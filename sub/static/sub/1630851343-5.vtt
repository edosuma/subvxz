00:00.868 --> 00:01.600
<i> [narrator] Previously</i>
<i>  on Queen Sugar...</i>

00:01.602 --> 00:02.668
There have
been recent photographs.

00:02.670 --> 00:05.004
Does this mean
that you and Davis
have reconciled?

00:05.006 --> 00:08.407
We're a work in progress,
but I have forgiven Davis.

00:08.409 --> 00:09.541
Your parents
hooked up again.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.943
You're worried about
your family back home.

00:10.945 --> 00:13.145
<i>  Your life's a little extra</i>
<i>  right now.</i>

00:13.147 --> 00:14.446
My daddy ain't killed nobody.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.613
Move.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.949
[Ralph Angel] [inaudible]
<i>  blood gave 'em the idea,</i>

00:16.951 --> 00:18.984
there are some bodies
still buried here.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.753
-How y'all boys meet?
-Prison, man.

00:20.755 --> 00:21.720
Yeah, what?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.756
I got a way
you can make some cash.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.891
[inaudible]
should not be on you.

00:25.893 --> 00:26.825
[worker] Got somethin'.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.428
[Police officer]
Guess it wasn't all lies.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.264
[Nova] Mm-hmm.

00:34.902 --> 00:35.934
Right.

00:41.909 --> 00:42.975
Mm-hmm.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.112
Oh! Great.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.981
Thank you.

00:49.617 --> 00:53.218
The good news is the judge
upheld the stay for the work
order to excavate the land,

00:53.220 --> 00:55.087
so they can't start
digging again.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.588
Well, that's positive.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.589
And I'm told
the forensic testing

00:57.591 --> 00:58.857
to determine
the nature of the bones

00:58.859 --> 01:02.928
is ongoing with no set time
to expect the results.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.264
So daddy's name just gets
dragged through the mud

01:05.266 --> 01:06.298
while they accuse him
of murder.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.601
My attorney said
that even if it's proven

01:09.603 --> 01:13.105
that those bones are related
to the families who are making
the accusations,

01:13.107 --> 01:14.907
and if they decide
to bring a civil suit,

01:14.909 --> 01:18.010
it's almost impossible
for them to win.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.945
That's a whole lot of ifs.

01:27.555 --> 01:34.026
["Nova" playing]

02:00.855 --> 02:02.387
Whatcha workin'
over there, beautiful?

02:02.389 --> 02:05.724
Mm. Darla needs this stuff.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.860
She's dealing with a lot,
every little bit helps.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.262
I hope she will eat
that chips.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.431
If so, you might wanna save
a couple of them.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.233
[laughs]

02:14.802 --> 02:16.101
Oh, here!

02:16.103 --> 02:17.669
Get 'em out of here
before I eat the whole bag.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.706
[Violet laughs]

02:20.708 --> 02:27.346
I swear this nonsense
with Ernest and the land
is working my nerves.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.082
Hollywood, I ate a full pint
of ice cream last night.

02:31.018 --> 02:35.020
You know how much
more of this my pressure
or my waistline can take.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.155
Oh, baby, you are beautiful

02:36.157 --> 02:39.424
and I love you
whether you are thick or thin.

02:39.426 --> 02:44.763
Yeah. Well, your baby does not
want to wind up with high
blood pressure, so here.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.532
[laughs]

02:46.534 --> 02:50.202
Get 'em out of here.
[laughs]

02:52.907 --> 02:55.941
I didn't know you had started
playing basketball again.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.043
Oh, man, that's Love, man!
He got me on it.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.145
Our boy love some Steph Curry.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.847
[whooshes]

03:01.849 --> 03:04.416
[laughs]

03:05.286 --> 03:06.985
Thank you, Hollywood.

03:08.822 --> 03:13.225
I know it first,
the whole Celine situation
didn't make you happy.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.160
-Vi don't even--
-But

03:15.162 --> 03:19.765
I just wanna say, I appreciate
how kind you're being
to her and Gabriel,

03:19.767 --> 03:20.999
for my sake.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.235
It means a lot to me.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.470
Well, you're welcome.
And trust me, baby,

03:25.472 --> 03:29.708
this whole Ernest drama
is gonna be over sooner
than you think, all right?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.444
And everything will go
right back to being good,
just watch.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.882
[Prosper] Good morning.

03:36.884 --> 03:37.549
Morning!

03:38.118 --> 03:40.752
I see you went to the bakery.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.522
Mm-hmm, you're early.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.091
You should have gone
to Fiona's.

03:46.093 --> 03:49.428
Well, these are organic
and they're less sugar.

03:50.864 --> 03:51.963
Maybe try one?

03:52.399 --> 03:56.134
Yeah, well. Fiona is
black-owned and is cheaper.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.670
I can't believe
Fiona's is still open.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.272
How's Ms. Fiona doing?

04:00.274 --> 04:02.874
Oh, she's doing it well
with the rest of us.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.142
Mm-hmm.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.778
[Prosper snickers]

04:06.780 --> 04:10.382
You remember that time
you got caught
shoplifting there?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.883
Shoplifting's a little harsh.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.419
What was that you took again?

04:14.421 --> 04:17.055
Ah, I can't remember,
I was like six.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.891
I didn't even understand
I was doing anything wrong.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.027
Some type of cookie.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.095
You want some coffee?

04:23.163 --> 04:24.396
I could make you some.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.398
Yeah, coffee sounds good.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.302
Yeah, don't make it
too hot this time.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.771
You already burned my cheek
on that last one, you made.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.175
Now that is not a problem
because...

04:37.945 --> 04:39.411
how about
we try something new?

04:41.115 --> 04:42.814
What in the world is this?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.082
I don't need this.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.817
A hundred dollars?

04:45.953 --> 04:49.688
It's so you can make
a nice hearty cup
anytime you want.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.491
It's a treat for you, since
you're not moving around so
much while you recuperate.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.893
Billie, I'm on a fixed income.

04:54.895 --> 04:59.665
I can't be buying fancy pots
of coffee and muffins.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.500
I paid for it, daddy.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.770
[stammers]
Oh, well, thank you.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.205
But I don't want you
wasting your money, either.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.612
What are you doing now?

05:13.614 --> 05:14.980
I'm taking it back.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.182
And I will go
to Fiona's instead.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.188
I'm just trying to make
you happy, daddy.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.024
[sighs]

05:37.404 --> 05:38.437
You all right?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.972
Ralph Angel, I'm scared.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.075
Scared about what?

05:44.411 --> 05:45.344
The baby...

05:46.280 --> 05:46.978
money.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.413
[groans]

05:49.416 --> 05:51.983
Please not worry
about this stuff.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.286
I'm taking care of it all.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.991
I just need you to relax.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.360
Stay healthy.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.431
For the both of you.
Focus on the good thing.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.367
I know, you say that,
but...

06:09.570 --> 06:13.038
they're up to our necks
in payday loans.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.141
The harvest you were counting
on is ruined.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.110
I got a plan B.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.046
What?

06:22.850 --> 06:25.016
I got some pick-up work
with my boy, Theo.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.152
Theo from prison.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.255
I used to be Ralph Angel
from prison...

06:31.158 --> 06:32.290
don't forget.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.227
Look he legit now.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.165
It ain't glamorous
but it will lead
to a full-time job...

06:41.301 --> 06:42.801
as warehouse work.

06:42.803 --> 06:46.405
Under the table
but it's good money.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.080
I meant what I said
in my vows...

06:57.017 --> 06:58.316
Imma take care of us.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.419
That's my word.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.232
[door opens]

07:15.736 --> 07:17.102
Hey!

07:18.772 --> 07:23.074
Okay, so you're early
if lunch is involved?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.676
-[Micah chuckles]
-Huh?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.144
Not that I'm complaining.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.213
-How are you?
-I'm good.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.182
Hmm?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.285
Since when are you
wearing cologne?

07:33.287 --> 07:34.352
Since forever.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.288
Hmm.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.389
[yawns]

07:38.058 --> 07:39.157
Tired?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.961
Mm, I'm sorry.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.429
[chuckles]

07:44.431 --> 07:47.165
I, um, haven't been sleeping.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.967
Oh, yeah? Work?

07:49.837 --> 07:51.503
Uh, worrying...

07:51.505 --> 07:55.240
worrying about those remains
on the farm.

07:55.242 --> 08:00.278
Worrying about
the Black American
Farmers Alliance lawsuit.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.049
Worrying about how
your father's adjusting
to his new life.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.350
And...

08:06.420 --> 08:09.721
I guess what's happening
with us,

08:09.789 --> 08:10.788
if I'm being honest.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.094
Everything is just,
it's in this weird limbo.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.699
Just got me out of sorts.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.902
I feel like
you like to be in control...

08:23.904 --> 08:27.105
and we can't always be.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.242
We can't.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.281
[sighs]

08:38.085 --> 08:39.251
Do you feel that way?

08:39.853 --> 08:40.986
I do.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.421
And I've been having these
like...

08:44.024 --> 08:46.024
moments at school.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.292
What kind of moments?

08:49.496 --> 08:50.962
Anxiety.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.367
Yeah, I've been thinking
a lot about Mr. Prosper and...

08:56.703 --> 08:59.671
my own experience
with police abuse.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.340
And what I realize
and I have to remind myself

09:02.342 --> 09:05.210
that I can't control
any of that.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.115
The only thing that I can
control is how I respond
to it, you know?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.218
Some pretty heavy stuff.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.988
Big realizations.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.959
Proud of you.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.097
Thank you.

09:28.502 --> 09:29.500
[Nova] I know my rights, sir.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.969
Those bones were found
on my family's land.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.705
[Forensic expert]
In conjunction with
a criminal investigation?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.707
Barely,
and you and I both know it.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.809
-I know no such thing.
-Look,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.678
I'm making
a reasonable request.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.013
I simply want to be notified
by your department

09:42.015 --> 09:43.815
before the forensic results
are made public.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.016
Is that too much to ask?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.851
That's not how
this process works.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.186
Then how does it work?

09:49.156 --> 09:50.989
Are we finished, Ms. Bordelon?

09:52.559 --> 09:54.025
For now.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.763
[Violet] Okay, baby,
so let me read that back.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.267
Peach cobbler,
uh, one blueberry pie,
two lunch specials,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.269
and two sweet teas.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.137
Right?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.039
Okay.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.776
All right. Ooh,
you better knock it off
before I tell your wife.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.811
[Violet laughs]

10:12.813 --> 10:15.280
All right, see you
in a minute, baby.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.721
-[Violet] Ah, this is for you.
-Thank you.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.755
[Violet laughs]

10:23.757 --> 10:26.391
[Violet] Look at you.
You are glowing.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.093
Still so huge.
[Darla grumbles]

10:28.095 --> 10:31.429
You are hardly huge
and even if you were,
so what?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.530
You're pregnant.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.333
-You hungry?
-Oh, no, no thank you.
I'm, uh...

10:36.169 --> 10:38.003
I haven't had much
of an appetite lately.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.038
Morning sickness?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.307
Then, what's wrong?

10:43.610 --> 10:44.409
[Darla sighs]

10:44.411 --> 10:46.111
What is it, baby?
You can tell me.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.381
I'm worried about Ralph Angel.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.218
He's put under
a lot of pressure.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.253
Lord.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.891
Darling, you know that me
and my hard-headed nephew

10:59.893 --> 11:01.760
are not on the best
of terms right now.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.128
You're right. I, uh...

11:03.130 --> 11:04.963
I shouldn't be talking
about this with you.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.766
No, we're family.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.402
I'm exactly who
you should be talking to.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.937
Even if we're not
on good terms,

11:12.939 --> 11:16.007
I'm always here
for you and him,
always.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.076
So?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.383
I... I have some money.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.620
It's not a lot,

11:28.622 --> 11:32.257
but, um, enough
to pay some bills.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.994
Take the edge off of things
a little bit, maybe.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.396
I don't see how
that's a problem.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.400
The money that I have...

11:42.402 --> 11:46.805
it's an account
that my parents set up for me
for college a while ago.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.108
And Ralph Angel
found out about it.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.309
How did he do that?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.244
I told him.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.246
Uh...

11:55.248 --> 11:58.016
I see, and he don't want
you to use that money.

11:59.052 --> 11:59.784
Right.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.286
But, uh...

12:02.723 --> 12:05.156
I asked them
to sign it over to me anyway.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.126
I feel uneasy about it, um,

12:08.128 --> 12:10.095
keeping things from him.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.965
But I need to contribute.

12:14.868 --> 12:19.204
I need to feel
that I'm part of the solution
to our problems, you know.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.040
Do you know how
I feel about that?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.143
Good for you.

12:25.145 --> 12:30.415
Every woman in her right mind
should have a little stash
of her own if she can.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.583
I mean, just in case.

12:34.121 --> 12:39.090
I have two accounts
that Hollywood don't know
nothing about.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.692
[both laugh]

12:40.694 --> 12:42.293
Good for you, baby.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.998
Everything
is gonna be all right.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.935
[Ralph Angel] Yo.
Anybody, home?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.237
Lord, here come trouble.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.404
[Prosper] How about trouble?

12:53.406 --> 12:54.806
Hey, you!

12:54.808 --> 12:57.108
[Hollywood laughs]
You're a different
story, Old G.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.078
-Oh, hey.
-Yeah, wassup man?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.680
You did good, young man.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.949
-You did good.
-Did I?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.685
Means a whole lot
coming from you, Prosper.
All right?

13:07.687 --> 13:08.920
Y'all boy, sit down.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.188
-Whatcha all drinking on?
-Oh, man.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.823
Oh, Mia.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.259
-Whatever you want, I'm easy.
-[Hollywood] Brown it is.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.294
[sighs]

13:17.964 --> 13:18.863
Oh.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.934
Hollywood, Vi mad at me?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.770
Sorry, you're about
the only one she's not mad at.

13:25.772 --> 13:26.971
Facts.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.207
Why is she mad at you?

13:29.209 --> 13:31.109
She not still upset
about Blue, is she?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.377
-Yep!
-Yep!

13:33.914 --> 13:35.213
What she mad at you for?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.815
-Billie.
-Hmm.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.083
Yeah, ever since
she's been back,

13:39.085 --> 13:40.785
it's just so hard
connecting with her.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.755
I mean, one minute is good,
the next minute is bad,

13:43.757 --> 13:46.424
the minute after that
is even worse.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.494
Yeah, but the other day,
Vi came over

13:49.496 --> 13:53.832
and, well, I defended Billie
when they got into it

13:53.834 --> 13:56.634
I wouldn't hurt Vi
because she's done
so much for me.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.870
I mean, the whole family has.

13:58.872 --> 14:02.674
Now, Prosper,
a good man upstairs
gave you another shot.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.209
Why you think he did that?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.245
You can get right with Billie?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.080
I don't know with you.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.151
That's what I'd do
if I have more time with Pops.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.787
Man, I don't even worry
about Vi, all right.

14:15.789 --> 14:16.954
She loves you.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.224
She didn't say nothing to me
about nothing being wrong.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.692
And even though she did,
she'd be all right.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.260
[laughing]

14:22.262 --> 14:25.630
So here's to not letting
the bad days
get the best of us.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.431
Amen.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.766
Good to have you
back, Prosper.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.401
Thank you.
It's good to be back.

14:31.071 --> 14:31.903
[knocking on door]

14:31.905 --> 14:33.238
[Nova] Come in.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.745
Got your rolling papers.
Voila!

14:40.747 --> 14:41.946
Thank you.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.514
I'm a mess, I know.
[chuckles]

14:43.516 --> 14:44.849
Join me?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.951
No, I wish.
Maybe next time,
I'm swamped.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.953
What's got you
all worked up, anyway?

14:48.955 --> 14:50.889
You got folks
losing their minds again?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.625
Did you write another
Pulitzer Prize winning piece

14:53.627 --> 14:55.660
on the Karen's
or White Supremacy
for True Papers?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.896
That's a great idea,
seriously.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.497
But until this family
drama is resolved,

14:59.499 --> 15:01.699
I'm having a hard time
focusing on True Papers,

15:01.701 --> 15:06.170
but as soon as it is,
I already know what
I'm gonna write about next.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.942
Oh, so you're just gonna
leave me hanging like that.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.412
You can read it
when everyone else does,
neighbor.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.614
-Oh, it's like that.
-Hmm.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.082
-That's mine.
-Oh, thank you!

15:18.084 --> 15:20.051
-You're welcome.
-[Nova laughs]

15:38.104 --> 15:39.404
What's up, boy?

15:39.406 --> 15:40.905
Yo, you gotta get
inside there, man.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.774
That DJ in there rockin', boy.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.242
Classic no limit
all night, man.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.311
I'm straight.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.112
What's up with you?

15:48.848 --> 15:51.282
I just need a little
more details on that thing
you was talking about.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.184
Like I said, man...

15:54.321 --> 15:56.621
it ain't no risk, bro.

15:56.623 --> 16:03.061
I got family now, kids.
I need them
to be proud of me.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.164
Families expect me to provide.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.765
I don't give a damn
how you do it

16:07.767 --> 16:10.868
as long as you're doing it.
You feel me?

16:10.870 --> 16:12.971
Besides man,
I need somebody
I can trust on this one, bro.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.173
and I haven't count
somebody's on one hand.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.308
And you're one of them, bro.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.220
-You run a hard bargain', boy.
-I never like that.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.122
[inaudible]

16:31.124 --> 16:33.958
Man, you go back like babies
and pacifiers, bro.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.029
The last thing I want to see
is you lose your farm.

16:42.535 --> 16:46.237
You know what,
I'll take an L with my cut...

16:47.107 --> 16:49.107
just to make sure you're good.
All right?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.342
Whatcha need?

16:53.179 --> 16:56.047
You know what?
Matter of fact, here.
There you go.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.415
You good?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.290
Why you doing this bro?

17:07.894 --> 17:10.161
You looked out for me
when we was doing
our [inaudible].

17:10.563 --> 17:12.964
Just tryin' to pay
you back, bro.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.368
You're reliable
Ralph Angel.
Ain't a whole lot of us left.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.039
We need to stick together,
bro.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.211
I'm going back in, man.
You sure you
don't wanna come?

17:27.847 --> 17:28.446
Na.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.015
[both laugh]

17:32.886 --> 17:36.087
Listen,
we stronger together, bro.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.162
[sighs]

17:49.002 --> 17:50.301
Hey!
[chuckles]

17:51.404 --> 17:52.970
[Nova clears throat]

17:54.074 --> 17:55.306
You're famous.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.643
Infamous is more like it.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.812
Black Twitter's
letting me have it.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.448
Been there, done that.
Black Twitter ain't no joke.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.884
You know, I talked about a lot
of important stuff
with Gayle King.

18:06.886 --> 18:11.189
Somehow,
all that gets overlooked
and I become a silly meme.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.058
Do you wanna put these on ice?

18:14.060 --> 18:17.395
With the week I'm having,
don't be surprised if I drink
straight from the bottle.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.331
Okay. Heard that.

18:27.941 --> 18:31.142
Well, they say
you know the food is good,
when black folks is quiet.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.778
It's why it sound like
a library up in here.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.812
[Hollywood laughs]

18:34.814 --> 18:36.180
He's right. He's right.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.015
You put your foot
in this food.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.017
Eww, in chicken too?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.786
[Hollywood laughs]
No, son.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.387
It's just an expression,
all right?

18:43.389 --> 18:46.023
She didn't really put
her foot in the food.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.425
-Oh!
-[all laugh]

18:48.928 --> 18:50.294
This food is good, Miss Vi.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.496
Thank you, baby.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.065
Now, I never thought
I'd see the day

18:54.067 --> 18:58.102
when my child would ask
for seconds of vegetable.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.571
Mm-mm. You a miracle worker.

19:00.573 --> 19:04.809
I think Mr. Man has something
to do with it as well.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.345
You know what, baby.
I'm gonna have
to save this for later.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.982
I'm gonna save mine
for later too.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.185
Come on, Gab,
there's something I wanna
show in the living room

19:17.857 --> 19:19.390
I got some good news.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.728
Girl, the way things
have been going lately,

19:23.730 --> 19:26.063
I could use some good news.
What you got?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.099
That attorney you gave me...

19:28.735 --> 19:32.069
he called and got
the paperwork started
on my divorce.

19:32.071 --> 19:36.374
Oh, certainly, that's great
news. Good for you, girl.

19:36.743 --> 19:37.909
[Gabriel] Mommy!

19:37.911 --> 19:39.410
Look at what
Mr. Hollywood got me.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.945
What is that?

19:40.947 --> 19:41.679
A basketball.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.214
-Oh, let me see.
-No.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.216
-Well, did you say thank you?
-He sure did.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.451
Well, I didn't, so thank you.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.853
[both grunt]

19:48.855 --> 19:51.622
Don't you dare bounce
that basketball
at Miss Vi's house.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.126
I tell you what,
go out on the porch

19:55.128 --> 19:57.495
and just dribble it
with your left hand I'll be
out there in a minute, okay?

19:57.497 --> 19:59.096
Yes, sir.

20:00.099 --> 20:04.969
He adores you
and you're just so good
and gentle with him.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.470
Thank you for that.

20:07.974 --> 20:14.979
And, Queen Vi,
thank you, girl
for everything.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.049
What ya'll [inaudible]
back together...

20:18.384 --> 20:20.084
that's just amazing.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.223
If you could bottle it up
and sell it, you'd be rich.

20:28.928 --> 20:29.660
[knocking on door]

20:29.662 --> 20:30.962
Come in.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.130
Hey, have you seen
my meal card?

20:33.132 --> 20:34.198
I can't find it anywhere.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.200
No, just take mine.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.368
Thanks.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.173
Hey, uh, how you feeling, man?
You've been meditating?

20:42.809 --> 20:43.574
I've been trying to.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.975
Nice, yeah.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.079
Well, the more you make
it a daily practice,
the easier it gets.

20:48.081 --> 20:52.149
You know, I've actually
been experiencing
that and I really like it.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.286
-Good, man. Good.
-Yeah.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.656
Hey, what is that?
Those are lit.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.890
This, oh, man,
just some photos I took

20:59.892 --> 21:02.326
from my Uncle Hollywood's
grand opening.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.931
I knew you're
into photography
but damn, bro.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.267
-You got skills.
-Thank you.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.501
Hey, you should take
some pictures of me.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.202
What for?

21:13.106 --> 21:15.706
I know it sounds hella shallow
but I need some new pictures
for my social profiles

21:15.708 --> 21:17.642
and whatnot.
[laughing]

21:17.644 --> 21:21.178
-A social profile?
-You know what it is, man.
I'm a good looking dude.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.114
I should be getting
hit up more than I do.

21:23.216 --> 21:23.981
All right.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.316
Um...

21:25.952 --> 21:26.951
I'm at it. Let's do it.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.153
Dude, all right.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.791
Not here, bro.
Let's go on campus.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.826
More space. You can get
the natural light on you.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.929
Fine, but can we go
to the dining hall first?
I'm starving.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.631
Okay, so you wanna have
a meatball sub

21:40.633 --> 21:41.999
before we do the photoshoot?

21:42.001 --> 21:43.601
You're right?
Yeah, we'll go after.

21:43.603 --> 21:46.170
Kidding man.
Typical model, bro.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.907
[Micah] No, I need to get
some shots actually.

21:49.909 --> 21:50.975
[Isaiah] Nice.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.743
[Nova laughing]

21:52.745 --> 21:55.012
I totally forgot about that.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.614
Daddy was so mad at us.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.615
Mm-hmm.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.750
Now, I don't know
who y'all think I am.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.252
But I'll tell you
who I ain't...

22:01.988 --> 22:03.087
[both]
One of your little friends.

22:03.089 --> 22:06.123
[both laughing]

22:08.161 --> 22:10.428
I miss him so much.

22:11.397 --> 22:12.430
-Me too.
-Mm.

22:12.598 --> 22:15.032
I wish he were here now.

22:15.034 --> 22:18.269
Yeah, sure. Make finding out
about those bones
a lot easier.

22:23.743 --> 22:27.178
Daddy didn't kill anyone,
right?

22:27.714 --> 22:31.649
No, of course not.
And if he did,

22:31.651 --> 22:34.185
he had good reason
and no other alternative.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.862
-I need some more wine.
-You read my mind.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.763
[laughs]

22:45.765 --> 22:49.133
-Uh-oh.
-[laughs]

22:50.403 --> 22:52.269
Oh, can you grab me
two eggs, please?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.772
I've never known you to bake.

22:54.774 --> 22:59.143
Yeah, I've read once
baking can have
a calming effect on you.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.278
I tried it and it worked.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.646
Really?

23:02.648 --> 23:05.483
Yeah, might have
something to do with,

23:05.485 --> 23:08.018
I don't know,
have a control over

23:08.020 --> 23:12.123
something in your life
and other things
are out of control.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.391
-Hmm.
-You should try it.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.428
I mean, yeah,
no, I think I'll stick
to the wine.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.864
[laughing]

23:19.866 --> 23:22.099
I am not mad at it.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.069
-Good fix.
-[laughing]

23:25.872 --> 23:28.973
[thunder rumbling]

23:31.411 --> 23:32.343
God.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.214
I don't come to you often.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.287
You remember the last time
I've been to church...

23:44.957 --> 23:46.357
and open up a Bible?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.160
[sighs]

23:50.596 --> 23:52.029
I'm bad for that.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.069
I know what I'm doing
and that is...

23:59.839 --> 24:01.172
it's wrong.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.009
This is for
the right reasons now.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.344
I know it's wrong.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.219
I probably shouldn't
ask you this but...

24:16.823 --> 24:20.157
[Ralph Angel sobbing]

24:22.028 --> 24:24.128
keep me safe tonight, please.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.101
I promise from here on now,

24:34.040 --> 24:35.239
Imma do right.

24:36.943 --> 24:41.045
Imma be the type
of man my family
could be proud of.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.215
That's my word.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.423
[sighs]

24:53.025 --> 24:54.091
Amen.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.131
Oh, shit.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.448
Slight change of plans.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.750
What you mean,
slight change of plans?

25:19.752 --> 25:23.087
One of my guys pulled off
so Imma need your help
to load this truck, all right?

25:24.824 --> 25:27.124
It's always some
bullshit, huh?

25:27.793 --> 25:30.995
If you don't wanna do it,
don't do it, bro.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.030
Just give me back
the money and we straight.
All right?

25:37.403 --> 25:38.402
C'mon!

25:38.404 --> 25:39.436
Good, man.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.354
Hey, you hear somethin'?

25:57.423 --> 25:58.355
[Theo] What?

26:00.693 --> 26:03.127
-I could've swore
I heard some.
-Paranoid.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.162
Granted we out out here.
But I ain't playin' games.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.231
Just hurry up.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.300
Almost finished.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.273
All right, that's a wrap.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.208
Lookin' all big.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.178
See you on the next one,
aight?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.914
So, there be no next one, bro.
I'm done.

26:23.916 --> 26:29.019
All right. Respect, bro.
Great doin'
business with you.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.867
Oh, that was fast.

26:43.869 --> 26:47.838
I literally just
dropped them off at the motel.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.873
Oh, that Gabriel can talk.

26:49.875 --> 26:50.975
[both chuckle]

26:50.977 --> 26:52.209
You tell it.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.745
He wore me out.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.980
What he talkin' about?

26:56.682 --> 26:59.917
What else? You.

26:59.919 --> 27:03.087
Mr. Hollywood this,
Mr. Hollywood that.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.288
Whoo.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.991
It was cute though.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.229
You know, Hollywood...

27:13.699 --> 27:15.199
you've been different lately?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.368
No, wait look, in a good way.

27:18.738 --> 27:23.240
I think Gabriel has brought
something out of you
I ain't never seen before.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.448
You know, we're always
gonna have kids in our lives.

27:31.450 --> 27:38.989
You know, Micah, Blue,
the new baby...

27:38.991 --> 27:43.193
and I wouldn't be surprised
if Nova winds up having kids,
at some point.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.264
But it could never
gonna be ours.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.999
I know that.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.308
And you're still
okay with that?

28:00.546 --> 28:06.150
Without passing on your
last name or your legacy.

28:06.152 --> 28:11.188
Vi, legacy is about
more than just kids.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.157
[chuckles]

28:15.861 --> 28:17.227
[Hollywood laughs]

28:37.049 --> 28:40.884
[police siren wailing]

28:40.886 --> 28:43.087
Oh, shit.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.273
[sighs]

29:05.010 --> 29:06.009
Thank you.

29:25.698 --> 29:26.296
All right.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.831
[Violet clears throat]

29:27.833 --> 29:29.032
[Violet] Mm.

29:35.074 --> 29:38.275
So, what's the verdict?

29:39.411 --> 29:40.344
Good.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.413
-Okay.
-[Charley laughs]

29:44.784 --> 29:47.084
Now, let's get to why
you're really here.

29:47.086 --> 29:50.888
I know it's not
so that I could sample
your pastries.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.356
[sighs]

29:52.358 --> 29:54.992
Why else would I be here?
[Charley chuckles]

29:54.994 --> 29:59.096
Charley Bordelon,
I've known you longer
than you've known yourself.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.064
So what's up?

30:05.204 --> 30:07.037
It's about Davis.

30:07.706 --> 30:08.972
What'd he do now?

30:08.974 --> 30:10.541
Nothing.
Nothing wrong, at least.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.042
Just...

30:13.412 --> 30:17.548
-social media
is going crazy and I...
-Oh, Charley!

30:17.550 --> 30:19.349
Social media.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.655
Why do you care so much
about what folks think

30:24.657 --> 30:28.692
about who you
in a relationship with?

30:28.694 --> 30:31.361
Most of those folks
you don't know
from a can of paint.

30:31.764 --> 30:35.999
Good question, and good point.

30:38.871 --> 30:43.173
Look, first,
you post a picture
of you and Davis online

30:43.175 --> 30:46.643
for the world to see
and comment on.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.980
And then you go up
on Gayle King's show

30:49.982 --> 30:54.451
and try to sell those folks
your rights to your business.

30:54.453 --> 30:57.154
You are just asking
for trouble, baby.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.060
Have I ever asked you what
you thought of Hollywood?

31:04.363 --> 31:07.898
Not that I can recall, no.

31:07.900 --> 31:13.003
Exactly.
Because I'm in a relationship
with him, you ain't.

31:13.672 --> 31:17.975
Trouble is bound to find
its way into a relationship.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.411
Me? I'm just not gonna go out
and invite trouble there.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.317
True love is sacred,
it's a blessing.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.121
You need to start
treating it like it is.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.360
Thanks, Aunt Vi.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.097
That is why I came here today.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.032
-One other thing.
-Mm-hmm.

31:42.635 --> 31:44.234
Leave the baking to me.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.006
These cupcakes,
as dry as I don't know what.

31:49.008 --> 31:54.344
Mm. Those are...
Those are croissants, Aunt Vi.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.013
-Oh Lord.
-Mm-hmm.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.848
[Violet laughs]

31:57.850 --> 31:58.482
Just a...
[Violet laughs]

31:58.484 --> 32:00.317
-Oh, baby.
-Yeah.

32:03.822 --> 32:09.927
Damn Nova,
I mean, knew you were talented
but this is, girl?

32:09.929 --> 32:12.029
[chuckles softly]
Thank you.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.265
You're also asking
for trouble.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.267
Good old boys in blue
won't be happy

32:17.269 --> 32:19.369
when you put this
on True Papers.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.972
-You sure you wanna do this?
-I'm very sure.

32:31.951 --> 32:37.988
Nova, I... I owe you
an apology for how
I told your father

32:37.990 --> 32:39.423
about your private life
back then.

32:40.726 --> 32:46.129
It was wrong
under any circumstance,
and I'm truly sorry.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.133
I've wanted to hear
that for a long time.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.270
Apology accepted.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.976
It's time we focus
on the future, not the past.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.845
Deep down, I always hoped
that we make up

33:01.847 --> 33:04.047
for how things went
down back then.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.784
But as time went on,
I just...

33:07.786 --> 33:10.220
I don't know, I started
to lose hope, I guess.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.194
You were my first
best friend, Nova.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.297
My only best friend...

33:21.767 --> 33:24.167
and I know this is stupid.

33:25.838 --> 33:30.674
But for years, I would
always compare
my new friends to you.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.842
[Nova laughs]

33:31.844 --> 33:33.877
That's not stupid.
I did the same thing.

33:33.879 --> 33:34.978
You did?

33:35.748 --> 33:37.314
[laughs]

33:38.650 --> 33:41.618
-It's just that nobody
ever measured up.
-Hmm.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.688
Just one big disappointment
after another.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.224
At some point,
I just stopped trying.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.162
Your shoes
are too big to fill.

33:55.834 --> 34:01.004
I guess what
I'm trying to say, Nova, is,
not that it's easy...

34:02.875 --> 34:04.341
but I'm really glad
you're back in my life.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.077
Me too.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.211
[both laugh]

34:10.982 --> 34:11.481
There he is.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.649
Hey, my bad.
Sorry we're late.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.385
You're here now.
Don't matter,
just grab a glass.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.654
-It's a little early
for champagne, ain't it?
-[laughs]

34:17.656 --> 34:19.890
Hey, it is never
too early for champagne.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.025
So ya'll drunk already, huh?

34:22.027 --> 34:25.228
Today was a good day, ya'll.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.763
Our family had a win.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.670
My brother, your father,
Ernest Bordelon
was a good man.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.205
[Ralph Angel] That's right.

34:36.041 --> 34:40.510
A man whose name
and legacy remains
untarnished.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.579
Thanks to
Nova's investigation.

34:42.581 --> 34:47.651
We now know that those remains
were 150 years old,

34:47.653 --> 34:53.156
which means that
them old bones just prove
what we already knew.

34:53.158 --> 34:56.059
Ernest Bordelon
didn't kill nobody.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.427
Say it.

34:58.831 --> 34:59.963
Here's to Ernest!

34:59.965 --> 35:01.264
[all] To daddy.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.973
Them bones they
knew they thought it was...

35:11.176 --> 35:15.245
I just wonder,
man, whose are they really?

35:30.796 --> 35:32.028
Wassup?

35:32.097 --> 35:34.431
Yo. How did that test go?

35:36.068 --> 35:40.237
Uh, let's just say,
it went and it's over.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.739
And we shall see?
[laughs]

35:42.741 --> 35:45.976
Confidence man.
That's incredible.

35:45.978 --> 35:50.247
Uh, I was ill-prepared.
I just didn't study enough.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.381
Why not?

35:51.550 --> 35:53.183
Life?

35:53.185 --> 35:55.385
How was I supposed to focus
on these tests and stuff,

35:55.387 --> 35:59.089
-when we're in the midst
of the most dynamic of times?
-Yeah.

35:59.091 --> 36:01.024
This is supposed to be
the time of our lives.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.359
-Right?
-Period.

36:03.662 --> 36:07.130
I don't know. I'm...
I'm just feeling restless.

36:07.132 --> 36:09.866
I'm ready for
an adventure or something.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.401
I feel you.

36:12.971 --> 36:18.108
I thought, you know what?
How about we adventure
over to Ten Cent Tacos?

36:18.110 --> 36:19.409
Your boy is famished.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.178
You got it.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.215
Hey, like, um...

36:25.984 --> 36:28.885
You know, if you ever
need anybody to talk to,

36:28.887 --> 36:31.354
I'm here for you,
the way you were
here for me.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.192
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah, of course, man.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.796
Um...

36:39.798 --> 36:42.132
[inaudible]
tacos for the honors.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.167
[Isaiah] Come on,
it's no joke.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.204
[Darla] This is nice.

36:47.206 --> 36:52.209
This, getting to be out,
to feel normal again.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.779
Yeah...

36:55.781 --> 36:57.981
if you like this, you're gonna
love what I got planned.

36:58.850 --> 36:59.883
You got plan?

36:59.918 --> 37:01.051
[chuckles]

37:01.053 --> 37:02.819
We're going on a babymoon.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.754
A babymoon?
[chuckles]

37:04.756 --> 37:06.990
Since our honeymoon
got cut a little short.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.125
Figured we do something nice.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.828
Got us a little,

37:11.830 --> 37:13.964
B&B in the garden district.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.966
They got everything.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.068
Check it out.

37:18.070 --> 37:22.239
Fireplace, jacuzzi,
walk-in showers.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.241
It's nice, right?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.009
It is.

37:27.246 --> 37:31.214
I just feel like everything
we've been going through,
we deserve it.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.851
It is beautiful.
but I don't...

37:34.853 --> 37:37.354
-It's only for a few days.
-I know but still...

37:37.489 --> 37:39.155
It's a lot.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.995
I worked the double shift
last night with Theo,
I got double pay.

37:46.398 --> 37:53.270
Come on, I'm working another
shift next week too, okay?

37:56.074 --> 38:00.977
I got you. I got us.
We're gonna be all right.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.317
[knocking on door]

38:08.987 --> 38:10.153
[Nova sighs]

38:15.794 --> 38:16.559
-Boom.
-[Nova chuckles]

38:16.561 --> 38:18.161
[Dominic] I got what you want.

38:18.163 --> 38:21.298
That's not the kind of favor
I called in for my friend,
but thank you.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.233
[Nova laughs]

38:25.971 --> 38:31.274
Second time being summoned
to Casa de Nova this week,
starting to feel special.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.311
Well, kind of need
a special favor?

38:34.613 --> 38:37.047
What's happening?

38:37.049 --> 38:39.883
I need some further testing
done on the remains found
on my family's farm.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.418
I think you can point me
in the right direction.

38:42.387 --> 38:43.352
[Nova laughs]

38:43.354 --> 38:45.588
I can do it for you
at the university.

38:45.590 --> 38:48.892
I'll find the right
people who can,
might take a minute though.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.393
That's fine,
I'm a patient woman.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.428
Is that right?

38:54.800 --> 39:01.037
Well, maybe one day,
some of that can rub off of
me. I could use some patience.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.910
You wanna, uh, go for a jog?

39:06.912 --> 39:10.046
I was just gonna head out
for my evening run.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.349
It'll be cool to have some...
some company.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.719
Sure. A jog would be nice.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.053
I just need to change.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.155
Of course, I'll be patient.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.803
[sighs]

39:33.805 --> 39:36.039
Sure smells clean in here.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.808
I may have overdone
on the pine scent.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.276
Yeah, that's it.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.278
It's spotless, uh...

39:44.383 --> 39:48.952
You really outdid yourself
this time, Maybillie.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.224
And you haven't
called me that
since I was a little girl.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.761
If you did,
I was either in trouble

39:57.763 --> 40:00.997
or you were reading me
bedtime stories.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.066
I'm too old
for bedtime stories.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.100
Says who?

40:07.139 --> 40:11.408
Yeah, I want to thank you
for being here.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.245
You don't have
to thank me, daddy.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.214
I'm your daughter,
I'm supposed to be here.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.322
Uh, yeah.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.291
[chuckles]

40:29.795 --> 40:30.927
It's donut holes.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.901
You know,
I got caught in Fiona's,
it was donut holes.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.135
[laughs]

40:39.404 --> 40:42.138
Yeah, I remember that.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.008
Oh, you used to love those
things when you were little.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.643
[both laugh]

40:46.678 --> 40:49.512
Nothing made you happier.

40:49.514 --> 40:54.050
You'd eat a whole pack
for breakfast if we didn't
keep an eye on you.

40:57.889 --> 41:02.292
Wasn't really shoplifting,
you were curious.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.031
You are always
your own person, Billie.

41:09.534 --> 41:12.168
And sometimes
that didn't fit in to

41:12.170 --> 41:14.404
what I wanted you to be,
and I was wrong for that.

41:14.406 --> 41:16.072
[sighs]

41:17.409 --> 41:23.012
I, uh, hope you can forgive me
for all the times
that I failed you.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.317
I love you so much.

41:29.087 --> 41:33.089
I'm sorry for anything
I ever did
that embarrassed you.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.392
I made you feel like
I wasn't worthy of your love.

41:37.762 --> 41:43.266
You were always worthy
and I love you so much.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.240
[both crying]
