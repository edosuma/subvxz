WEBVTT

00:07.680 --> 00:10.046
SHAWN, WHERE'S THAT
NICE NEW SWEATER VEST

00:10.080 --> 00:13.459
YOUR MOM JUST PUT ON YOU
FOR PICTURE DAY?

00:13.490 --> 00:16.823
OH, YEAH, THAT.

00:16.860 --> 00:19.636
IT WASN'T WORKING
FOR US.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.830
WE CHOSE THE KNIGHT RIDER SHIRT
INSTEAD.

00:20.870 --> 00:24.078
MOM LOVES K.I.T.T.

00:24.110 --> 00:25.441
DO YOU KNOW
HOW A COP DISTINGUISHES

00:25.480 --> 00:26.572
WHEN SOMEBODY'S LYING?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.838
WHEN IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.222
GO UPSTAIRS,
PUT THE VEST BACK ON.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.659
PICTURES LAST FOREVER,
SHAWN.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.169
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
YOUR BEST.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.449
THERE'S A BODY
IN A SERVICE ELEVATOR?

00:42.480 --> 00:43.640
NO BODIES.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.181
A DOGFIGHEING RING?

00:45.220 --> 00:46.619
A MISSING SNOWMAN?

00:46.660 --> 00:48.480
YES, A SNOWMAN IS MISSING,
BUT WE'RE NOT ON THAT CASE.

00:48.530 --> 00:50.259
RELAX.
I AM NOT WORKING.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.268
I KNOW YOU AREN'T.
I DO NOT WORK
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.767
I THINK YOU'VE MADE
YOUR POSITION CLEAR ON THAT.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.165
THEN TELL ME WHERE
WE'RE GOING.

00:55.210 --> 00:56.529
THAT'S NOT HOW
A SURPRISE WORKS.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.310
(Shawn)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DUDE.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.614
WELCOME TO THE FALL LINE
LAUNCH PARTY

01:01.650 --> 01:03.880
FOR CIAO CLOTHING.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.559
GORGEOUS MODELS,
FAKE CELEBRITIES.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.261
NO FOOD, THOUGH.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.767
THIS IS THE MOST EXCLUSIVE EVENT
OF THE YEAR.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.789
WHAT'S THE RUB?

01:10.840 --> 01:13.172
[loud music inside]

01:13.210 --> 01:15.269
I THINK YOU'RE IN THE WRONG LINE
THERE, GENTLEMEN.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.948
I THINK WE'RE ON
THE V.I.P. LIST.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.915
NAMES?
BLACK AND TAN.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.825
FIRST NAMES?
NO FIRST NAMES.

01:21.860 --> 01:22.929
ONE OF US IS BLACK,
AND ONE OF US IS TAN.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.791
WE'RE A MODELING TEAM.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.866
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD
OF US.
LET'S JUST GO.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.801
WE'RE RETIRED.
JUST CHECK YOUR LIST.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.778
HOLY CRAP, IT IS HERE.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.627
SORRY FOR THE MIX-UP, TAN.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.422
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

01:41.470 --> 01:45.236
MY NAME IS BLACK.
HIS NAME IS TAN.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.636
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST MADE
THAT ASSUMPTION.
[scoffs]

01:47.680 --> 01:50.410
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.517
[dance music]

01:53.560 --> 01:55.289
OKAY, HOW DID YOU
PULL THAT OFF?

01:55.330 --> 01:57.594
WELL, CIAO'S NUMBER WAS
IN THE PHONE BOOK.

01:57.630 --> 02:00.235
I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR AGAIN
THAT MY FILIPINO ACCENT

02:00.240 --> 02:01.969
DOESN'T WORK MAGIC.

02:02.010 --> 02:03.272
(Gus)
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
THOUGHTFUL PRESENTS

02:03.310 --> 02:04.641
ANYONE'S EVER GIVEN ME.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.481
OH, MAN, THAT'S
BERLINDA DESIDOVICZ!

02:10.520 --> 02:12.351
THE WAITRESS?

02:12.390 --> 02:13.652
(Gus)
SHE'S NOT A WAITRESS,
SHE'S THE MODEL.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.588
THE ONE FROM
THE FLOPPYCAKES AD.

02:15.630 --> 02:16.767
THE THIRD GIRL ON THE LEFT

02:16.800 --> 02:18.028
ON THAT BILLBOARD
I ALWAYS POINT OUT.

02:18.070 --> 02:19.332
YOU KNOW HER NAME?

02:19.380 --> 02:20.972
HER NAME?
I KNOW HER LIFE STORY.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.079
SHE HAS A FAN CLUB.

02:22.110 --> 02:22.940
WELL, SHE'S PUTTING ONE
TOGETHER.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.414
I'M NUMBER ONE
ON THE INTEREST LIST.

02:25.450 --> 02:26.587
SHE'S ONE
OF THE MOST POPULAR MODELS

02:26.620 --> 02:29.088
IN THE ENTIRE SANTA BARBARA
DOWNTOWN AREA, SHAWN.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.826
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH HER
SINCE THE ICY POPS AD.

02:31.870 --> 02:33.690
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT SAYS "GOOEY."

02:33.740 --> 02:35.503
YES, SHE'S THE "GOOEY" GIRL.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.474
THIS IS HUGE
FOR YOU, MAN.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.875
I'LL HOOK IT UP.
WHOA.

02:38.910 --> 02:40.912
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS MYSELF.

02:40.950 --> 02:44.078
WHAT YOU THINK?
SHOULD I PULL OUT THE CHEETAH?

02:44.120 --> 02:46.122
THE CHEETAH IS THE WORST NAME
FOR A PICKUP MOVE

02:46.160 --> 02:48.390
IN THE HISTORY
OF MANKIND.

02:48.430 --> 02:51.069
REMEMBER THE RULE:
TREAT A WOMAN LIKE A PERSON,

02:51.100 --> 02:51.964
THEN A PRINCESS,

02:52.010 --> 02:55.104
THEN A GREEK GODDESS,
THEN A PERSON AGAIN.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.870
BESIDES, I THINK OPERATION:
COLONEL SUGARLEMONS

02:57.920 --> 02:59.785
IS A MUCH BETTER MOVE
FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.380
COOL.
GOOD LUCK.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.887
(woman)
OH, EMILY!

03:15.920 --> 03:17.478
[man over p.a.]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

03:17.520 --> 03:22.526
OUR CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER,
GREGOR UWE STEEB.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.562
[cheers and applause]

03:33.120 --> 03:36.499
CIAO! CIAO!

03:36.530 --> 03:38.566
[cheers and applause]

03:43.540 --> 03:45.201
[thick eastern European accent]
DO NOT WORRY.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.583
I WILL, UH,
RAISE THIS MYSELF.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.848
I'M ONLY THE HEAD
OF THE COMPANY,

03:49.890 --> 03:53.758
AND AFTER DOING
ALL THE DESIGN WORK MYSELF,

03:53.800 --> 03:56.189
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO SOME MENIAL WORK.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.537
[electricity crackling]

03:57.570 --> 03:59.709
[alarmed cries and screams]

04:03.320 --> 04:06.517
(woman)
GREGOR! GREGOR!

04:06.560 --> 04:10.223
[alarmed cries continue]

04:10.260 --> 04:11.591
GREGOR!
GREGOR!

04:11.630 --> 04:12.790
YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE

04:12.830 --> 04:16.300
YOU DON'T WANT
TO WORK TONIGHT?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.547
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:18.580 --> 04:19.877
*

04:19.910 --> 04:22.014
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:22.050 --> 04:23.312
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

04:23.350 --> 04:25.250
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:25.290 --> 04:26.951
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:27.000 --> 04:29.195
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:29.230 --> 04:30.663
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:30.700 --> 04:31.906
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:31.940 --> 04:34.579
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

04:34.610 --> 04:37.613
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

04:46.170 --> 04:48.138
YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU MODEL?

04:48.170 --> 04:50.206
WHAT,
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.140
WHAT, ME AND MY BRO HERE
AREN'T WORTHY

04:52.180 --> 04:54.148
OF LEERING
INTO A LITTLE CAMERA LENS

04:54.180 --> 04:56.216
OR BLUE-STEELING IT UP
OCCASIONALLY?

04:56.250 --> 04:57.911
[European accent]
YOUR BRO, OF COURSE.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.279
HIS FEATURES ARE
IMMACULATE.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.719
BUT YOU...
NOT SO MUCH.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.260
WHAT?

05:03.300 --> 05:04.665
WHAT ARE YOU, INSANE?!

05:04.700 --> 05:06.907
HELP--HELP ME OUT HERE, TAN.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.929
HE'S A FOOT MODEL.

05:07.980 --> 05:09.675
OH, WELL,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.268
REALLY,
THANKS FOR THAT.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.685
HE'S LYING.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.156
IT WAS FOOT AND...
ANKLE.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.819
(Shawn)
AND I DID SOME HAND WORK,
OKAY?

05:19.870 --> 05:21.906
PERHAPS YOU RECOGNIZE THIS...

05:21.940 --> 05:24.977
FROM THE INSURANCE COMMERCIALS.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.012
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
WANT TO COME?

05:27.050 --> 05:29.883
OKAY.
CIAO.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.251
SHE SEEMS SO BORED.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.450
SO LONELY.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.822
(Shawn)
YEAH, BUT SO DOES
EVERYBODY HERE, DUDE.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.134
DID YOU NOTICE THAT
THE MIKE STAND WAS SET TOO LOW

05:37.170 --> 05:38.762
WHEN GREGOR CAME OUT
ON THE STAGE?

05:38.810 --> 05:40.402
WHY WOULD THE MIKE STAND
BE SET SO LOW

05:40.440 --> 05:42.078
WHEN HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO WAS GONNA SPEAK TONIGHT?

05:42.110 --> 05:43.145
DO YOU SEE THE CLOCK?

05:43.180 --> 05:44.738
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF WE STUMBLE
UPON SOMETHING HUGE?

05:44.790 --> 05:45.939
WHAT DOES THE CLOCK SAY,
SHAWN?

05:45.990 --> 05:48.959
FINE. NEVER MIND.
THANK YOU.

05:48.990 --> 05:51.254
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
NO WORK, GOT IT.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.892
ALL RIGHT, YOU WILL EACH,
ONE BY ONE,

05:52.930 --> 05:54.363
GO TO THE AREA
I'VE SEQUESTERED,

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
STATE THE NAME OF THE AGENCY
YOU WORK FOR AND--

05:56.840 --> 05:58.478
WHY AM I SURPRISED?

05:58.510 --> 06:00.717
USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE--
JUST TELL ME
IF YOU'VE SEEN ANYTHING.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.085
MAYBE.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.156
DO YOU SUSPECT FOUL PLAY?
NOT REALLY.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.953
THERE'S NO ONE HERE
WITH AN IQ OVER 40.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.458
SO YOU'RE ASKING
FOR OUR HELP.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.967
[loud stomp]

06:10.000 --> 06:11.900
[Shawn in pain]
NEVER MIND.

06:11.940 --> 06:13.874
UH, WE'RE NOT AVAILABLE
TONIGHT.

06:13.910 --> 06:16.811
[clears throat]
WIDE OPEN TOMORROW, THOUGH.

06:16.850 --> 06:17.919
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT, SHAWN?

06:17.950 --> 06:19.884
LOOK, MY DAD INSISTED
I RETURN THESE BY 8:00 AM.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.852
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

06:20.890 --> 06:22.983
I PLAN ON SLEEPING IN
TILL AT LEAST NOON.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.258
ESPECIALLY AFI'ER WE HOWL
ALL NIGHT.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.267
WHOA.
[laughter]

06:25.300 --> 06:27.791
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
IN THERE.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.933
NO, THAT CAN'T BE.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.272
DUDE, IT'S 10:43.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.083
HE'S EASILY BEEN ASLEEP
FOR TWO HOURS.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.179
NO, I THINK IT'S A WOMAN.
LISTEN.

06:38.220 --> 06:41.428
(woman)
SEE THERE IS SOMEONE HERE.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.495
MR. SPENCER.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.862
UH, HOW UNEXPECTED.

06:45.910 --> 06:47.969
CHIEF?

06:48.010 --> 06:50.171
UH...I JUST CAME BY

06:50.210 --> 06:52.314
TO LEAVE THESE HALF BOOTS
ON THE DOOR MAT.

06:52.350 --> 06:55.023
I--I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

06:57.430 --> 07:00.433
OH, MR. SPENCER,
PLEASE COME IN.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.631
COME IN.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.309
MR. GUSTER.

07:05.350 --> 07:09.286
I JUST THOUGHT I'D BRING
MY DEAR FRIEND SUSAN OVER

07:09.320 --> 07:10.389
TO MEET YOUR FATHER.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.479
SHE'S A LOVELY,
SINGLE WOMAN

07:12.530 --> 07:14.225
WHO WORKS AT CITY HALL.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.569
OH...

07:16.600 --> 07:18.033
[cell phone ringing]

07:18.070 --> 07:21.972
OH, EXCUSE ME.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.240
O'HARA,
THIS BETI'ER BE BIG.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.248
YOU'RE STILL AT CIAO?

07:28.420 --> 07:29.387
OKAY.

07:29.430 --> 07:30.954
WELL, THIS CASE
JUST CHANGED.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.967
[whispering]
DUDE...

07:32.000 --> 07:33.627
I WILL KILL YOU, SHAWN.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.739
EWW.

07:34.770 --> 07:37.136
ALL RIGHT, GET ANY POTENTIALS
DOWN TO THE STATION.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.374
I AM ON MY WAY.

07:38.410 --> 07:40.048
YOU BE OKAY?
YES.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.547
OKAY. BYE.
BYE.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.319
BYE, HENRY.
THANK YOU.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.658
WHOA.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.385
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:46.430 --> 07:48.091
WELL, WE DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS LADIES NIGHT

07:48.130 --> 07:49.062
AT CLUB HENRY.

07:49.100 --> 07:53.139
SO I DROPPED BY
TO RETURN YOUR HALF BOOTS.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.547
WOW, HENRY, THAT'S SOME
WILD-LOOKING FOOTWEAR.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.172
YEAH, UH...

07:57.220 --> 07:58.676
SUSAN, THIS
IS MY SON SHAWN

07:58.720 --> 08:00.347
AND, UH, GUS.

08:00.390 --> 08:00.958
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.224
OH, YOU CAN CALL ME SUE.

08:03.260 --> 08:04.693
MOST PEOPLE CALL ME
SUE B.

08:04.730 --> 08:08.166
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO SUES
AT THE OFFICE.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.079
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT REALLY
A FACTOR HERE.

08:12.110 --> 08:14.340
UH...SHAWN,

08:14.380 --> 08:19.420
COULD YOU HELP ME
IN THE KITCHEN WITH THESE?

08:19.460 --> 08:22.122
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.205
SO...

08:27.240 --> 08:29.242
HEARD ABOUT PLUTO?

08:29.280 --> 08:30.508
THAT'S MESSED UP.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.279
YEAH.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.208
[nervous chuckles]

08:36.130 --> 08:37.757
REALLY, DAD?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.427
CHEESE CUBES AND WIENERS?

08:39.470 --> 08:40.459
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.764
IS THIS SOME SORT
OF BLIND DATE?

08:42.810 --> 08:45.301
SORT OF.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.376
SHE'S JUST...

08:47.420 --> 08:50.082
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
NONDESCRIPT.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.052
"NONDESCRIPT"?

08:51.090 --> 08:53.149
I'VE NEVER HEARD A WOMAN
DESCRIBED LIKE THAT

08:53.190 --> 08:54.657
UNLESS SHE WAS
A ROBBERY SUSPECT.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.224
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, SHE'S PRETI'Y.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.261
SHE'S A LITTLE BORING
AND PRIM.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.267
I CUBED THESE MYSELF.

08:59.310 --> 09:01.073
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TRY ONE.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.240
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.441
I HAVE NO OPINION
OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.447
OH, SHAWN, COME ON.

09:05.490 --> 09:06.445
YOU HAVE AN OPINION
ON EVERYTHING.

09:06.490 --> 09:07.354
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO WOMEN.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.551
JUST GIVE ME
YOUR FIRSLéMPRESSION.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.592
WHY NOT?

09:11.630 --> 09:12.858
YOU HAVE TO GET
OVER THIS.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.697
NOBODY WANTS
TO GROW OLD ALONE.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.469
MAYBE A NICE LADY
WILL HELP HIM RELAX A LITTLE.

09:16.510 --> 09:18.569
NEW SUBJECT, GUS.

09:18.610 --> 09:20.441
DID YOU SEE THE CHIEF
RUN OUT OF THERE? HUH?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.289
MUST BE SOMETHING BIG.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.241
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

09:23.290 --> 09:25.281
THERE'S ONLY 73 MINUTES LEFI'
IN YOUR BIRTHDAY.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.719
ACTUALLY, 72 MINUTES.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.193
NOT UNTIL MIDNIGHT,
SHAWN.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.925
I'M CINDERELLA,
AND THIS IS MY BALL.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.994
AND I'M NOT LIFI'ING
A FINGER

09:31.040 --> 09:33.565
UNTIL MY CARRIAGE TURNS
INTO A BIG-ASS PUMPKIN.

09:33.610 --> 09:35.248
GOT IT?
GOT IT.
GOOD.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.441
[video game noises]

09:40.620 --> 09:42.929
[slurping]

09:42.960 --> 09:44.723
[slurping]

09:44.760 --> 09:45.761
THANK YOU.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.930
[ticking loudly]

09:56.550 --> 09:59.383
(Juliet)
OKAY, WHERE DO YOU WANT
ALL THESE PEOPLE?

09:59.430 --> 10:00.897
JUST PUT 'EM IN
BOTH INTERROGATION ROOMS

10:00.930 --> 10:01.191
AND WE'LL ROVE IT.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.328
LET'S GO, GO, GO!

10:09.550 --> 10:11.279
SO THE ELECTRICAL CABLE
OFFSTAGE

10:11.320 --> 10:13.515
WAS DELIBERATELY SEVERED.

10:13.550 --> 10:14.915
THE CHIEF THINKS
IT WAS DONE PRO.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.825
THAT MEANS...

10:16.860 --> 10:19.761
OH! 6-5.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.463
[ticking loudly]

10:23.510 --> 10:26.308
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHERE YOU WERE THIS AFTERNOON?

10:26.350 --> 10:27.510
IT WAS YELLOW.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.518
AND BORING.

10:29.550 --> 10:32.018
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A RESTAURANT?

10:32.060 --> 10:33.891
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

10:33.930 --> 10:37.798
JUST WRITE DOWN
THAT IT WAS LAME.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.536
I DO LIKE THAT JACKET.

10:40.570 --> 10:41.605
REALLY?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.370
SOMEWHERE A TRANSIENT
IS SHIVERING IN THE NIGHT.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.741

[boom]

11:06.990 --> 11:09.424
FINE, TELL ME
WHAT YOU GOT.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.109
(Shawn)
HOW'S IT GOING,
CRIME FIGHTERS?

11:15.140 --> 11:17.005
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
VERY FORTHCOMING...OR BRIGHT.

11:17.050 --> 11:18.574
ONE OF THEM CANNOT CONFIRM
THE CORRECT SPELLING

11:18.620 --> 11:20.087
OF HIS OWN NAME.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.678
DID YOU BY CHANCE INTERVIEW
A MODEL NAMED BERLINDA?

11:21.730 --> 11:22.958
IS SHE STILL AROUND?

11:22.990 --> 11:24.025
GUS, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.459
I KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE

11:25.500 --> 11:26.524
TO OFFER OUR SERVICES.

11:26.570 --> 11:27.889
I'D RATHER SHOWER
WITH A BEAR.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.101
LOOK, THEY'RE ONLY GONNA TALK
TO THEIR OWN KIND.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.471
OKAY?

11:31.510 --> 11:33.705
SHALLOW, JUDGMENTAL,
CRUEL, AND GORGEOUS.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.876
WE'RE ALREADY EMBEDDED.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.718
UH-HUH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"EMBEDDED"?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.057
CHIEF, WE MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE USED DECEPTION

11:39.090 --> 11:40.125
TO GET INTO THE PARTY
TONIGHT.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.696
SEE YOU AT SWIMWEAR
WEDNESDAY.

11:41.730 --> 11:42.697
DON'T LET 'EM
SCARE YOU, TAN.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.732
HE'S TAN.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.034
RIGHT.

11:47.080 --> 11:47.933
THEY THINK WE'RE MODELS.

11:47.980 --> 11:48.674
THEY THINK I'M A MODEL.
ME TOO.

11:48.710 --> 11:51.440
A FOOT MODEL.
AND ANKLE, GUS!

11:51.480 --> 11:53.084
DUDE, THAT'S
JUST RIDICULOUS ANYWAY.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.054
EVERYBODY LOOK AT MY JAW.

11:56.490 --> 11:58.799
OH, WELL, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
YOU'RE HIRED.

11:58.830 --> 11:59.967
WHAT?!
HIRED.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.433
YOU CAN LOOK THE WORD UP.
CHANGE THAT TIE, DETECTIVE.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.170
NOW, MR. SPENCER,

12:04.210 --> 12:05.939
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT,
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU PRIVATELY.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.141
OF COURSE, CHIEF.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.117
CIAOBELLA AND GREGOR
ARE HOMEGROWN CELEBRITIES.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.889
THE LOCAL MEDIA IS
SHARPENING ITS PENCILS

12:13.930 --> 12:14.919
ON THIS ONE.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.927
AND THAT IS NOT
THE KIND OF PRESS

12:15.970 --> 12:19.007
THAT THIS DEPARTMENT
OR ITS INTERIM CHIEF NEEDS.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.007
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.678
CLEAR AS A CRYSTAL BALL.
GOOD.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.803
SO TELL ME...

12:23.850 --> 12:26.080
DID YOUR FATHER SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY FRIEND SUSAN?

12:31.300 --> 12:32.597
(Gus)
THEY ALL LIVE HERE?

12:32.630 --> 12:34.530
WELL, GREGOR OWNS
THE BUILDING.

12:34.570 --> 12:36.561
THE CIAO STUDIO'S
ACROSS THE STREET.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.931
HE USES THIS LOFT
FOR HIS PRIME MODELS.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.208
I WONDER IF IT LOOKS LIKE
THE LOFT

12:40.250 --> 12:41.069
IN HEAD OVER HEELS.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.715
YOU, AND ONLY YOU,
CAN CONFIRM THAT.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.887
MY HUSBAND'S FUNERAL IS TOMORROW
AT 12:25.

12:46.930 --> 12:49.922
BE THERE NO LATER
THAN...1:15.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.234
AND I'LL HAVE TO APPROVE
WHATEVER YOU'RE WEARING.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.830
NOW, OBVIOUSLY,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE

12:54.880 --> 12:56.745
BUT TO CONTINUE WITH
THE FALL LINE UNVEILING

12:56.780 --> 12:57.769
ON WEDNESDAY.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.969
MA'AM, BEFORE WE MOVE ON,

12:59.020 --> 13:01.056
SHOULD I HIRE SOMEONE
TO DO MAGNOLIAS

13:01.090 --> 13:02.955
TOMORROW
FOR THE SERVICE?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.855
WELL, OF COURSE
HIRE SOMEONE, EMILY!

13:04.900 --> 13:07.334
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY GROW
ON TREES.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.769
THAT MARRIAGE ALWAYS
SEEMED WEIRD TO ME.

13:12.810 --> 13:14.869
LIKE WHEN LIZA MINNELLI MARRIED
DAVID GEST.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.841
YEAH, WELL,

13:15.890 --> 13:19.257
CIAOBELLA AND GREGOR LASTED
EIGHT YEARS, GUS.

13:19.290 --> 13:23.090
I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THOSE
MARBLE-CHISELED SIMPLETONS

13:23.130 --> 13:24.392
ARE MORE DEVIOUS
THAN THEY LET ON.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.034
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DIG DEEP AND BLEND IN

13:26.070 --> 13:27.230
IN ORDER TO GET
REAL ANSWERS.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.272
DUDE, YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TROUBLE BLENDING IN?

13:30.310 --> 13:34.155
I HAVE THIS SHIRT, THIS SHIRT.
MOST OF THESE SHIRTS.

13:34.190 --> 13:37.125
AND TH ESE ARE
MY EXACT KENNETH COLES.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.323
AND THAT PICTURE OF MY MOM
PARASAILING IN MONTEGO BAY--

13:40.370 --> 13:41.962
YOU MOVED ME IN?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.706
DUDE, WE GOT LUCKY.
THEY JUST THREW SOME GUY OUT.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.140
NOW WE CAN LIVE IT UP CHIC
WHILE WE CATCH A KILLER.

13:46.180 --> 13:46.942
NOW HELP ME SET UP
MY CLAPPER.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.379
I'M NOT MOVING IN HERE,
SHAWN.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.082
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY SECRETS
WE UNCOVER.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.122
SHOWER'S FREE.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.163

OH, YOU MUST BE SIGRID.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.717
WHAT IS THAT, COSSACK?
DIE.

14:07.350 --> 14:08.385
YOU CAN QUESTION HER.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.059
YOU KNOW WHO
I'M QUESTIONING.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.453
WHAT'S UP, ROOMIES?

14:12.500 --> 14:14.388
INITIATION.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.328
THAT'S WHAT.
PUT 'EM UP.

14:16.370 --> 14:17.928
I'M ALLERGIC TO PILLOWS.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.402

14:21.180 --> 14:23.148
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT...

14:28.260 --> 14:30.296

IT WOULD REALLY
BEHOOVE YOU GUYS

14:30.330 --> 14:31.433
TO GET OUR NAMES RIGHT
IN THE FUTURE.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.079
OH, GOOD.
BERLINDA, YOU'RE HERE.

14:35.110 --> 14:37.010

OUT OF THE LOOP.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.090
MAYBE WE CAN PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.461
ACTUALLY, WE WERE THINKING
ABOUT MAYBE GOING TO A BAR,

14:46.500 --> 14:48.388
DOING SOME 02.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.338
COULDN'T WE DO THAT
AFTER WE TALK?

14:49.370 --> 14:51.577
BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

14:51.610 --> 14:53.305
I COULD BE READY
IN THREE MINUTES.

FOR 15 YEARS.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.037
YOU'RE NOT HARD TO FIND.

15:40.070 --> 15:43.073
WAS THAT GUY WEARING
A BRA?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.145
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
SO IMPORTANT

15:44.180 --> 15:45.147
THAT YOU'RE HERE
RIGHT NOW?

15:45.180 --> 15:46.112
IT'S KAREN'S FRIEND SUSAN.

15:46.150 --> 15:49.256
SHE CALLED AGAIN.
TWICE IN THE LAST TWO DAYS.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.951
DOESN'T THAT REEK
OF DESPERATION?

15:51.000 --> 15:51.967
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.989
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

IN HORROR.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.977
NOW, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
FOR ONE MORE SECOND

SHOWN THEM TO ANYONE BEFORE.

WHY NOT?

17:59.220 --> 18:01.211
I'D TOTALLY WEAR THESE.

VERY CONFUSED.

LET GREGOR AND CIAOBELLA

I'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO WORK.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.559
OKAY.

18:26.610 --> 18:28.771
WILL I SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT THE FUNERAL?

18:28.810 --> 18:30.744
YES, DEFINITELY.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.668
I'M--YEAH.
I THINK SO, YEAH.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.814
WELL...UM...GOOD.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.767
DON'T WORK TOO HARD.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.769
[bluesy music]

18:42.810 --> 18:49.784
*

18:49.820 --> 18:51.754
[Gus' voice on machine]
HI, YOU'VE REACHED
BURTON GUSTER

18:51.790 --> 18:53.519
WITH CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.596
LEAVE ME A MESSAGE
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

18:55.630 --> 18:56.892
STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL, HUH?

18:56.930 --> 18:58.568
THAT'S HOW WE'RE DOING IT NOW?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.329
ONE MODERATELY HOT CHICK
COMES BY,

19:00.370 --> 19:01.530
AND SUDDENLY I'M INVISIBLE?

19:01.580 --> 19:02.274
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUS?
THAT'S FINE.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.703
I'M TAKING THE BUNK
NEXT TO THE WINDOW.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.945
AND DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF YOUR PILLOW SMELLS FAINTLY

19:06.990 --> 19:09.652
OF MY BUTT.

19:34.610 --> 19:35.736
WHAT IS THIS?

19:35.780 --> 19:37.077
DID YOU GUYS GET UP
AT DAWN?

19:37.110 --> 19:38.771
DUDE, YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME
A LITTLE SHAKE?

19:38.820 --> 19:40.117
WE GOT UP
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.057
SIGRID, WE CAN ALL
GO TOGETHER.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.751
I WOULD RATHER EAT
MY OWN EARLOBES

19:45.800 --> 19:49.930
THAN SPEND ANOTHER HOUR
WITH YOU CALLOUS MONSTERS.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.574
THAT GIRL'S ACTING
LIKE A FREAK.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.515
[Shawn clears his throat loudly]

20:02.400 --> 20:04.163
DID YOU ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
LAST NIGHT

20:04.200 --> 20:05.997
BESIDES SELLING ME OUT
FOR VACANT HEAD?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.598
YES, I DID.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.801
I FOUND OUT THAT BERLINDA
ALWAYS WANTED

20:09.840 --> 20:11.819
A PET DWARF BUNNY
AS A CHILD.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.818
AND SHE LOVES ANYTHING
THAT SMELLS AND LOOKS

20:13.850 --> 20:15.158
LIKE LAVENDER.
SWEET.

20:15.190 --> 20:17.556
LET'S CALL THE CHIEF
AND GET PAID.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.126
I ALSO FOUND OUT
THAT CIAOBELLA WAS

20:19.160 --> 20:20.263
GRILLING ALL OF THE MODELS

20:20.300 --> 20:21.961
BECAUSE SHE WAS CONVINCED
THAT ONE OF THEM WAS SLEEPING

20:22.000 --> 20:22.967
WITH GREGOR.

20:23.010 --> 20:25.478
REALLY?

20:25.510 --> 20:26.977
YUP.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.910
WELL THAT COUPLED WITH THE FACT
THAT SHE'S DRUNK WITH POWER,

20:28.950 --> 20:30.611
TREATING HER SWEET
LITTLE ASSISTANT LIKE DIRT,

20:30.650 --> 20:34.222
GIVE US A PRETTY GOOD SUSPECT,
I'D SAY.

20:34.260 --> 20:35.921
LET'S CRASH A FUNERAL.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.870
OH, MY GOD.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.878
IS HE WEARING HUGO BOSS?

20:45.920 --> 20:47.683
WHAT A SELLOUT!

20:47.720 --> 20:50.052
SEE YOU NEVER.

20:50.090 --> 20:53.264
GOOD NIGHT FOREVER...
YOU BALD BASTARD.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.100
UH-HUH.
HOLD ON.

20:57.140 --> 21:01.941
IT WAS ME WHO PEED
IN THE HOT TUB.

21:01.980 --> 21:04.710
OKAY...

21:04.760 --> 21:07.649
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW,
UWE STEEB.

21:07.690 --> 21:08.793
REMEMBER THAT.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.859
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT DUDE.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.332
I'M IN CHARACTER,
SHAWN.

21:14.370 --> 21:16.304
BESIDES,
BERLIN DA'S LISTENING.

21:16.350 --> 21:18.079
SHUT UP.
[scoffs]

21:18.120 --> 21:19.269
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.185
I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU THIS.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.927
BERLINDA'S THE ONE THAT
COULDN'T SPELL HER OWN NAME.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.791
SO?

21:25.830 --> 21:28.765
YOU DON'T KNOW HER
LIKE I DO, SHAWN.

21:30.170 --> 21:31.068
DUDE!

21:31.110 --> 21:33.203
WHAT?
[whispering]
THAT WAS A LOVE NOTE.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.241
THAT'S A LOVE NOTE.
THAT'S A LOVE NOTE!

21:35.280 --> 21:36.781
SHE JUST HID A LOVE NOTE
IN THE CASKET.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.788
THAT MEANS SIGRID
WAS GREGOR'S MISTRESS.

21:38.820 --> 21:39.980
CIAOBELLA FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT AND KILLED HIM.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.226
I GOT IT!

21:41.260 --> 21:43.262
YOU CAN'T DANCE
AT A FUNERAL, SHAWN.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.858
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE
THE ARBITER OF GOOD TASTE?

21:44.900 --> 21:45.662
WE WAIT UNTIL IT'S OVER,

21:45.700 --> 21:47.236
AND WE DO IT
WITHOUT BLOWING MY COVER

21:47.270 --> 21:48.237
TO BERLINDA.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.679
SHE ONLY DATES MODELS.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.405
WOW.

21:51.450 --> 21:55.284
FINE, I'LL CALL JULES.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.392
[Ciaobella clears throat]

21:59.800 --> 22:02.064
WELL, THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING.

22:02.100 --> 22:05.934
WE GATHER TODAY
NOT TO MOURN THE PASSING

22:05.980 --> 22:09.279
OF MY DEAD HUSBAND--
HASSENFEFFER!

22:09.320 --> 22:13.859
BUT RATHER TO CELEBRATE
ALL THAT HE ONCE WAS.

22:13.890 --> 22:15.118
[sobbing loudly]

22:17.000 --> 22:22.302
WHILE I WILL ALWAYS MISS
GREGOR UWE STEEB--

22:22.340 --> 22:26.344
WHOSE REAL NAME WAS
GREGORY LAPSPANKSI--

22:26.380 --> 22:28.086
[loud sobs]

22:30.390 --> 22:32.426
I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL
NOT TO CRY...

22:32.460 --> 22:36.931
BUT TO DRINK AND LAUGH
AND DANCE

22:36.970 --> 22:40.178
AS WE REMEMBER A MAN
WHO ONCE THOUGHT

22:40.210 --> 22:42.349
A BELT MADE OF DRIED BITS
OF PANTHER

22:42.380 --> 22:43.347
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

22:43.390 --> 22:45.278
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.083
OH...

22:47.130 --> 22:50.918
GREGOR. ..

22:53.810 --> 22:57.177
SHE'S REALLY PLANTING ONE
ON HIM, HUH?

22:59.250 --> 23:01.457
MISS MASTERSON?

23:01.490 --> 23:02.752
CIAOBELLA?

23:02.760 --> 23:06.491
CIAOBELLA?

23:06.530 --> 23:08.361
AAH!

23:09.870 --> 23:12.100
[snaps photo]

23:15.380 --> 23:18.156
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.125
IT WASN'T THE WIFE.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.304
[loud honk]

23:27.340 --> 23:30.605
I LOVED GREGOR,
AND HE LOVED ME.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.413
BUT HE WASN'T GONNA LEAVE
HIS WIFE,

23:32.450 --> 23:34.247
AND YOU NEVER LEARNED TO SHARE
AS A CHILD,

23:34.290 --> 23:35.917
SO YOU WENT AHEAD
AND KILLED THEM BOTH.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.222
FOR SYMMETRY.

23:37.260 --> 23:38.488
SOUND ABOUT RIGHT?

23:38.530 --> 23:41.260
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.439
I MEAN, SURE,
IT WAS FRUSTRATING.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.438
I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HER

23:45.480 --> 23:46.708
WITHOUT HIM
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.914
HE WOULDN'T EVEN LET ME DRINK
OUT OF THE SAME GLASS AS HER.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.054
HE SAID THAT
COMPARING ME TO HER

23:52.090 --> 23:56.220
WAS LIKE COMPARING CLEOPATRA
TO MISS CLEO.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.364
YOU THINK BERLINDA'S
BACK AT THE LOFT?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.958
THAT ANALOGY
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

24:00.010 --> 24:01.204
IT WOULD IF YOU KNEW
WHO EITHER OF THEM WERE.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.300
BUT I WAS SHARING.

24:04.350 --> 24:06.170
I ACCEPTED IT.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.949
A PIECE OF HIM WAS ENOUGH.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.480
I MEAN, IT WAS THAT
OR NOTHING.

24:09.520 --> 24:14.924
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

24:14.970 --> 24:17.131
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNEW HOW

24:17.170 --> 24:18.569
TO ACCENTUATE
MY SHOULDERS

24:18.610 --> 24:21.579
TO MAKE MY WAIST
AND HIPS LOOK SMALLER.

24:21.610 --> 24:24.647
[sobbing]

24:24.690 --> 24:29.229
YOU...REALIZE YOU HAD MORE
MOTIVE THAN ANYONE, SIGRID.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.488
NO.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.634
NOW EMILY BLOOM HAS TAKEN OVER

24:32.670 --> 24:34.558
SOLE CREATIVE CONTROL
OF CIAO.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.475
I MEAN,
SHE INHERITS EVERYTHING.

24:36.510 --> 24:39.047
EMILY BLOOM?
WHO?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.047
THE MOUSY ASSISTANT?

24:40.090 --> 24:41.614
SHE STARTED
AS AN ASSISTANT.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.412
THAT'S JUST HOW
THEY TREATED HER.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.257
BUT SHE'S THIRD IN LINE.

24:45.290 --> 24:47.269
INTERESTING.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.234
SHE FAILED TO MENTION
THAT LITTLE FACTOID.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.703
IS THAT THE SAME SUIT--

24:50.740 --> 24:52.605
YES, OKAY? IT IS!

24:52.640 --> 24:54.073
I CAN GET MORE THAN
ONE WEARING OUT OF A SUIT

24:54.110 --> 24:55.304
IN A WORK WEEK.

24:55.350 --> 24:56.715
IT'S THE SAME TIE.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.786
GET OUT OF HERE!

24:58.820 --> 25:00.685
(Lassiter)
DON'T GO GETTING ANY IDEAS
ABOUT HOPPING A PLANE

25:00.730 --> 25:02.129
TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.526
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS
YET, MISSY.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.573
WHAT'S THE PLAN, STAN?
GO AWAY.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.441
THE REASON WE
BROUGHT YOU IN ON THIS CASE

25:13.490 --> 25:14.582
WAS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD
STOP DYING.

25:14.620 --> 25:16.258
O'HARA, GET DOWN TO CIAO.

25:16.290 --> 25:17.257
I WANT YOU TO PUT THE CLAMPS
ON MISS BLOOM,

25:17.290 --> 25:18.427
OUR LITTLE KIWI
LADDER CLIMBER.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.429
CHECK.

25:23.570 --> 25:26.607
(Emily)
THEN I WILL PAY THE PENALTY
TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.777
OH, WILLIAM,
WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE

25:28.820 --> 25:30.287
THOSE PLEATHER SAMPLES MAKE IT
TO ALICIA SILVERSTONE

25:30.320 --> 25:31.617
BEFORE 3:00.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.252
DON'T EVEN GIVE IT
ANOTHER THOUGHT.
MISS BLOOM...

25:33.290 --> 25:36.669
NO, A BUNNY DOES NOT NEED
TO GO BLIND IN ORDER TO CONFIRM

25:36.700 --> 25:39.635
THAT OUR BUYERS SHOULD NOT
EAT OUR CLOTHING.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.672
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF
I DOUSED YOUR RETINA IN HENNA,

25:41.710 --> 25:43.803
YOU CRO-MAGNON PIECE OF--
MISS BLOOM!

25:43.850 --> 25:45.215
I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA
FROM THE--

25:45.250 --> 25:47.514
OH, SCREW YOU!

25:47.550 --> 25:49.711
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE
THE CURVE, SAMANTHA.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.455
YOU KNOW, REAL WOMEN,
REAL FIGURES.

25:51.490 --> 25:54.220
JUST RAISE THE WAIST LINE.
MAKE IT AN "A" CUT.

25:54.270 --> 25:55.692
AND DON'T THINK
FOR ONE SECOND

25:55.740 --> 25:57.139
I DIDN'T NOTICE
YOUR NEW BANGS.

25:57.170 --> 25:58.137
YOU LOOK 21 AGAIN.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.171
MISS BLOOM, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.814
OH, AND WE'RE WALKING.

26:01.850 --> 26:03.112
WE BELIEVE THAT
BOTH YOUR PREDECESSORS

26:03.120 --> 26:04.712
WERE KILLED
BY THE SAME PERSON.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.456
AND NO ONE STOOD TO GAIN
MORE THAN I DID

26:06.490 --> 26:07.787
BY KILLING THEM BOTH?

26:07.830 --> 26:09.593
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU CAN SEE
WHERE THIS IS HEADED.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.767
I'LL NEED YOU TO ACCOUNT
FOR YOUR WHEREABOUTS--

26:10.800 --> 26:11.767
NOW IT'S JUST THE PROTOTYPE,

26:11.800 --> 26:13.836
BUT I'VE NEVER WANTED
TO BE A WOMAN THIS BADLY

26:13.870 --> 26:15.838
IN MY LIFE.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.507
OKAY.
CAN YOU TRY THESE ON?

26:17.550 --> 26:20.644
OH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

26:20.690 --> 26:23.557
WAIT--EXCUSE ME!
WHAT--

26:23.590 --> 26:25.922
OH.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.325
OH, WOW.

26:27.370 --> 26:30.760
[chuckling]

26:30.810 --> 26:31.799
WOW.

26:33.780 --> 26:36.248
TH ESE ARE FABULOUS.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.679
[applause]

26:37.720 --> 26:41.258
NOW, ARE WE TALKING
IN YOUR OFFICE OR MINE?

26:41.290 --> 26:43.360
OKAY, BACK TO WORK,
EVERYBODY.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.664
WILLIAM, ORDER PIZZA
FOR EVERYBODY.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.837
THAT YUMMY PLACE
WITH THE SOY RICOTTA.

26:46.870 --> 26:49.236
THANK YOU.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.841
WELL, THIS IS MY OFFICE,
SO FIRE AWAY.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.541
YOU'VE BEEN HEAD OF THIS COMPANY
FOR SIX HOURS,

26:54.590 --> 26:57.718
AND YOU'VE CHANGED
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.593
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY PRESERVING
THE CIAO LEGACY.

27:00.630 --> 27:01.597
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE ALL THESE THINGS

27:01.630 --> 27:02.858
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.504
AND I'M TURNING
THE COMPANY GREEN.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.371
I'M ENDING ANIMAL TESTING.

27:06.410 --> 27:08.640
SUBSIDIZING PROCEEDS
TO HELP FIND A CURE

27:08.680 --> 27:09.942
FOR BREAST CANCER.

27:09.980 --> 27:13.325
DO ANY OF THOSE SOUND
LIKE BAD THINGS TO YOU?

27:13.360 --> 27:14.725
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT AN ALIBI.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.022
NO, IT ISN'T.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.893
AND WHAT'S MORE,
I DON'T THINK I HAVE ONE.

27:18.940 --> 27:21.534
I MEAN, I WAS WITH THEM
ALL DAY EVERY DAY.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.379
I SEE.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.401
WELL, I'M SURE YOU WON'T MIND
IF I HAVE A LOOK AROUND

27:25.450 --> 27:26.781
AND CHAT WITH A FEW
OF YOUR EMPLOYEES?

27:26.820 --> 27:29.880
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

27:29.920 --> 27:33.822
THAT'S IT, MISS BLOOM.

27:33.870 --> 27:34.928
DETECTIVE...

27:37.100 --> 27:42.072
OH. RIGHT.

27:42.110 --> 27:44.943
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
SUCH GREAT LINES.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.083
THERE'S NO REASON WHY
YOU CAN'T DRESS TO ARREST.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.054
IS THERE?

27:56.480 --> 27:59.142
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT EMILY BLOOM?

27:59.180 --> 28:00.647
WELL, SHE WROTE,

28:00.690 --> 28:02.385
ARE YOU THERE, GOD?
IT'S ME MARGARET,

28:02.420 --> 28:03.352
AND FRECKLE JUICE.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.385
I THINK THAT WAS JUDY BLOOM.

28:05.430 --> 28:07.091

28:10.140 --> 28:11.937
SHAWN, YOU'RE JUST UPSET

28:13.010 --> 28:14.079
I DON'T GET IT.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.145
EMILY BLOOM WAS THE
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY,

28:15.180 --> 28:17.944
YET SHE WAS RUNNING COFFEE

MR. SPENCER,

28:34.090 --> 28:35.455
A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION,

28:35.490 --> 28:36.889

28:37.990 --> 28:39.628
HAS YOUR FATHER LOST
HIS MIND?

28:39.660 --> 28:41.525
I MEAN, WHY HASN'T HE CALLED
MY FRIEND SUSAN BACK?

28:41.570 --> 28:43.060
HONESTLY,
HE SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.658
CHIEF, I
CANNOT GET INVOLVED

28:44.710 --> 28:47.178

[phone ringing]
(Susan)
OH, WELL, HE LEFT A MESSAGE.

SHOULD I TAKE HER
TO CRAB SHACK WILLIE'S

29:00.670 --> 29:01.432
OR THE THIRD WHARF?

29:01.470 --> 29:03.472
THOSE CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE REAL PLACES.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.268
[all talking at once]

29:07.320 --> 29:09.049
LOOK, DAD,
I'M REALLY BUSY, OKAY?

29:09.090 --> 29:10.921
DO NOT BRING YOUR PURSE
INTO THE RESTAURANT.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.995
SHAWN,
JUST PICK A RESTAURANT.

29:12.030 --> 29:13.190
LISTEN, I'M GONNA
CALL HIM BACK.

29:13.230 --> 29:15.619
OKAY, CALL ME LATER,

I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU SHOULD TAKE HER TO DINNER!

29:17.240 --> 29:18.537

29:18.580 --> 29:20.639
THAT'S HER.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.113

HE CALLED HER.

29:22.150 --> 29:24.141
NOW STOP MESSING AROUND
AND GO FIND ME A KILLER.

29:24.190 --> 29:25.953
GOOD-BYE.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.858
AM I DREAMING?

NOPE.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.107
I JUST LOOK THIS GOOD.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.109
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT I AM THE ONLY SANE PERSON

29:38.150 --> 29:40.209
IN THE UNIVERSE RIGHT NOW?

29:40.250 --> 29:42.115
QUESTION...
DO YOU THINK THIS SHIRT ENHANCES

29:42.160 --> 29:44.025
OR DETRACT S FROM MY TRAPS?

29:44.060 --> 29:47.894

29:47.930 --> 29:49.932

NOPE.

29:49.970 --> 29:53.906
THIS SHIRT WAS DESIGNED
BY GREGOR UWE STEEB, SHAWN.

29:53.950 --> 29:55.247
IT'S A PART
OF THE NEW FALL LINE.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.747
(Gregor)
I'M ONLY THE HEAD
OF THE COMPANY,

29:56.780 --> 29:59.886
AND AFTER DOING
ALL THE DESIGNS MYSELF...

29:59.920 --> 30:01.319
(Shawn)
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.429
(Emily)
THANK YOU.

30:02.460 --> 30:05.691
I'VE NEVER REALLY SHOWN THEM
TO ANYONE BEFORE.

30:05.740 --> 30:08.334
THAT IS NOT GREGOR'S DESIGN.

30:08.370 --> 30:09.837
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:09.880 --> 30:11.108
THEY'RE STEALING
HER DESIGNS.

30:11.150 --> 30:12.276
WHOSE?
EMILY'S.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.289
GREGOR SAID
HE PERSONALLY DESIGNED

30:14.320 --> 30:15.742
THE WHOLE NEW LINE.

30:15.790 --> 30:17.257
HE'S FULL OF IT.
THAT'S EMILY'S.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.724
I'VE SEEN IT.
THEY'RE ALL EMILY'S.

30:21.830 --> 30:24.298

PUT SOME PANTS ON?

30:35.430 --> 30:37.227
I'VE BEEN CRAVING MEAT
LATELY.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.135
WELL, IN THAT CASE
THE PRIME RIB IS EXCELLENT.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.229
B.Y.O.B.
HELP YOURSELF.

30:41.270 --> 30:44.046
NO, NO, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.308
IS IT HOT IN HERE?

30:45.350 --> 30:47.341
I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

30:47.390 --> 30:49.711
WHEW, THAT'S BETTER.
DON'T YOU THINK?

31:07.360 --> 31:10.329
[sexy music]

31:10.360 --> 31:19.075
*

31:27.970 --> 31:30.188
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
I AM A WOMAN, CHIEF.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.435
AND I AM CHOOSING
TO DRESS LIKE ONE.

31:32.470 --> 31:34.506
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, O'HARA.

31:34.550 --> 31:36.370
I PAID FOR IT MYSELF.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.513
I WAS FEELING GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF,

31:38.550 --> 31:40.518
IT WAS MY LUNCH BREAK AND--

31:40.560 --> 31:41.857
CARLTON, IS THAT
A NEW TIE?

31:41.890 --> 31:44.029
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.368
I TRUST THIS IS ALL
IN AID OF SOMETHING?

31:46.400 --> 31:47.503
YES, CHIEF.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.371
I SPENT THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON
AT CIAO,

31:49.410 --> 31:51.071
AND I AM CERTAIN
THAT EMILY BLOOM

31:51.110 --> 31:52.338
IS NOT OUR KILLER.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.484
I GRILLED HER,
SHE DIDN'T BREAK.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.556
NOT TO MENTION SHE HAS
OVER A DOZEN EMPLOYEES

31:56.590 --> 31:58.148
THAT WOULD TAKE A BULLET
FOR HER.

31:58.190 --> 31:59.896
SHE SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE IT
IN HER

31:59.930 --> 32:00.919
TO KILL SOMEBODY,

32:00.970 --> 32:01.937
MUCH LESS TWO SOMEBODIES.

32:01.970 --> 32:03.198
I'D BET THE FARM ON IT.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.504
I'M SENSING SOMETHING.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.508
GREGOR AND CIAOBELLA
WERE STEALING EMILY'S DESIGNS.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.313
STEALING THEM,

32:09.350 --> 32:10.169
PASSING THEM OFF
AS THEIR OWN.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.517
ALL THE WHILE TREATING HER
AS A PEON.

32:11.550 --> 32:13.188
THAT'S NOT A BAD START
FOR MOTIVE.

32:13.220 --> 32:16.292
TOXICOLOGY REPORT:
CIAOBELLA WAS POISONED.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.422
THE ONLY THING IN HER SYSTEM
WERE TRACES

32:17.460 --> 32:18.597
OF ARSENIC, SOY MILK,

32:18.630 --> 32:20.598
AND GREEN

32:26.680 --> 32:28.955

THE FARM.

TO BUTTER YOUR BISCUIT?

32:32.060 --> 32:33.652

32:39.980 --> 32:43.143
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING
FOR THE MAYOR?

32:43.180 --> 32:44.442
IT'S OKAY.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.458
IT'D BE MORE FUN
IF HE WASN'T MARRIED THOUGH.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.459
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE
BEING RETIRED?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.593

SO WHAT'S THE STORY?

32:51.630 --> 32:52.699
YOU TAKE A SLUG?

32:52.730 --> 32:56.632
OR DID YOU JUST GET TIRED
OF BEING GOOD ALL THE TIME?

32:56.680 --> 32:58.602
NOW BE HONEST...

32:58.650 --> 33:03.952
ISN'T THAT BETTER
THAN SOME FLAKY PIECE OF FISH?

33:03.960 --> 33:06.451
THAT'S GOOD.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.058

37:32.060 --> 37:34.255
UHH!

37:34.300 --> 37:37.098
CIAOBELLA MASTERSON
WAS MURDERED

37:37.140 --> 37:40.075
BY HER HUSBAND,
GREGOR UWE STEEB.

37:40.110 --> 37:41.805
(Lassiter)
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

37:41.850 --> 37:43.272
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.912
GREGOR WAS ALREADY DEAD.

37:44.950 --> 37:46.759
DO I COME DOWN
TO YOUR OFFICE

37:46.790 --> 37:47.916
AND BOTHER YOU
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.222
ALL THE TIME.

37:49.260 --> 37:51.592
THAT'S FAIR.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.230
GREGOR WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

37:59.350 --> 38:01.045
HE COULDN'T CHANCE
GE'ITING CAUGHT.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.980
NOT WITH HIS TENTH
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY APPROACHING.

38:03.020 --> 38:04.556
HE WAS DESPERATE
TO GET OUT OF THE MARRIAGE

38:04.560 --> 38:08.166
WITHOUT LOSING HALF
OF HIS COMPANY.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.660
SO HE POISONED CIAOBELLA'S
GREEN SUPERFOOD POWDER.

38:12.710 --> 38:15.247
ONLY SHE WOULDN'T DIE...

38:15.280 --> 38:18.169
BECAUSE SHE WAS BULIMIC.

38:18.220 --> 38:20.051
CIAOBELLA COULDN'T KEEP
ANYTHING SHE ATE DOWN.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.196
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK FOREVER
FOR THE POISON TO TAKE EFFECT.

38:23.230 --> 38:26.097
ALL GREGOR COULD DO
WAS WAIT...

38:26.130 --> 38:29.361
HE WOULDN'T EVEN LET ME DRINK
OUT OF THE SAME GLASS AS HER.

38:29.410 --> 38:31.139
AND KEEP
HIS VAMPIRE MISTRESS AWAY

38:31.180 --> 38:32.306
FROM THE POISONOUS ELEMENTS.

38:32.350 --> 38:34.079
[sobbing]

38:35.690 --> 38:36.759
BUT...CIAOBELLA KNEW
OF THE AFFAIR,

38:36.790 --> 38:41.329
AND HAD HERSELF
A MIND FOR MURDER.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.965
USING HER OWN SKILLS
WITH ELECTRICITY,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.104
SHE LAID A TRAP FOR GREGOR

38:46.140 --> 38:48.973
BEFORE HIS PLAN
WAS COMPLETE.

38:49.010 --> 38:50.910
WHAT'S UP?!

38:54.990 --> 38:57.220
(Lassiter)
WHAT ABOUT EMILY?

38:57.260 --> 38:59.091
EMILY WAS DRINKING
A SUPERFOOD SMOOTHIE

38:59.130 --> 39:00.688
THE DAY SHE TOOK OVER.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.776
REALLY, JULES?
YOU TOO?

39:02.810 --> 39:04.675
I'M SORRY.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.840
IS THIS JUST A FREE-FOR-ALL?

39:05.880 --> 39:07.245
ANYBODY CAN JUST BOUNCE IN
ANYTIME THEY WANT?

39:07.280 --> 39:09.089
I'M SORRY.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.985
IN SUMMATION,

39:11.020 --> 39:13.397
CIAOBELLA KILLED GREGOR.

39:13.430 --> 39:15.421
GREGOR KILLED CIAOBELLA.

39:15.470 --> 39:18.234
EMILY GOT CAUGHT
IN THE GREEN POWDERY CROSSFIRE.

39:18.270 --> 39:21.239
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE DESIGNED
THE NEW FALL LINE.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.874
IT'S REVOLUTIONARY,
BY THE WAY.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.184
WE ALL DESERVE
TO FEEL BEAUTIFUL.

39:26.220 --> 39:28.188
W-WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THESE?

39:28.230 --> 39:30.949
NOTHING.
PUT 'EM AWAY.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.436
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

39:34.470 --> 39:36.233
YOU'RE ALL FREE TO GO.

39:41.150 --> 39:42.378
THAT WAS CRAZY, RIGHT?

39:42.420 --> 39:44.058
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT
OVER THE PHONE.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.058
HELL, YOU COULD'VE PUT IT
IN AN EMAIL.

39:46.090 --> 39:47.990
COME ON.

39:48.030 --> 39:49.327
[scoffs]

39:49.370 --> 39:51.838
DUDE, DID YOU SEE THAT?

39:51.870 --> 39:53.007
THAT WAS, LIKE,
THE MOST STYLISH WRAP-UP EVER.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.543
EXCEPT FOR THE PART WHERE
THERE WAS NO ONE TO ACCUSE.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.140
BUT WHATEVER, RIGHT?
IT WAS HOT.

39:58.180 --> 40:00.159
GUS.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.125
GUS?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.835
ALL RIGHT, HERE I AM.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.438
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE PERRY COMO?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.345
THANKS FOR COMING, SON.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.472
YOU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.249
CLEARLY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT
AN OLD SPICE COMMERCIAL.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.588
THAT'S FUNNY.

40:18.630 --> 40:20.621
LOOK, SHAWN, I JUST--
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.127
YOU KNOW, FACE TO FACE.
I GOT IT.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.091
YOU'VE BEEN INVITED

40:24.670 --> 40:26.877
I'M GOING ON ANOTHER DATE
WITH SUSAN.

40:26.910 --> 40:30.118
WHAT, THE WOMAN
YOU DESCRIBED

40:30.150 --> 40:31.412
AS A CARNIVOROUS MINK?

40:31.450 --> 40:32.644
I'LL ADMIT
HER BEHAVIOR

40:32.690 --> 40:34.248
THREW ME A LITTLE
OFF BALANCE,

40:34.290 --> 40:37.919
BUT THE NIGHT ENDED UP
BEING A LOT OF FUN.

40:37.970 --> 40:40.894
OH, MY GOD.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.976
YOU HAVE A HICKEY!
SH-SHAWN--

40:43.010 --> 40:43.999
YOU CALLED ME OVER HERE
TO SHOW OFF YOUR HICKEY?!

40:44.040 --> 40:45.200
THAT'S SICK!

40:45.250 --> 40:46.945
SHAWN, NO!

40:46.980 --> 40:50.211
NO, I CALLED YOU
OVER HERE BECAUSE...

40:50.260 --> 40:53.320
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT MOVING ON WITH MY LIFE.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.691
YOUR MOTHER'S NOT
A PART OF IT ANYMORE.

40:54.730 --> 40:57.528
SHE HASN'T BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.
SHE IS NOT COMING BACK.

40:57.570 --> 40:58.639
AND I HOPE SHE'S HAPPY.

40:58.670 --> 40:59.637
YEAH...
I MEAN THAT.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.635
SHE DESERVES IT.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.477
BUT MY LIFE IS HERE, SHAWN.

41:02.510 --> 41:04.910
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
SNEAK AROUND TRYING TO LIVE IT.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.684
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW.
WELL, SHAWN, YOU HAVE TO.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.278
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO, OKAY?

41:09.330 --> 41:10.558
I DON'T CARE.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.363
I JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.595
SO DON'T CALL ME ON THE PHONE
ASKING ME FOR ADVICE.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.629
AND DON'T EXPECT ME
TO MEET YOU

41:15.670 --> 41:16.432
AND YOUR NEW DOMINATRIX
GIRLFRIEND FOR DINNER.

41:16.470 --> 41:19.974
KID, THIS IS NOT EASY
FOR ME EITHER.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.443
YEAH, IT NEVER WAS.

41:22.490 --> 41:25.357
HAVE A NICE DATE.

41:29.230 --> 41:32.028
[bangs on wall]

41:32.070 --> 41:33.628
AND UNLESS YOU PLAN ON
TAKING HER TO WAYNE MANOR,

41:33.680 --> 41:35.545
LOSE THE TURTLENECK, OKAY?

41:35.580 --> 41:37.013
LET HER ADMIRE
HER WORK.

41:37.050 --> 41:39.018
AND REMEMBER,
YOU TREAT A WOMAN

41:39.050 --> 41:40.381
LIKE A PERSON,
AND THEN A PRINCESS,

41:40.420 --> 41:42.354
AND THEN A GREEK GODDESS--

41:42.390 --> 41:44.620
AND THEN A PERSON AGAIN.

41:47.370 --> 41:50.009
RIGHT.

41:52.810 --> 41:55.643
OKAY.
