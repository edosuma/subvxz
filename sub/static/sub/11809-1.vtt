00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
<i>July 1 2.</i>

00:47.010 --> 00:51.880
<i>I wonder why it was that long ago
I became a watcher of things.</i>

00:51.950 --> 00:56.750
<i>Always watching others do and feel things
I wouldn't or couldn't do myself.</i>

00:58.520 --> 01:03.790
<i>Always standing off at a distance,
isolated, detached.</i>

01:05.690 --> 01:09.460
<i>I envy the wolves
for how they experience the world.</i>

01:09.530 --> 01:12.130
<i>Always in such direct contact
with their environment,</i>

01:12.200 --> 01:14.190
<i>traveling through their territories,</i>

01:14.270 --> 01:18.870
<i>alert and attuned to all the signs
coming in through their senses,</i>

01:18.940 --> 01:23.170
<i>telling them where a rabbit
recently passed or the sweet water lay,</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:27.770
<i>revealing a whole universe to them
that we can never really know.</i>

01:31.820 --> 01:37.520
<i>But I sit behind glass lenses,
filling up notebooks and triplicate forms,</i>

01:37.590 --> 01:42.890
<i>trying to capture the wolves
within the pages of my journal.</i>

01:42.960 --> 01:46.560
<i>And what'll be done with the study
when I'm finished?</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:50.440
<i>Once these wolves
have been exposed to my world. . .</i>

01:51.170 --> 01:54.010
<i>what will happen to them ?</i>

02:13.360 --> 02:17.390
<i>There's a strange wolf
that I only see fleetingly.</i>

02:18.970 --> 02:23.060
<i>He must be part of the pack,
but an outsider,</i>

02:23.140 --> 02:25.800
<i>always following at a distance.</i>

02:27.240 --> 02:29.900
<i>Perhaps another watcher.</i>

03:42.420 --> 03:45.050
<i>(high-pitched bird call)</i>

03:45.120 --> 03:47.110
Oh!

04:17.550 --> 04:20.519
<i>Ootek thought you might need
some company,</i>

04:21.860 --> 04:23.450
Ootek?

04:27.830 --> 04:29.820
<i>Hello,</i>

04:44.550 --> 04:47.240
<i>Really can't tell you how glad I am
to see the two of you,</i>

04:47.320 --> 04:50.980
<i>It's been so long
since I heard another human voice,</i>

04:51.590 --> 04:53.920
You have any ketchup here?

04:54.660 --> 04:58.590
<i>No, I don't, I'm sorry,
I ran out a couple of weeks ago,</i>

04:58.660 --> 05:01.150
<i>Here, have some fish,</i>

05:03.500 --> 05:05.360
<i>Uh, no,</i>

05:05.430 --> 05:07.920
<i>No, thanks, I don't eat fish,</i>

05:10.740 --> 05:13.070
What do you eat?

05:13.540 --> 05:15.530
<i>Actually,,,</i>

05:16.710 --> 05:18.870
<i>I eat mice,</i>

05:21.050 --> 05:24.350
<i>- You eat mice?
- Yeah,</i>

05:28.820 --> 05:31.310
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

05:33.730 --> 05:36.530
<i>It's an experiment, really,</i>

05:36.600 --> 05:40.360
<i>You see, the wolves are supposed to eat
caribou, However, there are no caribou,</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:42.960
<i>Basically, what the wolves
have been eating is mice,</i>

05:43.040 --> 05:47.740
So I'm conducting an experiment
to see whether a carnivore, a big animal,

05:47.810 --> 05:49.870
<i>can live on nothing but mice,</i>

05:49.940 --> 05:54.380
<i>So I've been just eating mice,
and I'm doing fine,</i>

05:58.150 --> 06:00.140
<i>(translates)</i>

06:18.370 --> 06:22.540
<i>- What does he say?
- He says, "Good idea,"</i>

06:26.750 --> 06:29.410
<i>(two men speak native language)</i>

06:33.250 --> 06:35.450
<i>(Tyler) Syringe,</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:37.510
<i>There,</i>

06:45.200 --> 06:49.660
<i>- What's that?
- Clamp, This thing? Yeah,</i>

06:49.740 --> 06:51.800
See the way this is set up here?

06:51.870 --> 06:55.470
<i>This is so it grabs ahold, You got him,</i>

06:55.540 --> 06:57.530
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

06:58.710 --> 07:00.940
<i>It's a gripper,</i>

07:01.020 --> 07:03.250
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

07:03.320 --> 07:05.910
<i>I know what that is,
They had them at the mines,</i>

07:05.990 --> 07:10.520
<i>Yeah, that's right, It's a gas mask,
except that I use it for wolf scats,</i>

07:10.590 --> 07:16.000
<i>The wolf scat has little tiny animals,
little tiny parasites,</i>

07:16.060 --> 07:19.590
And if you breathe these things in,
you breathe these little guys,

07:19.670 --> 07:24.260
<i>they go up into your brain
and they eat it out,</i>

07:24.340 --> 07:26.710
Scat? What is scat?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.730
<i>Uh,,,</i>

07:28.810 --> 07:30.870
<i>Wolf droppings,</i>

07:30.950 --> 07:35.140
See, the idea behind this is
if you study what comes out of a wolf,

07:35.220 --> 07:38.580
<i>you get a pretty good idea what went in,</i>

07:38.650 --> 07:40.480
<i>Hmm,</i>

07:40.560 --> 07:44.620
<i>I got a whole bag of them down there,
I got a whole sack,</i>

07:44.690 --> 07:46.680
<i>(translates)</i>

07:54.600 --> 07:56.930
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

08:00.780 --> 08:02.770
What did he say?

08:02.840 --> 08:05.570
<i>He says, "Good idea,"</i>

08:25.800 --> 08:27.790
<i>(howling)</i>

08:36.340 --> 08:38.340
<i>(howling continues)</i>

08:45.520 --> 08:47.850
<i>(speak native language)</i>

08:59.600 --> 09:03.470
<i>And so they settled in with me,
as if nothing could be more natural.</i>

09:07.840 --> 09:11.280
<i>For my part,
I'm glad to have the company.</i>

09:11.350 --> 09:13.340
<i>A seven,</i>

09:17.250 --> 09:19.240
<i>Mike had gone to school in the south.</i>

09:19.320 --> 09:21.720
<i>When his parents died,
Ootek adopted him.</i>

09:21.790 --> 09:25.750
<i>Traditionally, they are no orphans
among the Inuit.</i>

09:25.830 --> 09:28.320
<i>(plays stilted tune)</i>

09:39.470 --> 09:42.670
I met a girl in a bar,

09:42.740 --> 09:45.870
<i>and she wanted me to buy her drinks,
so I bought her some,</i>

09:45.950 --> 09:50.280
<i>And then after a while,
she wanted to come home with me,</i>

09:50.350 --> 09:54.450
<i>But I made a mistake,</i>

09:54.520 --> 09:57.180
<i>I smiled at her,</i>

09:57.960 --> 10:02.560
<i>That's what happens when a meat eater
becomes a sugar eater,</i>

10:17.080 --> 10:20.280
<i>Ootek has taken
a particular interest in the study,</i>

10:20.350 --> 10:26.780
<i>though I've learned there is little about
wolves that he doesn 't already know.</i>

10:33.290 --> 10:36.060
<i>But I sense there is another side to Ootek,</i>

10:36.130 --> 10:39.070
<i>some part of his nature
that he hasn 't shown.</i>

10:39.130 --> 10:41.290
<i>I try not to annoy him
with too many questions,</i>

10:41.370 --> 10:44.740
<i>but there are many things I'd like to know.</i>

11:10.930 --> 11:13.260
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

11:18.740 --> 11:22.510
<i>When he was young
he used to follow the wolves on their hunts,</i>

11:23.910 --> 11:26.240
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

11:29.180 --> 11:32.880
<i>The wolf is his helping spirit: amarok.</i>

11:35.720 --> 11:38.560
<i>- Ama...
- Amarok.</i>

11:38.630 --> 11:40.620
<i>- Ama...
- The wolf,</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:43.190
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

11:54.010 --> 11:59.310
<i>He went 30 days without food
and without protection from the cold,</i>

12:06.520 --> 12:09.010
<i>Then he saw the wolf,</i>

12:16.560 --> 12:20.560
<i>He felt the wolf bite into his heart,</i>

12:27.140 --> 12:31.940
<i>When he woke up, he was all in one piece,</i>

12:33.850 --> 12:38.250
<i>That's how the wolf
became his helping spirit,</i>

12:50.670 --> 12:52.660
<i>(howling)</i>

13:42.450 --> 13:45.680
<i>I wonder what makes them howl like that,</i>

13:48.160 --> 13:51.150
<i>They howl when they're lonely,</i>

13:53.630 --> 13:56.120
<i>Or to call their friends,</i>

13:58.200 --> 14:02.690
<i>That way, the other,,,
the others will know where they are,</i>

14:02.770 --> 14:06.710
<i>and then sooner or later
they're bound to meet up,</i>

14:09.910 --> 14:14.070
<i>That's the way to catch wolves,
Go where they're howling,</i>

14:14.150 --> 14:17.120
Hide behind a rock,

14:17.180 --> 14:19.550
<i>and then howl like one of them,</i>

14:19.620 --> 14:24.060
<i>And then,,, they will come to investigate,</i>

14:26.730 --> 14:29.060
Yeah?

14:31.670 --> 14:35.000
<i>When they get close enough,
you shoot 'em,</i>

14:37.240 --> 14:40.330
<i>You shoot 'em,
Hopefully you hit 'em,</i>

14:46.550 --> 14:49.210
<i>That's how you kill a wolf,</i>

14:56.260 --> 14:59.490
<i>To me, wolves mean money,</i>

15:01.600 --> 15:04.220
<i>It's a way of making a living,</i>

15:06.930 --> 15:12.170
<i>One wolf pelt costs about $350,</i>

15:17.240 --> 15:19.680
And I'vegottofeed myfamily.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.740
<i>My children,</i>

15:23.050 --> 15:26.020
Buy a snowmobile,

15:26.090 --> 15:29.680
<i>food, rifle, bullets, whatever,</i>

15:35.300 --> 15:37.790
<i>You wouldn't,,,</i>

15:37.870 --> 15:40.530
I mean, you wouldn't kill these wolves?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.930
<i>These ones? Oh,</i>

15:44.240 --> 15:46.640
<i>No, I don't think so,</i>

15:46.710 --> 15:51.300
<i>Besides, you would get mad
if I killed one of them,</i>

15:51.380 --> 15:54.370
<i>And your gun is bigger than mine,</i>

15:59.650 --> 16:01.950
<i>Yeah,</i>

16:03.220 --> 16:05.720
<i>I'd like to, though,</i>

16:26.910 --> 16:29.510
<i>Last week in August.</i>

16:29.580 --> 16:33.380
<i>The Arctic summer has almost ended.</i>

16:33.450 --> 16:39.690
<i>As the time grows short, I'm reluctant to
even sleep, for fear of missing something.</i>

16:39.760 --> 16:43.720
<i>It's hard to imagine
that soon I'll have to leave.</i>

16:43.800 --> 16:47.460
<i>But this place doesn 't belong to man.
It belongs to the wolves.</i>

16:49.900 --> 16:54.140
<i>I can't really be sad, because it's here
that I've begun to feel wonder again,</i>

16:54.210 --> 16:58.670
<i>like when I was a kid,
and this makes me deeply happy.</i>

16:59.680 --> 17:05.780
<i>I wish I could say thank so,
just so, straight into the universe.</i>

17:31.550 --> 17:34.640
<i>The rest of Ootek's family,
traveling through on their way north,</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:37.210
<i>stopped by to spend the night.</i>

17:50.460 --> 17:52.960
<i>(Ootek speaks native language)</i>

17:57.640 --> 18:01.800
He wants me to tell you a story
of when there was nothing in the world

18:01.880 --> 18:05.330
<i>except for a man and a woman,</i>

18:05.410 --> 18:08.070
The woman came to a hole in the ice,

18:08.150 --> 18:14.090
<i>and she reached in and felt something,
so she pulled it out,</i>

18:14.890 --> 18:17.860
<i>And itwasatuktu,which isthecaribou.</i>

18:18.830 --> 18:24.290
<i>And it was this animal that the lnuit
needed for their food and clothing,</i>

18:24.370 --> 18:31.670
<i>For many years there were so many
caribou that the people called them lice,</i>

18:31.740 --> 18:36.440
But soon all the hunting killed off
all the fat, healthy animals,

18:36.510 --> 18:41.540
<i>and the only ones left over
were the weak, sick ones,</i>

18:41.620 --> 18:45.570
Soon they began to breed and multiply,

18:46.850 --> 18:49.850
<i>and the herd got weak,</i>

18:52.190 --> 18:53.990
<i>Sick,</i>

18:58.830 --> 19:01.300
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

19:05.740 --> 19:11.300
<i>So the people came back to the woman
to ask her what to do,</i>

19:11.380 --> 19:14.280
She went back to the hole in the ice,

19:14.350 --> 19:19.120
because she needed a tool
to cut the sickness out of the herd,

19:19.190 --> 19:21.950
<i>and the amarok was born,</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:26.150
<i>Amarok.</i>

19:27.930 --> 19:33.420
The wolves hunted the caribou
and they killed off all the weak, sick ones,

19:34.170 --> 19:38.370
<i>and the people had
all the caribou that they needed,</i>

19:38.440 --> 19:40.770
<i>(speak native language)</i>

19:53.950 --> 19:58.050
<i>She says maybe you're like Ootek,</i>

19:58.130 --> 20:01.620
<i>Maybe a long time ago
the wolf devoured you,</i>

20:06.800 --> 20:09.130
<i>(distant howl)</i>

20:12.170 --> 20:14.160
<i>(howling)</i>

20:25.650 --> 20:27.640
<i>(howling continues)</i>

20:30.060 --> 20:32.390
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

20:37.600 --> 20:40.000
He knows, doesn't he?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.900
<i>He knows what they're saying,</i>

20:43.970 --> 20:48.910
The caribou are coming south
and the hunting will be good,

20:48.980 --> 20:51.770
<i>and the amarok will be there,</i>

21:36.290 --> 21:38.920
<i>We broke camp
and went in separate directions.</i>

21:38.990 --> 21:42.660
<i>Mike went south, while Ootek
led me on a three-day trek,</i>

21:42.730 --> 21:46.060
<i>down out of the high country
and on to the tundra.</i>

21:46.130 --> 21:49.360
<i>There will be wolves there,
he said, as well as the ''tuktu'',</i>

21:49.440 --> 21:54.270
<i>the great caribou herds
that once had sustained his people.</i>

22:41.290 --> 22:43.850
<i>His endurance
is very much greater than mine,</i>

22:43.920 --> 22:46.420
<i>but there are no expectations of me.</i>

22:46.490 --> 22:50.220
<i>Not, I think, because I am the ''kabloona, ''
the white man,</i>

22:50.300 --> 22:54.430
<i>but because he doesn 't recognize
such a thing as impatience.</i>

22:54.500 --> 22:56.970
<i>(thunder)</i>

22:57.040 --> 22:59.030
<i>(chanting)</i>

24:06.970 --> 24:07.960
Whoo!

25:27.590 --> 25:29.580
<i>(caribou grunting)</i>

30:59.520 --> 31:04.120
<i>Deep in the bone,
the marrow reveals the disease.</i>

31:04.190 --> 31:08.560
<i>And she had found the tool
to cut the sickness from the herd.</i>

31:20.310 --> 31:22.300
<i>(chanting)</i>

32:06.350 --> 32:08.340
<i>(distant gunshots)</i>

32:23.800 --> 32:27.260
<i>Gunfire and the smell of gasoline.</i>

32:27.340 --> 32:29.330
<i>(laughter)</i>

32:33.350 --> 32:35.340
<i>(music on radio)</i>

32:48.830 --> 32:51.160
Come on, right over here!

33:02.110 --> 33:03.840
<i>Hello, Rosie,</i>

33:05.910 --> 33:08.110
Is that you, Tyler?

33:09.980 --> 33:12.850
<i>They called off the search,
They wrote you off,</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:16.320
<i>I even said a few Hail Marys for you myself,</i>

33:16.390 --> 33:19.980
<i>But I never believed in ghosts,
How are you?</i>

33:20.060 --> 33:25.220
<i>- You all right? You got all your pieces?
- I'm all right, yeah,</i>

33:25.300 --> 33:28.290
<i>- You've changed,
- I've changed?</i>

33:31.740 --> 33:35.970
What the hell you been
doing out here, anyway?

33:36.040 --> 33:40.740
<i>Tyler, you wouldn't believe what's
happened, It's fantastic, I hit the jackpot,</i>

33:40.810 --> 33:42.940
<i>Two new planes, a new hotel,</i>

33:43.020 --> 33:45.420
Have you seen an old lnuk?

33:45.490 --> 33:49.620
Inuk? Eskimo? Drunk or sober?

33:49.690 --> 33:51.520
<i>Quite sober,</i>

33:54.330 --> 33:56.660
<i>Join the party,</i>

34:04.640 --> 34:07.900
Altogether, 1400acres.

34:07.970 --> 34:12.429
<i>Top of the mountain down to the lake,
including mineral rights,</i>

34:12.510 --> 34:17.780
<i>But the real ace in the hole for us right now
is the hot spring right up there,</i>

34:17.850 --> 34:21.409
<i>Amazing, lncredible, Steaming hot water
coming right out of the ground,</i>

34:21.489 --> 34:24.790
When I say hot water,
what are you thinking?

34:24.860 --> 34:27.190
Sitting in the bath tub?

34:28.389 --> 34:33.389
<i>Japanese, A little bit of advertising,
plenty of raw fish,</i>

34:35.370 --> 34:38.429
<i>Beautiful country all right,</i>

34:38.500 --> 34:41.000
<i>Limitless possibilities,</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:45.600
<i>Japanese, That's a great angle, Rosie,</i>

34:47.280 --> 34:50.250
<i>Wait, You haven't heard the best part,
Listen to this,</i>

34:50.320 --> 34:55.650
Once they've soaked their little buns
in our magic, medicinal hot spring,

34:55.719 --> 34:59.060
<i>you bottle it up, stick a fancy label on it,
they take it home with them,</i>

34:59.130 --> 35:01.820
<i>Before you know it, we'll be
shipping it outta here by the truckload,</i>

35:01.890 --> 35:07.060
<i>And what does it cost us? Nothing,
Just bubbles right out of the ground,</i>

35:07.130 --> 35:09.860
<i>I bet you we could figure out a way
to bottle the air up here, too,</i>

35:09.940 --> 35:12.370
<i>Fantastic,</i>

35:12.440 --> 35:15.430
<i>Gentlemen, here's to the future,</i>

35:34.130 --> 35:36.120
<i>Watch the horns,</i>

35:49.110 --> 35:52.170
<i>Come on, Tyler, Climb in,</i>

35:52.250 --> 35:54.980
<i>I'm taking you out,</i>

35:56.480 --> 36:03.320
<i>Look, Tyler, maybe you can't see it,
but you've gone round the bend a little,</i>

36:04.890 --> 36:07.290
<i>I know, I've seen it before,</i>

36:07.360 --> 36:09.690
<i>Come on, Get in the,,,</i>

36:10.530 --> 36:13.190
<i>(chuckles)</i>

36:14.670 --> 36:17.430
<i>I know where your camp is, Tyler,</i>

36:18.740 --> 36:23.370
<i>I'll meet you there in a couple of days,
We'll talk it over,</i>

36:51.270 --> 36:55.230
<i>How could he have known about
Lupus Base unless he'd been there?</i>

36:55.310 --> 36:57.610
<i>To get back would be
a three-day hike for me,</i>

36:57.680 --> 37:00.840
<i>but for him, it's only minutes away.</i>

38:02.810 --> 38:04.800
<i>(whining)</i>

38:09.550 --> 38:11.540
<i>(whining)</i>

38:25.870 --> 38:28.360
Pups, where's your folks?

38:32.910 --> 38:35.640
<i>It's pretty lonely around here,</i>

38:38.540 --> 38:43.950
<i>Don't you worry about anything,
Everything's gonna be just fine,</i>

38:44.020 --> 38:46.610
<i>(plane overhead)</i>

40:26.990 --> 40:28.980
Get outta there!

40:30.360 --> 40:35.380
Get out of here, Rosie!
I don't want you here! Get out of here!

40:36.360 --> 40:38.520
Get away!

40:55.950 --> 40:58.280
<i>(gunshot)</i>

41:56.740 --> 41:59.070
<i>(music on radio)</i>

42:13.690 --> 42:15.490
<i>Mike,</i>

42:16.430 --> 42:19.630
What are you doing here?

42:19.700 --> 42:23.290
<i>I'm on my way north,
The snow is coming,</i>

42:25.570 --> 42:28.060
Have you seen Ootek?

42:28.140 --> 42:29.700
<i>No,</i>

42:30.810 --> 42:33.610
<i>He just disappeared,
We were out there and he,,,</i>

42:33.680 --> 42:40.310
<i>Yeah, I know, The old ones seem to have
a way of doing that, just disappearing,</i>

42:41.050 --> 42:44.020
<i>Which is what I'm about to do,</i>

42:57.700 --> 43:02.640
Have you seen the wolves?
Have you seen George and Angie?

43:02.710 --> 43:05.300
<i>No, they must have gone north,</i>

43:05.380 --> 43:09.470
<i>No, No, the puppies are still here, They
wouldn't go off and leave the puppies,</i>

43:09.550 --> 43:14.280
<i>Stop worrying about the pups
and start worrying about yourself,</i>

43:14.350 --> 43:18.120
<i>This thing that's happening
is too big for you,</i>

43:21.160 --> 43:24.720
<i>It's a question of how you survive it,</i>

43:28.330 --> 43:30.460
<i>Survival,,,</i>

43:32.070 --> 43:34.600
<i>of the fittest,</i>

44:29.230 --> 44:31.220
<i>(# bassoon playing)</i>

44:42.540 --> 44:45.570
<i>In the end, there were no simple answers.</i>

44:45.640 --> 44:47.640
<i>No heroes, no villains.</i>

44:49.250 --> 44:51.110
<i>Only silence.</i>

45:03.230 --> 45:08.290
<i>But it began the moment
that I first saw the wolf.</i>

45:08.370 --> 45:13.430
<i>By the act of watching them,
with the eyes of a man,</i>

45:13.510 --> 45:17.130
<i>I had pointed the way
for those who followed.</i>

45:20.580 --> 45:22.570
<i>(howling)</i>

46:09.360 --> 46:14.360
<i>The pack returned for the cubs, as
there are no orphans among the wolves.</i>

46:14.430 --> 46:18.870
<i>And eventually the losses of that autumn
became a distant memory.</i>

46:32.720 --> 46:37.350
<i>I believe the wolves went off to a wild
and distant place somewhere,</i>

46:37.420 --> 46:40.120
<i>although I don 't really know,</i>

46:40.190 --> 46:44.690
<i>because I turned away
and didn 't watch them go.</i>
