WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:03.400
- HEY, WE GOT ANYTHING TO EAT
OVER HERE?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.500
- RAY.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.167
- THOUGHT YOUR MOM
WAS MAKING PANCAKES.

00:06.167 --> 00:09.267
- SHE WAS, BUT SHE
GAVE THE GOOD ONES TO ROBERT

00:09.267 --> 00:13.267
AND TOTALLY SHORTED ME
ON THE BLUEBERRY SAUCE.

00:13.267 --> 00:16.800
I HAD LESS ON MY PLATE
THAN HE HAD ON HIS FACE.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.500
- WELL, THAT'S WEIRD,
BECAUSE AMY SAYS

00:19.500 --> 00:21.500
THAT THE SERVICE
HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL OVER THERE.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.667
- OH, YEAH,
WELL, MY TONGUE SHOULD BE BLUE,

00:23.667 --> 00:24.767
AND IT ISN'T.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.600
- YOU KNOW,
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY IT,

00:31.600 --> 00:35.400
BUT WE REALLY DO LOVE
LIVING OVER THERE.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.033
- [mouthing words]

00:42.700 --> 00:43.633
- HELLO, DEARS.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.167
- HEY, MARIE.
- HEY, MARIE.

00:45.167 --> 00:46.967
- LOOK AT AMY.

00:46.967 --> 00:49.800
YOU LOOK MARVELOUS, DEAR.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.700
DOESN'T SHE
LOOK MARVELOUS, DEBRA?

00:51.700 --> 00:54.467
- WHY WOULDN'T SHE?
SHE'S LIVING WITH YOU.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.033
- TRUE.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.567
- [chuckling] YEAH.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.767
- RAYMOND, I MEANT
TO ASK YOU A FAVOR,

01:00.767 --> 01:02.367
BUT YOU LEFT SO QUICKLY.

01:02.367 --> 01:06.333
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
PUT UP MY STORM WINDOWS FOR ME,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.033
'CAUSE LATELY,
I'VE BEEN GETTING A CHILL

01:08.033 --> 01:10.667
WHILE I'M DOING
MY MORNING CALISTHENICS.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.700
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
STORM WINDOWS?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.867
WHY CAN'T ROBERT DO IT?

01:15.867 --> 01:19.600
OR IS HE SLEEPING OFF
HIS BLUEBERRY HIGH?

01:22.333 --> 01:25.033
- SURE, MARIE.
ROBERT COULD DO IT.

01:25.033 --> 01:26.933
- ROBERT HAS
OTHER THINGS TO DO.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.133
- WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT'S HE DO?

01:28.133 --> 01:29.400
- HE PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE

01:29.400 --> 01:31.333
EVERY DAY
TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.167
HE DOESN'T NEED
ANY MORE STRESS.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.267
- WHAT? STRESS?

01:34.267 --> 01:35.600
HE CAN'T POP IN A FEW WINDOWS

01:35.600 --> 01:38.567
AT THE HOUSE
WHERE HE LIVES RENT-FREE?

01:38.567 --> 01:41.000
- YOU KNOW,
THIS LAZY SIDE OF YOU

01:41.000 --> 01:43.733
IS VERY UNATTRACTIVE, RAYMOND.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.533
BUT FINE.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.267
MY JOINTS
ARE A LITTLE STIFF,

01:48.267 --> 01:52.100
BUT I'LL JUST BUNDLE UP
AND HOPE FOR A MILD WINTER.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.300
- ALL RIGHT, MOM.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.800
I'LL PUT IN THE WINDOWS.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.300
- THANK YOU.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.300
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'D WANT TO MAKE

02:06.300 --> 02:08.567
A HOUSE THAT DAD LIVES IN
AIRTIGHT.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.633
TAKE IT OFF.

02:50.633 --> 02:52.333
- [screams]

02:53.733 --> 02:56.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
PEEPING IN MY WINDOW?

02:56.367 --> 02:58.533
- SORRY. IT'S JUST...

02:58.533 --> 03:01.000
[low, sexy voice]
I LIKE 'EM BIG.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

03:04.033 --> 03:05.300
- I'M DOING YOUR JOB.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.667
I'M CHANGING
THE STUPID WINDOWS.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.367
- OH, YEAH?
SINCE WHEN IS THAT MY JOB?

03:08.367 --> 03:09.600
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.633
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ROOM HERE?
HUH?

03:11.633 --> 03:12.867
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

03:12.867 --> 03:14.400
IS THIS A REFRIGERATOR?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.200
- RAYMOND, PLEASE,
I'M VERY BUSY.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.467
- WELL, LOOK AT ALL THIS.

03:18.467 --> 03:20.133
I KNEW AMY TOOK A NIP
ONCE IN A WHILE.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.667
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS A WINO.

03:22.667 --> 03:23.867
- THIS IS NOT
AMY'S DOING.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.400
MA PUT THIS IN FOR US.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I WOULD LIKE TO GET DRESSED.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.100
- WHAT'S WITH THE CANDLES

03:30.100 --> 03:31.400
AND MASSAGE OIL?

03:31.400 --> 03:33.233
- WELL, MA GAVE US
A GIFT BASKET

03:33.233 --> 03:36.700
WHEN WE ALL MOVED IN TOGETHER.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.667
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.667
HOW COME MOM'S DOING ALL THIS
FOR YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN

03:43.667 --> 03:48.900
WITH THE SPECIAL TREATMENT
AND CANDLES AND WINE,

03:48.900 --> 03:51.067
MASSAGE OIL?

03:52.967 --> 03:54.100
OH.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.600
OH.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.733
- WHAT? WHAT?

03:59.733 --> 04:04.033
- GRANDCHILDREN.

04:04.033 --> 04:06.433
SHE WANTS GRANDCHILDREN,

04:06.433 --> 04:10.400
AND SHE'S DOING ALL SHE CAN
TO GREASE THE WHEELS.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.067
- OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.300
- NO, IT'S GOT TO BE.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.533
COME ON, YOU'RE A COP.

04:14.533 --> 04:15.500
PUT IT TOGETHER.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.333
THIS ISN'T A GIFT BASKET.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.067
IT'S A LOVE BASKET.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.633
- YEAH, WHY DO YOU THINK

04:24.633 --> 04:26.500
MOM DOESN'T WANT YOU
WORKING AROUND THE HOUSE?

04:26.500 --> 04:30.067
SHE'S GOT A MUCH BIGGER JOB
FOR YOU.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.700
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.700
- YEAH, I'M TELLING YA!

04:32.700 --> 04:33.933
- NO, YOU ARE WRONG.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.200
YOU SEE, WHAT YOU CAN'T STAND

04:35.200 --> 04:37.333
IS HOW MUCH
MOM LIKES ME AND AMY.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.733
- WHAT?
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:38.733 --> 04:41.467
YOU SEE, AS A TEAM,
AND YOU VERY WELL KNOW,

04:41.467 --> 04:44.233
ME AND AMY BEAT YOU AND DEBRA
HANDS DOWN.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.567
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.500
- OH, IT'S SIMPLY MATHEMATICS,
RAYMOND.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.233
YOU SEE, IF YOU TAKE
MA'S LOVE FOR YOU,

04:50.233 --> 04:53.333
SUBTRACT IT
BY HER DISTASTE FOR DEBRA,

04:53.333 --> 04:56.100
COMPARE IT
TO HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN ME,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.033
ADD IN HER ADORATION FOR AMY,

04:58.033 --> 05:00.500
WE END UP WINNING
BY 15 POINTS.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.433
- YEAH.

05:04.433 --> 05:05.233
15 POINTS.

05:05.233 --> 05:06.233
- THAT'S RIGHT.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.300
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

05:07.300 --> 05:08.700
I WOULD LIKE YOU
OUT OF MY ROOM.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.367
- YEAH, YOUR ROOM.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:10.367 --> 05:11.600
AND IF YOU DON'T LEAVE
RIGHT NOW,

05:11.600 --> 05:14.633
I WILL TAKE OFF MY ROBE
AND HUG YOU.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.333
ONE...

05:16.333 --> 05:17.867
- SHUT UP.
- TWO.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.333
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- THREE.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.600
[yells]

05:32.467 --> 05:33.867
SORRY, MA.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.767
- I REMEMBER IT FROM THE TUB.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.033
LISTEN, ROBBIE.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.333
I WAS AT THE STORE,

05:40.333 --> 05:41.900
AND I PICKED UP
SOME BOXER SHORTS FOR YOU.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.033
THEY'RE SATIN.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.133
- THANKS, MA, BUT YOU KNOW,

05:51.133 --> 05:52.700
BOXER SHORTS
AREN'T REALLY MY THING.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.933
- THAT'S NONSENSE.

05:53.933 --> 05:56.700
THESE BRIEFS THAT YOU WEAR
ARE MUCH TOO TIGHT.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.033
AND LOOK.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.267
THEY MATCH AMY'S EYES.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.033
- OH, MY GOD.

06:08.033 --> 06:11.167
- [chuckling]

06:12.133 --> 06:13.167
- OOH!

06:13.167 --> 06:15.200
OH, SOFT. IT'S SO SOFT.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.533
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.033
I'LL LET YOU
GET YOUR REST, ROBERT.

06:20.033 --> 06:21.567
YOU GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

06:21.567 --> 06:22.867
- NO.
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.000
THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY--

06:24.000 --> 06:26.200
- OH, WAKE UP,
MY FRIEND, HUH?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.867
YOU THINK
YOU'RE IN YOUR BEDROOM,

06:27.867 --> 06:29.133
BUT YOU'RE REALLY IN...

06:29.133 --> 06:32.300
THE INCUBATOR!

06:34.033 --> 06:37.167
[evil laughter]

06:47.733 --> 06:50.600
- AMY!

06:50.600 --> 06:51.600
AMY!

06:53.667 --> 06:54.667
AMY!

06:54.667 --> 06:55.667
- HEY, WHAT IS IT?

06:55.667 --> 06:57.733
HEY, CUTE BOXERS.

07:00.167 --> 07:03.867
- WE'RE BEING PLAYED.
- WHAT?

07:03.867 --> 07:06.133
- YOU KNOW ALL THAT NICE STUFF
THAT MOM'S DOING FOR US?

07:06.133 --> 07:07.800
IT ISN'T
BECAUSE SHE CARES FOR US.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.533
SHE WANTS US TO BREED.

07:11.967 --> 07:15.567
WE'RE LING-LING
AND SING-SING.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.667
- HAVE YOU BEEN RAIDING
OUR LITTLE FRIDGE THIS MORNING?

07:19.667 --> 07:22.333
- AND YOU SEE,
THAT'S ALL PART OF IT.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.400
THE ALCOHOL, THE CANDLES,
THE OIL.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.833
YOU MIX ALL THAT TOGETHER,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET?

07:26.833 --> 07:28.900
A BABY.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.567
- I GUESS THE GIRLS
GET A DIFFERENT SLIDE SHOW

07:31.567 --> 07:34.900
THAN THE BOYS.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.833
- LISTEN.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.067
LISTEN TO ME, AMY.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.033
MOM IS ONLY DOING THIS
FOR ONE REASON.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.800
SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE US.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.000
YOU LIKE THESE BOXERS?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
HUH? DO YA?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.333
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:45.333 --> 07:47.133
SHE BOUGHT THEM
BECAUSE THEY MATCH YOUR EYES

07:47.133 --> 07:48.667
AND WON'T SQUEEZE MY PEAS.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.033
- ROBERT, WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM ALL OF A SUDDEN?

07:55.033 --> 07:56.033
- I'M A COP.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.967
I PUT IT TOGETHER.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.267
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, AMY?

08:00.267 --> 08:03.067
WE ARE LIVING
IN A BABY FACTORY!

08:04.800 --> 08:06.533
WHAT--WHAT--

08:06.533 --> 08:08.333
[sighs]

08:09.800 --> 08:11.533
OKAY.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.800
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
- WHAT AM I DOING?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.000
I'M SEARCHING FOR BUGS--

08:19.000 --> 08:21.967
HIDDEN CAMERAS,
LISTENING DEVICES.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.633
- ROBERT, YOU'RE GOING CRAZY.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.067
- AM I?

08:27.100 --> 08:28.833
OH.
[laughs]

08:28.833 --> 08:31.267
WHAT HAVE WE HERE, HUH?

08:31.267 --> 08:33.867
WE'RE ONTO YOU, MA.

08:33.867 --> 08:36.600
WE'RE ONTO YOU.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.467
- ROBERT, THAT'S A THERMOSTAT.

08:38.467 --> 08:41.233
- OH, WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.867
THIS IS JUST A THERMOSTAT.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.433
BUT LOOK.

08:53.433 --> 08:57.133
IT IS SET TO 72 DEGREES--

08:57.133 --> 09:00.000
OPTIMUM SPAWNING
TEMPERATURE.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.567
- ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.

09:04.567 --> 09:05.767
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER

09:05.767 --> 09:07.467
LIKES TO GET INVOLVED
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES,

09:07.467 --> 09:10.500
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE US?

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
- WHAT IS THAT?
- JUST A CD.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.733
- WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
- WELL, YOUR MOM GAVE IT TO ME.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.633
OH.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.333
- BARRY WHITE?

09:22.867 --> 09:24.967
- THAT IS ODD.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.700
- ODD?
BARRY WHITE?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.767
YOU THINK THIS WAS
IN HER COLLECTION?

09:28.767 --> 09:29.933
YOU THINK SHE LISTENS TO:

09:29.933 --> 09:31.233
[imitating Barry White]
OH, BABY.

09:31.233 --> 09:32.700
TAKE OFF THAT BRASSIERE,
MY DEAR.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.000
THAT'S NOT MOM!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
NO!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.033
[grunts]

09:36.033 --> 09:38.500
SHE WILL STOP AT NOTHING!

09:40.033 --> 09:41.333
- WOW.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.533
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING

09:48.533 --> 09:52.500
THAT MOM WAS STARTING
TO APPRECIATE ME

09:52.500 --> 09:55.267
FOR...MYSELF,

09:55.267 --> 09:59.333
JUST LIKE SHE
APPRECIATES RAYMOND.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.800
IDIOT, IDIOT, IDIOT!

10:01.800 --> 10:04.167
- OH, ROBERT.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.033
IT'S OKAY.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.800
SHE APPRECIATES YOU.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.067
- YEAH.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.233
I'M HER PRIZE STUD.

10:19.067 --> 10:22.467
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

10:22.467 --> 10:24.867
SHE APPRECIATES
YOU SO MUCH

10:24.867 --> 10:26.067
THAT SHE CAN'T WAIT

10:26.067 --> 10:27.967
TO HAVE A BUNCH
OF LITTLE ROBERTS

10:27.967 --> 10:30.300
RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.133
- LITTLE ROBERTS.

10:35.100 --> 10:39.133
- OR LITTLE ROBERTAS.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.833
YOU KNOW,

10:43.833 --> 10:45.033
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF SWEET

10:45.033 --> 10:48.900
IN ITS OWN MANIPULATIVE,
CREEPY WAY.

10:48.900 --> 10:53.233
IT'S LIKE SHE BUILT
A LITTLE NEST FOR US.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.900
I DON'T KNOW.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.800
MAYBE WE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.900
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.167
WE HAVE A PLAN.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.867
OUR DUCKS
AREN'T IN A ROW YET.

11:02.867 --> 11:04.233
I MEAN, WE'RE STILL TRYING

11:04.233 --> 11:06.000
TO, YOU KNOW, GET UP
ENOUGH MONEY TOGETHER.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.433
WE DON'T HAVE
OUR OWN HOUSE.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.167
OUR DUCKS
ARE ALL OVER THE POND.

11:10.167 --> 11:13.000
- WELL, MAYBE ALL OUR DUCKS

11:13.000 --> 11:15.167
DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN A ROW.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.867
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

11:16.867 --> 11:20.033
WE'RE MARRIED;
THAT'S A BIG DUCK.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.333
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NEVER
GONNA WANT KIDS.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.700
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:38.867 --> 11:41.700
YOU MEAN...RIGHT NOW?

11:43.867 --> 11:46.433
- [imitating Barry White]
OH, TAKE OFF THAT BRASSIERE,

11:46.433 --> 11:48.300
MY DEAR.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.000
- TO HELL WITH THE DUCKS.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.000
[grunts]
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.367
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

12:08.367 --> 12:11.533
- MY MOM--I CAN'T GET HER
OUT OF MY HEAD.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.600
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.667
- NO, NO.

12:23.667 --> 12:24.767
SHE'S STILL THERE.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.133
I CAN HEAR HER VOICE.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.367
I CAN HEAR HER VOICE.
"GO, ROBBIE, GO!"

12:34.800 --> 12:36.967
- ROBERT.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.600
- NO, LISTEN.
I JUST CAN'T.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.033
IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR ME.

12:40.033 --> 12:43.100
I CAN'T BREED
IN CAPTIVITY!

12:46.300 --> 12:49.733
- I FOUND A BOOMY BOX.

12:49.733 --> 12:53.100
- WE'RE NOT ANIMALS!

13:05.833 --> 13:07.700
- WELL, DAD, I DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY,

13:07.700 --> 13:09.200
BUT I GOT YOU A STRIPPER.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.300
- SHH!

13:18.967 --> 13:20.233
DAMN!
SHE'S COMING.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.633
- WHO?
- MA.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.300
- JEEZ, RAY, WHY DO YOU LIVE
SO CLOSE TO HER?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.033
- ROBERT.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.267
ROBERT, WHAT IS WRONG?

13:28.267 --> 13:29.500
WHY DID YOU
RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.167
- IT'S NOTHING, MARIE.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.800
I THINK WE JUST
NEED TO BE ALONE.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.600
- WELL, THAT'S FINE.
FRANK, RAYMOND, GET OUT.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.233
-I WANT THEM TO STAY.
I NEED WITNESSES.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.600
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.267
- OKAY, YOU READY
FOR THIS, DEBRA?

13:43.267 --> 13:44.967
TURNS OUT,
THE REASON WHY MOM'S BEEN

13:44.967 --> 13:46.267
SO NICE TO ME AND AMY

13:46.267 --> 13:48.033
IS BECAUSE SHE'S
TRYING TO MANIPULATE US

13:48.033 --> 13:49.800
INTO GETTING PREGNANT.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.333
- OH.
- OH.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.500
- I FEEL BETTER NOW.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.300
- ADMIT IT, MA.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.700
EVER SINCE WE MOVED IN,

14:04.700 --> 14:05.700
YOU'VE BEEN LURING US

14:05.700 --> 14:09.833
INTO SOME KIND
OF VENUS SEX TRAP!

14:09.833 --> 14:12.100
- FIRST OF ALL,

14:12.100 --> 14:14.600
DO NOT SAY "SEX TRAP" TO ME.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.967
AND SECOND OF ALL,

14:15.967 --> 14:17.233
THIS IS
THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING

14:17.233 --> 14:18.400
I'VE EVER HEARD.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.833
I RESENT THE FACT
THAT YOU SEE ME

14:19.833 --> 14:22.733
AS THIS MANIPULATIVE MONSTER.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.067
AND BY THE WAY,
WHAT WOULD BE SO TERRIBLE

14:27.067 --> 14:29.833
IF YOU AND AMY HAD A BABY?

14:29.833 --> 14:31.967
- MA, TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

14:31.967 --> 14:33.800
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME
RIGHT NOW.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.167
- I UNDERSTAND.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK, AMY?

14:37.233 --> 14:40.567
- WELL, I THINK WE BOTH
NEED TO BE READY.

14:40.567 --> 14:42.433
- BUT I AM READY.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.533
- NO, MARIE.
ME AND ROBERT.

14:45.533 --> 14:46.533
- YEAH, MA.

14:46.533 --> 14:48.900
YOU CAN SEE THAT,
CAN'T YOU?

14:48.900 --> 14:50.400
- OF COURSE I CAN.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.133
I ONLY WANT THE BEST FOR YOU.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.133
GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

15:08.567 --> 15:09.733
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

15:12.167 --> 15:14.567
- MARIE, YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:14.567 --> 15:16.200
- WELL, IF THEY WANT TO LIVE
IN MY HOUSE,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.267
THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.400
- MA, COME ON.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.067
NOBODY'S THROWING ANYBODY OUT.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.433
- NO, NO.

15:22.433 --> 15:24.900
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.733
SINCE MARIE HAS BEEN PAYING
SO MUCH ATTENTION

15:26.733 --> 15:31.067
TO THEM LATELY,
SHE'S BEEN NAGGING ME LESS.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.600
ON THE OTHER HAND,

15:32.600 --> 15:37.167
THIS HAS ALSO MADE MY DINNERS
SOMEWHAT TARDY.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
- DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.133
WE'RE MOVING OUT.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.133
COME ON, AMY.
LET'S GO.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.133
- ROBERT, WAIT.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.867
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, MARIE.

15:48.867 --> 15:52.033
I FEEL...USED.

15:52.033 --> 15:54.733
I MEAN, I FELL FOR ALL THIS.

15:54.733 --> 15:55.967
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

15:55.967 --> 15:58.733
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND MY HUSBAND.

15:58.733 --> 16:00.367
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

16:00.367 --> 16:01.967
ROBERT EVEN
WAS WILLING TO TRY,

16:01.967 --> 16:03.367
BUT HE COULDN'T PERFORM

16:03.367 --> 16:05.133
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T
GET YOU OUT OF HIS MIND.

16:05.133 --> 16:08.000
- AMY!

16:18.367 --> 16:20.233
- BELIEVE ME,
AND I'VE TRIED HARD:

16:20.233 --> 16:22.267
IT TAKES A FEW YEARS.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.333
- AND WORST OF ALL,

16:33.333 --> 16:37.833
ROBERT THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU APPRECIATED HIM FOR HIMSELF

16:37.833 --> 16:39.200
AND NOT HIS--

16:39.200 --> 16:41.767
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.900
- AMY, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ROBERT GETS THIS IDEA

16:44.900 --> 16:46.367
THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE HIM.

16:46.367 --> 16:47.367
I DO.

16:47.367 --> 16:48.633
I DO!

16:48.633 --> 16:52.667
IF ANYTHING, I HAVE
ALWAYS FAVORED YOU OVER RAYMOND.

16:52.667 --> 16:56.567
[laughter]

16:56.567 --> 16:58.467
IT'S TRUE.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.300
AND ROBBIE,

17:01.300 --> 17:04.200
I MAY HAVE PAID A BIT MORE
ATTENTION TO RAYMOND,

17:04.200 --> 17:05.667
BUT THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE HE WAS

17:05.667 --> 17:10.167
A NEEDY, SOFT, WEAK
LITTLE BOY.

17:10.167 --> 17:13.367
- WELL, MA...

17:13.367 --> 17:14.967
- YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND--

17:14.967 --> 17:17.100
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO STRONG.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.267
I NEVER HAD TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU BEING BULLIED

17:19.267 --> 17:20.467
ON THE PLAYGROUND,

17:20.467 --> 17:22.967
BECAUSE YOU WERE
ALWAYS A BOY WHO--WHO--

17:22.967 --> 17:26.700
- HAD A 5:00 SHADOW.

17:29.033 --> 17:30.467
- BUT YES,

17:30.467 --> 17:33.633
MAYBE I WAS WRONG
TO TRY TO CREATE CONDITIONS

17:33.633 --> 17:37.933
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU
TO BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY,

17:37.933 --> 17:41.833
AS IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.067
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
IT WOULD BE A WASTE

17:44.067 --> 17:46.867
NOT TO PASS ON
THESE STRONG LEGS,

17:46.867 --> 17:48.567
THESE BROAD SHOULDERS,

17:48.567 --> 17:51.433
AND THIS MARVELOUS
SET OF TEETH.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.133
AWW.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.300
I'M SORRY, RAYMOND,

18:00.300 --> 18:02.700
BUT YOUR TEETH
WERE ALWAYS A DISASTER.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.200
- WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE, MA,

18:06.200 --> 18:11.133
BUT DO YOU REALLY
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THIS?

18:11.133 --> 18:13.733
- NO.

18:13.733 --> 18:16.600
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.800
I OBVIOUSLY HAVE FAILED
AS A MOTHER,

18:18.800 --> 18:20.933
AND I WAS ONLY HOPING
TO HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE

18:20.933 --> 18:22.267
AS A GRANDMOTHER.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.733
- BUT, MARIE,
YOU ARE A GRANDMOTHER.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.033
WHAT ABOUT OUR KIDS?

18:26.033 --> 18:27.933
- OH?

18:27.933 --> 18:30.867
WHERE ARE THEY?

18:30.867 --> 18:32.333
ALLY!

18:32.333 --> 18:33.900
MICHAEL, GEOFFREY.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.733
YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE
THAT I'D WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR,

18:36.733 --> 18:39.833
AND I'D BE SMOTHERED
WITH HUGS AND KISSES.

18:39.833 --> 18:42.567
- YEAH?
- GRANDMA'S HERE.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.567
- HI.
- HI.

18:52.967 --> 18:53.967
- SEE?

18:53.967 --> 18:55.233
- OH, COME ON, MARIE.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.400
YOU KNOW THEY LOVE YOU.
- YEAH.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.167
MAYBE IF YOU JUST GAVE THEM
A LITTLE TIME TO MISS YOU.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.767
- WELL, THERE'LL BE
PLENTY OF TIME SOON ENOUGH.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.700
- HOLD ON, MA.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.367
- DID YOU REALLY MEAN
THOSE NICE THINGS

19:22.367 --> 19:24.600
YOU SAID ABOUT ME--
YOU KNOW, ABOUT MY STRENGTH

19:24.600 --> 19:27.367
AND MY GOODNESS
AND MY TEETH?

19:27.367 --> 19:30.633
- I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THEM
IF I DIDN'T MEAN THEM.

19:30.633 --> 19:33.533
- AND I REALLY AM
THE FAVORITE?

19:40.700 --> 19:41.633
- MA?

19:43.800 --> 19:47.333
- I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO HEAR IT
LIKE THIS, RAYMOND.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.233
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MA?

20:03.233 --> 20:05.900
I THINK AMY AND I

20:05.900 --> 20:07.233
CAN GIVE IT A SHOT.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.067
- WHATEVER YOU WANT, DEAR.

20:09.067 --> 20:10.533
COME ON, FRANK.

20:10.533 --> 20:13.500
I WANT TO MAKE SOME
CHOCOLATE-COVERED STRAWBERRIES.

20:15.267 --> 20:17.867
- I ATE THOSE STRAWBERRIES.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.233
I ATE THAT CHOCOLATE.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.000
AND I DRANK ALL THE BOOZE
IN THE LITTLE FRIDGE.

20:27.967 --> 20:30.633
- ROBERT, ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT ALL THIS?

20:30.633 --> 20:32.367
I JUST GOT THE FEELING
THAT YOUR MOM--

20:32.367 --> 20:33.600
- YEAH, I GOT TO TELL YOU--

20:33.600 --> 20:35.933
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FELL FOR THAT.

20:35.933 --> 20:40.367
- YES, IT CERTAINLY
LOOKS THAT WAY, DOESN'T IT?

20:40.367 --> 20:43.667
OH, SHE MAY BE TREATING ME
AS THE FAVORITE FOR NOW,

20:43.667 --> 20:45.867
BUT AFTER SHE GETS
AMY PREGNANT,

20:45.867 --> 20:48.967
I GO BACK TO BEING NUMBER...

20:48.967 --> 20:52.133
FOUR.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.133
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.233
YOU'RE NUMBER FOUR?

20:55.233 --> 20:56.367
- OKAY, THREE.

21:04.167 --> 21:05.667
BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,

21:05.667 --> 21:10.467
I PLAN ON MILKING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:10.467 --> 21:13.400
[evil laughter]

21:21.467 --> 21:24.600
[loud, rhythmic pounding]

21:32.667 --> 21:35.467
- AH, WE SHOULD'VE JUST
KICKED 'EM OUT.

21:48.833 --> 21:51.733
- [sighs]

21:51.733 --> 21:55.000
I CAN'T EVEN DO THIS
FOR 15 MINUTES.
