04:24.831 --> 04:26.025
Pati!

04:29.068 --> 04:30.660
You monster.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.834
Nuru, don't leave the drinks
where Pati can get at them.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.176
I'm very sorry, Memsahib. That bad, Pati!

04:37.343 --> 04:38.867
It's not really her fault.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.344
You're not supposed to put temptation
in the path of an alcoholic.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.851
She's not a.... She's a rock hyrax.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.222
Yes, and a disgrace to her species.
Anyway, we'll all have to be more careful.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.726
-I'm sure it can't be good for her.
-Yes, but she likes it.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.727
I Know. Now, where did I leave my paints?

04:57.797 --> 04:59.458
Here, Memsahib.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.601
Thank you, Nuru. Will you take Pati?

05:05.538 --> 05:06.869
Thank you.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.245
Now, no more drinking.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.262
I am Joy Adamson...

05:35.335 --> 05:39.135
...and for many years my home has been
in the northern province of Kenya...

05:39.238 --> 05:42.503
...where my husband, George,
was senior game warden.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.946
One of his duties was
to deal with dangerous animals...

05:49.015 --> 05:52.178
...who were a menace
to either human life or to crops.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.254
And we were on safari
in the Boran region...

05:55.321 --> 05:58.449
...where a man-eating lion
had been reported.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.648
Look out!

07:57.777 --> 08:00.007
You've been very successful, haven't you?

08:00.112 --> 08:03.604
-Joy, can you spare a minute?
-Yes, I suppose so. What is it?

08:03.683 --> 08:06.117
I've a little something for you.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.855
-Do they belong to those two up there?
-Yes.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.385
We had to kill the mother.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.160
I'm sorry. She attacked us and
we didn't know why until it was too late.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.169
Poor little dears. Come here, darlings.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.397
Careful!

08:25.505 --> 08:30.636
One gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?

08:30.710 --> 08:34.339
Neither are you when you're hungry.
l don't suppose you've fed them.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.313
No, I can't say I have.

08:36.381 --> 08:39.544
You didn't pack any lion's milk
for me before I left.

08:39.652 --> 08:44.179
You didn't ask me.
Come on, darlings, never mind that brute.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.518
We'll feed you.
We'll make you strong and healthy.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.732
Come on.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.610
Well, that wasn't a great success, was it?

09:06.245 --> 09:09.339
But why don't they?
lt's at least two days since they've eaten.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.939
-They'll just die.
-Yes, I Know.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.678
It must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.551
-We'll just have to try again.
-Right.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.122
Back to the drawing board. Formula....

09:19.225 --> 09:20.556
Thirteen.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.022
George, I've just been thinking
about the cod-liver oil.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.863
Do you think we put too much in?

09:31.737 --> 09:36.470
Twenty-four hours Iater,
they were still refusing food of any kind.

09:36.809 --> 09:40.438
They were actuaIIy dying of starvation
before our eyes.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.251
Formula seventeen.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.293
To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning
to wish I hadn't brought them back.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.954
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetie.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.292
What is it?
What are we going to do with you?

10:36.836 --> 10:38.736
Why won't you eat?

10:40.906 --> 10:42.999
Don't you see you'll die?

10:44.410 --> 10:48.403
Come on, baby,
there's a little sweetie baby.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.178
My little sweeties.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.812
There.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.079
There.

11:38.764 --> 11:41.597
A little nap
and they'll be begging for more.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.134
Yes, thanks to Elsa.

11:43.836 --> 11:44.962
Who?

11:45.104 --> 11:48.596
-The one who took the milk first.
-Oh, yes.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.605
-But why "Elsa"?
-I don't know.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.008
Well, I suppose I do really.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.514
She reminds me of a little girl
I knew at school.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.650
She was the smallest of us all
and not good at games...

12:00.753 --> 12:04.450
...but she was bright and brave and good,
and I liked her very much.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.287
-Her name was Elsa.
-Fair enough.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.755
You're wonderful, too, darling.
After all, you're the one that did it.

12:11.831 --> 12:15.767
Why, sure.
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it.

12:16.669 --> 12:21.038
Formula seventeen. You're a genius.
You really ought to put it on the market.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.198
No.

12:22.641 --> 12:26.839
You see, it would never work
without one special ingredient. This.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.941
I'm not putting that on the market.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.316
Even as babies,
each had a different character.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.856
The largest one,
we called her the "Big One"...

12:39.959 --> 12:42.325
...was vain of her size and strength.

12:42.394 --> 12:46.057
The second largest, Lastika,
was the clown of the three.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.958
But my favorite, of course,
was the smallest, EIsa.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.198
A weakling in size
but the bravest of them all...

12:54.306 --> 12:57.366
...she loved to expIore
and investigate and examine.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.671
And there were no limits to her curiosity.

12:59.745 --> 13:03.647
In the wild, she would have been
the throw-out of the pride...

13:03.716 --> 13:06.685
...for the smallest cub in a Iitter
rarely survives.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.380
But Elsa had no inferiority complex.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.089
AII the cubs were, naturally, housetrained...

13:15.194 --> 13:18.493
...and always took great care
to reach the sandboxes outside.

13:18.564 --> 13:22.523
But, also naturally, there were
a few accidents in the early days...

13:22.601 --> 13:26.093
...and when these happened,
they were most embarrassed.

13:35.714 --> 13:40.117
Unfortunately for Pati,
very soon the cubs were too Iarge for her.

14:43.315 --> 14:47.149
At three months oId, their teeth
were big enough for them to eat meat.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.853
And this soon meant that poor Iittle Elsa
never got her fair share.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.997
So I kept the best bits for her.

15:00.132 --> 15:03.226
George said he was convinced
Elsa thought I was her mother.

15:04.670 --> 15:08.504
Whatever she thought, she made me happy
by following me everywhere...

15:08.574 --> 15:11.668
...and keeping me company
whiIe George was away.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.315
When they grew older
and needed more room to play...

15:17.383 --> 15:20.252
...we put Nuru in charge of them,
and they got along beautifully.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.219
...we put Nuru in charge of them,
and they got along beautifully.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.192
Elsa!

15:33.565 --> 15:35.692
What are you doing? Go away!

15:35.768 --> 15:37.861
Go! Get away!

15:50.816 --> 15:55.276
Getting them out of their cage for their
morning exercise was never a probIem.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.820
Come on, babies.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.989
But putting them to bed was another story.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.088
Come back!

16:08.634 --> 16:11.296
-Come back, Big One.
-Come on, Big One.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.132
Come back, Elsa!

16:14.473 --> 16:15.804
In you go!

16:17.609 --> 16:19.338
Come on. That's it.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.905
Come on. Inside.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.578
And you. There!

16:59.485 --> 17:03.046
Eventually, we had to ban them entireIy
from the house.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.661
To make it up to them,
we hung an old tire from a tree...

17:17.736 --> 17:20.898
...and Elsa particularly fell in Iove with it.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.541
They're beginning to look like lions now.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.676
Yes, and to behave like them, too.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.621
Don't I remember
the father was a man-eater?

17:38.357 --> 17:42.350
You don't believe that man-eating
is an inherited trait, do you?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.086
I don't think anyone really knows.

17:48.534 --> 17:53.403
I hope you're ready for lunch, 'cause I am.
And hungry enough to eat a hyena.

17:53.472 --> 17:57.203
John's just wondering if your cubs
might start eating people one day.

17:57.276 --> 18:01.269
You're joking, of course.
You know my lions are perfect little angels.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.644
Yes, but they'll be very large angels soon.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.116
Isn't it about time you thought
of shipping them off to a zoo?

18:07.219 --> 18:09.210
Is that an order, John?

18:09.321 --> 18:13.485
You're touchy. Have you been feeding him
that lion's milk he's famous for?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.584
Of course it's not an order.
But it's a good idea, isn't it?

18:16.662 --> 18:18.095
Yes, of course, you're right.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.996
We've already arranged to send them
to Rotterdam Zoo.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.591
-We're not ecstatic about it.
-Why? lt's excellent.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.500
He means we're going to miss them.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.129
I know I will, terribly.
Particularly one of them.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.001
Of course you will.
They're absolutely loveable at this age.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.503
-Forgot to shut the gates.
-Heaven help the house. Hurry!

18:35.614 --> 18:37.013
Perfect little angels!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.755
John, be a dear and get hold of Elsa.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.027
-Be careful, she's not very strong.
-Neither am I.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.794
No, you don't understand. She's delicate.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.997
So am I. Let George fetch her.

19:02.040 --> 19:06.306
Would you mind keeping your eye on her?
We'll be back in a moment.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.412
All right, my delicate one. Here I come.

19:14.553 --> 19:18.512
-Joy, would you go back and fetch Elsa?
-Yes. I hope John doesn't scare her.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.648
Steady.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.760
Elsa, you naughty girl.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.929
Don't you understand? He's the boss.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.608
I'm sorry, John,
you must have frightened her.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.506
Come on, come on, darling.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.706
You mustn't be afraid of John.
He likes lions.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.379
AII too soon, we received word
from the Rotterdam Zoo...

19:49.454 --> 19:51.752
...that it was ready to receive the cubs.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.791
We padded and wired the truck.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.558
And each day we took them out
for a long ride...

20:00.632 --> 20:05.399
...in order to prepare them
for the 180-miIe trip to the Nairobi airfieId.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.039
I wouId leave Pati behind on these rides.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.883
She was getting old now,
and I kept her as quiet as possibIe.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.148
-Look after Pati for me, Nuru.
-Yes, Memsahib.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.828
-All right, darling?
-Yes, fine.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.641
-Memsahib. Pati....
-What's happened?

21:24.716 --> 21:28.208
She's very sick, I think from heat.
I think she die.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.185
She's dead.

22:09.361 --> 22:12.057
When the day
that I had been dreading came...

22:12.130 --> 22:14.758
...I went for a last waIk with Elsa.

22:21.306 --> 22:22.534
Elsa?

22:33.452 --> 22:36.114
There you are. Come on.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.586
Come on, come on down.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.092
This way. Come on.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.372
Elsa, no!

22:59.978 --> 23:01.605
Come away. Please!

23:09.888 --> 23:13.619
Thank you, darling. That's a good girl.

23:29.541 --> 23:33.238
If it's any consolation,
I feel as rotten about it as you do.

23:33.345 --> 23:37.577
George, I think I ought to tell you
that just now Elsa....

23:38.350 --> 23:39.908
What about her?

23:40.519 --> 23:41.986
Nothing.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.356
Come on, love. Come on.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.887
There you go, my sweetie.

23:57.936 --> 24:01.064
-l suppose we do have to send them off.
-Yes.

24:01.506 --> 24:02.700
All of them?

24:02.774 --> 24:04.366
Yes, even Elsa.

24:05.710 --> 24:09.737
Even if I told you that she just stopped me
from walking into a great big cobra...

24:09.848 --> 24:12.339
...and that she knew what she was doing?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.854
I'm sorry, it wasn't fair to ask.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.793
Let's get the show on the road,
as they say.

25:56.521 --> 26:00.252
-Would you mind if I did some shopping?
-No, good idea.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.335
-Can you cope?
-Yes, I think so.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.170
I'll meet you outside Ahmed's.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.670
-How will you get there?
-In a taxi.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.687
I know it's silly.
I know she's not a human being.

27:38.790 --> 27:43.056
I know she's just a lion, but I wish
I could stop feeling so miserable.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.492
You will.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.354
No, I'm just a fool.
I'm going to miss her terribly.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.698
You won't, you know.

27:54.739 --> 27:57.173
Elsa, sweetie.

28:00.545 --> 28:04.879
Darling, thank you. Thank you very much.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.496
-Hello, George!
-Hello, John.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.665
Good afternoon, Bwana Kendall.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.030
-Where's Elsa?
-Elsa's not out here today.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.034
Good.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.867
-How's Bwana George?
-Much better now.

29:39.978 --> 29:43.470
But that malaria was very bad.
Good thing he has strong medicine.

29:43.548 --> 29:46.312
Yes. Well, you don't look too bad.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.314
I boxed with Nuru before breakfast,
and earned a draw.

29:49.387 --> 29:50.684
Good.

29:50.955 --> 29:54.618
-Marvelous stuff, these malaria pills.
-Yes, if you don't overdo it.

29:54.692 --> 29:57.320
I'm feeling fine.
Well enough for Joy to go out...

29:57.395 --> 29:59.795
...and you Know she wouldn't go
if I wasn't fit.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.354
Quite. What's she up to?

30:01.466 --> 30:03.195
Having the Land Rover checked.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.998
And in case you're wondering,
Elsa's with her.

30:10.508 --> 30:14.171
I don't understand why everyone assumes
that Elsa and I have a feud.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.735
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.

30:16.014 --> 30:19.677
Actually, George,
I wanted to talk to you about another lion.

30:19.751 --> 30:23.278
You know, the one that's been snatching
all those goats down in Kiunga.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.721
I don't see why you have to travel
all that way in your condition.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.782
Why don't I send Ken, or one of the others?

30:29.027 --> 30:33.293
No, I think I'd like some sea air.
If you can wait until I feel a bit stronger.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.525
I don't mind. A change would do you good.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.763
But don't overdo it, will you?
The best cure for malaria is rest.

30:38.870 --> 30:42.306
I take your point, John.
II'll rest. I promise you.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.374
-Here, isn't that....
-Yes.

31:03.661 --> 31:05.060
Come on, Elsa.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.124
Come on down. Ride's over.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.799
Hurry up. Let's go and see how George is.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.766
Hello, John, how nice of you to drop in.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.570
-Here's some letters for you.
-Thanks.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.905
-How are you?
-Fine.

31:19.978 --> 31:20.808
Good.

31:21.112 --> 31:23.979
-Boxed six rounds with John this morning.
-Earned a draw.

31:24.082 --> 31:27.142
How does it feel to live with
the boxing champion of the world?

31:27.252 --> 31:31.416
Marvelous. We boxed two rounds
this morning and I knocked him out.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.789
Can you stay to dinner?
Or, better still, stay the night.

31:34.859 --> 31:37.692
-I can do both.
-Good. I'll just go and warn the cook.

31:39.097 --> 31:41.691
Poor darling, I've hurt her feelings.

31:42.533 --> 31:43.591
Joy!

31:47.138 --> 31:49.504
Hello, Elsa. Have a nice drive?

31:51.209 --> 31:52.972
-Stop it, Elsa.
-Hello, Elsa.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.443
Get down.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.508
Why don't you go and say hello to John?

31:59.183 --> 32:01.276
You know, I think I'm being snubbed.

32:01.352 --> 32:03.411
-Now stop it, Elsa.
-I hope.

32:03.521 --> 32:07.218
You're getting heavy, Elsa.
Stop it, you're squashing me.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.593
Now, the question is:
What have I forgotten?

32:17.702 --> 32:20.728
Tell you what I've forgotten.
I'm almost out of malaria pills.

32:20.838 --> 32:22.999
Right. Goodbye, darling.

32:23.207 --> 32:26.005
Look after yourself. And no boxing.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.204
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.009
-Goodbye, John. Lovely to see you.
-Thank you.

32:31.082 --> 32:34.108
Now I must say goodbye to Elsa.
Where is she?

32:34.385 --> 32:35.750
On her car.

32:43.561 --> 32:46.928
Elsa, I told you
you couldn't go to Nairobi with me.

32:47.031 --> 32:49.295
Have you met my wife who talks to lions?

32:49.867 --> 32:53.098
Please, come down. Elsa.

32:54.772 --> 32:58.299
-I'm afraid you'll have to help me, Father.
-Good old Dad.

32:58.609 --> 33:01.100
Elsa, don't be such a lunatic. Get down!

33:01.379 --> 33:02.539
Get down!

33:03.915 --> 33:05.212
Come on!

33:05.483 --> 33:07.417
Come on! Good girl.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.095
Will you have another cup of coffee
before you go off?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.727
No, thank you.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.835
What will you do with Elsa
while you're away in Kiunga?

33:29.941 --> 33:31.306
We'll take her with us...

33:31.409 --> 33:33.900
...unless you care to board her
till we get back.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.468
No, thank you.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.277
You know, you're as much her prisoner
as she is yours.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.517
She's not a prisoner. She's a friend.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.019
Yes, I know.

33:44.122 --> 33:48.456
And there's probably no harm in taking her
on a short trip, with reasonable care.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.960
But your long leave is due soon.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.858
Are you planning on taking her
to England for a year?

33:53.965 --> 33:57.731
No, it's a problem.
I've meant to talk to Joy about it, but...

33:57.835 --> 34:00.133
...I suppose I've been waiting.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.400
Don't wait too long.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.305
Look after yourself.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.585
Come on, lunatic.
You're blocking the road.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.587
John wants to go home.

34:20.591 --> 34:21.649
All clear, John.

34:22.927 --> 34:24.326
Thank you.

34:39.543 --> 34:43.446
Now, look, Joy will be back tomorrow.
You can't stay here all night.

34:44.282 --> 34:47.217
Damn it!
Now you've got me talking to you.

34:47.851 --> 34:51.049
Look, she'll be back tomorrow.
I promise you.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.369
Elsa, go away.
Don't you sneak up on me like that.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.906
It's very unpleasant.

35:17.381 --> 35:19.645
Elsa, get down, you idiot.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.043
l don't know.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.828
Stop playing about.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.824
Kindly give me the towel.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.769
Thank you.

35:45.176 --> 35:49.840
Now let's have my dressing gown back.
Come on. Give it to me.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.672
Right away.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.146
Go on, push off!

37:02.587 --> 37:05.522
Hello, Elsa.
Did you look after George for me?

37:11.028 --> 37:12.893
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, George.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.430
-Good trip?
-Not bad. A bit dusty.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.967
-How's Elsa?
-She missed her mom.

37:18.636 --> 37:22.470
l did my best as a babysitter,
but I'm afraid I'm not the type.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.271
Do you Know, she sat out here
all night long waiting for you?

37:26.377 --> 37:29.107
Poor thing. And poor you, too, darling.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.771
Come on, Elsa.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.451
I'll find something nice for you.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.753
George seemed so recovered
from his attack of malaria...

37:40.825 --> 37:43.157
...that we left for Kiunga
the very next day...

37:43.261 --> 37:47.357
...wondering how Elsa wouId react
to the sight of her first ocean.

38:05.816 --> 38:07.977
We reached Kiunga too late for anything...

38:08.052 --> 38:10.953
...except to make camp
and then meet the local fishermen...

38:11.022 --> 38:15.891
...who had come to tell George about their
troubles with the lion killing their goats.

38:15.993 --> 38:20.794
Under the circumstances, Elsa's presence
seemed to puzzIe them considerabIy.

38:41.018 --> 38:43.851
We were tired
and had fallen asleep quickIy.

38:44.155 --> 38:48.683
But I was awakened by noises
coming from near the cars and the kitchen.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.556
There was no doubt that our cars,
or our food...

38:51.662 --> 38:54.927
...were providing
a great temptation to someone.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.365
I didn't want to wake George.

39:00.438 --> 39:03.703
He had looked so tired and paIe
when we arrived.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.825
-George. George!
-What is it?

40:37.902 --> 40:41.531
There's a lion out there.
l think it's John's goat-eater.

40:41.906 --> 40:45.000
Don't be silly.
No lion would come into camp.

40:45.342 --> 40:48.175
lt's probably a hyena,
or a leopard or something.

40:48.245 --> 40:52.409
No, it's a lion. I saw it.
l was out there by the cook tent.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.351
What were you doing....

40:59.056 --> 41:00.387
All right.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.883
Go back to bed.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.881
Did you see him?

42:41.992 --> 42:44.859
Yes, I saw him. Go to sleep.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.367
Well, what happened?

42:54.738 --> 42:57.707
I'd rather not discuss it. Go to sleep.

43:10.454 --> 43:12.251
What are you doing?

43:13.223 --> 43:15.248
Getting a drink of water.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.252
Look, will you or will you not go to sleep?

44:46.717 --> 44:49.777
That's that.
Work finished ahead of schedule.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.646
From tomorrow, we play.

44:55.626 --> 44:57.856
Marvelous watchdog you are!

45:23.287 --> 45:25.915
ImmediateIy after our first waIk
along the beach...

45:26.023 --> 45:31.051
...we all trooped down to the water's edge
to introduce EIsa to the Indian Ocean.

45:31.195 --> 45:34.358
At first she was put off by the growl
and rush of the waves...

45:34.431 --> 45:36.194
...and the taste of the water.

45:36.266 --> 45:38.734
And perhaps,
by the audience we had collected...

45:38.802 --> 45:41.930
...and which was looking on
from a safe distance.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.141
But soon her characteristic curiosity
prevaiIed...

45:46.243 --> 45:48.939
...and she enjoyed herseIf tremendousIy.

46:54.912 --> 46:58.245
She loved playing
almost any game George invented.

46:58.649 --> 47:03.814
At the same time, she exhibited a talent
for foothall that none of us had suspected.

47:34.251 --> 47:36.412
It was a marvelous holiday.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.887
Until one afternoon,
Nuru came panting down the beach...

47:39.957 --> 47:43.415
...to tell me that something
was terribIy wrong with Bwana George.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.392
I ran to our camp.

47:49.733 --> 47:51.598
Let me get the pills.

47:53.303 --> 47:54.361
Joy!

47:58.275 --> 48:00.072
Here, it's all right, darling.

48:00.143 --> 48:01.303
It's all right!

48:03.280 --> 48:04.440
Lie down.

48:04.581 --> 48:07.812
There, that's all right. Just give me those.

48:33.477 --> 48:35.809
Yes, you see, medicine can be very good...

48:35.913 --> 48:39.440
...but too much medicine can be very bad,
and he has taken too much...

48:39.583 --> 48:41.608
...and he has been too active, too soon.

48:41.785 --> 48:45.687
He might very well have died, you see.
Indeed, I'm surprised that he did not.

48:45.889 --> 48:48.949
Goggle fishing too soon, too soon.

48:49.526 --> 48:51.619
He seems to be an impetuous man.

48:51.695 --> 48:54.687
True. He's a mad, impetuous boy.

48:55.532 --> 48:58.330
Then we must curb his impetuosity.
No more goggling.

48:58.635 --> 49:01.365
No. He must rest
and then he will get well.

49:01.471 --> 49:03.200
We'll see to it, Doctor.

49:03.507 --> 49:06.374
Elsa will look after him.
She's a wonderful watchdog.

49:06.476 --> 49:09.206
Yes. I see what you mean.

49:09.313 --> 49:10.371
Goodbye.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.710
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.

49:12.816 --> 49:14.875
You mad, impetuous boy.

49:29.766 --> 49:33.566
Like all hoIidays,
ours was over all too soon.

49:34.371 --> 49:37.499
And it was the last
we wouId ever take together.

49:53.190 --> 49:56.887
The time was approaching
when our Iives would be changed forever.

49:59.896 --> 50:01.955
Elsa was fully grown now.

50:02.299 --> 50:06.759
She had already been in season
and was capabIe of having her own cubs...

50:07.237 --> 50:10.070
...and she started to realize
there was another life...

50:10.140 --> 50:13.041
...than the one
we had been living together.

50:30.127 --> 50:33.221
A little later, our troubIes began.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.440
You okay?

51:07.197 --> 51:10.826
Sorry, but I Know that lioness.
She's a friend of mine.

51:13.537 --> 51:15.732
-You're certain she's all right?
-Completely.

51:15.839 --> 51:18.364
She and her friend Nuru
came over to say hello...

51:18.475 --> 51:22.343
...and then went on for a walk.
But it's a good thing I spotted her collar...

51:22.412 --> 51:24.903
...or Mr. Watson might have claimed
his first bag.

51:25.048 --> 51:27.516
I'm sorry, Mrs. Adamson, I didn't know.

51:27.584 --> 51:31.213
After all, you don't see a lion
sitting in a tree every day.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.353
No, I suppose not.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.550
Actually, we're looking for elephants.

51:35.659 --> 51:37.820
I've got my heart set
on getting an elephant.

51:38.261 --> 51:41.526
Well, we do get elephants here,
but not for shooting.

51:41.731 --> 51:42.925
l don't understand.

51:43.066 --> 51:45.830
They come each year
for the maize and Brussels sprouts...

51:45.902 --> 51:48.894
...which they love,
and they're usually quite well-behaved.

51:49.005 --> 51:51.337
They fascinate Elsa, I'm sorry to say.

51:51.541 --> 51:53.372
This is elephant season now.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.843
Really? Do you think
we might get to see some?

51:56.046 --> 51:57.843
l shouldn't be surprised.

52:35.519 --> 52:38.352
Memsahib, Elsa playing with the elephants.

52:38.455 --> 52:39.513
Many elephants.

52:39.789 --> 52:43.156
No. Sorry. Come along
if you want to see some elephants.

52:43.260 --> 52:44.352
Good.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.592
Remember, they're just for looking at.

52:47.664 --> 52:51.464
-No shooting unless it's necessary.
-l know. But let's go.

52:55.705 --> 52:58.139
Come in the back, there's more room.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.142
Okay!

53:48.725 --> 53:52.559
A few moments Iater, when we passed
through the shambles of a village...

53:52.662 --> 53:56.860
...we saw one of the resuIts
of Elsa's "playing" with the elephants.

53:57.167 --> 54:01.604
As bad as it was, it was a great relief
to learn that no one had been hurt.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.365
But now I was dreadfuIIy afraid...

54:03.440 --> 54:07.206
...that Elsa might have been trampIed
by some angry eIephant.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.674
And then we saw her...

54:13.750 --> 54:18.119
...very happiIy bringing home
a two-year-old souvenir of the occasion.

55:10.707 --> 55:13.608
And the damage, I'm sorry to say,
is considerable.

55:13.677 --> 55:17.477
The complaints and bills for crop damage,
et cetera, are still coming in...

55:17.547 --> 55:19.674
...and will do so for some time to come.

55:19.783 --> 55:24.117
The point is, I'm afraid,
that you can't keep Elsa any longer.

55:24.454 --> 55:27.150
I'm not responsible for the decision.
Don't you see?

55:27.223 --> 55:29.987
Too many people know
she was the cause of the stampede...

55:30.060 --> 55:33.518
...and from now on she'll be blamed
for any lost livestock or damage.

55:33.797 --> 55:37.460
Or for anything that any wild lion
or leopard might do.

55:37.834 --> 55:41.133
On the other hand,
she might very easily be shot by anyone.

55:41.204 --> 55:43.229
I think you were lucky the last time.

55:43.707 --> 55:46.642
She's too big now
to be allowed to roam about...

55:46.710 --> 55:51.147
...even with Nuru or yourselves.
And you can't keep her caged all the time...

55:51.214 --> 55:54.411
...that would only frustrate her
and could make her vicious.

55:54.517 --> 55:58.419
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to find
some zoo that will take her.

55:58.521 --> 56:02.355
I'm certain you'll have no difficulty.
She'd make a wonderful attraction.

56:02.425 --> 56:04.757
Well, we've always known that she....

56:05.495 --> 56:06.655
John...

56:07.097 --> 56:09.031
...I'm sure we can solve this in time.

56:09.199 --> 56:12.293
That's the point, my dear.
There isn't very much time.

56:12.402 --> 56:14.393
Your long leave has come through.

56:14.471 --> 56:15.563
How soon?

56:15.638 --> 56:17.128
In a month. So, you see....

56:17.240 --> 56:20.141
Well, why couldn't we take it here,
in this country?

56:20.243 --> 56:22.211
-George wouldn't mind, right, dear?
-No.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.437
Then we could have time--

56:23.546 --> 56:26.640
You know government policies
for a completely different climate.

56:26.750 --> 56:30.151
I'm certain we could easily find
a good zoo for her in a month.

56:30.253 --> 56:34.781
I don't want her to go to a zoo.
I want to set her free.

56:35.925 --> 56:39.224
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.

56:39.295 --> 56:41.320
You might just as well shoot her here.

56:41.431 --> 56:43.661
He's right. She can't fend for herself.

56:43.767 --> 56:47.259
She's never killed to eat.
She'd starve out there in the bush.

56:47.337 --> 56:48.668
We could teach her.

56:48.772 --> 56:51.741
You've waited too long.
lt's never been done successfully.

56:51.808 --> 56:54.936
We could try.
You know how intelligent she is.

56:55.412 --> 56:59.678
We could teach her, train her.
George, please, let's try.

57:00.016 --> 57:02.450
I'm sorry, darling. I agree with John.

57:02.519 --> 57:05.010
Even if we could show her
how to hunt and kill...

57:05.121 --> 57:08.113
...she'd never hold her own
against wild lions.

57:08.858 --> 57:11.292
I don't want to part with her
any more than you do.

57:11.361 --> 57:14.023
But what's wrong
with sending her to a zoo?

57:14.130 --> 57:15.529
Everything.

57:16.966 --> 57:20.766
I know you think I'm being foolish,
but I know Elsa.

57:21.337 --> 57:24.170
We both know she'd be miserable in a zoo.

57:24.541 --> 57:26.634
Don't you see? She's been free too long.

57:26.709 --> 57:30.008
I can't let her be caged
for the rest of her life.

57:32.115 --> 57:35.278
John, as a friend,
give us just a little more time.

57:35.351 --> 57:39.287
Give us three months to try.

57:40.957 --> 57:42.151
Please!

57:50.633 --> 57:51.861
Please!

57:53.736 --> 57:56.466
All right, my dear,
I'll get you your three months.

57:56.539 --> 57:58.734
But you're wasting your time.

58:00.877 --> 58:04.278
-Could I have another drink, please?
-Yes, of course.

58:10.587 --> 58:14.353
If Elsa were to go wiId,
it wouId have to be in another district...

58:14.424 --> 58:18.952
...and we were able to get permission
to take her to a reserve 340 miIes away...

58:19.295 --> 58:22.958
...where there was abundant game,
and best of all, many Iions.

58:26.603 --> 58:30.869
Whatever George's reservations were,
he did his best not to Iet me see them.

58:30.940 --> 58:32.965
And I was gratefuI to him.

59:18.521 --> 59:20.580
Our plan was to spend the first week...

59:20.657 --> 59:23.683
...taking Elsa around the new country
to get her used to it.

59:23.793 --> 59:27.320
During the second week,
we intended to leave her overnight...

59:27.463 --> 59:31.160
...and to visit, and, if necessary,
feed her in the mornings.

59:31.267 --> 59:33.633
Afterwards,
we intended to reduce her meaIs...

59:33.703 --> 59:38.436
...in the hope that it wouId encourage her
to kill on her own or to join a wild Iion.

59:38.508 --> 59:41.671
Elsa, what are you doing?
That is not your dinner.

59:41.778 --> 59:42.802
Put that back.

59:43.479 --> 59:45.310
On schedule, the day came...

59:45.381 --> 59:49.215
...when we took her out
to leave her overnight for the first time.

59:55.391 --> 59:57.416
Come on, Elsa, up you get.

59:57.827 --> 59:59.089
Come on.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.095
Come on. Today's the day.

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.449
If that's what I think it is....

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.784
Thanks.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:38.131
Crikey. What a bit of lucK.
Right off the bat.

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:41.093
What a handsome fellow.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.271
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:51.137
This could solve everything.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:55.411
-Do you believe in love at first sight?
-I do now. I mean, I hope so.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.578
-George, pray!
-I am!

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.141
So far, so good.

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.252
Why don't you get her down?

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.084
I think we should let her handle this.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.008
All talk and no action.
Beautiful dialogue, though.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.846
You're not funny, George.
I mean, we should give her more time.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.680
-By all means. May I smoke?
-No.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:21.731
This could go on forever.
I think you'd better get her down.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:24.870
All right.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.206
Wait!
We could use a little more room ourselves.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.593
Come on, darling, get down.
Don't be afraid.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.062
I'm sure you'll like him.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:56.263
Come on, Elsa, get down.

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.098
There's a name for girls like her.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.339
All I can say is I'm glad
you didn't behave like that.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.982
I take it you want to try again.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.087
-Yes?
-I was just thinKing.

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:33.856
If there's anything left of that Kill,
and Elsa can get to it...

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:38.297
...and with the fresh scent of lions on it,
she just might get the general idea.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.434
Well, that's good thinKing.
I have a thought.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.836
If we take the kill
to that fellow back there...

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:49.275
...and he thinks she's a good provider,
he might get the general idea, too.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.541
Right. Now it all depends on....

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:59.648
UnfortunateIy,
it turned out to be a large pride...

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:03.488
...who thoroughIy and unhurriedIy
enjoyed their family picnic.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.722
It was severaI hours before we got
to the remains of the zebra...

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:10.321
...and take it and Elsa
back to the young bacheIor.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.300
Luckily, he had remained near his tree.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:20.831
But he was most annoyed
by Elsa's ignorance of lion etiquette...

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.708
...which calls for the lioness
to bring home the food...

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.579
...and then sit by until her lord
and master has had his fill.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:31.915
Poor Elsa, of course, didn't know that
and was properly chastised.

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:14.555
That evening,
we suffered all the agony of parents...

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:18.066
...whose teenage daughter
is out on her first date.

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:34.277
We returned the next day, only to find Elsa
minus both the young lion and her food.

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:56.601
She was so forlorn
and so happy to see us...

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:59.698
...that I felt guilty about the entire episode.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:02.167
We took her back to camp.

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:06.881
We resumed basic training.

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.280
According to plan,
we'd cut down on her meals...

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:13.117
...hoping that hunger
would encourage her to kill for food.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:59.733
But to Elsa, stalking other animaIs
was just a game she never took seriousIy.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:05.568
And she obviousIy enjoyed herself so much
that it was difficult to be angry with her.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.977
George continued to take her out
every day, without resuIt.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.978
Then, one day,
she suddenIy came upon a waethog.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.248
But Elsa's inabiIity to feed herseIf...

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:59.116
...meant that George
had to leave the reserve every day...

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.849
...and drive a very long distance
to another area...

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.722
...where the shooting of game was allowed.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.972
-Tired?
-Yes, I am, a little.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.770
Have a drink.

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:27.274
Yes.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.319
As the weeks sped by...

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.661
...we continued to leave her overnight
as much as possibIe...

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.827
...only to find her in the morning
right where we'd left her...

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:50.803
...hungry and patheticaIIy happy to see us.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.001
Then, one night just before dawn....

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:27.705
It was Elsa, and it was soon apparent
that she'd had some kind of encounter...

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:32.440
...with other lions, or perhaps a leopard,
and had not come off too well.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.896
Sweetie. George.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.861
I can't think how she managed to find us.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:57.070
Yes, she does all the wrong things right.

01:12:58.307 --> 01:12:59.399
Sorry.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.013
After that,
she refused to venture out of camp.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.088
Nice.

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.331
Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:30.694
-Have you any idea what time it is?
-I left my watch in the tent.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:34.436
No, I meant the time of year.
We've only two weeks left.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.343
The rains will be on us soon.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.678
Yes, I know. I know.

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.247
I've been thinking.

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:46.616
We've got to take Elsa out,
and leave her for at least a week...

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:49.418
...and we've got to move camp
so that she can't find us.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:51.390
Make or break, is that it?

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.189
Yes, I'm afraid so.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.863
All right.

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.794
You've missed out
that pretty bit over there.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.432
Did I?

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.434
Yes.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:17.395
At last, both the week
and the rains came to an end.

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:03.181
Well, let's try this.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.553
All my nightmares had come true.

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.159
It won't do.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:48.529
Look, by now it's obvious
she can't make it.

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:51.065
She can't fend for herself,
mix with her own Kind...

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.691
...or do anything
a wild lion must do to survive.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.997
We've....

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.498
You've done too good a job on her.

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:02.942
We've made her tame, and it's too late
to try to let her go wild now.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:06.674
All we're doing is making her miserable,
torturing her.

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:10.010
How can you be so cruel?

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.110
Do you think I enjoy it?

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:15.785
I don't know what goes on
in that head of yours anymore.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:19.691
You have this fixed idea.
What's wrong with a zoo, anyway?

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.093
Nothing, except that she won't be free.

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.724
-And is freedom so important?
-Yes.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.294
Yes!

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:30.738
She was born free,
and she has the right to live free.

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:34.238
Why don't we live in a nice
comfortable city? Other people do.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:38.412
But we've chosen to live out here because
it represents freedom. We can breathe.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.415
-Because we're fit for it.
-So could she be! She can.

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:44.346
-She'll be safe in the zoo.
-Yes, safe.

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.846
And fat and lazy and dull...

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:50.083
...and stupid like some cow
on a milking machine.

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.622
Joy...

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.661
...tell me the truth.

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.188
You just don't want to give her up.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:01.030
What you're hoping is that she can stay
out here wild but not too wild...

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:04.537
...so you can see her every now and then.
That's it, isn't it?

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:08.803
It's not the whole truth,
but I don't deny I'd like it.

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:13.171
It's impossible! It can't happen.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:16.476
Even if she should be able to go wild,
which I doubt...

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:19.042
...that'd be the end.
You'd never see her again.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.712
Then at least she'd be free.

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:23.484
She wouldn't be in a cage
for the rest of her life.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.555
And if she gets herself killed
in the process?

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.537
I'd never forgive myself, I suppose.

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:53.142
AIthough, at one time,
we were afraid she would die...

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.086
...Elsa did recover.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:58.758
And when she did,
she seemed somehow different.

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:04.024
Thanks to John...

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:06.863
...who was wonderfuIIy kind,
despite his reservations...

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.994
...we were able to get a time extension...

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.903
...as well as permission
to take her to another area...

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:14.737
...only 35 miIes from where she was born...

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.608
...and where George
could shoot wild game.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:52.476
Now, as if she knew
what was required of her...

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:56.577
...she started going out aIone,
sometimes for days at a time...

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.817
...only returning when she was hungry.

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:08.625
Then one day,
when we'd followed her into the bush...

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.495
...she caught sight of another waethog.

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:51.401
Well, there's no doubt at all
whose kill that is.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.234
Congratulations.

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:06.347
After that, she proved again and again
that she couId feed herseIf...

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:09.185
...and so when she came into season...

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:13.794
...we took her out for what became
her most dangerous and final test.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.471
No, don't.

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.341
I'm sorry.

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.936
I couldn't stand anymore.

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:43.025
It's all right. It's really all right.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.097
She's done it. She's crossed the bridge.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.061
She's wild now. And free.

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:54.633
You should be very happy. And proud.

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.708
We've....

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.973
You've done something
no one else has ever done.

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.380
And you should be very proud.

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.116
I am...

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.412
...of her.

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:11.153
Well, you might at least stop laughing.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.238
-George?
-Yes?

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.567
Suppose we never see her again?

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:30.475
We will. We'll come back.

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:34.942
We'll come here
as soon as our leave is over...

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.415
...before we do anything else.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:41.184
And we'll find out how she's been.

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:46.692
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:19.088
We did go back.
We had only a week in which to find her.

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:24.991
We camped in the same spot,
and went to look for her every day...

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:26.897
...hoping that we wouId see her...

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:30.164
...and wondering
what she wouId be like if we did.

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:33.500
But we never found any trace of her.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:36.173
Finally, it was our last day.

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.117
Wait.

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.784
Let's try just once more.

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:45.477
Nothing. We start back today.

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:09.788
Elsa and her babies
stayed with us all the afternoon...

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:13.924
...and she made it quite clear
that she was happy to be with us again.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:52.701
I was dying to pick them up and hoId them,
as I had done with Elsa and her sisters.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.309
But I knew that it wouId be wrong.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.872
They were wild...

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:01.871
...and it was better now
that they remained wild.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:18.328
Her master's voice.

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.869
Jump up, Elsa.

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:22.229
We saw her many times again,
born free and living free.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.629
We saw her many times again,
born free and Iiving free.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.730
But to us she was always the same:

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:32.135
Our friend, Elsa.

01:33:33.305 --> 01:33:39.206
