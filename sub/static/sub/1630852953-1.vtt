WEBVTT

00:42.657 --> 00:43.761
Still feeling dizzy?

00:46.005 --> 00:46.833
Not really.

00:49.422 --> 00:50.458
We're almost there.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.578
Ready.

01:20.488 --> 01:21.972
How long have we lived here?

01:23.767 --> 01:24.802
Going on ten years.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.013
C'mon, honey, your
room's this way.

01:33.915 --> 01:36.400
Let's get some light in here.

01:44.512 --> 01:46.203
It's so clean.

01:48.688 --> 01:50.000
Are you hungry?

01:51.622 --> 01:54.453
Actually just kinda tired.

01:54.522 --> 01:56.144
yeah of course.

01:56.213 --> 02:00.252
We can do all this later, okay?

02:34.389 --> 02:35.528
That's exactly
the wrong thing to do.

02:35.597 --> 02:37.220
And your suggestion?

02:37.289 --> 02:38.531
My suggestion?
We keep her GPA up,

02:38.600 --> 02:39.808
we get her used to doing
the things she's used to do,

02:39.877 --> 02:41.534
and we get her back to normal.

02:41.603 --> 02:43.674
She don't want them
hearing through someone else!

02:43.743 --> 02:45.573
And risk losing
the scholarship?

02:45.642 --> 02:46.539
That would be a disaster.

02:46.608 --> 02:47.989
The disaster already happened.

02:48.058 --> 02:49.094
This gets her in front of it.

02:50.509 --> 02:52.338
Are you gonna pay the
tuition once she loses it?

02:52.407 --> 02:53.408
That's not fair.

02:54.858 --> 02:55.893
Hey.

02:55.962 --> 02:56.860
Hi.

03:02.762 --> 03:04.212
Thanks for
bringing the food.

03:04.281 --> 03:05.110
Of course.

03:06.697 --> 03:08.768
So, how long have you
two been divorced?

03:10.563 --> 03:12.117
- About four...
- Four years.

03:14.084 --> 03:17.329
Honey, we have a lot of
time to go over all this.

03:21.056 --> 03:23.058
It's been a week since
the accident.

03:24.232 --> 03:25.992
I know you're overwhelmed.

03:27.235 --> 03:28.512
There's a lot to process.

03:29.893 --> 03:32.413
It's okay, I was just asking.

03:33.621 --> 03:34.380
We're here for you.

03:34.449 --> 03:35.312
We love you.

04:18.838 --> 04:19.667
Was that Ethan?

04:19.736 --> 04:21.738
Yeah. He brought your phone.

04:21.807 --> 04:24.119
He doesn't seem my type.

04:24.189 --> 04:26.536
There are about a hundred
girls in your school who would

04:26.605 --> 04:30.402
be thrilled to hear
you say that.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.921
This is toast, honey.
Won't even turn on.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.131
What do you say we go get
you a new phone?

04:43.173 --> 04:44.795
That's your school...

04:55.358 --> 04:57.083
Look straight head of me,
please,

04:59.741 --> 05:01.433
You still have the ringing?

05:01.502 --> 05:02.468
Yeah, sometimes.

05:03.711 --> 05:06.679
Well, physically,
you're doing great.

05:06.748 --> 05:09.510
That being said, I'm sure
the memory loss

05:09.579 --> 05:11.443
has to be very
disconcerting for you.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.617
When will it come back?

05:13.686 --> 05:15.240
Wish I could tell you
with certainty

05:15.309 --> 05:17.483
how long we're looking at

05:17.552 --> 05:19.623
and to what what extent it
will come back.

05:21.107 --> 05:22.626
So when you say 'to
what extent'.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.490
I'm not trying to
be an alarmist.

05:24.559 --> 05:25.629
Could this be permanent?

05:25.698 --> 05:26.941
I highly doubt it,

05:27.010 --> 05:29.357
but I can't
completely rule it out.

05:48.169 --> 05:49.239
This mine?

05:49.308 --> 05:50.447
Hm-hmm.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.793
Am I a good driver?

05:52.760 --> 05:53.588
It's debatable.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.392
You remember the code?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.431
Yeah, we literally
just set it up.

06:09.466 --> 06:10.812
Okay.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.751
I'm gonna go for break
right after dinner.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.614
If that's okay.

06:22.065 --> 06:23.584
Not too far, okay?

06:23.653 --> 06:25.102
And wear a helmet.

06:25.171 --> 06:26.207
Maybe I shouldn't.

06:26.276 --> 06:28.036
Then if I get knocked on
my head again,

06:28.105 --> 06:29.383
everything will come back.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.607
Hey, you got visitors.

08:31.263 --> 08:32.367
Lexi and Heather.

08:32.437 --> 08:33.990
You remember me telling
you about them?

08:34.059 --> 08:35.405
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.544
They were wondering
if you felt up

08:36.613 --> 08:37.994
to hanging out tomorrow.

08:38.063 --> 08:39.133
Yeah, we have practice

08:39.202 --> 08:40.893
and we thought we'd
go to the lake.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.724
Honey, no pressure.

08:43.793 --> 08:45.450
That might be good, you know?

08:49.074 --> 08:50.351
So, which one of you is Lexi

08:50.420 --> 08:51.766
and which one is Heather?

08:51.835 --> 08:53.423
I'm Lexi.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.839
That's my hoodie you're
wearing by the way.

08:55.908 --> 08:57.496
You took it the last
time we hung out.

08:58.946 --> 09:00.982
Lexi's always
stealing our clothes.

09:01.051 --> 09:02.674
I'm Heather.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.917
Sorry I don't
remember you guys.

09:04.986 --> 09:05.815
It's okay.

09:07.886 --> 09:09.163
Do you wanna come with us?

09:10.198 --> 09:11.717
Yeah, honey.

09:11.786 --> 09:13.374
It'd probably be a good.

09:24.972 --> 09:27.526
So, how's Lexi's and
Heather's experiment going?

09:29.908 --> 09:31.288
You don't really know me,
do you?

09:32.324 --> 09:36.017
Ethan. I saw pictures.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.676
You remember any of this?

09:43.991 --> 09:46.096
Heard you were at the hospital

09:46.165 --> 09:48.720
but they wouldn't
let you see me.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.481
Yeah, yeah you were
really confused, Ali.

09:52.724 --> 09:54.519
I think everyone was
nervous to throw too much

09:54.588 --> 09:57.073
at you at once. That's all.

09:57.142 --> 09:59.593
They said another car
ran a stop sign.

10:02.043 --> 10:02.872
Is everyone okay?

10:05.219 --> 10:07.255
Yeah... yeah they're
good as far as I know.

10:09.188 --> 10:10.604
They're probably relieved,

10:10.673 --> 10:12.744
we're not pressing charges
or suing them or anything.

10:18.853 --> 10:22.650
Could you tell Lexi
and Heather I had to go?

10:22.719 --> 10:24.790
Yeah, yeah, you want me to
give you a ride back home?

10:26.585 --> 10:28.380
Listen, I get it. I get
it if you don't.

10:28.449 --> 10:30.555
Yeah, I kind of
just wanna walk.

10:30.624 --> 10:32.867
It's about two miles
back to your place, Al.

10:34.248 --> 10:35.076
I'll be okay.

10:36.008 --> 10:36.837
Okay.

11:08.075 --> 11:11.665
Ali, you okay?

11:12.735 --> 11:13.563
Hey.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.016
I'm not sure.

11:18.085 --> 11:20.605
Actually I think I got
my directions mixed up

11:20.674 --> 11:22.123
coming from the soccer field.

11:22.192 --> 11:23.608
Where you trying to go?

11:24.678 --> 11:26.231
Do we know each other?

11:26.300 --> 11:27.577
So it is true?

11:28.785 --> 11:29.752
What? What's true?

11:31.443 --> 11:32.858
There's a rumor...

11:35.136 --> 11:36.897
I'm Cameron...

11:36.966 --> 11:41.073
And yeah, we sort of
know each other...

11:42.385 --> 11:45.181
My phone died. Do you
know where I live?

11:45.250 --> 11:48.115
Yeah, you're kind of heading
in the wrong direction.

11:48.184 --> 11:49.564
Oh.

11:49.634 --> 11:51.843
Come on, I'll show you.

11:55.570 --> 11:59.195
So um... what's it like?

12:01.473 --> 12:05.063
If you don't mind
talking about it.

12:05.132 --> 12:06.754
Well you can clearly
walk and talk

12:06.823 --> 12:09.170
so you've got that
going for you.

12:09.239 --> 12:13.209
Yeah. And I can also
chew gum at the same time.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.521
Amazing, right?

12:15.590 --> 12:18.007
Okay. Okay.. Sense of humor.

12:18.076 --> 12:19.077
Another plus.

12:21.527 --> 12:22.736
We're still trying
to figure out

12:22.805 --> 12:23.771
what I know and don't know.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.154
But I can add, subtract,
do calculus,

12:27.223 --> 12:31.227
tie my shoes... and
execute pretty

12:31.296 --> 12:33.643
much any normal task

12:33.712 --> 12:38.441
with efficiency and even style.

12:39.442 --> 12:40.270
Nice.

12:42.134 --> 12:44.136
I seem to know a lot of things

12:44.205 --> 12:48.693
but I'm extremely limited in
the knowledge of one thing.

12:50.729 --> 12:54.146
But that one thing is sort
of the main thing, isn't it?

12:54.215 --> 12:57.425
Yeah. Hmm hm. Me.

13:03.121 --> 13:04.294
So, you in a band?

13:05.399 --> 13:09.127
No. Just practicing. I
do my own stuff.

13:13.407 --> 13:16.962
You know I read about these
Buddhist monks who believe

13:17.031 --> 13:20.897
in a sort of dynamic emptiness.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.106
No past. No future. Only now.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.041
They'd probably love
to have what you have.

13:29.906 --> 13:30.804
They can have it.

13:41.884 --> 13:42.954
Hey, Ali, are you okay?

13:44.334 --> 13:46.612
We talked to Ethan and he
said you just walked away.

13:46.681 --> 13:49.236
Yeah, come on. We'll
take you home, okay.

13:50.685 --> 13:51.721
Thanks for helping.

13:54.586 --> 13:56.726
You really
should have waited for us.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.107
And that kid
you were with,

13:58.176 --> 14:01.835
Cameron Reed, he's not someone
you should be talking to.

14:01.904 --> 14:03.319
He seemed nice to me.

14:03.388 --> 14:06.253
Just let us
help you get back to normal.

14:06.322 --> 14:07.806
We don't want you snapping
out of this and then realize

14:07.875 --> 14:09.808
you've damaged your rep
beyond repair.

14:10.947 --> 14:12.604
Cameron's sort of a loner.

14:12.673 --> 14:14.537
He got arrested over
the summer...

14:14.606 --> 14:15.883
Well that's a rumor.

14:15.952 --> 14:17.367
He's doing court
ordered community

14:17.436 --> 14:19.059
service at the park
because he got

14:19.128 --> 14:20.577
caught tagging at the Grove...

14:20.646 --> 14:22.303
Again, a rumor.

14:22.372 --> 14:23.960
Yeah, but climbing
the towers at the Grove

14:24.029 --> 14:27.688
is kind of announcing you
have some insanity streak.

14:27.757 --> 14:28.758
He's trouble, Ali.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.036
Next thing you know,
you'll be bumping

14:31.105 --> 14:32.762
shoulders in the back
of a cop car.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.902
Just let us take care of you,
Ali.

14:36.697 --> 14:38.216
And please don't tell
your mom we got separated.

14:38.285 --> 14:42.979
She hears that, she definitely
will not let us tutor you.

14:47.363 --> 14:48.191
Yeah.

14:50.262 --> 14:51.539
How'd it go?

14:51.608 --> 14:53.576
Ethan was there.

14:53.645 --> 14:54.715
And?

14:55.612 --> 14:57.166
I don't know.

14:57.235 --> 14:59.306
When I asked him about the
other people in the accident,

14:59.375 --> 15:02.550
he said they're probably
happy we're not suing them.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.520
Thought that was an odd
thing to say.

15:06.589 --> 15:08.660
Yeah, well, he's right.

15:10.248 --> 15:11.007
And he's nice.

15:12.353 --> 15:14.631
And the two of you were
always happy together.

15:15.667 --> 15:16.495
I guess.

15:19.050 --> 15:21.535
Honey, I'm glad you're
making an effort.

15:21.604 --> 15:24.400
You have really great friends...

15:24.469 --> 15:26.264
and they just want
what's best for you.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.300
So you like my friends?

15:28.369 --> 15:31.234
Yeah, of course.
Why would you?

15:31.303 --> 15:32.132
Nothing...

15:33.236 --> 15:34.341
- No? What?
- Nothing.

15:37.482 --> 15:38.655
This came in the mail.

15:39.829 --> 15:41.555
I think it's your
Letter of Intent.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.698
It's due the second
week of November.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.909
Don't they know what happened?

15:50.978 --> 15:51.979
Yeah.

15:52.048 --> 15:53.808
They know that you had a
minor head injury

15:53.878 --> 15:55.189
and it's kept you out of school.

15:55.258 --> 15:55.569
That's it?

15:56.950 --> 16:01.920
Honey, scholarships to elite
schools are very fragile.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.027
Just like the human brain,
huh?

16:06.787 --> 16:08.789
You don't think we should
tell them the whole story?

16:08.858 --> 16:10.895
I think we should give
it a few more weeks.

16:10.964 --> 16:14.622
State has an excellent
pre-law track.

16:14.691 --> 16:17.039
And that's something
you're quite interested in.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.458
So, what's with this?

16:22.527 --> 16:24.322
You brought it home one day.

16:24.391 --> 16:26.220
And I never said why?

16:27.428 --> 16:29.983
Did I want to learn how to play?
Or...

16:30.052 --> 16:31.950
Never said anything to me.

16:32.019 --> 16:34.780
I just thought you liked the
way it looked in your room.

18:01.453 --> 18:02.213
Good morning.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.214
Morning.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.215
Lexi and Heather will be here

18:04.284 --> 18:05.423
after their morning classes.

18:05.492 --> 18:07.942
So, make sure you're
caught up on your reading

18:08.012 --> 18:09.944
and started the worksheets,
okay?

18:10.014 --> 18:11.325
Okay.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.983
And um, if you need anything

18:15.433 --> 18:16.779
or you're not feeling well,

18:18.091 --> 18:20.162
hey, call me. Okay?

18:20.231 --> 18:25.167
Okay. Um, hey, do you mind
if I rearrange my bedroom?

18:29.171 --> 18:33.037
It's okay. Just um...
school work first,

18:33.106 --> 18:34.452
then decorating. Okay.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.698
And I was thinking, maybe you
could uh, mix in a run later.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.114
Get that body going again.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.283
Hey, I was in the
neighborhood.

20:56.352 --> 20:58.009
Just thought I'd
check in on you.

20:59.079 --> 21:00.632
Hi, I'm Cameron.

21:00.701 --> 21:01.840
We met the other day...

21:01.909 --> 21:03.601
Yeah. I just thought you
were my tutors.

21:03.670 --> 21:07.363
No, I'm in PE and we're
running cross country, so.

21:09.745 --> 21:12.092
Looks like you survived the
ride home the other day.

21:15.095 --> 21:18.202
So, I guess I'll uh...
see you around.

21:23.862 --> 21:27.349
Hey look um, I know this place

21:28.660 --> 21:32.561
isn't kind to those
who are lonely or lost.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.115
So just... track me down

21:35.184 --> 21:36.737
if you get feeling like that...

21:40.431 --> 21:45.505
Okay, we've got AP Calc.
AP Chemistry and AP Lit...

21:45.574 --> 21:47.334
And... don't forget.
AP Russian.

21:48.646 --> 21:51.614
First lesson, how to make
kick-ass screwdrivers.

21:51.683 --> 21:52.753
That's a horrible idea.

21:52.822 --> 21:53.858
Since when?

21:53.927 --> 21:56.343
Have you had that in
your bag all day?

21:56.412 --> 21:59.691
Yeah. I've got a whole new way

21:59.760 --> 22:01.141
to reintroduce you to yourself,
Al.

22:01.210 --> 22:02.453
Of course you have.

22:02.522 --> 22:06.077
You love this drink. We
have so many crazy stories

22:06.146 --> 22:07.009
of you and this drink.

22:07.078 --> 22:10.357
Did we actually
take AP Russian?

22:10.426 --> 22:11.393
No, honey.

22:11.462 --> 22:12.601
Alright, ladies.

22:15.155 --> 22:17.606
To unlocking Ali's brain.

22:17.675 --> 22:19.573
If you're uncomfortable
you really don't have to.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.092
It's a de-stress device.

22:30.895 --> 22:35.279
Woo. Come on. Loosen up
so we can get to work.

22:41.768 --> 22:43.114
There we go.

22:45.047 --> 22:46.980
This picture's from
Spring Break.

22:47.049 --> 22:48.084
Last year.

22:48.947 --> 22:49.741
That was crazy.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.295
The hotel was so bad.

22:51.364 --> 22:54.090
Heather found it on Yelp.
Three stars.

22:54.159 --> 22:56.403
I told her we shouldn't
go, but she insisted on it.

22:56.472 --> 22:57.784
I did.

22:57.853 --> 23:02.754
Okay, so... Tell me the
backstory of that picture...

23:05.101 --> 23:06.240
That is so cute...

23:06.310 --> 23:08.070
Oh my gosh. I remember
doing your hair for that.

23:08.139 --> 23:09.485
That's actually my shirt.

23:18.425 --> 23:20.565
Okay, that was good. Yeah.

23:23.741 --> 23:24.569
I got it.

23:25.812 --> 23:27.607
I was good at this?

23:27.676 --> 23:29.056
Yeah. Come on. Let's go again.

23:29.125 --> 23:29.678
Okay.

23:30.989 --> 23:33.578
Did I ever talk about
writing with you guys?

23:33.647 --> 23:34.441
What?

23:35.891 --> 23:38.549
Like... Poetry?

23:40.240 --> 23:41.931
Why? Do you
have an urge to drop

23:42.000 --> 23:43.105
some rhymes or something?

23:47.316 --> 23:48.455
What about guitar?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.665
You bought
it as a joke.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.633
There was an estate
sale over on Ambassador

23:53.702 --> 23:55.393
last summer and you
really wanted to go in.

23:55.462 --> 23:57.947
So, what was the joke?

23:58.016 --> 23:59.052
I don't really remember.

23:59.121 --> 24:01.675
But I think it was about
you take lessons.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.643
You had so much on your plate,

24:03.712 --> 24:05.403
you barely had time to breathe.

24:05.472 --> 24:08.820
Yeah, Student Council.
National Honor Society.

24:08.889 --> 24:10.546
Soccer... track...

24:10.615 --> 24:12.859
Mock trials... Tutoring.

24:12.928 --> 24:15.448
The list goes on and on
for Ali Spencer.

24:21.937 --> 24:22.765
He's here.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.112
What's going on?

24:25.181 --> 24:26.424
Field trip.

24:30.532 --> 24:31.533
Sit upfront.

24:36.779 --> 24:37.677
What's up ladies?

24:40.196 --> 24:43.268
He'll be extra careful, right?

24:43.337 --> 24:46.133
Yeah, I promise, Al.
Come on in.

24:53.486 --> 24:56.558
Yeah, this is my parents pre-
graduation, graduation gift.

24:56.627 --> 24:57.731
For real?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.320
Yeah, I got custom
plates on order too.

25:00.389 --> 25:02.495
Let me guess, "E-Man"?

25:02.564 --> 25:04.324
No Lexi, not E-Man.

25:05.498 --> 25:07.189
I was thinking - It's Lit.

25:07.258 --> 25:09.156
But I spell it all one
word, I-T-S-L-I-T...

25:09.225 --> 25:09.847
Clever.

25:09.916 --> 25:11.262
That's really beautiful.

25:11.331 --> 25:13.816
I don't know. I could have
went with "ETHAN" or E-Man

25:13.885 --> 25:15.853
but I just want to be
incognito some times.

25:15.922 --> 25:17.441
I'm not really an expert but,

25:17.510 --> 25:20.720
I think that's probably as
incognito as a train wreck.

25:20.789 --> 25:21.824
Shut up. It's gonna be sick,

25:21.893 --> 25:22.791
okay.

25:22.860 --> 25:23.895
Where are we going?

25:28.279 --> 25:30.074
Heather, you didn't tell her?

25:30.143 --> 25:32.317
If we told her, it might
mess up the impact.

25:32.386 --> 25:33.215
Seriously?

25:34.768 --> 25:37.322
Okay, Ali, so I
read that people

25:37.391 --> 25:40.947
with memory issues a lot
of the times visit places

25:41.016 --> 25:44.985
from their pasts to try
to reconnect with things.

25:45.054 --> 25:47.298
Okay, so what does that mean?

25:47.367 --> 25:49.196
Ali, we're going to
the crash site.

25:58.482 --> 25:59.931
We landed right there.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.277
Next to that fire hydrant
we took out that

26:01.346 --> 26:02.451
whole section of corn.

26:19.123 --> 26:20.883
Heather, you really
should have told her.

26:20.952 --> 26:22.333
She'll be fine, okay.

26:22.402 --> 26:23.437
I don't know guys.

26:34.621 --> 26:35.829
Hey, Ali.

26:40.489 --> 26:45.459
I'm sorry... this was
a shitty idea.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.708
Come on. Let's go back.

26:55.228 --> 26:56.298
Can I see the car?

27:19.390 --> 27:20.564
I can't believe
you climbed out

27:20.633 --> 27:22.151
of there with barely a scratch.

27:24.464 --> 27:26.466
Well... kind of...

27:38.927 --> 27:40.273
You'll be back soon, Ali.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.461
I wasn't sure the right
time to do this.

27:59.948 --> 28:03.365
You don't remember but, you
used to love wearing this.

28:08.542 --> 28:11.200
I got it for our
anniversary last year.

28:11.269 --> 28:12.098
Wow.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.584
Yeah the chain broke
during the accident.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.966
But one of the EMTs found
it on the floor

28:18.035 --> 28:20.900
and gave it back to me
so I had a jeweler give

28:20.969 --> 28:21.832
it a resetting.

28:24.179 --> 28:25.007
Thank you.

28:26.146 --> 28:27.423
May I?

28:27.492 --> 28:28.321
Yeah.

28:55.659 --> 28:58.972
Do you remember it?
The accident?

29:03.874 --> 29:04.668
Every bit.

29:07.671 --> 29:10.363
It all happened so fast but
when I look back on it now,

29:10.432 --> 29:13.746
it's like slow motion.

29:17.163 --> 29:18.371
The car came out of nowhere.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.513
I swerved to try to avoid it
but we ended up in the field.

29:25.619 --> 29:28.277
The airbags exploded and hit
you in the head pretty hard.

29:29.693 --> 29:30.521
You blacked out.

29:33.697 --> 29:38.598
We finally got you awake
you were really confused.

29:40.462 --> 29:41.705
It was a freak thing, Al.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.680
Look, I'm a little off
my game today.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.825
I don't know the first
thing to say to you.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.070
Or anything for that matter.

30:07.006 --> 30:07.800
I'm sorry, Al.

30:08.662 --> 30:09.905
No. Don't be.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.355
I don't think there's a playbook

30:11.424 --> 30:14.565
on how to connect with your
girlfriend who has amnesia.

30:18.155 --> 30:18.949
It's just...

30:24.299 --> 30:28.855
I don't know, something just
doesn't feel right about us.

30:28.924 --> 30:29.753
No?

30:31.099 --> 30:33.722
I mean a lot of things
since the accident

30:33.791 --> 30:34.792
haven't felt right.

30:37.968 --> 30:39.279
How so?

30:41.212 --> 30:42.766
Did you know I wrote poetry?

30:45.285 --> 30:46.114
No.

30:47.425 --> 30:51.119
Yeah, I found a journal
hidden under my mattress.

30:52.568 --> 30:53.397
Serious?

30:59.161 --> 31:01.750
Why couldn't I trust you
with something like that?

31:08.067 --> 31:11.622
Guys, it's
freezing, can we go?

32:26.766 --> 32:27.594
Dad.

32:29.734 --> 32:30.804
What's up?

32:30.874 --> 32:32.806
There was a great
song on the radio.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.464
So great it put you to sleep?

32:36.707 --> 32:38.122
Landslide.

32:38.191 --> 32:39.883
- That is a great song.
- Yeah.

32:47.476 --> 32:48.753
You work another double?

32:50.514 --> 32:52.378
I used to do them
standing on my head.

32:52.447 --> 32:54.173
Doubles feel more
like triples now.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.107
You just getting back
from school?

32:58.280 --> 33:00.834
Uh, no. Put in some
time at the park.

33:00.904 --> 33:02.146
Thought you wrapped that up.

33:03.251 --> 33:05.839
Almost. Got a few
more hours left.

37:15.365 --> 37:16.780
Hey...

37:16.849 --> 37:18.989
Oh, hey.

37:20.922 --> 37:23.062
You uh... Need directions?

37:23.131 --> 37:27.135
I'm good, actually.
You work here?

37:29.517 --> 37:32.761
Uh... Community
Service Learning.

37:34.694 --> 37:36.765
Actually, it's my last day.

37:36.834 --> 37:38.595
So, riding a bike.

37:38.664 --> 37:40.252
Your tutors seem to be
doing effective work.

37:40.321 --> 37:42.978
My tutors have tried
to bring my memory back

37:43.047 --> 37:47.500
through various methods,
there's soccer, vodka,

37:47.569 --> 37:49.330
bringing me to the scene
of the accident

37:49.399 --> 37:51.228
and showing me the wrecked car.

37:51.297 --> 37:52.712
How's that working out?

37:52.781 --> 37:55.128
Vodka gives me a headache.

37:55.198 --> 37:57.200
Soccer makes me feel
like a complete klutz.

37:57.269 --> 38:02.205
And the car lets me know
I'm lucky to be alive.

38:04.552 --> 38:06.485
Yeah, I'll bet.

38:06.554 --> 38:07.900
What you said yesterday,

38:09.315 --> 38:10.937
about feeling lost?

38:13.664 --> 38:15.597
Why did you say that to me?

38:15.666 --> 38:20.533
Just... Um. I've been there.

38:21.845 --> 38:25.573
And sometimes it feels
like it isn't allowed.

38:25.642 --> 38:29.162
Like being lost is a sign
of weakness or something

38:29.232 --> 38:31.648
which sucks 'cause
it's not true.

38:31.717 --> 38:35.376
And look, I cannot even
begin to imagine

38:35.445 --> 38:36.825
what you're going through

38:36.894 --> 38:38.275
or how you must be
feeling right now.

38:38.344 --> 38:42.521
Yeah, I'm just trying
to find myself, who I was

38:42.590 --> 38:45.006
and who I am, I guess.

38:45.075 --> 38:47.284
Anything you've uh discovered

38:47.353 --> 38:49.321
that's really surprised you?

38:49.390 --> 38:50.218
Yeah.

38:53.428 --> 38:56.224
A notebook that I
write poetry in.

38:56.293 --> 38:58.019
What kind of poems?

38:58.088 --> 39:00.193
I don't know. Just... poems...

39:00.263 --> 39:02.230
Teenage stuff, I guess.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.784
My friends don't seem to
know that I write poetry.

39:05.716 --> 39:06.821
Have you shown anybody?

39:06.890 --> 39:07.718
No.

39:10.134 --> 39:11.895
Well, what are you
waiting for?

39:11.964 --> 39:14.000
I guess I haven't
really thought about it.

39:14.069 --> 39:18.004
And yet, here we are...

39:18.073 --> 39:20.041
You know, Lexi and
Heather told me

39:20.110 --> 39:22.250
to be careful around you.

39:22.319 --> 39:24.045
Oh, you were talking about me.

39:25.288 --> 39:27.773
And they said it's not a
good idea if we hang out?

39:30.258 --> 39:31.846
Maybe you should listen to them.

39:34.711 --> 39:35.539
Hey, wait.

39:38.715 --> 39:41.062
They told me that you
would be here doing

39:41.131 --> 39:43.616
Community Service so I...

39:49.242 --> 39:54.178
I um... Do you really wanna see?

39:55.525 --> 39:56.629
The better question is,

39:56.698 --> 39:58.251
is it even worth the
effort because there

39:58.321 --> 40:01.565
could be tons "I" s dotted with
hearts and like unnecessary

40:01.634 --> 40:06.052
exclamation points and
unicorn stickers.

40:06.121 --> 40:07.813
There are a few hearts,

40:07.882 --> 40:10.747
but no unicorn stickers.

40:10.816 --> 40:11.920
Not yet anyway.

40:15.268 --> 40:17.409
I found this one poem
on a page with a ticket

40:17.478 --> 40:19.100
to the Art Museum.

40:19.169 --> 40:23.242
So I went there and found
this gorgeous painting

40:23.311 --> 40:25.762
with the same name.

40:27.729 --> 40:29.766
- Over Blue?
- Yeah.

40:29.835 --> 40:31.526
It must have meant
something to me.

40:32.803 --> 40:34.218
Ali, you know what this is?

40:37.152 --> 40:38.430
It's a treasure map.

40:39.362 --> 40:41.087
I don't understand.

40:41.156 --> 40:45.195
It's full of clues that may
lead you back to yourself,

40:45.264 --> 40:47.266
to parts of you hidden
from the world that

40:47.335 --> 40:49.406
need to be rediscovered.

40:49.475 --> 40:51.408
I mean you what we need
to do now, right?

40:52.789 --> 40:54.549
We have to decipher this thing.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.275
No, no we don't.

40:56.344 --> 40:59.036
C'mon, you cannot
put something

40:59.105 --> 40:59.968
like this in front of me

41:00.037 --> 41:02.177
and then just leave me hanging.

41:02.246 --> 41:03.247
That's not why I showed you.

41:03.316 --> 41:04.248
Then why did you?

41:07.735 --> 41:09.012
Look, I meant what I said,

41:10.496 --> 41:15.432
okay, if you want some help
navigating... any of this...

41:18.746 --> 41:20.299
What if I don't
like who I find

41:20.368 --> 41:21.818
when I get to the other side?

41:23.854 --> 41:25.822
Then I'd say you'd be
pretty normal.

41:39.249 --> 41:41.251
I cannot believe I
was ever good at this.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.425
It'll come back.

41:44.081 --> 41:47.153
Don't think so much.
Clear your mind,

41:47.222 --> 41:48.638
your muscles know what to do.

41:54.471 --> 41:55.299
That's my girl.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.648
Now we just need to
straighten it out.

41:58.717 --> 41:59.545
Alright.

41:59.614 --> 42:00.650
Twenty more of those

42:00.719 --> 42:02.410
and I may actually be
near the hole.

42:03.584 --> 42:04.412
Don't sweat it.

42:33.096 --> 42:34.235
Hey.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.100
Hey. Did I catch you in
the middle of something?

42:37.169 --> 42:39.067
AP Lit.

42:39.136 --> 42:40.897
Ahh... The Slaughterhouse.
How's that going?

42:40.966 --> 42:43.796
It's hard to say,
just started it.

42:43.865 --> 42:46.350
Hey there's something
in your poetry book.

42:46.419 --> 42:48.387
I didn't think about
it until this morning.

42:49.492 --> 42:52.115
The page with the dried flower.

42:52.184 --> 42:56.119
Emily's Rock or Emily's
Stone' or Emily's something.

42:56.188 --> 42:56.982
Do you know...

42:57.051 --> 42:57.810
Do you remember that?

42:57.879 --> 42:59.122
Yeah.

42:59.191 --> 43:02.021
I think I know what it is.

43:02.090 --> 43:03.747
Can I swing by and pick you up?

43:05.128 --> 43:07.510
I don't know, I've got
study group in a little bit.

43:07.579 --> 43:10.651
I promise to have you back
in time for soccer and shots.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.273
Cameron! Come on.
Just tell me!

43:12.342 --> 43:16.346
I think this really
should be experienced.

43:16.415 --> 43:17.899
Come on. I already
pawned one of my guitars

43:17.968 --> 43:19.452
to get a new tire for my bike.

43:20.868 --> 43:21.731
Okay.

43:38.575 --> 43:43.649
Oh, when you said bike ride
I thought you meant a bike. -

43:43.718 --> 43:44.926
- I brought you a helmet.

43:45.858 --> 43:47.101
I'm not going on that thing.

43:48.516 --> 43:51.105
It looks bad but it's
perfectly safe, I promise.

43:52.347 --> 43:53.556
It's my dad's.

43:53.625 --> 43:54.660
We're fixing it up.

43:54.729 --> 43:56.559
Haven't gotten very far
but it's sturdy.

43:57.663 --> 43:59.354
And I'm a very
responsible driver.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.323
I'm sure you are. But uh...

44:02.392 --> 44:04.359
You know, I read a
quote recently,

44:06.258 --> 44:10.918
once you become fearless,
you become limitless.

44:10.987 --> 44:12.298
Not funny.

44:12.367 --> 44:13.679
We'll take it slow.

44:13.748 --> 44:15.405
You get uncomfortable,
we'll stop.

44:20.272 --> 44:21.584
What do you say?

45:09.217 --> 45:11.426
I think it's over this way.

45:30.653 --> 45:33.345
Yeah... Here it is.

45:38.730 --> 45:41.560
She went to Mendon, which
is a school across town.

45:41.629 --> 45:43.458
And then to B.E. on a
soccer scholarship.

45:44.770 --> 45:46.599
Our schools are big rivals
so I'm thinking you guys

45:46.669 --> 45:49.154
played against each
other a few times.

45:49.223 --> 45:50.500
Oh my god... I knew her?

45:56.299 --> 45:57.680
How'd she die.

45:59.198 --> 46:02.581
OD. Pretty big deal
around here.

46:12.453 --> 46:13.696
I'll go wait by the bike.

46:16.733 --> 46:17.630
Cameron, wait.

46:28.987 --> 46:32.715
I can only hear myself breathe
as I stare at the stone.

46:34.647 --> 46:36.891
I'm trying to see her
face trying to find her,

46:38.030 --> 46:38.859
but she is gone.

46:40.515 --> 46:42.932
Swept away by the winds
of perfection...

46:44.899 --> 46:48.454
Around her... a lonely
patch of bright white

46:48.523 --> 46:50.008
filled with tiny blooms,

46:50.077 --> 46:53.770
trembling under a
windy onslaught.

46:53.839 --> 46:56.186
I tremble too...

46:57.636 --> 46:59.569
as I bend and sometimes break.

47:04.229 --> 47:07.750
But those blooms whitened
with lost innocence,

47:07.819 --> 47:10.511
remind me that I am free.

47:12.824 --> 47:14.308
I am very much alive.

47:15.550 --> 47:17.621
And life is still
awaiting me to live it.

47:32.809 --> 47:34.569
I'm not sure I was very happy.

47:38.677 --> 47:39.954
Well you're still here.

47:41.749 --> 47:44.683
And life is still
waiting for you...

48:16.680 --> 48:17.992
You have been
engrossed up there,

48:18.061 --> 48:19.200
I was calling.

48:19.269 --> 48:20.443
Emily Harris.

48:22.376 --> 48:23.170
Oh...

48:23.239 --> 48:24.067
How well did I know her?

48:25.931 --> 48:30.453
Not well. She was a
couple years older.

48:30.522 --> 48:33.801
You met at soccer camp
when you were a freshman.

48:33.870 --> 48:36.148
Seemed like she had a
pretty perfect life...

48:38.495 --> 48:39.634
Yeah, it was a shock.

48:41.947 --> 48:44.847
It was very sad.

48:48.402 --> 48:49.852
Do I like soccer?

48:50.922 --> 48:51.854
Of course you do.

48:53.234 --> 48:54.201
Ever since you were little,

48:54.270 --> 48:57.376
it lit some internal
fire in you.

48:57.445 --> 48:59.862
Your drive and your focus...

49:02.519 --> 49:04.349
I just don't feel
connected to it,

49:05.729 --> 49:08.801
and shouldn't I? Shouldn't
it be part of my DNA

49:08.871 --> 49:10.493
or my muscle memory
or something?

49:10.562 --> 49:11.943
It'll come back, honey.

49:12.875 --> 49:14.462
This is just stressful.

49:19.709 --> 49:21.124
You know what isn't stressful?

49:22.401 --> 49:24.887
Is your favorite double
chocolate brownies

49:24.956 --> 49:26.889
since you were like
two years old.

49:35.242 --> 49:36.001
Good, right?

49:36.070 --> 49:36.899
Hmm hm.

49:43.043 --> 49:44.941
Thought you had work.

49:46.770 --> 49:49.187
Needed to get out of
there for a few minutes.

49:49.256 --> 49:50.050
Rough night?

49:51.775 --> 49:53.916
It's Friday. And a full moon.

49:56.366 --> 49:58.610
I saw that you put a
tire on the bike.

49:58.679 --> 50:00.543
Got it at the scrap yard.

50:00.612 --> 50:02.131
Got a new rim too.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.580
Still won't pass inspection.

50:04.616 --> 50:06.066
The brake pads gotta be thin.

50:06.135 --> 50:08.758
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
we could work on it together.

50:13.073 --> 50:15.178
Also thought maybe we
could paint the house.

50:19.251 --> 50:21.150
What do you thing about that?

50:26.603 --> 50:28.226
Hours are crazy right now.

50:32.851 --> 50:35.405
Cam, it's not a good time
for a tantrum.

50:38.443 --> 50:39.651
Nothing's gonna get better

50:39.720 --> 50:41.239
if we don't put some
effort into it.

53:00.102 --> 53:02.138
The town abandoned this
in the seventies

53:03.933 --> 53:07.902
and ever since it's become
like a rite of passage

53:07.971 --> 53:10.319
for any knucklehead looking
to leave their mark somewhere.

53:10.388 --> 53:12.286
Did you leave your mark here?

53:12.355 --> 53:14.495
Do I look like a
knucklehead to you?

53:23.849 --> 53:24.988
What do you think?

53:25.057 --> 53:28.751
I don't know. The sign
says no trespassing.

53:28.820 --> 53:31.719
Your poem is about
facing your fears.

53:31.788 --> 53:33.549
I think this is symbolic
of all the things

53:33.618 --> 53:35.447
you're afraid of...

53:35.516 --> 53:38.070
Cameron, you just finished
your community service.

53:38.761 --> 53:39.796
If we get caught...

53:39.865 --> 53:42.627
I did, but this is
something that

53:42.696 --> 53:44.007
was clearly tormenting you.

53:45.423 --> 53:48.391
And I have an obligation to
assist you on your quest.

53:50.876 --> 53:52.154
I don't think we should.

53:55.087 --> 53:56.503
I think you really want to.

54:05.753 --> 54:07.203
Out of my way knucklehead.

54:22.218 --> 54:24.186
What is it you're afraid of?

54:24.255 --> 54:25.670
Afraid of falling?

54:25.739 --> 54:27.775
Flying into the unknown.

54:29.881 --> 54:32.297
Afraid that if I show
my whole self,

54:32.366 --> 54:34.265
the world will turn
its back on me.

54:37.854 --> 54:39.511
Be careful.

54:39.580 --> 54:42.480
That once I am open, I
may be left standing alone.

54:44.482 --> 54:45.448
Like I am now.

54:48.279 --> 54:51.696
Resisting all risk, even
as it rumbles,

54:53.215 --> 54:56.597
even as something hits my
heart with ferocious might,

55:00.256 --> 55:01.844
like a war between what is

55:01.913 --> 55:03.294
and what could be.

55:06.435 --> 55:10.784
And my fear that I may
never be free.

55:17.929 --> 55:22.934
This is The Grove...

55:34.256 --> 55:35.084
Come on.

57:09.730 --> 57:11.387
No way.

57:11.456 --> 57:12.837
I think you should...

57:12.906 --> 57:15.495
I'm pretty sure I was
not an artist.

57:19.015 --> 57:20.258
These walls are
for everyone...

57:21.363 --> 57:23.192
You made the trek, now
leave your mark.

58:02.783 --> 58:06.028
I've never lived outside
the confines of my mind.

58:06.097 --> 58:08.513
And I suppose I still don't.

58:08.582 --> 58:10.342
It's like the world
is a picture.

58:10.412 --> 58:12.172
And the only way for
me to be in it,

58:12.241 --> 58:14.588
is looking at it from afar.

58:19.697 --> 58:22.009
So until that picture
becomes my reality,

58:22.078 --> 58:24.805
and not just this constructed
image now imprinted

58:24.874 --> 58:29.431
in my memory, I will stay
on the outside looking in.

58:38.163 --> 58:42.927
So, my prince, wherever
you are, hold me close.

58:42.996 --> 58:45.550
And whisper in my ear your
fear of letting me go.

58:46.620 --> 58:48.035
I wanna see the world.

58:48.104 --> 58:51.176
And when I do, will you
come with me?

58:52.557 --> 58:57.493
So, my prince, all I want
are, simple little things.

58:59.633 --> 59:01.186
All things sweet.

59:02.256 --> 59:03.913
All things love...

59:04.880 --> 59:07.710
And in return, I will love you.

59:08.711 --> 59:10.299
All the way.

59:19.308 --> 59:20.792
Crisp air and chilled bones.

59:22.207 --> 59:25.383
Light laughter crunches
through the autumn leaves.

59:25.452 --> 59:29.870
New desires are beginning
to take ahold of me

59:29.939 --> 59:34.185
as I see them wisp through
every skeleton in the patch

59:34.254 --> 59:37.084
They stand there bare
to all of us.

59:37.153 --> 59:39.501
and when I look into
their funny faces,

59:40.881 --> 59:42.089
I wanna be bare too...

59:45.196 --> 59:47.509
I want to be stripped
of this old skin

59:47.578 --> 59:50.512
and slip into one that
feels most like me.

59:52.686 --> 59:55.275
Baring my soul to the world.

1:00:03.179 --> 1:00:04.802
Does she ever really see me?

1:00:06.079 --> 1:00:08.426
Or does she only see
what she wants to see.

1:00:09.738 --> 1:00:13.431
Her eyes always keen on
what could be for me.

1:00:14.432 --> 1:00:16.468
But my vision lies elsewhere.

1:00:17.849 --> 1:00:21.681
My eyes veer off into
countless other directions.

1:00:24.131 --> 1:00:27.928
How could I just ignore all
these melodies soft and subtle

1:00:27.997 --> 1:00:32.277
as they ring a beckoning
call into my curious ears.

1:00:32.346 --> 1:00:33.865
And into my earning heart.

1:00:34.866 --> 1:00:36.385
I can hear music in the making.

1:00:37.731 --> 1:00:39.975
I can feel life in the making.

1:00:42.149 --> 1:00:43.219
Okay... Go?

1:00:43.288 --> 1:00:44.117
Yeah.

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:49.467
So my prince,
wherever you are,

1:00:50.813 --> 1:00:52.159
please come with me.

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:57.233
I won't ask for much, I promise.

1:00:59.753 --> 1:01:03.999
All I want are simple
little things.

1:01:05.656 --> 1:01:09.625
All things sweet... all
things love...

1:01:11.006 --> 1:01:15.907
and in return... I will
love you all the way.

1:01:22.258 --> 1:01:23.743
Nice. Okay, try it
with the thumb.

1:01:23.812 --> 1:01:25.676
No, F-sharp... that's the G.

1:01:25.745 --> 1:01:27.298
Yeah, right there.

1:01:28.506 --> 1:01:30.957
Yeah see... that sounds better,
right?

1:01:31.026 --> 1:01:32.406
Try the lick I showed you.

1:01:32.475 --> 1:01:33.407
Uh...

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:39.931
There it is.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.004
Nice.

1:01:44.073 --> 1:01:47.007
So, can I ask you something?

1:01:48.146 --> 1:01:48.975
Sure.

1:01:49.044 --> 1:01:51.011
But you have to be honest.

1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.565
Well that might take
the fun out of the answer.

1:01:53.635 --> 1:01:55.602
Seriously honest.

1:01:56.810 --> 1:01:57.639
Got it.

1:01:59.813 --> 1:02:01.021
Was I nice?

1:02:04.024 --> 1:02:06.544
How would you define
"seriously honest" actually?

1:02:11.963 --> 1:02:14.483
Look... I'm sure if you
polled the student body,

1:02:14.552 --> 1:02:16.312
the majority would say
you were nice.

1:02:17.624 --> 1:02:20.800
People like you. They
like being around you.

1:02:20.869 --> 1:02:23.975
You have this sort of momentum,

1:02:24.044 --> 1:02:28.600
this energy, like you're
gonna lead the charge

1:02:28.670 --> 1:02:29.981
and rip through a banner
and lead the team

1:02:30.050 --> 1:02:32.052
onto the next playing
field or something.

1:02:32.984 --> 1:02:36.091
But uh... I won't lie,

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:39.473
there'd probably be some
people who said

1:02:39.542 --> 1:02:40.854
you're maybe not so nice...

1:02:42.476 --> 1:02:43.305
Keep going.

1:02:45.031 --> 1:02:49.967
That you have the ability to
look right through people...

1:02:51.762 --> 1:02:54.143
even if you're looking right
at them talking to them.

1:02:57.284 --> 1:03:02.255
Wasn't always that way but
in the last year or so, yeah.

1:03:07.191 --> 1:03:11.436
You know people who have that
power might not understand it,

1:03:11.505 --> 1:03:13.991
but for those of us who
it's been used against,

1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:15.302
we know it very well.

1:03:18.133 --> 1:03:20.100
I uh did this to you?

1:03:22.171 --> 1:03:23.345
Does it matter?

1:03:23.414 --> 1:03:25.519
Well yeah we were friends,
right?

1:03:27.211 --> 1:03:29.075
Last time we talked was
freshman year.

1:03:32.112 --> 1:03:33.458
Excuse me.

1:03:33.527 --> 1:03:35.771
You're not giving
me much here.

1:03:37.255 --> 1:03:39.775
♪ Not much to say ♪

1:03:39.844 --> 1:03:40.914
I don't believe you.

1:03:43.779 --> 1:03:45.712
Come on. What aren't
you telling me?

1:03:45.781 --> 1:03:46.609
Nothing.

1:03:49.164 --> 1:03:50.579
Tell me something about us.

1:04:00.175 --> 1:04:01.728
There was no us.

1:04:06.940 --> 1:04:09.701
Oh no. You thief. You thief.

1:04:09.771 --> 1:04:10.633
This is my guitar.

1:04:11.531 --> 1:04:12.325
Ali.

1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:15.638
What the hell's going on here,
Reed?

1:04:15.707 --> 1:04:17.088
Like what are you
even doing here?

1:04:17.157 --> 1:04:19.021
What are you guys
even doing here?

1:04:19.090 --> 1:04:21.058
Looking for you, you're not
returning any of our messages.

1:04:21.127 --> 1:04:22.542
Look, Ali, if you wanted
to break up with me,

1:04:22.611 --> 1:04:23.612
you could have just said
it to my face.

1:04:23.681 --> 1:04:24.440
Ethan, please.

1:04:24.509 --> 1:04:25.545
Dude, you really should chill.

1:04:25.614 --> 1:04:27.581
And you should really
leave her alone,

1:04:27.650 --> 1:04:29.411
not get her involved
in your shit.

1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:30.550
My shit?

1:04:30.619 --> 1:04:32.000
Oh, you wanna say something,
dickhead?

1:04:32.069 --> 1:04:32.828
Seriously, dude?

1:04:32.897 --> 1:04:34.174
Alright guys, stop it.

1:04:35.451 --> 1:04:38.178
Ali, I don't get this.

1:04:38.247 --> 1:04:40.491
Ethan, get out.

1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:41.457
Guys get out!

1:04:45.945 --> 1:04:47.498
Get out of here.

1:04:47.567 --> 1:04:48.395
Ethan.

1:04:52.986 --> 1:04:56.818
Ali, hey, we were
just worried about you.

1:04:56.887 --> 1:04:57.577
You totally ghosted us, okay?

1:04:57.646 --> 1:04:58.820
What's with you?

1:04:58.889 --> 1:05:01.788
I'm just... I just need
some time, you guys.

1:05:01.857 --> 1:05:02.858
With Cameron?

1:05:02.927 --> 1:05:03.928
Heather.

1:05:03.997 --> 1:05:05.896
No. Okay, you can't do
that to Ethan.

1:05:05.965 --> 1:05:07.311
That sucks, Ali.

1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:08.208
Whoa.

1:05:09.106 --> 1:05:10.659
I'm sorry.

1:05:10.728 --> 1:05:12.868
Alright, just... I just
wanna be alone.

1:05:14.111 --> 1:05:16.009
Maybe you should talk
to Ethan first.

1:05:16.078 --> 1:05:17.769
I don't know what you
want me to say, Heather.

1:05:17.839 --> 1:05:19.875
You don't have to say
anything right now. It can wait.

1:05:19.944 --> 1:05:20.703
Lex I think she should...

1:05:20.772 --> 1:05:21.601
It can wait.

1:05:24.052 --> 1:05:25.536
We'll call you later.

1:06:18.278 --> 1:06:20.315
Hey, Ali, it's Cameron.

1:06:20.384 --> 1:06:22.696
Um. Look, I'm sorry
about earlier,

1:06:22.765 --> 1:06:24.284
that wasn't cool.

1:06:24.353 --> 1:06:25.941
I shouldn't of engaged
with Ethan at all

1:06:26.010 --> 1:06:29.807
and um... I'm sure that was
really stressful for you.

1:06:31.913 --> 1:06:32.810
Hope you're okay.

1:06:35.675 --> 1:06:36.952
Yeah, give me a call. Okay?

1:06:43.821 --> 1:06:45.167
What's going on with
you Cameron Reed?

1:06:45.236 --> 1:06:46.272
What?

1:06:46.341 --> 1:06:48.170
What's going on with
Cameron Reed?

1:06:48.239 --> 1:06:49.827
Nothing. We're friends.

1:06:49.896 --> 1:06:51.933
Have you been riding on
his motorcycle?

1:06:52.002 --> 1:06:52.761
Who told you that?

1:06:52.830 --> 1:06:53.417
Have you been?

1:06:54.694 --> 1:06:56.799
Ali, you cannot do that!
You will not do that!

1:06:56.868 --> 1:06:58.387
Oh okay, so now
you're telling me

1:06:58.456 --> 1:06:59.699
what I can and can't do?

1:06:59.768 --> 1:07:01.977
Uh... yes. Last time I
checked I was your mother.

1:07:02.046 --> 1:07:03.461
Feel free to step in
here any time now.

1:07:03.530 --> 1:07:05.049
Let's just all take
a breath here.

1:07:05.118 --> 1:07:07.949
Honey, sounds like Cameron
has his own issues.

1:07:08.018 --> 1:07:09.881
Oh. Okay well maybe one
day I'll find some friends

1:07:09.951 --> 1:07:11.262
without issues.

1:07:11.331 --> 1:07:15.266
'Cause Lexi, Heather, Ethan,
they're perfect, right?

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:16.095
This sounds a
little different.

1:07:16.164 --> 1:07:17.510
Honey, maybe he's not the best

1:07:17.579 --> 1:07:18.752
support system for
you right now.

1:07:18.821 --> 1:07:19.857
You're amazing.

1:07:19.926 --> 1:07:21.617
Look, we know you're
going through

1:07:21.686 --> 1:07:22.998
something difficult right now

1:07:23.067 --> 1:07:25.518
but maybe leaning on
Cameron isn't the best way.

1:07:25.587 --> 1:07:28.728
No. No. No. Nobody knows
what I'm going through.

1:07:28.797 --> 1:07:31.696
Not you, not the doctors,
not the specialists.

1:07:31.765 --> 1:07:33.871
Okay, nobody has an idea
what I should do.

1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:36.943
And now you guys magically
know what I shouldn't do?

1:07:37.012 --> 1:07:39.118
We want you safe,
honey. We want you happy.

1:07:39.187 --> 1:07:41.223
It's a little too
late for that.

1:07:41.292 --> 1:07:43.950
Okay. Terry Hughes called,
from State.

1:07:44.019 --> 1:07:45.503
She wants to know when
you're gonna sign.

1:07:45.572 --> 1:07:47.229
I don't think I should.

1:07:47.298 --> 1:07:49.438
We have to consider
unintended consequences here.

1:07:49.507 --> 1:07:51.268
You'd basically lose
everything you've been

1:07:51.337 --> 1:07:52.959
working towards for
seventeen years.

1:07:53.028 --> 1:07:55.962
You do realize that I may
never be that person again.

1:07:57.584 --> 1:08:00.104
Okay, I may never be that "Ali"
again.

1:08:00.173 --> 1:08:03.004
How about giving that Ali
just a little more time.

1:08:04.281 --> 1:08:06.490
She really is a
wonderful person, you know.

1:08:07.491 --> 1:08:08.733
I'm sure she was great.

1:08:11.529 --> 1:08:16.051
Look, Ali, the truth is,
things have been tight lately.

1:08:17.259 --> 1:08:18.950
And if you want what
State has to offer

1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:21.022
you're gonna need
that scholarship.

1:08:21.091 --> 1:08:23.679
Honestly, I don't
know what I want.

1:08:23.748 --> 1:08:25.854
Do you wanna start
from scratch?

1:08:25.923 --> 1:08:28.167
Get a new passion, maybe
get good enough at it

1:08:28.236 --> 1:08:28.753
to set you apart...

1:08:28.822 --> 1:08:30.031
Stop.

1:08:30.100 --> 1:08:32.619
Try a new college, get
another scholarship maybe?

1:08:32.688 --> 1:08:35.070
Or maybe you want to
try community college.

1:08:35.139 --> 1:08:37.383
Honestly, we did not
raise you to be this way.

1:08:42.629 --> 1:08:43.665
You happy now?

1:08:43.734 --> 1:08:45.563
Thank you very much
for the support.

1:09:44.829 --> 1:09:47.798
Hey... You found me. You good?

1:09:51.457 --> 1:09:52.734
I've got to take a break, Cam.

1:09:52.803 --> 1:09:56.738
I'm kind of over all
of this mystery stuff.

1:09:56.807 --> 1:09:59.879
I thought you were excited
about what you're finding.

1:09:59.948 --> 1:10:02.157
About the you no one
knew existed.

1:10:03.365 --> 1:10:04.539
I don't know if she's real.

1:10:05.712 --> 1:10:08.439
She's real. She's just
kind of afraid.

1:10:08.508 --> 1:10:09.923
And why wouldn't she be?

1:10:09.992 --> 1:10:12.374
I don't know, I have to get
back on track with college.

1:10:12.443 --> 1:10:16.137
And et back on track
with finding Ali.

1:10:17.690 --> 1:10:19.968
I thought that's what
we were doing.

1:10:20.037 --> 1:10:21.694
You know what I mean.

1:11:01.492 --> 1:11:02.528
That was
much better guys.

1:11:02.597 --> 1:11:05.151
It's very important
to keep working

1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:07.084
our angles on the ball...
okay...

1:11:08.016 --> 1:11:09.155
Pass and move.

1:11:18.406 --> 1:11:19.648
Let's go again.

1:12:51.671 --> 1:12:53.190
Cold?

1:12:53.259 --> 1:12:54.260
Oh, you don't have to.

1:12:54.329 --> 1:12:56.814
Yeah, but I'm gonna.

1:12:59.230 --> 1:13:00.024
Thanks.

1:13:02.613 --> 1:13:04.166
I'm really glad you
came out tonight.

1:13:05.858 --> 1:13:06.686
Yeah, me too.

1:13:07.894 --> 1:13:09.655
It sucks not
having you around.

1:13:10.794 --> 1:13:12.278
My mom misses you.

1:13:15.143 --> 1:13:15.902
Really?

1:13:15.971 --> 1:13:16.800
Oh yeah.

1:13:20.597 --> 1:13:23.772
Look, I've been thinking about

1:13:23.841 --> 1:13:25.705
what you said the last
time we were here.

1:13:26.568 --> 1:13:28.190
About us not making sense.

1:13:29.468 --> 1:13:32.505
Look, a lot of things
have been coming at me...

1:13:32.574 --> 1:13:34.024
I know... hang on a second.

1:13:34.956 --> 1:13:37.338
I really wanna tell you this.

1:13:40.686 --> 1:13:44.724
I don't know if... I don't know
if I appreciated you enough.

1:13:47.002 --> 1:13:49.453
Well, I know I didn't.

1:13:49.522 --> 1:13:51.766
And now with everything
that's been happening.

1:13:53.043 --> 1:13:54.596
We're at this weird ground zero.

1:13:57.116 --> 1:13:58.497
I wonder if we have a chance.

1:14:00.395 --> 1:14:04.710
I mean I know you, I
know our history.

1:14:06.919 --> 1:14:08.196
But you don't know me.

1:14:10.750 --> 1:14:11.613
Is that even fair?

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.309
Can there be this... this
different version of us.

1:14:19.863 --> 1:14:21.485
You know that gets to
what we had?

1:14:23.314 --> 1:14:25.178
You mean, a different
version of me.

1:14:34.533 --> 1:14:38.606
How was it? Were we happy?

1:14:42.126 --> 1:14:45.233
Yeah. I mean we
had our moments

1:14:45.302 --> 1:14:48.685
but, yeah, we were happy.

1:14:51.170 --> 1:14:53.414
We had the whole wide world, Al.

1:14:55.346 --> 1:14:57.659
Just want to get back
there with you.

1:14:58.971 --> 1:15:00.282
That sounds really nice.

1:15:03.182 --> 1:15:04.010
Yeah?

1:15:14.193 --> 1:15:15.021
Okay?

1:15:15.850 --> 1:15:17.058
Yeah.

1:15:28.483 --> 1:15:29.311
What's wrong?

1:15:32.211 --> 1:15:37.147
It's just... I just
don't feel like it.

1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:41.462
Yeah. Yeah, okay...

1:15:43.602 --> 1:15:44.982
I'm gonna get going.

1:15:45.051 --> 1:15:47.398
Come on, why? We were
having a good time, Al.

1:15:49.021 --> 1:15:52.921
Look, I understand if
you want to break up.

1:15:54.198 --> 1:15:56.131
It's not fair to you to
have to sit around

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:58.409
and wait for whatever we
had to come back;

1:16:00.826 --> 1:16:02.172
it might not.

1:16:03.449 --> 1:16:05.486
Al, I'm gonna wait as
long as I have to.

1:16:07.349 --> 1:16:08.454
Maybe you shouldn't.

1:16:16.704 --> 1:16:17.498
No.

1:16:19.879 --> 1:16:22.123
What do you mean, no?

1:16:23.849 --> 1:16:25.057
I mean... I mean... no.

1:16:25.126 --> 1:16:26.507
It's not happening.

1:16:27.508 --> 1:16:28.854
Ali, we're not breaking up.

1:16:34.894 --> 1:16:35.723
Come on.

1:16:36.862 --> 1:16:37.621

1:19:55.370 --> 1:19:56.889
It's good to see you.

1:19:56.958 --> 1:19:58.097
Ali, right?

1:19:59.202 --> 1:20:00.237
Yeah.

1:20:00.306 --> 1:20:01.929
You're just in time.

1:20:01.998 --> 1:20:04.310
Potluck Saturday. Grab a plate.

1:20:06.761 --> 1:20:08.349
Is everything okay, honey?

1:20:09.281 --> 1:20:11.559
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

1:20:11.628 --> 1:20:12.974
How's the poetry going?

1:20:14.044 --> 1:20:16.184
Oh. Um. It's...

1:20:16.253 --> 1:20:19.740
We have open mic next
week if you're up to it.

1:20:21.086 --> 1:20:23.329
I'd love to hear what
you've been working on.

1:20:24.330 --> 1:20:25.711
Yeah, maybe...

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.782
Well fill up and I'll
stop by in a bit.

1:20:50.184 --> 1:20:54.740
Hey, everyone. I'm so excited
that you came here tonight.

1:20:54.809 --> 1:20:58.157
It means a lot to me to
see everyone here.

1:20:58.226 --> 1:21:00.642
I'm far from the first
person to tell you

1:21:00.711 --> 1:21:03.231
that growing up is hard.

1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:08.271
The friendships, the pressure
to be perfect, anxiety,

1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.549
feeling like you're
not good enough

1:21:10.618 --> 1:21:13.690
and having to keep up
grades and extracurriculars

1:21:13.759 --> 1:21:15.519
and make a million
different choices about

1:21:15.588 --> 1:21:17.625
the rest of your life.

1:21:17.694 --> 1:21:19.765
It's heavy stuff.

1:21:19.834 --> 1:21:22.423
The pressure is daunting.

1:21:22.492 --> 1:21:25.806
But we're here to help you
carry some of that burden.

1:21:25.875 --> 1:21:27.669
And you're not in this alone.

1:21:41.338 --> 1:21:42.167
Ali Spencer.

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:46.309
You there?

1:21:48.345 --> 1:21:49.174
Yeah.

1:21:50.451 --> 1:21:51.832
Everything okay?

1:21:54.317 --> 1:21:55.732
Everything is not okay.

1:22:00.530 --> 1:22:02.187
It is so not okay.

1:22:04.016 --> 1:22:05.293
What happened?

1:22:10.574 --> 1:22:11.403
Ali?

1:22:17.374 --> 1:22:18.859
Cam I don't know who I am.

1:22:22.932 --> 1:22:24.830
Ali, where are you?

1:22:24.899 --> 1:22:26.970
I don't understand why.

1:22:32.286 --> 1:22:34.012
I'm not who everybody
wants me to be.

1:22:34.081 --> 1:22:35.496
I'm not who my mom
wants me to be.

1:22:35.565 --> 1:22:37.049
I'm not who my dad...

1:22:40.570 --> 1:22:42.192
I'm sorry.

1:22:42.261 --> 1:22:43.711
Ali, tell me where you are.

1:23:04.835 --> 1:23:05.664
Ali!

1:23:10.911 --> 1:23:11.739
Ali!

1:23:14.915 --> 1:23:15.743
Ali!

1:23:19.229 --> 1:23:20.023
Ali!

1:23:23.268 --> 1:23:24.062
Shit.

1:23:25.787 --> 1:23:28.549
You really like testing fate,
huh?

1:23:39.974 --> 1:23:41.217
What happened?

1:23:45.186 --> 1:23:48.224
I feel like the walls
are closing in on me.

1:23:52.297 --> 1:23:55.610
I've felt that.
I've been there.

1:23:55.679 --> 1:23:56.957
Sometimes I'm still there.

1:23:58.510 --> 1:24:00.650
How do you make it stop?

1:24:02.790 --> 1:24:04.412
Wish I had the answer.

1:24:09.521 --> 1:24:13.283
My mind gets very crowded.

1:24:14.940 --> 1:24:17.184
And there are things
that I can't get past.

1:24:18.599 --> 1:24:19.876
Things my dad can't get past.

1:24:19.945 --> 1:24:23.880
But... here I am...

1:24:25.778 --> 1:24:26.779
still going.

1:24:34.580 --> 1:24:36.306
My mom died a few years ago.

1:24:38.205 --> 1:24:42.071
Cancer. And um... I
don't know...

1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:46.834
It was pretty brutal
up until the end there.

1:24:46.903 --> 1:24:49.940
And uh... my dad and I

1:24:50.010 --> 1:24:51.942
have been sort of out of
it ever since.

1:24:54.911 --> 1:24:58.294
So, I know. I get it.

1:24:59.571 --> 1:25:02.746
There are things that are
really hard to get past.

1:25:05.542 --> 1:25:08.442
But, Ali, you just do.

1:25:10.892 --> 1:25:13.274
Just one foot in front
of the other.

1:25:18.417 --> 1:25:20.833
I got a lot of free
space up here, Cameron.

1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:27.702
If those memories ever
get too heavy,

1:25:29.808 --> 1:25:31.499
I'm happy to help you carry 'em.

1:25:42.131 --> 1:25:45.375
Hey, what are you
doing up here?

1:25:46.790 --> 1:25:50.104
No registration. No insurance.

1:25:51.864 --> 1:25:54.384
Three years un-inspected.

1:25:55.420 --> 1:25:56.697
Really?

1:25:56.766 --> 1:25:59.976
Congratulations, your
bike's going to the pound.

1:26:19.754 --> 1:26:22.550
Ali, what is this?
Is it Cameron?

1:26:22.619 --> 1:26:25.484
No it's not. Okay, it's me.

1:26:25.553 --> 1:26:27.037
No... this is not you.

1:26:27.107 --> 1:26:29.005
Climbing into The Grove,
criminal mischief,

1:26:29.074 --> 1:26:30.420
do you have any idea how
close you came

1:26:30.489 --> 1:26:32.353
to getting charged
with something?

1:26:32.422 --> 1:26:33.389
That would have certainly taken

1:26:33.458 --> 1:26:35.805
any scholarship off the table.

1:26:37.841 --> 1:26:38.808
Oh maybe that's plan?

1:26:39.981 --> 1:26:41.569
I have no idea who you
are right now,

1:26:41.638 --> 1:26:42.708
Ali would never do this.

1:26:42.777 --> 1:26:45.815
I'm so sick of you talking

1:26:45.884 --> 1:26:50.130
about this flawless version
of who you think I used to be.

1:26:51.441 --> 1:26:53.029
Okay, that person's gone.

1:26:53.926 --> 1:26:55.031
Not to me she's not.

1:26:56.343 --> 1:26:57.827
Well then you're delusional.

1:26:59.208 --> 1:27:00.209
Your father doesn't
think we should

1:27:00.278 --> 1:27:02.625
let you come and go right
now by yourself.

1:27:02.694 --> 1:27:04.868
Until we can trust you
with your own safety.

1:27:06.594 --> 1:27:08.493
That's not gonna fix it.

1:27:10.978 --> 1:27:15.672
Allison! Keys!

1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:25.889
Thought we had a deal.

1:27:25.958 --> 1:27:27.960
You weren't gonna give
me any more trouble.

1:27:28.029 --> 1:27:30.031
Clearly I'm looking for
your attention.

1:27:31.309 --> 1:27:32.586
Well, you've got it now.

1:27:36.762 --> 1:27:37.798
Little bit late, Dad.

1:27:41.595 --> 1:27:43.631
Hey... wait up.

1:27:43.700 --> 1:27:47.048
You know, I've forgotten
what your smile looks like.

1:27:48.118 --> 1:27:49.810
And you know it
sucks losing mom.

1:27:49.879 --> 1:27:53.054
But it kills me to see
you wasting away inside.

1:27:55.402 --> 1:27:56.196
Cam!

1:27:58.025 --> 1:27:58.853
Cameron!

1:28:25.466 --> 1:28:27.261
Ali, you awake?

1:28:29.125 --> 1:28:29.953
Yeah.

1:28:31.921 --> 1:28:32.749
Can I come in?

1:28:33.923 --> 1:28:34.751
Sure.

1:28:40.343 --> 1:28:42.311
Did she make you come over?

1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:43.277
Wasn't her idea.

1:28:45.693 --> 1:28:46.729
The Grove, huh?

1:28:48.627 --> 1:28:49.387
I'm sorry.

1:28:50.526 --> 1:28:51.699
You know, I
remember bringing you

1:28:51.768 --> 1:28:53.943
home from the hospital
when you were a baby.

1:28:56.117 --> 1:28:57.671
You fit in the crook of my arm.

1:29:00.777 --> 1:29:02.538
We were terrified your
mother and I.

1:29:04.540 --> 1:29:07.025
Always so worried we were
going to hug you too tightly

1:29:07.094 --> 1:29:10.235
or drop you or...
when you slept,

1:29:11.512 --> 1:29:12.720
we would sit beside your crib

1:29:12.789 --> 1:29:15.689
for hours just listening
to you breathe.

1:29:18.623 --> 1:29:21.660
Honey to see you know
with no genuine knowledge

1:29:21.729 --> 1:29:23.904
of the love you come from...

1:29:26.734 --> 1:29:28.288
it hurts to tell you the truth.

1:29:30.945 --> 1:29:32.292
But that's not your problem,

1:29:33.465 --> 1:29:35.467
you've got enough to
worry about.

1:29:35.536 --> 1:29:38.746
What we worry about is
that at least

1:29:38.815 --> 1:29:40.334
you're going to be okay.

1:29:42.750 --> 1:29:43.958
What if I'm not though?

1:29:46.685 --> 1:29:51.138
Like what if this is as
good as it's gonna get.

1:29:52.622 --> 1:29:57.558
Sweetheart, you happy is
the only thing we care about.

1:30:04.945 --> 1:30:08.017
If you really mean that, then

1:30:08.086 --> 1:30:10.606
there's something I'd
like to show you.

1:30:21.479 --> 1:30:26.104
I was having doubts
before the accident.

1:30:27.795 --> 1:30:29.038
About a lot of things

1:30:29.107 --> 1:30:34.112
and... I don't think I felt
I could talk to you guys

1:30:34.181 --> 1:30:38.530
about it 'cause I was afraid
that I'd disappoint you or...

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:40.705
I don't know.

1:30:40.774 --> 1:30:45.088
But... I'm hoping that maybe

1:30:45.157 --> 1:30:46.745
we could figure it out together.

1:30:49.507 --> 1:30:50.439
Yeah.

1:30:50.508 --> 1:30:51.336
You bet.

1:31:06.972 --> 1:31:08.457
Hey, she doesn't know
who she is asshole,

1:31:08.526 --> 1:31:09.285
don't you get that?

1:31:09.354 --> 1:31:10.148
- Back off, dude.
- Ethan!

1:31:10.217 --> 1:31:10.976
Knock it off.

1:31:11.045 --> 1:31:12.150
The Grove, Cam?

1:31:12.219 --> 1:31:12.978
Told you to leave her
out of your shit!

1:31:13.047 --> 1:31:13.841
Ethan!

1:31:13.910 --> 1:31:15.705
Stop. Get inside.

1:31:15.774 --> 1:31:17.120
Ethan, stay right there.

1:31:17.189 --> 1:31:20.434
Hey. Cam. Are you okay?

1:31:20.503 --> 1:31:21.262
Cameron, you okay?

1:31:21.331 --> 1:31:22.091
Yeah.

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:23.161
No, stay down.

1:31:23.230 --> 1:31:25.197
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:31:25.266 --> 1:31:27.199
Cam, you're bleeding.

1:31:47.530 --> 1:31:50.326
Pretty sure you're not the
tutor they're sending over.

1:31:50.395 --> 1:31:52.121
If I am, you're in trouble.

1:31:53.847 --> 1:31:54.641
More trouble.

1:31:57.298 --> 1:31:58.679
Heard you got suspended.

1:32:01.095 --> 1:32:02.442
Yeah, it was stupid, Ali.

1:32:04.305 --> 1:32:05.134
Yeah.

1:32:07.516 --> 1:32:11.036
Look, Ethan, this has to stop.

1:32:11.934 --> 1:32:13.073
Okay, it's over.

1:32:19.666 --> 1:32:22.289
And I feel like it has been,
for awhile.

1:32:23.532 --> 1:32:24.360
Hasn't it?

1:32:26.155 --> 1:32:26.983
Yeah.

1:32:30.435 --> 1:32:31.332
The accident.

1:32:32.575 --> 1:32:33.921
We were arguing in the car.

1:32:35.302 --> 1:32:37.407
You were saying you
needed to make changes.

1:32:40.065 --> 1:32:41.481
You were breaking up with me.

1:32:44.449 --> 1:32:45.933
I was driving really fast.

1:32:47.245 --> 1:32:48.453
Proving all your points.

1:32:50.490 --> 1:32:52.319
I don't know, if I had it
together, maybe I'd have

1:32:52.388 --> 1:32:53.700
seen the car coming sooner.

1:32:56.944 --> 1:32:57.738
Avoided it.

1:33:00.258 --> 1:33:01.397
Avoided all this.

1:33:07.472 --> 1:33:09.025
I'm sorry that I hurt you, Ali.

1:33:12.270 --> 1:33:14.721
I'm sorry that I'm the
reason your old life is gone.

1:33:15.860 --> 1:33:17.862
Hey, it's not all on you,
okay?

1:33:21.693 --> 1:33:23.005
I played a part too.

1:33:26.664 --> 1:33:30.530
But... maybe it's for the best.

1:33:33.947 --> 1:33:34.706
Yeah.

1:33:52.586 --> 1:33:55.658
Thought your parents
had you on lock-down.

1:33:55.727 --> 1:33:56.486
Snuck out.

1:33:57.833 --> 1:34:00.318
You're heading down a
dark path, Ali Spencer.

1:34:02.596 --> 1:34:04.425
I'm sorry you're back here.

1:34:04.494 --> 1:34:05.841
Actually, it's okay.
I'm seriously

1:34:05.910 --> 1:34:07.739
thinking about a career with
the Town Parks Department.

1:34:07.808 --> 1:34:09.361
- Oh yeah?
- Hm. Hmm.

1:34:09.430 --> 1:34:10.535
Yeah, nice try.

1:34:12.019 --> 1:34:13.711
I feel horrible about Ethan.

1:34:14.919 --> 1:34:16.403
Well, maybe I had it coming.

1:34:16.472 --> 1:34:18.025
No, no way.

1:34:18.094 --> 1:34:20.441
That was all him.

1:34:20.510 --> 1:34:22.202
Still... we should chill.

1:34:23.341 --> 1:34:26.689
At least until you get it
all figured out.

1:34:26.758 --> 1:34:29.727
Come on, we don't have
to let things get awkward

1:34:29.796 --> 1:34:31.729
between us.

1:34:33.144 --> 1:34:35.664
Did you get your bike back?

1:34:35.733 --> 1:34:37.079
Nah.

1:34:41.635 --> 1:34:44.120
Look, I really gotta
get back to this.

1:34:44.189 --> 1:34:46.882
Okay. I'll see you around?

1:34:46.951 --> 1:34:48.262
Definitely.

1:34:58.997 --> 1:35:01.413
I'm sure it wasn't
easy to talk

1:35:01.482 --> 1:35:04.727
about certain things with
you or with anyone really.

1:35:06.315 --> 1:35:07.696
No, I get it.

1:35:07.765 --> 1:35:10.319
I know you guys are
really important to me.

1:35:10.388 --> 1:35:13.460
And I truly appreciate you.

1:35:14.634 --> 1:35:17.982
I just think it's gonna
take some time

1:35:18.051 --> 1:35:20.018
to get to where I need to be,
you know?

1:35:21.917 --> 1:35:25.506
So I'm sorry if I seem a
little distant.

1:35:25.575 --> 1:35:28.648
Or if I try some shit that
seems a little out there.

1:35:33.998 --> 1:35:36.034
So what's the deal
with Cameron?

1:35:37.070 --> 1:35:39.382
He just seems to get me.

1:35:41.315 --> 1:35:44.111
I know this sounds stupid
but we just kind of connect.

1:35:44.180 --> 1:35:45.423
You know?

1:35:45.492 --> 1:35:47.149
That's not stupid.

1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:50.221
That's nice, I'm glad
you have that.

1:35:51.429 --> 1:35:53.983
I just... I really want
you to be happy.

1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:57.677
I know. I see it.

1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:03.510
Thanks for showing me
this. It means a lot.

1:36:09.861 --> 1:36:12.830
How much did they hit you
up to get it out of impound?

1:36:13.796 --> 1:36:15.591
Every cent I had.

1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:17.386
Probably more than it's worth.

1:36:17.455 --> 1:36:18.870
Yeah, maybe.

1:36:22.149 --> 1:36:23.357
How bad is it?

1:36:25.843 --> 1:36:27.085
Won't pass inspection.

1:36:31.538 --> 1:36:34.092
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1:36:34.990 --> 1:36:36.577
Yeah, I saw a video.

1:36:45.517 --> 1:36:48.072
What are you trying to do?

1:36:48.141 --> 1:36:50.453
Trying to take the tire off
so I can switch the brakes.

1:36:50.522 --> 1:36:54.388
Okay, let me uh... show
you a trick my dad taught me.

1:37:05.261 --> 1:37:07.574
Go ahead, take the
brake assembly off.

1:37:08.609 --> 1:37:09.438
Okay.

1:37:11.509 --> 1:37:14.305
Yeah, now we're
cooking with gas.

1:37:19.275 --> 1:37:20.104
Okay.

1:37:21.761 --> 1:37:24.591
See here, you take this.

1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:26.282
Small steps.

1:37:27.559 --> 1:37:30.700
Small. Small.

1:37:32.875 --> 1:37:35.740
Small steps...

1:37:38.294 --> 1:37:42.574
And with each passing day
she becomes more victorious.

1:37:44.059 --> 1:37:47.027
So many small steps
yet to be taken.

1:37:48.132 --> 1:37:50.306
But every day is new.

1:37:52.377 --> 1:37:54.034
Every day is possible.

1:37:56.554 --> 1:38:01.490
And one day she will
rise... like the sun...

1:38:02.871 --> 1:38:07.737
beautiful... different...

1:38:08.635 --> 1:38:11.120
Fully alive.

1:38:46.362 --> 1:38:49.503
License and
registration please.

1:38:50.780 --> 1:38:51.989
Just passed inspection.

1:38:53.059 --> 1:38:54.612
She's completely legal.

1:38:54.681 --> 1:38:55.647
Congratulations.

1:38:56.717 --> 1:38:58.823
So, I heard you're
coming back.

1:38:58.892 --> 1:38:59.720
Next week.

1:39:01.274 --> 1:39:04.864
So back on track with
the scholarship?

1:39:06.693 --> 1:39:09.903
Actually, all that's on hold,
for now.

1:39:14.321 --> 1:39:15.633
Well, I'll let you to it.

1:39:17.531 --> 1:39:18.360
Hang on.

1:39:20.810 --> 1:39:23.089
I'm just want you to
know that I'm done

1:39:23.158 --> 1:39:25.367
hoping my memory comes back.

1:39:26.678 --> 1:39:30.303
Trying to solve the
mystery of who I was.

1:39:32.615 --> 1:39:35.791
I'm just creating my
own memories now,

1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:38.380
and whatever happens
happens with the old ones.

1:39:39.829 --> 1:39:44.317
But I'm gonna create a
pretty big memory on Saturday

1:39:44.386 --> 1:39:47.492
and I'd really like
you to be there for it.

1:39:47.561 --> 1:39:48.908
Okay.

1:39:48.977 --> 1:39:51.048
I'll text you the details.

1:39:51.117 --> 1:39:52.532
I think you'll like it.

1:39:53.843 --> 1:39:55.259
I hope you will.

1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:06.063
Cam, I meant what I said.

1:40:08.237 --> 1:40:11.344
If you ever need someone to
help you un-crowd that brain,

1:40:12.448 --> 1:40:13.622
I'm here...

1:40:15.796 --> 1:40:16.832
Cool.

1:40:32.710 --> 1:40:35.989
I'm Ali Spencer, so
they told me.

1:40:37.611 --> 1:40:40.614
Uh... a while ago I got into
a pretty bad car accident

1:40:40.683 --> 1:40:42.892
and my long term memory is
totally swiped.

1:40:44.170 --> 1:40:46.931
It could be temporary but
it could be permanent.

1:40:48.036 --> 1:40:50.693
And I still don't know
everything about

1:40:50.762 --> 1:40:52.937
who Ali Spencer really
was but I'm not

1:40:53.006 --> 1:40:54.145
freaking out about it.

1:40:54.214 --> 1:40:56.976
I'm just moving forward
and trying to find

1:40:57.045 --> 1:40:59.771
out who I am now.

1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:01.601
And so, this is a poem
about all that.

1:41:01.670 --> 1:41:04.155
It's about a girl who
lost herself

1:41:04.224 --> 1:41:08.021
and maybe she never will
find the person she once was.

1:41:08.090 --> 1:41:11.231
But maybe she will find the
one she's suppose to be.

1:41:13.647 --> 1:41:15.822
It's called "The Mystery
of My History"

1:41:15.891 --> 1:41:19.067
and I'd like to dedicated
it to my friend, Cameron.

1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.485
It's easy to love the light...

1:41:23.554 --> 1:41:26.902
and what can be seen
in plain sight.

1:41:26.971 --> 1:41:28.835
It's much harder to
embrace the dark,

1:41:28.904 --> 1:41:30.940
no idea if you'll ever
hit your mark.

1:41:32.045 --> 1:41:33.564
You claim that the past is known

1:41:33.633 --> 1:41:35.048
and the future can't be seen,

1:41:35.117 --> 1:41:38.362
but I say history is a mystery

1:41:39.535 --> 1:41:42.400
and the future is where
we come clean...

1:41:48.648 --> 1:41:50.995
It's easy to love the light...

1:41:51.064 --> 1:41:52.376
And what can be...

1:42:26.651 --> 1:42:29.516
Dear Future Me... I
know sometimes

1:42:29.585 --> 1:42:33.037
you're probably feeling
like things are overwhelming

1:42:33.106 --> 1:42:36.834
but I've got great news for you.

1:42:36.903 --> 1:42:38.767
Have faith.

1:42:38.836 --> 1:42:41.942
Just remember, you are
capable of so much more

1:42:42.011 --> 1:42:44.531
than you even realize.

1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:47.189
Take the risks you're
afraid of taking,

1:42:47.258 --> 1:42:50.434
paint your picture boldly
across the universe.

1:42:51.297 --> 1:42:54.679
But most of all, love.

1:42:54.748 --> 1:42:58.027
Love exactly who you are,

1:42:58.097 --> 1:43:00.754
an amazing future is
awaiting you.
