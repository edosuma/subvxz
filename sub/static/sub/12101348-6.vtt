WEBVTT

00:13.179 --> 00:14.973
[panting, moaning]

00:16.141 --> 00:18.059
-Right there. Yeah.
-[Sheldon grunting]

00:18.143 --> 00:19.394
Don't stop. [panting]

00:19.477 --> 00:21.187
Don't stop. Don't stop.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.691
-That's it. Don't… don't…
-[garbled beeping]

00:24.774 --> 00:25.942
What? What?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.486
[panting] What? What?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.905
I'm picking up
radio anomalies outside Mars.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.825
It's a rogue comet. [grunting]

00:35.035 --> 00:36.494
[both panting]

00:39.831 --> 00:41.958
Mars's gravity
must have knocked it off course.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.376
It's headed towards Earth.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.503
Hey, can you pick up the dry cleaning
on the way home?

00:45.587 --> 00:46.755
[Sheldon] Yeah, of course.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.215
I'll make this up to you
when I get back. Love you.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.383
Mmm.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.431
Love you too.

02:09.796 --> 02:10.672
[chuckles]

02:58.428 --> 02:59.596
[indistinct chattering]

02:59.679 --> 03:02.724
I've slipped passengers
through English blockades.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.226
I've evaded privateers past the Rum Lines

03:05.310 --> 03:06.686
in the Gulf of Mexico.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.606
If it can be done in a ship,
I am the man to do it. But this…

03:11.357 --> 03:12.567
This I will not do.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.736
[splutters] Okay,
you haven't even heard our offer yet.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.988
Your offer is not worth the risk.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.031
Well, what kind of risk?

03:18.114 --> 03:20.950
Half a dozen ships have been lost there
in the last year alone.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.327
Lost how?

03:23.703 --> 03:26.247
Something beneath the waves, I've heard.

03:26.331 --> 03:30.710
Take any ship fool enough to venture there
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.172
You lot still fancy the Earth is flat?

03:34.672 --> 03:36.799
Believe you'll sail
off the edge and all that?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.593
I believe in two things,

03:39.427 --> 03:43.264
what I can see and what I can touch.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.266
Okay. Well…

03:46.976 --> 03:47.894
touch that.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.611
I am intrigued, but I am not touched.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.614
-Looks like you're not our guy then.
-No, no, no, George. George, let me--

03:59.697 --> 04:02.242
Shel, we'll get some other barnacle
with a pipe and a boat.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.118
He has to be the guy.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.246
Why?

04:10.458 --> 04:13.461
Because I heard
you are the best, Captain Borges.

04:13.544 --> 04:14.420
[Borges] Oh.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.297
-The best.
-[chuckles]

04:17.090 --> 04:18.675
-Wait. Just give us a minute.
-No, no, no.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.635
We can… we can talk. Okay. Whoa.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.428
-Whoa.
-[George] No. Put it--

04:22.512 --> 04:25.848
-[Sheldon] Hey!
-We seem to be at an impasse, Mr. Sampson.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.269
We can… Just… just have a seat.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.854
Does that break it?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.525
Or can we please all just go ahead
and shoot each other?

04:44.158 --> 04:45.410
Now I am touched.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.998
Okay. Okay.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.836
[Moroccan music playing]

04:54.919 --> 04:56.296
[indistinct chattering]

05:01.968 --> 05:03.511
Hey. Hey.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.556
So, I greased some of the locals

05:06.639 --> 05:09.559
with whatever the hell passes
for booze around here.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.437
-Okay.
-And it's true, what Borges said.

05:12.520 --> 05:17.692
Eight ships went missing in the last year,
right in the middle of where we're headed.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.069
The Great Old Ones.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.031
You ever read Lovecraft?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.533
That crazy nut from Providence?

05:25.616 --> 05:30.079
He's got these stories about ancient gods,
monsters living under the sea.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.291
If I spot one tentacle splashing around,
then I'm swimming home.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.208
[both chuckle]

05:34.292 --> 05:35.293
You and me both.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.464
And…

05:40.798 --> 05:44.385
do you think they knew
about the ships going missing?

05:45.511 --> 05:47.221
What do you mean, that was all of it?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.848
Don't get smart with me.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.392
I don't know.
It sure didn't seem to matter

05:51.476 --> 05:53.061
to Mr. Sampson, though, did it?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.028
[indistinct chattering]

06:11.037 --> 06:15.208
-Please tell me that's not our ride.
-Look at that piece of shit!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.585
How's it even staying afloat?

06:17.668 --> 06:19.045
It's gonna have to do.

06:20.171 --> 06:24.467
Hey, we're still missing
that other fella you swore we had to find.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.260
It don't add up, Shel.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.806
What's it say
about the rest of your whatever?

06:30.306 --> 06:31.182
[clock ticking]

06:36.396 --> 06:39.023
-Maybe he's on the ship.
-[Borges] Move, gentlemen. Move!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.237
Over here. Look alive.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.781
Welcome aboard, Mr. Sampson.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.284
She may not look like much,
but she's a fine old gal.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.994
-[indistinct shouting]
-[hammering]

06:52.078 --> 06:53.913
Uh, where's the rest of the crew?

06:53.996 --> 06:56.749
Well, most of them decided
to stay behind in Safi.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.710
I fear they did not care
for our destination.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.838
Now, your sidearms, if you please.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.881
I allow no guns on my ship.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.805
-Yeah, I don't feel comfortable--
-If you do not care for the terms…

07:17.145 --> 07:18.604
You heard the man. Hand 'em over.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.652
Haddo, see our guests to their quarters.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.737
[Haddo] Come on. Right this way.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.074
Mr. Welbeck, prime the engines
and cast off the stern lines.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.033
Aye, Captain.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.078
[in French] Did you hear the captain?
Moor the… Cast off the stern lines.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.038
[air horn blowing]

07:36.122 --> 07:37.582
[indistinct chattering]

07:40.626 --> 07:42.920
-How bad is it?
-We can handle it.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.922
Come on, Ruby. That's not what I asked.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.175
They're worked up, yeah,

07:47.258 --> 07:50.303
but, you know, any excuse
to be a bunch of assholes.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.930
[sighs] Shit!

07:56.559 --> 07:57.393
Hey, Ruby.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.520
Hey, Mrs. S.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.605
[panting]

08:02.690 --> 08:03.566
Call me later?

08:03.649 --> 08:04.484
[Brandon] Sure.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.361
-Bye, Mrs. S.
-Bye, Ruby.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.951
-So…
-[exhales deeply]

08:14.035 --> 08:15.286
…you and Ruby again, huh?

08:15.786 --> 08:17.955
I don't know. Maybe.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.084
She said things were tense
out in the field since Blackstar.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.504
It'll calm down.
It's just gonna take a little while.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.755
You doing the rounds?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.591
[Grace] Yeah. Should be back by dinner.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.176
You need some help?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.679
Your dad still wants you
to stay on the farm.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.432
I'm not doing any good here, Mom.
I need to get back out there.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.019
Look, I understand what you said
about us being better,

08:40.603 --> 08:43.397
about setting an example
for everyone else, but…

08:44.023 --> 08:44.941
[sighs]

08:46.526 --> 08:47.610
But what?

08:48.194 --> 08:51.280
But it never stops, Mom, the hate,

08:51.364 --> 08:53.699
people killing each other for no reason.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.536
What good is setting an example
if no one ever follows it?

08:58.287 --> 09:00.164
Because it's the right thing.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.168
Remember that.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.462
[sighs]

09:15.888 --> 09:17.890
[jazz music playing]

09:22.520 --> 09:25.022
She's a delicate vessel, Mr. Sampson.
Any faster--

09:25.106 --> 09:27.567
-A damned antique is what she is.
-[camera clicks]

09:30.987 --> 09:31.904
[camera clicks]

09:31.988 --> 09:34.323
I said the next time you come…
I told you I got the watch.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.659
-You told me to bring…
-[camera clicks]

09:36.742 --> 09:39.370
I said, "Next time--"
That's not what I said.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.080
Yes, it's not possible.

09:41.163 --> 09:41.998
[grunts]

09:45.084 --> 09:46.627
-Oh!
-Sorry.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.796
Somebody ought to put
a bell around your neck.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.673
And barbed wire around yours.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.426
-Help keep the natives away.
-[crew laughing]

09:54.427 --> 09:55.428
Is this your card?

09:55.511 --> 09:57.138
-[crewman] No.
-[chuckles]

09:57.221 --> 09:59.015
Hey, what's with your friend?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
He was talking to himself,
and it's not the first time either.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.603
I'm not listening to you. Just go.

10:03.686 --> 10:07.398
Oh, it's just Sheldon
working things out in his head.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.316
[Sheldon] Stop it.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.443
-You see the way they're looking at me?
-Huh.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.861
You know, there's a bunch of boats

10:11.944 --> 10:14.113
at the bottom of the sea
where we're headed…

10:15.406 --> 10:16.782
and he's doing the heading.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.953
[chuckles] Look, I've known Sheldon
my entire life, all right?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.998
The craziest thing the guy's ever done
is choose Northwestern over Harvard

10:24.081 --> 10:25.833
so he could see more Cubs' games.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.668
[chuckles]

10:28.794 --> 10:29.670
Yeah.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.548
[chuckles]

10:36.218 --> 10:37.053
Okay.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.847
[Sheldon] I promise you.
I promise you, there's no chance

10:39.930 --> 10:41.807
they're gonna do that to me.
There's no chance.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.726
No. Whatever they're-- It--

10:44.769 --> 10:45.686
Stop it!

10:46.687 --> 10:48.981
That's not what I said. I said you--

10:53.527 --> 10:54.362
[grunts]

10:59.617 --> 11:00.701
[Janna] Austin! Austin!

11:03.996 --> 11:06.540
His pulse is faint.
He's… he's barely breathing.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.542
-[grunting]
-Guys, he needs help!

11:08.626 --> 11:11.295
Okay, you're done!
You hear me? You are done!

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
-Light that bitch up!
-Oh, with pleasure.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.008
Say good night, asshole! [yells]

11:16.592 --> 11:18.177
Stop it! It's over!

11:18.260 --> 11:19.887
-Get out of the way, Janna!
-No!

11:19.970 --> 11:21.931
-Move!
-This isn't right!

11:26.310 --> 11:28.145
Screw it! I'm doing it! [yells]

11:30.481 --> 11:31.482
Stand down!

11:31.565 --> 11:33.192
He and Baryon ambushed us!

11:33.275 --> 11:36.487
-The fight was over! He was down!
-I was making sure that he stayed down!

11:36.570 --> 11:38.072
You don't get to make that call.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.782
Supposed to bend over and just take it?

11:41.283 --> 11:47.498
Lower your voice
and take two steps back. Now!

11:50.251 --> 11:51.377
Sorry, ma'am.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.296
It's just Baryon got away.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.925
We need to be better than they are, Jay,
now more than ever.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.302
Maybe.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.097
Maybe that's how it used to be.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.766
But now it's about not getting killed.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.853
What's the Union gonna do about that?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
[Sierra] Oh God.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.744
[Borges shouting indistinctly]

12:31.000 --> 12:33.377
-Shh. Come here. Come here.
-Well…

12:33.878 --> 12:35.463
[Sheldon speaking indistinctly]

12:35.546 --> 12:36.881
Just stop it!

12:38.340 --> 12:40.885
No. No. There has to be another way.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.431
People are starting to look at me funny
because of you.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.515
You won't leave me alone.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.186
-Who's in there with him?
-Nobody. I saw him go in alone.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.438
[Sheldon] …questions,
but I have to give them answers.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.192
Stop-- No, that's not a riddle.
I'm not asking you a riddle.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.985
I need to know, why are you doing this?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.867
He's not just talking to himself.
He's arguing, yelling.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.328
[Grace] Yeah. George said,
"That's just what Sheldon does."

13:07.411 --> 13:09.288
"His way of sorting his thoughts out."

13:09.371 --> 13:10.873
He was trying to sell it pretty hard.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.083
Hey, if your brother's off his nut,
we need to know.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.835
Hey, I don't wanna hear that, Fitz.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.880
He's been through a lot, no question,
but he's fine.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.215
No, he's not!

13:20.257 --> 13:21.133
We're done here.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.760
-Wait--
-No, no, no! Whoa!

13:23.636 --> 13:27.723
We're in the middle of the goddamn ocean,
and your brother is popping a stitch.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.308
[creaking]

13:38.317 --> 13:39.819
The engines have stopped.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.737
[suspenseful music playing]

13:49.453 --> 13:51.455
[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

13:53.374 --> 13:54.542
[alert buzzes]

13:56.293 --> 13:57.753
You know Jay was just upset?

13:57.837 --> 13:58.712
Mm-hmm.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.589
Austin was his best friend.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
Uh, is… is his best friend.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.386
And he's pissed that Baryon got away.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.388
[Grace] And how about you?
How are you holding up?

14:07.888 --> 14:08.848
[Janna] I'm doing good.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.101
[Grace] You know, you can tell me.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.770
It's okay.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.149
It's getting bad out there.
I've just never seen it like this before.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.862
Now, does the rest of your team
feel like Jay about the Code?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.698
Uh, I don't know. Um, maybe.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.870
[sighs] It's not as black and white
as it used to be.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.747
Well, isn't that even more of a reason
to stick to the Code,

14:33.831 --> 14:35.124
to help make things right?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.376
My Chloe used to say that.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.294
[chuckles]

14:39.169 --> 14:41.922
How is she, by the way?
I heard she's out of the hospital.

14:44.049 --> 14:44.925
What--

14:45.968 --> 14:46.844
The hospital?

14:47.761 --> 14:48.596
Um…

14:49.722 --> 14:51.849
[garbled beeping]

14:53.309 --> 14:56.312
Fitz is signaling. I have to go. Uh…

14:56.395 --> 14:58.647
I am so sorry.
I… I thought you knew, and--

14:58.731 --> 15:00.566
[Grace] No, it's not your fault.

15:02.109 --> 15:02.943
[sighs]

15:03.944 --> 15:04.778
Thank you.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.491
[Sheldon] Give me a timeline.
Give me some explanation--

15:09.575 --> 15:10.576
What happened to the engine?

15:10.659 --> 15:12.328
-[Walter] What's going on?
-The bilge pump went out.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.788
-What does that mean?
-[sighs] It means we're taking on water.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.958
-What? You didn't say anything about that.
-[sighs]

15:18.042 --> 15:20.753
This is a ship, Mr. Hutchence.
Water comes with the bargain.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.963
Yeah, but it's usually on the outside,
isn't it?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.590
How long before we get moving again?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.426
I have men on it,
but my engineer stayed behind in Safi.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.678
-We left port without an engineer?
-[sighs]

15:29.762 --> 15:31.138
I warned you about these waters,

15:31.221 --> 15:34.600
but you Americans do not listen
unless the devil--

15:34.683 --> 15:37.478
-You did this! You did this, didn't you?
-Whoa, whoa. Shel, Shel, Shel!

15:37.561 --> 15:39.813
-He did it.
-He's not gonna want his boat to go down.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.941
He's trying to squeeze
more money out of us.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.567
Get this ship moving now!

15:43.651 --> 15:46.278
You do not give the orders
on this ship, Mr. Sampson!

15:46.362 --> 15:50.032
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey.
The bilge pump, how do I get to it?

15:53.202 --> 15:54.036
Shel…

16:01.001 --> 16:03.462
[Welbeck] Come on, you bastard!

16:04.505 --> 16:05.339
[grunting]

16:05.923 --> 16:08.509
Hey. I heard you boys could use a hand.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.094
You heard wrong. We got it.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.595
[grunting]

16:11.679 --> 16:14.723
So you're just, uh, stalling
for dramatic effect, that it?

16:15.891 --> 16:17.518
What did you say, boy?

16:19.061 --> 16:20.604
Just making conversation.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.272
Yeah.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.566
[grunting]

16:25.859 --> 16:27.236
You got any detergent?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.198
If you wanna wash the shit
out of your drawers, do it topside.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.950
There's debris
obstructing the float switch

16:33.033 --> 16:34.159
and shutting down the pump.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.412
Detergent should loosen it up,
clear it out.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.664
[laughing]

16:38.747 --> 16:40.958
Well, that's the stupidest shit
I ever heard.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.420
You got a better idea, let's hear it.
If you don't, shut the hell up

16:44.503 --> 16:47.965
and get me some detergent from the galley
before we're all floating home, fat man.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.849
[grunts]

16:59.768 --> 17:00.686
[sighs]

17:01.812 --> 17:03.897
[both panting]

17:03.981 --> 17:05.607
-It ever bother you?
-What?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.777
You know, that we never go out.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.446
Hell, no.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.033
Don't you want me
to meet all your friends?

17:14.116 --> 17:16.243
-My friends are shit.
-[laughs]

17:16.326 --> 17:18.328
-What about yours, huh?
-What about them?

17:18.912 --> 17:19.747
[grunts]

17:19.830 --> 17:22.124
I don't see you busting your ass
to introduce me.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.917
Yeah, you kinda kicked
the shit out of them

17:24.001 --> 17:25.586
when we hit you with our van, so…

17:25.669 --> 17:28.672
-[laughing] Shit. Sorry.
-[chuckles]

17:28.756 --> 17:31.508
-But they kind of had it coming, okay?
-[exhales deeply]

17:34.053 --> 17:37.264
Okay, hold on. I gotta hit the head.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.932
Seriously?

17:39.016 --> 17:40.934
[chuckles] I'll just be a second.

17:41.935 --> 17:42.853
[grunts]

17:43.353 --> 17:44.271
[giggles]

17:44.354 --> 17:45.522
Start without me.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.862
[chuckles]

17:59.453 --> 18:00.370
Mom.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.499
[whispers] What are you doing here?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.878
-You weren't answering your phone.
-It broke… kind of.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.589
Chloe, why didn't you tell me
you were in the hospital?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.133
It was nothing.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.885
-Did he have something to do with it?
-Mom.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.763
He is the son of Skyfox.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.933
And he's not like his dad,
just like I'm not like mine.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.146
All right. You're an adult.
You can see whoever you want.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.898
But just know that--

18:27.981 --> 18:30.692
Everything I do reflects
on the family and the Union.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.321
Do you know how many times
Dad said that, growing up?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.823
You sound just like him.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.409
-Chloe, your father--
-Don't. Don't make excuses for him.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.203
-I'm not.
-Bullshit.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.705
You always take his side.

18:44.706 --> 18:48.961
Don't you ever have
any thoughts that aren't his?

18:49.044 --> 18:50.712
That's not fair.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.214
[scoffs]

18:53.048 --> 18:56.301
That's exactly what he said
when I called him out on all his shit.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.262
[toilet flushing]

18:58.345 --> 18:59.471
Okay, so, do you mind?

18:59.555 --> 19:03.183
I don't want the guy I'm dating
to see my mom creeping outside my window.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.649
I love you.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.613
[man laughing]

19:17.322 --> 19:18.240
[sighs]

19:18.323 --> 19:20.993
Never heard nobody talk
to Welbeck like that.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.414
I'm not looking to start anything.
Just trying to get us moving again.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.916
You weren't just having him on
about the detergent?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.793
No. Read it in a book.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.005
You read books about bilge pumps?

19:33.714 --> 19:37.801
[chuckles] I… I read about everything.
It's the only way in my country

19:37.885 --> 19:40.304
a guy who looks like me
can imagine doing everything

19:40.387 --> 19:43.849
without some asshole like Welbeck
telling you you can't,

19:43.932 --> 19:46.810
'cause he thinks the color of his skin
makes him king of the damn world.

19:46.894 --> 19:52.900
You, uh, talk to men like him
the way you did back in America?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.067
[scoffs]

19:54.151 --> 19:55.903
Get my ass fired if I did…

19:57.404 --> 19:58.530
or a lot worse.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.452
Stay here, then. Huh? Work here.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.205
-Uh, fix shit, from your books.
-[chuckles]

20:06.288 --> 20:07.623
[laughs]

20:07.706 --> 20:09.166
Screw with Welbeck some more.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.375
[both laughing]

20:11.793 --> 20:12.628
Uh…

20:14.171 --> 20:17.424
You know, America can be a heap of shit
for me and mine.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.218
It's got a history of it.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.511
But it's my heap of shit, you know?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.182
And the only way to clean it up
is to get my hands dirty.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.266
[grunts]

20:30.020 --> 20:33.482
Do you really think Walter can get inside
of what's left of his brain?

20:34.191 --> 20:37.611
It's not gonna be easy.
Half his gray matter got scrambled.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.196
Brandon didn't hold back.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.282
-How's Austin?
-Petra's with him.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.326
He's gonna lose the eye,
but he'll make it.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.912
They're looking to even the score
out on the street,

20:46.995 --> 20:48.747
using Blackstar as a flash point.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.668
-Yeah, Petra told me the same.
-It's just whipping the younger heroes up.

20:52.751 --> 20:57.005
If Ghost Beam hadn't stepped in,
Vulcaner would have killed that asshole.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.675
Well, maybe he deserved it.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.099
Do you really believe that?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.893
This world
is not like it used to be, Grace.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.563
-Don't tell me you don't see it.
-[Grace] Of course I see it, Fitz.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.107
My son took a life.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.278
I mean, he turned against
everything we taught him,

21:19.945 --> 21:21.071
and he took a life.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.598
[crew shouting indistinctly]

22:34.102 --> 22:35.020
[door opens]

22:35.103 --> 22:36.563
[Grace shrieks] Oh, God!

22:41.526 --> 22:42.402
What are you doing?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.200
[Walter] What is this?

22:51.328 --> 22:52.662
What is this, Shel?

23:00.003 --> 23:01.004
What else?

23:02.422 --> 23:03.924
What else you been hiding from me?

23:10.472 --> 23:11.681
This is Dad's watch.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.600
We…

23:14.643 --> 23:16.019
We buried him with it.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.856
What did you do, Shel?

23:19.940 --> 23:22.692
Go ahead. Tell 'em.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.612
-What did you do?
-Give me the watch.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.323
-What did you do, Shel? What did you do?
-Give me the watch!

23:28.407 --> 23:30.367
-Stop it! Stop it!
-What did you do?

23:30.450 --> 23:32.119
[Grace] Stop it! Stop it!

23:32.202 --> 23:35.080
-[crew shouting indistinctly]
-Hey. What's going on out there?

23:35.163 --> 23:37.499
I don't know.
Something's got 'em worked up. Come on.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.251
[alert buzzing]

23:39.334 --> 23:41.336
[crew continues shouting indistinctly]

23:46.258 --> 23:47.884
[panting]

23:49.010 --> 23:50.387
-[grunting]
-Pull!

23:51.471 --> 23:52.806
Pull him up!

23:53.515 --> 23:55.725
-[crew shouting indistinctly]
-Is he alive?

23:57.310 --> 23:58.854
Come on, mate. Come on.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.189
[crew speaking indistinctly]

24:01.273 --> 24:02.524
[Borges] Blankets!

24:02.607 --> 24:04.025
Come on now! Come on!

24:06.611 --> 24:07.863
Give him room!

24:11.116 --> 24:12.826
Walt, it's him.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.495
Walt, it's him!

24:16.204 --> 24:17.330
You know that guy?

24:17.414 --> 24:20.542
No, but I've been waiting for him.
[panting] He's the last one.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.170
We're all here now.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.798
We're all here.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.304
What were you doing in the water
in the middle of nowhere?

24:32.387 --> 24:36.933
[panting] Volunteer mission.
International Committee of the Red Cross.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.895
-You're a doctor?
-Surgeon.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.522
Richard. Dr. Richard Conrad.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.401
We were at sea for maybe a week.

24:47.486 --> 24:53.200
Nothing but… but glass on the water.
You know, blue skies everywhere you turn.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.369
-We never saw it coming.
-[splutters] "It"? What do you mean, "It"?

24:56.453 --> 24:59.664
The storm. It… it was…
it was all of a sudden there.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.166
It rose from the sea.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.627
…it was on us. Oh, the wind came up.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.171
-We… we… we tried to go…
-We tried to go around it.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.048
…you know, or just out of it. But…

25:08.131 --> 25:10.008
-But iffen we turned…
-Every time we adjusted course…

25:10.091 --> 25:12.093
-…it turned.
-[Richard] …it just…

25:12.761 --> 25:15.764
-It knew…
-…what we were thinking. Like it was…

25:15.847 --> 25:16.848
…comes alive!

25:17.432 --> 25:18.934
Ain't you been listening?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.394
Like it was alive.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.605
[grunts]

25:26.441 --> 25:28.193
And then, all of a sudden…

25:29.569 --> 25:30.862
It took them.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.239
…the world went upside down.

25:33.823 --> 25:34.658
It took them.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.579
No. Why did it let me live?

25:39.663 --> 25:40.956
-[thunder crashing]
-[Grace gasps]

25:44.251 --> 25:46.503
-[rumbling]
-[Grace gasps] Whoa!

25:47.629 --> 25:48.755
It found me.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.132
Oh, God. It's here.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.009
It found me.

25:53.593 --> 25:54.636
It found me.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.596
It found me!

25:56.680 --> 25:57.973
[rumbling]

26:01.851 --> 26:02.686
[Grace gasps]

26:05.188 --> 26:06.356
[exhales sharply]

26:08.692 --> 26:10.402
[thunder crashing]

26:13.363 --> 26:16.116
Engine room, we're turning back!
Emergency astern!

26:16.199 --> 26:17.701
-No! No!
-Turn back!

26:17.784 --> 26:20.161
-Mr. Sampson, get a hold of yourself!
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

26:20.245 --> 26:22.414
-[all clamoring]
-Hey, hey, hey! No!

26:22.497 --> 26:25.041
-No! No! Stop it!
-Stop!

26:25.125 --> 26:26.918
We gotta keep going! We gotta keep going!

26:27.002 --> 26:28.920
-Take it easy!
-Get him out of here!

26:29.004 --> 26:30.630
-Listen to me! Listen to me!
-Shel! Shel!

26:30.714 --> 26:33.174
-He was in the cellar in Kansas!
-Kansas?

26:33.258 --> 26:36.136
Yes! That proves that this is real!
It's all real!

26:36.219 --> 26:39.264
-I… I… I've never been to Kansas.
-Yes, you were! Yes, you were!

26:39.347 --> 26:42.017
You were there. You were all… you were…

26:42.100 --> 26:43.226
-You were all there!
-Shel…

26:45.937 --> 26:47.564
-I had a vision.
-Oh, Christ.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.400
I tried to tell you about it.
I'm not crazy! We can't run from it!

26:50.483 --> 26:52.652
Just like Miller said,
just like Richard said.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.779
-We gotta go straight through it!
-Shel. Shel.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.948
If we try to run from it,
we're all gonna die!

26:57.032 --> 26:57.949
We're all gonna die!

26:58.033 --> 27:00.910
-We've gotta go through it!
-I'm sorry. This is my fault.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.705
I should never have let
George talk me into this.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.999
-Wait a minute. I never said--
-I told you he was sick!

27:06.082 --> 27:08.627
No, you didn't! You sat in that chair
and said he was fine!

27:08.710 --> 27:11.087
-I told you they'd turn on you.
-Shut up!

27:11.171 --> 27:13.173
[muted] You lied, you lousy little shit!

27:13.256 --> 27:15.842
-What was I supposed to do?
-[Grace] You lied! You lied!

27:15.925 --> 27:18.428
-Captain, get us out of the storm.
-No!

27:18.511 --> 27:19.429
[yelling]

27:19.512 --> 27:23.391
You just gotta do what I told you…
you just gotta do… back in your cabin.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.769
Get out of my head! Get out of my head!

27:26.645 --> 27:28.980
[groans] Get out of my head!

27:30.106 --> 27:31.483

-Shel? Who are you talking to?
-[Sheldon whimpering]

27:36.196 --> 27:38.990
You saw the drawings, the watch.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.241
[Sheldon panting]

27:40.325 --> 27:41.951
Shel, are you talking to Dad?

27:43.286 --> 27:44.120
He's…

27:45.997 --> 27:47.624
-He's here.
-[Walter] Shel?

27:47.707 --> 27:48.875
[sobbing] He's here.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.797
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[Sheldon whimpers] He's here.

27:55.048 --> 27:58.259
-Did you know about this?
-No. He didn't tell me about this one.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.721
It's all real, Walt. It's all real.
You have to believe me.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.473
[Walter] Shh. Okay.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.017
[Sheldon panting, groaning]

28:06.518 --> 28:08.478
Hey, take him to his cabin.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.480
Shel, just wait there.

28:10.563 --> 28:12.565
-Nice and easy, mate.
-Whoa! No, no, no!

28:12.649 --> 28:14.776
Take it easy on him, all right?
That's not necessary.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.819
Get him out of here!

28:15.902 --> 28:17.237
-Come on.
-Get the gun out of here.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.363
Don't turn it around.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.324
-Let's go.
-We have to keep going. He was there!

28:21.408 --> 28:23.451
[Borges] I want someone outside his door.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.998
Okay. Okay.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.815
Commander, what's the sitrep?

28:53.898 --> 28:57.235
Some asshole tore up half the block.
Ghost Beam chased him inside.

28:57.318 --> 29:00.238
-I think he's part of Blackstar's crew.
-Copy that.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.575
You keep that perimeter locked down.
I'm gonna back her up inside.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.536
Yes, ma'am. Let's go. All units,

Everything okay?

33:48.776 --> 33:51.821
Uh, well, the planet's still here.
So, yeah, I guess so.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.407
[Grace] Thanks.

It's just not as easy

[sighs] I'm gonna have to bring Brandon
with me next time.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.632

-[Sheldon] Yeah.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.469
So, what did I miss while I was gone?

34:15.386 --> 34:17.555
Uh… I saw Chloe.

[Grace] I, um…

37:19.612 --> 37:20.821
it doesn't matter.

37:22.365 --> 37:26.285
It… it doesn't matter if it's real or not,
because it's real to you.

37:26.369 --> 37:29.080
She's playing you,
just like they played Miller.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.958
You don't wanna do this. This isn't
the way forward. It's the way down.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.292
You gotta listen to her, Shel!

37:33.376 --> 37:34.835

Kill all of 'em before it's too late!
