01:04.313 --> 01:06.816
Hey, Doc! Check out
the painting I made!

01:07.400 --> 01:08.318
What is it?

01:09.027 --> 01:12.030
It's an elephant
eating blueberries.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.282
Hmm. [laughs]

01:14.574 --> 01:16.743
I'm going to go
show Mom and Dad!

01:28.671 --> 01:32.175
Hi, Doc!
It's baa-utiful to see you!

01:32.258 --> 01:34.636
It's beautiful
to see you too, Lambie.

01:38.097 --> 01:41.518
Hello! It's Glo-Bo!

01:41.601 --> 01:42.852
Glo-Bo!

01:43.561 --> 01:49.192
Yo! What's squeakin'
with my favorite

01:50.193 --> 01:51.945

How's the surf!

Uh... you got me, Glo-Bo.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.541
You are, buddy!

02:04.624 --> 02:07.001
Ho, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:07.085 --> 02:08.752
okay, all right.
Uh, thanks, Glo-Bo.

02:09.169 --> 02:12.715
Hmm, it's sunny today.
I hope I don't melt.

02:12.799 --> 02:17.762
Chilly! My man!
My main man! My snowman!

02:18.138 --> 02:22.350
You are
the coolest snowman I know!
It's so great to see you.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.268
[groaning]

02:23.810 --> 02:25.854
Good to see you, Mr. Crab!

02:27.230 --> 02:28.565
Come on, give me five.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.860
I think I broke a bone
when Glo-Bo hugged me.

02:31.943 --> 02:37.532
But, Chilly,
you don't have any bones.
You're a snowman!

02:37.907 --> 02:41.536
Oh. Yeah, right.
[chuckles] Thanks, Doc.

02:41.619 --> 02:45.331
[gasps] Chilly!
You've got blue spots
on your back.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.585
What? Blue spots?
Where? I don't see 'em!

02:48.668 --> 02:50.712
Where are they?
I don't see 'em!

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
Doc! There's nothing wrong,
is there?

02:53.798 --> 02:57.927
[stammers] I mean,
blue spots are normal
for a snowman, right?

02:58.469 --> 03:01.931
No, Chilly.
I'm sorry. They're not.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.768
Wait! You mean,
there's actually

03:05.852 --> 03:08.104
something wrong
with Chilly this time?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.940
Okay. What's wrong?

03:11.232 --> 03:14.903
Calm down, Chilly.
I don't know yet,
but I will.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.864
So, let's take you in
for a check-up.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.825
[stammering] A check-up?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.952
I've never had
one of those before!

03:23.369 --> 03:26.748
That's because
there was never anything
wrong with you before.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.207
Oh!

03:32.879 --> 03:34.172
The Doc is in!

03:36.257 --> 03:38.593
Well, hello there, Doc!
Got a patient?

03:39.135 --> 03:42.597

Chilly! That's because
you're wearing a scarf.

And, also, I can't feel
the top of my head!

04:40.989 --> 04:42.949

04:43.366 --> 04:45.118
See that?
She knows what's wrong.

04:45.660 --> 04:50.915
My diagnosis is,
you have a case
of Mystery Pox!

04:51.332 --> 04:55.670
[gasps] Mystery Pox? Oh, no!
Anything but Mystery Pox!

04:56.337 --> 04:58.423
Uh... I don't know
what Mystery Pox are.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.802
Nobody does.
That's why they're a mystery.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.805
You don't even
know what they are?

05:06.222 --> 05:07.682
Chilly, chill!

05:08.016 --> 05:11.436
Doc's the best
toy doctor there is!
She'll figure it out.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.271
Hoppin' horsefeathers, Doc.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.482
I hate to interrupt
your check-up, but you have
another patient.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.525
I do?

05:17.608 --> 05:18.443
[squeaking]

05:18.526 --> 05:19.819
[all] Squeakers?

05:21.029 --> 05:21.946
[Doc gasps]

05:22.405 --> 05:24.198
You've got Mystery Pox too!

05:24.282 --> 05:25.116
[both gasp]

05:25.199 --> 05:28.369
This is horrible!
Two cases of Mystery Pox!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.955
[honking]
Are Mystery Pox blue spots?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.417
[Buddy] Because we've got
these blue spotty
thingies on us, too!

05:34.500 --> 05:36.377
This is horrible!

05:36.627 --> 05:37.754
[gasps]

05:38.963 --> 05:40.256
I got you, sugar.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.717
Hallie! Let me
see your hands!

05:45.261 --> 05:49.057
You touched Chilly,
and now you have
Mystery Pox, too!

05:49.140 --> 05:50.141
[all gasp]

05:50.224 --> 05:52.977
Merciful meerkats!
You're right!

05:53.061 --> 05:57.398
Oh, I'm sorry, Hallie.
I didn't mean
to give you Mystery Pox.

05:57.815 --> 06:01.027
Oh, Chilly, you look like
you need a cuddle.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.864
Oh, I do!
I do need a cuddle!

06:05.948 --> 06:06.824
Lambie, wait!

06:07.325 --> 06:10.953
Huh? Doc, you shouldn't keep
a lamb from a cuddle.

06:11.370 --> 06:15.333
I know,
but Hallie got Mystery Pox
when she touched Chilly.

06:15.583 --> 06:19.045
Which means it can spread
from toy to toy
just by touching.

06:19.378 --> 06:23.299
So, if you cuddle with Chilly,
you might catch
Mystery Pox, too!

06:24.592 --> 06:26.094
[squeaking]

06:26.427 --> 06:27.553
[sighs]

06:27.637 --> 06:29.680
Is this the end of cuddles?

06:30.098 --> 06:33.476
No. We'll figure out
the mystery of Mystery Pox.

06:33.559 --> 06:38.231
But until we do,
I'm ordering a cuddle ban.

06:39.357 --> 06:43.402
That means no cuddling
'til we figure out
what's going on!

06:43.486 --> 06:46.447
Lambie,
I got my eyes on you.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.576
The Mystery Pox
are spreading

06:50.660 --> 06:54.622
sort of like germs spread
from person to person.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.583
Maybe there are
Mystery Pox germs, too.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.336
Oh, no, not germs!

07:00.419 --> 07:03.047
[groans] Aah!
I don't want germs!

07:04.132 --> 07:06.300
Uh, what are germs again?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.887
Germs are tiny living things
that can make you sick.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.723
They can pass
from person to person

07:12.807 --> 07:14.434
when you touch
someone who's sick.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.271
That's why it's important
to wash your hands
especially when you're sick.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.106
That's right,
Nurse Hallie.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.651
So, if we want to get
to the bottom of this,

07:23.734 --> 07:26.487
we need to find out
who's spreading germs!

07:26.988 --> 07:31.534
Hallie, we know that
you got Mystery Pox
after you touched Chilly.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.119
Now, Chilly.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.707
Can you think of who
might have touched you
and given you the germs?

07:38.249 --> 07:39.959
Uh... oh!

07:40.042 --> 07:42.086
Glo-Bo gave me a big hug!

07:42.170 --> 07:44.338
I thought he broke my bones,
remember?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.715
That's right.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.843
What about you,
Surfer Girl?

07:48.926 --> 07:52.346
Anyone you can think of
who might have
given you germs?

07:52.763 --> 07:53.848
Oh...

07:54.265 --> 07:57.810
Glo-Bo patted me
on the back when he
laughed at my joke!

07:57.894 --> 08:01.230
Hey, come to think about it,
Glo-Bo touched me too.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.778
If this picture is right,

08:07.862 --> 08:12.658
it looks like a lot of you
got Mystery Pox germs from...

08:13.618 --> 08:14.702
[all] Glo-Bo!

08:15.119 --> 08:18.998
We have to find Glo-Bo
before he spreads
germs to everyone!

08:19.874 --> 08:24.045
You are
the fuzziest bear I know!
Bring it in for a hug!

08:24.712 --> 08:27.465
Brr! Glo-Bo! Brr!

08:27.548 --> 08:29.300
Stop that bear hug!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.385
[stuttering]
What's wrong, Doc?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.722
There's a bad case
of Mystery Pox
going around.

08:34.804 --> 08:37.433
I think you're spreading it
to all the toys!

08:38.017 --> 08:40.727
No, I don't want
to make my friends sick!

08:41.437 --> 08:44.190
That's funny.
You don't seem to have
Mystery Pox.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.566
[sighs loudly]

08:45.858 --> 08:47.652
That is a relief!

08:48.402 --> 08:50.905
Glo-Bo gave himself
Mystery Pox!

08:51.572 --> 08:54.075
I got it!
Can I see your hands?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.618
Sure thing, Doc.

08:56.953 --> 08:57.828
Hmm...

08:58.162 --> 09:01.624
Oh, no! Now Doc
has Mystery Pox, too.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.084
[gasps] No!
Doc!

09:03.626 --> 09:07.046
I don't think so.
These dots aren't
Mystery Pox.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
They're paint!

09:09.257 --> 09:10.258
[all] Paint?

09:10.675 --> 09:15.137
Oh, yeah! I forgot!
Donny was using me
to finger paint.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.057
He said he was
painting an elephant
eating blueberries.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.935
[chuckles]
He dipped my fingers
in the blue paint

09:21.018 --> 09:23.896
and spread the paint
all over the paper with them.

09:24.438 --> 09:28.693
Glo-Bo hasn't
been spreading germs.
He's been spreading paint!

09:28.776 --> 09:30.903
Spreading paint?
How did I do that?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.072
All that hugging
and high-fiving.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.742
Whenever you touched
someone with your hands,
you got paint on them!

09:36.826 --> 09:38.494
Oh, oh, oh...

09:39.328 --> 09:41.789
I'm sorry I caused
so much trouble, Doc!

09:42.123 --> 09:43.583
It's okay, Glo-Bo.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.877
But it's important
to remember
to wash your hands

09:46.961 --> 09:48.838
so you don't
spread germs.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.631
[chuckles] Or paint!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.217
Let's go wash my hands
right now!

09:55.761 --> 09:59.473
Be sure to wash
your hands well.
That's really important!

22:46.490 --> 22:49.910
to tell us that he's saying
thank you... to me.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.704
[quacks softly]
He's saying
thank you to Doc!
