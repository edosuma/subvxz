01:00.460 --> 01:04.129
Hi, I'm Michael.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.832
Paul.

01:08.635 --> 01:11.837
I hear you're
having some trouble.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.842
It's okay.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.678
It's okay.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.781
I just...

01:22.783 --> 01:25.751
Don't understand...

01:25.753 --> 01:29.154
Why god made me like this.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.223
He didn't.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.292
Trust me.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.395
Let me tell you something.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.397
You should never
define yourself

01:38.399 --> 01:40.833
by your choices
or your desires.

01:40.835 --> 01:46.438
Gay doesn't exist.
It's a false identity.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.542
This isn't my choice.
Why would I choose this?

01:50.544 --> 01:53.245
You always have a choice.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.117
You wanna go to heaven, right?

01:58.119 --> 01:59.218
Yes.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.886
If you're
a moral person,

02:00.888 --> 02:04.323
then you'll choose
heterosexuality

02:04.325 --> 02:07.126
in order to be with god.

02:41.928 --> 02:42.895
Hey.

02:42.897 --> 02:43.862
Hey. Hey.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.930
Where you going?

02:44.932 --> 02:47.299
I'm gonna make us breakfast.

02:47.301 --> 02:47.933
No.

02:47.935 --> 02:48.734
Yeah, come on.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.570
Breakfast
is the most important part
of the day.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.306
I'll have muffins
at my meeting.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.807
Muffins?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.876
Yeah, muffins.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.278
Blueberry.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
Mmm, blueberry.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.583
Okay, then we'll
do lunch, okay?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.418
Mmm, morning breath.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.856
Oh, stop it!
Get off!

03:50.763 --> 03:53.265
It's so cool
that you work at <i> XY.</i>

03:53.267 --> 03:53.966
Yeah. Yeah, it's rad.

03:53.968 --> 03:58.270
You guys are like
the only cool gay magazine
out there right now.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.439
Oh, yeah, sort of.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.433
Hey, listen up, queens.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.470
<i> XY</i> magazine is taking over!

04:31.472 --> 04:33.705
It's our time to shine!

05:01.501 --> 05:03.902
<i> Matthew Shepard</i>
<i> was an openly gay man.</i>

05:03.904 --> 05:07.306
<i> When he went to a laramie,</i>
<i> Wyoming bar last week,</i>

05:07.308 --> 05:09.708
<i> these two suspects</i>
<i> lured him outside,</i>

05:09.710 --> 05:10.742
<i> pretending to be gay.</i>

05:10.744 --> 05:13.078
<i> Now they're charged</i>
<i> with a vicious attack</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:14.846
<i> that left Shepard</i>
<i> hanging on this fence</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:17.316
<i> for 18 hours</i>
<i> in freezing temperatures.</i>

05:17.318 --> 05:20.485
<i> Shepard remained on</i>
<i> life support until this morning</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:21.486
<i> when he passed away.</i>

05:21.488 --> 05:24.356
<i> Shepard's family</i>
<i> is grateful for support</i>

05:24.358 --> 05:26.391
<i> from around the world.</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:38.470
They killed him
because they were afraid,

05:38.472 --> 05:41.873
and they were afraid
because of what
their churches tell them

05:41.875 --> 05:44.543
and because of what
they see in movies.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.777
It's fucking ridiculous.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.112
I hope they get
the death penalty.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.915
You're against
the death penalty.
Not in this case.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.083
That's like being
for free speech

05:51.085 --> 05:53.819
until someone tells you
something that pisses you off.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.619
He died a slow death

05:54.621 --> 05:56.888
after being tied to a fence
and tortured.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.590
Exactly, a slow death
is way more painful.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.726
They should spend the rest
of their lives in prison.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.695
Okay, look, we need
to move away from labels

06:03.697 --> 06:06.698
because they segment
and they lead to persecution.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.869
People don't wanna be
perceived as gay because...

06:10.871 --> 06:13.872
They're afraid
they'll end up like Matthew.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.540
But we are a gay magazine.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.676
Identifying as gay
is being part of a community.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.077
It's recognition,
it's progress...

06:19.079 --> 06:22.948
We've been telling the kids
in the magazine to come out,
to be proud to be gay.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.616
They should be proud
to be themselves.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.120
Gay and straight
are just social constructs.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.122
Ugh. God,
you and your queer theory.

06:30.124 --> 06:33.859
Class is in session
with professor Michael glatze.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.826
Shut up.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.061
Okay, okay, look.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.429
We need to put out the message

06:37.431 --> 06:39.898
that being attracted
to the same sex

06:39.900 --> 06:43.535
doesn't define who you are.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.079
Hey.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.916
Have you been smoking?

06:58.551 --> 06:59.551
Just one.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.619
Small one.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.788
It was a small cigarette.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.792
Busted.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.061
Letters to the editor.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.965
Ninety percent
are some poor teen
with religious parents.

07:13.967 --> 07:18.870
Fucking Christian
fundamentalists
should burn in hell.

07:19.739 --> 07:20.772
Uh, okay.

07:20.774 --> 07:25.110
In the meantime,
there is a design competition

07:25.112 --> 07:28.180
for the halifax
international airport.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.481
I don't wanna move
to halifax.

07:29.483 --> 07:33.018
I know, but my father
wants me to head up
the bid committee.

07:33.020 --> 07:33.985
It's huge.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.821
Halifax is so boring.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.756
Your hometown is boring.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.690
It's not.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.458
Olympia?
Yeah.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.528
It's all trees
and fog and coffee.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.130
And the birthplace
of the riot grrrl movement

07:45.132 --> 07:49.134
and where Kurt cobain
wrote most of <i> nevermind.</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:50.769
Oh, well...

07:50.771 --> 07:52.571
Yeah.
In that case...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.206
But it's
unsustainable here,

07:54.208 --> 07:55.874
unless you're in
the dot-com movement,

07:55.876 --> 08:00.745
and I don't wanna live
in a studio on mission street

08:00.747 --> 08:01.847
when we're 50.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.714
Well, we won't be.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.985
We'll be in a big mansion
on a hill. Duh.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.623
<i> May 21st, 2000.</i>

08:11.625 --> 08:13.859
<i> I used to imagine myself</i>
<i> growing old</i>

08:13.861 --> 08:17.195
<i> while living in a house</i>
<i> atop a hill in the Castro,</i>

08:17.197 --> 08:18.663
<i> but what's more important to me</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:21.933
<i> is growing old</i>
<i> with the love of my life:</i>

08:21.935 --> 08:22.667
<i> Bennett.</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:24.769
<i> So I'm leaving San Francisco</i>

08:24.771 --> 08:26.805
<i> to live in halifax, Canada.</i>

08:26.807 --> 08:29.541
<i> Although I'm sad</i>
<i> to leave</i> XY <i> magazine,</i>

08:29.543 --> 08:32.711
<i> I'm excited to finally accept</i>
<i> the speaking offers</i>

08:32.712 --> 08:34.279
<i> I've been receiving</i>
<i> this past year,</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:37.682
<i> thanks to my work</i>
<i> as a writer and activist.</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:39.784
What a lot of people
aren't aware of

08:39.785 --> 08:42.687
is that the terms "heterosexual"
and "homosexual"

08:42.688 --> 08:46.191
were only introduced
about a hundred years ago.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.661
<i> As my mother</i>
<i> used to always say,</i>

08:49.663 --> 08:50.829
<i> "when you help others,</i>

08:50.831 --> 08:52.264
<i> you're helping yourself</i>
<i> as well."</i>

08:52.266 --> 08:54.866
We often read about
more sexually...

08:54.868 --> 08:56.701
<i> My goal is to thread a needle</i>

08:56.703 --> 08:58.537
<i> through the fabric</i>
<i> of this country</i>

08:58.539 --> 09:03.108
<i> and stitch together the lives</i>
<i> of gay kids everywhere.</i>

09:03.110 --> 09:03.975
I know a lot of you

09:03.977 --> 09:06.912
are balancing religion
and sexuality,

09:06.914 --> 09:08.046
but I mean, come on,

09:08.048 --> 09:13.618
what god would punish you
for finding love?

10:04.637 --> 10:08.373
This is where I spread
my mom's ashes.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.156
Oh, my god.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.926
She's still here.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.409
Mom, I'm gonna
stay here with you.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.243
No.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.077
Don't be stubborn.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.714
You are not skipping
a semester to be with me.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.216
I can help you through this.

10:51.218 --> 10:55.220
I'm gonna be fine.
I told you.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.789
I feel better.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.358
Really, Michael.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.796
I am so proud of you.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.899
I love you so much.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.835
Hmm. I love you.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.780
I should've stayed.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.249
Everyone kept saying,

11:24.251 --> 11:29.888
"don't worry, we're praying
for her, don't worry."

11:32.792 --> 11:35.126
Everyone's gonna die.

11:36.462 --> 11:40.832
No amount of praying
is ever gonna change that.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.754
You're not getting up yet.
Five minutes more.

12:02.756 --> 12:06.257
<i> I can't believe I'm approaching</i>
<i> my one-year anniversary</i>

12:06.259 --> 12:09.127
<i> here in halifax,</i>
<i> Nova Scotia, Canada.</i>

12:09.129 --> 12:13.131
<i> The food is amazing,</i>
<i> especially the Sushi.</i>

12:13.133 --> 12:18.369
<i> The people are friendly</i>
<i> and although the gay community</i>

12:18.371 --> 12:19.904
<i> is much smaller</i>
<i> than San Francisco,</i>

12:19.906 --> 12:24.843
<i> I have some big plans</i>
<i> to really make an impact.</i>

12:36.155 --> 12:38.757
What's wrong with you?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.191
Nothing.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.928
Look, I have to find
something else to do.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.899
I'm just not cut out
for administrative work.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.768
Give it some time?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.369
I have things
i wanna do.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.072
I want my own magazine.
I want something bigger.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.774
I want...
I want to influence people.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.009
I can't do that here.
You're being such a shit.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.345
We made the decision
to leave San Francisco together.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.179
No, we didn't.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.413
I mean,
you had to take this job.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.883
Just like you had
to take the job
that took us to San Francisco.

13:04.885 --> 13:10.388
Which is how you got
your job at <i> XY,</i>
so you should be thanking me.

13:12.158 --> 13:12.924
Is this...

13:12.926 --> 13:15.059
This is supposed to be
Mexican food?

13:15.061 --> 13:17.996
Why don't you go to the store
and make your own food?

13:17.998 --> 13:18.563
Maybe I will.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.165
You'll have to ask me
for money, though,

13:20.167 --> 13:23.468
'cause you don't have any,
remember?

13:37.983 --> 13:39.250
Thanks.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.446
Hey.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.249
Hey.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.484
You're Mike, right?

14:14.220 --> 14:15.386
Uh, yeah.

14:15.388 --> 14:20.225
The <i> XY</i> survivor guide
really helped me out.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.427
Are you stalking me
or something?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.597
Tyler.

14:25.599 --> 14:26.598
Hi.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.265
Hi.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.868
I just...
I wanted you to know

14:29.870 --> 14:31.636
I agree with everything
that you say

14:31.638 --> 14:34.305
about gay identity
and sexuality.

14:34.307 --> 14:39.110
I don't wanna be
put into a box
just because I'm gay.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.079
You don't wanna be in a box?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.348
No, I don't wanna be in a box.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.585
You're so fucking cute.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.454
Can I buy you a drink?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.489
Don't you have a boyfriend?

14:51.491 --> 14:56.527
Hmm...
He'll think you're cute, too.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.477
It's a galaxy.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.513
Uh, actually it's a spiral.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.949
It's the only symbol
that means anything.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.451
It's infinite,
no beginning, no end.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.687
There's a beginning
and there's an end.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.622
All right, well, there's
a more complicated one

15:57.624 --> 15:58.957
that has no beginning
and no end,

15:58.959 --> 16:01.659
but I can't do it
on my pancakes, okay?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.398
How did you guys meet?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.334
How did we meet?

16:09.336 --> 16:10.401
Uh, San Francisco.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.104
We volunteered at this
aids prevention organization.

16:13.106 --> 16:17.642
And we both got arrested
protesting this
Christian coalition event.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.212
Which is how I knew
it was true love.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.381
Awesome.

16:23.383 --> 16:27.618
How about you?
What's your deal?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.587
Who are you?

16:29.589 --> 16:30.588
Uh...

16:30.590 --> 16:32.590
I'm a physics student.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.459
Really?
Yeah.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.259
Physics.
Science.

16:35.261 --> 16:40.465
Yeah. I wanna be an astronaut,
but that's probably a long shot.

16:40.467 --> 16:45.103
Oh, god. I'd be terrified
to go into space.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.738
It's just, to me,

16:46.740 --> 16:50.208
earth is just this,
like, tiny speck
in the universe.

16:50.210 --> 16:55.246
And humans have only
been around for just
a speck of that timeline.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.414
So it's just...

16:56.416 --> 17:02.620
There has to be more to life
than just this, don't you think?

17:05.089 --> 17:07.224
Totally.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.628
Totally.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.266
So Tyler
was really cute, huh?

17:16.101 --> 17:17.734
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.038
It is interesting, isn't it?

17:20.040 --> 17:20.771
Very interesting.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.040
You know why?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.810
Because I love you so much.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.080
And I really feel like
we're at a place
in our relationship

17:29.082 --> 17:32.083
where there's more
than enough love to go around.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.585
And I know that
I'm not afraid of that

17:34.587 --> 17:36.421
and I don't think
that you are either.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.290
Mm-mm. Maybe I am afraid.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.525
Well, you shouldn't
be afraid

17:40.527 --> 17:44.195
because I'm here
to protect you.
Why?

17:51.537 --> 17:53.271
Carrot thief.

17:53.405 --> 17:59.110
Here's our very uncool
soccer mom Van.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.445
Whoo!

18:00.447 --> 18:03.815
Who are these guys?

18:03.817 --> 18:06.350
<i> July 23rd, 2002.</i>

18:06.352 --> 18:07.452
Road trip.
Road trip.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.855
<i> I'm driving across America</i>
<i> with Bennett and Tyler</i>

18:10.857 --> 18:15.426
<i> for an exciting new project</i>
<i> I'm working on.</i>

18:15.428 --> 18:16.427
I guess both beds are taken.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.163
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep.

18:19.165 --> 18:23.334
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

18:25.371 --> 18:29.207
This is the most fun
I've ever had in my whole life.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.442
Really?
No.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.778
<i> We are making a documentary</i>

18:33.780 --> 18:35.313
<i> about queer youth in America,</i>

18:35.315 --> 18:39.383
<i> because discrimination</i>
<i> against lgbt youth</i>

18:39.385 --> 18:40.885
<i> must be eliminated.</i>

18:40.887 --> 18:45.490
<i> I just wish people could see</i>
<i> that these kids have faces,</i>

18:45.492 --> 18:49.293
<i> names, and voices</i>
<i> that need to be heard.</i>

18:49.295 --> 18:54.398
Growing up in the church
and realizing that you're gay

18:54.400 --> 18:55.833
is very difficult.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.837
You know, your family
has never talked about it.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.872
I mean, I'm 13

19:00.874 --> 19:02.540
and it's the first time
I've heard the word.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.711
And when I heard the word
and knew what it was,

19:06.713 --> 19:10.281
then it was like,
"hey, I know that.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.818
I understand that.
That's me."

19:13.820 --> 19:15.419
My mom, she's trying.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.821
She's like really in the closet
about it.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.589
She won't mention it to anybody
or anything like that.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.625
Like, she tries to still act
like I'm straight

19:20.627 --> 19:23.928
and expects me to act like
I'm straight along with her

19:23.930 --> 19:24.862
when I'm not like that.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.465
And this was
probably more overwhelming

19:27.467 --> 19:31.235
when I tried
to kill myself, uh...

19:31.237 --> 19:35.439
But I felt so invisible

19:35.441 --> 19:38.476
to everyone around me
who was straight.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.879
There are times when I realize

19:41.881 --> 19:48.619
that I'm just as much a creation
of god as everyone else.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.491
Olympia, Washington.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.892
This is kind of somber.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.829
But even though I grew up here,

19:58.831 --> 20:04.435
because both my parents
don't live anymore,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.871
it feels like this place
is a part of a past

20:06.873 --> 20:08.940
that doesn't exist anymore.

20:08.942 --> 20:12.310
And I wasn't gay here.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.311
I mean, you couldn't be.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.780
There was this kid that everyone
just thought was gay

20:15.782 --> 20:21.786
and he had to leave school
'cause he got picked on so much.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.630
What's it like here?

20:32.632 --> 20:33.898
Liberty is falwell territory.

20:33.900 --> 20:39.370
So as you can imagine,
it's not very gay-friendly.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.575
So why do you stay?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.943
Uh...

20:48.780 --> 20:49.680
Well, I...

20:49.682 --> 20:50.881
I don't know. I, um...

20:50.883 --> 20:53.484
I didn't come out
to friends and family

20:53.486 --> 20:54.719
until last year.

20:54.721 --> 20:59.590
And I have another year
before I graduate.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.492
I'm a Christian.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.560
So...

21:02.562 --> 21:04.829
Which a lot of people
think is impossible,

21:04.831 --> 21:06.897
but I think that's
just as ridiculous

21:06.899 --> 21:10.368
as the anti-gay right, so...

21:12.739 --> 21:14.605
Just a second.

21:15.974 --> 21:16.674
Hey, sof.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.510
Do you want us
to call them for you?

21:20.280 --> 21:23.381
We're just gonna...
We're gonna wait with you
until he comes, okay?

21:23.383 --> 21:28.819
Her mother just passed.
Do you mind not filming us?

21:28.821 --> 21:29.553
So awful.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.423
Here, let's pray.
Let's pray for her, okay?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.624
All right, turn it off.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.692
We just wanna ask, father,

21:34.694 --> 21:36.060
that you would
just give her the strength

21:36.062 --> 21:39.730
to get through this
incredibly difficult time

21:39.732 --> 21:42.600
and we pray that you
would just fill us all

21:42.602 --> 21:44.935
with the compassion to know
what she must be going through

21:44.937 --> 21:48.606
because it would be impossible
for us to fully comprehend.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.008
Just show her yourself, father,
during this time

21:51.010 --> 21:54.545
and look to you right now,
father...

22:14.666 --> 22:15.933
Hey.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.102
Babe.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.571
We gotta go.
We gotta be there at 9:30.
You ready?

22:20.573 --> 22:23.774
Yeah.
All right.
See you in the car.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.448
<i> I didn't come out</i>
<i> to friends and family</i>

22:30.450 --> 22:32.383
<i> until last year.</i>

22:32.385 --> 22:33.951
<i> I'm a Christian.</i>

22:33.953 --> 22:35.052
<i> So...</i>

22:35.054 --> 22:37.421
<i> Which a lot of people</i>
<i> think is impossible,</i>

22:37.423 --> 22:39.657
<i> but I think that's</i>
<i> just as ridiculous</i>

22:39.659 --> 22:43.594
<i> as the anti-gay right, so...</i>

22:43.795 --> 22:50.034
<i> When I was young, I didn't know</i>
<i> that there were people like me.</i>

22:50.036 --> 22:54.038
<i> I felt lost, alone,</i>
<i> and confused.</i>

22:54.040 --> 22:58.576
<i> I never even told my mother,</i>
<i> my best friend, that I was gay</i>

22:58.578 --> 23:01.112
<i> because I was afraid</i>
<i> she wouldn't accept me.</i>

23:01.114 --> 23:03.547
<i> That's why</i>
<i> we're on this journey:</i>

23:03.549 --> 23:07.752
<i> To let gay kids know</i>
<i> that they are not alone.</i>

23:07.754 --> 23:11.489
<i> And you know what?</i>
<i> I learned a lot as well.</i>

23:11.491 --> 23:14.024
<i> Because we met</i>
<i> so many amazing people</i>

23:14.026 --> 23:15.860
<i> who've heard their parents</i>
<i> or pastors</i>

23:15.862 --> 23:18.863
<i> tell them they're wrong</i>
<i> and yet they've come</i>

23:18.865 --> 23:21.599
<i> to the realization</i>
<i> that they're beautiful,</i>

23:21.601 --> 23:26.036
<i> blessed, and that god</i>
<i> loves them just as they are.</i>

23:26.038 --> 23:30.541
<i> I mean, people who believe</i>
<i> that homosexuality is wrong</i>

23:30.543 --> 23:36.680
<i> are gonna change their minds</i>
<i> thanks to this next generation.</i>

24:39.611 --> 24:43.914
The sky is fucking beautiful.

24:46.219 --> 24:49.253
What is this, babe?

24:49.255 --> 24:50.754
Hmm?

24:51.857 --> 24:52.690
Oh, it's stupid.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.059
Just somebody gave it to me
on the street.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.696
"Where will we go
when we die?"

24:58.698 --> 25:01.165
Baby.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.767
You guys,
where will we go
when we die?

25:03.769 --> 25:07.705
In 2012, the world
is supposed to end.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.673
Is that a real thing?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.141
I hope not.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.843
Everyone knows this.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.013
It's what they drew
on the Mayan calendar.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.516
You know,
the Mayan calendar thing.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.919
That's what they drew.
It was the moon and the sun.

26:14.639 --> 26:17.875
What? I'm curious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.211
We wanna know. Please.
We wanna know. Please.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.281
I don't think
they wanna know.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.900
Mike.

26:45.236 --> 26:47.738
You guys go on.
I'll meet you at home.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.707
You okay?

26:49.709 --> 26:50.941
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.210
Where are you going?

26:53.212 --> 26:55.679
Michael?

26:55.814 --> 27:00.751
What's that about?
I have absolutely
no earthly idea.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.828
Baby.

27:45.163 --> 27:50.067
I was worried about you today.
What's going on?

27:54.874 --> 27:56.940
It's stupid.

27:56.942 --> 28:00.711
Baby, nothing's stupid.
Tell me what.

28:03.348 --> 28:09.053
Do you think when we die,

28:09.055 --> 28:14.124
we just disappear
like we never existed?

28:17.762 --> 28:20.297
No, I don't think that.

28:20.765 --> 28:24.468
Because I know that
we'll always be together.

28:26.838 --> 28:28.305
Baby.

28:35.346 --> 28:36.380
Baby.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.050
Baby, you're okay.
I'm here.

28:57.068 --> 29:00.838
Let's pray for her.
Let's pray.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.852
Bennett!

29:15.920 --> 29:16.987
Bennett!

29:19.925 --> 29:20.991
I'm really lightheaded.

29:20.993 --> 29:26.930
It's okay. It's okay.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

29:40.545 --> 29:41.278
Okay.

29:41.280 --> 29:46.884
Your heartrate
seems to have returned
back to normal.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.018
Can you check again?

29:48.020 --> 29:50.888
Just because your father had hcm
does not mean that you have it.

29:50.890 --> 29:56.360
We followed
our chest pain protocol
and there's nothing abnormal.

29:56.362 --> 30:00.130
You had a panic attack. Okay?

30:02.167 --> 30:03.967
Where's Bennett?

30:03.969 --> 30:04.902
He's in the lobby.

30:04.904 --> 30:09.006
As soon as you're checked out,
you can see him.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.541
All right?

30:10.543 --> 30:12.109
Thank you.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.115
<i> I was 13 years old,</i>

30:18.117 --> 30:20.250
<i> walking along the beach</i>
<i> with my father,</i>

30:20.252 --> 30:22.252
<i> when he suddenly collapsed</i>
<i> and died</i>

30:22.254 --> 30:25.589
<i> from an unexpected</i>
<i> heart condition.</i>

30:28.459 --> 30:30.327
<i> If I've inherited his disease,</i>

30:30.329 --> 30:33.597
<i> the same thing</i>
<i> could happen to me.</i>

30:34.499 --> 30:36.500
What's wrong, baby?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.169
It's happening again.
I can feel it.

30:39.171 --> 30:43.106
The tests confirmed that--
they don't know.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.042
They don't care.

30:45.878 --> 30:49.546
<i> Now I'm having</i>
<i> heart palpitations</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

30:49.548 --> 30:52.883
<i> And contrary to what</i>
<i> the doctors keep saying,</i>

30:52.885 --> 30:56.954
<i> I just know</i>
<i> they aren't panic attacks.</i>

30:57.155 --> 30:58.989
<i> After months of fighting</i>
<i> with my insurance,</i>

30:58.991 --> 31:01.291
<i> I was finally allowed</i>
<i> to see a specialist</i>

31:01.293 --> 31:03.527
<i> who could definitively test</i>
<i> whether or not</i>

31:03.529 --> 31:07.064
<i> I inherited</i>
<i> my father's condition.</i>

31:07.332 --> 31:10.167
<i> Now I have to wait</i>
<i> for the results.</i>

31:10.169 --> 31:13.904
Michael,
just calm down.
Calm down!

31:13.906 --> 31:15.038
Do you know
what this disease means?

31:15.040 --> 31:19.076
It means
i could die any minute,
just drop dead!

31:19.078 --> 31:21.044
You calm down!

33:59.504 --> 34:01.204
Dr. Williams?

34:01.206 --> 34:02.572
Hi.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.830
Thank you, god.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.835
Thank you, god.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.074
<i> The test confirmed</i>

34:37.076 --> 34:40.310
<i> that I did not inherit</i>
<i> my father's heart condition.</i>

34:40.312 --> 34:44.447
<i> Although it's</i>
<i> a massive sigh of relief,</i>

34:44.449 --> 34:46.516
<i> I keep thinking to myself...</i>

34:46.518 --> 34:50.520
<i> If I was really</i>
<i> just having panic attacks,</i>

34:50.522 --> 34:52.856
<i> then what's wrong with me?</i>

34:52.858 --> 34:55.659
<i> What am I afraid of?</i>

35:00.164 --> 35:03.100
<i> All I know is that when</i>
<i> faced with your own death,</i>

35:03.102 --> 35:05.702
<i> it reminds you</i>
<i> of what's important in life.</i>

35:05.704 --> 35:10.607
<i> And for me,</i>
<i> that's helping other people.</i>

35:11.609 --> 35:12.309
Okay.

35:12.311 --> 35:16.146
<i> So I've decided</i>
<i> to start my own magazine.</i>

35:16.148 --> 35:19.249
<i> I'm calling it</i> yga.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.217
Young gay Americans.

35:20.219 --> 35:24.254
<i> It's gonna be the biggest</i>
<i> and most sophisticated magazine</i>

35:24.256 --> 35:28.892
<i> aimed at improving the lives</i>
<i> of lgbt youth.</i>

36:15.640 --> 36:17.440
Hmm.

36:44.902 --> 36:45.969
What is this?

36:45.971 --> 36:48.738
What is this?

36:48.740 --> 36:52.275
Oh, my god! Hi!

36:52.277 --> 36:53.877
You didn't.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.545
I know you
wanted one, baby.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.380
Oh, my god!

37:04.288 --> 37:05.755
Ooh.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.558
What are we gonna call you?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.527
What are we gonna call you?

37:11.997 --> 37:14.898
Olly. Olly, heel.

37:15.266 --> 37:18.368
I've been thinking
about the next issue of <i> yga.</i>

37:18.370 --> 37:21.838
I think we need to address
this whole christianity thing.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.806
What do you mean?

37:22.808 --> 37:25.942
Well, people think that gays
and christians are enemies.

37:25.944 --> 37:31.748
We've met so many people
who've managed to balance
their faith and their sexuality.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.651
But we've also met
so many people whose parents

37:34.653 --> 37:37.254
and churches tell them
they're gonna burn in hell.

37:37.256 --> 37:40.290
Yeah, which is why
we should address it
in the magazine.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.893
I mean, the whole "you're gay,
you're going to hell" myth

37:43.895 --> 37:48.932
was started by mistranslations
and misinterpretations
of the Bible.

37:48.934 --> 37:53.403
I mean, god doesn't care
what your sexual orientation is.

37:53.405 --> 37:58.275
And the one thing
that the gay movement
doesn't understand

37:58.277 --> 37:59.442
that I think christianity does

37:59.444 --> 38:06.383
is that not everyone
wants to be a part
of the subculture.

38:06.517 --> 38:10.053
I'm sorry,
what did you do
with my boyfriend?

38:10.055 --> 38:11.488
Shut up.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.357
I'm not gonna write like...

38:15.726 --> 38:19.763
Gospel according to Michael
or something.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.535
<i> It might seem strange</i>
<i> for a gay youth magazine</i>

38:25.537 --> 38:29.339
<i> to dedicate an entire issue</i>
<i> to religion,</i>

38:29.341 --> 38:32.776
<i> but it's too important</i>
<i> to ignore.</i>

38:33.377 --> 38:37.414
<i> When my parents died,</i>
<i> I blamed god.</i>

38:37.416 --> 38:38.381
<i> When I came out,</i>

38:38.383 --> 38:42.319
<i> I distanced myself even further</i>
<i> from religion.</i>

38:42.321 --> 38:47.457
<i> You see, I thought I was</i>
<i> too smart to believe in god,</i>

38:47.459 --> 38:50.660
<i> that he was only</i>
<i> for the needy.</i>

38:50.995 --> 38:52.662
<i> But after</i>
<i> a recent health scare,</i>

38:52.664 --> 38:57.867
<i> I felt this nudging</i>
<i> in the back of my mind:</i>

38:57.869 --> 39:00.904
<i> The presence of god.</i>

39:00.906 --> 39:02.872
<i> And you know what?</i>

39:02.874 --> 39:06.343
<i> I was no longer afraid.</i>

39:07.011 --> 39:07.744
Aah!

39:07.746 --> 39:10.547
<i> Some religious figures</i>
<i> spout hateful rhetoric</i>

39:10.549 --> 39:14.451
<i> and try to force</i>
<i> a monopoly on the truth.</i>

39:14.453 --> 39:17.921
<i> But the only truth is love.</i>

39:17.923 --> 39:22.425
<i> The only sin is denying love.</i>

39:22.427 --> 39:24.728
<i> Stop hating.</i>

39:24.730 --> 39:28.064
<i> Start loving.</i>

39:37.408 --> 39:39.142
You gonna join us?

39:39.144 --> 39:41.778
Uh, yeah, just one second.

39:47.551 --> 39:48.385
What?

39:48.387 --> 39:51.688
Uh, you're really combing
through that thing,
aren't you?

39:51.690 --> 39:56.893
Look, my whole life,
i thought the Bible
was full of hate...

39:56.895 --> 39:58.128
And it's not.

39:58.130 --> 39:59.863
There's a lot of love in here.

39:59.865 --> 40:04.667
So your interest in the Bible
is more than just research?

40:04.669 --> 40:09.406
Well, there's a lot
of Christian roots
in my family,

40:09.408 --> 40:12.041
my mom, my aunt and...

40:12.043 --> 40:12.776
Just curious.

40:12.778 --> 40:16.413
Your aunts disowned you
when you came out.

40:16.415 --> 40:18.047
That's not family.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.949
I'm all for curiosity but--

40:19.951 --> 40:24.120
i-i just feel like
something saved me,

40:24.122 --> 40:27.123
shook me and woke me up.

40:27.792 --> 40:31.494
And that someone is god?

40:32.029 --> 40:38.601
Mike, he didn't save you
because you were never dying.

40:40.871 --> 40:43.173
Okay.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.510
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

40:47.512 --> 40:51.815
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

40:53.684 --> 40:56.786
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

40:56.788 --> 41:02.659
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

41:02.793 --> 41:04.894
"Whoever finds their life
will lose it,

41:04.896 --> 41:09.532
and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it."

41:15.039 --> 41:19.108
Don't see many people
flaunting that out in the open.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.143
Oh.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.479
I've seen you
reading out here before

41:22.481 --> 41:26.082
and I thought maybe you'd
wanna come to my church.

41:26.084 --> 41:30.620
Any Sunday,
just to check it out.

41:30.622 --> 41:34.224
See what the mormon religion
has to offer.

41:34.558 --> 41:40.697
The gospel teaches us
that we are the spirit children

41:40.699 --> 41:42.065
of heavenly parents.

41:42.067 --> 41:48.905
Now, many people ask,
are we like other christians?

41:48.907 --> 41:51.007
Why of course we are.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.076
We believe in Jesus Christ

41:53.078 --> 41:56.513
and we believe
in life after death.

41:56.515 --> 42:01.017
And everyone is welcome
at the lds church.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.888
Christ's atonement
allows mankind to be saved
from their sins...

42:04.890 --> 42:09.692
And to return to live with god
and their loved ones in heaven.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.862
Did you grow up
with any kind of faith?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.063
Not really.

42:14.065 --> 42:14.964
My mother was Christian,

42:14.966 --> 42:18.768
but she didn't really take
me or my sister to church,

42:18.770 --> 42:22.138
and my father
was a Berkeley hippie,

42:22.140 --> 42:25.575
kind of agnostic
or even atheist.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.010
They were very good people

42:27.012 --> 42:31.681
and I know
I'll see them again in heaven.

42:31.683 --> 42:34.551
My mom passed away as well.

42:34.553 --> 42:36.319
So I know how hard that is.

42:36.321 --> 42:41.291
I was so afraid and angry,
you know?

42:41.293 --> 42:42.859
Yeah, me, too.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.894
It's really hard
to deal with death

42:44.896 --> 42:48.031
when you don't know
where you're going.

42:48.666 --> 42:51.301
But once you do,
then you have peace

42:51.303 --> 42:54.938
and you realize
that god's not to blame.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.840
Right.
Yeah.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.176
Catherine.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.880
It was nice to meet you.

43:03.882 --> 43:05.248
You, too.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.120
She's single, fyi.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.889
Fyi?

43:12.891 --> 43:14.657
What, you think
she likes me?

43:14.659 --> 43:16.859
Yeah. Yeah,
it seemed like it.

43:16.861 --> 43:22.332
But I mean, don't worry.
There's plenty of single ladies
looking for a husband.

43:22.334 --> 43:26.235
I wasn't even thinking
about that kind of thing.

43:26.237 --> 43:30.039
Oh, well, maybe it's something
you should start thinking about.

43:30.041 --> 43:33.977
I can get you in touch with her
if you want.

43:34.845 --> 43:36.112
Oh, um...

43:36.114 --> 43:38.681
If you're interested.

43:40.618 --> 43:41.751
Sure. I don't know.

43:41.753 --> 43:44.387
Yeah?
Okay. Whatever.
Yeah, okay.

43:44.389 --> 43:45.755
All right.
Okay, thanks.

43:45.757 --> 43:49.025
Embarrassing me
a little bit.

44:13.751 --> 44:15.018
<i> Welcome back to new beginnings</i>

44:15.020 --> 44:18.221
<i> and thank you for listening</i>
<i> to our continued conversation</i>

44:18.223 --> 44:19.856
<i> about the truth path to heaven.</i>

44:19.858 --> 44:23.893
<i> Doctor, how would you respond</i>
<i> to other christians</i>

44:23.895 --> 44:25.128
<i> who disagree with your angle?</i>

44:25.130 --> 44:28.765
<i> Look, all I'm trying</i>
<i> to do is help people.</i>

44:28.767 --> 44:32.669
<i> It just pains me so much when</i>
<i> I hear so-called christians</i>

44:32.671 --> 44:36.205
<i> side with the left on issues</i>
<i> such as homosexuality.</i>

44:36.207 --> 44:39.308
<i> Now, I'm not condoning hate.</i>

44:39.310 --> 44:41.678
<i> In fact, this is about love.</i>

44:41.680 --> 44:44.147
<i> Choosing a gay identity</i>
<i> will condemn you</i>

44:44.149 --> 44:45.982
<i> to an eternity of suffering.</i>

44:45.984 --> 44:48.351
<i> And I wanna save people</i>
<i> from that.</i>

44:48.353 --> 44:51.120
<i> Whether it's abortion</i>
<i> or adultery</i>

44:51.122 --> 44:55.124
<i> or accepting religions</i>
<i> other than christianity,</i>

44:55.126 --> 44:56.793
<i> you must obey god's law</i>

44:56.795 --> 45:00.997
<i> or you will not be allowed</i>
<i> into his kingdom.</i>

45:39.470 --> 45:42.071
I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying
that it's wrong.

45:42.073 --> 45:45.241
I'm just saying
that over the course
of thousands of years,

45:45.243 --> 45:48.845
people with an agenda
have made christianity
what it is today.

45:48.847 --> 45:55.351
Yeah, but the original message
is still the same,
it's about love.

45:57.020 --> 46:00.790
You know, I would've never
pegged you as a Buddhist.

46:00.792 --> 46:01.224
Why?

46:01.226 --> 46:04.260
What, 'cause I don't look
a certain way?

46:04.262 --> 46:05.428
No, I...

46:05.430 --> 46:07.930
I don't know why
i just said that.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.899
I'm just kidding you.

46:09.901 --> 46:10.433
Meditation.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.835
People get weird in their head
about meditation.

46:12.837 --> 46:14.237
They think it's weird
or hippie.

46:14.239 --> 46:18.207
I think it's about
developing mindfulness.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.109
You know, it's about
living moment to moment.

46:20.111 --> 46:24.280
And in a deeper level,
it's about knowing yourself.

46:24.282 --> 46:28.017
That's why I started
volunteering at
the Buddhist center.

46:28.019 --> 46:30.353
They have classes on Friday.
You should come.

46:30.355 --> 46:35.358
Oh, I have to go out of town
for this speaking thing.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.293
What kind of speaking thing?

46:37.295 --> 46:40.329
It's about gay youth
in America.

46:40.331 --> 46:43.199
No way. That's awesome.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.575
Welcome to our very first panel

47:25.577 --> 47:28.144
on being young and gay
in America.

47:28.146 --> 47:30.146
Joining us is Judy Shepard,

47:30.148 --> 47:33.149
president of
the Matthew Shepard foundation,

47:33.151 --> 47:35.184
dedicated to
working towards causes

47:35.186 --> 47:38.855
championed by her son Matthew
during his life.

47:38.857 --> 47:40.256
Thank you for joining us.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.531
Michael glatze,
former editor of <i> XY</i> magazine,

47:48.533 --> 47:53.202
recipient of equality forum's
national role model award

47:53.204 --> 47:56.105
as well as lambda's
literary award

47:56.107 --> 47:57.473
for <i> XY's</i> survival guide,

47:57.475 --> 48:01.577
participant in the
award-winning documentary

48:01.579 --> 48:02.445
<i> Jim in bold,</i>

48:02.447 --> 48:04.347
and co-founder
of <i> young gay Americans,</i>

48:04.349 --> 48:07.016
which is now
a full-fledged magazine.

48:12.623 --> 48:15.992
What does being gay
mean to you?

48:16.193 --> 48:21.564
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

48:21.566 --> 48:25.167
<i> And it's more important now</i>
<i> than ever</i>

48:25.169 --> 48:28.404
<i> to make allies</i>
<i> and make alliances</i>

48:28.406 --> 48:33.009
<i> both inside</i>
<i> and outside the gay community.</i>

48:36.346 --> 48:42.151
<i> Gay doesn't mean the same thing</i>
<i> that it meant 20 years ago.</i>

48:42.153 --> 48:44.053
<i> It's not about--</i>

49:18.288 --> 49:19.722
hey.

49:22.192 --> 49:23.559
No.

49:25.429 --> 49:27.730
I have to walk the dog.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.137
Hey.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.776
What are you doing?

50:13.778 --> 50:18.014
I need some space.

50:18.782 --> 50:20.316
Mike--
look, I just...

50:20.318 --> 50:22.018
I need some time
to figure this out,

50:22.020 --> 50:24.620
to see where this
is taking me.

50:25.722 --> 50:28.557
Why can't you come to me
for help?

50:28.559 --> 50:30.726
We have to talk about this
before--

50:30.728 --> 50:32.294
look, I just...

50:32.296 --> 50:35.531
I need to get away
from this life.

50:35.766 --> 50:38.367
Our life?
Yes.

50:38.502 --> 50:42.772
And what exactly is it
about our life that you need
to get away from, being gay?

50:42.774 --> 50:44.407
I don't know.

50:44.409 --> 50:45.508
I don't know!

50:45.510 --> 50:50.346
Okay, uh, are you
attracted to women?

50:50.348 --> 50:52.081
Because if that's the case,
then fine, go explore.

50:52.083 --> 50:56.318
I just wanna be with my parents
in heaven. Is that so hard
to understand?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.187
Can you even hear yourself
right now?

50:58.189 --> 51:00.823
What happened
to the misinterpretation
of the Bible?

51:00.825 --> 51:02.058
It's a fucking book, Mike!

51:02.060 --> 51:04.760
I read the Bible the same way
i read anything else,

51:04.762 --> 51:06.228
with an open mind
and an open heart.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.263
Oh, is that what
you call this?

51:07.265 --> 51:11.067
'Cause the way you're talking
doesn't exactly sound
very fucking open-minded.

51:11.069 --> 51:17.406
This relationship
has just developed
into something unhealthy.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.176
What does that even mean?

51:21.211 --> 51:22.378
Tyler?

51:22.380 --> 51:25.614
You were just as
interested in that as I was.

51:25.616 --> 51:26.315
No.

51:26.317 --> 51:27.483
I just wanted you
to be happy

51:27.485 --> 51:29.418
because I was afraid
you were gonna leave.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.187
I was never
gonna leave, Mike.

51:31.189 --> 51:31.821
I've stood by you.

51:31.823 --> 51:34.290
I've held your hand while you
were so terrified of dying

51:34.292 --> 51:37.860
that you created illnesses
that didn't even exist.

51:37.862 --> 51:42.264
The truth is that
i was living a lie.

51:42.767 --> 51:47.603
The truth is that god loves us--
shut the fuck up!

51:51.541 --> 51:52.875
Okay.

51:52.877 --> 51:54.443
Wait.

52:02.687 --> 52:05.387
Please don't go.

52:10.260 --> 52:13.429
Where are you going?

52:19.703 --> 52:24.673
The thing
that will really kill you...

52:24.675 --> 52:29.445
Is repressing
who you truly are.

52:29.579 --> 52:33.315
That's what you
should really be afraid of.

53:41.885 --> 53:46.288
So he just left this here
out in the open?

54:32.936 --> 54:37.373
<i> I have come to a decision</i>
<i> that will be shocking</i>

54:37.375 --> 54:40.542
<i> to anyone I used to relate to.</i>

54:41.479 --> 54:46.415
<i> The presence of god</i>
<i> has grown strong in my life.</i>

54:46.417 --> 54:49.518
<i> He told me</i>
<i> that my panic attacks</i>

54:49.520 --> 54:54.690
<i> were caused by my shallow,</i>
<i> sinful lifestyle.</i>

54:55.459 --> 55:00.596
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that identifying as gay</i>

55:00.598 --> 55:05.067
<i> prevents you from finding</i>
<i> your true self within.</i>

55:05.069 --> 55:07.336
<i> And we must be our true selves</i>

55:07.338 --> 55:11.340
<i> in order to join god</i>
<i> in his kingdom.</i>

55:11.808 --> 55:15.411
<i> Therefore, I,</i>
<i> Michael glatze,</i>

55:15.413 --> 55:19.081
<i> no longer identify</i>
<i> as gay.</i>

57:32.682 --> 57:34.783
Why did you do it?

57:38.054 --> 57:40.222
"Gay activist goes straight"?

57:40.224 --> 57:43.892
You gave the anti-gay right
the story of their dreams.

57:43.894 --> 57:45.828
I don't know why.

57:45.830 --> 57:47.930
I don't know.

57:47.932 --> 57:49.731
Who pushed you?

57:49.733 --> 57:50.699
No one.

57:50.701 --> 57:53.569
I just wanted
to tell my story.

57:53.571 --> 57:55.571
Look, I think
this all happened

57:55.573 --> 57:57.840
because god needed
to teach me a lesson.

57:57.842 --> 58:02.478
That's why I'm here,
to make it better.

58:07.518 --> 58:10.486
Meditation is a way
of slowing down

58:10.488 --> 58:13.689
and developing kindness
towards yourself.

58:13.691 --> 58:19.962
Through mindfulness practice,
we develop strength of mind.

58:19.964 --> 58:21.997
We become more present

58:21.999 --> 58:26.068
and we learn
to appreciate our world.

58:30.673 --> 58:34.243
<i> God works in mysterious ways.</i>

58:34.245 --> 58:35.844
<i> He has sent me to a place</i>

58:35.846 --> 58:38.680
<i> where I can get away</i>
<i> from the physical world</i>

58:38.682 --> 58:41.917
<i> so that I can focus</i>
<i> on my true self--</i>

58:41.919 --> 58:44.920
<i> a happier, healthier man,</i>

58:44.922 --> 58:48.290
<i> free of unnatural desires.</i>

58:54.998 --> 59:00.235
<i> At first, I didn't understand</i>
<i> why god would send a Christian</i>

59:00.237 --> 59:02.638
<i> to a Buddhist retreat.</i>

59:02.640 --> 59:06.708
<i> But I have faith</i>
<i> in his plan for me.</i>

59:13.217 --> 59:15.250
<i> Desire is powerful.</i>

59:15.252 --> 59:18.253
<i> And god is testing me.</i>

59:18.255 --> 59:23.725
<i> But I refuse to give in</i>
<i> to temptation.</i>

59:28.197 --> 59:29.831
<i> I've come to the realization</i>

59:29.833 --> 59:32.868
<i> that god wants me</i>
<i> to use meditation</i>

59:32.870 --> 59:37.906
<i> to rid myself</i>
<i> of abnormal desires.</i>

59:38.074 --> 59:41.944
God gave Buddha the light
to be Buddha.

59:41.946 --> 59:42.344
He did.

59:42.346 --> 59:44.646
Michael,
what are you talking about?

59:44.648 --> 59:49.718
I just want us
to be on the right path
for our future,

59:49.720 --> 59:52.321
for our health,
for the afterlife.

59:52.323 --> 59:56.992
I am on the right path, okay?
My path.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.204
Michael, i--
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.742
I'm sorry, Nico.

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:33.061
It's the same kind of strength

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:35.998
that you need
to-to clear your mind.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.801
You know, we just, we need
to find that strength

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:44.773
to fight what we both know
in our hearts is wrong.

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.241
We just have to fight it.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.876
Stop, Michael. Stop.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:50.245
No, I mean...

01:00:58.688 --> 01:00:59.855
Michael, you're confused.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:04.893
You're very confused
and it's at my expense.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.855
<i> People have been asking</i>
<i> how I am.</i>

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.724
<i> Some out of support.</i>

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:38.126
<i> Others who think</i>
<i> I've reconsidered.</i>

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:43.298
<i> I've come to the realization</i>
<i> that Bennett represents soul,</i>

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:48.870
<i> Tyler represents body,</i>
<i> Nico represents mind.</i>

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:52.107
<i> Father, son, holy ghost.</i>

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:55.310
<i> I guess god need me</i>
<i> to complete the Trinity</i>

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:57.746
<i> in order to move on.</i>

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.748
<i> So I'm ready to set</i>
<i> the record straight.</i>

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:04.886
<i> I was a heterosexual person</i>
<i> with a homosexual problem,</i>

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.456
<i> and I took care</i>
<i> of that problem.</i>

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:11.059
<i> I have not reconsidered.</i>

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.830
A good number of people
have come forward

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:15.964
and expressed
their concern

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.933
about your being involved
with this organization.

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:21.970
This center is supposed
to accept everyone.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.405
Yes, and we do.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.841
We welcome people
of all beliefs,

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:28.744
but we don't tolerate hate.

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:30.779
I don't hate anybody.

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:35.817
Michael, you've written
what some would call
very hateful things.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:39.955
Those are my beliefs.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.390
Are you okay?

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:44.259
Yeah.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:47.195
Are you okay?

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:49.431
I don't know...

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:54.102
I don't understand
what has changed, but I, uh...

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.238
Here we practice compassion.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.009
And I'm just, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work out.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:06.848
So, because I'm Christian
and I express my opinions...

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.184
I have to leave.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:13.421
That's so messed up.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.459
That's really everything?

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:54.429
Your whole life
is in that one bag?

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:57.265
Yeah.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.603
Do you think
you'll stay here?

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:08.143
I mean, San Francisco
can't be the best place
for an...

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.244
Ex-gay.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:15.183
I'm not an ex-gay.
I'm just me.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:18.286
Honestly, I thought
you'd be happy.

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:20.889
I mean, you never
really approved.

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.390
That's not true.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:26.027
Then why haven't we been close?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.395
I mean, you're my sister.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:31.600
We're supposed to be there
for each other.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:35.337
We can be close now.

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:37.372
I'm glad you're here.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:44.379
And I want you to be happy--
loving whomever.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.481
Yeah?

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:47.983
Yeah.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.323
I'm sorry.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.691
No, I can't.
What?

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.426
No, I'm sorry. Uh...

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.462
What happened?
I can't. Um...

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:45.133
It's not you, it's...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:36.084
Olly, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.458
<i> Hello?</i>

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.168
Michael?

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.670
<i> Bennett.</i>

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.309
Where are you?

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.845
<i> Are you okay?</i>

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:07.715
<i> Michael?</i>

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:09.184
I have to go.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:12.687
<i> Wait, why did you call me,</i>
<i> Michael?</i>

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:26.868
To my friends who are trapped
in homosexuality:

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:29.504
I wanna thank you
for your kind comments

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:32.807
and keen observations
regarding my story

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:37.779
and my revelation that
i am no longer homosexual

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.546
and am now heterosexual.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:44.252
The gay identity has been
packaged and fed to you,

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:48.622
and if you identify as gay
then you have eaten it,

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.126
preventing you
from further growth

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.828
and understanding
of your true self.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:58.332
<i> But it's not too late</i>
<i> to save yourself.</i>

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:00.535
<i> If you follow my lead.</i>

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:05.473
<i> I am confident.</i>
<i> I am blessed.</i>

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.808
<i> I am strong.</i>

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:12.180
<i> I am ready to give up</i>
<i> my life for Christ</i>

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:16.618
<i> in order to find</i>
<i> my true self.</i>

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.921
You sure you
don't want a coffee?

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:30.625
I don't drink coffee anymore.

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.864
You're well?

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.700
Yeah. Why?

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:41.603
Just asking.

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:47.842
I'm great.
I've never been better.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:53.548
Well, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:57.852
So does Bennett.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:10:58.987
Hmm.

01:10:58.989 --> 01:11:02.857
I wish I could understand
what you're going through.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:07.595
I just don't want to be
perceived as gay

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.531
for the rest of my experiences.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.801
It's that simple.

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:19.274
Are you still
with Bennett?

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:20.008
No.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:26.848
I'm, uh, going to Europe
to study space science.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:28.616
That's great.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.752
I'm going
to Bible school.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:34.022
God told me
to become a pastor.

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:46.668
I don't want to open
old wounds or anything,

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:53.941
but I also don't know when
I'll ever see you again.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:58.413
I want you to know
how much you meant to me.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:07.822
I know you don't care anymore.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:11.559
But I needed to say it.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:14.662
For closure.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.636
This whole thing...

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:25.506
It broke my heart.

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.344
Tyler...

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:32.680
I'm sorry.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:36.784
But I need to live
for myself now.

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:40.955
Okay.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.395
Okay.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.465
Take care.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:43.084
Now, sometimes somebody's
gonna ask you what you believe.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.620
They're gonna say,
"you're a Christian,

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.455
all right,
what do you believe?"

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:51.626
Maybe they're an atheist
or a agnostic or a Muslim

01:13:51.628 --> 01:13:54.896
or a Buddha, you know,
who knows what they are?

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:57.865
And you better be ready
to tell 'em.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:00.802
We believe the Bible
is the word of god,

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:07.208
the supreme, final authority
in life and in our faith.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.178
We believe in one god,

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.080
eternally existing
in three persons:

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.817
The father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:19.454
And we believe
the sole condition

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.823
for receiving
everlasting life

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:29.931
is belief and faith alone
in the lord Jesus Christ.

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:15.243
Thank you.

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:17.945
I'll have one
of those, please.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.226
Hi, I'm Michael.

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:35.129
Uh, hi, I'm Rebekah.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:39.867
Guess we like
all the same things.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.771
I love it here.

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:45.940
I mean, I never though
I'd end up in Wyoming,

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:49.677
but I feel like I've
finally found my niche.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.980
Where'd you think
you'd end up?

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:56.784
That's a good question.
I don't know.

01:15:56.786 --> 01:16:00.788
All I know is that I've
always wanted to help people,

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:04.625
because some people
struggle so much

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:08.095
when the solution
is actually very simple.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.298
It's right there
in Matthew 10:

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.635
The road may not be easy,
but if we give up our lives

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:21.208
for Christ, then we'll find
our true selves.

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:30.117
Where did you
go to college?

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:31.586
Dartmouth.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:32.620
Wow.

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:33.955
And you majored in music?

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:37.158
In creative writing
and English literature,

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.795
but I minored
in music theory
and composition.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:44.699
That must've kept you busy.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:46.367
What kind of stuff
did you write?

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:51.205
Well, my thesis
was all poetry, actually.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.808
Can I read some?

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.343
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:59.780
My poetry
is from a different life.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.348
But I, um...

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:05.386
I'm so interested in music now
because it transcends language.

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:09.323
You know, it's like people
don't have to argue about it

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.826
or judge it
or misinterpret it.

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:13.127
They can just listen.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.764
You know, I just play
and they just listen.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:17.264
You know?

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:19.667
I don't know if I do,
to be honest,

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:22.803
but the way you say it,
i want to.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.006
I'm sorry, I'm just blabbing.
What about you?

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:29.343
No, don't be sorry!
You're not blabbing. Um...

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:30.911
I majored in theater.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:31.946
Theater? Really?
Yeah.

01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:36.817
Yeah, it was really fun,
but it's not like
it's a real job.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.254
I actually stage managed
a little bit after college,

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:44.091
but I don't know,
i felt adrift.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:49.864
So I came here,
hoping to figure out my path.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:52.199
Me, too.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:44.318
I can't believe
you've never had Sushi.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.089
Who hasn't had Sushi?
It's crazy.

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:50.024
Mm.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.225
Oh, no.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:53.227
You don't like it.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.028
I'm sorry.

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.263
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:18:56.265 --> 01:18:57.832
Oh...
I'm sorry.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:01.202
No, I used to hate it
when my ex did that.

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:03.304
Always making decisions.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:05.973
We can go somewhere else.
No.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:08.142
No, no, no.
No, it's okay.

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:09.076
Are you sure?

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:13.514
Yes. Yeah.
You like it. It's fine.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:22.456
Uh, how, um, how long ago
was the ex you mentioned?

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:25.993
Oh. It was a long time ago.
It was, uh...

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:28.529
I don't know why
i brought that up.

01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:30.264
It was stupid.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.967
Well, um, was it serious?

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:36.036
Were you gonna marry her?

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:42.543
It was serious,
but, um, no, not marriage.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:46.380
What about you?

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.848
Oh, no, I've...

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:50.484
I've never been in
a serious relationship.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:55.222
My parents are very,
very conservative.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:57.458
Do you think
they'd approve of me?

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.562
The future pastor
i met at Bible school?

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:04.398
Yes, I think they'd approve.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.203
Rebekah.

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.004
Hi.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.273
Hi.

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.176
What?

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.344
I just...

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:53.380
Since when do you
wear shirts like that?

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:57.251
What? It's not inappropriate
and it's hot out.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:21:03.324
You're here to serve our lord,
not distract our men.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:07.528
I don't think
I'm distracting anyone.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.963
Is this about Michael?

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:13.367
We are not letting what we have
get in the way of our studies.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:17.204
Besides, the lord
brought us together.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:20.241
It's about his past.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.142
What about it?

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:26.113
You really don't know?

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.516
Know what?

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.472
Rebekah.

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:52.606
Oh. Hi.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:54.074
Are we still meeting?

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.645
Yeah, just let me finish this.
I'll be right there.

01:21:57.647 --> 01:22:01.415
Okay.
I'll be in the cafeteria.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.417
Okay.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:25.539
I have something
i have to tell you.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.079
You already know,
don't you?

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:38.419
Are you still
attracted to men?

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:40.587
No.

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:43.991
It's in the past.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:45.092
Okay, I...

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:46.593
God showed me the light.

01:22:46.595 --> 01:22:48.429
He showed me the truth.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:53.167
A lot of people have pasts
they're not proud of,

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:57.504
but god forgives, right?

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:01.608
My life has changed so much
since I've met you.

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:04.645
And my feelings for you
are real.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:08.415
My feelings for you
are real, too.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:15.022
But I feel like we should
just keep hanging out
and see what happens.

01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:19.526
Maybe not settle on
anything too specific.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.396
If that's okay.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.733
Okay.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.196
Hi, I'm Michael.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:36.804
Now, I wanna tell you
a little secret

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:41.809
about a great gift from god.

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.511
This gift is a human emotion

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:49.850
and considered destructive
by the enemies of god.

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.289
Fear.

01:24:55.291 --> 01:25:01.361
You can never, never,
never stop

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:04.198
fearing yourself.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:08.302
We are our own worst enemies.

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:15.642
And we must fear ourselves till
the day we meet god himself.

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:22.249
God didn't put us here to live
our lives in constant fear.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:23.150
No, of course not.

01:25:23.152 --> 01:25:27.154
And then he scolded me
for asking questions.

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.622
Well, that's not fair.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:29.490
We're here to learn

01:25:29.492 --> 01:25:30.724
and we learn in part
by asking questions.

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:34.128
No, we're here to serve god,
not to identify

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:39.399
as the exact kind of christians
they want us to be.

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:41.768
I'm sorry.

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:42.669
Don't be.

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:48.175
You know what's best
because that's god
speaking through you.

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:57.751
You wanted to see me?

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.754
Now, you've been rallying
the students against us

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:05.826
as though you're
being controlled
by the devil himself.

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:10.831
I've learned a lot
about the Bible here,

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.266
and for that I thank you.

01:26:12.268 --> 01:26:18.505
But I refuse to be controlled
by anyone other than god.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.806
I follow my own path.

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:23.544
Yeah, and you want others
to follow you.

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.947
Perhaps it's best
if we mail you your diploma

01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:30.817
and that you not attend
the ceremony.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.392
I don't know if i
can stay here anymore.

01:26:38.394 --> 01:26:40.961
Oh. Where will we go?

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:44.464
We?

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:50.470
Uh, I've been praying about it.

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:52.839
About us.

01:26:52.841 --> 01:27:00.347
I told god how I feel about you
and how much you mean to me.

01:27:00.349 --> 01:27:02.282
And you know what?

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.921
I was consumed
with nothing but peace.

01:27:07.923 --> 01:27:11.258
Pure peace.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:16.797
I love you.

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.399
I love you, too.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.468
And be not conformed
to this world:

01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:58.705
But be you transformed
by the renewing of your mind,

01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:04.511
that you may prove
that good, glorious,

01:28:04.513 --> 01:28:07.547
and perfect will of god.

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:12.886
That you may know that good,
acceptable,

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:15.622
and perfect will of god.

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:51.658
- Which would you prefer to have?
- Frosted flakes or fruit loops?

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.493
Well, obviously fruit loops.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:54.728
Why? Why obviously?

01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:57.497
Well, you're a fruit loop.

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.919
There you are.

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:20.987
Are you okay?

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:24.524
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.564
Okay, got 'em.

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.702
You get everything?

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.070
Mm-hmm.

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.843
These are going to storage.

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:53.120
Well, so you can have
a little more room
for your shoes?

01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:53.787
Shut up.

01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:56.823
I have never seen anyone
with more shoes than you.

01:29:56.825 --> 01:29:59.793
You can never have
too many shoes.

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.707
Get those out of here.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:33.894
Hello?

01:30:33.896 --> 01:30:35.695
<i> Hi.</i>

01:30:40.135 --> 01:30:42.636
Hi.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:45.906
<i> How are you?</i>

01:30:45.908 --> 01:30:48.041
Good.

01:30:48.043 --> 01:30:50.110
I finished school.

01:30:50.112 --> 01:30:53.947
But I'm no longer
on their path.

01:30:54.882 --> 01:30:59.119
<i> So what path</i>
<i> are you on now?</i>

01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:00.086
My own.

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:04.558
<i> I'm going to be the pastor</i>
<i> of my own church.</i>

01:31:08.664 --> 01:31:11.498
Why are you calling?

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.799
Um...

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.769
I, uh...

01:31:15.771 --> 01:31:18.104
I got the picture
you sent of olly.

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:21.174
<i> I know it was months ago,</i>
<i> but I didn't respond.</i>

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:24.077
<i> So how is she?</i>

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:27.514
Oh, she's getting old.

01:31:27.516 --> 01:31:28.849
But she's okay.

01:31:28.851 --> 01:31:29.649
She has this

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:32.519
<i> stuffed animal that she</i>
<i> carries around with her now</i>

01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:35.555
<i> everywhere she goes</i>
<i> like it's her baby.</i>

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:42.662
Bennett...

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:46.800
I should tell you
before someone else does.

01:31:46.802 --> 01:31:48.802
I'm engaged.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:53.673
To a...
Really amazing woman.

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:56.643
Now, I know
what you're thinking because

01:31:56.645 --> 01:31:59.079
<i> I asked myself the same thing--</i>

01:31:59.081 --> 01:32:00.514
<i> am I really in love with her</i>

01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:05.151
<i> or am I only doing this</i>
<i> to be right in god's eyes?</i>

01:32:05.153 --> 01:32:10.690
<i> And I'm truly</i>
<i> in love with her, Bennett.</i>

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:15.295
God went to the root
of my same sex desires

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:16.997
and he uprooted them.

01:32:16.999 --> 01:32:21.001
He demonstrated
that they were abnormal.

01:32:21.003 --> 01:32:21.801
<i> Michael...</i>

01:32:21.803 --> 01:32:26.640
<i> I'm really glad</i>
<i> you think you're happy.</i>

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.743
And I wish you all the best.

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:32.312
I really do.
I think you know that.

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:36.950
<i> But I have no idea</i>
<i> why you would call me up</i>

01:32:36.952 --> 01:32:39.819
<i> and use words like "abnormal."</i>

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:45.559
<i> I'm so sorry for the way</i>
<i> that things went down.</i>

01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:48.762
<i> But just because we don't</i>

01:32:48.764 --> 01:32:49.663
share certain beliefs,

01:32:49.665 --> 01:32:54.868
it doesn't mean that
we can't still be friends.

01:32:57.071 --> 01:33:00.006
I'll always be your friend.

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:05.245
<i> And I really hope</i>
<i> that this path</i>

01:33:05.247 --> 01:33:08.348
<i> takes you where you wanna go.</i>

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:12.819
But I also hope that...

01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:15.889
As you're setting out
to help other people...

01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:20.594
<i> That you really take some time</i>
<i> to help yourself.</i>

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:26.132
<i> I-i am. I...</i>

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:29.636
<i> I'm not gonna sit here</i>
<i> and say that I know</i>

01:33:29.638 --> 01:33:33.206
<i> I'll be this way</i>
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:36.876
We're always changing, evolving.

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:40.246
And I'm open to that.

01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:47.253
Then...

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:51.725
I guess nothing's
really changed.

01:33:51.727 --> 01:33:54.928
<i> Yeah.</i>

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:58.398
