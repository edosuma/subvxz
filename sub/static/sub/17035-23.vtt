Terrific party.

If you have to have a party
with store-bought food,

00:12.813 --> 00:14.682
this was the way to do it.

Can I toss these
or did you want to wash them?

Oh, ick, Nancy, no,
of course, toss them.

That kid inside, he got through
four years of college,

00:34.602 --> 00:36.237
which --
let's just say it --

00:36.270 --> 00:37.438
was a real nail-biter.

You don't need to tell me.

No, I love him, but he needs
to get a job and move out.

I'm gonna kill him or me

when I open the cereal box,

Well, that's not
gonna happen,

'cause we're gonna have
ground rules

01:19.680 --> 01:22.316
Yeah, right.
We tried ground rules before.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.651
Remember how that
worked out?

01:23.684 --> 01:24.818
Like when we drew up
a contract

01:24.852 --> 01:27.588
that he had to take a bath
every other day if he wanted TV.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.190
Well, he was 5 years old.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.524
He signed his name
with an X.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.693
I'm not sure
it was legally binding.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.927
Well, we should've been
more concerned

01:33.961 --> 01:36.630
that our 5-year-old could only
sign his name with an X --

01:36.664 --> 01:38.399
and he's the one
we read to.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.734
Well, look, he's not 5 anymore.
He's a man.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.637

he'll act like one.

No, I still want him
to get a job,

to get out of my house.

we paid our bills off on time

That was our Europe.

an amazing experience.

Uploading my résumé

14:47.287 --> 14:49.622
Got to get me a job before
all the good ones are gone.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.225
Wait,
you had your passport.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.226
You were all set to go.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.095
Yeah, I'm not going.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.463
But you were so determined.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.465
You marched angrily
through the hall.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.001
No, I thought about
what Dad was saying,

15:01.034 --> 15:02.335
and he's right.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.138
I had fun for 23 years,
but it's over now.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.439
It is what it is.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.241
Think I'd be good
at selling tie clips?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.142
Also, what are tie clips?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.643
I thought they were,
like, clip-on ties,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.479
but apparently
that's a whole other thing.

You have the rest
of your life to sell tie clips,

the world because it's amazing.

but I've seen pictures.

Kenny's already at the airport.

The flight leaves at 4:00.

for Europe?

I'll get your bag ready.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.004
Wait, is that stuff clean
or dirty?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.371
Who cares?
French people smell bad --

15:38.405 --> 15:39.706
everybody loves that
about them.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.342
Jeans, boxers.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.077
Am I really doing this?
What about Dad?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.245
I'll take care of Dad.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.314
Oh! Coat.
Coat.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.682
And, um, umbrella.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.319
Book! Gonna need a book
for the plane.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.720
Ooh, I got one.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.588
Okay, this is written
as a fictional conversation

15:55.622 --> 15:56.589
between a woman
and her uterus,

15:56.623 --> 15:57.657
but it's really funny.

Neck pillow!

16:01.094 --> 16:02.595
Where's your toothbrush?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.031
Can't bring a toothbrush.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.165
No, that's toothpaste.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.400
What would possibly be the
problem with a toothbrush?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.635
My God, I can think
of three different ways

16:08.668 --> 16:10.603
to kill someone
with a toothbrush.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.006
Brick, Axl's taking
your toothbrush to Europe.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.309
What's going on?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.511
Don't talk,
just listen to me.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.147
You can talk
after I get it all out,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.182
but you have
to let me finish first.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.151
I love you
and I support you

16:24.184 --> 16:26.053
and I back you
on a ton of stuff,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.754
stuff that I don't even
agree with you about,

16:27.787 --> 16:28.621
like that whole thing

16:28.655 --> 16:29.856
with Ron Donahue
and the giant spatula.

16:29.889 --> 16:34.327
And the caves -- nobody wanted
to do that, and all these years,

16:34.361 --> 16:36.729
you won't let anybody buy drinks
or snacks at the movies.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.365
And I always say,
"Your father's right.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.699
These prices are crazy."

16:39.732 --> 16:41.301
But here's the thing --

16:41.334 --> 16:43.736
you can't get the Reese's
Peanut Butter four pack

16:43.770 --> 16:45.072
at the grocery store.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.273
You can only get it
at the movies,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.374
and so you pay a premium.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.375
And I think that's fair,

16:48.408 --> 16:49.776
but it's important to you,

16:49.809 --> 16:52.279
so I'm fine smuggling in
crappy snacks.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.281
But I'm not fine
with this.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.116
Axl needs to go to Europe.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.684
I'm not talking about
letting him go.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.352
I'm saying
he needs to go.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.288
This might be the only chance
he ever gets.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.789
He needs to go, Mike.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.125
I will happily eat
off-brand peanut-butter cups

17:05.158 --> 17:08.561

but he needs to go.

Oh, my God,

17:16.403 --> 17:17.537
You are so stubborn.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.072
Just let him have fun.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.540
It's his last summer.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.175
Exactly.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.577
After this, he moves into
an apartment, then a house.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.413
He'll have his own family.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.081
And that's it.

17:28.115 --> 17:32.152
I thought we'd at least have him
for the summer, you know?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.221
We'd maybe, uh,
you know, watch some games,

17:34.254 --> 17:37.290
shoot some hoops.

Why'd you park the 'Bago

18:08.888 --> 18:09.889
Well, there was a truck
in my usual spot.

all the way down the block.
