WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:03.534
<i>Two balls and
two strikes on Hernandez.</i>

00:03.924 --> 00:05.583
<i>And there's a well-placed bunt!</i>

00:05.668 --> 00:07.298
Why did he hit the ball
like that?

00:07.731 --> 00:10.811
So that is called a bunt.
It's uh, it's tactical.

00:10.896 --> 00:12.962
It allows the guy on first
to get over to second.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.213
Okay.
Who came up with the word "bunt"?

00:15.298 --> 00:17.530
Sounds like something
you'd need to see a surgeon for.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.299
David,
this is an important game.

00:20.384 --> 00:21.533
You told me
you could get into this.

00:21.617 --> 00:23.187
I was referring to
the pizza.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.760
But, also, the game.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.806
What do we have
here?

00:29.917 --> 00:32.125
I seem to have
stumbled into some sort

00:32.211 --> 00:33.788
of gentlemen's cavern.

00:33.873 --> 00:36.088
Hey, thanks for letting me
stay here tonight, Mrs. Rose,

00:36.173 --> 00:37.693
When David told me
he wanted to install

00:37.778 --> 00:39.273
a Japanese toilet
at my place,

00:39.358 --> 00:41.166
he neglected to mention
that it would involve

00:41.252 --> 00:43.387
- taking out a wall.
- It was in the email.

00:43.472 --> 00:44.594
Also, you will be
thanking me

00:44.679 --> 00:47.372
when you experience the heated,
motion-sensor toilet seat.

00:47.457 --> 00:50.099
So, David, I take
it you'll be employed as cheerleader

00:50.184 --> 00:52.887
for whatever
televised sporting event

00:52.972 --> 00:55.120
is unfolding
for the remainder of the day?

00:55.204 --> 00:58.994
Alas, this is Patrick's day.
We're doing what Patrick wants.

00:59.079 --> 01:00.964
- Yes!
- Wow,

01:01.049 --> 01:02.826
someone's enjoying their day!

01:03.096 --> 01:05.388
Sorry.
Just... cleared the bases.

01:05.751 --> 01:09.492
It turns out Herb Ertlinger,
the great fruit vintner,

01:09.577 --> 01:11.853
is rabid fan of the Crows
movie -

01:11.937 --> 01:13.362
good luck finding someone
who isn't -

01:13.446 --> 01:17.019
and he would like to
name a wine after me.

01:17.103 --> 01:18.700
- Oh my...
- They should call it a...

01:18.785 --> 01:20.634
a Moira Rosé.

01:20.745 --> 01:22.654
Yes, that's what he has
in mind.

01:23.994 --> 01:26.685
Amazing!
Congrats, Mrs. Rose!

01:26.770 --> 01:28.886
- Mm.
- What news!

01:28.970 --> 01:30.679
Yes, but he wants me
to sample

01:30.763 --> 01:33.234
the fruits of his labor
this very day!

01:33.610 --> 01:37.139
Well, this seems like a very
important moment in your life.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.254
I only wish
I could be there.

01:39.339 --> 01:40.692
I can't go alone.

01:41.209 --> 01:42.677
Well, unfortunately,

01:42.761 --> 01:44.569
I told my fiancé I'd
watch the game

01:44.654 --> 01:46.254
- with him... okay.
- Just go, David.

01:49.712 --> 01:51.514
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:51.598 --> 01:53.847
You guys might wanna rehearse
a little more next time.

01:53.931 --> 01:55.999
The extraction did feel
a bit strained.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.004
- That was you.
- Wha?

02:01.332 --> 02:02.601
Love you.

02:03.976 --> 02:05.570
<i>And a sigh of relief</i>

02:05.654 --> 02:06.959
<i>for the beleaguered bullpen...</i>

02:19.958 --> 02:21.197
There are my fierce women,

02:21.282 --> 02:22.947
ready to elevate their lives!

02:23.032 --> 02:24.974
I'm so glad you decided
to come today.

02:25.058 --> 02:27.167
Well, you pushed pretty
hard for it, Alexis.

02:27.251 --> 02:28.959
- You said you'd buy me lunch.
- Mhmm.

02:29.043 --> 02:31.708
As Elevation's official
regional brand ambassador

02:31.793 --> 02:33.759
and regional marketing
invigorator,

02:33.844 --> 02:35.141
<i>I need to ask you guys:</i>

02:35.225 --> 02:37.158
are you ready for
a total physical

02:37.243 --> 02:39.220
and emotional
transformation?

02:39.305 --> 02:42.622
- Nah, but I'll do your class.
- Mm.

02:42.891 --> 02:44.055
I didn't know they'd make us
change

02:44.139 --> 02:45.733
out of our own workout clothes.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.392
Yeah, I kinda wish
I knew that

02:47.476 --> 02:49.923
before I spent all that money
on my Lulu Limes.

02:50.007 --> 02:52.716
- Okay.
- I found a stain on my pants.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.285
Are we sure that
they clean these?

02:54.370 --> 02:56.121
- 'Kay, Stevie...
- Alexis!

02:56.206 --> 02:58.148
It's wonderful to see
all these new recruits

02:58.232 --> 02:59.581
you've brought for us
today.

02:59.854 --> 03:02.182
Leadership is thrilled with
all of your hard work.

03:02.323 --> 03:03.973
Oh my God, I'm blushing.

03:04.970 --> 03:06.902
Um, ladies, meet Citrus.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.439
Citrus runs our
East Coast wing,

03:09.524 --> 03:11.415
so we are very lucky
to have him here today.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.901
You know,
I should also tell you

03:12.986 --> 03:15.483
that he's been very impressed
with all of the work

03:15.568 --> 03:17.074
you've done for us
these past few weeks.

03:17.158 --> 03:19.130
I'm sorry, who's "he?"

03:19.535 --> 03:21.511
Oh, good point.
Who's "he"?

03:21.843 --> 03:24.083
Well, if you keep this up,
you'll find out soon enough.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.551
Twyla, Stevie, Jocelyn,
and Ronnie,

03:28.892 --> 03:30.449
have a great class.

03:31.843 --> 03:33.676
How does he know all
of our names?

03:33.761 --> 03:36.637
Am I crazy or is he really
cute?

03:36.722 --> 03:38.919
Okay, ladies,
are we ready to elevate?

03:39.004 --> 03:40.953
- Nah.
- What if I just wait in the car

03:41.038 --> 03:42.488
until you're ready for lunch?
'Cause I'm just getting

03:42.572 --> 03:44.035
a really weird vibe
from this place.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.862
Stevie, we've talked
about this.

03:45.947 --> 03:48.194
You are a businesswoman now
and part of that means

03:48.279 --> 03:50.456
that you need to be like
physically and mentally sharp.

03:50.541 --> 03:52.268
And also, I get paid for
everyone that signs up,

03:52.352 --> 03:53.965
so mm, mm, mm.

03:55.451 --> 03:59.592
All right, my Elevators,

03:59.924 --> 04:03.247
we are ascending,
not depending.

04:03.332 --> 04:04.970
All our troubles,
all our worries,

04:05.055 --> 04:08.180
we're going to elevate
above them.

04:08.324 --> 04:11.271
Can I get an 'oh yeah'
if you're up on my level!

04:11.406 --> 04:13.115
Oh yeah!

04:13.750 --> 04:15.442
Oh yeah...

04:22.337 --> 04:24.124
Hey, Johnny.

04:24.562 --> 04:27.215
Listen, I don't wanna creep
you out or anything,

04:27.299 --> 04:29.545
but I was just peering
into your son's bedroom...

04:29.630 --> 04:31.467
Okay, not off to a good
start, Roland.

04:31.552 --> 04:33.351
Well, do you know that
Patrick's sitting in there

04:33.435 --> 04:35.775
- all by himself?
- Uh, yes, I'm aware.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.322
He's spending the night
with us.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.456
Patrick is practically family
now.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.756
Ah.
Have you told him that?

04:43.281 --> 04:45.776
Well, no, I haven't told him.

04:45.861 --> 04:48.563
I mean, I haven't exactly
said it out loud.

04:48.648 --> 04:50.368
Yeah... I don't know, Johnny.

04:50.453 --> 04:52.552
Not having the big father/
son-in-law chat

04:52.673 --> 04:55.342
feels like a missed opportunity
to lay down some laws.

04:55.572 --> 04:59.030
Maybe Patrick should get
"the talk" from old Uncle Roland.

04:59.114 --> 05:01.498
'Kay, nobody's having a talk
with Uncle Roland.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.317
Look, everything is fine.

05:03.402 --> 05:06.253
If I feel like having a talk,
I'll have a talk.

05:06.338 --> 05:07.665
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:07.750 --> 05:09.080
I have a few things
to attend to.

05:09.165 --> 05:12.258
I remember when Jocelyn's dad
gave me the talk.

05:12.392 --> 05:14.895
I mean, he was trying to talk
me out of getting married,

05:14.980 --> 05:17.174
but she was 9 months pregnant
at the time,

05:17.274 --> 05:19.168
so he really didn't have a leg
to stand on.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.254
But I'll tell you,

05:20.339 --> 05:23.269
I could not get out of that
sauna fast enough.

05:23.370 --> 05:24.969
No way!

05:26.075 --> 05:28.254
The kid's just in there
by himself, Johnny.

05:28.339 --> 05:30.080
Something to think about.

05:34.805 --> 05:36.897
Okay,
so how did this happen?

05:36.982 --> 05:38.697
I'm shocked he'd give you
a second chance

05:38.782 --> 05:40.429
after that train wreck
of a commercial.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.557
Mark my words, David,
Herb...

05:42.743 --> 05:44.066
- Ertlinger.
- Mm-hmm.

05:44.151 --> 05:46.300
Won't be the last we see to
clamber out of the woodwork

05:46.384 --> 05:48.564
now that I have a hit film
on my hands.

05:48.827 --> 05:53.084
Spines tend to liquidate
in the presence of success.

05:53.363 --> 05:54.880
Speaking of.

05:54.965 --> 05:56.122
Herb!

05:56.207 --> 05:57.628
ERT-linger.
ERT. LINGER.

05:57.713 --> 06:00.364
- Herb Ertlinger.
- Nailed it first try.

06:01.937 --> 06:04.619
Hey, bygones be bygones
about the TV spot.

06:04.704 --> 06:05.837
At least the print ad
worked out.

06:05.921 --> 06:07.260
Pretty hard to mess up
one of those!

06:07.344 --> 06:09.006
Clearly you haven't seen
the heartburn ads

06:09.091 --> 06:12.048
- she shot with Anne Geddes.
- Herb,

06:12.133 --> 06:14.197
I would like
to introduce you

06:14.282 --> 06:16.819
to a potential vendor.
This is my son, David Rose.

06:16.904 --> 06:19.082
I'm sure you've heard of
Rose Apothecary?

06:19.167 --> 06:20.745
I have not, no.

06:20.830 --> 06:23.485
But I'd be happy to discuss
a buy with...

06:23.633 --> 06:25.161
whatever store this is,

06:25.246 --> 06:27.946
- if it means something to you.
- Okay.

06:28.031 --> 06:30.081
I think we might need to sample
the product first.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.341
Ah!

06:31.732 --> 06:34.448
My wife and I got a real kick
out of that Crows movie.

06:34.615 --> 06:39.041
So we would love to make
our Moira Rosé

06:39.342 --> 06:41.209
an exclusive
and limited release.

06:41.294 --> 06:42.863
This is what we're thinking
for the label.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.661
Well, hello!

06:44.746 --> 06:47.541
Who is she and how do we get
a mouthful of her?!

06:47.629 --> 06:49.705
Now, it's important that
you believe

06:49.790 --> 06:51.045
in the product
you're selling,

06:51.129 --> 06:52.699
so we have a few options:

06:52.783 --> 06:54.527
there's the strawberry-peach,

06:54.820 --> 06:56.599
the ground fruits blend,

06:56.787 --> 07:01.548
and... a lovely banana rosé.
Huh?

07:02.357 --> 07:04.689
- Mmm. Rich in potassium.
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.774 --> 07:06.850
So, uh, sample at your
leisure.

07:06.935 --> 07:08.653
I'll come back with some
coffee grounds

07:08.738 --> 07:10.616
and a cheese board.

07:10.708 --> 07:15.237
Again, we are so thrilled
to have you here, Moira.

07:15.619 --> 07:18.376
- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.847
Poor thing.

07:21.554 --> 07:24.862
Okay. Here is to being able
to share

07:24.947 --> 07:26.815
the perks of the industry
with you.

07:26.900 --> 07:27.928
Salut.

07:28.013 --> 07:29.205
Cheers.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.064
Oh, I had my reservations
about banana.

07:35.149 --> 07:36.963
Um,
that's strawberry-peach.

07:37.048 --> 07:39.473
Oh dear, it tastes like
Amoxicillin.

07:43.094 --> 07:45.274
This one's burning my throat.
These are terrible!

07:45.358 --> 07:47.051
Well, we have to pick one,
David.

07:47.136 --> 07:49.221
Do we? You really want people
associating your name

07:49.306 --> 07:51.460
with this... laundry detergent?

07:51.545 --> 07:53.195
I would never sell this
at my store.

07:53.279 --> 07:54.802
Okay, enough.

07:57.108 --> 07:58.538
Whew.

07:58.893 --> 08:01.028
Now I'm getting notes
of tomato.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.167
Ugh.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.523
<i>Bottom of
the 8th, Tigers down by one.</i>

08:06.832 --> 08:08.540
<i>Great pitching duel today...</i>

08:08.729 --> 08:10.263
Oh, hey, Mr. Rose.

08:11.137 --> 08:13.405
Patrick! Uh, yeah,
I was gonna say hello,

08:13.490 --> 08:15.428
I, uh, didn't wanna interrupt.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.552
No, no, not at all.
I'm just watching the game.

08:17.637 --> 08:19.290
Hey, do you want some pizza?

08:19.464 --> 08:22.249
Uh... yeah, I could go
for some 'za.

08:23.445 --> 08:24.487
Ordered it a while ago,

08:24.571 --> 08:25.966
so it might be a bit cold
by now, but...

08:26.050 --> 08:28.453
Oh, that's okay,
cold pizza can be good.

08:28.538 --> 08:30.960
- Mm.
- Hot pizza's good.

08:31.931 --> 08:34.798
Too-hot pizza - not so good.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.477
- I got that happening.
- Yeah.

08:36.562 --> 08:38.211
Oh, is this thin crust?

08:38.328 --> 08:39.850
I think it's just regular.

08:39.933 --> 08:42.501
Oh yeah, well, I love
a regular crust.

08:43.498 --> 08:45.085
<i>..Jackson on
the mound.</i>

08:45.170 --> 08:47.744
Yeah, cheese, tomato sauce,
bread.

08:48.419 --> 08:50.077
Can't beat that combination.

08:51.278 --> 08:54.063
<i>Here's the
wind-up - and the pitch!</i>

08:54.148 --> 08:56.764
You know, speaking of great
combinations, you and David...

08:56.849 --> 08:58.369
- Oh!
- Oh, uh...

08:58.454 --> 09:00.146
did we get another hit?

09:00.231 --> 09:01.823
That's the other team,
unfortunately.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.582
Oh... boy. Almost got
a glove on it, huh?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.020
That would've been good.

09:07.105 --> 09:09.139
You know, I was gonna say,
you and David...

09:09.224 --> 09:11.764
Oh, he and Mrs. Rose went
to some wine tasting thing.

09:11.849 --> 09:13.753
Oh, he went with Mrs. Rose,

09:13.851 --> 09:16.013
yeah, the woman I'm married to?

09:17.100 --> 09:19.772
You know, I was just flashing
on you and David...

09:19.857 --> 09:21.815
Oh, come on!
This is not happening.

09:21.899 --> 09:23.608
What is happening?!

09:23.996 --> 09:27.146
Oh, you know, we,
we can talk about this later.

09:27.231 --> 09:29.792
It's not, it doesn't really
matter. Fellas!

09:29.877 --> 09:31.330
Ugh!

09:31.415 --> 09:33.922
Yes, Stevie!
You're crushing it.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.786
You're breaking through
and I can see it!

09:35.881 --> 09:37.222
Ronnie...

09:38.005 --> 09:39.388
You too!

09:39.472 --> 09:42.107
- Twyla, where are we going?
- Up!

09:42.192 --> 09:43.479
And what're we leaving
behind?

09:43.564 --> 09:45.570
Everything and everyone!

09:45.655 --> 09:47.482
Yes! Push past
those demons!

09:47.567 --> 09:51.193
Leave it behind you
as we ascend to the gateway.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.577
Jocelyn, do you see it?
I think so!

09:54.788 --> 09:57.294
And... class!

09:58.794 --> 10:00.565
Great job, everyon!

10:01.885 --> 10:03.888
And remember,
I wanna see all of you

10:03.973 --> 10:06.019
signing up for that gateway!

10:06.104 --> 10:07.416
Good work.

10:08.227 --> 10:10.880
Oh yeah, I feel amazing.

10:11.094 --> 10:12.654
Does anyone wanna sign up
with me?

10:12.739 --> 10:13.944
I'm happy to share a tent!

10:14.028 --> 10:16.783
If babies are allowed,
I am in.

10:17.456 --> 10:20.601
Consider me a convert.
I'm gonna go grab a couple

10:20.686 --> 10:23.085
of those Elevation Hydration
bottles.

10:23.170 --> 10:25.633
So, Stevie, what did you
think?

10:26.204 --> 10:28.152
Okay, yeah, I didn't hate it,

10:28.271 --> 10:29.612
but I mean,

10:29.696 --> 10:32.222
does anybody even know
what "the gateway" is?

10:32.307 --> 10:34.288
Um, well, I think it's pretty
obvious...

10:36.796 --> 10:38.353
Although, if it'd make you
feel better,

10:38.438 --> 10:39.696
I can totally like clarify

10:39.781 --> 10:41.427
some of the language
with Citrus.

10:43.836 --> 10:47.079
Yeah. Um, hey! Citrus?

10:47.312 --> 10:48.462
Yeah?

10:48.547 --> 10:51.140
Well, first of all, so great
to finally experience

10:51.225 --> 10:52.258
what we're marketing.

10:52.369 --> 10:54.122
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed it, Alexis.

10:54.818 --> 10:56.983
Although,
from a marketing perspective,

10:57.068 --> 10:58.897
I think it'd be really
helpful to just like...

10:58.982 --> 11:01.542
clarify some of the language
that we're using.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.625
Okay. Like what?

11:03.736 --> 11:04.863
Well, first of all,

11:04.948 --> 11:08.216
I noticed that you referred to,
um, like "demons" a lot.

11:08.478 --> 11:11.952
- Well, we all have demons!
- Yes, and I get that.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.608
Carbs. Am I right?

11:14.451 --> 11:17.081
Right. But I'm also talking
about actual demons.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.214
Yes...

11:19.299 --> 11:21.315
Okay. I guess I'm just asking
for the people

11:21.399 --> 11:22.920
signing up right now, um,

11:23.005 --> 11:25.276
is the gateway like
a symbol for something

11:25.391 --> 11:27.551
or is it like an actual
gateway?

11:27.934 --> 11:30.146
Oh! It's, it's a symbol.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.596
Okay, good.

11:32.694 --> 11:36.213
But it's also a literal
gateway into the sky.

11:37.175 --> 11:38.594
Gotcha.

11:38.804 --> 11:40.465
I hope that cleared
everything up.

11:40.972 --> 11:43.442
- Totally.
- Great.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.862
I'm just signing up.
I can't...

11:46.947 --> 11:49.705
Oh... it's gonna be good.

11:54.609 --> 11:55.815
Hey, Jocelyn?

11:55.902 --> 11:57.475
Can I see that sign-up sheet
for a sec?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.212
Oh, I haven't finished
filling out my social...

11:59.296 --> 12:00.319
Oh, that's okay.

12:00.404 --> 12:01.800
I'm just gonna go and destroy
this right now,

12:01.884 --> 12:03.151
because I get the creeping
suspicion

12:03.235 --> 12:05.367
that this place is like,
not okay.

12:05.452 --> 12:07.748
Like I feel like this is more
than just a fitness class.

12:07.914 --> 12:10.418
- What do you think it is?
- Um, I think it's a cult.

12:10.616 --> 12:11.913
And like
not the good kind.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.575
Not like when you go
to India to follow

12:13.659 --> 12:15.942
a long-haired, sexy man around
for a couple months

12:16.027 --> 12:18.135
and then come home with
a bangin' yoga body.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.430
Yeah, if only someone had
pointed out how weird this was

12:20.515 --> 12:21.626
from the beginning.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.454
Alexis, can I still go on
the trip?

12:23.538 --> 12:24.957
I'm not saying that
I need it.

12:25.042 --> 12:27.358
It's just last weekend
I snuck Roland Jr.

12:27.443 --> 12:28.624
Into the ball room at Ikea,
just so

12:28.708 --> 12:30.638
I could eat a meatball
by myself.

12:30.806 --> 12:32.599
No. No. No one is going on
the trip.

12:32.684 --> 12:35.152
And I am so sorry for making
you guys sign up for this.

12:35.237 --> 12:36.916
Well, I'm keeping
the Hydration bottles.

12:37.001 --> 12:39.035
I can just dump out
the crystal water.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.080
Just a heads up, you guys,
they're almost sold out

12:42.165 --> 12:44.337
of the "nocturnal affirmation"
cassette tapes, so...

12:44.422 --> 12:45.773
- Twy...
- Now I just need to buy

12:45.858 --> 12:48.079
one of their cassette players.
Because you have to make sure

12:48.163 --> 12:49.836
they're playing at the right
speed when you're sleeping.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.669
Twy, this is a cult.
I brought you to a cult.

12:53.075 --> 12:54.909
Oh my gosh,
did you not know that?

12:55.028 --> 12:56.714
My mom tried to take me
to the gateway

12:56.799 --> 12:58.007
for spring break one year.

12:58.092 --> 13:00.377
I just thought I was supporting
your career.

13:00.462 --> 13:02.580
Ugh, how did I fall for this?

13:02.664 --> 13:05.301
Cults prey on sad, weak,
vulnerable people.

13:05.389 --> 13:06.890
I'll try not to take
that personally.

13:06.993 --> 13:09.331
I've just been so desperate
to like throw myself into work,

13:09.416 --> 13:10.854
and I clearly missed all
the signs

13:10.939 --> 13:12.469
and now I've like endangered
all of us.

13:12.587 --> 13:14.772
Well, there's an exit sign
right there.

13:14.883 --> 13:17.623
Yup, but the arrow's pointing
straight up.

13:18.409 --> 13:21.055
There was an emergency exit
in the change room.

13:21.388 --> 13:24.501
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:24.586 --> 13:25.973
Yeah.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.823
Ugh! Okay, you know what?
I'm making a blend.

13:33.908 --> 13:36.304
Yes. Make us a nice
Moira-lot...

13:36.389 --> 13:38.319
or a Moira Rose-ling.

13:43.055 --> 13:46.908
Hey, not to be too effusive,
but I'd call that one potable.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.590
I have had worst things
in my mouth.

13:50.007 --> 13:53.345
I'm so happy that I wrestled
you away today

13:53.430 --> 13:55.938
for this oenological escapade.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.024
I finally have you all
to myself, David.

13:59.151 --> 14:02.443
When's the last time you and I
had a whole day together

14:02.528 --> 14:04.968
with nary a care in the world?

14:05.117 --> 14:07.137
I mean, I am in the middle of
planning a wedding,

14:07.222 --> 14:09.923
while also building
a successful retail empire.

14:10.008 --> 14:11.361
Yes, you are.

14:11.832 --> 14:14.043
Then grant me this precious
moment -

14:14.127 --> 14:16.205
before there's a ring
on your finger -

14:16.290 --> 14:20.562
to say chin chin to you
and your husband-to-be.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.668
This feels remarkably
selfless.

14:23.265 --> 14:26.164
You and Patrick are two
good grapes.

14:26.249 --> 14:27.297
Hmm...

14:27.443 --> 14:29.232
Different notes,
different tannins,

14:29.317 --> 14:33.633
but... together, you've managed
to make one perfect blend.

14:34.321 --> 14:36.540
- Thank you.
- That being said...

14:36.625 --> 14:40.202
- Oh my God.
- If I may impart a...

14:40.464 --> 14:42.941
slice of marital sagacity:

14:43.229 --> 14:44.810
you and I,

14:45.227 --> 14:47.124
we're two potent grapes.

14:47.209 --> 14:49.190
You know, there's a lot of
your father in Patrick.

14:49.275 --> 14:50.317
Don't need that.

14:50.402 --> 14:52.399
But just because their notes
are subtle

14:52.571 --> 14:55.562
doesn't mean they require
any less attention.

14:55.647 --> 14:57.826
Says the woman who literally
convinced me

14:57.910 --> 14:59.747
to leave my partner alone
at home,

14:59.832 --> 15:01.010
watching a baseball game.

15:01.095 --> 15:02.752
You know
I'm right.

15:02.899 --> 15:05.661
Your father and I have produced
beautiful wine together

15:05.746 --> 15:08.208
- for over forty years.
- Ew.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.099
And I have absolutely
no doubt

15:10.184 --> 15:11.754
that your relationship
with Patrick

15:11.839 --> 15:14.826
is going to get even better
with age.

15:16.379 --> 15:19.116
Okay, I hope we've landed on
something,

15:19.201 --> 15:21.505
because all I have left
is this cherry ice wine

15:21.790 --> 15:23.383
and I think it might be corked.

15:23.468 --> 15:25.603
Nope. My David has put
together

15:25.688 --> 15:28.960
- a delicious blend right here.
- Mmhmm-hmm!

15:31.289 --> 15:33.291
Ugh. No. That's not the one
we picked.

15:33.376 --> 15:34.919
- Huh?
- That's not the one we picked.

15:35.004 --> 15:37.152
What? Well, let's retrace
our steps.

15:38.339 --> 15:39.734
No.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.743
How many combinations
can there be?

15:42.841 --> 15:43.879
No.

15:43.968 --> 15:45.917
<i>We'll be back to
the ball game right after...</i>

15:46.001 --> 15:47.839
Yeah, I guess I don't need
to turn the volume down

15:47.923 --> 15:50.811
- for these commercial breaks.
- Oh, whatever works for you.

15:52.628 --> 15:53.997
It's just I thought you
had something

15:54.081 --> 15:55.520
that you wanted to talk about?

15:55.605 --> 15:59.535
Oh, no, just wondering
what the inflation was

15:59.620 --> 16:00.940
on concessions these days,

16:01.025 --> 16:03.972
'cause it's been years
since I've been to a ball game.

16:04.392 --> 16:05.633
Well, it's highway robbery.

16:05.717 --> 16:08.669
Yeah, you got that right.

16:09.581 --> 16:11.552
It just sorta seemed like you
wanted to talk about David

16:11.636 --> 16:12.863
for a second.

16:12.948 --> 16:14.485
Felt like that's where
you were goin'.

16:14.570 --> 16:15.922
No, I...

16:16.295 --> 16:18.518
sure. Yeah, I can talk about
David.

16:19.196 --> 16:21.083
Yeah, my son...

16:22.864 --> 16:25.281
Who, uh, you will be...

16:25.940 --> 16:28.905
walking down the aisle
with very soon.

16:29.245 --> 16:31.995
Well, technically, you won't be
walking with him...

16:32.090 --> 16:34.441
down the aisle, but...
but um...

16:35.568 --> 16:37.399
Mr. Rose, I don't wanna
cut you off,

16:37.787 --> 16:39.296
but um...

16:43.348 --> 16:45.032
I'm glad we have a minute
to talk.

16:46.566 --> 16:49.050
Because I, I hope it goes
without saying that,

16:49.348 --> 16:51.834
as lucky as I feel
to have met David,

16:52.762 --> 16:56.171
I also feel incredibly lucky
to be joining your family.

16:56.847 --> 16:58.277
Huh.

16:59.129 --> 17:00.732
I love your son

17:01.637 --> 17:04.172
and I will always do everything
I can

17:04.608 --> 17:06.214
to respect him

17:06.736 --> 17:09.175
and to protect him
from all of the things in life

17:09.261 --> 17:10.544
that can set him off.

17:11.186 --> 17:13.468
And there are many, many things
that can set him off...

17:13.553 --> 17:16.628
Oh, I'm aware,
yeah.

17:17.671 --> 17:20.173
Um... oh boy, that...

17:21.747 --> 17:22.939
pretty much covers it.

17:23.023 --> 17:26.354
Uh, I was only gonna say
that I...

17:26.875 --> 17:30.139
I hope you treat him with...
respect,

17:30.716 --> 17:32.115
which you just said
you would,

17:32.224 --> 17:35.571
and, of course...
I already knew it.

17:37.874 --> 17:39.689
I'm glad we had this talk,
Mr. Rose.

17:39.774 --> 17:42.108
Me too. Me too.

17:45.002 --> 17:46.519
All right.

17:50.322 --> 17:51.694
<i>Iverson at
the plate,</i>

17:51.779 --> 17:53.485
<i>and here comes the pitch!</i>

17:53.776 --> 17:56.210
<i>Iverson with a...</i>
- Oh... Oh! It's going...

17:56.295 --> 17:58.006
GOING! GONE!

17:58.091 --> 17:59.126
Oh!

17:59.211 --> 18:03.093
- Whoa-ho!
- Hey!

18:04.364 --> 18:05.643
Wow!

18:07.000 --> 18:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

18:15.212 --> 18:17.810
So, it was this one?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.335
Um, let me just triple check.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.114
No.
No, it's not.

18:26.199 --> 18:27.645
Did it oxidize?

18:27.730 --> 18:30.155
Is that why we can't recognize
the tastes?

18:30.240 --> 18:33.423
Okay, if neither of you can
remember which one it was,

18:33.508 --> 18:35.942
maybe we just,
we just call this off.

18:36.027 --> 18:40.240
The wife and I had reservations
at the Elmdale Inn an hour ago.

18:40.325 --> 18:41.914
It was strawberry-radish.

18:42.017 --> 18:43.442
We don't do anything
with radishes.

18:43.526 --> 18:45.152
Ooh, maybe you should.
That sounds refreshing.

18:45.236 --> 18:46.894
We're not making 
a new wine!

18:46.979 --> 18:49.963
There's no need to raise
your voices, Herbert.

18:50.058 --> 18:53.810
Okay, speaking of Herbert,
is it Herbert or Erbert?

18:53.895 --> 18:56.446
Like when people say Herb
or Erb?

18:56.531 --> 18:59.170
I took the liberty of calling
your husband, Moira,

18:59.255 --> 19:01.895
because somebody has to drive
you two home

19:01.980 --> 19:03.811
and it's certainly not going
to be me.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.329
Our designated grapes!

19:07.420 --> 19:09.594
Well, I see the sampling
went well.

19:09.679 --> 19:11.379
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:11.464 --> 19:12.923
We couldn't find a wine.

19:13.016 --> 19:15.301
Well, it sorta smells
like you... found all the wine.

19:15.386 --> 19:16.700
- What?
- Yeah...

19:16.785 --> 19:20.059
Mr. Ertlinger, I hope this
doesn't stand in the way of...

19:20.144 --> 19:21.299
our doing business.

19:21.384 --> 19:23.476
Your wife ensured that
that won't be happening.

19:23.561 --> 19:26.241
Between the two of them they
could not find a single wine

19:26.326 --> 19:28.219
they were willing to put
Moira's name on.

19:28.304 --> 19:30.660
- I said radish!
- We...

19:31.705 --> 19:34.670
Could you please escort
your family out of here?

19:34.755 --> 19:36.935
I am very late
for a dinner!

19:37.020 --> 19:40.222
I am offering a major apology
if that'll help.

19:42.977 --> 19:45.754
Okay. I take it keys are in
your purse, Moira?

19:45.839 --> 19:47.439
- Es in a nokia...
- I'm gonna uh...

19:47.523 --> 19:49.963
I'm gonna start the car.
Okay, great!

19:50.048 --> 19:51.924
- Yeah.
- What?!

20:03.220 --> 20:05.209
How was your class,
Alexis?

20:05.963 --> 20:09.174
Um, it was a big success.
Thank you for asking.

20:09.349 --> 20:10.478
Everyone had a great time

20:10.563 --> 20:12.505
and the clients were like
super impressed.

20:12.638 --> 20:13.925
Oh, that's good.

20:14.036 --> 20:15.724
I wonder if that means they'll
give you priority boarding

20:15.808 --> 20:17.804
when you enter the gateway?
Oh my God,

20:17.889 --> 20:19.128
Stevie did this,
didn't she?

20:19.213 --> 20:21.696
Now, do the step machines
actually lift off the ground,

20:21.781 --> 20:24.246
or are the step machines just
there to help you practice

20:24.331 --> 20:26.392
for when you walk onto
the spaceship?

20:26.477 --> 20:28.156
Come on, David,
she didn't know.

20:28.241 --> 20:29.904
- Thank you!
- But now that you do,

20:29.989 --> 20:31.802
does it just make the journey
to the gateway

20:31.887 --> 20:34.027
- that much more meaningful?
- Okay, you know what?

20:34.112 --> 20:37.197
Honestly, this whole situation
is starting to gross me out.

20:37.282 --> 20:40.033
It's like I'm sharing a room
with my twin brothers who kiss.

20:40.134 --> 20:41.298
- Mm!
- Mm...

20:42.713 --> 20:45.071
Well, look at this!

20:45.156 --> 20:47.581
We have a full house here.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.934
Just came in to say goodnight.
That's not necessary.

20:51.019 --> 20:53.871
- John! Open, please!
- Yeah.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.750
Hey! I like sleepovers!

20:56.835 --> 20:59.062
Anyone think I might
like a sleepover?

20:59.147 --> 21:00.801
- Ew...
- Ew!

21:00.886 --> 21:03.645
You know, spending
a little extra time together

21:03.730 --> 21:05.496
is not such a bad idea
since we're...

21:05.581 --> 21:07.944
losing Alexis soon
to the gateway.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.848
- OH MY GOD-DUH!
- A simple mistake, honey.

21:11.023 --> 21:12.671
So does this happen
every night?

21:12.756 --> 21:14.796
- Um, no. No, it doesn't.
- Oh...

21:15.935 --> 21:17.317
Uh, okay.

21:17.506 --> 21:19.994
Mm! Stop!
