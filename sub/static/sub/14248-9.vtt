00:23.690 --> 00:24.987
What?

00:25.058 --> 00:26.992
l've seen that look before.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.551
Ensign Murphy
had better watch out.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.392
l happen to know
that Murphy is seeing

00:31.464 --> 00:32.761
one of the Delaney sisters.

00:32.832 --> 00:35.995
Not since Harry and Tom Paris
made their move.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.663
Harry and the Delaney sisters?

00:38.738 --> 00:40.706
He would have told me.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.005
l guess there are some things
he keeps to himself.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.237
Harry...

00:45.311 --> 00:49.441
is it true about you
and the Delaney sisters?

00:49.516 --> 00:50.778
ls what true?

00:50.850 --> 00:52.044
Come on, Harry.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.814
There aren't any secrets
on a ship this small.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.189
What have you been
telling people?

00:59.259 --> 01:02.422
Well, we did take that trip
to Venice with them.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.757
The holodeck?

01:03.830 --> 01:05.297
You got to be kidding.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.265
That lasted all of 15 minutes.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.597
Yeah, you know l've been
meaning to ask you.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.297
What happened
when you and Jenny Delaney

01:12.372 --> 01:14.203
disappeared in that gondola?

01:14.274 --> 01:16.208
Nothing.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.971
Harry, we're your friends.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.341
You can tell us.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.538
Nothing.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.444
We... talked.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.710
And then...

01:24.784 --> 01:27.514
l fell over the side.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.489
You fell out of the gondola?

01:31.558 --> 01:33.389
l think maybe Harry
wasn't quite prepared

01:33.460 --> 01:37.521
for how voracious
Jenny Delaney can be.

01:39.299 --> 01:43.099
l think it's finally
beginning to happen.

01:43.169 --> 01:46.002
Both crews getting along.

01:46.072 --> 01:49.007
That kind of bonding
should improve performance

01:49.075 --> 01:50.565
and maximize efficiency.

01:50.643 --> 01:53.043
Yes, l'm sure it will.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.047
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.207
Go ahead.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.716
Captain, we're receiving
a distress call

01:58.785 --> 01:59.979
in one of the lower
subspace bands.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.351
l'm on my way.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.947
-This is it.
-Thanks.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.260
Report, Commander.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.593
The subspace distress signal's

02:12.665 --> 02:15.862
coming from a vessel
bearing 125 mark 21.

02:15.935 --> 02:18.301
Distance: 200,000 kilometers.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.770
Captain...

02:19.839 --> 02:21.830
sensors indicate
five life-forms aboard.

02:21.908 --> 02:25.309
The vessel is altering
its course to intercept us.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.141
Go to Yellow Alert
and slow to impulse.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.477
-Hail them, Mr. Kim.
-Aye, Captain.

02:29.549 --> 02:32.484
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

02:32.552 --> 02:34.417
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.478
What is the nature
of your emergency?

02:36.556 --> 02:38.524
We have no emergency.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.082
But you're sending out
a distress call.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.628
Yes, we are.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.560
Why?

02:44.631 --> 02:46.792
Because you are in distress.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.710
l am Gathorel Labin
of the planet Sikaris.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.721
Please, let us welcome you
to our system,

04:49.789 --> 04:52.121
show you the hospitality
of our people.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.453
That's very kind of you...

04:53.526 --> 04:55.517
if l could come aboard
your ship,

04:55.595 --> 04:57.392
l have gifts for you

04:57.463 --> 05:00.591
and a proposal l hope
you will find irresistible.

05:04.270 --> 05:08.172
Mr. Tuvok, make
the necessary arrangements

05:08.241 --> 05:10.368
to receive our guest.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.277
Ah...

05:22.955 --> 05:24.582
Mr. Labin, it really
isn't necessary

05:24.657 --> 05:25.919
to go to all of this trouble.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.220
Please, call me Gath.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.885
And l promise you,
l would like nothing better

05:28.961 --> 05:32.226
than to prepare a few of our
newest delicacies for you.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.526
Ah, this will be perfect.

05:33.599 --> 05:38.332
Uh-uh, Captain, l'm serving
lunch in less than two hours.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.496
We won't be long, Neelix.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.631
This is Mr....
this is Gath.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.970
He's from Sikaris.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.068
Ooh, Sikaris.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.772
Do you know the planet?

05:47.847 --> 05:52.307
Only stories about their
incredible hospitality.

05:52.385 --> 05:55.354
Tell me,
how do you know about us?

05:55.421 --> 05:58.356
Our people are
very well-traveled.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.415
Some of them have
brought back stories

06:00.493 --> 06:01.585
about the ship of aliens

06:01.661 --> 06:03.185
from another part
of the galaxy--

06:03.262 --> 06:05.628
people lost and alone,

06:05.698 --> 06:07.859
struggling to find
their way home again.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.594
This is wonderful.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.864
And l decided
to come and meet you,

06:11.971 --> 06:13.438
and offer you respite.

06:13.506 --> 06:14.473
Respite?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.599
A vacation, if you will--

06:16.676 --> 06:19.076
get away from the confines
of the ship,

06:19.145 --> 06:21.409
enjoy the beauty
of our landscape,

06:21.481 --> 06:25.577
meet and talk with interesting,
learned people.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.346
And the crew
would certainly welcome

06:27.420 --> 06:28.819
a little shore leave, Captain.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.321
And l hear the Sikarians

06:30.390 --> 06:33.018
have a huge variety
of edible plants.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.219
lf we could collect some seeds,

06:35.294 --> 06:38.786
we'd expand
our selection significantly.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.663
Sounds like all this
would increase performance

06:41.734 --> 06:43.167
and maximize efficiency.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.863
Don't you think, Mr. Tuvok?

06:46.472 --> 06:47.939
lndeed.

06:48.007 --> 06:51.443
Well, Gath, looks like
you're getting visitors.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.207
We'll set a course
and follow you in.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.271
l could not be happier.

07:04.257 --> 07:09.820
lf you see anything you like,
just let me know.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.867
What is this material?

07:14.967 --> 07:16.491
lt's so delicate.

07:16.569 --> 07:17.866
Exquisite, isn't it?

07:17.937 --> 07:20.462
lt's the latest import
from Dedestris.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.008
lt's spun
from the petals of a flower

07:23.075 --> 07:25.009
that blooms only in moonlight.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.341
Shall l have
a dress made for you?

07:27.413 --> 07:29.904
lt's lovely,
but, no... thank you.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.713
ls it so hard
for you to accept a gift?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.277
All right, but something small.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.515
Maybe a scarf?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.150
What a curious people you are.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.751
Tell me,
would it help if l said

07:42.829 --> 07:45.059
that you could have
an entire wardrobe

07:45.131 --> 07:46.894
made from these
beautiful fabrics,

07:46.966 --> 07:49.901
and that it would give
all of us pleasure

07:49.969 --> 07:51.903
to create it for you?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.405
Let's...
start with the scarf.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.941
As you like.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.839
Which cloth do you prefer, huh?

08:05.918 --> 08:08.216
That's beautiful.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.448
Are you a musician?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.957
This isn't a musical instrument.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.016
lt's an atmospheric sensor.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.085
The frequency of the chimes

08:17.163 --> 08:20.621
indicates changes
in weather conditions.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.602
Then it must work on a principle
of non-linear resonance,

08:24.670 --> 08:27.366
adjusting to the dynamic
variables in the atmosphere.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.738
That's exactly right.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.640
Are you a scientist?

08:31.711 --> 08:33.337
ln a sense.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.505
Can you show me
how to operate it?

08:35.581 --> 08:37.241
l'd be happy to.

08:37.316 --> 08:41.912
First, you have to initialize
the sub-harmonic mode.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.451
Mm-hmm.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.894
Oh, l think this one.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.659
When l see you
wearing that scarf,

08:53.733 --> 08:56.566
my pleasure will be
greater than yours.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.035
Well, l should get back.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.368
But with your permission,

09:01.440 --> 09:04.739
l'd like to start
organizing teams

09:04.810 --> 09:05.834
to gather plants and seeds.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.072
This is my associate,
Jaret Otel.

09:08.147 --> 09:11.583
You may contact him to make
any necessary arrangements.

09:11.651 --> 09:15.314
We'll be glad to assist you
in any way, Captain.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.687
l'll find my officers,
and we'll return to the ship.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.556
Tonight, we are having
a celebration here.

09:21.627 --> 09:25.063
l hope you and your officers
will be my guests.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.058
We'd be delighted.

09:36.442 --> 09:39.240
Captain's Log, Stardate 48642.5.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.906
The crew is enjoying an evening
on Sikaris.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.916
They are discovering,
to their delight, that reports

09:44.984 --> 09:48.442
of this species' hospitality
have not been exaggerated.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.751
...so the whole thing exploded,

09:50.823 --> 09:54.259
and there we were,
70,000 light years from home,

09:54.327 --> 09:56.625
and no way to get back.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.197
Felt pretty lonely.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.461
That's a very noble story.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.934
Noble?

10:04.070 --> 10:06.334
Mm-hmm.
Stories can be whimsical

10:06.405 --> 10:10.671
or frightening or-or melancholy
or many other things,

10:10.743 --> 10:16.010
but noble stories are the ones
that can most affect our lives.

10:17.516 --> 10:22.613
May l have your permission
to tell others this story?

10:22.688 --> 10:23.985
Sure.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.421
lt's no secret.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.982
But stories are
an essential part

10:28.060 --> 10:29.925
of every person's being.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.590
l would never share one
without permission.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.496
Go right ahead.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.797
l've got a few others, too.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.531
You do?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.232
Come with me.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.371
l know a private place

10:46.445 --> 10:50.245
where you can tell me
all your stories.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.250
Stand close to me.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.819
Alastria.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.725
Mm...

11:02.795 --> 11:04.387
Where are we?

11:04.463 --> 11:06.522
The woods of Alastria--

11:06.599 --> 11:08.590
my favorite place.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.126
l usually come here
when l want to spend time alone,

11:12.204 --> 11:13.398
but tonight, it...

11:13.472 --> 11:16.305
it seemed right to bring you.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.536
Now...

11:18.611 --> 11:21.375
tell me your stories--

11:21.447 --> 11:23.005
all of them.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.745
Why is it so much warmer here?

11:29.221 --> 11:31.519
What is that?

11:31.590 --> 11:34.525
The dawn zephyr.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.221
Dawn? We just got here.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.928
That's... that is
an amazing feeling.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.837
What... what's happening?

11:48.908 --> 11:51.206
The erosene winds--

11:53.145 --> 11:56.410
passion winds...

11:56.482 --> 12:00.782
come just before the dawn.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.822
The erosene creates euphoria.

12:06.992 --> 12:09.358
l'll say.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.576
Why am l seeing two suns?

12:28.647 --> 12:32.378
Because this is a binary system.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.147
But your planet
only has one sun.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.054
But Alastria has two.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.524
Eudana...

12:40.593 --> 12:42.322
Hmm?

12:42.394 --> 12:43.884
Where are we?

12:43.963 --> 12:45.988
l told you...

12:46.065 --> 12:48.158
Alastria--

12:48.234 --> 12:50.828
a system far from Sikaris.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.427
How far?

12:52.505 --> 12:55.303
Do you have to ask
all these questions?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.843
Please, it's important.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.371
Alastria is about
two and a half billion times

13:03.449 --> 13:06.543
the distance
between Sikaris and its sun.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.019
That's almost...

13:09.088 --> 13:11.113
40,000 light-years.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.182
Mmm...

13:14.260 --> 13:15.420
Now...

13:17.563 --> 13:19.554
...feel the breeze.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.234
Um, we have to go back.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.329
lt's still night on Sikaris.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.101
We have plenty of time.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.145
No. Um...

13:33.212 --> 13:35.203
we're going back--

13:35.281 --> 13:38.307
and l need you
to tell me everything you know

13:38.384 --> 13:40.909
about that platform
that got us here.

13:40.986 --> 13:46.856
And tomorrow night, you must
let me take you to the theater.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.120
Oh, my.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.219
l have lost all track of time.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.490
My crew has gone.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.191
l'm the last one here.

13:53.265 --> 13:57.861
l hope that's because
you are enjoying yourself.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.234
l am.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.674
Captain!

14:04.743 --> 14:06.404
Excuse me for interrupting,

14:06.478 --> 14:08.309
but l've just found out
about something incredible.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.312
Calm down, Ensign.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.609
What is it?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.083
That platform--

14:13.152 --> 14:14.915
it's a transportation device.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.750
Extremely sophisticated.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.915
lt operates on the principle
of folding space.

14:18.991 --> 14:22.620
That's something
that's been theorized,

14:22.695 --> 14:26.290
but no one's ever been able
to develop the technology.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.128
Well, these people have.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.636
l've just been
to Alastria and back.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.105
Alastria is 40,000
light years away.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.803
We call it a spatial trajector.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.311
We're able to travel

14:40.379 --> 14:41.971
to all the planets
in this Quadrant.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.174
How far can it take you?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.980
Alastria is at the outermost
limits of its range.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.178
Apparently, it's

14:48.254 --> 14:50.688
never been used to move anything
as large as Voyager,

14:50.756 --> 14:54.089
but as l understand
the principle of space folding,

14:54.159 --> 14:56.719
the size of the object
isn't relevant.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.594
What do you think?

14:59.665 --> 15:02.828
Would it be possible
to modify your technology

15:02.935 --> 15:05.460
so we could use it?

15:05.504 --> 15:07.199
l tried to tell him.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.036
What is it?

15:09.108 --> 15:11.008
We cannot share our technology.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.509
Once it's out of our control,

15:12.578 --> 15:15.809
it might fall into the hands
of those who would abuse it,

15:15.881 --> 15:19.339
and our Canon of Laws
strictly forbids that.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.010
But we wouldn't abuse it.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.783
Don't you see
what it would mean to us?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.587
Please, don't make it
more difficult for me.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.594
l don't enjoy denying you this,

15:29.662 --> 15:32.028
but our Canon of Laws
has determined

15:32.097 --> 15:33.826
our entire system of values.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.231
To break one of its precepts

15:36.302 --> 15:39.465
would undermine
everything we believe in.

15:39.538 --> 15:44.271
l'm sorry, but there can be
no exceptions to the law.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.761
l can't believe
they're not going to help us.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.556
Some kind of hospitality.

16:04.596 --> 16:05.722
40,000 light years.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.062
Even if that's
as far as we could go,

16:08.133 --> 16:11.193
it would still knock
about four decades off our trip.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.498
And the possibility exists

16:12.571 --> 16:14.471
that we could reconfigure
the matrix at that point,

16:14.540 --> 16:16.405
to take us another
30,000 light-years,

16:16.475 --> 16:18.773
right into Federation space.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.311
Since they've already said no,

16:20.379 --> 16:22.244
this kind of thinking
is only going

16:22.314 --> 16:23.906
to make you feel worse.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.714
lt's the first time
we've been on the other side

16:27.786 --> 16:29.276
of the fence.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.652
What fence?

16:30.723 --> 16:33.453
The one that's made
of binding principles.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.493
We have our own set of rules

16:35.561 --> 16:38.587
which includes
the Prime Directive.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.598
How many times
have we been in the position

16:40.666 --> 16:43.601
of refusing to interfere
when some kind of disaster

16:43.669 --> 16:45.796
threatened an alien culture?

16:45.871 --> 16:48.101
lt's all very well
to say we do it

16:48.173 --> 16:50.698
on the basis
of an enlightened principle,

16:50.776 --> 16:53.244
but how does that feel
to the aliens?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.311
l'm sure many of them think

16:57.383 --> 16:59.817
the Prime Directive
is a lousy idea.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.079
Even we think so sometimes.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.211
l know of many times
when Starfleet personnel

17:03.255 --> 17:06.053
have decided on strong
ethical grounds to ignore it.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.387
Still, there's a reason

17:07.459 --> 17:09.689
why it's Starfleet's
General Order #1.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.525
On the whole, it does
a lot more good than harm.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.996
Captain, it occurs to me

17:13.065 --> 17:15.032
that we know little
about the Sikarians.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.192
We cannot assume

17:16.268 --> 17:18.531
that their first refusal
is unalterable.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.573
lt may be that ''no'' is simply
a prelude to negotiation.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.904
He's right.
Maybe they can be reasoned with.

17:23.976 --> 17:24.907
Maybe they want something.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.239
Maybe they'll bargain.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.903
But what do we have to offer?

17:27.980 --> 17:30.278
They seem to have
everything they need.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.483
Stories.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.920
Stories are an important part
of their culture.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.322
They seem to provide
more than entertainment.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.520
They're kind of a measuring rod
of values and beliefs.

17:43.595 --> 17:46.086
We have a huge library
in our data banks.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.857
We could offer them
the whole thing.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.197
All the great literature
of dozens of cultures.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.566
What do you think, Captain?

17:51.637 --> 17:52.865
Would they be interested?

17:52.938 --> 17:55.372
They just might be.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.110
From what we've seen of them,

17:59.178 --> 18:02.375
they're a remarkably
pleasure-oriented people.

18:02.481 --> 18:06.383
They might appreciate
a gift of literature.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.749
l'll arrange to meet with Gath.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.516
As magistrate, he has the
authority to make this decision.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.851
ln the meantime,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.256
l'm going to take a look
at that trajector platform.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.850
Maybe l can figure out
how it works.

18:15.961 --> 18:17.895
You'll do nothing of the sort,
Lieutenant.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.366
lf l find
this law is negotiable,

18:22.434 --> 18:25.369
l'll make every attempt
to get the technology,

18:25.437 --> 18:28.270
but until then, we won't do
anything that might violate

18:28.340 --> 18:31.434
their Canon of Laws
as we understand it.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.307
That's all.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.113
What's wrong?

18:46.892 --> 18:49.554
l just hope she gets it.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.423
She will.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.343
Mmm. Exquisite.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.072
And what did you say
you call it?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.115
Pecan pie.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.649
l must have the recipe.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.947
l'd be happy
to share it with you.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.255
Gath... l want you to know
l understand your reluctance

19:21.326 --> 19:23.317
to share your technology
with us.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.862
We have similar restrictions.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.454
But l wondered,

19:27.533 --> 19:29.728
would it make any difference
if l gave you my word

19:29.801 --> 19:31.632
that we would destroy
the trajector matrix

19:31.703 --> 19:33.830
as soon as we'd used it?

19:33.906 --> 19:37.774
l know this will upset you,
but l can't.

19:37.843 --> 19:42.177
l understand, and frankly,
l suspected as much,

19:42.247 --> 19:46.411
but l have a proposal
which might allow you

19:46.485 --> 19:48.146
to obey your laws

19:48.220 --> 19:50.984
and still give us what we want.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.285
Surely you could use
the trajector to send us.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.560
40,000 light-years
would mean a great deal to us,

20:01.633 --> 20:05.729
and in return, we're prepared
to offer you something

20:05.804 --> 20:07.032
you might enjoy.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.436
Oh!

20:08.507 --> 20:09.974
A full library

20:10.042 --> 20:14.274
of the Federation's
finest literature.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.177
Literature?

20:18.584 --> 20:20.677
Centuries of stories.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.880
New stories
from diverse cultures.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.447
Stories that fire
the imagination.

20:28.260 --> 20:32.993
You certainly know
how to tempt me, Captain.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.533
lt's certainly possible.

20:35.601 --> 20:38.229
l'll have to meet with the other
magistrates to discuss it.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.999
No one has ever made
a request like that.

20:41.106 --> 20:45.873
ln the meantime, l'd like to
enjoy every bite of, uh, this...

20:45.944 --> 20:47.639
how did you call it?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.271
Pecan pie.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.956
l finished the maintenance check

21:01.059 --> 21:03.118
on the shock attenuation
cylinders.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.254
They'll have to be replaced
in another 2,000 hours,

21:05.330 --> 21:07.958
but we'll face that problem
when we come to it.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.268
Seska.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.930
Sorry. l wasn't concentrating.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.600
What did you say?

21:16.675 --> 21:19.610
You looked a million
light-years away.

21:19.678 --> 21:20.736
No.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.975
Only about 70,000.

21:24.082 --> 21:28.746
My brother's birthday
is in four days.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.312
Last year, l promised
l'd meet him on Nivoch

21:32.391 --> 21:34.586
to celebrate with him.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.026
He'll think l broke my promise.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.232
That l'm dead.

21:50.542 --> 21:51.509
What are you doing?

21:51.576 --> 21:52.600
l've been thinking.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.511
The folding of space
should leave a subspace residue.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.638
lf we can detect one,

21:56.715 --> 21:58.580
we might be a step closer
to knowing

21:58.650 --> 21:59.947
how the trajector works.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.111
Look at that
neutrino dispersion pattern.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.212
Could that be the result
of space folding?

22:05.257 --> 22:08.317
Maybe. lf the device
creates a neutrino bubble

22:08.393 --> 22:10.691
around whatever's
being trajected.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.195
lf that's the case,

22:12.264 --> 22:15.199
we'd need a bubble
big enough for the ship.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.031
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.537
l'm with you on this one.

22:20.605 --> 22:24.541
After all,
it doesn't hurt to theorize.

22:24.609 --> 22:29.478
Right, and hypothetically,

22:29.548 --> 22:31.948
if we could modify
the deflector array

22:32.017 --> 22:33.644
to emit phased neutrinos,

22:33.719 --> 22:36.483
we could create
a big enough bubble.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.852
Let's give it a try.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.948
ln theory, of course.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.665
l don't understand.

22:50.736 --> 22:52.499
Why is it so important
l come here now?

22:52.571 --> 22:54.539
You'll see in a minute.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.741
We're here.

23:00.846 --> 23:01.904
Good evening, Ensign.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.915
Thank you for coming.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.244
What's this about?

23:05.317 --> 23:06.579
l asked Eudana
to invite you here

23:06.651 --> 23:09.211
because l was sure
you would respond to her

23:09.287 --> 23:11.915
and because it would
look perfectly natural.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.857
l am prepared to accept
your collection of literature

23:14.926 --> 23:17.087
in exchange
for our trajector technology.

23:17.162 --> 23:20.222
ls that something
you're authorized to do?

23:20.298 --> 23:23.426
Officially, no,
but many people believe

23:23.502 --> 23:25.527
that rules
should be flexible enough

23:25.604 --> 23:28.368
to meet the needs of the moment.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.068
There is a great desire here
for new stories,

23:31.143 --> 23:33.634
and l want to be the one
to supply them.

23:33.712 --> 23:37.478
So you'd stand to benefit
from this arrangement, right?

23:37.549 --> 23:39.244
We would both benefit.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.944
l would gain prestige,

23:41.019 --> 23:43.920
and you would gain
40,000 light-years

23:43.989 --> 23:48.153
in your journey home,
possibly more.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.318
This is it, Ensign--

23:49.394 --> 23:50.691
the matrix of the trajector.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.765
Captain Janeway
has asked the magistrate

23:56.835 --> 23:58.325
to send us 40,000 light-years.

23:58.403 --> 23:59.768
He won't.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.306
He never had any intention
of helping you leave here.

24:02.407 --> 24:04.272
Jaret is right.

24:04.309 --> 24:08.302
l know how much
it means to you to get home.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.507
Please, listen to him.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.607
You must believe me
when l tell you

24:12.684 --> 24:15.517
this is the only way
you will make that journey.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.880
Consider my offer.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.688
l'm sure you will decide
it is a fair one.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.924
l don't know what to do.

24:25.997 --> 24:29.262
l know we'd all like to get
that much closer to home,

24:29.334 --> 24:30.596
but l don't think
Captain Janeway

24:30.669 --> 24:32.762
is going to go for getting
the technology like that.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.430
Maybe she will.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.532
After all, it's a Sikarian
who's making the offer.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.133
But it's not aboveboard.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.406
The Captain
is only going to deal

24:41.480 --> 24:43.744
with an official representative.

24:43.815 --> 24:44.747
Bridge to Ensign Kim.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.215
The Captain can see you now.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.612
Just tell her
everything you know.

24:47.686 --> 24:48.812
Let her take it from there.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.718
Right.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.381
l'll walk you partway.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.322
l'm headed for bed.

24:55.694 --> 25:00.427
Somehow... l have
a bad feeling about this.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.864
lt's just not going to work out.

25:01.933 --> 25:05.198
Don't you think that's up to us?

25:05.270 --> 25:06.862
What does that mean?

25:06.938 --> 25:08.599
lt means that we can sit here

25:08.673 --> 25:10.265
and let someone make
the decision for us,

25:10.342 --> 25:11.866
or we can take matters
into our own hands.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.877
We've been offered
the grand prize.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.244
All we have to do is
step up and claim it.

25:17.315 --> 25:19.681
Take the technology?

25:19.751 --> 25:21.309
Without permission?

25:21.386 --> 25:23.616
Since when
do you talk like that?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.588
Do you think permission
is more important

25:25.657 --> 25:28.421
than getting us halfway home?

25:28.493 --> 25:32.054
The Captain is so infatuated
with the Sikarian magistrate,

25:32.130 --> 25:33.529
she can't think straight.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.088
We can't trust
that she's going to make

25:35.166 --> 25:38.602
the best decision for all of us.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.104
lf we do this,
we'll need to use Engineering

25:41.172 --> 25:43.504
to configure the matrix.

25:43.575 --> 25:46.544
lt will be a lot easier if we
knew we could count on you.

25:46.611 --> 25:49.478
Seska, l am
a senior officer now.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.413
l have responsibilities.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.383
And the main responsibility
for everyone on this ship

25:53.451 --> 25:54.475
is to try to find a way home.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.579
Captain Janeway made that clear
from the beginning.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.682
That's our primary mission.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.057
Just think about it.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.392
That's all.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.811
Did Jaret explain what he meant
when he said

26:20.879 --> 26:22.744
Gath had no intention
of helping us leave?

26:22.814 --> 26:23.906
No.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.246
He just made it clear
that our only choice

26:26.318 --> 26:28.252
was to get the trajector
technology from him.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.585
He may simply want us to believe
that so we would deal with him.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.922
Possibly...

26:34.993 --> 26:38.929
but somehow,
l suspect he's right.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.760
Thank you for coming to me
with this, Ensign.

26:40.832 --> 26:42.925
lt may muddy
the situation somewhat,

26:43.001 --> 26:44.798
but it helps me force the issue.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.063
Dismissed.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.695
Good night, Captain.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.069
Lieutenant.

26:55.113 --> 26:58.139
Oh, Tuvok, what do l do now?

26:58.216 --> 27:00.741
You would seem
to have two options--

27:00.819 --> 27:04.846
continue to negotiate with a man
who may have a hidden agenda,

27:04.923 --> 27:09.189
or deal with a man who is
willing to defy his own laws.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.194
Not very pretty choices.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.594
At least if you deal with Jaret,

27:13.665 --> 27:15.530
it is his law
that is being compromised,

27:15.600 --> 27:19.036
not ours.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.538
But does that matter?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.870
l told the crew
when we started this journey

27:23.942 --> 27:26.035
that we'd be a Starfleet crew,

27:26.111 --> 27:28.773
behaving as Starfleet
would expect us to.

27:28.847 --> 27:32.510
That means there's a certain
standard l have to uphold.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.580
Principles, principles.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.590
That's what it comes down to.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.685
Do l compromise
my almighty principles?

27:43.762 --> 27:46.287
But how do l not compromise them

27:46.364 --> 27:48.730
if it involves a chance
to get the crew

27:48.800 --> 27:51.530
more than halfway home?

27:51.603 --> 27:53.867
How do l tell them...

27:53.938 --> 27:56.873
my principles are so important

27:56.941 --> 27:59.466
l would deny them
that opportunity?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.672
l believe
the first thing you must do

28:03.748 --> 28:05.045
is determine whether or not

28:05.116 --> 28:08.176
Gath is willing to use
the trajector to help us.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.187
lf that possibility
exists at all,

28:10.255 --> 28:11.847
you must explore it.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.550
You're right.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.757
Thank you, Tuvok.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.531
Have you spoken
with the other magistrates

28:26.604 --> 28:28.868
about using the trajector?

28:28.940 --> 28:30.532
Actually, l haven't.

28:30.608 --> 28:31.404
Some of them are traveling now,

28:31.476 --> 28:34.741
but l assure you l will do it.

28:34.813 --> 28:38.214
Oh, l've already seen all those.

28:38.283 --> 28:40.911
lt's becoming a matter
of some urgency.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.247
Oh. Why?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.584
We've imposed on you
for long enough.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.180
Not true.

28:46.257 --> 28:49.283
We welcome you
for as long as you can stay,

28:49.360 --> 28:52.454
and l hope that's
a very long time indeed.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.759
My crew is eager
to continue our journey.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.360
Once they realized

28:59.437 --> 29:01.530
the trajector might bring
us 40,000 light-years

29:01.639 --> 29:03.106
closer to home...

29:03.141 --> 29:06.542
Why are you so consumed
with this desire to get home?

29:06.611 --> 29:09.045
l find it difficult
to understand.

29:09.114 --> 29:12.015
Home... is home.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.210
lt's where we belong.

29:14.285 --> 29:17.448
Couldn't you create
a new home here with us?

29:17.522 --> 29:19.990
Can you imagine
a more delightful place to live

29:20.058 --> 29:22.686
where you could pass your time
extracting pleasure

29:22.761 --> 29:24.285
from every moment?

29:24.362 --> 29:25.852
l promise you,

29:25.930 --> 29:30.526
you and l have many
such moments to explore.

29:30.602 --> 29:35.369
Yes, but for how long?

29:35.440 --> 29:38.534
l've seen how quickly
you get tired of your pleasures.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.910
All that interests you
is what's new and unexplored.

29:42.981 --> 29:46.075
After a day or two,
it becomes commonplace.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.743
Yes...

29:47.819 --> 29:50.117
We prefer permanence...

29:50.188 --> 29:53.089
the reward
of relationships that endure

29:53.158 --> 29:55.922
and grow deeper
with the passing of time.

29:55.994 --> 29:59.725
You would lose those notions
if you stayed with us.

29:59.798 --> 30:04.394
You may be right,
and that's why we have to leave.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.099
We have offered you
nothing but hospitality.

30:09.174 --> 30:14.305
ls this how you repay us,
with an attack on our beliefs?

30:14.379 --> 30:16.904
l'm sorry.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.644
l was just trying to illustrate
the differences between us.

30:20.718 --> 30:22.811
l don't enjoy
being judged like this.

30:22.887 --> 30:25.447
lt's very upsetting,
not at all pleasurable.

30:26.491 --> 30:30.325
That's all you really
care about, isn't it?

30:30.395 --> 30:32.158
Your pleasure.

30:32.230 --> 30:36.291
All your hospitality,
your graciousness--

30:36.367 --> 30:39.495
it was never
about giving us pleasure.

30:39.571 --> 30:43.007
lt's all been
to gratify yourselves.

30:43.107 --> 30:45.871
We're nothing more
than the latest novelty.

30:45.944 --> 30:49.209
You're hostile and vicious.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.714
You would infect
the joyousness of our lives.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.751
You must leave immediately.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.253
You never had any intention
of helping us, did you?

30:58.323 --> 30:59.585
Of course l did.

30:59.657 --> 31:02.251
l did everything in my power
to persuade you to stay here.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.589
Janeway to Voyager.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.460
One to beam up.

31:18.343 --> 31:21.210
Cancel all shore leave
and recall the away teams.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.144
We've been asked to leave.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.647
Aye, Captain.

31:26.351 --> 31:29.650
l assume that means
Gath will not be assisting us.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.485
l don't think he ever had
any intention of helping us.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.651
He just... strung us along.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.161
Are you considering
Jaret's offer?

31:38.229 --> 31:40.663
Oh, l wish l could...

31:40.732 --> 31:42.666
but l can't.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.134
Captain, it'll take hours
to get everyone up.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.295
We've got crew members

31:46.371 --> 31:47.998
scattered throughout
both hemispheres.

31:48.139 --> 31:50.334
Get them back as quickly
as you can, Commander.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.501
l think we've overextended
our stay here.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.512
l'll be in my ready room.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.246
l've downloaded
the Federation library.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.255
lt all on these chips.

32:05.323 --> 32:06.585
We know the man to contact.

32:06.658 --> 32:07.920
He wants the library,

32:07.992 --> 32:09.926
and he doesn't care
who gives it to him.

32:09.994 --> 32:10.926
We're under orders...

32:10.995 --> 32:12.758
B'Elanna, right now,

32:12.830 --> 32:14.923
our people are still
fighting Cardassians,

32:14.999 --> 32:16.933
dying for our cause.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.162
Settlers
in the Demilitarized Zone

32:19.237 --> 32:20.898
are still under attack.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.906
We made a promise, B'Elanna,

32:22.974 --> 32:26.171
that we'd all stick together
until the Zone was safe,

32:26.244 --> 32:29.213
and l intend
to keep that promise.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.477
l have a wife
and two little boys.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.643
l don't want them to grow up
without a father.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.983
l'd do anything to prevent that.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.079
We're not the only ones.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.455
Everyone wants to get back.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.188
They're just waiting
for someone to act.

32:44.262 --> 32:46.787
l've been working on the theory
that the trajector

32:46.864 --> 32:48.991
operates
within a neutrino envelope.

32:49.100 --> 32:49.998
lf that's true,

32:50.101 --> 32:53.628
l think we can use it
as many times as we need

32:53.705 --> 32:56.265
until we're all the way home.

32:56.341 --> 33:00.505
Just think-- by tomorrow,
we could be there.

33:05.616 --> 33:08.915
All right.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.579
Let's do it.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.690
With shore leave canceled,

33:18.763 --> 33:20.924
are we able to get
to the surface undetected?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.092
We'll have to override
the security lockout,

33:23.167 --> 33:24.259
but that shouldn't
be a problem.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.428
lt's not accepting
my security code.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.096
Reinitialize
the lockout buffers.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.036
l did.
lt's not working.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.768
Someone's altered
the security subroutine.

33:30.842 --> 33:31.934
Why would anyone do that?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.773
Never mind.
Beam me down.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.312
Are you crazy?!

33:35.380 --> 33:38.178
Security will find you out
before you get there.

33:46.457 --> 33:49.483
l altered
the security subroutines.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.994
Any attempt to override
the lockout

33:52.063 --> 33:54.156
would have alerted me
to your presence here.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.569
ls this Voyager's library

34:02.640 --> 34:05.837
which you intended to trade
for the trajector technology?

34:07.111 --> 34:08.668
Yes.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.250
When l attempted to download it,

34:13.317 --> 34:15.181
l noticed it had
already been accessed.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.619
You were going to download it?

34:17.688 --> 34:20.282
l will make the exchange
with Jaret Otel.

34:25.295 --> 34:26.922
Return to your stations.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.123
Do what you can

34:28.199 --> 34:30.167
to prepare the ship
for the matrix.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.259
Energize.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.978
Mr. Tuvok is
on the surface now, Captain.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.485
He says the remaining away teams

34:50.554 --> 34:51.954
should be on board
within 15 minutes.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.888
Are all the food supplies
secured?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.152
Aye, Captain.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.659
As soon as the last
of the crew gets back,

34:56.726 --> 34:58.160
we'll be ready to leave.

34:58.229 --> 34:59.321
Bridge to Engineering.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.489
Torres here.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.395
We'll be leaving orbit
within minutes.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.264
Ready all propulsion systems.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.927
We're ready now, Captain.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.866
Where's Tuvok?

35:09.006 --> 35:10.030
He'll be here.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.541
We certainly won't leave
without him.

35:11.609 --> 35:11.870
Well, what's keeping him?

35:12.009 --> 35:13.909
Calm down.

35:13.978 --> 35:17.106
You're going to draw
attention to yourself.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.550
Do not attempt
to activate the device

35:24.622 --> 35:26.453
until l've spoken
to Captain Janeway.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.463
What are you doing?

35:33.531 --> 35:35.522
He said not to activate it.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.794
l'm not.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.894
l'm just going to try
the interface simulation.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.439
We don't even know
if it will interface.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.943
We can give ourselves
a head start by testing it now.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.102
All right.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.841
But just a simulation.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.415
lt's working.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.049
l was right.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.220
lt operates
within a neutrino envelope.

36:04.295 --> 36:05.853
The trajector field
is bigger than anything

36:05.963 --> 36:08.124
we've created
by ten orders of magnitude.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.030
To get a field that size,

36:10.101 --> 36:12.569
you'd need an amplifier
as big as a planet.

36:12.637 --> 36:13.865
l don't understand.

36:13.938 --> 36:16.304
How do they get
that kind of amplification?

36:16.374 --> 36:19.002
l'll show you.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.543
Sikaris has a mantle

36:20.611 --> 36:23.910
of tetrahedral quartz
20 kilometers thick.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.778
The crystalline structure
of the mantle serves

36:25.850 --> 36:28.284
to focus and amplify
the trajector field.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.616
lf that's
how the power transfer occurs,

36:30.688 --> 36:34.089
then once we leave orbit,
we lose the ability to traject.

36:34.158 --> 36:36.718
We don't have time to test it.

36:36.794 --> 36:40.252
We'll have to try it now
or forget it.

36:40.331 --> 36:41.593
-Do it.
-lf there are

36:41.666 --> 36:43.657
-any compatibility problems...
-Then we can abort.

36:43.734 --> 36:45.599
This is our only chance.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.935
Bridge to Engineering.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.200
Torres here.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.263
We're ready to leave orbit.

36:51.342 --> 36:52.809
Thrusters on line.

36:52.877 --> 36:53.935
Aye, Captain.

36:54.078 --> 36:56.205
We have to do something.

36:57.815 --> 37:00.045
Mr. Paris, take us out of orbit.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.413
4,000 kph.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.010
Aye, Captain.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.353
There's no response.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.948
Thrusters are off line.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.549
Janeway to Engineering.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.185
What's going on, Lieutenant?

37:11.262 --> 37:14.197
We've got a phase variance
in plasma conduit 3.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.598
l'll have to check it out
before we can engage thrusters.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.397
When did this problem show up?

37:19.470 --> 37:20.869
Just now, Captain.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.771
lt's only a slight variance.
l'll have it fixed in a minute.

37:23.841 --> 37:25.468
Keep me advised.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.069
All right.

37:29.146 --> 37:31.614
The matrix is activating.

37:31.682 --> 37:33.809
The trajector field is forming.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.476
And it's amplifying.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.817
Look how fast it's expanding.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.378
That's the effect
of the quartz mantle.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.322
We're nearly
at full field strength.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.324
This is going to work.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.719
What is it?

37:47.465 --> 37:49.797
The plasma manifold
is becoming unstable.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.696
l can compensate for that.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.862
The manifold is being bombarded

37:53.938 --> 37:56.270
by anti-neutrinos
from the trajector field.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.773
Anti-neutrinos?

37:57.842 --> 38:00.504
The must be the catalyst
for the space folding process.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.509
lt's not working.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.536
l can't compensate
for the instability.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.913
There's no way to compensate
for a field that size.

38:11.055 --> 38:13.319
Captain, l'm showing
an unstable plasma manifold.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.858
We're headed for a breach.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.859
Bridge to Torres.
What's happening?

38:16.927 --> 38:20.260
We're reading
a warp core breach up here.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.958
We're on it, Captain.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.330
No time to talk.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.959
Shut down the matrix!

38:25.036 --> 38:26.970
l can't!
lt's not responding!

38:27.038 --> 38:28.300
lt's fused!

38:28.372 --> 38:30.772
Plasma temperature
at 43 million Kelvin!

38:30.841 --> 38:32.433
Carey, get everybody out!

38:32.510 --> 38:34.603
All right, people, let's go!
Right now!

38:34.679 --> 38:36.203
Move it out!
Move out! Come on!

38:36.280 --> 38:37.372
Let's go! Right now!

38:37.448 --> 38:39.006
Let's go, come on!
Move it out! Fast!

38:39.083 --> 38:40.050
Right now!

38:40.117 --> 38:41.914
Keep moving!

38:41.986 --> 38:43.419
l can't unlock it.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.149
The command matrix is sealed.

38:46.223 --> 38:49.886
Plasma temperature
at 50 million Kelvin!

38:53.531 --> 38:56.056
Anti-neutrino
bombardment has stopped.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.067
Plasma temperature dropping.

39:06.610 --> 39:11.638
We didn't anticipate
anti-neutrinos.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.514
The trajector could
never be compatible

39:14.585 --> 39:17.179
with Federation technology.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.518
l'll start erasing
the sensor logs.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.421
We can blame it
on the phase discrepancy.

39:21.492 --> 39:22.789
No.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.328
We're not going
to cover this up.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.363
Are you crazy?

39:26.430 --> 39:28.694
We don't have to take the blame
for this.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.563
But we're going to.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.872
We disobeyed orders,
gambling it would pay off.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.703
lt didn't.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.403
And now we just can't pretend
like nothing happened.

39:40.478 --> 39:41.911
l don't understand.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.913
There's no need for this.

39:43.981 --> 39:46.575
l'm sorry
if you don't get it, Seska,

39:46.650 --> 39:49.915
but it has something
to do with, um...

39:49.987 --> 39:52.285
with being able
to live with yourself.

39:52.356 --> 39:55.757
That doesn't sound like you.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.157
You've changed.

39:59.163 --> 40:01.563
lf that's true...

40:01.632 --> 40:03.930
l take it as a compliment.

40:10.608 --> 40:13.099
l take full responsibility
for what happened.

40:13.177 --> 40:16.078
There were others involved,
but l was the senior officer,

40:16.147 --> 40:19.082
and the culpability is mine.

40:19.150 --> 40:22.483
Lieutenant Torres is not
precisely correct, Captain.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.249
She was not
the senior officer involved.

40:25.322 --> 40:26.584
l was.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.460
You?

40:30.528 --> 40:33.122
lt was l who made the exchange--

40:33.197 --> 40:36.325
the Federation library
for the trajector matrix.

40:48.412 --> 40:50.972
l will deal with you
in a moment.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.615
l don't have the luxury
of throwing you in the brig

40:56.687 --> 40:58.552
for the rest of this voyage.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.646
l need you.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.658
l need every person
on this ship.

41:04.662 --> 41:06.653
But l want you to know

41:06.730 --> 41:10.461
how very deeply
you have disappointed me.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.736
lf there are
any further transgressions,

41:16.807 --> 41:19.776
even a minor one...

41:19.844 --> 41:24.804
you will no longer be
an officer on this crew.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.115
ls that clear?

41:28.185 --> 41:30.551
Yes, ma'am.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.519
Dismissed.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.924
l don't even know
where to start.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.365
l want you to explain to me

41:49.440 --> 41:53.399
how you, of all people,
could be involved in this.

41:53.477 --> 41:55.638
lt is quite simple, Captain.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.045
You have made it clear
on many occasions

41:58.115 --> 42:00.310
that your highest goal
for the crew

42:00.417 --> 42:01.782
is to get them home.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.116
But in this instance,

42:03.187 --> 42:05.417
your standards
would not allow you

42:05.489 --> 42:06.888
to violate Sikarian law.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.721
Someone had to spare you
the ethical dilemma.

42:09.793 --> 42:12.626
l was the logical choice,

42:12.696 --> 42:15.324
and so l chose to act.

42:19.036 --> 42:22.233
You did it for me...

42:22.306 --> 42:24.774
because you knew l couldn't.

42:25.843 --> 42:28.937
l accept the consequences
of my actions.

42:29.013 --> 42:30.981
l expect to lose my commission

42:31.048 --> 42:32.208
and to be court-martialed

42:32.283 --> 42:35.343
when we return
to Federation space.

42:47.164 --> 42:51.567
You are one
of my most valued officers...

42:51.635 --> 42:54.661
and you are my friend.

42:54.738 --> 42:58.401
lt is vital
that you understand me here.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.939
l need you.

43:03.948 --> 43:07.679
But l also need to know
that l can count on you.

43:07.751 --> 43:10.584
You are my counsel--

43:10.654 --> 43:14.283
the one l turn to when l need
my moral compass checked.

43:14.358 --> 43:17.691
We have forged
this relationship for years,

43:17.761 --> 43:19.854
and l depend on it.

43:30.474 --> 43:32.704
l realize you made
a sacrifice for me...

43:32.776 --> 43:35.506
but it's not one

43:35.579 --> 43:39.071
l would have allowed you
to make.

43:39.149 --> 43:43.984
You can use logic
to justify almost anything.

43:44.054 --> 43:46.818
That's its power...

43:46.890 --> 43:48.323
and its flaw.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.860
From now on...

43:51.929 --> 43:55.490
bring your logic to me.

43:55.566 --> 43:58.501
Don't act on it behind my back.

44:00.537 --> 44:03.563
You have my word.

44:03.641 --> 44:07.202
My logic was not in error...

44:07.277 --> 44:09.245
but l was.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.076
Dismissed.
