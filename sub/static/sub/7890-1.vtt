<i>(Bill)
The scene is Athens,
400 B. C.</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:27.111
<i>A bunch
of the local brainiacs
have gotten together.</i>

00:27.195 --> 00:30.948
<i>The wine is being passed
and the ideas are flowing
fast and furious.</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:34.285
<i>The debate's in full force.
And Socrates has the floor.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:38.623
Who enters?
Alcibiades. Drunk.

00:38.706 --> 00:43.252
A beautiful man.
Hopelessly in love
with his mentor, Socrates.

00:43.336 --> 00:46.797
And uniquely,
in all of these dialogs,

00:46.881 --> 00:51.302
Socrates doesn't
get the last word.
Alcibiades does. Why?

00:51.385 --> 00:54.597
<i>(Bill)
Because passion,
Plato seems to be saying,</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:58.559
<i>is essentially
and mercilessly human.</i>

00:58.643 --> 01:01.395
And the best
that we can hope
to do is to quell it

01:01.479 --> 01:03.648
through relentless discipline.

01:03.773 --> 01:08.194
<i>To Socrates,
the healthy life is
comprised of constant focus</i>

01:08.277 --> 01:11.822
<i>by the individual
to excise those forces</i>

01:11.906 --> 01:17.662
that weaken or
confuse his understanding
of the world around him.

01:17.745 --> 01:23.501
He implores us
to devote our lives
to this kind of control.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.462
Meaning , our every
waking moment.

01:26.587 --> 01:32.927
<i>Socrates recognized
what every philosopher
and religion, for that matter</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:37.223
in the history of the world ,
from Plato to Aristotle

01:37.306 --> 01:39.934
from Epicurus to the Stoics

01:40.017 --> 01:42.436
from the Judeo-Christians
to the Buddhists

01:42.520 --> 01:45.398
have all observed

01:45.481 --> 01:53.281
which is that
the balance needed
for a happy life is illusory.

01:53.364 --> 01:57.702
And as soon as
in our gorgeously
flawed human way

01:57.785 --> 02:00.830
we think
that we've attained it

02:00.913 --> 02:05.209
we're pretending divinity
and we're gonna crash.

02:05.293 --> 02:09.005
Like Icarus,
flaming into the sea.

02:09.130 --> 02:13.175
So think about that
this weekend when you think
you're on top of the world

02:13.259 --> 02:16.345
and then you pour
a pitcher of beer
down your throat

02:16.429 --> 02:19.223
and chase
that upper classmen
who's out of your league.

02:22.101 --> 02:26.105
Aristotle is next week.
Don't just look
at it as words.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.734
Imagine the scene.
These were people. They
were alive like you and me.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.819
They thought things.
Breath them into life.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.696
[bells toll]

02:33.779 --> 02:37.033
<i>(Anne)
So, I was thinking
about doing this contrast</i>

02:37.116 --> 02:39.285
<i>between dialog
and chorus in Sophocles.</i>

02:39.368 --> 02:41.746
You should
read Nietzsche's
<i>Birth of Tragedy.</i>

02:41.829 --> 02:43.998
<i>He says that tragedy
emerges from the clash</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:47.543
<i>between Apollo God
of reason and harmony</i>

02:47.626 --> 02:50.463
and Dionysus,
God of intoxication.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.424
And that their struggle
within our human condition

02:53.507 --> 02:55.885
is inevitable
and that that
is what has produced

02:55.968 --> 02:58.596
<i>the most
salient form of art
the world's ever known.</i>

02:58.679 --> 02:59.722
Tragedy?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.098
What, you don't think so?

03:01.182 --> 03:04.310
I like comedies.
You wanna see a movie?

03:04.393 --> 03:07.438
No, Miss Greenstein.
I'm sorry.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.606
Did you get my note?

03:08.689 --> 03:09.732
<i>I did.</i>

03:09.815 --> 03:11.150
And?

03:11.233 --> 03:13.277
It was very clever
to write it in Latin.

03:13.361 --> 03:16.030
<i>With the repeated use
of the passive periphrastic?</i>

03:16.113 --> 03:17.948
That's quite profligate.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.993
And how I was
sending Cicero
with alliterative adjectives

03:21.077 --> 03:22.995
thrusting themselves
into the verbs?

03:23.079 --> 03:24.413
None of this
was lost on me.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.748
So?

03:25.831 --> 03:29.543
Miss Greenstein.
You are very, very bright

03:29.627 --> 03:32.254
and very fetching
in your way.

03:32.338 --> 03:37.301
<i>But there
are certain rules
mores if you will,</i>

03:37.385 --> 03:39.220
lines that we don't cross.

03:41.847 --> 03:46.727
I'm not joking , actually
and I'm gonna ask you
in the future to refrain--

03:46.811 --> 03:48.396
No. No!
Please don't do that.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.232
I'm going to ask you
to open that door,
Miss Greenstein.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.985
(in Latin)
Lingua sed torpet,
tenuis sub artis.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.948

04:01.534 --> 04:04.870
<i>However--
Oh, no-no-no!
Absolutely not.</i>

04:08.958 --> 04:12.503
This is, don't,
this is not good
for either of us. No!

04:12.586 --> 04:14.171
<i>Oh!</i>

04:14.255 --> 04:16.841
Excuse me!
Uh , I'll, I'll--

04:16.923 --> 04:18.676
Uh , Maggie.
Maggie!

04:18.759 --> 04:21.387
Please don't go.
Miss Greenstein
was just leaving.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.195
<i>Maggie.</i>

04:38.279 --> 04:39.905
Absolutely nothing.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.574
You don't
have to say anything.

04:41.657 --> 04:45.911
I would never.
She, she, she
went and just wah.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.330
They're all
in love with you.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.166
Just like Harvard.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.209
Who told you that?

04:52.334 --> 04:56.213
<i>This is the Classics
Department. No one is more
gossipy than you people.</i>

04:56.297 --> 05:00.050
Okay. I am going
to Cambridge in the morning.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.886
It's just a lunch.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.513
I liked popping 'em

me get my homework done.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.765

A little bit more

13:55.752 --> 13:59.506
Your book
on Marcus Aurelius has
the community astir.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.299
Oh , thanks.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.551
Which press was that?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.386
Oxford.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.305
<i>(Levy)
They did
your translation
of The Menaechmi.</i>

14:07.389 --> 14:09.933
<i>(Bill)
They did.
They've been terrific.</i>

14:10.017 --> 14:12.936

do you find the time?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.856
Well, uh , I don't
have a life.
[chuckles]

14:15.939 --> 14:18.275
[uncomfortable chuckles]

14:18.358 --> 14:21.987
I read some
biographical material
on you last week, Bill.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.323
You , uh , you come
from humble beginnings.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.784
I do. Yeah.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.286
Where was
it? Omaha?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.787
Oklahoma.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.540
Oh , why don't you ,
uh , why don't you
have an accent?

14:33.623 --> 14:36.960
With some considerable
effort, I lost it.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.337
And you , your father
was a bootlegger?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.548
It was my
grandfather, actually.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.716
Fantastic.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.760
Why fantastic?

14:44.843 --> 14:48.096
(Sorenson)
I don't know.
So many of us were
trained for this life.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.474
Fancy private schools,
parents in academia.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.477
I , I'm always astounded
by those who've made
their own way.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.981
Oh , thank you.
I , uh , my family
is a bit

14:58.065 --> 14:59.399
eccentric.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.026
I found
discipline in books.

15:01.109 --> 15:05.197
Well, you're probably
wondering why Dean
Sorenson is here.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.910
Bill, we'd like to offer you
a position in the law school.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.498
You can't be serious.

15:14.623 --> 15:18.376
<i>(Sorenson)
We wanted to incorporate
more philosophy into
the curriculum</i>

15:18.460 --> 15:21.254
And when we got wind
of your hesitancy

15:21.338 --> 15:23.507
<i>in transferring
up from Brown and Classics,</i>

15:23.632 --> 15:27.594
we had the idea of letting
you create your own institute
for our law students.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.682
[chuckles]
I , uh ,

15:32.766 --> 15:36.937
I don't even know
how to begin to respond.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.398
That is such
a precipitous offer.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.983
Savor it.

15:42.067 --> 15:47.030
Digest it.
Moments like this
come too seldom in life.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.366

<i>(Levy)

you to Tulsa?

Pardon? Oh , uh ,
a family matter.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.771
I was gonna say
because, nobody visits
Oklahoma, you know?

19:47.896 --> 19:52.359
It's one of the states
where you either live there,
or you got business there.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.195
But you don't
see people coming
for the attractions.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.446
Right.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.448
What do you do?

19:58.531 --> 20:04.245
I , uh ,
I write and teach.
I'm a professor.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.455
Of?

too much use for that
these days. Right?

that much , actually.

I'm starting out
all over.
You know.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.735
People don't realize it,
but it's, it's tough
to break in.

21:17.819 --> 21:22.365
You get most of your
business through your
kid's school, church ,

21:22.449 --> 21:25.118
The synagogue in my case,
you know. But it's tough.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.372
I mean , the cost
of a practice these
days is just, uh ,

21:29.456 --> 21:32.208
it's downright
humiliating. Honestly.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.461
It's downright humiliating.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.463
Yeah , I believe you.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.090
We were living in Manhattan.

So, you know,
we just moved back.

of Jews in Tulsa?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.808

But, but there are.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.087
I wondered
where you was at.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.131
<i>(Bolger)
Don't seem like
a fair fight.</i>

27:12.256 --> 27:15.218
<i>(Buddy)
Well, nobody asked
you two to come up
north neither.</i>

27:15.301 --> 27:16.594
We had business
in Tulsa.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.095
I heard about that.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.514
What you heard?

27:19.597 --> 27:22.016
Heard that Brady here
owes Pug a lot of money.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.893
Will you explain
this, please?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.813
The less you say
to these two fuckin'
inbreds the better.

27:26.896 --> 27:29.941
He thinks you'll
expand business down
to all of Little Dixie.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.400
Dumb pussy,
I already said.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.902
How 'bout I say this?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.461
How're you feelin'?

27:50.545 --> 27:53.047
Brady?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.049
Hey, Buddy.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.677
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

27:57.760 --> 28:01.889
Well, um , I guess
I kinda got resurrected.

28:01.973 --> 28:03.599
What? Are you
out of your mind?

28:03.683 --> 28:04.934
<i>(Buddy)
Okay. Easy now.</i>

28:05.017 --> 28:06.477
Hold on
to him now.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.813
No. Let go of me.
Let me go.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.648
Not until you calm
down , you won't.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.400
You had him tell
me you were dead?

28:12.483 --> 28:14.443
<i>(Bill)
With a fucking
cross bow?</i>

28:14.569 --> 28:18.322
I'm sorry about that.
But there weren't no other
way to get you to come here.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.032
Ow. Ow.

28:20.116 --> 28:23.452
Oh. Down here for what?

28:23.536 --> 28:25.454
I'm gettin' married.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.999
<i>As if I care.
What kind of
excuse is that?</i>

28:28.082 --> 28:29.292
And I'm having a baby.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.918
<i>You're gonna be an uncle.</i>

28:31.002 --> 28:34.088
Who would be
dumb enough to have
a child with you?

28:34.171 --> 28:35.882
<i>(female)
I would.</i>

28:37.884 --> 28:39.468
<i>(Brady)
Remember the Dentons?</i>

28:39.552 --> 28:40.761
<i>On Zunis back home?</i>

28:40.845 --> 28:42.388
Colleen Denton?

28:42.471 --> 28:44.015
You remember.

28:44.098 --> 28:47.768
I baby sat
you when we were
in high school.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.814
You was my favorite.

28:51.898 --> 28:55.026
You used to sit
in the kitchen
reading books.

28:55.109 --> 28:58.446
I got to watch all
the TV I wanted as long
as I kept the door shut.

28:58.571 --> 29:02.158
<i>You read me
Shakespeare sonnets
when I was going to sleep.</i>

29:02.241 --> 29:04.911
And now you're
going to marry
this pothead?

29:04.994 --> 29:06.454
Uh , he's not no more.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.080
I'm leaving
all that behind.

29:08.164 --> 29:11.292
Oh , uh , yeah ,
I can see the evidence
for that everywhere.

29:11.417 --> 29:15.296
I get to keep on smokin'
'til the baby comes and then
it's cold turkey on that too.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.925
But me and Bolger's
gonna double hit it 'til
the bottom drops out, huh?

29:19.008 --> 29:21.719
Uh , what a great time.

29:21.844 --> 29:25.765
Anyway. You know what?
I wanna leave as quickly
and painlessly as possible.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.391
Just stay
through the weekend.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.517
No.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.852
You can
go see Mom.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.646
Look, Brady.
I am leaving.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.690
What you
did here is cruel
and irresponsible

29:34.774 --> 29:36.275
and exactly
why I stay away.

29:36.359 --> 29:39.028
Bill, you know
I read every goddamn
article you write?

29:39.111 --> 29:42.239
I read 50 pages
on the interpretation
of one word in Aristotle.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.700
Sat the whole fuckin'
day with the dictionary,

29:44.784 --> 29:47.578
and not
the Merriam-Webster,
the motherfuckin' O. E. D.

29:47.662 --> 29:51.082
<i>20 people in the world
read whole piece. You're
lookin' at one of 'em.</i>

29:51.165 --> 29:54.210
What do you want,
Brady? I mean , what
do you fuckin' want?

29:54.293 --> 29:57.046
I just wanna see
my brother who I love.
What's the crime?

29:57.129 --> 30:00.049
Why couldn't you pick up
the phone and call me,

30:00.132 --> 30:02.301
just ask me to come,
like any normal person?

30:02.385 --> 30:04.428
Because when I do
you never call me back.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.555
And if you did ,
you'd just say no.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.265
Am I lyin'?

30:08.349 --> 30:09.642
Well, am I lyin'?

30:09.725 --> 30:13.354
No. No, you're not.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.440
Why--

30:16.524 --> 30:18.025
We ain't bad people, Billy.

30:18.109 --> 30:19.443
I know you're not.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.529
You know Mom
put herself in a home?

30:21.612 --> 30:22.863
A rest home?

30:22.947 --> 30:24.115
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:24.198 --> 30:25.366
Jesus.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.742
<i>You want her to die</i>

30:26.826 --> 30:28.744
<i>and you don't
even come to say goodbye?</i>

30:28.828 --> 30:30.246
Is she still using drugs?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.623
<i>Just go see her
and find out for yourself.</i>

30:32.707 --> 30:34.667
I can't. I--

30:34.750 --> 30:36.961
I just can't.
I can't go and--

30:37.086 --> 30:40.214
What the hell did any of us
ever do that made you
hate us this way?

30:40.297 --> 30:42.675
I don't hate you.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.093
I really don't. I just--

30:44.176 --> 30:46.095
<i>Where you're from
don't matter to you?</i>

30:46.178 --> 30:48.139
<i>Your family?
Your own fuckin' brother?</i>

30:48.222 --> 30:51.434
<i>Look. I try to live
my life with a purposeful
measure of control.</i>

30:51.517 --> 30:54.395
I adhere to certain
philosophic tenants

30:54.478 --> 30:56.188
that were laid down
centuries ago

30:56.272 --> 30:58.524
by some very
introspective thinkers.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.402
I'm talking about three
fuckin' days in Idabel.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.615
Son of a bitch.

31:06.699 --> 31:10.161
Okay, look. I will stay
through the weekend.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.163
<i>(Bill)
But then I'm out of here.</i>

31:12.246 --> 31:13.998
Do you understand?

31:14.081 --> 31:15.624
Yeah , well.
You son of a bitch.

31:15.708 --> 31:19.462
Hey, hey.
Don't fuck around.
Stop. Jesus.

31:26.677 --> 31:27.970
<i>(Bill)
My God.</i>

31:28.054 --> 31:30.431
I think he thought
we were selling dime bags.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.932
What is all this?

31:32.016 --> 31:34.685
Well, let me enlighten
you on a point or two.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.854
It all starts
in the Mommy room.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.482
And you got
your young'uns
over here. Your juvies.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.484
And your adults
in the back.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.736
<i>(Brady)
All these lights
are sodium vapor,</i>

31:43.819 --> 31:45.654
<i>Hortilux HP thousand watts,</i>

31:45.738 --> 31:48.824
<i>and an incandescent's
got too much far red
in the spectrum.</i>

31:48.908 --> 31:50.910
Makes the plant
grow too tall
on the stem

31:50.993 --> 31:54.080
and the leaves get
all narrow, the whole
thing just keels over.

31:54.205 --> 31:57.583
Plus, it reduces the potency,
which is definitely
not what we want.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.877
<i>(Brady)
Now, LED is getting
to be all the rage</i>

31:59.960 --> 32:02.505
'cause it's cooler
and it saves you
on power costs.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.924
But, I'm
a sodium vapor man.

32:05.007 --> 32:08.344
We got your electronic
digital ballasts

32:08.427 --> 32:10.429
Hey, raise her up, Bolger!

32:13.682 --> 32:14.934
And who built all this?

32:15.017 --> 32:16.185
Me and Bolger.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.938
<i>(Brady)
Some buddies helped.</i>

32:19.021 --> 32:20.523
Your brother
designed it all.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.149
<i>The horticulture part.</i>

32:22.233 --> 32:25.319
Quonset hut
comes in catalog kit.
A kid could assemble it.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.696
<i>We should've
got a contractor
to pour the pad,</i>

32:27.780 --> 32:29.532
but we couldn't
hire one, could we?

32:29.615 --> 32:31.951
What-- What are all these?

32:32.034 --> 32:34.161
Oh , NFT spiral system.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.371
<i>NFT?</i>

32:35.454 --> 32:37.039
Yeah. Nutrient
Film Technique.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.875
No soil in there.
The pipes are filled
with hydro-clay.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.671
<i>It's like an expanded
clay aggregate. Supports
the active capillaries.</i>

32:43.796 --> 32:46.882
<i>It's just that
and coconut husks,
if you can believe that shit.</i>

32:46.966 --> 32:51.220
No acid.
No alkaline in the base.
Total sterile medium.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.890
You're looking
at seven generations
of hybridization cloning.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.852
They're all
my special
little children.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.895
And we feed you
good too, don't we?

32:59.979 --> 33:03.065
<i>Pump the nutrients
in up into the medium
from underneath.</i>

33:03.149 --> 33:05.901
<i>Big Bud, Connoisseur,
Nirvana, Jungle Juice</i>

33:05.985 --> 33:08.445
Tarantula,
the whole shiterie.

33:08.529 --> 33:13.325
You're looking
at the motherfuckin'
state-of-the-art.

33:15.286 --> 33:16.662
I don't know what to say.

33:16.787 --> 33:19.373
Hear that?
We rendered him speechless.
[chuckles]

33:19.456 --> 33:21.834
You wanna try some?

33:21.917 --> 33:24.837
<i>No. I make my living
with my mind,</i>

33:24.920 --> 33:26.881
and so I like
to keep it clear.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.716
I forgot who
I was talking to.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.218
You travel
in philosophic space time.

33:31.343 --> 33:36.056
Shit. Let's sit on the porch.
I got a new varietal. I gotta
give her a test drive.

33:38.100 --> 33:41.270
Now, I read a article
you wrote in the New
York Review of Books,

33:41.353 --> 33:43.105
about a fellar
called Heidegigger.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.273
Heidegger?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.400
That's the one.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.277
What fuck kinda
name is that?

33:48.402 --> 33:52.907
(Bill)
No. It was a review
of a book exploring
Lacan's take on Heidegger.

33:53.032 --> 33:56.493
Exactly. And that right there
is what I don't understand
about y'all.

33:56.577 --> 33:59.163
Right? Y'all ever,
hardly ever write
about a topic.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.333
You write about what
some other fella wrote
about the topic.

34:02.458 --> 34:06.503
<i>So Heidegigger's got some idea
and then some French guy's
got a, got a take on that</i>

34:06.587 --> 34:09.715
then you write
a review of that and some
other fella comes along

34:09.797 --> 34:11.132
and on and on
and on and on.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.594
You've very neatly
explained academia, Brady.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.931
<i>I'll write an essay for y'all.</i>
Called What the Fuck's
the Point?

34:17.014 --> 34:19.350
<i>Yeah. I think
this is right
about where I leave.</i>

34:19.433 --> 34:21.560
Come on. Come on. Hey.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.395
Get you a tug on that.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.022
I said no.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.650
You used to do
this more than I did.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.152
Well, I just don't
do it any more.

34:30.235 --> 34:34.239
Oh , I know
you want some. It's
written all of your face.

34:34.364 --> 34:38.452
<i>The shit I grow is better
than anything you're gonna
taste anywhere.</i>

34:38.534 --> 34:41.163
<i>That Jamaica shit we
used to buy tasted
like tobacco.</i>

34:41.246 --> 34:42.331
I bet it does.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.333
A tiny taste.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.335
Little, little
bitty old taste.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.628
Just p--

34:47.710 --> 34:49.338
[playful]
Give it a taste.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.422
Fine. Fine.

34:51.507 --> 34:55.052
Fuck. I don't believe
I'm doing this. This
is so fucking stupid.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.929
When was the last
time you did this?

34:57.012 --> 34:58.597
[chuckles]
Graduate school?

34:58.681 --> 35:02.226
Hot damn , this
is gonna lay you out.
[chuckles]

35:02.309 --> 35:03.811
You remember
the first time?

35:03.894 --> 35:04.937
With Ma?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.438
I remember.

35:06.522 --> 35:07.982
Fucking ridiculous.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.775
Fuckin' ridiculous.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.070
I guess she just figured
we were gonna find out
on our own anyway.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.948
I don't wanna
know what she was
thinking about.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.783
[bubbling sound]

35:23.622 --> 35:25.916
Oh , come on.
Give it a real pull there.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.840
<i>Now, how many buds
is you gonna smoke</i>

35:32.923 --> 35:37.803
that's smooth
after you ain't done it
in a number of years?

35:37.886 --> 35:40.889
<i>I've lengthened
the curing process
in the Dutch tradition.</i>

35:40.973 --> 35:42.725
And I got the right
amount of resin.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.518
Wow.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.898
Yeah.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.526
<i>Easy now, Doctor. Oh.</i>

35:52.609 --> 35:56.989
[chuckles]

35:59.992 --> 36:01.493
Ah.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.079
[sighs]

36:04.163 --> 36:06.790
Now we're cookin'.

36:06.915 --> 36:11.754
So, anyways. I seem to recall
you didn't think too much
of this fella Heidegigger.

36:11.837 --> 36:15.507
What? No. He was
a fucking fascist.

36:15.591 --> 36:18.010
He helped out
the National Socialists.

36:18.135 --> 36:23.474
All right.
But this article was
about logic and , and truth ,

36:23.557 --> 36:27.311
and how him
and some other fella
related to, uh--

36:27.394 --> 36:28.562
Analytic philosophy.

36:28.645 --> 36:29.646
What was it?

36:29.730 --> 36:31.106
Analytic philosophy.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.441
Analytic philosophy.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.651
Analytic philosophy.

36:34.735 --> 36:37.946
There was one word
I didn't know. I had
to look it up. Epista--

36:38.030 --> 36:39.031
Epistemology.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.115
Espista what?

36:40.199 --> 36:41.700
Epistemology.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.327
Epistemology. Bingo!

36:43.410 --> 36:44.912
Why are we
talking about this?

36:46.747 --> 36:48.207
Just solving problems.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.168
Just solving problems.

36:51.210 --> 36:54.963
Like, like
when all of a sudden
you get hit with the answer,

36:55.047 --> 36:57.091
to a mess you been in.

36:57.216 --> 37:01.178
And as soon as it hit you ,
you can't hardly believe you
didn't think of it before.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.472
What is it
you want, Brady?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.516
Ju-- You get you
another pull on that.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.434
No. I'm fucking
euthanized , uh--

37:07.518 --> 37:09.186
Go on now.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.979
Go on.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.276
[sighs]
Alright. Look.
Here's the thing.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.904
All that equipment
you seen out yonder?

37:18.987 --> 37:20.697
It was expensive.

37:20.823 --> 37:23.826
So I had to see
this Jew in Tulsa
who's kinda in the business.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.994
What do you mean
he's in the business?

37:26.078 --> 37:27.830
Well, the dope
dealing business.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.207
A Jew in the busi--
How do you now
he's a Jew?

37:30.290 --> 37:32.501
Well, he,
trust me. He's a Jew.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.212
Well, what
does that mean? He
has a Jewish last name?

37:35.295 --> 37:36.296
He's a goddamn Jew.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.548
Don't be anti-Semitic.

37:37.631 --> 37:38.674
<i>Anti-what?</i>

37:38.757 --> 37:39.883
Anti-Jew.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.969
I ain't anti-Jew.
I loves everybody.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.638
<i>Oh, Jesus. So, okay.
He's a dope dealer.
So what?</i>

37:44.721 --> 37:48.183
Well, no, he's not really
a dealer. He's a bit more
upstream than that.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.144
<i>But I been his main
supplier of grass.</i>

37:50.227 --> 37:51.520
I still don't see.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.814
Will you listen?
You know, you never listen.

37:53.897 --> 37:57.067
Okay. Okay. Fine.
I'm listening.

37:57.151 --> 37:59.736
I need you to be me.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.196
What?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.907
Down here,
just like we used to
back at home

38:03.991 --> 38:06.827
while I go up there
and figure out this
whole situation.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.705
No fucking chance, Brady.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.498
I got this one figured.
So simple.

38:11.582 --> 38:13.917
All you gotta do
is go and visit Mom.

38:14.001 --> 38:16.587
You think Mom won't
know the difference
between us?

38:16.670 --> 38:19.131
It ain't about Mom ,
goddamn it. It's the Sheriff.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.799
<i>It's him
we're gonna fool.</i>

38:20.883 --> 38:22.968
We don't even
look alike anymore.

38:23.051 --> 38:26.472
Bolger said that
it took five seconds
for the Fuller boys

38:26.555 --> 38:28.724
to think it was me
with a shave and a haircut.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.601
Which is why
he took me to Broken Bow.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.394
He said
you wanted a Coke.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.897
Brady. Brady.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.608
I swear to God.

38:37.691 --> 38:38.859
<i>Even for you--</i>

38:38.942 --> 38:40.736
That might have been
Bolger's idea,

38:40.819 --> 38:42.488
but I didn't
know nothin' about it

38:42.571 --> 38:44.156
until you all showed up here.

38:44.198 --> 38:47.075
We're going back
to Broken Bow and whoop
some country ass.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.827
<i>No, you're not.
No, we're not--</i>

38:48.911 --> 38:51.330
<i>(Colleen)
Hey, honey.
Y'all started
without us?</i>

38:51.455 --> 38:54.458
<i>(Brady)
Well, you know
you can't have none
of this good stuff.</i>

38:54.583 --> 38:57.336
I know, but
I'm being polite
'cause the rest of them can.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.922
That is so weird.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.341
Sorry, Janet.
Uh , this is my
dear brother Bill,

39:02.424 --> 39:04.259
<i>Bill, this our
good friend, Janet.</i>

39:04.343 --> 39:05.677
Hi. I'm Bill.

39:05.761 --> 39:07.429
Are you having
a smoke?

39:07.513 --> 39:08.597

39:08.680 --> 39:10.682
Oh , you want some?

Oh , I'm gonna
get a beer, thanks.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.813
<i>Yeah. I usually
don't either.</i>

39:16.897 --> 39:18.732
Actually, I never do.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.652
It's all right.
Nobody can say
no to Brady.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.987

I got the mojo.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.572
I kinda forgot.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.075
Bolger says
you're a famous,
what was it?

39:28.158 --> 39:29.535
Famous thinker.

39:29.618 --> 39:30.702
"Famous thinker."

39:30.786 --> 39:31.995
He's real famous.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.373
In certain esoteric
circles, well, maybe.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.083
And they pay
you for that?

39:36.166 --> 39:40.170
Well, I mean , I ,
I lecture and I ,
I teach , I am a professor.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.172

She's a poet.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.475
What?

39:53.559 --> 39:55.686
Seriously. She writes
fuckin' poetry.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.814
And she's the Ladies

of 'em go for it.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.540

You do understand
that, right?

40:16.623 --> 40:18.083
I'm not
gonna participate--

40:18.166 --> 40:19.376
No. We'll
talk later.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.461
Hey, Bolger,

Here in town.

High school?

41:51.093 --> 41:53.387
I tried
the tenure track,

41:53.470 --> 41:57.015
but college
students are already

48:02.338 --> 48:06.551
Oh , it's not a good deed
and I really don't
wanna see Mom.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.178
<i>You come
all the way down here.</i>

48:08.261 --> 48:11.264
No. You tricked me
into coming , actually.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.808
Oh , will you ,
it, it's so simple.

48:13.892 --> 48:17.353
All you gotta do is walk
into a fuckin' rest home
and see your own mother

48:17.437 --> 48:19.814
who you ain't
seen in 12 years
for God knows why.

48:19.898 --> 48:22.650
And on the way
you're gonna pass
a pig eating a bear claw.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.486
They don't call them
that anymore.

48:24.569 --> 48:28.823
They aren't called
"pigs" any more.
That's exactly--

48:28.907 --> 48:30.450
So a police.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.494
How do you even know
that he'll be there?

48:32.577 --> 48:35.955
'Cause he got a shine
on this heifer who sits
behind the desk.

48:36.039 --> 48:39.084
All you gotta do
is walk in and say,
Hi ya, Sharon

48:39.209 --> 48:42.921
I'm goin' see my Ma.
And don't say another fuckin'
word and just walk on by.

48:43.004 --> 48:44.798
That is the most
ridiculous alibi.

48:44.923 --> 48:48.510
All anyone would have to do
is find out you have a twin
and that I was here.

48:48.593 --> 48:50.178
When we ever been
busted before?

48:50.261 --> 48:51.971
You took tests
for me all the time.

48:52.055 --> 48:53.515
<i>And I let you go
on dates as me.</i>

48:53.598 --> 48:56.684
No. I did that one time
when we were 16.

48:56.768 --> 48:58.436
She guzzled your
custard , right?

48:58.520 --> 49:00.688
I have felt bad
about that ever since.

49:00.772 --> 49:03.191
Come on , Billy.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.193
I'm trying to change
my life here.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.445
Fucking hell.

49:07.529 --> 49:09.906
I'm asking as your brother.

49:09.989 --> 49:13.118
Uh , I just walk by.

49:13.201 --> 49:16.746
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

49:25.630 --> 49:27.465
Say, ain't it Saturday?

49:27.549 --> 49:28.883
Yeah , so?

49:28.967 --> 49:31.427
Think the Jews
is in church Saturdays.

49:31.511 --> 49:33.471
You know
where it's at?

49:33.555 --> 49:35.306
Can't we look it up?

49:35.390 --> 49:37.475
Well, what if
it's more <i>'n</i> one?

49:39.144 --> 49:41.479
There can't be more
than one, can there?

49:46.234 --> 49:47.569
Can I ask
you a question?

49:47.652 --> 49:48.695
Shoot.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.907
Do you believe
in a higher power?

49:55.326 --> 49:57.245
Yeah , I do.

49:57.370 --> 50:02.250
It's the only way to make
sense of all this. Otherwise
it's just pure fuckin' chaos.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.920
Like where we was
created by Him

50:06.004 --> 50:07.839
and He judges
what we do?

50:07.922 --> 50:12.552
No. I think
it's more like,
like, parallel lines.

50:12.635 --> 50:15.054
Parallel lines?

50:15.138 --> 50:18.266
You know, like two lines
go on and on forever
don't never touch.

50:18.349 --> 50:19.559
Yeah.

50:21.394 --> 50:25.231
'Cept, 'cept they don't
actually exist in nature.

50:25.315 --> 50:28.318
And man can't create
no true parallel.

50:28.401 --> 50:31.613
It's just
more of a concept.

50:31.696 --> 50:34.240
I learned that shit
in high school geometry.

50:34.324 --> 50:36.868
Uh-huh.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.495
Well that concept,

50:39.579 --> 50:42.248
that perfection ,

50:42.332 --> 50:44.250
we know it exists.

50:44.334 --> 50:46.127
And we think about it,

50:46.211 --> 50:48.254
But we can never
get there ourselves.

50:51.216 --> 50:53.468
I think that
right there is God.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.025
(Janet)
You ready?

51:09.108 --> 51:10.151
For what?

51:10.235 --> 51:11.903
Come on over here.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.663
Jeez--

51:21.746 --> 51:23.122
You just gonna
stand there?

51:25.959 --> 51:27.043
<i>[laughs]</i>

51:33.466 --> 51:36.135
You have a spiritual
aversion to monofilament?

51:36.219 --> 51:38.012
[chuckles]

51:38.137 --> 51:43.810
(Janet)
This is
the way it was done
1000 years ago.

51:43.893 --> 51:46.980
I think
I can understand that.

51:47.063 --> 51:49.107
You still leaving tomorrow?

51:51.359 --> 51:53.361
I think so.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.530
I'll miss you.

51:55.613 --> 51:59.117
And we barely
even know each other.

52:01.536 --> 52:04.330
You have not known
What you are

52:04.414 --> 52:07.250
You have slumbered
Upon yourself
All your life.

52:07.333 --> 52:10.753
Your eyelids have been
The same as closed
Most of the time.

52:10.837 --> 52:14.632
What you have done
Returns already in mockeries.

52:14.716 --> 52:17.552
The mockeries are not you.

52:17.635 --> 52:23.308
Underneath them
and within them ,
I see you lurk.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.063
Who is that?

52:30.189 --> 52:31.649
<i>Walt Whitman</i>

52:33.234 --> 52:35.945
I don't think
I ever imagined
hearing him recited to me

52:36.029 --> 52:38.197
by a girl gutting
a 40-pound catfish.

52:38.281 --> 52:41.200
That's exactly how
he should be recited.

52:41.284 --> 52:43.411
<i>He wrote
without rhyme or meter.</i>

52:43.494 --> 52:45.913
Free verse.
Just whatever
he felt inside

52:45.997 --> 52:49.000
<i>coming out in its
own intricate rhythm.</i>

52:49.083 --> 52:52.003
Pure, unashamed passion

52:52.086 --> 52:54.630
without
definable restriction.

52:54.714 --> 52:57.383
<i>I'm sorry. See, I have
a few issues with that.</i>

52:57.467 --> 52:58.676
Why?

52:58.760 --> 53:00.928
Because, some
have dared to suggest

53:01.012 --> 53:02.972
that even
poetry has rules.

53:03.056 --> 53:05.141
Or you make your own.

53:05.224 --> 53:07.935
Right there.
That's the part
I never bought into.

53:08.019 --> 53:09.854
Because?

53:09.937 --> 53:13.441
<i>If everybody
runs around making their
own rules, how can you</i>

53:13.524 --> 53:15.443
find what's true?

53:15.526 --> 53:20.198
<i>There's nothing--
There's nothing to rely on.</i>

53:22.867 --> 53:25.244
One night

53:25.328 --> 53:28.748
I split my cicada skin

53:28.831 --> 53:31.250
<i>devoured your leaves</i>

53:31.334 --> 53:36.547
knowing no poison ,
no law of nourishment

53:36.631 --> 53:39.675
in that larval blindness

53:39.759 --> 53:42.637
a hunger finally true.

53:45.348 --> 53:46.891
Who's that?

53:46.974 --> 53:48.893
That's me.

53:57.026 --> 53:59.987
Maybe what's true
is in front of us

54:00.071 --> 54:03.408
and we're moving
toward it without
even knowing it's there.

54:05.618 --> 54:10.331
Once you think
you've got it all
solved , what's left?

54:19.507 --> 54:21.759
Don't get any fish
innards on me, okay?

54:21.843 --> 54:23.970
[chuckles softly]
Shut up.

54:45.867 --> 54:49.871
So what is the Halacha?

54:49.954 --> 54:51.873
It's the law.

54:51.956 --> 54:55.877
<i>(Rabbi)
It's the path that we
follow in our daily lives.</i>

54:55.960 --> 54:58.796
<i>It comprises those rituals</i>

54:58.880 --> 55:02.049
<i>that make our lives complete.</i>

55:02.133 --> 55:07.388
<i>Without them,
the violence and anarchy
of the world prevail.</i>

55:07.472 --> 55:11.392
<i>While Moses
talks with God on Sinai</i>

55:11.476 --> 55:13.686
<i>the Jews abandon law</i>

55:13.769 --> 55:16.814
<i>and dance ecstatically
before the calf</i>

55:16.898 --> 55:20.067
forgetting the one who
brought them out of Egypt.

55:20.193 --> 55:24.030
<i>My friends,
in every generation,
we are threatened with chaos</i>

55:24.113 --> 55:27.241
<i>and slavery and despair.</i>

55:27.325 --> 55:30.578
<i>And in this
dispiriting confusion,</i>

55:30.661 --> 55:35.541
<i>Halacha allows refuge
in a world we can't explain.</i>

55:35.625 --> 55:38.461
A world of violence

55:38.544 --> 55:41.547
<i>anarchy in which though
the workings of justice</i>

55:41.631 --> 55:45.176
<i>may falter
there is a larger
and deeper coherence.</i>

55:45.259 --> 55:46.844
Who the fuck is that?

55:46.928 --> 55:49.805
<i>To know this with certainty</i>

55:49.889 --> 55:51.766
<i>is to believe as Jew.</i>

55:51.849 --> 55:54.602
<i>Without law</i>

55:54.685 --> 55:56.103
<i>we are lost</i>

55:56.187 --> 55:57.939
Fuck if I know.

55:58.022 --> 56:01.359
<i>In an arid wasteland
no good to each other.</i>

56:01.442 --> 56:03.778
Not this place.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.363
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

56:05.446 --> 56:07.532
Okay. Okay.

<i>So I would like to thank
the Hauptman family</i>

<i>for Kiddush in the Kaiser

56:29.679 --> 56:31.847
Well, thanks
for doing this.

56:31.931 --> 56:33.766
Happy to.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.979
All right.

56:38.062 --> 56:40.314
You sure you don't
want to come in?

56:40.398 --> 56:42.608
I'll be waiting
right over there.

56:42.692 --> 56:47.029
But we'll look kindly later
on boys who sort shit out
with their mommas.

56:49.115 --> 56:51.075
How do I look?

56:51.158 --> 56:53.494
[chuckles]

56:58.499 --> 57:00.126
Well, hey, Sharon.

57:00.209 --> 57:02.378
Uh , just gonna
see my mom.

57:02.461 --> 57:04.714
Officer.

57:07.091 --> 57:09.135
Oh. Oh. Uh--

57:11.596 --> 57:14.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, big fella. Oh. Okay.

57:14.682 --> 57:18.686
No, no,
not a word from you ,
Brady, you hear?

57:18.769 --> 57:21.355
You just gonna listen.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.860
The staff here,
they found your momma
smoking pot the other day.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.863
Now, she's
a crazy lady, don't
even belong in here.

57:28.946 --> 57:31.490
But it wouldn't
do nobody no good
to put her away.

57:31.574 --> 57:34.452
The only reason
I ain't hauling you in

57:34.535 --> 57:37.413
is 'cause I ain't
got proof it was you
who give it to her.

57:37.496 --> 57:38.873
<i>But as soon as I do</i>

57:38.956 --> 57:40.750
<i>we're gonna get
on your property</i>

57:40.875 --> 57:46.255
and we're gonna find
every last ounce of that
super-charged grass you grow.

57:46.339 --> 57:49.133
I don't care how many
of my men you pay off.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.052
<i>Do you understand?</i>

57:51.135 --> 57:53.262
Yes, sir.

58:00.436 --> 58:02.313
[sniggers]

58:04.440 --> 58:08.944
And you ain't fooling
a soul by cleaning up.

58:13.783 --> 58:16.702
I know just
what you is.

58:24.627 --> 58:27.004
<i>(Pug)
That ain't at all
what I asked you,</i>

58:27.088 --> 58:32.259
<i>I asked you why
you supposed to be
here three days ago</i>

58:32.343 --> 58:34.345
<i>and you just
walk in here now.</i>

58:34.428 --> 58:37.848
We had some business
back at home we had
to take care of is all.

58:37.932 --> 58:41.143
I heard you made
an appearance
at Broken Bow.

58:41.227 --> 58:44.438
<i>Well, I just stopped
in at the Metotem
there and--</i>

58:44.522 --> 58:46.565
My girl wanted
some licorice.

58:46.649 --> 58:49.610
<i>Everybody knows
those Fuller boys work
out at the Metotem</i>

58:49.694 --> 58:52.571
Even the police
know that.

58:52.655 --> 58:54.949
She wanted
the licorice.

58:55.032 --> 58:58.244
<i>I sure
hope my money's
in yonder bag.</i>

58:58.327 --> 59:00.287
Well, that's
just, uh--

59:00.413 --> 59:04.709
<i>Either that or you got
samples of what you're
gonna be up to down there.</i>

59:04.792 --> 59:07.962
Don't tell me you done
interrupted my day of rest

59:08.045 --> 59:12.341
to utter shit I got
no interest making
its way between my ears.

59:12.425 --> 59:14.218
We went to the wrong
temple at first.

59:14.301 --> 59:15.803
Temple Israel.

59:15.886 --> 59:17.304
Over there on Utica?

59:17.388 --> 59:20.474
If I wanted
to go to church ,
I'd be a Christian.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.059
Might make
your life easier.

59:22.143 --> 59:24.353
Who says
my life ain't easy?

59:24.437 --> 59:27.523
<i>I don't know.
Maybe folks ain't
too partial to Jews.</i>

59:27.606 --> 59:31.235
<i>The law would
never mark out a Jew
as a dope dealer neither.</i>

59:31.318 --> 59:33.988
<i>They leave me alone,
by and large.</i>

59:34.071 --> 59:37.283
Way of the world
is mysterious.

59:37.366 --> 59:41.787
<i>But every man has his place,
each according to his lights.</i>

59:41.871 --> 59:43.372
That could be.

59:43.456 --> 59:48.711
Shaver and Waddell
done presented to you
a deal, Brady.

59:48.794 --> 59:52.131
An opportunity.

59:52.214 --> 59:56.677
Now, either you got
my money in that bag

59:56.761 --> 01:00:00.639
or we're gonna talk
about expanding your
situation down there.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:02.725
Well, I can't
do neither.

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.351
Why not?

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.729
I'm gonna have a family.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:10.566
And I ain't never
had a dad myself so
I aim to be a good one.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.276
So I'm done.

01:00:12.318 --> 01:00:15.738
I might grow
for myself, but not
for you or nobody no more.

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:18.032
<i>At least not
in a selling capacity.</i>

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:23.204
So, that's a bag full
of money paying me back
for setting you up.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.872
Well, hear me out, Pug.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:28.209
That's gettin' harder
because of all the shit
I'm listening to.

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:32.421
Okay, look. Me and Bolger,
we're gonna take that whole
operation that you paid for

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:34.173
we'll haul it up
to Broken Bow.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.884
We'll set it up,
turn it over to
the Fuller Brothers.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.969
<i>I'm gonna teach them
everything I know.</i>

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:41.388
[chuckles]

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:46.268
You can take Bobby
Fuller's brain and stick it
in the head of a cat

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.979
and that animal
would keel over and die.

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:52.107
Me and Bolger will
do whatever it takes.

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:54.527
Who is paying me back?

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:58.239
<i>I'm working on that,

01:11:45.844 --> 01:11:47.053
Ugh.

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:50.515
[phone rings]

01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:52.851
Oh , answer
the phone.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.060
Colleen'll get it.

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:56.646
Just answer
the fucking phone.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.195
Hello?

01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:06.406
No, it ain't.
It's his brother.

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.700
What? Who?
Who is it?

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.660
Well, he's
right here. Hang on.

01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:14.331
Hello?

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:16.917
Bill. Uh , Nathan Levy.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.085
Nathan! N--

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.379
Ugh.

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:24.174
<i>How did you, how
did you get this number?</i>

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.800
Don't you fucking move.

01:12:25.884 --> 01:12:27.552
<i>(Levy)
I hope you don't mind.</i>

01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:29.846
I , uh , spoke to Maggie
Harmon down at Brown.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.433
<i>(Levy)
Is this a bad time?</i>

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:36.811
It's fine.
Uh , you know what?
Give me one second.

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:39.940
Ooh , ooh , sorry.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.071
Sorry, Nathan ,
go ahead.

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:49.157
Well, you didn't hear
this from me, Bill.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:51.535
But you're about
to be ambushed down there.

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.828
By whom?

01:12:53.912 --> 01:12:56.289
Something about
a coed and a poem.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:13:00.126
<i>And some other behavior
which I would rather
allow you to infer.</i>

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.586
What?

01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:04.089
You've gotta be kidding.
Nobody would say that.

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.800
<i>Apparently there
was a witness, Bill.</i>

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:13.807
Nathan. Na--, Nathan.
Listen to me. That is absurd.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.850
That's why I'm reaching out.

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:18.395
But until whatever
happened blows over

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:19.980
<i>we can't--</i>

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:21.106
I understand.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.192
Everything all right?

01:13:24.276 --> 01:13:25.777
No, it isn't.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.821
Now, where can I find
a signal for this?

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:31.992
<i>(Anne)
I wrote a poem
for you in Latin
for when you got back.</i>

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:35.453
<i>It was a send-up of Virgil
in dactylic hexameter.</i>

01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:38.832
And it was all about
what would happen if
we were together in mi--

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.918
Stop. Inappropriate.

01:13:42.002 --> 01:13:43.837
I don't want to hear it.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.382
<i>So I was in the library
and Mark Loeb read it
over my shoulder.</i>

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.925
He sight-translated it?

01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:50.385
<i>I know. He was really good.</i>

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:53.054
It had like five
hortatory subjunctives.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:57.767
<i>Anne! Didn't you tell him
that it was a fucking poem,
that it never happened?</i>

01:13:57.851 --> 01:13:59.477
Yes, but he
didn't believe me.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:01.354
So he went
to the department.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:04.316
<i>I guess he was
pissed about some
B plus you gave him</i>

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.359
<i>on a Lucretius paper
last year.</i>

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.028
Fucking hell!

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.863
Did you give him a B plus?

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.616
I don't remember, Anne.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:14.993
So that bitch ,
Maggie Harmon ,

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:19.247
said she caught us that day
making out with my shirt off
in your office.

01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:20.582
Oh.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:23.251
So I went to her
and I told her the truth

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:25.170
and I begged her.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:29.591
<i>But since the door
was closed and I was
partially undressed.</i>

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:33.762
<i>And then Professor
Laughlin said that
in the world of phenomena</i>

01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:36.765
<i>appearances are truth,
going around quoting
the cynics.</i>

01:14:36.848 --> 01:14:38.558
<i>He's such
a fucking lightweight!</i>

01:14:38.642 --> 01:14:41.561
I know. I , I don't
wanna hear anymore.

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:45.023
<i>Bill, when
are coming home?</i>

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.191
<i>(Staci)
Stop it.</i>

01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:47.776
I told you
to leave Staci alone.

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:50.487
(Gabe)
She's been
on my nerves
since Hebrew school.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:51.571
Eat shit, Gabe.

01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:53.406
Right after
you eat mine.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.742
<i>Don't you dare
speak to anyone
that way!</i>

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.078
<i>(Staci)
He cusses all the time,
and so do you.</i>

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.705
You both
made spectacles
of yourselves back there.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.417
<i>(Gabe)
The pizza there sucks
compared to the pizza
in New York!</i>

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:06.961
Well it is the pizza
that we have!

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:09.923
And by the way,
did I hear you ask
your mother for money?

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:11.758
Honey, I don't
wanna talk about it.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.093
<i>Don't you have
any pride?</i>

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.219
Of course I do.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:15.637
It's your mother!

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.933
We're strangling , Suzie.
The credit bills alone.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.893
Now until
I get my practice up--

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:24.062
<i>(Suzie)
When? When?</i>

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:27.440

<i>When the kids</i>
<i>make friends at school</i>

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:29.234
<i>(Gabe)
I hate the kids at school.</i>

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:30.777

a bullet in there that's
gonna pack a wallop.

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:55.945
Yeah , I , I really don't
need , need the bullets.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:17:00.366
None of my business, friend ,

better be ready to use it.

Uh-huh. Well,
uh , see, it's, it's
really more for protection.

I really don't,
I don't plan to chow down.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.643
I'll just take the gun.

Yeah. No.

Had a haircut.
Looked like a choir boy.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:05.431
So, how could
he have been there,
here and in Tulsa?

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:08.434
He was in Tulsa
before he was here.

01:18:08.518 --> 01:18:11.104
This is one
big waste of my time.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.605
And I tell you
what else.

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:15.483
I better not
hear about any

01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:18.528
And do you know
why he would have
been in Tulsa?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.822
No, Buddy.
Educate me.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:25.368
'Cause him and Pug was
fixin' to make a lot more
than grass down here.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:27.328
Who told you that?

<i>Pug Rothbaum. They was
gonna push me and Jimmy
out of Broken Bow.</i>

He owed Pug over 200,000
for the equipment
in his grow house.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:40.258

me the truth , Buddy?

Why are you
doing this?

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:23.379
You flew down here
to be his alibi

making him a murderer
and you an accessory.

Old Testament when
it comes to murder.

01:33:59.635 --> 01:34:00.803
Ah!
[shoots]

01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:06.934
[police sirens]

01:34:15.818 --> 01:34:18.237
<i>(Bolger)
He got shot.
Barbed arrow.</i>

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.446
<i>(male)
How long ago?</i>

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:20.948
<i>(Bolger)
About 10 minutes.</i>

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:28.455
<i>(male)
Keep him on his side.</i>

01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:34.086
<i>(male)
Let's get some vitals.</i>

01:34:40.217 --> 01:34:41.677
<i>378. Give me
a line there.</i>

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.136
<i>Here you go.</i>

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:50.853
<i>(female)
Open it up.</i>

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:56.650
<i>(Doctor)
You folks wanna
come with me?</i>

01:35:03.949 --> 01:35:07.160
Now the arrow missed
his heart by an inch

01:35:07.244 --> 01:35:10.038
and his spine
by centimeters.

01:35:10.122 --> 01:35:13.083
So, what does this
mean for him?

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:15.627
Well, it'll be
a long recovery.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.631
I guess I don't need
to tell you this.

01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:22.134
<i>But you saved his life.</i>

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:30.309
<i>[thunder]</i>

01:35:37.566 --> 01:35:39.234
[baby cries]

01:35:39.318 --> 01:35:41.069
<i>(female)
Yes, yes, yeah.</i>

01:35:42.571 --> 01:35:44.948
Billy, it's fixin' to rain.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.244
Thanks, Mom.

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:04.676
You know,

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.638
I think
I'm just gonna sit
here for awhile.

01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:09.348
In the rain?

01:36:12.643 --> 01:36:17.022
I used to be so scared
of these summer storms.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:20.817
And then when I went
east, I missed them.

01:36:20.943 --> 01:36:24.404
<i>I was so frightened that
I used to hide in the closet
and cover my ears.</i>

01:36:24.488 --> 01:36:26.615
And I hated that.

01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:30.535
So I went to the library

01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:32.704
and I studied them.

01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:35.874
I learned everything
I could about them ,

01:36:35.958 --> 01:36:38.377
how they happened ,
what made them happen ,

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.671
<i>the name of every cloud.</i>

01:36:40.754 --> 01:36:41.797
And?

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:46.468
They still happened.

01:36:47.886 --> 01:36:50.973
You mind if I stay
out here with you?

01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:54.059
I wish you would.

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:56.770
