- Dwayne, honey, pass me a hot dog?
- Yep.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.952
Thanks, hon.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.330
Oh.

02:04.707 --> 02:08.002
I bet Dwayne 20 bucks you'd be down there
for another 30 seconds.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.255
Well, sorry for your loss.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.551
That second weight was a real kicker.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.637
You pay on time, you don't
have to do a Houdini in the drink.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.433
Cut me some slack, Sal.
I always come through.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.937
A few days late and a few grand light.

02:26.020 --> 02:30.233
Well, at least I'm consistent.

02:35.071 --> 02:38.116
You got exactly one week to pay up.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.537
Or we tie on a third plate
and drop you in.

02:42.620 --> 02:46.916
You're gonna get your money.
All of it. On time.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.253
Fifty bucks says he blows it.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.797
I'm not touching that action.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.215
Grandma, look.

03:14.068 --> 03:18.531
Sal gave me a week to get the cash.
I still have... 12 hours left.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.242
So she's not the one
who tried to kill you.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.327
Yet.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.872
Well, who else wants you dead
badly enough to stab your random hookup?

03:25.955 --> 03:29.834
Couple of people might have
left me some cash that needs picking up.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
Left you cash?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.673
I, um...

03:37.467 --> 03:38.927
blackmailed them.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.096
And I'm betting one of them is after me.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.016
So you're a gambler and a blackmailer?

03:45.099 --> 03:48.311
Yeah, but that burger, though, right?

03:48.394 --> 03:52.273
You could have mentioned this when you
knew I was chasing down the wrong guy.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.234
You said you knew who did it.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.237
I figured a super detective
would know her shit.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.155
What do you have on these people?

03:59.822 --> 04:00.949
No idea.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.702
Blackmail only works
when you have dirt on someone.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.666
All I know is they're bad.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.750
Who isn't?

04:11.292 --> 04:16.297
Well, there's something else
I should mention. I'm... like you.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.175
Into burgers and bourbon?

04:20.093 --> 04:24.097
Yeah, but also kind of...

04:26.474 --> 04:27.600
super.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.106
I just... I sense it.
The darkness in people.

04:33.856 --> 04:40.238
The shit they've done,
are doing, or... will do.

04:43.491 --> 04:47.370
<i>The worst ones... they have no guilt.</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:52.083
<i>What I see, I feel...</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:58.381
<i>is a void, a lack of humanity.</i>

05:03.136 --> 05:08.391
And the closer they are, the sharper
the needle in the back of my eye.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.518
Asshole radar.

05:10.601 --> 05:14.897
It... almost sounds like you believe me.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.361
The last time I...
doubted someone's powers,

05:20.445 --> 05:23.823
they ended up impaled by scaffolding.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.911
What else can you do with these powers?

05:28.995 --> 05:33.124
Besides blackmail people
to support your gambling addiction.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.336
Said with no judgement whatsoever.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.630
I'm just saying,
if it isn't bullshit, it...

05:41.090 --> 05:42.175
could come in handy.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.219
It's a nonstop migraine,

05:45.303 --> 05:49.682
relieved only by gambling, booze and sex.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.935
Is that why you missed
the stabber at the door?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.859
Do you have one of those headaches now?

06:01.152 --> 06:02.904
I wouldn't be here if I did.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.657
Start at the beginning.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.203
- How many marks were you targeting?
- Three.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.538
I slipped them anonymous notes.

06:12.622 --> 06:17.502
"I know what you did, pay me" type thing.
I gave 'em drop locations.

06:17.585 --> 06:21.005
And for all I know,
the cash is sitting there right now.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.634
Sure, with a bomb or a scorpion attached.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.345
Or free for the taking.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.352
Give me names, addresses, details.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.730
And I will do some vetting,
check the drops.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.859
If they left money,
we will pay them a visit.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.320
"We," huh?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.073
Someone figured you out
and followed you here.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.828
We go see them, let them see you.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.579
And watch for a tell.

06:54.956 --> 06:59.585
But, uh...
what happens with the money?

06:59.669 --> 07:02.964
I don't care. I have no problems
with a bad guy getting bilked.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.675
I only care about the prick who knifed me.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.684
What's your head say
about whoever's out there?

07:16.811 --> 07:17.937
All clear.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.653
Everything you know about them.
Then, I'll get to work.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.702
Hey.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.414
So, I thought I should let you know
that Brandt is in jail.

07:36.998 --> 07:37.999
I heard.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.294
So whoever attacked you
is still out there.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.880
- I know.
- Let's go get him.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.964
I'm already on it.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.943
If someone attacks you again
while you're still recovering...

07:47.967 --> 07:50.527
They're not after me, they're after him.

07:50.595 --> 07:55.516
Yeah. Look, I can't talk right now.
Calm down.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.600
Who is he?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.813
Um, some guy I picked up at a bar.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.317
And he may have
some special skills I can use.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.819
- Is that a euphemism?
- We're handling it.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.114
Hey, um, call me
when you want to meet up.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.679
Why does someone want him dead?

08:16.704 --> 08:17.997
That's the part we're handling.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.499
While I do nothing.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.418
There are a lot of shitty people
out there.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.214
There's no reason for us to double up.
Go find your own bad guy.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.549
I don't need your help.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.677
And you don't need mine. Okay?

08:32.803 --> 08:33.804
Sure.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.977
Hey, don't worry.
I'll get her her money.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.607
Would you tell Blaskowski to ease off?

08:45.816 --> 08:47.401
I'm gonna see her later.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.945
I am working on it.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.281
No. No, you don't...

09:02.250 --> 09:03.417
"Blaskowski."

09:20.184 --> 09:23.563
<i>Finding the truth
beneath the bullshit...</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:28.651
<i>that's why I got into this line of work
in the first place.</i>

09:33.114 --> 09:34.699
<i>I need to know.</i>

09:37.702 --> 09:39.829
<i>But there are no easy answers.</i>

09:41.872 --> 09:43.165
<i>Unless there are.</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:49.880
<i>Mark number one, Todd White.
Definitely dirty.</i>

09:49.964 --> 09:51.591
Our luck is changing.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.927
Yeah, if you set the bar
at being drowned and stabbed.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.871
Whatever he did, he hides it well.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.223
All I could find on him
was that he's an accountant.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.600
No family, no priors.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.604
Well, cops nab the obvious crooks.
I find the hidden ones.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.275
Jesus. It hurts that bad, huh?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.611
It will when I get close.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.990
One-in-three odds
we're surprising an attempted murderer.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.367
I've faced worse odds.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.001
Maybe he's not home.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.128
<i>Hello?</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:31.005
Delivery.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.882
<i>Leave it in the lobby.</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:35.718
Requires a signature.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.432
Hooray.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.063
It takes two of you to drop off a package?

10:48.230 --> 10:51.192
- He doesn't recognize us. It isn't him.
- Yeah, let's keep moving.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.902
Well... where's my delivery?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.863
There isn't one,
but I have some questions.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.741
If you're with the insurance company,
they have my statement.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.161
- Insurance fraud?
- Maybe.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.705
I fell on a wet
grocery store floor.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.458
It's unprofessional
for an insurance company to accuse a...

11:07.541 --> 11:09.085
Ah! What the hell is wrong with you?

11:09.710 --> 11:12.588
- Well, maybe not.
- Yeah, maybe your power is bullshit.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.298
You're right. Let's go.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.428
Why did you pay the blackmail?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.889
- You left that note?
- Answer the question.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.683
I'm done answering your questions.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.769
You just admitted to extortion,
not to mention assault.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.729
Hey!

11:29.397 --> 11:31.857
- I'm calling the cops!
- No kids, no family, huh?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.657
This is a home invasion!
I'll press charges.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.536
You can't just come
into my home like this!

11:48.165 --> 11:51.085
Stop. You can't just barge in here.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.629
You're trespassing.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.923
This is a private home.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.094
I know this looks strange.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.058
Look, I'm an artist...

12:06.142 --> 12:09.019
Okay. Listen...

12:09.895 --> 12:11.397
It's not what it looks like.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.484
Take it easy.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.486
Hey, don't touch me!

12:20.114 --> 12:22.491
Let me out! Open the door!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.828
Let me out! Open the door!

12:25.911 --> 12:27.431
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

12:27.496 --> 12:31.917
Hi. Someone in apartment B is screaming
that they're trapped in a closet. Help.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.294
<i>Someone will be right there.</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.170
<i>Hello?</i>

12:36.505 --> 12:38.132
Well, that is a bad guy.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.763
That's the most heroic thing I've done
all year, and it took under two hours.

12:43.846 --> 12:48.559
Well, it's new for you, but for me it's...
just another day, another shithead.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.523
Say I wasn't here
and you had found out what he was doing,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.150
what would you have done?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.818
Asked for more money.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.989
Well, then...
then I would've turned him in.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.574
It's kids, for Christ's sake.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.701
- I'm not a creep.
- Okay.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.288
You want to know if you can rely on me.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.208
I told you, I don't rely on anyone.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.752
Well, good.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.094
Well... time to go collect
more of your hush money.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.765
Yeah, now it's a 50-50 shot
the next guy did the deed.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.229
Yeah?

13:33.312 --> 13:37.441
Sal Blaskowski is a bookie who was
arrested for assault six years ago,

13:37.525 --> 13:38.818
but it didn't stick.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.320
- Who?
<i>- Ask your friend.</i>

13:41.403 --> 13:44.114
<i>Blaskowski's people
threatened him on the phone.</i>

13:44.198 --> 13:45.699
<i>Maybe she sent the stabber.</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:48.202
Jesus. You're a dog with a bone.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.412
It's called tenacity,
and it's a good thing.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.583
Except you're wrong, and we're
closing in on the actual stabber.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.336
Well, she's still dangerous.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.339
<i>Your friend could point us
in her direction.</i>

14:00.422 --> 14:01.632
<i>We should check her out.</i>

14:01.715 --> 14:04.218
I couldn't give less of a shit about her.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.846
Do you hear me?

14:07.596 --> 14:08.681
Loud and clear.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.073
And installation
is that easy and simple.

14:26.657 --> 14:31.161
It looks awkward, but once you
start using it, you won't notice.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.290
Now, down the line,
you'll need a grab bar in every bathroom

14:34.373 --> 14:36.083
and a transfer bench for the tub.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.465
The rugs will have to go.
They're a trip hazard.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.718
All your furniture is too low.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.346
Your best bet is a big La-Z-Boy
in the middle of the room

14:49.430 --> 14:53.100
- with clear paths to the bedroom.
- A La-Z-Boy?

14:53.183 --> 14:57.187
They're not as bad as you think.
My sister has a swanky leather one.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.631
- I'll find out where she got it.
- This is a bit premature.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.234
You asked for home infusions of Radicava.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.945
An hour on that IV
will leave you shaky on your feet,

15:05.029 --> 15:07.114
and you can't risk a fall
in your condition.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.158
I'm gonna be late for work.

15:10.534 --> 15:15.080
It's hard to ask for help,
but you're gonna need someone eventually.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.250
Right now, I need to be left alone.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.338
- Two more minutes to talk bed rails?
- Goodbye.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.491
Hey, you.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.661
I missed you last night.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.665
Mmm.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.125
You taste like...

16:01.126 --> 16:03.128
Rockstar and sadness.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.964
- Were you here all night?
- Yeah.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.885
"Nonprofit governance and fiduciary duty"?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.553
No wonder you look wrecked.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.349
- I'm following a lead for Hogarth.
- Not coming together?

16:15.432 --> 16:17.768
Well, it's together. I just... I'm just...

16:17.851 --> 16:20.020
I'm wondering if I work for the firm
or for Hogarth.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.773
- They're one and the same.
- Not always.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.443
Well, I'd ask if you want
to talk about it, but...

16:26.527 --> 16:29.655
I can't, according to
my ironclad employment contract.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.116
Which I drew up.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.867
You're that good.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.998
Is this gonna be a... problem for us?
Not being able to talk?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.543
I don't know. They say communication
is the key to a good marriage.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.714
We're not married.

16:46.797 --> 16:50.092
- Uh, unless you're planning something?
- I got plans for you, woman.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.136
- Mmm, do you, now?
- Mm-hmm.

16:52.594 --> 16:56.348
Mmm. Okay, I gotta...
I gotta go read a brief.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.518
And you've gotta brush
that situation there.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.353
Talk later?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.437
Yeah.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.132
Yeah, it's all here.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.260
Second mark came through.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.304
Now, we're two-for-two.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.491
I think she's...

17:57.409 --> 17:58.577
over there.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.543
- May I help you?
- You know this guy?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.463
- Should I?
- Strike two.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.466
You got a note demanding cash.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.602
I left the money. What more do you want?

18:24.561 --> 18:28.107
- I want you to admit what you did.
- Okay. I did it.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.401
- Did what?
- You already know, right?

18:31.485 --> 18:34.988
What? Did you poison someone?
You run a puppy mill?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.574
Stop me when I get warm.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.201
You really don't know.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.245
Forget it. Jones, I'm running out of time.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.998
You did something,
or you wouldn't have paid. So spit it out.

18:45.541 --> 18:51.380
I... s skimmed from our petty cash
for my mom's operation.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.465
Then, her funeral.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.553
I had to sell her wedding ring
to pay the blackmail. But that's it.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.054
And no one got hurt.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.932
They can't all be kiddie porn. Let's go.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.521
- It's worse than she says, isn't it?
- I don't know.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.315
Yes, you do.
But you're gonna let it slide.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.439
Because it doesn't matter.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.485
Well, apparently,
it goddamn matters to me.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.929
So Reyna Pincer here has embezzled
millions from your pension accounts.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.851
Unless you want to say goodbye
to your golden years,

19:45.934 --> 19:47.769
I'd suggest you do something about it.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.068
Looks like it matters to them, too.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.530
What is she talking about?

20:21.345 --> 20:22.638
Stop!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.222
Malcolm, stop.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.723
It's me.

20:26.975 --> 20:27.976
Wha...

20:28.060 --> 20:29.353
The surgery worked.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.356
Oh, Jesus.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.235
I can do things now. Good things.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.489
Like breaking and entering?
Stealing confidential files?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.824
- This is not good.
- It is if it helps someone.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.953
Someone has to take on the assholes
that Hogarth defends

20:46.036 --> 20:47.412
before they hurt more people.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.676
This isn't the first time
you've done this.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.833
I might have found
a couple wrongs to right.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.295
- Hogarth would beg to differ.
- Only if you tell her.

20:55.879 --> 20:59.883
I work here. It's my job.
Defending you is not.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.887
Malcolm, telling Hogarth about me
will do more damage than it's worth.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.847
To me and to you.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.891
You're gonna threaten me now?

21:08.809 --> 21:11.603
All I'm saying is you know
I'm on the side of right.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.107
And you know you're not.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.402
- That's a load of crap.
- Is it?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.364
Get out.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.325
Get out before I haul security in here.

21:42.342 --> 21:47.556
Nope. Last mark didn't pay.
I guess I was wrong about him.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.433
He's our guy, and we're gonna go see him.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.729
I got a bookie to pay.
And enough money right now to cover it.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.731
Fine. I'll handle it myself.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.026
Don't you think I've tried it your way?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.069
It doesn't work.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.864
Any time you try
and make something better,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.991
it's 50-50 you'll make it worse.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.744
Lame excuse.
And, trust me, I've tried 'em all.

22:10.370 --> 22:14.791
I know what you want.
Team up and stop all the bad guys.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.264
The hell I do. I don't need you.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.463
Yeah, but you want me...

22:19.546 --> 22:22.382
to tell you who's good
and who's bad, and I can.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.884
No judge or jury necessary.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.636
But you won't,
because you're a chickenshit.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.973
No, because it won't make any difference.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.101
We could spend the rest of our lives
stopping bad guys,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.687
and we would never even make a dent.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.527
Try not to get murdered.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.042
Big date tonight?

22:57.125 --> 23:01.046
A private event, as in,
"She shut the door to ensure privacy."

23:01.129 --> 23:04.174
This is private, too.
I found something on Peter Lyonne.

23:04.841 --> 23:10.722
Had to dig deep. I looked into his past,
his private life, his family.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.975
Even his wife's yearbook. Cute couple.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.480
You want me to destroy Peter
so you can steal his wife.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.649
- That is none of your business.
- Isn't it?

23:21.441 --> 23:26.113
And, by the way, a cheating,
manipulative narcissist like Peter

23:26.196 --> 23:27.906
isn't worthy of your sympathy.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.866
Says she who is without sin, right?

23:31.618 --> 23:34.913
You know what? If I want to be insulted,
I will call Jessica.

23:34.996 --> 23:38.083
I asked you for results, and you failed.

23:39.584 --> 23:43.713
Actually, I found something
that could destroy Peter's marriage

23:43.797 --> 23:46.091
- and send him to jail.
- What is it?

23:47.467 --> 23:49.010
If you're gonna use me as your pimp...

23:49.636 --> 23:51.721
I'd need more than a temp desk
in the file room.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.891
Leveraging my private life against me?

23:56.059 --> 23:57.899
Malcolm, I don't think
I like this side of you.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.105
Neither do I.
Which is why I'm also gonna need

24:00.188 --> 24:02.441
a new employment contract
with some financial incentives.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.817
I just sent you a number.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.203
This firm can't afford that.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.457
Then get a new investigator.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.334
What exactly will I be paying for,
Malcolm?

24:21.418 --> 24:22.669
Agree to the number.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.341
Agreed, but this better be worth it.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.557
Peter has been making withdrawals
from the scholarship fund

24:35.640 --> 24:37.640
that he and Kith set up
in their daughter's memory.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.897
He uses the cash to buy gifts
for his girlfriends.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.192
- Sometimes pays their rent.
- Ooh, this is...

24:45.817 --> 24:48.695
- Worth it.
- Depending on what we do with it.

24:50.822 --> 24:54.075
The information could be distributed
to all of his contacts, including Kith.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.994
But it can't be traced back to us?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.579
No.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.190
We'll be the only ones who'd know
we destroyed a man's life.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.584
Not only his.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.837
What do you want to do?

25:06.713 --> 25:07.713
Nothing...

25:11.092 --> 25:12.427
at the moment.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.926
Debussy has been done to death.

25:53.009 --> 25:56.513
I've seen <i>La Mer</i> so much,
it actually makes me seasick.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.431
What? Should I have
taken you bowling instead?

25:58.515 --> 26:01.393
No, this is fun.
I do love bowling, though.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.311
There's someone that I want you to meet.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.022
- Mathias, is that you?
- Excuse me.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.234
- Jeri, what a lovely surprise.
- Yes, it is.

26:09.859 --> 26:14.573
Good to see you. This is Kith Lyonne.
Kith, this is my client, Mathias Cole.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.536
He is the musical director
for the Philharmonic.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.286
I know who he is.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cole.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.830
- Likewise.
- You two are in the same business.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.582
But not exactly in the same league.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.251
Kith is a cellist.
One of the best that I have ever heard.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.337
Well, my attorney has a discerning ear.
Where do you play?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.464
- I teach, actually.
- She's being modest.

26:31.548 --> 26:35.218
Her quartet is one
of the most sought after in the city.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.252
- Well, I'd love to hear you sometime.
- No, I...

26:38.305 --> 26:39.389
I'll arrange it.

26:40.473 --> 26:44.019
Okay. Well, um, Jeri, lovely to see you.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.478
- It was Ki...
- Kith.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.563
Kith.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.485
- What was that?
- A big break, potentially.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.529
Is that the reason
we came here tonight?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.948
I was doing you a favor.
I don't see what the problem is.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.284
Because you think
of everything as a transaction.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.828
No, I just am trying to make you happy.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.999
Because I am happier
than I have been in a long time.

27:06.082 --> 27:09.461
Don't ruin the best sex I've had in years
by asking for something more.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.881
Peter and I have been
through so much together...

27:13.423 --> 27:14.507
That is why...

27:16.551 --> 27:18.011
you deserve better.

27:18.094 --> 27:21.056
Don't negotiate, Jeri.
This isn't an arbitration.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.266
The Kith that I knew in college...

27:24.726 --> 27:28.355
she talked about being a first chair
in a first-class orchestra.

27:28.438 --> 27:34.069
Composing, conducting. You're...
You're too good for a university quartet.

27:35.278 --> 27:40.533
I'm really not.
And I'm absolutely fine with that.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.702
Are you?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.748
Of course.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.752
I'm not one of your chess pieces, Jeri.
You can't control me.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.635
This is bullshit, Sal.
I came through with the cash!

27:59.177 --> 28:00.762
Three hours late.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.266
How would it look if I let that slide?
Again!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.976
Three weights this time.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.061
Guys...

28:09.479 --> 28:10.689
Give me the 50 pounder.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.194
God damn it. Don't do this!
This'll kill me.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.948
You know it will.
This is just bad for business.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.992
You're gonna lecture me on business?
Please.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.708
- In you go.
- You'll kill me. No!

28:32.335 --> 28:35.255
Boys, this is a teaching moment.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.549
Hey!

28:37.632 --> 28:38.925
Dwayne! My baby!

28:39.676 --> 28:41.136
Who the hell are you, little girl?

29:19.674 --> 29:21.551
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.057
Uh... who are you?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.977
Doesn't matter.
Get out of here. Go.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.607
Did you... Did you fly here or something?
Do you need a ride?

29:36.232 --> 29:37.400
I have a ride.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.591
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorr... I'm so sorry.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.510
Mom! Mom, Jesus!

30:04.135 --> 30:05.136
Hold on.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.629
What are you doing?

30:40.255 --> 30:43.007
Reminding you how to cede control.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.702
What did you think?

31:11.661 --> 31:13.121
Unforgettable.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.332
It's not bowling, but still...

31:34.976 --> 31:36.811
- Ignore it.
- Peter.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.731
Hey, hon.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.235
Um, I left it on the DVR.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.571
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.491
Well, I'm on my way home,
so we'll watch it together.

31:51.826 --> 31:52.827
I love you.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.790
I'm sorry, I have to catch a train.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.792
Thank you for this.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.090
"Clair de lune"
has never been so beautiful.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.563
<i>Third time's a charm...</i>

32:21.564 --> 32:24.442
<i>when you're about to confront
the asshole who stabbed you.</i>

32:25.693 --> 32:27.862
<i>Just want make sure
it's the right asshole.</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.253
<i>He's a shutterbug.</i>

32:44.921 --> 32:46.297
<i>But no selfies.</i>

32:46.381 --> 32:47.840
<i>Likes to watch.</i>

32:50.843 --> 32:52.887
<i>Not exactly light reading.</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:01.729
<i>Lawyer.</i>

33:03.022 --> 33:04.107
<i>Psychologist.</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:06.693
<i>Chemist.</i>

33:09.195 --> 33:11.364
<i>And engineer.</i>

33:11.948 --> 33:14.909
<i>An overachiever, but all over the place.</i>

33:29.757 --> 33:32.010
<i>Athletic and aggressive.</i>

33:40.727 --> 33:46.482
<i>Gregory Sallinger, bachelor,
nonfiction fan, worm enthusiast.</i>

34:10.882 --> 34:14.177
Got you, you stabbing piece of shit.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.594
Hello.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.601
You wanted to meet me.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.108
Sallinger, remember me?

34:29.942 --> 34:33.321
Please, God! You're hurting me.
You're hurting me!

34:35.614 --> 34:36.949
I barely touched you.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.619
Yes, but it makes for excellent visuals.

34:40.203 --> 34:44.623
Hidden security cameras.
This city, you know?

34:44.706 --> 34:49.128
Now I have proof that a powered woman
broke in and molested my person.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.422
And there won't be any plea deal
or anger management this time.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.802
Congratulations, you researched me.

34:56.928 --> 35:02.642
Particle physics requires research.
I figured you out in an afternoon.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.103
Is that why you hurt people?

35:06.854 --> 35:09.148
To make yourself feel powerful?

35:09.690 --> 35:11.901
Or does it take the kill?

35:14.612 --> 35:15.655
I'm curious...

35:16.906 --> 35:19.283
What are you trying to achieve
in this moment?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.245
- A confession.
- To what, exactly?

35:22.328 --> 35:26.082
You already know.
You like knowing the answers.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.626
I have a very disciplined mind.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.796
So ask me the one that you don't know.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.132
Ask me how I found out.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.508
I prefer the mystery.

35:35.591 --> 35:36.843
Bullshit.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.973
Self-importance. Narcissism.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.520
But the cape doesn't fit, does it?

35:48.104 --> 35:50.773
You're doubling down
on your grandiose delusion,

35:50.857 --> 35:54.068
even though you know you are a fraud.

35:58.239 --> 36:02.118
One day... you'll meet your match...

36:03.077 --> 36:04.829
and you'll be exposed.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.915
- You think you're my match?
- Oh, God, no.

36:09.458 --> 36:13.838
I'm so far beyond you,
you look like an ant.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.853
You broke into my apartment.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.521
You broke into mine.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.732
Finally, something that's fair.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.277
I gave you what you wanted.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.406
Now go home and take it,
or you'll find out what I want.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.742
Your own padded cell?

36:42.825 --> 36:44.952
Respect.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.247
Unlike you, I've earned it.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.583
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

36:51.709 --> 36:54.170
Please... Please send help...

36:54.754 --> 36:57.965
Jessica Jones broke into my home,
and she attacked me.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.051
<i>Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way.</i>

37:00.134 --> 37:02.428
Oh, God, please. She's out of control.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.972
I need to file
a restraining order, please.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.766
Oh, God.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.271
<i>Emergency room.</i>

37:53.354 --> 37:56.816
Hi. I... I'm calling about a patient,
Sal Blaskowski.

37:56.899 --> 37:59.277
She was brought
into the emergency room tonight.

38:00.152 --> 38:01.404
<i>You're a family member?</i>

38:02.780 --> 38:04.490
I just need to know if she's okay.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.117
<i>One moment.</i>

38:12.081 --> 38:14.208
<i>Mrs. Blaskowski's condition
has stabilized.</i>

38:14.292 --> 38:16.544
<i>Would you like me
to transfer you to her room?</i>

38:28.431 --> 38:29.432
Erik?

38:33.436 --> 38:34.895
Erik! Erik!

38:36.188 --> 38:38.566
- Jesus.
- Sorry. I dozed off.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.651
It's been a long day.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.236
What are you doing here?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.739
I thought I'd make sure
you had your remaining organs.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.867
You could have called.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.827
My phone fell into a pool.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.663
Sal and I had a disagreement
about punctuality.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.917
You make my life choices look good.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.961
That's impressive.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.315
They were gonna make an example of me,

39:01.380 --> 39:04.759
but then this masked powered chick
showed up.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.927
Saved my ass. I...

39:07.261 --> 39:09.614
They didn't know what hit 'em.
I thought maybe you sent her?

39:09.638 --> 39:11.599
I told you, I don't rely on anyone.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.642
Well, she has your MO,

39:13.726 --> 39:16.020
risking her life for someone
she doesn't even know.

39:25.321 --> 39:30.326
- Somebody break in?
- Your third mark, Gregory Sallinger.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.744
He said he left something.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.788
Well, that can't be good.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.014
Is that... blood?

39:57.186 --> 39:58.354
It's a threat.

39:59.605 --> 40:02.650
Why? He paid us off,
which means that's the end of it.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.918
We're dealing with a murderer.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.338
That explains the massive headache
he gave me.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.966
He thinks we have proof of it.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.346
Which makes us targets.
You need to lay low for a while.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.807
So should you.

40:38.018 --> 40:41.939
Yeah, probably,
but that twisted prick stabbed me

40:42.022 --> 40:44.733
and I can't let him keep doing
whatever sick shit he's doing.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.446
Well, I can.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.116
But I am sorry you have to do this alone.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.966
I know exactly what you need.

41:09.049 --> 41:14.180
A look that doesn't apologize
for who you are or what you want.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.557
<i>But that color is so bold.</i>

41:16.640 --> 41:19.977
And it doesn't show wine stains.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.688
<i>Well, seems like it would draw
a lot of attention.</i>

41:22.771 --> 41:25.065
Exactly. Embrace it.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.902
Let it fill you with confidence.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.613
- That's what pops, right, Grace?
- Exactly.

41:31.155 --> 41:35.075
<i>Oh, what the heck? I'm gonna do it.
Thanks, Trish.</i>

41:35.159 --> 41:36.202
Happy to help.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.746
Let's take another call.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.458
This one is from Jessica
in Hell's Kitchen.

41:44.084 --> 41:45.252
<i>Hi, Trish.</i>

41:46.253 --> 41:49.673
Hi, Jessica.
Are you calling about a sweater?

41:49.757 --> 41:53.344
Yeah. The one that you tried to sell me.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.095
I changed my mind.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.057
<i>I want to buy it.</i>

41:58.724 --> 42:02.686
Okay, great. Well, customer service
is standing by to take your order.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.688
I got this one. Thanks, Grace.

42:05.940 --> 42:10.611
I'm sorry, Jessica. I'm not sure
which sweater you're talking about.

42:11.153 --> 42:14.073
<i>You know damn well
which sweater I'm talking about.</i>

42:14.156 --> 42:17.201
Clingy... smothering...

42:18.118 --> 42:19.620
Sounds like a bad fit.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.705
<i>...and tenacious.</i>

42:22.581 --> 42:27.086
A sweater that won't quit,
even when I ask it to.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.549
Have you tried our cotton blends?

42:32.591 --> 42:34.468
Trish, I need your help.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.804
I'm happy to help.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.932
Thanks for calling.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.609
<i>I don't need a partner.</i>

42:53.195 --> 42:54.780
<i>I need a secret weapon.</i>
