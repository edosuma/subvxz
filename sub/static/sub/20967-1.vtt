01:55.800 --> 02:06.280
♪ Et lux perpetua luceat ei. ♪

02:11.680 --> 02:12.880
At last.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.920
I needed room
for thought to breathe.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.640
My life has been
a lingering for the throne.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.560
Sometimes I must confess I
imagined if my mother happ'ed to die

02:32.560 --> 02:36.640
before her time -
a helicopter crash, a rare disease.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.040
So, at an early age,
I'd be in charge.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.680
Before me, years of constant,
stable rule...

02:49.000 --> 02:52.800
..but I am better thoughtful Prince
than King.

02:55.400 --> 03:00.520
Potential holds appeal,
since in its castle walls

03:00.520 --> 03:05.880
one is protected from
the awful shame of failure.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.560
My wond'rous Charles,
you did her proud,

03:13.560 --> 03:17.760
for, as she would have liked,
you never showed your pain.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.920
My whole existence has,
like most of us,

03:20.920 --> 03:22.800
been built upon the ones
who gave me birth.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.760
And now they're gone. That's it.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.160
First Dad. Now Mum.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.640
I'm alone.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.000
Except for me.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.400
Ah, you're radiant.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.120
'Tis your gift, my dear,
it's what you've brought to us -

03:40.120 --> 03:41.600
a sense of fashion.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.840
Better hair, as well.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.200
I never thought
I'd see her pass away.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.320
I felt the same.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.960
How are you, Dad?
For soon, at last, you will be King.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.400
Not soon. Three months.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.280
Your father rules today.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.160
I thought the coronation
marked the change.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.720
Well, you're right -
officially, that is the case.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.880
But Britain cannot stand without
a king or queen

04:03.880 --> 04:07.440
for all the months it takes to
organise a coronation.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.280
But surely, constitutionally
speaking...

04:09.280 --> 04:13.000
Oh sweet, my dear,
we have no constitution.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.600
Instead tradition holds us
to account.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.480
Tradition, then... Tradition holds
that on the death of kings,

04:18.480 --> 04:22.520
or Queens, the next is monarch
straight away.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.280
Your father ruled the
moment granny passed.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.600
I might head off. If that's OK.

04:29.600 --> 04:30.920
Why?

04:30.920 --> 04:31.960
Headache.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.960
You really have to go?

04:35.960 --> 04:37.880
It's not...

04:37.880 --> 04:38.920
I mean, the whole...

04:40.520 --> 04:43.000
I can't deal with all the chat.
The people.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.800
It's important, Harry.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.640
Yeah - the headache, though.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.000
We'll go and mingle with the crowds.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.840
A single round should be sufficient,
then we're at the palace, yes?

04:56.840 --> 04:59.440
But, Dad, you're shaken up.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.960
Perhaps we should take time to talk?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.360
I'm sorry, it must wait -
James wants us now.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.520
The Prime Minister's waiting.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.200
We'll see you later on.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.680
All right.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.320
Prime Minister.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.400
Sincere condolences upon your loss.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.480
A loss, I think,
that all her subjects share.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.760
Of course. We miss our Queen.

05:23.760 --> 05:28.080
Your Majesty may not recall -
we did decide for public reassurance

05:28.080 --> 05:30.480
that you would leave with
Mr Evans at your side,

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
the Crown and State,
Prime Minister and King.

05:33.040 --> 05:38.440
Ah... Now we're here, I feel
instead that I should remain...

05:38.440 --> 05:42.800
aloft from politics,
and walk with royals alone.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.360
I'm sure Prime Minister
will understand.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.760
Of course.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.680
I'll go right now and...
clear the way.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.440
Such equal billing
was a joy when Prince.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.720
To share the stage
did spread attention out -

06:03.720 --> 06:07.320
but now I'll rise
to how things have to be.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.560
The Queen is dead,

06:10.560 --> 06:12.000
long live the King.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.960
That's me.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.880
MUSIC: Blow Your Mind
by Dua Lipa

06:36.000 --> 06:39.600
Come on, mate,
it's better than moping about, eh?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.880
There's a whole world of
opportunity right there.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.920
Yeah.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.720
'sup, G?

06:46.720 --> 06:48.840
You look like you've been
raped by Primark.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.640
Yeah, I had to blend in.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.120
Thought I'd bag you
a bona fide commoner as a surprise.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.200
She'll be here in a minute.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.280
She's, erm, distinctive.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.640
You should take your mind
off things, you could, er...

07:02.640 --> 07:04.200
Coots! ..do a pleb.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.400
Yeah. Knob a prole.
Look, I'm not in the mood.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.880
Approach a subject
from a different angle, yeah?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.920
Here she is!

07:11.920 --> 07:13.320
Jessica!

07:13.320 --> 07:17.680
You're not joking, then.
Invictus himself!

07:17.680 --> 07:19.160
Er, yeah, look...

07:19.160 --> 07:22.640
So is Charles really your dad?
Or was it the other one?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.000
The other one?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.760
Hewlitt. Hewitt.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.680
Cos you're very ginger.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.080
If you haven't done a test yet,
then maybe you should,

07:30.080 --> 07:31.680
cos if Hewlitt was your dad instead,

07:31.680 --> 07:33.560
you'd be out of the family,
wouldn't you?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.840
Er, what?

07:34.840 --> 07:36.440
Free of it at last.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.520
Free of it?! Dear, oh, dear.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.400
And why - why would I want
to be free of it?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.240
Cos you hate it. Don't you?

07:42.240 --> 07:43.800
No. Not a clue!

07:43.800 --> 07:45.240
He seriously doesn't, darling.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.400
Yeah.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.720
Ever since you left the army, it's
been all schmooze, Africa, sport.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.240
Very worthy but it screams lack of
direction - and clearly,

07:55.240 --> 07:58.400
you hope it'll make you happy.
But it doesn't. Does it?

07:58.400 --> 08:02.200
You're part of this big thing,
but you don't get anything back.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.320
Just the drunken uncle.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.720
It's a trap for you, isn't it?

08:08.520 --> 08:09.640
Your family.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.440
Er, what-what should I do, then?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.280
I think it's time for you
to tap out, darling.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.600
No, no, Coottsey...

08:23.960 --> 08:27.080
Spencer.
Someone wants you at the bar.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.160
Mate, you realise she's probably
a socialist?

08:30.160 --> 08:33.120
No, no. Come on. Not wanted!

08:39.960 --> 08:41.799
So? What-What should I do?

08:43.840 --> 08:45.080
You really want to know?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.560
Shall I be mother?

08:54.560 --> 08:56.320
Thank you, yes, that's kind.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.600
Good then, erm, how shall we begin?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.200
Er, today I thought we might
commence by talking of a bill

09:02.200 --> 09:04.920
about to land upon your desk
that seeks the royal approval.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.280
Yes? What bill do you mean?

09:06.280 --> 09:10.280
To limit future growth
and mass expanse of runways.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.480
What environmental checks...
You must excuse me,

09:12.480 --> 09:13.960
much as this wants our attention,

09:13.960 --> 09:17.840
I had assumed we'd start
with, erm, something else.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.960
Well, of course.
Whichever subject you would like.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.720
Your bill concerning privacy,

09:22.720 --> 09:26.200
which sets restriction
on the freedom of the press.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.360
The regulation of the press
we feel is overdue...

09:31.360 --> 09:32.920
Yes - I've, er, read the bill.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.480
Well, erm...

09:36.480 --> 09:37.680
Good.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.280
You like this law?

09:42.920 --> 09:44.800
I absolutely do.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.920
You yourself must know the lasting
wounds the press inflict.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.960
Unproven accusations,
photographs obtained by theft,

09:51.960 --> 09:54.000
are daily
'splayed as front page news.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.120
You do not think
a principle is here at stake?

09:57.120 --> 10:00.720
There's something vital to our sense
of freedom is being risked.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.800
Your Majesty,

10:01.800 --> 10:04.280
of course I understand that view,
and have myself considered

10:04.280 --> 10:09.080
where the balance lay, but there is
opinion that something must be done.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.160
The law is what your people want.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.000
They want the leaders they elected

10:13.000 --> 10:16.040
standing up and making choices
they themselves cannot.

10:16.040 --> 10:20.640
They pay their taxes well,
so we - or you -

10:20.640 --> 10:26.440
may take the time to study hard and
make the right decision on the day.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.400
I know. I have -

10:28.400 --> 10:29.960
and this is what we think.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.400
I have to say it does surprise

10:37.400 --> 10:39.840
that with the great intrusion
they have made into your life,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.240
you'd have
them left untouched like this.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.960
What of the pack of wolves
that mercilessly did hunt to death

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
your late and much missed wife?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.640
That's bold.
So soon in our relationship.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.040
What's bold?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.080
To utilise Diana.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.880
I'm sorry.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.960
But, in fact, it's rare

11:09.960 --> 11:12.680
to have to justify the passing
of a law like this.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.640
I would have thought of all
the victims,

11:14.640 --> 11:16.960
you'd feel the strongest
something must be done.

11:16.960 --> 11:21.480
As a man, a father, husband,
yes, I do.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.240
But that's not who we are
when sat with you in here.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.080
Not just am I defender of the faith,

11:30.080 --> 11:33.840
but in addition I protect
this country's unique force

11:33.840 --> 11:35.480
and way of life.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.600
Politically our sway and influence
are in decline

11:39.600 --> 11:44.680
but still we demonstrate the way a
just society should work -

11:44.680 --> 11:49.160
judiciary, democracy and more -
a low corruption rate.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.520
All those who hold the strings held
to account themselves in turn.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.680
Your Majesty - thanks.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.520
I understand and say I will,
if opportunity transpires,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.600
make sure I take your views
into account.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.680
Perhaps we should move on
to other things.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.520
It is the law on privacy
that holds concern.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.520
And so I ask you tell me what,
as my Prime Minister, you do intend.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.880
The law is made, and passed.
It is too late.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.760
My views, to you,
mean nothing, then?

12:22.880 --> 12:25.200
Your views mean much,

12:25.200 --> 12:29.600
but on this subject, yes.
I disagree.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.480
The public vote to choose the
members of their parliament,

12:32.480 --> 12:34.440
and that's where decisions
will be made.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.320
Not in this room
between the two of us.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.360
Then our weekly meeting's done.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.040
I should apologise
if I've caused offence -

12:44.040 --> 12:45.800
I simply wanted to explain my view.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.200
And so you have.
We'll meet next week.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.560
You recognise my guest.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.680
Mr Evans.

12:53.960 --> 12:58.040
I reasoned thus - in case there did
arise an accusation

12:58.040 --> 13:00.200
that my vision here
of left and right

13:00.200 --> 13:02.640
was being tilted
out of proper balance,

13:02.640 --> 13:04.640
I will from now on make sure
each week

13:04.640 --> 13:07.800
I have the usual half an
hour with my good Prime Minister,

13:07.800 --> 13:11.400
but then give equal time
for Leader of the Opposition, too.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.240
Mr Evans is a man of principle.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.720
But he does not like me,

13:18.720 --> 13:23.040
and has made explicit that
he will not change a single thing

13:23.040 --> 13:25.240
in light of what I say.

13:25.240 --> 13:29.600
And if this is the case,
then, erm, what am I?

13:31.440 --> 13:35.080
My mother gained respect
from what she'd seen.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.360
The Blitz... She sat with Churchill,

13:38.360 --> 13:41.400
and met all the most important
figures of her years.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.600
But what am I?

13:47.360 --> 13:50.240
It may not be too late
to stop the law.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.640
But when I sign the bill...

13:51.640 --> 13:52.840
If you sign the bill.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.560
For surely that requirement
remains your choice.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.120
A ceremonial right, not one to use.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.320
I hate to differ,
but I think this strikes the heart

14:02.320 --> 14:04.520
of why we have a Queen - or King.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.520
They are the check and
balance of our land.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.120
I've long believed that we could
never see a Nazi party

14:12.120 --> 14:13.200
making British laws

14:13.200 --> 14:16.280
because the reigning monarch
then would stand his ground

14:16.280 --> 14:18.960
and, being head of state,
refuse to sign -

14:18.960 --> 14:21.880
refuse to let the country
lose democracy,

14:21.880 --> 14:24.040
and, doing so, provoke revolt.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.520
It's not our place.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.000
Would do more harm than good.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.360
Then not important.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.240
Write your name in ink,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.720
and un-amended let it into law.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.880
Thank you, er, Mrs Stevens.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.640
Your Majesty.

15:00.120 --> 15:11.920
# I who have died am alive again

15:11.920 --> 15:19.320
# Today

15:19.320 --> 15:27.160
♪ This is the birth day of life

15:30.960 --> 15:34.360
RAP MUSIC PLAYS

16:19.920 --> 16:24.960
Hey, you're lucky -
she doesn't usually put out much.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.440
Oh, yeah, actually we,
we haven't done anything like that,

16:28.440 --> 16:31.160
just went out, had fun, so... Yeah!

16:31.160 --> 16:34.800
All right, too late for tea.
Got a seminar. Right.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.320
Good to meet you.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.880
I'm Robert. Bob. What's your name?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.040
Harry.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.280
Harry. Right. Bye.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.440
Hey!

16:58.440 --> 17:01.400
Erm, I was just...making some tea.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.960
Er, I'll, er, get the milk.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.800
You all right?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.560
Yeah, great. Really great.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.640
God, can you believe it?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.000
What?

17:17.000 --> 17:21.400
Everything we did last night.
Wetherspoons. Bowling.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.800
Dans Le Noir.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.000
The restaurant where you eat
in the pitch black!

17:27.000 --> 17:29.360
They thought I was an estate agent.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.880
THEY LAUGH

17:32.080 --> 17:33.680
This whole life!

17:35.400 --> 17:36.960
I want more.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.520
No-one's stopping you.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.920
A night, yeah,
but I can't do this with my life!

17:40.920 --> 17:41.960
Why not?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.440
It's not what I was born into.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.360
Then change it.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.320
The world you were born into
was paid for

17:54.320 --> 17:56.440
by those people in Wetherspoons.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.680
You take money from their hard work

17:58.680 --> 18:01.160
and you spend it on planes,
and palaces,

18:01.160 --> 18:04.160
and, in your case,
flights to Las Vegas.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.000
It's not your money to spend.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.720
Have you been to Las Vegas?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.040
It looks boring.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.680
Yeah! Yeah, it is, actually.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.000
My mate Dee, she had her baby
in this crap hospital.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.400
Shared ward,

18:17.400 --> 18:20.600
pissed-off midwife, 20 mums.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.560
She puts on the TV,
and what does she see?

18:23.560 --> 18:28.040
Kate, your sister-in-law,
with her perfect baby,

18:28.040 --> 18:29.840
outside her private hospital.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.920
Dee was like,
"I paid for that. My taxes."

18:38.520 --> 18:40.160
You're very beautiful.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.000
Don't patronise me -
listen to what I'm saying. I am -

18:43.000 --> 18:46.080
I know what you're saying,
and I agree with it,

18:46.080 --> 18:50.320
but I'm adding, in addition,
that you're beautiful, as well.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.360
You know Bob wants nothing less
than the abolition of the monarchy.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.560
Yeah, well, he should be more
open minded.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.000
Well, imagine what he'd say
if I got off with you.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.600
Do you want to?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.160
What? Get off with me?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.920
Harry, I hate everything
you stand for.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.120
Yeah, I know.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.320
Right, then.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.640
Yeah. It's, it's just, you really
look like you want to kiss me.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.240
Yeah, well, I don't.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.320
This is a mistake.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.640
KNOCKING AT DOOR

19:49.760 --> 19:51.120
Forgot his keys, probably.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.040
Wait, wait!

20:02.600 --> 20:04.000
Yes?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.040
Your Highness.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.600
Oh.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.200
Apologies for interrupting.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.960
James Cadbury Reiss,
press advisor to the palace. May I?

20:19.840 --> 20:21.600
This is Jessica.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.000
Hi. Charmed.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.640
Your Highness.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.400
Your grandmother,
the Queen, recently passed away.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.240
The country's in a position very
few people have experienced before.

20:32.240 --> 20:36.680
This is perhaps the most unstable
moment the royal family will face.

20:36.680 --> 20:41.000
So...? So, perhaps a conversation
should be had about...

20:42.480 --> 20:43.680
..timing.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.640
Your security are waiting outside.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.680
Goodbye.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.320
SHE SCOFFS

20:53.520 --> 20:54.680
Wow.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.680
That, there, is why I'm never
getting off with you again.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.800
Yeah.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.400
I understand.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.800
SHE SIGHS

21:19.040 --> 21:20.480
KEYS RATTLE

21:26.200 --> 21:27.240
Can I call you?

21:28.360 --> 21:29.680
Yeah.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.160
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

21:52.000 --> 21:53.960
It's good of you to come
and see us here.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.880
It's so important
that we meet like this.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.440
Especially now.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.240
That as a family we have
this time to talk.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.720
Excuse me.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.760
DOOR CLOSES

22:25.760 --> 22:28.320
When offered what he's wanted for
so long,

22:28.320 --> 22:32.640
I thought Dad would seize the moment
and renew, to go greet the people.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.720
Instead, he stays inside,
just reading books and bills.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.920
It isn't what I'd hoped.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.440
Then why not talk to him?

22:41.280 --> 22:42.800
Oh, Lord.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.240
Oh...you're William and Kate.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.560
They said I was to wait here
and soon the King would join.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.480
They didn't mention you were settled
here, as well. I'll, erm...

22:50.480 --> 22:52.920
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
I'll quickly go sit elsewhere.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.280
But, sir - you look so pale,
distraught, you must sit down.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.120
I'd rather that
than have you faint.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.360
You're kind to me.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.600
So sudden? What's the cause?

23:01.600 --> 23:04.160
You will forgive me if I do not give
detail of my conference.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.240
It is a matter of some...delicacy.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.920
But if it causes such distress...?

23:07.920 --> 23:11.320
Of course, we understand,
and will not press on you.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.840
Perhaps some water?

23:12.840 --> 23:14.160
Thanks.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.720
Must be something virulent
indeed that does affect

23:20.720 --> 23:22.520
the King as strongly
as Prime Minister.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.680
Perhaps it is an illness
passing round?

23:26.680 --> 23:28.120
No illness, Duchess, no,

23:28.120 --> 23:30.680
a matter that need only trouble
him and I for now.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.080
Please tell me what.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.680
Perhaps I might...

23:35.680 --> 23:39.080
relieve the
harshness of this mystery sore.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.080
In reading here,
you mustn't tell a soul

23:45.080 --> 23:47.360
what's written -
or not written - by the King.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.800
Dear Mr Evans, water,

23:50.800 --> 23:53.720
fetched and got by careful hand
of Prince of Wales.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.080
Thank you.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.840
But, Kate, what on that paper
makes that look

23:59.840 --> 24:02.360
which from experience
I know tends doom and fury

24:02.360 --> 24:04.560
from your normally
soft and poised face?

24:10.280 --> 24:11.640
I take it this is not a fake?

24:11.640 --> 24:14.480
It's not...for Charles
has marked it there himself,

24:14.480 --> 24:17.960
and I as people's leader
come to say this will not stand.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.040
He must allow this bill to pass,
both signed and unamended.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.280
But, William,
why would your father interfere

24:27.280 --> 24:29.040
so crassly in the affairs of state?

24:30.120 --> 24:31.680
My husband, what say you?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.320
Nothing.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.400
Say more,
for nothing comes of nothing said.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.320
My father's King.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.040
He may have reason that we do not
know or understand, as yet -

24:41.040 --> 24:44.760
but we, as son and daughter of
the Crown, will only give support,

24:44.760 --> 24:47.800
and leave dispute to those who have
a stake in what is being argued on.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.880
Well, you have a stake.
Much more than most.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.080
We will depart,
allowing you to talk.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.600
The opposition with me agreed

24:55.600 --> 24:57.560
that, even though they did not
want this bill,

24:57.560 --> 24:58.720
and would not have it law...

24:58.720 --> 25:00.480
You've talked to Mrs Stevens?

25:00.480 --> 25:01.880
What said she?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.280
The same.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.120
That you must sign.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.560
HE EXHALES

25:10.080 --> 25:13.000
But of course she said I must.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.280
Your Majesty, have you thought what
people will, when hearing that

25:16.280 --> 25:18.520
you have reserved assent,
be wont to do?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.440
Division would result.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.040
I beg you, sir, let's talk some more
as months and years go on, but...

25:27.040 --> 25:28.160
here it is.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.920
Perhaps you could just get your pen
and sign the bill.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.600
You have not changed a word?

25:55.600 --> 25:56.840
It is the same.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.080
Were there solution evident
that could enable both of us

26:11.080 --> 26:13.920
to have our way and...
take it in an instant.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.040
For I know you're acting
out of conscience.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.440
That's right, and in good conscience
I have thought

26:20.440 --> 26:23.520
that, come the moment,
surely I could sign.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.160
But when the pen
approaches paper thus,

26:28.160 --> 26:31.440
about to store forever my assent,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.560
the pen dries up.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.600
My hand, it cannot write.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.360
For if my name is given
through routine,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.320
and not because it represents
my view,

26:43.320 --> 26:45.480
then soon I'll have no name,

26:45.480 --> 26:46.800
and nameless, I...

26:48.320 --> 26:50.200
..have not myself.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.880
This is your role.
You surely must have...

26:52.880 --> 26:54.440
Not since the news was born

26:54.440 --> 26:58.720
has Government and State been there
allowed to use the threat of jail

26:58.720 --> 27:02.480
to stop the presses based on
what THEY deem is unacceptable.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.880
The Queen did not,
in all her years bethroned,

27:04.880 --> 27:06.480
face laws like this to pass.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.520
I do agree. For, in her time,
she faced far greater revolution.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.760
When she lost an empire.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.320
She oversaw the alteration from
the unions, mines and factories

27:17.320 --> 27:19.440
that stood for generations,

27:19.440 --> 27:21.760
to a world that, Thatcherated,

27:21.760 --> 27:25.280
Reaganised, did place the profit
higher value than the pride

27:25.280 --> 27:27.600
belonging to the man who travels,
day by day,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.040
upon the Clapham omnibus.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.680
And through all this,
when laws arrived from those

27:32.680 --> 27:34.240
prime ministers she hated,

27:34.240 --> 27:37.320
doing things of which I'm sure she
never would approve,

27:37.320 --> 27:39.800
she still did sign.
Respected all the votes

27:39.800 --> 27:43.080
empowering those elect
to make the law. She always signed.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.920
She always gave assent.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.240
Well...

28:11.720 --> 28:13.080
..I cannot.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.720
I'm sorry, sir, but if I leave this
room without "King Charles"

28:24.720 --> 28:26.920
imprinted there below,
I cannot keep it secret.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.040
And in addition, I'll ensure
this bill becomes the law

28:31.040 --> 28:32.760
without your royal assent.

28:32.760 --> 28:35.240
Redraft the law with changes

28:35.240 --> 28:39.920
that defend the independence
of the press and send it back,

28:39.920 --> 28:42.040
and I will sign immediately.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.080
Your Majesty...

28:48.080 --> 28:49.280
no.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.960
You are sure that this is what
you want to do?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.680
Without my voice and spirit,

29:12.680 --> 29:14.080
I am dust.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.920
This is not what I want...

29:22.280 --> 29:24.000
..but what I must.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.520
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

29:43.320 --> 29:45.680
With the bill concerning privacy

29:45.680 --> 29:48.240
and the statutory
regulation of the press,

29:48.240 --> 29:51.920
the King has unexpectedly
refused to grant assent.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.080
And despite his knowledge that the
royal assent is ceremonial

29:55.080 --> 29:58.640
and not a tool, he has continued
to withhold his pen.

29:58.640 --> 30:02.000
So, here I say, importantly,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.040
that first we must defend
democracy itself.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.440
I am speaking from the palace
to you all...

30:11.440 --> 30:12.560
reluctantly.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.280
I had a hope my ministers
and I could find a way

30:17.280 --> 30:21.200
to circumvent
a public feud like this.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.520
But, driven by my conscience,

30:23.520 --> 30:27.000
I have declined to pass
a law that would give Government

30:27.000 --> 30:29.400
the right and power to restrict

30:29.400 --> 30:32.600
what is acceptable to say in print.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.400
Once fragile politicians can,

30:36.400 --> 30:39.520
whilst claiming public sensitivity,

30:39.520 --> 30:42.560
go censoring what is writ or not,

30:42.560 --> 30:45.960
it will be easier
to govern as corrupt

30:45.960 --> 30:49.360
than bother being held unto account.

30:49.360 --> 30:53.800
And therefore I, who stand
outside the rough and tumble

30:53.800 --> 30:57.280
of expedience, do caution...

30:57.280 --> 30:58.920
and ask they think again.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.800
So far, they have refused.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.040
..weight, influence to the shaping
of the Government. MPS: Hear, hear.

31:06.040 --> 31:10.680
So now do I, as King and...

31:10.680 --> 31:12.960
servant to the populace...

31:14.920 --> 31:18.520
..request your understanding
and your trust

31:18.520 --> 31:22.680
that this,
a rare but necessary act,

31:22.680 --> 31:25.560
is not me stepping too far
from the throne,

31:25.560 --> 31:30.080
but is my duty, and fulfilling
what the king or queen

31:30.080 --> 31:32.040
is sworn by oath to do.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.800
You're late.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.000
Well, if you'd seen the news,
perhaps you'd realised

31:43.000 --> 31:44.160
I've been rather busy.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.080
So, what's wrong?

31:49.080 --> 31:52.600
Increasingly, there's stories
in the papers about me and Harry.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.280
I suppose they think
that I'm a quite unusual match

31:55.280 --> 31:56.440
because of class.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.800
Yes, well, that's hardly a surprise.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.000
Three years ago,
I knew a boy called Fin,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.400
who was a dick, if truth be told.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.760
But because we lived in different
cities, did text our love.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.560
I'm guessing where this goes.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.480
One day, when I was in the mood,
I had composed a text

32:14.480 --> 32:17.720
expressing love and stuff,
which then I sent...

32:18.720 --> 32:21.560
..but now he contacts
me again and makes a threat.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.880
He threatens you
with one small text?

32:23.880 --> 32:27.200
Yeah, well, in truth,
it did contain additional form.

32:27.200 --> 32:31.720
You mean...? Some pictures of myself
that were artistic, yeah?

32:31.720 --> 32:33.960
His e-mail said he'd seen the news,

32:33.960 --> 32:37.400
and since I was so clearly
after gold, he should have his.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.440
He said if I do not pay up,

32:40.440 --> 32:42.880
he'd send the photo to
the Sun on Sunday.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.560
It's blackmail,
so you could approach police -

32:46.560 --> 32:48.800
but they, I warn you,
leak like carrier bags,

32:48.800 --> 32:51.680
and have no love for
matters Royal these days.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.800
If truly you wish to save
the Prince,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.840
perhaps you need to leave his side,

32:55.840 --> 32:58.520
and so doing take from this man
the power he now has.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.120
If this was Harry or
the King, you would do something.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.320
You don't understand, miss,
you are not part of the family.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.680
MOBILE BUZZES

33:08.680 --> 33:09.800
HE SCOFFS

33:10.960 --> 33:12.840
Of all the moments
you could pick.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.040
Opinion polls suggest the people
are divided almost equally

33:41.040 --> 33:44.640
as to if my non-signing
is within my rights...

33:45.760 --> 33:47.760
..or not.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.240
But that half's far more
than I expected

33:50.240 --> 33:52.040
would agree with me on this.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.080
Whatever many like to think,

33:56.080 --> 33:59.120
there is a wise and ancient bond

33:59.120 --> 34:01.920
between the Crown and population

34:01.920 --> 34:03.880
of this pleasant isle.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.920
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

34:09.320 --> 34:12.520
Charles, you have a visitor.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.560
Oh, not Mr Evans? No, I'm tired.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.920
It's Mrs Stevens.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.920
I see.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.199
Be careful.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.880
I do not trust her well.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.960
DOOR CLOSES

34:30.960 --> 34:34.679
Your Majesty,
please forgive how late it is.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.120
I was not keen to draw attention

34:36.120 --> 34:38.199
to the fact that we had
a conference tonight.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.679
I'm sure you weren't,

34:39.679 --> 34:42.480
since vocally you've been
most critical of what I've done,

34:42.480 --> 34:46.600
despite a week before assuring
me of your complete support.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.520
Forgive me, but all I think I did

34:48.520 --> 34:51.440
was draw attention
to your rights as King.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.520
A politician's tongue
you have indeed.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.520
It's late. I'm tired.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.960
Cut to the chase.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.240
Tomorrow, Mr Evans' bill is read

35:04.240 --> 35:06.280
that makes it clear
a law cannot be halted

35:06.280 --> 35:08.440
waiting for the King's assent.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.200
This bill will pass,
and when it does,

35:11.200 --> 35:14.280
the Crown will lose the right to
speak forever more.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.760
So I had wondered
what Your Majesty did plan

35:16.760 --> 35:19.040
to fix this far erroneous course.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.680
Because, you see,
the vote's tomorrow -

35:21.680 --> 35:23.880
and I for one would not be happy

35:23.880 --> 35:26.960
that the influence
our monarch has is changed.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.440
Therefore, you think the better
evil is take pen and sign

35:29.440 --> 35:32.320
the wretched and corrupted bill?

35:32.320 --> 35:35.880
It is not up to me to tell the
King what he has privilege to do,

35:35.880 --> 35:37.800
but if he needed inspiration,

35:37.800 --> 35:39.720
he could mull how William IV

35:39.720 --> 35:42.040
resolved a not entirely
different situation.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.200
William IV?

35:50.960 --> 35:53.440
I just suggest you might research
the past.

So like our mother's voice.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
It freaked me out.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
I've checked,
there's nothing going on.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.080
Well, that's the story of my life.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.560
Once woke, I lay and thought,
"I've had enough."

37:55.200 --> 37:58.920
This appointed house we share
is yours, not mine.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.280

38:01.280 --> 38:03.200
Even if our father's making waves,

38:03.200 --> 38:06.080
at least he's allowed to choose
his course, but I just...

38:06.080 --> 38:09.640
chase your wake, a ginger joke,
bereft of value.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.280
The way our father acts,
the joke may be on all of us.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.360
But then, I saw my phone
and found that Jess had sent a text

38:16.360 --> 38:18.800
which said she thought
that it would never work.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.200
She would embarrass me.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.440
From what I've read, I thought this
Jessica did cheer your mood?

38:25.440 --> 38:27.360
The two of you had fun?

38:27.360 --> 38:30.400
We have, she does -
and not just fun.

38:34.040 --> 38:38.560
We have done things
that most do every day but...

38:38.560 --> 38:41.320
I assumed were
not within my compass Royal.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.240
She has unblinkered me,

38:45.240 --> 38:46.720
and op'ed my eyes.

38:48.480 --> 38:52.440
The world is wider now,
more depth and shape, but...

38:52.440 --> 38:54.840
with this new perspective,

38:54.840 --> 38:57.320
I do only seem more trapped...

38:57.320 --> 38:58.800
by this, the family.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.160
There will be girls to come,
there've always been before.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.720

39:02.720 --> 39:05.640
And if our father's crisis black
does shadow more,

39:05.640 --> 39:08.400
I hope that I can turn,
as I've always done, to you.

I am as much the Queen

A scream? What scream?

40:37.280 --> 40:40.960
Good Mr Evans, what a kindness shown
to come at such an early hour thus.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.400
I fear my family does cause
you pains.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.880
My lady, I cannot pretend that, yes,

40:44.880 --> 40:49.040
my life would be a joy in recent
weeks if Britain was republic.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.920
Today, you still intend
to call together

40:51.920 --> 40:53.160
all the members of the House,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.640
and then propose exclusion
of the Crown from making law?

40:55.640 --> 40:58.320
I do. Ideally, I'd preserve
the role of the Crown.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.680
But as things stand,
I haven't got a choice.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.160
Would you consider
waiting for a week,

41:03.160 --> 41:05.080
and giving time to let
my father change?

41:05.080 --> 41:07.200
Already, we have waited,
and he changes not.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.720
What if William went at earliest
hour to see his father?

41:09.720 --> 41:12.600
Kate, I can't. What time's the vote?

41:12.600 --> 41:14.640
It's 11 o'clock.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.400
I wonder if Prime Minister
might have one more attempt?

41:17.400 --> 41:20.320
See, I cannot think that if
my father truly understood...

41:20.320 --> 41:23.040
He comprehends it well.
He will not sign.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.600
I have no choice.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.680
My nervous future King,

41:28.680 --> 41:30.640
it's not just him or you you risk

41:30.640 --> 41:32.640
by sitting here
and doing nothing thus -

41:32.640 --> 41:35.160
it is our children, and their
children hence,

41:35.160 --> 41:38.120
and after that all generations Royal
that are to come.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.520
They all do look to you,
insisting you defend the Crown

41:41.520 --> 41:43.240
against this fool's indulgence.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.440
It wouldn't change a thing.
He is too proud.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.600
Then think not only
of persuading him,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.400
but finding lever so he must agree.
What lever?

41:52.400 --> 41:55.120
The fact that both of us
command support

41:55.120 --> 41:57.960
that near thrice outweigh
the aged King...

41:57.960 --> 42:01.400
and if we wanted might begin to itch
in waiting for the Throne.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.600

Why do you want to quit, then?

45:18.600 --> 45:20.160
I think I'm in love.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.120
Hmm, pretty girl?

45:28.120 --> 45:29.360
Yeah.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.800
You going to run off with her?

45:31.920 --> 45:33.120
Maybe.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.120
Found that money yet?

45:41.240 --> 45:44.680
Yeah, sorry.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.920
Out of date now, innit?

45:52.360 --> 45:56.640
You know, since she died,
world's gone mad, I swear.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.360
Every night, people have this look.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.360
Bit like you.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.400
And it's like they're terrified.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.680
They don't know where they live.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.960
They don't know what Britain is.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.480
What do you mean?

46:17.160 --> 46:18.800
Like this meat here.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.760
It's not one thing.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.320
Different pieces, different slices,

46:24.320 --> 46:27.600
collected around
one core piece of steel.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.880
But you take that away,
it all falls apart.

46:32.960 --> 46:36.680
Maybe she is
what held it all together.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.520
Where's this girl of yours, then?

46:44.120 --> 46:45.600
She left me.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.240
Do you love her?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.600
Yeah.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.480
Yeah, I think I do.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.760
Find her.

47:29.040 --> 47:32.040
MRS STEVENS:
'I thank you, Mr Speaker,

47:32.040 --> 47:35.040
'and because we know the facts
upon the matter well,

47:35.040 --> 47:37.040
'I will unusually be very brief.'

47:37.040 --> 47:39.280
LAUGHTER

47:39.280 --> 47:44.280

a man or woman and the State...'

must there agree,

'that citizen does have a voice

47:51.760 --> 47:56.480
'And so an intervention such as
this which so removes the voice,

47:56.480 --> 47:59.680
'but keeps the law
is absolutely wrong...'

47:59.680 --> 48:00.960
'Hear, hear!'

48:03.680 --> 48:05.320
Not at the table.

will vote in favour of this bill.

'constituents to have their say

48:26.680 --> 48:29.600
'and give their weight

48:29.600 --> 48:31.000
Where is he?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.040
He's upstairs.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.000
He'll be down shortly.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.160
Upstairs?!

48:36.160 --> 48:38.440
Roberts said he
was not to be disturbed.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.840
'..and now he oversteps...'

48:43.800 --> 48:45.880
So we must act.

48:45.880 --> 48:49.600
And not out of disrespect,
but since we have no other choice

48:49.600 --> 48:53.720
than to protect our democratic,
British, way of life.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.880
ALL: Hear, hear!

48:56.880 --> 49:00.840
And now by ancient process,
on this most important matter,

49:00.840 --> 49:02.760
we'll divide the House.

49:02.760 --> 49:05.240
THREE LOUD KNOCKS

49:13.360 --> 49:16.400
We will divide the House and vote.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.960
Ayes to the left...

49:17.960 --> 49:20.760
FOUR LOUD KNOCKS

as King of England, Northern
Ireland, Wales and Scotland,

49:57.720 --> 50:03.320
use my Royal prerogative here to

50:23.440 --> 50:26.760
This noise demeans you all.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.480
Is this the space where public
will is spoke and heard,

50:30.480 --> 50:33.800
or just a stand for
juvenile and selfish squall?

50:33.800 --> 50:36.720
Through petty theft, and fighting
here amongst yourselves,

50:36.720 --> 50:38.680
you've lost the population's trust.

50:38.680 --> 50:41.160
I am not prone to certainty,

50:41.160 --> 50:45.960
but you have drawn that measure
in my unsure heart.

50:47.600 --> 50:49.400
Unlike you all,

50:49.400 --> 50:52.320
I'm born and raised to rule.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.080
I do not choose,

50:56.080 --> 50:58.400
but like an Albion Oak,

50:58.400 --> 51:00.920
I'm sown in British soil,

51:00.920 --> 51:03.960
and grown, not for myself,

51:03.960 --> 51:06.320
but reared
with single purpose meant.

51:06.320 --> 51:09.880
Whilst you have small constituency
support which gusts and falls

51:09.880 --> 51:15.240
as does the wind, my cells and
organs constitute this land...

51:16.400 --> 51:19.320
The speaker knows
it is within my right,

51:19.320 --> 51:22.680
to sack my ministers
and call a fresh election.

51:31.680 --> 51:35.240

is well within my right

51:35.240 --> 51:40.840
and anointed power to,
as King, demand?

51:43.840 --> 51:48.000
Your Majesty,
if this is what you want,

51:48.000 --> 51:51.880
then this you can, as King, command.

Bob, I'm sorry to wake you.
I-I know it's late.

53:50.680 --> 53:52.440
Did you got her text?

53:52.440 --> 53:54.080
Yeah, I've been trying to call.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.840
Your Highness? Yeah?

53:55.840 --> 53:57.520
Fuck off.

54:06.800 --> 54:11.240
CROWD NOISE AND HUBBUB

54:28.920 --> 54:30.560
I had to find you.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.920
You can't be out here on your own,
you'll be lynched.

54:32.920 --> 54:34.440
I'm not on my own. Terry?

54:34.440 --> 54:35.840
Yes, sir.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.160
That's how I found you.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.040
What do you want? Jess, I...

54:39.040 --> 54:41.760
I want to say, I...I love you.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.680
What?

54:54.920 --> 54:56.320
Jess!

54:56.320 --> 54:58.520
They're just using this
to get at my father.

54:58.520 --> 55:01.520
Well, I don't want anything to do
with any of it. Or you. We're done.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.920
Yeah, but I know you like me.

55:02.920 --> 55:05.840
Mate, it doesn't matter.
You're a prince.

55:06.840 --> 55:08.080
You always will be.

55:11.560 --> 55:15.040
Come to the palace.
There's a way this can work.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.560
Please!

55:17.920 --> 55:19.400
Ohh!

55:27.320 --> 55:29.400
HELICOPTER WHIRS

55:37.360 --> 55:39.000
The crowds!

55:39.000 --> 55:40.240
You hear?

55:40.240 --> 55:42.360
How many guards
are standing there outside?

55:42.360 --> 55:43.880
Please, have them tripled.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.840
Your Majesty, these men in front
are there for tourist ceremony,

55:46.840 --> 55:48.200
not defence.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.280
If it's your safety that concerns...

55:50.280 --> 55:55.000
It's my preservation - and I know
that will be served by what is seen.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.080
The truth is
that my greatest enemies

55:57.080 --> 56:01.040
stand not within the crowd outside,
but there, in Whitehall,

56:01.040 --> 56:03.840
waiting for the slightest
glimpse of weakness.

56:05.560 --> 56:09.240
Sir Matthew, when timely pressed,

56:09.240 --> 56:14.840
you'll need to know precisely where,
to whom, your loyalty lies.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.960
My loyalty?

56:17.960 --> 56:21.840
Your Majesty, when we join
the forces we all swear

56:21.840 --> 56:26.720
that, come what may, we shall
protect the King, and so we will.

56:31.920 --> 56:34.880
SHOUTING

57:02.720 --> 57:04.320
You're looking at me.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.680
Aren't you?

57:09.920 --> 57:11.520
All the time.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.600
You think you know me?

57:20.880 --> 57:22.280
Well, I know nothing.

57:24.320 --> 57:26.000
Just a plastic doll,

57:26.000 --> 57:27.800
designed, I'm told,

57:27.800 --> 57:31.880
to stand embodying a male-created
bland and standard wife,

57:31.880 --> 57:34.760
whose only job
is prettying the Prince,

57:34.760 --> 57:38.520
and then, if possible, get pregnant
with the royal and noble bump,

57:38.520 --> 57:40.240
to there produce an heir...

57:41.600 --> 57:43.080
..and spare.

57:44.520 --> 57:48.560
But, being underestimated so

57:48.560 --> 57:51.960
does mean I can observe and plan
and learn the way to rule.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.480
Of course I understand, Dad,
but this goes way beyond...

57:54.480 --> 57:58.320
For I will be a queen
unlike the ones before.

57:59.760 --> 58:02.600
My mother's dad was
in the North a miner born,

58:02.600 --> 58:04.560
my father came from Leeds,

58:04.560 --> 58:07.800
both of them when young and
inexperienced did risk their house

58:07.800 --> 58:11.320
and all they had to try
and make a business of their own.

58:13.280 --> 58:16.880
But it's not just this stock I bring
to these most distant regal realms,

58:16.880 --> 58:19.280
but something more
important and precise.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.440
I have ambition for my husband, yes,

58:23.440 --> 58:28.120
and I hope my son
will grow the finest King -

58:28.120 --> 58:34.160
but if I must put up with taunts,
and make so public everything I am,

58:34.160 --> 58:36.560
then I demand things for myself.

58:38.320 --> 58:43.640
I ask no less than power
to achieve my will

58:43.640 --> 58:47.960
in fair exchange
for total service to the State.

58:47.960 --> 58:51.000
Yes, this is what, enthroned,
that I will do.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.920
Not simply help my husband in his
crown, but wear one of my own.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.240
How did it go?

59:03.240 --> 59:06.040
He simply said the strength
of public voice in strong support

59:06.040 --> 59:08.640
did give him solace
that he wasn't wrong.

59:08.640 --> 59:11.120
This is answer clear enough to me.
He's stranded.

59:12.680 --> 59:14.280
So, what's your plan?

59:15.640 --> 59:17.680
Your Highness? The Prime Minister.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.160
The Prime Minister?

59:19.160 --> 59:21.000
I didn't ask him here. I know.

59:24.200 --> 59:28.200
Prime Minister.
Please tell us latest news.

59:28.200 --> 59:30.840
Last night saw violence
across the country.

59:30.840 --> 59:32.520
In Liverpool, in Oxford,

59:32.520 --> 59:34.160
Edinburgh, in Belfast too.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.640
But London is the worst.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.480
Prime Minister, I've seen what's
going on. And Parliament?

59:38.480 --> 59:41.280
There is no Parliament.
The speaker will not open the House

59:41.280 --> 59:43.240
for he fears it is illegal
as things stand.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.880
So the members of Parliament do sit,

59:44.880 --> 59:47.200
just as 400 years ago,
in Westminster Hall instead.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.880
Services are functioning well -
schools, transport, health?

59:49.880 --> 59:52.120
No, the schools are closed,
doctors are stretched.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.000
The bloodshed worsens every day
we wait,

59:54.000 --> 59:55.920
and while we in the House
attempt to calm,

59:55.920 --> 59:58.080
the King parks a tank
in Buckingham Palace grounds.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.160
Prime Minister, in private,
I, of course,

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.400
whole-heartedly do give my support,
but this is for Parliament to solve.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.200
William, they can't!

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.320
Parliament is impotent.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.520
The time has come to go
and halt this mess.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.800
Your Highness, you are the only way.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.280
And what am I to do?
You know full well. I can't.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.000
Then, sir, I think you will be
Prince no more.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.920
For none that follow
will be King again.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.160
George.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.000
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
George, come back inside, please.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.840
I'm so sorry! He just ran away.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.880
Go back inside, OK?
Mummy and I are talking.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.880
Prime Minister,
go back to Number 10.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.120
You can leave this to me.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.880
I will bring an end to this
unnecessary episode.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.920
I thank you, sir.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.040
For reasons
you don't need to understand,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.560
a picture made of Jessica
that is quite intimate

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.000
has made its way into the pages
of a national paper.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.520
There is attack towards her worse
than I have seen

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.400
against Kate, or me, or Mum,
or you...

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.680
and now she wants to leave me,
cos of this.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.600
If I defend the freedom of the
press, it's with the knowledge they

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.200
will never live up
to a higher standard.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.000
Naked girls, young boys
will illustrate their pages,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.080
and they'll make hypocrisy an art,

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.600
insisting that they stand
chief moralist

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.080
while making cash
as base pornographer.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.600
I know this much.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.320
So, all that we can do...

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.000
..is stand our ground.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.040
For, if they're free to
print this dirt,

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.280
then we have liberty,
as well, to answer back.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.640
So now you have my word,

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.280
you have the royal protection
and respect.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.320
Whatever we can do to help, we will.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.600
You will be welcome in our family.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.840
Wait, no, that isn't that we want.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.680
Come, Harry, now it's done.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.240
I do not want her
noble princess made.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.760
Instead descend myself
into the mass,

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.080
cast off the princely burden
of my birth

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.640
and for my life be Harry,
man and friend,

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.360
with job, and house

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360
and car and maybe wife.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.040
It isn't possible.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.240
We make no fuss
'cept that I've moved, found work.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.560
I'll have
no role official and not prince,

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.680
I'll live a life of normalcy,
within this country,

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.040
rather than atop the mound, unearned
and with a target on my back.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.400
You would not be a prince?!

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.880
I'd be...your son,

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.040
but, no - my love
for Jessica comes first.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.680
Because like you,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.120
I don't believe that born a prince
must mean I sacrifice my soul.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.840
Dissimilarity, it seems,
does make a match.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.360
So, Harry...

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.400
..yes.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.720
You may do as you wish.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.240
Sir, whatever you may do,

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.440
this story is distraction when the
Crown itself is in dispute.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.720
The people need to hear from you.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.120
As we discussed,
despite your reservations,

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.720
you must now go and meet the press.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.200
Excuse me.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.760
OK?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.920
OK.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.360
DOOR CLOSES

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.080
William!
I didn't know you would be here.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.720
We'll always serve the
interests of the Crown.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.080
As family, we should be seen as one.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.120
James says it's what they will
expect of us.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.160
It was James persuaded you to come?

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.400
It was in conversation, yes.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.600
I don't know how to thank you,
James.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.280
It will be now with pride and
strength of clan

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.400
I stand my ground and state my case.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.880
As always, James,
you've thought of everything.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.640
The picture here like this
is now complete.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.640
The family will be my backdrop
and the news will say,

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.640
the country's safe,
and clear united.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.640
Ah, no photos yet, please.
Good morning.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.680
As you know, we've only got
about 20 minutes.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.040
So, erm,
His Highness will say a few words.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.640
Then we can do some set-ups
afterwards. Thank you.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.360
Good afternoon.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.520
Gosh, there's quite a few of you -

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.600
but thank you all for coming
here today.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.320
My wife and I have been so shocked

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.440
by scenes unfolding
here and overseas.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.600
My father has,
through noble conscience said,

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.640
as is his right, he will withhold
assent -

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.160
and furthermore, as is legal, too,
he has dismissed elected government.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.760
Of course, this has resulted
in disquiet.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.480
Not just in homes

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.400
and streets, or in the House,

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.720
but in our family, too.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.760
My wife and I respect my
father's choices,

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.720
but do wish this could have
been avoided,

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.360
and so, today, I do announce
that I, as Prince Of Wales,

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:24.120
from now will try to mediate between
the King and the House of Commons.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.880
I am convinced there is
a way to move on this,

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.040
without the need for further
violence,

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.960
and respecting both democracy

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.480
and the ancient British power
of anointed King.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.560
I have my father's
blessing in this role.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.080
He is as keen as I am to see an end

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.480
to this destructive
and divisive time.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.840
I'm also lucky to have
Catherine, too.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.200
For all of this was
actually her idea.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.200
Turns out she's cleverer than
all of us. She'll sort us out.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.200
CAMERAS CLICK AND PRESS SHOUT

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080
Your Majesty, sir,
I want to explain.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.200
You knew what William
would say to them?!

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.760
Indeed. I made it possible
for him to speak.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.160
You're surely not intending
still to work for me,

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.600
not after treachery like this?

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.720
Your son has offered me employment.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.600
I hope you fail
in everything you do!

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.680
Prime Minister.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.280
SHOUTING AND JEERING

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.560
Unjust.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.320
Unkind.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.080
Unruly mob! But wait. What's this?

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.600
There's now no tank,
there's now no men!

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.360
Some loyalty!

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.040
Roberts! Roberts!

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.720
William, where's Roberts gone?

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.560
I said to take an hour off.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.960
You said?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.439
That's right, Your Majesty.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:40.600
"Your Majesty"?
But William, it's me.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.040
Despite the horrid things
you've done, it's me.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.960
So call me Dad, or Father,
if you like, but not Your Majesty,

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.279
like all the rest.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.840
I call you that for that
is what you are. Before my father,

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.160
long before all else you are the
King, and that's to whom I speak.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.240
But William, come look at this,
a book...

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.479
You think too much on books
and history.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:02.240
But what is power held
if never used?

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.000
Our duty's not to simply sit indoors
and hope things get resolved,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.160
but to engage all parties
and attempt to find a way...

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.200
"Engage all parties"?!
King's no such duty.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.560
Duty royal. Shared amongst us all.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.319
I do not request your counsel!

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:18.920
Instead it is support, expected,
and support that you must give.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.240
You should apologise for such
betrayal!

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.160
But I'll put it down to youth,
and nerves.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.520
Now help me and go fetch
good Roberts here.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.399
The tank was still remiss,

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:34.600
and all those guards Sir Matthew
kindly put in place have gone.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.920
I know.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.200
You know?

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.640
What do you mean, you know?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.520
Sir Matthew came to Kensington.
We spoke.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.439
I said with the unrest and violence

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:52.359
that has spread across the country
we should not be stoking it

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.920
with these provocative
militaristic shows.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.240
And what said he?

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.280
That it was not a show,

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.400
and that he had in consultation
here with you agreed

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.240
it was important that the palace
is defended

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.560
from attacks within the crowd.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.400
Exactly, you should not have
questioned it!

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.720
Having heard his answer I went on
that in an hour

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.480
I'll drive straight down The Mall
and enter through the guarded gates.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.920
I then intend to go around the yard
and if, I said, there is a tank,

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.360
I'll ask the men in blue
that they do move it off

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.720
because it is a danger

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.360
having such a deadly weapon
aimed towards the crowd.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:33.640
And when as promised I drove down
The Mall, police on either side,

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.240
expecting that the crowd
would see me and attack the car,

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:43.120
instead they saw who steered and
parted there to let us through.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:49.240
And as we went between the mob, a
silence briefly fell upon them all.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.440
It was most strange.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.160
They stopped and watched us go...

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.880
..and as the gates did
close behind us,

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.760
one girl called out,

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.960
"You tell him, Will"

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.320
And so I must.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.600
Must tell me...what?

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.800
You can't go back from
your decision now.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.240
Agreed,
retreating now would be the end.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.560
And yet you can't progress,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.680
the Parliament will never hold
elections as you wish. We'll see!

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.120
So I propose on coronation day,

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.160
we have two thrones upon the dais
placed, and sat on cushions

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.920
next to them are two crowns
awaiting royal heads to rest.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.200
Two thrones, two crowns?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.320
It is not possible for Britain and
the Commonwealth to have,

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.200
as you suggest,
two Kings in tandem rule.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.560
No, not two Kings. A King and Queen.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.880
Oh, you mean Camilla?

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.880
Oh, oft we have discussed...

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.360
Camilla, no.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.520
Then what DO you intend?

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.040
Cos if it's what I think

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.640
then you must speak the words of
treachery yourself

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.360
and shank your father
with a full and clear betrayal.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.120
I mean myself and Kate
are crowned instead.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.360
And what of me?

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.080
I simply stand aside?

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.920
You offer...abdication

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.440
and explain since
taking on the role,

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.360
you've felt your age.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.440
There's something in your face
I recognise.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.400
It was Diana...

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.440
where I saw it last, and I had hoped
that it had died with her.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.880
But here it is, in you,
ambition lurks!

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.280
I'm proud of that ambition,

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.320
I'm proud of her...

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.720
who, plucked so young,
before she knew the world,

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.440
and thrust into a den of lions keen
for meat, was given no protection.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:07.040
You cast my mum aside, discarded
and destroyed her by repute.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.960
No, I loved your mother at the time

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.960
and did my very best
to make sure you weren't harmed!

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.800
And that will be your tombstone -
"I did my best. At least I tried."

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.840
That's a plea for effort
rather than effect -

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.280
and that is you as husband,
you as son, as father, too,

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.560
and now as King.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.960
But all our sympathy is
withered up and dry.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.600
This is a job.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.840
You should've got it right
and you did not.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.080
Be careful what you say.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.920
You've always had my total love.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.160
I will not abdicate!

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.240
I will not abdicate!

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.200
Ungrateful boy!

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.360
I'll never give the Crown away.
For me it's duty and my calling,

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.760
things to do!

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.480
I know, don't ask me how,

01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.200
that I will be
the greatest king of all.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.880
The greatest king?!

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.920
And so you shall.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.880
For when they write the history
books about this

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.680
they will tell stories crisis-like

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.840
about the stormy days
after the Queen had died

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.920
and how for weeks
you contemplated hard

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.880
upon the right and proper thing to
do,

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.920
and, in the end, decided for the
good of all your people

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.920
and their long-term happiness
you would selflessly stand aside

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.720
and pass it on, to younger hands,

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.280
more popular and with more
time to reign.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.040
I will be King as ruler,
not as doormat stepped across.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.840
No, go!

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.880
I don't want to see you here!

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.960
Your Majesty...

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.360
..this is a sorry day,
but if you cannot sign the law

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.080
you must make way for one who can.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.800
I have brought here a document
to state official abdication,

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.000
so we can achieve a common goal -
stability.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.240
Who made this thing?

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.920
The civil service drew it up today.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.560
And printed out in haste -
there are mistakes in spelling!

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.840
Will you sign?

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960
I will not!

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.720
What's that document
you're holding there?

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.760
You must do nothing till
we have consulted with the experts

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.080
on the constitution.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.040
I thought it Harry that was wild,

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.600
but you have now by far surpassed
his worst excess.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.520
A vile and nasty child.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.240
I realise you and Catherine are the
king and queen of column inches

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.680
but you're just
a duke and duchess here!

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.560
The King is King! He will not sign.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.600
Your thin opinion of us demonstrates
how out of touch you are,

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.960
and jealous, too.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.840
Our looks don't make us cruel,
our youth is not an ignorance,

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.640
and detail in the way we dress
should not be thought as vanity,

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.120
but as part of the substance
only we provide.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.360
Our column inches are the
greatest influence we possess.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.320
Majesty, sign -
and bring an end to all this.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.000
DOOR OPENS

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.040
My son, your loyalty!

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.920
The people turn to William.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.960
This is the only way.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.800
I am convinced.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.000
Harry.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.360
My boys. My little boys.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.800
CHARLES SNIFFLES

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.480
Of course you're scared.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.040
But I know what I do,
so sit, let's talk.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.720
We'll sit and be your sons.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.040
But first you abdicate.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.280
And if I don't...

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.040
Then we will leave. Yes, us,
and Kate, the children. Family all.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.760
You will not see us till you
change your mind.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.040
I will not see my sons?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.280
Or grandchildren, too?

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.800
I cannot live alone.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.320
You're not alone.
And even if you were,

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.880
well, better that than
father-servant to your shallow sons.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.120
I cannot live alone.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.920
HE CRIES

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.080
It's done. The King is at an end.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:18.880
I will retreat to bed,
and when I wake to a new dawn,

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.840
I'll simply be an old
forgotten gardener,

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.240
who potters round and talks to
plants and chuckles to himself.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.400
Whilst far away the
King and Queen do rule

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.480
over a golden age of monarchy

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.280
that bothers no-one, does no good,

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.040
and is a pretty, plastic picture

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.160
with no meaning!

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.120
Sorry, ma'am, your name doesn't
appear on the list.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.680
What?

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.640
Miss Jessica...

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.440
Thank you.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.880
Why do you seem so lost?

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.520
The seating plan,
my name does not appear.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.240
You're sure the Prince
did make his invitation known?

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.240
Perhaps it would be best,
to find out from the man himself.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.040
Oh, here he comes,
so handsome in his uniform.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.240
Here's Jessica, who seems omitted
from the seating plan.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.800
Perhaps you'll know a little more
about this than I.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.480
Are you all right?

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.080
You'll not attend today.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.680
As William And Kate are crowned,
you'll have to watch outside.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.120
Outside? But why?

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.600
Harry?

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.080
My brother, talking with his wife,
and close advisors,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.240
feels it would be best
you not attend.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.880
You are too big a risk
to what he needs - stability.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.160
But that's not...

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.600
And furthermore...

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.760
..he's asked me personally if I
would stop all contact with you

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.320
and resume the way I was before,

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.880
a singleton, amusing, mostly
clownish and unthreatening.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.920
I hope you quickly told
him where to go.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.440
He's now the King.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.680
So King can tell you
who to love and what to feel?

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.720
The King is dictator of your heart?
My heart was made by King.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.960
If I betray allegiance,
then the little that I am is gone.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.000
If you loved me
you would fight this.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.880
Or if I have to go,
you'd come with me.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.560
I want to.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.600
Starting soon.
