01:19.461 --> 01:22.795
Anna, this is Brian.

01:22.797 --> 01:25.265
I was hoping you'd picked up.

01:25.267 --> 01:27.268
It's been a while

01:28.369 --> 01:30.036
I think I'm going to get sober

01:30.038 --> 01:32.038
again and I was thinking maybe

01:32.040 --> 01:35.044
that would be something you'd
want to help me out with

01:36.211 --> 01:38.110
What do you say?

01:38.112 --> 01:40.113
I'm going to go up to the cabin

01:40.115 --> 01:41.414
Maybe you'll join me.

01:41.416 --> 01:42.515
That would be great.

01:42.517 --> 01:43.518
Cause fuck...

01:45.386 --> 01:48.290
I just really need a friend
right now.

01:49.124 --> 01:55.396
Call me back if you can. Thanks.
Sorry.

01:56.497 --> 01:57.933
Fuck.

05:24.705 --> 05:29.308
after the season passes,
and the snow starts to melt,

05:29.310 --> 05:33.780
Reggie, he's walking his kid to
school,

05:33.782 --> 05:36.181
trying to get him to the bus
stop,

05:36.183 --> 05:37.051
Yeah

05:37.919 --> 05:39.285
They're cutting through the
woods

05:39.287 --> 05:44.556
and the kids looks over and sees
this hand

05:44.558 --> 05:47.193
sticking up out of the snow.

05:47.195 --> 05:47.926
Was it that chick?

05:47.928 --> 05:50.128
Yeah, it was the chick.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.463
Did her husband do it?

05:51.465 --> 05:54.333
Well that's what we thought.

05:54.335 --> 05:56.335
That's what everybody thought.

05:56.337 --> 05:57.302
It's always the husband, right?

05:57.304 --> 05:59.304
Typical.

05:59.306 --> 06:02.607
You should have seen what we
found in his trunk.

06:05.813 --> 06:08.616
Sorry about that.

06:09.416 --> 06:12.253
Do you have a...

06:13.221 --> 06:14.587
A broom?

06:14.589 --> 06:15.854
Yeah.

06:15.856 --> 06:18.059
Just leave it, dude.

06:41.815 --> 06:43.618
We've met before.

06:44.649 --> 06:46.152
What?

06:46.154 --> 06:48.153
I thought you said something.

06:48.155 --> 06:50.158
I didn't say anything.

06:52.327 --> 06:54.326
How much you have to drink this
morning?

06:54.328 --> 06:58.466
No, I haven't been drinking...
I'm not drunk.

06:59.566 --> 07:01.534
Can I just...

07:01.536 --> 07:04.436
You know you're paying for that
fuckin' bottle, right?

07:04.438 --> 07:06.842
Yeah, I know.

07:22.289 --> 07:23.859
Son of a bitch.

07:26.294 --> 07:29.261
I like a bit of
buck-shot with my venison.

07:29.263 --> 07:30.731
What?

07:31.399 --> 07:33.866
I didn't say anything again.

07:33.868 --> 07:36.635
There's seven kinds of something
wrong with you, isn't there boy?

07:36.637 --> 07:38.640
I don't know what you mean.

07:39.239 --> 07:41.242
What brings you up to my
mountain?

07:42.342 --> 07:43.676
I live here?

07:43.678 --> 07:44.479
No, you don't.

07:45.914 --> 07:49.314
I have a house here that I rent
it out.

07:49.316 --> 07:51.883
It's my ex wife's and mine.

07:51.885 --> 07:54.222
I'm staying there for a while.

07:55.423 --> 07:57.422
Am I making you nervous?

07:57.424 --> 07:59.861
Your hand is on your gun.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.527
So it is.

08:01.529 --> 08:02.764
What's your name?

08:03.231 --> 08:04.897
Brian.

08:04.899 --> 08:07.870
Brian? Like Prince or Madonna?

08:08.469 --> 08:10.404
Brian Barnes.

08:12.339 --> 08:14.739
Where's this house of yours
Brian Barnes?

08:14.741 --> 08:16.508
I don't have to tell you that.

08:16.510 --> 08:17.376
Don't you?

08:17.378 --> 08:17.846
No.

08:18.947 --> 08:20.749
Here I thought we could be
friends.

08:22.916 --> 08:24.253
Sorry.

12:23.223 --> 12:24.792
Fuck!

12:26.994 --> 12:31.129
Hello. Hey Anna.

12:31.131 --> 12:35.935
No, it's a great time.

12:35.937 --> 12:37.938
You got my voicemail?

12:38.905 --> 12:43.444
Yeah, same cabin.

12:44.178 --> 12:46.711
I'm gonna be up here as long as
it takes.

12:46.713 --> 12:50.148
I've got twelve hours in.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.819
I'm committed.

12:53.788 --> 12:54.653
What do you say?

12:54.655 --> 12:56.788
Do you want to help out an old
friend

12:56.790 --> 12:58.794
and come up?

12:59.593 --> 13:01.195
You're a sweetheart.

13:02.929 --> 13:06.635
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

14:05.092 --> 14:06.561
What?

14:07.193 --> 14:08.927
I didn't say anything.

14:08.929 --> 14:11.532
I know. What do you want?

14:12.332 --> 14:15.169
Just driving by. Thought I'd
check in on you.

14:16.202 --> 14:17.970
Weren't you wearing that some
thing yesterday?

14:17.972 --> 14:20.542
Yeah, I guess.

14:23.044 --> 14:25.009
Odd time to be renting this
place.

14:25.011 --> 14:26.644
Most of you people don't show up
till

14:26.646 --> 14:27.946
after the snow comes.

14:27.948 --> 14:30.582
I'm not renting it. I own it.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.586
I feel like we covered this.

14:33.353 --> 14:34.586
What's your name, son?

14:34.588 --> 14:36.590
Brian Barnes.

14:37.024 --> 14:39.591
I'm positive we had this
conversation yesterday.

14:39.593 --> 14:42.229
How long you gonna be on my
mountain, Brian Barnes?

14:45.165 --> 14:47.001
I haven't done anything wrong.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.373
Have yourself a good day.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.577
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

16:21.696 --> 16:24.733
That was not a brilliant idea,
was it?

17:41.175 --> 17:45.746
Anna? Hello?

17:46.013 --> 17:48.882
Anna? Are you up there?

17:50.484 --> 17:51.986
When did you get here?

17:52.986 --> 17:54.723
Why didn't you wake me up?

17:56.422 --> 17:57.791
Hello?

18:04.098 --> 18:08.367
Anna, are you in there? You
okay?

18:14.341 --> 18:16.276
I'm coming in, alright?

18:22.983 --> 18:25.053
What are you doing?

20:50.698 --> 20:52.633
Hey! Where are you?

20:54.968 --> 20:58.605
Yeah, I know where it is. I was
just there.

21:00.373 --> 21:03.507
I'll can come get you. It's
close.

21:03.509 --> 21:06.113
It's like ten minutes away.

21:08.215 --> 21:11.386
Don't worry about it. Seriously.

21:13.653 --> 21:15.686
You're the one doing me a favor.

21:15.688 --> 21:19.157
You're saving my life.
Seriously.

21:19.159 --> 21:24.064
Alright. I'm on my way. Bye.

22:31.398 --> 22:35.634
Ah, fuck. God damn it.

23:20.179 --> 23:21.713
Hey buddy, how you doing?

23:21.715 --> 23:23.717
Man, I know I wasn't speeding.

23:25.252 --> 23:26.721
You're up early?

23:27.254 --> 23:28.456
Is it?

23:29.790 --> 23:31.857
I did not peg you for an early
riser.

23:31.859 --> 23:34.892
Yeah, I'm going to the fuck'n
to the store.

23:34.894 --> 23:37.495
Ah. The fuck'n store.

23:37.497 --> 23:38.533
Sorry.

23:38.798 --> 23:39.763
For what?

23:39.765 --> 23:41.733
I don't know. Cursing.

23:41.735 --> 23:44.505
That's alright buddy. We're
friends, aren't we?

23:44.838 --> 23:47.175
At least, I'd like to think so.

23:48.275 --> 23:50.542
Alright, well, just wanted to
say good morning.

23:50.544 --> 23:51.309
Have a good one.

23:51.311 --> 23:52.343
Seriously?

23:52.345 --> 23:54.347
Yep. Oh.

23:55.482 --> 23:56.881
Glad you finally changed that
shirt.

23:56.883 --> 23:58.849
That last one was getting a
little ripe.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.854
See you around.

24:43.897 --> 24:46.697
Anything I can
help you with ma'am? Miss?

24:46.699 --> 24:48.702
No.

25:04.685 --> 25:09.221
Thank you. Look, I just want you
to know...

25:09.223 --> 25:11.225
Plenty of time to talk later.

25:16.396 --> 25:19.263
Do you have any real coffee at
your place?

25:19.265 --> 25:20.497
No, just that shit.

25:20.499 --> 25:22.502
I guess it'll have to do.

25:30.643 --> 25:31.811
I got it.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.457
That's $22 even.

26:01.541 --> 26:06.214
The fancy coffee arrives with
our caviar shipment next week.

26:07.781 --> 26:10.784
Great. Thanks. I'll be back
then.

26:15.354 --> 26:18.555
Jackass. I was making fun of
you.

26:18.557 --> 26:20.560
Idiot.

26:37.410 --> 26:40.814
What the fuck
did you do this time?

26:54.695 --> 26:57.628
People actually rent this place
from you?

26:57.630 --> 26:59.964
Yeah, they actually do.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.570
Come here. Sit down.

27:03.503 --> 27:05.436
We just got here. Do we have to
do this already?

27:05.438 --> 27:07.438
Yeah, and you just popped a
fistful of pills

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
after telling me you were
serious about getting

27:09.442 --> 27:10.774
sober for the umpteenth time.

27:10.776 --> 27:13.413
So yeah, let's do this now.

27:14.547 --> 27:17.415
Okay. Here I am.

27:17.417 --> 27:19.417
How long have you been using
again?

27:19.419 --> 27:21.418
I don't know.

27:21.420 --> 27:22.920
Jesus, Brian. Already?

27:22.922 --> 27:24.356
It's not that I don't know

27:24.358 --> 27:26.624
I didn't mark my fucking
calendar, okay?

27:26.626 --> 27:30.031
I got high again, and I told you
that.

27:31.665 --> 27:32.763
I know what you're asking.

27:32.765 --> 27:36.403
I started weeks ago

27:36.969 --> 27:38.773
or months ago.

27:39.505 --> 27:42.807
There's a pretty big difference
between weeks and months.

27:42.809 --> 27:44.809
I know there's a big difference
between weeks and months

27:44.811 --> 27:46.813
but you don't know how my
fucking brain works.

27:47.913 --> 27:50.648
I know exactly how your brain
works.

27:50.650 --> 27:52.649
Yeah, you know everything.

27:52.651 --> 27:54.654
Don't be an asshole.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.427
You want any?

28:00.025 --> 28:03.395
I didn't have to come here, you
know?

28:03.397 --> 28:06.934
I know. I'm sorry.

28:09.870 --> 28:14.038
Be honest with me. Do you have
any more shit at the house?

28:14.040 --> 28:17.509
Anything? Pills? Dope? Speed?

28:17.511 --> 28:18.944
No!

28:18.946 --> 28:21.478
You're not going to magically find
another stash from a year ago?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.483
No. I swear to god.

28:25.785 --> 28:29.154
Why do you want to be sober? Why
now?

28:29.156 --> 28:31.688
Does there have to be one
reason?

28:31.690 --> 28:34.728
Just be straight up with me,
Brian. Why am I here?

28:37.997 --> 28:41.901
I'm scared, okay? I'm fucking
scared.

28:44.504 --> 28:45.906
Of?

28:47.707 --> 28:49.874
Of doing shit that I can't take
back.

28:49.876 --> 28:51.876
Of shit that I can't even
remember.

28:51.878 --> 28:55.079
What's the fucking point anyway?

28:55.081 --> 28:56.214
It's not even fun anymore.

28:56.216 --> 28:57.715
Isn't it supposed to be fun?

28:57.717 --> 28:58.919
It's not.

29:00.786 --> 29:03.921
It's just who I am.

29:03.923 --> 29:05.924
Like I'm just a fucking dope
fiend.

29:05.926 --> 29:07.559
So, what happened?

29:07.561 --> 29:10.195
It's the same shit over and over
again.

29:10.197 --> 29:12.696
No matter what choices I think
I'm making,

29:12.698 --> 29:15.199
I'm not really making them
because I end up back here

29:15.201 --> 29:17.404
in the same fucking hell.

29:19.206 --> 29:21.906
You have to forgive yourself
first.

29:21.908 --> 29:24.141
I don't want forgiveness, okay?

29:24.143 --> 29:27.080
I want to feel everything, and I
want it to hurt.

29:30.015 --> 29:32.052
Do you know I lied to you.
Already.

29:34.220 --> 29:37.021
You came up here to help me. You
came all this fucking way.

29:37.023 --> 29:39.491
And I spit in your fucking face,
you know that?

29:39.493 --> 29:43.130
Cause all I really want to do
right now is get fucking high.

29:43.596 --> 29:45.932
Jesus. What the fuck, Brian?

29:47.700 --> 29:49.002
What is that?

29:50.570 --> 29:51.639
What?

29:56.141 --> 30:00.581
I'm asking you, what am I
holding in my hands right now?

30:01.680 --> 30:03.984
A hair ribbon.

30:05.185 --> 30:09.123
Good. So this is real.

30:10.823 --> 30:12.927
I'm experiencing this right now.

30:26.706 --> 30:27.875
I'm sorry.

30:30.544 --> 30:31.544
I'm sorry.

30:32.211 --> 30:33.613
I'm sorry.

31:06.845 --> 31:09.983
So, this is is gonna be you.
Again.

31:14.653 --> 31:17.088
Do you remember the last time we
were here?

31:17.090 --> 31:19.724
It wasn't that long ago.

31:19.726 --> 31:21.728
It was another lifetime ago.

31:22.595 --> 31:24.198
For you?

31:26.632 --> 31:28.001
Yeah.

31:28.267 --> 31:31.738
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

31:32.104 --> 31:36.206
It's good that you want to get
sober right now.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.211
It's a good thing.

31:40.780 --> 31:43.013
Do you know how I know there's
hope for you?

31:43.015 --> 31:44.081
How?

31:44.083 --> 31:49.186
This place. After all this time.
You never sold it.

31:49.188 --> 31:52.357
You never put it in your veins.

31:52.359 --> 31:58.165
But it is in my veins. I mean,
Meagan loved it.

31:58.732 --> 32:00.898
Another lifetime ago.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.834
No, that came out the wrong way.

32:03.836 --> 32:06.005
That's not what I meant.

32:10.243 --> 32:12.976
You're not still calling her,
are you?

32:12.978 --> 32:14.981
I try not to.

32:15.814 --> 32:17.618
Brian, you either do or you
don't.

32:18.649 --> 32:19.152
No, It's not like that.

32:21.955 --> 32:25.859
It's not like she wants to hear
from me.

32:27.127 --> 32:29.663
Brian, leave her alone.

32:30.095 --> 32:31.698
It's not fair to her.

32:35.134 --> 32:38.735
If she's the only reason you're
keeping this place,

32:38.737 --> 32:41.673
then maybe you should sell it.

32:41.675 --> 32:43.944
Or let her buy you out.

32:46.211 --> 32:51.249
It's not her. I mean, it's you.

32:51.251 --> 32:53.251
It's time we spent here.

32:53.253 --> 32:57.091
It's the way you look standing
there in the light.

32:58.123 --> 33:00.893
Stop it. That's never going to
happen again.

33:02.896 --> 33:07.098
I came here to help you. To try
to be your friend.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.433
Don't to take advantage of that.

33:08.435 --> 33:10.638
I know. You're right.

33:11.970 --> 33:15.740
I'm gonna get real hard to be
around, real fast.

33:15.742 --> 33:20.813
And, I'd be lying if I said I didn't
want to get high really bad right now.

33:22.348 --> 33:27.888
Just don't let me do it again,
okay?

33:29.288 --> 33:33.860
I can be better. I can be
different. Okay?

33:54.480 --> 33:57.050
What are you doing up? Couldn't
sleep?

34:17.969 --> 34:20.237
Anna?

34:20.239 --> 34:21.106
Brian!

34:21.108 --> 34:21.639
Anna, open up.

34:21.641 --> 34:24.378
Hold on. I hear you.

34:31.483 --> 34:32.918
What's going on?

34:35.021 --> 34:36.887
There's someone in the house.

34:36.889 --> 34:39.222
What are you talking about? Do
you know what time it is?

34:39.224 --> 34:41.226
I heard you downstairs.

34:42.393 --> 34:44.161
I wasn't downstairs.

34:44.164 --> 34:46.797
I know. It wasn't you, cause it
was a dead woman.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.899
You heard a dead woman
downstairs?

34:48.900 --> 34:50.902
Come here.

34:54.438 --> 34:56.072
I'm not fucking high, alright.

34:56.074 --> 34:59.943
Calm down, okay? Just think
about it.

34:59.945 --> 35:05.218
There isn't a dead woman
downstairs, is there?

35:10.523 --> 35:12.392
Brian?

35:14.093 --> 35:17.898
Don't mind me. I'm just losing
my fucking mind.

35:19.198 --> 35:23.968
I know if I think about it whe
I see things that aren't there,

35:23.970 --> 35:27.137
I can rationalize it then.

35:27.139 --> 35:32.211
But when it's happening when it's
right in front of my fucking eyes.

35:32.611 --> 35:35.012
Yeah, you're going through
withdrawal.

35:35.014 --> 35:36.213
No shit.

35:36.215 --> 35:38.951
Well, the hallucination is not a
coincidence.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.256
It doesn't make it any less
frightening.

35:47.059 --> 35:48.928
I'm sorry.

35:51.231 --> 35:55.102
Don't be. That's why I'm here.

35:57.135 --> 36:00.070
Can I sleep in here with you
tonight?

36:00.072 --> 36:02.073
Nice try.

36:02.075 --> 36:05.479
I didn't mean... like that.

36:07.579 --> 36:10.314
Okay, maybe a little bit.

36:10.316 --> 36:15.055
But, I don't want to go out
there.

36:16.055 --> 36:18.058
Just not tonight.

36:20.994 --> 36:24.965
It's just in your mind.

36:26.331 --> 36:29.035
Is that better or worse?

36:55.628 --> 36:58.465
Thanks for making coffee.

36:59.032 --> 37:02.533
Did you end up getting any sleep
last night?

37:02.535 --> 37:04.535
I can't be sure.

37:04.537 --> 37:07.939
It'll get easier.

37:07.941 --> 37:10.106
Hey, I'm sorry about that

37:10.108 --> 37:12.108
about last night.

37:12.110 --> 37:14.113
It's okay.

37:15.648 --> 37:20.053
It's so nice up here and quiet.

37:22.155 --> 37:24.457
Go easy Mr. Chimney.

37:25.023 --> 37:26.559
No thanks.

37:32.231 --> 37:33.600
What is it?

37:38.037 --> 37:42.472
When I got up this morning, I
couldn't even come downstairs

37:42.474 --> 37:44.475
until the sun was up.

37:44.477 --> 37:49.146
I was afraid to come down in the
dark, like a fucking child.

37:49.148 --> 37:52.249
It's not an easy thing you're
going through.

37:52.251 --> 37:55.354
You can cut yourself some slack.

37:57.356 --> 38:00.259
Come here. I want to show you
something

38:14.539 --> 38:18.177
Can you please open the drawer
for me?

38:22.081 --> 38:24.080
Why did you...?

38:24.082 --> 38:26.082
I don't remember tying that
ribbon on there,

38:26.084 --> 38:28.088
let alone, fishing it out of the
trash.

38:28.588 --> 38:30.787
You'll even out. You'll see.

38:30.789 --> 38:33.691
It doesn't worry you that I'm
playing with knives in my sleep?

38:33.693 --> 38:35.693
Because it fucking worries me.

38:35.695 --> 38:40.296
What worries me more is how
disgusting this knife is.

38:40.298 --> 38:44.003
I hope you don't actually cook
with it.

38:46.805 --> 38:49.976
Come on, I'll make us some
breakfast.

39:23.809 --> 39:25.675
Oh, this is too much.

39:25.677 --> 39:26.709
Who is that?

39:26.711 --> 39:28.715
Just stay here.

39:34.253 --> 39:36.155
Hey buddy. Good morning.

39:36.456 --> 39:38.622
This is getting fucking weird,
dude.

39:38.624 --> 39:40.124
What's getting weird?

39:40.126 --> 39:41.725
Can we not do this?

39:41.727 --> 39:44.331
Can we not pretend you don't know
you're being an asshole right now?

39:44.564 --> 39:47.601
Whoa Brian, no need to call
names.

39:48.166 --> 39:51.702
I'm just going to call your
supervisor and report you.

39:51.704 --> 39:52.602
For what?

39:52.604 --> 39:56.240
Harassment. What's your badge
number?

39:56.242 --> 39:57.575
My badge number?

39:57.577 --> 39:59.178
- Yeah.
- It's, uh...

39:59.678 --> 40:02.115
5-5-5-fuck-you.

40:04.550 --> 40:06.584
I'm just fucking with you,
Brian.

40:06.586 --> 40:10.357
We're friends aren't we?
I'd like to think so.

40:11.389 --> 40:14.325
You know, It's a big mountain.

40:14.327 --> 40:17.497
Not many people to play with
this time of year.

40:18.631 --> 40:21.899
You know where a guy can score
some dope around here?

40:21.901 --> 40:22.666
What?

40:22.668 --> 40:26.137
What? Oh, I didn't say anything.

40:26.139 --> 40:28.707
You have yourself a great day
Brian.

40:34.713 --> 40:36.713
What was that about?

40:36.715 --> 40:39.617
That's about that guy being
fucking crazy.

40:39.619 --> 40:44.187
And somebody thought it would be a
good idea to give him a badge and gun.

40:44.189 --> 40:47.390
Well, between you, him, and
that guy at the store,

40:47.392 --> 40:49.795
I'd say this town is not without
it's charm.

40:59.838 --> 41:03.843
At least I'm in good company
then, huh?

41:07.613 --> 41:10.117
Thank you. Thank you.

41:19.358 --> 41:20.494
Looks great.

41:24.963 --> 41:27.330
It's so great I don't want to
cut into it.

41:29.903 --> 41:36.343
Are you sure that you cooked this the
right way, cause I think I see a beak.

41:49.287 --> 41:51.722
What is it?

41:51.724 --> 41:53.724
It's nothing.

41:53.726 --> 41:55.225
Nothing?

41:55.227 --> 41:57.197
I thought I saw a deer.

41:58.363 --> 42:00.867
You're afraid of a deer?

42:02.602 --> 42:05.238
You know, I hit a deer once.

42:06.505 --> 42:10.510
I'd just turned sixteen. I'd
just gotten my license.

42:11.276 --> 42:14.577
I borrowed my dad's car for the
first and last time.

42:14.579 --> 42:20.783
It was early morning. I was out
driving. Still dark.

42:20.785 --> 42:24.454
And this thing ran out.

42:24.456 --> 42:26.756
So fast I didn't even have time
to tap the brakes.

42:26.758 --> 42:29.693
I couldn't even really see what
it was.

42:29.695 --> 42:31.695
And, I hit it.

42:31.697 --> 42:33.700
That sucks.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.902
Yeah.

42:38.371 --> 42:40.706
Did it die?

42:41.006 --> 42:46.979
I think so, but it fell off into
the shoulder,

42:48.514 --> 42:53.050
and I couldn't bring myself to
look at it - to see what I'd done.

42:53.052 --> 42:57.488
I just got back in the car and
drove away, like a fucking coward.

42:57.490 --> 43:00.660
Then how did you know it was a
deer?

43:03.928 --> 43:06.562
Because I turned and I looked
next to me.

43:06.564 --> 43:09.800
And in the passenger seat there
was a man sitting there.

43:09.802 --> 43:14.274
Only he had the head of a deer.
Right?

43:15.307 --> 43:19.709
And he's just staring at me. And
he's blinking with these black eyes.

43:19.711 --> 43:21.715
Staring at me.

43:23.682 --> 43:26.783
That was the first time I really
saw something that wasn't there.

43:26.785 --> 43:29.822
And I wasn't even high.

43:30.956 --> 43:33.892
So, what happened?

43:35.894 --> 43:38.796
Then I hit a light post and the
airbag went off.

43:38.798 --> 43:40.800
And the car was fucked.

44:02.488 --> 44:04.890
It's so real.

44:06.758 --> 44:08.327
I can smell the blood.

44:10.662 --> 44:14.333
It's so strong it's on my taste
buds.

44:14.599 --> 44:17.069
Like I have
a mouthful of pennies.

44:25.778 --> 44:28.915
As if it were never there at
all.

44:33.852 --> 44:39.459
Did you ever see a doctor about
seeing things?

44:41.827 --> 44:44.464
Come on. Let's go back.

44:51.669 --> 44:54.504
It must be beautiful
out here in the snow.

44:54.506 --> 44:57.677
Yeah. It is.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.528
Hey.

45:49.961 --> 45:52.064
I found this in the closet
upstairs.

45:52.898 --> 45:54.597
It looks like it might fit you,
right?

45:54.599 --> 45:56.600
Yeah, that's my dress.

45:56.602 --> 45:58.605
It was in your closet?

45:58.970 --> 46:00.572
Yeah.

46:00.773 --> 46:03.073
Eww. Do you think someone else
wore it?

46:03.075 --> 46:05.078
I don't know. It looks pretty
clean.

46:16.956 --> 46:20.193
You don't remember me in this
dress?

46:25.798 --> 46:27.100
Hmm.

46:27.733 --> 46:30.800
I'm gonna grab a cub of coffee.

46:30.802 --> 46:32.602
You have a problem.

46:32.604 --> 46:33.872
You think?

47:00.865 --> 47:02.798
I'm gonna grab a smoke, alright?

47:02.800 --> 47:04.803
Okay.

47:12.677 --> 47:14.947
Son of a bitch.

47:15.780 --> 47:18.247
I thought you were gonna go
smoke.

47:18.249 --> 47:19.216
Where'd you get those?

47:19.218 --> 47:22.084
You... see these? These are
glasses, right?

47:22.086 --> 47:22.919
Yes. Where did...?

47:22.921 --> 47:24.320
Son of a bitch!

47:24.322 --> 47:25.722
What?

47:25.724 --> 47:26.957
They were in the kitchen.

47:26.959 --> 47:28.559
So?

47:28.561 --> 47:32.095
That cop, He wears glasses like these.
I mean, these are his fucking glasses.

47:32.097 --> 47:33.796
What would he be doing in the
kitchen?

47:33.798 --> 47:38.170
I don't know what he's doing in the
kitchen. But that's it. That's enough.

47:38.970 --> 47:41.139
Who are you calling?

47:44.043 --> 47:48.247
Connect me to the White Deer
Sheriff's office, please.

47:49.747 --> 47:54.584
Hello? Yes, I want to make a
complaint about one of your officers.

47:54.586 --> 47:57.754
I don't know his name, but he's
but he's a white guy.

47:57.756 --> 47:59.756
He's got dark hair. He's got a
mustache.

47:59.758 --> 48:03.693
He's following me around. He's
harassing me.

48:03.695 --> 48:06.762
And now he's coming into my
house when I'm not home.

48:06.764 --> 48:10.800
Oh, hey there Brian.
How you doing buddy?

48:10.802 --> 48:15.939
I hate to break this to you man, but
this time of year, it's just me up here.

48:15.941 --> 48:18.611
Lone wolf. Keeping the herd in
line.

48:21.246 --> 48:22.812
Stay the fuck out of my house.

48:22.814 --> 48:24.013
Brian!

48:24.015 --> 48:26.816
Your house. My house.
What's the difference?

48:26.818 --> 48:31.153
I suspect you have a substance
abuse problem, Brian.

48:31.155 --> 48:33.592
Would that be an accurate
assessment?

48:35.026 --> 48:37.727
I could help you out with your
little problem.

48:37.729 --> 48:41.999
I could lock you up in a dark
dark place.

48:42.001 --> 48:45.234
Dry out your blood real fast.

48:45.236 --> 48:48.608
You want to get sober, don't you
pal?

50:27.005 --> 50:29.238
Brian!

50:29.240 --> 50:32.144
What are you doing down there?

50:33.479 --> 50:35.945
Nothing. I'm coming up. Hold
on.

50:35.947 --> 50:37.949
Jesus, one second.

50:49.394 --> 50:51.464
So?

50:52.164 --> 50:56.235
I thought I heard a rat. It was
nothing. Alright?

50:58.070 --> 51:02.171
That fucking cop, man. He's
freaking me out.

51:02.173 --> 51:08.245
Just do me a favor. If you see
him. Just steer clear.

51:08.247 --> 51:12.414
If he comes to the door, and I'm not
here, just don't answer it, okay?

51:12.416 --> 51:14.184
Where would you be?

51:14.186 --> 51:18.821
I'm just saying. I just have a
really bad feeling.

51:18.823 --> 51:21.358
Like he's coming into my house
when I'm not here.

51:21.360 --> 51:25.394
Like, maybe he's coming in all
the time,

51:25.396 --> 51:28.932
when no one's home. When the
place is empty. I don't know.

51:28.934 --> 51:31.470
I think you're being paranoid.

51:33.005 --> 51:35.340
Yeah, so they say.

51:41.345 --> 51:42.514
Come on.

51:53.592 --> 51:55.193
I'm coming.

52:10.909 --> 52:12.477
I brought you a towel.

52:13.077 --> 52:15.912
Jesus, Brian. Sneak up on a
girl, why don't you?

52:15.914 --> 52:18.180
Sorry. You alright?

52:18.182 --> 52:21.320
Yeah, I'm fine. You just scared
me. That's all.

52:23.988 --> 52:24.887
Anna?

52:24.889 --> 52:26.892
What is it?

52:27.191 --> 52:31.061
Can you come here please.
Just... out of the dark.

52:31.063 --> 52:33.064
Brian, what is it?

52:35.066 --> 52:40.169
I want you to turn around. And
tell me what you see,

52:40.171 --> 52:45.911
standing in the corner, behind
you.

52:47.613 --> 52:50.383
Brian, there's nothing there.

53:25.017 --> 53:32.390
Shhhhh. It's okay. It's okay. It
wasn't real. None of it was real.

53:33.291 --> 53:36.494
You're safe now. I've got you.

53:37.662 --> 53:39.930
It will be better in the
morning.

53:39.932 --> 53:44.871
No, just lay back. You hit your
head when you fell.

53:50.175 --> 53:55.314
Why can't it just be like this forever?
Without all the other stuff.

53:56.347 --> 53:59.885
It's just not the way life
works.

54:01.253 --> 54:02.988
What if I never get better?

54:03.722 --> 54:05.457
What if I can't be fixed?

54:07.358 --> 54:11.630
All the kings horses, and all
the kings men...

54:13.597 --> 54:15.467
- Anna?
- Yes?

54:16.300 --> 54:19.137
Can you indulge me one more
crazy thought?

54:19.403 --> 54:22.007
Well, I guess if I've made it
this far...

54:22.673 --> 54:24.039
What if that cop...

54:24.041 --> 54:25.408
Yes?

54:25.410 --> 54:28.544
What if he's hurting people in
this house... when it's empty.

54:28.546 --> 54:33.283
What if he's actually killing
people here, and I'm not crazy.

54:33.285 --> 54:37.590
I'm just, seeing... ghosts, I
guess.

54:39.358 --> 54:46.131
Well, that is a theory. But your logic
is flawed for two very big reasons.

54:46.597 --> 54:48.131
Why?

54:48.133 --> 54:51.501
One, we already know you're
crazy.

54:51.503 --> 54:55.474
And two, there are no such
things as ghosts.

54:59.276 --> 55:01.678
Nobody wants to be crazy, Anna.

55:01.680 --> 55:05.618
It's a horrible thing to not
have control of your own mind.

55:06.450 --> 55:09.054
I know. I'm sorry.

55:13.592 --> 55:16.428
Can you stay with me until I
fall asleep?

55:17.461 --> 55:20.796
I just feel like I haven't
really slept in days.

55:20.798 --> 55:26.568
Right now, here with you, I
finally feel safe.

55:26.570 --> 55:34.579
Sure. Get some rest. It will be
better in the morning. I promise.

55:37.416 --> 55:39.352
Will you marry me?

55:40.452 --> 55:42.321
Fuck off.

55:43.155 --> 55:45.524
Just checking.

56:13.351 --> 56:18.023
Fucking stop it already. I don't
believe you anymore.

56:24.162 --> 56:26.765
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:33.137 --> 56:34.736
Anna! Anna!

56:36.541 --> 56:38.044
Wait a minute!

56:42.347 --> 56:46.084
This is too much, Brian!

56:56.727 --> 57:03.269
Shhhhh. It's okay.

57:22.253 --> 57:27.423
It's okay. It wasn't real,
whatever it was.

57:27.425 --> 57:33.495
It's okay. I'm just here with
you, right now.

57:33.497 --> 57:35.501
I'm sorry.

57:39.704 --> 57:43.338
You're so good to me.

57:43.340 --> 57:45.343
Okay.

57:50.548 --> 57:52.717
No.

57:55.887 --> 58:00.258
Don't misinterpret why I'm here.

58:04.496 --> 58:07.166
Sorry.

58:13.438 --> 58:15.340
Don't do that.

58:16.441 --> 58:18.611
No, don't do that.

58:19.744 --> 58:23.445
Don't act like you're afraid of
me. Like I'm fucking crazy.

58:23.447 --> 58:25.450
I didn't say that.

58:26.684 --> 58:29.320
Stop. Please stop. Leave me
alone.

58:41.298 --> 58:44.369
Brian. You need to listen to me.

58:45.570 --> 58:48.738
You are scaring me now.

58:48.740 --> 58:51.608
I feel really uncomfortable.

58:51.610 --> 58:55.711
I just want you to leave. Just
leave the room. Okay?

58:55.713 --> 59:01.486
Let me get dressed. We can talk
after that. Downstairs.

59:06.390 --> 59:08.961
You're my only friend Anna.

59:09.860 --> 59:12.263
No one else stayed.

59:12.896 --> 59:16.901
I need help. I need help.

59:18.702 --> 59:22.004
I don't know if I can give you
the kind of help that you need.

59:22.006 --> 59:25.476
You have to. You have to.

59:26.977 --> 59:30.512
We can talk in a minute
downstairs, okay?

59:30.514 --> 59:35.253
We'll turn the lights on if
you're scared.

59:39.323 --> 59:44.026
Just remember, none of it is
real. It can't hurt you.

59:44.028 --> 59:46.231
Okay. It's not real.

59:47.698 --> 59:49.901
I'm going.

01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:10.376
Hey there Brian.

01:02:22.454 --> 01:02:25.657
No. Not her.

01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:28.459
It's been too late
for that for a while, buddy.

01:03:00.492 --> 01:03:01.727
Anna?

01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:15.673
Anna?

01:03:25.249 --> 01:03:26.717
Anna?

01:03:53.845 --> 01:03:54.980
Anna?

01:04:17.334 --> 01:04:20.606
Hey buddy. You having a bad day?

01:04:42.593 --> 01:04:48.196
Brian. I need you to come out of
that closet.

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:51.600
I need you to step out with your
hands first.

01:04:51.602 --> 01:04:54.003
And if I even think I see
anything in your fucking hands

01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:56.575
I'm gonna blow a hole in you the
size of Texas.

01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.210
I'm gonna count to three Brian.

01:04:59.711 --> 01:05:02.147
One. Two.

01:05:05.749 --> 01:05:10.289
Brian, if I have to open this door
myself you are not gonna like it.

01:05:13.023 --> 01:05:15.593
God damn some of a bitch.

01:05:30.675 --> 01:05:33.678
No no no.

01:05:35.947 --> 01:05:38.013
Not that either.

01:05:40.318 --> 01:05:42.254
Why did you do it?

01:05:42.919 --> 01:05:45.756
She was my only friend.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.262
Did you kill all these people in
my house?

01:05:50.894 --> 01:05:55.833
Shut up! Shut up! You don't get
to cry!

01:05:56.401 --> 01:05:58.070
Shut up.

01:06:00.771 --> 01:06:02.306
Shut up.

01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:06.244
Shhhh.

01:06:08.813 --> 01:06:11.383
Shut up.

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:16.087
Shut up.

01:06:24.061 --> 01:06:28.400
Shut up. Shut up.

01:07:34.865 --> 01:07:35.867
Yeah, that.

01:07:36.968 --> 01:07:37.969
Yes.

01:07:42.072 --> 01:07:43.074
Come on.

01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:03.095
Just doing some cleaning.

01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:05.093
Where's your buddy?

01:08:05.095 --> 01:08:06.461
My who?

01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:09.164
Your cop friend that's always in
here.

01:08:09.166 --> 01:08:12.267
I don't know. Probably out doing
cop shit, I guess.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:15.303
I just ask ‘cause I saw his car
out front.

01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:19.143
Oh, he's probably around back
taking a shit.

01:08:20.243 --> 01:08:23.180
Mean ole shit, more'n likely.

01:08:24.549 --> 01:08:26.384
I forgot something.

01:08:35.425 --> 01:08:37.129
Alright.

01:09:55.406 --> 01:09:57.442
Brian.

01:09:57.674 --> 01:10:00.344
He can't see me.

01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:18.159
Oh my god, Anna. It's Brian.
It's Brian.

01:10:20.298 --> 01:10:25.199
No. No. No, it's Brian.

01:10:25.201 --> 01:10:28.236
No, you're alright. Hold on.

01:10:28.238 --> 01:10:30.239
I'll take you to the hospital.

01:10:30.241 --> 01:10:33.943
I'm not to drunk to drive. I do
it all the time.

01:10:33.945 --> 01:10:35.280
It's alright.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.321
No, don't die. It's alright.
You're alright. You're alright.

01:10:46.323 --> 01:10:50.559
C'mon, we're going to the
hospital now.

01:10:50.561 --> 01:10:52.593
You'll be fine. C'mon.

01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:59.133
C'mon babe. We're going to the
hospital.

01:10:59.135 --> 01:11:01.136
You'll be alright.

01:11:01.138 --> 01:11:05.474
You're alright. C'mon.

01:11:05.476 --> 01:11:07.478
Oh no no.

01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:19.187
We're gonna go. It'll be fine.
They'll fix you.

01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:22.192
They'll sew you up, and you'll
be pretty.

01:11:37.407 --> 01:11:38.474
After you

01:11:38.476 --> 01:11:39.608
He's not even
supposed to be here, so

01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:41.610
Brian?

01:11:41.612 --> 01:11:45.180
Brian, where the fuck? Where are
you?

01:11:45.182 --> 01:11:47.181
He's probably sleeping one off.

01:11:47.183 --> 01:11:48.218
Are you here?

01:11:49.219 --> 01:11:50.988
Well, he's not supposed to be
here at all.

01:11:52.089 --> 01:11:53.254
Brian.

01:11:53.256 --> 01:11:57.325
Just a minute. I'm coming down,
don't come up here.

01:11:57.327 --> 01:11:59.694
Okay, we're going to be in the
kitchen whenever you

01:11:59.696 --> 01:12:00.930
want to get your shit together.

01:12:00.932 --> 01:12:03.635
Meagan Oh,
I don't even care anymore.

01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:11.242
I'm coming down. It's alright.
I'm fine.

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:21.186
There you are.

01:12:24.155 --> 01:12:26.758
I was just... cleaning.

01:12:27.157 --> 01:12:28.692
Yeah, I can see that.

01:12:29.226 --> 01:12:31.329
The whole place reeks of bleach.

01:12:32.162 --> 01:12:33.662
It does?

01:12:33.664 --> 01:12:36.832
Look, I appreciate you wanting
to clean up after yourself

01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:39.635
But you have to let me know when
you're going to be up here

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:41.602
so we can avoid this.

01:12:41.604 --> 01:12:42.639
This?

01:12:43.773 --> 01:12:45.541
Who you got up there with you
Brian?

01:12:45.543 --> 01:12:47.545
No one.

01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:53.385
Oh my god. Are you high right
now?

01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:55.152
It's not even noon.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.787
No.

01:12:57.554 --> 01:12:59.555
Hey, look what I found.

01:13:00.857 --> 01:13:02.591
Oh hi Brian.

01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:03.559
Todd.

01:13:03.561 --> 01:13:06.662
Not high, huh? How much was in
that baggy?

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:11.300
What was it this time? Coke?
Speed? Heroin?

01:13:11.302 --> 01:13:14.406
And who the fuck is that whore
behind you?

01:13:23.214 --> 01:13:25.446
What the fucking fuck!

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:27.451
Shhh. You'll wake the baby.

01:13:28.384 --> 01:13:29.618
The baby?

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:36.094
Well, she's not a baby anymore.
Alecia. Todd's daughter.

01:13:38.495 --> 01:13:39.761
You want a snort?

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.366
I'm trying to quit.

01:13:42.398 --> 01:13:44.268
Sure you are kid.

01:13:47.304 --> 01:13:50.605
And don't give me that shit about
not drinking in front of you.

01:13:50.607 --> 01:13:52.373
I'm not the one with the
problem.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:55.179
Why should I be punished just
because you're a fucking drunk?

01:13:55.845 --> 01:13:57.879
Because you're my wife.

01:13:57.881 --> 01:14:00.085
Past tense.

01:14:03.286 --> 01:14:05.389
I don't even know what that
means anymore.

01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:08.125
There he is.

01:14:09.326 --> 01:14:11.396
Come on, come one, there he is!

01:14:12.862 --> 01:14:15.833
Why should you care? You're not
the one with the fucking problem.

01:14:16.666 --> 01:14:22.404
You know Brian, I look at you
now, and I just think

01:14:22.406 --> 01:14:25.407
How the fuck did I ever fall in
love with such

01:14:25.409 --> 01:14:28.310
a pathetic limp dick cock sucker
like you?

01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:31.245
That's okay Meagan. You're not
even here.

01:14:31.247 --> 01:14:32.247
What the fuck are you talking
about?

01:14:32.249 --> 01:14:34.583
It's just me and me and me.

01:14:34.585 --> 01:14:36.584
Todd, will you get down here!

01:14:36.586 --> 01:14:37.351
Todd's not here either. It's
just me.

01:14:37.353 --> 01:14:37.852
Todd!

01:14:37.854 --> 01:14:38.555
Todd!

01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:41.222
Fuck you Brian!

01:14:41.224 --> 01:14:43.227
Don't you ever fucking put your
hands on me.

01:15:03.847 --> 01:15:06.550
Alecia, go to your room now!

01:15:10.955 --> 01:15:11.852
Wait!

01:16:09.312 --> 01:16:11.812
Is there anyone else left alive
in here?!

01:16:11.814 --> 01:16:15.684
Or can I finally get some
fucking sleep?

01:16:19.322 --> 01:16:27.331
I was just kidding. Okay. Okay.

01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:56.794
Get off of me!

01:16:57.728 --> 01:16:59.430
Help!

01:17:10.674 --> 01:17:14.008
I'll be quick. It'll be over so
quick.

01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:16.677
You'll be with your daddy soon.

01:17:21.985 --> 01:17:29.760
It's all just a bad dream, little girl. Please
don't cry. It'll be better in the morning.

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:34.464
I'm gonna quit this time. I
promise.

01:17:51.548 --> 01:17:54.518
No no no no.

01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:57.655
I was kidding. I was just
kidding. I was kidding.

01:18:37.126 --> 01:18:39.895
It's not real anyway. It's okay.

01:18:39.897 --> 01:18:44.199
It's fine. It's fucking fine.

01:18:44.201 --> 01:18:48.502
It's alright. It doesn't matter.

01:18:48.504 --> 01:18:53.844
It's gone tomorrow. You're gone
tomorrow. It's fine.

01:18:55.912 --> 01:19:02.452
I need a drink. I'll be back,
okay?

01:19:56.607 --> 01:20:04.482
Anna. Hey, this is Brian. I was
hoping you'd pick up.

01:20:07.017 --> 01:20:11.555
I think I'm going to take a trip
out to the cabin

01:20:12.255 --> 01:20:14.691
and dry out again.

01:20:15.157 --> 01:20:18.592
I really need it this time.

01:20:18.594 --> 01:20:22.532
I was hoping maybe you'd want to
come out and

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.969
help me out with that.

01:20:26.937 --> 01:20:30.942
I'd love to hear from you. It's
been a while.

01:20:33.043 --> 01:20:37.514
I guess that's it. Just call me
back if you can, alright?

01:20:38.115 --> 01:20:41.585
Okay, thanks. I'm sorry.
