00:15.210 --> 00:23.210
Argentina! Argentina!

00:40.060 --> 00:42.050
What will you? I will.

00:42.090 --> 00:46.260
You can't come. Go home, Sofia.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.230
You can't come today.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.230
Now, please go home.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.050
Argentina!

01:52.220 --> 01:56.120
My money,
please. We pay a maximum of 20 pesos.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.240
I have 2000 pesos. Max. 20 pesos.

02:01.260 --> 02:03.090
That's my money!

02:05.170 --> 02:07.230
Ramiro. I beg you.

02:08.020 --> 02:11.140
Do you think you can steal my money?

02:11.180 --> 02:14.070
Not without my money!

02:24.240 --> 02:27.030
No.

02:29.180 --> 02:32.220
Give me my money. We can't, Ramiro.

02:32.260 --> 02:36.240
Give me my money. My
company has gone bankrupt.

02:37.030 --> 02:41.220
The bank has no cash. Sorry,
but that's it.

02:54.140 --> 03:00.050
We are born innocents. We believe
that love is stronger than hate.

03:09.130 --> 03:10.230
Sooner or later...

03:11.020 --> 03:12.220
Ramiro!

03:20.230 --> 03:23.150
Our innocence is shattered.

03:32.220 --> 03:35.070
We see the bad guys defeat the good.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.190
We learn that fear can crush hope.

03:45.130 --> 03:48.150
We mourn our lost innocence.

03:48.190 --> 03:53.080
But even more,
we long to defend the weak.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.100
To balance the weight bowls.

04:09.080 --> 04:14.220
Banco de Rosa collapse.
Morgan's customers are getting rich

04:15.190 --> 04:19.110
To defeat the men whose
hands are dripping with blood.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.140
Kl. 23:58

04:58.180 --> 05:02.080
Do you know she was murdered?
You need to look into that.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.020
Do you have whiskey?

05:04.060 --> 05:07.060
Without is? Yes please.

05:07.100 --> 05:13.260
I'd love to take your money,
but if Carrie died of an overdose...

05:18.110 --> 05:25.100
I want to know why she was In
London. It was no coincidence.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.260
Sometimes it is.

05:36.110 --> 05:40.030
Okay. I understand.

05:40.070 --> 05:44.120
Someone should be
blamed. A mysterious stranger.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.160
Did the thought strike you that
you have already found him?

05:53.220 --> 05:56.190
You should get a tattoo like mine.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.130
Is it okay? Cheers.

06:07.220 --> 06:12.020
Irish bonds? It's top secret.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.060
Cali. Cali.

06:55.210 --> 06:58.120
Irish economy grew rapidly.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.110
The market is constantly dead.

07:03.110 --> 07:08.030
It makes good sense that the
Conservatives were elected...

07:08.070 --> 07:09.230
Mr. Morgan.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.190
Good morning, Hans.

07:15.190 --> 07:19.060
Do you remember my
colleague Karl Haufman?

07:19.100 --> 07:22.200
What's the problem,
Hans? You go straight to the case.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.090
Is it about the deal?

07:25.240 --> 07:30.080
Rhine tails have to cancel
the deal. Preliminary.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.090
Is it completely fixed?
I have no choice.

07:35.130 --> 07:38.260
You always have a choice,
Hans. You're the boss.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.040
Karl?

07:41.080 --> 07:45.190
The finance minister says it
runs counter to German interests.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.170
The Minister of
Finance must interfere.

07:48.210 --> 07:53.060
We must obey our government.
What about your bank's interests?

07:53.100 --> 07:56.230
Have you seen the news?
Ireland is on your knees.

07:57.020 --> 08:00.060
How many bonds did you
buy during the recovery?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.150
They are becoming a
bitter pill to swallow now.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.020
Are you threatening me?

08:06.060 --> 08:09.250
You cancel the agreement.
And it does not entice me.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.020
You could try to get the
minister to change his mind.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.080
Maybe.

08:20.070 --> 08:24.210
Do you then keep
our exposure to Ireland

08:24.250 --> 08:28.020
for yourself?

08:29.050 --> 08:33.169
Ireland has had to accept
emergency aid from the EU

08:33.210 --> 08:37.159
after government debt
has reached critical heights.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.230
How much did Rheinthaler
buy for? Four billion

08:41.020 --> 08:44.070
It's confidential. How did
you round up Haufman?

08:44.110 --> 08:49.230
Sushi at Mabu,
beer and a shabby strip club.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.170
Can Rheinthaler Bank
risk losing four billion?

08:57.210 --> 09:01.200
They will meet soon.
He won't sell them yet.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.190
Sooner or later he should.

09:03.230 --> 09:07.030
And when that happens,
Irish banks fall.

09:07.070 --> 09:09.150
We can sell now in secret.

09:09.190 --> 09:13.190
That would be stupid.
We kill for that kind of info.

09:13.230 --> 09:18.140
Start short, but only slightly.
It must not be traceable to us.

09:18.180 --> 09:21.140
Okay. Oliver.

09:21.180 --> 09:25.020
Review Irish bonds sold

09:25.060 --> 09:29.110
to Rheinthaler Bank and
other major banks in the EU.

09:29.150 --> 09:31.020
Yes.

09:39.210 --> 09:43.110
Commissioner Bale? I
hope you have not waited.

09:44.110 --> 09:48.040
I enjoyed the silence.
It's a beautiful place.

09:49.100 --> 09:53.200
My daughter is riding
here. What a wonderful life.

09:55.060 --> 09:58.240
We bankers have been lucky.

10:01.070 --> 10:04.180
The colleagues would not
welcome me talking to you.

10:04.220 --> 10:09.070
Then why are you doing
this? I'm in favor of the truth.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.060
No one needs to know anything.
What do you know, mr. Bailey?

10:15.100 --> 10:21.040
It's about Ed Stuart's death.
And Massimo Ruggero.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.120
Hey.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.260
Was it late? No,
I just couldn't sleep.

10:49.050 --> 10:51.110
Should I be worried? No.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.110
I need someone I can
trust. Robert McKenna.

10:59.150 --> 11:04.160
I know the name. He is a
journalist at a news agency.

11:04.200 --> 11:11.180
CNA is the cover for a spy
service. He contacted us last night.

11:11.220 --> 11:14.150
He says he has information.

11:14.190 --> 11:17.250
A trap? Or a man of conscience.

11:18.040 --> 11:23.150
They say they exist. But it is very
difficult to see the difference between them.

11:23.190 --> 11:28.190
I'm sure you can. Thanks
for giving me another chance.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.220
This is the last one.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.200
You wanted to talk to me. Sit down.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.080
Thanks.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.240
Chris and I have talked
together. We restructured a bit.

11:47.030 --> 11:49.100
You hear it first.

11:49.140 --> 11:53.180
I didn't know Chris decides
here. Did I miss a memo?

11:53.220 --> 11:57.170
Because of the LIA case,
we have to keep our path clean.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.250
Want to update him?

12:00.040 --> 12:05.070
Massimo may already be doing his job.
Tell me if you have any questions.

12:05.110 --> 12:07.030
The gentlemen.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.040
He's not that bad.

12:11.080 --> 12:16.150
He is no good at anything other than
taking credit for the work of others.

12:16.190 --> 12:21.040
Political bias has value.
The board likes him.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.160
Like Ed.

12:24.170 --> 12:27.080
After all, it didn't end so well.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.020
The deputy chair remains empty.

12:32.060 --> 12:37.260
Chris has to work with risk
management. He is watching our VaR.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.210
Okay.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.080
Does Chris control our
VaR? As you can see.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.120
He lowered it by two.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.210
He keeps us short. Asshole.

12:56.250 --> 13:00.230
Sorry, but I don't know what VaR is.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.070
The VaR is a figure for
the risk we must take.

13:04.110 --> 13:07.250
The lower the VaR,
the less we have to bet. It means...

13:08.040 --> 13:10.100
Less earnings. In theory.

13:10.140 --> 13:14.200
In practice,
there are ways to get around the VaR.

13:14.240 --> 13:19.030
We should do that right
now. No. We control ourselves.

13:20.210 --> 13:26.190
With that VaR, we can forget about
shortlisting Ireland or making money.

13:26.230 --> 13:31.240
So forget about it. We
follow the rules to the point.

13:32.030 --> 13:36.020
But without Paul,
we're going back in this quarter.

13:36.060 --> 13:39.200
Didn't you hear what I said? Jo.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.230
Well. Yes, boss.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.160
You look good, Margaret.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.040
You are lying. I come
directly from D.C.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.120
You thrive in headwinds.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.160
I'll be flying again in an hour.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.020
How can I help?

13:58.060 --> 14:01.260
I hear Hans Becker
visited you this morning.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.050
You are well informed.

14:06.160 --> 14:10.020
What did he want? He
will cancel our agreement.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.170
The finance minister is pushing him.

14:12.210 --> 14:17.060
You have to convince
them. It's not about that.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.030
Becker could do nothing.

14:20.070 --> 14:24.160
You have to fix it. Washington will
not put political pressure on them.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.040
They are not on our side this time.

14:29.100 --> 14:34.110
A ceasefire ceremony will
be held. Let me talk to them.

14:35.150 --> 14:42.100
Okay. And your mole?
Have you found him yet?

14:44.120 --> 14:47.140
He's hiding my nose.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.200
Anything new about Carrie?

14:54.240 --> 14:57.060
Only 24 hours have passed.

15:04.220 --> 15:08.080
Kate? Commissioner Bale is calling.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.190
Okay. Will you threaten me again,
Commissioner?

15:12.230 --> 15:15.140
I didn't threaten you.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.150
My colleague Oliver
Harris does not agree.

15:18.190 --> 15:22.040
We are done with mr. Harris.
We want to talk to you.

15:24.230 --> 15:28.170
Look past the
station. It's a bad time.

15:28.210 --> 15:33.070
Come anyway. Otherwise,
we team up with a news team.

16:08.250 --> 16:11.230
Pay attention to the gap between...

16:22.060 --> 16:26.120
You don't get shaded? No. Do you?

16:26.160 --> 16:30.160
What do you have? A
story about Gaddafi and LIA.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.080
What?

16:32.120 --> 16:37.060
Something was going on,
but you went for the wrong goal.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.190
NYL works for the United States.

16:39.230 --> 16:43.240
The government? Bigger
than the government.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.190
And the mass graves?
It wasn't digging.

16:46.230 --> 16:48.160
I saw them myself.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.200
We all did. The video was scam.

16:52.240 --> 16:57.040
Someone would force
a military intervention

16:57.080 --> 17:00.050
so Gaddafi ended up like Saddam.

17:04.060 --> 17:06.050
You are lying.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.089
I'm sorry I did.

17:11.190 --> 17:16.099
10,000 dead,
55,000 wounded. And it never happened.

17:16.140 --> 17:19.050
The video and pictures
are several years old.

17:21.190 --> 17:25.250
Pay attention to the gap
between the train and the platform.

17:27.050 --> 17:30.150
You saw a cemetery. Here is the proof.

17:31.210 --> 17:36.160
Why don't you leak it
yourself? I work for those pigs.

17:38.030 --> 17:40.150
My conscience brought me to you.

17:40.190 --> 17:44.040
But I want to see my kids grow up.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.090
Duval says I can trust you.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.030
So can you.

18:05.190 --> 18:09.070
Forced to accept EU emergency aid...

18:09.110 --> 18:13.020
Something new? Irish
housing stocks are falling.

18:13.060 --> 18:18.100
Our VaR costs DKK millions.
Every minute. I'll be here in an hour.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.210
Now we act.

18:25.250 --> 18:30.210
No, don't send it to
Jason. Don't short them.

18:30.250 --> 18:34.150
What do you think they are
thinking? Acheng, Davenport, Libya.

18:34.190 --> 18:37.220
They say Massimo has lost his feeling.

18:37.260 --> 18:40.260
Massimo said no. Are
they really saying that?

18:41.050 --> 18:45.070
We have to help him. We must
not miss the trade of the century.

18:45.110 --> 18:47.110
He may know more than us.

18:47.150 --> 18:52.100
The VaR is in the system. Everyone is
watching if someone breaks the rules.

18:52.140 --> 18:57.200
What if we change the rules?
It requires a computer expert.

19:03.130 --> 19:04.210
What ...?

19:04.250 --> 19:06.150
POLICE STATION

19:06.190 --> 19:09.240
Mr. Ruggero? Follow me, please.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.150
How can I help?

19:18.200 --> 19:23.160
Inquiry started at 12.20. Present
are Commissioner Bale, and Winks.

19:27.190 --> 19:30.220
We have new traces in the
case of your friend Ed Stuart.

19:30.260 --> 19:34.070
We were not friends. No.

19:34.110 --> 19:38.250
Mr. Stuart didn't die in death,
he was pushed.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.260
Are you sure?

19:44.050 --> 19:47.020
Did you know mr. Stuart's
case file about you?

19:49.130 --> 19:52.200
No. Who said he had one?

19:52.240 --> 19:57.050
He would probably prevent you
from becoming deputy director.

19:57.090 --> 20:01.060
He describes in detail
your questionable actions.

20:02.230 --> 20:05.070
Do I have to see the folder? No.

20:06.110 --> 20:09.210
I don't make questionable trades.

20:09.250 --> 20:15.040
Why everything is,
you and mr. Stuart to be rivals.

20:21.060 --> 20:25.230
Are you saying that...
I'm in the spotlight?

20:32.100 --> 20:35.260
A man was murdered in
front of friends and colleagues.

20:36.050 --> 20:38.210
He left behind wife and children.

20:38.250 --> 20:44.190
Are you saying that "Massimo and
Ed hated each other" is your theory?

20:44.230 --> 20:49.210
Seriously? You are what I
usually call a loss-making asset.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.210
Can I leave now?

21:02.060 --> 21:10.020
Claire?

21:14.210 --> 21:17.190
Ed was murdered. I knew it.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.150
What did he become?

21:21.160 --> 21:24.230
Police can prove he did not jump.

21:26.230 --> 21:32.140
God. Claire,
it hurts me. Do they know who or why?

21:32.180 --> 21:36.160
I'll find it. Was it murder,
it was over money.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.220
And if so, the evidence must be here.

21:39.260 --> 21:41.260
Okay. I am helping you.

21:44.210 --> 21:48.080
You know what? I want to be alone.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.040
Of course.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.210
EDWARD STUARTS TESTAMENTS

22:19.230 --> 22:21.060
Yes?

22:21.100 --> 22:24.130
We were right about Libya,
but not as expected.

22:24.170 --> 22:30.050
It's over. Don't call again.
Seriously? I have new information.

22:30.090 --> 22:32.220
I do not care. Wait...

22:39.120 --> 22:42.230
The images of the graves
were undoubtedly manipulated.

22:43.020 --> 22:47.140
The death toll was confirmed
by the ICC Libyan delegation.

22:47.180 --> 22:52.100
Yes, by Sayed Al Shanuka,
who has been bribed by the LIA.

22:53.240 --> 22:58.170
Gaddafi was a lesser threat
than Saddam. Why remove him?

22:58.210 --> 23:03.150
That's a good question
that I can't answer yet.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.260
Well done, Sof. Thanks.

23:07.050 --> 23:11.080
Send the files and resolve
the situation with Massimo.

23:14.020 --> 23:18.030
Yes. I just need to
have them sorted first.

23:19.220 --> 23:22.180
How long does it take? It goes fast.

23:22.220 --> 23:25.060
I'll send them tomorrow. Okay.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.040
Well.

23:32.090 --> 23:36.180
How long has he lived here?
Since the wife threw him out.

23:41.070 --> 23:44.050
Yes? Commissioner
Bale and Assistant Winks.

23:44.090 --> 23:48.190
Yes. What do they want? It's
about Edward Stuart's death.

23:48.230 --> 23:53.040
I was not involved. But we
think Massimo Ruggero was.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.190
Okay.

24:08.230 --> 24:11.220
Someone has deleted Carrie. No trace.

24:11.260 --> 24:16.240
Carrie deleted. No trace

24:20.130 --> 24:27.260
Who?

25:09.100 --> 25:11.020
Final version!

25:24.170 --> 25:27.150
EDWARD STUARTS TESTAMENTS

25:31.180 --> 25:33.060
RUGGERO

25:35.220 --> 25:38.130
INVESTIGATE IT. NYC

26:18.060 --> 26:21.060
What are you doing
here? Hello old friend.

26:21.100 --> 26:24.090
I told the police about Massimo.

26:25.210 --> 26:31.020
About Carrie showed up at the
club and Massimo thinks Ed sent her.

26:32.190 --> 26:36.180
Why did you tell me? They
think Massimo murdered Ed.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.220
It's crazy. Is it?

26:41.020 --> 26:43.020
Why did you say that?

26:43.060 --> 26:49.050
Max fired me after ten
years. Ten years, man.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.180
He had his reasons.

26:51.220 --> 26:57.050
He is being charged with
murder. Massimo is done. See you.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.060
You look happy.

27:12.060 --> 27:14.230
Of course. I'm on my way up.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.120
Especially now that Ed is gone.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.210
You have ridden on the
backs of everyone to reach it.

27:21.250 --> 27:25.090
Insult me ​​while you
can. It will end soon.

27:25.130 --> 27:29.060
Why? I think so, you know.

27:31.170 --> 27:33.260
You've talked to the police.

27:34.050 --> 27:39.100
It is not necessary. Everyone
knows about your whore wife.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.140
Get up.

27:53.150 --> 27:57.050
Massimo. Oh no.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.250
It is okay.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.220
Have you gone crazy?

28:11.260 --> 28:16.260
Chris can report you. You assaulted
an employee here in the house.

28:17.050 --> 28:20.240
I want an explanation before you go.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.180
Police believe Ed was murdered.

28:25.180 --> 28:29.040
They think it was me. Why?

28:29.080 --> 28:33.160
Because Chris Bailey
has spread lies about me.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.170
Why? He will be deputy director.

28:37.210 --> 28:41.230
When did you find out
about this? Yesterday.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.170
Why didn't you say
that? I wasn't the only one.

28:45.210 --> 28:50.200
Obviously not. It is absurd to think
that you have murdered someone.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.260
Even despite today's episode.

28:55.090 --> 28:59.070
Go home and rest. I ask
Chris not to report you.

28:59.110 --> 29:03.030
And then I stop that investigation.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.170
Okay.

29:24.130 --> 29:28.020
The next train leaves from track 3.

29:47.190 --> 29:51.200
Are there any problems? No,
your material is good.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.250
So what? It's dangerous to meet.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.220
I need information about
a woman. Carrie Price.

29:58.260 --> 30:02.030
Who is it? You have to find out.

30:02.070 --> 30:06.140
We have not agreed. We have it now.

30:06.180 --> 30:10.070
You work for the United
States. They say that if you ask.

30:10.110 --> 30:14.100
Depending on who she is,
I can spotlight.

30:14.140 --> 30:20.260
I also run a risk. Do it or find
yourself another gossip hand.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.080
Next train from track 4...

30:32.240 --> 30:34.150
Mr. Rigby? Yes?

30:34.190 --> 30:37.220
Come in. Mr. Trevor is accepting now.

30:40.210 --> 30:46.240
Mr. Rigby, tea or coffee? I've
been invited, but no thanks.

30:47.030 --> 30:49.150
I don't know why I'm here.

30:49.190 --> 30:55.120
I have heard that you have
inquired about a certain Carrie Price.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.140
Who says that?

30:57.180 --> 31:01.060
They have hardly
been able to sniff much.

31:01.100 --> 31:04.120
I will neither confirm
nor rebuke anything.

31:04.160 --> 31:10.060
Of course not. They
take discretion seriously.

31:10.100 --> 31:13.180
They are a capable detective,
mr. Rigby.

31:13.220 --> 31:19.150
But they seem to have
some problems themselves.

31:19.190 --> 31:24.070
Two ex-wives and one child.
And they are an alcoholic.

31:24.110 --> 31:27.190
What do they want? I
don't want to hurt you.

31:27.230 --> 31:31.110
I want to help if you help me.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.150
There are 50,000 pounds.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.180
For what? Nothing difficult.

31:41.220 --> 31:46.100
You told your client you can't
find anything about Carrie.

31:46.140 --> 31:49.090
Keep it up.

31:54.020 --> 31:56.220
I shouldn't do this.

31:56.260 --> 32:02.210
Massimo asked us to abide
by the rules, which we do.

32:03.230 --> 32:08.210
We just change the rules a bit.

32:08.250 --> 32:14.080
If we are taken,
we may be charged with computer fraud.

32:14.120 --> 32:20.080
The VaR is like nose skin. You
can drag it as far as you want.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.130
Great, Kalim. It is set
for one trade at a time.

32:24.170 --> 32:29.190
We just have to choose
a value for each trade.

32:29.230 --> 32:32.140
On the Irish bonds? Yes.

32:35.170 --> 32:41.030
If we link a Raspberry
PI to a minicomputer

32:41.070 --> 32:45.130
which sits on the risk department
computer in the central network

32:45.170 --> 32:48.180
we can remotely
control data traffic with it.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.150
Did you get it?

32:51.190 --> 32:55.140
If it works,
then when the money rolls in?

32:55.180 --> 32:59.090
Chris wants to see that we
have made millions. Massimo too.

32:59.130 --> 33:04.030
Have you heard of a team that
was fired for making millions?

33:59.160 --> 34:05.020
We are gathered here today to
commemorate those who gave their lives

34:05.060 --> 34:09.130
for the freedom of future generations.

34:13.150 --> 34:19.020
Too bad that Nina isn't here. Yes,
but Nina is busy.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.020
Do I have to change my mind now?

34:22.060 --> 34:26.040
The German Ministry of
Finance needs my support.

34:26.080 --> 34:30.159
Jaså? Some believe
the dollar's time is over.

34:32.040 --> 34:39.040
The euro is not as strong as
before and Rheinthaler Bank is weak.

34:39.080 --> 34:43.239
The responsibility
is ours. We'll fix it.

34:44.030 --> 34:48.139
By letting the bank go
bankrupt? Now you exaggerate.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.199
The Irish do not want help.

34:50.239 --> 34:55.120
If Irish City Bank goes bankrupt,
so does Rheinthaler.

34:56.170 --> 35:03.060
Your government loses all credibility
if Germany's largest bank falls.

35:05.110 --> 35:10.220
Although they receive the aid package,
it does not save the bonds.

35:10.260 --> 35:16.140
No. That's why you
need friends like me.

35:16.180 --> 35:22.060
What do you want,
Dominic? You know that well.

35:22.100 --> 35:28.120
A drastic decline in growth in
the housing market. A chronic...

35:37.210 --> 35:39.080
RICHMOND POLITI

36:04.080 --> 36:07.030
Reach? Please trade stocks.

36:07.070 --> 36:11.210
The VaR adjusts
automatically to your orders.

36:14.060 --> 36:17.100
Massimo calls

36:17.140 --> 36:20.120
Massimo. How are you?

36:20.160 --> 36:25.160
What are you doing?
Little. It's a quiet day.

36:25.200 --> 36:31.110
Did you look at the bonds? Yes.
I didn't find anything interesting.

36:31.150 --> 36:34.200
What did you find? A high exposure.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.250
How much?

36:37.040 --> 36:43.050
Distributed across the major banks In France,
Germany and the Netherlands... five percent.

36:43.090 --> 36:46.100
5% Mostly at Rheinthaler Bank.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.120
Have I overlooked anything?

36:52.150 --> 36:55.110
We understand this by war:

36:55.150 --> 37:02.090
In 1956, England, France and Israel
attacked Egypt over the Suez Canal.

37:03.100 --> 37:08.210
4,000 people were killed
and nearly 5,000 were injured.

37:10.100 --> 37:14.050
The United States was
strongly opposed to the war

37:14.090 --> 37:20.020
but could badly attack an
ally. So what did they do?

37:21.260 --> 37:23.250
They attacked the British economy.

37:26.060 --> 37:33.020
Eisenhower forced US central bank
to sell billions Of British pounds.

37:33.060 --> 37:37.150
After a few weeks,
the currency was so weak

37:37.190 --> 37:42.060
that the British were forced
to withdraw their troops.

37:42.100 --> 37:46.120
The most powerful weapon of our time

37:46.160 --> 37:50.190
are not rifles, tanks or cannons.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.240
It's the financial world.

37:56.180 --> 38:01.090
How's my Oliver? He's
quick. Quick learner.

38:01.130 --> 38:06.190
As I expected. I see a
lot of potential in him.

38:08.210 --> 38:13.040
What do you know about
Irish bonds? What a timing.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.260
Milk? No thanks.

38:15.050 --> 38:18.020
They are about to implode.

38:19.170 --> 38:23.190
Rheinthaler Bank has invested
three billion euros in them.

38:23.230 --> 38:27.140
They were greedy. Instead
of lending to Germans

38:27.180 --> 38:30.250
who would buy a
house or start a company

38:31.040 --> 38:35.200
they invested in bonds that
everyone knew would implode.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.220
They make up 5% of banks' holdings.

38:38.260 --> 38:43.090
Why won't Dominic short
them? We have lowered the VaR.

38:43.130 --> 38:47.150
He keeps you short. He
must have his reasons.

38:47.190 --> 38:49.100
But which ones?

38:49.140 --> 38:54.100
We could make millions short
of the Irish if they go bankrupt.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.200
They are not going to go bankrupt.

39:02.040 --> 39:07.110
Someone guarantees the bonds.
I do not know anything about that.

39:07.150 --> 39:13.100
But the European Central
Bank meets in Dublin tonight.

39:13.140 --> 39:18.020
They cannot force the
Irish to save the bank

39:18.060 --> 39:23.190
to save the Germans. They can't.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.040
How are you? The
Raspberry is working on it.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.060
260 million so far.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.250
Came.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.060
Didn't you go home?

39:45.100 --> 39:48.110
Ask everyone to go a
long way on Irish bonds.

39:48.150 --> 39:50.200
But they are soon worthless.

39:50.240 --> 39:55.220
No, the Irish government
should guarantee them.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.040
They can't.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.210
Why should the Irish
go minus for a bank.

40:01.250 --> 40:04.200
They do not care. But
the Germans are not.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.100
Neither do France and the Netherlands.

40:08.190 --> 40:10.030
Pis. Yes.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.180
They will take advantage of the ECB.

40:12.220 --> 40:18.030
The ECB will force
Ireland to rescue the banks.

40:18.070 --> 40:21.030
They save the banks at
the expense of the people.

40:21.070 --> 40:24.180
They pay with pension,
salary and health care.

40:24.220 --> 40:27.240
The ECB chooses the cheapest solution.

40:28.030 --> 40:30.260
It is cheaper to save bondholders

40:31.050 --> 40:33.040
than some banks.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.260
They turn private debt
into public debt. It's robbery.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.230
Get started.

40:45.150 --> 40:47.050
I must confess something.

40:48.130 --> 40:50.190
We have shorted the bonds.

40:52.210 --> 40:55.100
I told you not to.

41:01.210 --> 41:03.040
All of you?

41:03.080 --> 41:08.040
I put a Raspberry PI on
the risk department network.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.200
What did you do? Sorry.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.190
Did you know about this?

41:15.210 --> 41:20.190
We forced Oliver to do
it. You broke Chris' VaR.

41:25.050 --> 41:31.030
How much have you sold? 260 million.

41:36.230 --> 41:40.060
You haven't been honest to us either.

41:40.100 --> 41:44.260
When would you tell the
cops think you murdered Ed?

41:52.040 --> 41:53.140
Where did you hear that?

41:56.170 --> 42:01.070
But that is absurd. Does not?

42:02.210 --> 42:05.020
It was Paul.

42:09.050 --> 42:12.160
Delete the short and go far Instead.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.050
Now.

42:32.080 --> 42:36.230
Bank executives, lawmakers
and the government have agreed

42:37.020 --> 42:38.260
after hard negotiations.

42:39.050 --> 42:44.050
Over the past 24 hours, the bank
has suffered major losses on equities.

42:44.090 --> 42:47.230
Many international
investors are troubled

42:48.020 --> 42:50.070
over the Irish economy.

42:50.110 --> 42:54.190
We will broadcast live
from the ECB's final order.

42:54.230 --> 42:56.230
To ensure stability

42:57.020 --> 43:00.200
the Irish government has
shown great responsibility

43:00.240 --> 43:06.110
and saved Irish Trader
Bank and other banks

43:06.150 --> 43:08.030
by taking them over.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.210
Come on. Back to work.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.140
Max, I'm speechless.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.030
Sorry.

43:32.070 --> 43:34.120
Nothing. Forgive

43:55.190 --> 43:58.170
I want to show you something.

44:09.150 --> 44:13.250
Your wife was arrested last
year in Virginia for prostitution.

44:16.030 --> 44:21.090
I put one on the case. He
said Carrie's files were deleted.

44:21.130 --> 44:25.140
A lawyer, William Trevor,
had locked them.

44:27.030 --> 44:31.060
You work for his biggest
customer. Dominic Morgan.

44:36.240 --> 44:42.210
She didn't call you. No.

44:48.180 --> 44:52.200
My brother raised me
when my parents died.

44:54.230 --> 44:59.110
He shot himself when I was little.

45:01.020 --> 45:06.120
I know what it feels
like to live with guilt.

45:12.070 --> 45:14.170
Why are you giving me this?

45:16.170 --> 45:21.140
You would know why
Ed Stuart died. I will too.

45:30.210 --> 45:36.130
Inquiry started at 19.36. Present
are Commissioner Bale, and Winks.

45:36.170 --> 45:42.130
Is that the case file? Mrs.
Stuart has found something more.

45:42.170 --> 45:48.060
Something her husband had been hiding
well. It's Ed Stuart's handwriting.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.260
It looks like bonds.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.260
Massimo Ruggero.

45:55.050 --> 45:56.140
Ask Ruggero!

45:58.050 --> 46:06.050
Massimo Ruggero.

46:09.220 --> 46:14.250
They're going to jail
for this. I can feel that.

46:35.220 --> 46:39.100
Chief, there is the telephone.
That's the prosecutor.

46:40.190 --> 46:44.090
Inquire interrupted at. 19.38.

47:27.250 --> 47:29.110
They can walk.

47:31.190 --> 47:33.170
The case has been transferred.

47:33.210 --> 47:37.220
What does it mean?
That you have high friends.

47:41.120 --> 47:44.160
I know you think I'm guilty.

47:45.260 --> 47:48.240
But you will find out you are wrong.

47:49.030 --> 47:54.180
If anything related to Ed's death,
I can interpret it for you.

47:58.210 --> 48:01.050
Let me see those papers.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.200
Go to hell!

48:07.260 --> 48:13.140
It is nice. I was impressed
by the debate in Ireland

48:13.180 --> 48:18.200
and of people's knowledge of
the complex economic crisis.

48:18.240 --> 48:23.170
When I drive by taxi from the airport

48:23.210 --> 48:28.080
the driver is often
very well-oriented.

48:43.180 --> 48:50.170
Klaus Masuch, did not tell the taxi
driver that the Irish did not understand

48:50.210 --> 48:57.070
why they have to pay billions
For non-guaranteed bonds

48:57.110 --> 49:02.100
for debts which the Irish have
by no means solved and part I

49:02.140 --> 49:07.150
just to ensure the solvency
of European banks?

49:07.190 --> 49:10.070
Can we take a couple at the same time?

49:10.110 --> 49:13.260
Please pass the microphone on.

49:14.050 --> 49:18.110
Why are the Irish forced
under ECB threats...

49:18.150 --> 49:21.130
Why should the Irish pay billions

49:21.170 --> 49:25.140
for non-guaranteed
bonds under ECB threats?

49:27.060 --> 49:30.230
They didn't respond last,
maybe you do now.

49:31.020 --> 49:34.050
He has no more to add.

49:34.090 --> 49:37.200
That is not good enough. Sorry.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.200
It is not good enough.
