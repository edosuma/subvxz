[Doc reading]

01:01.936 --> 01:04.855
Who's ready for our
big sleepover party?

01:05.230 --> 01:06.191
[all] We are!

01:07.525 --> 01:09.861
Oh, I love
sleepover parties.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.989
How do you all like
my fancy-pantsy
new pajamas?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.492
Lambie, those are prettier
than pumpkin pie!

01:16.242 --> 01:17.118
I know!

01:17.535 --> 01:19.370
What are we gonna do
at the party, Doc?

01:19.788 --> 01:24.334
We're gonna play games,
tell stories,
sleep in sleeping bags.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.212
And have
a pajama fashion show?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.298
Sure. [giggles]
And I have a surprise.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.967
Someone special
is coming to our party.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.427
A surprise?
Someone special?

01:34.969 --> 01:38.139
I'll give you a hint:
he's really brave.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.974
It must be me.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.977
Sorry, Stuffy, it's...

01:43.728 --> 01:44.938
[laughs]

01:45.897 --> 01:47.899
Sir Kirby!
It's you!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.401
Yes, 'tis I, Sir Kirby,

01:50.485 --> 01:53.738
the bravest knight in all
of McStuffins' kingdom.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.491
Donny said we could borrow
Sir Kirby for the night.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.285
M'ladies.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.912
[kisses]

02:00.995 --> 02:02.038
Oh, my.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.164
What a gentleman.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.292
Sir Kirby,
great to see you. [grunts]

02:06.376 --> 02:07.418
Yikes, that's hard.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.255
'Tis wonderful
to see you too,
friendly dragon.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.007
I am most delighted
to be here, friends,

02:13.299 --> 02:15.885
as it is my first
sleepover party ever.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.595
Oh, you'll love it.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.932
We're gonna play games,
snuggle in our sleeping bags.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.601
And turn off the lights
to tell stories!

02:23.935 --> 02:28.022
Oh. Uh, excuse me,
did you say
"turn off the lights"?

02:28.773 --> 02:29.691
Yes, why?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.776
Oh, why?
Well, um, you see,

02:31.860 --> 02:36.072
it just sounds
rather d-d-dangerous
to turn off the lights.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.825
We turn off the lights
every night
when we go to sleep.

02:39.117 --> 02:39.951
Don't you?

02:40.034 --> 02:41.619
Actually, no.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.913
When good King Donny
goes to sleep,

02:44.205 --> 02:46.666
he always keeps
a little light on
in his room.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.835
Huh.
Well, no lights here.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.837
[breathing heavily]

02:50.920 --> 02:52.589
Oh, dear.
Sir Kirby,

02:52.672 --> 02:56.301
you're breathing
really hard.
Are you okay?

02:56.759 --> 02:59.804
Oh, yes. Yes, I...
I am perfectly fine.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.765
Being brave
is just so, so tiring.

03:03.099 --> 03:03.933
Whew!

03:05.977 --> 03:07.979
Time for sleepover
party games.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.522
Let's do this.
All right.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.525
[all laughing]

03:24.537 --> 03:25.371
[giggling]

03:32.378 --> 03:33.630
[Sir Kirby] Oh, wonderful.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.550
I do say,
this sleepover party
is most delightful.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.095
Oh, it gets even better,
you handsome,
hopping knight.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.307
Time to snuggle up
and turn out the lights.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.892
[panting]

03:47.101 --> 03:51.064
M'lady, I must ask you
not to turn off that light.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.690
Why not?

03:52.774 --> 03:57.570
What? Well, um, you see,
I, uh... Let me think.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.823
I haven't done
my knightly check
of the room

04:00.907 --> 04:03.368
to make sure
there are no dragons here.
[chuckles]

04:03.451 --> 04:06.704
After all,
I need to keep fair
Princess Lambie safe, eh?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.872
[giggles]

04:08.289 --> 04:10.667
But I'm here,
and I'm a dragon.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.003
Indeed. However,
I meant mean dragons.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.172
Not nice ones like you.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.923
Here we are.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.052
Good news there.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.013
Ah!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.140
There are
no mean dragons here,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.726
nor are there
any scary monsters.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.228
[yawning]

04:32.939 --> 04:33.856
[screaming]

04:36.442 --> 04:37.568
[whimpering]

04:37.652 --> 04:40.196
Sir Kirby, are you okay?

04:40.697 --> 04:41.864
Yes, of course. I...

04:41.948 --> 04:44.867
I was just, um, keeping
Princess Lambie safe.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.703
Yes, that's it,
uh, keeping her safe

04:46.786 --> 04:48.496
from any mean dragons
that might, uh,

04:48.579 --> 04:50.331
you know,
fly in the window.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.003
Oh, you're really shaking.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.879
And breathing heavy, too.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.882
Yes, well, I...
I'm not feeling
very well at all.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.886
I feel, um, shaky and--
and sweaty, actually.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.140
Sir Kirby,
let me give you a checkup
and see what's wrong.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.809
Can you do it
with the lights on?

05:10.184 --> 05:11.311
Sure can, sweetie.

05:11.686 --> 05:15.523
Well, then, checkup away.
And, um, take your time.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.765
Sir Kirby, your heart
is beating really fast.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.224
That's why
you're so sweaty.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.935
Sometimes when someone
is breathing fast,

05:53.019 --> 05:56.481
and shaking and sweating,
it means they're scared.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
Is there anything
you're scared of?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.027
Me, scared?

06:01.652 --> 06:04.155
Need I remind you
that I am Sir Kirby,

06:04.238 --> 06:06.908
the bravest knight in all
of McStuffins' kingdom?

06:07.158 --> 06:10.119
Why, I have fought dragons,
saved princesses,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.121
and conquered evil kings!

06:12.497 --> 06:14.582
And that's all so amazing,

06:14.832 --> 06:17.418
but have you ever
been scared?

06:21.214 --> 06:26.052
The truth is, Doc,
when it's very dark,
I always feel like this.

06:26.385 --> 06:30.223
Shaky and sweaty.
I think I am scared.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.891
I think so, too.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.770
I have a diagnosis.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.607
You, sir,
have a severe case
of the Dark-willies.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.609
It means you're afraid
of the dark.

06:42.151 --> 06:45.655
But, how can a brave knight
be afraid of something?

06:46.447 --> 06:49.492
Are you sure
of your diagnosis,
Lady McStuffins?

06:49.826 --> 06:53.579
Yes. You're afraid
of the dark.
But everyone has...

06:53.663 --> 06:54.580
Say no more.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.750
Good friends
of McStuffins' kingdom,

06:57.834 --> 07:00.086
I am no longer
a brave knight.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.966
And I can no longer
be a part of this
sleepover party.

07:05.716 --> 07:06.884
Fare-thee-well.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.428
[sniffling] And goodbye.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.974
[sobbing]

07:13.599 --> 07:14.642
[Chilly] Don't go!
Don't go!

07:14.725 --> 07:15.768
But, Sir Kirby!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.479
Everyone gets scared
sometimes, Sir Kirby.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.858
You mean,
even brave knights
get scared?

07:22.191 --> 07:23.568
Even brave knights.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.446
We're your friends.
We'll help you.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.242
Greetings, friends.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.619
You need a royal cuddle.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.248
Oh, Lambie.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.584
You know,
I bet you'll feel better

07:39.667 --> 07:41.961
if we tell you
what we're afraid of.

07:42.044 --> 07:45.798
Yeah! Me, I'm afraid
of getting too hot,
getting too cold, melting,

07:45.882 --> 07:48.384
lost under the bed,
mistaken for a dog toy,

07:48.468 --> 07:52.054
being mistaken
for a baby toy, bananas,
uh, and pickles, and...

07:52.638 --> 07:54.807
Oh. [chuckles]
Well, you get the idea.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.059
I'm afraid of
hurting people's feelings.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.772
And polka dots.
I do not like polka dots.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.985
Well, I'm not
afraid of anything.
[grunts]

08:06.444 --> 08:07.695
Except for spiders.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.282
And I'm afraid of
thunder and lightning.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.326
That does make me
feel better.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.246
Good. Now,
to know how to treat you,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.791
I need to know
exactly what caused
your Dark-willies.

08:21.417 --> 08:25.588
Was there something
you saw that scared you
when the lights went out?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.548
Well, yes.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.385
When the darkness fell,
I saw something strange.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.388
Like a...
Like a scary monster.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.847
Right there.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.851
A scary monster?
I can't look.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.230
No monsters here.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.734
Maybe in the dark
that chair looks different.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.987
Will you be okay
if we turn out the lights
for just a second?

08:50.571 --> 08:51.405
If you must.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.201
I'll hold your hand, Sir Kirby.
Then you won't be so scared.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.245
M'lady.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.913
[whimpers]

08:59.247 --> 09:01.582
One, two, three.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.461
[breathing heavily]

09:05.545 --> 09:08.923
The monster, I see it.
Right there!

09:09.465 --> 09:11.676
[Doc] No, look,
it's not a monster.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.762
It's just the way the chair
and the jacket look
when it's dark.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.515
By Jove, you're right.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.895
And yet, I...
I still feel, eh...
strange.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.400
[rapid heartbeat]

09:27.483 --> 09:29.277
[Doc] Your heart is beating
kind of fast again.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.488
Your case of Dark-willies
hasn't been totally cured.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.255
If you get scared,
just squeeze it.

10:31.714 --> 10:36.218
M'lady, you are the kindest
and bravest princess I know.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.219
[giggles]

10:37.303 --> 10:40.723
Let's do this, folks.
It's telling stories
in the dark time.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.435
Okay, everyone,
let's count down.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.521
[all] Three, two, one.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.695
You know,
it's not too dark.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.073
I can see what everything is.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.533
That's not a monster,
it's a chair.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.620
I think my Dark-willies
are much better.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.955
[heart beating steadily]

11:05.039 --> 11:06.457
Yep,
you're totally calm.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.169
Your heartbeat slowed down,
and you're not
shaking anymore.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.712
[all] Hooray!

11:12.213 --> 11:14.590
A hundred thanks
to you all.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.010
Friends, toys, countrymen.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.765
Sir Kirby is back,
and ready
for the sleepover party!

11:23.224 --> 11:25.643
[Doc] Then let's get
into our sleeping bags.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.146
Oh, my, this is comfy.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.649
And it's not scary at all.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.903
[Stuffy] Oh!
Shadow puppets.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.282
Once upon a time,
there was a brave knight.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.284
[Stuffy] And he was
afraid of the dark.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.454
But, when he turned on
a little light...

11:46.205 --> 11:47.832
He wasn't afraid anymore.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.334
[Doc]
But he was sleepy.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.086
[toys yawning]

11:55.548 --> 11:57.091
Good night, Sir Kirby.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.260
Sir Kirby?

12:00.010 --> 12:00.970
[snoring]

12:01.053 --> 12:02.888
I'm not afraid of the dark.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.975
-[all giggling]
-[Doc] Shh!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.937
I think Sir Kirby is cured.
Night, everyone.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.148
[toys] Good night, Doc.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.987
[Doc reading]

12:18.779 --> 12:20.072
[Doc] Everybody, hide.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.200
One, two...

12:24.785 --> 12:28.080
Three, four...

12:29.707 --> 12:30.708
Five...

12:31.125 --> 12:32.710
Chilly, hide.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.170
[Doc] Six...
I am.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.505
Doc is gonna think
I'm a real snowman...
[Doc] Seven...

12:36.589 --> 12:37.882
and walk right by me.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.176
[Doc] Eight...
A real snowman,
just standing there

12:40.259 --> 12:42.094
in the middle
of a summer day?
[Doc] Nine...

12:42.178 --> 12:43.596
Exactly.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.265
[Doc] Ten! Ready or not,
here I come.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.019
Hi, Chilly. Found you.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.397
Wow, Doc!
That was amazing.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.274
You're not only great
at fixing toys,

12:55.357 --> 12:57.443
you are great
at finding them, too.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.652
[giggling]

12:58.736 --> 13:00.488
Just lucky, I guess.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.241
I wonder where
everyone's hiding.
[gasps] Oh!

13:04.325 --> 13:06.076
[screams] Spider!

13:06.785 --> 13:08.287
[groaning]

13:08.787 --> 13:09.872
What happened?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.373
Sorry, Chilly.

13:11.457 --> 13:16.921
There was a huge, monstrous,
dragon-eating-sized
spider in there.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.426
You mean that
tiny little spider
right there?

13:23.219 --> 13:26.430
Well, he could eat me
if he had enough time.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.432
[groaning]

13:29.141 --> 13:30.434
Are you okay?

13:30.726 --> 13:33.395
Stuffy, Doc, is that you?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.648
I think
I need an ambulance.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.024
I got you covered.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.694
Doc,
everything looks blue.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.532
That's the sky.
You're looking up
at the blue sky.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.825
One ambulance
at your service.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.329
Thanks.
Chilly, I think you're fine.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.623
But if it'll
make you feel better,

13:52.706 --> 13:55.709
we can go to the clinic
for a checkup, just to be sure.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.796
Oh, that will definitely
make me feel better.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.718
Everybody, come on out.
Game's over.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.470
Is everything okay, Doc?

14:06.887 --> 14:08.138
Sorry, guys.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.517
Chilly got knocked down,
so I'm gonna
give him a checkup.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.354
Aw! I had a wicked good
hiding place.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.940
But I'll never tell
where it is.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.110
It's okay, Hermie.
We can play
a little bit later.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.029
Has anyone seen Hallie?

14:24.488 --> 14:26.240
Don't know.
I couldn't see anything

14:26.323 --> 14:29.660
while I was hiding
in the sand... box.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.955
No. I said too much,
didn't I?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.206
[squeaking]

14:34.874 --> 14:36.792
Don't worry, Doc.
We'll find her.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.379
All right, everybody,
follow the dragon.

14:42.047 --> 14:46.010
Dragons use
their strong sense
of sight, smell...

14:46.093 --> 14:48.470
[sniffing]
And hearing to find...

14:48.554 --> 14:50.222
[yells]
There she is.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.143
What did I tell you?
Dragons are great
at finding things.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.854
You can come on out,
Hallie.
Game's over.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.105
Oh!

14:58.314 --> 15:00.900
You found me. Coming out.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.902
[grunting]

15:03.235 --> 15:07.531
Or trying to,
but I'm stuck in here
like a bug in a rug.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.826
Dragons are also
excellent unstuckers.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.538
[grunting]

15:16.582 --> 15:20.377
Blazing bumblebees!
Am I the last one
to be found?

15:20.753 --> 15:21.837
Well, you did...

15:21.921 --> 15:25.382
How about that?
I won! I won! I won! I won!

15:26.216 --> 15:28.636
Actually, Hallie,
nobody won.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.597
We had to stop the game
to give Chilly here
a checkup.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.807
[groaning]

15:34.224 --> 15:36.101
You didn't
hear me calling?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.313
Calling?
No, I didn't hear a thing.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
Did you all hear
Doc calling?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.945
-I think even the dog
next door heard it.
-[dog barking]

15:46.278 --> 15:47.780
[squeaking]

15:48.739 --> 15:52.576
Guess my hiding place
was too far away
for me to hear anything.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.328
Now if you'll excuse me,

15:56.372 --> 15:58.707
there's a certain snowman
who needs our help.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.547
Doc, if I don't make it,

16:05.881 --> 16:08.676
I want you
to have my collection
of snow globes.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.178
And let Hallie have my hat.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.682
I know how much
she always loved this hat.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.977
Chilly,
you're gonna need your hat
and your snow globes

16:18.060 --> 16:19.645
because you're gonna be fine.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.564
I'll have you back
to hide-and-seeking
in no time.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.984
Hallie, may I have
the otoscope, please?

16:30.990 --> 16:31.907
Here you go.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.285
Uh... the otoscope,
please?

16:35.703 --> 16:38.580
The what-a-what?
You got to speak up, Doc.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.875
Oh, the otoscope.
Here you go.

16:42.459 --> 16:45.379
Thanks, Hallie.
Are your ears feeling okay?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.257
Sometimes ears
can get clogged.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.928
Frog?
I know toys can break
in all kinds of ways,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.598
but I can tell you,
there's no frog in my ear.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.562
Doc, I'm worried
about Hallie's hearing.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.190
Me, too.
Let me just finish
Chilly's checkup.

17:08.484 --> 17:09.987
Looking good, Chilly.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.782
Now let's do
a quick check for any rips,
and you'll be good to go.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.242
Rips? I knew it.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.368
[Stuffy] Whoa!

17:17.828 --> 17:20.705
Oh! I'm probably
leaking stuffing right now.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.791
I'll be just like
an old sock with a hat.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.419
[Stuffy] Whoa!

17:25.711 --> 17:27.003
Watch out, Hallie!

17:27.087 --> 17:28.130
[gasps] Hallie!

17:31.050 --> 17:33.093
Hallie,
didn't you hear Stuffy?

17:33.177 --> 17:37.431
No. I guess
these ol' hippo ears
aren't working so well.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.476
We both could've been
scrambled like eggs.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.770
All because
I couldn't hear you.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.774
I'm okay, Hallie.
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.650
Do you need a cuddle?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.489
It's okay.
Chilly's checkup
is all done.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.949
So, I can check
your ears now.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.621
Yeah! Doc will fix you
so you can hear a dragon
coming a mile away.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.874
Or a hide-and-seek call.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.709
Or a cuddle call.

18:06.168 --> 18:10.214
[chuckles] I'll fix 'em
so you can hear all kinds
of cool things.

I'm supposed to be a nurse,
not a patient.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.807
Everybody needs
a doctor sometimes.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.061
Besides, hearing tests
are kind of like a game.
We'll have fun.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.440
We'll have gum?
You know sugary gum
is not good for your teeth.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.026
Not gum. Fun!

19:13.110 --> 19:14.862
[chuckling]
Oh!

19:15.362 --> 19:17.865
Well, in that case,
let's do it.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.617
All you have to do
is close your eyes

19:20.909 --> 19:23.579
and raise your hand when
you hear Squeakers squeak.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.081
Ready as a rooster
at sunrise, Doc!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.375
Uh-oh! I can't
hear Squeakers.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.335
I think I need
a doctor again.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.338
Chilly,
we haven't squeaked yet.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.091
And besides,
the test is for Hallie.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.469
Whew! I heard that.
[chuckles] Never mind.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.514
[squeaking]

19:43.473 --> 19:44.391
[squeaking]

19:45.184 --> 19:46.643
How am I doing, Doc?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.228
Great.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.939
-[scat singing]
-[squeaking]

19:52.941 --> 19:53.775
Stuffy?

19:54.860 --> 19:55.903
-Too much?
-[squeaking]

19:56.236 --> 19:57.404
Whoo-wee!

19:57.487 --> 20:01.491
Doc's gonna have to check
my heart after that,
not just my ears!

20:01.950 --> 20:04.161
Thanks, Stuffy.
I'll take it from here.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.078
Mmm-hmm.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.205
-Bye.
-[squeaks]

20:06.288 --> 20:07.247
Mm-hmm.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.540
[squeaking softly]

20:14.004 --> 20:17.549
Go on, Doc.
I'm getting gray hippo hairs
waiting for you to squeak.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.886
You're all done
with your test.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.513
Huh? So I passed the test?

20:23.972 --> 20:25.891
Actually, you didn't.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.310
There were some squeaks
you couldn't hear.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.271
It's like your ears
are clogged up
or something.

20:31.772 --> 20:32.648
Clogged up?

20:33.065 --> 20:36.318
Yep. Once my ears
got clogged up
on an airplane.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.112
I could
hardly hear anything
for a whole day.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.614
What did you do?

20:40.697 --> 20:42.866
I yawned and
that unclogged them.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.994
[yawning]

20:48.413 --> 20:49.915
Did it work?

20:49.998 --> 20:50.916
What did you say?

20:51.375 --> 20:55.128
It sounds like we need
to do something else
to unclog Hallie's ears.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.297
Yep.
Let's take a look.

20:58.382 --> 21:02.094
Uh-oh! I think I know why
you can't hear very well.

21:02.177 --> 21:06.348
I have a diagnosis.
You have Ear-stuffin-osis.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.434
That means
there's extra stuffing
in your ear.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.854
Huh? An extra muffin
in my ear?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.148
Oh! Why,
that's just ridiculous.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.026
[chuckling]
Not muffin, stuffing!

21:18.360 --> 21:22.531
Mmm. I suppose I am
a bit fluffier than usual.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.033
-[grunting]
-[squeaks]

21:25.409 --> 21:26.326
Careful, sugar.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.538
There's enough
boo-boos in that book
to give you a boo-boo.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.582
Ooh!
Let the brave dragon help.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.959
Oh, okay.

21:34.042 --> 21:34.960
Ow! Aah! Ooh!

21:35.502 --> 21:37.587
Aw! Sorry, Stuffy.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.466
When there's too much
fluff in your ears,

21:41.758 --> 21:43.719
the sound
can't get through.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.138
I'm gonna have
to unstuff it.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.389
[Hallie] I'm ready, Doc.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.227
Do what you got to do.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.609
There. It's really important
to clean out the fluff
every now and then,

21:59.860 --> 22:01.695
before it plugs up
your ears.

22:02.112 --> 22:02.946
Ohh!

22:03.030 --> 22:05.449
Doc! Say that again!

22:05.907 --> 22:10.162
It's important
to clean out fluff before
it plugs up your ears?

22:10.495 --> 22:12.956
Ha! That's what
I thought you said.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.794
I could hear a ladybug
landing on a leaf
with all that stuffing gone!

22:20.005 --> 22:23.133
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so much better ♪</span>

22:23.383 --> 22:26.678
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Thank you, Doc</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For taking all the ouches away ♪</span>

22:26.762 --> 22:28.055
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Didn't feel so good ♪</span>

22:28.138 --> 22:31.516
<span style="style.default_1">Till you fixed me like</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I knew that you would ♪</span>

22:31.725 --> 22:36.730
<span style="style.default_1">♪ And I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better now ♪</span>

22:37.564 --> 22:40.192
Hey! Now that
Hallie and Chilly
are all better,

22:40.525 --> 22:41.902
why don't we play a game?

22:42.277 --> 22:45.197
We never did finish
hide-and-go-seek.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.157
Oh, yeah.
I love that game.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.659
You toys
better start hiding

22:49.743 --> 22:53.288
'cause this hippo's
gonna use her eyes
and ears to find you.

22:53.371 --> 22:57.209
One, two, three, four,

22:57.584 --> 23:03.215
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.801
Ready or not, here I come.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.720
[chuckling]

23:08.804 --> 23:09.846
Hiya, Chilly.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.266
Wow! You are really good
at this game, too.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.104
[giggling softly]

23:17.938 --> 23:19.815
[sing-song voice]
I heard that.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.566
Found you.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.318
[all laughing]

23:23.401 --> 23:24.402
Got you.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.947
Hey, where's Hermie?

23:27.030 --> 23:28.323
[tapping]

23:28.406 --> 23:29.825
There he is.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.284
[all laughing]

23:32.953 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.290
<span style="style.default_1">Luca got a splinter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in his finger.</span>
Ow!

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you get a splinter?</span>

23:39.918 --> 23:40.961
Stomp! Stomp!

23:41.044 --> 23:44.005
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play Dragon Stomp</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and knock down all your blocks?</span>

23:46.341 --> 23:49.427
<span style="style.default_1">Should you tell an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so they can remove</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the splinter?</span>

23:50.262 --> 23:53.515
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of Throw Cotton Balls</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at Stuffy's Tummy?</span>

23:55.225 --> 23:58.353
<span style="style.default_1">That's right. Get an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to remove the splinter.</span>
