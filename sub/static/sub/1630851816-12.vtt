WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

02:02.747 --> 02:03.581
I found a photo.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.554
What's that for?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.390
Let's drink this before we go.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.444
Do you just have to boil it like this?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.157
Yes. That's it.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
Were you surprised
that I wanted to see you?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.248
A little.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.212
You take after her a lot.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.008
Your mother.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.264
The resemblance is striking.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.103
Go to Saju.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.648
That's all I wanted to say to you.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.858
Saju?

03:12.483 --> 03:13.359
Yeah.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.863
That's your mom's hometown, after all.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.244
And he's there, too.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.212
You know,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.589
your grandmother was a beauty.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.758
I was going to say that, too.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.567
What is that?

04:40.071 --> 04:40.905
Paying my tab.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.033
Your grandma

04:46.077 --> 04:48.413
wouldn't accept my money
for the <i>jajangmyeon</i> I ate.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.458
I was going to repay her
twice as much later

04:52.542 --> 04:53.876
after I got a job.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.864
<i>When you see the representative,
you'll recognize him.</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:07.075
<i>You can avenge your boss' death</i>

06:07.700 --> 06:09.952
<i>by killing him, all right?</i>

06:13.998 --> 06:15.333
What the heck is this?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.377
Just make your way in there
and arrest Lim In-gwan.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.712
There are too many people.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
We can't get through the door.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.758
This is a big headache.
Who tipped them off?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.011
What is he doing? Stop them!

06:33.684 --> 06:34.936
Hello?

06:35.019 --> 06:36.813
Hyung-in, it's me.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.023
-Where are you?
-Me?

06:40.691 --> 06:41.818
Where do you think I would be?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.948
It pains me to be here.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.741
What did you say?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.786
How could there be so few people
at the funeral parlor?

06:52.411 --> 06:54.288
Very sad.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.251
I'm hanging up. I'm going to offer
my condolences to the family.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.049
Everyone. At last,

07:49.594 --> 07:50.845
Guru has returned

07:52.430 --> 07:54.307
to the Land of Promise.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.145
When he arrives here,

08:01.063 --> 08:02.273
we will

08:04.400 --> 08:05.318
all reach

08:06.944 --> 08:08.404
the new future.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.590
Hello.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.800
-Hi, go in.
-Oh, thank you.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.804
Hold on a minute.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.848
-Yes?
-Let me check the schedule.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.394
There's no food delivery
scheduled for today.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.647
Oh, well…

08:58.412 --> 09:01.207
What are you doing?
Aren't you getting off?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.532
Once you drink that,

09:34.615 --> 09:36.784
we will all join Guru

09:38.077 --> 09:39.704
without any pain or fear.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.483
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:43.059
Thank you for coming.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.061
Jo Jae-young,

10:45.895 --> 10:47.146
it's very tragic, isn't it?

10:49.857 --> 10:51.734
Can I ask you

10:52.860 --> 10:55.363
how you know my grandma?

10:58.407 --> 11:01.327
We weren't able to
notify many people about the funeral.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.456
Yes, I know.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.460
It's sad how she died.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.589
You must be in grief.

11:15.007 --> 11:15.925
I'm just

11:16.717 --> 11:20.930
an old friend of your aunt, Jung-hyun.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.272
Take the cup, Successor.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.859
What? Are you afraid?

11:43.828 --> 11:44.662
Everyone.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.832
Are you afraid?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.709
Do you still feel

11:51.794 --> 11:53.587
fear as we follow

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
Guru's teachings?

11:58.467 --> 12:01.137
Is it because of this woman
who is called the successor?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.181
I learned that she

12:05.015 --> 12:06.934
put on a show before you.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.146
It's very insulting.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.982
The fact that she believes

12:13.816 --> 12:16.861
she can sway your beliefs
with sweet words.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.573
What the heck is she to us?

12:22.950 --> 12:25.870
What can she do for us?

12:27.037 --> 12:30.249
What has she done until now?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.295
Open your eyes and look around.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.841
Who is going to join you
in our new future?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.969
Guru has no fear whatsoever.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.846
He'll always be with you.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.849
And Guru

12:49.185 --> 12:50.352
will never

12:52.646 --> 12:54.607
act cowardly in the face of death.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.989
That is the only truth, everyone.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.503
Mister.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.462
You're here?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.924
What the hell do you think you're doing?

13:24.053 --> 13:26.055
That's a nice welcome.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.307
How can I talk if you act so hostile?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.017
-You want to talk?
-Yeah.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.979
-I came to tell you something.
-You.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.148
You have some nerve.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.942
Do I?

13:38.442 --> 13:41.278
After you hear what I have to say,
you'll understand why I came.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.537
I'll get straight to the point.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.496
Hyung-in.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.706
He has returned.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.877
Guru is waiting to meet you.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.589
You have to come now.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.924
If you don't hurry,

14:03.467 --> 14:04.760
Jung-hyun will probably

14:07.721 --> 14:09.139
die today.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.188
Speak, Jung-hyun.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.024
Go ahead and wag your tongue like a snob.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.945
Talk to them, you snake.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.617
I don't have anything to say.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.042
All right.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.963
Get lost.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.466
You don't have the right
to be in this sacred place.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.638
Run away from here
and live like an insect.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.702
Look at her. That's an insect
whose soul cannot be saved.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.624
How pathetic is she?
She's running away like a coward.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.675
There's nothing pathetic

15:28.928 --> 15:30.471
about wanting to live.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.807
Yes, life can be painful.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.978
Sometimes it's terribly hard to go on.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.690
But losing the will to live

15:42.608 --> 15:45.527
isn't the way to remember

15:48.405 --> 15:50.282
your loved ones who have died.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.328
We must continue living

15:55.162 --> 15:57.957
no matter how lonely and tough life is

15:58.624 --> 16:00.250
to remember them.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.171
Even if you feel like you're paralyzed.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.173
Even if

16:07.549 --> 16:08.884
our lives

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
are full of more pain and anguish

16:15.641 --> 16:16.934
than the moment we lost our families.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.770
Everyone.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.690
Don't give up on your lives

16:25.734 --> 16:27.152
no matter the pain.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.036
Let's go home.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.975
Falsehoods!

17:04.148 --> 17:06.150
You pretend to know our pain,
but you don't.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.404
You can't save our souls with such words.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.949
Fine, Jung-hyun.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.202
If you want to save them,
then you must pay the consequences.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.247
Prove to everyone here
what you can do for them.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.582
Otherwise,

17:22.332 --> 17:23.333
nobody will be allowed

17:24.001 --> 17:25.627
to leave this room.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.725
Promise me

17:41.602 --> 17:43.520
that it'll end with me
if I accept the consequences.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.608
And Young-seob, I owe you an apology, too.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.237
For forgetting you.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.782
I'm sorry.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.166
Everyone,

18:08.045 --> 18:08.921
let's all go home.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.007
It's time to return home.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.772
What do you mean by that?

18:29.066 --> 18:31.443
How will my aunt die? What are you saying?

18:31.527 --> 18:32.945
Jae-young, calm down.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.613
You don't need to listen to him.

18:37.282 --> 18:41.578
He said my aunt is in danger.
How can I be calm in this situation?

18:43.163 --> 18:44.540
Jae-young, calm down a bit.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.583
I've got a generous heart.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.585
I know you're very worried.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.880
And there's a way to save your aunt

18:52.840 --> 18:55.050
and for me to get what I want.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.135
It's simple.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.761
Jae-young, go to where your aunt is.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.515
And Hyung-in, go and meet Guru.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.602
Right now. It's pretty simple, eh?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.022
Let's go.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.072
Jae-young, nothing will happen
to your aunt.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.365
She's not going to die.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.742
I promise. Trust me, okay?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.369
-So Jae-young…
-Why?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.122
Why do you believe she'll be safe?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.417
Mister, you wouldn't care

19:29.334 --> 19:32.045
what happens to my aunt. Isn't that so?

19:32.129 --> 19:33.213
Jae-young.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.008
How can you promise

19:37.467 --> 19:39.720
that nothing will happen to my aunt?

19:41.096 --> 19:44.183
How can you say such irresponsible things?
Why on earth would you say that?

19:50.814 --> 19:51.773
Why

19:54.943 --> 19:56.069
do you still

19:57.279 --> 19:59.740
not see the truth?

20:01.825 --> 20:02.868
What?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.621
I can't leave my aunt alone.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.583
I have to see with my own two eyes

20:10.417 --> 20:11.710
if my aunt

20:12.336 --> 20:13.462
is alive.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.915
What did you mean by that earlier?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.292
That I can't see the truth.

20:53.085 --> 20:53.919
I'm sorry.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.672
I don't want to talk about it right now.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.298
Mister.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.135
Yeah?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.304
I

21:05.555 --> 21:07.391
want to have blood sausage stew.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.020
Our family can't go out to eat,
so I've never had it.

21:13.563 --> 21:17.234
Will you treat me
to blood sausage stew next time?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.362
Sure.

21:22.781 --> 21:23.782
Jae-young.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.034
Let's do that.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.391
Are you okay?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.184
She needs to be taken to a hospital.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.813
What do you think you're doing
at this important hour?

21:56.606 --> 21:57.983
Take her away!

21:58.066 --> 22:00.360
She's going to die anyway.
Get her out of my sight!

22:04.823 --> 22:06.908
Master Jung, what the heck are you doing?

22:07.743 --> 22:08.618
We've decided

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
to live.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.544
Oh gosh.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.219
What? Brings back old memories?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.306
But we don't have time for this.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.855
Why on earth won't you believe me?

24:42.981 --> 24:44.357
I'm the only one

24:46.318 --> 24:47.819
who has followed his teachings

24:49.487 --> 24:53.617
for my entire life.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.288
Why won't you trust me?

25:00.290 --> 25:01.750
You're all just like her.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.960
You're pathetic.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.965
You're mere insects.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.469
Do you think his plan

25:13.678 --> 25:16.097
will change because of what you're doing?

25:17.641 --> 25:18.600
No.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.437
We will

25:23.855 --> 25:25.065
all find

25:25.690 --> 25:28.401
salvation here together.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.905
Don't disobey me!

25:33.240 --> 25:36.618
He is coming so get ready!

25:42.165 --> 25:43.416
What is happening?

25:51.716 --> 25:52.717
All right.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.179
There's no stopping the plan.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.351
We will all become his worker ants.

26:24.040 --> 26:24.874
Is everything

26:26.418 --> 26:27.836
going as you wanted?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.174
As I wanted?

26:33.258 --> 26:36.428
I was involved in the torture
and death of your father.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.596
Now you have me sitting
right across from you.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.849
Isn't this what you wanted?

26:43.685 --> 26:44.936
The incident I forgot

26:46.396 --> 26:48.982
was something I shouldn't
have forgotten no matter what.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.445
It's my fault that

26:54.195 --> 26:55.572
all of this has happened, eh?

26:57.073 --> 26:59.200
And as long as I'm alive,

27:00.285 --> 27:02.746
your hatred will never subside.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.001
So let's end this here.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.546
So what is your point?

27:11.629 --> 27:13.048
You're going back to prison.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.508
You'll rot there
for the rest of your life.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.719
In return, I'll give my life.

27:18.928 --> 27:19.929
Let's end this.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.891
I'll be free from this nightmarish life.

27:23.683 --> 27:26.644
And you'll get the revenge
you've always wanted.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.729
How about that, Kyung-ho?

27:30.815 --> 27:33.026
You made up your mind before coming, huh?

27:34.444 --> 27:37.697
Look, you don't understand
anything I've said.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.699
Mr. Choi Hyung-in,

27:39.783 --> 27:42.118
you are not capable of
making any decisions.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.287
Your future is already

27:45.080 --> 27:45.997
predetermined.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.249
That day…

27:48.333 --> 27:50.835
October 6, 1987.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.506
After release the nerve gas
at Saju Station,

27:54.589 --> 27:57.175
I came straight to your home.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.178
I was going to kill you.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.596
I thought that

28:03.848 --> 28:05.892
would free myself from a future memory

28:05.975 --> 28:07.685
that was bothering me.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.938
A future memory?

28:10.021 --> 28:11.648
My predetermined future.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.651
But when I arrived at your house,

28:14.734 --> 28:17.779
I couldn't summon the courage to kill you.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.697
Because I discovered this in your kitchen.

28:30.917 --> 28:34.838
A letter that your late wife,
Lim Se-yoon left

28:35.672 --> 28:37.298
for you to read.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.010
What?

28:41.094 --> 28:43.179
So I accepted my fate.

28:44.931 --> 28:48.393
I could not avoid this moment

28:50.395 --> 28:52.397
where you and I confront
the truth in this room.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.484
My wife

28:57.444 --> 28:58.945
wrote me a letter?

28:59.612 --> 29:03.408
Yes, and she mentioned something here
that you couldn't know about.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.620
How dare you!

29:11.791 --> 29:14.919
Mr. Choi Hyung-in, calm down. Sit down.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.797
I haven't even started yet.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.218
This gun is loaded.

29:22.302 --> 29:27.140
And before you came here,
your gun was confiscated. Right?

29:27.807 --> 29:28.808
Now,

29:30.185 --> 29:32.771
I'll let you read the letter.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.442
And I'll also give you

29:38.651 --> 29:39.903
this gun.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.453
Kyung-ho! You bastard!
What kind of nonsense is this?

29:50.246 --> 29:52.457
I don't understand.
You have nothing to lose.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.667
And I just told you earlier.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.504
All my life,

29:59.339 --> 30:01.382
I've feared and waited

30:02.967 --> 30:05.345
for this very moment.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.848
Even if I tried to ignore it,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.686
the more I would want it in a weird way.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.652
And it's also the case for her.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.739
-Her?
-Jo Jae-young.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.452
Read the letter.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.164
Everything you need to know is there.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.147
Where is my aunt?

30:59.065 --> 31:01.359
This wasn't what you said. Where is she?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.069
I'm thinking about

31:03.778 --> 31:06.322
converting this whole place
into a nursing home.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.617
It'll be a relaxing place
for rich retirees

31:09.701 --> 31:13.496
where the air is clean
and there's a cool breeze.

31:14.747 --> 31:18.710
What do you think? Boosting my image
as contributing to society.

31:21.629 --> 31:26.426
In order to do that, I'll have to
completely get rid of the Youngjin Sect.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.846
So what will it take to do that?

31:31.556 --> 31:33.308
I'd have to kill the two people

31:34.142 --> 31:35.351
who are related to Guru.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.062
That would be Jo Jung-hyun

31:38.146 --> 31:40.106
and you, Jo Jae-young.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.026
You can't be too careful in life.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.369
You can't leave any loose ends.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.917
Now Jae-young, don't be sad.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.629
If Choi Hyung-in were here,
things could be worse.

32:06.716 --> 32:07.634
Both sides

32:09.093 --> 32:12.347
are very cruel, don't you think?

32:52.512 --> 32:55.181
<i>I'm writing this brief letter to you.</i>

32:57.183 --> 33:01.896
<i>Maybe, we could have had
a lot more time together.</i>

33:03.231 --> 33:07.402
<i>I think we should've cherished
the time we had.</i>

33:08.945 --> 33:12.198
<i>We should have loved each other more</i>

33:13.199 --> 33:14.075
<i>and</i>

33:15.201 --> 33:17.036
<i>remembered the good times.</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:26.963
<i>There are things in life
that cannot be undone.</i>

33:27.964 --> 33:30.758
<i>Matters where someone must be held</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:32.552
<i>accountable for</i>

33:33.594 --> 33:36.347
<i>inexcusable acts.</i>

33:37.515 --> 33:38.808
<i>And I've</i>

33:40.184 --> 33:42.395
<i>decided to not shy away from it.</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:49.652
<i>So I hope you won't be hurt</i>

33:51.571 --> 33:53.364
<i>by what I will say next.</i>

34:04.208 --> 34:05.668
<i>I didn't lose our baby</i>

34:07.795 --> 34:09.338
<i>by a miscarriage.</i>

34:10.256 --> 34:12.383
<i>I lied to you about it</i>

34:14.052 --> 34:15.845
<i>and went to Japan to be away from you.</i>

34:16.679 --> 34:21.225
<i>I did that because I thought
I'd lose our baby if I didn't get away.</i>

34:22.852 --> 34:25.271
<i>But it didn't go according to my plan.</i>

34:26.397 --> 34:28.357
<i>No matter where I went,</i>

34:28.983 --> 34:29.942
<i>I couldn't escape</i>

34:30.777 --> 34:33.196
<i>from Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

34:35.031 --> 34:37.116
<i>So I chose the only way that</i>

34:37.992 --> 34:39.869
<i>could keep our baby safe.</i>

34:41.287 --> 34:42.622
<i>Despite knowing that</i>

34:43.498 --> 34:46.417
<i>you would never agree to it
if I had told you.</i>

34:48.419 --> 34:49.796
<i>Our baby</i>

34:50.713 --> 34:51.798
<i>is with</i>

34:53.174 --> 34:54.842
<i>Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

34:56.552 --> 34:58.137
<i>Please look after</i>

34:59.514 --> 35:00.973
<i>our daughter.</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:04.018
<i>And dear.</i>

35:05.019 --> 35:06.395
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:07.730 --> 35:09.315
<i>I don't have any regrets.</i>

35:10.274 --> 35:13.986
<i>These are the things
I've wanted to tell you.</i>

35:43.015 --> 35:45.309
Mr. Choi Hyung-in, wait a minute.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.061
If you shoot me now,

35:49.063 --> 35:51.399
you won't be able to hear
the rest of what I have to say.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.654
Decide what to do
after you hear me out. It's not too late.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.949
Because we're just getting started.

36:09.083 --> 36:12.920
Do you know the trouble
I had to go through to get this far?

36:13.004 --> 36:16.841
I had to dupe Choi Hyung-in and Jung-hyun
to finally get to you.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.885
It was so much trouble.

36:19.468 --> 36:24.098
I even texted your friends,
pretending to be you to pull this off.

36:26.642 --> 36:27.935
It was you.

36:28.644 --> 36:32.106
That's right. I had it all planned out.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.443
In a few minutes,
I'm going to get a call from Guru.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.778
Then everything will be over.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.824
Everyone will die.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.827
And I'll be the only survivor.

36:56.797 --> 37:00.760
Jae-young knows that you're her father.

37:02.511 --> 37:03.763
But why

37:05.473 --> 37:08.309
didn’t she tell you? Think about that.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.901
When I met you for the first time,

37:18.736 --> 37:21.572
I hypnotized you.

37:24.116 --> 37:27.912
I ordered you to kill the person you love
and then commit suicide.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.998
You know what happened in this town.

37:32.041 --> 37:35.002
Try to remember the murder-suicides
that happened here.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.171
My experiment was a success.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.091
Do you know what that means?

37:41.384 --> 37:44.303
You have to quickly make a decision.
You're running out of time.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.266
Either go and kill your daughter
right away

37:49.016 --> 37:51.978
or kill yourself here
before that can happen.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.650
What will it be?

37:59.527 --> 38:00.403
But

38:01.153 --> 38:03.030
I came prepared.

38:04.782 --> 38:09.120
It could be your last hope in some ways.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.622
It's your choice to make.

38:13.124 --> 38:18.337
I can erase your memory so that
you won't remember

38:20.256 --> 38:22.842
that Jae-young is your daughter.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.685
I think it has begun.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.353
Oh, those boys.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.813
I told them to only release the nerve gas.

39:17.897 --> 39:21.984
It's supposed to look like a mass suicide.
Why the hell are they shooting?

39:22.068 --> 39:25.196
-Someone has to clean up the mess.
-Should I go and check the situation?

39:25.279 --> 39:27.823
Yeah. Go and help with the cleanup.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.325
Getting rid of the bodies
will be a lot of work.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.994
Oh gosh. How sad.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.872
Seems like your aunt
will be waiting for you on the other side.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.170
I'll get you!

39:41.253 --> 39:42.630
I'll never forgive you!

39:44.965 --> 39:47.134
Can you handle her alone?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.303
Whoa. Jae-young.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.097
She's really scary.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.223
Look at her eyes.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.309
She's got the same fire like Jung-hyun.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.728
I'll be fine. Go help them out.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.647
She and I have to take a phone call.

40:12.952 --> 40:13.953
All right.

40:17.081 --> 40:17.915
Mr. Choi Hyung-in.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.543
We're running out of time.

40:21.585 --> 40:26.006
If you get eaten by the ants,
we can't reverse it.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.426
You just have to say one sentence.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.429
"Erase my memory."

40:32.847 --> 40:33.931
Just those words.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.648
If you don't say it,

40:45.109 --> 40:47.736
then I'll make a phone call

40:47.820 --> 40:50.823
and have Jae-young brought to this house.

40:52.658 --> 40:54.076
In that case,

40:55.327 --> 40:56.495
you'll kill her

40:58.414 --> 41:00.040
with your own hands,

41:01.375 --> 41:03.627
and then you'll kill yourself. Tragically.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.780
Hurry up and decide. There's no time.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.214
Wait.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.040
Did you decide?

42:25.417 --> 42:27.628
Do you want me to erase your memory?

42:56.782 --> 42:58.450
All right.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.329
Say those words.

43:04.164 --> 43:05.457
That you want me to erase them.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.295
So that you can escape from this place.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.428
You're no different
from the others, right?

43:21.432 --> 43:22.474
Hurry up and end it.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.020
You'll forget everything

43:27.688 --> 43:29.565
and I'll reach the end of my future.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.529
Hurry up and say it.

43:39.283 --> 43:40.326
Jae-young.

43:43.871 --> 43:46.540
The fact that she is my daughter.

43:49.543 --> 43:52.796
Now that I know that fact,

43:57.468 --> 43:58.844
I don't want to forget that.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.984
What do you think you're doing?

44:20.449 --> 44:21.950
You're quite amazing.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.912
Or maybe you don't understand.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.917
If you shoot me,

44:31.085 --> 44:33.045
you'll be trapped
in that hallucination forever.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.757
And you'll eventually

44:37.883 --> 44:39.968
kill your daughter.

44:42.888 --> 44:43.764
I never…

44:46.642 --> 44:48.310
I never want to forget that

44:50.896 --> 44:52.773
my daughter's alive.

44:55.609 --> 44:56.610
Astounding.

45:01.156 --> 45:04.576
You can't die until you kill her.

45:05.994 --> 45:07.037
You'll have

45:08.747 --> 45:10.207
to live in a living hell

45:11.542 --> 45:13.043
alone all your life.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.714
But there's one important detail
you're missing.

45:20.717 --> 45:23.470
You can never kill me.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.474
Because that's not the end of my future.

45:29.017 --> 45:31.186
I'm the only person

45:33.272 --> 45:35.023
who can end my life.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.536
Let's end it for real now.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.166
You'll forget everything
that was said here,

45:53.250 --> 45:55.210
and I'll reach the end of my future.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.882
You'll like as my worker ant
for the rest of your life.

46:01.550 --> 46:02.885
That's how it'll end.

46:08.348 --> 46:09.349
I…

46:12.728 --> 46:14.271
appreciate what you did, Jo Kyung-ho.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.234
For enlightening me.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.154
I'll

46:24.948 --> 46:26.074
choose to die every day.

47:15.791 --> 47:16.792
Hello?

47:17.876 --> 47:19.127
This is

47:21.213 --> 47:24.174
Sanho-dong 36-11.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.343
There's been a murder.

47:27.302 --> 47:28.303
The murder suspect

47:29.304 --> 47:31.390
is Lieutenant Choi Hyung-in

47:34.351 --> 47:36.353
of Gyeongnam Provincial Police's
mobile investigation unit.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.981
The suspect might flee the scene.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.693
So please dispatch the police quickly.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.173
It's him.

48:07.175 --> 48:10.721
Now Guru has something to tell you.

48:11.388 --> 48:12.347
Answer it.

48:13.432 --> 48:14.391
<i>Hello?</i>

48:15.684 --> 48:16.643
<i>Hello?</i>

48:20.188 --> 48:21.315
Is it you, mister?

48:21.398 --> 48:23.025
Is this Jae-young?

48:26.153 --> 48:28.280
Yes, it's me, mister.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.073
Are you okay?

48:32.534 --> 48:33.493
Yes.

48:35.203 --> 48:38.040
I'm okay. How about you, mister?

48:39.082 --> 48:41.668
I'm okay, too.

48:43.211 --> 48:44.254
<i>Okay.</i>

48:46.256 --> 48:47.257
Jae-young.

48:48.884 --> 48:49.718
Yes?

48:52.012 --> 48:52.888
I'm sorry.

48:54.806 --> 48:56.642
You don't have to be, mister.

49:02.731 --> 49:03.815
Will I

49:06.109 --> 49:08.111
be able to see you later?

49:12.074 --> 49:12.991
Yeah,

49:14.284 --> 49:15.661
I'll see you later.

49:16.995 --> 49:19.915
Okay, mister.
I'll be waiting for you then.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.293
I'll see you at your house.

49:27.714 --> 49:28.965
Hello? Guru?

49:30.884 --> 49:32.010
<i>Hello?</i>

49:33.845 --> 49:35.097
Guru is dead.

49:51.822 --> 49:52.864
What?

49:54.658 --> 49:56.118
That's impossible.

49:56.910 --> 50:00.372
How can you be fine?

50:00.455 --> 50:03.583
How could you be talking
to me over the phone?

50:04.167 --> 50:06.211
You're a fool.

50:07.254 --> 50:08.588
What did you say?

50:08.672 --> 50:09.506
Did you think

50:10.716 --> 50:12.592
you'd get your way?

50:15.137 --> 50:16.471
I'll see you in hell.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.979
Hello?

50:25.480 --> 50:27.607
He's gone insane.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.157
<i>The number you have dialed cannot be…</i>

50:38.535 --> 50:39.494
It's okay.

50:40.454 --> 50:43.623
Guru is dead so that's all that matters.

50:44.291 --> 50:47.461
Nobody can stop me anymore.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.756
Jae-young, I'm sorry.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.048
But I have no choice.

50:52.132 --> 50:55.385
Life is unfair, you see.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.561
How can you…

51:20.994 --> 51:22.788
I came to avenge my boss.

51:25.957 --> 51:26.958
Avenge who?

51:28.210 --> 51:29.252
Boss?

51:30.796 --> 51:33.590
-What are you talking about?
-My boss went to the same school as you.

51:34.299 --> 51:35.425
Same school?

51:40.889 --> 51:41.765
Kang Yong-tak.

51:41.848 --> 51:42.724
So it's you.

51:44.142 --> 51:45.602
You killed my boss.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.063
Don't point the gun at me. How dare you?

51:48.146 --> 51:50.774
I'm the sole successor to Guru.

51:50.857 --> 51:52.067
His true successor…

52:04.079 --> 52:05.038
Stop it.

52:07.249 --> 52:08.291
What is this?

52:08.375 --> 52:10.293
I'm telling you to stop.

52:13.004 --> 52:16.341
How could you still be alive?

52:22.305 --> 52:24.516
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.238
What am I seeing?

52:39.155 --> 52:42.576
What are these visions?

52:54.337 --> 52:56.840
Whatever you try…

52:57.799 --> 53:01.261
You can't stop me.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.245
Se-yoon.

54:11.247 --> 54:12.499
No.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.834
I didn't do it.

54:15.794 --> 54:16.711
Se…

54:18.421 --> 54:19.547
No.

54:27.263 --> 54:29.516
I didn't kill her.

54:53.081 --> 54:54.124
Aunt.

54:54.916 --> 54:55.959
It's over.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.386
Aunt.

55:06.469 --> 55:07.470
Aunt!

55:36.416 --> 55:40.378
<i>Whoever sees the video
will die no matter what.</i>

55:43.214 --> 55:44.883
And will kill the person…

55:46.051 --> 55:47.802
The person

55:49.345 --> 55:50.722
they love the most.

55:52.474 --> 55:53.558
I'm okay.

55:54.893 --> 55:57.771
It's okay.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.524
So please live on, son.

56:02.776 --> 56:06.154
No matter what people say you must live.

58:24.751 --> 58:25.752
Aunt.

58:27.378 --> 58:28.296
Aunt.

58:29.214 --> 58:30.256
Are you okay?

58:51.402 --> 58:53.488
6 MONTHS LATER

59:29.983 --> 59:31.025
I'm worried.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.362
You don't look well.

59:37.615 --> 59:38.449
I don't?

59:38.533 --> 59:40.827
There are people who can help you,
including me.

59:41.786 --> 59:43.580
If you die like this,

59:45.540 --> 59:47.250
a lot of people will be sad.

59:48.251 --> 59:50.712
I'd like to find a way somehow.

59:51.588 --> 59:52.797
You know…

59:54.591 --> 59:55.633
Is Jae-young

59:57.176 --> 59:58.928
doing fine?

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:02.223
Yes.

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:06.352
She's back to living a normal life.

1:00:17.071 --> 1:00:18.489
Do you see these scars?

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:21.451
I'll probably

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:24.829
have these scars for life.

1:00:26.205 --> 1:00:27.457
They can't be removed.

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:32.629
But I can't dwell on these scars
for the rest of my life.

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:38.801
You need to see Jae-young.

1:00:41.429 --> 1:00:43.097
After she graduates,

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:46.100
gets a job, and finds her loved one…

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:47.894
You need

1:00:49.395 --> 1:00:51.189
to watch her when she

1:00:51.898 --> 1:00:53.232
starts her own family.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.110
You have to stay alive, Detective.

1:01:09.582 --> 1:01:10.667
I agree with you.

1:01:11.542 --> 1:01:12.710
You and Jae-young

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:15.546
must go on with your lives.

1:01:17.465 --> 1:01:19.050
You both deserve that.

1:01:20.259 --> 1:01:21.594
But my situation is different.

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:23.388
I might

1:01:24.597 --> 1:01:25.973
die here.

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:32.021
Every night, I see visions
where people swarm around me.

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.733
They tear off my limbs.

1:01:36.567 --> 1:01:38.986
And they won't stop
whispering into my ear,

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:40.530
telling me to kill my daughter.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:46.577
Otherwise, my pain will never end.
They say it'll go on forever.

1:01:49.163 --> 1:01:51.416
It's getting worse by the day.

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:54.085
The visions are getting sharper in focus.

1:01:54.168 --> 1:01:57.630
I think that's occurring

1:01:58.423 --> 1:02:00.800
because my love for my daughter, Jae-young

1:02:01.759 --> 1:02:03.761
hasn't changed.

1:02:05.346 --> 1:02:06.305
Jung-hyun.

1:02:06.806 --> 1:02:08.599
Have you thought about

1:02:09.350 --> 1:02:11.352
the despicable acts I committed

1:02:12.645 --> 1:02:14.272
against your dad in the past?

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:16.983
Yes, I have.

1:02:17.066 --> 1:02:17.984
You'll have to

1:02:19.819 --> 1:02:21.904
live with that guilt, Detective.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:26.367
Stay alive and remember your sins.

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:28.244
As long as you don't forget it, it's fine.

1:02:28.327 --> 1:02:29.203
No.

1:02:30.371 --> 1:02:31.581
One day,

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.625
I'll forget my sins.

1:02:34.709 --> 1:02:38.671
Only the victims
will never forget what happened.

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:40.256
Just like how it is today.

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:48.514
The ordeal they endured will torment them
every night like a never-ending nightmare.

1:02:50.057 --> 1:02:53.102
But monsters will never keep

1:02:53.978 --> 1:02:55.855
the memories of their sinful acts

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:58.649
in the recesses of their minds.

1:03:01.068 --> 1:03:02.403
I no longer

1:03:04.739 --> 1:03:06.866
want to live as a monster.

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:11.162
I've had enough.

1:03:12.955 --> 1:03:14.832
I'm able to clearly see

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:17.460
my past

1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:20.588
amidst my pain.

1:03:22.632 --> 1:03:24.801
I'll endure it all.

1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:29.430
After that,

1:03:31.682 --> 1:03:33.100
if I have the chance…

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:37.355
If I earn the right,

1:03:41.567 --> 1:03:43.069
I'd like to tell my daughter this

1:03:47.281 --> 1:03:49.700
when I reach the end of this road.

1:04:06.133 --> 1:04:07.051
<i>Daughter.</i>

1:04:08.052 --> 1:04:09.053
If there is

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.515
an unlit room inside your soul,

1:04:13.558 --> 1:04:14.392
and if

1:04:15.810 --> 1:04:17.812
it's dark and cold in there…

1:04:19.355 --> 1:04:20.815
If you've kept that room

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:25.152
closed your entire life,

1:04:26.821 --> 1:04:28.155
I hope that my decision

1:04:30.116 --> 1:04:31.492
will bring light

1:04:32.910 --> 1:04:34.662
to that place.

1:04:37.665 --> 1:04:39.625
I wish it'll bring warmth…

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:44.505
And shine ever so dimly…

1:04:50.386 --> 1:04:51.596
Then one day…

1:04:59.353 --> 1:05:00.271
So…

1:05:05.610 --> 1:05:06.652
Is my dad

1:05:08.779 --> 1:05:10.323
doing okay?

1:05:14.452 --> 1:05:15.286
Yeah.

1:05:26.839 --> 1:05:28.007
<i>Please open the door</i>

1:05:30.176 --> 1:05:32.011
<i>in your soul</i>

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:35.097
<i>that</i>

1:05:36.974 --> 1:05:38.559
<i>you've kept tightly shut.</i>

1:06:12.551 --> 1:06:15.054
Can't you stop?

1:06:17.515 --> 1:06:20.559
You can stop all of this right now.

1:06:22.353 --> 1:06:23.688
If you were to do that,

1:06:24.689 --> 1:06:26.482
then you could

1:06:27.566 --> 1:06:28.484
return home.

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:30.736
Don't you think so?

1:06:33.823 --> 1:06:34.824
Home?

1:06:35.658 --> 1:06:38.077
Yes, our home.

1:06:42.081 --> 1:06:43.207
I wish you could do that

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:45.918
even though it's a bit late.

1:06:47.003 --> 1:06:50.381
I hope you can live a normal life, mister.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:53.384
You really think that's possible?

1:06:53.968 --> 1:06:54.802
Yes.

1:06:56.846 --> 1:06:59.432
I know It'll take a long time…

1:07:00.891 --> 1:07:02.059
But I don't think

1:07:03.310 --> 1:07:04.395
it's impossible.

1:07:05.062 --> 1:07:09.817
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING <i>HOMETOWN</i>

1:07:14.947 --> 1:07:19.952
