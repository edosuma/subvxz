WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.437
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.471 --> 00:04.605
Fiddler's Neck.
Is this where you grew up?

00:04.638 --> 00:06.740
It's for you, Dash.
I programmed this

00:06.774 --> 00:08.309
to give a 30-second warning.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.810
Uh-oh.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.944
I've looked out for my brother.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.181
Now, we have our share
of disagreements,

00:13.214 --> 00:14.815
but I'd never let anybody
hurt him.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.451
Detective Vega, Henry
Blomfeld, Deputy Director

00:17.485 --> 00:19.353
of the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.289
They're vetting me.
A D.I.A. job?

00:21.322 --> 00:23.357
For six years,
the three Precognitives saw

00:23.391 --> 00:25.293
every murder in D.C.
before it happened.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.229
When they went in,
they were kids. I'm not so sure

00:28.262 --> 00:29.397
they'll do well out there
in the world.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.764
Agatha becomes the person

00:30.798 --> 00:32.300
whose future she predicts.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.667
And I feel
what the victim feels.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.735
WALLY:
Arthur's mind is an antenna,

00:34.768 --> 00:36.070
pulling in names,

00:36.104 --> 00:38.139
facts, information.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.141
VEGA: How much does that
sell for on the black market?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.575
But Dash sees the horror.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.146
We can change the future, right?

00:45.179 --> 00:47.515
Sometimes it's the past
that's harder to escape.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.285
*

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
(panting softly)

01:09.837 --> 01:12.773
Dashiell?

01:12.806 --> 01:16.344
Remember me? My name is Wally.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.379
I'm here to help.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.618
Where...

01:24.652 --> 01:27.155
When is this?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.158
Now.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.194
It's now, Dash.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.332
There you go.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.700
Mm-hmm.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.569
One foot after the other.
Okay, straight back.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.903
There you go.
Your bodies will remember.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.405
Nice.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.740
BLOMFELD:
Did you read the media release?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.277
Yeah.
Something about...

01:49.310 --> 01:51.412
sending them off to live
happily ever after.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.381
Alone and in peace.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.616
And what's
the nonfiction?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.452
Can't say, Henry.
You know that.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.188
No one wants
this hot potato.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.622
They disappear,

02:01.655 --> 02:02.790
we all sleep easy.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.193
My agency had
plans for them.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.395
(chuckles)
Yeah, well, who didn't?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.397
But it's over now.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.765
They get to be human.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.367
Try, anyway.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.703
They aren't meant
for dry land.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.871
They won't survive
out there.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.742
What a waste.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.544
All three of your identities
have been erased

02:23.577 --> 02:26.480
from every system--
eye-dents, Social Security.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.915
Erased?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.817
You mean we don't exist?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.720
It's the only way to keep you
safe. No one knows who you are,

02:32.753 --> 02:35.323
what you look like. There's
no cyber trail to follow.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.259
But we'll need identities; we
can't go anywhere without them.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.693
There are places.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.295
You'll be given
a map and cash.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.630
It's a significant amount.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.964
We'll take you
to the Sprawl.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.899
There you'll buy a car.
ARTHUR: Car?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.568
But we don't know
how to drive.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.936
I suggest you learn.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.938
But where do we go?
Where do we live?

02:50.971 --> 02:53.541
WOMAN: That's up to you.
We don't want to know.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.477
For your own safety and
reasons of national security,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.579
your anonymity
is the best protection.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.481
How are we supposed
to survive out there?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.782
On your wits.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.385
You have a
considerable amount.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.395
VEGA: There were three of them:
Dash, Arthur and Agatha.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.830
They were called
the Precognitives.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.567
They could see murders
before they happened.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.836
For six years, our police
held them against their will

03:22.870 --> 03:24.905
and used them to save lives.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.008
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.278
they were finally released.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.547
They kept themselves safe
and hidden from the world,

03:33.581 --> 03:35.583
until now.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.288
(distorted, echoing voices)

03:40.288 --> 03:41.855
It's about that time...

03:46.294 --> 03:47.828
(men shouting)
Get the case!

03:50.631 --> 03:51.699
(groaning)

03:59.072 --> 04:01.709
(echoing):
It's about time for a...

04:01.742 --> 04:03.811
VEGA:
What time did the beer ad say?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.646
9:42 p.m. I told you.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.914
But you can't identify
the corner?

04:06.947 --> 04:08.316
I can identify the beer.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.883
Not helping.
I don't know.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.486
It looked like it happened
downtown. It happened fast.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.356
9:41. One minute.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.660
No.
(panting)

04:19.693 --> 04:21.395
How did we miss it?

04:21.429 --> 04:23.063
That clock on
the ad is fast.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.933
Damn! We had, like,
what, 40 minutes?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.568
Wasn't enough time.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.903
I'm sorry.
(panting)

04:29.937 --> 04:32.005
I didn't see it sooner.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.574
That's not what I meant.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.543
It's just...

04:35.576 --> 04:37.645
we've been on a roll.

04:37.678 --> 04:41.048
I forgot
what it's like to lose.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.817
Hey. We should go.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.986
You don't want to go down there
and tell them what we know?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.556
You mean tell them
what we saw in your vision?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.558
We can't be here
before the police.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.959
We have
no reason to be.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.927
And they just get away with it?
Look, I'll call

04:53.961 --> 04:56.029
the local district in the
morning and see if I can help.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.600
But right now, we need to be
as smart as we are pissed.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.470
So you take that feeling
you have now

05:02.503 --> 05:04.472
and bring it with you
to work tomorrow.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.522
All good.
We're packing him up now.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.569
You really want to gamble
that much money, Mr. Watson?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.571
Apologies, Matthis.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.972
Buy those stones
at market value

05:39.006 --> 05:42.042
and continue this meeting
at a later time.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.911
Tot ziens.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.414
Working late?

05:46.414 --> 05:49.450
Morning in Antwerp.
Join me.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.052
Want a drink?

05:52.085 --> 05:54.087
Yeah, actually.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.894
Bad day at the office?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.630
We lost one.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.432
I tried calling you.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.799
I'm sure you
saw it, too.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.468
Downtown, right?

06:07.501 --> 06:08.969
All I got was "Third Street."

06:09.002 --> 06:11.539
Robbery gone bad.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.907
I don't know why
they had to kill the guy.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.843
Is there anything else
you can give me?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.144
Like a name?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.946
Thought you worked
in Precrime, not post-crime.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.582
They have a department
for that--

06:21.615 --> 06:23.451
same building,
uniforms and everything.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.918
I could at least help
with evidence.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.887
Leave it for the janitors.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.065
You got a name?

06:38.098 --> 06:41.068
Yeah.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.470
Of a masseuse.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.637
You need to relax.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.838
She's good with

06:44.872 --> 06:47.174
much more than her hands.

06:49.209 --> 06:53.013
Don't dwell on the ones
you can't save, Dash.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.683
I never did.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.626
(sighs)

07:06.694 --> 07:09.162
I know what
you're thinking.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.932
It's fine.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.768
He won't be a problem.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.508
It's not our case. Smart
men and women are on it.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.810
Smart men and women
don't know what I know.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.812
We can help them.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
Why won't you let
this one go, Dash?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.783
I've never let any of them go.
That's why I'm still here.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.786
There'll be other lives
to save.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.522
What if those muggers
kill someone else

07:34.555 --> 07:36.624
and we don't get there
in time either?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.959
What then?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.804
*

08:06.253 --> 08:08.656
Omri Nellas.

08:08.689 --> 08:13.060
One Capital Trust bank.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.195
Sterling Road.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
MOSI:
Look, Vega, I double-checked,

08:19.567 --> 08:20.601
but none of the EMS teams

08:20.634 --> 08:21.869
have anything in their records.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.136
Wait, say that again, Mosi.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.938
There's no report
from last night

08:24.972 --> 08:26.139
of a stabbing
in the Sprawl.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.141
That's impossible. I saw it.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.843
I saw the medics take the body.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.780
Well, no one
reported it to us.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.915
Doesn't make any sense.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.851
Wish I could
help you.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.829
Um, hello.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.164
Is this the Nellas residence?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.833
And who's asking?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.702
My name is Dash Parker.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.670
I'm an analyst with Metro P.D.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.673
May I come in, Mrs...?

08:59.707 --> 09:02.710
Nellas. Yes, of course, come in.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.848
Sorry to intrude
at a time like this.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.983
I'm sure it's
not very easy.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.353
Oh, it's-it's
not a problem.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.189
I'm really very
sorry for your loss.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.026
Loss? Did something happen?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.294
You...

09:21.328 --> 09:23.163
You haven't heard?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.798
Heard what? What's...

09:24.832 --> 09:27.234
(sighs)
What's happened?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.304
Mrs. Nellas, he...

09:33.741 --> 09:36.076
Omri was killed last night

09:36.109 --> 09:39.012
in a mugging...
on his way home

09:39.046 --> 09:40.280
from the bank.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.185
No, but I-I-I...

09:45.218 --> 09:48.989
I thought he-he left on a
business trip yesterday morning,

09:49.022 --> 09:52.125
and I... I wasn't expecting
to hear from him until...

09:52.159 --> 09:53.661
I'm really sorry.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.796
I thought someone
would have notified you.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.898
He must have been
on his way home

09:57.931 --> 10:00.801
from work at the bank--
it-it happened so fast.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.072
And you're sure
about this?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.274
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.081
(sighs)

10:14.114 --> 10:15.282
I really...

10:15.315 --> 10:17.617
appreciate the visit.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.389
But you picked the wrong door
to knock on today.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.960
(groans)

10:40.774 --> 10:43.143
What do we do?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.178
We act natural.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.955
(distorted, overlapping voices)

10:54.988 --> 10:58.291
WOMAN: Hey. You just
gonna stand there?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.993
Hi.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.265
What can I get for ya?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.901
You tell me.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.937
Well, our menu covers
our burgers and beer,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.305
and I think we're running
a special today.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.874
I don't like meat loaf.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.242
(laughs)

11:15.275 --> 11:17.110
That's funny.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.979
How'd you know it was meat loaf?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.149
I read your mind.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.418
(laughs)

11:25.452 --> 11:27.220
Okay.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.990
All right.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.025
(chuckles) Well, we have
a lager that's really good.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.427
You want to try that?
Okay.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.463
Where do we go next?

11:36.496 --> 11:41.168
Before we left the city,
I read about an island.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.770
Fiddler's Neck.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.772
It used to be part
of the mainland,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.840
before the waters rose.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.813
Now it's just a tiny,
forgotten speck.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.447
Bankrupt, little
government oversight.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.784
There's a ferry that runs there
every morning.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.118
We stay here
overnight,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.486
and we head out tomorrow.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.156
There you go.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.227
(gags)

12:07.260 --> 12:08.328
(coughs)

12:08.361 --> 12:09.529
(clears throat)

12:09.562 --> 12:11.364
(coughs)

12:11.398 --> 12:12.800
(chuckles softly)

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
Don't worry about it.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.804
Second sip
always goes down easier.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.039
(chuckles)

12:19.072 --> 12:20.841
DASH (recorded):
You've reached Dash Parker.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.409
Please leave a message.
(beep)

12:22.442 --> 12:24.812
Where the hell are you, Dash?
There's something up

12:24.812 --> 12:27.414
with the murder from last night;
there's no record of it.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.349
I checked your search history
and I saw that you got

12:29.382 --> 12:30.851
an address.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.319
Hope you're not doing
anything stupid.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.221
Call me back.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.927
(knocking)

12:48.535 --> 12:50.904
Metro P.D.!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.852
Lenses.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.001
Blood.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.871
System, run sequencer.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.110
(whispers):
Dash.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.247
What the hell?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.216
They took Dash, and
then they came here.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.551
Who?
I don't know. I was
hoping that you did.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.387
They were looking
for something.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.155
What would anybody
want from Dash?

13:42.189 --> 13:44.291
He was following a case--
the murder from last night.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.127
I wasn't with him.
You sent him out alone?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.629
I didn't send him out anywhere;
he went by himself deliberately.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.132
And I'm sure you have nothing
to do with the trouble
he's in right now.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.601
Did you see anything or not?
I don't see kidnappings.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.037
I'm not talking about Dash,
I'm talking about the murder.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.106
The mugging
of the banker.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.912
The guy's name
was Nellas.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.914
He was stabbed
to death.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.017
I found a trace of Dash's
blood in his apartment.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.589
Did you call anyone
from Metro about this?

14:16.623 --> 14:17.958
Your lieutenant friend?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.292
No, I wanted to talk
to you first.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.430
Good. Don't call anyone.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.566
Wait, Arthur, what is it?
Do you know something?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.603
Dash found me for a drink
last night.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.105
He mentioned the mugging.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.207
I tried to steer him
away from it.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.076
Why?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.647
Because I knew who Nellas was
and who he worked for.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.515
Capital Trust.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.252
That's who employed him.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.221
That's not who he worked for.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.694
MAN (distorted, echoing):
We can't keep him here forever.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.163
WOMAN:
What was I supposed to do?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.231
I don't usually take prisoners.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.567
No one lives that long
around me.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.969
MAN:
What did Van Zant say?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.471
WOMAN:
He said he was on his way.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.605
Hey, Cleo.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.207
(groans)

15:07.240 --> 15:09.009
Look who's awake.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.511
Those are the aftereffects
of the chloromethane.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.246
MAN: It hits you
like a freight train,

15:13.280 --> 15:14.614
but leaves you
all twitchy.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.050
He was already twitchy.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.587
Can somebody just tell me
what's going on?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.055
Why am I here?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.356
MAN:
You tell us.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.992
You came looking
for Omri Nellas.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.626
What exactly do you know
about him?

15:26.659 --> 15:29.562
I told you, Aziz.
This guy says Nellas is dead.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.000
What makes you think that?

15:33.033 --> 15:35.468
Because I saw it happen.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.639
Do I know you?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.275
I don't think so.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.512
If we met, chances are
you wouldn't be alive.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.447
(quietly):
That's good to know.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.016
There's no need to whisper.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.283
Where we are,

15:50.317 --> 15:53.253
no one can
hear you scream.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.123
Not that it should stop you.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.258
I understand you know what
happened to my friend.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.527
You have the wrong guy.
Yes,

16:00.560 --> 16:04.297
well, that's how most of these
conversations start.

16:04.331 --> 16:08.035
What were you doing knocking
on Omri Nellas's door?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.237
He was murdered
last night.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.172
And you saw this happen?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.707
DASH:
From a distance.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.443
It was a mugging.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.745
He was... stabbed.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.747
There was nothing
I could do.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.383
And why were you
at his apartment?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.118
I was paying my respects.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.054
I thought she was his wife.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.690
Who are you?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.094
I'm a victim, Dash,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.063
just like you.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.597
Someone stole something from me,

16:37.630 --> 16:40.633
and now I'm missing
two very important things:

16:40.667 --> 16:44.137
my banker, Omri Nellas,
and my money.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.706
I want to
get it back.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.708
Can you help me get it back?

16:48.741 --> 16:52.312
I don't know how,
because I don't know anything.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.647
You know what?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.283
I believe you.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.550
It's just...

16:57.584 --> 16:59.819
they're a little more cynical.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.455
So you're going to
have to convince them.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.756
And if you don't want

17:03.790 --> 17:05.625
to be missing
anything important--

17:05.658 --> 17:07.494
fingers, toes,

17:07.527 --> 17:08.528
the ability
to reproduce--

17:08.561 --> 17:10.197
I think you should tell them

17:10.230 --> 17:11.431
what you know.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.667
I don't know anything.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.303
That's not true.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.172
You seem to know
Arthur Watson.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.308
He's my brother.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.379
Oh, this day just
keeps getting better.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.754
AGATHA:
I'm telling you to stay here.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
You're not our jailer, Agatha.
They set us free.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
Yes, to leave,
to stay far away.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.227
This world is
not safe for us.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.229
For you, maybe. I'm doing fine.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.132
You want to risk our safety for
some girl's you just met today?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.634
She gave me her number.
Her number? What's that?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.137
I'm pretty sure
it's a good thing.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.206
You coming?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.374
AGATHA:
We don't have time for this.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.343
We have a plan.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.279
She smiled at me.
What?

17:59.312 --> 18:02.782
I got a head full of horrors,
but today someone smiled at me.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.619
And I'm gonna go back there
and see if she'll do it again.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.754
Wait.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.160
AGATHA:
Dash.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.163
Relax, brother.
You're all I got.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.830
I'll never let anything
happen to you.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.569
VEGA:
So you're telling me

18:22.602 --> 18:24.737
the man that has your brother
is Luca Van Zant?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.306
Top of the felon
food chain?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.474
The one and only.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.609
(sighs)
I'm calling it in.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.810
Let's consider this a minute.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.512
Consider what? One phone call,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.747
and I can mobilize a SWAT team
anywhere in D.C.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.616
in less than six minutes.
First of all,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.785
wow, you got me beat--
I can't do that.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.587
Second,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.189
police will just make it worse.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.257
Arthur, your brother
is gonna be murdered,

18:44.291 --> 18:45.925
and we don't know how soon.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.295
And the first sign of cops
will make him dead faster.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.862
We need to do this

18:49.896 --> 18:52.265
the smart way-- my way.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.703
Vega, he's my brother.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.538
This is my sandbox.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.207
I could get him back.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.578
First sign of trouble,
and I'm calling Blake.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.847
And then you get to answer
all of his questions.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.849
How does that sound?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.719
(sighs)
What's the play?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.454
We talk to Van Zant.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.356
Where do we find him?

19:16.389 --> 19:19.726
He doesn't keep an office,
but he likes the finer things.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.329
Most nights, you can find him
at LaMarsh's.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.596
I don't think
Metro knows this.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.498
Precisely why
we keep them out of it.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.967
I'll take care of this.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.269
I'm coming with you.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.670
No.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.939
I have to go alone.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.912
Pleasure doing
business with you.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.820
VAN ZANT:
Come in, Mr. Watson.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.328
Thank you
for seeing me.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.631
"This is the night

19:58.665 --> 20:02.402
that either makes me
or fordoes me quite."

20:05.037 --> 20:07.407
Is that supposed
to mean something?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.442
It's Iago.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.613
Othello: Act 5, Scene 1.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.882
Studied all
the classics.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.985
I wondered how long it would
take you to end up here.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.987
Most people don't get
this close to me.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.290
Most people
don't get the chance.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.957
You don't get to where I am
by taking chances.

20:24.991 --> 20:25.958
No.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.460
You get there by being

20:27.494 --> 20:29.929
the guy everyone needs
something from.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.531
That's how you did it, right?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.367
You seem to know a lot about me.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.269
Curiously, I know

20:36.303 --> 20:40.006
little about you.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.544
What's your secret?
Three years ago,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.713
no one had ever heard the
name of Arthur Watson,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.681
and now you're the
only game in town

20:48.715 --> 20:49.882
for clean identities.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.784
I'm in estate planning.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.953
And your brother?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.458
Parking enforcement officer?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.427
Is he still alive?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.061
Why wouldn't he be alive?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.664
People tend not to stay that way
around you very long.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.367
That's the other way
to get to where I am.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.439
You got something I want.
Let's talk business.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.508
Last night, I went to bed
with $50 million tucked away

21:15.542 --> 21:17.444
in the One Capital Trust bank

21:17.477 --> 21:20.980
under the watchful eye of
a banker named Omri Nellas.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.683
I wake up today
to hear that he's dead

21:23.716 --> 21:26.486
and the money he laundered
for me is missing.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.355
If that's not enough,

21:28.355 --> 21:31.391
your brother comes sniffing
around Nellas's apartment.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.560
Mr. Van Zant,
I didn't take your money.

21:33.593 --> 21:37.029
And I'm supposed to take you on,
what, your word?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.731
Where's Dash?
Locked away

21:38.765 --> 21:40.567
somewhere deep and dark.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.436
And he'll stay that way,
like a cask of amontillado,

21:43.470 --> 21:46.072
if you don't
return what's mine.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.507
I don't have what's yours.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.410
We'll soon find out, won't we?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.646
I want my brother back alive.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.915
Then the tab is due.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.650
And the price is $50 million.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.590
I'll be waiting.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.030
How did Omri Nellas
steal millions of dollars

22:11.063 --> 22:12.699
if he was murdered last night?

22:12.732 --> 22:13.966
ARTHUR:
Supernaturally?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.668
Really? Joking now?

22:15.702 --> 22:17.437
What are we gonna do?
We don't have that money

22:17.470 --> 22:18.505
and we don't know
where they're keeping Dash.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.872
We need to find those thugs

22:19.906 --> 22:21.441
that stabbed Nellas.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.476
They're the only lead we have.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.413
Arthur?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.449
Yeah, about that, Vega.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.519
I, uh...
I got to show you something.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.554
My place.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.496
These are good.
Grim, but good.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.132
What do you do, read the obits
and then draw them?

22:46.165 --> 22:47.700
That's twisted.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.437
I guess I have murder
on the brain.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.041
My husband liked to paint.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.176
Oh, yeah. Like what?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.446
Roller coasters.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.648
The real ones,
not that virtual crap

23:01.681 --> 23:04.050
they have now.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.985
He would drive
all over the country

23:06.018 --> 23:07.654
to find them.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.790
He loved
the wooden ones.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.859
How long have you
and Aziz been together?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.697
Too long, maybe.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.767
Since your husband died?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.936
I never said that he died.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.606
I took a guess.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.509
There was pain in your voice
when you talked about him.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.046
Aziz knew him, too?
Your husband?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.082
We lived together.
A one-bedroom

23:36.115 --> 23:37.484
in the Sprawl.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.051
You slept on a cot
in the kitchen.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.554
How could you know that?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.091
I know a lot more.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.832
I knew who
Omri Nellas was

23:52.865 --> 23:55.835
last night when I had
the vision of him.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.870
You told me that already.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.807
But what I didn't tell you
was I had some people I know

24:00.840 --> 24:03.610
pick up the body before the
cops put it on the books.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.680
Those paramedics?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.048
They were yours?

24:09.081 --> 24:10.850
Technically, Andromeda's.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.886
My associate, but yes.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.590
Arthur, did you
kill Omri Nellas?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.726
No.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.794
That crime was random.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.130
But I did cover it up
long enough

24:24.163 --> 24:28.100
to walk into One Capital Trust
this morning with Nellas's I.D.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.902
and liquidate
all of his accounts.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.271
It was me, Vega.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.607
I stole Luca Van Zant's money.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.844
I'm the reason they took Dash.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.121
*

24:52.291 --> 24:53.693
Hey.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.695
Back already?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.096
I thought I'd try
another round

24:57.129 --> 24:59.098
of those, uh, beers.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.568
All right, well,
they're coming right up.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.904
Who's your friend?

25:04.937 --> 25:07.239
This is my brother, Dash.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.908
Oh, hi.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.944
So... where are you boys
heading in the morning?

25:15.247 --> 25:16.883
Well, don't look so shocked.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.586
Just about everyone here
is just passing through.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.721
We're not really sure.
ARTHUR: Some island--

25:21.754 --> 25:22.755
Fiddler's something.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.157
Fiddler's Neck?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.593
Yeah?

25:26.593 --> 25:27.827
I know it.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.328
You know, there are freaks

25:29.361 --> 25:31.964
and weirdos out there;
you guys got to be careful.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.766
We'll fit right in.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.734
(laughs)

25:34.767 --> 25:35.835
We should go.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.136
Maybe you could come up

25:37.169 --> 25:38.905
and meet me,
or I could come back

25:38.938 --> 25:40.807
here sometime.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.174
When you're
finished there...

25:45.011 --> 25:47.279
Boyd, you're done.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.881
Why don't you head on home?

25:48.915 --> 25:52.118
(chuckles)
I'm not even halfway there.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.920
So why don't you
button that top button

25:53.953 --> 25:56.222
and take care of the
longtime customers

25:56.255 --> 25:58.224
and not just those
passing through.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.863
Don't mind him.
(clears throat)

26:03.896 --> 26:07.767
Last farm in the county
went fully automated last week.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.836
Boyd lost his job.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.238
Don't make me look like
some pitiful loser.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.906
ARTHUR:
Yeah.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.676
He's doing a good enough job
of that on his own.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.911
Excuse me?

26:20.379 --> 26:22.148
I'm just trying
to have a beer.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.887
You're finished with that.
Boyd...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.656
Shut up!
Arthur, we should go.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.223
I'm not going
anywhere.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.026
And you can't
talk to her like that.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.128
(chuckles softly)

26:36.162 --> 26:38.731
You're right.

26:38.765 --> 26:39.932
I apologize.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.235
Wait, Boyd! Stop! Boyd!

26:43.269 --> 26:45.237
What the hell?

26:45.271 --> 26:46.706
(grunting)

26:46.739 --> 26:48.941
That was amazing!

26:48.975 --> 26:51.844
I told you we can
take care of ourselves!

26:51.878 --> 26:53.913
(groaning)

26:53.946 --> 26:55.682
(chuckles)

26:56.448 --> 26:58.685
Dash? Are you...

27:00.052 --> 27:01.320
(screaming)
You don't listen

27:01.353 --> 27:02.955
when I talk!

27:03.923 --> 27:05.091
Shut up!

27:05.958 --> 27:06.993
(shouts)

27:07.026 --> 27:08.728
(gasping)

27:08.761 --> 27:09.829
Shut up!

27:12.098 --> 27:16.035
(both panting)

27:19.205 --> 27:21.373
ARTHUR: Why are people
always hitting me?

27:21.407 --> 27:23.442
Because you give them
a reason to.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.411
How could you have done this?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.714
It's what I do.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.949
Look, even
after Van Zant

27:29.982 --> 27:31.383
found out his money was gone,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.452
he would've been
tracking Nellas for months.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.254
He would have been
chasing a ghost.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.455
I was in the clear before...

27:36.488 --> 27:38.725
Really?
You're gonna blame Dash?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.192
Actually, I was gonna blame you.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.128
This is your fault
and you know it.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.930
So you stole the money.
Fine.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.765
Let's just give it back.
Can't do that.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.734
It's all red diamonds
in Hong Kong by now.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.736
Is that a metaphor?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.137
Look, it doesn't matter.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.005
It's not about the money
to Van Zant.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.807
It's about his
reputation.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.976
He'll kill all of us
for just being involved.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.978
And I'll kill you if we don't
get Dash back in one piece.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.112
All that talk about

28:00.146 --> 28:01.480
how Dash is putting you danger

28:01.513 --> 28:03.215
by working with me?

28:03.249 --> 28:05.151
You did this. Not him.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.753
He's my brother,
I'll find him.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.454
You have an hour.
And then I'm calling Blake...

28:08.487 --> 28:11.390
I know, I know.
You and SWAT are besties.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.325
What are you doing?

28:13.359 --> 28:16.829
Buying time.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.898
CLEO:
Who are you?

28:18.931 --> 28:21.133
I'm someone
who pays attention, Cleo.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.769
(footsteps approaching)

28:22.769 --> 28:24.503
What's going on?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.105
Nothing.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.140
Just getting tired
of this psycho.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.278
Well, the boss called.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.346
His brother
is negotiating.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.382
Wants to meet in the morning.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.986
What's that for?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.788
Proof of life.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.404
All right.
We've got eyes on you.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.439
I feel safer already.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.118
Looks like his name
is Malik Aziz.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.320
Known associate
to Van Zant.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.354
Not a nice person.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.422
Got any good news?

29:18.858 --> 29:20.059
Where's the money?

29:20.092 --> 29:21.828
Earning interest.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.395
Where's my brother?

29:31.437 --> 29:33.005
What's this?

29:33.039 --> 29:35.007
The first installment.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.046
(gasps)

29:41.480 --> 29:42.982
VEGA:
Arthur, don't.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.350
You kill him, you kill Dash.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.452
(gagging)

29:46.485 --> 29:47.920
(coughs)

29:47.954 --> 29:49.221
(panting)

29:54.226 --> 29:56.362
You shouldn't have done that.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.305
Next package
won't be a finger.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.340
You have until dawn.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.618
It was her.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.487
The waitress from inside.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.922
Are you sure?

30:22.955 --> 30:24.924
Then we have to
go back in there.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.325
No. No, we shouldn't.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.593
We have to leave.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.028
Are you serious?

30:29.061 --> 30:31.097
Saving lives
isn't our job anymore.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.364
She's gonna die!

30:32.398 --> 30:34.366
AGATHA:
Because of you.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.635
Me?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.404
Because you got involved.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.039
It is time to go.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.108
It is time
to take care of ourselves.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.575
You want us just to walk away?

30:43.609 --> 30:46.178
No, I want a future!
For all of us.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.315
Then you go live yours.
I'm gonna live mine.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.283
No. Haven't we done enough?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.318
I haven't.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.088
(woman screams)

30:56.122 --> 30:57.890
WOMAN:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

30:57.924 --> 30:59.158
(tires screech)

30:59.191 --> 31:00.359
No.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.430
Somebody help!

31:10.269 --> 31:11.938
(people gasping)

31:11.971 --> 31:13.139
We need to go.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.174
We need to go, now!

31:21.247 --> 31:24.250
It looks small, doesn't it?

31:24.283 --> 31:27.119
Well, you need the hand
for context.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.360
It's, uh...

31:34.393 --> 31:35.694
I know.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.198
I'll put that on ice.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.466
I'm calling Blake.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.468
We still don't know
where Dash is.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.204
Metro has more resources
to find him than you do.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.006
You do what
you got to do.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.340
I'm gonna see Van Zant.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.309
Wait, if you show up
there empty-handed,

31:50.342 --> 31:52.478
he'll kill you.
You know that.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.981
Dash is all that matters now.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.383
I'll buy you as much time
as I can.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.985
And, Vega,

31:58.985 --> 32:01.220
when you see him,

32:01.253 --> 32:03.990
tell him I'm sorry.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.624
And we're even.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.493
What's that supposed to mean?

32:07.526 --> 32:10.029
He'll know.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.673
Why are you alone? Where's Cleo?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.642
I'm right here.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.477
What's going on?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.313
You said it was

32:27.346 --> 32:28.280
an accident.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.615
What?

32:29.648 --> 32:31.583
What did you
say to her?

32:31.617 --> 32:35.321
Just... showing her my art.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.590
You said you came home
and you found him like that.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.538
I told you you looked familiar.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.040
Shut the hell up.

32:54.073 --> 32:57.576
I remembered
that roller coaster.

32:57.609 --> 33:01.313
It always stood out.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.315
You killed him.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.618
You killed my husband.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.354
Are you crazy?

33:08.387 --> 33:11.123
You're gonna believe some...
crappy drawings

33:11.157 --> 33:12.691
from this freak?
Actually,

33:12.724 --> 33:13.592
he's very good.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.593
Think this over.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.661
He knew.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.364
He knew about the painting,

33:18.397 --> 33:20.699
about the roller coaster.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.534
How could he know that?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.238
How could he?!

33:26.272 --> 33:27.239
Baby...

33:27.273 --> 33:28.207
Don't call me that.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.409
I want the truth.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.778
Did Van Zant order it?

33:32.811 --> 33:35.314
Look, listen, I loved you.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.815
I love you.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.718
Just put
the gun down.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.654
(wristband vibrating)

33:45.224 --> 33:47.826
Sorry, Aziz.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.662
That's not gonna happen.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.367
AZIZ:
Cleo, don't do this.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.435
CLEO:
Good-bye, Aziz.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.271
(three gunshots)

33:59.305 --> 34:01.107
(Aziz grunts)

34:07.313 --> 34:09.281
Arthur, I hope you're listening.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.217
(distorted voice echoes)

34:13.219 --> 34:15.221
Dash.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.229
ARTHUR: Dash sent a message.
What do you mean, a message?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.630
I got something, a murder,
and Dash was there.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.132
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but I think

34:26.165 --> 34:27.533
he's sending us a smoke signal.

34:27.566 --> 34:30.136
I got two names: Malik Aziz...

34:30.136 --> 34:31.470
The guy from the alley?

34:31.503 --> 34:34.373
...and Cleo Whitcher.
I can run the name.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.575
You do that. I got to go.
Arthur, wait.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.710
Just let me see
if I can get to Dash first.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.813
Too late.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.286
I've got one hit
on a Cleo Whitcher.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.654
Known address?
An apartment.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.256
But there's a property
in her name,

34:50.289 --> 34:52.558
old family business.
Potomac Sugar Company.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.460
There's a warehouse.
Send me the address.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.727
I'm calling Blake from the car.
Got it.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.868
(quiet hissing)

35:04.770 --> 35:06.305
(door crashes)

35:06.338 --> 35:07.573
BLAKE:
Police! Nobody move!

35:07.606 --> 35:10.776
(officers shouting)

35:10.809 --> 35:13.212
Dash.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.247
You okay?

35:15.281 --> 35:17.283
He heard me.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.357
Hey!

35:25.391 --> 35:27.259
Don't hurt her.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.527
She saved my life.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.697
Is he okay?

35:39.771 --> 35:43.342
DASH:
Where's Arthur?

35:51.883 --> 35:54.786
You're not carrying, I take it?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.822
Just a lifetime of regret.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.290
(chuckles)

35:58.324 --> 35:59.825
Sit.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.263
You know
what that is?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.265
Mezcal.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.234
It was popular back before

36:08.234 --> 36:11.570
the deserts swallowed up
the last agave plants.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.772
It's pretty rare stuff
these days.

36:13.805 --> 36:18.310
We should have respected this
planet when we had the chance.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.579
Funny thing,

36:20.612 --> 36:22.914
respect.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.251
It's a hard thing to have

36:25.251 --> 36:27.586
and a hard thing
to keep in our world.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.522
(wristband vibrates)

36:32.524 --> 36:34.960
(chuckles softly)

36:34.993 --> 36:36.762
Surprisingly,

36:36.795 --> 36:40.432
I found you less obnoxious
when you quoted Shakespeare.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.770
I've enjoyed your company.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.273
It's a shame
to have to kill you.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.442
Before you do...

36:50.476 --> 36:52.544
can I just say,

36:52.578 --> 36:55.581
I do respect you.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.484
When I came to this city,
it was after Precrime.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.619
Things were a mess.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.754
But you cleaned it up.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.756
Your way.

37:04.790 --> 37:08.460
But all that success
went to your head.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.596
Got a little cocky.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.298
A little too greedy.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.500
What's that supposed to mean?

37:14.533 --> 37:16.702
No honor among thieves.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.438
Oh, that's ripe,
coming from you.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.640
See, the reason I'm not going
to give you your money back,

37:21.673 --> 37:25.311
Mr. Van Zant, is because
it wasn't yours to start with.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.746
You skimmed it from your
partners in the Far East.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.483
Easy come, easy go.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.786
What is this?

37:34.820 --> 37:36.588
ARTHUR:
It's called payback.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.624
You stole from them.
I stole it back.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.332
You don't think
they'll kill you, too?

37:47.566 --> 37:49.335
You're as dead

37:49.335 --> 37:50.869
as I am.

37:50.902 --> 37:54.873
Except, after I stole it,
I converted it to red diamonds,

37:54.906 --> 37:58.377
which are trading very high
right now in Hong Kong.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.011
I was sure to drop them off
to these businessmen

38:00.045 --> 38:02.381
so they could get back
what was theirs.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.917
I also took
a small brokerage fee.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.919
(sighs)

38:10.789 --> 38:14.760
I just couldn't act until I knew
my brother was safe.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.363
But now that he is...

38:21.633 --> 38:24.636
"The wheel is come full circle.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.037
I am here."

38:26.071 --> 38:27.839
King Lear.

38:27.873 --> 38:31.877
Act 5... scene 3.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.483
Good-bye, sir.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.926
BLOMFELD: I want to thank you
for walking me

38:47.959 --> 38:50.929
through your Hawk-Eye program
these last few weeks.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.399
You have something
promising here, Lieutenant.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.633
Thank you, sir.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.635
Henry.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.739
One last thing.

39:00.772 --> 39:01.940
Detective Vega.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.943
Yes?

39:04.976 --> 39:06.578
What about her?

39:06.612 --> 39:08.714
We've been impressed
with her arrest record.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.916
It's not shoplifters either;
it's some violent criminals.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.720
Yeah, she's really good
at what she does.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.422
Are you interested in her?

39:16.455 --> 39:17.756
I like the way
she problem-solves.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.425
Doesn't go by the book.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.793
Tells me that she's
an innovative thinker.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.696
That's one way to put it.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.466
You train your people well.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.700
Thank you.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.708
(trilling)

39:41.480 --> 39:43.081
(sighs)

39:45.150 --> 39:47.986
Should be
minimal scarring.

39:48.019 --> 39:51.457
Just, uh, keep it wrapped
while you're in the shower.

39:56.462 --> 39:57.729
Sorry about...

39:59.531 --> 40:01.099
I'd shake your hand, but...

40:01.132 --> 40:02.568
(chuckles)

40:02.601 --> 40:04.436
Yeah.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.951
See you around.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.855
Detective.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.825
It's been fun.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.494
Let's never do it again.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.629
I'd like that very much.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.664
Kiss good-bye?

40:34.566 --> 40:35.967
How about another right hook?

40:36.001 --> 40:38.504
You didn't say no.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.171
I'll walk myself out.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.741
(chuckles softly)

40:44.009 --> 40:46.812
Thanks, Doc.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.081
You two could not
be more different.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.083
(door closes)

40:52.117 --> 40:55.621
Yeah, I guess.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.101
I'm sorry.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.171
Maybe if I hadn't
held you back...

41:13.204 --> 41:15.707
I'll make it up to you.

41:15.741 --> 41:16.942
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.977
You don't know that.

41:24.282 --> 41:27.553
I know you feel
terrible, Arthur.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.189
But we've seen worse.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.195
No worries.
I'll be fine.
