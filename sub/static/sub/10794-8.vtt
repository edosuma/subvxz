 Destiny intended

00:02.735 --> 00:04.838
from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.872 --> 00:08.176
YOUNG:
 That ship is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.410
Are we done?

00:09.443 --> 00:11.679
We'll never be done.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.514

 You shouldn't have left him
 on the planet.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.416

 You think I don't know that?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.650
CHLOE:
 Everyone thinks we're safe.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.087
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.721

 one of our people
 prisoner?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.026
TELFORD: They're coming.
 YOUNG: Who's coming?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.062
The Lucian Alliance,
 they're coming
 to take Destiny.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.530

 this is gonna end if we wait.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.232
YOUNG: I'm not
 surrendering this ship.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.767
WRAY: I don't know
 if you've met Ginn.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.736
Homeworld Security
 wants to talk to her now.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.705
About the planned
 attack on Earth?

00:37.738 --> 00:40.608
I want you to walk with me,
 side by side,
 for the benefit of everyone.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.276
Okay, so, what are we
 talking about,

00:42.310 --> 00:44.112
some kind of code,
 a...a message?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.012
WRAY: We're all
 sitting here, ready.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.280
Ready for what?

00:46.314 --> 00:49.217
Nothing that
 concerns you.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.051
We need to talk.
 I'm sorry?

00:51.085 --> 00:53.020
I'm Dr. Amanda Perry. I...

00:53.053 --> 00:55.356
RUSH: I've thought a lot
 about seeing you again.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.590
This time is different.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.259
Sometimes with the stones

00:58.292 --> 01:01.295
it's easy to forget
 you're in
 another person's body.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.770
BRODY:
 How can you just forgive him?

01:10.771 --> 01:12.440
No, who says I did?

01:12.473 --> 01:15.543
VOLKER: He's done
 nothing but lie to us.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.546
I don't believe
 he intended
 for Riley to die.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.115
Yeah, but he was
 responsible.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.049
And he's going to
 have to live with that.
 I'm not saying he was right.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.751
What are you saying?

01:23.784 --> 01:26.354
That I'm trying to understand
 why he did what he did.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.489
Something wrong?

01:28.522 --> 01:29.823
On the contrary.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.126
So far, it seems like
 everything you said is true.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.162
About the Ancients
 finding evidence

01:34.195 --> 01:36.264
of a signal
 once being broadcast
 across the universe.

 in the background radiation.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.737
That sounds like
 static to me.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.306
You were expecting
 Stairway to Heaven?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.810
This is huge.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.679
It suggests more
 than a random order
 to the universe.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.581
Possibly constructed
 by intelligent life.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.284
We're assuming
 you had no luck
 deciphering any of it.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.188
Is this the reason
you brought me up here?

02:00.221 --> 02:04.057
Well, you have planted
 false information
 in the database before.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.427
I'm just saying...

02:06.460 --> 02:08.362
Actually, I'm consulting.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.299
Part of a new spirit
 of cooperation.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.635
As you may have noticed,
 we dropped ourselves
 out of FTL.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.370
There are three
 planets in range.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.105

02:18.138 --> 02:19.773
One's a wasteland,
 but two show promise.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.675
Okay, I'll have a look.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.445
No, no, you go on.
 You go get some rest.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.813
No, no, I'm fine. I'm okay.
 No, seriously.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.148
I will tell you when
 there is something worth
 writing home about.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.750
Sorry to have bothered you.
Go ahead.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.420
Okay.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.088

 gathering some Kino data.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.565
Let me go to the Gate Room.
 I'll put together some teams.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.599

You don't have any idea
how much longer

02:52.606 --> 02:53.907
is going to want to
 talk to Ginn, do you?

02:53.941 --> 02:58.512
I mean, it just seems
 like they've been
 questioning her for...

 go to work.

I don't care.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.318
Listen, Rush,
 I get it, okay?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.653
I can see how angry you are,
 but you're going to
 get yourself killed.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.623
You have no idea
 where he could be hiding.
 Just give me a second.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.992
Lieutenant James,
 do you read?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.393
JAMES ON RADIO: Yes, sir.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.161
We will call
 our position due west
 of the gate.

15:28.195 --> 15:31.498
I want two men left behind
 to guard the gate
 in case he circles back.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.401
The rest will split up
 into two teams of three.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.669
One will head southwest,
 the other northwest.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.905
Radio contact
 every 15 minutes.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.508
Roger that. James out.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.876
Do we send you
back to Destiny,
or are you here to help?

15:46.379 --> 15:50.150
Listen. Listen!
 We have orders.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.920
Right now,
we need him alive.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.622
As far as I'm concerned,
 as soon as the Colonel
 is done with him,

15:55.655 --> 15:57.124
you can do whatever
the hell you want
to the son of a bitch.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.191
I don't care.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.626
If you don't kill him,
 I will.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.362
Right now,
 there could be
 lives at stake,

16:02.395 --> 16:04.531
people back on Earth.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.366
They may be
 a billion light years away,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.967
but we still may be able
 to do something about it.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.569
Are you hearing me?

16:12.172 --> 16:17.377
Okay. We've got nine hours
 till Destiny
 jumps back into FTL.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.479
If we have not found him
 in four-and-a-half,
 we are turning back.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.680
Let's move.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.371
Hey.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.675
You okay?
 Yeah.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.980
I still...
I don't understand
why he let me live.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.648
Well, he's a soldier.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.485
I mean, to him,
 this is a war
 and you were unarmed.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.420
What, you think
he was being honorable?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.455
That, or he knew
 how much
 it would torture you.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.397
Colonel Young
 wants us to stall the clock.
 That's what I'm going to do.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.133
Going to figure out
how to stall the clock.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.002
Hey. What can I do?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.738
Hey. Are you okay?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.440
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.108
Look, I'm...
 I'm so sorry...

17:22.142 --> 17:23.542
Yeah, I know. You did
 everything you could.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.149
You sure you're all right?
 Yeah.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.285
Where are we at?

17:32.319 --> 17:33.286
We're trying to
 stall the clock.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.194
Hey. T.J.?

17:41.228 --> 17:45.598
(SIGHS) Dunning, Graham,
 and Lougheed are all
 probably going to make it.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.434
Infection
 is always a risk.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.169
What about Henderson?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.299
This message you found
 in the ship's database...

18:20.700 --> 18:23.503
More of a signal,
 a repeating pattern.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.671
You have any idea
 what it means?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.273
No.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.640
Obviously you think
it's important.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.142
(CHUCKLING)

18:30.710 --> 18:34.314
Yes. It's important.

18:34.347 --> 18:38.285
Its existence defies
 the very laws of physics.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.687
Is it a message from God,
 the almighty creator
 of the universe,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.290
as I'm sure
 you would
 like to believe?

18:43.323 --> 18:46.326
Well, I don't know.
We'll just have to
wait and see, won't we?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.229
Let's go.

18:52.465 --> 18:57.204
I don't care
 if the Colonel forgives him.
 I never will.

18:57.237 --> 19:01.774
Well, I'm not sure
 if anyone's forgiven him,
 but maybe he's right,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.343
that fulfilling
 Destiny mission

19:03.376 --> 19:05.512
is our best chance
 of getting home one day.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.214
All I'm saying is,
 from now on,

19:07.247 --> 19:08.581
he'd better
watch his own back.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.859
We have no control
 over the clock yet.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.960
We're definitely not
 going to solve this

19:20.993 --> 19:23.330
before Destiny jumps back
 into FTL this time.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.464
This time.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.367
Well, we have to stay in FTL
 a minimum of four hours,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.502
at which point
 we can drop back out again.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.405
Good news is
 we'll still be in range.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.606
That'll be
 our last chance,
 though.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.380
GREER:
 Not much time left.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.114
They'll still be able
 to drop out in range.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.284
Check it out.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.853
What is it?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.421
Some kind
 of animal.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.227
Is it something
 we can barbecue?

21:15.808 --> 21:16.943
(CRYING)

21:49.809 --> 21:50.977
(CRYING CONTINUES)

21:57.517 --> 22:01.454
I can see why you
 would blame yourself.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.723
For what it's worth,
 you didn't mean
 for this to happen.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.028
I brought her onboard.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.268
I understand why
 you kept the secret...

22:18.605 --> 22:19.672
Why you felt
 you couldn't trust
 Colonel Young.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.916
But we're going to
 have to work
 these things out.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.619
All of us together,
 from now on,
 learn to trust each other.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.390
What happened to
 following orders?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.626
Yeah, well, some things
 are more complicated
 than that.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.930
Congratulations.

22:43.963 --> 22:48.435
I'm saying we have to try
 and figure out what's right.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.740
Not me.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.844
Revenge isn't going
 to bring her back.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.780
(SOBBING) I know.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.416
SCOTT: You think
 it's going to make it
 easier to live with?

23:10.657 --> 23:13.059
I don't even know
 if we're going to
 find him anyway.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.795
He could be
 hiding anywhere.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.998
I guess the good news
is he'll probably die
a miserable death out here.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.167
He's got
 a Kino remote.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.739
He'll probably
 wait for us to leave,
 and then...

23:26.773 --> 23:28.908
Try and use the gate
 to find his way back

23:28.941 --> 23:30.677
to the Lucian Alliance
 we left behind.

23:32.445 --> 23:33.446
GREER: Lieutenant.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.019
That looks like a track.

23:45.858 --> 23:46.826
(GUNSHOTS)

23:56.936 --> 23:58.004
You see him?

23:58.037 --> 23:59.005
I think he's up there.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.916
James, this is Scott.
 Do you read?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.017
JAMES ON RADIO:
 Go ahead, Lieutenant.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.685
Yeah, he's got us
 pinned down.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.120
We heard the shots.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.655
All right, good.
 That means you're close.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.924
We are at
the bottom of a canyon,

24:17.957 --> 24:21.427
and he is dug in
 somewhere on a ridge
 northwest of our position.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.531
I see the canyon.
 We're topside.
 Moving to flank him now.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.865
E.T.A. is five minutes.

24:25.898 --> 24:26.999
Copy that.

CHLOE ON RADIO: Eli?
 Eli, it's Chloe.
 Can you hear me?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.943
I can hear you.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.077
T.J. told me
 what happened.

24:39.712 --> 24:40.847
I'm really sorry.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.051
Look, I can't talk right now.
 What are you doing?

24:47.086 --> 24:48.921
Are you in
 the navigation interface?

24:51.658 --> 24:52.725
Yeah.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.560
I told you to
 stay out of that.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.995
Sorry, I just...

24:56.028 --> 24:58.665
You know,
 this is complicated enough
 without you messing up

24:58.698 --> 24:59.932
everything
 I'm trying to do.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.635
CHLOE ON RADIO: Eli?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.103
Sorry. I don't have
 time right now. I'll...

25:05.204 --> 25:06.573
Come and see you later.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.643
We need to drop out.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.944
So drop out!

25:13.780 --> 25:15.748
Just warning you.

25:15.782 --> 25:16.783
Great.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.452
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

25:27.226 --> 25:28.027
(BEEPING)

25:28.795 --> 25:30.229
Eight hours.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.564
(SIGHING) Great.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.868
Colonel Young, this is Brody.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.837
(OVER RADIO) Go ahead.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.839
We've got eight hours
 on the clock.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.074
I'll notify
 the team on the planet.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.877
One last time,
 to be clear, sir,
 this will be our last window.

25:44.911 --> 25:45.978
Understood.
 Young out.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.152
Eli...

25:55.321 --> 25:56.723
Just leave me alone.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
Okay?

26:07.734 --> 26:08.935
(KINO BEEPING)

26:12.839 --> 26:15.574
JAMES: Lieutenant,
 we're approaching
 his position. Stand by.

26:15.608 --> 26:16.575
Roger that.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.822
Rush get down!

26:32.291 --> 26:33.626
Tell them to get back.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.030
Tell them to get back!

26:39.365 --> 26:40.800
Get back. It is a trap!

26:43.169 --> 26:45.104
I repeat, it is a trap!

26:45.137 --> 26:46.172
Take cover!

27:01.187 --> 27:03.890
James! James!
 Come in!

27:10.830 --> 27:11.630
(GRUNTING)

27:22.074 --> 27:24.243
Sir, we got wounded up here.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.179
How bad?

27:27.213 --> 27:30.082
Torres is unconscious.
 Looks like
 Weber's arm is broken.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.119
Corporal Lee,
 do you read?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.320
LEE ON RADIO:
 Read you, Lieutenant.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.723
Moving to cover
 Lieutenant James' position.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.791
Assist with
getting the wounded
back to the Stargate.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.926
Yes, sir.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.062
How did you know?

27:44.030 --> 27:46.165
I had a feeling.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.201
When I stood up and
presented a target,
he didn't shoot.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.737
JAMES ON RADIO:
 What about you, sir?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.104
We can't leave you
 here without backup.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.240
Stand by.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.008
I saw you doing something
 with that Kino remote.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.309
Yeah, I was
 checking the time.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.978
Damn it, Rush!
 Stop lying to me!

27:59.011 --> 28:00.679
Okay, I thought
 there might be a way

28:00.713 --> 28:02.749
for one remote to pinpoint
 the location of another.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.083
You knew he wasn't
 on that ridge anymore.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.985
Well, I've only
figured it out now!

28:06.018 --> 28:08.120
Do you know
 his position?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.090
Yes, I think so.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.695
James, we think
we've found a way
of tracking Simeon

28:16.729 --> 28:18.765
using the Kino remote.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.768
Get the wounded safely
 back to the gate
 and check back in.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.270
By my calculations,

28:24.303 --> 28:25.872
we've got a little
 less than an hour before
 we've got to turn back.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.139
We are going after him.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.308

Going to help on the planet,
 and I don't care what you say.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.091
I'm not going to be
 able to figure out

28:45.124 --> 28:47.293
how to stall the clock
 in the time we have.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.796
What exactly do you think
 you're going to do
 on the planet?

28:49.829 --> 28:52.364
I don't know.
 Something.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.866
He's already injured
 two more Marines.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.301
These are highly
 trained combat...

28:55.334 --> 28:57.269
Do you even know
 how complicated

28:57.303 --> 29:00.439
Ancient programming
 algorithms are?

29:00.472 --> 29:03.175
'Cause Rush didn't solve it,
 and he's had
 a couple of months.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.946
I need you to get
back to the bridge.

29:06.979 --> 29:11.117
Even if I could find a way
 to quickly bypass
 all the protocols

29:11.150 --> 29:13.219
and add time to the clock,

29:13.252 --> 29:17.723
I have no idea
 what the consequences
 might be down the line.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.959
For all I know, we may end up
 burning out all our power

29:19.992 --> 29:21.994
before we reach
 the next star.

29:22.028 --> 29:26.398
Are you ordering me
 to do that?

29:26.432 --> 29:31.437
I am considering the fact
 that we may be able
 to save lives on Earth.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.273
(SCOFFING) Only if
 we catch Simeon alive

29:34.306 --> 29:37.343
and if he just tells you
 what you want to know.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.346
'Cause, really,
 what are the chances of that?

29:40.379 --> 29:43.983
Now, are you going to
 let me have one of
 these weapons or not?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.852
You're angry.
 Is that it, Eli?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.187
I get that.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.190
I also know that
 this is not something
 that is in you,

29:51.223 --> 29:52.524
and that's not
 something that
 you should be ashamed of.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.326
Now, listen to me.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.195
Killing someone,
 no matter how much
 you think they deserve it,

29:56.228 --> 29:58.764
is going to change you.
All right?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.367
Don't you act like
you are the only person
aboard this ship,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.870
that has lost someone
 that they care about.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.776
I know.
 Good.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.078
I need you to get
back to the bridge.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.405
Here.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.112
Got him.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.448
RUSH: Shoot him!

30:50.416 --> 30:52.018
(GRUNTING)

30:52.051 --> 30:53.252
What are you doing?
Shoot him!

30:53.285 --> 30:54.786
I did.
 Again!

30:57.856 --> 30:59.525
What the hell's
 the matter with you?
 You had him in your sight!

30:59.558 --> 31:01.027
Get off!

31:01.060 --> 31:02.094
What's the matter with you?

31:02.128 --> 31:04.263
Rush! He did
 the right thing!

31:04.296 --> 31:06.832
What is the point of
 being able to track him
 if we can't catch up to him!

31:06.865 --> 31:08.935
He is wounded now!

31:08.968 --> 31:10.869
Killing him could
 kill countless people
 back on Earth.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.104
We are running
 out of time,

31:12.138 --> 31:13.172
and you're dreaming
 if you think

31:13.205 --> 31:15.207
he's ever going to tell you
what you want to know!

(GREER GROANING)
 Buddy,
 you're going to be okay.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.982
It doesn't look that bad.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.288
Rush? Rush!

31:33.559 --> 31:35.194
Ooh, I've got to get
 you back to the ship.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.463
Go! Go get him.
 I'm... I'm fine.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.131
No, you're not.
 You are bleeding pretty bad.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.566
I thought you said
it didn't look bad.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.934
Ah, I lied.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.236
(GROANING)

31:44.270 --> 31:47.406
Rush, you've got to
 listen to me.
 Greer has been hit.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.375
SCOTT ON RADIO:
 I've got to get him
 back to the gate.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.943
You were right.
 We are out of time.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.312
You have to turn back.
 Do you hear me?

31:53.345 --> 31:54.413
This is not worth it.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.917
We need you, Rush.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.586
Don't throw
 everything away for this.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.488
Rush?

32:04.957 --> 32:05.958
Rush?

32:19.305 --> 32:20.339
She says
 she can help.

32:23.309 --> 32:26.912
Really? How?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.548
Well, you know Rush
 has been giving me
 problems to solve.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.217
Equations.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.622
I... I didn't understand
 any of it at first,

32:38.124 --> 32:41.193
but I would
 stare at it for hours,

32:41.227 --> 32:44.663
and then suddenly something
 would pop into my head and...

32:44.696 --> 32:47.266
And I would write it down.

32:47.299 --> 32:51.637
Yeah, I know.
 Look, I get it.
 You want to help.

32:51.670 --> 32:56.675
The point is,
 I think I'm starting
 to understand it, Eli.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.346
It's like I'm slowly
 getting control
 of whatever is in my head.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.580
Or it's getting
 control of you.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.485
You really want us
 to give her access
 to the ship's systems?

33:06.518 --> 33:10.156
Eli, this is me talking.

33:10.189 --> 33:13.625
Please. I really think
 if I could just see
 what the problems are.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.127
Can't hurt to let
 her look, can it?

33:15.161 --> 33:18.130
Actually, yes,
 it could.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.232
We're assuming
 that any solutions
 she may provide us

33:20.266 --> 33:22.034
are what we really need.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.503
Yeah, and not some subroutine
 that could sabotage the ship.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.304
The last thing
 we need right now

33:25.337 --> 33:27.306
are those aliens
attacking us again.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.941
And that's what
 I'm counting on
 all of you for.

Rush...

34:13.119 --> 34:15.121
I know you didn't care
 enough about Ginn

34:15.154 --> 34:16.655
to risk your life
 coming after me.

34:20.159 --> 34:24.362
I'm sure it was
 that other woman
 she was connected to.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.132
SIMEON ON RADIO:
 You must have
 really cared for her.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.300
I understand revenge.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.003
Your people have
 killed enough of mine.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.239
People I cared about.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.313
I let you live.
 You know why?

34:41.347 --> 34:44.483
I wanted you
 to live with it,
 the way I have.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.252
I wanted the pain
 to eat you alive.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.789
I know it's a fate
 worse than death.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.324
I let you live,
 but next time I won't.

34:55.527 --> 35:00.432
You want your revenge?
 You come and get it, Rush.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.201
I'm going to put you
 out of your misery.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.036

 Chloe!

35:23.389 --> 35:24.290
Stop her!

35:26.725 --> 35:28.760
(GASPING) It's okay.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.497
What do you mean,
 "it's okay"?
 What did you just do?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.165
I...
 I don't know,
 but it's okay.

35:35.401 --> 35:36.702
You said
 you were in control.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.472
Yeah, I am.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.241
Do you even know
what you just did?

35:44.310 --> 35:45.143
No.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.814
I'm sorry. I...

35:48.847 --> 35:50.182
You should go back
 to your quarters.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.319
Come on. Come on.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.729
Eli! You should look at this.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.601
They stall
 the clock yet?

36:42.634 --> 36:45.504
No, sir.
Less than two hours now
until Destiny jumps again.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.239
And they say that's it.

How's Greer?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.128
He's going to be okay.

40:30.929 --> 40:31.930
You?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.835
You didn't
 answer your radio.

40:36.868 --> 40:41.607
The battery died
 a long time ago.
 You didn't come after me.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.844
Eli figured out how to
 track the Kino remotes
 the same way you did.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.014
We saw two
 signals heading back
 this way together,

40:49.047 --> 40:51.717
figured one of you
 had them both
 and the other was dead.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.485
True.

you had so much extra time.

were you thinking?

how to stall the clock.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.064
Really? Because he didn't.

What?

Chloe calculated
a new FTL course.

 around to come back
 and get you.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.111
Good for her.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.714
You gave her those equations
 knowing she might be
 able to figure it out.

41:24.916 --> 41:25.984
I did.

41:28.854 --> 41:29.888
Dial the gate.

41:32.090 --> 41:36.061
Eli said there may
 still be unforeseeable
 consequences as a result.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.864
Well, there always are,
aren't there?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.833
I hope you were right
about Simeon not telling us
about the attack on Earth.

 could have prevented it.
