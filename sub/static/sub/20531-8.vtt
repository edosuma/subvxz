in its infancy,

Is it possible that
the reason why our ancestors

10:34.300 --> 10:38.170
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

10:38.170 --> 10:40.590
there is evidence

10:53.230 --> 10:55.530
in moving giant boulders?

10:55.530 --> 10:59.900
Perhaps further clues
can be found

which were considered
to be communal burial sites.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.780
The most famous of these
is the Hal‐Saflieni Hypogeum.

11:41.780 --> 11:46.950
Hal‐Saflieni dates back

In May 1920,

12:29.450 --> 12:32.410
a <i>National Geographic</i> article
reported

12:32.410 --> 12:34.670
that many of the remains
were those of humans

12:34.670 --> 12:36.670
that were "long‐skulled."

12:36.670 --> 12:39.340
But during World War II,

12:39.340 --> 12:42.010
the site was plundered
by vandals,

12:42.010 --> 12:45.890
and the skeletons
mysteriously disappeared.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.390
Luckily, 11 of the elongated
skulls were salvaged,

12:50.390 --> 12:54.850
and at least one of these
displays a non‐human feature‐‐

12:54.850 --> 12:58.150
it is missing the sagittal
suture that connects

12:58.150 --> 13:02.030
the parietal bones
on all human skulls.

13:02.030 --> 13:05.700
CHILDRESS:
A bizarre report came

13:05.700 --> 13:09.450
from a woman named Lois Jessop,

13:09.450 --> 13:12.410
who had worked for the British
Consulate in Malta.

13:12.410 --> 13:15.710
She had been visiting
the Hypogeum,

13:15.710 --> 13:18.250
and had convinced
one of the caretakers

13:18.250 --> 13:22.130
to let her go into
the lowest chamber.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.680
She claimed that she came out

13:25.680 --> 13:28.300
into a ledge in a great fissure

13:28.300 --> 13:31.100
that was beneath Malta.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.390
And on a ledge on the other side
of the fissure,

13:34.390 --> 13:38.900
she claimed she saw
very tall men.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.900
TSOUKALOS:
According to her account,

13:41.900 --> 13:46.740
she saw about 20 white‐haired
giants that looked up at her

13:46.740 --> 13:50.990
and motioned her to come down.

13:50.990 --> 13:55.710
One has to wonder if the
Hypogeum has some sort of

13:55.710 --> 13:57.460
an extraterrestrial presence.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.170
NARRATOR: As incredible as
Lois Jessop's story may be,

14:04.170 --> 14:07.550
perhaps the most extraordinary
discovery at the Hypogeum

14:07.550 --> 14:10.180
has to do with sound.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.770
In February of 2014,

14:14.770 --> 14:18.140
archaeoacoustics researcher
Linda Eneix

14:18.140 --> 14:23.230
gathered an assemblage of audio,
geology and archaeology experts

14:23.230 --> 14:27.200
to test the acoustic properties
of the most mysterious chamber

14:27.200 --> 14:30.570
in this site, known as
the Oracle Room.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.740
After extensive testing,

14:33.740 --> 14:35.200
Linda and her team reached

14:35.200 --> 14:37.210
an incredible conclusion.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.830
The entire Hypogeum resonates

14:40.830 --> 14:44.210
at the specific frequency
of 110 hertz.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.050
ENEIX: You physically feel
the vibration of that sound

14:50.050 --> 14:54.260
‐in your whole body.
‐(frequency humming)

14:54.260 --> 14:56.560
It was, uh, mesmerizing.

14:58.770 --> 15:02.400
The water in the body's tissue
responds to that,

15:02.400 --> 15:05.440
and your whole body tunes into
this vibration

15:05.440 --> 15:08.650
that's wrapping around you
in the sound.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.910
(gong resonates)

15:10.910 --> 15:14.240
NARRATOR: Sound is created by
the vibration of an object,

15:14.240 --> 15:18.410
which causes the air surrounding
it to vibrate and form a wave.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.710
MICHAEL DENNIN: Depending on the
frequency it oscillates with,

15:20.710 --> 15:23.790
that will determine the note
or the tone you hear.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.880
Hertz is the unit we use
to measure frequency.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.340
It's basically the number of
oscillations per second.

15:30.340 --> 15:34.350
Resonance is basically whenever
something is vibrating,

15:34.350 --> 15:37.270
that frequency matches the
natural frequency

15:37.270 --> 15:39.270
or vibration of the object.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.900
This is really important with
sound applications.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.980
If you take an enclosed space,
the way you get a resonance

15:46.980 --> 15:51.610
is to make the size of the room
or space match the frequencies

15:51.610 --> 15:54.570
and wavelength of the sound
you're trying to achieve.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.830
So that when it hits the ends
of the walls,

15:56.830 --> 15:58.870
it reflects just right.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.120
These reflections
build up the sound,

16:01.120 --> 16:04.170
or magnitude, of that vibration.

16:04.170 --> 16:06.090
CHILDRESS:
What is going on here,

16:06.090 --> 16:09.630
and why are they specifically
using that frequency?

16:09.630 --> 16:12.180
So, you have to wonder whether
extraterrestrials weren't

16:12.180 --> 16:16.010
involved in tuning the Hypogeum

16:16.010 --> 16:18.390
to create this special
frequency.

16:18.390 --> 16:21.100
NARRATOR:
Could the Hypogeum in Malta

16:21.100 --> 16:23.020
have been built upon
the instructions

16:23.020 --> 16:24.770
of extraterrestrials

16:24.770 --> 16:28.980
with a very specific
acoustic purpose in mind?

16:28.980 --> 16:33.780
If so, does the 110 hertz
frequency that it is tuned to

16:33.780 --> 16:36.200
hold some special power?

16:39.200 --> 16:41.950
County Meath, Ireland.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.290
DEVEREUX:
This is the entrance.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.580
TSOUKALOS:
Wow.

16:44.580 --> 16:47.130
NARRATOR:
In January of 2017,

16:47.130 --> 16:50.300
researcher and publisher
Giorgio Tsoukalos

16:50.300 --> 16:52.970
traveled to the Newgrange
passage tomb

16:52.970 --> 16:56.340
to meet with archaeoacoustics
expert Paul Devereux.

16:59.310 --> 17:03.100
Here in this
5,000‐year‐old tomb,

17:03.100 --> 17:05.350
and at dozens of other
ancient megalithic sites

17:05.350 --> 17:07.360
across the world,

17:07.360 --> 17:10.690
Paul has been studying the
effects of sound resonance.

17:12.610 --> 17:14.240
Wow.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.820
NARRATOR: Today,
he will be running a test

17:16.820 --> 17:19.030
to discover whether or not

17:19.030 --> 17:22.620
the Newgrange structure was
built with an acoustic purpose

17:22.620 --> 17:26.960
and made to resonate
at a specific frequency.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.550
(device beeps)

17:30.550 --> 17:33.590
DEVEREUX:
We sweep a sound wave

17:33.590 --> 17:36.130
through the chamber

17:36.130 --> 17:40.050
until we got the primary natural
resonance of the chamber.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.270
What it means is
you've produced a standing wave

17:42.270 --> 17:46.810
from the sound source
to the wall of the chamber.

17:46.810 --> 17:50.820
So the sound wave goes up, and
then it reflects back exactly

17:50.820 --> 17:52.900
along the same path.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.030
(110 hertz tone resonating)

17:55.030 --> 17:56.320
DEVEREUX:
Okay, that's good, actually.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.860
We're getting an
antinode there.

17:57.860 --> 18:00.660
If you put the microphone, yes,
into there.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.160
Can you bring it
this way a little?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.790
That's good.
Okay, that's fine.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.960
We're picking up the 110 hertz,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.920
and it's vibrating
around this whole area.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.750
You can actually feel it...

18:13.000 --> 18:14.260
‐Feel it in your body.
‐TSOUKALOS: Yes.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.720
DEVEREUX:
It's a physical thing.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.340
And people forget that,
that sound is physical.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.550
‐Right.
‐You know?

18:18.550 --> 18:20.340
‐Can you feel that?
‐Yes.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.760
TSOUKALOS:
That's quite amazing, actually.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.520
NARRATOR:
When the frequency is set

18:24.520 --> 18:28.980
to 110 hertz,
Giorgio and Paul are able

18:28.980 --> 18:32.150
to both hear and feel a change
throughout the chamber.

18:32.150 --> 18:36.570
Remarkably, this is
the same exact resonance

18:36.570 --> 18:39.740
that was discovered
at the Hypogeum in Malta,

18:39.740 --> 18:43.030
at Angkor Wat in Cambodia,

18:43.030 --> 18:47.620
and at as numerous other ancient
structures around the world.

18:47.620 --> 18:51.630
Now, I think it's amazing,
especially that you've

18:51.630 --> 18:55.050
come across similar type
frequencies in other places.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.920
Oh, yes. They knew
what they were doing, um,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.090
but they did it
in a different way to us.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.680
They didn't have this, all this
stuff‐‐ they could feel it.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.470
And the architecture
would have been built

19:06.470 --> 19:09.980
to structure that sound, to
maximize it, to emphasize it.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.270
Yes.

19:11.270 --> 19:14.770
Now, we asked a neuro clinician,

19:14.770 --> 19:18.240
Ian Cook, if there was anything
neurological

19:18.240 --> 19:21.030
about this vibration of 110hz.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.530
And he didn't think so.

19:22.530 --> 19:24.370
None of us did, really.

19:24.370 --> 19:28.250
But he carried out an experiment
a little bit later

19:28.250 --> 19:32.920
with a group of volunteers
who were exposed

19:32.920 --> 19:36.090
to different audio frequencies.

19:36.090 --> 19:40.090
That paper's been produced and
shows that that sound can affect

19:40.090 --> 19:43.010
‐regional parts of the brain.
‐Wow.

19:45.470 --> 19:48.100
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
certain ancient sites

19:48.100 --> 19:50.100
were designed to resonate

19:50.100 --> 19:54.230
at a frequency which manipulates
the way people think?

19:54.230 --> 19:58.530
Perhaps the answer can be found
by testing the effects

19:58.530 --> 20:00.610
of this unique frequency...

20:00.610 --> 20:03.320
on the human brain.

20:08.690 --> 20:11.150
NARRATOR:
Manhattan Beach, California.

20:11.150 --> 20:14.780
March 25, 2017.

20:14.780 --> 20:20.240
Neurophysiologist Dr. Michael
Mark uses an encephalography,

20:20.240 --> 20:23.120
or EEG machine,
to determine the effects

20:23.120 --> 20:27.210
of the 110 hertz frequency
on a test subject.

20:27.210 --> 20:30.080
Position this. Do you want
to go ahead and help?

20:30.080 --> 20:33.170
NARRATOR: The device records
brain wave activity

20:33.170 --> 20:36.170
256 times per second,

20:36.170 --> 20:40.140
to provide a real‐time look
inside the subject's mind.

20:40.140 --> 20:43.390
Okay, Brian, we're now gonna
start with our first

20:43.390 --> 20:46.560
frequency for three minutes‐‐
Here we go.

20:46.560 --> 20:50.350
(machine emitting low hum)

20:50.350 --> 20:53.150
NARRATOR: While Brian relaxes
in isolation,

20:53.150 --> 20:55.650
Dr. Mark exposes him
to a range of frequencies

20:55.650 --> 21:00.740
between 90 hertz and 120 hertz
in random order,

21:00.740 --> 21:03.330
for a few minutes each.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.160
Ok, Brian, here's our second
frequency now.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.960
(humming gets higher)

21:07.960 --> 21:10.580
NARRATOR:
This will allow Dr. Mark

21:10.580 --> 21:13.210
to compare the results
and analyze

21:13.210 --> 21:16.800
whether 110 hertz has any
measurable impact.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.930
Ok, Brian, now our last
frequency.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.050
(higher‐pitched humming)

21:26.060 --> 21:28.430
We're done now.
Can you please remove your mask?

21:28.430 --> 21:30.100
Mm‐hmm.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.560
How was that experience for you?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.360
DODGE:
Very interesting.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.400
I felt the most shift
in the last frequency.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.110
There was a similar drawing in
of the second frequency,

21:40.110 --> 21:43.160
but there was also
this experience of uplifting,

21:43.160 --> 21:45.950
or moving out and up,

21:45.950 --> 21:47.790
um, sort of like a...

21:47.790 --> 21:49.960
an out‐of‐body experience.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.790
It felt like I was floating.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.590
Okay.

21:54.590 --> 21:57.170
NARRATOR:
Dr. Mark compiled the results

21:57.170 --> 21:59.220
of the entire EEG test

21:59.220 --> 22:02.220
to see if the data
indeed reflects a change

22:02.220 --> 22:04.680
in Brian's brain
at this frequency.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.970
The first picture,
as you can see,

22:06.970 --> 22:08.390
the left side,

22:08.390 --> 22:10.730
the area that was lit up

22:10.730 --> 22:13.230
was the executive function role,

22:13.230 --> 22:14.730
which is focus, concentration

22:14.730 --> 22:16.070
and attention.

22:16.070 --> 22:18.110
When we did the 110 hertz,

22:18.110 --> 22:20.530
we see that the right side
of the brain is lit up,

22:20.530 --> 22:22.070
especially in the parietal area,

22:22.070 --> 22:25.030
which is touch,
visual, spatial, expression.

22:25.030 --> 22:26.910
Which can show

22:26.910 --> 22:29.370
how Brian felt
his out‐of‐body experience.

22:29.370 --> 22:32.370
NARRATOR:
If the 110 hertz frequency

22:32.370 --> 22:34.420
has the power to alter

22:34.420 --> 22:36.790
the very functions of the brain

22:36.790 --> 22:40.130
and even induce
an out‐of‐body experience,

22:40.130 --> 22:42.590
could sites like Newgrange

22:42.590 --> 22:44.720
and the Hypogeum in Malta

22:44.720 --> 22:47.810
have been engineered
by extraterrestrials

22:47.810 --> 22:50.600
to tap directly into our minds?

22:50.600 --> 22:54.270
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

22:54.270 --> 22:57.570
and suggest
that thousands of years ago,

22:57.570 --> 22:59.610
our ancestors recognized

22:59.610 --> 23:02.610
a connection between
certain unique frequencies

23:02.610 --> 23:05.870
and otherworldly beings.

23:08.910 --> 23:11.250
Hampi, India.

23:11.250 --> 23:16.710
Here lie the ancient ruins
of Vijayanagara,

23:16.710 --> 23:19.800
believed to have been
constructed

23:19.800 --> 23:23.800
between the 14th and 16th
centuries AD.

23:23.800 --> 23:28.470
At its center stands
the Vittala temple complex,

23:28.470 --> 23:31.310
a masterpiece
of Indian architecture

23:31.310 --> 23:35.140
and the largest and most revered
temple in the city.

23:35.140 --> 23:38.560
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA:
Vittala Temple was built

23:38.560 --> 23:44.030
with the mind of creating a
celestial palace here on Earth.

23:44.030 --> 23:48.280
With that in mind,
the king assembled the great,

23:48.280 --> 23:51.410
uh, the architects
and great engineers

23:51.410 --> 23:53.160
and then great craftsmen

23:53.160 --> 23:57.080
to create this wonderful
building that can also have

23:57.080 --> 24:00.090
a wonderful sound
that will please God.

24:00.090 --> 24:03.460
LAYNE LITTLE:
Attached directly to the temple

24:03.460 --> 24:09.640
is what is called the <i>ranga</i>
<i>mandapa,</i> or the stage pavilion.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.310
Here there are many pillars,

24:11.310 --> 24:15.270
some reaching to a height
of nearly 12 feet.

24:15.270 --> 24:18.520
There's a series of what are
called compound pillars,

24:18.520 --> 24:21.770
where you have a central pillar
surrounded on all sides

24:21.770 --> 24:24.780
with smaller colonnettes.

24:24.780 --> 24:27.740
These colonnettes are famous
because when they're struck

24:27.740 --> 24:30.410
they emit beautiful
and haunting sounds.

24:30.410 --> 24:35.080
(melodic tapping)

24:35.080 --> 24:38.040
NARRATOR: According to
the local guides at the temple,

24:38.040 --> 24:40.920
the 56 pillars
are individually tuned

24:40.920 --> 24:44.050
to one of the seven notes
of the Saregama,

24:44.050 --> 24:46.340
an ancient Sanskrit
musical scale

24:46.340 --> 24:48.510
dating back thousands of years

24:48.510 --> 24:53.560
that is still predominant
in Hindi music today.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.890
Certain groups of these pillars
have been crafted to represent

24:57.890 --> 25:03.820
the tonal vibrations of the
scale for different instruments.

25:03.820 --> 25:08.070
Some being crafted
to represent woodwinds...

25:08.070 --> 25:09.410
(melodic tapping)

25:09.410 --> 25:12.030
...some being crafted
to represent

25:12.030 --> 25:13.990
percussion instruments,
etcetera.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.250
(melodic tapping continues)

25:16.250 --> 25:17.660
JONATHAN YOUNG:
The British, when they were

25:17.660 --> 25:19.120
in charge of India,

25:19.120 --> 25:21.830
were mystified
by this amazing quality

25:21.830 --> 25:25.750
and actually cut one of the
pillars to see how it was done.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.300
But it was just granite,

25:27.300 --> 25:29.840
and it was just
very careful workmanship.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.180
NARRATOR:
While the stone pillars

25:32.180 --> 25:35.260
themselves seem like
simple technology,

25:35.260 --> 25:38.430
recent analyses have revealed
they may be comprised

25:38.430 --> 25:41.520
of an advanced geo‐polymer
blend of granite

25:41.520 --> 25:44.860
with silicate particles
and metallic alloys.

25:44.860 --> 25:48.690
But what continues
to puzzle scientists

25:48.690 --> 25:51.320
is that the first basic
geo‐polymers were invented

25:51.320 --> 25:54.950
in the Soviet Union
during the 1950s,

25:54.950 --> 25:59.370
hundreds of years after
these pillars were crafted.

25:59.370 --> 26:02.460
SCHOCH: As a geologist,
how this was done

26:02.460 --> 26:05.000
is really baffling and amazing.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.550
I've heard reports
of people trying

26:08.550 --> 26:11.930
to mimic it in modern times,
to try to just do

26:11.930 --> 26:14.680
a little section of it,
even one pillar...

26:14.680 --> 26:16.260
(melodic tapping)

26:16.260 --> 26:18.220
...and people just haven't
been successful.

26:18.220 --> 26:20.520
So, what were they doing
back then?

26:20.520 --> 26:21.600
We just don't know.

26:25.310 --> 26:28.320
According to Hindu priests,
each of these pillars

26:28.320 --> 26:31.320
was specifically tuned
harmonically

26:31.320 --> 26:35.030
in order to communicate
with the gods.

26:35.030 --> 26:39.410
So, you have to wonder,
did extraterrestrial beings

26:39.410 --> 26:41.750
come down and give instructions

26:41.750 --> 26:44.750
on creating these specific
frequencies?

26:44.750 --> 26:47.420
♪ ♪

26:47.420 --> 26:49.300
NARRATOR:
If the Vittala Temple

26:49.300 --> 26:53.970
was designed to connect humans
with an extraterrestrial realm,

26:53.970 --> 26:57.350
could the performing of music
have had an even more profound

26:57.350 --> 27:01.100
significance than
is traditionally believed?

27:01.100 --> 27:05.900
Perhaps further evidence can be
found by examining the work

27:05.900 --> 27:09.440
of a mathematical genius
from the sixth century BC

27:09.440 --> 27:13.030
who envisioned that sound
could provide a gateway

27:13.030 --> 27:16.450
to mankind's exploration
of the stars.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.630
NARRATOR:
The sixth century BC.

27:26.630 --> 27:31.300
Pythagoras, the famous Greek
mathematician and philosopher,

27:31.300 --> 27:35.260
travels throughout Egypt over
the course of ten years to study

27:35.260 --> 27:39.300
the esoteric arts under various
local priesthoods.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.520
Pythagoras is certainly one of
the most interesting characters

27:42.520 --> 27:45.310
that we see in Greek history.

27:45.310 --> 27:48.560
In 535 BC,

27:48.560 --> 27:52.650
Pythagoras left his home
in Samos, Greece, and traveled

27:52.650 --> 27:56.450
to Egypt, where he was initiated
by the Egyptian priesthood

27:56.450 --> 27:59.240
in all of the different
secret societies

27:59.240 --> 28:01.660
and organizations
that they had available.

28:01.660 --> 28:05.750
And from this secret knowledge,
Pythagoras obtained information

28:05.750 --> 28:08.790
that seems very, very far
ahead of his time.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.250
(clanking)

28:11.250 --> 28:12.590
YOUNG:
Pythagoras, one day,

28:12.590 --> 28:14.800
was walking past
a blacksmith's shop

28:14.800 --> 28:17.430
and heard a sound on the anvils

28:17.430 --> 28:20.010
and got fascinated with sound

28:20.010 --> 28:23.770
and thought it could be
understood mathematically.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.940
SABINA MAGLIOCCO: Pythagoras,
in hearing these tones

28:26.940 --> 28:29.480
made by the metal
striking the metal,

28:29.480 --> 28:32.230
intuited that there was
a mathematical relationship

28:32.230 --> 28:34.320
between the different notes
in a scale.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.110
That there was a proportional,
a relationship of ratios

28:37.110 --> 28:38.910
between these different notes
in the scale.

28:38.910 --> 28:41.080
(clanks)

28:41.080 --> 28:42.580
(piano notes playing)

28:42.580 --> 28:43.740
DENNIN: When you look
at Western music,

28:43.740 --> 28:45.830
it all has its root
with Pythagoras,

28:45.830 --> 28:50.580
and the great discovery he made
is that the waves generated,

28:50.580 --> 28:53.170
say, by strings
or wind instruments,

28:53.170 --> 28:56.550
could be converted
into clear notes and scales

28:56.550 --> 28:59.590
by using fractions
and discreet ratios.

28:59.590 --> 29:03.890
So we end up with thirds,
fifths, fourths, octaves.

29:03.890 --> 29:07.350
By simply taking the string
and holding it

29:07.350 --> 29:10.940
in these fractional ratios,
you get sound in these ratios,

29:10.940 --> 29:15.190
and it's very pleasing and works
very well to the human ear.

29:15.190 --> 29:17.190
So Pythagoras did
this amazing job

29:17.190 --> 29:21.320
of taking math and geometry
and tying it to music,

29:21.320 --> 29:23.950
which then led to the entire
Western musical scale.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.000
NARRATOR:
Pythagoras' revelations

29:29.000 --> 29:32.380
regarding sound and music
led him to speculate

29:32.380 --> 29:35.380
that the universe itself,
and everything in it,

29:35.380 --> 29:38.630
is in a constant state
of vibration.

29:38.630 --> 29:43.890
He theorized that there is
a harmony throughout the cosmos,

29:43.890 --> 29:48.020
and that even the planets
emit their own unique sounds.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.650
Pythagoras thought of
the universe as operating

29:53.650 --> 29:56.110
as a harmonious whole,

29:56.110 --> 29:58.110
which he compared to a lyre,

29:58.110 --> 30:00.780
an instrument that is a little
bit like the modern harp

30:00.780 --> 30:02.700
in that it has
different strings.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.780
Each string vibrates
at a different frequency,

30:05.780 --> 30:07.580
producing a different sound.

30:07.580 --> 30:10.500
He thought that each planet
in the solar system

30:10.500 --> 30:14.540
vibrated at its own
unique frequency,

30:14.540 --> 30:17.170
and produced what he called
the music of the spheres.

30:17.170 --> 30:19.800
(harp notes resonate)

30:19.800 --> 30:22.930
DENNIN: When you look at
the individual planets,

30:22.930 --> 30:25.390
in our solar system
and around the universe,

30:25.390 --> 30:27.470
the radiation that's emitted
in each planet

30:27.470 --> 30:29.310
will be in
its own frequency range.

30:29.310 --> 30:30.850
(electronic trilling)

30:30.850 --> 30:34.100
We can convert that
to an audible signal,

30:34.100 --> 30:37.730
and think of each planet
having its own signal

30:37.730 --> 30:40.990
or tone or music
that goes with it.

30:40.990 --> 30:43.070
(electronic tones sounding)

30:45.320 --> 30:48.410
WILCOCK: NASA has been able
to record sounds

30:48.410 --> 30:50.120
coming out of the planets,

30:50.120 --> 30:52.790
thereby proving that
Pythagoras's notion

30:52.790 --> 30:56.290
of the music of the spheres
is, in fact, correct.

30:56.290 --> 31:00.130
When we look at these
interesting discoveries

31:00.130 --> 31:03.510
about planets giving off
sound frequencies,

31:03.510 --> 31:07.350
we become even closer
to realizing the fullness

31:07.350 --> 31:11.350
of Pythagoras's
extraterrestrially derived idea

31:11.350 --> 31:13.560
of the music of the spheres.

31:17.610 --> 31:20.070
NARRATOR: In the second half
of the 20th century,

31:20.070 --> 31:23.070
quantum physicists developed
a new model

31:23.070 --> 31:25.410
for the atomic structure
of the universe,

31:25.410 --> 31:28.280
known as string theory.

31:28.280 --> 31:32.120
This theory suggests that
the universe is made up

31:32.120 --> 31:34.620
of vibrating strings of energy,

31:34.620 --> 31:38.380
a concept similar
to the one Pythagoras suggested

31:38.380 --> 31:40.500
thousands of years ago.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.300
There are even those who believe
that string theory

31:44.300 --> 31:46.800
will provide
unprecedented breakthroughs

31:46.800 --> 31:50.390
in everything from space
exploration to time travel

31:50.390 --> 31:53.140
by allowing for the creation
of wormholes

31:53.140 --> 31:55.270
through which humans
will be able to move

31:55.270 --> 31:58.860
from one point in the universe
to another.

31:58.860 --> 32:01.690
But how could Pythagoras
have possibly envisioned

32:01.690 --> 32:05.780
the foundation of such
an advanced scientific theory?

32:05.780 --> 32:09.530
The mystery schools that
Pythagoras attended in Egypt

32:09.530 --> 32:12.870
are known as the school
of the magi, the magicians.

32:12.870 --> 32:17.830
But really, they're a lineage
of otherworldly beings,

32:17.830 --> 32:21.000
or humans that are in contact
with otherworldly beings

32:21.000 --> 32:22.710
that have knowledge
of the stars,

32:22.710 --> 32:24.840
have knowledge
of the progression of humanity,

32:24.840 --> 32:28.010
and act as benefactors,
assisting humanity

32:28.010 --> 32:31.390
in its movement forward
and its evolution.

32:31.390 --> 32:34.390
When we are looking at the
Pythagorean knowledge base,

32:34.390 --> 32:37.690
we are seeing something that is
vastly more sophisticated

32:37.690 --> 32:40.060
than what he could have
come up with on his own,

32:40.060 --> 32:41.940
and is, in fact,
vastly more sophisticated

32:41.940 --> 32:43.650
than our current level

32:43.650 --> 32:47.200
of scientific knowledge
allows for today.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.530
NARRATOR:
If the universe is connected

32:51.530 --> 32:53.910
through vibration
and frequencies,

32:53.910 --> 32:57.540
is it possible that we could use
this knowledge to connect

32:57.540 --> 33:01.080
with other intelligent beings
in the cosmos?

33:01.080 --> 33:05.590
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

33:05.590 --> 33:09.090
and suggest that there is
one particular sound

33:09.090 --> 33:12.680
that may provide
an even more direct connection

33:12.680 --> 33:17.020
to our extraterrestrial
ancestors.

33:24.860 --> 33:27.940
NARRATOR: Every year,
millions of tourists travel

33:27.940 --> 33:32.660
to Hampi, India
to see the ruins of Vijayanagara

33:32.660 --> 33:35.120
and witness
the famous musical pillars.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.450
‐(melodic tapping)
‐But for Hindus,

33:37.450 --> 33:40.330
an equally important link
to their past

33:40.330 --> 33:42.790
is the god for whom
the principal temple complex

33:42.790 --> 33:45.840
was constructed‐‐ Vittala.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.800
Vittala is an avatar of two
of the most important gods

33:49.800 --> 33:54.390
in Hinduism, Vishnu and Shiva.

33:54.390 --> 33:57.930
CHILDRESS: Shiva is always
holding the double‐sided drum

33:57.930 --> 34:03.110
known as the "damaru," and he
is constantly beating the drum.

34:03.110 --> 34:05.520
(rhythmic drumming)

34:05.520 --> 34:10.360
And that drum is creating
the vibration of the universe,

34:10.360 --> 34:14.320
and that vibration
is the unique sound of "Om."

34:16.700 --> 34:20.460
The avatar Vishnu
was holding a conch shell,

34:20.460 --> 34:22.000
which he blows into...

34:22.000 --> 34:24.420
(conch blowing)

34:24.420 --> 34:28.590
...and this supposedly makes
the exact same sound of "Om"

34:28.590 --> 34:32.800
that Shiva makes
with his double‐sided drum.

34:36.220 --> 34:39.560
TSOUKALOS:
Om is a frequency

34:39.560 --> 34:42.520
of all vowels combined into one.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.360
A, E, I, O, U: Om.

34:47.480 --> 34:51.570
And some have suggested that the
Om essentially can be regarded

34:51.570 --> 34:55.030
as the frequency
of the universe.

34:55.030 --> 34:57.870
SHIMKHADA: Hinduism, Buddhism,
Jainism, Sikhism,

34:57.870 --> 35:01.120
they all use the concept of Om

35:01.120 --> 35:03.210
as an integral part
of their religion,

35:03.210 --> 35:05.630
of their understanding
of their, you know, life.

35:05.630 --> 35:09.920
Om is the sound of the universe,
the basis of everything.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.720
NARRATOR: Om is first mentioned
in the ancient Sanskrit texts

35:16.720 --> 35:21.980
called the Upanishads,
written over 3,000 years ago,

35:21.980 --> 35:27.110
which proposed that vibration,
along with ritualistic chanting,

35:27.110 --> 35:30.820
singing and prayer,
can provide a direct connection

35:30.820 --> 35:35.360
between humans
and the gods themselves.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.490
Around the world,
there is acknowledgement

35:38.490 --> 35:40.370
that things
are created by sound,

35:40.370 --> 35:42.910
and that sound
is a kind of portal,

35:42.910 --> 35:46.250
a connection point
between the seen and the unseen,

35:46.250 --> 35:49.210
the sacred and the ordinary.

35:49.210 --> 35:53.670
The Igbo people
of Nigeria in Africa

35:53.670 --> 35:58.300
believe that music is actually
the voices of their ancestors.

36:00.640 --> 36:04.350
Yakut shamans throughout
Central Asia use whistling

36:04.350 --> 36:07.190
to summon their spirit helpers

36:07.190 --> 36:10.270
when they're about to go into
trance to help their people.

36:10.270 --> 36:15.240
The Macau people
of South Asia have a poem

36:15.240 --> 36:17.990
that's linked to the idea
that music

36:17.990 --> 36:20.030
is a way to call
upon our ancestors,

36:20.030 --> 36:22.290
to sing them present with us.

36:22.290 --> 36:25.540
CHILDRESS:
This is the vibration

36:25.540 --> 36:29.460
that is inherent
in the universe,

36:29.460 --> 36:34.260
and it's something that humans
would be able to use it,

36:34.260 --> 36:37.220
with our own technology,

36:37.220 --> 36:41.850
to reconnect with the gods,
with the extraterrestrials.

36:41.850 --> 36:44.310
(chanting)

36:44.310 --> 36:46.270
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

36:46.270 --> 36:49.270
that through ancient traditions
of chanting and vocal prayer,

36:49.270 --> 36:54.820
mankind is actually connecting
to an extraterrestrial realm?

36:57.990 --> 37:02.990
And if so, might the same
be true for similar practices

37:02.990 --> 37:08.330
performed by other
major religions today?

37:08.330 --> 37:10.040
We have this in the West.

37:10.040 --> 37:14.420
Cathedrals are engineered
to affect the visitor.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.970
A seeker comes to a cathedral

37:16.970 --> 37:20.840
and the acoustics of the room
will resonate in the body.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.640
It's about sound.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.220
If you go to one of
the great cathedrals of Europe

37:25.220 --> 37:29.100
and hear a Gregorian chant
or other musical performance,

37:29.100 --> 37:31.610
it will alter
your consciousness.

37:31.610 --> 37:36.190
So, devoted to encouraging
mystical experience,

37:36.190 --> 37:38.360
connection
with the unseen world,

37:38.360 --> 37:41.740
will invent instruments, spaces,

37:41.740 --> 37:44.620
so that the human body will
resonate with certain sounds,

37:44.620 --> 37:46.660
certain music,
certain frequencies,

37:46.660 --> 37:49.960
that will put them in touch
with the unseen,

37:49.960 --> 37:55.090
whether that is the gods
or unseen wisdom.

37:55.090 --> 38:00.050
It's a way for us to get
in touch with the consciousness

38:00.050 --> 38:03.010
and the intelligence
of the extraterrestrial beings

38:03.010 --> 38:05.720
that we believe were here
in the past.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.560
They're here in the present,

38:07.560 --> 38:11.350
and they will ultimately lead us
into our future.

38:13.060 --> 38:16.270
NARRATOR: While it has
often been envisioned

38:16.270 --> 38:19.440
that mankind's first contact
with extraterrestrials

38:19.440 --> 38:21.240
would come in the form

38:21.240 --> 38:24.660
of a spaceship touching down
somewhere on Earth,

38:24.660 --> 38:30.040
could it be that contact
is already taking place,

38:30.040 --> 38:33.330
and perhaps has been going on
uninterrupted

38:33.330 --> 38:35.920
for thousands of years?

38:35.920 --> 38:39.840
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

38:39.840 --> 38:42.510
and suggest the proof
of extraterrestrial contact

38:42.510 --> 38:46.930
may lie not somewhere on land,

38:46.930 --> 38:50.310
but deep beneath
the surface of the ocean.

38:56.820 --> 39:00.440
NARRATOR:
Mariana Trench, Pacific Ocean.

39:00.440 --> 39:04.700
July 13, 2015.

39:04.700 --> 39:08.620
Researchers from the
Hatfield Marine Science Center

39:08.620 --> 39:11.290
scan the deepest part
of the world's oceans

39:11.290 --> 39:15.380
with a hydrophone,
listening for whale calls.

39:15.380 --> 39:19.420
But suddenly, they pick up
something unexpected:

39:19.420 --> 39:23.130
eerie sounds
booming from the depths.

39:28.260 --> 39:30.020
These sounds
are quite interesting.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.390
They sound kind of like
whale sounds,

39:32.390 --> 39:36.520
but they can't be attached
to any known species.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.400
It's about eight miles down.

39:38.400 --> 39:44.950
It seems very technological,
but it's very mysterious.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.820
If we analyze the signal

39:46.820 --> 39:49.160
that's coming out of the depths
of the Mariana Trench,

39:49.160 --> 39:52.040
and realize that it's more
technological in nature...

39:54.370 --> 39:56.750
...could this be coming
from some base

39:56.750 --> 40:01.920
that could still be in use
by some extraterrestrial race?

40:01.920 --> 40:06.680
NARRATOR: If the strange sounds
detected at the Mariana Trench

40:06.680 --> 40:10.180
really are from
an extraterrestrial source,

40:10.180 --> 40:13.560
are they meant for us to hear?

40:13.560 --> 40:17.650
As scientists continue
to learn more

40:17.650 --> 40:21.150
about the possibilities
of acoustic technologies,

40:21.150 --> 40:25.280
and also about the vibrational
properties of the universe,

40:25.280 --> 40:28.280
are we beginning to rediscover

40:28.280 --> 40:31.660
how to detect
otherworldly communications,

40:31.660 --> 40:36.210
and possibly connect
with alien beings?

40:38.330 --> 40:40.840
When we look
at all of the evidence,

40:40.840 --> 40:43.420
we have reason to believe
that extraterrestrials

40:43.420 --> 40:46.380
are giving us clues
that help us to realize

40:46.380 --> 40:49.220
frequency plays
a much greater role

40:49.220 --> 40:53.060
in understanding matter,
energy and consciousness

40:53.060 --> 40:56.230
than we allow for in our
current scientific paradigms.

40:56.230 --> 40:58.850
TSOUKALOS:
If you have megalithic sites

40:58.850 --> 41:00.730
that feature these harmonics

41:00.730 --> 41:03.190
and they happen
to be on different continents,

41:03.190 --> 41:06.650
then one has to wonder if,
at some point,

41:06.650 --> 41:12.280
this knowledge
was given to our ancestors.

41:12.280 --> 41:16.660
I think the time has come
that we not only use our eyes

41:16.660 --> 41:18.290
to look at these things,

41:18.290 --> 41:22.040
but to also turn our ears
towards these sites.

41:22.040 --> 41:26.920
Because perhaps
the frequencies of these places

41:26.920 --> 41:31.470
may be the key to unlocking
the secrets of our past.

41:35.310 --> 41:38.480
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that extraterrestrials

41:38.480 --> 41:44.320
have used acoustics to secretly
guide mankind for millennia?

41:44.320 --> 41:48.070
Or could aliens have hidden
clues all around the world

41:48.070 --> 41:50.200
so that once discovered,

41:50.200 --> 41:54.490
we might one day be able
to initiate their return?

41:54.490 --> 41:58.000
Perhaps the truth
can only be found

41:58.000 --> 42:01.500
once we use not our eyes,
but our ears,

42:01.500 --> 42:06.960
to find the extraterrestrial
messages that surround us.
