00:44.687 --> 00:48.077
I want all that is decent.
We must fix these tubes.

00:48.247 --> 00:51.398
And so on.
They want to keep them trim.

00:51.567 --> 00:52.966
- Yes
- Okay.

00:54.407 --> 00:57.877
- Will have to cover them.
- With tar paper or wood?

00:58.047 --> 01:00.880
Do what you...
You cover. With wood.

01:45.047 --> 01:49.837
The point is that if you come late,
go out soon, do you mean?

01:50.127 --> 01:54.564
We pay the Thursday morning
and also said goodbye that day.

01:54.887 --> 01:57.481
The containers are not there
apoyéis for you in them...

01:57.647 --> 02:00.036
but to fill them
and although it comes to story...

02:00.207 --> 02:02.675
I do not trust
sobréis that no unemployment.

02:02.847 --> 02:04.280
Did not know you could do that.

02:04.447 --> 02:06.881
You can not imagine what they do
the bastards like you.

02:07.047 --> 02:10.960
- I no longer suck my thumb.
- What is it we do?

02:11.127 --> 02:13.960
Stealing, collect unemployment
under any other name...

02:14.127 --> 02:18.643
not to strike, loiter
and talk like ass.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.075
And no pissing in the corners.

02:23.807 --> 02:25.286
Prohibited. Is frowned upon.

02:25.447 --> 02:28.564
- No toilet, right?
- It's a mess.

02:28.767 --> 02:30.644
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go.

02:30.887 --> 02:32.923
What is your opinion on
the ozone layer?

02:33.087 --> 02:36.557
I do not care until it affects
at work. Anything else?

02:36.887 --> 02:37.876
What progress?

02:38.047 --> 02:40.515
We would be easier to see
to a legless cat...

02:40.687 --> 02:43.121
burying shit
in a frozen pond.

02:47.207 --> 02:49.596
I have been told to see Mr. Siddons
for a job.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.884
Yes? I thought you were coming to give us
three wishes. What is that?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.878
The blade of unemployment.
They said they did. "

02:55.047 --> 02:58.437
I do not want. I do not know
none of your privacy.

02:58.607 --> 03:01.963
Of course, taxes
the pay us...

03:02.127 --> 03:04.960
but insurance is up to you,
you are self-employed.

03:05.127 --> 03:08.199
To hell with all those leaves
unemployment. To work.

03:08.367 --> 03:11.803
Come, come out of the hut
and teach you how to begin.

03:11.967 --> 03:15.004
You see,
everything becomes easy and sympathy.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.880
- Is there a possibility?
- What?

03:19.047 --> 03:21.607
- Can you give me work?
- Watch and wait 5 minutes there.

03:21.767 --> 03:25.123
You see those containers?
Then they have to be filled at 4.

03:25.287 --> 03:28.085
- This sends Margaret Thatcher.
- Roger, Margaret.

03:30.007 --> 03:34.285
Whatever is on the floor, you pass
lift out the window.

03:34.647 --> 03:37.002
You two can start
for this corridor.

03:37.647 --> 03:40.207
- It's decided, right?
- Yes, I like determined.

03:40.367 --> 03:43.359
- You always know what to expect.
- Shut up. See what below?

03:43.527 --> 03:47.440
Two dozen sheets of wall
precast. Upload them to the fourth floor.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.322
- Your face turns red when you are angry.
- I got signed.

03:52.087 --> 03:54.999
- And you, what are you doing here?
- Have not told me what to do.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.044
Shall I tell you
when to go to shit?

03:57.207 --> 04:00.358
Watch these manners,
could be your father.

04:01.047 --> 04:02.321
- And who are you?
- Wilf.

04:02.487 --> 04:05.285
- Wilf. Where are you, Wilf?
- Of Bristol.

04:05.447 --> 04:09.406
How Bristol? Shepherd.
Go to Liverpool and make crumbs.

04:11.247 --> 04:16.241
Hey everybody, do not want to see
without a helmet. Nobody is going without a helmet here.

04:35.847 --> 04:37.200
All right, Scot?

04:37.927 --> 04:39.155
Stevie.

04:39.327 --> 04:41.716
Okay, Stevie.
All right, Scot?

04:43.007 --> 04:46.682
- Where do you sleep?
- At the moment, with some friends.

04:47.767 --> 04:49.200
What next?

04:50.527 --> 04:52.199
I'll find something of mine,
I do not know.

04:52.807 --> 04:55.640
- And a place to occupy?
- You know something?

04:55.807 --> 04:58.924
Yes, we know something,
Do you, Mo? Mo!

04:59.407 --> 05:01.477
Are not we can get
something to occupy?

05:01.647 --> 05:04.605
No problem. Come Saturday
and find something.

05:04.767 --> 05:08.157
You want one, son? There are thousands
empty sites in the area.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.001
No problem.
We are in 1990.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.998
There are millions of people
homeless.

05:14.127 --> 05:17.597
Do you know how many unemployed there are in this
country? Nearly 3 million.

05:17.767 --> 05:21.760
And you know how many workers
construction? 250,000.

05:21.927 --> 05:24.964
- Yeah, but half do not want to work.
- Nonsense!

05:25.127 --> 05:29.359
There are millions of acres into disuse,
not counting the green belt.

05:29.527 --> 05:31.279
Brickworks
are overflowing.

05:31.447 --> 05:34.678
Nobody should be in the street
in the 90s. It's crazy, man.

05:34.847 --> 05:37.520
- Now there is no God to stop...
- The City of Liverpool...

05:37.687 --> 05:40.963
5,000 houses built
when they sent the Labor Party...

05:41.127 --> 05:44.244
What happened to them?
I have taken. Across the country.

05:44.407 --> 05:46.682
- He just wants a floor busy!
- Of all the municipalities.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.326
He just wants a floor busy!

05:48.487 --> 05:51.240
- The rest of the country...
- Sure, because votaste Thatcher.

05:51.407 --> 05:53.045
- I did not vote for Thatcher.
- Yes

05:53.207 --> 05:55.482
- I never vote, buddy.
- Yes

05:55.647 --> 05:56.682
- Yes, votaste.
- Never.

05:56.847 --> 05:59.566
- The votaste.
- He took 41% of the vote...

05:59.727 --> 06:04.084
- But the other 59% voted against.
- He just wants a floor busy!

06:04.247 --> 06:07.922
Sure, the Almighty Mo
I do not care, you have your house.

06:08.087 --> 06:10.442
But if you just want the floor
occupied by the balls!

06:26.767 --> 06:28.723
- What?
- They come for the floor of Pascal.

06:28.887 --> 06:30.639
- Pascal's flat?
- Yes, it is empty.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.843
Come on, put the leg, host.

06:33.007 --> 06:36.283
You'll have to give a couple
of locks on the door...

06:36.447 --> 06:38.802
and close well before
to go away in the morning.

06:38.967 --> 06:42.926
- Pardon me, boys.
- There is no story for anyone.

06:43.087 --> 06:44.998
Will you let me go, solete?
Do you mind passing?

06:45.167 --> 06:47.317
You can not.

06:47.687 --> 06:49.405
Come on, guys, I have children
older than you.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.364
Lower your leg if you want
you break it.

06:51.527 --> 06:53.916
- Hey, do not talk like that.
- That you cowering.

06:54.087 --> 06:55.486
- Fuck you!
- Do not Mess with us...

06:55.647 --> 06:58.639
- And nothing will happen.
- No need to talk like that.

07:00.727 --> 07:03.287
- Come on, guys, calm down!
- You're all bastards!

07:04.687 --> 07:07.485
- It's a shame.
- What floor?

07:07.647 --> 07:10.525
They are angry with everyone except
with which they should be angry.

07:10.687 --> 07:12.325
- Is the number?
- 39.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.361
It's here.

07:14.687 --> 07:16.723
- What about the crowbar?
- Here.

07:16.887 --> 07:19.037
- Thanks.
- What do you think?

07:19.207 --> 07:21.277
- Not bad.
- Home sweet home.

07:21.447 --> 07:23.836
Dale, Shem, give strong.

07:27.327 --> 07:28.760
Not bad.

07:30.167 --> 07:33.079
It gives the south, Scotland.
It is ultramodern.

07:33.847 --> 07:36.645
- Chain of music and all.
- It smells like piss.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.925
No problem. Mo will clean it.
He is used.

07:40.087 --> 07:42.681
- Always clean behind Larry.
- Come on, I'll give gas...

07:42.847 --> 07:44.439
remove the timber
windows.

07:46.647 --> 07:48.160
Consider this Part.

07:59.287 --> 08:01.847
Here it smells of pee.

08:05.687 --> 08:07.917
- It's settled.
- Fuck me with that.

08:16.647 --> 08:18.399
- Okay?
- Perfect.

08:18.567 --> 08:22.958
This shit was also ours,
until we stole it.

08:35.447 --> 08:38.405
Well, that's it.
What, comfortable?

08:38.647 --> 08:40.602
- Very.
- I hope the hammer...

08:40.767 --> 08:43.361
- I have not woken up.
- I just remove all those tables.

08:43.527 --> 08:45.358
Well, has not been in the news.

08:45.527 --> 08:49.759
Wow, have not cut yet.
That also was ours.

08:50.047 --> 08:52.481
Do you can explain why someone
have to make a profit...

08:52.647 --> 08:54.080
whenever we
water to boil?

08:54.247 --> 08:55.885
Or every time a child
drink a glass.

08:56.047 --> 08:58.322
Or every time a pensioner
turn on the stove.

08:58.527 --> 09:02.566
Before the speculators pulled
paste of the land and houses...

09:02.727 --> 09:05.799
- Now take out the gas.
- Every time you open your mouth...

09:05.967 --> 09:08.845
loose a fucking speech
Do not you get tired of hurting it?

09:09.007 --> 09:12.795
- Thanks, but I'm not angry.
- But we do not want to hear.

09:12.967 --> 09:16.926
You do not understand. Every day I
light cut more people, gas...

09:17.087 --> 09:19.521
And give, and give!
You ever get tired?

09:19.687 --> 09:24.078
The "lumpen proletariat", yes. Thought
you when they invented the word.

09:24.247 --> 09:27.319
- Come on in...
- I'm serious.

09:27.487 --> 09:31.446
- You're the perfect representative...
- And the suckling pig comes to us...

09:31.607 --> 09:33.279
Bye, guys.

10:34.607 --> 10:37.644
Can not you see we are working
down here?

10:52.567 --> 10:53.716
- Stevie.
- What?

10:53.887 --> 10:57.163
Get out, walking.
Let's shoot this thing.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.158
Larry, lean back.

10:59.607 --> 11:04.123
But what are you doing?
Do you not see that there are people going?

11:05.007 --> 11:09.876
Do you not see that there are people going?
I tell you there are people, cocoons.

11:10.047 --> 11:12.686
Do not you see?
Are you cranks or what?

11:12.847 --> 11:16.237
- What?
- That there are people retarded!

11:16.407 --> 11:20.161
- Come, jodáis not the sow.
- We will not stand here all day.

11:20.327 --> 11:22.158
- Backpedaling.
- Take off in the middle, come on.

11:22.327 --> 11:24.966
Come on, Larry, do not be a bore.
Backpedaling.

11:30.167 --> 11:33.716
The hell, you bastards!
Are you happy?

11:34.287 --> 11:36.801
It gives me more to have broken
an intermittent.

11:36.967 --> 11:40.084
You're going to have to currar about
few Saturdays to pay for this.

11:40.247 --> 11:42.363
- Here it is, smart-ass!
- You are morons.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.757
It could have been a kid.

11:50.727 --> 11:54.606
Look at these lazy bastards.
Not work for anything.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.157
The working class
not work.

11:57.327 --> 11:59.602
It makes me laugh. Tell them to stay
sitting all day...

11:59.767 --> 12:02.440
and are happier
pigs in shit.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.077
- What? Already the time?
- For you, no.

12:05.247 --> 12:07.681
There comes a burden
lime and sand this afternoon.

12:07.847 --> 12:09.883
I want those empty flats
for Wednesday...

12:10.047 --> 12:12.720
because we will begin to drop
the shutters on Monday morning.

12:12.887 --> 12:15.720
I just passed through the dining room, Gus.
It is most hygienic.

12:15.887 --> 12:17.957
This morning there
a pair of rats there.

12:18.127 --> 12:20.561
Insurance also
are pointing to the strike.

12:20.727 --> 12:23.287
Look! If you have even taken
a deck.

12:23.447 --> 12:25.802
Eventually, they form a circle.

12:26.087 --> 12:28.123
The uncle of the letters,
into the street.

12:28.287 --> 12:30.562
- Who has got?
- Smurph.

12:42.767 --> 12:45.725
Guileless, innocent, simple.
Seven letters.

12:45.887 --> 12:47.286
Naive.

12:47.967 --> 12:52.279
- "In-ge-nuo. Maybe.
- Always good to have you vocabulary.

12:53.007 --> 12:54.963
Before it was very like you.

12:55.127 --> 12:57.925
Candido, simple... Innocent.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.161
A lovely word.
Very broad.

13:05.047 --> 13:08.005
- Come on, cut off the pace.
- That's it.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.886
- It's going to get behind the stove.
- Be careful.

13:11.607 --> 13:14.075
- Wait.
- There it is.

13:14.247 --> 13:15.362
Care.

13:15.527 --> 13:17.722
Here goes!
Not let him escape!

13:25.927 --> 13:28.725
- Do not touch that. Leave it where it is.
- So we will see better.

13:38.127 --> 13:40.243
Cut the jokes, Larry...

13:40.727 --> 13:42.240
The Falklands
was easier than this.

13:42.407 --> 13:43.920
- Come on, kill it.
- Dale fuerte!

13:48.727 --> 13:51.958
- Have you caught!
- The rat bitch...!

13:52.127 --> 13:54.038
- We did it, guys.
- You're in that hole.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.004
- Give me the bill.
- I'll get him.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.365
- Surely there is a nest.
- Insurance.

13:59.527 --> 14:02.405
Thank you.
Come on, get out.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.681
- Here, do this.
- Okay.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.435
I see the nest.
There's the nest.

14:18.247 --> 14:19.475
Here they all are.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.405
- There are, whores.
- Rat Bastard.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.876
Hell, there are a whole battalion.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.155
The catch with his hands,
the bastard!

14:28.607 --> 14:30.484
Fuck. Are dead.

14:32.047 --> 14:33.639
Yuck!

14:34.487 --> 14:35.715
Yuck.

15:13.767 --> 15:15.200
- Mamonazo!
- Do not hurt me!

15:15.367 --> 15:19.246
- I have done nothing!
- I'm in the shit like you.

15:19.407 --> 15:23.116
If I see you again or the asshole
of your colleagues are dead.

15:23.287 --> 15:26.279
- And now a shell, you bastard!
- Bud!

15:27.047 --> 15:28.321
Screw you!

16:50.407 --> 16:51.760
"Susan Miles?

16:54.887 --> 16:58.357
I found your bag
near where I work.

17:13.807 --> 17:16.241
I have water boiling.
Want some tea?

17:16.926 --> 17:18.155
I could use.

17:18.967 --> 17:22.846
Ok. Sorry,
but I thought you were the owner.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.838
It awaits
from one moment to another.

17:25.007 --> 17:27.077
- Ya.
- And I do not see him.

17:39.567 --> 17:41.046
I'm here.

17:42.247 --> 17:43.521
- Remove those things.
- Yes

17:43.687 --> 17:44.836
Thank you.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.880
Do you serve tea?

17:52.807 --> 17:54.206
A penny.
Bastards.

17:56.847 --> 17:58.565
- Did you read my diary?
- No.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.083
- Really?
- Word of Scotland.

18:04.607 --> 18:06.643
- It's green.
- What?

18:07.007 --> 18:08.326
It's green.

18:08.927 --> 18:10.201
Is green tea.

18:12.327 --> 18:13.726
It contains no caffeine.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.964
- Caffeine makes me nervous.
- Is there milk?

18:20.847 --> 18:22.803
No, do not use dairy products.

18:23.007 --> 18:25.726
Cholesterol, high blood pressure...
Arteries.

18:27.327 --> 18:28.680
Are you a doctor?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.966
Me? Doctor?

18:35.727 --> 18:37.763
- I'm a singer.
- A singer?

18:40.687 --> 18:43.042
I am working as a peon.
It is temporary.

18:45.367 --> 18:49.201
- "Where you sing?
- Over there. At different sites.

18:50.687 --> 18:52.484
Right now,
anywhere.

18:53.327 --> 18:54.555
Are you gaining?

18:55.527 --> 18:58.803
- What?
- Unemployment. If you charge...

18:58.967 --> 19:02.004
- Is it an interview or what?
- Just asking.

19:02.287 --> 19:05.438
No. I have the proof soon.
What sign are you?

19:05.807 --> 19:07.843
- Aries.
- Aries?

19:09.087 --> 19:10.520
Aries. The ram.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.802
- Is that good?
- It is what it is.

19:14.207 --> 19:16.118
- Want to know?
- Okay.

19:16.607 --> 19:20.520
You have a peculiar view
on. How's that?

19:22.807 --> 19:27.278
A flash, a spark, signal
a vibrancy and challenging.

19:27.447 --> 19:28.641
How's that?

19:29.687 --> 19:31.564
His eyebrows are very wide.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.685
- I do not know.
- Not much.

19:34.487 --> 19:35.715
A little, well yes.

19:36.207 --> 19:39.324
The truth is that shooting
the "I Ching" every day.

19:42.087 --> 19:43.566
Come on, remove that.

19:44.327 --> 19:48.081
I lean more toward the commercial.
To that I get, you know?

19:48.247 --> 19:49.805
- Yes?
- Pants...

19:49.967 --> 19:52.276
colored socks
and so on.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.765
- No, seriously.
- Sorry.

19:55.927 --> 19:57.963
- It pays.
- Really?

19:58.407 --> 20:00.523
- There is great demand in the market.
- Really?

20:00.687 --> 20:02.996
- Yes I have big plans.
- Lots of money?

20:03.167 --> 20:07.524
Just getting into the scene.
Just open a shop little one.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.165
You know, maybe
sell from a van...

20:11.807 --> 20:13.684
or setting up a stall.

20:14.247 --> 20:18.126
The pawn
is temporary...

20:18.807 --> 20:19.956
It's shit.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.406
What of underwear
is better.

20:28.087 --> 20:29.679
- "More tea?
- No. Thanks.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.236
And where you are tested?

20:35.007 --> 20:37.999
There is a test.
It's a concert.

20:39.007 --> 20:41.077
- Singing with a group.
- Where?

20:41.447 --> 20:43.165
- You will not go.
- Yes

20:43.327 --> 20:45.636
- No, no way.
- I'll bring some colleagues, we will lump.

20:45.807 --> 20:49.038
No way!
Maybe I'm not going either.

20:49.527 --> 20:52.519
It's a big mistake.
Could be someone important.

20:52.687 --> 20:55.759
- You never know, right?
- The Grapes of Wrath, Stoke Newington.

20:55.927 --> 20:57.679
- I'll be there.
- You're not.

20:57.847 --> 20:59.883
Why? It may be
your big chance.

21:00.047 --> 21:01.196
I doubt it.

21:01.407 --> 21:04.683
- Gus, we can not have that here.
- Somewhere I put them...

21:04.847 --> 21:07.566
- It's raining cats and dogs.
- There are too many things here.

21:07.727 --> 21:10.958
These prefabricated partitions
2 kilos worth, can not get wet.

21:11.127 --> 21:13.800
How do you work? We must
hanging rails, using the lathe.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.401
Well have to get by.

21:16.567 --> 21:20.640
- If something sucks, I tell descontaré.
- Gus!

21:20.807 --> 21:21.956
What?

21:22.207 --> 21:23.640
- Speaking.
- What?

21:23.807 --> 21:25.923
- The common-noun, on the phone.
- What common-noun?

21:26.087 --> 21:28.396
- The Boss!
- What the fuck!

21:28.927 --> 21:31.077
You two,
is not there.

21:31.447 --> 21:33.836
- Over here.
- You know exactly where it goes.

21:34.007 --> 21:36.043
I have told myself.
Do it.

21:40.327 --> 21:43.285
- Damn, look what you've done.
- Sorry, sorry.

21:58.247 --> 22:02.718
You, the top, move!
Benidorm you're not in Minnesota!

22:07.487 --> 22:09.000
It looks like a bombing range.

22:10.567 --> 22:12.637
Hello?
Hey, boss, wait.

22:13.527 --> 22:15.757
- Hello?
- Hello? Hey, Gus.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.162
- Wait.
- Gus?

22:17.327 --> 22:19.966
Sorry, boss,
was a false alarm, sorry.

22:20.127 --> 22:22.561
- Hey, boss...
- This Brave Warrior...

22:22.727 --> 22:26.197
Libby Crow Naked
Do you copy? Change.

22:26.527 --> 22:30.361
Calling Brave Warrior,
"I get you? Change.

22:30.847 --> 22:33.884
I'm busy,
wait a minute.

22:34.047 --> 22:35.605
Say, boss.
What?

22:35.767 --> 22:38.406
Me cago en la leche!
Someone to talk to me!

22:41.327 --> 22:42.806
The mother who bore me!

22:43.887 --> 22:45.036
Shit!

23:43.567 --> 23:45.558
Too bad you do!

23:46.007 --> 23:48.805
Do not come back here, baby!
Out!

23:49.647 --> 23:51.000
Out!

23:51.447 --> 23:55.679
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

24:18.087 --> 24:21.204
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!

24:39.887 --> 24:41.957
- You hear the bottom?
- Neither desire!

24:42.127 --> 24:43.606
"And who are you?

27:01.327 --> 27:03.602
It was like feeling the music
deep inside...

27:03.767 --> 27:07.885
everything was spinning,
was singing and I did well...

27:08.047 --> 27:09.639
and was like...
Look, wearing my lucky egg.

27:09.807 --> 27:11.479
The group is not very good.
I think.

27:12.407 --> 27:15.604
- Have you seen the guy in the corner?
- Yes, I've seen.

27:15.847 --> 27:18.156
- Well...
- Do you think a journalist?

27:18.327 --> 27:21.524
- These guys never say anything.
- Never say anything.

27:22.087 --> 27:24.726
- It's my stop. Sorry.
- Wait.

27:25.367 --> 27:27.164
Do not go.
Do not say goodnight.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.756
Hey, if I do not now
I'll tell a "good morning".

27:31.927 --> 27:33.155
Perfect.

27:34.327 --> 27:36.966
I want to be something better
this, okay?

27:38.607 --> 27:40.518
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

28:07.327 --> 28:09.557
Shit, I must go.

28:11.847 --> 28:12.996
Are you going?

28:13.327 --> 28:16.364
If I leave now, I will lose
another bus. What time is it?

28:17.567 --> 28:19.239
You can stay if you want.

28:21.407 --> 28:24.558
- I do not think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

28:27.767 --> 28:30.679
- Hardly know you.
- I've seen it all.

28:32.407 --> 28:33.726
Not much.

28:35.207 --> 28:36.196
Oops...

28:36.367 --> 28:38.437
Nothing personal,
seriously.

28:40.767 --> 28:43.281
I think it's the most personal thing
you can do.

28:46.647 --> 28:49.320
I do not want to
complicate my life right now.

28:53.207 --> 28:54.925
So far so good.

28:55.727 --> 28:57.524
I thought all was not right.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.284
Well, Mars is rising.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.998
- Mars...
- Yes, Mars.

29:05.167 --> 29:06.839
You're like a cowbell.

29:09.727 --> 29:13.879
Okay, guys, let's see. Look at
Larry in Liverpool with his helmet.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.636
Look at Larry in Liverpool
with a check by wearing a helmet.

29:18.807 --> 29:21.844
Fiama also carries the helmet
and also going to charge.

29:24.287 --> 29:25.879
You, will you charge?

29:26.607 --> 29:28.279
Seth, put on your helmet.

29:29.647 --> 29:31.638
Ishmael, Ishmael!

29:32.527 --> 29:34.757
Fiama, are you going to the bank?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.163
- How about you do you care?
- It checks, right?

29:37.567 --> 29:40.286
- Are you going to charge?
- How much you give me?

29:40.447 --> 29:42.119
Give it up your ass, man.

29:42.287 --> 29:45.120
- Look, you bastard.
- I give you three pounds.

29:46.287 --> 29:49.484
- Three pounds? Screw you, man.
- Three pounds or nothing.

29:49.927 --> 29:52.839
- Fuck!
- Want to go to the bank...

29:53.007 --> 29:54.998
and I miss the food
for only three pounds?

29:55.167 --> 29:57.044
"You take 30 pounds
of the boys this week?

29:57.207 --> 30:00.324
- I do not know what I asked.
- And how they charge, then?

30:00.847 --> 30:03.122
No name, no surname...
Everything goes by nicknames.

30:03.287 --> 30:06.006
What if the check has no funds?
I have a family to feed.

30:06.167 --> 30:09.079
And how will not have funds?
That's impossible, man.

30:09.247 --> 30:13.240
They take enough with taxes.
Not get in trouble for checks.

30:13.407 --> 30:15.284
- Okay, five pounds.
- I like as ass.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.723
If you want me to cash the check,
give me five pounds, okay?

30:19.767 --> 30:21.758
- Four and a half.
- Five.

30:21.927 --> 30:24.919
- Fuck! Thief of shit!
- Do you charge him, yes or no?

30:25.087 --> 30:27.647
- No.
- Do you want that you collect?

30:28.007 --> 30:31.522
- Five pounds. Okay, motherfucker.
- I'm doing you a favor, man.

30:38.567 --> 30:39.682
Hundred...

30:41.687 --> 30:42.836
Fifty...

30:46.207 --> 30:47.356
Hundred...

30:49.447 --> 30:50.596
Fifty.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.486
"Three pounds?
Hey, I said five pounds!

30:53.647 --> 30:56.286
Yes, but you have behaved
like a jerk and I give you three.

30:56.447 --> 30:58.961
- Son of a bitch.
- I know it hurts, Fiam...

30:59.127 --> 31:01.516
- But one day you'll thank me.
- You lied.

31:01.687 --> 31:04.121
He's a liar. I take care
much of you if it was him.

31:04.287 --> 31:08.724
- Here. Two pounds.
- I have five. Happy?

31:08.967 --> 31:12.357
Guys, we made a deal.

31:12.527 --> 31:15.280
I say five pounds each.

31:15.447 --> 31:19.042
- I want five pounds!
- If you already have!

31:20.087 --> 31:23.079
Hey man, I'm not mad at,
not mad at me.

31:23.327 --> 31:26.000
And you, listen, guys.
I told...

31:26.167 --> 31:30.126
when I went to the bank that you had
give me 5 pounds each.

31:30.287 --> 31:32.847
And you told me so.

31:33.007 --> 31:35.885
You said yes.
You tell me yes or no?

31:36.047 --> 31:38.003
Have you told me.
He told me, right?

31:38.407 --> 31:40.841
- My five pounds.
- Me? "Five pounds?

31:41.007 --> 31:44.044
- Five pounds.
- Come, rest, lad.

31:45.687 --> 31:48.440
- Hey, did you?
- Sorry, man, do not know what will.

31:48.687 --> 31:51.121
You gave me your word.
Give me five pounds.

31:51.287 --> 31:53.881
I took the money
my savings.

31:54.127 --> 31:56.846
I ran a risk.
If the check has no funds, what?

31:57.007 --> 32:00.397
I have a family to feed.
Do not give me shit.

32:00.567 --> 32:02.046
- We all have family.
- No, uncle.

32:02.207 --> 32:04.675
- You gave me your word.
- I was messing.

32:05.927 --> 32:07.246
No, man, no way.

32:08.887 --> 32:12.004
Come on, guys,
do not quarrel, for 4 pounds.

32:12.407 --> 32:14.716
Look, this is not going with you.
Drink tea, walk.

32:14.887 --> 32:16.320
But do not quarrel
by four pounds.

32:16.487 --> 32:18.557
If I fight,
I just want my money.

32:18.727 --> 32:21.924
I have gone to the bank
and I've waited half an hour...

32:22.087 --> 32:26.478
and they should give me 5 pounds.
What they should do is amochar already.

32:26.647 --> 32:29.286
You can not ask for five pounds
each one by going to the bank.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.837
- Hey, buddy, do not get this.
- Neither Prince Charles would charge that.

32:33.007 --> 32:35.396
You have not kept your word.

32:35.567 --> 32:38.718
- Anda ya!
- You have not kept your word.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.357
- It's terrible. Terrible.
- Come on, shut up.

32:53.687 --> 32:57.680
- That is, place it in the background.
- Do you, who are already older.

32:57.847 --> 32:59.997
Put it all in the bottom
rather snugly.

33:02.207 --> 33:04.641
- That's it.
- These things make me crazy.

33:05.807 --> 33:07.877
- Where you going with that girl?
- To get her inside.

33:08.047 --> 33:09.799
I'm allergic to plants.

33:11.487 --> 33:14.843
Here, and in passing the wear
the antiquarian to you the ices.

33:15.687 --> 33:20.317
- I only have the truck until midnight.
- We have all the haste we can.

33:27.407 --> 33:29.125
- We must go now.
- Okay.

33:30.687 --> 33:33.599
Stevie, I'm not sure
that this is a good idea.

33:34.487 --> 33:37.399
Sure, you're right.
Guys, you have to download everything.

33:37.567 --> 33:39.637
- Do not be stupid.
- What?

33:40.167 --> 33:42.635
I just want to make clear
that is temporary, right?

33:42.807 --> 33:44.479
Do not want to commit or anything.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.480
Is committed, but
should not be forever.

33:48.567 --> 33:49.761
Ven.

33:50.887 --> 33:54.926
But I can not forget
touring anytime.

33:55.087 --> 33:56.566
Yes, I understand.

33:57.927 --> 34:00.646
I know that living with me
is an important decision...

34:02.367 --> 34:04.722
but not be
forever. Yes or no?

34:05.207 --> 34:08.358
You stay until something else turns.
No commitment.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.319
Something comes up and leave.

34:11.087 --> 34:12.440
Do not worry.

34:13.047 --> 34:14.196
Okay?

34:19.726 --> 34:22.002
- Very nice!
- Bravo for the Scottish!

34:26.047 --> 34:30.279
- Shame!
- "Love is wonderful. "

34:30.967 --> 34:33.719
Be careful with that coat, driver,
is only half pay.

34:33.887 --> 34:36.003
- Come on, Queen.
- Above, Molly Malone!

34:36.167 --> 34:37.565
Is there room for a lady?

34:40.527 --> 34:42.960
- In progress, Fitipaldi!
- Watch out for my plant.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.684
- No one.
- Coming.

35:00.527 --> 35:02.199
Gentlemen, pass.

35:04.847 --> 35:07.122
- Where do I leave?
- Put them near the window.

35:07.287 --> 35:08.766
- Yeah, leave it there.
- I have this up.

35:08.927 --> 35:10.076
Ok.

35:11.487 --> 35:13.682
- Can you put...?
- Do you find it here?

35:13.847 --> 35:15.519
Yes, there are fine.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.198
Let's bring the rest, Mo.

35:37.767 --> 35:38.916
There.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.277
- You can even help if you want.
- No, my doctor forbids it.

36:11.767 --> 36:13.280
Leave it there.

36:16.647 --> 36:18.285
- Well
- What? Well?

36:18.447 --> 36:19.766
It's nice.

36:20.567 --> 36:22.285
Guys, we have seen!

36:23.167 --> 36:24.520
Fuck you.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.801
- Where does this leave?
- On the beach...

36:28.727 --> 36:30.285
And sit in it...

36:32.767 --> 36:35.964
- I'll do
- Hey, you are stealing the truck!

36:36.127 --> 36:38.197
Driver, hurry!

36:38.487 --> 36:40.398
Return the wheel
bastard!

36:40.847 --> 36:42.075
What?

36:43.047 --> 36:44.844
Stop making the cocoon.

36:45.127 --> 36:47.846
- Come on.
- Come on, man, is a joke.

36:48.447 --> 36:50.358
- Shem, Shem.
- What?

36:50.527 --> 36:54.236
- No! Fuck.
- Damn, if you've been all day.

37:02.807 --> 37:06.277
- Look!
- My jacket and my radio!

37:07.287 --> 37:11.678
- Come back here, you bastards!
- Well, since you do not hurt your back!

37:12.967 --> 37:15.606
It will be the first thing you do
all day!

37:18.607 --> 37:20.006
Give you too, son!

37:42.467 --> 37:44.344
- Here.
- Thanks.

37:47.587 --> 37:49.817
I was thinking that is very rare.

37:50.387 --> 37:52.776
Because I got the bag
early.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.818
Not that. I went to a psychic
a couple of months ago.

37:57.187 --> 38:00.099
He said there would be changes
important in my life...

38:00.827 --> 38:04.058
improve my professional life,
that, at best, I moved.

38:04.387 --> 38:07.823
Also something of a relationship.
Are not you surprised?

38:08.707 --> 38:12.177
- And do not say where to put that ficus?
- I am serious!

38:12.347 --> 38:14.463
He also said something about a trip
and one death.

38:14.627 --> 38:16.026
Could you choose?

38:17.347 --> 38:18.575
Oh, God!

38:25.267 --> 38:27.940
- Did you ever get depressed?
- No.

38:28.627 --> 38:32.506
Becoming depressed is to bourgeois
not to currantes.

38:33.987 --> 38:35.306
Well, I'm depressed.

38:40.427 --> 38:42.179
I once tried to kill me.

39:02.267 --> 39:05.498
It's just that I long
that this works.

39:07.707 --> 39:09.618
I want to work.

39:13.307 --> 39:16.982
But there are so many things about me
do not know...

39:19.627 --> 39:21.458
And others that you do not know me.

39:23.107 --> 39:25.667
A call Barlinnie jail,
that almost killed me.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.061
But I'm still here.

39:29.307 --> 39:30.535
And you are still here.

39:31.627 --> 39:32.776
We got it.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.625
Furthermore, it has to work.
You have the furniture here.

39:42.067 --> 39:43.386
Do not you steal?

39:45.627 --> 39:48.141
- I do not steal.
- I do not steal.

39:49.027 --> 39:50.426
I do not steal.

39:51.747 --> 39:53.180
I do not steal.

40:16.947 --> 40:18.903
- Is not stealing, I hope?
- What?

40:19.547 --> 40:22.300
- That it is not stolen.
- Holy shit! To me!

40:22.467 --> 40:25.345
- What are you doing?
- You called me a thief. I do not like.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.385
I have to be careful.
I am a businessman.

40:28.987 --> 40:31.137
- How much do you want?
- 50.

40:31.307 --> 40:34.663
50?
40 deal.

40:36.307 --> 40:38.138
40 pounds and have a deal.

40:39.627 --> 40:41.458
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:42.387 --> 40:46.665
20 and 40, right?
Good boy.

40:48.187 --> 40:51.497
- John, have you seen the hammer?
- No. Where did you leave?

40:51.667 --> 40:54.465
Right here.
I went in for tea and it's gone.

40:54.627 --> 40:58.666
Lucky you you did not
blown the truck. Here they steal everything.

40:59.147 --> 41:01.615
- Ask him.
- How are you?

41:02.547 --> 41:06.062
- They have only won the Kango.
- Here you steal my shirt.

41:06.227 --> 41:08.536
To see that.
Ask.

41:12.267 --> 41:15.942
- Have you seen the hammer?
- No, I have not seen anything.

41:18.307 --> 41:19.740
Got any change of 10?

41:20.707 --> 41:24.017
Give me 20 and I owe you.

41:25.227 --> 41:29.664
- Takes Mo, eight. I only have eight.
- Here, I owe you two.

41:30.107 --> 41:34.862
- Give me one and we already ten.
- Now, I owe you one and two.

41:35.027 --> 41:39.418
One moment, you owe me five.
So I'll take four.

41:41.947 --> 41:43.096
- In peace, right?
- Yes or no?

41:43.267 --> 41:45.417
But why only
I have 3 pounds?

41:45.787 --> 41:49.257
- Because I had two...
- But why...?

41:49.427 --> 41:51.941
- We need to settle debts, right?
- Is clear.

41:52.267 --> 41:53.859
You owe me three pounds
Food.

41:54.027 --> 41:57.383
So we are at peace.
The other day I paid for you, right?

42:00.267 --> 42:01.256
Well...

42:19.947 --> 42:23.303
Thanks, honey.
Okay, thanks.

42:37.547 --> 42:39.936
- Thanks, Ben.
- Thanks, Ben, very well.

42:40.107 --> 42:41.984
- Thanks.
- I wish...

43:14.987 --> 43:17.899
That is, Caroline.
Fine.

43:18.067 --> 43:20.422
Do you mind waiting
until we finish?

43:20.587 --> 43:21.815
Ok.

43:40.387 --> 43:43.265
Samantha, sorry, but...

43:43.707 --> 43:46.175
Could not you sing
with a little more...?

43:47.467 --> 43:52.222
We need a more American accent,
although the song is English.

43:52.507 --> 43:55.579
- Yes
- Can you sing with more brazen?

43:55.747 --> 43:58.625
It is what we seek. Try
sell it, with more effrontery.

43:59.547 --> 44:00.741
Agreed.

44:20.707 --> 44:24.666
Much worse.
Come on, tell him to stop.

44:26.027 --> 44:28.780
- Thank you, Samantha, it was that...
- Thanks.

44:29.467 --> 44:30.741
- Done.
- Yes, thanks.

44:30.907 --> 44:32.579
- Yes?
- Thank you.

44:32.907 --> 44:34.181
Thank you.

44:36.147 --> 44:39.503
- The following, please.
- Susan Miles.

44:40.507 --> 44:43.226
- Susan what? How?
- Susan Miles.

45:10.547 --> 45:12.617
Karen, could not you...

45:14.667 --> 45:16.180
put a little more
bitterness?

45:16.347 --> 45:19.817
I want more agony and passion
in that song, please.

45:19.987 --> 45:23.582
We want to see you live
and dying at once, okay?

45:24.667 --> 45:28.819
- Yes, more bitterness, we want to.
- You know. Bitterness. Hardness.

45:29.267 --> 45:30.416
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:33.027 --> 45:35.336
Sell us the song.

45:48.427 --> 45:51.419
- I try...
- Yes, try try.

45:57.947 --> 46:01.656
Thanks, Karen... Susan.
Do you mind waiting a moment?

46:06.867 --> 46:08.186
I speak to you.

46:09.227 --> 46:10.945
- Excuse me?
- Aplaudidla.

46:11.507 --> 46:13.145
- This is a test.
- A fucking applause.

46:13.307 --> 46:14.296
- Bunty!
- What's this?

46:14.467 --> 46:17.937
Show it some respect.
Do not hesitate and applauds!

46:20.347 --> 46:21.496
Bunty!

46:22.907 --> 46:24.135
Stronger.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.101
Bunty!

46:28.307 --> 46:30.263
- Bunty!
- Applause, dammit!

46:32.667 --> 46:34.259
- Stronger.
- Bunty!

46:34.867 --> 46:37.665
What the hell have you done?
These people are important.

46:37.827 --> 46:40.466
- We were ignoring.
- Yes, they are great people.

46:40.707 --> 46:42.345
Now what the hell you say
my representative?

46:42.507 --> 46:46.182
It would be better than delivering newspapers
instead of looking for work.

46:46.347 --> 46:47.462
- Shut up!
- A little respect.

46:47.627 --> 46:48.821
Will you shut up?

46:48.987 --> 46:50.625
Shut up, you have no idea.

46:50.787 --> 46:54.575
This business is full of assholes
who have no respect for anybody.

46:57.507 --> 46:59.816
- What things do you do!
- We care as if you were my wife.

46:59.987 --> 47:03.741
- Yes Will you marry me?
- What?

47:03.907 --> 47:07.058
- If you marry me.
- Well, maybe.

47:07.307 --> 47:09.775
- Maybe?
- I do not know, maybe.

47:09.947 --> 47:12.825
- Just maybe?
- I put on the ropes.

47:13.267 --> 47:16.498
Listen, Scotland.
This offer is limited.

47:18.027 --> 47:19.255
Next week,
where famous...

47:19.427 --> 47:22.703
will need to kill three people
just to shake my hand.

47:22.867 --> 47:24.016
Oh really?

47:26.747 --> 47:29.784
- Forget it.
- Come on. It's nothing personal.

47:29.947 --> 47:32.859
Nothing personal. I reject
and say that is not personal.

47:33.027 --> 47:34.699
Forget it. Forget it.

47:34.867 --> 47:36.380
Forget it!

47:36.547 --> 47:39.380
I said maybe.
I did not say no.

47:56.387 --> 47:58.947
Hey, Joe,
How is Africa?

47:59.387 --> 48:02.584
- That what is Africa.
- Well, there are sites like this...

48:02.747 --> 48:06.376
where people live well
and in others not so well. Why?

48:06.547 --> 48:09.664
Because I'm thinking about going there.

48:10.227 --> 48:11.455
- How to go to Africa?
- Yes

48:11.627 --> 48:14.699
- Why?
- I do not know. It attracts me. I have to go.

48:14.867 --> 48:18.337
- Want to know your roots?
- Yes, and more.

48:18.507 --> 48:21.658
It is so easy, friend.
What can you do? Are you an engineer?

48:21.827 --> 48:22.976
- No.
- Accounting?

48:23.147 --> 48:25.024
- No.
- Can you do something?

48:25.187 --> 48:27.906
- No, but I can learn.
- It's not so easy.

48:28.267 --> 48:31.259
- Want to know his roots.
- Man, Africa is a good place.

48:31.427 --> 48:34.817
- Sure it is!
- He loves the holidays.

48:34.987 --> 48:38.104
- I love the holidays.
- You can tell that you like a fun time.

48:38.267 --> 48:41.259
- And always with a smile on.
- Why not?

48:41.427 --> 48:44.578
- And what you eat?
- You see, I went to a party...

48:44.747 --> 48:48.535
Two weeks holiday!
Man, I slept like three hours a day.

48:50.107 --> 48:53.543
During the day you go to the beach.
Bars...

48:53.707 --> 48:55.663
- I like that.
- Always fun...

48:55.827 --> 48:57.658
A beautiful, man.

48:57.827 --> 49:00.136
- Africa is the best in the world.
- But you have to eat.

49:00.307 --> 49:01.706
And the women!

49:02.787 --> 49:06.666
Hey, not to be
with many aunts and many parties.

49:06.827 --> 49:08.783
I've seen him in action
and is very good.

49:08.947 --> 49:12.860
- But, what will live there?
- What are you talking about, guys?

49:13.027 --> 49:15.905
- What is the roll?
- From Africa.

49:16.067 --> 49:17.182
He wants to go to Africa.

49:17.347 --> 49:18.382
- Yes, I want to go.
- To Africa?

49:18.547 --> 49:21.584
- Were not Millwall?
- Yes, but I want something more. Africa.

49:21.747 --> 49:23.863
But if you go, stay
without half of the members...

49:24.027 --> 49:26.063
- This team plays fatal.
- Best to leave with him.

49:26.227 --> 49:28.582
- Que vuelva Cameroon!
- Cameroon!

49:28.747 --> 49:30.942
- Cameroon!
- Cameroon Fuck!

49:33.907 --> 49:35.260
Fuck.

49:35.427 --> 49:37.861
- How was it?
- You all right, Kevin?

49:38.027 --> 49:40.143
- How are you?
- But what happened?

49:40.307 --> 49:42.537
- That he almost fell.
- Who almost fell off?

49:42.707 --> 49:46.097
- Kevin.
- The scaffold is unsafe.

49:46.267 --> 49:50.465
- No double closure.
- He just supported.

49:50.627 --> 49:53.061
Do you support? It means that they must
supported. Why?

49:53.227 --> 49:56.105
- We ran out of materials.
- Without materials?

49:58.467 --> 50:02.665
- What? Are you resting?
- We're out of wood.

50:02.827 --> 50:04.385
Come back to work.

50:05.667 --> 50:09.216
- It down and take tea.
- Come on, man, do not go.

50:09.547 --> 50:12.698
You and you, put on your helmet.
Him down and take tea.

50:12.867 --> 50:14.903
A helmet will not save lives.

50:17.147 --> 50:20.298
- In this book we are treated as black.
- You can say that.

50:20.467 --> 50:21.741
- You okay?
- Yes

50:25.827 --> 50:27.226
Will you raise?

50:32.267 --> 50:34.906
Susan.
Do you get up?

50:46.067 --> 50:47.341
We...

50:50.467 --> 50:53.265
Damn, Susan, did not go to the appointment
yesterday. Nor will you go today.

50:53.427 --> 50:56.624
- It's not right...
- Shut up, "please.

50:57.627 --> 50:59.982
Shut up and set the alarm
within ten minutes.

51:00.147 --> 51:03.105
You can not give another camp.
They're going to delete from the list.

51:07.067 --> 51:09.900
You lose trust,
and that's not cool.

51:12.107 --> 51:13.256
You hear me?

51:14.747 --> 51:16.703
- Get up.
- Fuck you!

51:16.867 --> 51:19.540
- Fuck me more, will you?
- Come, come...

51:19.707 --> 51:21.106
- Asshole!
- Come...

51:21.267 --> 51:23.861
Shit!
I hate you!

51:24.307 --> 51:26.377
And you what the hell do you care?

51:26.547 --> 51:28.981
Did not you say you were going to call
a guy last week?

51:29.147 --> 51:32.617
- I do not know Elton John.
- OK, I said yes.

51:32.787 --> 51:36.063
I told you I knew a guy who
was a roadie with him, nothing more.

51:36.227 --> 51:39.697
You could call it.
Or at least try.

51:39.867 --> 51:43.223
"Sorry, Elton, do not know if you remember
of a drunken few years ago.

51:43.387 --> 51:44.979
I'm a friend of his
and this is my girl.

51:45.147 --> 51:48.662
Can you become a star before
Friday? Unemployment is running out. "

51:48.827 --> 51:51.705
Jerk. At least sleep
more than just underwear.

51:51.867 --> 51:54.176
- Last night I did not think.
- You disgust me.

51:54.347 --> 51:57.384
Why does it always
reduces everything to sex?

51:58.747 --> 52:02.501
At best, I can not.
But at least I try, dammit.

52:02.667 --> 52:04.783
Susan, live
into a fucking bubble!

52:04.947 --> 52:07.507
You must do something
worthwhile!

52:09.067 --> 52:11.786
Yeah, what of his shorts,
for example...

52:12.707 --> 52:14.618
And colored socks.
Shorts and socks.

52:14.787 --> 52:17.779
If you want to shatter my dream,
at least do it right.

52:17.987 --> 52:21.696
How do I smash my dream?
You never encourages me with mine.

52:21.867 --> 52:26.258
Do not say crap. I'm listening
I encourage every night and always.

52:26.627 --> 52:29.346
I'm tired of listening, Susan.
You just talk about yourself.

52:29.867 --> 52:34.577
Hell, it's time to talk about
otherwise. Time, soccer...

52:34.787 --> 52:36.937
Fuck.
I do not like football!

52:38.347 --> 52:43.296
That is, every time we start
thou speak long.

52:43.627 --> 52:47.063
- Fuck.
- Like every morning and not because I want.

52:47.227 --> 52:50.936
- Fuck you! Do not go!
- Remove.

52:51.667 --> 52:54.306
- Away!
- Come on and give you!

52:55.947 --> 52:57.858
Fuck you, asshole!

53:08.747 --> 53:10.817
Stevie, do not go,
please.

53:30.947 --> 53:33.905
- Did you see how is this?
- You do not want to use?

53:34.067 --> 53:36.501
- I used to. If not, where do I go?
- God...

53:36.667 --> 53:39.500
Shem, the fool
keeps going to the john.

53:39.667 --> 53:41.976
- No one uses it, right?
- I do not.

53:42.147 --> 53:45.662
- And someone cut the pipe yesterday.
- And where it is assumed that fucked?

53:45.827 --> 53:48.546
- Or do they expect us caguemos above?
- Wear a cap.

53:48.707 --> 53:52.746
Larry, you are stupid. You know
go. On the fourth floor.

53:52.907 --> 53:57.139
The apartment shows. You enter
by scaffolding. There we go all.

53:57.307 --> 53:59.821
Stupid ass.

55:07.867 --> 55:09.744
This building is heritage.

55:11.267 --> 55:15.180
Our company rehabilitates
these beautiful old buildings...

55:15.587 --> 55:18.306
trying to keep all
original building as possible.

55:28.907 --> 55:30.704
Look at the lighting.

55:32.947 --> 55:35.939
As you see, has all kinds
amenities.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.704
And there's a bathroom
you will love.

55:48.427 --> 55:50.702
- Who are you?
- I was checking the pipes.

55:50.867 --> 55:52.266
Out!

55:53.947 --> 55:57.064
I think everything is working.

56:17.347 --> 56:19.065
- Here, it is yours.
- How's that?

56:19.227 --> 56:21.502
- You want a sandwich?
- No, thanks, buddy.

56:21.667 --> 56:23.100
I've done that.

56:23.747 --> 56:25.578
What? I've done that.

56:26.147 --> 56:29.059
God! Who has degraded
and the color has changed you?

56:29.227 --> 56:32.458
I just went through an experience
terrible. It was horrendous.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.184
He was on the show floor
taking a bath...

56:35.347 --> 56:38.305
and presents three Arab girls.
I have attempted to link...

56:38.907 --> 56:41.341
and they said that was better-looking
Yasser Arafat.

56:43.507 --> 56:45.418
To the Arabs,
I will go.

56:45.587 --> 56:48.306
For if they will progress,
to you were of pearls.

56:49.947 --> 56:51.983
So they molas
to these aunts.

56:52.147 --> 56:55.503
Man, is not there
where they do not eat sausage?

56:56.707 --> 56:59.460
Nor do I believe that your wife
eat a lot around here.

57:01.227 --> 57:05.186
And what did she say? "Will you leave behind
ear and then I smoke it? "

57:07.147 --> 57:09.945
- Secure!
- Listen, you tell a joke quickly.

57:10.347 --> 57:12.815
He is a guy from Liverpool and his wife
that are strolling down the Casbah...

57:12.987 --> 57:14.978
and an old Moorish
has on a poster...

57:15.147 --> 57:18.378
"Magic shoes. 10 pounds
the pair. Improve your sex life. "

57:18.547 --> 57:21.698
So the woman says
"Buy a couple"...

57:21.867 --> 57:25.780
Liverpool and says "Give me
a couple, you sure they work? "

57:25.947 --> 57:29.019
"Efendi, Master of Thousand Camels
purchase these shoes...

57:29.187 --> 57:31.178
and you'll see how it works
the device... "

57:31.507 --> 57:35.546
So you put them, grab the Moor,
check it on the counter...

57:35.707 --> 57:37.299
and starts to beat you there dale.
And the old man yells...

57:37.467 --> 57:40.857
"Effendi, Effendi
standing is wrong! "

57:46.587 --> 57:49.704
- Jo, hey...
- Give me a sandwich of these, Mo.

57:49.867 --> 57:52.256
They say that yours are
living in huts, no?

57:52.427 --> 57:57.057
Yes, look, my father's
has two floors, with carpet...

57:57.227 --> 57:59.741
- And I study law, if you like.
- No, I'm serious...

57:59.907 --> 58:01.784
I'm thinking about going back.

58:02.267 --> 58:04.576
- What I am saying.
- Now he wants to go to Africa...

58:04.747 --> 58:07.341
- But if you've never been.
- So what? You either.

58:07.507 --> 58:09.498
- There has been no in Liverpool.
- I do.

58:09.667 --> 58:11.623
You go every fortnight
to sign the arrest.

58:12.627 --> 58:15.460
- I mean in West Africa.
- Come on. Really?

58:15.827 --> 58:17.226
Lagos, Luanda...

58:17.947 --> 58:21.178
Kabinda Matardi, Kalabar...

58:21.747 --> 58:23.738
Worldwide,
with the Merchant Navy.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.945
- It is not true, Larry.
- Four years on the Mayflower.

58:28.707 --> 58:30.823
I've seen these cities in the atlas.
What are they?

58:30.987 --> 58:32.864
Matardi is a paradise, man.

58:33.027 --> 58:37.418
- Matardi is fucking bullshit.
- If you only have stayed in Nigeria...

58:37.587 --> 58:40.624
- Come on, shut up...
- No, man, I've been Matardi.

58:40.787 --> 58:43.984
And speaking of shit, this volume
yes that is fucking bullshit.

58:44.147 --> 58:47.264
Notice that there is no security,
no protection...

58:47.427 --> 58:48.780
- No nothing.
- It's true.

58:48.947 --> 58:53.145
We live here. We must talk with
office and require security.

58:53.307 --> 58:56.185
- What?
- That's what unions, right?

58:56.507 --> 59:00.546
- Why, Larry?
- Without them, we would have nothing.

59:00.707 --> 59:02.823
- Yes
- What we have now?

59:02.987 --> 59:05.706
- We still have nothing.
- Hold on, let's see...

59:05.867 --> 59:09.416
If tomorrow he falls from scaffolding
and loses an eye, do not give anything.

59:09.587 --> 59:13.865
If you fall and kill yourself, do not pay the
Funeral to take you to Liverpool.

59:14.027 --> 59:17.019
At least if you are a union
cobras when you're low.

59:17.187 --> 59:20.099
We must make a common front.
If not, no security measures.

59:20.267 --> 59:22.622
I agree
with the union...

59:22.787 --> 59:26.336
but you do what instructed
the Conservatives. A search of work.

59:26.507 --> 59:28.463
Man, what remedy?

59:29.227 --> 59:33.140
He's from Glasgow. We,
Liverpool. He, of Bristol.

59:33.307 --> 59:36.424
We come from all over the UK.
And we fought for four jobs...

59:36.587 --> 59:39.499
and above
have no problem...

59:39.667 --> 59:42.135
while we may fight
and leave them alone.

59:42.307 --> 59:46.858
We get to come
the Union of Construction.

59:47.027 --> 59:51.384
And of Metallurgy. Should
UCAT call and get organized.

59:52.587 --> 59:56.023
And then there's not a damn
safety equipment at work.

59:56.187 --> 59:59.304
Half of the machines lack
safety devices...

59:59.467 --> 01:00:03.016
and know that you hit a scare in
the scaffold, nearly broke his back.

01:00:03.187 --> 01:00:06.657
Missing half of the boards
and the railing on the top floor...

01:00:07.227 --> 01:00:09.980
and when the concrete drill
jump scattered everywhere...

01:00:10.147 --> 01:00:15.096
and can give someone in the eye.
Give glasses, even plastic.

01:00:15.547 --> 01:00:17.105
We are studying...

01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:20.816
But is that every time we use
hammer, gives us a download...

01:00:20.987 --> 01:00:24.263
cables are not covered,
enough a bit of duct tape.

01:00:24.547 --> 01:00:27.903
If it starts to rain.
All this will blow up.

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:29.261
Everything will be resolved on Thursday.

01:00:29.427 --> 01:00:31.987
Yes, because if the inspector comes
close them all this.

01:00:32.147 --> 01:00:35.264
Do not worry, Thursday
will be all fixed, right?

01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:39.145
- Well...
- Well, I can not do more, right?

01:00:39.307 --> 01:00:42.538
- No, it's true.
- On Thursday, I promise.

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:44.624
- Okay, thanks, bye.
- Thanks for coming.

01:00:44.787 --> 01:00:46.140
- Bye.
- Come on.

01:00:47.027 --> 01:00:48.380
Larry Reilly.

01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:01.459
- What does this mean, boy?
- Exactly what it says.

01:01:02.467 --> 01:01:04.503
"As of today no longer
employee of this company. "

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:07.056
What is written
is what it means.

01:01:07.227 --> 01:01:08.865
- What street?
- Right out.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.981
Another of Liverpool in the street
not change anything.

01:01:14.707 --> 01:01:16.698
Of course I can always
back there...

01:01:16.867 --> 01:01:18.539
and warm the seat
in the unemployment queue.

01:01:18.707 --> 01:01:22.746
Come, take care, bye. And you
do not miss it, and try putting it on.

01:01:23.307 --> 01:01:24.660
Are you OK, Larry?

01:01:25.787 --> 01:01:29.097
- Larry, man, you okay?
- I'll see you, son.

01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:31.497
Hey, Larry...
Are you okay?

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.544
- Yes
- Larry, what happened?

01:01:33.707 --> 01:01:35.140
Who helped me, uncle,
I have taken.

01:01:35.307 --> 01:01:38.299
- Why?
- By opening the mouth. It never fails.

01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:40.105
But that's not fair...

01:01:51.987 --> 01:01:54.979
- Hey, trunk...
- Do you pee yourself in the stairs?

01:01:55.627 --> 01:02:00.143
We never happened before.
We tried that this is clean...

01:02:00.307 --> 01:02:04.459
- Furthermore, the worst is your landing.
- Hey, when are you going to move?

01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:06.583
This is beginning to stink.

01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:17.421
Susan.

01:02:21.107 --> 01:02:22.745
Happy birthday, Stevie.

01:02:29.907 --> 01:02:31.135
My God.

01:02:32.947 --> 01:02:35.142
Excuse me, did not want to upset you.

01:02:38.107 --> 01:02:40.905
- What?
- I never had congratulated well.

01:02:54.427 --> 01:02:55.655
Sit.

01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:04.495
- Are not you going to blow out the candles?
- Yes

01:03:08.467 --> 01:03:09.661
Think of a wish.

01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:15.979
This is for you.
Read it, go.

01:03:20.307 --> 01:03:22.662
- And this, too.
- A gift?

01:03:22.827 --> 01:03:23.976
Yes

01:03:36.507 --> 01:03:37.656
Do you like?

01:03:51.547 --> 01:03:53.060
What time is it?

01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:21.655
Hello?

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:24.426
Sadie, I'm Patrick.

01:05:28.627 --> 01:05:31.187
I heard on the radio.
What?

01:05:56.547 --> 01:05:58.538
Yes, and now again.

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:04.821
Susan...

01:06:06.547 --> 01:06:09.141
- It's the funeral of my mother.
- I know.

01:06:11.547 --> 01:06:12.741
I have to go.

01:06:13.947 --> 01:06:16.700
Already, all say that again
and not see more.

01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:24.143
Can not you come back tomorrow?

01:06:26.907 --> 01:06:29.501
Can not you come back tomorrow
with the train?

01:06:31.747 --> 01:06:34.386
Can not you come back tomorrow?

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:43.737
Stevie, do not go, please.
Do not go, please.

01:06:44.347 --> 01:06:47.464
Stevie, please do not go.
Do not go.

01:06:48.107 --> 01:06:49.665
Please.

01:06:51.227 --> 01:06:53.536
Come, do not go, please.

01:06:55.547 --> 01:06:58.380
Sometimes, you should have
more faith in people.

01:07:13.747 --> 01:07:15.977
I KNEW
A Billy Connolly

01:08:30.546 --> 01:08:31.899
You want the ashes?

01:08:33.907 --> 01:08:35.625
He believed that Ellen wanted.

01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:38.303
She thought you wanted them.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.339
Perhaps like Robbie.

01:08:44.346 --> 01:08:45.666
I think not.

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:47.819
That is the snorts.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.942
If you want,
have to buy an urn.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:56.143
- What do you think?
- I do not know.

01:08:58.227 --> 01:08:59.740
It is an added cost.

01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:03.060
4 pounds of plastic for one thing
that is conserved throughout life.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:08.142
- What, plastic?
- The urn for the ashes.

01:09:12.627 --> 01:09:14.777
Similarly,
I do not fit in the bag.

01:09:22.346 --> 01:09:25.737
We are not wrong. Robbie and I have
completed as of methadone...

01:09:25.907 --> 01:09:28.979
- That's good.
- We will go to service orientation...

01:09:29.147 --> 01:09:32.298
Yes, we'll manage
to leave Canada.

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:33.899
- To Canada?
- In Canada.

01:09:34.147 --> 01:09:35.660
To start a new life.
Right, honey?

01:09:35.827 --> 01:09:39.341
Yes, he can find a job
security agent.

01:09:39.907 --> 01:09:41.225
- There are very sought after.
- Yes?

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.220
- Yes
- And I caught a home and a job...

01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:46.662
- Yes, a house and garden.
- With a garden and everything?

01:09:46.827 --> 01:09:49.295
- Not bad, huh?
- Superb.

01:09:50.907 --> 01:09:54.377
It is very peaceful, this. In fact,
is one of my favorite sports.

01:09:55.027 --> 01:09:56.619
- Here?
- Yes

01:09:57.107 --> 01:09:58.665
Sitúense here, please.

01:10:01.147 --> 01:10:03.217
Let's spread the ashes.

01:10:04.107 --> 01:10:07.986
- Do we put a pebble or something?
- We will put your name in a book.

01:10:08.267 --> 01:10:10.906
Well, if you lie about me,
scatter the ashes.

01:10:11.067 --> 01:10:13.217
I would rather do
us, thanks.

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:15.816
If you like this...
But beware.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.862
- You want to do you?
- How?

01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:20.620
Looks like a crop duster.

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.061
How do I do?

01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:28.065
Squeeze the lever gently
and spread.

01:10:29.067 --> 01:10:30.295
Did you move it?

01:10:32.387 --> 01:10:35.743
- Squeeze the lever...
- I can not, do it yourself.

01:10:35.907 --> 01:10:37.738
It would be better
I do so.

01:10:38.547 --> 01:10:39.741
- No, no.
- What?

01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:42.899
It would be better than I did.
You have to pull the lever.

01:10:44.027 --> 01:10:46.416
- Squeeze it, Jake.
- Ya. I have heard.

01:10:47.147 --> 01:10:48.296
Then do...

01:10:49.467 --> 01:10:51.264
I'm a welder,
this is work of plumbers.

01:10:51.427 --> 01:10:52.655
Dame.

01:10:53.747 --> 01:10:56.056
- The man says he...
- Take it and lower the lever...

01:10:56.227 --> 01:10:57.865
- I do.
- He's trying.

01:10:58.027 --> 01:10:59.460
Quiet. Calm.

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:02.541
- I can, not down.
- It will be better than I do.

01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:05.141
- Leave it.
- Stop, uncle, I do.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.576
Leave it.

01:11:06.747 --> 01:11:08.385
- But if there is no way.
- Move...

01:11:08.547 --> 01:11:11.539
- Shut up, already do.
- You're covering your mother!

01:11:12.027 --> 01:11:14.746
Do not shake so much,
the wind carries it.

01:11:21.587 --> 01:11:23.100
Apart that.

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:27.578
- De puta madre. Thank you very much.
- Holy Virgin!

01:11:27.747 --> 01:11:30.819
- Shut up.
- Think of where they are...

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:35.097
- Be so kind as to go out.
- Great, now we check the colleague.

01:11:35.267 --> 01:11:37.906
- Will that have spread throughout?
- What about that?

01:11:38.067 --> 01:11:39.978
Everything is planned, yes,
do not worry.

01:11:40.147 --> 01:11:43.583
Do not forget where they are.
The ceremony is over.

01:11:43.747 --> 01:11:45.100
Thank you very much.

01:12:30.707 --> 01:12:33.505
- Sorry, honey.
- Watch where you go...

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:37.706
- Yes, sorry.
- Thanks. Here, take it.

01:14:18.427 --> 01:14:20.304
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:22.267 --> 01:14:24.178
Still, I know what I'm doing.

01:14:28.467 --> 01:14:30.981
I want you out of here
tonight, okay?

01:14:32.507 --> 01:14:33.656
Tonight.

01:14:56.627 --> 01:14:57.946
All right, Stevie?

01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:10.256
Where the fuck you been
these last 4 days?

01:15:10.427 --> 01:15:11.860
My mother is dead.

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:14.541
Your mother is dead.

01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:20.539
Okay, okay, change
and I see you in five minutes, okay?

01:15:23.907 --> 01:15:26.979
- Fix the rotting wood.
- Okay, I do.

01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:30.103
IF SOMEONE URINE ON THE FLOOR
BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY.

01:15:51.667 --> 01:15:52.861
No, man...

01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:59.296
- Have you seen Stevie?
- Just go there.

01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:00.900
You are here, sweetheart.

01:16:08.347 --> 01:16:09.780
I want to talk to you.

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:15.495
Nothing to say.

01:16:16.387 --> 01:16:17.979
Sorry, what did you say?

01:16:23.147 --> 01:16:24.899
I want to talk to you.

01:16:25.587 --> 01:16:26.815
Nothing to say.

01:16:27.347 --> 01:16:28.905
All to say.

01:16:29.467 --> 01:16:32.061
I am a human being
and deserve respect.

01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:37.225
He belongs to 50%
of this relationship, do not forget.

01:16:40.427 --> 01:16:44.864
My God, do not give an inch,
Right? Okay, so what?

01:16:45.027 --> 01:16:47.780
I occasionally peak,
but not the end of the world.

01:16:47.947 --> 01:16:50.905
- I know what I'm doing.
- You have no fucking idea!

01:16:52.347 --> 01:16:55.419
You are dazed, as if any
time out to get the party started.

01:16:55.587 --> 01:16:57.817
- I...
- Do not tell me what you are!

01:17:00.387 --> 01:17:02.617
My brother was
counselor junkies.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:07.106
One day he went to see a couple who
were in a methadone program.

01:17:08.187 --> 01:17:09.586
We were trying.

01:17:10.627 --> 01:17:11.776
Or so he thought.

01:17:13.147 --> 01:17:15.024
When he arrived,
were on the couch...

01:17:15.907 --> 01:17:18.262
surrounded by towels
soaked in blood...

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:22.304
they had no veins in her arms,
that did not stop the bleeding.

01:17:23.267 --> 01:17:25.656
He had seen things like that.
I did not want help.

01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:28.100
But I had to.

01:17:28.387 --> 01:17:30.617
"You can not turn you and go"
he said.

01:17:31.267 --> 01:17:32.495
So we helped them...

01:17:33.027 --> 01:17:35.143
Les chutes in plants
feet.

01:17:35.787 --> 01:17:38.620
It was the only place
veins were not click them.

01:17:41.467 --> 01:17:42.820
Can you imagine?

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:46.659
It's a fucking nightmare.
And it will never better.

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:48.295
You're a junkie.
Go.

01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:50.856
I'm not, dammit!

01:17:51.707 --> 01:17:54.505
That's not what you decide.
You do not choice.

01:17:54.667 --> 01:17:57.943
You have no choice.
Never going to stop being so.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.098
You have no idea,
no fucking idea.

01:18:00.267 --> 01:18:03.577
So far, nothing,
because you love other things.

01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:05.419
What will happen when
everything starts to get bored...

01:18:05.587 --> 01:18:09.182
stuff yourself at all, to sell
furniture and selling it all?

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:11.657
What you get for ass, motherfucker.

01:18:16.027 --> 01:18:18.018
I do not know, dammit.

01:18:21.587 --> 01:18:25.375
I do not know.
I do not know, dammit.

01:18:26.427 --> 01:18:29.066
I would never hurt you,
Never!

01:18:32.467 --> 01:18:36.016
I've done everything
to make you feel good...

01:18:36.187 --> 01:18:38.781
to put a smile
in your fucking face.

01:18:47.907 --> 01:18:51.502
It is you who should have some
more faith in people sometimes.

01:18:55.187 --> 01:18:56.540
Hey, this couple...

01:18:59.627 --> 01:19:01.424
were my brother and his wife.

01:20:02.627 --> 01:20:04.219
- Comes someone.
- The Scottish puto.

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:06.662
You still here,
Scottish shit?

01:20:08.827 --> 01:20:09.976
Que os den!

01:20:22.787 --> 01:20:24.505
Now, now...

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:26.101
We...

01:20:31.107 --> 01:20:32.984
- Later, dude.
- See ya, guys.

01:20:35.507 --> 01:20:37.225
Look at that.
Look, look.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:40.144
Love hurts.
Look...

01:20:44.147 --> 01:20:45.136
- What happened?
- A fight.

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.901
He says it's a fight.
That's a bite, kid.

01:20:48.067 --> 01:20:50.297
- It has been furious with the missus...
- Is not that a bite?

01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:51.820
- No.
- Yes it is.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.502
You wanted to go out dancing
the ballroom, Steve.

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:01.783
"You took the first prize
or the second?

01:21:01.947 --> 01:21:04.063
They took
three second prizes.

01:21:04.587 --> 01:21:08.739
I think going with women
you do not agree, boy.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:10.465
Búscatelas elsewhere.

01:21:10.827 --> 01:21:15.378
IF SOMEONE urinated on the floor...
"Well, we piss on your face. "

01:21:17.867 --> 01:21:21.337
The Sacred Host, Online Shopping.
I have enough problems here.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:25.859
You could move a little there,
have to work here.

01:21:26.587 --> 01:21:30.182
Sure, it is not, wafers,
that is what touches his nose.

01:21:32.347 --> 01:21:36.465
- How the overlapping ye here?
- A 75-mm.

01:21:37.107 --> 01:21:40.941
Leave him four inches,
if not wasteful.

01:21:41.387 --> 01:21:43.855
How come you have not
anything here? Come on.

01:21:46.107 --> 01:21:47.938
What happens then?

01:21:48.307 --> 01:21:51.105
You'd be better with a knife
sharp, you know?

01:21:51.587 --> 01:21:54.385
What the hell is cooking there?
What's happening here?

01:21:55.187 --> 01:21:57.701
- No rolls.
- I know!

01:21:57.867 --> 01:22:01.098
Is that why you retrasáis?
Who is in charge there?

01:22:01.267 --> 01:22:04.418
- Who is in charge there?
- Here are people with nothing to do.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:07.147
There are people
with nothing to do!

01:22:08.267 --> 01:22:10.906
Let me.
Since I got it.

01:22:11.067 --> 01:22:12.978
I think what is happening.

01:22:13.147 --> 01:22:15.707
- What's here?
- We have roll, Gus.

01:22:15.867 --> 01:22:19.303
Why do you think you yell?
Of course there's rolls.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:22.300
- Where are the scrolls?
- They have not brought.

01:22:22.467 --> 01:22:25.379
Why not have brought them?
I saw it was the fucking truck.

01:22:25.547 --> 01:22:26.821
Came and went.

01:22:26.987 --> 01:22:28.943
Is that if not done the paperwork,
No rolls.

01:22:29.107 --> 01:22:32.179
What paperwork? All paperwork
is done, host.

01:22:33.387 --> 01:22:35.947
- Look, it has left the phone.
- What?

01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:37.666
It has left the phone.

01:22:38.347 --> 01:22:41.862
- Throw it away.
- Only after calling mom...

01:22:42.307 --> 01:22:44.946
Will be happy,
years that do not call.

01:22:50.707 --> 01:22:51.856
Hello...

01:22:52.027 --> 01:22:53.176
Hello, mother.

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:56.418
Yes, I'm Seamus, Shem.

01:22:57.907 --> 01:23:01.582
Not yet.
I'm fine.

01:23:01.867 --> 01:23:04.586
Take the fucking bike
and find it, hosts!

01:23:04.827 --> 01:23:07.625
Above is all standing
because of you, useless!

01:23:07.787 --> 01:23:10.221
- I'll fix me, dammit.
- Here we stand...

01:23:10.387 --> 01:23:12.537
go to catch the guy
rolls, man.

01:23:13.787 --> 01:23:15.982
- It's me, the foreman.
- You have an attitude problem.

01:23:16.387 --> 01:23:19.106
- I am a top, just fine.
- Shem, Shem...

01:23:19.267 --> 01:23:22.145
Smart,
Are you kidding?

01:23:22.627 --> 01:23:24.697
- It's a local call.
- And a local jerk...

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:28.223
- I do not like wise guys. Mick!
- Tell me.

01:23:28.387 --> 01:23:31.902
- That, pinching the roof.
- Do not be like it was a joke.

01:23:32.067 --> 01:23:35.184
I've been wound to
you hanging and you have.

01:23:35.347 --> 01:23:39.659
- I give you 10 pence.
- And a prick! Take, now!

01:23:41.427 --> 01:23:43.736
My phone!
What have you done?

01:23:47.107 --> 01:23:48.506
Call the police.

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:50.464
Nice shot.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.422
- Had long been seeking him.
- Champion.

01:24:02.627 --> 01:24:04.777
- He should have been stronger.
- Yes

01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:13.821
- Shem!
- Take it easy!

01:24:15.227 --> 01:24:16.785
Police brutality!

01:24:24.187 --> 01:24:25.336
Bastards!

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.658
There are many ways
to skin a cat.

01:24:28.307 --> 01:24:31.219
- It joderemos them.
- Yes

01:24:31.387 --> 01:24:33.105

01:24:35.187 --> 01:24:36.336
Yes

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.743
- What time is it?
- Time to go. Call DES.

01:24:52.907 --> 01:24:54.977
- Dessie!
- Dessie!

01:24:55.187 --> 01:24:56.779
- Dessie!
- Damn, he's gone.

01:24:56.947 --> 01:24:58.938
Come on, Dessie, dammit...

01:24:59.107 --> 01:25:01.063
- He's gone.
- You think?

01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:06.704
Fiam, arrived over the weekend,
I expect these kinky!

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:08.266
Saturday Night!

01:25:09.307 --> 01:25:11.298
Saturday Night...

01:25:27.867 --> 01:25:29.016
Fiama!

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:35.055
Fiama!

01:25:39.027 --> 01:25:40.176
Fiama!

01:25:44.387 --> 01:25:46.537
Are not the Des brochures?

01:25:47.987 --> 01:25:49.215
Dessie!

01:25:50.067 --> 01:25:51.386
Something wrong.

01:25:53.587 --> 01:25:56.101
Steve! Mo!

01:25:56.587 --> 01:25:57.815
Dessie!

01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:01.341
Steve!

01:26:04.707 --> 01:26:06.777

01:26:07.947 --> 01:26:09.141
Mo!

01:26:10.147 --> 01:26:11.785
Dessie! Shit, Mo!

01:26:16.107 --> 01:26:17.335
- Take my arm.
- I can not!

01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:19.304
Hell, wait... Mo!

01:26:20.267 --> 01:26:23.259
Hell, Steve,

01:26:24.027 --> 01:26:26.382
- Mo!
- Come on!

01:26:29.347 --> 01:26:32.259
- Come on up.
- I'm slipping.

01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:34.226
No! No!

01:26:36.467 --> 01:26:39.777
- Shit.
- Fuck.

01:26:42.747 --> 01:26:44.021
Help!

01:26:44.707 --> 01:26:46.026
Hurry!

01:26:46.787 --> 01:26:48.857
Ambulance! Now!
Hurry up, dammit!

01:26:49.267 --> 01:26:50.620
Do not touch.

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:58.262
- Wait, Des, man. Crap.
- The medicine cabinet.

01:26:58.427 --> 01:26:59.940
A whore ambulance.

01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:05.500

01:27:05.827 --> 01:27:10.184

01:27:17.707 --> 01:27:19.698
- What happened?

01:27:20.227 --> 01:27:22.377
- Does anyone know...?
- It has fallen.

01:27:33.307 --> 01:27:34.535
Step, please...

01:27:35.227 --> 01:27:36.421
Step...

01:27:37.747 --> 01:27:39.021
Step...

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:55.703
Okay. Thank you.

01:27:55.867 --> 01:27:58.222
Excuse me, how is
the boy with whom I come in?

01:27:58.387 --> 01:27:59.786
Yes, your full name?

01:28:00.867 --> 01:28:02.300
Why do you want my name?

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:07.106
- Well, is you a relative?
- No.

01:28:07.267 --> 01:28:09.940
- Okay, so what the name of it?
- Desmond Haynes.

01:28:10.107 --> 01:28:12.063
- Desmond Haynes.
- That's it.

01:28:14.227 --> 01:28:16.377
Are you sure?
This puts another name.

01:28:17.827 --> 01:28:22.184
- Yes
- Leroy Winston. Do you name?

01:28:23.027 --> 01:28:24.619
- Yes
- Okay.

01:28:26.347 --> 01:28:30.101
- Okay, so what's it called?

01:28:30.267 --> 01:28:33.259

01:28:33.427 --> 01:28:34.621
Ok.

01:28:36.467 --> 01:28:40.665
And I have to say your name,
too. If it looks good.

01:28:44.787 --> 01:28:46.106
His name?

01:29:23.627 --> 01:29:25.379
- Hit patadon one at the door.
- What?

01:29:25.547 --> 01:29:28.778
- Patadon.
- If I have a fucking key here.

01:29:30.107 --> 01:29:31.381
Fucking thief.

01:29:44.027 --> 01:29:46.018
- This?
- Yes

01:29:46.187 --> 01:29:47.779
- Okay.
- Did you miss?

01:30:02.107 --> 01:30:03.460
Ok. Basta.

01:30:29.427 --> 01:30:30.576
Brownie...

01:30:32.107 --> 01:30:33.256
Brownie...

01:30:35.267 --> 01:30:36.495
Brownie.

01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:40.546
Crap.

01:30:41.507 --> 01:30:43.577
Quiet, very well.

01:30:44.227 --> 01:30:45.455
Come on, baby...

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.859
Come on.
Stay there.

01:30:48.467 --> 01:30:50.856
Stay there.
Stay there.

01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:52.426
No problem.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:54.626
Come on, nothing happens.

01:30:56.867 --> 01:30:59.142
Stay. Brownie!

01:31:00.187 --> 01:31:01.905
Dog idiot.
Brownie!

01:31:03.907 --> 01:31:05.056
Brownie.

01:31:07.507 --> 01:31:08.826
Mother.

01:31:09.587 --> 01:31:10.736
Brownie!

01:31:14.627 --> 01:31:16.583
Basta.
Basta!

01:31:17.907 --> 01:31:19.056
With firefighters.

01:31:19.867 --> 01:31:22.176
No. They're attacking.

01:31:24.107 --> 01:31:26.302
The police, no! It's my dog
which is attacking me.

01:31:26.467 --> 01:31:27.536
Basta!
