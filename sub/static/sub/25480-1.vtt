[car door closes]

02:09.939 --> 02:11.437
There he is.

02:15.438 --> 02:17.737
Is this your first job?

02:17.739 --> 02:19.039
- My first job?
- Hm.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.669
I've never killed a man

02:21.671 --> 02:23.437
if that's what you mean.

02:26.273 --> 02:28.539
It's not as hard
as you might think.

02:30.272 --> 02:33.471
- Depends on the man.
- Which man?

02:33.473 --> 02:36.072
The target, or the man
doing the killing?

02:37.105 --> 02:38.703
[scoffs]

02:38.705 --> 02:39.971
Both.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.737
[gun cocks]

02:54.739 --> 02:57.971
Tell me, friend, what did you
do before the war?

03:00.339 --> 03:03.073
I was a baseball player.

03:03.971 --> 03:05.337
[scoffs]

03:05.339 --> 03:07.437
You know baseball?

03:07.439 --> 03:09.103
Oh, baseball.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.170
Like Joe DiMaggio.

03:11.672 --> 03:13.505
<i>Did he ever kill anyone?</i>

03:15.306 --> 03:17.103
Not that I know of.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.038
[instrumental music]

03:21.740 --> 03:23.539
Good luck, my friend.

03:27.072 --> 03:28.671
You'll be fine.

03:31.072 --> 03:33.672
Just do it before
the <i>Gestapo</i> figures it out.

03:34.537 --> 03:36.404
I'll try.

04:16.139 --> 04:19.635
Two out top of the third,
man on first.

04:19.637 --> 04:21.569
Moe Berg still in the catcher.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.534
<i>Fifteen years in the league
and still standing.</i>

04:25.536 --> 04:27.102
<i>How long can this guy go on?</i>

04:29.371 --> 04:30.970
<i>Runner takes his lead.</i>

04:33.838 --> 04:35.237
<i>Moe calls the sign.</i>

04:40.904 --> 04:42.736
<i>Okay, now here's the pitch.</i>

04:42.738 --> 04:44.001
<i>The runner goes.</i>

04:44.937 --> 04:46.536
<i>Berg throws down to second.</i>

04:46.538 --> 04:48.035
[crowd cheering]

04:48.037 --> 04:49.103
<i>Got him.</i>

04:49.105 --> 04:50.703
[crowd cheering]

04:53.570 --> 04:56.169
Hey, don't shake me off.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.037
I don't wanna a change-up
when somebody's stealing.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.535
I barely got him.

04:59.537 --> 05:01.469
How'd you know
where he was goin'?

05:01.471 --> 05:02.903
I just knew.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.103
[indistinct chatter]

05:20.070 --> 05:21.136
How you holding up?

05:22.370 --> 05:23.836
What do you mean?

05:23.838 --> 05:25.102
Sooner or later
I'm gonna need your spot

05:25.104 --> 05:26.336
on the roster, Moe.

05:27.571 --> 05:30.302
- Make it later.
- It is later.

05:30.304 --> 05:31.535
I've been asking
for two seasons

05:31.537 --> 05:33.167
to hang up the cleats
and coach.

05:33.169 --> 05:35.068
I like it out there.

05:35.070 --> 05:36.135
<i>You hardly play.</i>

05:36.137 --> 05:38.202
All the more reason
to hang on.

05:38.204 --> 05:41.702
Look, I didn't want to
stop playin' either.

05:41.704 --> 05:43.135
So, what do you say?

05:43.137 --> 05:45.569
Finish out the season,
then coach?

05:45.571 --> 05:47.370
I could go to Detroit.

05:47.372 --> 05:48.768
Mickey'd let me play.

05:48.770 --> 05:50.634
Mickey's an idiot.

05:50.636 --> 05:53.370
So are you,
for letting me play.

05:56.702 --> 05:58.502
You get a call
about the Japan thing?

05:58.504 --> 05:59.601
Yeah.

05:59.603 --> 06:02.202
- <i>You goin'?</i>
- Absolutely.

06:02.204 --> 06:04.668
- Who else is going?
- Uh, we got Murderers' Row.

06:04.670 --> 06:08.134
We got Ruth, Gehrig, Averill,
Gehringer, Gomez.

06:08.136 --> 06:09.535
Am I the only bum?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.102
They like
the Professor Berg thing.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.103
They also like
that you speak Japanese.

06:14.471 --> 06:16.435
Who said I speak Japanese?

06:16.437 --> 06:18.704
<i>Kieran, in one of his columns.</i>

06:19.970 --> 06:21.302
[exhales]

06:21.304 --> 06:23.168
- Interesting.
- Say..

06:23.170 --> 06:24.771
Barker House? Steaks?

06:25.537 --> 06:26.803
No, thanks.

06:28.203 --> 06:29.436
Okay, mystery man.

06:30.803 --> 06:32.236
[shower running]

06:33.337 --> 06:34.936
<i>What you staring at, rookie?</i>

06:36.002 --> 06:38.067
What's the story with Berg?

06:38.069 --> 06:41.569
- What do you mean?
- Uh, he seems strange.

06:41.571 --> 06:42.935
What the hell
are you talking about?

06:42.937 --> 06:44.835
I don't know.
He just seems odd.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.434
Mind you own business, Dalton.

06:46.436 --> 06:48.369
Does he, does he bat lefty?

06:49.436 --> 06:51.037
How the hell should I know?

06:51.868 --> 06:53.267
Why should I care?

06:53.269 --> 06:56.702
It's just I don't feel like
showing my dick to a queer.

06:56.704 --> 06:58.304
Well, don't show it
to him, then.

06:59.936 --> 07:01.368
Somebody ought to find out.

07:06.537 --> 07:08.269
[instrumental music]

07:15.670 --> 07:17.403
<i>You're Moe Berg, aren't you?</i>

07:19.536 --> 07:20.800
Who?

07:20.802 --> 07:24.736
Moe Berg,
the baseball player.

07:24.738 --> 07:26.835
Oh, no. You know,
but I must look like him.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.768
Everybody says
I look like him.

07:28.770 --> 07:30.268
You're kidding.

07:30.270 --> 07:31.599
No, I ain't him.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.334
But I sure as hell
must look like him.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.401
Ha!

07:36.901 --> 07:38.334
Where am I dropping you?

07:38.336 --> 07:39.500
A couple more blocks.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.335
I'll walk from there.
It's fine.

07:41.337 --> 07:42.469
Suit yourself..

07:44.270 --> 07:45.335
...Mr. Berg.

07:47.371 --> 07:50.866
Actually, you know what, stop.
Here. That's good.

07:50.868 --> 07:53.801
[instrumental music]

08:08.335 --> 08:09.869
<i>I wouldn't have
been able to tell.</i>

08:09.871 --> 08:11.400
[chuckles]
Really?

08:11.402 --> 08:13.567
Well, I was on my third
martini by that point, so...

08:13.569 --> 08:14.700
You flatter me.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.466
[laughing]

08:16.468 --> 08:19.667
So, what did you think
of the place, honey?

08:19.669 --> 08:22.402
[music continues]

08:52.303 --> 08:54.236
[glass shatters]

[music continues]

08:59.901 --> 09:01.834
[groaning]

09:04.736 --> 09:06.966
Mr. Dalton,
you live around here?

09:06.968 --> 09:08.567
Man, fuck you!

09:11.235 --> 09:13.700
I didn't catch your answer.
Do you live around here?

09:13.702 --> 09:14.935
[Dalton whimpering]

09:14.937 --> 09:17.866
- Do you live around here?
- No! No.

09:17.868 --> 09:19.867
Do you know what the word
"Hypothetical" means?

09:19.869 --> 09:22.968
No? It means, let's suppose.

09:22.970 --> 09:25.165
<i>Let's suppose there was
a baseball player</i>

09:25.167 --> 09:29.102
a rookie, who intruded on the
privacy of another ballplayer

09:29.104 --> 09:31.799
who was reaching
the twilight of his career

09:31.801 --> 09:33.432
and really had nothing
to lose at this point.

09:33.434 --> 09:34.601
Are you following so far?

09:34.603 --> 09:36.600
You fucking faggot!

09:36.602 --> 09:38.035
[grunting]

09:40.501 --> 09:43.200
[groaning]

09:43.202 --> 09:45.700
You think you know everything,
don't you?

09:45.702 --> 09:47.601
I don't know anything,
alright?

09:48.701 --> 09:49.967
I..

09:50.802 --> 09:52.402
[grunting]

09:53.969 --> 09:56.900
Now, you'll be pleased
to know Cronin..

09:58.668 --> 10:02.000
Cronin is considering
putting you in the lineup.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.568
Show some improvement
and you got a shot.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.199
Good luck.

10:11.934 --> 10:14.068
[panting]

10:21.835 --> 10:23.567

[music continues]

11:06.434 --> 11:09.365
[music continues]

11:18.935 --> 11:20.467
Don't stop.

11:20.469 --> 11:22.098
That's beautiful.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.499
You're a liar.
And you're late.

11:26.768 --> 11:28.534
I had some people to see.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.066
Play.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.601
[music continues]

12:15.102 --> 12:18.034

[giggles]

12:44.800 --> 12:46.065
[chuckles]

12:48.367 --> 12:50.467
Where did that come from?

12:51.601 --> 12:54.666
The way you looked at me
when I came in.

12:54.668 --> 12:57.600
Any normal man would've
done the same thing.

12:59.201 --> 13:00.866
I didn't look at you.

13:01.899 --> 13:03.667
I had my back turned.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.099
And the reason
that I love you

13:07.101 --> 13:09.530
is that you're the farthest
thing from a normal man

13:09.532 --> 13:11.300
that anyone would
ever think of.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.566
[no audio]

13:15.565 --> 13:18.630
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for..

13:18.632 --> 13:20.733
The Information Game!

13:22.033 --> 13:24.165
Yes, the show
where the elite meet

13:25.198 --> 13:27.163
to mete out the meat
of their minds.

13:27.165 --> 13:29.532
Tonight, our special guest
is Moe Berg

13:29.534 --> 13:31.997
catcher for the Boston
Red Sox, and for those of you

13:31.999 --> 13:33.565
who actually read
John Kieran's articles

13:33.567 --> 13:35.598
will know him
as Professor Berg

13:35.600 --> 13:37.831
top graduate
from Princeton University

13:37.833 --> 13:40.765
also holding advanced degrees
from Columbia University

13:40.767 --> 13:43.598
and the Sorbonne University
in Paris, France.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.765
Welcome, Professor Berg.

13:45.767 --> 13:46.931
Thank you.

13:46.933 --> 13:48.532
[audience applauding]

13:49.466 --> 13:50.564
<i>Moe will do.</i>

13:50.566 --> 13:52.265
- Happy to be here.
- Well, Moe it is.

13:52.267 --> 13:55.164
And, Moe, let's play ball.
Our first question is for you.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.300
[piano music]

14:01.499 --> 14:03.064
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.797
Very well done.

14:04.799 --> 14:07.764
And I'll see you next week.

14:07.766 --> 14:09.630
- Thank you.
- Bye.

14:09.632 --> 14:10.698
Bye-bye.

14:12.798 --> 14:14.797
<i>Trick question? Me?</i>

14:14.799 --> 14:17.598
[audience laughing]

14:17.600 --> 14:20.198
<i>The Canary Islands
aren't named for a canary.</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:22.731
The name is derived
from the Latin word <i>canis</i>

14:22.733 --> 14:24.598
which means dog.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.398
<i>The islands were named
for the wild dogs</i>

14:26.400 --> 14:27.862
<i>that are found there.</i>

14:27.864 --> 14:28.863
Right you are.

14:28.865 --> 14:31.897
Well, so far, Moe Berg
is batting a thousand!

14:31.899 --> 14:34.231
[audience applauding]

14:34.233 --> 14:35.663
[gong clangs]

14:35.665 --> 14:38.898
So, Moe, tell us a little bit
about yourself.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.764
Is there a Mrs. Berg?

14:40.766 --> 14:43.630
<i>Ah, yes, she's married
to my father.</i>

14:43.632 --> 14:45.297
[audience laughing]

14:45.299 --> 14:48.797
<i>I meant is there
a Mrs. Berg in your life?</i>

14:48.799 --> 14:50.297
<i>Does this count for points?</i>

14:50.299 --> 14:52.464
[audience laughing]

14:52.466 --> 14:55.431
<i>Wow, you sure wriggled
your way out of that one.</i>

14:55.433 --> 14:57.466
<i>Moe Berg, the walking enigma.</i>

14:58.133 --> 14:59.363
<i>That is..</i>

14:59.365 --> 15:00.732
<i>Well, that's the case</i>

15:00.734 --> 15:01.795
<i>with old Whitby.</i>

15:01.797 --> 15:04.064
- <i>Very similar.</i>
- <i>Was it always?</i>

15:04.066 --> 15:05.298
<i>Always. Because of that,
people...</i>

15:05.300 --> 15:07.295
How do you know
all of these things?

15:07.297 --> 15:09.664
Well, it's common knowledge.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.030
Well..

15:11.032 --> 15:13.865
Oh, I'm going to Japan.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.130
An exhibition tour
after the season.

15:18.132 --> 15:21.364
Oh, Moe, I have always
wanted to see Japan.

15:21.366 --> 15:23.032
I'll take some pictures.

15:23.034 --> 15:26.596
Or you could take me, and I'll
take the pictures myself.

15:26.598 --> 15:29.763
- Oh, Estella, come on.
- I'd really like to go, Moe.

15:29.765 --> 15:33.330
It's just a series
of exhibition games.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.396
And I'm sure the other players
are taking their wives.

15:35.398 --> 15:37.498
You're not my wife.

15:43.432 --> 15:44.530
Mm.

15:44.532 --> 15:45.665
I didn't mean
anything by that.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.363
I was simply stating it
as a fact.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.429
It was more than that, Moe.

15:49.431 --> 15:50.896
It wasn't more than anything.

15:50.898 --> 15:52.898
- <i>Estella.</i>
- What?

15:54.599 --> 15:56.665
Why do you not want
to take me to Japan, Morris?

16:01.531 --> 16:03.897
I would just rather go alone.

16:07.765 --> 16:10.400
Well, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

16:23.864 --> 16:25.497
<i>Tokyo is host of Babe Ruth</i>

16:25.499 --> 16:27.929
<i>and his barnstorming
American baseball team</i>

16:27.931 --> 16:30.664

33:20.155 --> 33:21.520
Hi, nice to meet you.

33:21.522 --> 33:23.587
This is Professor
Sam Goudsmit.

33:23.589 --> 33:24.854
[speaking in foreign language]

33:24.856 --> 33:27.020
If you would.

33:27.022 --> 33:29.954
Bob, Moe, Sam.

33:40.056 --> 33:41.956
We have something for you.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.986
Since this war began..

33:45.988 --> 33:48.954
...we've been engaged
in a massive research

33:48.956 --> 33:51.888
and development program,
called the Manhattan Project.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.286
The purpose of which

33:54.288 --> 33:56.454
is the creation
of a fission bomb.

33:57.657 --> 33:59.786
Now, if initial calculations
are correct

33:59.788 --> 34:03.120
one bomb would be enough
to wipe out an entire city.

34:03.122 --> 34:06.521
The war could be decided
in a day.

34:06.523 --> 34:07.954
We have reason to believe

34:07.956 --> 34:10.389
the Germans are also working
on such a bomb.

34:11.521 --> 34:12.388
Sam.

34:12.389 --> 34:13.887
The scientist leading

34:13.889 --> 34:16.353
the atomic fission program

34:16.356 --> 34:17.920
is Werner Heisenberg.

34:19.989 --> 34:23.954
So, we must get to him

34:23.956 --> 34:26.022
and find out how close
the Germans are to a bomb.

34:27.955 --> 34:30.585
Now, he has left Berlin.

34:30.588 --> 34:33.089
And we don't know where
he is or what he is doing.

34:33.091 --> 34:35.054
But, uh, he has remained
in contact

34:35.056 --> 34:36.619
with an Italian physicist

34:36.621 --> 34:40.320
with whom I worked,
uh, Eduardo Amaldi.

34:40.322 --> 34:43.054
So we'd start in Italy,
the three of us.

34:44.389 --> 34:47.319
Sam for the physics,
me, military

34:47.321 --> 34:49.054
and you, OSS.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.420
- Where in Italy?
- Rome.

34:53.422 --> 34:55.088
Our fifth army is
moving north.

34:55.090 --> 34:58.453
They should take the city
in a week or two.

34:58.455 --> 35:01.518
We'll go in, find the
physicist and interrogate him.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.953
Uh, interview him, please.

35:04.955 --> 35:06.053
Amaldi is my friend.

35:06.055 --> 35:09.220
Uh, if the Italian physicist
has any value

35:09.222 --> 35:12.222
won't the Germans take him when
they pull out, or kill him?

35:12.224 --> 35:15.121
Well, that's why we'd actually
go in with the Fifth Army

35:15.123 --> 35:16.554
to prevent that from
happening.

35:19.489 --> 35:21.054
It's not desk work.

35:21.056 --> 35:22.154
No, it's not.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.519
Could be fun.

35:25.521 --> 35:28.787
Ah, an athlete's
uncomplicated hubris.

35:30.487 --> 35:33.320
I do not speak of fun,

39:19.822 --> 39:21.620
Tell me about Heisenberg.

39:24.219 --> 39:26.152
Well, he's a somewhat
complicated man.

39:27.821 --> 39:29.184
Yeah, just before
the war started

39:29.186 --> 39:30.785
uh, we were together
at the conference

39:30.787 --> 39:32.720
at the University of Michigan.

39:33.687 --> 39:36.319
And Furman and I begged him

39:36.321 --> 39:38.217
not to go back to Germany.

39:38.219 --> 39:39.184
- But he went.
- Yeah.

39:39.186 --> 39:42.085
But to save German science
from the Nazis.

39:43.453 --> 39:46.350
And now he's the head
of the atomic bomb program.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.149
Could he build a bomb?

39:49.151 --> 39:51.885
Could he or would he?

39:52.886 --> 39:54.284
Both.

39:54.286 --> 39:55.684
The could of it would require

39:55.686 --> 39:58.418
enormous physical
and financial resources

39:58.420 --> 40:01.650
perhaps more than Germany
has at its disposal.

40:01.652 --> 40:04.917
But with the resources,
he could do it.

40:06.319 --> 40:07.752
Yes.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.851
And the would of it?

40:12.552 --> 40:13.984
I don't know.

40:15.052 --> 40:16.286
I don't know.

40:22.719 --> 40:24.652
So you were friends?

40:24.654 --> 40:26.084
You knew him well?

40:27.619 --> 40:28.818
Yeah.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.153
Do you still
consider him a friend?

40:34.051 --> 40:36.852
You are a Jew, yeah, Mr. Berg?

40:38.620 --> 40:39.853
Jewish.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.984
A... after the Nazis
occupied Holland

40:43.986 --> 40:46.350
my parents were taken
to Auschwitz.

40:46.352 --> 40:50.117
Now, I contacted Heisenberg
and I asked him

40:50.119 --> 40:53.719
I... begged him
to do what he could.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.885
And we haven't spoken since.

40:59.653 --> 41:01.986

49:43.282 --> 49:44.713
You're good, come on.

49:47.081 --> 49:48.681
Hold position!

49:51.815 --> 49:54.511
It looks like we've got
the city up past the Vatican.

49:54.513 --> 49:57.044
The Germans have pulled back
their rearguard.

49:57.046 --> 49:59.780

50:10.513 --> 50:12.312

they're still building

52:16.480 --> 52:19.711

instead of shaped housings.

52:19.713 --> 52:22.245

52:22.247 --> 52:23.745
This letter,
he asks Amaldi for help

52:23.747 --> 52:25.744

52:25.746 --> 52:27.179
Here, he says
he's doing

52:27.181 --> 52:29.844
large-structure analysis.

52:29.846 --> 52:32.713
Everything points to a reactor
instead of a bomb.

52:32.715 --> 52:35.410
How do we know
these documents aren't decoys?

52:35.412 --> 52:37.111

52:37.113 --> 52:39.346
Uh, they're letters.

52:39.348 --> 52:42.077

These men are friends.

52:42.079 --> 52:45.679
The physics is, uh,
intertwined with the intimacy.

52:45.681 --> 52:48.746
Hmm, we have to be sure.

52:48.748 --> 52:51.578
Then have the British review it.
They are physicists.

52:51.580 --> 52:53.143
They will confirm what I say.

52:53.145 --> 52:54.877
Alright.

52:54.879 --> 52:57.343
We'll have
the Brits weigh in.

52:57.345 --> 52:59.010

- Mr. Berg.
- Hello, sir.

53:23.045 --> 53:24.712
- How's it been going?
- Going well. Yes, sir.

53:24.714 --> 53:26.846
[indistinct chatter]

53:30.747 --> 53:32.745
And the industrial complex
at Hechingen

53:32.747 --> 53:34.678
has only a containment vessel

53:34.680 --> 53:36.011
and a cycle stack

53:36.013 --> 53:38.610
both signs of a nascent
reactor facility.

53:38.612 --> 53:41.179
And the uranium
separation facility?

53:41.181 --> 53:42.576
Consensus in London is

53:42.578 --> 53:44.712
that's just a carbon separator
of some sort.

53:44.714 --> 53:46.377
An attempt at shale
extraction.

53:46.379 --> 53:48.142
- <i>Coal?</i>
- Apparently so.

53:48.144 --> 53:49.678
I concur.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.645
So, where does this leave us?

53:51.647 --> 53:53.345
London is certain.

53:53.347 --> 53:54.976
No German bomb.

53:54.978 --> 53:57.811
<i>Degree of certainty?</i>

53:57.813 --> 53:59.943
There's no such thing
as a degree of certainty.

53:59.945 --> 54:03.210
I mean, something is
either certain or it is not.

54:03.212 --> 54:04.611
<i>Hmm.</i>

54:04.613 --> 54:07.277
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

54:07.279 --> 54:09.711
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

54:15.146 --> 54:17.676
[door opens]

54:17.678 --> 54:19.044
So, what are the alternatives?

54:21.080 --> 54:23.513
Bombing Hechingen
is unlikely to be effective.

54:24.845 --> 54:26.945
If they are developing a bomb

54:26.947 --> 54:29.044
the work, the materials
will be spread out

54:29.046 --> 54:31.077
at facilities
and other factories.

54:31.079 --> 54:34.777
So our British allies
tell us 100% no German bomb.

54:34.779 --> 54:36.877
My people tell me
a 20% possibility.

54:36.879 --> 54:38.875
More likely ten or
five percent.

54:38.877 --> 54:40.677
- Perhaps less.
- <i>But not zero.</i>

54:40.679 --> 54:42.843
It's Probability 101.

54:42.845 --> 54:45.743
You multiply the likelihood of
the event by the consequence.

54:45.745 --> 54:46.812
Five percent chance you're

54:46.814 --> 54:48.444
going to stub your toe in the
dark

54:48.446 --> 54:49.844
you take the chance,
walk to the bathroom

54:49.846 --> 54:51.943
without turning on the lights
and waking your wife.

54:51.945 --> 54:55.775
A five percent chance of losingthe
war to a weapon like this

54:55.777 --> 54:58.542
you do what has to be done.

54:58.544 --> 55:00.845
Which is?

55:00.847 --> 55:02.979
We kill Heisenberg.

55:07.645 --> 55:09.578
What if he's on our side?

55:11.246 --> 55:14.877
Why is it that the Germans
haven't developed a bomb?

55:14.879 --> 55:16.310
Heisenberg has a team of
at least

55:16.312 --> 55:18.542
a dozen capable physicists.

55:18.544 --> 55:19.910
What have they been doing?

55:19.912 --> 55:22.843
What are you saying?
He's dragging his feet?

55:22.845 --> 55:24.543
Intentionally slowing
the program?

55:24.545 --> 55:26.545
I do not think
that Werner Heisenberg

55:26.547 --> 55:29.475
would want to be remembered
as a traitor.

55:29.477 --> 55:31.477
The man who lost the war
for Germany?

55:31.479 --> 55:33.109
We are not absolutely
sure of that

55:33.111 --> 55:34.777
nor do we have
any actual evidence

55:34.779 --> 55:36.076
that he's secretly
working for us.

55:36.078 --> 55:38.177
There are millions of lives
at stake.

55:38.179 --> 55:39.677

Paul Scherrer.

He and Heisenberg
are good friends.

- They play chess by mail.
- He's anti-Nazi.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.840
Exactly, but he and Heisenberg
are still close.

01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:16.739
And he gonna help us
lure Heisenberg to Zurich?

01:00:16.741 --> 01:00:19.408
Such a word, "Lure."

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:23.040
Heisenberg has been there
twice since the war started.

01:00:23.042 --> 01:00:26.807
We simply have Scherrer invite
him to deliver a lecture.

01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:28.708
Can Scherrer be persuaded
to work with us?

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:31.376
Yes. Scherrer will arrange it.

to kill Heisenberg.

- Mr. Aziz, please come in.

01:05:53.607 --> 01:05:54.739
Thank you.

01:05:58.573 --> 01:06:00.836
My name's Berg.

01:06:00.838 --> 01:06:03.937
Oh, so who is Mr. Aziz?

01:06:03.939 --> 01:06:05.305
A cover name.

01:06:05.307 --> 01:06:07.338
I prefer you and I
tell each other the truth.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.471
I'm Morris Berg.

01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:11.237
Oh.

01:06:11.239 --> 01:06:14.538
Sam Goudsmit
sends his regards.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.505
Ah, well.

01:06:15.507 --> 01:06:18.804
I was hoping
he would come here personally.

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.805
Please, please sit down.

01:06:21.807 --> 01:06:24.971
Well, he, uh..

01:06:24.973 --> 01:06:26.572
He sent you something.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.739
Heavy water.

01:06:35.205 --> 01:06:37.338
Nordstemmen impurity.

01:06:41.306 --> 01:06:44.472
Oh, thank you so much.

01:06:44.474 --> 01:06:46.470
No, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.

01:06:46.472 --> 01:06:48.370
Thank you so much.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.904
You don't worry
I give this to the Germans?

01:06:52.038 --> 01:06:54.339
We trust you, professor.

01:06:57.371 --> 01:06:59.304
I may be mistaken, but..

01:07:01.173 --> 01:07:02.769
I don't think
Professor Heisenberg

01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:06.203
will reveal anything
in his lecture.

01:07:06.205 --> 01:07:08.337
Hmm.

01:07:08.339 --> 01:07:11.837
Well, then perhaps I could
speak with him privately.

01:07:13.006 --> 01:07:14.970
Are you hoping he'll defect?

01:07:14.972 --> 01:07:17.171
Yes, I am.

01:07:17.173 --> 01:07:19.303
[laughs]

01:07:19.305 --> 01:07:20.770
Good luck.

01:09:10.006 --> 01:09:11.835
Got to listen carefully.

01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:13.368
There may be one moment
that tells you

01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:16.437
whether the Germans have a
chance at a fission bomb or not.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:20.069
One moment, and you'll learn
all you need to know.

01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:21.870
You understand me, catcher?

01:09:23.537 --> 01:09:24.737
I understand you.

<i>In that moment,
without hesitation</i>

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.801
you will shoot Heisenberg
dead on the spot.

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:19.170
Did he accept
your dinner invitation?

01:10:19.172 --> 01:10:21.870
I prevailed upon our
friendship. He'll be there.

01:10:21.872 --> 01:10:23.236
Good.

01:10:23.238 --> 01:10:26.201
What if he doesn't tell you
what you want to know?

01:10:26.203 --> 01:10:28.636
I'll do my best
to be persuasive.

01:10:28.638 --> 01:10:31.735
There's always a possibility
that you will learn nothing.

01:10:31.737 --> 01:10:33.868
But at least
we will have tried.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.135
Mr. Berg..

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.934
Is there something
you're not telling me?

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:42.535
No.

01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:45.104
Do you plan to kill
Professor Heisenberg?

01:10:46.672 --> 01:10:50.170
I have no intention
whatsoever.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:51.804
One last thing.

01:11:00.403 --> 01:11:04.169
Heisenberg will have undercover
Gestapo agents watching him

01:11:04.171 --> 01:11:06.738
and you can't allow yourself
to be captured.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:18.536
I don't know what God
you believe in, Berg, if any.

01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:23.570
But I'll be asking mine
to keep an eye on you.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.835
Uh, I can't say.

01:14:02.803 --> 01:14:04.535
And I don't have much time.

01:14:05.969 --> 01:14:08.235
But I wanted to call and..

01:14:11.436 --> 01:14:13.435
I wanted to hear your voice.

I'm here, Moe.

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:34.002
I have to go.

I saw him at the lecture.
What's he doing here?

01:17:16.967 --> 01:17:19.299
Yeah,
he's a good friend of mine.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.130
I think you'll find him
very engaging.

01:17:22.132 --> 01:17:24.499
You know he carries a gun.

01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:26.701
Yeah.
No need to worry.

Oh, please, no politics.

01:17:55.435 --> 01:17:56.532
No war.

01:17:56.534 --> 01:17:59.066
There is a war,
whether you like it or not.

01:17:59.068 --> 01:18:01.330
What are you suggesting?
I like the war?

01:18:01.332 --> 01:18:04.031
I am suggesting that unlike
many of your colleagues

01:18:04.033 --> 01:18:07.130
you elected to stay
in Nazi Germany.

01:18:07.132 --> 01:18:11.432
I elected to stay in Germany,
which happens to be Nazi.

01:18:11.434 --> 01:18:14.732
Do I hear politics
from that end of the table?

01:18:14.734 --> 01:18:17.032
One hears what one
wishes to hear.

Please, we are all friends.

There is no avoiding
political matters.

01:19:37.998 --> 01:19:39.398
We can try.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.698
Is that what you've been doing

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.363

the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute

01:19:43.365 --> 01:19:45.130

Please,
I'm not a military man.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.097
We don't know
what sort of man you are.

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:04.597
Yes, we do.

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.596
He's the kind of man
who is helping the Nazis

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:07.898
fight their war.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.665
Building Hitler's super

He doesn't even deny it.

<i>I feel the war
will be over soon.</i>

01:20:20.033 --> 01:20:21.497
<i>Maybe.</i>

Please, please, please.

01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:32.396
Professor Heisenberg
is my guest.

01:20:32.398 --> 01:20:35.931
Well, then the two of you can
lament Germany's loss together.

01:20:35.933 --> 01:20:37.232
Ugh!

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.463

Yes, of course.

01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:38.833
Should I run, perhaps?

01:22:41.198 --> 01:22:42.697
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:22:51.398 --> 01:22:53.531
We must finish our game.

01:22:56.197 --> 01:22:58.831

And so,
in three exchanges

01:23:13.164 --> 01:23:14.896
only my king will survive.

01:23:18.699 --> 01:23:21.196
It seems to me

01:23:21.198 --> 01:23:22.931
this game is nearly over.

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:28.395
I cannot mount an attack
with my king.

01:23:28.397 --> 01:23:30.296

A student of what?

01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:15.329
Of you.

01:24:18.231 --> 01:24:19.530
I see.

01:24:25.698 --> 01:24:28.295
Now, how are we supposed to
ascertain the truth here

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.094
Mr. Berg?

01:24:30.096 --> 01:24:31.894
Will Germany lose the war?

01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:35.396
Is this really a secret?

01:24:37.963 --> 01:24:39.729
I'll ask him myself.

01:24:40.764 --> 01:24:42.998
I think you mean,
am I a traitor?

01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:46.562
Is that what you wish to know?

01:24:46.564 --> 01:24:48.696
And if I think he's lying..

01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:52.397
...then I'll kill him.

01:24:55.396 --> 01:24:57.129

01:24:58.562 --> 01:25:00.762
