WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.366
Right now, we are inventing

00:04.471 --> 00:06.042
all these different technologies,

00:06.107 --> 00:08.567
with which we could
actually make ourselves

00:08.642 --> 00:10.882
superhumans with super intelligence.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.578
The potentials are quite extreme.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.417
You could eventually
have printable noses,

00:16.517 --> 00:18.347
ears, lungs, kidneys.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.752
The big question is immortality.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.322
Dying, is it something we have to do?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.329
I'm convinced that the engineers at MIT

00:28.429 --> 00:31.499
are looking back into the
ancient examples of the gods.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.197
You've got to wonder,

00:34.268 --> 00:37.498
are extraterrestrials
somehow guiding us,

00:37.605 --> 00:38.835
and manipulating us

00:38.906 --> 00:41.766
into this new future, and this new human

00:41.876 --> 00:44.476
that we are destined to be?

00:44.545 --> 00:47.445
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:47.548 --> 00:51.748
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:51.819 --> 00:53.849
and other visitors from the stars.

00:53.954 --> 00:57.494
What if it were true?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.561
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:59.627 --> 01:03.257
really help to shape our history?

01:03.364 --> 01:07.074
And if so, might their ultimate
plan be revealed...

01:07.168 --> 01:11.368
with the rise of the Next Humans?

# Ancient Aliens 11x03 #
The Next Humans
Original Air Date on May 20, 2016

01:43.604 --> 01:46.174
Mountain View, California.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.370
August, 1962.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.537
At NASA's Ames Research Center,

01:52.613 --> 01:56.823
the newly formed Division of
Biotechnology and Human Research

01:56.884 --> 02:00.994
begins a study on the
possibility of exploring space

02:01.055 --> 02:04.185
with technologically-enhanced humans,

02:04.291 --> 02:07.131
otherwise known as cyborgs.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.758
Ten months later, they release a report

02:10.865 --> 02:15.295
called "The Cyborg Study:
Engineering Man for Space."

02:15.402 --> 02:19.342
In it, they propose that
astronauts will require

02:19.406 --> 02:21.706
artificial organs and pharmaceuticals

02:21.775 --> 02:25.505
to survive in the harshest
environments of deep space...

02:26.881 --> 02:29.681
...as we explore
beyond our solar system.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.549
While the program was quickly abandoned

02:34.655 --> 02:37.355
due to the lack of available technology,

02:37.458 --> 02:41.858
it helped usher in a new era
of scientific research focused

02:41.962 --> 02:46.632
on augmenting the human species
into a new stage of evolution:

02:46.667 --> 02:49.297
the Transhuman.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.665
Transhumanism is the use

02:52.773 --> 02:55.643
of technology by humans,

02:55.743 --> 02:59.113
to enhance the physical, psychological,

02:59.213 --> 03:02.113
and most of all,
intellectual capabilities.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.545
We transhumanists want to use
science and technology

03:08.656 --> 03:11.386
to self-direct our evolution.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.432
There are lots of transhumanists now

03:13.494 --> 03:15.634
that don't even consider
themselves transhuman--

03:15.729 --> 03:17.259
for example, people who have pacemakers,

03:17.364 --> 03:21.004
or cochlear implants,
or hip replacements.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.401
These are technologies that we're using,

03:23.470 --> 03:25.440
and that is beyond human.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.341
The idea of their being a transhuman

03:29.443 --> 03:32.083
is actually a very old notion,

03:32.179 --> 03:35.249
and it stems from our longing
for immortality.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.349
so there were attempts
to extend human life.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.520
Transhumanism has been
thought of for a very long time,

03:42.623 --> 03:43.663
throughout mythology.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.590
From Gilgamesh's search for immortality,

03:48.662 --> 03:50.932
to alchemy...

03:53.167 --> 03:55.527
...to the search
for the fountain of life.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.496
Really, the quest to overcome
what it means to be human,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.337
to see if we can live forever,

04:01.442 --> 04:03.442
that has been the quest
for a very long time.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.052
Although the notion of modifying

04:07.114 --> 04:08.614
the body with technology

04:08.716 --> 04:11.976
has been around for thousands of years,

04:12.086 --> 04:15.346
transhumanists say the 21st century

04:15.456 --> 04:18.916
will radically change
what it means to be a human...

04:20.560 --> 04:23.401
...when we begin to genetically engineer

04:23.464 --> 04:26.904
an entirely new generation of humans.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.166
April 22, 2015.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.337
Guangzhou, China.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.281
Geneticists
at the Sun Yat-Sen University

04:43.350 --> 04:46.320
make history
as the first team in the world

04:46.420 --> 04:48.790
to genetically modify a human embryo.

04:50.357 --> 04:54.927
Using a gene editing technique
known as CRISPR-Cas9,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.795
the scientists were able
to correct the gene defect

04:57.898 --> 05:02.128
that causes beta-thalassemia,
a blood disease,

05:02.236 --> 05:05.436
by snipping out and replacing
portions of the DNA

05:05.539 --> 05:07.539
in the fertilized egg.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.153
By using a new technology called CRISPR,

05:14.248 --> 05:16.748
scientists are able to actually
cut into the DNA

05:16.817 --> 05:20.217
and replace parts of the DNA

05:20.321 --> 05:23.291
with genetically-modified proteins.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.887
This allows us to literally
transform who we are.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.333
When we look at DNA changing,

05:31.432 --> 05:35.072
it can be used
not just to overcome problems,

05:35.135 --> 05:39.335
but to improve your looks, maybe
change the color or your hair,

05:39.406 --> 05:41.036
or your eyes, or perhaps

05:41.141 --> 05:43.441
even more importantly,
change your intellectual

05:43.510 --> 05:45.680
or physical abilities.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.380
Will the modification of human embryos

05:52.419 --> 05:54.189
soon lead to a wave

05:54.254 --> 05:57.394
of what futurists call
"designer babies,"

05:57.491 --> 06:00.361
children whose physical features

06:00.427 --> 06:01.857
and mental capabilities

06:01.962 --> 06:03.702
were selected by their parents.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.902
Many believe that not only
is this a possibility,

06:08.969 --> 06:10.239
but that the very definition

06:10.304 --> 06:13.414
of a parent may soon change as well.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.067
The UK is on its way to becoming
the first country

06:16.143 --> 06:18.013
to legalize the creation of babies

06:18.112 --> 06:19.782
from three different people.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.580
And a large majority
of the House of Commons

06:21.648 --> 06:23.248
voted in favor of the controversial

06:23.317 --> 06:26.917
"Three Parent In Vitro
Fertilization," or TPIVF.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.490
The British government
officially declared it legal,

06:30.591 --> 06:33.431
so actual children have been born

06:33.494 --> 06:37.934
that have DNA
from three different parents.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.471
I think it is quite possible,
in the future,

06:41.568 --> 06:43.538
that it won't be just two

06:43.604 --> 06:46.444
or three parents that the child has,

06:46.507 --> 06:49.777
but could be any number.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.307
That sounds like science fiction,

06:51.412 --> 06:52.882
but it's actually something
the Japanese scientists

06:52.946 --> 06:54.046
are working on right now.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.518
And what that would entail

06:56.583 --> 06:58.323
is using an artificial womb.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.523
Actually gestating the child

07:00.587 --> 07:02.147
within that artificial womb.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.892
Now, you can imagine,
if we can get to this stage,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.088
it doesn't matter
who... who the parents are.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.464
You could have a community
of people with the best genes

07:10.564 --> 07:12.434
contributing to making that child.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.299
And that is really the future
that is in front of us.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.935
Is it possible

07:20.007 --> 07:22.207
we could synthetically create
human beings,

07:22.309 --> 07:24.939
picking and choosing genetic traits

07:25.045 --> 07:27.805
from any number of donors?

07:27.915 --> 07:31.045
Could the characteristics of a person

07:31.118 --> 07:35.018
soon be limited only
by our imaginations?

07:35.122 --> 07:38.392
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

07:38.492 --> 07:42.332
and suggest an even more
incredible possibility:

07:42.396 --> 07:45.296
that we are not the first to do this.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.639
Luxor, Egypt.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.941
Here in the Deir el-Bahari
mortuary temple

07:59.012 --> 08:01.612
lies the burial chamber of Hatshepsut,

08:01.715 --> 08:06.245
one of the only queens
to ever become a pharaoh.

08:06.353 --> 08:10.363
And on the frescoed walls
of this tomb is a scene

08:10.457 --> 08:12.517
portraying Hatshepsut's conception

08:12.626 --> 08:14.986
at the hands of divine beings.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.396
On the walls of Queen
Hatshepsut's mortuary temple,

08:22.469 --> 08:26.639
it says... that... a long time ago...

08:28.342 --> 08:31.382
...God Amon came to Hatshepsut's mother,

08:31.478 --> 08:33.378
Ahmose, in her sleep,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.850
and with the power of God Anum,

08:35.916 --> 08:38.046
and with the key of ankh in his hand,

08:38.150 --> 08:40.650
he created baby Hatshepsut.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.087
He uses the ankh...

08:47.427 --> 08:49.587
...that key-shaped tool,

08:49.696 --> 08:52.996
to give life, to create a human.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.069
Any device that can give life

08:58.171 --> 09:02.271
upon something would have
to appear as magical...

09:03.844 --> 09:06.444
...so you have to wonder
who were these gods

09:06.547 --> 09:08.647
that they were talking about?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.115
What we have in this story

09:10.183 --> 09:13.083
is actually the immaculate conception of

09:13.186 --> 09:16.816
Hatshepsut, and it is clear
that this is the story

09:16.890 --> 09:20.060
of an extraterrestrial
intervention in the creation

09:20.160 --> 09:22.490
of a star child, Hatshepsut.

09:22.596 --> 09:26.156
So, we appear to be dealing
with some sort of a technology,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.096
a DNA-based technology

09:28.168 --> 09:32.068
that can manifest human
bodies or alter human DNA.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.583
Could Hatshepsut have
been genetically engineered

09:39.680 --> 09:42.180
by otherworldly beings?

09:43.784 --> 09:47.554
And is it possible that
humans are just now starting

09:47.621 --> 09:50.961
to unlock the incredible
potential hidden within us

09:51.058 --> 09:54.088
by our extraterrestrial creators,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.861
as ancient astronaut theorists propose?

09:59.333 --> 10:03.203
Perhaps further clues can
be found in our own attempts,

10:03.236 --> 10:07.166
not in creating life,
but in reversing death.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.707
State College, Pennsylvania.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.716
October 15, 2015.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.390
Dr. Gong Chen and a team of biologists

10:23.490 --> 10:25.160
from the Life Sciences Department

10:25.259 --> 10:27.229
at Penn State University

10:27.328 --> 10:31.158
reveal research on
a cocktail of specialized drugs

10:31.265 --> 10:34.925
designed to convert
non-neuronal cells in the brain,

10:35.035 --> 10:37.965
called glial cells, into neurons.

10:41.275 --> 10:44.905
90% of our brain is made up
of what's called glial cells.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.853
These cells are just a support mechanism

10:48.949 --> 10:50.779
for the neurons themselves.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.024
What we can do at the moment

10:54.121 --> 10:57.961
is to take glial cells from the brain

10:58.058 --> 11:00.328
and to use different
chemicals, essentially,

11:00.427 --> 11:03.157
to alter the functioning
of the glial cells.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.603
Chemicals will cause them

11:05.699 --> 11:09.599
to become fresh neurons.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.303
Gong Chen's belief
for this research is that

11:12.406 --> 11:14.666
things like severe brain trauma,

11:14.775 --> 11:18.075
Parkinson's disease,
and Alzheimer's could actually

11:18.145 --> 11:21.345
be effectively transformed and healed.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.853
Could degenerative brain disorders

11:27.955 --> 11:29.885
like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

11:29.990 --> 11:33.460
be cured by a simple chemical injection?

11:35.229 --> 11:38.399
And if so, could we eventually
rid the brain

11:38.465 --> 11:40.965
of neurological diseases entirely?

11:43.003 --> 11:46.343
Transhumanists believe
the therapeutic uses

11:46.440 --> 11:48.140
for this incredible discovery

11:48.242 --> 11:51.042
are only a small part
of the bigger picture.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.881
In the future, we could
see using that technology

11:57.985 --> 12:01.445
to increase our intelligence
to a, to a superhuman state.

12:01.555 --> 12:06.155
Now imagine, because the brain
is only ten percent neurons,

12:06.226 --> 12:07.526
imagine if we could

12:07.628 --> 12:11.628
increase the brain's capacity to 35%.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.072
That could change everything.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.238
I mean, we could become
a super intelligent species.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.942
Could you, in fact,
advance the human IQ,

12:23.043 --> 12:24.813
perhaps to such a degree

12:24.912 --> 12:27.082
that you might have
people walking around now

12:27.181 --> 12:29.921
with a 1,000 IQ?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.817
Could Dr. Chen's research

12:31.919 --> 12:36.289
lead us to an exponential
increase of the human intellect?

12:36.390 --> 12:39.960
And if so, will we seem like primates

12:40.060 --> 12:42.460
to the people of tomorrow?

12:42.563 --> 12:47.903
Transhumanists suggest that if
we can create new brain cells,

12:48.001 --> 12:51.301
we could potentially reproduce
all of the body's cells,

12:51.405 --> 12:54.005
which would have profound implications.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.051
The big question is immortality.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.747
Dying, is it something we have to do?

13:03.851 --> 13:08.521
Cells die away, but if we can
start replacing the cells,

13:08.622 --> 13:11.792
and if we can replace brain cells

13:11.892 --> 13:13.992
and keep the functioning
of the brain going,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.034
then it does, potentially,

13:16.130 --> 13:21.070
really extend life, in theory, forever.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.568
Some people, like Ray Kurzweil,

13:22.669 --> 13:26.269
have suggested by 2045
we'll be able to do that.

13:28.442 --> 13:29.912
Ray Kurzweil

13:30.010 --> 13:32.210
is Google's Director of Engineering,

13:32.312 --> 13:36.352
a transhumanist, prolific
author and inventor.

13:36.450 --> 13:39.480
He believes, in the near future,

13:39.586 --> 13:43.016
humans will be able to extend
their lives indefinitely.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.931
To reach that point, he maintains

13:47.027 --> 13:49.387
a daily diet of over 100

13:49.496 --> 13:51.726
different body and mind enhancing pills,

13:51.832 --> 13:54.902
called nootropics.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.372
Nootropics are essentially
drugs of one kind or another,

13:58.472 --> 14:01.972
chemicals if you like,
that can change the way

14:02.075 --> 14:03.635
most of the body functions,

14:03.744 --> 14:06.044
but particularly how
the brain functions.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.575
Choline, for example,

14:09.683 --> 14:12.753
helps with memory, and so,
people are using

14:12.853 --> 14:14.853
these nootropics
to enhance their memory,

14:14.955 --> 14:19.515
to have better recall,
to have better focus.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.126
You're starting to see
nootropics pop up everywhere,

14:21.228 --> 14:22.988
especially in Silicon Valley.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.826
In the future, the idea

14:24.898 --> 14:27.868
of enhancing the cognitive
ability in the human being

14:27.968 --> 14:29.768
is going to be sort of commonplace.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.270
Kurzweil and others predict

14:35.375 --> 14:39.605
nootropics will become a new
multi-billion dollar industry

14:39.713 --> 14:43.113
as people turn to supplements
to enhance their bodies

14:43.217 --> 14:45.477
and prolong their lives.

14:45.586 --> 14:48.846
But ancient astronaut
theorists believe that,

14:48.956 --> 14:50.856
like genetic manipulation,

14:50.924 --> 14:56.294
evidence of nootropic use can
be found thousands of years ago.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.496
Dating back to the fifth century BC,

14:59.600 --> 15:03.130
the Hindu Sanskrit epic
known as The Mahabharata,

15:03.237 --> 15:06.337
tells the story of Samudra Manthana,

15:06.406 --> 15:09.466
a celestial battle between the gods

15:09.576 --> 15:13.376
for a rare substance
that grants immortality.

15:16.750 --> 15:22.420
The "Samudra Manthana" means
the "churning of the ocean."

15:22.522 --> 15:26.092
And in this case,
the ocean is visualized

15:26.193 --> 15:28.263
as a cosmic sea of milk.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.962
It is, in essence, the Milky Way itself.

15:32.065 --> 15:36.095
There were two primary forces
at odds in the universe.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.143
There were the Asuras...

15:38.238 --> 15:39.638
and they were at odds

15:39.740 --> 15:43.580
with a new order of gods-- the Devas.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.709
The gods went to Lord Vishnu
and Vishnu said,

15:48.815 --> 15:51.675
why don't you try
to cooperate with them?

15:51.752 --> 15:54.622
At the very depths of the ocean,

15:54.721 --> 15:57.761
there is a substance called Amrita,

15:57.824 --> 16:00.234
a divine nectar of immortality.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.287
Churn the cosmic ocean of milk,

16:02.396 --> 16:05.656
and it will yield forth
the nectar of immortality,

16:05.766 --> 16:07.526
and you can share it.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.944
The gods and the demons start churning,

16:11.038 --> 16:13.138
in the heavens, the Milky Way,

16:13.240 --> 16:17.180
and what is produced
by this is an elixir,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.507
an elixir that can grant immortality.

16:19.613 --> 16:22.253
Well, there was a terrible war now,

16:22.349 --> 16:25.019
because everyone wanted this.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.018
In order to win the battle for the gods,

16:28.121 --> 16:30.861
they decide they need this amrita,

16:30.957 --> 16:32.887
this elixir of life.

16:32.993 --> 16:37.263
So you have to wonder if this
story isn't about some kind of

16:37.364 --> 16:39.734
extraterrestrial war in heaven,

16:39.833 --> 16:44.473
where aliens are fighting
over nootropics.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.176
Could the story of the Samudra Manthana

16:52.279 --> 16:55.509
be an ancient account
of a celestial battle

16:55.615 --> 16:57.475
over a highly advanced nootropic?

16:59.119 --> 17:02.519
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

17:02.622 --> 17:05.692
and point to legends
of immortality elixirs

17:05.791 --> 17:10.432
throughout antiquity.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.200
The ancients had many stories
of immortality--

17:13.300 --> 17:15.099
that it was touchable or reachable.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.710
The Chinese had
the peaches of immortality.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.777
The Greeks had ambrosia.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.807
The Mesopotamians
had the idea of "soma."

17:27.881 --> 17:32.121
In the Biblical tradition,
there is the tree of life.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.349
There is something that you
can ingest and gain immortality.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.258
This quest has been going on

17:39.359 --> 17:40.929
for thousands of years,

17:41.027 --> 17:44.627
around the world,
by many different cultures.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.031
This quest for these smart drugs,

17:48.135 --> 17:52.035
that will enhance our lifestyle
and our mental clarity.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.039
So you have to wonder,

17:54.141 --> 17:57.841
was this nootropic drug

17:57.944 --> 18:00.954
some kind of extraterrestrial elixir

18:01.047 --> 18:02.877
that was well-known in ancient times?

18:07.421 --> 18:08.891
Could ancient accounts

18:08.989 --> 18:12.689
of elixirs of immortality
really be descriptions

18:12.793 --> 18:16.193
of extraterrestrial nootropics?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.826
And might it soon be possible

18:18.932 --> 18:21.472
to unlock our full human potential

18:21.568 --> 18:24.338
simply with the right potion or pill,

18:24.438 --> 18:27.468
perhaps fulfilling a destiny

18:27.574 --> 18:30.584
to become like our alien ancestors?

18:30.677 --> 18:34.377
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

18:34.481 --> 18:37.081
and suggest molecular chemistry

18:37.184 --> 18:40.324
is only the beginning
of the human upgrade.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.133
Nano-machines could actually

18:49.229 --> 18:50.729
heal the wounds in our bodies.

18:50.831 --> 18:54.831
The possibility
of reversing human aging,

18:54.935 --> 18:56.935
is not a very big stretch.

19:02.926 --> 19:06.486
November 17, 2015.

19:09.532 --> 19:11.132
A team of researchers

19:11.201 --> 19:14.871
from North Carolina State
University, and Rice University,

19:14.938 --> 19:17.708
unveil the first motor-driven,

19:17.807 --> 19:20.107
submersible nanomachines ever created.

19:23.646 --> 19:28.546
Molecular nano-technology is the idea

19:28.651 --> 19:31.891
of building devices, machines,

19:31.988 --> 19:34.058
at a molecular scale.

19:34.124 --> 19:38.994
"Nano" refers to a billionth of a meter,

19:39.095 --> 19:40.455
so, very, very small.

19:40.563 --> 19:42.463
We're getting down to atomic scale.

19:45.201 --> 19:48.841
Measuring only 244 atoms across,

19:48.938 --> 19:51.608
these miniature robots are designed

19:51.708 --> 19:53.268
to deliver specialized medicines

19:53.343 --> 19:56.213
throughout the body,
using the bloodstream.

19:56.279 --> 20:01.049
Scientists have created biobots
that are the first of its kind.

20:01.151 --> 20:04.351
These tiny little bio hybrids
and bots are capable

20:04.454 --> 20:07.324
of tying to viscous material
through our bodies.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.293
They take submersible nanomachines

20:09.359 --> 20:11.059
that can be controlled with UV light,

20:11.161 --> 20:14.061
and using the UV light, they can control

20:14.097 --> 20:16.527
where these nanomachines take nutrients

20:16.633 --> 20:19.003
and take medicines into the body.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.666
As long as we have a way

20:21.738 --> 20:24.038
of controlling them from the outside,

20:24.107 --> 20:26.467
they can move around very, very quickly,

20:26.543 --> 20:29.283
perform a function-- i-if we're looking

20:29.379 --> 20:31.179
at operating on a cancer,

20:31.281 --> 20:33.151
then, potentially, they could do

20:33.249 --> 20:35.779
that operation for you, from within.

20:40.690 --> 20:44.230
This could lead to huge advances

20:44.327 --> 20:47.397
in medicine, in healing,

20:47.497 --> 20:50.997
leading to nanomachines
that could actually

20:51.100 --> 20:52.500
heal the wounds in our bodies,

20:52.602 --> 20:55.802
close things up much faster,

20:55.905 --> 20:59.135
repair damaged tissue,
extend our lifespan,

20:59.242 --> 21:04.552
and literally bring us into
a new level of human evolution.

21:08.418 --> 21:10.178
Transhumanists believe

21:10.253 --> 21:11.993
our bodies will soon be home

21:12.088 --> 21:15.018
to swarms of nanomachines,

21:15.124 --> 21:18.234
that will both heal,
and also warn of disease.

21:20.630 --> 21:22.030
And some propose

21:22.131 --> 21:25.331
this technology is advancing so rapidly

21:25.401 --> 21:26.631
that it will not just be

21:26.703 --> 21:29.043
future generations that will live tens

21:29.138 --> 21:31.968
or even hundreds of years longer,

21:32.075 --> 21:35.035
but people who are alive today.

21:35.144 --> 21:39.754
The possibility
of reversing human aging,

21:39.849 --> 21:42.649
as opposed to just slowing it down,

21:42.752 --> 21:44.692
is not a very big stretch.

21:44.787 --> 21:49.387
So if you understand aging
and the fundamentals

21:49.492 --> 21:52.792
of the processes that are leading to it,

21:52.896 --> 21:55.456
it would be quite possible,
both to slow it,

21:55.531 --> 21:59.071
and it would also be
possible to reverse it.

22:03.773 --> 22:05.643
An example of this is a study

22:05.742 --> 22:06.972
that has gone on at Harvard,

22:07.076 --> 22:10.136
by reversing the muscle tissue in mice.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.778
We have actually reversed
the age in these mice.

22:17.587 --> 22:18.687
And so, if we can do that

22:18.788 --> 22:21.418
in the laboratory setting,

22:21.524 --> 22:23.164
it's only a matter of time

22:23.226 --> 22:26.126
before we're able to reverse
our own aging process.

22:28.231 --> 22:30.501
Could millions of microscopic robots

22:30.600 --> 22:33.700
soon be swimming in our bloodstreams,

22:33.803 --> 22:35.743
augmenting our immune system,

22:35.805 --> 22:39.235
and even reversing the aging
process entirely,

22:39.309 --> 22:41.239
as transhumanists believe?

22:43.146 --> 22:45.376
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

22:45.481 --> 22:48.751
that if such
a transformation does occur,

22:48.851 --> 22:51.191
it may be a sign that we're evolving

22:51.287 --> 22:54.217
to become more like our alien ancestors.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.796
As evidence, they point
to the Sumerian King List,

23:03.866 --> 23:06.126
a series of stone tablets

23:06.235 --> 23:09.665
that are believed to be
over 4,000 years old,

23:09.772 --> 23:11.372
and record the reigns

23:11.474 --> 23:13.514
of ancient Mesopotamian kings

23:13.576 --> 23:17.306
that ruled for upwards of 43,000 years.

23:20.216 --> 23:21.446
The Sumerian Kings List

23:21.484 --> 23:24.554
was handed down to humanity by the gods.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.424
What's extraordinary is that
the reigns of these kings

23:27.490 --> 23:29.690
last into the thousands of years.

23:29.759 --> 23:31.529
These people weren't making allegorical

23:31.627 --> 23:32.857
or metaphorical statements,

23:32.962 --> 23:35.362
these were accurate historical records.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.670
Ancient texts,

23:38.768 --> 23:41.398
including the Bible
and the Sumerian texts,

23:41.471 --> 23:43.471
talk about ancient kings

23:43.573 --> 23:47.613
and other people living
incredibly long life spans.

23:47.710 --> 23:52.750
Methuselah, who was supposedly
the father of Noah,

23:52.849 --> 23:55.649
was said to have lived for 969 years.

23:58.554 --> 24:00.224
When we look into the past,

24:00.289 --> 24:02.219
there's a clear record
of people who have lived

24:02.291 --> 24:05.791
a much longer life span
than what we have today.

24:05.895 --> 24:07.995
We have to wonder if
these beings weren't given

24:08.097 --> 24:10.797
or had access to
some type of nanotechnology.

24:12.568 --> 24:14.098
And it fuels the idea and understanding,

24:14.203 --> 24:17.473
and our drive today,
to be like the gods.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.806
And this important nanotechnology

24:22.912 --> 24:25.852
is something that extraterrestrials

24:25.915 --> 24:29.915
and other advanced civilizations
would already have.

24:31.654 --> 24:33.224
And it would only make sense that,

24:33.289 --> 24:36.559
if extraterrestrials
are coming to our planet,

24:36.659 --> 24:39.829
they would have brought
this nanotechnology with them.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.600
Might our research

24:45.701 --> 24:49.801
into nanotechnology, nootropics
and genetic engineering

24:49.906 --> 24:53.706
ascend us to the level
of extraterrestrials

24:53.810 --> 24:57.010
that came to Earth
thousands of years ago,

24:57.080 --> 25:00.280
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest?

25:02.718 --> 25:05.388
Perhaps further clues can be found

25:05.455 --> 25:08.755
by examining the technology
that is being developed

25:08.825 --> 25:11.885
to upgrade not just our blood,

25:11.994 --> 25:14.964
but even our flesh.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.804
We can use the power of
our thoughts to control

25:20.903 --> 25:22.443
avatar robots.

25:23.906 --> 25:26.106
The engineers at MIT are looking back

25:26.175 --> 25:28.805
into the ancient examples of the gods.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.990
New York City.

25:37.095 --> 25:41.155
May 4, 2015.

25:41.266 --> 25:44.496
At TechCrunch Disrupt New York,

25:44.602 --> 25:47.372
an annual new technologies conference,

25:47.438 --> 25:49.938
U.S. biotech startup BioBots

25:50.008 --> 25:54.078
launches a desktop 3D printer
for biomaterials...

25:55.980 --> 25:59.450
...which they use to print
a replica of Van Gogh's ear.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.592
Instead of plastic,

26:03.688 --> 26:06.318
special ink is combined
with biomaterials--

26:06.424 --> 26:09.294
like collagen and cultured cells--

26:09.360 --> 26:12.800
to build living tissue and human organs.

26:16.634 --> 26:18.904
So, right now,
we're just at the beginning

26:18.970 --> 26:21.140
of understanding how to 3D-print organs.

26:23.441 --> 26:25.211
It's a process called "biofabrication."

26:25.310 --> 26:29.210
So BioBots has created
a biofabrication 3D printer

26:29.314 --> 26:33.054
that can print artificial tissue
and small organs.

26:34.352 --> 26:36.452
In the future, what we're going to see

26:36.521 --> 26:38.121
are 3D printers that are

26:38.223 --> 26:41.523
bio-fabricating our
bodies and our organs.

26:44.295 --> 26:46.895
You could eventually have

26:46.965 --> 26:49.165
printable noses, lungs,

26:49.234 --> 26:52.344
ears, kidneys...

26:52.437 --> 26:55.067
and, in certain ways,

26:55.139 --> 26:57.169
this technology is so extreme

26:57.242 --> 26:59.142
that it could make it democratic.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.014
It could make it inexpensive.

27:01.112 --> 27:05.152
So in the hands of skilled,
trained medical professionals,

27:05.250 --> 27:06.850
it could be possible in the future

27:06.951 --> 27:10.591
to 3D print organs for people

27:10.688 --> 27:13.058
out of their own genetic material.

27:19.063 --> 27:20.933
Transhumanists believe

27:21.032 --> 27:24.502
we may soon transcend
our biological limitations,

27:24.602 --> 27:28.872
as we embed machines
directly into our own bodies.

27:31.109 --> 27:34.909
DARPA, the agency of
the U.S. Department of Defense

27:35.013 --> 27:37.983
responsible for the development
of emerging technologies

27:38.049 --> 27:40.049
for use by the military...

27:40.151 --> 27:44.921
is currently designing neural
implants that will improve

27:45.023 --> 27:49.563
cognitive speed and
memory retention in soldiers.

27:49.661 --> 27:52.031
And in 2014,

27:52.130 --> 27:56.330
scientists at Seoul National
University in South Korea

27:56.401 --> 28:00.101
unveiled research on
synthetic "smart skin"--

28:00.204 --> 28:02.974
lifelike ultra-thin crystalline silicon

28:03.041 --> 28:06.081
designed to cover prosthetic limbs,

28:06.177 --> 28:09.747
giving the user all of the
sensations of a natural limb.

28:12.917 --> 28:16.187
They have now developed a-a skin

28:16.287 --> 28:19.457
which has touch senses embedded in it

28:19.557 --> 28:21.657
with a very fine matrix,

28:21.759 --> 28:25.899
which can be put around a prosthetic.

28:25.997 --> 28:29.167
So you can actually feel

28:29.267 --> 28:30.527
what that arm is feeling

28:30.635 --> 28:32.335
or you can touch the floor,

28:32.403 --> 28:36.543
feel whether it's hot or cold,
or applying pressure.

28:36.641 --> 28:37.941
Future artificial limbs

28:38.042 --> 28:39.882
will look just like our skin,

28:39.944 --> 28:41.584
look just like our hands and our legs.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.509
It's going to affect the entire world.

28:43.614 --> 28:44.954
We're going to see people

28:45.016 --> 28:47.246
using smart prosthetics

28:47.352 --> 28:48.952
that are added to the body,

28:49.020 --> 28:52.690
that can be controlled
directly through the brain.

28:52.757 --> 28:56.857
And that really is
the future of prosthetics.

28:56.928 --> 29:00.358
I can speak from experience,

29:00.465 --> 29:02.095
because I've had one myself--

29:02.200 --> 29:05.700
our implants that link
either into the brain

29:05.803 --> 29:08.373
or into the human nervous system--

29:08.473 --> 29:10.473
and what I had was

29:10.575 --> 29:14.435
100 small electrodes...

29:14.545 --> 29:16.645
fired into my nervous system

29:16.748 --> 29:19.578
to link my nervous system
with a computer.

29:19.650 --> 29:23.390
It was a bit like plugging
a plug into an electric socket,

29:23.454 --> 29:26.494
but the socket was my nervous system.

29:26.557 --> 29:29.327
I went to Columbia University
in New York,

29:29.427 --> 29:32.057
we plugged my nervous system
into the Internet,

29:32.163 --> 29:36.373
and I controlled a robot hand
from my brain signals.

29:36.467 --> 29:38.467
You can extend your nervous system

29:38.569 --> 29:40.439
by simply plugging into it.

29:43.107 --> 29:45.607
If we can use
just the power of our thought

29:45.710 --> 29:49.280
to control artificial limbs...

29:49.380 --> 29:51.180
we can eventually, one day,

29:51.282 --> 29:55.282
use the power of our thoughts
to control avatar robots.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.023
I think we're going to see
that kind of technology

30:01.092 --> 30:03.492
used to control avatars on the Moon;

30:03.594 --> 30:06.034
we're going to see that kind of
technology to control

30:06.097 --> 30:08.457
robotic humanoid avatars on Mars.

30:13.171 --> 30:16.011
Could we one day
venture into the cosmos,

30:16.073 --> 30:18.043
not with our bodies,

30:18.142 --> 30:22.552
but by wirelessly controlling
robotic avatars?

30:22.613 --> 30:27.083
And is it possible
that extraterrestrials

30:27.185 --> 30:29.315
have utilized these same technologies

30:29.420 --> 30:32.220
to explore Earth in the distant past?

30:35.159 --> 30:38.229
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

30:38.329 --> 30:42.299
and point to technologies
currently in development at MIT

30:42.400 --> 30:45.470
that strongly resemble
those in ancient accounts

30:45.536 --> 30:48.496
of gods who descended from the sky.

30:51.075 --> 30:53.775
At the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's

30:53.878 --> 30:56.208
Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies,

30:56.314 --> 31:00.124
they are developing a new
smart skin for our soldiers

31:00.218 --> 31:03.248
that would make them resistant
to ballistic attack

31:03.354 --> 31:06.894
or chemical attack and also
would instantly self-repair.

31:08.426 --> 31:10.526
This is absolutely extraordinary,

31:10.595 --> 31:13.255
because in the ancient texts,
we learn of the gods

31:13.331 --> 31:16.531
who wore a similar skin that
seemed to make them impervious

31:16.601 --> 31:18.501
to any kind of human weaponry.

31:18.603 --> 31:20.703
They couldn't die.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.570
Now when I hear stories

31:24.675 --> 31:27.735
of semi-divine beings, such as Hercules,

31:27.845 --> 31:32.615
with his impenetrable lion skin,

31:32.683 --> 31:35.223
or in the Sanskrit Mahabharata,

31:35.319 --> 31:39.459
the story of Karna
and his impenetrable armor,

31:39.557 --> 31:41.357
I have to ask the question

31:41.425 --> 31:44.855
whether or not these were all
misunderstood technologies.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.099
Could the self-repairing skin

31:51.135 --> 31:53.235
being developed at MIT

31:53.304 --> 31:54.704
be the same technology

31:54.772 --> 31:57.272
our ancestors wrote about

31:57.375 --> 32:00.475
when they described divine
beings that were invincible?

32:02.313 --> 32:05.253
And are we on the verge
of this incredible biological

32:05.316 --> 32:08.646
and evolutionary leap ourselves?

32:08.753 --> 32:11.523
Some believe that mankind's next step

32:11.589 --> 32:14.289
is not in augmenting
our bodies with machines,

32:14.392 --> 32:18.232
but in becoming the machines ourselves.

32:21.032 --> 32:22.632
We can download every connection

32:22.733 --> 32:26.303
that we have in our brain
onto a computer.

32:26.404 --> 32:29.044
These are the kinds
of powers that would have been

32:29.140 --> 32:31.410
viewed as god-like at one previous time.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.189
Geneva, Switzerland.

32:39.258 --> 32:43.228
2013.

32:43.329 --> 32:47.599
Henry Markram founds
the Human Brain Project--

32:47.700 --> 32:51.170
a ten-year scientific venture
funded by the EU,

32:51.237 --> 32:54.267
involving hundreds of researchers

32:54.340 --> 32:58.780
from 135 institutions in 26 countries.

32:58.878 --> 33:02.908
The goal of this project is to
create a fully simulated model

33:02.982 --> 33:07.222
of the human brain inside a computer.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.517
A lot of people are really
excited about the idea of:

33:11.590 --> 33:13.660
if we could map out the structure

33:13.759 --> 33:15.159
of the human brain,

33:15.227 --> 33:17.487
neuron for neuron, and every connection,

33:17.596 --> 33:19.796
then we can download every connection

33:19.865 --> 33:21.325
that we have in our brain,

33:21.433 --> 33:24.873
all that information, onto a computer.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.010
The Human Brain Project is only

33:31.110 --> 33:33.710
one of a number
of brain-mapping ventures.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.949
The next great American project,
and that's what we're calling

33:37.016 --> 33:38.546
the BRAIN Initiative.

33:38.651 --> 33:42.221
In 2013, President Barack Obama

33:42.321 --> 33:45.191
unveiled a $4.5 billion project

33:45.291 --> 33:47.691
called the BRAIN Initiative.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.159
And Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen

33:52.231 --> 33:55.601
has invested over $500 million

33:55.668 --> 33:59.398
in the Allen Institute
for Brain Science.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.805
Futurists speculate that if

34:01.907 --> 34:03.637
these initiatives are successful,

34:03.742 --> 34:06.682
the implications could be profound.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.880
Imagine having every piece

34:13.953 --> 34:16.592
of knowledge that every human
has ever collected.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.717
And if you crunch that down

34:20.759 --> 34:23.359
into a digital consciousness...

34:23.462 --> 34:26.632
that's going to unlock everything.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.708
We can know things about the world

34:34.806 --> 34:36.467
and about life

34:36.574 --> 34:39.975
that no individuals have
ever previously known,

34:40.079 --> 34:44.649
because they're all from the aggregation

34:44.750 --> 34:47.820
of all of human knowledge
that's going together.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.393
So these are the kinds of powers
that would have been

34:50.489 --> 34:54.059
viewed as god-like in previous eras.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.534
Could we be on the verge

35:00.633 --> 35:03.603
of creating a superhuman intelligence,

35:03.669 --> 35:06.669
able to outperform a human at any task?

35:08.107 --> 35:09.867
And if so,

35:09.975 --> 35:13.475
are we at risk of being replaced
by machines entirely?

35:15.881 --> 35:17.581
Transhumanists believe

35:17.650 --> 35:20.780
what lies ahead
could actually be a merging

35:20.886 --> 35:23.346
of man and machine.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.960
If we can map
the human brain into technology,

35:32.064 --> 35:34.904
then I could take your brain

35:35.000 --> 35:37.730
or somebody else's brain

35:37.836 --> 35:41.506
and copy it into a computer.

35:41.607 --> 35:45.977
A technological one that could
potentially live forever.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.821
What happens if we gain the ability

35:51.917 --> 35:55.317
to upload our consciousness
into some sort

35:55.421 --> 35:59.091
of cloud virtual Internet technology?

36:00.893 --> 36:05.803
It's not that far from the
spectrum of a realizable goal,

36:05.898 --> 36:09.728
because we're already seeing
neurological implants

36:09.802 --> 36:12.742
that can be put into the brain,
that can be used

36:12.805 --> 36:15.705
to control the movement
of an artificial arm.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.076
What happens if those neural implants

36:20.145 --> 36:21.975
can actually take the true essence

36:22.081 --> 36:24.551
of what it means to be conscious,

36:24.616 --> 36:27.516
and break that down into
some sort of pure information

36:27.619 --> 36:31.419
that could live apart
from a biological substrate?

36:32.991 --> 36:35.791
It could make itself far more massive,

36:35.894 --> 36:37.164
far more intelligent,

36:37.262 --> 36:40.432
than any human ever had been before.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.067
Could extraterrestrials have

36:47.172 --> 36:50.112
steered our evolution
towards technology,

36:50.175 --> 36:54.805
so that we may merge man
directly with machine,

36:54.880 --> 36:57.780
eliminating our biological restraints?

36:59.351 --> 37:02.891
And if so, might our futures
lie entirely

37:02.988 --> 37:07.618
in a digital realm of silicon
and bits of code?

37:07.693 --> 37:10.893
Many believe the answer lies
not in what we are becoming,

37:10.963 --> 37:14.033
but where we are going.

37:14.133 --> 37:18.973
It won't be long
before mankind has reached

37:19.071 --> 37:21.771
the point where we have

37:21.874 --> 37:24.114
the technology
and the artificial intelligence

37:24.209 --> 37:25.979
to leave our planet

37:26.078 --> 37:29.878
and go into space, just like
extraterrestrials before us.

37:32.117 --> 37:35.087
So you've got to wonder:
are extraterrestrials

37:35.154 --> 37:37.994
somehow guiding us and manipulating us

37:38.056 --> 37:40.486
into this new future,

37:40.592 --> 37:44.232
and this new human,
that we are destined to be?

37:47.833 --> 37:50.873
Is it possible that
extraterrestrials have led us

37:50.969 --> 37:53.439
to a post-biological future,

37:53.505 --> 37:57.235
so that we can rejoin them
in the cosmos?

37:57.309 --> 38:01.609
And if so, might they have
used these same technologies

38:01.680 --> 38:04.580
to visit Earth in the distant past?

38:08.053 --> 38:11.223
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

38:11.323 --> 38:13.023
and look to NASA's own attempts

38:13.125 --> 38:15.025
at re-engineering man

38:15.127 --> 38:17.587
for space.

38:23.494 --> 38:26.464
New York City, 1961.

38:28.532 --> 38:31.572
Psychopharmacologist Nathan S. Kline

38:31.635 --> 38:34.865
and cybernetic mathematician
Manfred Clynes

38:34.972 --> 38:37.972
co-publish a paper
about human space travel

38:38.075 --> 38:42.075
entitled "Drugs, Space,
and Cybernetics."

38:44.181 --> 38:46.921
The two coin the term "cyborg"--

38:46.984 --> 38:49.794
an enhanced human being
specifically doctored

38:49.887 --> 38:51.987
to survive in extraterrestrial
environments

38:52.089 --> 38:54.159
without a space suit.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.560
In their paper,
they detailed various ways

38:59.663 --> 39:02.703
in which to modify
the human body for survival

39:02.800 --> 39:06.440
beyond Earth, and later
served as the inspiration

39:06.537 --> 39:10.567
for NASA's study
"Engineering Man for Space."

39:13.644 --> 39:17.014
Our bodies are
not suited for living in space.

39:17.114 --> 39:21.384
After only a few days, we
experience muscle and bone loss.

39:21.452 --> 39:24.892
One has to wonder if extraterrestrials

39:24.989 --> 39:27.519
experience the same type of problems.

39:29.026 --> 39:32.186
I do think that any beings that are able

39:32.263 --> 39:36.703
to cross the cosmos
and visit this planet

39:36.800 --> 39:41.070
will have learned how
to self-direct their evolution,

39:41.172 --> 39:43.442
to survive in deep space

39:43.541 --> 39:45.541
for extraordinarily
long periods of time.

39:45.643 --> 39:48.483
Those beings, more than likely,

39:48.579 --> 39:50.249
will be, at least, bio-digital,

39:50.347 --> 39:52.977
meaning that they have merged
with their technologies.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.653
Or they will be pure digital beings.

39:55.753 --> 39:59.393
These may be robots or cyborgs.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.630
Could extraterrestrials have used

40:08.732 --> 40:13.242
the same cyborg technologies
we are just now developing?

40:14.738 --> 40:17.968
If so, might our push
towards transhumanism

40:18.075 --> 40:21.535
really be inspired by an innate desire

40:21.645 --> 40:24.575
to travel further into space...

40:24.682 --> 40:26.922
and seek out our creators?

40:30.821 --> 40:33.761
There has been a consistent path towards

40:33.857 --> 40:36.157
the fusion of human and machine

40:36.260 --> 40:38.060
throughout all of our history--

40:38.162 --> 40:40.902
this idea that we could
somehow advance ourselves

40:40.965 --> 40:43.025
for the betterment of humankind

40:43.133 --> 40:44.733
through this merger

40:44.835 --> 40:48.465
of technology and biology.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.242
I think that what will happen

40:50.341 --> 40:54.141
is that our biological bodies

40:54.211 --> 40:56.251
will be able to be perfected,

40:56.347 --> 40:59.207
any imperfections corrected.

40:59.316 --> 41:02.076
Our mental abilities and lifespan

41:02.186 --> 41:04.616
will be enhanced considerably.

41:04.722 --> 41:08.322
And we will be ready, ourselves,
to go into space

41:08.425 --> 41:12.425
and ultimately join
our creators in the stars.

41:17.234 --> 41:20.144
Is it possible extraterrestrials left us

41:20.237 --> 41:22.167
with the tools to mold ourselves

41:22.273 --> 41:24.973
into a truly transhuman species...

41:27.211 --> 41:28.811
...one without any limits,

41:28.912 --> 41:32.752
capable of traveling the stars at will?

41:32.850 --> 41:36.690
Or could nanomachines,
artificial intelligence,

41:36.787 --> 41:41.387
and the digital revolution
render humans obsolete?

41:41.492 --> 41:45.292
Our lives and the very nature
of our existence

41:45.396 --> 41:48.956
may balance on this choice,

41:49.066 --> 41:53.396
a choice that is coming
much sooner than we think.
