NARRATOR:
And now, a Paramount Plus
made-for-TV movie.

00:13.614 --> 00:17.618
"It's not a movie--
it's a made-for-TV movie."

00:20.888 --> 00:22.723
NARRATOR:
From the green hills of Vermont

00:22.823 --> 00:24.892
to the verdant canyons
of Arizona,

00:24.992 --> 00:27.961
people all over the country
are beginning to realize

00:28.062 --> 00:29.863
it's nearly over!

00:29.963 --> 00:34.034
We have almost beaten COVID
and the best news of all:

00:36.904 --> 00:38.939
Infections are
at an all-time low.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.675
New, stronger vaccinations
have ebbed the tide.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.911
And we humans
are cleaning up the mess

00:44.011 --> 00:46.347
and finally
getting on with our lives.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.650
But as we start to get back
to our jobs and schools,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.452
one question remains:

00:51.552 --> 00:55.256
What lingering effects will
the pandemic have on children?

00:55.356 --> 00:58.959
Some say no effect at all.
The children are just fine.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.628
-(chiming)
-We came together

01:00.728 --> 01:02.130
and finally we can say,
we are starting to

01:02.230 --> 01:04.198
-win the war against COVID.
-WOMAN: Stan?

01:04.298 --> 01:06.200
Stan, the phone's for you!

01:06.300 --> 01:07.835
Stan!

01:07.935 --> 01:10.304
What?!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.340
Could you not hear me?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.642
Yeah, dude,
but I'm busy working.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.477
Working on getting drunk again.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.011
I'm not "getting drunk,"

01:18.112 --> 01:20.080
I'm an online
whiskey consultant.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.415
I'm doing research.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.451
Everyone needs
to leave me alone.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.486
The guy on the phone
said it's important.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.722
He said his name
is Kyle Broflovski.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.091
Kyle?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.696
-Hello?
-KYLE: Oh, hi.

01:35.796 --> 01:39.367
Is this Stan Marsh,
from South Park?

01:39.467 --> 01:42.035
-Kyle?
-Oh, dude, it is you!

01:42.136 --> 01:44.205
How have you--
How have you been?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.807
I'm... fine. How are you?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.242
I'm good, I'm...

01:48.342 --> 01:50.678
I know this is weird.
We haven't talked since...

01:50.778 --> 01:52.713
well, you know,
since it all happened.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.417
Yeah, well, the pandemic
is about over now.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.918
I'm moving on with my life.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.421
Stan...
you should come back here.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.556
There's a lot going on.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.193
There's nothing in
South Park for me, Kyle!

02:05.293 --> 02:07.195
I'm not going back there, ever.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.630
Look, dude, you remember
when we were little?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.699
When the pandemic...
first started.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.434
Us friends said
we'd always be there

02:13.534 --> 02:14.802
for each other
when things got bad.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.238
What do you mean?
What's happened?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.606
Stan...

02:18.706 --> 02:21.775
It's Kenny. He's dead.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.911

02:47.868 --> 02:51.239
Tonight's guest,
First Lady Tom Kardashian!

02:51.339 --> 02:55.976
And now here he is,
the king of woke comedy, Jimmy!

02:56.076 --> 02:58.145
(audience cheering)

02:58.246 --> 02:59.447
Wow.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.649
Wow, what a terrific audience.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.017
What a fantastic audience, wow.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.386
(cheering quiets)

03:05.486 --> 03:08.021
Geez, what's the deal
with these Mexicans, huh?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.290
(laughter)

03:09.390 --> 03:11.124
I mean, they have fabulous food,

03:11.225 --> 03:12.926
their country
has amazing beaches,

03:13.026 --> 03:16.230
and they're
really fantastic people.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.698
(cheering and applause)

03:17.798 --> 03:19.667
Wow, what a great audience.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.935
You know,
today I was on the subway

03:22.035 --> 03:24.238
and I saw an ad
for the Center for People

03:24.338 --> 03:27.708
Who Identify as Homosexual
But Were Born Bi.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.277
-(laughter)
-Have you seen this?

03:29.377 --> 03:30.544
Have you heard about this?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.079
I'll tell you one thing--

03:32.179 --> 03:33.647
those people are brave
and deserve

03:33.747 --> 03:36.417
-every ounce of our respect.
-(cheering)

03:36.517 --> 03:37.851
S-Stick around.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.687
First Lady Tom Kardashian
is here.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.789
We'll be right back!

03:41.889 --> 03:43.090
(band playing in distance)

03:43.190 --> 03:44.692
Jimmy, we got
a call from corporate.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.159
They want you to cut
the hummus joke.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.395
What?!

03:47.495 --> 03:49.129
It's hard enough
doing comedy these days.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.898
Now I'm getting notes
during commercial breaks?!

03:50.998 --> 03:53.000
You're just gonna have to joke
about something else.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.035
All right, fine, what else
is going on in the news? Quick!

03:55.135 --> 03:58.339
Uh, Amazon thinks they might
have discovered gold on Mars.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.073
Ah, Jesus. Anything else?

04:00.173 --> 04:02.376
Uh, that famous
eccentric scientist died.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.513
The millionaire philanthropist?
Dr. McCormick?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.650
Kenny? Kenny's dead?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.352
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you know him?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.721
We were friends when we
were kids. Let me see that!

04:13.821 --> 04:16.023
ANNOUNCER: "Very
mysterious circumstances."

04:16.123 --> 04:18.292
That's what doctors
are saying about

04:18.392 --> 04:19.760
the death of beloved scientist

04:19.860 --> 04:22.396
and humanitarian,
Dr. Kenny McCormick.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.299
McCormick was a pioneer of
science and technology

04:25.399 --> 04:28.402
who was always trying to unlock
the key to a better future.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.772
He worked tirelessly--
some say balls-out crazily--

04:31.872 --> 04:33.574
on new inventions and theories

04:33.674 --> 04:36.710
but somehow his biggest
questions seemed to elude him.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.879
The head of NASA said,
"We have lost

04:38.979 --> 04:40.714
"an innovator and a visionary.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.016
"Kenny was so brilliant
that most of the time,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.786
we couldn't even understand
what he was saying."

04:47.120 --> 04:48.822
Get me a first-class ticket
to South Park!

04:48.922 --> 04:51.625
What? You can't leave!
You have to get back onstage!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.293
The first lady is here!

04:53.394 --> 04:55.095
Tell Tom Kardashian to suck my

04:55.195 --> 04:58.231
P-P-Popsicles
that are in the green room,

04:58.332 --> 04:59.500
and that I am very sorry,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.301
and that he is
a fantastic person.

WOMAN:
Stan?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.719
Stan, wake up,
I think we're here.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.030
So that's it, huh?

05:30.130 --> 05:33.066
-That's the town you grew up in?
-STAN: Yeah.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.770
Well, how does it feel to
be back after all these years?

05:37.571 --> 05:40.207
It feels shitty, okay?
Can you please shut the fuck up?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.743
Why did you even bring me
along if you're not going

05:42.843 --> 05:44.344
to let me help you
through this?!

05:44.445 --> 05:45.746

06:04.031 --> 06:08.168

through the polluted air *

* Walking on a wire *

06:11.672 --> 06:13.240
* Running out of time *

06:13.340 --> 06:16.944
* There's no room
in this ol' heart of mine *

06:17.044 --> 06:21.381
* So much pressure
to keep holdin' on *

06:21.482 --> 06:27.054
* Pack my clothes up, baby,
I'll be gone *

06:27.154 --> 06:31.124
* Stir it up, I've got to
break it up now *

06:31.224 --> 06:32.893
* When I think about tomorrow *

06:32.993 --> 06:35.796
* I can't wait to *

06:35.896 --> 06:38.031
* Stir it up *

06:38.131 --> 06:39.867
* Got to shake it up now *

06:39.967 --> 06:42.069
* If I have to beg or borrow *

06:42.169 --> 06:43.671
* I don't wanna *

06:43.771 --> 06:46.740
* Take it anymore *

06:46.840 --> 06:49.009
* Got to break it up now *

06:49.109 --> 06:51.845
* When I think about tomorrow *

06:51.945 --> 06:54.515

and let your taste buds soar!

06:58.151 --> 07:01.455
Denny's is now
Denny's Applebee's Max.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.956
Come taste the difference.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.826
(woman speaking Japanese)

07:13.033 --> 07:17.037
(soft electronic music playing)

07:18.205 --> 07:20.040
(sighs)

07:21.074 --> 07:23.043
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, dude.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.680
Wow. This is crazy, huh?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.916
I mean, how long has it been?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.785
I guess...
since we were nine.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.453
Well, have a seat.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.923
What have you been up to?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.457
Oh, dude,
just all kinds of stuff.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.026
You know, getting stuff going.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.695
Got my own online
whiskey consultant gig.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.230
I'm totally happy.
What about you?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.098
Oh, I'm getting things
going, too.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.435
I'm doing a sort of counseling
online start-up thing.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.837
Really doing great, too.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.339
-Sweet.
-Listen, Stan...

07:52.439 --> 07:55.976
I know that we disagreed
a lot during the pandemic,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.645
but I hope we can
put that aside...

07:57.745 --> 08:00.247
Dude, Kyle,
I'm just here for Kenny.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.849
All right, well,

08:01.949 --> 08:04.484
there's something you should
know about the way Kenny died.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.087
Hi, guys, welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.922
I see you
got your menus already.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.190
As you're deciding
what to order,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.525
I just want to go over
a couple things.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.960
Now, of course, it is the future

08:13.060 --> 08:14.928
so we don't have any meat
on the menu.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.630
'Cause you know,
here in the future,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.866
we've all decided meat is wrong.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.200
Yeah, we know.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.035
Okay, and, uh,
you'll see there's

08:22.135 --> 08:24.237
some dishes made
from insect protein on the menu.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.439
That, of course, is because
here in the future,

08:26.540 --> 08:28.341
we've all learned that insects
are a valuable and sustainable

08:28.441 --> 08:31.645
food and we no longer
fear it as a food. Mm-hmm.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.280
We know, dude.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.515
Okay, well, if you have any
questions, please don't hesitate

08:35.616 --> 08:38.351
to say anything, because,
you know, it's the future.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.521
We've learned to all just
get along and love each other.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.225
Look, Stan,
Kenny was trying to find

08:45.325 --> 08:47.460
the answers
to some pretty heavy stuff.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.130
He felt like there
were people responsible

08:50.230 --> 08:51.732
for everything that's happened.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.433
Like who?

08:53.533 --> 08:57.070
That's just it. Nobody knows.
But whoever these people are,

08:57.170 --> 08:59.707
they didn't want
Kenny McCormick exposing them.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.875
Wait a minute. Token?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.543
Yeah, it's me.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.979
Just before he died,
Kenny was texting me

09:06.079 --> 09:07.815
that he was on
to something huge.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.416
And he was texting me, too.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.018
Saying he'd discovered
something that

09:11.118 --> 09:12.319
could change the world.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.654
And then he died,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
and the hospital won't say how.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.090
And that got us thinking...

09:17.190 --> 09:20.427
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.164
I'm just here for the funeral.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.867
I don't want to be a part
of anything else.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.201
Dude, there might be
people to blame

09:28.301 --> 09:30.303
for ruining our childhoods.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.105
So what do you wanna do, Kyle?

09:32.205 --> 09:35.108
Go on some bullshit adventure
like when we were kids?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.444
Maybe, maybe we can call
Jesus and Santa

09:37.544 --> 09:40.547
and ask them for help.
Is that what you want?

09:40.648 --> 09:44.184
It's the fucking future,
you guys. Grow up.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.360
Hello, welcome to
the Super 12 Motel Plus.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.729
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, Stan Marsh.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.530
I have a room for one night.

09:57.631 --> 10:02.169
Okay, I see you're in one of
our Mach Ten Super Plus rooms.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.571
Now, of course,
we only take Bitcoin

10:04.672 --> 10:06.106
and other cryptocurrency 'cause,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.607
you know, it's the future.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.609
We've all decided
centralized banking is rigged,

10:09.710 --> 10:12.479
so we trust more in
fly-by-night Ponzi schemes.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.081
Yeah, I know.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.319
So you walked out on
all your friends and then

10:19.419 --> 10:21.188
just hung out at a bar all day?

10:21.288 --> 10:24.825
Alexa, fucking just go
throw yourself out a window.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.160
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite get that.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.463
Nothing.
Alexa, turn on the TV.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.867
Oh, God, you are
such a piece of shit.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.268
-(TV chimes)
-You know,

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
if you had
Remote Prime membership,

10:37.204 --> 10:39.106
you could watch Amazon movies
wherever you go.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.674
Would you like to get started?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.409
-No.
-I'm sorry.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.644
I'm trying
to be fucking helpful.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.147
Why don't you grow up
and start acting like an adult

10:47.247 --> 10:48.615
for once in your life...

10:48.716 --> 10:49.817
Alexa, stop!

10:49.917 --> 10:51.051
Fuck you!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.754
(news theme volume increases)

10:53.854 --> 10:57.624
Jon, I'm standing outside
the South Park Flash Rail Max,

10:57.725 --> 10:59.492
where hundreds of people
are coming to

10:59.592 --> 11:02.495
pay their respects
to Dr. Kenny McCormick.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.098
There's still no word
from the hospital

11:05.198 --> 11:07.300
on what exactly
killed Kenny McCormick,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.669
but letters sent to multiple
news outlets reveal

11:09.770 --> 11:12.439
that he might have
known his life was in danger.

11:12.539 --> 11:16.643
Dr. McCormick said,
"I am about to expose the truth.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.112
"In the event of my death
I have hidden away

11:19.212 --> 11:20.714
"all relevant information.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.717
My closest friends
will know where to find it."

11:23.817 --> 11:25.385
Dr. Kenneth McCormick.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.255
He wanted to make the future
a better place.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.259
Too bad he died, 'cause
the future certainly sucks.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.528
* *

11:43.003 --> 11:44.037
(doorbell rings)

11:44.137 --> 11:46.373
* Someone's at the door *

11:46.473 --> 11:48.375
* This is the doorbell *

11:48.475 --> 11:51.879
* It's the future
so doorbells sing. *

11:51.979 --> 11:54.047
Yeah, I know.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.784
Okay, so you were right.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.318
Kenny was on to some bad people

11:58.418 --> 12:00.387
and he hid something
for us to find.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.222
Yeah, I saw.
Only problem is

12:02.322 --> 12:03.656
I don't know
what he's talking about.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.625
But thank you
for saying I was right.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.560
You're welcome. It doesn't mean
that you were right

12:07.660 --> 12:08.929
about everything
during the pandemic.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.930
Because you weren't.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.498
Okay, well, obviously

12:11.598 --> 12:13.433
we're never going to agree
on certain things,

12:13.533 --> 12:15.068
so we shouldn't talk about them.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.805
Sounds good.
So let's go to Kenny's wake

12:17.905 --> 12:19.339
and see if anyone else shows up

12:19.439 --> 12:21.108
who might know what
Kenny's talking about.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.043
Let's do that.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.615
(busy chatter)

12:30.617 --> 12:33.486
Hello. Testing.
Hey, everybody.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.056
It's amazing to see you all
here for Kenny's wake.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.725
Wow, what a great audience.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.327
Uh, for those of you
who don't know,

12:40.427 --> 12:41.829
my name is Jimmy Valmer and, uh,

12:41.929 --> 12:44.764
I had to take an Asian airline
to get here today.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.566
You know what they say
about Asian airlines--

12:46.666 --> 12:48.235
they're dependable
and just as efficient

12:48.335 --> 12:50.103
as any other competent airline.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.672
(whooping and cheering)

12:52.772 --> 12:54.541
What a terrific audience.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.643
So many people
have come for Kenny today--

12:56.743 --> 12:59.779
so many amazing friends
I haven't seen in ages.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.682
You know, I had a friend once
who was a Polish hair stylist.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.685
Talk about an amazing haircut
at an affordable price.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.288
(whooping and cheering)

13:08.388 --> 13:09.823
Well, I know that
we're all ready

13:09.923 --> 13:11.791
to talk to each other
and share our memories of Kenny.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.660
So please just have fun
and we'll see you

13:13.760 --> 13:16.063
-at the funeral tomorrow.
-(applause)

13:16.163 --> 13:18.999
(electronic drumbeat playing)

13:19.099 --> 13:21.334
* We are all, you and me *

13:21.434 --> 13:24.504
* We are all living
in the future *

13:24.604 --> 13:26.673
* We are all in the future... *

13:26.773 --> 13:28.141
-(groans)
-Stan?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.277
-Stan Marsh?
-Yeah?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.679
Hi. It's Wendy.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.982
Wendy Testaburger, wow.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.050
Yeah. My husband, Darwin.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.718
Hey, pal, how are ya?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.921
Hey, guys.
It's Tweek and Craig.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.689
Oh, hey.
How are you guys?

13:42.789 --> 13:43.924
We're good.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.392
(straining):
I have a lot of anxiety

13:45.492 --> 13:46.726
being back
with all these people!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.595
Wendy's told me a lot
about you, Stan.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.864
How's everything
with the family?

13:50.964 --> 13:54.401
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
get, uh, drunk.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.736
-What's wrong with Stan?
-We're just...

13:56.836 --> 13:58.505
trying to find out
what happened to Kenny.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.574
I think this goes deeper
than you guys realize.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.979
Hey, Stan Marsh!
Good to see you.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.081
It's me, Clyde Donovan.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.449
Oh, hey, Clyde.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.784
What have you been doing
during the pandemic?

14:11.885 --> 14:13.386
Oh, you know, lots of stuff.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.423
Yeah, me, too.
Sucks about Kenny, huh?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.590
Hope they find
all the information

14:17.690 --> 14:19.559
-on that thing he hid.
-You know

14:19.659 --> 14:21.128
where he might have hid it?

14:21.228 --> 14:24.697
No, I don't.
But I bet someone here does.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.900
It's really great
to see you guys again.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.502
These past few decades
have been really tough.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.772
Yeah, sometimes I think
the pandemic really aged me.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.475
Kyle, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:36.276 --> 14:39.246
-Dude, he's here.
-Who's here?

14:40.313 --> 14:43.216
-Cartman?
-Yeah, but he's changed.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.584
Changed how?

14:44.684 --> 14:46.453
Yes, I know,
it's been a long time

14:46.553 --> 14:47.754
since we've seen each other.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.122
I'm doing really well.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.091
I'm actually the head
of Gespetzah Synagogue

14:51.191 --> 14:52.392
down in Colorado Springs.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.461
Can you believe it?
I'm a rabbi.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.998
Yeah, you know, when
the whole pandemic happened,

14:58.098 --> 14:59.299
I think it changed me.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.334
It really changed me
for the better.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.769
-It did?
-No.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.472
-He's fucking with me.
-What? Oh, yeah.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.175
Yeah, I get it,
the Eric Cartman you guys knew

15:08.275 --> 15:10.043
didn't seem like
he'd become a rabbi.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.179
But I found real meaning
in the Torah

15:12.279 --> 15:14.281
and then I found a great
Jewish woman and...

15:14.381 --> 15:17.284
let the spirit of the Talmud
guide our lives.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.952
Okay, jut knock it off, fat-ass.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.220
Dude.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.821
Wow, that's very big
of you, Kyle.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.824
Still living in South Park
and calling people fat-ass, huh?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.127
Wait, I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.795
It's not fucking funny, Cartman!

15:28.895 --> 15:31.398
Stop pretending you
have a happy Jewish life!

15:31.498 --> 15:33.033
Hey, shoogina!
I'm sorry, I couldn't

15:33.133 --> 15:35.902
wait in the car anymore;
I had to meet your friends.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.972
Oh, that's okay.
Guys, this is my wife, Yentl.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.674
I've heard so many stories
about you all.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.543
It must have been amazing
to grow up

15:43.643 --> 15:45.412
in these beautiful mountains!

15:45.512 --> 15:47.981
Yentl? Her name is Yentl?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.384
Can we fucking stop this
and talk about Kenny, please?!

15:51.484 --> 15:55.422
-Oh, is that, uh...?
-Yeah, that's-that's Kyle, yeah.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.490
I'm sorry, honey, can you
just give me a couple minutes?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.392
I just need a few more
seconds with them

15:59.492 --> 16:00.527
and I'll be right out
to the car.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.029
Oh, okay, I get it.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.396
Nice to meet you guys.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.365
We'll see you at the funeral,
I guess.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.400
And I'm very sorry
for your loss.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.103
Bye, Mrs. Cartman.

16:10.203 --> 16:14.041
Okay, look, guys, Kenny and I
were still really good friends.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.144
He used to email me all the time
about stuff he was doing.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.411
Yeah, me, too!

16:18.511 --> 16:20.180
Well, so then maybe he also

16:20.280 --> 16:22.149
told you that
he was trying to find

16:22.249 --> 16:23.950
the origin of the coronavirus.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.718
What are you talking about?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.855
Kenny was obsessed with
how corona first got started.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.492
He was clearly on to something,
and then he died.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.894
I know we all want
to solve this for him.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.996
You know, in the Torah,
when Abraham

16:37.097 --> 16:38.298
first heard the word of God...

16:38.398 --> 16:39.999
Just knock it off!
You don't believe

16:40.100 --> 16:41.534
a word of that shit.
You're just doing all this

16:41.634 --> 16:43.002
to get a rise out of me.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.237
Kyle, you really think

16:44.337 --> 16:45.672
I would spend 40 years
of my life

16:45.772 --> 16:47.340
just to get a rise out of you?

16:47.440 --> 16:50.077
-Yes, I do!
-Same ol' Kyle.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.478
Well, I got to go, guys.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.713
I'll see you at Kenny's funeral
tomorrow.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.684
Maybe he's really changed.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.521
No. He is fucking with me.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.801
INTERVIEWER (on TV):
Sometimes I feel like

17:14.901 --> 17:17.170
things weren't supposed
to be like this.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.307
Like maybe there are others
in control of the way

17:20.407 --> 17:21.841
it all turned out.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.043
Is that what you're saying,
Dr. McCormick?

17:24.144 --> 17:27.747
Are you saying that there are
other people responsible?

17:27.847 --> 17:31.118
I guess what I'm trying to say,
Dr. McCormick, is...

17:31.218 --> 17:34.954
your theories seem to point to
some kind of people with power.

17:35.054 --> 17:39.126
Let me put it another way--
we've all seen the pictures

17:39.226 --> 17:41.594
of you working in Egypt,
lecturing at MIT.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.131
And you always seem to
come back to this concept

17:44.231 --> 17:47.400
of this mysterious
organization who is to blame.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.469
-Let me put it yet
another way, Dr. McCormick.
-Hang on a second.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.439
What was that?
Alexa, freeze the video.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.973
-What?
-Freeze video

17:54.073 --> 17:56.476
and reverse playback
ten seconds.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.513
Stop there.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.352
Enhance image 20%.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.886
Ugh. Whatever.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.855
(beeps, whirs)

18:10.390 --> 18:11.924
Shift right ten frames.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.026
(beeps, whirs)

18:14.127 --> 18:15.061
Enhance.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.696
(beeps, whirs)

18:16.796 --> 18:18.731
ALEXA:
Tegridy Weed?

18:18.831 --> 18:22.302
Isn't that your dad's
old marijuana company?

18:22.402 --> 18:25.738
Oh, shit.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.874
* *

18:34.514 --> 18:38.050
Hi. Welcome.
Welcome, my friends.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.719
So blessed to have you here.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.121
Hello, my child,
thank you for coming.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.090
-Yeah, sure.
-Wait, Stan?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.658
Stan Marsh?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.328
Praise be!
I haven't seen you in ages!

18:48.428 --> 18:50.029
I'm sorry, do I know you?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.464
Well, sure, it's me!

18:51.564 --> 18:53.866
Scott Malkinson!
Remember me?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.936
-Uh, no, sorry.
-I hung out with you guys

18:57.036 --> 18:58.805
all the time
when we were little.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.640
I was the kid with the lisp.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.643
-Who had diabetes?
-Oh, yeah, sure...

19:03.743 --> 19:06.213
Great to see you again.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.715
Hey, guys.
Great to see you in church.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.883
-It's Scott Malkinson.
-Who?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.353
Scott Malkinson, I went
to school with you guys?

19:13.453 --> 19:14.754
Oh, okay.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.725
Hello. Welcome. Hey!
It's me! Scott Malkinson!

19:18.825 --> 19:21.494
With the diabetes. No?

19:22.362 --> 19:26.599
Kenny McCormick was
a cherished son, a wise man,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.134
and a wonderful friend.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.169
Kenny touched all
of our lives and made

19:30.270 --> 19:34.207
each and every one of us
laugh, cry and ponder.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.708
And in his death,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.511
now we can reflect on
our own lives.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.880
Are we happy?

19:40.980 --> 19:44.217
Are we the person
we hoped to be?

19:44.317 --> 19:47.820
Have we, like Kenny,
given all that we can

19:47.920 --> 19:50.056
to forgive those around us?

19:50.156 --> 19:51.724
For life is short,

19:51.824 --> 19:54.794
and our family and friends
must be cherished.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.298
You know, in many ways,
death is like diabetes.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.133
You spend your whole life
trying to fight it off

20:01.234 --> 20:03.903
but ultimately it just wins.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.574
And so let's take the time now
to reach out to our friends.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.108
To reach out to our family.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.744
To tell our mothers
and our fathers that we...

20:11.844 --> 20:14.747
All right! All right! Who
the fuck put you up to this?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.916
Did you write
this goddamn speech, Kyle?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.685
Did you tell him
to say all this stuff?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.120
What the fuck
are you talking about?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.122
You know that I know something
about Kenny

20:23.222 --> 20:25.525
that I'm not telling you because
it involves my father,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.093
who I don't want to face!

20:27.193 --> 20:29.762
That's crazy and you'd be able
to face what happened

20:29.862 --> 20:32.064
to your family if you
weren't a fucking asshole!

20:32.164 --> 20:34.601
Guys, please,
this is a house of God.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.035
You shut the fuck up!

20:36.135 --> 20:39.205
You judge me,
you all sit here and judge me.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.040
Well, fuck all of you!

20:41.140 --> 20:43.910
This is exactly why I moved out
of this hick-ass town!

20:44.010 --> 20:45.912
And I am going back home
to the city!

20:46.012 --> 20:48.281
My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ...

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
(mockingly): My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.719
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.156
He does remember me!

20:57.256 --> 20:59.592
Alexa, start the car!

21:00.527 --> 21:02.329
Start the car?
Where are you going?

21:02.429 --> 21:04.764
I need to stop at a store
and then we're going home.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.433
What about the connection
you just found

21:06.533 --> 21:07.834
between Kenny and your father?

21:07.934 --> 21:10.169
Alexa, find the nearest
liquor store.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.771
Oh, you wanna get drunk?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.773
Let me guess-- someone said
something you didn't like

21:13.873 --> 21:16.008
and it made you want to
pound beer and wine?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.910
It's not
"pounding beer and wine."

21:18.010 --> 21:19.946
I drop wine shots into the beer.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.181
It's called a "smorgasvein"
and it's very cultural!

21:22.281 --> 21:25.151
Stop acting like a child and
support your dead friend, Stan!

21:25.251 --> 21:28.120
-You don't even have any...
-Alexa, stop!

21:29.589 --> 21:30.723
(car beeps)

21:30.823 --> 21:33.025
(tires screeching)

21:34.126 --> 21:35.895
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.331
Hello, everyone.
My name is Rabbi Cartman

21:38.431 --> 21:42.001
and I was Kenny McCormick's
very, very best friend.

21:42.101 --> 21:46.272
Kenny was not a Jew,
but he had so many

21:46.373 --> 21:48.007
amazing Jewish qualities.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.176
Qualities that I see
in my loving wife

21:50.276 --> 21:53.846
and my amazing kids,
that are right over there.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.615
Over there by Kyle.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.950
And as we all return now
to our homes

21:58.050 --> 22:00.820
and our lives, I think that--
a lot like Abraham--

22:00.920 --> 22:03.490
-let's not forget that...
-Excuse me. Everyone?

22:03.590 --> 22:04.924
Hello?

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

22:07.126 --> 22:10.830
We got results from the PNR scan
of Dr. McCormick's remains

22:10.930 --> 22:13.065
and we now know
the cause of his death.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.536
-(murmuring)
-Now we all need to stay calm.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.472
There is no reason
to panic, but...

22:19.572 --> 22:21.874
Kenny died of COVID.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.242
It's a new variant.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.847
The COVID Delta Plus
Rewards Program variant.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.650
(all screaming)

22:30.750 --> 22:32.084
Everyone, please!

22:32.184 --> 22:33.753
We cannot panic!

22:33.853 --> 22:36.088
(all screaming and clamoring)

22:39.191 --> 22:41.928
(whooshing)

22:42.729 --> 22:45.398
(all screaming)

22:50.970 --> 22:53.105
That's it! We're all out
of chin diapers!

22:53.205 --> 22:55.875
Oh, God, we're all out
of chin diapers!

22:55.975 --> 22:59.311
(frantic groaning)

22:59.412 --> 23:00.447
Zoom...

23:00.547 --> 23:01.848
(muttering)

23:01.948 --> 23:03.583
Come on, come on, come on!
Remote learning!

23:03.683 --> 23:05.618
Come on, come on, come on!

23:05.718 --> 23:09.255
(horns honking)

23:12.459 --> 23:13.860
Alexa, what's going on?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.829
ALEXA: There's some kind
of road closure ahead.

23:23.369 --> 23:26.806
Set up a perimeter!
I want all exit points sealed.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.112
People of South Park,

23:33.212 --> 23:36.048
there is an outbreak of COVID
in your community.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.917
You are being quarantined.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.088
Hey, dude! I don't live here.
I need to get home!

23:42.188 --> 23:44.924
Nobody is going in or out.

23:45.024 --> 23:48.060
We have confirmation that
one person in this community

23:48.160 --> 23:50.563
has never been vaccinated
against COVID,

23:50.663 --> 23:52.899
so we must quarantine everyone.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.635
One person?!
Well, who is it?!

23:55.735 --> 23:57.904
We are not allowed to say.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.106
But if you tell us who
the unvaccinated person is,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.575
we can have them vaccinated
and then this will all be over!

24:02.675 --> 24:06.178
We can't tell you who it is
because, in case you forgot,

24:06.278 --> 24:09.749
it's the future, and we don't
single out or ridicule anyone

24:09.849 --> 24:11.784
for their personal beliefs.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.020
Gah! I hate the future!

24:14.120 --> 24:15.922
What does this mean?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.924
Yeah, what's it mean, Daddy?

24:18.024 --> 24:19.992
I think it means...

24:20.092 --> 24:22.294
we're all stuck in South Park.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.932
(busy chatter)

24:27.934 --> 24:29.101
-(groans)
-Okay, there we go.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.302
We'll get back
with the results.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.771
Maintain six feet
social distance

24:31.871 --> 24:33.205
and stay indoors.
Thank you.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.406
Next, please!

24:35.174 --> 24:36.943
Yeah, listen, I have to
get out of here.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.177
Yes, don't we all.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.679
No, no, no,
I don't belong here

24:39.779 --> 24:41.213
and I don't have
anywhere to stay.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.049
They've shut down
all the motels.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.317
Do you have any friends or
family that you can stay with?

24:45.417 --> 24:47.119
No, these people
are not my friends

24:47.219 --> 24:48.788
and I have no family here.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.723
-Oka-- (groans)
-It's okay.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.291
They've set up
an emergency shelter

24:52.391 --> 24:54.827
for all the people who were here
from out of town.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.129
Where?

24:59.932 --> 25:03.002
(indistinct chatter)

25:12.011 --> 25:13.613
PC PRINCIPAL: All right,
everyone, listen up.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.047
No way.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.183
Welcome to
South Park Elementary.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.451
We want to help you all
be as comfortable as possible.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.854
So we will have quiet time
from 9:00 p.m.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.290
to 6:00 a.m. every day.
I don't want to hear

25:24.390 --> 25:27.259
any fucking gender-specific
language in here.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.562
And if anybody here
casts a movie with someone

25:29.662 --> 25:31.964
other than the culture
that that movie is about,

25:32.064 --> 25:33.600
you are fucking out of here!

25:33.700 --> 25:38.337
All right, thank you.
It is now 9:01. Lights out.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.811
* *

25:50.049 --> 25:53.052
It's been a long time
since I've prayed.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.355
I don't know
if anyone can hear me...

25:56.455 --> 25:59.225
but we all really
need help right now.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.494
I know in my heart
that Kenny didn't just die

26:02.595 --> 26:04.864
of some new COVID variant.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.334
I know there's something
way bigger going on.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.871
But it all seems like
so much to take on.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.540
Please, if there's
anyone who could

26:14.641 --> 26:18.945
help see me through this,
it would be a miracle.

26:19.879 --> 26:20.947
(water splashes)

26:21.047 --> 26:23.315
* *

26:34.460 --> 26:35.728
(doorbell rings)

26:35.828 --> 26:38.297
* Someone's at the door *

26:38.397 --> 26:40.833
-(groans)
-* This is the doorbell *

26:40.933 --> 26:42.669
* Apparently in the future *

26:42.769 --> 26:45.204
* All doorbells
sing, sing, sing. *

26:45.304 --> 26:48.507
Yeah, I fucking know,
goddamn it!

26:49.275 --> 26:52.411
Hey, Kyle.
Oh, man, this is crazy, huh?

26:52.511 --> 26:55.147
The school is all filled up
and the motels are shut down.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.049
I was, I was just hoping
maybe we could crash here.

26:57.149 --> 27:00.086
Look, I, uh,
I don't think that's gonna work.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.421
I figured Stan is probably
staying with you, too?

27:02.521 --> 27:03.756
No. No, he's not.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.025
Oh, great!
Then you have some extra rooms.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.928
-We're gonna be okay, kids!
-KIDS: Yay!

27:09.028 --> 27:10.329
No, no, Cartman,
I'm sure there are

27:10.429 --> 27:11.898
some other places you can stay.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.399
My family would be
really comfortable

27:13.499 --> 27:16.602
in a nice Jewish home.
Please, Kyle, for my kids.

27:17.536 --> 27:20.172
We promise we'll be good,
Uncle Kyle.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.774
Please, Uncle Kyle?

27:21.874 --> 27:23.910
Please,
Uncle Kyle?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.344
I can't believe this.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.313
Come on, kids!
Oh, bless you, Kyle.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.181
Don't worry,
I'll put them right to bed.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.383
You won't even know we're here.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.652
Toda raba, Uncle Kyle.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.988
That's Hebrew for "thank you."

27:40.993 --> 27:43.796
(quiet chatter)

27:43.896 --> 27:47.399
Guys, doesn't this all
seem a little too convenient?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.634
What do you mean?

27:48.735 --> 27:50.002
I mean that Kenny's death
is suspicious,

27:50.102 --> 27:52.104
he talks about people
to blame and then

27:52.204 --> 27:54.406
he suddenly dies of
some new COVID variant?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.208
You think it's a cover, Token?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.377
I think it's
definitely suspicious.

27:58.477 --> 28:01.180
Speaking of suspicious,
what do you call a trans woman

28:01.280 --> 28:03.382
that walks into
an abortion clinic?

28:04.216 --> 28:07.787
Her name is Rebecca
and she's a fantastic person.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.757
Just seems all nice
and buttoned up, doesn't it?

28:10.857 --> 28:13.125
It's a perfect cause of death
and anyone who's trying

28:13.225 --> 28:14.894
to sort it out is quarantined

28:14.994 --> 28:16.796
because one person
isn't vaccinated?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.866
It's true-- who wouldn't be
vaccinated by now?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.267
I'm certainly vaccinated.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.635
-Yeah, I'm vaccinated.
-Me, too.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.137
We're all vaccinated.

28:25.237 --> 28:29.208
Yeah, I mean, I-I think
it's a personal choice.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.179
What does that mean?
Are you vaccinated, Clyde?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.314
I'm... immunized.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.983
He's not fucking vaccinated!

28:37.083 --> 28:38.250
He's the fucking one!

28:38.350 --> 28:39.518
Hey, I just, I just

28:39.618 --> 28:41.620
need to see the research
first, you know.

28:41.720 --> 28:46.225
It's been 40 years, Clyde.
That's enough research!

28:47.626 --> 28:50.629
Alexa, set an alarm
for 7:00 a.m.

28:52.464 --> 28:56.168
Alexa,
set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.470
Why don't you go talk
to your father?

28:58.570 --> 28:59.671
Goddamn it.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.373
If there's some kind
of connection

29:01.473 --> 29:03.142
with your dad's farm that can
help everyone figure out

29:03.242 --> 29:06.112
what's going on,
then you need to talk to him.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.980
Can I just go to sleep, please?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.949
Oh, poor you!
Poor you!

29:10.049 --> 29:12.484
Stop being a fucking victim.
At least you get to go out

29:12.584 --> 29:15.321
and do stuff.
What do I get to do?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.990
-Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
-Oh, okay, great.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.725
You're sorry, again.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.394
By the way, I can tell you

29:22.494 --> 29:24.696
about some great deals
on headphones at Best Buy.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.298
Would you like to know more?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.801
-Sure, yes, tell me more.
-Okay.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.203
The Mark VII headphones
have a new edition coming out.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.272
Should I add that
to your shopping list?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.541
(sighs) Yes, sure,
add them to my shopping list.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.576
Okay.
I'll add Mark VII headphones

29:37.676 --> 29:40.312
from Best Buy
to your shopping list.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.054
-(Yentl moaning)
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.756
Yeah, you like that?
Yeah! Yeah!

29:50.857 --> 29:52.791
Yeah, you like how Abraham
trusted in the one true God?!

29:52.892 --> 29:56.628
-(moaning continues)
-Yeah! Oh, oh, yeah! Yeah!

29:56.728 --> 29:59.131
Goddamn it!

29:59.231 --> 30:01.300
(moaning)

30:01.400 --> 30:02.902
CARTMAN:
Oh. Shh, shh. Hang on, honey.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.436
Hang on.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.006
Yeah, yeah,
what's up, buddy?

30:07.106 --> 30:09.141
What's up
is that I am over this!

30:09.241 --> 30:10.276
What are, what are
you talking about?

30:10.376 --> 30:11.677
You know what I'm talking about!

30:11.777 --> 30:14.013
You know I can hear you
through the walls!

30:14.113 --> 30:15.647
Okay, geez, I'm sorry.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.649
Sorry I was making love
to my wife.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.085
No Jewish people have sex

30:19.185 --> 30:20.987
screaming about
their love of Abraham!

30:21.087 --> 30:22.955
You are a fucking fraud!

30:23.055 --> 30:24.323
Is everything all right?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.058
Do you know that
your husband once snuck

30:26.158 --> 30:28.360
in my room
and gave me fucking AIDS?!

30:28.460 --> 30:31.330
-I'm sorry?!
-Oh, my God, Kyle!

30:31.430 --> 30:34.400
If we are being too loud, please
don't lash out at my wife!

30:34.500 --> 30:37.236
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I don't know what to say.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.671
Mom, Dad, is everything okay?

30:39.771 --> 30:41.740
It's all right, kids.
Go back to bed.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.710
Kyle, obviously you have
a problem with us being here.

30:44.810 --> 30:48.080
I promise you that we will be
gone first thing in the morning.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.149
That's probably best!

30:57.323 --> 30:59.025
(rhythmic rattling)

30:59.125 --> 31:00.492
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah!

31:00.592 --> 31:02.028
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah, you like how Abraham

31:02.128 --> 31:03.262
-almost sacrificed
his only son?!
-Oh, yeah!

31:03.362 --> 31:04.296
-(moans)
-CARTMAN: Yeah!

31:08.234 --> 31:10.269
Sir! Sir,
the townspeople are demanding

31:10.369 --> 31:12.071
to know when
the quarantine will end.

31:12.171 --> 31:15.174
It'll end when we get the order
that everything is safe.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.444
But, sir, the people inside
are running out of supplies.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.912
They're saying they don't
have nearly enough

31:20.012 --> 31:22.014
chin diapers and
people are starting to fight.

31:22.114 --> 31:26.986
I have strict orders not to let
anything in or out of this town.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.022
They'll just have to make do
the best they can in there.

31:30.122 --> 31:33.425
Hopefully they can
maintain some sense of humanity.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.027
SOLDIER:
We got a runner!

31:35.127 --> 31:36.996
Another one trying to get out!

31:37.096 --> 31:38.364
Please!

31:38.464 --> 31:40.732
I just need to go to
a sporting event!

31:40.832 --> 31:42.468
(gunshot)

31:44.270 --> 31:46.973
(school bell rings)

31:47.073 --> 31:49.341
(busy chatter)

31:50.276 --> 31:52.011
(yawns)

31:52.111 --> 31:54.046
(smacking lips)

31:54.146 --> 31:56.582
(toilet flushes)

32:00.819 --> 32:03.722
Hey, Clyde. Clyde, can we
talk to you for a second?

32:03.822 --> 32:04.923
Sure, what's up?

32:05.024 --> 32:07.994
Look, Clyde,
we all really respect

32:08.094 --> 32:10.562
your personal p-p-preferences.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.699
But we have things we
really need to get back to.

32:13.799 --> 32:16.702
We've got jobs a-and careers,
people who need us.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.704
B-But we're being forced
to stay here.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.807
So could you maybe just--
just get vaccinated real quick?

32:21.907 --> 32:24.276
Oh. Um...

32:24.376 --> 32:26.678
Nah. I don't wanna.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.014
(all groaning)

32:28.114 --> 32:30.516
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
It's for health reasons.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.452
I can't get vaccinated 'cause
I'm allergic to shellfish.

32:33.552 --> 32:37.389
Clyde, there's no shellfish
in the COVID vaccine.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.425
I know,
but I read that sometimes

32:39.525 --> 32:41.327
in the lab where the vaccine
is made,

32:41.427 --> 32:43.195
if somebody ate shellfish,

32:43.295 --> 32:44.696
then it can
get cross-contaminated

32:44.796 --> 32:47.666
and have leftover
residual shellfish-ness.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.436
So you're saying you
won't take the COVID vaccine

32:50.536 --> 32:52.171
out of shellfish-ness.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.605
Yes, that is correct.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.242
Just a general sense
of shellfish-ness.

32:56.342 --> 32:59.011
Everyone, you better
come check this out.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.647
Look at this.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.016
CRAIG:
The McCormick Science Wing

33:04.116 --> 33:06.185
at South Park Elementary.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.254
Yeah, so? I read about this.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.555
Kenny donated tons of money

33:09.655 --> 33:11.290
to build a science center
for the students.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.758
Yeah, for the students.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.826
So why does it
have a lock on it?

33:14.926 --> 33:17.029
* *

33:17.129 --> 33:18.230
(banging)

33:18.330 --> 33:20.566
(chain rattles)

33:26.772 --> 33:29.608
WENDY: This must be where Kenny
was doing all his research.

33:29.708 --> 33:33.212
He didn't want to be found,
so he used the school as cover.

33:33.312 --> 33:37.383
Uh, guys, why is there
blood everywhere?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.219
Everybody see what you can find.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.355
There's got to be a clue here
of who killed Kenny.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.226
(electronic drumbeat playing)

33:47.326 --> 33:49.061
* In the future *

33:49.895 --> 33:52.831
* We are living in the future *

33:53.599 --> 33:54.766
* It's the future. *

33:54.866 --> 33:56.068
(music stops)

33:59.705 --> 34:02.074
MALE VOICE: And we are the
fastest growing retirement home

34:02.174 --> 34:04.843
in Park County.
With our newest tower,

34:04.943 --> 34:08.247
we can now house over
600,000 old people.

34:08.347 --> 34:13.285
'Cause in the future you're old
for a long, long time.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.988
(indistinct chatter, grumbling)

34:17.089 --> 34:20.326
(pained groaning)

34:20.426 --> 34:21.727
Can I help you?

34:21.827 --> 34:25.464
My name is Stan Marsh.
I came to...

34:25.564 --> 34:27.799
visit my dad.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.268
(knocking)

34:29.368 --> 34:32.971
Mr. Marsh.
Mr. Marsh, guess what.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.006
Your son is here.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.877
I don't have a son.

34:38.977 --> 34:43.149
Oh, come on, Mr. Marsh,
don't be a grumpy pants.

34:43.249 --> 34:46.318
You tell that piece of shit
that if he wants to

34:46.418 --> 34:48.787
talk to me,
he can write an email.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.690
Tell that little pussy
if I had any grandkids,

34:51.790 --> 34:53.659
maybe I wouldn't be so bitter

34:53.759 --> 34:56.295
at having such a little bitch
for a son!

34:56.395 --> 34:59.131
-Hi, Dad.
-Oh, hey, Stan.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.567
I'll leave you two alone.

35:06.071 --> 35:09.908
So, looks like
the Broncos still suck.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.377
Yup.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.646
Well, it was nice seeing ya.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.182
Thanks for coming to visit.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.549
I didn't come to visit.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.251
Trust me,
I don't want to be here.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.654
Right, like you didn't
want to murder your sister.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.591
What happened to Shelley
was your fault, not mine!

35:25.691 --> 35:28.660
Yeah, like it was my fault
your mom shot herself!

35:28.760 --> 35:30.696
Yes, it actually was!

35:30.796 --> 35:34.400
Your mom died the day
her daughter burned to death!

35:36.368 --> 35:38.970
I'm just here because of Kenny.

35:39.070 --> 35:42.441
Why would he have
Tegridy Weed in his equations?

35:45.711 --> 35:47.779
Dr. McCormick mentioned Tegridy?

35:47.879 --> 35:51.183
It seemed to somehow fit
into some grand theory he had.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.953
He knew. He knew
it was the way to fix it all.

35:55.053 --> 35:59.958
He knew...
about the Pandemic Special.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.697
But, Mom,
why do we have to leave?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.333
It's not safe outside!

36:07.433 --> 36:08.834
We aren't welcome here,
children.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.836
We have to find another
place to stay.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.871
Oh, no, this is just like
when our people were

36:12.971 --> 36:14.940
exiled from the Holy Lands.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.209
Mrs. Cartman,
can I talk to you, please?

36:17.309 --> 36:19.211
-Uncle Kyle!
-Uncle Kyle,

36:19.311 --> 36:21.480
why are you making us go? Why?

36:21.580 --> 36:23.048
Is it 'cause we're Jews?

36:23.148 --> 36:26.352
Mrs. Cartman,
I'm sorry for last night.

36:26.452 --> 36:31.557
I was just... tired and it was
extremely inappropriate of me.

36:31.657 --> 36:32.591
BOTH:
Dad!

36:32.691 --> 36:33.892
I think Uncle Kyle

36:33.992 --> 36:35.794
is gonna let us stay, Papa!

36:35.894 --> 36:40.432
Uh, no, kids, I'm sorry, but we
can't stay here with Uncle Kyle.

36:40.532 --> 36:44.069
Please stay.
I am asking you to stay.

36:44.169 --> 36:46.472
Can we, Dad?
We'll be good, we promise!

36:46.572 --> 36:48.807
You little ones are always good.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.511
* Mik-helm, Mik-helm,
mit cloiska pudding *

36:52.611 --> 36:54.946
* Vil plotz vit laughter, too *

36:55.046 --> 36:56.081
Stop it!

36:56.181 --> 36:57.249
(doorbell rings)

36:57.349 --> 36:59.585
* Someone is at the door! *

36:59.685 --> 37:03.389
-* Yeah! This is the doorbell! *
-(yells)

37:03.489 --> 37:05.424
* It is the future! *

37:05.524 --> 37:07.393
They killed Kenny...

37:07.493 --> 37:09.561
because he was
trying to stop it.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.430
Stop what?

37:11.530 --> 37:12.964
We found Kenny's lab.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.034
All of his confidential work
and his wild experiments.

37:16.134 --> 37:19.805
Kenny wasn't just trying to find
the source of the coronavirus.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.840
He was trying
to go back in time,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.443
and stop the pandemic
from ever happening.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.878
* *

37:26.978 --> 37:30.215
(woman speaking Japanese)

37:30.316 --> 37:32.117
Okay, old people.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.453
It's 4:00.
You know what that means.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.322
It's share time!

37:36.422 --> 37:37.989
(all grumbling)

37:38.089 --> 37:40.191
Who has something that they
want to share?

37:40.292 --> 37:41.493
Mr. Garrison?

37:41.593 --> 37:44.496
I'd like to share
my dick in your mouth.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.699
-(laughter)
-M'kay.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.001
Okay, guys, let's settle down.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.505
Look, I know sharing feelings is
hard during this time of crisis.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.642
Is anyone feeling nervous
about the new COVID outbreak?

37:56.742 --> 37:58.710
(grumbling)

37:58.810 --> 38:01.079
We don't want you to worry,
because, you know,

38:01.179 --> 38:03.515
it's the future--
we all do everything we can

38:03.615 --> 38:05.517
to make sure
old people don't die.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.085
(all groaning)

38:07.185 --> 38:09.154
Okay, if nobody else
wants to go first,

38:09.254 --> 38:11.122
Randy Marsh had
a little visitor today

38:11.222 --> 38:13.692
and he'd like to share that
with all of you.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.863
Uh, hey, everyone. I had
a special visitor today.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.498
My "son."

38:19.598 --> 38:22.233
Who hasn't come to see me
in over 20 years.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.570
And I have some things
I need to tell him

38:24.670 --> 38:26.505
but it's hard because...

38:26.605 --> 38:28.039
he killed his mom
and his sister.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.509
Okay, okay,
here's what happened.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.943
Oh, here we go, here we go.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.413
After the pandemic,
my mom wanted a divorce

38:34.513 --> 38:36.214
and she owned half of the farm.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.717
She didn't own half,
she always hated weed,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.285
and she didn't do shit
for the farm.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.888
He wouldn't give her half
the farm, so I got sick

38:42.988 --> 38:44.222
of their fighting
and decided to burn

38:44.322 --> 38:46.057
the whole stupid farm
to the ground.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.827
And his sister was in the barn
and she burned to death.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.062
Because you locked her
in the barn 'cause she wouldn't

38:51.162 --> 38:53.799
do her weed chores
'cause she hated weed, too!

38:53.899 --> 38:56.001
Yes, she had
a marijuana problem.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.537
And so his mother
couldn't take the loss

38:58.637 --> 39:00.572
of Shelley
and so she killed herself!

39:00.672 --> 39:02.273
Which is your fault.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.642
You were the one who

39:03.742 --> 39:04.876
burned the family business
to the ground.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.378
You guys are hearing this,
right?

39:08.447 --> 39:12.283
So, Kenny spends years
researching time travel,

39:12.384 --> 39:14.185
then suddenly Kenny dies,

39:14.285 --> 39:16.655
and all his fellow
scientists go missing.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.391
Just leaving behind
a trail of blood.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.727
Seems like all of
the scientists were murdered

39:21.827 --> 39:24.262
so that nobody could
complete Kenny's work.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.764
All of them except one.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.666
In almost all this research,

39:27.766 --> 39:31.302
one name keeps popping up:
Victor Chouce.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.473
It appears that Chouce
was Kenny's right-hand man.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.141
But he was insane.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.276
He's been locked up for years
inside a mental institution.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.612
Oh, come on.
Now we're gonna start talking

39:40.712 --> 39:42.280
to certifiably crazy people?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.283
Crazy or not,
we find this Victor Chouce

39:45.383 --> 39:48.286
and we find where
Kenny hid the information.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.422
* *

39:52.190 --> 39:54.426
(crazed chatter and wailing)

39:56.027 --> 39:57.496
WARDEN (echoes):
Yes.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.197
Yes, that is correct.

39:59.297 --> 40:02.200
Victor Chouce is
one of our patients here.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.770
What is the nature
of your inquiry?

40:04.870 --> 40:07.439
We have reason to believe
that Victor Chouce

40:07.539 --> 40:10.341
can answer questions
regarding our friend's death.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.377
Could you put him
on the line please?

40:12.478 --> 40:14.646
I'm afraid that's impossible.

40:14.746 --> 40:19.017
Victor is too unstable for
phone calls. They confuse him.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.087
Well, can we come
talk to him in person then?

40:23.154 --> 40:25.691
Yes, I believe
that could be arranged.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.727
As long as
the proper protocols are met.

40:28.827 --> 40:32.030
Is everyone
in your party vaccinated?

40:33.599 --> 40:34.866
No.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.935
Well, then
I'm afraid we can't allow you

40:37.035 --> 40:38.436
into our facility.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.640
But-but we have to talk to him!
It's urgent!

40:41.740 --> 40:42.908
What'd they say?

40:43.008 --> 40:44.309
They're not
gonna let us see him!

40:44.409 --> 40:47.112
It's some kind of
goddamn conspiracy!

40:48.580 --> 40:52.317
(woman speaking Japanese)

40:57.055 --> 40:58.890
Listen to me, it's very simple.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.326
I need to take my dad
out of here.

41:01.426 --> 41:02.561
He has to come with me.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.429
I'm afraid that's impossible.

41:04.530 --> 41:07.098
Senior citizens are
in here to keep them safe.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.802
You know, it's the future--
we can't let old people die.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.338
-I told you, stupid.
-Shut up, Dad.

41:13.438 --> 41:16.274
Look, there's a chance we
can help fight this new variant.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.243
I just need him out for
a couple hours

41:18.343 --> 41:19.745
so we can
get something important.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.312
Well, why don't you
just go get it?

41:21.412 --> 41:23.582
Because he won't tell me
where it is because

41:23.682 --> 41:26.384
-he doesn't trust me.
-Because he killed his mom.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.320
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is the future.

41:29.420 --> 41:32.257
Nothing is more important than
keeping old people alive.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.925
What if you took him out there
and, God forbid,

41:34.025 --> 41:35.360
he crapped his pants?

41:35.460 --> 41:36.895
And then slipped on
the old people diarrhea

41:36.995 --> 41:38.296
and hit his head?

41:38.396 --> 41:39.631
We'd have to shut down
the entire country,

41:39.731 --> 41:40.699
for Christ's sake.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.668
Well, I guess that's it.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.236
Only one way out now.

41:48.574 --> 41:49.975
Kick him in the balls, Stan!

41:50.075 --> 41:51.442
-What?!
-Kick him in the balls!

41:51.543 --> 41:53.779
-Come on, hurry!
-Get your hands off of me!

41:53.879 --> 41:55.413
-Dad!
-Goddamn it, Stan,

41:55.513 --> 41:58.416
kick his fucking balls
so we can go!

41:58.516 --> 41:59.951
-Fuck!
-(groans)

42:00.051 --> 42:03.955
Okay, grab his keys!
Grab his keys, you stupid ass!

42:05.023 --> 42:07.693
(coughing and groaning)

42:07.793 --> 42:09.260
(alert beeping)

42:09.360 --> 42:12.430
FEMALE VOICE: Warning. Warning.
Old person has escaped.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.667
Old person has escaped.
Warning.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.503
(woman speaking Japanese)

42:18.604 --> 42:20.371
(alarm blaring)

42:22.540 --> 42:25.110
(sirens wailing)

42:25.210 --> 42:26.978
All of these documents
we found in Kenny's lab

42:27.078 --> 42:29.815
referred to possible origins
of the coronavirus.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.750
He wanted to go back
and stop it.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.686
But to stop it, he had to
figure out how to bend time.

42:34.786 --> 42:38.657
Exactly. There's notes--
years and years of research

42:38.757 --> 42:40.058
that Kenny compiled--

42:40.158 --> 42:42.227
all on the possibilities
of time travel.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.295
CARTMAN (giggling):
You silly girl.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.165
You, yes.
Who's a little mister, yes.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.700
Who's a little hetzpah?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.301
Who's my little meshugana?

42:50.401 --> 42:51.837
Excuse me!

42:51.937 --> 42:53.438
Geez, sorry, Kyle.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.841
Kenny was researching
the nature of space-time

42:55.941 --> 42:58.076
to see if some kind
of bending was possible.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.079
But then suddenly, all
the research just gets cut off.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.048
Because whoever
made the pandemic happen

43:03.148 --> 43:05.316
killed Kenny before
he could go back and stop it.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.686
CARTMAN (giggling):
Silly girl. Yes.

43:07.786 --> 43:09.888
Will you please knock it off?!

43:09.988 --> 43:11.489
What's the problem, Kyle?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.424
You know what you're doing,
fat-ass!

43:13.524 --> 43:16.194
Goddamn it, why don't you lay
off my fuckin' dad, Uncle Kyle!

43:16.294 --> 43:18.930
Moisha! He's never
talked like that before.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.231
I'm sorry, Mom. It's just...

43:20.331 --> 43:22.600
Uncle Kyle,
he makes me so crazy!

43:22.701 --> 43:24.469
That is not okay, Moisha.

43:24.569 --> 43:28.273
But it's true, Dad.
Uncle Kyle makes me crazy, too!

43:28.373 --> 43:30.709
-(scoffs) Menorah!
-Fuck you, Kyle.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.778
(gasps) Hackelm!

43:32.878 --> 43:34.746
You guys, listen.
In Kenny's work

43:34.846 --> 43:37.448
he talks about where he would
hide important information.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.885
He says his friends
will always know where to look

43:39.985 --> 43:42.620
if they just
think like kids again.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.657
Think like kids again...

43:46.725 --> 43:49.527
I know where Kenny hid
what we're looking for.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.897
It's up his ass.

43:57.535 --> 43:59.037
Who's the broad?

43:59.137 --> 44:01.239
That's just my Alexa.

44:02.107 --> 44:03.608
That's the best
you could do, huh?

44:03.709 --> 44:04.910
Is it even the new one?

44:05.010 --> 44:07.445
-Excuse me?
-Just ignore him.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.348
Okay, fine, there's a new
upgrade available

44:10.448 --> 44:11.983
for your Amazon Prime
membership.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.451
Would you like to know more?

44:13.551 --> 44:14.886
Not now, please.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.655
Okay, so I guess
just fuck me, then?

44:19.424 --> 44:21.326
Uh-huh.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.431
(car beeps)

44:30.902 --> 44:33.138
* *

44:37.608 --> 44:40.245
This was once
such a magical place.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.080
Can we just get this over with?

44:42.180 --> 44:43.648
I don't want to be here.

44:43.749 --> 44:45.250
You think I want to be here?

44:45.350 --> 44:48.319
This is where I lost
everything that I cared about!

44:48.419 --> 44:50.488
And your mom and your sister!

44:56.995 --> 44:59.030
Dad, there's nothing here.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.199
Dad?

45:01.299 --> 45:02.934
I think I can
trust you now, Stan.

45:03.034 --> 45:06.838
It's time for you to learn what
your friend Kenny was after.

45:06.938 --> 45:10.208
When the pandemic started,
you were only a kid.

45:10.308 --> 45:13.644
You don't remember the pain
we all went through.

45:13.745 --> 45:14.980
Yeah, I do.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.883
We as Americans
went through so much.

45:17.983 --> 45:22.220
First, that incompetent
jack-hole was elected president.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.723
Then the pandemic came,
and then the race wars.

45:25.824 --> 45:29.795
And then just when it seemed
like we'd turned a corner,

45:29.895 --> 45:35.200
Space Jam 2 came out,
and we all just kind of gave up.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.703
What we lost,
Stan, was our Tegridy.

45:38.804 --> 45:40.906
But it was all by design.

45:41.006 --> 45:42.974
They needed us to lose it.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.242
Who did?

45:44.342 --> 45:46.878
Who would want us
to lose our optimism

45:46.978 --> 45:49.314
and start fighting
with each other?

45:49.414 --> 45:50.215
China.

45:50.315 --> 45:53.251
-China?
-China.

45:53.351 --> 45:55.486
They're the superpower now.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.456
The future is totally theirs
and we let it happen.

45:58.556 --> 46:01.092
A man in China
had sex with a pangolin

46:01.192 --> 46:04.062
and that started COVID.
That man was me.

46:04.162 --> 46:05.596
So I knew how to go back

46:05.696 --> 46:07.098
and stop them
from taking over...

46:07.198 --> 46:08.800
Wait, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.501
You started COVID?

46:10.601 --> 46:12.503
Yes, but that's
besides the point.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.840
China used me
like they used us all.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.909
So I came up with a way
to help everyone fight back.

46:18.009 --> 46:20.311
A special Tegridy weed.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.747
You had sex with a pangolin

46:22.848 --> 46:25.683
in China and started
the whole pandemic?!

46:25.783 --> 46:27.919
Will you listen
to what I'm saying?!

46:28.019 --> 46:30.721
Gal!
I worked to create more Tegridy,

46:30.822 --> 46:33.591
but China did everything
they could to stop me.

46:33.691 --> 46:35.326
They even got to my son.

46:35.426 --> 46:38.329
Who burned all of
Tegridy Farms to the ground.

46:38.429 --> 46:40.665
But what you didn't even know

46:40.765 --> 46:44.069
was that I had secretly
created a new strain of weed.

46:44.169 --> 46:48.173
A weed so powerful, I couldn't
even call it a special.

46:48.273 --> 46:50.375
It was more like an event.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.011
I hid it away all these years.

46:53.111 --> 46:57.715
And now it... is the key
to saving us all.

47:00.585 --> 47:02.453
(whirring)

47:07.358 --> 47:09.327
-Where the fuck is it?
-What?

47:09.427 --> 47:12.597
The Tegridy Weed Special Event!
Where the fuck is it?!

47:12.697 --> 47:14.165
I don't know, Dad!

47:14.265 --> 47:16.601
They got it. They took it!

47:16.701 --> 47:18.536
There's even fresh
footprints on the ground!

47:18.636 --> 47:20.138
Oh, Jesus!

47:20.238 --> 47:22.273
So maybe it wasn't the Chinese.

47:22.373 --> 47:26.377
Yeah, no, it was definitely
the Chinese. Oh, God.

47:26.477 --> 47:30.048
That was it! That was
the very last bit of Tegridy!

47:30.148 --> 47:32.984
The only other thing I had
were some seeds that I hid

47:33.084 --> 47:36.922
up my ass, but they took them
from me at the old folks home!

47:37.022 --> 47:38.990
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

47:39.090 --> 47:42.093
I said they took them from me
at the old folks home.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.294
No, before that.

47:43.394 --> 47:46.764
Oh. I said I hid 'em
up my ass.

47:46.864 --> 47:51.002
Jesus. It's so simple.
How did we not get it?

47:51.102 --> 47:53.138
Alexa, start the car!

47:54.072 --> 47:56.307
There's no point now, son!

47:56.407 --> 47:58.209
It's all gone.

47:58.309 --> 48:01.512
It's all lost. All lost.

48:01.612 --> 48:04.749
VOICE (whispering):
Randy.

48:04.849 --> 48:07.785
Randy.

48:07.885 --> 48:10.021
Ah...?

48:10.121 --> 48:12.590
MAN (over P.A.):
ICU, please. Blue Team, ICU.

48:14.459 --> 48:17.228
(indistinct chatter)

48:18.729 --> 48:20.698
"Un-cle Kyle."

48:22.200 --> 48:25.803
"Uncle Kyle."
Say it, Hackelm.

48:27.072 --> 48:31.109
-"Uncle Kyle."
-Fuck you, Kyle.

48:31.209 --> 48:34.812
No, no, no.
"Uncle Kyle."

48:34.912 --> 48:36.181
Fuck you, Kyle.

48:36.281 --> 48:38.283
CARTMAN:
Oh, my gosh, no.

48:38.383 --> 48:40.318
We're so sorry about this.

48:40.418 --> 48:43.121
CARTMAN:
Hackelm, say "Uncle."

48:43.221 --> 48:47.792
"Uncle. Uncle Kyle."

48:48.859 --> 48:50.761
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

48:50.861 --> 48:52.163
Hey, that was better.

48:52.263 --> 48:54.099
It isn't gonna work.
The hospital says

48:54.199 --> 48:56.134
we don't have authorization
to see Kenny's remains.

48:56.234 --> 48:57.435
What?!

48:57.535 --> 48:59.070
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us

48:59.170 --> 49:01.539
to see Kenny's remains.
'Cause we might find the truth.

49:01.639 --> 49:03.474
There has to be
a way for us to get in there.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.843
-Ha ha. Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!
-Hackelm.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.179
STAN: What the hell
are you guys doing here?

49:08.846 --> 49:10.948
-Stan?
-What are you doing here?

49:11.049 --> 49:13.451
I've been trying to
find out who killed Kenny.

49:13.551 --> 49:16.054
I think I know where he
stored the information.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.255
BOTH:
It's in his asshole.

49:17.355 --> 49:18.689
-Yes.
-Well, it doesn't matter.

49:18.789 --> 49:20.291
They won't let us
into the morgue.

49:20.391 --> 49:22.027
Yeah, that's because
you guys don't think.

49:22.127 --> 49:23.394
Excuse me?
We need to examine

49:23.494 --> 49:25.430
the remains of Dr. McCormick
right away.

49:25.530 --> 49:27.065
Like I told the others,

49:27.165 --> 49:30.001
only certified medical personnel
are allowed to examine cadavers.

49:30.101 --> 49:31.702
Stan Marsh, consultant

49:31.802 --> 49:34.639
for Post-Modem Beveragetainment
Online Services.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.875
One moment, Doctor.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.677
This is highly unorthodox.

49:39.777 --> 49:42.147
We don't normally allow
outsiders into the morgue.

49:42.247 --> 49:46.251
That's understandable, Doctor,
but luckily I am orthodox.

49:46.351 --> 49:48.386
I don't think this
is suitable for children.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.721
You guys go.
You were the closest to him.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.857
We'll stay back
and watch the kids.

49:54.859 --> 49:56.627
I'm sorry we can't
supply any chin diapers.

49:56.727 --> 49:58.629
Just maintain social distance.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.398
Middle cabinet,
second from the bottom.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.733
* *

50:17.448 --> 50:19.117
Hello, old friend.

50:19.217 --> 50:20.851
(rats squeaking)

50:20.951 --> 50:22.420
Ah, come on!

50:25.423 --> 50:27.292
Well, let's get him...

50:27.392 --> 50:28.759
turned over.

50:33.464 --> 50:34.732
Somebody's got to look.

50:34.832 --> 50:36.501
I'm not reaching up Kenny's ass.

50:36.601 --> 50:38.035
Well, somebody has to.

50:38.136 --> 50:39.604
-Cartman, go ahead.
-No, I can't do it.

50:39.704 --> 50:40.938
If anyone should reach up
Kenny's ass,

50:41.038 --> 50:42.373
it should be you, Kyle.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.109
I thought you were
his fucking "best friend."

50:44.209 --> 50:47.078
I was his best friend,
but I am also married,

50:47.178 --> 50:49.514
so I can't be fingering
people's buttholes.

50:49.614 --> 50:51.949
God, you guys fucking suck.
I'll just do it.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.219
Just like I always had to
fix fucking everything else!

50:54.319 --> 50:56.421
(rats squeaking)

50:57.255 --> 50:58.689
(squishing)

51:00.057 --> 51:01.992
You did not
"fucking fix everything,"

51:02.093 --> 51:04.829
you just started acting like
everyone else was stupid.

51:04.929 --> 51:07.765
Oh, really? Because
they were acting stupid?

51:07.865 --> 51:10.168
Yeah, because you got all
self-righteous about everything.

51:10.268 --> 51:12.603
-I got self-righteous?
-Yeah, you got self-righteous.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.639
Do you know what
fucking sanctimonious means?

51:14.739 --> 51:16.641
No, Kyle, why don't you
fucking tell me

51:16.741 --> 51:18.343
what fucking
sanctimonious means.

51:18.443 --> 51:19.844
See, this is exactly
how you acted when

51:19.944 --> 51:21.612
-the pandemic started to...
-Wait!

51:21.712 --> 51:22.680
Hold on.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.116
-(squishing)
-We've got it.

51:29.354 --> 51:30.821
-Oh, my God.
-What?

51:30.921 --> 51:34.091
It's got shit on it.
That's dead people shit.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.362
(retches)

51:39.964 --> 51:41.566
What are you working on, Clyde?

51:41.666 --> 51:43.568
I'm going through
Kenny's journals again

51:43.668 --> 51:45.136
to try to find some answers.

51:45.236 --> 51:47.938
Seems like we just keep hitting
dead ends, you know?

51:48.038 --> 51:50.241
I'm just tired
and I want to go home.

51:50.341 --> 51:52.843
I know. I'm exhausted, too.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.249
You want to maybe
do a little bump?

51:58.349 --> 51:59.484
Huh?

51:59.584 --> 52:00.851
I was just--

52:00.951 --> 52:03.454
I've got some coke
and I thought we could...

52:03.554 --> 52:05.723
I don't know,
do you want to party?

52:06.657 --> 52:08.259
Fuck yes, I want to party.

52:08.359 --> 52:09.760
-Really?
-Fuck yes.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.662
Oh, I'm so glad you're down.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.731
Nobody else is even cool enough
for me to ask.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.466
It's pretty good shit, too.

52:15.566 --> 52:18.603
(sniffing)
Oh, man. Thank God.

52:18.703 --> 52:19.870
Thank God I brought this.
Here ya go.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.673
Fuck yes.
Let's fucking party.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.109
Wait a minute.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.279
-What is this really?
-What do you mean?

52:28.379 --> 52:31.516
This isn't cocaine, it's
the COVID vaccine, isn't it?!

52:31.616 --> 52:34.151
I'm not putting
that shit in my body!

52:34.252 --> 52:35.886
Forget it, guys, it didn't work.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.355
(all groaning)

52:37.455 --> 52:40.124
You guys were gonna trick me
into taking the vaccine?!

52:40.225 --> 52:42.327
Goddamn it, Clyde,
we want to get out of here!

52:42.427 --> 52:45.563
My body is a temple
and I'm not taking that shit!

52:45.663 --> 52:47.798
Let's just face it, guys,
it's over.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.134
We're never going to find
what Kenny was after.

52:50.235 --> 52:52.437
Whoever controls the world
and killed our friend

52:52.537 --> 52:54.104
is just gonna get away with it.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.706
KYLE:
Not so fast!

52:57.942 --> 53:01.312
We did it! We found Kenny's
hidden information!

53:01.412 --> 53:03.248
-You did?
-And now we can finally

53:03.348 --> 53:04.249
learn the truth!

53:04.349 --> 53:05.650
Whoever Kenny was after,

53:05.750 --> 53:08.219
we are gonna
take those fuckers down!

53:08.319 --> 53:09.587
(beeps)

53:09.687 --> 53:11.556
(static crackles)

53:11.656 --> 53:15.860
The date is November 3rd.
It is 2:07 p.m.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.296
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be

53:18.396 --> 53:20.331
attempting to travel back
in time.

53:20.431 --> 53:24.469
In order to stop the COVID
pandemic from ever happening.

53:25.270 --> 53:26.170
He did it?

53:26.271 --> 53:27.638
Dr. McCormick believes

53:27.738 --> 53:28.639
that going back

53:28.739 --> 53:30.107
is the only way

53:30.207 --> 53:32.810
to stop the people
who have ruined the future.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.413
In the event of
Dr. McCormick's death,

53:35.513 --> 53:37.315
he wants everyone
to know the group

53:37.415 --> 53:39.784
that is responsible
for the way things are.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.487
It is,
"My three dickhead friends,

53:42.587 --> 53:44.989
Stan, Kyle and Cartman."

53:45.990 --> 53:46.724
What?!

53:46.824 --> 53:48.526
Dr. McCormick says

53:48.626 --> 53:50.728
that these three
completely ruined everything

53:50.828 --> 53:53.097
when they let COVID
break up their friendship

53:53.197 --> 53:56.401
and became argumentative,
combative, pessimistic assholes.

53:56.501 --> 53:59.003
(muffled muttering)

53:59.103 --> 54:01.005
He says he hopes
you guys are watching this.

54:01.105 --> 54:05.009
(muffled shouting)

54:05.910 --> 54:08.212
He spent his whole life
trying to fix your broship

54:08.313 --> 54:10.214
and then realized
this was the only way,

54:10.315 --> 54:11.682
'cause you guys suck.

54:11.782 --> 54:14.385
-(loud zapping)
-The sequence is active!

54:14.485 --> 54:16.554
The historic moment is here!

54:16.654 --> 54:18.356
Godspeed, Dr. McCormick!

54:18.456 --> 54:19.857
(zapping continues)

54:19.957 --> 54:23.160
Wait! Dr. McCormick,
you forgot your chin diaper!

54:23.260 --> 54:24.395
(alarm blaring)

54:24.495 --> 54:26.030
Something's wrong!

54:26.130 --> 54:28.633
-(explosions)
-(electronic trilling)

54:29.400 --> 54:31.302
(shouting)

54:48.386 --> 54:51.021
(coughing)

54:53.424 --> 54:56.160
All this time,
the bad guys we were after,

54:56.260 --> 55:00.865
who Kenny said ruined
the future, was you guys?

55:00.965 --> 55:03.167
Wendy, I've been trying
not to say anything but...

55:03.267 --> 55:06.170
your friends are all
kind of douchebags.

55:08.072 --> 55:10.107
* *

55:10.207 --> 55:11.509
Kenny was right.

55:11.609 --> 55:13.678
All this time,
we've been trying to figure out

55:13.778 --> 55:16.347
whose fault this all was.

55:16.447 --> 55:18.282
It was our fault.

55:18.383 --> 55:20.518
I remember when we were kids.

55:20.618 --> 55:23.087
We were so optimistic.

55:23.187 --> 55:26.857
We lost that.
We lost our sense of fun.

55:26.957 --> 55:29.226
Our sense of humor.

55:29.326 --> 55:32.229
Maybe the pandemic
was a big test.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.765
And we all failed.

55:34.865 --> 55:37.301
Let's face it, guys.

55:37.402 --> 55:39.336
We killed Kenny.

55:42.607 --> 55:44.141
Yeah. Kenny was right.

55:44.241 --> 55:46.911
Back in the old days,
we wouldn't give up like this.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.813
We would have just set out
to save our friend,

55:48.913 --> 55:50.881
no matter how impossible
it seemed.

55:50.981 --> 55:52.850
What we would have done--

55:52.950 --> 55:54.485
and what we
should have done then--

55:54.585 --> 55:56.387
was double down on our respect

55:56.487 --> 55:59.156
and our love for one another
and fight through it

55:59.256 --> 56:01.592
instead of
fighting with each other.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.327
We can save Kenny.

56:03.428 --> 56:05.062
We just have to finish his work.

56:05.162 --> 56:07.665
How? We don't know anything
about quantum physics

56:07.765 --> 56:09.266
and time travel.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.837
I don't know how.
But we start by believing.

56:12.937 --> 56:15.773
In each other
and in what is yet to come.

56:15.873 --> 56:19.309
We have to go back to being
those kids we once were.

56:19.410 --> 56:22.880
Even if it means
calling Jesus or Santa.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.715
Come on, guys,
we've got work to do!

56:24.815 --> 56:27.652
Sounds good.
I'll be right back.

56:29.654 --> 56:31.388
Moisha, Hackelm, kids,
get your things.

56:31.489 --> 56:32.490
We need to go now.

56:32.590 --> 56:33.958
What's going on, Dad?

56:34.058 --> 56:36.160
Your Uncle Kyle wants to
go back and change things.

56:36.260 --> 56:38.596
He's going to try
and change the past.

56:38.696 --> 56:41.198
But I like things
the way they are.

56:41.298 --> 56:44.168
Me too, Dad. Do you think
he'll be able to do it?

56:44.268 --> 56:45.736
No, kids.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.572
Fuck Uncle Kyle.

56:47.672 --> 56:48.706
BOTH:
Yay!

56:48.806 --> 56:50.808
-Yay, Daddy!
-Fuck Uncle Kyle!

56:54.679 --> 56:56.914
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

56:57.014 --> 57:00.084
People were supposed to
get kinder in the future.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.554
I'm so sorry
what happened to both of you.

57:03.654 --> 57:06.390
It wasn't your fault, Randy.

57:06.491 --> 57:08.759
It was all Stan's fault.

57:08.859 --> 57:12.396
Yes, it was all Stan's fault.

57:13.197 --> 57:15.332
Thanks for saying that,
you guys.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.868
I'm sorry Stan
sucks so hard sometimes.

57:17.968 --> 57:20.270
Don't give up, Randy.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.239
Humanity needs you.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.941
No!

57:24.041 --> 57:26.176
I can't do it alone!

57:26.276 --> 57:29.747
How can things possibly go
back to the way they were?

57:29.847 --> 57:32.082
(wind gusting)

57:42.760 --> 57:44.361
It can't be.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.830
It's impossible.

57:48.165 --> 57:52.436
It's the last little
sprout of Tegridy.

57:58.442 --> 58:00.611
I have to get you
somewhere safe.

58:00.711 --> 58:03.047
We have a lot of work to do.

58:03.814 --> 58:06.050
* *

58:10.588 --> 58:12.823
(footsteps echoing)

58:16.661 --> 58:19.196
(people wailing)

58:19.296 --> 58:22.299
(crazed laughter)

58:23.934 --> 58:28.072
We just had another call asking
to speak with Victor Chouce.

58:28.172 --> 58:31.008
You're quite a popular man,
Victor.

58:34.444 --> 58:37.114
I wonder what
all the fuss is about.

58:40.117 --> 58:43.788
Don't feel like talking, huh?
(chuckles)

58:43.888 --> 58:46.123
You will.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.328
* We are all, you and me *

58:51.428 --> 58:55.132
* We are all living
in the future *

58:55.232 --> 58:57.568
* We can't get stuff
'cause boats are late *

58:57.668 --> 59:01.872
* And nobody's working
in the future *

59:03.841 --> 59:08.145
* They don't sell tostadas
anymore at Taco Bell *

59:08.245 --> 59:10.380
* Welcome to the future *

59:11.315 --> 59:12.917
* In the future *

59:14.318 --> 59:16.854
* We are living in the future *

59:17.955 --> 59:20.090
* It's the future *

59:21.058 --> 59:23.260
* We're living in the future. *
