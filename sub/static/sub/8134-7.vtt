♪♪

00:05.106 --> 00:06.138
[Alec] <i> Previously</i>
<i> on </i> Shadowhunters...

00:06.139 --> 00:07.171
Was he bitten
by an alpha?
Yeah.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.674
[growls]
[Clary] Oh, my God.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.342
Have you spoken
to Jace yet?
He can call me

00:10.344 --> 00:11.710
when he's done
chasing the little girl.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
Stir.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.214
We can't have that girl
out of Institute control.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.682
The entire Shadow World
is looking for her.

00:16.684 --> 00:20.252
You do not get to talk
about Alec, mundane.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.890
I've closed myself off
to feeling anything
for anyone.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.759
You've unlocked
something in me.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.094
I'm always gonna
have your back.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.965
I know where my
mother hid the Cup.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.373
I know where the Cup is.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.076
[Jace] Come again?
The tarot cards.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.911
My mom, she must have
painted them years ago,

00:45.913 --> 00:49.248
but the Mortal Cup
has to be hidden
inside the Ace of Cups.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.783
The card looks
exactly like it.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.753
Wait, why aren't you guys
happy about this?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.955
All we have
to do is find...

00:57.758 --> 00:59.742
Dot.

00:59.743 --> 01:01.727
If Dot had the cards
when she was taken,
we don't have much time.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.062
If Valentine gets
his hands on the Cup--

01:03.064 --> 01:04.496
We know.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.398
If Valentine started
creating Shadowhunters

01:06.400 --> 01:08.984
or gained control
of demons,

01:08.985 --> 01:11.569
it'd be like Beyonce
riding on a dinosaur
through Times Square.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.771
People would notice.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.506
But he can control demons.
I've seen it.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.241
Mmm, paying off
a few demons is easy,

01:16.243 --> 01:19.378
especially since they
rarely survive
long enough to collect.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.013
Still waiting
on Valentine's
thank-you card.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.250
Opening the gates of hell...
that's a little more tricky.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.586
Valentine doesn't
have the cards.

01:29.857 --> 01:30.923
I do.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.258
They're in my desk
back at the precinct.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.411
When Clary went missing,

01:35.412 --> 01:36.628
I went to the loft
and I cleared
everything out,

01:36.630 --> 01:37.863
'cause I didn't want
the Circle to track her.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.198
That's great.
This should be easy.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.300
Hmm, that's what
General Custer said.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.569
Magnus is right.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.538
Valentine has
spies everywhere,
even in the NYPD.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.607
We have to be discreet.
Discreet?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.242
You look like something
out of <i> The Mummy </i> movie.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.643
[Magnus titters]

01:51.645 --> 01:53.145
[Luke] We'll go
in the morning.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.047
Werewolf healing, remember?

01:55.049 --> 01:57.850
This is nothing
a couple of hours
of beauty sleep can't fix.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.882
Hi.

02:31.018 --> 02:34.486
Okay, who are you
and what did
you do with Simon?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.456
[chuckles] Simon?
Never heard of him.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.226
I'm serious.
I've never seen this
side of you before.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.629
First, you're acting
really weird,

02:43.631 --> 02:44.997
you're disappearing
for days on end.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.131
Now, this.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.833
I mean, I've always
thought you were cute,

02:47.835 --> 02:50.369
but last night you were...

02:50.371 --> 02:51.970
[chuckles] I don't know.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.205
[inhales]

02:53.207 --> 02:54.506
You were amazing.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.176
Like, <i> Fifty Shades</i>
of amazing?

02:57.178 --> 02:59.511
Like, Pon farr amazing.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.879
[both chuckle]

03:00.881 --> 03:03.282
I love it when
you speak Vulcan.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.251
[sighs]

03:09.123 --> 03:11.089
Holy crap.
Simon...

03:12.059 --> 03:13.192
can I ask you something?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.727
Uh... sure.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.896
About us.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.700
[exhales] Us?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.569
[chuckling] Yeah, you know.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.573
You and me... us.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.979
You seriously have no idea
where I'm going with this.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.681
[stammers]

03:35.683 --> 03:38.217
Honestly, I'm... I'm a little
confused right now.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.518
[chuckles]

03:39.520 --> 03:41.653
But, um... in a good way.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.956
Simon...

03:44.825 --> 03:46.992
when are you gonna ask me
to be your girlfriend?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.126
Uh...

03:48.929 --> 03:50.229
[sighs] Clary...

03:51.565 --> 03:53.899
[Maureen] Excuse me?
Clary?

03:55.269 --> 03:56.335
Um...

03:59.707 --> 04:01.540
Uh, yeah, just, uh...

04:01.542 --> 04:03.575
I... I forgot something.
I forgot, I...

04:03.577 --> 04:05.844
Was it my name?
Because it's Maureen.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.679
No. No. It's, uh...

04:07.681 --> 04:09.748
I... I forgot
to turn the oven off
at my mom's.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.383
Simon, you don't even cook.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.286
Right, which is exactly
why I probably left it on.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.355
So I should...
I should fix that, right?

04:16.357 --> 04:18.257
I'm not interested
in just hooking up.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.092
Maureen--
So if you're still
stuck on Clary, then--

04:20.094 --> 04:21.627
Clary's seeing someone else.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.162
[stammers] Look...

04:25.699 --> 04:28.100
You're more
than just a hookup.
[stutters] I promise.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.768
I promise.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.470
Okay? It's just that I've...

04:32.273 --> 04:33.538
[sighs]

04:35.442 --> 04:37.376
[door opens and closes]

04:38.912 --> 04:40.479
[siren wailing]

04:45.152 --> 04:47.419
All right,
cards are on my desk.
It shouldn't take long.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.887
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.790
It'll be easier to avoid
unnecessary attention
if I do this alone.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.191
We'll wait here.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.529
It sounded
boring anyway.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.668
Hey.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.679
Stop right where you are.
Don't touch anything.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.781
Detective Garroway,
I need your
badge and your gun.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.316
Who's this?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.825
His name is Fisk.
Internal affairs.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.494
My hands are tied.
You're gonna
have to cooperate.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.264
Have ballistics run
it through the system,
see what pops up.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.734
You're coming with me.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.502
Let's go.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.737
[Luke sighs]

05:50.217 --> 05:51.850
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.952
What is taking him so long?

05:53.954 --> 05:56.021
I know a way we
could find out.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.023
Just go in and
see for ourselves.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.292
Luke told us to stay put,
so that's what
we're gonna do.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.693
[cell phone ringing]

06:01.695 --> 06:03.862
That's probably him now.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.364
I doubt it.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.200
[phone beeps]

06:08.202 --> 06:09.534
Just so I'm clear,
he did mention

06:09.536 --> 06:12.537
something about trying
to avoid attention, right?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.873
From the looks of it,
he's doing
a terrible job.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.941
Circle members?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.316
No, mundanes.
Internal affairs officers.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.550
You can tell all that
just by looking at them?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.452
I can tell all that
by reading their badges.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.459
Better than binoculars.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.661
Luke had his chance.
Yeah.

06:36.663 --> 06:37.996
Let's go.
Okay.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.657
Alec?

07:10.264 --> 07:11.496
Alec!

07:12.900 --> 07:13.965
Is everything okay?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.001
Better than ever.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.071
Is there something
you want to talk about?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.007
No. All good.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.776
Have you seen Alec?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.045
Um, no. Why?
He's supposed to fill out

07:27.047 --> 07:29.848
the incident reports
for all the recent
demonic activity.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.850
I can do it.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.052
I know you can,
but the Clave--

07:34.054 --> 07:36.188
Will be fine
getting it from me.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.291
Of course they will.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.928
I'll let your mother know
that you're gonna handle this.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.163
I'm sure she'll be
very glad to hear it.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.399
Thanks.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.475
Look familiar?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.848
Maybe. I'd have to
ask my lawyer.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.017
That's the way
you want it?

08:08.755 --> 08:09.988
One lawyer, coming up.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.556
You sit tight.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.895
You want a coffee
or anything?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.037
Garroway.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.273
Coffee?

08:28.275 --> 08:30.842
No. No, I'm good.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.211
Suit yourself.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.717
Camera.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.386
Luke, what is going on?

08:43.190 --> 08:47.025
I think I'm about to be
the prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.493
[sighs] What do we do?
Get the cards.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.694
In my desk, bottom drawer.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.196
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.531
You can't glamour yourselves.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.032
I'm not the only Downworlder
on the force,

08:54.034 --> 08:56.301
and we don't know
who's working for Valentine.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.469
If anybody spots you--

08:57.471 --> 08:58.703
We'd be leading them
right to the Mortal Cup.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.673
Exactly. Better to assume
that everybody has the Sight

09:01.675 --> 09:03.508
than gamble that they don't.
[door lock clicks]

09:03.510 --> 09:05.310
Luke--
I can handle myself.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.946
Hey, what happened
to the camera?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.785
I've asked
the same thing for years.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.061
Slept at Magnus' place?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.429
Didn't do much sleeping.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.932
I was helping
treat Luke's wounds.
That's all.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.999
Really?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.735
What?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.973
[sighs] Nothing.
I believe you.

09:37.244 --> 09:41.279
Okay, Magnus made cocktails.
I'm telling you,
nothing else happened.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.414
When you're
ready to talk about

09:42.416 --> 09:44.015
whatever you
need to talk about,

09:44.017 --> 09:45.083
I'm here.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.785
Hey, I talk to you.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.753
About everything
but your personal life.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.955
You know, and it's
kind of not fair,

09:49.957 --> 09:52.857
because I talk
to you about mine
all the time.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.293
For example,
I broke up with Meliorn.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.862
Really?
Turning over a new leaf?

09:57.864 --> 10:00.899
[scoffs] He was a bit much.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.602
Apparently, I need someone
more Shadowhunter-ish.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.403
Izzy, I realize
that you're trying

10:05.405 --> 10:07.105
to take some of
the family heat,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.140
and I appreciate it,

10:09.142 --> 10:10.809
but you can't
change who you are.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.876
Really?

10:12.546 --> 10:14.646
And you can?
I know who I am.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.247
I'm a guy who's
about to be disowned

10:16.249 --> 10:17.916
when Dad finds out
that Jace and Clary

10:17.918 --> 10:19.551
are still out
doing God knows what.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.553
I think Dad's
used to that by now.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.154
This is Jace
you're talking about.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.390
He said he'd be an hour.
It's been three.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.826
You don't think
he and Clary are...

10:27.828 --> 10:30.695
At a time like this?
Not possible.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.832
[Jace] <i> Really? In here?</i>

10:33.834 --> 10:36.601
[Clary] Why not?
[Jace] There's got
to be a better place.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.670
[Clary] No, here's good.
[Jace] Ow!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.639
[Jace] All right.
[clattering]

10:45.746 --> 10:47.345
[energy pulsating]

10:47.347 --> 10:48.580
You need help with that?

10:48.582 --> 10:50.649
[Clary] I can
deglamourize myself, Jace.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.150
[clattering]
[energy pulsating]

10:52.152 --> 10:54.319
It's "deglamour."
[Clary] Whatever.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.722
The cards?
Right.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.992
How exactly are
we gonna get them?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.528
I doubt we can make
it out of this closet
without drawing attention,

11:03.530 --> 11:07.098
let alone Luke's desk
and you are covered in runes.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.600
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.169
A good plan this time?
90%.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.837
Just follow my lead.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.472
Oh, and I apologize.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.974
Apologize for what?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.509
The other 10%.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.517
[sighs] You son of a bitch!

11:25.519 --> 11:26.751
Oh!

11:30.557 --> 11:32.190
Stop following me!

11:32.191 --> 11:33.824
[whispering] Hey,
what happened to
being discreet?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.660
Hmm?
Wait, what did you say?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.862
You cheated on me?
I... Huh?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.398
I did not. Whoa.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.934
You will never see me
at your crappy
apartment again.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.504
That girl means nothing
to me. Nothing.
[Clary sighs]

11:46.506 --> 11:48.640
Is that the boyfriend
that I heard so much about?

11:48.642 --> 11:49.874
[Clary] Nope, not anymore.
Hi.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.176
I'm dumping him.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.877
Where is all of
Luke's stuff?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.046
IA took everything.
What are you looking for?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.849
I, uh... [stutters]
I lost a house key

11:57.851 --> 11:59.551
and Luke normally keeps
a spare in his desk,

11:59.553 --> 12:01.720
so is there any
way I can get it?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.054
Uh, not till he's cleared.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.057
Cleared?
Of... of what?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.727
Oh, don't worry about it.
We'll get it handled.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.894
Oh.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.997
[Jace] Clary, I'm sorry.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.099
I apologize.
I just want you to know
it only happened, like...

12:14.101 --> 12:15.700
two or...
It just happened
a couple of times

12:15.702 --> 12:17.569
and I am totally--
[both] Shut up.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.937
Babe, come on.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.406
Listen, you don't get
to call her "babe," okay?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.607
In fact, you don't
get to call her at all.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.776
Clary's done with you.
You got it?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.911
Take him out.
[Jace] I have rights.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.013
Perhaps it's for the best?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.248
[sighs]

12:30.250 --> 12:34.252
Oh, matching tattoos.
That's... Big red flag.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.921
Oh. [chuckles] This...
[stutters] It's nothing.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.456
Don't worry about it.
I get it.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.824
You always fall for
the bad boys, right?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.628
Oh, is that just me?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.697
Uh, right, right.
[chuckles] Uh...

12:46.566 --> 12:47.932
I really need that key.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.735
I'm sorry, Clary, but IA
has all of Luke's things

12:50.737 --> 12:52.771
in the evidence
vault upstairs.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.105
Oh.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.007
Maybe I can help you
find the one you lost.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.042
Did you check your bag?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.212
Oh, my God!

13:01.214 --> 13:02.881
You're totally right.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.183
Thank you so much.
[chuckles]

13:06.286 --> 13:07.552
Bye.

13:07.554 --> 13:11.556
I'm going to lunch.
This job is gonna
be the death of me.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.324
French press.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.628
And a garlic bagel.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.996
Extra garlic.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.634
Oh, uh... um...

13:56.636 --> 14:00.672
I'm doing research
for a graphic novel
I'm writing about vampires.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.575
I don't think I'm
actually becoming one,
'cause that would be crazy.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.011
Where's what's-her-face?
Latte-and-no-whip-cream girl?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.613
Clary, uh...

14:09.983 --> 14:12.584
I don't know.
She's not...
answering my texts.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.286
Can't imagine why.
[chuckles]

14:17.824 --> 14:18.890
You all right?

14:20.227 --> 14:23.361
Yeah, it's just, uh...
[sighs] Just think
I need some caffeine.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.996
Okay.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.599
You might want to
let that brew...
Never mind.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.147
[exhales] Okay.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.452
[sighs]

15:07.173 --> 15:08.239
Not again.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.510
[bubbling]

15:23.423 --> 15:24.489
[sighs]

15:26.293 --> 15:27.358
[sniffs]

15:33.934 --> 15:35.133
Can I do something
for you?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.601
I need a list of
everything seized

15:36.603 --> 15:38.036
from Detective
Garroway's desk.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.504
And I need
a slice of pizza.

15:40.874 --> 15:44.609
The list. Now.
Full inventory.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.811
Bring it up
with my office.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.383
I'm sorry I couldn't be
more helpful, but, uh, I...

15:52.385 --> 15:54.552
I'm hungry.
[dog barking]

15:55.488 --> 15:57.221
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.290
[dog growling]

15:59.292 --> 16:01.759
She must smell a rat.
An IA rat.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.161
[scoffs]

16:04.798 --> 16:06.531
[barking]

16:11.438 --> 16:13.805
You know what?
I'm gonna bring Alec
with me next time.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.006
I don't think he's ever
slapped me in the face.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.641
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I panicked.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.943
Someone call for backup?
Yeah. What took
you guys so long?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.445
Funny, I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.579
It's complicated.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.649
We found the Cup.
The Cup?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.484
Yeah, but then we lost it.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.986
We have to sneak back
in the precinct to get it.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.921
This is a disaster.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.323
Hey, demon pox is a disaster.
This is an inconvenience.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.658
We just need a plan.
That's all.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.827
What about a glamour?
We tried that.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.296
Anyone working with Valentine
will see right through it.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.964
Can we ask Magnus Bane
to portal us inside?

16:39.966 --> 16:42.066
No.
That'd be awkward.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.901
[gasps]

16:45.005 --> 16:47.372
Magnus can only portal us
to places he's been to before.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.940
[cell phone ringing]

16:49.976 --> 16:52.677
Not again.
Just give me a second.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.479
Simon, this is
really not a good time.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.647
Clary, where are you?
This is an emergency.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.316
Simon, are you okay?

16:58.318 --> 17:00.184
I'm not sure.
I haven't been
kidnapped yet today.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.586
Simon, seriously,
what's going on?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.089
I think I'm sick.
Like, really sick.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.693
Simon, remember that time
you thought you
had the bird flu?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.194
Okay, just stay
off the Internet
and you'll be fine.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.929
[stutters] Yeah, I know.
But this time it's different.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.098
Hey--
This time I'm really--

17:15.301 --> 17:16.834
Oh, my God.
She hung up on me.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.803
Simon's little
problem can wait.
I've got a great plan.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.171
Oh, there's a first.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.041
[laughs sarcastically]
Just follow my lead.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.476
Oh, and don't worry,
in my plan,
no one gets slapped.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.181
Thanks, Jerry.
I appreciate it.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.249
We're done for today.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.751
But don't go too far.
You'll be hearing from me.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.253
I wouldn't dream of it.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.291
Listen, Garroway, do you
think I'm trying to be
a pain in your ass?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.460
Well, the thought
had occurred to me.

17:44.230 --> 17:48.099
Dude, we've got
your car wrapped
around a street light,

17:48.101 --> 17:49.834
drenched in blood,
carrying a GPS

17:49.836 --> 17:51.436
that puts you at
the scene of the crime.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.472
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just not stupid.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.080
[knocks on door]

18:14.527 --> 18:15.693
[sniffs]

18:32.612 --> 18:33.845
[groans]

18:52.398 --> 18:53.965
Vargas was a good cop.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.134
She was my friend.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.137
One of the few.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.406
Your friends
seem to have a habit
of turning up dead.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.243
I can't even imagine
what your
Facebook page looks like.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.210
You think I killed her?

19:07.147 --> 19:08.980
[inhales] No.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.749
In fact,
I think I'm your alibi.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.551
Well, I'd appreciate that.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.554
Don't thank me just yet.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.390
I still haven't
figured out your deal.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.661
Even a blind guy can tell
something weird is going on.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.929
You want to do
right by Vargas?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.898
Help me out here.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.234
You wouldn't
believe me
if I told you.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.069
Try me.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.838
[Alaric] Fisk.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.241
Think about it.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.548
[Fisk] Yeah.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.317
[Alaric] I checked her wrist.
There's no defensive wounds.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.718
[Fisk] Another demonic murder?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.820
[Alaric]
I don't think so.
Similar MO,

19:49.822 --> 19:52.223
but she wasn't
drained of blood.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.891
The ME have
a time of death?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.226
[Alaric] We're
waiting on forensics,

19:55.228 --> 19:57.628
but early guess
is she's been dead
a couple of hours.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.063
[Fisk] A couple hours?

19:59.065 --> 20:02.300
No way. I just
talked to the captain
45 minutes ago.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.135
You guys are killing me.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.810
Check the body
for venom.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.978
If it's a demon,
I need to know exactly
what I'm looking for.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.047
Okay.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.458
[knock on door]

20:30.063 --> 20:31.329
Simon...

20:32.265 --> 20:33.397
can we have a talk?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.600
"We"?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.301
You, me and your sister.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.189
Do I have a choice?

20:41.190 --> 20:42.974
Well, I've already ducked out
of the office early, so...

20:43.776 --> 20:44.842
no.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.978
Okay.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.914
[sighs]

20:49.916 --> 20:52.316
I stayed out last
night at Maureen's. I...

20:53.119 --> 20:55.319
I should have called.
[stutters] It slipped my mind.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.189
So, what are you gonna do?
Ground me?

20:58.958 --> 21:03.094
Maureen called us
this morning and
she was very upset.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.795
Actually,
Maureen called me...

21:05.698 --> 21:09.066
and she said that
you were spazzing out,
like more than normal.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.534
She said...
She did what?

21:10.536 --> 21:13.104
Well, I just tried
to say that's kind of
how you are with girls,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.840
but, uh, she was
very upset, so...

21:17.377 --> 21:19.777
I told Mom.
You did what?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.948
Simon, Maureen thinks that...
that you might be on drugs.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.784
[stammering]

21:26.786 --> 21:28.586
And listen,
if I thought it
was just marijuana

21:28.588 --> 21:30.521
I wouldn't be so worried,
but, honey...

21:31.424 --> 21:32.623
you look like you're dying.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.792
[scoffs] Would dying get me
out of this conversation?

21:34.794 --> 21:37.828
I know that I'm not
usually the sentimental
one here, but...

21:39.766 --> 21:41.899
we're here for you.
[Elaine] It's all right.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.635
You can tell us,
whatever it is.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.706
Okay, okay, um...

21:54.580 --> 21:56.614
I think I have a disease.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.783
[Elaine] A disease?
Like, a bad one.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.651
[gasps] Do you have an STD?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.486
Okay, let's let him
finish talking.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.255
Look, Simon,
it's really not as
bad as you think.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.289
These things happen,
all right?

22:05.291 --> 22:06.824
When I was in law school,
I experimented--

22:06.826 --> 22:09.660
We're really off track here.
I think we really
need to focus on Simon.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.162
[Elaine] Rebecca,
it's 2016, all right?

22:11.164 --> 22:12.596
Mom, I'm more than happy--
I had a life.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.865
Hey, hey, guys...
[both arguing]

22:14.867 --> 22:16.934
I'm still right here.
[Rebecca] Do not
make this about you.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.369
I'm still right here.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.670
[arguing continues]

22:20.606 --> 22:21.939
Excuse me?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.207
[arguing continues]

22:23.209 --> 22:24.508
Shut up!

22:35.722 --> 22:36.787
Simon?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.129
So, I was promised
a great plan.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.231
We'll head up
towards the vault.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.500
Alec and Izzy are
handling the rest.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.168
All we have to do
is wait for their signal...

22:51.170 --> 22:52.803
[sighs]
...and grab the Cup.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.549
He's on our side.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.717
You sure?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.053
Isn't that the line he used
when he kidnapped you?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.121
Good point.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.895
What now? We're supposed
to climb the elevator shaft

23:17.897 --> 23:19.563
and waltz in
the vault unnoticed?

23:21.567 --> 23:23.234
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

23:23.236 --> 23:24.568
[laughs]

23:26.539 --> 23:27.805
Wait, you're kidding, right?

23:28.908 --> 23:31.642
Remember the binoculars?
Yeah.

23:32.412 --> 23:36.046
This one's a Nyx rune.
It's like night vision.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.248
You can copy mine.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.016
You got it?
Yeah.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.885
Why do I need night vision?

23:40.887 --> 23:41.986
You'll see.

23:44.357 --> 23:45.856
[sighs]

23:45.858 --> 23:47.658
[inhales deeply]

23:49.228 --> 23:50.494
[winces]

23:51.731 --> 23:52.797
Um...

23:52.799 --> 23:54.932
Feel free to ask for help.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.172
[flesh searing]

24:02.208 --> 24:04.942
I, um... I think I can
take it from here.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.878
Where's the fun in that?

24:11.584 --> 24:13.150
[Alec] Okay, I'm guessing
you're the distraction?

24:13.152 --> 24:14.218
Nope.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.454
I've decided to
grow up, remember?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.122
No more distracting for me.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.293
Besides, I don't think
I'm her type.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.828
Oh, crap.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.564
Don't worry,
it's good practice.
Huh?

24:26.566 --> 24:28.699
You know,
for asking out Magnus.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.868
[chuckles]

24:31.771 --> 24:32.970
What are you...
what are you doing?

24:32.972 --> 24:35.239
Unbuttoning your shirt.
What's it look like I'm doing?

24:35.241 --> 24:37.241
Izzy, this is not
really my department.
[sighs] Come on.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.509
You do this sort of
stuff all the time.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.678
You do, I don't.
It's easy.

24:43.516 --> 24:44.648
Come on.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.220
Hey.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.255
Can I help you?

24:51.257 --> 24:53.023
Yeah, um...

24:53.025 --> 24:54.325
[stutters] You
come here often?

24:55.261 --> 24:57.094
I work here.
What can I help you with?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.629
Right, um...

24:58.631 --> 25:00.398
Right, right, right,
yeah, um...

25:00.399 --> 25:02.166
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm looking for
some information.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.802
Oh, look...
Oh, wow.

25:04.804 --> 25:05.970
I'm so sorry.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.204
Let me just get that.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.473
That's not... I'm so sorry.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.176
That's such a mess.
Let me clean that up.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.511
Uh, it's not working. Okay.
Here, let me.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.346
No, I got it.
I got it. Just go. Go.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.514
You sure?
Go.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.915
Thank you so much.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.431
[sizzling]

25:40.206 --> 25:41.472
[groans]

25:42.408 --> 25:44.208
I think you
messed something up.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.010
Really?

25:46.012 --> 25:47.344
No, I didn't.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.646
Then why
isn't it working?

25:48.648 --> 25:49.880
It is.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.249
[alarm blaring]
That's the signal.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.985
Whoa.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.453
Right?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.292
Going up.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.730
[alarm continues]
[Luke] What's going on?

26:06.732 --> 26:09.166
Some sort of power surge.
Whole building's fried.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.901
No lights,
no camera, no nothing.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.069
Get anything
on our killer?

26:12.071 --> 26:13.203
Yeah, you were right.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.406
Huge amounts
of demon venom
in Vargas' blood.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.174
It's a shapeshifter.
All right.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.176
I'm going after it.
Alert the pack.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.778
Anyone sees Vargas,
kill her.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.680
You were trapped in
the precinct all day.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.015
If that demon wanted you dead,
it certainly had
the opportunity.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.684
It's not after me.
It's after Clary.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.085
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
asking for your help.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.521
You're pack leader now.
You don't need to ask.

26:30.523 --> 26:31.922
Thanks, bud.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.133
What is all this crap?

26:44.136 --> 26:45.536
Lunch receipts?

27:11.097 --> 27:12.196
[Clary exhales]

27:14.400 --> 27:16.300
[softly] You're
getting pretty good
with your stele.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.135
Well, at least we know
he's not a Downworlder.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.403
Lucky for us.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.872
Give me a heads up
next time
you're gonna do that.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.184
In here.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.006
This will take all day.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.175
[sighs]

28:03.816 --> 28:05.916
Or you could just do that.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.532
That looks exactly
like the Mortal Cup.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.967
This is it.
It has to be.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.278
What's wrong?

28:35.214 --> 28:36.447
[stutters]
I'm not sure. I...

28:37.983 --> 28:39.216
You're not sure
what's wrong

28:39.218 --> 28:41.452
or you're not sure
where your mom hid the Cup?

28:46.358 --> 28:47.458
[sighs]

28:53.432 --> 28:55.432
Did you get it?
Theoretically.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.234
Theoretically?
Yeah. [sighs]

28:57.236 --> 28:58.736
I found the card.
I just have to figure out

28:58.738 --> 29:00.738
how I reached into
my notebook before.
It's...

29:00.740 --> 29:02.706
It's not an exact science.
Can't you just
pull the Cup out?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.575
I can, theoretically.
I just...

29:04.577 --> 29:05.943
It's not as easy
as it looks, Alec.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.511
Listen, you two can
discuss theories

29:07.513 --> 29:09.079
as much as you want
when we get back
to the Institute.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.914
But right now,
considering we just stole

29:10.916 --> 29:12.182
from the cops,
I suggest we get home.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.751
Guys...
[necklace pulsing]

29:13.753 --> 29:16.587
I think the mundanes
might be
the least of our worries.

29:16.589 --> 29:17.788
Well, at least we know
the demon necklace works.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.990
Never a dull day. Let's go.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.660
Guys, slow down.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.967
[gasps] Oh, I am so sorry.

29:30.936 --> 29:31.935
[roars]

29:34.273 --> 29:35.439
[growling]

29:35.441 --> 29:36.540
Grandma.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.976
[grunts]
[demon screeches]

29:40.279 --> 29:41.645
What the hell?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.082
Language.
Not in front of Grandma.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.984
How did it find us?

29:48.654 --> 29:49.987
[Jace] I don't know...

29:49.989 --> 29:52.556
but she brought friends.
How can you tell?

29:52.558 --> 29:53.957
It's like seeing
through a glamour.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.293
You just got to
pay attention
to the details.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.561
But I can't see anything.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.629
Behind us.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.066
I... I still can't see them.

30:06.739 --> 30:08.272
Okay, there's
too many people.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.808
I don't say this often,
but I agree with Clary.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.676
We gotta get out of here.
Hey, this way!

30:21.153 --> 30:24.021
[panting] What's
the Unlock rune again?

30:26.492 --> 30:28.058
Open sesame.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.894
[Jace] Go.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.870
Hey, what are you doing?

30:39.872 --> 30:42.439
Holding them off.
Take Clary back
to the Institute.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.541
No, if you're staying,
I'm staying.
We fight together.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.611
Don't be stupid.
If the demons get the Cup,
we're dead anyways.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.113
I'm not leaving
anyone behind.
You don't have a choice.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.716
I know you guys are
having a moment, okay?
But we really have to go.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.685
[Isabelle] Don't worry.
It's not like this
is the first time

30:54.687 --> 30:56.720
Alec has saved your life.
[sighs]

30:56.722 --> 30:58.055
I doubt it'd be the last.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.423
Go.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.534
[dialing]

31:10.536 --> 31:12.202
[line ringing]

31:12.204 --> 31:13.337
[Clary] <i> Hello.</i>
Clary?

31:13.339 --> 31:15.539
I need you--
<i>You've reached Clary's phone.</i>

31:15.541 --> 31:17.341
<i> I'm not here,</i>
<i> but you know the deal.</i>

31:17.343 --> 31:19.009
<i> Leave one at the beep.</i>
[line beeps]

31:19.011 --> 31:20.477
Um, Clary...

31:20.479 --> 31:22.279
[shuddering] I
need to talk to you.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.514
I think I need to
talk to you more

31:24.516 --> 31:26.617
than I've ever needed
to talk to you in my life.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.853
I know... [inhales deeply]

31:29.855 --> 31:32.122
I know you're busy
saving your mom, but...

31:34.393 --> 31:36.627
I think I'm
becoming a vampire.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.162
[phone beeps]

31:39.164 --> 31:41.465
Darling, you don't
know the half of it.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.436
Blood is stronger than will.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.572
[shuddering] Shut up.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.575
Stronger than desire.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.543
Shut up! [grunts]

31:53.545 --> 31:56.313
[Camille echoing]
<i> Even stronger than love.</i>

31:59.184 --> 32:01.285
[breathing heavily]

32:10.229 --> 32:11.628
[gasps]

32:14.033 --> 32:16.466
[shuddering]

32:16.468 --> 32:17.868
Come to me.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.505
What you really want is--
[yells]

32:23.309 --> 32:25.175
[gasping]

32:31.817 --> 32:33.150
[sobbing]

32:44.229 --> 32:45.295
[panting] Hold on.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.799
I'm sorry, Jace.
It's okay.
We can take a breather.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.534
[Clary] No, it's not that.
I, um...

32:52.504 --> 32:54.071
I'll scout ahead.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.075
I'm sorry for
all the trouble
I've put you through.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.643
You don't have to
apologize to me, Clary.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.244
Unfortunately,
you can't stop me.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.480
[chuckles] Well, yeah,
I'm starting to see that.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.150
Just... I've been so focused
on trying to find my mom,

33:07.152 --> 33:09.853
I don't think I
realized how much
you've actually done for me.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.888
So, thank you.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.124
Clary, I'm a Shadowhunter.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.126
It's kinda my job.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.494
You... Your job?

33:17.496 --> 33:18.829
Yeah.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.530
Oh, you'd do this
for anybody?

33:21.633 --> 33:23.166
Maybe not Simon.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.168
Funny, I think he'd say
the same thing about you.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.837
You know, you're not
too bad yourself.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.171
Me?
Yeah.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.841
You kicked some
pretty serious ass
back at the police station.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.676
At least, you got
my ass kicked.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.845
Thanks... I think.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.113
[necklace pulsing]

33:37.182 --> 33:39.750
Guys? It's pulsing.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.319
Again?

33:42.321 --> 33:44.588
Getting close.
Let's spread out.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.624
[faint chittering]

33:48.827 --> 33:50.027
Izzy, where is it?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.194
I don't know.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.196
It's like they're right here,
but I don't see them.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.564
[snarling]

33:54.566 --> 33:56.099
[clattering]

34:00.472 --> 34:01.638
[screeching]

34:01.640 --> 34:02.773
[Clary screams]
[grunts]

34:04.743 --> 34:05.976
[grunting]

34:07.212 --> 34:08.445
[snarling]

34:09.681 --> 34:10.981
[gasps]

34:13.552 --> 34:15.585
[Jace grunts]
[gasps]

34:15.587 --> 34:18.088
Are you hurt?
I'll live.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.723
What are those things?

34:19.725 --> 34:21.224
Shax demons.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.692
They're like
the bloodhounds
of the Shadow World.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.594
They've been tracking us.
So what do we do?

34:24.596 --> 34:26.897
The Institute's only
a couple of blocks
from here.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.432
We can't lose them,
but they won't

34:28.434 --> 34:30.000
be able to track us
if we split up.

34:30.002 --> 34:31.234
But, I don't... I don't--

34:31.236 --> 34:32.436
Clary, you'll be fine.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.137
Izzy and I will
draw them away.

34:35.374 --> 34:36.606
No matter what happens,
just keep running.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.041
[snarling]
They're coming.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.810
Jace, I--
Run, Clary!

34:41.013 --> 34:42.979
[panting]

34:51.356 --> 34:53.123
[creature chitters]
Crap!

34:53.125 --> 34:54.524
[screeching]

34:54.526 --> 34:56.593
[whimpering]

35:07.106 --> 35:08.305
[screeching]

35:10.142 --> 35:12.008
Get back!

35:12.744 --> 35:14.177
I said, get back!

35:29.094 --> 35:31.027
[knocking on door]
[Elaine] Simon?

35:32.164 --> 35:34.197
[sighs] You
still alive in there?

35:35.134 --> 35:36.867
Hey, I ordered in Rizzo's.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.037
Are you okay?

35:41.039 --> 35:44.374
I've never heard him
this quiet
around pasta before.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.144
Go.
Yeah? Okay.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.379
All right, Simon,
I'm coming in.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.754
[gasps] Simon?

36:01.493 --> 36:02.692
Oh, my God.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.438
Jace!

36:17.809 --> 36:19.476
Jace?

36:19.478 --> 36:20.677
Clary.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.613
Hey.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.217
Oh, you're hurt!
I'll be all right.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.152
You okay?
Yeah, I'm...

36:29.154 --> 36:30.520
I'm fine. Barely, but--

36:30.522 --> 36:32.856
What happened?
One of the Shax
demons cornered me.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.324
But I got the Cup.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.694
I don't know,
my instincts just kicked in
and I... I could do it.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.697
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'll be
a Shadowhunter after all.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.333
Clary, you're amazing.
I always knew you could do it.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.734
Now give me
the Cup and let's go.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.237
[scoffs] Give you the Cup?
Yes.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.839
Only until we get back
to the Institute.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.641
It's the only way
I can keep you safe.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.110
I'll die before I let
anything happen to you.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.846
Yeah, you're totally right.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.081
[grunts]

36:59.685 --> 37:01.751
Clary? [breathing heavily]

37:03.055 --> 37:04.754
Jace... No! Oh, my God! Jace!

37:04.756 --> 37:06.423
[gasps]

37:08.560 --> 37:10.126
[shuddering]

37:12.864 --> 37:14.297
[snarling]

37:15.400 --> 37:17.500
[roars]

37:32.918 --> 37:34.584
[Luke] Clary!
Get back!

37:34.586 --> 37:35.752
How do I know
you're Luke?

37:35.754 --> 37:38.521
[Luke] I got you spray paint
for your birthday.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.858
What happened?
Uh, demons.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.762
Long story. Um...
[breathing heavily]

37:45.764 --> 37:48.064
Where'd you come from?
Jail.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.116
I ran into Alec.

37:50.117 --> 37:52.167
Said you might be down here.
Thought you
might need some help.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.939
Apparently not.
Looks like she
took care of it.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.274
Shouldn't we get
going or something?

37:57.276 --> 37:58.441
More demons could
be coming, right?

37:58.443 --> 37:59.542
Oh, don't worry about it.

37:59.544 --> 38:00.944
I got the pack
on the lookout.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.445
If there's any other demons,
we'll take care of them.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.481
[chuckles] Look at you,
leader of the pack.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.116
Well, you know,
it has its perks.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.885
Shall we?

38:09.788 --> 38:11.988
Yeah. Right.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.425
These tunnels
are swarming
with Shax demons.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.827
If she's down there,
it's only a matter of time
before they find her.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.562
We need to make sure
that doesn't happen.

38:19.564 --> 38:22.565
All right, listen up.
I want this entire
institute on high alert.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.069
I don't care what
anybody else says,
I'll take full responsibility.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.937
Right now,
Clary is the only
thing that matters.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.005
Jace!

38:29.808 --> 38:30.974
Clary.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.048
I did it. I got the Cup.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.318
I don't care
about the Cup.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.420
When I came out of
the tunnels, I didn't
see you. I was worried

38:43.422 --> 38:45.121
something might
have happened--
There was a demon.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.923
Shapeshifter.
It looked just like you.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.761
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.430
And the demon?

38:53.432 --> 38:55.065
I sent him
straight back to hell.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.233
How'd you know
it wasn't me?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.671
I just knew.
Really?

39:01.673 --> 39:02.872
Kind of a risk,
wasn't it?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.542
Well, this may
come as a surprise,

39:05.544 --> 39:08.278
but I actually do listen
to some of
the things you tell me.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.248
You just have to pay
attention to the details.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.519
Yeah, well,
I told you the first time
we met, you have the Sight.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.055
You're a Shadowhunter,
just like the rest of us.

[exhales]

40:11.576 --> 40:13.009
[Simon] Hello?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.148
Anybody home?

40:23.088 --> 40:25.588
You don't have
a doorbell, so I...
I let myself in.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.326
Raphael?

40:33.432 --> 40:36.199
[whispering]
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.268
All right, I know
someone's here somewhere!

40:39.371 --> 40:40.603
Please!

40:43.208 --> 40:44.841
I think I'm sick.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.548
I need someone to
tell me what's going on,
because it's ruining my life!

40:56.955 --> 40:58.955
Am I becoming a vampire?

40:58.957 --> 41:00.824
[Camille laughing]

41:00.826 --> 41:04.194
Poor darling boy.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.631
I was wondering
when you'd come back.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.534
You...

41:12.771 --> 41:14.037
You're not mad?

41:14.573 --> 41:18.541
On the contrary,
I've been expecting you.

41:19.978 --> 41:25.248
You see...
it's just my blood running
through your veins.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.586
It can have some
curious effects.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.523
But I assure you,
they're all harmless.

41:35.427 --> 41:39.062
In time, they'll fade
and you'll return to normal.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.698
[shudders]

41:43.668 --> 41:46.336
Thank God. Um...

41:46.338 --> 41:50.106
[stuttering]
But I'm okay?
I'm still human?

41:50.108 --> 41:52.108
Well, of course you are.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.112
Or at least you would've been.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.547
[screaming]
