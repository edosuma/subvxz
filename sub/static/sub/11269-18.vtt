Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.019 --> 00:06.621
TV REPORTER: We're going live
now to the Route 93 overpass,

00:06.622 --> 00:09.591
where an unidentified woman
has climbed to the outside rail

00:09.592 --> 00:10.912
and is threatening to jump.

00:10.913 --> 00:13.294
An emergency rescue team
has had no luck so far

00:13.295 --> 00:14.495
in persuading the woman

00:14.497 --> 00:16.487
to climb down
from her dangerous perch.

00:16.488 --> 00:18.166
Oh, boy. As one
who has been there,

00:18.167 --> 00:21.236
it is imperative that
they do nothing to agitate that woman.

00:21.303 --> 00:22.570
Boy, oh, boy. I mean, what

00:22.571 --> 00:24.305
what has
to go wrong with your life

00:24.306 --> 00:26.641
to be driven to such
desperate measures, huh?

00:26.642 --> 00:28.309
We have a tentative
identification.

00:28.310 --> 00:31.045
The woman is
Anna Cosetti of Boston.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.913
Sam, can I
take the afternoon off?

00:32.981 --> 00:34.165
Why?
I gotta go

00:34.233 --> 00:36.703
look after the kids;
That woman's my babysitter.

01:25.618 --> 01:26.884
What's that, Cliff?

01:26.885 --> 01:28.853
They're closing
the Twi-Lite Drive-In.

01:28.854 --> 01:29.971
Oh, you're joking, man.

01:29.972 --> 01:31.022
No, not at all.

01:31.073 --> 01:32.373
Yeah, yeah.

01:32.441 --> 01:35.093
Another American icon
destroyed by the bulldozer.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.928
What are they gonna close next?

01:36.996 --> 01:38.229
Hopefully, your mouth.

01:40.182 --> 01:41.583
Well, I like
drive-ins.

01:41.650 --> 01:43.852
All the great memories
I have of that place.

01:43.919 --> 01:45.052
You know what

01:45.053 --> 01:46.137
I love most about that place?

01:46.138 --> 01:49.207
It has that,
that great hot, fresh popcorn,

01:49.208 --> 01:50.625
and they use real butter there,

01:50.626 --> 01:51.993
not that imitation
yellow stuff.

01:51.994 --> 01:53.861
Isn't that where you proposed
to Vera there, Norm?

01:53.862 --> 01:55.029
Yeah.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.314
Anyway, do you know any place

01:56.315 --> 01:58.450
that has real butter
these days? I don't.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.985
Boy, I've been going
to that place

01:59.986 --> 02:01.386
ever since I was a teenager.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.521
Of course a lot of
the stuff I saw there

02:03.589 --> 02:05.156
was pretty hard core.

02:05.157 --> 02:06.941
They didn't show those
kind of movies there.

02:06.942 --> 02:08.910
Who said they did?

02:10.312 --> 02:12.422
Boy, oh, boy, you know,
I'll never forget

02:12.481 --> 02:14.216
Ma used to take me down there

02:14.283 --> 02:15.983
all bundled up in my pyjamas

02:16.051 --> 02:17.185
and all, you know.

02:17.186 --> 02:19.554
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
it was at the Twi-Lite

02:19.555 --> 02:22.857
that I first saw
Herbie, the Love Bug.

02:22.925 --> 02:26.744
Cliffie, Herbie, the Love
Bug came out in, uh, 1969,

02:26.812 --> 02:28.513
and you were born in, uh...

02:28.580 --> 02:30.630
Oh, please, man, don't.
Don't do the math.

02:33.335 --> 02:35.320
Geez, I feel so left out.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.155
You guys have all
these wonderful memories

02:37.156 --> 02:38.423
about this spot.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.758
I must confess, I've never
even been to a drive-in.

02:40.759 --> 02:43.027
CLIFF:
Well, tonight's your lucky night, Doc.

02:43.028 --> 02:45.897
Uh, it says here, down
at the Twi-Lite they're, uh,

02:45.898 --> 02:48.416
closing up with an
all-night Godzilla marathon.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.618
What do you say,
shall we go? Shall we, huh?

02:50.685 --> 02:51.919
NORM:
Yeah, I'm in.

02:51.987 --> 02:53.838
Geez, I'd love to.
Sounds like fun.

02:53.906 --> 02:56.173
Why don't we all just jump
into my BMW? SAM:

02:56.241 --> 02:59.127
You can't go to a,
a drive-in in a Beemer, man.

02:59.195 --> 03:01.196
You need a classic convertible.

03:01.263 --> 03:02.363
Okay, okay.

03:02.431 --> 03:04.399
I'm sold. So where
do we get one?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.667
Well, Cliff, your mom has
a convertible, doesn't she?

03:06.668 --> 03:08.753
No!

03:08.754 --> 03:10.872
What do you mean?
I saw her just the other day.

03:10.873 --> 03:12.039
She was driving a convertible.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.241
Now, look, Norm,
there's a lot of

03:13.242 --> 03:15.709
beautiful women driving around
in convertibles, all right?

03:15.710 --> 03:16.778
Mr. Clavin, you
wouldn't be afraid

03:16.779 --> 03:18.947
to ask your mom to borrow
the car, would you?

03:18.948 --> 03:21.165
I'm not gonna dignify
that with a yes.

03:22.043 --> 03:24.819
Come on, Cliff.
It's one night.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.054
It's not gonna kill ya.
Yeah.

03:26.055 --> 03:27.655
Come on.
Oh, well.

03:27.656 --> 03:28.957
All right, all
right, all right.

03:28.958 --> 03:29.958
I'll figure something out.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.559
All right, count me in.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.227
All right, great.
What about you, Mr. Peterson?

03:33.228 --> 03:34.795
Well, I'm in, Wood, but, uh,

03:34.796 --> 03:36.397
I can't go to the
snack bar for you guys.

03:36.398 --> 03:37.749
When I was a teenager, I, uh,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.383
ran up quite a
tab at that place.

03:39.451 --> 03:40.552
Well, how big?

03:40.620 --> 03:42.790
Well, they are closing
down, aren't they?

03:49.495 --> 03:50.595
Sam Malone!

03:50.663 --> 03:52.380
Yes.

03:52.448 --> 03:54.048
You know who I am?

03:54.115 --> 03:55.567
No, sir, I don't,

03:55.634 --> 03:58.903
but I swear to you, I never
touched your daughter.

03:58.971 --> 04:04.725
Nah, nah, you bought this
bar from me 17 years ago.

04:04.726 --> 04:06.260
Although, now that
you mention it,

04:06.261 --> 04:07.395
you did touch my daughter.

04:07.396 --> 04:09.864
I'll be damned! Yeah!

04:09.931 --> 04:11.866
Gus O'Malley!
How are you doing?

04:11.933 --> 04:13.067
Look at that.

04:13.068 --> 04:14.268
What are you doing here?

04:14.269 --> 04:15.839
Ah, I came to town
for a wedding

04:15.904 --> 04:17.204
and thought I'd drop by

04:17.272 --> 04:18.856
Boy, this place looks great.

04:18.857 --> 04:20.591
You've really, really
kept it in good shape.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.293
Yeah, thanks for that.

04:22.361 --> 04:23.871
Hey, uh, I want you
to meet, uh...

04:23.872 --> 04:25.263
Carla Tortelli's our waitress.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.397
This is Gus O'Malley.
Hi.

04:26.398 --> 04:27.598
That's Woody, our bartender.

04:27.599 --> 04:28.649
Hi.
Woody.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.553
I bought this place from Gus.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.221
Yeah.
Sam, you've been had.

04:33.289 --> 04:35.290
You already own this bar.

04:38.293 --> 04:40.461
You must be Coach's boy.

04:43.298 --> 04:46.434
It's a good guess,
but, no, he, uh,

04:46.502 --> 04:47.768
actually, you know, uh,

04:47.769 --> 04:49.504
Coach passed away
several years ago.

04:49.505 --> 04:51.573
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.576
You look great. What've,
what've you been doing?

04:54.643 --> 04:56.578
I moved to Arizona
with the wife.

04:56.579 --> 04:58.213
Been living off
my life savings.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.715
Believe me, if you
manage this place right,

05:00.782 --> 05:03.012
it can really provide
for you in your old age.

05:03.051 --> 05:05.353
It can?

05:05.421 --> 05:07.372
Oh, yeah. It's all
in the management.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.640
Oh...

05:08.641 --> 05:10.241
Sam, I'm gonna use
the petty cash

05:10.242 --> 05:11.475
to buy lottery tickets.

05:13.245 --> 05:15.946
The way I figure it,
it's our only hope.

05:16.014 --> 05:18.215
Rebecca, I'd like you
to meet Gus O'Malley.

05:18.216 --> 05:19.717
He used to have
the place before me.

05:19.718 --> 05:21.102
Oh, nice to meet you.
Rebecca.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.388
Hey, Sam, uh...

05:23.455 --> 05:26.491
you and her, huh?
Oh, we, uh...

05:26.558 --> 05:29.527
No, no. No, no,
no. No, no.

05:29.594 --> 05:31.195
It feels so great

05:31.263 --> 05:33.131
to be back here
in this old saloon!

05:33.132 --> 05:35.232
Boy, I could...
Listen, do you think I could,

05:35.233 --> 05:36.800
I could pop back here, you know,

05:36.801 --> 05:38.169
and maybe serve up
one little drink?

05:38.170 --> 05:39.703
You know, just
for old times' sake?

05:39.704 --> 05:40.921
Yeah. Do it. Go on.

05:40.989 --> 05:42.540
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

05:42.608 --> 05:43.808
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.076
This brings it all back.

05:46.144 --> 05:48.178
It's like I never left.

05:48.179 --> 05:49.813
Uh, could I have
a beer, please, Gus?

05:49.814 --> 05:50.948
Sure, Norm.

05:57.489 --> 06:01.409
Something's different.

06:01.477 --> 06:03.177
Gus is back!

06:03.245 --> 06:04.696
How you been, Norm?

06:04.763 --> 06:06.397
I'm all right.
Can't complain.

06:06.398 --> 06:08.233
Yeah. How is
that lovely bride of yours?

06:08.234 --> 06:09.734
What, what was her name again?

06:09.735 --> 06:11.152
Vera.
Oh, yeah.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.671
Vera. Boy, I remember
when they were newly-wed.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.122
You'd come in here every night

06:15.123 --> 06:17.124
and make those goo-goo eyes
at each other.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.192
You're kidding me.

06:18.193 --> 06:19.260
Norm and Vera?

06:19.261 --> 06:20.895
GUS:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.893
He'd recite poetry
to her all the time.

06:22.932 --> 06:25.733
He'd put quarter after
quarter in that jukebox,

06:25.734 --> 06:27.802
and he'd slow dance
with Vera until closing.

06:27.803 --> 06:28.870
You remember that, Norm?

06:28.871 --> 06:30.621
Just give me the beer, Gus.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.479
Hey, guys!

06:38.597 --> 06:40.297
Hey!
Hey, Johnny. Hi, Ed.

06:40.365 --> 06:41.582
Sorry I'm late.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.751
Got the car.
Everything's all set.

06:43.752 --> 06:45.052
Great. How'd you
get your mother

06:45.053 --> 06:46.287
to part with her
precious vehicle?

06:46.288 --> 06:48.556
Oh, I just, uh, poured a
couple of glasses of wine,

06:48.557 --> 06:49.790
cranked the heat up to full,

06:49.791 --> 06:52.293
and, uh, she'll
sleep till Saturday.

06:52.361 --> 06:54.929
All right. Godzilla,
here we come. SAM:

06:54.930 --> 06:56.430
Hey, you guys have a good time.

06:56.431 --> 06:57.431
See you later, Woody.

06:57.432 --> 06:58.666
Listen, I want to
thank you guys

06:58.667 --> 06:59.701
for letting me come along.

06:59.702 --> 07:01.135
Horseplay, you know.
Camaraderie.

07:01.136 --> 07:02.770
Hanging out with the
guys and having fun

07:02.771 --> 07:04.638
is something that's been
sorely missed in my life.

07:04.639 --> 07:06.273
I'm really looking forward
to this drive-in thing.

07:06.274 --> 07:07.474
Yeah, well, in that case,

07:07.475 --> 07:08.876
I suggest we make
you trunk boy.

07:08.877 --> 07:10.511
Wow, trunk boy!

07:10.579 --> 07:12.980
Don't know what it is,
but it sounds fun.

07:13.048 --> 07:16.183
Well, gang, I
got to be leaving.

07:16.251 --> 07:18.853
I haven't had so much
fun in a long, long time.

07:18.921 --> 07:20.254
I feel like a kid again.

07:20.255 --> 07:21.589
Hey, hold on a second here.

07:21.590 --> 07:22.590
Gus, listen.

07:22.591 --> 07:23.925
You know, with Woody leaving

07:23.926 --> 07:25.292
to go to the drive-in
and everything,

07:25.293 --> 07:26.460
I'm a little
short-handed.

07:26.461 --> 07:28.062
What do you say you hop
behind the bar here

07:28.063 --> 07:29.964
and let me put you
on salary for a night?

07:29.965 --> 07:32.499
Nah, you kids don't want
an old buzzard back there.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.601
Yeah, of course.
Come on.

07:33.602 --> 07:34.902
It'd be so great.
You know,

07:34.903 --> 07:36.604
it'd be like having
a little piece of history

07:36.605 --> 07:37.772
behind the bar, you know?

07:37.773 --> 07:39.574
Take us back to our roots.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.408
Besides, we really
like you, Gus.

07:41.476 --> 07:43.544
Well, all right,
all right. I'll do it.

07:43.545 --> 07:44.612
Hey, Sammy?
Yeah.

07:44.613 --> 07:45.813
As long as we
got the old geezer,

07:45.814 --> 07:47.548
I'm gonna take the night off.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.968
W-What do you want
me to do first, boss?

07:51.036 --> 07:53.471
Well, you tell me.
You're the boss.

07:53.472 --> 07:54.271
What?

07:54.272 --> 07:55.623
Yeah, you're gonna

07:55.624 --> 07:57.391
run the place,
just like the old days, Gus.

07:57.392 --> 07:58.826
As a matter of fact...
(rings bell)

07:58.827 --> 07:59.827
Hey, listen up, everybody!

07:59.828 --> 08:01.128
This is Gus O'Malley.

08:01.196 --> 08:04.086
He owned the place before me,
and as far as I'm concerned,

08:04.099 --> 08:05.566
tonight I'm working for him.

08:05.634 --> 08:08.319
(whoops and applause)

08:09.487 --> 08:11.488
Do you mean that, Sam?

08:11.489 --> 08:12.490
Yeah.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.225
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I'm very touched.

08:14.226 --> 08:15.292
Yeah.
Thank you.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.694
Yeah.
Boy, it's, uh,

08:16.762 --> 08:19.163
been a long time;
I'm a little bit rusty.

08:19.231 --> 08:24.235
Long time since I
ran a bar, but here goes.

08:24.302 --> 08:26.504
All right! All right!
Let's move it!

08:26.572 --> 08:28.639
Let's move it!
Let's move it, sexy.

08:28.707 --> 08:29.974
And you, too.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.341
Let's move it! Move it!

08:31.409 --> 08:33.961
I wanna see your butt
moving, not your lips.

08:34.028 --> 08:37.047
Oh, yeah, that feels right.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.609
Great.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.776
Finally we park.

08:49.844 --> 08:52.246
You only drove around
the lot three times.

08:52.247 --> 08:54.015
I had to get my
bearings there, Norm.

08:54.016 --> 08:55.216
Oh, yeah, I used to come

08:55.217 --> 08:56.950
with my high school
buddies all the time

08:56.951 --> 08:59.001
and I'd go to the
snack bar and come back...

08:59.021 --> 09:00.388
couldn't find the car.

09:00.455 --> 09:01.505
Damnedest thing.

09:01.556 --> 09:03.724
Kept happening
over and over again.

09:03.791 --> 09:07.027
Cliff, did it ever occur to you
that maybe the fellows were...?

09:08.530 --> 09:11.316
Never mind.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.218
Let's hook up the speaker.
All right.

09:14.219 --> 09:15.887
No, no, hold your
horses there, Woody.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.289
You know, those things can
chip and scratch. Uh...

09:18.356 --> 09:21.659
See if I can get
the old speaker doily here.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.711
Yeah.

09:23.712 --> 09:25.313
You know, my mom
made this herself.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.414
(thumping)

09:26.481 --> 09:28.516
FRASIER:
Hey, are we there yet?

09:28.584 --> 09:29.717
Uh-oh. Trunk boy.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.853
Yeah.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.722
Oh, hang on, Doc, we're coming!

09:34.790 --> 09:37.057
FRASIER:
Well, hurry up!

09:38.260 --> 09:40.060
Ah, no!
What?

09:40.128 --> 09:42.418
Ah, the stupid key
broke off in the lock there.

09:42.419 --> 09:44.248
FRASIER:
Hey, what's going on out there?

09:44.249 --> 09:45.716
Don't panic, okay?

09:45.784 --> 09:48.953
Th-The first rule of being
trunk boy is, "Don't panic."

09:49.021 --> 09:50.538
Now, I have some news for you

09:50.605 --> 09:52.073
that you may find upsetting.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.075
Cliff broke the key
off in the lock.

09:54.142 --> 09:55.776
FRASIER:
What?!

09:55.777 --> 09:56.944
(banging) Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:56.945 --> 09:58.545
Don't be putting dents
in that lid, huh?

09:58.546 --> 09:59.847
(banging)

09:59.915 --> 10:01.549
Oh, thank God! Air!

10:01.616 --> 10:03.784
Oh, great, great.
Thanks a lot, Doc.

10:03.851 --> 10:07.121
In your cowardly desire to
live, you broke Ma's trunk.

10:07.188 --> 10:08.989
That's fine.
Let's watch the movie.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.824
Come on, guys.
The movie's about to start.

10:10.825 --> 10:11.959
I don't mind telling you,

10:11.960 --> 10:13.627
That-that's the most
terrifying thing

10:13.628 --> 10:15.062
I've ever gone
through in my life.

10:15.063 --> 10:16.497
Yeah, well, we saved six bucks.

10:16.498 --> 10:17.898
Oh? That much?
Yeah.

10:20.868 --> 10:22.770
Wood, you want to make the, uh,

10:22.771 --> 10:24.605
first, uh, run
to the snack bar, please?

10:24.606 --> 10:25.996
Sure. What do
you guys want?

10:26.007 --> 10:28.576
Well, I'll have a mineral water

10:28.643 --> 10:31.345
and a decaf cap, and, um...

10:31.413 --> 10:33.847
Oh! Bring me some
Toblerone chocolate.

10:33.915 --> 10:37.001
You really don't get the
drive-in experience, do you?

10:37.069 --> 10:38.152
I'm trying.

10:38.153 --> 10:39.854
Hey, uh, listen,
if we're talking

10:39.855 --> 10:42.323
about having messy snacks in
the car, I guess it's apropos

10:42.324 --> 10:44.158
to go over Ma's rules

10:44.225 --> 10:46.460
as regards the food
and beverage service.

10:46.461 --> 10:48.496
Uh, Norm, you want to get
the, uh, flyers

10:48.497 --> 10:50.464
out of the glove
compartment there, please?

10:50.465 --> 10:51.632
Cliff, uh, listen...

10:51.633 --> 10:53.334
Tell you what?
While I pass out these,

10:53.335 --> 10:54.869
uh, flyers, why
don't you go ahead

10:54.870 --> 10:56.070
and get the, uh, snacks, okay?

10:56.071 --> 10:57.237
We'll save time that way.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.928
Oh, capital idea.
Very efficient.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.457
Be back in a flash.
Okay.

11:03.779 --> 11:07.147
Ma's rule number one-
ditch the mail-man.

11:07.215 --> 11:08.900
(engine starting)

11:14.790 --> 11:16.891
Shake your booty, Tortelli!

11:16.958 --> 11:18.525
You got scotches waiting.

11:18.593 --> 11:20.561
My policy is that
if the customer

11:20.562 --> 11:22.013
doesn't get the drink
within 30 seconds,

11:22.014 --> 11:23.498
they're on the house,

11:23.499 --> 11:26.266
which means you're docked
for the price of the beverage.

11:26.267 --> 11:27.301
I'll dock you.

11:27.302 --> 11:28.435
I heard that.

11:28.436 --> 11:31.172
You know, between you and me,

11:31.173 --> 11:33.307
I think she needed that
little kick in the butt.

11:33.308 --> 11:35.509
She's always just doing
exactly what she wants to do,

11:35.510 --> 11:36.977
and she never
gets any work done.

11:36.978 --> 11:39.746
Well, it must be nice
to have the kind of job

11:39.814 --> 11:42.949
where you just stand around
all day and talk all the time.

11:43.017 --> 11:44.685
Excuse me?

11:44.753 --> 11:47.738
Am I to assume that the time
cards have been finished?

11:47.806 --> 11:49.122
That you've completed

11:49.191 --> 11:50.891
the work schedule
for next week?

11:50.892 --> 11:53.327
That you made out the
deposit slips for this money

11:53.328 --> 11:55.329
that is overflowing
the cash drawer here?

11:55.330 --> 11:57.664
While you're standing around,
I've been hustling drinks!

11:57.665 --> 11:59.033
Well, I have been very busy.

11:59.034 --> 12:01.335
Well, maybe you've been
flapping your lips there! Hey!

12:01.336 --> 12:02.736
(bell rings)

12:02.804 --> 12:04.037
Tortelli!

12:04.105 --> 12:06.407
You got boilermakers
here, Tortelli!

12:10.278 --> 12:12.546
Oh, Sam, can I talk
to you for a minute?

12:12.614 --> 12:14.147
Sure. Sure.

12:14.215 --> 12:17.351
Well, suddenly we're in Hawaii
lounging on the beach.

12:17.419 --> 12:20.638
Could, could you just
give us a second here, Gus?

12:20.705 --> 12:22.506
Right. That's exactly
what you got.

12:22.574 --> 12:24.158
Sam, cute is cute,

12:24.226 --> 12:27.861
but you got to do something
about Captain Bligh over there.

12:27.862 --> 12:29.163
All right, yeah,
I'll talk to him.

12:29.164 --> 12:30.264
I'll talk to him.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.399
Hey, Gus, I have an idea.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.584
Let me give you a break here.

12:33.585 --> 12:37.155
You've been working
your buns off here.

12:37.222 --> 12:38.689
Oh, I get it.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.457
The old man's in the way, huh?

12:40.525 --> 12:43.961
Well, I guess you can't
go home again after all.

12:44.029 --> 12:46.763
For a few precious hours there,

12:46.832 --> 12:49.133
I was able to forget
about my heart condition.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.752
Gus, you have a...

12:51.753 --> 12:53.153
you have a heart condition?

12:53.154 --> 12:54.772
Well, I didn't want
to bring it up,

12:54.773 --> 12:56.463
but I mean, uh,
who cares, right?

12:56.475 --> 12:57.658
Yeah.

12:57.726 --> 12:59.593
No, no.

12:59.661 --> 13:00.928
Oh, shoot!

13:00.929 --> 13:03.731
You know, uh, completely forgot,
I got something to do here.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.149
Uh, oh, damn.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.684
Can you, can you,
uh, fill in for me

13:06.685 --> 13:07.685
for the rest of the night?

13:07.686 --> 13:08.852
You wouldn't mind, would you?

13:08.853 --> 13:10.003
You mean that, Sam?

13:10.071 --> 13:11.305
Yeah, please.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.140
Sam, you made me a happy man!

13:13.141 --> 13:14.158
Ah, great.

13:14.159 --> 13:16.243
All right!
All right!

13:16.311 --> 13:18.045
Who went over my head?!

13:18.113 --> 13:20.414
Who double-crossed Gus?!

13:23.235 --> 13:27.038
Well, suddenly our tongues
ain't wagging no more, are they?

13:27.105 --> 13:28.839
That's very interesting.

13:34.679 --> 13:38.365
So, this is your
precious drive-in?

13:38.433 --> 13:39.834
(chuckles)

13:39.901 --> 13:41.936
Tin box squawking in our ears,

13:42.004 --> 13:44.805
endless parade of people
walking in front of the car,

13:44.873 --> 13:46.891
a man in a rubber dragon suit

13:46.958 --> 13:49.560
stepping on miniature
Japanese houses.

13:49.627 --> 13:52.563
Yeah, you believe they're
gonna tear this place down?

13:52.564 --> 13:54.765
You guys, this couldn't
really happen, could it?

13:54.766 --> 13:56.133
Hmm?

13:56.134 --> 13:58.468
I mean, don't think I'm stupid
or anything, but I mean,

13:58.469 --> 14:01.154
you know, if there really was
atomic testing offshore,

14:01.155 --> 14:03.023
and it woke up a dinosaur,

14:03.090 --> 14:06.193
and it got affected by
the radiation, I mean,

14:06.260 --> 14:08.195
you know, not
exactly like this,

14:08.262 --> 14:10.931
but maybe something
pretty close?

14:10.998 --> 14:12.499
NORM:
Woody, Woody, Woody,

14:12.567 --> 14:14.201
when are you gonna grow up?

14:14.269 --> 14:15.602
(chuckles)

14:15.670 --> 14:17.637
Course it could happen.

14:17.638 --> 14:19.023
You know, I'm getting
kind of cold.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.758
Do you think we can
put the top up?

14:20.825 --> 14:22.543
Uh, sure, Fras.

14:28.349 --> 14:30.517
(mechanical grinding)

14:31.586 --> 14:32.953
What happened?

14:33.021 --> 14:34.388
I don't know. It's stuck.

14:34.389 --> 14:35.823
Well, put it
back down. Here.

14:35.824 --> 14:37.034
I'm trying.
It's jammed.

14:37.091 --> 14:40.695
(car horn honking)

14:40.762 --> 14:42.463
MAN:
Hey, put that thing down!

14:42.464 --> 14:43.864
We're trying to watch a movie!

14:43.865 --> 14:45.265
Let me handle
this, Norm. (car horn honking)

14:45.266 --> 14:49.102
I'm a great believer in
the retort courteous.

14:49.170 --> 14:51.220
Why don't you move
your car, butt head?!

14:54.843 --> 14:56.510
Yep.
Good work, Dr. Crane.

14:56.578 --> 14:57.878
They stopped honking.

14:57.946 --> 15:01.315
Many an upperclassman was
afraid of the lash of my tongue.

15:01.316 --> 15:02.883
Well, you know, Norm,
I think you were

15:02.884 --> 15:05.519
way out of line
with that "butt head" crack.

15:05.587 --> 15:07.054
Oh, hi.
How you doing there?

15:07.121 --> 15:09.139
NORM:
Look, uh,

15:09.140 --> 15:10.140
it's-it's jammed.

15:10.141 --> 15:11.742
It-it won't go down. It, uh...

15:17.449 --> 15:19.533
Thank you!

15:21.502 --> 15:23.804
CLIFF:
Oh, well, there you guys are.

15:23.872 --> 15:26.406
Boy, I get so turned
around in these drive-ins.

15:26.474 --> 15:28.208
(chuckles)

15:28.276 --> 15:29.326
Hey.

15:29.343 --> 15:31.579
Hey, what-what
happened to the top?!

15:31.580 --> 15:32.913
All right, come on, you guys.

15:32.914 --> 15:34.481
I'm taking names.

15:34.549 --> 15:36.899
Well, geez, Cliff,
it-it was the guy behind us.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.351
He just went over
to the snack bar.

15:38.352 --> 15:39.587
You can't miss him.

15:39.588 --> 15:41.822
He's got the sort of
fashion risk hair style.

15:41.823 --> 15:43.023
Oh.

15:43.091 --> 15:44.825
A little punky
freak, huh? Yeah.

15:44.826 --> 15:45.926
I'll-I'll deal
with him.

15:45.927 --> 15:47.828
Okay.

15:50.197 --> 15:52.307
Now, what the hell is
that supposed to be,

15:52.366 --> 15:53.767
a giant moth?

15:53.835 --> 15:55.886
Well, it's funny
you should bring it up.

15:55.953 --> 15:57.087
That's Mothra.

15:57.088 --> 15:58.822
They're trying to figure out
a way to kill it.

15:58.823 --> 16:01.225
Yeah? Why don't they
just throw a wool suit over the city,

16:01.226 --> 16:03.294
and when he goes
for it, zap him?

16:13.955 --> 16:15.656
How'd it go, Cliff?

16:15.723 --> 16:18.192
Oh, just fine.

16:18.193 --> 16:19.559
Cliff, where's my chocolate?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.328
You don't want to know.

16:29.704 --> 16:32.139
So, uh, what'd I miss?

16:32.206 --> 16:33.407
Why-why is
that girl,

16:33.408 --> 16:35.576
uh, running around
screaming at everybody?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.462
Well, she's trying to convince
them that, uh, that Godzilla's

16:38.463 --> 16:40.431
merely confused and not really
trying to hurt them.

16:40.432 --> 16:44.250
Isn't that the part usually
played by Akiro Nakamoto?

16:44.318 --> 16:45.752
Yeah, yeah.

16:45.821 --> 16:48.823
But, uh, she left halfway
through the Godzilla series.

16:48.824 --> 16:49.924
I don't understand.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.058
Why would an actress leave

16:51.059 --> 16:53.527
right in the middle
of a successful series?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.133
(clanking)

16:59.134 --> 17:00.551
Woody, Woody,
what are you doing?

17:00.552 --> 17:01.702
I'm not doing anything.

17:01.703 --> 17:02.936
Why is the car shaking?

17:02.937 --> 17:03.937
I don't know.

17:03.938 --> 17:05.204
Well, I'm not doing anything.

17:05.205 --> 17:06.740
Hold it. I know
what's going on here.

17:06.741 --> 17:07.773
What? What is it?

17:07.775 --> 17:09.442
Well, there's
a teenager back here

17:09.443 --> 17:11.512
with a tattoo in the shape
of a flaming skull

17:11.512 --> 17:13.814
relieving you of your tires.

17:13.882 --> 17:15.582
(power drill whirring)

17:15.650 --> 17:17.349
Geez, Ma's gonna kill me.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.685
What are we gonna do?

17:18.685 --> 17:20.119
All right, everybody
get on the floor,

17:20.121 --> 17:21.555
don't make any eye contact.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.888
We might have a chance.

17:29.664 --> 17:31.315
All right, one more time.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.382
It's Cheers.

17:32.383 --> 17:33.717
The "C" is for...

17:33.784 --> 17:34.834
Courtesy.
Courtesy.

17:34.852 --> 17:36.153
The "H" is for...

17:36.221 --> 17:37.387
Honesty.
Honesty.

17:37.455 --> 17:38.688
The "E" is for...

17:38.756 --> 17:39.889
Energy.
Energy.

17:39.957 --> 17:41.291
The other "E" is for...

17:41.359 --> 17:42.859
More energy.
More energy.

17:42.927 --> 17:44.495
The "R" is for...

17:44.562 --> 17:46.263
Right, Gus.
Right, Gus.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.917
Which you "S" for "say"
when I give an order.

17:49.984 --> 17:53.087
You know, Gus, I-I think
what the problem is here

17:53.154 --> 17:55.655
that you are just being
a little too hard on us.

17:55.723 --> 17:58.091
Well, thank you
very much, Miss Howe,

17:58.159 --> 18:02.730
for telling me that I have to
pussyfoot around my employees.

18:02.797 --> 18:07.034
Incidentally, in my day,
a woman in the public eye

18:07.102 --> 18:10.403
made it her business to look
as attractive as possible.

18:10.471 --> 18:11.521
What?

18:11.572 --> 18:13.573
Have they stopped
making lipstick?

18:13.641 --> 18:15.342
Am I that old?

18:15.409 --> 18:16.459
Come on, Gus.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.677
Gus, what are you doing, man?

18:17.678 --> 18:19.279
You can't talk to them
like this, damn it.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.413
These are my employees.

18:20.414 --> 18:21.614
They're my friends, too.

18:21.649 --> 18:24.000
I trained them,
and I'm gonna stand by them.

18:24.068 --> 18:27.638
You people are the most
thoughtless, lazy bunch of slobs

18:27.639 --> 18:29.973
I've ever had the misfortune
to know in my entire life!

18:29.974 --> 18:32.359
How do you expect
to serve the public?

18:32.427 --> 18:35.062
You people have taken
the good name of Cheers...

18:35.130 --> 18:37.264
a name I worked so
hard to build up...

18:37.265 --> 18:38.832
and you've turned
it into garbage.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.116
And if you think

18:40.117 --> 18:41.851
I'm a hard worker,
you should've known the guy

18:41.852 --> 18:43.604
that owned this place before me.

18:43.671 --> 18:45.455
He collapsed and died

18:45.523 --> 18:47.174
right here in this bar,

18:47.241 --> 18:50.143
right there where
you're standing this minute!

18:50.211 --> 18:54.582
I realize that I cannot
fire the lot of you

18:54.649 --> 18:56.516
just because you disgust me.

18:56.517 --> 18:58.285
So I'm gonna do
the next best thing,

18:58.286 --> 19:00.253
and I'm gonna walk out of here.

19:00.321 --> 19:02.189
Now, you can have your apron,

19:02.256 --> 19:04.925
and you can have your damn bar!

19:08.279 --> 19:10.213
Sam?

19:11.583 --> 19:15.836
Boy, tonight was the most fun
I've had in 20 years.

19:17.605 --> 19:20.507
Oh, I thank you, all of you,
so very, very much.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.610
Listen, if you people
are ever in Arizona,

19:23.678 --> 19:25.045
you got a place to stay.

19:25.046 --> 19:27.581
Oh, wait, wait, wait, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute here.

19:27.582 --> 19:28.682
Here.

19:28.683 --> 19:29.750
This is tonight's
receipts, you see?

19:29.751 --> 19:31.317
The-the cash drawer

19:31.318 --> 19:33.470
was full, and that's
what's-what's left over.

19:33.471 --> 19:34.521
Good night, Sam.

19:34.573 --> 19:35.672
Good night, ladies.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.674
Good night, Cheers.

19:44.815 --> 19:46.783
All right, all right, all right!

19:46.851 --> 19:48.768
Okay, let's get a move on.

19:48.837 --> 19:49.887
Let's get a move on.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.271
I want to see your butts moving,

19:51.272 --> 19:53.106
not your lips!
Come on!

19:53.174 --> 19:54.474
Move it!
Move it!

19:54.542 --> 19:56.427
Move it! Move it! Move it!

20:00.831 --> 20:02.816
Well, thanks for
coming to the rescue.

20:02.884 --> 20:05.752
Well, lucky for you they
only took the one tire.

20:05.753 --> 20:06.853
Got the spare on.

20:06.854 --> 20:07.921
She's as good as new.

20:07.922 --> 20:09.372
So if you have
any more problems,

20:09.373 --> 20:10.841
just do what you did before...

20:10.842 --> 20:12.776
lean on the horn and scream
"They're killing us.

20:12.777 --> 20:14.711
They're killing us."

20:14.712 --> 20:16.379
Well, thank you
very much, officer.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.181
And, uh, here you go.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.051
Little something for yourself.

20:21.119 --> 20:24.855
Stamps?

20:24.923 --> 20:27.758
What the hell am I
gonna do with stamps?

20:31.462 --> 20:35.132
Well, guys, you think
Godzilla there is, uh,

20:35.199 --> 20:38.835
ferocious with his fire breath
and crushing buildings, huh?

20:38.903 --> 20:42.072
Wait till you see Ma when
she gets a load of this car.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.141
I'll be off on the
next boat to Rio.

20:44.142 --> 20:47.277
You can say good-bye to
your old buddy, Cliff, that's for sure.

20:47.278 --> 20:49.146
Well, sorry about that,
Mr. Clavin.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.064
Well, you know, it's been

20:50.065 --> 20:51.331
a pretty miserable night,
actually.

20:51.332 --> 20:54.268
What do you say we call it
a night and head home?

20:54.335 --> 20:56.153
Oh, no you don't, Doc.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.289
We went through all this
so we could have a good time

20:58.290 --> 21:00.524
at the drive-in, and that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.408
Oh, come on, Cliff.

21:01.409 --> 21:02.409
There's only one more movie.

21:02.410 --> 21:03.910
We all know what's gonna happen.

21:03.911 --> 21:06.413
There's gonna be atomic testing,
Godzilla's gonna wake up,

21:06.414 --> 21:08.314
gets mad, goes and eats Tokyo,

21:08.315 --> 21:10.083
fights some other monster,
disappears into the ocean.

21:10.084 --> 21:11.150
The end.

21:11.218 --> 21:13.870
Oh, well, thanks a lot,
Dr. Crane.

21:16.741 --> 21:19.709
Oh, look, please, you know,
you guys, I don't know,

21:19.710 --> 21:21.478
your attraction to
the drive-in experience,

21:21.479 --> 21:22.879
it just eludes me.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.549
I mean, no wonder they're
tearing all these places down.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.601
Yeah, maybe you're
right. Yeah.

21:27.669 --> 21:30.771
Maybe there is something to
being out on Friday night,

21:30.838 --> 21:33.139
and you're hanging out
with all your pals

21:33.207 --> 21:35.408
and watching the movie.

21:35.476 --> 21:36.944
I guess those days are gone.

21:37.011 --> 21:40.547
Gentlemen, may I suggest that
you are not mourning the loss

21:40.615 --> 21:44.250
of this drive-in, but rather
the loss of your youth.

21:44.318 --> 21:47.937
Guess you're right, Doc.

21:47.938 --> 21:49.973
Wow, it's kind of sad
when you think about it.

21:49.974 --> 21:51.975
Mmm. Yeah.

21:51.976 --> 21:53.544
Yeah, I think you hit the tail

21:53.545 --> 21:57.414
right on the donkey
with that one, Doc.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.412
Yes, it's the
superficial trappings

21:59.417 --> 22:01.051
of youth that we yearn for.

22:01.118 --> 22:04.221
We wish for time
to stand still, and why?

22:04.289 --> 22:06.459
Because we are afraid
of our own mortality.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.541
Sure.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.860
But sooner or later,

22:09.928 --> 22:11.762
it's time for men to put aside

22:11.829 --> 22:16.232
childish things because, well,
they are no longer childs.

22:19.336 --> 22:21.905
So, as a great poet once
said, "If I were a child..."

22:21.972 --> 22:24.441
You know, Cliff,
uh, tell you what,

22:24.442 --> 22:26.743
before we take off, why don't
you get one more look at that,

22:26.744 --> 22:28.478
uh, that little popcorn girl
you were telling us about?

22:28.479 --> 22:29.479
Hey, yeah.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.781
Have one more tub
of that popcorn.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.348
Yeah, you bet.
Tell you what, here.

22:32.349 --> 22:34.584
Sweet on me,
wasn't she? My treat.

22:34.652 --> 22:36.586
Yeah.

22:39.509 --> 22:42.392
Gonna find
another parking spot?

22:42.393 --> 22:43.493
Hell, no.
We're going home.

22:43.494 --> 22:44.761
