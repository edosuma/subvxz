06:44.037 --> 06:45.771
<i>Kind of paranoid she was?</i>

06:45.773 --> 06:47.038

07:03.490 --> 07:04.990

07:04.992 --> 07:06.358
<i>And it turned into an ugly</i>

07:06.360 --> 07:07.259
<i>Situation.</i>

07:07.261 --> 07:09.060
<i>And my friend, kaylin, had sent</i>

07:09.062 --> 07:10.128
<i>Me some pictures.</i>

07:10.130 --> 07:11.062

<i>Synced to my account.</i>

07:21.708 --> 07:24.109
<i>Zoe took the pictures, and she</i>

07:24.111 --> 07:25.644
<i>Blasted it on facebook, trying</i>

<i>To be evil and get at me.</i>

07:27.948 --> 07:29.214
<i>>> and she uploaded them on your</i>

07:49.002 --> 07:50.569
<i>Still hacked into my account,</i>

07:50.571 --> 07:52.337
<i>And let's say she took a picture</i>

07:52.339 --> 07:53.872
<i>On her iphone, it would sync</i>

07:53.874 --> 07:55.073
<i>To my facebook.</i>

07:55.075 --> 07:57.008
<i>And there was this one picture,</i>

07:57.010 --> 07:59.978
<i>And it was a heavier-set girl</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:01.179
<i>With a big gap.</i>

08:01.181 --> 08:02.614
<i>Like, I'm asking, "zoe, zoe, who</i>

08:02.616 --> 08:03.682
<i>Is this girl?"</i>

08:03.684 --> 08:04.783
<i>She said, "oh, that's my friend,</i>

08:04.785 --> 08:05.884
<i>Cassandra."</i>

08:05.886 --> 08:07.719

08:13.760 --> 08:14.726
<i>This girl?</i>

08:14.728 --> 08:16.194
<i>>> every time I do try to move</i>

08:16.196 --> 08:18.263
<i>On, somehow she gets in contact</i>

08:18.265 --> 08:19.264
<i>With me.</i>

08:19.266 --> 08:20.732
<i>She calls me crying,</i>

08:20.734 --> 08:22.834
<i>Apologizing, or saying that, you</i>

08:22.836 --> 08:24.202
<i>Know, I'm who she wants.</i>

08:24.204 --> 08:26.238
<i>If it was a friend, I would sit</i>

08:26.240 --> 08:27.072
<i>Here and say, "man, you're an</i>

08:27.074 --> 08:27.806
<i>Idiot.</i>

08:27.808 --> 08:30.275
<i>Like, just let it go."</i>

08:32.613 --> 08:33.912
<i>>> I don't get the feeling that</i>

08:33.914 --> 08:35.881
<i>You really want to escape.</i>

08:35.883 --> 08:37.549
<i>>> I don't really want to</i>

08:37.551 --> 08:40.018
<i>Escape, but, like, I don't</i>

08:40.020 --> 08:40.684
<i>Want--</i>

08:40.687 --> 08:42.187

13:28.341 --> 13:29.574
<i>Just wrote me out of the blue</i>

13:29.576 --> 13:31.709
<i>And was like, "hey."</i>

13:31.711 --> 13:32.844
<i>And then she sent me, like,</i>

13:32.846 --> 13:35.513

13:38.251 --> 13:39.517
<i>These pictures?"</i>

13:39.519 --> 13:40.919
<i>So immediately I sent kaylin</i>

13:40.921 --> 13:41.820

13:41.822 --> 13:43.121
<i>>> I was just in shock.</i>

13:52.065 --> 13:52.730
<i>You know?</i>

13:52.732 --> 13:53.665

13:57.737 --> 13:58.403

13:59.873 --> 14:00.738
<i>Like, "she's crazy.</i>

14:00.740 --> 14:01.673
<i>I'm sorry."</i>

14:01.675 --> 14:02.740
<i>I was like, "you need to fix</i>

14:02.742 --> 14:04.475
<i>This because, if she posts them,</i>

14:04.477 --> 14:05.443
<i>My life is done.</i>

14:05.445 --> 14:08.112
<i>Like, I'm ruined."</i>

14:08.114 --> 14:10.215
<i>>> and so why was that a problem</i>

14:10.217 --> 14:11.249
<i>Between you guys?</i>

14:11.251 --> 14:13.151
<i>>> because I wasn't on kaylin's</i>

14:13.153 --> 14:13.952
<i>Side.</i>

14:13.954 --> 14:15.353
<i>I said, "you should've never</i>

14:31.938 --> 14:32.837
<i>Careful.</i>

<i>Basically, not wanting her to</i>

14:36.009 --> 14:36.741
<i>Post them.</i>

29:29.301 --> 29:31.201
<i>How did you get my address?</i>

29:31.203 --> 29:31.969
<i>>> it really wasn't that hard,</i>

29:31.971 --> 29:33.370
<i>Actually.</i>

29:33.372 --> 29:34.404
<i>>> okay.</i>

29:34.406 --> 29:37.407
<i>>> so...</i>

29:37.409 --> 29:38.375
<i>You're zoe.</i>

29:38.377 --> 29:41.044
<i>>> yeah.</i>

29:41.046 --> 29:50.854
<i>Okay.</i>

29:50.856 --> 29:52.189
<i>>> obviously, you know who I am.</i>

29:52.191 --> 29:52.990
<i>I'm craig.</i>

29:52.992 --> 29:53.857
<i>>> yeah, I'm fully aware.</i>

29:53.859 --> 29:54.625
<i>>> and this is my sister,</i>

29:54.627 --> 29:55.626
<i>Miriah.</i>

29:55.628 --> 29:56.560
<i>>> yeah.</i>

29:56.562 --> 30:01.064
<i>>> um...</i>

30:01.066 --> 30:02.566
<i>>> I imagine you know why we're</i>

30:02.568 --> 30:03.567
<i>Here.</i>

30:03.569 --> 30:04.802
<i>You've been pretending to be</i>

30:04.804 --> 30:06.870
<i>This girl, zoe, online now for</i>

30:06.872 --> 30:08.038
<i>Quite some time.</i>

30:08.040 --> 30:09.573
<i>And we were hoping to see if you</i>

30:09.575 --> 30:11.575
<i>Had an explanation or some</i>

30:11.577 --> 30:12.342
<i>Excuse or anything you wanted to</i>

30:12.344 --> 30:13.010
<i>Say.</i>

30:13.012 --> 30:17.314
<i>>> I don't got no excuse.</i>

30:17.316 --> 30:18.382
<i>>> what was your purpose?</i>

30:18.384 --> 30:19.049
<i>Like, why?</i>

30:19.051 --> 30:19.850
<i>>> um...</i>

30:19.852 --> 30:20.651
<i>It was a just a joke that just</i>

30:20.653 --> 30:21.852
<i>Got out of hand.</i>

30:21.854 --> 30:25.389
<i>So...</i>

30:25.391 --> 30:26.390
<i>>> but what you've done, it's</i>

30:26.392 --> 30:27.591
<i>Like, you know how many times I</i>

30:27.593 --> 30:28.258
<i>Contemplated...</i>

30:28.260 --> 30:28.926
<i>>> I mean, listen...</i>

30:28.928 --> 30:29.893
<i>>> in my mind, like, "am I</i>

30:29.895 --> 30:31.028
<i>[bleep] crazy?"</i>

30:31.030 --> 30:32.062
<i>>> you don't have to sit there</i>

30:32.064 --> 30:33.063
<i>And tell me what I've done</i>

30:33.065 --> 30:35.165
<i>Because I'm fully aware of what</i>

30:35.167 --> 30:36.533
<i>I've done.</i>

30:36.535 --> 30:37.201
<i>[chuckles]</i>

30:37.203 --> 30:37.868
<i>>> but why?</i>

30:37.870 --> 30:38.569
<i>What'd you get from it?</i>

30:38.571 --> 30:40.437
<i>>> it was just a [chuckles]...</i>

30:40.439 --> 30:43.140
<i>Like, a game, a joke.</i>

30:43.142 --> 30:43.907
<i>To put people on blast,</i>

30:43.909 --> 30:45.442
<i>Basically.</i>

30:45.444 --> 30:46.610
<i>>> put people on blast?</i>

30:46.612 --> 30:48.979
<i>>> to get revenge on them or...?</i>

30:48.981 --> 30:50.347
<i>>> I wouldn't say revenge.</i>

30:50.349 --> 30:52.983
<i>Just mess with people.</i>

30:52.985 --> 30:53.650
<i>>> look.</i>

30:53.652 --> 30:54.351
<i>We just spent the last three</i>

30:54.353 --> 30:55.452
<i>Days talking to people whose</i>

30:55.454 --> 30:57.721
<i>Relationships and lives you've</i>

30:57.723 --> 30:59.223
<i>Ruined.</i>

30:59.225 --> 30:59.890
<i>>> yeah.</i>

30:59.892 --> 31:00.757
<i>>> like, a whole community, a</i>

31:00.759 --> 31:01.425
<i>Whole...</i>

31:01.427 --> 31:02.092
<i>>> yeah, I know.</i>

31:02.094 --> 31:02.759
<i>I know.</i>

31:02.761 --> 31:03.460
<i>>> my life too.</i>

31:03.462 --> 31:05.262
<i>>> yours--yeah, yours too.</i>

31:05.264 --> 31:06.530
<i>>> you made me lose trust with</i>

31:06.532 --> 31:07.564
<i>People.</i>

31:07.566 --> 31:08.498
<i>You made me break up</i>

31:08.500 --> 31:10.534
<i>Relationships that I have with</i>

31:10.536 --> 31:11.835
<i>Some of my closest friends.</i>

31:11.837 --> 31:13.604
<i>Even you, I thought was a close</i>

31:13.606 --> 31:15.405
<i>Friend of mine at the time.</i>

31:15.407 --> 31:16.306
<i>>> I was keeping it real with</i>

31:16.308 --> 31:20.043
<i>You about your friends.</i>

31:20.045 --> 31:21.445
<i>I really didn't feel bad.</i>

31:21.447 --> 31:22.846
<i>>> but none of those people did</i>

31:22.848 --> 31:24.348
<i>Anything to you, right?</i>

31:24.350 --> 31:29.019
<i>>> no, not really.</i>

31:29.021 --> 31:29.720
<i>>> you stabbed me in the heart</i>

31:29.722 --> 31:31.855
<i>Plenty of times, you know,</i>

31:31.857 --> 31:33.290
<i>Playing me.</i>

31:33.292 --> 31:34.758
<i>Lying to me.</i>

31:34.760 --> 31:36.560
<i>And I still stood by your side.</i>

31:36.562 --> 31:37.995
<i>>> yeah.</i>

31:37.997 --> 31:38.662
<i>No explanation for it.</i>

31:38.664 --> 31:39.363
<i>>> you've done some nasty</i>

31:39.365 --> 31:40.030
<i>[bleep].</i>

31:40.032 --> 31:40.697
<i>Like, why--</i>

31:40.699 --> 31:41.365
<i>>> yes, I know I have.</i>

31:41.367 --> 31:42.032
<i>>> well, what--there is an</i>

31:42.034 --> 31:43.533
<i>Explanation for it somewhere.</i>

31:43.535 --> 31:44.434
<i>>> okay.</i>

31:44.436 --> 31:45.869
<i>>> what is, like--</i>

31:45.871 --> 31:47.170
<i>>> I truthfully just did it--I</i>

31:47.172 --> 31:50.340
<i>Don't--it just got out of hand.</i>

31:50.342 --> 31:51.141
<i>I did it for fun.</i>

31:51.143 --> 31:52.476
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

31:52.478 --> 31:53.310
<i>>> so pretty much, it got you</i>

31:53.312 --> 31:56.780
<i>Off.</i>

31:56.782 --> 31:57.481
<i>>> did you have feelings for</i>

31:57.483 --> 31:59.416
<i>Craig?</i>

31:59.418 --> 32:04.721
<i>>> no.</i>

32:04.723 --> 32:09.593
<i>>> that was just a game.</i>

32:09.595 --> 32:12.029
<i>>> [chuckles]</i>

32:12.031 --> 32:14.231
<i>I mean...</i>

32:14.233 --> 32:14.965
<i>>> be real.</i>

32:14.967 --> 32:15.699
<i>>> yeah, kinda.</i>

32:15.701 --> 32:17.334
<i>I mean, but it goes...</i>

32:17.336 --> 32:19.069
<i>Both ways in this situation.</i>

32:19.071 --> 32:20.470
<i>It wasn't just all me now.</i>

32:20.472 --> 32:22.572
<i>The fake profile wasn't me.</i>

32:22.574 --> 32:24.474
<i>>> but it was you.</i>

32:24.476 --> 32:25.609
<i>At the end of the day, it was</i>

32:25.611 --> 32:29.513
<i>Cassandra.</i>

32:29.515 --> 32:31.048
<i>Several times when you're on the</i>

32:31.050 --> 32:31.882
<i>Phone, you know, you sit here</i>

32:31.884 --> 32:34.017
<i>And tell me that you want real</i>

32:34.019 --> 32:35.519
<i>Love.</i>

32:35.521 --> 32:37.087
<i>And I did everything in my power</i>

32:37.089 --> 32:40.290
<i>To give you just that...</i>

32:40.292 --> 32:41.458
<i>Just to be [bleep] on in the</i>

32:41.460 --> 32:43.727
<i>End.</i>

32:43.729 --> 32:45.829
<i>>> that's great.</i>

32:45.831 --> 32:48.065
<i>But it's just...</i>

32:48.067 --> 32:49.099
<i>>> you don't get it.</i>

32:49.101 --> 32:50.167
<i>I'm lookin' at you.</i>

32:50.169 --> 32:50.867
<i>I know you don't get it.</i>

32:50.869 --> 32:52.502
<i>>> look, whatever.</i>

32:52.504 --> 32:54.538
<i>I don't need this.</i>

33:18.430 --> 33:23.567
Tv show continues now.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.635
>> what do you make of

33:25.637 --> 33:26.837
Everything that happened with

33:26.839 --> 33:28.438
Cassandra?

33:28.440 --> 33:29.373
>> last night, you know, I

33:29.375 --> 33:31.441
Thought a lot about the

33:31.443 --> 33:32.743
Situation.

33:32.745 --> 33:34.544
I just want to open her eyes to,

33:34.546 --> 33:36.780
Like, look at the damage you're

33:36.782 --> 33:37.948
Causing people.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.049
If she takes it in, she takes it

33:39.051 --> 33:39.716
In.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.018
If she don't, she don't.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.786
But once I leave here, that's

33:42.788 --> 33:45.322
Where this is all staying.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.456
>> she's a bomb, right, that

33:46.458 --> 33:47.724
Kinda keeps on going off and

33:47.726 --> 33:48.959
Like, affecting everyone around

33:48.961 --> 33:49.760
Her.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.395
We gotta, like, try to dismantle

33:51.397 --> 33:52.696
The bomb.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.197
>> let's text her now.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.065
Let her know that we're on our

33:55.067 --> 33:57.534
Way.

33:57.536 --> 34:10.447
>> hey.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.581
>> both: Hello.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.382
>> hi.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.851
You all wanna come in?

34:14.853 --> 34:15.619
>> all right, so we're just

34:15.621 --> 34:17.454
Gonna let you and craig talk

34:17.456 --> 34:18.121
For a minute.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.456
>> okay.

34:20.458 --> 34:34.603
I'm sorry for lying to you.

34:34.606 --> 34:35.472
I mean, I guess I just didn't

34:35.474 --> 34:37.306
Tell you because I already knew

34:37.309 --> 34:38.408
How it was gonna play out, so I

34:38.409 --> 34:39.976
Just didn't tell you.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.012
>> what you're telling me, if it

34:42.014 --> 34:43.547
Came out to be you, it wouldn't

34:43.549 --> 34:45.181
Have been a relationship, right?

34:45.184 --> 34:46.083
>> I guess, yeah.

34:46.085 --> 34:46.949
>> and do you believe it

34:46.952 --> 34:48.217
Would've been a friendship at

34:48.219 --> 34:50.687
Least?

34:50.688 --> 34:51.621
>> no.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.556
>> no, you don't.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.523
But, see, that's where you're

34:53.525 --> 34:58.261
Wrong.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.129
I mean, you've got some issues

34:59.131 --> 35:00.464
Of your own that I can't help

35:00.466 --> 35:01.631
You with.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.299
I tried for a year and three

35:02.301 --> 35:03.700
Months.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.801
>> I mean, my issues are fine

35:04.803 --> 35:05.869
Now.

35:05.871 --> 35:06.703
>> you've got more issues than

35:06.705 --> 35:08.105
Just this.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.573
That's why you are the way you

35:09.575 --> 35:10.607
Are.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.843
>> please tell me how I am then.

35:12.845 --> 35:13.810
>> you impersonated someone

35:13.812 --> 35:15.579
Else, and you ruined several

35:15.581 --> 35:17.080
People's lives, and I don't

35:17.082 --> 35:21.017
Think you fully get it.

35:21.019 --> 35:22.352
>> you want answers, but it just

35:22.354 --> 35:24.387
Doesn't matter.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.823
It doesn't matter.

35:26.825 --> 35:34.631
>> what's going on?

35:34.633 --> 35:35.398
>> there's really no need to

35:35.400 --> 35:38.568
Pursue anything.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.936
The damage is done.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.904
>> if there's nothing else that

35:40.906 --> 35:41.571
You guys need to say to each

35:41.573 --> 35:42.339
Other...

35:42.341 --> 35:43.273
>> say good-bye.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.876
>> yeah.

35:45.878 --> 35:46.776
>> all right, we're gonna now

35:46.778 --> 35:50.947
Sit and talk.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.149
>> why am I so nice?

35:52.151 --> 35:53.550
I broke it to her easy.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.284
I should've broke it to her

35:54.286 --> 35:56.486
Hard.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.088
>> when we got to pittsburgh to

35:58.090 --> 36:01.224
Meet craig, he told us how much

36:01.226 --> 36:02.292
He loved you.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.493
He said, no matter what, he

36:03.495 --> 36:05.529
Wanted to pursue a friendship.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.596
And then, over the course of the

36:06.598 --> 36:08.331
Last few days, kind of realizing

36:08.333 --> 36:09.833
The full extent of what you did,

36:09.835 --> 36:15.172
He said he really disliked you.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.173
And it was just a shame because

36:16.175 --> 36:17.974
He was on the verge of saying,

36:17.976 --> 36:18.842
"you know what, this girl has

36:18.844 --> 36:21.912
Problems, but I wanna help her."

36:21.914 --> 36:22.879
>> he's gone.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.880
He made his decision.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.815
But I really don't care if we

36:25.817 --> 36:27.217
Have no communication.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.019
I don't.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.187
>> the fact that you're here

36:30.189 --> 36:32.389
Doing this means that there's

36:32.391 --> 36:34.891
Some part of you that wants to

36:34.893 --> 36:36.059
Change.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.961
>> [sighs]

36:37.963 --> 36:38.795
But, I mean, the first thing is

36:38.797 --> 36:44.000
Just being honest about it.

36:44.002 --> 36:44.834
>> well, I think you've gotta be

36:44.836 --> 36:45.869
Honest with yourself about why

36:45.871 --> 36:48.338
You did it.

36:48.340 --> 36:52.309
>> um...

36:52.311 --> 36:53.643
I sit here, you know, try to act

36:53.645 --> 36:57.013
All tough, you know, things like

36:57.015 --> 37:02.786
That, but...

37:02.788 --> 37:04.087
>> it's not really you.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.223
>> no, no, it's not me.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.023
You know, I used to get bullied

37:07.025 --> 37:10.760
A lot, like, real bad, you know.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.661
I guess I just know how people

37:11.663 --> 37:14.231
Can get so mean, and I just did

37:14.233 --> 37:15.131
It back.

37:15.133 --> 37:16.366
I don't know.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.701
I guess in a way, it felt good,

37:17.703 --> 37:19.035
You know.

37:19.037 --> 37:24.007
[cries]

37:24.009 --> 37:24.841
I guess it was the fact there

37:24.843 --> 37:28.545
Was no one I could turn to.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.347
I even tell myself, you know,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.148
Like, "what's the point of being

37:32.150 --> 37:33.783
Here, you know?"

37:33.785 --> 37:34.517
>> did you ever try to hurt

37:34.519 --> 37:35.685
Yourself?

37:35.687 --> 37:41.358
>> [cries]

37:41.360 --> 37:42.092
You know, I've thought about

37:42.094 --> 37:45.161
Killing myself, like, a few

37:45.163 --> 37:47.063
Times.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.100
[cries]

37:50.102 --> 37:51.835
>> I don't think that's a future

37:51.837 --> 37:55.238
You envisioned for yourself.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.573
But if you don't let yourself

37:56.575 --> 37:58.642
Feel what it means to lose

37:58.644 --> 38:00.977
Friends, then you're never gonna

38:00.979 --> 38:02.145
Really appreciate what it means

38:02.147 --> 38:04.614
To have friends.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.016
>> yeah.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.018

Go.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.026
I watched you do it.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.627
This is, in my opinion, the real

38:17.629 --> 38:19.696
Person.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.131
So if you would just try and be

38:21.133 --> 38:23.533
This more, I think you would be

38:23.535 --> 38:25.435
Shocked at the response that you

38:25.437 --> 38:26.303
Get.

38:26.305 --> 38:34.944
