<i> Previously, on Siren...</i>

00:03.896 --> 00:05.229
We are the most evolved
species on the planet.

00:05.231 --> 00:06.731
We were put here
to protect the earth.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.065
That cannot be left
in the hands of humans.

00:08.067 --> 00:11.736
Today, I doubled my dosage
of aquatic stem cells.

00:11.738 --> 00:12.345
<i> What are the limits?</i>

00:13.998 --> 00:15.348
[Maddie]
Ben, how did you do that?

00:15.424 --> 00:18.017
You were down there almost
15 minutes with no air tank.

00:18.094 --> 00:20.427
-[Ben] <i> That's Hope? </i>
<i> </i> -[Ryn] <i> She has grown.</i>

00:20.504 --> 00:23.097
<i> There's so much I've missed.</i>

00:23.173 --> 00:24.506
This is the safest place
in Bristol Cove.

00:24.584 --> 00:27.585
-I should go with you.
-The ranch has full security.

00:27.587 --> 00:28.602
We will not leave her side.

00:28.679 --> 00:31.105
[Ryn]
<i> Tia, she cannot be trusted.</i>

00:31.181 --> 00:31.922
She's stronger than any
I've ever seen.

00:31.924 --> 00:32.757
Stronger than me.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.683
She got in here undetected.

00:34.761 --> 00:37.945
-What exactly did she take?
-She deleted an audio file.

00:38.022 --> 00:39.521
The recording
of your echo chamber.

00:39.599 --> 00:40.931
And without that recording,
there's no cure.

00:40.933 --> 00:44.377
[Robb] <i> Eva told us</i>
<i> to destroy the echo chamber.</i>

00:44.453 --> 00:45.711
What if Robb's people
have a place like that

00:45.788 --> 00:47.362
<i> in their territory?</i>

00:47.440 --> 00:49.031
[Maddie]
<i> It's a sound weapon.</i>

00:49.108 --> 00:51.217
It's coming in
as an emergency call.

00:51.294 --> 00:52.459
You have to tell everyone
don't answer it, OK?

00:52.536 --> 00:53.201
Do not answer the phone.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.279
It's a terrorist attack.

00:55.281 --> 00:56.463
[Ted]
It's one of them again.

00:56.540 --> 00:57.223
OK, now do you see
how dangerous they are?

00:57.300 --> 00:58.891
She's polluting your life.

01:03.122 --> 01:04.955
What the hell
have you done to him?

01:04.957 --> 01:06.457

What's going on?
What's going on?

01:07.551 --> 01:09.126
He just suddenly
just passed out.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.903
Pulse is at 23.
He's gone into a coma.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.388
Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?

01:13.466 --> 01:14.465
Tia wants what she wants.

I'm so sorry.

03:38.945 --> 03:39.960

03:44.116 --> 03:45.282
I know you did.

03:45.284 --> 03:48.118
[Helen] I thought Hunter
could be trusted.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.211
I thought she was one of us.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.789
So did I.

03:51.791 --> 03:52.973
I would not
have left Hope with her.

03:55.644 --> 03:56.185
Tia has her now.

04:03.469 --> 04:05.727
Seattle's been hit.
Portland, too.

-Got all the tech set up there.
-Tia, the one who is doing this,

No, not yet. I'm sorry.
But there is someone here

He said it was urgent.

04:43.526 --> 04:45.175
Maddie.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.619
I came as soon I could.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.029
It's chaos.
They shut down the airports.

04:49.106 --> 04:50.605
The roads are blocked.

04:50.683 --> 04:53.350
She said your dad's missing.

04:53.352 --> 04:54.076
We found his truck.
Phone was in there, too.

04:56.355 --> 04:59.965
Hey, Yura went down to our
echo chamber like you asked

05:00.042 --> 05:01.616
and recorded the voices.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.043
You think this can cure it?

I don't know.
I don't know. We hope so.

Hey, hey, look, OK.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.457
We've got to try.

When they find your dad,
we'll be ready.

05:12.538 --> 05:14.629
Thank you.

Look, my friend Xander,
he's in the hospital.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.651
-We should try it on him.
-Of course.

-OK.
-Let's go.

-Sylvia, she collapsed.

I've got six workers in here.
What the hell's going on?

05:33.242 --> 05:35.150
I told you.
We're under attack.

-Is that what I saw
on your skin?
-No.

05:37.063 --> 05:37.895
Well, what is it, then?
What's happening?

05:37.897 --> 05:39.563
Dad, I can't explain right now.

We need to try
and stop this.

05:52.244 --> 05:53.468
[siren blaring]

05:56.173 --> 05:57.690
We're working on
restoring power to town,

05:57.766 --> 05:59.933
but we blocked cell service
to prevent further attacks.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.194
This is bigger
than we thought.

06:02.271 --> 06:04.179
How much have you told
the government

06:04.256 --> 06:05.939
about what's going on?

06:06.016 --> 06:08.534
-The President's been briefed.
-You told him who she is?

06:08.611 --> 06:11.762
He knows she's a terrorist.
That's all.

06:11.764 --> 06:11.870
Don't need him
tweeting this shit.

06:20.773 --> 06:22.039
She's gonna be OK.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.551
We're gonna get her back.

06:37.289 --> 06:38.847
[Tia] I know you don't
understand any of this.

06:40.793 --> 06:42.550
But you will.

06:42.628 --> 06:43.736
Someday.

06:45.481 --> 06:47.481
Everything I'm doing
is for you.

06:47.557 --> 06:48.857
The children.

06:51.637 --> 06:52.819
You're the future.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.661
I almost had one like you.

07:00.737 --> 07:04.072
When the humans captured me,

07:04.150 --> 07:05.424
I was pregnant.

07:05.501 --> 07:06.925
Close to giving birth.

07:09.079 --> 07:10.596
They treated me very badly.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.842
And I lost my child.

07:19.665 --> 07:24.935
There is no greater pain
than a mother losing her baby.

07:39.776 --> 07:40.951
[grunts]

07:46.375 --> 07:47.082
You should learn
to behave.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.618
When I'm finished,

07:50.696 --> 07:51.461
you're gonna need
a mother.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.973
[indistinct chattering]

08:18.891 --> 08:21.758
[Lim] Look at how the governor
worded this statement.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.409
It's vague.
There's more going on.

08:22.486 --> 08:24.336
What is it?

08:24.413 --> 08:25.162
I don't know.

08:32.071 --> 08:34.513

08:42.672 --> 08:44.339
Can we broadcast this?

08:44.416 --> 08:45.749
If it's real,
can we afford not to?

08:45.751 --> 08:48.360
-Anyone on with the FBI?
-I'm trying to get through.

08:48.437 --> 08:50.696
Who else has this?

08:50.773 --> 08:52.364
-What do we know about her?
-Uhh-- Nothing.

Zero digital footprint.

08:53.776 --> 08:56.535
Excuse me.

08:56.612 --> 08:59.096
I just got a call
from my friend in Seoul.

08:59.098 --> 09:00.688
Their newsroom
got one, too.

09:00.766 --> 09:02.157
She's speaking Korean
in theirs.

09:06.622 --> 09:08.622
She sent the manifesto
to different countries,
all in their own language.

09:08.698 --> 09:12.626
In each one, she implicates
a different foreign power
in the attacks.

09:12.702 --> 09:15.279
-What is she doing?
-She's trying to create havoc,
make us all blame each other.

09:15.281 --> 09:18.465
Her plan was to destroy a few
thousand people with her weapon,

09:18.542 --> 09:19.874
let us do the rest.

09:19.952 --> 09:22.895
[officer] Lieutenant,

managed to ping through
a firewall in Whatcom County,
near Bellingham.

09:25.307 --> 09:28.216
The activity matches our target,
and we've narrowed it to about
50 square miles.

09:28.294 --> 09:31.311
I need a hard target search
of the entire area.

09:31.388 --> 09:35.390
-We need to go door to door.
-[Anderson] No, it's gonna take
too long.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.650
What we need is something
more immediate.

09:36.726 --> 09:37.467
Her body temperature's
92 degrees.

09:37.469 --> 09:40.728
Excuse me?

09:40.806 --> 09:43.064
We can use thermal imaging
to track her down.

09:43.142 --> 09:44.082
We've done it before,
to find Ryn.

09:49.832 --> 09:51.406

It's not working.

09:51.483 --> 09:52.833

down at the hospital.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.124
<i> Ted, did something</i>

10:43.202 --> 10:45.477
He wasn't affected
by the attack.

10:45.554 --> 10:48.722
But, uh...
I guess he found

10:48.798 --> 10:50.040
some of the stem cells

10:50.042 --> 10:51.266
from your treatment,
and, um...

I don't know,
he wanted to test them

10:54.563 --> 10:55.320

11:44.596 --> 11:47.039
-Just like old times, huh?
-[groans]

11:47.115 --> 11:48.356
Except it was usually me
that needed the help.

11:48.434 --> 11:50.358
-It worked.
-We have to duplicate it.

11:50.436 --> 11:51.209
Get a copy to everyone else
who needs it.

11:51.286 --> 11:52.769
Right.

11:52.771 --> 11:54.438
And I need to get a copy
to Lieutenant Maeda.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.364
They can distribute it to the
other cities that were hit.

11:56.442 --> 11:57.215
Yeah.

12:05.117 --> 12:06.466
[beeping]

12:13.292 --> 12:14.624
That's got to be her.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.051
-Lock down those coordinates.
-[officer] Yes, sir.

12:17.129 --> 12:19.479
[Maeda]
Initiate Black Ops.
We have a location.

12:19.556 --> 12:20.555
Maybe she has Hope there.

12:20.632 --> 12:21.389
Let's go.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.241
We're going with you.

12:28.231 --> 12:29.639
Takes about two hours
for the full effect.

12:29.641 --> 12:31.917
Are you sure this works?

12:31.994 --> 12:33.401
We just used it
on our friend.

12:33.479 --> 12:36.571
He was the first patient
to arrive here, and he's better.

12:36.648 --> 12:39.165
Chief of Medicine
has signed off on this,

12:39.242 --> 12:40.650
but check with Dr. Riley
if you need to.

12:40.652 --> 12:41.818
Right. We need
all the devices,

12:41.820 --> 12:42.928
tablets, headphones you can get,

12:43.005 --> 12:43.503
and we'll download it onto them.

12:43.580 --> 12:44.587
Please.

12:46.825 --> 12:47.933
I need to go.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.601
-Your father?
-Yeah.

12:49.678 --> 12:52.329
They're looking for him, dear.
You'll be more of a help here.

12:52.331 --> 12:55.923
-They're gonna find him.
-[Xander] What happened to Dale?

12:56.001 --> 12:58.259
Back into bed, Xander.
You need to rest.

12:58.337 --> 13:00.837
-Where is he? Maddie?
-He's missing, Xander.

13:00.839 --> 13:02.114
I found his truck
out by Libbey Beach.

13:02.190 --> 13:04.858
-OK, I'm going out there.
-You're in no condition.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.434
Look, I'll be fine.

13:06.512 --> 13:07.360
All right? Just...

13:09.014 --> 13:10.530
You stay here.

13:10.607 --> 13:11.939
You finish
helping these people.

13:12.017 --> 13:14.684
I'm gonna go get Marissa,
and we'll find your dad.

13:14.686 --> 13:16.611
-OK?
-OK.

13:16.688 --> 13:18.463
Thank you.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.122
Everything's gonna be OK.

13:22.878 --> 13:25.128
You have no idea
what it's like out there.

13:28.383 --> 13:30.976
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea,
actually.

13:31.053 --> 13:32.794
You don't know
how many more are missing.

13:32.871 --> 13:34.220
Like Dale,
God knows where.

13:34.297 --> 13:37.390
Yeah, and then we'll keep
searching until we find them.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.209
Well, you're gonna need
a shit-ton of help.

13:39.211 --> 13:40.310
And I know
where to get it.

13:42.138 --> 13:43.480
[tires squeal]

13:50.889 --> 13:52.072
[indistinct radio chatter]

13:59.731 --> 14:01.081
-Clear.
- <i> Contact, move in.</i>

14:03.251 --> 14:04.584
Go! Go!

14:04.661 --> 14:05.418
[beeping]

14:09.074 --> 14:10.423
That's Tia?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.424
I'm not sure.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.095
What if it's Hope?

14:15.171 --> 14:16.021
Hey, hey! Hey, Ryn?

14:16.098 --> 14:19.099
Ryn! Wait!

14:19.175 --> 14:20.358
Ryn!

14:22.104 --> 14:23.195
Clear.

14:25.607 --> 14:26.364
North stairwell, clear.

14:28.427 --> 14:29.776
Hallway, clear.

14:31.688 --> 14:33.763
[radio crackling]

14:33.765 --> 14:34.856
-[guns cock]
-Fourth corridor, clear.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.600
Contact! Contact!

14:36.602 --> 14:38.159
[officer]
Confirmed containment.

14:40.697 --> 14:42.330
-Stand by, team.
-Turn around! Hands up!

14:50.616 --> 14:52.132
[panting]

14:59.808 --> 15:01.558
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[door opens]

15:03.629 --> 15:04.519
[door closes]

15:07.983 --> 15:11.067
Hello? Anyone in here?

15:12.804 --> 15:15.822
Xander, you're OK.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.749
-Where is everyone?
-All my officers,

15:17.826 --> 15:19.476
either down
or out looking for victims.

15:19.478 --> 15:22.403
-Sheriff Bishop's missing, too.
-Yeah, I heard.

15:22.481 --> 15:24.089
-But you're better?
-[Calvin] There's a cure.

15:24.166 --> 15:27.000
Maddie's got it. They're using
it at the hospital right now.

15:27.076 --> 15:28.485
[Xander] There could be
more people affected.

15:28.487 --> 15:29.669
We got to find them
before it's too late.

15:29.746 --> 15:31.412
How? We're tapped, Xander.

15:31.490 --> 15:32.505
There's nobody else.

15:32.582 --> 15:33.882
[Helen]
Actually, there is.

15:39.998 --> 15:42.274
And another 40 of us outside.
Just tell us what you need.

15:44.093 --> 15:46.836
OK. Yes.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.596
Thank you.

15:48.674 --> 15:51.007
All right,
we'll divide into teams,

15:51.009 --> 15:52.951
spread out,
check every vehicle,

15:53.028 --> 15:54.769
house, any structure
you can find.

15:54.846 --> 15:56.103
-Where do you want me?
-Go down to the docks.

15:56.181 --> 15:58.014
-Check for people
on their boats.
-All right.

15:58.016 --> 16:00.183
OK, we're gonna need a place

16:00.185 --> 16:01.201
to take victims
when we find them.

16:01.277 --> 16:02.702
The hospital doesn't have
enough beds.

16:02.779 --> 16:04.037
-I'm on it.
-OK.

16:06.374 --> 16:08.133
You and me,

16:08.210 --> 16:10.360
we're gonna go
find the sheriff.

16:10.362 --> 16:12.304
Where is she?

16:12.380 --> 16:13.530
What did you do
with my daughter?

16:13.532 --> 16:15.623
It was Tia.

16:15.701 --> 16:17.625
No. You took her.

16:17.703 --> 16:19.052
-You chose to betray.
-She would kill me.

16:24.376 --> 16:25.800
She took her to the water.

16:25.877 --> 16:28.987
The place where
we hide our weapons.

16:29.064 --> 16:31.323
-The old airplane?
-[Hunter] Yes.

16:31.399 --> 16:32.899
She wants you to go there.

16:34.978 --> 16:36.553
[Ben]
It's a trap, Ryn.

16:36.555 --> 16:37.329
She's waiting for you.

16:39.391 --> 16:40.323
Good.

16:44.563 --> 16:46.246
[gasps]

16:46.322 --> 16:49.733
If my daughter dies
because of you,

16:49.735 --> 16:51.084
you will know her pain.

17:00.078 --> 17:01.578
Have you seen what's going on?
We're being attacked.

17:01.580 --> 17:05.006
Not just this town,
the entire Pacific Northwest.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.099
They're saying
it's the Russians,

17:06.175 --> 17:07.692
but we know the truth,
don't we?

17:07.769 --> 17:10.362
[Helen]
There's a cure.

17:10.438 --> 17:12.272
I've seen it work on Xander.

17:12.348 --> 17:14.424
-Well, thank God for that.
-The problem is,

17:14.426 --> 17:15.925
there's more victims than
the hospital can handle.

17:15.927 --> 17:18.519
What do you want
from me?

17:18.597 --> 17:20.280
We need somewhere to bring them,
treat them.

17:20.356 --> 17:22.098
And you've got the biggest
place in town.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.116
You want to use
the warehouse?

17:23.192 --> 17:24.993
Yeah.

17:27.272 --> 17:29.272
Does the government
even know the truth?

17:29.274 --> 17:30.790
It just keeps escalating.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.367
What about the one
who started all this?
Where the hell is she?

17:33.445 --> 17:36.221
Let's just worry about our own
little town for now, Ted.

17:40.543 --> 17:41.384
Yeah, all right.

17:43.638 --> 17:44.896
Come on, let's go.
I'll take you there.

17:44.973 --> 17:46.139
[wind gusting]

18:39.694 --> 18:40.452
[motor powers down]

18:42.864 --> 18:43.279
[Ryn]
This is the place.

18:45.108 --> 18:47.942
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

18:48.019 --> 18:49.285
She's down there.
I feel her.

18:53.024 --> 18:54.874
[Ben] Ryn, to just go
straight in there...

18:54.951 --> 18:56.134
we need to think about
what we're doing.

18:56.211 --> 18:57.302
I have.

18:57.379 --> 19:00.955
She's expecting me
to come for my daughter.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.474
-Exactly.
-But she won't be expecting you.

19:05.203 --> 19:06.886
That's true.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.295
You say you are
still changing.

19:08.373 --> 19:10.540
Even without the cells.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.432
You can go deep?

19:13.728 --> 19:14.268
Honestly, I don't know
what I can do.

19:17.883 --> 19:20.808
Let's find out.

19:20.886 --> 19:24.721
I will lead Tia
and the others away.

19:24.723 --> 19:27.648
And once they're gone,
you will free Hope.

19:27.726 --> 19:28.816
You can't lead them away.

19:28.894 --> 19:30.076
They'll kill you.

19:31.579 --> 19:33.396
If I die,

19:33.398 --> 19:34.747
it is so my daughter
can live.

19:49.505 --> 19:52.932
You know, I've been having
dreams about the three of us,

19:53.009 --> 19:54.851
living together as a family.

19:59.849 --> 20:01.190
I like this dream.

20:04.596 --> 20:05.820
I want it, too.

20:15.273 --> 20:17.123
Right here.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.217
If we set up a network,
it'll link them together.

20:19.294 --> 20:21.461
It'll load faster.

20:21.537 --> 20:23.279
-You know how to do that?
-Yeah, for sure.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.338
Yeah, let's do it.
How can we help?

20:27.469 --> 20:29.285
Your people are helping.

20:29.287 --> 20:30.636
They were immune
to the attack.

20:30.713 --> 20:31.545
They're happy to help, Ted.

20:31.623 --> 20:33.222
It's their town, too.

20:50.399 --> 20:51.916
Hey.

20:51.993 --> 20:53.901
This is your boat?

20:53.979 --> 20:55.903
Yeah.

20:55.981 --> 20:57.038
We need your boat.

20:59.075 --> 21:02.485
OK. For what?

21:02.487 --> 21:03.820
To go on the water.
For Ryn.

21:03.822 --> 21:05.671
For Hope.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.173
We help fight.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.415
[Calvin] I hate to state
the obvious here,

21:08.493 --> 21:10.417
but, uh, can't you guys just
swim out there?

21:10.495 --> 21:11.828
-I mean...
-It is better from above.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.830
From boat.

21:13.832 --> 21:16.666
Ah.

21:16.668 --> 21:19.093
OK, so like a surprise
attack kind of thing?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.895
Hell, yeah. Let's do it.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.616
[engine revs]

22:09.237 --> 22:11.162
[Marissa] His last call-in
was eight hours ago.

22:11.239 --> 22:12.572
[sighs]

22:12.648 --> 22:14.982
[Xander] Maybe somebody
found him, picked him up.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.492
Hey, look at that.

22:19.155 --> 22:20.162
[Xander]
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

22:21.733 --> 22:22.507
[brakes squeal]

22:26.087 --> 22:27.169
Hey, you OK?

22:32.577 --> 22:33.351
Are you hurt?

22:39.175 --> 22:40.182
[Xander]
She's alive!

22:46.608 --> 22:49.683
Hey, buddy.

22:49.761 --> 22:50.684
Your mom's gonna be OK,
all right?

22:50.762 --> 22:53.096
We've got a treatment for her.

22:53.098 --> 22:53.871
We're going to take her
there right now.

22:53.948 --> 22:56.265
You want to--

22:56.267 --> 22:57.191
You want to go for a ride
in the police car?

22:57.268 --> 22:59.544
Yeah? All right.

22:59.621 --> 23:00.786
What about the man?

23:03.032 --> 23:05.699
-What man?
-The policeman.

23:05.777 --> 23:06.959
He's sick, too.

23:09.964 --> 23:11.556
-Where is he?
-He went in there.

23:19.457 --> 23:20.514
Take him to Pownall Seafood.

23:23.219 --> 23:24.644
Keep your radio on.

23:28.816 --> 23:30.316
Come on.

23:48.987 --> 23:50.169
[shrieks]

24:55.737 --> 24:56.569
Yeah, right here.
Look at this.

25:00.058 --> 25:00.948
[sighs]
Hey.

25:04.987 --> 25:05.953
I was wrong.

25:07.899 --> 25:09.248
About a lot of things.

25:14.088 --> 25:14.679
We're all in this
together, Ted.

25:17.575 --> 25:18.299
Yeah.

25:24.673 --> 25:26.307
[inaudible]

25:28.086 --> 25:30.344
Um-- Keep it playing.

25:30.421 --> 25:31.587
He might get disoriented
when he wakes up.

25:31.589 --> 25:32.772
OK.

25:37.686 --> 25:39.320
Don't worry,
your mom's gonna be safe now.

25:41.616 --> 25:42.765
We found her on the county road,

25:42.767 --> 25:44.191
not far from Libbey Beach.

25:44.269 --> 25:45.526
You and Xander?

25:45.603 --> 25:46.786
Yeah.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.771
The boy said
he saw somebody

25:48.773 --> 25:50.273
wandering into the forest.

25:50.275 --> 25:52.383
A police officer.

25:52.460 --> 25:53.959
Xander's out there
looking for him.

26:05.957 --> 26:07.231
No, no, no, no, no.

26:07.308 --> 26:09.225
No, no, no.

27:09.778 --> 27:10.870

27:33.378 --> 27:35.227
[high-pitched squeals
and grunting]

27:45.056 --> 27:46.146
Here you go. Take it slow.

27:46.224 --> 27:47.981
[man]
Son!

27:48.059 --> 27:49.992
You made it.

27:53.731 --> 27:54.955
We're gonna be OK.

27:57.919 --> 27:59.902
[knock on door]

27:59.904 --> 28:01.679
Coffee?

28:01.756 --> 28:03.664
[sighs]
Thanks.

28:03.741 --> 28:05.241
Thank you, Ted.

28:05.243 --> 28:06.350
You've helped
