00:28.040 --> 00:30.320
Just chill.
It's no big deal.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.200
But it's bugging me.
I can't stand it.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.120
Me neither. Don't you
ever change clothes?

00:35.120 --> 00:38.080
No. Don't you ever
mind your own business?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.800
Both: Ooh.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.160
What's the problem?

00:44.160 --> 00:45.520
I'm going nuts

00:45.520 --> 00:48.160
'cause I was going to
tell you guys something,

00:48.160 --> 00:49.920
and I can't remember
what it is.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.080
If you stop trying
to remember, you will.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.000
That's sort of what
my story's about.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.400
What, Tucker going
out of his mind?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.600
No. About memories.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.480
But not any memories--

01:01.480 --> 01:03.240
it's about
the kind we share.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.960
These are things that inspired
some of my stories.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.040
This is my grandmother's.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.960
<i>It helped me come with The Tale
of the Long-Ago Locket.</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
And this is
my brother's school ring.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.920
<i>It helped create
The Tale of the Dream Girl.</i>

01:22.920 --> 01:24.960
And this--

01:24.960 --> 01:26.200
<i> Watcher's Woods.</i>

01:26.200 --> 01:27.480
<i> Watcher's Woods-- exactly.</i>

01:27.480 --> 01:29.000
And that's my point--

01:29.000 --> 01:31.960
a lot of memories
are shared.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.960
We look at this stuff
and we think of the same things.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.240
That's important,
because it brings us together

01:38.240 --> 01:39.640
as friends.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.560
But can you imagine if we
didn't have these memories?

01:47.040 --> 01:50.000
It would be
like we had no past

01:50.000 --> 01:51.640
and no friends,

01:51.640 --> 01:56.840
and the future would be
just as empty and lonely.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.960
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:01.960 --> 02:03.680
I call this story...

02:23.280 --> 02:25.200
Sam: Jason
and his sister Lisa

02:25.200 --> 02:27.400
were real happy
their mom quit her job

02:27.400 --> 02:29.480
to start her own business.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.440
That is, until they found out
what and where

02:34.440 --> 02:36.600
that business was going to be.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.280
You dragged us a million
miles from civilization

02:39.280 --> 02:41.520
and our friends for this?

02:42.560 --> 02:45.280
You haven't seen
the good part yet.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.520
Ho, ho. Just wait
till you see this.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.720
Ta-da!

03:04.200 --> 03:08.160
Ah, well.
Isn't it just heaven?

03:08.160 --> 03:09.320
I don't know.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.360
Is heaven a place
where nothing happens?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.920
Oh, I think it's great.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.240
It used to be called
Homestead Inn.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
This was a happening
place once

03:28.240 --> 03:30.280
and we are going
to bring it back.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.000
I've got a contractor
lined up

03:32.000 --> 03:34.480
and I've got a meeting
with the bank.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.760
Think we could make it
back to the city in this?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.880
No one's going anywhere
in that.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.920
I want you to stay
off the dock

03:42.920 --> 03:44.400
till we get you
a life jacket.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.920
Mom?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.280
Hey, you're the one that
didn't want swimming lessons.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.640
Hey, don't look at me.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.800
Oh, come on, guys,
this is our big chance.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.760
We can have our own business
and be our own bosses.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.080
It's gonna be great.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.680
Come on, what do you
say, are you with me?

Where do you
want this one, boss?

04:26.680 --> 04:29.280
Uh, oh, it doesn't
matter. Anywhere.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.720
Aw, it's stuck.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.880
Here, let me try.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.840
That's weird.
It's not locked.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.640
Yeah, so then why
won't it open?

04:47.640 --> 04:49.120
Whoa!

04:49.120 --> 04:50.160
Look out!

04:55.880 --> 04:59.360
What'd you say about this place
just needing a coat of paint

04:59.360 --> 05:00.680
and some elbow grease?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.040

05:59.880 --> 06:01.480
Did you hear that music?

06:01.480 --> 06:02.480
No, what music?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.400
It came from down there.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.920
I don't know
what it was.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.360
Maybe it was the
sound of the waves--

06:14.120 --> 06:15.320
Lisa?

06:16.640 --> 06:19.520
Lisa, what's up?

06:19.520 --> 06:21.520
Can't you hear the music?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.280
Told you.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.200
Sweetheart...

06:31.480 --> 06:33.240
Sweetheart,
let's go back to bed.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.240
But it sounded so nice.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.720
OK, come on.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.080
There's a bunch of nothing
back here.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.160
Maybe not.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.000
What is it?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.960
A jukebox, an old one.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.160
Is this where the music
came from?

07:11.800 --> 07:12.760
I doubt it.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.200
Do you think it works?

07:14.200 --> 07:17.320
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.200
Oh, whoa.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.360
Wow.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.120
OK, here we go. A-2?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.920
Sure.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.840
It works.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.520
[Swing music plays]

07:39.520 --> 07:41.880
Oh, listen to that.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.120
It sounds really
old-fashioned.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.600
Yeah. It must bring back
a lot of memories, huh, mom?

07:52.600 --> 07:55.600
Hey, I wasn't even born
when that came out,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.720
thank you very much.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.120
[Buzzing]

08:11.120 --> 08:12.200
Watch it!

08:16.440 --> 08:19.640
Well, so much
for the old movies.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.280
So much for the wiring.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.320
Oh, if it's bad, it'll cost a
fortune to re-wire this place.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.120
It's probably just
a loose connection.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.160
If we got more old stuff
like this,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.920
we could give the place
a retro feel.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.360
It might be cool.

08:34.360 --> 08:39.520
Cool? Did I hear something
positive for a change?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.960
It might be fun
to see how it all works.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.720

Let's leave Mr. Fixit alone,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.640
before he changes his mind.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.160
OK. OK.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.320
OK.

OK, B-5.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.080
All right.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.120
Now all we have to do

09:48.120 --> 09:50.600
is get some
half-decent records.

Jason, you've got
to stop doing that.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.120
Did you see that girl?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.600
What girl?

11:00.600 --> 11:03.400
She was right there. You
must have walked right by her.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.520
No one's here. You're not
getting strange on me, are you?

[door shuts]

12:23.480 --> 12:26.240
OK, Mom, what are you...

12:30.200 --> 12:33.720
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.960
She was right there,
I swear--

12:52.960 --> 12:54.280
the exact same girl.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.600
Maybe you were
sleepwalking.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.920
You did that when
you were little.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.600
How does sleepwalking make a
girl appear out of nowhere?

13:01.600 --> 13:04.200
The windows, please. And
we could do without talk

13:04.200 --> 13:05.840
about how this place
is haunted.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.440
Haunted? Here?

13:08.440 --> 13:13.600
Oh, no, honey. We don't
believe in ghosts, do we?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.320
Especially ones
that might devalue

13:15.320 --> 13:17.840
this prime piece
of real estate.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.520
When you're finished, I've got
some stuff for you to do upstairs.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.480
Sure, boss. Can't wait.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.320
Nothing like country living,
huh, Lis?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.880
Oh, no!

13:46.920 --> 13:49.280
Lisa! Lisa, stop!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.680
What do you think
you're doing?

13:52.680 --> 13:54.240
Mom's gonna kill you.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.840
Worse, she's gonna kill me.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.280
Didn't you hear?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.320
Hear what?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.360
The lady.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.600
What lady?

14:00.600 --> 14:04.560
In the canoe.
She's right out...

14:09.320 --> 14:10.440
She's gone.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.160
Come on.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.960
But she was out there.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.640
What'd she look like?

14:15.640 --> 14:19.120
Pretty.
She was singing a song.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.160
What kind of song?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.760
An old-fashioned one.

14:22.760 --> 14:28.200
She said he promised to dance
to it again, no matter what.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.640
And then
she started to cry.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.640
We better get this up and
docked before Mom sees.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.800
Too late.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.080
And I never want you down by the
water alone, do you understand?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.320
Yes.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.680
Keep a closer eye on
her while I am gone.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.000
Mom, she was talking
to a ghost.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.640
She has a vivid
imagination.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.240
Yeah, and I'm
a sleepwalker.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.240
Come on, Mom,
this is weird.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.600
Something's
really going on.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.240
Look, have you
any idea how much

15:00.240 --> 15:02.680
lake front property
like this normally costs?

15:02.680 --> 15:06.360
The only reason that I was
able to afford this place

15:06.360 --> 15:08.000
was because
of the stories.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.800
This place
really is haunted.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.800
No, it just
has a history.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.800
Oh, god,
I've got to go.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.240
My meeting's in less
than an hour.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.000
What kind of history?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.320
The real estate
agent

15:18.320 --> 15:20.280
told me the story,

15:20.280 --> 15:23.160
but it's just a story,
so don't tell Lisa, OK?

15:23.160 --> 15:24.720
I won't. Speak.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.080
OK. Just after
the second World War,

15:29.080 --> 15:32.760
they were getting ready to
throw a big welcome home party

15:32.760 --> 15:35.440
for a local boy who'd
been sent overseas.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.440
His girlfriend lived
across the lake,

15:37.440 --> 15:39.160
and she organized
the whole thing.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.160
But the night of the
party, they got a telegram

15:42.160 --> 15:44.040
saying the boy
wasn't coming back.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.920
Ooh. Sad.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.960
Yeah, it gets worse.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.120
There was a storm
that night,

15:50.120 --> 15:51.680
and his girlfriend's
canoe

15:51.680 --> 15:55.320
washed up
on the shore--empty.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.640
It's all so tragic.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.560
Lisa saw a girl in a canoe.
Maybe it's the ghost--

15:59.560 --> 16:00.920
Don't even say it.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.160
A lot of girls
paddle canoes.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.680
And sneak in here to play
records and disappear?

16:05.680 --> 16:08.600
Reality check. There are
no such things as ghosts,

16:08.600 --> 16:10.920
and I refuse to blow
this opportunity

16:10.920 --> 16:12.920
because of some
sad old story.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.680
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.680
Mom...

16:16.680 --> 16:18.000
I am sorry, honey.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.600
I'm sorry,
I don't believe it.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.400
OK, how about this one?

16:45.040 --> 16:49.640
Nope. You made me
lose my place.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.920
Come on, Lis,
just a few more.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.240
Who cares what song
she was singing?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.560
Well, maybe she does.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
I want to see
if it'll bring her back.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.400
How about this one?

17:01.440 --> 17:05.280
Something's stuck--
C-7. Hold on.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.510
OK.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.160
C-5, OK. C-6, OK.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.200
C-7...

17:17.480 --> 17:19.280
The thing that lifts it
is jammed.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.000
Hand me a screwdriver.

17:25.319 --> 17:28.040
Lis, you want to hand
me the... forget it.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.560
The storm.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.920
I have to warn her.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.680
OK. Got it.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.560
OK, Lis, hit C-7.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.440
Hit C-7, would you?

17:40.440 --> 17:41.720
Lisa?

17:46.520 --> 17:49.280
Lisa. Oh, no!

17:54.160 --> 17:57.440
Lisa! Lisa!

18:12.760 --> 18:15.000
Lake Shore police?
Yeah, it's an emergency.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.280
OK. My sister's out
on the lake.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.240
She's trying to find
this ghost of a woman

18:20.240 --> 18:22.000
in the canoe.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.760
Yeah, a ghost.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.400
She's been
haunting this place

18:29.400 --> 18:32.400
'cause her boyfriend
never came back from the war.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.040
No, this isn't a prank.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.640
Wait! Hello?

19:00.680 --> 19:03.160
I hope this is what you want.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.520
[Music plays]

19:36.000 --> 19:38.960
All: Surprise!

19:41.640 --> 19:43.200
All: Surprise!

19:44.960 --> 19:46.840
Tommy: It's so good
to be home.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.040
How've you been?

19:51.040 --> 19:52.440
Where's Iris?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.760
Did she wait for me?

20:00.320 --> 20:01.800
Where is she?

20:07.040 --> 20:07.760
Tommy?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.000
Excuse me, buddy.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.640
Oh, darling,
I've been waiting so long.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.240
I always said we'd dance
to our song again.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.600
Come on.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.800
Wait, wait.

21:25.680 --> 21:26.960
Thank you.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.880
[Gasps]

21:40.880 --> 21:44.440
We have got to stop scaring
each other like this.

21:44.440 --> 21:45.440
Mom!

21:48.400 --> 21:50.960
What--
but they were...

21:50.960 --> 21:51.960
What?

21:51.960 --> 21:53.600
Lisa.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.200
Jason, what's going on?

22:01.880 --> 22:05.480
Don't you dare tell me
she went out in that.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.520
Lisa!

22:07.520 --> 22:08.760
Lisa!

22:10.040 --> 22:11.960
You were supposed
to look after her!

22:11.960 --> 22:13.960
I told you
to look after her!

22:13.960 --> 22:16.080
She was right there,
Mom, I swear.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.440
Lisa!

22:17.440 --> 22:18.880
Lisa!

22:18.880 --> 22:19.880
Mom.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.040
Lisa, where have you been?

22:29.040 --> 22:32.040
It's OK. She told me
everything was all right,

22:32.040 --> 22:34.840
and then she brought me back.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.480
Who? What are you
talking about?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.400
The lady
and her boyfriend.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.680
They brought me
back to shore.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.480
It's getting cold.
Let's get inside, OK?

23:03.040 --> 23:05.480
You're welcome.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.400
Hey, I got a great idea
for this main room.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
We can make it
like a cafe or a bar,

23:10.400 --> 23:12.880
for weddings
and stuff like that.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.640
It'll be great.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.520
Nobody ever saw another ghost
around homestead inn,

23:19.520 --> 23:22.120
but Jason would always remember
Iris and Tommy,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.120
and the song
from their past

23:24.120 --> 23:26.240
that finally
brought them together.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.240
But memory was all he had,

23:28.240 --> 23:32.360
because after that night,
Jason could never get C-7

23:32.360 --> 23:33.960
to play again.

23:33.960 --> 23:34.840
[Thunder]

23:34.840 --> 23:36.120
That's it!

23:36.120 --> 23:37.680
What's it?

23:37.680 --> 23:39.240
The thing I couldn't
remember.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.840
There's a big storm
coming tonight.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.360
Now you remember?

23:42.360 --> 23:44.640
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight--

23:44.640 --> 23:47.360
[all talk at once]
