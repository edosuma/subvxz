00:17.359 --> 00:19.092
Not tonight!

00:19.194 --> 00:21.295
I wanted to deliver
the Oscars monologue.

00:21.397 --> 00:24.831
The Russian bots did their thing
and here I am!

00:24.933 --> 00:27.333
So many great movies this year.

00:27.435 --> 00:29.835
I watched "Get Out" sitting next
to Jeff Sessions.

00:29.937 --> 00:31.537
The guy wouldn't stop taking notes

00:31.539 --> 00:33.839
and smiling like he's in
a toothpaste commercial.

00:33.941 --> 00:36.409
You know, I actually didn't see
"Call Me by Your Name."

00:36.511 --> 00:39.745
If I wanted to see a lanky boy
get screwed on foreign soil,

00:39.847 --> 00:41.480
I'd hang out with Jared Kushner.

00:41.582 --> 00:43.949
I hope you're happy,
"Call Me by Your Name."

00:44.051 --> 00:45.850
Your trailer killed Billy Graham.

00:45.952 --> 00:47.585
I liked The "Shape of Water."

00:47.688 --> 00:49.188
That fish man had it all ...

00:49.189 --> 00:51.756
mute wife,
soaks in a bathtub all day.

00:51.858 --> 00:53.625
Doesn't wake up to exits
being widened

00:53.727 --> 00:57.029
- so staff can quit in groups.
- Oh.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.798
I'm gonna miss my ladybird
Hope Hicks.

00:59.899 --> 01:03.434
Anyways, huge fan of
Pixar's "Coco" or any movie

01:03.536 --> 01:06.403
about a bunch of singing
and dancing dead Mexicans.

01:06.505 --> 01:08.806
But no movie has been
more captivating

01:08.907 --> 01:11.375
than the one that we feel like
we can't wake up from ...

01:11.477 --> 01:13.077
my presidency.

01:13.078 --> 01:17.147
And I announced this week
that I'm running again in 2020.

01:17.249 --> 01:18.316
<i>[Woods] Whoo!</i>

01:18.317 --> 01:21.617
Thank you, James Woods.
Someone put James in a movie.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.220
"Bridesmaids" did for women

01:23.221 --> 01:25.421
what his next film
will do for dipshits!

01:25.523 --> 01:27.957
No.
Cast my wife, Louise Linton.

01:28.059 --> 01:30.660
She can play everything
from an upscale doorknob

01:30.762 --> 01:32.095
to a load-bearing column.

01:32.096 --> 01:36.164

What's this now?

02:59.045 --> 03:01.010
The state dinner.
We talked about this.

03:01.112 --> 03:03.780
- You're hosting it.
- I thought when I became President,

03:03.882 --> 03:06.884
I wouldn't have to listen
to anyone, including myself.

03:07.385 --> 03:09.853
So, this whole state dinner
should be, like,

03:09.955 --> 03:12.121
one of these walks in
the park I've read about.

03:12.223 --> 03:13.257
And Trudeau ...

03:13.258 --> 03:14.958
he's not even
President of Canada.

03:15.060 --> 03:18.027
Whose coffee do you have to
screw up to become Prime Minister?

03:18.028 --> 03:20.262
Sir, I think we should
take this more seriously.

03:20.364 --> 03:22.431
This will strengthen
the bond that we'll need

03:22.533 --> 03:25.367
when you ignite a world conflict
while seated on the toilet.

03:25.470 --> 03:28.337
Look what happened when we took
the moon mission seriously.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.039
All we got was
a bunch of ugly rocks

03:30.107 --> 03:32.374
while the moon's
strutting around the galaxy

03:32.477 --> 03:33.777
with our sweet-ass flag.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.744
Forget Trudeau.
Nobody important cares about him.

03:36.847 --> 03:38.580
Holy shit!
Trudeau is coming?

03:38.682 --> 03:40.115
Let me guess ...
He's one of your

03:40.116 --> 03:42.216
pillhead-turned-venture-
capitalist friends.

03:42.318 --> 03:44.486
You're thinking of Derek,
Bingo, and Derek P.

03:44.588 --> 03:46.554
Trudeau's, like,
the coolest world leader.

03:46.656 --> 03:49.492
- He's basically my long-lost brother.
- Earth to Don Jr. ...

03:49.493 --> 03:51.959
your real brother is right here.

03:52.060 --> 03:54.895
And if this Trudeau guy is
so much cooler than me,

03:54.997 --> 03:57.464
why hasn't he scored
free shoes for life

03:57.566 --> 04:00.266
after getting backed over
by a Payless truck?

04:00.369 --> 04:02.803
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
'cause he's not a dipshit.

04:02.905 --> 04:05.739
Boys, boys.
Keep going.

Are you all right?

04:24.759 --> 04:27.109
I haven't heard screams like that since

04:27.110 --> 04:29.460
Jeff Sessions saw photos
of Harriet Tubman on money.

04:29.563 --> 04:31.163
You think I'd be in better shape

04:31.231 --> 04:33.131
after all those years
on the golf course,

04:33.233 --> 04:35.233
carting around,
slamming into groundskeepers.

04:35.335 --> 04:38.537
Is this because Justin Trudeau
is visiting,

04:38.639 --> 04:42.740
and he has cute dimples,
and his skin isn't the color

04:42.842 --> 04:46.410
of an abandoned rusted wagon
wheel forgotten by history?

04:46.412 --> 04:47.946
He's not that great.

04:47.947 --> 04:50.548
Last election, I had
to beat "Crooked Hillary."

04:50.650 --> 04:51.349
Who did he beat?

04:51.350 --> 04:54.052
Probably some uptight,
honey-glazed salmon.

04:54.053 --> 04:57.888
Donald, why must you
turn someone as innocent

04:57.889 --> 05:01.724
and graceful as Justin
Trudeau into an opponent?

05:01.760 --> 05:05.895
At the risk of making a suggestion,
you could become friends.

<i>When you need a friend,

<i>buy a cigar and name it.</i>

05:14.039 --> 05:16.039
<i>Isn't that right, David?</i>

05:16.140 --> 05:18.674
So, my father taught me
there's no difference

05:18.776 --> 05:20.043
between friends and enemies.

05:20.044 --> 05:22.678
I still turned out
incredibly emotionally secure.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.846
I mean, I'm no David, but who is?

05:24.949 --> 05:26.782
<i>[stately music]</i>

05:26.884 --> 05:29.384
Why do you wanna be friends
with this Trudeau loser?

05:29.486 --> 05:31.820
His hair curls.
It's unnatural.

05:31.922 --> 05:34.555
Real hair looks like
a handful of damp linguine.

05:34.657 --> 05:36.791
He's the son of
a world leader, like me,

05:36.893 --> 05:39.426
so he knows what it's like
to live with strict rules,

05:39.528 --> 05:41.562
like don't do
the jerking-off hand motion,

05:41.664 --> 05:44.765
don't leave your Oakleys on
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.601
These are our struggles, Eric.

05:46.703 --> 05:48.535
But we have a good thing going, Don.

05:48.638 --> 05:52.371
We're like a stool
perfectly balanced on two legs.

05:52.474 --> 05:54.641
A third leg could
throw off everything.

05:54.743 --> 05:55.776
Ehh! Wrong!

05:55.777 --> 05:56.777
When Trudeau joins us,

05:56.778 --> 06:00.097
our stool's gonna be so
awesome that every woman

06:00.098 --> 06:03.216
will want to bang it, and every
dude will want to fight it.

06:03.318 --> 06:06.452
Guys, I don't think I can
make the state dinner.

06:06.554 --> 06:08.988
I... can't find a sitter for Eric.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.823
Sir, I know this Trudeau fella

06:10.925 --> 06:12.825
has taken the wind
out of your skin flaps,

06:12.927 --> 06:15.127
but this is no time
for self-doubt.

06:15.229 --> 06:17.830
I hesitate to weaponize
the deep insecurities

06:17.932 --> 06:21.100
that prevent you from enjoying
even a moment of REM sleep,

06:21.201 --> 06:22.801
but your father, Fred Trump ...

06:22.903 --> 06:24.769
He would have
taken down Trudeau.

06:24.871 --> 06:26.138
Oh. Oh, no!

06:26.139 --> 06:29.507
Memories from my childhood
are boiling up again!

06:29.609 --> 06:30.676
Here they come!

06:30.677 --> 06:32.810
Oh! Ohh! Oh, God.

06:32.912 --> 06:35.847
All right, now let's bury
him deep so they only appear

06:35.848 --> 06:38.783
as angry spasms
that disrupt international order!

06:38.885 --> 06:42.285
And... they're down!

06:42.387 --> 06:44.087
Whoo! Okay.

06:44.189 --> 06:46.356
I don't want to see
those any time soon.

06:46.458 --> 06:49.425
So let's drop a sandbag
in front of that tidal wave

06:49.528 --> 06:55.632

Justin Trudeau!

07:11.609 --> 07:13.743
a toast, followed by entertainment.

07:13.845 --> 07:15.445

07:15.479 --> 07:16.929
we are not fielding requests

07:16.930 --> 07:19.815
for the entertainment portion
of the evening.

07:19.816 --> 07:21.883
I've gone ahead and booked
my favorite band ...

07:21.985 --> 07:23.685
H.R. And The McMasters.

07:23.787 --> 07:26.354
Ah, we're an alt-rock,
hip-hop, experimental

07:26.456 --> 07:28.456
kind of "singer-songwritery"
thing.

07:28.559 --> 07:30.092
If you guys like rock,

07:30.093 --> 07:31.893
Karen just bought me
a wind chime.

07:31.995 --> 07:35.029
On the side,
I am DJ Shitdirge.

07:35.130 --> 07:38.398
I spin at Fjord Fest, an
underground, all-Nordic Coachella...

07:38.500 --> 07:42.036
Okay, enough with
the self-promotion, people.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.504
That's not what we do

07:43.505 --> 07:46.506
at the Donald J. Trump
Organization's White House.

07:46.609 --> 07:47.909
Thank you, Mr. President.

07:47.910 --> 07:50.543
Now that we've decided
that H.R. And The McMasters

07:50.645 --> 07:53.680
will be the entertainment,
let's discuss the intelligence dossier

07:53.782 --> 07:55.548
on Justin Pierre James Trudeau.

07:55.650 --> 07:57.750
Strengths ... collaborates
with world leaders,

07:57.852 --> 08:00.152
reads his briefings,
and runs a sub-two-hour mile.

08:00.254 --> 08:02.221
Jesus, is this guy the Terminator?

08:02.323 --> 08:04.857
Weaknesses ... Distracts
people with his good looks

08:04.960 --> 08:07.459
so that they fail to see
the kind, intelligent soul

08:07.561 --> 08:09.294
he longs
to share with the world.

08:09.396 --> 08:11.730
Also, baseball bats to his trachea!

08:11.832 --> 08:14.600
Gentlemen, my training starts today.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.703
And don't take it easy on me
just because I stabilize my mood

08:17.805 --> 08:20.005
with a daily dose of 30 Diet Cokes.

08:20.107 --> 08:23.308
Look, apparently this state
dinner needs guests of honor.

08:23.410 --> 08:24.643
That's where
you two come in.

08:24.644 --> 08:26.777
Oh, we would love to be
your guests of honor.

08:26.879 --> 08:28.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
First things first ...

08:28.748 --> 08:31.917
What animals are we riding in on,
and when do we get to eat them?

08:31.918 --> 08:33.518
We're not honoring you two.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.586
They don't give out awards
for overbites

08:35.688 --> 08:38.288
or getting into Ubers
with open containers.

08:38.390 --> 08:40.491
We need Canadian celebrities,

08:40.592 --> 08:42.258
and it's gonna be tough to find them.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.894
They don't have our talent pool ...

08:43.895 --> 08:46.763
great Americans like
Drake and Jim Carrey.

08:46.865 --> 08:48.765
So just book someone
shaped like a big leaf

08:48.867 --> 08:51.111
or a guy with frostbite.

08:51.169 --> 08:53.970
Sir, our dossier indicates
that Prime Minister Trudeau

08:54.072 --> 08:55.705
will likely,
to assert his dominance,

08:55.807 --> 08:57.673
violently shake your hand.

08:57.775 --> 08:59.474
So, we've recruited
a member of Congress

08:59.576 --> 09:02.077
with an extremely strong grip.

09:02.179 --> 09:03.979
Ted Cruz!
That's right.

09:04.081 --> 09:06.314
Texas is all about
the firm handshake.

09:06.416 --> 09:10.052
But to learn it, ya first
gotta master the mental game.

09:10.154 --> 09:12.220
Give your partner a nice smile.

09:12.322 --> 09:13.922
Next, tell him that only thing

09:13.924 --> 09:15.690
preventing him
from losing his arm

09:15.792 --> 09:18.126
is the demented mind of a madman.

09:18.227 --> 09:21.362
Last, thrash around like
you have a marble inside ya

09:21.464 --> 09:25.399
- and only five seconds to dig it out.
- Let's just skip to the practice.

09:25.501 --> 09:27.802
We haven't even discussed
electrifying your hand

09:27.904 --> 09:31.506
by shoving a frayed extension cord
right up your keister.

09:31.507 --> 09:32.874
[Donald] Ugh! Damn it!

09:32.875 --> 09:34.808
None of these snowflake
Canadian celebrities

09:34.910 --> 09:36.010
want to party with us.

09:36.011 --> 09:38.444
You ban a billion Muslims
and, all the sudden,

09:38.547 --> 09:40.580
people think you don't
know how to throw down.

09:40.683 --> 09:42.515
It's time to do
what we always do ...

09:42.617 --> 09:44.617
go to Mom's house
until Dad feels isolated

09:44.720 --> 09:46.253
and bribes us to come home.

09:46.254 --> 09:48.605
Wait, Eric.
We're gonna do something

09:48.606 --> 09:49.822
we've never done before.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.491
Roll down the window before
vomiting in the "Uber?"

09:52.593 --> 09:56.862
No, we're gonna keep trying
after encountering a slight setback.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.665
Okay, Daddy, with state dinners,

09:59.767 --> 10:01.600
subtlety is the name
of the game. [Music]

10:01.703 --> 10:04.203
I'm thinking maple tones,
muted red accents,

10:04.305 --> 10:05.471
springtime in Saskatchewan.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.939
Subtlety might have worked
for the Trump Taj Mahal

10:08.041 --> 10:09.641
or those "Lock her up" chants,

10:09.642 --> 10:12.011
but I think I wanna be a little
"in your face" this time.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.312
I want something that screams "America."

10:14.414 --> 10:17.148
Oh. So more reds,
whites, and blues?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.051
More beef.
I want an all-cow affair.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.953
I'm talking luxurious
slabs of Angus,

10:23.055 --> 10:24.422
goblets of milk,

10:24.423 --> 10:28.092
leather-bound menus full
of slaughterhouse photos.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.095
You know, beef lollipops,
build-your-own-beef-sundae bar,

10:31.197 --> 10:32.863
sirloin volcano.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.798
We're gonna show
those Saskatcha-wieners

10:34.900 --> 10:37.901
how real Americans
guzzle cow juice.

10:38.003 --> 10:41.071
- Sir, that sounds like a nightmare.
- Fine. Also, balloons.

10:41.072 --> 10:43.873
<i>[Eric] Aww, Jared, you look,
actually, very pretty.</i>

10:43.975 --> 10:45.742
So, you can't get Canadian celebrities,

10:45.844 --> 10:47.777
and now I have to dress up
as all of them?

10:47.879 --> 10:49.645
You know what? I don't even
know why I'm complaining.

10:49.748 --> 10:51.513
I mean, at this point,
I'm the human equivalent

10:51.616 --> 10:53.983
of an abandoned sedan
full of yellow newspapers.

10:54.085 --> 10:56.352
Uh, cool. So during the
welcome, you'll need to be

10:56.454 --> 10:58.153
in hair and girdle
as William Shatner,

10:58.255 --> 11:00.655
and then for cocktail hour,
you're Justin Bieber.

11:00.758 --> 11:03.458
At the toast, Shania Twain,
and by the end of the night,

11:03.560 --> 11:05.094
you're Ellen Page or Céline Dion.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.695
It's your choice.
We're not picky.

11:06.797 --> 11:12.234
<i>We are, uh, just moments away
from Justin Trudeau's arrival.</i>

11:37.926 --> 11:41.828
It's terrific.
This is my guy. I love him.

know each other yet.

11:50.938 --> 11:53.105
Hello.
I'm Canada's Justin Trudeau.

11:53.207 --> 11:55.473
I'm the Prime Minister.
That's like your President.

11:55.575 --> 11:57.943
I'm excited to talk about
Canada's ten provinces.

11:58.045 --> 12:00.078
That's like your states.

Don!
You didn't listen.

12:15.494 --> 12:17.094
I specifically told you

12:17.163 --> 12:20.798
to ship an electrical wire
down to Louisi-anus!

12:21.300 --> 12:24.400
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be here.

12:24.502 --> 12:27.938
And I look forward to continuing
our great nation's tradition

Congratulations, Donald.

13:25.594 --> 13:28.896
As for me, I'd like to announce
that I'm donating my salary

to a new charity that
installs breast pumps

Really? Now that
I see him up close,

I kinda think he's
the definition of cool.

Wake up, Eric.
He's a poser.

- What's your deal, dude?
- Oh. I understand.

14:47.271 --> 14:49.371
You may have noticed that
I'm extremely charming

14:49.473 --> 14:50.806
and fun to converse with.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.675

President Obama out of office,

- This is important!
- Just because you're the front man

doesn't mean you can boss me
around. I still outrank you.

15:34.081 --> 15:36.482
We agreed that when
we pick up these instruments,

15:36.583 --> 15:38.118
we're all the same rank.

If we're all the same rank,

to name the band!
