01:10.949 --> 01:13.416
Funny thing. You have mud
covering both of your ...

01:18.356 --> 01:19.556
Ohh!

01:42.547 --> 01:45.548
Green tea with honey,
and a redeye, three extra shots.

01:45.584 --> 01:47.083
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:47.119 --> 01:49.652
You're drinking
four shots of espresso.

01:49.688 --> 01:52.455
Yeah, 'cause these stupid cups
don't hold five.

01:52.491 --> 01:56.126
So I can take that to mean
that you're not sleeping?

01:56.161 --> 02:00.029
Almost every time I close
my eyes, I see her face.

02:00.065 --> 02:03.099
I know. So do I.

02:03.135 --> 02:05.335
I just can't believe
Alice got out of jail.

02:05.370 --> 02:09.104
I mean, we were so close.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.209
- How does that make you feel?
- Bad.

02:13.245 --> 02:15.678
And mad.

02:15.714 --> 02:19.415
- And sad.
- Strong feelings.

02:19.451 --> 02:22.452
- You care to explore them?
- They're pretty simple.

02:22.487 --> 02:24.554
Well, but what's behind them is not.

02:24.589 --> 02:27.524
And you have been through so much.

02:27.559 --> 02:29.526
I mean, look inside.
What do you see?

02:29.561 --> 02:34.631
I'm even madder and...
sadder.

02:34.666 --> 02:37.567
- Nothing else?
- No, I ...

02:37.602 --> 02:39.702
I don't know why this woman
is obsessed with me.

02:39.738 --> 02:43.039
I talked to her once
at the police academy.

02:43.074 --> 02:45.575
I don't know what I've done
or what she thinks I've done.

02:45.610 --> 02:48.044
I just ... I don't where she is,

02:48.079 --> 02:53.316
and until I have answers, I just ...
This is it.

02:53.351 --> 02:57.086
- Bad, sad, mad.
- Exactly.

02:59.357 --> 03:01.157
Thanks for understanding.

03:02.214 --> 03:03.580
Okay, I'm gonna go.

03:03.615 --> 03:06.483
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna go find her.

03:08.253 --> 03:11.154
- It was nice having coffee with you.
- Yeah, good talk.

03:31.269 --> 03:33.769
<b>6x18 - "A Shot in the Dark"</b>

03:38.764 --> 03:41.097
Four years for possession
with intent to distribute.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.066
So Alice Sands is a drug dealer.

03:43.101 --> 03:45.235
That explains
where she got all the cash

03:45.304 --> 03:47.204
to be able to screw with my life.

03:47.239 --> 03:49.206
- I called Paul o'Connell.
- From the drug unit.

03:49.241 --> 03:51.474
Yeah, he's the guy that arrested
Alice and put her in prison.

03:51.510 --> 03:54.477
- He's expecting you.
- Okay. Great.

03:54.513 --> 03:56.446
Well, the guard who supervised
Alice Sand's release

03:56.481 --> 03:58.448
saw her get into a gold
Plymouth Satellite,

03:58.483 --> 04:01.651
- but he didn't get a plate.
- They stopped making those in 1975.

04:01.687 --> 04:04.754
Great. I'll put out a BOLO
for the make, model, and color.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.356
He get a look at the driver
who picked her up?

04:06.391 --> 04:08.792
No. But we're pulling video
that might have caught an image.

04:08.827 --> 04:10.060
Now that Alice Sands is out,

04:10.095 --> 04:13.363
- I want to arrange protection, Jane.
- No.

04:13.398 --> 04:14.831
No, the last time you did that,

04:14.867 --> 04:16.099
I ended up in an
apartment all by myself.

04:16.134 --> 04:18.368
- Jane.
- What ... you're getting married today.

04:18.403 --> 04:19.369
Can't miss that.

04:19.404 --> 04:22.873
- Can I?
- Wha... I ...

04:22.908 --> 04:24.774
That's what I thought.

04:28.881 --> 04:31.047
We only caught her
because we got lucky.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.850
<i>She was pulled over
on a routine traffic stop,</i>

04:33.886 --> 04:36.286
and there was a bag in the trunk
with enough cocaine in it

04:36.321 --> 04:38.221
to bring her up
on intent to distribute.

04:38.257 --> 04:42.125
But before that, she's never
been on our radar in any way.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.027
Okay, well, what about the rest
of her operation?

04:44.062 --> 04:47.764
Well, she didn't give up
any information on it.

04:47.799 --> 04:50.200
I mean, we dug around ...
looked into possible associates.

04:50.235 --> 04:53.436
- We came up with nothing.
- So you couldn't shut it down?

04:53.472 --> 04:58.008
No. If her organization exists,
it's deep, deep underground.

04:58.043 --> 05:01.344
Well, there's got to be something.
I mean, a paper trail

05:01.380 --> 05:03.713
or something
from another investigation...

05:03.749 --> 05:07.250
I'm sorry, detective.
I got to go. I'm on a stakeout.

05:07.286 --> 05:10.696
Good luck finding a drug ring
that the drug unit couldn't.

05:16.929 --> 05:19.829
It's hard to believe
that's Alice Sands' dad.

05:19.865 --> 05:22.999
- Yep. Supercop.
- Damn straight.

05:23.035 --> 05:25.335
Someone should make a movie about him.

05:25.370 --> 05:28.305
No one would believe it.
This guy was amazing.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.240
And his brother.
His dad, too.

05:30.275 --> 05:35.178
The fantastic three.
Why did Alice break the mold?

05:35.213 --> 05:38.048
Because Marvel had the rights
to "Fantastic Four?"

05:38.083 --> 05:41.551
Nerd humor. Nice.

05:41.586 --> 05:45.322
Hey. So I left four messages
for Detective McFadden,

05:45.357 --> 05:48.258
and I finally got one back ...
"leave me alone."

05:48.293 --> 05:50.293
- I'll go.
- You know him?

05:50.329 --> 05:52.562
No, but I know his language.
You have an address?

05:52.597 --> 05:57.133
- I'll text it to you.
- Okay.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.374
Hey. What'd you find out
from o'Connell?

06:04.409 --> 06:07.043
That Alice knew how to keep her
drug business completely buried.

06:07.079 --> 06:09.045
- We already knew that.
- Yeah.

06:09.081 --> 06:11.047
Did you get a list of her
visitors while she was in jail?

06:11.083 --> 06:12.916
It's bizarre.
She didn't have any.

06:12.951 --> 06:15.986
What?
She was there for four years.

06:16.021 --> 06:17.354
Not one visitor.

06:17.389 --> 06:20.423
This woman leaves no trace
of anything behind her.

06:20.459 --> 06:22.388
Jane, we got a hit
on the gold Plymouth.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.555
It was involved in a murder
in Maine this morning.

06:26.098 --> 06:28.331
<i>The car belongs
to a woman named Wendy Allen</i>

06:28.367 --> 06:29.966
who was at MCI Framingham.

06:30.002 --> 06:33.136
- The same time as Alice?
- Cellmates.

06:33.171 --> 06:34.504
Wendy was in for prostitution
and minor drug charges.

06:34.539 --> 06:37.340
Served 11 months.
Released two weeks ago.

06:37.376 --> 06:39.876
Here she is in Maine.

06:39.911 --> 06:41.511
Both the shooter and Wendy
are still at large.

06:41.546 --> 06:43.446
That's Wendy
coming out of the store

06:43.482 --> 06:45.048
after the trooper is shot.

06:45.083 --> 06:48.084
- Do we have footage of the driver?
- No.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.053
So we can't be sure
that's Alice Sands.

06:50.088 --> 06:53.890
She shot a cop and left her
cellmate behind. That's her.

06:53.925 --> 06:55.191
Tell the locals we're on our way.
Come on, Frankie.

06:55.227 --> 06:57.927
It's her turn to be chased.

07:09.718 --> 07:14.354
Request permission to expand
the search area.

07:14.389 --> 07:16.656
Stay with quadrants A and B.
She's got the river on one side.

07:16.692 --> 07:19.359
- We covered the road on the other.
- Copy that.

07:19.394 --> 07:22.863
Gun's still holstered, so he
didn't feel like he was in danger.

07:22.898 --> 07:26.066
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
Died instantly.

07:26.101 --> 07:28.668
This wasn't a murder.
It was an execution.

07:29.671 --> 07:31.605
I'm sorry. This must
be very difficult for you.

07:33.108 --> 07:35.041
We got a good print
off the broken wine bottle.

07:35.077 --> 07:36.576
Belongs to Wendy Allen.

07:36.612 --> 07:38.445
Uh, we can have our officer in our BRIC

07:38.480 --> 07:41.648
- send you everything we have.
- No, we're good.

07:41.683 --> 07:43.483
- Are you sure, because ...
- Get Ramirez on it.

07:45.584 --> 07:47.284
Trooper, do you have a problem
with us being here?

07:47.319 --> 07:49.152
I never have problems
on my crime scenes.

07:49.188 --> 07:51.521
There's mud underneath his nails.

07:51.557 --> 07:54.291
Well, yeah,
the security video caught him

07:54.326 --> 07:55.792
wiping it off the license plate.

07:55.828 --> 07:57.394
He couldn't read the numbers.

07:57.429 --> 07:58.795
Yeah, because she covered them up.

07:58.831 --> 08:00.664
Well, I'd like to get
a sample of this mud.

08:00.699 --> 08:02.199
If we know its origin,

08:02.234 --> 08:03.500
we know where Alice Sands was
prior to coming here.

08:03.535 --> 08:04.768
Our M.E.'s on the way from Lewiston.

08:04.803 --> 08:06.503
I'd like him to secure the evidence.

08:06.538 --> 08:08.272
Who I'm sure is excellent,
but Dr. Isles is the best.

08:08.307 --> 08:09.573
We'll handle it.

08:09.608 --> 08:11.375
Frederickson, make sure
the scene stays fresh.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.278
Okay, did your office tell you
our connection to this case?

08:14.313 --> 08:17.214
I believe the woman that you're
looking for is Alice Sands.

08:17.249 --> 08:18.615
She's an ex-con

08:18.651 --> 08:21.485
who's been targeting me
and my family for weeks.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.886
And Trooper Juster
is like family to me,

08:22.921 --> 08:24.388
so it's personal for all of us.

08:24.423 --> 08:26.423
Great!
Then let's work together and ...

08:26.458 --> 08:29.359
Officer.
Not long ago, I was abducted.

08:29.395 --> 08:31.428
Chloroformed.
My hands were bound.

08:31.463 --> 08:34.798
- He hit me.
- Oh, that's awful.

08:34.832 --> 08:37.234
All that was done at the behest
of the woman we're chasing,

08:37.269 --> 08:38.735
who most likely killed your friend.

08:38.770 --> 08:40.871
<i> J.D., it's Williams.</i>

08:40.905 --> 08:42.371
Go.

08:42.408 --> 08:44.574
<i>Dogs picked up a scent.
Quadrant B, West.</i>

08:44.610 --> 08:46.209
<i>We think it's Wendy Allen.</i>

08:46.245 --> 08:50.347
- On my way. Let's go.
- Thanks.

08:50.382 --> 08:53.950
- Frankie.
- Jane.

08:53.986 --> 08:55.952
I'm gonna take the samples
back to Boston for analysis.

08:55.988 --> 08:56.953
Okay.
I'll see you there.

08:56.989 --> 09:01.825
- We need to take her alive.
- No guarantees.

09:08.334 --> 09:09.433
<i>Who the hell is it?</i>

09:10.769 --> 09:13.704
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

09:13.739 --> 09:16.606
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
I'm through with cops.</i>

09:16.642 --> 09:20.210
McFadden, it's Vince Korsak.
I brought a friend.

09:20.245 --> 09:21.278
<i>I got scotch.</i>

09:21.313 --> 09:22.879
Come on. One drink.

09:22.915 --> 09:24.848
I won't be long.
I'm on the way to a wedding.

09:24.883 --> 09:27.884
<i>Really?
Who's getting married?</i>

09:27.920 --> 09:29.619
I am.

09:29.655 --> 09:30.620
<i>Well, good luck.</i>

09:30.656 --> 09:32.456
Fourth time's the charm, huh?

09:32.491 --> 09:35.471
<i>Fourth?</i>

09:45.571 --> 09:47.904
Dewey. It's J.D.
Any visual on the suspect?

09:47.940 --> 09:49.506
<i>No, sir.</i>

09:49.541 --> 09:50.807
Widen the search area.

09:50.843 --> 09:53.543
<i>Copy that.
Proceeding to quadrants C and D.</i>

10:00.319 --> 10:02.519
Watch the hunting blinds.

10:36.054 --> 10:38.121
Mayor's citation for bravery.

10:38.157 --> 10:41.558
Medal of valor.
Police officer of the year?

10:41.593 --> 10:45.028
Yeah, yeah.
Lots of ribbons and plaques.

10:45.063 --> 10:48.765
Nothing for "father of the year".

10:48.801 --> 10:50.934
I mean, that's what you want
to know about, isn't it?

10:50.969 --> 10:53.069
Alice comes from a family
of decorated cops.

10:53.105 --> 10:57.474
- Mm.
- She took a different path. It's curious.

10:57.509 --> 11:01.144
It's a lot more than curious.
This is tragic.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.413
That's my daughter, detective.

11:03.449 --> 11:06.349
And even so, she'd be
the one I'd be looking for

11:06.385 --> 11:07.918
if I was still on the force.

11:07.953 --> 11:09.953
Nobody's pointing
a finger at you.

11:09.988 --> 11:12.789
Well, maybe they should.

11:14.593 --> 11:21.364
Look, I think about this all the time.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.800
My Alice was perfect in high school.

11:23.836 --> 11:27.037
She was valedictorian, cap...

11:30.442 --> 11:33.143
captain of the softball team.

11:33.178 --> 11:36.680
And there's every reason to believe

11:36.715 --> 11:40.183
that she would have graduated
first in her class at the academy.

11:40.219 --> 11:42.619
But then, all of a sudden,
everything went sideways.

11:42.654 --> 11:44.554
Something happen?

11:44.590 --> 11:49.192
She didn't do as well
as I'd hoped, as she had hoped.

11:49.228 --> 11:53.063
She resigned.
I mean, she quit.

11:53.098 --> 11:55.432
She said she didn't have
the heart for it anymore,

11:55.467 --> 11:57.000
and the only reason
why she was there

11:57.035 --> 11:59.870
was because she was, uh ...

11:59.905 --> 12:03.773
- she was a McFadden.
- What'd Alice do after that?

12:03.809 --> 12:07.911
It wasn't cop business,
so I just didn't care.

12:07.946 --> 12:10.747
It's, uh ...
after she got arrested...

12:10.782 --> 12:13.617
I sure learned a lot, didn't I?

12:13.652 --> 12:17.954
- Did you visit her in prison?
- Hell, no.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.624
I haven't talked to Alice

12:20.659 --> 12:24.094
since she, uh,
got her inmate number.

12:24.129 --> 12:27.831
And nobody in my family has, either.

12:27.866 --> 12:29.666
Look, that's it.
That's everything, all right?

12:29.701 --> 12:31.735
That's high school,
that's the academy.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.703
You mind if I take that
down to the station?

12:33.739 --> 12:36.139
- Please do.
- I'll make sure you get everything back.

12:36.174 --> 12:39.692
No need, detective.
No need.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.217
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

12:47.252 --> 12:49.753
I mean, this is just all about them.

12:49.788 --> 12:53.623
- I think it's beautiful.
- It still makes me ...

12:53.659 --> 12:56.126
- Nervous?
- Yes.

12:57.896 --> 13:00.864
Why? Do you think I'm going
to propose to you?

13:00.899 --> 13:02.098
What?

13:06.872 --> 13:09.940
- Don't worry. You're safe.
- Mm.

13:09.975 --> 13:13.677
- Feel better?
- Oh, yeah.

13:13.712 --> 13:17.213
- I won't wear it.
- It's a tiny nod to propriety.

13:17.249 --> 13:18.782
Do it for me.

13:18.817 --> 13:20.784
Oh, I'm sorry, Mimi,
but this is for me and Vince.

13:20.819 --> 13:22.752
We're having
exactly the wedding we want.

13:22.788 --> 13:24.254
<i>Speaking of Vince, Kiki.</i>

13:24.289 --> 13:25.989
I have some real
time restraints today.

13:26.024 --> 13:27.791
Yeah, yes.
I'll try him again.

13:27.826 --> 13:29.626
<i>No.</i>

13:29.661 --> 13:34.497
- Hello, future Mrs. Korsak.
- Oh. I am so glad you're here.

13:35.634 --> 13:37.601
- Oh, wow.
- Oh.

13:37.636 --> 13:40.837
- Wow. You look ...
- Oh, thank you.

13:40.872 --> 13:41.771
And wow.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.173
- You know.
- Oh.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.809
Hey, where were you?
Ron was worried.

13:45.844 --> 13:50.680
- Nothing to do with you.
- So it does have to do with me?

13:50.716 --> 13:53.817
I think I'm gonna get
something from the bar.

13:53.852 --> 13:56.686
- It's not open.
- Sure, it is.

13:56.722 --> 14:00.090
- Ooh, I can help myself.
- Oh.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.825
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.893
Great.
Let's do this.

14:03.929 --> 14:05.762
Maura called.
Jane's gonna be a little late.

14:05.797 --> 14:07.797
- Oh.
- Uh, where's Maura?

14:07.833 --> 14:09.199
She's across at the lab
running some tests.

14:09.234 --> 14:10.667
She'll come over
when I give the word.

14:10.702 --> 14:12.068
- Okay.
- Vince.

14:12.104 --> 14:15.038
- We're gonna lose Judge Carter.
- Everything will be all right.

14:15.073 --> 14:16.139
I'm gonna call Jane
and get an exact time.

14:16.174 --> 14:19.275
Okay.

14:29.287 --> 14:31.755
She's not picking up.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.923
Probably driving. I bet
she's right around the corner.

14:44.036 --> 14:47.801
You're taller than I expected.

14:54.816 --> 14:56.549
Drop the gun.

15:05.926 --> 15:09.528
You know what Alice did to me.

15:09.563 --> 15:10.862
Can you imagine
what she's gonna do to you

15:10.898 --> 15:12.264
when she doesn't
need you anymore?

15:12.299 --> 15:16.168
- Keep talking while you can.
- She left you at the station.

15:16.203 --> 15:18.303
She left you out here
to fend for yourself.

15:18.338 --> 15:19.504
She's got a plan.

15:19.540 --> 15:24.810
- She tell you that plan?
- Shut up.

15:24.845 --> 15:27.353
You better start thinking
about yourself, Wendy.

15:28.015 --> 15:30.815
Because Alice only thinks
about herself.

15:31.618 --> 15:33.185
She loves me.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.996
- Like she loved Joe Harris?
- She had sex with him.

15:36.031 --> 15:37.772
For a man, that's as good as love.

15:37.808 --> 15:39.107
- So she was just using him?
- That's right.

15:39.142 --> 15:43.178
- But she's not using you?
- Shut... up.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.048
You know what?
Fine.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.751
Let's say Alice does love you.

15:49.786 --> 15:51.720
She killed a state trooper.

15:51.755 --> 15:54.589
These woods are full of angry troopers.

15:54.624 --> 15:57.113
You getting shot.
Was that part of the plan?

15:59.029 --> 16:00.625
I love her.

16:01.998 --> 16:04.933
Okay.
But you're not a killer.

16:05.968 --> 16:08.002
You're not.

16:10.707 --> 16:12.750
Give me the gun.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.618
<i>Korsak, I'm so sorry.</i>

16:23.653 --> 16:25.220
Well, you had a gun to your head.

16:25.255 --> 16:27.222
<i>It's not like you stopped
to catch a movie.</i>

16:27.257 --> 16:29.057
Yeah, I know, but I just ...
I still feel bad.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.759
<i>You have that right.</i>

16:30.794 --> 16:34.162
Um, just ... I'll be there
as soon as I can, okay?

16:34.197 --> 16:37.031
<i>Eh, what's a few hours between
friends with an open bar?</i>

16:37.067 --> 16:40.101
I'm making margaritas!

16:42.205 --> 16:44.706
It's Nina.
Just apologize to Kiki for me?

16:44.741 --> 16:47.175
- Will do.
- Okay.

16:47.210 --> 16:48.877
Nina.

16:48.912 --> 16:51.613
Wendy's family owns a cabin
an hour from the gas station.

16:51.648 --> 16:54.916
I'm sure that's where
they were headed.

16:54.951 --> 16:56.697
<i>It's about 45 minutes
from the Canadian border.</i>

16:56.732 --> 16:59.687
- I'm sending you the coordinates.
- Okay, thanks.

16:59.723 --> 17:01.689
Where's Miller?

17:01.725 --> 17:04.192
- What do you got?
- GPS coordinates

17:04.227 --> 17:05.894
for a cabin owned by Wendy's family.

17:05.929 --> 17:09.097
- You think Alice is there?
- Yeah, I think that was her plan.

17:15.539 --> 17:17.771
What surprises me the most

17:17.808 --> 17:20.074
is the moisture retention in this soil.

17:20.109 --> 17:23.778
The PH is decidedly different
than the crime scene samples.

17:23.814 --> 17:26.114
Mm-hmm.

17:26.148 --> 17:29.150
- Are you reading a comic book?
- Uh, yeah.

17:29.186 --> 17:30.819
I found them in the high school box.

17:30.854 --> 17:32.821
These "Archies" are by far
the most interesting.

17:32.856 --> 17:36.758
- Really? How so?
- Well, in every way.

17:36.793 --> 17:38.960
I mean, this guy's got
a hell of a lot going on.

17:38.995 --> 17:42.330
- Kent.
- Of course.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.233
I do have a breakdown on the
organic carbon content of the soil

17:45.268 --> 17:48.036
as well as particle size
distribution and bulk density.

17:48.071 --> 17:49.804
Great.
I'd like to see it.

17:51.274 --> 17:54.809
You know, I think Principal
Weatherbee's far too hard on Archie,

17:54.845 --> 17:56.711
and I don't believe
for one second he's ex-military.

17:56.746 --> 17:59.714
If I say I agree with you,
can we move on?

17:59.749 --> 18:01.950
Of course.

18:04.921 --> 18:07.188
- A little space, Kent.
- Oh.

18:12.362 --> 18:16.898
There's no way the mud
on those plates is from Maine.

18:16.933 --> 18:19.234
No, it's from the banks
of the Charles River.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.069
Hmm.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.883
When did you tell Alice
about the family cabin?

18:36.386 --> 18:38.786
Was it a few months
after you met her?

18:38.822 --> 18:40.622
Hmm?

18:40.657 --> 18:43.157
Mm. I'll bet that you told her

18:43.193 --> 18:47.695
and then quickly, your
relationship got physical, huh?

18:47.731 --> 18:49.998
You wanted Alice,
she wanted the cabin.

18:50.033 --> 18:53.167
She used you
just like she used Joe Harris.

18:53.203 --> 18:54.736
State troopers are at the cabin.

18:54.771 --> 18:56.371
Nobody's there,
but it's fully stocked

18:56.406 --> 18:58.740
as if two people were
gonna be there for a while.

18:58.775 --> 19:01.309
- Car.
- No tracks.

19:01.344 --> 19:07.048
Mm. So no car, no Alice.

19:07.083 --> 19:11.386
- I love her.
- She's not capable of love.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.955
- She is.
- No, she isn't!

19:13.990 --> 19:17.025
- She only cares about herself.
- That's not true.

19:17.060 --> 19:20.295
- Wendy, you got to help yourself.
- She loved me.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.963
- It doesn't matter now.
- It matters.

19:21.998 --> 19:23.164
- No.
- I matter.

19:23.199 --> 19:24.732
- Not to her, you didn't!
- I mattered!

19:24.768 --> 19:27.135
Me and her son ... we mattered.
And nobody else!

19:27.570 --> 19:29.137
She has a son?

19:30.407 --> 19:33.741
What's his name?
Wendy, what is his ...

19:33.777 --> 19:35.310
- Frankie.
- What's up?

19:35.345 --> 19:37.378
Alice has a son.
Call Nina.

19:37.414 --> 19:39.681
Tell her to look somewhere
near the Charles River.

19:48.158 --> 19:50.792
- I'm sorry, Vince.
- The law must be served.

19:50.827 --> 19:52.060
You're a good man.

19:52.095 --> 19:54.729
Well, we can debate that later.
Thanks, man.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.066
Jane.

19:58.101 --> 19:59.334
<i>I'm an hour away.</i>

19:59.369 --> 20:00.802
<i>Just start the ceremony without me.</i>

20:00.837 --> 20:03.037
Don't bother. We had to
send Judge Carter on his way.

20:03.073 --> 20:04.105
<i>Oh, Vince...</i>

20:04.140 --> 20:06.841
No, it's all right.
My best man's worth waiting for.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.744
And don't rush.
We've rescheduled for tomorrow.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.245
Where's Alice?

20:11.281 --> 20:14.882
<i>Stay with Kiki, okay?
We'll discuss the case tomorrow.</i>

20:19.489 --> 20:21.022
Sorry.

20:23.126 --> 20:25.126
I'm still here.

20:36.940 --> 20:39.240
- How's Kiki?
- Fine.

20:39.275 --> 20:40.441
- Really?
- Absolutely.

20:40.477 --> 20:42.910
- I'm more concerned about you.
- Don't be.

20:42.946 --> 20:44.412
Nina called.
She's got something.

20:44.447 --> 20:47.081
Alice is on the run.
She's gonna make a mistake,

20:47.117 --> 20:48.082
and I'm gonna get her, Vince.
I can feel it.

20:48.118 --> 20:49.083
Come on.

20:49.119 --> 20:52.387
- Hey.
- I've been staring at maps

20:52.422 --> 20:54.355
<i>and thinking about
where Alice would be going.</i>

20:54.391 --> 20:55.823
The border?
Well, she can't get across.

20:55.859 --> 20:57.558
And we have a BOLO on the Plymouth.

20:57.594 --> 21:00.094
- And an APB for Alice.
- And she knows that.

21:02.298 --> 21:03.431
- She dyed her hair.
- Yeah.

21:03.466 --> 21:05.166
Now she looks like Wendy Allen.

21:05.201 --> 21:08.202
Because nobody's looking
for Wendy Allen.

21:08.238 --> 21:10.805
Alice, as Wendy,
walked into Canada

21:10.840 --> 21:12.774
at the Estcourt Station
crossing two hours ago.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.449
Okay, she's not dodging us again.

21:21.484 --> 21:23.484
We'll have the RCMP bring her in.
The mounties will get her.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.221
Yeah, I want her here.
Now.

21:40.816 --> 21:43.750
- Is this everything, Kent?
- Uh, yeah.

21:43.786 --> 21:45.385
More "Archie"?

21:45.421 --> 21:48.288
I promise, everything of evidentiary
value is on that wall there.

21:48.324 --> 21:51.258
I do not understand
your fascination with these.

21:51.293 --> 21:52.926
It ... they're all just dating

21:52.962 --> 21:57.431
and flirting
and crushes and makeouts.

21:57.466 --> 21:59.366
Look.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.702
I went to an all-boys boarding
school on a barren heath.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.471
The only girl I ever saw
was on a poster for cheese.

22:04.506 --> 22:06.840
These ... they're a great primer
for relationships,

22:06.875 --> 22:10.010
- something I know nothing about.
- But it's just comic books.

22:10.045 --> 22:13.447
<i>- Oh. Here comes Jane.
- Thank God.</i>

22:13.482 --> 22:15.582
Well, I guess we'll continue
our conversation later, Betty.

22:15.618 --> 22:17.651
And I'll see you later, too, Veronica.

22:17.686 --> 22:20.387
- Later, jughead.
- All right, so you ...

22:20.422 --> 22:23.523
Please tell me
you've got something good.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.660
I've created a psychological
profile of Alice Sands.

22:26.695 --> 22:29.730
I thought if you could better
understand the way she thought ...

22:29.765 --> 22:30.998
I could figure out
what she was gonna do next.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.332
Fantastic.

22:32.368 --> 22:34.968
Alice Sands, the high school student,
was popular.

22:35.004 --> 22:37.938
- Homecoming queen.
- Smart.

22:37.973 --> 22:40.507
Valedictorian.

22:40.542 --> 22:44.711
- National honor society. Wow.
- And driven.

22:44.747 --> 22:46.813
"I want to be the first
woman president

22:46.849 --> 22:49.883
or the president of the corporation
that makes that happen."

22:49.918 --> 22:51.585
All right.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.688
She came from a family of highly
decorated police officers,

22:54.723 --> 22:56.456
which creates a conflict.

22:56.492 --> 22:57.991
When she joined
the police academy,

22:58.027 --> 23:00.861
she assumed that she would
excel, but she didn't.

23:00.896 --> 23:02.562
She struggled
because you were there.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.831
Wh ... Me?
I didn't even know her.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.066
Well, she knew you,

23:06.101 --> 23:07.768
and she recorded
your time in the mile,

23:07.803 --> 23:11.705
your test scores, all of which
were faster and higher than hers.

23:11.740 --> 23:14.441
You can graduate number two
and still be a good cop.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.527
Well, for Alice Sands,
anything less than number

23:16.528 --> 23:18.578
one was a failure to
herself and to her family.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.981
Some rough life.

23:21.016 --> 23:24.584
Based on this profile,
Alice's fixation with you,

23:24.620 --> 23:26.787
the seeds of which were planted
in the police academy,

23:26.822 --> 23:28.488
bloomed when she was in prison.

23:28.524 --> 23:31.725
Cut off from her family, she lost
all connection to who she was.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.527
And she had a lot of time to think.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.028
A narcissistic high achiever

23:35.064 --> 23:37.497
needs somebody to blame
when things go wrong.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.499
And Alice Sands believes
that you're the reason

23:39.535 --> 23:42.669
that her life didn't go as planned.

23:42.705 --> 23:45.372
I just don't think she's gonna
stop coming after you, Jane.

23:45.407 --> 23:50.644
- I think you're right.
- I'm sorry.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.846
No, don't be.
This is great.

23:55.617 --> 23:57.050
Jane.

23:57.086 --> 23:59.686
Wait. Jane.

23:59.722 --> 24:03.557
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

24:03.592 --> 24:05.892
What does the target
of an obsessive narcissist do

24:05.928 --> 24:08.895
- to draw their attention?
- This is a bad road.

24:08.931 --> 24:11.064
Well, I didn't pick this road.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.433
I'm sure as hell
not gonna let her drive.

24:18.807 --> 24:20.640
Wedding. Yes.
Going to get ready.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.943
Don't.
I just sent Kiki home.

24:22.978 --> 24:26.513
- Why? Did you call it off?
- Postponed.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.716
Frankie and Nina found
Alice Sand's son.

24:32.421 --> 24:33.720
Eric Stone visited Wendy

24:33.756 --> 24:35.122
every single week
she was incarcerated.

24:35.157 --> 24:37.090
And when Wendy was released,
he visited Joanne Scott,

24:37.126 --> 24:39.993
- the cellmate who replaced her.
- In Alice Sands' cell.

24:40.028 --> 24:42.662
Because he wasn't visiting Wendy.
He was visiting Alice.

24:42.698 --> 24:43.497
Do you know where we can find him?

24:43.532 --> 24:46.015
I do.

25:00.015 --> 25:02.849
"BCU ... a renowned institute
of higher learning

25:02.885 --> 25:05.152
located by the beautiful Charles River.

25:05.187 --> 25:08.522
Where you can get a great
education in an historic setting."

25:08.557 --> 25:10.056
And mud for your license plate.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.092
<i>All right, look.
We'll divide and conquer.</i>

25:12.127 --> 25:15.629
Tonight.
7:00 at the Libes?

25:15.664 --> 25:21.935
- Excuse me. Eric Stone?
- Alice Sands' son?

25:24.072 --> 25:26.907
- That's a yes.
- Hey!

25:26.942 --> 25:30.677
Hey!
Take it easy.

25:35.484 --> 25:39.519
Eric Stone.

25:39.555 --> 25:42.389
<i>Anthropology major.</i>

25:42.424 --> 25:45.692
Dean's list.
Service award.

25:47.896 --> 25:52.499
- Doesn't add up.
- Why? Because of my mother?

25:52.534 --> 25:53.934
Alice Sands isn't actually your mother.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.302
Biologically? No.

25:55.337 --> 25:58.438
Legally, no.
You were never adopted.

25:58.474 --> 26:02.743
And yet on your college
registration forms,

26:02.778 --> 26:07.648
it says, "emergency contact:
Alice Sands, mother."

26:07.683 --> 26:11.251
We don't have papers,
but she's my mother.

26:11.286 --> 26:12.819
She saved my life,
took care of me,

26:12.855 --> 26:16.323
set me on the right path.
She loves me.

26:16.358 --> 26:18.625
We're listening.

26:20.896 --> 26:25.332
I never knew my dad.
I was 5 when my mom OD'd.

26:25.367 --> 26:27.300
I bounced around between relatives.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.570
When I was 14, my cousin Freddie
had me on the street

26:30.606 --> 26:32.773
as a lookout while he sold drugs.

26:32.808 --> 26:36.810
Alice lived in the neighborhood.
She took me in.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.578
And were you a part
of her drug business?

26:38.614 --> 26:42.315
- She's a legitimate businesswoman.
- They why'd you run?

26:42.351 --> 26:44.351
You framed her, you can frame me.

26:46.422 --> 26:47.788
- She wasn't framed.
- Look.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.890
Alice put me on the right track,

26:49.925 --> 26:52.092
made me stay in school,
paid my tuition.

26:52.127 --> 26:55.495
- Okay, and then she turned to crime.
- No, she was framed.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.030
- By who?
- Cops.

26:57.066 --> 26:58.598
What cops?

26:58.634 --> 26:59.733
I don't know,
but that's what she told me.

26:59.768 --> 27:03.770
She was in jail because of cops.

27:03.806 --> 27:08.542
She's a great woman, my mother.
The best.

27:10.345 --> 27:13.747
Hey. Got some news.

27:22.835 --> 27:25.469
Alice Sands was spotted getting
off a bus in Québec City.

27:25.504 --> 27:27.571
They've tracked her
to a warehouse district.

27:27.606 --> 27:29.372
They've cordoned off
a two-block radius.

27:29.408 --> 27:31.641
As soon as backup arrives,
they'll move in.

27:31.677 --> 27:32.909
- Got to love the mounties.
- Yeah.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.378
- Let us know as soon as they have her.
- Will do.

27:35.414 --> 27:38.515
- Thanks, Frankie.
- Yeah.

27:38.550 --> 27:39.850
That's good.

27:39.885 --> 27:41.618
I'll make sure
the extradition goes quickly.

27:41.653 --> 27:45.789
- Great.
- I don't get Alice Sands at all.

27:45.824 --> 27:47.924
Bad person that did
something good with this kid.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.960
Do you think she has
legitimate businesses?

27:49.995 --> 27:51.495
Looking to change?

27:51.530 --> 27:52.662
Turn back into the Alice
she was supposed to be?

27:52.698 --> 27:54.464
Or these legitimate businesses

27:54.500 --> 27:55.932
were just a cover
for her drug operation.

27:55.968 --> 27:58.068
I think she killed a cop.
That's my bet.

27:58.103 --> 27:59.803
To say the least.

28:01.874 --> 28:03.741
Hey, Kiki.

28:04.777 --> 28:06.977
Okay.

28:07.012 --> 28:11.481
Well, let's talk.
All right.

28:11.517 --> 28:14.918
- Everything all right?
- I'm not sure.

28:14.953 --> 28:17.621
Guess when you postpone
your wedding twice,

28:17.656 --> 28:19.055
a person could have some questions.

28:19.091 --> 28:20.423
Well, go. Talk to her.

28:20.459 --> 28:21.792
- Are you going back in?
- No.

28:21.827 --> 28:23.527
I'm gonna let him sit for a while,

28:23.562 --> 28:25.729
have Nina check out
these legitimate businesses,

28:25.764 --> 28:29.052
start to dismantle her organization.

28:45.734 --> 28:47.300
That's not what I said.

28:47.336 --> 28:50.437
I would never tell you
to draw a sociopath to you.

28:50.472 --> 28:51.838
Well, that's what I heard.

28:51.874 --> 28:53.840
Well, you heard
what you wanted to hear.

28:53.876 --> 28:56.710
- Doesn't everybody?
- Not like you.

28:56.745 --> 28:58.311
- That's not true.
- Okay.

28:58.347 --> 28:59.646
I just want you to stay in one piece.

28:59.681 --> 29:02.203
Okay, well, that we can agree on.

29:03.318 --> 29:06.553
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi!

29:06.588 --> 29:11.958
- Can you, um, describe me?
- What?

29:11.994 --> 29:13.493
Just, you know, like what kind
of person you think I am.

29:13.529 --> 29:18.432
- Uh, what's going on?
- Jane is trying to figure out

29:18.467 --> 29:21.034
why this Alice Sands
is so obsessed with her.

29:21.069 --> 29:24.538
Oh. Okay.

29:24.573 --> 29:27.774
Someone with your confidence and drive

29:27.810 --> 29:30.410
can seem like a complete mystery

29:30.446 --> 29:32.579
to a person who lacks
one or the other.

29:32.614 --> 29:37.517
So therefore, they feel intimidated.

29:37.553 --> 29:40.987
That's the non-clinical version,
and she's right.

29:41.023 --> 29:44.991
- I don't mean to be intimidating.
- But you are.

29:45.027 --> 29:46.927
Yeah, you don't mean to be
a pain in the ass, either,

29:46.962 --> 29:49.896
- but sometimes I ...
- Yes, I wonder where I got that.

29:49.932 --> 29:52.065
It's a mystery.

29:54.770 --> 29:57.437
Oh, there's something going on
with Korsak and Kiki.

29:58.607 --> 29:59.639
<i>This looks serious.</i>

29:59.675 --> 30:01.641
Oh. He looks angry.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.643
No, no, no.
That's just his face.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.111
We have an announcement.

30:05.147 --> 30:07.914
It's kind of a big one,
if we could get your attention.

30:07.950 --> 30:12.052
What?
It's... beautiful.

30:12.087 --> 30:15.822
- Ron, do you think you could help out?
- Okay.

30:15.858 --> 30:17.157
- Who's that?
- Okay. Here we go.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.592
The sister.

30:18.627 --> 30:21.428
We both realized
that given what I do,

30:21.463 --> 30:23.563
there will always be
another emergency.

30:23.599 --> 30:25.065
Yes.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.967
And we've tried to keep this
wedding as simple as possible,

30:27.002 --> 30:28.168
which hasn't worked.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.537
Wha... You're not canceling
the wedding.

30:30.572 --> 30:32.973
- We're getting married in 20 minutes.
- Judge Carter's on the way.

30:33.008 --> 30:34.975
Yeah!

30:35.010 --> 30:37.844
Yes, and I'll make coffee for Mimi.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.080
I'll throw some water on her.

30:40.115 --> 30:42.916
- And I have to change.
- Yes. Oh! So do I!

30:42.951 --> 30:44.117
- Okay. Bye, Ma.
- Bye.

30:44.152 --> 30:46.119
Do you have a dress in a drawer?

30:46.154 --> 30:49.489
- Maybe. Where's yours?
- Evidence locker.

30:54.530 --> 30:57.264
- Hey.
- Any word from the mounties?

30:57.299 --> 31:00.801
They're getting ready to move in.

31:01.803 --> 31:03.970
Which I just told my sister
two minutes ago.

31:04.006 --> 31:05.505
I'll tell her again.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.674
I tracked Eric Stone's BCU tuition check

31:07.709 --> 31:09.776
to an "S" corp
controlled by Alice Sands.

31:09.811 --> 31:11.711
That led me down this trail.

31:13.482 --> 31:16.607
"Quincy Street Investments.
West End Appliances.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.986
New Brunswick Woodworks."
These are legitimate?

31:20.022 --> 31:22.722
Seems like it,
but their origin,

31:22.758 --> 31:24.991
tax information
that details what they do,

31:25.027 --> 31:27.193
it's all buried under layers
of shell corporations

31:27.229 --> 31:28.662
and registering agents.

31:28.697 --> 31:30.163
Why would you do that
if they're clean?

31:30.198 --> 31:31.765
Because you're using them
for things that aren't.

31:34.296 --> 31:36.903
Wedding's on!

31:36.939 --> 31:39.906
Yes, it is.
I'm getting my hat.

31:39.942 --> 31:42.709
Okay. Wait.
You have a special wedding hat?

31:42.744 --> 31:44.811
It's just a little hat.

31:44.846 --> 31:48.848
It's only right for weddings.

31:48.884 --> 31:51.017
<i>You know, those Canadian
businesses might make it easier</i>

31:51.053 --> 31:53.314
<i>to move things across the border.</i>

31:56.858 --> 31:57.824
Nice.

31:57.859 --> 32:01.595
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.063
Ah.

32:04.933 --> 32:07.767
- Aren't you coming?
- Oh, yeah.

32:07.803 --> 32:10.604
I just got to call Nicole.
She's coming.

32:10.639 --> 32:14.841
- Great.
- It is great, right?

32:14.876 --> 32:17.043
That's what I said.
Why wouldn't it be?

32:17.079 --> 32:19.846
Oh, I don't know.
I just thought you should know.

32:19.881 --> 32:23.883
- Now I know.
- Great.

32:23.919 --> 32:26.720
- See you there.
- Yeah.

32:50.078 --> 32:53.580
- Kiki ...
- Wait! Sorry.

32:53.615 --> 32:56.950
Can we all just make sure
that our cellphones are off?

32:56.985 --> 32:58.585
<i>Thank you, Jane.</i>

33:00.789 --> 33:03.189
Kiki.

33:08.730 --> 33:11.698
When I'm not with you,

33:11.733 --> 33:13.600
I will be waiting for you.

33:13.635 --> 33:16.269

39:13.775 --> 39:17.009
Well, with the amount of alcohol
that I'm gonna consume,

39:17.045 --> 39:18.845
that ... it's just not
gonna work for me.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.480
Okay.

39:20.515 --> 39:22.381
Well, it would be a great color
on your skin tone,

39:22.417 --> 39:23.516
so think about it.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.386
Yeah, I've thought about it.
No.

39:27.422 --> 39:28.788
That's... I'm gonna need straps.

39:30.525 --> 39:34.627
So the best man
needs to make a toast.

39:34.662 --> 39:37.530
- Jane?
- Oh, God. That's me.

39:37.565 --> 39:38.631
- Okay.
- Yes.

39:38.666 --> 39:40.566
<i>- Toast. Yeah.
- Toast! Come on!</i>

39:40.602 --> 39:42.368
<i>- Toast!
- Toast!</i>

39:42.403 --> 39:44.470
<i>- Speech!
- Speech!</i>

39:44.506 --> 39:47.406
<i>- Speech!
- Come on!</i>

39:47.442 --> 39:52.044
I'm no expert on love.
Or marriage.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.646
Or toasts, actually,
now that I think about it.

39:53.681 --> 39:55.782
<i>Um...</i>

39:55.817 --> 39:58.050
but I have a PhD in Vince Korsak.

40:00.021 --> 40:03.589
So I know
what a good man looks like.

40:05.026 --> 40:07.527
And when you look at Kiki,

40:07.562 --> 40:10.530
<i>and Kiki, when you look at him,
and you smile, it just ...</i>

40:10.565 --> 40:13.099
that's what true love is.

40:13.134 --> 40:15.468
That's what true love looks like.

40:18.540 --> 40:23.743
So, uh, to Vince and Kiki.
May you always look like that.

40:23.778 --> 40:25.011
<i>- Yeah! Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

40:25.046 --> 40:27.580
<i>- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.</i>

40:30.485 --> 40:31.818
Ow!

40:31.853 --> 40:34.587
My God, I thought
the plumbing exploded again.

40:51.005 --> 40:53.472
Rice for you.

40:53.508 --> 40:54.707
- Rice for ...
- No!

40:54.742 --> 40:56.075
We're supposed
to throw this at Korsak?

40:56.110 --> 40:58.845
- It's traditional.
- I think it's gonna piss him off.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.012
- Nah, what do you think, Maura?
- Is he armed?

41:02.083 --> 41:03.783
Back home, it's tradition
to capture the groom,

41:03.818 --> 41:05.852
strip him to the waist,
and blacken him with treacle

41:05.887 --> 41:07.720
- and then parade him around the village.
- All right.

41:07.755 --> 41:10.756
I'm crossing "see a Scottish
wedding" off my bucket list.

41:10.792 --> 41:12.625
- Unless it's Kent's.
- Thank you very much.

41:14.162 --> 41:16.662
<i>Oh! Hey!</i>

41:20.001 --> 41:21.534
Listen.
If you need me, I'm reachable.

41:21.569 --> 41:23.769
- Oh, stop.
- A littles less reachable.

41:23.805 --> 41:25.972
- Thank you.
- All right, tomorrow.

41:26.007 --> 41:27.173
- Could you not?
- It's the fourth one.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.709
<i>I mean, like, come on.
Seriously.</i>

41:29.744 --> 41:30.977
Gun!

41:38.594 --> 41:42.972
