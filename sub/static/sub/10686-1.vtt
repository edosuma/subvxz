00:32.098 --> 00:34.033
>> Gwen: I hear normal kids

00:34.035 --> 00:35.567
normally spend their normal

00:35.569 --> 00:37.836
summer vacations at the beach or

00:37.838 --> 00:39.204
the mall -- oho!

00:39.206 --> 00:40.072
That's right.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.507
We were supposed to go to the

00:41.509 --> 00:42.608
mall today.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.742
>> Max: Sorry, honey.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.811
Got a little sidetracked.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.554
>> This nuclear reactor is the

00:55.556 --> 00:58.957
perfect way to detonate my DNA

00:58.959 --> 01:01.960
bomb into the atmosphere and

01:01.962 --> 01:04.629
de-evolutionize the world!

01:06.801 --> 01:15.307
>> Gwen: Took him long enough.
>> Heatblast: Okay, animo, science class is canceled.

01:15.309 --> 01:19.711
>> Fool! In less than a minute,
the world will get a lesson it will never

01:19.713 --> 01:27.820
forget! In the meantime,
meet my latest creation.

01:27.822 --> 01:31.957
>> Heatblast: Bring it on!
I'll barbecue that bug.

01:36.329 --> 01:43.135
Oh, yeah.
Being a hero rocks!

01:57.851 --> 02:06.492
>> Gwen: Hey!
Hothead, DNA bomb ticking down over here, remember?

02:06.494 --> 02:11.029
Aah!
Oh!

02:19.372 --> 02:25.711
>> Even you can't generate enough heat to melt that casing!
>> Heatblast: If I can't shut it

02:25.713 --> 02:33.952
down, I'll just have to turn it up.
>> Gwen: Ben, you don't know

02:33.954 --> 02:37.656
what that's going to do. >> Heatblast:
Can't be any worse than what's going to happen if I

02:37.658 --> 02:46.899
don't. >> No!
You're overloading the system!

02:46.901 --> 02:49.101
>> Heatblast: That's the idea.

03:10.089 --> 03:14.626
>> Max:

03:20.099 --> 03:28.941
>> You may have ruined my plan today, Tennyson,
but there's always tomorrow!

03:28.943 --> 03:34.446
>> Max: Ben, are you okay? >> Ben: Yeah.
Good thing I was heatblast, 'cause that DNA wave

03:34.448 --> 03:38.016
would have scrambled me.
>> Gwen: What's up with the

03:38.018 --> 03:41.753
watch?
>> Ben: I don't know.

03:56.302 --> 04:00.372
All right!
I got the green early.

04:00.374 --> 04:04.276
>> Max: Hold off, now, Ben. Who knows what's going on?
>> Ben: But animo is getting

04:04.278 --> 04:06.545
away.
I can't catch him if I don't go hero.

04:06.547 --> 04:16.555
Stinkfly cleared for takeoff. >> Wildmutt:
>> Grey matter: Sometimes I

04:16.557 --> 04:22.261
think this thing just plain hates me.
>> Gwen: How are you planning on

04:22.263 --> 04:25.530
catching up to animo now,
short stuff?

04:28.968 --> 04:36.074
>> Someday, my pet, that snot-nosed hero will get his!
>> Grey matter: In the meantime,

04:36.076 --> 04:38.043
here's yours.

04:52.191 --> 05:00.198
Time... To cut this little pygmy punk down to size!
>> Grey matter: Whoa!

05:00.200 --> 05:05.737
Whoa-oh!
>> Aah!

05:09.175 --> 05:15.047
>> Grey matter: Ohh, that's
gonna leave a mark.

05:15.049 --> 05:23.789
>> Ben: Aah! Huh?

05:23.791 --> 05:27.125
>> Max:
You're really getting good at some of those spells in that book.

05:27.127 --> 05:32.331
>> Gwen: Practice makes perfect.
>> Ben: That was awesome. What's next?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.634
>> Gwen:
Now we get to do something I want to do for a change.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.903
>> Ben: What? Aw, man!

05:44.010 --> 05:47.879
Take that! Hyah!
And that! Hyah! And that!

05:56.356 --> 06:03.862
You're going down.
Sumo slammers death blow! Aah!

06:03.864 --> 06:08.800
>> This is a store, not a boxing
ring.

06:13.406 --> 06:17.676
>> Gwen: How do you think these will make me look?
>> Ben: Like a total -- mnh!

06:17.678 --> 06:20.912
>> Max: You'd look lovely in all of them.
>> Gwen: But I don't know which

06:20.914 --> 06:28.520
one to pick. >> Max: So get them all.
>> Gwen: Thanks, grandpa.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.790
Pbht!
>> Ben: Bleh!

06:31.792 --> 06:35.627
>> Max: Let's not ruin Gwen's day, huh?
>> Ben: What about ruining <i>my</i>

06:35.629 --> 06:39.431
day?
I'm the one stuck in some dumb clothing store during <i>my</i> summer

06:39.433 --> 06:43.568
vacation. >> Max: Now, Ben,
Gwen needs a break from the whole "battling

06:43.570 --> 06:47.973
bad guys and aliens" thing -- that's all.
She just wants to feel normal

06:47.975 --> 06:51.476
again. >> Ben:
Trust me -- there's nothing normal about Gwen.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.646
Huh?
>> Gwen: This is so fun!

06:54.648 --> 06:58.316
Hey, can we go shoe shopping
after this?

06:58.318 --> 07:07.826
>> Ben: Yaaah!

07:07.828 --> 07:14.633
>> Gwen: Ben! >> Ben:
It wasn't my fault -- the watch just wigged out.

07:14.635 --> 07:21.306
And not my size.
>> Gwen: Banned from an entire

07:21.308 --> 07:25.343
mall?!
I've never been so humiliated in all my life!

07:25.345 --> 07:29.448
>> Ben: That's not true.
You've been humiliated plenty of times worse than that.

07:29.450 --> 07:34.920
>> Gwen: Yeah, and all by you! >> Ben:
That's all I'm saying. >> Max: Okay, you two.

07:34.922 --> 07:38.990
We'll all feel better after a good night's sleep.
>> Gwen: Only if I wake up with

07:38.992 --> 07:42.294
a new cousin.
>> Ben: Pbht!

07:46.532 --> 07:53.371
Oh, morning already?
Oh, somebody turn off the sun.

07:53.373 --> 07:59.211
>> Max: Oh, it's 3:30.
The sun doesn't come up for another two hours.

08:15.461 --> 08:21.366
>> Ben: I don't know who that
is, but he's gonna think twice

08:21.368 --> 08:26.404
before he changes my wake-up call.
Going hero.

08:26.406 --> 08:34.980
Whoa! A diamondhead crystal?
Tetrax!

08:34.982 --> 08:40.719
>> Good to see you again, Ben.
>> Ben: Yeah. It's good to see you, too.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.989
>> Gwen:
We haven't seen you since we took down sixsix together.

08:43.991 --> 08:49.594
How have you been? >> I've been a little busy,
but i came as soon as I heard.

08:49.596 --> 08:54.666
>> Ben: Yeah, about munching that x-321 you
gave me -- see, i was going after animo, and I

08:54.668 --> 08:58.203
zigged instead of zagged, and, well...
>> I'm not here about that

08:58.205 --> 09:02.007
board, Ben. >> Ben: Really?
Then why are you here?

09:02.009 --> 09:06.344
>> I picked up the sdm signal from the omnitrix.
>> Ben: This? It's just the

09:06.346 --> 09:12.617
watch acting wacko again -- no biggie.
>> Max: Sdm? Self-destruct mode?

09:12.619 --> 09:16.121
>> The omnitrix broadcasts a signal when it begins its countdown.

09:16.123 --> 09:20.125
>> Ben: The watch is gonna destroy itself?
>> Along with whoever is wearing

09:20.127 --> 09:23.395
it at the time.
>> Ben: Oh, man.

09:26.766 --> 09:32.771
>> So,
you have no idea what triggered the omnitrix self-destruct mode?

09:32.773 --> 09:36.408
>> Gwen: Ben, you don't know
what that's going to do.

09:40.746 --> 09:46.451
>> Ben: It's a mystery.
>> Gwen: Really?

09:46.453 --> 09:52.390
Think hard, Ben.
You don't remember <i>anything</i> that may have caused this to happen?

09:52.392 --> 09:56.962
>> Ben: Well, it doesn't really matter,
does it, Gwen, since tetrax is here to take care of

09:56.964 --> 10:00.231
it.
>> I haven't a clue how to deactivate the omnitrix.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.902
Only azmuth would know how to do that.
>> Ben: Who's azmuth?

10:03.904 --> 10:08.740
>> The rumored creator of the omnitrix.
Details on him are sketchy at

10:08.742 --> 10:12.077
best.
No one is even quite sure which planet he lives on.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.981
>> Gwen: So, how are you going to find him?
>> On my ship, I have the

10:15.983 --> 10:20.118
equipment we need to examine the omnitrix for azmuth's DNA signature.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.990
It's like an autograph on his work.
Once we have that, we can scan

10:24.992 --> 10:30.629
the galaxy until we locate him. >> Max:
How long until the watch self-destructs?

10:30.631 --> 10:35.700
>> Judging from the pattern's repetition,
I'd say less than four earth days.

10:35.702 --> 10:40.005
We'd better get going.
There's no telling who else has picked up on the signal.

10:40.007 --> 10:46.945
>> Max: Road trip, space style!
>> Sorry, Max. We can't run the risk of some

10:46.947 --> 10:51.449
alien somewhere recognizing you. >> Max:
I understand. I guess you're gonna get that

10:51.451 --> 10:55.954
break from your cousin after all.
>> Ben: Translation -- no dweebs

10:55.956 --> 11:00.392
allowed in space. >> Max: Ben,
I'm concerned you're not taking this

11:00.394 --> 11:04.629
seriously. >> Ben: I know, I know.
It's always serious, grandpa,

11:04.631 --> 11:08.833
and I always win. >> Gwen:
With some help, thank you very much.

11:08.835 --> 11:14.472
>> Ben: I'll be okay, okay? We'll find the creator,
he'll fix the watch, and I'll be back

11:14.474 --> 11:19.811
before you know it. >> Gwen:
Try not to mess things up, okay?

11:19.813 --> 11:23.915
>> Ben: Since when do I ever mess things up?
>> Gwen: Do you want your list

11:23.917 --> 11:27.719
in chronological or alphabetical order?
>> Max: Take good care of my

11:27.721 --> 11:29.721
grandson.

11:34.660 --> 11:39.364
>> Ben: Cool.
>> Yes, it is... Cool, isn't it?

11:58.718 --> 12:04.255
>> Ben: Whoa, what's this? >> This is my training room.
Have to stay in shape between

12:04.257 --> 12:09.094
missions. That's the hover simulator.
It can re-create over 1,000

12:09.096 --> 12:12.897
different courses.
You're welcome to use it any time.

12:12.899 --> 12:18.303
>> Ben: Yeah! Yes!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

12:18.305 --> 12:22.407
Whoa. Awesome!
Check it out!

12:22.409 --> 12:28.079
Looks like a big video game.
Aah!

12:28.081 --> 12:33.251
Living snot! >> That's my pilot, gluto.
>> Ben: Hey.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.388
>> Ben: Yeah, nice to meet you,
too.

12:37.390 --> 12:43.928
>> I assume you're familiar with space-travel protocol?
>> Ben: Oh, sure.

13:10.823 --> 13:20.932
>> Ben: So this is what a pancake feels like!
A-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

13:20.934 --> 13:29.140
Ah, hey!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

13:29.142 --> 13:34.045
>> Initiating artificial gravity.
>> Ben:

13:34.047 --> 13:38.316
Ugh!
Space travel looks so much easier in the movies.

13:38.318 --> 13:43.822
>> I don't mean to interrupt your naptime,
but we really should examine the watch.

13:50.062 --> 13:57.335
>> Your ship will be useful in my quest for the omnitrix,
and when I recover it, I will exact

13:57.337 --> 14:04.576
my revenge on the earth-boy who imprisoned
me in that cursed null void dimension.

14:09.415 --> 14:13.518
>> Master, we have intercepted a signal.
It appears to be from the

14:13.520 --> 14:22.327
omnitrix. >> The omnitrix in space?
What is Tennyson up to?

14:22.329 --> 14:26.497
>> Ready? >> Ben:
Would "no" be an option? >> Don't worry.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.535
I've had many of these tests performed on myself.
Never felt a thing.

14:30.537 --> 14:36.107
>> Ben: But don't you have, like,
diamond-hard skin? >> Ah.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.443
Good point. Let's get started.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.921
Can't find azmuth's DNA signature anywhere.
Do you have any ideas where it

15:22.923 --> 15:26.758
could be? >> Ben:
When my dad got my mom a watch for their anniversary, he

15:26.760 --> 15:31.829
had them engrave some writing on the back of it.
>> Of course.

15:41.006 --> 15:48.646
Found it.
Now we can scan for the being with that DNA composition.

15:48.648 --> 15:54.619
That can't be right. According to this,
azmuth is on incarcicon, the prison planet.

15:54.621 --> 15:59.290
>> Ben:
The creator of the omnitrix is in some space slammer?

15:59.292 --> 16:04.295
Why? >> Unknown,
but it's home to the scummiest of the scum of the

16:04.297 --> 16:09.600
universe.
Lay a course to incarcicon.

16:09.602 --> 16:16.607
>> Security breach, lower level.
We have an intruder.

16:16.609 --> 16:22.680
We have to assume the worst.
If we split up, we can cover more ground.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.516
>> Ben: Especially xlr8.

16:28.620 --> 16:32.490
>> Wildmutt: >> Good thinking.
The vulpin's keen senses should

16:32.492 --> 16:39.397
be able to sniff out the intruder.
>> Wildmutt

17:02.321 --> 17:10.194
>> Gwen: Hey! Paws off, fido!
Save the mad dog routine, will

17:10.195 --> 17:14.565
ya? It's not like I <i>want</i> to be here,
but I figured you could use some

17:14.567 --> 17:17.568
backup.
>> Wildmutt:

17:30.616 --> 17:45.730
>> Gwen: I can't hold on!
A-a-a-a-h!

17:45.732 --> 17:57.308
Ugh!

17:57.310 --> 18:03.314
>> Gwen: >> What happened?
>> Ben: Door must be defective.

18:03.316 --> 18:08.719
It just flew open. >> Gwen,
you're the intruder? >> Gwen: Sorry.

18:08.721 --> 18:14.092
I just figured since Ben can't find his toothbrush
when it's stuck in his mouth, he could use

18:14.094 --> 18:18.296
some help finding the creator.
>> Ben: Hey! >> Gwen: I'm just kidding.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.767
Ben never brushes his teeth. >> Ben:
Can we turn around and drop her back on earth?

18:22.769 --> 18:27.939
You know, like from orbit? >> Sorry, Ben,
no time. We need every moment the

18:27.941 --> 18:32.243
omnitrix --
The countdown appears to have

18:32.245 --> 18:35.980
accelerated.
I have to check something out.

18:46.258 --> 18:50.928
>> Gwen: Aren't you a little bit worried that
the self-destruct countdown has sped up?

18:50.930 --> 18:54.699
>> Ben: Nah. I work best under pressure.
>> Gwen: This doesn't only

18:54.701 --> 18:58.769
affect you, you know. What about grandpa?
I'm sure he doesn't want you to

18:58.771 --> 19:03.941
get vaporized... Or whatever.
>> Ben: Look, tetrax and I have it covered.

19:03.943 --> 19:08.012
We'll find azmuth, he'll fix the watch,
and I'll keep kicking alien butt.

19:08.014 --> 19:13.618
>> Gwen:
Tetrax said azmuth would deactivate the omnitrix, not fix it.

19:13.620 --> 19:22.026
>> Ben: A-a-a-h! Ugh!
You're just trying to mess with

19:22.028 --> 19:26.197
me. >> I'm afraid Gwen's right, Ben.
Truthfully, I thought you'd be

19:26.199 --> 19:30.835
relieved to have it off.
You've done well with the omnitrix, better than any

19:30.837 --> 19:34.872
earthling could have,
but now you can have a normal life again.

19:34.874 --> 19:39.143
>> Ben: Normal? Who wants to be normal?
If you're not a hero, you're a

19:39.145 --> 19:43.748
zero. >> Gwen: Thanks a lot.
>> Unfortunately, the computers

19:43.750 --> 19:48.519
confirm my fears.
Your transformations speed up the countdown.

19:48.521 --> 19:53.558
To be safe, you shouldn't use the omnitrix again.
>> Ben: Huh?

19:53.560 --> 20:03.034
Whoa-oa-oa!
Oh, man.

20:03.036 --> 20:10.208
>> Gwen: I see!
That's very cool.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.212
>> Ben: Great.
Gwen's in love with the snot blob.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.215
>> We're coming upon incarcicon.

20:26.391 --> 20:32.063
>> <i>You are approaching secure space of
the incarcicon intergalactic detention center.</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:36.434
<i>Identify yourself or be destroyed.</i>
>> Ben: What now?

21:01.660 --> 21:06.297
>> <i>Vendor security clearance accepted.</i>
<i>Proceed to sanitation disposal</i>

21:06.299 --> 21:10.668
<i>bay number four.</i>
>> Ben:

21:16.141 --> 21:21.412
>> Gwen: Sanitation disposal bay number four?
They think we're a garbage

21:21.414 --> 21:23.447
truck?

21:38.096 --> 21:42.633
>> I downloaded the DNA signature into my scanner.
It should lead us directly to

21:42.635 --> 21:47.772
azmuth, but if these prisoners see a human,
it'll be trouble. >> Gwen: Wow.

21:47.774 --> 21:53.210
The rest of the universe hates us that much?
>> No, most species love humans.

21:53.212 --> 21:59.450
They're considered quite a delicacy.
>> Ben: I could go alien, just

21:59.452 --> 22:03.788
this once.
>> And risk speeding up the self-destruct mode even more?

22:03.790 --> 22:07.625
No.
Every second's too critical until we find azmuth.

22:07.627 --> 22:12.129
You thinking what I'm thinking?
>> Exactly.

22:12.131 --> 22:18.936
From time to time, my missions require a disguise.
I have just the one for you two.

22:38.590 --> 22:44.428
>> Gwen: I'm an alien's butt.
It's official -- worst summer of my life.

22:44.430 --> 22:50.735
>> Ben: Hey, "rock, paper, scissors,"
two out of three -- i won fair and square.

22:50.737 --> 22:55.072
Where are the guards?
>> No guards, no rules, no parole.

22:55.074 --> 23:00.344
On incarcicon, it's survival of the meanest.
These aren't friendly types.

23:00.346 --> 23:09.053
They're all here for a reason --
some of them, lots of reasons.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.396
>> Mine! Mine!

23:24.369 --> 23:29.974
>> Ben: Uh, help yourself. I'm on a diet.
>> Gwen: What? What's happening?

23:29.976 --> 23:36.213
>> Ben: Trust me, you don't want to know.
>> Snacktime's over.

23:36.215 --> 23:40.317
Now move along.
Unless we have some other business.

23:40.319 --> 23:45.289
>> Maybe you guys should wait
over on the side until I can

23:45.291 --> 23:48.592
scope this place out.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.432
>> Ben: Hey, watch it!

24:01.807 --> 24:07.478
Huh? It can't be!
No way!

24:07.480 --> 24:11.982
He must have picked up on the self-destruct signal.
How did he know the creator was

24:11.984 --> 24:14.585
here? >> Gwen:
Who are you babbling about?

24:14.587 --> 24:19.356
>> Ben: If I have to give up going hero,
at least I'm gonna take down vilgax once and for

24:19.358 --> 24:24.595
all. >> Gwen: Vilgax?
Ben, wait!

24:24.597 --> 24:28.666
>> All: >> Gwen: Hi!
You guys have all had dinner,

24:28.668 --> 24:36.173
right? >> Upchuck:
I'm gonna chew you up and spit you out!

24:54.626 --> 24:58.362
>> It's not my fault you're
here, sixsix.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.932
Don't do the crime if you can't
do the time.

25:15.380 --> 25:21.819
>> What's your problem? >> Upchuck:
That voice. Hey, you're not vilgax.

25:21.821 --> 25:26.123
You're a girl!
>> Yeah, I know.

25:34.499 --> 25:38.602
>> He turned into a human -- but how?
>> The omnitrix!

25:38.604 --> 25:44.775
He's wearing the omnitrix! >> It <i>does</i> exist.
>> That's our ticket out of

25:44.777 --> 25:49.179
here! >> The omnitrix, he's got it!
>> Ben: I think we're in

25:49.181 --> 25:55.819
trouble. >> Gwen:
I really wish I was at the mall right now.

25:59.190 --> 26:07.364
>> Gwen: Way to keep a low
profile, genius.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.601
>> Ben: Looks like we're on our own.
>> Gwen: I was afraid you were

26:10.603 --> 26:16.807
going to say that.

26:47.806 --> 26:52.343
>> Careful -- with that thing on his wrist,
he can become any one of us he wants.

26:52.345 --> 26:57.147
>> Yeah, but if he knew how to control it,
he would have used it again by now.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.149
>> Give me that thing!

27:30.048 --> 27:39.056
>> You guys okay? >> Ben: Whoa!
>> That was my favorite board.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.766
>> Gwen: "Whoa" is right.

27:53.138 --> 27:57.408
>> How do they know about the omnitrix?
>> Ben: Funny story.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.410
I'll tell you later.

28:06.051 --> 28:09.086
Sorry about that whole "chew you up" thing.
I thought you were somebody

28:09.088 --> 28:13.557
else.
>> What are you doing with the omnitrix?

28:13.559 --> 28:17.895
>> Ben: What's it to you? >> Plenty,
after all the work i put into it, only to have it

28:17.897 --> 28:21.732
wind up on the wrist of some... Thing.
>> Ben: You created the

28:21.734 --> 28:25.602
omnitrix? You're azmuth?
Look, there's a major problem

28:25.604 --> 28:33.911
with the watch. >> Yeah,
I can see that. >> Gwen: Histus potiva!

28:39.250 --> 28:47.224
Hey! Less chitchat, more combat!
>> Ben: So, can you fix it?

28:47.226 --> 28:54.431
>> First you have to get me out of this galactic sewer.
>> Ben: Hey!

28:54.433 --> 29:01.605
Ah! Ugh! Let go of me!
Get your hands off!

29:01.607 --> 29:07.311
Oh, man, like I don't have
enough problems.

29:14.586 --> 29:22.893
>> Gwen: Ben! Ben, are you okay?
>> Ben: Uh, what?

29:22.895 --> 29:27.297
Mom, I don't want to go to school.
>> Gwen: Yeah, he's okay.

29:27.299 --> 29:32.102
>> But he won't be for long unless we can figure a way out of here.

29:44.649 --> 29:51.455
>> Gwen: Got to love that blob.
Hey! >> Ben: Tetrax, wait!

29:51.457 --> 29:55.993
The creator!
>> <i>You are not authorized to e in this maximum-security area.</i>

29:55.995 --> 30:00.364
<i>Exit or your ship will be</i>
<i>destroyed.</i>

30:05.103 --> 30:07.137
>> Gluto, get us out of here!

30:22.187 --> 30:26.890
>> Ben: Tetrax, no.
That's the creator!

30:31.329 --> 30:38.235
>> Nice to meet you.
>> You're not leaving without me!

30:41.840 --> 30:48.812
>> Ben, the hatch!
>> We're going to be blown to bits!

30:48.814 --> 30:51.715
>> Ben: Definitely not vilgax.

30:59.157 --> 31:04.394
Are we sure this is the way out
of here?

31:04.396 --> 31:06.430
>> Gluto is on it.

31:21.246 --> 31:26.250
>> Ben: Ah! Big wall coming up fast!
>> We're not gonna make it.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.785
>> Gwen: She may have a point.

31:37.028 --> 31:41.632
>> Ben: That was so cool!
Let's never do that again.

32:07.959 --> 32:11.728
>> What have you been using this for,
to open cans? Break rocks?

32:11.730 --> 32:15.499
>> Gwen: Sounds about right.
>> Ben: What about the self-destruct?

32:15.501 --> 32:20.137
I'm sure the genius who created the omnitrix
can stop the countdown without totally

32:20.139 --> 32:24.975
turning it off, right? >> Maybe,
but there is a problem.

32:24.977 --> 32:28.745
I didn't officially create the omnitrix.
>> All: What?!

32:28.747 --> 32:32.316
>> Ben:
You mean you're not the -- >> egocentric, selfish,

32:32.318 --> 32:36.286
self-promoting, "oh,
aren't I so brilliant" creator of the omnitrix?

32:36.288 --> 32:41.658
No, I'm myaxx, his assistant.
>> But it has your DNA signature on it.

32:41.660 --> 32:47.130
>> I, uh, may have accidentally erased azmuth's
DNA signature and put on my own, but that's

32:47.132 --> 32:51.335
only because he never gave me the credit I deserve.
>> Gwen: You might have

32:51.337 --> 32:55.005
mentioned this when we were risking our lives to bust you out of jail.

32:55.007 --> 32:59.676
>> If I had, I'd still be stuck in that slime pit,
wouldn't I? >> Ben: You can't stop the

32:59.678 --> 33:03.847
self-destruct countdown?
>> Azmuth never trusted me with the abort sequence.

33:03.849 --> 33:08.685
>> Give me one good reason why i shouldn't
shove you in an energy tube and shoot you back to

33:08.687 --> 33:12.556
incarcicon right now!
>> Because I know where azmuth is.

33:12.558 --> 33:16.226
>> Ben: That's a pretty good reason.
>> Where?

33:16.228 --> 33:21.865
>> Zenon. >> Zenon?
It had to be zenon.

33:21.867 --> 33:27.871
>> Gwen:
Why do I get the feeling that zenon isn't exactly a vacation paradise?

33:27.873 --> 33:32.409
>> The random energy blasts,
like the one on incarcicon -- they're growing larger and more

33:32.411 --> 33:36.680
intense, aren't they? >> Ben: Yeah.
>> They indicate the Omni energy

33:36.682 --> 33:40.083
inside is building to critical levels.
Eventually...

33:40.085 --> 33:44.821
>> Ben: I know. Poof. I'm toast.
>> Well, not just you, of

33:44.823 --> 33:47.491
course. >> Ben:
What are you talking about?

33:47.493 --> 33:54.097
>> Ask him. He knows,
don't you? You didn't tell him?

33:54.099 --> 33:58.735
>> If the self-destruct is allowed to detonate,
the explosion will cause an energy

33:58.737 --> 34:03.073
ripple that will literally rip apart the universe,
including earth.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.042
>> Both: Grandpa.

34:08.079 --> 34:11.848
>> Azmuth is a hopeless paranoid.
He built in the self-destruct as

34:11.850 --> 34:16.786
a last resort to keep his most prized creation out of the wrong hands,
but he never thought

34:16.789 --> 34:21.123
anyone would be foolish enough to set it off.
>> Gwen: Obviously he never met

34:21.126 --> 34:25.027
Ben. >> Ben:
I can't believe you knew about this the whole time and

34:25.030 --> 34:28.364
didn't tell me. >> I'm sorry, Ben.
I thought you'd be more

34:28.367 --> 34:32.902
concerned about how this affected you rather than others.
>> Ben: What do you mean?

34:32.905 --> 34:36.373
I help people all the time with the omnitrix.
>> That's true.

34:36.375 --> 34:41.545
You do help a lot of people,
but ask yourself this -- do you help because it's the right thing to

34:41.547 --> 34:45.248
do or for the thrill of being a
hero?

34:51.989 --> 35:02.966
>> Scan the area.
There. Retrieve that.

35:02.968 --> 35:06.670
...Myaxx.
>> But they must not have found

35:06.672 --> 35:11.441
what they were looking for on incarcicon.
Their current trajectory has

35:11.443 --> 35:16.513
them headed into the ucopita quadrant.
What does Tennyson know that I

35:16.515 --> 35:20.784
don't?
>> Silence!

35:26.924 --> 35:30.694
You had better be very sure.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.768
>> This containment device should deflect
the energy fluctuations back into the

35:38.770 --> 35:42.205
omnitrix, while still allowing you full access to the control dials.

35:42.207 --> 35:48.178
>> Ben: Lot of good it does me
if I can't go hero anyway.

35:48.180 --> 35:54.885
>> Gluto, status.
>> Zenon.

35:54.887 --> 36:00.724
>> Ben: Uh, where?
>> Azmuth created a device which absorbs all the light of this

36:00.726 --> 36:04.494
quadrant. Of course,
I was the one who calculated the entire

36:04.496 --> 36:10.333
particle-absorption matrix,
but will he admit that? No.

36:10.335 --> 36:15.505
Anyway, zenon is surrounded by an asteroid belt.
>> Gwen: Which you can't see

36:15.507 --> 36:19.242
because azmuth turned out all the lights.
>> Exactly.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.278
Those are failed attempts.

36:24.582 --> 36:29.719
>> Even gluto can't drive blind.
>> Ben: How are we supposed to

36:29.721 --> 36:38.762
get to zenon if we can't see it? >> The answer is on your wrist.
>> Ben: Uh, explain to me again

36:38.764 --> 36:43.266
what I'm doing out here.
>> The omnitrix has a built-in homing device.

36:43.268 --> 36:48.205
We should be close enough for it to guide us through the asteroid field.

36:48.207 --> 36:51.875
>> "Should be"?
>> Ben: Okay,

36:51.877 --> 36:53.877
this is way creepy.

37:00.785 --> 37:04.921
>> What are you doing?
You have to direct us or the ship will be torn apart.

37:04.923 --> 37:12.462
>> Ben: Oh, great.
No pressure.

37:12.464 --> 37:17.767
It's working!
>> I know, I know, I was going

37:17.769 --> 37:20.737
to.
Should we turn to starboard or port?

37:20.739 --> 37:25.775
>> Ben: What? >> Gwen: He means right or left.
>> Ben: Why didn't he just say

37:25.777 --> 37:30.814
so?
Go to the right.

37:30.816 --> 37:37.821
I mean left! Go left!
>> Gwen: This is why we don't

37:37.823 --> 37:40.624
give him the map when we drive.

38:02.179 --> 38:06.683
>> Ben: I did it!
>> Well done, Ben. >> Ben: Yeah!

38:06.685 --> 38:11.855
>> Come on in.

38:11.857 --> 38:18.628
>> Ben:

38:26.170 --> 38:33.410
A-a-a-a-ah!
>> Vilgax.

38:37.381 --> 38:44.888
>> <i>Surrender the omnitrix and your deaths
will be swift -- except, of course, for the</i>

38:44.890 --> 38:50.560
<i>Tennyson boy.</i> >> We're goners now.
>> Not while I'm in charge.

38:50.562 --> 38:55.398
Ben, I'm sending a gyropod. >> Ben:
I'll just go stink and fly back.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.736
>> No, Ben, we can't afford to accelerate the countdown.
I'm sending the pod.

38:59.738 --> 39:03.873
Gwen, I need you and gluto to
keep him busy for a while.

39:41.679 --> 39:47.016
>> Ben:
What kind of mega-weird alien is this built for? Gluto.

39:47.018 --> 39:50.153
Oh, well.
How hard can it be?

40:19.917 --> 40:28.158
Oh, gross!
Man, where's gluto when you need

40:28.160 --> 40:30.160
him?

40:37.601 --> 40:39.536
>> Ben: A-a-a-h!

40:43.841 --> 40:48.044
Huh?
Oh, yeah, now I got it.

40:55.286 --> 40:59.155
This isn't so tough, once you
figure it out.

41:10.868 --> 41:16.673
One of these has to be a cool
ray gun or something.

41:30.387 --> 41:35.058
>> What are you doing? >> We're going outside.
We need to free the <i>resolute</i>

41:35.060 --> 41:40.330
from vilgax's ship. >> Me?
Outside? I-in space? Oh, no.

41:40.332 --> 41:45.668
I'm more of a land-based species.
>> If we don't clear those

41:45.670 --> 41:50.139
tethers by the time we hit zenon's gravitational pull,
both ships will be destroyed in

41:50.141 --> 41:54.244
re-entry. >> Well,
when you put it <i>that</i> way...

42:02.419 --> 42:07.757
>> It appears we have scared the
pilot right out of his skin.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.398
Stop them!

42:45.396 --> 42:51.301
>> Ben, get back to the ship!
>> Ben: I'm trying! Ugh!

43:12.923 --> 43:16.492
All right!

43:23.634 --> 43:27.503
>> Segma sofum!

43:37.982 --> 43:39.983
Yes! Wipeout!

44:10.147 --> 44:14.250
>> How dare you touch me, you
slime!

44:27.498 --> 44:29.866
>> Ben:

44:38.709 --> 44:40.710
A-a-a-a-ah!

44:44.381 --> 44:49.285
Yeah!
This is better than "sumo slammer" any day!

44:56.393 --> 45:00.830
>> Ben, I'm opening up the rear ramp.
Try to land in the cargo bay.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.799
>> Ben: Okay, I'll try.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.119
Look out!

45:54.585 --> 46:03.459
>> Gwen: Gluto?
Gluto?!

46:12.503 --> 46:14.504
No!

46:21.512 --> 46:23.946
>> Ben: A-a-a-a-ah!

46:31.522 --> 46:35.224
>> Hello... Ben.

46:42.766 --> 46:48.204
>> You are going to regret sending me to
the null void for what little remains of your

46:48.206 --> 46:56.512
miserable life! >> Ben: A-a-a-a-h!
Look, the omnitrix is in

46:56.514 --> 47:00.383
self-destruct mode. Even if you get it from me,
you'll just wind up getting

47:00.385 --> 47:05.922
blown to bits with the rest of the universe.
>> I will take my chances.

47:22.539 --> 47:27.176
>> Ben: I'll make you a deal.
I won't fight you for the

47:27.178 --> 47:31.981
omnitrix, but you have to promise to find
the creator and stop it from self-destructing.

47:31.983 --> 47:40.423
>> I do not make deals! >> Ben:
That's okay. Neither do I.

47:40.425 --> 47:45.027
Say bye-bye, vilgeek!

47:49.199 --> 47:55.471
>> A-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
>> Ben:

48:00.444 --> 48:04.046
Yes!
Aah!

48:08.619 --> 48:13.623
>> Gwen: Come on, you can fly this thing.
It's just like riding a bike...

48:19.129 --> 48:26.736
...a huge, super-high-tech, alien bike.
>> Ben: What are you doing?

48:26.738 --> 48:30.640
>> Gwen: Duh!
I'm trying to keep us from winding up a junk pile on zenon.

48:30.642 --> 48:36.045
Don't just stand there -- help me.
>> Ben: Hey, what happened?

48:36.047 --> 48:40.950
>> Gwen:
Gluto sacrificed himself to save me from one of vilgax's drones.

48:40.952 --> 48:45.588
It's called being totally unselfish -- something you wouldn't understand.

48:45.590 --> 48:50.693
>> Ben: I'm unselfish!
>> Gwen: Yeah, right.

48:56.900 --> 49:00.269
>> Ben: Okay, that's not it.

49:08.812 --> 49:16.319
Have we pulled that one yet?
>> Gwen: I don't think so.

49:30.701 --> 49:32.969
>> Both: Whew!

49:42.112 --> 49:44.080
>> Gwen: Brakes!

49:54.958 --> 49:58.828
>> Both: Aah!
Ugh!

50:09.239 --> 50:15.211
>> Gluto! >> Gwen:
He died trying to save me.

50:15.213 --> 50:17.279
>> We'd better find azmuth.

50:22.753 --> 50:26.455
>> Azmuth's compound is just
through that valley.

50:30.894 --> 50:34.096
>> Gwen: Must be the gardener's day off.
>> Ben: Hello?

50:34.098 --> 50:38.100
Anybody home?
>> Tell me you didn't bring us all the way here for nothing.

50:38.102 --> 50:41.737
>> The compound must have been overrun.
Azmuth was always worried his

50:41.739 --> 50:49.945
lab would be discovered by those
after the omnitrix.

50:49.947 --> 50:59.455
But I thought he was just being paranoid.
>> Any chance he escaped?

50:59.457 --> 51:01.791
>> Gwen: A-a-a-a-ah!

51:07.764 --> 51:09.832
>> Ben: Wildvines!

51:42.099 --> 51:47.937
>> Gwen: Ben, look out!
Help!

51:47.939 --> 51:51.640
Aah! >> Ben: Gwen!
Going hero.

51:51.642 --> 51:54.643
>> Ben, no!
The self-destruct will accelerate!

51:54.645 --> 51:57.012
>> Ben: I don't care!

52:04.321 --> 52:12.928
>> Four arms: >> Gwen: Ben!
>> Four arms: Hold on!

52:12.930 --> 52:21.904
I'm coming!
N-o-o-o-o!

52:31.848 --> 52:38.754
Gwen!

52:41.224 --> 52:50.299
>> Four arms: >> Ben,
she's gone. >> Four arms: No!

52:50.301 --> 52:56.138
I've got to save her! >> There were too many, Ben.
The florauna weren't going to

52:56.140 --> 53:00.643
stop until they had one of us. >> Four arms:
She sacrificed herself to save me.

53:00.645 --> 53:07.216
It should've been me!
It should've been me!

53:07.218 --> 53:09.251
It should've been me!

53:18.995 --> 53:25.234
>> Ben: Ugh. It should've been me.
This is all your fault!

53:25.236 --> 53:28.871
>> <i></i> Fault? >> Ben: Yeah,
if you hadn't helped the creator make this

53:28.873 --> 53:32.942
stupid thing, then I never would have found it,
and Gwen would still be alive!

53:32.944 --> 53:36.345
>> Ben -- >> I am a selfish and self-centered being,
but it

53:36.347 --> 53:41.550
takes one to know one. >> That's enough,
both of you. We still need to find the

53:41.552 --> 53:46.088
creator. Myaxx, if azmuth did survive an attack like that,
where would he

53:46.090 --> 53:48.123
go?

54:00.971 --> 54:03.906
>> Ben: I'm sorry, Gwen.

54:12.582 --> 54:16.619
>> You okay? >> Ben:
Just wondering how I'm gonna tell grandpa about...

54:16.621 --> 54:20.623
>> I'm sorry.
I know what you're going through.

54:20.625 --> 54:26.629
I was young. I didn't care about anybody but myself,
so it made sense that I

54:26.631 --> 54:31.800
wound up a mercenary, a soldier for hire.
I was loyal to whoever paid me

54:31.802 --> 54:36.405
the most, no matter how evil they were.
It was only a matter of time

54:36.407 --> 54:42.077
before I would work for the worst of the worst -- vilgax.
I stole the last piece of the

54:42.079 --> 54:47.316
puzzle vilgax needed to invade my home world.
When my people didn't bow at his

54:47.318 --> 54:52.955
feet, he destroyed the entire planet to make an example out of it.

54:52.957 --> 55:02.665
Vilgax did the dirty work,
but he couldn't have done it without my help.

55:02.667 --> 55:08.203
So when I heard that he was after the omnitrix,
I vowed to never let another powerful

55:08.205 --> 55:13.676
weapon fall into his claws again.
>> Ben: This is all <i>my</i> fault.

55:13.678 --> 55:18.847
I saw that the watch was acting all weird at the reactor,
but i used it anyway.

55:18.849 --> 55:23.686
I must have somehow set off the self-destruct.
Gwen is dead because of me.

55:23.688 --> 55:29.458
Now everyone else will be, too.
>> We both have made costly mistakes, but if we don't find

55:29.460 --> 55:34.563
azmuth and stop the self-destruct,
then Gwen and gluto and all the others will

55:34.565 --> 55:40.903
have lost their lives for nothing,
and we're not going to let that happen, right?

55:44.541 --> 55:46.742
>> Look out!

56:05.228 --> 56:14.403
>> The omnitrix.
What are you doing with my omnitrix?

56:14.405 --> 56:22.010
>> Ben: "My omnitrix"? You? You're the creator?
>> Myaxx, you traitorous worm,

56:22.012 --> 56:25.614
is that you?
>> Nice to see you again, too, boss.

56:25.616 --> 56:31.120
>> Ben: I'm Ben Tennyson.
I wound up with the omnitrix. Now it's in self-destruct

56:31.122 --> 56:34.423
countdown, and -- >> I know.
I invented it!

56:34.425 --> 56:41.263
>> Ben: Oh, yeah. So, anyway,
if you could just turn it off...

56:41.265 --> 56:46.435
>> Maybe Ben didn't make it clear why we're here.
>> I understand completely.

56:46.437 --> 56:51.206
You misused my creation,
and now the whole universe will be destroyed.

56:51.208 --> 56:57.045
>> Ben: Look, I don't know why you don't want to help us,
but my cousin sacrificed her life to

56:57.047 --> 57:08.891
stop this thing. >> That is none of my concern.
>> Ben: It is now.

57:08.893 --> 57:18.634
>> Cannonbolt: Let's roll!
Ugh!

57:18.636 --> 57:22.004
>> That looked like it really
hurt.

57:29.078 --> 57:34.550
>> Cannonbolt: I've come too far,
I've lost too much, to be stopped now.

57:44.661 --> 57:52.968
>> Remind me not to get that kid mad.
>> Cannonbolt: You <i>are</i> going to

57:52.970 --> 57:57.506
turn this thing off!
>> You think you're a hero, but you're a fool.

57:57.508 --> 58:02.611
You only sped up the countdown!
Because of you, the universe has even less time.

58:02.613 --> 58:07.449
>> Cannonbolt: If the universe is going down anyway,
I'm gonna have the pleasure of kicking

58:07.451 --> 58:09.485
your butt first!

58:19.562 --> 58:27.369
>> Look at what you did.
Do you know how long it takes to

58:27.371 --> 58:32.040
break in a bio-suit like that?
>> Cannonbolt: He's really a grey matter?

58:32.042 --> 58:37.045
>> Who knew? >> Yeah, I'm a galvan,
so what? Does that give you the right to

58:37.047 --> 58:40.983
destroy my property and invade my privacy?
>> Enough talk!

58:40.985 --> 58:46.054
Stop the countdown!
>> I say let the omnitrix self-destruct and take the

58:46.056 --> 58:49.658
universe with it.
Best thing that could happen, probably.

58:49.660 --> 58:53.061
Start fresh. I didn't create a weapon.
All of you did.

58:53.063 --> 58:57.766
I created the ultimate device for
understanding all the beings of the universe.

58:57.768 --> 59:03.071
You and vilgax are no different. >> Ben:
That's not true! Sure I've messed around with the

59:03.073 --> 59:08.010
watch, but I've helped a lot of people with it, too.
At first, all I cared about was

59:08.012 --> 59:12.748
that I wouldn't be able to go hero anymore,
that I'd be stuck with just being me.

59:12.750 --> 59:19.755
Sometimes you have to see the good
in people and not just be a selfish jerk.

59:32.602 --> 59:37.973
>> Azmuth!
The creator of the omnitrix.

59:41.578 --> 59:48.450
At last we meet.
What an honor... For you.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.436
>> This ends now!

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:22.384
>> Use it now and we kiss this
half of the universe bye-bye!

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:33.195
>> Why do you continue to defend
the omnitrix when it's hopeless?

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:37.966
I do not understand. >> Ben:
That's because the only thing you think about is

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:43.505
yourself. Now, step off!
I've got a world to save.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:42.097
Gwen! >> Gluto!
>> Both: You're alive!

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:45.934
>> Ben: We thought you were goners!
>> Gwen: Gluto saved me from the

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:50.105
wildvines. Turns out,
gluto's species can regenerate from just the

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:56.111
smallest of parts,
like what was left on my clothes after he went splat.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:58.113
>> Who knew?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.798
>> What have you done? >> Ben:
I ask myself that question all the time.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:57.299
>> I'm still not sure the
universe is worth saving, but

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.768
while I think about it...

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:25.594
>> Ben: It's over, vilgax!
The watch is deactivated. It's useless now.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:31.499
>> But the creator of the omnitrix is not.
You will build me an even more

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:35.270
powerful device.

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.538
>> Gwen: What would you do without me?
>> Ben: Sure am glad I don't

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.643
have to find out. >> Gwen:
What's that? >> Ben: I said, vilgax is

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:18.480
smearing us, and I can't do anything without it.
I'm just a plain kid without the

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:22.717
omnitrix. >> Gwen: don't you get it?
You don't need that thing.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:28.056
What about all the times you saved grandpa or
me or lots of other people when you weren't an

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:35.497
alien? You are a hero,
even if you can't <i>go</i> hero.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:39.634
>> Ben: What gives?
I thought you pulled the plug on this thing and couldn't turn it

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:44.205
back on.
>> Who told you that? Not me.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:54.182
>> Ben: All right!
I'm back in the alien-hero business!

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:57.886
>> Here, try this alien on for
size.

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:26.815
>> Gwen: That's a big alien. >> Way big: Whoa!
Check me out! I'm not just big, I'm way big!

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:04.085
>> Leaving?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:17.932
Release me or suffer the
consequences!

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:24.672
>> Way big: Pretty big talk from
such a little guy.

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:28.243
That's it!
You are <i>so</i> outta here!

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:37.819
>> A-a-a-a-a-ah!

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:48.263
>> Ben: What are you doing?
>> Improvising a ride. This place is getting too noisy

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:52.600
for me. >> Ben: Mr.
Azmuth, I just wanted to thank you for fixing

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:56.037
the omnitrix.
If you want it back, it is yours.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:02.744
>> I created the omnitrix to help all the
beings of the universe grow closer together.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:08.950
If an earthling can make that happen,
then I see no reason why he shouldn't have it.

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:13.488
Besides, that thing is nothing but trouble,
always has been. You keep it.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:21.763
Good riddance! You coming?
>> Are you going to give me some

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:27.001
respect from now on? >> Eh,
I wouldn't count on it. >> I guess it is better than

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:33.841
that prison planet. >> Ben:
Wait -- you have to tell me how to work this thing.

01:08:33.844 --> 01:08:38.345
>> Don't you want to figure it out on your own -- like a true hero would?

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:43.651
>> Ben: Hmm. Not really.
>> I like that boy.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.660
>> Ben: Oh, man!
We'd better be heading back home.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:58.198
It'll be nice to have a little normal time after all this.
Yo, snotty, think you can drive

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:05.506
us back to earth? >> No problem!
>> Ben: You can speak English,

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:10.879
and you understand everything I've said?
>> Oh, yeah!

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:19.220
Snot blob! >> Who knew?
>> Ben: I have a feeling it's

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:26.828
gonna be a long trip back home. >> Gwen:
Thanks for the ride! >> Ben: And the cool gift!

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.763
Visit soon!

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:37.705
>> Max: Well, after an adventure like that,
bet you guys are looking forward to a nice,

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:42.710
normal day. >> Ben: Oh. Yeah.
We should go to the mall and go

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:48.349
shopping for clothes and junk.
>> <i>We interrupt regular broadcasting for this emergency</i>

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.986
<i>report.</i>
<i>A horde of what appears to be zombies are attacking the mall.</i>

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:56.591
<i>Citizens are advised to stay clear of the area.</i>
>> Gwen: Ah, guess this is a

01:09:56.593 --> 01:10:03.565
normal day for us. >> Ben:
This is the best summer ever!

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:06.534
It's hero time!
