23:04.168 --> 23:06.923
with friends near the house, and my daughter
overheard it.

23:07.026 --> 23:08.781
They are only five to seven years.

23:08.885 --> 23:11.192
I know she did not do it on
purpose, but ...

23:11.296 --> 23:13.210
- I talk to her.

23:13.314 --> 23:15.562

23:15.667 --> 23:18.739
You know, it is her fifteenth anniversary a few days ago.

23:18.843 --> 23:21.125
My daughter is having nightmares again.

23:21.228 --> 23:22.828
I'm sorry about that.

23:31.649 --> 23:33.173

23:36.579 --> 23:39.161

Okay, thank you.

23:39.265 --> 23:41.615

43:20.507 --> 43:24.800
On a certain point, he simply refused to

In his mind, he was not

43:27.162 --> 43:29.252
He couldnt killed his wife and family.

43:29.359 --> 43:30.865

There is no evidence that against you.

01:07:52.979 --> 01:07:55.347
So I need let you go.

01:07:57.936 --> 01:07:59.406

01:08:12.081 --> 01:08:14.417
Or the truth.

01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:16.270
You think I did it?

01:08:17.587 --> 01:08:19.738
I honestly do not know.

I dont care what my mind trying to do.

01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:25.689
I have to find out who killed my family,
Even if it was me..

01:08:26.444 --> 01:08:30.982
If you admit yourself here now
under my care, I can treat you.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.437
You're not well, Peter.

01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:35.658

- Good night, Daddy.

01:10:26.529 --> 01:10:29.156
Tell me what you know that night.

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:31.635
I do not want to do this.

01:10:37.144 --> 01:10:40.565
I remember when I heard someone on the stairs and
I come out.

01:10:40.657 --> 01:10:42.234
I cant do this.

01:10:42.326 --> 01:10:42.956
- You heard someone on the stairs ...
- And I come out, because I knew it's was you.

01:10:42.956 --> 01:10:45.565
You remember when they were shot?
- You heard someone on the stairs ...
- And I come out, because I knew it's was you.

01:10:45.565 --> 01:10:46.654
- You heard someone on the stairs ...
- And I come out, because I knew it's was you.

01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:51.714
And then I fell. ...

01:10:56.354 --> 01:10:58.816
And the kids were...

01:10:59.484 --> 01:11:03.322
lying there.
They're so still.

01:11:05.033 --> 01:11:10.405
I know them going away and I
need me to take care of themselves.

01:11:10.505 --> 01:11:12.451
So I went with them.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.105
And then ...

01:11:21.255 --> 01:11:23.045
An then ...

01:11:25.383 --> 01:11:28.886
I found those flowers, and I
painting infront hall.

01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:32.049
And it was snowing and
I worry you not making home.

01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:33.951
but you did.

01:11:36.685 --> 01:11:40.983
What else?
What else do you remember?

01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:44.880
I do not remember anything.

01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:48.507
- You shot me.
- No.

01:11:48.607 --> 01:11:51.859
No, I shot the man,
who shot the girls..

01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:53.677
- You shot me.
- No.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:58.471
What is that?

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.929
This is a scar.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.163
Why?

01:12:11.665 --> 01:12:13.782
I'm sorry.

01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:21.738
Peter, are you there?

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.694
Peter.

01:12:39.545 --> 01:12:42.468
You've get out of here.

01:12:44.738 --> 01:12:47.200
Are you tell me the truth?

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:49.286
I tried to tell you in Greenhaven.

01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.228
- Tell me what?
- Everything.

01:12:51.328 --> 01:12:54.491
Libby and children their gone.

01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:59.550
Libby is dead and you need to let them go.

01:13:01.793 --> 01:13:04.667
Is a mistake to come back here.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.970
You cant stay in this house, Peter.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:10.195
It drive you crazy.

01:13:12.218 --> 01:13:14.259

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:17.301
Tell me how she died?

01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:24.296
Libby loved you.

01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:30.014
She wants you to let her go.

01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:37.841
You have to let her go now, Peter.

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:45.599
Hye, where are you? I heard you coming.
Is you down the stairs?

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:48.242
I'm outside the house.

01:13:48.599 --> 01:13:50.337
Daddy's home.

01:13:53.351 --> 01:13:54.861

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.773

01:13:59.873 --> 01:14:01.854

01:14:08.897 --> 01:14:10.941

01:14:11.066 --> 01:14:13.570

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.953

01:16:42.165 --> 01:16:46.431
