WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:04.376
Perfect. Okay, I'll see you
Sunday. Bye! (GIGGLES)

00:04.671 --> 00:05.957
Damn, girl. You're
planning the straight Hizzell

00:06.256 --> 00:07.121
out of that block party.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.755
"Hizzell?"

00:09.051 --> 00:10.212
(LOWERED VOICE) Are
we just gonna let that slide?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.252
(INAUDIBLE)
ALEX: It's gonna be great.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.636
I'm gonna have a deejay in front
of my store, bands, Dave's truck...

00:14.932 --> 00:16.388
And I will be unveiling
the new and improved version

00:16.683 --> 00:17.844
of my classic
steak sandwich.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.429
| call it "steak-point-0."

00:21.563 --> 00:22.519
(LOWERED VOICE) So we
are just letting everything slide?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.396
BRAD: Oy. Um...

00:24.691 --> 00:26.602
Okay, does everyone have something
to contribute for the silent auction?

00:26.902 --> 00:29.018
| will be donating
a free PR consultation.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.312
Oh. So Penny's
offering nothing.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.447
I'll be donating three
centerpieces handmade by me,

00:33.742 --> 00:34.732
perfect for any occasion.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.072
A dinner party,
holiday gathering,

00:37.371 --> 00:39.954
centerpiece hall of fame
induction ceremony.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.614
Thanks, Jane. You make
the best centerpieces.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.998
(WHISPERS) I know.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.374
Oh.
Hey, buddy.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.455
How was the funeral?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.040
Sad.
Mmm-hmm.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.829
Mark was a great
hairdresser

00:49.132 --> 00:50.793
and a great guy.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.800
42 years young,
and then... Pfft. Dead.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.421
But the real tragedy is...

00:56.723 --> 00:58.509
| need a haircut, and I
ain't got no place to go.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.641
Yeah, that's definitely
the real tragedy here.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.176
What about my barbershop?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.810
Nah. I can't keep arguing
with those guys

01:04.105 --> 01:05.642
about Tyler Perry movies
anymore.

01:05.941 --> 01:06.851
Black folks like
Tyler Perry, Max.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.857
No, I love
Tyler Perry movies.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.143
It's Ray-Ray and Tooches
that think it's implausible

01:11.446 --> 01:13.107
for Madea to keep
going back to prison.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.318
But like I told them,
mama got tax problems.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.778
You should go see
Krisjahn. ALEX: Yeah.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.112
Alex and I have been
going to him for years.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.402
Chris John?

01:19.705 --> 01:20.740
No. Krisjahn.
Christian.

01:21.039 --> 01:21.574
Mmm-mmm.
No. Krisjahn.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.911
K-R-1-S-J-A-H-N.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.575
Krisjahn. Very common
gay-fake-French name.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.834
DAVE: No, no, Max.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.371
You're a man, like me.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.257
You need to go to a man
who cuts man hair man-style.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.384
Trust me. I got a guy.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.919
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:37.222 --> 01:39.338
Hey, guys.
(GASPS) Sacrebleu!

01:39.641 --> 01:41.928
Dude, you look like Suze
Orman if she stopped shaving.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.513
You look like a keytar player
in a Christian rock band.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.223
JANE: You look like Alf.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.433
You look like an assistant
manager at a Jacksonville multiplex.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.393
| think I need
Chris John's number.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.559
ALL: Krisjahn.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.604
Wait. Am I seriously
the only one feeling this?

01:54.906 --> 01:55.646
Ugh.
Yes.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.652
ALL: Ugh!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.316
BOTH: (TOGETHER) What?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.360
ALL: Ugh!
BOTH: (TOGETHER) What?

02:00.662 --> 02:01.197
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

02:11.256 --> 02:13.213
Okay, taste testers,

02:13.508 --> 02:15.124
steak me home tonight
and Dave Rose,

02:15.427 --> 02:17.088
in conjunction with beef
and cheese, proudly present...

02:18.472 --> 02:19.633
The steak-point-0.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.012
Mmm.
Yay.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.716
Mmm-mmm. No.
No. No.

02:24.019 --> 02:24.929
Ugh. Nope
steak-point-no. Mmm-mmm.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.139
Sorry, but that
tastes like...

02:27.439 --> 02:28.804
Outside.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.895
If you made tea out of a taxi
driver's underpants and then...

02:32.194 --> 02:33.810
No. Fart paper.
(WHISPERS) Yes.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.602
That is definitely
fart paper.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.522
Am I tasting a hard
yogurt? Is that a thing?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.110
That is nowhere near
as good as hard yogurt.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.025
Dave, what happened to
your old sandwich? It was great.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.739
(SINGSONG) Boring!

02:43.038 --> 02:44.449
| gotta mix it up
a little bit, all right?

02:44.748 --> 02:45.704
I'm not getting
any new customers,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.410
| got zero tweets,

02:47.709 --> 02:49.120
and the only review on Yelp
| got was from my mom,

02:49.419 --> 02:50.705
when she thought
she was e-mailing me.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.290
"Davey, what's the name
of that movie

02:52.589 --> 02:54.045
"about the horse
that goes to the war?"

02:54.341 --> 02:57.129
Uh, "War biscuit."
(SCOFFS) duh.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.134
Say, Dave, since |
just did you a favor

02:59.429 --> 03:00.419
by eating
your gross sandwich,

03:00.722 --> 03:01.757
I'd like a favor
in return.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.593
See, I just bought
this new armoire...

03:03.892 --> 03:05.758
Well, it's been years since I
appraised anything, but I guess I...

03:06.061 --> 03:08.177
No, I was hoping to borrow
your truck to move it to my place.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.936
Yeah. Sure.
You need any help?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.314
No, thanks. I've got
Alex and Jane. Oh.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.895
We used to move mattresses
for our dad's store in the summer.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.776
Ah, we made bank.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.277
Remember that guy
who tipped us extra

03:17.572 --> 03:19.108
because we agreed to dress
up as his dead daughters?

03:19.408 --> 03:20.398
Jeffrey!
We're facebook friends.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.281
Ah! Send me the link
to that page.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.737
Oh, he'll love that.
Hmm.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.993
Okay. Well,
the truck's all yours.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.904
But beware. She has some
quirks. (OPENS DRAWER)

03:27.207 --> 03:28.914
Now this unlocks the door.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.495
Okay.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.707
And this starts the engine.
(CLOSES DRAWER)

03:34.005 --> 03:35.120
Oh, and when
you honk the horn,

03:35.424 --> 03:37.040
she plays "Someone's
in the kitchen with Dinah."”

03:37.342 --> 03:39.174
Why?
Because...

03:39.469 --> 03:42.006
J Someone's in the kitchen
with David

03:42.305 --> 03:44.467
IS Chompin' on a steak sando,
oh, oh J

03:44.766 --> 03:46.723
Dave, you are one of my
oldest friends... Mmm-hmm.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.180
But if we met now,
we'd be enemies.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.765
(SINGSONG)
Thanks for the truck! Bye!

03:52.733 --> 03:55.145
Oh, thank you so much
for helping me, Krisjahn.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.527
Anything for a friend
of Alex and Jane's.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.280
Sit back, relax, and we'll
have you looking more "Max"

04:01.575 --> 04:04.033
and less "retired air
force lesbian" in no time.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.409
Ah, gay wit...

04:06.705 --> 04:08.616
The white noise
of the hair salon.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.704
So... How is Alex's
block party coming along?

04:13.003 --> 04:14.209
Is that what's happening
this week?

04:14.504 --> 04:15.835
...have not
been paying attention.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.293
Jane doesn't think Alex can pull
it off "cause she's such a flake.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.082
Hmm?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.127
And Alex thinks Jane's
centerpieces are, quote,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.512
"Pieces from the center
of a person's butt."

04:25.807 --> 04:27.013
What?

04:27.309 --> 04:29.016
"And that person
is not well, darling."

04:29.311 --> 04:30.722
Do they talk
that kind of trash

04:31.021 --> 04:32.603
behind each other's backs
to you?

04:32.898 --> 04:35.310
They've been bitch-hissing
about each other to me for years,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.065
and not just
the small stuff.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.942
Oh! Now well,
don't stop there!

04:39.237 --> 04:40.022
Give me all the good
stuff, fellow Gaylord.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.357
You want something big?

04:41.656 --> 04:42.066
Oh, I want something
big, girl.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.947
Okay. Um...

04:44.242 --> 04:46.700
Jane thinks Alex is a
disappointment to their parents.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.532
That...is...awesome.
(LAUGHS)

04:49.831 --> 04:51.117
Well, get this. Alex... Uh-huh?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.373
...says that Jane is
only into black guys...

04:53.668 --> 04:55.534
Uh-huh? Because
she lost her virginity

04:55.837 --> 04:57.794
at the drive-in screening
of Big Momma's House.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.955
Oh! Hallelujah!

05:00.258 --> 05:01.748
This is like
gay Christmas!

05:02.052 --> 05:03.463
Oh, hold up.
That's the Oscars.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.422
Right. Yes.
Yeah.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.210
Of course. I'm sorry.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.963
Dude, check it out.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.756
So I went to Krisjahn
to get my hair fixed...

05:10.060 --> 05:12.017
That's fixed?
(GRUNTS) Whatever. Anyway...

05:12.312 --> 05:15.100
He told me
about all this trash

05:15.398 --> 05:18.140
that Alex and Jane have been
talking about each other there for years.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.811
| mean, really hurtful,
venge-filled, soul-crushing stuff.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.569
It was hilarious.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.572
Yep. I know all
about it. You do?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.528
That's how the Kerkoviches
deal with their stuff.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.489
They talk to someone else,
never each other.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.199
(SCOFFS) That is the
dumbest thing I've ever heard,

05:31.498 --> 05:32.613
and I've heard Alex and
Dave talk about the civil war.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.702
Well, that's what they do.

05:35.001 --> 05:35.911
| mean, Alex and Jane tried
being honest with each other

05:36.211 --> 05:37.542
like, 20 years ago.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.044
The fight lasted
for weeks.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.171
The family never
talks about it.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.297
They just call it...
(SUSPENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

05:42.592 --> 05:44.048
"The incident.”

05:44.344 --> 05:46.005
(EXHALES)
(MUSIC STOPS)

05:46.304 --> 05:48.170
That sounds amazing.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.636
Dude... Do not
stir this up.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.471
| don't need any
more drama, all right?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.010
Seriously, I just
watched Nurse Jackie,

05:55.313 --> 05:56.678
and I cannot handle any
more drama right now.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.097
Of course not.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.482
Thanks. Wait.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.642
Are you doing that thing
where you say, "Of course not,"

06:01.945 --> 06:02.559
and then
you go do it anyway?

06:02.863 --> 06:03.648
| would never
do that to you, man.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.445
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.447
Wait.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.153
Now are you doing
that thing where you say,

06:09.452 --> 06:10.738
"I'd never do
that to you, man"

06:11.037 --> 06:12.869
after I've questioned the
sincerity of your "of course not"?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.950
Of course not. | would
never do that to you, man.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.116
Thanks, man. Wait!

06:18.795 --> 06:19.705
| like your hair.

06:20.005 --> 06:20.665
Thanks.
I'm lying.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.084
(SIGHS)

06:23.383 --> 06:24.339
Thank you, guys,
SO much

06:24.634 --> 06:25.999
for helping me
with the armoire.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.795
| guess you could say you're
my knights in shining armoire.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.180
Or you could not say it.
Up to you.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.681
I'm not your mouth boss. Mmm.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.342
But seriously, thank you.
(CLEARING THROAT)

06:35.645 --> 06:37.056
Well, thank, uh,
muscle-boobs over here.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.766
She did most
of the work.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.433
(STRAINED VOICE) |
got it. It's all good. | got this.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.521
It's all n the legs...
From yay to hay. Mmm.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.691
Wait. Didn't we park
Dave's truck right here?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.364
JANE: Yeah.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.946
Wait. Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

06:52.245 --> 06:53.656
Do you know what this
means? Ghost truck?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.117
No, it means that
Dave's truck was stolen.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.908
Right! Of course.
of course. (CHUCKLES)

06:59.210 --> 06:59.915
(SLAPS THIGH)
Ghosts don't drive.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.710
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.379
Dave?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.087
I've got some bad news.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.425
(KNIFE THUDS) Oh, my God. Something
happened to Dave Matthews, didn't it?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.011
It did, didn't it?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.721
(VOICE BREAKS) | had that
weird dream, and now he's gone...

07:17.020 --> 07:18.510
Stop it! No, Dave Matthews
is fine. | mean, he's puffy

07:18.813 --> 07:19.894
and he sounds like he's
got a squirrel in his mouth,

07:20.190 --> 07:21.726
but he's fine.
Thank god.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.186
Someone stole your truck.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.691
What? | don't know
what happened.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.852
| locked the doors, | took the
screwdriver out of the ignition,

07:27.155 --> 07:29.522
| put it on the dash... You left
the screwdriver on the dash?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.155
That's practically an
invitation to steal it!

07:31.451 --> 07:32.987
| am so, so sorry.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.492
(SIGHS) Oh!
What am I gonna do?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.903
That truck
was my livelihood!

07:36.206 --> 07:37.537
How am I gonna
pay the bills?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.994
| can't go back to being
a wild turkey shot boy.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.330
I've put on weight. | don't have
the legs to be a little gobbler.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.994
Well, we should
call the cops.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.709
No. No, don't be naive. The
cops don't find stolen cars.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.918
Plus they only help
white people.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.083
I'm sorry?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.753
I'm 1/16th Navajo.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.511
Well, we should at least go
out and try to find your truck.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.763
| mean,
we found your clogs

07:55.058 --> 07:56.389
that time you left them
at the duck pond.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.393
(SIGHS) all right.
Fine, let's go find it.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.305
But in the off-off chance that
we do find it... (OPENS DRAWER)

08:02.607 --> 08:03.347
I'm gonna bring my spare
key. (CLOSES DRAWER)

08:07.862 --> 08:09.444
| screwed the pooch.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.026
(DOOR CLOSES)
| wined it, I dined it,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.486
| told it it was cute and
that I valued its opinions,

08:13.785 --> 08:14.695
even though I don't,
and then I screwed it.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.783
Um... What are you
talking about?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.197
Okay, I was at Krisjahn's with
Jane, and then Alex came in.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.161
And then they started
complimenting each other... (GASPS)

08:22.460 --> 08:23.700
About the block party
and the centerpieces and...

08:24.004 --> 08:25.119
No. Tell me you didn't.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.708
| did.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.623
| told them all the things
that Krisjahn told me.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.131
All the smack.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.087
Damn you, you Kevin
Smith smell-alike!

08:32.386 --> 08:33.342
But it was super funny!

08:33.638 --> 08:34.924
Then it got super scary,

08:35.222 --> 08:36.554
like when my grandpa
got on that trampoline.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.181
And much like
Pop Irving,

08:38.476 --> 08:40.058
they're not gonna stop
till they're dead.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.013
| can't believe
you did this.

08:42.063 --> 08:42.928
I'm gonna be sick.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.596
| didn't...

08:44.899 --> 08:46.060
| didn't... Oh, wait.
Oh, God. (GAGS)

08:46.359 --> 08:47.849
It's your fault!
Ugh!

08:48.153 --> 08:49.393
| mean, you practically
begged me to do it

08:49.696 --> 08:51.186
by begging me
not to do it.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.480
In fact, sir, | would like
an apology. | am hurt.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.694
| am deeply hurt that you
do not know me well enough

08:55.994 --> 08:57.280
to know that I would
screw this up for you.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.161
You have no idea what
you've just started, Max.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.992
People are going
to get hurt,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.282
family members
forced to take sides,

09:03.585 --> 09:05.792
innocent Brads yelled at
and denied sex for weeks!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.293
(GASPS)

09:07.589 --> 09:08.704
Winter is coming.

09:09.007 --> 09:09.997
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

09:10.300 --> 09:12.132
Well...
Good luck with that.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.464
(GRUFF VOICE) No!
Okay.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.299
You are gonna
help me fix this.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.509
Me?
(SCREECHES)

09:18.808 --> 09:20.924
Okay! I'll clean up
your mess.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.558
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I'd still like that apology.

09:22.854 --> 09:23.969
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREECH) Ah!

09:24.272 --> 09:24.852
Fair enough.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.024
Penny, this isn't gonna
work. The truck is gone.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.060
Plus the flyer's
kinda misleading.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.602
Looks like I'm the one
that's lost, not the truck.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.896
No, it doesn't.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.066
Hey. I found
your lost guy.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.905
No, the guy is not lost.
The truck is lost.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.287
You know, your flyer's
kind of misleading.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.117
(CLENCHED TEETH)
Told you.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.827
So about the reward...

09:45.126 --> 09:45.786
The reward is
for the truck.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.201
(TRUCK HONKING)

09:47.504 --> 09:49.620
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You know what that is.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.958
Oh! Oh! Okay! Whoal! You know
what that is? You know what that is?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.873
Is that what |
think it is? Whoa!

09:53.176 --> 09:54.962
(GASPS)
My truck!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.376
PENNY: Some guy is selling
sandwiches out of your truck!

09:56.679 --> 09:58.135
Son of a bitch!

09:58.431 --> 09:59.921
Look at how busy he is!
(SCOFFS)

10:00.225 --> 10:01.761
Hey. I found
your lost truck.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.679
Okay, you guys are
in a stupid lady fight.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.597
We get it.
You're ladies.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.516
Your brains are tiny
and filled with eggs.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.150
Let's just move on.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.356
What my pear-shaped
colleague is trying to say...

10:14.656 --> 10:16.067
Whoa. "Pear-shaped?" |
just bought a medicine ball.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.856
You two are sisters, okay?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.991
You've shared
SO many good times,

10:20.286 --> 10:21.447
like that summer at
the lake in high school.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.952
Remember that?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.784
(SIGHS) Oh, yeah.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.448
Yeah!

10:26.751 --> 10:29.869
Good times!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

10:30.171 --> 10:31.536
Till I was grounded because Alex
ratted me out for smoking cloves.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.330
| am not a rat!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.419
Mom knew you were smoking
'cause you smelt like an ashtray

10:35.718 --> 10:36.879
and your voice was deeper
than Dad's.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.293
(DEEP VOICE) You shut up!
There it is.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.007
Guys, come on.
You're adults, okay?

10:41.224 --> 10:41.679
Can't you just
talk this out?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.300
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

10:45.603 --> 10:48.891
Yes. Yes. yeah,
talk it right out.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.146
Okay, I'm prepared, too. MAX:
Where did you get that from?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.102
Oh! I'm prepared, girl!

10:52.402 --> 10:53.984
Bring it! We can
talk... Oh, I will bring it!

10:54.279 --> 10:55.235
| will! I'm gonna bring it! (MAX
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

10:55.530 --> 10:57.237
Come on, lady!
Bring it!

10:57.532 --> 10:58.818
And I'm gonna end you!
ALEX: Whoa!

10:59.117 --> 10:59.948
BRAD: She's making
nunchakus! Abort!

11:00.243 --> 11:02.154
(SHOUTING)
(ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE)

11:02.453 --> 11:03.909
<i>BRAD: Whoa! Whoa!
separate 'em! ow!</i>

11:04.205 --> 11:05.866
(ALL SHOUTING AT SAME TIME)

11:06.166 --> 11:07.406
You were adopted!

11:07.709 --> 11:08.540
You were born a man!

11:10.795 --> 11:12.001
Can you believe this?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.583
(MOUTH FULL) I know!

11:13.882 --> 11:15.748
This is the best steak
sandwich I've ever had!

11:16.050 --> 11:17.506
Wait. You went over there,

11:17.802 --> 11:18.758
face-to-face with the guy
who stole your truck,

11:19.053 --> 11:20.043
and you bought a sandwich
from him?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.882
No. No.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.014
No, I bought two.
What?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.765
Pen, I have been
struggling to create a sando

11:26.060 --> 11:27.175
that'll get people excited.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.060
Well, this guy did it!

11:29.355 --> 11:30.686
And the truck is killing
on Twitter and Yelp.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.768
Look. "amazing sandwiches."

11:33.067 --> 11:34.228
"My new favorite truck.”

11:34.527 --> 11:35.483
"Davey, don't go
to salad bars.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.859
"I saw something
on the news."

11:37.155 --> 11:38.020
All right, that's another
one from my mom,

11:38.323 --> 11:39.438
but you get the point.

11:39.741 --> 11:40.776
Well, she's right
about the salad bars.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.157
Hobos eat out of those
things with their own silverware.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.615
But, Dave, this jerk
stole your truck,

11:45.914 --> 11:48.030
and now by some miracle
we have found it.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.700
It is obvious
what we have to do...

11:51.002 --> 11:52.458
Take back the truck. Eat these
sandwiches till we figure out the recipe.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.455
No, you're right.
Yeah. Take back the truck.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.713
What are we
gonna do, man?

12:01.012 --> 12:01.672
If Jane and Alex
keep fighting like this,

12:01.971 --> 12:02.756
someone's gonna
get killed.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.217
They'll end up in prison.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.347
Illinois doesn't allow
conjugal visits!

12:06.643 --> 12:09.180
The best I'll do is Jane spitting on
my neck through a chain-link fence.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.435
You could do worse.
(SCREECHES)

12:10.730 --> 12:11.811
All right!
Fine, fine, fine, fine!

12:12.106 --> 12:13.517
How did their
first fight end?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.557
(STRAINED VOICE)
| don't know.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.277
but they're on
a Fox news cruise.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.439
Right now they're dolphin
hunting with Geraldo Rivera.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.359
Wait. Jane's in charge of all the
Kerkovich family photos and stuff.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.572
She keeps them
in a storage unit.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.078
Great! To the Max mobile!

12:29.374 --> 12:30.705
By which, of course, | mean your
Prius, which I sometimes sleep in.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.667
That's so sad.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.874
Ah! Hee! (GROANS)

12:38.591 --> 12:40.798
(SIGHS)
Ah, stupid flashlight!

12:41.094 --> 12:43.210
Why you so stupid
all the time?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.674
MAX: You know | almost
lived in one of these?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.180
Then I found an abandoned
tugboat, and it was way cheaper.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.263
Great story, Max. Great.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.222
BRAD: (HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)
Ahh! Ahh!

12:52.522 --> 12:54.513
He got me! Help me!
Help me, Oprah!

12:54.816 --> 12:56.056

13:05.326 --> 13:07.067
And he's anatomically
correct.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.656
Why would Jane have
one of these?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.491
| don't know, and I
don't want to talk about it.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.906
Really? 'Cause it is all
| wanna talk about.

13:13.209 --> 13:13.698
Can we just do what we
came here to do, man?

13:14.002 --> 13:14.742
Yes. Sorry.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.665
Stop looking at him.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.750
Okay, the incident
happened in 1993.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.794
This place is so organized.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.129
It's totally
taking the fun out

13:24.429 --> 13:25.794
of searching through
a creepy storage space.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.053
Less yappin' and
more findin', brah.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.838
Mmm-hmm.

grade book reports.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.271
Yeah, she dumb.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.439
Oh!

13:45.742 --> 13:47.073
Look.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.073
Articles from
their neighborhood paper.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.609
What? Yes!

13:49.912 --> 13:51.448
Sweet. Okay.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.115
"Sisters fight
in grocery store?" No.

"Sisters burn down
family garage?"

13:59.630 --> 14:00.791
| gotta tell ya, | don't know
what is more disturbing...

14:01.090 --> 14:02.501
How much chaos
Alex and Jane have caused

14:02.800 --> 14:04.711
or how much attention this
paper paid to two little girls.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.501
Oh! "Sisters make peace."

14:07.930 --> 14:08.920
Yes! That's it.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.679
Jackpotty.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.591
Now come on. The block
party starts in 12 hours.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.931
They'll both be there.
Yeah.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.812
Hey, why does this thing
have a motor on the back?

don't want to talk about it, man!

14:23.946 --> 14:25.607
Thanks. Come again.

a dirty crook!

restore this truck to its rightful owner.

You stole Dave's truck!

Yeah, my truck!

14:37.543 --> 14:38.783
Although,
that being said,

14:39.087 --> 14:40.623

this playfulness.

can't stop smiling.

what you guys are talking about.

That's my sink,
this is my grill,

14:49.472 --> 14:50.462

of you...

14:50.765 --> 14:52.221
(WHISPERS) Crap!

14:52.517 --> 14:55.009
How did you think you were gonna
get away with stealing Dave's truck

14:55.311 --> 14:57.769
and then serving sandwiches
out of it in the same neighborhood?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.305
| didn't think.
| just felt.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.849
Meat is an instrument,
and I wanted to play it,

15:03.152 --> 15:05.894
so I did, 'cause |
live my life like jazz.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.154
Right on, man.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.484

You give me the recipe.
