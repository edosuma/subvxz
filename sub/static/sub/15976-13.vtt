WEBVTT

00:00.159 --> 00:02.769
A factory mix-up
with the voice box

00:02.771 --> 00:04.570
of popular Girlfriends doll
Randi Jenkins

00:04.572 --> 00:06.872
has caused the company
to issue a recall.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.039
Look, Mommy!

00:08.041 --> 00:09.774
Oh, let's see what
she says, honey.

00:09.776 --> 00:10.842
Kill Mommy!

00:12.245 --> 00:16.079
Now, though the company insists
that the doll was simply saying,

00:16.082 --> 00:18.182
the Spanish phrase,
"Quiero, Mami,"

00:18.184 --> 00:22.785
it has left a lot of frightened
families saying, "No comprendé."

00:22.787 --> 00:24.053
At least you know

00:24.055 --> 00:26.187
this little girl will have
a future in horror films.

00:26.189 --> 00:28.789
This is a disaster
for the company.

00:28.791 --> 00:30.857
It's worse than the time
Barbie said math was hard.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.158
Math is the least
of her worries.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.493
She lives in Malibu.
It's always on fire.

00:33.495 --> 00:36.462
We need your help. Randi Jenkins
was our-our top seller,

00:36.464 --> 00:38.530
and-and we are not
going to let her...

00:38.532 --> 00:42.499
you go down without a fight.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.735
Well, uh, perhaps America
just needs to be reminded

00:44.737 --> 00:46.903
what a national treasure
you have here in Randi,

00:46.905 --> 00:50.905
and how her eyes...
which never seem to leave you...

00:50.907 --> 00:52.506
- uh, light up a room.
- Great.

00:52.508 --> 00:54.040
We can rehab her, Garrett.

00:54.042 --> 00:55.941
Would you like some tea?
America loves a second act.

00:55.943 --> 00:57.276
I mean, who among us
hasn't recovered

00:57.278 --> 00:58.810
from an ill-timed
Katrina pun

00:58.812 --> 01:01.078
or flashing the fertile crescent
while getting out of a limo?

01:01.080 --> 01:02.580
If I could learn not to wear

01:02.582 --> 01:04.781
a kilt to a business meeting,
little Randi can learn

01:04.783 --> 01:07.083
to keep her murderous
thoughts to herself.

01:07.085 --> 01:09.184
Yeah, move over Adam Levine,
see ya later, big guy.

01:09.186 --> 01:10.552
America's got a new sweetheart.

01:10.554 --> 01:13.320
How about this? A national
apology tour with Randi Jenkins

01:13.322 --> 01:15.388
- as the grand marshal.
- Yeah, we can do

01:15.390 --> 01:16.623
mall appearances, radio spots.

01:16.625 --> 01:17.723
Essentially reintroduce her

01:17.725 --> 01:18.991
- to the country.
- Randi loved malls.

01:18.993 --> 01:20.259
So what do you say?

01:20.261 --> 01:22.326
Are you ready for us to
dig you out of the hole

01:22.328 --> 01:24.094
that Randi's little
potty mouth has put you in?

01:24.096 --> 01:25.828
We need the campaign by Friday.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.263
Done and done.

01:27.265 --> 01:30.364
Well, then I guess
it's safe to say

01:30.366 --> 01:33.067
all eight of us
are in agreement.

01:33.069 --> 01:34.468
- Okay.
- One, two, three,

01:34.470 --> 01:37.736
four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:38.905 --> 01:40.939
Mister, are you a doll?

01:42.142 --> 01:44.508
A lot of people think I am.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.975
Can I touch your hair?

01:45.977 --> 01:50.112
Uh, yeah, just, uh, be careful.

01:53.782 --> 01:56.416
Uh, I think this is yours.

01:56.418 --> 01:58.785

02:14.470 --> 02:16.105
Good morning.

02:16.107 --> 02:17.640
Hello.

02:17.642 --> 02:19.508
You're looking pretty chipper.

02:19.510 --> 02:20.875
Have another dream
about One Direction?

02:20.877 --> 02:22.643
No, and I told you
that in confidence.

02:22.645 --> 02:25.012
And every one of those boys
is of legal age now,

02:25.014 --> 02:27.148
so it's not even wrong.
Yeah, I'm in a good mood,

02:27.150 --> 02:28.783
but we don't have
to talk about it.

02:28.785 --> 02:31.018
Oh, it's about a guy.
Come on, Syd.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.240
We're friends. We're past
all that weird stuff.

02:33.258 --> 02:33.994
You can tell me.

02:34.012 --> 02:35.078
It is not a big deal.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.380
I just have a first date
with some guy on Friday.

02:37.382 --> 02:39.016
Some guy?!
He's a doctor and so hot.

02:39.018 --> 02:40.684
They met a month ago
at a party,

02:40.686 --> 02:42.286
had crazy chemistry.

02:42.288 --> 02:45.155
The both like popcorn shrimp, The
Container Store, and Debbie Gibson.

02:45.157 --> 02:46.556
I mean, if you like one,

02:46.558 --> 02:48.091
chances are you're gonna
like the others.

02:48.093 --> 02:49.693
Ah, cool. I think that's great.

02:49.695 --> 02:51.861
You're getting out there,
playing the field casually.

02:51.863 --> 02:54.731
Casually?! Girl is
planning to lock it down!

02:54.733 --> 02:56.901
I mean, this is her moment.

02:56.903 --> 02:58.836
He broke up with his
fiancée eight months ago,

02:58.838 --> 03:01.873
has had two rebounds since,
and now is in the perfect zone

03:01.875 --> 03:03.841
to commit to a woman
named this bitch.

03:03.843 --> 03:05.243
I mean, my boss, Sydney.

03:05.245 --> 03:06.611
She's exaggerating.

03:06.613 --> 03:09.647
I didn't say that...
exactly like that.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.749
Two rebounds in eight months.
He sounds like a player.

03:11.751 --> 03:14.118
Is it such a big deal
these days to be a doctor?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.786
Pediatrician.
Oh, so he's not

03:15.788 --> 03:17.054
qualified to work
on adults then.

03:17.056 --> 03:18.355
He is pretty amazing.

03:18.357 --> 03:20.123
He's a triathlete,
he likes Court TV,

03:20.125 --> 03:21.658
and in his free time,
sommeliers.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.726
Not a verb.

03:22.728 --> 03:24.762
And best of all,
they're both workaholics,

03:24.764 --> 03:26.898
so all their sex
will be "miss you" sex.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.300
Gosh, I'm glad I asked you

03:28.302 --> 03:30.001
to move everything from
that pile to that pile.

03:30.003 --> 03:31.970
Look, Syd,
he sounds incredible.

03:31.972 --> 03:33.938
Just don't get your hopes up
too high.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.407
You know, no plan is foolproof.

03:35.409 --> 03:36.942
Oh, my God, I don't have a plan.

03:36.944 --> 03:39.377
So we go out on Friday,
maybe his kisses me, and then,

03:39.379 --> 03:41.145
you know, I hold out
for the goods till,

03:41.147 --> 03:42.647
like, date six;
let him know I'm a lady.

03:42.649 --> 03:44.348
And sure, you know,
we get engaged over Thanksgiving

03:44.350 --> 03:45.649
when his mother gives us
a blessing

03:45.651 --> 03:47.284
after a last-minute save
of her dry turkey.

03:47.286 --> 03:48.954
I wrap it in bacon.
But I mean, it's not like

03:48.972 --> 03:51.278
I have us marching down the
aisle to a string quartet

03:51.305 --> 03:53.318
playing a classically arranged
version of Debbie Gibson's

03:53.353 --> 03:56.761
1989 hit "Lost in Your Eyes."

03:56.763 --> 03:58.396
Because I'm not insane.

03:58.398 --> 03:59.864
Clearly not insane.

03:59.866 --> 04:02.700
Sydney, listen, I know you have
a lot going on,

04:02.702 --> 04:05.536
but I need you to take on
the Girlfriends print ads, too.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.171
Brad and Asian Brad
just called in sick.

04:07.173 --> 04:08.939
Oh, Lindsay and Dawn
just called in sick, too.

04:08.941 --> 04:11.575
You know, I offered free flu
shots last month. No one came.

04:11.577 --> 04:12.643
I blame Jenny McCarthy.

04:12.645 --> 04:14.745
I blame Zach.
That little girl

04:14.747 --> 04:16.713
coughed right in
your face yesterday.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.348
Did no one teach you how
to vampire cough into your arm?

04:19.350 --> 04:21.617
No. No, my mom always said
my germs were sweet.

04:21.619 --> 04:23.385
She lied. Go home.

04:23.387 --> 04:24.687
You can't leave.
We're already short-staffed.

04:24.689 --> 04:26.856
He's right. We need all hands
on deck for this apology tour.

04:26.858 --> 04:29.024
- And I hate being alone
when I'm sick. - Me, too.

04:29.026 --> 04:31.193
Dad, Kyle and I have been trying
to schedule this date forever.

04:31.195 --> 04:32.962
If somebody gets me sick
and I miss Friday,

04:32.964 --> 04:34.864
some other girl is just
gonna snatch him up.

04:34.866 --> 04:35.965
Don't you want grandkids?

04:35.967 --> 04:37.833
Yes, but I want Zach more.
That sounds wrong.

04:37.835 --> 04:40.536
I want grandkids,
but I want Zach more.

04:40.538 --> 04:41.704
You just said the same thing.

04:41.706 --> 04:43.705
Sounded different in my mind.

04:43.707 --> 04:45.340
Okay, fine. People
can stay and work.

04:45.342 --> 04:47.709
But anyone who's sick gets
separated from the gen pop.

04:47.711 --> 04:49.577
So into your cage,
outbreak monkey.

04:49.579 --> 04:50.545
You're gonna quarantine me?

04:50.547 --> 04:51.913
Come on, Sneezy.
Grumpy has spoken.

04:51.915 --> 04:53.248
I'm not sick;
it's like a baby's cough.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.217
Yeah, a baby who
smokes a pack a day.

04:55.219 --> 04:56.918
Guys, you're being
a little over the top.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.120
I'm not sick.
I feel fine.

04:58.122 --> 04:59.755
- I feel fine. - Uhhuh.
Lock it down.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.657
Whew!
Okay.

05:01.659 --> 05:03.056
Okay, that's not gonna keep me
in here.

05:03.082 --> 05:05.035
You know that right?

05:05.062 --> 05:07.663
It doesn't even...
This isn't natural, okay?

05:07.665 --> 05:10.800
God didn't make me
to be alone, guys.

05:14.608 --> 05:17.777
Simon, can I come in?
I promise I'm not sick.

05:17.779 --> 05:19.111
Oh, please, I've flatlined
three times, dear.

05:19.113 --> 05:21.479
The flu is like a flea fart
in a hurricane to me.

05:21.481 --> 05:22.679
Oh.

05:22.681 --> 05:24.480
What can I do you for?

05:24.482 --> 05:26.381
Well, as you know,
I'm a huge fan

05:26.383 --> 05:28.049
of the Girlfriends dolls.
I've collected them since

05:28.051 --> 05:30.451
I was a kid. And since the
office is so shorthanded,

05:30.453 --> 05:32.318
I'd like to help coordinate
the apology tour

05:32.320 --> 05:33.619
at the Girlfriends store.

05:34.688 --> 05:38.697
Well pardon-mo.
Sorry, Lauren. I'm back.

05:38.723 --> 05:40.022
Apology tour. Keep going.

05:40.024 --> 05:42.658
Well, we can invite the girl
from the YouTube video.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.860
What better way to apologize
to America than to first say

05:45.862 --> 05:47.662
I'm sorry
to her sad little face?

05:47.664 --> 05:48.997
- That is a fantastic idea.
- Oh.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.932
I wish I'd come up
with it myself.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.201
Actually, I did.
 I'm sure you'll

05:53.203 --> 05:54.335
vouch for me, won't you?

05:54.337 --> 05:56.470
Oh, uh, yes, of course I will.

05:56.472 --> 05:58.873
Ha! Loyalty test!
You just passed!

05:58.875 --> 06:01.208
- Oh, yay!
- You'll be working

06:01.210 --> 06:02.676
with Marsha
for in-store promotions.

06:02.678 --> 06:04.845
And if you need help,
Zach's in the conference room.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.147
Thank you so much, Simon.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.116
I promise I won't let you down.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.917
- It's your time to shine, baby.
- Thanks.

06:09.919 --> 06:13.354
Shh, it's our secret.

06:15.457 --> 06:17.291
What are you doing?
Aren't you banish-ed?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.894
Shh-shh. The headmistress
will hear you. I got hungry.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.563
Do you know how to cut the
corners off of grilled cheese?

06:22.565 --> 06:25.566
Yeah, I do. I'm not gonna
bite it into the shape

06:25.568 --> 06:27.368
- of a heart for you, though.
- That's hurtful.

06:27.370 --> 06:28.969
Sorry. So what
do you think

06:28.971 --> 06:31.104
about the whole Sydney "I'm gonna
lock down Kyle" situation?

06:31.106 --> 06:32.873
- That's weird, right?
- No, girl needs a win.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.808
Her last date took her
to Chili's, bowling,

06:34.810 --> 06:36.644
then to the symphony
with special guest Yo-Yo Ma.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.579
That was me. We had
a friend night out.

06:38.581 --> 06:40.180
So the story's even sadder
than I thought.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.081
We were in the presence
of a master cellist.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.417
The point is, she's
moving so fast,

06:44.419 --> 06:47.086
it's like she's planning out
her whole life with this guy.

06:47.088 --> 06:50.022
It's-It's uncomfortable
to watch, right?

06:50.024 --> 06:52.157
Ah, so it's like that, huh?
Well, what do you care?

06:52.159 --> 06:53.492
Aren't you back on with Nancy?

06:53.494 --> 06:56.595
Oh, she gave me a chore wheel.
A man draws a line somewhere.

06:56.597 --> 06:58.264
Whew. Glad you made it out.

06:58.266 --> 06:59.332
Thanks. Glad to be here.

06:59.334 --> 07:00.900
But what about
this whole Sydney thing?

07:00.902 --> 07:02.634
I mean, it's weird, right?

07:02.636 --> 07:04.803
Well, clearly, you know,
you two have a thing

07:04.805 --> 07:07.438
with the tragic friend dates
and all the looks.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.706
What, she looks at me?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.141
Yeah. The only problem
is you two

07:10.143 --> 07:11.876
never look at each other
at the same time.

07:11.878 --> 07:14.612
What, I should try to make that happen?
I'm not really sure

07:14.614 --> 07:17.415
it matters, but once she goes
on that date with Dr. Kyle,

07:17.417 --> 07:18.883
it's anyone's game.
Well, really, it's his game.

07:18.885 --> 07:20.351
He'll be the winner
of that game.

07:20.353 --> 07:21.986
Will you feel my forehead?

07:21.988 --> 07:23.588
No. So what would I do?

07:23.590 --> 07:25.823
I can't upend the date.
That would be sophomoric.

07:25.825 --> 07:27.926
And it's unnecessary.
He's not perfect, right?

07:27.928 --> 07:30.428
Well, let's see.
He's a six-foot-two triathlete

07:30.430 --> 07:31.930
who occasionally sommeliers.

07:31.932 --> 07:33.531
It's not a verb.
It's a profession.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.266
You don't say,
"Hey, Mr. President,

07:35.268 --> 07:36.367
have fun presidenting today."

07:36.369 --> 07:37.768
You know, for a guy

07:37.770 --> 07:41.105
who knows his verbs,
I don't see you doing anything.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.712
Whew! "Murder-suicide
rate among doctors"

07:47.714 --> 07:50.049
"on the rise with no
ceiling in sight.

07:50.051 --> 07:52.085
Half their victims are
their spouses"? Yeesh!

07:52.087 --> 07:54.321
Hey, Syd, you want
to borrow this?

07:54.323 --> 07:55.789
Mm. I'm no longer
accepting paper.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.024
All communication is to be
done in electronic form.

07:58.026 --> 07:59.626
Ms. Roberts,
can you sign this?

07:59.628 --> 08:01.561
Oh! Forge it!

08:02.396 --> 08:03.529
Hmm...

08:11.338 --> 08:14.073
Kyle just sent me a selfie.
What do I do?

08:14.075 --> 08:15.608
Ooh, send him one back,

08:15.610 --> 08:18.210
but no face if you're
gonna do a boob shot.

08:18.212 --> 08:21.080
Thank you for watching my back.
And my front.

08:21.082 --> 08:23.016
Does Kyle have
a fetish for SARS?

08:23.018 --> 08:25.318
Oh.

08:29.925 --> 08:32.558
Damn it, Andrew! Every one?

08:36.965 --> 08:38.399
Okay.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.306
This bitch
is gonna lock it down!

08:44.308 --> 08:45.774
Footsteps, footsteps.
Shh!

08:45.776 --> 08:47.976
Simon, I have a preliminary
itinerary for the event...

08:47.978 --> 08:49.310
What's going on?

08:49.312 --> 08:53.646
I've been hiding Osama bin
Hacking from the Sydney drone.

08:53.648 --> 08:55.046
- Shh.
- I needed him, okay?

08:55.048 --> 08:57.615
Listen, we came up with an
idea for an online contest

08:57.617 --> 08:59.783
where girls across America
record their best...

08:59.785 --> 09:01.251
Do the voice, do the voice.

09:01.253 --> 09:03.286
- Okay, okay. I'm "sowwy."
- And the best, "I'm sowwy" gets

09:03.288 --> 09:07.122
to be the voice of a limited-
edition Randi Jenkins doll.

09:07.124 --> 09:09.757
And to test it out, we hacked
into Randi's voice box.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.425
Oh, there he is!
There he is!

09:11.427 --> 09:13.527
When Andrew hears
the lines we recorded,

09:13.529 --> 09:14.594
he's gonna be terrified.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.462
Now wait for it.
Wait for it.

09:16.464 --> 09:19.330
I like your blue-striped
pajamas, Andrew.

09:19.332 --> 09:22.132
It creeped him out.

09:22.134 --> 09:23.999
He's creeped out, he's creeped out.

09:24.001 --> 09:26.568
Oh, Zach, you are sick.
Do not come near me.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.569
So you're treating me
like a leper, too, now?

09:28.571 --> 09:31.605
What about the sexy times
we had, huh? We swapped more

09:31.607 --> 09:33.040
than oxygen, young lady.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.074
She's right.
If Syd sees you, she'll flip.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.809
Get back to work in District 9.

09:36.811 --> 09:38.276
As for you, Marsha's sick.
You're gonna be

09:38.278 --> 09:40.210
in charge of the whole event.
Are you up for this, lady?

09:40.212 --> 09:41.678
- Yes.
- Okay, first of all,

09:41.680 --> 09:43.312
you have to coordinate
the guest list.

09:43.314 --> 09:45.313
Get all the press passes
in order and make sure that

09:45.315 --> 09:47.481
all three of these dolls make it
back to the store for the event.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.416
And no stopping for ice cweam
or twamp stamps, okay?

09:49.418 --> 09:50.783
- I won't.
- Okay.

09:50.785 --> 09:52.050
Good luck.

09:54.187 --> 09:55.687
Hey, Lauren, this is
a big deal, yeah.

09:55.689 --> 09:57.055
Yeah, do you want
me to help you?

09:57.057 --> 09:58.222
I can pitch while you flush

09:58.224 --> 09:59.657
my nasal passages
with my Neti Pot.

09:59.659 --> 10:00.825
I can handle this on my own.

10:00.827 --> 10:03.093
Okay, fine. Maybe just
the Neti Pot then,

10:03.095 --> 10:05.128
but there's gonna be some pretty
unpleasant stuff that comes

10:05.130 --> 10:06.862
out of me, so when I say so...

10:06.864 --> 10:09.096
...you have to look away,
because I don't want to spoil

10:09.098 --> 10:11.365
what I imagine is a pretty
perfect image of me.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.767
Zach, I'm not touching you,
okay? Go away!

10:13.769 --> 10:16.370
- I can't afford to get...
-  Uhoh.

10:16.372 --> 10:18.338
I'm not sick.
This is my moment.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.173
Now get back in there
with your kind.

10:20.175 --> 10:23.777
No one is immune to this.
It's coming for you.

10:23.779 --> 10:26.714
It's coming for you.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.027 --> 10:37.561
Mm. Okay.

10:37.563 --> 10:38.895
So the kickoff
is this afternoon,

10:38.897 --> 10:39.896
and then the radio spots

10:39.898 --> 10:41.664
are gonna roll out
this weekend,

10:41.666 --> 10:43.533
And then Monday

10:43.535 --> 10:45.468
we launch the Forgive
and Forget campaign.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.637
Right.
Which is where?

10:47.639 --> 10:49.706
What is that?

10:50.508 --> 10:52.142
Glass of water,
three-e-urths full.

10:52.144 --> 10:54.444
Okay, but why did
you put it there?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.346
I didn't touch it.
I didn't... uh, Zach, tell her.

10:56.348 --> 10:57.580
I don't know what
she's accusing me of.

10:57.582 --> 10:58.882
Guys, I...

10:58.884 --> 11:00.750
What are you talking about?
Somebody just come in here

11:00.752 --> 11:02.219
- and rub my head, please.
- I'll do it.

11:02.221 --> 11:03.520
No, Fern, leave me alone,
back to work.

11:03.522 --> 11:04.488
Are you trying to get me sick?

11:04.490 --> 11:05.556
What?

11:05.558 --> 11:06.957
No. Why would I want to do that?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.793
Because you don't want me
to go out with Kyle.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.760
Aw, come on.

11:10.762 --> 11:11.895
- That's ridic.
- That is why

11:11.897 --> 11:13.196
you've been acting
so weird all week.

11:13.198 --> 11:14.697
Handing me articles on suicide,

11:14.699 --> 11:15.932
photobombing all
of my pictures...

11:15.934 --> 11:17.367
I was filling in
the blank space.

11:17.369 --> 11:19.169
- I know how to stage a selfie.
- Ah...

11:19.171 --> 11:20.237
I thought we were past this.

11:20.239 --> 11:21.338
We are.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.540
Look, you're just
moving so fast

11:22.542 --> 11:24.041
with this guy that you
barely even know...

11:24.043 --> 11:25.109
I know a lot about him.

11:25.111 --> 11:26.344
I mean, he gardens,

11:26.346 --> 11:27.912
- he cooks... - Oh, yeah,
and he triathletes,

11:27.914 --> 11:29.146
he pediatrishes, we get it.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.915
- Are you jealous?
- What?

11:30.917 --> 11:32.282
No... I'm not jealous.

11:32.284 --> 11:33.851
But you can't deny the fact

11:33.853 --> 11:35.919
that no matter how many times
we say "we're just friends,"

11:35.921 --> 11:36.887
there's something else

11:36.889 --> 11:37.854
between us, and I'm not

11:37.856 --> 11:38.955
the only one who thinks that.

11:38.957 --> 11:40.424
Oh, please, let's not
talk about this.

11:40.426 --> 11:41.558
Well, tell me I'm wrong.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.660
Just say it, because

11:42.662 --> 11:44.228
my affections and
wishes are unchanged,

11:44.230 --> 11:45.229
but one word from you

11:45.231 --> 11:46.597
will silence me
on this subject forever.

11:46.599 --> 11:49.166
That's from
Pride and Prejudice.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.202
So?

11:51.204 --> 11:52.937
Jane Austen doesn't own words.

11:52.939 --> 11:54.306
Go ahead. Tell me.

11:55.242 --> 11:56.642
Okay, yes, but please,

11:56.644 --> 11:58.277
could we just not
do this, not now?

11:58.279 --> 12:00.546
Not now, but maybe you'd
go for it in the future?

12:00.548 --> 12:01.647
Say, when you've run out

12:01.649 --> 12:03.149
of better choices?
I didn't say that.

12:03.151 --> 12:04.517
No, I get it. I'm your backup guy.
You're putting words

12:04.519 --> 12:06.019
in my mouth. Mean words. That's great.
Well, guess what.

12:06.021 --> 12:07.020
It's over.

12:07.022 --> 12:08.421
I'm ending our
future relationship.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.623
- You can't do that.
- I just did it.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.724
But we don't even
have a relationship.

12:10.726 --> 12:12.192
Yeah, because it's
in the future.

12:12.194 --> 12:13.627
A future which now
no longer exists.

12:13.629 --> 12:14.995
Okay, fine.
You want to know

12:14.997 --> 12:17.964
what I think about
when I think about us?

12:17.966 --> 12:20.000
I think about what happens
if it doesn't work out.

12:20.002 --> 12:21.601
Then what?

12:21.603 --> 12:23.102
I mean, we just go back
to being friends?

12:23.104 --> 12:24.870
You know, and then
suddenly you stop

12:24.872 --> 12:26.171
making fun of me
for the beach blazer,

12:26.173 --> 12:28.373
and I stop telling you
that peeling an orange

12:28.375 --> 12:30.642
in one piece is not
a superpower, it's OCD?

12:30.644 --> 12:32.811
Because now, all of a
sudden, everything is laden

12:32.813 --> 12:34.246
with stuff.

12:34.248 --> 12:35.914
And then we-we
stop hanging out

12:35.916 --> 12:37.082
and the next thing that I know,

12:37.084 --> 12:38.884
I've lost my best friend.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.022
Why are you asking me
to take that chance?

12:43.024 --> 12:45.457
You're right.

12:45.459 --> 12:47.392
I'm sorry. Shh. That's my phone.

12:47.394 --> 12:48.760
Where is it?
It's Kyle calling.

12:48.762 --> 12:50.395
Wait, is that Debbie Gibson's

12:50.397 --> 12:52.697
- "Lost in Your Eyes"? You didn't...
- No judging, just looking, okay?

12:52.699 --> 12:54.332
He could be calling
to reschedule.

12:55.669 --> 12:57.369
I thought it was mine.

12:57.371 --> 12:58.737
I'm sowwy.

12:58.739 --> 13:01.139
I-I can't go in there.

13:01.141 --> 13:03.542
No.

13:03.544 --> 13:05.577
But I can.

13:26.565 --> 13:29.033
I see the sexual
harassment seminar

13:29.035 --> 13:31.270
was more of a how-to
workshop for you, Fern.

13:32.606 --> 13:34.540
Hello, friend.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.275
It's easier if you don't fight.

13:36.277 --> 13:38.577
The illness, that is,

13:38.579 --> 13:40.646
not Fern.

13:40.648 --> 13:43.583
Always fight Fern.

14:03.536 --> 14:05.504
You sacrificed
your health for me.

14:05.506 --> 14:07.806
That's what friends are for.

14:07.808 --> 14:09.842
Thank you, Andrew.

14:10.844 --> 14:12.284
Now put the phone
down and step away.

14:15.848 --> 14:18.083
As Mr. Bennett told his
daughter in P and P,

14:18.085 --> 14:19.952
I have been a selfish being

14:19.954 --> 14:22.288
all my life in practice,

14:22.290 --> 14:24.557
though not in principle.

14:43.244 --> 14:46.513
It is a beautiful
day for an apology tour,

14:46.515 --> 14:48.081
and although we all wish

14:48.083 --> 14:50.150
this unfortunate
incident didn't happen,

14:50.152 --> 14:51.918
I'd be lying if I said.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.221
Randi didn't love
all this attention.

14:54.223 --> 14:57.023
You talk about her
like she's a real person.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.925
I'm sorry?

14:58.927 --> 15:00.727
Look how happy that little
girl from YouTube is.

15:00.729 --> 15:02.896
Looks like she finally
got a handle on

15:02.898 --> 15:04.563
- her PTSD.
- It's all you.

15:04.565 --> 15:06.165
And a My Little Pony Prozac.

15:09.571 --> 15:10.638
Zach, my man.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.707
I'm here with Lauren,
the woman of the hour.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.910
Hey, listen, Simon, where's
the mean Randi Jenkins doll?

15:14.911 --> 15:17.111
This one just says,
"I'm beautiful,"

15:17.113 --> 15:18.512
and that's not gonna
scare Andrew.

15:18.514 --> 15:21.114
Lauren, which dolls
did you send back?

15:21.116 --> 15:23.816
Um, three of them,
like you asked.

15:23.818 --> 15:25.018
Uh-huh.

15:33.494 --> 15:34.995
- Oh, no.
- No.

15:34.997 --> 15:36.130
And now,

15:36.132 --> 15:38.333
I give you the new, improved.

15:38.335 --> 15:40.902
Sweet Randi Jenkins.

15:40.904 --> 15:43.038
You're beautiful on the inside.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.106
Not that one.

15:45.108 --> 15:47.842
I'm so glad we're friend again.

15:47.844 --> 15:49.510
Oh, no, not that poor,
unstable girl.

15:49.512 --> 15:51.278
Excuse me, excuse me, coming through.
Hey, everybody!

15:51.280 --> 15:52.245
How we doing here today?

15:52.247 --> 15:53.380
How we doing? Hello, kids.

15:53.382 --> 15:55.315
You having a good time today?
Hey!

15:55.317 --> 15:56.549
Give yourself
a round of applause.

15:56.551 --> 15:57.650
And give this man a round

15:57.652 --> 15:58.985
of applause for having
the courage to wear

15:58.987 --> 16:00.954
that mustard vest, huh?
How about that?

16:00.956 --> 16:03.156
- Okay.
- What's going on?

16:03.158 --> 16:04.325
I have no idea.

16:04.327 --> 16:05.626
I would hardly call that
mustard.

16:05.628 --> 16:07.261
- Sweetheart, can I
borrow your doll? - No.

16:07.263 --> 16:09.129
Well, how about if
I give you a quarter?

16:09.131 --> 16:10.398
I-I have a quarter
here somewhere.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.299
This is literally the poster
for "stranger danger."

16:12.301 --> 16:13.467
I told you.
She's mine,

16:13.469 --> 16:14.802
and I want to hear
what she says.

16:14.804 --> 16:15.769
Oh, no, you don't,
you really don't.

16:15.771 --> 16:16.670
You'd look better

16:16.672 --> 16:18.671
with no eyes.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.206
- Now it's my turn...
- You know what "déjà vu" means?

16:20.208 --> 16:22.208
...to cut your hair. Please, can
I just borrow the doll from you?

16:22.210 --> 16:24.043
You can't see my teeth,
but you'll feel them.

16:24.045 --> 16:25.745
Nobody loves you.
Now, you see?

16:25.747 --> 16:27.514
You're gonna love me when you're dead.
She's really not friendly.

16:27.516 --> 16:28.515
Can I borrow her

16:28.517 --> 16:30.117
I want to stick
pencils in your ears.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.219
There's got to be
a button somewhere.

16:32.221 --> 16:33.621
I'll save your dog for last.

16:33.623 --> 16:34.822
Ooh, stop hearing.

16:34.824 --> 16:36.257
You can't scream
without a tongue.

16:36.259 --> 16:37.324
- What's your blood type?
- Stop, stop, stop!

16:37.326 --> 16:38.892
Mine's hungry.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.494
Your insides will be fun to eat.
Don't make me do this.

I... I'm actually
very good at it.

17:56.419 --> 17:57.452
See?

17:57.454 --> 17:59.321
No, I...
I'm not sick.

17:59.323 --> 18:01.223
I-I'm sorry, I really...
I can't take a chance.

18:01.225 --> 18:03.625
You know, for the sake of the children.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.427
But we'll reschedule.

18:07.529 --> 18:08.729
I have a mask.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.601
Have we met?

18:17.613 --> 18:19.149
Hey.

18:19.151 --> 18:20.183
Need any help?

18:20.185 --> 18:21.384
Oh.

18:21.386 --> 18:22.385
Yeah, I guess.

18:22.387 --> 18:24.221
- Here you go.
- Simon,

18:24.223 --> 18:25.723
I just want you to know

18:25.725 --> 18:27.357
what an honor it has been
to work for you.

18:27.359 --> 18:28.960
In the future, every time

18:28.962 --> 18:30.628
I make a half-caf
breve latte

18:30.630 --> 18:32.263
with an ironic foam
design of my choosing,

18:32.265 --> 18:33.298
I'll think of you.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.300
That is so sweet.
But where are you going?

18:35.302 --> 18:37.135
You're firing me.

18:37.137 --> 18:38.269
That's why we're
packing my stuff.

18:38.271 --> 18:39.938
Oh, I thought
you were stealing.

18:39.940 --> 18:40.939
I can't fire you.

18:40.941 --> 18:42.107
I need you to help with

18:42.109 --> 18:43.542
the apology tour
for the apology tour.

18:43.544 --> 18:44.810
Girlfriends didn't let us go?

18:44.812 --> 18:46.478
Oh, no. Turns out Garrett
believes everything

18:46.480 --> 18:47.580
that Randi Jenkins says.

18:47.582 --> 18:49.315
Lewis, Roberts & Roberts

18:49.317 --> 18:51.717
is the premier agency
in this town.

18:51.719 --> 18:53.719
If they go, I go.

18:53.721 --> 18:54.786
We got 'em.

18:54.788 --> 18:56.054
But I blew my one big moment.

18:56.056 --> 18:56.989
Oh, no, no.

18:56.991 --> 18:58.624
Your big moment was a year ago,

18:58.626 --> 19:00.026
sitting across
from me in my office

19:00.028 --> 19:01.627
and handing me
a four-page résumé.

19:01.629 --> 19:03.029
Can type 80 words a minute...

19:03.031 --> 19:04.363
Can field-dress
a moose...

19:04.365 --> 19:07.367
Can forge any signature
after only seeing it once?

19:07.369 --> 19:08.835
Well, this I gotta see.

19:08.837 --> 19:10.837
Right.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.740
When I hired you, I knew
there'd be a lot of moments

19:13.742 --> 19:15.709
and I can't wait
to see what's next.

19:15.711 --> 19:17.577
Yeah.

19:17.579 --> 19:18.579
Come on.

19:18.581 --> 19:20.882
Let's unpack.

19:24.478 --> 19:25.979
Sorry about your date.

19:25.981 --> 19:27.147
Oh, that's okay.

19:27.149 --> 19:30.116
I'm not sure I even believe
that stuff anyway.

19:30.118 --> 19:32.285
Fate, timing...

19:32.287 --> 19:33.453
Life is just random chaos,

19:33.455 --> 19:34.420
and then you die.

19:34.422 --> 19:35.588
Hey, hey.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.223
Come on, save it for
your children's book.

19:38.493 --> 19:39.892
I just don't get it.

19:39.894 --> 19:41.127
I mean, I took every precaution

19:41.129 --> 19:42.262
not to get sick.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.832
I must've OD'd
on Oscsclococcinum.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.234
How did this happen?

19:58.215 --> 20:00.416
Shh...

20:00.418 --> 20:02.818
I guess fate just
had its own plan.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.223
Is anyone gonna make soup?

20:10.027 --> 20:11.160
Chicken & Stars,

20:11.162 --> 20:13.495
and you could
throw in some crackers.

20:13.497 --> 20:15.097
Don't freeze me out.

20:15.099 --> 20:16.332
Say something, please.

20:16.334 --> 20:18.100
Shh.

20:20.304 --> 20:21.412
I'm sowwy.

You okay?

20:24.042 --> 20:25.007
Yeah.

20:25.009 --> 20:26.609
Okay, fine!
Fine.

20:26.611 --> 20:27.643
People can work,

20:27.645 --> 20:28.945
and they can stay...

20:28.947 --> 20:31.147
not you.

20:32.082 --> 20:33.149
You know, um...

20:34.519 --> 20:36.352
I'm sowwy.

20:36.354 --> 20:37.420
Did you hear me, guys?

20:37.422 --> 20:39.122
Shh.
Quiet.

20:39.124 --> 20:40.990
Get me popcorn, Andrew.

20:40.992 --> 20:41.991
I'll kill you

20:41.993 --> 20:43.860
- in your sleep.
- It's the doll.

20:45.530 --> 20:46.930
Play right now.
Flashback funny.

20:46.932 --> 20:48.232
Meanwhile, across town,

20:48.234 --> 20:49.533
Bill D'Elia sits at a monitor.

20:49.535 --> 20:50.935
Flashback funny.

20:50.937 --> 20:53.071
You hate me, don't you?

20:53.073 --> 20:54.306
I know who you are.

20:54.308 --> 20:55.774
Oh...

20:55.776 --> 20:58.044
Game over, boys and girls.

20:58.046 --> 20:59.678
Bring in the stunt doll.
