00:02.000 --> 00:07.559
This programme contains scenes of
sexual violence

00:07.560 --> 00:13.159
and scenes which some viewers may
find disturbing.

00:13.160 --> 00:17.479
Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to Whitechapel.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.760
Be sure to look down as keenly
as you look up.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.680
Mr Gladstone himself, only last week,
found himself fitted for new boots.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.600
Follow me for the
haunts of Jack The Ripper.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.640
Who wants a wager?

00:51.280 --> 00:53.440
Yours, shitspade.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.159
Our men in blue are still
cloaked in ignorance of Jack.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.479
Here you are, darling, looking for
a bit of company?

01:05.480 --> 01:10.879
Miller's Court. Five months past,
the scene of the worst.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.919
The worst and, please, God, the last.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.800
Mary Jane Kelly.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
What that man, Jack, did to her.
Well, we shall not say.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.399
He's tasty, all right. Where'd you
find him? I looked. Wasn't hard.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.679
Fighters, whores, flesh
is what you seek,

01:29.680 --> 01:31.360
there's no shortage in these parts.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.239
Falls when he's bid?

01:37.240 --> 01:39.799
Money's right, he'll give you his
mother and his sister, too.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.960
I likes him.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.239
All of this parish know little
else but thuggery.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.159
How best to raise them
up from such iniquity?

01:49.160 --> 01:51.959
Well, that's a matter for you
good people, of course.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.320
Look! Look!

01:55.840 --> 01:58.519
Black shit and buggery.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.679
Murder! Murder!

02:01.680 --> 02:04.480
Murder!

02:12.920 --> 02:14.919
The inspector... I must see him...

02:14.920 --> 02:18.280
Show yourself in there dressed
like that, they'll know he's blue.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.480
You're champion this night!

02:42.760 --> 02:44.439
You little streak of piss!

02:44.440 --> 02:46.800
I've gutted younger for less,
do you hear? Let me.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.039
This better be very good.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.880
They've found a tart, sir.
Up on Folgate.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.280
She's been ripped, Inspector.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.839
Hobbs, you did right.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.999
Cecil Smeaton's greed will keep him
warm for a day or two.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.799
You will take a fall for him
tomorrow. Yes, sir.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.959
This girl, if she has been carved
as has been described,

03:52.960 --> 03:55.319
Ripper or no, word will have spread.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.439
We will find the press, a mob,
whipped into a fear and rage.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.959
This populace, still without a culprit,

04:01.960 --> 04:04.679
it is to our uniform that
they direct their fury.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.879
So you stand strong and
follow your sergeant.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
They'll do their duty, sir.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.799
You. Name? Creighton.
Creighton, have you touched anything?

04:47.800 --> 04:51.159
Have you arranged matters to
your benefit in any way? No, sir.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.159
Who is it has paid for your time here?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.759
Mr Best at The Star, Inspector,
who else?

04:55.760 --> 04:58.639
Well, you're on my ticket now. I want
these details, I want her face,

04:58.640 --> 05:00.960
her eyes, her throat.
She wasn't cut here.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.959
Where was she... where was
she brought in from?

05:04.960 --> 05:06.920
We can't keep 'em penned
in much longer, sir.

05:06.921 --> 05:09.639
But this is vital. All of it.
And this is next to useless.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.960
I need this place uncorrupted
and in daylight. What?

05:11.961 --> 05:14.039
The wall.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.200
He's left word again.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.440
"Down on whores."

05:19.720 --> 05:22.439
I need more time with her. Sir,
there's the way things are,

05:22.440 --> 05:25.920
and the way things should be,
but that lot are coming through.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.879
Right, we need to move her.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.840
You. You're not finished.
I want the ground

05:31.841 --> 05:34.679
going in both directions away from
her. As much as you can get.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.280
I want the wall, the writing.
You understand?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.879
Stand aside.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.960
Stand aside! Stand aside!

06:06.040 --> 06:09.719
A comment for The Star, Inspector?
Is it him?

06:09.720 --> 06:11.199
Is it Jack?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.559
Away with you, Best.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.960
These citizens need their questions
answered, Mr Reid.

06:14.961 --> 06:17.040
No. They need their fears pacified.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.399
Where would be the sport in that?

06:20.400 --> 06:24.199
Where are we taking her, sir?
The London? Mr Bagster-Philipps'?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.440
No. You take her back to
Leman Street. Use the back.

06:26.441 --> 06:30.159
Find a cell, lock her in it.
Don't book her in, tell no-one.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.800
Yourself, sir? Not the American.
Just get her hid.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.039
Let's go!

06:37.040 --> 06:38.800
Come on.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.040
(SHE GASPS AND GIGGLES)

07:05.240 --> 07:08.559
Captain Jackson, this is
all topsy-turvy, I'm sure.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.479
Now, Rose. I have told you,

07:12.480 --> 07:14.680
there are no rules here.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.160
(CRASHING AND SHOUTING)

07:33.960 --> 07:35.879
Jackson!

07:35.880 --> 07:37.599
Sweet Jesus.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.359
You cannot simply intrude here
any time of your choosing.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.720
That this house thrives
and your girls are not walking

07:42.721 --> 07:45.559
the streets this night is at my
whim and indulgence, Madam.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.199
Don't forget that. Where is he?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.799
What do I care? It's not
as if he ever pays.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.040
First door on the left.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.719
Jackson!

07:52.720 --> 07:53.919
Jackson!

07:53.920 --> 07:58.000
What!? He's taken me for the night!
Jackson!

07:59.800 --> 08:02.799
Reid?

08:02.800 --> 08:06.119
I'm occupied. I'll come see
you in the morning.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.880
Can't wait. I need a surgeon.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.320
You have your own. They're drunks
and incompetents. I want you.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.440
Five minutes. Now! Now!

08:22.400 --> 08:24.960
Now.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.000
You going to tell me what this is
about? Just keep walking.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.880
WOMAN: Don't touch me,
don't touch me! >

08:58.040 --> 08:59.640
Jackson!

09:18.480 --> 09:19.719
Is it him?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.319
That's what you're here to find out.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.240
Your sudden passion for the furtive?

09:24.241 --> 09:26.360
I must be sure before
that hell rises again.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.240
Get her naked, Sergeant Drake.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.720
Gently.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.080
Are those hands or meat hooks, really?

09:51.160 --> 09:53.400
It's no wonder to me
at all you're a bachelor.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.599
The haemorrhage is from the
severance of the left carotid.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.399
Was the stroke left or right?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.919
Like the others.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.279
And these are... these are stars,
aren't they?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.760
And the eyelids slit apart.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.079
Catherine Eddowes and
Mary Jane Kelly had the same.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.959
And the writing on the wall?

10:16.960 --> 10:20.079
Like Goulston Street the night
we found Miss Eddowes' apron.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.040
The same words as was in that letter.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.559
What... what is that?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.319
Some kind of gelatine.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.959
What kind?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.559
From a meat pie. What?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.040
How am I to know yet?

10:36.120 --> 10:37.880
Don't you have evidence to collect?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.600
I know it's tempting,
but try not to kill him.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.439
Mr Reid, sir.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.079
I'm hearing strange rumours.
Oh, yes?

10:54.080 --> 10:57.719
That there's an unregistered
female on the premises.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.719
Always an abundance of those, Sergeant.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.319
I'm not here to judge you, sir.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.919
Just to remind you of our
obligations under the law.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.600
Why, thank you for that,
Artherton. As always.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.080
Creighton! Open up!

11:45.280 --> 11:46.480
This one.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.640
He dragged the body
through the archway.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.080
Those?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.999
Oh, I over-exposed them.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.400
Worth our while to check.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.999
Do you think me some bone-headed
flatfoot? They need more time.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.160
Professional man like yourself, I
would have thought you'd know better.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.839
That's the same wall!

12:52.840 --> 12:54.439
Where's the message, Creighton?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.679
The writing on the wall,
"Down on whores."

12:56.680 --> 12:58.400
Was it you painted it up there?

12:59.520 --> 13:00.920
You know who it was.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.359
Best.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.960
I just record what I see.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.080
Get that to press, quick sharp.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.279
How do you think they felt,
those girls,

13:28.280 --> 13:31.119
the moment they knew that was it,
that breathing this air was up?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.599
Hmm? The later ones.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.479
They would have known what that
lunatic intended for their bodies.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.239
Do you have a pity for them?

13:37.240 --> 13:40.599
Do you have a pity for the many men
you've ruined with your accusations?

13:40.600 --> 13:43.919
I have... I have never accused.
I have asked questions.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.080
I have speculated!

13:45.081 --> 13:47.960
Speculate! Well, I speculate
about you, Best.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.119
The hand that penned that letter.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.519
A letter I never credited as bona fide.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.439
And now,

13:56.440 --> 13:57.880
this.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.560
What else did you alter?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.239
Nothing. Yeah, well,
I didn't have to, did I?

14:08.240 --> 14:11.239
Just underlined what's plain
to a man who's as intimate with

14:11.240 --> 14:13.040
the Ripper's doings as myself.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.920
Well, myself and
Chief Inspector Abberline.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.559
You spoke to Fred Abberline?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.960
Your boss, as was. I have. Yes.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.440
And he finds himself
in agreement with me.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.999
Our friend is back.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.039
Nothing's for certain. I won't have
people hiding in their homes again,

14:36.040 --> 14:38.199
till I get to certain.
If I see this in print

14:38.200 --> 14:40.479
I'll be back here for some
ripping of my own.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.520
Oo-ooh!

14:46.320 --> 14:48.879
Who do you think you are, Reid?

14:48.880 --> 14:53.079
What, you come here to rattle me
when you forget what I know of you?

14:53.080 --> 14:56.479
Oh, no. Do not fear, good citizens,
do not shake.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.799
For sleepless, tireless
Detectives Reid and Abberline,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.879
hunt our Jack down
dockside and rookery.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.959
Two finer police the world
has not yet made,

15:03.960 --> 15:08.799
so be of good heart, this maniac
will be brought to ground and hard.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.280
Only, erm...

15:11.920 --> 15:15.920
Oh, yeah, no, he... he wasn't,
was he?

15:17.640 --> 15:20.600
The man and his works abide.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.000
Friday. All right?

15:27.800 --> 15:31.720
Unless you've got something proves
it's another knifeman...

15:32.960 --> 15:34.800
this story turns over on Friday.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.119
Ah, Inspector.
I know, I know, Artherton.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.359
It's not that, sir. What?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.640
Our past has come to say how-do.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.679
Chief Inspector Abberline.
What merits such a visit?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.559
Enough dancing, Detective.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.680
If there's a diced up girl
in this shop, she's mine.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.040
Out.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.159
How could you do this?
This is my shop now.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.519
This is my case!
I know what this looks like.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.719
Look... look, this graffito.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.759
This is Best's contrivance.
Look at her!

16:42.760 --> 16:46.679
Her eyes, the stars on
her face, her guts.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.639
Her abdomen was opened fresh,
right here, as part of the autopsy

16:49.640 --> 16:51.040
conducted by Homer Jackson.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.999
That Yankee clap-doctor!

16:53.000 --> 16:56.519
The man was a US Army surgeon
and he was a Pinkerton. Pinkerton?

16:56.520 --> 16:59.759
That's right.
A chartered mercenary with a badge!

16:59.760 --> 17:01.919
And you place his word above mine.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.799
I think you would have her
Ripper above all else.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.678
Another bite, another chance at him.

17:06.679 --> 17:07.800
But you would not?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.959
I would have my innards
served to me cold

17:09.960 --> 17:12.440
if I thought it would show him to us
but, Fred, what if...

17:12.441 --> 17:16.279
what if this girl was dressed
as Jack for our eyes?

17:16.280 --> 17:19.398
And in our fervour, we fill the
streets with uniform hunting for him

17:19.400 --> 17:21.999
and miss the truth of it?
Now let me bring my mercenary

17:22.000 --> 17:23.520
back in here and have him speak.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.319
The fact he didn't open her up
strikes as strange.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.559
Their guts, it's what he always
wanted the most.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.759
To open them up and see the viscera
in his hand.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.119
Then he was caught short,
as he was with Elizabeth Stride.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.839
Her throat was cut,
the rest of her untouched.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.079
But if he was disturbed with
this one, he went back to her.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.439
Or he hid beside her.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.639
But whichever, he waited some few
hours before bringing her here.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.039
So long, in fact, that all the blood
had ceased to spill from her body.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.919
You see these cuts and
gashes in her throat?

17:57.920 --> 18:00.559
No blood on the road
she was dragged across.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.159
I doubt there'd have been much
where they opened her, either.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.800
When the woman's throat was cut?
The throat is a post-mortem injury.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.120
Then what did for her?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.320
Asphyxia.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.080
Her hyoid bone is broken.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.440
So she was strangled.
And all else happened after.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.439
These slits in her eyes and her face,

18:26.440 --> 18:29.279
with Kelly and Eddowes, they were
a postscript, an afterthought.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.919
This girl, they're top billing.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.280
This is theory. Not proof.

18:35.360 --> 18:41.400
Get proof. If you cannot,
I'll pull rank and claim her.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.119
What else?

18:49.120 --> 18:52.359
Well, despite your friend
Best's connivery,

18:52.360 --> 18:56.559
she had been serviced,
recently and vigorously.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.199
So she <i>was</i> a tart?
No, I don't think so.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.199
See, I place her no younger than 28.

19:02.200 --> 19:07.199
Her skin, nail beds, the essential
health of her... apparatus.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.959
By that age even the more
costly are worn through.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.400
So, if she wasn't a professional?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.440
My guess...

19:15.480 --> 19:17.520
The lady taught fiddle.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.959
Yeah, she lived to the north.
The new suburbs.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.559
Has the Pinkerton been
conferring with spirits?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.800
Enough, Sergeant. Go on.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.239
Here, beneath her chin.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.160
You see this moon-like impression
in the clavicle? Her fingers...

19:38.520 --> 19:40.879
worn and puckered by strings.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.479
And her hair, there are heavy
deposits in it.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.480
Soot.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.320
From the underground railway.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.560
Which arrives, Drake, I believe,
from which direction?

19:57.240 --> 19:59.759
Finchley, Highgate, Crouch End.
Missing persons reports.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.479
Can't be too many lady violinists.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.639
Just a warning, sir.
It may take some time.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.919
The Type Printing Telegraphs
you ordered...

20:05.920 --> 20:07.280
What of them? They're faster.

20:07.281 --> 20:09.559
So it is said... Reid.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.040
You have a type-printer?

20:30.440 --> 20:34.479
Hobbs. You were instructed,
were you not?

20:34.480 --> 20:37.639
Yes, Inspector. Well?
It's a bit of a handful.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.439
Come on, boy, this is the future!

20:39.440 --> 20:41.759
The lad might come to terms
with it sooner, sir,

20:41.760 --> 20:43.480
if you weren't stood so close.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.760
And that, Reid, is the
human barrier to progress.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.240
I'm home to change.
You need to rest, too.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.359
Captain Jackson.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.320
The tonic you took from her thighs,

21:00.321 --> 21:03.879
have you wondered whether it might
not be some kind of silver solution?

21:03.880 --> 21:05.880
From a peeper's dry plate?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.600
Emily.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.480
Have you been to church?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.999
I am home for a shirt.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.600
And now you go back.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.920
It cannot be helped. Of course.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.040
There is a particular reason
why I must return.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.920
Has he come? I don't know.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.120
I don't know, it might be.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.760
Please don't go out after nightfall.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.680
I'll get word to you if
I'm to be gone all night.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.600
I don't want you to worry. I know.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.680
No.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.999
Send the runner to Mr Reid.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.720
He'll be taking the Metropolitan.
Finchley's missing a violinist.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.360
Johnson!

23:09.560 --> 23:12.399
It's the call to send them
underground that troubles me, sir.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.799
Seems unnatural.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.599
Well, they're building more.
More trains, digging more tunnels.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.599
It means the city can spread out
and we can stop living like rats.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.399
What, and come live on these streets?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.599
Would you like that, Bennet?

23:24.600 --> 23:26.040
I'd like many things, sir.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.640
Is this it?

23:34.960 --> 23:36.720
(HE CHOKES)

23:38.760 --> 23:40.480
Mr Thwaites, sir? It's the police.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.080
Drake! Drake! I cannot hold him.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.359
What did Reid want?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.399
Weren't you taught to knock?

24:18.400 --> 24:21.039
The day you pay rent,
Jackson, I'll knock.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.159
Is that maniac on the strut again?

24:23.160 --> 24:24.520
Who? Reid?

24:27.480 --> 24:30.959
Relax, darlin'. You need to start
frisking men for knives again,

24:30.960 --> 24:33.120
I'll let you know. Now...

24:37.160 --> 24:39.999
Any of the girls
get their picture taken?

24:40.000 --> 24:43.759
Is this what brought Reid here?

24:43.760 --> 24:46.119
Jackson, that man could ruin us.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.519
He wants my help.
What am I supposed to do?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.599
You tell him sorry,
but you're indisposed?

24:50.600 --> 24:52.479
Fine. But he'll ask himself why.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.320
And me and you, we don't want that.

24:54.321 --> 24:57.440
You stop lavishing your care
and attention on him.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.599
Coming here was your idea.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.759
When we came here, you said this was
the kind of lawless shit swarm

25:03.760 --> 25:06.120
that we could hide ourselves
in and you were right.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.959
But, darling, in case you haven't
noticed, we're not hiding anymore.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.839
We live here. Now, if that man wants
to make a friend of me,

25:11.840 --> 25:13.159
he is welcome.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.719
Cos if he ain't a friend, he's
an enemy, and an enemy like that

25:15.720 --> 25:16.960
we do not need.

25:16.961 --> 25:21.080
So, please, which of the girls
has a leaning to smut?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.280
Myrtle!

25:36.320 --> 25:37.600
Get Rose up here.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.840
You can keep 'em if you like. I may.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.840
Where'd you get these done, Rose?

25:55.560 --> 25:58.359
Two men boarded a coach with some toff.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.040
Trimmed whiskers, moustache.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.279
Mr Thwaites, these men,
they put you up there?

26:05.280 --> 26:07.560
And the man Sergeant Drake
describes, do you know him?

26:08.600 --> 26:12.200
Were you here to talk about Maud?
My wife?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.080
Sir, you should prepare yourself.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.519
Whatever the outcome, it may be safer
for you to remain with us a while,

26:28.520 --> 26:30.280
Mr Thwaites, until we find those men.

26:30.281 --> 26:33.559
And I would apologise for where
I have been forced to lay her.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.360
She will be moved as soon
as circumstance allows.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.680
Oh, Maud.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.640
This is it.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.760
Queen of Sheba.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.320
Little Bo-Peep.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.240
Boadicea, Queen of the Britons.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.079
Rose?

27:50.080 --> 27:52.599
S'all right, Perce. He's with me.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.120
Thinking of joining up, ain't you?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.359
Business good?

27:57.360 --> 28:01.159
Never better. So long
as we don't get copped,

28:01.160 --> 28:03.119
and find the right distribution.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.879
Rosie here'll be lighting them
up in Blackpool.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.239
Sarah Bernhardt and I
shall be one of a piece.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.639
You already are, Rose.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.400
You already are.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.039
Don't you get cold out here?

28:30.040 --> 28:33.120
Wouldn't know. Never been
out here before.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.880
We have her name.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.680
We know how she was killed.
And nothing else.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.800
What does he want?

29:12.920 --> 29:17.040
Your lead, Inspector,
your notion about the dry plates.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.360
And this relates how?

29:21.400 --> 29:22.640
And we have this, too.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.279
It's more, er...

29:27.280 --> 29:29.519
evolved.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.199
That's disgusting!

29:31.200 --> 29:33.479
It's disgustingly remunerative.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.239
The act itself, Reid,
that's the future of smut.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.920
Maud Thwaites was caught up in this?

29:38.921 --> 29:41.319
It would fit.

29:41.320 --> 29:45.159
No streetwalker, but so recently
and energetically squired.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.799
The gelatine from a photographer's
plate on her thigh.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.040
I am in your debt.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.640
You tell me which scratch Drake
has taken his fall in tonight...

29:56.880 --> 29:58.120
I'll consider it paid.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.279
You've no right to ask me this thing.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.800
I fear I have every right, sir.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.559
Your wife's body bears the signs of
recent intimacy and I need to know if

30:11.560 --> 30:14.480
that intimacy was shared with
yourself. Of course it was.

30:16.720 --> 30:21.759
Mr Thwaites, why do you think
those men chose to string you up

30:21.760 --> 30:22.879
like they did?

30:22.880 --> 30:25.799
I've told you,
I have no idea who they were.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.839
No. I mean, there was trouble
taken to make it appear

30:29.840 --> 30:34.799
self-slaughter,
as if driven by guilt or shame.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.600
In any event, they wanted your silence.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.200
But just what is it they were
feared you might speak of?

30:41.760 --> 30:43.440
What shame, Mr Thwaites?

30:48.400 --> 30:53.000
This shame? Did your wife have
pictures taken like this?

30:56.560 --> 31:00.840
How far and how openly did your wife
share her... intimacy?

31:06.040 --> 31:07.560
Everything she did...

31:10.560 --> 31:11.760
she did for us.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.400
For me.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.840
So that my pride might not be ruined.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.759
When I found her, she lived
near here, in Whitechapel.

31:23.760 --> 31:27.799
She used to play for the
children of the orphanage

31:27.800 --> 31:31.519
on Criterion Street, from
where I hoped to deliver her.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.999
My church group, we raise
supplies for a number

31:34.000 --> 31:35.720
of poor schools in the borough.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.680
I loved her immediately.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.200
Before I married her, however...

31:50.520 --> 31:52.560
she confessed to a certain...

31:54.440 --> 31:55.879
practicality.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.880
But, as you say, you delivered her.
I did.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.160
I promised her comfort and dignity...

32:07.120 --> 32:10.200
pupils to be taken in her own
home. And she deceived you.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.279
No, Sergeant.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.520
The deception was mine.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.679
My...

32:21.680 --> 32:24.600
employment was not
as secure as I thought.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.560
I had no grounds to promise
her those things.

32:29.640 --> 32:33.519
Her home, even her violin,

32:33.520 --> 32:36.039
I mortgaged it all.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.880
And so she returned to Whitechapel.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.639
Where did she go? I don't know.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.079
Who did she go to? I don't know.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.600
Mr Thwaites, it's unwise to rile him.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.480
You think you can hurt me?

32:52.800 --> 32:56.879
Here, when my most profound
wish is that those men had

32:56.880 --> 32:59.439
succeeded in their task.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.479
Can't you see, Inspector,
that I am the last person

33:02.480 --> 33:07.159
who would ever know about the
things that she did because,

33:07.160 --> 33:10.040
as far as I was concerned...

33:11.160 --> 33:13.760
it wasn't happening, at all?

33:16.440 --> 33:18.639
What do you think?

33:18.640 --> 33:20.880
She was never Ripper, that girl.

33:21.880 --> 33:24.360
That killer prospers
by this radical smut.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.359
You really don't think it could have
been the husband, sir?

33:28.360 --> 33:31.439
The shame is too much,
he follows her. Kills her.

33:31.440 --> 33:35.120
He'd need lodgings.
Somewhere to work on her. No.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.559
Well, Sergeant, like it or not,

33:40.560 --> 33:43.719
Joseph Smeaton must draw
us away a while.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.760
Are you fit and able? Yes, sir.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.800
Don't fight it, pull on!

34:03.760 --> 34:06.160
This scratch is over. Corner.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.840
Come to, gentlemen. Fifth scratch.

34:31.880 --> 34:34.480
He ain't got to deal with it for too
much longer now, does he?

34:49.800 --> 34:52.320
Thought you said
he could be trusted! Hey?

35:15.560 --> 35:18.559
Do the count, do the count!
Count it! Hurry up!

35:18.560 --> 35:24.599
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

35:24.600 --> 35:28.120
four, three, two, one.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.640
Come and get your winnings, here we go!

35:34.280 --> 35:36.800
One for you, one for you, sir...

35:37.840 --> 35:39.320
Leave off. What's going on?

35:39.321 --> 35:41.919
Joseph Smeaton, I am arresting
you for the organisation of

35:41.920 --> 35:44.959
and the illicit profiteering
from proscribed and rigged fights.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.519
Put the irons on him.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.559
You're blue? Buckle me?

35:48.560 --> 35:51.799
You need to put the irons on every
man jack in east London!

35:51.800 --> 35:55.360
They'll be leaving their earnings
with someone new by the morning.

36:00.360 --> 36:04.720
Counterfeit currency. I shall send
you down for snide, too, Joe.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.240
Sir!

36:10.400 --> 36:14.560
Sir. The toff, whiskers, fight...

36:16.520 --> 36:18.040
There!

36:26.920 --> 36:29.080
Best make haste, Tucker. Yes, sir.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.359
If Thwaites has anything more
to tell us about this man,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.479
we are taking it this time. Thwaites.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.120
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

37:04.360 --> 37:07.120
Find Jackson. Yes, sir.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.439
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

37:18.440 --> 37:22.240
Mr Thwaites' particulars, sir.
Thank you, John.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.360
May I?

37:39.480 --> 37:41.079
Sweet girl.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.919
With dark secrets.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.959
We've all got secrets.
Even Sergeant Drake, here.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.158
I would be gentle with
Sergeant Drake, if I were you.

37:48.159 --> 37:49.638
He's of a mind to murder someone

37:49.639 --> 37:51.560
and tonight I do not
have the strength to...

37:54.840 --> 37:56.120
stop him.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.360
What do you see?

38:07.640 --> 38:09.880
Death and corruption. Look closer.

38:11.280 --> 38:16.079
There's a blemish. A mark on
the camera lens, most likely.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.920
The same place on each photograph.
The same camera.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.400
Creighton! Go on, Sergeant.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.960
False bottom.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.079
You may want to avert your eyes, Drake.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.520
This is some strong meat.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.160
I have her.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.320
Not much seems to be
beyond our Maud, does it?

39:24.480 --> 39:27.800
Hang on! That's him.
It's the toff!

39:42.440 --> 39:43.719
What is this?

39:43.720 --> 39:46.120
Look at this. It's all exactly
the same. Show me.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.039
No!

39:53.040 --> 39:54.720
Creighton!

40:04.600 --> 40:06.520
Water only inflames it.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.760
What kind of fire will not be doused?

40:09.761 --> 40:11.119
The door is bolted fast.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.080
Then all evidence dies here.
And all the men who know about it.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.720
Jackson, sheets, pass me the sheets.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.719
Clear out the space between the
hinges around the door with this.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.400
Do it, Sergeant!
Cut me some strips.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.000
Phosphorous. Flash powder.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.200
What's he doing? The crazy bastard's
making guncotton!

40:47.440 --> 40:48.480
Guncotton?!

40:57.360 --> 40:59.280
This one in the bottom. Of course.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.160
Come on! Back! Get back!

41:09.840 --> 41:12.279
You're just shanking it.
You got to aim right.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.000
You just take your time, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.360
Now what?

41:42.760 --> 41:45.519
I see these images all look identical,

41:45.520 --> 41:49.319
but by the end of the sequence, the
bird sits in a different position.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.479
There is a man,

41:51.480 --> 41:55.479
a Frenchman, Le Prince.
He's an engineer.

41:55.480 --> 41:59.639
He has been experimenting with
photographic images...

41:59.640 --> 42:00.800
that move.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.800
Like a lantern show? No, real.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.719
It's why the pictures appear
as a kind, because every

42:09.720 --> 42:14.119
degree of muscular movement has
to be captured with precision.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.840
So the end effect, therefore,
is fluid movement.

42:18.880 --> 42:23.959
It is the... it is the precise
details of our lives caught

42:23.960 --> 42:25.840
and re-presented to us.

42:28.480 --> 42:33.920
Now what... what if you
could make these images move?

42:35.200 --> 42:38.039
And be real? You see?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.119
You see the leash?

42:40.120 --> 42:45.279
Enough, perhaps, in a moment of
grotesque passion, to break her neck?

42:45.280 --> 42:49.159
And what if this entire moment had
been captured by this new camera?

42:49.160 --> 42:52.000
In the right circles,
it would make them a mint.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.000
Then they'd make more.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.480
This man. We must find this man.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.479
Oh...

43:42.480 --> 43:43.879
(SHE CLEARS THROAT)

43:43.880 --> 43:47.040
Evening, my ladies.
Good evening, sir.

43:54.680 --> 43:56.879
Turkish Delight?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.320
Thank you, sir.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.440
Mmm.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.160
Is there someone else in here, sir?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.720
No-one you need worry about.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.880
Here, take another.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.519
All your snitches, every tart,
landlord, bully and thief.

44:28.520 --> 44:31.239
He'll be wealthy, refined,

44:31.240 --> 44:33.040
ruthless.

44:34.040 --> 44:37.839
Artherton. I've come for her.
Where's Reid?

44:37.840 --> 44:40.480
The Inspector addresses his men.
All right.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.960
We only have these pictures,
we have no name.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.320
His name is Sir Arthur Donaldson.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.799
Summer '86, before your time here.

45:03.800 --> 45:07.159
He got his cock out at a church
picnic in Victoria Park,

45:07.160 --> 45:08.799
week or so later,

45:08.800 --> 45:12.519
tore the blouse off a pregnant
woman on the Stepney omnibus.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.959
Charged him but man from such a family

45:15.960 --> 45:18.560
as like to do jug as Victoria herself.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.759
The address was all
we ever had for him.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.080
Thank you, Fred. Go.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.240
Where's Rose, Susan?

45:53.040 --> 45:55.359
Rose isn't with us this morning,
Mr Jackson.

45:55.360 --> 45:56.800
Will one of our other girls serve?

45:59.000 --> 46:01.519
She has to hear what I have to say.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.839
She's got to stop with the smut.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.080
You squire her one day and
then you daddy her the next?

46:09.280 --> 46:12.280
What's the problem here, Susan?
Now you decide to get jealous?

46:14.360 --> 46:15.840
Jealous?

46:17.280 --> 46:22.519
I would rather shrivel and die alone
than let you near me again.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.040
Then get the girl.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.680
She's not here.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.919
She was ordered out
and is yet to be returned.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.000
They're late. And what's worse,
they paid me in snide.

46:39.400 --> 46:42.079
Who did? I don't know.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.759
A toff took two of them
away in his great charabanc.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.800
Right, get your hat. You're going to
see Reid. I'm doing no such thing.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.320
You touch me again and I will kill you.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.599
Oh, no, no, no, my beauty.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.039
You're coming with me.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.559
No.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.400
Tristan or Bertrand or whatever
your name is, I'm going home.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.480
I've paid for you, you're mine.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.800
Get off me!

48:03.320 --> 48:04.480
Get the door.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.200
No-one at home, sir?

48:23.560 --> 48:25.760
(SHE SHOUTS IN PAIN)

48:27.160 --> 48:30.079
Hobbs! Donaldson's friends
and relatives, The Telegraph.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.520
Scotland Yard must have their
names and addresses. Reid!

48:34.600 --> 48:36.280
Show and tell, Susan.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.919
Counterfeit, two of my girls
taken last night. Not yet returned.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.759
Black coach, one horse.
They paid in that.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.360
Smeaton! Come with me.

49:01.760 --> 49:05.760
(SHE GASPS IN PAIN)

49:12.240 --> 49:13.760
What's he doing?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.400
This snide. One of yours, I believe.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.559
There are mine all over the city.

49:29.560 --> 49:33.279
Only they're not. Arthur
Donaldson, where is he?

49:33.280 --> 49:35.079
What makes you think I know, eh?

49:35.080 --> 49:37.400
Sincerely? Not a great deal.
Instinct.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.199
Well, you can take your instinct

49:41.200 --> 49:44.559
and you can shove it up this
animal's fundament.

49:44.560 --> 49:45.880
Curse us.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.480
Shall we make another?

50:42.160 --> 50:43.200
(HE CROAKS)

50:44.480 --> 50:45.600
Huh?

50:49.160 --> 50:51.479
I need light.

50:51.480 --> 50:56.280
Imagine, a little thing like that
come between us and our enrichment!

50:57.880 --> 51:01.240
Light you shall have.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.840
(SHE SQUEALS)

51:13.840 --> 51:16.239
Where is Donaldson?

51:16.240 --> 51:19.160
He lives in Mayfair!

51:20.920 --> 51:23.599
We know that. He does no longer.

51:23.600 --> 51:27.120
(SHOUTING FROM BELOW)

51:29.040 --> 51:30.600
I only went there once!

51:32.320 --> 51:34.400
Well? Under our noses, sir.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.560
This will calm you.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.440
(SHE GURGLES)

52:54.960 --> 52:56.559
Downstairs.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.400
Donaldson! Arthur Donaldson!

53:04.720 --> 53:07.039
Myrtle, Myrtle, where is Rose?

53:07.040 --> 53:08.200
Jackson!

53:11.920 --> 53:13.360
Get the sword, Sergeant.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.800
Drake!

53:39.040 --> 53:40.320
Argh!

53:45.640 --> 53:48.080
(SHE COUGHS)

53:50.640 --> 53:51.960
Does she breathe, Sergeant?

53:51.961 --> 53:53.200
She does, sir.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.039
Whatever happens,

54:02.040 --> 54:06.440
whatever punishment is seen fit
for all this, that is extraordinary.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.760
(HE SCREAMS)

54:40.320 --> 54:41.440
This way.

54:56.760 --> 55:00.159
I thought... at last...

55:00.160 --> 55:02.279
I thought it was safe again.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.320
Ssh, now. It is, it is safe now.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.760
Thank you, Drake.
I'll tend to her now.

55:24.440 --> 55:27.320
Hey, Rosie, hey...

55:41.120 --> 55:42.560
Clear the way, lads.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.880
The facts.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.520
Have you lost your mind?

56:10.800 --> 56:12.239
Why?

56:12.240 --> 56:13.640
Because it is the truth.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.240
And I would have the world know it.

56:16.241 --> 56:19.319
She was never Ripper, that girl.
But you two...

56:19.320 --> 56:21.119
You, for profit.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.440
You, for guilt, I suspect,
wanted it so.

56:25.520 --> 56:28.119
Now I ask us to undertake this,

56:28.120 --> 56:31.199
that we find a little joy
in his continued absence.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.439
That we cease to look for him

56:33.440 --> 56:35.600
in every act of evil that
crosses our path.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.240
There is an abundance of that hereabout

56:39.241 --> 56:41.999
and I would have obsession blinker
us to the wider world no longer.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.640
Am I understood?

56:47.200 --> 56:48.840
Then get out.

57:04.080 --> 57:08.119
Edmund, this last year, that...

57:08.120 --> 57:12.559
lunatic will ever bind me to you.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.080
But you ask too much.

57:16.360 --> 57:21.000
He lives still,
he breathes this air still.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.920
These streets demand your vigilance.
No.

57:26.640 --> 57:28.799
We did everything in our power.

57:28.800 --> 57:31.679
Used every instrument allowed to us,
some that were not.

57:31.680 --> 57:35.360
All that we can hope for now
is that he is gone and stays gone.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
He will own my life no more.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.040
The men of Whitechapel do your
job for you, once more. Yeah!

58:32.120 --> 58:34.519
'He is my prisoner
and in my protection.'

58:34.520 --> 58:39.280
Then at the time of my choosing
we will end you all this night!
