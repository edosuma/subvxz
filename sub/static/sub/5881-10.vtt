WEBVTT

00:41.709 --> 00:44.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
running in the house.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.088
Grandpa's here! And Aunt Gloria!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.342
If I leave, can you
keep your mouth shut?

01:02.020 --> 01:04.230
Elizabeth, are you hiding
your sugar bowl from me?

01:04.314 --> 01:06.941
Gene, I think I have some packets
from Howard Johnson's.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.276
No, no.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.946
Daddy, have a saccharine or nothing.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.948
Where is your sugar bowl?

01:14.032 --> 01:17.452
Do you want to wake up
with a cold leg like Grandpa Herman?

01:17.536 --> 01:20.204
Diabetics don't live long ,
and sometimes they lose their legs.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.333
Grandpa!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.711
Good morning .

01:26.795 --> 01:28.254
Good to see you , Gene.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.339
Don.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.049
This is my friend Gloria.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.676
I heard you might be joining us.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.971
It's good to have another woman around ,
give Betty a break.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.431
Oh , I live to serve.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.099
Hey, you heard that, right?

01:40.184 --> 01:41.476
I have a witness.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.145
She's a hell of a sport.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.814
Don, will you help me with the suitcase?

01:46.899 --> 01:48.941
We're only going for the weekend .

01:49.026 --> 01:52.028
I can't get it out of the closet.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.906
Honestly, it's unseemly.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.365
I can imagine everyone at the club.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.993
"Was she waiting at the funeral
unbuttoning her top button

01:59.077 --> 02:00.995
like for some Sadie Hawkins dance?"

02:01.079 --> 02:03.247
She seems like a perfectly nice lady.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.001
What am I supposed
to do with this, fill it with hay?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.544
How far do you want to go with this?

02:08.629 --> 02:11.005
Oh, I'll say you talked me out of it.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.508
She's a vulture.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.885
Her husband was a failure.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.430
When he died , they found out
he'd cheated on his income taxes.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.516
And her kids. . .
Louise never married .

02:21.600 --> 02:25.144
Two more years and she'll be
hanging out at funerals, too.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.814
H untley. . .he was my brother's age.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.023
He was always "funny."

02:29.107 --> 02:33.069
Birdie, your father
was married, what, 40 years?

02:33.195 --> 02:36.739
The man can hardly fix himself a cup of tea,
let alone do laundry.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.699
All he needs is a housekeeper.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.117
A housekeeper goes home at night.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.410
Don.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.120
Let him have it.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.374
And that fake smile.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.918
You've been looking
forward to the beach.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.044
Let her cook.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.129
Let your father
put some stones by that wall

02:52.214 --> 02:55.007
so we stop getting water
underneath the deck.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.051
I guess I won't have to
worry about talking to her.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.303
She never stops.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.389
Just get through today.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.058
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon .

03:04.142 --> 03:06.060
We'll go to that place
with the lobster rolls.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.312
Just come now.

03:08.397 --> 03:13.025
You hate the way I drive, . .
but my father taught me.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.570
Half the office is cleared out.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.036
It's Kennedy, Kennedy,
Kennedy, Kennedy

03:24.121 --> 03:26.455
Kennedy, Kennedy, Ken-nedy for me

03:26.540 --> 03:29.166
Do you like a man
who has some spritz?

03:29.251 --> 03:31.168
A man who's always fair

03:31.253 --> 03:33.588
We'll wager him against the others

03:33.672 --> 03:35.798
And when you compare

03:35.883 --> 03:37.717
It looks like a Maypo ad .

03:37.801 --> 03:39.468
It's incredible.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.095
Happy days are here again .

03:41.179 --> 03:43.097
I'm just wild about Harry.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.558
It's light, it's fun ,

03:45.642 --> 03:49.437
it doesn't cloud the mind with,
I don't know, issues?

03:49.521 --> 03:50.646
And it's catchy.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.106
It's catchy like it gets in your head

03:52.190 --> 03:54.233
and makes you want
to blow your brains out.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.197
The president is a product, don't forget that.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.955
I would like to talk to you for a moment
about dollars and cents.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.957
Your dollars and cents.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.752
Now, my opponents want to increase
federal expenditures

04:12.836 --> 04:15.212
as much as $1 8 billion a year.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.965
How will they pay for it?

04:18.050 --> 04:19.800
There are only two ways.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.469
One is to raise your taxes.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.929
Turn it off.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.221
The other--

04:26.433 --> 04:30.144
An ad made by
a public relations team .

04:30.228 --> 04:32.313
Message received and forgotten .

04:32.397 --> 04:36.108
We should give this
to Franz for some music.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.236
N ixon's campaign song in the key of E .

04:39.321 --> 04:42.239
Ethel, go get the ice pick

04:43.325 --> 04:46.243
That Nixon guy is on TV again

04:46.328 --> 04:48.788
Should have never been this close.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.584
I'd say we could run them again ,
but I don't think you want to see them .

04:53.669 --> 04:54.669
Oh , I've seen them .

04:54.753 --> 04:57.546
Which reminds me, you people are not
watching enough television .

04:57.631 --> 05:00.424
It is your job. The shows and the ads.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.550
I was just wondering,

05:01.677 --> 05:05.304
there must be any number of people
harvesting mud on Johnny Kennedy right now.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.681
Have we heard anything?

05:06.765 --> 05:08.182
We hear things. Nothing useful.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.183
He's a womanizer.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.768
That's not going to hurt him .

05:10.852 --> 05:13.062
Women find out about that,
it'll push him over the top.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.147
N ixon is still ahead in the polls.

05:15.232 --> 05:18.109
Should have never been this close.

05:18.193 --> 05:22.113
Why do we need to attack
when there is a story to tell?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.241
Kennedy: nouveau riche,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.952
recent immigrant who bought his way
into Harvard .

05:28.036 --> 05:30.705
And now he's well-bred? Great.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.749
N ixon is from nothing .

05:33.834 --> 05:37.044
A self-made man,
the Abe Lincoln of California,

05:37.129 --> 05:38.713
who was Vice President of the United States

05:38.797 --> 05:41.507
six years after getting out of the Navy.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.300
Kennedy? I see a silver spoon .

05:43.385 --> 05:47.221
N ixon? I see myself.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.266
If we were to run a critical ad ,
there are obvious benefits.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.184
When you run an ad that's positive,

05:52.269 --> 05:53.894
you're only convincing people
who are already voting for you .

05:53.979 --> 05:55.229
But when you run an ad that's critical,

05:55.313 --> 05:56.647
you get a shot
at the people on the fence.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.858
There are a lot of people
on the fence.

05:58.942 --> 06:02.069
Gentlemen, whether the Nixon campaign
wants it or not,

06:02.154 --> 06:06.407
we have to produce a spot
that aims a Howitzer at Kennedy's balls.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.784
I want to hear ideas.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.244
After the long weekend .

06:10.328 --> 06:13.956
I agree. Let's go down swinging .

06:15.917 --> 06:18.294
If we can switch to a conversation
about paying clients,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.629
Menken's is coming in today
to sign off on the roll out.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.964
Father and daughter.

06:22.049 --> 06:26.802
I get the feeling old Abe Schmenken
can kill this whole thing .

06:26.887 --> 06:28.512
Of course, the checks
have cleared already,

06:28.597 --> 06:32.558
but. . ,Don , I want you to go in
and ride bare-back over Paul here.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.185
Done.

06:37.355 --> 06:41.233
And, uh, Don , I want you
on your best behavior.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.234
Excuse me?

06:42.319 --> 06:44.361
I know she bothers you .

06:57.626 --> 07:00.252
Miss Holloway, may I?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.176
I really need to get to the bottom of that.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.430
Yes, I would like to get a look at those.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.274
Margaret and Mona are off
to Block Island for Labor Day.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.319
Gone for the weekend
along with every other wife in town .

07:25.403 --> 07:26.570
We can go anywhere tonight.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.322
We can see a Broadway show,

07:28.406 --> 07:31.617
then sit at any table at The Colony
with our clothes off if we want to.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.078
How about a movie?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.579
Have you seen The Apartment?

07:35.664 --> 07:37.790
I went last week
with Mona and Margaret.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.708
I heard Shirley MacLaine is good .

07:39.793 --> 07:40.793
Oh , please.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.753
A white elevator operator?

07:42.838 --> 07:44.296
And a girl at that?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.090
I want to work at that place.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.716
Oh , I bet you do.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.385
The way those men treated that poor girl,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.470
handing her around
like a tray of canapes.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.140
She tried to commit suicide.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.016
So you saw it, huh?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.603
Ah , Red , that's not how it is.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.604
Look, it was crude.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.356
That's the way pictures are now.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.359
You see that ridiculous Psycho?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.444
Hollywood isn't happy
unless things are extreme.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.488
It didn't seem that extreme to me.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.657
Are we actually going
to get in a fight over a movie?

08:11.741 --> 08:15.494
You know, Mona had a dream once
where I hit the dog with the car.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.581
She was mad at me all day,
and I never hit the dog .

08:18.665 --> 08:21.167
We don't even have a dog .

08:23.170 --> 08:24.879
Why don't I call you later?

08:24.963 --> 08:26.714
Uh, Joannie. . .

08:26.798 --> 08:29.133
Call me soon ,
because we can go anywhere.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.720
The new atrium will make the store
brighter and more vibrant.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.138
The aisles will be wider,

08:34.222 --> 08:36.974
spotlighting these
new chrome display cases.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.101
Over here will be a new restaurant--

08:39.186 --> 08:40.394
An elegant tea room .

08:40.478 --> 08:43.314
Modern classic signs
and champagne linens.

08:43.398 --> 08:47.860
A tea room is nice,
but 30% of my ground floor

08:47.944 --> 08:50.654
is devoted to the restaurant business?

08:50.739 --> 08:54.366
Lunch and Shopping : a day of indulgence.
It's what ladies like.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.203
Yes, I saw that in the chapter here.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.455
It's much longer than the little schedule

08:59.539 --> 09:04.043
that says we have to close our doors
while it's getting nailed together.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.337
Three months of construction,

09:06.421 --> 09:10.382
during which time
we build enormous anticipation .

09:10.467 --> 09:12.218
Like a movie premier.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.928
The New Menken's.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.180
You will have a line that first day.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.141
Even if you have to pay
people to stand in it.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.392
We'll do whatever it takes.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.520
Mr. Draper, my daughter's presence here

09:23.605 --> 09:26.232
should let you know that
I am not against change.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.442
And let us assume that this is the most

09:28.526 --> 09:32.488
amazing idea in retail
since "buy one get one free."

09:33.531 --> 09:34.740
I still don't understand

09:34.824 --> 09:38.452
why we have to throw out
the baby with the water.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.789
Can't I keep what I have
and just build on it?

09:41.873 --> 09:49.129
Well, honestly, the unpleasant truth
is you don't have anything .

09:49.214 --> 09:52.967
Your customers cannot
be depended on anymore.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.051
Their lives have changed .

09:54.135 --> 09:56.470
They're prosperous.

09:56.554 --> 10:01.475
Over the years,
they've developed new tastes.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.769
They're like your daughter:

10:03.853 --> 10:07.398
educated, sophisticated .

10:07.482 --> 10:12.486
They know full well what they deserve,
and they're willing to pay for it.

10:12.570 --> 10:16.532
Why would I want to own a store
that I wouldn't want to shop in?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.493
M r. Menken, I don't know if that's true.

10:19.577 --> 10:23.205
You had no problem abandoning
that second-floor hosiery store

10:23.290 --> 10:25.082
on 7th Avenue
for your present location .

10:25.166 --> 10:28.460
And that's a story you'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren .

10:28.545 --> 10:31.463
The only problem is they won't care.

10:31.548 --> 10:35.342
As much as Grandpa
likes that marble palace,

10:35.427 --> 10:37.219
I can promise you , they won't.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.513
They'll look at it and they'll say,

10:39.597 --> 10:42.599
"Grandpa, it must have been hard
back in the olden days."

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
And it was.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.522
Everybody's jumping to forget it.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.776
Excuse me, but this is not
some phony story

10:52.861 --> 10:55.362
you people print in your
Fourth of July circulars.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.532
My father actually started with nothing,

10:58.616 --> 11:01.368
and he made it into everything
we're talking about.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.538
Who here can say that?

11:04.622 --> 11:06.373
I meant no disrespect, sir.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.000
None taken .

11:10.045 --> 11:11.628
This is the plan , Daddy.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.006
As you can see,
it wasn't just thrown together.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.550
It does seem very well thought out.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.635
It is.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.558
Pleasure to finally meet you .

11:24.642 --> 11:27.895
I hope you two know
what you're doing.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.485
Looks like we both get to keep our jobs
a little while longer.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.778
Don't screw this up.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.113
I think he likes me.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.658
I guarantee you there is nothing
about you he likes.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.660
What about you?

11:46.164 --> 11:48.165
Daddy, can we?

11:49.876 --> 11:53.003
This place reminds me
of a Czarist Ministry.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.590
No matter what the decision,
you don't feel it was yours.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.719
Fortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.389
He's very good . Persuasive.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.723
Yes.

12:04.808 --> 12:08.936
A little. . .dashing for my taste.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.114
Carol , it's 1 0:30.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.283
Did we have lunch ,
because even I can't leave this early.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.244
No, I needed to talk to you .

12:25.328 --> 12:28.038
Why aren't you at work?

12:28.123 --> 12:29.331
Don't tell me you're late again .

12:29.416 --> 12:30.666
Do you need to see Dr. Emerson?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.418
No. Good grief, Joan .

12:32.502 --> 12:33.419
Then what?

12:33.503 --> 12:35.170
You walked 1 2 blocks in a heat wave.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.840
And I see you didn't take my advice
about the dress shields.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.636
You know how Mr, Aldridge
has had me reading the slush pile?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.346
Yes, writing the rejection letters.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.515
You told me. It was depressing .

12:46.599 --> 12:49.476
I'm so stupid !

12:51.646 --> 12:53.647
This morning
in the submissions meeting ,

12:53.731 --> 12:56.024
the editorial director
asks why we haven't responded

12:56.109 --> 12:58.652
to this poet from Yale, Marlon Rice.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.864
Mr. Aldridge tells him we never saw it.

13:01.948 --> 13:06.326
The the director asks me,
and I cover for Mr. Aldridge.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.663
I said that I had read it and rejected it.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.666
Then they made Mr. Aldridge fire me.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.293
Oh, honey, that's awful.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.961
He was really sorry about it.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.672
- Of course. That SOB,
- I know.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.884
I'm going to have to ask
my dad for more money again .

13:21.968 --> 13:24.219
- It's humiliating.
- Stop it.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.264
You shouldn't be embarrassed ,
There's never enough money.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.725
You always seem to manage.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.851
These men .

13:30.935 --> 13:33.103
We're constantly building them up.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.563
And for what?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.106
Dinner, jewelry.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.691
Who cares?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.693
We need to go out
and shake all this gloominess.

13:39.777 --> 13:43.697
All I want to do is sit
in the movies and cry.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.157
No movies.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.576
Let's look for some actual bachelors.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.161
Empty their wallets.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.704
I hate Manhattan sometimes.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.706
Don't say that.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.791
This city is everything .

13:59.506 --> 14:01.715
Where's Howdy Dowdy at?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.217
What can I do for you?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.719
I just got off the phone with Brett Rowley
at Dr. Scholl's.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.723
Don't tell me they're coming in again
about the exercise sandals.

14:09.807 --> 14:10.766
Did you tell them summer's over?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.602
They're not coming in . Ever.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.728
They're going to Leo Burnett.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.730
What? Why didn't he call me?

14:16.814 --> 14:19.733
Probably because they were
disappointed with the creative.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.401
Rowley called it dull and humorless.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.904
- And what did you say?
- What could I say?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.405
I've never lost an account before.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.491
Especially one that was here before I got here.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.159
So you really put up a fight?

14:29.244 --> 14:31.745
He had very strong feelings.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.580
Said some unpleasant things.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.542
Which you don't remember
or I'm sure you'd tell me.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.840
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them .

14:48.137 --> 14:50.305
Are you going to tell
Sterling or should I?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.766
Unless you think it can wait
until after the weekend .

14:52.850 --> 14:54.560
I'll take care of it.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.240
Were you buzzing me?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.784
My intercom was making
a funny sound .

15:14.122 --> 15:15.247
Leave it.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.667
Do you wear Dr. Scholl's inserts?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.793
I thought we all had to.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.670
Take them out.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.381
Get rid of this, please.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.144
We lost Dr. Scholl's.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.396
Where?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.397
Leo Burnett.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.943
Campbell enjoyed telling me
it was something to do with creative.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.111
I thought I should tell you .

15:46.195 --> 15:47.821
Make sure the ink is dry on that raise.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.157
That fat piece of shit.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.825
He's a cigarette ash .

15:51.909 --> 15:54.202
Chicago. What a joke.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.996
Small time.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.457
Sorry, maybe you're from there.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.960
Well, I knowIdidn't drop the ball on this.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.337
Sales were steady.

16:03.421 --> 16:07.841
It probably didn't help that our billings
crept up for no apparent reason .

16:07.925 --> 16:12.095
Eventually, an accountant
is going to read the mail.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.097
If you're trying to cheer me up,
it's working .

16:14.182 --> 16:17.392
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them .

16:17.477 --> 16:18.685
You don't really believe that.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.103
You know what my father
used to say?

16:20.188 --> 16:22.856
Being with a client
is like being in a marriage.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.816
Sometimes you get into it
for the wrong reasons

16:24.901 --> 16:26.234
and eventually,
they hit you in the face.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.699
Damn it.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.992
Are we supposed to cry about this?

16:34.077 --> 16:36.036
So we lost an account.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.871
That means we'll just have to cut back.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.289
Let's go fire somebody.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.294
It's Labor Day weekend .

16:44.379 --> 16:48.674
Between now and Monday
we have to fall in love a dozen times.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.093
Betty's at the shore,
I'm headed down tomorrow.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.969
What do we work so hard for?

16:53.054 --> 16:55.389
To have enough money
to buy fabulous vacations

16:55.473 --> 16:57.265
for our families so we can live it up here.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.768
Give me tonight. You owe me that.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.354
I can use you as bait.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.565
There's a casting call at 4:00.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.734
Double-sided aluminum .

17:07.819 --> 17:08.902
If Freddie Rumsen's brain works

17:08.986 --> 17:11.071
the way I think it works,
slow and obvious,

17:11.155 --> 17:14.074
I think we should go down to casting
and see who's on the couch .

17:14.158 --> 17:16.868
Remember, Don,
when God closes a door,

17:16.953 --> 17:18.578
he opens a dress.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.962
What do you have there?
Precious cargo?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.923
M r. Rumsen has me trafficking
the Belle Jolie pouch .

17:30.007 --> 17:31.925
Aren't you a busy beaver?

17:32.009 --> 17:35.679
Hey, I'm talking to you .

17:37.432 --> 17:38.765
If you want to see the proofs,

17:38.850 --> 17:40.600
you'll have to check with Mr. Cosgrove.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.727
It's his account.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.021
Look at you . Minister of Protocol .

17:45.106 --> 17:47.149
So has Draper talked to Sterling yet?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.692
You'll have to ask him .

17:48.776 --> 17:49.818
I'm asking you .

17:49.902 --> 17:52.154
You should talk to him .

17:52.238 --> 17:53.655
What's wrong with you?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.907
Excuse me?

17:55.992 --> 17:58.952
I'm just trying to do my job
and you're making it very difficult.

17:59.036 --> 17:59.953
Peggy, dear.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.788
I think I understand what this is about.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.583
But you're not being professional right now.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.960
I cannot believe
I am in this conversation .

18:07.044 --> 18:09.963
You think this is easy for me?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.132
I don't know.

18:12.216 --> 18:16.553
I don't know if you like me
or if you don't like me.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.889
I'm just trying to get along here.

18:18.973 --> 18:25.520
And every time walk by, I wonder,
are you going to be nice to me?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.231
- Or cruel ,
- Cruel?

18:28.316 --> 18:30.567
What am I supposed to say?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.736
I'm married .

18:32.820 --> 18:34.029
Yes, I know.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.949
And I heard all about
how confusing that can be.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.912
Maybe you need me to lay on your couch
to clear that up for you again?

18:43.915 --> 18:46.833
That's some imagination you've got.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.001
Good thing you're a writer now.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.754
What do you need me for?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.347
It's incredible.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.265
I mean, we're just hanging out
in the art department

19:02.350 --> 19:03.850
and you two wander in .

19:03.935 --> 19:05.018
We thought it was casting .

19:05.102 --> 19:07.020
I wish it was.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.647
I'd definitely pick you two.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.024
I mean, you have
such an exquisite look.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.025
The bones of your face.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.028
And your sister, my goodness.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.615
You two look very different
when you pay attention .

19:18.699 --> 19:21.076
I have an older brother.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.036
My neighbors growing up had a dairy,

19:23.120 --> 19:25.372
and one of the cows
gave birth to two calves

19:25.456 --> 19:26.832
that were attached at the back.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.291
Then they cut them apart,

19:28.376 --> 19:31.419
but they always wanted
to be together.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.129
Is that what happened to you two?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.717
Do you like Ukrainian food?

19:37.802 --> 19:39.636
Let me ask you something , Draper.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.429
Do any of these men
have anything else to do?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.808
Just wanted to make sure
the girls were, you know. . .

19:44.892 --> 19:46.476
Matching?

19:46.561 --> 19:48.311
Exactly.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.069
Well, there you have it, Draper--

19:56.153 --> 20:00.156
double-sided aluminum
as envisioned by Sterling Cooper.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.415
Look at you .

20:08.499 --> 20:10.083
Roger Sterling .

20:10.167 --> 20:12.544
Eleanor. Eleanor Ames.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.590
What a great God that made two of you .

20:18.050 --> 20:19.384
Oh, what a sweet thing to say.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.012
Um , M irabelle.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.388
This is Donald Draper.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.015
He's our creative director here.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.351
What a pleasure to meet you .

20:28.436 --> 20:31.271
Well, honestly. . .

20:31.355 --> 20:33.440
I think we're going to send
everyone else home

20:33.524 --> 20:35.984
and use our authority to say that you two

20:36.068 --> 20:39.112
are the new faces of Cartwright
Double-Sided Aluminum .

20:39.196 --> 20:41.114
Oh, my God . Thank you .

20:41.198 --> 20:43.366
I think this calls for a celebration .

20:43.451 --> 20:44.951
Come on upstairs with us.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.495
One drink could be fun.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.747
One last question .

20:48.831 --> 20:50.248
How many birthdays have you had?

20:50.333 --> 20:52.334
20.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.335
How about her?

20:59.216 --> 21:01.051
You're coming , aren't you , Don?

21:13.397 --> 21:16.650
Aren't you two a pair of bookends.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.234
What do you say, Draper?

21:18.319 --> 21:20.654
Shall we cast them in bronze
and mount them on the credenza?

21:20.738 --> 21:22.072
Oh, my.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.616
Everything he says
means something else, too.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.577
It did get warm in here.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.162
They shut the air off at 5:00.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.248
Oh , Rochester, get her
an extra ice cube or something .

21:35.252 --> 21:39.589
So. . ,Mirabelle,
what's your special talent?

21:39.674 --> 21:43.927
Singing , dancing , baton twirling?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.595
I ride. Mostly dressage.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.057
She has a wall full of blue ribbons
back home in Winchester.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.434
Huh . You know, I have
a few awards myself.

21:53.104 --> 21:56.982
Look at your skin . It's translucent.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.776
That's "see-through ."

21:59.860 --> 22:01.528
Can I touch it?

22:03.781 --> 22:05.073
I don't see why not.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.283
After all, I do work here now.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.833
That tickles.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.377
Soft as a lamb's ear.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.171
Mm , you've got to feel this.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.090
I'm talking to you , Eleanor.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.059
Do you love your sister?

22:33.144 --> 22:35.103
Of course.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.396
Why don't you show her how much?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.856
Give her a kiss.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.691
Right now.

22:43.404 --> 22:46.573
Why do people always ask us that?

22:46.657 --> 22:49.659
My God , because
it's a beautiful thing .

22:51.328 --> 22:55.248
Well . . . I should be heading home.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.667
Wunderbar.Have a great night.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.627
You know what?
I think we should go, too.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.670
Oh , come on .

23:00.755 --> 23:03.256
Nobody's going anywhere.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.966
Do you want to dance?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.718
That's nice.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.344
Dance for us.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.390
I don't dance.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.562
Sure you do. Look at that.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.984
I feel like I'm stuck
somewhere between Doris Day

23:23.069 --> 23:25.987
inPillow TalkandMidnight Lace,

23:26.072 --> 23:29.157
when what I need to be is Kim Novak
in just about anything .

23:29.241 --> 23:31.451
You're prettier than Kim Novak.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.869
What a rut.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.122
1 960, I am so over you .

23:36.207 --> 23:37.207
Zip?

23:42.755 --> 23:43.671
Shalimar?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.007
Too much?

23:47.093 --> 23:49.260
You never say die, do you?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.386
What's the point?

23:52.807 --> 23:56.476
Oh , Carol, sweetie, it's not that bad .

23:56.560 --> 23:58.311
Tomorrow is another day.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.647
I know.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.148
I'm okay, actually.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.233
Good .

24:03.317 --> 24:05.318
No waterworks. Mascara.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.320
I'm just so happy right now.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.322
Okay, are you on the Gilbey's already?

24:09.406 --> 24:12.742
No. I just love this, you know?

24:12.827 --> 24:14.327
Being with you .

24:14.411 --> 24:17.288
We do know how to have fun , don't we?

24:18.707 --> 24:20.500
Joan . . .

24:22.419 --> 24:24.420
I love you .

24:24.505 --> 24:27.340
I really do.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.633
You .

24:32.763 --> 24:34.180
That first week in college,

24:34.265 --> 24:37.517
I saw you walking on the commons,

24:37.601 --> 24:42.772
and I thought, "Who is she?"

24:44.441 --> 24:48.444
Then college was over
and you came here. . .

24:48.529 --> 24:49.821
and I followed you .

24:52.449 --> 24:55.368
You needed a roommate.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.245
I moved in .

24:59.540 --> 25:01.791
Just to be near you .

25:03.961 --> 25:06.880
I did everything I could to be near you .

25:06.964 --> 25:09.382
All with the hope

25:09.466 --> 25:14.637
that one day. . .you would notice me.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.226
Joannie. . .

25:23.314 --> 25:25.857
just think of me as a boy.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.995
You've had a hard day.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.498
Let's go out and try
to forget about it, okay?

25:45.044 --> 25:47.587
Of course.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.507
Good , because I'm starving .

26:06.148 --> 26:07.732
They seem to be having a lot of fun .

26:24.124 --> 26:25.541
Do you have any gum?

26:27.711 --> 26:31.130
No. No, I don't.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.469
Listen, I should get going .

26:36.553 --> 26:39.138
Over to the left there. There ya go.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.807
Don't make me use my spurs on ya.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.475
Easy.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.562
Right over there by the trough .

26:55.072 --> 26:56.823
I really should go.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.577
Eleanor.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.539
I'll be right outside.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.499
Let her go.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.883
Listen . . .let me call you a car.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.553
I should wait for my sister.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.348
I mean, I've been around
the block a few times,

27:22.433 --> 27:25.226
but her. . .

27:25.311 --> 27:28.396
Now all you're thinking about
is going around the block, huh?

27:30.524 --> 27:34.527
I don't even think I can
get out of the driveway.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.739
Please, just wait with me?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.830
I like your office. It's really fancy.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.624
Mirabelle. Love that name.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.128
Listen to that.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.339
I haven't heard Margaret laugh
since she was 7.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.965
Who's Margaret?

27:56.050 --> 27:58.551
My daughter.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.554
Yeah, I think I like M irabelle
better than Margaret.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.557
I wanted to name her
Margaux, like the wine.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.351
Lost that battle.

28:06.435 --> 28:11.272
I'm sure she would have hated Margaux
almost as much as she hates Margaret.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.067
Why is she so angry?

28:14.151 --> 28:15.860
You're only a little older than her.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.111
You're not angry.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.616
Don't be sad .

28:23.202 --> 28:27.246
I just wish I could talk to her
without her rolling her eyes.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.748
Of course, she's right.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.249
I have nothing to say to her.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.460
I'm sure that's not so.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.587
Girls love their fathers.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.340
You have such beautiful skin .

28:37.424 --> 28:39.675
My God, I just want to eat it.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.429
I want to suck your blood like Dracula.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.874
Aren't you two the sweetest
for walking us up?

29:11.959 --> 29:13.626
You should be roommates.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.753
He seems to be a delightful young man .

29:15.838 --> 29:17.755
Ralph , you don't teach at Fordham also?

29:17.840 --> 29:20.091
No, we were just sitting
next to each other at the bar.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.093
and it seemed to be working .

29:22.177 --> 29:24.512
Carol, you know what we need? Ice.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.640
Now where is that gin hiding?

29:27.724 --> 29:30.977
Just so we're clear about what's what--
the redhead is mine.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.646
So, Franklin , you're into language.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.898
Yes, well , it's kind of a hobby of mine.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.443
I do carpentry. I'm building a dry sink.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.777
I love language.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.822
Words and their ways.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.199
Well, this is just bad speech .

29:45.284 --> 29:46.784
I collect it.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.829
There's this Polish janitor
in our building .

29:49.913 --> 29:52.498
His name is Stash or Stanislaus.

29:52.583 --> 29:56.419
He's locked me out of my office
on more than one occasion .

29:56.503 --> 30:03.426
One time, he described his bride
as "not speaking real good English ."

30:06.221 --> 30:08.014
I cherish that gift.

30:08.098 --> 30:11.476
Put that in a book and sell it.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.686
Well , this is a party, isn't it?

30:16.773 --> 30:19.692
I was wondering if I could
impose on the professor

30:19.776 --> 30:22.236
for one more teeny favor.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.698
I never say "no" to a beautiful girl.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.700
The light fixture in my room is out.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.869
Could you change it for me?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.246
I'm up to that task.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.501
We don't have a lot of men around here.

30:39.796 --> 30:43.799
Oh, it's not that dark.

30:47.638 --> 30:50.973
Well. . .what are we going to do?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.487
Whatever you want.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.283
You're married , aren't you?

31:09.368 --> 31:12.620
Yes. Yes, I am .

31:12.704 --> 31:15.748
Yeah, you kiss like a married man .

31:15.832 --> 31:18.251
Your own way, no talking you out of it.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.169
Is that good or bad?

31:20.254 --> 31:23.464
Oh , it's good .

31:23.549 --> 31:27.176
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

31:29.846 --> 31:34.850
Maybe it's this office,
but. . .you are selling too hard .

31:36.478 --> 31:37.812
Eleanor! Hello?

31:37.896 --> 31:41.023
Ellie, where are you? Something's wrong !

31:46.071 --> 31:47.697
Your friend-- Something's wrong .

31:47.781 --> 31:50.032
I knew I shouldn't have asked him
to do it a second time.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.785
Jesus.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.622
I-- I feel like
there's a tank on my chest.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.793
Just call an ambulance, and then leave.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.461
Is he okay?

32:03.839 --> 32:05.381
Leave.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.716
Right there!

32:21.898 --> 32:23.608
M irabelle. . .

32:23.692 --> 32:25.359
Oh, Mirabelle.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.325
Mona.

32:32.409 --> 32:35.161
Your wife's name is Mona.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.943
How you doing?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.576
All these years I thought
it would be the ulcer.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.665
I did everything they told me.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.918
Drank the cream , ate the butter,

33:24.002 --> 33:26.045
then I get hit with a coronary.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.886
Son of a bitch , it hurts.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.889
Well, you're talking . That's good .

33:36.973 --> 33:39.266
That's not what the doctors think.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.897
Don . . .

33:44.981 --> 33:47.191
do you believe in energy?

33:47.275 --> 33:48.359
What do you mean?

33:48.443 --> 33:53.864
Like the thing that
gives you get up and go?

33:53.949 --> 33:56.617
No.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.829
Like a human energy.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.042
I don't know, a. . .

34:08.004 --> 34:09.922
A soul?

34:10.006 --> 34:13.175
What do you want to hear?

34:14.553 --> 34:17.346
Jesus.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.683
I've been living the last 20 years
like I'm on shore leave.

34:20.767 --> 34:21.934
What the hell is that about?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.936
It's living .

34:24.020 --> 34:25.146
Just like you said .

34:26.523 --> 34:28.107
God .

34:31.486 --> 34:35.322
I wish I was going somewhere.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.500
He's doing great.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.127
Mona.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.971
I love you so much, Mona.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.347
Oh , God, I love you so much.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.225
I know. Sweetheart, I know.

35:16.865 --> 35:20.826
Listen to me, darling .

35:20.911 --> 35:22.995
Margaret is outside.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.413
- She needs to see you .
- No. No. No.

35:24.498 --> 35:27.082
I can't let her see me like this.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.506
Roger. . .

35:33.590 --> 35:36.675
I'm getting her.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.753
My goodness.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.382
All this from selling toilet paper.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.510
Mr. Cooper, where is everyone?

36:19.594 --> 36:21.929
My roommate just
gave me the message.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.055
Out.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.015
It's the middle of the night.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.725
I'm not leaving you here.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.477
You should go.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.145
Thank you .

36:31.314 --> 36:33.107
Suit yourself.

36:35.527 --> 36:39.280
M iss Holloway, Roger Sterling
has suffered a heart attack.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.532
What?

36:41.616 --> 36:45.452
He survived it, and is currently
being hospitalized .

36:45.537 --> 36:48.330
Now we need to immediately
send a telegram

36:48.415 --> 36:50.332
to every one of our clients

36:50.417 --> 36:53.752
assuring them that business will not
be interrupted .

36:53.837 --> 36:55.045
Of course.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.549
This is the master client list--
names, addresses.

36:58.633 --> 37:04.930
I'll read them out and you compose
the telegram , huh?

37:05.015 --> 37:08.726
Carl McElroy.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.896
President, Alpine Real Estate.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.653
It's me, Bets.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.030
Were you sleeping?

37:21.114 --> 37:22.364
Not really.

37:22.449 --> 37:25.242
The kids are in bed with me.

37:25.327 --> 37:28.245
Gloria and my father
made such a big deal

37:28.330 --> 37:31.123
about having separate bedrooms.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.751
Listen, Roger had a heart attack.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.921
What?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.130
Don, that's terrible.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.257
Is he going to be okay?

37:40.342 --> 37:43.594
The doctors basically
say they don't know.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.554
Mona's with him .

37:45.639 --> 37:47.264
She must be a wreck.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.975
It's good that you're there.

37:50.060 --> 37:53.395
- About tomorrow. , .
-No, I understand .

37:53.480 --> 37:56.148
Well, what happened?

37:56.232 --> 38:00.361
He was at work.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.154
He just keeled over.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.823
It was awful, actually.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.408
If the kids wouldn't be so heartbroken ,

38:06.493 --> 38:08.327
I'd come home now.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.331
I don't want to be here.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.918
You should have seen the two of them
in the kitchen tonight.

38:16.002 --> 38:19.296
She was making some
pot roast with ketchup

38:19.381 --> 38:24.093
and my father started hovering
behind her, watching,

38:24.177 --> 38:27.179
like he used to with my mother.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.932
How can he pretend
that she never existed?

38:30.016 --> 38:32.768
I still pick up the phone sometimes to call her.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.561
I don't know, Bets.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.943
I know people say life goes on ,

38:41.027 --> 38:44.196
and it does.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.740
But no one tells you
that's not a good thing .

38:46.825 --> 38:50.327
Why is that?

38:50.412 --> 38:54.039
I don't know.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.208
Stop thinking about that.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.169
I can't.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.713
I try.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.718
Do you want me to come up there?

39:07.887 --> 39:10.055
No. There's nothing you can do.

39:10.140 --> 39:14.226
Okay. Give Mona my love.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.394
And, Don. . .

39:15.478 --> 39:18.731
make sure you eat something .

39:24.320 --> 39:25.946
How's he doing?

39:26.031 --> 39:26.989
Not great.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.365
What happened?

39:30.326 --> 39:32.661
I don't know.

39:32.746 --> 39:35.497
Every Republican politician
wants you to believe

39:35.582 --> 39:39.293
that Richard Nixon is, quote, experienced.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.837
They even want you to believe
that he has actually

39:41.921 --> 39:43.839
been making decisions
in the White House.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.300
But listen to the man
who should know better:

39:46.384 --> 39:48.427
the President of the United States. . .

39:48.511 --> 39:50.304
I just wondered if you
could give us an example

39:50.388 --> 39:55.642
of a major idea of his that you had adopted
in that role as the decider.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.436
If you give me a week,
I might think of one.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.896
I don't remember.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.982
At the same press conference,
President Eisenhower said:

40:02.067 --> 40:05.027
No one can make
a decision except me.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.279
For real leadership in the '60s,

40:07.363 --> 40:10.532
help elect Senator
John F. Kennedy president.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.048
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.966
I got the telegram .

40:30.929 --> 40:33.055
Let me in .

40:33.139 --> 40:34.389
Are you okay?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.267
No.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.735
You look terrible.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.153
Can I get a drink?

40:48.238 --> 40:49.530
Of course.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.415
Are you happy with the doctors?

41:00.500 --> 41:02.876
I can have my father make a call .

41:05.004 --> 41:06.255
I don't know. He's rich .

41:06.339 --> 41:08.340
They seem to be taking care of him .

41:08.424 --> 41:10.217
Is he okay?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.597
You can tell me,
I'm not moving the account.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.642
He's gray and weak.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.649
His skin looks like paper.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.153
I'm sorry.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.114
He's your friend , isn't he?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.365
What's the difference?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.534
You don't want to lose him .

41:40.540 --> 41:42.374
Don , don't.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.709
What good is that going to do?

41:43.793 --> 41:46.503
Is this, like, some solar eclipse?

41:46.588 --> 41:49.381
The end of the world?
Just do whatever you want?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.383
- I don't know.
- You do.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.135
You're exhausted .

41:53.219 --> 41:54.595
You need to sleep, that's all.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.472
I just need to sit down .

42:05.481 --> 42:06.815
Sit with me.

42:06.900 --> 42:07.900
Why?

42:07.984 --> 42:10.569
Because I feel like you're looking
right through me over there.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.779
I'm not.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.920
I don't like feeling like this.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.963
No one does.

42:34.802 --> 42:39.473
I remember the first time
I was a pall bearer.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.893
I'd seen dead bodies before.

42:42.977 --> 42:45.520
I must have been 1 5. My aunt.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.109
I remember thinking . . .

42:51.194 --> 42:53.237
They're letting me carry the box.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.280
They're letting me be this close to it.

42:55.365 --> 42:59.493
No one is hiding
anything from me now.

42:59.577 --> 43:04.998
And I looked over,
and I saw all the old people

43:05.083 --> 43:08.377
waiting together by the grave.

43:08.461 --> 43:10.545
I remember thinking , I've. . .

43:13.466 --> 43:15.801
I've just moved up a notch .

43:17.637 --> 43:21.473
I've never heard you
talk that much before.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.559
- Rachel--
- What do you want from me?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.813
You know. I know you do.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.606
You know everything about me.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.650
I don't.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.783
You don't want to do this.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.827
You have a wife. You should go to her.

43:41.911 --> 43:43.870
Jesus, Rachel.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.290
This is it.

43:46.374 --> 43:49.459
This is all there is,
and I feel like it's slipping

43:49.544 --> 43:52.254
through my fingers
like a handful of sand .

43:54.173 --> 43:57.301
This is it.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.510
This is all there is.

43:58.594 --> 44:03.348
That's just an excuse for bad behavior.

44:03.433 --> 44:05.726
You don't really believe that.

44:29.334 --> 44:30.375
No.

44:30.460 --> 44:33.628
Not unless you tell me you want this.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.635
Yes, please.

45:00.531 --> 45:04.826
M iss Holloway, I know
it's none of my business,

45:04.911 --> 45:07.829
but you could do a lot better.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.581
He's just a friend .

45:09.665 --> 45:12.209
That's not what I'm
talking about, my dear.

45:12.293 --> 45:15.754
Don't waste your youth on age.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.805
Could you? Lobby.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.405
Do you want one?

45:41.489 --> 45:43.365
No.

45:53.751 --> 45:57.504
You told me
your mother died in childbirth .

45:59.006 --> 46:01.216
Mine did , too.

46:03.970 --> 46:06.221
She was a prostitute.

46:10.351 --> 46:12.144
I don't know what my father paid her,

46:12.228 --> 46:15.397
but when she died, they. . .

46:15.481 --> 46:18.733
brought me to him and his wife.

46:21.112 --> 46:26.408
And when I was 1 0 years old , he died .

46:28.369 --> 46:34.040
He was a drunk
who got kicked in the face by a horse.

46:37.545 --> 46:42.757
She buried him and took up
with some other man, and . . .

46:45.011 --> 46:50.640
I was raised
by those two sorry people.
