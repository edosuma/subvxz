How's your spaghetti?

00:08.093 --> 00:08.993
Good. How's yours?

00:09.095 --> 00:09.861
It's good.

00:09.963 --> 00:11.529
Brick! How's yours?

00:11.631 --> 00:12.897
Good!

00:15.402 --> 00:18.603
Dad! Code blue! There's a truck!

00:18.672 --> 00:21.773
False alarm. just movers.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.609
<i>After the basement flooded,
Mike jerry-rigged the pipes,</i>

00:24.711 --> 00:26.945
<i>but we needed a professional
to come and look at it.</i>

00:27.047 --> 00:29.147
<i>We were looking for
a plumber off the clock...</i>

00:29.249 --> 00:31.683
<i>someone who'd fix it for
20 bucks and a case of beer.</i>

00:31.751 --> 00:34.953
Dad, this is not a drill!
There's a van coming this way!

00:35.021 --> 00:37.188
It's a plumber! It's a plumber!

00:37.257 --> 00:38.189
You're sure?

00:38.258 --> 00:39.891
It has a picture of a dripping faucet

00:39.926 --> 00:42.330
and a self-effacing cartoon of a man

00:42.399 --> 00:44.240
with his pants pulled down
just enough to show crack.

00:44.264 --> 00:46.200
Bingo! We have plumber!

00:46.303 --> 00:48.198
He's coming from the Norwoods' driveway.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.013
He's going fast! Hurry!

00:50.194 --> 00:51.260
Stall him!

01:01.211 --> 01:02.910
Hi. Mike Heck.

01:08.379 --> 01:11.480
You know we only got seven more
months of community service?

01:11.582 --> 01:13.682
I'm actually gonna miss this.

01:13.751 --> 01:16.516
Okay. Ugh. It's your turn
to do the udder.

01:16.627 --> 01:18.196
I did the udder last time.

01:18.234 --> 01:19.634
Fine. Then you do the butt.

01:24.028 --> 01:25.627
So...

01:25.729 --> 01:28.931
hard to believe you're gonna be
done with college soon.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.532
I bet there's things you want to do

01:30.634 --> 01:32.034
that you didn't even get to.

01:32.136 --> 01:34.944
Never Saran Wrapped someone's room.

01:35.078 --> 01:36.311
Anything else?

01:36.413 --> 01:39.213
Eh, never tied someone up
and left them in an elevator.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.316
That's a felony.

01:40.383 --> 01:41.616
Anything else?

01:41.718 --> 01:44.263
Like maybe inviting
your brother up to campus

01:44.365 --> 01:46.098
for a weekend of fun,
like you said you were gonna do

01:46.122 --> 01:47.822
for the past four years but never did?

01:47.924 --> 01:49.691
That's not true! You came to visit.

01:49.793 --> 01:51.492
Once. And it was to help you study.

01:51.594 --> 01:52.594
We didn't have fun.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.762
Well, we're having fun
right now, little buddy.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.264
Court-mandated fun!

01:56.366 --> 01:57.366
Come on, Axl.

01:57.467 --> 01:58.844
Look, no offense... I just don't want

01:58.868 --> 02:00.346
to be hanging around with a 12-year-old.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.269
I'm 15.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.004
What?! Really?

02:04.007 --> 02:05.606
Okay, fine. You can come hang.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.219
We need tiny hands
to feel inside the walls

02:07.243 --> 02:09.009
and find out
what's running around in there.

02:16.786 --> 02:18.086
Oh, hey, Bill. How you doing?

02:18.154 --> 02:20.455
Good. I'm good. I'm doing good.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.557
Good.

02:21.591 --> 02:24.225
Yeah. So, um,
just talked to Ron Donahue.

02:24.327 --> 02:27.595
He said, uh, he saw my plumber
going into your house?

02:27.697 --> 02:30.365
Oh. Yeah. Remember that pipe
busted a month ago?

02:30.467 --> 02:33.401
It was still giving me trouble,
but Herb fixed it up great.

02:33.503 --> 02:34.702
Oh. Okay.

02:34.804 --> 02:37.171
So you made an appointment
with Herb, and then he came out?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.940
No... I saw him leaving your house,

02:39.042 --> 02:40.441
and I just flagged him down.

02:40.543 --> 02:43.211
That the way you hire people
now, Mike? You flag 'em down?

02:43.313 --> 02:44.779
Well, he was done at your house.

02:44.881 --> 02:46.292
- You poached my plumber!
- Aw, come on!

02:46.316 --> 02:47.548
Come on, where? Where?

02:47.650 --> 02:49.829
To a place where it's okay to
poach other people's plumbers?

02:49.853 --> 02:51.252
Look, he was off the clock.

02:51.354 --> 02:52.987
There's a way to do things, Mike.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.756
You look at the magnet on the fridge,

02:54.858 --> 02:56.657
and you call the plumber.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.471
That's it. That's why
they give you the magnet.

02:58.495 --> 03:00.072
Not so you can hold up
your kids' artwork.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.607
They don't care about
your kids' artwork!

03:01.631 --> 03:03.931
I think you're overreacting.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.012
Did you pay him the $80
service fee to come out here?

03:06.036 --> 03:07.235
No. He was already here.

03:07.337 --> 03:09.303
Yeah... 'cause I already paid
the 80 bucks!

03:09.406 --> 03:11.773
Okay, look, you know
things have been tight lately.

03:11.908 --> 03:14.742
I had a bread-heel sandwich for lunch.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.611
Are you really this angry about this?

03:16.713 --> 03:18.679
Yeah. It's kind of a big deal.
That's all.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.559
Okay, how about I split
the 80 bucks with you?

03:20.583 --> 03:23.451
That ship has sailed, Mike.

03:23.553 --> 03:25.531
But I'm sure if you saw that
ship coming down the street,

03:25.555 --> 03:27.588
you'd flag it down
and ask it to fix your plumbing!

03:27.690 --> 03:28.723
Hi, Bill.

03:28.825 --> 03:30.758
Hey, Frankie. How are you?
Nice... Nice top.

03:33.563 --> 03:35.530
You're not gonna believe this.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.765
Bill's mad I used his plumber.

03:38.086 --> 03:38.852
Really?

03:38.912 --> 03:40.312
"You used my plumber, Mike.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.447
There's a way of doing things, Mike.

03:42.516 --> 03:44.116
Yeah, I'm upset about it.

03:44.184 --> 03:46.318
Yeah. I make a big deal
out of small things. Yeah."

03:48.756 --> 03:50.656
Oh. Hi.

03:50.691 --> 03:53.525
Like to imitate people, Mike?
I can imitate people, too.

03:54.251 --> 03:55.284
"Hey, I'm Mike Heck.

03:55.386 --> 03:57.185
I like to flag down
other people's plumbers.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.154
I'm too cool for sunglasses."

03:59.256 --> 04:00.422
Hurts, doesn't it?

04:03.928 --> 04:07.362
Mm! I just love picnics.
They're so all-American.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.830
You just make some potato salad,

04:08.933 --> 04:10.599
grab your blanket
out of the oven, and go.

04:10.701 --> 04:13.368
I know, right? Dad doesn't get it.

04:13.437 --> 04:14.603
What's not to get?!

04:14.638 --> 04:17.272
It's like the world
is your television set.

04:17.374 --> 04:19.408
That's what <i> I</i> said!

04:19.476 --> 04:21.910
So, tell me about school.
What's the haps?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.613
Well, the bathroom near
my Spanish class went co-ed,

04:24.682 --> 04:26.315
so now I have to rush my poops.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.218
Hi, there.

04:33.457 --> 04:35.824
Hey. I'm Hudson. Liam.

04:35.893 --> 04:39.096
Hey. I'm Frankie. This is Sue.

04:39.168 --> 04:41.334
Sue? That's a pretty name.

04:41.397 --> 04:42.829
What's happening?

04:42.898 --> 04:44.965
We're new to Orson. How about you guys?

04:45.067 --> 04:47.594
Oh, no. We're old-timers.

04:47.708 --> 04:50.042
Well, I'm an older-timer than her.

04:50.094 --> 04:51.327
She's my daughter.

04:51.395 --> 04:53.929
Oh, come on. You must be sisters.

04:53.998 --> 04:56.198
Well, I did have her very young.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.800
And I drink a lot of water.

04:57.868 --> 05:00.269
Well, not water, really. Pop.
But that's got water in it.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.270
Anyway...

05:01.339 --> 05:03.005
Hey, let's play some Frisbee.

05:03.107 --> 05:05.507
Yeah! Let's get some cardio going.

05:06.777 --> 05:08.255
Do they expect us to play?

05:08.279 --> 05:09.623
I really don't understand
what's happening.

05:09.647 --> 05:10.916
I don't, either.

05:10.990 --> 05:12.390
Well, you're the mom! Do something!

05:12.425 --> 05:15.760
Don't be shy, ladies.
You can't play sitting.

05:15.795 --> 05:19.130
Oh, I don't know. There's
mayonnaise on our sandwiches.

05:19.232 --> 05:20.398
That's true.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.300
Uh, she doesn't lie. Moms don't lie.

05:25.305 --> 05:26.471
Let me show you something.

05:26.573 --> 05:27.653
You'll get a much better...

05:27.707 --> 05:28.907
Okay, you know what?

05:29.302 --> 05:30.646
We're just trying to enjoy our thing,

05:30.670 --> 05:32.247
and for you to come
and sit on our blanket,

05:32.271 --> 05:33.537
that... that's just weird.

05:33.606 --> 05:36.073
Next time, just bring
your own blanket and sit on it.

05:36.175 --> 05:38.209
I-I don't mean that
in a "Happy Days" way.

05:38.277 --> 05:39.310
Not like, "Sit on it!"

05:39.412 --> 05:42.513
Just... sit on your own blanket.

05:42.615 --> 05:45.116
I'm trying to be polite but firm.

05:45.151 --> 05:46.884
We thought you were part of the group.

05:47.732 --> 05:49.166
What group?

05:49.452 --> 05:50.955
The singles event.

05:55.061 --> 05:57.128
Oh, well, that's
much less inappropriate, then.

05:57.196 --> 05:58.529
Ohh.

05:58.631 --> 06:00.197
Uh...

06:00.266 --> 06:04.435
Please accept this frosting
as a little "my bad" gift.

06:04.504 --> 06:09.740
And we will just
scooch our blanket out of range.

06:09.842 --> 06:11.609
Okay. Good luck.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.094
Ugh! This weekend's gonna suck!

06:17.119 --> 06:18.730
I'm gonna have to
take Brick to the museum

06:18.754 --> 06:21.321
and the library and a bunch
of other nerd-tractions.

06:21.783 --> 06:23.263
Is he gonna want to read stuff to me?

06:23.318 --> 06:24.684
'Cause I don't like being read to.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.420
Look, I couldn't say no.
The kid worships me, man.

06:27.489 --> 06:29.366
I mean, I'm, like, the only
cool person in the family.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.202
And after this weekend,
he's got to go back there.

06:31.226 --> 06:32.291
It's sad.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.804
It's like when Tarzan
got to meet fancy people

06:33.828 --> 06:36.003
that eat with forks, and then he had to

06:36.072 --> 06:37.895
go back to the jungle
and live with the apes.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.410
Yeah, but Tarzan <i> wanted</i>
to go back to the jungle,

06:39.434 --> 06:41.033
so the apes are the cool ones.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.491
Well, then, I'm the apes.

06:42.593 --> 06:44.059
Either way, I should send him home

06:44.128 --> 06:46.261
with some of my old hair product
as a parting gift.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.697
Ugh!

06:51.202 --> 06:53.435
All right, Brick,
Kenny's at a convention,

06:53.537 --> 06:57.773
so you can sleep
in his chair/bed and/or table.

06:57.842 --> 06:59.508
And, uh, first up on the dork tour...

06:59.577 --> 07:01.977
I heard the science library's
doing something sciency.

07:02.079 --> 07:04.113
Oh, I'm not here for libraries.

07:04.181 --> 07:07.015
I am here to par-tay.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.751
Listen to this.

07:16.786 --> 07:19.453
So, I'm at the hardware store
just now. I see Bill.

07:19.555 --> 07:20.921
He didn't even wave at me.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.059
Did you wave to <i> him?</i>

07:25.128 --> 07:26.694
No. I don't wave at him.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.855
It's... not our relationship.

07:28.924 --> 07:31.825
Oh, great. Now I'm calling
what we have a relationship.

07:31.893 --> 07:33.971
Now I'm calling it "what we
have." What's happening?!

07:33.995 --> 07:35.595
What do you mean, you don't wave to him?

07:35.630 --> 07:37.464
He waves, then I nod. That's what we do.

07:37.566 --> 07:38.698
So did you nod?

07:38.767 --> 07:41.067
No, I didn't nod...
because he didn't wave.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.268
He waves, I nod.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.239
He failed to initiate
the sequence, not me.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.663
Seems complicated.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.466
I think we're in a fight...
only, it's kind of a girly one.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.575
And I'm not too thrilled
with Ron Donahue, either...

07:50.603 --> 07:51.936
clucking like a hen, telling Bill

07:52.005 --> 07:53.838
he saw his plumber coming over to me.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.807
Yep. You're in a girly fight.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.810
Who's Hudson?

07:58.878 --> 08:00.957
And why are you in a picture
playing Frisbee with him?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.159
And what's it mean, "Let me know
if your status changes"?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.516
Oh, my God. Aah!

08:05.618 --> 08:06.718
Sue, come here!

08:08.355 --> 08:09.887
Look, look, look.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.489
Oh, my God.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.857
Look at that.

08:12.892 --> 08:16.198
Okay. Somebody picked us up
at our picnic yesterday.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.153
Yeah. Somebody still wants to hit this.

08:18.222 --> 08:19.666
And I wasn't even wearing
those underpants.

08:19.690 --> 08:20.990
Boop, boop, boop!

08:21.058 --> 08:22.358
Hitting my thigh.

08:22.426 --> 08:24.760
And if I'm not waving,
I'm sure not dancing.

08:24.862 --> 08:26.473
Things happen
when you leave the house, Mike.

08:26.497 --> 08:28.097
It's called life!

08:28.199 --> 08:30.933
Hey, that Liam was really cute.
Maybe he'll text <i> you.</i>

08:31.002 --> 08:32.768
I don't know.
I kind of like someone else.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.270
You do?!

08:37.375 --> 08:39.475
Shut the door. Let's dish.

08:39.577 --> 08:42.044
So, who do you like?

08:42.145 --> 08:44.019
What's his name? Where's he from?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.440
Is he short? Is he tall?

08:45.509 --> 08:47.120
Is he <i> too</i> tall? There's
such a thing as too tall.

08:47.144 --> 08:48.576
Look, Mom, I don't even have

08:48.679 --> 08:50.578
any reason to believe that he likes me,

08:50.647 --> 08:52.714
so I don't really want to talk about it.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.450
You know what I'm hearing?

08:55.519 --> 08:58.153
That you <i> want</i> to tell me
but you're afraid to.

08:58.221 --> 08:59.499
That's not what I'm saying at all.

08:59.523 --> 09:01.034
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tickle, tell me!

09:01.058 --> 09:03.391
Aah! Aah! Aah! Mom! Stop! Stop! Stop!

09:03.460 --> 09:05.327
Okay. You don't have to tell me.

09:05.395 --> 09:06.395
I'll just guess.

09:06.430 --> 09:07.590
I'll go through the alphabet.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.531
Ah, aah... Arnie?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.732
Buh, buh... Brian?

09:10.834 --> 09:13.201
Cah? Duh? Eh? Fruh? Guh?

09:13.270 --> 09:15.238
You blinked on Guh.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.329
It's not Guh.

09:16.398 --> 09:17.398
Then why did you blink?

09:17.499 --> 09:18.499
Because I had to blink.

09:18.566 --> 09:19.566
Greg? Guy?

09:19.634 --> 09:20.867
Gui? Ooh! Is he French?

09:20.969 --> 09:22.035
Mom, cut it out!

09:22.137 --> 09:23.603
And please don't tickle me again.

09:23.672 --> 09:26.039
I have to pee a little, and I
really like this comforter.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.251
Sue, you tell me everything.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.142
You can't just cut me off cold turkey.

09:30.211 --> 09:32.978
Just give Mama a little taste,
and then I will be on my way.

09:33.047 --> 09:35.214
I need you to respect my privacy here.

09:36.217 --> 09:37.350
It's personal, Mom.

09:37.385 --> 09:39.385
I know you can understand that. Hmm?

09:39.487 --> 09:42.188
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.489
Okay.

09:45.159 --> 09:47.560
Hey. Is the nosy mom gone?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.995
It's just the two of us now.
You can tell me.

09:50.064 --> 09:51.909
Huh? Used to work when you were little.

09:51.933 --> 09:53.777
I thought I'd give it a try.

09:55.036 --> 09:56.402
Door open or closed?

09:56.504 --> 09:57.754
Okay, closed.

10:01.909 --> 10:03.442
Hey, man, have you seen Brick?

10:03.511 --> 10:06.560
I... can't find him anywhere.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.648
Oh, he's fine.

10:07.749 --> 10:09.148
I saw him doing a Scottish rap.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.184
Now he's in the back,
talking to some people.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.251
Wha...

10:12.353 --> 10:13.986
So, the whole joke
rests upon the premise

10:14.088 --> 10:15.555
that the guy's mother is ugly enough

10:15.657 --> 10:16.956
to be confused with a zoo animal

10:17.058 --> 10:19.058
and that if she had a ticket
to get out of the zoo,

10:19.093 --> 10:20.259
they would just let her out!

10:20.328 --> 10:22.597
If the mother looks like
an animal in the first place,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.066
she wouldn't need a ticket to get in.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.068
They'd just shoot her with an
elephant gun and stick her in a cage.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.593
Thank you!

10:28.662 --> 10:30.762
Hey, Axl, great party. Uh, I just want...

10:30.864 --> 10:32.263
Hi, Danna. Just one... one second.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.231
Oh.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.168
Want to get rid of everybody? Tired?

10:37.270 --> 10:39.470
What's your bedtime now? 7:00? 8:00?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.406
You keep forgetting
I'm not a kid anymore.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.508
I've got a girlfriend.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.467
I've pulled a prank with my mom and dad.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.294
You don't think I can par-tay?

10:46.363 --> 10:48.864
I can par-tay har-tay.

10:48.932 --> 10:51.333
Don't say "par-tay." Or "har-tay."

10:51.435 --> 10:52.579
Also "membrane." It skeeves me.

10:52.603 --> 10:53.913
It's the reason I'm not a doctor.

10:53.937 --> 10:56.738
I actually think we can
liven things up a little here.

10:56.807 --> 10:58.774
Might be time to crank the Como.

10:58.876 --> 11:00.242
What?! No!

11:00.310 --> 11:01.977
Drugs are not cool! Stay in school!

11:02.046 --> 11:04.212
I'm talking about <i>Perry</i> Como.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.825
Perry Como, Crystal Meth...

11:06.875 --> 11:08.819
giving them first names
doesn't take away the danger!

11:08.843 --> 11:10.043
What is happening to you?!

11:10.111 --> 11:12.178
Didn't you ever listen
to Aunt Edie's old records?

11:12.247 --> 11:13.846
- God, no!
- Are you kidding me?

11:13.915 --> 11:17.016
Henry Mancini, Andy Williams...

11:17.052 --> 11:19.085
That's a boss bunch of cats
in that collection.

11:19.154 --> 11:21.921
And Perry Como is
the bossest of them all.

11:21.957 --> 11:23.923
He'd really give this party
the kick it needs.

11:23.992 --> 11:25.892
Yeah!

11:25.994 --> 11:27.460
That's what I'm talking about.

11:27.529 --> 11:29.596
Just try and <i> not</i> move. You can't.

11:33.969 --> 11:35.902
This is not how I thought
the party was gonna go,

11:36.004 --> 11:37.070
but I'm not mad at it.

11:48.398 --> 11:49.398
♪ Hunh!

11:52.871 --> 11:54.581
What is wrong with you?

11:54.606 --> 11:56.840
Can you tell me quietly? The TV's on.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.490
I just got off the phone with Paula.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.117
She said Bill is beside himself.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.685
You ran over his oranges?

12:01.788 --> 12:02.920
I was just driving.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.500
He's the one that lost control
of his oranges.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.956
Well, Paula said that Bill said

12:06.025 --> 12:07.758
you intentionally drove over his oranges

12:07.794 --> 12:10.428
and you gave an evil smile
while you were doing it.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.475
I didn't give an evil smile.

12:12.577 --> 12:13.756
You're giving one right now.

12:13.825 --> 12:15.846
He is really mad at you, Mike.

12:15.871 --> 12:17.837
That's <i> his</i> problem. I got no problem.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.561
Oh, you got a <i> big</i> problem, buddy.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.996
We don't have so many friends

12:21.032 --> 12:23.198
that we can just let them go
willy-nilly.

12:23.267 --> 12:25.434
You think the Donahues
are gonna take our side on this?

12:25.469 --> 12:28.237
They're all we've got.
And we do nothing for them.

12:28.306 --> 12:29.471
We're like the little birds

12:29.507 --> 12:31.307
on the back of a hippo
picking the bugs off,

12:31.375 --> 12:33.676
and you are really
messing with that now.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.494
Why are you in such a bad mood?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.589
I'm losing Sue.

12:37.691 --> 12:38.764
What?

12:38.832 --> 12:40.158
She won't tell me who she likes.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.403
She won't even tickle-tell me.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.504
She used to tell me everything,

12:42.528 --> 12:43.973
and now she doesn't
want my advice at all.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.808
Well, that's not <i> your</i> problem.
That's <i> her</i> problem.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.598
You're making <i> her</i> problem <i>your</i> problem.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.700
That's your problem.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.769
<i>You're</i> my problem.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.181
All right, Brick.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.283
I need to sleep.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.450
Me too. I'm really tired.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.474
So I don't need no one to read to me.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.962
Sleep?

13:09.997 --> 13:11.831
Is this college or a nursing home?

13:11.933 --> 13:13.699
Come on! Let's go do something!

13:13.801 --> 13:15.167
Let's Saran Wrap someone's room.

13:15.236 --> 13:16.911
Let's do the walk of shame!

13:16.936 --> 13:18.524
Yeah, that doesn't mean
what you think it does.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.781
Let's pull an all-nighter!

13:19.850 --> 13:21.716
That just means
staying up all night studying.

13:21.785 --> 13:23.685
Come on! I'm up for anything!

13:23.787 --> 13:26.321
I'm at college, man.

13:26.356 --> 13:28.256
I want to bite into
the grapefruit of life

13:28.325 --> 13:29.991
and let the juices drip down my chin,

13:30.060 --> 13:31.926
and then immediately
put on hydrocortisone

13:31.995 --> 13:33.361
because I'm prone to eczema.

13:33.430 --> 13:36.631
I'm tired! I just want to sleep.
It's 2:00 a.m.!

13:36.733 --> 13:38.543
Hey, it's 5:00 <i> somewhere.</i>

13:38.568 --> 13:40.034
Mnh-mnh... that's something else

13:40.059 --> 13:41.214
that doesn't mean
what you think it does.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.370
Axl, this is my last chance

13:42.472 --> 13:44.706
to spend time with you at college.

13:44.808 --> 13:45.974
Please!

13:46.042 --> 13:48.443
Ugh! Why do you idolize me so much?

13:48.545 --> 13:49.878
Why am I so amazing?

13:49.946 --> 13:51.045
All right. Fine.

13:51.114 --> 13:53.114
The agricultural students
usually have something

13:53.216 --> 13:55.643
going on in one of their birthing barns.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.502
It's like a party in a barn.
It's called a barty.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.505
You're on me for "par-tay,"
but "barty" is okay?

14:01.574 --> 14:02.907
I didn't name it, Brick.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.009
Ehh.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.265
Hey, there. Who you texting?

14:09.474 --> 14:10.474
Just Lexie.

14:10.508 --> 14:12.119
I'm letting her know
I'm gonna take a shower,

14:12.143 --> 14:13.654
and then I'll leave here
in about an hour,

14:13.678 --> 14:15.389
and then she'll know
I'll be there in 46 minutes...

14:15.413 --> 14:16.512
42 minutes to get there

14:16.581 --> 14:18.025
and then a four-minute window
for extra padding,

14:18.049 --> 14:20.009
and then if I'm not there,
she'll call the police.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.562
<i>I know it's wrong,
but they say if you notice</i>

14:32.631 --> 14:34.163
<i>any behavioral changes in your child,</i>

14:34.232 --> 14:36.733
<i>it's your duty as a mother to snoop.</i>

14:36.801 --> 14:38.668
<i>Now, what was her password?</i>

14:38.737 --> 14:40.803
<i>"GirlsRock."</i>

14:40.872 --> 14:42.605
<i>Shoot!</i>

14:42.641 --> 14:43.806
<i>I'm doing this for</i> her.

14:43.875 --> 14:46.209
<i>This is my baby, my little princess.</i>

14:46.278 --> 14:48.946
<i>"Princess." Ooh! Okay.</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:50.604
<i>Uh... Belle?</i>

14:51.741 --> 14:53.374
<i>Crap!</i>

14:53.476 --> 14:54.708
<i>Ariel?</i>

14:54.744 --> 14:56.343
<i>Crap!</i>

14:56.445 --> 14:58.045
<i>What's the name of that Indian one?</i>

14:58.114 --> 14:59.513
<i>I mean, Native American one.</i>

14:59.582 --> 15:02.149
<i>I don't really need to be
politically correct in my head,</i>

15:02.218 --> 15:03.613
<i>but it's nice that I am.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:04.947
<i>And I just did that automatically</i>

15:04.971 --> 15:06.011
<i>without thinking about it.</i>

15:06.072 --> 15:07.512
<i>That proves I'm a really nice person</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:09.807
<i>and was not just pretending to be.</i>

15:09.876 --> 15:11.308
<i>I wish I had more black friends.</i>

15:11.377 --> 15:13.477
<i>Pocahontas!</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:15.312
<i>Damn it!</i>

15:21.212 --> 15:22.678
So, what's next on our agenda?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.481
Oh, my God! There's nothing left!

15:25.550 --> 15:27.250
We spit off the clock tower,

15:27.318 --> 15:29.919
we got in a tater tot fight
in the cafeteria,

15:29.954 --> 15:32.822
we partied with farmers,
we watched a lamb get born.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.524
I'm just gonna lay my face down

15:34.559 --> 15:36.092
on this pancake like a pillow.

15:36.194 --> 15:38.272
Ooh! Wait a minute. Pancake pillow.

15:38.296 --> 15:40.029
Write that down. We're gonna be rich.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.965
Ahh.

15:43.034 --> 15:45.848
You know, Axl, I want to thank you.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.154
You really showed me a great time.

15:48.222 --> 15:50.790
Yeah, you know, it turned out
to be more fun than I thought.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.527
Oh, hey! Look at this.

15:54.629 --> 15:56.061
Eat while you sleep.

15:56.097 --> 15:57.741
Now we just got to use science
to figure out

15:57.765 --> 15:59.676
how big a pancake to cover
a typical night's sleep.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.000
What is that... like, 13 hours?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.216
Hey, there's that girl
from the party last night

16:06.240 --> 16:07.306
who likes you.

16:07.408 --> 16:08.408
Wha...?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.209
Oh. Danna? Nah.

16:10.278 --> 16:12.055
She's just a friend.
I don't think she likes me.

16:12.079 --> 16:13.712
Axl, she couldn't have been
more obvious.

16:13.781 --> 16:16.087
She kept wanting to talk to you,

16:16.229 --> 16:17.962
she kept dancing next to you.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.739
I'm not even good
at picking up social cues,

16:19.821 --> 16:20.954
and I got it.

16:20.989 --> 16:22.366
All right, look,
I just broke up with April.

16:22.390 --> 16:23.734
And then Devin and Cassidy showed up.

16:23.758 --> 16:26.459
The universe is telling me
to just hold off for now.

16:26.494 --> 16:28.072
You know, maybe I just
got to hang out with my bros.

16:28.096 --> 16:29.207
And my bro.

16:29.231 --> 16:31.164
Well, if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.032
But let me share
a little story with you.

16:33.101 --> 16:35.034
There's a secondhand shop near school

16:35.103 --> 16:37.655
that I used to go to every day,

16:37.830 --> 16:39.663
and they had this zebra bookmark...

16:39.732 --> 16:41.999
Write down "syrup pocket."
I'll know what it means.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.834
Sorry. Continue.

16:44.323 --> 16:47.324
Every time I'd go in the shop,
I'd feel the bookmark.

16:47.349 --> 16:48.515
I <i> loved</i> it.

16:48.654 --> 16:50.821
The contrast
between the black and white,

16:51.043 --> 16:52.743
the touch of the synthetic hair.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.311
And every day, I'd say,

16:54.380 --> 16:56.814
"Tomorrow, I'm gonna
come back and buy it."

16:56.882 --> 17:00.184
But then I went in there
one day, and it was gone.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.819
If this is your super-not-subtle way

17:01.887 --> 17:04.088
of asking me to buy you
a bookmark, it's not working.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.990
Uh, I guess the analogy is clearer to me

17:06.058 --> 17:08.259
because I like my women
like I like my bookmarks...

17:08.327 --> 17:09.159
long and skinny.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.096
You've seen Cindy. Growl!

17:12.164 --> 17:14.411
I'm uncomfortable.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.642
What I'm saying is,

17:16.710 --> 17:19.011
go out and get yourself a bookmark.

17:20.481 --> 17:21.791
But I don't want a bookmar...

17:21.816 --> 17:23.693
"Bookmarks" equals "girls"!
I'm talking about girls!

17:23.717 --> 17:25.217
Go get one before it's too late!

17:25.319 --> 17:26.385
What are you waiting for?!

17:26.453 --> 17:27.853
Huh.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.154
It's either my lack of sleep

17:29.223 --> 17:31.190
or you're starting to
make some sense here, Brick.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.025
You know, Brick,
you're really growing up.

17:33.127 --> 17:34.259
I mean, we <i> both</i> are.

17:34.361 --> 17:35.294
We're men.

17:35.362 --> 17:37.342
We're Heck men.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.657
It's up to us to carry on the Heck name.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.826
Yeah. I guess it is.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.627
So, now I'm gonna take your advice.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.729
I'm gonna go get me a bookmark...

17:45.832 --> 17:47.164
the girl kind.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.510
It's so weird. I could've sworn
I put it down on the counter.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.744
No, I don't think you did.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.191
I'm pretty sure
you put it over on the table.

18:17.813 --> 18:19.746
Well... I guess it's probably

18:19.815 --> 18:22.149
as good a time as any to tell you...

18:22.218 --> 18:23.383
I got you a new phone.

18:23.486 --> 18:24.685
You did? Why?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.954
'Cause I love you,
and it's my right to spoil you.

18:27.056 --> 18:29.156
And there ain't nothin'
you can do about it.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.924
This is Brick's phone. No, it's not.

18:30.993 --> 18:33.126
Then why is Cindy's number
in here? And Troy's?

18:33.195 --> 18:36.345
And the Orson Library
and the Jasper Library

18:36.407 --> 18:37.873
and the Library of Congress?

18:37.975 --> 18:40.175
Okay, fine. It's Brick's phone.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.045
I was trying to break in to
your phone to see who you liked,

18:43.147 --> 18:44.746
and I dropped it and cracked it.

18:46.216 --> 18:48.884
But... And yes, I-I realize
that makes me a crazy person.

18:48.952 --> 18:51.653
But if you lived through
what I lived through with you,

18:51.722 --> 18:53.244
you would understand.

18:53.269 --> 18:54.769
Like, when you were in kindergarten,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.882
we had a special arrangement
with the nurse's office

18:56.944 --> 18:58.510
so you could call me every day at 10:00

18:58.612 --> 19:00.178
because you missed me so much.

19:00.247 --> 19:03.181
And you would only be
in Brownies if <i> I</i> was the leader.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.250
And people would tell me,
"Oh, girls are great

19:05.319 --> 19:07.652
when they're little,
but wait till she's a teenager."

19:07.721 --> 19:09.054
And then you <i> were</i> a teenager,

19:09.122 --> 19:11.323
and you were just as delightful,

19:11.391 --> 19:14.104
and I thought, "We are gonna be
best friends forever."

19:14.173 --> 19:15.794
And now...

19:15.829 --> 19:16.829
Come here, Mom.

19:16.930 --> 19:18.797
No. No! You don't want me.

19:18.899 --> 19:20.265
Yes, I do.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.972
Mom, I love you.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.327
And I understand why you want to know,

19:30.628 --> 19:33.161
but I'm not sure if he likes me,

19:33.230 --> 19:35.464
and I'm not sure
how much I really like him.

19:35.532 --> 19:37.032
So for right now,

19:37.101 --> 19:39.534
this is just a fun thing
for me to think about.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.003
But when I'm ready,

19:41.105 --> 19:44.139
you will be the first person
I come to to talk about it.

19:44.241 --> 19:46.108
Aww!

19:46.210 --> 19:47.509
Before Lexie? Before Dad?

19:47.611 --> 19:49.011
Obviously before Dad.

19:49.113 --> 19:51.580
Oh, and, by the way,
my password is "SueHeckWins."

19:51.649 --> 19:53.159
You might need it
in case there's an emergency

19:53.183 --> 19:54.294
and you need to call the police.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.651
Oh, shoot! Lexie!

20:10.934 --> 20:11.833
Wow.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.602
You really need to brush your teeth.

20:13.704 --> 20:14.803
Oh, God.

20:17.608 --> 20:19.374
I don't care.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.763
What's the problem?

20:49.898 --> 20:51.331
Battery's dead.

20:52.301 --> 20:54.134
Need a jump? I got cables.

20:55.537 --> 20:56.837
That'd be great.

20:58.273 --> 20:59.773
<i>It's a funny thing about guys.</i>

20:59.875 --> 21:03.610
<i>They don't apologize or hug
or rehash what went wrong.</i>

21:03.712 --> 21:06.079
<i>Guys mend fences the way guys do...</i>

21:06.181 --> 21:07.414
<i>with jumper cables.</i>

21:07.516 --> 21:08.516
Nice cables.

21:08.584 --> 21:10.750
Thanks. They're 18-footers.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.531
Hey, did you hear the one about the guy
who tried to get into a nice supper club,

21:13.555 --> 21:15.589
but he didn't have a tie,
so he used jumper cables?

21:15.724 --> 21:17.204
The maître d' said, "I'll let you in,

21:17.259 --> 21:19.459
but, uh, don't start anything."

21:20.863 --> 21:24.097
Yeah. You don't have to worry
about me poaching that one.
