WEBVTT

00:32.600 --> 00:33.500
Horatio.

00:34.300 --> 00:34.600
I didn't know

00:35.000 --> 00:35.800
this was your parish.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.600
Well, Father, when the...

00:38.400 --> 00:39.500
when the Cardinal from New York

00:39.600 --> 00:42.800
makes a surprise visit to Miami,

00:43.000 --> 00:43.700
word gets around.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.400
You coming to confess a new sin?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.700
No... same one.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.400
You're angry.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.600
Father, I am... I am confused.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Guilt... takes many forms.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.300
Father, I have been over this

01:08.700 --> 01:10.300
and over this a thousand times,

01:10.400 --> 01:15.500
and I am certain with every fiber in my body
that I couldn't have done anything differently.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.000
I told you when you came to me

01:18.800 --> 01:19.700
those many years ago

01:20.800 --> 01:21.900
with blood on your hands

01:23.600 --> 01:25.300
that it isn't about the life that you took

01:25.900 --> 01:29.700
It's about the lives you make right in the here and now.
And that's what God is judging you on.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.500
I know what my penance is.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.300
So why are you here?

01:36.200 --> 01:37.400
I need you to tell me.

01:43.700 --> 01:48.300
When you've done enough, Horatio,

01:48.300 --> 01:48.700
you'll know.

01:52.100 --> 01:52.900
Let us pray.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.100
Oh, my God...

01:56.200 --> 01:58.700
I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee...

02:00.300 --> 02:01.500
and I detest all my sins

02:02.900 --> 02:05.900
because I dread the loss of
Heaven and the pains of Hell.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.100
Most of all because I have offended Thee, my God...

02:29.700 --> 02:31.300
Sorry about the causeway traffic, man.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.100
Let's go.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.400
Can you take these off?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.300
You know I can't do that.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.600
Madre, Please!

03:10.900 --> 03:11.200
Stop!

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Stop now!

03:14.100 --> 03:14.800
Fuentes!

03:17.600 --> 03:17.800
Madre.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.900
...to confess my sins, to do penance...

03:34.800 --> 03:35.000
Father...

03:36.400 --> 03:38.800
I... have to go.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.000
Yo, come on!

04:40.300 --> 04:40.800
Hang on.

04:41.400 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, I have got shots fired at Holy Redeemer Cemetery.
Suspect is leaving by the main gate.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.200
I need rescue and backup right now.

04:53.100 --> 04:53.300
Here we go.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.500
We don't get fooled again.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.500
Don't get fooled again

05:25.300 --> 05:26.300
No, no.

06:03.400 --> 06:03.500
Frank.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.500
Guy pops out of a casket,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.200
and shoots Aberto Fuentes here.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.500
Had to be some sort of a switch.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.200
Send a detective unit to the mortuary, please.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.200
Aberto's got ink, Horatio.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
Looks like a pitchfork.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.700
It is a pitchfork.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.400
He's Mala Noche, guys.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.900
What was he in prison for, Frank?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.900
Relatives said cocaine distribution.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.500
Thought the Noches weren't
allowed to sell drugs.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.000
Gang rule.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.000
Which means his own gang killed him.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.200
How much does an escort
guard cost for a family funeral?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.600
10K in a cashier's check.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.300
Let's find out who ponied up
the money for Aberto here, all right?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.000
I'll talk to the prison and get back to you.

07:06.800 --> 07:13.300
The FBI considers the Mala Noche the most dangerous
crime organization in the United States, ladies and gentlemen.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.800
They stay away from drugs
to avoid deportation,

07:15.900 --> 07:19.700
but what they specialize in
is murder for hire, extortion...

07:20.500 --> 07:21.400
the list goes on.

07:22.100 --> 07:22.600
In short

07:22.700 --> 07:24.300
they are Miami's new Mafia.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.800
Now, I must tell you that they have
already killed six police officers.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.500
Trying to scare us, Horatio?

07:30.900 --> 07:35.700
Born in the Nicaraguan wars,
they have no fear.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.100
So anyone not interested,
I'll understand.

07:42.100 --> 07:42.900
We're in if you're in.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.400
Okay, good.
Eric,the hearse.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.300
The thing's a tank.
It's probably halfway up 95 by now.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.900
Check the road. I may have hit it.

07:50.300 --> 07:50.400
Done.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.100
Oh, um...

07:52.900 --> 07:55.800
I forgot.
Welcome back.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.400
That is a lot of firepower.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.100
These guys are serious gangsters.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.600
Mafia, my ass.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.900
If you ask me, they're a bunch of cowards
who shot innocent people attending a funeral.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.600
You know what, you don't have to see these casings
to know they were using an automatic, either.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.200
Oh, are you collecting DNA?

08:25.900 --> 08:26.200
Yeah.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.800
According to the witness,
he was wearing a bandana.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.700
The guy was lying in the casket, waiting.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.500
No way was he wearing a bandana.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.300
Good obs.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.700
I'm going to go help Delko.

08:48.100 --> 08:48.900
How about a quote?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.700
Hey,you,get behind the tape, please.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.700
Rookie cop already confirmed
that it was the Noches.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.100
This is a crime scene.
You want to get arrested?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
Let's pack it up, guys.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.900
Does this mean we're not having dinner again?

09:01.300 --> 09:05.000
Erica, you made me look like a slime bag
in front of my colleagues last month.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.000
You can forget dinner
and you can forget anything.

09:07.100 --> 09:07.900
Now go.

09:08.400 --> 09:08.700
All right.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.100
You don't have to get all Bith on me.

09:16.400 --> 09:16.700
Horatio.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.400
Yeah.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.700
I got a name on Aberto's benefactor.

09:21.300 --> 09:36.800
Star Island. What a nice address, Frank.

09:38.900 --> 09:39.300
Michelle Burke?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.700
Who let you in?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.700
Miami-Dade, ma'am.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.100
Do you know him?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.700
Oh, my God, he's...

09:46.800 --> 09:48.600
Yeah, he was shot today at his mother's funeral.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.600
Prison officials said that you put up the money
for Aberto's escort from the prison to the funeral.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.800
A funeral you didn't attend.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.000
We broke up when he went on the inside.
The money was a favor.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.300
A favor to who?
Aberto or the man who killed him?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.100
What?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.400
If you think I set him up...

10:01.600 --> 10:06.100
If you think getting passed around by a bunch of criminals
is going to give you street cred with your Richie Rich friends,

10:06.300 --> 10:07.100
well, guess again.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.900
'Cause right now you're an accomplice to murder.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.500
I want to know who the shooter is.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.400
I don't know his real name.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
He went by "Diablo."

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
When was the last time you spoke to Diablo?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.200
I've been calling him all morning.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.400
He's not answering.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.200
Here's what I want you to do.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.300
The minute he calls you, you call me.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.500
Do you understand?

10:41.700 --> 10:44.100
I know that Horatio hit the tank,
but the leak stopped.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.700
There's no way they stopped to fix it.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.400
No, no. Gas rushes to one end.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.200
Because the tank isn't full.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.400
Are you extrapolating the rate of
the leak to get the escape radius?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.500
Yeah. I'm estimating a six-percent grade
would be sufficient to stop the leakage.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.200
Okay, so if the tank capacity is 18 gallons,

11:12.700 --> 11:18.400
the engine burns 14 miles a gallon,
and you've got a 200-yard continuous leak...

11:21.600 --> 11:23.300
Gives us a five-mile radius on the house.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.300
Okay, I'll call dispatch, put out a broadcast.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.200
Two suspects armed, extremely dangerous.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.900
Get in touch with H.

12:13.100 --> 12:13.900
Ma'am?

12:16.100 --> 12:17.100
Are you okay, ma'am?

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
They took our car.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.400
I try not to give them the keys.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.300
Where are the car keys?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.200
I don't know.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.100
Give us the keys.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.900
Or I'll break your jaw.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.200
I'll call rescue.
Put a broadcast out on the family car.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.000
Horatio, there's lunch on this table,
and the food's still warm.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.800
Ma'am, where is the family?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.200
They have a panic room.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.900
Please don't leave me.

12:50.100 --> 12:50.500
Please.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.300
I won't leave you ,ma'am

12:53.800 --> 12:54.100
Who are they?!

12:54.900 --> 12:57.800
It's okay, ma'am.They're going to take you
to the hospital and get you checked out.

12:58.200 --> 12:58.400
It's okay.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.000
Checked out?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.800
Yes, a forensics nurse is going to take some samples.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.700
I can't do that.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
It is the best way to find out who did this to you.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.800
I'm pregnant.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.300
All I care about is my baby.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.100
Ma'am, it won't hurt the baby.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.600
I can't take that chance.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.100
Um... okay.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.000
I'll find another way.

13:36.730 --> 13:37.630
Miami-Dade Police.

13:38.230 --> 13:38.930
You can come out now.

13:46.830 --> 13:47.930
Your house has been secured.

13:48.030 --> 13:48.930
Come on, boys.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.030
Thank God you're here.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.130
Yeah. We're lucky we have a panic room.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.530
Your housekeeper wasn't so lucky.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.730
She was downstairs when they crashed the front gate.

14:02.930 --> 14:03.830
I had to protect my boys.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.930
Is Celia all right?

14:05.930 --> 14:08.830
Couple of thugs had a go at her while you
guys were hiding out. What do you think?

14:20.130 --> 14:21.430
Hang on a second, guys.

14:21.630 --> 14:22.730
Aren't you coming with me?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.930
I'm going to be right behind you, Celia.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.530
Bag the sheets from the gurney.
They're critical.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.230
I'll bag and seal them myself.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.830
Appreciate it.

14:36.030 --> 14:36.330
Lieutenant Caine.

14:36.630 --> 14:37.830
Mr. Livingston.

14:40.230 --> 14:41.130
Is Celia going to be all right?

14:41.230 --> 14:44.230
She'd be a lot better if you would have
let her in that crawlspace of yours.

14:45.630 --> 14:46.530
I just... my family...

14:47.030 --> 14:48.830
Do you have medical insurance for your employees?

14:49.030 --> 14:49.930
No. Not for household...

14:50.030 --> 14:51.830
You do now. You're paying
for her hospital stay.

14:52.730 --> 14:53.030
Right.

15:33.330 --> 15:33.930
What is it?

15:34.530 --> 15:35.530
Some sort of alkali.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.730
Must have been on the suspect's shoes.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.530
So maybe we can find out where
they've been hanging out?

15:41.230 --> 15:44.630
It's a start. Then, hopefully, the Trace lab
will point us in the right direction.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.630
So this is Aberto's mother.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.330
Detective said whoever
made the switch dumped her out.

15:53.730 --> 15:55.930
Left the body in the back room of the mortuary.

15:57.430 --> 15:58.130
Poor woman.

16:00.730 --> 16:01.630
What's all that?

16:01.730 --> 16:03.530
Mrs. Fuentes had a pacemaker.

16:04.630 --> 16:09.130
And, according to the data I've downloaded,
she died of a heart attack.

16:10.830 --> 16:13.230
Just around the time her son's enemies
wanted a funeral? That's convenient.

16:14.530 --> 16:16.530
Mm-hmm. Too convenient.

16:17.330 --> 16:21.130
According to her heart rate,
she was under extreme stress before she died.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.130
Extreme stress or extreme fear?

16:29.030 --> 16:30.130
I don't know, Eric.

16:30.730 --> 16:32.730
Could a Mala Noche scare you to death?

16:34.030 --> 16:35.530
The question is, how can we prove that?

16:36.230 --> 16:37.330
What's that mark on her cheek?

16:37.830 --> 16:38.730
I don't know.

16:39.030 --> 16:40.030
It's antemortem.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.530
Looks like an impression of something.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.330
Lord only knows what they did to her.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.030
Look, I'm going to be at this
woman's house and see what I can find.

17:55.930 --> 17:56.930
Scared her to death.

18:23.230 --> 18:26.030
Wow! I thought they were
only going to do the floors.

18:26.130 --> 18:27.330
Yeah. They did a lot more than that.

18:27.530 --> 18:28.630
You should see the labs.

18:29.230 --> 18:30.330
Must have cost a fortune.

18:30.830 --> 18:31.230
You can thank me.

18:31.330 --> 18:35.030
Okay. Who are you?

18:35.630 --> 18:37.030
Natalia Boa Vista, DNA.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.730
Boa, like a snake.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.230
So, uh... did you do the rebuild,
or you just pay for it?

18:44.430 --> 18:45.330
Actually, I paid.

18:45.630 --> 18:48.430
Wow. I think I should dump Tox and get into DNA.

18:48.830 --> 18:50.330
This is not out of Dade County's budget.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.630
I had to get a federal grant.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.230
I got DNA from the cemetery shooting.
Can I throw it on the pile?

18:54.730 --> 18:56.730
Nope. It's unsolveds only.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.030
But nice to meet you.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.030
Later, guys.

19:00.930 --> 19:02.330
Thanks.

19:02.330 --> 19:03.230
Big help.

19:03.230 --> 19:04.030
Glad to have you.

19:05.030 --> 19:05.530
Firearms.

19:05.630 --> 19:05.930
Trace.

19:09.730 --> 19:16.430
In an exclusive, Channel 4 News learned a powerful Miami gang
opened fire on an interment at Holy Redeemer Cemetery today.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.230
Four people were killed.

19:18.830 --> 19:21.630
Reacting to the Mala Noche's
most brazen attack to date,

19:21.830 --> 19:25.630
a legislative delegation from South Florida
has just arrived from Tallahassee.

19:26.130 --> 19:28.430
This lawlessness will not be tolerated.

19:28.730 --> 19:32.630
We are extending every possible resource
to the Miami-Dade Police Department,

19:32.830 --> 19:35.330
whose top investigators are on the case,

19:35.630 --> 19:42.930
led by Lieutenant Horatio Caine.

19:42.930 --> 19:43.330
Hey, Dan.

19:44.830 --> 19:45.730
You're on TV.

19:47.630 --> 19:48.730
"New Mafia," my ass.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.130
She just won't stop.

19:55.530 --> 19:56.430
You know that girl?

19:58.230 --> 20:01.130
I'm Erica Sikes reporting for Channel 4 News.

20:01.730 --> 20:02.130
She's hot.

20:02.230 --> 20:04.130
She's a case against the First Amendment.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.130
Going to give her hell?

20:07.630 --> 20:09.130
Not yet. Horatio has a rush.

20:22.230 --> 20:23.730
Paramedics turned over this evidence.

20:24.230 --> 20:26.030
They're sheets from Celia Gonzalez's gurney.

20:26.330 --> 20:27.630
It's all we've got. Get it to DNA.

20:28.030 --> 20:28.730
I'll go right there.

20:33.930 --> 20:34.530
How's she doing?

20:35.330 --> 20:37.830
It'll take some time,
but I think she'll recover nicely.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.730
And the baby?

21:04.830 --> 21:05.430
How you feeling?

21:06.830 --> 21:09.030
I saw you talking to the doctor.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.830
It's bad news, isn't it?

21:14.930 --> 21:15.930
Celia, the baby's gone.

21:17.230 --> 21:17.830
I'm sorry.

21:23.430 --> 21:26.530
Is there... is there anybody I...
I can call?

21:26.830 --> 21:27.430
The child's father?

21:29.330 --> 21:29.630
No.

21:31.030 --> 21:31.730
He's married.

21:33.830 --> 21:34.530
With a family.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.030
Okay.

21:42.230 --> 21:42.730
Celia

21:44.930 --> 21:47.230
Is the child's father Mr. Livingston, your boss?

21:51.730 --> 21:53.430
I hope you don't think less of me.

21:54.330 --> 21:55.330
No.

21:56.330 --> 21:57.130
Of course I don't.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.130
Okay. You rest now.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.830
I ran the samples from your home invasion.

22:17.230 --> 22:17.630
Great.

22:20.430 --> 22:21.230
Calcium carbonate,

22:21.430 --> 22:22.330
calcium hydroxide,

22:22.830 --> 22:23.430
magnesium.

22:24.830 --> 22:26.430
Limestone. Fantastic.

22:26.630 --> 22:27.730
South Florida's covered in it.

22:28.030 --> 22:31.030
This is processed limestone with a bonus: magnesium.

22:31.330 --> 22:32.430
Will you put that in context?

22:32.630 --> 22:36.830
Magnesium is added to reduce the acidity
of sulfur dioxide emissions from power stations.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.030
So we're looking for a limestone
mine with a processing plant.

22:40.230 --> 22:41.530
May not be as difficult as it sounds.

22:41.730 --> 22:43.030
These places are open 24/7.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.930
Well, that does narrow everything down.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.430
No gang is going to hang out at a busy plant.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.530
Abandoned processing mine on
the edge of the Glades.

22:57.330 --> 22:57.730
Horatio,

22:58.630 --> 23:01.130
I think we may have just found
the location of the Mala Noches' hideout.

23:38.230 --> 23:38.930
Get on the ground!

23:39.130 --> 23:39.730
Get on the ground now!

23:40.130 --> 23:41.030
Move! Move! Move!

23:41.030 --> 23:42.930
Move now! Now!

23:55.130 --> 23:55.830
So, Raphael...

23:57.430 --> 23:59.630
you and your buddies shot up the cemetery,

24:00.830 --> 24:03.030
and then broke into the Livingston house, didn't you?

24:03.830 --> 24:05.630
Yo, you got some good story there, B.

24:06.230 --> 24:06.830
So do you.

24:08.830 --> 24:09.530
Take him outside.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.730
So what? Prints? DNA?

24:25.930 --> 24:27.230
Full process, Eric.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.130
All right.

24:33.530 --> 24:34.730
Some serious artwork.

24:36.130 --> 24:37.930
Yes. Mala Noche.

24:38.530 --> 24:39.130
Right, Raphael?

24:41.030 --> 24:42.130
Yeah, you got that right.

24:43.130 --> 24:44.530
Noche's international, yo.

24:45.130 --> 24:46.930
Better than Cosa Nostra ever was.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.230
Capone, Gotti...they don't even compare.

24:50.830 --> 24:51.930
You raped a young woman

24:52.430 --> 24:55.330
and killed the baby she was carrying.
I bet you're proud of that, huh?

24:55.830 --> 24:58.130
Yo, I was you, I'd worry about my own neck.

24:58.530 --> 24:59.330
Is that a fact?

25:03.830 --> 25:04.730
Yeah, if I was you...

25:05.730 --> 25:06.430
Lieutenant Caine.

25:10.630 --> 25:13.030
Raphael, are you telling me
there's a green light on me?

25:14.030 --> 25:16.130
Approved by the bosses.
Straight from Nicaragua.

25:17.530 --> 25:19.730
You and your lab are the first
real trouble we've had in Miami.

25:20.630 --> 25:21.530
And we don't like trouble.

25:26.730 --> 25:27.130
Eric...

25:28.730 --> 25:30.130
Get the prisoner. Go, go, go!

25:30.830 --> 25:32.630
East ridge! East ridge!
Spread to your left!

25:33.130 --> 25:34.530
He's at the tree line!

25:36.130 --> 25:36.530
What do you see?!

25:38.530 --> 25:39.630
Two! There's two!

25:42.330 --> 25:44.830
They're on the run. They're on the run.
Still 50 yards away.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.630
They're gone. GOA.

26:00.330 --> 26:00.930
Sniper's GOA.

26:01.630 --> 26:03.230
They're gone. Area's secure.

26:10.430 --> 26:11.430
You're never going to win this war.

26:12.430 --> 26:13.230
That's what you think.

26:24.630 --> 26:25.430
Just got your message.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.030
Like seeing yourself on TV?

26:28.530 --> 26:30.630
Look, this isn't some Boy Scout troop
you're investigating, all right?

26:30.730 --> 26:31.730
This gang is lethal.

26:31.930 --> 26:32.330
They don't scare me.

26:32.530 --> 26:34.530
Well, they scare me. And they already
put out a green light on my boss.

26:34.730 --> 26:35.530
A green light?

26:35.530 --> 26:35.930
It's a hit.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.530
These guys, they're gonna kill
anyone that gets in their way.

26:40.330 --> 26:43.430
You wouldn't have asked me to bring my recorder
unless you wanted to put all this on tape.

26:44.430 --> 26:46.030
Erica, you know me so well.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.230
You want to do that last part, about the hit?

26:54.630 --> 26:55.230
Sure.

26:57.030 --> 26:57.630
Come on.

27:01.530 --> 27:04.630
Lose my name, lose my number.
I don't ever want to hear from you again. You get that?

27:13.730 --> 27:14.730
Valera, you have my data?

27:19.630 --> 27:20.330
It's got to be wrong.

27:20.930 --> 27:21.630
No, Eric, sorry.

27:22.530 --> 27:24.830
All right, look, run it again.
I got this guy sitting in PD.

27:25.030 --> 27:26.630
I ran doubles on all the samples.

27:26.830 --> 27:27.430
Same results.

27:28.230 --> 27:32.030
The reference sample from the semen on the maid's
sheet does not match your Raphael Sifuentes.

27:33.730 --> 27:34.530
All right. That's okay.

27:35.030 --> 27:35.830
We got him for murder.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.830
His prints are on the grenade
that scared Mrs. Fuentes to death.

27:39.730 --> 27:42.930
Great. One more thing about the DNA.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.730
Casket shooter does match.

27:47.330 --> 27:49.830
So whoever this is, is your rapist.

27:51.930 --> 27:52.430
Okay, good.

27:52.830 --> 27:53.830
I'll tell H.

27:57.730 --> 27:58.230
Horatio.

27:58.830 --> 28:00.730
SWAT found a few casings along the tree line.

28:01.530 --> 28:01.930
That's it.

28:02.330 --> 28:03.730
Officers are waiting on your team up there now.

28:06.130 --> 28:10.230
See, the question becomes, Frank,
why would Mala Noche be here?

28:10.530 --> 28:10.930
I don't know.

28:11.630 --> 28:13.030
Calleigh's in there now, hunting around.

28:13.730 --> 28:15.830
Okay,if she finds anything, I'll be on the ridge.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.430
So what were Mala Noche packing up in here?

28:39.230 --> 28:40.130
Rand-new putters.

28:40.830 --> 28:41.530
And they're heavy.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.430
Hey,that's evidence.

28:46.030 --> 28:47.030
Couldn't help my game anyway.

28:49.030 --> 28:50.130
Seems odd, doesn't it?

28:50.130 --> 28:53.230
The clubs have already been shipped,
and yet they're being opened and repackaged.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.730
Why repackage them in the
old packages once they're here?

28:56.430 --> 28:57.230
I don't know.

29:01.630 --> 29:02.430
Read film bags.

29:05.730 --> 29:06.930
Film bags for golf clubs?

29:07.430 --> 29:08.830
To get something through security, maybe.

29:09.630 --> 29:10.730
Makes you wonder what they're hiding.

29:14.730 --> 29:15.230
Black canisters.

29:17.530 --> 29:18.030
Really?

29:18.530 --> 29:19.630
They're hiding black canisters?

29:19.930 --> 29:20.330
No.

29:21.330 --> 29:25.330
Eric found a grenade at a victim's house.
And grenades are typically shipped in canisters like that.

29:26.630 --> 29:29.930
It would be very easy to conceal inside
a shipment of lead-composite golf clubs.

29:35.430 --> 29:36.230
These canisters are empty.

29:36.630 --> 29:37.230
Where's the grenades?

29:43.430 --> 29:43.930
Hey, Calleigh,

29:45.230 --> 29:45.830
take a look at this.

29:46.830 --> 29:47.830
The original shipping crate.

29:48.430 --> 29:49.230
Yeah, but look at the name.

29:53.030 --> 29:54.430
How's business, Mr. Livingston?

29:54.730 --> 29:55.630
Good. Good.

29:55.930 --> 29:57.430
Lot of growth in sporting equipment.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.130
Lot of growth in grenade running, too.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.730
Yes, you import hand grenades
for the Mala Noche, don't you?

30:03.630 --> 30:05.730
And you hide them in your
shipments of custom putters.

30:06.130 --> 30:10.330
Because the lead in the clubs disguises
the contents of the shipment, doesn't it?

30:21.730 --> 30:23.630
I never wanted any part of these guys.

30:24.030 --> 30:24.630
Except for their money.

30:27.730 --> 30:28.330
Detective?

30:29.430 --> 30:32.630
We found a cash account you opened
last year at Coral Gables Savings.

30:33.430 --> 30:34.730
And you got a pretty penny in there, too.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.030
They made me open it.

30:37.630 --> 30:40.930
They said if I got a taste,
I could never go to the police.

30:41.730 --> 30:43.130
I never withdrew one penny.

30:43.630 --> 30:44.530
Look at my account. Have I?

30:47.630 --> 30:48.530
He hasn't, Horatio.

30:48.630 --> 30:49.830
How'd you work the shipments?

30:50.330 --> 30:55.730
They would doctor the crates at my South American manufacturer,
ship them here, liberate their stuff at the quarry.

30:56.430 --> 30:58.230
Then they'd let me have my merchandise back.

31:00.730 --> 31:01.430
Hey.

31:01.730 --> 31:02.530
These are mine, eh?

31:02.530 --> 31:05.330
Hey, you guys never said anything
about taking clubs.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.130
Oh, no?

31:06.230 --> 31:06.630
No.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.230
Okay. Here.

31:16.830 --> 31:17.530
Shut up.

31:17.830 --> 31:20.330
Or next time, it'll be your kids.
Understand?

31:21.930 --> 31:22.730
They called him "Diablo."

31:23.030 --> 31:24.830
That's when I built the panic room.

31:25.430 --> 31:26.730
The one you wouldn't let Celia in.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.730
Just one of the mistakes I've made in her regard.

31:29.830 --> 31:32.930
Yes, I'm aware of all of the mistakes
you've made with her, Dale.

31:35.930 --> 31:37.130
Tell me about the shipments.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.630
They would take them on Wednesdays.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.830
That was the hot day. Always Wednesday.

31:43.430 --> 31:44.930
And Celia was not my fault.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.330
She should've never been there.

31:46.930 --> 31:47.530
And why is that?

31:48.730 --> 31:49.830
'Cause Wednesday's her day off.

31:54.230 --> 31:54.830
You look upset.

31:55.630 --> 31:56.130
Celia...

31:56.730 --> 31:58.630
why were you at the Livingstons'
on your day off?

31:59.230 --> 32:00.630
To be near Mr. Livingston.

32:00.730 --> 32:01.430
For what reason?

32:02.730 --> 32:03.630
Not the way you think.

32:05.630 --> 32:06.730
Celia...

32:08.030 --> 32:10.230
I can't help you unless you
tell me the whole story.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.430
Well, Immigration asked me to
listen to his phone calls.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.330
Something about that they can't get taps on him,

32:19.530 --> 32:23.630
and if I would listen to who he speaks to,
it would be something a good citizen would do.

32:23.930 --> 32:25.730
Immigration asked you to do this?

32:25.830 --> 32:26.730
I am a good citizen.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.330
Am I in trouble?

32:29.830 --> 32:32.230
No, you're not in trouble, but somebody is.

32:36.930 --> 32:38.030
Agent Maxwell.

32:39.530 --> 32:41.230
You've put this girl in extreme danger.

32:41.630 --> 32:44.230
Mala Noche is a dangerous threat.
We had to use a CI.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.630
She was raped and assaulted.

32:46.830 --> 32:50.030
We've been trying to get the Noches
on smuggling grenades into Florida for months.

32:50.430 --> 32:52.530
We know Diablo sets up
the infrastructure for this.

32:52.830 --> 32:54.830
You don't have enough to get
a warrant on Livingston, do you?

32:55.130 --> 32:56.130
Right.

32:56.730 --> 32:58.330
We thought if Ms. Gonzalez heard something,

32:58.430 --> 33:00.530
then we could get one,
then bring the Mala Noches down.

33:01.030 --> 33:04.830
We believe Diablo is the linchpin to
breaking up the gangs in the Southern states.

33:04.930 --> 33:06.430
You don't even know his real name, do you?

33:07.630 --> 33:08.330
Or where he is.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.730
We're depending on you for that.

33:13.730 --> 33:14.930
I think I hear your elevator.

33:22.930 --> 33:24.430
Valera, glad you're back.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.130
Glad my casework checked out, Lieutenant.

33:27.130 --> 33:27.730
What'd we get?

33:28.330 --> 33:30.930
CODIS found no match on the rape
evidence we got from the housekeeper.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.530
So my suspect is ruled out.

33:38.030 --> 33:41.830
Now, Valera, rape has the highest rate
of recidivism, doesn't it?

33:42.230 --> 33:43.330
Hard habit to break.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.330
Yes, it is.

33:46.830 --> 33:47.530
Lieutenant...

33:49.430 --> 33:51.530
Thinking your suspect's in my unsolveds?

33:51.830 --> 33:54.030
I am. Would you do me a favor and run that?

33:55.030 --> 33:57.130
Male fraction from your vic's sheets--
how far back you want me to go?

33:57.430 --> 33:58.930
As far as your grant will allow.

33:59.430 --> 34:00.430
Yeah,that will take a while.

34:00.930 --> 34:02.330
Yes, well, we better get started, then.

34:18.630 --> 34:19.030
Horatio.

34:20.429 --> 34:21.830
Stetler. It's been a while.

34:22.429 --> 34:24.429
I took some time off, did some traveling.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.030
Time away's a good thing, isn't it?

34:27.830 --> 34:29.730
I spent most of my time in New York.

34:32.130 --> 34:32.830
The Big Apple.

34:33.929 --> 34:35.130
I met some people who know you.

34:37.630 --> 34:39.230
Well, Rick, I know a lot of people up there.

34:41.730 --> 34:42.630
And a lot of people know you.

34:53.030 --> 34:55.630
Your rapist's DNA matched
the semen from a rape a year ago.

34:56.230 --> 34:57.030
Did you get a name?

34:57.530 --> 35:02.230
Guy named Benito Galian, a.k.a...
Diablo.

35:02.230 --> 35:02.730
Yeah.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.630
Where did this take place?

35:05.430 --> 35:08.430
Assault occurred... at the victim's home.

35:09.130 --> 35:10.630
Recognize this place?

35:12.230 --> 35:13.230
Nice address.

35:16.830 --> 35:18.530
Those rape charges are false, aren't they?

35:20.230 --> 35:21.930
I was seeing Benito a year ago.

35:23.130 --> 35:25.230
Beginning of my "bad boy" phase.

35:26.430 --> 35:28.330
My dad walked in on us while we were...

35:29.730 --> 35:30.130
You knowбн

35:30.330 --> 35:31.630
Yes, and you cried rape,

35:32.130 --> 35:33.330
but then dropped the charges.

35:35.930 --> 35:39.130
I want to know where the Mala Noche is right now,
and I don't want you to lie to me.

35:39.430 --> 35:40.030
I don't know.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.830
Diablo was supposed to send for me
after some big meeting.

35:44.230 --> 35:45.530
Did he call it a universal?

35:46.830 --> 35:48.030
Michelle, was it a universal?

35:48.730 --> 35:50.630
I don't know. He just said it was a big meeting.

35:57.430 --> 35:57.830
Frank.

35:58.130 --> 35:58.830
Yes?

35:59.330 --> 36:01.430
The Mala Noche have called for a universal, Frank.

36:01.630 --> 36:04.130
All the leaders are gonna confab in one spot.
Any idea where?

36:01.230 --> 36:04.930
That's where you come in.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.630
I'll put the word out and call the gang unit.
Do that. Mr. Wolfe.

36:08.330 --> 36:09.830
Sniper rounds are taking us nowhere.

36:10.030 --> 36:11.730
Okay, I need you to work on something else.

36:11.830 --> 36:12.130
Yeah, sure.

36:12.330 --> 36:13.530
The girlfriend, the reporter.

36:14.430 --> 36:15.630
Well, she's not really a friend anymore.

36:16.630 --> 36:17.530
We need her help.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.530
Thought you never wanted to see me again.

36:31.930 --> 36:33.530
Uh, I might've been a little harsh.

36:34.530 --> 36:35.430
Think we could start over?

36:36.530 --> 36:39.230
Journalists aren't the only
users in this business.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.030
Okay, I need your recording equipment.

36:42.630 --> 36:43.530
So you can break it again?

36:43.830 --> 36:45.630
That long-range mic--
that could help our manhunt.

36:46.130 --> 36:47.130
Ah, the parabolic.

36:47.930 --> 36:49.730
Just want to see what you picked up
out at the sniper attack.

36:50.030 --> 36:51.030
What sniper attack?

36:51.430 --> 36:52.130
You have a scanner.

36:53.530 --> 36:55.130
You were there somewhere.
You know exactly what attack.

37:08.330 --> 37:09.730
The clarity on this thing is amazing.

37:10.130 --> 37:13.830
The snipers were up on the tree lines,
let's focus on distant voices.

37:17.430 --> 37:18.630
News crew must have heard something.

37:22.830 --> 37:26.430
That's a voice. I think.
But I don't know what it's saying.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.230
It's Spanish.Play it back.

37:34.230 --> 37:35.630
Shut up and keep shooting.

37:39.730 --> 37:41.830
We don't leave now, we won't make the pier.

37:42.330 --> 37:44.130
Yeah, Horatio Caine. Get me SWAT.

38:29.930 --> 38:30.830
Looks like our .308.

38:31.730 --> 38:33.430
Matching the rounds found on the ridge.

38:33.730 --> 38:34.630
Where's Diablo?

38:34.930 --> 38:35.530
o hablo Ingles.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.230
You better learn to fast,ese.

38:37.530 --> 38:38.230
Where's Diablo?

38:39.330 --> 38:41.330
Diablo never showed, had to see some chica.

38:41.530 --> 38:44.330
He's in for a surprise 'cause we got
his little rich girlfriend in custody.

38:45.930 --> 38:47.330
What are you smiling at?!

38:48.930 --> 38:50.330
That's not the woman he's after.

40:17.230 --> 40:17.930
Let's go. Get up.

40:21.030 --> 40:21.830
Get up.

40:29.730 --> 40:31.830
If I were you, I'd put that down.

40:38.830 --> 40:41.130
Diablo, do not advance.

40:45.430 --> 40:46.630
This is your last chance.

40:48.530 --> 40:49.730
Do not make me do this.

41:00.630 --> 41:01.430
You okay, Celia?

41:02.230 --> 41:02.630
Yes.

41:08.330 --> 41:09.530
Is it wrong to thank you?

41:10.430 --> 41:13.830
What matters now is he'll never hurt you again.

41:14.730 --> 41:16.530
Something tells me you've been here before.

41:18.030 --> 41:48.030
Ma'am... you have no idea.
