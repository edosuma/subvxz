00:00.950 --> 00:03.530
bad news...

00:03.540 --> 00:06.310
worse news...

00:06.320 --> 00:08.750
fake news.

00:09.430 --> 00:11.680
* but I've gotta think twice *

00:11.690 --> 00:14.240
* before I give my heart away  *

00:14.250 --> 00:18.700
* and I know all the games you
play because I play them,too *

00:18.710 --> 00:23.610
* oh,but I need some time off *

00:52.130 --> 00:54.380
what?

00:54.390 --> 00:57.580
I can't hear you!

01:01.130 --> 01:03.600
Watch out!

01:11.570 --> 01:14.520
I know I haven't been batting
with the vision interpretation,

01:14.530 --> 01:16.420
but is interpretation
even required here?

01:16.430 --> 01:18.410
So after one vision,you
think a plane's gonna crash?

01:18.420 --> 01:20.800
No,i know a plane is gonna crash.

01:20.810 --> 01:23.840
Come on.My dad saw a plane crash
in his vision,and guess what?

01:23.850 --> 01:25.670
A plane crashed.How is this different?

01:25.680 --> 01:27.900
You mean apart from the
ethereal woman dressed in white?

01:27.910 --> 01:29.960
Which sounds an awful
lot like the virgin mary,

01:29.970 --> 01:35.900
which some catholics consider to be a harbinger
of impending disaster like,say,a plane crash.

01:35.910 --> 01:37.730
I googled "disaster" and "women.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.060
" Had to wade through hundreds of
sites of sarah palin and britney spears.

01:40.070 --> 01:42.260
Replaced by technology.Well,it
wouldn't be the first.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.910
How do I prevent a plane crash?

01:43.920 --> 01:46.950
Well,it would help to know
whatlight it was,or the airline.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.350
You don't even know
what field it crashed in.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.890
And you really want to know why I'm
cheating on you with the internet?

01:52.900 --> 01:57.130
All right,fine.Why don't you go back online
and see what you can learn about this woman?

01:57.140 --> 01:59.930
They're so tiny and adorable.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.180
Daddy,where did you get these?

02:01.190 --> 02:02.590
They were yours.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.620
To be honest,I considered
throwing them away,

02:04.630 --> 02:07.040
but your mother wouldn't let me.

02:07.050 --> 02:13.580
They were her baby shoes and her
mother's,and now they're yours again.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.740
Me and matt.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.440
Who would've thought,right?

02:19.450 --> 02:21.010
The two of you...

02:21.020 --> 02:23.100
you're happy?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.630
We are.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.100
You know,I thought working together
again was gonna drive me nuts,

02:27.110 --> 02:32.930
but after seeing his little frat boy face all day long,can you
believe I actually really look forward to seeing it again at night?

02:32.940 --> 02:34.480
He's a lucky man.

02:34.490 --> 02:37.200
The truth is,I think I'm the lucky one.

02:37.210 --> 02:42.350
You know me.I'm always waiting
for the other shoe to drop.But...

02:42.360 --> 02:44.080
I don't know.

02:44.090 --> 02:48.100
This time,I don't think it's going to.

02:49.310 --> 02:51.910
Are you okay?

02:51.920 --> 02:55.120
I've been thinking about
your mother a lot lately.

02:55.130 --> 02:58.380
Believe it or not,I actually called her.

02:58.390 --> 03:01.130
You what?Way to bury the lead.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.990
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.130
It's possible she's been plagued by--by
someone calling repeatedly and then hanging up.

03:08.140 --> 03:08.870
DaD.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.940
The phone ringing always
seemed to be the interval

03:10.950 --> 03:16.130
where in my mind a genuine attempt at
reconciliation became a fool's errand.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.420
Maybe if you'd given her
the chance to answer...

03:19.430 --> 03:21.220
maybe you'd be surprised.

03:21.230 --> 03:25.570
That has been happening with more
and more frequency as I get older--

03:25.580 --> 03:29.420
eli,you,matt.

03:32.850 --> 03:38.790
When you talk to mom,tell
her I said thanks for these.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.110
tammy,can you get
these redlined by noon?

03:41.120 --> 03:44.350
Also aaron in research needs
the list of housing N.P.O.S,

03:44.360 --> 03:46.820
and I'm gonna need you to revise the
citations for the salma-hoyt brief.

03:46.830 --> 03:50.650
The blue book on them's a disaster.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.050
You just gave that woman six additional
hours of work without even a touch of guilt.

03:57.060 --> 03:58.010
That's very impressive.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.350
Don't you have a quadriplegic to sue

04:00.360 --> 04:03.190
or an endangered species to take
off the endangered species list?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.520
Both sound fun,but I'm busy
handling the chaykin litigation.

04:06.530 --> 04:09.200
In fact,I could use a second chair.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.310
Be aot of long
days,weekends,maybe some travel.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.450
Posner told me to pick my own
team,and frankly I thought--

04:14.460 --> 04:19.620
you'd rather spend 15 hours in a
conference room with me than tommy woo?

04:19.630 --> 04:22.700
Okay,see,now that would have come
off as sexist if I has said it.

04:22.710 --> 04:28.080
I'm flattered,but representing monolithic,
monopolizing corporations
isn't really in my wheelhouse.

04:28.090 --> 04:30.740
After the ass you kicked
with bay west media?

04:30.750 --> 04:31.880
Wheelhouse is being renovated.

04:31.890 --> 04:33.150
I really can'T.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.320
Look,you're sadly mistaken if you
think I'm gonna take no for an answer.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.630
How about an "I'll think about it"?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.360
Best and final offer.

04:40.370 --> 04:43.290
Guess that'll have to do.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.430
do you really care who gets the
beatles collection if we divorce?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.380
Okay,first of all,I built that collection,so
it's mine no matter what.You can write that dowN.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.750
I helped you build that collection.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.070
I'm sure we can calculate a way
that both you get your share of--

04:54.080 --> 04:58.050
okay,look,I'm sorry.Buying me a cd for my
birthday does not constitute building a collection.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.040
Well,giving me a ring
and saying,"why not?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.880
" Doesn't constitute an engagement.

05:01.890 --> 05:02.630
Write that down.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.170
There's really no reason
to write anything down.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.140
You never complained before now.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.140
We're getting married,damn it.

05:07.150 --> 05:08.810
The proposal should have been special.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.600
It might help to remember
why we're all here.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.390
Because we'd rather fight about this
now,instead of when we're married.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.430
You want to be marri?You don't
avoid conflict.You embrace it,okay?

05:18.440 --> 05:22.020
Marriage is about fighting all
night and refusing to walk away.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.210
It's about doing whatever
it takes to stay together

05:24.220 --> 05:26.550
because you can't imagine being apart.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.700
I'm sure they know what
marriage is about,taylor.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.830
It's about spending 12 hours a
day together and wanting nothing

05:30.840 --> 05:35.440
more than to go home and spend
the next 12 hours together.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.250
So marry me.

05:40.260 --> 05:41.520
Is this part of the prenup process?

05:41.530 --> 05:44.280
Did you hear that,steven?That
was a proposal.

05:44.290 --> 05:50.080
All this last hour has shown is that you don't
love me enough to express it as well as a lawyer.

05:50.090 --> 05:51.680
A lawyer.

05:51.690 --> 05:54.630
Cheryl,uh...jeez.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.920
Cheryl!

05:55.930 --> 05:58.580
Hey,help me get her back in
here,and do not bill me for the time.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.900
Cheryl!

06:06.320 --> 06:09.280
hey,guys?

06:10.730 --> 06:12.360
What is so difficult about this,patti?

06:12.370 --> 06:13.400
Any connection,okay?

06:13.410 --> 06:16.820
Any coection between the woman in
a white dress and a plane crash.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.540
what?Are you crazy?

06:18.550 --> 06:22.830
Oh,okay.Uh,your continued enthusiasm
on this project is greatly appreciated.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.990
fine.

06:25.570 --> 06:26.660
Well?

06:26.670 --> 06:29.340
Uh,well,it's a
little,uh,technical,medically speaking,

06:29.350 --> 06:33.740
but I'll try and put it in terms that you
can understand-- brain good,personality bad.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.200
No joking.Everything was all right?

06:35.210 --> 06:37.760
I was standing over the technician's
shoulder the entire time.

06:37.770 --> 06:42.500
We looked at your M.R.I.We compared it to
last month's scan,and nothing has changed.

06:42.510 --> 06:45.040
You're still a tool.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.480
- damn it.
- Is it about me?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.170
You're not my only
patient,eli.What happened?

06:49.180 --> 06:50.140
Just got the page myself.

06:50.150 --> 06:53.520
The transplant was locked.My patient's
in prep.The donor's parents pulled out.

06:53.530 --> 06:54.660
They can't pull out.

06:54.670 --> 06:56.040
The coordinator got their consent.

06:56.050 --> 06:58.990
They revoked it.Something about
your patient's religious beliefs.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.390
what religious beliefs?

07:00.400 --> 07:03.950
Exactly.The patient's an atheist,apparently,and
the donors' parents are so very not.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.270
They balked at having their
daughter's heart given to a heathen.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.630
How do they even know who's getting it?

07:07.640 --> 07:10.330
It was an accident.Brand-new nurse
got caught up in the oprah of it all.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.040
I've already killed her.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.730
That doesn't solve the
problem,though,does it?

07:12.740 --> 07:14.320
How long is the heart still viable for?

07:14.330 --> 07:17.620
The would-be donor's in a persistent
vegetative state,so a while.

07:17.630 --> 07:18.740
Let's go.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.490
And where are we going,exactly?

07:20.500 --> 07:23.590
Uh,your patient,hospital
administration,risk management department

07:23.600 --> 07:26.500
and the donor's parents,but
not necessarily in that order.

07:26.510 --> 07:29.060
Not every problem can be
solved by suing somebody,eli.

07:29.070 --> 07:32.070
I got a law degree that says different.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.060
she's in here.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.050
She?

08:00.800 --> 08:04.910
No,no,no.Lawyers can be very helpful
when it comes to heart transplants.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.190
You hear the one about the guy that chose to get a
75-year-old lawyer's heart over an 18-year-old track star's?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.820
He wanted a heart that
had never been used.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.030
Yeah,you heard it.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.100
Yeah,yeah,all we do around
here is tell her jokes.

08:15.110 --> 08:17.330
It's--you know,laughter
really is the best medicine.

08:17.340 --> 08:21.070
I guess I'm just not sure how a
lawyer can help me get a heart.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.880
Well,it sounds like a matter of persuading
the would-be donor's parents-- uh,the rlisles.

08:24.890 --> 08:29.230
Yeah,to change their mind and restore
their original consent for the transplant.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.660
Good luck with that.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.690
They seemed pretty...

08:32.700 --> 08:34.250
adamant when they left my room.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.500
They have a problem with
your religious beliefs?

08:36.510 --> 08:39.490
Mainly that I don't seem to have them.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.610
They came in here and asked
me to join them in a prayer.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.020
And you passed?

08:45.030 --> 08:48.730
I'm kind of devoutly atheist,if
such a thing is possible.

08:48.740 --> 08:52.820
You didn't have to tell
the carlisles that,diane.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.680
A drunk driver turned their
daughter into a vegetable,dr.Stone.

08:57.690 --> 09:02.440
I'm not taking a piece of her under
false pretenses just to save my own life.

09:02.450 --> 09:05.680
One doesn't have to believe in
god to feel that kind of guilt.

09:05.690 --> 09:11.290
maybe not,but just because you're an atheist,that
doesn't mean you don't deserve to live.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.380
keith,hi.I-I need your
help with something.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.340
We're asking you to reconsider.

09:16.350 --> 09:18.460
There's nothing to
reconsider,mr.Bennett.

09:18.470 --> 09:22.070
We can't give our daughter's heart to
someone who doesn't share her beliefs.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.530
We can't save someone who
doesn't want to be saved.

09:24.540 --> 09:26.000
I think if you
knew diane better--

09:26.010 --> 09:27.850
we know she doesn't believe in god.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.600
We know she hasn't accepted jesus as
her savior.We know she's going to hell.

09:30.610 --> 09:35.220
Mr.Carlisle,with all due
respect,you don't know that.

09:35.230 --> 09:39.630
All we're asking for here is for
you to follow your original impulse

09:39.640 --> 09:40.900
and consent to the transplant.

09:40.910 --> 09:45.090
We can't do that,and I realize this must
be hard for you gentlemen to understand.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.960
Well,I have something of a learning
disability when it comes to discrimination.

09:47.970 --> 09:48.510
Excuse me?

09:48.520 --> 09:52.480
You want to withhold your daughter's heart because
diane doesn't share her beliefs--your beliefs.

09:52.490 --> 09:55.420
And because she doesn't,she's gonna
spend the rest of eternity in hell,

09:55.430 --> 09:56.780
and so would *****

09:56.790 --> 09:58.590
****t know that.

09:58.600 --> 10:04.010
That's the difference
between fact and faith.

10:05.580 --> 10:08.740
I'm sorry.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.870
So I caught up with cheryl,convinced
her to give steve another shot,

10:13.880 --> 10:15.620
and what the hell was that?

10:15.630 --> 10:17.160
And we're talking about it.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.410
Yes,we're talkin' about it.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.390
You asked me to marry you.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.790
Last month you asked me to marry you.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.490
This was different.This
was like A...not kidding.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.810
- There was a whole speech.
- I know.

10:27.820 --> 10:32.120
It's just that I was listening to our clients
prenegotiate every single thing in their marriage,

10:32.130 --> 10:36.800
and I thought maybe I
should take my own advice.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.740
Everything that we've been
through together this year--

10:38.750 --> 10:41.840
the baby,the genetics thing...

10:41.850 --> 10:46.820
maybe we should just marry each
other and stop wasting time.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.490
You're not gonna get down
on one knee or anything?

10:49.500 --> 10:53.960
Because when we tell
this story,and we will...

10:53.970 --> 10:57.960
I want to be the one proposing.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.170
Taylor,will you marry me?

11:02.180 --> 11:06.420
I asked you first.Come on.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.230
any judge is gonna take one
look at those grieving parents

11:10.240 --> 11:11.940
and hold us in contempt
for harassing them

11:11.950 --> 11:13.920
really hoping you have a
better strategy than that.

11:13.930 --> 11:16.210
Look,I'm gonna stay here,work
the transplant coordinator.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.760
The alternative is convincing
a judge to order two parents

11:18.770 --> 11:22.590
to send part of their
daughter to burn in hell.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.020
diane?

12:08.890 --> 12:12.110
Did a cold chill run up my spine?

12:12.120 --> 12:13.740
I'm not gonna lie to you.It did.

12:13.750 --> 12:19.280
So it is with both terror and joy that I
announce the engagement of my beloved daughter

12:19.290 --> 12:22.930
to mr.Matthew dowd.

12:24.630 --> 12:25.710
hey,what's going on?

12:25.720 --> 12:29.620
Taylor got her second proposal
from a lawyer at this firm.

12:29.630 --> 12:32.580
To make the walk down the hallway
to ask the father's permission?

12:32.590 --> 12:37.410
At any rate,my lack of forewarning
explains my lack of an engagement present.

12:37.420 --> 12:41.020
However,that isn't to say that
I don't have something to give.

12:41.030 --> 12:43.670
Due to financial constraints,the
firm's christmas gifts

12:43.680 --> 12:47.190
were placed on back order until now.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.400
Ladies?

12:51.410 --> 12:53.410
Given that the holiday
season has passed,

12:53.420 --> 12:58.880
let us simply call them
engagement presents for everyone.

13:08.170 --> 13:09.860
Maybe I haven't made myself clear.

13:09.870 --> 13:13.260
I need to speak to the head of
the T.S.A for all of north america.

13:13.270 --> 13:17.820
That's every airport.I need to speak
with someone who can ground flights.

13:18.170 --> 13:20.800
unbelievable.It's like they get paid
extra every time they put you on hold.

13:20.810 --> 13:23.720
You should consider yourself lucky
that they only put you on hold.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.530
- Eli,this is cr--  
- hello?

13:25.540 --> 13:27.090
This is the complaint hotline?

13:27.100 --> 13:28.300
You want a complaint?

13:28.310 --> 13:29.810
An airplane is gonna
fall out of the sky,

13:29.820 --> 13:32.220
and no one in your office
seems to want to hear about it.

13:32.230 --> 13:33.660
Yes,I'll hold.

13:33.670 --> 13:37.110
Did you get that list yet-- every employee
that's booked air travel in the next 24 hours?

13:37.120 --> 13:37.810
No.

13:37.820 --> 13:41.100
I'm not gonna go snooping in
employees' personal business.

13:41.110 --> 13:43.540
Are you kidding me?That's,like,a
second career for you.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.380
Come on.People's lives
are on the line here!

13:45.390 --> 13:46.920
- yes,sir.How may I help you?
- Yes,hello,yes.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.570
My name is eli stone.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.460
I'm an attorney for the north
american audubon society.

13:51.470 --> 13:55.470
I'm calling to alert you to a massive
early migration of canadian geese.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.900
Our estimates-- can you believe
it?They put me on hold again!

13:57.910 --> 14:01.750
no,I did.I found your airplane.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.410
What you doing?

14:08.420 --> 14:12.310
Well,I put my papers
in this device here,

14:12.320 --> 14:16.260
and it enables me to transport them
from the office to other venues.

14:16.270 --> 14:19.320
Including colorado,right?

14:19.330 --> 14:20.160
You booked a flight?

14:20.170 --> 14:22.620
I'm going to see taylor's
mother in person--

14:22.630 --> 14:24.350
where I can't hang up a phone.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.380
That's really wonderful.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.880
You can't go-- at
least,not today.

14:27.890 --> 14:30.380
Probably not for a week,just to be safe.

14:30.390 --> 14:32.590
I have to go today.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.090
If I don't,I'm afraid I never will.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.610
Well,you not getting there--
at least in one piece--

14:36.620 --> 14:39.690
this is kind of what
I'm concerned about.

14:40.190 --> 14:42.220
Okay.

14:42.660 --> 14:45.170
What is going on here?

14:45.900 --> 14:47.900
I know that you and i have A...

14:47.910 --> 14:53.030
a don't ask,don't tell policy
whent comes to this,but...

14:53.730 --> 14:56.050
my "aneurysm moments"...

14:56.060 --> 14:58.090
they're visions,and they guide me.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.630
I believe that they're sent
to me by a higher power,

15:00.640 --> 15:05.950
and I received one which has
you dying in a plane crash.

15:09.060 --> 15:12.160
It would be really great if you
could say something right now.

15:12.170 --> 15:15.330
ElI,I'm aware of your beliefs,

15:15.340 --> 15:19.420
just as I'm aware that you believe
you saved my life earlier this year.

15:19.430 --> 15:21.700
Sir-- the reason I don't
ask and you don't tell is

15:21.710 --> 15:25.050
because I think we both
instinctively know that

15:25.060 --> 15:30.400
having this conversation would be
detrimental to our relationship.

15:30.410 --> 15:31.230
Why?

15:31.240 --> 15:35.590
Because there's the risk that
you'll feel that my not believing you

15:35.600 --> 15:40.600
cod be confused with
not believing in you.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.430
So after what happened
in the bank,you don't--

15:44.440 --> 15:47.930
you convinced search and
rescue consider the possibility

15:47.940 --> 15:51.620
that I took the stairs instead of the
elevator-- a hunch that proved correct

15:51.630 --> 15:53.480
but did not prove the existence of god.

15:53.490 --> 15:55.060
So you think I'm crazy?

15:55.070 --> 15:57.830
No more than anyone who believes
the earth was created in six days

15:57.840 --> 16:02.430
or that a carpenter once
turned water into wine.

16:02.440 --> 16:08.090
I just choose not to live my
life according to those beliefs.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.370
And if that ends your life?

16:10.380 --> 16:16.070
Then it does,and you can console
yourself with knowing you were right.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.300
But I won't be moved on this,eli.

16:23.140 --> 16:26.050
It's a rare,life-threatening
condition called atrial myxoma.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.600
Diane rundlet's heart is
literally splitting in two.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.460
The respondents' daughter's
heart is her only hope.

16:30.470 --> 16:32.610
And it would all be
extremely tear-jerking

16:32.620 --> 16:35.740
except for the fact that you are
asking the court to order the carlisles

16:35.750 --> 16:37.860
to give a piece of their
daughter to a total stranger.

16:37.870 --> 16:41.560
No,we are asking the court to order the
carlisles to honor their original consent.

16:41.570 --> 16:44.690
By forcing them to give a piece of
their daughter to a total stranger.

16:44.700 --> 16:48.990
Slow down.I can't order the carlisles to
give their consent without a legal basis.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.410
How does promissory estoppel sound?

16:50.420 --> 16:52.520
- Archaic.
- The law doesn't come with an expiration date.

16:52.530 --> 16:55.240
Enough.I'm taking the
matter under advisement.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.740
Your honor,my client's daughter
is lying in a hospital room--

16:57.750 --> 16:59.680
and so ims.Rundlet.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.400
The clock's ticking for everybody.

17:01.410 --> 17:03.360
I'll deliver my ruling as soon as I can,

17:03.370 --> 17:09.940
but you should encourage your client to urge
her doctor to keep looking for alternatives.

17:21.849 --> 17:23.609
Maui?

17:23.619 --> 17:24.910
Tomorrow?

17:24.920 --> 17:26.960
We just got engaged six hours ago.

17:26.970 --> 17:28.950
How did you manage to
already plan our elopement?

17:28.960 --> 17:33.580
An effective assistant combined with an
irrational fear of you changing your mind.

17:33.590 --> 17:36.150
Matt.Did I seem like I was on the fence?

17:36.160 --> 17:38.450
I said it was irrational.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.740
First class?You went all-out.

17:40.750 --> 17:45.150
Of course.Besides,would
that fit in coach?

17:45.160 --> 17:48.110
Maybe i will change my mind.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.110
come here.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.970
Oh,it's the happy couple.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.940
Cutting out of work early to celebrate?

18:00.950 --> 18:03.400
No.To elope.

18:03.410 --> 18:07.160
No!That's gr--uh,just-- before
he can back out.That's smart.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.440
She's already preggers with my
baby.There's no backing out--

18:09.450 --> 18:10.690
not that I've thought about it.

18:10.700 --> 18:11.580
Well,congratulations.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.250
We'll send you a postcard from hawaii.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.480
Wait,no,you can't!Wait.You
can't,uh,you can't get on a plane.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.570
Don't worry.That's what the
two first-class tickets are for.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.700
- You don't understand.
- Actually,I do.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.060
You had a vision of a plane crashing.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.910
My father told me all about it
after he landed safely in colorado.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.190
You had a vision of a plane going down?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.590
Like the stock market.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.490
Y-you've seen my visions come true.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.380
Some of them.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.870
The earthquake,your dad in the bank,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.040
and every time you have to
be convinced all over again.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.500
There's a difference between
believing that miracles happen

18:40.510 --> 18:44.460
and believing that everything you
say is informed by the miraculous.

18:44.470 --> 18:45.780
I love that you care.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.070
We'll bring you back
some macadamia nuts.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.030
But...

18:50.640 --> 18:52.620
right in there.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.950
What can I do for you,mister,uh...

18:54.960 --> 18:56.590
you can call me todd.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.580
- Todd.
- Thanks.

18:58.590 --> 18:59.930
I appreciate you taking the time.

18:59.940 --> 19:03.300
I know you're,uh,really busy with
the diane rundlet case right now.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.850
You know about that?

19:04.860 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.I was,um...

19:07.010 --> 19:10.070
I was emma carlisle's boyfriend.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.730
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:11.740 --> 19:15.380
We broke up about a month
ago,but we stayed close.

19:16.430 --> 19:20.370
After,uh,the accident,we had a bunch of
candlelight vigils on campus,you know.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.800
Emma would've hated
them,but,uh,at the last one,

19:22.810 --> 19:26.920
her roommate told me about what was going on
with her parents and,uh,her heart and everything,

19:26.930 --> 19:30.430
so I got on a bus to come down
here and tell you in person.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.510
Tell me what?

19:31.520 --> 19:33.950
Emma would've wanted that
lady to have her heart.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.910
She wouldn't care if she
believed in god or not.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.550
Look,I'm sorry to put it so bluntly,but
the opinion of emma's ex-boyfriend

19:39.560 --> 19:42.100
is not gonna sway the judge,not when
she's got two living parents who--.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.090
Emma left the church six months ago.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.690
I mean,at's kind of why we broke up.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.010
What happened?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.970
I don't know.I mean,I still
don't quite understand it.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.940
I used to ask her that all the
time,but the best she could tell me

19:51.950 --> 19:55.320
was it was like being born
again except in reverse.

19:55.330 --> 19:56.900
So are you
saying-- no,no.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.790
I'm--I'm not
saying it.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.060
She said it.

20:00.070 --> 20:03.300
She was an atheist.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.950
her parents don't know.

20:07.960 --> 20:14.260
she was biologically incapable of
disappointing anybody,especially them.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.420
What's wrong?

20:15.430 --> 20:17.260
Your testimony--
it's--it's hearsay.

20:17.270 --> 20:18.070
It's inadmissible.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.890
At college,I'm prelaw.

20:22.850 --> 20:26.320
I wouldn't have wasted
your time with hearsay.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.630
Okay,clearly the concept of
elopement was invented by a man.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.600
No bride would ever leave
this little time for packing.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.240
Have you seen my flip-flops?

20:37.250 --> 20:39.520
And why aren't you
packing?We're not married yet.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.440
I don't have to pack for you.

20:42.780 --> 20:44.480
Listen,uh...

20:44.490 --> 20:45.760
I've been thinkin'.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.720
No,you haven'T.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.100
I don't think we should do this.

20:49.110 --> 20:50.110
What?

20:50.120 --> 20:54.050
I don't mean get married.I
don't even mean elope.I mean...

20:54.060 --> 20:56.350
maybe we shouldn't do the flying part.

20:56.360 --> 21:01.170
As much as it kills me to say this,cause
I had big plans for you and a coconut bra--

21:01.180 --> 21:02.880
what if eli's right?

21:02.890 --> 21:05.030
You gotta be kidding
me.You actually believe him?

21:05.040 --> 21:06.050
"Believe" is a strong word.

21:06.060 --> 21:08.320
You're the last person to put
stock in anything eli's ever said.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.570
You're like the president of
the "eli's full of crap" club.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.930
I know,and I'm 99% sure he's
full of crap this time,too.But--

21:13.940 --> 21:15.060
what's happened to you?

21:15.070 --> 21:16.890
Do I have to spell it out for you?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.670
Let's go out on that limb.

21:18.680 --> 21:22.510
You happened.You and our baby.

21:22.520 --> 21:27.350
It changes the odds a little,and
if there's only a 1% chance,

21:27.360 --> 21:34.620
1/2 of 1% chance elI's for
real,those are lousy odds.

21:34.630 --> 21:36.740
- absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

21:36.750 --> 21:40.160
You are not handing this girl's
e-mails over to the judge.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.280
Diane,I-I gotta ask you something.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.520
Um,do you want to die?

21:44.530 --> 21:45.300
Excuse me?

21:45.310 --> 21:47.680
It's just that every time that
you get the chance to do the thing

21:47.690 --> 21:49.210
that will get you a
heart,you go the other way.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.000
Just because I'm an atheist doesn't
mean I live without principles.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.700
Well,you can't live without a heart.

21:53.710 --> 21:54.990
So maybe it's time you
get off your high horse--

21:55.000 --> 21:58.370
maybe it's time you respecte
your client's wishes.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.450
If it helps,consider it a last request.

22:00.460 --> 22:01.460
Before I quit,you mean?

22:01.470 --> 22:04.300
I'm sorry if my conscience is
proving inconvenient for you.

22:04.310 --> 22:07.810
Okay,look,diane,I understand why you
didn't want to let the carlisles think

22:07.820 --> 22:11.040
that you're something you're not,but
these e-mails are a different thing.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.950
You're right.They're worse.

22:13.960 --> 22:19.110
The only thing the carlisles have left
of their daughter is their memory of her.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.290
What you want to do would destroy them.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.670
You won't be destroying
their memory of emma.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.820
She didn't do anything wrong.

22:24.830 --> 22:27.420
She just questioned her faith.

22:27.430 --> 22:33.100
You of all people should--should undervalue
how important that faith is to someone else?

22:33.110 --> 22:36.950
It's not about living with a heart.

22:36.960 --> 22:41.350
It's about whether I could
live with myself after.

22:41.830 --> 22:45.480
Not sure where that leaves us.

22:47.030 --> 22:52.990
I guess it leaves us with you
having to find another way to win.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.230
Stone,want to play a little game
called "guess where I'm not" right now?

22:59.240 --> 23:00.620
- Don't start.
- Wrong.

23:00.630 --> 23:05.710
No,the answer is on a beach drinking
out of pineapples,learning how to hula.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.140
You didn't get on the plane.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.400
Want to guess what else didn't happen?

23:09.410 --> 23:11.640
You can't be upset that
a plane didn't crash.

23:11.650 --> 23:14.110
No,just that I believed
you when you said it would.

23:14.120 --> 23:19.090
I'm taking taylor out to dinner tonight
and sending you the very large bill.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.340
the cause of the crash
has yet to be determined.

23:24.350 --> 23:29.780
Eyewitnesses report hearing a loud explosion
before pieces of the airplane fell from the sky.

23:29.790 --> 23:34.060
Officials estimate the crash
occurred just after 5:00 P.M.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.990
Tuesday as the plane exploded
above a field outside fresno.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.160
At this time,no official number
of casualties has been released...

23:41.170 --> 23:42.420
there are no survivors.

23:42.430 --> 23:43.730
You're out of your mind.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.680
The plane crashes today,nate.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.120
I know everything.I know--I know when and
I know where,everything except the flight.

23:49.130 --> 23:51.710
So why not just do the regular
acupuncture-- needle in the forehead,

23:51.720 --> 23:53.170
you know,like you did
with me and the crane.

23:53.180 --> 23:55.530
We did.Needle's been
in there all morning.

23:55.540 --> 23:58.450
You know,could drive a damn truck through
the hole in my forehead,but nothing.

23:58.460 --> 23:59.700
So we don't have a choice.

23:59.710 --> 24:00.890
We have to do the dark truth.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.580
Well,actually,we do.

24:02.590 --> 24:04.480
It's called,"letting
nature take its course.

24:04.490 --> 24:06.640
" Really?That sounds a lot
like letting people die.

24:06.650 --> 24:10.540
You are not responsible for every
lousy thing that happens,eli.

24:10.550 --> 24:14.030
I am if I could do something to stop it,and
I can do something to stop it if I know more,

24:14.040 --> 24:16.300
and the only way to know
more is to do the thing.

24:16.310 --> 24:18.590
"The thing"?Is that what
we're calling it now?

24:18.600 --> 24:21.690
The procedure that nearly killed
you,that gave you your second aneurysm?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.310
I thought you didn't
believe in the dark trh,natE.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.540
And I can't believe that you,of all
people,are going along with this!

24:26.550 --> 24:29.640
Your brother's stubborn,and
he makes a good point.

24:29.650 --> 24:31.500
We do it under controlled conditions.

24:31.510 --> 24:34.280
Frank does his thing and you monitor.

24:34.290 --> 24:37.690
And what am i monitoring,exactly--
whether or not you're losing your mind,

24:37.700 --> 24:39.590
'cause I don't need an E.K.G.For that.

24:39.600 --> 24:46.690
If the aneurysm or the aneurysms look
like they're gonna burst,u pull me out.

24:46.700 --> 24:47.710
And what if I can't?

24:47.720 --> 24:51.230
Someone I know is gonna
be on that plane,nate.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.790
If I could have prevented i.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.720
this is not just about me living.

24:56.730 --> 25:00.110
It's about whether I can
live with myself after.

25:00.120 --> 25:04.460
So basically what you're
asking me to do is sit back

25:04.470 --> 25:09.370
and watch someone i love die
so that you don't have to.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.870
I'm not gonna die,nate.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.890
I am not dad.

25:12.900 --> 25:13.840
It'll be different this time.

25:13.850 --> 25:14.650
How can you know that?

25:14.660 --> 25:19.190
Because dad was alone,and I've got you.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.860
okay,for the record,I think
this is a really bad idea.

25:25.870 --> 25:26.950
Nate!

25:26.960 --> 25:28.190
All right.

25:28.200 --> 25:32.220
Uh,your pulse is good-- a little
fast,which is to be expected,I guess.

25:32.230 --> 25:38.230
Um,E.E.G.Shows brain functions,so there's
something wrong with the machine,obviously.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.710
Okay,look.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.150
You better come back,okay?

25:41.160 --> 25:45.770
Otherwise I'm gonna have to come in
there after you and kick your ass.

25:55.200 --> 26:03.220
this is the final boarding call for
keystar flight 524,now boarding at gate 17.

26:05.570 --> 26:08.210
still no rhythm?

26:09.340 --> 26:11.060
Nothing.

26:11.070 --> 26:15.270
time of
death--4:52 P.M.

26:21.130 --> 26:23.100
please be seated.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.250
All right.

26:24.260 --> 26:28.950
I thought on this for as long as I can,but
both parties are running out of time here.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.620
Accordingly,I'm prepared to
rule in favor of the carlisles.

26:32.630 --> 26:34.140
Your honor,I'd like to call a witness.

26:34.150 --> 26:36.400
Uh,I've already made
my decision,mr.Stone.

26:36.410 --> 26:39.840
And I would like you to reconsider it,and
I know you won't do that without a reason.

26:39.850 --> 26:44.160
Mr.Stone-- the reason will be disclosed
by vivian carlisle's testimony.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.870
Mr.Stone-- please,your honor,once
you lower that gavel,that's it.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.560
You're holding diane
rundlet's one and only chance.

26:50.570 --> 26:52.400
It's all on you here.

26:52.410 --> 26:55.670
What's 15 more minutes?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.130
I'm sorry to put you through this.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.650
I know you're suffering more
than anyone should have to endure.

27:02.660 --> 27:04.520
Just ask your questions,mr.Stone.

27:04.530 --> 27:07.140
I only have one.

27:07.150 --> 27:10.900
Why did you revoke consent to give
your daughter's heart to diane?

27:10.910 --> 27:12.420
First,we've been over this.

27:12.430 --> 27:14.170
You know why.

27:14.180 --> 27:17.040
Second,it wasn't ever
our decision to make.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.190
It was emma'S.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.630
So you were making the decision that
you believe emma would have made.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.110
Yes.Emma's relationship
with god defined her life.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.700
She wouldn't want someone to have
her heart who doesn't even believe

27:26.710 --> 27:32.140
they had the potential
to be saved by god.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.620
But what if you're wrong about emma?

27:35.630 --> 27:36.950
- excuse me?
- Objection.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.050
Mr.Stone,don't speculate
as to emma's beliefs.

27:41.060 --> 27:44.530
I'm not speculating.

27:58.420 --> 28:04.590
this is a series of e-mails emma sent to her former
boyfriend todd riley over the last six months.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.020
Objection,your honor.It's hearsay.There's
no verification about anything.

28:07.030 --> 28:10.910
It's not hearsay if the witness is
unavailable and mr.Riley can authenticate them.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.010
You have letters from emma?

28:13.020 --> 28:14.180
what did she say,mr.Stone?

28:14.190 --> 28:15.510
Vivian,you don't have to respond.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.420
- We get the chance to review them--  
- no,I-I want to know.

28:20.890 --> 28:24.830
No,please,could you read it?

28:29.280 --> 28:33.040
Um,"todd,I went to the
school infirmary today,

28:33.050 --> 28:35.810
"and the nurse asked
me if I was a christian.

28:35.820 --> 28:38.340
"When I said yes,she
said she'd pray for me.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.040
"Really,what is that?

28:40.050 --> 28:43.360
"If I wasn't a christian,god
wouldn't want me to get better?

28:43.370 --> 28:46.060
"Something's changed.

28:46.070 --> 28:50.560
"I've been going to mass and saying
the words,"but here's what I know--

28:50.570 --> 28:52.640
they're just words.

28:52.650 --> 28:59.800
"I don't talk to him anymore,so I think--I
don't know-- "i think I'm done with church.

28:59.810 --> 29:05.500
"I've met too many people--
good people-- "who don't believe.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.460
And I think that's okay.

29:06.470 --> 29:09.990
" That's enough.What
you're doing is cruel.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.350
You're right.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.190
and,um,diane rundlet agrees with you.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.250
She didn't want me to read these.

29:19.260 --> 29:22.860
She told me that she would rather
lose her only chance to live

29:22.870 --> 29:27.110
than hurt you or the memory
that you have of your daughter.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.670
Now I know she calls
herself an atheist...

29:32.100 --> 29:36.410
but I've never heard of
anything more christian.

29:40.810 --> 29:41.690
now,patti,listen to me.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.730
- You sure you got everyone? No one in the fi is flying?
- I'm sure.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.650
- You got--you got-- you got donna in accounting? 
- Yes.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.570
You've got--you've got the guy
that fixes the coffee machine?

29:48.580 --> 29:49.420
His name's mike.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.490
Yeah,I know his name.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.230
- I got everyone.
- Okay.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.700
- Anything else? 
- No,no. That--that's great work,patti.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.120
- All right.
- That's great. Thank you.

30:00.580 --> 30:02.440
mr.Stone?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.710
What you did back there was repugnant.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.480
I know...

30:08.490 --> 30:12.220
and,uh,I'm sorry.

30:12.230 --> 30:17.480
I realize that I,uh,that I may
have crossed the line today.

30:22.260 --> 30:28.720
We've heard a few things about
you,that you...get messages?

30:28.730 --> 30:29.750
Most of us aren't so lucky.

30:29.760 --> 30:37.750
Most of us struggle every day to do what's right,to
honor our loved ones, to hold on to our faith,

30:37.790 --> 30:43.470
and we...we do it in the dark.

30:43.480 --> 30:51.990
What we heard today,those letters,we're gonna
choose to believe they were a message from emma,

30:52.000 --> 30:56.070
and we're gonna give our consent.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.230
thank you.

31:12.200 --> 31:17.530
You...disobeyed my direct inructns.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.040
Thank you.

31:19.050 --> 31:23.320
I specifically told you
not to use those e-mails.

31:23.330 --> 31:27.240
I told you I didn't want to live with
the carlisles' pain on my conscience.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.980
Well,I didn't want your death on mine.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.130
Yore fired.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.860
I'll send you my bill.

31:37.490 --> 31:45.890
I may not believe in the divine,but
after everything you've done for me...

31:45.900 --> 31:48.640
it's easy to see why people do.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.720
you have one new message.

32:01.730 --> 32:03.750
hi,eli,it's me.

32:03.760 --> 32:08.690
Um,I called to thank you,though now I'm--I'm
thinking I probably should be thanking patti

32:08.700 --> 32:12.490
because I bet it was her
idea to send me one of these.

32:12.500 --> 32:16.510
Still,your name is on it,so--
so thank you for the travel bag.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.970
Believe it or not,I'm
actually using it right now.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.040
I'm,uh,I'm heading off
to rome on business.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.050
So,um...bye.

32:30.790 --> 32:33.220
come on,maggie,pick up.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.980
My cell died.

32:35.990 --> 32:37.830
We'll get you a new one in italy.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.370
So you'll be incommunicado
for a couple days.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.950
Are you all right?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.730
Yeah. Yeah,I'm great.

32:51.020 --> 32:55.330
This is the final boarding
call for keystar flight 524,

32:55.340 --> 33:00.840
nonstop service to rome,now
boarding at gate 17.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.760
somebody
call 9-1-1!

33:33.500 --> 33:35.520
Hey,maggie.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.540
How you feeling?

33:36.550 --> 33:39.930
Uh,like I stopped the
express train with my head.

33:39.940 --> 33:41.120
I'm gonna go tell a
doctor,tell them you're awake.

33:41.130 --> 33:48.380
Wait,wait. Um,did what
I think happened happen?

33:48.980 --> 33:52.550
Your aneurysm burst,eli--
one of them,anyway.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.190
The doctors managed to stop the
bleeding with some kind of...coils?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.000
Endovascular coiling.

33:58.010 --> 33:59.690
You remember?

34:01.250 --> 34:03.790
Did you tell the paramedics
I had an aneurysm?

34:03.800 --> 34:08.080
Yeah. They thought
you had a heart attack.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.600
Lucky I was there.

34:10.610 --> 34:13.880
I was on my way to save you.

34:13.889 --> 34:17.060
Thanks for being late
to get on the plane.

34:18.989 --> 34:22.739
I did get on...with paul.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.100
But it didn't feel right.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.860
Maybe you're not the only one
who gets messages sometimes.

34:27.870 --> 34:30.170
Maybe.

34:31.060 --> 34:34.230
What happened with the plane?

34:34.239 --> 34:37.170
How many people died?

34:37.179 --> 34:39.270
None of them,eli.

34:39.280 --> 34:43.889
When I insisted on getting off,it was a
big deal because they were ready to go.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.440
The pilots had to start all over.

34:46.449 --> 34:49.280
They ran another safety
check,and this time they--

34:49.290 --> 34:50.600
they found what was
wrong with the plane.

34:50.610 --> 34:54.870
A problem with the engine--
fuel pump or something.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.070
They said that it would
have blown up in the air.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.020
So you saved everybody.

34:59.030 --> 35:03.520
I think in our way,we...we both did.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.250
What's going on here,eli?

35:08.260 --> 35:10.540
You mean with us?

35:14.330 --> 35:15.260
He's awake.

35:15.270 --> 35:18.150
Yeah. One aneurysm down,one to go.

35:18.190 --> 35:20.540
- You know,I owe you a big,fat I-told-you-so. 
- Yeah,I know.

35:20.550 --> 35:21.490
You could've wound up a vegetable,

35:21.530 --> 35:26.850
which,apart from kicking your I.Q.Up a
few points,wouldn't have been very good.

35:26.880 --> 35:27.980
You've got this one to thank.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.170
And I can't imagine the way she's
gonna hold that over my head.

35:30.210 --> 35:31.760
Oh,I've got a list.

35:31.770 --> 35:33.330
yeah.

35:34.980 --> 35:37.310
So,um,it's okay.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.900
The plane was grounded.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.370
Happy ending.

35:44.070 --> 35:46.060
What?

35:46.070 --> 35:47.920
It's diane.

35:47.930 --> 35:50.270
She went into surgery,and
we performed the transplant,

35:50.280 --> 35:53.600
and we were taking her
to the I.C.U.When...

35:55.210 --> 35:57.500
when she threw an embolism.

35:57.510 --> 35:59.660
No.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.470
I'm so sorry,eli.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.140
That's not fair.

36:03.150 --> 36:07.000
You did everything you could. You
could not have seen this coming.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.110
it's diane's surgeon.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.310
Her,uh,her mother's here.

36:17.320 --> 36:21.910
And,well,the heart's still viable.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.450
You gonna be okay?

36:32.460 --> 36:34.200
I don't know.

37:29.470 --> 37:32.920
it seems like such a
long time ago,doesn't it?

37:35.970 --> 37:37.670
It's beautiful.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.730
Is this heaven?

37:44.190 --> 37:45.560
Am I dead?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.310
It's the panch chuli peaks.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.510
I thought you'd recognize them.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.590
Could be heaven,though.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.320
Just as beautiful.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.440
Always wanted to see them.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.030
Are you my dad or...

38:02.050 --> 38:04.180
god?

38:04.960 --> 38:08.800
It's complicated.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.380
Don't push too hard against that.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.850
Well,I missed you.

38:18.890 --> 38:22.450
You've done well for
yourself,eli,both you and nate.

38:22.490 --> 38:24.490
No father could be prouder.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.280
And I know how hard it's been.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.690
I know you get
angry sometimes--

38:28.730 --> 38:30.690
like now.

38:32.430 --> 38:34.090
Diane wasn't supposed to die.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.950
Says you.

38:35.990 --> 38:37.720
You don't know.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.330
You're not god,eli.

38:39.360 --> 38:44.430
I broke my promise to diane,and I-I might've
destroyed that girl's family for nothing.

38:44.470 --> 38:49.370
Not for nothing. For grace.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.640
- Grace?
- Grace.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.850
- The--the person? 
- Grace. She's in san francisco.

38:52.900 --> 38:57.480
She was waiting for the right time to
reconnect with you,eli,and then she...

38:58.390 --> 39:00.760
Her heart gave out.

39:00.790 --> 39:06.670
She needed a transplant,and as it
turns out,there was a viable heart.

39:10.290 --> 39:13.570
It was for your soul mate.

39:13.970 --> 39:16.620
Mysterious ways,and yours
is not to reason why.

39:16.650 --> 39:21.350
W--yes,it
is.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.140
I am happy for grace.

39:24.170 --> 39:27.330
I'm happy,and I'm thankful.

39:27.370 --> 39:32.030
But if you or god or whatever,you
want me to keep doing this,

39:32.080 --> 39:41.250
it has to be my way,especially when people that
I love--people like maggie-- are on the line.

39:41.290 --> 39:44.890
And by the way,just cut that crap out.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.090
people wonder why god
gave man free will.

39:53.760 --> 39:58.270
and don't think I didn't notice how
you said you love maggie just now.

40:05.350 --> 40:07.790
Was this a test?

40:10.770 --> 40:13.620
Everything's a test.

40:13.650 --> 40:16.610
Life is a test.

40:16.650 --> 40:18.620
And you...

40:19.720 --> 40:24.920
you,my boy,you're passing
with flying colors.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.530
I couldn't be more proud.

40:28.560 --> 40:37.980
* Some kind of magic
happens late at night *

40:39.480 --> 40:44.300
* when the moon smiles down at me *

40:44.890 --> 40:48.890
* bathes me in its light *

40:50.170 --> 40:54.930
* I fell asleep beneath you *

40:56.110 --> 41:00.840
* in the tall blades of grass *

41:01.660 --> 41:07.160
* when I woke the world was new *

41:07.190 --> 41:11.500
* I never had to ask *

41:13.020 --> 41:16.670
* it's a brand new day *

41:16.720 --> 41:18.650
* the sun is shining *

41:18.680 --> 41:22.820
* it's a brand new day *

41:23.750 --> 41:32.580
* for the first time in such
a long, long time I know *

41:34.750 --> 41:38.140
* i'll be okay *
