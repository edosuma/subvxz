00:12.482 --> 00:14.758
- Hey, we could have
had coffee upstairs.

00:14.827 --> 00:17.655
Why did you want
to meet down here?

00:18.896 --> 00:21.620
- Today is my last day
at Millennial.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.862
- What?

00:22.931 --> 00:25.310
- I wrote a Dear John letter
to Charles,

00:25.379 --> 00:27.344
and I'm leaving.

00:28.482 --> 00:29.620
- Why?

00:29.689 --> 00:31.068
- I've been there a while,

00:31.137 --> 00:33.931
and it's time
for me to move on.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.241
I want a fresh start.

00:35.310 --> 00:36.758
- But where?
Where are you going?

00:36.827 --> 00:38.793
- I don't know.

00:38.862 --> 00:40.172
Liza, it's fine.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.827
I'm taking a leap,
and the net will appear.

00:42.896 --> 00:45.034
- Yeah, well, sometimes
the sidewalk appears first.

00:45.103 --> 00:48.517
Look, please, just take a beat,
think, talk it over with me.

00:48.586 --> 00:51.137
We can do, like,
pros and cons.

00:51.206 --> 00:53.413
- My mind is made up.

00:53.482 --> 00:54.896
- Well, what did
Charles say?

00:54.965 --> 00:56.310
- Nothing yet.

00:56.379 --> 00:58.034
I stopped by his office
on the way here,

00:58.103 --> 00:59.482
and I left a letter
on his desk.

00:59.551 --> 01:01.137
I don't want to be there
when he gets it.

01:03.103 --> 01:04.827
Are you crazy? Hey!

01:04.896 --> 01:07.103
Liza, wait!

01:11.448 --> 01:12.551
- Can I help you?

01:12.620 --> 01:14.448
- Hi, good morning.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.068
Oh, right.

01:17.137 --> 01:19.000
I left this for you.

01:19.068 --> 01:22.000
It's a--it's a letter...
for you.

01:22.068 --> 01:24.896
But you shouldn't read it
in the office

01:24.965 --> 01:28.310
because it's--
it's inappropriate...

01:28.379 --> 01:30.482
at work,
so I'm gonna take it back.

01:30.551 --> 01:32.482
- Now I really
want to read it.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.241
I won't report you
to HR.

01:34.310 --> 01:35.517
- No, it's just it's--

01:35.586 --> 01:36.862
It's really sexy stuff,

01:36.931 --> 01:39.206
and it's just, like, dirty,
so I, um....

01:39.275 --> 01:40.517
I wrote--
it's a limerick.

01:40.586 --> 01:42.275
I wrote you a limerick.
That's it.

01:42.344 --> 01:44.448
But it turns out that I'm not
very good at those, so...

01:44.517 --> 01:46.758
- Um, that's not
your handwriting.

01:49.241 --> 01:52.034
It's my resignation,
Charles.

01:52.103 --> 01:53.620
I'm leaving.
- No, she is not.

01:53.689 --> 01:55.000
She is thinking about leaving,

01:55.068 --> 01:56.689
but we're gonna sit down
and figure it out.

01:56.758 --> 01:58.620
- There's nothing
to figure out.

01:58.689 --> 02:01.379
I can't be editor
where I was publisher.

02:01.448 --> 02:02.862
I tried.
I can't.

02:02.931 --> 02:05.103
- Take two weeks.

02:05.172 --> 02:07.137
Take a leave.

02:07.206 --> 02:08.689
Let the dust settle.

02:08.758 --> 02:11.206
Please, you're
too important to us.

02:11.275 --> 02:12.586
- No, I'm sorry.

02:12.655 --> 02:16.620
There's nothing else to say...
except...

02:19.413 --> 02:20.862
Thank you, Charles,

02:20.931 --> 02:24.620
for finding me in the assistant
pool and promoting me

02:24.689 --> 02:29.379
and giving me all of these
incredible opportunities.

02:30.655 --> 02:33.068
But my time here
is over.

02:33.137 --> 02:35.827
So...

02:35.896 --> 02:38.482
Don't make it hard for me,
all right?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.034
Just read this.

02:43.310 --> 02:46.103
I meant every word.

03:02.931 --> 03:04.379
No, Liza, don't.

03:04.448 --> 03:06.448
This is not good-bye.
I'm gonna see you.

03:23.172 --> 03:24.482
- Done, done, and done.

03:24.551 --> 03:26.137
Oh, and I got
the Rome hotel upgrade.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.689
You now get a bidet
and an espresso machine

03:28.758 --> 03:29.931
right next to each other,
but still.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.344
- Oh, good,
we have a problem.

03:31.413 --> 03:33.344
- Yes, my maid of honor,
late again.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.551
Thank God
you deputized Lauren.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.068
You do know we're
four days out.

03:36.137 --> 03:37.827
- That's just it.
I just got a call from Redmond.

03:37.896 --> 03:39.551
We have a pitch on Friday.
That's the day before.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.724
- No, no, no, no.
That is not on my calendar.

03:42.793 --> 03:44.241
Oh, God, Kelsey
must have scheduled it

03:44.310 --> 03:45.517
without telling anyone.

03:45.586 --> 03:46.931
That's the third time
this week.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.655
She left dirty little bombs
everywhere.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.310
- Yeah, I mean, she kept
a lot of stuff in her head.

03:50.379 --> 03:52.206
I have no idea how this company
is running without her.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.413
- It's just not the same place.

03:53.482 --> 03:54.896
- Liza, please.

03:54.965 --> 03:57.068
She was not the heart and soul
of this company.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.103
We are happy for her.
We are happy for us.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.344
We are happy!

04:00.413 --> 04:01.896
- Yeah, absolutely,
uh, but, weirdly,

04:01.965 --> 04:03.413
both of your offices
are out of Kleenex.

04:03.482 --> 04:04.724
I'm just saying.

04:04.793 --> 04:06.310
- She keeps dodging
my calls too,

04:06.379 --> 04:09.206
just little texts saying
she's working on her game plan.

04:09.275 --> 04:11.482
I know she's coming
to the wedding, though.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.000
- And the spa the day before?

04:13.068 --> 04:16.137
- Kelsey's a no,
but Enzo's sisters are in,

04:16.206 --> 04:18.137
and they want it all
plus a moustache wax.

04:18.206 --> 04:20.275
- Yeah, curse
of the Mediterranean.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.448
- Oh, yeah, they have got
a Russian lady there,

04:22.517 --> 04:23.965
an actual Putin,

04:24.034 --> 04:25.448
with the finger strength
of my first girlfriend.

04:25.517 --> 04:27.379
She...
She will get it done.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.413
- Oh, it's Enzo,
the Uncle Joe meeting.

04:31.482 --> 04:32.965
- Uncle Joe, who's Uncle Joe?

04:33.034 --> 04:35.000
- How can you be so bad
at this maid of honor stuff?

04:35.068 --> 04:36.724
- You're a thousand years old.

04:36.793 --> 04:39.758
This can't be your first rodeo.
- Well...

04:49.517 --> 04:50.862
- Thank you for
meeting me here.

04:50.931 --> 04:52.689
- I gotta say,
I'm surprised.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.689
Thought I was public enemy
number one.

04:54.758 --> 04:57.310
- Well, you're a very smart
public enemy number one.

04:57.379 --> 05:00.965
I need your advice.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.620
I'm thinking of going
out on my own

05:03.689 --> 05:05.689
and starting my own
publishing company.

05:05.758 --> 05:07.758
I already have a few meetings
lined up this week,

05:07.827 --> 05:09.965
and I thought because
you and Charles

05:10.034 --> 05:11.758
already did it with
Mercury

05:11.827 --> 05:14.827
that I could just give you
my pitch and get some feedback.

05:14.896 --> 05:18.379
- Uh, I don't need
to hear the pitch.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.931
My feedback is,
don't do it.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.758
Look, you're the best editor
I've ever worked with,

05:22.827 --> 05:24.827
but talent only
gets you so far.

05:24.896 --> 05:27.586
Yeah, Mercury worked because
Charles came up with 800K

05:27.655 --> 05:30.068
to buy the Audrey Colbert book.

05:30.137 --> 05:32.724
It's cold out there
in the publishing world.

05:32.793 --> 05:34.344
Check your ego and come back.

05:34.413 --> 05:35.862
- With respect, my résumé

05:35.931 --> 05:38.068
looks a little different
than yours when you went out.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.551
I've started and run
my own imprint.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.344
I've been publisher.

05:42.413 --> 05:43.655
I can do this.

05:43.724 --> 05:45.793
- I know what you can do,
Kelsey,

05:45.862 --> 05:49.344
and I know what you can't.

05:49.413 --> 05:51.241
- What does that mean?

05:51.310 --> 05:52.931
- It means--
all right, look.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.724
You and I were doing
great together, really great,

05:55.793 --> 06:00.862
and then the thing happened and
you decide to punish me for it.

06:00.931 --> 06:03.068
- You're being punished?

06:03.137 --> 06:04.379
I lost my job.

06:04.448 --> 06:08.172
- No, you gave up your job
to save the company.

06:08.241 --> 06:10.793
You think what happened
was your worst moment.

06:10.862 --> 06:12.724
I thought you were awesome.

06:12.793 --> 06:14.896
I wanted to be there for you
to help you see that,

06:14.965 --> 06:17.103
but instead, you bailed.

06:18.758 --> 06:21.034
I--

06:21.103 --> 06:22.896
I can't think about
being in a relationship

06:22.965 --> 06:25.206
when I'm scrambling
for my next move.

06:25.275 --> 06:27.068
You were the same way.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.827
You have to feel good
about yourself to make room

06:29.896 --> 06:32.689
for other people,
and I'm not there.

06:32.758 --> 06:35.724
- I believe you, Kelsey.

06:35.793 --> 06:37.620
You know, I wish I didn't.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.655
You deserve to get
what you want.

06:39.724 --> 06:41.586
I just--I just wish
you wanted more,

06:41.655 --> 06:43.103
and if you do one day,

06:43.172 --> 06:45.000
if you want more than just
business advice from me,

06:45.068 --> 06:47.620
it's gonna have to be
your move, okay?

06:47.689 --> 06:49.310
You're gonna have
to reach out.

06:51.482 --> 06:53.724
Good luck with your pitches.

06:58.172 --> 06:59.620
- Ooh, you need this
more than I do.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.068
Come in.
Bad day?

07:01.137 --> 07:02.482
- Oh, the worst.

07:02.551 --> 07:04.517
I've been pitching
my new company all over town.

07:04.586 --> 07:08.310
All nos--well, not no,
but, "Oh, you poor thing."

07:08.379 --> 07:11.000
It's really hard to pitch to
people that have seen the video

07:11.068 --> 07:15.000
because their eyes all of
a sudden just start...drifting.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.689
- Mm, I get it.
It's hard for me too.

07:17.758 --> 07:18.965
How am I doing?

07:19.034 --> 07:20.344
Come.

07:20.413 --> 07:23.689
- You know, I'm afraid I
painted myself into a corner.

07:23.758 --> 07:25.517
I think Zane's right.

07:25.586 --> 07:28.000
I let my ego get in the way.

07:28.068 --> 07:31.379
- Well, I don't know where
I'd be without my ego,

07:31.448 --> 07:32.724
probably somewhere upstate

07:32.793 --> 07:35.586
crafting and smelling
of hot glue.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.896
Do you still believe
in yourself?

07:36.965 --> 07:38.724
- Yeah, I do, but it takes
more than that.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.344
I need one more believer.

07:40.413 --> 07:41.724
I need a believer with money.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.724
- You had a believer
with money,

07:43.793 --> 07:45.206
if I recall correctly.

07:45.275 --> 07:47.344
Look, you quit your job
to be a player,

07:47.413 --> 07:48.586
so be a player.

07:48.655 --> 07:49.827
I mean, sometimes you have

07:49.896 --> 07:51.103
to get in bed
with the devil.

07:51.172 --> 07:53.689
How do you think
I got this loft, hmm?

07:53.758 --> 07:55.862
Long story, no names.

07:57.827 --> 08:00.517
- Because I love books,
I always have,

08:00.586 --> 08:02.965
but that's not the only way
to tell a story now:

08:03.034 --> 08:04.896
audiobooks, podcast,

08:04.965 --> 08:07.172
digital delivery
of subscription content,

08:07.241 --> 08:10.758
serials like the way Dickens
used to publish, and TV.

08:10.827 --> 08:12.724
Yes, why not?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.827
It's all new ways
of crafting a book.

08:14.896 --> 08:17.206
Opening your mind,
filling your soul,

08:17.275 --> 08:20.551
that is what KLP Print
is all about...

08:20.620 --> 08:22.137
with your help.

08:22.965 --> 08:25.137
- I like it.

08:25.206 --> 08:30.241
KLP Print, that is the worst
name I've ever heard.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.379
In this day and age,
you need something short

08:32.448 --> 08:37.000
and easy to say
like Looli or Oobay.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.344
I mean, what the hell does
Google even mean?

08:42.517 --> 08:44.689
- I'm open to changes...

08:44.758 --> 08:46.172
with the right offer.

08:46.241 --> 08:51.310
- See this? This attitude,
down but not out?

08:51.379 --> 08:52.758
This is what I'm buying.

09:01.965 --> 09:03.310
- It's just not the same
without Kelsey.

09:03.379 --> 09:05.620
And all the wedding stuff
for Diana?

09:05.689 --> 09:07.206
I'm not drowning exactly,

09:07.275 --> 09:09.103
but I definitely
feel the water rising.

09:09.172 --> 09:11.172
- Sounds to me like
you need a vacation.

09:11.241 --> 09:13.310
- Oh, my God, this is
the absolute worst time.

09:13.379 --> 09:15.793
With Diana away on her
honeymoon next week? I--

09:15.862 --> 09:18.620
- Not now, this summer
when things calm down.

09:18.689 --> 09:21.482
I am taking the girls
to Scotland.

09:21.551 --> 09:23.793
You know, I thought that
they would want the beach,

09:23.862 --> 09:27.000
but Bianca heard about
a Harry Potter tour.

09:27.068 --> 09:31.034
Anyway, so there will be
hiking and golfing

09:31.103 --> 09:36.310
and a lot of time to drink
whiskey and learn spells

09:36.379 --> 09:42.068
and I was thinking maybe you
and Caitlin might want to join.

09:43.103 --> 09:45.068
- Wow, that's a lot
to think about.

09:45.137 --> 09:48.068
- Yeah, I think
it's time we all

09:48.137 --> 09:51.000
got to know each other
a little better.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.413
- I could talk
to Caitlin.

09:56.482 --> 09:58.827
I have to warn you, though:
if we leave the girls with her,

09:58.896 --> 10:00.655
she will charge
for babysitting.

10:00.724 --> 10:03.206
- I admire
her business instincts.

10:03.275 --> 10:06.620
- Charles, Liza.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.172
- Hello, Quinn.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.482
- Quinn.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.965
- Oh, I see you still
haven't forgiven me

10:12.034 --> 10:13.931
for yanking my money
out from under you.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.206
I had to.
It's politics.

10:16.275 --> 10:19.482
And my campaign is going
so much better now, so...

10:19.551 --> 10:20.620
Still friends?

10:20.689 --> 10:22.862
- Oh, as much as we ever were.

10:22.931 --> 10:25.310
- So funny,
running into you.

10:25.379 --> 10:28.827
This whole week has been
a real blast from the past.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.551
- How so?
- Let's just say that someone

10:30.620 --> 10:33.551
who used to work for you
or with you or next to you--

10:33.620 --> 10:35.793
I don't know, it's always
so confusing over there--

10:35.862 --> 10:37.620
is going into
business with me.

10:37.689 --> 10:39.034
Isn't life hilar?

10:39.103 --> 10:40.724
Anyway, my biggest
donor awaits.

10:40.793 --> 10:43.965
Watching him eat
is the hardest thing I do.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.862
Bye.

10:48.103 --> 10:51.275
- That couldn't be Kelsey
she's talking about.

10:51.344 --> 10:52.827
- She'd never team up
with Quinn.

10:57.517 --> 10:59.172
- But Quinn Tyler?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.793
Kelsey, she was nothing but
trouble for you at Millennial.

11:00.862 --> 11:02.724
- But she made me
publisher.

11:02.793 --> 11:03.931
No one else did.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.655
It's a step up, Liza.

11:05.724 --> 11:07.931
It's ownership, and I need
something that's mine.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.965
- Kelsey--
- I'm good with my decision.

11:11.034 --> 11:13.172
Can we talk about
something else?

11:13.241 --> 11:17.000
- You know whatever you do,
I'm on your side.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.551
- Speaking of sides,

11:18.620 --> 11:20.724
you're sitting on the bride's
with us tomorrow, right?

11:20.793 --> 11:22.206
- Yeah.

11:22.275 --> 11:25.517
I know that Charles is gonna
be there...and Zane

11:25.586 --> 11:28.068
but it's Diana's day.

11:28.137 --> 11:29.655
We're there
to celebrate her.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.068
- Good.

11:31.137 --> 11:32.482
At least for one day,

11:32.551 --> 11:35.724
I can pretend everything's
the way it used to be.

11:35.793 --> 11:37.034
Remember the way
it used to be?

11:37.103 --> 11:39.379
It wasn't so bad,
was it?

11:39.448 --> 11:40.931
- I know that you don't
want to ask about him,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.379
but Josh is doing fine.

11:44.448 --> 11:46.655
He'll be in Midtown
next week.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.896
- Wow, that's good.

11:48.965 --> 11:50.965
We, um, sort of had
a bad talk last week

11:51.034 --> 11:52.379
about me
seeing less of him.

11:52.448 --> 11:54.310
He didn't like that.
- No kidding.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.068
You're kind of the most
important woman in his life

11:56.137 --> 11:57.413
who isn't teething.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.827
- It's just I feel like,
for the both of us,

11:59.896 --> 12:01.896
it's time for a little space.

12:01.965 --> 12:04.379
- How's that working out
for you?

12:04.448 --> 12:09.034
- It's weird, but we have to
make choices in life.

12:09.103 --> 12:13.137
- To new horizons...
for both of us.

12:13.206 --> 12:15.034
No looking back.

12:19.551 --> 12:21.068
- Hey.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.241
Well, what do you think?

12:22.310 --> 12:23.724
Are we gonna be
ready for Monday?

12:23.793 --> 12:24.931
- Absolutely.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.034
I am so excited
about this.

12:27.103 --> 12:30.000
You are gonna be on every girl
in Manhattan.

12:30.068 --> 12:34.758
I am that market, and we
all wanna piece of you.

12:34.827 --> 12:36.896
- Huh.
- One of your pieces,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.793
I mean.
I keep saying piece.

12:38.862 --> 12:41.413
I don't even know why.

12:41.482 --> 12:43.827
Oh, can I look at yours?

12:43.896 --> 12:46.068
Your lookbook?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:46.137 --> 12:49.275
Uh, yeah, um, I was actually
thinking that we could

12:49.344 --> 12:51.551
stick to some of these
smaller, simpler designs.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.620
You know, that way I can get
everything done fairly--

12:54.689 --> 12:55.965
fairly quickly
in just one visit.

12:56.034 --> 12:57.827
- Absolutely,
maximize revenue.

12:57.896 --> 12:59.724
Get 'em in. Get 'em out.
Tat and scat.

12:59.793 --> 13:03.379
Shoot, is that
a better name than Inkburg?

13:03.448 --> 13:04.793
- Nope.

13:04.862 --> 13:06.206
- Okay, um...

13:06.275 --> 13:09.241
These are so good.
They're very elaborate.

13:09.310 --> 13:13.965
Um, could you do, like,
emojis or maybe like...

13:14.034 --> 13:15.689
Pikachu.

13:15.758 --> 13:18.137
Um, that's so good.

13:18.206 --> 13:21.517
- Yeah, yeah, it's like
time standing still.

13:21.586 --> 13:23.862
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

13:23.931 --> 13:27.241
It's like a moment
that lasts a lifetime.

13:27.310 --> 13:30.965
- Um, the point is,
it's aspirational.

13:31.034 --> 13:33.103
- Yeah.
- We can sell a ton.

13:33.172 --> 13:38.310
- Ah, you know, that one
is more of, like, a one-off.

13:38.379 --> 13:42.517
You know, like, it doesn't
really belong to me anymore.

13:42.586 --> 13:44.482
You know when you sell
a painting, it's like--

13:44.551 --> 13:47.379
it's not yours.
It's theirs, you know?

13:47.448 --> 13:49.689
Josh, I super like it, though.

13:49.758 --> 13:51.413
Can't you just ask
who you gave it to,

13:51.482 --> 13:53.551
and please don't say
you forgot who she is.

14:01.379 --> 14:02.586
- Hi!

14:02.655 --> 14:03.896
both: Mwah, mwah!

14:03.965 --> 14:05.862
- You're so beautiful.

14:05.931 --> 14:07.896
Ah, hi.

14:07.965 --> 14:10.206
Hi.
- Hey.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.241
- You go on in.
I have to wait for Diana.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.172
Oh, we're on the left.
Do you see Kelsey?

14:14.241 --> 14:16.000
- I can't believe
she's going with Quinn.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.137
- Oh, let's not
bring it up today.

14:18.206 --> 14:20.068
She wants something
she can own.

14:20.137 --> 14:22.655
She was pretty clear
about that.

14:22.724 --> 14:24.931
- She does, huh?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.103
- Oh, it's Enzo's mother.

14:26.172 --> 14:28.344
Hi, you look beautiful.

14:28.413 --> 14:30.517
It's such a happy day.
- Is it?

14:30.586 --> 14:35.482
I saw a crow flying
upside down on the way here.

14:35.551 --> 14:37.862
It's a bad omen.

14:37.931 --> 14:39.275
- Especially for the crow.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.172
- The bride has landed,
people.

14:41.241 --> 14:42.793
Bridal party, line up.

14:42.862 --> 14:44.793
- Okay.
- Shit's goin' down.

14:44.862 --> 14:47.000
- Yay!
- Great, you go up there.

14:47.068 --> 14:48.034
Good.
- Okay.

14:48.103 --> 14:49.448
You ladies, come here.

15:01.103 --> 15:03.517
- It's a beautiful church,
isn't it?

15:04.620 --> 15:05.931
- Hi, Charles.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.310
- If I were a praying man,

15:07.379 --> 15:10.241
I know what I would be
asking for right now:

15:10.310 --> 15:13.034
for you to come back home
to Millennial.

15:13.103 --> 15:14.517
- As flattered as I am,

15:14.586 --> 15:17.551
is this really the place
to be talking about it?

15:17.620 --> 15:22.689
- Isn't this where we bring our
problems and hope for answers?

15:22.758 --> 15:25.448
We miss you, Kelsey.

15:25.517 --> 15:27.206
We need you.

15:27.275 --> 15:30.689
Whatever you're being offered,
I can match that.

15:30.758 --> 15:32.586
- You can't.

15:32.655 --> 15:36.965
I want to work for myself
on something I own.

15:37.034 --> 15:39.034
- But that's Millennial.

15:39.103 --> 15:40.310
You built that
from the ground up.

15:40.379 --> 15:42.103
You own that.
- Not officially.

15:42.172 --> 15:43.620
You know what I mean.

15:43.689 --> 15:45.551
- So let's make it official.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.241
I'll give you a stake
in the company,

15:48.310 --> 15:52.103
enough of my shares
to get you a seat on the board.

15:53.655 --> 15:56.379
- That's a really nice thought,
but you can't do that.

15:56.448 --> 15:58.068
It's a family-held company.

15:58.137 --> 16:00.000
- And you're family,
Kelsey.

16:00.068 --> 16:02.241
I knew that the day
that you sacrificed

16:02.310 --> 16:04.379
everything that you
wanted to save us.

16:04.448 --> 16:08.034
If that isn't family,
then I don't know what is.

16:09.310 --> 16:11.000
- I don't know
what to say.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.689
- Don't--don't--don't
say anything right now.

16:13.758 --> 16:16.689
Take time.
Think.

16:16.758 --> 16:20.689
But I will be waiting, hoping,

16:20.758 --> 16:23.482
praying for your answer.

16:33.413 --> 16:37.103
- Diana, you look
so beautiful.

16:37.172 --> 16:38.206
- I'm ready.

16:38.275 --> 16:39.482
Enzo gave me this last night.

16:39.551 --> 16:41.482
It's my something new.

16:41.551 --> 16:43.172
- He said you helped him
pick it out?

16:43.241 --> 16:45.724
- I wouldn't say that.

16:46.931 --> 16:49.000
- You know, Liza, as a maid
of honor, you're a slow burn,

16:49.068 --> 16:52.206
but in the end,
you're white hot.

16:54.068 --> 16:57.448
- I am so,
so happy for you.

16:59.758 --> 17:01.344
If you make my eyes turn red,
I'll kill you.

17:01.413 --> 17:03.034
- Okay.

17:03.103 --> 17:04.586
- Oh, here, I'll hold
your wedding purse.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.068
- Oh, leave it. I threw up
in it two blocks ago.

17:06.137 --> 17:08.103
- Oh, okay, no problem.
I've got mints.

17:08.172 --> 17:09.344
- See what I mean?
White hot.

17:09.413 --> 17:10.448
- Yeah.

17:39.482 --> 17:43.689
- Does this count
as me reaching out?

17:43.758 --> 17:45.931
- It counts.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.310
- Hi.

18:02.379 --> 18:03.827
- You almost missed it,
plus one.

18:03.896 --> 18:05.275
It's okay.
It's okay.

18:14.379 --> 18:15.310
- What a lovely first dance.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.310
And now, everyone, please join

18:17.379 --> 18:20.379
the new Mr. and Mrs. DeLuca
on the dance floor.

18:23.379 --> 18:26.620
- That eye twitches every time
we call you Mrs. DeLuca.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.482
- Does that show?

18:29.551 --> 18:32.758
I'm sorry.

18:32.827 --> 18:36.931
- ♪ I should've never
let the time... ♪

18:44.413 --> 18:46.068
- Josh.
- Hi.

18:46.137 --> 18:47.344
- I didn't know you were...

18:47.413 --> 18:50.241
- Lauren--Lauren
needed a plus one, so...

18:52.448 --> 18:55.068
I know it's super weird
seeing me here,

18:55.137 --> 18:57.827
but it was a chance
to see you again,

18:57.896 --> 19:00.379
and I really
don't like the way

19:00.448 --> 19:04.206
that we ended things
the other night, so...

19:04.275 --> 19:08.000
And, let's be honest, if that
was our last conversation,

19:08.068 --> 19:09.413
it sucked.

19:11.482 --> 19:13.931
- Then I'm glad
that it wasn't.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.344
- Yeah.

19:15.413 --> 19:17.344
- It's really good
to see you.

19:17.413 --> 19:21.103
- Yeah.
- Really.

19:21.172 --> 19:22.620
And I hear Inkburg
is doing well.

19:22.689 --> 19:25.034
- Eh, kind of.

19:25.103 --> 19:26.758
Ah, it is.

19:26.827 --> 19:30.000
Funny thing, actually.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.344
You know that tattoo
I gave you?

19:31.413 --> 19:32.517
- Yes.

19:32.586 --> 19:35.206
- Well, they want
to license it.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.689
You know, they want
to promote it and put it

19:37.758 --> 19:41.379
on every single person
that wants to get it tattooed.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.172
I don't know, figured
I should ask you first,

19:43.241 --> 19:44.793
see if that was okay.

19:46.344 --> 19:49.275
- Oh, okay.
That's fine.

19:49.344 --> 19:51.137
- Yeah?
- Sure.

19:53.482 --> 19:57.241
- Okay.
Uh...

19:57.310 --> 20:00.344
Have a nice night.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.310
- Ah, I love it.

20:04.379 --> 20:08.413
- It's us,
living in the now.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.310
- Wait.

20:13.103 --> 20:16.620
If it's all the same
to you, that tattoo,

20:16.689 --> 20:18.413
it--it's ours.

20:18.482 --> 20:22.172
It's mine,
I mean.

20:22.241 --> 20:25.172
I wouldn't want anyone else
to have it.

20:25.241 --> 20:26.862
Is that okay?

20:26.931 --> 20:28.655
- Yeah.

20:30.137 --> 20:32.172
Yeah,
that's great.

20:35.172 --> 20:36.862
I'll see you around.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.206

20:48.275 --> 20:50.758
- ♪ Watching every motion... ♪

20:50.827 --> 20:53.517
- Memories?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.758
- What?

20:58.793 --> 21:00.620
Our song.

21:00.689 --> 21:02.413
Did you ask them
to play that?

21:02.482 --> 21:06.827
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:06.896 --> 21:10.241
May I have this dance?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.655
- Absolutely.

21:14.103 --> 21:18.068
- I've been thinking,
the trip to Scotland.

21:18.137 --> 21:21.068
I don't know if that's
the right thing, the kids.

21:21.137 --> 21:22.448
- No, you're right.

21:22.517 --> 21:23.862
I was--I was thinking
the same thing.

21:23.931 --> 21:25.758
You deserve time alone
with the girls.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.862
It's fine.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.172
- What I mean is,

21:28.241 --> 21:30.758
kids don't belong
on a honeymoon.

21:34.310 --> 21:35.827
- What?

21:35.896 --> 21:40.275
- You and I have been through
a lot these past few months,

21:40.344 --> 21:44.241
real-life ups and downs.

21:44.310 --> 21:45.655
And through it all,

21:45.724 --> 21:49.000
I have fallen deeper
and deeper in love with you.

21:49.068 --> 21:50.482
How could I not?

21:50.551 --> 21:53.965
I cannot imagine not waking up
each morning with you,

21:54.034 --> 21:58.413
with your smile
and your laugh,

21:58.482 --> 22:02.655
with everything about you.

22:02.724 --> 22:07.758
Liza Miller,
will you marry me?

22:07.827 --> 22:11.482
- Oh, my God.
Charles...

22:11.551 --> 22:14.137
- I do!
Charles, I do.

22:14.206 --> 22:16.862
I've been trying
to come up with reasons

22:16.931 --> 22:18.448
for the past half hour

22:18.517 --> 22:21.241
of why I wouldn't
say yes, and I can't.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.689
Yes, Charles,
I do want to come home.

22:23.758 --> 22:25.965
- Charles, Kelsey,
is it true?

22:26.034 --> 22:27.206
- Yes, I am coming back.

22:27.275 --> 22:29.034
- Charles, how did you
convince her?

22:29.103 --> 22:31.000
- Hey, Liza,
are you happy?

22:31.068 --> 22:33.034
- Yes, I am so happy.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.413
I just--

22:34.482 --> 22:36.758
I told you I got you, diva!
