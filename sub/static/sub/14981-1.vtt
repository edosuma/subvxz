Cal lightman sees the truth.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.501
It's written
all over your face.

00:42.568 --> 00:44.934
It's also in your voice,
your posture,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.534
The words you choose.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.401
Because of dr. lightman's
scientific discoveries,

00:49.468 --> 00:51.367
We know that these signs
are the same...

00:51.434 --> 00:53.234
Laying it on
a bit thick,
isn't she?

00:53.301 --> 00:55.367
It's called
selling books, dad.
shut up and bask.

00:55.434 --> 00:57.167
Now, give him 5 minutes
and 20 questions,

00:57.234 --> 01:00.534
And he'll know whether
you went off to argentina
to cheat on your wife,

01:00.600 --> 01:03.733
Lied about
a well-timed stock sale,

01:03.800 --> 01:06.434
Or murdered
a one-night stand.

01:06.501 --> 01:09.568
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in welcoming

01:09.633 --> 01:12.201
The world's foremost
deception expert

01:12.267 --> 01:14.034

preeminent scientists,

01:14.101 --> 01:17.600
<i>author of lies we tell,
dr. cal lightman.</i>

01:17.667 --> 01:20.434
[applause]

01:22.667 --> 01:26.367
Well, she's right
when she says i'll know
if you're lying,

01:26.434 --> 01:29.534
But what
i wanna know is why.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.667
That's still
your secret.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.501
Any questions?

01:33.568 --> 01:34.733
Dr. lightman.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.334
Thanks for coming.

01:40.034 --> 01:43.568
How come no one ever
looks me in the eye
at these things?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.134
Oh, cool tattoo.

01:47.201 --> 01:48.434
Who do
i make it out to?

01:48.501 --> 01:49.733
Uh, trisha, please.

01:50.967 --> 01:53.201
You're really the world's
biggest expert on lying?

01:53.267 --> 01:55.967
When he's
not being a dad or
a big-time author.

01:56.034 --> 01:59.000
So you'll know
i'm telling the truth.

01:59.067 --> 02:02.101
The police don't believe me.
no one does. i--

02:02.167 --> 02:05.201
I just really need
someone to believe me.

02:07.101 --> 02:09.334
I saw a murder.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.367
I didn't "see it" see it,
but i saw it

02:13.434 --> 02:16.568
In a vision,
a psychic vision,

02:16.633 --> 02:18.767
But i know
it really happened.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.733
Am i telling the truth?

02:26.767 --> 02:28.633
Yes, you are.

03:01.767 --> 03:02.700
Cal: hey.

03:02.767 --> 03:03.700
Hey. whoo.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.034
Where are we going?

03:05.101 --> 03:06.800
Surprise. oh.
divorce present.

03:06.867 --> 03:09.934
Wasn't planning to toast
the demise of my marriage,

03:10.000 --> 03:11.301
But thanks.

03:11.367 --> 03:12.367
How you feeling?

03:12.434 --> 03:13.367
Horrible,

03:13.434 --> 03:15.267
Depressed,
like a loser.

03:16.034 --> 03:17.568
You're happy.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.767
I'm not happy.
i'm devastated.

03:24.501 --> 03:26.234
All right,
trisha howell,

03:26.301 --> 03:27.967
She's a georgetown
law student,

03:28.034 --> 03:32.501
And she claims
she had a psychic vision
of a murder.

03:32.568 --> 03:34.534
I understand
the scientist in you

03:34.600 --> 03:37.234
Sees every day
as an opportunity
to discover

03:37.301 --> 03:39.134
Something new and wonderful
about the brain,

03:39.201 --> 03:41.367
But come on.
you don't believe in psychics.

03:41.434 --> 03:43.700
Well, as of now,
i'm switzerland.

03:43.767 --> 03:45.733
Plus our plate
is too full for this.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.733
We have a potential
supreme court nominee to vet.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.800
Well, i do believe
there's a scientific

03:49.867 --> 03:52.534
Explanation
for what she saw.

03:55.501 --> 03:58.934
Uh, trisha howell,
this is, uh,
gillian foster.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.633
Why don't you
tell foster here
about your vision.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.900
Um, i started
writing it down,

04:05.967 --> 04:08.468
But, um, i saw a man...

04:08.534 --> 04:11.800
Tall, short black hair,
blue eyes.

04:11.867 --> 04:16.966
He's in a hotel, room 202,
and he's freaking out.

04:17.034 --> 04:19.867
There's blood all over.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.767
Whose blood was it?
did you see a victim?

04:22.834 --> 04:25.700
Just an ashtray
smashing down,

04:25.767 --> 04:27.267
And then he's running, and...

04:27.334 --> 04:29.900
The hotel sign has
some kind of a devil on it.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.568
It's, uh--

04:31.633 --> 04:35.367
It's by that druggie park
over off of "l" street.

04:35.434 --> 04:38.733
Can you excuse us
for just one moment?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.468
That was a smooth exit line.
it was very professional.

04:48.534 --> 04:51.733
This is a matter
for the police or
a magic 8-ball.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.067
Right, these are
the options--

04:53.134 --> 04:55.667
One...

04:55.733 --> 04:57.234
Trisha's ill;

04:57.301 --> 04:59.468
2, she actually
is a psychic;

04:59.534 --> 05:01.800
3, she witnessed
a murder

05:01.867 --> 05:04.034
And no one
believes her.

05:04.101 --> 05:06.667
In any of these cases,
she needs our help,
right?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.334
Agent reynolds is waiting
with judge simon.

05:09.401 --> 05:11.301
Potential
supreme court nominee.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.067
Mmm.

05:13.134 --> 05:14.733
Right.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.067
Ah, here he is.

05:17.134 --> 05:19.401
Judge simon, this is
dr. cal lightman.

05:19.468 --> 05:22.167
Glad you could
clear your schedule
on such short notice.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.501
Yeah, well,
i couldn't, actually.
this is ria torres.

05:24.568 --> 05:28.267
She's gonna determine
whether or not you're
a lying son of a bitch.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.034
[gasps] just one...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.468
The president
specifically
asked for you.

05:36.534 --> 05:39.401
You do know i can tell
when you're lying, don't you?

05:39.468 --> 05:40.667
Yeah, well,
how 'bout this?

05:40.733 --> 05:42.568
Vetting this guy
is the f.b.i.'s
responsibility,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.600
And you have
a contractual obligation

05:44.667 --> 05:45.967
To give f.b.i. cases
top priority.

05:46.034 --> 05:47.934
Lightman group
has that obligation,
not lightman proper.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.234
And, uh, torres
is a natural, remember?
she's gonna do fine.

05:50.301 --> 05:51.700
No, fine's not gonna cut it.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.700
If this guy's got
some deep, dark secrets--

05:53.767 --> 05:55.434
He does. he does.
we all do.

05:55.501 --> 05:56.468
Let me be clear.

05:56.534 --> 05:58.434
My ass is on the line.

05:58.501 --> 05:59.967
Zoe.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.667
I was just
gonna call you.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.900
I saved you the trouble.
hi, ben.

06:04.967 --> 06:05.900
Hey.
testy ex-wife

06:05.967 --> 06:07.834
Trumps testy
f.b.i. agent.
excuse us.

06:07.900 --> 06:08.900
We're not done.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.700
Always nice
to see you, zoe.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.067
Nice to see you, ben.

06:12.134 --> 06:16.434
Emily says you've
been good weird.
she's concerned.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.234
I quit the department
of justice.

06:18.301 --> 06:21.568
I'm moving to chicago
to head up my own practice.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.834
What does emily have
to say about this?

06:24.900 --> 06:27.134
She doesn't know yet,
and since she'll wonder

06:27.201 --> 06:29.134
Why i'm not
going in to work,

06:29.201 --> 06:32.501
I figured we should
probably tell her
before then, say, today.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.967
Well, chicago's
a nice town.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.301
Not close, though.

06:37.367 --> 06:39.834
Well, you were always
the one who said
if i had any guts,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.401
I would start
my own law firm.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.401
Yeah, but, chicago?

06:42.468 --> 06:44.067
You remember dave gruber
from law school?

06:44.134 --> 06:45.568
The handsy, flirty guy.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.000
Heh.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.600
You're gonna work for
the handsy, flirty guy?

06:49.667 --> 06:51.334
No, i'm not going to be
working for him.

06:51.401 --> 06:53.501
I'm gonna be
running a new branch
of his law firm.

06:53.568 --> 06:54.800
Yeah, but still
not your firm, though.

06:54.867 --> 06:56.733
I knew you would
try to make me
change my mind,

06:56.800 --> 06:59.568
And i'm not
going to, ok? it's done,
so just be happy for me.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.600
I am happy for you.
good.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.900
It'd just be
quite an adjustment for emily.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.700
It'll take time.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.468
She's an amazing kid.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.434
You wanna take emily
to chicago.

07:14.501 --> 07:15.900
I've already
made a schedule

07:15.967 --> 07:17.934
Where you can have her
for the holidays,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.367
And, you know, you're
free to come to chicago
any time you want.

07:21.434 --> 07:23.034
You know,
we can make this work.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.234
Look, i'm not saying
it's not selfish,

07:25.301 --> 07:27.000
But the right thing
for me

07:27.067 --> 07:29.900
Also happens
to be the right thing
for emily.

07:32.167 --> 07:34.000
Don't do that.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.667
You know i hate it
when you do that.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.700
Thanks for waiting,
judge simon.

07:49.767 --> 07:54.733
I came here
fully prepared to be
vetted by an expert.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.867
How old are you?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.733
24.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.234
Let's get started.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.700
Where's the girl?

08:14.767 --> 08:16.800
There was a girl
in there claiming

08:16.867 --> 08:18.534
Psychic abilities.
where is she?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.568
Where's the girl?

08:22.633 --> 08:26.067
Oh. do we have
funds for a study
on herd behavior?

08:26.134 --> 08:27.334
The girl,
where is she?

08:27.401 --> 08:29.101
She left.
oh, and you let her?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.134
I run a research lab,
not a prison.

08:31.201 --> 08:32.433
She wanted to leave.
she left.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.167
Where are you going?

08:34.234 --> 08:35.568
None of my business.

08:35.633 --> 08:38.433
Check. power of nonverbal
communication. awesome. love it.

08:38.501 --> 08:41.366
Boom.

08:52.468 --> 08:54.633
You got a room?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.468
You lookin' for company?

08:56.534 --> 08:57.468
Uh, no.

08:57.534 --> 08:58.733
Not in this economy.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.501
I'll settle for
the porn package.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.867
Well, that does
appear to be blood.

09:23.934 --> 09:25.900
Well, we need
to find the girl.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.800
I assume you wanna
bring her downtown.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.367
The girl with
the psychic visions?

09:29.434 --> 09:30.967
Well, why don't
we just have her

09:31.034 --> 09:32.234
Give us tomorrow's
lottery numbers,

09:32.301 --> 09:34.000
And we can all
retire early?

09:34.867 --> 09:37.000
Nice to meet you.

09:38.334 --> 09:40.600
So this is what you
dragged me down here for.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.167
You know, every hotel room
this side of town

09:43.234 --> 09:46.267
Is gonna be ripe with blood
and various other
human discharges.

09:46.334 --> 09:47.834
No body, no crime.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.900
I'm gettin' back
to the judge.

09:50.967 --> 09:53.534
I suggest you do the same.

09:55.034 --> 09:58.301
Well, that's it for your,
you know, most prominent cases.

09:58.367 --> 10:04.367
Uh, let's move on
to your family.

10:04.434 --> 10:06.267
Ah. ok.

10:06.334 --> 10:09.101
Celia, your wife,
tell me about her.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.733
What would
you like to know?

10:10.800 --> 10:14.767
Uh, well, i guess the--
the big one is, uh,
have you ever cheated on her?

10:14.834 --> 10:17.900
I can't imagine
any senator on
the judiciary committee

10:17.967 --> 10:19.000
Asking me that.

10:19.067 --> 10:22.167
Oh, no. that's not--
i mean, i--i just--

10:22.234 --> 10:23.767
I have to ask you.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.101
The answer's no.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.468
So you've never
been interested

10:27.534 --> 10:29.334
In another woman
in that time?

10:29.401 --> 10:30.900
Never.

10:32.367 --> 10:35.267
Really?

10:35.334 --> 10:36.633
You never cheated?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.267
He said no.

10:39.201 --> 10:41.468
Did you ever cheat
on your taxes?

10:41.534 --> 10:43.167
Torres.

10:43.234 --> 10:44.101
No,

10:44.167 --> 10:45.568
And i've been
paying them

10:45.633 --> 10:47.401
Longer than you've
been breathing air.

10:47.468 --> 10:49.867
My age really bothers you.

10:49.934 --> 10:53.067
In my experience,
anybody under
the age of 35

10:53.134 --> 10:56.767
Normally doesn't
know their ass from
a hole in the ground.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.900
So, yes, the fact
that you're standing

10:59.967 --> 11:01.934
Between me
and a position

11:02.000 --> 11:05.201
On the supreme court
of the united states
of america

11:05.267 --> 11:07.067
Does not thrill me.

11:36.633 --> 11:38.501
Trisha.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.667
Found this
under the bed.

11:47.101 --> 11:48.867
Who are you?

11:48.934 --> 11:50.134
What do you want?

11:50.201 --> 11:52.201
Don't you know me?

11:52.267 --> 11:54.167
Oh, yeah, yeah.
i know you.

11:54.234 --> 11:56.568
You and me,
we're old friends, babe.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.767
Tell me your name.

11:59.834 --> 12:01.600
Why should i?

12:08.867 --> 12:10.134
It's jessie.

12:10.934 --> 12:12.267
I'm cal lightman.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.501
We met earlier today.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.934
Only, then you
were someone else.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.134
I'll be anybody
you want me to be.

12:19.201 --> 12:21.633
I wanna spend
some time with you.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.800
No.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.167
Not like that.

12:27.468 --> 12:29.834
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.834
Gonna cost you extra.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.800
Foster: the camera,
the strange white room.

12:41.867 --> 12:43.100
She's afraid.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.601
And we're about
to get funky.

12:47.668 --> 12:49.534
4 hours ago...

12:51.434 --> 12:54.833
Right before
she ran out of here.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.067
Shoulders back.
chest out.

12:57.134 --> 12:58.734
Totally different posture.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.134
Totally different girl.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.634
Eli: hello, hair.

13:02.701 --> 13:05.634
Trisha walked
into that room,
and jessie walked out.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.301
Yeah. for funsies,
i had...

13:08.367 --> 13:10.234
Hooker jessie
write down her
coffee order,

13:10.301 --> 13:13.601
And i compared
that to law student
trisha's account

13:13.668 --> 13:15.467
Of her
so-called vision.

13:15.534 --> 13:16.668
Night and day.

13:16.734 --> 13:17.734
These 2 documents

13:17.800 --> 13:19.467
Indicate
2 fundamentally

13:19.534 --> 13:21.701
Different
personalities.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.067
Trisha's got it,

13:23.134 --> 13:25.800
Multiple personality
disorder.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.367
The holy grail
of psychiatry.

13:27.434 --> 13:30.167
This is your
divorce present.

13:30.234 --> 13:31.967
It's dissociative
identity disorder,

13:32.034 --> 13:35.167
And it's--
it's more plausible than
a psychic phenomenon,

13:35.234 --> 13:36.167
But just barely.

13:36.234 --> 13:37.701
Of course,
if it is d.i.d.,

13:37.768 --> 13:39.167
There's empirical
evidence of explicit

13:39.234 --> 13:40.668
Memory transfer
in such cases.

13:40.734 --> 13:44.000
I mean, she could have--
she could have perceived
that as a vision.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.567
So her alter
witnessed a murder.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.200
Or committed a murder.

13:48.267 --> 13:51.567
No. no, this girl
didn't hurt anyone.

13:51.634 --> 13:52.900
If she had, her
other personalities

13:52.967 --> 13:54.933
Would never
have let her come
to me, right?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.301
Jessie probably
isn't the only alter.

13:58.367 --> 13:59.800
Right.

14:09.833 --> 14:13.034
You know i can see you
all out there staring at me.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.134
Loker.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.367
What the hell?

14:23.434 --> 14:25.434
Just giving you
some privacy.

14:25.501 --> 14:27.267
Met some freaks
in my time,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.100
But this place
is perv central.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.134
Oh, you might
have a point there.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.501
Guess if you're
payin' for it.

14:37.067 --> 14:40.134
Why'd you sneak
into that hotel room?

14:40.200 --> 14:41.634
Why did you?

14:41.701 --> 14:43.567
Were you trying
to cover up a crime?

14:43.634 --> 14:45.367
No.

14:45.434 --> 14:47.067
Lip curl,
forced eye contact.

14:47.134 --> 14:48.467
You're lying.

14:48.534 --> 14:50.833
I'm not some lab rat.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.833
Did you
kill somebody?

14:54.234 --> 14:56.167
No.

14:56.234 --> 14:57.833
Heart rate
and blood pressure
are steady.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.100
It's not determinate,
but she's believable.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.334
I'm gonna go see how jessie
feels about hypnosis.

15:03.401 --> 15:04.933
Bring your wallet.

15:06.567 --> 15:09.501
You presided over 16 cases
before your 35th birthday,

15:09.567 --> 15:11.833
<i>starting with
cahill v. wilson,</i>

15:11.900 --> 15:15.134
<i>then abandandou v. temple...</i>

15:16.567 --> 15:19.067
<i>ohio v. george.</i>

15:20.900 --> 15:24.234
<i>all right, ohio v. george.</i>

15:25.367 --> 15:27.401
Why do you have that reaction
to that case?

15:27.467 --> 15:29.167
What reaction?

15:29.234 --> 15:33.000
A drifter named bryce george
raped 56-year-old margaret lane.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.301
Where's agent reynolds?

15:34.367 --> 15:38.000
Busy. you gave him life
in prison for a first offense?

15:40.567 --> 15:44.501
You think i should
have given him
a lesser sentence?

15:46.434 --> 15:50.100
Agent reynolds doesn't
know that we've started
up again, does he?

15:50.167 --> 15:53.234
Did you have
a personal relationship
with margaret lane?

15:53.301 --> 15:55.634
No.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.401
I may be 24, but i have
a talent for spotting lies.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.467
Move on, ms. torres.

16:05.534 --> 16:07.867
You know, you really
shouldn't speak that way

16:07.933 --> 16:10.967
To the person
standing between you
and the supreme court.

16:15.701 --> 16:18.634
Just listen to my voice
and float.

16:18.701 --> 16:21.867
As you listen to my voice,
keep breathing,

16:21.933 --> 16:24.467
Getting heavier
with each exhale,

16:24.534 --> 16:28.933
Again, allowing yourself
to fall into a deep...

16:29.000 --> 16:32.100
Deep sleep.

16:32.167 --> 16:34.167
In their
conscious lives,

16:34.234 --> 16:36.100
The alters aren't
aware of each other.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.234
Hopefully hypnosis
will allow foster

16:38.301 --> 16:40.734
To tap into their
shared unconscious.

16:41.933 --> 16:43.967
Torres is
in over her head
with judge simon.

16:44.034 --> 16:47.134
You know, i could, um--
i could jump in on that.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.000
I'm just saying
i have seniority,

16:49.067 --> 16:51.768
And if the wrong guy gets
put on the supreme court,

16:51.833 --> 16:56.034
I mean, that could
really affect the whole
future of the county.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.234
Yeah, i'm fine here.

16:58.301 --> 16:59.768
Now that you're
fully relaxed,

16:59.833 --> 17:01.467
You can open your eyes.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.601
Is it all right if i ask you
a few questions?

17:07.667 --> 17:09.534
Sure.

17:09.601 --> 17:11.667
Can you tell me
about trisha?

17:11.733 --> 17:13.134
Ucch. her.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.467
You don't like her?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.099
She thinks
she's so perfect.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.300
Anyway, gavin likes me
way better.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.067
Who's gavin?

17:21.134 --> 17:22.833
My best friend.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.733
Why don't you
tell me about him?

17:24.800 --> 17:26.134
I don't want to.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.301
Well, maybe trisha
can tell me about him.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.334
Can i speak to her?

17:31.401 --> 17:33.501
[deep breath]

17:42.601 --> 17:43.768
Hi, dr. foster.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.067
Trisha?

17:45.134 --> 17:48.034
What--what am i
doing here?

17:48.100 --> 17:50.067
I met jessie today.

17:50.134 --> 17:51.668
Oh.

17:51.734 --> 17:54.401
You two don't get along.

17:54.467 --> 17:56.367
She's very crass.

17:56.434 --> 17:59.100
Jessie was telling me
about gavin.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.067
She would.

18:01.134 --> 18:02.867
She thinks
he adores her.

18:02.933 --> 18:04.967
Trisha, did anything bad
happen to you?

18:05.034 --> 18:07.267
You know, anything
when you were younger?

18:08.401 --> 18:11.000
The bad things
happen to r.j.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.967
R.j.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.867
That's a new name.

18:14.933 --> 18:16.867
Can i talk to her?

18:16.933 --> 18:18.000
You mean him.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.668
R.j. doesn't
talk to people.

18:19.734 --> 18:22.034
R.j.'s strong.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.134
Nobody can hurt him.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.734
He protects
the rest of us.

18:28.367 --> 18:31.134
I don't wanna think
about this anymore.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.867
You're doing great.
no problem.

18:33.933 --> 18:36.067
All right,
you can close your eyes.

18:36.900 --> 18:37.800
On my count,

18:37.867 --> 18:40.167
You're gonna wake up
feeling refreshed.

18:40.234 --> 18:41.967
You'll be
completely yourself.

18:43.134 --> 18:44.067
3,

18:44.134 --> 18:45.167
2,

18:45.234 --> 18:46.800
1.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.501
[whimpering]

18:56.567 --> 18:59.234
Trisha. trisha,
you're--you're safe.

18:59.301 --> 19:00.768
Ahh!

19:01.734 --> 19:03.701
Trisha, you're safe.
trisha.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.734
Trisha, you're safe.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.067
I'm not trisha.

19:08.134 --> 19:10.501
I-i'm sophie.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.768
[sobbing]
i'm sophie.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.768
I'm sophie.
i'm sophie.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.501
I'm sophie.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.501
I'm sophie.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.933
Sophie,
i'm dr. cal lightman.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.933
This is
dr. gillian foster.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.200
Try to relax, please.

19:31.267 --> 19:32.900
I don't wanna be
in a hospital.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.034
It's not a hospital.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.067
It may look
kind of weird,

19:36.134 --> 19:38.734
But this is
where i work.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.100
You came to me.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.434
Which one of me?

19:42.501 --> 19:45.100
You know about
the other personalities?

19:45.167 --> 19:49.900
You know about
trisha and jessie
and, uh--and r.j.?

19:49.967 --> 19:52.933
They stole my life.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.167
Sophie, are--are you
the core personality?

19:55.234 --> 19:57.501
I'm the real person,

19:57.567 --> 20:00.301
The doctors say.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.734
Wh-what did they do?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.567
They did
something bad?

20:09.967 --> 20:12.734
We believe one
of your personalities
witnessed a murder.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.768
Trisha came to me because
she thought i could help.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.167
God. why?

20:19.234 --> 20:22.933
She tried the police,
but they didn't believe her.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.933
The work i do here
is determining the truth,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.334
And i do believe her.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.401
I think we can help you.

20:30.467 --> 20:34.000
You can't help me.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.701
Nobody can help me.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.601
There's a murderer out there
who may know who you are.

20:39.668 --> 20:41.933
We need to prove
a crime happened

20:42.000 --> 20:44.134
To get the police involved.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.034
Can you tell me
who gavin is?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.534
I don't know.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.900
Sophie...

20:54.833 --> 20:58.200
[buzzer]

21:00.034 --> 21:01.501
You're safe here.

21:01.567 --> 21:05.134
You can trust us.
i promise.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.467
Gavin's my brother.

21:10.534 --> 21:14.900
I don't see him,
ever.

21:16.867 --> 21:19.601
Um, jessie does.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.534
<i>starting with
cahill v. wilson,</i>

21:25.601 --> 21:27.301
<i>then abandandou v. temple,</i>

21:27.367 --> 21:29.034
<i>ohio v. george.</i>

21:29.100 --> 21:30.301
Look. right there.

21:30.367 --> 21:31.200
21c.

21:31.267 --> 21:32.900
That's fear.

21:32.967 --> 21:34.134
If you say so.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.900
He doesn't want me
anywhere near that case.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.800
<i>ok, watch this.
ohio v. george</i>

21:38.867 --> 21:41.601
Was a rape case.
nicole lane was
the victim's daughter.

21:43.301 --> 21:46.134
And now he will never
hurt another woman.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.000
Judge simon
did the right thing.

21:48.067 --> 21:51.000
He's a noble man,
and i'll always be grateful.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.867
Her pupils dilate
when she talks
about the judge.

21:54.967 --> 21:56.401
That's arousal.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.401
And her voice
gets all gooey.

21:58.467 --> 22:01.134
Heh. well, you expect me
to tell the president

22:01.200 --> 22:03.734
Not to nominate this guy
because 20 years ago,

22:03.800 --> 22:05.800
Some woman's voice
got all gooey.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.933
Have you even
talked to her?

22:08.967 --> 22:09.933
She died.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.200
Ovarian cancer
2 years ago.

22:11.267 --> 22:12.467
But look.
watch this.

22:19.234 --> 22:20.401
It's the same face.

22:20.467 --> 22:22.134
I am telling you,
he had an affair

22:22.200 --> 22:23.367
With nicole lane
during that trial.

22:23.434 --> 22:26.034
Or maybe you just
don't like the guy.

22:26.100 --> 22:26.967
Excuse me?

22:27.034 --> 22:28.167
Come on.
i'm no face reader,

22:28.234 --> 22:30.234
But even i can see it.
he's a liar,

22:30.301 --> 22:32.134
A liar who had
an affair with someone

22:32.200 --> 22:33.900
Directly involved in
a case he was deciding.

22:33.967 --> 22:36.134
He doesn't deserve to be
on the supreme court.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.434
Maybe, maybe not,
but, see, the problem is

22:38.501 --> 22:40.167
The second that
this got personal,

22:40.234 --> 22:42.668
You lost the right
to make that decision.

22:52.634 --> 22:53.634
Hi. how you doin'?

22:53.701 --> 22:55.034
Gavin howell? i'm--

22:55.100 --> 22:56.768
Jessie?

23:00.067 --> 23:01.768
Oh, my god.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.000
Sophie?

23:10.334 --> 23:13.067
What happened
to your sister?

23:13.134 --> 23:14.501
Well, whatever it was,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.768
You blame yourself,
don't you?

23:19.567 --> 23:21.067
The two of us
spent summers

23:21.134 --> 23:23.634
At our
grandparents' farm
in upstate new york.

23:24.967 --> 23:26.933
Uh, for me,
it was heaven.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.267
Not for sophie?

23:30.467 --> 23:34.234
I didn't know
till i was 10
and she was 13.

23:34.301 --> 23:37.134
I walked into the barn,
and my grandfather...

23:38.534 --> 23:40.100
Did things to her.

23:41.634 --> 23:43.100
It was evil.

23:43.167 --> 23:46.367
When did you first start
seeing a change in her,

23:46.434 --> 23:47.701
That she was different?

23:47.768 --> 23:49.701
Jessie showed up
the next summer,

23:49.768 --> 23:51.367
Selling herself
to local kids.

23:51.434 --> 23:53.034
Uh, trisha came later.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.034
They visit you.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.467
Jessie does.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.768
She crashes in my shed

23:56.833 --> 23:59.301
When she's had
a rough night, but i--

24:00.668 --> 24:03.167
Not lately. i haven't
seen her in months.

24:08.267 --> 24:09.668
I really stay here?

24:09.734 --> 24:13.601
Scared the hell out of me
first time you showed up.

24:17.701 --> 24:19.634
Foster: does anything
feel familiar, sophie?

24:19.701 --> 24:23.334
Uh, i got
that bike for my
seventh birthday.

24:24.567 --> 24:27.734
I smell that bad, gavin?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.668
You're holding
your breath,

24:30.734 --> 24:33.800
Which could
mean you're
tense or upset...

24:33.867 --> 24:36.601
Or it could
mean you're
hiding something.

24:38.134 --> 24:39.567
[exhales]

24:39.634 --> 24:41.701
Exhale marks the spot.

24:50.501 --> 24:52.200
Gavin.

24:52.267 --> 24:53.467
I'm sorry.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.434
I can--i really can't
protect you, can i?

25:06.501 --> 25:09.567
Kyle arnow.

25:10.668 --> 25:12.401
Did i kill him?

25:14.234 --> 25:15.933
[uses knocker]

25:17.933 --> 25:19.000
Hi.
yes?

25:19.067 --> 25:21.034
Um, sorry about
the intrusion.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.334
I--i was just driving by,
and i saw your car.

25:23.401 --> 25:24.601
It's a beautiful car.

25:24.668 --> 25:25.434
Thank you.

25:25.501 --> 25:27.301
I don't suppose
it's for sale.

25:27.367 --> 25:28.467
It's my husband's.

25:28.534 --> 25:30.200
Oh.
kyle.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.800
Another man
is in love
with your car.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.134
Well, good taste.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.034
I had the interior
completely restored
about 6 years ago.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.367
That's a nice job.

25:37.434 --> 25:41.034
I found this...

25:41.100 --> 25:45.167
And i thought
you were dead.

25:45.234 --> 25:46.668
Where'd you get that?

25:46.734 --> 25:49.734
No, no. it's just, uh, evidence
in a murder investigation.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.800
Murder? what are you
talking about?

25:55.768 --> 25:58.634
So you didn't do it, then.

25:58.701 --> 25:59.900
You have to go away.

25:59.967 --> 26:01.567
Does your wife know
you like hookers?

26:01.634 --> 26:02.567
No, because i don't.

26:02.634 --> 26:03.900
'cause, you know,
the only thing

26:03.967 --> 26:06.800
I didn't find in your wallet
was a condom.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.267
Why don't we ask your wife...

26:09.334 --> 26:11.134
[uses knocker]

26:11.200 --> 26:12.134
Hey.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.267
How your wallet ended up

26:13.334 --> 26:15.534
Covered in blood
at a murder scene, shall we?

26:18.501 --> 26:20.734
Ok, 2 working girls
robbed me

26:20.800 --> 26:22.067
At some hotel
downtown.

26:22.134 --> 26:23.701
I fought back,
and i ran,

26:23.768 --> 26:25.200
But that's
not my blood,

26:25.267 --> 26:28.501
So how 'bout you
just mind your own
damn business?

26:30.734 --> 26:33.200
Ok.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.134
Ok, kyle.

26:39.034 --> 26:40.167
What?

26:40.234 --> 26:43.668
Oh. your husband likes
unprotected sex with hookers,

26:43.734 --> 26:46.100
So it might be a good time
to get yourself tested

26:46.167 --> 26:47.867
For, uh, you know...

26:47.933 --> 26:49.367
Everything, really.

26:50.368 --> 26:51.368
Nice car, Kyle.

27:02.317 --> 27:05.784
Ok, let's say sophie
didn't kill anybody.

27:05.851 --> 27:08.884
Or jessie or trisha.

27:08.951 --> 27:10.951
But there's another
personality out there,

27:11.017 --> 27:13.350
A male personality, r.j.

27:13.417 --> 27:15.450
Yeah, but we don't even
know if he exists.

27:15.517 --> 27:18.184
I think he does.
i think he's the protector,

27:18.250 --> 27:20.884
The one who emerges when
there are violent situations.

27:20.951 --> 27:24.884
What if he perceived sophie
to be in trouble?

27:24.951 --> 27:26.817
Who knows
what could have happened?

27:26.884 --> 27:29.250
Yeah, but it
doesn't make him
a killer, does it?

27:29.317 --> 27:31.751
R.j. could have
witnessed the murder.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.383
Things get ugly.
jessie gets scared.

27:34.450 --> 27:38.584
And transitions into r.j.,
the protector,

27:38.650 --> 27:44.484
Meaning it was r.j.
that trisha saw in her vision.

27:44.550 --> 27:46.751
R.j. running
down a street.

27:46.817 --> 27:48.851
R.j. washing off
the blood.

27:50.350 --> 27:53.784
We talk to r.j.,
we'll get to the truth.

27:53.851 --> 27:55.550
Sometimes i wake up,

27:55.617 --> 27:58.317
And i'm walking across
the georgetown quad

27:58.383 --> 28:01.017
With a backpack full
of books i've never seen,

28:01.084 --> 28:02.851
Or i'm in a changing room

28:02.917 --> 28:05.784
Trying on an outfit
i've never picked out,

28:05.851 --> 28:09.751
Or the worst one, i'm--

28:09.817 --> 28:13.317
I'm stumbling out
of some guy's car.

28:17.151 --> 28:19.017
I just wanna be me.

28:20.051 --> 28:23.017
Well, you'll get there, love.

28:24.784 --> 28:29.250
Maybe one day, one of 'em
will take over for good,

28:29.317 --> 28:32.717
And i'll just be gone.

28:32.784 --> 28:33.984
[door opens]

28:34.051 --> 28:36.550
Hey, so mom
said you wanted
to talk to m--

28:36.617 --> 28:38.550
Bad timing.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.784
Hi. i'm sorry.
unlike my dad,

28:41.851 --> 28:43.550
I'm not normally
totally insensitive.

28:43.617 --> 28:44.951
That's ok.

28:45.017 --> 28:47.584
Uh, you hungry?
let's get a snack.

28:54.051 --> 28:56.118
Is she ok?
yeah.

28:57.383 --> 28:58.650
No, not really.

28:58.717 --> 29:01.751
Well, did she really
witness a murder?

29:01.817 --> 29:04.484
That's nothing for you
to think about.

29:04.550 --> 29:06.317
All right?

29:06.383 --> 29:09.317
I wanna talk to you
about something else.

29:09.383 --> 29:12.383
Just please tell me
you and mom aren't, like,

29:12.450 --> 29:14.817
Getting back together
or something.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.550
Ah, no, no. um...

for your mum.

Not now!

29:24.584 --> 29:26.250
Hey.

29:26.317 --> 29:28.751
Remember when i
said, "no body,
no crime"?

29:28.817 --> 29:29.917
Yeah, well, i just
got off the phone

29:29.984 --> 29:31.017
With
my detective friend.

29:31.084 --> 29:32.484
There's a body,
a prostitute

29:32.550 --> 29:34.317
By the name
of amber o'malley.

29:34.383 --> 29:35.383
She's been
known to work

29:35.450 --> 29:36.751
Out of the devil
may care hotel.

29:36.817 --> 29:37.751
That changes things.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.784
The cops, they wanna
talk to your girl,

29:39.851 --> 29:41.017

Ok.

29:56.184 --> 29:58.218
And we'll talk
about this later.

Watch him.

32:12.383 --> 32:13.951
R.j.'s
the protector.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.484
He never needed
to talk.

needed to talk.

I know you
wanna help sophie.

32:56.917 --> 33:00.518
You've been trying to help her
all along, haven't you?

33:01.984 --> 33:03.317
Now, you showed trisha.

33:03.384 --> 33:06.284
She thought she was
having visions, but...

33:06.351 --> 33:08.950
You were showing her
what happened, weren't you?

33:09.017 --> 33:11.317
Now, trisha's seen pieces.

33:11.384 --> 33:14.484
If you wanna help sophie,

33:14.583 --> 33:16.850
Trisha needs to see
all of it.

33:16.917 --> 33:19.583
You understand?

33:19.650 --> 33:23.384
Now, i know
you can't tell me,

33:23.451 --> 33:26.351
But you can show her...

another vision.

who killed the girl.

Nothing but the truth,
we'll have you out
of here in a jiffy.

like a little bug.

34:15.016 --> 34:16.351

Good. um...

34:19.317 --> 34:22.150
Nicole lane, why'd you
have sex with her?

34:22.217 --> 34:25.984
I told her and
i'll tell you
i didn't.

34:26.051 --> 34:29.251
Hmm. would you say
you were in love with her?

34:31.617 --> 34:34.251
Nicole came
to the courtroom
every day.

34:34.317 --> 34:36.117
I was young, and i
shouldn't have,

34:36.184 --> 34:40.217
But i spoke with her
a couple of times
in the hallway,

34:40.284 --> 34:42.251
Always briefly.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.949
But there
were feelings...

34:48.717 --> 34:50.750
Inappropriate
feelings.

34:50.817 --> 34:53.817
Then she asked
to see me

34:53.884 --> 34:55.984
In my chambers
one day.

34:56.051 --> 34:57.984
We kissed...

34:58.051 --> 34:59.884
Just once.

34:59.950 --> 35:04.217
Do you think your
feelings for her affected
your judgment in the case?

35:04.284 --> 35:06.817
Did that kiss
affect the sentence?

35:06.884 --> 35:09.683
My behavior was
improper and unethical,

35:09.750 --> 35:12.617
And i deeply regret it,

35:12.683 --> 35:16.217
But it did not affect
the sentence.

35:21.817 --> 35:24.117
Right.

35:24.184 --> 35:26.284
Right. well, i think
we're done here.

35:26.351 --> 35:28.750
I think it best that i
withdraw my name.

35:30.117 --> 35:32.251
Why?

35:32.317 --> 35:34.284
You were young.

35:34.351 --> 35:37.550
Your feelings got in the way,
you made a mistake,

35:37.617 --> 35:40.518
But you've lived
a good life since then.

35:43.984 --> 35:46.717
Let's hope the president
agrees with you.

35:46.784 --> 35:50.184
Judge simon,
let me walk you out.

35:56.451 --> 35:57.717
You write this up,

35:57.784 --> 36:00.217
But you choose
your words carefully,
all right?

36:00.284 --> 36:03.550
Why'd you put me
on this case?

36:03.617 --> 36:05.384
You knew i wasn't ready.

36:05.451 --> 36:08.418
Well, far as i can tell,
you nailed it.

36:10.451 --> 36:13.717
Look, what do you wanna
be when you grow up?

36:13.784 --> 36:16.184
I am grown-up.

36:16.251 --> 36:17.817
Terrific. what are you?

36:17.884 --> 36:18.917
I'm--i'm a--

36:18.984 --> 36:20.884
You're on your way
to becoming

36:20.950 --> 36:24.017
One of the world's
leading experts
in deception.

36:25.484 --> 36:29.084
But up here, you're
still a baggage screener
at the airport.

36:29.151 --> 36:33.418
Till you change that,
you'll always think
you're not ready.

36:41.451 --> 36:44.750
When i was 14,
my boyfriend robbed
a convenience store.

36:45.850 --> 36:47.351
I was in the car.

36:47.418 --> 36:49.451
I knew he was
gonna do it,

36:49.518 --> 36:51.917
Didn't know
he'd have a gun.

36:51.984 --> 36:56.051
Nobody got hurt,
but somebody could have.

36:56.117 --> 36:59.418
So for me, baggage screener
was a big step up.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.850
Well,
keep steppin', then.

37:08.750 --> 37:11.151
[indistinct chatter]

37:13.351 --> 37:14.884
Hey, baby.

37:14.950 --> 37:16.950
Where you been?

37:17.017 --> 37:18.750
You miss me?

37:18.817 --> 37:20.617
No.

37:21.717 --> 37:24.317
Figured you'd be
in jail by now.

37:24.384 --> 37:26.850
Figured you'd be
in jail by now.

37:26.917 --> 37:28.217
I don't follow.

37:28.284 --> 37:29.950
We both know
i was there

37:30.017 --> 37:31.950
For your little tantrum
the other night.

37:32.017 --> 37:36.184
We both know i was there
for your little tantrum
the other night.

37:36.251 --> 37:37.917
That's crazy talk.

37:39.084 --> 37:40.217
Why didn't you just
send her in as the hooker?

37:40.284 --> 37:42.284
The hooker doesn't
know the whole story.

37:42.351 --> 37:44.084
Sophie does,
and the hooker's a liar.

37:44.151 --> 37:45.518
Sophie remembers
what happened?

37:45.583 --> 37:46.784
Not exactly.

37:46.850 --> 37:49.451
R.j. used their
shared consciousness
to show trisha.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.950
Trisha told lightman.
lightman told sophie.

37:52.817 --> 37:54.251
Now it's important
for sophie

37:54.317 --> 37:55.550
To get her power back.

37:55.617 --> 37:57.650
I'm not sure
she's pulling it off.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.317
She's definitely
not jessie.

37:59.384 --> 38:01.550
What do you want,
jessie?

38:01.617 --> 38:03.650
The same thing we all
want, darlin', money.

38:03.717 --> 38:05.617
Money in my pocket,
you give me that,

38:05.683 --> 38:08.184
I'll give you the wallet
you want so bad.

38:08.251 --> 38:09.151
What wallet?

38:09.217 --> 38:11.084
The one with amber's
blood all over it,

38:11.151 --> 38:13.051
Your fingerprints, too.

38:13.117 --> 38:14.451
And your
fingerprints.

38:14.518 --> 38:16.084
It proves
you killed her.

38:16.151 --> 38:19.117
I didn't kill
that bitch.

38:20.017 --> 38:21.017
Yeah, you did.

38:21.084 --> 38:22.418
You were angry
we robbed that john.

38:22.484 --> 38:24.484
You came, and you swg
that ashtray at her head.

38:24.550 --> 38:25.683
You would've done
the same thing to me

38:25.750 --> 38:27.084
If i hadn't
gotten out of there.

38:28.750 --> 38:29.884
She's gonna
transition.

38:29.950 --> 38:31.418
He hasn't admitted
to anything.
it's no good.

38:31.484 --> 38:33.717
If she slips into jessie
or r.j., we're done.

38:33.784 --> 38:35.317
She's gonna have no idea
what's going on.

38:35.384 --> 38:36.451
Sophie. sophie,
you're doin' fine.

38:36.518 --> 38:38.418
Hang in there.
hang in there.

38:40.284 --> 38:43.117
Sophie, you hear me?

38:43.184 --> 38:45.151
Sophie, are you there?!

38:51.817 --> 38:52.817
Sophie, he won't hurt you

38:52.884 --> 38:54.750
Till he knows
where that wallet is.

38:55.617 --> 38:57.151
Back off, trent.

38:58.418 --> 39:00.117
You'd better give me
that wallet.

39:01.051 --> 39:02.617
5 grand, it's yours.

39:02.683 --> 39:05.351
I don't have 5 grand.

39:06.518 --> 39:07.683
Too bad, then.

39:10.984 --> 39:13.917
I told
you and amber to stop
rolling johns in here.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.284
It was driving away
customers.

39:16.351 --> 39:20.084
I wouldn't have
done her if you
had behaved right.

39:20.151 --> 39:21.650
All right. we're good.
let's go.

39:21.717 --> 39:23.251
Run! get out of there!

39:25.484 --> 39:26.750
[tires skid]

39:27.617 --> 39:28.550
[grunts]

39:28.617 --> 39:30.184
No. no!

39:32.617 --> 39:33.784
Freeze!

39:41.184 --> 39:43.784
You did it.
you did it. you're ok.

39:43.850 --> 39:46.051
Thank you, sophie.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.418
You did good.
you did good.

39:49.451 --> 39:50.917
You did it.

39:58.550 --> 39:59.750
[knocks on door]

39:59.817 --> 40:02.184
Hey.

40:02.251 --> 40:03.583
Wow.

40:03.650 --> 40:05.484
Yeah.

40:06.550 --> 40:09.051
Cal, i'm sorry
it's happening like this.

40:09.117 --> 40:10.884
I really am.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.984
It's for your share
of the lightman group.
i'm buying you out.

40:24.051 --> 40:25.617
[sighs]

40:25.683 --> 40:27.051
Don't do this.

40:27.117 --> 40:28.217
You got it
in the divorce.

40:28.284 --> 40:29.784
It's your money.
you earned it.

40:32.650 --> 40:36.217
Look, 15 different ways
i come up with today.

40:37.984 --> 40:39.850
Uh, money just shows up.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.217
Opportunity
comes your way.

40:42.284 --> 40:43.850
Just one small con.

40:43.917 --> 40:46.317
All right, you'd've
been none the wiser.

40:46.384 --> 40:47.583
I would have seen
through that.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.850
You would have
suspected, but you
wouldn't have known.

40:52.184 --> 40:54.317
But this is
my daughter.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.418
Last couple of days,
i've been teacher,

40:58.484 --> 41:02.317
Boss, a colleague,
pal, bastard.

41:02.384 --> 41:05.784
Just suits you put on,
take off.

41:05.850 --> 41:08.184
What? so dad is
your favorite suit?

41:08.251 --> 41:11.484
No, that's the only one
that's not a suit.

41:15.384 --> 41:17.583
You can't afford this,

41:17.650 --> 41:19.518
And i have made
a commitment.

41:19.583 --> 41:21.384
Everything you
wanna do in chicago,

41:21.451 --> 41:24.884
You can right here,
except it'll be
your own firm.

41:26.550 --> 41:29.550
If you take
what's yours.

41:29.617 --> 41:32.583
I'm not saying
its not selfish. it is.

41:34.583 --> 41:37.184
But it's
the right thing for me.

41:38.583 --> 41:41.418
Also happens to be
the right thing for you

41:41.484 --> 41:42.850
And emily.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.550
In other news, it looks
as though the president

41:49.617 --> 41:51.518
Has made a decision for
a supreme court nomination.

41:51.583 --> 41:53.850
That's right, dan.
the president this morning...

41:53.917 --> 41:54.850
Good morning.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.750
Announcing his pick
for the opening

41:56.817 --> 41:57.984
On the supreme court.

41:58.051 --> 42:00.084
Judge william simon,
a moderate from ohio,

42:00.151 --> 42:02.418
Was considered a long shot
as late as last week.

42:02.484 --> 42:04.051
I hope he made
the right choice.

42:04.117 --> 42:05.784
He began his career
as a tough district attorney...

42:05.850 --> 42:08.650
I got a call
from the bank
first thing.

42:08.717 --> 42:11.583
They thought i should know
that the lightman group's loan
has been approved

42:11.650 --> 42:13.151
And the ownership shares
have been transferred.

42:13.217 --> 42:14.917
Yeah, i know.
i bought our way out.

42:14.984 --> 42:16.284
Did you consider

42:16.351 --> 42:19.683
Telling me,
your partner, about this
before you did it?

42:19.750 --> 42:22.351
Zoe was gonna take emily,
so i had to--

42:22.418 --> 42:24.717
Jeopardize the financial
future of this company?

42:24.784 --> 42:26.984
That's a bit dramatic,
isn't it?

42:27.051 --> 42:29.151
You know,
i--i lied earlier

42:29.217 --> 42:32.117
When i said
i was devastated
about the divorce.

42:32.184 --> 42:33.184
I'm not.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.017
You know, for the first
time in 5 years,

42:35.084 --> 42:36.451
When i get dressed
in the morning,

42:36.518 --> 42:39.484
I don't automatically
reach for black or brown
or navy blue.

42:39.550 --> 42:41.151
I'm wearing pink today,
cal, pink,

42:41.217 --> 42:43.284
Because i like pink.
it makes me happy,

42:43.351 --> 42:47.317
Which is something
that i have not been
for a very long time.

42:47.384 --> 42:50.151
I'm divorced,
and i'm free,
and i'm happy,

42:50.217 --> 42:53.017
And if you do something
to screw that up--

42:53.084 --> 42:54.384
I won't.

42:54.451 --> 42:56.518
I promise i won't.

42:59.317 --> 43:01.284
You know,
push comes to shove,

43:01.351 --> 43:03.518
I can always go to vegas,
make the money back, so...

43:03.583 --> 43:05.051
Wait. don't even
joke about that.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.384
Cal...

43:07.451 --> 43:10.351
Promise me you'll
never go back to vegas.
