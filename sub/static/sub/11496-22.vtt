I made up a fake name

I actually like you

A guy who once called

That's what they say.

18:56.202 --> 18:59.504
I'm sorry, alan. I-I at least
have to talk to him.

19:00.907 --> 19:04.775
It's times like this
a son needs his mother.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.345
I'm gonna slip out
the back.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.214
Serves you right,
you bastard.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.216
I mean, I love you.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.887
Let's work this out.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.356
Best wedding ever!

19:18.358 --> 19:20.625
Yep! And I got
the whole thing on...

19:20.627 --> 19:24.395
Aw, crap, I had it on photo.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.465
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

19:29.935 --> 19:31.669
How you doing?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.838
I've had better days.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.641
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.844
Later, I'll run
you a bublé bath.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.513
(chuckles)
thanks.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.248
Gretchen called.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.783
She said it's not over.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.186
She's just sorting things out.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.954
Oh, buddy.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.357
"sorting things out"
is just people's way

19:53.359 --> 19:55.760
Of not giving you bad news.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.430
So I take it your...

19:59.432 --> 20:03.367
Mom's not gonna give you the
money for your own place?

20:04.336 --> 20:07.471
I'm just sorting
things out.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.740
You know what?

20:09.742 --> 20:12.376
I didn't really want
you to leave anyway.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.445
Aw. Thanks.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.582
Can you believe it?

20:17.584 --> 20:20.718
We're still together,
three years later.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.286
I know.

20:22.288 --> 20:25.690
I thought for sure
it was over when charlie died.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.758
Thank god I showed up.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.964
You're telling me.
Hmm.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.966
I... You know,
I've been so busy lately.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.701
I-I really miss
hanging out with you.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.403
Yeah. Me, too. You know,
we should pick a night

20:39.405 --> 20:41.672
Where we just
always get together.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.875
No matter what's going on,
once a week, we just do this.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.711
Okay, I like it.
I like it.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.980
How 'bout, uh, here
every Thursday night?

20:48.982 --> 20:50.348
9:00.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.015
It's a date.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.750
Uh, don't call it a date.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.486
Just call it...
Two men hanging out.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.988
Robot:
Hey.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.923
What about me?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.592
Okay, fine.
Two and a half men.
