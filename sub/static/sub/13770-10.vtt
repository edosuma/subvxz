WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.128
So you can shoot

00:01.502 --> 00:03.128
free throws better than me.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.880
Fine. Whatever.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.880
Big deal.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.256
That's all

00:04.922 --> 00:06.256
you've got on me.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.049
Can you stop a ceiling

00:06.298 --> 00:08.049
fan with your head?

00:08.091 --> 00:09.927
I didn't think so.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.428
And look at this.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.555
My Popsicle's like

00:11.470 --> 00:13.555
twice the size of yours.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.640
What a score.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.724
I am totally...

00:15.766 --> 00:17.017
Reese.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.146
Oh.

Jamie, how can you

00:57.140 --> 00:59.894
enjoy this processed food?

00:59.935 --> 01:02.563
This is nothing like

00:59.935 --> 01:02.563
you'd eat out in the wild.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.939
I did it!

01:03.981 --> 01:05.524
I got my learner's permit.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.817
I can drive anywhere

01:05.566 --> 01:06.817
with an adult.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.109
And the adult does not

01:08.151 --> 01:09.110
have to be visible

01:08.151 --> 01:09.110
from the outside.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.779
I checked.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.406
Everyone taking the test

01:10.821 --> 01:12.406
was trying to copy off him.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.116
Wow, Mom's actually

01:13.156 --> 01:15.116
proud of me.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.160
It's kind of nice to finally

01:15.158 --> 01:17.160
have my moment in the...

01:17.202 --> 01:18.203
Dewey?!

01:18.245 --> 01:20.080
Oh, my God!

01:20.998 --> 01:22.791
Is this what

01:20.998 --> 01:22.791
it looks like?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.835
Yes, Mom.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.835
This is a friend.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.628
His name's Noah.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.130
Oh, Noah, it is such

01:26.670 --> 01:29.130
a pleasure to meet you.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.133
I can't tell you

01:29.172 --> 01:32.133
how thrilled I am...

01:32.175 --> 01:33.761
Mom.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.055
If we seem too excited,

01:33.802 --> 01:36.055
we're going to spook him.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.599
So as far as you're concerned,

01:36.095 --> 01:38.599
this is just another day.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.226
Come on, Noah.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.728
Dewey?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.187
(camera clicking)

01:44.229 --> 01:46.273
Okay, I'm done now.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.818
HAL:

01:48.358 --> 01:49.818
Honey, come on out here.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.278
I have

01:49.860 --> 01:51.278
a surprise for you.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.742
What is this?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.326
It's a hot tub, Lois.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.870
Are you out of your mind?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.455
We can't afford a hot tub.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.082
That's what I said, too,

02:03.123 --> 02:06.001
but then the sales guy

02:03.123 --> 02:06.001
showed me how wrong I was.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.210
Boys, get out here!

02:07.252 --> 02:10.047
Hal, I can't believe

02:07.252 --> 02:10.047
you did this without me.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.173
You know we always make these

02:10.089 --> 02:12.173
kinds of decisions together.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.009
It was an in-store promotion.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.803
We got 20% off

02:15.844 --> 02:17.638
on the spot.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.180
Plus a tub club card,

02:17.679 --> 02:19.180
plus free caulking.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.100
And that's where they kill you,

02:19.222 --> 02:21.100
Lois-- the caulking.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.183
Hal...

02:22.225 --> 02:22.893
MALCOLM:

02:22.225 --> 02:22.893
A hot tub.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.185
Sweet.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
This is just what

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
it's like here.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.356
We're always getting

02:26.271 --> 02:28.356
great stuff like hot tubs.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.357
Hal, you're taking it back.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.484
What about the boys?

02:30.525 --> 02:31.860
Don't they get a say in this?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.612
Yeah, Mom, it'll be great

02:33.654 --> 02:34.863
for entertaining.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.364
No, they do not get

02:34.905 --> 02:36.364
a say in this

02:36.406 --> 02:38.241
because we are

02:36.406 --> 02:38.241
not keeping it.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.285
Well, we're...

02:38.283 --> 02:40.285
kind of locked in.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.496
We're what?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.496
Lois, you

02:40.327 --> 02:42.496
don't get

02:42.537 --> 02:45.206
deals like this

02:42.537 --> 02:45.206
without making a commitment.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.584
It's zero

02:45.248 --> 02:47.584
percent interest.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.004
If you factor in inflation,

02:47.626 --> 02:50.004
it's almost like

02:50.045 --> 02:51.421
they're paying  us

02:50.045 --> 02:51.421
2,800 bucks.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.841
$2,800!

02:53.882 --> 02:55.592
I can't

02:53.882 --> 02:55.592
believe you!

02:55.634 --> 02:57.218
You went behind my back,

02:57.260 --> 02:58.887
you spent money you had

02:57.260 --> 02:58.887
no right to spend to buy a pile

02:58.929 --> 03:00.430
of lumber

02:58.929 --> 03:00.430
and tubes.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.932
Don't worry.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.101
It has very detailed

03:01.974 --> 03:04.101
assembly instructions,

03:04.143 --> 03:07.896
which I won't go anywhere near

03:04.143 --> 03:07.896
because Malcolm's doing it.

03:07.938 --> 03:08.772
I don't mind.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.327
The baby's head

03:20.283 --> 03:22.327
was in the sun.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.246
Otto, what are you doing?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.124
I am posting

03:25.288 --> 03:27.124
the new safety rules.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.877
There have been far

03:27.166 --> 03:29.877
too many senseless accidents.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.172
People will have

03:29.918 --> 03:33.172
no excuse not to be safe.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.589
(hammering)

03:39.970 --> 03:42.514
(hammering continues)

03:52.315 --> 03:54.401
(gasping)

03:56.820 --> 04:00.281
Francis! You wouldn't believe

03:56.820 --> 04:00.281
what happened-- I almost...

04:00.323 --> 04:02.242
(thunder cracks)

04:04.536 --> 04:06.121
Otto! Oh, my God!

04:06.163 --> 04:07.956
You okay?!

04:11.126 --> 04:13.754
Manfred Schmidt.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.590
Did I tell you?

04:16.631 --> 04:18.884
You just can't have

04:16.631 --> 04:18.884
a care in the world

04:18.926 --> 04:20.301
when you're in a hot tub.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.138
It's like a trip back

04:20.343 --> 04:23.138
to the old amniotic sac.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.472
(door opening)

04:24.514 --> 04:26.558
Jamie's going to be

04:24.514 --> 04:26.558
asleep for another hour.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.309
Do you think

04:26.600 --> 04:28.309
I could borrow your car

04:28.351 --> 04:29.895
for a quick trip

04:28.351 --> 04:29.895
to the Lucky Aide?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.521
I'll drive!

04:31.563 --> 04:33.314
Oh, no, I'll be

04:31.563 --> 04:33.314
fine, really.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.482
You all look

04:33.356 --> 04:34.482
so comfortable,

04:34.524 --> 04:35.525
and it's really

04:34.524 --> 04:35.525
just...

04:35.567 --> 04:36.484
Not a problem at all.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.819
I got the keys. Let's go!

04:40.363 --> 04:42.116
Honey, take a load off.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.324
No, thanks.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.576
Since now

04:43.366 --> 04:44.576
you've decided

04:44.618 --> 04:45.577
we're a family

04:44.618 --> 04:45.577
where everyone

04:45.619 --> 04:46.620
does whatever

04:45.619 --> 04:46.620
they want,

04:46.661 --> 04:47.621
what I want is to

04:47.662 --> 04:49.957
not be in the hot tub.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.333
These jets are great.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.710
I couldn't hear

04:52.375 --> 04:53.710
a word she said.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.628
(door closes)

04:54.669 --> 04:56.713
And if you

04:54.669 --> 04:56.713
really listen,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.715
everything has

04:56.755 --> 04:58.715
its own vibration.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.341
The trees and the grass...

05:00.383 --> 05:01.969
I mean, it's like

05:00.383 --> 05:01.969
the whole world

05:02.010 --> 05:03.178
is screaming sometimes.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.763
But you know, you can

05:03.220 --> 05:04.763
get one of those

05:04.805 --> 05:07.348
white noise machines

05:04.805 --> 05:07.348
and really crank it...

05:07.390 --> 05:08.516
Oh, stop here.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.810
What about the drugstore?

05:09.851 --> 05:11.352
I just need

05:09.851 --> 05:11.352
to grab something.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.360
This is cool. I get to drive.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.196
Plus, I got to know

05:19.402 --> 05:21.196
Polly a little bit better.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.365
It turns out she hasn't

05:21.238 --> 05:24.365
had a TV in 12 years,

05:24.407 --> 05:27.368
and instead of chemicals,

05:24.407 --> 05:27.368
her dry cleaner uses tea.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.371
Okay, but the driving

05:27.410 --> 05:30.371
is still cool.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.372
Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:30.413 --> 05:31.372
What?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.292
I said go!

05:33.333 --> 05:34.668
(tires squealing)

05:34.709 --> 05:35.836
(shrieks)

05:43.051 --> 05:44.636
What did you do?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.636
Malcolm, just give me

05:43.051 --> 05:44.636
a second to explain.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.013
I didn't

05:44.678 --> 05:46.013
do anything wrong.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.389
Trust me--

05:46.054 --> 05:48.389
we're not in any danger.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.058
Then take your foot off the gas!

05:52.227 --> 05:54.604
(panting)

05:54.646 --> 05:56.064
Okay, what

05:54.646 --> 05:56.064
did you take?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.107
What is that thing?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.317
This is mine.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.068
It belongs to me.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.071
My ex-boyfriend Danny took it

06:00.110 --> 06:03.071
and he wouldn't give it back,

06:03.113 --> 06:04.823
and this happens

06:03.113 --> 06:04.823
to be my mother.

06:04.865 --> 06:05.991
Your what?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.575
My mother's in here.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.575
Her ashes.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.410
I meant to get her a nicer urn,

06:09.452 --> 06:12.413
but they just raised my tuition

06:09.452 --> 06:12.413
at the Wicca School.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.791
So why couldn't you just

06:12.455 --> 06:14.791
ask the guy for the ashes?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.293
I don't think that would be

06:16.335 --> 06:18.003
a really good route

06:16.335 --> 06:18.003
to go with Danny.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.629
He's a very troubled man.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.632
What?

06:19.671 --> 06:22.632
Please don't tell

06:19.671 --> 06:22.632
your parents, okay?

06:22.674 --> 06:25.593
I need you to keep

06:22.674 --> 06:25.593
this between us, please?

06:25.635 --> 06:26.511
I love Jamie,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.222
and he loves me,

06:28.263 --> 06:30.640
and I'd be crushed

06:28.263 --> 06:30.640
if I couldn't see him.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.433
Literally.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.270
Emotions can

06:32.475 --> 06:35.270
compress organs, Malcolm.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.480
So can you help me out on this?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.482
Fine.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.318
This is weird.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.652
All I keep thinking is,

06:42.694 --> 06:45.655
it is so cool

06:42.694 --> 06:45.655
that I'm driving.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.699
Francis, have

06:45.697 --> 06:47.699
you seen Otto?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.076
What's the matter?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.952
I don't like letting

06:49.117 --> 06:50.952
him out of my sight.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.453
He's been

06:50.994 --> 06:52.453
so accident-prone.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.123
In the past few days,

06:52.495 --> 06:55.123
he smashed up both our cars.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.875
He keeps falling down

06:55.165 --> 06:56.875
the stairs.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.668
This morning,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.668
he set his hair on fire

06:58.710 --> 07:00.503
with his reading glasses.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.547
Gretchen, my love,

07:00.545 --> 07:02.547
I wonder if you can

07:02.589 --> 07:04.091
fetch the tweezers.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.927
I seem to have an

07:04.132 --> 07:06.927
ass-full of cactus.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.470
Otto, it was just

07:06.968 --> 07:09.470
beginning to heal.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.557
Well, I'm sorry. It's not like

07:09.512 --> 07:12.557
I'm doing this on purpose.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.892
Ooh...

07:13.934 --> 07:14.893
Francis, I'm afraid

07:14.935 --> 07:16.353
I'm doing this on purpose.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.478
What,

07:16.395 --> 07:17.478
hurting yourself?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.939
I don't know.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.939
It doesn't seem

07:18.980 --> 07:21.482
like all of these things

07:18.980 --> 07:21.482
could be accidents.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.068
It's like

07:21.524 --> 07:23.068
there is some

07:23.110 --> 07:25.987
subconscious drive to punish

07:23.110 --> 07:25.987
myself for some unknown...

07:26.029 --> 07:27.114
(screams)

07:27.155 --> 07:29.490
(straining)

07:29.532 --> 07:32.577
Otto, what does the name

07:29.532 --> 07:32.577
Manfred Schmidt mean to you?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.496
I haven't thought

07:32.619 --> 07:35.496
about him for years.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.666
I'm... oh, oh...

07:38.708 --> 07:39.960
What?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.796
Manfred Schmidt

07:40.001 --> 07:42.796
is Gretchen's fiancé.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.174
Well, he was, until I stole her.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.508
You stole Gretchen?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.510
He was my best friend,

07:49.552 --> 07:51.805
but I was in love

07:49.552 --> 07:51.805
with Gretchen, too.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.806
And on the day

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
they were going to elope,

07:54.557 --> 07:58.437
I told Manfred that

07:54.557 --> 07:58.437
Gretchen had already gone

07:58.478 --> 08:01.731
and that she would meet him

07:58.478 --> 08:01.731
at the train station in Berlin.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.024
Oh, Otto.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.943
Poor Gretchen stood

08:03.066 --> 08:04.943
in the rain for hours,

08:04.985 --> 08:05.986
devastated.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.321
And then

08:06.027 --> 08:07.321
I came along

08:07.362 --> 08:09.530
and I comforted her, and, uh,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
one thing led

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
to another thing, and, uh...

08:11.783 --> 08:15.620
well, here we are--

08:11.783 --> 08:15.620
25 years of perfect love...

08:15.662 --> 08:17.747
built on a lie.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.958
Otto, this is obviously

08:17.789 --> 08:19.958
tearing you up inside.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.336
Why don't you just call

08:20.000 --> 08:22.336
this guy and apologize

08:22.377 --> 08:24.421
before you really

08:22.377 --> 08:24.421
end up hurting yourself?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.047
Francis, I don't think

08:24.463 --> 08:26.047
I have the courage.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.466
Besides,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.843
now that I know

08:27.507 --> 08:29.843
what is behind it,

08:29.884 --> 08:32.387
maybe the problem will go away.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.307
Those are thumb tacks.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.143
DEWEY:

08:36.599 --> 08:38.143
Dad.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.395
Noah and I were supposed

08:38.185 --> 08:40.395
to play together,

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
but when I got

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
to his house,

08:41.896 --> 08:43.482
he wasn't there.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.984
I waited for an hour,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.984
but he never showed up.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.568
Don't be so negative.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.489
Maybe he got hurt and was

08:47.610 --> 08:50.489
taken to the hospital,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.407
or maybe

08:50.530 --> 08:52.407
his grandmother died.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.828
NOAH:

08:54.617 --> 08:56.828
...and then my guy

08:54.617 --> 08:56.828
parachutes in

08:56.870 --> 08:58.621
and shoots your guy.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.621
(imitates gunfire)

08:58.663 --> 09:00.081
Oh! I'm cold!

09:00.123 --> 09:01.582
I'm so cold!

09:01.624 --> 09:03.001
(laughing)

09:04.627 --> 09:05.586
LOIS:

09:04.627 --> 09:05.586
Oh, come on, Jamie.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.796
Here comes the airplane.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.089
Come on, say "ah."

09:08.131 --> 09:09.590
Boy, you know,

09:08.131 --> 09:09.590
I think the tension

09:09.632 --> 09:11.510
in my neck

09:09.632 --> 09:11.510
was dulling my taste buds.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.802
These hamburgers

09:11.551 --> 09:12.802
are amazing, honey.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.012
Well, thank you.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.430
And even with the cheese,

09:15.472 --> 09:17.307
it came in for less

09:15.472 --> 09:17.307
than $2,800.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.017
Who has the mustard?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.311
I don't know.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.311
Maybe Reese stole it.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.063
Like he steals everything.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
Well, maybe the mustard

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
likes me better.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.192
Maybe the mustard

09:25.023 --> 09:27.192
and I have more fun.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.860
You totally stole Noah from me!

09:28.902 --> 09:31.405
Whoa, you can't just

09:28.902 --> 09:31.405
change subjects on me.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.240
We were talking

09:31.446 --> 09:33.240
about mustard.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.615
I was talking about Noah.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.617
Oh, man, what

09:34.657 --> 09:36.617
a great kid.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.495
It's like having a little

09:36.659 --> 09:38.495
brother, you know?

09:38.537 --> 09:40.121
He was so proud

09:38.537 --> 09:40.121
of me when I

09:40.163 --> 09:42.249
beat the crap out of

09:40.163 --> 09:42.249
Craig Jansen for him.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.708
It was a nice moment.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.127
LOIS: Malcolm, how

09:43.750 --> 09:46.127
was your drive today?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.127
Fine.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.422
Just went to the Lucky Aide

09:46.169 --> 09:48.422
and back, that's it, huh?

09:48.463 --> 09:49.256
Yeah.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.631
LOIS:

09:49.297 --> 09:50.631
The Lucky Aide

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
is only two and a half

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
miles each way,

09:52.675 --> 09:55.720
yet the odometer mysteriously

09:52.675 --> 09:55.720
gained 23 miles.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.016
Okay, well, after

09:57.680 --> 10:00.016
I dropped Polly off,

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
I took the car by

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
myself. I'm sorry.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.644
I was just so excited,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.064
and I wanted to show off,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.064
so I drove around the mall.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.899
Well, thank you

10:06.106 --> 10:07.899
for being honest with me.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.360
Now give me the permit.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.736
What?!

10:10.402 --> 10:11.736
Two months

10:10.402 --> 10:11.736
without driving.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.946
But, Mom...

10:12.987 --> 10:14.114
Because you were

10:12.987 --> 10:14.114
honest with me,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.490
I'm not going to

10:14.155 --> 10:15.490
wad this up

10:15.532 --> 10:16.575
and throw it down

10:15.532 --> 10:16.575
the garbage disposal.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.700
That's so unfair! Dad?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.369
Malcolm, you know

10:17.742 --> 10:19.369
I always agree

10:19.411 --> 10:21.121
with your mother.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.332
Whether or not she holds herself

10:21.162 --> 10:24.332
to the same standard.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.881
(groaning)

10:43.768 --> 10:45.686
That's it!

10:45.728 --> 10:49.316
I'm sick of all the noise

10:45.728 --> 10:49.316
around here. Everybody out!

10:49.357 --> 10:51.568
Hal, you're taking the boys

10:49.357 --> 10:51.568
to the movies, now!

10:51.610 --> 10:54.195
Everybody up.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.195
Let's go, let's go!

10:55.614 --> 10:57.198
(car approaching)

10:57.240 --> 10:58.950
(car stops)

10:58.992 --> 11:01.702
(car doors opening and closing)

11:01.744 --> 11:03.163
HAL:

11:01.744 --> 11:03.163
Well, I didn't

11:01.744 --> 11:03.163
know the movie

11:03.204 --> 11:04.414
was going to

11:03.204 --> 11:04.414
be sold out.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.957
I'll get the paper.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.376
I didn't want to see

11:05.999 --> 11:08.376
the dog movie anyway.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.087
Well, whatever we see,

11:08.418 --> 11:11.087
I have to be back by 7:00.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.548
Me and Noah are

11:11.129 --> 11:13.548
ambushing Kevin Teevens.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.925
Another one?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.925
What are you, his enforcer?

11:15.967 --> 11:17.718
It's called being a friend.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.887
Okay, what do you boys

11:17.760 --> 11:19.887
want to see?

11:19.929 --> 11:23.183
I don't care. The real fun

11:19.929 --> 11:23.183
is being driven there by my dad.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.184
Come on.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.726
Hey, what about

11:24.225 --> 11:25.726
this one?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.686
There's a review

11:25.768 --> 11:27.686
right here.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.001
Sounds good.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.710
Let's go.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.469
Ah. (chuckles)

11:59.511 --> 12:01.388
(car doors closing)

12:01.429 --> 12:03.682
(engine starts, car drives away)

12:03.722 --> 12:05.308
(gasping)

12:13.816 --> 12:18.279
Well, he's missing out

12:13.816 --> 12:18.279
on a great cardio workout.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.280
(grunts)

12:19.322 --> 12:20.574
(panting)

12:20.615 --> 12:21.824
Malcolm, right?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.784
Who are you?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.784
My name is Danny.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.286
I believe

12:23.826 --> 12:25.286
you took something

12:25.328 --> 12:27.622
that belongs to me.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.588
What, did you think

12:32.960 --> 12:34.588
I wouldn't find you?

12:34.629 --> 12:35.922
Do you think you could

12:34.629 --> 12:35.922
get away with this?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.507
Do you think I'm stupid?

12:37.549 --> 12:39.092
Do you think

12:37.549 --> 12:39.092
this is fun for me?!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.386
I don't know what

12:39.133 --> 12:41.386
question to answer.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.098
Aah! Sinus headache.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.807
The pain makes me furious,

12:46.849 --> 12:48.518
and the fury makes it

12:46.849 --> 12:48.518
more painful,

12:48.560 --> 12:51.521
and then you just black out

12:48.560 --> 12:51.521
and you don't know what you did.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.689
How can I help you?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.482
I want the urn

12:52.731 --> 12:54.482
that Polly took.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.067
You want her

12:54.524 --> 12:56.067
mother's ashes?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.861
She told you

12:56.109 --> 12:58.861
her mother's in there?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.821
My father's in there.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.617
My father, who I loved,

13:03.658 --> 13:06.119
who went cold-turkey

13:03.658 --> 13:06.119
for my graduation.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.496
That's whose ashes

13:06.160 --> 13:08.496
are in there.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.207
Oh. Well...

13:08.538 --> 13:11.207
You are going to

13:08.538 --> 13:11.207
give me that urn.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.084
I know where you live.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.877
So listen up.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.464
I'm going to go get

13:14.919 --> 13:17.464
an allergy shot.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.839
And right after that,

13:18.881 --> 13:21.468
I'm coming over to your house

13:18.881 --> 13:21.468
for the ashes.

13:24.887 --> 13:28.141
Well, look at the giant

13:24.887 --> 13:28.141
surprise that happened here.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.643
You want to tell me

13:29.684 --> 13:31.227
this wasn't a huge

13:29.684 --> 13:31.227
waste of money now?

13:31.269 --> 13:33.647
Every tub has

13:31.269 --> 13:33.647
a break-in period.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.940
It's just adjusting

13:33.688 --> 13:35.940
to our natural body chemistry.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.485
There's a six-inch

13:35.982 --> 13:38.485
crust of algae.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.528
The tub is fine.

13:49.912 --> 13:54.626
See? Absolutely perfect.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.885
You lied to me.

14:04.927 --> 14:05.886
What do you mean?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
I just met Danny,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
and he says

14:07.430 --> 14:09.098
his father's ashes

14:07.430 --> 14:09.098
are in that urn.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.475
Well, yes, they are.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.892
So you lied.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.312
No, the truth is, it's

14:11.934 --> 14:14.312
my mother's ashes,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.815
his father's ashes,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.815
the springer spaniel

14:16.897 --> 14:18.941
that we bought together and

14:16.897 --> 14:18.941
a cat I had before I met him.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.944
What?!

14:18.983 --> 14:21.944
You know how when you

14:18.983 --> 14:21.944
move in with somebody,

14:21.986 --> 14:24.905
you-you mix up your

14:21.986 --> 14:24.905
plates and your CDs...

14:24.947 --> 14:27.992
Look, he was acting

14:24.947 --> 14:27.992
really, really scary.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.203
Like psycho dangerous scary.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.163
Just tell me,

14:30.244 --> 14:32.163
do I need to be worried?

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
Oh, no. No.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.500
Yes.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.335
Oh, God. All right.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.379
I've got to think.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.589
I'll think of something.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.801
I couldn't think of anything.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.887
We're out of the city;

14:44.843 --> 14:47.887
you can turn on the headlights.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.431
Okay, his plane

14:48.971 --> 14:50.431
landed an hour ago.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.808
He should be

14:50.473 --> 14:51.808
here any minute.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.184
Manfred Schmidt.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.935
What if the fire

14:53.226 --> 14:54.935
is still there

14:54.977 --> 14:56.103
between him and Gretchen?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.564
Come on, Otto,

14:57.605 --> 14:59.023
you know how much

14:57.605 --> 14:59.023
Gretchen loves you.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.860
I can do this.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.070
I will go get Gretchen.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.950
Thank you very much.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.452
Uh, please...

15:11.494 --> 15:12.871
make sure my chef

15:11.494 --> 15:12.871
finds the kitchen.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.455
Mr. Schmidt, welcome.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.956
Did you have

15:14.497 --> 15:15.956
a nice flight?

15:15.998 --> 15:17.542
Ah, yes, thanks.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.959
When you fly your own jet,

15:19.001 --> 15:21.379
it always makes the time

15:19.001 --> 15:21.379
go so much faster.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.215
Uh, did your wife

15:21.421 --> 15:24.215
come with you?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
Oh, I never married.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.344
After Gretchen broke my heart,

15:25.800 --> 15:28.344
I just couldn't.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.180
Every day I think

15:28.386 --> 15:31.180
of what might have been,

15:31.222 --> 15:34.975
and now-- thanks to you--

15:31.222 --> 15:34.975
what still could be.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.896
Do you think she likes

15:35.017 --> 15:37.896
giant diamonds?

15:39.313 --> 15:43.067
Uh... look, there's been

15:39.313 --> 15:43.067
a change in plans.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.778
Gretchen isn't here.

15:44.819 --> 15:45.986
I'm afraid she stood you up.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.988
What?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.988
She said she

15:46.028 --> 15:47.988
wasn't interested.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.783
And then she disappeared.

15:49.824 --> 15:50.867
Tough break.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.993
I don't believe you.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.993
Seriously.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.621
You know how flighty

15:53.035 --> 15:54.621
Gretchen can be.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.247
I didn't come

15:54.662 --> 15:56.247
all the way from Germany

15:56.289 --> 15:59.083
to be turned away

15:56.289 --> 15:59.083
by some messenger boy.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.920
I'm not leaving

15:59.125 --> 16:01.920
until I see Gretchen.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.227
Otto, why are you

16:15.057 --> 16:18.227
being so mysterious?

16:18.269 --> 16:20.814
What is this big

16:18.269 --> 16:20.814
terrible secret?

16:20.855 --> 16:21.898
Well...

16:21.940 --> 16:24.734
(explosion)

16:24.776 --> 16:29.113
Otto paid way too much

16:24.776 --> 16:29.113
for these earrings.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.531
Oh, Otto.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.451
Okay, my mom says

16:30.573 --> 16:33.451
I can stay for dinner.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.243
Cool.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.453
Oh, Dewey.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.830
Noah's going to need

16:35.495 --> 16:36.830
your chair.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.039
He's not your friend, Reese.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.334
Noah just made friends with me

16:39.081 --> 16:41.334
to get to you.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.044
And he's just using you

16:41.375 --> 16:44.044
to beat people up for him.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.755
Reese, take him out.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.465
No, listen.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.050
Last week, three kids

16:47.507 --> 16:50.050
beat the crap out of him.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.053
He's not tough enough to get

16:50.092 --> 16:53.053
them back, but you are.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.305
You already paid back

16:54.347 --> 16:56.056
Kevin Teevens and Craig Jansen.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
All that's left

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
is Todd Lemmon,

16:58.100 --> 17:01.521
and I took care of him myself.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.439
Here's a piece of his T-shirt.

17:03.481 --> 17:07.067
Here's his retainer with part

17:03.481 --> 17:07.067
of a tooth still on it.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.320
And here's my four-day

17:07.109 --> 17:09.320
suspension slip.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.155
Wow.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.991
You really nailed him.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.035
Thanks, Dewey.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.035
Go to hell, Reese.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
Wait. So it's just over?

17:19.121 --> 17:22.542
Is that all I was to you,

17:19.121 --> 17:22.542
a couple of fists?

17:22.583 --> 17:27.087
I have some guys you

17:22.583 --> 17:27.087
can beat up for me.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.882
It's too soon.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.092
Are you positive Danny

17:28.923 --> 17:32.092
won't go to our house?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.511
I told him specifically

17:33.553 --> 17:35.596
that he wouldn't find us

17:33.553 --> 17:35.596
or the ashes there.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.391
I just hope

17:35.638 --> 17:38.391
he checks his messages.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.976
Danny's not home!

17:40.018 --> 17:42.311
(screaming)

17:42.353 --> 17:44.313
That doesn't work

17:42.353 --> 17:44.313
when he's in the car!

17:44.355 --> 17:45.857
Let go! Let go!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.609
What are you doing here?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.110
I'm here to get what's mine.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
You had no right to

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
take my father from me!

17:51.654 --> 17:52.906
Oh, your "father"? Please.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.156
When he was sick,

17:52.947 --> 17:54.156
you made him live

17:54.198 --> 17:56.116
in a junked-out car

17:54.198 --> 17:56.116
in the backyard.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.493
That was a Le Sabre!

17:57.535 --> 17:59.119
Do you hear the way

17:57.535 --> 17:59.119
she talks to me?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.162
I'm just driving.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.789
We had an agreement.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.958
We said the ashes would stay

18:01.831 --> 18:03.958
right by the coffeemaker

18:04.000 --> 18:06.126
and we'd all be

18:04.000 --> 18:06.126
together. Forever.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
You and me

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
and our dead ancestors and pets.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.590
Then one day I come home

18:08.170 --> 18:10.590
from drum circle

18:10.631 --> 18:13.384
and you're gone

18:10.631 --> 18:13.384
without even saying good-bye!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.135
Danny, you're the one

18:15.177 --> 18:16.637
who violated the agreement,

18:16.679 --> 18:19.139
because you had to dominate

18:16.679 --> 18:19.139
every moment

18:19.181 --> 18:20.850
of my life.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.142
You even had

18:20.892 --> 18:22.142
to cut my hair.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.519
And I don't like bangs!

18:23.561 --> 18:26.940
Are you insane?

18:23.561 --> 18:26.940
With your bone structure, you...

18:26.981 --> 18:28.148
Never mind.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.525
You're not taking my father.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.568
You can't have my mother.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.152
Give me the ashes.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.780
I will not!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
What are you do...?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
Aah!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
Malcolm!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.533
(yelling)

18:35.782 --> 18:37.533
No!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.533
(horn blows)

18:37.575 --> 18:39.035
(cries):

18:37.575 --> 18:39.035
Oh!

18:39.077 --> 18:41.161
I have heard enough of this.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.581
I am sick of you people

18:41.203 --> 18:43.581
screaming about the ashes

18:43.623 --> 18:46.166
when it's clearly

18:43.623 --> 18:46.166
not about the ashes.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.168
It's not?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.168
I think it is.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.046
The problem

18:48.210 --> 18:50.046
is your relationship.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.798
And you're never

18:50.088 --> 18:51.798
going to get past it

18:51.839 --> 18:55.134
unless you start talking to

18:51.839 --> 18:55.134
each other like human beings.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.766
I-I guess I freaked out...

19:01.808 --> 19:06.562
when you left me without

19:01.808 --> 19:06.562
even saying good-bye.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.064
I'm sorry about that.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.900
We both know

19:08.106 --> 19:10.900
it had to end.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.861
I just couldn't face

19:10.942 --> 19:13.861
hurting you.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.114
You deserved better

19:13.903 --> 19:16.114
from me.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.365
Thank you.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.993
You're welcome.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.496
So if, uh, there's nobody else

19:20.034 --> 19:23.496
back there,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.206
I'm just gonna turn around

19:23.537 --> 19:26.206
and go home.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.208
You're a heart healer,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.208
Malcolm.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.252
I'm pretty sure

19:28.250 --> 19:30.252
it's too late for you now,

19:30.294 --> 19:33.965
but in the next life,

19:30.294 --> 19:33.965
you're gonna really cash in.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.890
I have to say, I've only

19:39.428 --> 19:42.890
ever seen this on boats.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.726
I'm gonna have to make

19:42.932 --> 19:45.726
some phone calls on this one.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.775
Go ahead and say it.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.775
I know you're dying to.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.655
Why do I always

19:54.276 --> 19:57.655
have to be the fun killer?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.239
What are you talking about?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.492
Do you know what it's like

19:59.281 --> 20:01.492
to be the person

20:01.534 --> 20:04.871
in charge of saying "no"

20:01.534 --> 20:04.871
all the time?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
I hate it.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.249
Honey, we depend

20:06.288 --> 20:09.249
on you for that.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.502
You're the one who keeps

20:09.291 --> 20:11.502
us from killing ourselves.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.254
Yes, but all I ever hear

20:11.544 --> 20:14.254
is "Why can't we?"

20:14.296 --> 20:16.716
and "You never let us."

20:16.757 --> 20:19.719
Just once can't I

20:16.757 --> 20:19.719
be the person

20:19.760 --> 20:22.429
who gets to have

20:19.760 --> 20:22.429
the fun, crazy idea?

20:22.471 --> 20:25.975
You know what?

20:22.471 --> 20:25.975
Absolutely.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.267
Go ahead.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.562
What do you have in mind?

20:31.147 --> 20:34.108
Well, I can't come up with

20:31.147 --> 20:34.108
something just on the spot.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.194
Okay. This should stunt

20:34.150 --> 20:36.194
the algae growth.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.362
This should burn off

20:36.235 --> 20:38.362
your outer layer of skin.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.280
And these pills

20:38.404 --> 20:40.280
will gradually kill

20:40.322 --> 20:42.241
what's lodged

20:40.322 --> 20:42.241
in your urethra.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
It was a kidnapping situation

20:47.329 --> 20:48.956
and it wasn't

20:47.329 --> 20:48.956
our fault...

20:48.998 --> 20:50.290
Where's Mom and Dad?

20:50.332 --> 20:51.751
They're not home yet.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.293
Oh, my God, this is fate.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.545
We said "knock, knock."

20:54.587 --> 20:57.131
And this is the universe

20:54.587 --> 20:57.131
saying, "Who's there?"

20:57.173 --> 21:00.259
If they ask, I was

20:57.173 --> 21:00.259
here all night.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.386
Oh, boys,

21:02.428 --> 21:04.680
your mom has

21:02.428 --> 21:04.680
a really crazy idea

21:04.722 --> 21:06.933
she wants to run by you.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.933
Probably too crazy.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.935
Lois?

21:08.976 --> 21:12.271
We are going to have ice

21:08.976 --> 21:12.271
cream on the good china.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.151
Wow, that's crazy.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.151
Oh, cool.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.151
Are you sure?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.778
I told you!

21:17.193 --> 21:18.778
Wow.
