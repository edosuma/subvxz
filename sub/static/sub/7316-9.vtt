WEBVTT

00:04.913 --> 00:07.347
METEOROLOGIST: Washington, DC,
hasn't seen snow like this

00:07.391 --> 00:09.304
for Thanksgiving in decades.

00:09.347 --> 00:13.043
The roads are slick,
and visibility is near zero.

00:13.086 --> 00:16.000
A bitterly cold windchill
makes our nation's capital

00:16.043 --> 00:19.000
feel more like
the frozen Arctic.

00:19.043 --> 00:20.478
What caused the shift
in temperatures

00:20.521 --> 00:22.782
is this high-pressure system
that you can see...

00:22.826 --> 00:24.652
I've flown in worse, honey.

00:24.695 --> 00:27.434
Paris. Yeah.
Quick there and back.

00:27.478 --> 00:31.043
No leftovers-- I will be there
to cut the turkey.

00:31.086 --> 00:33.043
[quietly]:
I know, I know.

00:33.086 --> 00:35.608
[knocking on door]There's my cab.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.608
Love you.

00:37.652 --> 00:39.782
[weather broadcast continues]

00:39.826 --> 00:42.391
I'll just be
another minute.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.695
[silenced gunfire]

00:45.739 --> 00:49.043
[on TV]: ...in Fairfax, not much
better, and along the coast,

00:49.086 --> 00:52.521
our coldest temperatures, as
we will dip down into the teens.

00:52.565 --> 00:56.043
The forecast of scattered
showers in some areas

00:56.086 --> 00:58.521
was quickly turned
into the wet, icy accumulation

00:58.565 --> 01:00.826
that we are seeing
out there right now.

01:00.869 --> 01:03.739
So, let's go ahead and take a
look at our local temperatures.

01:03.782 --> 01:07.086
Now, in DC, we can expect lows
into the 20s.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.956
In Fairfax, not much better,
and along the coast,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.217
our coldest temperatures, as we
will dip down into the teens.

01:14.260 --> 01:17.391
This could let up at any time,
but for the moment,

01:17.434 --> 01:19.086
we can expect

01:19.130 --> 01:22.043
one rough
Thanksgiving weekend ahead.

01:53.086 --> 01:54.043
METEOROLOGIST: Let's go ahead
and take a look

01:54.086 --> 01:55.608
at our local temperatures...

01:55.652 --> 01:58.260
Somehow a "White Thanksgiving"
never sounds quite right.

01:58.304 --> 02:00.043
BISHOP:
Tell me about it.

02:00.086 --> 02:03.043
Yesterday youwere calling
this a "chance of rain."

02:03.086 --> 02:06.000
ABBY: Is he here yet?
Is he here yet? Did I miss him?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.739
I just hung up with him, Abbs--
he's getting on

02:07.782 --> 02:08.869
the elevator.

02:08.913 --> 02:10.391
One very fast elevator.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.739
[gentle laugh]

02:11.782 --> 02:13.130
Hey.

02:13.173 --> 02:15.043
Ellie, he's adorable.

02:15.086 --> 02:16.217
Aw, thanks.
[laughs]

02:16.260 --> 02:19.739
Jake Malloy,
this is the amazing Abby.

02:19.782 --> 02:23.347
Oh. Uh, I-I could've guessed.ABBY: Hi.

02:23.391 --> 02:25.217
And this is McGee.
Tim McGee.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.391
Tim. Of course.

02:26.434 --> 02:28.086
Ellie's been singing
your praises all year.

02:28.130 --> 02:30.478
It's great to finally
meet you both.

02:30.521 --> 02:32.043
Emphasis on "finally."

02:32.086 --> 02:33.826
Yeah. I know.
Um, I'm sorry again, Abby,

02:33.869 --> 02:36.086
about missing
your Halloween party.

02:36.130 --> 02:38.217
Oh, that's okay--
I'm sure you had some...

02:38.260 --> 02:40.434
super big, top secret
emergency NSA meeting

02:40.478 --> 02:42.086
that you couldn't miss.

02:42.130 --> 02:44.217
Uh, we were being
audited, actually.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.826
But yes-- once again,

02:45.869 --> 02:47.739
my job forced a last-minute
change of plans.

02:47.782 --> 02:49.913
But not tonight.

02:49.956 --> 02:50.826
No.

02:50.869 --> 02:51.652
We are spending the holiday

02:51.695 --> 02:53.086
in Turks and Caicos

02:53.130 --> 02:55.217
with Jake's family,
no matter what.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.217
You better get going, then.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.304
Gibbs. This is...

02:58.347 --> 02:59.913
Jake, yeah.
How you doing?Gibbs.

02:59.956 --> 03:01.782
Wow. I'm good.

03:01.826 --> 03:03.739
Um, listen, I can't
thank you enough

03:03.782 --> 03:06.043
for what you've meant
to Ellie this past year.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.347
All of you.

03:07.391 --> 03:08.521
She's earned it.

03:08.565 --> 03:10.695
Turks, huh?

03:10.739 --> 03:12.913
Turks for Turkey Day. Yeah.

03:12.956 --> 03:14.913
Uh, the country Turkey
might have been

03:14.956 --> 03:17.391
a little too on the nose.
[chuckles]

03:17.434 --> 03:18.521
[Bishop chuckles]

03:18.565 --> 03:19.956
[both chuckling]

03:22.086 --> 03:23.652
Uh, well, Gibbs is right--

03:23.695 --> 03:25.652
we should get going. Yeah.JAKE: Yeah, we should.

03:25.695 --> 03:28.695
6:30 flight out of Dulles.

03:28.739 --> 03:30.521
Tony should be into Dulles
about now.

03:30.565 --> 03:32.652
DiNozzo-- that's
who's missing.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.391
His father's flying in
from London.

03:34.434 --> 03:35.869
Maybe you'll see him there.Or maybe not.

03:35.913 --> 03:37.521
Airport's gonna be nuts.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.739
Actually, I'm thinking the snow
might thin the crowds a little.

03:39.782 --> 03:41.043
All right, well,
we'll see you guys.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.000
Nice meeting you.

03:46.347 --> 03:49.913
[indistinct radio communication]

03:49.956 --> 03:51.347
MAN [over P.A.]:
Your attention please--

03:51.391 --> 03:53.695
Do not leave
any baggage unattended...

03:53.739 --> 03:54.869
[jet taking off outside]

03:54.913 --> 03:56.434
JAKE:
Are you sure I was okay?

03:56.478 --> 03:58.434
You heard Abby--
you were adorable.

03:58.478 --> 04:00.695
But that Gibbs--
I was babbling away

04:00.739 --> 04:04.000
about Turkey, and he's just
looking at me with that look.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.130
The Gibbs look.
Hello?

04:06.173 --> 04:08.869
Did you think I was
making it up? [laughs]

04:08.913 --> 04:10.086
You were great.

04:10.130 --> 04:11.304
Really.

04:11.347 --> 04:13.434
[laughs]

04:13.478 --> 04:14.869
You okay?

04:14.913 --> 04:17.043
You seem on edge lately.

04:17.086 --> 04:18.913
The flight?No, no.

04:18.956 --> 04:20.521
I'm good flying.Okay.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.956
Just, um, I don't know,
the holidays, I guess.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.826
I'm fine.Okay.

04:24.869 --> 04:27.869
We are so overdue
for this.Ah.

04:27.913 --> 04:31.826
Sun, sand, warm,
blue water... [laughs]

04:31.869 --> 04:33.826
It's not as warm as you'd
think this time of year.

04:33.869 --> 04:35.478
[gasp] Tony!

04:35.521 --> 04:37.739
I thought I was
gonna be stuck

04:37.782 --> 04:39.739
all by my lonesome
when they announced

04:39.782 --> 04:41.826
Dad's flight took off late,
when what should appear

04:41.869 --> 04:44.043
but a Thanksgiving miracle!

04:44.086 --> 04:45.521
Agent DiNozzo, I presume?

04:45.565 --> 04:46.869
The elusive Jake.

04:46.913 --> 04:48.956
It's nice to know Bishop
hasn't been catfishing us

04:49.000 --> 04:50.826
all year--
I was starting to wonder.

04:50.869 --> 04:52.826
Well, you can stop
wondering, Tony.

04:52.869 --> 04:55.608
As you can see,
Jake is quite real.

04:55.652 --> 04:57.521
Unless he's a hologram
that can shake hands.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.956
NSA's actually working on one of
those-- I've seen the prototype.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.826
[laughs]:
Yeah, that'd be pretty fun.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.130
[chuckles]

05:03.173 --> 05:04.347
Really?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.956
No.
[laughs]

05:06.000 --> 05:07.304
Ah. Aha.

05:07.347 --> 05:08.913
Had me
for a second.

05:08.956 --> 05:10.739
That's too bad-- 'cause
I'd like one of those.

05:10.782 --> 05:12.260
I like him.
He's quick.

05:12.304 --> 05:14.782
Hey, speaking of quick, how'd
you get all the way up here?

05:14.826 --> 05:16.913
Arrival pickups never
get past Customs.

05:16.956 --> 05:19.739
It's all about the badge,
Bish-- you got to know
how to flash it.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.913
Oh. Oh, my.

05:24.956 --> 05:26.478
[sniffing]
The classic Smelly Guy.

05:26.521 --> 05:28.695
Yet another vivid hue
in the broad spectrum

05:28.739 --> 05:31.782
of airport humanity.Did he come straight
from the gym?

05:31.826 --> 05:33.782
Two gyms and a cheese shop.

05:36.956 --> 05:38.956
BISHOP:
And he's going to Turks.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.521
12C?

05:40.565 --> 05:42.478
Oh, my God,
we're 12A and B.

05:42.521 --> 05:43.869
Oh, we'll be fine.

05:43.913 --> 05:45.869
No. You'll die.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.652
Would it be awful
to change seats?Not as awful

05:48.695 --> 05:50.869
as composting right before
you come to the airport.

05:50.913 --> 05:53.478
Ugh! Okay, wish me luck.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.739
Jake, real quick.

05:54.782 --> 05:56.217
The metabolism--

05:56.260 --> 05:57.826
how does she eat like that?

05:59.304 --> 06:02.913
[indistinct flight
announcements over P.A.]

06:02.956 --> 06:05.434
Pretty, isn't it?

06:05.478 --> 06:06.739
Uh, oh.

06:06.782 --> 06:08.347
[laughs]:
Yes, dear.

06:08.391 --> 06:10.739
It's just lovely, mm-hmm.

06:10.782 --> 06:11.869
It's lovely how

06:11.913 --> 06:14.217
it turned a one-hour drive
into three,

06:14.260 --> 06:15.565
soaked a brand-new pair

06:15.608 --> 06:18.043
of my shoes
right down to the toes.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.217
Yeah.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.347
Simply spectacular.Well,

06:21.391 --> 06:24.043
at least we'll be getting away
from it for the holiday.

06:24.086 --> 06:26.826
I'm going to Calgary.

06:26.869 --> 06:29.347
WOMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:29.391 --> 06:31.043
due to the unexpected
weather conditions,

06:31.086 --> 06:33.086
all incoming
and outgoing flights

06:33.130 --> 06:35.043
are being
temporarily delayed.

06:35.086 --> 06:37.652
Every effort is being made
to clear the runways,

06:37.695 --> 06:39.173
but until
the snow lets up,

06:39.217 --> 06:42.000
everyone get comfortable--
could be an hour...

06:42.043 --> 06:43.739
could be more.

06:43.782 --> 06:46.956
[passengers murmuring, moaning]

06:47.000 --> 06:49.521
Ooh. Excuse me.

06:51.173 --> 06:53.565
Hey, I said excuse me.Yeah, I heard you.

06:53.608 --> 06:55.043
Is there a problem, sir?

06:55.086 --> 06:57.000
I don't know. Is there?

06:57.043 --> 06:58.869
I heard my wife say
"excuse me" just now.

06:58.913 --> 07:01.130
Doesn't that get
an "excuse me" in return?

07:01.173 --> 07:02.565
It's all right, Jake.

07:02.608 --> 07:04.521
Some people just have
better manners than others.

07:04.565 --> 07:07.130
That's okay, miss--
your husband's right.

07:07.173 --> 07:09.130
My bad.

07:10.739 --> 07:12.304
Forget it, Jake.

07:12.347 --> 07:14.260
It's Chinatown.

07:14.304 --> 07:16.521
Your name's Jake--
you never heard that?

07:16.565 --> 07:18.913
All my life, Mr. Mulwray.[laughs]

07:18.956 --> 07:20.347
You okay?

07:20.391 --> 07:22.347
Fine. You didn't have to.

07:22.391 --> 07:25.043
No, I... kind of did.Do we know that guy

07:25.086 --> 07:26.695
from somewhere?

07:26.739 --> 07:28.652
There's something
about him.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.826
I've never seen him before.

07:30.869 --> 07:32.782
Like... from
our supermarket?

07:32.826 --> 07:35.000
Maybe we go to the
same dry cleaner?

07:35.043 --> 07:36.869
Well, while you keep guessing,
why don't I go see

07:36.913 --> 07:38.782
if we can switch
these seats, huh?All right.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.652
All right.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.086
Could we know him
from work?

07:46.130 --> 07:48.000
[speaking quietly]TONY: All I know is,
flight delays

07:48.043 --> 07:50.434
make nice people cranky
and cranky people crankier.

07:50.478 --> 07:53.695
Well, he obviously falls
under the latter category.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.521
[quietly]: ...that's not how
I do things, understand?

07:56.565 --> 07:59.782
Yeah. Definitely the latter.

07:59.826 --> 08:02.608
How do I know that guy?

08:15.826 --> 08:19.913
So, anyway, there I was,
still trying to be cool
on my second day at NSA.

08:19.956 --> 08:21.695
It was my second day;
your third.

08:21.739 --> 08:23.869
Right. I always
mix that up.Mm-hmm.

08:23.913 --> 08:27.739
Anyway, I suddenly found myself
needing a G-7 encryption form.

08:27.782 --> 08:30.217
Which are very hard to come by.Try impossible.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.826
But there was one left.

08:31.869 --> 08:33.869
And as I'm reaching
for it...

08:33.913 --> 08:37.173
this.. force of nature
beats me to it.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.913
[both laugh]

08:38.956 --> 08:42.260
I mean, we laugh about it now,
but the rest, as they say,

08:42.304 --> 08:43.739
is history.

08:43.782 --> 08:45.043
I hate couples.

08:45.086 --> 08:47.043
You asked how we met.

08:47.086 --> 08:49.913
Granted, you kind of
had to be there.

08:49.956 --> 08:51.173
Oh, no.

08:51.217 --> 08:53.695
No, not you guys.
You're great.

08:53.739 --> 08:55.826
Just couples in general.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.000
The Jamaican resort
I went to last Christmas,

08:58.043 --> 08:59.608
it was couples only.

08:59.652 --> 09:01.695
And you were
flying solo?

09:01.739 --> 09:03.521
Changed my perspective.

09:03.565 --> 09:05.652
Couples everywhere.

09:05.695 --> 09:07.043
It was crazy.

09:07.086 --> 09:10.000
Look at this airport--
it's got every variety.

09:10.043 --> 09:11.869
Like those guys--

09:11.913 --> 09:14.347
Self-Important Pete
and his Electric Lady.

09:14.391 --> 09:16.130
Course, they haven't spoken
directly to each other

09:16.173 --> 09:18.478
since the brownout
of '06.

09:18.521 --> 09:19.826
Then there's those two--

09:19.869 --> 09:21.000
Daddy Issues Debbie

09:21.043 --> 09:23.217
and her college professor
Marty Midlife--

09:23.260 --> 09:26.217
teaching her all he knows
about advanced economics

09:26.260 --> 09:28.608
and the Kama Sutra.JAKE:
Wait.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.347
Tony, that's no couple.

09:30.391 --> 09:32.782
They're clearly
father and daughter.

09:32.826 --> 09:34.260
Think so?Yeah.

09:34.304 --> 09:35.869
Watch the hands.

09:35.913 --> 09:39.043
TONY:
The hands tell you everything.

09:39.086 --> 09:40.695
I stand corrected,

09:40.739 --> 09:42.869
and... disturbed.

09:44.956 --> 09:46.608
Okay...

09:46.652 --> 09:48.913
what about our cranky friend
over there?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.826
Sum him up
for us, Tony.Cranky car salesman.

09:51.869 --> 09:54.000
Lonely childhood.
Behind on his quota.

09:54.043 --> 09:56.043
Regretting
his life choices.

09:56.086 --> 09:57.434
Not a couple.And not familiar

09:57.478 --> 09:58.565
to either of you?

09:58.608 --> 10:00.565
Geez, Ellie, let it go.

10:00.608 --> 10:03.000
I'm trying, but...
he's right there.

10:03.043 --> 10:05.652
You know, Tony, I don't mean
to pin this on NCIS,

10:05.695 --> 10:07.173
but Ellie became
much more suspicious

10:07.217 --> 10:09.521
about people
since she joined you guys.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.782
That is so not true.

10:10.826 --> 10:12.739
Oh, you really like
talking bad guys.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.565
Well, I have to talk
about something,

10:14.608 --> 10:17.304
since we can't
talk shop anymore.

10:17.347 --> 10:19.652
When we were both at NSA,
we'd debrief every night

10:19.695 --> 10:21.826
after work-- but now
that he's restricted

10:21.869 --> 10:23.652
from telling me anything,

10:23.695 --> 10:26.043
all I can do is talk
about what wedo every day.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.652
Chase bad guys.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.000
So I get where I may
seem more suspicious,

10:30.043 --> 10:33.826
but... I'm not.Hey, why don't I get us
some coffee.

10:39.086 --> 10:41.086
JIMMY:
Well, there's Dirk,

10:41.130 --> 10:42.695
if it's a boy,
obviously,

10:42.739 --> 10:44.869
or Oskar, with a "K."

10:44.913 --> 10:48.086
Oskar Palmer--
that's a lot of R's.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.608
Hmm. If it's a girl,
we're thinking, uh,

10:50.652 --> 10:52.695
Freda, Greta, Liesel--

10:52.739 --> 10:55.695
something sort of
von Trapp-ish.[Abby laughs]

10:55.739 --> 10:57.217
Come on, McGee,
up and at 'em.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.434
Workday's over.

10:58.478 --> 11:01.217
We're talking baby names
and snow angels.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.826
Can't right now.
Maybe later.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.217
What do we got, McGee?

11:04.260 --> 11:05.695
JIMMY:
How about you, Agent Gibbs?

11:05.739 --> 11:08.565
When was the last time
you made a good snow angel?

11:09.826 --> 11:11.913
'Cause it's... it's snowing.

11:11.956 --> 11:13.000
[clears throat nervously]

11:14.086 --> 11:15.565
McGee.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.521
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.

11:18.565 --> 11:20.521
They pick up chatter
all the time.

11:20.565 --> 11:23.304
Subject is
northeast U.S. airports.

11:30.782 --> 11:32.130
MAN [over P.A.]:
Attention, passengers--

11:32.173 --> 11:34.000
due to extreme
weather conditions...

11:34.043 --> 11:35.304
[sighs]

11:35.347 --> 11:36.956
Oop. Sorry. Uh...

11:37.000 --> 11:39.043
Oh, hey. You again.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.260
Look, about before,
uh, my husband

11:41.304 --> 11:43.260
has quite
the chivalrous streak.

11:43.304 --> 11:44.652
Uh-huh.

11:44.695 --> 11:47.086
But, you know, now that
I've run into you again...

11:47.130 --> 11:49.043
do we know each other?

11:49.086 --> 11:52.608
I feel like
we've met before.Yeah. I don't think so.

11:52.652 --> 11:53.913
Has that ever
happened to you?

11:53.956 --> 11:56.260
You see a face, you
just can't place it?

11:56.304 --> 11:57.913
Not really, no.Oh.

11:57.956 --> 11:59.478
Delays are a drag, huh?

11:59.521 --> 12:02.043
Where you headed?
Home to see family?

12:02.086 --> 12:03.695
Paris. Business.

12:03.739 --> 12:06.130
Ah, Paris. Huh.
Who doesn't love Paris?

12:06.173 --> 12:09.173
Have a safe trip.
Excuse me.

12:09.217 --> 12:11.608
Sure.
Now you say "excuse me."

12:11.652 --> 12:13.000
Thanks.

12:15.391 --> 12:18.478
We're just killing time waiting
for the storm to blow over.

12:18.521 --> 12:21.434
TONY:
How credible a threat is it?It's elevated.

12:21.478 --> 12:23.652
Pretty typical
this time of year, but...

12:23.695 --> 12:25.043
worth calling about.

12:25.086 --> 12:27.739
Well, man of few words.
Maybe I'm wrong.

12:27.782 --> 12:29.695
She's not talking
about you, boss.

12:29.739 --> 12:31.000
Bishop's husband know anything?

12:32.695 --> 12:35.608
Uh, there was
some talk of chatter.

12:35.652 --> 12:38.043
Just some memos going
around the office, but...

12:38.086 --> 12:39.434
Chatter?

12:39.478 --> 12:41.000
TONY:
Well, snowstormYeah.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.565
will probably keep the
terrorists home anyway, right?

12:42.608 --> 12:44.173
Yeah. It also keeps

12:44.217 --> 12:46.565
first responders
and emergency service vehicles

12:46.608 --> 12:48.478
from getting through,
DiNozzo, so...

12:48.521 --> 12:49.956
keep your eyes open.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.434
Copy that.

12:51.478 --> 12:53.608
You havebeen on edge.

12:53.652 --> 12:55.043
You knew.

12:55.086 --> 12:56.521
We're just hearing
the chatter now?

12:56.565 --> 12:58.521
NSA heard about it
days ago.

12:58.565 --> 13:00.521
Well, I'm...
I'm a lawyer, Tony.

13:00.565 --> 13:03.260
My ear's not exactly pressed
to the pipeline.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.608
So, you didn't...
tell me?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.173
I didn't want to ruin our trip.

13:07.217 --> 13:09.608
Seriously?You know most chatter
doesn't lead anywhere.

13:09.652 --> 13:12.086
All it manages to do
is scare people.

13:12.130 --> 13:14.000
I also know that you
would have never kept a secret

13:14.043 --> 13:16.434
if I was still at NSA.It's not a secret, Ellie,
it's just a...

13:16.478 --> 13:19.043
you know, slightly
calculated omission.

13:19.086 --> 13:21.391
You know what that sounds like?Like a reasonable justification.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.956
I think she was
going for "lie," but
"to-may-to, to-mah-to,"

13:24.000 --> 13:25.304
let's not argue
semantics.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.695
Let's talk national security.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.043
It's Thanksgiving,

13:28.086 --> 13:30.043
in an airport,

13:30.086 --> 13:32.565
and we have the usual menagerie.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.086
Here comes
Walking Boot Wendy.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.956
Clearly faking it, in
hopes of a free upgrade.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.173
I see you, Wendy.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.304
[whispers]:
I see right through you.

13:40.347 --> 13:42.391
Ah, and the inevitable
Pajama Man.

13:42.434 --> 13:44.521
Rolls out of bed,
grabs his passport.

13:44.565 --> 13:45.913
Sees the world

13:45.956 --> 13:47.217
as his futon.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.565
Brad Pitt wants his
hat back, hipster.

13:49.608 --> 13:51.695
Seriously,
what are people thinking?

13:51.739 --> 13:55.000
My parents actually used
to dress up to fly.Mine still does.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.391
You'll meet him
when he gets here.

13:56.434 --> 13:57.434
Huh. Like that guy over there.

13:57.478 --> 13:59.130
TONY:
Dapper Don.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.565
That's what I'm
talking about.

14:00.608 --> 14:02.086
Jetting off to
exotic locales,

14:02.130 --> 14:04.434
like James Bond chasing
after Pussy Galore.

14:04.478 --> 14:07.217
No smelly tracksuit
for that dude.

14:08.260 --> 14:10.478
What's with my Car Salesman?

14:10.521 --> 14:12.434
JAKE: Thought you said
you were wrong about him.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.173
Well, I said maybe, but...

14:14.217 --> 14:16.043
look at his pant cuff, Tony.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.391
Is that a gun?

14:17.434 --> 14:19.478
TONY:
Could be.

14:19.521 --> 14:20.652
We have guns.

14:20.695 --> 14:22.695
Not Ellie. Uh...

14:22.739 --> 14:24.695
she packed hers.No, actually,
mine's on me.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.695
Well, I-I thought you said
you weren't comfortable

14:26.739 --> 14:28.434
traveling with it.Well, I wasn't
at first,

14:28.478 --> 14:30.173
but it's become
kind of a habit.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.739
Listen, this guy could
be law enforcement,

14:31.782 --> 14:34.478
so let's show him ours
and ask to see his.What, guns?

14:34.521 --> 14:36.347
Badges.

14:44.478 --> 14:46.478
Hey. Sorry to
bother you.

14:46.521 --> 14:47.695
Again, you mean?Yeah.

14:47.739 --> 14:49.608
Uh, but this time
I need to see some I.D.

14:49.652 --> 14:51.217
Well, too bad.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.869
I'm not Navy.

14:52.913 --> 14:55.826
She asked you
a question.

14:55.869 --> 14:58.043
[sighs]: You're making
a big mistake.

15:00.130 --> 15:00.782
Freeze.

15:01.739 --> 15:02.652
Hands where
I can see them.

15:03.739 --> 15:05.000
Oh.

15:05.043 --> 15:06.434
Okay. Well, what's his deal?

15:06.478 --> 15:07.652
I'm an air marshal.

15:08.869 --> 15:11.565
Mike Beers.

15:11.608 --> 15:14.391
Thanks for blowing my cover.

15:28.869 --> 15:31.217
Sorry I drew on you,
Mr. Beers.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.347
These two kind of...
forced my hand.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.391
Just doing your job,
Officer.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.695
But I will have to warn
my fellow air marshals

15:37.739 --> 15:39.826
about skittish Navy cops.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.478
Okay, you could have
quietly said something

15:41.521 --> 15:44.347
when I badged you.And you are aware of
the recent chatter?

15:44.391 --> 15:45.869
It's my job to know.

15:45.913 --> 15:47.086
But look,
I don't think anyone

15:47.130 --> 15:49.521
waiting for my Paris
flight saw that, anyway,

15:49.565 --> 15:51.478
so let's just forget it.

15:51.521 --> 15:53.739
All right. No hard feelings,
Mr. Beers.

15:53.782 --> 15:56.043
I guess we could all use one.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.521
One what?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.391
A beer. Your name.

15:59.434 --> 16:01.391
Ah. Right.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.434
[chuckles][weak chuckle]

16:06.652 --> 16:07.652
[door closes]Huh.

16:07.695 --> 16:08.782
"Huh" what?

16:09.739 --> 16:10.956
[phone rings]

16:11.000 --> 16:12.304
It's Gibbs.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.043
Want me to tell him?No, let me.

16:14.086 --> 16:15.478
Put him on speaker.

16:15.521 --> 16:17.652
You've got us
both, Gibbs.

16:17.695 --> 16:18.869
You got anything
to report?

16:18.913 --> 16:19.869
Nothing, boss.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.434
Just compared notes with a...

16:21.478 --> 16:23.739
rather cranky
air marshal.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.434
He's aware of the chatter.

16:25.478 --> 16:27.217
Does he know that
the chatter has changed?

16:27.260 --> 16:29.260
Threat level's been increased,
and now it specifically

16:29.304 --> 16:31.956
mentions
DC metropolitan airports.

16:32.913 --> 16:34.043
That is a game changer.

16:34.086 --> 16:35.130
GIBBS:
It still could be nothing.

16:35.173 --> 16:36.913
Just keep your heads
on a swivel.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.869
Call if anything's changed.
You got anything else?

16:38.913 --> 16:39.869
Yeah, actually, Gibbs...

16:39.913 --> 16:40.739
No. That's it.

16:40.782 --> 16:41.913
Thanks.

16:42.913 --> 16:45.043
We should have
told Gibbs.

16:45.086 --> 16:46.782
Later.

16:46.826 --> 16:48.000
[line rings]

16:48.043 --> 16:49.869
[phone ringing]

16:53.391 --> 16:55.478
Come on, McGee, answer.

16:55.521 --> 16:58.086
[ringing continues]Aren't you
gonna get that?

16:59.608 --> 17:00.695
Yes?

17:00.739 --> 17:01.869
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.608
Okay. Yes?

17:03.652 --> 17:04.869
The air marshal
I mentioned before--

17:04.913 --> 17:07.565
I need you to dig up
anything you can on him.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.000
Name is Mike Beers.

17:09.043 --> 17:11.000
Well, that could take a while.
TSA personnel files

17:11.043 --> 17:12.608
are always tightly wrapped.

17:12.652 --> 17:13.869
What's this about?

17:13.913 --> 17:15.739
Bishop knows the guy
from somewhere.

17:15.782 --> 17:17.608
She's trying to
figure out why.

17:17.652 --> 17:19.304
Soon as you can, McGee.

17:19.347 --> 17:20.826
Yeah.

17:22.391 --> 17:24.260
Don't look at me.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.304
Just do it.

17:28.086 --> 17:30.782
Is everything okay?
What took so long?

17:30.826 --> 17:32.565
The air marshal,
where'd he go?

17:32.608 --> 17:34.565
He's, um... the
charging station.

17:34.608 --> 17:36.130
What was that about, Tony?

17:36.173 --> 17:39.304
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs
until we're sure about this guy.

17:39.347 --> 17:42.086
Sure about what?Well, that joke
I told back there.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.086
It's like Jake
with Chinatown.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.608
Anybody named Beers

17:45.652 --> 17:47.782
would be sick to death
of a joke like that.

17:47.826 --> 17:50.043
That guy acted like
he never heard it before.

17:50.086 --> 17:51.695
JAKE: In strictly
legal terms, Tony,

17:51.739 --> 17:54.913
someone having no sense of humor
won't get you probable cause.

17:54.956 --> 17:56.782
Until we hear back from McGee,
that's cause enough for me.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.913
Mind if I get Abby
in the loop?Do it.

18:01.826 --> 18:03.826
[phone keypad beeping]

18:09.130 --> 18:10.347
[click]

18:14.521 --> 18:16.652
Beers. Beers. Hey, Beers.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.478
Hey, come here, Beers.

18:19.521 --> 18:21.391
Beers Palmer. Huh?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.869
That's different.

18:22.913 --> 18:24.391
Do you want your kid
to like you?

18:24.434 --> 18:27.000
GIBBS:
Anything on the air marshal?

18:27.043 --> 18:29.304
Whoa. You know about this guy?

18:29.347 --> 18:30.521
McGee's got the name,
you got

18:30.565 --> 18:31.608
the picture--
what's the big secret?

18:31.652 --> 18:32.956
JIMMY: I think
that Bishop and Tony

18:33.000 --> 18:34.826
didn't want you to know
that they blew his cover.

18:34.869 --> 18:36.695
And why did I
just tell you that?

18:36.739 --> 18:39.739
And why do you know that?ABBY:
Because he's very, very nosy.

18:39.782 --> 18:42.173
So far, no hits on
facial recognition.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.565
McGEE:
Abby, hey...

18:43.608 --> 18:45.782
Whoa. Boss.

18:45.826 --> 18:46.565
McGee?

18:46.608 --> 18:47.695
He knows, Tim.

18:48.347 --> 18:49.347
I talk too much.

18:49.391 --> 18:50.652
That your guy's info?

18:52.130 --> 18:52.739
Come here.

18:52.782 --> 18:53.826
Yeah, just, uh...

18:53.869 --> 18:54.869
just came in.

18:54.913 --> 18:56.608
Abby, check
your in-box, please.

18:56.652 --> 18:59.652
Uh, I just sent you
his I.D. photo.Oh. Great.

18:59.695 --> 19:01.565
Facial comparison
should get us somewhere.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.000
McGEE:
Michael Beers, 41,
retired Marine.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.956
Air marshal since 2010.
Lives up in Syracuse.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.739
Wife and two kids.ABBY:
I'm digging

19:07.782 --> 19:09.173
this guy's glasses.

19:09.217 --> 19:10.565
Those would be cute
on you, Gibbs.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.695
I mean, not that

19:11.739 --> 19:13.521
squinting isn't totally

19:13.565 --> 19:14.956
super cute on you, too.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.652
I checked his accounts,
boss-- he's got

19:16.695 --> 19:18.652
an open credit card at a motel
about a mile from here.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.608
Never checked out?Not yet, anyway.

19:20.652 --> 19:22.217
Well, okay,
red flag city here.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.043
As much as these two look alike,
the key markers--

19:25.086 --> 19:26.608
it's definitely not a match.

19:26.652 --> 19:28.391
Well, who's that at the airport?I don't know.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.521
But whoever it is,

19:29.565 --> 19:31.565
it's not Air Marshal
Mike Beers.

19:33.739 --> 19:34.956
All right, boss.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.173
You got it;
we won't.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.652
Won't what? Why couldn't
that be on speaker?

19:39.695 --> 19:42.478
Gibbs doesn't want to alert
the innocent bystanders

19:42.521 --> 19:45.478
that our friend over
there is an imposter.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.478
JAKE:
You were right.

19:50.521 --> 19:51.565
You were right.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.739
We were both right.Then who is he?

19:53.782 --> 19:55.130
Not a clue.

19:55.173 --> 19:57.652
All we know is he's got a gun,
maybe worse.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.913
Gibbs says he's got
a backup unit on the way.

19:59.956 --> 20:02.086
We don't make any moves
until they get here.

20:02.130 --> 20:03.565
I'm gonna let McGee know.

20:03.608 --> 20:06.608
I can't believe you
do this every day.

20:06.652 --> 20:08.565
Well, not every day,
and not like this.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.260
You sure we're not
too conspicuous?

20:10.304 --> 20:12.565
Not if we stand here like we're
just talking to each other.

20:12.608 --> 20:13.521
We aretalking to each other.

20:14.608 --> 20:15.869
You two with NCIS?I am.

20:15.913 --> 20:17.434
Special Agent
Ellie Bishop.

20:17.478 --> 20:18.695
Special Agent DiNozzo.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.304
And I'm Jake Malloy.Lieutenant
Janet Lewis.

20:20.347 --> 20:22.347
Now, where is this
alleged imposter?

20:22.391 --> 20:23.652
He just went
into the men's room.

20:23.695 --> 20:25.434
Calm and cool.
Secure this whole area.

20:25.478 --> 20:27.260
No one enters
until I say.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.434
Not quite the cavalry
we were expecting.

20:30.478 --> 20:32.434
Yeah, well, I expected
to be home right now

20:32.478 --> 20:34.913
getting my cranberries started,
but we can't have everything.

20:34.956 --> 20:36.478
You have your
service weapons?

20:36.521 --> 20:40.130
Oh, not me. I'm a-an
attorney, with NSA.

20:40.173 --> 20:42.521
Attorneys stand
over there, please.

20:44.173 --> 20:45.391
Be careful.

20:45.434 --> 20:47.347
I will be.

20:47.391 --> 20:49.652
Adorable. Okay, now,
let's keep our weapons

20:49.695 --> 20:51.347
out of sight until
we get in there.

20:51.391 --> 20:53.521
Last thing we want to do
is panic this crowd.

20:53.565 --> 20:55.478
Can't we just evacuate
this terminal?

20:55.521 --> 20:56.739
What's the last
thing we want?

20:56.782 --> 20:59.086
No panic. Right.Okay, is the tutorial over?

20:59.130 --> 21:00.391
Let's get in there.

21:04.043 --> 21:06.565
[clears throat softly]

21:06.608 --> 21:08.608
[whispers]:
Out of here.

21:15.956 --> 21:17.913
Beers, is that you?

21:17.956 --> 21:19.913
It's Janet Lewis, Beers.

21:19.956 --> 21:22.695
You haven't been answering your
phone. Everything all right?

21:22.739 --> 21:24.565
Beers?

21:44.565 --> 21:46.130
Oh, my God.

21:49.565 --> 21:52.043
LEWIS:
You're right, that's not Beers.

21:52.086 --> 21:53.565
But it sure looks like him.

21:53.608 --> 21:54.695
He's not anybody anymore.

21:54.739 --> 21:56.478
Looks like a stab wound.

21:56.521 --> 21:57.913
All right,
it's time

21:57.956 --> 21:59.956
to shut down the airport.Not a problem.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.391
We've been unofficially shut
down for the last 20 minutes.

22:02.434 --> 22:05.260
No vehicles in or out
until this storm ends.

22:05.304 --> 22:07.304
His gun's gone, Tony.

22:07.347 --> 22:09.521
[exhales]
Great.

22:09.565 --> 22:10.739
We're snowed in here

22:10.782 --> 22:12.565
with an airport
full of cranky passengers,

22:12.608 --> 22:14.478
a dead fake air marshal,
and his killer

22:14.521 --> 22:16.782
somewhere on the loose,
with a knife and a gun.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.434
Anybody else

22:18.478 --> 22:21.521
feel like
they're playing "Clue"?

22:28.521 --> 22:29.695
[camera clicking]

22:32.217 --> 22:33.913
Unbelievable.

22:33.956 --> 22:36.913
These shots will be coming to
you from Jake's phone, McGee.

22:40.173 --> 22:41.869
We'll send them to Ducky, too.

22:41.913 --> 22:44.956
I think he's gonna be busy
for a while.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.826
"And it ain't a fit night out
for man nor beast."

22:47.869 --> 22:50.869
Yet I'm the one who had
to get out and push
the van, Shakespeare.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.739
That was W.C. Fields,
Mr. Palmer,

22:52.782 --> 22:54.521
in The Fatal Glass of Beer.

22:54.565 --> 22:56.695
[like Fields]:
And I predict
you will be

22:56.739 --> 22:59.478
pushing it again
on the way back.

22:59.521 --> 23:02.434
You carry
crime scene gloves now, too?

23:02.478 --> 23:05.782
Well, it's become
kind of a habit.

23:05.826 --> 23:07.695
No I.D. on him, McGee,

23:07.739 --> 23:09.521
other than the air
marshal credentials.

23:09.565 --> 23:12.260
If I had your crime scene gizmo,
I could get his prints.

23:12.304 --> 23:14.739
Do you have any adhesive tape
and baby powder handy?

23:17.304 --> 23:18.913
Wait, hold on, Bishop.

23:18.956 --> 23:20.304
Is that Beer's wallet?

23:20.347 --> 23:23.739
Yeah. Killer took
his credentials but not this.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.173
Driver's license, cash,

23:26.217 --> 23:28.347
credit cards--
it's all there.

23:28.391 --> 23:31.217
What are you thinking?He wasn't looking to play
air marshal very long.

23:31.260 --> 23:34.652
Just long enough to go
to the airport to do
what he needed to do.

23:34.695 --> 23:38.565
Whatever that was,
he was obviously killed
before he got the job done.

23:38.608 --> 23:41.695
Unless his job was to kill Beers
and take his identity.

23:41.739 --> 23:43.739
And deliver his weapon
to the airport.

23:43.782 --> 23:44.782
But deliver it to who?

23:44.826 --> 23:46.608
LEWIS:
And why?

23:46.652 --> 23:49.608
Why would someone deliver a gun
just to end up dead himself?

23:49.652 --> 23:51.782
Honor among thieves?
That's not really a thing.

23:51.826 --> 23:53.565
Beers was a good man.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.260
But our TSA screeners don't know
every air marshal on sight.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.956
New ones come through here
every day.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.652
At least now we know
what all the chatter was about.

23:59.695 --> 24:00.913
But whoever's
got the gun

24:00.956 --> 24:02.565
is outside, waiting to use it.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.652
So we start
searching passengers.

24:03.695 --> 24:04.869
That's one sure way

24:04.913 --> 24:06.304
to force our killer's hand.

24:06.347 --> 24:08.260
I was thinking
of a less violent idea.

24:08.304 --> 24:09.521
He had to walk
right past us

24:09.565 --> 24:11.695
in the eight minutes
we were waiting outside.

24:11.739 --> 24:14.478
We have a surveillance camera
pointed right at that door.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.260
Be right back, Bishop.

24:16.304 --> 24:17.695
Okay, Tony.

24:17.739 --> 24:19.434
I never should have doubted you.

24:19.478 --> 24:21.086
Well, you didn't.
You're helping me.

24:21.130 --> 24:23.173
No, I-I mean before--
when you said...

24:23.217 --> 24:24.913
this guy was suspicious.

24:24.956 --> 24:26.695
I just thought I knew him.

24:26.739 --> 24:28.478
I still don't know why.

24:28.521 --> 24:31.043
Grab his arm.What?

24:31.086 --> 24:32.652
Yeah, just don't
touch his skin.

24:32.695 --> 24:34.043
Oh.

24:35.826 --> 24:37.608
[whispers]:
Perfect.

24:40.782 --> 24:42.782
Bandage?Right here.

24:42.826 --> 24:43.826
Okay...

24:48.695 --> 24:52.217
I can't get over your... speed.

24:52.260 --> 24:53.608
[chuckles]:
You used to spend months

24:53.652 --> 24:55.000
researching, analyzing,
planning--

24:55.043 --> 24:56.739
now you just... go.

24:57.739 --> 24:59.869
Jake, I'm still the same person.

24:59.913 --> 25:03.608
The same person having
a conversation over a dead body.

25:03.652 --> 25:07.043
McGEE:
You guys know
I'm still here, right?

25:07.086 --> 25:08.391
Any luck on those prints?

25:08.434 --> 25:09.565
BISHOP:
Uh, yeah.

25:09.608 --> 25:10.608
We got one, McGee.

25:10.652 --> 25:12.347
Sending it straight to Abby.

25:15.173 --> 25:17.217
LEWIS:
Is that what I think it is?

25:17.260 --> 25:18.695
TONY:
Low-tech but effective.

25:18.739 --> 25:21.956
Who's lead officer
on this wing?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.565
Uh... I'm real sorry,
Lieutenant.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.782
I don't know
how we missed that.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.043
Well, the good news is, there
are other cameras pointed

25:29.086 --> 25:31.695
in this direction--
we just have to look
at that footage.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.695
Restrooms stay closed
until we can an M.E. here.

25:34.739 --> 25:37.434
And no one leaves until
I check surveillance.Yes, ma'am.

25:37.478 --> 25:38.956
All right, let's go.Go?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.608
No. We got this.

25:40.652 --> 25:42.739
No, clearly,
you're shorthanded.

25:42.782 --> 25:44.565
I appreciate your help,
Agent DiNozzo,

25:44.608 --> 25:46.521
but airport surveillance
is for TSA

25:46.565 --> 25:47.565
and our eyes only.

25:47.608 --> 25:49.217
That's Homeland's rules,
not mine.

25:49.260 --> 25:51.608
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look, delays are bad enough,

25:51.652 --> 25:53.043
but now the bathrooms?

25:53.086 --> 25:54.913
Do you know who I am?

25:54.956 --> 25:56.521
WOMAN:
There's something going on here,

25:56.565 --> 25:57.956
and you are not telling us.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.652
Folks, please, there's
no cause for alarm.

25:59.695 --> 26:02.478
Passenger just had
a medical issue in there.MAN: Excuse me.

26:02.521 --> 26:04.652
I'm a doctor. Can I help?Ah.

26:04.695 --> 26:06.130
thank you, Doctor.
No, we've got

26:06.173 --> 26:07.391
everything
under control.

26:07.434 --> 26:09.521
That's a sharp suit.
Kudos to your tailor.

26:09.565 --> 26:11.652
But... everyone, can
I have your attention?

26:11.695 --> 26:13.217
Thank you
for your patience,

26:13.260 --> 26:15.478
but we do have a
medical emergency,
so in the spirit

26:15.521 --> 26:17.478
of the holiday, can we all
just have a good wish--

26:17.521 --> 26:20.521
WOMAN:
Give it a rest, you pretty boy!DOCTOR: Excuse me,

26:20.565 --> 26:21.434
I don't think
that's necessary.

26:21.478 --> 26:23.000
You cram it, too!

26:23.043 --> 26:25.304
Appreciate the help, Doc.

26:25.347 --> 26:26.652
Nice suit.LEWIS:
Clear this area, please.

26:26.695 --> 26:28.695
Everybody, can we
just clear out of this area?

26:28.739 --> 26:32.000
There is another restroom
under the stairs to the left.

26:33.521 --> 26:35.043
What's going on
out here?

26:35.086 --> 26:36.565
Angry mob
getting angrier.

26:36.608 --> 26:39.608
And somebody's
still packing.

26:42.347 --> 26:43.652
There you are.

26:43.695 --> 26:45.000
City roads are bad enough--

26:45.043 --> 26:46.521
forget about getting
to the airport.

26:46.565 --> 26:49.217
That our fake
air marshal?I.D.'d from the fingerprint

26:49.260 --> 26:50.565
that Bishop sent over.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.173
Facial recognition
came up empty for a reason.

26:53.217 --> 26:55.478
This guy is
a notorious chameleon.

26:55.521 --> 26:58.391
Well, it would explain why
Bishop found him familiar,
but not familiar enough.

26:58.434 --> 27:01.000
Norman Dopps.
Name rings a bell.Maybe because

27:01.043 --> 27:03.000
he comes up
on our Most Wanted updates

27:03.043 --> 27:04.217
every week.

27:04.260 --> 27:06.782
He's this go-to
jack-of-all-trades

27:06.826 --> 27:08.956
for organized crime families
and drug cartels

27:09.000 --> 27:11.391
and other horrible people
that can afford him.

27:11.434 --> 27:13.304
Any terrorist affiliation?Probably...

27:13.347 --> 27:15.913
the only thing
that's not on his record. Why?

27:15.956 --> 27:17.347
Chatter may not
be about him.

27:17.391 --> 27:19.173
McGEE:
Not so fast, boss.

27:19.217 --> 27:20.608
Chatter's changed again.

27:20.652 --> 27:22.782
Look at this.

27:22.826 --> 27:24.391
On it, Gibbs.
We'll call you back.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.217
I knew I'd seen his face before;
the Most Wanted updates.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.652
I check them religiously.

27:28.695 --> 27:31.130
Well, I guess I'm
only mildly religious.

27:31.173 --> 27:33.217
What did Gibbs
say, Tony?

27:33.260 --> 27:35.608
Homeland now thinks
it's an assassination plan.

27:35.652 --> 27:37.043
Assassination of who?

27:37.956 --> 27:39.478
This guy?TONY: No.

27:39.521 --> 27:41.434
He was delivering the gun
to an assassin

27:41.478 --> 27:44.304
who is likely sitting
out there right now.

27:44.347 --> 27:47.000
Well, then they should just
shut down the terminal
and question everybody.

27:47.043 --> 27:48.434
And let it happen again
somewhere else?

27:48.478 --> 27:49.826
No dice.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.826
We got a locked room
full of suspects

27:51.869 --> 27:53.347
out there, Inspector Poirot.

27:53.391 --> 27:55.130
Yeah, and if the target's
out there, too,

27:55.173 --> 27:56.434
he'd probably be dead already.

27:56.478 --> 27:58.391
It's got to be someone
on an incoming flight.

27:58.434 --> 28:00.043
McGee's running manifests
right now, but...

28:00.086 --> 28:01.043
[phone rings]

28:01.086 --> 28:02.956
Oh. There he is.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.043
Well, that was fast,
McGenius.

28:05.086 --> 28:07.043
Hey. Manifests are on their way.
In the meantime,

28:07.086 --> 28:09.869
Gibbs wants to keep
an extra set of eyes on you.

28:09.913 --> 28:11.391
But security at the airport

28:11.434 --> 28:13.086
won't let us access
their surveillance.

28:13.130 --> 28:16.304
Yeah. They're very touchy
about their cameras around here.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.304
Yeah, so much
for interagency cooperation.

28:18.347 --> 28:22.347
Well, uh, look, if a camera's
what's needed, maybe, uh...

28:22.391 --> 28:25.217
maybe this'll do.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.608
On three.

28:29.652 --> 28:31.043
One, two...

28:31.086 --> 28:32.347
[grunts]

28:34.521 --> 28:37.913
Rest there, Mr. Beers.
We'll get back to you shortly.

28:37.956 --> 28:39.391
Bishop's photos
from the airport.

28:39.434 --> 28:41.391
Yeah, let's take a look
at this imposter.

28:41.434 --> 28:42.869
[electrical crackling, buzzing]

28:42.913 --> 28:44.000
Whoa.

28:45.086 --> 28:47.565
Is that me?Most likely the storm

28:47.608 --> 28:51.434
wreaking havoc
with the power grid.

28:51.478 --> 28:54.434
Well, we still
have power.Yeah, well,

28:54.478 --> 28:57.913
let's work quickly, Mr. Palmer,
while we still can.

28:57.956 --> 29:00.478
Abby said our dead
fake air marshal's name

29:00.521 --> 29:02.000
is Norman Dopps.

29:02.043 --> 29:03.391
Norman.

29:03.434 --> 29:05.391
There's a name, huh?Well, the Normans
were Vikings.

29:05.434 --> 29:07.608
They settled on part
of the coast of France.

29:07.652 --> 29:11.565
Yes, on what one day would
become known as Normandy.See, now,

29:11.608 --> 29:12.913
that history is great,

29:12.956 --> 29:15.000
but I just couldn't do it
to the little guy.

29:15.043 --> 29:16.782
Norman is
a bit too Psycho-ish.

29:16.826 --> 29:18.782
You could always
shorten it to Norm.

29:18.826 --> 29:21.173
Norm? Norm!

29:21.217 --> 29:23.434
Nah, see, I'd have
to fight the urge to
give the kid a beer.

29:23.478 --> 29:24.434
[beeping]Oh.

29:24.478 --> 29:25.869
Here we go.

29:25.913 --> 29:28.347
DUCKY:
Ah. Murder on the lavatory.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.434
Bishop sent these
in the second e-mail.

29:30.478 --> 29:31.565
Yeah, it's quite a...

29:31.608 --> 29:34.173
nasty and narrow puncture wound.

29:34.217 --> 29:36.869
From a plastic knife,
or something that could
get past security?

29:36.913 --> 29:38.130
No, no, no, no, no.

29:38.173 --> 29:41.217
Something stronger,
to pierce the rib cage.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.043
A nylon dagger.

29:43.086 --> 29:45.173
Or carbon fiber, perhaps.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.521
And based on the incision,

29:47.565 --> 29:50.782
it seems to have been twisted,
twisted on entry.

29:50.826 --> 29:52.130
For maximum damage.

29:52.173 --> 29:53.173
Mm, clearly,

29:53.217 --> 29:54.391
an expert kill.

29:54.434 --> 29:56.391
How soon till we get these
up to Jethro?

29:56.434 --> 29:59.000
Oh... I can bring them
on my tablet.

29:59.043 --> 30:02.000
Do you know the meaning
of the name Jethro?

30:02.043 --> 30:05.043
Ah, there would be
some large shoes to fill.

30:05.086 --> 30:07.086
But what's
in a name, Mr. Palmer?

30:07.130 --> 30:09.652
"That which we call a rose,
by any other name

30:09.695 --> 30:11.695
would smell as sweet."

30:11.739 --> 30:13.956
That is Shakespeare, right?No, no, no.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.217
It's W.C. Fields again.Oh.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.086
He had a million of 'em.

30:18.130 --> 30:19.391
[quiet chuckle]

30:23.869 --> 30:26.565
How's that angle for you, Tim?
Can you see?

30:26.608 --> 30:29.043
It's the west side entrance
to the terminal.

30:29.086 --> 30:31.086
Yeah, a little higher, Jake?

30:31.130 --> 30:33.130
Higher. Hm. Okay.

30:35.173 --> 30:37.173
JAKE: How's that?That's good. Not bad.

30:37.217 --> 30:40.173
He's adorable, and
he's tech-savvy.

30:40.217 --> 30:42.347
Yeah, that'll work, Jake.
Thank you.

30:42.391 --> 30:45.304
DUCKY: Not my first body
on a toilet, Jethro,

30:45.347 --> 30:47.956
but always
a disturbing sight.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.608
Single blade
to the left of the manubrium.

30:49.652 --> 30:52.304
I'd wager that his heart
was pierced in a single thrust.

30:52.347 --> 30:55.043
JIMMY: Do you need help?ABBY: Yeah, is there
anything we can do?

30:55.086 --> 30:57.086
Yeah. You can help McGee
go through the manifest.

30:57.130 --> 30:59.000
Both of you--
names and faces. Duck,

30:59.043 --> 31:01.260
take a look at the crowd--
looking for anything

31:01.304 --> 31:02.739
or anyone that
doesn't look right.

31:02.782 --> 31:04.826
At an airport?
Let me count the ways.

31:04.869 --> 31:07.260
All right, we've only got
outgoing flights so far.

31:07.304 --> 31:09.086
Basic passenger info's
printed on there,

31:09.130 --> 31:10.173
along with
passport photos.

31:10.217 --> 31:12.086
So our killer's
in the mix?

31:12.130 --> 31:13.434
Likely, under an alias.

31:13.478 --> 31:16.000
McGee, what is the holdup
on those manifests?

31:16.043 --> 31:17.217
Well, systems are down
everywhere, boss.

31:17.260 --> 31:19.304
Every airline and agency's
backed up.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.130
I don't care.
Our killer's target

31:21.173 --> 31:23.304
could be on one
of those inbound flights.

31:23.347 --> 31:25.260
I'll keep calling.ABBY: On the
bright side,

31:25.304 --> 31:27.130
it looks like the snow's
starting to let up.

31:31.304 --> 31:33.260
Geez, when you're looking
for bad guys...

31:33.304 --> 31:35.304
They all look
like bad guys.

31:35.347 --> 31:40.043
BISHOP: Well, it's letting up
out there.Oh, finally, some relief.

31:40.086 --> 31:43.260
Yet I don't feel
relieved. What?

31:45.391 --> 31:48.000
What are you doing?Surveillance
gave us nothing.

31:48.043 --> 31:50.130
Oh, wait, not true--
I got to watch

31:50.173 --> 31:52.173
your initial takedown
of our fake air marshal.

31:52.217 --> 31:54.130
Very stealthy.If you search these people,

31:54.173 --> 31:57.217
you risk cornering our killer--
that could end very badly.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.391
Which is the same fight I just
had with Homeland, and lost.

31:59.434 --> 32:01.869
With three flights low on fuel
and coming in for landings,

32:01.913 --> 32:04.043
they want this missing gun
found right now.

32:04.086 --> 32:06.391
Three flights landing?JAKE: We didn't know
anything about that.

32:06.434 --> 32:08.000
TICKET AGENT: Ladies and
gentlemen, we're happy

32:08.043 --> 32:09.739
to report some good news.

32:09.782 --> 32:13.217
Tower confirms one runway
has now been cleared

32:13.260 --> 32:14.826
to allow landings
from incoming flights

32:14.869 --> 32:18.130
from London,
Athens and Brussels.

32:18.173 --> 32:20.260
What does that
do for us?

32:20.304 --> 32:22.217
How much longer
do we have to wait?

32:22.260 --> 32:24.043
The first flight
should be touching down

32:24.086 --> 32:25.565
in about 15 minutes!

32:25.608 --> 32:28.391
Thanks again for your patience.

32:28.434 --> 32:30.043
BISHOP [sighs]:
Well,

32:30.086 --> 32:32.086
so much for not forcing
our gunman's hand.

32:32.130 --> 32:33.173
Just when I thought things

32:33.217 --> 32:34.304
couldn't get any more
interesting.

32:34.347 --> 32:35.739
You have no idea.

32:35.782 --> 32:37.130
Tony's dad is
on that London flight.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.391
Come on.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.956
Figure it out.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.347
Who's the target on the plane?
Who's the hit man?

32:53.391 --> 32:56.000
Let's talk possible
hit people first.

32:56.043 --> 32:57.956
We have
a Joseph McBride.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.086
He's 49,
from Springfield, Virginia.

33:00.130 --> 33:01.826
He's a lobbyist
for a chemical company.

33:01.869 --> 33:02.565
Next.

33:03.478 --> 33:05.434
JIMMY: Ruth Potts,
62, Fairfax,

33:05.478 --> 33:06.695
retired schoolteacher,

33:06.739 --> 33:08.217
who wouldn't hurt a fly,
obviously.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.652
Just look
at that sweet lady.

33:09.695 --> 33:10.478
Next.

33:11.565 --> 33:13.347
Thanks. Boss, I got 'em.

33:13.391 --> 33:14.565
Manifests for
17 different

33:14.608 --> 33:17.347
inbound flights
arriving to Dulles tonight.

33:17.391 --> 33:18.521
Okay, divvy 'em up.

33:18.565 --> 33:19.391
Deal me in as well.

33:19.434 --> 33:20.956
We are looking for a target

33:21.000 --> 33:24.043
significant enough to warrant
killing a federal air marshal.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.869
LEWIS [over P.A.]:
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to the extended delay,

33:26.913 --> 33:30.521
TSA is now required to perform
a second routine screening.

33:30.565 --> 33:32.391
We apologize
for any inconvenience,

33:32.434 --> 33:36.130
but we'll begin
with Calgary flight 3184.

33:36.173 --> 33:38.869
If those passengers could calmly
line up over there, please?

33:38.913 --> 33:41.347
Thank you.

33:48.565 --> 33:51.347
TSA isn't saying anything
about landing order, Gibbs.

33:51.391 --> 33:53.260
They're all low on fuel, so...

33:53.304 --> 33:54.956
it's first come, first serve.Stay alert, Bishop.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.391
We're watching.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.217
Okay.

33:58.260 --> 34:01.478
POTTS: What are they going
to ask us to do next?

34:01.521 --> 34:04.913
Somebody's really
gonna get hurt.

34:04.956 --> 34:07.000
Maybe they should've just
shut down the terminal.

34:07.043 --> 34:08.608
And miss catching
Professor Plum red-handed

34:08.652 --> 34:10.391
in the conservatory
with the wrench?

34:10.434 --> 34:12.869
Don't tell me
you're enjoying this.

34:12.913 --> 34:16.391
You know the NSA, sweetheart--
we don't get out much.

34:17.434 --> 34:21.260
London, Brussels, Athens...

34:21.304 --> 34:23.434
Speaking of Brussels--
fun fact:

34:23.478 --> 34:26.478
the Brussels sprout--
Americans like to drop the "S"

34:26.521 --> 34:28.347
and just say
"Brussel," but...Jimmy.

34:28.391 --> 34:30.391
DUCKY:
Put a sock in it, Mr. Palmer.

34:30.434 --> 34:32.347
Find the target, people.

34:32.391 --> 34:34.869
Let's go,
let's go.

34:34.913 --> 34:36.565
Come on.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.173
LEWIS: Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now be re-screening

34:39.217 --> 34:40.826
Paris flight 8247.

34:40.869 --> 34:42.565
MAN:
Why screen us twice?

34:42.608 --> 34:44.478
It's not like any of us
have gone anywhere.

34:44.521 --> 34:46.652
DOCTOR: I know, but it
only took a minute.

34:46.695 --> 34:49.739
Miss, can I
give you a hand?

34:52.782 --> 34:54.086
Thank you for helping me.

35:10.565 --> 35:12.869
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

35:12.913 --> 35:15.000
You got something, Abbs?The London flight.

35:15.043 --> 35:18.347
Two Colombian federal agents
and an unnamed third party.

35:18.391 --> 35:21.391
Scheduled to deplane
at Dulles, and then

35:21.434 --> 35:23.608
connect on a later flight
to Bogotá.

35:23.652 --> 35:25.173
Opportunity. McGee.

35:25.217 --> 35:26.086
Working on it.

35:26.130 --> 35:27.086
Opportunity, Agent Gibbs?

35:27.130 --> 35:28.913
Two feds and an
unnamed party.

35:28.956 --> 35:31.565
Got to be a foreign leader,
protected witness or fugitive.

35:31.608 --> 35:33.260
All possible targets
for someone.

35:33.304 --> 35:35.826
That changing flights at Dulles
would be a vulnerable moment

35:35.869 --> 35:38.347
and the killer's one chance
to exact revenge.

35:38.391 --> 35:39.782
McGEE:
It's a great catch, Abbs.

35:39.826 --> 35:41.043
They're escorting Hector Gomez,

35:41.086 --> 35:42.869
a high-level member
of Cartel Dominguez.

35:42.913 --> 35:45.173
Wanted for the murder
of a rival cartel dealer.

35:45.217 --> 35:47.826
Gomez was captured hiding out
in Wales, of all places.

35:47.869 --> 35:50.173
Colombian authorities were
extraditing him this morning.

35:50.217 --> 35:52.000
GIBBS:
That outgoing flight to Bogotá,

35:52.043 --> 35:53.391
do we have a manifest?

35:53.434 --> 35:54.347
There isn't one yet.

35:54.391 --> 35:55.782
Must have been
a private charter.

35:55.826 --> 35:58.217
Who in that terminal
is Colombian?

35:59.217 --> 36:01.782
Tell me about recent trips
to South America,

36:01.826 --> 36:02.695
e-mails, anything.

36:02.739 --> 36:04.652
Cross-referencing DEA and CIA.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.173
That's a needle
in a haystack.

36:06.217 --> 36:07.652
DUCKY: A haystack controlled
by the world's

36:07.695 --> 36:09.391
most dangerous drug cartel.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.260
[dialing phone]

36:12.608 --> 36:17.217
[sighs] Hey, so, are those
your fancy flying pajamas,

36:17.260 --> 36:19.130
or just your everyday casuals?

36:19.173 --> 36:21.130
Dude, I'm not
getting re-screened.

36:21.173 --> 36:23.347
Uh-huh. Why's that?What...

36:24.217 --> 36:25.347
Don't.

36:30.434 --> 36:31.478
That's not mine.

36:32.521 --> 36:35.260
Go get re-screened.

here, please.

Excuse me.
Lana, is it?

37:56.608 --> 37:58.260
I'm afraid you
can't let anyone

37:58.304 --> 38:00.304
off that plane.They've been circling

38:00.347 --> 38:01.739
for hours.

38:01.782 --> 38:04.043
I only take orders from TSA.

38:04.086 --> 38:06.086
Tell her, Ellie.What's this all about?

38:06.130 --> 38:07.391

a gun yet?

38:07.434 --> 38:09.260
No, but we're
not done screening.

38:09.304 --> 38:11.043
Well, unless you want an
assassination on your hands,

38:11.086 --> 38:12.173
you're gonna move that plane
to another gate.

38:12.217 --> 38:13.391
This is the only gate
that's cleared,

38:13.434 --> 38:14.391
and the plane's
already de-boarding.

38:14.434 --> 38:15.565

And I actually
got a text from Tony.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.956
Apparently, Senior...

39:30.000 --> 39:33.086
missed his flight from London
and neglected to tell him.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.652

have to be there?

39:34.695 --> 39:36.260
Nope. But he's gonna

39:52.304 --> 39:53.260
No, wait.

39:53.304 --> 39:54.869
Before that...

39:54.913 --> 39:56.913
I have a better idea.

39:59.521 --> 40:01.260
