WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:09.583 --> 00:11.000
(knock on door)

00:15.792 --> 00:17.333
SHELDON.

00:17.375 --> 00:20.041
SHH. SHH. SHH.
DON'T SCARE THE ERECTION.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.166
IT'S UP, VIOLET. FULL MAST.

00:22.208 --> 00:24.875
I... (whispers) I THOUGHT
YOU JUST WANTED TO BE FRIENDS.

00:24.917 --> 00:26.834
I DID,
BUT A WEEK OF FRIENDSHIP...

00:26.875 --> 00:29.667
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M OVER
MY ISSUE, SO... (chuckles)

00:29.709 --> 00:32.041
IS--IS THIS OKAY?

00:32.083 --> 00:35.250
OH, GOD.
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.875
I-I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.000
(Cooper) HOLD IT!

00:52.709 --> 00:55.709
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE DIED.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.709
DYING. BIG DADDY.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.709
BIG DADDY?
WELL, THAT IS A SCREEN NAME.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.208
WHEN YOU GET BACK
ON THE HORSE,

01:02.250 --> 01:05.041
YOU REALLY GET BACK
ON THE HORSE, HUH?
COOPER--

01:05.083 --> 01:08.208
WHAT'S KILLING HIM, THE--THE SEX
OR THE COLD-FISH ATTITUDE?
BIG DADDY'S MY FATHER.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.000
(elevator bell dings)

01:17.208 --> 01:19.041
HEY.

01:19.083 --> 01:20.250
HEY.

01:20.291 --> 01:23.041
SO, UH... KEVIN'S BACK
AT MY PLACE.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.625
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.041
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.125
IT'S ALL NEGOTIATION
AND AWKWARDNESS,

01:31.166 --> 01:33.458
BUT IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.625
UH, SAM HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.750
MAYA HUNG OUT LAST NIGHT
WITH HER AT SAM'S.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.917
OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
NO, NO, NO, IT'S GOOD.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.917
OH.
NO, NO, NO. NO, IT'S GOOD.

01:41.959 --> 01:43.792
OH.
YEAH.

01:45.709 --> 01:48.625
WHY DO YOU TWO
LOOK LIKE THAT?

01:48.667 --> 01:50.959
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.542
YEAH.
(scoffs)

01:55.166 --> 01:57.041
WHAT?

01:57.083 --> 02:00.041
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS NICE.
OH, THANKS.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.709
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
WELL, THAT'S--

02:02.750 --> 02:04.709
GOOD.
(Addison) IT'S GOOD.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.583
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.500
GOOD MORNING.

02:09.542 --> 02:12.375
WHO CALLS THEIR FATHER
"BIG DADDY"?

02:12.417 --> 02:15.250
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE
"CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF."

02:15.291 --> 02:17.542
IT'S LIKE...
CHARLOTTE KING DOES.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.500
SHE ACTUALLY CALLS HER FATHER
BIG DADDY? (laughs)
(laughs) YES.

02:19.542 --> 02:23.500
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S DYING,
AND, I MADE A JERK OF MYSELF

02:23.542 --> 02:25.542
IN FRONT OF CHARLOTTE
BECAUSE I WAS LAUGHING.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.750
NICE MOVE.
SHOULD I DO SOMETHING?

02:27.792 --> 02:29.500
(Violet)
YEAH, WALK AWAY, COOPER.

02:29.542 --> 02:32.291
BIG DADDY IS NOT
YOUR PROBLEM.
(baby babbles)

02:32.333 --> 02:34.625
YOU HAVE ANOTHER KID THAT
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

02:34.667 --> 02:37.000
FUNNY. THIS IS JULIAN.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.834
IT'S THE C.F. FAMILY, SAM.
CHAMP, COME HERE.

02:39.875 --> 02:43.208
IT IS JUST WRONG--
A SINGLE FATHER, TWO KIDS,

02:43.250 --> 02:45.375
AND ALL OF THEM HAVE
CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

02:45.417 --> 02:49.583
AND, UH, JULIAN'S FATHER
DOESN'T SOUND SO GOOD.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.834
(Addison) HEY, YOU TWO.
IS IT PHOTOGRAPHY DAY?

02:55.875 --> 02:57.834
YEAH, I GOT GRACIE
A CAMERA FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.000
SHE'S, UH, BEEN TAKING PICTURES
OF EVERYTHING.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.417
(Addison laughs) OH.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.542
OH.
SURE.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.667
I'M MAKING A SCRAPBOOK.
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

03:05.709 --> 03:08.041
WHEN I DON'T FEEL GOOD,
IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.542
WELL, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.583
DO YOU WANT TO BE FIRST?
I'LL KEEP YOUR DAD ENTERTAINED
WITH SOME PERCUSSION THERAPY.

03:13.625 --> 03:17.542
WHERE YOU BEAT ME HEALTHY?
OR WE CAN LET ADDISON DO
THE BRONCHOSCOPY LAVAGE.

03:17.583 --> 03:20.458
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET
YOUR LABS DONE,

03:20.500 --> 03:23.125
GET YOU OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS WE CAN.
YOU GONNA BE OKAY
ON YOUR OWN, KIDDO?

03:23.166 --> 03:26.000
DAD, I'M 9.
(coughing)

03:27.500 --> 03:29.625
ALL RIGHT, ANY DIZZINESS
OR SLURRED SPEECH?
NO.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.834
YES.
SETH.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.458
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL MY SON
THAT I'M FINE?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.041
YOU STILL HAVE WEAKNESS
ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE

03:35.083 --> 03:37.583
AND A PERSISTENT
VISUAL FIELD DEFECT.

03:37.625 --> 03:41.583
I'M CONCERNED.
YEAH, TELL HER
SHE NEEDS TO MOVE.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.250
I'M NOT MOVING TO FLORIDA.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU THERE.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.834
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF HERE, RIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE STILL AT RISK
FOR ANOTHER STROKE.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.166
YOU SHOULD BE WITH SOMEONE.
ARE YOU GANGING UP ON ME?

03:50.208 --> 03:52.709
SINCE DAD DIED, YOU BARELY
WANT TO TALK ON THE PHONE.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.709
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
IT IS.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.709
HE THINKS I'M DEPRESSED.
I'M NOT.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.500
I HAVE FRIENDS.
I'M NOT ALONE.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.500
THEY'RE NOT FAMILY.
YOU SHOULD BE WITH FAMILY.
THIS IS A BIG DECISION.

04:01.542 --> 04:05.250
DECIDING TO MOVE,
UPROOT YOUR LIFE--IT'S HUGE.

04:05.291 --> 04:08.041
BUT LOSING A SPOUSE
IS HUGE, TOO.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.625
DO ME A FAVOR, CYNTHIA.
SPEAK WITH OUR THERAPIST?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.083
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE.
(sighs)

04:16.083 --> 04:18.041
I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY WITH IT,

04:18.083 --> 04:20.709
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF I AM OKAY WITH IT.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.125
I'M SLEEPING WITH TWO MEN.
DO I GET A LECTURE NOW?

04:23.166 --> 04:25.250
YES.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.000
YES, YOU DO.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.083
THIS IS GOOD.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.625
THIS IS PROGRESS.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.041
REALLY?
THAT'S MY LECTURE?

04:36.083 --> 04:38.625
IT'S FUN, IT'S EXCITING,
IT'S... CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.542
SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT?

04:40.583 --> 04:44.041
BECAUSE THE WEIRD THING IS,
I'M OKAY WITH IT,

04:44.083 --> 04:46.291
E-EXCEPT FOR THE PART OF ME
THAT THINKS I SHOULDN'T BE,

04:46.333 --> 04:49.750
BUT--BUT I-I THINK I AM.
SEX IS GOOD.
RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.333
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE WHAT CAUSE PEOPLE

04:51.375 --> 04:54.166
TO BE COLD AND LYING
AND DECEITFUL.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.959
I MEAN, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE A THERAPIST.
O-OKAY, PROFESSIONALLY,
I WOULD DISPUTE THAT

04:57.000 --> 04:58.959
AND SUGGEST THAT YOU NEED
TO SEE YOUR OWN THERAPIST.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.041
BUT PERSONALLY? YES.
AS A RED-BLOODED AMERICAN,
SEX IS YOUR BIRTHRIGHT.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.959
GO FORTH, ENJOY--GUILT-FREE.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.709
I WILL.
I WILL EXERCISE MY RIGHT.
(door opens)

05:08.750 --> 05:12.166
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
THE C.F. RESULTS ARE BACK.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.625
HOW BAD?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.041
IF THIS--
IF THIS IS, UH,

05:18.083 --> 05:20.041
IF THIS IS SERIOUS,
IF I'M GONNA DIE,

05:20.083 --> 05:23.750
PLEASE JUST TELL ME NOW.
DARON, YOUR TESTS
CAME BACK FINE.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.208
IT'S, UM, IT'S GRACIE.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.208
SHE TESTED POSITIVE
FOR BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.709
IT'S A BACTERIA
THAT GETS IN--

05:30.750 --> 05:33.792
YEAH, I-I-I KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.709
I'M SORRY.
NO. IT'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF A MISTAKE.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.625
I MEAN, SHE LOOKS FINE.
LOOK AT HER.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.709
Y-YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
THAT HER LUNG FUNCTION'S

05:41.750 --> 05:44.959
GONNA START GOING DOWNHILL.
FROM HER TEST RESULTS,
IT APPEARS THAT IT ALREADY HAS.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.500
YOU KNOW HOW CONTAGIOUS

05:46.542 --> 05:48.500
THIS BACTERIA CAN BE
FOR C.F. PATIENTS.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.792
IT'S A MIRACLE THAT YOU
AND JULIAN HAVEN'T CAUGHT IT.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.583
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW
IS GET GRACIE TO THE HOSPITAL,

05:53.625 --> 05:56.041
GET HER INTO ISOLATION
WHILE WE FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.041
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.I'LL--I'LL,
UM, I'LL TAKE HER THERE NOW.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.208
NO, DARON,
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.583
YOU CAN'T TOUCH HER,
YOU CAN'T BE WITH HER

06:03.625 --> 06:05.625
OR YOU'LL DIE.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.583
I'M NOT BEING STUBBORN.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.417
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.375
MOVING TO A NEW CITY
AT ANY AGE IS STRESSFUL.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.625
BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE,
LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.625
COULD THIS MOVE
BE GOOD FOR YOU?

06:26.667 --> 06:29.166
I CAN'T MOVE.

06:29.208 --> 06:34.041
AND I CAN'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT WHY I CAN'T MOVE.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.667
AND...

06:35.709 --> 06:40.166
HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.000
(voice breaking) AND NOW...

06:42.041 --> 06:44.625
NOW HE HAS SAM
ON HIS SIDE.

06:44.667 --> 06:48.625
WELL, YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.291
NO.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.709
IF SETH
FINDS OUT THE TRUTH,

06:52.750 --> 06:54.625
HE'S GOING TO HATE ME.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.375
CYNTHIA, ANYTHING YOU TELL ME
STAYS WITH ME.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.959
LET ME HELP YOU.
TALK TO ME.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.041
YOU CAN'T EVEN...

07:04.083 --> 07:06.000
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL SAM.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.875
IF I CAN'T COME NEAR YOU,

07:10.917 --> 07:13.500
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME?

07:13.542 --> 07:16.750
WELL, WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT, HONEY. OKAY? I PROMISE.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.875
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO

07:18.917 --> 07:21.875
TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH DR. FREEDMAN, OKAY?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.834
SHE NEEDS ME.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.542
YOU CAN'T PUT YOURSELF
AT RISK, OR JULIAN.

07:31.583 --> 07:35.041
IF EITHER OF YOU GETS EXPOSED,
THIS WILL KILL YOU.

07:35.083 --> 07:38.125
SO I JUST LEAVE HER ALONE?
ISN'T THERE A FAMILY MEMBER
YOU COULD CALL,

07:38.166 --> 07:41.375
SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP YOU,
WHO COULD BE WITH GRACIE?
I GOT A SISTER IN NASHVILLE,

07:41.417 --> 07:44.166
BUT SHE DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW GRACIE.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.375
LOOK, GRACIE NEEDS ME.
OKAY? I NEED HER.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.875
(sighs) SHE'S ALREADY
LOST HER MOTHER, YOU KNOW?

07:48.917 --> 07:51.041
I'M--I'M--
I'M ALL SHE HAS.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.041
LOOK, I-I-I COULD WEAR
A MASK, RIGHT?

07:53.083 --> 07:55.041
WE, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.917
DARON, IF YOU LIVE TOGETHER,
YOU WILL GET THIS,

07:57.959 --> 08:00.083
AND THERE IS NO WAY
WE CAN TREAT IT.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.041
WELL, I NEED TO BE THERE
FOR BOTH OF THEM.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.625
YOU KNOW, THEY BOTH NEED ME.

08:07.792 --> 08:10.959
(voice breaks)
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE?

08:15.959 --> 08:17.500
(elevator bell dings)

08:17.542 --> 08:19.041
(indistinct conversations)

08:19.083 --> 08:22.041
I'LL BE BACK.
OKAY, TAKE CARE.

08:23.458 --> 08:26.625
HEY, HOW'S, UH,
HOW'S GRACIE?

08:26.667 --> 08:29.583
OH, UH, YOU KNOW, NOT GOOD.
SHE'S TRYING TO BE BRAVE,

08:29.625 --> 08:31.291
BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THE HOSPITAL...
THANK YOU.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.500
AND I DON'T THINK THAT
SHE REALLY UNDERSTANDS

08:33.542 --> 08:35.959
THAT NOT SEEING HER DAD
OR HER BROTHER,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.291
NOT LIVING WITH THEM,
THAT'S PERMANENT.
MM.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.750
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
TO CHARLOTTE ABOUT?
OH, SHE ASKED ME TO DO
HER NEONATAL ROUNDS

08:41.792 --> 08:47.041
WHILE SHE GOES TO ALABAMA
TO SEE HER DAD.
WHAT, LIKE YOU OWE HER A FAVOR
AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO US?

08:47.083 --> 08:49.000
COOPER, HER FATHER IS DYING.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.709
(speaks indistinctly)

09:00.083 --> 09:03.041
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR DAD.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED...

09:03.083 --> 09:06.041
I'M FINE. I SEE DEATH
EVERY DAY ON THE JOB.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.792
IT'S A PART OF LIFE,
AND I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.000
I'M LATE FOR MY FLIGHT.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.834
CYNTHIA IS FULLY CAPABLE
OF MAKING DECISIONS

09:14.875 --> 09:18.041
ABOUT HER OWN CARE.
AND YOU'RE NOT AT ALL CONCERNED
THAT A 70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

09:18.083 --> 09:20.583
STILL RECOVERING
FROM A STROKE

09:20.625 --> 09:23.625
IS PUTTING HERSELF FURTHER
AT RISK BY LIVING ALONE?
SAM, YOU ASKED ME
TO EVALUATE HER.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.625
YES.
SO SHE'S NOT DEPRESSED,
SHE IS NOT CLINGING IRRATIONALLY

09:26.667 --> 09:28.250
TO HER INDEPENDENCE.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.875
SHE HAS LEGITIMATE REASONS
FOR WHAT SHE'S DOING.

09:30.917 --> 09:33.041
WHICH ARE?
PRIVILEGED.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.041
(groans)

09:36.083 --> 09:37.250
HEY.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.500
HEY.

09:38.542 --> 09:39.458
UM...

09:39.500 --> 09:43.041
I THINK IT'S CONFUSING
TO MAYA,

09:43.083 --> 09:46.583
MEETING A WOMAN THAT YOU'VE
JUST STARTED TO DATE.
WHAT?

09:46.625 --> 09:49.625
I THINK MEETING A NEW GIRLFRIEND
COULD BE... SCARY FOR HER.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.041
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH SONYA?

09:52.083 --> 09:55.291
NO, NO.
YOU DATE WHOMEVER YOU WANT.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.000
JUST, UH, THINK ABOUT
HOW THIS AFFECTS MAYA.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.917
OOH! OH.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.667
THAT WAS ALMOST
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.417
NOT IN THE MOOD.

10:14.458 --> 10:18.083
CUTE KID.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.083
WHAT, I CAN'T FEEL
FOR A PATIENT?

10:20.125 --> 10:22.166
TRY ME.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.750
9 YEAR OLD
WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.041
RARE BACTERIAL INFECTION
IN HER LUNGS.

10:27.083 --> 10:30.041
FATHER CAN'T BE WITH HER ANYMORE
BECAUSE HE HAS C.F., TOO,

10:30.083 --> 10:32.375
SAME THING
WITH HER 2-YEAR-OLD BROTHER,

10:32.417 --> 10:35.041
BECAUSE IF EITHER OF THEM GET
INFECTED WITH THE BACTERIA,

10:35.083 --> 10:36.667
THEY'LL DIE.

10:36.709 --> 10:40.083
SO FATHER HAS TO CHOOSE--
LET HIS GIRL DIE ALONE

10:40.125 --> 10:44.542
OR STAY WITH HER AND LEAVE
A 2 YEAR OLD WITH C.F. BEHIND.

10:44.583 --> 10:47.542
BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA?

10:49.125 --> 10:50.125
WHAT?

10:50.166 --> 10:52.083
I--I'VE HAD CANCER PATIENTS
MANIFEST

10:52.125 --> 10:55.125
THE SAME BACTERIAL COMPLICATIONS
AS THOSE WITH B. CEPACIA.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.125
I'VE HAD SUCCESS
ERADICATING THE INFECTION.
OKAY, NO ONE IN THE WORLD

10:58.166 --> 11:00.208
HAS FOUND A CURE
FOR CEPACIA SYNDROME,

11:00.250 --> 11:03.000
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
PITCH ME ONE?

11:03.041 --> 11:05.542
I KNOW CANCER'S A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN CYSTIC FIBROSIS,

11:05.583 --> 11:07.542
AND THE BACTERIA
IS MORE DRUG RESISTANT.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.208
I JUST...

11:09.250 --> 11:14.709
IT'S A TRAGIC STORY.
WORTH A SHOT.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.000
WHY WOULD YOU HELP ME?
I'M A DOCTOR.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.709
SO...

11:22.750 --> 11:24.417
I'VE SPOKEN
TO YOUR MOTHER, SETH,

11:24.458 --> 11:28.750
AND, UM,
SHE IS NOT READY TO MOVE.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.625
MOM--

11:30.667 --> 11:33.542
SETH, PLEASE, YOU WON'T
LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO HER.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.041
SHE UNDERSTANDS YOUR CONCERNS.
SHE HAS AGREED TO COME IN

11:36.083 --> 11:39.125
FOR WEEKLY CHECKUPS WITH SAM
AND COUNSELING WITH ME

11:39.166 --> 11:41.667
AND TO PUT A MEDIC ALERT SYSTEM
IN HER HOUSE.

11:41.709 --> 11:45.417
AND IF HER CONDITION WORSENS,
THEN WE CAN ALWAYS REVISIT THIS.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.291
I PROMISED...

11:49.667 --> 11:53.458
I PROMISED DAD...
I WOULD TAKE CARE OF YOU.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.417
MOST OF MY FRIENDS,

11:55.458 --> 11:58.458

MOVING IN IS TERRIFYING.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.041

SETH--

12:01.083 --> 12:04.667
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT
TO PUT YOU IN A HOME.
PLEASE, SETH.
STOP PUSHING ME.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.709

YOU HATE THE CITY.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.625

YOU HATE THE CRIME--

12:09.667 --> 12:11.458

12:11.500 --> 12:14.709

12:14.750 --> 12:17.041
(Sam) CALL 9-1-1.
GET AN AMBULANCE, PLEASE.

12:17.083 --> 12:21.458
IS SHE HAVING ANOTHER STROKE?
IS SHE HAVING ANOTHER STROKE?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.667
IT WAS A TRANSIENT
ISCHEMIC ATTACK--

12:23.709 --> 12:26.041
PRESS--
A WARNING SIGN FOR A STROKE.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.208
IT HAPPENED

12:28.250 --> 12:30.083

21:17.500 --> 21:20.709
NOW WE JUST NEED ONE OF THESE
TO STAY CLEAR,

21:20.750 --> 21:23.041
AND THEN WE'LL KNOW THAT
THE BACTERIA IS SENSITIVE

21:23.083 --> 21:24.959
TO THAT COMBINATION
OF ANTIBIOTICS.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.041
BY MORNING WE SHOULD KNOW,
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.041
WANT TO GRAB A BITE?

21:30.083 --> 21:31.583
ACTUALLY, I AM STARVED,

21:31.625 --> 21:35.041
BUT I AM SUPPOSED TO,
UM... MEET SOMEONE.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.917
AHH. THE COP.

21:36.959 --> 21:38.667
YES, THE COP.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.041
SO YOU REALLY THINK
A HOT DATE AND FINE DINING

21:41.083 --> 21:43.375
IS BETTER THAN A GUY
YOU CAN BARELY STAND

21:43.417 --> 21:46.000
AND CAFETERIA MAC AND CHEESE?
(laughs) WELL...

21:46.041 --> 21:49.959
I DO LOVE THE MAC AND CHEESE.

21:52.709 --> 21:54.875
FROM A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL
STANDPOINT,

21:54.917 --> 21:57.041
THIS IS REMARKABLE.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.667
WHAT IS?
YOU. WHAT YOU DO TO ME.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.875
ALL DAY I COULDN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.208
AND--AND EVER SINCE
YOU CALLED, I...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.041
(laughs)

22:13.542 --> 22:16.041
I REMEMBER THIS TASTING
A LOT BETTER.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.500
I DON'T KNOW.
IT TAKES ME BACK.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.709
TO RESIDENCY, YOU KNOW,
WHEN LIFE WAS SIMPLE.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.625
SEE, I HAVE A HARD TIME
PICTURING YOU AS AN INTERN,

22:23.667 --> 22:26.041
TAKING CRAP
FROM YOUR ATTENDING.
BY YEAR TWO,
THEY ALL HATED ME.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.083
OH, IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG?
(laughs) SORRY.

22:28.125 --> 22:31.333
NO, NO. IT'S JUST, UH, YEAH,
THEY REALLY HATED ME.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.709
(laughs)
SO'D MY WIFE.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.917
YOU'RE MARRIED?

22:35.959 --> 22:37.208
WAS.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.625
THE DIVORCE TOOK TWO YEARS,
FOUR LAWYERS,

22:39.667 --> 22:41.625
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS.

22:41.667 --> 22:44.959
WE--WE DISCUSSED ASSETS,
PROPERTY, MONEY, THE DOG.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.041
BUT NOT ONCE...
IN ALL THAT TIME

22:48.083 --> 22:50.000
DID ANYONE EVER ASK ME
ABOUT LOVE.

22:54.709 --> 22:57.041
I'M STILL BITTER...

22:57.083 --> 22:58.834
ABOUT THE DOG.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.250
I GET WHAT BITTER DOES.

23:01.291 --> 23:05.208
YOU HAVE ALL THAT LOVE,
AND THEN... WHERE DOES IT GO?

23:05.250 --> 23:07.834
YOU, TOO?
MEMBER OF THE CLUB.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.792
SO I'M GONNA ASK THIS AGAIN,

23:10.834 --> 23:14.458
BUT THIS TIME,
PRETEND YOU THINK I'M HUMAN.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.083
YOU WANT TO MAYBE
HAVE DINNER WITH ME SOMETIME?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.417
A DATE?

23:20.458 --> 23:23.041
I... DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

23:23.083 --> 23:26.834
IS IT 'CAUSE IT'S ME
OR BECAUSE OF THE COP?

23:29.208 --> 23:32.000
THINK ABOUT IT.

23:41.083 --> 23:44.875
(sighs)

23:44.917 --> 23:46.875
NAI?

23:46.917 --> 23:50.250
(whispers) OH, GOD. SHH.
I AM NOT HERE.

23:50.291 --> 23:54.125
THIS IS NOT JEALOUSY.
THIS IS CONCERN FOR MY DAUGHTER.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.458
NAI, REMEMBER WHEN
MAYA TOLD YOU--

23:57.500 --> 23:59.625
REMEMBER WHEN MAYA TOLD YOU
TO GET A LIFE?

23:59.667 --> 24:02.667
I HAVE A LIFE. I HAVE A--
I HAVE A GREAT LIFE.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.667
I'M JUST--
STANDING HERE ON MY PATIO
IN THE DARK

24:05.709 --> 24:09.458
SPYING ON YOUR EX, HIS
GIRLFRIEND AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.917
I'M BEING REPLACED.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.709
AWW.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.709
SONYA IS MY REPLACEMENT.
THAT'S MAYA'S NEW MOMMY.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.917
OH. SHH.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.917
OH, I AM FREAKING--

24:29.959 --> 24:31.917
OH, GOD. IGNORE ME.
IGNORE ME.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.458
I'M JUST FREAKING OUT.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.709
THANK YOU.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.709
WHY AREN'T--WHY AREN'T YOU
OUT WITH KEVIN?

24:38.750 --> 24:41.959
(scoffs) IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE MARRIED, NAOMI.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.375
I DON'T HAVE TO BE WITH HIM
EVERY NIGHT.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.500
I DON'T HAVE TO CALL
OR CHECK IN,

24:46.542 --> 24:48.959
AND IF I WANT TO TALK
TO ANOTHER MAN,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.792
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
PROMISE RINGS OR ANYTHING.

24:51.834 --> 24:55.041
WHO IS IT, THIS OTHER MAN?

24:55.083 --> 24:56.709
OH, NO...

24:56.750 --> 24:59.959
(sighs) WYATT ASKED ME OUT
ON A DATE.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.041
OH.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.709
HE'S...

25:04.750 --> 25:06.709
DIFFERENT THAN I THOUGHT.

25:06.750 --> 25:10.417
OKAY, WELL, UM,
CAN I JUST SAY THAT, UH,

25:10.458 --> 25:12.917
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP,
SO, YOU KNOW...

25:12.959 --> 25:14.417
(pats Addison's leg)
KNEES TOGETHER.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.375
NO, I AM NOT A CHEATER.

25:16.417 --> 25:19.375
OKAY, I'VE DONE THAT.
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT AGAIN.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.375
I DON'T KNOW. BUT I DO WANT
TO SAY YES TO THE DATE.

25:22.417 --> 25:25.417
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW. SHOULD I?
I SHOULDN'T. SHOULD I?

25:25.458 --> 25:28.375
OH.
WE ARE SO SCREWED UP.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.417
(sighs)

25:42.083 --> 25:44.625
THIS IS A NICE PLACE.

25:44.667 --> 25:47.000
CRAZY HUMID.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.542
HI.

26:01.917 --> 26:04.875
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:04.917 --> 26:06.375
LUNG CANCER.

26:06.417 --> 26:11.500
DOCTORS GAVE HIM SIX MONTHS
TWO YEARS AGO.

26:11.542 --> 26:15.041
HE WENT INTO RESPIRATORY FAILURE
LAST WEEK.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.041
HOW YOU HOLDIN' UP?

26:17.083 --> 26:19.166
WELL, LET'S SEE...

26:19.208 --> 26:21.166
DUKE AND LANDRY
ARE DOWNING BOURBON,

26:21.208 --> 26:23.250
MAMA'S TAKEN TO HER ROOM
WITH THE VAPORS,

26:23.291 --> 26:25.583
AND NOT A ONE OF 'EM
WANTS ANY PART

26:25.625 --> 26:27.917
OF MAKING A DECISION
ABOUT BIG DADDY.
THE VAPORS?

26:27.959 --> 26:29.917
YOU HAVE A MEDICAL DEGREE
FROM JOHNS HOPKINS.

26:29.959 --> 26:34.041
YOU'VE DIAGNOSED YOUR MOTHER
WITH THE VAPORS.
SHE'S A DRUG ADDICT, COOPER.

26:34.083 --> 26:37.041
BUT HERE IN DIXIE,
WE'RE MORE POLITE ABOUT IT.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.625
(sighs)

26:38.667 --> 26:40.625
WHAT?

26:40.667 --> 26:43.208
WHY ARE YOU HERE, COOPER,
IN THE MIDDLE

26:43.250 --> 26:45.709
OF MY SOUTHERN
GOTHIC TRAGEDY?

26:45.750 --> 26:47.333
I CAME FOR YOU.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.041
(beeping continues)

26:52.083 --> 26:55.041
(sighs) LANDRY WAS SUPPOSED
TO PULL THE PLUG THIS MORNING,

26:55.083 --> 26:56.625
COULDN'T DO IT.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.667
DUKE CAN'T EVEN
COME IN THE ROOM.

26:58.709 --> 27:01.166
SO IT'S JUST YOU.

27:01.208 --> 27:03.041
JUST ME.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.458
HE'S NOT EVEN THERE ANYMORE.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.166
IT'S JUST... THE ETHICAL,

27:08.208 --> 27:11.709
MORAL, MEDICALLY CORRECT
THING TO DO.

27:11.750 --> 27:15.125
PULL THE PLUG
AND... IT'S DONE.

27:15.166 --> 27:18.166
(beeping continues)

27:25.375 --> 27:27.083
AH.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.041
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:29.083 --> 27:31.000
NO, NOT REALLY.

27:32.542 --> 27:34.083
SO I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX,

27:34.125 --> 27:37.583
LOTS AND LOTS
AND LOTS OF SEX.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.375
YES, WITH PETE.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.125
AND WITH SHELDON,
MANY TIMES.

27:42.166 --> 27:46.083
MANY, MANY... MANY TIMES.

27:46.125 --> 27:49.166
(whispers)
AND I'M IN PAIN.

27:49.208 --> 27:52.041
AND I CAN'T STOP PEEING.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.625
YOU NEED ADDISON.

27:53.667 --> 27:56.625
YOU'VE GOT HONEYMOON CYSTITIS
FROM TOO MUCH SEX.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.917
SO I WILL PRESCRIBE YOU
AN ANTIBIOTIC

27:58.959 --> 28:00.834
AND SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

28:00.875 --> 28:04.041
VIOLET TURNER, I AM
YOUR FRIEND, AND I KNOW YOU.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.500
SLEEPING WITH SHELDON
AND PETE IS NOT YOU.
OH, COME ON.

28:07.542 --> 28:10.083
WHEN COOPER DOES IT,
HE GETS A SLAP ON THE BACK

28:10.125 --> 28:12.375
AND AN ATTABOY,
BUT WHEN I DO IT--

28:12.417 --> 28:16.041
WHEN--WHEN A WOMAN TAKES CONTROL
OF HER SEXUALITY, SHE'S A WHORE.

28:16.083 --> 28:19.333
YOU ARE JUST NOT THAT PERSON.
SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE.

28:19.375 --> 28:22.333
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE
AVOIDING SOMETHING OR IN DENIAL.

28:22.375 --> 28:23.792
SOMETHING PSYCHOLOGICAL.
I DON'T KNOW.

28:23.834 --> 28:26.041
YOU'RE THE THERAPIST.
YOU KNOW.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.125
AND YOU KNOW
THAT THIS IS NOT GOOD.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.041
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
JUST TO FIGURE OUT

28:31.083 --> 28:34.041
WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO BE WITH?
HOW CAN I CHOOSE?
I MEAN, PETE IS...

28:34.083 --> 28:36.000
PETE'S ALL HEAT.

28:36.041 --> 28:38.208
I JUST SEE HIM, AND I MELT.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.041
AND SHELDON IS COMFORT.

28:41.083 --> 28:44.041
LIKE MAC AND CHEESE.
WHAT?

28:44.083 --> 28:47.166
DO YOU THINK THIS IS OKAY,
WHAT SHE'S DOING?
I THINK THAT IT'S HARD

28:47.208 --> 28:50.083
TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THE RIGHT PERSON IS.
THANK YOU.

28:50.125 --> 28:52.083
YEAH, I MEAN, KEVIN'S GREAT,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

28:52.125 --> 28:55.041
IS--IS HE THE ONE
OR IS IT SOMEONE ELSE?

28:55.083 --> 28:58.041
I WANT TO BE OKAY WITH
THIS SONYA THING. I DO, I DO.

28:58.083 --> 29:00.542
BUT I-I DON'T THINK I CARE THAT
SAM IS DATING, BUT DO I CARE?

29:00.583 --> 29:03.458
AM I IN DENIAL? NO, NO,
THIS IS ABOUT MAYA, RIGHT?

29:03.500 --> 29:06.041
I'M NOT CRAZY. THIS IS
ABOUT MAYA. I'M NOT CRAZY.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.750
DOES THIS REALLY LOOK LIKE
THE TIME FOR THERAPY?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.667
(groans)

29:15.083 --> 29:17.291
OH, HEY.
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.500
I-I JUST CAME
TO PICK UP MY LAPTOP.

29:19.542 --> 29:23.542
I LEFT IT YESTERDAY
WHEN I RAN OUT.
YOUR MOTHER NEEDS YOU.
SHE IS WILLING TO MOVE

29:23.583 --> 29:26.291
ALL THE WAY TO FLORIDA
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.291
THINK ABOUT IT, SETH.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.083
THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

29:31.125 --> 29:33.083
THE ONLY THING I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO THINK ABOUT

29:33.125 --> 29:36.041
IS HOW STUPID I WAS
NOT TO HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT.
WELL, SHE WANTED TO TELL YOU.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.041
SHE WAS JUST AFRAID THAT
YOU WOULDN'T ACCEPT HER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
ABOUT ACCEPTING HER.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.291
YOU THINK I CAN'T ACCEPT
THAT SHE'S GAY?

29:41.333 --> 29:43.333
I'VE KNOWN ANNETTE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.083
NOW IT'S LIKE I'M--
I'M REPLAYING EVERY MOMENT,

29:45.125 --> 29:47.041
EVERY CHRISTMAS,
EVERY THANKSGIVING.

29:47.083 --> 29:50.083
YOU KNOW, I WAS IN
THE BACKYARD PLAYING FOOTBALL

29:50.125 --> 29:52.750
AND THEY WERE... (scoffs)
FOOLING AROUND.

29:52.792 --> 29:56.125
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
YOU THINK I WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT?

29:56.166 --> 29:58.291
AND MY DAD?

29:58.333 --> 30:01.333
SHE WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM.

30:01.375 --> 30:04.000
SHE BETRAYED HIM.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.542
SHE BETRAYED US.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.750
YOU'RE A FATHER.

30:07.792 --> 30:10.917
YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
IT IS TO BE A PARENT.

30:10.959 --> 30:13.000
YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS,

30:13.041 --> 30:16.083
SO YOU WANT TO DO EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO PROTECT THEM.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.500
SO YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S RIGHT TO TELL THEM

30:19.542 --> 30:21.500
AND WHAT'S RIGHT
TO KEEP FROM THEM.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.500
AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
GET IT RIGHT,

30:23.542 --> 30:25.542
BUT... YOU KNOW,
YOU DO YOUR BEST

30:25.583 --> 30:27.333
BECAUSE YOU LOVE THEM.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.166
YOU THINK
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER

30:29.208 --> 30:33.083
IF YOUR MOTHER HAD LEFT
YOUR FATHER WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

30:33.125 --> 30:36.333
SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER,

30:36.375 --> 30:39.625
TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE MOTHER
THAT YOU WANTED.
I DON'T KNOW HER.

30:39.667 --> 30:42.291
I FEEL NO CONNECTION
TO THAT WOMAN

30:42.333 --> 30:46.041
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HER
AT ALL.
SHE IS YOUR MOTHER, SETH.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.875
SHE WOULD GIVE UP EVERYTHING
FOR YOU.

30:50.208 --> 30:53.375
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE HAS GIVEN UP ENOUGH?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.500
I'M ALMOST AFRAID
TO COME IN HERE.

31:01.542 --> 31:04.417
WE JUST NEED ONE DISH
WITHOUT BACTERIAL GROWTH.

31:04.458 --> 31:07.166
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO SIMPLE.

31:22.417 --> 31:25.125
(exhales deeply)

31:25.166 --> 31:28.792
SO THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
INSIDE OF HER LUNGS.

31:28.834 --> 31:31.375
IT WAS A LONG SHOT.
YOU HAD TO TRY.

31:31.417 --> 31:33.041
WE HAD TO TRY.

31:33.083 --> 31:35.917
ADDISON--
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE DINNER.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.625
WHY? WHY, BECAUSE OF ME

31:38.667 --> 31:40.625
OR BECAUSE THE MIRACLE
DIDN'T WORK?

31:40.667 --> 31:42.667
I DON'T KNOW.

31:56.125 --> 31:57.917
HI.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.458
SAM JUST LEFT FOR ST. AMBROSE
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.667
OH, THANK YOU.
(chuckles)

32:03.709 --> 32:06.333
I GUESS PATIENT TRUMPS LUNCH.
(chuckles)

32:06.375 --> 32:08.250
LOOK, UM,

32:08.291 --> 32:11.250
WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A CHANCE
TO TALK THE OTHER NIGHT,

32:11.291 --> 32:14.250
AND, UM, I JUST WANTED TO--
NO, LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.750
IT'S ME
WHO SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

32:16.792 --> 32:19.458
I KNOW
IT MUST HAVE BEEN WEIRD,

32:19.500 --> 32:22.083
SEEING ME HANGING OUT
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

32:22.125 --> 32:26.083
I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WHEN MY MOM DATED.
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S--IT'S FINE.

32:26.125 --> 32:28.083
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

32:28.125 --> 32:30.542
THAT, UM... WHEREVER THIS IS
HEADING WITH SAM,

32:30.583 --> 32:33.041
I WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL
ABOUT MAYA'S FEELINGS.

32:33.083 --> 32:36.208
I GOT BURNED A FEW TIMES,
SO... I GET IT.
