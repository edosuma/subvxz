Agh! (GROANS)

00:17.400 --> 00:20.153

Well, let's get the girl inside.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.752
You could make this easier for yourself.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.951
Just tell me where she is.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.390
I left Lyra with you.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.080
I trusted you to look after her.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.111
She is here,

03:25.240 --> 03:26.639
or you know where she is.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.879
I wouldn't expect Boreal to understand
scholastic sanctuary,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.593
- but you...
- No, no, Master.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.234
I never, never understood it either.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.590
Why does scholarship need protecting?

03:39.680 --> 03:43.514
You don't believe original thinking
should be protected?

03:43.640 --> 03:47.190
Well, if the thinking was clever enough,

03:47.320 --> 03:53.032
it would find a way to obscure itself
from the Magisterium, wouldn't it?

03:55.920 --> 04:01.472
Scholastic sanctuary is just another way
of protecting bloated privilege.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.959
Tired old men talking in a tired old way
about tired old things.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.870
(LAUGHS) Oh, dear.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.150
And you, Master,

04:13.280 --> 04:17.160
you have been abusing your privilege.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.793
Do you deny they're yours?

04:21.240 --> 04:25.916
We do have ways of identifying
who last read them.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.713
Those are academic texts.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.798
- I have perfect right...
- These books are for those

04:30.920 --> 04:33.116
who read alethiometers.

04:33.240 --> 04:38.599
The only alethiometers in use
are sanctioned by the Magisterium.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.631
There is no record

04:40.760 --> 04:46.119
of there being an alethiometer
at Jordan College.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.230
Now, Lyra must be here,

04:56.360 --> 05:00.274
so tell me where she is
or I will find the alethiometer.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.118
You know I will.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.277
And if I find it...

05:04.400 --> 05:06.391
I no longer have it.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.709
And who does?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.753
(WHISPERS) Lyra.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.871
She arrived in my care with it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.718
I merely returned it to her.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.630
Tell me where she is...

05:29.040 --> 05:30.838
...or I will destroy all of this.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.713
I kept her safe in this college
for 12 years.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.751
I gave her to you to look after,

05:37.880 --> 05:39.473
and you lost her.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.031
You've already done the worst
you can possibly do.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.116
You heard him. Tear everything apart!

05:57.040 --> 05:58.917
Widen the search. She's not here.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.834
I've never seen so many Gyptians.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.234
Who are all of these people?

06:23.720 --> 06:26.792
The Gyptians aren't just in Oxford,
you know, Lyra.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.719
They've come from all over the country
to meet here in London

06:29.840 --> 06:31.513
to find the missing children.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.795
Tony, please, just explain
how you found her. From the beginning.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.672
We were just out getting supplies.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.359
What supplies?

06:51.480 --> 06:54.996
Well, there was this van,
and then there was someone driving it,

06:55.120 --> 06:57.236
and there was, like,
noises from the back -

06:57.360 --> 06:58.589
muffled screaming and that.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.270
Obviously, we was like,
"Yeah, we're going to have to stop it."

07:02.400 --> 07:04.710
So we chased it and got lucky.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.311
Tony rescued me, Ma Costa.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.359
- I don't understand.
- I was just out with the guys, Ma!

07:14.480 --> 07:15.800
Don't even think about lying to me,
Tony Costa,

07:15.920 --> 07:17.319
because you know you're not
very good at it.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.999
We got one!

07:19.120 --> 07:21.031
We've finally got a clue
to where Billy is!

07:23.120 --> 07:24.633
So close.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.835
Close isn't good enough, though, is it?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.075
It's something.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.394
It's a start.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.234
The start to beating them.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.551
- I will give you that.
- (DOOR OPENS)

07:45.640 --> 07:47.358
We need the girl.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.717
MA: It's all right.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.715
JOHN FAA: You've had a fortunate escape,
Lyra Belacqua,

08:16.840 --> 08:19.116
but now I ask you to help us.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.438
Did you have a sense of where
they were taking you?

08:23.560 --> 08:25.790
Is he not talking - the Gobbler?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.240
Not as yet.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.751
- So, anything you saw?
- I didn't know where I was,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.315
and I didn't know where
they were taking me.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.720
I'm sorry. I wish I could be of more help.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.549
Ma Costa has agreed to take you in,
so if we could talk again tomorrow...

08:42.679 --> 08:44.956
- You're keeping me here?
- For your own safety.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.753
We want to look after you.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.234
Why?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.112
I need to find my friend Roger!

08:50.240 --> 08:51.958
I don't know who you are!

08:52.080 --> 08:54.959
And as fun as it may seem
to stay a prisoner again...

08:55.080 --> 08:57.196
You may not know us,

08:57.320 --> 08:58.958
but we know you, Lyra.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.598
And have done since you were a baby.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.030
JOHN FAA: You are not our prisoner, Lyra,

09:06.160 --> 09:08.913
but you have always been
important to us.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.038
Is this because of my father?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.071
Because he's Lord Asriel?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.719
Who told you that?

09:18.840 --> 09:20.911
Your father was good to us.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.158
He has always respected our way of life.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.430
But you are special on your own account.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.630
Why?

09:27.760 --> 09:29.433
Frustrating as it may seem...

09:30.760 --> 09:33.229
...that's not a question for me to answer.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.795
I can't ask you to trust us, Lyra.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.150
I can only hope we'll earn your trust.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.400
We all want to find the missing children.
So...will you stay with us?

09:52.080 --> 09:55.550
The girl needs to be found.
Mrs Coulter's quite insistent on it.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.829
Any help that the Magisterium...

09:56.960 --> 09:59.634
Jordan College's sanctuary is long held

09:59.760 --> 10:02.229
and this morning disrupted.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.509
She did what she had to do.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.200
She did it badly and baldly.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.436
And she would happily bear consequence.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.357
Were you not part of this raid?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.199
And I will happily bear consequence too.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.718
As it turns out...

10:23.960 --> 10:25.394
...there's been developments.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.796
There's a rumour the Gyptians have her.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.558
The girl.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.354
And you're sending...?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.551
Officers are being dispatched now.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.231
The sooner this unseemly situation
is contained, the better.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.280
PAN: We can't run away from them.
You said you'd give them a chance.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.550
They know more about
the Gobblers than we do.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.798
We're more likely to find Roger
with them than on our own.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.072
Pan, how do you know we'll be safe here?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.838
They want to get their children back.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.272
I think we can trust them,

11:05.400 --> 11:06.913
and I never thought that about her.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.920
Well, I'll be better disguised
in their clothes than hers.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.433
Lyra, what do the symbols mean?

11:26.560 --> 11:30.155
It's clear that it means something,
but I have no idea what.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.558
(MECHANISM CLICKS)

11:36.200 --> 11:37.599
Lyra!

11:40.120 --> 11:42.953
Oh, look at you. You make a fine Gyptian.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.275
Much better.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.159
I'm cooking.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.839
Will you help?

11:51.560 --> 11:53.392
My friend Roger,

11:53.520 --> 11:55.477
he worked in kitchens.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.113
Never thought you should learn?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.197
- What good it do me?
- (LAUGHS)

11:59.320 --> 12:03.837
Oh, a Gyptian woman learns more than just
cooking in our kitchens, Lyra Belacqua.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.075
We're armed.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.278
There you go, girl!

12:09.400 --> 12:12.836
While you're stuck indoors,
we'll learn you some of our tricks.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.237
There! Lesson one learned already.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.158
You'll be a Gyptian woman yet.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.272
Is that what I'm going to be -
a Gyptian woman?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.718
You'll be whatever you want to be.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.159
Be your path.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.350
That's your choice...

12:32.520 --> 12:33.590
...and yours alone,

12:34.680 --> 12:36.796
I'm glad you're staying, Lyra.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.878
You'll be safe as houses here, you'll see.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.995
FARDAR: We're not like Mrs Coulter,
you know.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.993
We just want to keep you safe.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.077
Yeah, she said something similar
to me too.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.077
I'm sure she did.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.871
Maybe she even meant it,

14:13.000 --> 14:17.551
but maybe Mrs Coulter isn't as powerful
as she thinks.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.832
After all, you got away, didn't you?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.837
Although I still haven't got to the bottom

14:22.960 --> 14:24.917
of why she has a monkey daemon.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.112
Then again, I'm often confused by daemons.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.799
I would never have guessed

14:29.920 --> 14:32.639
Tony Costa's daemon would have
settled as a hawk.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.469
I think I'll settle as a mole.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.635
Oh.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.712
A mole, is it?

14:41.840 --> 14:45.470
Yes, so he can burrow underground
and stay safe from all you grown-ups.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.671
(CHUCKLES)

14:47.800 --> 14:49.598
Very sensible.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.833
But, er, not so good on the water, huh?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.519
Nowhere to burrow.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.916
(CHUCKLES)

15:00.680 --> 15:02.591
I don't want Pantalaimon to settle.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.351
I want him to be able to change for ever.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.278
And so does he.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.758
Well, there will come a time when you
will be tired of him changing.

15:13.880 --> 15:18.716
When you come of age, and your daemon
settles into its final form,

15:18.840 --> 15:22.196
it will reveal what kind of person
you really are.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.519
Suppose you don't like the shape
that your daemon settles as?

15:28.640 --> 15:34.556
Well, that would mean
you are discontented.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.433
Many people would like
to have a lion as a daemon...

15:38.800 --> 15:41.155
...and they end up with a poodle.

15:42.840 --> 15:47.391
No, I would not change a hair on Sophonax,

15:47.520 --> 15:52.469
but that is not to say that sometimes
I don't dream her different.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.794
Now...

16:07.120 --> 16:10.033
...would you like to see the man
who took you?

16:13.120 --> 16:17.478
BENJAMIN: You people think you're so
clever, but we found you, didn't we?

16:17.600 --> 16:22.231
There's no protection for you here.
Just me and you in a room.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.593
Tell me where they are.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.597
- (WHIMPERS)
- I know you know.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.758
Tell me where they are
and why you've taken them.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.632
FARDAR: Is this all right, Lyra?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.159
BENJAMIN: Tell me.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.112
Tell...me.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.358
He wanted to do worse to Roger and Billy.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.391
Why would they take them
and the other children

16:41.520 --> 16:43.272
if it wasn't to hurt them?

17:10.839 --> 17:12.990
THOMAS: Grumman isn't who you think he is.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.511
I ran a facial-recognition trace
based on your photo,

17:16.640 --> 17:20.190
whatever that was,
and I found a match.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.512
Colonel John Parry, 49th Commando.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.916
Former marine and explorer,
presumed dead around 13 years ago.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.758
He was lost in Alaska,

17:29.880 --> 17:33.714
supporting a government-funded
science expedition, environmental thing.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.877
He'd done a couple of gigs for them
before.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.359
Prior to that, he was 14 years
in the Royal Marines.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.438
<i>He was born here.</i>

17:44.560 --> 17:46.392
In my world.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.797
Charles, he didn't travel from your world
to mine.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.639
- He travelled from my world to yours.
- Not possible.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.956
He has a daemon, clearly, in the picture.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.277
No-one is born in this world
with a daemon.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.550
I don't think you know that.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.395
Maybe you acquire a daemon
when you cross, or...

18:10.520 --> 18:13.160
- Where precisely did he disappear?
- Look, this stuff was well locked up.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.794
Somebody didn't want just anybody
poking about. He was a colonel.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.231
But you're good, and you found out anyway.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.791
I traced his ship.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.478
Alaska.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.354
The Brooks Range.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.197
He's long gone from there by now.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.470
- This is of no use to me.
- OK.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.633
Maybe this might be.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.918
He left a wife...

18:47.040 --> 18:48.758
...and a child.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.714
I found them on voter registration.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.877
Maybe she'll know something.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.230
But she's not well. Medical records.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.478
She's had a long-term history
of mental health problems.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.958
This is a hard copy...

19:08.560 --> 19:11.234

19:14.920 --> 19:16.240
It's all there.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.596

19:21.720 --> 19:23.950

19:26.600 --> 19:29.035
It's just you, isn't it?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.876
Why did you never try to follow me?

19:36.160 --> 19:37.275
You could have.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.994
You know enough to have crossed behind me.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.475
You don't have the courage that's needed.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.150
You don't want to find a window,
because you're scared of it.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.509
It's true.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.319
I was scared, too.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.829
But I mastered my fear.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.440
I never thought that I was
the only person to cross.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.916
But until Stanislaus,
I never came across anyone

20:07.040 --> 20:10.032
who was fearless enough to have done it.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.798
I want to know what he knows,

20:15.920 --> 20:17.274
I want to know where he crosses

20:17.400 --> 20:19.914
and I want to know what he has seen.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.078
This is very helpful.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.553
I'll let myself out.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.471
Is he saying anything?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.399
He said she's taking them north,

21:14.520 --> 21:16.875
- but he doesn't know where.
- Of course.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.560
They can do anything
they want with them there.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.310
But I saw, in her study, plans, papers.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.195
- If we could just get to them...
- No! We are not going to Mrs Coulter!

21:27.320 --> 21:30.039
- Maybe we could...
- Mrs Coulter cannot know where we are.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.152

we'd risk her knowing everything.

26:11.040 --> 26:15.318
As a young man, Asriel, your father,
went exploring all over the North.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.078
He was high-spirited, quick to anger.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.589
Your ma, she was already married.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.633
As soon as they met, they fell in love.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.715
When she was pregnant with you,
they thought they could get away with it,

26:29.840 --> 26:33.549
but soon as you was born,
there was no hiding the Asriel in you.

26:35.640 --> 26:39.076
Your father had estates, so he put you
in the care of a Gyptian nurse.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.116
But Edward Coulter,
your mother's husband, followed,

26:44.240 --> 26:45.992

27:06.520 --> 27:08.557
Asriel killed defending his home,

27:08.680 --> 27:12.389
but the law also allows a man to avenge
the violation of his wife.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.151
Your ma was broken with the shame
of it all. It's why she's like she is.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.396
