That's me, Ariana Berlin.

00:15.557 --> 00:19.353
Gymnastics is my life.

00:15.557 --> 00:19.353
I've been doing it since I

00:15.557 --> 00:19.353
was three years old and

00:19.394 --> 00:21.396
I've never looked back.

00:22.982 --> 00:26.025
That's my best friend Isla.

00:22.982 --> 00:26.025
She and I used to choreograph

00:26.067 --> 00:29.070
our future olympic

00:26.067 --> 00:29.070
routines in our hallways.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.490
What? Normal

kids don't do that?

00:32.031 --> 00:36.620
My coaches always said

00:32.031 --> 00:36.620
that sometimes you have to fall

00:32.031 --> 00:36.620
before you can fly.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.833
I fell a lot.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.833
I trained a lot.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.494
qualify for the Olympic

11:13.672 --> 11:17.051
weeks for the bone to heal, then

11:17.093 --> 11:20.472
physical therapy for a few

11:17.093 --> 11:20.472
months. Luckily you're an

11:20.514 --> 11:24.934
athlete so I think the body

11:20.514 --> 11:24.934
is going to respond quickly.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.270
So I lose four, maybe five

11:24.976 --> 11:27.270
months, and then I can get back

11:27.312 --> 11:29.356
to training, right?

11:29.397 --> 11:33.360
Truth is, gymnastics is

11:29.397 --> 11:33.360
pretty much off the table.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.157
Honey, I'm so sorry.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.371
You don't know what you're

11:42.118 --> 11:44.371
talking about! I want another

11:44.412 --> 11:45.830
doctor! This is ridiculous.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.248
Calm down, honey.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.669
I, I can't sit in bed

11:47.290 --> 11:50.669
all day. I have to train.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.752
I'll see you outside.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
I need to go to the

11:51.794 --> 11:54.755
Olympics.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.714
It's ok.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.031
Want a gum?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.162
Nope, I'm

12:24.703 --> 12:26.162
good mom. Thanks for asking.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.206
No problem, anytime.

12:32.252 --> 12:32.835
Oh...

12:33.836 --> 12:34.753
What?

12:34.795 --> 12:35.380
Nothing.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.011
You know, Isla had a great floor

12:39.842 --> 12:42.011
routine

12:42.053 --> 12:47.267
and a perfect vault, but

12:42.053 --> 12:47.267
she did take that step  after

12:42.053 --> 12:47.267
the dismount from her bars.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.604
And, that's the difference

12:47.308 --> 12:50.604
between Gold and Silver.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.770
Yup.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.815
Somebody's in a mood.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.775
I'm not in a "mood".

12:58.027 --> 13:00.655
You know, you've had your

12:58.027 --> 13:00.655
pictures on the paper, too.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.407
Yes, I know, Mom.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.407
I especially liked the one of me

13:02.449 --> 13:04.451
unconscious in the hospital.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.872
You know, you were a lot

13:08.288 --> 13:09.872
more pleasant

13:09.914 --> 13:11.625
when you were unconscious.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.833
Touché.

13:13.876 --> 13:17.714
Ariana? Hey, I'll take you

13:13.876 --> 13:17.714
in. My name's Michelle and I'll

13:17.756 --> 13:21.384
be- okay. Uh, are you coming?

13:21.426 --> 13:24.763

13:29.892 --> 13:32.061

13:32.103 --> 13:34.230
I'm a physical therapy

22:23.467 --> 22:27.429
That's not right.

22:23.467 --> 22:27.429
He's gonna be sore tomorrow.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.212
Michelle. We up.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.297

So, you post all

24:53.575 --> 24:56.536
those videos online?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.664
Yup. It's a good way to

24:56.578 --> 24:58.664
promote.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.334
We usually get a

24:58.705 --> 25:01.334
few thousand hits.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.668
Wow.

25:02.709 --> 25:06.504
That's nothing. My goal is

25:02.709 --> 25:06.504
to get a million hits one day.

25:06.546 --> 25:10.050
So you're a champion dancer

25:06.546 --> 25:10.050
who runs a studio, and does

25:10.092 --> 25:14.472
physical therapy? And I

25:10.092 --> 25:14.472
thought I was an overachiever.

25:14.512 --> 25:19.477
I'm all about that hustle,

25:14.512 --> 25:19.477
baby. So... can you help us?

25:21.312 --> 25:23.563
Me? What could I

25:21.312 --> 25:23.563
possibly help you with?

25:23.605 --> 25:28.610
Well, there's this big

25:23.605 --> 25:28.610
talent management company called

25:23.605 --> 25:28.610
Crystal Image. C.I.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.030
They represent

25:28.652 --> 25:31.030
the best of the best.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.615
They hold auditions once

25:31.613 --> 25:33.615
a year, and anyone who

25:31.613 --> 25:33.615
gets in with them, is

25:33.657 --> 25:37.577
in with the money. Travel around

25:33.657 --> 25:37.577
the world, be on TV, tour with

25:37.619 --> 25:42.540
rock stars. You get the picture.

25:37.619 --> 25:42.540
Auditions are coming up soon.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.960
I still don't

25:42.791 --> 25:44.960
get what I can do.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.671
Well, they're looking for a

25:45.002 --> 25:47.671
dance crew with edge - some sort

25:47.713 --> 25:51.591
of unique special skill, and

25:47.713 --> 25:51.591
I was thinking since you have

25:51.633 --> 25:52.885
Olympic level experience -

25:52.926 --> 25:55.595
Michelle, first-off, I'm

25:52.926 --> 25:55.595
not Olympic level.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.765
Second, I've never danced

25:55.637 --> 25:58.765
hip-hop a day in my life.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.765
And third, even if both of

25:58.807 --> 26:01.810
those were the case, look at me.

26:02.644 --> 26:07.565
You look to me like you're

26:02.644 --> 26:07.565
ready to get moving

26:02.644 --> 26:07.565
again. Think about it.

26:20.662 --> 26:26.335
Mom, Dad, I'm

26:20.662 --> 26:26.335
home. Sorry I'm late.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.510
Alright, this little rift

26:32.799 --> 26:34.510
between you guys is hurting

26:34.552 --> 26:37.555
everyone, and it's hurting your

26:34.552 --> 26:37.555
recovery.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.560
So you're not leaving this room

26:38.931 --> 26:42.560
until everything is settled,

26:38.931 --> 26:42.560
okay?

26:53.779 --> 26:58.451
Look, I'm sorry about

26:53.779 --> 26:58.451
what you saw earlier today.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.994
I had no right coming

26:58.492 --> 27:00.994
back there unannounced.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.038
I know what it looked like.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.665
But I want you to

27:03.080 --> 27:05.665
know that it's nothing.

27:05.707 --> 27:09.086
Yeah, you're

27:05.707 --> 27:09.086
right. It is nothing.

27:09.128 --> 27:13.090
Listen Ariana. You can get

27:09.128 --> 27:13.090
back on your feet.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.008
You can get into UCLA.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.470
I have a metal

27:15.050 --> 27:17.470
rod in my leg.

27:17.511 --> 27:18.971
I'd be lucky to hop

27:17.511 --> 27:18.971
up on a beam again.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.014
Well I can help you. Pierce

27:19.012 --> 27:21.014
can help you.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.642
Please just come

27:22.682 --> 27:24.642
back to the gym tomorrow.

27:35.737 --> 27:39.657
- I'm busy with something else.

27:35.737 --> 27:39.657
- Yeah? What?

27:42.369 --> 27:43.661
I'll do it.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.791
Do what?

27:47.833 --> 27:51.086
Help out your crew. Teach you

27:47.833 --> 27:51.086
guys some flips

27:51.128 --> 27:53.506
and handsprings and stuff.

27:53.547 --> 27:58.218
Really? Wow. Sorry,

27:53.547 --> 27:58.218
Ariana this is Caity.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.719
Hi. Ariana.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.679
Caity.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.432
Caity was a

28:01.721 --> 28:03.432
professional downhill skier.

28:03.474 --> 28:07.478
I got in a fight. With a

28:03.474 --> 28:07.478
tree. Been a regular patron of

28:07.520 --> 28:10.730
room 404 ever since.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.732
How long is your

28:10.772 --> 28:12.732
recovery schedule?

28:12.774 --> 28:17.237
Only another, what, 60 maybe

28:12.774 --> 28:17.237
70 years. If I'm lucky.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.989
Does that sound about right?

28:19.031 --> 28:22.784
Caity has come a long

28:19.031 --> 28:22.784
way. A very long way.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.411
I'm sorry.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.873
No, don't be. You should see

28:24.453 --> 28:27.873
the tree. No, I'm not a patient

28:27.914 --> 28:32.378
anymore - I just come to spend

28:27.914 --> 28:32.378
time with others here who are in

28:27.914 --> 28:32.378
similar situations.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.754
Caity heads a support group

28:32.419 --> 28:34.754
for families with spinal cord

28:34.796 --> 28:35.922
injury patients.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.757
If there is

28:35.964 --> 28:37.757
anything I can do to help-

28:37.799 --> 28:42.513
You just stay focused on

28:37.799 --> 28:42.513
yourself. You've got your own

28:37.799 --> 28:42.513
hill to climb.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.142
- Thanks.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.142
- I'll see you next

28:43.972 --> 28:47.142
week, okay? Take care. Bye.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.229
So? You had fun last night?

28:50.270 --> 28:53.273
Yes. Thank you for taking me.

29:07.829 --> 29:12.751
I dunno, it's taking a while.

29:07.829 --> 29:12.751
They're late probably,

29:07.829 --> 29:12.751
right? I don't know.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.755
Hey. I got us some help.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.508
Welcome back.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.760
Hold up. Hold up. What do

29:19.550 --> 29:21.760
we need peg-leg's help for?

29:21.801 --> 29:25.222
"Peg-leg?" She ain't no dang

29:21.801 --> 29:25.222
pirate! What's wrong with you?

29:25.264 --> 29:28.267
I just don't need no gymnast

29:25.264 --> 29:28.267
telling me how to dance.

29:29.851 --> 29:33.689
There's a small chance

29:29.851 --> 29:33.689
the speaker may be broken.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.857
That's Twist

29:33.731 --> 29:35.857
running up my overhead.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.119
And you remember Adam

29:45.117 --> 29:47.119
from the other night?

29:55.586 --> 29:57.337
And of course, Emma.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.381
The "Empress" at

29:57.379 --> 29:59.381
your acquaintance.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.267
And this fountain of

30:08.265 --> 30:10.267
positivity here is Cashmere.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.738
Eighty percent attitude

30:18.900 --> 30:22.738
and twenty percent high heels.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.531
So, what are you going to

30:22.780 --> 30:24.531
teach us that

30:24.573 --> 30:25.865
we don't already know?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.867
She's going to teach us moves

30:25.907 --> 30:27.867
that we can use in our routine

30:27.909 --> 30:29.869
so that we can get a

30:27.909 --> 30:29.869
contract with C.I.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.498
With some leverage training

30:29.911 --> 30:32.498
and a little less burrito I

30:32.539 --> 30:35.083
could help you get seven

30:32.539 --> 30:35.083
or eight feet of air.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.669
Seven or eight feet of air?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.044
Mhm.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.838
Okay.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.048
So, you're gonna

30:39.879 --> 30:42.048
teach us leverage?

30:42.090 --> 30:46.637
Sounds good to me. I'm always

30:42.090 --> 30:46.637
down to learn something new.

30:46.679 --> 30:47.846
I'll bet you are.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.017
So you going to

30:49.931 --> 30:52.017
take those off?

30:52.058 --> 30:54.520
There's two things you need

30:52.058 --> 30:54.520
to know, honey.

30:54.561 --> 30:59.608
One. I take off my heels when

30:54.561 --> 30:59.608
I'm good and ready.

30:54.561 --> 30:59.608
Two...

vaults.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.502
Once a gymnast,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.502
always a gymnast.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.048
So, where'd you

33:26.087 --> 33:29.048
learn to dance?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.050
I learned to

33:29.090 --> 33:31.050
dance on the streets.

33:31.092 --> 33:36.014
Oh, the

33:31.092 --> 33:36.014
streets. Wow. Hard-core.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.893
Mostly my backyard

33:36.890 --> 33:39.893
or in the schoolyard.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.022
So how'd you guys

33:41.520 --> 33:44.022
all get together?

33:44.063 --> 33:47.651
Well we all went to the

33:44.063 --> 33:47.651
same elementary school.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.737
But this whole C.I thing, this

33:47.693 --> 33:50.737
is recent.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.032
Michelle's just been laser

33:50.779 --> 33:54.032
focused, she wants to go

33:50.779 --> 33:54.032
bigtime.

33:54.658 --> 33:58.704
You guys totally could.

33:54.658 --> 33:58.704
You're honestly amazing.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.583
So, do you have a

34:00.580 --> 34:03.583
boyfriend?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.461
Smooth

34:06.503 --> 34:09.422
I mean, I was just wondering

34:06.503 --> 34:09.422
'cause I think Twist

34:09.464 --> 34:11.757
thinks you're really cute.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.971
Oh. He's kinda cute.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.016
Okay I think it's time to

34:16.763 --> 34:19.016
take you home because you're

34:19.056 --> 34:22.518
mentally exhausted or

34:19.056 --> 34:22.518
somethin'. Let's go.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.522
What? What are you doing?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.666
So tell me more

34:42.539 --> 34:44.666
about these auditions.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.167
Ever seen "Dance

34:44.708 --> 34:46.167
for the Moment?"

34:46.208 --> 34:47.920
Both the movie and

34:46.208 --> 34:47.920
the Broadway show.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.464
Well those are Crystal Image

34:47.960 --> 34:51.464
dancers. Look,

34:51.505 --> 34:54.384
if you want to make it as a

34:51.505 --> 34:54.384
dancer, you have to go pro.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.844
And making this audit ion is

34:54.426 --> 34:56.844
the best way to do that.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.139
And what about the clinic?

35:00.181 --> 35:03.101
I love it here. But, dance is

35:00.181 --> 35:03.101
my passion

35:03.602 --> 35:07.773
and I'd say passion's

35:03.602 --> 35:07.773
worth a shot, no?

35:07.814 --> 35:09.816
Well you guys need to

35:07.814 --> 35:09.816
gain confidence for acrobatic

35:09.858 --> 35:13.152
stability and that's after many

35:09.858 --> 35:13.152
hours on the floor and that's

35:13.194 --> 35:15.739
before we even start

35:13.194 --> 35:15.739
with the trampolines.

35:15.781 --> 35:20.159
Trampolines? I'm sorry, what

35:15.781 --> 35:20.159
kind of hours are we talking

35:15.781 --> 35:20.159
here?

35:20.201 --> 35:22.370
Well, for expert-hood they

35:20.201 --> 35:22.370
say ten thousand, but since we

35:22.412 --> 35:26.165
don't have that kind of

35:22.412 --> 35:26.165
time... all of them?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.584
Are you crazy?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.002
You just realized that?

35:29.044 --> 35:31.129
Michelle Franklin room

35:29.044 --> 35:31.129
316, Michelle Franklin 316

35:31.170 --> 35:34.257
Look, I gotta run. But,

35:31.170 --> 35:34.257
we'll talk about this later.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.635
Practice starts tonight.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.973
Remember, ten sits and

35:38.011 --> 35:40.973
stands three times a day.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.231
Hey! Look who's ready

35:46.937 --> 35:50.231
to conquer the world.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.651
I'm feeling pretty good.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.651
Michelle's a great motivator.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.193
That she is.

35:54.235 --> 35:58.657
Well, it's my last day here

35:54.235 --> 35:58.657
today and I just

35:58.698 --> 36:02.452
- wanted to say that -

35:58.698 --> 36:02.452
- This is one place where

35:58.698 --> 36:02.452
goodbyes are a good thing.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.204
It's great when people can

36:02.494 --> 36:05.204
leave, especially on their own

36:02.494 --> 36:05.204
two

36:05.246 --> 36:06.790
feet.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.209
There should be gold medals

36:06.832 --> 36:10.209
awarded to inspirational people

36:06.832 --> 36:10.209
like you.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.170
What's a medal anyway?

36:25.976 --> 36:30.605
Nice Vicki. Work your

36:25.976 --> 36:30.605
snap down. Keep your

36:25.976 --> 36:30.605
weight behind you.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.858
Pierce, I need a favour.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.233
Okay?

36:34.275 --> 36:36.235
Can my dance troupe practice

36:34.275 --> 36:36.235
in here during your off hours?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Since when

36:36.277 --> 36:38.488
do you have a dance troupe?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.533
It's a hip hop group. I'm

36:38.530 --> 36:41.533
just teaching

36:38.530 --> 36:41.533
them some flips and stuff.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.704
Okay.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.329
What?

36:46.454 --> 36:49.415
Nothing. It's just..

36:49.457 --> 36:50.876
Spit it out.

36:52.293 --> 36:56.506
If you're doing hip hop, why

36:52.293 --> 36:56.506
aren't you doing gymnastics?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.633
And where am I going

36:56.548 --> 36:58.633
to do gymnastics, Pierce?

36:58.675 --> 37:01.636
Same place as Isla. UCLA.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.268
You know, I can

37:06.307 --> 37:09.268
get you a demo in front of Coach

37:06.307 --> 37:09.268
Val in a couple of weeks.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.021
You really oughta

37:09.310 --> 37:11.021
think about it.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.066
So what about

37:11.063 --> 37:14.066
letting us practice in here?

37:17.819 --> 37:20.739
Well done, Vicki!

37:17.819 --> 37:20.739
Let's see that again.

37:30.707 --> 37:31.290
Wow

37:32.792 --> 37:35.212
Okay, so last time we did

37:32.792 --> 37:35.212
this everyone had to hold back.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.214
Now we can all let loose and

37:35.253 --> 37:37.214
not worry about

37:37.255 --> 37:41.718
anyone breaking their

37:37.255 --> 37:41.718
necks. Okay, so what do

37:37.255 --> 37:41.718
you guys want to do?

37:44.345 --> 37:46.014
You know what I want to do.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.807

42:48.983 --> 42:51.652
it's manageable.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.613
Look, I know I mentioned this

42:52.445 --> 42:54.613
to you a couple of weeks ago,

42:54.655 --> 42:57.200
but UCLA is having

42:54.655 --> 42:57.200
some walk-on demos soon.

42:57.783 --> 42:59.452
I don't know.

42:59.494 --> 43:03.873

42:59.494 --> 43:03.873
know, you have your dance thing,

43:03.915 --> 43:06.625
but come on do you really

43:03.915 --> 43:06.625
want to leave your

43:06.667 --> 43:11.589
entire past behind? This is

43:06.667 --> 43:11.589
the date and time.

43:19.638 --> 43:24.060
Five, six, seven, eight. One,

43:19.638 --> 43:24.060
two, three, four, five,

43:24.102 --> 43:26.104
and six, seven, eight.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.858
Aight, everyone take

43:27.313 --> 43:30.858
five. This isn't working.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.694
Ok, the problem is we're too

43:30.900 --> 43:33.694
coordinated. We need

43:33.736 --> 43:36.322
to loosen up. Instead of

43:33.736 --> 43:36.322
getting together at this

43:33.736 --> 43:36.322
point,

43:36.364 --> 43:39.658
let's break off in a freestyle

43:36.364 --> 43:39.658
section. Play to each of

43:36.364 --> 43:39.658
your strengths.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.036
Twist, you've come

43:39.700 --> 43:42.036
further than anyone else

43:39.700 --> 43:42.036
with the height, you're

43:42.078 --> 43:45.290
going to do a chest lift off of

43:42.078 --> 43:45.290
Adam since he has the strength.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.375
And then Cashmere, aerials

43:45.331 --> 43:47.375
moving forward,

43:47.417 --> 43:48.834
Michelle you're going to run

43:47.417 --> 43:48.834
through it all.

43:48.876 --> 43:53.298
Yeah, but we still need

43:48.876 --> 43:53.298
something bigger to close it.

43:53.339 --> 43:54.799
An aerial section?

43:54.840 --> 43:58.553
No, that would be good enough

43:54.840 --> 43:58.553
for the Palace, but not for C.I.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.597
We need something bigger.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.975
What's the holy grail

44:00.638 --> 44:03.975
of gymnastics, Ariana?

44:04.016 --> 44:07.520
The full out. Two flips with

44:04.016 --> 44:07.520
a full twist.

44:08.729 --> 44:12.691
Thought impossible until the

44:08.729 --> 44:12.691
invention of spring floors.

44:08.729 --> 44:12.691
Even elite gymnasts

44:12.733 --> 44:15.194
have a hard time with it. I

44:12.733 --> 44:15.194
tried landing one in practice a

44:12.733 --> 44:15.194
few

44:15.236 --> 44:20.741
weeks before my accident. Never

44:15.236 --> 44:20.741
had the chance to try it in

44:15.236 --> 44:20.741
competition.

44:20.783 --> 44:24.370
You could totally do one now.

44:20.783 --> 44:24.370
I mean you are

44:20.783 --> 44:24.370
stronger than ever.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.205
Please. Do you know

44:24.412 --> 44:26.205
how tough it would be

44:26.247 --> 44:27.999
with a rod in my femur?

44:28.040 --> 44:32.962
Yeah! Full out, full out,

44:28.040 --> 44:32.962
full out, full out, full out,

44:33.754 --> 44:37.091
full out, full out,

44:33.754 --> 44:37.091
full out, full out-

44:37.133 --> 44:39.802
Yeah, come on. Do a full out!

44:39.844 --> 44:42.221
Yo, if you're gonna gawk,

44:39.844 --> 44:42.221
you gotta pay admission!

44:42.263 --> 44:46.392
Hey, what are you guys doing

44:42.263 --> 44:46.392
here? Isn't it a little late?

44:46.434 --> 44:49.145
Pierce told us that

44:46.434 --> 44:49.145
you skipped out on UCLA.

44:49.187 --> 44:50.687
I'm good.

44:50.729 --> 44:52.731
I didn't think you were

44:50.729 --> 44:52.731
serious about the hip hop thing.

44:52.773 --> 44:55.734
I figured it was a

44:52.773 --> 44:55.734
cover story or something.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.778
Well, here it is.

44:57.820 --> 45:00.865
Who's the

44:57.820 --> 45:00.865
Swedish bikini model?

45:00.906 --> 45:03.409
Isla's one of the top

45:00.906 --> 45:03.409
gymnasts in the world.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.453
She just won a Silver medal.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.746
Ariana, this is ridiculous.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.746
Are you really gonna throw away

45:07.788 --> 45:11.750
a chance at college gymnastics

45:07.788 --> 45:11.750
to hangout in alleys making up

45:11.792 --> 45:14.671
dances with low-lifes?

45:14.711 --> 45:17.590
We're five of the top ten

45:14.711 --> 45:17.590
ranked artists in the city.

45:17.632 --> 45:20.343
Sorry, I guess I wouldn't

45:17.632 --> 45:20.343
know about artists.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.844
See, I'm what they

45:20.385 --> 45:21.844
call an athlete.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.762
Well, that's good.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.762
Considering that you're

45:23.804 --> 45:26.849
definitely not a stylist.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.227
Stop taking advantage of

45:26.891 --> 45:29.227
Ariana's fragile state, and let

45:29.268 --> 45:30.769
her come back to

45:29.268 --> 45:30.769
where she belongs.

45:30.811 --> 45:35.358
She belongs wherever she

45:30.811 --> 45:35.358
wants. She's here. So

45:35.400 --> 45:37.734
why don't you just do a

45:35.400 --> 45:37.734
little flip outta here.

Yeah.

What can I do to help you?

49:13.868 --> 49:17.830

49:13.868 --> 49:17.830
have to do to become

49:17.872 --> 49:20.625

You want to

49:20.666 --> 49:23.001

49:23.043 --> 49:24.629
Yeah.

that's not enough.

49:35.097 --> 49:38.893

49:38.935 --> 49:40.937

But can you give me one

Absolutely. A hundred

percent. A hundred

50:01.081 --> 50:03.417
and ten percent.

I'll need to

No.

52:37.947 --> 52:39.865
I never said I

52:37.947 --> 52:39.865
was mad at you.

52:39.907 --> 52:44.495
Not in so many words. Mainly

52:39.907 --> 52:44.495
'cause you don't say anything to

52:39.907 --> 52:44.495
me anymore.

52:51.002 --> 52:53.004
Why do you keep

52:59.927 --> 53:01.219
accident.

53:01.261 --> 53:04.348
What was I supposed to do, stop

53:01.261 --> 53:04.348
living my life?

53:04.389 --> 53:06.224
I don't want

53:04.389 --> 53:06.224
to talk about it.

53:06.266 --> 53:12.188
Look, I wish you were at

53:06.266 --> 53:12.188
the games too. But it is not my

53:06.266 --> 53:12.188
fault.

54:08.286 --> 54:12.416
She's hit a plateau. It's one

54:08.286 --> 54:12.416
amateur mistake after another.

54:12.457 --> 54:16.420
Can you talk to her?

54:12.457 --> 54:16.420
Help her find her focus.

54:16.461 --> 54:18.254
Why me?

54:18.296 --> 54:22.634
Because she'll listen to you.

54:18.296 --> 54:22.634
I think it coming from me it's

54:18.296 --> 54:22.634
more pressure.

54:22.676 --> 54:27.639
Well Miss Val, Isla and

54:22.676 --> 54:27.639
I don't really talk much.

54:29.725 --> 54:33.353
I thought you

54:29.725 --> 54:33.353
two were friends?

54:33.395 --> 54:35.981
We kinda fell out.

54:36.023 --> 54:38.567
Well fall back in, Ariana.

54:36.023 --> 54:38.567
This is a gymnastics team and

54:38.609 --> 54:40.611
your teammate needs your help.

54:45.532 --> 54:49.828
Isla! Wait! Where are you going?

54:45.532 --> 54:49.828
Just to the bus stop. My dad

54:49.870 --> 54:52.623
left without me so...

54:52.664 --> 54:54.041
Why?

54:54.083 --> 54:58.294
He said he can't even

54:54.083 --> 54:58.294
look at me right now.

54:58.336 --> 55:00.631
Do you want to

54:58.336 --> 55:00.631
talk about it?

55:00.672 --> 55:03.675
Val set you up for this, didn't

55:00.672 --> 55:03.675
she?

55:05.594 --> 55:07.345
I bet you didn't want to.

55:07.387 --> 55:11.267
Isla, it was always my dream

55:07.387 --> 55:11.267
to go to the Olympics

55:11.307 --> 55:14.352
and win a medal and then

55:11.307 --> 55:14.352
go to UCLA and have

55:14.394 --> 55:19.357
lots of fun. But that didn't

55:14.394 --> 55:19.357
happen, instead you got it

55:14.394 --> 55:19.357
all.

55:20.400 --> 55:25.156
And I guess it's just hard for

55:20.400 --> 55:25.156
me to watch from the sidelines.

55:25.197 --> 55:26.364
Really?

55:26.406 --> 55:28.366
Yeah, really.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.829
I thought you were mad at me.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.829
Well I guess I was a bit mad

55:31.870 --> 55:34.539
about the whole Nate

55:31.870 --> 55:34.539
thing, but I'm over it.

55:34.581 --> 55:37.375
I'm so sorry about that. I

55:34.581 --> 55:37.375
should have told you the truth

55:37.417 --> 55:40.378
but it's over and

55:37.417 --> 55:40.378
it didn't work out.

55:40.420 --> 55:43.381
It's okay. And I'll

55:40.420 --> 55:43.381
still

55:43.423 --> 55:46.384
always know that you peed

55:43.423 --> 55:46.384
yourself on that bus.

55:46.426 --> 55:52.348
Well, just so you know, the

55:46.426 --> 55:52.348
Olympics weren't all that great.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.685
- Don't believe the hype.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.685
- Are you serious?

55:54.726 --> 55:56.770
No! They were amazing and you

55:56.812 --> 55:59.731
needed to be there. It was

55:56.812 --> 55:59.731
so awful that you weren't. I

55:56.812 --> 55:59.731
missed you the whole time.

55:59.773 --> 56:03.401
I bet you did? Especially

55:59.773 --> 56:03.401
when you blew that dismount.

56:03.443 --> 56:05.946
Well at least I was there

56:03.443 --> 56:05.946
and not slacking off in some

56:05.988 --> 56:07.405
hospital room.

56:07.447 --> 56:10.034
Well at least I

56:07.447 --> 56:10.034
got free pudding!

56:10.075 --> 56:13.411
Well, you're getting your

56:10.075 --> 56:13.411
revenge now.

56:13.453 --> 56:17.124
I peaked and it's been

56:13.453 --> 56:17.124
downhill ever since.

56:17.166 --> 56:18.709
You can break out of it.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.502
Oh I would love to just

56:20.544 --> 56:23.547
forget about gymnastics for

56:20.544 --> 56:23.547
a little while.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.382
What?

56:32.472 --> 56:34.099
Six, Seven, Eight!

56:37.561 --> 56:41.148
Hey. I haven't seen or heard

56:37.561 --> 56:41.148
from you in weeks.

56:41.190 --> 56:42.816
I was about to bust

56:41.190 --> 56:42.816
down your door.

56:42.858 --> 56:44.442
I was sick.

56:44.484 --> 56:46.904
There's no time to be sick.

56:44.484 --> 56:46.904
Auditions are twelve days away.

56:46.945 --> 56:51.533
Check what we've got it on.

56:51.575 --> 56:55.162
They don't know you're back

56:51.575 --> 56:55.162
on the gymnastics team, do they?

56:55.204 --> 56:58.207
I just haven't

56:55.204 --> 56:58.207
figured out how to tell them.

56:59.208 --> 57:02.794
Or have you not

56:59.208 --> 57:02.794
figured out what you want?

57:02.836 --> 57:05.505
I miss hating you

57:02.836 --> 57:05.505
for knowing me so well.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.468
Hi.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.054
Chill cheese fries?

57:12.096 --> 57:13.847
No, no. I can't.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.473
Sure you can.

57:15.515 --> 57:19.353
No seriously. My

57:15.515 --> 57:19.353
coach will kill me.

57:20.562 --> 57:23.690
I, I don't see any

57:20.562 --> 57:23.690
coaches around here.

57:28.195 --> 57:30.822
Okay but, just,

57:28.195 --> 57:30.822
just a little bit.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.490
Okay just a little bit-

57:32.532 --> 57:34.034
Just a small-

57:34.076 --> 57:38.663
Just a small- That's pretty

57:34.076 --> 57:38.663
big but yeah go for it.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.375
It's good, just, just

57:38.705 --> 57:41.375
try it. Just try it.

57:41.417 --> 57:42.418
Okay.

57:47.547 --> 57:48.715
Oh that's good.

57:48.757 --> 57:53.137
See, this is what I do. I

57:48.757 --> 57:53.137
bring joy to the people.

57:53.178 --> 57:56.514
Want another one?

57:56.556 --> 57:57.515
Just one more.

57:57.557 --> 57:58.516
Okay.

57:58.558 --> 57:59.726
Just one.

57:59.768 --> 58:01.686
I'm going to take one too.

58:01.728 --> 58:02.729
Okay

58:04.731 --> 58:07.525
Oh my god

58:07.567 --> 58:09.486
Oh okay. Alright.

training time.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.613
You have got to give this up.

59:35.655 --> 59:38.992
I know you're upset, but

59:35.655 --> 59:38.992
that's what got me back into

gymnastics.

59:39.034 --> 59:41.619
It got you moving again, it

59:39.034 --> 59:41.619
got you motivated.

and you're burning out.

59:44.122 --> 59:46.624
I don't know if you noticed,

59:44.122 --> 59:46.624
but Isla spent one night around

59:46.666 --> 59:48.502
that stuff and

59:46.666 --> 59:48.502
she's back on track.

59:48.544 --> 59:50.337
Ariana you've got to start

59:48.544 --> 59:50.337
thinking about what's important

59:50.379 --> 59:54.174
to you. And start making the

59:50.379 --> 59:54.174
right choices. You've gotta feel

59:54.216 --> 59:57.677
it in here. This is where it

59:54.216 --> 59:57.677
matters the most.

59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.639
So what's it gonna be? What

59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.639
family are you gonna

59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.639
choose? Are you gonna

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.183
one that will put

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.183
you on the road to

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.644
becoming a champion? Or

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.644
are you gonna choose the one

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.857
that could lead you to

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.857
being a back up dancer

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.857
in some rap video?

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.443
It's not fair.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.237
You focus on one or you

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.237
fail at both. It's that simple.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:56.694
Hey.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:57.654
Hey.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.700
What's up?

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:07.705
Nothing. Just starting to

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:07.705
realize my limitations I guess.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.921
I don't think you know the

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.921
meaning of limitations.

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:17.966
They literally could not

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:17.966
stop you unless they hit

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:17.966
you with a car.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.471
Thanks.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.147
I think you're

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.147
really cool, Ariana.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.608
You're pretty cool yourself.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.327
Let's go warm up.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.996
So I heard you really brought it

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.996
at the dance jam the other day.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.040
Well I'm paying for it today.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.294
Is there anything I can do to

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.294
take your mind off of it?

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:57.339
You just keep massaging, Mr.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.094
That's what I'm good at.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:13.438
I can't do this. There's

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:13.438
something I need to tell you.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.778
Hey it's the dancing queen.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.778
Did you see the video

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.778
We posted last night?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.577
Yeah, I did. And

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.577
so did my coach.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:29.454
Coach? What coach?

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.082
I need to tell you guys

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.082
something.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.089
I can't dance with you

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.089
anymore. My coach wants me to

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.089
focus entirely on gymnastics.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.216
What?

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.468
- Why didn't you say something?

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.468
- I didn't know how to.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.844
Look, it's not an easy

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.844
decision,

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:49.307
but I've been doing gymnastics

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:49.307
my entire life. They're

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:49.307
like my family.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:50.808
And what are we?

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.812
Cashmere, you know it's not

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.812
like that. I can't do both.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:03:00.611
Really? After everything

01:02:54.854 --> 01:03:00.611
we've been through? This is it.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.862
I'm really sorry.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:07.909
Let's go.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.787
Where are you guys going?

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.787
We can still practice.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:13.831
Adam?

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.300
See you later, Ariana.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.399
It's alright Soph.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:43.861
Are you kidding me? Where is

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:43.861
your head?

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.657

audience to give you your

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.867
performance and your energy.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.867
Why are waiting for that? It's

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:54.038

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:18.850

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:18.850
