01:29.339 --> 01:31.633
I'm so glad those fit you.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.886
You look adorable. Look at yourself.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.640
I feel like everyone can see my body.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.185
Well, who cares if they can see it?

01:42.519 --> 01:44.897
I mean, this is what normal girls wear.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.649
You can wear this all day, you know?

01:47.733 --> 01:50.527
To the park or to the store.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.904
It's not safe to go out.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.823
You'll get there.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.283
And there's no rush.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.493
But how about we get you some exercise?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.162
You ready for our lesson?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.878
I can't believe
you found all these old records.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.588
I haven't seen them in ages.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.719
You know, I saw Vivian Dale live once

02:15.802 --> 02:18.472
at a little club in New York
on the Lower East Side.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.933
She died so young.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.602
Drugs, I think.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.480
Maybe a boyfriend who abused her.

02:27.022 --> 02:31.109
I can't remember but, ugh, when she
was on stage, she was like a goddess.

02:31.610 --> 02:36.281
She was in so much pain,
but she turned that pain into power.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.410
That's good. Yes!

02:40.494 --> 02:41.662
But don't just extend the arm.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.540
You gotta send the energy
all the way through your fingertips.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.792
Yes, that's what you want to do
in every position.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.628
Look at you.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.756
I'm terrible at dancing.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.466
What?

02:55.509 --> 02:56.927
Why would you say that?

02:58.637 --> 03:00.222
It's what my mother used to say.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.643
Whenever I'd have to learn choreography
for a pageant,

03:05.143 --> 03:07.729
she wouldn't let me eat dinner
until I got it perfect.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.442
And, you know, I remember
trying really hard to do my best.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.404
But eventually,
I'd just be so tired and hungry

03:15.487 --> 03:18.115
that it was impossible to get it right.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.285
Sweetheart.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.871
Dorothy, I need you!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.664
What is it?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.583
The safety guy!

03:28.125 --> 03:29.543
Oh, shit.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.921
Oh, God, I've got
this meeting that I'm supposed to go to.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.006
Are you coming back?

03:34.089 --> 03:37.885
No, I'm sorry.
But we can pick up again tomorrow. Yeah?

03:53.817 --> 03:57.362
Right from where I'm sitting,
I see, like, 15 deadly hazards.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.156
Starting with this table.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.450
Put bumpers on that.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.952
And that armoire you got over there.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.537
Sharp corners?

04:05.621 --> 04:07.831
Worse. Toddlers like to climb.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.417
Every two weeks,
a kid dies from furniture tipping over.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.502
Oh, my God.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.338
Hey. We'll anchor it to the wall.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.631
Okay.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.300
Now, outlets.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.845
A hundred kids a year
die from electrocution.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.680
Sad. Very sad.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.478
Well, we'll put safety gates on each floor
and Plexi along the sides here,

04:29.561 --> 04:32.022
'cause toddlers love to stick
their little heads through the spindles.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.610
Leanne, could you keep him occupied
until we're done here?

04:36.693 --> 04:37.694
Thanks.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.707
I know. We gotta move
all this cleaning stuff up higher.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.962
No need. We'll put locks on all
the cabinets and stove knobs too.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.214
Is that really necessary?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.967
I'm a professional chef, so I can't have
a bunch of gadgetry stopping me--

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
-Sean.
-You don't need this.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.055
As long as I'm here,
nothing will ever happen to Jericho.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.724
Leanne.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.603
He's hungry. You need to feed him.

05:14.690 --> 05:15.774
Excuse us.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.157
Babysitter really rules the roost, huh?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.501
…with a special report.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.628
Our cochairs
for tonight's event said this is…

05:36.712 --> 05:37.921
I really don't like that man.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.633
Leanne, he's not
one of your creepy cult people.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.011
He's owned the company for years.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.847
You're gonna have to trust
that I know what's best for my son.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.266
…long stay at a villa in Tuscany.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.476
I can't believe they had Isabelle
do "Spring at the Mansion."

05:51.560 --> 05:53.854
I've been doing this fucking party
for eight years.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.148
Well, I'm glad they didn't ask you.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.442
-We need you here at home.
-…is "spring has sprung."

05:58.525 --> 06:00.736
-And we are definitely…
-This is so hurtful.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.196
It's like I'm invisible.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.740
The dance floor is full,
the bar is open and…

06:04.823 --> 06:07.159
God, I don't even know
if he's getting anything.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.204
My supply's dropping
ever since he's been on solids.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.664
Maybe I should put him back on formula
if we want him to gain weight.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.791
No. No. Your milk is better.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.710
You're just not sticking to his schedule.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.588
And you're not drinking enough water.
Would you drink this, please?

06:19.671 --> 06:21.673
-…that if you have a man in your life…
-Drink it.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.051
-…who hasn't been screened…
-It's fine. Leave it.

06:24.134 --> 06:28.305
…particularly if he's over the age of 55,
now is the time to do it.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.433
No more making excuses
and putting it off for later.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.685
I know how much
men hate going to the doctor,

06:33.769 --> 06:36.688
but this really could be
a matter between life and death.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.234
Walter,
don't tell my trainer about this, okay?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.283
There you are.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.121
Good for you. A little fresh air.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.252
Still friends?

07:08.345 --> 07:09.346
Where are you going?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.015
I asked for a meeting at the station.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.852
Sometimes you just have to go in there
and ask for what you need.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.020
Sean has Jericho. Wish me luck.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.318
Stay away from me.

07:23.402 --> 07:24.736
I just want to talk to you.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.424
-Hey.
-Morning, Chef.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.759
Want you to meet someone.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.344
-Sylvia. Hi.
-Hi.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.472
I had this sweet gig as a private chef
on this guy's yacht for a while,

07:52.556 --> 07:53.974
but then he got busted by the Feds,

07:54.057 --> 07:56.810
so now I'm back in town just trying
to pay off my student loans, you know?

07:57.603 --> 07:58.645
Yeah, I hear that.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.565
Hey, Leanne,
come meet my girlfriend, Sylvia.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.151
Leanne takes care of Jericho.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.403
So cute.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.114
What is he, like, 18 months?

08:09.198 --> 08:11.241
Nine months. He's big for his age.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.326
He's perfect.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.999
So anyway, we were thinking
if you ever need an extra pair of hands

08:19.082 --> 08:21.627
for a big job or something,
Sylvia could totally help out.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.379
I have references. I mean,
not from the yacht guy. He's in prison.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.132
But I spent a year at Jean-Georges,
so I can make anything.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.594
Yeah, that's great. Sure.
I don't usually--

08:30.677 --> 08:33.263
Sometimes people don't realize how
much help they need until it's too late.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.269
I need to get back to work.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.940
Sure thing. And if you want, I'll work
the first shift for free. Trial basis.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.400
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.611
Thank you, Chef. I'll see you tomorrow.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.821
-Sure.
-Super good to meet you.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.573
I loved you on Gourmet Gauntlet.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.369
What the fuck was that?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.580
I understand the desperation
for a new gig, but come on.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.916
Tobe knows better
than try and foist some cook on me.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.043
What are you guys doing tomorrow?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.461
Pain-in-the-ass catering job.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.339
Actually, I could put you to work,
if you want to pitch in.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.715
Yeah, I'd love to.

09:09.424 --> 09:13.470
Cool. Yeah, Dorothy could hang
with Jericho. You ever made candy?

09:14.346 --> 09:15.597
No.

09:15.681 --> 09:18.851
We're doing saltwater taffy
with passion fruit and fleur de sel.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.937
You just throw it over the hook,
over and over,

09:22.437 --> 09:24.314
to aerate it until it turns white.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.399
It's fun.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.443
And it would put some muscles
on those puny little arms.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.654
Hey. I'm stronger than I look.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.116
Yeah, I bet you are,
from carrying this little bruiser around.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.954
After you put him down for his nap,
come back. We'll talk over the menu.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.038
Yes, Chef.

09:40.873 --> 09:45.252
I just got the babyproofing estimate:
$3,000 for 99-cents pieces of shit that--

09:45.335 --> 09:49.631
Thank you. Yes. Me too.
I am really looking forward.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.469
I'm back! I am back in the game.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.222
In-depth report
on the street murals downtown.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.516
I don't know,
maybe they're just doing it to shut me up.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.936
But who cares? At least they're giving me
a chance to prove I'm still worth it.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.771
You are still worth it.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.023
Fuck!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.900
This is the kind of piece
that could go national.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.776
-When does it start?
-Tomorrow.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.196
And if all goes well,
I'm gonna be out all week.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.157
Tomorrow, I need Leanne in the kitchen.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.911
Don't you have Tobe?

10:18.994 --> 10:21.496
Yeah, but it's a ton of prep,
so I need her.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.665
Can't we get someone else
to look after Jericho?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.544
Do you expect me to just snap my fingers

10:27.628 --> 10:30.047
and find someone else
who can watch our child?

10:30.923 --> 10:33.550
No, it's just that Leanne
was really looking forward to it.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.053
Sean, she can cook with you anytime.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.057
I just need this one week
to focus on myself and my work.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.476
Can you give me that?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.795
I'm so sorry.
I can't do our little class today.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.338
Why are you dressed for work?

11:12.005 --> 11:15.634
Well, I'm finally being shown the respect
I deserve again,

11:15.717 --> 11:17.261
and I've been given a big assignment.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.013
So, crazy hours this week.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.433
Sean has found someone else
to help in the kitchen

11:23.517 --> 11:25.435
so you can focus on Jericho.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.981
Did I get these buttons right?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.614
What time will you be home?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.576
Late.

11:41.243 --> 11:44.538
It's live, but there's a party
where we have to get some B-roll.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.793
It's not good for Jericho
when you're out late.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.714
Leanne, I understand
it makes you nervous when I'm not home.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.176
Just a few more buttons.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.266
I know you didn't grow up
around women who worked,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.728
but that's just not normal
for most people.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.272
I love my job.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.858
It makes me happy.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.402
It makes me a better mother.

12:15.485 --> 12:19.823
And if, God forbid, anything ever happened
to Sean, I can support this household.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.410
I would never let anything happen to Sean.

12:27.998 --> 12:28.999
Thank you.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.545
And thank you for helping me
hold down the fort this week.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.632
I want you to know
when you're watching me on television

12:38.425 --> 12:41.220
that I absolutely
could not do this without you.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.389
Plus,
we should be thinking about your future.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.518
You know,
you could get your high school degree.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.395
You could do that all online
without ever leaving the house.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.857
We want to help
you focus on your own goals,

12:53.941 --> 12:56.610
so you can become the woman
that you were meant to be.

12:57.528 --> 12:59.488
All I care about is this family.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.086
Hey, little buddy. Want a green bean?

13:14.169 --> 13:16.171
No, dumbass. He could choke on it.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.840
He can play with it. It's fine.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.760
Did you check on the tart shells
in the oven?

13:21.844 --> 13:23.178
Yeah. Five minutes.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.557
Do you maybe want to take that ring off?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.976
They said at the store
the acid could etch the stone.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.353
Yeah, I would, if I could
get the fucking thing to come off.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.438
The jeweler is gonna have to cut it off.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.400
I didn't realize it was too small.
I told him size six.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.151
Only my left hand is a size six.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.320
Well, I thought you'd wear it
on your left hand.

13:40.404 --> 13:43.031
Honey,
it's gotta be diamonds for this finger.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.908
-Right.
-What are you doing?

13:44.992 --> 13:47.703
Sean said brunoise,
not fucking matchsticks. Here.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.206
-Hey, Tobe. Why don't you take a break?
-Yeah.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.125
-Take these out to the kids in the park.
-Okay.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.591
Why are you so rude to Tobe?

14:01.592 --> 14:02.634
Excuse me?

14:02.718 --> 14:04.136
Where are the radicchio cups?

14:07.264 --> 14:09.141
Nice, Chef. Good work.

14:13.478 --> 14:17.524
Hey, so, Sean, you ever think
about starting your own restaurant?

14:18.066 --> 14:22.446
I mean, sure. I thought about it.
But I don't think it's gonna happen.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.823
I'm just saying. I know some investors.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.951
You are exactly the kind of chef
they're looking for.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.455
Young, hip, one-of-a-kind vision.
A superstar.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.957
Well, right now I'm just trying
to get through today.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.043
All right. Well,
when you get your Michelin star,

14:36.126 --> 14:37.544
you better keep me in mind.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.089
Hey, Chef, I couldn't find them.
Maybe they moved on?

14:41.173 --> 14:44.176
Are you insane? You think homeless kids
walk away from food like this?

14:47.012 --> 14:49.306
Shit. That's the safety guy.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.184
Leanne, could you answer the door
and make sure he gets anything he needs?

14:58.315 --> 15:01.735
Here. If you need anything else,
I'll just be in the kitchen.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.321
Actually, it'd be great
if you could stick around for a while.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.407
It's a pretty sweet house.
I wouldn't wanna mess anything up.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.413
How long you been working here?

15:13.497 --> 15:14.623
A few months.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.416
They treat you all right?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.710
Evenings off? Weekends?

15:19.211 --> 15:20.546
A lot of great clubs downtown.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.257
How old are you?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.801
I'm 18.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.056
You work out?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.476
You know, like, Zumba and stuff?

15:35.185 --> 15:37.855
I bet you are a great dancer.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.273
Come on, show me some moves.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.067
Hey, it's okay.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.027
You don't gotta be afraid of me.

15:48.824 --> 15:52.286
My buddy's got a place downtown.
Real upscale.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.663
If I brought you,
they would not check your ID.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.218
It's my fault, right?

16:08.302 --> 16:09.928
Because I look like a whore?

16:10.512 --> 16:11.805
Are you happy now?

16:12.347 --> 16:13.807
Are you happy?

16:25.527 --> 16:27.196
Get the fuck out of my way.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.744
Tobe, that candy is done.
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.245
Come help me with the garnishes.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.247
What?

16:39.249 --> 16:42.377
Stop! Stop! Jesus!
You're gonna ruin the ones I already did.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.963
Tobe! Take the trash out, please!

16:50.052 --> 16:52.012
How can you let her talk to you like that?

16:52.095 --> 16:53.388
All chefs talk that way.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.016
I've heard Sean yell at you
a hundred times. That's different.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.309
She's trying to hurt you.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.437
Sylvia's just a really insecure person.
Sometimes when insecure people just--

17:00.521 --> 17:02.606
She doesn't even like you, Tobe.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.567
All you want is to live a normal life,

17:05.651 --> 17:08.612
and everybody keeps thinking that
they can do whatever they want to you.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.074
Awful things to you. And that
you're always just gonna be there.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.575
And it's not fair.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.578
Leanne! Dorothy.

17:20.249 --> 17:21.290
Hello.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.462
Jericho's having sweet potato.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.551
I remember.

17:38.267 --> 17:42.646
I'm out here on Broad Street
with graffiti artist Diego Williams.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.316
Diego's street name is D. Wilz

17:46.400 --> 17:48.360
and our local Philly viewers

17:48.443 --> 17:51.405
may have seen his tag all over downtown.

17:51.488 --> 17:56.201
Diego, please tell us
about your inspiration for this piece.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.746
Ida B. Wells was a godmother
of the Civil Rights Movement.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.583
She was a journalist in the late 1800s.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.042
She forced everyone to see

18:04.626 --> 18:05.669
what was…

18:06.670 --> 18:08.213
happening in the…

18:09.381 --> 18:10.382
Miss?

18:10.966 --> 18:11.967
Are you all right?

18:14.595 --> 18:16.805
You can't leave him in here crying
when we're trying to work.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.393
Okay, okay. I'm here. You're okay.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.021
-Hey. I almost tripped.
-Excuse me.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.356
-Chef. Chef.
-Where do you want this?

18:26.440 --> 18:29.234
Goddamn it. I'm not ready.
Five minutes. Tobe, show 'em what's ready.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.780
This is the last room.
You want me to get started on the--

18:33.864 --> 18:35.365
No! Wait! Thirty minutes!

18:35.991 --> 18:37.534
If we wait,
I gotta pay my carpenter overtime.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.745
Then don't fucking do the kitchen!
I'll do it! Thank you.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.246
You're the boss.

18:41.914 --> 18:44.166
But you gotta sign this invoice
to confirm it's what you want.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.792
Leanne, could you sign that for me,
please?

18:56.512 --> 18:57.513
Easy, there.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.642
Watch it! Jesus!

19:01.725 --> 19:03.060
We'll see ourselves out.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.605
-My bad.
-Are you fucking--

19:06.688 --> 19:09.358
Listen to me. You have to handle that
like it's fucking plutonium.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.442
Where's the ceviche?

19:10.526 --> 19:12.069
Where's the ceviche?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.406
-I'm sorry. I…
-Oh, my God!

19:16.490 --> 19:18.909
You already gave them the ceviche?
You dumb fucking shit!

19:18.992 --> 19:20.452
I thought you were done with it.
I didn't--

19:20.536 --> 19:24.331
I have never met anyone so useless
in my entire life!

19:24.414 --> 19:25.999
I have been trying to prove myself to Sean

19:26.083 --> 19:29.753
and you have done nothing
except get in my way all fucking day!

19:29.837 --> 19:33.465
Do you have any idea how fucking
embarrassing you're making me look?

19:33.549 --> 19:35.717
Do you have any fucking idea
what you just did?

19:35.801 --> 19:38.011
You fucking moron! Fuck you!

19:38.095 --> 19:40.931
Nobody should ever fucking hire you ever--

19:42.266 --> 19:43.392
Shit.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.271
My ring got caught.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.574
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.368
What the fuck just happened?

20:01.451 --> 20:03.745
-She was…
-Apply pressure!

20:03.829 --> 20:05.247
Tobe! Where's her finger?

20:05.330 --> 20:07.040
-Where the fuck is her finger?
-What?

20:07.124 --> 20:08.917
-Find her finger.
-Finger, finger.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.795
Because the hospital needs it,
Tobe. In order to reattach it.

20:11.879 --> 20:15.174
-Yeah, I can't find it!
-Did you find it?

20:15.257 --> 20:17.009
-No! It's not anywhere!
-Tobe!

20:17.092 --> 20:18.302
-I don't see it anywhere!
-Tobe!

20:18.385 --> 20:20.053
-What? What?
-Tobe!

20:20.137 --> 20:21.555
-Tobe!
-What?

20:59.176 --> 21:01.094
Hey, you see Dorothy on TV?

21:02.930 --> 21:03.972
No.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.059
We had this huge fucking accident.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.477
You need to see this.

21:24.826 --> 21:25.869
Miss?

21:26.411 --> 21:27.746
Are you all right?

21:29.748 --> 21:33.418
Of course.
Can you tell us why you painted her?

21:33.502 --> 21:35.546
She was fearless.

21:35.629 --> 21:37.381
She single-handedly exposed the atrocities

21:37.464 --> 21:43.345
that were happening in the South
against African Americ…ans.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.640
Oh, my God!

21:50.477 --> 21:54.064
She's never gonna live this down.
She's done.

22:32.895 --> 22:36.231
I didn't give him the bottle yet,
in case you want to feed him.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.866
I'm glad you're home.

22:57.294 --> 22:58.754
When he was gone…

23:00.881 --> 23:02.007
I thought…

23:05.010 --> 23:07.429
if I can just have my baby back,

23:08.680 --> 23:11.725
I will never ask for anything else.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.610
But something's just not right.

23:26.281 --> 23:29.368
I can't explain it, but it's like…

23:32.663 --> 23:35.374
the universe is trying to hurt me or…

23:39.837 --> 23:40.838
like I've…

23:42.047 --> 23:43.423
lost something.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.467
Come here.

23:48.095 --> 23:49.930
Why can't this be enough?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.687
What is wrong with me, huh?
