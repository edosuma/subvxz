03:16.571 --> 03:17.607
All right, boys. Here we go.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.859
Nice and easy.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.654
Man, Mitch, if you weren't here...

03:22.744 --> 03:23.825
I'm always here.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.369
Don't worry, your friend's
gonna be all right.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.866
Are you Batman?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.870
Sure, pal. Just bigger and browner.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.327
- All right, boys, get him in.
- Have a good run, Mitch.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.753
All right, Steph.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.921
- Yeah, Mitch.
- Yo, Eros.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.000
How's it looking out there?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.051
Lippers are feebs today. Just eggy.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.255
<i>Waves are shitty today.</i>

03:43.348 --> 03:44.464
Eggy beyond. Nuggin' higher outside
than a full-on gazebo.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.845
<i>Yup. It's windy!</i>

03:47.018 --> 03:48.008
- Good call, brah.
- Come on.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.475
- All right, brah-brah!
- It's just brah.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.602
<i>Later!</i>

03:55.944 --> 03:57.185
- Come on, Pete.
- Hey, Mitch!

03:57.279 --> 03:58.861
I told you, you don't have to
do this every day.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.734
I want to. You saved my sister's life.

04:00.824 --> 04:01.940
You think I'm gonna forget that?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.525
All right. Well, listen,
tomorrow make my pecs a little bigger.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.609
And don't cover up my front bump.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.195
You got it. Huge dick.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.655
Big dick.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.247
- Yo, Ellerbee.
- Hey, Mitch.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.370
Hey, come on, man, why don't
you leave my boys alone,

04:12.461 --> 04:14.703
and get off this big wheel
and come join me for a run?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.003
What are you saying, that I need to work out?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.125
That I'm, what, looking smaller?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.204
No! You're looking big.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.836
I don't know how you
fit in that uniform, man.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.882
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey!

04:20.969 --> 04:22.551
If I had a sister,
I'd introduce you to her, man.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.594
You all right, all right.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.173
Wait, was that sarcastic?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.803
Like calling a tall guy "Shorty"?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.852
Damn it, he always does that to me.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.222
I heard he invented Google
and gave it all to charity.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.433
Man, I heard he invented
the cure for the common cold.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.564
He ain't Superman,
he's a damn county lifeguard.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.236
Grown man wears spandex to work.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.818
So does Superman.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.155
Hey, fuck you! Get off my beach!

04:49.372 --> 04:51.409
I don't even have to stretch to guard you.
Let's go.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.661
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.836
Not on my beach, Arian!

05:01.927 --> 05:03.259
- What up, Vern?
- What's up, Mitch?

05:03.345 --> 05:04.836
He saved my nana's life.
I ever tell you about that?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.421
Every time he jogs by.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.131
Literally, every single time.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.935
Hi, Mitch.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.625
Flakka. Jesus.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.255
Hey, what's up, buddy?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.757
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, can I see that?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.892
- Where'd you get this?
- Right there.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.186
Right there? Is this the only one?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.433
All right.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.821
You could go over there,
you could go the fuck over there,

06:04.906 --> 06:06.317
get the fuck out of here!

06:06.408 --> 06:07.899
What part of "private" do you not understand?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.905
Hey, hey. What's up, boys?

06:12.664 --> 06:15.372
- Beach belongs to everybody.
- Nothing belongs to everybody.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.203
That's not nice.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.752
- There are killer waves, boys. Go shred.
- It's on.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.829
- Later, Mitch.
- All right, brah.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.961
You don't want to do that, big dog.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.922
I'm an animal lover, but I will put you down.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.348
Frankie! My God, I am so sorry.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.679
Frankie, stop.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.263
Don't you know he's a friend?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.856
What a terrible, terrible way to meet.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.857
- You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?
- I am.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.815
Victoria Leeds,
the new owner of the Huntley Club.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.445
Of course. I know exactly who you are.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.370
- Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.
- Thank you so much.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.573
I heard you were a head-turner.
What an understatement that is.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.207
And I heard you were a charmer.
Guess that's an understatement, too.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.590
I apologize for Frankie.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.511
I know this beach is public and,
honestly, I wish the club was, too.

07:10.805 --> 07:14.469
- But you, you're welcome anytime.
- Thank you very much.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.300
- I'll see you around?
- Yes, you will.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.855
Okay, I get that you have to test
for image stabilization,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.403
but why'd we have to come to the beach?

07:27.489 --> 07:28.570
You know I hate the beach.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.489
Besides, I got to get back
to work at the Huntley.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.568
Well, I'm sorry, man,
but the beach is important, okay? It's...

07:33.662 --> 07:35.699
It's, you know, the wind and the...

07:36.998 --> 07:37.988
Just...

08:01.773 --> 08:02.854
I get it.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.228
- I get it now, okay. I get it.
- Who... What, C.J.?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.310
No, I didn't even know she was
working on the beach today.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.485
"I didn't know C.J. was working."

08:08.571 --> 08:10.437
- Shut up, Dave.
- Hey, Ronnie.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.440
It's Ronnie, right?

08:14.786 --> 08:16.823
What the fuck? Yeah, it's Ronnie.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.245
- I'm Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.617
- Nice to meet you.
- C.J. How you doing?

08:19.708 --> 08:20.869
I'm doing all right.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.200
You're trying out today, right?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.462
I saw your name on the board. That's how I...

08:28.675 --> 08:29.882
Say... Say something.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.175
Kinda feel like this is your year.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.756
Stop that.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.056
Okay.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.799
Well, I'll see you at tryouts.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.969
All right, C.J.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.350
That was amazing to watch.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.433
She came up to you,
she was very nice and warm.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.940
And you handled it really smoothly.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.147
- Really?
- Fuck, no. That was awkward.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.401
- It was horrible.
- Fuck!

08:53.491 --> 08:55.357
Did you have a stroke?
It felt like you had a stroke.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.907
Hey, I'm Matt Brody.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.952
And not a single fuck was given.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.537
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey, Steph.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.042
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.590
- Third time's a charm, right?
- Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm...

09:54.219 --> 09:55.255
Hey.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.802
I'm more motivated than ever.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.890
So you just need to fill out this form
and take off your shirt.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.219
My shirt. No, I don't...

10:06.523 --> 10:08.310
No one wants to see that.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.560
Take it off.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.647
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.286
Wow. Nice nipple-fros, bro. Damn!

10:22.747 --> 10:24.204
Hey, does anyone have a weed whacker?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.083
We got a comedian on the line.
What's your name, funny guy?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.831
- I'm Zane.
- You're Zane.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.249
Why don't you step out of my line, Zane?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.085
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.048
You need to understand one thing,
Zane. We're a family here.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.425
A team. And we support each other.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.091
- You're out.
- Come on, I'm... I'm Zane.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.678
- Get the fuck off my beach.
- Okay. Okay.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.185
So you're going to make me guess your name?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.438
Are you following me?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.694
I was actually just going to
ask you the same thing.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.784
Okay. Look, you're hot.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.956
I may resist for a while,
but we both know eventually I'll give in.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.407
So why don't we just skip that.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.125
Why don't you put a baby in me?

11:12.422 --> 11:13.754
- Now.
- You know, honestly...

11:14.799 --> 11:16.381
I was thinking dinner first.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.210
But we could try the baby thing, if you want.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.216
You are trying. Way too hard.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.296
Trying's the best part.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.551
- Summer.
- Hi.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.802
I was hoping we'd see you here.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.010
I couldn't sleep last night. I am so excited.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.219
Hey, it's your day today, Summer.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.314
Hey, fresh face. You here for the qualifiers?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.562
No, no, I'm not trying out.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.813
I'm actually already on the team.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.020
You're already on this team?

11:37.113 --> 11:39.321
I'm Matt Brody. Ready for duty.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.733
"Ready for duty"? Okay.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.408
You got any papers or anything like that?

11:43.494 --> 11:45.451
I do. There you go.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.288
It's a permission slip. Literally.
"Dear Mitch,

11:48.374 --> 11:51.082
"I am pleased to write you
on behalf of Mr. Matt Brody."

11:51.169 --> 11:53.502
- Right. Well, no free passes.
- Yeah.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.706
At all. Yeah, 'cause I don't give a shit.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.132
I legit needed those for my taxes.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.178
What you need is to understand
that if you're going to be on this team,

12:02.263 --> 12:03.629
- you got to earn it.
- Really?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.677
Yeah. So, why don't we
start this whole thing over,

12:05.767 --> 12:07.099
just like gentlemen?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.346
Where you from, One Direction?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.348
Iowa?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.849
- Iowa?
- You heard of it?

12:11.940 --> 12:12.930
Yeah, I know what it is.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.014
- Hey, Steph.
- Hey.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.519
New Kids on the Block here is from Iowa.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.566
Man.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.485
And he says he's already on the team.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.982
- Yeah.
- Doesn't have to try out.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.564
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.445
Let me ask you this...
A lot of oceans in Iowa?

12:23.534 --> 12:26.823
No, just ponds and lakes
and cocky pretty boys, apparently.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.074
Cocky pretty boys.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.697
Hey, Mitch, what happened to that

12:29.791 --> 12:31.157
last pretty boy recruit we had?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.617
- He died.
- R.I.P.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.542
Are you guys being serious right now?

12:34.629 --> 12:36.211
I honestly can't tell.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.584
You show up here, matching bathing suits.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.632
What is this, "lifeguard hazing"?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.799
I'm Matt Brody.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.548
I hold the world record in the 200 meter.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.754
Two gold medals.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.713
- Hey! Matt Brody.
- Matt Brody.

12:46.808 --> 12:47.889
Yes, yes.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.217
Absolutely. And we still

12:49.310 --> 12:50.596
- don't give a fuck.
- Don't give a fuck.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.350
No, fresh out. Fresh out of fucks. Yeah.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.353
Okay, that ocean out there has riptides
that'll tear your little mangina in two.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.025
My mangina?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.444
So you are being serious.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.066
Dead serious, right now, NSYNC, all right?

13:02.156 --> 13:04.239
This ain't no little
fucking pond out of Iowa.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.315
So with all due respect,

13:05.410 --> 13:07.447
you want to be here
on this team, on our team,

13:07.537 --> 13:08.698
you're gonna have to earn it.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.696
Look, I get it.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.326
You're big, Sasquatch.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.833
But I'm fast.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.002
Really fucking fast.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.623
Which is why somebody important
thinks I belong here.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.255
So when you two figure out who the fuck I am,

13:24.345 --> 13:26.302
you can find me on the beach.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.589
See you.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.893
Did that really just happen?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.265
It did. He slapped me.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.267
Yeah. His hands were soft and supple though,

13:36.357 --> 13:38.349
- like a woman. No offense.
- None taken.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.896
You know what, man? I gotta tell you,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.444
I'm feeling really good about this year.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.154
You know what I'm saying?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.731
Good luck out there, man. Good luck.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.781
Thanks.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.200
And if you need some extra motivation...

13:49.245 --> 13:50.952
- Looking at it right there.
- Hey...

13:53.291 --> 13:54.953
You okay? Help! C.J., help!

13:55.043 --> 13:56.875
My friend is choking! Help!

13:56.961 --> 13:59.374
No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!

13:59.464 --> 14:01.000
Are you okay? You're choking.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.473
Oh, God.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.553
Are you okay?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.680
- Ronnie.
- You're gonna be just fine.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.890
What?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.069
Thank you!

14:28.409 --> 14:30.446
- Ronnie, are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.911
Are you sure?

14:32.997 --> 14:34.738
Yeah, yeah. No, don't touch, don't touch.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.913
Okay.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.959
I'm so good. You did good, good, good work.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.082
Good job. Thank you, you can go now.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.209
Okay, drink some water...

14:43.299 --> 14:46.042
- Thank you so much. Okay.
- ...I guess.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.927
- Dave?
- Yeah.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.506
- How does it look?
- How does what look?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.090
Down there.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.139
- Does not look good at all.
- Yeah, what does it look like?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.441
Looks like your dick is trapped between
two slats of wood.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.360
Okay, I just... Fuck, I can't reach it.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.813
I just need you to get down there
and just pop it out.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.273
No, I can't do that at all.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.983
Come on, I just need you...
You grab that dick

15:11.077 --> 15:12.363
- and you push it out.
- No, no.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.785
Okay. Hi.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.029
I'm going to help you.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.198
We're going to deflate
the situation together. Okay?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.873
- Okay.
- Focus.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.451
Think about things that turn you off.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.621
Maybe like... Like your grandma's underwear?

15:24.549 --> 15:26.211
- Not working.
- No? Okay, cool.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.007
- Maybe, like...
- Ostriches.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.385
- Guys, still stuck.
- Mitch, hey, need you.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.087
No, no, not Mitch. Don't bring Mitch over.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.719
- Hey.
- Hey, Mitch is here.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.516
Ronnie, you pumped
about the qualifiers, buddy?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.015
You know it, man. I'm just... I'm really...

15:39.105 --> 15:41.768
Really excited to quit
my double major in robotics

15:41.858 --> 15:44.566
and computer science and really,
really do something with my life.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.984
You don't need to look down there.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.106
Do not touch me right now.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.812
- Not even touching you.
- Okay.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.740
Okay.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.613
Looks like you got
your beef and your biscuits

15:53.703 --> 15:54.819
stuck down there.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.496
It's gonna be okay.
I've been through it, too.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.244
- Not a big deal.
- Really?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.416
Yeah, absolutely.
I was stuck in a woman for hours once.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.164
Couldn't get out.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.837
- Totally the same, yeah?
- It's the same thing.

16:05.923 --> 16:06.959
Stuck junk is stuck junk.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.338
Stuck junk is stuck junk. Okay.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.715
All right, buddy, we're gonna have to
flash-freeze your johnson.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.717
No, no, it's okay, it's okay, I got it.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.888
Look, it's okay.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.345
- Oh, my God.
- Nope. Still stuck.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.385
I mean, if you think about it,
it's a good thing, right?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.016
Congratulations.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.148
Hey, how you feeling, sport?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.441
Better, but could we get

16:26.527 --> 16:27.984
some sort of perimeter going for the crowd?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.488
Nah. Nobody's looking. Just us.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.156
God, you're lying. That's a lot of people.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.029
Mitch, I can't get the swelling to go down.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.490
All right.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.908
We're going to have to pull it out.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.954
- Pull it?
- Yeah.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.953
- Just like pulling a tooth.
- What?

16:42.043 --> 16:43.375
Don't you touch my dick!

16:43.461 --> 16:44.451
I'm okay.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.630
Ronnie, are you okay?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.423
Yeah, no, I'm good.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.876
I'm proud of you, Ronnie.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.177
<i>Fuck you, Dave. You're my worst friend.</i>

17:04.523 --> 17:06.481
Captain, I need to talk to you about this...

17:06.567 --> 17:08.183
Yeah, Mitch. Look, you're just in time.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.813
I want you to watch something.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.145
Check this out.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.734
<i>Matt Brody, U.S. swimmer, sex symbol
and adrenaline junkie.</i>

17:16.827 --> 17:18.284
<i>How do I define myself?</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:21.329
<i>80% trill and 30% dope.</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:24.244
<i>People think I'm crazy,
that I'm out of control.</i>

17:24.335 --> 17:25.997
<i>How do you think I got all this gold?</i>

17:26.087 --> 17:27.203
<i>"Crazy and out of control"</i>

17:27.296 --> 17:29.128
<i>may have worked for his individual events,</i>

17:29.215 --> 17:32.128
<i>but when it came to the relay,
Brody blew it for the team.</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:35.962
<i>USA is in the lead for the team relay
and Brody's in the water to anchor.</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:38.008
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

17:38.099 --> 17:39.965
<i>Looks like he just vomited in the pool.</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:43.928
<i>After a night of partying in Rio
led to a streak of bad luck in the pool,</i>

17:44.021 --> 17:46.388
<i>Brody was dubbed the "Vomit Comet."</i>

17:47.149 --> 17:49.232
<i>How do you feel about losing
a medal for your teammates?</i>

17:49.944 --> 17:51.355
<i>There's no "I" in "team."</i>

17:53.197 --> 17:54.278
<i>But there is a "me."</i>

17:54.365 --> 17:55.526
<i>Are you dyslexic?</i>

17:55.616 --> 17:57.528
<i>I'm Caucasian.</i>

17:59.954 --> 18:02.662
This is the guy you think
is a good PR opportunity for us?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.206
Right?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.580
He's reckless, he's insubordinate. Come on.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.206
Which is why we can afford him.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.629
Come on, Mitch.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.043
The guy's only here
because he took a plea deal.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.041
A plea deal?

18:15.136 --> 18:16.547
For what?

18:17.597 --> 18:18.713
The specifics aren't important.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.516
What's important is that
we are his community service.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.888
Come on. He's a train wreck.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.435
With two gold medals.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.228
How many gold medals do you have?

18:27.315 --> 18:28.556
Probably zero. Okay?

18:30.026 --> 18:33.144
Brody is an American hero with
the face of a Swedish model.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.235
You're losing me.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.779
He's one of the best swimmers
in the whole world.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.572
There's more to this job than just swimming.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.526
- You know that.
- Yeah, there's also politics.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.328
Now, look, Mitch, let's be honest.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.996
We're staring into the abyss here.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.745
City council's already cut our funding again.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.918
What the council wants and what the bay needs

18:50.004 --> 18:51.085
are two different things.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.167
I found more flakka this morning.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.123
Clearly, we have new dealers in the bay.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.710
And this shit is like bath salts on meth.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.593
Flakka?

19:02.683 --> 19:03.924
Good work, Mitch.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.554
I'll turn this over to the police.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.059
Hey, look. This new guy of yours?
He's not ready for this kind of trouble.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.141
He doesn't need to be,
and neither do you. Okay?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.350
It's not your job.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.980
It's the busiest time of the year.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.404
I need you out there shining for me.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.277
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

19:20.368 --> 19:21.904
But he's got to pass qualifiers first.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.652
- You got it.
- Which should be easy

19:23.746 --> 19:25.829
considering he's the
"best swimmer in the world."

19:25.915 --> 19:27.076
Right?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.707
Good afternoon, Councilman.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.915
- Good afternoon.
- So, how is our progress?

19:33.381 --> 19:36.215
Most of the council
has signed off on your terms.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.340
Good.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.633
And the rest are almost there.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.252
"Almost"?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.134
Councilman,

19:43.224 --> 19:47.264
you seem like the kind of man
who knows how to seize an opportunity.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.302
Me, too.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.644
Back home, my younger brother
was given the family business to run

19:53.734 --> 19:56.272
when clearly I had the business gene.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.111
Why? Because I'm a woman.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.818
So I came to America,

20:00.908 --> 20:04.868
the Land of Opportunity,
because everything is fair here.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.945
But who's to say anymore?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.372
I have a point to prove, Councilman.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.251
And I'm here to create
an opportunity for you.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.379
I'm sure they'll come around.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.098
I'm sure they will, too.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.972
Why does she always look like
she's running in slo-mo?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.226
You see it, too?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.686
She always looks wet. But not too wet.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.816
Right.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.904
She's the reason I believe in God.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.781
Hey, how's your dick?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.365
It's good, you know...

20:48.456 --> 20:49.867
It's better, you know...

20:50.666 --> 20:51.952
It's just ready for action.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.118
Okay.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.128
I got my dick stuck in a chair earlier.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.421
- What? You did?
- Yeah.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.714
You haven't heard about this?

20:59.842 --> 21:01.629
Yeah, I heard. Everybody's heard.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.502
<i>All right. Welcome, everybody.</i>

21:03.846 --> 21:07.760
<i>You know, Baywatch proudly accepts
only one new recruit every year.</i>

21:07.850 --> 21:09.261
<i>But the good news for you</i>

21:09.351 --> 21:12.014
<i>is that this year,
we've got three open spots.</i>

21:12.188 --> 21:15.226
<i>Now without further ado,
I'd like to turn it over to the man</i>

21:15.316 --> 21:17.148
<i>who has 500 career saves.</i>

21:17.234 --> 21:19.476
<i>Give it up for Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon.</i>

21:22.615 --> 21:25.323
<i>All right, thank you. Thank you.</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:28.569
<i>Baywatch is the elite of the elite.</i>

21:28.954 --> 21:31.947
<i>Our team's commitment to
protecting the bay at all costs</i>

21:32.041 --> 21:33.953
<i>is the reason why the single mom behind me</i>

21:34.043 --> 21:36.501
<i>feels very comfortable
letting her two kids run</i>

21:36.587 --> 21:37.794
<i>right into the water unaccompanied.</i>

21:40.883 --> 21:42.249
<i>Thanks, Mitch. That's right.</i>

21:42.343 --> 21:44.835
<i>And Baywatch works because we follow rules.</i>

21:44.929 --> 21:47.797
<i>We follow rules because
if we don't, people die.</i>

21:48.098 --> 21:49.339
<i>You work in an office</i>

21:49.433 --> 21:52.096
<i>and you doze off at your desk
one day, no big deal.</i>

21:52.645 --> 21:54.853
<i>You slack off here... Say it with me...</i>

21:55.314 --> 21:56.850
People die.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.349
<i>So here's the thing,
if you've come to Baywatch</i>

21:59.443 --> 22:02.231
<i>on your little motorcycle,
thinking you're cool,</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:04.108
<i>trying to work on your killer tan...</i>

22:04.281 --> 22:06.273
<i>Well, you need to find
another beach to go to.</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:07.949
<i>But if you've come to sacrifice</i>

22:08.035 --> 22:10.197
<i>for something much bigger than yourself,</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:11.536
<i>this is the beach for you.</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:15.991
<i>But you're gonna have to
get through this first. C. J.?</i>

22:16.335 --> 22:17.667
Yeah, C.J.!

22:18.003 --> 22:20.746
<i>There are tons of qualities
that make a great lifeguard.</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:22.627
<i>Today, we're gonna test all of them</i>

22:22.716 --> 22:25.083
<i>in a grueling obstacle course we like to call</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:26.418
<i>"The Absentee Father."</i>

22:26.929 --> 22:29.012
<i>He's tough. Brutal, even.</i>

22:29.098 --> 22:31.431
<i>His presence in your life
is brief, but it will scar you</i>

22:31.517 --> 22:34.476
<i>and instill a toughness in you
that will carry you through birthdays,</i>

22:34.728 --> 22:37.641
<i>Christmases and even
"Bring Your Dad To School Day"</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:39.393
<i>when your mom has to put on a fake moustache</i>

22:39.483 --> 22:41.315
<i>just so you can fit in with the other kids.</i>

22:42.444 --> 22:43.480
<i>All right.</i>

22:43.571 --> 22:44.937
<i>Thank you, C. J.</i>

22:45.030 --> 22:46.521
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:49.278
<i>So get out there, kick ass and make us proud.</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:50.484
<i>Go, Baywatch.</i>

23:03.090 --> 23:04.080
On your mark.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.842
Get set!

23:24.486 --> 23:26.102
<i>This is Baywatch, people!</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:27.445
<i>- Kick those legs!</i>
- Let's go!

23:27.531 --> 23:29.818
- Come on, let's go!
<i>- Listen to what she's saying.</i>

23:29.909 --> 23:31.025
<i>Keep it going! Keep it going!</i>

23:31.118 --> 23:32.359
<i>You are guppies!</i>

23:32.453 --> 23:33.819
<i>One day you will be sharks!</i>

23:33.913 --> 23:35.905
<i>Pick it up, folks. Move those legs!</i>

23:37.750 --> 23:39.286
<i>Who's your daddy now?</i>

23:39.376 --> 23:40.583
<i>Come on, guys!</i>

23:46.383 --> 23:48.045
Come on, guys! Let's go!

23:48.427 --> 23:50.259
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

23:50.596 --> 23:52.758
Let's go! You got this! Come on!

23:53.682 --> 23:55.469
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

23:55.559 --> 23:57.016
Up and over!

23:58.270 --> 24:01.980
Let's go, come on! Way to hustle!
Come on, you're almost there!

24:03.943 --> 24:05.479
Kid's really got no quit in him.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.188
Attaboy, Ronnie! Great job!

24:09.281 --> 24:10.271
Great!

24:18.832 --> 24:19.822
Fuck.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.078
You know, you wanna be on our team,

24:21.168 --> 24:22.750
you're gonna have to pass this course.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.919
- We all do.
- Look. Mitch, right?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.042
- Lieutenant to you.
- "Lieutenant"?

24:28.258 --> 24:29.499
Like in the army?

24:30.636 --> 24:32.502
Let me save you some time. Okay?

24:33.180 --> 24:36.423
You're not gonna be my big brother here
and put me on the right path.

24:36.517 --> 24:37.758
It doesn't work like that.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.060
I got where I am today completely by myself.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.887
So how about you let me do my job,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.894
and I'll tell you where to send my checks?

24:45.192 --> 24:48.685
You know, sharks always swim slowly.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.817
Until they need to attack.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.023
Thank you for that cryptic

24:53.117 --> 24:54.483
and totally irrelevant piece of information.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.151
What are you, Aquaman?

24:56.412 --> 24:59.951
'Cause I'm really confused
with what we've been talking about.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.660
Come on, Gold Medal.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.616
You afraid I'm gonna kick
your <i>Little Mermaid</i> ass

25:03.711 --> 25:06.249
all over this course
in front of all these people?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.212
I mean, now you're gonna have to beat me

25:08.298 --> 25:10.255
on the big boy's course, princess.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.214
Well, that was cute.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.890
- Probably in record time.
- Yeah?

26:00.976 --> 26:02.842
The problem is, that's not the course.

26:02.936 --> 26:03.926
That's not the course?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.057
So here's what we're gonna do.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.515
We're gonna go over to the real course,
and if you beat me over there,

26:08.609 --> 26:10.225
not only are you on the team,

26:10.319 --> 26:11.730
but I won't fuck with you anymore

26:11.820 --> 26:12.901
and I'll call you by your real name.

26:12.988 --> 26:13.978
Really?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.077
Yeah!

26:41.225 --> 26:42.306
Refrigerators?

26:42.518 --> 26:45.977
...98, 99, 100!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.358
That was bullshit, Mitch.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.201
You know I was already gassed.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.324
Because you were showboating.
You want to be a lifeguard,

27:04.414 --> 27:05.530
you gotta learn to conserve your energy.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.160
Conserve my energy?

27:08.418 --> 27:09.909
No!

27:10.838 --> 27:13.125
Help! My kids!

27:13.215 --> 27:14.797
Lifeguard Tower One!

27:49.793 --> 27:50.909
Help!

27:55.090 --> 27:56.626
Look out! Look out!

27:59.136 --> 28:00.672
We're on the go!

28:00.762 --> 28:01.923
Come on, move!

28:02.014 --> 28:03.221
Yo, move!

28:03.307 --> 28:05.014
Watch it! Move, move, move!

28:08.562 --> 28:09.723
Hey, look out!

28:10.772 --> 28:12.263
Lady, get out of the way!

28:24.870 --> 28:27.032
- My kids!
- Ma'am, everything's okay.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.784
I'm here to save you. My name is Matt Brody.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.957
- Somebody help!
- Ma'am, stop it!

28:32.044 --> 28:33.876
I can't save you if you're being a dick!

28:36.548 --> 28:38.130
- Where are the other two?
- "Other two"?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.253
Shit.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.644
- Here you go. Here you go.
- Okay.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.513
Take him.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.276
You're okay.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.520
Come on.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.355
Breathe for me. Come on, big man.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.439
Come on.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.115
We'll set you down right here.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.367
Good. Let's get you over. Attaboy.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.791
- Brody, stop!
- One, two, three...

29:13.877 --> 29:15.584
- Brody, stop!
- What? Why?

29:15.671 --> 29:16.957
Her airway's blocked.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.919
- Okay, breathe.
- C.J., she good?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.637
- Steph, how is she?
- She's all right.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.973
You're gonna be good.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.266
Give me some.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.513
Let's get you to your mom.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.194
All right, guys. Hey, listen up.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.864
We want to thank you for
a great year of qualifiers.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.567
For those of you who don't
go on and become trainees,

29:47.661 --> 29:50.574
we wanna thank you,
we expect to see you next year.

29:50.664 --> 29:53.498
To the trainees who made it, congratulations.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.454
Oh, my God. I made it.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.540
I made it! Oh, my God.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.591
Thank you so much.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.009
You don't ever have to thank me.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.131
You did this one on your own.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.382
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.006
What the fuck? That's my name.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.351
That's my name!

30:13.437 --> 30:14.769
Holy shit!

30:14.855 --> 30:16.016
I made it onto...

30:16.857 --> 30:18.723
Wait. Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.

30:18.859 --> 30:19.975
No!

30:20.068 --> 30:21.604
No, I chose you because you have heart,

30:21.695 --> 30:24.062
no quit and you leave it all
out on the beach.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.531
- Thanks, Mitch.
- Congratulations.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.368
Hey, <i>High School Musical.</i>

30:30.996 --> 30:32.032
You were reckless out there.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.453
Completely destroyed
a motorcycle, which you stole.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.665
I didn't steal that.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.118
I commandeered it, okay?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.669
Because it was faster
and clearly had insurance.

30:40.756 --> 30:41.746
And by the way,

30:41.923 --> 30:45.166
the lady that I saved,
she didn't seem to mind.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.421
Let me tell you something, man,

30:46.511 --> 30:47.797
the rescues don't mean a thing

30:47.888 --> 30:49.595
if you put other people in danger. Okay?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.718
Now, I get it, you're fast, you're fearless.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.720
And I have to make you a trainee, butterfly,

30:53.852 --> 30:54.808
but you got a lot to learn.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.306
All right. Thank you, Lieutenant.

31:00.734 --> 31:01.724
All right, listen up!

31:01.818 --> 31:03.901
Training begins at 0600.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.400
Hot Wheels,
I'll see you back here in the morning.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.571
Sure thing, Lieutenant.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.278
Welcome to Baywatch.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.113
All right.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.536
Hey, I'm so glad I caught you all.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.160
I don't mean to interrupt,

31:21.254 --> 31:23.416
but everyone on the beach
is talking about you guys.

31:23.757 --> 31:24.747
Thank you.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.254
Brody, that save sounds incredible.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.214
Impulsive, but incredible.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.886
Appreciate it. See that?

31:30.972 --> 31:32.884
We're just doing our jobs.

31:34.351 --> 31:38.595
Hey, guys, this is Victoria Leeds,
the new owner of the Huntley Club.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.724
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.522
Well, I just wanted to invite all of you

31:41.608 --> 31:43.440
to the Huntley. We're having an open house.

31:43.527 --> 31:46.440
It's a kind of "meet the neighbors" thing.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.647
Look, I know that the club's kind of "fancy"

31:48.740 --> 31:50.948
and probably not your scene,

31:51.326 --> 31:53.113
but you have a standing invitation.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.325
Thank you. We'll keep that in mind.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.371
- I'll see you there?
- See you then.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.872
Let's go, Frankie.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.278
Brody?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.659
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

32:35.745 --> 32:38.078
Nothing. I was just...

32:38.290 --> 32:39.701
You know, stargazing.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.032
Under a pier?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.371
Yeah. That way.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.703
Look, you're on the team,

32:44.796 --> 32:47.755
and I don't want anyone on the team
sleeping outside, so...

32:47.841 --> 32:49.707
Yeah, come on.
You're coming with me. Let's go.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.918
Brody, let's go,
I don't want to wait for you. Come on.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.628
Thank you again, so much.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.883
Really embarrassed.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.965
Yeah, no, it's totally cool.
Don't worry about it.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.845
I forgot something in my car.

32:58.935 --> 32:59.891
Just... Just knock.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.220
You sure Stephanie won't mind? It's cool?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.271
It's cool. She won't mind at all.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.438
Thank you so much.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.232
This is really cool of you guys.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.480
No problem.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.812
What the fuck?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.616
- 'Sup.
- Hey.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.863
This is your house, isn't it?

33:16.953 --> 33:19.195
Yeah, this is... It's my house.

33:19.289 --> 33:20.245
Yeah.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.948
I assume you need a place to crash.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.829
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.036
Just like C.J., always picking up strays.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.223
Quit looking at Little Mitch! It's creepy.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.051
Come and see where you're gonna crash.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.557
There's your cot.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.432
Don't jack off on my sheets.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.562
Don't.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.444
<i>I can't find my hermit crab.</i>

33:52.531 --> 33:54.614
<i>I think he ran out earlier today.</i>

33:54.699 --> 33:57.316
<i>He's got short legs,
but he's got a fast walk, so,</i>

33:57.869 --> 34:00.361
<i>if you'd keep eyes open, I'd appreciate that.</i>

34:01.873 --> 34:04.866
<i>I will start combing the beach
first thing at sunup.</i>

34:06.378 --> 34:08.415
<i>This is Echo Bravo 153. Go ahead.</i>

34:08.505 --> 34:12.043
Fuck it. Mitch, can I please
turn the C.B. off in my room?

34:12.132 --> 34:13.543
<i>Jonas Brother, listen to me.</i>

34:13.635 --> 34:14.716
<i>Get your beauty rest.</i>

34:14.803 --> 34:16.920
<i>We're starting bright and early tomorrow.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.054
How was your first riptide?

34:29.234 --> 34:30.350
It stings!

34:30.443 --> 34:32.230
That's just the lactic acid.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.232
Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.694
What the fuck?

34:39.786 --> 34:40.902
Oh, my God!

34:40.996 --> 34:42.237
One, two, three. Cross.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.446
One, two, three.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.782
Keep your hands up. One, two, duck! Again.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.161
One, two, duck!

34:47.252 --> 34:48.458
Nice!

34:54.967 --> 34:56.630
What you doing there, killer?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.339
I don't know.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.759
- I don't know.
- Okay.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.467
Honestly, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.977
Mitch sees something in you.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.267
And I see it, too. I do.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.773
I really do.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.857
What?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.276
What?

35:17.657 --> 35:19.774
Very important lesson.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.776
That is the Devil's Urchin.

35:21.870 --> 35:22.906
One prick out of that thing

35:22.996 --> 35:25.784
will give you enough adrenaline
to choke out a pissed-off bull.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.698
The only problem is, after that,

35:27.792 --> 35:29.829
you say some crazy-ass shit,
and then you fucking die.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.795
Now pick that up and take it to Tower One.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.715
So these are just like
laying around everywhere?

35:35.884 --> 35:36.874
Do you want me to help you?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.255
Okay, look, let's just be honest, all right?

35:39.971 --> 35:41.462
I mean, we've lost him.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.801
- No, it's not your fault.
- No, Ted.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.178
Not my boy Ted.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.134
- Why, why, Ted?
- Why you, Ted?

35:47.228 --> 35:48.560
Why?

35:48.647 --> 35:51.515
Don't you do this to me, Ted!
Don't you do this!

35:53.193 --> 35:54.650
Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you

35:54.736 --> 35:56.602
because you are gonna kill
someone with that technique.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.312
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right. Okay. Ready?

35:58.531 --> 36:00.693
Wait, Summer, do you
have time to study later?

36:00.784 --> 36:01.991
Yeah.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.036
Did you just look at my boobs?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.704
I... Was not my intention.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.659
I didn't stare directly at them.

36:10.752 --> 36:11.913
You're looking at them right now.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.502
Now I did.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.829
'Cause you're talking about them.

36:15.215 --> 36:17.047
Testing. Failed.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.461
Oh, my God. Well, we're gonna be

36:18.551 --> 36:20.042
- in swimsuits a lot, so...
- Yeah.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.552
If it's gonna be a problem for you...

36:21.638 --> 36:23.300
There's not a problem for me.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.801
- At all. Cool.
- Yeah.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.632
All right. You just looked at them again.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.888
- No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...
- Yeah, you did.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.810
Well, when you point them out like that...

36:30.897 --> 36:33.014
It's a compliment
if you think about it, sort of.

36:38.822 --> 36:39.938
Victoria.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.317
I'm gonna need more time.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.697
Do I strike you as
a patient woman, Councilman?

36:44.828 --> 36:48.913
No, no, I got the council
to sign off on your real estate proposal.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.823
Just some property owners
won't give approval.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.907
But I'm working on it.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.376
Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.

36:54.963 --> 36:59.378
Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez
what we do to people who don't deliver?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.095
I know you're dealing flakka,

37:05.181 --> 37:07.639
which is gonna drive down
real estate prices in the bay,

37:07.726 --> 37:09.012
right? Right?

37:09.102 --> 37:12.516
So if anything happens to me,
I will expose you.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.139
And then you'll never get your approvals.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.228
Such accusations.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.150
I'm not a Bond villain.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.395
Well, yet.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.066
You're in politics.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.490
You know that no one can
claw their way to the top

37:24.576 --> 37:27.159
without getting a little dirt
under their fingernails.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.579
Clearly, I overestimated you.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.411
But calling me a drug dealer...

37:33.835 --> 37:36.748
It's so much bigger than that, you know?

37:36.838 --> 37:38.454
- I...
- Leon...

37:38.757 --> 37:39.918
Teach him some manners.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.383
Have fun, boys.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.377
I agree with...

37:44.471 --> 37:45.552
I overstepped.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.504
I overstepped, Victoria.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.674
Guys, we can talk about this.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.636
Leon doesn't talk. He's a man of action.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.809
- There's a purity to that.
- I'm going to kill you.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.728
Damn it. You do that every time.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.151
I build you up,
and then you ruin the mystique.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.292
- See something you like?
- Jesus Christ.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.215
You... You got me.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.090
You're gonna be cool
and go talk to her like a real man,

38:27.180 --> 38:29.217
or you gonna stand up here
and be Creepy Creeperton

38:29.307 --> 38:30.297
through the binoculars?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.007
Look, man, I'm fine in that department,

38:32.101 --> 38:34.263
- so don't worry about me.
- Yeah.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.937
I'm sure your approach to women
is Snapchatting a dick pic or two.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.480
Don't ever do that.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.984
A lot of people screenshot them nowadays.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.611
Yeah. If it leaks on the Internet,
it's terrible.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.192
Hola? <i>Is anyone there?</i>

38:46.282 --> 38:47.773
This is Baywatch.
What is your emergency? Over.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.247
<i>Please help!</i>

38:49.327 --> 38:51.319
<i>Please help! My friends and I are on a boat.</i>

38:51.496 --> 38:52.500
<i>We are lost...</i>

38:52.580 --> 38:54.287
<i>We are lost... and there's fire everywhere!</i>

38:54.415 --> 38:55.656
What is your position? Over.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.333
Gringa, <i>my position is the ocean.</i>

38:59.504 --> 39:01.040
<i>I can't feel my face!</i>

39:01.130 --> 39:03.042
Okay, call Coast Guard. We got a 10-73.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.373
- I'm gonna take the WaveRunner.
- "10-73"?

39:04.509 --> 39:05.750
You and C.J. take Rescue One.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.335
- Go, go, go!
- Rescue One, ASAP.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.132
Hold up! Wait, what, what? What are we doing?

39:09.222 --> 39:10.338
Shit.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.925
- Summer? What's a 10-73?
- Fire!

39:14.018 --> 39:15.429
"Fire"? What does that mean? In the ocean?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.727
You need to start studying!

39:16.855 --> 39:18.721
Yeah, I know. Got it. I'm there.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.022
See you out there.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.360
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm coming!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.024
- If you're comin', hurry up.
- Where's mine?

39:27.115 --> 39:28.105
You don't get one.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.322
Come on. Quit screwing around!

39:33.413 --> 39:34.654
- Could you wait for me?
- Come on.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.238
God damn it, let's go.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.581
Go, go, go!

39:41.713 --> 39:45.332
Lock your arms around my waist
or you're gonna fucking fall off again!

39:46.050 --> 39:47.712
- This is so awkward, dude.
- Hold on. Hold on.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.964
How many buckets of lotion do you wear a day?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.137
You're like a greasy, hairless gorilla.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.227
Don't worry, guys! I got it.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.521
I'll take care of... If the fire spreads...

40:06.154 --> 40:07.520
All right, I need you to take the throttle.

40:07.614 --> 40:08.730
That's impossible.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.611
Go between my arms
and take the fucking throttle!

40:17.332 --> 40:18.664
Holy shit.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.304
When I say so, hard right turn.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.343
- What?
- Three.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.260
- Two. One. Go!
- Shit, man. I don't know.

41:10.510 --> 41:11.500
Thank God.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.926
Are you the fire water man?

41:13.012 --> 41:14.002
Tell me, where are your friends?

41:14.097 --> 41:15.383
- I don't know.
- Okay. You stay right here.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.589
- Don't move. Okay?
- Okay.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.312
Help!

41:25.024 --> 41:26.356
Down here!

41:28.987 --> 41:30.728
Is anyone there?

41:31.489 --> 41:32.605
I hear you!

41:32.699 --> 41:34.782
Get to the front of the boat! We're coming!

41:34.993 --> 41:36.154
Help!

41:38.121 --> 41:39.111
Help me!

41:42.125 --> 41:43.115
Mitch!

41:50.383 --> 41:51.373
Portside.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.259
Over here!

41:58.349 --> 41:59.885
- In the front!
- Fuck.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.763
There's a girl trapped
in the front of the boat!

42:01.853 --> 42:03.219
There's too much fire!

42:05.523 --> 42:06.684
No way.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.016
C.J.!

42:12.697 --> 42:13.687
Okay, <i>guapo.</i>

42:13.781 --> 42:15.773
If you want me, you can have me.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.325
But <i>rápido</i> because the boat is on fire.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.031
- Some other time.
- No...

42:25.543 --> 42:26.624
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.043
No, I'm not okay!

42:30.214 --> 42:31.921
Help! Please!

42:34.260 --> 42:36.126
Help! In here!

42:39.891 --> 42:41.803
Do not go under that fire, Brody!

42:42.018 --> 42:43.179
Wait!

42:44.729 --> 42:45.719
In here!

42:46.147 --> 42:48.230
Please! Help!

42:48.357 --> 42:49.723
- Oh, my God!
- Take my hand.

42:49.817 --> 42:50.978
Trust me.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.442
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm okay.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.939
- Good. Hang on.
- What?

42:57.033 --> 42:58.444
C.J.!

42:59.077 --> 43:00.158
Portside!

43:05.583 --> 43:06.915
Miss, are you okay?

43:07.001 --> 43:08.082
Can you help me?

43:08.169 --> 43:09.910
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

43:28.815 --> 43:30.226
Brody!

43:40.076 --> 43:41.157
Are you okay?

43:41.244 --> 43:42.985
That was such a great plan,

43:43.162 --> 43:45.074
just to see fire and just swim right into it.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.785
You care about me.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.916
I care about you.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.626
Get off that boat, Mitch.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.735
...eight, nine, ten.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.825
Come on.

44:27.957 --> 44:30.290
Hey, other than him, we did good, right?

44:30.376 --> 44:31.457
Like, we saved everyone.

44:31.544 --> 44:32.785
Yes, including you.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.040
I know that.

44:34.130 --> 44:38.374
I'm just saying, all things considered,
things could've gone a lot worse.

44:38.885 --> 44:40.001
Come on!

44:40.344 --> 44:41.926
Is he going to be okay?

44:42.054 --> 44:43.420
Do you know what happened to the Councilman?

44:43.598 --> 44:44.884
No, I don't know.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.431
We were partying,

44:46.517 --> 44:49.351
and then when we came upstairs,
the boat was already on fire.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.400
You disobeyed an order out there,
put yourself in danger.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.110
You can't save anyone if you die.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.488
Yeah, I know. I messed up. Okay?

45:05.870 --> 45:07.361
I'm just... What are we still doing here?

45:07.496 --> 45:08.862
- Just write this down.
- Can we just go?

45:08.956 --> 45:11.118
Victim is male, five foot nine...

45:11.209 --> 45:13.792
Hey, hey, hey. Get back right now.
Do not contaminate

45:13.878 --> 45:15.039
my crime scene.

45:16.380 --> 45:17.336
Come on, Ellerbee.

45:17.423 --> 45:18.959
Don't give me any of that jurisdiction shit.

45:19.050 --> 45:23.420
No, I won't, because technically,
you don't have a jurisdiction, lifeguard.

45:23.512 --> 45:27.347
You got one job, make sure
swim-happy white people don't drown.

45:27.433 --> 45:31.268
Technically, that boat out there
is the Coast Guard's jurisdiction. Okay?

45:31.354 --> 45:33.687
And if I would've waited for them,
all these girls would be dead.

45:33.773 --> 45:34.809
- What?
- We would have died?

45:34.899 --> 45:37.186
- Burned to a crisp.
- I'm not ready to die!

45:37.276 --> 45:39.359
I know. It's okay, you're not.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.853
So technically, we saved lives.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.821
Technically, I see a dead body,

45:43.908 --> 45:46.742
which technically makes this a crime scene.

45:46.827 --> 45:49.820
Hey, technically, these "technicallys"
are wasting a lot of time, technically.

45:49.914 --> 45:51.075
Thank you, blue-eyed demon.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.912
And as far as this dead body goes, look.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.419
Badge on a uniform.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.413
Patch on a swimsuit.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.214
Lieutenant. Beat cop.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.216
So keep us informed

46:03.302 --> 46:04.759
of the investigation
and we're gonna do the same.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.087
All right. Hey, how do I keep in touch?

46:07.181 --> 46:08.422
Seashell phone,

46:08.516 --> 46:11.680
or do I just blow into the conch
and you appear?

46:11.894 --> 46:13.226
That's the spirit, Ellerbee.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.346
Just call me on the shell phone.
That's all you gotta do.

46:15.523 --> 46:16.889
I'll tell you this, if you crack this case,

46:16.983 --> 46:18.224
they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway

46:18.317 --> 46:19.899
and they're gonna give you
big-boy pants to wear,

46:19.986 --> 46:21.227
cover up those chicken legs.

46:22.530 --> 46:24.943
- Christ, that's...
- Councilman Rodriguez.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.902
Good luck, Officer.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.985
<i>I got the eye of the tiger</i>

46:30.079 --> 46:31.411
<i>A fighter</i>

46:31.497 --> 46:33.454
<i>Dancing through the fire</i>

46:33.541 --> 46:36.500
<i>'Cause I am the champion</i>

46:36.794 --> 46:40.208
<i>And you're gonna hear me roar</i>

46:42.174 --> 46:45.167
- Damn, Ronnie.
- C.J.!

46:45.261 --> 46:46.593
Please!

46:46.679 --> 46:47.965
Shit.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.963
I never really heard a guy sing that song,

46:50.057 --> 46:51.514
but you're really good.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.350
Thank you.

46:54.437 --> 46:56.975
C.J., what are you doing here?

46:57.648 --> 47:00.106
Here? It's a coed shower.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.774
Coed, cool.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.398
Cool, cool, cool.

47:04.488 --> 47:08.732
Yeah, coed is cool with me,
'cause I'm cool with the coeds.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.026
I'm taking lunch orders.
Do you want anything?

47:12.913 --> 47:16.247
I would like a salad.

47:16.334 --> 47:17.370
You sure?

47:17.460 --> 47:19.372
This place has really good cheesesteaks,

47:19.462 --> 47:22.330
meatball subs, foot-longs.

47:22.673 --> 47:26.087
- They really hit the spot.
- No, I'll have a salad.

47:26.302 --> 47:29.921
I'm just a straight-up
leafy green type of guy.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.380
That's my type of jam.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.137
Just hook me up with a salad.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.884
Okay. Salad.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.685
- Cool. All right.
- Great.

47:37.772 --> 47:43.188
By the way, when we shower in here,
we keep our suits on.

47:43.569 --> 47:46.403
Right, Phil, Sarah?

47:46.572 --> 47:48.689
But your clean nips are looking really good.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.362
- Thanks.
- Bye.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.617
Oh, God.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.211
Why me?

48:06.884 --> 48:08.546
How was your day today?

48:09.387 --> 48:11.128
I don't know. A guy died.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.760
Maybe this is why we keep losing recruits.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.966
- They can't handle it.
- Yeah.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.141
I mean, now that you know our job

48:17.228 --> 48:19.515
is much more than you expected, right,
the stakes are higher.

48:19.605 --> 48:22.268
What happened today, while very tragic,
unfortunately, it does happen.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.812
So if you want to quit,
hey, we totally get it.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.268
But if you don't and you choose to stay,

48:26.362 --> 48:28.149
just know that Baywatch is more than a job.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.355
It's a way of life.

48:29.448 --> 48:30.438
"A way of life."

48:32.076 --> 48:33.442
You and I both know I'm sticking around.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.910
Am I the only one that got a salad?

48:36.747 --> 48:39.364
Look, this is what I don't understand, okay?

48:39.458 --> 48:41.825
A guy dies. That's tragic.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.582
But that doesn't mean
that there's anything sinister going on.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.083
Okay? And even if there was,

48:46.215 --> 48:48.423
that's not our job. That's not what we do.

48:48.509 --> 48:51.502
We're lifeguards. So, this, technically,
has nothing to do with us.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.837
You just heard that cop.
He just told us that.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.888
I just thought you had to be
on a really restrictive diet

48:55.975 --> 48:57.511
to look like you guys.

48:57.852 --> 49:00.515
Brody, what is it that you think we do
here at Baywatch?

49:00.604 --> 49:01.685
I thought we were lifeguards.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.014
I thought that we prevent
people from getting sunburned

49:04.150 --> 49:06.142
and, yeah, occasionally
stop them from drowning.

49:06.235 --> 49:07.726
And that's all you think that this is?

49:07.820 --> 49:08.856
It's exactly what I thought it was.

49:08.988 --> 49:10.524
C.J., how about you throw a few

49:10.656 --> 49:13.273
of last month's cases at Olympiad here
and see what he'd do.

49:13.367 --> 49:15.233
- "Cases"?
- Okay...

49:15.327 --> 49:17.159
School of manta ray in the cove?

49:17.288 --> 49:18.699
You call Animal Control?

49:18.789 --> 49:20.325
Before Animal Control shows up,

49:20.416 --> 49:22.624
the school of manta ray
fly up out of the water,

49:22.710 --> 49:24.451
sting someone in the chest and they die.

49:24.545 --> 49:25.752
Steve Irwin, R.I.P.

49:25.838 --> 49:29.002
How about sand grifters
running a con on the beach, right?

49:29.091 --> 49:32.209
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what a sand grifter is, Stephanie.

49:32.303 --> 49:33.384
But I would probably call the cops.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.804
Sand grifters are beach thieves.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.181
Okay, so while you're working on your tan,

49:38.267 --> 49:40.384
they're stealing things
from families on the beach.

49:40.478 --> 49:41.594
I'll give you one better.

49:41.687 --> 49:44.395
How about diamond smugglers
who are putting the rocks in surfboards

49:44.482 --> 49:45.518
and bringing them ashore?

49:45.608 --> 49:47.190
Everything that you guys are talking about

49:47.276 --> 49:51.566
sounds like a really, like, entertaining,
but far-fetched TV show.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.565
But if that was the case,
I would definitely call the cops.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.945
We could call the cops, and then do nothing,

49:57.036 --> 49:58.868
like most people would. But that's not us,

49:58.954 --> 50:00.115
it's not how we operate.

50:00.206 --> 50:01.742
We watch when other people
don't want to watch.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.290
We protect when other people
don't want to protect.

50:04.376 --> 50:07.119
If we do the bare minimum,
sometimes people die.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.172
Guys, we have flakka that just washed ashore.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.092
That shit is hardcore
and it fucking kills people.

50:14.178 --> 50:15.885
And now we got a dead body in our bay.

50:15.971 --> 50:18.429
And the girls on that boat
had the same drugs on them

50:18.599 --> 50:21.091
that I found in front of Leeds's club.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.933
So my gut says that it's all connected.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.348
Wait, Leeds did say there'd be
an open house tonight, right?

50:28.442 --> 50:29.933
Yes, she did.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.060
And we're all going.

50:50.297 --> 50:51.538
What'd you find on Chen?

50:51.674 --> 50:53.415
No criminal record. No fetishes.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.424
No weird photos. He's clean.

50:55.511 --> 50:57.798
Makes me feel weird about the stuff
I have going on in my life.

50:59.265 --> 51:00.506
What about his bank accounts?

51:00.599 --> 51:01.589
Account.

51:01.684 --> 51:02.891
This dude is not rich at all.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.768
All his money is tied up
in real estate in the bay.

51:05.854 --> 51:07.641
Well, I guess you'll have to
help me persuade him

51:07.731 --> 51:08.972
some other way.

51:09.108 --> 51:10.394
Every man has a price.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.229
Speaking of which,

51:12.319 --> 51:15.062
I know you've been using
my special set of skills

51:15.155 --> 51:16.817
for your own nefarious purposes,

51:16.907 --> 51:18.569
but additional compensation

51:18.659 --> 51:22.619
would go a long way in
motivating me to keep my mouth shut.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.540
You're blackmailing me.

51:27.626 --> 51:30.243
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Dave...

51:30.671 --> 51:34.085
I really admire a man who knows
how to seize an opportunity.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.666
I'm very impressed.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.128
- Keep up the good work.
- Thanks.

51:39.805 --> 51:42.263
Do we have a deal, or...

51:42.850 --> 51:44.136
I need some closure.

51:46.478 --> 51:48.094
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.304
You look really nice.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.060
Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.812
That shirt come in big-boy size?

51:52.901 --> 51:54.108
Well, at least I'm undercover.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.526
Look at you. You didn't even try.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.855
All right, guys, we got a very big night,
with one goal in mind.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.690
It's our only shot to prove
that they're dealing here,

52:00.784 --> 52:01.774
so we gotta make it right.

52:02.661 --> 52:04.778
So, C.J. and Ronnie, find out who's selling.

52:04.955 --> 52:07.322
Summer, keep an eye on Leeds and her thugs.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.033
Then Mitch and I will search the place
for where she hides the product.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.208
- Brody?
- What?

52:11.295 --> 52:12.706
- You're our lookout.
- Lookout?

52:12.796 --> 52:15.083
Guys, if you want to find drugs at a party,

52:15.257 --> 52:16.919
I can walk in there and find drugs.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.087
It'd take me, like, five minutes.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.921
Not 'cause I do it all the time.

52:20.054 --> 52:21.636
I'm just saying it's not rocket science.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.679
Okay, troubled youth. Thank you for that.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.715
The only way this whole thing
is gonna work out

52:25.809 --> 52:27.425
is if everyone, everyone, does their job.

52:28.062 --> 52:30.145
- Can you handle that, Malibu Ken?
- Yeah.

52:32.441 --> 52:33.477
What?

52:33.567 --> 52:35.229
Why is everyone looking at me? Summer.

52:35.319 --> 52:38.608
Hey, am I the only one that thinks
this is clearly a job for the police?

52:38.697 --> 52:39.778
- Yes.
- Yes.

52:40.282 --> 52:41.363
Fuck it.

52:56.507 --> 52:59.750
Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.

52:59.843 --> 53:02.335
I wanted to meet the new neighbor
everyone is talking about.

53:02.471 --> 53:05.088
So I presume you know
why I had to invite you.

53:05.182 --> 53:08.266
I am not interested in selling my properties.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.260
Why don't you think about it, okay?

53:10.646 --> 53:14.890
I of all people know
how hard it is to run a business.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.942
You never know when a dry spell could come.

53:19.405 --> 53:20.521
What are you thinking?

53:20.739 --> 53:22.696
I think we case it
and I'll meet you back here in five.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.319
- All right. Sounds good.
- All right, Steph.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.617
So where should I, like, look out from?

53:26.787 --> 53:29.074
Hey. How are you?

53:42.553 --> 53:43.919
Victoria.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.142
You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.560
What the fuck were you thinking?

53:52.688 --> 53:54.304
They were high. They didn't see anything.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.893
They better not have.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.853
Because now Dave knows too much.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.518
And this better not come back to me.

53:59.695 --> 54:01.027
I can't have this unraveling.

54:01.113 --> 54:02.103
Got it?

54:02.322 --> 54:04.029
Now go clean up your mess.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.027
Brody.

54:09.121 --> 54:10.453
I'm so glad you came.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.030
Gosh.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.958
Let's get you a real drink.
Greg, the good stuff.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.960
- Scotch is your drink, right?
- Yeah.

54:18.046 --> 54:19.628
This is a really nice place you have here.

54:19.715 --> 54:21.172
You have great taste.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.882
I really respect that.

54:23.135 --> 54:27.254
It's nice to have somebody
who respects you, you know?

54:31.602 --> 54:33.264
I sense trouble.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.063
I think I'm just

54:38.817 --> 54:40.103
not used to having a boss.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.109
Mitch is threatened.

54:42.196 --> 54:44.062
He should be thrilled to have you.

54:44.239 --> 54:45.571
Yeah, you'd think.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.152
Oh, my God.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.943
"Lieutenant Matt Brody."

54:50.120 --> 54:53.329
That has such an amazing ring to it.
Don't you think?

54:54.750 --> 54:55.831
Yeah.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.456
Here. Keep the whole bottle.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.462
I think you need it.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.380
- This'll be fun.
- Thank you.

55:06.470 --> 55:07.460
Hey.

55:07.554 --> 55:09.045
Did you get any intel on Leeds?

55:09.139 --> 55:11.005
- Yeah, I got intel.
- That's awesome.

55:11.099 --> 55:14.137
Single malt 35-year-old intel.

55:14.228 --> 55:15.719
And it's fucking delicious.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.183
All right, I think I got something.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.605
Found our access point.

55:19.691 --> 55:21.557
Where is Brody? Have you seen him?

55:21.652 --> 55:22.688
No. No time.

55:22.778 --> 55:24.110
We gotta move without him.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.482
Yeah, but we need our lookout.

55:25.572 --> 55:27.108
What's your deal? You like torturing guys?

55:27.241 --> 55:29.028
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

55:29.117 --> 55:32.861
Well, I mean, I have three brothers,
so I've had a lot of practice.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.329
I take it you're an only child.

55:35.415 --> 55:36.405
I don't know, honestly.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.490
You don't know?

55:37.584 --> 55:39.997
- I grew up in a foster home.
- Shit.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.958
- Three of them, actually.
- I'm sorry.

55:43.048 --> 55:44.038
Don't be.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.418
It was pretty cool. One of them had a pool.

55:45.509 --> 55:46.750
If it wasn't for that pool,

55:46.844 --> 55:48.380
I probably wouldn't have
gone to the Olympics.

55:48.470 --> 55:49.927
Yeah. I mean, that's amazing.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.426
Go from foster home to winning a gold medal.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.758
- Two.
- Two gold medals.

55:54.893 --> 55:58.102
And I fucking busted my ass
for those gold medals,

55:58.188 --> 55:59.850
so you can't blame me for celebrating.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.564
Yeah.

56:02.150 --> 56:04.187
I mean, I've always wondered
what happened that night.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.904
I knew the relay was the next day,
but those guys...

56:08.323 --> 56:10.610
They didn't care about me.
They just needed me to win.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.318
Well, you certainly made sure
they did not win.

56:13.620 --> 56:16.237
I lost way more than they did.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.322
Okay? I lost all my sponsors.

56:18.417 --> 56:20.875
I'm an Olympic champion
and I'm fucking broke.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.454
- Ronnie, hey.
- What?

56:24.548 --> 56:26.961
Okay, listen. I need you
to create a distraction for Leeds.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.006
What? How?

56:28.093 --> 56:29.254
Remember the first time I met you?

56:29.553 --> 56:30.794
The night at Chen's?

56:30.888 --> 56:31.924
Yeah.

56:32.639 --> 56:33.629
What? No.

56:33.724 --> 56:34.840
- Yes.
- No!

56:34.933 --> 56:35.923
- Yes!
- Mitch, no!

56:36.018 --> 56:37.008
- Yes. Yes!
- No!

56:37.102 --> 56:38.309
- No!
- God damn it, Ronnie.

56:38.395 --> 56:39.761
You listen to me, and you listen good.

56:39.855 --> 56:43.724
Every team has a ringer,
and you and only you are my ringer.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.642
Well, then I guess I'm your ringer.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.648
You are my goddamn ringer.

56:49.615 --> 56:51.447
- Ring, ring?
- Ring, ring.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.576
Yeah. Oh, God.

56:57.497 --> 56:58.829
Could I...

57:01.501 --> 57:02.537
Will you just have one drink with me?

57:02.628 --> 57:04.290
You should probably actually stop drinking

57:04.379 --> 57:06.086
because you're supposed to be
the lookout for Mitch.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.081
I am looking out for Mitch.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.884
Leeds is right there.
I'm gonna go check it out.

57:13.722 --> 57:14.883
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

57:14.973 --> 57:18.307
<i>A warm welcome to our host, Victoria Leeds!</i>

57:20.020 --> 57:21.511
Thank you. Thank you.

57:21.605 --> 57:22.766
<i>So many people.</i>

57:24.191 --> 57:27.434
<i>So as a welcome to the bay, I...</i>

57:28.195 --> 57:30.357
<i>Oh, God. Mitch, this is for you.</i>

57:30.697 --> 57:32.279
<i>Wait. No, Victoria.</i>

57:32.366 --> 57:35.825
<i>I have something very special
planned for you, for everyone.</i>

57:36.078 --> 57:37.660
<i>So God help us.</i>

57:39.289 --> 57:41.406
I'll just put that down. Okay.

57:42.834 --> 57:43.824
Hit it.

58:23.417 --> 58:24.749
That's weird.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.292
Who's Angelo's Fish Company?

58:26.378 --> 58:28.290
Doesn't the Huntley
get their fish from Flynn's?

58:28.463 --> 58:29.795
Let's check it out.

58:31.925 --> 58:33.587
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:40.851 --> 58:41.932
Mitch.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.181
I just got a little hunch, okay?

58:46.440 --> 58:47.556
Shit.

58:48.775 --> 58:51.062
You two, what are you doing back here?

58:51.403 --> 58:52.564
Hey.

58:52.654 --> 58:55.021
First date. You can't blame me, right?

59:07.252 --> 59:08.743
So juvenile.

59:09.087 --> 59:10.123
I'm onto you all.

59:10.756 --> 59:11.872
Ladies and gentlemen,

59:11.965 --> 59:14.799
put your hands together
for whatever that was.

59:34.488 --> 59:36.024
You did good, Ronnie.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.402
Where'd you learn to dance like that?

59:41.036 --> 59:42.243
Hebrew school.

59:49.461 --> 59:51.123
You were supposed to be there for us tonight.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.454
You had a job to do.

59:53.799 --> 59:55.540
And now you're trashed.

59:56.301 --> 59:58.213
See, I just... I don't understand this, man.

59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.636
If you really think that there's drugs here,

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:01.883
call the police.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.339
And then what?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.593
We get a few minnows?
The big whale gets away?

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.302
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.264
I dare you to say one thing
without the ocean in it.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:12.689
I dare you.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.025
We were depending on you tonight.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.607
And you fucked up... Again.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.734
Watch yourself.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.239
Really?

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.998
Get this through your head, Mitch.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:33.586
You're not a cop.
You're not the fucking Equalizer.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.246
You're a lifeguard, Mitch,

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.172
who sits in his fucking tower all day,

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.967
'cause that's the only place
he has any sort of power.

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:43.259
This is the real world, Mitch.
Lifeguards can't do shit.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.463
Come on.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.765
Don't fucking touch me.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.101
- Let's go.
- Or what?

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:50.974
What're you gonna do, Mitch?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.148
Shit.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.442
- Shit.
- I didn't touch you.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:01.568
You dick.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.493
Cool off, pool boy.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.950
That's him! The Vomit Comet!

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.798
What are you guys standing around for?

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.507
Let's do some shots!

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.959
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.211
Summer, this is your day today.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.458
Yeah, I know it.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.760
Mitch?

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.178
Hey, man, I think...

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:59.061
I think we both said a few things
last night that we didn't mean.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.393
Not me. I meant every word.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:03.523
Come on, man.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.071
You've never gotten drunk
and said something you don't mean?

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.611
Seriously?

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.327
I fucked up, man. I know that.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.411
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.127
I watched you win two gold medals.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.471
You were amazing when it was just you.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:34.554
But when it came to the relay,

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.352
being part of your team,
your Olympic team, your family,

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.520
you blew it. 'Cause you're selfish.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.311
Baywatch is our team. Baywatch is our family.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:47.279
These are the keys to our house.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.406
But you've proven to me

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.233
that you don't want to be
part of this family.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.445
So you're done.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.367
'Cause the only thing you give a shit about

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.081
is yourself and your medals.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.830
You talking 'bout this medal?

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.179
That's really impressive.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.926
Don't you have two of them, though?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.345
That's not the point.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.509
That's polluting.

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:19.807
Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.184
I should have listened.

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:23.854
I want to be a part of this team.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.358
And I will not let you down again, I swear.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.739
And by the way,
I think you're right about Leeds.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.995
And the Councilman... Councilman...
What's his face?

01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:38.865
- Councilman Rodriguez.
- Yeah.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.041
Rodriguez, that's it. The dead guy.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.665
He had this watch. It was a nice TAG watch.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.462
Yeah, I've seen that watch, too.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.206
On one of Leeds's thugs.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.174
That's it. See?

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.925
I want to help, man. And I want to...

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.548
I want to help.

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:09.107
All right. I'll give you another shot.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.232
Councilman Rodriguez is connected
to all of this somehow.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.902
And the coroner's office
just released his body.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.615
And I got a plan.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:29.415
Guys, I still don't understand
what part of the plan this is.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:32.547
- Just go with the flow, Brody.
- Yeah, you were in a very bad accident.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:34.720
- It was all your fucking fault.
- We're all really, really sad.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.970
It was my fault? Why was it my fault?

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.889
Come on, guys. I need a bigger coat.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.686
There's no coat in here that's gonna fit you.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.479
- You got a better idea?
- I think I do.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:49.443
But you're not gonna like it.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.525
Okay, clear. Come on, let's go.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.196
Okay, left turn, left turn.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.740
What the fuck?

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:01.072
Who taught you how to drive,
Stevie fucking Wonder?

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.374
You're huge, man. Very hard to control.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.247
Just get me to the morgue. That's all I said.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.827
I'm taking us to the morgue. Go left.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.583
Left, left. Left turn.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:10.039
Careful.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:11.666
Okay. We're clear, we're clear.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.004
All right.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:18.464
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.174
- What does that say?
- "Morgue."

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:21.258
Exactly.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.602
I got us to the morgue.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.810
- Nice. Good job.
- Yeah.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:28.766
These disguises are awesome.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.851
I actually feel like a doctor.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:37.407
Oh, no.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.406
- Read me his toe tag.
- It smells like yogurt.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.745
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.661
"2816."

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:51.588
Read me line 12.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:53.923
Jesus.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.880
Line 12. "Alveoli are clean."

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.303
Wait, that means
that there was no smoke in his lungs.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:00.593
- So how did he die?
- That's the question.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.299
McDreamy, get over here.
I need you to help me.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.180
Oh, God, what?

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.764
Dude.

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.814
I need you to check his taint
for needle marks.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.392
You want me to check his taint?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.148
Don't be a baby. Lift his scrotum.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:14.274
Not touching the man's scrotum.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.481
Lift his ball sac
and check for anything unusual.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:17.690
There's... Fuck.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:20.658
Oh, my God.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:28.038
- Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.
- You didn't even look.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.375
My God.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.331
Dude, there's been gloves here
literally the entire time.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.588
You didn't even say anything. Yeah... That...

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.847
I'm going in.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.552
- All right.
- Tell me what you see.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:46.977
Hair. Lots of hair. Definitely not a groomer.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.850
Get deeper. Lift the balls up higher.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.982
- And get closer.
- Oh, God, it stinks.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.610
I don't know, man. There's a big something.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.103
There's something. There is a hole.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.902
- That's just his butthole.
- Smile.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:04.237
Good job, doc. I'm posting that.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.538
Do not post that. The Internet is forever.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:09.408
It's just a handful of ball sac.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.251
It's disgusting.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.420
Oh, God.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.669
Dude, I can't take you seriously
when the dick is out.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.715
Can you please just cover the dick?

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.259
You cover the dick. I'm busy.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.591
All right, check this out.

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:25.890
Cervical fractures of the fifth, sixth
and seventh vertebrae.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.310
That's how he was killed. Broken neck.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.604
So, what? That could have happened any time.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.522
I mean, you jumped off
the boat with him, right?

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.100
You can literally swan dive
down a flight of stairs

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:36.354
and not break that many vertebrae.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.187
This was done on purpose.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.484
Why has no one else figured this out?

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.817
What are you talking about? Figured what out?

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.277
Broken neck in multiple places.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.783
No smoke in his lungs,
which probably means he died

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:49.285
before that boat was even on fire.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.082
The reason why no one has figured this out?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.205
It's murder.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.919
- And someone's covering it up.
- Holy shit.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.292
In which case,

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.792
I should go interrogate those girls.

01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.966
No, those girls were too high.
They don't remember anything.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:01.794
All the more reason to investigate.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.430
Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:06.801
- Hide. Hide!
- Put him away.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.515
- What do we do now?
- Now we hide.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.395
Hide? Where?

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.902
I don't like confined spaces.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.283
This was a bad idea.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.660
Stop being a baby.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:29.196
Oh, my God!

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.122
Shut your mouth. You're gonna get us caught.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:32.950
I'm laying on a dead old lady.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.501
Well, she's not going to bite you,
for Christ's sakes.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.577
- Will you shut up?
- Our drawers are empty.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.707
Why'd you pick that drawer?

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.876
I'm the only one with a body in my drawer?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.046
Shut up!

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.216
She smells like cheese toast and chowder.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.511
Holy Christ.
You just tickled another man's taint.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.758
Who gives a shit right now?

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.560
This was a bad...

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.559
Something just dripped on me.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:55.856
Shut your mouth.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.524
- What is it?
- It's all right.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.691
Oh, my God.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.983
- It did it again.
- Nothing's dripping on me.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.986
- Listen to me. Formaldehyde melts fat.
- What?

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:07.614
That's what's dripping on your face,
necrotic liquid fat.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.911
Now will you shut the fuck up?

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:10.112
What the fuck did you just say?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.788
Just sit back and shut up.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:13.533
Stop complaining.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.756
Guys, someone's coming. Be quiet.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.131
It's him.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.351
Rodriguez. It is him.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:38.774
You got the fake files?

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.313
Relax.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.650
We're only here
'cause you broke his fucking neck.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:53.572
It's all good.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.408
- God damn it. Keep it together.
- No!

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.373
- Oh, shit.
- That's it! I'm out!

01:10:58.463 --> 01:10:59.795
No. God damn it!

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.878
- Shit!
- Fuck.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.887
What do we do?

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:27.568
Hey, gentlemen.

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.777
Now that that's over,
I'm gonna need those files.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.407
Shit.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.411
That must be my phone.
I probably left it in the nap room.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.709
- Shit.
- Fuck. Give me that phone.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.828
Shit!

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.663
No, lifeguard.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.585
That was a cheap shot, man!

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:54.932
Damn it.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.557
I'll get the car.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.138
All right, meet us
on the far side of the park!

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.519
- Come on, let's roll.
- Mitch, hold up.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:03.559
Check this out.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.817
Excuse me. That's a very nice scooter.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:09.815
Have you ever seen the Olympics?

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.868
- Why are you grabbing me so tight?
- Why the fuck are you driving?

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.991
Stay off the grass. It's freshly fertilized.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:16.909
Stay on the pathway.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.615
I'm on the path, man. They're right there!

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.075
- Watch it, watch it!
- Shut up!

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.001
You got a beautiful border collie
right there. Don't hit him!

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.454
You do not respect anything.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.047
Stop. Have some respect. Mommies and babies.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.749
- Mommies and babies.
- Yeah, I see them.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.927
Go get them. Stay on the pathway.
You get the white one.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.674
All right.
You're just slowing me down, anyway.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.682
Give me the phone.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.146
Hey!

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:04.749
Shit! Oh, my God.
I can't believe I just did that.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.169
- I cannot believe I just did that!
- Hey, Summer. Here. Hey.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:10.171
- Oh, my God!
- Where's your phone?

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:16.173
That's not my phone!

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.850
- Summer, you okay?
- That guy's got my phone.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.269
- Nice work!
- Thanks!

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.933
- Where'd he go?
- Oh, shit.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.412
Mister, get off!

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.210
Hey, Mitch, take this one.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.253
Yeah. Thanks, Mikey.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.587
Hey, man, this is a wake-free zone!

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:07.641
Hey!

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.661
Hi, honey.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.414
I'm going to go get rid of
the bad man that's in your house.

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:06.783
Eat your food.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:08.710
Why is he here?

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:32.897
I'm gonna need that phone.

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:36.021
This phone?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.744
Whoops. Fuck your phone.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.072
You're going night-night, bitch.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.572
<i>I'm a pig.</i>

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.745
Wait! Hey, hey.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:26.954
No baby pictures.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.453
- Have some class.
- You're right.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.149
It's bath time, shithead.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.403
All right, Ellerbee, what did
we learn from the perps

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.480
after the interrogation?

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.357
The only perps here are you three.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:05.076
Okay, you turned the canals
into the goddamned X Games.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.946
Yeah, that's 'cause we were
in lifeguard pursuit.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.290
Okay. My bad.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.790
Except for there's no fucking such thing
as "lifeguard pursuit"!

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.038
Police do pursuits!

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.751
When you do it, it's just
some guys chasing some other guys.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.131
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.763
Hey, what are you saying?
You're just gonna let those guys walk?

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:28.308
Okay, how do I explain this
so that you people understand?

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:29.430
"You people"?

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.469
"You people"?

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.263
You don't get to say that.

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:34.473
You're just tan.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.392
- Right on.
- Come on, brother.

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:39.941
Look, even if you were police,

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.401
which you're not,

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.199
and even if this was
your jurisdiction, which it isn't,

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:48.787
and even if you had probable cause to pursue,

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:50.489
which you definitely don't,

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.870
what you did would still be totally illegal.

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:56.245
Okay, well, I mean,
it's a good thing we're not police, then.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:18:00.879
It's like you purposely
only hear 1% of what I say.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:05.170
Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.722
to break into the medical examiner's
office earlier today?

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.015
Yeah, you bet I did.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.808
Absolutely, 100% and here's why.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:13.808
The Councilman's boating accident
was no accident at all.

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.355
He had no smoke in his lungs,

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.932
his neck was broken in multiple places.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.019
Which means he was probably dead
before that boat even caught on fire.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.604
And our investigation has found
that all of this shady shit

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:24.489
leads right back to the Huntley.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:27.447
You don't do investigations.
You're lifeguards.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.118
Police do investigations.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:30.366
When you do it,

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:33.039
it's just a bunch of guys
investigating another bunch of guys.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.367
- No offense, you're included in that.
- None taken.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.169
Do you have any proof of this conspiracy?

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.962
Yeah, absolutely.
We read the coroner's report.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.715
It's all in there before
those other guys switched it.

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:45.293
Yeah, and I recorded
the whole thing on my cell phone.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:47.136
- Where's the cell phone?
- They destroyed it.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:50.344
Okay.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:53.268
So the only evidence that
you had was destroyed.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:56.639
Exactly. All the evidence...

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.357
Gone. Doesn't exist.

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.981
They're bad guys
and they don't want us to have it.

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:03.102
Okay.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:04.858
Let me try to explain this to you

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:06.065
in a way that you people can understand.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.569
"You people"? There it is again.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.993
- Hey, hey. Be cool.
- There it is again.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.195
Just trying to figure out what the fuck was

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.324
with "you people."

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:13.495
All right, now, look.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.785
Leave law enforcement to the police. Okay?

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:22.297
And you guys just do the jobs
that I hired you to do.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.129
You remember? The lifeguarding stuff.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:28.511
- Splish, splash.
- Otherwise, I'll fire you.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.511
Now I gotta go clean up
this mess that you made.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:40.106
Obviously, you have every reason
to be upset, and I apologize.

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:52.194
So, do you always do the opposite
of what people ask you to do?

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.575
Because I don't know, man,
it looks clear to me.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.240
Nice and quiet.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:02.079
No, man, you got to look closer. I knew it.

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.288
Flynn's Seafood Company.

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:04.998
What about Flynn's Seafood Company?

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:07.709
They're the ones who supply all the fish
to the Huntley Club, right?

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:10.261
- So?
- So the question is,

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.213
who the fuck is Angelo?

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:16.806
I saw barrels like that down in the Huntley,

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.511
and now they're on the back of her yacht.

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:20.141
Oh, my God. Mitch, you're impossible.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.440
My gut says there's some
bad shit going on over there,

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.643
and my balls say we need to
go over there and check it out.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.069
- Yeah. Your balls said that?
- Yes, they did.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.114
'Cause my balls say, "Hey, just take it
easy right here. Just chill."

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.282
Why the fuck do your balls
sound like three-year-old girls?

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.659
I don't know, man. That's just how they talk.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.071
But they're wise.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:37.656
Well, tell your shriveled, wise balls

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.867
we're going to the Huntley
to see what's in those barrels.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.581
Dude, we are penetrating
the shit out of this place.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:47.707
No, I think it's "infiltrate."

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.175
That's what we want to do. To infiltrate.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.923
You know they're gonna be looking for us.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.549
That's why we're going undercover.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.047
Undercover? In disguise?

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:01.770
Remember. Undercover.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.060
- Undercover, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.559
Check it out. I'm undercover.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.015
Yeah. A little too undercover.

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:46.316
Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.439
What do you mean, why the heck
am I wearing makeup?

01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:50.111
- It's a little much.
- What was I supposed to do?

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.356
Well, what we're supposed to do
is find the fucking flakka.

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.532
- Oh, my God.
- Angelo's Fish Company. There it is.

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:56.405
You are so selfish.

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:57.827
You think this was easy?

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.324
It's very impressive, princess.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.122
But please shut the fuck up and focus.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:10.289
Come on.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:21.304
Holy shit.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.679
Can't believe Leeds is doing
that shit during the day.

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.435
Yeah. That takes balls.

01:22:29.736 --> 01:22:30.726
Holy shit.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.187
It's like <i>Breaking Bad</i> in there.

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.439
Yeah, dude, <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:38.318
- You were right.
- Yeah, I was right.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:40.745
Let's get him in!

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:42.197
- I got here.
- Right.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.164
- Yep.
- We're good.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.749
- Grab his other leg.
- Got it.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:50.963
Get a stretcher ready.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.420
Yeah, this is the police.
How can I help you, lifeguard?

01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:59.840
Ellerbee, you got to get down
to the Huntley ASAP.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.469
We found the drugs.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.222
Yeah, that sounds great, Mitch,

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.645
but right now I'm busy dealing
with another dead body.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:08.189
<i>Oh, and this one's on your beach.
Did you hear that?</i>

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.858
First a councilman and now a shark attack.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.230
That's crazy.

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:13.728
Lifeguard coming through.

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:15.526
You're still calling this
your jurisdiction, right?

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:17.403
<i>We haven't had a dead body
on the beach in years.</i>

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:19.567
<i>But this has got to be connected
to the Huntley.</i>

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.786
We found the drugs here.
I'm telling you. They're behind this.

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.831
Mitch, it's Thorpe, your boss.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.375
Look, stop with the Huntley crap, okay?

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.248
And don't even come down here.
We don't need you.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.795
Just meet me back at headquarters.

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:33.840
Right now I gotta deal with
your new publicity nightmare.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:35.754
Fuck!

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.506
<i>Emerald Bay is reeling this afternoon</i>

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.009
<i>from the shocking discovery
of another dead body.</i>

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:42.385
<i>But in the wake of the recent
death of Councilman Rodriguez,</i>

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.433
<i>the locals here want answers.</i>

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.139
<i>I can't believe that no one was at Tower One.</i>

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:49.598
I don't even know what to say.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.350
Whose shift was it?

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.068
Sir, it was mine.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:56.187
And where were you?

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.024
Stalking one of the most prominent
women in Emerald Bay?

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.734
Blatantly disregarding your jurisdiction?

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.785
Sir, I only stepped away
to check out the Huntley

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:05.738
- and find the flakka.
- I warned you.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:07.911
I warned you about sticking to your job.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.037
This wasn't even Mitch's fault.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:10.914
You leave me no choice.

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.245
You're done.

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:14.706
I want you off the beach.
I'm putting Brody in charge.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.174
No way.

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:19.969
- There's not a chance... Hey...
- You can do this in your sleep.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.047
That's not what I'm saying.
I don't want the position. I don't...

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.097
You have two gold medals, okay?

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:27.014
You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming,

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:29.562
minus the total paralysis part.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.935
Unless you want me to replace you
with someone else.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.688
With all due respect,
that job should go to Stephanie Holden.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:36.269
She knows the bay better than anyone.

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:39.280
I'm no longer interested
in your opinion, Buchannon.

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:41.069
Dismissed.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.661
Brody. Brody, hang back.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.076
Okay, it's just me and you now.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:54.829
If you can help me
keep your new pals in line,

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.710
I can make sure that you stick around here

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.257
for a long, long time.

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.669
And if you don't,
your probation could get fucked up.

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.220
- Good talk, Brody.
- Okay.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.598
You're my dawg, right? I'll see you tomorrow.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:11.600
Bring it in.

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.356
I fucked it up.

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:18.144
Turn in your trunks, Mitch.

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.149
I'm going to go.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.414
What, you think that I wanted this?

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.991
- It kinda looks like you did.
- What?

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.576
If anyone should get the job
it should be Stephanie.

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:34.831
No shit. I couldn't agree more.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:36.829
What would you have done?

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.581
I wouldn't have taken the job,

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.041
even if they'd offered it to me.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.797
It was not an offer, it was a trap.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.844
Guys, guys, come on. Please.

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.259
All right? I need you
to work together to help

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.343
Bieber here figure out
why there's a dead body on our beach,

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.019
and how Leeds is bringing in
drugs to the bay.

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.315
Good luck.

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.033
Mitch.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.451
Yo, Mitch!

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:17.878
I'm sorry.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.424
I want you to have something.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.017
My mentor gave me this.

01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.561
It's the keys to Lifeguard Tower One.

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:38.557
Your new post.

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:40.727
No. I'm not ready.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:43.229
I'm not ready for this, man.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.068
They need you.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:05.259
<i>Hi, Mitch. Just checking in on you again.</i>

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.004
<i>Please call us back. We're worried about you.</i>

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:11.348
No, thanks, man.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:14.760
Excuse me, ma'am...

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.782
<i>Yo, Mitch. It's Brody.</i>

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:38.706
<i>I hit you on the C.B.,
so I know you're listening.</i>

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:42.914
<i>I hope you haven't gone crazy
and started eating carbs or something.</i>

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.799
<i>Everyone says hi. Come back, man.</i>

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.048
<i>I could really use your help, brother.</i>

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:07.651
You know, well, it all depends
on the data plan that you want.

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:08.822
Internet, everything like that?

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:11.659
It's all fantastic with the Internet, sure.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.907
It's Internet-savvy in function

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:15.329
- and there's broadband...
- All right.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:16.823
...you gotta have that. Yeah, sure.

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:21.287
Samsung has all the capabilities
of the I.T. process, and...

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.995
Mind if I cut in for a second?

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:25.123
What are you doing here?

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:27.004
I'm here to remind you who you are.

01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:32.050
Come on, buddy.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.843
Snap out of it!

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.181
Shoes?

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.768
You're wearing worker man shoes?

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.815
Really, how far have you fallen?

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:46.353
- Far.
- I'd love to buy a...

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:49.605
- Mitch?
- Yes, Mitch.

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:51.858
Come on, man.

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:54.035
You don't just protect the bay.

01:28:55.038 --> 01:28:56.154
You are the bay.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.199
Mitch, the bay needs you.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.681
Hey, do you guys know of
any good bars around here?

01:29:19.062 --> 01:29:21.304
Hey, do you guys know
where you can rent a bike?

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.814
- Yeah, right up that way.
- This way?

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.890
Not too far away.

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:26.021
All right, cool. Thank you, guys.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:30.146
Sand grifters.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:45.536
Get the fuck out of here! This is my beach!

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:47.667
All right, we're out of here!

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.375
Did you see that?

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:05.264
Hey.

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:07.604
You guys want to help me figure out
whose stuff this is?

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:10.854
Yo, this cooler is... Cool.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.024
Yo, Ellerbee?

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:16.734
What's up, man? How you doing?

01:30:17.621 --> 01:30:20.705
Lieutenant Brody! What you got in the cooler?

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.248
Black market organs from
the Boogie Board Bandits?

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:25.497
You mean this?

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:26.794
No, no.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.712
This is actually for you.

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:30.881
You see, I'm not Mitch, right?

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.299
I know my place.

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.752
I'm just a lifeguard. And that's it.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:39.465
I just want to make sure that you and I
start out on the right foot. That's it.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:43.724
So I went ahead and got something
a little bit special for you.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:47.231
Which is a double-chocolate
smoothie from Chen's.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.351
- A double-chocolate smoothie?
- Yeah.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:52.945
- From Chen's?
- They're the best.

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.272
You know, I shouldn't.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:56.615
But it is my cheat day.

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.495
It's your cheat day.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:02.662
Exactly.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:06.500
And by the way, I went ahead and added
that extra protein for you, dawg.

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:08.585
My man.

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:10.880
- I know you're trying to keep up.
- Yeah, man.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:25.845
Summer.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.848
Hey, Summer.

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:32.147
Come on, Summer.

01:31:36.616 --> 01:31:38.528
I think I found something big here, okay?

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:40.317
I really need your help.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:44.120
Please?

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.621
- You took marine biology, right?
- Yeah.

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:51.246
Look at these. Tell me what you think.

01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:54.628
Do these look like shark bites to you?

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.461
No, they don't all look like shark bites.

01:31:58.555 --> 01:31:59.921
Hey, let me take a look.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:03.549
God, I can't deal with blood.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.435
I mean, that one might be.

01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:08.725
Those definitely are not.

01:32:08.898 --> 01:32:10.685
So they could be, like, knife wounds.

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:12.141
Yeah, maybe.

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:15.728
Oh, my God, that's Dave!

01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:18.234
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:20.483
Hey, stop looking at the picture, dude.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:21.818
Ronnie, Ronnie, what did you just say?

01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:23.118
- That's Dave.
- Who's Dave?

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.240
I used to work with him.

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:27.289
- What do you mean? Doing what?
- Tech stuff.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.116
- You wouldn't understand.
- I would understand!

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.166
What kind of tech stuff?

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:31.619
Holy shit! That's it.

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:33.204
Dave told me that he was working with Leeds

01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:34.914
on something for the Huntley.

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:37.174
Oh, my God. Fucking Mitch was right.

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:40.594
Both of these bodies were dead
before they hit the water.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.796
Mitch got set up.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.761
Leeds got rid of him and we're probably next.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:48.018
- Shit.
- Ronnie, I need your help.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.512
- No.
- Yes.

01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:50.938
- No.
- Yes.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:52.974
Yes. Please?

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:54.650
- Okay, fine.
- We really appreciate it.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.773
Because as much as I know about laptops,

01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.445
I don't know shit about computers.

01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:03.359
So Dave had access to Leeds's server.

01:33:03.787 --> 01:33:04.994
Her server, you mean her network.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.616
Yeah, her network. That's what I meant.

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:10.199
Okay. So we just take a flash drive
and we plug it in, you know.

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:13.206
Get into her cloud and then
steal all her cookies, right?

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:14.377
And then we're...

01:33:14.464 --> 01:33:15.750
Straight through the firewall.

01:33:17.383 --> 01:33:19.375
Literally none of
what you said made any sense.

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:20.459
Straight over the firewall.

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:21.885
It's not like a physical thing you do.

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:23.382
Okay, I don't know what
I'm talking about here, dude.

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:25.385
- Just... Can you do it?
- Yeah, it's done.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:26.803
It's been done this entire time?

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:28.134
- Yeah, man.
- Shit,

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.345
- well, what did we find?
- We found a lot of dirt.

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:32.896
Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.190
"Dirt"?

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:36.892
What the hell are we supposed to do
with dirt, Ronnie?

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:38.193
I meant evidence.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.395
- Evidence.
- Evidence.

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:41.230
Well, why didn't you say so, man?

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.316
- Heck, yeah!
- Thank God you're pretty.

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.943
I'm really proud of you, man.

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:49.659
<i>Guys, we did some digging.</i>

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:51.699
And Mitch was right.

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.456
The Huntley is a front
for a giant drug operation.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:57.087
But I figured out
it's not about drugs for Leeds,

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.835
it's about real estate.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:00.791
And she's planning on making
the entire bay private.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.632
- Yeah, but the town would never let her.
- Yes, it will.

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:07.427
Because she has every
single politician in this town

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:08.507
on her payroll.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:09.887
Rodriguez, the taint guy.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:11.935
- What about the business owners?
- Yeah.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:14.764
Well, most of them sold out
and signed away their properties.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.690
Leeds blackmailed the ones who didn't

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.938
and used Dave to help
hack into their accounts.

01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:21.566
I mean, she's like some sort of
modern-day J. Edgar Hoover.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:22.692
The vacuum guy.

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:23.856
No.

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.151
But there was one holdout.

01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:28.110
- Who?
- Chen.

01:34:28.204 --> 01:34:31.663
And if anything happens to him,
his property goes back to the city.

01:34:33.543 --> 01:34:34.875
Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:36.918
- We have to warn him.
- I tried.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:39.247
- No one's seen him for days.
- What?

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:42.337
But Leeds is having a party
on her yacht tonight.

01:34:42.427 --> 01:34:44.965
I guarantee you, she found a way
to get that guy into her boat.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:47.800
Which is why we're gonna go to that party.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:50.424
What?

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:53.682
Summer, you and I
are going to find the flakka.

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:55.558
You guys find Chen.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.727
Will it work? Maybe.

01:34:57.817 --> 01:34:59.809
Will there be some surprises along the way?

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:01.519
Abso-fucking-lutely.

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.070
Is anyone going to die?

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:06.740
I don't know. Maybe Ronnie.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:08.116
Sorry, what?

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:10.035
But we are Baywatch.

01:35:12.165 --> 01:35:13.372
We save lives.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:15.950
I know because you guys saved mine.

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:20.333
Let's go kick that bitch's ass.

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:22.919
- Let's do it.
- For Mitch.

01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:43.895
Thank you.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:50.113
- Lifeguards, this is a surprise.
- Oh, hi!

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:54.243
Victoria, we wanted to come here
in person and tell you

01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:57.120
how excited we are to be working with you

01:35:57.252 --> 01:36:00.211
instead of against you, now that...

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:02.792
- Now that...
- Mitch is gone.

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:06.630
He's gone, so all we care about now
is protecting the bay.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:08.631
And we know you feel the same.

01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:10.633
I do.

01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:12.806
I always knew I liked you two.

01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:17.803
- Enjoy the party.
- You look amazing, by the way.

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:20.772
Well, someone has to.

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:32.989
What? What are you wearing?
Where are your sleeves?

01:36:33.079 --> 01:36:34.411
Listen, I know where the flakka is.

01:36:34.497 --> 01:36:36.910
- What, where? Under the boat?
- Yeah. Potentially.

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:38.286
Please don't die.

01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:39.992
Do you think we should kiss?

01:36:40.378 --> 01:36:41.414
I think we should kiss.

01:36:41.504 --> 01:36:43.837
Otherwise, we may never know

01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:47.166
what it was like. If I die...

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:48.671
Maybe we should talk about it later.

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:52.212
It was worth a try.

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:53.639
- It was a good try.
- Fuck. All right.

01:36:57.312 --> 01:36:58.644
Okay.

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.938
Don't do anything too stupid.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:02.681
I won't.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:03.250
- Summer. Summer!
- Yeah, hey.

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:05.373
She's been smuggling it under the boat
this entire time.

01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:07.079
- No shit?
- We have to let Mitch know.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.089
Okay, yeah.

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:10.757
But Mitch hasn't answered
the phone since he was fired.

01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:12.334
Fuck.

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:14.677
The C.B.! Use the C.B.

01:38:14.764 --> 01:38:16.505
- He's always listening on the C.B.
- Okay, yeah.

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:18.932
Tell him, Brody found the flakka

01:38:19.018 --> 01:38:22.682
and that he needs to meet us
at the marina at 0900.

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:25.856
0900 is 9:00 a.m.,
so 9:00 p.m. would be 2100.

01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:28.525
That system is so stupid and flawed.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.898
Okay, well, militaries use it
all over the world.

01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:32.320
But I'll tell him 2100.

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:42.447
Hey, guys.

01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:50.459
I'll bet Lurch over here knows where Chen is.

01:38:56.431 --> 01:38:57.922
Mitch, if you can hear me, you were right.

01:38:58.015 --> 01:38:59.847
We found the drugs on Leeds's boat.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:02.301
Shit!

01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:06.809
Hey. No guests allowed upstairs.

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:10.563
Then I guess that means
that you and I are all alone.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:14.655
And you look like a bad boy.

01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:17.487
How about we get into some trouble?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.364
Too much champagne.

01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:27.993
Miss?

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:35.300
Stephanie! Damn!

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:36.422
Chen!

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:39.258
Hey, hey.

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:41.010
- Are you okay?
- She was going to kill me.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.090
- It's okay.
- Shit!

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:43.221
What the fuck is going on?

01:39:44.854 --> 01:39:46.140
Shit.

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.346
Put your hands where I can see them.

01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:51.141
Oh, my God.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:52.271
- Summer!
- Oh, my God.

01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:53.477
Did I kill him?

01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:54.937
No, you just knocked his ass out.

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:56.112
Thank God.

01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:57.565
Here's the key. Here's the key.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.532
All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:02.281
And let's get you out of here
and call Ellerbee, okay?

01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:03.657
- What about Leeds?
- Ronnie and I will stay here and

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:04.784
keep an eye out for her, okay?

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:06.206
- What? We will?
- Yes.

01:40:06.626 --> 01:40:07.787
Okay, yeah, we will.

01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:10.711
We're going to be on the villain's boat.

01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:14.247
Jason Bourne ain't got shit on me!

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.927
If I could please have your attention.

01:40:20.765 --> 01:40:22.757
By this time tomorrow,

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.433
the expansion of the Huntley
will be official.

01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:31.060
But for now, let's enjoy the caviar,
the champagne and the fireworks.

01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:32.557
Cheers.

01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:36.107
We have a problem.

01:40:41.577 --> 01:40:44.069
Wrong time to grow a conscience, Brody.

01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:47.865
Chen's getting away.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.164
How is Chen getting away?

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:53.541
Fucking idiots!

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.546
They're trying to trap us. Plan B.

01:40:55.633 --> 01:40:56.999
Get the chopper to meet us at the barge.

01:40:57.093 --> 01:40:58.083
We need to get the fuck outta here.

01:40:58.177 --> 01:40:59.213
What do we do about him?

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.549
Do what you were supposed to do with Chen.

01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:03.756
<i>We got Chen off the boat.
Do you guys have eyes on Brody?</i>

01:41:03.849 --> 01:41:05.135
No, we still haven't seen him...

01:41:05.268 --> 01:41:07.134
<i>- What!</i>
- ...and we lost Leeds.

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:10.392
Wait! Good news. We found Leeds.

01:41:10.523 --> 01:41:11.809
Bad news.

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.936
She's got Brody in a cage
on the back of a boat.

01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:16.143
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- Let's go. Come on.

01:41:16.279 --> 01:41:18.441
Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:20.818
Such a shame.

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:22.612
Why'd you have to go snooping?

01:41:24.996 --> 01:41:27.659
Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:30.494
What?

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:33.828
Thorpe? What are you talking about, "Thorpe"?

01:41:34.297 --> 01:41:36.960
You haven't figured that part out yet.

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:39.879
Where I bribed him, you know,
got Mitch fired,

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.380
put your dumb ass in charge.

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:43.921
All you had to do was be a lifeguard.

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:45.263
Get a tan.

01:41:45.349 --> 01:41:48.513
But instead, you tried to be like Mitch
and save the bay.

01:41:48.811 --> 01:41:50.803
Now let's see how long
you can hold your breath.

01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:53.309
No, just listen to me. Just listen...

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:55.390
God... Fuck!

01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:57.317
No! You have to listen to me!

01:41:57.403 --> 01:41:58.564
You're fucking crazy.

01:41:58.654 --> 01:42:00.646
If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."

01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.946
- No!
- Let's go, boys.

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:03.194
You have to listen to me!

01:42:03.326 --> 01:42:04.658
Have a nice swim.

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:36.791
What the fuck?

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:41.171
Damn it, brah!

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.081
Fuck!

01:43:57.481 --> 01:43:58.938
- Thank you.
- Where's Leeds?

01:44:01.026 --> 01:44:04.770
Leeds is gonna escape in a helicopter
on that fireworks barge.

01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:07.109
- Not if we stop her first.
- What?

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:10.442
Come on, buddy.

01:44:11.287 --> 01:44:12.698
How?

01:44:12.788 --> 01:44:13.778
Watch and learn.

01:44:14.749 --> 01:44:15.739
Ronnie, come in.

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:17.324
<i>Holy shit, Mitch, you got him!</i>

01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:20.703
Yeah, he's alive and he's well.

01:44:20.796 --> 01:44:22.412
<i>Ronnie, I need you to figure out a way</i>

01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:23.876
to launch those fireworks.

01:44:24.133 --> 01:44:25.294
Listen to me.

01:44:25.468 --> 01:44:26.549
I want you to light up the sky.

01:44:26.635 --> 01:44:28.126
- Okay. Got it, Mitch.
- Got it.

01:44:30.347 --> 01:44:31.633
That's got to be her boat up there!

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:35.425
- There's the console.
- Go.

01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.347
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:44.359
Fucking lifeguards!

01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:46.528
What a nuisance! Take care of them already!

01:44:48.407 --> 01:44:50.273
- What the fuck? Holy shit!
- God damn it, get down!

01:44:52.328 --> 01:44:55.287
<i>Miss Leeds, I'm approaching the barge.
I'll meet you at the top.</i>

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:56.988
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:44:57.082 --> 01:44:58.289
Holy shit.

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.910
- She's gonna get away!
- Shit, shit, shit!

01:45:01.003 --> 01:45:02.835
Ronnie, C.J., right now. Let's do this.

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:05.585
Yeah, yeah, Mitch. We're on it. Fuck!

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.178
I've never seen any interface like this.
I don't know what to fucking do!

01:45:16.268 --> 01:45:17.679
Hey! Look at me, look at me, look at me!

01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:18.977
You are the tech guy.

01:45:19.939 --> 01:45:23.774
You are the motherfucking tech guy.

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:31.322
I'm the motherfucking tech guy.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:33.445
<i>Come on, Ronnie.</i>

01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:37.029
- All right, let's go.
- I'm behind you, dude.

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.497
All right, watch your step.
There's urchins everywhere.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:42.075
- What, the ones that kill you?
- Let's go, partner.

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:43.660
I like the sound of that.

01:45:44.797 --> 01:45:45.878
Shit!

01:45:46.507 --> 01:45:47.623
What the fuck!

01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:51.172
God... Oh, my God, I got it!

01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:54.504
- And I'm in.
- And... Fire!

01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:01.432
Holy shit!

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:06.358
It's working, he's turning!

01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:08.351
- It's go time.
- Right.

01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:11.946
What the hell is taking you so long?

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.694
<i>All right, Miss Leeds. Circling around.</i>

01:46:15.828 --> 01:46:17.660
Could you put that dog down already?

01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:25.330
Second level! Fire!

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.086
Take that, motherfucker!

01:47:02.958 --> 01:47:03.994
Mitch!

01:47:08.297 --> 01:47:10.914
The fireworks are almost done.
And then you can land.

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:12.081
Holy shit!

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:14.751
And come to this side, you imbecile!

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:20.340
Fire.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:22.426
None of them are working anymore.
I think it's over.

01:47:23.437 --> 01:47:26.145
Honey. As usual,
I have to do everything myself.

01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:32.356
- Mitch!
- Don't bother. He's dead.

01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:35.355
- Because of you.
- Of course because of me.

01:47:35.574 --> 01:47:37.987
You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?

01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:42.157
So impulsive.

01:47:43.624 --> 01:47:45.456
That's why you walked right into my plan.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:47.117
Leeds!

01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:50.454
For fuck's sake. Why don't you die already?

01:47:50.631 --> 01:47:52.338
Let the little boy go.

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:54.458
That's not how this story ends, Mitch.

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:56.884
You see, you're not here to save him.

01:47:56.971 --> 01:47:58.963
After all, he took your job.

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.422
So you shot him.

01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:03.054
But not before he got
a shot off that killed you.

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.385
I don't know.
That seems a little complicated.

01:48:05.646 --> 01:48:07.353
Yeah, that sounds cheesy.

01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:08.555
You won't get away with this!

01:48:09.191 --> 01:48:10.807
I already have, Mitch.

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:12.650
You know the best thing about winning

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:16.525
is that you get to write the story
of what happened.

01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:17.981
Isn't that right, Mr. Gold Medal?

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.070
- Fuck you, lady.
- Pass.

01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:23.194
What's that?

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:24.825
What the hell?

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:27.248
It's a big red button.

01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:31.335
The big red button.

01:48:39.263 --> 01:48:40.424
Time to die, boys.

01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:42.589
No!

01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:45.141
I was born of the sea!

01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:48.095
I eat fire coral and I piss saltwater!

01:48:48.564 --> 01:48:51.523
I scratch my back with a whale's dick,

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.897
and I loofah my chest with his ball sac.

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:56.019
What the fuck?

01:48:57.531 --> 01:49:01.275
I'll die when the tide stops
and the moon drowns!

01:49:01.744 --> 01:49:03.030
Until then...

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:11.451
Go, baby.

01:49:12.838 --> 01:49:14.670
I'm oceanic, motherfucker.

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:16.171
How tacky.

01:49:33.734 --> 01:49:35.726
- Mitch, you just blew her up!
- Yeah.

01:49:35.819 --> 01:49:38.778
Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now

01:49:38.864 --> 01:49:39.854
on Devil's Urchin.

01:49:43.744 --> 01:49:45.235
You stabbed yourself with one of those?

01:49:45.329 --> 01:49:46.615
I thought that was supposed to kill you.

01:49:46.747 --> 01:49:48.613
It does.

01:49:48.707 --> 01:49:50.790
And I'm in desperate need
of medical attention.

01:49:55.798 --> 01:49:57.255
That wasn't so bad.

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.009
That's good luck. Pick it up.

01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:04.088
- What? What?
- God, there's so much blood.

01:50:04.890 --> 01:50:07.098
- What?
- God, why do I keep looking?

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:13.013
What took you so long with Leeds?

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:15.682
I didn't want to make it seem like
it was too easy.

01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:17.896
The adrenaline kept you alive.

01:50:18.737 --> 01:50:20.103
Thank God you make us carry these.

01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:22.105
Take it easy.

01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:24.107
You saved your own life this time.

01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:27.910
- Thank you.
- Yes.

01:50:29.498 --> 01:50:30.705
Hey...

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:33.658
So I hear you were...

01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:37.211
You were right the whole time. And...

01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:43.217
I owe you an apology.

01:50:44.638 --> 01:50:45.845
Owe you an apology.

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:53.515
No apology needed.

01:50:54.898 --> 01:50:56.480
I mean, we saved the bay.

01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:00.811
So you can hit us
on that shell phone anytime.

01:51:02.948 --> 01:51:03.984
Come on, brother.

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:07.533
- My man.
- My man.

01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:08.860
Hey!

01:51:08.954 --> 01:51:11.367
What part of "You're fired"
do you not understand, Mitch?

01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:14.661
Get the fuck off my beach
or I'll have you arrested.

01:51:15.377 --> 01:51:16.584
Hey, Thorpe.

01:51:20.174 --> 01:51:21.164
Oh, my God.

01:51:23.677 --> 01:51:25.839
This is our beach, bitch.
And you're under arrest.

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:31.011
That was a badass right cross, Brody.

01:51:33.812 --> 01:51:35.178
You just said my real name.

01:51:50.329 --> 01:51:51.536
Hey, killer.

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.906
Hey.

01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:57.538
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:51:59.161
Do you want breakfast?

01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:01.120
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

01:52:01.882 --> 01:52:03.293
- Pancakes?
- Yeah.

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:04.840
- Bacon?
- Yeah.

01:52:07.221 --> 01:52:08.211
Cinnabon?

01:52:13.852 --> 01:52:15.639
- I saw you do that.
- You're still there.

01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:18.142
Yup, just the... Bacon sounds good too.

01:52:23.612 --> 01:52:24.853
Good morning.

01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:27.739
That was a hell of a punch, mister.

01:52:27.824 --> 01:52:29.611
- Thank you.
- I mean,

01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:31.408
it's not exactly in
the lifeguard manual, but...

01:52:31.745 --> 01:52:35.580
Well, I told you I would learn better
if I had a study buddy.

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:39.784
Don't get ahead of yourself.

01:52:40.712 --> 01:52:41.748
Oh, my God. Did you just...

01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:43.871
Look at my dick?

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.960
Now we're even.

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:58.803
Oh, my God.

01:52:58.897 --> 01:53:00.980
We're late. We have to go. Come on.

01:53:03.068 --> 01:53:04.400
I found something.

01:53:09.783 --> 01:53:11.445
- How'd you get this?
- Well, it washed up on shore.

01:53:11.535 --> 01:53:12.776
You only threw it eight feet, dude.

01:53:18.333 --> 01:53:19.869
Thank you.

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.701
You're welcome. You're very welcome.

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:24.538
Guys, after finding the drugs,

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:25.751
helping save Chen

01:53:25.841 --> 01:53:28.675
and helping me blow up the bad girl
with a Roman candle,

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:32.838
it's a pleasure to say you are
officially no longer trainees.

01:53:34.975 --> 01:53:37.217
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, guys.

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:38.893
Hey, guys, one more important thing.

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:40.936
I want to introduce you to our new captain

01:53:41.023 --> 01:53:42.605
who has been running our Hawaii division

01:53:42.691 --> 01:53:44.273
very successfully for years now.

01:53:44.526 --> 01:53:46.688
The amazing Captain Casey Jean.

01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:04.668
Is it just me, or is she in...

01:54:04.755 --> 01:54:06.872
- In super-slow motion?
- Yeah.

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:11.341
This is gonna take a while.

01:54:12.179 --> 01:54:13.340
That's how we roll.

01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:34.357
Oh, fuck!

01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:54.878
- All right, here we go.
- I think we should roll with it. Let's do it.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.718
Yeah, we saw it in the coroner's...
Coroner's...

01:54:59.017 --> 01:55:00.804
Yeah, we saw it in the corn...

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:02.180
Coroner's. We saw it in the coroner's report.

01:55:02.312 --> 01:55:03.302
It was in the coroner's report.

01:55:03.397 --> 01:55:04.979
I'm gonna get it. "In the coroner's report."

01:55:05.065 --> 01:55:06.522
Yes, we saw it in the coronary's report.

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:10.192
- Ronnie.
- What?

01:55:10.404 --> 01:55:12.691
Stop looking at the donuts like that
and dump them.

01:55:24.459 --> 01:55:25.870
Oh, boy, that was fun.

01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:30.080
You're like a dolphin on cocaine,
but not annoying at all.

01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:33.591
You're like if a human fucked a jet ski...

01:55:33.718 --> 01:55:35.710
Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.

01:55:35.804 --> 01:55:36.794
What?

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:38.595
Okay, I got this.

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.679
- Come on, dude. Hurry up.
- Fuck, how'd you do that?

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:43.930
Because I'm fucking strong. Let's go.

01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:45.557
What do your balls say?

01:55:45.647 --> 01:55:48.105
"Don't follow Mitch's balls.
Mitch's balls be stupid."

01:55:50.277 --> 01:55:51.688
Your hidden balls want to go to the cartel?

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:53.485
- Right now.
- It's just a third testicle.

01:55:53.572 --> 01:55:54.904
My balls are talking...

01:55:57.367 --> 01:55:59.108
I need you to check his taint
for needle marks.

01:56:01.913 --> 01:56:02.994
God damn it.

01:56:03.999 --> 01:56:05.285
It's... And hairy.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.457
God, it's getting really fro-y in here.

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:08.868
Smile.

01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:18.544
Love your chest, it is so...

01:56:21.308 --> 01:56:23.391
I like your chest as well.

01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:25.601
It doesn't work
when you say it back to me like that.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:31.140
Hey, C.J., why do our suits
ride so far up our asses?

01:56:31.276 --> 01:56:32.938
It makes us faster in the water.

01:56:51.046 --> 01:56:52.787
Did you just... Please.

01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:54.372
I hope that doesn't make the boob-lers...

01:56:54.716 --> 01:56:55.832
All right.

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.334
I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.

01:56:58.678 --> 01:56:59.668
I really would.

01:57:02.057 --> 01:57:03.969
Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?

01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:06.766
You're joking.

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:08.890
No, I've been Mitch Buchannon for 20 years.

01:57:09.147 --> 01:57:10.604
Am I gonna be in the sequel?

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:11.931
I think you should be in the sequel.

01:57:14.027 --> 01:57:16.110
Do I look like
a tiny little asshole next to him?

01:57:16.196 --> 01:57:17.186
- No.
- Okay, good.
