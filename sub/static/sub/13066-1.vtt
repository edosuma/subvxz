They've scheduled the hearing
for the Burmese.

01:44.691 --> 01:48.081
- Where are you going?
- They should have a copy.

01:48.451 --> 01:51.284
You're crazy.
It's pouring out there.

01:52.251 --> 01:53.479
I know.

02:21.691 --> 02:26.128
WOMAN: I'm not sure where to start.
You're probably fast-forwarding already.

02:26.371 --> 02:27.963
We shouldn 't be here.

02:28.171 --> 02:32.005
We're from Ohio. A dinky
little town called Upland.

02:32.211 --> 02:35.521
I'm Alice Marano.
My best friend is Darlene Davis.

02:35.771 --> 02:38.410
- I don't know about Hawaii anymore.
- What?

02:38.611 --> 02:42.126
It's like a bunch of tourists
on family vacations.

02:42.371 --> 02:46.284
We met as babies, crawled to each
other on a neighbor's lawn.

02:46.531 --> 02:48.886
That's what my mom used to say.

02:49.131 --> 02:51.122
Get closer to your sister.

02:51.331 --> 02:54.641
Teachers said I was the bad one,
Darlene was good.

02:54.851 --> 02:59.049
We didn 't care. It was a joke to us.
We knew how we were.

02:59.251 --> 03:01.640
It was always the two of us.

03:01.851 --> 03:05.002
Doug, could you take
a picture of me and Alice?

03:05.211 --> 03:07.441
Darlene was going to college.

03:07.651 --> 03:10.723
We decided to have a knockout
trip together.

03:10.931 --> 03:13.491
Celebrate our sorrows. After that...

03:13.891 --> 03:18.089
...for the first time in our lives,
we wouldn 't be together.

03:20.011 --> 03:22.286
So it had to be amazing.

03:23.491 --> 03:25.049
Memorable.

03:26.531 --> 03:30.729
Hawaii seemed so middle-class.
Like our parents ' version of fun.

03:30.931 --> 03:33.081
I wanted it to be special.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.680
Not that she would ever forget me.

03:39.851 --> 03:44.288
Then someone mentioned Thailand.
It was as simple as that.

03:44.571 --> 03:48.041
Strange how little things
make big things happen.

03:48.251 --> 03:52.881
Ferg told us his brother spent
a summer in Bangkok for under $500.

03:53.091 --> 03:55.559
I learned that Thailand means freedom.

03:55.771 --> 04:00.287
A country named after
the exact thing we were looking for.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.369
- I thought you wanted to go.
- I do. It's my dad.

04:03.571 --> 04:08.167
- You're so afraid of him.
- He's already being a dick...

04:08.371 --> 04:13.081
...about my off-campus apartment.
Now I'm going to Bangkok.

04:13.571 --> 04:17.882
- What'd you tell your dad?
- I said you were going, he said okay.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.127
He doesn't care anyway...

04:20.370 --> 04:23.681
...as long as I still have
my exciting career.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.887
Just don't tell your dad.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.121
Let him think we're in Hawaii.

04:29.331 --> 04:32.687
It's only 11 days.
How's he gonna find out?

04:37.971 --> 04:41.884
Dar worried about lying
for nine hours of the flight.

04:42.091 --> 04:46.130
By the 24th hour,
she was too tired to care.

04:56.931 --> 04:59.491
It took forever to find the hotel.

04:59.771 --> 05:02.331
Funny what forever used to feel like.

05:02.571 --> 05:03.890
This is it?

05:04.771 --> 05:08.446
- Doesn't look royal.
- How much royal do you want for $6?

- Oh, God!

05:59.251 --> 06:01.082
It's a huge roach!

06:38.291 --> 06:41.249
DARLENE: Thais have so much respect
for their monarch...

06:41.451 --> 06:44.568
...that up until
Rama III changed the law...

06:44.771 --> 06:47.524
...no one could utter
His Majesty's name.

07:03.171 --> 07:05.890
Buying and then releasing
captive animals...

07:06.091 --> 07:08.321
...is also considered meritorious.

07:08.571 --> 07:12.883
A number of vendors around Bangkok
sell birds for this purpose.

07:24.851 --> 07:28.082
- God, enough with this heat.
- Exactly.

07:28.291 --> 07:32.842
I'm tempted to jump in the river.
How bad can raw sewage be?

07:33.051 --> 07:37.920
They dump human waste, bathe
and drink, all in one river.

07:39.771 --> 07:41.489
Give me that geek book.

07:44.251 --> 07:46.924
Tell me you brought a bathing suit.

07:47.171 --> 07:49.890
- But I'm not going in there.
- Come here.

08:00.251 --> 08:03.960
DARLENE: What if we're caught?
ALICE: Go in like you own the place.

Welcome to first class.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.890

- 414.

- Let's make him pay.

09:15.411 --> 09:16.207
Damn right.

09:16.691 --> 09:17.487
Exactly.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.443
You say room number 414?

09:19.651 --> 09:23.166
414? That man number 414.

09:23.371 --> 09:26.681
I was sure...
Oh, it's 416. I'm sorry.

- Our room's up there.

09:29.691 --> 09:31.409
What's your name?

09:31.611 --> 09:34.728
This is really inappropriate.
Our room...

09:36.131 --> 09:38.008

you two anywhere.

of a blur of hotel rooms.

Excuse me.

10:10.851 --> 10:13.888
- We'll pay you back.
- No worries, it's fine.

10:14.091 --> 10:17.686
- Can we get you a drink?
- It's the least we could do.

10:19.131 --> 10:20.484
Okay.

10:20.891 --> 10:25.282
I'll take it for the wanker in 333
who left his key in the men's room.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.084
Come on.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.690

Don't worry. You're in the fake Rolex
capital of the world.

- Australia. But I'm never there.

10:49.971 --> 10:53.725

company all over Asia.

Getting paid to sun-bake.

11:00.931 --> 11:03.320
Oh, God. Quick, eat rice.

25:18.571 --> 25:21.529
Nor is there a plane reservation
in his name.

25:21.731 --> 25:22.846
No Nick Parks.

25:23.051 --> 25:26.043
But that's impossible. Check again.

25:26.251 --> 25:30.290
We're quite thorough,
and of course we'll keep at it.

25:30.731 --> 25:35.486
At this point, I must advise you
to consult with an attorney.

25:36.091 --> 25:37.285
I'm sorry.

25:39.051 --> 25:42.930
If you repent, plead guilty
and ask for mercy...

25:43.171 --> 25:45.082
...the judge will be lenient.

25:45.331 --> 25:47.128
No more than 40 years.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.690
I'm not guilty!

25:48.891 --> 25:52.327
If you plead not guilty
and don't prove...

25:52.571 --> 25:54.323
...you get life sentence.

26:16.771 --> 26:18.682
It's just until the trial.

27:00.211 --> 27:01.007
You wash.

27:12.771 --> 27:14.682
Dar, come on.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.483
ALICE:
I wasn 't even that scared at first.

27:28.691 --> 27:30.682
I'd had worse haircuts.

27:30.891 --> 27:35.726
I believed if we could hold on
until the trial, it'd be over...

27:35.931 --> 27:38.081
...like a nightmare.

27:39.771 --> 27:42.763
I didn 't know it was all rigged here.

27:42.971 --> 27:45.610
Like those birds you buy to set free.

27:45.811 --> 27:49.281
They're really trained
to fly back to their cages.

27:50.691 --> 27:54.047
Because that's all freedom is:
An illusion.

28:27.291 --> 28:30.488
Waiter, there's a bug in my snot.

28:31.851 --> 28:33.887
The fruit looks okay, though.

28:35.331 --> 28:37.561
You like? Go take.

28:39.371 --> 28:40.281
Thanks a lot.

28:49.611 --> 28:51.010
Kneel down.

28:51.211 --> 28:52.849
- Like you're praying.
- She...

28:53.051 --> 28:55.201
Do the down-facing dog.

28:55.411 --> 28:56.685
Make it super-size.

28:58.691 --> 29:01.080
She said we could get some fruit.

29:28.731 --> 29:32.326
- You have to earn the food.
- How do you earn it?

29:32.531 --> 29:35.728
Put in your time. Take one of those.

29:48.971 --> 29:53.010
WOMAN: I was so high, I didn't notice
my visa had run out.

29:53.211 --> 29:55.930
I couldn't pay the fine to leave.

29:56.171 --> 30:00.608
A bloke I met said he'd pay the fine
and give me some pocket money.

30:00.811 --> 30:04.929
I just had to take some packets
and stuff them inside me.

30:05.131 --> 30:08.089
You're telling that
smack-in-the-box tale again?

30:08.251 --> 30:10.685
Yankee girl.

30:13.531 --> 30:16.967
- What's with her?
- She thinks you're fun to piss off.

30:17.171 --> 30:21.403
You're the new show
at the brokedown palace.

30:21.611 --> 30:25.445
- When's checkout time?
- Check out anytime, man.

30:25.651 --> 30:29.485
You find freedom here
and in here...

30:29.971 --> 30:31.370
...and in here.

31:18.851 --> 31:21.888
- What's with her?
- She thought she'd get pardoned.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.806
Everybody thinks they'll get a pardon
from the crown. Makes me sick.

31:26.011 --> 31:30.289
Addicted to fantasy. That road
leads straight into the ground.

31:36.171 --> 31:39.527
It happened at least once.
The old mama-san...

31:39.771 --> 31:42.410
...she was here one day
and gone the next.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.121
- The guards were in a proper lather too.
- What happened?

31:46.331 --> 31:47.844
Nobody knows.

31:48.051 --> 31:52.727
We think a certain guard opened
the gate, and she just walks away.

31:53.891 --> 31:55.722
Which guard was it?

31:55.931 --> 31:58.889
Velie. We think Velie.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.759
So someone bribed Velie? With what?

32:04.971 --> 32:08.361
I heard it was $ 100 for the gate
and a car waiting.

32:08.571 --> 32:11.244
Please. If they catch you escaping...

32:11.451 --> 32:13.919
...they add 15 years to your sentence.

32:14.131 --> 32:17.123
Mama-san could have been shot
in the street.

32:17.371 --> 32:19.931
All this talk is a waste of time.

32:20.131 --> 32:23.123
You should get in touch
with Yankee Hank.

32:23.331 --> 32:25.686
- Who?
- Yankee Hank.

32:25.931 --> 32:31.085
- He's a barrister. That's a stretch.
- Yankee Hank's a damn good lawyer.

32:32.971 --> 32:36.088
If he's so good,
how come you never called him?

32:36.291 --> 32:39.124
An impoverished soul like myself?

32:39.331 --> 32:41.765
He like American folding money.

32:41.971 --> 32:43.290
You're not lying.

32:43.531 --> 32:47.843
Of course, if I had the dosh,
I'd try Velie first.

33:21.171 --> 33:22.490
Dad!

33:24.171 --> 33:25.399
I'm so sorry.

33:25.611 --> 33:26.885
What?

33:27.131 --> 33:29.440
I'm sorry I lied about Hawaii.

33:29.651 --> 33:31.369
Honey, it's all right.

33:31.571 --> 33:36.201
We're gonna get you out of here.
Don't worry. Whatever it takes.

33:36.411 --> 33:38.288
Tell everyone I didn't do it.

33:39.971 --> 33:42.929
- What?
- We didn't do it!

33:43.131 --> 33:46.248
They know that. Everybody
knows that, baby.

33:46.451 --> 33:49.284
Everybody back home
misses you, sweetie.

33:49.531 --> 33:54.047
- Why would you want to come here?
- I'm so sorry.

33:54.251 --> 33:57.163
That's all right.
We'll find a way, okay?

33:57.611 --> 34:00.489
Everything is gonna work out,
I promise.

34:00.691 --> 34:02.204
It'll be okay.

34:03.691 --> 34:05.761
I love you.

34:17.291 --> 34:19.565
He's going to get us out.

34:19.771 --> 34:23.286
- He said us?
- Yeah, he wants to see you.

34:31.731 --> 34:34.768
You always thought
you were so smart.

34:36.051 --> 34:38.360
I hope you're proud of yourself.

34:39.491 --> 34:41.800
- Mr. Davis...
- You're a schemer.

34:42.011 --> 34:45.367
You think I don't know you?
You are dead wrong.

34:45.610 --> 34:48.842
Every word out of your mouth is a lie.

34:49.650 --> 34:53.405
Six years old, paint on your hands,
on our couch.

34:53.771 --> 34:55.329
"I didn't do it."

34:55.571 --> 35:00.281
16 years old, the beer cans
in my car. "I didn't do it."

35:00.651 --> 35:03.324
Let me hear you say it again.

35:03.531 --> 35:05.681
Say it in here.

35:06.091 --> 35:08.207
Come on, for old times' sake.

35:10.291 --> 35:13.089
I didn't do it!

35:18.851 --> 35:20.807
I'm so glad he's here.

35:21.451 --> 35:23.521
He's being so great about it.

35:23.731 --> 35:26.768
He really knows
how to grease the wheels.

35:26.971 --> 35:29.246
He'll know what to do.

35:29.451 --> 35:31.567
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

35:31.771 --> 35:34.080
- Why aren't you excited?
- I am.

35:34.371 --> 35:36.931
Did he tell you
he spoke to your dad?

35:37.451 --> 35:38.930
Goddamn it!

35:39.171 --> 35:40.001
You like?

35:40.371 --> 35:41.690
Good fish heads.

35:43.211 --> 35:46.009
No! It's a matter of days now.

36:16.371 --> 36:19.169
DARLENE:
I told the detective the truth.

36:19.611 --> 36:24.810
I told him about Nick Parks and all
the events leading up to our arrest.

36:27.451 --> 36:29.203
I signed a statement...

36:29.411 --> 36:33.165
...assuming it was just a translation
of what I said.

36:33.411 --> 36:37.882
But these aren't my words.
I never said any of that.

36:38.091 --> 36:40.651
That's the truth.

36:56.251 --> 36:58.048
[SPEAKS IN THAl]

37:06.211 --> 37:09.283
- What happened?
- Don't worry, we'll appeal.

37:09.491 --> 37:13.450
You can request a pardon.
He found you both guilty.

37:13.651 --> 37:16.324
- For how long?
- Good news. It wasn't life.

37:16.531 --> 37:18.806
You both got numbered sentences.

37:19.731 --> 37:22.165
- For how long?
- 33 years.

37:22.491 --> 37:26.120
- Daddy!
- Honey, I'll take care of everything.

37:30.571 --> 37:32.721
Yes, we're all over it.

37:32.931 --> 37:34.967
Listen, I gotta go.

37:35.771 --> 37:38.331
Sorry about that. Couldn't be helped.

37:38.611 --> 37:41.967
- I know how you must feel.
- Fellas, look...

37:42.251 --> 37:45.004
I know what goes on around here.

37:45.251 --> 37:47.367
They take drugs seriously.

37:47.651 --> 37:49.926
- There's no doubt...
- Come on.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.605
Nobody here really wants
to stop the drugs. They're all...

37:57.331 --> 38:02.325
I don't care if Thailand drowns
in heroin. That's their business.

38:02.971 --> 38:06.168
Your business is to help
American citizens.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.600
She didn't do anything.

38:09.811 --> 38:13.645
They're not gonna make
an example of my little girl...

38:13.851 --> 38:15.842
...with some trumped-up charge.

38:16.051 --> 38:18.360
You pull strings all the time.

38:18.571 --> 38:22.246
You could pull them for my daughter.

38:23.811 --> 38:27.360
The DEA will continue
our investigation.

38:27.571 --> 38:32.361
If we find the alleged man
who lured your daughter into this...

38:32.571 --> 38:35.768
...we'll certainly
introduce that in an appeal.

38:37.931 --> 38:40.604
I know this is difficult for you.

38:40.811 --> 38:44.406
But the best thing
you can do is go home.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.604
Go back to your family.

38:48.331 --> 38:52.483
Nothing will fall through the cracks.
We'll keep you informed.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.767
That's a promise.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.883
ALICE:
So here we are.

39:00.091 --> 39:02.889
Just two more drug smugglers.

39:03.451 --> 39:06.727
I don 't even know why
I'm making this tape.

39:27.971 --> 39:29.529
How do you do?

39:29.971 --> 39:31.404
I'm Henry Greene.

39:32.211 --> 39:34.042
Hank Greene, actually.

39:34.251 --> 39:36.287
- Who are you?
- Yankee Hank?

39:36.491 --> 39:41.042
Yankee Hank, or Hank the Yank,
or whatever.

39:41.251 --> 39:45.529
What can I do for you?
You want a cigarette?

39:45.731 --> 39:49.804
- So you're like a lawyer?
- No, I am a lawyer.

39:51.131 --> 39:53.929
Is this pro bono work that you do?

39:54.131 --> 39:57.009
Pro bono? No.

39:57.531 --> 40:00.568
So I listened to your narrative.

40:02.571 --> 40:06.325
Forgive me if I'm blunt,
but there's nothing there.

40:06.531 --> 40:11.207
You just claim you didn't know
about the smack. If you're lying...

40:11.491 --> 40:15.723
...you're brainy and stupid.
If it's true, you're just stupid.

40:15.931 --> 40:18.684
So I gotta ask a few questions.

40:18.931 --> 40:22.970
Who was carrying
the luggage with the drugs?

40:23.171 --> 40:24.763
I was.

40:25.611 --> 40:30.526
You had a couple kilos of heroin.
You didn't notice the extra weight?

40:30.731 --> 40:34.007
- I didn't. I just didn't.
- We were late.

40:34.211 --> 40:35.690
Yeah, of course.

40:36.051 --> 40:38.770
- Who packed the bag?
- I did.

40:42.371 --> 40:45.124
Alice, what does your father do?

40:45.371 --> 40:46.963
Works at Bekins.

40:47.171 --> 40:50.846
- Does he run a branch office?
- He rents trucks.

40:51.731 --> 40:53.449
And your mom?

40:54.131 --> 40:56.440
She died when I was 7.

40:56.651 --> 40:59.165
Sorry to hear that.
What happened?

40:59.411 --> 41:01.163
Car accident.

41:02.651 --> 41:04.721
- And your dad?
- Insurance.

41:05.331 --> 41:08.607
And my mom sells real estate.
Part-time.

41:10.571 --> 41:13.449
I'll call to see
if they'll contribute...

41:13.691 --> 41:16.285
...to their daughters' liberation
fund.

41:16.531 --> 41:19.364
- What are you gonna do?
- Get you out.

41:19.571 --> 41:22.802
Start writing letters
to lawmakers back home.

41:23.611 --> 41:27.286
Congressmen. The president.
If you know a priest.

41:27.531 --> 41:30.204
You want me to write
to my congressman?

41:30.411 --> 41:33.369
That's right. I'll be in touch, girls.

41:37.531 --> 41:40.204
- He's totally sleazy.
- Don't say that.

41:40.451 --> 41:43.170
Greene? You say you're Thai?

41:43.371 --> 41:45.009
HANK:
Well, I might as well be.

41:45.331 --> 41:48.562
I'm American, but I know
their justice system.

41:49.011 --> 41:51.571
- Now there's an oxymoron.
- Yeah.

41:52.531 --> 41:56.524
My wife, Yon,
is also a practicing attorney...

41:56.771 --> 41:58.204
...born in Bangkok.

41:58.451 --> 42:03.241
We've helped a lot of families.
We could help your daughter.

42:03.691 --> 42:05.568
What do you want out of this?

42:06.051 --> 42:08.246
I'm just a broker.

42:09.771 --> 42:12.285
We're looking for our usual retainer.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.721
Which is...

42:14.931 --> 42:16.444
...$ 15,000.

42:17.211 --> 42:18.485
$ 15,000?

42:19.771 --> 42:23.923
7500 to try to get a hearing
and 7500 if we do.

42:24.131 --> 42:27.043
That's for both girls.

42:27.571 --> 42:29.482
Wait, for both girls?

42:29.811 --> 42:34.282
- Darlene needs her own trial.
- You don't want to do that.

42:34.491 --> 42:38.803
The strongest point is
that Alice didn't sign a confession.

42:39.411 --> 42:44.565
Separate them, and you're begging
for Darlene to be singled out.

42:47.251 --> 42:50.288
Do you wanna take a day or two?

42:50.491 --> 42:52.209
No. God, no.

42:53.451 --> 42:54.884
I'll get the money.

42:55.131 --> 42:58.009
I'll call Marano
and wire it to you.

42:58.211 --> 43:01.169
Great. We'll be in touch.

43:21.771 --> 43:23.807
Who got you these tickets?

43:24.051 --> 43:27.088
Same guy who introduced me
to these babies.

43:27.291 --> 43:30.089
Well, hello there. Thank you.

43:31.531 --> 43:33.647
Our next Minister of Justice.

43:33.931 --> 43:35.887
He's worked hard for it.

43:36.091 --> 43:38.651
He's working his fingers to the bone.

43:42.011 --> 43:45.242
I love that guy!
I love that guy, man!

43:45.451 --> 43:46.566
This is great.

43:46.771 --> 43:48.727
No problem.

43:48.931 --> 43:52.367
So when do I get the file
on Davis and Marano?

43:54.171 --> 43:57.925
Those girls have no chance
of getting out of there.

43:58.131 --> 43:59.610
Who's Nick Parks?

44:00.211 --> 44:01.121
Who?

44:01.731 --> 44:04.199
Why couldn't you find him?

44:05.371 --> 44:08.169
The cops say the girls made him up.

44:08.371 --> 44:10.965
Even if he did plant the six kilos...

44:11.171 --> 44:13.890
...you know he'd never confess.

44:14.211 --> 44:15.360
- Six?
- Yeah.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.920
The shit was in their backpacks.

44:18.611 --> 44:23.526
As far as the Thais are concerned,
they're guilty. Guilty or not.

44:23.731 --> 44:25.722
Take a pass on this one.

44:27.451 --> 44:29.919
After you give me the file, Roy.

44:37.331 --> 44:40.687
Why not find out
who bought the plane tickets?

44:41.011 --> 44:45.368
You'd think that'd be the easiest way
to catch this guy.

44:45.571 --> 44:47.562
If he exists.

44:48.651 --> 44:50.687
He sure doesn't exist in this.

44:50.931 --> 44:52.762
What do you believe?

44:53.811 --> 44:56.166
I believe that, either way...

44:56.371 --> 44:59.408
...we'll be able to afford a new car.

Look at that, they're so arrogant,
they don't try to finesse it.

45:07.251 --> 45:10.448
All that narcotic
in that little backpack.

45:11.651 --> 45:13.130
I don't think so.

45:18.451 --> 45:23.241
- That's great.
- It's just a hearing for a retrial.

45:23.451 --> 45:27.046
I also talked to
the lady who runs the hotel.

45:27.251 --> 45:31.563
Either she's not involved
or she's the best liar I've met.

45:31.771 --> 45:33.523
What about Nick?

45:34.411 --> 45:36.561
Parks isn't the magic bullet.

45:36.771 --> 45:40.480
Even if we do find him,
it's your word against his.

45:40.931 --> 45:42.967
But we're still looking.

45:44.651 --> 45:47.563

45:48.451 --> 45:49.884
Sure.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.248
Nick was staying at
the Queen Victoria?

46:03.491 --> 46:06.130
My wife found a maid there...

46:06.331 --> 46:11.200
...who said there was a young man
there who matched Parks' description.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.164
So, good, right?

46:14.651 --> 46:17.165
The maid remembered him with a girl.

46:17.371 --> 46:19.282
But when showed this picture...

46:19.491 --> 46:23.769
...guess who the maid picked out
as the girl he was with.

46:25.851 --> 46:27.250
Me.

46:28.451 --> 46:31.011
Okay, I was at Nick's hotel.

46:31.291 --> 46:35.125
And he came on to me,
but I told him to forget it.

46:36.051 --> 46:39.407
He never even mentioned drugs.
I swear it.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.567
- Is there anything else I should know?
- No.

46:46.051 --> 46:50.442

That would be really weird.

46:51.971 --> 46:55.008
- I see no reason to tell anyone.
- Thank you.

Now I have a favor to ask you.

46:58.931 --> 47:01.365

- What you'd do with a million bucks?
- Well, yeah, he did ask me that.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.447
He asked me something
about that, but I never knew.

I'm the mastermind.

thinks. I know I didn't do it.

Of course you did. Why not?

And then you gave me a bracelet?
Was that a consolation prize?

What did he say?
"Oh, Darlene's a sweet girl, but..."

01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:57.650

"Darlene's a really sweet girl...

01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:03.802
Don't lie to a lifer.

01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:07.526
We heard you couldn't
have anything in here...

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.002
...but we got you each a bra.

01:05:10.211 --> 01:05:12.771
A little push-up in the padding.

01:05:15.171 --> 01:05:18.766
- Alice?
- Great.

01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.249
So you guys still
hanging out together?

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:25.807
No, we see Mary
at Christmas, spring break.

01:05:26.011 --> 01:05:29.765
You're at college?
Do you like it?

01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:33.964
It's just State.
I have this moronic roommate.

01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:37.163
I mean, the girl sleeps in her socks.

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:39.327
It's different than high school.

01:05:39.611 --> 01:05:42.683
That's good. That's really good.

01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:46.361
I saw your sister in the mall.
She's so big.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:50.771
You guys look so good.

01:05:50.971 --> 01:05:53.565
WOMAN:
Attention! Visiting hours are over.

01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:56.205
All visitors must leave.

01:05:56.531 --> 01:05:58.044
Darlene!

01:05:58.411 --> 01:06:00.800
At least you're together.

01:06:01.051 --> 01:06:03.645
At least you have each other, right?

01:06:56.931 --> 01:07:01.004
Whatever she's on, I want some.

01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:28.407
Darlene! Darlene!

01:07:50.851 --> 01:07:53.081
She stay in infirmary.

01:07:53.251 --> 01:07:57.130
They find cockroach.
It crawled in Darlene's ear.

01:07:57.331 --> 01:08:01.927
It caused infection.
The doctor pulled it out from ear.

01:08:40.331 --> 01:08:41.844
Can I make a wish?

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:47.606
Spirit house is not for wish.
Spirit house not joke.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:57.326
Can I talk to the guard
who forgot to lock the gate?

01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:00.568
- Help me.
- Do you want to die?

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.490
Velie, I've got money.

01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:24.083
Leave me alone.

01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:33.040
- Can I just talk to you?
- No.

01:10:36.451 --> 01:10:39.284
The night I gave you the bracelet...

01:10:40.891 --> 01:10:43.485
...I was with Nick that day.

01:10:44.011 --> 01:10:47.367
And he kissed me.
We didn't do anything else.

01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:50.039
He tried, but I wouldn't let him.

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:55.289
I should've told you he was a creep.

01:10:57.051 --> 01:11:00.043
What if we had
just gone to Hawaii?

01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:05.166
What if I let you buy those drinks?
What if I told you about Nick?

01:11:05.371 --> 01:11:09.080
- There'd be no Hong Kong...
- And we wouldn't be here.

01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:20.766
We won't be here much longer.
I set it up. We're getting out.

01:11:44.811 --> 01:11:47.086
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:13:59.651 --> 01:14:01.881
Where's the goddamn car?

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:27.681
I couldn't sleep.
The coffee's fresh.

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:32.962
"Customs was told Davis and Marano
carried narcotics...

01:15:33.171 --> 01:15:36.527
...by an anonymous informant's
phone call.

01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:40.480
Identification of the caller
was unsuccessful."

01:15:41.851 --> 01:15:44.888
They tape those calls, don't they?

01:15:46.131 --> 01:15:47.689
Do they?

01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:50.729
I don't know.

01:15:59.611 --> 01:16:01.567
Bud, check this out.

01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:07.482
- Just had it installed.
- U.S. Tax dollars are hard at work.

01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:12.321
- Hey, it's a living. Drink?
- I don't think so.

01:16:12.531 --> 01:16:13.566
What's up?

01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:16.888
Have you got a line
on a Skip K. Carn?

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:19.279
Why?

01:16:25.011 --> 01:16:28.686
See? The letters, just rearranged.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.481
It's an anagram. What's it prove?

01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:36.082
- I think you know all about him.
- I do?

01:16:36.451 --> 01:16:41.002
This is a recording from the
anonymous informant who called customs.

01:16:41.211 --> 01:16:44.999
A young man
with a heavy Australian accent.

01:16:45.211 --> 01:16:48.328
- It's Skip Carn. I'm sure.
- Prove it.

01:16:48.531 --> 01:16:51.841
It could be anyone
with an Aussie accent.

01:16:52.051 --> 01:16:54.690
Those girls didn't stand a chance.

01:16:54.891 --> 01:16:57.610
This scumbag bought eight tickets.

01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:00.166
His real couriers sailed by.

01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:04.284
But your girls were
still carrying the smack.

01:17:04.491 --> 01:17:09.406
Goddamn it, Roy!
They're gonna die in that shithole.

01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:23.367
All I know about Skip Carn
is he's a low-level hustler.

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:27.166
A bottom-feeder with friends
in high places.

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:29.283
And that's it?

01:17:32.211 --> 01:17:33.610
One friend...

01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:36.686
...in a really high place.

01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:52.559
So he had to give up two mules...

01:17:52.771 --> 01:17:55.763
...to cover for six other mules
on the flight.

01:17:56.011 --> 01:18:00.687
Could you stop saying that word?
We're not mules.

01:18:01.091 --> 01:18:03.764
Yes. Nick Parks tipped off customs...

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.087
...to create a diversion.

01:18:06.331 --> 01:18:10.643
They were too busy with you
to search the six other couriers.

01:18:11.611 --> 01:18:14.887
It's insurance for
this kind of people.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:19.884
The cops and customs guys
get paid extra money...

01:18:20.131 --> 01:18:22.691
...when they make a dope bust?

01:18:23.691 --> 01:18:26.080
So we were like a walking bribe.

01:18:27.131 --> 01:18:28.086
Yes.

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:32.443
Now they'll add 15 more years
for trying to escape.

01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:45.089
You have been busy, Mr. Greene.

01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:49.086
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:54.206
Getting those two girls set free
has earned you a few shekels?

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.483
A few.

01:18:56.851 --> 01:19:00.810
I believe I'm really the source
of your good fortune.

01:19:01.931 --> 01:19:03.410
How's that, sir?

01:19:03.611 --> 01:19:07.047
I catch drug smugglers,
and you defend them.

01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:11.085
I feel I'm owed some sort of
tribute from you.

01:19:11.411 --> 01:19:14.050
It's a regular food chain.

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:17.243
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:21.410
I guess Skip Carn would know
a thing or two...

01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:24.171
...about paying tribute to you.

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:28.851
I expect a little more from you.

01:19:29.051 --> 01:19:33.363
You're acting like...
What's that American expression?

01:19:33.571 --> 01:19:35.687
An ambulance chaser.

01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:41.206
I'm kind of a loose cannon.
Know that American expression?

01:19:41.411 --> 01:19:44.687
I'd love to blow this
out of the water.

01:19:44.891 --> 01:19:49.601
You have a cozy relationship
with a known drug trafficker.

01:19:49.811 --> 01:19:52.962
This is exactly the kind of thing...

01:19:53.171 --> 01:19:55.969
...Americans love watching on TV.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:20:01.081
Two American girls' lives ruined
by a sleazy smuggler...

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:04.283
...and the greedy cop in his pocket.

01:20:04.531 --> 01:20:09.446
You'll have to get ready for
Larry King. You'll love him.

01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:13.803
Barbara Walters will probably
have pictures of you.

01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:18.289
Barbara and the parents
will go into the bedroom:

01:20:18.491 --> 01:20:22.928
"This is Darlene's room,
exactly as she left it."

01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:26.885
- Teddy bears...
- Is there a point to this fantasy?

01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:30.686
Yes, sir, it's a simple point.

01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:33.088
I need your help.

01:20:42.731 --> 01:20:44.722
That's a good accent.

01:20:44.931 --> 01:20:49.083
My Spanish teacher always told me,
"Good ear, bad memory."

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:54.079
- How's Darlene doing?
- She's better.

01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:59.968
- We'll just wait for her.
- Can I ask you something?

01:21:00.251 --> 01:21:03.641
Since there's no money left,
why are you here?

01:21:04.451 --> 01:21:08.490
No matter how I look at it,
you don't deserve this.

01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:14.483
- Even if I did it?
- Yeah, but...

01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:18.681
You didn't do it.
We both know it.

01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:34.882
I wanted you to hear this
at the same time.

01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:37.681
You're gonna get to go home.

01:21:39.851 --> 01:21:43.764
- How?
- You'll have to sign a statement.

01:21:43.971 --> 01:21:46.690
Admit you're wrong. Forget Nick...

01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:49.764
- A statement?
- I can't do that.

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:53.850
This is the official,
face-saving confession.

01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:57.839
You corroborate the police
version of events.

01:21:58.051 --> 01:22:00.406
That's our part of the deal.

01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:04.802
Then the crown will pardon you.

01:22:05.011 --> 01:22:06.888
Then you get to go home.

01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:56.884
All right.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.489
It's okay.

01:24:01.011 --> 01:24:03.889
No pardon: Narcotic offender.

01:24:04.131 --> 01:24:07.123
- What's the problem?
- No pardon.

01:24:07.331 --> 01:24:10.607
Your Minister of Justice has agreed.

01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:14.201
You tell him that we have
an agreement.

01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:19.041
I'm sorry.
They are narcotics smugglers.

01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:22.129
You son of a bitch, we have a deal.

01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:26.119
Yes, nicely done.
You really had me going.

01:24:26.331 --> 01:24:29.528
But now there is no more Skip Carn.

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.609
No one will get to him, so no deal.

01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:38.685
Wait.

01:24:42.571 --> 01:24:44.482
No, get them off me.

01:25:11.931 --> 01:25:14.081
You may speak English.

01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:19.962
My best friend is not a drug smuggler.
She is innocent.

01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:22.044
She's innocent.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:25.288
All she ever did wrong
was to trust me.

01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:32.127
Here you believe one friend
knows what the other does.

01:25:32.331 --> 01:25:34.003
Maybe that's friendship...

01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:38.568
...but I'm American, and I was not
that kind of a friend.

01:25:38.771 --> 01:25:40.682
I know this.

01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:46.167
Because I did it.
Because I was foolish...

01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:51.604
...and jealous.
I was afraid she'd drift away.

01:25:51.811 --> 01:25:54.883
I was afraid I was gonna lose her.

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:58.765
She never knew. It was all me.

01:25:58.971 --> 01:26:03.283
She spent all this time
in your prison for my mistakes.

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.282
I'm sorry.

01:26:07.451 --> 01:26:11.603
Please, if you need someone
to do the time, I'll do it.

01:26:11.851 --> 01:26:16.083
I'll do her time and mine.
Just let her go, please.

01:26:27.131 --> 01:26:32.046
Then you're of strong character
and would lie to save your friend?

01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:35.884
No, I am of weak character.

01:26:36.131 --> 01:26:39.487
And I just want to
make up for my mistakes.

01:26:39.731 --> 01:26:42.882
If you're lying to
save your friend...

01:26:43.371 --> 01:26:47.444
...then you're of sufficient character
to earn what you want.

01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:50.845
If you're telling the truth...

01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:55.329
...then your friend is innocent
and should go free.

01:26:55.531 --> 01:26:59.683
If you are willing to serve
her term and yours...

01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:02.286
...your friend is pardoned.

01:27:07.811 --> 01:27:10.279
Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:43.531 --> 01:27:46.091
Darlene must go soon.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:05.286
You're a very good liar.

01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:08.128
You didn't do it.

01:28:09.331 --> 01:28:11.481
I know you didn't do it.

01:28:12.611 --> 01:28:14.647
I don't think I can leave you.

01:28:18.091 --> 01:28:20.480
If I say it was the truth...

01:28:20.891 --> 01:28:24.327
...you'll hate me.
And if I say I lied...

01:28:24.531 --> 01:28:29.685
...then when you go home,
all the time with your family...

01:28:29.891 --> 01:28:32.689
You won't be able to just be happy.

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:38.000
So let's just say it was
the right thing to do.

01:28:42.731 --> 01:28:45.086
Let's just leave it at that.

01:28:55.691 --> 01:28:56.840
Come, Darlene.

01:29:07.611 --> 01:29:11.081
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- I know.

01:29:14.651 --> 01:29:18.485
Go, Dar. I need you to.

01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:21.483
Please.

01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:57.208
ALICE: A lot of people won 't
understand why I said I did it.

01:30:57.411 --> 01:31:00.483
But for me, it was
the right thing to do.

01:31:01.251 --> 01:31:04.687
Maybe more right than
anything I ever did.

01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:09.288
Darlene and Hank won 't stop trying...

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.087
...till I'm out of here.

01:31:13.251 --> 01:31:14.889
Until I'm free.
