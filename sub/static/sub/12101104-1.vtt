25:46.505 --> 25:48.591
Where are you!

25:49.008 --> 25:51.719
[Cyan]
Follow my voice.

You're getting warmer.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.046
[Emma]
Cyan!

26:29.340 --> 26:33.010
[Cyan]
Keeping walking Emma

26:37.723 --> 26:41.685
[Cyan]
You're almost there.

26:43.562 --> 26:47.733
[Cyan]
I'm waiting for you.

26:54.615 --> 26:59.912
[Radio static]

27:00.663 --> 27:04.375
[Cyan]

[Rumbling]

27:30.484 --> 27:36.824
[Radio static]

27:39.702 --> 27:42.096
[Emma] I heard her
calling me into the darkness

27:42.129 --> 27:44.349
and I followed her
voice through the night,

27:44.415 --> 27:49.145
until I was afraid to go any further...
something didn’t feel right.

27:49.211 --> 27:51.505
I lost Cyan that night.

27:57.386 --> 28:01.074
[Emma]
My Grandma continues on where
my Grandfather left off,

28:01.140 --> 28:04.536
trying to find out about the lemurians.

28:04.602 --> 28:08.998
She has been researching cases
around Mount Shasta.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.008
Most of the evidence
is photographs of light

28:11.041 --> 28:12.794
patterns near the peak of Mount Shasta.

28:12.860 --> 28:20.860
[Slide projector clicking]

[Film projector running]

28:41.597 --> 28:49.597
[Emma]
A hunter captured this video near
the base of Shasta.

28:58.697 --> 29:03.953
[Emma]
This one was recorded in McCloud.

29:18.717 --> 29:24.431
[Emma]
Recently she got a phone video
from a family gathering near
Mount Shasta.

29:35.234 --> 29:39.672
[Emma]
My Grandma believes the energy
around Shasta is growing stronger.

29:39.738 --> 29:43.968
[Emma]
She believes the energy can
cause mental disturbance.

29:44.034 --> 29:48.806
She believes the lemurians have
taken my Grandpa and my brother.

29:48.872 --> 29:53.919
She thinks they are somewhere
deep inside Mount Shasta.

29:54.837 --> 29:59.091
[Wind]

30:00.843 --> 30:05.156
My brother and Grandfather
weren't the only ones who
disappeared.

30:05.222 --> 30:09.143
Three other people vanished
near mount Shasta.

30:22.197 --> 30:27.053
She believes a pattern of
disappearance started in 1983.

30:27.119 --> 30:31.540
Five people disappeared around
Weed California.

30:34.418 --> 30:41.091
Eleven years later in 1994 five
people disappeared in Mount Shasta.

30:46.263 --> 30:52.227
In 2005 five more people
disappeared in McCloud.

30:54.396 --> 30:59.735
2016 five more people disappeared
including my brother and Grandpa.

31:00.152 --> 31:07.510
Sage Martin, Alex Hayden, Logan Douglas,
Jack Widmer and Quinn Rose.

31:07.576 --> 31:13.057
Every eleven years five people would
vanish without a trace around Mount
Shasta.

31:13.123 --> 31:17.937
My Grandma believed the lemurians
were abducting people every eleven
years.

31:18.003 --> 31:22.567
A portal was created by the lemurians
to allow the chosen ones to enter.

31:22.633 --> 31:26.863
Grandma said my Grandpa and brother
are somewhere inside the mountain.

31:26.929 --> 31:29.873
That somehow they must
have entered the portal

31:29.906 --> 31:32.559
and the lemurians are holding them there.

31:37.189 --> 31:42.319
The first to go missing was a young
boy named Sage Martin.

35:19.703 --> 35:22.102
A young boy named
Logan Douglas went missing

35:22.135 --> 35:24.291
during a vacation trip with his family.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.836
[Logan]

My Grandfather disappeared
doing what he liked to do best.

36:43.537 --> 36:47.058
My grandfather disappeared doing
what he liked to do best.

36:47.124 --> 36:49.501
Searching for the lost city of Telos.

36:51.002 --> 36:51.897
[Static]

36:51.963 --> 36:54.089
[Grandpa]
Talking about a great find.

36:54.297 --> 36:56.508
Wow, look at this beauty.

36:56.842 --> 36:59.803
You're looking at a lemurian crystal.

37:01.930 --> 37:06.309
There's a strange sound around
here, a very strange sound.

37:08.311 --> 37:09.246
[Static]

37:09.312 --> 37:13.692
Oh wow! We have more company,
there's two up there now

37:13.775 --> 37:16.361
[Rumbling]

37:16.445 --> 37:18.339
I wish you could be here with me Barbara.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.365
I hope you can see this.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.202
And look over there, another one.

37:24.745 --> 37:32.745
[Rumbling]

37:41.470 --> 37:45.182
The third one is moving.

37:46.641 --> 37:49.686
I can feel the light on me, it's
so amazing.

37:51.813 --> 37:54.125
I can't tell what direction
they are moving.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.568

[TV Narrator]
Some people have encountered the
luminaries up close.

38:39.903 --> 38:43.652
Back in 1994, Manuel Rose
was interviewed by a local

38:43.685 --> 38:47.903
television station about his
experience near Mount Shasta.

38:48.495 --> 38:54.643
What you are about to hear is
an actual video recording by
Manuel Rose.

38:54.709 --> 39:02.709
This eerie sound has been reported
by many locals at Mount Shasta
around dusk.

39:04.427 --> 39:08.251
The sound is usually
described as a low frequency

39:08.284 --> 39:11.827
sound and only lasts
for a couple of minutes.

39:11.893 --> 39:14.901
On day two, the Rose family
witnessed something strange,

39:14.934 --> 39:17.541
a pattern of lights hovering
above Mount Shasta.

39:17.607 --> 39:22.988
Luckily Manuel Rose took his 8mm
camera and captured that moment.

39:23.113 --> 39:29.244
Just as quickly the lights appeared
they vanished moving in opposite
directions.

39:39.296 --> 39:42.458
The rose family is native
to the Shasta area and have

39:42.491 --> 39:45.927
been vacationing near mount
Shasta for the last 10 years.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.865
1983 would be their last vacation
together.

39:49.931 --> 39:53.234
Manuel Rose's son 13
year old James Rose went

39:53.267 --> 39:56.455
missing on the third
day of their vacation.

39:56.521 --> 40:00.114
While hiking near the base of Mount Shasta

40:00.147 --> 40:03.945
Manuel and James lost
touch with each other.

40:04.112 --> 40:08.408
It was the last time anyone saw
young James again.

40:09.367 --> 40:13.622
Police and rangers scoured the
forest looking for James.

40:15.999 --> 40:19.061
Manuel Rose describes to a television
crew in 1994

40:19.127 --> 40:23.298
about a young woman who approached
deep in the woods while looking for
his son.

40:23.632 --> 40:27.177
The woman was described as out
of place, looking angelic.

40:27.385 --> 40:31.156
A local sketch artist created an
image of the mysterious woman.

40:31.222 --> 40:36.912
Some people believe Manuel
crossed paths with a lemunian being.

40:36.978 --> 40:40.347
One from nearby
towns reported recognizing

40:40.380 --> 40:43.318
this person to be from the local area.

40:43.443 --> 40:46.696
What do you believe?

41:05.840 --> 41:09.052
[Electric shock]

41:43.878 --> 41:45.981
[Grandma]
Oh God, where did you get this?

41:46.047 --> 41:47.841
[Emma]
I don't know.

41:48.633 --> 41:50.135
[Grandma]
This is important.

41:55.473 --> 41:56.474
[Grandma]
Come here.

41:59.978 --> 42:03.248
[Emma]
My Grandma knew I had a powerful
gift when she saw the watch.

42:03.314 --> 42:06.961
My Grandpa wore that watch on the
day he disappeared.

42:07.027 --> 42:10.375
I told my Grandma everything
about my dreams and all the things

42:10.408 --> 42:13.467
I was able to pull through
during my astral travel trips.

42:13.533 --> 42:16.941
I was able to grab onto
something from the past.

42:16.974 --> 42:20.057
A toy tire, a coin,
but this was different.

42:20.123 --> 42:24.034
I told grandma everything
She told me I have a gift, not

42:24.067 --> 42:27.940
a gift to astral travel but
astral travel back in time.

42:28.006 --> 42:32.427
I can't change the past, but i have the
ability to bring something back.

42:34.137 --> 42:36.723
Grandma knew a psychic from the area.
.

42:39.017 --> 42:44.623
[Grandma]
Hi, hey. I need to bring my
granddaughter in to get a reading.

42:44.689 --> 42:48.182
[Emma] Grandma knew a psychic
from the area who might be able to

42:48.215 --> 42:51.797
help me understand more about
my gifts so she took me to see her.

42:51.863 --> 42:54.758
I was nervous but willing to try anything.

42:54.824 --> 42:58.953
[Grandma]
I appreciate it so much. Thank you,
thank you.

43:05.251 --> 43:07.187
[Clock ticking]

43:07.253 --> 43:09.798
[Psychic]
Okay, let's begin.

43:10.715 --> 43:14.817
I want you to close your
eyes, take a few deep

43:14.850 --> 43:18.715
breaths and focus on
the sound of my voice.

43:25.438 --> 43:29.192
Push your thoughts out of your mind.

43:30.235 --> 43:33.935
As you feel them drift further and further

43:33.968 --> 43:38.235
away, you find yourself
floating in nothingness.

43:41.454 --> 43:49.454
While you’re in this space, allow your
mind to focus on what you most
desire to know.

43:57.053 --> 44:00.014
What are you searching for Emma?

44:01.349 --> 44:05.019
What are you yearning to uncover?

44:05.603 --> 44:13.603
Keep focusing on that feeling
and allow it to grow stronger.

45:17.884 --> 45:23.031
You may open your eyes now.

45:23.097 --> 45:29.580
Traditionally, the Star Card represents
inspiration,

45:29.646 --> 45:37.646
renewed hope and a possibility for
rebirth after great struggle, change
and chaos.

45:38.655 --> 45:43.886
For you, I sense that there is a
second meaning.

45:43.952 --> 45:51.952
There is a messenger, a presenter of
sorts, she is searching for you.

45:53.169 --> 45:56.749
She brings something wrapped in light that

45:56.782 --> 46:01.169
unfortunately reveals
within it undesirable truths.

46:08.101 --> 46:16.001
She is a beautiful spirit who is
surrounded in darkness.

46:16.067 --> 46:19.004
She walks through the shadows

46:19.070 --> 46:23.675
She is cosmic and wise.

46:23.741 --> 46:27.447
She has been making
her way to you for many

46:27.480 --> 46:31.741
years now and comes to
you with outstretched arms

46:36.212 --> 46:43.028
She beckons you forward towards
your destiny.

46:43.094 --> 46:47.061
While she doesn’t mean
to cause you any harm, the

46:47.094 --> 46:51.094
truths she reveals bring
great emotional turmoil.

46:54.147 --> 46:59.962
I want you to know that you have
the ability to move through this.

47:00.028 --> 47:05.968
The pain and hardships that will
arise from this difficult encounter

47:06.034 --> 47:14.034
act like a beacon of light
illuminating the path that
stretches out before you.

47:14.667 --> 47:22.667
Even though the truth may hurt,
whatever she reveals to you
has great purpose.

47:22.925 --> 47:30.200
I want you to remember that you
have what it takes to navigate through
this.

47:30.266 --> 47:33.870
You have all you need to triumph.

47:33.936 --> 47:35.956
[Emma]
Her friend pulled a card for me.

47:36.022 --> 47:39.918
The card revealed that I indeed had
a spirit guide that was trying to
help me

47:39.984 --> 47:43.463
and it was up to me to understand
what she was trying to show me.

47:43.529 --> 47:46.466
My Grandma felt that, when I was
astral traveling,

47:46.532 --> 47:51.013
that I was going through the portal that
all the missing people disappeared through,

47:51.079 --> 47:54.496
because I was able to
bring back an object that

47:54.529 --> 47:57.686
was with my Grandpa
the day he disappeared,

47:57.752 --> 48:00.499
that maybe I would be able
to retrieve items from my

48:00.532 --> 48:03.525
brother and the other three
people who had gone missing,

48:03.591 --> 48:06.570
and prove to the world that anything
is possible.

48:06.636 --> 48:09.573
This was something she could show
to the skeptics.

48:09.639 --> 48:12.659
I had to prepare myself for the ultimate
trip.

48:12.725 --> 48:16.204
I had to prepare myself for what’s
behind the wall of time.

48:16.270 --> 48:22.235
My brother was waiting for me.
I was ready.

48:23.111 --> 48:26.757

was Sage Martin.

48:48.469 --> 48:51.472
[Grandma]
You're safe now.

48:51.806 --> 48:56.745
I want you to focus only on my voice.

48:56.811 --> 49:00.624
You are a traveler.

49:00.690 --> 49:05.796
You're now free from this world.

49:05.862 --> 49:11.534
Free from everything.

51:22.226 --> 51:25.477
something, and now I was
ready to go even further.

51:25.543 --> 51:28.546
It was time to get my brother.

51:38.472 --> 51:42.744
[Grandma]
You're safe now.

51:42.810 --> 51:46.957
I want you to focus only on my voice.

51:50.109 --> 51:53.713
You're now free from this world.

51:53.779 --> 51:58.009
Free from everything.

51:58.075 --> 52:04.182
It's now June 4th, 2017

52:04.248 --> 52:08.770
The time is 10:20 pm.

52:08.836 --> 52:12.607
You're ten years old.

52:12.673 --> 52:16.027
You're at that moment.

52:16.093 --> 52:19.531
Safe at home.

52:19.597 --> 52:22.993
You hear your brother's voice.

52:23.059 --> 52:26.687
What do you see?

52:27.605 --> 52:29.874
[Quinn]
Where are you?

52:29.940 --> 52:36.590
[Emma laughing]

52:36.656 --> 52:39.259
[Emma]
I scared you.

52:39.325 --> 52:42.220
[Quinn]
No, go to sleep Emma.

52:42.286 --> 52:44.598
[Emma]
Hey, I didn't finish the story.

52:44.664 --> 52:48.685
[Quinn]
Mom is going to get mad.

52:48.751 --> 52:52.188
[Quinn]
Go to bed Emma.

52:52.254 --> 52:59.095
[Mom]
You two go to bed. You guys
have school tomorrow.

53:03.182 --> 53:05.535
[Quinn]
Did you hear me?

53:05.601 --> 53:09.664
[Emma]
The door slowly opens.

53:09.730 --> 53:12.834
[Door click]

53:12.900 --> 53:20.491
[Door creaks]

53:30.126 --> 53:33.563
[Emma]
Quinn!

53:33.629 --> 53:39.027
[Rumbling]

53:39.093 --> 53:43.264
[Electric static]

53:50.312 --> 53:53.708
[Emma]
He's here!

53:53.774 --> 53:56.252
[Grandma]
Who's here?

53:56.318 --> 53:58.880
[Emma]
Quinn!

53:58.946 --> 54:01.866
[Emma]
Quinn where are you?

54:04.994 --> 54:07.222
[Emma]
Quinn come out.

54:07.288 --> 54:09.265
[Grandma]
Emma, he didn't come through.

54:09.331 --> 54:10.392
[Emma]
Yeah he did, I saw him

54:10.458 --> 54:11.393
[Grandma]
He's not here.

54:11.459 --> 54:12.435
[Emma]
He is here.

54:12.501 --> 54:14.378
[Door knocking]

54:14.920 --> 54:16.130
[Emma]
He's here!

54:21.469 --> 54:22.779
[Emma]
Quinn!

54:22.845 --> 54:23.845
[Grandma]
Oh my God!

54:25.347 --> 54:27.558
[Grandma]
You're safe, you're safe Quinn.

54:28.392 --> 54:30.829
[Grandma]
Don't move!

54:30.895 --> 54:33.164
[Grandma]
Wait Emma, don't touch him.

54:33.230 --> 54:35.441
[Emma]
It's okay Quinn.

54:36.317 --> 54:38.980
[Emma] I knew I was
able to bring my brother

54:39.013 --> 54:41.464
back even though it was hard to believe.

54:41.530 --> 54:45.135
I was seeing him with my own eyes.
He was here.

54:45.201 --> 54:49.723
Grandma was shocked and cautious,
she wouldn’t let me go near him.

54:49.789 --> 54:53.560
She believed Quinn was surrounded
with lemurian energy.

54:53.626 --> 54:56.646
I just stood there. I had no emotions.

54:56.712 --> 55:00.400
There was something not right. Quinn
was different.

55:00.466 --> 55:06.156
He looked older. Something or someone
took the life out of his eyes.

55:06.222 --> 55:09.308
Something just wasn't right.

55:11.060 --> 55:19.060
[Crickets]

55:24.698 --> 55:28.128
[Emma] On the last night I
saw Cyan, she told me the

55:28.161 --> 55:31.890
reason she could see her
was because I was very special.

55:31.956 --> 55:33.927
She said they are preparing people like me

55:33.960 --> 55:36.060
to be ready to help
them when the time came.

55:36.126 --> 55:38.646
To help our planet and the human race
heal.

55:38.712 --> 55:42.437
She told me they’re
more like her, and they too

55:42.470 --> 55:46.387
are preparing others like
me when the time comes.

55:56.313 --> 56:04.313
[Rumbling]

56:04.655 --> 56:12.655
[Cosmic sounds]

56:22.089 --> 56:30.089
[Birds Chirping]

56:52.453 --> 56:55.414
[Emma] Months after my
brother came home, and was

56:55.447 --> 56:58.685
acting more like himself,
he told me about his gifts.

56:58.751 --> 57:02.856
I can not but wonder if he was being
prepared for the time Cyan spoke of.

57:02.922 --> 57:06.776
And if so, we are waiting, we are ready.

57:06.842 --> 57:14.224
[Low rumbling]
