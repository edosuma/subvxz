(Cell Phone Rings)
Hi Mom.

00:03.566 --> 00:05.419
(Car horns and street noises)
The noise?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.819
- TV.
- That's just the TV.

00:07.939 --> 00:10.088
We're watching a DVD.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.818
No, I won't be late.

00:12.939 --> 00:15.993
What? Mom! I'll be fine what um...
(Screaming)

00:16.113 --> 00:19.892
- What do you think is going to happen?
(Girl) - Run!

00:20.012 --> 00:22.425
Mom, um... I'll call you back.

00:22.545 --> 00:24.077
What's going on?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:50.876 --> 00:52.484
Come on.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.704
Ouch. Oh.

01:15.948 --> 01:19.631

==Transcribed by<font color=#00ff00>dcdah</font>==
For www.addic7ed.com

01:48.525 --> 01:52.613
So... I leave you for a
matter of days

01:53.401 --> 01:57.489
and in that time you nearly destroy
the ARC and <i>you</i>

01:57.609 --> 02:01.318
turn out to be either a visitor from the
future or, in fact, and I think this is the

02:01.438 --> 02:04.824
- more likely option, clinically mad.
- The former.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.257
But then I would say that if
I was clinically mad right?

02:08.377 --> 02:10.463
Did you have security checks ***?

02:10.583 --> 02:14.354
Sorry sir the machine that checks whether
people are from the future was out of order.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.353
I'll do the sarcasm...
if you don't mind.

02:17.473 --> 02:21.547
So Philip is in league with Helen
and the machine he's building

02:21.667 --> 02:24.365
is the trigger to the end
of the world.

02:24.485 --> 02:26.996
- In a nutshell.
- I'll talk to the minister

02:27.543 --> 02:29.798
see if I can get a DA25,
get him shut down.

02:29.918 --> 02:34.527
As very last minute attempts to save the
world go, that's very bureaucratic.

02:35.145 --> 02:37.665
- Do we have an alternative?
- Yes.

02:41.802 --> 02:43.634
I go to New Dawn and
shut it down.

02:44.744 --> 02:48.589
I gave him the security codes; he's got the
schematics to the whole building, if he can

02:48.709 --> 02:52.296
make it to the machine he should
be able to sabotage it.

02:52.416 --> 02:55.068
I'm going to need you to distract Philip
and keep him away from the machine

02:55.188 --> 02:57.641
and buy me some time, okay?

03:08.831 --> 03:12.954
What an awkward silence.
Anything I should know?

03:13.806 --> 03:17.031
No, no, no, no. Purely routine.

03:18.123 --> 03:20.555
Well, thank you, dismissed.

03:22.261 --> 03:25.874
Come on, those dinosaurs
don't chase themselves.

03:33.354 --> 03:34.640
So...

03:35.468 --> 03:38.270
Philip... what can I
do for you?

03:38.849 --> 03:39.836
Matt...

03:40.717 --> 03:44.065
What if you're not supposed
to stop the machine?

03:44.347 --> 03:47.307
What if it's actually your intervention
that makes everything go wrong?

03:47.427 --> 03:49.351
I deal with that every day.

03:49.471 --> 03:52.805
All I know is there's something I
have to do and I really think this is it.

03:52.925 --> 03:54.532
And if you're wrong?

03:55.554 --> 03:58.902
Well then, I'm responsible for the
deaths of everybody on the planet.

04:05.404 --> 04:07.022
Jess what have you got?

04:07.142 --> 04:09.860
Just give me a second, okay...
it's somewhere in

04:09.980 --> 04:12.456
the city center.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.482
You wouldn't mind telling
me what's going on would you?

04:20.601 --> 04:22.877
(Phone ringing)

04:24.745 --> 04:27.195
- James Lester.
(Jess) - You'd better switch on your TV,

04:27.315 --> 04:30.366
a T-Rex is rampaging through
the city, it's mayhem.

04:30.643 --> 04:33.850
- Thank you. Understood.
- What is it?

04:34.731 --> 04:37.339
It seems our little secret's out.

04:42.999 --> 04:47.951
(Male announcer on TV, indistinctly)

04:59.827 --> 05:02.488
Not exactly the moment for standing
around watching the telly.

05:02.608 --> 05:06.030
Matt, I'm going to see the minister. I'll
be in touch. Oh...

05:06.150 --> 05:09.220
and if someone could think of a cover
story for the six o'clock news.

05:09.340 --> 05:13.084
Okay the plan stays exactly the same. Jess
you coordinate, Abby, Becker, Emily you're

05:13.204 --> 05:15.234
on the T-Rex. Connor keep
Philip here.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.428
Connor! You coming?

05:22.729 --> 05:24.227
Final trials. Remember?

05:24.347 --> 05:27.182
I've got a problem, in the lab,
with the prototype.

05:27.302 --> 05:29.314
I'm gonna need you to
take a look at it.

05:29.434 --> 05:31.992
- So.
- After you.

05:37.513 --> 05:42.411
(Brakes and tires squeal)

05:47.213 --> 05:50.438
(Distant sirens)

05:50.825 --> 05:52.552
So. Where is it?

05:55.498 --> 05:58.846
(Car alarms sounding
in the distance)

05:59.850 --> 06:00.960
This way.

06:04.502 --> 06:07.321
Jess, it's blocked. I don't have
time for this get another route.

06:07.441 --> 06:11.319
The only route that's clear is the one
place no one want's to be... Central Town.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.416
Get me there.

06:12.536 --> 06:14.376
Okay, well turn around and
hang a left.

06:17.780 --> 06:18.714
Okay.

06:22.606 --> 06:25.513
(T-Rex roars in the distance)
This way.

06:26.962 --> 06:28.971
Becker you find the T-Rex.

06:35.138 --> 06:40.064
Help! Help me. You have to help
me my friend, Lacey, she's...

06:40.184 --> 06:41.568
Help me!

06:48.513 --> 06:49.676
Lacey!

06:53.498 --> 06:55.542
Please help my friend,
she's hurt.

06:56.775 --> 06:59.376
- The thing attacked her.
- Okay, let me see.

07:00.949 --> 07:02.517
- What's your name?
- Jenna.

07:02.637 --> 07:05.724
- Are you hurt?
- This wasn't supposed to happen

07:05.844 --> 07:07.682
we just wanted to go shopping.

07:08.210 --> 07:12.017
- Jenna me and you are gonna have to go, ok?
- But what about Lacey?

07:13.014 --> 07:16.344
There's nothing we can do.
She's dead Jenna.

07:20.626 --> 07:23.181
(T-Rex roars in the distance)

07:23.301 --> 07:26.912
I promise you I'll send someone back, I
promise, ok, but we have to go now.

07:27.032 --> 07:29.379
(T-Rex roaring)

07:38.723 --> 07:43.727
(Car alarms sounding and T-Rex
roaring)

07:51.086 --> 07:52.848
I'm sorry but I can't leave her.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.267
Jenna!!

08:15.623 --> 08:17.244
(Jenna screams)

08:21.453 --> 08:23.956
Jenna run to me.

08:24.076 --> 08:26.000
Don't look at it just run to me.

08:28.426 --> 08:29.536
Come on.

08:33.466 --> 08:34.417
Jess.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.339
- T-Rex?
- We're still trying to track it down.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.292
Don't bother, it's here.

08:45.838 --> 08:48.746
Becker, Matt's found it.
80 street plaza.

08:56.046 --> 08:57.720
Okay you move.

09:00.469 --> 09:02.742
Stay down. Stay down.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.362
Stay down.

09:17.633 --> 09:20.100
Hey! Look at me!

09:39.959 --> 09:44.206
I take it back. These things
can take down a fully grown T-Rex.

09:45.122 --> 09:46.426
Eventually.

10:01.163 --> 10:04.193
Well it's not the coupling
transponder,

10:05.002 --> 10:08.297
but then I'm assuming that's the
first thing you would have thought of.

10:08.597 --> 10:10.447
Yeah. Yeah I checked that.

10:15.306 --> 10:18.759
- It's the accelerator coil.
- That was quick.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.072
It's out of sync.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.294
It's a good thing you couldn't start
this. The whole thing would've blown up.

10:28.492 --> 10:29.920
Right, let's get going.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.225
I'm--I'm gonna check this out.

10:42.221 --> 10:43.137
Jess.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.961
- What have we got now?
- It's a second anomaly.

10:49.604 --> 10:51.067
I don't believe it.

10:52.790 --> 10:56.279
No. No that must be some
kind of glitch.

10:57.671 --> 11:00.420
Please let this be
some kind of glitch.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.105
The anomalies they...

11:06.779 --> 11:08.805
they're opening up everywhere.

11:09.684 --> 11:11.446
All over the world.

11:13.189 --> 11:16.204
This is it. Convergence is coming.

11:16.537 --> 11:21.717
(Indistinct TV announcers in
background)

11:25.348 --> 11:27.074
We're about to make history.

11:27.194 --> 11:30.264
(People screaming in background
on TV)

11:36.439 --> 11:39.047
Let's leave the cleaning up
job to the others.

11:44.635 --> 11:46.485
- Good luck.
- You too.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.974
Call in everyone who's off shift.

11:54.094 --> 11:57.302
I don't care where they are,
they're on duty.

11:57.422 --> 12:00.051
There's going to be so many of you out in
the field I'm going to assign team names.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.481
Alpha, Delta and so on.

12:12.247 --> 12:14.749
Matt you're not going to believe.
They're opening around the world.

12:14.869 --> 12:16.811
It means it starts now.

12:16.931 --> 12:19.378
- What?
- Convergence.

12:20.535 --> 12:23.671
Philip must have known it was coming so
he's built his machine to coincide with

12:23.791 --> 12:25.536
***. The Helles Convergence.

12:25.656 --> 12:28.303
Multiple anomalies opening simultaneously
all over the world.

12:28.423 --> 12:31.539
- Can you stop it?
- No, I'm not supposed to. No one is.

12:31.659 --> 12:34.605
Convergence is a natural phenomena.
I'm supposed to stop New Dawn

12:34.725 --> 12:37.495
which has been designed to
interrupt convergence.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.011
What if you don't?

12:39.997 --> 12:41.777
Then it's the start of the end.

12:46.412 --> 12:47.945
How about I shot something.

12:50.534 --> 12:54.972
(Car horn honks twice)
Sorry. Going crazy in here.

12:55.092 --> 12:57.825
Listen Philip they've had to move your car
cause it was blocking people in.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.081
- We're gonna have to wait.
- No, that's alright we'll take yours.

13:00.201 --> 13:02.424
- Where is it.
- Can I just ask you a question first?

13:02.746 --> 13:06.023
Every million years or so the magnetic
poles of the earth reverse.

13:06.143 --> 13:09.512
Anomalies are part of this transition.
In order to survive life on earth

13:09.632 --> 13:12.473
has to adapt to the new conditions,
and it can.

13:12.593 --> 13:14.999
As long as convergence is allowed to
run it's natural path.

13:15.119 --> 13:16.920
Which it has done every time
until now.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.576
You knew this was going to happen.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.955
Yet when I told you about my
theory of convergence

13:21.075 --> 13:22.893
you just dismissed it
like it was nothing.

13:23.013 --> 13:25.971
I couldn't support your theory Connor. If
I had you'd of become distracted working

13:26.091 --> 13:27.751
on contingency plans for
the ARC.

13:27.871 --> 13:29.919
Exactly, now we're not ready and
people are going to die.

13:30.039 --> 13:32.273
You're worng. We are ready.
New Dawn is ready.

13:32.393 --> 13:34.881
It needed to be finished
on time and it is.

13:35.001 --> 13:37.260
Philip's intervention is going to
change that forever.

13:37.380 --> 13:40.738
I needed to keep you focused.
Now where is your car?

13:42.342 --> 13:43.346
Follow me.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.408
You will stop him.

13:46.157 --> 13:47.355
(Sighs)

13:51.637 --> 13:53.717
Jess we're on our way to New Dawn.

13:55.993 --> 13:58.037
The whole city's gridlocked.

13:59.729 --> 14:01.103
Sorry.

14:01.438 --> 14:04.575
New Dawn will open a stable
manmade anomaly.

14:04.695 --> 14:08.110
It will simultaneously close all the
others while absorbing their power.

14:08.797 --> 14:12.022
Just think about it, all that
harnessed energy.

14:13.681 --> 14:15.831
Alpha team what's your status.
Please respond.

14:15.951 --> 14:18.450
(Indistinct radio transmission)

14:18.570 --> 14:20.441
We don't know what the consequences
will be.

14:20.561 --> 14:23.771
Of course I do. New Dawn
will save the world.

14:25.651 --> 14:29.264
(Indistinct TV newscasters)

14:30.779 --> 14:32.505
Look I know a shortcut. Turn
around just here.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.313
- There's no point. Jess said-
- Turn around

14:34.433 --> 14:37.062
just here. You can bypass
two city blocks this way.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.749
(Man on radio)
Reinforcements needed.

14:48.256 --> 14:50.529
Matt. Connor's taking
a shortcut.

14:50.649 --> 14:54.089
(Matt) - I'm in gridlock.
- Becker we've lost contact with Alpha team.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.360
There's an incursion from the Pre-Cambrian.
Can you get there?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.734
We're on our way.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.007
- You're going to need breathing equipment.
- Copy that Jess.

15:04.793 --> 15:07.225
I'm clear of traffic. Five miles
from New Dawn.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.816
(Tires squeal)

15:42.437 --> 15:44.058
Connor do you read me?

15:56.965 --> 15:58.445
We're here Jess.

15:59.414 --> 16:03.062
Pre-Cambrian era. Some sort of
carnivorous world apparently.

16:04.753 --> 16:06.833
- No.
- Jess we're at the incursion.

16:06.953 --> 16:08.101
We're going in.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.845
Jess we're gonna do a
room to room search.

16:14.965 --> 16:16.624
- Ready?
- Ready.

16:33.566 --> 16:34.412
Hey.

16:36.033 --> 16:36.914
Oh...

16:37.531 --> 16:38.993
- You hurt?
- Ouch.

16:39.857 --> 16:42.024
I think... I think I'm
all right.

16:42.429 --> 16:43.557
What was that?

16:43.677 --> 16:45.319
***

16:46.782 --> 16:49.601
My leg's stuck. There's
a-- there's a crowbar in the boot.

16:49.721 --> 16:52.265
We don't have time, but I'll
send someone to help.

16:52.385 --> 16:53.469
You're going to leave me?

16:53.589 --> 16:56.006
The convergence won't last
long Connor.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.703
I'm sorry you know.
I really am.

17:04.531 --> 17:05.412
Philip!

17:05.867 --> 17:08.723
The machine doesn't save the world.
It destroys it.

17:09.146 --> 17:11.489
You know that's not true because
you helped design it.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.193
It was a mistake.

17:14.214 --> 17:17.563
- You have to listen to me. Matt said--
- Matt is a solider

17:17.683 --> 17:19.607
- a grunt.
- He's from the future.

17:21.361 --> 17:24.057
He was sent back because the
world he was living in was dying.

17:25.026 --> 17:28.251
Because it *** for them.
Because of the machine that we built.

17:29.009 --> 17:30.084
***

17:32.229 --> 17:33.744
I can't let you turn it on.

17:34.907 --> 17:39.788
You have no idea how ridiculous
you look right now Connor.

17:39.908 --> 17:42.432
See I know that you think you're
doing the right thing.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.124
But you couldn't be
more wrong.

17:46.322 --> 17:49.159
New Dawn kills <i>everything</i>.

17:49.970 --> 17:52.860
That is pure nonsense.

17:54.855 --> 17:56.441
You haven't given me a choice.

17:58.397 --> 18:00.423
(Gun clicks uselessly)

18:03.535 --> 18:05.226
You see Connor...

18:06.865 --> 18:09.473
I never entirely trusted you.

18:10.143 --> 18:12.680
Don't do this Philip. Please.

18:14.491 --> 18:15.901
You might need that.

18:20.306 --> 18:21.751
Uhhh...

18:22.262 --> 18:23.407
Philip!

18:30.480 --> 18:31.520
Jess.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.603
Matt-- can anybody hear me?

18:58.653 --> 18:59.939
Matt.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.040
Matt I've just come from the
minister's office.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.344
How'd it go?

19:04.464 --> 19:08.543
His exact words, "World's in chaos, we've
got dinosaurs rampaging in the streets

19:08.663 --> 19:12.103
and you're worried about Philip's research.
Have you gone completely insane?"

19:12.223 --> 19:13.312
That well huh?

19:13.432 --> 19:16.008
The official line is our only priority
is managing the anomalies

19:16.128 --> 19:17.611
and the creature incursions.

19:17.946 --> 19:19.250
Unofficially?

19:23.308 --> 19:26.462
Stop him...
Do whatever you have to.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.656
(Busy signal)
(Connor grunts)

19:32.134 --> 19:34.090
(Creature growls)

19:35.024 --> 19:37.138
(Creature growls)

19:39.352 --> 19:40.779
Blast.

19:55.648 --> 19:58.080
Behind every speaker is a magnet.

20:17.691 --> 20:18.608
Hey!

20:23.912 --> 20:26.149
(Creature growls)

20:29.211 --> 20:31.748
(Creature squeals)

20:44.958 --> 20:46.896
Becker, Abby, I need you to split up.

20:47.016 --> 20:49.187
Delta units *** malfunctioning.

20:49.531 --> 20:51.487
- Paper, scissors, stones?
- All right.

20:51.963 --> 20:55.452
- One, two, three.
- Ha!

20:56.209 --> 20:59.346
Guess I'll go then. Good
luck with the job.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.522
(Cell phone rings)

21:04.002 --> 21:05.624
Connor. Where are you?

21:05.744 --> 21:07.368
Listen I'm trapped and there's a--

21:07.488 --> 21:10.276
Just get to Stanus street car
park as soon as you can.

21:10.396 --> 21:11.462
I'm on my way.

21:34.587 --> 21:37.776
- I've done the system analysis check.
- Well done.

21:38.939 --> 21:41.494
We have to do this during
convergence.

21:48.312 --> 21:50.815
(Mechanical female voice)
Start up sequence commencing.

22:08.266 --> 22:09.676
(Matt) - Okay?
(Emily) - Um-hum.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.490
(Pterosaurs call)

22:32.116 --> 22:33.349
Pterosaurs.

23:25.305 --> 23:26.380
Right.

23:43.551 --> 23:46.194
Come on. Come on.

24:10.488 --> 24:13.942
(Car alarm sounds)

24:18.781 --> 24:20.032
Hey.

24:21.546 --> 24:23.995
- There's a crowbar in the boot.
- What?

24:24.115 --> 24:25.916
- There's a crowbar in the--
- I know.

24:26.251 --> 24:28.436
(Gun fires, alarm stops)

24:29.420 --> 24:32.416
Nice. I just said there's
a crowbar in the boot.

24:35.990 --> 24:38.281
- Connor.
- What's it doing.

24:38.401 --> 24:39.761
I'll get you out.

25:23.768 --> 25:26.552
- You all right?
- Uhh.

25:26.672 --> 25:28.914
We need to get to New Dawn
and help Matt.

25:29.034 --> 25:31.041
But if Matt's right then that
machine is more dangerous

25:31.161 --> 25:32.609
than all those creatures
put together.

25:35.041 --> 25:38.177
I helped build this. I need
to make it right.

25:39.459 --> 25:45.433
I am so sorry... everything that we've been
through, I should have trusted you.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.603
Instead I put Philip's word
above yours, I mean how--

25:49.723 --> 25:52.107
- Hey.
- How could I even have done that?

25:52.227 --> 25:54.891
When I put my finger on your lips
it means you stop talking.

25:55.349 --> 25:57.418
Okay. Sorry.

25:57.538 --> 25:58.660
(Abby laughs)

26:01.250 --> 26:02.924
This is the part where you kiss me.

26:17.167 --> 26:19.722
- Ready to go do our job?
- Why not?

26:20.479 --> 26:23.175
(Jess) Alpha team what's your status?
Please respond.

26:24.973 --> 26:26.347
Alpha team respond.

26:27.214 --> 26:32.958
Ok, we've got another anomaly. Cordinates
44' 75". Have we got any units available?

26:33.078 --> 26:34.333
Negative on response time.

26:34.453 --> 26:37.117
Unit 8 can you hear me. Are you
availabe to move into position?

26:38.147 --> 26:39.292
How are we doing?

26:39.412 --> 26:41.900
There are too many. I can't control it. We
need more medics,

26:42.020 --> 26:44.401
- more locking devices, more people.
- You're doing fine.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.798
Jess. Look at me, Jess.

26:47.185 --> 26:51.062
You are the hub of this operation. You may
not get the credit you deserve but you

26:51.182 --> 26:55.069
do a brilliant job, and if anyone
can pull us through this, you can.

26:55.932 --> 26:57.712
That's the nicest thing you've
ever said to me.

26:57.832 --> 27:01.025
I think it's really the nicest thing I've
ever said to anyone, including my wife.

27:02.018 --> 27:03.710
- Do you mean it.
- Every word.

27:04.062 --> 27:07.146
Now get back to work before
we both start crying about it.

27:07.675 --> 27:09.789
And if it's personal you need
I'll be clicking my heels.

27:09.909 --> 27:11.269
What have you got for
me in the field?

27:11.389 --> 27:14.206
Preferably something cuddly and
vegetarian cause this is my best shirt.

27:14.326 --> 27:16.761
To be honest I could really
do with a hand here.

27:16.881 --> 27:18.665
- Sure that should be interesting.
- Okay.

27:18.785 --> 27:20.037
Show me which buttons to press.

27:20.157 --> 27:22.839
- There you go.
- So...

27:23.931 --> 27:26.187
Becker what are your stats?
Can you spare any men?

27:29.431 --> 27:32.356
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy
at the moment.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.189
How's the big picture?

27:34.841 --> 27:37.889
Not good. Every time we lock
an anomaly another one opens.

27:38.009 --> 27:40.284
I think we might just about
have this one.

27:40.404 --> 27:42.275
(Creature roars)

27:42.751 --> 27:43.702
Becker?

27:44.718 --> 27:45.698
Becker?

27:49.367 --> 27:51.710
(Mechanical female voice)
Nine minutes to initiation.

27:54.352 --> 27:55.479
Oh!

27:56.854 --> 27:57.946
Oh!

27:59.530 --> 28:00.869
Wait!

28:03.442 --> 28:05.961
Did you really think you'd get
away with this?

28:06.807 --> 28:08.851
Take them out of the building.

28:30.057 --> 28:32.295
(Mechanical female voice)
Eight minutes to initiation.

28:38.074 --> 28:40.083
I really wouldn't open that
if I were you.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.188
(Mechanical female voice)
Seven minutes to initiation.

29:23.757 --> 29:25.008
Hey.

29:28.021 --> 29:29.748
- Good to see you.
- You too.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.440
He's already started
New Dawn.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.326
Initialization. There's still time.
Leave the machine to me.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.798
You cover Connor, I'm
going after Philip.

30:06.897 --> 30:08.377
Pterosaurs.

30:08.497 --> 30:09.706
(Mechanical female voice)
Five minutes to initiation.

30:09.826 --> 30:11.432
We don't have much time,
come on.

30:22.938 --> 30:26.021
(Pterosaurs call)

30:33.812 --> 30:35.874
Make sure nobody follows me.

31:43.498 --> 31:44.781
Here we go.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.020
Yes....

32:10.295 --> 32:12.860
(Alarm sounds)

32:12.980 --> 32:15.072
Who's operating the
satellite terminal?

32:15.369 --> 32:17.570
(Mechanical female voice)
30 seconds till shutdown.

32:19.610 --> 32:22.168
- It's Connor
- Get him down from there.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.374
I can do this.

32:39.979 --> 32:41.521
Don't you love this.

32:47.671 --> 32:48.781
Okay.

32:50.113 --> 32:52.258
Here we go. This is not good.

32:52.378 --> 32:55.756
Damn it. Philip's locked me
out of the system.

32:55.876 --> 32:58.239
(Mechanical female voice)
Initiation reactivated.

33:00.259 --> 33:02.760
(Mechanical female voice)
Start up sequence commencing.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.337
Um-- I don't know what to do.

33:06.447 --> 33:08.440
I don't think I can
hack this in time.

33:09.047 --> 33:10.101
Too many...

33:12.903 --> 33:14.840
Connor. I can't hear you.

33:15.936 --> 33:17.354
Connor can you hear me?

33:23.140 --> 33:24.964
Shut it down.

33:26.776 --> 33:29.390
- You've got it all wrong Matt.
- You two. Move!

33:30.519 --> 33:31.873
Move!

33:32.644 --> 33:35.522
- Shut it down now Philip.
- Have you seen outside?

33:35.642 --> 33:37.497
Shut it down now.

33:37.617 --> 33:40.740
It's chaos. This machine
will stop all that.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.279
Nature has to be allowed to
run it's own course.

33:44.031 --> 33:45.987
You're about to destroy
the world.

33:46.570 --> 33:50.379
I've seen the results of your work.
Is that what you want for your legacy?

33:50.499 --> 33:53.179
There are dinosaurs roaming
the streets.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.781
That's what the ARC's for.

33:54.901 --> 33:58.652
ARC has failed. We don't
need containment

33:58.772 --> 34:01.323
we need radical solutions.

34:08.295 --> 34:11.324
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

34:12.842 --> 34:15.681
Yeah. If I have to.

34:18.353 --> 34:20.196
I don't believe you.

34:20.315 --> 34:21.400
Ooh!

34:23.603 --> 34:26.425
(Philip coughs)
Stop him.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.772
Philip!

34:34.002 --> 34:36.523
Yes. Back up.

34:49.534 --> 34:52.187
Philip you don't know what
you're gonna do!

34:52.306 --> 34:54.501
You really don't.

34:55.944 --> 34:58.502
- Philip.
- I'm nearly--

35:01.399 --> 35:02.452
No.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.484
(Mechanical female voice)
Three minutes to initiation.

35:28.329 --> 35:32.768
Coupling transponder,
accelerator coil...

35:35.876 --> 35:38.227
I can reverse the
accelerator coil.

35:44.326 --> 35:46.169
I can't believe it, there's
another one.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.926
It's outside.

35:49.979 --> 35:52.462
- In the car park.
- Oh my God.

35:52.937 --> 35:57.037
My new Jag's in the car park.
This time it's personal.

36:02.402 --> 36:04.039
Stop!

36:11.078 --> 36:13.674
(Mechanical female voice)
- Start up sequence commencing. - Philip.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.215
It's working.

36:27.335 --> 36:28.945
Philip NO!

36:30.255 --> 36:35.032
Come on April. Don't give me an
excuse to fry you.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.461
You wouldn't dare.

36:44.607 --> 36:46.413
(April screams)

37:43.602 --> 37:50.280
(Mechanical female voice)
Five, Four, Three, Two, One...

37:50.656 --> 37:53.289
Execute final command.

38:09.193 --> 38:12.974
Abby, Emily, get out of here.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.515
Oy!

38:32.152 --> 38:34.635
Have you any idea how much that
thing costs.

39:30.120 --> 39:34.296
The only problem is... you
believe the world will be destroyed

39:34.416 --> 39:39.793
when I switch this machine on. And
I believe it will be destroyed if I don't.

39:39.913 --> 39:44.160
Philip. You've gotta listen to me I've seen
this. You're gonna kill everything.

40:15.242 --> 40:18.308
(Mechanical female voice)
Power to the main turbine disrupted.

40:20.124 --> 40:22.362
Only one of us can be right.

40:29.044 --> 40:31.266
(Mechanical female voice)
Auxiliary power activated.

40:31.386 --> 40:33.939
You think I didn't anticipate
Connor?

40:50.226 --> 40:51.467
No!

40:54.157 --> 40:58.276
No!!! Connor!!!

40:59.444 --> 41:03.563
- No. No. Let me go.
- Stop. Stop.

41:04.071 --> 41:05.820
Stop Abby.

41:18.596 --> 41:20.195
What's going on?

41:53.460 --> 41:58.839
Cheer up man. Everything's
fine. It's working.

42:04.453 --> 42:07.067
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you ever saw in your life?

42:35.056 --> 42:36.372
They've all closed.

42:36.492 --> 42:38.742
- All of them?
- Every last one.

42:39.363 --> 42:40.830
Is that good or...

42:42.824 --> 42:44.178
is that bad?

42:45.733 --> 42:48.517
(Male announcer) We are receiving unconfirmed
reports from around the globe.

42:48.637 --> 42:51.037
the mysterious golden lights
are vanishing.
