00:01.468 --> 00:04.670
I called this staff meeting
because lately,

00:04.672 --> 00:07.773
I've noticed our diner family
is drifting apart.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.375
Good work, everybody.
Good work.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.143
Yeah!

00:11.145 --> 00:12.978
Let's start off this powwow

00:12.980 --> 00:15.381
By sharing our highs and lows
of the week.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.949
My high was getting

00:16.951 --> 00:19.618
A particularly interesting
snapple fact.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.953
And my low was--

00:20.955 --> 00:22.521
Your entire body?

00:23.823 --> 00:26.558
I'll go.
My high was finding a barrette

00:26.560 --> 00:28.360
In the bathroom,
and my low

00:28.362 --> 00:31.630
Was imagining my new life
without it.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.032
Max, your high?

00:33.034 --> 00:35.534
I certainly am.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.504
And my low will be
when it wears off.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.706
Well, my high was catching
a glimpse

00:40.708 --> 00:42.708
Of a customer's lacy g-string,

00:42.710 --> 00:46.211
And my low
was seeing his junk.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.982
My low is this meeting.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.751
And my high
is when it wraps up.

00:52.753 --> 00:56.488
Can everybody
take this serious--

00:56.490 --> 00:59.691
[high-pitched]
I have a new low.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.394
I have a new high.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.163
Me too.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.431
Everybody, please.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.067

his vagina.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.157
That's not my phone.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.926
My ringtone is <i>let it go,</i>
<i>and you know that</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:36.562
'cause you threaten to beat me
every time it rings.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.830
Well, it's not mine.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.231
I keep my phone on vibrate

01:39.233 --> 01:41.066
Out of respect
for those around me,

01:41.068 --> 01:43.302
And also for little orgasms.

Max, it's the landline.

Oh, god!

01:48.109 --> 01:49.308
Why is it ringing?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.809
You said that phone
only rings

01:50.811 --> 01:52.478
If we're in trouble
or if it's you

01:52.480 --> 01:54.746
Calling from the future
to tell us we're in trouble.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.589
That's gotta be the landlord.
The lease is up.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.557
Fine, we'll just renew it,
even though I thought

02:05.559 --> 02:07.259
They would have condemned
this place by now.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.828
I mean, I did find a used condom
in the hallway yesterday.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.063
[phone rings]

02:11.065 --> 02:12.364
Hello?
No!

02:12.366 --> 02:14.233
Hang up.
We're not on the lease.

02:14.235 --> 02:18.937
[speaks japanese]

02:18.939 --> 02:21.006
Good cover.
Now we just have to hope

02:21.008 --> 02:23.909
The original tenant
is a benihana chef.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.177
Okay.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.845
We don't have much time.
Quick!

02:26.847 --> 02:29.648
Grab two things you love.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.789
I-I love nothing in here!

02:37.791 --> 02:40.425
And why are we even trying
to keep an apartment

02:40.427 --> 02:43.195
That has grass growing
in the bathroom?

02:43.197 --> 02:45.931
I love our toilet lawn.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.366
It's gross.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.767
Max, look at this place.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.970
Our refrigerator door
is held on by scotch tape,

02:51.972 --> 02:53.772
And, I mean,
there is black mold in there.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.741
At least the black mold
made the other mold

02:55.743 --> 02:58.143
Move out of the neighborhood.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.344
Come on!

02:59.346 --> 03:00.946
Someone from
the real estate company

03:00.948 --> 03:02.281
Is probably on their way over
to make sure

03:02.283 --> 03:03.882
The original tenant
still lives here.

[phone rings]

03:05.953 --> 03:07.886
All right, let's ride!

03:07.888 --> 03:09.788
I know a guy that can drop off
some fake passports

03:09.790 --> 03:11.323
For us in an airport locker.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.859
Well, you know him too.
It's oleg.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.060
Hey!

03:15.062 --> 03:17.696
Pick up that phone already!

03:17.698 --> 03:21.233
Sounds like a damn
pbs fund-raiser down here.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.569
Sophie,
it's the landlord calling.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.971
I just found out we've been
subletting illegally.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.806
Oh, well, I always wondered
how you girls

03:27.808 --> 03:30.075
Could afford to live
in this building.

03:30.077 --> 03:33.912
And I ruled out prostitution
once I saw caroline dance.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.186
Good news.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.421
I dug around the apartment

03:42.423 --> 03:43.889
And I found the original lease.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.024
Also found a copy
of my birth certificate.

03:46.026 --> 03:50.395
Turns out my father's name
is "mother has no idea."

03:50.397 --> 03:52.197
Forget that lease.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.865
I've already found
a new place for us.

03:53.867 --> 03:58.370
A two-bedroom for $1,300
in manhattan.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.673
Oh...
Manhattan, kansas.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.609
We can't afford
to lose this lease.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.144
As soon as they find out this
lester donovan

04:06.146 --> 04:08.347
Is no longer living there,
the rent will get higher

04:08.349 --> 04:11.516
Than justin bieber on a plane
with his dad.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.688
So I tracked down this original
tenant guy, lester.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.290
He's still alive.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.659
Ugh!
Can't catch a break.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.395
He's at a rest home
in sheepshead bay.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.664
We just have to go there
and kidnap him.

04:25.666 --> 04:30.068
We'll tie some cream of wheat
to a pole and lure him out.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.970
First of all,
in what world

04:31.972 --> 04:34.873
Do we have cream of wheat
pole money?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.943
And secondly, I am not gonna go
shake down some old man.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.177
You won't have to.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.613
He's probably already shaking.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.383
If you're looking,
I know a place.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.151
You share a twin bed
with two other girls.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.686
Oh, and there are cameras.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.688
But you're paid
$4.99 a minute

04:49.690 --> 04:52.224
And get to meet all the singles
in your area.

04:52.226 --> 04:55.627
Are you one of the singles
in the area?

04:55.629 --> 05:01.433
Technically I'd be your costar.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.936
Like it or not, we have to
hold on to our apartment.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.307
Max is right--there are two
things in life you cannot lose.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.777
A rent-controlled apartment
and bladder control.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.781
Actually, there's an apartment
in my building

05:15.783 --> 05:17.249
That just became available.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.151
Stop by tomorrow.
You can see it.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.391
This place is $1,200?

05:26.393 --> 05:29.995
$1,250. It just went up
since we been talking.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.797
We can't fit in here.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.165
I'm not talking about
me and you.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.633
I'm talking about
me and my boobs.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.105
Nice retirement home.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.540
Why don't we just
live here?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.743
Bingo tournaments,
unlimited hard candy,

05:44.745 --> 05:47.679
And you get to crap
your pants!

05:50.049 --> 05:52.050
Lester?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.652
That must be him.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.388
I don't know who I am anymore,
but that must be him.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.157
Hi, mr. Donovan.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.659
Lester?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.728
Max, is he dead?

06:02.730 --> 06:05.731
No, he's alive, but <i>just...</i>

06:05.733 --> 06:07.332
This is so sad.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.501
Look at how we treat
our elderly.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.536
Wake up!

06:11.538 --> 06:15.540
I-I-I need you
to wake up for this!

06:15.542 --> 06:19.077
We are currently subletting
your old apartment,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.579
And we need you to pretend

06:20.581 --> 06:22.848
You still live there
for a day.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.184
Or just to pretend
you still live.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.153
Ladies, you're wasting
your time.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.188
He can't speak,
and he doesn't like girls.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.624
He's a vegetable
<i>and</i> a fruit.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.761
Lester donovan.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.196
Oh, you're lester!
Oh, thank god.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.598
Listen, lester,
we need you--

06:39.600 --> 06:41.400
I know, I know.
You want me to pretend

06:41.402 --> 06:43.335
I still live in your apartment.
I overheard everything.

06:43.337 --> 06:46.505
We're not all comatose, darling.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.441
But I'm afraid--ahem--
it's not gonna happen, girls.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.109
'cause I got a big week.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.044
My special lady
is moving in with me.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.579
Heh heh.
'cause this guy's

06:54.581 --> 06:56.181
Not gonna be around
much longer.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.418
18 hours...Tops!

07:00.620 --> 07:02.320
Oh! Here's my princess.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.588
Olivia!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.924
Oh...

07:05.926 --> 07:07.292
He's still with us.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.261
God bless.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.296
So we'll have to push
the move to Monday.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.932
Yeah...
About that, lester.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.601
I'm not ready
to move in with you.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.137
Olivia,
wh--what do you mean?

07:19.139 --> 07:22.507
Max, we should go.
No way!
This is like watching

07:22.509 --> 07:24.776
An elder version of
<i>the bachelor!</i>

07:24.778 --> 07:28.013
Literally...
The final rose!

07:29.382 --> 07:31.683
Lester, it's not you.
It's me.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.152
That's still in play
at their age?

07:34.154 --> 07:37.122
I'm just not ready
to settle down.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.292
Too many other fish
in the sea.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.461

that new kid on the block,

07:42.463 --> 07:45.330
Morty what's-his-name.
It's about morty, isn't it?

07:45.332 --> 07:46.798
Lester, please.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.567
I don't want it
to be weird

07:48.569 --> 07:51.636
When we see each other
at bingo.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.371
You should know this
about morty--

07:53.373 --> 07:55.474
He's not a real man
like me.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.443
His middle name
is viagra!

07:58.445 --> 08:00.479
Olivia!

08:05.418 --> 08:07.319
Well, there's no point
hanging around here.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.155
I'll just grab my penis pump,
and we're outta here.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.060
Why is he gonna need that?

08:19.298 --> 08:20.732
Here we are, "home, sweet...

08:20.734 --> 08:23.802
At least it's not
a rest home."

08:23.804 --> 08:27.439
Lester, not that I minded
pushing you 35 blocks, but...

08:27.441 --> 08:29.307
You could walk at the home.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.076
Why can't you walk now?

08:31.078 --> 08:34.145
I'm too depressed to walk.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.580
I've been depressed
since I learned to walk.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.350
I mean, I was nine.
It was time.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.419
I have just lost
the love of my life!

08:41.421 --> 08:43.755
Have you ever made love
to a lady with no teeth

08:43.757 --> 08:45.991
And two plastic hips?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.926
I, for one, have not.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.528
Max?

08:49.530 --> 08:53.932
No. But it just rocketed
to number one on my bucket list.

08:53.934 --> 08:58.069
I lived here
from 1954 to studio 54.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.339
Liza minnelli
threw up in that corner.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.041
The only time I ever saw
anybody

09:03.043 --> 09:05.877
Take three bows
after a vomit.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.179
Why did you leave?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.615
You always think you're gonna
find something better.

09:10.617 --> 09:14.052
Yep. The toilet grass
is always greener.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.520
[buzzer]

09:15.522 --> 09:17.322
Okay. That's the building
rep, lester.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.291
Do we need to go over
our cover story again?

09:19.293 --> 09:21.059
It's pretty easy.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.662

Hot-tempered

09:28.902 --> 09:31.036
Lester,
only listen to me.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.504
Max is your granddaughter,

09:32.506 --> 09:34.239
And I'm her sober companion--

09:34.241 --> 09:36.541
Which is the only part
of our story that's true.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.310
[knocking]

09:38.312 --> 09:41.313
It's him--now, just sit
and smile and nod.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.582
I'll nod,
but I'm not gonna smile.

09:45.851 --> 09:48.153
Welcome
to my grandfather's

09:48.155 --> 09:50.422
Happy, happy home.
There's his couch.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.489
There's his kitchen.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.691
What's this?

09:52.693 --> 09:55.460
There's his bong.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.028
His <i>bong.</i>

09:57.030 --> 09:59.698
Glaucoma.
Chemo.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.099
Well, good afternoon.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.567
I'm roger
from building management.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.802
I'm here to verify this lease,

10:03.804 --> 10:05.236
And I'd like to do it

10:05.238 --> 10:07.138
Before the rest of
this doorway caves in.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.074
And of course you know
my dear,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.875
Dear grandfather lester.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.945
I just have a few questions,
mr. Donovan.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.480
Have you ever made love
to a woman

10:15.482 --> 10:17.716
With a silicone hip?

10:17.718 --> 10:20.352
[whispers]
it's amazing!

10:20.354 --> 10:23.922
Okay! I can cross
that one off my list.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.523
Hey, girls.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.158
I came through the back

10:27.160 --> 10:28.860
'cause this junkie's
on the front stoop,

10:28.862 --> 10:31.930
And it's still a little
awkward between us.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.165
[girls stammering]

10:34.167 --> 10:38.003
Oh, uh, this is sophie.
She lives upstairs.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.838
As you can see, roger,
no problems.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.107
Everything's
totally legit.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.809
Hey, who's the old guy?

10:44.811 --> 10:48.313
She lives upstairs,
and she doesn't know lester?

10:48.315 --> 10:52.117
She knows him--this is
just a sexual game they play

10:52.119 --> 10:55.020
Called "who are you?"

10:55.022 --> 10:57.522
That doesn't sound like
a sexual game.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.791
It is when she's
saying it to his penis.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.796
Sophie, this is the guy
from the agency

11:04.798 --> 11:06.264
Who just came by to verify

11:06.266 --> 11:08.700
That lester
actually lives here.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.735
Oh, yeah!

11:10.737 --> 11:12.971
He lives here every day!

11:12.973 --> 11:15.974
Yeah, and we play
that game forever.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.343
[shouting]
who <i>are you?</i>

11:19.745 --> 11:23.615
Come closer.
He can't hear you.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.750
I'm feeling better already.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.485
So the main takeaway here

11:27.487 --> 11:29.421
Is that they both live
in the building legally.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.256
Now, let's just
sign that lease.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.124
All right, mr. Donovan,
I just need your signature here,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.260
And this'll lock you into the
lease for another four years.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.295
What's your hip situation?

11:37.297 --> 11:40.065
Oh, I'm as hip as they come,
baby! Yeah!

11:42.001 --> 11:43.935
Now, that's a looker!

11:43.937 --> 11:46.271
Here ya go.
Yep! All done.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.007
You have the apartment
for another four years.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.408
Enjoy it?

11:52.178 --> 11:54.879
Oh, and I'm required to say:
Traces of cancerous stuff

11:54.881 --> 11:57.115
Have been found
in some of the apartments.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.017
Have a nice day!

12:00.786 --> 12:02.187
[door closes]

12:02.189 --> 12:04.689
Four more years!
Four more years!

12:04.691 --> 12:06.124
We get to
stay in the place

12:06.126 --> 12:07.726
I never thought
I'd want to stay in.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.527
Oh, lester, you're up.
Feeling better?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.429
Like a million bucks.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.965
I feel like my old self again.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.267
Oh, hey,
it's been 18 hours.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.203
Let's go see
if your friend's dead.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.071
Yeah, lester.
Let's get ya home.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.474
What are you talking about?
I am home.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.576
What do you mean?
This is our place.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.045
Not according to that lease
I just signed.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.015
I'll be in my bedroom.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.885
Good to be home!

12:35.221 --> 12:37.222
Ruh-roh...
Ruh-roh.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.495
Ladies, this is delicious!

12:43.497 --> 12:46.731
You know, at the home
they keep salt on lockdown.

12:46.733 --> 12:51.302
Salt and the dementia patients.

12:51.304 --> 12:55.673
Well, it doesn't look like
bad grandpa's leaving tonight.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.275
Maybe I can help.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.411
I can put some ground glass
in his salisbury steak.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.748
It's called
a ukrainian divorce.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.352
Eh...I'll try
this jell-o first.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.387
Yeah, it's so old,
it might kill him.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.757
Lester, I brought you
some jell-o.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.459
Would you like some?
That's very nice of you,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.928
But I'm not going anywhere.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.365
Lester, really, you don't
want to live with us.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.267
Caroline sings so much

13:22.269 --> 13:24.536
She should have
animated birds on her.

13:24.538 --> 13:28.673
Look, there's no way I'm going
back to that retirement home.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.476
I feel alive for
the first time since...

13:31.478 --> 13:34.779
Since I died briefly
last year.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.348
Oh, my god, really?

13:37.350 --> 13:41.119
Yes, some nurse tripped
over the power cord.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.455
A-and besides, it's really
helping me get over olivia.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.126
I'm finally realizing there are
plenty of other fish in the sea.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.629
Hey, everybody!

13:51.631 --> 13:55.533
And there's one of 'em.
[chuckles]

13:55.535 --> 13:58.369
She puts the "ass"
in "bass."

13:58.371 --> 14:01.272
Friend, I'll be
in my booth.

14:01.274 --> 14:05.143
Hey, sophie.
You remember lester.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.279
Lester, you remember
when they discovered fire.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.548
Please, please,
join me.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.217
May I buy you an egg cream?

14:12.219 --> 14:15.987
Oh, I do love
an egg cream.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.723
Oh, excuse me, I gotta go
powder by nose.

14:20.226 --> 14:21.893
Girls...

14:21.895 --> 14:23.962
Girls, I know you want
your apartment back

14:23.964 --> 14:25.630
And I'm a reasonable man,

14:25.632 --> 14:29.400
So all I want before I go is
a little you-know-what.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.936
More jell-o?

14:31.938 --> 14:35.173
I'm talking about sex.
Rebound sex!

14:35.175 --> 14:37.075
Rebound sex?

14:37.077 --> 14:41.145
Are you sure you'll even be able
to rebound from having sex?

14:41.147 --> 14:42.747
Are you kidding?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.316
There's nothing but sex
at that retirement home.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.419
Why do you think
I put myself there?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.921
It's wall-to-wall whoopee,

14:49.923 --> 14:53.491
And you don't even have
to drive home after.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.562
Now, I have in mind
a certain elegant lady.

14:57.564 --> 15:02.667
Ahh, you're out of t.P.!

15:02.669 --> 15:05.069
You can set me up for
one night with your friend,

15:05.071 --> 15:07.171
And I will gladly leave
the apartment.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.507
[chuckles]

15:09.509 --> 15:12.510
I'll be in your booth.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.712
Hey, sophie, you'll get with
that old guy, right?

15:14.714 --> 15:18.182
Are you fricking kidding me?

15:21.353 --> 15:23.021
Lester, she didn't
go for it.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.722
I'm not going back
to that retirement home

15:24.724 --> 15:26.357
With my tail between my legs.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.527
I gotta sleep with someone
to make olivia jealous.

15:29.529 --> 15:34.032
There's a new thing that
kids are doing called "lying."

15:34.034 --> 15:35.566
Why don't you
just make something up?

15:35.568 --> 15:38.536
Pics
or it didn't happen.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.606
I need a selfie with
whoever I hook up with

15:41.608 --> 15:44.142
For my facebook page.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.711
And if it's not gonna be sophie,

15:46.713 --> 15:50.415
My guess, it's gonna be
one of you two up in bed...

15:50.417 --> 15:53.217
Slugger.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.054
Slugger.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.357
♪ take me out
to the ball game ♪

15:59.359 --> 16:01.426
♪ take me out

16:03.629 --> 16:06.631
Now I know
why liza threw up.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.640
Now I'm depressed.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.675
So you lost the straw pull

16:17.677 --> 16:20.411
For who's gonna
sleep with lester.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.881
Look, you've been saying
you wanted to have sex

16:23.883 --> 16:26.951
And you've also been saying
you wanna go antiquing.

16:28.921 --> 16:33.091
So, behind that door
are both.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.060
And, max, I think you cheated
in that straw pull.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.862
Of course I cheated!

16:37.864 --> 16:40.264
Look, I have had
a lot of crazy sex.

16:40.266 --> 16:44.268
I once did it with
a clown at a funeral.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.838
But I cannot
see that penis pump.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.873
I won't be able to
come back from that.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.476
You think I can?

16:51.478 --> 16:56.781
I do, I think the science part
of your brain would enjoy it.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.284
Ladies, I've stretched.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.186
I'm ready.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.257
Fine, I'll take the bullet.

17:06.259 --> 17:10.828
I don't think there are
any bullets in that gun.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.997
Are you sure?

17:12.999 --> 17:17.001
'cause I don't wanna have
an old baby.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.503
This is ridiculous

17:18.505 --> 17:20.271
That we're even entertaining
the thought

17:20.273 --> 17:23.408
Of doing anything with
an old man that isn't a trump.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.144
Max, I can't do this.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.311
One of us will
just have to take

17:27.313 --> 17:28.413
That apartment
in earl's building

17:28.415 --> 17:31.516
And you will find
another place.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.785
But then we'd have to
live apart.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.554
I know, but I don't see
another choice.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.023
I'm not ready to live
without you.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.726
I'm not ready to live
without you.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.264
[screaming]

17:52.438 --> 17:56.074
[screaming]

17:56.076 --> 17:57.375
What?

17:57.377 --> 18:00.645
I saw the pump!
Pack your things!

18:00.647 --> 18:03.581
Max, I can't believe you were
almost willing to do that

18:03.583 --> 18:05.483
To live with me.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.986
You know what,
I'm going in.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.755
Because the thought of
not seeing you

18:10.757 --> 18:14.125
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
would kill me!

18:18.764 --> 18:21.132
We'll meet every Saturday
morning for coffee.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.469
Less and less over time,
of course.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.905
<i>(lester)</i>
<i>that was a good start.</i>
<i>What else you got?</i>

18:27.907 --> 18:29.974
(both)
nothing!

18:29.976 --> 18:34.912
Ah, I'm really liking
this whole back door thing.

18:34.914 --> 18:39.717
Wow, that's the first time
I've ever said that.

18:41.353 --> 18:42.954
Don't get used to it,
sophie.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.256
You never do.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.291
No, I mean, we're gonna
have to leave this place.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.093
We couldn't do it
with lester.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.863
I know,
that's why I'm here.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.165
You don't have to
do this for us.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.701
If you two didn't
live in this building,

18:56.703 --> 18:59.003
Then we'd drift apart

18:59.005 --> 19:02.106
And we'd only see each other
on saturdays for coffee.

19:02.108 --> 19:05.910
Well...
I'd probably only go once.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.381
Look, just give me 90 seconds.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.151
I mean, he's got a pump.
How hard could it be?

19:14.620 --> 19:16.387
She's amazing.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.256
We should probably get her
something for this.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.757
What would be appropriate?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.192
That good candle
under the sink?

19:21.194 --> 19:23.261
We've only used it once.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.097
That seems right.
[door clicking]

19:26.099 --> 19:31.202
I don't know what that was,
but I'm not up to it.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.038
I-I don't think my heart
could take it.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.107
Afraid sex with sophie
would kill you?

19:36.109 --> 19:38.442
Yeah, that's why I
haven't gone there.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.112
You know, I was all excited
about--about all the--

19:41.114 --> 19:42.446
All the other fish in the sea.

19:42.448 --> 19:46.150
[laughs]
that was a great white shark!

19:46.152 --> 19:48.619
Hey, come on!

19:48.621 --> 19:51.822
I just stretched.
I'm ready.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.925
Look, uh, could we get
a quick pic?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.994
I might've gone there, too,
if I knew he had an iphone 5s.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.764
Try to be as sexy as possible.
Oh, okay, yeah.

19:59.766 --> 20:04.068
[chuckles]

20:04.070 --> 20:08.139
When olivia sees that,
she's gonna say, "morty who?"

20:09.174 --> 20:12.343
Girls, enjoy your apartment.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.679
I had some
lovely times here.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.181
Thank you so much, lester.
Bye, grandpa.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.584
Maybe sometime we could
come visit you in the home.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.553
Email me.
We'll talk.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.324
That's still in play
at his age?

20:26.326 --> 20:29.360
Hey, thanks for the blue balls,
lester!

20:32.030 --> 20:34.599
Nighty-night, girls.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.374
Max, we get
to stay together!

20:43.376 --> 20:44.375
[gasps]
and even better,

20:44.377 --> 20:46.877
He left his wheelchair!

20:46.879 --> 20:50.815
Push me into the kitchen,
I wanna crack open a beer.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.284
I wonder if I'll be pushing you
like this when you're 70.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.254
You'll be pushing me
like this when I'm 30.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.623
[gasps]

20:58.625 --> 21:00.791
There's no place
like home.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.460
I'll go get
the scotch tape.
