WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.767

00:06.767 --> 00:08.967
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.000

UNDERWEAR?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.433
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:12.433 --> 00:15.467
OH.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.567
- TOILETRIES?

00:23.567 --> 00:28.133
- YUP.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.500
I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.200
I FEEL LIKE
I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.500
- NO, YOU SHOULD JUST GO
'CAUSE YOU COULD BUY

00:32.500 --> 00:34.567
WHATEVER YOU NEED
AT THE HOTEL.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.100
- YEAH, I GUESS.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.200
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.967

WHERE'S MY GOOD-BYE KISS?

00:40.967 --> 00:43.033
- ALL RIGHT.

00:43.033 --> 00:44.100
- MWAH.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.233
- SEE YOU THURSDAY.
- OKAY.

00:47.233 --> 00:48.533
- THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT.
- WHAT?

00:48.533 --> 00:52.600
- THE SEX.
I FORGOT ABOUT THE SEX.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.767
- COME ON, RAY.

00:53.767 --> 00:56.100
- NO, COME ON.
WE ALWAYS HAVE GOOD-BYE SEX.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.267
IT'S GOOD LUCK.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.500
- HONEY,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.067
- SO?
I'LL--I'LL PARK THE CAR

01:00.067 --> 01:02.067
IN THE WHITE ZONE,
THEY'LL TOW IT,

01:02.067 --> 01:05.200
I'LL PAY THE FINE
WHEN I GET BACK.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.867
YOU'RE WORTH THE MONEY,
BABY.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.533
- YOU'RE GOING TO MISS
YOUR PLANE, RAY. JUST GO.

01:11.533 --> 01:13.267
- NO, COME ON.
YOU'RE WASTING TIME HERE.

01:13.267 --> 01:16.500
FIVE MINUTES,
I'LL GO FOR MY PERSONAL WORST.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.567
- THAT'S REALLY INCENTIVE,
HONEY.

01:18.567 --> 01:19.533
COULD YOU JUST GO?

01:19.533 --> 01:23.500
- YOU'RE NEVER IN THE MOOD.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.233
YOU SAID I COULD BUY
WHATEVER I NEED AT THE HOTEL.

01:32.233 --> 01:35.200
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER, RAY.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.133
- THIS TRIP'S
GOING TO STINK.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.533
- FLIGHT 32
IS NOW BOARDING.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.700
ALL PASSENGERS,
PLEASE PROCEED TO THE GATE.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.700
- [sneezes violently]

02:02.067 --> 02:04.500
I'M SORRY, MAN.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.500
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
I'M SORRY.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.567
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

02:09.567 --> 02:14.733
REALLY.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.367
- [squeals]

02:18.500 --> 02:21.467
OH, COME ON.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.767
COME ON.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

02:23.767 --> 02:26.967
KIDDING ME.
OH, GOD.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.500
OH, GOD.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.967
[spitting]

02:29.967 --> 02:32.100
[coughs]

02:32.100 --> 02:36.267
OH, COME ON!

02:36.267 --> 02:38.200
GET OUT, GET OUT!

02:38.200 --> 02:39.533
GOD, GET OFF ME!

02:39.533 --> 02:42.967
EVERYTHING IN HERE,
GET OFF ME!

02:42.967 --> 02:46.200
[groaning]

02:59.567 --> 03:02.800
DEB?
- YEAH, I'M UP HERE.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.333
- HEY.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.233
- HEY.
WELCOME HOME, RAY.

03:06.233 --> 03:10.633
- SOME GUY SNEEZED ON ME.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.700
- OH.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.233
SO DID YOU MISS ME?

03:14.233 --> 03:16.900
- I'M IN THE MEN'S ROOM
AT THE AIRPORT, RIGHT?

03:16.900 --> 03:18.333
I'M NOT
BOTHERING ANYBODY.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.667
THIS GUY--HE'S--
HE'S RIGHT IN MY FACE

03:20.667 --> 03:25.267
SNEEZING LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO BLOW OUT THE DEVIL.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.833
- OH, THAT'S GROSS.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.867
- TWO SECONDS, I'M DRIPPING
IN THIS MATERIAL

03:29.867 --> 03:32.700
FROM A-A COMPLETE STRANGER.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.833
- OHH.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.700
- YOU KNOW, YOU HEAR
ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.033
YOU JUST--YOU NEVER THINK
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

03:38.033 --> 03:39.567
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY AWFUL,
HONEY.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.800
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU FORGET, HMM?

03:42.800 --> 03:44.667
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.667
I SPENT
THE WHOLE FLIGHT--

03:49.667 --> 03:51.100
HALF THE FLIGHT,
I'M IN THE BATHROOM

03:51.100 --> 03:53.433
JUST--JUST SCRUBBING MY FACE.

03:53.433 --> 03:57.467
SEE ALL THIS SKIN?
NEW.

03:57.467 --> 03:59.333
SOMETHING'S GOT
TO BE WRONG.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.067
- YOU KNOW,
I'M SURE YOU'RE FINE, RAY.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.900
HE WAS PROBABLY
JUST SNEEZING

04:02.900 --> 04:04.900
FROM ALL
THAT DISINFECTANT

04:04.900 --> 04:10.567
THEY USE
IN THOSE BATHROOMS.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.567
- HEY, IF THERE WAS DISINFECTANT
IN THAT BATHROOM,

04:12.567 --> 04:15.667
IT WAS GETTING
ITS ASS KICKED.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.567
YOU THINK--
AM I GOING TO GET SOMETHING?

04:24.567 --> 04:25.833
- NO.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.067
- LOOK AT MY EYES.
DO THEY LOOK WATERY TO YOU?

04:28.067 --> 04:29.900
- NO, THEY LOOK FINE.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.867
BEAUTIFUL BROWN.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.000
- WHAT ABOUT THE WHITE PART?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.100
DOES IT LOOK RED

04:34.100 --> 04:36.500
OR YELLOW?

04:36.500 --> 04:39.467
- YOU KNOW, HONEY,
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED,

04:39.467 --> 04:42.233
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
DR. SUNDRAM TOMORROW?

04:42.233 --> 04:43.867
- SO YOU DO THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING?

04:43.867 --> 04:46.000
- NO, BUT--BUT IF YOU
DON'T BELIEVE ME,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.367
THEN GO SEE A DOCTOR.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.433
- YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
YEAH, I SHOULD GO.

04:50.433 --> 04:53.667
OH, MAN, I'M EXHAUSTED.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.567
- RAY, YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING

04:55.567 --> 04:57.400
THAT I'M NEVER
IN THE MOOD?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.367
- YEAH.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
OH.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.767
- NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.400
- DOES MY NECK--
DOES IT FEEL SWOLLEN THOUGH?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.833
'CAUSE--
NO, JUST ONE SIDE--

05:10.833 --> 05:12.500
ONE SIDE FEELS
A LITTLE UNEVEN.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.667
I'M JUST--I'M JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME ASPIRIN, YOU KNOW?

05:14.667 --> 05:18.467
OR MAYBE SOME
OF THAT "IBUPROFRENIAN."

05:19.367 --> 05:23.367
- I WANT CREDIT FOR THIS!

05:23.367 --> 05:26.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SHAVED MY LEGS.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.600
[kids screaming]

05:33.600 --> 05:36.467
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
THAT'S MY--

05:36.467 --> 05:39.767
THAT'S MY NIGHTIE. GIVE ME THAT!
GIVE ME THAT NIGHTIE!

05:39.767 --> 05:41.500
- BUT WE'RE A HORSY.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.067
- YOU'RE--
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

05:43.067 --> 05:46.367
WELL, YOU'RE HAVING MORE FUN
IN IT THAN I DO, SO...

05:46.367 --> 05:48.767
ALL RIGHT,
BUT SCREAM UPSTAIRS.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.600
[kids screaming]

05:51.600 --> 05:52.700
- HEY.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.100
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.767
- AWFUL.

05:55.767 --> 05:58.300
- ARE YOU SICK?
IS THAT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID?

05:58.300 --> 06:00.100
- HE'S RUNNING SOME TESTS.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.700
- WHAT KIND OF TESTS?

06:01.700 --> 06:04.267
- THE Q-TIP
IN THE THROAT THING.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.400
- HONEY,
THEY DO THAT TO EVERYBODY.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.333
ARE YOU SICK OR NOT?
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

06:08.333 --> 06:10.667
- DOCTORS.
LOOK, I KNOW HOW I FEEL.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.900
- OKAY, OKAY, SO THE DOCTOR
SAID YOU'RE FINE.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.400
- I'M NOT FINE.
I'M NOT.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.467
YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL

06:17.467 --> 06:19.667
THE DAY
BEFORE YOU GET THE FLU?

06:19.667 --> 06:22.867
WELL, THIS IS
THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.433
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

06:24.433 --> 06:27.533
I SHOULD'VE WENT
TO THE DOCTOR TOMORROW.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.500
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEN GO BACK AGAIN TOMORROW.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.333
- OH, NO WAY.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.767
I PROBABLY
CAUGHT SOMETHING

06:32.767 --> 06:35.533
FROM JUST BEING IN THAT ROOM
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

06:35.533 --> 06:39.667
IT'S LIKE A GERM CASSEROLE
IN THERE.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.633
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.067
I'M AROUND GERMS
ALL THE TIME.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.133
THE KIDS BRING
ALL KINDS OF STUFF HOME.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.800
I HARDLY EVER GET SICK.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.133
- MAYBE YOU'RE A CYBORG.

06:48.133 --> 06:50.967
- MAYBE, OR MAYBE IT'S
'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS IN HERE

06:50.967 --> 06:52.367
WASHING STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.700
MY HANDS
ARE ALWAYS CLEAN.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.867
- LET ME WASH MY HANDS.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.033
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
HONEY, YOU GOT TO USE SOAP.

07:00.033 --> 07:01.033
- SOAP, SOAP, SOAP.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.333
- USE THE SOAP THERE,

07:02.333 --> 07:04.500
AND--AND SCRUB REALLY HARD,
YOU KNOW?

07:04.500 --> 07:07.700
LIKE YOU'RE DOING A POT.
- MM-HMM.

07:07.700 --> 07:11.967
- HEY, DO THAT POT.

07:11.967 --> 07:14.500
- I DON'T WASH MY HANDS ENOUGH.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.933
- WELL, THAT--
THAT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.167
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

07:17.167 --> 07:21.167
JUST GET THE SOAP
ALL OVER THAT.

07:21.167 --> 07:25.033
HEY, AS LONG--

07:25.033 --> 07:26.600
AS LONG AS YOU ARE HOME,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.100
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE KIDS
TO THEIR PLAY DATE?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.733
- YEAH, YEAH.
LET ME JUST FINISH THIS.

07:31.733 --> 07:35.733
- OKAY.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.133
- HI, DEARS.

07:37.133 --> 07:40.167
- HEY, MARIE.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.867
- RAYMOND, I SAW YOUR CAR.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.833
WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORK?

07:49.833 --> 07:51.300
- I HAD
A DOCTOR APPOINTMENT.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.367
- YOU WENT TO THE DOCTOR
AND DIDN'T TELL ME?

07:53.367 --> 07:55.800
WHY WASN'T I TOLD?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.067
- IT'S NOTHING, MARIE.
THE DOCTOR SAID HE'S FINE.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.200
- HE'S RUNNING TESTS.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.067
- TESTS?
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:01.067 --> 08:04.033
TELL ME.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

08:04.033 --> 08:05.433
- SOME GUY SNEEZED ON ME.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.300
- WHAT? WHAT GUY?
WHO? WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

08:08.300 --> 08:10.933
- SOME GUY.
SOME GUY AT THE AIRPORT.

08:10.933 --> 08:13.333
- SOMEONE SNEEZED ON YOU
AT THE AIRPORT?

08:13.333 --> 08:19.067
YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING
FROM ANYWHERE.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.300
- OR YOU COULD HAVE NOTHING.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.200
- OH, LOOK AT THIS FACE.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.800
LOOK AT THE BLOODSHOT EYES,

08:23.800 --> 08:27.167
AND THE YELLOW SKIN,
AND THE DROOPY CHEEKS.

08:27.167 --> 08:30.633
- THAT'S HIS REGULAR FACE.

08:30.633 --> 08:31.633
- NO, NO.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.600
I HAVE BEEN FEELING
KIND OF DROOPY.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.933
- YEAH,
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID--

08:34.933 --> 08:36.133
- DOCTORS.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.167
HE NEVER HAD TO GO
TO A DOCTOR

08:37.167 --> 08:38.600
WHEN I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.633
GIVE ME YOUR HEAD.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.400
- HE'S NOT HOT, IS HE?

08:46.400 --> 08:50.067
- NOT YET,
BUT SOMETHING'S COMING.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.533
- YOU SEE THAT?

08:51.533 --> 08:54.433
I ALWAYS FEEL NORMAL
RIGHT BEFORE I GET A FEVER.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.367
- OH, THAT'S AMAZING.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.733
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.

08:57.733 --> 09:00.300
GO AHEAD, GET UP TO BED
RIGHT AWAY, YOUNG MAN.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.233
WE'RE GOING TO NIP THIS
IN THE BUD.

09:02.233 --> 09:03.833
- SHE'S RIGHT THOUGH.
I THINK SHE'S RIGHT.

09:03.833 --> 09:08.867
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT TAKING THE KIDS?

09:08.867 --> 09:13.233
- NOT IN YOUR CONDITION.

09:13.233 --> 09:14.600
ALL RIGHT,
NO MORE DISCUSSIONS.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.467
GO AHEAD. GET UP THERE.
GO, GO, GO.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.567
- I'LL JUST, YOU KNOW,
GO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

09:19.567 --> 09:20.733
AND, YOU KNOW,

09:20.733 --> 09:24.733
MAYBE YOU COULD KEEP
THE KIDS A LITTLE QUIET.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.667
- HE'S SUCH
A BRAVE LITTLE SOLDIER.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.733
- SOLDIER?
NO, HE'S A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.400
EVERY TIME
HE NICKS HIMSELF SHAVING,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.933
HE WANTS
TO CALL A PRIEST.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.967
- HE'S A SENSITIVE BOY.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.467
- MARIE, HE'S NOT SICK.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.467
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING--
THAT RAYMOND IS LYING TO ME

09:43.467 --> 09:46.367
WHEN HE TELLS ME
HE FEELS DROOPY?

09:46.367 --> 09:47.767
- YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S SICK?

09:47.767 --> 09:50.533
- MY SON TOLD ME
THAT HE DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

09:50.533 --> 09:54.333
AND I LOVE HIM, AND I'M
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.400
- AND I DON'T LOVE HIM?

10:02.833 --> 10:07.133
- I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

10:07.133 --> 10:11.733
- ALL RIGHT, MARIE.
THANK YOU.

10:17.967 --> 10:19.833
- YOU KNOW...

10:19.833 --> 10:23.633
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE A YOUNG WOMAN OF TODAY,

10:23.633 --> 10:28.600
WHAT WITH THE WOMEN'S LIB
AND ALL THAT,

10:28.600 --> 10:31.100
AND YOU PROBABLY THINK OF ME
AS A VERY OLD-FASHIONED,

10:31.100 --> 10:35.100
OUT-OF-TOUCH "HOUSEWIFE."

10:35.100 --> 10:37.433
AND MAYBE I AM,

10:37.433 --> 10:41.367
BUT IF SOMEONE
IN MY FAMILY NEEDS ME

10:41.367 --> 10:43.800
AND WANTS ME

12:30.700 --> 12:33.067
- OH, SORRY.

12:33.067 --> 12:36.933
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT YOU NEED?

12:36.933 --> 12:38.100
- HEY,

12:38.100 --> 12:41.500
COOL OFF
A LITTLE MORE, HUH?

12:41.500 --> 12:45.267

12:49.800 --> 12:51.767
[clears throat]

12:51.767 --> 12:53.700
SO WHAT ELSE?

12:53.700 --> 12:56.867
CAN I GIVE YOU
A BACK RUB OR SOMETHING?

12:56.867 --> 12:59.733
- WHAT'S THE SOMETHING?

12:59.733 --> 13:02.033

OW, OW.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.300

13:19.667 --> 13:22.467

COULD YOU CHANGE THIS BLANKET?

13:22.467 --> 13:24.600
'CAUSE THIS ONE
IS A LITTLE ITCHY.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.200

13:27.200 --> 13:29.600
- YEAH, I KNOW,
I GUESS I'M JUST, LIKE,

13:29.600 --> 13:32.967

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
- YEAH, THAT'S THE ITCHY ONE.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.000
OH, WE DON'T HAVE
THE BLUE ONE?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.733
- IT'S IN THE LAUNDRY.

13:44.733 --> 13:47.033
- OH, WELL, SHOULD I WAIT,

13:47.033 --> 13:50.867
OR IS IT NOT EVEN

13:50.867 --> 13:52.333

'CAUSE ON THE WAY OVER HERE,

14:04.233 --> 14:07.033
I WAS TRYING TO THINK
OF WHAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT.

14:07.033 --> 14:10.033
I ACTUALLY CAME UP
WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING.

14:10.033 --> 14:11.767
- WELL,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.233

14:23.533 --> 14:26.600
I SHARED A LATRINE

14:26.600 --> 14:29.767
YOU WERE LUCKY

14:31.400 --> 14:33.533
WHAT'S ON THE TUBE?

14:51.700 --> 14:53.767

14:53.767 --> 14:55.100
- YEAH, I THREW HIM A PASS.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.167
- YEAH,

14:56.167 --> 14:57.333
- NOT LOOKING?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.900
IT HIT YOU
RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.100
- CHEERED UP NOW?

15:01.100 --> 15:03.200

15:12.833 --> 15:14.433

15:38.033 --> 15:39.367
- YOU KNOW, RAY,
ARE YOU SURE PIZZA

15:39.367 --> 15:40.767
IS WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE EATING RIGHT NOW?

15:40.767 --> 15:43.333
- OH, SURE IT IS.
IT'S COMFORT FOOD.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.200
- I'LL TAKE A SLICE
OF THAT COMFORT.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.600
- SPEAKING OF COMFORT...

15:46.600 --> 15:50.000
AHH.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.467

16:16.500 --> 16:19.900
ANDY,
GET OUT OF THE BED.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.000

16:53.933 --> 16:55.667
OH.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.500
I WAS BOXING HIM OUT.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.867

YOU'RE FEELING BETTER, RAY.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.133

SO MAYBE YOU CAN START

17:13.733 --> 17:16.367

17:25.833 --> 17:27.000

17:28.800 --> 17:30.433
OH, BOYS, BOYS,

17:30.433 --> 17:33.067
YOU SHOULDN'T BE UP HERE
GETTING HIM ALL EXCITED.

17:33.067 --> 17:35.033
- IT'S OKAY, MARIE.
HE'S FINE.

17:35.033 --> 17:37.000

17:37.000 --> 17:38.567
COME ON,
I SAID GET INTO BED.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.600
- NO, MA, DEBRA ACTUALLY
THINKS THAT I SHOULD--

17:40.600 --> 17:42.333

17:42.333 --> 17:43.667
NOW GIVE ME YOUR HEAD.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.733
[kisses]

17:45.733 --> 17:48.267
THIS IS A PERSON
WHO SHOULD NOT BE STANDING.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.633
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

17:49.633 --> 17:52.100
- I COULD BAKE ZITI
ON YOUR HEAD.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.100
GO, GO.
GO LIE DOWN.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.833
- MARIE, MY GOD.
HE WAS JUST PLAYING BASKETBALL!

17:56.833 --> 17:59.033
- HOW'S YOUR THROAT?
- IT'S A LITTLE SCRATCHY.

17:59.033 --> 18:01.367
IT IS A LITTLE SCRATCHY.
- YOU SEE?

18:01.367 --> 18:03.033
AND YOU'RE GIVING HIM PIZZA?

18:03.033 --> 18:04.233
- I DIDN'T--

18:04.233 --> 18:07.600
- CHEESE IS A KNOWN
PHLEGM PRODUCER.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.467
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE THAT OUT OF HERE.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.200
- RIGHT AWAY, MRS. B.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.000
WELL,
WHERE'S YOUR BLUE BLANKET?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.233
- OH, IT'S IN THE LAUNDRY.

18:14.233 --> 18:17.167
- [clicks tongue]

18:17.167 --> 18:18.933
HERE YOU GO.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.433
NOW, I-I KNOW
YOU'RE IN PAIN,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.467
BUT I WANT YOU TO TRY
TO GET THIS ALL DOWN, OKAY?

18:22.467 --> 18:23.300
- ALL RIGHT.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.067
- JUST BREATHE IT IN.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.367
- OH, YEAH,
IT SMELLS GOOD.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.900
- THAT DOES SMELL GOOD.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.200
- SHE MAKES GOOD SOUP.
THAT'LL FIX YOU RIGHT UP.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.567
THAT STUFF
WILL GROW BACK A LIMB.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.467
- AND--
AND...

18:36.467 --> 18:38.567
WHAT ELSE DO YOU FEEL?
ARE YOU ACHY?

18:38.567 --> 18:39.567
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.200
- WHERE?
IN YOUR CHEST OR YOUR LEGS?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.667
- I--BOTH, ACTUALLY.
BOTH.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.200
- WHAT ABOUT COUGHING?
ARE YOU COUGHING?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.400
- [coughs]
A LITTLE BIT.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.500
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

18:47.500 --> 18:50.867
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.
- WHAT? WHAT?

18:50.867 --> 18:52.433
DEBRA, RAYMOND IS SICK.

18:52.433 --> 18:53.800
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
RAYMOND'S SICK.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.000
RAYMOND IS VERY SICK,
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.367
BECAUSE YOU MADE HIM SICK.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.467
YOU'RE BOTH SICK.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.367
- I AM GIVING RAYMOND
WHAT HE NEEDS.

19:03.367 --> 19:05.400
- YOU'RE GIVING RAYMOND
WHAT YOU NEED:

19:05.400 --> 19:07.467
A SICK LITTLE BOY
TO TAKE CARE OF.

19:07.467 --> 19:09.600
WELL, I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER LITTLE BOY!

19:09.600 --> 19:11.500
AND EVERY TIME
YOU COME OVER HERE,

19:11.500 --> 19:13.600
RAYMOND TAKES
ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS,

19:13.600 --> 19:18.067
AND I GOT TO WEAN HIM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:18.067 --> 19:22.467
WELL, I'M BUSY!

19:22.467 --> 19:24.533
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
THE IMPLICATION

19:24.533 --> 19:27.900
THAT I AM NOT A GOOD WIFE
AND MOTHER AND NOT NURTURING.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.200
I'M A DAMN FINE NURTURER.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.100
NOW GET OUT OF BED!

19:34.100 --> 19:36.967
AND, MARIE, YOU TAKE YOUR SOUP
AND YOUR FLOWERS

19:36.967 --> 19:38.167
AND YOUR PROBABLY
HOME-BAKED BREAD

19:38.167 --> 19:39.833
AND GET OUT OF OUR BEDROOM!

19:39.833 --> 19:41.000
[telephone rings]

19:41.000 --> 19:46.133
WHAT?
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, OKAY.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.467
THAT WAS
DR. SUNDRAM'S OFFICE.

19:47.467 --> 19:51.600
GET BACK INTO BED.
YOU GOT STREP THROAT.

20:05.033 --> 20:08.733
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.
HAVE YOUR SOUP.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.700
- WOW. STREP THROAT.
- MM-HMM.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.400
- I PROBABLY SHOULD EAT
SOME ICE CREAM, RIGHT?

20:13.400 --> 20:16.733
- OH, OF COURSE, DEAR.
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

20:20.300 --> 20:23.100
- CHOCOLATE, VANILLA,
OR STRAWBERRY?

20:24.367 --> 20:28.067
- COULD YOU MIX ALL THREE?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.633
- HEY, YOU KNOW, MA,

20:31.633 --> 20:33.800
I-I'M THINKING THAT
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE,

20:33.800 --> 20:36.167
MY THROAT'S
A LITTLE SCRATCHY TOO.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.467
- OH, HONEY,
GIVE ME YOUR HEAD.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.633
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- OKAY.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.600
YOU SIT DOWN.
I'LL GET YOU A BOWL.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.100
- [coughs softly]

20:45.100 --> 20:48.033
[coughs louder]

20:48.033 --> 20:49.667
- WHAT IS IT, GIANNI?

20:49.667 --> 20:51.833
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
HAVE SOME SOUP TOO.

20:51.833 --> 20:56.500
- OH, OKAY.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.467
- I GOT HIT IN THE FACE
WITH THE BALL TODAY.

20:58.467 --> 21:02.333
- OH, I HAVE PLENTY
OF SOUP.

21:02.333 --> 21:06.633
- I'VE HAD A PAIN IN THE ASS
FOR THE PAST 45 YEARS.

21:10.133 --> 21:14.400
YOU GOT ANY SOUP FOR THAT?

21:18.533 --> 21:19.933
- HOW'S MY BOY?

21:19.933 --> 21:20.967
- [mumbles]

21:20.967 --> 21:24.100
- LET'S SEE, ALL RIGHT?

21:27.667 --> 21:30.733
OH, NOW IT SAYS 101.

21:30.733 --> 21:34.267
THIS ONE'S
NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.733
FLIP OVER.
