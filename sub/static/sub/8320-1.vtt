01:01.074 --> 01:02.666
Oh...

01:06.612 --> 01:08.603
So you're at a movie too.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.847
What are you eating?

01:13.619 --> 01:15.917
You know the noises
people make in cinemas...

01:15.988 --> 01:19.788
eating potato chips,
crumpling wrappers.

01:22.328 --> 01:25.661
I really can't stand it...

01:38.711 --> 01:40.942
Are they good?

01:41.014 --> 01:43.778
Sure. Curry-flavored.

01:44.718 --> 01:49.178
I'll kill you if you make that noise
once the movie starts.

01:49.990 --> 01:53.448
Understand?

01:56.063 --> 01:57.462
And...

01:57.531 --> 02:01.695
I also don't like
watch alarms going off.

02:01.769 --> 02:05.671
I don't want interruptions.

02:07.207 --> 02:11.166
They say when you die
you see something like a movie.

02:11.645 --> 02:15.103
A life kaleidoscoped into a few seconds

02:15.716 --> 02:18.446
I look forward to that movie.

02:18.519 --> 02:22.922
A man's last movie. I definitely
don't want it interrupted.

02:24.858 --> 02:28.123
"Darling, don't die!" and tears...

02:28.195 --> 02:30.288
I can do without that.

02:31.098 --> 02:35.194
Hey, our movie's starting.

02:38.272 --> 02:39.933
Tsutomu Yamazaki

02:40.007 --> 02:41.634
Nobuko Miyamoto

02:41.708 --> 02:43.141
Koji Yakusho

02:50.384 --> 02:53.979
in Juzo Itami's

03:02.263 --> 03:09.669
Tampopo (Dandelion)

03:17.078 --> 03:18.909
One fine day...

03:18.980 --> 03:22.074
I went out with an old man.

03:23.718 --> 03:25.583
He's studied noodles for 40 years.

03:26.054 --> 03:29.956
He was showing me the right way
to eat them.

03:35.396 --> 03:36.624
Master...

03:36.698 --> 03:39.826
soup first or noodles first?

03:40.301 --> 03:43.134
First, observe the whole bowl.

03:44.072 --> 03:45.562
Yes, sir.

03:45.640 --> 03:51.135
Appreciate its gestalt.
Savor the aromas.

03:52.413 --> 03:56.008
Jewels of fat glittering
on the surface.

03:57.986 --> 04:00.716
Shinachiku roots shining.

04:00.788 --> 04:05.020
Seaweed slowly sinking.

04:05.093 --> 04:08.551
Spring onions floating.

04:08.630 --> 04:13.158
Concentrate on the three pork slices...

04:13.234 --> 04:17.433
They play the key role,
but stay modestly hidden.

04:18.707 --> 04:22.404
First caress the surface...

04:23.445 --> 04:29.543
with the chopstick tips.

04:31.186 --> 04:32.710
What for?

04:33.188 --> 04:36.453
To express affection.

04:36.525 --> 04:38.618
I see.

04:38.694 --> 04:42.926
Then poke the pork.

04:42.998 --> 04:44.863
Eat the pork first?

04:45.334 --> 04:47.894
No. Just touch it.

04:47.970 --> 04:51.064
Caress it with the chopstick tips.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.170
Gently pick it up...

04:53.242 --> 04:58.646
and dip it into the soup
on the right of the bowl.

04:58.714 --> 05:01.706
What's important here is to...

05:02.151 --> 05:07.612
apologize to the pork by saying...

05:08.490 --> 05:10.651
"See you soon."

05:10.726 --> 05:13.024
"See you soon"?
What a fool.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.120
What a book!

05:15.197 --> 05:17.131
Makes me hungry for noodles.

05:17.199 --> 05:19.827
Hang on. Only two more hours.

05:20.302 --> 05:22.202
Let's finish and then eat.

05:22.271 --> 05:23.966
Shall we?

05:24.039 --> 05:25.336
Keep reading.

05:26.375 --> 05:30.243
Finally start eating, the noodles first.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.450
Oh, at this time...

05:41.524 --> 05:47.656
while slurping the noodles,
look at the pork.

05:47.731 --> 05:49.460
Yes.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.031
Eye it affectionately.

05:57.307 --> 06:01.539
The old man bit some shinachiku root
and chewed it awhile.

06:02.345 --> 06:05.337
Then he took some noodles.

06:06.449 --> 06:12.854
Still chewing noodles,
he took some more shinachiku.

06:15.525 --> 06:17.857
Then he sipped some soup.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.655
Three times.

06:23.066 --> 06:24.897
He sat up...

06:28.672 --> 06:30.299
sighed, picked up...

06:30.373 --> 06:33.604
one slice of pork as if making
a major decision in life...

06:33.677 --> 06:37.875
and lightly tapped it
on the side of the bowl.

06:37.947 --> 06:39.812
What for?

06:41.151 --> 06:43.745
To drain it. That's all.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.154
Let's stop.

06:51.227 --> 06:52.126
Why?

06:54.031 --> 06:56.932
Your foolish book is making me hungry.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.595
"Lai Lai Noodle Restaurant"

07:01.238 --> 07:03.706
Looks like a naruto and noritype.

07:03.774 --> 07:05.366
Yeah, shoyu -flavored.

07:05.443 --> 07:06.808
Kind of light.

07:11.615 --> 07:13.480
Hey, what's this?

07:23.594 --> 07:25.459
You okay?

07:26.764 --> 07:28.493
Do you live here?

07:30.768 --> 07:31.962
Cheer up.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.883
Welcome.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.120
Pork in mine.

08:01.198 --> 08:02.665
Special for me.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.897
That's a bad sign.

08:06.971 --> 08:08.063
Huh?

08:08.139 --> 08:09.903
It's not boiling.

08:19.785 --> 08:22.413
Hey, kid, you'll catch cold.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.650
Oh, you're home, Tabo.

08:25.724 --> 08:28.852
What's wrong? Got beat up again?

08:30.729 --> 08:35.131
Who was it this time, Ryuta?

08:35.933 --> 08:39.734
You're soaked. Go dry and change.

08:40.405 --> 08:43.465
I'll say it again. Leave this dump.

08:44.075 --> 08:47.704
Move in with me.
That kid won't be bullied any more.

08:53.652 --> 08:55.677
Come with me to Paris.

08:56.254 --> 08:59.451
I'll buy you furs, jewelry, anything.

09:00.492 --> 09:02.926
You're so stubborn.

09:02.994 --> 09:04.427
Pork for you.

09:05.197 --> 09:06.926
Special for you.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.933
Special - like hell.

09:10.001 --> 09:11.992
Why use smelly naruto?

09:12.737 --> 09:17.800
You're out of date.
That's why business is bad.

09:17.876 --> 09:19.707
Why don't you quit?

09:19.778 --> 09:21.370
I'll help you.

09:21.446 --> 09:23.038
Shut up.

09:23.114 --> 09:25.582
What I do is my business.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.846
My shop has nothing to do with you.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.480
I'm just trying to be helpful.

09:30.857 --> 09:32.757
I'm offering to buy you out
of this crummy shop.

09:32.825 --> 09:37.091
Hey, you, be quiet.
We're trying to eat.

09:37.163 --> 09:38.391
Stay out of this.

09:38.464 --> 09:40.398
Hey, Ken.
I'm sorry.

09:40.466 --> 09:44.869
Stop it, Pisken.
Leave my customers alone.

09:44.937 --> 09:46.666
Customer!

09:47.073 --> 09:50.065
You don't need smelly truck drivers.

09:50.142 --> 09:51.541
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

09:55.715 --> 09:57.114
Hey, man.

09:57.183 --> 09:59.344
If you want to fight, try me.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.054
Okay, I think I will.

10:16.602 --> 10:18.263
Take the truck, Gun.

10:18.337 --> 10:19.269
But...

10:19.338 --> 10:22.205
I'm okay. Go ahead.
They're waiting.

10:24.577 --> 10:26.169
Okay. Good luck.

10:42.695 --> 10:45.255
Let's go outside.

11:43.623 --> 11:44.920
Good morning.

11:45.859 --> 11:47.588
Morning.

11:47.961 --> 11:49.121
Ouch.

11:49.963 --> 11:51.897
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

11:51.965 --> 11:53.762
How did I end up here?

11:53.834 --> 11:55.734
Don't you remember?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.963
I tried to put you to bed.

11:58.038 --> 12:00.006
But you wouldn't move.

12:40.848 --> 12:42.338
You fight good.

12:42.417 --> 12:44.885
No. I got beaten up.

12:44.952 --> 12:46.579
That's okay.

12:46.654 --> 12:49.122
There were five of them.
That's not fair.

12:49.190 --> 12:51.351
- Do you win?
- No, not me.

12:51.426 --> 12:52.916
Do you lose?

12:52.994 --> 12:55.053
Always. There are three of them.

12:55.129 --> 12:57.029
Ryuta, Yohei and Uchida.

12:57.098 --> 12:59.032
Three? That's not fair.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.034
But I don't run.

13:01.102 --> 13:03.969
A man should never run,
my dad used to say.

13:04.038 --> 13:05.835
Your dad was tough.

13:05.907 --> 13:07.807
Yes, and Mom is great too.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.866
She's a good cook.

13:13.081 --> 13:16.676
Yes. Haven't had
such good pickles in years.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.616
The best pickles in Japan.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.013
Her noodles too.

13:21.522 --> 13:24.788
Her noodles?
Her noodles are, well...

13:24.860 --> 13:27.385
I've got to go.

13:27.463 --> 13:28.930
- Got your notebook?
- Yes.

13:28.997 --> 13:30.521
- Pen?
- Yes.

13:30.599 --> 13:32.362
Is the denominator top or bottom?

13:32.434 --> 13:35.096
Top, of course.
I know more math than you do.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.762
Or is it?

13:36.839 --> 13:38.500
No. It's the bottom one. Bye.

13:38.574 --> 13:40.007
Leave his hat!

13:47.783 --> 13:50.479
Were my noodles that bad?

13:50.552 --> 13:53.180
No, I didn't mean that.

13:53.255 --> 13:55.587
Please. Be honest.

13:56.225 --> 13:59.683
Since my husband died,
I've been trying so hard.

13:59.761 --> 14:03.253
But I'm not confident. I'm never sure.

14:05.033 --> 14:07.467
Please tell me the truth.

14:09.638 --> 14:11.503
Oh, I haven't even told you my name.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.809
I'm Tampopo.

14:14.877 --> 14:16.777
- I'm Goro.
- My name is Gun.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.781
So, how are my noodles?

14:22.451 --> 14:23.941
Well...

14:24.019 --> 14:29.582
They've got sincerity,
but they lack guts, they're...

14:29.658 --> 14:31.250
Frankly, they're bad.

14:33.662 --> 14:35.323
Uh, Miss Tampopo.

14:35.397 --> 14:37.297
- No. Just Tampopo.
- Okay, Tampopo.

14:37.366 --> 14:39.027
Go make noodles.

14:39.101 --> 14:40.592
- Gun, you're the customer.
- Okay.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.365
No. Come in the door.

14:42.438 --> 14:44.303
Okay? We'll give it a try.

14:44.841 --> 14:48.641
Ready? Go!

14:50.747 --> 14:52.374
- Welcome!
- Stop!

14:52.448 --> 14:54.382
If you say "welcome," look at him.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.247
- If not, just keep working.
- Yes, sir.

14:56.319 --> 14:57.479
Carry on.

14:58.221 --> 14:59.552
Plain noodles.

14:59.622 --> 15:03.991
Now, look at the customer
while he's not looking.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.789
Wait a minute.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.463
What did you see?

15:12.535 --> 15:15.868
- He's young and cute...
- No, no. That's not the point.

15:16.239 --> 15:19.037
Is he in a hurry? Is he hungry?

15:19.108 --> 15:20.871
Is he a new customer?

15:20.944 --> 15:22.468
Is he drunk?

15:22.545 --> 15:26.106
- Is he a customer you want?
- I see.

15:26.182 --> 15:27.774
Now fix the noodles.

15:35.158 --> 15:37.092
Cutting the pork there is good.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.923
That's how my husband did it.

15:38.995 --> 15:41.156
- The slices are too thick.
- But thicker is better.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.892
No, not at all.

15:42.966 --> 15:44.831
Three 3mm slices are best.

15:47.904 --> 15:50.702
- No. That's too thin.
- I see.

16:00.217 --> 16:02.515
Now, quick,
look at the customer!

16:03.220 --> 16:06.815
Don't you want to see how he reacts?

16:06.890 --> 16:08.551
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

16:08.626 --> 16:10.821
- What's he doing?
- Sipping soup.

16:10.894 --> 16:12.623
Isn't that strange?

16:13.397 --> 16:17.527
- Well...
- It's very strange.

16:17.601 --> 16:22.231
How could he sip the soup?
It's supposed to be boiling hot.

16:22.306 --> 16:23.398
I see.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.101
- A fatal flaw!
- Yes, sir.

16:25.175 --> 16:27.006
- The soup must be hot.
- Yes, sir.

16:32.082 --> 16:33.982
Wait. Wait, please...

16:34.051 --> 16:35.313
Please...

16:35.386 --> 16:37.081
Please be my teacher.

16:37.154 --> 16:38.678
Teacher?

16:38.756 --> 16:41.691
Please. I'll be a good student.

16:41.759 --> 16:47.061
Meeting you makes me want
to be a real noodle cook.

16:47.598 --> 16:50.692
For my son too.

16:50.768 --> 16:54.602
I'll do anything.
So please, please teach me.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.736
Teach you? But we're...

16:57.808 --> 16:59.673
Only when you're free.

17:00.377 --> 17:03.471
I'll keep pickles ready for you.

17:05.082 --> 17:07.448
One, two! One, two!

17:07.518 --> 17:09.247
"Closed Today"

17:11.954 --> 17:13.319
Come on!

17:13.390 --> 17:14.880
Don't be such a weakling.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.689
One, two! One, two!

17:28.506 --> 17:30.269
Okay, ladle the noodles out.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.139
Into six bowls.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.007
Get set. Go!

17:38.416 --> 17:40.077
Faster.

17:44.556 --> 17:46.615
What's that? Put it back.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.556
- Keep going.
- Yes, sir.

17:49.394 --> 17:51.419
Get set! Go!

17:55.900 --> 17:58.300
Get set! Go!

18:23.962 --> 18:26.658
Almost there!
3 minutes 15 seconds.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.596
- You have to beat 3 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.264
Come on!
It takes muscles!

18:35.341 --> 18:36.933
Don't give up!

18:37.009 --> 18:39.239
You must be better than a man.

18:39.311 --> 18:40.903
Go! Go! Go!

18:41.714 --> 18:45.013
Okay, now some stretching exercises.

18:56.028 --> 18:58.155
Why am I doing this?

19:36.235 --> 19:38.430
This place is famous for seafood.

20:27.654 --> 20:29.622
Your order, sir?

20:33.860 --> 20:35.623
What would you like, sir?

20:35.695 --> 20:37.560
Just a moment.

20:38.798 --> 20:40.732
And you, sir?

20:40.800 --> 20:45.464
I'm not too hungry. Something light.

20:45.539 --> 20:48.167
Let me see...

20:53.313 --> 20:55.975
Sole meuniere, please.

20:56.383 --> 20:58.146
Some soup or salad, sir?

20:58.218 --> 21:00.448
Consomme. No salad.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.317
- A drink, sir?
- Beer.

21:02.389 --> 21:04.357
- Heineken.
- Yes, sir.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.291
And you, sir?

21:11.365 --> 21:13.230
I'll have sole too.

21:14.802 --> 21:16.429
Soup or a salad, sir?

21:16.504 --> 21:19.234
Consomme. No salad.

21:19.307 --> 21:21.639
- Something to drink, sir?
- Beer too.

21:26.581 --> 21:28.105
And you, sir?

21:28.182 --> 21:29.376
Well...

21:29.450 --> 21:31.577
Maybe I'll try the sole, too.

21:31.652 --> 21:33.711
- Soup or salad, sir?
- Well...

21:33.788 --> 21:35.415
Maybe consommé.

21:35.489 --> 21:37.514
- A drink, sir?
- Well...

21:38.292 --> 21:40.192
Maybe a beer.

21:45.499 --> 21:47.160
Same for me.

21:47.234 --> 21:48.701
Me, too.

21:56.243 --> 21:57.710
Sir?

22:00.915 --> 22:02.815
- And you, sir?
- One moment.

22:10.124 --> 22:11.716
So you have quenelle.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.963
Boudin style...

22:18.466 --> 22:22.402
That's quenelle prepared
in the shape of sausage?

22:22.470 --> 22:23.459
Yes, sir.

22:24.805 --> 22:29.038
I think Taille-Vent in France
serves this.

22:29.111 --> 22:30.772
You're well-informed.

22:30.846 --> 22:33.212
Our chef trained at Taille-Vent.

22:34.416 --> 22:36.350
Then it's served with caviar sauce?

22:36.418 --> 22:38.010
That's correct, sir.

22:39.521 --> 22:43.855
And the escargots wrapped in pastry.

22:44.559 --> 22:46.356
In fond-de-veau?

22:46.428 --> 22:50.922
Yes. Escargots and mushrooms
simmered in Madeira.

22:50.999 --> 22:53.399
And then stewed in fond-de-veau, sir.

22:53.468 --> 22:55.368
Yes. I'll have that.

22:55.437 --> 22:59.737
And apple-and-walnut salad.

22:59.808 --> 23:01.935
A perfect match, sir.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.944
A drink, sir?

23:04.012 --> 23:06.003
Yes.

23:06.314 --> 23:10.717
I think I feel like
some Corton Charlemagne.

23:14.122 --> 23:15.487
Do you have a 1981?

23:15.557 --> 23:17.616
I'll call the sommelier.

23:18.927 --> 23:20.485
Thank you.

24:02.739 --> 24:07.870
You use grated cheese
only on certain spaghetti dishes.

24:07.944 --> 24:12.142
This is spaghetti alle vongole. So...?

24:13.316 --> 24:15.841
That's right, no cheese.

24:15.918 --> 24:18.250
Fork and spoon, everybody.

24:19.989 --> 24:22.719
Spoon in your left hand.

24:23.126 --> 24:30.157
Catch three or four strings
of spaghetti with your fork...

24:30.233 --> 24:34.431
and gently turn it around on your spoon.

24:35.204 --> 24:37.764
You wind your spaghetti like this.

24:38.141 --> 24:43.010
And eat it silently.

24:57.393 --> 25:02.456
Never make any noise.

25:07.404 --> 25:09.804
No noise, whatsoever.

25:10.274 --> 25:15.678
Listen carefully to hear
if you make any noise.

25:16.847 --> 25:22.308
Sometimes people
don't know they make noise.

25:22.686 --> 25:24.244
Let's try it.

25:24.321 --> 25:26.346
Listen carefully.

25:30.661 --> 25:34.358
Even a very faint noise...

25:42.472 --> 25:47.739
...like this is taboo abroad.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.073
This shop is so near to yours...

29:06.546 --> 29:08.537
but look at the queue.

29:09.115 --> 29:12.141
If your noodles are good, you'll get
all the customers you want.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.947
That's right.

29:14.287 --> 29:17.916
This place is not so great.

29:18.358 --> 29:20.758
You've eaten here before?

29:20.827 --> 29:22.852
No, I can just tell.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.628
See? Too much wasted motion.

29:28.701 --> 29:32.535
And they talk too much.
Only their "welcome" has clout.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.800
Who ordered pork and wonton dumplings?

29:34.874 --> 29:37.172
See? They can't remember
who ordered what.

29:37.644 --> 29:39.509
You can beat them in a month.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.843
Tampopo, look.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.184
Watch closely.

29:49.923 --> 29:52.255
See how he changes the water.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.191
See how they switch positions?

29:55.261 --> 29:56.922
No wasted motion.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.031
And they're quiet too.

30:01.034 --> 30:04.765
This is a good place.

30:04.838 --> 30:07.102
Their customers feel good too.

30:07.173 --> 30:11.701
See? They keep on drinking
right down to the last drop.

30:13.413 --> 30:17.475
Look, when they return their bowls.

30:18.085 --> 30:21.452
Watch closely. The old man looks at
every empty bowl...

30:22.756 --> 30:26.214
to see if the soup is finished.

30:29.163 --> 30:31.188
It's the soup that animates the noodles.

30:31.265 --> 30:34.234
That's why he checks so carefully.

30:35.369 --> 30:41.399
He remembers exactly who orders
what and when.

30:41.475 --> 30:43.238
Right?

30:43.310 --> 30:45.505
That's part of being good.

30:47.548 --> 30:49.880
Another train just arrived. Watch...

30:54.221 --> 30:55.654
With pork.

30:57.858 --> 30:59.826
Plain noodles. No bean sprouts.

31:01.529 --> 31:03.121
With dumplings.

31:03.764 --> 31:05.356
Extra noodles.

31:07.268 --> 31:09.168
Shinachiku noodles, please.

31:09.236 --> 31:10.726
Garlic noodles.

31:10.804 --> 31:12.396
I want soft noodles.

31:13.874 --> 31:15.341
How much?

31:16.777 --> 31:18.472
480 yen.

31:20.481 --> 31:21.641
Thanks.

31:23.217 --> 31:25.208
Great, isn't he?

31:26.954 --> 31:29.650
See? He knows exactly who ordered what.

31:29.957 --> 31:32.892
I want fatty pork in mine.

31:33.662 --> 31:35.391
Here's my money.

31:40.001 --> 31:41.935
Plain, with firm noodles.

31:45.941 --> 31:47.966
Plain but no shinachiku.

31:48.610 --> 31:52.011
I can remember.
That guy ordered the pork noodles.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.538
And that guy gets straight noodles,
without bean sprouts.

31:55.617 --> 31:59.678
And he gets the large noodles, but...

31:59.754 --> 32:01.551
- Uh...
- What?

32:01.623 --> 32:05.024
The dumplings guy gets served
before Mr. Big Noodles.

32:05.093 --> 32:07.152
- Is that right?
- Yes.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.753
With dumplings.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.024
Large noodles.

32:10.098 --> 32:11.895
Shinachiku noodles.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.764
Garlic noodles.

32:13.835 --> 32:15.666
Soft noodles.
Fatty pork.

32:15.737 --> 32:17.068
Firm noodles.

32:17.138 --> 32:18.867
No shinachiku.

32:42.731 --> 32:47.065
This is it. This is it!

32:51.407 --> 32:54.808
Excuse me. Please!

32:54.877 --> 32:58.540
Please tell me your soup recipe.

32:58.614 --> 33:01.583
How to make my soup? Never!

33:01.984 --> 33:05.511
You're a professional.
I can tell by your eyes.

33:05.588 --> 33:08.455
I don't tell competitors my secrets.

33:08.524 --> 33:11.357
Please. I'll pay you for it.

33:13.663 --> 33:15.153
How much?

33:15.231 --> 33:17.165
Uh, 50,000 yen or so.

33:17.233 --> 33:18.598
Never!

33:18.668 --> 33:22.399
If you want to pay money,
you loan me one million yen...

33:22.471 --> 33:24.530
to be paid back in a year,
no interest...

33:24.607 --> 33:28.566
then I'll tell you
the secret of my soup free.

33:29.545 --> 33:31.410
One million yen...

33:35.751 --> 33:39.312
Don't lend him anything.

33:39.755 --> 33:43.782
He's crazy about the horses.
You'll never get it back.

33:44.927 --> 33:49.591
You give me 30,000 yen.
I give you the secret of his soup.

33:50.166 --> 33:53.465
My shop is next door.

33:53.536 --> 33:57.063
Tonight come back with the money.

34:10.887 --> 34:12.047
Hello.

34:25.735 --> 34:27.067
Come this way.

34:27.637 --> 34:30.197
- Where to?
- This way. This way.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.609
Where are we going?

34:34.143 --> 34:35.577
There, there.

34:37.481 --> 34:39.277
What's happening?

34:39.349 --> 34:41.612
You can't learn soup-making here.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.520
Look through here.

35:58.629 --> 36:00.062
How much?

36:03.067 --> 36:06.764
Hey, why didn't you finish it?

36:06.838 --> 36:08.635
Sorry, but I'm full.

36:08.706 --> 36:12.972
What? Why did you order it
if you're not hungry, you jerks?

36:15.513 --> 36:17.879
You're from Lai Lai, aren't you?

36:18.182 --> 36:22.949
Why did you come here? To steal
our secrets, you lousy bastards!

36:25.122 --> 36:28.717
We've been in this business
for 40 years.

36:29.026 --> 36:33.622
We don't need comments from beginners.

36:34.365 --> 36:36.458
Apologize right now.

36:36.801 --> 36:39.793
Or finish every drop of our soup
before you go.

36:45.043 --> 36:48.240
Now we can't leave
without a last word, can we?

36:48.747 --> 36:53.184
I didn't finish the soup
because I couldn't. It stinks!

36:53.252 --> 36:55.345
How dare you!

36:55.420 --> 36:58.651
The soup tastes like
overcooked pork bones.

36:59.091 --> 37:03.050
The vegetables you use to hide
the pork stink are too sweet.

37:03.629 --> 37:05.563
The kombu is too strong.

37:05.631 --> 37:08.759
Yeah, and you use
dried seguro sardines.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.564
Those fish are not fit to eat.
Their innards stink.

37:11.904 --> 37:13.166
How dare you!

37:13.238 --> 37:18.505
You stupid amateurs could never
appreciate my noodles!

37:18.577 --> 37:22.013
But people who eat noodles
are all amateurs.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.514
So why make noodles amateurs
can't appreciate?

37:24.583 --> 37:29.213
She's right. You let the dough sit
too long. It smells like soda.

37:29.288 --> 37:32.052
After it rains, go easy on the soda.

37:32.124 --> 37:34.251
And your overcooked pork is
like cardboard.

37:34.326 --> 37:38.786
Your shinachiku aren't pickled.
So they're soggy and bland.

37:40.899 --> 37:46.064
You goddamn big mouths!
You think you make better noodles!

37:47.539 --> 37:50.201
We just make normal noodles
in a normal way.

37:50.275 --> 37:54.177
Okay. We'll come try
your normal noodles.

37:54.746 --> 37:57.146
We'll be there in the morning.

37:57.983 --> 38:00.451
It'd better be good, or else.

38:08.194 --> 38:10.719
The pork is okay. Is the water boiling?

38:10.797 --> 38:11.764
Here.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.128
How's the soup?

38:15.602 --> 38:17.399
- Oh, God!
- What's wrong?

38:17.470 --> 38:18.801
I let the soup boil.

38:18.871 --> 38:20.736
- It's not clear.
- What can we do?

38:23.610 --> 38:26.272
- They're coming.
- Mom, they're here!

38:34.921 --> 38:40.120
Okay, let's have some of
your normal noodles.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.058
- Wait a minute.
- Wait?

38:43.429 --> 38:45.260
It won't take long.

38:45.331 --> 38:50.098
No, we want it now.
A promise is a promise. Get moving.

38:51.671 --> 38:53.263
What's that smell?

38:55.742 --> 38:58.233
Let me see the soup.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.773
Leave my mom alone!

39:10.823 --> 39:12.814
Don't! Stop it!

39:14.260 --> 39:16.125
Goro!

39:18.731 --> 39:20.062
Help!

39:20.133 --> 39:21.863
Goro, help!

39:40.220 --> 39:41.653
Oh, damn it!

40:01.709 --> 40:03.472
"Closed Today"

40:03.544 --> 40:05.910
Closed again, eh?

40:06.847 --> 40:09.407
It's not good for business.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.388
So you still can't get the soup right.

40:18.659 --> 40:20.718
We'll just have to ask the old master.

40:23.701 --> 40:26.363
Goro, we're over here.
Come join us.

40:26.937 --> 40:28.529
There they are.

40:29.974 --> 40:31.498
Come on.

40:34.979 --> 40:37.413
Hello, hello.

40:38.849 --> 40:40.841
Come on.

40:43.055 --> 40:44.522
Hey!

40:45.524 --> 40:47.253
Come here.

40:52.597 --> 40:54.462
Come share our meal.

41:00.205 --> 41:02.605
This is our master.
He was a doctor.

41:02.674 --> 41:04.767
While he was selling noodles for fun...

41:04.843 --> 41:09.303
...his partner stole his wife
and practice.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.875
Now he's our resident gourmet.

41:13.719 --> 41:15.983
Nice to meet you.

41:16.054 --> 41:17.885
You came just in time.

41:17.956 --> 41:21.619
We just got our hands on some of
Carlton's boeuf bourgignon.

41:23.261 --> 41:26.196
It's slightly burnt,
so you can't call it perfect.

41:26.565 --> 41:30.501
French cooking is a constant battle
with burns.

41:32.604 --> 41:34.037
Ummm. Good.

41:35.807 --> 41:39.072
How's the sake?
Pretty good, isn't it?

41:39.878 --> 41:43.473
Yeah. But what is it?
I can't tell the brand.

41:45.150 --> 41:48.483
No, you can't. It's a blend.

41:48.553 --> 41:51.920
The base is a semi-dry Nada.

41:52.457 --> 41:54.755
But we blended it quite a bit.

41:54.826 --> 41:57.921
He's been studying this for 15 years.

41:58.431 --> 42:03.596
It's a pork cutlet from Kitaro.
But I can't recommend it.

42:03.669 --> 42:05.796
Their quality has gone down.

42:06.205 --> 42:11.074
They used to use good pork
from Kagoshima. But not now.

42:13.212 --> 42:16.978
Now they even use machines
to shred cabbage.

42:17.049 --> 42:19.381
No more soul in their food.

42:19.452 --> 42:22.421
It used to be good, though.

42:22.488 --> 42:24.888
They tend to be fussy.

42:24.957 --> 42:28.825
What's the story about this wine?

42:29.362 --> 42:32.695
You mean this Medoc,
a 1980 Chateau Pichon Lalande.

42:36.769 --> 42:44.335
The weather was bad in 1980,
and it was a bad year for Bordeaux.

42:46.245 --> 42:49.373
The other day I was in the alley
behind Chat Qui Peche...

42:49.449 --> 42:51.883
and found some empty bottles...

42:51.951 --> 42:56.752
including this particular
Chateau Pichon Lalande.

42:57.223 --> 43:01.489
There was still 5cm left.

43:01.561 --> 43:05.463
So I brought it home and decanted it.

43:07.033 --> 43:09.729
It's a real find.

43:13.206 --> 43:17.007
Light but firm...

43:17.644 --> 43:22.980
The tail that trailed down my throat
was so long.

43:26.253 --> 43:30.280
They live deeply, these vagabonds.

43:30.357 --> 43:33.326
You're not eating much, sonny.
Can I fix you something?

43:33.393 --> 43:35.884
What do you want?

43:35.963 --> 43:38.454
- A rice omelet.
- Rice omelet. Hmm.

43:38.532 --> 43:40.523
Okay, follow me.

46:20.529 --> 46:22.793
We want to borrow your master
for a while.

46:22.865 --> 46:24.526
So long.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.727
I'm so grateful, master.

46:26.802 --> 46:28.292
Good luck.

46:28.370 --> 46:31.168
Why don't we sing our master off.

46:37.212 --> 46:45.142
How precious

46:47.322 --> 46:53.750
Our teacher's teachings

46:56.932 --> 47:05.271
Time flies swiftly

47:07.976 --> 47:15.440
In this garden of learning

47:16.786 --> 47:25.717
So swiftly

47:27.931 --> 47:34.427
After all these years

47:38.842 --> 47:50.447
We must part

47:52.555 --> 47:59.051
Goodbye

49:51.109 --> 49:52.667
What did you catch?

49:52.744 --> 49:53.904
Oysters.

49:54.212 --> 49:55.736
Let me see.

50:09.127 --> 50:10.992
Sell me one.

50:12.097 --> 50:13.394
Sure.

50:14.099 --> 50:15.657
Shall I open it?

50:42.961 --> 50:43.723
Ouch!

51:04.450 --> 51:06.042
Here, let me help.

51:13.626 --> 51:15.321
It tickles.

52:40.647 --> 52:42.512
Anesthetic.

53:54.188 --> 53:56.088
God, what a huge abscess.

53:56.157 --> 53:58.751
What a stink. Didn't you smell it?

53:59.460 --> 54:01.291
A little bit.

54:01.362 --> 54:03.728
Whew! I thought I'd vomit.

54:05.533 --> 54:07.330
You can eat anything now.

54:07.401 --> 54:09.426
But start with something soft.

54:22.850 --> 54:24.442
"I only eat natural food"

54:29.023 --> 54:31.355
"Do not give me sweets or snacks"

54:31.425 --> 54:33.290
"A message from my mother"

54:41.636 --> 54:44.332
Do you want this?

54:51.345 --> 54:53.438
It's good.

54:54.415 --> 54:56.007
Here.

55:18.974 --> 55:20.271
Listen carefully.

55:20.342 --> 55:26.770
Noodles are synergetic things.
Every step must be perfectly built.

55:28.250 --> 55:30.150
Don't forget that.

55:30.219 --> 55:35.384
Let's review the basic rules of soup.

55:35.457 --> 55:40.918
Fowl spoils quickly.
So use only the freshest chicken.

55:40.996 --> 55:47.196
Both chicken and pork have strong
smells. So parboil them first.

55:47.269 --> 55:51.035
Then rinse them well in cold water.

55:51.106 --> 55:54.200
Don't cut the vegetables.

55:55.077 --> 55:57.204
The main point is heat.

55:57.746 --> 56:00.544
Heat releases the soul
of the ingredients.

56:00.616 --> 56:05.349
But never allow it to come
to a full boil like that.

56:06.021 --> 56:08.956
If you boil it,
the soup will never clear.

56:09.958 --> 56:16.091
And keep skimming the scum off.

56:18.801 --> 56:22.635
Today I have
a most interesting addition.

56:22.939 --> 56:25.533
Isn't he beautiful?

56:26.576 --> 56:28.009
This is...

56:46.996 --> 56:51.592
Sorry. It's just the way
it looked at me.

56:52.135 --> 56:56.629
Here's your 14 servings
of mori noodles.

57:06.582 --> 57:08.379
Welcome!

57:08.451 --> 57:10.442
How nice to see you, sir.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.421
Please, come this way.

57:32.810 --> 57:34.869
No shiroko, darling.

57:34.945 --> 57:37.072
Or kamonamban
or tempura soba either.

57:37.147 --> 57:39.809
They almost got you last time.

57:39.883 --> 57:41.817
I'm just going to the bank now.

57:41.885 --> 57:43.614
Come, Shohei.

58:03.273 --> 58:05.070
One kamonamban here.

58:05.142 --> 58:07.007
One tempura soba here.

58:07.378 --> 58:10.279
And one shiruko. All for you.

01:00:10.135 --> 01:00:12.569
Turn him upside down.

01:00:33.726 --> 01:00:36.024
Good, we've done it.

01:00:51.877 --> 01:00:55.472
In thanks for saving my life...

01:00:56.148 --> 01:01:02.144
I'd like to treat you to
some special suppon.

01:01:04.557 --> 01:01:07.549
Just a touch more salt today,
Shohei.

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:08.991
Yes, sir.

01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:10.653
Want to watch?

01:01:18.504 --> 01:01:20.096
Is it from Lake Hamana?

01:01:20.172 --> 01:01:23.403
No, the Kuma River.
Finally I got a wild one.

01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:26.978
Watch out, ma'am.

01:01:27.047 --> 01:01:30.039
Be careful.
Suppon have teeth like razors.

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:33.477
They can bite your finger clean off.

01:01:43.063 --> 01:01:46.464
See that?
Unless you kill it in one stroke...

01:01:46.533 --> 01:01:50.970
the muscles contract, the blood
congeals and it won't taste as good.

01:01:58.745 --> 01:02:05.378
Since my rescuer is having trouble,
I feel I must do something.

01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:10.614
Will you let this old man help?

01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:12.351
Shohei, come here!

01:02:12.425 --> 01:02:15.656
Yes, sir.
Nothing special, but...

01:02:15.729 --> 01:02:18.197
please sample my noodles.

01:02:31.845 --> 01:02:34.405
Where did you acquire such skill?

01:02:34.481 --> 01:02:39.316
When I was young, an old man
at the local noodle stand taught me.

01:02:41.921 --> 01:02:46.291
What do you think?
If he'll be of use, take him.

01:02:46.894 --> 01:02:52.594
Today we start making Lai Lai
a "three-star" noodle joint.

01:02:55.002 --> 01:02:57.163
Master, you handle the soup.

01:02:57.805 --> 01:03:03.607
Shohei, starting today,
you're responsible for the noodles.

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:09.744
Gun and myself, we will take charge
of the atmosphere.

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:14.718
We will create rich depth and
a clear, shoyu -flavored soup.

01:03:15.056 --> 01:03:20.494
We'll only add roast pork,
shinachiku roots and spring onions.

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:26.591
The menu will only offer
plain noodles and pork noodles.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:27.759
Agreed?

01:03:27.835 --> 01:03:29.200
Agreed!

01:03:31.105 --> 01:03:33.096
What about a new name?

01:03:33.574 --> 01:03:37.442
Since the noodles will change,
maybe we should change the name.

01:03:37.511 --> 01:03:40.503
- Right.
- Let's.

01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:41.980
Yes, let's.

01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:45.212
Any good ideas?

01:03:45.286 --> 01:03:47.880
- Something different.
- Easy to say.

01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:50.287
- Feminine too.
- And taste-tempting.

01:03:50.357 --> 01:03:51.381
Uh...

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.191
Why not Tampopo.

01:03:56.263 --> 01:03:58.458
Tampopo! Yes!

01:03:58.532 --> 01:04:00.329
- Clever.
- Not bad at all.

01:04:01.168 --> 01:04:02.363
Tampopo...

01:04:02.437 --> 01:04:06.498
Yeah, Tampopo Noodles.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.544
Tampopo Noodles!

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:24.983
"Tampopo"

01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:40.037
Take a look. Chicken, pork,
kombu and dried sardines.

01:04:40.108 --> 01:04:44.010
Unusual. They use fish heads too.

01:05:19.648 --> 01:05:23.085
The noodles are superb.
So smooth, but with great body.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:30.282
You're right. Smooth but strong.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.529
Noodles can be so different.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.403
When you make noodles,
you must have a precise recipe.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.962
An exact combination of different
flours, kneadings, everything.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:52.277
To make noodles this smooth,
they must do an extra rolling.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:56.609
They probably let the dough sit
before they roll it.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:06:03.319
But the key question is
exactly how long.

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:07.522
The soda water may be
a bit different too.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:09.929
I'll ask.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:11.796
They'll never tell you.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.631
It won't hurt to try.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.971
Say, did you make the noodles
I just had?

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.406
Yes, I did.

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.309
They weren't as good as usual.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.273
No good?

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.585
They're the same as always.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.494
Maybe you didn't let the dough sit
long enough.

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:44.660
Nonsense! I kneaded it yesterday,
and let it sit overnight.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:48.694
Strange. Maybe you skipped a rolling.

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.706
No. Three times, as usual.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.674
Did you change the soda water?

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:56.611
No. I use the very best soda water,
the same as back home in Guangxi.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.117
No. 1 Chinese Spring Water
from Guangxi.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:03.914
Really? Maybe it was just me.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.249
It must be.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:07.415
Thank you!

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:44.753
Hey, I hear you're hanging out
at Tampopo's place these days.

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.557
Listen, big-mouth.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:50.233
It's none of your business
where I hang out.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.165
I guess not.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.702
Got a minute?

01:07:57.575 --> 01:08:01.102
Last time I was drunk so I forgot
to stop my boys from helping.

01:08:01.179 --> 01:08:03.670
Basically I'm a fair guy.

01:08:04.449 --> 01:08:08.351
I felt bad about it.
Probably worse than you did.

01:08:09.887 --> 01:08:14.483
What do you say?
How about fighting one-on-one now?

01:09:13.384 --> 01:09:15.376
Oh? You changed the noodles.

01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:17.746
The soup's new too.

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:19.791
You noticed? How is it?

01:09:19.858 --> 01:09:21.519
Pretty good.

01:09:21.593 --> 01:09:22.752
Right?

01:10:09.775 --> 01:10:11.766
You okay?

01:10:12.211 --> 01:10:17.205
Yeah. You're pretty good.

01:10:18.784 --> 01:10:22.777
A long time ago I boxed welterweight.

01:10:25.124 --> 01:10:29.288
That's not fair. I thought
your left hook was too good.

01:10:29.361 --> 01:10:31.955
Yours is fast too.

01:10:40.406 --> 01:10:43.466
Are you sweet on Tampopo?

01:10:44.344 --> 01:10:49.304
I just want to make
her place a good one.

01:10:51.885 --> 01:10:53.853
Let me help.

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:56.851
What can you do?

01:10:56.923 --> 01:11:00.188
I'm a contractor. I do interiors too.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.988
Bars and nightclubs mostly.

01:11:04.063 --> 01:11:06.964
Okay. You do the interior.

01:11:07.033 --> 01:11:08.933
I'll do my best.

01:11:09.002 --> 01:11:12.028
Make sure she pays for it, okay?

01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:17.100
Okay. My name is Pisken.

01:11:21.047 --> 01:11:22.480
I'm Goro.

01:11:41.067 --> 01:11:44.195
Oh, no! Not again!

01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:46.329
Relax. He's going to redecorate.

01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:50.070
That's why I brought him.

01:11:51.178 --> 01:11:52.975
Really? Pisken will?

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:55.379
I like the name Tampopo. It'll do.

01:11:55.449 --> 01:12:00.352
We grew up together, you know.
I'll do my best.

01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:01.786
Thanks.

01:12:01.855 --> 01:12:04.415
Do you have any savings?

01:12:04.491 --> 01:12:06.982
A million yen.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:11.225
It'll cost two million.

01:12:11.298 --> 01:12:13.232
That's more than I have.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.895
If you sell 200 bowls and net 200 yen
each, you'll make 40,000 yen a day.

01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:19.235
A million a month.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:24.034
You can pay me in no time.

01:12:24.111 --> 01:12:29.139
We'll rebuild all these
to fit the lady's size.

01:12:30.251 --> 01:12:32.685
Hey, Goro. Give me a bowl.

01:12:34.188 --> 01:12:36.418
This is too high.

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.618
The counter is too narrow.

01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:43.656
Noodles need the right space too.

01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:45.892
You need 40cm.

01:12:45.966 --> 01:12:49.595
But make it 45cm to be safe.

01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:08.169
Out of my way!

01:13:08.244 --> 01:13:10.041
She's just fine as she is.

01:13:10.113 --> 01:13:13.139
- What are you doing, you idiot?
- I'm no idiot.

01:13:13.216 --> 01:13:15.480
Can't you see. She needs
redecorating, too.

01:13:15.551 --> 01:13:17.451
Don't bother! She's fine as she is.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.612
But...

01:13:18.688 --> 01:13:22.419
She's pretty enough.

01:13:22.492 --> 01:13:26.553
She may be pretty to you
because you're...

01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:28.654
sweet on her.

01:13:28.731 --> 01:13:31.894
Stop joking. I'm not...

01:13:31.968 --> 01:13:36.234
No, no. You may think
she's pretty but...

01:13:36.305 --> 01:13:40.173
to other people she's just
a dowdy old middle-aged woman.

01:13:40.243 --> 01:13:42.575
A mouse, to be frank.

01:13:42.645 --> 01:13:44.374
Shut up!

01:13:47.216 --> 01:13:50.413
Just sit back and watch.

01:13:57.827 --> 01:13:59.556
Let's get started.

01:14:01.063 --> 01:14:02.621
Come on, Tampopo.

01:14:13.809 --> 01:14:15.674
She's finished.

01:14:17.013 --> 01:14:18.776
I'll stay here.

01:14:18.848 --> 01:14:21.783
What do you mean "stay here"?

01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:24.547
She's all done. Take a look.

01:14:26.456 --> 01:14:27.787
But I...

01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:29.450
Oh, come on.

01:15:04.328 --> 01:15:05.625
Hi.

01:15:08.265 --> 01:15:10.927
How do I look?

01:15:17.608 --> 01:15:19.473
Like a film star...

01:15:22.346 --> 01:15:24.337
...in a French movie.

01:15:37.728 --> 01:15:39.355
Do you like it?

01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:40.726
I see you don't.

01:15:41.832 --> 01:15:47.032
Not that... but you
look hard to talk to now.

01:15:47.105 --> 01:15:51.064
Let's go out somewhere, Goro.

01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:28.303
Am I trying hard enough?

01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:30.142
- Sure you are.
- Am I good?

01:16:30.214 --> 01:16:32.148
- Sure.
- You really think so?

01:16:32.216 --> 01:16:34.184
- Sure.
- I'm so glad.

01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:40.951
Why are you doing this for me?

01:16:42.527 --> 01:16:43.824
Well...

01:16:44.696 --> 01:16:46.823
Why do you try so hard?

01:16:47.465 --> 01:16:48.898
Well...

01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:51.799
It's like...

01:16:55.707 --> 01:16:58.301
everybody has their own ladder.

01:16:59.043 --> 01:17:02.411
Some climb the rungs to the top.

01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:05.644
But some don't even know
they have one.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:15.258
You helped me find my ladder, Goro.

01:17:26.205 --> 01:17:28.799
What was your husband like?

01:17:29.508 --> 01:17:31.237
A good man.

01:17:32.177 --> 01:17:35.704
Liked drinking, always in a hurry.

01:17:37.216 --> 01:17:40.982
In restaurants, he ordered sake
while walking to the table...

01:17:41.453 --> 01:17:44.445
and ordered food while sitting down.

01:17:48.026 --> 01:17:49.891
And your wife?

01:17:50.863 --> 01:17:53.263
She left with the kids.

01:17:53.332 --> 01:17:54.560
Why?

01:17:54.633 --> 01:17:56.362
Don't know.

01:18:02.141 --> 01:18:04.666
I grew up in a bad home.

01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:09.641
I wanted to make my own home
the best there was.

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:12.942
I got married.

01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:14.610
We had kids.

01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:16.953
I finally built a decent home.

01:18:19.258 --> 01:18:22.353
But I was never comfortable.

01:18:23.563 --> 01:18:27.966
I don't know how to act
in a decent home.

01:18:31.671 --> 01:18:34.105
Before I knew it my wife was gone.

01:18:39.312 --> 01:18:42.406
Sometimes I wonder if I'm really human.

01:19:05.338 --> 01:19:06.930
Hey, taxi! Hey!

01:19:18.117 --> 01:19:20.711
It was raining the day I met you.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:50.983
Damn it, we're wet.

01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:53.509
Got a cigarette?

01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:54.781
Here.

01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:08.829
I'll fill the bath.

01:25:33.364 --> 01:25:40.327
I'm so happy. It's been fun tonight.

01:25:41.072 --> 01:25:47.671
Not at all, sir. It is my honor
to be doing business with you.

01:25:47.745 --> 01:25:49.804
More sake?

01:25:50.882 --> 01:25:54.079
I'm very interested in
this investment opportunity.

01:25:54.151 --> 01:26:05.050
I don't know the details but if you
say so, it must be good, and safe too.

01:26:05.129 --> 01:26:07.621
Can I leave everything to you?

01:26:07.699 --> 01:26:08.893
Certainly, sir.

01:26:08.967 --> 01:26:12.459
I'm honored to be helping
such a famous professor.

01:26:15.073 --> 01:26:20.067
But if word gets out,
everyone will buy, so we must act now.

01:26:20.145 --> 01:26:22.079
Yes, I understand.

01:26:22.147 --> 01:26:25.014
Tomorrow is Sunday.

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:30.043
But first thing on Monday
I'll withdraw all my savings.

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:36.993
Mind you, it's not all that much.

01:26:37.062 --> 01:26:39.587
I'm just a professor.

01:26:39.665 --> 01:26:43.692
If you'll excuse me,
I must call the office.

01:26:50.943 --> 01:26:52.467
It'll be Monday.

01:26:52.544 --> 01:26:54.478
He has millions.

01:26:54.546 --> 01:26:56.673
Have the getaway car ready.

01:26:57.182 --> 01:26:59.207
He's a famous professor.

01:26:59.284 --> 01:27:02.583
He's retiring. So he's trying to...

01:27:02.654 --> 01:27:04.212
Yeah, that's right.

01:27:05.023 --> 01:27:07.014
A real sucker.

01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:48.433
Kumada, you're playing
the college professor again?

01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:52.397
Don't you ever get tired of that role?

01:27:54.407 --> 01:27:56.398
The other hand too.

01:27:59.379 --> 01:28:01.313
Please, sir.

01:28:02.815 --> 01:28:09.414
One more taste of this before I go.
I'll miss it so.

01:28:09.489 --> 01:28:11.480
Hurry up.

01:28:18.498 --> 01:28:24.061
That's odd.
I wonder where your victim went?

01:28:25.238 --> 01:28:28.264
What'll happen to me?

01:29:34.341 --> 01:29:36.206
Come on, darling!

01:29:36.276 --> 01:29:38.744
Don't die!
We need you!

01:29:38.812 --> 01:29:42.043
Come on! Don't sleep! Or you'll die!

01:29:42.449 --> 01:29:45.179
Say something! Sing!

01:29:45.619 --> 01:29:49.350
Do something! Anything.

01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:51.186
Get up and cook!

01:29:51.258 --> 01:29:52.987
Go get dinner ready!

01:31:10.205 --> 01:31:11.729
Here.

01:31:26.155 --> 01:31:28.248
Thank you, Mom.

01:31:29.858 --> 01:31:31.189
Good!

01:31:31.594 --> 01:31:33.323
It's delicious.

01:31:58.254 --> 01:32:02.088
I'm sorry. She died at 9:22.

01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:17.232
Keep on eating.

01:32:17.706 --> 01:32:19.697
It's the last meal Mom cooked!

01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:23.440
Eat, eat while it's hot.

01:33:36.886 --> 01:33:38.046
How is it?

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:44.592
Better luck next time.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.323
How can you guys be so mean?

01:33:47.764 --> 01:33:53.202
Can't you taste the difference?
I think it's much better.

01:33:53.269 --> 01:33:55.134
Can't you encourage her?

01:33:55.205 --> 01:33:56.571
I see improvements...

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.336
but we want customers
to queue up for them.

01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:07.217
They're beginning to have depth,
but they still lack substance.

01:34:07.284 --> 01:34:10.447
They're not alive enough.
They lack vigor.

01:34:10.521 --> 01:34:14.958
And they still lack profundity.

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.890
I'm sorry.

01:34:16.961 --> 01:34:19.759
Don't look so sad, Tampopo.

01:34:20.364 --> 01:34:23.094
You're making something good, right?

01:34:23.467 --> 01:34:27.927
When you do that
you should look happy.

01:34:28.939 --> 01:34:30.463
You're right.

01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:34.500
Okay. Now I'll show you
my secret recipe.

01:34:35.079 --> 01:34:37.479
Cut the onions like this.

01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:39.413
Shred the pork.

01:34:39.984 --> 01:34:44.785
Fry them lightly, put them on
the noodles. Add a dash of sesame oil.

01:34:51.028 --> 01:34:52.518
Um. It's good.

01:34:52.596 --> 01:34:54.359
- Yes, very good.
- Wonderful.

01:34:54.432 --> 01:34:55.956
Let's sell it.

01:34:56.033 --> 01:34:59.298
We should name it.
How about Spring Onion Noodles?

01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:00.894
Or Spring Onion Special?

01:35:00.971 --> 01:35:05.965
Spring Onion Special. That's good.
Customers will love it.

01:35:06.043 --> 01:35:07.772
Do you feel better now?

01:35:54.826 --> 01:35:56.259
With pork, please.

01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:59.153
That was good. Thanks.

01:36:03.001 --> 01:36:04.866
Thank you very much.

01:36:07.672 --> 01:36:09.264
With pork for me, please.

01:36:14.846 --> 01:36:16.211
Welcome.

01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:17.714
Welcome.

01:36:20.252 --> 01:36:21.116
Welcome.

01:36:21.186 --> 01:36:22.517
Welcome.

01:36:45.311 --> 01:36:47.939
You're looking serious, Mom.

01:36:48.014 --> 01:36:50.039
I'll pass their test today.

01:36:50.116 --> 01:36:52.016
After they eat these noodles and...

01:36:52.084 --> 01:36:59.320
if they drink all my soup at the end,
then I've won.

01:37:22.081 --> 01:37:23.844
Let's begin.

01:37:23.916 --> 01:37:25.349
Please!

01:39:43.491 --> 01:39:44.856
This is perfection.

01:39:44.926 --> 01:39:46.450
- Wow!
- At last!

01:39:46.527 --> 01:39:48.392
- Superb!
- Perfect!

01:39:50.898 --> 01:39:55.096
Congratulations, Tampopo.
You've won!

01:41:45.648 --> 01:41:50.551
Come on, darling! Don't die!

01:41:54.357 --> 01:41:55.949
Darling!

01:41:58.995 --> 01:42:01.225
Have I told you about it?

01:42:01.998 --> 01:42:03.295
What?

01:42:05.168 --> 01:42:07.966
About hunting wild boars in...

01:42:08.838 --> 01:42:10.271
winter.

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:14.806
There's nothing much for them
to eat, so...

01:42:16.746 --> 01:42:18.611
they dig up yams.

01:42:19.249 --> 01:42:21.717
That's all they eat.

01:42:23.486 --> 01:42:25.613
When you shoot a boar...

01:42:26.656 --> 01:42:28.453
you immediately...

01:42:28.524 --> 01:42:30.458
slit its belly...

01:42:30.526 --> 01:42:32.517
and take its guts...

01:42:32.595 --> 01:42:35.223
and grill them over an open fire.

01:42:45.775 --> 01:42:49.973
The intestines are full of yam.

01:42:52.882 --> 01:42:55.112
Yam sausages, you see?

01:42:57.387 --> 01:43:00.151
You grill them.

01:43:01.225 --> 01:43:05.161
And then slice them and eat them hot.

01:43:11.535 --> 01:43:13.127
Sound good?

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:17.438
Yes. They'd be nice with soy sauce
and horseradish.

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:23.140
What's wrong, darling?

01:43:23.213 --> 01:43:25.443
Please sit up!

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.223
I would have loved to eat them
with you.

01:43:36.226 --> 01:43:39.218
We'll do that someday.

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:44.465
We'll go hunt boars in the winter.

01:43:44.835 --> 01:43:47.565
Darling, come on!

01:43:47.638 --> 01:43:49.503
Please don't die!

01:43:50.107 --> 01:43:53.565
Shhh. Be absolutely silent.

01:44:05.923 --> 01:44:08.483
My last movie is starting.

01:45:19.164 --> 01:45:20.188
Good morning.

01:45:35.146 --> 01:45:38.344
Good morning.
And congratulations.

01:45:39.018 --> 01:45:40.610
Thanks to you.

01:45:42.121 --> 01:45:44.646
I don't believe this.

01:45:44.723 --> 01:45:46.657
And look at this beautiful counter.

01:45:46.725 --> 01:45:48.556
The lighting is perfect.

01:45:50.663 --> 01:45:52.995
Tabo, did you write the menu?

01:45:53.065 --> 01:45:54.157
Uh-huh.

01:45:54.233 --> 01:45:56.064
It's great too.

01:45:56.135 --> 01:45:57.864
Hey, Tabo.

01:45:57.937 --> 01:46:02.237
Hi, Ryuta, Yohei, Uchida.
Let's go. Bye, Mom.

01:46:02.308 --> 01:46:03.502
Bye, Tabo.

01:46:16.555 --> 01:46:18.489
Are you comfortable working here?

01:46:18.557 --> 01:46:21.151
I feel like a master chef.

01:46:24.096 --> 01:46:30.365
Frankly, I never thought a woman
could become a good noodle cook.

01:46:30.436 --> 01:46:33.098
But look at her.

01:46:33.572 --> 01:46:35.563
She's doing great.

01:46:35.641 --> 01:46:39.805
Yeah, and she looks so beautiful too.

01:46:48.787 --> 01:46:52.450
We'll drift away
when the customers start coming.

01:46:52.525 --> 01:46:53.753
Thank you so much.

01:46:53.826 --> 01:46:57.854
I feel like starting
a noodle business myself. Goodbye.

01:46:57.931 --> 01:46:59.523
Here they come.

01:46:59.599 --> 01:47:00.896
Welcome.

01:47:02.102 --> 01:47:04.570
Tampopo Noodles for me.
Lots of spring onions.

01:47:08.575 --> 01:47:10.042
Welcome.

01:47:11.244 --> 01:47:12.541
Plain noodles, please.

01:47:13.847 --> 01:47:15.212
Same for me.

01:47:15.282 --> 01:47:17.011
With lots of shinachiku.

01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:24.515
Thank you for all your help.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.529
He can't have roast pork.
So a plain one for him.

01:47:29.596 --> 01:47:31.791
I'll be at the bank.

01:47:31.865 --> 01:47:32.354
Come on, Shohei.

01:48:18.512 --> 01:48:20.070
Welcome.

01:48:21.515 --> 01:48:22.948
Welcome.

01:48:42.103 --> 01:48:43.968
A Spring Onion Special.

01:49:00.388 --> 01:49:02.253
Pork noodles for me.

01:49:56.878 --> 01:49:58.607
We did it, didn't we?

01:49:59.715 --> 01:50:01.444
Yeah, we sure did.

01:50:09.825 --> 01:50:11.690
So long... partner.
