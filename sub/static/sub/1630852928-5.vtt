01:59.744 --> 02:00.870
What is your name?

02:03.498 --> 02:04.833
Freydis Eriksdotter.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.712
Is this your first visit to Uppsala?

02:10.755 --> 02:11.589
Yes.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.928
I was sent here by Jarl Haakon
to learn more about the Gods.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.851
Come with me.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.439
Here, you are truly in
the company of the Gods…

02:29.023 --> 02:29.899
Odin…

02:32.318 --> 02:33.153
Thor,

02:34.237 --> 02:35.280
and Freya.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.288
Why else are you here?

02:53.631 --> 02:54.966
To learn my destiny.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.389


03:23.703 --> 03:25.622
Come, brother! Let's finish them!

03:25.705 --> 03:27.707
Go, Harald. Seek your revenge.
You've earned it!

03:33.755 --> 03:34.756
Come with me.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.981
Lord. Please save us!

03:58.613 --> 04:01.115
…because you will
be with me, Lord.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.834
You have found the Queen of England.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.045
I demand to see Canute.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.590
Would you settle for me?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.717
Olaf.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.329
Welcome back, Your Highness.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.019
Nobles of England!

05:12.103 --> 05:15.148
My name is Harald Sigurdsson.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.402
My brother, Sten,

05:20.194 --> 05:22.655
was your former king's bodyguard.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.534
A man whose job
was to faithfully protect him

05:26.617 --> 05:28.453
and his family from all threats.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.831
And how was that loyalty rewarded?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.167
Like this.

05:37.795 --> 05:43.217
Men of England, I didn't come here
for your money or your lands.

05:43.301 --> 05:47.472
I came for one thing and one thing only.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.308
The head of a king!

05:55.146 --> 05:57.815
Death has robbed me of your father's head.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.151
But yours will do just fine.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.236
Harald! I want him alive.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.456
No. You promised me.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.208
I have changed my mind.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.751
Lied to me, you mean.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.921
I brought an army across the sea
for this moment.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.631
You cannot deny me it now.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.217
I can and I will.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.394
If that sword strikes,

06:35.436 --> 06:37.980
your head will land next to his.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.953
Things change.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.955
And we must change with them.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.959
You must sacrifice revenge for power.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.612
Prince Harald, I'm the man
who saved you on Saint Brice's Day.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.471
-Liv, are you all right?

07:51.554 --> 07:54.682
Huh? What of the… others?

07:59.395 --> 08:03.691
I pulled them out of the river
but could take them no further.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.488
You all right?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.907
-Whoa.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.622
No, no, no, no.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.832
No, no, no. Come on, come on.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.671
She has been shot
with a double-barbed arrow.

08:25.755 --> 08:29.050
You cannot pull it out of her
without killing her immediately.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.053
If it stays,
the flesh will rot and she will die slow.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.222
And what if I push it through?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.017
She's too weak to survive it.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.190
Do it. The arrow.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.902
You're not strong enough.
It will kill you.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.781
Let me decide that.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.450
I can't lose you too, Liv.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.660
You won't.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.758
-Easy.
-Mm.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.761
Easy, easy, easy.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.810
Okay.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.983
-Easy.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.955
Easy.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.348
Unlock him.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.281
Congratulations.

10:16.741 --> 10:17.783
You mock me.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.161
Not at all. I praise you.

10:22.163 --> 10:26.584
You are an excellent fighter
and a brilliant strategist.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.215
Your night attack in the marshes…

10:35.635 --> 10:37.053
what gave you that idea?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.430
It was obvious you would attack there.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.683
I see.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.355
And the "Dragon's Teeth" in the river?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.650
To make a weapon of the tide.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.194
Brilliant.

10:54.862 --> 10:55.696
Thank you.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.909
But your best move
was sending Mercia's army to our rear.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.535
In fact,

11:03.537 --> 11:05.247
had they chosen to attack…

11:07.625 --> 11:09.210
you might have destroyed us.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.461
I would have.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.486
Do not play games with me…

11:37.988 --> 11:38.906
boy.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.243
None of those were your plans.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.205
Who was the woman on the battlements?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.623
Emma of Normundy.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.127
My father's widow.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.379
Where is she now?

11:53.462 --> 11:54.714
I have no idea.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.769
Are you comfortable?

12:16.110 --> 12:19.321
This was my room
when I was your husband's advisor.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.369
Small but cozy.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.707
What is it that you want from me, Olaf?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.417
It was your husband who instilled in me

12:31.500 --> 12:33.878
a mission to bring
Christianity to the North.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.840
It is the great challenge of my life.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.800
Do you think that is easy?

12:40.801 --> 12:44.805
To break down centuries of Gods
and stories in people's minds?

12:50.853 --> 12:54.440
It takes courage… and perseverance,

12:56.150 --> 12:57.234
-and--
-Gold.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.448
So, you do know what I want.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.451
Your husband's treasure.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.744
It is a myth.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.746
No. I saw it.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.750
Rubies and emeralds the size of walnuts.

13:13.542 --> 13:17.671
Gold bars so heavy,
one man alone cannot pick them up.

13:17.755 --> 13:22.426
The piles of silver coins so deep,
I could swim through them.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.014
If my husband kept riches,
as you describe,

13:27.097 --> 13:29.225
he did not share its hiding place with me.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.230
I think that… is a lie.

13:37.942 --> 13:41.695
You have changed much
since I saw you last, Emma.

13:41.779 --> 13:46.367
You've gone from being a Norman girl
with no rights, no land,

13:46.450 --> 13:49.662
just a piece of
her father's property, to this.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.833
The Queen of England.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.836
That takes skill.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.507
It would be a shame
to send you back to Normandy

14:01.590 --> 14:04.051
where you'd become
a piece of property again.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.679
-Is that your threat?

14:06.762 --> 14:07.638
No.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.515
This is.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.475
Hallbjorn!

14:15.396 --> 14:16.981
-Mama!
-Mother!

14:20.693 --> 14:23.362
My mission requires sacrifices.

14:28.492 --> 14:34.039
If you do that, you will take away
any reason I may have to cooperate.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.090
I will let you think on it.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.599
Don't think too long.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.977
If I find the treasure without your help,

14:55.060 --> 14:58.439
I will no longer need you… or them.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.357
Freydis!

17:08.402 --> 17:12.281
-Freydis… Freydis! Please!
-Freydis!

17:12.364 --> 17:14.950
-Don't leave!
-Freydis!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.744
-Freydis!
-Come back!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.203
Help us!

17:20.998 --> 17:22.082
Freydis!

18:13.008 --> 18:13.842
King Canute.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.241
I am the wrong man
to be alone in a room with right now.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.408
I know you are angry.

18:38.492 --> 18:42.371
Angry? I'm not angry. I am murderous!

18:42.454 --> 18:46.708
That may be, but unfortunately,
it is a risk I must take.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.169
I need your help.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.754
My help?

18:51.755 --> 18:54.758
You should have thought of that
before you lied to me about Edmund.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.469
You have been my right hand
from the beginning.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.721
I still need you.

18:59.805 --> 19:04.935
There's absolutely nothing you could say
to me right now to make me help you.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.066
What if I can make you King of Norway?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.197
I don't need your help for that.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.327
I have an agreement with my brother.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.247
When he dies, the throne will go to me.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.417
Or it will go to his son.

19:35.048 --> 19:35.924
Ah.

19:39.052 --> 19:43.223
I see you are not
as close to Olaf… as you think.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.898
The boy's name is Magnus.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.817
He's 12 and healthy,

19:53.901 --> 19:57.988
and since your brother has chosen
not to tell you about him,

19:58.071 --> 19:59.489
you are a fool to think that

19:59.573 --> 20:04.328
he will not transfer
the throne of Norway… to him.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.628
You have already
robbed my family of justice.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.715
And now you wish to pull us apart?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.515
Olaf is already doing that.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.146
Why wait for your turn…

20:33.357 --> 20:35.525
when I can guarantee your destiny?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.079
What is it you are looking for?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.097
Why did you save me?

21:06.473 --> 21:08.225
I was beginning to wonder myself.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.070
The king's men had
stopped me at the docks.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.447
And they knew who I was.

21:23.824 --> 21:27.160
Yet you interceded
and allowed me to escape London.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.707
Knowing full well
that when I found out what happened,

21:32.416 --> 21:35.085
I would return with an army
to avenge the slaughter.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.255
Why?

21:39.965 --> 21:42.175
I saved you
because I could not save England.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.637
A rotten house cannot be repaired.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.015
It must be torn down
in order to build a better one.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.350
And let me guess…

21:51.310 --> 21:54.396
In this better house of yours,
there's a place for you?

21:54.479 --> 21:58.317
I'm a survivor, Prince Harald.
I will always find a place.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.280
Canute is looking for Queen Emma.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.866
She has not been found.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.785
She is another survivor.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.246
She's probably protecting her gold.

22:11.913 --> 22:12.789
Her gold?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.209
The queen is one of the wealthiest women
in Europe. Surely you knew?

22:16.293 --> 22:17.127
No.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.965
But I know someone else who would.

22:24.801 --> 22:25.886
Wait.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.430
I saved your life.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.641
And I have spared yours.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.295
You have found me.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.216
Who are you?

23:05.634 --> 23:09.805
I am the past, the present, the future.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.516
I am the reason you are here.

23:15.769 --> 23:20.482
Let me judge for myself
what others have proclaimed as real.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.448
Yes.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.118
The last.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.286
The last?

23:33.370 --> 23:37.874
You must sit, for soon you will be tired.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.754
What did you see on your journey?

23:44.714 --> 23:46.716
I saw some beautiful things.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.554
You saw something else.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.390
There had been a great battle.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.601
Everywhere was fire and death.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.521
And they called to you for help.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.523
Yes.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.442
And how did you respond?

24:03.525 --> 24:04.693
I didn't know what I wanted--

24:04.776 --> 24:07.404
That is not what I asked. What did you do?

24:09.948 --> 24:11.491
-I ran.
-Why?

24:11.575 --> 24:13.660
-I don't know why? It's--
-You evade me.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.703
I don't know.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.664
You do know. You are lying to me,
as you lie to yourself.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.876
Do you think
we are born with all knowledge?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.712
We make the tools we need.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.847
There is no going back
from here, only forward.

24:34.723 --> 24:40.645
And the cries you ran from
will grow stronger, until…

24:48.612 --> 24:50.947
Don't look for me again.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.206
Wait… Where are you?

25:27.400 --> 25:28.360
King Canute.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.533
I'm Eadric Streona, Ealdorman of Mercia.

25:35.283 --> 25:36.993
Welcome, Eadric Streona.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.412
I recognize your banners.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.123
You had my army at your mercy

25:43.041 --> 25:44.334
and stayed your hand.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.088
I am grateful for your decision,

25:49.714 --> 25:51.216
but curious of your reason.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.803
Sometimes rewards
can be gained without a fight.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.059
Indeed.

26:03.311 --> 26:07.065
Please, be my guest at our feast tonight.

26:07.148 --> 26:11.444
And perhaps we may discuss
a suitable reward for your actions.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.794
Queen Emma, I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

26:28.503 --> 26:29.838
How did you find me?

26:30.505 --> 26:33.592
I'd like to say it was difficult,
but I am Olaf's younger brother.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.303
I used to sleep here when I came to visit.

26:36.386 --> 26:39.014
I found it depressing then,
and even more so now.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.433
We should go.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.062
Goodbye, my friends.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.816
You've come so far for me.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.946
May you sleep in the embrace of Ran

28:18.905 --> 28:21.491
and be reunited
with your departed loved ones.

28:27.914 --> 28:28.915
I'll miss you.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.264
Leif Eriksson? You're to come with us.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.058
Go away. I'm busy.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.145
It is not a request.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.269
-Friends!

29:32.937 --> 29:34.856
We have won a great victory.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.737
Saint Brice's Day
and the spilled blood of our kinfolk

29:41.821 --> 29:43.698
has been avenged!

29:51.456 --> 29:52.457
And for you

29:53.124 --> 29:57.337
who have so faithfully supported me
in this sacred mission,

29:59.047 --> 30:00.423
your payment has come.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.263
Yeah!

30:26.241 --> 30:29.619
But let us not be
ungenerous in victory.

30:29.702 --> 30:33.456
Young King Edmund was entitled
to defend his father's honor

30:34.165 --> 30:36.000
and he did so with courage.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.795
Let us toast his bravery.

30:45.093 --> 30:49.222
More importantly, let us recognize one
whose battle plan

30:50.223 --> 30:52.517
almost defeated us all.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.571
Queen Emma of Normundy.

31:08.908 --> 31:11.327
You honor us with your presence.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.586
Please, sit next to me here.

31:29.804 --> 31:30.638
Thank you.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.522
Before I honor
my warlords with these spoils,

31:41.983 --> 31:45.320
there are some debts that must be settled.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.865
I ask you, what would you call a man

31:48.948 --> 31:52.327
who would put brotherhood
before obedience to a king?

31:57.582 --> 32:00.877
We would call him… a Greenlander.

32:02.253 --> 32:06.299
This is the man who dreamed
of pulling down London Bridge.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.550
And did it!

32:14.015 --> 32:16.517
-Greenlander!
-Greenlander!

32:18.478 --> 32:19.938
Leif Eriksson…

32:24.734 --> 32:28.404
Your sister's debt is paid in full.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.990
What more would you ask of me?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.743
What lands? What spoils of war?

32:36.746 --> 32:37.997
I got what I came for.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.251
Yes, you did.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.462
And more.

32:46.798 --> 32:51.511
May his name never be forgotten
amongst our people…

32:55.473 --> 32:59.894
or thought of again as someone's son.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.911
How does glory feel, brother?

33:17.787 --> 33:18.663
Like gold.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.791
No. Better.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.460
And Harald Sigurdsson,

33:25.044 --> 33:30.258
Leif's brave brother-in-arms
who promised me victory, and delivered.

33:32.635 --> 33:35.888
My gratitude is worth more than gold.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.266
More than gold!

33:39.142 --> 33:40.768
Did you all hear that?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.898
And I'll hold you to it.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.904
And another debt,

33:52.613 --> 33:57.827
our honored guest from the North,
the Ealdorman of Mercia, Eadric Streona,

33:58.453 --> 34:02.707
who will always have my gratitude
for holding back his army.

34:02.790 --> 34:07.837
Although, I think he would prefer
something more than gratitude.

34:09.088 --> 34:10.423
You see? I am right.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.634
Speak, Eadric Streona.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.472
Thank you, King Canute.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.476
What I ask for is also my gift to you.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.729
When you and your great warriors
return to Scandinavia,

34:24.812 --> 34:28.149
you will need an ally in these lands
you can depend on for support.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.277
A ruler you can count on.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.365
Are you suggesting yourself
for this role, Eadric Streona?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.366
I am.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.913
You'd do worse than have
a strong friend at your back,

34:41.996 --> 34:44.082
as opposed to an impetuous boy.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.293
Hmm.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.674
This… This is a gift.

34:54.258 --> 34:58.262
It is good to listen to a man
who knows his own mind

34:59.222 --> 35:01.057
and has the courage to speak it.

35:03.601 --> 35:08.314
-And, Olaf, bravest of the brave.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.568
Whose mighty ships rowed against the tides

35:12.652 --> 35:15.154
and pulled down the great bridge.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.325
Smile for once.

35:21.911 --> 35:25.915
We have had our differences,
but tonight we are brothers in victory,

35:25.998 --> 35:29.669
and… no gift is too great

35:29.752 --> 35:32.672
for such a brother and friend.

35:37.844 --> 35:43.808
See, this feast is not about old quarrels,
but new beginnings.

35:44.767 --> 35:49.730
But new beginnings cannot happen
with a traitor in our midst.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.710
A person that brings with them

36:12.003 --> 36:16.674
the stench of betrayal and threat.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.595
Here, in the very room

36:21.971 --> 36:25.808
where Æthelred turned
against his Viking ally,

36:25.892 --> 36:31.564
there is once more
an oath breaker among us.

36:33.941 --> 36:38.321
I can smell their ambition.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.156
I can smell…

36:42.325 --> 36:44.118
disloyalty.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.707
I can smell

36:50.625 --> 36:54.587
their… greed.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.258
Stop! Stop!
My men will kill you for this!

36:59.342 --> 37:02.595
Your men are dead,
and your army is surrounded.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.223
Why? Why are you doing this?

37:05.806 --> 37:11.062
Because… it is I, Eadric Streona,

37:11.687 --> 37:13.231
not you,

37:13.314 --> 37:17.276
who will be the next King of England!

37:36.921 --> 37:43.052
Did you say you intend
to claim the throne of England?

37:43.135 --> 37:44.053
I did.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.348
And I will rule jointly with King Edmund.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.559
Is that a problem?

37:51.686 --> 37:52.520
Yes.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.701
You've just made raiding England
that much harder.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.084
To Canute!

38:15.167 --> 38:17.878
The first Viking King of England!

38:18.587 --> 38:21.966
An accomplishment not even Ragnar Lothbrok

38:22.049 --> 38:24.260
or Ivar "the Boneless" could claim!

38:24.343 --> 38:27.096
To Canute! King of England!

38:31.142 --> 38:32.393
Now we feast!

38:46.866 --> 38:49.410
How exactly do you see
this arrangement working?

38:49.493 --> 38:51.329
You have the support
of the nobles.

38:51.912 --> 38:56.208
Which is important to me
and will be your job to manage.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.754
As long as you do it well,
we'll get along fine.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.217
Relax, Edmund.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.387
If I had any doubts about you,

39:09.221 --> 39:12.433
I would have brought in
two stumps.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.560
I'm furious at you.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.230
And why is that, brother?

39:18.314 --> 39:19.732
You know why.

39:23.361 --> 39:29.075
And yet, it doesn't bother you to tell me
I am uncle to a future king of Norway.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.998
My son changes nothing between us.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.000
Says the man who lied to me.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.673
You are a brilliant woman.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.093
And you are a ruthless man.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.886
You mean Streona?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.932
No. I am a practical man.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.977
I could not rest with such
a treacherous man at my back.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.896
And neither would you.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.815
I wasn't worried about him.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.734
Are you worried about me?

40:08.781 --> 40:09.824
Yeah.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.201
I'm worried about my children.

40:13.327 --> 40:17.164
They have been taken from me
and I fear for their lives.

40:22.878 --> 40:25.464
-More wine for the queen.
-Yes, Canute.

40:26.799 --> 40:27.633
Tell me.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.010
I cannot.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.264
Their captor is at this table.

40:34.056 --> 40:37.268
And he would kill them instantly
if he knew I was asking for your help.

40:38.894 --> 40:40.062
I will find them for you.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.826
Get up. I have an urgent request.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.578
Then go and ask someone who cares.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.497
I need to find Emma's children.

40:59.081 --> 41:03.127
Well, as you can see, they're not with me.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.503
I know Olaf has them.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.964
They must be found quickly

41:07.047 --> 41:09.341
and you are one of the few men
capable of doing that.

41:15.973 --> 41:20.019
What if I can promise you a place
in this new house you're building?

41:20.811 --> 41:23.314
You've already shown me
how little your promise means.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.774
Find someone else to help you.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.923
What about a promise from me?

41:51.175 --> 41:54.094
They see you raise your axe and they run.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.514
-They drop their weapons and run!

41:56.597 --> 42:01.393
How do you protect the king
when you wail and weep away from your…

42:03.062 --> 42:03.896
How?

42:32.883 --> 42:35.177
Olaf has sent me to give
communion to the children.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.388
Sorry, Father.

42:38.138 --> 42:39.723
No need to apologize.

42:41.725 --> 42:45.604
Boys, close your eyes and pray out loud.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.153
Have you had communion today?

42:53.237 --> 42:54.363
No.

42:54.446 --> 42:56.240
Kneel, and receive God's blessing.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.160
Louder, so that God can hear you.

43:13.299 --> 43:16.176
That will do. You prayed well.
Time to go. Quickly.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.388
What happened to them?

43:20.055 --> 43:22.141
They've gone to heaven. Come on.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.078
Where is she?

43:43.162 --> 43:45.748
Outside. We had to make room for another.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.728
You look surprised.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.606
I am. You're not dead.

44:11.523 --> 44:14.109
I told you, I'm tougher than you think.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.781
You. You're the one who
brought down London Bridge.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.533
He's famous now.

44:21.617 --> 44:25.913
They will write songs about you,
and Canute will shower you with gold.

44:34.004 --> 44:36.340
Did Canute shower you with gold?

44:36.423 --> 44:39.593
Better. He gave us Freydis' freedom.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.182
Then we can go home.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.022
Liv, I'm…

44:55.025 --> 44:56.735
I'm not going back to Greenland.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.406
There's nothing for me there.

45:01.657 --> 45:05.744
And I've made a name for myself
among these people.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.038
A strong name.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.295
And I want you with me.

45:24.888 --> 45:26.265
Then I will be with you.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.373
You all right?

45:55.919 --> 45:57.296
I'm so glad you're alive.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.467
The Gods didn't want me yet.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.595
You should let her rest.

46:08.682 --> 46:10.225
I'll be back in the morning.

46:29.870 --> 46:31.121
Are you looking for this?

47:25.384 --> 47:26.218
Enter.

47:29.721 --> 47:30.597
King Canute.

47:30.681 --> 47:31.932
I beg your pardon.

47:32.015 --> 47:34.560
I'm sorry to disturb you
at such a late hour,

47:35.310 --> 47:38.397
I did not think you would want
to wait until morning for news.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.444
-Mama.
-Mother!

47:49.950 --> 47:50.868
Hmm.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.037
King Canute.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.001
Thank you.

48:00.085 --> 48:01.545
You are welcome, Queen Emma.

48:04.798 --> 48:05.632
Good night.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.526
You were the one
who tried to save the Boy King.

48:25.110 --> 48:26.403
-I am.
-Hmm.

48:26.486 --> 48:28.614
And do you have a request for me,

48:29.197 --> 48:30.240
other than your freedom?

48:30.824 --> 48:32.826
No, Your Highness. I wish for nothing.

48:33.327 --> 48:37.247
But I believe I could be of service to you
here in England. Should you require it.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.086
-What is your name?
-Godwin.

48:44.338 --> 48:45.255
Hmm.

48:47.132 --> 48:48.175
Godwin.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.724
Oh, great hero!

48:57.142 --> 49:01.480
Come drink… with the man
who made a deal with the devil

49:02.022 --> 49:04.816
and sold his honor
for 30 pieces of silver.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.659
I don't know what that means.

49:14.910 --> 49:19.289
It means I traded my brother Sten's honor
for the crown of Norway.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.044
Well, you must've had a good reason.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.879
Yeah, I did.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.131
I do not trust Olaf.

49:29.299 --> 49:30.258
Hmm.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.094
Then only time will tell

49:33.095 --> 49:36.098
if it was you or the devil
who got the better bargain.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.978
Thank you, my friend.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.312
Enough of me.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.147
What troubles you?

49:44.940 --> 49:46.608
-You're a hero.
-Yeah.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.527
And alive, when so many are dead.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.570
"Leif the Lucky!"

49:50.654 --> 49:51.488
Hmm.

49:56.284 --> 49:57.285
It wasn't luck.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.499
You saw it happen.

50:02.582 --> 50:07.212
The arrows, they fell like rain,
but they didn't fall on me.

50:11.049 --> 50:14.803
It was as if something or someone…

50:18.473 --> 50:19.808
was protecting me.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.686
How did you get this?

50:23.687 --> 50:24.938
In the marshes,

50:25.022 --> 50:28.191
just before you saved me,
a little girl placed it in my hands.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.612
I left it with Liv when she was dying and…

50:34.906 --> 50:36.158
now she's better.

50:37.159 --> 50:40.537
Tell me, Prince. Is that luck?

50:42.039 --> 50:45.542
No. It's called a "miracle."

50:51.339 --> 50:52.924
It's a Christian word.

50:53.925 --> 50:57.220
When something happens
that can only be explained by God.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.393
What if I don't believe in your God?

51:05.854 --> 51:07.397
Maybe He believes in you.

51:09.941 --> 51:11.902
But fair warning, brother,

51:12.778 --> 51:17.949
miracles, like deals with the devil…

51:18.033 --> 51:19.743
…come with strings attached.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.289
Something is always expected in return.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.446
Here. Drink.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.036
Thank you.

52:06.998 --> 52:08.375
I should go soon.

52:08.458 --> 52:11.753
You are closer
to death than you are to life.

52:12.462 --> 52:14.589
You would not make it 20 steps.

52:15.298 --> 52:16.716
I should find Freydis.

52:19.052 --> 52:20.846
Your friend is fine.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.306
She's in Uppsala.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.687
-What is it?
-Be silent.

52:37.737 --> 52:38.655
Shh.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.366
I have a way with babies.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.743
Shh.

52:46.204 --> 52:47.080
Please--

52:47.164 --> 52:48.623
I'm not here for your child.

52:49.374 --> 52:53.003
I followed a trail of blood
to your cottage.

52:55.755 --> 52:58.341
Many people come to me when they are hurt.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.720
Well, I'm not interested
in many people.

53:01.803 --> 53:02.804
Only one.

53:03.638 --> 53:07.350
A warrior who killed one of my berserkers.

53:17.402 --> 53:19.571
You are a Pagan?

53:24.367 --> 53:25.202
Yes.

53:35.086 --> 53:38.965
In my faith, we baptize babies
in case they die young,

53:40.383 --> 53:43.094
so they will not be damned
in the fires of hell.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.807
The one you want is not here.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.268
She left three days ago.

53:50.852 --> 53:51.937
-She?
-Yes.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.396
A woman.

53:54.105 --> 53:56.524
She had been attacked
on the way to Uppsala.

53:58.318 --> 53:59.236
Describe her.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.780
Tall. Young…

54:02.906 --> 54:06.326
And she has a scar on her back
in the shape of a cross.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.203
A cross?

54:09.746 --> 54:12.040
Like this? Hmm?

54:14.542 --> 54:15.377
Yes.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.925
-Please, may I have my child?
-Shh.

54:25.720 --> 54:28.807
There were two trails of blood.

54:31.434 --> 54:35.188
Now, tell me, was she alone?

55:25.613 --> 55:27.782
I must go. I need a horse.

55:32.037 --> 55:33.997
Here. Take this.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.426
Come on! Hyah!
