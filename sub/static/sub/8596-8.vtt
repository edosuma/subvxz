WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:01.962
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.170 --> 00:04.839
Version two of my code
isn't on any

00:05.048 --> 00:06.883
of the 12 stations
that made up the ark.

00:07.092 --> 00:08.218
There was supposed
to be 13.

00:08.426 --> 00:09.719
Is this
where we're going?

00:09.928 --> 00:10.887
The people there
are not a threat.

00:11.096 --> 00:12.639
We need that land.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.849
With the loss of mount
weather's resources,

00:15.058 --> 00:17.102
Arkadia will be starving
in less than a year.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.520
I'm here to warn you.

00:18.728 --> 00:19.771
They want your land,

00:19.980 --> 00:22.524
and they will kill
all of you to get it.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.776
We need to talk
about your sister.

00:24.985 --> 00:27.278
Someone in this camp
is giving her information.

00:27.487 --> 00:28.488
We both know who.

00:28.697 --> 00:30.031
Skaikru attacked
their village.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.158
We will blockade
the 13th clan.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.494
We will give them time
to take out their leaders

00:34.703 --> 00:36.121
from within.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.956
Any Skaikru caught
across the line

00:38.164 --> 00:40.959
will be subject
to a kill order.

00:52.262 --> 00:53.596
Man, on radio:
That's a negative.

00:53.805 --> 00:56.224
Still no response
from recon team B. No word.

00:56.433 --> 00:58.059
Let me know
if the status changes.

00:58.268 --> 00:59.686
Man, on radio:
Copy that.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.396
And?

01:01.604 --> 01:04.357
Sir, we lost contact with
one of our recon teams.

01:04.566 --> 01:05.984
There were 4 men.

01:06.192 --> 01:08.695
3 teams departed
Arkadia at 0800 hours

01:08.903 --> 01:10.363
on routine patrol.

01:10.572 --> 01:13.158
Each of them reported
grounder contact

01:13.366 --> 01:15.076
less than a mile
outside of camp.

01:15.285 --> 01:17.787
As per your orders,
two teams retreated

01:17.996 --> 01:19.956
and made it safely
back inside the walls.

01:20.165 --> 01:21.207
Third?

01:21.416 --> 01:23.376
Was forced to engage.

01:23.585 --> 01:25.045
I believe they were
attempting to secure

01:25.253 --> 01:27.964
a defensive position
when...

01:28.173 --> 01:31.009
They ceased
transmissions.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.805
Grounders
are close.

01:36.014 --> 01:38.767
Gathering from
the north and west.

01:38.975 --> 01:41.728
It appears they're
establishing a blockade.

01:41.936 --> 01:45.023
There's no way
through it.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.150
Something's changed.

01:48.902 --> 01:51.988
Sir, you need
to see this.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.915
What do they want?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.500
They brought
a message.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.587
I've seen this
before.

02:14.594 --> 02:15.970
Open the gate.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.014
Do what he says.

02:18.223 --> 02:19.891
Open the gate.

02:35.365 --> 02:36.199
Talk.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.326
We seek the one
you call pike.

02:39.244 --> 02:39.953
Why?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.455
An army has fallen,
blood soaking the earth

02:42.664 --> 02:44.874
where he took
their lives one by one.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.044
Welcome to the war
against Skaikru.

02:48.253 --> 02:51.756
Life was taken.
We demand life in return.

02:53.383 --> 02:55.426
My life?

02:56.553 --> 03:00.431
What are
your terms, sir?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.101
Come with us,
and we walk away.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.186
Walk away
from what?

03:05.395 --> 03:07.272
By order of the commander,
you have been surrounded

03:07.480 --> 03:09.232
by an army
of the 12 clans.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.234
In every direction,
warriors wait to kill

03:11.442 --> 03:13.820
anyone who attempts
to cross the blockade,

03:14.028 --> 03:15.989
to greet them
as we greeted those

03:16.197 --> 03:20.535
we caught outside
your walls today.

03:22.787 --> 03:24.539
We left the bodies
for the animals.

03:24.747 --> 03:26.791
That's enough.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.043
Let's go.
They won't leave.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.837
I have
seen this before.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.797
The men who wore
those uniforms

03:33.006 --> 03:35.341
took a long time
to die.

03:35.550 --> 03:38.720
Bellamy, fall back.
That's an order.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.680
If you do not
give up your leader,

03:40.889 --> 03:43.850
you will all take
a long time to die.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.226
Bellamy--

03:45.435 --> 03:48.271
choose the side that's
best for your people.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.276
I do that every day.

03:53.484 --> 03:54.903
Uh!

03:58.948 --> 04:00.867
So far, nothing
has changed my mind.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.203
Shut the gate. Go.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.747
Our lookouts confirm
another 3 encampments

04:47.956 --> 04:49.958
just over
that Ridge.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.542
Well, they're not
hiding from us.

04:51.751 --> 04:53.211
That's for sure.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.713
How many days can we
keep our population fed

04:55.922 --> 04:57.966
without being able
to send out hunting parties?

04:58.174 --> 04:59.634
Food and water
stores were already

04:59.842 --> 05:01.761
at less than 60%,

05:01.970 --> 05:05.223
now maybe a week
before we go critical,

05:05.431 --> 05:07.558
two if we start
rationing immediately.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.645
Immediately it is.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.273
What about breaking
the blockade?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
After Bellamy's
theatrics this morning,

05:15.692 --> 05:17.110
they'll expect that.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.028
Regardless, we can't
engage the grounders

05:19.237 --> 05:21.239
until we've got our own
people under control,

05:21.447 --> 05:22.907
and that starts
with Kane.

05:23.116 --> 05:25.493
I need you to suspend
access to the prisoners,

05:25.702 --> 05:27.412
no contact with
anyone in camp.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.747
For all we know, they've
been providing intel

05:29.956 --> 05:31.332
on grounder villages
to Kane...

05:31.541 --> 05:33.042
Yes, sir.

05:33.251 --> 05:34.919
And I want you
to take over

05:35.128 --> 05:37.130
coordination
of camp surveillance.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.550
We'll need new security
protocols at all camp entrances.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.720
Maybe, uh, changing
critical passwords

05:43.928 --> 05:45.805
- every 12 hours.
- Good.

05:46.014 --> 05:47.140
Coordinate
with your mom

05:47.348 --> 05:48.975
but keep
the circle tight.

05:49.183 --> 05:53.855
Then there's the matter
of campwide surveillance.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.858
You want us to spy
on our people?

06:00.320 --> 06:03.197
We can't do what's needed
to defend this camp

06:03.406 --> 06:05.658
if every order I give
is leaked

06:05.867 --> 06:07.660
before it can
be executed.

06:07.869 --> 06:11.080
It's an old saying,
but it's true--

06:11.289 --> 06:14.375
the walls have ears,

06:15.585 --> 06:17.628
and we can't afford
any more assumptions

06:17.837 --> 06:20.548
about who's
a friend and who isn't,

06:20.757 --> 06:22.467
not your oldest
acquaintance,

06:22.675 --> 06:25.720
not your husband, wife,
or lover.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.182
We're fighting two wars now,
and the more dangerous one

06:29.390 --> 06:31.726
is here inside this camp.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.896
We can't prove it yet,
but Kane and his accomplices

06:35.104 --> 06:37.523
passed information
to Octavia.

06:37.732 --> 06:39.233
I know none of you
signed up

06:39.442 --> 06:41.527
to investigate
your neighbors,

06:41.736 --> 06:44.238
but Monroe and Lacroix
died because the traitors

06:44.447 --> 06:48.034
in this camp sold them out
to the grounders.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.495
Whoever did that
will be hunted down

06:50.703 --> 06:53.081
and exposed for what they did
to their own,

06:53.289 --> 06:55.333
for what they did to us.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.086
Now you get
whatever resources,

06:58.294 --> 07:00.505
whatever personnel
you need

07:00.755 --> 07:02.965
to make that happen.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.300
Dismissed.

07:06.511 --> 07:08.805
If they're gonna play that game,
we need to play it, too.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.515
Meaning?

07:10.723 --> 07:13.267
We don't meet here again,
for starters.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.771
We change our patterns,
forget our habits.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.148
Take a different route through
camp each time we go out.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.234
Assume that there are eyes
on us at all times.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.527
Or we could
just shock-lash

07:22.735 --> 07:23.736
pike's fascist ass

07:23.945 --> 07:25.154
and hand him
to the grounders.

07:25.363 --> 07:28.282
That would be murder,
not to mention treason,

07:28.491 --> 07:30.451
and that's not
who we are.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.664
Maybe it's who
we need to be.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.215
Not yet.

07:44.424 --> 07:46.968
All right. Then
what's the plan?

07:49.971 --> 07:51.222
What do you mean,
there's no more alcohol?

07:51.431 --> 07:52.432
What kind of
a bartender are you?

07:52.640 --> 07:53.683
First off,
I'm not a bartender.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.934
You could
say that again.

07:55.143 --> 07:57.019
Second, according
to pike's order,

07:57.228 --> 07:58.896
all resources are
to be rationed

07:59.105 --> 08:00.648
until the grounder
blockade is lifted.

08:00.857 --> 08:01.607
That means food...

08:01.816 --> 08:02.733
I'm not hungry.

08:02.942 --> 08:03.943
And water.

08:04.152 --> 08:05.361
We live
next to a lake.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.238
Which the grounders
have poisoned.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.198
We're filtering
at the pump,

08:09.407 --> 08:10.658
but that can't
keep up with demand,

08:10.867 --> 08:14.287
so that means
no alcohol.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.956
How sure are you
that the debris

08:17.165 --> 08:18.958
from the 13th station
fell into the ocean?

08:19.167 --> 08:20.334
Alie and I ran
the trajectories

08:20.543 --> 08:21.919
a thousand
times,

08:22.128 --> 08:23.880
literally
a thousand times.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.590
But what is
the actual probability

08:25.798 --> 08:26.799
that you're right?

08:27.008 --> 08:29.594
Between 75% and 80%.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.637
Not good enough.
Keep looking.

08:31.846 --> 08:34.348
I told you, this is
as good as it gets.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.058
Then you need
more resources.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.102
How?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.940
We need to increase
the population

08:43.149 --> 08:44.150
in the city of light.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.693
The more minds
turned to the task,

08:45.902 --> 08:47.904
the more powerful
Alie becomes

08:48.112 --> 08:51.657
and the closer we get to
finding that second a.I.

08:51.866 --> 08:54.160
One problem--when
Abby shut us down,

08:54.368 --> 08:56.329
pike confiscated
our chip-maker.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.872
Then we need
to get it back.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.707
How? Who's gonna be
crazy enough to--

08:59.916 --> 09:01.250
I don't even need
a whole bottle.

09:01.459 --> 09:03.002
- Just give me a glass.
- You got a problem, Jasper.

09:03.211 --> 09:05.671
Float you, Sinclair.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.603
I need every crate
checked, not just counted.

09:20.811 --> 09:24.023
We need all the ammo
we can scrounge.

09:24.232 --> 09:27.944
Well, most of these crates
are less than third capacity.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.364
I don't know
what kind of outfit

09:31.572 --> 09:34.033
chancellor Griffin
was running around here.

09:34.242 --> 09:36.536
Kind that
wasn't planning

09:36.744 --> 09:38.955
on a war footing
for life.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.624
A word?

09:45.670 --> 09:47.255
You don't really
believe you can make

09:47.463 --> 09:50.424
enough bullets to stop
all the grounders, do you?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.885
I have to.

09:54.887 --> 09:58.057
No. You need
to turn yourself in

09:58.266 --> 09:59.475
and end
this blockade.

09:59.684 --> 10:01.561
Is that why you're here,
to run this plan by me?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.813
I'm here because I have
a responsibility

10:04.021 --> 10:05.439
to speak to you like
someone who understands

10:05.648 --> 10:08.234
this world in a way
that you don't.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.736
The only way this
doesn't end with us dead

10:10.945 --> 10:13.239
is you doing
the right thing.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.824
Like you all did
the right thing

10:15.032 --> 10:17.577
when you turned in
that boy Finn?

10:17.785 --> 10:20.162
You surrendered
one of the young lives

10:20.371 --> 10:22.415
you swore to protect,
and the grounders

10:22.623 --> 10:24.333
did what
they always do.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.043
They betrayed you.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.838
There's only one way
for this war to end--

10:29.046 --> 10:31.507
we put the grounders down
and keep them down

10:31.716 --> 10:33.342
until they know better
than to take

10:33.551 --> 10:35.595
one more step
in our direction.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.764
You've become
a dictator, Charles.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.516
You realize that,
don't you?

10:40.725 --> 10:42.184
I am the chancellor.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.438
I'm doing what's necessary,
nothing more, nothing less.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.692
When this ends with
our camp in ruins...

10:51.110 --> 10:53.321
You won't be able to say
no one told you

10:53.529 --> 10:54.697
there was
a better way out.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.074
No. When this ends
with Arkadia victorious,

10:57.283 --> 10:59.535
you'll only have
yourself to blame

10:59.744 --> 11:02.705
for choosing
the wrong side.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.634
You said
there'd be booze.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.636
- I lied...
- Oh, damn it.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.387
But I brought you here
to talk about something

11:18.596 --> 11:20.598
you might find
even more interesting--

11:20.806 --> 11:22.558
the city of light.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.435
Go on.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.523
I hear you have
experience

11:29.732 --> 11:31.942
breaking into offices
of elected officials.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.236
That I do.

11:35.905 --> 11:38.949
Pike's office.
Chip-maker?

11:39.158 --> 11:40.910
You'll need
to distract the guards.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.161
They know
I'm with Jaha,

11:42.370 --> 11:43.412
but they think
that you're just a--

11:43.621 --> 11:45.414
drunken idiot.
I know.

11:45.623 --> 11:47.875
For what it's worth,
I think you're more than that.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.710
Thanks.

11:49.919 --> 11:52.046
If we're lucky enough
to get to the door,

11:52.254 --> 11:54.048
pike's changed
his access code,

11:54.256 --> 11:55.383
5-digit numeric.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.051
Ha ha! That's
gonna have, like,

11:57.259 --> 11:58.844
a trillion different
combinations.

11:59.053 --> 12:00.346
A hundred million,
but yeah.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.264
Who is gonna
figure that out?

12:02.473 --> 12:04.058
I was thinking you.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.894
Ah. Well, we
were just talking

12:07.103 --> 12:08.688
about how I'm
a drunken idiot.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.023
Pike put Monty in charge
of internal surveillance.

12:11.232 --> 12:12.525
My guess is,
he's got him in

12:12.733 --> 12:14.068
on electronic
security, as well,

12:14.276 --> 12:16.529
which means we don't have
to crack pike's password,

12:16.737 --> 12:18.948
just Monty's,

12:19.156 --> 12:22.159
and who knows more
about Monty than you?

12:22.368 --> 12:25.454
Sounds like
a terrible idea.

12:26.497 --> 12:28.332
I'm in.

12:28.541 --> 12:31.127
Ha ha! All right.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.589
Hey, anyone followed?

12:35.798 --> 12:36.966
No.
What about you?

12:37.174 --> 12:39.677
No. No. I'm good.
Any word from Octavia?

12:39.885 --> 12:41.178
Been scanning different
channels all morning.

12:41.387 --> 12:42.930
Nothing. I mean, either
she's out of range--

12:43.139 --> 12:44.223
or they already
got her.

12:44.432 --> 12:45.725
Or she ran
her battery down

12:45.933 --> 12:47.351
or she needed the radio silence
to run the blockade.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.561
There are
a lot of reasons

12:48.769 --> 12:49.603
why she might have
gone dark.

12:49.812 --> 12:50.771
I've been out there
patrolling

12:50.980 --> 12:52.064
for the last
3 months.

12:52.273 --> 12:53.733
I know this area better
than any grounder.

12:53.941 --> 12:54.734
Just let me go out--

12:54.942 --> 12:56.902
guys,
listen to this.

12:57.111 --> 13:00.698
Results of this morning's
missions inventory was sobering.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.284
In no way do we
currently have the ammo

13:03.492 --> 13:06.120
for an extended series
of firefights, not even close.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.330
So what's plan "B"?

13:08.539 --> 13:11.041
Our lookouts say
the largest grounder encampment

13:11.250 --> 13:13.419
is in this valley,
so we deploy an assault team

13:13.627 --> 13:16.005
in rover one, and we
do as much damage

13:16.213 --> 13:18.048
as we can
with automatic weapons.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.842
And they'll
just fall back

13:20.050 --> 13:21.177
and make a run
for reinforcements.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.053
I'm counting
on that.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.765
The only way there and back
is over this Ridge.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.559
Now, we can bottleneck their
warriors and pick them off.

13:28.768 --> 13:29.727
We got
the firepower for that?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.187
We won't need it.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.813
We have a dozen
concussive

13:33.022 --> 13:35.191
antipersonnel devices
in our armory.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.276
I've already got
a weapons man rigging them

13:37.485 --> 13:38.986
with a remote trigger.

13:39.195 --> 13:40.988
We load the APDs
into the rover

13:41.197 --> 13:43.365
and mine the field
before we attack.

13:43.574 --> 13:46.952
After we strike, we lure
their reinforcements

13:47.161 --> 13:48.954
onto the Ridge,
and once we have

13:49.163 --> 13:51.373
enough grounders
in the killing box--

13:51.582 --> 13:54.335
we detonate.
It'll buy us some time, but--

13:54.543 --> 13:57.880
time's
what we need.

14:03.052 --> 14:04.261
We move at dawn.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.932
All right.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.850
We need to disable
that rover.

14:10.059 --> 14:11.352
If they take it out,
it doesn't matter

14:11.560 --> 14:13.395
how many grounders
they kill.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.397
10 times that number
will descend on Arkadia,

14:15.606 --> 14:17.066
and no one'll survive.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.277
You got any idea how
we're gonna stop them?

14:20.486 --> 14:22.738
I might.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.593
Last chance
to pull out.

14:44.802 --> 14:46.345
This plan has
a high probability

14:46.554 --> 14:49.098
of going South.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.809
Right. Yeah.
I wouldn't miss it.

14:53.686 --> 14:56.146
Be ready in an hour.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.568
Bellamy,
you were right.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.944
I've got eyes on Kane.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.112
Bellamy, on radio:
Anything suspicious?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.030
Yeah. He's got
something going,

15:05.239 --> 15:06.699
and I think Sinclair's
part of it.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.119
Copy that.
We'll stay on Sinclair.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.612
Bellamy's heading
towards you now.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.949
Sinclair,
what are you up to?

15:49.158 --> 15:51.201
Raven said the solenoid
is acting up,

15:51.410 --> 15:52.786
so I thought
I'd swap it out.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.250
You got a work order
for that?

15:58.459 --> 16:01.754
Sure. I think
it's on my desk.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.508
Go.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.677
Go! Right there.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.387
Right there.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.265
Turn around.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.728
There is no work order,

16:17.937 --> 16:20.147
and there is nothing
wrong with the rover,

16:20.356 --> 16:21.523
though if you had
another 10 minutes,

16:21.732 --> 16:23.192
I'm sure there would be.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.862
You're under arrest.
The charge is treason.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.700
All right.
Come on.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.082
That's one down.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.094
Anything?

16:50.302 --> 16:52.304
Not a word.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.941
Perhaps you'd like
to talk about that.

17:06.986 --> 17:08.153
Never seen it before.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.572
Really? I thought
you engineers

17:10.781 --> 17:13.283
like to take credit
for your work.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.456
Give me your gun.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.978
You planning on
using that on me, too?

17:41.186 --> 17:43.939
Will it help you
give up any names?

17:46.150 --> 17:47.818
He'll talk eventually.

17:48.027 --> 17:49.903
- Let's put him in lock-up.
- He's a traitor.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.239
- On the ark--
- we would have floated him...

17:56.869 --> 17:59.538
But we're not on the ark.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.173
Lock him up.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.887
Move.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.183
What else could Monty
have used as a password?

18:19.391 --> 18:20.976
You mean other than
the 500 ideas

18:21.185 --> 18:22.186
I've already
come up with?

18:22.394 --> 18:23.854
Just think.
Don't overanalyze.

18:24.063 --> 18:25.606
Right, speaking of which,
how, exactly are you

18:25.814 --> 18:27.024
connected to
the computer here?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.817
I mean, how do you
know every idea I've had

18:29.026 --> 18:30.152
is wrong without
even trying it?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.862
We don't have
time for questions.

18:32.071 --> 18:33.447
There will be a guard
checking this room

18:33.655 --> 18:35.783
in approximately
5 minutes.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.284
Raven?

18:37.493 --> 18:38.952
It'll be easier for you
to see for yourself

18:39.161 --> 18:40.329
than for me
to explain it.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.456
Huh, the old
carrot and stick, huh?

18:42.664 --> 18:44.917
Whatever it takes, Jasper.
Just keep trying.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.252
What's Monty's
favorite color?

18:47.461 --> 18:50.089
Green.
It's a joke.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.092
275 iterations,
not it.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.593
Favorite book.

18:54.802 --> 18:56.095
"Catcher
in the rye."

18:56.303 --> 18:57.429
Where do those
ducks go, anyway?

18:57.638 --> 18:59.056
Keep trying.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.349
Favorite place.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.517
Down here
or up there?

19:01.725 --> 19:03.435
Either. Both.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.020
Starboard
window bay.

19:05.229 --> 19:06.396
It has the best view
of the moon

19:06.605 --> 19:08.899
on the whole damn ship,
and we used to get

19:09.108 --> 19:10.776
a little baked,
just sit back,

19:10.984 --> 19:13.403
watch the sky
playing, um,

19:13.612 --> 19:15.614
"on which planet
would you rather?"

19:15.823 --> 19:20.160
Answer was always earth.
We were such dumbasses.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.912
That's it.

19:22.121 --> 19:23.872
- What?
- What?

19:24.081 --> 19:25.541
The code is an
alphanumeric sequence

19:25.749 --> 19:27.918
representing
the word "earth."

19:28.127 --> 19:30.337
Good job, Jasper.

19:30.546 --> 19:32.840
Looks like Monty was thinking
about the same window you were.

19:37.302 --> 19:41.515
Hey, uh, presuming
we don't get caught

19:41.723 --> 19:45.144
or killed, I'm first
in line for a chip, OK?

19:55.946 --> 19:58.073
Find anything?

19:58.282 --> 20:00.075
Electronics
are intact.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.952
We must've
caught Sinclair

20:02.161 --> 20:04.037
before he could
do any damage.

20:04.246 --> 20:08.041
I know this must
be hard for you.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.669
Sinclair recruited me
into engineering.

20:10.878 --> 20:13.714
He was my mentor,
and now

20:13.922 --> 20:15.966
I just helped
lock him up.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.930
You did
the right thing.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.682
Yeah?

20:26.560 --> 20:28.604
I'm not so sure
about that.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.564
Monty, being down here,
I've learned

20:30.772 --> 20:33.859
that if something
helps you survive,

20:34.067 --> 20:37.446
it's always
the right thing.

20:37.654 --> 20:41.116
Pike taught me that,
taught all of us.

20:41.325 --> 20:45.162
It's what
kept us alive.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.916
You do what it takes.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.547
Come on.

20:59.676 --> 21:00.636
- Good?
- Yeah.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.889
Right.
You're in there.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.515
Uh!

21:05.724 --> 21:06.642
Get
this off.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.394
Uh! Uh!

21:14.983 --> 21:17.861
Locking
their own up now.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.614
What'd you do
to get in here?

21:20.822 --> 21:24.159
Whatever it took.

21:24.368 --> 21:26.828
I have a message
for you from Kane.

21:27.037 --> 21:31.541
Get ready.
Tonight's a go.

21:54.773 --> 21:59.236
Wasn't much of a plan,
sabotaging the rover.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.906
Keeping an eye on Sinclair
was an easy call.

22:03.115 --> 22:06.285
Was it?

22:06.493 --> 22:09.162
Spying on your friend,
that was easy?

22:11.999 --> 22:15.919
People in camp
were losing focus.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.462
There's a threat
outside these walls--

22:17.671 --> 22:21.341
the threat's
inside the walls.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.469
Can't you see that?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.392
Pike's turning us
against each other.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.394
He's the chancellor.
Have you forgotten that?

22:32.602 --> 22:35.063
No. No. I haven't.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.566
Then do
the right thing.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.234
That's the problem.

22:39.443 --> 22:43.405
No matter how
I look at it, I am.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.742
Really? Because
the way I see it,

22:46.950 --> 22:48.702
Monroe died
because of you.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.580
And now pike's
locked up Sinclair.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.624
You don't think he'll
be the next to die?

22:57.794 --> 22:59.254
Of course not.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.590
Think about
where this ends--

23:01.798 --> 23:03.467
half the camp
behind bars

23:03.675 --> 23:06.386
while the other half
starves.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.305
People won't
stand for it.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.807
They'll turn
against pike,

23:11.016 --> 23:13.727
but by then,
it'll be too late.

23:13.935 --> 23:14.895
Pike has a plan.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.688
Pike's always
got a plan,

23:16.897 --> 23:19.399
and it's always
the same one--

23:19.608 --> 23:20.609
take the fight
to the grounders.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.277
That's what got
Monroe killed.

23:22.486 --> 23:23.612
You're crossing
a line, Kane.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.698
No. No.
I crossed it.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.953
I asked you here

23:32.162 --> 23:35.749
because I hoped
you'd join me.

23:37.793 --> 23:40.212
It's still
not too late

23:40.420 --> 23:42.255
to choose
the right side.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.761
That's exactly what
I came here to tell you.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.404
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.955
Want to explain
to me

24:15.163 --> 24:17.666
why we don't work
the same detail anymore?

24:17.874 --> 24:20.752
Well, you like days.
I like nights.

24:20.961 --> 24:23.296
Told you I'd switch.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.881
Didn't you say you're
gonna talk to Bellamy?

24:25.090 --> 24:27.342
Yeah. Just haven't
had the time.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.845
Yeah.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.888
I noticed you haven't
been around much lately.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.395
Nate...

24:40.730 --> 24:42.482
What's going on?

24:42.691 --> 24:44.359
Nothing.

24:44.568 --> 24:46.111
Something.

24:48.572 --> 24:50.574
You know what it is.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.701
Pike?

24:52.909 --> 24:54.077
- Again?
- You asked.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.579
Hey, I keep telling you,
if you don't like

24:55.787 --> 24:57.372
the man's policies,
just get off the guard.

24:57.581 --> 24:58.999
Now is not the best
time for that.

24:59.207 --> 25:01.376
Yeah? Why not?

25:01.585 --> 25:03.795
There's a blockade
outside of camp,

25:04.004 --> 25:05.297
food rationing inside,
jail full of grounders.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.675
There's a lot for people
to be upset about right now.

25:12.387 --> 25:15.140
This--this is--
this is all

25:15.348 --> 25:17.851
the more reason to stand
behind your chancellor.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.695
I got to go.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.956
Here.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.397
So the bug's
in place?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.359
It's in his jacket.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.319
I don't think
he knows.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.321
Good man.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.532
Am I?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.742
Is this--is--
is any of this

26:15.951 --> 26:17.536
worth lying
to someone I love?

26:19.454 --> 26:21.456
It is if you're
protecting him.

26:21.665 --> 26:24.584
Unless the person he needs
protection from is me.

26:26.711 --> 26:27.796
South
hallway's clear.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.130
East is, too.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.423
Knowing Monty,
that password

26:30.632 --> 26:31.841
will automatically
reset in 5 minutes, so--

26:32.050 --> 26:33.593
let's make
the most of it.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.845
Yeah. Yeah.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.389
Guess we are as smart
as we think we are.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.349
Right. Pike doesn't
have a safe, so--

26:39.558 --> 26:43.311
Jaha's little chip-maker's
got to be here somewhere.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.775
This is all
pretty crazy, huh--

26:48.984 --> 26:51.111
grounders at the gate,
an ultimatum,

26:51.319 --> 26:53.822
one life
to spare us all.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.824
How's that different from
any other day around here?

26:56.032 --> 26:59.119
It's just, we've
been here before...

27:01.329 --> 27:03.665
You know, with Finn.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.636
You remember that,
right?

27:16.845 --> 27:18.722
I mean, I--I was
in mount weather,

27:18.930 --> 27:21.224
but you--you
remember Finn dying

27:21.433 --> 27:23.101
when Clarke killed--

27:23.310 --> 27:25.353
I entered the city of light
to relieve my pain.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.439
Why would
I remember that?

27:27.647 --> 27:30.066
Less talking, more looking,
OK, Jasper?

27:30.275 --> 27:31.693
I think
it's a good thing

27:31.901 --> 27:33.612
you can't remember
the bad stuff.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.197
That's what
I want to forget.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.951
If I could wake up one
morning without thinking

27:40.160 --> 27:42.412
about Maya dying,

27:42.621 --> 27:45.332
if I could only remember
the good stuff,

27:45.540 --> 27:48.418
like holding her hand
for the first time

27:48.627 --> 27:51.921
and listening to
our favorite music,

27:52.130 --> 27:55.759
you know, like when Finn
gave you that necklace--

28:00.639 --> 28:02.641
is that
how it works,

28:02.849 --> 28:05.060
you can think
of your first kiss

28:05.268 --> 28:07.896
and just be happy?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.357
Of course.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.488
My first kiss.

28:19.366 --> 28:21.284
That's not
important now.

28:21.493 --> 28:22.702
Our mission is to--

28:22.911 --> 28:23.870
when was
my first kiss?

28:24.079 --> 28:26.581
What? I don't know.
Don't you?

28:26.790 --> 28:29.668
- I can't remember.
- I got it.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.546
- All right. Give it to me.
- Good work.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.049
Then go.

28:40.387 --> 28:42.597
Take it and go.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.232
I don't remember.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.817
Raven?

28:54.025 --> 28:56.319
Finn was real.

28:56.528 --> 28:59.239
- I--
- loved him, right?

28:59.447 --> 29:01.866
- What's going on?
- Raven, you need to go.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.160
I don't remember anything
about him at all.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.670
We can't let her
have this. Run.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.105
Give us a minute.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.817
Marcus.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.986
Thank you
for meeting me.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.280
I hope you're
ready to negotiate

29:40.488 --> 29:43.366
the terms and conditions
of your surrender.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.290
He says he's
ready to talk.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.303
You have
something to say?

30:03.511 --> 30:05.764
What do you
want to know?

30:05.972 --> 30:08.475
Everything.

30:08.683 --> 30:11.811
On the ark,
you taught your students

30:12.020 --> 30:14.314
about the promise
of our future,

30:14.522 --> 30:16.483
about the responsibility

30:16.691 --> 30:18.359
our descendents
would bear

30:18.568 --> 30:20.195
when they finally
set foot on the ground.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.197
We didn't
start this war,

30:22.405 --> 30:24.991
but you can be damn sure
I intend to finish it.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.743
I want immunity.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.912
I'm the chief engineer,
and this camp needs me.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.122
That's up to pike, but
it shouldn't be a problem.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.292
What happened
to you, Charles?

30:34.501 --> 30:36.920
You committed
treason.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.546
You acted against
your own people.

30:38.755 --> 30:39.881
Don't stand there
and try

30:40.089 --> 30:41.299
and take the high
road with me.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.134
- It's demeaning.
- I did nothing wrong.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.762
Nothing that
I can prove yet.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.680
Sinclair
will give you up.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.266
It's only
a matter of time.

30:50.475 --> 30:52.352
It's over, Marcus.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.354
Is it?

30:54.562 --> 30:56.189
What do
you got?

30:56.397 --> 30:59.442
So...The cowards
make their deals

30:59.651 --> 31:01.194
to save
their own skin.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.196
Quiet.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.031
Can't defeat the
army at the gate,

31:05.240 --> 31:06.449
so you turn
on your own?

31:06.658 --> 31:07.659
Make you
feel strong?

31:07.867 --> 31:08.993
I said,
be quiet.

31:09.202 --> 31:11.955
I'm not the one who
needs to be silenced.

31:12.163 --> 31:15.250
You'll tell them
nothing.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.252
- Uh!
- Lincoln!

31:17.460 --> 31:18.795
Cover me.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.089
Uh! Uh!

31:21.297 --> 31:23.550
Kom nau!

31:40.400 --> 31:42.235
All available
guards to lock-up.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.153
- Go.
- Sir.

31:50.285 --> 31:53.246
I don't suppose you know
anything about this.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.373
As a matter
of fact, I do.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.626
Aagh!

31:58.835 --> 32:00.670
Uh! Ah!

32:00.879 --> 32:03.047
Agh...

32:08.344 --> 32:10.597
You left me no choice.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.270
Rrgh...Ah!

32:25.528 --> 32:26.571
Yaagh!

32:33.786 --> 32:36.289
It worked. We're clear.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.708
The guards
have their hands full.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.126
Is the gate open?

32:40.335 --> 32:42.337
Miller, on radio:
Waiting on you.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.922
Bellamy, come in.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.299
Bellamy!

32:48.343 --> 32:50.261
Miller, on radio:
Cargo locked and loaded?

32:50.470 --> 32:52.931
Affirmative.
On the move.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.562
Aagh!

33:07.070 --> 33:08.029
Uh! Uh!

33:09.781 --> 33:12.200
Bellamy,
the riot's a distraction.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.077
Kane's going in
for pike.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.896
Get the hell out of the way,
Bellamy!

33:43.272 --> 33:46.526
Should've
killed me yourself.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.820
This has never happened
to me before.

34:31.029 --> 34:33.031
When I communicate
with someone,

34:33.239 --> 34:34.949
they listen to me.

34:35.158 --> 34:38.036
They agree
with me.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.120
Raven--

34:39.328 --> 34:42.623
is strong,
and she's not alone.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.711
Free will and the need
for consent

34:46.919 --> 34:49.380
are part of my
core programming.

34:49.589 --> 34:52.133
I cannot
override them.

34:52.341 --> 34:55.094
I know that,

34:55.303 --> 34:57.346
but maybe I can.

34:59.932 --> 35:04.312
As you know,
the terms of martial law

35:04.520 --> 35:07.565
and of the exodus charter
give me both latitude

35:07.774 --> 35:11.986
and ultimate authority
in determining your punishment.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.241
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.913
I admire

35:22.121 --> 35:24.707
your adherence
to the rule of law--

35:24.916 --> 35:26.959
I really do--

35:27.168 --> 35:29.420
but these are times
when we have to look

35:29.629 --> 35:31.464
beyond the rules...

35:33.257 --> 35:36.636
To realize
they were established

35:36.844 --> 35:39.931
to serve a world
of the past,

35:40.139 --> 35:41.974
not of the future.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.437
I beg you one last time...

35:48.940 --> 35:55.071
To see the world
as it is, not as it was

35:55.279 --> 35:57.448
or as you
want it to be.

35:57.657 --> 36:00.952
And I hope
you believe...

36:03.162 --> 36:06.457
That if I thought
for one minute

36:06.666 --> 36:09.877
that turning myself
over to the enemy

36:10.086 --> 36:12.630
would secure the safety
of our people...

36:17.051 --> 36:19.512
I would do it...

36:21.180 --> 36:23.724
But only a deluded man
would believe that...

36:25.810 --> 36:29.021
And only a guilty man
would try and tell him so.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.696
Marcus Kane,

36:36.904 --> 36:39.949
for the crimes
of treason,

36:40.158 --> 36:42.702
kidnapping, and
attempted murder,

36:42.910 --> 36:46.914
I hereby sentence
you to death.

36:47.123 --> 36:49.542
Take him.

37:10.646 --> 37:12.690
Sir...

37:14.108 --> 37:17.820
Are we really killing
our own people now?

37:19.947 --> 37:22.074
We're at war.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.703
Crimes against
our leadership

37:25.912 --> 37:28.414
can't be tolerated.

37:28.623 --> 37:32.251
So Kane dies
to be an example.

37:33.461 --> 37:35.755
Kane's actions

37:35.963 --> 37:37.215
put this whole camp,

37:38.424 --> 37:40.885
everyone's lives
at risk today.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.972
He costs us lives in
his misguided zeal

37:45.181 --> 37:47.850
to appease our enemy,
people you knew.

37:48.059 --> 37:50.311
Your friends died
because of him.

37:50.519 --> 37:52.230
Am I making him
an example?

37:52.438 --> 37:54.649
You're damn right,
and I hope

37:54.857 --> 37:56.817
his execution
makes it clear

37:57.026 --> 37:58.611
once and for all
where people's

37:58.819 --> 38:01.822
allegiances
need to lie.

38:02.031 --> 38:06.327
Do you
understand that?

38:12.041 --> 38:14.418
Good man.

38:16.254 --> 38:18.381

What about Miller
and Harper?

40:14.205 --> 40:15.831
Nicely done
today.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.666
I'm proud
of both of you.

40:19.043 --> 40:21.212
Thanks, mom.

40:22.922 --> 40:24.799
Were you able
to identify

40:25.007 --> 40:26.967
anyone Kane
was working with?

40:27.176 --> 40:29.136
No.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.691
Let's hope
today's actions

40:42.900 --> 40:44.777
make it clear to the
people of Arkadia

40:44.985 --> 40:46.946
which side they
should be on.

40:50.658 --> 40:53.202
It's not
really that hard,

40:53.411 --> 40:56.163
choosing what's best
for your people, is it?

40:56.372 --> 40:58.707
No.

40:58.916 --> 41:01.460
I do it every day.
