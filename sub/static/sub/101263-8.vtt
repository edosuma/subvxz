well, I can't just
let you go off alone.

31:20.930 --> 31:22.346
You can stay with me.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.315
No.

31:25.434 --> 31:27.150
I said I wouldn't let this
touch you or jane,

31:27.269 --> 31:28.268
and-and I meant it.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.137
(sighs)

31:31.240 --> 31:33.139
where will you go?

31:33.242 --> 31:36.276
I'm exhausted. I... Just
want one more night in my house.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.145
I'll figure it out tomorrow.

31:39.248 --> 31:41.365
Call me when you get settled?

31:43.369 --> 31:45.085
Okay.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.173
You'd think,
after all these years...

31:52.177 --> 31:54.261
...I'd have more things
I really cared about.

32:06.308 --> 32:08.058
Everybody else...

32:10.112 --> 32:12.279
...Got their head in the sand...

32:16.402 --> 32:22.372
...And you stand up
straight and tall.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.248
You got so much more than most.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.007
I am so proud of you, baby.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.179
Thank you.

32:59.028 --> 33:00.944
(door opens)

33:02.998 --> 33:04.281
-manboy: Hold up. She did what?
<i> -Tanosse (over phone): Shot up</i>

33:04.366 --> 33:07.167
<i> a fucking funeral, drew,</i>
<i> while I was there.</i>

33:07.252 --> 33:10.003
-She hit anybody?
<i> -She could've got me.</i>

33:10.089 --> 33:12.873
-So she did?
<i> -They got louie.</i>

33:12.958 --> 33:15.175
She alive,
but it don't look good.

33:15.260 --> 33:18.178
(sighs) jerome about
to be on the warpath.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.847
<i> If you want me</i>
<i> to get you their connect,</i>

33:20.933 --> 33:23.183
you got to get your sister
to stand the fuck down.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.251
You don't think I tried that?

33:25.354 --> 33:28.922
(sighs)
shit.

33:29.024 --> 33:31.108
All right, look.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.060
Uh, might be a way
I can get this done.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.146
So do it then. What the fuck
is you still talking to me for?

33:39.034 --> 33:42.285
Call loc and twin. Tell them
bring their uzis and rounds.

33:42.404 --> 33:44.905
We gonna have
some company tonight.

33:47.076 --> 33:49.042
(door closes)

33:55.134 --> 33:56.833
havemeyer:
We need to talk.

33:56.919 --> 33:58.284
Yeah, we do.

33:58.387 --> 34:01.088
Things in nicaragua
are a lot worse than we thought.

34:01.173 --> 34:05.058
Later. We got a bigger problem.

34:08.097 --> 34:10.063
(indistinct announcement
over p.A.)

34:12.317 --> 34:14.935
hey, where you going?

34:15.020 --> 34:16.269
Jerome:
Get some air.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.105
You want me to roll with you?

34:25.197 --> 34:26.363
(franklin clears throat)

34:32.287 --> 34:34.287
(grunts)

34:43.298 --> 34:47.934
I can't believe we're back
in this hospital.

34:48.020 --> 34:51.138
Another one of ours
fighting to survive.

34:54.276 --> 34:56.860
Well, we got through that.

34:56.979 --> 34:59.012
Hmm?

34:59.114 --> 35:01.064
And we'll get through this.

35:06.955 --> 35:10.190
Willy childress came to see me.

35:10.292 --> 35:12.192
He returned our money.

35:12.294 --> 35:14.961
Paul davis is out. It's over.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.051
God. Those motherfuckers, man.

35:21.170 --> 35:23.086
They just scared.

35:23.172 --> 35:24.971
-I just... (stammers)
-so am I, franklin.

35:25.057 --> 35:27.140
Yeah, but this is all gonna
blow over, you know,

35:27.226 --> 35:29.142
and then they gonna come
crawling back.

35:29.228 --> 35:31.311
And if they don't, then there's
other investors, right?

35:31.396 --> 35:34.264
No reputable businessperson
is gonna get into bed with us.

35:34.349 --> 35:37.901
Not after all of this.
The article?

35:39.938 --> 35:42.823
We're never gonna be legitimate.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.858
(sighs)

35:46.945 --> 35:48.328
(pager beeping)

35:49.364 --> 35:51.064
(whispers):
Finally.

35:51.166 --> 35:54.067
Look, uh, I got to,
um... I-I got to go.

35:54.169 --> 35:57.037
Look, um...
We'll talk another time.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.906
-Love you.
-I'm moving out of the house.

36:00.008 --> 36:00.957
What?

36:03.011 --> 36:05.045
You moving out the house?

36:06.381 --> 36:10.083
(chuckles)
and going where?

36:10.185 --> 36:11.268
I don't know yet.

36:12.387 --> 36:15.272
-Away from south central.
-Not with alton?

36:18.193 --> 36:20.894
No, not with alton.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.099
I'm done getting caught
between the two of you.

36:26.201 --> 36:30.036
No longer a mother
and wife first.

36:30.122 --> 36:32.906
Start taking care of myself.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.132
Look, at least...

36:44.303 --> 36:47.003
Give me a few hours, okay?

36:47.089 --> 36:49.089
I'll be back in a little while,

36:49.174 --> 36:52.058
and-and we'll take care
of all of this.

36:52.144 --> 36:54.094
Promise. Okay?

36:55.931 --> 36:58.064
Huh?

36:58.150 --> 37:00.100
(indistinct announcement
over p.A.)

37:05.107 --> 37:07.274
(grunts)

37:07.359 --> 37:09.809
(franklin sighs)

37:09.912 --> 37:11.861
watch over jerome.

37:20.956 --> 37:22.956
-(franklin grunting)
-(distant sirens wailing)

37:26.929 --> 37:28.845
franklin:
Where the fuck you been?

37:28.964 --> 37:30.096
Drunk in a ditch somewhere?

37:30.182 --> 37:31.097
Teddy:
Doesn't matter where I've been.

37:31.183 --> 37:33.350
How the fuck
did you let that happen?

37:35.304 --> 37:37.137
How do you think it happened?

37:37.222 --> 37:39.856
-My pops figured it out.
-Yeah!

37:39.975 --> 37:41.191
And then he told some
fucking reporter about it?

37:41.310 --> 37:43.193
-And you had no idea
that this was coming?
-Wh-what?

37:43.312 --> 37:45.011
He's my fucking father, man.

37:45.113 --> 37:46.896
I thought I could trust him.

37:48.984 --> 37:50.817
What is that, blood?

37:53.322 --> 37:57.240
Yeah.

37:57.326 --> 37:59.859
Louie got hit.

37:59.962 --> 38:01.911
What? Wait, what?

38:05.133 --> 38:07.000
Is she all right?

38:07.085 --> 38:08.918
She's in surgery.

38:10.055 --> 38:13.923
Doctors say it's... A coin flip.

38:14.009 --> 38:16.009
I'm sorry.

38:17.312 --> 38:20.880
But if we don't stop this,
there is no tomorrow.

38:20.983 --> 38:22.182
That's the reality.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.150
Now, I got my people
working on stopping

38:24.236 --> 38:27.821
the second part from being
published, but we have to get

38:27.906 --> 38:29.222
-this reporter under control.
-Already tried.

38:29.324 --> 38:32.058
-What does that mean?
-It means I met up with her.

38:33.195 --> 38:34.995
Tried to get her to understand
that she's fucking around

38:35.080 --> 38:38.064
with the wrong people.
Look, you was gone.

38:38.166 --> 38:40.233
Okay? You was gone. I had to try
something. I had no choice.

38:40.335 --> 38:42.902
All right, all right.
All right, all right, all right.

38:43.005 --> 38:44.921
How did she take it?

38:45.040 --> 38:47.907
Well, she ain't soft.

38:48.010 --> 38:51.878
I don't think empty threats
gonna get the job done.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.881
All right. I'll take care
of her from here on out.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.800
What I need from you

38:56.885 --> 38:58.968
is to put a muzzle
on your father.

38:59.054 --> 39:01.921
Is that something
that you can do?

39:02.024 --> 39:04.858
Uh-huh.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.946
I thought for sure
this was over.

39:11.066 --> 39:13.066
That you'd cut me loose.
(chuckles)

39:13.151 --> 39:15.118
never hear from you again.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.106
Well, I told you
I'd be there with you.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.958
You remember?

39:22.077 --> 39:23.993
I will.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.836
But listen to me.

39:32.921 --> 39:34.254
From here on,

39:34.339 --> 39:37.223
you just can't trust anyone.

39:37.309 --> 39:39.959
Because
when push comes to shove,

39:40.062 --> 39:42.929
all anybody cares about
is saving themselves.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.102
You know that.

39:51.239 --> 39:53.139
(car door opens, closes)

39:53.241 --> 39:54.324
(engine starts)

39:58.663 --> 40:00.630
(siren wailing)

40:09.474 --> 40:11.424
(indistinct chatter)

40:12.594 --> 40:15.428
franklin:
Louie.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.479
Out of surgery.

40:16.598 --> 40:18.581
They say they got her stable.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.650
Thank god.

40:22.437 --> 40:23.770
Mom inside?

40:23.855 --> 40:26.639
She left as soon as she
found out louie was cool, so...

40:26.741 --> 40:28.691
-Nurse: Jerome?
-Yeah.

40:28.777 --> 40:30.810
Nurse:
You want to come on back?

40:30.912 --> 40:33.696
Y'all get ready. The minute
I finish sitting with her,

40:33.782 --> 40:35.782
we gonna get
these motherfuckers.

40:38.453 --> 40:39.536
(sighs)

40:39.621 --> 40:41.421
I've been paging you.

40:42.591 --> 40:45.291
My bad, I was... Busy.

40:45.377 --> 40:47.343
What do you have?

40:48.380 --> 40:50.513
Black diamond and dallas.

40:50.632 --> 40:52.599
That's who khadijah was with.

40:54.386 --> 40:56.519
Never heard of 'em.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.355
Used to be dancers,
if you can believe that shit.

40:59.474 --> 41:01.524
Now they straight hustlers.

41:01.643 --> 41:03.393
In it for the cash.

41:03.478 --> 41:05.344
But they're dangerous.

41:05.447 --> 41:07.480
(franklin sighs)

41:07.566 --> 41:10.516
and something else I heard
while I was asking around.

41:10.619 --> 41:11.784
Uh-huh?

41:11.870 --> 41:14.520
You know manboy been
after your plug?

41:14.623 --> 41:16.706
Everybody want the hookup.
It ain't no secret.

41:16.825 --> 41:20.693
Yeah, but apparently drew been
leaning into it heavy.

41:20.795 --> 41:22.745
Boy borderline obsessed.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.584
Drew has, huh?

41:27.669 --> 41:29.469
Yeah.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.537
Where you going with this?

41:32.757 --> 41:36.426
I thought if you wanted to avoid
a war, there might be a way.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.546
Make a deal with manboy.

41:40.649 --> 41:42.599
Agree to offer him the plug.

41:42.684 --> 41:45.318
In exchange,
he talks khadijah down.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.386
Brokers peace.

41:47.489 --> 41:49.689
Leon:
Tianna was his niece.

41:49.774 --> 41:53.359
You think he gonna let
that shit go for a plug?

41:53.445 --> 41:54.744
Y'all know drew.

41:54.863 --> 41:56.696
He a businessman.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.666
Ain't nothing more important
to him than his money.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.452
And he's the only person
on this earth

42:02.537 --> 42:05.371
who might be able
to talk khadijah down.

42:08.510 --> 42:10.376
Let me think on it, hmm?

42:10.462 --> 42:11.427
Mm-hmm.

42:11.546 --> 42:13.513
(franklin clears throat)

42:17.636 --> 42:19.686
even if that motherfucker agree,

42:19.771 --> 42:21.420
if he get the plug,

42:21.523 --> 42:23.356
we can't trust
he gonna keep his word.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.391
No, we can't.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.611
Can't trust any of it.

42:30.532 --> 42:32.431
(chuckles)

42:32.534 --> 42:34.484
-fuck.
-What?

42:36.738 --> 42:39.572
Whatever happens,
keep jerome here.

42:39.658 --> 42:41.624
All right? I'll be back.

42:41.743 --> 42:43.710
Okay.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.752

42:56.841 --> 42:58.808
Go get the car.

43:18.530 --> 43:21.531

43:22.701 --> 43:25.501
all right.

43:25.620 --> 43:28.421
Head home and make the call.

43:28.506 --> 43:31.674
Tell drew I'll make the deal.

43:31.793 --> 43:34.493
