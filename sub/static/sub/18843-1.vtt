01:31.382 --> 01:34.180
If they only were Rudy,
I wouldn't take another step.

01:34.251 --> 01:35.616
But there's only one Rudy.

01:35.686 --> 01:37.244
She's a bit of all right.

01:37.321 --> 01:39.915
She's driving me completely mad,
that's for sure.

01:40.524 --> 01:42.287
Just one Rudy...

01:43.227 --> 01:45.957
...and so many millions
and millions of us.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.337
Let's get out of here!

01:55.472 --> 01:57.463
Hurry up, Mac! They're coming!

01:58.275 --> 01:59.503
Here they come!

02:01.011 --> 02:02.035
Hurry!

02:03.613 --> 02:04.910
Be my sheba and ride with me...

02:04.981 --> 02:06.471
- Yes, yes, yes!
...over the sand dunes.

02:06.549 --> 02:09.245
Kiss me, Rudy!
Kiss me quickly!

02:17.060 --> 02:19.585
God, I could've loved her.

02:19.662 --> 02:20.856
I could've, too.

02:21.864 --> 02:25.493
Do you realize that tomorrow
we are finally free?

02:25.568 --> 02:28.662
We can actually ride
across the sand dunes and be loved.

02:28.738 --> 02:31.366
Actually lie down and be loved.

02:31.441 --> 02:34.672
We're so overdue,
as we both know too well.

02:34.744 --> 02:36.268
Everything in its time, Mac.

02:36.346 --> 02:40.476
We are now possibly the most
overeducated young women in the country.

02:40.550 --> 02:43.542
But in the ways of love,
we're kindergarten toddlers!

02:43.619 --> 02:45.814
Cat, fantastic idea...

02:45.888 --> 02:48.686
let's not start
our graduation trip in Paris.

02:48.758 --> 02:49.918
- God.
- No.

02:49.992 --> 02:52.824
Let's start... I love this...

02:52.894 --> 02:57.160
let's start by galloping across
the burning sand dunes of Morocco

02:57.232 --> 02:59.757
in the arms of a real sheik!

03:00.402 --> 03:03.701
Yes. We can spend our nights
learning of ecstasy.

03:04.673 --> 03:07.267
What a beautiful word... ecstasy.

03:07.342 --> 03:10.778
- E-X-T...
- No, no, no.

03:10.846 --> 03:13.576
- E-C-S-T...
- Let's go wallow in it!

03:13.648 --> 03:15.377
Mac, I don't know.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.213
No... you're serious?

03:17.285 --> 03:18.877
Do the backstroke in it!

03:18.954 --> 03:21.081
- You are serious.
- Then you'll go?

03:21.156 --> 03:22.487
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

03:22.557 --> 03:24.491
Good! I don't like choices.

03:26.628 --> 03:29.119
Congratulations to you, Miss Pipps.

03:29.831 --> 03:31.526
Tomorrow the Sahara.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.534
Blood on the sand.

03:41.009 --> 03:43.135
Well done, Miss McGillvary.

03:50.551 --> 03:53.076
Cotton, stop the car.
Stop the car!

03:55.489 --> 03:56.615
I'm sorry.

03:56.690 --> 03:59.682
I just have to do something
that I've been dreaming about for years.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.852
I'm sorry.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.268
Who's that?

05:18.338 --> 05:20.898
I believe that's the attorney.

05:20.974 --> 05:23.203
What's he so happy about?

05:23.275 --> 05:25.766
He probably liked the entertainment.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.980
Cotton, I'm so sorry.

05:30.048 --> 05:32.016
I've embarrassed you.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.389
How awful for you.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.650
But, you see, I just had to do this.

05:41.727 --> 05:44.958
I had so many years
of being so very, very proper,

05:45.030 --> 05:47.260
I got claustrophobia!

05:48.734 --> 05:50.361
You're terribly embarrassed.

05:50.435 --> 05:52.596
Can you ever forgive me?

05:52.671 --> 05:54.502
That's not my position.

05:54.573 --> 05:56.473
Not your position?

05:56.542 --> 05:58.066
No, miss.

05:59.912 --> 06:02.210
You mean because you drive
that great big car

06:02.281 --> 06:05.182
you cannot not forgive a person
for something?

06:05.250 --> 06:08.014
That more or less covers it.

06:08.086 --> 06:09.986
Because you drive the car?

06:10.055 --> 06:11.784
Yes.

06:11.857 --> 06:13.323
Then I'll drive the car.

06:13.391 --> 06:16.883
Now, you can or cannot forgive me?

06:17.662 --> 06:19.129
You'll drive the car?

06:19.196 --> 06:21.494
Does that mean that I'm fired?

06:22.400 --> 06:25.028
If that's what it takes
to allow you to answer.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.967
I haven't been without a job
since I was 13 years old.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.874
Okay, okay.
What was the question?

06:34.946 --> 06:38.313
Oh, yes. Do I forgive you
for having embarrassed me?

06:38.382 --> 06:40.043
That was the question.

06:40.117 --> 06:42.051
At first, I was puzzled.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.417
Then, well, then...

06:44.488 --> 06:46.820
- You were embarrassed.
- No.

06:46.891 --> 06:48.722
I'm glad.

06:48.793 --> 06:51.353
No, I was amazed
at how much you'd changed

06:51.429 --> 06:53.989
since the last time I saw you
without any clothes.

06:54.098 --> 06:58.728
- Without any cl...
- I think you were three or four.

06:58.803 --> 07:00.100
You've grown well.

07:00.171 --> 07:02.468
I think that was nicely said.

07:03.073 --> 07:06.042
Now, would you like your old job back?

07:06.610 --> 07:08.202
Is it still available?

07:08.278 --> 07:11.577
It is if you'll be my friend
and talk to me.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.707
I haven't much to say.

07:13.783 --> 07:15.114
But you'll say it?

07:17.954 --> 07:19.888
Let's get the hell out of here.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.224
He's a pretty spiffy-looking attorney.

07:28.798 --> 07:33.326
I believe today's the day
I become an excessively rich little bitch.

07:33.403 --> 07:35.268
You'll still be my friend, Cotton.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.329
If that's the only way
I can keep my job.

07:37.407 --> 07:38.931
That's the only way.

07:39.809 --> 07:41.970
A pretty tough way to keep a job.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.809
Well, I'm told life is not easy.

07:47.283 --> 07:48.375
Hi.

07:49.252 --> 07:52.345
Miss Ayre McGillvary,
I am Robert Stewart,

07:52.421 --> 07:55.083
one of your late father's army
of solicitors.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.387
I mean you no disrespect...

07:57.459 --> 07:59.324
not at all, to the contrary...

07:59.395 --> 08:01.260
but I wish when I had graduated,

08:01.330 --> 08:03.525
I'd been cheeky enough to do
what you did.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.066
Bloody marvelous.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.801
I give you my diploma,
and you give me what?

08:14.009 --> 08:15.704
Gee whiz, it's Cotton.

08:16.779 --> 08:19.543
I think I own the whole world.

08:19.615 --> 08:21.810
Well, at least all the good parts of it.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.847
Now we must watch our steps,
in every sense of the word,

08:26.922 --> 08:29.447
as we wind our way to the casbah.

08:29.525 --> 08:30.549
Come.

08:30.626 --> 08:32.821
We should have a policeman with us.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.696
Don't you think we should have
a policeman with us?

08:35.764 --> 08:37.254
They wouldn't be welcome here.

08:37.332 --> 08:40.096
Actually, it is more dangerous
for them than for you.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.294
Life is not without its risks,

08:42.370 --> 08:45.464
compounded, of course, a bit more
here in the casbah.

08:45.540 --> 08:48.202
Hey, Mohammed!
Look, look, look, look!

08:51.112 --> 08:52.773
I am still eh-scared.

08:52.847 --> 08:55.407
Oh, Cat! I'll protect you
with my life if necessary.

08:55.483 --> 08:57.280
Protect me?
You're half naked.

08:57.351 --> 08:59.046
They will get you first.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.020
No. No... They'll what?

09:01.089 --> 09:03.023
Make you no more a virgin.

09:03.091 --> 09:05.252
Well, isn't that what we're here for?

09:06.227 --> 09:12.393
This door... it may this very night
hold in its bosom your sheik.

09:13.668 --> 09:14.896
Shall we see?

09:15.636 --> 09:19.470
We can ask Allah
for one authentic sheik.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.440
Two, if he would be so kind.

09:43.363 --> 09:45.354
I like that.

09:47.634 --> 09:49.067
Don't you like that, Cat?

09:50.937 --> 09:52.165
I like that.

09:52.239 --> 09:53.831
Yeah, I like it.

09:53.907 --> 09:54.931
Come.

10:12.425 --> 10:14.518
So sweet.

10:19.065 --> 10:20.396
Sweet!

10:21.134 --> 10:22.862
He's beautiful.

10:27.139 --> 10:29.198
Catalina, look.

10:29.275 --> 10:31.209
- Mac, look at that!
- Look!

10:35.414 --> 10:36.779
What do the camels do?

10:37.683 --> 10:38.843
They are for sale.

10:39.852 --> 10:42.013
Cotton, wouldn't you just love one?

10:43.088 --> 10:44.817
"Love" may be too strong a word.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.349
Allah is kind.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.155
Miss, your sheik.

10:49.228 --> 10:50.490
Miss, your sheik!

10:50.563 --> 10:51.621
A sheik?

10:51.697 --> 10:53.460
Yes. He is a young one.

10:53.532 --> 10:55.432
A pup, you might say.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.268
He comes from the south,

10:59.338 --> 11:02.068
across uncountable miles of sand.

11:02.141 --> 11:06.100
His father... his father's a great pasha.

11:06.178 --> 11:09.477
- Catalina, do you see him?
- No.

11:09.548 --> 11:10.845
Well, look!

11:13.818 --> 11:15.217
He could be your sister.

11:18.723 --> 11:22.454
Miss, would you like
to meet the sheik now?

11:24.696 --> 11:26.027
I'll wait here, thank you.

11:26.097 --> 11:27.496
If you'll stay with me, Cotton.

11:27.565 --> 11:29.192
We'll stay here.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.132
You're not gonna pass on a real sheik!

11:31.202 --> 11:32.396
There is only one.

11:32.470 --> 11:36.566
Being beginners, that's probably
enough for both of us right now.

11:36.641 --> 11:40.270
But if you're too "eh-scared,"
I'll brave this one myself.

11:40.345 --> 11:41.710
Okay.

11:41.779 --> 11:43.144
We wait?

11:43.715 --> 11:44.773
Go.

12:04.868 --> 12:10.773
Honorable Sheik, allow me
to introduce this American lady to you.

12:10.841 --> 12:14.436
She has come all the way
from her country just to meet you.

12:14.978 --> 12:16.707
How do you do?

12:19.416 --> 12:21.384
Well, thank you.
And you?

12:22.486 --> 12:24.784
You are a vision.

12:26.757 --> 12:27.985
Thank you.

12:28.058 --> 12:29.548
You may go now.

12:29.626 --> 12:31.355
Miss McGillvary?

12:31.428 --> 12:32.918
Thank you. I'll be fine.

12:32.996 --> 12:35.521
Please tell my friends
I'll rejoin them in a minute.

12:35.599 --> 12:36.964
As you wish.

12:42.639 --> 12:45.107
Sit here, if you like.

12:45.175 --> 12:46.802
Please.

12:52.114 --> 12:57.177
I never dreamed
that there was anyone...

12:57.253 --> 13:00.086
anyone on this Earth like you,

13:00.156 --> 13:04.718
and if there was,
I should ever look upon her.

13:05.695 --> 13:07.595
And now I am.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.291
Allah is being too kind.

13:10.366 --> 13:12.834
No, it is you that is too kind.

13:12.902 --> 13:15.132
What did that man say?

13:15.705 --> 13:18.503
You've come to meet me?

13:19.208 --> 13:20.232
Yes.

13:21.577 --> 13:24.444
Why? May I know why?

13:25.181 --> 13:27.046
Well, it's a long story.

13:27.116 --> 13:31.177
Does it have a short answer?

13:32.421 --> 13:33.581
Yes, it does.

13:33.656 --> 13:36.591
Is it possible that I may hear it?

13:38.894 --> 13:41.590
Well, it's going to sound
so stupid now.

13:41.664 --> 13:43.130
I have come all this way

13:43.198 --> 13:46.497
to give you something
you may not even want.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.698
My virginity.

13:57.445 --> 14:01.313
I've never been given this gift before.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.680
Is it true?

14:04.586 --> 14:06.349
Will you take the gift?

14:09.424 --> 14:11.289
This very night.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.821
You will come with me to my palace,

14:15.897 --> 14:20.129
and I will take your gift
with great happiness.

14:20.201 --> 14:24.535
I had dreamed of a beautiful tent
and desert.

14:25.240 --> 14:29.176
I can give you the whole golden Sahara
and a thousand tents.

14:30.178 --> 14:31.645
We leave tonight.

14:31.713 --> 14:32.974
It's not too far?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.113
I have an aeroplane.

14:35.182 --> 14:36.672
You have an aeroplane?

14:39.019 --> 14:40.850
How else could I fly you?

14:41.688 --> 14:42.712
Of course.

14:43.590 --> 14:45.717
Is it possible we could go tomorrow?

14:48.529 --> 14:51.521
I'll be carrying the same gift with me?

14:52.366 --> 14:54.334
Only a day older.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.065
- Do you think I'm mad, Cotton?
- No, not mad.

14:59.139 --> 15:00.800
Or maybe bad?

15:00.874 --> 15:02.967
- The truth?
- Can I take it?

15:03.043 --> 15:05.773
- I envy your spirit.
- Thank you.

15:05.846 --> 15:08.212
- Now, this is a parachute.
- Okay.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.807
- I'm gonna buckle it right here.
- All right.

15:10.884 --> 15:12.749
- I don't want you to use it.
- No.

15:12.820 --> 15:15.584
But if you have to,
you pull this little ring right there.

15:15.656 --> 15:17.521
Okay, okay.

15:17.591 --> 15:19.855
I'll save the biggest piece
of the cake for you.

15:21.328 --> 15:22.555
That's because I love you

15:22.628 --> 15:25.358
and because this airplane
scares me too much.

15:25.431 --> 15:27.661
I'd rather you were going on a camel.

15:28.901 --> 15:31.426
This is a magnificent aircraft.

15:32.338 --> 15:35.535
It is at least five years ahead
of its time.

15:36.342 --> 15:38.742
An experimental design.

15:39.712 --> 15:41.236
It's magnificent!

15:51.257 --> 15:52.519
Everything's all right.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.288
Hold on tight!

16:22.254 --> 16:24.188
The sun's completely gone.

16:25.957 --> 16:28.050
Her fat's in the fire now.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.284
I don't know about that.

16:30.362 --> 16:33.661
I don't think she'd have any trouble
handling that boy.

16:39.871 --> 16:41.338
May I have the pleasure?

16:44.743 --> 16:47.405
No, thank you.
I don't want to leave my husband alone.

16:47.479 --> 16:49.003
But thank you for asking.

16:51.082 --> 16:53.107
Dance with the gentleman.

16:53.185 --> 16:54.584
You don't mind?

16:54.653 --> 16:58.612
You know how much I like
to see my wife have a good time.

17:08.732 --> 17:09.756
Go on. Hurry!

17:10.099 --> 17:11.089
Tell me!

17:11.167 --> 17:12.896
Cat! All right!

17:12.970 --> 17:17.167
Well, we flew
over a billion miles of sand.

17:54.677 --> 17:56.736
Remember, Cat,
how in the moving pictures

17:56.813 --> 18:00.044
Valentino rode down the sand dunes
and swept the heroine off her feet?

18:00.116 --> 18:01.105
Yeah.

18:01.184 --> 18:03.118
I asked my sheik
to do that to me.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.053
Cat, you should've seen him.
It was so sad.

18:07.123 --> 18:10.490
Every time he would try to be Valentino
and sweep me off my feet,

18:10.560 --> 18:12.858
his horse would go the other way.

18:12.929 --> 18:15.159
What happened?

18:16.399 --> 18:19.368
- What's the matter?
- I hate horses.

18:19.435 --> 18:22.063
But you can't hate horses.
You're a sheik!

18:23.640 --> 18:25.301
I know I'm a sheik.

18:26.376 --> 18:29.140
I had an English nanny.

18:29.212 --> 18:31.180
He had an English nanny?

18:31.247 --> 18:32.839
The nanny was all right.

18:32.915 --> 18:35.145
I go to school at Oxford.

18:35.218 --> 18:38.051
I've been here three times
my whole life.

18:39.656 --> 18:41.089
I'm a poet.

18:42.391 --> 18:44.382
Well, you're still a sheik.

18:44.459 --> 18:49.226
The rest of my life is going to have
a very, very hard time keeping up with this.

18:50.565 --> 18:53.796
Do you realize that no man on this earth

18:53.869 --> 18:58.602
will ever again know the joy that you...

18:58.674 --> 19:02.269
you will bring to me this night.

19:03.845 --> 19:06.871
You are like the most precious flower.

19:07.582 --> 19:10.983
And your blooming
can only be enjoyed once.

19:12.554 --> 19:13.612
Just once.

19:13.689 --> 19:14.951
His tent was a dream.

19:15.023 --> 19:20.825
It was gigantic, filled with servants
and dancing girls.

19:20.896 --> 19:22.227
And belly dancers.

19:22.297 --> 19:25.562
They do incredible things
with their stomachs, Cat.

19:25.634 --> 19:27.659
What? What do they do?

20:10.444 --> 20:12.207
Fantastic!

20:12.279 --> 20:13.871
What happened then?

20:13.948 --> 20:16.917
Well, then he kissed me.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.076
Why?

20:18.152 --> 20:21.951
Cat, he lay me down so gently,
but positively.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.989
I would have died.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.761
And then...

20:36.403 --> 20:37.700
...he undressed me.

20:37.771 --> 20:38.795
What?

20:38.872 --> 20:40.169
Everything?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.606
I mean, everything?

20:42.675 --> 20:43.937
Everything.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.275
- Was everyone still there?
- No, no, no.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.144
- No?
- He had them sent away.

22:17.001 --> 22:20.937
Every time he went for the honey,

22:21.005 --> 22:26.602
my stomach would sort of rise
to meet his lips.

22:41.425 --> 22:43.359
Why would your stomach rise?

22:43.427 --> 22:45.327
I guess it was inviting him.

22:45.396 --> 22:46.658
To where, Mac?
To where?

22:46.731 --> 22:49.529
- Catalina!
- Oh, there, of course.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.726
Of course.

23:00.644 --> 23:01.872
What?

23:04.681 --> 23:07.309
- What?
- I've been lying.

23:07.384 --> 23:08.715
Lying?!

23:10.186 --> 23:11.244
Well...

23:12.656 --> 23:15.819
I don't know, when we were, well...

23:17.861 --> 23:19.726
When it should've happened...

23:41.584 --> 23:42.812
No, Mac!

23:42.885 --> 23:44.352
He went to sleep?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.478
It's all right.

23:46.555 --> 23:50.992
My ego tells me the sleep was
from the magic smoke, not me.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.153
Oh, Rudy, Rudy.

23:54.063 --> 23:56.531
Why are they all counterfeits?

23:57.366 --> 23:58.697
Look at me.

24:00.102 --> 24:02.400
I'm all dressed up
with no place to go.

24:07.543 --> 24:09.374
Now, what do we do?

24:10.479 --> 24:12.709
Well, we try again.

24:12.781 --> 24:15.545
Mac, this place scares me.

24:16.251 --> 24:20.711
Really, couldn't we go someplace
like Switzerland or Sweden?

24:20.789 --> 24:22.586
Maybe Holland!
It's a nice place.

24:22.658 --> 24:24.250
Holland? Cat!

24:24.326 --> 24:28.422
It has to be warm and sultry and dark-eyed
when you give your virginity away.

24:28.497 --> 24:30.260
Like Italy or Spain.

24:31.432 --> 24:33.059
Italians scare me too much.

24:33.134 --> 24:37.127
And Mac, I can't give my virginity
away in Spain.

24:37.205 --> 24:39.435
I am eh-Spanish!

24:39.507 --> 24:41.407
I know you are "eh-Spanish."

24:41.476 --> 24:43.569
And you can't go to Barcelona.

24:44.445 --> 24:47.243
So we won't even go near Barcelona.

24:53.488 --> 24:54.546
Hey, toro!

24:54.622 --> 24:55.919
¡Toro!

24:58.893 --> 25:00.383
Hey, toro!

25:43.870 --> 25:45.235
Matador!

25:45.305 --> 25:46.602
You're a matador?

25:46.673 --> 25:48.698
Too many seasons ago.

25:50.377 --> 25:53.505
- It must've been magnificent.
- I had some afternoons.

26:24.043 --> 26:25.476
Oh, my God!
What's he doing?

26:25.544 --> 26:26.875
The horse could be killed!

26:26.946 --> 26:28.504
This is a kind of festival.

26:28.581 --> 26:31.015
You see the bull's horns?
They're capped.

26:31.083 --> 26:34.143
But even in the big bull ring,
you never kill bulls.

26:34.220 --> 26:38.623
Did you go Vigo? Used to fight
without the blood... nothing.

26:38.691 --> 26:41.159
He is not so popular with the people.

26:41.227 --> 26:43.161
I like a little bit of the blood.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.789
Cotton, did you understand
what he said?

26:45.865 --> 26:48.595
Yeah. He never the bull kills,
he never the blood sheds.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.692
Therefore, he's not very popular
with the people.

26:50.770 --> 26:51.998
Frankly, I think I'm going to enjoy it.

26:52.071 --> 26:53.163
Look at that!

26:53.239 --> 26:56.504
Cotton, does all this
make the ends of your boots curl up?

26:56.575 --> 26:58.236
Tight as a drum!

27:00.312 --> 27:01.471
¡Toro!

27:12.490 --> 27:14.014
Hey, toro!

27:35.346 --> 27:36.677
¡Toro!

28:08.812 --> 28:10.746
¡Toro, toro!

28:44.814 --> 28:46.008
Who's that?

28:46.148 --> 28:48.412
She is his gypsy shadow.

28:48.484 --> 28:52.284
- Cotton, did you...
- She's his gypsy shadow.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.556
What's wrong?

29:29.625 --> 29:32.058
I'm going to go see the duke
who is half-man half-horse.

29:32.127 --> 29:33.856
- Where do I find him?
- In the chapel.

29:33.929 --> 29:34.918
Okay.

29:34.996 --> 29:36.896
See you later, everybody.

29:58.053 --> 29:59.987
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

30:05.226 --> 30:09.356
I just wanted to say
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

30:10.432 --> 30:11.456
Nor have I.

30:14.703 --> 30:18.639
Do you think it's possible...
could I see your horses?

30:19.474 --> 30:20.873
With pleasure.

30:30.851 --> 30:31.977
You know horses.

30:32.686 --> 30:35.450
I love them.
I was raised with them at school.

30:36.190 --> 30:38.385
But ours were never like these.

30:38.459 --> 30:41.587
Ours would run and jump
and chase a ball around the field,

30:41.662 --> 30:43.357
but yours are magical.

30:43.430 --> 30:44.727
They're like Pegasus.

30:44.798 --> 30:46.356
Aren't you like Pegasus?

30:46.433 --> 30:49.994
I would consider it an honor
if you would join me at dinner tonight.

30:53.807 --> 30:55.331
Thank you.

30:55.409 --> 30:57.070
But I have two friends.

30:58.645 --> 30:59.976
Bring them.

31:01.582 --> 31:02.606
Thank you.

31:06.620 --> 31:09.214
You didn't have to invite them tonight.

31:09.289 --> 31:12.314
These are private moments
for the family only.

31:12.825 --> 31:16.818
It's bad enough that that gypsy child
is always with you.

31:16.896 --> 31:19.387
We never have any time alone.

31:19.465 --> 31:21.626
With you living in the country.

31:22.502 --> 31:24.561
You never come to the city.

31:24.637 --> 31:26.605
You hardly put a bite of food
in your mouth.

31:26.672 --> 31:28.663
I didn't come here to eat.

31:28.741 --> 31:29.935
That's too bad.

31:30.009 --> 31:31.670
That was very fine chow.

31:36.049 --> 31:38.745
He hasn't spoken to us all night.

31:38.818 --> 31:41.048
Hardly even a look.

32:00.973 --> 32:04.874
Did you enjoy the fight, Cotton?

32:06.845 --> 32:08.779
He's sending you messages?

32:08.847 --> 32:10.542
You noticed.

32:19.124 --> 32:21.422
That's a pretty big message.

32:22.561 --> 32:23.858
It feels like it.

32:31.670 --> 32:33.399
It's nice, huh, Cat?

32:35.474 --> 32:37.169
If that's what you want.

32:37.242 --> 32:39.039
Come on, Cat.

32:39.111 --> 32:40.806
Have some fun!

32:40.879 --> 32:42.437
Send someone a message.

32:44.883 --> 32:46.009
Who else is there?

32:47.252 --> 32:48.241
Him.

32:51.322 --> 32:53.950
Angel, Angel!
She looked at me.

32:57.761 --> 32:59.626
Just practice on him.

32:59.697 --> 33:01.688
Yeah! You're bad!

33:04.568 --> 33:07.128
I could be if someone would
just give me the chance.

33:07.204 --> 33:10.037
She knows a real man
when she sees one.

33:11.008 --> 33:12.236
Now it's your table.

33:12.309 --> 33:13.901
Take care of the women.

33:14.945 --> 33:16.708
See Mama home.

33:16.780 --> 33:18.839
You must come to see me more often.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.111
I will, Mama.

33:46.943 --> 33:47.967
Good night.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.559
Mama.

34:13.803 --> 34:16.237
Where is he go...
Where is he going?

34:16.306 --> 34:18.137
I know where he goes.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.641
I know you know.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.268
That's why I'm asking.
Where?

34:22.344 --> 34:24.472
Why you care where he goes?

34:24.547 --> 34:26.481
I want to see him.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.715
I don't think he wants.

34:31.753 --> 34:32.879
What's your name?

34:33.922 --> 34:34.980
Paloma.

34:35.690 --> 34:39.252
Well, Paloma, do you think
we can do business with this?

34:41.597 --> 34:43.292
The mirror is for me?

34:43.364 --> 34:45.697
It is if you take me to him.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.324
Do you accept?

34:48.737 --> 34:50.101
It's too much.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.969
For you, it's nothing.

34:52.708 --> 34:56.542
No. For me, it is very beautiful
and very valuable.

34:57.779 --> 34:59.144
For me, too.

34:59.214 --> 35:01.478
- Good. Then it's done?
- Sure.

35:01.550 --> 35:02.676
Okay.

35:02.751 --> 35:05.345
Now, are we going to be welcome?

35:05.420 --> 35:07.445
You are not welcome.

35:07.522 --> 35:11.618
Because for a gypsy,
no stranger is welcome.

35:12.794 --> 35:17.458
But you are with me,
so we'll be all right.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.760
Okay.

35:18.834 --> 35:19.823
Sorry.

35:19.901 --> 35:21.834
I think.

35:41.022 --> 35:43.217
I have the rich lady.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.518
I have the rich lady.

35:45.593 --> 35:47.686
Why do you bring her here?

35:47.762 --> 35:49.730
She gave me this.

35:49.797 --> 35:52.027
- What lady?
- The blond lady.

35:52.099 --> 35:58.629
Angel and Raymond say she is
the most beautiful woman in all the world.

36:15.789 --> 36:17.757
You want to go to the bed
with my man?

36:18.992 --> 36:21.722
I don't think any of us wanna go
to bed with your man.

36:21.795 --> 36:23.228
It's true?

36:24.998 --> 36:26.659
Do I look so dishonest?

36:27.667 --> 36:28.827
It's true?

36:30.003 --> 36:32.062
I think your man is very beautiful.

36:32.605 --> 36:34.004
You see good.

36:34.074 --> 36:36.474
And do you want to take him
to your bed?

36:36.543 --> 36:39.239
- I think...
- I think no.

36:39.312 --> 36:41.246
I'm the woman for his bed

36:41.314 --> 36:43.145
and there will be no other.

36:43.683 --> 36:45.480
No other.

36:49.356 --> 36:51.119
She is too mean.

36:51.191 --> 36:53.955
Hey, how long has he been with her?

36:54.561 --> 36:56.654
Since her 14 years birthday.

36:57.664 --> 36:59.029
It's me next.

36:59.532 --> 37:03.126
Soon, he's going to take me.

37:04.203 --> 37:05.602
He'll do what?

37:06.538 --> 37:07.971
Take me.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.837
I'll be his woman.

37:10.976 --> 37:12.341
You'll be his what?

37:19.318 --> 37:21.980
Woman.

37:23.455 --> 37:24.945
Oh, damn.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.286
Well, it looks like you're all out of luck.

37:28.360 --> 37:31.386
The little firebrand is
taking her man to bed.

37:33.999 --> 37:38.163
You know something?
I think it's time we all went beddy-bye.

37:38.871 --> 37:40.668
Why he do that?

37:41.407 --> 37:43.967
He do not even like her anymore.

37:45.944 --> 37:47.411
Thank you, Paloma.

37:48.247 --> 37:51.044
It's been a very interesting experience.

37:51.115 --> 37:53.310
I hope your 14th birthday comes soon.

37:53.384 --> 37:55.875
You do not want me to go
to the town with you?

37:55.953 --> 37:59.218
Like Cotton said,
we are all going to bed.

38:01.426 --> 38:03.121
And where are you gonna sleep?

38:03.194 --> 38:06.129
Wherever they sleep,
I sleep on the floor.

38:06.197 --> 38:07.459
You've got a deal.

38:07.532 --> 38:09.124
Paloma! Let's get out of the tub.

38:10.268 --> 38:14.534
No! I go stay in here forever!

38:15.306 --> 38:18.070
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

38:19.210 --> 38:21.007
What a mess!

38:22.313 --> 38:23.575
Look at you.

38:23.648 --> 38:25.673
What are we going to do today?

38:25.750 --> 38:28.344
- Am I going to help you?
- Absolutely.

38:28.419 --> 38:29.511
Here we go. Up.

38:29.587 --> 38:30.918
No!

38:30.988 --> 38:32.046
Stand up.

38:32.123 --> 38:35.854
- What you going to do?
- I'm going to rinse you off.

38:35.927 --> 38:37.952
- But why?
- So you don't itch.

38:38.029 --> 38:40.463
- But...
- Look at you.

38:40.531 --> 38:43.499
I am woman ready.

38:43.567 --> 38:45.228
Juicy, too.

38:49.506 --> 38:53.340
We are not up here
freezing our tiny titties off

38:53.410 --> 38:56.379
because you just want
to buy a horse today!

38:56.446 --> 38:57.640
We're not?

38:57.714 --> 39:00.774
No, Miss McGillvary,
we are not!

39:00.851 --> 39:06.312
You want this beautiful young duke
to quickly take your sweet virginity.

39:06.389 --> 39:11.326
That's why we're freezing up here
in a dumb car that won't run!

39:11.394 --> 39:14.488
I might kill two birds with one stone.

39:15.332 --> 39:18.267
Don't you have to be
in love with him to do that?

39:18.335 --> 39:20.735
I don't know.
I've never done it before.

39:27.978 --> 39:29.377
Oh, my God.

39:37.086 --> 39:40.578
All right. Very slowly,
everybody back to the car.

39:41.090 --> 39:42.148
Okay.

39:42.224 --> 39:44.124
He could break this car.

39:44.293 --> 39:48.457
I'll... hit him between the eyes.

39:48.531 --> 39:51.659
Cotton, that's a bull.

39:51.834 --> 39:52.994
It's not a bull.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.147
What are you doing way up here?

40:13.222 --> 40:15.747
Paloma said you may be
in the mountains for a whole week.

40:15.824 --> 40:16.813
I couldn't wait.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.087
And you came all this way to see me?

40:19.161 --> 40:22.596
She said some of your bulls had
run up into the mountains after cows,

40:22.664 --> 40:24.962
and you had to get them
before they froze.

40:25.033 --> 40:26.864
Was that one of the naughty boys?

40:29.404 --> 40:30.496
He was.

40:31.039 --> 40:32.529
Why did you want to see me?

40:32.607 --> 40:34.768
I want to buy some of your horses.

40:34.842 --> 40:36.833
I don't sell horses.

40:39.514 --> 40:41.277
Not even young ones?

40:41.349 --> 40:43.647
I sell wine and bulls.

40:44.218 --> 40:46.049
I don't sell horses.
I'm sorry.

40:46.721 --> 40:48.154
That seems so final.

40:48.222 --> 40:49.348
I'm sorry.

40:49.424 --> 40:51.255
I feel so badly.

40:52.594 --> 40:55.529
I would like to offer you
the hospitality of my home,

40:55.597 --> 40:58.191
but it's so far away
from this mountaintop.

40:58.266 --> 41:02.134
Well, if you found
all of your wayward bulls,

41:02.203 --> 41:04.865
maybe you could
ride back in the car with us.

41:04.939 --> 41:06.998
That would be very nice of you.

41:08.009 --> 41:09.271
It's our pleasure.

41:12.846 --> 41:15.781
Rafael. Rafael.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.647
What possible use can you have
for one of these horses?

41:19.353 --> 41:22.117
Assuming you owned
one of my horses right now,

41:22.189 --> 41:23.679
what would you do with it?

41:23.757 --> 41:26.521
If I owned
one of your horses right now,

41:26.593 --> 41:29.153
I'd tell him, "I am not your owner."

41:30.464 --> 41:32.056
"I am your friend."

41:38.505 --> 41:40.166
Gracias, Rafael.

41:44.444 --> 41:47.242
These horses are nothing
without the bulls.

41:47.314 --> 41:49.714
Can you really see yourself doing this?

41:49.783 --> 41:51.216
Oh, I can.

41:51.284 --> 41:53.878
But then some people think I'm crazy.

41:55.489 --> 41:58.720
You're sure there's no amount of money
that can buy that horse?

41:58.792 --> 42:00.350
No amount.

42:01.861 --> 42:04.728
But isn't it said
that everything has its price?

42:04.797 --> 42:07.630
My wine does, my horses don't.

42:08.768 --> 42:11.430
Mac, that's a beautiful horse.

42:11.504 --> 42:13.563
I know.
I want him.

42:13.639 --> 42:15.106
Sure you do.

42:19.645 --> 42:22.978
May I invite you to dinner tonight
and try and change your mind?

42:23.049 --> 42:24.778
I would enjoy such a dinner,

42:24.850 --> 42:28.445
but unfortunately,
I have plans that I cannot cancel.

42:29.355 --> 42:30.754
What a shame.

42:30.823 --> 42:32.620
You're sure?

42:32.692 --> 42:34.683
Sadly, it's true.

42:35.628 --> 42:38.722
What if I were to not talk
about horses, but wine?

42:40.032 --> 42:41.795
Even more sadly.

42:43.436 --> 42:45.063
I surrender.

42:45.137 --> 42:47.037
I've run out of what-ifs.

42:48.974 --> 42:51.339
Well, if we ever get back to the hotel,

42:51.409 --> 42:54.708
it looks like dinner
with the old gang tonight.

42:55.280 --> 42:59.512
Cotton, I think I'm just going to
go to bed and lick my wounds.

42:59.584 --> 43:01.415
McGillvary, you just lost the battle.

43:01.486 --> 43:03.249
You didn't lose the war.

43:05.690 --> 43:09.251
Do you think Cotton believed
your little-wounded-lady story?

43:09.794 --> 43:11.284
I think so.

43:11.362 --> 43:13.421
It was partly true.

43:13.631 --> 43:15.758
Why I can't come with you?

43:16.801 --> 43:20.237
Because an opium den
is not a place for little girls.

43:20.305 --> 43:25.504
You can stay there and bath...
I mean, and swim in the tub.

43:25.577 --> 43:27.943
I'm no little girl.

43:29.080 --> 43:32.106
Mac, do you know
anything about opium?

43:32.650 --> 43:34.083
Next to nothing.

43:34.152 --> 43:36.916
Except that it sounds romantic.

43:36.988 --> 43:41.617
Well, the textbook say
that opium has two faces.

43:41.692 --> 43:44.252
First face, killer... in large amounts.

43:44.328 --> 43:48.856
Second face, love potion...
in small amounts.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.835
Well, then it seems
as long as we're going to use it,

43:52.903 --> 43:56.703
it should be exclusively
in the romantic amounts.

44:03.480 --> 44:06.244
Are you sure Angel's going to be
in this place tonight?

44:06.917 --> 44:08.145
Sure he going to be.

44:08.218 --> 44:11.585
If he not at Lady Woo-hoo's tonight,

44:11.655 --> 44:18.959
I give you back... mirror and pearl.

44:19.296 --> 44:20.593
Please?

44:20.664 --> 44:22.097
All right.

44:22.166 --> 44:25.033
I make exceptions
for you and your friend.

44:25.102 --> 44:26.899
Thank you very much.

44:26.970 --> 44:28.904
Do you know the poppy well?

44:28.972 --> 44:30.871
Well, we're acquainted.

44:30.940 --> 44:32.464
May I offer to guide you?

44:32.542 --> 44:34.305
If you would be so kind.

44:36.779 --> 44:40.613
A love potion,
in small amounts.

44:41.651 --> 44:43.778
Are we really going to do this?

44:43.853 --> 44:45.013
I am.

44:45.822 --> 44:48.188
Well, I hope we have a good time.

44:48.257 --> 44:51.124
Oh, shit. I can't.

45:05.208 --> 45:06.436
It's so hot.

45:12.148 --> 45:17.381
Can you feel yourself
going or gone?

45:17.453 --> 45:19.751
Definitely.

45:20.922 --> 45:22.253
Can you?

45:24.392 --> 45:29.853
It's nice... feeling.

45:32.267 --> 45:34.030
Nice?

45:35.503 --> 45:38.836
Cat, it's more than nice.

45:38.907 --> 45:40.636
I know.

45:47.782 --> 45:53.311
The lady said, "Move slowly."

45:54.823 --> 45:57.155
"Always slowly."

45:59.227 --> 46:01.923
I think it's time we go find Angel.

46:31.992 --> 46:33.687
Is something wrong?

46:34.862 --> 46:36.227
No.

46:39.566 --> 46:42.433
We were expecting Angel Sacristan.

46:42.503 --> 46:44.266
I see.

46:44.338 --> 46:46.067
If you wait a minute, please.

46:46.140 --> 46:47.573
Of course.

46:48.375 --> 46:49.569
We'll wait.

47:01.788 --> 47:04.279
It looks as though
our little gypsy was right.

47:06.526 --> 47:08.721
It seems he is here.

47:10.797 --> 47:15.427
If he is, what are you going to do?

47:16.169 --> 47:18.763
Lie down and say hi?

47:18.838 --> 47:20.465
Hi.

47:21.941 --> 47:25.069
I don't sell horses.

47:27.613 --> 47:30.207
Only wine and bulls.

47:30.283 --> 47:36.654
How many bottles of wine
would you said you had?

47:36.723 --> 47:39.191
Maybe a million.

47:40.994 --> 47:46.557
What? Nobody has
a million bottles of wine.

47:47.133 --> 47:53.162
I wonder how long would take us
to count to a million bottles of wine.

47:53.505 --> 47:56.963
About 100 rows, about 300 bottles.

47:57.042 --> 48:01.911
I mean... We got...
I mean, there is no way.

48:03.215 --> 48:04.739
Twenty...

48:04.816 --> 48:06.681
Was I right?

48:07.619 --> 48:09.678
One million? Two million?

48:09.755 --> 48:11.188
Five million?

48:12.824 --> 48:16.988
Angel, how much would it take
to buy everything you produce?

48:17.529 --> 48:19.656
- Everything that I produce?
- Yes.

48:19.731 --> 48:20.959
Do you know about wine?

48:21.033 --> 48:23.297
Catalina's family has vineyards.

48:23.368 --> 48:26.064
Nothing compared to this.

48:26.138 --> 48:28.732
Look, Angel,
can you excuse us a minute?

48:28.807 --> 48:29.899
Of course.

48:34.046 --> 48:35.877
Mac, buy it.
You have too much money!

48:35.947 --> 48:37.005
Buy it!

48:37.082 --> 48:38.071
And I'll run it.

48:38.150 --> 48:40.447
You know if I was a boy,
I was supposed to run ours.

48:40.518 --> 48:41.883
Please do it,
and we'll divide up the profits, okay?

48:41.952 --> 48:42.941
Okay!

48:43.020 --> 48:47.354
I will accept whatever two
out of three local banks value my wine at.

48:47.425 --> 48:48.722
Is that fair?

48:49.927 --> 48:51.121
Fantastic!

48:51.195 --> 48:52.992
But you must hurry
and close the deal with the bank

48:53.064 --> 48:56.124
because they hold
the paper on the wine.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.498
They are trying hard
to sell their position.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.799
Okay. Cotton and I
will leave immediately, okay?

49:00.871 --> 49:03.237
Listen, call the bank
and tell them we are coming, okay?

49:03.307 --> 49:05.468
Fantastic! Bye!

49:05.543 --> 49:06.567
Fantastic!

49:09.280 --> 49:11.771
Fantastic! God!

49:12.917 --> 49:13.906
Well...

49:18.889 --> 49:21.517
Now that that's behind us...

49:23.194 --> 49:26.095
...why don't we talk
about that honey-colored horse?

49:27.798 --> 49:31.358
I'm sorry, but I really don't sell horses.

49:32.535 --> 49:35.732
Maybe the word "sell" is
where we're having our problem.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.164
Maybe.

50:40.903 --> 50:42.598
It was wonderful!

50:43.305 --> 50:45.330
- Did you freeze?
- Didn't you?

50:45.407 --> 50:47.602
I was warm as toast.

50:47.676 --> 50:49.906
I think I'm intoxicated by your horse.

50:49.978 --> 50:51.070
Your horse.

50:51.146 --> 50:53.376
Of course. My horse.

50:53.448 --> 50:56.679
I never dreamed there was
such a beautiful horse.

50:56.752 --> 50:58.083
What am I smelling?

50:59.288 --> 51:00.312
Hot cinnamon wine.

51:00.389 --> 51:01.754
Oh, I'd love some.

51:01.823 --> 51:05.054
Didn't I smell something chocolaty...

51:06.195 --> 51:08.254
They say you gave her
the golden horse!

51:08.330 --> 51:09.661
Hardly...

51:09.731 --> 51:11.129
I do not speak to you.

51:11.199 --> 51:12.791
Natty, Miss McGillvary is my guest.

51:12.867 --> 51:14.801
- Your guest.
- Good night, Natty!

51:14.869 --> 51:16.166
You bitch!

51:16.237 --> 51:17.465
- All right, that's enough.
- Bitch!

51:17.538 --> 51:18.698
You American bitch!

51:18.773 --> 51:20.604
You bitch!

51:29.150 --> 51:31.880
Now I kill you.
I have to kill you.

51:31.953 --> 51:33.921
No more, Natty!
No more!

51:35.356 --> 51:36.948
You are going back to camp.

51:38.059 --> 51:39.185
Love me tonight.

51:39.260 --> 51:41.023
Stop it.

51:41.095 --> 51:43.154
Please, stop it, Natty.

51:44.398 --> 51:46.263
Now I kill you.
I have to kill you!

51:46.334 --> 51:47.528
Natty, shut up!

51:47.602 --> 51:48.660
You shut up!

51:51.105 --> 51:52.834
I kill you for sure.

51:52.907 --> 51:54.772
Then go get your knife.

52:04.851 --> 52:07.752
Please, Natty, go home.

52:20.300 --> 52:21.961
Hello.

52:24.004 --> 52:25.835
I apologize.

52:27.974 --> 52:30.374
I think I've known her too long.

52:30.443 --> 52:34.402
You've known her, I believe,
since her 14th birthday?

52:37.651 --> 52:40.176
The gypsy world is very different.

52:42.088 --> 52:44.454
Fourteen years is very different.

52:46.626 --> 52:48.150
Does this interest you?

52:52.364 --> 52:54.298
I'd be lying if I said it didn't.

52:55.801 --> 52:59.897
Fine. Why don't we go
to a more comfortable room...

53:00.706 --> 53:02.435
...enjoy some chocolate cake,

53:02.508 --> 53:04.601
and we can investigate the difference.

53:04.677 --> 53:07.168
And then, as I told you,
he fell asleep.

53:07.713 --> 53:11.171
So now you have the story
of my sheik.

53:11.984 --> 53:14.976
Maybe you should have
come to Spain first.

53:18.724 --> 53:20.282
Maybe I should have.

53:23.529 --> 53:27.295
And now would you consider
giving this burden to me?

53:31.670 --> 53:33.729
Would you be interested in taking it?

53:41.112 --> 53:42.477
Please.

53:46.784 --> 53:48.081
Rest.

53:48.953 --> 53:52.286
And I'll join you here at sunrise.

54:04.736 --> 54:06.363
Sunrise?

54:10.541 --> 54:12.736
Now seems just perfect.

54:14.412 --> 54:16.880
Fruit's about to fall from the tree.

54:19.183 --> 54:22.050
That was beautiful.
Thank you.

54:22.754 --> 54:24.779
I'll rest in here tonight.

54:24.856 --> 54:28.917
Be sure to wake me exactly...
and I mean exactly...

54:28.993 --> 54:30.983
half hour before the sun rises.

54:31.061 --> 54:33.962
Well, tonight you make baby.

54:40.003 --> 54:44.099
He's either very clever or very cruel...

54:45.442 --> 54:47.808
...because I'm going mad with wonder.

54:51.415 --> 54:53.042
It's time.

54:55.585 --> 54:57.644
Oye, you awake?

55:08.632 --> 55:10.566
What... what are you doing?

55:10.634 --> 55:13.228
I thought you should be
as scared to death as I am.

55:19.376 --> 55:21.138
You are a ghost who is afraid?

55:21.210 --> 55:23.872
That's about to wet its pants.

55:26.282 --> 55:29.376
I was so secure
when I came in here last night.

55:30.286 --> 55:32.379
But then, I was also as high as a kite.

55:34.390 --> 55:35.550
What are you doing?

55:36.826 --> 55:38.987
Angel, what are you doing?

55:39.895 --> 55:41.260
Have you gone?

55:43.299 --> 55:44.527
Are you still here?

55:45.534 --> 55:47.297
Angel, are you still here?

55:49.238 --> 55:50.500
I knew it!

55:50.573 --> 55:52.268
I knew this sheet was a dumb idea.

55:52.341 --> 55:53.933
I shouldn't have done...

55:55.744 --> 55:56.768
Oh, my God!

55:58.180 --> 56:00.444
You're as naked
as the day you were born.

56:00.516 --> 56:02.347
That's true.

56:02.418 --> 56:07.219
But only because it's been found to be
the most practical way to make love.

56:07.957 --> 56:09.424
You're gonna kiss me?

56:11.392 --> 56:12.984
I thought I was.

56:16.431 --> 56:18.262
May I kiss you instead?

56:18.333 --> 56:20.267
Whatever you like.

56:20.335 --> 56:21.666
Okay.

56:23.004 --> 56:26.064
- Where would you like us to be?
- Oh, I don't know.

56:29.277 --> 56:32.144
The bed!
The bed would be nice!

56:35.550 --> 56:37.677
Is there anything I can do to help?

56:38.586 --> 56:39.883
I don't know!

56:41.956 --> 56:43.014
Yes.

56:43.725 --> 56:44.953
Lie down, please?

56:45.994 --> 56:47.154
Could you lie down, please?

56:47.228 --> 56:49.253
I think that would make it even better.

56:53.468 --> 56:56.403
I've always imagined
this would be a fabulous kiss.

56:56.471 --> 56:58.234
Put your head down, please.

57:01.008 --> 57:02.805
And now close your eyes.

57:02.876 --> 57:04.605
And keep them closed.

57:06.213 --> 57:09.705
And remember, this is my kiss.
You do nothing.

57:32.739 --> 57:35.071
Was my imagination lousy?

57:35.142 --> 57:38.942
- Was it a blah kiss?
- It was a great kiss.

57:39.012 --> 57:41.276
I'm sorry.
It was a blah kiss.

57:41.348 --> 57:42.975
It was a fabulous kiss.

57:43.050 --> 57:44.779
No. I'm sorry.

57:48.322 --> 57:51.518
Angel... now...

57:52.191 --> 57:53.681
right now...

57:57.697 --> 57:59.892
will you show me everything?

58:03.936 --> 58:05.631
Do everything to me?

58:09.275 --> 58:11.505
Show me everything I can do to you?

58:19.518 --> 58:21.110
Am I too greedy?

58:28.594 --> 58:30.323
You must be greedy.

58:30.396 --> 58:32.830
The bed is a selfish place.

58:33.599 --> 58:37.035
In it, we seem to give
only so that we may receive.

58:39.105 --> 58:41.629
Is there enough that I can give to you?

58:42.307 --> 58:45.276
So that you can give ecstasy to me.

58:50.448 --> 58:52.746
That we will have to look for together.

58:59.858 --> 59:01.519
Do you mind, Marie?

59:07.599 --> 59:11.330
Marie, do you mind?
Please?

59:13.371 --> 59:14.531
Gracias.

59:29.054 --> 59:30.179
Open.

01:00:06.657 --> 01:00:08.056
No, please.

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:10.756
I'm sorry.

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:14.395
I'm not a virgin anymore.

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:25.006
Hola. ¿Hola?

01:03:26.586 --> 01:03:29.282
Sí. Dígame.

01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:30.549
Sí, un momento.

01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:36.186
The telephone!
He want you!

01:03:47.472 --> 01:03:49.030
Hola.
Catalina, ¿qué tal?

01:03:49.107 --> 01:03:50.267
Hello.

01:03:51.143 --> 01:03:52.303
Hello.

01:03:53.111 --> 01:03:54.100
Gracias.

01:03:54.179 --> 01:03:55.441
Do you like it?

01:03:55.514 --> 01:03:58.915
I think he's the most beautiful thing
in the entire world.

01:03:59.518 --> 01:04:03.010
I have to go to the bank, sign papers.

01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:07.819
I'll go with you.

01:04:08.794 --> 01:04:10.318
You will not.

01:04:12.197 --> 01:04:18.033
You will enjoy your horse
and when I return tonight...

01:04:19.104 --> 01:04:21.334
...we will celebrate your horse

01:04:21.406 --> 01:04:26.139
and the entering
the wine business and...

01:04:30.548 --> 01:04:34.348
I see here that you are holding
several valuable items.

01:04:37.588 --> 01:04:42.389
A 1924 Rolls motorcar
and some art.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.190
Why don't we
take care of these as well?

01:05:14.058 --> 01:05:16.026
There you are, gentlemen.

01:05:18.129 --> 01:05:19.221
Here.

01:05:29.005 --> 01:05:31.974
We did it, Cotton!
We did it, Angel!

01:05:32.042 --> 01:05:35.409
Angel... he go to your bed?

01:05:35.478 --> 01:05:36.968
No.

01:05:37.647 --> 01:05:39.308
I think he do.

01:05:39.382 --> 01:05:40.781
No, Paloma.

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:42.647
I went to his bed.

01:05:43.453 --> 01:05:44.750
All right, enough talk.

01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:46.413
Out, out, out.
Come on.

01:05:50.827 --> 01:05:53.022
- Bitch! Bitch!
- Oh, my God!

01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:54.859
You American bitch!

01:05:55.098 --> 01:05:57.396
Bitch! Damn it!

01:05:57.467 --> 01:06:00.129
- Let me go!
- I got her, I got her!

01:06:00.203 --> 01:06:02.967
I kill you! I kill you!

01:06:04.574 --> 01:06:07.008
Bitch! Unlock the door!

01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:09.309
I kill you!

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:10.902
There.

01:06:10.979 --> 01:06:12.503
Now what do we do with her?

01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:13.673
Leave her there.

01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:15.273
No like her anyway.

01:06:17.486 --> 01:06:18.680
Hello?

01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:23.354
Miss McGillvary!

01:06:23.425 --> 01:06:26.223
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

01:06:26.295 --> 01:06:28.786
Come out wherever you are!

01:06:51.053 --> 01:06:52.077
Sorry.

01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:55.588
We are going to have to stop dancing
and get some rest.

01:06:57.493 --> 01:07:00.723
Horses and bulls ship out tomorrow
and the following day, I fight.

01:07:00.795 --> 01:07:02.285
- You do?
- Yes.

01:07:02.363 --> 01:07:05.332
And from the looks of things,
your friend can't drive.

01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:09.431
So everybody will stay here.

01:07:51.578 --> 01:07:54.775
How awful for him!
No one comes to see him.

01:08:12.032 --> 01:08:15.229
- Can't they see the beauty in that?
- This is too different for them.

01:08:15.302 --> 01:08:17.566
It is always the other way,
with the killing.

01:08:23.243 --> 01:08:27.805
He should be in a big beautiful ring
with thousands of people cheering him on,

01:08:27.881 --> 01:08:31.510
not here with a few people
wondering what he is.

01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:48.495
They want the killing, Mac.
They want the blood.

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:05.747
Marie, go!

01:09:06.252 --> 01:09:07.776
Go, Marie!

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:11.683
Marie, please, shut up!

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:13.384
Go! Go!

01:09:14.093 --> 01:09:16.926
How is the horse?
Is he hurt?

01:09:16.996 --> 01:09:18.020
Fine, fine.

01:09:18.096 --> 01:09:20.395
Are you sure?

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:22.093
Take Marie home.

01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:23.497
Do what?
Do what?

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:25.627
The dog... Marie.
Take her home.

01:09:26.738 --> 01:09:28.366
I'm all right.

01:09:29.907 --> 01:09:31.568
You're all right?
Really, you're all right?

01:09:31.643 --> 01:09:33.076
I'm fine.

01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:37.377
He's alive, and I just don't care.

01:09:37.915 --> 01:09:43.876
Mac, I know I sound cruel,
but that's romantic gobbledygook.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.578
It's not.

01:09:46.491 --> 01:09:50.951
Mac, you don't care
if he can never make love to you again?

01:09:54.866 --> 01:09:56.299
No, I don't care.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:02.734
Mac, one time in your life...
that's going to be it.

01:10:05.143 --> 01:10:06.804
Well, it looks like it may be.

01:10:06.878 --> 01:10:08.505
Jesus Christ.

01:10:11.049 --> 01:10:12.414
This really stinks.

01:10:20.057 --> 01:10:21.319
It's all right.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:24.360
In a couple of weeks,
he'll be as good as new.

01:10:25.562 --> 01:10:27.189
Not really.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.336
All they said was
he most probably won't be able to.

01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:37.237
Probably.

01:10:37.307 --> 01:10:39.639
That means there's a chance.

01:10:40.644 --> 01:10:43.010
That's a pretty strong probably.

01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:48.581
Okay, forget about how you feel
for a minute, okay?

01:10:48.652 --> 01:10:50.279
What about him?

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:54.284
Can you imagine what's going on
inside him right now?

01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:56.986
Jesus. Jesus.

01:10:57.627 --> 01:11:01.256
Cat, I'm just not gonna believe
what they say.

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:04.562
Okay, tiger. Okay.

01:11:04.634 --> 01:11:06.295
Hey, tiger.

01:11:06.703 --> 01:11:08.671
I'm going to be one.

01:11:09.972 --> 01:11:10.961
May I come in?

01:11:12.775 --> 01:11:14.572
Do you have a minute?

01:11:15.544 --> 01:11:16.875
I have a minute.

01:11:22.318 --> 01:11:25.549
Now, pay attention and concentrate
on what I'm about to say.

01:11:26.589 --> 01:11:29.615
- Are you concentrating?
- I'm trying.

01:11:29.692 --> 01:11:30.750
All right.

01:11:32.595 --> 01:11:33.892
Now give me your hand.

01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:46.198
Will you marry me?

01:11:50.446 --> 01:11:52.812
Pay attention!
I'm proposing.

01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:55.578
I will ask you again.

01:11:56.285 --> 01:11:59.448
Will you marry me?

01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:02.513
I would marry you in a minute!
In a second!

01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:06.951
But as I'm sure you know,
I have no right to.

01:12:07.028 --> 01:12:08.723
Not now.

01:12:10.665 --> 01:12:12.929
- Because of...
- Yes! Because of!

01:12:15.503 --> 01:12:17.664
All right. Okay.

01:12:19.707 --> 01:12:21.106
Consider this, then.

01:12:23.578 --> 01:12:26.570
You teach me
everything you can do with these horses.

01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:33.314
And watch me and grow to love me
more and more each day.

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:40.984
And then soon, the prediction
of the doomsday doctors is no longer true.

01:12:42.664 --> 01:12:46.327
And then you can sweep me
into your arms and drag me to the altar.

01:12:48.269 --> 01:12:50.668
And then we can live happily ever after.

01:12:53.807 --> 01:12:55.672
Can't we make a deal to do this?

01:13:00.614 --> 01:13:02.138
Some of it for sure.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.277
I'll accept that for now.

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:11.789
Do you like the outfit?

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.986
Don't answer that.

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:15.619
I love it.
I may never take it off.

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:18.823
That thing is going to work.

01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:22.363
I guarantee you this.

01:13:32.613 --> 01:13:33.739
Hello?

01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:36.342
Hello?

01:13:38.252 --> 01:13:39.344
Excuse me.

01:13:40.286 --> 01:13:41.446
You calling me?

01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:47.187
Miss McGillvary told me
I'd find Catalina Terry in the winery.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.557
Are you she?

01:13:48.628 --> 01:13:52.758
Yeah. That's me, that's me,
that's me, that's me, that's me.

01:13:52.832 --> 01:13:54.823
That's me, that's me.
How do you do?

01:13:56.002 --> 01:13:57.196
Sorry.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:58.964
That's okay.

01:13:59.038 --> 01:14:00.505
Who are you?

01:14:00.573 --> 01:14:02.063
Robert Stewart.

01:14:02.141 --> 01:14:03.472
Pleased to meet you.

01:14:03.543 --> 01:14:04.908
Nice to meet you.

01:14:04.977 --> 01:14:07.605
I'm one of Miss McGillvary's solicitors.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.376
- Attorney solicitor?
- Yes, she told me about you.

01:14:12.852 --> 01:14:14.217
You're handsome.

01:14:14.287 --> 01:14:15.686
So handsome!

01:14:16.556 --> 01:14:20.686
Are you going to help me
to make a big company out of this?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.557
I shall try my best.

01:14:23.362 --> 01:14:25.193
What do you wear under that thing?

01:14:25.264 --> 01:14:27.232
Everybody jokes about that.

01:14:27.967 --> 01:14:31.629
To learn that,
you must get to know me much better.

01:14:31.703 --> 01:14:32.829
What?

01:14:32.904 --> 01:14:35.134
To know me much better.

01:14:35.807 --> 01:14:37.468
Do you like virgins?

01:14:37.542 --> 01:14:39.169
I don't understand.

01:14:39.244 --> 01:14:40.472
Virgins.

01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:42.672
Do you like virgins?

01:14:42.747 --> 01:14:43.975
Virgins?

01:14:44.049 --> 01:14:45.482
Yes!

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.348
I'm afraid I'm not
a connoisseur of virgins.

01:14:49.387 --> 01:14:51.321
Are there connoisseurs of virgins?

01:14:51.389 --> 01:14:53.084
How strange.

01:14:54.659 --> 01:14:58.823
Why you won't tell me
what do you have under that skirt?

01:14:58.897 --> 01:15:00.489
What is under your skirt?

01:15:01.199 --> 01:15:05.602
Listen, if we are going to be friends,
you'll no more be calling this kilt a skirt.

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:06.762
Is that clear?

01:15:06.838 --> 01:15:07.998
What?

01:15:08.073 --> 01:15:09.267
What? Tell me!

01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:11.536
Don't call the kilt a skirt!

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:13.874
It isn't a skirt.
It's a kilt!

01:15:13.945 --> 01:15:15.276
Is that clear?

01:15:15.347 --> 01:15:18.043
Yes, very clear.
Absolutely.

01:15:29.193 --> 01:15:35.598
Eight days and that sulking, pouting
little boy stays in his room like Scrooge.

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:38.066
Put a thing so I can put a thing.

01:15:40.371 --> 01:15:41.861
It's not easy.

01:15:41.939 --> 01:15:43.668
Sure it's easy.

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.573
Put this one.

01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:48.705
Okay, let's see what you can do.

01:15:51.181 --> 01:15:53.081
Easy. I win.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:56.610
No?

01:15:56.687 --> 01:15:58.518
You win, yes.

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.186
And now I'm going
to go to bed and cry.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.784
Let's take a walk.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.527
Me, too.

01:16:07.598 --> 01:16:09.190
I go to cry.

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.030
Cry Angel.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.103
Every night.

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:17.829
Cry Angel.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.601
No, really, Cotton.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.839
I'd rather be in bed crying.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:26.848
A very short walk.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:29.074
Very, very short.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.551
I know.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:40.153
But you may be wanting marriage
because of this, rather than in spite of it.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.698
That's part of what
I'm going to go cry about.

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:49.334
If you'll let me go to bed.

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:54.905
As long as you understand,
then you're dismissed.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.011
I love you, Cotton.

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:00.476
Me, too.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:07.152
You were really a cowboy?

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:11.423
I was until I got so big,
the horses figured they oughta ride me.

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:16.519
Did you kiss your horse
like in a moving picture?

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:19.692
I kissed them better than anybody.

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:27.236
I was a... a really good kisser.

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.617
You wait.

01:18:34.308 --> 01:18:36.105
¿ Qué pasa, Paloma?

01:18:36.177 --> 01:18:39.270
Help! Help!

01:19:11.411 --> 01:19:12.776
Well?

01:19:12.846 --> 01:19:14.814
It must be her.
She's not in her room.

01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:16.644
Evita, get the men!
Give them guns.

01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:18.149
Get the cars! Now!

01:19:18.218 --> 01:19:20.652
Hurry! Now!

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.551
Really? They stole her?

01:19:30.262 --> 01:19:31.695
There's no key.

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:35.157
The truck, the truck, the truck!

01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:36.360
Come on, Paloma!

01:19:39.037 --> 01:19:40.026
Hurry!

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:43.704
¡Caramba!

01:19:43.775 --> 01:19:45.504
Esperadme.
Esperadme.

01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:47.408
Come on.
What you waiting for?

01:20:01.293 --> 01:20:02.726
¿Dónde está Cotton?

01:20:07.799 --> 01:20:10.290
They was stolen her
because she's so rich.

01:20:10.369 --> 01:20:12.234
I hope so, Paloma.

01:20:12.304 --> 01:20:14.169
I hope that's all it is.

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:18.876
Drive fast!

01:20:27.952 --> 01:20:30.147
Why are you doing this to me?

01:20:30.221 --> 01:20:33.520
If you still have your virginity, I want it.

01:20:33.591 --> 01:20:35.923
I don't have it anymore!

01:20:35.993 --> 01:20:37.585
That's sad for me.

01:20:37.662 --> 01:20:38.993
But no matter.

01:20:39.063 --> 01:20:41.224
I want you to live with me forever.

01:20:41.766 --> 01:20:42.926
And I take you now!

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.934
Like my father took my mother!

01:21:00.685 --> 01:21:01.913
Hold on, Mac!

01:21:05.289 --> 01:21:06.449
Yes!

01:21:11.494 --> 01:21:14.691
Yes, Cotton!
Thank you, thank you!

01:21:53.003 --> 01:21:54.129
You f...!

01:21:58.441 --> 01:22:02.433
My sheik,
your thought is very beautiful.

01:22:05.414 --> 01:22:06.881
And I'm very flattered.

01:22:06.949 --> 01:22:08.507
But I'm in love.

01:22:09.051 --> 01:22:11.281
Down there.
I'm in love!

01:22:11.353 --> 01:22:14.686
I'm sorry, but I do have my needs.

01:22:15.991 --> 01:22:18.289
It's a chauvinistic world!

01:22:19.995 --> 01:22:21.656
What I do is correct.

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:24.028
I know you have your needs.

01:22:24.099 --> 01:22:25.623
We all do!

01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:30.933
But... I'm very flattered
that you consider me one of yours.

01:22:31.573 --> 01:22:35.009
But I must be selfish
and think of myself first.

01:22:38.414 --> 01:22:42.646
I say he was eh-stolen you
because you're so rich.

01:22:42.718 --> 01:22:47.155
No. He "eh-stolen" me
because I so cute.

01:22:50.892 --> 01:22:52.553
You know, Angel walk.

01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:58.925
¡Alta, Marie!

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:02.596
¡Alta, Marie!

01:23:04.539 --> 01:23:06.666
You don't think
you should come out into the sun?

01:23:06.741 --> 01:23:09.301
Maybe look around,
watch me ride?

01:23:09.377 --> 01:23:12.369
You know, you're days and days behind
in your loving me.

01:23:12.447 --> 01:23:16.884
Thank you, but Marie and I
are learning new tricks.

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:18.578
Hello, Marie.

01:23:20.588 --> 01:23:21.816
As you wish.

01:23:21.889 --> 01:23:24.687
I brought you some more
sweet little companions.

01:23:26.394 --> 01:23:29.625
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!

01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:45.908
Did the lovebirds send you
my message?

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:47.947
I've got your message.

01:25:20.038 --> 01:25:21.164
I did it!

01:25:31.216 --> 01:25:35.209
Today he let me hug him,
and he even hugged me back.

01:25:37.188 --> 01:25:39.588
And now he's back in his room
like a hermit.

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:43.055
A hug beats a kick in the butt.

01:25:44.896 --> 01:25:47.126
And Rome wasn't built in a day, I know.

01:25:47.198 --> 01:25:49.291
Who said that?
I never said that.

01:25:58.843 --> 01:26:01.641
You want I give you
some more hot chocolate?

01:26:01.713 --> 01:26:03.305
Yes, please.

01:26:05.383 --> 01:26:07.908
Put two spoons of patience
in hers, please?

01:26:07.986 --> 01:26:10.112
- Put what?
- Never mind.

01:26:10.187 --> 01:26:12.280
Do you want I give you some, too?

01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:15.888
Okay, good night, everybody.
I'm going to bed.

01:26:17.127 --> 01:26:18.924
Why you go to bed so early?

01:26:18.996 --> 01:26:22.796
No, Paloma.
For me, it's very, very late.

01:26:24.301 --> 01:26:25.495
Night.

01:26:25.569 --> 01:26:26.797
Good night.

01:26:27.704 --> 01:26:28.728
Good night.

01:26:38.782 --> 01:26:41.615
Thank you for taking them off first.

01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:49.988
For you, it is a pleasure, Catalina.

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.857
Fantastic.

01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:55.898
I can't believe we are doing this.

01:26:57.267 --> 01:26:59.632
I can't believe I am happy
we are doing this.

01:27:02.204 --> 01:27:03.899
But to do it properly,

01:27:03.973 --> 01:27:06.601
you're going to have
to take off your clothes.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:16.380
Listen... why don't you do it for me?

01:27:17.119 --> 01:27:19.519
- Take your clothes off, you mean?
- Yes.

01:27:25.995 --> 01:27:32.491
I hope you think I am as beautiful
with my clothes off as I think you are.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.015
This is unbelievable.

01:27:56.257 --> 01:27:57.485
I love it.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.821
And the hurt... I love the hurt.

01:28:00.895 --> 01:28:02.692
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.097
Do you love me?

01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:10.062
I do.

01:28:10.138 --> 01:28:13.130
Right now, I really do love you.

01:28:14.476 --> 01:28:16.410
I know right now you love me.

01:28:17.145 --> 01:28:23.345
And listen, if I want... I want your love,
we better not stop doing this.

01:28:23.418 --> 01:28:28.549
That would be the most wonderful way
to spend forever.

01:28:28.623 --> 01:28:31.888
- I don't think I'm up to it.
- What?

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.191
But if we cannot, I could still love you.

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.690
You're a hard man to seduce.

01:29:18.772 --> 01:29:25.701
Listen, Angel, we made a deal for over
300,000 bottles to the United States.

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.675
We ship them out next week...
I mean, next month.

01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:32.183
Can you believe it?

01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:34.116
It's fantastic.

01:29:38.925 --> 01:29:40.358
Listen, Catalina.

01:29:40.426 --> 01:29:43.953
I'm getting the feeling that you haven't
kept me here most of the day

01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:46.828
just to show me your sales reports.

01:29:48.334 --> 01:29:51.098
No, no.
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

01:29:51.604 --> 01:29:55.973
Mac asked me to keep you away
from the ring for a while today,

01:29:56.042 --> 01:29:59.011
and I think I've done very well.

01:29:59.579 --> 01:30:02.173
Why would she want me
away from the ring?

01:30:16.562 --> 01:30:17.961
Hey, toro!

01:30:37.716 --> 01:30:38.842
Bravo!

01:31:00.238 --> 01:31:02.763
Bravo! Bravo!

01:32:03.066 --> 01:32:05.899
I've done this
to get your undivided attention,

01:32:05.969 --> 01:32:08.563
to tell you that I will see you at sunrise.

01:32:19.515 --> 01:32:21.710
You do remember sunrise, don't you?

01:32:28.024 --> 01:32:29.491
This better work.

01:32:30.627 --> 01:32:34.586
I sure wanna be the duchess of Piores.

01:32:34.664 --> 01:32:38.725
I'm sorry, Paloma,
but if this works my way,

01:32:38.801 --> 01:32:41.565
I promise I'll find you another.

01:32:42.171 --> 01:32:43.832
I'll give him to you.

01:32:45.441 --> 01:32:47.909
Tonight be good night.

01:32:47.977 --> 01:32:51.343
Angel be a man for you.

01:33:40.594 --> 01:33:42.425
Happy sunrise.

01:33:42.496 --> 01:33:44.794
Mac, this is not going to work.

01:33:44.865 --> 01:33:46.298
Hold it right there!
Hold it!

01:33:48.602 --> 01:33:49.728
Damn.

01:33:49.804 --> 01:33:51.271
Come on, Marie.
Out you go.

01:33:51.338 --> 01:33:52.600
He's mine now.
Come on.

01:33:52.673 --> 01:33:53.970
Out you go.

01:33:58.279 --> 01:33:59.746
Hats are bad luck on beds.

01:33:59.814 --> 01:34:01.679
You oughta know better than that.

01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:05.244
Did I ride the horse
marvelously today?

01:34:05.319 --> 01:34:07.617
Even more marvelously than you?

01:34:07.688 --> 01:34:09.019
I did, didn't I?

01:34:12.693 --> 01:34:14.285
All right, off the bed.

01:34:14.361 --> 01:34:16.522
Come on.
Come on! Off the bed!

01:34:16.597 --> 01:34:18.724
- What are you doing?
- Off the bed!

01:34:18.799 --> 01:34:20.266
What are you doing?

01:34:24.805 --> 01:34:25.999
Come on.

01:34:32.645 --> 01:34:34.670
That's not the way we did it last time.

01:34:36.382 --> 01:34:38.373
But then I was a little girl.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.251
Now I'm a woman.

01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:45.557
You want to taste my blood?

01:34:57.137 --> 01:34:58.399
Damn you!

01:34:59.939 --> 01:35:01.497
Don't do this to me.

01:35:15.355 --> 01:35:19.188
Don't take it out on me just because
you got cute with the damn bull.

01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:35.272
This is a very strange vigil
we all seem to have gathered for.

01:35:36.074 --> 01:35:37.837
What are we here to do?

01:35:38.710 --> 01:35:40.507
We're here to help Angel and Mac.

01:35:42.581 --> 01:35:44.446
We cannot help Angel.

01:35:45.918 --> 01:35:47.977
Angel have to be a man.

01:35:49.955 --> 01:35:51.479
Is no problem.

01:35:58.297 --> 01:36:00.891
You say that we never found ecstasy.

01:36:02.167 --> 01:36:04.067
That it was like quicksilver,

01:36:04.136 --> 01:36:06.696
always promising next time.

01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:14.440
I want ecstasy.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.079
Let's find it.

01:36:19.917 --> 01:36:21.646
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

01:36:22.687 --> 01:36:24.712
Make me whole again!

01:36:27.925 --> 01:36:29.552
I guaranteed it!

01:37:00.824 --> 01:37:03.054
Fourteen.

01:37:03.126 --> 01:37:04.787
Shame on you.

01:37:06.162 --> 01:37:08.323
Was she as wild then?

01:37:08.398 --> 01:37:10.263
Did she scratch you?

01:37:10.333 --> 01:37:13.632
Long wicked scratches?

01:37:16.339 --> 01:37:17.829
She did, didn't she?

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:20.168
And you loved it.

01:37:22.279 --> 01:37:25.908
I think this seems like a perfect time
to tell you that I love you.

01:37:29.319 --> 01:37:32.777
And an equally perfect time for you
to tell me the same?

01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:34.948
I do.

01:37:35.025 --> 01:37:36.151
I'm sure.

01:37:36.226 --> 01:37:38.694
Beyond your wildest dreams.

01:37:39.829 --> 01:37:44.289
Well, my dreams take me
beyond infinity.

01:37:45.769 --> 01:37:48.033
What love you must have for me.

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:04.219
I guaranteed it.

01:38:33.882 --> 01:38:35.144
Bravo!

01:38:35.217 --> 01:38:36.946
You... bravo.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.348
Look.

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:28.286
"X." I was right.

01:42:18.835 --> 01:42:21.895
Angel, my foot.
My foot is cramped.

01:42:23.273 --> 01:42:25.241
Angel, give me back my foot, please.

01:42:27.344 --> 01:42:28.743
Oh, God.

01:42:28.812 --> 01:42:30.712
I'm sorry.

01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:32.408
Thank you.
