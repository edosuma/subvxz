08:55.250 --> 08:57.190
We would need to do
some tests to confirm,

08:57.290 --> 09:01.030
but I'm expecting it to be
heavy metal poisoning.

09:01.130 --> 09:03.030
Does the bird have a name?

09:03.130 --> 09:04.231
Uh, Turtle.

09:04.331 --> 09:05.551
Bird's name's Turtle.

09:15.131 --> 09:17.631
There's reno after reno,
but the birds

09:17.731 --> 09:19.431
can still peck through
the layers of paint

to the original lead coating.

09:22.332 --> 09:23.752
Oh.

09:23.852 --> 09:26.712
So to confirm a diagnosis,

09:26.812 --> 09:29.792
we would need to do
a preliminary blood test,

09:29.892 --> 09:30.912
an X-ray.

09:31.012 --> 09:33.792
I'm afraid he's likely had
a small seizure,

09:33.892 --> 09:35.712
so anticonvulsants
would be an option.

09:35.812 --> 09:39.032
And if toxicosis is confirmed,

09:39.132 --> 09:41.033
we'd treat him
with fluid therapy.

09:41.133 --> 09:42.873
What's that?

09:42.973 --> 09:47.073
It's akin to kidney dialysis
in humans.

09:47.173 --> 09:48.393
Dialysis?

09:48.493 --> 09:50.113
We wouldn't expect
that we'll need to remove

09:50.213 --> 09:51.833
any particles surgically,

09:51.933 --> 09:54.313
but the X-ray
would tell us that.

09:54.413 --> 09:58.214
That would be a more
substantial form of treatment.

09:59.374 --> 10:00.954
The cost of diagnosis
and treatment

10:01.054 --> 10:03.054
might be something
you'd like to think about.

10:11.254 --> 10:13.394

it's a difficult decision,

10:13.494 --> 10:15.995

not to proceed,

10:16.095 --> 10:18.095
