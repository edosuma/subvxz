WEBVTT

00:02.902 --> 00:04.533
Into thin air, send this chair.

00:05.968 --> 00:09.667
Hmmm. This doesn't seem right.

00:11.767 --> 00:12.700
Help! Somebody help!

00:12.734 --> 00:15.534
Max? Max?

00:15.568 --> 00:17.601
Du... Where are you?

00:17.635 --> 00:19.168
I'm right here.

00:19.202 --> 00:21.832
I was trying to make Dad's
chair disappear and...

00:21.867 --> 00:23.765
Well, you can figure out the rest.

00:25.568 --> 00:29.335
Yeah, and I figure...
you're holding the wand backwards.

00:30.536 --> 00:33.155
No, well... Oh, maybe a little.

00:35.061 --> 00:36.994
Into thin air, send this chair.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.396
I hope you know how to
get Dad's chair back.

00:45.431 --> 00:48.231
Of course I don't.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.667
Justin, I'm starting
to think Dad's right.

00:52.068 --> 00:54.801
If I'm gonna have any chance of
winning this wizard competition,

00:54.836 --> 00:57.103
I'm gonna need a tutor.

00:57.137 --> 00:59.936
Dad's hiring you a wizard tutor?

00:59.971 --> 01:03.439
The best tutor around is right here.
That's an insult to me.

01:03.473 --> 01:05.074
I tutor tutors!

01:06.475 --> 01:08.208
I heard yelling.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.776
Is Justin being passionate
about knowledge again?

01:12.912 --> 01:13.878
Max?

01:13.913 --> 01:15.345
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:15.447 --> 01:18.447
Guess what? Dad's hiring
a wizard tutor for Max.

01:18.481 --> 01:21.916
Wait, if Dad got Max a tutor,

01:21.950 --> 01:24.084
that means I'm probably next.

01:24.118 --> 01:29.589
Why am I saying,
"probably"? I'm next. Oh...

01:37.560 --> 01:40.994
Yep, just be yourself.
That always gets rid of people.

01:41.029 --> 01:44.097
You're so funny!

01:45.699 --> 01:49.667
Guys, I think my tutor's here.
I hope it's a wise old owl.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.339
Hi.

01:56.373 --> 02:01.375
Aw. You're not an old owl,
just a cute blonde chick.

02:02.510 --> 02:04.444
Get rid of her.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.514
I'm Tutor Hatchback.
I'm here to tutor Max Russo.

02:10.549 --> 02:12.282
And something tells me you're him.

02:12.717 --> 02:15.784
Yeah, that something's right.
That's him right there. Uh-huh.

02:15.819 --> 02:18.587
And that's uh... That's uh...

02:18.621 --> 02:21.155
That's Alex, right over there.
And... I'm...

02:21.190 --> 02:23.190
I'm... I'm...

02:23.224 --> 02:25.592
Am I supposed to tutor him, too?

02:25.626 --> 02:29.062
Him? No. In fact, your services
aren't really needed here at all

02:29.097 --> 02:31.431
because my brother has a
vast knowledge of wizardry

02:31.598 --> 02:34.600
that may shame you into leaving
here in disgrace, right, Justin?

02:35.535 --> 02:37.568
Justin?!

02:42.505 --> 02:46.907
We are so honored to have you
here to tutor our dear brother.

02:46.942 --> 02:59.116
If there is anything
that you need, just ask.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.718
? Is that u  t is a pretty face?

03:01.752 --> 03:03.853
Guys are so easy.

03:04.821 --> 03:06.622
Yeah, we're pretty easy.

03:08.257 --> 03:10.224
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

03:10.659 --> 03:12.092
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

03:12.760 --> 03:14.428
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

03:14.462 --> 03:15.929
* Yes, please *

03:16.130 --> 03:17.797
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

03:18.365 --> 03:19.565
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

03:20.333 --> 03:22.534
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

03:22.568 --> 03:24.102
* That's what I said *

03:24.136 --> 03:26.904
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:26.938 --> 03:30.808
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

03:30.842 --> 03:34.646
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

03:34.681 --> 03:39.150
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

03:39.184 --> 03:42.286
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:42.320 --> 03:46.525
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

03:46.560 --> 03:49.895
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

03:49.929 --> 03:51.443
* Because everything is not... *

04:07.027 --> 04:09.777
You'll be surprised how many
kids hold their wands backwards.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:25.811 --> 04:28.046
I'm sorry, Max.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.598
You're holding your wand right,
but don't grip it so tight.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.234
You're not Judy Axe-Hand.

04:33.575 --> 04:36.244
Whoa. You...
You read Judy Axe-Hand?

04:36.278 --> 04:38.312
That's like the best wizard
comic book out there.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.815
Yeah. By "best" do you mean the
one that's not totally lame?

04:40.849 --> 04:42.816
Yes! I have the whole series.

04:42.851 --> 04:45.319
- I'll go get them. Hang on.
- OK.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.754
I like you.
Hope you don't wreck it.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.624
Hey, tutor. I, uh...

04:52.659 --> 04:55.594
I brought you some of my personal
study aids to help you with Max.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.532
Get out of here. I'm starting
a friendship thing here.

05:00.566 --> 05:04.602
Friendship? Not if I make
her my girlfriend first.

05:10.675 --> 05:13.376
Oh, my gosh!

05:13.410 --> 05:16.846
You have My First Spell-Caster,
a set of training wands,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.015
and even Merlin Flash Cards.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.617
Ooh.

05:22.719 --> 05:24.220
And... Oh, OK.

05:25.755 --> 05:28.622
I used to play with
those when I was a kid.

05:28.657 --> 05:30.791
But you were using them last night.

05:30.825 --> 05:32.759
Zip it.

05:34.061 --> 05:36.896
So, uh, Tutor, um, do you ever,

05:36.930 --> 05:40.866
I don't know, tutor people
on asking anyone out?

05:40.900 --> 05:43.067
Well, who do you wanna ask out?

05:43.835 --> 05:46.803
Uh, well, I... You.

05:48.506 --> 05:51.441
You don't need a tutor.
You're doing just fine.

05:51.475 --> 05:54.876
Um, have you ever been to The
Leprechaun Grill in the wizard world?

05:54.911 --> 05:58.679
No. I love leprechauns,
but they make me nervous.

05:58.714 --> 06:02.083
I try to avoid
situations that emphasize

06:02.117 --> 06:04.918
my... awkwardness.

06:07.621 --> 06:09.389
I'm sure you'll fit in just fine.

06:09.657 --> 06:12.125
That's what my mom says every
day before I go to school.

06:12.159 --> 06:15.195
Thank you.

06:17.097 --> 06:21.201
So, she's a tutor named Tutor?
Isn't that weird?

06:21.235 --> 06:24.238
Well, no, not in the
wizard world, at least.

06:24.272 --> 06:27.674
A lot of people name their kids what
they want them to grow up to be.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.442
But sometimes it doesn't work out.

06:29.577 --> 06:32.279
My dad goes to a doctor
named Butcher. Anyway...

06:34.415 --> 06:37.750
Tutor is great. She's into
all the same things I'm into.

06:37.785 --> 06:39.319
Well, so am I.

06:39.353 --> 06:41.555
I don't want to sound as
insecure as I really am,

06:41.856 --> 06:44.557
but you're not trying to replace
me with that Tutor chick, are you?

06:45.859 --> 06:47.193
Harper...

06:48.662 --> 06:51.497
...you're wearing a dress
made of fruit roll snacks.

06:51.531 --> 06:54.199
No one could ever replace you.
Believe me.

06:54.234 --> 06:57.470
Good, because I may not
be your wizard friend,

06:57.504 --> 06:59.472
but I'm definitely
your best friend.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.774
Got a problem with that!?

07:04.344 --> 07:05.744
No.

07:07.347 --> 07:10.015
Hey, Alex. There you go. Thank you.

07:10.050 --> 07:13.986
Since your father is out of town,
he won't know if we close up early.

07:14.021 --> 07:17.490
How about I treat you gu to
makeovers at the department store?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.625
Makeovers?

07:19.660 --> 07:21.961
Where stuck-up girls
make snooty faces at us,

07:21.995 --> 07:24.063
while they pluck our
eyebrows until we scream,

07:24.498 --> 07:27.534
and then tell us, "You'd be pretty
if you took care of your skin"? Pass.

07:29.470 --> 07:32.505
This is not what I imagined
having a girl would be like.

07:32.539 --> 07:36.409
So you think it'd be OK if I brought
my shillelagh to The Leprechaun Grill?

07:36.443 --> 07:37.877
Where else would you take it?

07:39.246 --> 07:42.481
Mom, this is Max's tutor.

07:42.515 --> 07:45.117
Guess what? We're going
to The Leprechaun Grill.

07:45.152 --> 07:46.986
Hi, I'm Theresa.

07:47.220 --> 07:50.823
I'd ask you to come with us to get
makeovers, but you're already so beautiful.

07:50.858 --> 07:53.325
Way to boost our
self-esteem up, Mom.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.593
Oooh. I'd love to go.

07:55.628 --> 07:59.229
Really? Oh, great. I'll go get
my purse. Justin, close up.

08:01.999 --> 08:05.866
I'm disappointed in you, Tutor. I thought
we were on a nice road to friendship until
now.

08:05.901 --> 08:08.002
Oh, Alex, I'm sorry.

08:08.337 --> 08:11.838
I thought you might enjoy making fun of the
face-dance Sallys who work behind the
makeup counter.

08:11.872 --> 08:15.774
Oh, my gosh! I totally
call them that too!

08:15.809 --> 08:17.910
We're so back on the
road to friendship.

08:29.656 --> 08:31.924
- This is The Leprechaun Grill?
- Yeah.

08:32.225 --> 08:35.527
By the way, I love your green tuxedo,
Justin. The shillelagh really makes it.

08:36.995 --> 08:37.962
Thanks.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.897
What's wrong?

08:39.931 --> 08:42.799
Nothing, I mean,
I'm glad to be here with you.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.936
It's just I thought there'd be real
leprechauns running around here.

08:45.970 --> 08:50.940
This is... Look, these workers
are just dressed as leprechauns.

08:50.975 --> 08:54.376
Yeah, but I heard they train their
workers to act just like leprechauns.

08:55.478 --> 08:56.511
What the hay.

08:59.180 --> 09:03.149
Sure and Begorrah,
welcome to The Leprechaun Grill.

09:03.184 --> 09:08.220
Would you like to try our new
Pot-'O-Gold Mini Tostadas?

09:09.956 --> 09:12.924
Mini Tostadas?

09:12.959 --> 09:16.027
Is there anything here
that's genuine leprechaun?

09:17.230 --> 09:18.962
There's a leprechaun
in a box over there.

09:23.832 --> 09:26.233
Whatcha be lookin' at?!

09:30.704 --> 09:32.638
Why is he in there?

09:33.006 --> 09:35.741
Corporate makes us have a leprechaun
to make the place look real.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.644
Plus, that one's a little grouchy
so we have to keep him in that box.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.981
So, you gonna order something?

09:43.015 --> 09:45.683
Hey, guys. Wow.

09:45.718 --> 09:50.087
Only you could make a green tuxedo
stand out in a leprechaun joint.

09:51.856 --> 09:53.223
What are you doing here, Alex?

09:53.324 --> 09:55.058
I came to bring you your wallet.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.593
I didn't forget my wallet.
I have mine right here.

09:58.829 --> 10:00.229
Then good thing I made you check.

10:00.263 --> 10:02.397
Hey, Tutor.

10:02.432 --> 10:06.301
How fun was it telling that make-over
girl she had to put a bag over her head

10:06.335 --> 10:08.302
because she was too beautiful?

10:08.337 --> 10:09.870
And she did it!

10:09.904 --> 10:13.039
It's official:
Make-over girls are dumb.

10:15.209 --> 10:18.443
Guess what? There's troll wrestling
at the Wizardome. Wanna go?

10:18.478 --> 10:19.910
Sure.

10:19.944 --> 10:21.411
Alex, we're on a date.

10:21.745 --> 10:24.413
Oh, relax, Justin. Wrestling
doesn't start for another hour.

10:24.447 --> 10:28.783
You can finish your date while I
poke that leprechaun with your stick.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.095
That's a lot of anger
in a tiny body.

10:43.299 --> 10:45.233
A bully hippogriff is
riding off with your bike.

10:45.268 --> 10:46.667
What do you do to stop him?

10:46.702 --> 10:49.136
Archery and plumbing is the way

10:49.170 --> 10:51.972
to keep that thief
from getting away.

10:52.006 --> 10:54.375
Yay! Excellent! Good job!

10:58.213 --> 10:59.813
I caught a hippogriff.

11:08.657 --> 11:11.358
Stop messing around, dude.
Tutor's trying to help you.

11:11.392 --> 11:14.994
Actually, that was part of a practice quiz.
Max is doing pretty well.

11:15.029 --> 11:18.630
Oh, yeah. I'm doing pretty well.

11:18.664 --> 11:21.532
At what?

11:21.567 --> 11:24.034
Hey, Tutor. Wanna go
to the wizard mall

11:24.069 --> 11:26.536
and watch cyclopses
try on sunglasses?

11:26.571 --> 11:29.072
First of all,
it's not "cyclopses-es-es."

11:29.106 --> 11:32.208
It's just cyclops.

11:32.243 --> 11:34.010
Who cares?

11:36.313 --> 11:39.649
And second, I was gonna ask Tutor
to do something with me first.

11:39.684 --> 11:41.518
Oh, OK. Let's go, Tutor.

11:41.653 --> 11:45.422
Sorry, I can't go with
either of you. - Oh, come on.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.558
I've got to finish
tutoring Max for this test

11:47.592 --> 11:49.293
so I can move on
to my next student.

11:50.862 --> 11:52.730
You're gonna leave?

11:52.764 --> 11:54.365
Yep.

11:54.399 --> 11:57.401
Well, yeah, but we
can still be friends

11:57.436 --> 11:59.037
and do stuff together, right?

11:59.071 --> 12:01.506
No. The Wizard Council
has a strict policy

12:01.540 --> 12:03.908
about tutors hanging around
after their work is done.

12:04.109 --> 12:07.611
Anyway, if you guys don't mind,
we've got to get back to studying.

12:07.646 --> 12:12.349
Studying. That's what we're doing.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.084
Yes!

12:18.257 --> 12:20.157
She can't leave.

12:20.192 --> 12:23.127
She's the first wizard girl I've
ever met who's actually normal.

12:23.161 --> 12:26.797
Most wizard girls are all like,
"Hee hee hee, I'm a wizard!

12:27.932 --> 12:29.799
Wizard girls don't talk like that.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.801
In my mind they do.

12:31.836 --> 12:35.005
You didn't have a chance with
her anyway, 'cause you're all,

12:35.040 --> 12:38.609
"I'm Alex. I'm so tough I
don't need to be nice."

12:39.678 --> 12:41.178
I don't talk like that.

12:41.213 --> 12:42.914
In my mind you do.

12:44.216 --> 12:46.384
It doesn't matter anyway.
Max ruined it for us.

12:46.419 --> 12:49.721
I can't believe the kid
picks now to start learning.

12:50.890 --> 12:54.527
Well, you know,
the test isn't until tomorrow,

12:54.561 --> 12:58.597
Maybe we can find a couple of
tutors to help him unlearn.

12:58.632 --> 13:01.801
Where are we going to find a
couple of tutors at this late hour?

13:01.835 --> 13:04.003
I know. Let me call someone.

13:12.312 --> 13:13.545
Hello?

13:14.947 --> 13:16.480
He... Oh!

13:18.852 --> 13:20.286
- Us.
- Yes.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.103
When in doubt, inside out.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.476
I did it. I'm going to
ace Tutor's wand quiz.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.447
What did you do?

13:37.482 --> 13:41.017
Oh, I released the sand
from that defective bottle.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.222
Anyway, I'm gonna get some rest and
turn in early. Goodnight, guys.

13:49.492 --> 13:54.095
Yep, turn in early.
First sign of a quitter.

13:54.130 --> 13:57.364
What? I've studied hard,
I've read all my spell workbooks

13:57.399 --> 14:00.534
and practiced my wand-eye
coordination. Oh...

14:00.568 --> 14:04.370
Ha! The real key to acing
a test is not any of that.

14:04.405 --> 14:05.772
It isn't?

14:07.641 --> 14:10.443
It isn't. No.

14:10.477 --> 14:13.679
Let me give you some
of my secret wand tips.

14:13.713 --> 14:19.117
For example, you should choke up
on your wand for better control.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.222
And the value of sleep is a myth.

14:24.256 --> 14:28.092
You need to stay awake and let your brain
soak up all the studying you've done.

14:28.126 --> 14:30.927
And the best way to do
that is to chill out

14:30.961 --> 14:35.864
and watch the all-night
Unicorn Attack marathon

14:35.898 --> 14:38.099
on the Wizcovery Channel.

14:40.102 --> 14:41.702
We don't know who
was more surprised,

14:42.036 --> 14:43.636
the unicorn or our cameraman.

14:48.572 --> 14:51.107
I know what you guys
are trying to do.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.009
- I knew it wouldn't work.
- Hold on.

14:53.043 --> 14:55.344
What do you think we're
trying to do, Max?

14:57.046 --> 15:00.716
You guys... are trying
to help me pass the quiz.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.818
See? False alarm.

15:10.558 --> 15:11.625
OK.

15:13.461 --> 15:17.363
You didn't get that one,
but let's try this one.

15:19.432 --> 15:20.732
Water to stardust.

15:22.401 --> 15:23.434
Wait.

15:30.107 --> 15:31.574
OK, go.

15:34.577 --> 15:36.410
Stardust!

15:37.112 --> 15:38.612
Oh!

15:42.651 --> 15:44.584
Aw, man.

15:46.253 --> 15:48.255
What was that noise?

15:48.289 --> 15:54.961
We were just outside talking about how
great Max must be doing on his quiz.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.565
I don't... I don't understand.
He was making great progress.

15:58.599 --> 16:01.969
What happened, Max? - I don't know.
Alex and Justin even helped me...

16:02.003 --> 16:04.270
Not really.

16:04.304 --> 16:06.238
Well, unfortunately
he failed the quiz.

16:06.373 --> 16:08.774
- What a shame.
- Oh, that's such... Oh, man.

16:08.809 --> 16:10.509
I guess I can't leave yet.

16:10.543 --> 16:11.743
Awesome! Tutor.

16:13.679 --> 16:16.996
What's your record for sneaking into
the movies in one day? Mine's five.

16:17.031 --> 16:19.534
Tutor, the Ancient Robe and
Hat exhibit just opened up

16:19.635 --> 16:22.471
at the Wiz-sonian Institute.
You want to go with me to the museum?

16:22.839 --> 16:26.176
Being with you is like being at a museum.
Not much to look at, and you're instantly
bored.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.878
Yeah.

16:27.912 --> 16:30.547
Why don't you guys go.
I'm gonna think of something better.

16:43.668 --> 16:47.002
Max, why are you sighing?

16:47.037 --> 16:49.438
I'm not. I'm just
taking a deep breath,

16:49.473 --> 16:52.240
because I'm disappointed and sad.

16:53.642 --> 16:55.476
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

16:55.510 --> 16:58.278
Mom, I failed the wand quiz.

16:58.312 --> 17:01.914
Oh. I'm sorry.

17:01.949 --> 17:03.515
What happened?

17:03.550 --> 17:06.584
I don't know. Alex and
Justin even helped me study.

17:08.286 --> 17:10.252
Alex helped you study, huh?

17:11.555 --> 17:13.622
Yeah, they showed me a
new way to hold my wand

17:13.656 --> 17:16.125
and they helped me relax
by watching TV all night.

17:16.159 --> 17:18.359
One question, honey.

17:18.394 --> 17:22.863
How did Justin and Alex react
when you failed the quiz?

17:22.896 --> 17:26.199
Happy. Then sad.

17:26.233 --> 17:30.135
Tutor said she had to stay.
Then happy again.

17:30.169 --> 17:32.937
Max, your brother and sister

17:32.972 --> 17:34.705
tricked you into failing the quiz

17:34.873 --> 17:36.473
just so Tutor wouldn't
have to leave yet.

17:36.507 --> 17:37.974
They used me?

17:38.009 --> 17:39.775
Yes, they did!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.410
As your mother, I have to tell you

17:41.778 --> 17:43.411
that taking revenge on
your brother and sister

17:43.445 --> 17:44.879
is not something I wanna hear.

17:46.247 --> 17:47.581
I didn't say revenge.

17:47.615 --> 17:49.282
I know. I know you didn't say it.

17:49.617 --> 17:52.351
I'm just saying if you said it,
I don't wanna hear it.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.553
If only there was a way
to get back at them.

17:55.588 --> 17:59.857
Oh, getting back at them.
That would be just fine.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.961
I can't believe it.
We snuck into seven movies.

18:05.996 --> 18:08.963
Yeah, we had a blast. Tutor,
you know, you're a great friend.

18:08.998 --> 18:12.933
You are, too. I'm sorry that soon Max won't
need me anymore. Then I'll have to leave.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.702
Oh, I'm not too worried about that.

18:15.736 --> 18:17.904
Psst! Hey!

18:19.339 --> 18:22.474
Oh, hey, it's Cranky O'Shorty.

18:22.508 --> 18:25.376
I'm famished.
I've been working all day.

18:25.410 --> 18:27.511
Can you spare some of those spuds?

18:28.613 --> 18:30.180
You mean one of these?

18:31.582 --> 18:33.116
Nope.

18:33.151 --> 18:36.119
Hey! Give it here!

18:36.153 --> 18:40.156
Tutor, I got us the tickets to
the Wiz-sonian. There you go.

18:40.190 --> 18:42.592
Too late. She already said
she wanted to be my friend.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.828
You did?

18:44.862 --> 18:47.497
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you and I can't go out, too.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.767
Um, look, Tutor, being my friend

18:52.802 --> 18:55.703
and also his girlfriend
isn't gonna work for us.

18:55.737 --> 18:58.138
We try to keep our
lives very separate.

18:58.173 --> 19:01.941
Yeah. We find it's better
for everyone that way.

19:01.976 --> 19:03.709
Mostly me.

19:03.744 --> 19:07.146
Well, well, well.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.849
If it isn't my brother and sister with
their favorite person in the world,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.184
my tutor, Tutor.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.619
Max, are you angry about something?

19:15.653 --> 19:19.356
Yes, I am. Let me tell you
what that something is.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.558
Your new best friend and boyfriend

19:21.592 --> 19:23.493
messed me up on purpose so
that I would fail the test

19:23.527 --> 19:24.727
and you wouldn't have to leave.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.969
Max, Max, Max, listen to yourself.

19:34.003 --> 19:35.637
Your loving brother and sister

19:35.772 --> 19:38.173
conspiring against you
and your wizard training

19:38.207 --> 19:41.143
just for their own selfish reasons?

19:41.177 --> 19:44.446
Doesn't that sound ridiculous?

19:46.883 --> 19:50.552
Well, yeah, I guess it does.

19:51.821 --> 19:53.788
I'm sorry I accused you guys.

19:57.226 --> 19:59.794
We did it!

19:59.828 --> 20:01.662
What are you doing? I had it sold!

20:01.963 --> 20:04.599
Living with that lie was giving
me stress-related symptoms.

20:04.633 --> 20:08.770
OK, I can't believe it.
You back-stabbed your little brother?

20:08.804 --> 20:12.907
Alex and I were blinded.
We wanted her all to ourselves.

20:14.442 --> 20:16.543
We're sorry. Would you forgive us?

20:19.213 --> 20:22.582
OK, but I've got to
get back at you first

20:22.616 --> 20:24.217
'cause I kind of promised Mom.

20:25.519 --> 20:26.887
What?

20:26.921 --> 20:31.324
Yeah. And I think I'll use
something Tutor taught me.

20:34.161 --> 20:36.630
When in doubt, inside out.

20:38.299 --> 20:40.834
Blarney, I'm out! Thank you, lad.

20:40.868 --> 20:44.138
Now, I can turn me wrath
on that evil lass.

20:44.172 --> 20:47.308
Uh, how about those
spuds you wanted?

20:47.342 --> 20:48.909
In fact, you can have them all.

20:49.077 --> 20:51.812
Nah. Me thinks I'll
bite something else.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.385
You!

21:08.728 --> 21:12.931
Ooh! Ouch! Ouch.
OK, easy. Sensitive.

21:12.966 --> 21:14.433
I hate leprechauns.

21:14.467 --> 21:17.035
And I hate what you
guys did to Max.

21:17.070 --> 21:19.471
He has a lot of talent
but he can't focus it

21:19.506 --> 21:22.274
because of all the
dysfunction in this family.

21:22.308 --> 21:24.109
What do you mean?

21:24.143 --> 21:26.912
We're not that dysfunctional.

21:28.681 --> 21:30.348
Oh, no?

21:30.382 --> 21:33.017
OK, you sabotaged
your little brother

21:33.051 --> 21:35.418
and then your mother told
him to get back at you.

21:35.653 --> 21:38.889
In all my years of tutoring I have
never seen anything like this.

21:40.025 --> 21:42.560
Well, then I, uh...

21:42.594 --> 21:44.763
...I guess this is goodbye.

21:44.797 --> 21:48.833
I just feel like I'm gonna
miss you. - Me, too.

21:48.867 --> 21:51.234
Of course you are. I'm part elf.

21:52.169 --> 21:53.135
You are?

21:53.170 --> 21:55.270
Yeah. I thought you knew that.
