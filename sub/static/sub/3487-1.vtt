00:40.796 --> 00:45.420
I think again because of the brutality
of the killing here, the circumstances...

00:45.452 --> 00:46.263
Out top story tonight.

00:46.289 --> 00:48.731
A salvage murder in the 4th parish
has brought the locals there..

00:48.756 --> 00:52.950
Shaping up as one of the most
disturbing story of 1988 so far.

00:52.985 --> 00:57.845
Martha Livingston allegedly killed four
of her friends before hanging herself...

00:57.890 --> 01:00.354
in what the authorities are calling
a ritualistic murder...

01:00.393 --> 01:06.682
a cult related case. It's the biggest
thing that happens since Lizzie Borden

01:07.301 --> 01:11.654
5 young people killed as part of a
bizarre satanic ritual...

01:13.037 --> 01:18.319
WFAL7 Jean Stanton, is live at
Lawford parish with that story...

01:18.543 --> 01:21.002
Neighbors said they are puzzled
that someone they described

01:21.028 --> 01:23.503
as quiet and who kept to herself
could be capable of the...

01:23.538 --> 01:25.178
Those around this area
surely remembered the

01:25.204 --> 01:26.817
Martha Livingston murders
that shocked all..

01:26.842 --> 01:29.414
More than twenty years after the
Livingston murders, some...

01:29.439 --> 01:34.472
residence maintained paranormal phenomena
played a role in those murders..

01:35.007 --> 01:39.499
It's Grace's first time using a medium
to cleanse a house of negative energy...

01:39.524 --> 01:41.513
but she is willing to try anyway...

01:41.539 --> 01:44.089
- It's interesting because
we'll do an open house and...

01:44.090 --> 01:47.626
people would walk in and like:
"Who lived here and why did they moved"

01:47.651 --> 01:49.309
- Did somebody die in here?
- .. Someone says

01:49.334 --> 01:53.814
that ghosts are nothing more than lost
souls who were stuck in their sorrows...

01:53.859 --> 01:57.240
But whatever you believe about
the afterlife, it's undeniable

01:57.265 --> 02:01.525
that something horrific happened
in this house all those years ago...

02:28.622 --> 02:30.503
I'll be there.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.395
I said I'll be there.

02:35.542 --> 02:38.088
Why am I in a bad mood?

02:38.543 --> 02:43.340
Uh... Deb heard noises next door,
wanted me to check it out.

02:43.365 --> 02:44.740
Yeah.

02:45.322 --> 02:47.364
Livingston House.

02:47.813 --> 02:51.607
No, it's completely quiet.

03:00.797 --> 03:02.811
I'll call you back.

03:50.755 --> 03:53.510
This is probably a stupid question,
but this is the best you got?

03:53.535 --> 03:57.310
- Very stupid question.
- Huh, ha, ha, ha. I'll take it.

03:58.265 --> 03:58.867
Hello.

03:58.893 --> 04:01.280
Hi Detective. Sorry to
bother you but I got a call

04:01.305 --> 04:04.377
about a disturbance from the 4 LaForte Road
out by the section of the swarm.

04:04.402 --> 04:07.476
We need immediately assistance and
my closest officer is 20 minutes out.

04:07.501 --> 04:09.956
Uh no. That's alright Margery,
I'm 2 minutes away I'll take it.

04:09.981 --> 04:12.361
Sorry, to bother you.
I know you had a date tonight.

04:12.396 --> 04:16.012
If only the bad guys respected
my social calendar.

05:08.417 --> 05:09.516
Halt!

05:09.541 --> 05:12.683
Goddamn it, Leonard.
You scared the shit out of me.

05:12.718 --> 05:14.742
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:14.790 --> 05:18.956
- What the hell is going on?
- There's blood in there.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.921
- Stay here. Do not move.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.923
Police!

05:32.314 --> 05:34.092
Police.

06:11.713 --> 06:17.840
This is detective Lewis. Requesting backup
and EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

06:17.865 --> 06:22.203
I repeat. I need backup and
EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

06:22.228 --> 06:23.767
Copy that.

06:56.392 --> 06:58.509
Police!

08:30.862 --> 08:32.376
Margery, where...

08:34.917 --> 08:39.190
Police! Hold it boy.
Stop. I said stop.

08:39.215 --> 08:40.981
Stop...!

08:43.677 --> 08:46.455
Stay down.
Stay down.

08:48.411 --> 08:50.119
Alright.
Alright, alright.

08:50.144 --> 08:52.085
You okay?

08:52.111 --> 08:55.382
Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me. You okay?

08:55.407 --> 08:57.783
Alright.
You're okay.

08:57.808 --> 09:00.288
You're okay...

09:02.537 --> 09:05.810
ONE WEEK EARLIER

09:05.835 --> 09:08.251
Are you okay?

09:08.276 --> 09:09.763
John?

09:10.827 --> 09:12.234
John?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.067
Are you okay?

09:18.356 --> 09:20.768
Are you gonna answer my brother?

09:21.556 --> 09:24.575
Yeah. Sorry man,
what was the question?

09:25.562 --> 09:28.010
You were talking about
what you saw in the house.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.132
You said you were
having visions of her.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.439
I just want to clarify who the 'her' was.

09:34.472 --> 09:37.212
Was it one of the victims, or uh..

09:37.237 --> 09:39.268
- ...the owner of the house?
- No.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.765
No, it was my mum.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.853
She died a few years ago,
and uh...

09:51.313 --> 09:57.709
I don't know. I just keep...
seeing her in this house...

09:57.734 --> 10:00.088
but I've never been inside of it before.

10:00.914 --> 10:04.451
She's... sitting there.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.680
Smiling.

10:08.978 --> 10:11.448
Telling me to let go.

10:11.984 --> 10:15.987
She is younger than I remembered her.
She's closer to my age.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.508
And you've always had these visions?

10:18.644 --> 10:22.050
No, only just started a few months ago.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.781
This is a...
This is really great stuff.

10:25.806 --> 10:28.092
Bryan's going to love this.

10:28.615 --> 10:30.091
Bryan?

10:30.518 --> 10:32.625
Yeah, Bryan Purcell.

10:36.976 --> 10:39.104
Hey. Hey, please don't
walk away from this.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.424
I feel like we are
actually getting somewhere.

10:41.449 --> 10:43.114
Why didn't you tell me
that Bryan was involved?

10:43.140 --> 10:44.500
Because I didn't
think it mattered.

10:44.535 --> 10:47.078
You didn't think that it matter that
your ex-boyfriend was coming along?

10:47.104 --> 10:49.063
It's was three years ago.

10:49.542 --> 10:54.998
Look. I was going to tell you, but I needed
to know if you would come first.

10:56.067 --> 10:59.600
Hey, look. Sam, I appreciate what
you're trying to do man, but I uh...

10:59.635 --> 11:02.081
I don't this stuff to
cure my nightmares okay.

11:02.108 --> 11:02.693
Okay.

11:02.718 --> 11:06.675
But visions like this aren't just going to
go away unless we really hit them head on.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.956
- What does that mean head on?
- It means we go to the house.

11:09.991 --> 11:11.786
Once inside of it, we'll
evaluate your connection.

11:11.811 --> 11:15.346
See if these visions have any sense of
realistic within the structure itself.

11:15.371 --> 11:16.748
Yeah.
Bryan?

11:16.783 --> 11:20.693
Bryan, Jules and Donnie would be there
to evaluate the paranormal aspects..

11:20.728 --> 11:23.315
They believe that where there were victims,
there are spirits.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.457
No.

11:24.482 --> 11:26.513
Bryan does not care
about victims, or

11:26.539 --> 11:28.918
spirits, or anything
going on with me, okay.

11:28.963 --> 11:32.732
He is an opportunist who only
cares about capturing ghost on tape,

11:32.757 --> 11:34.379
so that he can make as
much money out of it as he can.

11:34.404 --> 11:38.063
Which is why he is going to insist,
we go with or without you.

11:38.088 --> 11:43.133
Look. A lot of unexplained things happened
in that house all those years ago.

11:43.178 --> 11:46.803
I think that when your mother heard
about it, it stucked with her.

11:46.828 --> 11:50.181
I think those things haunted her.
Like they are haunting you.

11:50.464 --> 11:52.852
But hey. Don't listen to me to me.

11:52.877 --> 11:56.458
It's your mom.
She's the one telling you to let go.

12:01.681 --> 12:03.848
You haven't slept in weeks.

12:04.659 --> 12:06.995
I understand your skepticism,

12:07.139 --> 12:10.104
and this might not work.
But what if it does?

12:12.128 --> 12:14.469
Just try it.

12:14.761 --> 12:16.522
Please.

12:16.626 --> 12:20.277
Her name is Michelle Chapman.
We think she's the suspect's girlfriend.

12:20.310 --> 12:22.533
No sign of her yet but we
did find her purse inside.

12:22.558 --> 12:24.863
Let me try to pull the
prints from the murder weapon.

12:24.889 --> 12:25.465
Alright.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.475
Don't hang around on my account.
Go find some prints.

12:27.501 --> 12:27.969
Yes sir.

12:27.994 --> 12:29.705
Here, here, here...

12:36.394 --> 12:39.623
- How many are there?
- So far 13 cameras.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.391
Almost the entire house is covered,
but we're not seeing anything.

12:42.426 --> 12:45.517
- God damn it. Erased?
- No. Scrambled. Dead air.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.473
There's recorded information but...

12:47.498 --> 12:49.460
We got a mass murderer
from that many angles, and

12:49.486 --> 12:51.382
you are telling me we don't
have a single thing?

12:51.393 --> 12:52.900
I have a good
feeling about this.

12:52.926 --> 12:55.029
Henry, what are you
doing with the freezer?

12:55.054 --> 12:57.323
Sometimes freezing the drives
helps the data recovery.

12:57.349 --> 12:57.890
Henry...

12:57.915 --> 12:59.704
there's going to be more murders
if you screw up those drives.

12:59.729 --> 13:01.135
I'm telling you right now.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.654
Look. We'll bagged it.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.649
And we'll try to defragment the data files
and see if we can recovery anything but...

13:05.697 --> 13:09.189
6 drives, 2 terabytes full of raw data
could take sometime.

13:13.269 --> 13:16.179
- Hey, Percy.
- Hey, Percy.

13:27.627 --> 13:30.727
- His rights been read?
- Yes sir. Reeves got it.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.382
How are you doing, John?

13:45.791 --> 13:49.124
- Have you found Michelle yet?
- Not yet, so...

13:49.149 --> 13:51.527
Hoping you could help us with that.

13:51.552 --> 13:55.918
- He took her. He took her away.
- Who took her?

13:56.101 --> 13:59.202
I got to go find her.
'Cos he couldn't have gone far.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.512
How many of you were there, John. 6?
Were there 6 of you?

14:02.537 --> 14:04.583
Are you listening to me?

14:04.771 --> 14:07.970
You got to get out there and...
find her.

14:08.002 --> 14:11.169
We're looking for Michelle right now.
I promise you that.

14:11.256 --> 14:16.377
But what I need from you right now is...
tell me who is missing?

14:16.535 --> 14:20.276
John, look at these photos right here.
And tell me who is missing?

14:25.225 --> 14:28.449
- Bryan Purcell.
- Bryan Purcell.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.582
- When's the last time you saw Bryan?
- I don't know.

14:35.607 --> 14:39.006
You don't know? You said he took her.
Where did he take her?

14:39.038 --> 14:40.486
- I don't know.
- Where?

14:40.511 --> 14:42.173
It happened so fast.
I don't know.

14:42.199 --> 14:44.404
Did Bryan Purcell kill
these people, here?

14:44.429 --> 14:46.665
Did he kill your friends?

14:48.075 --> 14:49.345
No?

14:49.385 --> 14:51.654
It was the house.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.124
It was the house.

14:54.149 --> 14:58.102
The house did...
did something to him.

14:58.127 --> 15:00.511
"The house did something to him."

15:01.726 --> 15:04.996
If that could hold up in the court
of the law, John. You know...

15:05.044 --> 15:08.360
Usually convicted houses
in the state Louisiana.

15:08.585 --> 15:10.821
This house is different.

15:10.853 --> 15:12.823
What were you doing
in the house, John?

15:12.848 --> 15:15.541
They woke it up.
They...

15:15.581 --> 15:19.239
They try to contact to the other side
and they woke it up.

15:19.264 --> 15:22.123
They woke it up.
They woke up the house.

15:22.164 --> 15:24.420
I only did it for Michelle.

15:24.499 --> 15:27.697
It's my fault. Please be alive.
- John...

15:27.722 --> 15:29.024
Please be alive.

15:29.049 --> 15:31.325
Listen to me John.
I need you to stay calm, okay.

15:31.350 --> 15:35.812
If it was Bryan. You have to find him.
Before he hurts Michelle.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.506
Okay.
You have to find him!

15:37.531 --> 15:41.276
- We will.
- Please... Please...

15:42.020 --> 15:44.950
Please.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.430
Detective. No prints on the axe.
Wiped clean.

15:53.455 --> 15:55.679
There can't be any prints
on the axe, Jenkins.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.531
The house did it.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.756
Sir?

15:57.789 --> 16:00.233
- Never mind.
- You want me to bring him to the station?

16:00.258 --> 16:02.405
Uh..no. I want you to keep him here.

16:02.430 --> 16:05.363
We got two people out there,
could be victims, could be killers.

16:05.395 --> 16:07.414
Right now this guy is my only shoot
at putting this thing together

16:07.439 --> 16:09.811
- So I want him close to me, yeah.
- Yes sir.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.747
- Keep him here... Okay.
- Yes sir.

16:12.985 --> 16:15.982
Dispatch.
That's a negative on the transport.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.183
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:36.208 --> 16:39.983
- It's... it's me. You busy?
- Yeah, I'm busy being stood up.

16:40.025 --> 16:43.625
- I'm sorry about that, something came up.
- Two hours I've been waiting, Lewis.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.196
If you could just let me
get a word in.

16:45.221 --> 16:48.304
I got a triple homicide here
in the Livingston house.

16:50.288 --> 16:51.693
What?

16:52.367 --> 16:55.337
- Martha Livingston?
- Yeah.

16:55.539 --> 16:57.317
Do you have someone in custody?

16:57.342 --> 16:59.554
I do. I do. But uh...
he's in shock right now.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.107
Says he can't remembers anything

17:01.132 --> 17:04.623
Plus I got 2 people who are missing,
the entire force is looking for.

17:04.647 --> 17:08.896
- Oh. Copycat crime maybe.
- No, no... no maybe.

17:08.935 --> 17:12.285
- Kid saying they woke the house up.
- Huh.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.226
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

17:14.251 --> 17:16.292
Alright good, it's a date.

17:16.339 --> 17:20.038
No, no. It was suppose to be a date.
It's definitely not a date.

17:22.704 --> 17:24.981
- Reeves.
- Yes sir.

17:25.006 --> 17:27.739
Get everything you can on
the Livingston case, okay.

17:27.763 --> 17:29.385
Yes, yes sir.

17:34.939 --> 17:39.879
Hello... it's Jules here.
I'm in the car... waiting. So bored.

17:39.904 --> 17:42.465
- Bryan, say something.
- Uh. (Car horn)

17:44.173 --> 17:47.210
Where are they?

17:47.235 --> 17:49.072
Speak of the devil.

17:49.586 --> 17:52.277
Let's go, you lovebirds.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.813
Hey.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.446
Donnie.

17:58.727 --> 17:59.861
Donnie.

18:00.290 --> 18:04.491
You didn't speak with real people today.
You okay with that?

18:04.947 --> 18:08.561
- Don't waste the batteries, Jules.
- Give me the camera.

18:10.162 --> 18:13.236
- Hey guys.
- Jules.

18:13.721 --> 18:16.422
Good morning, Michelle.
Good morning John.

18:16.448 --> 18:17.097
Hi.

18:17.123 --> 18:22.132
You guys are perfect for each other.
Matching haircuts and everything.

18:22.157 --> 18:24.160
Oh... your's looks like a wet dog.

18:24.226 --> 18:28.625
Truth. - You're the third John Michelle
dated since she's been with me. So...

18:28.772 --> 18:31.618
Truth.- It's so clear that
you're not over Michelle,

18:31.644 --> 18:33.927
and it's really
embarrassing for you, man.

18:33.952 --> 18:35.623
Nice bangs (hair).

18:35.648 --> 18:39.537
Hey. Even though you're not the first,
but definitely the most interesting.

18:39.562 --> 18:42.090
A honest to god, a haunted house
in the mounts of Louisiana?

18:42.116 --> 18:43.239
It's not a haunted house, Bryan.

18:43.264 --> 18:45.620
- Let's go find out.
- Bryan. Lay off.

18:46.643 --> 18:50.483
- Hey. Your eyes look great on film.
- Those aren't my eyes, Bryan.

18:53.692 --> 18:57.631
That's something.
Anything from inside the house?

18:57.691 --> 18:59.673
Nothing yet.
Still working on it.

18:59.698 --> 19:02.162
Jenkins, where're we at on the
background for the Purcell kid?

19:02.187 --> 19:03.524
Should have it any minute.

19:03.572 --> 19:06.743
- Detective Klein just landed.
She's walking up.

19:06.768 --> 19:08.620
Good, good, good, good.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.649
Hey.

19:11.809 --> 19:14.279
Good excuse to miss date night.

19:14.407 --> 19:17.058
- Ha. It's called a phone call.
- I know.

19:17.118 --> 19:19.637
I mean, assuming you can get this
guy to make some sense.

19:19.662 --> 19:22.744
Because right now he's just mumbling
about how the house did it.

19:22.804 --> 19:24.177
I'm sure you are very
understanding about that.

19:24.203 --> 19:25.920
Seeing how I don't even like
when you read my horoscope.

19:25.945 --> 19:28.715
No, I'm not interested in talking about
the house is a murder suspect.

19:28.740 --> 19:30.662
- So, where is he?
- What? Wait.

19:30.687 --> 19:33.761
When this is all over.
I still got a bottle of wine in my car.

19:33.928 --> 19:36.113
I tell you what. I'll
share that wine with you,

19:36.139 --> 19:38.252
if you let me read your horoscope.
How's that?

19:38.277 --> 19:40.155
- Not a chance.
- Hm.

19:45.674 --> 19:46.958
Klein.

19:47.041 --> 19:48.366
Henry.

19:49.643 --> 19:52.145
John.
This is Dr. Elizabeth Klein.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.969
She's the department psychologist.

19:55.675 --> 19:58.482
Hello, John.
I'm Elizabeth.

19:58.507 --> 20:00.097
How're you doing, huh?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.736
I'm going to let you two talk.

20:02.761 --> 20:05.164
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

20:06.253 --> 20:07.531
Hey.

20:09.271 --> 20:11.063
You might be in a
little bit of shock.

20:11.088 --> 20:14.415
- Henry, can you get me the blanket please.
- Of course.

20:16.582 --> 20:21.432
After a traumatic experience like this,
most people shut down.

20:21.718 --> 20:23.750
So you are not alone.

20:24.006 --> 20:28.603
But the thing that gets most people moving
is to have a strong purpose

20:28.628 --> 20:32.255
Let me show you that purpose.
Can you do that John?

20:34.847 --> 20:36.878
Can you?

20:41.263 --> 20:44.619
I never should have told her
about this place.

20:47.095 --> 20:50.547
Who shouldn't you have told that?
Michelle?

20:51.264 --> 20:52.374
She...

20:53.110 --> 20:56.248
She used to...
hang out with them.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.902
Before I met her.

21:00.462 --> 21:03.664
'Hunting ghosts',
they called it.

21:04.153 --> 21:06.717
Is that what they were here for?

21:10.041 --> 21:14.186
Hey, the police said you blacked out.
It's probably from the shock.

21:14.486 --> 21:18.176
Is there anything at all that you
can tell me, that you remember?

21:19.030 --> 21:22.992
I can remember some stuff
from earlier today.

21:23.884 --> 21:26.294
Why don't you walk me
through what you remember.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.285
Maybe it'll help to
bring something up.

21:29.533 --> 21:31.613
I can try.

21:36.544 --> 21:39.189
Alright.
A little introduction here.

21:39.214 --> 21:44.939
Samuel B. Chapman. Looking very serious
and smart with his energy drink.

21:44.998 --> 21:48.831
Jules Carter, our occult specialist /
research guru.

21:48.856 --> 21:51.566
- I'm also a sexy bitch.
- That you are.

21:51.591 --> 21:56.869
Donald Smith, technological connoisseur
and resident mouth breather.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.486
Alright.
Alright...

21:58.511 --> 22:01.364
Do it.
Go...

22:01.984 --> 22:05.789
- Go. Put your meat in his mouth.
- He's taking it.

22:05.870 --> 22:07.191
I'm waiting.

22:10.122 --> 22:12.946
Damn redneck, hillbillies.

22:22.110 --> 22:25.249
So tell us what's been happening with you.

22:25.493 --> 22:26.989
Uh well...

22:27.024 --> 22:31.880
The house that we're going to is in a
small town where my mom grew up.

22:31.905 --> 22:37.185
And... about 25 years ago,
there was an incident.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.736
I think they called it mass murder.

22:39.777 --> 22:43.414
Yeah.
The Martha Livingston murders.

22:43.439 --> 22:45.627
But no one lived in the house since.

22:45.652 --> 22:47.190
How you know the house?

22:47.222 --> 22:51.271
Growing up, my mom was kind of
friends with Martha Livingston.

22:51.296 --> 22:55.058
The girl who lived there
and, who... you know..

22:55.083 --> 22:57.004
Did she ever talked to you
about the murders?

22:57.029 --> 23:02.326
No, no. No one talk about it. I think
the whole town just want it to go away.

23:02.351 --> 23:05.238
You don't think this is real, do you?

23:05.263 --> 23:06.434
No.

23:06.459 --> 23:08.894
I think we actually do the things
that we can say we can do, right?

23:08.934 --> 23:10.115
Bryan, easy up man. This
is just an interview.

23:10.141 --> 23:10.667
Shut the hell up.

23:10.692 --> 23:13.460
I just want to know why this guy
always acts he's too cool for all of us.

23:13.485 --> 23:15.239
Not all of you, Bryan.

23:15.264 --> 23:19.475
Fuck. You know what I think. I think
you're actually curious about this house.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.080
You think there's some kind of connection
that you can't fully explain.

23:22.106 --> 23:24.058
You don't believe any
of this, of course.

23:24.084 --> 23:26.430
Because we're all full of shit.
And here you are.

23:26.465 --> 23:28.094
So why don't you admit
that deep down you

23:28.121 --> 23:29.840
hope that we can make
sense of this for you.

23:29.865 --> 23:31.274
Bryan, stop.

23:31.299 --> 23:33.905
You don't have to come here with us.
You know that.

23:33.930 --> 23:38.455
They were gonna edit a documentary,
trying to capture spirits on film.

23:38.959 --> 23:44.238
So. Once you got to the house.
Did you manage to capture spirits?

23:48.009 --> 23:50.270
Oh.
Alright.

23:50.348 --> 23:53.840
- Watch the mud.
- Yeah. Watch your shoes.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.430
What are those?

23:58.465 --> 24:00.838
I think they're Abilene chimes.

24:01.876 --> 24:04.493
- Suppose to beckon the dead.
- There's more.

24:04.518 --> 24:06.052
Holy shit.

24:06.990 --> 24:11.066
- Am I crazy? I don't feel any wind.
- It's acting weird.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.401
Aw...!

24:16.978 --> 24:18.820
- What. Are you okay?
- Aw.

24:19.518 --> 24:20.654
- What happened?
- Aw...

24:20.679 --> 24:23.294
You guys...
are so gullible.

24:23.319 --> 24:26.851
- Oh... my god.
- Ha, ha, ha. You make funny jokes.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.711
What?
No?

24:29.736 --> 24:30.923
Come on.

24:30.948 --> 24:32.966
- You like it.
- No.

24:32.991 --> 24:35.052
- Tough crowd.
- Let's go.

24:41.903 --> 24:43.983
Donnie, catch up.

25:10.215 --> 25:12.122
Is this real?

25:13.857 --> 25:15.820
Ah...
Jesus.

25:17.354 --> 25:19.701
At least this house
isn't open to visitors.

25:19.727 --> 25:20.874
Why you say that?

25:20.899 --> 25:23.451
That gas lamp dates back to 1800s.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.201
Used to use as a few
passing by on the road

25:25.227 --> 25:27.001
could see if the master
of the house is home.

25:27.033 --> 25:29.751
It was open for guest, when
it was lit, meant it was.

25:29.777 --> 25:31.512
I promise we'll be good guest.

25:31.552 --> 25:34.178
Let's uh... be up and running in an hour.
Yeah.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.101
Thing is going to take
sometime, I don't really

25:36.127 --> 25:37.801
want to stay here
longer than we have to.

25:37.826 --> 25:41.213
- What thing?
- It's an evocation. It's like a seance.

25:41.238 --> 25:44.371
We try to summon the spirits to see if you
could get the victims to communicate.

25:44.396 --> 25:47.467
What if we summon Martha
Livingston instead?

25:47.492 --> 25:49.200
We won't, because among
other precautions.

25:49.226 --> 25:51.265
We're only going to use
good energies to summon. r

25:51.297 --> 25:52.157
Good energy.

25:52.182 --> 25:53.787
- Yeah.
- Alright.

25:53.812 --> 25:56.154
So let me see if I have this straight?

25:56.179 --> 26:00.208
You guys came to the house to do a seance
to communicate with the dead.

26:00.233 --> 26:03.878
And it's so happens that
Martha Livingston and her

26:03.904 --> 26:07.835
friends also did a seance in
this house 2 decades ago.

26:09.202 --> 26:11.383
Do you see what I'm getting at?

26:17.479 --> 26:22.343
It seems that someone intended to repeat
the murders in exactly the same way.

26:22.368 --> 26:24.236
That happened 20 years ago.

26:30.375 --> 26:35.385
I don't know if it's Bryan Purcell,
or someone else or you.

26:35.545 --> 26:41.266
But the truth is if we don't to the bottom of this,
you are looking at spending the rest of your life in prison.

26:42.618 --> 26:47.348
And I've to tell you when that happens, I'm
not going to be able to help you anymore.

26:47.373 --> 26:51.027
I just... I just...
I want to remember.

26:52.012 --> 26:55.697
All I care about is that
they find Michelle.

26:55.827 --> 26:58.807
And...
And that she's alive.

27:00.189 --> 27:03.788
So tell me.
How did you get inside the house?

27:27.238 --> 27:30.358
- Oh my god, this place is awesome.
- Alright.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.684
Shut off your phones,
so I can read the house.

27:41.682 --> 27:43.306
- John, are you okay?
- Why?

27:43.331 --> 27:44.734
- You're bleeding.
- What?

27:44.759 --> 27:46.202
Your nose is bleeding.

27:48.898 --> 27:53.258
- Does that happened to you a lot?
- Uh, no. No, never.

27:53.283 --> 27:55.219
He gets sensitive to
change in pressure.

27:55.245 --> 27:57.768
I'd see that happens before
when spirits are around.

27:57.793 --> 28:00.993
Congratulations.
Popped your cherry.

28:01.481 --> 28:03.338
It's a good sign.

28:10.009 --> 28:12.037
Alright, let's get audio
and video up.

28:12.069 --> 28:16.363
Donnie set up the batteries and don't
be afraid to tell people what you need.

28:16.388 --> 28:19.578
It doesn't sounds good If things happened,
we don't get it on camera.

28:21.389 --> 28:25.152
Why did Sam Chapman think you had
such a connection to the house?

28:25.527 --> 28:27.761
So your mother knew Martha and
the victims, but so what.

28:27.787 --> 28:29.172
What does that have
to do with you?

28:29.184 --> 28:31.272
I'm trying to understand that.

28:32.647 --> 28:34.309
My mother...

28:36.734 --> 28:39.735
She was inside the house,
the night of the murders.

28:40.087 --> 28:42.725
You mean Sara Matthews?

28:42.878 --> 28:45.324
The one who escaped.
That was your mother?

28:45.535 --> 28:47.285
I didn't tell the crew...

28:47.995 --> 28:49.429
or Michelle.
But...

28:49.454 --> 28:51.544
Looking back.
I... I should have.

28:51.569 --> 28:56.407
John, hon. This is not going to look good
in a court of law. You know that, right?

28:56.497 --> 28:59.427
All I can do...
is just tell the truth.

28:59.452 --> 29:01.004
It's all I can do.

29:01.209 --> 29:03.901
And the truth is
you have visions.

29:03.926 --> 29:05.266
Yes.

29:05.701 --> 29:09.102
Of my mom in the house.

29:11.168 --> 29:13.951
Tell me that I...
I need to let go.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.484
Yo. Here's your walkie.

29:22.509 --> 29:23.744
Thanks.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.139
This must be the infamous
Martha Livingston.

29:28.165 --> 29:28.732
Yeah.

29:28.757 --> 29:30.564
She's kind of hot.

29:30.762 --> 29:33.236
- I would do her.
- Me too.

29:34.404 --> 29:36.750
You know any of those birds?

29:36.775 --> 29:41.279
It's a grackle. It's an important symbol
to the people of the occult.

29:41.583 --> 29:46.277
Said it was used as a messenger in the old
world between the devil and his followers.

29:46.302 --> 29:47.852
Oh shit.

29:48.517 --> 29:52.422
- You got to be careful.
- Don't tell Bryan.

29:53.121 --> 29:54.827
I'm going to tell him.

29:55.558 --> 29:57.981
- It was an accident.
- I have to tell him.

29:58.287 --> 30:00.640
You leave me no choice.

30:06.348 --> 30:09.404
Okay dude. I think this is going to be
the best room for evocation.

30:09.429 --> 30:11.882
It's got like the highest reading.

30:15.892 --> 30:17.584
No way.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.995
What...
Camera Glasses?

30:23.130 --> 30:24.673
What did I say?

30:25.316 --> 30:28.905
- Don't touch anything.
- Chill there, Bryan.

30:58.337 --> 31:00.355
Attic's clear.

31:25.637 --> 31:28.550
I'm not getting a feed from your camera.

31:29.806 --> 31:32.446
Okay, copy that.

31:45.049 --> 31:48.720
Uh... it's almost.
Yeah, that did it.

31:48.745 --> 31:49.990
You got it.

31:52.662 --> 31:56.856
I... want to put a baby in you.

32:16.469 --> 32:18.378
Anyone here?

32:50.543 --> 32:52.630
My name is Sam Chapman.

32:53.465 --> 32:57.879
We're trapped inside the house.
He's gone... crazy.

32:59.246 --> 33:00.990
He's got an axe.

33:01.395 --> 33:03.400
He's gone crazy.
He is killing everyone.

33:03.425 --> 33:05.467
I don't know what to do?

33:08.212 --> 33:10.154
I just want to go home.

33:10.233 --> 33:11.475
I just want to go home.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.729
Aw...!

33:24.317 --> 33:25.820
Oh my god...

33:25.845 --> 33:28.188
How did you retrieve these files.
How did you do this?

33:28.776 --> 33:30.422
The uh..
The frozen hard drives sir.

33:30.446 --> 33:33.623
Okay, get another freezer down here. I want
you to freeze all these hard drives. Now!

33:33.648 --> 33:35.056
- Okay.
- Yes sir.

33:35.695 --> 33:40.119
Just try, if you can.
There must be something else.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.600
Dr. Klein.

33:41.885 --> 33:44.070
Excuse me for a second, John.

33:47.516 --> 33:50.437
- How's it going?
- You are not going to believe this.

33:50.497 --> 33:53.971
- Sara Matthews was his mother.
- Who is that?

33:54.176 --> 33:58.373
The lone survivor. The one who escaped
before Martha could murder her.

33:58.398 --> 34:00.108
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

34:00.133 --> 34:03.261
Jesus Christ. The more I learned
about this kid, the less I trust him.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.949
Alright. Tell him we going through
the footage, we can't get anything.

34:06.976 --> 34:09.108
- Go at him with that. See how he reacts.
- Okay, I will.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.404
Also get the guys to
look for some interview

34:11.429 --> 34:13.876
tapes from Sara Matthews
soon after the murders.

34:13.900 --> 34:14.895
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.283
I'm going back in.
I think we're get somewhere. - (Alright)

34:17.971 --> 34:19.726
Hey.
John.

34:21.230 --> 34:23.859
This is strange but um...

34:24.547 --> 34:27.565
They can't get any footage
from inside the house.

34:28.304 --> 34:29.650
I don't understand.

34:29.675 --> 34:32.638
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house.

34:32.663 --> 34:35.101
And then, there's no documentation.

34:35.127 --> 34:37.402
Nothing to show what happened
in that house.

34:37.427 --> 34:38.813
Can you explain that?

34:38.838 --> 34:40.425
I don't know.

34:40.449 --> 34:43.726
That's my point.
I can't explain it.

34:45.237 --> 34:47.918
I just told you what happened.

34:51.469 --> 34:53.422
Can I just have a little more light?

34:53.455 --> 34:54.576
Oh yeah.

34:54.603 --> 34:57.881
Sorry, I don't want to
get the wrong angles on those ghosts.

34:57.906 --> 35:01.191
- Yeah, that's right.
- Very picky. Diva ghost.

35:01.937 --> 35:04.380
Everything we can do
to get them out, alright.

35:04.463 --> 35:05.264
Wait a second.

35:05.289 --> 35:08.030
Can you check this camera.
See there might be something...

35:08.055 --> 35:09.488
It's tilting down or something.
I don't know.

35:09.513 --> 35:11.417
Oh yeah? Is that one
totally broken?

35:11.442 --> 35:12.966
I don't know. There's something wrong.
It just keeps...

35:12.991 --> 35:13.979
I don't know what that is.

35:14.004 --> 35:16.188
That's the reason? It's a broken camera?
- I don't want to check it.

35:16.213 --> 35:18.528
It's so broken huh.
That what you want me to fix.

35:18.553 --> 35:20.408
You really know what, exactly.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.891
- Are you messing with me?
- No, I didn't.

35:25.230 --> 35:26.742
That wasn't you?

35:26.767 --> 35:27.790
No.

35:29.685 --> 35:31.650
I am surprised this is happening.

35:31.675 --> 35:34.026
Hey Jules.
I think this room might actually be...

35:34.827 --> 35:36.471
What the hell was that?

35:37.482 --> 35:40.419
I... don't.
I don't know.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.692
- Something's here.
- Someone is just messing with us.

35:47.097 --> 35:49.222
What happened?
Are you okay?

35:49.247 --> 35:51.067
Did you see that door just closed?

35:51.092 --> 35:52.246
No.

35:53.686 --> 35:56.341
Shit.
I definitely just saw that.

35:56.819 --> 35:59.601
Give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

36:11.896 --> 36:15.815
Come on. You've just
opened the door for us.

36:16.469 --> 36:18.536
Why don't you tell us why you're here.

36:18.771 --> 36:20.956
Why are you slamming doors?

36:20.981 --> 36:22.664
Show yourself.

36:22.731 --> 36:25.615
Someone just touched me.
Somebody just touched my leg.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.693
- Do you see anything in the camera?
- I don't know.

36:27.718 --> 36:29.496
- Something just touched me.
- I can't see anything.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.480
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

36:31.653 --> 36:35.426
Everyone is clean except Bryan Purcell.
Purcell was a stiletto issue.

36:35.451 --> 36:38.085
Got expelled for threatening a
professor during a disagreement

36:38.111 --> 36:39.896
Professor filed a restraining order.

36:39.921 --> 36:42.559
And Chapman says "he" (male) in the tape,
before he gets killed.

36:42.584 --> 36:45.916
Narrows it down to 2.
He also said...

36:46.121 --> 36:48.740
He also said that they
were locked in the house.

36:48.766 --> 36:51.039
But how can you be
locked from the inside.

36:51.064 --> 36:54.357
- We found multiple prints on the doorknob.
- Yeah.

36:54.672 --> 36:55.507
I don't know.

36:55.538 --> 36:58.568
If you're lock inside of a house, Jenkins.
How would you try to escape?

36:58.593 --> 37:00.969
Um...
Try to get out through the window.

37:00.994 --> 37:02.147
Boarded.

37:02.172 --> 37:04.771
Or. What about a laundry chute
or something like that?

37:04.808 --> 37:06.401
No...

37:06.747 --> 37:08.358
Milk chute.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.226
What's a milk chute?

37:12.818 --> 37:16.465
Old houses like these have them
so that milkman could leave the bottles.

37:21.335 --> 37:22.540
Oh...

37:22.999 --> 37:24.760
Jesus Christ.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.373
A little tight to fit through huh.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.836
If only these were the people
we were looking for.

37:28.866 --> 37:33.038
I want a picture of this. And I want a
match on the blood type, right away.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.491
Where is Michelle, John?

37:39.889 --> 37:41.924
- Where's Michelle?
- I don't know.

37:41.949 --> 37:43.107
- Mark.
- You don't know?

37:43.273 --> 37:44.915
What's that?

37:45.497 --> 37:48.090
- What... I don't know.
- You don't know what that is?

37:48.116 --> 37:51.715
I think she escaped through that milk slot
and I think you were chasing her, boy.

37:51.740 --> 37:52.855
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:52.891 --> 37:55.294
You don't know what I' talking about or
you can't remember? Which one is it?

37:55.319 --> 37:56.986
- I'm trying to remember.
- You're trying.

37:57.011 --> 37:59.894
Yeah, you try. You know what I thing.
I think you murdered those people.

37:59.934 --> 38:03.313
I think you killed them one by
one just like Martha Livingston.

38:03.338 --> 38:05.636
Only Michelle, she got
away from you didn't she?

38:05.675 --> 38:08.262
Just like your mom got away.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.945
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

38:10.981 --> 38:13.691
I hope Michelle did get away.
I would never do anything to hurt her

38:13.716 --> 38:15.665
- Why's that?
- Because she is pregnant.

38:15.690 --> 38:17.474
She's pregnant?

38:17.499 --> 38:21.132
- She's... she's pregnant.
- She's 10 weeks pregnant.

38:21.157 --> 38:22.671
We weren't telling anyone.

38:22.696 --> 38:25.167
You weren't tell any.
Why didn't you tell me that, John?

38:25.192 --> 38:25.985
I don't know!

38:26.010 --> 38:28.061
Oh, you don't know. You
don't know anything, do you?

38:28.102 --> 38:30.091
You don't know anything.

38:30.438 --> 38:35.330
- I think you killed them, John.
- Mark, can you give us a minute. Please.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.784
Just give us a second, okay.

38:43.428 --> 38:44.809
Hey.

38:44.834 --> 38:47.631
What are you doing?
I was getting somewhere.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.531
You know she was pregnant?

38:49.562 --> 38:52.585
No, but please don't come
back until you're invited.

38:52.611 --> 38:54.411
I really was getting somewhere.

38:54.436 --> 38:56.297
So was I.

38:56.366 --> 38:57.845
Okay.

39:05.523 --> 39:09.892
Okay listen, that's what he thinks.
That's not what I think.

39:09.917 --> 39:13.768
You should have told me was pregnant.
I... I understand why now.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.923
This place is so creepy.

39:40.021 --> 39:41.895
Did you just turned that on?

39:43.751 --> 39:46.526
No, I don't think so.

39:46.724 --> 39:49.044
Uh, hey guys.
The master bedroom.

39:53.369 --> 39:55.257
- What's up?
- What happened?

39:55.288 --> 39:58.010
I just uh.
I picked up this ballerina and...

39:58.035 --> 40:00.070
Come on man. I told you not
to touch anything, right.

40:00.096 --> 40:01.314
Sorry man, I just thought...

40:01.339 --> 40:03.227
Alright. No body asked you to think.
Just don't touch anything.

40:03.252 --> 40:04.920
Bryan. Don't be such an asso.
He didn't know what he is doing.

40:04.957 --> 40:09.158
It doesn't matter if it is a couch,
a ballerina or my ex-girlfriend.

40:09.184 --> 40:11.314
I don't want you
touching things.

40:22.287 --> 40:25.678
- Holy shit.
- Everyone, turn your Walkies off.

40:25.758 --> 40:28.086
He says over the walkie.

40:32.958 --> 40:36.375
- Any other electricity in here besides us?
- No.

40:42.076 --> 40:45.074
- Sam, camera.
- Oh, yeah.

40:46.694 --> 40:50.088
This is where it was before John moved it?
- I agree. - That was it.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.275
Yeah.

40:51.300 --> 40:55.650
So I'm just gonna...
put it back.

41:04.001 --> 41:05.948
Come on.

41:08.994 --> 41:11.408
It's like she's resetting.

41:11.433 --> 41:15.474
No, she's not resetting.
She... She's pointing.

41:15.593 --> 41:17.823
What's she pointing at, John?

41:19.706 --> 41:21.621
The wall?

41:24.323 --> 41:26.383
The rug.

41:27.898 --> 41:29.423
Jules.

41:44.688 --> 41:47.329
Oh.
So much for that.

41:47.760 --> 41:52.626
Wait. What if that is not the rug
where she's pointing at?

41:54.457 --> 41:57.276
- Donnie. Help me.
- Let's go.

42:07.981 --> 42:10.557
- Oh shit.
- Nobody step in it.

42:15.387 --> 42:18.509
- Guys. What is that?
- Donnie, give me your EMF.

42:26.501 --> 42:28.368
It's max out.

42:28.393 --> 42:29.770
What is this?

42:29.795 --> 42:33.189
It's some kind of seal.
But I haven't seen one like this before.

42:33.224 --> 42:35.231
What do you mean.
Aren't you suppose to know all that shit?

42:35.256 --> 42:37.281
Just that, there are thousands
of derivatives of seals.

42:37.307 --> 42:39.632
They all have different meanings
and different variations. So...

42:39.657 --> 42:42.213
I'm sorry if I'm not
familiar with all of them.

42:42.597 --> 42:44.945
We found the source
of the house' energy.

42:44.976 --> 42:47.612
This is obviously where they
performed their rituals.

42:47.681 --> 42:51.245
Which mean.
This is our best spot for communicating.

42:51.479 --> 42:53.889
They may have actually made
contact with the other side.

42:53.914 --> 42:56.693
Yeah, and then Martha went crazy
and killed anyone.

42:56.728 --> 42:59.969
The other side didn't make
Martha do this, okay.

42:59.995 --> 43:02.682
Because nothing had
to make her do this.

43:02.713 --> 43:06.043
She was messed up long before
any of this happened.

43:06.072 --> 43:07.687
My mom used to always say this.

43:07.783 --> 43:11.295
Growing up, she was constantly
getting into trouble, getting into fights.

43:11.326 --> 43:15.302
Nothing to push her over the edge.
Martha was already way over.

43:15.327 --> 43:18.804
Guys.
Is that blood?

43:18.829 --> 43:23.711
- No. It's just wax.
- I see. Now the shit is getting good.

43:23.736 --> 43:26.596
- You ever seen this seal before, John?
- No.

43:26.634 --> 43:32.004
But when the ballerina is pointed at it,
I knew she meant something else.

43:42.650 --> 43:45.924
- Where is it coming from?
- Hold on, hold on.

43:50.537 --> 43:53.678
Donnie, stay close.

43:55.397 --> 43:58.183
- Shit.
- Michelle, you okay?

43:58.287 --> 44:00.006
She's fine.

44:00.845 --> 44:02.929
Where is it coming from?

44:03.953 --> 44:05.671
Jesus.

44:21.892 --> 44:23.925
I got nothing on here.

44:26.047 --> 44:29.404
Careful, careful, careful.
Be careful.

44:58.552 --> 45:01.474
- Jesus Christ.
- What was it?

45:01.499 --> 45:03.481
- Did you see it, see it?
- What was that?

45:03.506 --> 45:05.224
- Did you?
- No!

45:05.324 --> 45:07.317
Oh shit.

45:07.631 --> 45:10.628
- What is that?
- What is it?

45:13.955 --> 45:16.178
- Check it out.
- Shit.

45:16.823 --> 45:19.144
Holy shit.

45:30.530 --> 45:32.687
Holy shit.

45:34.819 --> 45:38.395
The blood on the milk chute,
matches Bryan Purcell's.

45:38.421 --> 45:40.340
It's B+. So he went through.

45:41.374 --> 45:43.991
So he goes through the chute
and he is bloody.

45:44.022 --> 45:47.372
Question is. Did he go through
as a victim or as a killer?

45:47.397 --> 45:50.415
Why would he go through there, if he could
just walked right out the front door?

45:50.440 --> 45:54.459
He's chasing someone, Jenkins.
He's chasing someone, maybe the victim.

45:54.484 --> 45:57.133
So you think Michelle went through it
and Purcell followed it through?

45:57.158 --> 45:58.214
Yeah.

45:58.239 --> 46:00.740
Which means we got to find them 2
before all hell breaks loose.

46:00.765 --> 46:02.127
You go.
Go, go, go.

46:02.152 --> 46:04.601
Copy that.
Reeves, what's your 20?

46:04.626 --> 46:10.043
Let's talk about Bryan Purcell.
You two obviously weren't close.

46:11.063 --> 46:16.154
I've only met him a few times.
He's kind of hard to get along with.

46:16.465 --> 46:18.313
So you didn't like him?

46:18.792 --> 46:23.072
He was just...
obsessed with this house.

46:23.097 --> 46:28.171
And... he tends on taking things too far.
That's what he did.

46:28.627 --> 46:31.368
Come on baby, where are you?

46:36.415 --> 46:38.552
I know you're here.

46:42.242 --> 46:44.462
Where are you?

46:49.593 --> 46:53.892
Okay.
Have it your way.

47:00.486 --> 47:02.780
Show yourself.

47:09.495 --> 47:11.305
Come on.

49:48.566 --> 49:52.489
What's taking so long?
I don't want to be here all night.

49:52.690 --> 49:56.136
Just need another minute.
Got one last thing

50:04.577 --> 50:07.108
- Tha's it, right?
- Yeah.

50:08.638 --> 50:10.660
What is that?

50:10.685 --> 50:13.172
That's an incredibly
sensitive microphone.

50:13.197 --> 50:16.183
It picks up sounds and frequency
that you can't normally hear.

50:16.208 --> 50:20.623
Records 50 different channels.
It's kind of like a human's inner ear.

50:20.913 --> 50:22.757
How does it work?

50:33.652 --> 50:35.534
What is that?

50:39.684 --> 50:41.472
What...?

50:50.721 --> 50:52.923
That's cool.

50:58.141 --> 51:00.114
That's us.

51:00.821 --> 51:03.774
Like our.
Our heartbeats?

51:05.048 --> 51:07.932
That heartbeat... it's...

51:09.061 --> 51:13.143
It's like a fourth faster heartbeat.

51:17.481 --> 51:20.088
That's a fifth one.

51:20.114 --> 51:21.880
Six...

51:24.081 --> 51:26.634
Seven, maybe more.

51:35.616 --> 51:38.186
- What?
- Someone was just in the room with us.

51:38.237 --> 51:40.917
I swear to god.
Someone was standing right there.

51:41.777 --> 51:45.627
- Oh shit! What's happening?
- Donnie, Donnie what've we got?

51:47.281 --> 51:49.720
Oh shit.
Shit, shit.

51:50.649 --> 51:52.560
There's nothing.

52:01.198 --> 52:02.725
John.

52:05.117 --> 52:07.530
What is this?
What the hell just happened?

52:07.565 --> 52:09.688
The painting burst into
flames out of nowhere.

52:09.713 --> 52:13.219
- What do you mean it burst into flames?
- It just burst into flames.

52:14.162 --> 52:16.911
How did you know where the
fire extinguisher was?

52:20.102 --> 52:21.830
I don't know.

52:24.693 --> 52:26.874
Have you seen this room before?

52:30.724 --> 52:36.186
Okay, without looking can you ..
Can you tell me what's behind you?

52:36.211 --> 52:37.985
There's a...

52:38.406 --> 52:43.664
There's a tear in...
the wallpaper, and...

52:44.049 --> 52:49.934
And underneath it is a
drawing of a little girl.

52:52.298 --> 52:54.857
That's weird.

52:56.665 --> 52:58.897
What else?

52:59.683 --> 53:07.431
There is a photograph of
a man in suits and...

53:07.836 --> 53:10.641
And seals behind them.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.163
Holy shit.

53:18.262 --> 53:20.626
There's something else.

53:24.627 --> 53:27.504
There's a woman behind Jules.

53:29.906 --> 53:32.107
Jules...!

53:38.693 --> 53:40.051
Jules?

53:40.663 --> 53:42.859
Jules. Are you okay.
Jules.

53:42.892 --> 53:44.699
- Come on. We got to get her up.
- Alright, we have to leave now.

53:44.724 --> 53:46.446
Do you realize what just happen?
It was crazy.

53:46.471 --> 53:48.753
Oh, you realize it was crazy by her
flying across the room in a shit that far.

53:48.778 --> 53:51.674
I'm saying we should think
about this before we jump ship.

53:51.699 --> 53:54.076
I want to make sure you realize
what we could be sitting on that...

53:54.102 --> 53:56.681
I realized that you are out of your mind
and we're leaving now.

53:56.752 --> 53:58.769
This is what happens
when you make a connection.

53:58.795 --> 54:01.165
You pussy. This is why we're here.

54:01.190 --> 54:04.209
- No! Stop it! Stop it!
- Jules knows this.

54:04.404 --> 54:06.199
Jules.
He doesn't get it, okay.

54:06.224 --> 54:08.392
I'm not leaving.

54:08.537 --> 54:09.820
What? Jules...

54:09.891 --> 54:12.720
We get make fun all the time.
People think we're crazy.

54:12.745 --> 54:15.612
We get ridiculed.
But this shit is why we're here.

54:15.930 --> 54:18.750
What happened was crazy,
but Bryan's right.

54:18.775 --> 54:20.252
I'm not leaving.

54:20.277 --> 54:21.785
Fine.

54:21.949 --> 54:25.958
- We are... Sam
- Sam.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.060
Hey!

54:28.697 --> 54:30.438
You okay?

54:30.723 --> 54:33.260
Do you really expect
me to believe this joke?

54:33.286 --> 54:35.410
I can only tell
you what happened.

54:35.442 --> 54:37.965
And your friend just
flew across the room?

54:37.991 --> 54:40.689
I wouldn't believe
it either before this.

54:42.139 --> 54:43.724
I do now.

54:43.749 --> 54:47.049
Hey! Hey!
What're you going to do huh?

54:47.074 --> 54:49.225
You go knocking the doors and:
"Can you help us?"

54:49.257 --> 54:50.794
We're down the street
breaking into a house.

54:50.819 --> 54:53.709
"We just really need a lift because
our friends kept the car."

54:53.961 --> 54:56.854
I know your mom was in the house
the night of the murders.

54:57.822 --> 54:59.258
What?

54:59.283 --> 55:00.815
Oh, you didn't think
I would find out about that?

55:00.840 --> 55:02.956
What is he talking about?
Your mom was in the house?

55:02.988 --> 55:05.294
I've never told anyone that.
I'm sorry.

55:05.319 --> 55:07.615
You know we have talked about
this about a hundred times.

55:07.655 --> 55:10.908
You never mentioned that
your mom was in the house.

55:12.349 --> 55:14.303
I don't understand?
Why didn't you just tell me.

55:14.328 --> 55:19.309
Something that screwed up...
shapes everything.

55:19.337 --> 55:21.759
Who you are.

55:21.791 --> 55:24.611
How people see you.
It's not something that you bring up.

55:24.636 --> 55:28.054
It's something you pray people
don't find out about.

55:32.412 --> 55:33.722
So.

55:35.660 --> 55:39.683
- Bryan, how did you find out?
- I do my homework, John.

55:40.150 --> 55:43.899
I had to do a whole lot of searching on the
internet to find out that the one survivor...

55:43.947 --> 55:48.303
Sarah Matthews had a son who...
wait for it.

55:48.869 --> 55:51.322
Whose name is John Mitchell.

55:51.347 --> 55:53.941
So my mother was here, the
night of the murders. So what?

55:53.966 --> 55:55.105
Look.

55:55.130 --> 55:57.581
I understand why you wouldn't
want people to know about this.

55:57.606 --> 55:59.296
Alright, I do.

55:59.321 --> 56:03.082
But if it was her who
brought you back here?

56:03.109 --> 56:04.420
To communicate.

56:04.455 --> 56:10.338
And if you leave, you just gonna continue having
the same nightmares and visions of your mom.

56:10.944 --> 56:15.456
Or you can stay.
Stay to have evocation.

56:16.354 --> 56:19.792
Find out what your mother
is trying to tell you.

56:20.064 --> 56:22.423
I think she is in this house.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.482
I think you know that.

56:29.863 --> 56:31.509
Stay.

56:36.785 --> 56:38.989
Hey, I think I got something here.

56:39.014 --> 56:42.431
Wait. Is that a camera
inside the house?

56:43.287 --> 56:46.615
- Looks like a bunch of black.
- Just wait.

57:04.109 --> 57:07.145
- Detective Lewis?
- Yup.

57:07.180 --> 57:12.157
Sir. We just got a report of a stolen
vehicle about a half mile up the road.

57:12.189 --> 57:14.152
2000 red Dodge pickup.

57:14.178 --> 57:15.772
Why am I just hearing about it now?

57:15.797 --> 57:18.148
Owner didn't know it was stole
till he got in from work this morning.

57:18.173 --> 57:21.427
I want you to put out an APB
on a 2000 red dodge pickup.

57:21.475 --> 57:24.817
Anywhere inside a 300 miles radius.
Do you understand. Now!

58:18.809 --> 58:23.664
So tell me what happened during
this ritual, uh... the seance.

58:23.697 --> 58:28.128
They recited some passage
from one of Jules' books.

58:28.154 --> 58:31.730
That she said was used
for communication.

58:33.266 --> 58:37.610
I just wanted some answers to this stuff
so that I can finally get some peace.

58:39.382 --> 58:42.105
Alright. Jules, you want
to walk us through?

58:42.131 --> 58:43.131
Yeah.

58:46.184 --> 58:49.926
Okay. So there are a lot of theories
about how to open these gates..

58:50.325 --> 58:52.603
The idea is that there are essentially
these energy pockets...

58:52.628 --> 58:55.851
Where the air is thinner between
our world and the underworld.

58:57.485 --> 59:01.938
Trick is finding them.
So everybody join hands.

59:04.175 --> 59:07.816
And we're just going to communicate
with the spirits. We're not summoning.

59:07.841 --> 59:10.709
And don't move and don't break the circle.

59:10.734 --> 59:14.185
Because if there is a spirit is present,
our sphere of energy would constrain it.

59:14.210 --> 59:16.387
Does everyone understand.

59:19.702 --> 59:21.769
Okay.
Go ahead, Bryan.

59:26.856 --> 59:32.484
If there're any spirits are present.
Show yourself to us.

59:34.142 --> 59:38.286
We mean you no harm or disruption.

59:38.807 --> 59:41.737
Just indicate your presence.

59:42.810 --> 59:45.645
Indicate your presence to us.

59:46.504 --> 59:50.490
Hear me now,
and indicate your presence

01:00:06.615 --> 01:00:09.436
It's working.
Everyone say calm.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.585
What is it?

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.343
- Just don't move.
- What?

01:00:23.368 --> 01:00:26.568
- Don't do anything.
- Why not?

01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:28.674
Trust me.

01:00:36.784 --> 01:00:40.413
If there are spirits here.
Just tell us why you are here.

01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:45.088
- My stomach.
- What is it?

01:00:53.927 --> 01:00:57.524
- Is this suppose to happens?
- Just hold on and let it run its course.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.891
No, I can't.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:03.506
Whatever happens.
Don't break the circle.

01:01:03.532 --> 01:01:05.036
What are you talking about.
She's in pain.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.581
Let's go.
She's gonna unleash something.

01:01:08.119 --> 01:01:11.695
Put it. Put it back.
What do you mean don't know how?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.324
Michelle.
Don't...!

01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:16.389
Let Go.

01:01:22.629 --> 01:01:25.886
- Mom?
- Let go, John.

01:01:26.598 --> 01:01:28.768
It's time to let go.

01:01:30.502 --> 01:01:33.062
Let go.
Let go.

01:01:36.638 --> 01:01:38.326
No!

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:47.987
Get to the car.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.117
Let's leave.

01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:54.883
- The door.
- What?

01:01:54.918 --> 01:01:56.360
And then what?

01:01:56.385 --> 01:01:58.746
Get me out of here, John.

01:01:59.686 --> 01:02:02.314
I've lost her.
Michelle!

01:02:02.473 --> 01:02:06.325
I tried to find her, but it was dark.
And...

01:02:06.495 --> 01:02:10.603
I can hear people yelling and screaming.

01:02:13.153 --> 01:02:15.517
And I just needed to find Michelle.

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:17.374
Michelle!

01:02:21.108 --> 01:02:22.765
Michelle!

01:02:28.882 --> 01:02:30.528
Bryan.

01:02:32.444 --> 01:02:35.964
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die.

01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:40.934
- Bryan, you alright?
- Everyone must die.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:44.813
Everyone must die.

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:48.804
- Bryan?
- Everyone must die.

01:02:54.414 --> 01:02:57.024
So.
You're saying Bryan became possessed.

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.559
Is that right?

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.254
The killer is filming the murders.

01:03:17.279 --> 01:03:19.714
How is he holding the camera
while he's filming that?

01:03:19.938 --> 01:03:23.807
See those glasses on the table?
We found those where they did the ritual.

01:03:23.832 --> 01:03:26.466
Forensic, you still in the house?
- We're still here sir.

01:03:26.497 --> 01:03:29.615
I want to see exactly what those kids were
using during the seance. You understand.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.088
I want it clearly marked
and I want it in 15.

01:03:32.115 --> 01:03:32.912
Copy that.

01:03:33.013 --> 01:03:35.479
My name is Leonard Abbernacky.

01:03:36.184 --> 01:03:41.222
I lived just down the road. My wife
called me, she wanted me to.. check...

01:03:41.247 --> 01:03:44.674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go back to Abbernacky footage.

01:03:47.377 --> 01:03:51.168
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:52.860
Some distance off it.

01:03:52.885 --> 01:03:55.215
- Crash.
- Car crash.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.440
No. The hearing distance can't be
more than a few miles from here.

01:03:57.465 --> 01:03:59.469
Meaning. We search every road around here.

01:03:59.494 --> 01:04:01.665
That the front of the
house or back of the house?

01:04:02.014 --> 01:04:03.743
That is the front of the house.

01:04:03.768 --> 01:04:06.250
He ain't pointing at the road,
he's pointing at Jackson farm.

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.741
Did you checked Jackson farm?

01:04:07.776 --> 01:04:10.369
- No sir, it's private property.
- Alright, I want you to get everybody.

01:04:10.394 --> 01:04:12.752
I want you to go down to Jackson farm.
I want you look for a red pickup truck.

01:04:12.777 --> 01:04:16.223
There are lots roads and lots of swamps.
So get the dogs and spread out.

01:04:16.248 --> 01:04:17.243
Jackson, Frederick.

01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:18.851
Go back.
Go back again.

01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:22.575
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.464
Some distance off it.

01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:27.728
Let's say that I believe you.

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:30.851
That Bryan became
possessed or changed.

01:04:30.876 --> 01:04:33.281
That still doesn't
make him a murderer.

01:04:33.531 --> 01:04:34.868
I know.

01:04:36.202 --> 01:04:38.212
So.
What happened next?

01:05:08.289 --> 01:05:10.863
Bryan Purcell was attacking
you with an axe?

01:05:10.888 --> 01:05:15.041
He was wearing these glasses with...
the tiny camera on them.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.339
Are you telling me
it was Bryan Purcell?

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:22.632
Yes, but it...
it wasn't him.

01:05:22.773 --> 01:05:25.949
Are you IDing Bryan Purcell?
That's all I need to know.

01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:29.032
I tell you he wasn't human.

01:05:29.057 --> 01:05:30.692
I'll be right back.

01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:36.047
- That all of it?
- Yeah. This is all in front of the room.

01:05:36.072 --> 01:05:37.642
Just in front of it.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:38.825
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:40.356
He just ID Bryan Purcell.

01:05:40.381 --> 01:05:42.648
Said he attacked him with an axe
and then went after everyone else.

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:44.646
- Oh man. And he's sure?
- Yes, he's sure.

01:05:44.671 --> 01:05:45.020
Alright.

01:05:45.045 --> 01:05:47.049
Lewis. You better come down here.
We spotted something.

01:05:47.074 --> 01:05:48.672
On my way, on my way.

01:05:48.697 --> 01:05:51.109
Do me a favor. See if you
can make anything of this.

01:05:51.134 --> 01:05:52.200
Why me?

01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:55.539
Because you're a doctor.
And I was hoping you can read Latin.

01:05:58.034 --> 01:06:00.408
Can you get me gloves, please?

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.221
Bryan Purcell!

01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:12.531
Purcell.

01:06:12.698 --> 01:06:14.599
Mr. Purcell.
Can you hear us?

01:06:22.193 --> 01:06:25.679
Can you hear me?
I got a pulse.

01:06:25.704 --> 01:06:28.766
We've got a 20i.
About a mile north of LaForte Road.

01:06:28.791 --> 01:06:30.955
Victim is seriously injured.

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:33.934
Stay with us buddy. Ambulance's on the way.
You'll be okay.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.853
Hey.
Do you know what this symbol is?

01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:43.715
I believe that is a circle.

01:06:47.478 --> 01:06:48.642
What are you doing?

01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:51.369
I'm doing research that already
should have been done.

01:06:51.394 --> 01:06:54.412
It is a circle painted on the ground.
Those kids are crazy.

01:06:54.437 --> 01:06:56.377
I know... those kids are crazy.

01:06:56.402 --> 01:06:59.863
But it makes sense to someone. And we're
trying to get into that someone's head.

01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:02.130
Can you get me a computer, please.

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:10.135
Hey, Jenkins!
Hurry!

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:13.509
Help!

01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:15.024
Reeves!

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.569
Here!

01:07:17.138 --> 01:07:19.745
Reeves!
Hold on buddy.

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:22.961
Officer down. Suspect is on the foot.
Jesus.

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.985
PICTURE PATTERN RECOGNITION

01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:33.400
Seal of the Left Hand Path.

01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:46.704
Holy shit.
Call the... call the cops.

01:07:51.892 --> 01:07:54.197
- I can't talk right now.
- Okay, just listen then.

01:07:54.222 --> 01:07:55.927
That Latin passage you wanted me to read.

01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:56.917
It's a seance.

01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.573
It's a seance to communicate
with the other side.

01:07:59.598 --> 01:08:03.165
"It says stuff like:
'Come to us. Make your presence known."

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.951
It sounds kind of innocuous,
but then I digged...

01:08:04.976 --> 01:08:08.066
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- Wait. The symbol in the living room...

01:08:08.091 --> 01:08:10.247
It's called "The seal
of the Left Hand Path."

01:08:10.272 --> 01:08:14.052
And it refers to certain places
as prisons that hold demons.

01:08:14.077 --> 01:08:16.796
- Oh, man. This is crazy.
- Hey listen.

01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:20.134
This isn't what I think.
This is what the research says.

01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:22.828
In order for a demon to be
released from a prison,

01:08:22.854 --> 01:08:25.187
everyone involved in the
seance has to die.

01:08:25.212 --> 01:08:27.832
And then it can leave
through a pure human soul.

01:08:27.865 --> 01:08:30.895
Alright. Tell me how this helps me?
How does this help me?

01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:33.221
We're trying to get
inside Bryan's head.

01:08:33.247 --> 01:08:37.560
And if Bryan thinks everyone has to die
for a demon to be released from the house.

01:08:37.586 --> 01:08:39.491
Then he's trying
to kill everyone.

01:08:39.517 --> 01:08:42.292
He's delusional and he's
trying to kill everyone.

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:48.100
All available units, we have a possible
robbery in progress...

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.346
We need to re-establish contact.

01:09:00.372 --> 01:09:02.182
I'm sorry that this is happening.
I shouldn't have left Reeves alone.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.126
Listen to me. Re-establish
communication.

01:09:04.152 --> 01:09:06.363
Let them know Purcell is inside.
You understand.

01:09:06.389 --> 01:09:09.497
Then get back to the crash site.
We need to find Michelle Chapman.

01:09:11.328 --> 01:09:15.069
Bryan Purcell.
My name is Detective Lewis.

01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:17.935
And this doesn't need to go any further.
You understand me?

01:09:18.019 --> 01:09:19.474
Bryan.

01:09:19.876 --> 01:09:22.429
You still have time to explain yourself.

01:09:25.305 --> 01:09:28.470
I want you to get your men ready. In case
this doesn't work. You understand me?

01:09:28.475 --> 01:09:29.828
Yes sir.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.680
Help!

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:37.615
- They found Bryan Purcell.
- What about Michelle?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.069
- No, no Michelle yet.
- He knows where she is.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:44.178
- You got to get her from him now.
- They will.

01:09:44.203 --> 01:09:47.144
I'm going to have one of my men
sent in walkie.

01:09:47.169 --> 01:09:51.477
They're going to come up to the door
and they're going to slide a walkie.

01:09:52.202 --> 01:09:53.799
Here it comes.

01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:58.302
Pick that up, Bryan.

01:10:01.343 --> 01:10:03.340
Pick it up, Bryan.

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:10.372
Do this anyway you want to.
But you have to talk to me, Bryan.

01:10:10.397 --> 01:10:11.789
What the hell is Bryan doing?

01:10:11.814 --> 01:10:12.643
He's stone walling.

01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:14.736
Wh... Michelle could
be bleeding to death.

01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:17.577
John relax.
We're handling it, okay.

01:10:18.753 --> 01:10:20.552
- Tell us where she is at!
- John, stop!

01:10:20.577 --> 01:10:22.273
- Say something, Bryan!
- Stop!

01:10:22.298 --> 01:10:23.718
- (Stop!)
- (Say something!)

01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:26.434
God Damn it, Klein.
You get him off that walkie.

01:10:26.814 --> 01:10:29.853
Tell us where she is!
Tell us where she is!

01:10:30.317 --> 01:10:31.773
Bryan.

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:33.924
Say something!

01:10:33.949 --> 01:10:35.895
- ...thing inside of you. I'm just...
- John!

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.228
Speak!

01:10:42.354 --> 01:10:43.812
Medic!

01:10:45.712 --> 01:10:48.066
- What happening?
- He's having seizures.

01:10:48.629 --> 01:10:49.880
John.

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:52.776
What?

01:10:53.105 --> 01:10:55.678
Alright, talk to me.
What've you got.

01:11:01.818 --> 01:11:02.977
Bryan.

01:11:03.321 --> 01:11:06.069
Mark...
Mark, you need to stop Bryan.

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:12.933
He's going into a cardiac arrest!
We need to get these cuffs off of him!

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:15.402
Bryan is trying to kill John.

01:11:15.428 --> 01:11:17.493
Mark, do something!

01:11:21.186 --> 01:11:23.288
Do something!

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:44.030
Check the clerk.

01:11:45.215 --> 01:11:47.852
Bryan.
Look at me son.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.799
Where is Michelle.

01:11:49.824 --> 01:11:52.007
Tell me where Michelle is.
Is she alive?

01:11:52.032 --> 01:11:53.063
Is Michelle alive?

01:11:53.088 --> 01:11:55.816
Heh, heh, heh...

01:11:56.558 --> 01:11:59.521
What'd you do?
Is she with God?

01:11:59.546 --> 01:12:01.491
Is she with God?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

01:12:01.516 --> 01:12:04.384
Tell me if Michelle is alive.
Shake your head.

01:12:04.409 --> 01:12:06.263
Bryan!
Bryan!

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.822
Bryan!

01:12:11.242 --> 01:12:13.129
Son of a bitch.

01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:17.792
You might want to look at this.
The reason he couldn't talk.

01:12:18.651 --> 01:12:20.217
He's missing his tongue.

01:12:20.242 --> 01:12:22.187
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

01:12:26.739 --> 01:12:29.002
- What the hell happened back there?
- I don't know.

01:12:29.027 --> 01:12:31.564
But when Bryan started to go crazy.
John just lost it. And then.

01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:33.863
I don't know how to say this.
But that guy just flew across the room.

01:12:33.888 --> 01:12:36.795
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not kidding. He flew across the room.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.492
Jesus Christ.

01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:38.825
Hey. You got to listen to me.

01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:41.737
I can't, I can't. I think Bryan
told us where Michelle is.

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.732
- Klein, you read?
- Go for Klein.

01:12:44.757 --> 01:12:47.599
Do you still want to see that
Sara Matthews footage?

01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:18.799
You son of a bitch.

01:13:24.152 --> 01:13:25.319
Michelle.

01:13:25.344 --> 01:13:28.060
Jenkins, get a medic.
We got her.

01:13:28.085 --> 01:13:29.036
Damn it.

01:13:29.061 --> 01:13:32.677
Hey.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:13:33.396 --> 01:13:35.104
Alright.

01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:39.151
You're alright,
you're alright, you're alright.

01:13:39.328 --> 01:13:41.700
Okay. Okay.
You're doing okay.

01:13:41.725 --> 01:13:42.928
Medic!
Get a medic.

01:13:42.953 --> 01:13:45.164
Jenkins, I need help.
Get people up here.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.030
What've you got?

01:13:50.086 --> 01:13:53.018
Sara Matthews.
John's mother.

01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:56.602
Something happened with Martha
during the seance.

01:13:56.655 --> 01:14:00.721
And then after.
She wasn't herself.

01:14:00.839 --> 01:14:05.392
She just kept...
saying that everyone had to die.

01:14:06.804 --> 01:14:09.518
Everyone had to die
so she could be free.

01:14:09.548 --> 01:14:11.202
Now look at this.

01:14:18.056 --> 01:14:20.908
She's pregnant.
Baby okay?

01:14:20.933 --> 01:14:23.294
Too early to tell.
We have to get her to the unit.

01:14:23.319 --> 01:14:26.278
- Wait, wait, wait...
- He's killed them.

01:14:26.303 --> 01:14:28.998
- What're you saying now?
- Same room.

01:14:29.023 --> 01:14:30.518
What room?

01:14:30.589 --> 01:14:31.995
- Same room.
- Same room.

01:14:32.029 --> 01:14:33.752
We have to get her to the ambulance.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

01:14:33.777 --> 01:14:35.035
Let's go.

01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:42.514
Officer.
Can you re-cuff the suspect, please.

01:14:42.998 --> 01:14:44.491
What?

01:14:57.698 --> 01:15:00.401
Stay close, I just need
a minute alone with him.

01:15:00.427 --> 01:15:01.427
Sure thing.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:08.231
I heard them. Michelle alive.
She's going to make it, right?

01:15:08.668 --> 01:15:11.215
I don't know John.
Do you want her to make it?

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:13.996
I like that very much.

01:15:14.919 --> 01:15:17.566
It was you.
It wasn't Bryan.

01:15:17.661 --> 01:15:21.344
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
For me to live.

01:15:21.369 --> 01:15:24.002
You manipulated
this whole night.

01:15:24.094 --> 01:15:26.593
But it didn't work.
Because everyone didn't die.

01:15:26.618 --> 01:15:28.568
Michelle is still alive.

01:15:28.728 --> 01:15:33.411
So, is there anything you want to tell me before
you go to prison for the rest of your life.

01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:36.371
I'm not going to prison,
Elizabeth.

01:15:38.338 --> 01:15:39.948
I'm leaving it.

01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:43.166
Okay.
Maybe you didn't hear me.

01:15:43.201 --> 01:15:44.659
But, everybody didn't die.

01:15:44.684 --> 01:15:47.439
Your little ritual didn't work
because Michelle is still alive.

01:15:47.464 --> 01:15:50.138
- And you're still alive.
- You're wrong.

01:15:52.822 --> 01:15:55.088
Jesus Christ.

01:15:56.992 --> 01:16:03.018
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:07.176
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.

01:16:10.989 --> 01:16:13.221
Everyone must die.

01:16:13.943 --> 01:16:18.919
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.480
Klein.

01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:54.961
The ritual is working.

01:17:01.331 --> 01:17:03.234
Open the door.

01:17:06.892 --> 01:17:09.358
Open the god damn door!
Move!

01:17:14.519 --> 01:17:18.361
John's mother was my vessel,
but she escaped.

01:17:18.396 --> 01:17:21.526
Now Michelle is my vessel.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.408
And once she crosses the seal,
I'll be free.

01:17:37.455 --> 01:17:38.909
Elizabeth!

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.284
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.

01:17:42.326 --> 01:17:45.420
That's okay. Alright. Alright.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:17:45.459 --> 01:17:47.153
He's gone.
He's gone.

01:17:47.178 --> 01:17:50.183
He disappeared. He disappeared.
It was him. It was John.

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.764
He killed all of them.

01:17:51.789 --> 01:17:54.236
And I know you're not going to believe me.
He became possessed.

01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:58.318
He's dead. He's in the house.
So I know he's dead. He's hung himself.

01:17:58.353 --> 01:18:00.210
- He's in the house and he's hung himself.
- No, no, no...

01:18:00.235 --> 01:18:01.482
He's dead and I'm telling
you I just saw it.

01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:01.981
No, no, no...

01:18:02.006 --> 01:18:03.817
I just saw it.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.797
He was just sitting there...

01:18:06.832 --> 01:18:09.156
and I started choking.

01:18:09.266 --> 01:18:10.773
Look!
Look at it!

01:18:10.798 --> 01:18:12.720
Look at this.
Look.

01:18:13.023 --> 01:18:15.966
See.
See.

01:18:17.988 --> 01:18:19.450
I don't understand.

01:18:19.475 --> 01:18:22.568
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house...

01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:27.744
And then there's no documentation. Nothing
to show what happened in that house.

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.595
Can you explain that?

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.938
How do you explain that?

01:18:32.237 --> 01:18:33.607
I can't.

01:18:33.932 --> 01:18:35.473
I can't

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:49.055
I just...

01:18:49.282 --> 01:18:51.042
I just felt it kick.

01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:52.926
Is this the first one.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:59.803
Just gonna get a quick listen
to your baby, alright.

01:19:11.968 --> 01:19:13.476
Okay.

01:19:14.302 --> 01:19:18.396
You don't have anything to worry about.
Your baby is going to be just fine.
