35:46.535 --> 35:47.928
- We did what we had to do,

35:47.971 --> 35:49.756
and we released him
without pressing any charges.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.454
- Yeah, but Webb
doesn't trust him now,

not to trust me.

One of the reasons

of the criminals

Van Aller comes in

37:05.614 --> 37:07.225
Van Aller turns around,

37:07.268 --> 37:08.835
his entire back
is soaked in blood.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.011
This little nasty bitch
slashed him.

37:11.054 --> 37:14.580
[groans and laughter]
- That's my kind of girl.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.321
- Well, look who the cat
dragged in.

37:16.364 --> 37:17.713
all: Hey!

37:17.757 --> 37:18.845
- All right.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.107
- The return of
the conquering hero.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.718
- All right.
- Hey.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.417
Takes more than a couple
bullets to put me down, right?

37:25.460 --> 37:28.246
- Let me buy you a drink, huh?
- Thanks, guys.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.638
- Two whiskeys, neat.
You look good.

37:29.682 --> 37:32.815
- Thanks.
You look like hell.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.950
You all right?
- Eh.

37:39.866 --> 37:40.910
- Thanks.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.828
So give the highlights.
Tell me what went on.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.788
- I have no idea, man.
I mean...

37:50.311 --> 37:51.399
- What?

37:51.443 --> 37:52.922
- I'm still trying
to figure it out.

37:52.966 --> 37:56.274
You know, he was just
shaky all night, on edge.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.755
But the sale went down
without a hitch.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.757
- And so what--and when he
dropped you off here,

38:01.801 --> 38:02.976
and he didn't say anything?
I mean, anything?

38:03.019 --> 38:04.934
- No, no.
You know, I said, "come on in.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.196
Let me buy you a drink."

38:06.240 --> 38:08.416
He's like, "Oh, you know,
give me a minute."

38:08.460 --> 38:10.766
So I'm in here
and I'm telling you,

38:10.810 --> 38:12.290
I was in here
less than a minute

38:12.333 --> 38:13.595
and I'm not feeling right,
right?

38:13.639 --> 38:15.205
So I go out to check on him.

38:15.249 --> 38:18.731
Boom. Right in front of me.

38:18.774 --> 38:23.562
I, uh, I got this off of him
before the paramedics arrived.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.347
- That is great, Stabler.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.393
Oh, man, that's even better.

You're saving my ass.

38:36.139 --> 38:38.316
- No, no that's--
- No, no.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.534
Take it, brother.
- No.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.840

Van Aller wasn't cut out

39:00.207 --> 39:02.949
You know, there was a story
about your dad

39:02.992 --> 39:04.298
that was famous
in my house growing up.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.473
- Hmm.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.476
- So your dad and his partner,
right?

39:08.520 --> 39:11.479
They're cleaning house,
no warrants,

39:11.523 --> 39:13.960

by this hothead kid

who's unarmed, right?

39:15.875 --> 39:22.360
So your dad's partner spooks,
shoots the kid.

39:22.403 --> 39:23.839
- Dead?
- Dead.

39:23.883 --> 39:27.016
Dead, right?
So now a major screw up.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.148
They gotta make it look,

39:28.191 --> 39:30.063
you know,
they justified the shooting.

39:30.106 --> 39:33.414
So your dad searches the house,
finds a gun,

39:33.458 --> 39:36.722
has his partner
shoot him in the leg

39:36.765 --> 39:39.507

Joe was defending him.

39:41.683 --> 39:44.947
All right, you want
to talk about cojones?

39:44.991 --> 39:48.386
So Joe Stabler
got a damn Combat Cross

39:48.429 --> 39:49.952
for taking that bullet.

39:52.259 --> 39:53.695
You want to talk about loyalty?

39:53.739 --> 39:55.349
You want to talk
about brotherhood?
