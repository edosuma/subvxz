00:01.300 --> 00:02.800
Previously on Rescue Me...

00:03.100 --> 00:04.800
I bought this for us. I-

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
You think i wanted this?

00:06.300 --> 00:08.600
Huh?is that what you think?
You son of a bitch!

00:09.900 --> 00:13.100
Shit! Tommy. Tommy!

00:13.300 --> 00:14.000
Tommy!

00:16.400 --> 00:19.400
What really happened that night?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.000
You know the truth, tommy.

00:21.200 --> 00:21.800
What?

00:22.100 --> 00:23.200
You couldn't get it up.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.200
I tried everything.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.600
It's not that funny.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.900
Your limp, lifeless little dick

00:29.900 --> 00:31.500
Might actually save your ass.

00:32.900 --> 00:33.500
Ha ha ha!

00:34.200 --> 00:35.100
You wanna go play chief,

00:35.100 --> 00:37.000
You go play at some other goddamn house.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.600
This is my house.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.700
I make the rules.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.500
You know why she's
Marrying you, right?

00:41.600 --> 00:44.400
Because i'm a big, strong,
Attractive, almost thin guy

00:44.400 --> 00:46.800
Who's not afraid to express
Himself justice-wise.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.400
No, because you're trapped in here,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.100
And she knows that
You're not gonna cheat on her.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.300
I got a girl.

00:51.700 --> 00:52.300
Really?

00:52.900 --> 00:54.200
She's in a wheelchair.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.400
But she's got the sweetest ass.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.500
Who's the guy?

01:00.300 --> 01:01.500
That's my vollie.

01:01.900 --> 01:02.800
That's my lifesaver.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.300
He's the one that pulled me out.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.600
You're datin' the guy
Who saved your life?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.300
Yeah.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.400

01:15.700 --> 01:16.500
She's 18 now?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.800
Yeah, but--but
You gonna help me or what?

01:19.900 --> 01:21.100

Who's the lucky girl?

01:27.600 --> 01:29.700
Steven, my boyfriend.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.900
I'd like you to sort of be my best man.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.900
I want you to do something for me.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.300
Anything, ma.

01:37.100 --> 01:37.800

This kid a serious offer.

Mr. Gavin, please.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.600
It's not what it looks like.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.400
Fake baby head?

03:05.900 --> 03:07.200
That's the name
Of my new band.

Hormones who also happens to be
A rock-'n'-roll fanatic,all right?

03:26.100 --> 03:28.200
If that couch was the
Lead singer in fake baby head,

03:28.200 --> 03:29.700
She'd be having sex with it, ok?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.600

04:22.600 --> 04:24.400
I told your mother i was
Bringin' you home. Let's go.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.700
No! I can't live with
Your shit anymore!

04:27.300 --> 04:30.600
Ok?there's no screaming or
Fighting or drinking here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.800
Ok, there's a little bit of drinking, but--

04:33.000 --> 04:36.300
But i never wake up to find my
Father passed out on the couch.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.100
You don't own me anymore.
I'm legal!

04:39.400 --> 04:43.200
And i'm staying here with someone who
Loves me and who treats me with respect.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.300
Eat shit and die,
Dad. Go to hell.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.800

Sync:frm@¾²¾²</font>

05:44.200 --> 05:47.300
You know, you could have come to me
And we could have discussed a plan

05:48.000 --> 05:49.500
A plan based on common sense,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.100
Ok, on how she felt
And on how i felt.

05:53.100 --> 05:57.100
But no,as usual,all you could do
Was think about how you felt.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.500
You know, at this point,

05:58.700 --> 06:02.700
I would think that acting like an animal
Would no longer even be an option.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
You know, w-when are you gonna get it

06:07.000 --> 06:10.600
Through someone in the face
Is not going to solve anything?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.800
Huh? When?

06:19.200 --> 06:20.400
Oh, my god.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Is he asleep?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.600
No. I don't think so.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.600
Shh.shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:28.200 --> 06:28.900
You know what?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.700
Keep--keep criticizing me.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.200
I think
It's--i think it's workin'.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.800
What?
Yeah. Lay it on me.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.300
It's not like that's gonna be a problem.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.700
I mean,i could go on all day about
What a lousy father you are.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.600
That's right.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.600
Hmm? And about how controlling
And manipulative you can be.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.600
That's right.
Daddy's very controlling.

06:49.100 --> 06:49.900
Yes, he can.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.300
Ok, you wanna know
What you're gonna do?

06:52.300 --> 06:53.000
What?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.400
You're gonna go back to tony's
And you are gonna apologize.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.400
I certainly am not.
No, i'm not.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.300
Tommy, you are going over there
To apologize.i'm not apologizing.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.800
Because that is the only way that
We might get our daughter back.

07:03.000 --> 07:03.900
And now,

07:03.900 --> 07:06.800
I'm gonna continue to bad-mouth
You from this other room here

07:07.900 --> 07:11.700
Because the mere sight of
Your daddy is making me sick.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.300
And now you,

07:13.300 --> 07:16.900
Your daddy is a selfish,
Selfish prick.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.300
Mm-hmm. Yes, he is.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400
You gotta do
Somethin'for me, stu.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.300
I gotta be able to
Take that test again.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.600
Jerry, i looked at your file.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.700
Your heart, you got
Permanent damage.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.300
I'm in the best goddamn
Shape of my life.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.800
Doesn't matter.
Could run a goddamn marathon,

07:30.800 --> 07:32.700
But have a heart attack
Clipping your toenails.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.100
Plus all that shit in
Your lungs from ground zero.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.100
I'm not saying you're
Gonna die tomorrow,

07:37.300 --> 07:39.600
But i wouldn't be buying
Green bananas, you know?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.400
Jesus, stu.
I'm kidding, sort of.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.600
Look,the department
Can't take the chance.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.600
They give you another
Shot at the test

07:47.900 --> 07:51.200
You croak during it or on
The job later,they're screwed.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.300
Your family could take the
City to the goddamn cleaners.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.600
Look, i got some cash.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.000
It's not much, but we could
Grease somebody's palm. You--

08:03.000 --> 08:05.600
Jerry, stop.
Time to hang it up.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.700
I gotta get back, stu.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.300
I got nothin' else.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Ok, let me run something by you.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.200
I got an opening in my department here.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.500
I could use a vet like you.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.200
What, pushin' a pencil?

08:23.200 --> 08:26.600
You move paper around,look
Busy a couple hours a day.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.700
Jerry, i'm 10 years down here.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.600
Life ain't so bad.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.500
10 years chained
To a desk,huh?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.700
Beats bustin' your
Hump out on the job.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.100
You don't freeze
In the winter.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.400
You don't sweat
In the summer.

08:39.299 --> 08:40.500
Take home a nice paycheck,

08:40.500 --> 08:42.799
And you got somewhere
To go 5 days a week.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.400
And, oh,heh.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.300
You don't burn to death.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.000
Think about it, huh?

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
Hey.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.700

He's the way to go in...

09:09.100 --> 09:09.800
Really?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.700
Two thousand--yeah. I'm--
I'm not done with it yet.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.500
You all right?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.000
Yeah, fine. Why?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.100
I don't know. You just

09:19.400 --> 09:21.600
Weary,sleepy, somethin'.

Newborn baby
At home. Hello.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.100

I can't put him on the phone.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.300
The poor guy's grief-stricken.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.200
How you doin',mike?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.100

He sounds ok to me.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.600
Yeah, well, you know,
He's in one of those stages.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.000
You know,they have the
3 stages when people die.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
It's grieving,d-denial, burial.
He's in the denial phase.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.200
All right, so you guys are
You going to the hospital

14:46.200 --> 14:49.100

14:53.400 --> 14:56.700
Throwin' some good food
Into him so he can,you know

14:56.700 --> 15:00.000
Get ready to be an orphan in
The next 48 hours or so.

So where you guys going?

15:01.700 --> 15:03.700

15:06.400 --> 15:08.000
Frank angelo and maxie's.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000

15:09.000 --> 15:10.100
Look, nona,

15:10.800 --> 15:11.500
You're an attractive girl.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.100
I like you, ok?
Yeah, whatever.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.600
When are we going out?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.200
It's just a scheduling problem,
You know. I mean, sh--look.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.700
Truthfully i don't think this
Broad's gonna make it through,

15:20.700 --> 15:22.400
You know, the rest of the week,

15:22.400 --> 15:24.800
So--you know, unless she lingers

15:25.800 --> 15:27.200
And goes into a coma or somethin'.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.000
But that's not a problem for me,
Cause i date during comas.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.900
Actually been on a
Couple dates with people who

15:31.900 --> 15:34.400
Were in comas while we were
On the dates, i think.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.400
Hello? Nona?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.200
That was rude.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.600
So we're on, then?

15:45.500 --> 15:45.900
No.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Aw, come on, tom. I mean,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.100
It's just--you know,

15:49.100 --> 15:51.500
You know what? One hour,
No appetizers, no drinks beforehand,

15:51.500 --> 15:53.000
And you're paying for everything.

15:53.000 --> 15:53.700
Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.700
No.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.300
Jesus christ.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.400
Aah!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.700
Jesus christ,
Where ya been?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.100
I been waiting
Here for, like, hours.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.900
You got nothin' to eat
Or drink in the whole place.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.000
How did youget in here?

16:18.100 --> 16:19.700
I used to be a fireman,lenny,

16:19.700 --> 16:21.500
Not to mention a criminal mastermind.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.300
You bust in my window?

16:23.700 --> 16:24.900
I'll fix it later.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.700
I'm just not really
Comfortable with being outside.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.200
I went right from
Living in a firehouse

16:29.200 --> 16:30.500
To living in the big house.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.600
Teddy...

16:32.300 --> 16:34.300
Mmm. Mushroom. Good choice.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.800
Teddy, what the hell
Are you doin' here?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.300
Remember how you told me

16:38.500 --> 16:40.600
Ellie would lose interest in me
When i got sprung?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.900
Well,it didn't work out
That way,my friend.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
I had to ditch her
Downtown in a coffee shop.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.700
I been on the run ever since.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.700
Hey, i never took you for
A light beer drinker.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.900
He called me a couple hours
Ago looking for you.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.000
Ellie called you?
What'd you tell her?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.900
That i hadn't seen or
Heard from you.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.600
Oh, good man.
I called my brother.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.800
He says she's been calling
Over there every half-hour.

17:02.300 --> 17:05.300
It's like a gigantic net of
Need has blanketed the city!

17:05.300 --> 17:06.400
You gotta hide me.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.800
Oh. You know, teddy,

17:07.800 --> 17:09.800
My place is kinda small.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.800
Oh, come on.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.200
You're the one who
Said she'd bail on me.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.300
You owe me.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.300
Fine.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.200
Oh, hey, i would tell
You to make yourself at home,

17:20.200 --> 17:21.900
But it seems like you
Already did that.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.200
You're payin'
For the window.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.800
Jesus, lou. Look at
The size of that one.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.200
You know, at what point do

17:27.200 --> 17:29.100
You make the turn from wanting
A little definition to

17:29.100 --> 17:31.000
Becoming the incredible
Hulk with tits?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.400
Aw, no, no, no
Take a closer look.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.700
These chicks don't
Have tits anymore.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.000
Jesus. Could you imagine having
Sex with one of those girls?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.600
Aw, man.please.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.500
The word "sex"just makes me want
To crawl into a hole and die.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.000
Why? The nun still
Goin'full steam?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.300
Gentlemen, if you ever get
The chance to become

17:44.300 --> 17:46.700
Romantically involved with
A nun, brace yourself.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.100
All those years she was
Saving herself for the lord,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.300
Not indulging in fornication,

17:52.300 --> 17:54.000
Well, when that dam breaks,

17:55.300 --> 17:56.700
It breaks in a big way.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.100
It's like a tsunami,
Only instead of water,

17:59.100 --> 18:00.600
You get hit with sex

18:01.300 --> 18:05.300
--exotic positions,rubbing,
Touching,sucking, probing.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.700
The tsunami speech again?

18:06.700 --> 18:08.500
I mean, the wave
Just keeps coming

18:08.500 --> 18:10.900
Destroying everything in its path.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.400
What i wouldn't give for
2 hours of straight sleep.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.500
Well, why don't you
Just tell her you

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
Wanna take a break
From the sex thing?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
That's what i'm doing.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
Uh, no, mikey.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.300
What you're doing is
Called not getting laid.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.700
No. It's a conscious
Choice,frank. I'm celibate.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.000
So, um, no pussy whatsoever?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Nope.
And no more with the cocks

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And the balls and the hairy
Asses and all that?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
No, none of it.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.400
Yeah, but you're still
Pullin' pud, right?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.200
Are you kiddin'?
I'm forming calluses.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.200
Attaboy.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.000
So, uh,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.600
How long is this no sex
Experiment supposed to last,anyway?

18:39.600 --> 18:41.200
Until my cock resets.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.200
Or he cuts off his
Hands in shop class.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.100
You know,
I could help you out, mikey.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.100
I got a giant box of maggie's porn.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.800
I can let you borrow
Some if you need help,

18:47.800 --> 18:48.900
You know, raisin' the flag.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.700
Aw, jeez, sean.i mean,

18:50.900 --> 18:52.100
I may kind of been with a guy,

18:52.100 --> 18:54.500
But i'm not such a homo that
I can't pop wood at will.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
It's--not poppin' wood at
Will doesn't mean, you know,

18:57.800 --> 18:59.200
You're a homo.
It just means,

18:59.200 --> 19:00.400
You, you know might have a,

19:00.800 --> 19:03.400
You know, emotional blockage

19:03.400 --> 19:05.700
You know, temporary kind of

19:05.700 --> 19:07.000
Mmm. Like being a homo.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.000
Man...

19:08.000 --> 19:09.700
Oh, my god
Look at this one.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.500
Oh. Jeez. You know, tommy,

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
If you ever got the balls up to

19:13.500 --> 19:14.700
Ask out that vollie, this is

19:14.700 --> 19:17.400
What she may look like
Underneath that uniform.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.900
First of all, i did ask out

19:18.900 --> 19:20.100
The vollie. I'm takin' her out.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.500

You somethin' else.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.700

Is like 110 pounds.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.000
She's all woman.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah. Well, she pulled your
Sorry ass out of a fire.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.800
Allegedly.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.000
Maybe she's juicin'.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.300
Juice--the only juice
She's juicin' is...

19:35.000 --> 19:36.400
Cranberry juice.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.900
Tommy, maybe
You wanna go upstairs

19:37.900 --> 19:39.000
Take a little nappy nap.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.900
Yeah. I think i will.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.700
Hey, tommy, um, you gonna
Pick me up tomorrow night,

19:42.700 --> 19:44.200
Or should i come by and get you?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No, hold on here hold on here.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.100
You wanna share this with
The rest of the class, please?

19:48.100 --> 19:49.200
Yeah.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.400
Hey, chief.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.600
Hey, guys.come on in the kitchen.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.900
I got somethin'
I wanna talk to you about.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.900
This is such a good idea.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.000
Stick around.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.100
I'm full of 'em.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.000
I'll bet you are.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.600

20:03.600 --> 20:04.100
No.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.000
You're not like the
Cuginettes on long island.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.200
You got class.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.500
I mean it.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.200
Yeah, well, i have found

20:13.900 --> 20:15.200
That after you nearly die

20:15.700 --> 20:17.500
You start takin',like, a little

20:17.900 --> 20:19.400
Personal inventory,you know?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I mean,i got a second
Chance 'cause of you

20:22.000 --> 20:23.300
And i wanna do something with it

20:23.300 --> 20:24.900
I wanna be a better person.
I wanna,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.900
Y set a better example for my son

20:27.900 --> 20:30.000
Or somethin' like that. Ohh!

20:30.900 --> 20:32.000
You ok?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Heh heh. Yeah. Heh heh.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.100
My tootsies are cold.
Can we take a break?

20:36.100 --> 20:37.000
Yeah.
Yeah?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.500
Come on. Let's go.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.700
So that's it?

20:40.700 --> 20:44.200
Yeah, pretty much. 5 days
A week down at headquarters.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.900
Put away a couple of bucks.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.400
Maybe move down to hilton head

20:47.400 --> 20:50.000
And spend the rest of my days
Workin' on my handicap.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.000
It's a golf reference.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.300
Any questions? Reactions?

20:55.600 --> 20:57.100
Just such a shock.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.200
Yeah, there's nobody more
Shocked than me, tom.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.900
I'm ok with it now,
Though. You know,

21:02.100 --> 21:03.300
It's not like my life was

21:03.300 --> 21:05.000
A piece of cake
Around here,anyway.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.600
Nothing changes,
Nothing changes.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.200
Yeah, but you at least
Gotta let us throw you

21:09.200 --> 21:10.400
A retirement shindig, chief.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.000
No, no, no.
I'm not retiring.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.400
I'm still be around in
Case you guys need me.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.100
Well, let us at least buy you

21:15.100 --> 21:16.000
A couple drinks after the shift.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah. Nah,
I don't want a big to-do

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
About this, you know?

21:19.600 --> 21:20.900
The less ceremony the better.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
Plus,i gotta drive up to boston

21:22.800 --> 21:25.500
For pete's commitment
Ceremony tomorrow.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.000
Oh, that's right.
You're the father of the bride.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
You nervous?

21:28.400 --> 21:29.400
A little bit.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.600
I want him to feel
Like i accepted him.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.900
Have you?

21:33.500 --> 21:36.200
Nah, but i want him
To think i do.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, well, then you gotta
Try to assimilate, chief,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.300
You know, dress the part.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.200
Assimilate?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.600
You remember the birthday party
Peter threw a couple years ago?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.900
We stood out like a couple of big sore,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.300
Heterosexual thumbs.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.000
I mean, not sean

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
And mike so much but you know,

21:47.400 --> 21:48.800
The real men on the crew.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
I got a new suit.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.900
Nice,navy blue, single-breasted.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.100
Nah, that's not gonna
Get you anywhere, chief.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.800
You gotta show a
Little bit more flair,

21:55.800 --> 21:57.900
Be flamboyant, you know,
Let your freak flag fly.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.400
I--
I think i'll stick with what i got.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.700
But your collective shitty advice
Is greatly appreciated as always.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.500
All right, boys,
I'm--go upstairs for bed.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.400
Night, chief.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.100
Anytime, chief.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.600
You, uh, heard from
Your lawyer yet?

22:17.200 --> 22:18.600
No. Soon, though.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.300
Think tommy'll
Have to go to jail?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.900
I don't know. I
--i don't think so.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.400
I mean, i hope not.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.200
I don't--the whole thing's
Such a goddamn mess.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.400
You love him, don't you?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.400
It's ok.
It's just, you know,

22:34.400 --> 22:36.000
Hard not to notice. Every time

22:36.000 --> 22:37.400
I bring his name up, it's like,

22:37.400 --> 22:39.700
You know, somethin' gets lit.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.800
Yeah, well, you happen to
Bring up his name a lot, so...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.500
Well, that's because he's
Like a legend at our house,

22:46.500 --> 22:49.000
You know. Everybody tells
Stories about his saves.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.200
Yeah, he's a real heroic
Son of a bitch.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.500
So, you love him, right?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.600
Maybe, but

23:01.000 --> 23:02.200
It's like

23:02.700 --> 23:04.200
The bad kind of love.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.700
Well, i guess, uh,

23:06.700 --> 23:09.700
Bad love's better than
No love at all,right?

23:11.100 --> 23:13.400
You are so cute.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.500
Heh heh.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.100
You are so cute.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.500
Hey, uh...
Hey.

23:23.900 --> 23:26.500
So you all right with this?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.400
Yeah. Ready to move on, tom.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.700
Yeah?
Mmm.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.200
So you're, uh--
You're readyto be a, uh...

23:35.800 --> 23:37.300
Pencil pusher?

23:37.300 --> 23:39.700
Pfft. I was gonna
Say desk jockey.

23:39.700 --> 23:43.000
Ah. Listen, uh
I hate to do this

23:43.000 --> 23:44.600
But i gotta ask you a favor.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.700
Sure. For you, tom, anything.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.400
Right. I think the insurance
Company's gonna drop these charges

23:49.400 --> 23:51.900
But, uh, i'm gettin'
Wind that somebody down

23:51.900 --> 23:54.000
At headquarters is
Gonna start sniffin' around.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.600
Could be a real pain
In the ass for me.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.500
I'll look into it.

23:57.900 --> 23:58.900
That'd be great.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.600
Thanks, chief.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.400
Yeah, you mean jerry.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.900
The chief's upstairs
In my office.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.400
Yeah, whatever.
I meant what i said.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.500
Maybe bowling wasn't
The best idea, huh?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.200
It's better than paintball.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.900
They're havin' a great time.

24:28.900 --> 24:29.900
Yeah. We've been here for,

24:29.900 --> 24:32.100
Like, an hour and a half, and
We're still on the third frame.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.900
Well, think of it as more
Time we get to spend together.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.500
Cute couple, huh?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.500
Wh-what are you doin', babe?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.400
I'm giving you an
Invitation to kiss me.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.900
Hey, good effort, barbara.
Nice one.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.600
What is it with you?

24:53.700 --> 24:54.600
What?i don't know.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.000
You used to be all over me,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.700
And now anytime
I try to get close to you

24:57.700 --> 24:59.800
Or i wanna spend some time
Alone with you,

25:00.200 --> 25:02.600
Yo some excuse, or you insist
We bring richie along.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.400
I'm just--you know, i'm
Trying to spend time with him,

25:05.400 --> 25:06.700
Be a part of his life,
Be a good guy.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.600
Yeah, i know. It--it's sweet,

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
But it's just
You seem a little

25:09.600 --> 25:12.000
More concerned about him
Than you do about me.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.200
Well, he's retarded.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.100
About us.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.200
What about us? We're fine.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.800
Well, i'm not fine.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.900
I'm tired of living with 2
Retarded people--one mentally,

25:20.200 --> 25:22.600
The other emotionally
I mean, do you--

25:22.600 --> 25:25.100
Do you put any thought at
All into this relationship?

25:25.500 --> 25:26.400
More than you know.

25:27.000 --> 25:27.900
So tell me.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.700
I--i can't right now.
You can't.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Look, nat, you know,
We only got 30 minutes left.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.400
I'm trying to break a hundred.
Can we maybe talk after?

25:39.800 --> 25:40.800
I'll tell you what.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Let's not talk at all.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.400
Let's just go about our lives
Like nothing is wrong and

25:44.400 --> 25:47.400
Let things fester until we
Completely destroy the relationship.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.600
Is that a real option?

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
Nat. Natalie, i was joking.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.100
You go, franco.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The steak fry it's really good,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.200
And they also have
Like,this killer,

26:03.200 --> 26:04.900
Like cheesy pasta thing
It's like--

26:04.900 --> 26:06.500
Whatever. Ok, what's up?
What's up?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.600
What?

26:10.300 --> 26:12.100
Well, um...

26:12.400 --> 26:14.400
I know. You wanna--you wanna
Talk about your mom.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.300
What's--what's
--what's the deal?

26:17.100 --> 26:18.800
She--she's like, you know--

26:18.800 --> 26:20.200
Yeah, i know. I know.
She was bad.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.300
Now she's worse. She's
Probably in a shitload of pain,

26:22.300 --> 26:23.300
Blah, blah, blah.
Come on, kid.

26:23.300 --> 26:24.100
What's the deal?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.400
You got 58 minutes left.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.300
What?

26:29.600 --> 26:32.500
Well, she--she--

26:33.400 --> 26:36.200
She asked me to kill her.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.200
Shit.
Yeah.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.000
Wow.
I know.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.900
Sorry, kid.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.300
How?
I don't know.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.300
You know, i was thinkin' of,
Like, maybe, like,

26:52.200 --> 26:54.000
Takin' a pillow and--

26:54.000 --> 26:55.200
What, and smother her?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.000
No?
No. You can't do that.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.200
Way too much work.

26:59.900 --> 27:02.700
You got the strugglin'
And arms flailin',

27:03.900 --> 27:05.200
Not to mention
The muffled screams.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.300
Nurse walks in.
No.can't do that.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.700
That's a tough one, kid.
I don't know.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.200
You--hey, hey, hey.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.600
I swear to god.
You start cryin',

27:16.000 --> 27:17.900
And i'm outta here.
Stop. Christ.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.300
It's my mom, you know.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.900
I know. I know. Listen.listen.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.500
Stop. Stop.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.500
Listen to me. Mikey,listen.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.600
It's your--
It's your mom.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.400
It's the woman who brought
You into this world.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.700
Listen to me

27:35.900 --> 27:38.300
And it's her dying request,

27:39.500 --> 27:40.800
So you--you have to honor it,

27:41.200 --> 27:42.500
What--what she asks.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.400
What,they probably got her on,
Like,a morphine drip right?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.700
So the easiest thing to do is
To just increase the amount,

27:49.200 --> 27:51.000
Like 3 or 4 times
What she's already gettin',

27:51.400 --> 27:53.000
And that way,
She basically overdoses,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.400
But she'll nev--she'll die
In her sleep, basically.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.900
Jeez, tom, i--i don't know.

27:58.200 --> 28:01.800
Listen to me.
You gotta do this, ok?

28:03.100 --> 28:05.000
It's the la she
Asked you for.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.500
You owe it to her.
You suck it up.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.100
Let her die with some dignity.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.900
All right?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.300
All right, stop. Stop, opst,

28:18.300 --> 28:19.700
Stop. Come on.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.200
You all right?

28:23.100 --> 28:24.000
Hey,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.700
Is thia isgay place?
Huh?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.300
Let go of me.
Let go of me.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.200
Ahem.
Why is it all guys in here?

28:42.200 --> 28:44.000
It's not all guys.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.500
Mostly guys.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.900
It's probably
The "mandate" thing.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.000
The what?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.700
I--i read about this place
In new york magazine.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.800
It's like this new fad.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.400
It's called mandating.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.300
It's like, ahem,
When guys go out to dinner and--

29:05.300 --> 29:07.500
And they talk about things and--

29:07.500 --> 29:09.700
And--but they don't talk about,

29:09.700 --> 29:11.100
Like, you know, cars and sports

29:11.100 --> 29:12.600
And stuff like that.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.300
That's why there's
No tvs in here.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.800
Yeah, or pussy.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.300
We can call it "bromancing"
If it makes you feel better.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.400
Let me tell you something.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.300
You ask a guy out
To a place like this,

29:23.300 --> 29:25.500
You gotta give him a
Heads-up about what's goin' on.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.700
Tom.
Take your hand off my hand.

29:28.700 --> 29:29.500
Take your hand off my hand.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.600
It's not a date thing.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.300
Take your hand off my hand.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.000
Comon, tommy.
Ieed you, man.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.600
What are you lookin' at?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.300
Oh, n-nothin'. I was--

29:44.300 --> 29:46.900
I was lookin' at the wine rack.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.500
You wanna take
This shit outside?

29:48.700 --> 29:51.200
No. It's cold outside
I don't wanna--

29:52.000 --> 29:54.200
Hey. My date's here.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.000
Surprise.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.500
Hi.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.700
Hi. That's my, uh
Woman date.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.400
Are you guys ready
To order yet?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.100
I don't--i think we're gonna go.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.500
Go. Come on, let's go.
What  house of homos in here.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.800
So is it really true that you

30:10.800 --> 30:13.000
Carried tommy out of that
Beach house fire?

30:13.000 --> 30:13.700
Yep.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.800
And you didn't even have
Any help or anything?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.000
Nope. You know, with
The adrenaline pumping and

30:18.000 --> 30:20.100
Everything, i could've carried
Out jennifer hudson,

30:21.100 --> 30:23.200
Olding her oscar and a sandwich.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.400
Let me just get this straight.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.000
So, it was a drag
And carry, right?

30:27.600 --> 30:29.000
No.i mean,
Like you dragged me

30:29.300 --> 30:30.300
From the living room to the--

30:30.800 --> 30:31.500
To the door, and then you
Carried me--

30:31.500 --> 30:34.600
No. I picked you up, i
Threw you over my shoulder,

30:34.600 --> 30:36.100
And i carried your ass to safety.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.400
You should be grateful.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.700
I--i--you know.
You should be grateful.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.500
Yeah. I'm grateful.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.400
I just--think--what,
You weigh a buck, 10.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.500
I did.
She picked me up.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.600
Ok,you did.

30:44.100 --> 30:44.900
All right. Hey, nona.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.700
Nona. No--what--what are you--

30:47.600 --> 30:49.100
All right, you made your point.
Put me down.

30:49.100 --> 30:52.000
What, you too cheap
To pay for a cab, asshole?

30:52.800 --> 30:56.000
Yeah, you just--you're lucky
She has me up like this, pal,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.300
'Cause if i was on my feet,

30:57.300 --> 30:58.800
It'd be a--what are you--
What are you doing?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.600
What?

31:02.900 --> 31:05.300
Oh, hello. Just go away.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.700
He's not worth it. Come on.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
Anytime.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.800
I got my truck over here.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.500
Let's go.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.200
Where you goin'?

31:17.900 --> 31:19.800
I thought maybe i was
Comin' with you guys.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.600
No.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.300
Don't you have some business
To take care of at the hospital?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.100
Yeah. Bye-bye.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.300
I was a firefighter nearly all my life.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.800
18 years old when i went into the academy,

31:34.400 --> 31:36.700
So, quarters with other men,

31:37.600 --> 31:39.400
Not as close as some of you people,

31:40.700 --> 31:41.700
But pretty goddamn close,

31:42.500 --> 31:45.300
And we were committed to each other,

31:46.100 --> 31:47.700
Because our lives depended upon it.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.800
No matter what the circumstances were,

31:50.800 --> 31:52.100
We were there for each other.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.700
And if that's what this ceremony

31:54.700 --> 31:57.200
Symbolizes for my son and

31:57.200 --> 31:58.700
--and steven,

31:59.400 --> 32:01.200
Uh, well, then i'm all for it.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.500
May your commitment to each other

32:04.100 --> 32:05.300
Last you until your dying day.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.600
That's i--right over here is me.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.300
Right over there?
Yeah. Ahem.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.200
Ok.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.200
That's great. Yep. Thanks.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.300
Yep.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.800
I should, uh--oh, my god.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.900
I didn't realize. I--
I've gotta--

32:44.900 --> 32:48.600
I'm supposed to be in by 11:00.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.300
Ahem--curfew, and, uh, so i--

32:51.300 --> 32:53.200
11:00 or else.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.700
Or else what?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.900
Um, you know, i don't know,

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
'Cause i've never really missed--

33:00.000 --> 33:01.500
I've always been on time.
Oh, yeah.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.800
Since we had the baby,

33:03.200 --> 33:04.600
You know, that--
Don't wanna freak my mom out,

33:04.600 --> 33:05.100
Your mom?

33:06.700 --> 33:07.800
Did i say my mom?
Yeah.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.200
Oh, my god. What--hey.
Um, um...

33:12.200 --> 33:14.800
Um, um...

33:16.000 --> 33:17.400
Whoa, that's fast. Uh...

33:21.000 --> 33:22.900
No, i mean--it's just, you know,

33:23.700 --> 33:24.500
Are you wigging out because

33:24.500 --> 33:26.200
I carried you out of the fire?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.800
No. I'm not--
'Cause it's my job.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.400
Well, it's not really your job.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.000
I mean, you're a volunteer.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.200
And that's makin' it harder
For you, isn't it?

33:42.200 --> 33:46.100
I--i'll be completely
Hones with you.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.600
I just think it would be

33:53.300 --> 33:56.300
So much more special if we just,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.400
You know, waited.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.100
Get out of my truck.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.300
W--no, no. Really.
Get out of my truck.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.100
I'm--i'm--but i'm serious.
I mean...

34:07.500 --> 34:09.900
Yeah--are you gay?
You're gay.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.400
I'm-- i'm gay.
I'm not gay.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.500
With the guy--yeah, what--
My wife is right up the...

34:13.500 --> 34:16.300
Oh, good. Whatever, princess.
Just get out.

34:16.699 --> 34:17.600
I'll call you,

34:17.600 --> 34:20.000
But not after 11:00. I wouldn't
Wanna upset your mom.

34:21.000 --> 34:21.800
Thanks.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.600
See ya, sweetie.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.100
Thanks for making the trip,pop.

35:05.900 --> 35:06.900
It means a lot to me.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.100
Aw, me, too.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.700
Than the joint that your mother
And i had our reception at.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.600
I'm really glad you didn't book

35:16.600 --> 35:18.000
The local v.f.w.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.200
I wish mom could have come.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.400
Yeah, me, too. Uh, leastway
I would have had a date.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.500
I've already been hit on twice.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.800
The way you're lookin'these
Days,i'm not surprised.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.500
Well...

35:36.000 --> 35:37.400
She doin' ok?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Ah, no better, no worse,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.500
You know? She's happy, painting.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.800
You should really try to get
To see her a little bit more.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.800
You know, even if she doesn't know
Who the hell you are, she--

35:47.800 --> 35:49.300
She just enjoys the company,
You know?

35:49.300 --> 35:52.600
I know. It's been crazy
Planning the ceremony.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Me and steven will come down
After the honeymoon.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.700
We'll make a regular thing of

35:57.500 --> 35:58.900
Good.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.600
I love you, son.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.200
Michael. Michael.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.700
I'm sorry. She's gone.

36:55.200 --> 36:55.800
Huh?

36:56.500 --> 36:59.600
Your mom. She's passed.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Am i in trouble?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.700
Why would you be in trouble?

37:05.800 --> 37:06.900
How'd she die?

37:07.200 --> 37:09.300
Peacefully, in her sleep.

37:10.100 --> 37:10.800
Peacefully?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.400
Yeah. I'll give you
A few moments.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.600
I'm sorry i let you down,mom.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.200
I'm sorry i didn't kill you.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.200
Nice of you to finally come home.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.900
I was at work.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.100
I've been sitting here all
By myself with nobody

38:07.100 --> 38:08.300
To talk to today.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.100
You called me 6 times.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.400
You know, you could call your
Brother or your nephew if you

38:12.400 --> 38:13.700
Want someone to talk to.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.300
I can't call them.
Ellie might get to 'em.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.200
She's got ways
Of makin' people talk.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.000
Well, then go outside,
For christ's sake. Take a walk.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.500
It's cold as shit, but the fresh
Air might do you some good.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.700
I'm not really taking to
Open spaces right now.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.500
What i need is a
Schedule, you know,

38:30.500 --> 38:31.400
Like in the pen.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.400
Yeah, well,
Go home to your wife.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.100
You'll get a schedule
Up the wazoo.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.200
What?
Never!

38:35.200 --> 38:38.100
Never mention my wife
Again ever, you hear me?!

38:38.100 --> 38:39.700
Never bring her name up.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.800
Aw, jesus. I might have to
Go on a killin' spree,

38:47.700 --> 38:49.400
Get my ass locked back up again.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.000
Hey, where you going?

38:59.300 --> 39:01.300
I was just clearing a couple
Of things out of my office.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.100
You're gonna leave
Without saying good-bye?

39:03.300 --> 39:06.500

A stone's throw away.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.600

Arson shit for you.

39:10.900 --> 39:11.500
Oh. What'd you do?

39:11.500 --> 39:13.900
Well, it was still in
The preliminary stages.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
Made a phone call,
Snatched a file,

39:16.600 --> 39:18.300
Punched some keyon the computer,

39:19.200 --> 39:20.100
And problem solved.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.700
That's like a thousand-pound
Weight off my shoulders.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.900
That's great.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.000
Well, just remember i took
Care of you, tom, huh?

39:26.300 --> 39:27.600

39:27.600 --> 39:28.800

39:28.800 --> 39:31.500

Give me a hand with this?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.000

39:34.000 --> 39:35.300
I think the thing is stuck.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.500

Became an officer.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.800
Hey, hey, hey.

You were way out of line,man.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.700
You don't just come barging in to
Somebody's apartment like that.

Hadn't seen you in,

41:53.200 --> 41:54.700

The cops? I could have--

42:00.500 --> 42:03.000
