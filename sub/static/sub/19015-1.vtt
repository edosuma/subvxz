02:26.780 --> 02:28.060
Hey, get going soon.

02:32.219 --> 02:35.223
And then Ken and I
ran around the corner

02:35.522 --> 02:37.200
straight into the two
cops who just dropped...

02:37.224 --> 02:37.725
Oh, you didn't!

02:38.025 --> 02:39.504
Mm-hm.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.741
And then we were, butt-naked,
being arrested by the same two

02:44.031 --> 02:46.375
cops twice in the one night.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.667
Twice!

02:48.301 --> 02:49.301
Sorry. guys-

02:49.503 --> 02:50.680
Can I start to
clear those for you?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.842
Go ahead.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.915
So Ken's telling them
the reason we're naked

02:55.208 --> 02:57.745
and roaming the streets
is because someone broke

02:58.045 --> 03:01.049
into our house, stole
all our clothes,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.021
and we're chasing after him.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.024
And the cop says,
what did he look like?

03:06.319 --> 03:07.319
Who?

03:08.055 --> 03:09.055
Come on, keep up.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.262
The one who stole our clothes.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.832
So Ken says, fuck, mate.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.097
I didn't see him.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.174
I was too busy
banging your sister.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.180
But I was woken up
at 4:00 in the morning

03:27.441 --> 03:31.218
by the police asking if I
want to bail my husband out,

03:31.511 --> 03:32.751
and can I bring some undies?

03:34.514 --> 03:37.290
It was the best damn
funeral I've ever been to.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.029
Oh!

03:39.286 --> 03:41.686
If I got a call from the police
telling me Steve was naked...

03:41.755 --> 03:42.927
You'd be running down there!

03:43.223 --> 03:43.724
Yeah.

03:44.024 --> 03:44.593
No, no. no, no.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.460
No, I'd leave him there.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.260
You would not.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.937
I would!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.936
I have a feeling that Steve
would be A-OK with that one,

03:51.231 --> 03:52.231
eh?

03:53.767 --> 03:54.767
I'd pay for it.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.312
Quit being such a classy guy.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.541
I'm off.
Got recording in the morning.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.285
I've got
a recording in the morning.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.379
Oh, darling.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.713
Shit, where are my keys?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.498
How is the old game
show going, anyway?

04:06.613 --> 04:07.613
Great!

04:22.896 --> 04:23.465
How you doing?

04:23.764 --> 04:24.299
Jeremy.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.475
Good.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.268
Morning, Bob.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.808
Morning, Steven.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.242
Well, fuck me.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.814
Thirty minutes early.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.052
I just wanted to make sure
I'm not holding anyone up.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.522
Yeah, well, if you gave a
rat's ass every other day,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.812
I wouldn't have an ulcer
as big as Bigfoot's balls,

04:40.981 --> 04:41.981
now, would I?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.356
Now, that is gross, boss.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.185
But I still love you.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.087
See you in 30.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.352
Uh, 29.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.430
Ethan, how's my
favorite intern today?

04:49.689 --> 04:50.360
29!

04:50.657 --> 04:52.295
27!

04:52.592 --> 04:55.004
A bit wasted, actually...

04:55.295 --> 04:56.773
Hey, if that's a message
to your boyfriend,

04:56.797 --> 04:58.299
I'm going to be very jealous.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.872
I'm sending a text to my mom.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.612
Ah.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.108
Well, what kind of message do
you send to the boys, then?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.886
OK, sweetheart,
you have my number.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.655
I'd love to read
your prose sometime.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.218
You are beautiful, aren't you'?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
Oops, sorry.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.450
Welcome back
to the show, where we have

05:41.474 --> 05:44.182
Mrs. Elspeth Zonti on
, getting

05:44.477 --> 05:47.651
ready to play for the
$100,000 question.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.155
So, uh, Elspeth,
welcome to the show.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.590
What are you doing
back-Do you have a job?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.593
Yes, I decorate special

05:54.888 --> 05:56.595
and wedding cakes.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.035
Oh, so you invent
your own original designs?

05:59.059 --> 06:00.504
<i>I</i> do.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.480
What kind of
wedding cake would you bake me?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.809
Isn't she
sweet, ladies and gentlemen?

06:08.268 --> 06:09.668
Are you
thinking of getting married?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.503
I'll put it this way,

06:11.671 --> 06:13.382
you never know what disasters
the future may hold.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.718
So Elspeth, are you
ready to play for the question

06:15.742 --> 06:18.416
that could land you $100,000?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.896
Now, how can you be talking to
me and on TV at the same time?

06:32.359 --> 06:33.895
Right, the wonders
of television.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.904
Again?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.543
Can't we... can't
we just stay in?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.540
All right.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.282
Yup.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.282
OK.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.578
Steve.

06:56.616 --> 06:57.822
Nothing.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.825
It's all right.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.120
Bye.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.640
We'll be right back!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.312
What's the specials tonight?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.281
Ah, tonight we have a filet.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.148
It comes with, stuffed

07:20.440 --> 07:23.148
with caviar, a sour cream
sauce, and roasted capers.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.753
Well, that sounds
like it's for me.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.754
Alex, what would you like?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.255
Isn't there something simple?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.588
Ah, well, there's the
baby lamb sir.

07:32.852 --> 07:37.995
It comes with the avanti
blanc and the jus de poire.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.271
What is that'?

07:40.527 --> 07:41.567
It's a bit like a hot pot.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.795
Right.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.303
That'll do.

07:44.597 --> 07:45.975
And... and the usual oysters
to start with, shall we?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
Oysters'?
- Yeah.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.133
Frisky.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.778
You know, we could eat
at home if we ate at home.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.386
That makes no sense.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.124
Have you noticed we
don't have a home?

08:01.381 --> 08:03.554
What we have is a
pleasure wonderland.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.295
Pleasure wonderland?

08:05.552 --> 08:06.696
What are you
talking about, Alex?

08:06.720 --> 08:07.720
We have a beautiful home.

08:07.787 --> 08:11.496
It's an apartment, not a home.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.702
We're building a beautiful
house on the beach.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.567
Yeah, I know we're building,
Steve, but... thanks.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.048
Look, I know we're building.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.141
But how does that make
this different than how

08:30.310 --> 08:32.722
we're living now?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.013
Why?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.049
You want to nest?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.991
Yes.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.701
Yeah, I want to nest.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.267
Well, you know, I want a nest.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.698
Don't you?

08:48.995 --> 08:50.506
Nesting sounds so
old and boring, Alex.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.174
I'm not talking about
wearing matching track suits

08:52.198 --> 08:53.768
and watching "M A S H" all day.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.177
I'm talking about
having a home...

08:55.201 --> 08:56.407
I like "M A S H."

08:56.703 --> 08:59.843
I'm talking about
having a home, OK?

09:00.106 --> 09:02.609
Like a proper home, and
actually living in it.

09:04.010 --> 09:04.545
What?

09:04.844 --> 09:05.515
Nothing.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.622
What?

09:09.215 --> 09:09.886
Don't panic.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.183
Fuck it.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.228
I have to keep the fans happy.

09:12.252 --> 09:12.889
Shit.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.688
Hey, girls!

09:14.954 --> 09:15.591
Aren't they sweet?

09:15.889 --> 09:16.889
Yeah.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.196
Too funny.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.098
Fuck off.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.395
Don't be like that.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.977
Can we please get
the fuck out of here?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.513
What do you mean,
go somewhere else?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.949
No, I mean-I mean go home.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.784
It's not our home, Alex.
It's an apartment.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.151
Oh, come on.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.616
You know what I mean, just
get a movie, get some Thai.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.550
Just you and me at our place?

09:40.814 --> 09:41.854
Look, what's the problem'?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.258
I want more, Steve.

09:47.554 --> 09:48.589
All right?

09:48.888 --> 09:50.232
I want to feel like
that we're a family

09:50.256 --> 09:51.901
and that we're not just
fucking around here.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.969
We're building a house from
the ground up on the beach.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.393
Now, that seems...
- Yeah, I want...

09:55.462 --> 09:56.099
a little bit more
than fucking around to me,

09:56.396 --> 09:56.965
don't you think, Alex?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.640
I want something real.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.076
Well, this is not going to
be made out of fucking LEGOs.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.380
Not just about the house, Steve.

10:01.501 --> 10:06.177
Well, what the... what
the fuck is it about?

10:06.473 --> 10:06.974
Huh?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.273
You tell me.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.322
Waiter.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.690
Would you like a drink?

10:21.988 --> 10:24.662
No.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.078
Two glasses of wine, please.

10:26.192 --> 10:26.829
Red.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.127
One.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.294
Can you get me a bottle?

10:31.865 --> 10:34.641
Hey, you want to
watch something?

10:34.934 --> 10:35.639
No.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.935
I'll leave it to you.

11:23.216 --> 11:23.819
Well, good morning.

11:24.083 --> 11:24.823
Good morning.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.204
Are we ready to get excited?

11:26.252 --> 11:29.096
If you're offering.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.596
Whoo-hoo!

11:31.891 --> 11:33.336
We found the ideal site.

11:33.593 --> 11:34.593
Where?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.038
- Down by Ocean Grove.
- Coffee time!

11:36.062 --> 11:36.665
- Ocean Grove?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

11:36.930 --> 11:37.533
What's wrong with that?

11:37.830 --> 11:39.571
Well, it's his money.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.936
Uh, here we go.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.679
Cafe latte for you.

11:42.936 --> 11:43.936
Thank you.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.574
And a flat white for you, sir.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.181
Thank you, sir.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.052
Now, there's... there's
something I really want.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.521
Ah, the S&M room.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.923
All black, leather harness,
porn, mirrors on the ceiling.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.227
Oh yeah, that's... that's funny.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.521
No, I'm being serious.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.127
OK, we're listening.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.421
I want a nursery.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.865
<i>- Um...</i>
- He means a.

12:02.889 --> 12:03.458
No, no, no.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.293
No, I mean a nursery.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.593
Yeah?
- Yeah, easy.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.627
Easy.

12:08.695 --> 12:09.230
Everyone should have a nursery.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.200
Um, yeah.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.463
<i>Uh' easy, easy.</i>

12:11.631 --> 12:13.076
Look, um, yeah, we
could... we could

12:13.366 --> 12:16.609
put one here, on the south side,
overlooking the herb garden.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.343
You get that... that
morning light...

12:18.538 --> 12:19.243
Morning sun, yeah.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, beautiful.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.952
With its own bathroom here here,
and some sort of... um-can

12:22.976 --> 12:24.220
you put in a rec
room, like there?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.314
Um, well, yeah.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.855
I mean, you see the overhang.
- Yeah.

12:26.879 --> 12:27.584
If we knock that down...

12:27.880 --> 12:29.052
Whoa, hey. guys-

12:29.315 --> 12:30.526
We should think
about this before we

12:30.550 --> 12:31.756
start knocking down walls.

12:32.051 --> 12:34.258
Don't you think, Alex?

12:37.991 --> 12:39.470
Mm, oh, shit, actually.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.599
I've got another meeting
in about half an hour.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.733
So I'd better, um, take off.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.410
I will be free all day
tomorrow, Steven, so, um,

12:47.667 --> 12:48.811
give me a buzz, all right?
- Thanks

12:48.835 --> 12:49.835
See you later.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.699
Was I supposed to know?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.230
When were you going to tell me?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.295
OK.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.636
How would you feel,
right, about expanding this?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.319
A baby?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.796
Yes, a baby.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.336
Alex, are you out
of your fucking mind?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.839
What, do you want
to get me pregnant?

13:50.863 --> 13:51.898
Come on, Steve...

13:52.198 --> 13:53.475
Do... do you want me
to get you pregnant?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.710
Alex, it doesn't fucking work...

13:54.734 --> 13:55.734
I want a family.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.178
I want to be a family.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.950
You know, why shouldn't
we bring up a child?

14:01.974 --> 14:03.654
It's not a question
of should or shouldn't.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.553
It's a question of can or can't.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.416
And I... we can't conceive.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.755
So that leaves one other
thing, and that's adoption.

14:10.917 --> 14:11.588
Society is changing.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.022
Well, laws aren't!

14:13.319 --> 14:14.997
Yeah, but Steve, we're...
We're two responsible

14:15.021 --> 14:16.101
people with great income...

14:16.356 --> 14:17.833
I know it's fucked,
Alex, but that still

14:17.857 --> 14:19.468
doesn't change the fact
that they only give

14:19.492 --> 14:21.870
babies to husbands and wives.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.368
And how do we prove anything
about our relationship?

14:24.664 --> 14:27.201
I mean, it will be years before
they change their laws-years.

14:32.338 --> 14:37.378
I'd give up anything, anything.

14:37.677 --> 14:41.056
I'd give up my job if I had to.

14:41.347 --> 14:44.055
I want to be a dad, you know?

14:46.753 --> 14:47.753
I'm ready.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.732
This would change everything.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.403
Hey, hey.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.695
I know.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.401
But you need to
make an appointment

15:01.701 --> 15:03.912
to see a consultant, and of
course, to bring your partners.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.244
We are a couple.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.915
Yes, but you need to bring
your partners, of course.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.219
The consultant
won't see singles,

15:08.408 --> 15:09.887
and your partners
will need to bring

15:10.143 --> 15:13.124
proof of the relationship,
be it marriage or de facto.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.825
We take wedding certificates,
bank records, things like that.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.555
Yeah, I don't think
you understand...

15:17.650 --> 15:19.361
We'll also need proof of
entitlement, meaning wills,

15:19.385 --> 15:22.559
so in the event of your death,
your wife will get the car,

15:22.822 --> 15:23.822
boat, house, et cetera.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.560
Superannuation statement showing

15:25.825 --> 15:28.999
benefactor, life insurance
policy showing benefactor.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.002
So if you just want to
read over the books,

15:31.297 --> 15:33.504
you know, it's got
all the info there.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.972
Uh, let me explain.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.068
I'm... all right-I'm
Alex Thomson, and this...

15:37.270 --> 15:38.476
This is Steven Evans.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.478
On!

15:40.773 --> 15:42.446
I knew I'd seen you before!

15:42.742 --> 15:44.415
You're on TV.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.658
Steven Evans, "Guess What."

15:47.947 --> 15:49.085
Yes, that's right.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.959
So you and your partner...
Is it your wife...

15:50.983 --> 15:52.326
You want an adoption.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.121
Well, we could find you a
foster child straight away,

15:55.421 --> 15:57.128
but adoption's a
long, long wait.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.630
We can, of course, arrange
an IVF consultation...

15:59.926 --> 16:00.966
No, no, nothing like that.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.193
No, I didn't think you would.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.366
No.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.769
Look, I'll tell you what.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.674
I can, um, squeeze
you in first thing

16:10.970 --> 16:12.677
Friday morning with Dr. Zekey.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.416
Have you heard of Dr. Zekey?
I haven't...

16:14.440 --> 16:15.145
"Zee-kee."

16:15.441 --> 16:17.148
He's very good.

16:17.443 --> 16:21.118
This application, it... it's
quite confidential, isn't it?

16:21.380 --> 16:22.120
Oh. yes!

16:22.381 --> 16:23.485
I mean, the media's so...

16:23.783 --> 16:24.284
Intrusive?

16:24.550 --> 16:25.550
Of course!

16:25.618 --> 16:27.291
Look, it's totally confidential.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.191
No need to make an
appointment just yet.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.809
Hey, hey, hey...
How about... why?

16:30.857 --> 16:32.632
Why can't we make an
appointment just yet?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.892
Well, it's really more for
my friend here, you see.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.203
Friend?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.706
Friend?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.207
Yeah, I'm his friend.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.915
What's wrong?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.415
Nothing.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.884
I just can't sleep.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.557
Why don't you come back to bed?

17:29.849 --> 17:30.350
I told you.

17:30.616 --> 17:31.616
I can't sleep.

17:36.522 --> 17:37.796
What the fuck?

17:38.090 --> 17:39.398
What?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.270
There's someone taking
photos of me, of the building.

17:41.294 --> 17:41.897
What?

17:42.194 --> 17:43.298
Yeah, look, right there.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.301
There's someone taking photos.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.302
Alex, just stay here.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.598
I'll go.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.075
Hey!

17:53.372 --> 17:54.683
What are you doing,
you fucking creep?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.227
Fuck you, I'm not
doing anything wrong.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.519
Why are you running
away for, then?

17:57.543 --> 17:58.543
Huh?
'FUCK you!

18:02.448 --> 18:04.257
Fuck it.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.102
What?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.744
Well, here
we are, building-building a...

18:33.946 --> 18:34.946
Oh, can you behave?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.252
Can you actually
walk normal, please?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.062
Excuse me.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.441
Excuse me, what...
What's your name?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.170
- Uh, Brett.
- Brett?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.171
All right.
I'm Alex.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.502
How are you doing?
- Good.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.321
How's it all going?

18:57.536 --> 18:59.414
Like, how far away do you think
we are from... from moving in?

18:59.438 --> 19:02.146
Eh, right now,
almost for lock up, so...

19:02.441 --> 19:03.476
Yep.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.376
Your feet... you've
got very nice calves.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.089
Is it... do you...

19:07.113 --> 19:08.290
- Are you serious?
- No, you do!

19:08.314 --> 19:09.491
Are you commenting on my calves?

19:09.515 --> 19:09.959
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:10.216 --> 19:10.694
You do.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.761
I mean, I'm just-— I'm just
saying, like you must...

19:12.785 --> 19:14.930
Do you work out outside this, or
is this sort of the job that...

19:14.954 --> 19:16.160
Uh, I play footy, so...

19:16.455 --> 19:16.830
Oh, you play football?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.158
Yeah, yeah.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.935
With lots of guys...

19:19.959 --> 19:20.562
This our view.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.964
Our view.

19:22.228 --> 19:22.865
It's a good spot.

19:23.162 --> 19:23.799
It's a great spot.

19:24.063 --> 19:24.700
Wait, what do I say...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.067
You head's in the way.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.036
Listen, Ocean Grove
will be a great spot.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.403
You were right.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.112
Come on, say something.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.377
Come on, this is, uh...
This is your project.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.192
Come on, tell us a
little bit about it.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.451
For developing these plans,
we thank you for doing this,

19:36.475 --> 19:37.555
because we couldn't have...

19:37.743 --> 19:39.121
Thank you guys for
paying me so much...

19:39.145 --> 19:40.822
Kiss... kiss the camera.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.524
I've grossly overcharged you...
I'm not kissing the camera.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.151
Tell us
how much you love this project

19:43.416 --> 19:44.656
by kissing the camera.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.158
We want to see commitment!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.525
OK, all right!

19:57.697 --> 20:01.770
Alex, you're going to have to
design those bathrooms quickly.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.105
One in white, and
one pink for the baby.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.541
Alex!

20:05.838 --> 20:07.545
You know how my
designs are in demand.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.910
Originality...

20:09.208 --> 20:10.652
And imagination linked
with practicability.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.746
Yeah, yeah.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.354
Yeah, this is nothing
to do with design.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.456
It's to do with
legality and gender.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.626
Yeah, well, our
gender is our design,

20:18.918 --> 20:20.522
and we have a design problem.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.459
Look, all we have to
do is find some way

20:22.755 --> 20:24.433
to make our money more
important to these people

20:24.457 --> 20:25.197
than our design.
- What'!

20:25.458 --> 20:26.459
Yeah.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.103
You want to bribe
the adoption agency?

20:28.127 --> 20:31.131
Well, I want to make
it worth their while.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.137
This isn't fucking
television, Alex!

20:33.432 --> 20:34.968
You-— you can't
offer them a price

20:35.267 --> 20:36.769
and expect to make a deal.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.547
And have you even
thought whether or not

20:38.571 --> 20:39.571
you'll love the baby?

20:39.772 --> 20:40.916
Of course I'll love
the baby, Steve.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.419
- Will you?
- Yes.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.120
You... you expect just to look
at a baby and say, I love you?

20:45.411 --> 20:46.822
Yes.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.623
Because I don't think I could
do that, just look at a baby

20:48.647 --> 20:51.821
and go, I love you,
you're my child.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.791
You're being fucking ridiculous!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.526
No amount of money
is going to change

20:55.755 --> 20:58.759
the fact that officially and
legally, we're not a couple.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.343
Listen, I told Ajay
you're a solid worker

21:16.642 --> 21:19.816
and that he should move
you up the ranks a little.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.113
Really?

21:21.413 --> 21:22.790
Yeah, of course, really.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.028
I told you I'd look after you.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.677
It's not going to
happen overnight.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.959
It may take a little
while to get moving.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.256
But I'm onto it.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.186
Now get the fuck out of here.

21:40.499 --> 21:41.499
Go on.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.485
Come on, slow poke.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.726
Oh, shut up.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.022
Mr. Competition.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.290
Nice running style.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.491
Shut up!

22:15.568 --> 22:16.808
What's that?

22:17.069 --> 22:17.706
Nothing.

22:18.003 --> 22:18.640
Give us a look.

22:18.904 --> 22:19.405
Nothing.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.083
Give... give it here.

22:22.374 --> 22:24.452
" If you're interested in the
family, but can't conceive,

22:24.476 --> 22:27.480
call Nancy at Dreamland.com."

22:27.746 --> 22:29.157
Well, that sounds about
right, doesn't it?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.319
Dreamland.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.160
You know, babies
manufactured to your choice,

22:32.184 --> 22:33.663
just pay us a billion dollars.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.330
No, no, no, look, she wants to
put up her baby for adoption.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.832
She's flogging her baby
on the internet, Alex.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.096
Oh, just give it to me.

22:38.390 --> 22:39.901
She wants to put up her
baby for adoption privately.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.203
- Don't sugarcoat it.
- I'm not sugarcoating anything!

22:41.227 --> 22:42.787
It's either that or
it's a fucking scam.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.507
Will you just try this with me?

22:44.763 --> 22:45.764
Alex, it won't work.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.065
It won't work'?

22:47.199 --> 22:47.700
No.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.377
Oh, it won't work?

22:49.668 --> 22:51.375
All right, well
then, prove it to me.

22:51.670 --> 22:56.278
Prove to me this won't work,
because I'm ready for this.

22:56.575 --> 22:57.110
Fine.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.547
Fine?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.881
But when this doesn't
work, you agree to stop.

23:01.180 --> 23:01.715
All right?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.357
This is it.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.119
If... if this doesn't
work, then we're done.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.193
We tried our best,
but it's over.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.023
Agreed?

23:09.288 --> 23:10.288
- If?
- If.

23:10.522 --> 23:11.522
If.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.080
She's late.

23:28.374 --> 23:31.287
It's only three minutes, she
may have got the wrong place.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.592
Do you think that was her?

23:38.884 --> 23:40.629
No, she doesn't have a
dog with her, does she?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.053
No, she doesn't
have a dog with her,

23:42.154 --> 23:43.874
but she doesn't have a
baby with her either.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.774
Look, I... I don't think
she's going to show, Alex.

23:52.798 --> 23:54.106
Fuck it, let's go.
- No!

23:54.400 --> 23:54.935
No, I'm staying.

23:55.234 --> 23:55.735
All right.

23:56.001 --> 23:56.672
You stay, I'm going.

23:56.969 --> 23:57.969
Steve, just...

24:00.806 --> 24:01.806
Excuse me?

24:02.007 --> 24:03.007
Yes?

24:03.275 --> 24:05.482
I'm looking for a
little white dog.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.951
A dog-dog?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.921
Yeah, a little white dog.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.183
Are you Nancy, or...?

24:12.351 --> 24:12.988
Yeah.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.696
Where's your partner?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.593
Uh, she couldn't make it, but
I brought a friend instead.

24:17.856 --> 24:18.425
This is...

24:18.691 --> 24:19.192
Hi, I'm Chris.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.437
Yeah.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.866
What-uh, wait, please!

24:23.162 --> 24:24.239
- I've got to go.
- Wait, wait.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.674
Please, please, please!

24:25.965 --> 24:27.309
Where's... where's your wife,
or your girlfriend, or whatever?

24:27.333 --> 24:30.314
Look, let's just sit
down and have a coffee.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.180
Look, it's a bit...
It's a bit complicated,

24:32.204 --> 24:34.684
but I'll explain everything.

24:34.974 --> 24:35.475
Please.

24:35.774 --> 24:36.445
OK.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.709
But I can't stay long.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.016
I've got to get to.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.452
I'll explain everything.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.856
I've really got to go,
because I've got to get to...

24:41.880 --> 24:43.223
That's OK, that's OK.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.722
Look, um... Chris is...

24:46.018 --> 24:46.723
I'm his partner.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.999
Yeah.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.288
Look... no!

24:50.389 --> 24:51.499
Please, please, just sit down.

24:51.523 --> 24:52.523
Please just listen.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.737
One minute, one coffee.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.062
OK'?

24:56.362 --> 24:57.806
I've really got to get more,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.110
they can't get me
in before 4:00.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.003
All right, all right.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.299
Um, I'll get the coffees.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.444
Cappuccino, latte, macchiato-

25:02.468 --> 25:03.173
Hot chocolate?

25:03.469 --> 25:03.970
Long black, short black?

25:04.236 --> 25:05.977
What will it be?

25:06.238 --> 25:08.980
A scone.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.686
A scone?

25:10.976 --> 25:11.976
Two scones.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.385
All right, two scones.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.681
Thanks.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.756
Please, sit.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.038
Must be great to have a baby.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.906
I haven't got it yet.

25:39.204 --> 25:44.210
Oh, she's... she's
away, or... something?

25:44.510 --> 25:46.183
No, you just can't
see it, not yet.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.052
Why?

25:50.349 --> 25:54.388
I'm pregnant.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.255
Pregnant?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.589
Yeah.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.897
Pregnant.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.708
I just-I don't understand.

26:13.972 --> 26:14.575
I mean...

26:14.873 --> 26:15.578
- What, why?
- Why?

26:15.874 --> 26:16.375
Why. why...

26:16.642 --> 26:17.382
Yes.

26:17.643 --> 26:18.383
Why I put the ad up?

26:18.644 --> 26:20.885
Yes.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.217
Why I wanted to sell it'?

26:29.555 --> 26:31.555
'Cause I've got no money
and nowhere to fucking go,

26:31.623 --> 26:32.623
that's why.

26:42.634 --> 26:45.410
So I could sell it lo...
A nice couple, you know.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.275
And you seemed pretty cool.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.915
And I get here, and all I
find is a... a couple of fags.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.487
Yeah, all right.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.486
OK, look.

26:56.782 --> 26:57.988
Nancy?

26:58.283 --> 27:04.996
Nancy, we can help you, OK'?

27:05.290 --> 27:07.998
With-with the birth,
with the pregnancy.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.499
All of it.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.935
Other people have contacted
me, straight people.

27:13.198 --> 27:14.358
Yeah, I... I understand that.

27:14.633 --> 27:19.776
But we can help you.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.712
It'll cost money, you know.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.008
I'm not donating.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.209
Of course.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.693
I have to think about it.

27:33.986 --> 27:34.987
I've got to go.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.807
Chris will be back
in a... in a minute.

27:36.989 --> 27:37.626
I'll contact you.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.527
He'll...

27:38.824 --> 27:39.393
I'll give you a call.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.691
Nancy...

27:54.740 --> 27:58.984
Alex, you're stressing
me out about this.

27:59.244 --> 27:59.915
I can't talk now.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.486
I'm at work.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.427
Look, I'll give you a
call on the way home.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.050
OK.

28:04.349 --> 28:04.884
All right, bye.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.527
I love you, too.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.663
Sounds like someone's got
you on a short leash there.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.688
<i>Hey, Ajay!-</i>

28:09.988 --> 28:11.308
It's not very
often that we see...

28:11.356 --> 28:12.834
Now, listen, Steven,
I want to talk to you

28:12.858 --> 28:13.902
about some rumors
that are flying

28:13.926 --> 28:15.126
around upstairs at the moment.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.538
Has someone said they're
having my love child...

28:16.562 --> 28:18.007
No, no.

28:18.263 --> 28:20.308
There's a lot of talk going
around about you sucking cock.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.572
Sucking cock?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.711
Normally, I don't listen
to the shit that gets thrown

28:23.735 --> 28:25.180
around upstairs,
but these rumors are

28:25.437 --> 28:26.882
filtering up from the bottom.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.516
And when they come from below,
you know, I tend to listen.

28:29.775 --> 28:31.379
Nobody knows dirt
like the plebs.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.712
Well, who's saying it?

28:33.011 --> 28:34.322
Well, I don't want
to be saying anything.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.223
Now, I don't give a
shit where you stick

28:36.515 --> 28:38.222
your cock in your spare time.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.188
You want to go dirt track?

28:39.451 --> 28:40.691
That's your business.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.126
But my business is this
show, and our demographic

28:43.422 --> 28:45.462
is the nanas and the fat
old housewives that tune in

28:45.557 --> 28:47.400
everyday to watch
your pretty little mug

28:47.693 --> 28:49.536
smiling back at
her so they can get

28:49.795 --> 28:52.469
all sopping wet in their seats.

28:52.764 --> 28:56.735
Steven, no one is going
to tune in to watch

28:57.035 --> 28:58.309
a fag give away prizes.

28:58.604 --> 29:02.711
Even for SBS, this
is prime time, mate.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.750
Mate, I'm prime time.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.716
Good!

29:06.979 --> 29:08.652
Good.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.267
Then I'll go and tell the rumor
mill to go and fuck itself.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.088
Yeah, do that.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.761
You know what?

29:14.052 --> 29:15.763
They're just jealous that I
get more pussy than they do.

29:15.787 --> 29:16.959
Get pussy?

29:17.256 --> 29:21.636
You watch, they'll start
calling me Elton John.

29:21.927 --> 29:22.927
Hey, Elton!

29:31.570 --> 29:33.914
Fuck.

29:36.174 --> 29:38.347
Who the fuck would be talking?

29:38.644 --> 29:39.816
It's bound to happen, Steve.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.285
You're on TV, people say shit.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.754
But they'd be saying it
even if you were straight.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.691
Everyone has a G-A-Y
scandal at times...

29:47.986 --> 29:50.159
Yeah, but I am!

29:50.455 --> 29:51.160
That's the problem.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.127
Hey!

29:52.424 --> 29:55.098
Hey, that's not a problem.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.533
The studio doesn't want
a fag as a host, Alex.

29:57.829 --> 29:58.829
Oh, don't say that word!

29:59.097 --> 29:59.802
Oh, well, how is
"unemployed" for a word?

30:00.098 --> 30:01.270
You like that?

30:01.533 --> 30:02.273
They're not going to
fire you for sucking cock.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.614
Oh, no, they won't fire me.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.169
They'll just replace
me, won't they?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.914
Yeah, well, then you
shouldn't be working for them.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.645
I like my job.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.386
I like what I do,
and I like who I am.

30:11.677 --> 30:12.280
Really?

30:12.544 --> 30:13.545
Yeah.

30:13.845 --> 30:14.516
Who are you?

30:14.813 --> 30:15.813
Steven Evans.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.152
I took on this job
knowing full well

30:20.452 --> 30:21.863
the studio doesn't
want a faggot host...

30:21.887 --> 30:22.388
Don't say that word!

30:22.688 --> 30:24.167
Oh, fuck the word!

30:24.456 --> 30:26.136
This is my career we're
talking about here.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.339
You do like sucking cock.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.598
Oh, that's all right,
I've got this one.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.172
Here you are, Steven.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.378
So how's your day been?

31:09.668 --> 31:10.840
Shit.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.014
Ah.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.842
Why's it been shit?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.108
Just a shit day, Charlie.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.689
Well, if there's anything
I can do to make it better,

31:21.713 --> 31:22.919
all you have to do is ask.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.353
That I will, Charlie.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.458
That I Will.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.765
Well, what are we
celebrating here?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.918
Nancy.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.211
Nancy?

31:54.279 --> 31:56.919
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.388
She contacted me.

31:59.651 --> 32:00.651
She wants to meet us.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.054
Great.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.258
When?

32:10.095 --> 32:13.269
Don't know yet.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.426
Look, Nancy, we'll
look after you.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.685
OK'?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.240
We'll get you
everything you need.

32:36.354 --> 32:37.565
And you're free to change
of mind if you want.

32:37.589 --> 32:38.158
No strings attached.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.457
No strings attached?

32:39.491 --> 32:42.665
No strings attached.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.321
Like I said, I've
had other offers.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.499
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.008
But we... we'll match
them, we'll double them.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.842
Within reason, of course.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.843
Your partner creeps me out.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.515
He doesn't say much.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.185
He's just the silent time,
but he wants this just as much

32:58.477 --> 32:59.477
HS me.

32:59.711 --> 33:00.849
Yeah.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.146
Don't you, Chris?

33:05.350 --> 33:06.624
Chris!

33:06.885 --> 33:09.126
Yes, of course.

33:09.387 --> 33:09.956
And he means it.

33:10.222 --> 33:10.893
He means it.

33:11.189 --> 33:12.497
You know, we both do.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.567
We just... we just want to
know that you're for real.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.861
Look, I know you haven't
known us that long, Nancy,

33:17.996 --> 33:18.667
but you can...

33:18.964 --> 33:19.635
It's Nerine.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.036
What?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.745
My name's Nerine, not Nancy.

33:24.035 --> 33:26.195
I just didn't want to use my
real name on the internet.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.856
Look, Nerine, we can help you.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.856
I don't want this baby.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.263
I just want cash, OK?

33:42.554 --> 33:45.034
Cash.

33:45.323 --> 33:48.566
I just want to forget
about the whole thing.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.340
Look, Nerine, I want
to give you something

33:51.596 --> 33:52.836
to show you that we're serious.

33:52.898 --> 33:53.898
Yeah?

33:59.771 --> 34:00.943
Will you just her the cash?

34:03.842 --> 34:04.842
Please.

34:11.917 --> 34:12.917
This is just as a start.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.021
OK'?

34:20.725 --> 34:21.725
I need to go pee.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.366
What?

34:48.620 --> 34:49.940
She's probably
going to run, Alex.

34:50.088 --> 34:50.589
Fucking hell!

34:50.889 --> 34:52.094
She's in the toilet!

34:52.389 --> 34:53.994
She's probably
not even pregnant.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.829
Have you thought about
the father... HIV/AIDS?

34:57.128 --> 34:57.663
Who the fuck knows what?

34:57.963 --> 34:58.668
I want this one.

34:58.964 --> 35:00.041
You're living in a dream world.

35:00.065 --> 35:00.634
Yeah?

35:00.932 --> 35:01.932
Well, I like it there.

35:32.697 --> 35:33.697
All right.

35:36.835 --> 35:37.835
You can have it.

35:49.114 --> 35:52.391
There you go.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.684
Holy shit!

35:54.486 --> 35:55.829
It's fucking big!

35:56.121 --> 35:57.281
How many bedrooms has it got?

35:57.522 --> 35:58.967
Four.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.268
There's a special one for the
baby, with its own bathroom.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.332
What the fuck does a baby
need its own bathroom for?

36:03.528 --> 36:07.408
So when they get older, they
can have their own space.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.804
It's a load more
than I got as a kid.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.513
We just wanted to
make sure the baby

36:11.803 --> 36:12.508
had everything it could want.

36:12.804 --> 36:13.509
Exactly.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.512
Spoiled if you ask me.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.016
Hey, you could help
design the nursery.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.516
Yeah, you know?

36:20.812 --> 36:22.189
You could choose the...
The colors, or the drapes,

36:22.213 --> 36:23.988
or one of those mobile
things above the cot?

36:24.249 --> 36:24.989
No, you do it.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.250
I'll do it.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.233
Guys, come on!

36:33.525 --> 36:35.436
The beach is waiting.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.727
Come on!

37:23.441 --> 37:26.752
Alex, I thought
you might want this.

37:29.614 --> 37:30.614
And this.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.118
And this.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.737
Nerine... Nerine,
it's... it's beautiful!

37:44.996 --> 37:45.736
I think it's ugly.

37:45.997 --> 37:46.737
Looks like an alien.

37:46.998 --> 37:47.998
But it's your baby!

37:53.938 --> 37:57.408
It's not my baby, Alex.

37:57.675 --> 37:58.176
It's yours.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.476
It's just in me.

38:03.414 --> 38:11.414
Are you sure
you don't want these?

38:18.096 --> 38:19.096
I'm sure.

38:27.372 --> 38:28.372
I don't want this.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.658
Where is a good restaurant?

38:47.859 --> 38:49.668
The menu, please.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.171
I'm heading off.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.844
OK.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.136
See you later.

39:05.376 --> 39:12.988
I like my steak well done.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.832
Yeah... yeah, I'll be home soon.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.561
I just have to stay back
and have a chat with Bob,

39:23.862 --> 39:24.862
and I'll be out of here.

39:29.334 --> 39:30.711
OK.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.002
Bye.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.279
Fucking babies.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.261
What's cooking, good looking?

39:52.557 --> 39:53.968
I don't cook.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.259
Jump in.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.787
What a shame, it looks
like there's no one around.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.755
No audience for Mr. TV Man.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.997
Good.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.254
Good.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.667
Well, having people watch
is half the fun, isn't it?

40:29.961 --> 40:31.065
No, no.

40:31.329 --> 40:35.243
I spend all my life in
front of the camera.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.174
You've got to have
something for yourself.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.189
I think I'd love to
spend some time in front

40:40.271 --> 40:43.252
of the camera with you.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.263
Who knows, maybe you could
find yourself a new career?

40:47.512 --> 40:52.427
Ah, there are limits, my friend.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.958
Charlie, there are limits.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.629
Oh, I don't have any limits.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.332
You're about to find that out.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.931
Here we are.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.636
Is this good enough?

41:01.926 --> 41:03.046
Oh, this looks very naughty!

41:24.515 --> 41:25.515
Well?

41:37.161 --> 41:41.701
Keep on
going! Oh!

41:42.000 --> 41:42.637
Oh, fuck!

41:42.900 --> 41:44.641
Oh!

41:48.539 --> 41:50.075
Yeah, yeah.

41:50.375 --> 41:50.876
Keep going?

41:51.175 --> 41:51.676
Yeah, yeah.

41:51.976 --> 41:52.976
Oh, fuck.
Oh!

41:53.044 --> 41:54.044
Oh!

41:57.682 --> 41:58.854
Oh, fuck!

41:59.150 --> 41:59.855
The fuck?

42:00.151 --> 42:00.856
Get the fuck out of here!

42:01.152 --> 42:01.823
Oh, shit!

42:02.086 --> 42:04.259
Fuck off!

42:04.555 --> 42:06.728
Fuck off!

42:08.726 --> 42:09.227
What the fuck...

42:09.527 --> 42:10.699
All right, let's go.

42:10.995 --> 42:11.666
What the fuck...

42:11.929 --> 42:13.408
Fucking belts.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.700
Let's get out of here.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.501
Fuck.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.271
Oh, fuck.

42:19.570 --> 42:20.570
You all right'?

42:20.605 --> 42:21.605
Yeah.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.551
You'll have to walk from here.

42:28.846 --> 42:29.881
Yeah, cool.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.626
You know, you
should, um... you call

42:35.920 --> 42:38.764
me, or text me, or something,
if you want to do this again.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.764
Great.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.039
Now, listen, Charlie,
you're not going to mention

42:43.294 --> 42:44.294
this to anyone, are you?

42:44.395 --> 42:46.534
No.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.038
What do you think I am, stupid?

42:48.266 --> 42:49.609
I'm serious.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.101
You just keep your mouth shut.

42:54.605 --> 42:55.811
Well, most of the time anyway.

43:03.481 --> 43:04.481
See you later, Chuck.

43:18.396 --> 43:20.171
Fuck!

43:20.465 --> 43:21.465
What are you doing?

43:21.666 --> 43:22.666
What are you doing?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.616
Shit!

43:54.699 --> 43:57.145
Hello?

43:57.435 --> 43:59.108
Nerine?

43:59.370 --> 44:00.713
What-we're on our way.

44:04.609 --> 44:06.452
Uh, Nerine, she was
admitted... she's pregnant.

44:06.711 --> 44:07.212
Birthing.

44:07.512 --> 44:08.149
She's birthing?

44:08.446 --> 44:09.151
Fuck... having a baby?

44:09.447 --> 44:10.016
Where is she?

44:10.314 --> 44:11.452
Who... who are you after'?

44:11.716 --> 44:12.716
Nerine.

44:12.950 --> 44:13.451
Surname?

44:13.718 --> 44:14.718
Evans.

44:21.492 --> 44:24.530
Mm, no Evans.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.106
Nerine... Nerine,
that's all I know.

44:26.130 --> 44:27.130
Nerine!

44:33.137 --> 44:37.347
Mm, ooh, here we are.

44:37.642 --> 44:39.212
Nerine Thomson.

44:39.510 --> 44:42.548
She's in delivery room B. It's
straight down the corridor,

44:42.847 --> 44:44.167
follow the blue
line to your left.

44:44.415 --> 44:45.018
Great!

44:45.316 --> 44:46.420
Uh... just the father.

44:46.717 --> 44:49.425
Is... are you the father?

44:49.720 --> 44:50.994
Yeah, yes.
Yes, he is.

44:51.255 --> 44:52.966
Well, I'm afraid you're
going to have to wait here.

44:52.990 --> 44:53.661
Wait, what?

44:53.925 --> 44:55.165
He's family!

44:55.426 --> 44:57.266
I'm her brother-I'm
her half brother, her only

44:57.361 --> 44:58.521
living relative, you can't...

44:58.729 --> 44:59.867
You can see her later.

45:00.164 --> 45:00.835
Steve!

45:01.098 --> 45:02.270
Alex, I've got to go.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.111
Hey, OK'?

45:09.407 --> 45:10.407
<i>It'll be OK.</i>

45:43.741 --> 45:45.953
Dr. Kelly,
prepare clinical operations

45:46.777 --> 45:47.777
Dr. Kelly.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.769
Daddy, you've got a baby boy.

46:46.704 --> 46:47.341
Oh, there you go!

46:47.638 --> 46:48.309
There he is!

46:48.606 --> 46:49.812
Hello!

47:00.985 --> 47:03.989
He's going to be a surfer
when he grows up, Alex.

47:04.288 --> 47:05.288
Yeah?

48:29.874 --> 48:30.477
Steve.

48:30.775 --> 48:31.276
Yeah?

48:31.575 --> 48:32.610
Listen to this.

48:32.910 --> 48:36.653
It's to the general
manager at the firm.

48:36.947 --> 48:39.291
Dear Richard, some
time ago, I attended

48:39.583 --> 48:41.153
a seminar where an
executive from London

48:41.452 --> 48:42.795
had a look at my work.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.590
He'd since contacted me and
offered me a great position

48:45.890 --> 48:46.595
with his firm...

48:46.891 --> 48:48.666
"He's," not "he'd-" "He's."

48:48.959 --> 48:49.494
"He's since?"

48:49.794 --> 48:50.794
Yeah.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.266
OK.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.068
He's since contacted
me and offered

48:57.334 --> 49:01.578
me a great position with his
firm in the New York office.

49:01.839 --> 49:03.617
I think you know I've always
wanted to experience some

49:03.641 --> 49:04.985
of the American
industry, and would

49:05.009 --> 49:06.420
like to offer my resignation.

49:09.413 --> 49:11.017
I've always enjoyed
working at Graphica,

49:11.315 --> 49:13.427
and would like to thank you
for your never failing support

49:13.451 --> 49:14.691
over the last few years.

49:14.985 --> 49:16.463
It's been a great experience
working with the team,

49:16.487 --> 49:20.299
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

49:20.591 --> 49:21.871
Are you sure you're set on this?

49:22.159 --> 49:23.159
Yeah!

49:25.796 --> 49:29.141
I didn't go through all this
just to never be around him.

49:32.203 --> 49:34.012
You do love him, don't you?

49:34.305 --> 49:35.305
Of course I do.

49:35.339 --> 49:36.784
You know I do.

49:37.041 --> 49:38.919
I just want to make sure
you're not going to do anything

49:38.943 --> 49:40.063
that you're going to regret.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.380
Excuse you.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.488
Excuse me.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.425
Look, I'm not going to
regret anything, all right?

49:45.449 --> 49:46.929
I'll open my own
freelance connection.

49:47.151 --> 49:50.894
I'll call it AT Design.

49:53.791 --> 49:55.862
Yeah.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.663
All right.

49:58.963 --> 50:01.041
You know, there's always the
option of a full-time nanny.

50:01.065 --> 50:01.566
No.

50:01.866 --> 50:02.970
No, no, no, no, no.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.805
I don't want anybody
else raising my child.

50:06.070 --> 50:07.811
Our... our child.

50:08.072 --> 50:08.709
- Mm.
- Sorry.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.006
Our child.

50:15.212 --> 50:19.160
Well, so much for the castle.

50:19.416 --> 50:22.397
Guess we can rule
out a career in architecture.

50:25.823 --> 50:27.666
I think he might be
better at demolition.

50:27.925 --> 50:28.426
Demolition?

50:28.726 --> 50:29.261
Yeah.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.595
Oh, don't say that.

50:30.895 --> 50:31.566
He'll wind up wearing
King G and hanging

50:31.862 --> 50:34.672
outwith guys called Bubba.

50:34.932 --> 50:35.932
Don't be an elitist.

50:39.770 --> 50:42.614
What's up with you?

50:42.907 --> 50:45.615
It's hard.

50:45.910 --> 50:47.355
Being a dad?

50:47.611 --> 50:49.249
No, hiding it.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.157
One of the makeup girls
came in the other day

50:51.181 --> 50:53.422
with a photograph of
her two-year-old son.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.677
I had to bite my tongue
not to tell her about Sam.

50:57.922 --> 50:59.230
I know.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.067
I mean, it's hard enough
not telling her about you,

51:01.091 --> 51:02.627
but... but him.

51:05.529 --> 51:06.529
Me?

51:10.034 --> 51:11.034
Me?

51:13.804 --> 51:16.614
Me?

51:35.492 --> 51:36.492
Daddy?

51:38.596 --> 51:39.639
Jesus, can you just take him?

51:39.663 --> 51:40.663
Sure.

51:40.798 --> 51:41.299
You got him?

51:41.599 --> 51:43.237
Yup.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.638
Yay, baby Sam!

51:46.303 --> 51:47.475
What's the matter?

51:47.771 --> 51:48.943
I just think he's in a mood.

51:49.239 --> 51:49.740
A what?

51:50.007 --> 51:51.007
A mood.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.675
A mood, you know.
He's being cranky.

51:52.810 --> 51:53.481
Shh!

51:53.777 --> 51:54.983
Infants don't have moods.

51:55.279 --> 51:58.624
Hey, hey, what's wrong with you?

51:58.916 --> 51:59.621
Nothing.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.123
Nothing.

52:01.418 --> 52:04.831
Hey, Steve, nothing's
wrong with me, all right?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.328
I'm going down to the shop.

52:06.624 --> 52:07.329
I'm going to get some milk.

52:07.625 --> 52:08.330
We've got milk.

52:08.626 --> 52:09.297
Yeah, it's off.

52:09.593 --> 52:10.593
Hey, hang on... hang on.

52:10.661 --> 52:13.039
We'll all go.

52:13.330 --> 52:13.865
To the shops?

52:14.164 --> 52:15.871
Yeah.

52:16.166 --> 52:18.544
Yeah, I don't think so.

52:18.836 --> 52:23.046
Won't belong.

52:49.800 --> 52:50.800
Hey.

53:01.211 --> 53:03.350
Are you going to
cry again on me?

53:03.647 --> 53:06.150
Oh, that tickles.

53:06.417 --> 53:09.591
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

53:09.887 --> 53:11.093
Mm?

53:11.388 --> 53:14.232
You like being hung upside
down, too, don't you?

53:14.525 --> 53:15.525
Don't you?
Yeah?

53:16.393 --> 53:18.600
Ahah, uh oh!

53:18.896 --> 53:20.068
Uh oh!

53:20.364 --> 53:21.570
Uh oh!

53:21.865 --> 53:22.865
I'm stuck upside down...

53:41.552 --> 53:42.552
Took a while.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.228
I went for a walk.

53:55.432 --> 53:56.432
Felt like some exercise.

54:02.740 --> 54:08.383
I, uh, got some baby milk.

54:08.645 --> 54:12.252
And, um, organic.

54:18.555 --> 54:19.555
And this.

54:27.464 --> 54:28.464
Sam's asleep.

54:33.737 --> 54:36.479
That's good.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.618
That's good, he... he needed it.

54:51.922 --> 54:53.196
So, dinner?

54:57.961 --> 54:58.961
Yup.

55:09.206 --> 55:10.206
Dinner.

55:36.366 --> 55:39.973
We are not of thee, nor
are we children at all.

55:40.237 --> 55:43.309
We are nothing, less
than nothing, and dreams.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.815
We are only what
might have been,

55:46.076 --> 55:49.523
and must wait upon
the tedious shores,

55:49.813 --> 55:51.850
or let the millions
of ages before we

55:52.149 --> 55:55.528
have existence and a name.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.189
What is it?

56:04.194 --> 56:08.165
"Dream-Children, A
Reverie," by Charles Lamb.

56:24.848 --> 56:26.088
All right, this is.

56:26.216 --> 56:26.921
OK.

56:27.217 --> 56:28.924
Sammy!

56:29.219 --> 56:31.631
He's looking... he
likes the helicopters.

56:31.922 --> 56:33.733
Maybe he wants to be a
pilot, or something like that.

56:33.757 --> 56:34.868
He's got the right
jacket for it.

56:34.892 --> 56:36.701
I think he does.

56:36.960 --> 56:37.700
A happy pilot.

56:37.961 --> 56:38.961
A happy pilot!

56:42.466 --> 56:44.241
He likes upside down!

56:55.545 --> 56:56.545
No, no!

56:57.547 --> 56:58.548
All right, all right.

56:58.815 --> 57:01.056
God, no!

57:01.318 --> 57:02.318
Get it!

57:02.486 --> 57:02.987
All right, all right, all right.

57:03.287 --> 57:06.427
Get it, get it!

57:06.723 --> 57:07.895
Hello?

57:08.158 --> 57:13.437
Hey, uh, this is a surprise.

57:13.730 --> 57:14.731
It's Nerine.

57:14.998 --> 57:16.978
What?

57:17.267 --> 57:17.938
Nerine?

57:18.235 --> 57:19.441
How are you?

57:25.175 --> 57:26.175
Hello?

57:30.847 --> 57:32.487
Alex, I'm going to
come down tomorrow, OK?

57:32.582 --> 57:34.823
Uh, OK, sure, whenever.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.758
I can come pick you
up later, if you want.

57:38.956 --> 57:39.956
Hello?

57:43.627 --> 57:46.039
No, I can get a...
A mate to drive me.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.307
How's Sammy?

57:55.505 --> 57:57.507
Hello?

57:57.808 --> 57:58.808
Hello?

58:02.512 --> 58:04.287
Hello?

58:04.548 --> 58:07.154
Nerine?

58:07.451 --> 58:11.524
What do you think
this could be about?

58:14.291 --> 58:16.362
Money.

58:58.502 --> 58:59.502
It's her fucking kid.

59:07.177 --> 59:09.054
It's hers.

59:09.346 --> 59:11.189
She's its mom.

59:11.448 --> 59:12.518
Nerine, if...

59:12.783 --> 59:16.026
You said that any
time I changed my mind,

59:16.286 --> 59:17.526
that I could come back.

59:17.788 --> 59:18.868
But we made an arrangement.

59:19.122 --> 59:20.402
That was the arrangement, Chris.

59:20.690 --> 59:22.260
There you go, Chris.

59:22.559 --> 59:25.631
Chris, problem solved.

59:25.929 --> 59:29.741
All right, OK, let's
be reasonable about this.

59:30.033 --> 59:34.709
If you really want Sam back,
then we won't oppose you...

59:34.971 --> 59:36.279
What the fuck you doing?

59:36.573 --> 59:38.746
Shut up!

59:39.042 --> 59:40.362
But we want to
know all the facts.

59:40.477 --> 59:41.477
Now, it was made...

59:41.711 --> 59:43.071
Hey, hey, hey!

59:43.113 --> 59:44.873
You fucking
talk to me, all right?

59:44.981 --> 59:46.021
You don't worry about her.

59:46.249 --> 59:46.920
You talk to me.

59:47.217 --> 59:50.221
And who the fuck are you?

59:50.487 --> 59:52.831
Well, I'm glad
you asked, Steven.

59:55.725 --> 59:56.725
It's Chris.

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.736
Really?

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.807
Baby, have
we got the right house?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:04.636
Yeah.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:05.436
You sure?

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.735
Yeah.

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:12.082
This is the number 3, isn't it'?

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.343
No, I'm only joking.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:14.643
I'm only joking.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.031
No, I'm... I'm really sorry.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:25.528
I'll tell you what, I'll
bet your viewers don't

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.428
know about this little fucking
game show going on here,

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.501
do they?

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:35.174
So if you don't give her
back the fucking kid, mate,

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.776
you won't be giving hugs to your
fucking precious fans anymore.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:41.345
You won't be shining your
pearly fucking whites on telly.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.358
You'll be getting fists
in your fucking arse

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.313
until you fucking
bleed in jail, cunt.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:46.609
You all right'?

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.859
But I bet you'd love that,
wouldn't you, princess?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:54.191
Blackmail's a criminal offense.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.244
What do you call fucking
tricking young girls

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:57.593
into getting their fucking kid?

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.401
Who the fuck are you?

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:06.037
Show them your ring ring, eh?

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:06.830
See?

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.130
Show 'em your ring.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.165
Hey.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:12.874
See, we're fucking married.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:13.739
See?

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.516
The fuck?

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.216
Come to think of it, that makes
me the kid's legal guardian...

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.241
Oh, that's debatable.

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:19.552
You're not even the real father.

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:20.576
How the fuck do you know?

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:28.797
Sammy might be getting a
little brother one day.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.435
Make a real family, something
you two fucking faggots

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:36.885
will never be able to manage.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.960
Listen, Jake, maybe we
can work something out.

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.233
Alex, be careful...

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.175
- Shut... just shut the fuck up!
- Just let me...

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:42.836
- Just me fucking do this...
- Just give us a week, Nerine!

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.578
- Oh, ho ho.
- One week!

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:45.278
A week for them...
to fucking get on a plane...

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:46.707
One-one week.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.347
And then we'll never
see those cunts again.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:48.940
Shut the fuck up, I'm
not talking to you.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.274
It's all right, Jakey.

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:51.177
I'll tell you who's
all right, sweetie.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.441
OK?
- It's all right.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:53.929
No, I'll tell you
who's all right.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.124
Right now, I'm saying
they're full of fucking shit.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:58.414
I'll pay you, cash...

01:01:58.582 --> 01:01:59.083
Steve!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.759
Now, just shut up!

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.051
How much?

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.096
It's a risk we're
taking, how fucking much?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.595
How much?

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.236
$5,000, just until we get
this clear in our minds.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:16.971
Why not'?

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.302
Ding ding.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:21.913
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.725
We have a winner,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:24.943
Yeah!

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:25.913
Mr. and Mrs. Faggot
just bought themselves

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:26.812
one week's stinking time.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.283
That's what I'm liking.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.752
Hey, want to go see him?

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.254
Come on, come on.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.722
Go get the fucking key.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:36.345
Hey, we're giving
you five grand...

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.965
Nay, you're giving us five grand

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.932
to see whether or not we'll let
you see the fucking kid again,

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:40.956
all right?

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.974
Just calm down, sweetie.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.974
Calm down, sweetie...

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.975
You're a fucking cunt!

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.306
It's all right.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.205
I'm just going to grab
my shit and leave.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.480
Is that all right with you?

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.482
You're a real fucking
cunt, do you hear me?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.778
What's that?

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.955
Maybe if I didn't
have a fucking ear,

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.954
perhaps Sammy ought
to be able to fucking

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:07.353
hear you better, huh?

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:08.894
Maybe if I didn't have
an ear, perhaps Sammy

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.955
won't be able to
fucking hear you better.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:24.839
Follow me.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.309
I dare you.

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:29.982
Got it!

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.273
Got it!

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.478
Going for a ride, mate.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:37.684
Here we go!

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:41.292
Here we go.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.833
So what are you doing
over the weekend?

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.507
Well, I was planning on
having a little dinner party.

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:37.107
Ooh!

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.145
But I'm not going to be
inviting these two.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:40.773
This is the excitement.

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.143
Alex!

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.977
Richard, hey, how are you?

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.276
Good, good.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.410
This is, uh, Sandra.

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:49.146
Hey!

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:50.446
Hi!

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.182
- This is Julian.
- Hi.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.481
Hey.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.322
And, uh, this is
my friend, Steve.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.153
Oh, hi.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:59.024
So how was New York?

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.323
Yeah, good.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:01.192
It's good.

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:01.969
It's good to see you.

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.703
Yeah, you too.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:07.133
Yeah, you know, I've got clients
that still miss you, you know.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.207
How about, uh, I get you to
come back and work again?

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:12.501
Oh, I don't know.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.715
So everything good?

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:20.612
Yeah, man.

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:22.015
Yeah.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.950
Yeah, couldn't be better.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:26.490
Well, um, come and have
a drink with us, yeah?

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:29.559
Share your stories about
the life in the pearl

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.299
of the civilized world, eh?

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.659
Great.

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:34.526
OK.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.824
Well, well.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:36.996
Hm!

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.671
Any other travel secrets
you'd like to share?

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:41.335
Yeah, how is New York
at this time of year?

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:44.237
New York, New York!

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:45.534
Where else are you going?

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:46.702
Bahamas next?

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.810
God, what is wrong with
both of you tonight?

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580
Come on, it's something.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:06:59.850
Oh!

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.822
Shots, maybe?

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.827
God, Gus has got more life in
bed than both of you, honestly.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:06.248
And that's after a few beers.

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:10.766
Like a bunch of dead fish.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.897
Mm!

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.373
Bugger, don't worry about them.

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.508
So tell me more
about this dinner

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.273
party we're going to have.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:22.016
Well, I was thinking
seafood-themed.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:22.773
No!

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.779
I'm over seafood.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.074
Let's do Greek.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.654
Oh, fuck off.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.205
Fuck, kid, if you
don't fucking shut up,

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.005
I'll fucking shut you up!

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:24.505
Never mind him, Jakey.

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:41.685
I'm trying to
fucking listen, kid!

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.430
I'm trying to fucking listen!

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.926
Fucking shut up,
you fucking kid!

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:47.549
What's the fucking
matter with you?

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:48.692
Fuck off!

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:50.511
Fucking mind your
own fucking business!

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.937
What is
your fucking shit... fucking

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:53.935
give him nothing!

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:55.437
Fuck you, kid!

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.871
Fuck and do that all
fucking day, too, you know!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.874
Leave him the fuck alone, Jakey!

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.408
I could fucking do it all
fucking day, longer than you,

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:03.344
you fucking kid!

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.551
You fucked up kid!

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.343
Whaa!

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:07.643
Whaa!

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:19.194
He's not going to let Sam
go for any single amount.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.933
He's got the perfect
blackmail scenario now.

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:22.635
Each time he goes broke,
he's going to threaten

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.702
to tell the world about us.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:26.069
I could fucking kill the cunt.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.522
I will fucking kill the cunt.

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:28.300
Alex, listen.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:29.667
I'll fucking kill him.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.109
It's not the end of the world.

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:33.876
I mean, we could take a break.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.207
I... I could have a nervous
breakdown or something,

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.006
you know'?

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:38.649
We'll go away.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.581
Why would you care?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.017
You know, he stole our baby,
and you want to take a holiday?

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:45.313
I mean...

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.858
How could just say that?

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.327
You're the one that wants
to go off to the west indies!

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.350
He's my son!

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.189
Your son?

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.591
Our son.

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.027
Don't you think I know that?

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.358
I don't know!

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.658
I've lost my son, too.

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:57.430
Oh, you didn't lose him.

01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:58.727
No, no, no.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.041
You paid that prick to take him.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.334
You let him go, you
fucking tipped like you

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.176
were tipping one of your
fucking waiter friends

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.508
for good service.
- Oh, fuck you.

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:06.768
You're a fucking joke.

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:07.405
Fuck you!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.274
You're a fucking joke!

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.107
Nobody made him.

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:10.907
Nobody forced.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.448
You did!

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:16.349
He wasn't even ours.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:17.716
He was never ours.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.190
I want you to leave.

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:29.864
Get out.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:31.126
Get the fuck out!

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:37.894
Hey, Kimber, sweetheart.

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:46.165
Me?

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:48.534
I want to get messy.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.831
I want to get fucked up.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.051
Yeah, come up.

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:12.987
What the fuck happened?

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.091
I've had a fuck few days.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:16.351
Sit.

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:27.995
I don't think I
can go home tonight.

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:33.143
I... I don't think I can go home.

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:41.652
We had a fight.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.650
Over what?

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:52.559
Family.

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:55.392
Oh, that one.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:59.571
Yeah, always gives
me the twitch.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:00.862
Me too.

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:07.309
I don't know, I need more.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.675
I just-I don't know.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:15.217
Steven, it is OK to
not want to settle down.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.184
OK'?

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.051
You are allowed to just
give a fuck about yourself.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.762
I mean, babies
aren't for everyone.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.361
We knew we had to be careful.

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.600
He should respect who you are.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:28.391
Fucking Alex.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.103
Hey!

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:32.600
Stop worrying about him.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:37.125
Worry about you, mate.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.825
Listen, Tim...

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:05.792
What?

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.294
Stop!

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:08.590
Stop!

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.264
Fuck... what the fuck, Steven?

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:12.767
Get the... get the fuck out!

01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:39.521
Morning.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.324
I lost my keys.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:30.039
Where'd you go last night?

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.047
No... don't tell me.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.213
I'm sorry.

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:02.378
I miss you both.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:44.153
There's
something I need you to do.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:49.191
Hey, you got to go for me.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:51.158
I can't go to them, Jakey.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:57.634
I can't.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:03.798
No!

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:07.780
I'll fucking do it!

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.315
I'll find a guy and I'll get
you a couple of hundred, easy!

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.339
Fucking

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:13.009
Fuck you!

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.379
You fucking will!

01:20:14.677 --> 01:20:16.254
You'll tell them all
your fucking troubles!

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:17.348
I swear!

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:18.990
You fucking did that
once before, remember?

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.614
I swear I'll just get the money!

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:21.456
Fuck off.

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:22.821
Just get the...

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.195
Listen to me, don't
fucking hit me, bitch.

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:24.720
Eh'?

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.897
You fucking hit <i>me'?</i>

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.463
Fucking try.

01:20:28.724 --> 01:20:30.067
Fucking try it again!

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:33.499
Fucking try it again!

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:36.299
As if I want fucking petty cash.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:40.638
Does it fucking
look like I want it?

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:42.183
I want $100,000 fucking dollars.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:43.510
I want $100,000-

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:44.307
How the fuck...

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.573
dollars!

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:46.685
Don't fucking back.

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:47.983
I want 100 grand...

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:48.983
How the fuck am I meant
to ask for that much money?

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.587
By fucking tomorrow.

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.559
What if they
don't give it to me?

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:07.203
Jakey, what if they
don't give it to me?

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:14.509
What did we get the kid for?

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:17.910
What did we get the kid for?

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.346
What did we get the kid for?

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.849
<i>Hey, Sammy'.!</i>

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:25.684
What did we get
the fucking kid for, eh?

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:27.393
What the fuck did
we get him for?

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:28.683
All right, Jakie, Jakie.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:30.591
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.593
I've got to take, Jake.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.265
I've got to take him.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.534
I've got to take-I've got
to take Sammy with me... I...

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.969
You fucking won't take him!

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.671
I have to take him with me,
otherwise they won't give me...

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:41.272
You fucking won't fucking
take him with you!

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.036
You fucking bitch!

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.708
You fucking don't come back!

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:46.206
You fucking don't come back
or I'll fucking stitch him...

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.139
Please don't hurt him!

01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:50.438
Into Sam.

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.482
I'll fucking stick one into you.

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:54.254
If you don't fucking
come back, I'll

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:57.149
fucking All right?

01:21:57.446 --> 01:21:58.151
OK'?

01:21:58.447 --> 01:21:59.567
Stop it, please!

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.150
You fucking

01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:25.317
Oy, squid lips, get your
hand off it, we're on.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.850
Fuck me, Kimber!

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.560
You're going to force
us into a later time

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:36.995
slot dressed like that.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.286
I love it!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.734
Well, if you think
it's too much,

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.766
maybe you should come
and dress me next time.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:43.904
Well, unfortunately, my
specialty is undressing,

01:22:44.026 --> 01:22:45.334
isn't it, sweetheart'?

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.662
Hm, that works as well.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:51.933
No thanks.

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:03.989
Come on, you don't
need to go, eh?

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:07.955
Where you going to go?

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:08.957
Come on.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:10.458
Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:21.662
Come on.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.680
Come on.

01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:39.981
All right.

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.385
Mm.

01:24:02.738 --> 01:24:03.738
It's OK, Jakey.

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:12.054
We have exclusive uncensored
footage of Steven Evans'

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:15.556
wild sex romp in Melbourne
that everybody's talking about

01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:17.558
and that Channel 4
didn't want you to see.

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:19.526
Let's take a look.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.042
You never know who's
going to be watching.

01:24:30.299 --> 01:24:32.540
Fucking bullshit!

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.041
Fuck you!

01:24:34.303 --> 01:24:35.976
Fuck you!

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.441
What the fuck?

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:36.697
How the fuck'?

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:42.176
How did you fucking get that?

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:44.678
Holy shit!

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.179
Shut up, Sammy.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:47.180
Don't worry, baby.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.149
It'll be all right.

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.669
The embryo
is now starting to take shape.

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:07.569
Fuck.

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:09.536
Fucking.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:14.041
The
top... The trunk of the body

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:15.336
stretches down below.

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:23.485
The head doesn't look
much like a head yet.

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:26.988
But at day 15, nerve
cells begin to form

01:26:27.249 --> 01:26:29.160
in what will become
the brain, as

01:26:29.418 --> 01:26:30.658
well as in the spinal column...

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:31.719
Jakey?

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.364
Which is exposed

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.228
and totally unprotected
by either skin or bone.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.026
Jake?

01:26:53.075 --> 01:26:55.282
Hello?

01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:02.083
Come on.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:21.275
There's still some
more stuff in the cot.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:22.742
Alex, get the stuff.

01:27:23.038 --> 01:27:24.244
Yup.

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:27.042
Nerine, get Sam and take
him downstairs in the car.

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:28.310
OK'?

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.610
Sammy, say, bye-bye.

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:32.713
Bye-bye, Sammy.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.833
Steve.

01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:48.472
Doesn't he look odd to you?

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:49.764
Yeah.

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:00.786
He doesn't have a pulse.

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:02.111
Shit!

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.448
All right, I'm
calling triple zero.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.953
Hey, put it away.

01:28:07.249 --> 01:28:10.162
We don't have to call anyone.

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:11.452
We can't!

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:12.653
Yes, we can.

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:20.836
Alex, get that stuff
and go downstairs now.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.129
NOW!

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:41.682
OK.

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:12.688
Now he's yours,.

01:29:12.981 --> 01:29:13.981
He always was.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.162
Alex, I...

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:23.835
I know, uh, we don't have
any legal right to him.

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:28.368
I know.

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:30.404
I... I know that.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.704
And if, you know, if you
need to be around him, I...

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:36.003
I understand that.

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:42.686
I... I know how hard it
is to be away from him.

01:29:45.914 --> 01:29:48.918
Maybe one day I can be like
Auntie Nerine or something.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.535
For right now, I
just need to go away.

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:21.215
I'm going to go to bed.

01:30:27.222 --> 01:30:32.222
Nerine, you know, stay for
as long as you want, OK?

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:41.302
You know that?

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:47.310
Stay, stay forever,
if you want to.

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:50.021
Forever?

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:51.312
Nothing lasts forever.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:17.824
But the sad truth to all this

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:20.509
is that, legally, we're
only Sam's guardians.

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:25.724
In the eyes of the law, we're
his protectors, his providers,

01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:29.052
his defenders, and his friends.

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:34.391
But the law will not allow
us to be called his fathers.

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:37.169
Now, I want every
man and woman to be

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:41.134
able to feel the
joy that I feel,

01:31:41.396 --> 01:31:44.707
<i>so</i> I've decided to end
my career in television

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.072
and join the G&L Alliance
for the sole purpose

01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:52.079
of completely legalizing
adoption for same-sex couples.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:12.359
How do you feel?

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:18.432
Proud.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.685
My dad called.

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:27.941
Wants to meet up.

01:32:34.249 --> 01:32:35.249
Scared, Alex?

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:43.797
Being scared, it... it
doesn't mean you're weak.

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:51.409
I just want Sam to
feel proud of me.

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:52.699
He will be.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:59.374
We've witnessed the commitment
of two people in love.

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:03.248
Two men, which is right.

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:07.823
But it doesn't only mean a
union between Steven and Alex,

01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:10.995
it also signifies a family.

01:33:11.286 --> 01:33:15.234
Steven, Alex, and
their son, Sam,

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:19.063
whom they will nurture and
bring up to be the man they

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:21.807
want him to be.

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:27.604
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you Steven and Alex.

01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:01.880
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:04.548
please charge your glasses
and join me in a toast

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:08.218
to the happy couple, the
two grooms, Alex and Steven.

01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:11.218
Alex and Steven!
