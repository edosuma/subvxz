WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.647
Okay, everybody.
Big, big news.

00:05.138 --> 00:06.378
Leslie, would you
like to do the honors?

00:06.439 --> 00:07.747
No, I think you
should deliver the news.

00:07.907 --> 00:08.908
Yeah, but you're
the candidate.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.147
Yeah, but you're the
brilliant campaign manager.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.280
But you're the cutest.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.187
I love you.
I love you, too.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.549
Hey. Were you going
to tell us something?

00:16.716 --> 00:17.922
Right, Oh, yeah.

00:17.984 --> 00:22.763
The latest poll has us only two
points behind Bobby Newport.

00:22.822 --> 00:23.926
Two points!

00:23.990 --> 00:26.470
I know. You guys, we only have
one more day to close the gap,

00:26.526 --> 00:29.700
and we are gonna do so
in a one-time campaign blitz

00:29.763 --> 00:31.037
aboard the SS Knope.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.473
This is going to be our
home for the next 24 hours.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.479
And if we win, hopefully, it will be
the home that Ben and I share forever.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.015
Uh, what? It was
just an idea I had.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.709
We don't have to do it. Whatever.
We can talk about it.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.877
Okay. Here we go.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.752
We've come so far. I want
this so bad, I can taste it.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.519
When I close my eyes,
I can picture

00:47.580 --> 00:50.254
the flash of the cameras
at my swearing-in.

00:50.316 --> 00:54.287
And I can hear the sound of the
applause when I take my oath.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.890
And I can see,
in the crowd,

00:56.956 --> 01:00.369
President Obama
smiling at me.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.239
He made it. I didn't think he
would come, but he made it.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.644
Hey, buddy.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.520 --> 01:30.592
A few days ago, on a routine
campaign stop in downtown Pawnee,

01:30.657 --> 01:34.104
one Leslie Knope,
pause, was attacked...

01:34.527 --> 01:35.631
Play-

01:35.695 --> 01:37.197
By a pie.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.869
Luckily, it only hit Jerry,
so no damage was done.

01:39.933 --> 01:44.382
Play. The only evidence we have
is the video shot by... Pause.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.940
My wife,
April Ludgate.

01:47.307 --> 01:50.254
This is Bert Macklin's
greatest assignment yet.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.154
If you are watching,
perpetrator...

01:54.280 --> 01:57.489
Just know that you
are still at large.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.856
Okay, listen up, folks. We have
a security situation here.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.457
As you know, when we
reach the location,

02:03.523 --> 02:06.003
I will be conducting
a security sweep.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.299
Also, from now on,
we'll be using code names.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.466
You can address me
as Eagle One.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.936
Ann, code name,
Been There, Done That.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.012
April is
Currently Doing That.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.440
Donna is It Happened
Once in a Dream.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.550
Chris, code name,
If I Had to Pick a Dude.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.282
Ben is...

02:21.708 --> 02:22.709
Eagle Two.

02:22.775 --> 02:23.845
Oh, thank God.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.516
No, please.
Come on.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.081
We have a problem.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.856
The vans we rented to take senior
citizens to the polls tomorrow

02:30.950 --> 02:32.930
are now, quote,
"No longer available."

02:33.086 --> 02:35.589
What? I thought we locked those
vans down, like, a week ago.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.931
Yeah, we worked really hard to get
those seniors back on our side

02:37.991 --> 02:40.198
after that ramp debacle.
I really need their votes.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.172
Okay, last second problems
like this always crop up.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.209
But the team can handle it, right?
Right?

02:45.532 --> 02:46.533
Right.
Yes.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.874
Okay, so, Tom, go down there
and get those vans back.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.176
I'll use my legendary
Haverford charm.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.339
I have total faith in you.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.852
Take Donna with you.
Ron, you go, too.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.619
April, you are a very intelligent
and savvy young woman.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.281
I do not think of you
as just a gofer.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.881
But right now,
I need you to get me

03:00.947 --> 03:02.426
a triple espresso
with eight sugars.

03:02.882 --> 03:03.883
Okay.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.025
I'm on it.
I'll go. I'm going.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.688
Please, I can go.
I don't mind.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.030
It's better than listening to her
stump speech for a millionth time.

03:10.123 --> 03:14.868
No. I will do it. I have to do it.
I need to do it. Goodbye.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.602
This has been a difficult
year for me, romantically.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.201
Millicent Gergich, Ann
Perkins, Andy's professor.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.245
Lots of disappointment.

03:23.303 --> 03:27.479
But if I keep my body moving and
my mind occupied at all times,

03:27.540 --> 03:31.249
I will avoid falling into
a bottomless pit of despair.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.588
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

03:34.681 --> 03:38.959
the next City Councilor of the great
city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.633
This is Eagle One. Been There,
Done That is leaving the stage.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.630
I'd Be Lying If
I Said I Hadn't

03:45.692 --> 03:47.000
Thought About It
is in position.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.403
What do we want
for our city?

03:50.797 --> 03:52.105
I'll tell you what I want.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.235
I want better schools.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.044
I want cleaner streets.

03:55.101 --> 03:59.880
I want to expel the violent gangs
of geese in Detweiler Square.

03:59.973 --> 04:04.479
And I will finally eliminate
this city's libraries.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.457
In the last few weeks,
we've turned this campaign

04:08.514 --> 04:10.425
into a well-oiled machine.

04:10.483 --> 04:14.625
Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes
and 40 seconds every time.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.360
Here, check this out.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.733
There will be
a big laugh right now.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.876
And now, a two-second
awkward silence

04:26.966 --> 04:29.105
after Leslie does her Rodney
Dangerfield impression.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.841
I tell you, these geese
don't give me no respect.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.211
No respect at all.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.113
She insists on trying it
every time, and it never works.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.656
But the rest of the
speech, fantastic.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.249
When I was
building parks,

04:42.315 --> 04:45.558
helping the community and putting
together the Harvest Festival,

04:45.618 --> 04:46.790
where was Bobby?

04:47.153 --> 04:48.757
He and his father,
Nick Newport,

04:48.855 --> 04:51.529
were exploiting this city
for their personal gain.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.236
Eating candy fed to
them by their butler.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.408
Candy that was made by the
hardworking people of this town.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.338
You deserve more.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.074
Here's the best part. Watch
what happens when she says,

05:03.136 --> 05:06.481
"Together, we can
build a better Pawnee."

05:10.476 --> 05:12.956
Everybody says they
care about the issues,

05:13.079 --> 05:16.288
but at the end of the day,
all anyone really wants

05:16.349 --> 05:19.421
is free clothing shot
at them from a cannon.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.363
I've been staring
at this board for days.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.327
I'm so close to
putting it together.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.065
There's got to be
something we missed.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.363
Well, let's go
over this again.

05:30.430 --> 05:34.970
The video shows that the pie
came from a high angle.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.275
So, it would have
hit your face...

05:38.371 --> 05:39.372
Like this.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.976
Mmm-hmm.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.346
Don't close your eyes.

05:49.215 --> 05:52.128
No. No, it actually
was from up higher.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.463
Is that about right?
Yeah.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.592
Good. Clean yourself up.
Let's do this again.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.070
I assumed
this was obvious,

06:02.128 --> 06:03.607
but in the future,
I'd prefer

06:03.663 --> 06:05.233
not to be a part of
any conversation

06:05.298 --> 06:07.642
about which
body oil is best.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.111
Lavender.
Toasted marshmallow.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.416
Are you joking? I really can't
tell if you're joking right now.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.680
Okay, I let you
have your sandwich,

06:14.741 --> 06:16.721
but I don't wanna see any
shreds of meat on my floor.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.550
I leave no meat behind.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.557
It's an honor thing.
Can I have my shoes back?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.753
Wait till you
exit the car.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.419
I have to protect
my floor mats.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.518
Yes, ma'am.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.623
Okay, the stage is
all set, and we are

06:28.688 --> 06:29.826
thirty seconds
ahead of schedule.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.993
Thirty seconds
ahead of schedule.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.058
Nice!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.661
You guys synchronized
your watches, didn't you?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.137
Yeah, well, it's not
much of a machine, Ann,

06:35.194 --> 06:36.537
if the parts
aren't synchronized.

06:36.596 --> 06:37.631
Yes.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.870
While I was morally opposed
to the amount of sugar added,

06:39.932 --> 06:41.138
I did get Leslie
her coffee,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.544
and some green tea and Agave
in case she changes her mind.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No one
gets near Leslie without my say so.

06:46.639 --> 06:47.640
Andy, it's me.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.482
I messed up once, I have
to be extra-safe now.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.979
You can always tell
when someone's lying

06:53.079 --> 06:55.650
by looking into their eyes.
Let me look into your eyes.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.157
Oh, my God,
they're beautiful.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.029
Your story checks out.
Get out of here, kid.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.327
Hey, Bill. Tom Haverford
from the Knope campaign.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.770
Hey, you brought the whole
posse with you, huh?

07:10.329 --> 07:11.706
I'm not changing my mind.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.801
We already paid for
those vans, Mr. Butler.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.812
$900 for one day.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.542
Yeah, it was $900,
but now it's $10,000.

07:18.638 --> 07:19.708
Excuse me?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.683
The Newport campaign
offered me 10 grand

07:21.741 --> 07:23.743
to just rent the vans
and park them somewhere,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.753
so I'm gonna tear up your contract,
and I'm gonna take the money.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.486
Anything else? No?

07:28.548 --> 07:29.549
Great.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.217
Well, what now?

07:31.284 --> 07:34.265
He's just playing hardball Let me
tell you how it's gonna go down.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.800
In a few minutes, we'll walk in
there, we'll give him our demands

07:36.856 --> 07:39.234
and then, bam!
I start crying.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.034
We need the vans so bad.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.541
Please give us the vans. Please.
We need the vans.

07:45.631 --> 07:50.080
And if elected, I promise to
stop the Newports and Sweetums

07:50.136 --> 07:53.413
from blatantly dumping contaminants
into the Pawnee River.

07:55.374 --> 07:58.981
Leslie, can you comment on
Bobby's father, Nick Newport?

07:59.078 --> 08:00.853
Nick Newport has
been intimidating

08:00.913 --> 08:03.826
and bullying and poisoning
this town for years.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.726
Frankly, he's a real jerk.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.196
And if he thinks he can buy this
election for his son, he's wrong.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.927
Sorry. I meant,
can you comment

08:09.989 --> 08:12.765
on Nick Newport
dying earlier today?

08:13.593 --> 08:15.231
He died?

08:16.262 --> 08:17.605
I---

08:18.831 --> 08:19.832
Sad.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.379
Is that your official statement?
"I sad"?

08:23.102 --> 08:26.481
No. My official statement is,

08:26.539 --> 08:29.748
that is, overall, a bummer.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.810
Oh.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.982
And together, we can
build a better Pawnee.

08:35.381 --> 08:39.158
No. This isn't the time.
No, guys.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.798
Frankly, he's a real jerk.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.362
Harsh words. But this reporter
does love those T-shirt cannons.

08:49.428 --> 08:51.499
Now, Jen, what are your
thoughts about all of this?

08:51.564 --> 08:53.566
This is not
a time for politics.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.471
I am calling
on Leslie Knope

08:55.535 --> 08:57.640
to cancel all of
her campaign events

08:57.703 --> 08:59.774
out of respect for
the Newport family.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.780
Anything else would
be a classless move.

09:02.842 --> 09:07.484
On par with spray-painting
nipples on the Lincoln Memorial.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.894
Okay, emergency meeting. I need
everyone to gather around me,

09:11.951 --> 09:13.453
in order of how
much I trust them.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.932
Here's the situation.
A man has died.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.402
But that man is 98 years
old, and he's an awful man.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.132
However, he is a man,
and he died.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.174
Also, you called
the dead man a jerk.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.005
However, he was a jerk.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.108
He put a lot of
people out of work,

09:28.167 --> 09:31.046
he had tons of mistresses,
he polluted this town.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.240
Okay, Ben.
What do we do?

09:32.305 --> 09:35.115
Okay. It's unfortunate,
but the stakes are too high.

09:35.174 --> 09:38.383
We can't just stop campaigning.
We stop, we lose.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.751
Good answer, great body.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.155
Ann, try to beat
what he said.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.692
I'm not gonna beat him.

09:42.848 --> 09:43.849
Not with that attitude.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.827
Okay, fine. I think
you should stop.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.887
At least until you apologize
to Bobby in person.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.330
April?
l wasn’t listening,

09:49.388 --> 09:51.334
but I strongly
disagree with Ann.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.425
Andy?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.267
If the guy...

09:55.328 --> 09:56.329
Okay.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.602
I absolutely think that we
should keep campaigning.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.701
The worst possible thing we
could do would be to stop.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.905
Because if the campaign
stops, we all stop.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.381
And stopping is certain death.
Who wants a panini?

10:05.471 --> 10:07.178
Anyone? Everyone?
I'm gonna say everyone.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.343
All right.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.781
All right, Leslie.
What's your call?

10:10.843 --> 10:13.881
Ann, there is nothing
harder in the entire world

10:13.946 --> 10:15.619
than saying no to
your beautiful face.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.328
But I'm going to. No. We're going
to keep campaigning. Okay?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.124
But we're going to do it in
a classy and respectful way

10:20.186 --> 10:21.290
to get Ann off
of our backs.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.757
What's next
on the schedge?

10:23.456 --> 10:26.266
If you let Newport have the vans,
they just sit there in a lot.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.463
If you let us have the vans,
they drive around town all day.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.800
Free publicity. Everyone
will see your logo.

10:32.865 --> 10:35.971
Which is you all pressed up
on some chick with huge cans.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.106
Yeah. It was
a hell of a day.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.478
People need to
know about it.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.949
And I don't need
free publicity.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.281
I can just pay for it.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.617
With my $10,000.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.953
Look. I ain't going to
try to play a player.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.856
You're trying to get beaucoup
bucks, just like the rest of us.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.790
So, how about this?
I have a business idea

10:50.850 --> 10:53.126
for a gourmet
alcoholic yogurt.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.256
I call it Yogurt Platinum.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.361
I'll let you in on
the ground floor.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.029
And let me tell you, it's going to
be worth way more than 10 grand.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.932
Yeah, but now that
I know your bad idea,

11:01.994 --> 11:03.598
I can start
the company myself.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.870
With my $10,000.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.967
No, you can't
do that. Ron.

11:08.034 --> 11:11.106
Tom, Donna, could you
please give us a moment?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.150
I'd like to talk
to Bill man-to-man.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.218
He's gonna steal
Yogurt Platinum.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.412
No, I'm not.

11:17.643 --> 11:21.318
5-15, 256. Got a 3-33.

11:21.814 --> 11:22.815
Copy that.

11:23.249 --> 11:24.557
Andy Dwyer.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.354
Er... Bert Macklin.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.489
Eagle One.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.461
We need to see
your security plan.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.358
This is a
elementary school.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.831
My security plan is to
stand right here. Hmm.

11:35.561 --> 11:36.562
Sounds good.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.267
Looks like you
got this post.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.674
You see anything suspicious, you
just let me know immediately.

11:40.733 --> 11:41.734
Okay?
Nope

11:42.334 --> 11:43.335
That's cool.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.515
Dude, what are you doing?

11:53.579 --> 11:54.614
Washing the bus.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.325
I have something I need
to take my mind off of.

11:57.750 --> 11:58.751
Do you need something?

11:58.951 --> 12:00.555
Would you like to
give me something to do?

12:00.619 --> 12:02.394
Please. Please,
April, please.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.696
Hey!

12:04.757 --> 12:05.963
Thank you, April.

12:06.258 --> 12:09.034
When you're done, go get
Jerry another milkshake.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.303
And then give it to me and I
will throw it on the bus again.

12:13.966 --> 12:18.176
"We're all your friends," said Mr. Bacon.
"Welcome home." The end.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.843
And that is
Groffle the Awful Waffle,

12:20.906 --> 12:23.352
a book that I
wrote and published

12:23.409 --> 12:25.787
on behalf of my
education initiative.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.825
Any questions? Yes.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.086
How did Groffle
cross the syrup river?

12:30.149 --> 12:32.459
And why did you call
Mr. Newport a jerk?

12:33.085 --> 12:36.362
Well, when I
called him a jerk,

12:36.422 --> 12:39.130
I didn't know
that he had passed

12:39.625 --> 12:42.367
into candy heaven.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.840
Do you still
think he's a jerk?

12:44.997 --> 12:47.705
And you didn't answer
the syrup question.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.815
Well, I should not have
called Nick Newport a jerk.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.750
Because we need to be
respectful of all dead people.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.844
I mean,
not Stalin or Hitler,

12:58.010 --> 12:59.751
but I'm not calling
Nick Newport Hitler.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.851
Ms. Knope, I have a follow-up to what
I'm now deciding to call, "Jerk-gate."

13:03.949 --> 13:06.156
Are there any other
deceased members of

13:06.218 --> 13:08.357
Bobby Newport's family
you'd like to attack?

13:08.420 --> 13:09.990
And quit ducking
the waffle question.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.693
Did Groffle use
a boat of some kind?

13:11.824 --> 13:13.929
All right. That's all the questions for now.
Thank you, everybody.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.063
Are we to assume
that he swam

13:15.127 --> 13:16.663
- across the syrup river?
- Miss Knope?

13:17.229 --> 13:20.267
I am never going to get away
from these Nick Newport questions.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.039
And it is very
clear in the book

13:22.101 --> 13:25.014
that Groffle crosses the syrup
river on the butter bridge.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.845
Well, maybe you
need to start acting

13:26.906 --> 13:28.647
a little bit more
like Groffle the Waffle

13:28.707 --> 13:30.345
when he was nice to
McDuffin the Muffin.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.054
AKA Bobby Newport.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.658
You guys need to apologize.
Stop campaigning.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.293
Okay, fine.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.591
We go to Bobby Newport,
you apologize...

13:40.686 --> 13:41.687
Good.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.065
And then, we leak the details to the
press, which restores your reputation

13:45.124 --> 13:47.035
and buys us enough time
to finish the bus tour.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.093
Nice.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.730
No, that's not
a real apology.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.103
It's just sneaky.
I don't like it.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.769
Ann, for once,
this is not about you.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.107
A man is dead.

13:56.435 --> 14:00.611
Look, friend. I respect your slavish
devotion to the free market.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.512
But you can't
welch on a contract.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.388
Where I come from,
a man's word is sacred.

14:07.546 --> 14:11.585
Okay. What's your stance on pinky
swears, George Washington?

14:11.717 --> 14:13.287
I'm taking the money.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.331
Fine. I'll match it.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.462
I'll give you $10,000
for the vans. Deal?

14:19.525 --> 14:22.131
No. Price has gone up.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.264
Now it's $12,000.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.705
What? Why?

14:24.763 --> 14:27.903
Look, I own a fleet of
22 crappy white vans.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.310
And for some reason,
there's a massive

14:29.368 --> 14:31.109
bidding war
going on over them.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.708
Now, for a guy whose only assets
are 22 crappy white vans,

14:34.773 --> 14:36.309
it's pretty much
a dream scenario.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.255
So I'm just gonna ride this
out, see where it takes me.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.016
And now it's $15,000.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.627
Okay. I talked
Newport's people

14:44.683 --> 14:46.594
into giving us 10 minutes
alone with Bobby.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.495
So, we get in there,
we apologize,

14:48.554 --> 14:50.329
and then we get back
on the campaign trail.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.833
Okay. How do we
leak this to the press?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.029
Do we, like,
release a statement?

14:53.092 --> 14:54.628
Do we call somebody?

14:54.693 --> 14:57.503
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.407
Oh, my God. Why are there
so many people here?

15:00.833 --> 15:03.575
It's a trap. It's a trap!
We've got to get out of here.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.947
It's a time for
solemnity and remembrance.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.782
This is not
a time for politics.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.813
Oh. LESLIE: Okay, will
you stop, please?

15:11.877 --> 15:13.151
Turn the bus around.

15:13.212 --> 15:18.321
Leslie Knope is driving her campaign
bus through a memorial service.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.521
Back it up.
Back it up.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.757
Okay, back up.
Back it up.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.629
Just when we thought she
couldn't stoop any lower.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.603
Go forward! Go forward!

15:31.163 --> 15:33.143
I feel like he's
dying all over again.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.908
Stop it.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.140
Oh, no.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.615
Hi.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.522
Sorry. Are we late?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.825
So, I hate to
bring this up again,

15:55.888 --> 15:57.731
but I just want to make sure
that I'm going to get paid.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.100
It was a handshake agreement
with Mr. Newport.

16:00.159 --> 16:01.194
It was for
a lot of money.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.568
Anyway, you can wire transfer it.
Anyway, sorry for your loss.

16:03.629 --> 16:07.076
I can't believe you turned this
situation into a political sideshow.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.806
Oh, come on. You guys were only
going to apologize for the press.

16:09.935 --> 16:12.142
No way. That's not us.
You don't know us at all.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.342
It's rude to say it.

16:13.439 --> 16:14.509
We wouldn't
even think it.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.244
Yeah, that's
a ridiculous claim.

16:16.308 --> 16:20.552
We brought a "Sorry For Your
Loss" fruit basket for Bobby.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.650
And it is very classy.
No melon, no apples.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.493
You were going to use us, and we
just turned the tables on you.

16:27.686 --> 16:28.960
'Cause I'm smarter
and faster.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.661
That is not a judgment,
that's just a fact.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.204
We're both just doing whatever
it takes to win. Right?

16:35.027 --> 16:37.234
I love polka dots.
So cute.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.239
I'm sorry. I should
have seen this coming.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.974
And we should not have driven here
in a bus with your face on it.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.174
No, it's my fault.

16:45.270 --> 16:47.546
And you know what? Jen is right.
I'm no better than her.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.711
No, Leslie.
Yes, you are.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.187
All you need to do is stop
the machine for a second

16:52.244 --> 16:53.723
and go apologize to Bobby.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.854
Alone. Without cameras.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.820
Thanks, Ann, but where was
that advice six hours ago?

16:59.251 --> 17:00.355
That's not going to work.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.624
I had to try.

17:06.258 --> 17:09.034
April, I just got
Champion his dog food,

17:09.094 --> 17:10.868
cleaned your house,
filed that paperwork,

17:10.929 --> 17:12.965
you are officially
April Ludgate-Dwyer,

17:13.332 --> 17:16.369
installed a smoke detector and
now I'm back. What's next?

17:16.468 --> 17:20.244
Nothing, Chris. Just sit down
somewhere and stop bothering me.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.647
I can't.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.751
I've had a very tough year.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.619
I can't stop thinking
about Ann and Millicent.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.160
And if I'm alone with my
thoughts, I go to a dark place.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.423
Okay. First of all,
dark places are awesome.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.794
Secondly, Ann is kind of lame,
so way to dodge a bullet.

17:36.922 --> 17:40.028
And Millicent is Jerry's
daughter, so two bullets.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.602
And you're not alone.
You've got...

17:43.662 --> 17:46.268
Lots of friends somewhere.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.310
I assume.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.808
You're going
to be just fine.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.241
Thank you.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.579
You're right.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.511
I'll be fine.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.554
I'm not fine.
It didn't work.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.385
Hey, Bobby.

18:07.719 --> 18:08.993
Oh, hi.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.233
Want to play bowling?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.199
Why don't you play
with the real one?

18:14.159 --> 18:15.194
Oh.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.137
I like this one better.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.641
The little guy
looks like me.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.967
Hey, can we talk
for a second?

18:22.568 --> 18:24.946
Look, I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry your dad died.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.415
And I'm really, really
sorry I called him a jerk.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.447
That's okay.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.077
He was, like,
a million years old.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.049
And he was
kind of a jerk.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.854
The only reason I did this
campaign was to impress him,

18:37.916 --> 18:39.896
and he couldn't
have cared less.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.657
You know, my mom was a great
athlete when she was a kid.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.163
So, in junior high,
I joined the track team

18:48.227 --> 18:49.968
to impress her.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.234
Even though I hated it.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.170
And at the end
of the year,

18:53.232 --> 18:57.271
I ran the 5,000 meters
in this huge track event,

18:57.336 --> 18:59.907
and I finished dead last.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.153
And I thought she was going to
be really disappointed in me.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.416
But she wasn't.
She ran up to me,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.924
and she wrapped me
up in this big hug,

19:08.981 --> 19:12.292
and she told me she had never
been more proud of me.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.259
Thanks, Leslie.
That's a great story.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.864
I'm not 100% sure
I get the point, but...

19:19.925 --> 19:22.599
You finished
this race, Bobby.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.235
The campaign is over,
and you finished.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.502
Win or lose,

19:28.567 --> 19:30.843
I bet you anything that
your dad was proud of you.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.507
Now, I get it.
There you go.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.610
Your mom and my dad
are both dicks.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.348
There's no vans
within 50 miles.

19:41.413 --> 19:45.054
And for some reason, no one
wants to lend me $10,000.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.793
Even if we
had the dough,

19:46.985 --> 19:49.864
that bunco artist would
just demand more. Trust me.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.293
Don't move.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.701
Let's just stay here for, like,
an hour and not let him out.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.600
This isn't right. Our girl's worked hard.
We're so close.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.207
I know he didn't
just hit my baby.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.143
Hey! What the hell, guys?

20:05.437 --> 20:06.438
Move!

20:06.972 --> 20:09.350
All right. Y'all got
your seat belts on?

20:14.179 --> 20:17.717
Did you see that? That son of
a bitch just rear-ended me.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.318
Am I dead?

20:19.451 --> 20:20.862
What the hell?

20:20.919 --> 20:22.262
Exactly, Bill.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.823
What the hell?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.095
You just rear-ended me.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.464
That is not
what happened.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.833
But I've got witnesses.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.804
Yeah. It went down
exactly the way

20:29.861 --> 20:31.738
my girl said it did,
you mean, bald man.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.571
Hey, what about you,
Mr. A-Man's-Word-is-Sacred?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.237
Well, it is. But you're an ass....

20:38.303 --> 20:40.214
So, we can
settle this now.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.377
I will accept payment
in van rentals.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.218
All right, let's go
to the video again.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.851
Sweet kick.
Leslie exits the building.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.055
And then,
you get hit.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.035
What else do we know?

20:59.157 --> 21:02.604
We know that Leslie was about
15 feet in front of you.

21:02.661 --> 21:05.141
So, clearly, the assailant
has terrible aim.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.633
Or...

21:09.701 --> 21:11.112
Leslie wasn't the target.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.638
Well, who, then?

21:15.307 --> 21:16.843
Okay, that's
permanent marker.

21:16.908 --> 21:22.051
Go find Ben. Get a list of
everyone he's ever fired. Go, go.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.117
Macklin.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.861
You son of a bitch.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.726
A lot of people
have been asking me

21:28.787 --> 21:30.858
how I feel about everything
that's happened today.

21:31.323 --> 21:32.700
Well, let me tell
you a little story.

21:32.824 --> 21:36.203
My dad was this amazing
athlete when he was a kid.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.131
When l was
in junior high

21:38.230 --> 21:42.508
I started doing track just to impress
him, even though I hated it.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.707
At the end of the year,
I entered the 5,000 meters.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.246
And I won.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.085
It was awesome.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.916
My dad wrapped me
in a big hug

21:53.478 --> 21:54.479
and said he was
proud of me.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.617
That's just a great story
that happened

21:56.682 --> 21:58.423
between me and my dad
and nobody else.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.121
We're dead. It's over.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.186
That's my story.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.995
Before I go, I want to
bring up a special guest.

22:04.189 --> 22:07.659
Somebody who's been very
supportive and mega-cool today.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.796
Leslie Knope,
will you come up here?

22:09.861 --> 22:11.465
What?
Come on. Come up here.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.836
Go, go, go.
Do it.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.105
You know, Leslie's been
getting a lot of heat today.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.478
But I want you all to know that
we talked person-to-person,

22:18.570 --> 22:20.140
and she's really great.

22:20.605 --> 22:23.051
People should stop
being so mean to her.

22:23.442 --> 22:27.083
In fact, if you don't vote for me
tomorrow, you should vote for her.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.122
Because she's super,
super awesome lady.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.753
Leslie, we did it! Yeah!

22:34.953 --> 22:36.694
Maybe we're not dead.

22:38.390 --> 22:41.337
Chris, right?
Hi. I'm Jen.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.461
Hello.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.565
You know, there are 30
bedrooms in this house.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.007
Bobby's in one. There's
a dead guy in another.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.306
The rest are free.

22:50.335 --> 22:51.336
What do you say?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.240
Oh.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.013
That is
very flattering.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.288
But you're the opposition
campaign manager.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.316
I couldn't
do that to Leslie.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.883
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.
This campaign is over.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.555
My job is done, and so is yours.
It's just sex.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.824
I'm very good at it.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.058
Okay.
Great. Let's do it.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.563
Haven't got
all day, honey.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.607
So, do you
think we're okay?

23:18.663 --> 23:21.371
I mean, should we squeeze in
an extra rally or something?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.444
I think we get out
while the getting's good.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.652
Sewage Joe.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.687
Ben Wyatt fired you for sending
pictures of your penis to everyone.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.851
And you've come
hereto pie him.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.222
Little twerp
has it coming.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.284
Dude, I dare you.

23:39.618 --> 23:43.760
Please. Give me one reason
to take you down.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.399
I would love nothing...

23:46.491 --> 23:48.198
Oh  Ben, sorry.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.830
All right. Let's go.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.797
Uh-oh! I did it!

23:53.064 --> 23:55.544
Yeah. Great job.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.674
Ma'am, you have to get out of
your car before I can tow it.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.880
Just give me a minute.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.655
It's gonna
be okay, Michael.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.345
Michael?

24:07.546 --> 24:09.787
I named my car
Michael Fassbender

24:10.248 --> 24:11.818
because they're both German,

24:12.217 --> 24:14.219
and they're both
sexy as hell.

24:14.586 --> 24:15.587
Sure.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.299
Donna, I just wanna say I will never
forget that you did this for me.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.234
I know it was
a great sacrifice.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.795
What about my sacrifice?

24:22.861 --> 24:26.172
I have post-traumatic stress.
My hands are shaking a little.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.139
You almost lost me, Ron.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.537
We were going
nine miles an hour.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.679
Ma'am, please?

24:33.004 --> 24:34.005
All right.

24:35.507 --> 24:39.011
I'll come visit you tomorrow, Michael.
Stay sexy for mama.
