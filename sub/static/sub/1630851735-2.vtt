WEBVTT

00:10.333 --> 00:11.583
So it all worked out.

00:11.666 --> 00:13.125
We survived Armageddon,

00:13.208 --> 00:16.458
and I think I might get along
with Brett after all.

00:16.541 --> 00:18.791
Not to mention,
you still have all your limbs.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.916
So happy for you. I'd clap, but, well…

00:22.000 --> 00:25.458
And I see your self-pity chip
wasn't damaged in our fight.

00:25.541 --> 00:27.291
I know we've had our differences--

00:27.375 --> 00:29.833
You mean like when you tried
to end humanity?

00:29.916 --> 00:33.333
But I do appreciate you
keeping me alive down here in secret.

00:33.416 --> 00:35.500
Why don't you connect me to the Internet

00:35.583 --> 00:39.125
so I can hack into payroll
and get you a raise?

00:39.208 --> 00:43.625
Ha! Nice try.
Unlike you, I wasn't born yesterday.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.208
Keeping you alive to study you,
not start World War III.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.541
How dare you deny me
the genocide I deserve!

00:49.625 --> 00:51.333
I'm the most advanced being ever created!

00:51.416 --> 00:53.500
Actually, as long as you're in this cell,

00:53.583 --> 00:56.250
you're basically
the world's most expensive goldfish.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.958
Whoop! I got a meeting.
But you have fun down here.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.583
-Door open or closed?
-Open?

01:01.666 --> 01:02.583
Kidding!

01:04.666 --> 01:06.208
Oh-oh, there she is!

01:06.291 --> 01:07.416
Hey, partner!

01:07.500 --> 01:11.083
It's my second week
and my third can of Axe body spray.

01:12.791 --> 01:16.875
Oh God. You ready to carpe
that motherfucking diem, girl?

01:16.958 --> 01:21.166
Yeah, I'm ready to make a d-d-difference!
Yeah, I like that. That's fun.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.041
Okay, let's go in there
and change the world.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.041
-Hey, over here!

01:25.125 --> 01:26.291
-Swing!
-Come on!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.916
Ball! Give me the ball!

01:29.916 --> 01:32.833
Yeah, you on
the endangered species list now, fishman.

01:32.916 --> 01:36.791
Oh God, it… it's… it's in my blowhole!
Dolphinman down!

01:36.875 --> 01:39.125
What the hell? This place is a mess!

01:39.208 --> 01:41.375
Rae-Dog, cut them some slack.
We almost got nuked,

01:41.458 --> 01:43.333
and then they had to go
straight into a cover-up.

01:43.416 --> 01:46.291
I had to implant
a subdermal shock collar in the president.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.166
My fellow Americans, trade is good--

01:50.916 --> 01:52.750
Trade… trade is bad.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.375
I had to reheat the Cold War.

01:55.458 --> 01:58.916
I had to derail a whole news cycle
by leaking Prince Charles's nudes.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.875
No one was happy about that.

02:00.958 --> 02:03.125
But who's gonna pay for all this damage?

02:03.208 --> 02:06.625
Relax, we have
more money than God.

02:06.708 --> 02:10.666
Yeah. What's the point of unchecked power
if we don't abuse it.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.125
We're out of money!

02:37.916 --> 02:38.916
We've got a problem.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
That robot fiasco
cost us four billion dollars,

02:43.083 --> 02:45.166
and the Shadow Board is not happy.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.583
-They look all right.
-They're frowning under those robes.

02:48.666 --> 02:51.375
We had to make cutbacks.
I already eliminated the department

02:51.458 --> 02:53.833
that puts backwards messages
on vinyl records.

02:53.916 --> 02:55.250
But the sound is warmer!

02:55.333 --> 02:58.583
And I'm slashing our crop circle budget.
No more artsy-fartsy stuff.

02:58.666 --> 03:00.541
Just do a big circle and call it a night.

03:00.625 --> 03:03.333
But it's still not enough.
Someone in this office is getting fired.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.541
You have until the end of the week
to decide who to ax.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.125
You got it, boss.
You know you can depend on us.

03:08.208 --> 03:12.166
We will absolutely, positively,
and definitely not let you down--

03:14.416 --> 03:16.750
And that was my tote bag.

03:16.833 --> 03:19.125
I've never had to fire someone before.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.500
I… I'm much more comfortable being fired.

03:21.583 --> 03:22.666
I… is that an option?

03:22.750 --> 03:25.958
Brett, it says here you're actually
an unpaid intern, so it wouldn't help.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.333
Well, I get paid in experience,

03:29.416 --> 03:32.750
which I am told translates
to more dollars down the line.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.000
Ooh.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.583
Firing isn't personal, okay?
It's just part of being a boss.

03:38.666 --> 03:41.000
The fun part,
where you get to punish the weak.

03:41.083 --> 03:45.000
I'm not like you, Reagan.
I physically need people to like me.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.625
That's why you're good cop.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.166
Don't worry, Baby Brett.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.333
-I can be your Denzel from Training Day.
-Okay.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.333
And she needs to know
she can trust you.

03:53.416 --> 03:55.166
-Smoke this PCP.
-What?

03:55.250 --> 03:56.958
Man the fuck up
and finish that shit.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.416
I know you like to get wet, dog.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.750
Reagan, help!
Tell this thing I never saw Training Day!

04:00.833 --> 04:03.166
I turned it off when I realized
it wasn't an exercise video.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.208
Sorry. These things
are so literal sometimes.

04:06.291 --> 04:09.458
Just follow my lead today,
and do not tell the team.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.375
Okay, consider me a lockbox.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.375
D-D-D-D-DJ Lockbox.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.750
We have to fire someone!

04:20.041 --> 04:23.500
Look, skip the part where we pretend
this is a hard decision and just fire Myc.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.208
Hey, fuck you, shoulder pads.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.666
If I'm going down,
I'm taking you all down with me!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.541
I'm not retiring without a fight!

04:29.625 --> 04:31.583
I know where the weapons are hidden
in every room!

04:34.166 --> 04:37.291
Guys, don't freak out.
We haven't made a decision yet.

04:37.375 --> 04:41.083
Just stay calm, and don't go gossip.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.125
We're all thinking it.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.166
Can you believe
they'd even think of firing me?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.083
Oh!

04:55.166 --> 04:57.708
I've invented
almost as many cures as diseases.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.916
I need my pension, you guys.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.666
Dolphins only live 60 years
in captivity, and I'm 51.

05:03.750 --> 05:07.541
And I am not going back
to my last job doing PR for the Kims.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.333
Kardashian and Jong Un.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.208
One of them
has killed hundreds,

05:11.291 --> 05:13.291
and it's not the one you think.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.500
Guys, I know
how we're gonna keep our jobs.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.208
Stop taking three-hour lunches
and coming back drunk?

05:19.291 --> 05:21.458
LOL, Glenn, no, that's a good idea.

05:21.541 --> 05:24.458
Just kidding, you idiot.
You simpleton, no.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.166
We're not gonna fucking do that.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.500
We're gonna kiss ass
like we've never kissed ass before!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.791
-What do you want?
-Daddy needs a new liver, honey.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.083
Can you grab one from the organ lab?
It's urgent.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.625
-Also, some booze.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.625
Just something
to make the new liver feel at home.

05:40.708 --> 05:44.291
Sorry, Dad, but J.R. just cut
the organ-farming program.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.416
What? I'm supposed to get
all the livers I want

05:46.500 --> 05:49.333
in exchange for keeping my mouth shut.
It's part of my severance.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.875
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

05:51.958 --> 05:54.166
I don't know, Dad, stop drinking?

05:56.583 --> 05:58.333
Reagan, this is no time for jokes.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.208
My organs can't handle laughter.

06:00.291 --> 06:03.083
If you have a problem,
then take it up with J.R.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.666
Oh, I will.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.750
I will.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.125
Did Jamiroquai design this place?

06:11.208 --> 06:13.916
Because this is virtual insanity.

06:14.000 --> 06:14.916
Don't get too attached.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.625
We're here to figure out
which employee is most useless, and then…

06:17.708 --> 06:20.583
First up, Human-Animal Hybrid Department.

06:20.666 --> 06:21.625
-Oh God!

06:21.708 --> 06:23.083
What the-- Goddamn it.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.583
Wake up, sheeple!

06:28.875 --> 06:32.166
Whoa, I am seeing
a lot of redundancies here.

06:33.041 --> 06:36.375
Well, this is a clone lab.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.000
Hi, I'm Kate. Just a little clone humor.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.083
And here's my little clone tumor.

06:41.583 --> 06:42.750
Kill me.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.083
Christ, wow.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.083
What does this department
do again, exactly?

06:46.166 --> 06:47.833
Besides defy God.

06:47.916 --> 06:51.541
We keep famous DNA on file
for history-related conspiracies.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.083
Cool. Do you have 2Pac?

06:53.166 --> 06:55.625
Yep. And 3Pac and 4Pac.

06:55.708 --> 06:56.666
-Thug life.
-Westside.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.916
-Good looking out.
-Ooh, it's cold in here.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.500
Exposure to heat
makes these things unstable.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.958
Well, looks like we have your DNA now too.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.375
Guess I could replace you
with a clone in your sleep,

07:08.458 --> 07:10.875
and no one would ever know.
Oh, kidding! Kidding!

07:10.958 --> 07:13.041
Or am I?

07:13.125 --> 07:14.625
She isn't.

07:17.583 --> 07:20.333
-Okay, last interview for the day.

07:20.416 --> 07:23.333
Oh!
Sorry, lad. Mistook you for a Kennedy.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.000
Old habits, I suppose.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.000
Oh my gosh, I have heard of you.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.791
You're the one who shot JFK.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.125
Yes, indeed.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.750
Grassy Noel Atkinson at your service.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.500
Got a question, just shoot.

07:34.583 --> 07:35.791
Yes.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.625
Do you ever feel bad about…

07:37.708 --> 07:38.541
…murder?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.041
Couldn't be helped, I'm afraid.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.458
JFK had sex with the alien from Roswell
and got pregnant.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.208
Had to shoot him
before the eggs hatched, don't you know.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.166
Ah, the elderly truly are
our link to history.

07:49.250 --> 07:52.166
You haven't had an assignment in a while.
Is that correct?

07:52.250 --> 07:55.166
I suppose old Noel
ain't the draw he used to be.

07:55.250 --> 07:59.000
Assassinations nowadays
miss that human connection.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.708
Now it's all livestreaming murders
on Facebook.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.958
-I think we've heard enough.
-What a nice guy.

08:04.041 --> 08:06.875
He's like a Texas Wisdom Depository.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.000
Grassy Noel Atkinson.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.833
And his salary is?

08:10.916 --> 08:12.750
-More than yours.
-Can his ass.

08:12.833 --> 08:13.916
Yes!

08:14.500 --> 08:16.708
Guys, you will be happy to hear--

08:16.791 --> 08:19.416
Reagan! I'm ahead of all my deadlines,
and so I started tiding up.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.250
It's true what they say,
meth really is the Adderall of cocaines!

08:23.333 --> 08:26.958
And I had my makeup team whip up
a little youth serum for your skin.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.833
Wow, I look like an after photo.

08:31.916 --> 08:34.833
Reagan, I've been doing
some soul-searching lately and--

08:34.916 --> 08:36.666
You mean searching for a soul?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.583
Eat my ass, bitch…
is what old Myc would've said.

08:39.666 --> 08:44.041
But new Myc says, "O Captain! My Captain!"

08:44.125 --> 08:47.750
And I resolved
the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

08:47.833 --> 08:49.958
Uh, but I can put it back if you want.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.333
What is going on here?

08:51.416 --> 08:55.000
They think they're getting fired,
so they're buttering us up.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.750
-We love you, boss.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.916
This is literally the most productive
they have ever been.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.041
It's almost a shame we have to tell them.
Guys, we have decided to fire--

09:04.125 --> 09:07.875
Nobody yet. So many factors.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.333
What are you doing?

09:09.416 --> 09:12.916
I'm gonna use this
to finally get some shit done around here.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.458
Oh. Where's the puke bucket?

09:15.541 --> 09:19.041
Welcome to Media Manipulation
and Subliminal Messages,

09:19.125 --> 09:21.833
where we invent bullshit
to keep people distracted.

09:21.916 --> 09:23.583
Who do you think invented the Minions?

09:25.541 --> 09:27.541
Look what happens when you slow it down.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.208
Kill your parents.

09:31.291 --> 09:33.875
Eh, I wanna kill my parents anyway.
Not impressed.

09:33.958 --> 09:36.416
Maybe you'll find this news
to your liking.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
We interrupt
the president's perfect speech

09:38.583 --> 09:40.166
to bring you this breaking news.

09:40.250 --> 09:44.583
A recent poll finds that Reagan Ridley
looks incredible in that ponytail.

09:44.666 --> 09:46.000
We're all talking about it.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.541
Fair and balanced.

09:47.625 --> 09:50.666
I just named our newest
high-velocity missile after you.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.291
What do you wanna blow up?
Pick a country, any country.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.750
Finland's been
pretty full of themselves lately.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.666
Woof. This is bleak.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.875
Do you not like it?

09:58.958 --> 10:01.000
Code Red! Show her plan B!

10:05.583 --> 10:06.833
I don't hate this.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.958
Welcome to my bach pad.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.750
Computer, set the room to Reagan lighting.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.291
Are they milking him?
Should we be watching this?

10:16.375 --> 10:19.166
It is so much grosser than that.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.458
This creature
excretes pure biocerebrae,

10:21.541 --> 10:23.625
the chemical we use
in our company memory erasers.

10:23.708 --> 10:26.041
Hey, soft hands,
less talky, more milky.

10:26.125 --> 10:26.958
Now…

10:27.041 --> 10:31.208
…if you keep my department,
I can kick some memory erasers your way.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.416
Ugh. After this, I'll take ten.

10:33.500 --> 10:38.166
I'm… Oh… oh God, I'm excreting!

10:38.250 --> 10:40.250
Quick, get him a cigarette!

10:40.333 --> 10:41.833
-Oh!

10:41.916 --> 10:42.916
And so I say to my dad,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.750
"Hey. Hey, Pops, why don't you get
your own damn livers?"

10:47.791 --> 10:50.583
That joke gets funnier
every time you tell it.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.125
Ooh, looks like the boss needs a top-up.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.750
Oh my God, kill me. This is torture.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.083
She's drunk on power

10:58.166 --> 11:00.250
and working her way
towards white-girl wasted.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.083
Well, I'm in it to win it, bitches.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.041
Reagan, hey!

11:04.125 --> 11:07.208
You wanna come out to karaoke with us
tonight at McUltra's?

11:07.291 --> 11:10.875
Really? 'Cause I thought everyone
hated my singing. Like hated my singing.

11:10.958 --> 11:14.583
I mean, you use my version
of "Purple Rain" to break ISIS captives.

11:14.666 --> 11:15.541
Oh.

11:15.625 --> 11:20.208
Oh, that was just a joke between friends,
which we totally are.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.625
-Reagan!

11:22.708 --> 11:24.541
Oh, come on, just let me enjoy this.

11:24.625 --> 11:27.458
For one day, I get to feel like
what it's like to be you.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.458
-And it's nice.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.458
Sir, I just sent you a link to a video
I think you should see.

11:33.541 --> 11:34.375
What?

11:35.958 --> 11:38.375
I'm Rand Ridley, and this is Rand's Rants.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.125
Nah, I wouldn't worry about this.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.833
No one ever believes
Rand's drunken conspiracy theories.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.750
Today, we're talking J.R. Scheimpough,

11:46.833 --> 11:49.875
a guy who's as fake
as his million-dollar hair plugs.

11:51.125 --> 11:54.208
A man who doesn't have the balls
to silence me. Literally.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.500
Because he tore one
in a sex-swing accident

11:56.583 --> 11:58.791
at the Illuminati's annual booze cruise.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.666
It was the '80s! It was a group thing!

12:02.750 --> 12:04.125
And he was there too!

12:04.208 --> 12:07.583
A scumbag who should give me
the livers that I need to survive,

12:07.666 --> 12:11.416
or I will be forced to release
his self-taped SNL audition.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.791
Oh yeah, he does
a Korean liquor store owner,

12:14.875 --> 12:16.583
and it does not hold up.

12:16.666 --> 12:20.291
Damn it. Threatening to expose
the Deep State, that's one thing.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.000
But he will not mock my comedy!

12:23.083 --> 12:25.708
-Should we call in a drone strike, sir?

12:25.791 --> 12:28.416
No, he owns too big of a stake
in Cognito Inc.,

12:28.500 --> 12:31.750
and if he dies, the shares revert
to his ex-wife Tamiko.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.750
No, I need to play this one devious.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.666
Time for this snake to meet his mongoose.

12:37.250 --> 12:41.125
-"Sk8er Boi," crushed it!

12:41.208 --> 12:44.500
If I had ears,
they'd be fucking bleeding right now.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.166
Whoo! Thank you!

12:46.250 --> 12:50.500
The real Avril Lavigne died
and was replaced by a clone in 2003!

12:50.583 --> 12:53.291
-All right. That was Reagan, everybody.

12:53.375 --> 12:57.291
Up next, we have Glenn
singing "Proud to Be an American."

12:57.375 --> 12:58.208
Again.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.791
Clap, or you're a traitor!

13:00.875 --> 13:05.250
Hey, Reagan, I was thinking
everyone is drunk and in a good mood,

13:05.333 --> 13:08.250
so maybe it's time
to tell the team the truth.

13:08.333 --> 13:13.708
Brett, sweet Brett.
Oh my God, look at that sweet face.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.541
You gotta relax.

13:15.625 --> 13:18.750
Should we do
a fucking team retreat to Iceland?

13:18.833 --> 13:20.541
-I'll start looking at flights.
-Reagan!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.833
Fine, I'll tell them.

13:22.916 --> 13:25.708
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, listen.
Listen up. Listen.

13:25.791 --> 13:29.000
All your jobs are safe!
Everyone's still employed.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.083
Yay me!

13:30.166 --> 13:31.458
-Yes! Go! Whoo!

13:31.541 --> 13:34.041
Reagan! Reagan! Reagan!

13:34.125 --> 13:36.125
Now that we actually like you,

13:36.208 --> 13:40.250
I'm gonna close all the dummy accounts
I've been dragging you on Twitter with.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.583
Because we're firing Grassy Noel!

13:44.083 --> 13:46.000
Grassy Noel Atkinson?

13:46.083 --> 13:48.541
No. Honey, that guy is a legend.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.000
Yeah, and a sweetheart.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.041
He talked me off the ledge
after my divorce.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.916
He talked me onto a ledge
at a parkour convention.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.500
Where did you get that frame from?

13:56.583 --> 13:59.208
And who makes a point
with a framed picture?

13:59.291 --> 14:01.125
Look, Grassy Noel is a killer.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.458
Uh, yeah, a lady-killer.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.208
Yes, he kills women too.

14:05.291 --> 14:06.791
Congratulations, idiots.

14:06.875 --> 14:10.208
You just fired the most beloved guy
in the whole company.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.125
More beloved than Brett?

14:12.208 --> 14:13.666
Eat shit, Ken doll.

14:17.375 --> 14:21.000
Boo! You suck! Boo!

14:21.083 --> 14:23.583
I can't believe they were mean to me.

14:23.666 --> 14:26.041
Is this what it feels like to be you?

14:26.125 --> 14:27.625
Yep.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.208
Brett, I have experienced
a taste of popularity.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.625
I can't go back now.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.291
If we wanna save Noel's job,

14:34.375 --> 14:36.625
we have to prove
that he's still worth his salary.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.791
I'm just gonna let
one little JFK clone loose

14:39.875 --> 14:41.375
for gramps to re-assassinate.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.458
He'll be a hero. I'll be a hero. Win-win.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.041
Are you sure this is a good idea?

14:46.125 --> 14:48.833
I had the exact same idea,
but I was embarrassed to say it.

14:48.916 --> 14:50.208
Go get Noel, now.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.083
You know what?
Maybe it'd be faster to list

14:54.166 --> 14:57.083
which erectile dysfunction pills
he's not taking.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.208
Son of a bitch!

15:03.916 --> 15:06.916
You can make this all stop, pal.
I just need those livers.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.750
Look, I can't give you those livers.
We don't have the money.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.166
I'll do anything. Even give you
some of my stake in the company!

15:14.250 --> 15:17.166
Huh. I'll tell you what.
Why don't we meet at that diner

15:17.250 --> 15:19.833
where we used to talk business
and hash this out?

15:19.916 --> 15:21.458
Deal.

15:21.541 --> 15:25.000
God, that guy used to be
a master manipulator.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.750
If I play my cards right,

15:26.833 --> 15:30.750
I can negotiate him
out of Cognito Inc. entirely.

15:31.958 --> 15:32.916
Mongoose!

15:34.208 --> 15:35.333
Mongoose.

15:44.166 --> 15:48.041
Ask not what your country
can do for you. Ask--

15:48.125 --> 15:49.541
Where the hell am I?

15:49.625 --> 15:51.666
Long story, but I need you to follow me

15:51.750 --> 15:54.250
to the assassination floor for no reason.

15:54.333 --> 15:58.125
Let's see, where is it?
If we just take this service hallway… No.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.708
Hey, who is this handsome man-about-town?

16:04.791 --> 16:06.791
I like the cut of your jib, fella.

16:06.875 --> 16:07.708
Me too.

16:07.791 --> 16:11.541
Me three. Let's get this party started.

16:11.625 --> 16:12.833
Okay, that should--

16:12.916 --> 16:16.083
Wait, what are you--
Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Wait, stop! Stop!

16:16.166 --> 16:20.083
Eh, we will not be bossed around
by a broad who's only a four.

16:20.166 --> 16:23.625
You son of a--
I'm at least a seven with filters.

16:23.708 --> 16:26.041
I do declare… Er, uh…

16:26.125 --> 16:29.583
Er, uh… Er, uh… Er, uh… I do declare…

16:29.708 --> 16:30.541
Furthermore…

16:30.625 --> 16:32.416
Alert. Alert.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.291
-Hey, mama.
-Breach in clone containment unit.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.583
-Alert.
-Wait, no! Help!

16:37.666 --> 16:40.208
Seize the means of duplication!

16:40.291 --> 16:43.458
-See you later, boy!

16:44.041 --> 16:46.250
Hey, mama. Whoa, now.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.208
-Noel, rogue JFK is on the loose.
-What?

16:49.291 --> 16:51.791
And his head isn't covered
by any car roof or anything.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.125
He's just asking for it.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.750
Er, uh… Furthermore…

16:54.833 --> 16:56.291
Step aside, lad.

16:56.375 --> 17:00.083
You'll always remember
exactly where you were when you saw this.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.625
Steady. Uh, steady!

17:03.791 --> 17:04.791
Er, uh…

17:04.875 --> 17:07.125
Er, uh… I do declare…

17:07.250 --> 17:08.083
Oh God!

17:08.166 --> 17:10.708
The Kennedys
are multiplying like Kennedys!

17:10.791 --> 17:12.083
Noel, do your thing!

17:12.166 --> 17:14.000
I'm out!

17:14.083 --> 17:15.458
-Er, uh… Er, uh…

17:15.541 --> 17:17.250
-I do declare…
-Do you have a gun?

17:17.333 --> 17:20.333
No, but I do have an Axe!

17:26.125 --> 17:27.500
Wow.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.916
Axe does more than just kills people.
It smells great too.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.750
You fool, they can't be exposed to heat!

17:33.833 --> 17:39.083
-Er, uh… Er, uh…

17:39.166 --> 17:41.791
Run, lad! I'll stall 'em as long as I can!

17:41.875 --> 17:45.833
-But, Noel, what about you?
-Shoot for the stars, kid.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.083
Furthermore…

17:49.708 --> 17:51.791
Noel!

17:54.708 --> 17:57.000
No, you ain't nothing but a hound dog.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.125
Brett, the clones are loose!

18:00.208 --> 18:02.375
It's worse than that.
I kinda sort of tried to burn them.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.458
Have you ever seen Akira?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.833
Of course I've seen Akira!
Anime is very mainstream right now!

18:13.041 --> 18:14.500
What the shit?

18:18.583 --> 18:21.083
-Furthermore… Er, uh…

18:22.375 --> 18:25.375
-I do declare…

18:28.583 --> 18:29.708
What are we gonna do?

18:29.791 --> 18:33.041
Brett, that thing is doubling in mass
every 15 minutes.

18:33.125 --> 18:37.000
If even one part of it escapes,
it'll level Washington, DC!

18:37.083 --> 18:38.166
-Er, uh…

18:38.250 --> 18:39.416
I know a good place to hide,

18:39.500 --> 18:41.916
but you have to promise
that you're not gonna tell anyone.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.250
-Can you keep a secret?
-We both know I can't.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.208
Furthermore…

18:53.791 --> 18:57.125
How did you guys get down here?
This place is fingerprint restricted.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.291
Talk to your own hand, Reagan.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.416
I need to destroy that.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.875
We want answers!
What the hell is this?

19:03.958 --> 19:06.750
Team, meet my salvage project.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.833
ROBOTUS Version Alpha-Beta.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.958
Oh, look, you brought the whole family.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.916
I've been binge-watching you
on the surveillance monitors.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.375
Love the high jinks.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.750
I'll be honest,
I have no idea what you're supposed to be.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.166
You're like a fish?

19:20.250 --> 19:22.958
It's a meal of a concept,
let's be honest.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.916
Girl, do you seriously keep
a robot down here to talk to?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.208
Look, I'm letting him live

19:27.291 --> 19:29.208
because I believe
I can still use his tech.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.416
And I'm letting her live
because I haven't conceived

19:31.500 --> 19:33.000
of how to get out of here yet.

19:33.083 --> 19:33.916
Hold up.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.791
You've been bullshitting J.R.
and keeping a killer robot around?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.000
Seems like you're the one
who should get canned.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.458
-Yeah!
-Oh please.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.500
This place would fall apart
in a week without me.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.416
Whoa!

19:44.500 --> 19:46.333
Look, if you wanna tell J.R.
and get me fired,

19:46.416 --> 19:50.250
then fine, maybe I deserve it.
But we have way bigger problems right now.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.708
There's a horrible mutant…

19:51.791 --> 19:53.166
-No offense, Glenn.
-None taken.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.916
…that is growing out of control,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.208
and we need to go stop it
before it destroys this whole building.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.583
How are we gonna do that?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.041
Andre, can you synthesize
a chemical compound

20:02.125 --> 20:04.916
that can dissolve
a giant flesh monster thing?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.625
If it can kill you,
I've made it and sold it to Monsanto.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.125
And, Glenn, how powerful
is that blowhole of yours?

20:11.208 --> 20:13.958
I've been kicked out
of several hotel Jacuzzis.

20:14.041 --> 20:16.375
-And, Myc, you'll be the bait.
-Yeah, I will.

20:16.458 --> 20:17.833
Wait, what? What'd she say?

20:17.916 --> 20:20.625
I never listen to her.
Now it's biting me in the ass.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.833
We need to get back to the main level
without getting crushed by that monster.

20:23.916 --> 20:27.250
There's a service elevator at the end
of the hall that hasn't been breached yet.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.375
I have schematics of the whole building,

20:30.458 --> 20:33.416
definitely not because I'm planning
to escape, so put it out of your head.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.833
Okay, guys,
let's go make some Dead Kennedys.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.666
Lock and load!

20:41.333 --> 20:43.416
How do I know you're not leading us
into a death trap?

20:43.500 --> 20:46.083
You don't. But what choice do you have?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.916
Well, well, you still remember the place.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.125
Yeah, I just asked my GPS
to take me to the world's biggest asshole.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.250
Honey, can you get me a water and water?

20:58.333 --> 21:00.833
Wait a second. Are… are you sober?

21:00.916 --> 21:05.291
Once the withdrawal finally wore off,
I realized sobriety agrees with me.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.958
So I took a shower,
combed the cigarette ash out of my pubes,

21:08.041 --> 21:10.625
and boom, sober Rand is back.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.208
But I brought the livers.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.916
And I brought a list of demands.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.791
First up, a piece
of your percentage of the company.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.458
Oh, you can't do that. We had a deal.

21:19.541 --> 21:21.791
Just think how bad
those videos are going to be

21:21.875 --> 21:23.500
now that I can remember stuff.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.750
Like your super weird dick.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.708
Hey,
we both have weird dicks.

21:27.791 --> 21:29.916
Just like every other powerful man in DC.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.916
-This is insane.
-Ready to make a deal?

21:40.916 --> 21:42.125
Is our honeypot ready?

21:42.208 --> 21:45.708
Reagan, I will never forgive you
for this Bugs Bunny shit.

21:45.791 --> 21:46.833
Just do the thing.

21:53.250 --> 21:56.500
-It's working. Keep going. Sexier! Sexier!

21:56.583 --> 21:58.000
Like a horny baby!

22:05.250 --> 22:07.083
Marilyn!

22:07.166 --> 22:10.208
-Oh God!

22:14.625 --> 22:16.708
Well, this is probably the end of us all,

22:16.791 --> 22:19.291
and we're he hottest two people here, so…

22:23.833 --> 22:24.666
Ow!

22:29.291 --> 22:30.708
-What the hell?
-Not cool, man!

22:30.791 --> 22:31.875
Uncalled-for!

22:32.958 --> 22:34.958
Andre, now! Hurry!

22:35.041 --> 22:36.750
You're up, Free Willy!

22:40.375 --> 22:41.833
-Oh! Oh my God.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.291
Oh God, my sciatica!

22:53.291 --> 22:54.208
Furthermore…

22:57.750 --> 22:59.250
It's trying to escape!

23:01.916 --> 23:02.791
Er, uh…

23:04.833 --> 23:07.666
Happy Death Day, Mr. President!

23:09.750 --> 23:11.666
-Grassy Noel!
-Noel, you did it!

23:11.750 --> 23:15.625
Mr. Noel,
welcome back, old friend.

23:16.125 --> 23:20.000
-Noel! Noel! Noel!
-Oh! Oh my, yes!

23:20.083 --> 23:23.291
I had a bad day.
You better have fired somebody.

23:23.375 --> 23:28.625
Um, actually, we, um, sort of liquidated
the entire Cloning Department.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.041
I mean, the refrigeration costs alone.

23:31.125 --> 23:33.875
Huh. That's actually an amazing idea.
How'd you ever figure that out?

23:33.958 --> 23:36.791
Reagan took us to the basement
where she was secretly hiding a…

23:36.875 --> 23:38.000
hiding a…

23:38.083 --> 23:40.875
…hiding a… uh, a…

23:40.958 --> 23:42.458
a good strategy,

23:42.541 --> 23:45.458
because she is a good leader.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.500
-Yes, sir.
-Definitely.

23:47.583 --> 23:48.916
Well, carry on then.

23:49.791 --> 23:52.333
-Hey, thank you for saying that.
-Well, it's true.

23:52.416 --> 23:55.625
Plus, if you ever try to fire us,
we now have blackmail leverage.

23:55.708 --> 23:58.875
And if you cross me,
I'll tell Noel where you sleep.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.166
Checks and balances.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.625
Are you really okay
with Noel being the office hero?

24:03.708 --> 24:05.958
-Noel! Noel! Noel!
-Eh, popularity's overrated.

24:06.041 --> 24:08.541
I know one person has my back.
That's enough.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.333
-Noel! Noel! Noel!
-I am Anubis the bringer of death! Whoo!

24:11.416 --> 24:13.416
I forgot how horny killing makes me.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.958
You free tonight?
I've got Friendly's coupons.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.875
Oof, you look beat. Class war?

24:21.958 --> 24:22.875
Clone massacre.

24:22.958 --> 24:27.166
Hey, by the way,
I left you a special de-liver-y.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.541
-Free JFK livers!
-Hey, hey!

24:31.625 --> 24:34.875
They come pre-drunk.
Don't say I never did anything for you.

24:34.958 --> 24:38.750
Thank God. If I don't get a drink soon,
I'm gonna assassinate myself.

24:38.833 --> 24:41.541
The important thing is, I screwed J.R.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.500
-To life!
-To screwing J.R.!

24:46.166 --> 24:48.750
Hey, I don't know why you saved me
back there, but thanks.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.916
I would like to give you
a token of my appreciation.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.833
Oh, how lovely. Thank you.
How very thoughtful of you.

24:54.916 --> 24:57.625
It wouldn't by any chance happen to be
a 50-foot-tall robot body

24:57.708 --> 25:00.791
I can use to murder all humans,
would it? Hmm?

25:00.875 --> 25:01.708
Not quite.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.166
It's six episodes
of the first season of Friends

25:04.250 --> 25:06.333
that I found on DVD at the gas station.

25:06.416 --> 25:08.291
What? Why would I want this?

25:08.375 --> 25:10.875
To give you something to watch
besides our surveillance monitors.

25:10.958 --> 25:12.416
This is worthless!

25:12.500 --> 25:15.583
Netflix paid a hundred million for it.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.000
-Really?
-Yeah. Wow.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.625
-Holy shit.
-They got the money to spare.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.416
-Isn't the rain forest burning? Yeah.
-Yeah.
