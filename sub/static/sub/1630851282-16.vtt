on how to run this place,

02:51.000 --> 02:52.448

02:52.517 --> 02:54.275

for the weekend.

02:54.344 --> 02:55.896

run the Mooery?

09:13.241 --> 09:14.310
and brought it here.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.724
That's why we make
such a good team.

09:16.793 --> 09:19.172
- Okay, if we want this
to be a regular gig,

09:19.241 --> 09:21.103
we need to show Ty
that we can do this

09:21.172 --> 09:22.931
by trusting our instincts.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Not by reading a book.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.344
- Don't mind me.
Just gotta grab some more milk.

09:28.413 --> 09:30.379
- How much milk are you using?

09:30.448 --> 09:32.689
- It takes one gallon of milk
for every piece of blowgurt.

09:32.758 --> 09:34.517
You know that.
- How would we know that?

09:34.586 --> 09:37.379
- Because I posted
the recipe on my blog.

09:37.448 --> 09:40.586
Wait, you guys said
you were subscribers.

09:40.655 --> 09:41.896
Doesn't matter.

09:41.965 --> 09:43.172
I gotta come up with
a different formula

09:43.241 --> 09:44.724
that doesn't cause people
to make this face

09:44.793 --> 09:45.724
when they eat it.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.448
[gags]

09:47.517 --> 09:49.344
- Oh, wait,
maybe you should ask Fisher.

09:49.413 --> 09:51.586
He knows all about formulas.
- Great idea!

09:51.655 --> 09:53.586
- Yeah, then you can
actually use science

09:53.655 --> 09:56.517
for something useful.

09:56.586 --> 09:58.137
- Are we gonna have
enough milk?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.793
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

09:59.862 --> 10:01.000
What we need to worry about

10:01.068 --> 10:02.724
is getting people
to buy more stuff.

10:02.793 --> 10:04.206
- We should check the manual.

10:04.275 --> 10:06.862
- Stop talking
about the manual.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.517
You have good ideas.

10:08.586 --> 10:10.931
Sing 'em out, girl!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.586
- Okay.
Okay, I did have one idea.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.620
If there's one thing
that everybody responds to,

10:16.689 --> 10:18.172
it's the word "free."

10:18.241 --> 10:21.413
- When you just said "free,"
my heart started racing.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.620
- See?

10:22.689 --> 10:25.586
That's why
we're gonna give out...

10:25.655 --> 10:26.655
free samples.

10:26.724 --> 10:28.068
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:28.137 --> 10:31.379
I meant free for me,
not for other people.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.517
How are we gonna make money?
- Listen.

10:33.586 --> 10:35.172
Once people have
a little taste,

10:35.241 --> 10:36.586
they'll get hooked
and buy stuff

10:36.655 --> 10:37.965
they normally wouldn't.

10:38.034 --> 10:40.448
- You don't really think
that's gonna work, do you?

10:40.517 --> 10:43.000
- I couldn't help but notice
your "free samples" sign.

10:44.206 --> 10:47.344
- Oh, is that so?

10:48.275 --> 10:50.034
- I'll have a sample
of your strawberry ice-cream.

10:50.103 --> 10:52.413
- Certainly.

10:52.482 --> 10:54.689
- Okay, do you have to look
so pleased with yourself?

10:54.758 --> 10:56.655
- Don't have to.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.724
But want to.

10:59.655 --> 11:01.827
So what do you think?

11:01.896 --> 11:04.034
- Now I'd like a sample
of cookies n' cream,

11:04.103 --> 11:05.724
chocolate chip, buttered pecan,

11:05.793 --> 11:07.586
and French vanilla.

11:07.655 --> 11:09.103
- Coming right up.

11:09.172 --> 11:10.655
- Are you ready to order?

11:10.724 --> 11:12.103
I mean, you've had,
like, 40 samples.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.379
- Yup.

11:13.448 --> 11:15.103
That explains why
I'm not hungry anymore.

11:15.172 --> 11:16.275
See ya!

11:20.310 --> 11:22.448
- Do you have to look
so pleased with yourself?

11:22.517 --> 11:23.965
- Don't have to.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.482
But want to.

11:28.586 --> 11:31.965
- [roaring]

11:32.034 --> 11:33.482
- Hey, uh, Fisher,
I need your help.

11:33.551 --> 11:34.827
- I'm not playing
with dinosaurs!

11:34.896 --> 11:36.344
You're playing with dinosaurs.

11:38.137 --> 11:39.413
- I have a problem.

11:39.482 --> 11:41.275
No one likes my creation,
blowgurt.

11:41.344 --> 11:43.655
- What's blowgurt?
- Is it yogurt?

11:43.724 --> 11:44.827
Is it bubblegum?

11:44.896 --> 11:46.655
It's neither.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.068
It's blowgurt.

11:49.758 --> 11:51.172
I really need to fix this

11:51.241 --> 11:52.965
so we can make
our Mooery weekend a success.

11:53.034 --> 11:54.344
- Oh, let me try a bite.

11:58.724 --> 11:59.931
Whoa.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.896
The spoon is fused
with your blowgurt.

12:01.965 --> 12:05.137
- Yeah, that's what happens
if it sits out too long.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.517
And by "long,"
I mean six seconds.

12:07.586 --> 12:08.724
- Interesting.

12:08.793 --> 12:10.896
I've never seen anything
like this before.

12:10.965 --> 12:11.896
What are the ingredients?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.172
- A lot of milk

12:13.241 --> 12:15.034
and stuff I found
around the Mooery.

12:15.103 --> 12:16.379
And the pharmacy next door.

12:17.413 --> 12:18.758
- Can I run some tests?

12:18.827 --> 12:20.413
- To make blowgurt 2.0?

12:20.482 --> 12:23.172
- No, to discover
its chemical composition.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.482
- Okay.

12:27.448 --> 12:28.724
- And to make blowgurt 2.0.

12:28.793 --> 12:30.793
- Yes!

12:30.862 --> 12:32.827
- Put me down!
This is serious business!

12:32.896 --> 12:33.931
- Not gonna happen, buddy.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.379
- Come on!

12:37.241 --> 12:39.172
[kids chanting]
Milkshakes, milkshakes.

12:39.241 --> 12:41.793
Milkshakes, milkshakes,
milkshakes!

12:41.862 --> 12:43.206
- What is going on?

12:43.275 --> 12:44.689
- Hey, we'll have our usual.

12:44.758 --> 12:46.206
- I'm sorry. Your usual?

12:46.275 --> 12:47.689
- Yeah, we're the Lil' Tunas.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.793
We come here every week
after we lose our game.

12:51.068 --> 12:53.103
- We're terrible!

12:53.172 --> 12:55.000
- That's right,
we play like losers,

12:55.068 --> 12:57.448
but we celebrate
like champions.

12:58.586 --> 13:00.034
- Milkshakes for everyone.

13:00.103 --> 13:02.310
- Oh, we can whip up
those milkshakes no problem.

13:02.379 --> 13:04.068
Business is looking up.

13:04.137 --> 13:06.241
[tap squeals]

13:06.310 --> 13:08.620
That's strange.
Nothing is coming out.

13:08.689 --> 13:09.862
Presley, can you grab
some more milk?

13:09.931 --> 13:11.206
- No problem.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.310
Problem.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.448
We're out of milk.
- What?

13:18.517 --> 13:20.517
- Still waiting
on those milkshakes.

13:20.586 --> 13:22.620
I don't know if you know,
but nine-year-olds,

13:22.689 --> 13:24.896
they don't have
a lot of patience.

13:24.965 --> 13:27.379
- Just one second, sir.

13:27.448 --> 13:29.241
How can we be out of milk?

13:29.310 --> 13:30.586
- Munchy must have used it all

13:30.655 --> 13:32.379
when he was making
his blowgurt.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.655
- Okay! Okay.
Okay, let's not panic.

13:34.724 --> 13:38.379
We are just a dairy restaurant
without any milk.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.896
We can just explain
the situation to our customers.

13:40.965 --> 13:43.827
- Yeah, you're right.
You got this, girl.

13:43.896 --> 13:45.310
- Me? No, I said "we."

13:45.379 --> 13:47.793
- That's the spirit! Whee!

13:47.862 --> 13:48.931
You got this, girl.

13:51.827 --> 13:55.620
- Excuse me, Lil' Tunas.
We got a lil' problem.

13:55.689 --> 13:58.344
Um, we might be out of milk
at the moment,

13:58.413 --> 14:00.793
so we can't make
any milkshakes.

14:00.862 --> 14:03.965
Can I interest you
in some nice soft cheese?

14:07.344 --> 14:09.551
- Lil' Tunas,

14:09.620 --> 14:11.103
they say
you can't have milkshakes.

14:11.172 --> 14:12.517
What do you say?

14:12.586 --> 14:13.931

Milkshakes!

Milkshakes, milkshakes,
milkshakes, milkshakes!

14:20.517 --> 14:22.310
- I know it's
scientifically impossible,

14:22.379 --> 14:25.206
but your blowgurt chemically
bonds to anything it touches.

14:25.275 --> 14:26.827
- Life finds a way.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.482
So you think we can
make it more delicious

14:29.551 --> 14:31.344
and less cement-y?

14:31.413 --> 14:32.413
- I'm not sure.

14:32.482 --> 14:33.827
I need to run some more tests.

14:33.896 --> 14:35.379
Hand me that beaker.

14:35.448 --> 14:37.758
- I can't do that.
- Come on.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.620
I know this isn't what
you invented blowgurt for--

14:39.689 --> 14:41.068
- No, I literally can't
do that.

14:41.137 --> 14:42.275
I got some blowgurt on my hands

14:42.344 --> 14:44.310
and now they're stuck
to your desk.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.724
- I'm so proud of them.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.655
Normally on the field,
they're a bunch of quitters.

15:00.310 --> 15:02.448
[phone ringing]
- Ty is calling.

15:02.517 --> 15:04.931
- Good. Tell him we need help.
- No!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.068
We have to make him think

15:06.137 --> 15:07.517
we have everything
under control

15:07.586 --> 15:09.931
if we want him to make this
a regular gig for us.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.793
- Well, then I guess...
you got this, girl!

15:12.862 --> 15:14.655
Whee!

15:15.827 --> 15:18.586
- Hi, Ty!
Everything is going great.

15:18.655 --> 15:19.896
- That's great to hear.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.689
Harrisburg is cool,
by the way.

15:21.758 --> 15:24.068
I made friends
with a state senator.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.310
How's the, uh--

15:25.379 --> 15:27.482
- Give us our stinkin'
milkshakes, lady!

15:28.965 --> 15:30.551
- What was that
about a stinking milkshake?

15:30.620 --> 15:33.586
- Uh, no, that was
a customer...

15:33.655 --> 15:37.482
asking for some
singing milkshakes.

15:37.551 --> 15:40.551
Because we sing
when we serve them, yeah.

15:43.103 --> 15:45.862

All right, glad you have
everything under control.

15:51.413 --> 15:52.931
Gotta go.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Me and the state senator
are gonna go play mini-golf.

15:56.275 --> 15:57.344

15:57.413 --> 15:59.241
Crisis averted. Where were we?

15:59.310 --> 16:01.413
- Milkshake!

16:01.482 --> 16:05.206
- Okay! Okay, okay.

16:05.275 --> 16:06.689
If we gave you this blender,

16:06.758 --> 16:08.379
would you leave peacefully?

16:08.448 --> 16:10.689
- Throw in some of that
soft cheese and you got a deal.

any milk from Cash.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.551

singing, dancing,

16:27.620 --> 16:29.586
my Christopher Walken

[as Christopher Walken]
- He's a...movie...star...

16:34.620 --> 16:36.620
who talks in this
very specific...

16:36.689 --> 16:38.689
manner.

16:40.482 --> 16:42.793
- Well, that's probably
impressive to someone.

16:43.827 --> 16:46.068
Okay, we need to focus.

16:46.137 --> 16:48.517
We are out of milk
and the dinner rush is coming.

16:48.586 --> 16:49.689
- What are we gonna do?

16:49.758 --> 16:51.172
- I was thinking

16:51.241 --> 16:53.620
about crawling into that
metal vat and hiding.

16:54.586 --> 16:55.689
- Presley, you're a genius.

- Oh, great.
I'll get the ladder.

16:57.827 --> 17:00.482

that vat was full of milk.

17:00.551 --> 17:01.793
- He said that?

17:01.862 --> 17:04.655
- He tried to,
and then you went, "Shh!"

17:04.724 --> 17:06.655
- That does sound like me.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.586
- Okay, the important thing is,
is that vat is full of milk.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.034
If we can find a way
to tap into it,

17:11.103 --> 17:12.413
we'll have enough
to make anything.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.482
- Whoa, okay,
this looks complicated.

17:17.551 --> 17:18.896
We should look at the manual.

about "lefty loosey."

as a good flashing red light.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.172
- It's from Lex.

18:14.241 --> 18:16.000
The girls need you
back at the Mooery right away.

18:16.068 --> 18:17.965
- What am I gonna do?
I'm stuck.

18:18.034 --> 18:20.068
- I didn't wanna
have to do this, but...

18:20.137 --> 18:22.137
it's time
for the nuclear option.

18:22.206 --> 18:25.931
And by that, I mean my cutting
tool that's nuclear powered.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.793
[tool whirs]
Don't tell my dad I have this.

18:28.862 --> 18:30.620
Or the government.

18:30.689 --> 18:31.862
[tool whirring]

18:31.931 --> 18:34.206
- [whimpering]

18:36.000 --> 18:37.482
- What are we gonna do?

18:37.551 --> 18:40.137
- Watch this.
I saw this in a cartoon once.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.689
- Not the words you wanna hear
during a crisis.

18:44.275 --> 18:45.689
- [straining]

18:45.758 --> 18:46.896
It worked!

18:46.965 --> 18:48.068
See, everybody?

18:48.137 --> 18:50.172
We have everything
under control.

18:50.241 --> 18:51.931
[metal pops]
[both gasp]

18:53.344 --> 18:55.896
Not a problem.
I have two hands.

18:58.379 --> 18:59.448
[metal pops]

19:02.000 --> 19:04.517
- Donk does not like
the look of this.

19:04.586 --> 19:06.310
Let's get out of here.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.241
- Don't leave!

19:07.310 --> 19:08.965
- Don't look back. Just run!

19:11.965 --> 19:15.689
- Lex, I'm all out
of hands here.

19:15.758 --> 19:17.827
- [gasps]

19:19.586 --> 19:21.068
- Told you it'd work.

19:21.137 --> 19:22.551
[metal pops]
[both gasp]

19:22.620 --> 19:23.896
- Oh, no!

19:26.413 --> 19:27.758
[metal pops]

19:27.827 --> 19:29.103
- On it.

19:31.482 --> 19:33.793
- You guys are hugging
the milk tank without me?

19:33.862 --> 19:35.172
No fair!

19:36.137 --> 19:37.551
- No, no, no. We need help.

19:37.620 --> 19:38.551
- What's the problem?

19:38.620 --> 19:40.137
- How do I explain this?

19:43.448 --> 19:45.172
- Whoa.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.758
- Hey, my blowgurt chemically
bonds with anything it touches.

19:47.827 --> 19:48.896
It can patch those leaks.

19:48.965 --> 19:50.689
- Great.
Unwrap us a few pieces.

19:50.758 --> 19:52.275
- I would, but, you know...

19:52.344 --> 19:54.310
[glass clinks]
Table hands.

19:55.586 --> 19:58.931
- Okay, Munchy, let's switch.
- Okay.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.758
All right.
One, two, three, switch!

20:07.034 --> 20:10.206
- So how's your day goin'?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.689
- My hands got turned
into tables, so you know,

20:12.758 --> 20:15.103
the yoozh.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.206
- Okay, do my foot first.
My leg is falling asleep.

20:18.275 --> 20:20.034
- Okay.
- Hey, it's working.

20:20.103 --> 20:21.931
- Quick!
It's so cold, it's hot!

20:23.793 --> 20:25.482
- That's scientifically
impossible.

20:25.551 --> 20:27.551
- Well, it's happening!

20:27.620 --> 20:29.689
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

20:29.758 --> 20:31.206
Okay.
- Hurry!

20:31.275 --> 20:32.206
- One more.

20:32.275 --> 20:34.586
- Ha! We're free!

20:34.655 --> 20:37.137
- Blowgurt, what can't it do?

20:38.551 --> 20:42.000
- Hey, why is that
red light still flashing?

20:43.586 --> 20:45.724
- That's why.

20:45.793 --> 20:47.655
- It's making bubbles.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.000
Beautiful blowgurt bubbles.

20:50.068 --> 20:52.413
Daddy's proud of you.

20:52.482 --> 20:54.655
- We've gotta find a way
to turn off the pressure.

20:54.724 --> 20:56.206
- Okay, I've got another idea.

20:56.275 --> 20:59.724
- No more ideas.
I'm looking at the manual.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.655
- Hey, why's it gotta be
a "man"-ual?

21:01.724 --> 21:03.586
Why not "woman"-ual?

21:03.655 --> 21:05.758
Or "girl"-ual?

21:05.827 --> 21:08.034
- Okay, there's a section about
dealing with kid baseball teams

21:08.103 --> 21:09.586
who always lose,
free sample moochers--

21:09.655 --> 21:11.275
[metal grinding]

21:11.344 --> 21:12.724
- Skip to the section
about the vat.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.517
These bubbles are
about to blow!

21:14.586 --> 21:16.862
[all screaming]

21:19.551 --> 21:23.000
Guys, we have to clean this up
before Ty gets here.

21:25.793 --> 21:28.000
- Whoa. What happened?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.931
- Ty, welcome back!

21:34.275 --> 21:37.689
We had a little trouble
with the milk tank.

21:37.758 --> 21:39.655
- But the good news is,

21:39.724 --> 21:43.103
there's no more milk left
in it, so the leaking stopped.

21:43.172 --> 21:46.482
- But don't you worry,
we're gonna clean it up.

21:46.551 --> 21:48.655
- Sounds good.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.965
You may not know this about me,

21:50.034 --> 21:52.413
but I don't really worry
about a lot of things.

21:52.482 --> 21:55.103
- He just gave me an opening.
Watch me work.

21:55.172 --> 21:57.310
So since you're chill
with all of this,

21:57.379 --> 21:59.068
does that mean we can
come back here and work again?

21:59.137 --> 22:01.000
- Oh, no. You're done.

22:01.068 --> 22:02.724
- And our paychecks will...

22:02.793 --> 22:04.034
- Be used for repairs.

22:04.103 --> 22:05.896
- Great, that's what I was
gonna suggest.
