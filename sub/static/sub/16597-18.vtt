00:03.604 --> 00:04.705
Hey, Dave.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.174
How's learning
your lines going?

00:06.207 --> 00:07.275
Lines are fine.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.178
What I have a problem with
is the glaring plot holes

00:10.211 --> 00:13.214
and character inconsistencies
of this wackadoodle story.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.417
Of Peter Pan?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.852
To fly, all you need
is fairy dust?

00:18.886 --> 00:21.322
Not thrust or lift?
Fairy dust.

00:23.324 --> 00:27.561
Ugh. I loathe
children's theater.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.463
Such a shallow
talent pool.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.466
Plus, Ms. Gibbons
always wildly miscasts
her productions.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.468
(SOFTLY) I mean, Dave playing
a boy who never grew up?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.070
We're out of Metamucil!

00:37.938 --> 00:39.107
(SNEEZES)

00:39.140 --> 00:40.741
ALLISON: Hey, Mol.
You feeling all right?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.176
Why are you rubbing
your neck?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.344
It kind of hurts.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.746
Do you have a headache?
A little.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.014
Are the lights
bothering you?

00:48.082 --> 00:49.283
Ken, please don't
do that thing

00:49.317 --> 00:51.018
where you assume
the worst-case scenario.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.287
I am quite confident
you have meningitis.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.190
I feel like
I teed that up.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.427
You have the classic
meningeal symptoms.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.762
Oh, my God. I can't go on
without children, Molly!

01:01.795 --> 01:04.465
Hello? I'm still here.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.034
Dad, settle.
I don't have meningitis.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.736
Then why are you sneezing?
Allergies.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.204
And the headache?
From the sneezing.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.573
Light sensitivity?
I just woke up from a nap.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.309
Neck pain?
My nap
was on the bad couch.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.445
Whew! Thank God
we caught it early.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.253
(GIGGLES)

01:25.286 --> 01:27.321
Oh. Get a load of this.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.057
They taught a chicken
to play tic-tac-toe.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.392
A chicken, Allison!

01:33.161 --> 01:34.762
What's wrong?

01:34.795 --> 01:37.298
After my shower, I did
a self-exam on my breasts,

01:37.331 --> 01:38.499
and I found a lump.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.735
A lump?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.571
Where?
W-W-When did you find it?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.239
Ken, I don't know.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.974
I just feel something
on my left side.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.012
Okay.
That's great you found it.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.715
Yeah, plus most of the time,
lumps are benign.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.550
It's like over 80%.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.085
But, Allison, you know
those numbers change

01:58.118 --> 01:59.953
when there's a family history
like yours.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.089
Like, your grandma,
your aunt.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.557
Ken, you're
stressing me out

02:03.591 --> 02:04.858
over something
that might be nothing.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.862
You're right.
I'll be right back.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.481

(DOOR OPENS)

02:35.689 --> 02:37.191
Okay, you're right.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.392
We don't know
anything yet.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.195
I'm not gonna spiral.
Here's what we're gonna do.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.864
We're gonna make
an appointment with
your doctor ASAP.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.599
I'll call first thing
in the morning.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.501
Everything's
gonna be fine.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.937
Until then, we're going to
distract ourselves

02:49.970 --> 02:52.506
by learning about
very smart farm animals.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.709
That sounds like
a great plan.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.877
Good.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.780
"His name was Charlie,

02:59.813 --> 03:02.683
"and he was the cleverest
chicken in the coop.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.586
"But Charlie
had bigger dreams..."

03:09.957 --> 03:11.859
Hey, Dad, can I use
your med-school books?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.727
A boy who never grows up.

03:13.761 --> 03:17.064
I need to understand how
that medically checks out.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.568
Isn't it amazing how this guy
throws himself into a role?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.270
That's why
he's always working.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.241
So, have you called
to make your appointment?

03:27.275 --> 03:30.511
Not yet. I'm going to as soon
as I get into the office.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.212
Want to just do it now?
The sooner, the better.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.047
Don't worry.
I-I'll call...

03:34.081 --> 03:37.017
as soon as I finish...
packing my bag for work.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.889
Can't forget this.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.663
Look, it's okay to be scared
to confront this, but...

03:49.697 --> 03:52.600
(INHALES SHARPLY)
...you have to
make the appointment, okay?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.302
I will.
Okay.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.669
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

03:55.703 --> 03:58.272
Oh, it's ringing.
See you at work.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.274
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Oh, wait. What...

04:00.308 --> 04:02.075
WOMAN: Hello.
Dr. Chamberlain's office.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.346
Oh, hi. This is, uh,
Allison Park, and I...

04:05.379 --> 04:06.714
Not quite sure
how to say this.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.550
Uh, I found a lump
in my breast and need
to make an appointment.

04:09.583 --> 04:14.221
WOMAN:
I see. Let me put you on hold
so I can pull up the calendar.

WOMAN:
Okay, when would you
like to come in?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.940
Uh, tomorrow
or the next day maybe.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.442
Let me see what we have.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.276
I'm just gonna place you
on a quick hold.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.145
Oh, wait, wait. I really
don't want to be put on...

04:38.178 --> 04:40.247
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS)

04:44.585 --> 04:47.988
Unfortunately, the doctor is
on vacation the next few days.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.123
(SIGHS) Come on.
Where could he be on vacation?

04:50.157 --> 04:51.459
Let me check for you.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.160
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
That was...

04:53.193 --> 04:54.395

He's learning to scuba dive.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.134
Cool, cool.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.371
Can you just give me the next
available appointment?

05:03.404 --> 05:07.040
Okay, you're set for two weeks
from tomorrow at 3:00.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.809
Great. Thank you.
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.949
Hey, Clark, could help audit
my dating-profile photos?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.618
You know,
since Megan and I split up,

05:17.651 --> 05:20.954
I've decided to, you know,
give telephone dating
a chance.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.158
These are great pictures
of you, Pat.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.694
I didn't know you knew
how to hang glide.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.161
I don't.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.597
But I know
how to Photoshop.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.401
You can't use
fake pictures, Pat.
Why not?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
I mean, if I use pictures
of a typical weekend,

05:35.068 --> 05:36.904
it would just be me
posting negative
Yelp reviews

05:36.937 --> 05:40.307
of restaurants who wouldn't
take a reservation for one.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.743
And I really want to do
all these things, so,
you know,

05:42.776 --> 05:45.513
I don't think of them
so much as lies,
as photos of my future.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.016
You want to have
a pet tiger?

05:49.049 --> 05:51.251
More than anything.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.855
I mean, why does dating
have to be so complicated
these days?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.391
Damona, you're lucky
you're currently entangled,

05:57.425 --> 05:58.626
if just to avoid
all this nonsense.

Yeah.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.974
You've been doing
such great work.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.143
I wanted to give you
a pineapple.

Thanks?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.852
I don't get a pineapple?

06:26.787 --> 06:28.321
Hey, did you make
that appointment?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.790
I did.
It's in two weeks.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.525
Two weeks?
That's too far out.

I mean, I come in early.
I stay late.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.029
But do I get a pineapple?
No.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.601
I know, but my doctor's
on a scuba-diving vacation
in Aruba,

06:40.634 --> 06:42.102
and I didn't know
what else to do.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.671
She knows I like fruit.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.740
You can see a different
doctor, Allison.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.142
Patients need to advocate for
themselves. Let me help you.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.446
You're right.
Thanks, Ken.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.882
Hey, I'm gonna make you
an earlier appointment

06:54.915 --> 06:57.117
even if it means
calling in fake shark attacks

06:57.150 --> 06:59.687
all over Aruba to smoke
your doctor out of there.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.529
Hey. Any luck
with the appointment?

07:08.562 --> 07:10.197
No.
It's like every surgeon's

either fully booked
or out of town.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.200
Mostly in Aruba, too.

mating season down there.

What's going on?

07:19.006 --> 07:21.041
Oh, it's nothing.
We're just talking about...

07:21.074 --> 07:22.910
Ken, it's okay.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.411
You sure?

07:25.345 --> 07:26.547
I want them to know.

wants you to know something!

out there, uh...

yesterday.

with this as you need.

it'll turn out
to be nothing.

know what was going on.

Why do we have to
come to Welltopia's
most humorless doctor?

Okay, yes, Dr. O'Sullivan
sucks as a person,

08:37.885 --> 08:39.920
a co-worker, and recycler,

08:40.621 --> 08:42.756
but he's a great doctor...

08:42.790 --> 08:44.692
and the only guy
we could get on short notice.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.762
I know.
And early detection is key.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.397
I just wish
he wasn't such a turd.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.399

08:52.432 --> 08:54.267
Gosh, why does this
have to be happening now?

08:54.301 --> 08:57.337
I've got so much going on.
I'm slammed at work.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.672
Dave's play
is in two days,

08:58.706 --> 09:00.407
and I still haven't made
the costume. Plus...

09:00.440 --> 09:02.442
Honey, honey,
everything's gonna get done.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.878
I'll take over all the play
stuff, including the costume.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.580
Thanks.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.882
Of course.
We're in this together.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.121
You know, it's, it's like
this sculpture over here.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.089
You know,
you press down
on one side,

09:16.123 --> 09:18.091
the other responds
and picks up the slack.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.293
Oh. That got...
That got away from me.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.561
Um...

09:24.264 --> 09:25.666
Sorry to
keep you waiting.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.967
Oh, no bigs.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.069
Just sitting here, waiting,
looking, not touching.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.141
Thanks again for seeing us.
We really appreciate it.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
So, what's the verdict?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.680
Unfortunately,
the ultrasound shows

09:39.713 --> 09:42.616
a solid mass highly suspicious
for malignancy,

09:42.650 --> 09:45.152
and full excision
is warranted.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.056
So there's a good chance

09:49.089 --> 09:51.659
this is cancer and we,
we have to remove it?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.493
I'm afraid so.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.398
Wow. This is
actually happening.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.601
So, we need to schedule
the procedure.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.203
W-When can you
put us on the books?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.605
And, FYI, there's been
tsunami warnings in Aruba,

10:05.639 --> 10:06.907
and if you think
for one second...

10:06.940 --> 10:10.610
I've already opened the spot,
tomorrow during my lunch break

10:10.644 --> 10:12.312
if that's okay with you,
Allison.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.149
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.485
Afterwards,
it'll take about 24 hours
to get the results back.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.387
(EXHALES HEAVILY)
Oh, man.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.789
Any chance
you could put me

10:21.822 --> 10:23.724
in a medically induced coma
until the results are in?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.325
(LAUGHS)

10:25.358 --> 10:26.359
No.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.930
That's not a safe
or reasonable request.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.400
I understand
the wait's tough.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.869
Try to distract yourself
with something you enjoy.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.739
Agreed. We have this whole
chicken tic-tac-toe situation

10:38.772 --> 10:40.373
that's pretty therapeutic.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.611
Thank you, Doctor.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.214
We'll see you tomorrow.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.353
Hey, there, Mol.
I'm making dinner.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.855
In the mood
for anything?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.925
Okay, Dad.
What's going on?

10:57.958 --> 11:01.561
Uh, men can make dinner,
Molly. It's 2015.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.833
It's 2017, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.036
I overheard Mom
on the phone.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.238
Does she have cancer?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
Um...

11:15.843 --> 11:17.410
We don't know yet,
sweetie,

11:17.444 --> 11:20.113
which is why we haven't
told you anything.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.583
She found a suspicious lump,
and today we had it removed.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.987
We get the biopsy results
tomorrow, but until then...

11:27.020 --> 11:28.221
Until then,
we don't know.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.190
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.293
Dad...

11:34.261 --> 11:35.996
(SNIFFLES)
I'm scared.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.732
It's okay.
I-I'm scared, too.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.401
And just, just know
that it's okay

11:41.434 --> 11:44.805
to process these fears
however you want.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.107
Would you like to rip some
hand towels in half, sweetie?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.342
No.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.778
Okay, no judgment.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.913
(SNIFFLES)

11:53.781 --> 11:55.448
Look, the best thing
for us to do

11:55.482 --> 11:58.385
is to be strong and
help her rest and relax.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.289
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.858
Actually,
could you drive Dave
to his play tonight?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.726
I mean, I already
finished his costume,

12:06.760 --> 12:08.762
but I'm not sure Mom
will have the energy to go.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.563
You got it.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.533
Hey. Hey.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.068
It'll be okay.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.037
(SNIFFLES)

12:21.374 --> 12:23.944
Hey, uh, has anyone heard
anything about Allison's
biopsy?

12:23.977 --> 12:27.147
Yeah, Ken said it went fine.
They're just waiting to hear.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.581
Man, this sucks.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.919
Uh, stuff like this
reminds you how short
life is.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.586
Totally.
And yet we never
get around

12:33.620 --> 12:36.389
to doing the things we really
want to, like traveling.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.259
Or I keep saying that
I'm-a learn how to play tennis

12:39.292 --> 12:41.094
so I can play with my dad,
but I never do it.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.629
Uh, that's it.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.265
This weekend, I'm taking
hang-gliding lessons.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.168
Bam!
Way to go, Pat!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.737
Yep. Caution and me,
to the wind.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.111
Hey, Allison.
I made you meatloaf.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.680
And if that's too heavy,
I also made spaghetti,

13:00.713 --> 13:02.349
Cobb salad, and even sushi,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.551
but it's basically rice
and cucumber just balled up.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.320
What are you looking at?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
I've spent
the last four hours

13:09.022 --> 13:12.559
googling all things related
to breast cancer, tumors,

13:12.592 --> 13:14.294
and, in an odd
rabbit-hole detour,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.963
how to escape
if you've been kidnapped

13:15.996 --> 13:17.464
but still have
your shoelaces.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.534
O-kay, you're spiraling.
I'm just gonna take this.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.003
I'm learning
about zip ties!

13:24.271 --> 13:26.273
Allison, why are you filling
your head with that stuff?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.540
You should be resting.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.976
(SIGHS) I know.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.477
But my mind
is just racing.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.146
Why does it take so long
to find out the results?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.449
What if I do get sick?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.818
Then you have to
take care of the kids.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.454
No. Allison,
don't go there.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.523
Promise me you're not
thinking about that, okay?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.425
But I am thinking
about it.
No.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.526
(SIGHS)

13:46.559 --> 13:48.195
I even started
typing out instructions

13:48.228 --> 13:51.231
on where everything is
in the house

13:51.264 --> 13:52.599
and how to raise
the children.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.902
No, uh, stop. Allison,
I don't, I can't hear...

13:54.935 --> 13:56.369
No, Ken,
I-I need to say this.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.071
I started typing,
but I stopped

13:58.105 --> 14:00.773
because I realized
you don't need it.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.612
You've been so strong
through all this

14:05.645 --> 14:08.415
that, that I know
regardless of what happens,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.750
you and the kids
will be fine.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.052
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

14:12.085 --> 14:14.988
(CRYING) Thank you for
making this all about me.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.794
(SIGHS)
So, let's get you some food.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.297
(SIGHS)

14:28.635 --> 14:30.737
What's in the meatloaf?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.305
Grapes. Is that wrong?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.941
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:36.776 --> 14:38.912
This wait is just
driving me crazy.

14:40.747 --> 14:44.651
Well, Dave's play starts in
an hour if you're up for it.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.055
Though, children's theater
isn't much better

14:48.088 --> 14:49.722
than waiting to find out
if you have cancer.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.458
Ken!
(LAUGHS)

14:51.491 --> 14:53.060
Come on.
You know I'm right.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.761
Half the kids
are mumbling their lines.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.530
The other half...
(ROBOTICALLY) ...are saying
their lines like this!

14:57.564 --> 14:59.399
(BOTH LAUGHING)

14:59.432 --> 15:01.868
It's like, "Hey, kids,
ever heard of nuance?"

15:01.901 --> 15:03.770
(DRAMATICALLY)
No, they have not.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.207
Let's go to the play.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.876
I don't want
to miss anything.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.813
Um, you want me to pack up
some of this food for you?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.248
Um...

15:17.985 --> 15:19.852
Maybe we'll just grab
something on the way.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.356
I love you.
I love you.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.298
(PIANO PLAYING)

15:31.331 --> 15:33.366
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

15:38.071 --> 15:39.139
(SOFTLY) Hey.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.774
(GASPS) What are
you guys doing here?

15:41.808 --> 15:43.110
Molly wasn't sure
you'd feel up to it,

15:43.143 --> 15:45.045
and she wanted to
make sure that Dave
had some people here.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.747
Wow.
That's so sweet.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.349
Well, speak for yourself.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.584
I was drawn in by a blurb
in the Calabasas Trumpet.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.086
(LAUGHTER)

15:54.721 --> 15:56.189
So far,
the Lost Boys were...

15:56.223 --> 15:58.025
Oh, we, we know
the story, sweetie.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.759
Not this version.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.561
Dave has made some
interesting choices.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.236
Nice job
on the costume.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.338
I said I'd make it.
I didn't say it would fit.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.773
Also, I broke
the sewing machine.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.145
They say I'm a boy
who never grows up.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.313
But I have announcement.
That's a lie!

16:22.049 --> 16:25.085
I'm actually
a 22-year-old man with
hypo-plastic kidneys...

16:26.686 --> 16:29.289
...a disorder which
can result in small stature.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.292
Now that that's
fully explained...

16:33.060 --> 16:34.594
hit it, Barb.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.163
(PIANO PLAYING)

16:41.968 --> 16:43.203
* Ooh
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

16:43.236 --> 16:45.538
If I stay a boy,
I'll be safe.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.874
I'll hide away
in a magical place.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.142
* Ooh

16:49.176 --> 16:51.711
But even here
in Neverland,

16:51.744 --> 16:53.746
danger is always
close at hand.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.116
So you must be strong

16:56.149 --> 16:57.917
or at least try...

16:57.950 --> 17:02.055
* To believe
that you can fly *

17:27.147 --> 17:29.082
(SQUEAKING)
Aah!

17:29.916 --> 17:31.118
Uh-oh.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.188
Whoa!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

17:36.256 --> 17:37.257

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

17:53.740 --> 17:56.943
This is what happens
when you only use
fairy dust to fly.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.112
I need thrust, people!

17:59.146 --> 18:00.547
(LAUGHTER)

18:00.580 --> 18:01.614
Whoo!

18:01.648 --> 18:03.483
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:09.156 --> 18:10.923
I'm so glad we came.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.438
Did you see that news
about Russia?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.807
No. What?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.142
I don't know.
I just saw a headline.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.277
I was hoping you could
explain it to me.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.249
Okay.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.419
The results are in.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.321
The good news is...

18:41.354 --> 18:42.455
you don't have cancer.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.123
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

18:47.093 --> 18:48.094
(SNIFFLES)

18:52.565 --> 18:53.666
Um...

18:55.235 --> 18:56.903
Okay, so,
what's the bad news?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.305
There isn't any.
Why would you ask that?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.210
This is such a relief.
So, what was the lump?

19:03.243 --> 19:07.079
It was an LCIS,
or Lobular Carcinoma
In Situ.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.683
It's an area of abnormal
cell growth that
isn't cancer itself

19:10.717 --> 19:13.353
but can increase the risk
of cancer later in life.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.487
But we removed all of it,

19:14.521 --> 19:15.922
and you don't need
any further treatment.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.424
(SIGHS)

19:17.457 --> 19:20.393
Just keep a close eye on it,
and get your annual
mammograms.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.495
I will.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.732
Thank you so much, Doctor.
You've been amazing.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.301
I couldn't have gotten
through it without you.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.070
Yes, thank you so much,
Dr. O'Sullivan.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.839
You really weren't
our first choice,

19:32.872 --> 19:35.808
but you surprised us with how
kind and wonderful you were!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.344
Excuse me?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.746
He just means
"Thank you."
Come on, Ken.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.081
Oh, you put that
back together.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.483
No, no, no.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.622
What the...
(GASPS)

19:49.656 --> 19:52.091
Oh, my God!

19:52.124 --> 19:53.526
Oh, my God!

19:54.461 --> 19:57.497
Pat!
Oh, Pat! Thank you!

19:57.530 --> 20:00.233
This really means a lot!

20:00.267 --> 20:02.001
Uh, this week
just reminded me

20:02.034 --> 20:05.204
that life's too short to
not go after what you want.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.639
This is just...
Thank you, Pat.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.674
I really a...

20:11.411 --> 20:13.413
Pat, God!

20:13.446 --> 20:15.315
You had to go and mess
everything up.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.717
I'm sorry.
I just thought...

20:17.750 --> 20:18.851
Uh-mm.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.024
Well, Dennis
at the school paper

20:25.057 --> 20:27.727
sure is dragging his heels
on reviewing my play.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.562
What's he waiting for?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.664
Don't worry.
You were great, sweetie.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.366
Yeah, you definitely
stole the show.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.569
You don't have to tell me.
I saw you guys from the stage.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.338
You were laughing,
you were crying.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.606
I'm a star!

20:41.841 --> 20:43.843
I, I'm fine.
It's not...
Well?

20:43.876 --> 20:44.944
Ohh.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.918
I feel like I'm missing
some key information,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.720
but I'm gonna get in
on this, too.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.594
Hi. This is my
real-life wife, Tran.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.297
I know firsthand that
screenings can save a life.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.965
Stand Up To Cancer

21:05.998 --> 21:09.101
