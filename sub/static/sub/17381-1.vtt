00:24.560 --> 00:30.522
INSIDE THE WHORE

02:44.680 --> 02:47.160
My God...

02:58.920 --> 03:01.002
Wow!

03:02.640 --> 03:04.847
Welcome!

03:09.200 --> 03:12.647
My name is John Smith.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.839
I'm from "Another
World Entertainment".

03:18.840 --> 03:24.079
A couple of weeks ago we received
a film and a note in the mail.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.679
It happens all the time, but...

03:26.680 --> 03:30.366
this is not an ordinary note.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.966
I'll read the note.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.971
If you manage to get this film
approved by the film board...

03:40.200 --> 03:44.888
you will be allowed to release it.
This is my second film...

03:45.280 --> 03:48.966
and clearly my
greatest masterpiece.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.962
I'll be proud if you
accept "inside the Whore".

04:01.360 --> 04:07.163
All profits will go to you as
thanks for your collaboration.

04:07.480 --> 04:11.280
But only if you also
release part 2.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.325
In it's full length.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.289
That note did not just
come from anybody.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.479
That note didn't come from some
student at the Norwegian Film School.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.280
It came from someone with a vision.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.844
A man with a vision!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.970
Hallelujah!

04:39.560 --> 04:43.121
- Oh...
- Yes?

04:44.400 --> 04:49.919
Excuse me, my name is Hans,
from the Norwegian Media Authority.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.211
This is my wife Dagrun, from the
feminist organisation Rottar.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.611
This is my friend and colleague
Mikkel, from the media authority.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.730
You asked for distribution
of "The Whore"...

05:06.160 --> 05:09.319
for the sole purpose
of making money.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.881
We are very proud of
"The Whore" as a product.

05:13.360 --> 05:19.599
And I am very thankful that you are
here, so you can give your rating...

05:19.600 --> 05:23.366
to our last product
"inside the Whore!"

05:23.840 --> 05:27.999
We have come to see the
product and form an opinion.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.287
This is a product,
you say so yourself.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.119
It's not a film. It's about
violence and nudity.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.839
It's the same trash as part 1.

05:37.840 --> 05:44.007
It could have been made by a bunch of
horny high school students up north.

05:44.760 --> 05:49.971
With that statement, you
discard not only this film...

05:50.360 --> 05:56.811
but the director and, above all,
every future Norwegian director.

05:57.640 --> 06:04.046
My colleague is saying that the
film does not deserve distribution.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.041
The film has fans all over the world.
It's an international phenomenon.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.839
There's a bunch of people out
there with weird fetishes...

06:13.840 --> 06:17.879
who have no idea whatsoever
what quality film is.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.488
The first film made people puke...

06:23.880 --> 06:28.522
and pass out in the theatre.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.403
It shocked the Norwegian press...

06:32.600 --> 06:38.403
so much that they slaughtered the
film like a lamb at the altar.

06:39.480 --> 06:44.281
At the altar of ignorance!

06:44.520 --> 06:47.330
And arrogance!

06:51.000 --> 06:55.050
And despite the absence of
support in his own country...

06:55.200 --> 06:58.879
this person has carried
out his new vision...

06:58.880 --> 07:02.851
in a style which he himself
calls "meta action".

07:03.000 --> 07:06.766
The man with the
vision: Reinert Kiil!

07:07.360 --> 07:13.447
And his new vision is
"inside The Whore"!

07:16.760 --> 07:20.242
Or The Whore 2, as some
people like to call it.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.679
When does the cultural news start?

07:28.680 --> 07:31.639
- Around 22.30.
- Then we won't make it.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.440
Oh yes, this is probably the
same crap as last time.

07:35.600 --> 07:41.323
We'll watch a bit, approve it,
then e-mail saying to air this shit.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.122
- I'm hungry.
- Let's buy sushi on our way home.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.089
- Yes.
- Baby...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.759
Not here. Please, I have
told you a hundred times.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.359
Not among people.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.199
But you know your tight
pants make me so horny.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.599
Then show it in
different way, please.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.199
- What will people think?
- What kind of people?

08:07.200 --> 08:10.439
People around us. They
are looking at us.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.570
Baby, honey... Honey...

08:15.360 --> 08:17.681
You know I love you.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.079
- I love you, too, but...
- Shhh! It's starting!

08:21.080 --> 08:23.003
Don't you "shhh" me!

08:25.320 --> 08:28.449
You male chauvinist pig.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.246
Finding a new one now.
The film is starting.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.727
Stop here!

08:55.560 --> 08:58.609
- On a trip?
- Who are you?

08:59.880 --> 09:03.965
I sell flowers here. It started as a
little mole and spread to the body.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.279
Doc says I can't get
more chemotherapy.

09:12.280 --> 09:17.279
- It's not the shit in your mouth?
- Snuff makes me horny.

09:17.280 --> 09:22.320
A year ago I got cancer. Look.
I have only three months to live.

09:28.280 --> 09:34.159
This morning I vomited blood. I used
to cough blood, today I vomited.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.367
Damn how you cough blood.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.121
- What's your name?
- Marthine.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.250
- How old are you, Marthine?
- I'm 19.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.399
- What are you doing here?
- It's an audition, I think.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.971
Audition for what?

09:53.120 --> 09:55.441
- An audition for what?
- A film.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.289
- You know there's nudity in the film?
- Yeah, I heard about it.

10:04.560 --> 10:10.203
- What do you think about nudity?
- No nudity in front of a camera.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.726
- How far are you willing to go?
- Underwear.

10:17.680 --> 10:23.289
- Can I see you fucked hard?
- Yes. But why is there a camera here?

10:24.400 --> 10:26.846
For the record, so I
can watch it later.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.604
- But nobody will watch this?
- Nobody but me.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.247
- Can you stand up?
- Yes.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.007
Turn around.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.564
Sit down.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.167
I'm going to ask you
to show your tits.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.242
- To get the part?
- Yes.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.565
- Can I see your tits now?
- Nobody else will see this?

11:24.920 --> 11:27.287
No, I promise.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.522
So... Are you filming?

11:45.200 --> 11:48.124
We just have to do this now.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.729
We...

11:52.280 --> 11:54.559
- Did you change the tape?
- Oh, fuck!

11:54.560 --> 11:58.360
Promise me that no
matter what happens...

11:59.320 --> 12:03.723
while we are shooting,
that you won't stop filming.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.567
You must promise me that.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.524
- What's your role?
- Production and personal assistant.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.887
- Are my tits going to be on film.
- You should take the role to the max.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.761
- Is that what you're saying?
- It's in the script, you did read it?

12:32.000 --> 12:38.359
I have read the script. There was
nothing about me being naked.

12:38.360 --> 12:43.844
Since you're famous from "Fritt Vilt"
and Max Anus, you can get it all?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.767
My dear, little boy!

12:49.080 --> 12:55.281
Do you think I'm going to take my
clothes off in a low budget movie?

12:55.920 --> 13:02.087
Which all of a sudden has no
script, no fucking plot or story!

13:02.320 --> 13:06.291
Jeanette's process has
completely disappeared!

13:07.000 --> 13:12.803
And on top of that, a crap director!
A fucker! I've met many assholes...

13:13.480 --> 13:17.565
but none of them as dark as yours!

13:18.240 --> 13:23.280
Do you hear me! I don't
understand why I even bother.

13:23.920 --> 13:28.960
You are worthless. You're not
even worth my anger. I just...

13:30.080 --> 13:35.166
Poor bastards who have to
work with this shit! Oh!

13:37.160 --> 13:39.128
Fuck!

13:56.640 --> 13:58.642
Hi.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.451
Hi.

14:33.520 --> 14:39.801
I've always dreamt about making a
film which is as real as possible.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.327
And...

14:45.280 --> 14:49.968
Part 1 was crude,
but it was fictional.

14:50.280 --> 14:55.320
So what could then be better than
putting reality into the fiction.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.609
We'll be shooting the first scene.

15:00.920 --> 15:06.404
Between Robot Geisha versus...

15:06.600 --> 15:08.602
Can we do that again?

15:10.000 --> 15:13.288
Now we'll start filming...

15:13.720 --> 15:18.521
the first encounter
between Geisha and...

15:18.720 --> 15:24.409
Shooting. The first
day between Robot...

15:24.680 --> 15:28.366
Robot Geisha versus
Tanya out in a field.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.761
OK... We'll start pretty soon.

15:34.360 --> 15:39.279
They'll run towards each
other, and there will be...

15:39.280 --> 15:44.207
fighting, weapons, blood...

15:45.240 --> 15:49.802
It's a battle of life or death.
That's what we'll start with.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.639
This is good. Isn't it?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.679
We like this.

15:59.680 --> 16:03.002
Yes... That's cool.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.170
Torgrim, are you finished packing?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.571
- Stop.
- Thank you.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.126
Can I see it? Can I see it?

16:51.720 --> 16:55.486
I'm the assistant director.

16:55.680 --> 17:01.562
We're delayed, but we're going
to shoot the first scene.

17:02.040 --> 17:06.364
Anna Lee d'Oratzio, as I said,
the assistant director-

17:06.640 --> 17:09.086
-making sure everything works.

17:09.720 --> 17:15.840
So far we haven't really started.
I'll make sure things happen on time.

17:16.079 --> 17:21.040
Reinert to Anna Lee:
Are we leaving soon?

17:21.920 --> 17:26.448
Eh... Soon, soon, soon.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.010
I have to go, sorry... OK, people!

17:41.200 --> 17:44.319
What do you think?
Will you get a film out of this?

17:44.320 --> 17:46.243
We'll make the hottest movie.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.725
What do you think of
the girls? Top notch?

17:53.120 --> 17:58.206
Don't you think? We've
stuck to the plan so far.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.491
I believe this will be the
movie of the century.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.207
Yes.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.966
Tonight we'll get them dead drunk.

18:21.160 --> 18:25.210
- Can I ask you a question?
- Fornication?

18:25.880 --> 18:29.566
Look at him!

18:42.320 --> 18:47.611
- Have a little drink. Have a drink!
- No!

18:49.200 --> 18:51.646
No.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.483
Look here.

18:57.040 --> 19:02.524
Why did you decide to make
the sequel to The Whore?

19:02.840 --> 19:07.607
I'll tell you... There
are two reasons.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.681
One: to please the fans.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.722
Second: to fuck the media authority,
who has ruined everything.

19:19.080 --> 19:25.122
So when you're on that movie vibe,
why don't you rather make...

19:25.520 --> 19:29.605
a porn film. It pays much better.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.130
I told you hundreds of times. I'll
never be a part of that business.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.568
Why not?

19:43.080 --> 19:47.319
Vidar, won't you come in
and fist her tight ass?

19:47.320 --> 19:50.130
Is there room for another one?

19:50.280 --> 19:54.479
- OK. Bye!
- Bye-bye!

19:54.480 --> 19:57.609
No, no, fuck! Pussy,
for fuck's sake.

20:11.040 --> 20:15.329
People will do anything
to become famous.

20:16.160 --> 20:22.042
These fucking fools think they only
have to take their clothes off...

20:22.280 --> 20:26.365
that they'll be famous and get
an acting career by undressing.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.326
It's sheer exploitation.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.170
It's sheer exploitation,
god damn it!

20:48.200 --> 20:50.726
Good night!

21:20.040 --> 21:25.843
I don't really feel anything for
the girls that were in the film.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.327
What's done, is done.

21:55.600 --> 22:01.960
I made contact with them
through different web sites...

22:02.360 --> 22:07.241
and met some of them
out on the street.

22:07.520 --> 22:12.082
Most importantly, it was
about how they looked.

22:12.640 --> 22:18.522
I wanted the girls to be gorgeous,
so we could sell the film.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.371
Reinert?

22:29.920 --> 22:32.879
- Lisa.
- Hi.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.442
- What are you working on?
- The shooting schedule.

22:37.720 --> 22:41.645
You know, the times...

22:42.560 --> 22:46.326
- You weren't at the party yesterday?
- No.

22:48.120 --> 22:53.843
- Why not?
- Somebody has to keep track of this.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.651
- This is a mess.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.966
- Hi, girl.
- Hi.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.050
We must start getting ready.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.691
Hey... Are you OK?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.803
Thank you!

24:01.000 --> 24:04.839
Cut. Cut!

24:04.840 --> 24:06.842
Cut!

24:07.120 --> 24:10.966
Thank you. That was very good.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.843
But... I think we'll do another.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.241
Let's do another take immediately.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.723
Cancel. If there's no electricity,
it'll be too expensive.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.045
Alright, thank you. Bye.

24:49.480 --> 24:55.169
- What happened?
- We lost our location.

24:55.360 --> 25:01.481
We'll just have to
find another location.

25:02.360 --> 25:08.083
But we can deal with that tomorrow.
Let's just shoot this scene today.

25:09.280 --> 25:13.683
People are getting tired.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.842
Isn't that why we're here?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.448
That's very good.

25:31.680 --> 25:35.844
- Are you sure?
- Yes, very good.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.207
But let's do another one.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.366
I don't know what's worse: mosquito
bites or losing our location.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.200
- What do you think?
- Mosquito bites feel worse.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.724
- Thank you!
- Cut!

26:24.920 --> 26:28.447
- Cut!
- That was very good.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.363
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.846
It's so dark, this is just shit.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.404
- Stay here and talk to Susanne.
- Fuck, this is killing me.

26:54.520 --> 27:00.519
We're up late, it's all shit:
crap food, crap beds...

27:00.520 --> 27:07.005
People are pissed off. There's no
catering or beds, as promised.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.564
To sleep in. We were to get a big,
fat cock, but we didn't get much.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.129
- Very good. You'll have one.
- Anniken. I'll have yours.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.642
- I just tried to... Ah!
- Go to bed!

27:27.600 --> 27:32.083
Shut up and do your job, for once.

27:33.680 --> 27:39.839
- Boring... Not me, you!
- I'm stuck. I thought we were to work.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.846
We've discussed this. Shut up and
don't talk like that to an actress.

27:45.440 --> 27:49.411
- Really? Fuck you.
- You must have a dildo up your ass.

27:51.240 --> 27:57.282
What about you? Drooling all over
the actors? Is that very professional?

27:59.080 --> 28:03.085
Get her out of this party.
She's ruining everything.

28:03.880 --> 28:08.079
I wanted to push everyone down in the
dirt to get the best out of them.

28:08.080 --> 28:14.359
And she talks to them like buddies
after two days. That pisses me off.

28:14.360 --> 28:19.400
Still does, thinking
about that damn cunt...

28:23.880 --> 28:28.010
Cool... I really fucked her up.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.965
She locked herself in the toilet.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.199
Cheers, man.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.359
I just got to take a leak.

28:45.360 --> 28:50.161
Let's put the jib on some tracks.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.326
Yeah, rock 'n' roll man.

29:07.680 --> 29:12.971
I feel pretty cool now.
Ready to go out.

29:13.120 --> 29:18.239
- Tell us about your character.
- About the character I'm playing?

29:18.240 --> 29:23.963
- A kind of a robot, cyborg, or what?
- Yeah, cyborg.

29:25.480 --> 29:30.122
Part human, part robot.

29:30.720 --> 29:36.568
I have a fight scene with Tanya.

29:36.760 --> 29:41.891
She's the main character
of the film. That's cool.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.968
Little innocent mouse
scuttling about.

29:47.400 --> 29:53.442
Curious about the world and
unaware of the dangers.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.801
Yes, put it here.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.324
Can you help me
tighten this, please?

30:17.720 --> 30:21.805
Think "lousy robot
from the sixties".

30:23.640 --> 30:25.847
Yeah, that's rather like it.

30:26.040 --> 30:30.648
And look straight forward.
Will that be OK for the camera?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.249
So...

30:35.200 --> 30:39.205
You can also use that eye effect.
It will be bright around your eyes.

30:46.400 --> 30:52.601
- Why are you in "inside the Whore"?
- Listen to the name. It's exciting.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.759
When you have seen part 1,
you really want to be in part 2.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.888
A two-pack.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.960
That's more than three. How many?

31:04.200 --> 31:07.090
- It's an orgy.
- Yes, it is.

31:09.160 --> 31:14.963
- I didn't know that you were a slut.
- I'm not so sweet and innocent.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.766
There is a devil in me, too.

31:21.400 --> 31:25.450
Are you willing to take
it in your number two?

31:27.520 --> 31:31.764
How about number two? Do you usually
take it in your number two?

31:32.120 --> 31:36.648
Eh... What do you mean by that?

31:38.440 --> 31:41.967
Not as many as you think.

31:42.560 --> 31:46.201
- I don't think anything.
- Yes, you do.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.965
Aurora, what kind of girl are you?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.890
I can be anything, if I want to.

31:57.400 --> 32:02.281
- Are you easy?
- You mean as a character?

32:03.240 --> 32:09.407
Rape? I have a different perspective.
There's so much talk about it.

32:10.800 --> 32:15.567
But... It's not as bad as they say.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.805
It's just a movie.
It's acting. That's it.

32:20.720 --> 32:26.284
- So you're an easy girl?
- No. I don't think so.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.368
I don't think I'm easy.

32:32.080 --> 32:38.725
Stupid, naked, young, blond pussies.
That's the kind of actors we need.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.040
- It's just fine.
- I'm tired of waiting.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.809
Are you?

32:51.240 --> 32:57.486
It's OK. The weather is nice.
The cock is rock hard.

32:58.520 --> 33:03.287
- Hey, calm down. Calm down.
- This is enough.

33:30.360 --> 33:35.844
Where's the focus?
Do I just turn this...

33:38.160 --> 33:43.963
This is all turning ever
more unprofessional.

33:47.680 --> 33:51.879
People are more interested
in getting drunk than...

33:51.880 --> 33:56.079
You drink, and complain
about people drinking.

33:56.080 --> 33:59.607
- I did not start the party.
- You're just as drunk as anybody.

34:04.320 --> 34:09.201
- Hi.
- Hi. My name is Silje.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.965
I'm doing the make
up in The Whore 2.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.808
And...

34:18.320 --> 34:21.319
I did the make up in The Whore 1.

34:21.320 --> 34:25.688
The guys I work with, are
serious and professional.

34:26.880 --> 34:31.966
All I have learned is...
what I have learned from them.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.360
Are you filming?

34:40.920 --> 34:43.002
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:45.120 --> 34:49.569
Please! Go away!
Have you eaten today?

34:54.679 --> 34:58.366
Thank you! Pull yourself together!

35:04.800 --> 35:06.962
Action!

35:07.360 --> 35:11.285
Scene 42, take 20. Action!

35:32.440 --> 35:34.886
- Thank you!
- Cut!

35:43.200 --> 35:48.604
Reinert has been strange for a while.
He's getting a little freaky.

35:49.240 --> 35:55.361
And Iselin has gone completely...
She's practically out of reach.

35:57.080 --> 36:03.167
I think she... I think she's
in trouble. She's struggling.

36:08.280 --> 36:13.207
There's something in your face.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.250
I think they're going crazy...

36:30.720 --> 36:35.203
Well, nudity: it's not
really a problem for me.

36:35.880 --> 36:39.566
I've no problems with my body.

36:40.320 --> 36:44.530
What kind of preparations
have you done for this part?

36:45.160 --> 36:49.802
You have to dip into the character.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.399
Satan!

37:31.400 --> 37:36.239
I guess that when everybody enter in
the scene, and Marina the producer...

37:36.240 --> 37:38.527
It is...

37:40.000 --> 37:45.769
When he did this thing and went up to
her, nobody tells him what goes on...

37:48.160 --> 37:53.291
- It made everything more crazy.
- It's like: "Do something!"

37:54.320 --> 37:58.609
- It comes straight from the heart.
- This girl is perfect.

38:05.160 --> 38:10.719
- Nobody can di it like her.
- I know already there will be blood.

38:10.720 --> 38:14.042
And maggots. But I did not
know it would be like this.

38:14.400 --> 38:20.399
It was so hard. There is no way I
thought it would be like this.

38:20.400 --> 38:26.567
Go and help Iselin. Get her
hair away from her pussy!

38:52.000 --> 38:55.527
- Is it ok?
- Yes.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.047
Why did I take ten sips, then?

39:04.000 --> 39:07.559
I'll save your number if I get
hungry for loser-cock, Torgrim.

39:07.560 --> 39:11.007
- Go and kiss her! Do you dare to?
- Do it yourself!

39:12.000 --> 39:15.559
- You're really disgusting.
- I know. I love myself.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.799
- Do you?
- Yes.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.962
Good for you somebody does.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.765
Do you remember? Uno, uno!

39:26.000 --> 39:27.968
"Membrandt! Membrandt!"

39:29.000 --> 39:33.050
"Puta! Puta!" I'm from Portugal.

39:35.800 --> 39:40.362
Vidar! Never mind that
ugly woman. Look at this!

39:44.200 --> 39:47.568
Oh-la-la...

39:47.880 --> 39:54.729
Look. She's coming onto me. I can be
your boyfriend and lick your pussy.

40:02.360 --> 40:07.605
Lisa, production manager. Show some
respect and hand me the booze!

40:13.080 --> 40:16.448
Yes, that's good.
Shake it, shake it!

40:16.640 --> 40:20.690
The production manager,
too, is showing off.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.479
Fucking west side cunt!

40:25.480 --> 40:30.088
- She's angry.
- This is what filmmaking is about.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.843
We have to get rid of that bitch...

40:40.240 --> 40:45.679
- He's just acting...
- He's completely in his own world.

40:45.680 --> 40:50.481
And he has these bursts of
laughter. It's not normal.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.842
Should I - should I do it?

41:10.160 --> 41:14.643
- I've listened to you for so long.
- I've found some really good people.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.362
Should I do it?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.604
Thanks!

41:28.600 --> 41:32.279
Jesus, it's too fucking
dark, god damn it.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.851
We'll do another right away!

41:35.000 --> 41:39.881
First and foremost I thought the
director said I'd stay in a hotel.

41:40.280 --> 41:45.199
I ended up in a school, I think.

41:45.200 --> 41:50.479
It was if I was prisoned
with one actress, you know.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.485
I couldn't go to the other house,
because all the foodwas there.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.368
He says one thing, the next
day it'll be different.

41:58.840 --> 42:03.289
What shall we do tomorrow, today?
"I don't know." What?

42:03.520 --> 42:08.481
You don't know. It's crazy.
I just have to go with the flow.

42:08.720 --> 42:13.123
Maybe there is some miscommunication,
because this guy...

42:14.160 --> 42:19.039
I think he has a different accent.
He comes from the north.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.840
- ...North, north, Finnmark.
- Irris! Irris!

42:23.720 --> 42:27.639
<i>You little cunt
You little cunt</i>

42:27.640 --> 42:32.123
<i>I'm going to fuck you to the east</i>

42:32.280 --> 42:35.807
<i>And fuck you to the west</i>

42:43.240 --> 42:46.961
We must get Irris to
take off the top.

42:48.320 --> 42:53.639
- You have to take off your top.
- Take off my top?!

42:53.640 --> 42:59.639
Yes, you have to take it off,
show a little skin. No big deal.

42:59.640 --> 43:04.999
We said so. You take that off, so
we see your tits, but not in frame.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.399
Tits? I can understand a
little Norwegian. Show tits?

43:09.400 --> 43:13.999
- He is just kidding.
- No, I cannot do that.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.399
- Makeup is ready!
- I'm freaking out and you just smile!

43:18.400 --> 43:22.479
- Please show some care!
- He's smiling with you.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.209
He enjoys this!

43:24.360 --> 43:26.442
- Susanna?
- Yes.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.766
- Show us some skin, will you?
- No.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.244
- I'd rather not.
- Come on!

43:36.000 --> 43:38.765
Skin? Here's a lot of skin.

43:40.240 --> 43:43.687
No. I don't want to do that.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.604
When I woke up that morning,
I knew what had happened.

44:00.080 --> 44:05.007
What's wrong with this guy?
He looks completely crazy.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.522
Oh, are you taping this?

44:13.280 --> 44:15.519
What's up?

44:15.520 --> 44:17.887
- You're needed on the set.
- Yes.

44:26.120 --> 44:30.999
Have you seen Reinert?
Do you know who did it?

44:31.000 --> 44:35.244
Do you know who did it?

44:56.400 --> 44:58.079
What the fuck?

44:58.080 --> 45:02.290
Nobody has a phone? OK.
So nobody here has a phone.

45:06.680 --> 45:09.763
What the fuck happened here?

45:23.040 --> 45:25.964
Fuck, this is a mess.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.810
- And who's made this mess?
- Ask yourself!

45:32.920 --> 45:35.571
- Has this been printed today?
- Yes.

45:40.120 --> 45:42.771
Can I see your fantastic dick?

45:43.560 --> 45:49.203
I've been awake all night touching
myself dreaming about penetration.

45:49.600 --> 45:53.359
I don't show my diamond
to mere mortals.

45:53.360 --> 45:57.679
- Be kind, my God.
- Don't speak to me, pitiful human.

45:57.680 --> 46:01.002
- I haven't had a cock for too long.
- Wanna look?

46:01.240 --> 46:05.802
- Are you worthy of my cock?
- I can't take any more.

46:06.200 --> 46:12.082
I want to feel a little, taste
a little. Maybe jerk you off?

46:12.400 --> 46:15.529
What if I go down on
all fours like a dog?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.241
That is not helping.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.127
Vidar, please go upstairs
and get the camera ready.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.849
- I do everything for a drop of sperm!
- Weak person!

46:32.720 --> 46:35.246
Is the snow ready up there?

46:35.800 --> 46:39.725
- Is the snow ready?
- It has arrived. It's on its way.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.519
She's doing make-up,
but we're about to start.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.603
Silje! How is everything?

46:47.120 --> 46:50.879
- At the camera down there.
- Look at the camera!

46:50.880 --> 46:53.724
I am looking!

46:58.760 --> 47:01.127
Vidar! Go to the camera!

47:01.480 --> 47:03.448
Vidar!

47:05.240 --> 47:11.486
- There isn't much to do about it.
- Dragging actors out in the woods...

47:11.800 --> 47:20.129
- Shhh! They are shooting now! Quiet!
- This is such shit!

47:22.600 --> 47:25.365
There's partying on all sets.

47:26.160 --> 47:30.439
This isn't partying, it's
just about getting smashed.

47:30.440 --> 47:35.810
He gets us drunk, we don't sleep,
then next day straight to the set.

47:36.840 --> 47:42.643
Nothing was good enough for her.
I got more and more annoyed.

47:42.920 --> 47:49.201
Eventually I just tried to
ruin everything for her.

47:49.880 --> 47:55.046
It's hard to know what to do, where
to be. Nothing's like the script.

47:55.560 --> 47:59.963
Do you know how tired we are?
We haven't showered or slept.

48:00.360 --> 48:05.605
- We don't know what's going on...
- Please leave him alone for a while.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.487
Seriously? Come here!

48:08.840 --> 48:12.731
- Really? Have they arrived?
- I've had them from the beginning.

48:14.160 --> 48:17.323
This is so weird.
It's just very wrong.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.731
- High or low?
- High.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.207
Low.

48:25.400 --> 48:29.919
- Are you using the weapons on them?
- Yes.

48:29.920 --> 48:35.723
- Try Iselin. She looks pretty gone.
- I don't have a clue about anything.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.691
Silje! Come. Come here!

48:38.880 --> 48:41.999
Just go and get it, Reinert!

48:42.000 --> 48:45.846
I want to try it, too. It's
ages since I was in the army.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.800
- High or low?
- Nine of spades!

48:57.000 --> 48:58.999
What?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.079
- Groovy!
- So say I.

49:01.080 --> 49:04.159
- High or low?
- High.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.279
Two of clubs.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.408
This is almost scary.

49:16.040 --> 49:21.604
So you don't know anything
about your character?

49:23.720 --> 49:30.330
Well, it's changing all the time,
it's making me a little schizoid...

49:37.160 --> 49:39.839
What's going on?

49:39.840 --> 49:42.047
What's going on?

49:43.640 --> 49:46.644
- I heard it, too.
- Look at her!

49:47.440 --> 49:49.679
- Low.
- Low? OK.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.682
8 of hearts!

49:52.600 --> 49:54.887
This is really sick.

50:05.320 --> 50:08.164
I'll show you something cool.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.719
I thought it shot blanks!

50:15.720 --> 50:20.726
What do you think? We're
half-way through the production.

50:22.200 --> 50:28.239
Life is wonderful. Isn't this what
we planned in the first place?

50:28.240 --> 50:32.529
But I still feel they have
to pump it up a little more.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.329
What's happening?

50:37.680 --> 50:40.843
This is Reinert's silly idea.

50:44.600 --> 50:49.970
He just wants to fuck
it all up. God damn it.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.768
Torgrim is in on it.

50:55.760 --> 50:58.001
That was low.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.481
- Do you have a light?
- No.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.489
But I do.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.802
Let's do a rehearsal.

51:29.320 --> 51:32.324
No! How many times do
I have to show you.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.968
Walk like this!

51:44.160 --> 51:46.242
OK. One more time.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.919
- What happened to your hand?
- Oh, nothing.

51:51.920 --> 51:55.439
Please focus now. Come on!

51:55.440 --> 52:00.810
Forward, forward,
forward. That's it!

52:01.040 --> 52:03.327
That's it!

52:03.560 --> 52:06.962
- Vidar, we're done.
- Yes.

52:13.400 --> 52:17.450
I can't take it anymore. This is...

52:18.320 --> 52:23.645
- There won't be any movie.
- I have never worked like this.

52:24.080 --> 52:29.007
He's just... He's completely out
of his wits. He has no respect.

52:29.200 --> 52:32.359
It was not like this when
I worked on The Whore 1.

52:32.360 --> 52:35.919
- You worked for him before?
- Yes, The Whore 1.

52:35.920 --> 52:40.960
It wasn't like this then.
Everything went according to plan.

52:41.840 --> 52:46.599
- I don't know what it is with him.
- I can't take it. I want to leave.

52:46.600 --> 52:51.003
- I'm getting pissed.
- I wouldn't been here if I knew.

52:51.480 --> 52:55.371
- Where is Irris? She's not here.
- Irris? She's there.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.970
Her sleeping bag is gone.
Everything is gone.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.761
- Where is she?
- She hasn't been here.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.729
Hello?

53:18.840 --> 53:21.764
Irris? Irris is that you?

53:24.320 --> 53:27.961
What the fuck is happening?
What is this?

53:29.240 --> 53:31.971
Hello! Irris!

53:33.760 --> 53:35.808
What the fuck! What's...

53:46.720 --> 53:50.486
No, no, no... No, don't do it!

53:57.160 --> 54:00.323
Get me out. Get me out of here!

54:06.600 --> 54:09.365
No, don't do it! Please!

54:26.240 --> 54:29.210
You cold pig!

55:18.000 --> 55:23.239
You can just go to bed.
Nothing will happen for hours.

55:23.240 --> 55:26.839
How can we sleep with the
camera rolling all the time?

55:26.840 --> 55:31.448
Vidar: They complain about the camera.
They came to make a movie.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.209
- A movie about drinking, maybe.
- Very well.

55:36.440 --> 55:41.446
- And who found that head downstairs?
- Me. It was there in the lavatory.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.800
- Who put it there?
- Was that really necessary?

55:46.600 --> 55:51.083
- In the lavatory?
- The loo. Inside?

55:51.760 --> 55:55.685
- There was a head in the loo.
- Why would you give a shit!

55:59.520 --> 56:05.766
I'm not going to clean up that shit,
We have to clean up all the time!

56:06.200 --> 56:09.568
We wash the dishes, the
glasses, everything...

56:09.880 --> 56:12.201
I'm not cleaning that damn blood.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.610
- I've been cleaning every day.
- But I sent for Lisa.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.364
But other people don't do it.

56:21.040 --> 56:24.279
- Who's not doing anything?
- Who has the most work?

56:24.280 --> 56:27.439
- Who's not doing anything?
- Who has the most work?

56:27.440 --> 56:31.445
- But you don't do anything.
- Some people don't do anything.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.359
In and out the whole day,
the whole night until dawn.

56:36.360 --> 56:40.126
- I really need some sleep.
- We're not talking about you.

56:40.560 --> 56:45.168
- But you're looking at me...
- Yes, but there are some of us...

56:45.840 --> 56:51.210
And we're not cleaning up the blood.
Those who did it, can clean it up.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.044
Blood.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.404
I don't have any
information about that...

56:59.680 --> 57:03.366
And he lied, too. No. No.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.491
Work, work, work! Come on!

57:07.360 --> 57:09.522
What's that?

57:13.040 --> 57:15.805
- Which scene are we shooting now?
- Come up!

57:16.040 --> 57:19.249
- I told you yesterday.
- Yesterday? Again and again...

57:19.920 --> 57:22.491
- Where to?
- I must talk to the director.

57:23.360 --> 57:26.204
Please? Pretty please?

57:27.720 --> 57:31.122
Come! Come on! Come here.

57:31.640 --> 57:34.530
- What are we going to do? Where?
- Come here. Come!

57:34.800 --> 57:37.690
- Come! Come.
- No. No.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.401
- No.
- Lay off!

57:40.800 --> 57:44.805
You're so freaky. Stop it! Stop it!

57:45.400 --> 57:48.961
Where are you going?
Let me go. Let me go!

57:49.440 --> 57:53.679
No! Fuck! What's wrong with you?

57:53.680 --> 57:55.682
Let me go!

57:56.440 --> 57:58.841
Let me go!

57:59.000 --> 58:00.445
No!

58:04.240 --> 58:07.210
- Reinert! Reinert!
- Reinert!

58:13.080 --> 58:16.163
Proof again that evil
always triumphs.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.203
It has been planned
for a while, and...

58:22.720 --> 58:28.966
We didn't have enough tape.
When we taped her to that tree.

58:29.920 --> 58:35.643
So after a while we noticed - when
she came to her senses-

58:35.880 --> 58:38.486
-that she got loose at once.

58:38.720 --> 58:42.088
We had to hit her on the head
many times and do re-takes.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.688
Hello?

59:05.560 --> 59:09.645
Is that you? Is it you? Vidar?

59:10.120 --> 59:12.282
Vidar!

59:13.200 --> 59:15.089
No! Hello!

59:16.720 --> 59:19.724
What... What? What! No...

59:20.000 --> 59:23.447
Yes, give me... Yes, yes, yes...

59:23.840 --> 59:26.002
Vidar!

59:26.400 --> 59:31.042
Yes, carve me up. Carve me
up like a little whore!

59:31.360 --> 59:34.682
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Vidar, Vidar, Vidar!

59:35.360 --> 59:38.250
Yes, yes, yes...

59:38.680 --> 59:41.650
Yes! Vidar! Vidar! Vida...

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.248
- He was crazy yesterday.
- What are you reading?

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.131
I'm reading your magazine.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.682
Magazine for swine.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.329
- Do you think that's pretty?
- I wouldn't call it pretty.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.527
He was drunk as always, with his
cigarette and bottle as always.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.048
There's nothing wrong with this.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.569
I don't know what...
what it says...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.642
It's like. It's about... A cat.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.248
Some bloody business.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.961
I'm afraid to look in the mirror
and see the horns behind me.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.479
- I'm jittery.
- Me, too.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.482
It's so strange now.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.840
Did you hear that?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.163
No one can feel safe now.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.559
He was different at the audition.
That is why we came here.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.688
Look at him!

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.481
Golly, golly...

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.162
I'm going out. I'm so scared
I almost peed my pants.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.569
I really don't know
about Reinert anymore.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.609
First he's here, then he's gone,
then he smiles, then he talks...

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.527
You never know what's
going to happen.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.971
- You might say this is odd.
- But there's lots of pretty girls!

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.243
And they're the
perfect age, really:

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.365
Innocent and stupid.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.050
Are you thinking about something
that has happened to you?

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.482
That, too. I'm thinking about
things that make me sad and scared.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.003
- Like what?
- You don't have to know.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.161
I won't tell you.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.566
- Why not?
- Because it's personal.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.247
You like to make fun of Norway.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:49.881
I like to make fun of everything.
That's the most important thing.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.847
It's easier to talk about it
when you can make fun of it.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.683
Reinert, there's
somebody back there!

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.164
It's Isabel.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.651
Yes, I saw Isabel Vibe from part 1,
she's there in the apple orchard.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.482
She's back there! I'm high on speed
and overact like a monkey's jerkoff.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.967
Who's responsible for this
production? That's me!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.369
Remember last time in part 1:
no girl managed to do this.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.366
- Seriously...
- Yes, yes...

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.605
Stop giggling, be serious. We're
behind, we have to get it done.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.843
Pang!

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.086
Gimme the camera, man.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.528
I hate being filmed!

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.809
He was in the office a while ago.
He was going to clean the wound.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.970
He's just so... He's so angry.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.528
I'm horny.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.884
I'm horny all the time. The blood and
Reinert's male body makes me so hot.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.129
I don't understand how he
makes my cunt so fucking wet.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.970
There must be something
supernatural to his presence.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.119
- Oh! Look!
- Who is that?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.009
Are you OK?

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.446
We are on day four...

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.607
- Who are you?
- It's Vidar, our cameraman.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.720
- That pig never turns off the camera!
- I'm so fed up.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.359
- How do you think things are going?
- Damn well.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.886
We've managed to fool
all the girls by now.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.245
I think we'll pull it off.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.086
Where is everybody?

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.888
Was that you?

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.246
It's all the time!

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.082
- Have you met Reinert before?
- Only from some audition.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.207
I have to try to fix your
wound. It looks bad.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.645
Ah... Stop it!

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:44.323
This is getting weirder
and weirder...

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:48.045
Suddenly you realize that the world
is not so innocent and lovely.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.088
Evil always wins.
The victory dance of evil.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.522
Look at the body of that girl.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.603
I'm all nerves all the time,
almost peeing in my pants.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.723
I don't know who he... Reinert.
I don't know who he is anymore.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.611
It was me who contacted him.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.766
I really wanted to be
part of Inside The Whore.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.646
Was it worth it?
Do you think it was worth it?

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.802
No, this is so unprofessional,
not serious at all.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.566
- Lisa. Lisa!
- Come in!

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.966
- Fuck me!
- Oh!

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.085
Oh! I want to bleed from my cunt.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.887
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.851
Have you seen Lisa?

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.291
Stop filming!

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.370
Have you looked yourself in
the mirror? You look fucked up!

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.128
What's next on the list?

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.519
You look nasty with
that witch's nose.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.320
- You're looking very old.
- It feels like that.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.282
Alien autopsy for Reinert Kill.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.847
Well, it's almost 09:35.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:07.321
We have worked for twelve, thirteen,
fourteen... sixteen, nineteen hours.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.966
We're on day six.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.287
And we're about to start
on the second rape scene.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.568
Isn't that right?

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.171
We need you on the set.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.119
Reinert, it has been a fantastic
pleasure working with you.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:19.159
At last be able to
make real film art.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:26.044
I hope you are as satisfied with
my work as I am with yours...

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.127
What the fuck has happened to you?

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.201
Fuck you. I trusted
you, you arrogant rat!

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.283
Oh...

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.801
I'll be glad when we're done.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.525
She sounds like a cat
getting strangled.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.689
I'm fed up.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.682
Reinert, do you think that you can
finish this film without my help?

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.689
This is yours and mine project.
Yo cannot sidetrack me like that.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.408
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.368
I have my own private movie.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.560
You will never finish this film
without me, and you know it.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.321
Do you understand what I say?
You will never...

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.688
My girl!

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.530
Then we're almost finished.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.048
- Only the credits left.
- Yes, sir!

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.041
You too must be penetrated.

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.919
I've never seen anything
more perverted.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.083
What the fuck do they
think they're doing?

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.599
We can't authorize this.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.766
Where is the distributor?
This is a scandal!

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.449
Dagrun, hello?

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.439
She has passed out!

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.679
She's passed out!
Get that distributor here now!

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.811
- Come here!
- This film is banned!

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.968
I repeat: this film will never ever
be shown in a Norwegian cinema!

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:48.211
Hell has dawned on
you, you bloody cunt.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.888
Thank you!
