WEBVTT

03:34.591 --> 03:35.592
Father?

03:35.758 --> 03:38.595
Henry, what have you done?

03:39.095 --> 03:40.096
I said I'd find you.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.932
Look at me, son.

03:45.518 --> 03:46.853
I don't care.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.772
There's no place for you
on the «Dutchman».

03:52.859 --> 03:54.444
They know you're here.

03:54.944 --> 03:55.945
Get home to your mother.

03:56.137 --> 03:56.937
No!

03:57.030 --> 03:58.281
Leave now!

03:59.115 --> 04:00.116
Before it's too late.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.535
I won't! I'll never stop.

04:02.702 --> 04:05.914
And if you throw me over,
I'll come straight back.

04:07.624 --> 04:09.086
Don't you see I'm cursed to this ship?

04:09.626 --> 04:10.710
That's why I'm here.

04:10.877 --> 04:12.754
I think I know a way to break your curse.

04:12.921 --> 04:14.230
To free you from the «Dutchman».

04:14.297 --> 04:15.798
Henry, no.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.110
I've read about a treasure.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.427
A treasure that holds
all the power of the sea.

04:19.594 --> 04:22.137
The Trident of Poseidon
can break your curse.

04:25.308 --> 04:29.395
Henry, the Trident can never be found.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.773
I found you.

04:32.565 --> 04:33.942
It's just a tale.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.611
Like the tales of you
and Captain Jack Sparrow?

04:37.153 --> 04:38.613
He will help me find the Trident.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.823
You stay away from Jack.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.533
Leave the sea forever.

04:42.559 --> 04:43.752
You have to stop acting like...

04:43.785 --> 04:44.953
A pirate?

04:45.119 --> 04:47.163
I won't stop.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.749
I want you to come home.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.132
Henry...

04:58.257 --> 04:59.842
I'm sorry.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.429
But my curse will never be broken.

05:05.932 --> 05:08.184
This is my fate.

05:08.351 --> 05:11.145
You must let me go.

05:16.693 --> 05:18.820
I love you, son.

05:46.556 --> 05:49.267
Captain Jack Sparrow.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.038
Keep even keel.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.749
Haul in on the lee side!

06:12.915 --> 06:15.918
Faster, you pathetic bilge rats!

06:16.085 --> 06:18.755
You'll pump the bilge
and fill the scuppers.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.840
We're chasing down pirates!

06:21.007 --> 06:22.759
Henry, get back here.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.761
You don't wanna get kicked off
another ship.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.137
It's a Dutch barque.

06:26.304 --> 06:28.181
Probably stolen by the Pirate Bonnet.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.399
My God.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.194
I warned you of leaving your post, boy.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.620
I need to speak with the captain.

06:42.653 --> 06:43.946
- What did you say?
- Move!

06:44.113 --> 06:45.740
Turner!

06:52.246 --> 06:53.748
She's going in, sir.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.459
Chase her down.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.632
No, don't do it.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.258
Don't do it!

07:04.342 --> 07:06.636
You will not address the captain, boy.

07:06.803 --> 07:08.012
Sir, look at your charts.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.223
I believe you're sailing us
into the Devil's Triangle.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.724
You hear this, men?

07:11.849 --> 07:14.435
This landsman believes
an old sailor's myth.

07:15.353 --> 07:16.521
Sir, with all due respect,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.528
I have spent my life studying
the myths of the sea.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.149
I know every legend and every curse.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.318
And I know ships that
sail into the Triangle

07:22.385 --> 07:23.620
do not necessarily sail out...

07:23.653 --> 07:27.115
I'm sorry, sir.
This one is clearly disturbed.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.784
Sir, trust in what I say.
Change your course.

07:29.951 --> 07:31.828
You dare to give me orders, boy?

07:31.994 --> 07:32.794
Arrest him!

07:33.830 --> 07:34.872
Turner!

07:34.956 --> 07:36.374
I will not let you kill us all.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.811
This is treason.

07:58.688 --> 07:59.488
No.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.607
- Lock him up. We're going in!
- No!

08:01.774 --> 08:04.360
Belay that starboard brace.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.195
Bind that line!

08:06.362 --> 08:07.363
Stay to the chains!

08:08.114 --> 08:10.366
This was your last chance, Turner.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.078
If it were up to me,

08:14.203 --> 08:16.164
I'd string you from the yardarm.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.373
On deck.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.173
Hold steady, helmsman!

08:26.215 --> 08:28.676
Jack Sparrow.

08:28.843 --> 08:30.052
He's dead.

08:30.219 --> 08:33.890
Buried in an unmarked grave
on the Isle of Saint Martin.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.506
Sir, there's something in the water.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.635
Ship to starboard!

09:12.803 --> 09:16.599
That's no ship, sir. It's a shipwreck.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.568
No.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.779
She's sailing straight toward us.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.031
Open fire!

09:33.741 --> 09:35.159
Open fire!

09:36.994 --> 09:38.079
Reload!

09:55.429 --> 09:56.764
Secure the deck!

10:51.861 --> 10:52.862
What are you?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.953
Death.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.759
Jack Sparrow.

11:56.842 --> 11:57.843
Shh!

12:02.431 --> 12:04.183
Do you know this pirate?

12:05.476 --> 12:07.061
Only by name.

12:07.228 --> 12:08.604
You're looking for him?

12:16.195 --> 12:17.488
Is that a "yes"?

12:18.114 --> 12:19.365
Yes.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.327
For too many years,
the Triangle has cursed us...

12:23.494 --> 12:26.622
condemned us to this hell on Earth.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.501
The key to our escape is Jack Sparrow...

12:30.668 --> 12:32.670
and the compass which he holds.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.423
No need to fear me, boy.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.676
I always leave one man alive
to tell the tale.

12:39.552 --> 12:42.346
Find Sparrow for me...

12:42.513 --> 12:45.808
and relay a message from Captain Salazar.

12:45.975 --> 12:47.435
Salazar.

12:48.936 --> 12:53.274
Tell him I will behold the daylight again.

12:53.441 --> 12:55.609
And on that day...

13:00.156 --> 13:01.991
death...

13:02.700 --> 13:06.495
death will come straight for him.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.581
Would you say that to him?

13:08.747 --> 13:09.582
Please?

13:09.748 --> 13:10.548
Yes.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.252
I wish I could do it myself, but...

13:14.295 --> 13:16.630
dead men tell no tales.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!

13:45.034 --> 13:48.537
"Carina Smyth, you're an orphan born
of the devil..."

13:48.954 --> 13:51.499
accused of practicing witchcraft.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.958
Before you die...

13:53.584 --> 13:55.836
do you have anything to confess?

13:58.088 --> 14:00.925
I confess that I'm not a witch,

14:01.008 --> 14:02.801
that I am a woman of science.

14:03.219 --> 14:05.763
I confess that
I have survived on my own...

14:05.930 --> 14:09.475
with nothing but a diary from
the father I never knew...

14:09.642 --> 14:12.186
and a quest for the truth of who I am.

14:12.353 --> 14:16.148
I confess that I will die
before I give up the search.

14:16.315 --> 14:17.900
And I confess...

14:18.692 --> 14:21.246
that while we've been talking,
I picked this lock.

14:29.036 --> 14:33.707
Today, we dedicate
the Royal Bank of Saint Martin.

14:39.296 --> 14:43.592
The most secure banking
institution in the Caribbean.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.479
Our new vault is five inches thick...

14:55.646 --> 14:57.773
and weighs an imperial ton.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.192
I've got her! I've got her!

15:00.568 --> 15:01.569
Get her!

15:01.735 --> 15:04.905
Don't let her get away! Stop that witch!

15:07.575 --> 15:10.536
Stop her! She's there! Get out of the way!

15:10.744 --> 15:11.954
Get out of my way!

15:13.289 --> 15:14.748
With this bank...

15:14.915 --> 15:19.587
the town of Saint Martin
enters the modern world.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.262
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- The witch escaped her chains.

15:29.013 --> 15:32.308
Find that wicked lass,
or you'll swing in her place.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.642
Sir.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.102
Sir.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.315
No man nor an army...

15:39.481 --> 15:43.652
can ever rob the gold from Saint Martin.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.572
Open the vault.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.087
Pirate!

16:02.796 --> 16:04.840
Pirates.

16:05.591 --> 16:06.842
Pirate!

16:18.729 --> 16:19.730
Hmm.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.652
This may seem a peculiar request...

16:24.818 --> 16:28.906
but could someone explain
to me as to why I'm here?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.245
Scrum.

16:37.873 --> 16:38.874
How long?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.752
No, wait, it's coming to me.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.797
I need just a moment to clear me head.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.174
Make ready!

16:47.466 --> 16:48.467
Present!

16:52.221 --> 16:53.097
Hold your fire!

16:53.806 --> 16:55.808
There's a woman with him in the vault!

16:59.520 --> 17:01.730
Never mind about that trollop.

17:01.897 --> 17:05.358
Sir, I believe that's your wife.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.156
Frances?

17:14.284 --> 17:15.786
Right, I've got it.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.873
I've got it! I'm robbing the bank!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.000
- Shoot him!
- Ooh!

17:26.380 --> 17:27.180
Come on!

17:28.132 --> 17:28.932
Pull!

17:35.347 --> 17:36.390
Pull!

17:37.766 --> 17:38.566
Come on!

18:07.546 --> 18:09.590
That was not part of the plan.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.552
After him! Don't let him get away!

18:19.641 --> 18:21.894
Yo! Come on!

18:34.823 --> 18:36.116
Oh, oh!

18:50.881 --> 18:52.189
Well, I got this mutton, didn't I?

18:52.257 --> 18:53.717
Oh, that was too expensive.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.614
No woman's ever handled my Herschel.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.207
Clear a path!

19:26.375 --> 19:28.377
Oh, no, no, no!

19:31.171 --> 19:32.881
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19:36.718 --> 19:38.011
Get inside!

19:45.561 --> 19:46.728
Hard to starboard.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.330
"Sir."

20:05.455 --> 20:07.082
Your celestial fix was off.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.709
I've adjusted two degrees North.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.627
Your map will no longer be imprecise.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.525
Although you will
have to start again with it.

20:12.588 --> 20:13.463
You're a witch.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.090
No, I'm not.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.260
Am I a witch for having
catalogued over 200 stars?

20:18.427 --> 20:19.227
Witch!

20:21.346 --> 20:22.848
There is a blood moon coming.

20:23.473 --> 20:27.185
I simply need to purchase a chronometer.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.511
I'll pay you double
for selling to a woman.

20:29.688 --> 20:30.488
Help!

20:31.773 --> 20:33.275
There's a witch in my shop!

20:33.692 --> 20:34.492
Help!

20:35.360 --> 20:37.654
Help! There's a witch in my shop!

20:39.489 --> 20:42.951
And a pirate! There's a witch
and a pirate in my shop!

20:43.118 --> 20:45.120
Well, it's your lucky day!

20:45.287 --> 20:47.706
Have either of the four of you
seen my bank?

20:51.001 --> 20:52.002
Found it!

20:55.756 --> 20:57.299
Were you part of the plan?

20:57.466 --> 20:58.800
I'm not looking for trouble.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.969
What a horrible way to live.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.228
Stop that witch! Get her!

21:10.729 --> 21:12.814
We're trapped. What do we do?

21:12.981 --> 21:14.316
Yeah, there she is! Quickly!

21:16.026 --> 21:17.861
You need to scream.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.699
Over there! Secure that woman!

21:25.035 --> 21:26.078
You filthy pirate!

21:26.244 --> 21:28.163
No need for name-calling!

21:40.175 --> 21:41.343
Come on, lads!

22:04.700 --> 22:05.500
Jack!

22:06.535 --> 22:07.536
Huh?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.040
Bridge?

22:47.284 --> 22:48.285
It's empty!

22:49.578 --> 22:50.495
Where is the dosh?

22:50.662 --> 22:53.081
Do you think that robbing a bank is easy?

22:53.248 --> 22:56.084
You gaggle of gutless
heels of the womb's guilty...

22:56.251 --> 22:59.296
of putting me in this dreadful
pickle in the first place.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.423
Now line up and offer me your tribute.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.092
You want us to pay you?

23:04.259 --> 23:06.595
Am I not the captain of this ship?

23:07.262 --> 23:09.473
You call this a ship?

23:09.639 --> 23:11.016
Where's the treasure?

23:11.183 --> 23:12.642
All of us are starving.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.270
We will no longer follow
a captain without a ship.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.105
I have a ship.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.525
«Black Pearl» has never left me side.

23:21.735 --> 23:24.946
The pirate Barbossa rules these seas now.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.616
Has 10 ships, guns full.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.284
Not to mention his cannonballs.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.286
18 pounds each they say.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.829
One-legged man with 18 pound balls?

23:33.955 --> 23:35.624
That's why he walks funny.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.417
Oh, come, come, mates.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.836
Did we not find the Treasure
of Macedonia together?

23:40.337 --> 23:41.588
It was a troll of rotten wood.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.632
- Gold of King Midas.
- Pile of donkey dung.

23:43.799 --> 23:45.634
Face it, Jack.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.844
Bad luck dogs you day and night.

23:48.011 --> 23:51.056
Now that is a blatant fabrication.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.812
You've lost your luck.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.230
You've lost your ship.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.650
Now, you've lost your crew.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.611
Jack Sparrow is no longer our captain.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.492
I'm sorry, Jack.

24:10.659 --> 24:13.161
But we've reached the end of the horizon.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.590
Right then.

24:26.883 --> 24:29.010
You're all dismissed. Eh?

24:29.177 --> 24:31.721
All of ya, dismissed.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.349
You'll never sail with
Captain Jack Sparrow again,

24:34.432 --> 24:35.433
tell you that.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.150
The whole town speaks of you.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.444
The only survivor of the «Monarch».

25:27.611 --> 25:29.571
A boy who paddled all the way
to Saint Martin

25:29.654 --> 25:31.990
against the tide on a piece of driftwood.

25:32.157 --> 25:36.745
Found jabbering about pirates
and tridents.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.247
Please, sir, let me go of these chains.

25:39.414 --> 25:42.834
My job is to protect
this island and these waters.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.587
And your sleeves have been ripped.

25:47.172 --> 25:48.340
The mark of treason.

25:48.506 --> 25:49.758
We were attacked by the dead...

25:49.925 --> 25:51.927
You're a coward who ran from battle.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.471
And that is how you'll die.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.026
I don't believe you're a coward.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.611
Please leave me, sister.

26:09.945 --> 26:12.030
I've risked my life to come here,

26:12.113 --> 26:13.782
to see if the rumours are true.

26:13.949 --> 26:15.450
You speak of the Trident?

26:16.451 --> 26:17.452
Who are you?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.829
Tell me why you seek the Trident.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.959
The Trident can break any curse at sea.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.295
My father is trapped by such a curse.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.798
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

26:29.965 --> 26:31.049
Neither are ghosts.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.135
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.804
Then why did you come here?

26:35.971 --> 26:38.014
Because I need to get off this island.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.558
- To solve «The Map No Man»...
- «No Man Can Read».

26:40.725 --> 26:42.811
Left by Poseidon himself.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.523
You've read the ancient text?

26:46.690 --> 26:49.192
In each language they were written.

26:50.694 --> 26:54.030
But this map has never been
seen nor read by any man.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.825
Luckily, I'm a woman.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.872
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.583
He spent his life
searching for the Trident.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.419
It's why he invented the spyglass...

27:07.585 --> 27:09.047
why astronomers have spent their lives

27:09.129 --> 27:10.171
staring into the sky.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.217
So you're saying «The Map No Man Can Read»

27:14.301 --> 27:15.427
is hidden in the stars?

27:16.052 --> 27:17.512
It was left to me by my father.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.974
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found

27:21.057 --> 27:23.059
and I will not let him down.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.854
Soon there will be a blood moon.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.273
Only then can the map be read.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.358
And the Trident found.

27:31.026 --> 27:31.901
Who are you?

27:32.068 --> 27:34.362
Carina Smyth.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.780
If you wish to save your father,

27:35.864 --> 27:36.865
you'll have to save me.

27:37.032 --> 27:39.034
Find us a ship
and the Trident will be ours.

27:41.036 --> 27:43.038
Turn to me, witch.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.001
Hold.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.593
He's gone!

27:57.260 --> 27:58.636
He's gone, sir!

28:01.264 --> 28:03.058
Find that coward.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.726
He'll hang with the witch.

28:04.809 --> 28:05.810
Move out!

28:07.270 --> 28:10.148
Think Captain Jack's washed up, eh?

28:10.899 --> 28:14.069
I've not had a wash in years.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.778
Check the alley down there.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.826
You two, check the church.
The rest of you, with me.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.126
Bugger.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.148
May I please have a drink, please?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.109
Show me your silver.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.027
Silver?

29:02.325 --> 29:04.035
How about a trade?

29:06.663 --> 29:08.206
Give me the bottle.

30:03.261 --> 30:06.347
«Capitán», what's happening?
[Captain, skipper]

30:11.269 --> 30:12.854
Jack Sparrow.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.356
Jack Sparrow has given away the compass.

30:27.702 --> 30:29.871
Daylight. Daylight.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.389
We are free!

30:55.897 --> 31:00.235
Now, now. It's time to hunt a pirate.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.244
Pirate's life.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.380
Come to daddy. Oh!

31:21.506 --> 31:23.258
Just the man we've been looking for.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.176
Why? Why am I looked for?

31:25.343 --> 31:27.845
Let it be known
that the pirate, Jack Sparrow,

31:27.929 --> 31:29.973
will be executed at dawn.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.432
Executed?

31:31.599 --> 31:34.936
I will never set foot
in this town again, sir.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.145
You mark my words.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.647
Dead now, you cur.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.357
I do mean it, you know.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.609
I shall never be back here again.

33:10.365 --> 33:11.532
Huh.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.587
"To release the power of the sea..."

33:25.588 --> 33:27.215
"all must divide."

33:31.302 --> 33:32.887
It's an island.

33:33.221 --> 33:35.390
The stars lead to an island.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.318
Look right here, sir.

33:47.485 --> 33:49.737
Very good. Take the rest to the cells.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.658
I'm looking for a pirate. Jack Sparrow.

33:53.825 --> 33:55.159
Bugger off.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.582
Psst. I need to speak with you.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.422
Hand me your sword.

34:08.589 --> 34:09.590
I don't have a sword.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.676
What kind of soldier has no weapon?

34:11.842 --> 34:13.678
I'm currently wanted for treason.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.304
So not the very good kind then.

34:16.472 --> 34:19.308
I'm looking for a pirate.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.686
Well, today is your lucky day.

34:22.770 --> 34:28.275
'Cause I just happen to be
Captain Jack Sparrow.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.532
No, it can't be.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.452
I've spent years searching for... this?

34:37.952 --> 34:40.788
The great Jack Sparrow
is not some drunk in a cell.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.958
Do you even have a ship? A crew?

34:45.293 --> 34:46.543
Pants?

34:47.128 --> 34:49.839
A great pirate does not
require such intricacies.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.300
Do you know how long I've been
waiting for this moment?

34:52.467 --> 34:54.510
The risks I've taken to be here.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.219
Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?

34:56.387 --> 34:58.806
Real question is, who are you?

34:58.973 --> 35:00.558
My name is Henry Turner.

35:00.725 --> 35:02.602
Son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.

35:02.685 --> 35:03.728
Ugh!

35:03.936 --> 35:05.980
You're the evil spawn of them two?

35:06.856 --> 35:08.900
Does mommy ever ask about me?

35:09.066 --> 35:09.866
No.

35:09.984 --> 35:10.985
Oh, go on.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.321
She call my name in her sleep?

35:13.488 --> 35:15.031
She never spoke of you.

35:15.823 --> 35:18.159
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?

35:18.326 --> 35:19.827
He's a cursed eunuch.

35:19.994 --> 35:23.748
She's golden-haired, stubborn, pouty lips.

35:23.915 --> 35:27.251
Neck like a giraffe.
And two of those wonderful...

35:27.418 --> 35:29.378
Yes! Yes, it's her.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.131
I need you to listen, Jack,

35:32.256 --> 35:34.175
because at the moment you're all I've got.

35:34.342 --> 35:36.344
I found a way to save my father.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.179
There is one thing
that can break his curse

35:38.262 --> 35:39.680
and free him from the «Dutchman».

35:41.933 --> 35:43.267
The Trident of Poseidon.

35:43.768 --> 35:45.019
Ah.

35:45.603 --> 35:50.441
The treasure to be found with
«The Map That No Man Can Read».

35:53.110 --> 35:54.403
Never heard of it.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.698
There is a girl inside this prison, Jack,

35:57.865 --> 35:58.866
who holds that map.

35:59.033 --> 36:01.702
The moon has turned to blood,
the Trident will be found...

36:01.769 --> 36:03.546
and you could be the one
who holds the sea...

36:03.579 --> 36:05.581
and with it become all that you once were.

36:05.748 --> 36:07.583
The great...

36:08.751 --> 36:09.585
Jack!

36:10.753 --> 36:12.713
I'm so sorry. Were you still talking?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.382
I believe I nodded off a bit.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.051
One more thing.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.719
A message from someone you know,

36:18.803 --> 36:20.221
named Captain Salazar.

36:23.391 --> 36:25.560
I once knew a Spaniard named...

36:26.477 --> 36:28.312
something in Spanish.

36:30.565 --> 36:31.691
The Butcher of the Sea.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.734
Him? No, no.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.946
Quite happily, he's dead. Very, very dead.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.156
- Ship went down.
- Inside the Triangle.

36:40.408 --> 36:41.534
He's coming for you, Jack,

36:41.617 --> 36:44.120
to seek revenge as
the dead man's tale is told.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.663
I don't believe you.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.333
What did he say?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.752
He said your compass
was the key to his escape.

36:52.169 --> 36:54.839
An army of dead are coming
straight for you, Jack.

36:55.006 --> 36:57.592
The Trident of Poseidon is your only hope.

36:59.427 --> 37:01.262
Do we have an accord?

37:09.353 --> 37:11.314
Well, I'm not going in there to tell him.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.815
It was your idea.

37:12.982 --> 37:15.860
No, it was my idea for you to tell him.

37:16.027 --> 37:17.528
He likes you more than me.

37:17.695 --> 37:19.280
He doesn't like anybody.

37:42.470 --> 37:43.554
Sorry, sir.

37:43.721 --> 37:45.306
We know you said never to disturb you.

37:45.473 --> 37:47.224
Or to come in without good cause.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.644
Or to speak without first, um...

37:50.645 --> 37:52.063
Asking ourselves...

37:52.229 --> 37:55.024
Whether our thoughts
were absolutely necessary.

37:55.191 --> 37:56.984
Like the time the ship was on fire.

37:57.151 --> 37:59.695
That being an example
of necessary thought.

37:59.862 --> 38:02.406
Sir, again, we do apologise
for starting that fire.

38:09.497 --> 38:10.831
Speak.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.917
It's your ships, sir.

38:13.084 --> 38:16.337
They're being attacked by
an enemy that takes no riches.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.297
Kills without provocation.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.548
My ships?

38:19.715 --> 38:21.175
Not possible.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.427
Three have already been sunk, sir.

38:23.844 --> 38:26.514
They've been sunk by
a captain called Salamander.

38:26.639 --> 38:27.848
Samovar.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.685
Salazar.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.353
That's it, your sirness.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.856
He leaves one man from
each vessel to tell the tale.

38:36.023 --> 38:39.068
The entire fleet is being sunk...

38:39.235 --> 38:42.363
and we'll soon be dead.

38:42.530 --> 38:45.783
And quite possibly out of business.

38:51.455 --> 38:54.166
I'll be needing some time with your witch.

39:09.015 --> 39:10.850
I've been expecting you, Captain.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.478
Perhaps you'd like some tea?

39:17.565 --> 39:19.775
I shall pass. Thank ye kindly.

39:21.277 --> 39:25.114
The price of crossing my door
is blood, Captain.

39:25.281 --> 39:28.325
That explains why you're not so busy.

39:28.909 --> 39:31.454
Everyone pays eventually.

39:32.705 --> 39:35.082
Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.752
I saved you from the gallows, remember?

39:37.918 --> 39:40.421
And I cursed your enemies.

39:40.588 --> 39:43.007
But now you come to me in fear,

39:43.090 --> 39:46.010
as the dead have taken command of the sea.

39:46.177 --> 39:48.304
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?

39:49.388 --> 39:51.682
Not you, Captain.

39:51.849 --> 39:54.268
They're searching for a Sparrow.

39:54.852 --> 39:56.103
Jack?

39:58.606 --> 40:01.484
Jack will sail for the Trident...

40:01.650 --> 40:05.029
with a girl and a «Pearl».

40:05.696 --> 40:08.282
The Trident can never be found.

40:11.786 --> 40:14.789
The Trident is Jack's only hope.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.707
The dead are conquering the sea,

40:16.791 --> 40:19.376
unable to step on dry land.

40:22.004 --> 40:25.883
Maybe you should retire
to the countryside.

40:27.301 --> 40:31.639
You mean grass? On a farm?

40:31.806 --> 40:37.686
Milkin' a cow, makin' cheese,
while they sink my treasure?

40:37.853 --> 40:40.731
Ask yourself this, Captain.

40:40.898 --> 40:43.776
Is this a treasure worth dying for?

40:43.943 --> 40:45.569
I'm a pirate.

40:45.736 --> 40:47.196
Always will be.

40:47.363 --> 40:49.907
So how do I save what be mine?

40:50.074 --> 40:51.492
Jack held a compass

40:51.575 --> 40:54.537
which points you
to the thing you desire most.

40:54.703 --> 40:56.872
But betray the compass,

40:56.956 --> 40:59.291
and it releases your greatest fear.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.962
A pirate's greatest fear
be Salazar, is it?

41:06.632 --> 41:07.842
How did you get this?

41:08.008 --> 41:09.718
I have my ways.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.763
Lead them to Jack
before he finds the Trident...

41:12.930 --> 41:16.517
and all your treasure
will come back to you.

41:18.144 --> 41:20.938
Time to make a deal with the dead.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.443
Come on, pirate!

41:32.908 --> 41:34.118
Hold on. Stop!

41:34.285 --> 41:36.120
Dad?

41:39.456 --> 41:40.624
Uncle Jack!

41:40.791 --> 41:43.252
Jackie boy! How's it going?

41:43.419 --> 41:45.004
Can't complain really. You?

41:45.212 --> 41:47.506
I've been waitin' all morning
in here for a beating.

41:47.673 --> 41:48.966
But the service is terrible.

41:49.425 --> 41:50.259
Shameful.

41:51.552 --> 41:52.636
Jack.

41:53.971 --> 41:55.848
The oceans have turned to blood.

41:56.015 --> 41:59.185
Best to stay on dry land where it's safe.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.188
I'm about to be executed on dry land.

42:02.813 --> 42:03.856
Good point.

42:04.023 --> 42:05.793
Did I ever tell you
the one about the skeleton?

42:06.442 --> 42:07.985
Yes, you have. Many times, in fact.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.153
Skeleton goes into a bar...

42:09.320 --> 42:11.572
orders a beer and a mop.

42:13.949 --> 42:14.867
Funny as ever.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.369
Come on, let's go.

42:18.287 --> 42:21.290
Oh, if they disembowel you,
ask for Victor.

42:21.457 --> 42:23.042
He's got the softest hands.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.419
- Thank you!
- And mention my name.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.463
They won't cut your feet off.

42:47.399 --> 42:50.110
Come on. You're up first.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.990
And how would you like to die, pirate?

42:55.407 --> 42:57.868
Hanging, firing squad,

42:57.952 --> 43:00.454
or a new invention: the guillotine.

43:00.621 --> 43:03.123
Guillotine? Sounds French.

43:03.290 --> 43:04.291
I love the French.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.210
Did you know that
they invented mayonnaise?

43:06.377 --> 43:08.921
How bad could it be? It's French, eh?

43:12.091 --> 43:13.133
Oh, well, then.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.969
I've changed me mind!

43:20.808 --> 43:22.393
No, please! Have mercy upon me!

43:22.476 --> 43:23.936
I'm a bed-wetter.

43:41.787 --> 43:42.746
Oh, come on.

43:42.830 --> 43:44.999
I mean, I have to walk
upstairs as well for this?

43:45.165 --> 43:46.125
Bring the basket.

43:47.293 --> 43:48.711
Basket? Why?

43:50.212 --> 43:51.130
Strap him down!

43:59.430 --> 44:01.974
Here's an idea. Here's an idea.

44:02.433 --> 44:04.318
Why don't we try a good
old-fashioned stoning, eh?

44:04.435 --> 44:06.270
I'd kill to be stoned right now.

44:06.353 --> 44:08.188
Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it?

44:08.355 --> 44:10.607
I should like to speak
to Victor in Disembowelment.

44:10.774 --> 44:12.359
I should like to speak to...

44:13.068 --> 44:15.237
I'm not one to complain normally,

44:15.362 --> 44:17.740
but this basket's full of heads.

44:26.832 --> 44:28.417
The final words of Carina Smyth.

44:29.251 --> 44:30.878
Quiet!

44:35.215 --> 44:36.675
The final words of Carina Smyth.

44:37.885 --> 44:39.970
Good sirs, I'm not a witch...

44:40.137 --> 44:41.764
but I forgive your common dimwittedness

44:41.889 --> 44:43.557
and feeble brains.

44:43.724 --> 44:45.726
In short, most of you
have the mind of a goat.

44:45.893 --> 44:47.102
Pardon me, sir.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.500
Is it not common practice for
those about to be executed...

44:49.646 --> 44:52.107
to be granted a last,
I don't know, something...

44:52.274 --> 44:53.484
I believe I was making a point.

44:53.567 --> 44:55.277
If you could just be patient.

44:55.444 --> 44:56.653
No!

44:56.820 --> 44:59.531
My head's about to be
lopped off, hence the urgency.

44:59.698 --> 45:01.075
And my neck is to be broken.

45:01.241 --> 45:02.910
Did you know that on occasion,

45:03.035 --> 45:04.266
the neck doesn't actually break?

45:04.370 --> 45:05.204
It just hurts.

45:05.371 --> 45:07.039
- What?
- Oh, yes.

45:07.289 --> 45:08.707
I've seen men swing for hours,

45:08.832 --> 45:10.209
eyes bulging, tongues swelling...

45:10.542 --> 45:12.586
- revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?

45:12.753 --> 45:13.754
No! You're lucky.

45:14.171 --> 45:15.255
Wish I was hung.

45:16.507 --> 45:18.842
- Kill the filthy pirate. I'll wait.
- But witches first.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.011
I'm not a witch. Were you not listening?

45:21.095 --> 45:22.096
Quite hard to listen

45:22.100 --> 45:23.460
when you have the mind of a goat.

45:23.472 --> 45:24.765
Enough! Kill them both!

45:46.787 --> 45:48.205
Get another noose!

45:48.372 --> 45:50.624
Did you think you could defeat us, boy?

45:50.791 --> 45:51.591
No, sir.

45:51.792 --> 45:53.293
I'm just the diversion.

45:54.128 --> 45:55.462
Fire!

46:21.572 --> 46:23.407
Still rather be stoned!

46:28.620 --> 46:29.705
Reload!

46:46.805 --> 46:47.806
Ugh!

46:49.766 --> 46:51.059
Thank you.

46:54.855 --> 46:55.655
Die!

47:00.819 --> 47:03.530
- Come here, you pirate scum!
- Hey, hey!

47:08.952 --> 47:10.412
Oh, no.

47:13.123 --> 47:15.000
What are you doing? No, no, no!

47:15.459 --> 47:16.376
Careful!

47:25.677 --> 47:26.553
Horses?

47:28.430 --> 47:29.473
Oh!

47:45.531 --> 47:46.365
Thank you!

47:46.907 --> 47:47.866
You're welcome, me lady.

47:49.284 --> 47:50.244
Got you!

47:56.542 --> 47:58.377
Knew you'd come crawling back, traitor.

47:58.544 --> 48:00.796
The Turner boy gave us 10 silver pieces

48:00.879 --> 48:02.422
to save your neck.

48:09.263 --> 48:10.931
From this moment on, we are to be allies.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.460
Considering where your left hand is,

48:12.465 --> 48:13.581
I'd say we're more than that.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.560
We find the Trident together.
Do I have your word?

48:15.570 --> 48:17.280
You're holding everything but my word.

48:17.604 --> 48:19.898
Then I bestow upon you
the honour of saving me

48:19.982 --> 48:21.191
for a small donation.

48:21.358 --> 48:23.902
You expect us to pay you to save you?

48:25.279 --> 48:26.280
Yes.

48:27.990 --> 48:29.199
For a mere 10 pieces.

48:35.706 --> 48:37.040
Madness!

48:37.207 --> 48:38.834
We won't pay more than five!

48:39.001 --> 48:41.295
Well, then... Eight it is.

48:41.361 --> 48:42.805
Perhaps we could discuss this later

48:42.838 --> 48:44.415
as I'm having trouble hoisting your port!

48:44.464 --> 48:46.592
You are far from port. That is my stern.

48:46.675 --> 48:47.843
Are you sure?

48:48.010 --> 48:48.810
Positive.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.721
Well, look at this.

48:51.138 --> 48:53.890
If I kill the coward, the witch hangs.

48:54.266 --> 48:55.642
Two for the price of one.

48:55.809 --> 48:57.185
Please don't let go of me.

48:57.352 --> 48:59.104
Might be difficult once he kills me.

49:04.401 --> 49:08.822
Gentlemen, these two prisoners
will lead us to the Trident.

49:11.575 --> 49:13.076
Captain.

49:13.243 --> 49:15.203
Do you really think
we can find the Trident?

49:15.370 --> 49:16.663
Master Gibbs, you old worrywart,

49:16.830 --> 49:19.291
there's nothing to be
concerned about at all.

49:22.127 --> 49:23.962
What could possibly go wrong, eh?

49:25.047 --> 49:26.048
So this was your plan?

49:26.131 --> 49:28.050
To be tortured and killed by pirates.

49:28.216 --> 49:29.255
You said you needed a ship.

49:29.343 --> 49:30.151
You call this a ship?

49:30.218 --> 49:31.053
Cut the shard!

49:40.228 --> 49:41.563
Prepare to drown!

49:58.497 --> 50:01.249
Me dear beloved crew, finally, today is...

50:12.886 --> 50:14.054
Something's gone wrong.

50:33.532 --> 50:34.408
She floats!

50:38.995 --> 50:40.831
Ship dead ahead!

50:48.422 --> 50:49.297
Sir.

50:50.966 --> 50:55.053
We would never question
your reason as a captain but...

50:55.220 --> 50:58.140
But is there a reason...

50:58.306 --> 51:00.016
as captain, you've chosen to sail

51:00.142 --> 51:01.810
in this unreasonable direction?

51:02.352 --> 51:04.479
Tell the men to prepare to be boarded...

51:04.646 --> 51:07.774
to stand their ground and show no fear.

51:13.363 --> 51:16.867
«Capitán», a ship sails toward us.

51:42.601 --> 51:43.977
«Capitán» Salazar...

51:44.144 --> 51:46.438
I hear you be looking for Jack Sparrow.

52:10.086 --> 52:11.755
Hold point!

52:14.591 --> 52:16.676
And await orders.

52:37.030 --> 52:39.282
My name is Captain Barbossa,

52:39.366 --> 52:42.160
and I stand before you
with cordial intent.

52:42.744 --> 52:43.954
Cordial intent.

52:44.412 --> 52:45.664
Do you hear that?

52:45.747 --> 52:48.166
This pirate wishes to be cordial.

52:48.333 --> 52:51.962
So let me show you what my cordiality is,
«hombre». [Man]

52:52.379 --> 52:56.299
Every time I tap my sword,
one of your men will die.

52:56.466 --> 52:58.051
So I suggest that you speak quickly.

53:02.556 --> 53:04.391
Might want to go a bit faster, «Capitán».

53:08.520 --> 53:10.021
Where's Jack Sparrow?

53:10.188 --> 53:12.691
Jack be sailing for the Trident.

53:12.858 --> 53:14.192
No, the sea belongs to the dead.

53:14.359 --> 53:16.069
The Trident controls the sea.

53:16.236 --> 53:17.696
No! No!

53:17.863 --> 53:19.990
There's no treasure.

53:20.156 --> 53:22.534
There's no treasure that can save him.

53:22.617 --> 53:23.910
He will die, as will you.

53:24.077 --> 53:26.162
I be the only one
that can lead you to him.

53:27.831 --> 53:29.666
I declare you shall have Jack's life

53:29.749 --> 53:31.042
by sunrise on the morrow...

53:31.209 --> 53:32.836
or you can take me own then.

53:33.003 --> 53:34.504
Do we have an accord?

53:41.636 --> 53:42.929
Take me to him,

53:43.013 --> 53:45.015
and you will live to tell the tale.

53:45.432 --> 53:47.392
You have my word.

53:47.559 --> 53:51.021
I thank ye on behalf of me crew.

53:54.691 --> 53:57.444
Well, hey, you can take
what's left of them.

53:57.777 --> 54:00.071
The living come aboard!

54:01.448 --> 54:02.991
Right, gentlemen.

54:08.246 --> 54:10.373
Carina, we haven't got much time.

54:10.457 --> 54:11.881
The dead are sailing straight for us.

54:12.042 --> 54:12.876
Is that so?

54:13.043 --> 54:14.044
Yes, I've spoken to them.

54:14.210 --> 54:15.295
You've spoken to them?

54:15.462 --> 54:17.714
Have you spoken to krakens
and mermaids as well?

54:17.781 --> 54:19.433
Krakens don't speak. Everyone knows that.

54:19.466 --> 54:22.260
Of course. I never should have saved you.

54:22.327 --> 54:23.729
Last night, there was a blood moon,

54:23.762 --> 54:25.180
just as you described.

54:25.347 --> 54:26.348
Tell me what it revealed.

54:26.514 --> 54:27.557
And why should I trust you?

54:28.266 --> 54:30.018
You trusted me
to hold your port, remember?

54:30.185 --> 54:32.896
It was my stern. Clearly, you need to
spend more time at sea.

54:33.063 --> 54:34.940
Tell me what you found
and I promise to help you.

54:35.106 --> 54:35.953
I don't need any help.

54:36.107 --> 54:38.234
Then why did you come to me, Carina?

54:38.301 --> 54:40.220
Why are we tied together
in the middle of the sea,

54:40.230 --> 54:42.024
chasing the same treasure?

54:44.449 --> 54:46.368
The moon revealed a clue.

54:46.534 --> 54:50.330
"To release the power
of the sea, all must divide."

54:51.456 --> 54:53.541
Divide? What does it mean?

54:54.876 --> 54:56.544
I'm not sure yet.

54:58.088 --> 54:59.255
Then we'll find out.

55:01.341 --> 55:02.926
There is no map in this map.

55:03.218 --> 55:04.719
Give me my diary.

55:06.262 --> 55:07.973
Give me «The Map No Man Can Read».

55:08.139 --> 55:09.015
If you could read it,

55:09.020 --> 55:11.088
then it wouldn't be called
«The Map No Man Can Read».

55:11.100 --> 55:12.827
I beg you, please, don't argue with her.

55:12.894 --> 55:15.397
Most of the men on this ship can't read.

55:15.563 --> 55:19.526
Which makes all maps
«The Maps That No Man Can Read».

55:19.693 --> 55:22.779
Well, if you can't read it,
then you have no use for it or me.

55:23.571 --> 55:24.906
Let me start again.

55:25.407 --> 55:27.325
Show me the map.

55:27.492 --> 55:30.036
I can't. It doesn't yet exist.

55:30.203 --> 55:31.037
She's a witch!

55:31.663 --> 55:32.747
I'm an astronomer.

55:33.039 --> 55:35.625
Ah! Ah, she breeds donkeys.

55:36.209 --> 55:39.796
What? No. An astronomer
contemplates the sky.

55:39.963 --> 55:42.716
- Yeah, on a donkey?
- No! There's no donkey!

55:42.882 --> 55:44.592
Well, then how do you breed them?

55:45.135 --> 55:47.887
Allow me to simplify this equation.

55:48.054 --> 55:49.723
Give me the map...

55:50.932 --> 55:52.934
or I will kill...

55:54.436 --> 55:55.979
him. I'll kill him.

55:58.732 --> 56:00.358
Go on then.

56:00.525 --> 56:01.651
You're bluffing.

56:02.902 --> 56:04.571
And you're blushing.

56:06.239 --> 56:07.532
Throw him over.

56:08.033 --> 56:08.908
Come. Come on.

56:09.325 --> 56:10.441
- Come on.
- Come on. Come on.

56:12.078 --> 56:13.872
We call this keelhauling.

56:14.998 --> 56:17.500
Young Henry will be tossed over...

56:18.877 --> 56:21.171
and he will be dragged under the ship.

56:21.337 --> 56:24.049
All right. What're you waiting for?

56:24.215 --> 56:25.467
Uh, he doesn't appear to be...

56:25.633 --> 56:27.677
- Zip, zip.
- Nope, not bluffing, me.

56:28.136 --> 56:29.429
He's trying to say something.

56:30.138 --> 56:32.223
No, no, we don't have
any food aboard. Sorry.

56:33.391 --> 56:36.144
If he's lucky, he'll drown
before the barnacles

56:36.227 --> 56:37.395
shred him to ribbons.

56:37.562 --> 56:38.396
Barnacles?

56:38.563 --> 56:40.940
Like a thousand knives across your back.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.068
'Course the blood attracts sharks.

56:43.234 --> 56:44.034
Sharks?

56:44.527 --> 56:45.327
Shark off the bow!

56:46.404 --> 56:50.116
I would say that swimming is
no longer his primary concern.

56:50.283 --> 56:51.284
The map is there!

56:51.826 --> 56:52.660
Where?

56:52.827 --> 56:53.827
On the tip of your finger?

56:53.953 --> 56:56.331
No. In the heavens.

56:56.498 --> 56:59.375
That diary will lead me
to a map hidden in the stars.

56:59.542 --> 57:02.170
Let him up. I'll find it tonight.

57:02.337 --> 57:05.256
Sorry, can't bring him up.
Look for yourself.

57:08.551 --> 57:11.346
As I said... blushing.

57:17.435 --> 57:19.187
Filthy pirate.

57:23.441 --> 57:25.235
The sea has turned to blood.

57:25.568 --> 57:28.655
A sailor washed ashore
talking about the Trident.

57:28.822 --> 57:30.448
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.

57:30.615 --> 57:33.535
The same pirate who saved
a witch from the gallows.

57:33.701 --> 57:35.328
She's no witch.

57:35.703 --> 57:37.497
But you are.

57:38.039 --> 57:39.833
And you're going to help us.

57:39.999 --> 57:41.960
You're afraid, Lieutenant.

57:43.211 --> 57:44.504
As ships burn in the night,

57:44.587 --> 57:46.965
you want to know if you can save your own.

57:47.715 --> 57:50.927
If the Trident is real.

57:51.094 --> 57:54.806
You're going to read that wall
for me or you will die.

57:54.973 --> 57:58.560
The British Empire will have
the Trident and rule the sea.

57:58.726 --> 58:00.770
I want to know where that pirate is going

58:00.854 --> 58:02.230
with that witch.

58:02.939 --> 58:05.483
Your destiny is in these stars.

58:05.650 --> 58:08.111
I will set your course.

58:33.344 --> 58:35.471
Spaghetti wolf!

58:35.638 --> 58:37.807
Why did I bother coming to you?

58:37.974 --> 58:40.101
The dead are hunting us down
and you do nothing.

58:40.268 --> 58:41.978
Nothing! You call this nothing?

58:42.145 --> 58:43.563
You're drunk! And you're sleeping.

58:43.730 --> 58:47.400
My point exactly!
I am doing two things at once.

58:47.817 --> 58:50.486
You can't save the unsaveable, mate.

58:51.738 --> 58:53.469
Like it or not, Jack,
you're going to help me.

58:53.615 --> 58:55.241
I will break my father's curse.

58:58.286 --> 59:03.750
Next time you raise a sword,
boy, be the last to die.

59:15.929 --> 59:17.222
Oh.

59:19.599 --> 59:23.394
Might I suggest you entice her
with a bit of flattery?

59:24.812 --> 59:26.689
I'm here for my father, nothing more.

59:26.856 --> 59:30.944
I knew it. Absolutely smitten with her.

59:31.110 --> 59:34.197
Now, a bit of discretion
when courting a brunette...

59:34.364 --> 59:36.199
never pursue her sister.

59:36.366 --> 59:40.203
But if you cannot avoid
the charm of her sister...

59:40.370 --> 59:41.496
kill the brother.

59:41.663 --> 59:42.789
Savvy?

59:44.374 --> 59:46.251
No, I do not savvy.

59:47.919 --> 59:49.545
Who hurt you?

59:49.712 --> 59:52.507
By the way, that little
sliver of knowledge

59:52.590 --> 59:54.425
will cost you five pieces.

59:54.592 --> 59:55.669
I'm not paying you for that.

59:56.177 --> 59:58.513
Never say that to a woman.

01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:14.904
Just because you can't see something,

01:00:14.988 --> 01:00:16.281
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.658
Like the map?

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:22.161
I have to find it.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.999
It's the only link to who I am.

01:00:26.082 --> 01:00:27.500
Who my father was.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:32.255
So we've both spent our lives
searching for our fathers.

01:00:33.298 --> 01:00:35.383
Perhaps you and I
are closer than you think.

01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:54.694
The sun is up, and so is your time.

01:00:57.447 --> 01:00:58.448
Not to disagree,

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:01.284
but the precision
of our accord ends at sunrise.

01:01:01.451 --> 01:01:04.245
This be but first light,
far from a fully risin' sun.

01:01:04.412 --> 01:01:05.997
And I know you to be a man of honour.

01:01:06.164 --> 01:01:08.082
Honour? You know nothing of me.

01:01:08.249 --> 01:01:10.501
I know what it's like to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.003
He's an enemy to us...

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:14.005
You don't know who I am.

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:18.551
I've heard stories
of a mighty Spanish captain,

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.386
«El Matador Del Mar».
[The killer of the sea]

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.221
A man who scourged the sea,

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.307
hunted and killed thousands of men.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:27.393
No, no, no. Men, no. No, no, no.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.103
Pirates, eh?

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.775
Pirates.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:41.616
"Pirates had infected the seas
for generations."

01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:45.244
"Taking the life of my father
and his father before."

01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.956
"So I vowed to end this plague
once and for all."

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:51.959
And that is what I did.
I destroyed dozens of ships.

01:01:58.174 --> 01:02:02.512
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat me!

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.598
But they soon realised it was hopeless.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:20.029
"Nothing could stop the «Silent Mary»."

01:02:21.206 --> 01:02:22.415
Hit them below the water line.

01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:23.549
«Vamos»! «Vamos»!"
[Come on]

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:29.122
Hang on, boys!

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:42.051
The sea was finally pure.

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:45.346
"Their wretched flags
would no longer stain the sea."

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:56.482
They are begging for mercy.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:00.528
Mercy? Mercy?

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:02.905
There's no mercy.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:10.663
"Make ready!"

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.081
"Please, help us!"

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:17.712
«Adiós»!
[Bye]

01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:18.971
Fire!

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:30.641
It's up to you now, Jack.

01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:36.606
This compass points towards
what you want most.

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.861
Never betray it.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:15.811
The Devil's Triangle.

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:18.606
"The last of their ships"

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.775
"were burning in front of my eyes."

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:26.781
And in that moment of victory...

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:28.908
it's when I heard it.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.787
"Hey! Hold on, «Capitán»."

01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.080
"One ship"

01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:35.957
"was trying to escape through the smoke."

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.960
It's a lovely day for a sail, innit?
[isn't it.]

01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:41.671
And there, in the crow's nest...

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:45.716
"there was this young pirate boy."

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:46.759
"The way I see it,"

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.173
"there's just the two of us left."

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:51.138
"You surrender to me now
and I'll let you live. Simple."

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:55.017
He stood there looking like
a little bird, eh?

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:56.269
And from that day...

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:58.980
he earned himself a name
that would haunt me

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:00.606
for the rest of my days...

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.277
Jack the Sparrow.

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:08.030
"Right then. You surrender
to me now and I let you live."

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.534
"I shall let you live."

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:22.920
This boy was mocking my power,
so I chased him...

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:26.549
knowing that I would
run my knife along his neck...

01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:27.967
and when he was dead,

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:31.345
I would finish finally
with the pirate's life.

01:05:36.225 --> 01:05:37.268
Follow him in.

01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:41.856
"To the gallows. Grab some lines."

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:46.068
Prepare the bootleg. Portside.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:49.905
Throw it now.

01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.220
Bootleg turn.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.959
What's all this?

01:07:27.795 --> 01:07:30.423
Tribute, sir.

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:43.310
Ooh!

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.413
"He took everything from me..."

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.833
"and filled me with rage."

01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:10.129
And pain.

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:15.468
And here is where the tale ends.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.345
Not yet, «Capitán». There!

01:08:19.555 --> 01:08:21.557
Found as promised.

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:47.416
So she's saying she's got the map,

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.077
but she's the only one who can follow it?

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.544
So we should shoot her?

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:52.837
Leave her be. She will
take us to the Trident.

01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:54.313
You've been saying that for hours.

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:56.008
Two things we know are true, eh?

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.635
- Yeah.
- Stars don't shine by day.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.470
And she forgot the donkey.

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:04.475
How can we go to a spot where
no land exists on any map?

01:09:05.643 --> 01:09:08.354
This chronometer keeps
the exact time in London.

01:09:08.813 --> 01:09:10.689
I'm using it to make
an altitude measurement

01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:12.316
to determine longitude.

01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:15.027
Only then will we find
our exact spot at sea.

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.738
So you expect to find
the Trident with a timepiece?

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.113
Yes.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:21.826
My calculations are precise and true.

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:24.620
I'm not only an astronomer,
I'm also a horologist.

01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:26.162
Mmm.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:31.669
No shame in that, dear.

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.755
I mean, we all have to earn a living, eh?

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.173
Oh, yeah.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:39.510
No. No, I'm a horologist.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.011
So was my mum.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:42.832
But she didn't crow about it
as loud as you.

01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:45.182
Are you saying your mother
was academically inclined?

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.520
More like, horizontally reclined.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:52.939
Horology is the study of time.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.359
And she was always looking at her watch.

01:09:55.526 --> 01:09:56.902
I can vouch for that.

01:09:58.571 --> 01:10:02.408
So no one can find the «X» but you, right?

01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:03.701
- No.
- And the donkey?

01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:05.703
Ship to the aft!

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:08.706
Salazar.

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:15.546
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.

01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:16.964
Dead?

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:19.049
No, no. The dead were never
part of this deal.

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.634
We should have never followed

01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:22.177
a luckless pirate and a witch to sea.

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:24.597
Right, that's it. Kill 'em all.

01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:28.893
Kill me and I'll be dead.

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.436
And then the other dead

01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:32.938
won't be able to have their revenge...

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.732
against me.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:36.525
Being dead.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:37.526
What?

01:10:37.593 --> 01:10:39.345
Which will anger them
even more. He's right.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.267
That's right.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:41.614
Are all pirates this stupid?

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.580
Yes.

01:10:42.698 --> 01:10:43.574
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:45.618
What are we going to do?

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:50.581
As Captain, might I suggest...

01:10:55.044 --> 01:10:57.129
Mutiny? You had to suggest a mutiny?

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.589
Carina, the dead are coming.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:01.967
Well, I choose not to believe
in supernatural nonsense.

01:11:02.134 --> 01:11:03.719
Do you not see what's behind us?

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:20.653
Drop them. Drop them.

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:28.911
What are you doing?

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:30.663
The men on that ship are looking for Jack

01:11:30.788 --> 01:11:31.750
and Jack is on this boat.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.907
So I'm going to swim for it.

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:36.251
How dare you do exactly
what I would do if I were you.

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.879
- Carina, stop that.
- No, no, no. Don't stop that.

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:40.172
This has gone far enough.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.799
No, it has not.

01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:45.177
Listen not to him. Carry on. Carry on.

01:11:50.891 --> 01:11:53.185
Why? She was almost finished.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.520
I saw her ankles.

01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:55.604
You'd have seen a lot more

01:11:55.688 --> 01:11:57.188
if you'd have kept your cake hole shut.

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:17.376
"Kill the Sparrow."

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:35.978
Oh, that's not good, is it?

01:12:36.145 --> 01:12:39.148
Keep rowing, man. Faster. Faster.

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.400
No. That's it.

01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:44.194
I'm going with her.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.114
You would leave me for
some horologist in her knickers?

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.115
Yes.

01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:51.660
You men are all alike.

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.172
Shark.

01:13:27.988 --> 01:13:28.947
Henry!

01:13:51.637 --> 01:13:52.888
Doesn't seem to be working!

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.932
No, we'll be fine. We'll be fine.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.065
«Vamos»!"

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.994
How do they do that?

01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:18.247
We have to swim for it.
I'll distract them.

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.838
Now!

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.191
Oh, shoo!

01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:50.988
Go away!

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.796
Henry!

01:15:57.763 --> 01:15:58.847
Oh!

01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:02.017
Hi, Jack Sparrow.

01:16:03.477 --> 01:16:04.937
Jack the Sparrow.

01:16:05.437 --> 01:16:07.272
You're Spanish?

01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:14.738
You're ghosts!

01:16:14.947 --> 01:16:16.114
Oh.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:18.200
They're unable to step on land.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:20.035
I knew that, though.

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:21.286
Ghosts!

01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:25.874
Carina!

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:28.377
You will soon pay for what you did to me.

01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:30.671
No, no, no. There's
no need to bother, really.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:32.222
- Carina!
- I have no time to chat...

01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:33.882
because me map's just run away.

01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:35.968
I will be waiting for you!

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.387
Why would you be waiting for me?

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:39.805
Why would he be waiting for me?

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.739
Pirates!

01:17:12.713 --> 01:17:13.880
Scrum.

01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:15.257
Captain.

01:17:15.424 --> 01:17:16.425
Jack always told me that

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.065
if anything should ever happen to him...

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.518
he wanted you to be captain.

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:21.430
Yeah, but the men voted for you.

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:22.889
That's why you got a captain's hat.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:24.182
Be that as it may...

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:25.434
them were his wishes,

01:17:25.517 --> 01:17:27.227
so be a good lad and take the wheel.

01:17:27.394 --> 01:17:28.854
And, uh, you...

01:17:30.022 --> 01:17:31.440
take the captain's hat.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.108
Oh.

01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:34.576
This is the proudest moment of my...

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:40.032
We will beat your captain to death...

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.034
until he reveals where they're heading.

01:17:44.536 --> 01:17:45.537
Carina!

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.706
I know what's ailing you, boy.

01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:50.500
You've got the unscratchable itch.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:51.710
Carina is the only one

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.122
who can help us find the Trident...

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:54.546
and I'm not in love with her.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:55.756
Love?

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.920
Who said anything about love?
What are you talking about?

01:17:57.930 --> 01:17:59.149
The unscratchable itch?

01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:00.969
Scabies. I'm talking about scabies.

01:18:01.136 --> 01:18:03.305
Small mites that burrow under the skin.

01:18:03.472 --> 01:18:05.307
It's certainly ailing me,
has been for years.

01:18:05.474 --> 01:18:07.017
Oh, no.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:10.236
Help!

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:12.898
Help me!

01:18:13.065 --> 01:18:14.232
- Carina!
- Help!

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:17.444
- Henry, help me!
- Help her!

01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:20.530
"By rule of the King,"

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:22.449
"I sentence you all to death!"

01:18:23.909 --> 01:18:26.244
I think we should tell each other

01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:27.913
where our treasures are buried...

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.082
just in case one of us survives.

01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:32.000
Oh, good idea.

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:33.752
You go first.

01:18:33.919 --> 01:18:36.505
My treasure is buried between
two crossed palm trees...

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:40.133
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.
What about yours?

01:18:41.093 --> 01:18:42.469
I haven't got any.

01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:44.471
You promised me Jack's blood!

01:18:44.638 --> 01:18:46.306
But Jack be trapped!

01:18:46.473 --> 01:18:48.266
He can never escape that island.

01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:49.684
He's on land!

01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:56.525
Hello.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:04.950
I upheld our deal. Me men
and meself will go ashore.

01:19:05.117 --> 01:19:06.701
The scurvy traitor will be yours...

01:19:07.119 --> 01:19:08.453
on me honour.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.957
Honour? What honour, «hombre»?
What honour?

01:19:12.124 --> 01:19:13.291
You don't know what honour is.

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.419
Spare me my life,

01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:17.170
and I'll fetch you the Sparrow.

01:19:19.673 --> 01:19:21.299
An accord?

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:38.650
Wake up, Sparrow.

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:45.115
Wake up, Sparrow.

01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:50.829
Wake up, Sparrow.
It's time to pay your debt.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:55.041
Pig... Pig Kelly?

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:57.502
Me old mate.

01:19:57.669 --> 01:20:01.173
Mate? You hear that, boys?

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:04.593
This lyin' pirate owes me
a plunder of silver...

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:07.387
and luck has brought him
to Hangman's Bay...

01:20:07.554 --> 01:20:10.682
where he can settle his debt here and now.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.435
Oh, and I will. I will, Pig.

01:20:13.602 --> 01:20:14.686
Name your price.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.939
Her name is Beatrice...

01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:22.777
and she's my poor, widowed sister.

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:27.240
What is that?

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:29.743
She's been looking for a respectable man.

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:31.411
But you'll have to do.

01:20:31.578 --> 01:20:32.732
Louis, let's get on with this.

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:34.706
No! Why? Why would we do that?

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:36.708
To make an honest woman of her, Jack.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:39.920
Congratulations. It's your wedding day.

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:42.547
Let us begin.

01:20:42.714 --> 01:20:44.883
We'll honeymoon in the barn.

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:50.430
No, no, no.

01:20:51.056 --> 01:20:52.641
Now, Pig, how could I...

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:54.893
honestly make an honest woman out of it?

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.270
That... Her. I mean, her.

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:02.108
What are those things?

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:03.777
Our children.

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:06.321
Best not look them in the eye.

01:21:06.488 --> 01:21:08.448
Bring the best man and the bridesmaid.

01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:11.243
I looked it in the eye.

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:13.495
Place your hand on the Bible.

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:15.413
I've got scabies.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.082
- So do I.
- Ugh!

01:21:17.457 --> 01:21:19.960
Place your hand on the Bible.

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:21.836
I'm a bed-wetter.

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:23.505
Say «I do...»

01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:26.091
or I'll put a bullet in your skull.

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:27.467
Jack, they're going to kill us!

01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:29.386
- I don't care!
- Just say «I do».

01:21:29.553 --> 01:21:30.971
- Last chance, Jack.
- Wait!

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.765
Surely, this is not legal.

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:35.267
This is not legal.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:36.518
He's right.

01:21:36.685 --> 01:21:39.271
Does any man here
object to these nuptials?

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:41.856
- I do.
- Congratulations!

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:44.192
You may kiss the bride!

01:21:52.826 --> 01:21:53.827
No.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:57.998
You like seafood, do you?

01:21:58.164 --> 01:21:59.291
Come on!

01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:05.463
Jack, we meet again.

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:07.465
Hector!

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:10.051
This is me bestest mate
in the whole world.

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:12.804
I always knew
you'd settle down eventually.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.180
Did you bring me a gift?

01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:17.642
That'll do.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.063
You look marvelous.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:23.815
Got quite the spring in your step.

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:26.484
Has your leg grown back?

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:28.987
Uh, Captain, shouldn't we
be getting back to Salazar...

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:31.656
trade Mr Sparrow's life in for our own?

01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:33.158
Aye, that we could...

01:22:33.325 --> 01:22:35.827
but I've come for the Trident of Poseidon.

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:38.204
You're gonna double-cross the dead?

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:39.664
You did promise.

01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:42.000
And with it, I'll gut the dead that stole

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.585
my command of the sea.

01:22:43.752 --> 01:22:45.712
As much as I love this plan...

01:22:45.879 --> 01:22:49.674
no vessel can outrun
that wretched hull of a ship.

01:22:49.841 --> 01:22:51.259
But there be one, Jack.

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:54.179
The fastest ship I know, the «Pearl»...

01:22:54.346 --> 01:22:58.350
trapped in that bottle by
Blackbeard five winters ago.

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:02.103
By the power of that

01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:03.421
blackguard's sovereign blade...

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.024
I hereby release the «Black Pearl»

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:08.485
to her former and rightful glory.

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:20.872
Get ready!

01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:23.375
Get ready for it!

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:24.675
It's coming!

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:26.419
It's coming! It's coming, it's coming!

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:34.344
Stand aside! Stand aside!

01:23:35.428 --> 01:23:36.930
It's coming!

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:54.280
It's shrunken.

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:56.908
Why doesn't it unshrink?

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.077
Maybe it's cold, huh?

01:23:59.244 --> 01:24:01.037
She needs the sea.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:17.303
She was a fine ship.

01:24:52.297 --> 01:24:54.090
Let...

01:24:55.383 --> 01:24:58.386
There be room for only one captain.

01:24:59.429 --> 01:25:00.430
Ooh!

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:01.973
Filthy beast.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.476
Time to race the dead.

01:25:10.982 --> 01:25:13.151
The only safe place is the land.

01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:16.905
Why are we going away
from the land? Anyone?

01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:19.741
Captain, your map is incomplete.

01:25:19.908 --> 01:25:22.619
I can take us to the Trident
if you'd only trust me.

01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:23.586
Anyone?

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.122
Did you not hear anything I just said?

01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:28.374
So you be saying that that star

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:29.793
is pretendin' to be a map?

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:32.462
Sir, there is no island on any map

01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:34.255
to support what the woman says.

01:25:34.422 --> 01:25:36.038
Captain, you don't have to understand her.

01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:37.842
Just believe her.

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:40.428
Anyone?

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:55.652
If we had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:59.447
You're not gonna find
anything sharp in here.

01:26:05.787 --> 01:26:08.832
Keep still, you bilge rat.

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:09.958
Captain!

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:12.544
No, please! I don't wanna
be captain any more!

01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:22.387
Release 'em!

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:27.559
Sir, you wouldn't allow...

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:29.561
a woman to steer your ship?

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:32.564
She will follow her star,
or we'll all die together.

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:55.295
The «Black Pearl»! She sails again!

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.005
Come on, lads!

01:26:58.298 --> 01:27:01.342
This ship, those ghosts...

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:03.636
There can be no logical explanation.

01:27:03.803 --> 01:27:05.972
The myths of the sea are real, Carina.

01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:07.974
I'm glad you can finally see
you were wrong.

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:09.309
Wrong?

01:27:11.352 --> 01:27:12.770
Perhaps I had some doubts.

01:27:12.937 --> 01:27:14.772
This is the worst apology I've ever heard.

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.733
Apology? Why would I apologise?

01:27:16.908 --> 01:27:18.443
Because we've been chased by the dead,

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:19.977
sailing on a ship raised from a bottle.

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.134
Where is your science in that?

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.600
Fine, then I will apologise.

01:27:24.198 --> 01:27:25.116
Go on, then.

01:27:25.183 --> 01:27:27.268
Although one could argue
that you owe me an apology...

01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:29.898
as my life has been threatened
by pirates and dead men.

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:31.831
Which you now believe in, sorry to say.

01:27:32.624 --> 01:27:34.250
Apology accepted.

01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:37.587
I'm going to the lookout.

01:27:38.004 --> 01:27:39.631
I'm glad you see it my way.

01:27:45.803 --> 01:27:47.972
"Twelve degrees to port!"

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:50.683
- Ready the guns.
- Aye!

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:51.684
Ready the guns!

01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:53.937
Those pirates are going for the Trident.

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.162
Where did you get that from, Missy?

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:12.163
I know this book.

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:15.500
Stolen from an Italian ship
many years ago.

01:28:15.833 --> 01:28:18.836
Stolen? No, you're mistaken.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:23.007
There was a ruby on the cover
I would not soon forget.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:27.345
This was given to me by my father...

01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:29.681
who was clearly a man of science.

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.726
He was clearly a common thief.

01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:37.355
The memory of my father
will not be defiled

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:39.190
by the tongue of a pirate.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.067
This diary is my birthright.

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:44.195
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.780
Along with a name and nothing else.

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.741
Oh, so you're an orphan.

01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:50.702
What be you called?

01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:55.707
Brightest star in the North
gave me my name.

01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:04.298
That would be Carina.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:05.550
Carina Smyth.

01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:09.137
So you do know your stars.

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:11.723
I'm a captain.

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:17.979
I know which stars to follow home.

01:30:00.938 --> 01:30:02.106
Smyth.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:05.193
Smyth is quite an unusual name.

01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:08.112
Did we not once...

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:09.947
know someone called Smyth?

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:11.699
Shut your trap.

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:13.367
What was her name?

01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:16.245
It's right on the tip of me tongue. Oh!

01:30:16.454 --> 01:30:17.622
Do you wanna lose that tongue?

01:30:17.789 --> 01:30:19.165
Margaret Smyth.

01:30:19.999 --> 01:30:21.042
Aye.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:23.002
Should we make an accord then?

01:30:23.169 --> 01:30:27.673
Or shall I tell you-know-who
what we both know to be true?

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.468
We both take this secret to our graves.

01:30:30.635 --> 01:30:32.303
You mean, it is true? I was bluffing.

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.387
I'm not.

01:30:33.554 --> 01:30:36.849
You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.

01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:39.310
So you need me.

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:42.146
I'll have to be frank, Hector.

01:30:42.313 --> 01:30:44.357
You are very, very ugly.

01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:46.317
So how could you produce

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:49.403
a fetching creature such as that?

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.239
Margaret died.

01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:52.698
I summoned as much honour

01:30:52.782 --> 01:30:54.742
as a worthless blaggard ever could.

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:56.828
I placed the infant in an orphanage...

01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:58.371
never to see her again.

01:30:58.538 --> 01:31:00.248
I thought the ruby might afford her

01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.499
some ease in life...

01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:04.460
but I never imagined
she'd take those scribblings...

01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:06.170
and make a life of her own.

01:31:07.255 --> 01:31:09.340
A life that's led her back to me.

01:31:12.009 --> 01:31:13.678
I'd say this puts me

01:31:13.761 --> 01:31:16.681
in a rather favorable position, Daddy.

01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:18.349
You tell me what you want.

01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:20.351
I want me compass.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:23.729
216 barrels of rum.

01:31:25.022 --> 01:31:26.440
And the monkey.

01:31:26.607 --> 01:31:27.692
You want Jack?

01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:30.361
Dinner. I want to eat him,
I want to eat that monkey...

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:32.446
No deal, Jack.

01:31:32.613 --> 01:31:35.074
A clever young woman such
as that would never believe...

01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:38.911
that a swine like me
could ever be her blood.

01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:43.541
And the Trident will be mine.

01:31:54.719 --> 01:31:56.053
Redcoats!

01:31:57.054 --> 01:31:58.764
Redcoats!

01:32:01.392 --> 01:32:03.144
Prepare to fire!

01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:05.479
Prepare to fire!

01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:07.440
Man that gun!

01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:14.155
She comes starboard.

01:32:14.822 --> 01:32:16.908
We shall fight to the last.

01:32:17.116 --> 01:32:20.077
The «Pearl» will not be taken from me
again.

01:32:25.082 --> 01:32:26.250
Sir.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.965
Only the British Empire

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.842
will hold to the power of the sea.

01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:12.463
Whatever happens, stay your course.

01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:39.991
Jack Sparrow!

01:33:41.117 --> 01:33:43.077
Jack Sparrow.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.538
I've come with a butcher's bill.

01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:51.043
Where is he?

01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:57.258
Defend yourselves, men. To the death!

01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:01.762
Hurry up, man.

01:34:01.846 --> 01:34:03.347
What did you sharpen it with? Butter?

01:34:23.993 --> 01:34:26.162
There's nowhere to hide.

01:34:42.219 --> 01:34:45.306
Let's be brave. Save the «Pearl»!

01:34:53.898 --> 01:34:55.232
This has to be it.

01:34:58.194 --> 01:34:59.195
It has to be here.

01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.072
Find that land.

01:35:01.238 --> 01:35:02.406
Or we'll all die.

01:35:03.282 --> 01:35:04.575
We're nearly there!

01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:07.578
It's here somewhere.

01:35:24.762 --> 01:35:25.596
Oh!

01:35:42.279 --> 01:35:43.364
Ow.

01:36:02.508 --> 01:36:03.509
Ha!

01:36:15.396 --> 01:36:16.397
Whoa...

01:36:28.409 --> 01:36:30.327
Have you found what you're
looking for yet, miss?

01:36:30.494 --> 01:36:32.163
I'm trying!

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:37.585
The stars will soon be gone.

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:54.393
Whoa! Whoa!

01:37:07.531 --> 01:37:08.365
Carina!

01:37:09.283 --> 01:37:11.118
Henry, look!

01:37:11.285 --> 01:37:12.703
The island is there.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.121
You found it!

01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.217
The island.

01:37:32.223 --> 01:37:33.265
Land.

01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:36.227
Get to the «Mary»!

01:37:52.243 --> 01:37:53.410
Carina!

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.095
Carina!

01:38:14.139 --> 01:38:15.224
Henry!

01:38:28.946 --> 01:38:29.989
They took Henry!

01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:32.866
The Trident be all that can save him now.

01:38:33.033 --> 01:38:34.285
Then we have to find it.

01:38:54.555 --> 01:38:55.806
Where is it?

01:39:00.144 --> 01:39:01.895
It has to be here.

01:39:33.677 --> 01:39:35.095
Look at it, Jack.

01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:38.515
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:39:38.682 --> 01:39:40.893
This is what my father wanted me to find.

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.860
The rocks?

01:39:42.019 --> 01:39:43.520
No, not rocks.

01:39:43.937 --> 01:39:45.272
Stars.

01:39:45.939 --> 01:39:48.067
This is «The Map No Man Can Read».

01:39:49.234 --> 01:39:53.364
This island is a perfect reflection
of the heavens.

01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:01.955
One star's missing.

01:40:02.539 --> 01:40:03.374
Quickly!

01:40:04.458 --> 01:40:06.543
We have to find the Trident to save Henry.

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:08.712
Hector, I think you should know,

01:40:08.796 --> 01:40:10.714
she's a horologist.

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:39.618
Why isn't it glowing?

01:40:41.286 --> 01:40:43.080
Finish it, Carina.

01:40:49.336 --> 01:40:51.922
The missing star.

01:40:52.506 --> 01:40:53.799
For my father.

01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.176
Aye.

01:40:57.594 --> 01:40:59.304
Do it for him.

01:42:29.978 --> 01:42:30.813
Look.

01:42:31.897 --> 01:42:34.024
Poseidon's tomb.

01:42:34.316 --> 01:42:35.818
This way.

01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.280
«Capitán», you know the danger.

01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:41.365
Don't do it.

01:42:41.532 --> 01:42:42.407
He has no choice.

01:42:42.574 --> 01:42:44.326
Jack is on land going for the Trident.

01:42:44.493 --> 01:42:45.940
«Capitán», there must be another way.

01:42:45.994 --> 01:42:48.372
Once you possess the living,
there's no coming back.

01:42:48.539 --> 01:42:50.999
You will be trapped in his body forever.

01:42:51.166 --> 01:42:53.168
The Trident will set me free.

01:42:55.838 --> 01:42:57.881
Time to kill a Sparrow.

01:42:58.048 --> 01:42:58.882
No!

01:43:12.563 --> 01:43:14.398
Look, Jack. There it is.

01:43:14.565 --> 01:43:16.692
The Trident.

01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:24.241
- Jack!
- Huh?

01:43:58.692 --> 01:44:00.611
Huh?

01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:04.156
You cut me, you cut the boy, Jack.

01:44:39.983 --> 01:44:41.026
Henry!

01:45:13.809 --> 01:45:15.978
«Hola», Sparrow.
[Hello]

01:45:16.895 --> 01:45:18.063
Oh, no.

01:45:29.658 --> 01:45:32.369
I hate the Sparrow. Die, Sparrow.

01:45:39.584 --> 01:45:40.419
Henry!

01:45:41.003 --> 01:45:43.630
He's walking on land. Please.

01:45:43.797 --> 01:45:45.507
Henry, wake up.

01:45:46.591 --> 01:45:48.051
Oh, piss off!

01:45:51.763 --> 01:45:53.306
Whoa!

01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.730
Henry, wake up. He's killing Jack.

01:46:10.824 --> 01:46:11.825
Henry!

01:46:12.409 --> 01:46:13.368
Power of the sea.

01:46:13.535 --> 01:46:14.335
What?

01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:16.038
The power of the sea.

01:46:16.872 --> 01:46:18.290
"To release the power of the sea..."

01:46:18.457 --> 01:46:19.750
"all must divide."

01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:28.258
If the Trident
holds all the power, then...

01:46:28.425 --> 01:46:30.218
Then every curse is held inside.

01:46:30.552 --> 01:46:33.472
As I told you before...

01:46:33.638 --> 01:46:36.433
surrender to me now and I'll let you...

01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:38.393
live.

01:46:38.769 --> 01:46:40.103
You want me to surrender?

01:46:42.439 --> 01:46:43.523
Maybe.

01:46:43.899 --> 01:46:45.192
This is where the tale ends.

01:46:47.986 --> 01:46:48.820
No!

01:46:52.324 --> 01:46:53.450
Shh.

01:47:02.292 --> 01:47:03.092
Divide.

01:47:03.627 --> 01:47:04.461
Henry!

01:47:07.631 --> 01:47:08.799
Divide. Break.

01:47:08.965 --> 01:47:10.158
Break the Trident and you'll...

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.262
Break every curse at sea.

01:47:59.599 --> 01:48:01.393
All curses are broken.

01:48:21.872 --> 01:48:24.291
We are flesh and blood!

01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:42.100
The «Pearl»!

01:48:42.434 --> 01:48:43.393
My «Pearl»!

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.603
Climb!

01:48:44.769 --> 01:48:47.230
Move! Fast!

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.902
Hold it steady, boys!

01:48:52.068 --> 01:48:53.361
Don't let her slip!

01:48:58.491 --> 01:48:59.659
Jack!

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.787
Jump!

01:49:02.954 --> 01:49:04.247
Faster!

01:49:17.219 --> 01:49:19.679
Up! Anchor!

01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:21.139
Get the anchor up! Quick!

01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:23.016
Stop! Stop! Bring it up!

01:49:23.183 --> 01:49:25.185
Bring it up! Bring it up! Come on!

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:31.441
Bring it up!

01:49:42.369 --> 01:49:44.162
«Capitán»!"

01:49:44.579 --> 01:49:46.039
«Capitán»!"

01:50:10.397 --> 01:50:11.856
Oh, crumbs!

01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:20.615
Whoa. Whoa.

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:31.501
Oh!

01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:34.838
I've got you!

01:50:38.133 --> 01:50:39.134
Stronger.

01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:58.528
Who am I to you?

01:51:01.239 --> 01:51:02.574
Treasure.

01:51:13.877 --> 01:51:14.919
Hold on!

01:51:18.214 --> 01:51:19.549
Hector!

01:52:35.041 --> 01:52:37.001
Hold her starboard!

01:53:02.485 --> 01:53:05.238
Pirate's life, Hector.

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:42.233
You all right?

01:53:43.359 --> 01:53:44.777
I don't know.

01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:47.780
For a moment, I had everything, Henry.

01:53:49.574 --> 01:53:51.367
Now, it's all gone again.

01:53:51.534 --> 01:53:53.953
It's not all gone, Ms Smyth.

01:54:07.425 --> 01:54:08.760
Barbossa.

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.930
My name is Barbossa.

01:54:53.972 --> 01:54:55.932
Maybe Jack was right.

01:54:56.099 --> 01:54:57.809
About what?

01:54:57.976 --> 01:54:59.310
The unscratchable itch.

01:55:03.231 --> 01:55:04.482
What did you do that for?

01:55:04.649 --> 01:55:06.442
Just checking it's truly you.

01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:08.152
That you're not still a ghost.

01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:10.113
It's me.

01:55:10.488 --> 01:55:11.614
Then I was...

01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:12.782
Wrong.

01:55:12.949 --> 01:55:14.909
Slightly in error. Although...

01:55:22.292 --> 01:55:23.835
Apology accepted.

01:55:37.432 --> 01:55:38.641
The «Dutchman».

01:56:14.302 --> 01:56:15.303
Henry.

01:56:16.387 --> 01:56:17.472
Yes, Father.

01:56:26.522 --> 01:56:28.358
Let me look at you, son.

01:56:32.737 --> 01:56:34.072
How did you do it?

01:56:36.032 --> 01:56:37.325
How did you break the curse?

01:56:37.492 --> 01:56:39.160
Let me tell you a tale.

01:56:39.535 --> 01:56:41.829
A tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.

01:56:41.996 --> 01:56:43.998
That's a tale I wanna hear.

01:57:42.598 --> 01:57:44.434
What a truly revolting sight.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.560
Make way!

01:57:46.102 --> 01:57:47.937
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck!

01:57:48.604 --> 01:57:49.605
Indeed!

01:57:54.944 --> 01:57:55.987
Welcome back, Captain.

01:57:56.154 --> 01:57:58.072
Oh, thank you very much. Coming through.

01:57:58.239 --> 01:57:59.240
Captain!

01:57:59.407 --> 01:58:00.241
Thank you.

01:58:00.408 --> 01:58:01.242
I remember you.

01:58:01.409 --> 01:58:02.618
Sirs. Thank you.

01:58:02.785 --> 01:58:04.787
Oh, good. Master Gibbs.

01:58:04.954 --> 01:58:06.622
The ship is yours, Captain.

01:58:06.789 --> 01:58:07.874
Ah, thank you.

01:58:19.927 --> 01:58:21.137
Monkey.

01:58:28.269 --> 01:58:29.604
Thank you.

01:58:30.313 --> 01:58:32.648
What be our heading, Captain?

01:58:32.815 --> 01:58:35.610
We shall follow the stars, Master Gibbs.

01:58:35.777 --> 01:58:38.404
Aye, aye, Captain!

01:58:43.951 --> 01:58:47.955
I have a rendezvous
beyond my beloved horizon.
