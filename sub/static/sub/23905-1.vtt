00:51.047 --> 00:53.044
I thought we were gonna play ball.

01:14.927 --> 01:16.918
Come on.

01:17.007 --> 01:19.316
Come on!

01:26.647 --> 01:28.763
Stay, Bo-jay

01:54.487 --> 01:55.966
Hey, Mr Higgins.

01:55.967 --> 01:58.686
Did you see something come down
ten minutes ago?

01:58.687 --> 02:00.566
Yeah. It's in the clearing.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.964
It's really incredible.
Come on, you have to come see it.

02:11.967 --> 02:14.158
It's just through here.

03:58.967 --> 04:01.806
- Sam. Great to see you. How are you?
- Mr Jarvis.

04:01.807 --> 04:03.926
This is Dr Sefton.

04:03.927 --> 04:07.563
- Mary. Hi.
- Sam. Hi.

04:11.127 --> 04:14.683
- What the hell's he doing here?
- This is important, Sam.

04:17.247 --> 04:19.685
- Sorry about the short notice.
- No problem.

04:19.687 --> 04:21.878
They have their IDs?

04:24.207 --> 04:25.886
So I'm a Cavanaugh now.

04:25.887 --> 04:29.406
We're tourists. If anyone asks,
I'm Charles Cavanaugh.

04:29.407 --> 04:31.246
Dr Sefton is your sister.

04:31.247 --> 04:33.283
My sister?

04:33.367 --> 04:38.486
Of whom you are extremely fond in a
clean-cut, healthy, all-American way.

04:38.487 --> 04:42.680
- Where's my sister been all my life?
- Dr Sefton is on loan from NASA.

04:43.807 --> 04:46.086
Jarvis, get the trunk for me,
will you?

04:46.087 --> 04:48.686
Since when did the office
start drafting civilians?

04:48.687 --> 04:51.726
All you need to know
is that in the scheme of things,

04:51.727 --> 04:54.446
she is much more valuable to us
than you are.

04:54.447 --> 04:56.686
I take it you're as valuable as ever?

04:56.687 --> 04:58.678
Naturally.

04:58.767 --> 05:02.406
So if you two are being shot at,
which bullet do I take?

05:02.407 --> 05:05.280
You must try for both, of course.

05:20.327 --> 05:25.317
What's so important to draw you out
of your office and into the field?

05:26.207 --> 05:30.126
Something unusual was reported
entering our atmosphere last night.

05:30.127 --> 05:33.717
One of our Keyhole satellites
picked this up.

05:37.687 --> 05:42.126
- You wanna give me a hint?
- See the little blur, top left?

05:42.127 --> 05:43.355
Yeah.

05:43.447 --> 05:47.560
The analysts speculate
that's where the UFO may have landed.

05:48.167 --> 05:51.966
- That's all we have?
- We immediately sent in two agents.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.726
Deitman and Truly.

05:53.727 --> 05:58.842
They have not reported back and we
have not been able to contact them.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.766
Peripheral reports?

06:01.767 --> 06:05.406
The usual ground sightings.
Reports of a landing.

06:05.407 --> 06:09.606
Then a local TV station sent
in a mobile unit to do a spot-cast.

06:09.607 --> 06:13.566
And they reported
that indeed a UFO had landed.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.886
An hour later they changed
their tune.

06:15.887 --> 06:17.726
Claimed it was a hoax.

06:17.727 --> 06:22.326
A fraud perpetrated by a couple of
farm boys who built this spaceship.

06:22.327 --> 06:23.965
Nice sign.

06:48.887 --> 06:51.446
- You go ahead. I'll catch up.
- OK.

06:51.447 --> 06:54.686
Tell me, Mary,
what exactly do you do for NASA?

06:54.687 --> 06:58.606
- My speciality's exobiology.
- Exobiology?

06:58.607 --> 07:02.246
It's the study of what alien life
forms might be like.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.880
You make a living at that?

07:05.407 --> 07:07.326
Seems it'd be mostly guesswork.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.446
We used to joke in school

07:08.447 --> 07:11.926
that ours was the only science
without a subject matter.

07:11.927 --> 07:15.926
So you people are with the office
of scientific intelligence.

07:15.927 --> 07:18.126
Till two days ago
I hadn't heard of it.

07:18.127 --> 07:21.166
You wouldn't have.
Our existence isn't public knowledge.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.686
Eisenhower started O-SCI back in '59.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.486
We're an offshoot of the CIA,

07:25.487 --> 07:29.286
but the old man runs it
like his own private dictatorship.

07:29.287 --> 07:32.646
- Pay for this, will you, Sam?
- Sure, Charles.

07:32.647 --> 07:35.839
Three for the... flying saucer.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.406
What do you hear, Sam?

07:47.407 --> 07:48.920
No birds.

07:50.087 --> 07:53.882
Right. No birds.

08:35.207 --> 08:38.285
Care to see inside, sir?
Only a buck more.

08:38.287 --> 08:41.326
That's a bargain.
Let's have a look, shall we?

08:41.327 --> 08:43.078
Sure.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.441
Hi.

08:45.847 --> 08:49.881
Let's see... Three dollars.
There you go.

08:52.207 --> 08:54.363
How much have you made so far?

08:55.247 --> 08:57.363
About $320.

08:59.927 --> 09:01.963
I'll go first.

09:16.647 --> 09:18.478
Thanks.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.966
Could you help me here?

09:20.967 --> 09:22.161
Thanks.

09:27.807 --> 09:30.321
Thank you.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.046
Let's go, lady.
I'm trying to run a business here.

09:38.047 --> 09:40.166
It doesn't look safe.

09:40.167 --> 09:43.046
It is. We've been taking people
through all day.

09:43.047 --> 09:45.246
She balked
at the Pirates of the Caribbean.

09:45.247 --> 09:46.965
Come on.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.806
Keep the money, guys.
We're running late.

09:49.807 --> 09:52.162
Come on.

09:52.247 --> 09:53.760
Come on.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.798
Thanks, guys.

10:07.087 --> 10:09.960
- Well, Charles?
- Wait a minute.

10:10.487 --> 10:11.886
Couldn't see anything,

10:11.887 --> 10:14.886
but there was definitely
something strange going on.

10:14.887 --> 10:16.966
What about the burn marks?

10:16.967 --> 10:19.046
The burn marks were real.

10:19.047 --> 10:22.926
Something landed there,
but not that thing.

10:22.927 --> 10:26.086
Why that thing?
Why the cover-up? Go on, Mary.

10:26.087 --> 10:29.806
There was something odd
about those boys. And the men.

10:29.807 --> 10:31.686
What, precisely?

10:31.687 --> 10:36.086
I know this doesn't necessarily
qualify as scientific evidence,

10:36.087 --> 10:39.406
but a woman is used to
a certain response from men,

10:39.407 --> 10:43.766
and from those boys
I didn't even get the automatic...

10:43.767 --> 10:46.435
When I was introduced to Sam,
he did this.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.526
I did not do that.

10:49.527 --> 10:52.366
Based on what I was doing
with my blouse,

10:52.367 --> 10:54.806
they should have tried
to look down my top...

10:54.807 --> 10:56.918
Wouldn't have had to try very hard.

10:57.967 --> 11:02.604
We'll go to the TV station that
broadcast those conflicting reports.

11:03.367 --> 11:06.646
Try something and let me know
if you get the same reaction.

11:06.647 --> 11:08.644
- Yes.
- Let's go.

11:09.407 --> 11:13.395
- I did that when we first met?
- You're still doing it.

11:31.407 --> 11:35.486
- Stay by the car.
- I'll keep it up there and wait.

11:40.327 --> 11:41.806
That's fine.

11:44.767 --> 11:49.085
The FCC does not take
misrepresentation lightly, Mr Barnes.

11:50.287 --> 11:53.046
We made an explanation over the air.

11:53.047 --> 11:54.286
What else do you want?

11:54.287 --> 11:58.966
We fell victim to a practical joke.
It was a mistake.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.964
We're only human, after all.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.803
Damn. Could I borrow your pen?

12:17.367 --> 12:19.446
Well, I've seen the site.

12:19.447 --> 12:23.086
I find it difficult to imagine
that a couple of farm boys

12:23.087 --> 12:25.846
could have pulled off
a hoax like that on their own.

12:25.847 --> 12:29.403
Are you implying
that my station was in on it?

12:30.647 --> 12:32.717
Be realistic.

12:33.447 --> 12:34.562
Hold it!

12:44.887 --> 12:47.555
He's still moving.

12:51.287 --> 12:54.286
- My God!
- Well, well, well.

12:54.287 --> 12:57.166
- What the hell is that?
- Our visitor, I presume.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.486
Careful.

13:24.247 --> 13:25.680
No! Sam!

13:25.767 --> 13:28.246
I want to take it back.

13:28.247 --> 13:31.007
Give me that case.

13:43.767 --> 13:47.166
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Barnes.

13:47.167 --> 13:51.804
We will be in touch with you as soon
as I complete the investigation.

13:55.447 --> 13:57.319
They're on their way right now.

13:59.287 --> 14:01.801
Let's go, Sam.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.084
Sorry.

14:18.407 --> 14:19.999
This way.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.486
Billy, they're coming through.

14:24.487 --> 14:26.678
Stop them, Billy.

14:28.247 --> 14:31.726
<i>... you can stay calm,
those around you will react...</i>

14:31.727 --> 14:35.124
<i>Especially if you have children.
Once...</i>

14:38.487 --> 14:40.882
Could I see some ID, please, sir?

14:41.367 --> 14:44.446
Sam, you drive. Jarvis,
get in the car.

14:44.447 --> 14:46.683
Get away from the car, officer.

14:50.647 --> 14:52.239
Get in the car.

15:01.407 --> 15:03.916
He's on the car, Sam!

15:04.207 --> 15:05.560
Get out!

15:10.367 --> 15:12.922
- Get out.
- Get him off!

15:20.247 --> 15:21.566
Get him off.

15:39.087 --> 15:41.286
It's the kid from the spaceship.

15:41.287 --> 15:45.036
- Get him off the car.
- Jarvis, help him.

15:57.927 --> 15:59.997
My God.

16:00.687 --> 16:04.675
- Sam. You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

16:20.647 --> 16:25.166
Make sure Langley understands we must
stop this before it spreads.

16:25.167 --> 16:28.166
I want that town sealed up
completely.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.046
Put up perimeter roadblocks...

16:30.047 --> 16:32.766
Not local police.
They have been compromised.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.758
Right?

16:34.847 --> 16:36.686
The troops you send in

16:36.687 --> 16:39.246
must put up a challenge at 100 yards

16:39.247 --> 16:42.726
and shoot anyone
who comes closer than 50 yards.

16:42.727 --> 16:46.006
Get Holland
to take a hazard response team

16:46.007 --> 16:48.286
and investigate the landing site.

16:48.287 --> 16:49.966
There is no time to waste...

16:49.967 --> 16:52.126
- Thanks.
- Sure.

16:52.127 --> 16:56.246
We should exercise
extreme caution.

16:56.247 --> 16:59.086
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

16:59.087 --> 17:00.805
What wasn't?

17:00.887 --> 17:03.117
First contact.

17:03.207 --> 17:06.205
What did you expect? ET?

17:06.207 --> 17:08.486
No, but it would have been nice.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.566
I never liked that little troll.

17:10.567 --> 17:14.126
He's in his element. He's only
really happy during a crisis.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.721
Yeah. Alive.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.846
A little tense between you two?

17:20.847 --> 17:23.435
Yeah, well, he's my father.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.486
This is incredible.

18:03.487 --> 18:05.646
- Graves.
- Quite incredible.

18:05.647 --> 18:11.086
Plenty of time for amazement later.
Right now I need facts.

18:11.087 --> 18:13.366
OK, here's one. It's dead.

18:13.367 --> 18:14.595
Are you sure?

18:14.687 --> 18:18.886
No body heat, no electrical activity
and no movement.

18:18.887 --> 18:21.926
If we vented the chamber,
it'd be pretty ripe in there.

18:21.927 --> 18:24.606
We gave it quite a jolt of
electrical current.

18:24.607 --> 18:28.686
Probably vascular collapse, although
most parasites, when separated...

18:28.687 --> 18:31.366
Dr Sefton will define
what we're dealing with.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.446
Right. How do you
want to handle this?

18:33.447 --> 18:38.486
We need to know how the creature
interfaces with our nervous system.

18:38.487 --> 18:40.606
We should split into teams,

18:40.607 --> 18:43.566
each focusing on a different aspect
of the alien.

18:43.567 --> 18:47.086
Biochemistry, physiology,
reproduction.

18:47.087 --> 18:49.446
- Endocrinology...
- Wait a minute.

18:49.447 --> 18:52.766
What we need to know
is who we're fighting

18:52.767 --> 18:54.326
and how to fight them.

18:54.327 --> 18:56.726
Is that clear to both of you?

18:56.727 --> 19:01.086
It's one o'clock. In two hours
I'm calling a meeting at the office.

19:01.087 --> 19:03.926
Make sure you have
something for me by then.

19:26.847 --> 19:28.838
Brad, cover.

19:41.887 --> 19:43.766
OK, Jim, tape this.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.958
And get a water sample.

19:46.607 --> 19:48.325
I'll be damned.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.280
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. I'll check you out later.

20:02.887 --> 20:06.166
- Any trouble in Iowa?
- Not like you people had.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.686
I heard you had to take a couple
of people out.

20:08.687 --> 20:10.566
These weren't people any more.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.926
You shoot, they just keep on coming.

20:12.927 --> 20:15.800
Any word on Deitman and Truly?

20:17.087 --> 20:20.996
- Has anyone told their wives yet?
- Not yet.

20:26.967 --> 20:29.126
So what are we looking at here?

20:29.127 --> 20:32.406
It seemed something organic
had eaten its way into the earth

20:32.407 --> 20:34.598
below the water table.

20:34.967 --> 20:39.286
Now, whatever was hiding
in that fake saucer was moved.

20:39.287 --> 20:41.366
A hole filled with water was left.

20:41.367 --> 20:45.846
What's your guess? How many of those
things could have been in that hole?

20:45.847 --> 20:50.326
Based on the size of the cavity,
could have been thousands.

20:50.327 --> 20:53.406
I don't know if this counts for
anything, but...

20:53.407 --> 20:58.166
that kid said 320 people had gone
through that ship about 11 hours ago.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.246
What's the population of Ambrose?

21:00.247 --> 21:02.283
10,001.

21:03.727 --> 21:07.078
- All right, Mary, let's go.
- OK.

21:08.287 --> 21:11.206
Please keep in mind
we were a little rushed.

21:14.207 --> 21:18.486
Here's the creature, with an incision
along its ventral surface.

21:18.487 --> 21:23.646
The first thing that stands out
is the complexity of its neo-cortex.

21:23.647 --> 21:28.206
In a human, brain tissue accounts
for about 5%% of total body mass.

21:28.207 --> 21:31.046
But in this creature,
and here's the brain tissue,

21:31.047 --> 21:34.125
it accounts for about 60%% .

21:37.367 --> 21:42.846
This black tentacle, which we saw
jet across Barnes's office,

21:42.847 --> 21:48.366
contains a probe. An interface
between the creature and its host.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.846
The probe penetrates the brain

21:50.847 --> 21:56.646
while these hooks here and here
lock into the spinal column.

21:56.647 --> 21:59.998
Together they override
the human nervous system.

22:00.647 --> 22:06.240
Wait. Are you saying that these slugs
are using us like puppets?

22:07.367 --> 22:08.516
Exactly.

22:08.607 --> 22:11.646
You didn't mention whether
the creature has eyes. Does it?

22:11.647 --> 22:14.566
We haven't been able
to locate any sensory organs.

22:16.527 --> 22:17.516
Anything else?

22:17.607 --> 22:22.046
We found human DNA and protein
inside the creature.

22:22.047 --> 22:26.406
They're able to adapt to whichever
life form they're riding on.

22:26.407 --> 22:29.446
We breathe oxygen
so they breathe oxygen.

22:29.447 --> 22:31.006
The two systems merge.

22:31.007 --> 22:33.406
Can't we exploit this
potential weakness?

22:33.407 --> 22:36.446
What affects the host
might also affect the parasite.

22:36.447 --> 22:39.844
We must find something
they're vulnerable to and we're not.

22:40.247 --> 22:43.166
The people being ridden
seemed stronger than normal.

22:43.167 --> 22:47.086
We think they boost adrenaline
production into their host.

22:47.087 --> 22:50.166
Like injecting nitro into
a car's fuel line.

22:50.167 --> 22:54.166
The car will run faster
but the engine will burn out sooner.

22:54.167 --> 22:58.206
It's really quite a remarkable
organism.

22:58.207 --> 23:00.766
Much more efficient
than anything on earth.

23:00.767 --> 23:04.766
Look how elegant
the cartilaginous structure is.

23:04.767 --> 23:08.686
Incredible. It doesn't use
haemoglobin in oxygen transport.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.126
It uses a chlorophyll derivative.

23:11.127 --> 23:14.286
Jeez, Graves. He sounds like
he wants to fuck the thing.

23:14.287 --> 23:16.686
Shut up, Holland.

23:16.687 --> 23:20.446
Dr Sefton, do you have any idea
how we should proceed?

23:20.447 --> 23:22.766
This was a preliminary postmortem...

23:22.767 --> 23:25.037
When did you quit smoking?

23:27.447 --> 23:30.480
- Must have left them in the car.
- Stop him!

23:39.967 --> 23:42.158
Jesus. He's got one on him!

23:45.207 --> 23:46.606
Security!

23:50.407 --> 23:52.846
Alex, go upstairs!

23:52.847 --> 23:55.846
Secure the exit.
Bonnie, call 334, main gate.

23:55.847 --> 23:57.844
- Come on, upstairs.
- Main gate.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.962
Alex!

25:27.447 --> 25:29.842
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

25:33.967 --> 25:37.159
- Harris, get a medic.
- Right.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.486
- Sam?
- We got him.

25:46.487 --> 25:50.202
I guess that thing
jumped onto whoever it ran into.

25:57.367 --> 26:00.606
Put your gun down, Sam. Slowly.

26:00.607 --> 26:03.367
Take off your shirt.

26:14.967 --> 26:17.117
Thank you.

26:20.327 --> 26:23.405
Well, let's find it.
Search everybody.

26:26.087 --> 26:28.166
Right, everyone's accounted for.

26:28.167 --> 26:30.406
- One of the aliens...
- This was on Jarvis.

26:30.407 --> 26:35.397
It contains every emergency
contingency we've drawn up since '59.

26:36.727 --> 26:40.486
One of the alien life forms
is loose in the building.

26:40.487 --> 26:45.086
We have to presume that it's riding
on the back of one of us.

26:45.087 --> 26:48.085
Sam, show them your back.

26:51.167 --> 26:53.635
Sam is clean.

26:58.887 --> 27:03.524
Holland. Gorman.
Miss Haines. Everybody.

27:12.847 --> 27:15.925
Miss Haines. Everybody.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.046
What about you, sir?

27:19.567 --> 27:22.884
Yeah, she's right. You're not exempt.

27:29.967 --> 27:31.116
Stop her!

27:32.407 --> 27:34.996
Gannet, Beasley, come on!

27:36.167 --> 27:38.044
Miss Haines!

27:45.567 --> 27:48.122
Miss Haines! Come back here!

28:05.487 --> 28:07.523
Let go of me!

28:35.247 --> 28:38.406
- They're down in the kitchen.
- Hurry up! Let's go down!

28:38.407 --> 28:40.726
Damn! I lost it!

28:40.727 --> 28:43.126
Forget it. Forget it.

28:43.127 --> 28:45.243
I lost it.

28:47.487 --> 28:49.966
It was too quick.
It went up through there.

28:49.967 --> 28:52.006
I want that thing found tonight.

28:52.007 --> 28:54.246
Turn the building upside down,
but find it.

28:54.247 --> 28:56.642
- Miss Haines?
- Sam, get cleaned up.

28:57.207 --> 29:00.686
I want every second of Jarvis's time
accounted for.

29:00.687 --> 29:03.686
I want to know everything he was
up to since we left Iowa.

29:03.687 --> 29:05.957
Go and get a medic, will you?

29:11.167 --> 29:11.963
God...

29:18.287 --> 29:21.566
He's been like this
since you brought him in.

29:21.567 --> 29:26.246
In many ways he's exhibiting
classic withdrawal symptoms,

29:26.247 --> 29:29.286
much like you'd find
in a drug addict.

29:29.287 --> 29:33.446
Are you saying he was actually
addicted to having that thing on him?

29:33.447 --> 29:36.366
No, he's saying
that the presence of the thing

29:36.367 --> 29:39.926
satisfies some need or other.

29:39.927 --> 29:41.804
Thanks, doc.

29:41.887 --> 29:45.526
Jarvis is cold turkey
and Miss Haines is in a coma.

29:45.527 --> 29:48.646
- All victims will react this way?
- How would you react?

29:48.647 --> 29:51.126
One minute you have this huge brain,
the next moment you don't.

29:51.127 --> 29:52.560
Think of it.

29:57.407 --> 30:01.366
It'd be a lot easier if they had
a live specimen to work with.

30:01.367 --> 30:06.516
- What do you think these things are?
- Let's have a look.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.606
They almost look like antennae.

30:13.607 --> 30:15.526
What are they receiving?

30:15.527 --> 30:17.846
Or transmitting, for that matter.

30:17.847 --> 30:21.886
Radar, maybe. Or sonar signals,
like bats.

30:21.887 --> 30:27.445
Do you think that's how the aliens
are able to recognise each other?

31:23.927 --> 31:25.440
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:27.727 --> 31:31.406
- You're the manager of the building?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

31:31.407 --> 31:34.724
I need to get inside the apartment
of Neil Jarvis.

31:37.527 --> 31:38.437
Yeah, sure.

31:39.447 --> 31:41.926
Just a second.
I'll be right with you.

31:41.927 --> 31:44.406
Do you have a crowbar?

31:44.407 --> 31:46.996
No, I got the keys.

31:47.807 --> 31:49.798
Up this way.

31:50.847 --> 31:52.838
Anybody here?

31:54.887 --> 31:56.878
Hello?

31:59.367 --> 32:02.286
These arrived this morning for
Mr Jarvis.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.399
- I let the delivery people in.
- Give me a hand.

32:05.727 --> 32:07.399
Yeah, sure.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.803
Iowa. I wonder what that's all about.

32:17.767 --> 32:20.356
What the hell are those things?

33:06.207 --> 33:11.086
<i>The president's scheduled appearance
at the digital age conference</i>

33:11.087 --> 33:14.006
<i>has drawn harsh criticism
from Senator Allen,</i>

33:14.007 --> 33:17.836
<i>who categorised the visit
as blatant grandstanding.</i>

33:24.767 --> 33:28.566
Make sure the magnetometer's cranked
up early. We don't want delays.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.046
Has headquarters given us
the name of our post standers?

33:31.047 --> 33:33.242
Yes.

33:33.327 --> 33:36.166
I need more agents on that balcony.

33:36.167 --> 33:39.279
- And all along this perimeter.
- OK.

33:41.167 --> 33:42.246
Long time no see.

33:42.247 --> 33:45.766
Good to see you, Bruce. This is
Evan Greenberg, one of my agents.

33:45.767 --> 33:47.846
- How are you, Evan?
- Hi.

33:47.847 --> 33:49.406
What brings you down here?

33:49.407 --> 33:52.526
I understand the president
is scheduled to appear here.

33:52.527 --> 33:54.326
If everything goes as planned.

33:54.327 --> 33:58.440
There's a situation developing
that I think you need to know about.

33:59.207 --> 34:01.238
Can we talk in private?

34:02.087 --> 34:05.045
Yeah. Come on.

34:20.887 --> 34:24.362
OK. Now, Sam, what's this all about?

34:26.487 --> 34:28.120
What the hell are you doing?

34:44.806 --> 34:50.127
<i>Please take your seats. The opening
session is about to begin.</i>

35:38.807 --> 35:43.159
- Good to see you.
- Welcome, Mr President. This way.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.486
Get him.

36:16.567 --> 36:18.519
Alpha One, he's headed your way.

36:21.927 --> 36:24.357
Watch where you're going.

36:36.687 --> 36:40.675
Bruce, will you tell me
what's happening here, please?

36:55.607 --> 36:58.121
<i>Clear?</i>

36:58.207 --> 37:01.040
<i>Dead.</i>

37:06.727 --> 37:09.446
Are you all right, sir?

37:09.447 --> 37:10.562
Andrew.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.800
What in God's name is going on?

37:22.767 --> 37:25.446
Damn! There! There he is!

37:25.447 --> 37:27.961
Stop! Hold it!

37:32.967 --> 37:34.286
Stop!

37:43.327 --> 37:44.203
Again.

37:48.807 --> 37:50.843
Watch out!

37:50.927 --> 37:53.361
Hold up.

38:03.687 --> 38:06.082
Jesus, that was close.

38:06.927 --> 38:10.642
- You think he would have shot me?
- Of course he would.

38:15.687 --> 38:18.082
Get him to the lab.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.126
What does all this mean?

38:46.127 --> 38:49.486
Top line is Sam's heart rate.
Bottom is the alien's.

38:49.487 --> 38:51.646
They're identical. Brain waves too.

38:51.647 --> 38:53.526
Their nervous systems are linked.

38:53.527 --> 38:57.846
<i>Pulse is 120. Blood pressure
140l90.Temperature 103.</i>

38:57.847 --> 38:59.486
Creature's running him hot.

38:59.487 --> 39:02.366
Move the fluoroscope
to the right profile, please.

39:02.367 --> 39:03.356
What's this?

39:03.447 --> 39:08.646
An electromagnetic signal. At first
we thought it was just interference.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.006
It seems to be coming
from the parasite.

39:11.007 --> 39:13.437
- You were right, then. Radar.
- Yeah.

39:14.167 --> 39:16.881
- Let me hear it.
- It's too high a frequency.

39:18.127 --> 39:20.486
Wake him up. I'm going in there.

39:20.487 --> 39:24.766
Sir, it's not a good idea.
I don't think it's safe in there.

39:24.767 --> 39:27.356
It's Sam, Lawrence.

39:29.687 --> 39:31.639
- Sir?
- It's all right.

39:33.207 --> 39:34.601
Wake him up, Jim.

39:46.887 --> 39:49.078
Bring me that stool.

39:53.567 --> 39:55.246
Can you hear me?

39:56.207 --> 39:58.286
Sam isn't here any more, Andrew.

39:58.287 --> 40:00.517
You know me?

40:00.607 --> 40:02.923
And your dead wife.

40:07.007 --> 40:09.077
And Mary.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.286
You wouldn't believe the fantasies
my host has about you, Mary.

40:19.287 --> 40:21.966
- Would you like me to tell you?
- No, we would not.

40:21.967 --> 40:26.486
I will ask the questions,
and if you do not cooperate,

40:26.487 --> 40:29.366
I'll administer electric shocks
and you will die.

40:29.367 --> 40:33.003
I will stop the heart of this host
and it will die.

40:39.727 --> 40:40.603
Get him back!

40:40.687 --> 40:43.126
- He's gone flatline!
- 2cc of ephinephrine!

40:43.127 --> 40:46.886
2cc of ephinephrine, stat.

40:46.887 --> 40:48.843
It's back.

40:48.927 --> 40:52.119
Hold that ephinephrine.

40:54.287 --> 40:57.206
My God, it has total control.

41:04.007 --> 41:07.199
Sam, why have they come here?
What do they want?

41:11.447 --> 41:13.677
I warned you.

41:13.767 --> 41:15.644
Shock it.

41:36.887 --> 41:41.526
I acknowledge you can hurt me, but
each shock shortens your son's life.

41:41.527 --> 41:43.926
Do you understand?

41:43.927 --> 41:46.766
Of course I understand.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.646
Now you answer me.

41:49.647 --> 41:51.963
Why are you here?

41:55.847 --> 41:59.446
Our previous hosts ceased to be
useful.

41:59.447 --> 42:02.646
You are stronger than they were.
You will last longer.

42:02.647 --> 42:06.556
Right. How many are you?

42:11.087 --> 42:12.281
One.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.926
There may be semantic differences.

42:16.927 --> 42:20.563
Its concept of identity
may be different.

42:21.167 --> 42:22.395
No.

42:23.367 --> 42:25.358
No.

42:25.447 --> 42:27.205
How many are you?

42:27.887 --> 42:29.081
One.

42:33.967 --> 42:37.477
Sam, do you have any idea
how many of them there are?

42:38.967 --> 42:43.206
It was thinking "one".
It doesn't know why you keep...

42:46.807 --> 42:49.406
Always giving orders, aren't you,
Andrew?

42:49.407 --> 42:52.167
Always telling people how to run
their lives.

42:52.927 --> 42:57.325
Maybe that's why you're so Ionely.
Did you ever think of that?

42:58.647 --> 43:01.759
Maybe that's why
your son resents you so much.

43:07.487 --> 43:12.686
You won't be Ionely when you're
one of us. No-one will be.

43:12.687 --> 43:15.486
For God's sake,
tell us what you want.

43:15.487 --> 43:17.921
Peace.

43:25.927 --> 43:28.766
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.

43:35.767 --> 43:37.086
Jesus. It's killing him.

43:37.087 --> 43:38.440
Get it off him!

44:23.767 --> 44:25.246
It's gone.

44:35.687 --> 44:37.996
Welcome back.

44:42.967 --> 44:46.125
I'm sorry you had to
go through that, son.

44:48.007 --> 44:50.482
Those things I said, Dad.

44:50.887 --> 44:54.443
- It wasn't me talking.
- Come on.

44:56.847 --> 44:59.402
Do you remember what happened?

45:00.287 --> 45:05.406
I was aware. I was conscious of what
I was doing and what was happening.

45:05.407 --> 45:09.202
It was like having one of those
dreams when you're paralysed.

45:11.247 --> 45:17.317
No matter how much I tried
to move or scream, I just couldn't.

45:18.527 --> 45:21.161
It had total control over me.

45:22.247 --> 45:25.446
I was like an open book to them.

45:25.447 --> 45:30.446
They could read everything in my
mind. My thoughts, fears, memories.

45:30.447 --> 45:32.842
Did they have thoughts?

45:39.327 --> 45:42.087
I remember something about...

45:44.767 --> 45:47.526
<i>...their ship...</i>

45:47.527 --> 45:52.806
It wasn't a ship, though.
It was like a nerve centre.

45:52.807 --> 45:54.798
A hive.

45:57.047 --> 45:59.326
Had to get back to it...

45:59.327 --> 46:03.126
<i>...to share information
with the others.</i>

46:03.127 --> 46:06.797
You know where it is? Do you?

46:09.167 --> 46:11.358
I'm not sure where, really.

46:16.087 --> 46:18.396
Get some rest.

46:19.367 --> 46:21.483
Get some rest.

46:29.887 --> 46:32.999
Let me know as soon as
I can try again.

47:32.807 --> 47:35.726
<i>Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.</i>

47:38.527 --> 47:41.206
That's enough of that. Take it off.

47:41.207 --> 47:43.084
Sir.

47:43.167 --> 47:46.366
The parasites run their hosts
at a high body temperature,

47:46.367 --> 47:49.166
which gives them
an identifiable heat signature.

47:49.167 --> 47:52.246
We have been able to track
that heat signature

47:52.247 --> 47:56.566
through thermal imaging from
satellite sweeps and reconnaissance.

47:56.567 --> 47:59.166
Run the RPV recording.

47:59.167 --> 48:03.886
This is Ambrose, and those red areas
are creature-controlled.

48:03.887 --> 48:07.046
Give me maximum magnification here,
please.

48:07.047 --> 48:09.397
I want to show you something.

48:09.727 --> 48:13.446
These are human beings
with creatures on their back.

48:13.447 --> 48:16.686
- What's the green dot?
- A human being without a creature.

48:16.687 --> 48:20.038
He's surrounded
by parasite-controlled hosts.

48:21.007 --> 48:24.119
And now he too has a parasite
on his back.

48:45.247 --> 48:48.966
I'm not... I'm not coming.

48:48.967 --> 48:51.720
I'm sorry, Dad.

48:54.327 --> 48:56.563
Get this off me.

49:09.167 --> 49:12.165
Everybody, just get off of me.

49:16.167 --> 49:18.158
It's OK.

49:22.487 --> 49:26.126
- Get it off me!
- It's not on you any more.

49:26.127 --> 49:28.206
It's not on you any more.

49:28.207 --> 49:30.641
OK? You're OK.

49:30.727 --> 49:32.806
- You're OK.
- I can still feel it.

49:32.807 --> 49:35.441
It's gone. It's gone.

50:01.447 --> 50:03.717
You're all right.

50:06.167 --> 50:08.766
Have we been in contact
with the governor?

50:08.767 --> 50:10.406
What about the Iowa National Guard?

50:10.407 --> 50:13.806
They will have been infiltrated.
You have to go in on a federal level.

50:13.807 --> 50:16.926
Our nearest troops are the first
infantry division at Fort Riley.

50:16.927 --> 50:21.326
- How quickly can we move on this?
- You'll have a force in 12 hours.

50:21.327 --> 50:25.315
I recommend we go in at night to take
advantage of the thermal imaging.

50:27.087 --> 50:29.078
Do it.

51:50.967 --> 51:53.806
Wait. I see something.

52:22.487 --> 52:24.045
We're going in.

52:35.847 --> 52:37.838
Go.

52:43.127 --> 52:45.277
Shit.

52:49.887 --> 52:52.046
- Gentlemen.
- What's this?

52:52.047 --> 52:56.718
- This is a thermal image feed.
- It's from Lieutenant Abbey's unit.

52:58.807 --> 53:01.286
They're using children?

53:01.287 --> 53:04.877
You cannot think of them as children.
They are the enemy.

53:30.567 --> 53:32.797
General?

53:34.367 --> 53:38.640
- They're here to see you, sir.
- In the office. I'll be in soon.

53:42.007 --> 53:44.441
This way, men.

53:56.927 --> 54:01.566
We've lost satellite link-up, but
we have Lieutenant Abbey on audio.

54:01.567 --> 54:03.926
<i>The situation's under control now.</i>

54:03.927 --> 54:06.446
<i>We'll bring the children
into the holding area</i>

54:06.447 --> 54:09.246
<i>then move on to sector seven.
Thank you.</i>

54:09.247 --> 54:11.283
So far so good.

54:12.407 --> 54:14.286
What's going on in here?

54:14.287 --> 54:17.206
Captain Earley, sir.
Iowa National Guard, Camp Dodge.

54:17.207 --> 54:19.286
We're here to provide backup.

54:19.287 --> 54:22.285
I didn't hear anything
about you being called in.

54:24.687 --> 54:28.596
- Get me Washington on the line.
- I'd rather you didn't.

54:58.687 --> 55:00.286
Did you find a way
to kill them?

55:00.287 --> 55:02.966
No, not yet. We're trying everything.

55:02.967 --> 55:05.806
Different bacteria, viruses,
radiation.

55:06.127 --> 55:09.956
But so far we've found nothing
that doesn't kill the host.

55:13.687 --> 55:17.686
See the one looking at us? He's
wearing the slug we took off you.

55:17.687 --> 55:19.926
They've been sitting like that
for hours.

55:19.927 --> 55:24.006
Yeah, they're merging. It's how
they communicate with each other.

55:24.527 --> 55:27.006
- Yeah?
- They exchange chemical signatures.

55:27.007 --> 55:29.846
We're ready, Dr Graves.

55:32.807 --> 55:34.606
We should have thought of that.

55:34.607 --> 55:37.480
Ants communicate in the same way.

55:39.127 --> 55:40.966
Where did you get
the second parasite?

55:40.967 --> 55:41.877
Just watch.

55:45.087 --> 55:47.766
We set up a keyboard
in case they want to talk to us.

55:47.767 --> 55:49.958
Vargas, note the time.

55:58.527 --> 56:01.400
- Does the old man know about this?
- He wanted to make sure.

56:02.327 --> 56:04.324
Here we go again.

56:05.527 --> 56:07.926
This is how they reproduce.

56:07.927 --> 56:10.166
A second adult parasite in minutes.

56:10.167 --> 56:13.040
Vargas, get the old man on the line.

56:15.647 --> 56:17.724
Watch what they do to the little one.

56:55.167 --> 56:58.165
The new one knows me.

57:03.327 --> 57:06.246
I've got General Morgan reporting in.

57:07.007 --> 57:09.886
Andrew Nivens here, general.

57:09.887 --> 57:12.206
How is it going down there?

57:12.207 --> 57:15.926
It was touch and go for a while,
but we think the worst is over now.

57:15.927 --> 57:17.726
- It's your son.
- Hang on, Sam.

57:17.727 --> 57:19.766
<i>We've got 70%% % of the area contained</i>

57:19.767 --> 57:22.126
<i>- and kept casualties fairly low.
- Thank you.</i>

57:22.127 --> 57:27.003
Would you take off your shirt
and turn your back to the camera?

57:27.487 --> 57:30.886
<i>- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not. Take off your shirt.</i>

57:30.887 --> 57:32.884
<i>I don't take my orders from you.</i>

57:33.487 --> 57:36.076
Order him to take off his shirt. Sam,
go on.

57:39.447 --> 57:43.117
I'm sorry, general. Would you
humour us for a moment, please?

57:44.847 --> 57:46.883
God.

57:55.127 --> 57:58.478
- There's no signal coming in.
- What's going on?

58:00.647 --> 58:03.046
The transmission isn't lost.

58:03.047 --> 58:07.566
The transmission has been cut because
General Morgan has been taken,

58:07.567 --> 58:10.486
and we can assume
that his troops are now our enemy.

58:12.287 --> 58:15.606
We're getting reports
that the situation's been contained.

58:15.607 --> 58:18.806
The reports are faked.
We're being manipulated.

58:18.807 --> 58:21.282
I have just been told

58:21.767 --> 58:26.246
that their numbers are increasing
infinitely more than anticipated.

58:26.247 --> 58:28.326
We've lost a town, sir.

58:28.327 --> 58:30.643
Now we've lost an army.

58:33.247 --> 58:36.846
They're capable of transmitting
not just intelligence but memory

58:36.847 --> 58:40.326
from one body to the next
by coming into physical contact.

58:40.327 --> 58:43.606
The new one knew Sam as if
it had been the one on his back?

58:43.607 --> 58:45.006
Yes.

58:45.087 --> 58:47.806
How long does it take it
to prepare for division?

58:47.807 --> 58:52.285
12 hours. Let's assume
we started with 1,000 of them.

58:52.567 --> 58:56.926
We'll be conservative.
That's one day, 4,000.

58:56.927 --> 59:00.403
Two days, 16,000.

59:00.967 --> 59:06.764
- In two weeks there would be...
- More than 250 billion.

59:23.247 --> 59:25.363
You OK?

59:27.527 --> 59:29.606
I don't know why your father
picked me.

59:29.607 --> 59:33.197
- I won't be able to find the answer.
- Wait.

59:34.327 --> 59:36.446
He knows what he's doing.

59:36.447 --> 59:38.846
You'll find something.

59:38.847 --> 59:41.242
No, Mary, you will.

59:43.447 --> 59:45.438
Thanks, Sam.

59:46.367 --> 59:50.003
He's given everyone
a few hours off to recuperate.

59:50.647 --> 59:53.806
I don't have time to go to the hotel.
I'll go back to the lab.

59:53.807 --> 59:56.082
No, I...

59:56.167 --> 59:58.927
I just live a few blocks from here.

01:00:00.607 --> 01:00:02.325
OK.

01:00:26.967 --> 01:00:29.246
That wasn't very friendly.

01:00:29.247 --> 01:00:32.484
I wouldn't take it personally.
He's kind of a prima donna.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:39.126
- How about if I make a fire?
- That'd be great.

01:00:39.127 --> 01:00:41.166
Is that OK for him
to go out like that?

01:00:41.167 --> 01:00:43.881
Yeah, yeah. He comes and goes.

01:00:47.207 --> 01:00:50.046
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.

01:00:52.367 --> 01:00:54.562
She's pretty.

01:00:55.567 --> 01:00:59.157
She died about a year
after that picture was taken.

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:04.606
What was it like growing up with him?

01:01:04.607 --> 01:01:07.275
- Boot camp.
- I'll bet.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.726
Whenever he was working at home,

01:01:10.727 --> 01:01:13.999
he'd give me a quarter
for every hour I could keep quiet.

01:01:19.287 --> 01:01:24.206
One day, I remember it was...
it was a Saturday morning.

01:01:24.207 --> 01:01:26.966
I decided I wouldn't say anything
until he did,

01:01:26.967 --> 01:01:29.123
even if it took all weekend.

01:01:29.847 --> 01:01:32.845
But he never said anything.

01:01:33.207 --> 01:01:36.205
I don't think he even noticed.

01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:40.281
So how much did you make?

01:01:43.607 --> 01:01:46.041
About 12 bucks.

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:26.442
Shit.

01:02:35.487 --> 01:02:37.757
It's the old man.

01:02:55.727 --> 01:02:57.524
Yeah.

01:02:58.887 --> 01:03:00.884
Yeah, she's here with me.

01:03:05.647 --> 01:03:07.638
Yeah. OK.

01:03:09.007 --> 01:03:13.166
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just dropped the phone.

01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:17.360
Look who turned out
to be a sweetie after all.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.043
So?

01:03:28.127 --> 01:03:30.761
So we have to go back.

01:03:36.607 --> 01:03:40.720
Maybe we could stay
another... ten minutes.

01:04:12.367 --> 01:04:14.085
Don't move.

01:04:52.607 --> 01:04:54.957
Why did you do that, Sam?

01:05:02.127 --> 01:05:04.526
What's the matter, Sam?

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:07.446
Isn't this what you wanted
from the day we met?

01:05:08.047 --> 01:05:10.238
You and I together.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:29.198
You can't hurt her, can you?

01:05:31.407 --> 01:05:33.363
But I can.

01:06:28.647 --> 01:06:31.046
Mary got it off your cat? Jesus.

01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:33.446
They've taken her back to their hive,
I'm positive.

01:06:33.447 --> 01:06:37.326
If they've taken her back there,
there's nothing we can do about her.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.646
I'm going after her.

01:06:38.647 --> 01:06:40.966
No, you're not.
It's a suicide mission.

01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:42.526
You don't understand the enemy.

01:06:42.527 --> 01:06:44.606
I won't have you
on the casualty list.

01:06:44.607 --> 01:06:47.646
I have to find the hive,
get inside and get information.

01:06:47.647 --> 01:06:51.646
In 12 hours that area will be a war
zone. You're not thinking rationally.

01:06:51.647 --> 01:06:55.044
Dad, I'm sick of thinking rationally.
I'm going after her!

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.686
Do you intend to help me or not?

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.046
It's receiving OK.

01:07:11.047 --> 01:07:13.566
<i>Minneapolis has been invaded.</i>

01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:16.686
<i>Civil authorities are fighting
to keep the situation under control,</i>

01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:19.196
<i>but they are not having much luck.</i>

01:07:19.967 --> 01:07:23.364
It's good, but the frequency
still isn't matching.

01:07:24.767 --> 01:07:29.166
<i>What safeguards can be taken
to protect you and your family?</i>

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:31.526
<i>Keep your doors and windows locked.</i>

01:07:31.527 --> 01:07:35.406
<i>Don't let anyone into your home,
even if they appear to be a friend.</i>

01:07:35.407 --> 01:07:38.006
<i>If you absolutely have to
venture outside...</i>

01:07:38.007 --> 01:07:40.126
OK, can we get started?

01:07:40.127 --> 01:07:43.206
<i>Stay tuned to this station
for further updates.</i>

01:07:43.207 --> 01:07:48.246
There's some sort of a hive that
they have to go back to regularly.

01:07:48.247 --> 01:07:50.486
Central source.
Intelligence replenishing.

01:07:50.487 --> 01:07:51.715
Exactly.

01:07:51.807 --> 01:07:53.406
OK, let's run this.

01:07:54.247 --> 01:07:58.166
I've had the analysts sort through
the thermal image data we've gathered

01:07:58.167 --> 01:08:00.966
in order to plot the expansion
of the alien colony.

01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:04.126
This is a satellite picture of Iowa
when the UFO was sighted.

01:08:04.127 --> 01:08:06.636
Here. Day 1. Now watch.

01:08:07.127 --> 01:08:12.401
The orange shape represents the
spread of the colony over five days.

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:18.406
Now, what you'd expect,

01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:22.206
if it's necessary to stay close to
the hive, with Iowa's topography,

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:25.006
is that the shape would be
roughly circular.

01:08:25.006 --> 01:08:28.765
So we rationalised it
into three overlapping circles.

01:08:28.767 --> 01:08:31.117
Could you do that, please?

01:08:33.886 --> 01:08:36.203
If we shrink these circles back,

01:08:37.006 --> 01:08:39.765
we find the location of the hive
at different times.

01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:42.566
Each time the hive is on the river.

01:08:42.567 --> 01:08:45.086
That could be how they moved it.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:47.966
All right. This is where
it all started.

01:08:47.966 --> 01:08:50.680
This is where the hive is now.

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:52.599
Des Moines.

01:08:52.687 --> 01:08:56.046
Makes sense. High population density.

01:08:56.046 --> 01:08:58.363
And it'd be easier to defend.

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:07.154
We've narrowed its location to a
ten-block radius in the city centre.

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:10.286
That's where Mary is. I know it.

01:09:10.287 --> 01:09:14.639
Show me the projected size of
the colony in the next 24 hours.

01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:30.961
We'll parachute in tonight.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.125
- We have six hours.
- We'll need eight.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.676
You've got eight hours.

01:09:57.567 --> 01:10:00.926
You've got a very tight eight-hour
window to pull this off.

01:10:00.927 --> 01:10:03.126
- After that you're on your own.
- Yes.

01:10:03.127 --> 01:10:05.606
- Opening drill.
- Look, reach, pull.

01:10:05.607 --> 01:10:07.040
Good.

01:10:09.807 --> 01:10:12.002
Wait up!

01:10:14.287 --> 01:10:17.406
I just want to tell you
we jerry-rigged these transmitters

01:10:17.407 --> 01:10:20.446
so they send out
the same frequency as the aliens.

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:23.006
It's how they recognise each other.

01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:26.166
If you don't get too close,
they'll think you're one of them.

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:27.926
- Beautiful.
- Nice.

01:10:27.927 --> 01:10:29.566
- Thanks, Graves.
- Thanks.

01:10:29.567 --> 01:10:32.440
Hey, Graves, I think you're a genius,
man.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:36.246
I just want to apologise for that
comment I made back in the room.

01:10:36.247 --> 01:10:38.286
About you fucking the thing.

01:10:38.287 --> 01:10:40.326
- Let's go!
- I didn't mean it.

01:10:40.327 --> 01:10:42.846
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Good luck.

01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:47.325
<i>...choppers. We'll have to use
army vehicles and supply them here.</i>

01:10:53.647 --> 01:10:56.122
We have to cover this terrain...

01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:55.758
Danny?

01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:22.882
Somebody help!

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.360
Forget it, Alex.

01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:29.400
No!

01:12:35.327 --> 01:12:37.806
Jesus, I don't wanna end up
like that.

01:12:37.807 --> 01:12:40.567
- Trapped inside my own body.
- Come on.

01:12:48.967 --> 01:12:51.078
He wants to merge.

01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.446
Remind me to thank Graves.

01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:07.006
<i>The president's announcement has sent
shock waves throughout the country.</i>

01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:09.526
They should be at the city centre
now, sir.

01:13:09.527 --> 01:13:12.646
<i>... have been filtering in
from virtually every state.</i>

01:13:12.647 --> 01:13:17.086
<i>In response, the president has
declared a state of emergency,</i>

01:13:17.087 --> 01:13:20.606
<i>instituting martial law
in all major urban centres.</i>

01:13:20.607 --> 01:13:23.799
<i>In related news,
the financial world...</i>

01:13:50.887 --> 01:13:55.766
<i>All units designated primary
and secondary to proceed to level P2.</i>

01:13:55.767 --> 01:13:59.198
<i>All other units
should assemble on the first floor.</i>

01:14:00.447 --> 01:14:03.719
- This has to be it.
- Let's go around back.

01:14:20.647 --> 01:14:22.519
It's down there.

01:14:30.927 --> 01:14:34.358
- I should be going with you.
- Just give me 20 minutes.

01:14:37.407 --> 01:14:39.518
How will I know it's really you?

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:42.762
If it's not, you know what to do.

01:16:22.647 --> 01:16:26.840
<i>Share information... with the others.</i>

01:16:31.807 --> 01:16:36.406
<i>Sam, why are they here?
What do they want?</i>

01:16:36.407 --> 01:16:39.326
<i>My thoughts, my fears.</i>

01:16:39.327 --> 01:16:40.919
<i>My memories.</i>

01:16:41.007 --> 01:16:43.926
<i>You won't be lonely
when you're one of us.</i>

01:16:43.927 --> 01:16:47.199
<i>No-one will be.</i>

01:16:59.367 --> 01:17:03.162
<i>It's everything
you try to hide from yourself.</i>

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:09.086
<i>Isn't this what you always wanted?</i>

01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:14.166
<i>You wouldn't need the fantasies
that life was just about you.</i>

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:16.756
<i>You and I, together.</i>

01:17:19.447 --> 01:17:21.006
<i>You can't hurt her, can you?</i>

01:17:21.007 --> 01:17:23.086
<i>- It's not on him.
- Get it off me!</i>

01:17:23.087 --> 01:17:25.078
<i>But I can.</i>

01:17:25.167 --> 01:17:27.756
<i>Get it off me!</i>

01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:25.797
Don't move, don't move.

01:18:55.047 --> 01:18:56.446
Fuck.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:06.916
You all right?

01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:10.756
There's something you've gotta see.
It's important, Sam.

01:19:23.367 --> 01:19:25.244
Wait.

01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:29.483
Stay close to me.

01:19:33.927 --> 01:19:36.595
This is why they wanted me.

01:19:41.127 --> 01:19:44.399
Jesus, Mary, what is this place?

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.844
While we've been studying them,
they've been studying us.

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:53.761
More dead bodies. Great.
Can we get out of here?

01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:56.238
He's alive!

01:19:56.327 --> 01:19:58.563
Get him out of there!

01:20:00.247 --> 01:20:04.599
This is what we want. Something
killed the parasite but not the boy.

01:20:27.127 --> 01:20:28.526
Why did it die?

01:20:29.447 --> 01:20:33.166
He must have contracted
something fatal to his parasite.

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:36.526
He was sealed off in here
so he wouldn't infect the others.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:38.722
This is it.

01:20:40.287 --> 01:20:41.766
Come on.

01:20:56.967 --> 01:20:59.362
That's Alex. Take the kid.

01:21:21.927 --> 01:21:24.687
Alex! I got him! Let's go!

01:21:47.007 --> 01:21:48.645
Help!

01:21:59.527 --> 01:22:02.685
Come on!
We can't help him. Come on.

01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:14.319
Come on.

01:22:26.447 --> 01:22:28.842
You gotta get up on the roof. Go.

01:22:35.567 --> 01:22:37.917
This'll keep them busy.

01:22:49.207 --> 01:22:53.195
<i>Code eight. All units to South Plaza.</i>

01:22:54.207 --> 01:22:56.682
Main power supply.

01:22:58.527 --> 01:23:01.082
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

01:23:02.087 --> 01:23:03.845
Do you think you can walk?

01:23:04.527 --> 01:23:06.797
They'll pick us up on the roof.

01:23:13.967 --> 01:23:16.162
They're coming.

01:23:16.247 --> 01:23:17.475
Go!

01:23:18.447 --> 01:23:20.597
Come on!

01:23:39.407 --> 01:23:41.802
- Take the kid.
- OK. I got him.

01:24:13.487 --> 01:24:17.043
You weren't planning on leaving
without me, were you, buddy?

01:24:24.607 --> 01:24:27.046
Go. Get him to the roof.

01:24:27.047 --> 01:24:29.044
Let's talk about it, Alex.

01:24:31.367 --> 01:24:33.558
Here, kitty-kitty.

01:24:40.967 --> 01:24:43.237
I'll talk to you, Sam.

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:05.759
I know you're in here.

01:25:09.047 --> 01:25:14.446
If I have to look for you too long,
it's gonna really piss me off.

01:25:36.847 --> 01:25:39.326
Where are you,
you lousy son of a bitch?

01:25:39.327 --> 01:25:41.802
You said you'd help me.

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:45.117
You're no better than your father.

01:25:49.367 --> 01:25:52.040
Help me!

01:25:53.927 --> 01:25:55.804
God!

01:25:58.247 --> 01:25:59.839
Come on!

01:26:01.487 --> 01:26:03.766
- Alex, man, fight it!
- Yaaagh!

01:26:03.767 --> 01:26:05.726
Fight it, man! Fight it!

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.997
How could he, Sam? You couldn't.

01:26:10.007 --> 01:26:11.725
Don't leave me!

01:26:11.807 --> 01:26:14.766
- Please, Sam, get it off!
- Alex?

01:26:14.767 --> 01:26:17.037
- Alex!
- Get it off!

01:26:18.727 --> 01:26:21.282
Not very smart, are you, Sam?

01:26:25.207 --> 01:26:27.366
Pick him up. Bring him here.

01:26:27.367 --> 01:26:29.876
It's safe. Come on!

01:26:30.847 --> 01:26:32.878
Where are the others?

01:26:54.007 --> 01:26:56.277
You never did have a right hand.

01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:58.286
Come here.

01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:33.486
We gotta go. Where's Holland?

01:27:33.487 --> 01:27:35.564
He didn't make it.

01:27:47.447 --> 01:27:49.956
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:27:51.407 --> 01:27:54.201
Get Nivens on the radio.

01:28:04.327 --> 01:28:08.846
The boy has encephalitis, which
causes inflammation of the brain.

01:28:08.847 --> 01:28:12.166
It's not fatal to humans
if it's treated in a few days,

01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:14.926
but the aliens are 60%% brain matter,

01:28:14.927 --> 01:28:18.486
so it should kill them first,
allowing us to save the host.

01:28:18.487 --> 01:28:21.926
- How long has it been?
- 33 minutes.

01:28:21.927 --> 01:28:25.486
There's still the question of disease
vectors. How it would spread.

01:28:25.487 --> 01:28:26.886
Mosquitoes.

01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:28.036
Yes.

01:28:28.127 --> 01:28:30.277
Mosquitoes.

01:28:30.367 --> 01:28:35.595
We could release infected batches
over the areas controlled by aliens.

01:28:36.127 --> 01:28:37.958
Wait.

01:28:41.847 --> 01:28:44.156
Jesus.

01:28:44.247 --> 01:28:46.483
It's disgusting.

01:28:47.367 --> 01:28:51.086
33 minutes, 18 seconds.
That's it. We've done it.

01:28:51.087 --> 01:28:54.286
Yes, but how do we get to them all?
They've spread so far.

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:57.286
We don't need to.
There's only one alien.

01:28:57.287 --> 01:29:02.166
We've been thinking of millions. It's
one creature with a million parts.

01:29:02.167 --> 01:29:03.926
The same way
they transmit information,

01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:06.606
they'll transmit the disease.

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:10.606
A chain reaction. We can infect
the colony as if it were one body.

01:29:10.607 --> 01:29:12.438
Perfect.

01:29:21.087 --> 01:29:24.279
We've got General Morgan
coming in from Fort Riley.

01:29:28.967 --> 01:29:31.362
Bring the camera over here, please.

01:29:31.767 --> 01:29:34.083
Well, we're all clean, sir.

01:29:34.647 --> 01:29:36.246
It seems to be working.

01:29:36.247 --> 01:29:40.286
The medics are administering
the antitoxin throughout the area.

01:29:40.287 --> 01:29:44.275
Most of my men are sick as hell,
but the aliens are dying.

01:30:32.807 --> 01:30:36.158
O1 to P3. All clear.

01:30:38.527 --> 01:30:40.404
Anything?

01:30:43.207 --> 01:30:45.084
Yes.

01:30:45.647 --> 01:30:47.966
Yeah. They're on their way down?
Good.

01:30:47.967 --> 01:30:50.556
All clear down here.

01:31:26.847 --> 01:31:29.720
What were they trying to do here?

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:35.206
Rebuild their home.

01:31:36.647 --> 01:31:38.603
Careful, sir.

01:32:15.247 --> 01:32:17.238
My God!

01:32:37.327 --> 01:32:40.087
Everybody OK down there?

01:32:44.167 --> 01:32:46.835
Soldier, down here.

01:32:47.767 --> 01:32:48.643
You OK?

01:32:48.727 --> 01:32:53.286
I'm fine. Sorry. It was silly of me.
I should have been more careful.

01:32:53.287 --> 01:32:55.366
Check him out, please.

01:32:55.367 --> 01:32:56.436
He's clean.

01:32:56.527 --> 01:32:58.966
- Sorry, sir...
- No, please don't apologise.

01:32:58.967 --> 01:33:01.486
We'll need to take samples
of the structure.

01:33:01.487 --> 01:33:03.886
It's a pity we couldn't save it.

01:33:03.887 --> 01:33:06.166
What we might have learned...

01:33:06.167 --> 01:33:08.526
Well, I've seen enough.

01:33:08.527 --> 01:33:10.279
Thank you.

01:33:25.247 --> 01:33:29.360
I don't think I would have believed
it was really over.

01:33:37.327 --> 01:33:38.123
How you doing?

01:33:38.207 --> 01:33:40.326
I can't believe
I slept for two days.

01:33:40.327 --> 01:33:43.200
Excuse me, sir.
Dr Nivens forgot his cane.

01:33:43.767 --> 01:33:45.726
Give me a hand up.

01:33:45.727 --> 01:33:48.157
- There you go.
- Thanks very much.

01:33:53.247 --> 01:33:55.442
Thank you.

01:34:20.567 --> 01:34:24.686
Come on, soldier. On the double.

01:34:24.687 --> 01:34:25.802
Move!

01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:36.440
Call in emergency services now.

01:34:49.047 --> 01:34:51.038
Hello, Sam.

01:34:54.687 --> 01:34:57.606
I can fly a helicopter.

01:35:00.887 --> 01:35:02.115
Perfectly.

01:35:08.607 --> 01:35:10.766
You never told me how good it felt.

01:35:10.767 --> 01:35:14.206
I had no idea man could feel
such a sense of freedom.

01:35:14.207 --> 01:35:16.726
- My God!
- When did you take him?

01:35:16.727 --> 01:35:19.806
- Back in the ship.
- We checked.

01:35:19.807 --> 01:35:24.006
I explained we had to lower
my body temperature, so we did.

01:35:24.007 --> 01:35:27.916
- We learn from our mistakes.
- I want you to land this helicopter.

01:35:28.487 --> 01:35:29.761
Or what?

01:35:30.407 --> 01:35:32.716
A gun.

01:35:34.087 --> 01:35:36.323
Automatic pilot.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.726
What are you going to do?

01:35:41.727 --> 01:35:46.478
Do you think that you are capable
of killing your father?

01:35:47.127 --> 01:35:49.246
He'd want me to.

01:35:49.247 --> 01:35:50.805
Possibly.

01:35:50.887 --> 01:35:54.841
But the question is, can you?

01:36:04.327 --> 01:36:05.521
Give me...

01:36:30.927 --> 01:36:34.358
But you can't win.

01:36:48.407 --> 01:36:49.726
Give it up.

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:15.401
Stand back.

01:38:15.487 --> 01:38:18.440
You guys come with me.

01:38:22.207 --> 01:38:24.084
Dad?

01:38:24.167 --> 01:38:26.726
Come on, man. Don't do this to me.

01:38:26.727 --> 01:38:29.166
Don't do this to me! Dad!

01:38:29.167 --> 01:38:32.926
Stop shouting, Sam, for God's sake.
You know how much I hate it.

01:38:32.927 --> 01:38:36.358
I got it. I got it.

01:38:41.247 --> 01:38:44.606
I can't believe you actually shot me.

01:38:44.607 --> 01:38:46.086
What would you have done?

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:48.526
I would have shot you, of course,
but...

01:38:48.527 --> 01:38:51.321
I never dreamed
you were that kind of man.

01:38:54.367 --> 01:38:57.206
Get outta here, Sam. I'm fine.

01:38:57.847 --> 01:39:01.286
- It's OK, I'm going with you.
- No. Take her for a cup of coffee.

01:39:01.287 --> 01:39:04.126
Exercise a fantasy.

01:39:04.727 --> 01:39:05.796
OK, Dad.

01:39:10.287 --> 01:39:12.955
That was the last one.

01:39:14.887 --> 01:39:17.078
You don't know that.

01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:21.241
- Yes, I do.
- Excuse me.

01:39:29.447 --> 01:39:31.717
Have a good time.

01:39:40.927 --> 01:39:43.606
I guess you exobiologists
finally earned your keep.

01:39:43.607 --> 01:39:45.325
Yeah, I guess.

01:39:53.567 --> 01:39:55.966
When I was inside that thing,

01:39:55.967 --> 01:39:59.637
it was like hearing a thousand voices
inside my head.

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:02.557
Yeah, I know.

01:40:04.167 --> 01:40:06.123
You were there.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:11.080
Your memories, your thoughts,
feelings.

01:40:12.727 --> 01:40:15.600
Everything you try to hide
from yourself.

01:40:18.127 --> 01:40:20.197
Yeah.

01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:39.006
I guess you know how I feel
about you, then.

01:40:42.367 --> 01:40:45.161
Down to the last gory detail.

01:40:46.447 --> 01:40:50.046
- Gives you an unfair advantage.
- Why's that?

01:40:50.047 --> 01:40:53.086
It would take me forever
to learn that much about you.

01:40:53.087 --> 01:40:55.486
No, I think actually it helps us.

01:40:55.487 --> 01:40:58.406
If you look at it
from a sociological point of view,

01:40:58.407 --> 01:41:02.286
you could argue that men take a lot
longer to open up than women do.

01:41:02.287 --> 01:41:07.402
So you should be right on track
in about 40 or 50 years.
