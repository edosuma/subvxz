00:20.555 --> 00:22.306
We meet again, Dodomeki.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.045
It is time for us to go

00:24.070 --> 00:27.065
on the really big quest. Together.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.640
Yes, Kuchi Kopi.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.632
We're finding that, um,

00:30.657 --> 00:32.758
that amulet and it won't be easy.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.153
So here we go.

00:34.203 --> 00:37.083
-Pew!
-Wait, why'd you make that sound?

00:37.163 --> 00:39.953
Oh, never mind, I don't know.
Pretend I didn't do that.

00:39.978 --> 00:42.108
Well, that's impossible.
It was really distracting

00:42.133 --> 00:43.973
and kind of forced, or something.

00:43.998 --> 00:46.763
Sorry, it's just hard to get
into this for some reason.

00:46.788 --> 00:48.168
It's fine, we're fine.

00:48.193 --> 00:49.563
Let's just do the thing.

00:49.588 --> 00:51.032
- Hey, Louise. You okay?
- Huh?

00:51.057 --> 00:52.357
What? Yeah.

00:52.382 --> 00:54.064
Of course I'm okay, I'm great.

00:54.089 --> 00:55.929
This is going great.

00:55.954 --> 00:57.868
Okay, well, time for breakfast.

00:57.893 --> 00:59.193
Mom's exact words were,

00:59.218 --> 01:00.736
"Guess what time it is. Egg thirty."

01:00.761 --> 01:02.470
Um, unless I'm interrupting.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.955
Uh, no, I was just wrapping up.

01:05.117 --> 01:06.733
- So, we're having eggs?
- No.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.968
- Oh.
- But yeah, it's egg thirty.

01:09.153 --> 01:12.558
Okay, kids. I packed you an
extra delicious exotic lunch

01:12.583 --> 01:14.275
for your field trip today.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.928
It's chunky peanut butter, huh?

01:16.953 --> 01:18.283
Ooh la la.

01:18.308 --> 01:20.068
Louise, you excited?

01:20.093 --> 01:22.133
Your first time going to
the marionette theater.

01:22.158 --> 01:24.568
Easy, Mom. You're setting
Louise up for disappointment.

01:24.593 --> 01:27.025
What? I thought you loved that place.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.673
It's the greatest show on strings.

01:28.698 --> 01:30.986
Eh... not the greatest, actually.

01:31.011 --> 01:33.223
It's the same not-so-great
show every year.

01:33.248 --> 01:35.498
No matter how bored you
are, don't fall asleep.

01:35.523 --> 01:37.443
The puppets follow you into your dreams!

01:37.468 --> 01:40.368
No, it's fun. Remember, Bob?

01:40.393 --> 01:42.763
We took Gene and Tina
there when they were little?

01:42.788 --> 01:44.328
- It's great, right?
- Uh, it's bad.

01:44.353 --> 01:46.023
- It was a bad day.
- Bob.

01:46.048 --> 01:48.337
What? It was long and
boring and made me want

01:48.362 --> 01:50.037
to stop supporting the arts and start

01:50.062 --> 01:51.942
actively working against them.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.177
I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:53.202 --> 01:54.718
Anything's better than being at school.

01:54.793 --> 01:56.373
I mean, you'd think so...

01:56.424 --> 01:58.594
Aw, you're all a bunch
of puppet poopers.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.199
I wish I was a marionette.

02:00.224 --> 02:01.764
Someone doing all the work for me,

02:01.789 --> 02:03.919
moving my arms and legs around.

02:03.944 --> 02:06.078
Wah, wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah...

02:06.103 --> 02:07.409
Well, there's your beautiful bride, Dad.

02:07.434 --> 02:09.604
- Ah, you get what you get.
- Wah, wah, wah...

02:09.839 --> 02:11.209
Okay.

02:11.234 --> 02:12.814
For those of you who haven't been

02:12.839 --> 02:15.514
to the Esther Margaret
Marionette-Odeum,

02:15.539 --> 02:16.749
here's the rundown.

02:16.774 --> 02:19.654
We start the day with
a glorious puppet show.

02:20.329 --> 02:22.864
Was hoping for a little more
reaction there, but okay.

02:22.889 --> 02:25.389
Next, there's a
puppet-building workshop.

02:25.414 --> 02:27.579
- And finally, you'll perform...
- Whoo, yeah!

02:27.604 --> 02:30.439
- Uh, a bit late on that, Zeke.
- Oh, got it.

02:30.464 --> 02:32.704
I'll get it next time. Keep
doing what you're doing.

02:32.729 --> 02:34.229
Uh, uh, okay.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.164
Anyway, then you'll
break off into groups

02:36.189 --> 02:39.109
and perform your own
puppet show for each other.

02:39.134 --> 02:41.174
Anything to add, Ms. Labonz?

02:41.199 --> 02:42.739
Don't bring me into this.

02:42.764 --> 02:46.079
Oh, okay. Uh, let's go inside.

02:46.104 --> 02:48.464
Well, let's just get
through this, right, Zeke?

02:48.489 --> 02:50.254
If I die of boredom, tell my story.

02:50.279 --> 02:51.579
You know I will.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.974
Oh, come on. It's a puppet show.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.459
It can't be that bad.

02:55.484 --> 02:57.040
♪ Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp ♪

02:57.064 --> 02:58.394
♪ Stamp, stamp, stamp ♪

02:58.419 --> 03:01.089
♪ And that's a song about stamps. ♪

03:01.114 --> 03:02.534
Oh, my God.

03:02.559 --> 03:04.994
Well, hello there. I'm Stampson.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.954
And as you can see, I've been to
some pretty interesting places.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.269
I guess you could say
that I really like stamps.

03:10.294 --> 03:11.914
But who doesn't?

03:12.004 --> 03:14.544
Does anyone here know
where I could find a stamp?

03:14.569 --> 03:16.739
Is that Ron the health inspector?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.609
- Oh, yeah.
- Did he get arrested?

03:18.634 --> 03:20.244
Is this community service?

03:20.269 --> 03:23.109
Look, a box. And it's lost.

03:23.134 --> 03:25.424
Hey, everyone. Which way to Milwaukee?

03:25.449 --> 03:27.869
We'll tell you, but first, you need a...

03:27.894 --> 03:30.828
♪ Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp,
stamp, stamp, stamp... ♪

03:30.853 --> 03:33.184
Dear Lord, make me a
bird so I can fly far.

03:33.209 --> 03:35.459
Far, far away from here.

03:35.484 --> 03:37.774
Huh.

03:37.814 --> 03:39.724
- Lin, look at this guy.
- Oh.

03:39.749 --> 03:42.339
What's he doing? What's he wearing?

03:42.364 --> 03:43.974
- Great show, it's a rave.
- Hi.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.299
Uh, can I help you?

03:45.324 --> 03:47.164
Can I help you?

03:47.349 --> 03:49.843
Supercala-Rave-A-Glowstick?

03:49.868 --> 03:53.254
Mm-hmm. Thursdays are 18-plus
rave nights at the Dance Hole.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.850
- Dubstep, trip-trance.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Right.

03:54.874 --> 03:56.874
- Electro-hop, doo-wop-hop.
- Yeah, right. Right, I-I got it.

03:56.899 --> 03:59.109
- Polynesian speed gospel.
- I got it. Sir, I got it.

03:59.134 --> 04:02.374
Um, can I ask you if you
wouldn't mind not flyering here?

04:02.399 --> 04:04.149
I mean, flyers are
great, but you're kind of

04:04.174 --> 04:05.673
standing right in
front of my restaurant.

04:05.698 --> 04:07.305
- Oh, uh, my bad.
- Thanks.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.974
- But I can't move.
- What? W-Why?

04:10.104 --> 04:12.711
My boss told me to flyer
right here in this spot.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.829
And he said he's gonna
come by and check on me.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.194
And if I'm not in this
exact spot, I won't get paid.

04:17.219 --> 04:20.168
Well, that seems ridiculous.
Just move 20 feet that way.

04:20.194 --> 04:23.379
- I'm sure he won't care.
- He was very specific, okay?

04:23.404 --> 04:25.274
I can't risk it. I need the money

04:25.299 --> 04:26.969
for this little dude's medical bills.

04:26.994 --> 04:28.390
- Is that a...
- It's a ferret.

04:28.414 --> 04:29.664
My ferret, Karat.

04:29.689 --> 04:31.599
- Okay...
- He's really old,

04:31.624 --> 04:33.284
but he's still got a lot of spunk.

04:33.309 --> 04:34.849
- Check it.
- Oh, wow.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.624
H-He's okay with being put in a shoe?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.634
He likes it. It's where
he goes to the bathroom.

04:38.674 --> 04:39.794
It's my roommate's shoe.

04:39.939 --> 04:41.649
- Ride the rave.
- No, no, no. No.

04:41.674 --> 04:43.804
Don't cross the street.
He-he won't give you a flyer.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.884
- He was just leaving.
- I have to give 'em a flyer.

04:45.924 --> 04:47.884
Bob, what's going on out here?

04:47.909 --> 04:49.909
Apparently, this guy
needs to hand out flyers

04:49.934 --> 04:51.224
right in front of the restaurant.

04:51.319 --> 04:53.369
Can't you just move
half a block up that way?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.724
-I just gave him the same suggestion.
-Yeah, he already said

04:55.749 --> 04:57.039
that exact thing. I can't.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.034
Well, should we just
pick him up and move him?

04:59.059 --> 05:00.939
You mean, like, each take a side?

05:00.964 --> 05:02.854
Don't do that. I'll make myself heavy.

05:02.879 --> 05:04.129
- Look.
- Oh, yeah.

05:04.154 --> 05:05.364
- Look at that.
- Hmm.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.899
Okay, students. Quiet down.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.534
Let's give a big hand to the woman

05:08.559 --> 05:12.149
who made this all possible,
Ms. Esther Margaret!

05:12.174 --> 05:13.969
Hello, children.

05:13.994 --> 05:16.494
Welcome back to the place
where imagination comes

05:16.519 --> 05:18.359
with strings attached.

05:20.044 --> 05:22.384
So, find a spot on the floor.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.659
It's time to build your
own marionette magic.

05:24.684 --> 05:28.134
Any questions, just ask one
of our seasoned volunteers.

05:28.159 --> 05:29.909
Wait, is this it?

05:29.934 --> 05:32.394
She just wants us to
put stickers on these?

05:32.434 --> 05:33.894
They stay if you press really hard.

05:33.974 --> 05:36.104
If only that were true
of men, huh, sister?

05:36.129 --> 05:38.289
- Is there a problem here?
- Um, no.

05:38.314 --> 05:39.814
- It just seems kind of...
- What?

05:39.894 --> 05:41.354
You don't like building puppets?

05:41.444 --> 05:43.564
I mean, if that's what
you're calling this.

05:43.589 --> 05:45.799
- Ron. This one needs help.
- Yeah?

05:45.824 --> 05:47.154
Oh, so, uh...

05:47.179 --> 05:49.024
Uh, one might want
to put a sticker here.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.379
O-Or maybe here.

05:50.404 --> 05:52.784
Ron, I know how stickers work.

05:52.809 --> 05:54.309
- Brag.
- You know what?

05:54.351 --> 05:55.641
Where's the bathroom?

05:55.666 --> 05:57.809
Uh, it's down the hall, to the left.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.204
Great, thanks.

05:59.294 --> 06:01.964
Ugh, the kids get worse
and worse every year.

06:01.989 --> 06:04.159
- But people keep making them.
- What?

06:04.184 --> 06:08.064
I don't need help. You need help, lady.

06:09.684 --> 06:10.764
Huh?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.483
Uh, that room's off-limits.

06:14.604 --> 06:15.944
What was that puppet?

06:16.064 --> 06:18.784
-It's, uh...
-None of your business is what it is.

06:18.809 --> 06:20.634
Now go do your business.

06:20.659 --> 06:22.829
If you haven't done it
in your diapers already.

06:22.854 --> 06:24.840
Easy, lady. If you don't
want us to go in that room,

06:24.864 --> 06:27.834
you should have... Oh,
now I'm seeing the sign.

06:27.859 --> 06:29.574
I was just thinking, little girl.

06:29.599 --> 06:31.509
- Louise.
- Uh-huh.

06:31.534 --> 06:34.574
Since the puppet workshop
isn't holding your attention,

06:34.599 --> 06:37.889
I'm assigning you with a
very special job all your own.

06:37.914 --> 06:40.269
- How's that sound?
- Judging by your tone,

06:40.294 --> 06:42.248
- it sounds...
- That was a rhetorical question.

06:42.273 --> 06:43.773
Come with me.

06:44.109 --> 06:45.859
This is our tech booth.

06:45.884 --> 06:48.804
Usually smells like whatever
weird thing Dot's eating.

06:48.924 --> 06:50.344
That's me. Hi.

06:50.384 --> 06:51.554
Dot, I thought you could use

06:51.579 --> 06:53.379
an extra helper in the booth today.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.829
- This is Loosie.
- Louise.

06:55.854 --> 06:58.114
- No one's named "Loosie."
- I must've heard wrong.

06:58.139 --> 07:00.019
Anyway, you two have fun.

07:00.144 --> 07:02.484
- See you at showtime.
- Wait, wait, wait...

07:02.524 --> 07:04.734
- Dried fish skin?
- What? No.

07:04.814 --> 07:06.104
Sorry, I chew with my mouth open

07:06.129 --> 07:07.565
'cause I can't breathe through my nose.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.192
Oh.

07:09.217 --> 07:11.507
- Sorry.
- Great.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.604
Well, welcome to master control.

07:16.629 --> 07:19.219
So, am I here as punishment?

07:19.244 --> 07:21.584
I don't know. Wait. Am I?

07:21.639 --> 07:24.937
Oh, wow. Anyway, well, yeah,
let me give you the tour.

07:24.962 --> 07:27.964
Well, there's the master
tape deck, cassette library,

07:27.989 --> 07:30.329
fog machine, sound mixer and, uh...

07:30.354 --> 07:31.630
- that's the lighting board.
- What?

07:31.655 --> 07:34.365
- That one switch?
- Yeah, it's got a dimmer.

07:34.594 --> 07:36.094
Well, tour's over.

07:36.119 --> 07:37.909
Are you good or should I do it again?

07:37.934 --> 07:39.304
Oh! I got a flashlight.

07:39.329 --> 07:42.079
Now we're cooking, huh?

07:42.184 --> 07:44.814
- What's taking Louise so long?
- If Dad's taught us one thing,

07:44.839 --> 07:46.209
it's not to comment on how long

07:46.234 --> 07:47.460
someone's taking in the bathroom.

07:47.484 --> 07:49.234
Your sister's been reassigned

07:49.274 --> 07:51.824
- to the tech booth with Dot.
- What? Oh, no.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.194
The Tech Booth with Dot?

07:53.219 --> 07:54.759
I hate that podcast.

07:55.009 --> 07:56.929
Hey, while we're waiting
for the shows to start,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.114
want to listen to my beats?

07:58.204 --> 07:59.624
I've been making beats on my phone.

07:59.704 --> 08:01.874
- I mean...
- Check it out. I call this one

08:01.899 --> 08:04.189
"Can I Sell My Bed On Craigslist?"

08:06.199 --> 08:09.039
That's... a-a funky beat.

08:09.064 --> 08:11.859
I keep asking Esther if we can
use one of my beats in the show,

08:11.884 --> 08:13.804
but I'm starting to think
that'll never happen.

08:13.829 --> 08:15.289
Well, that's her loss, Dot.

08:15.314 --> 08:17.359
Hey, what can you tell
me about that cool puppet

08:17.384 --> 08:19.054
in the "do not enter" room?

08:19.079 --> 08:20.989
You know, the one with
all the shiny colors

08:21.014 --> 08:23.684
- and the arms and... ?
- Oh, that's Vladikus.

08:23.774 --> 08:26.064
Don't let Esther catch
you looking at that puppet.

08:26.104 --> 08:28.474
Too late. What's the deal?

08:28.499 --> 08:30.919
Is she jealous she can't make
something
