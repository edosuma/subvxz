WEBVTT

00:17.059 --> 00:18.643
When will the stew be ready?

00:18.811 --> 00:20.269
It'll be ready when it's ready.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.689
A good meal takes time.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.023
Hungry now.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.983
You're always hungry.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.610
Ain't my problem.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.655
My problem's your cooking.
You ever gonna make anything edible?

00:32.116 --> 00:35.868
When are you gonna act like a man,
instead of sitting here whining?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.915
Looks like shit.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.174
Tastes like it too.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.135
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.554
-How does it feel?
-What's that supposed to mean?

01:02.479 --> 01:04.397
Get off me!

01:33.135 --> 01:34.552
What are you doing here?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.888
Trying to stay warm.

01:37.055 --> 01:40.099
Don't these coasties know
how to keep a fracking fire going?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.477
-Aren't you--?
-Dead?

01:42.644 --> 01:46.230
Checked out? Taking the old dirt nap?

01:47.483 --> 01:50.276
Don't look at me.
You're the one dreaming this up.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.617
Dig the beard.

01:57.785 --> 02:01.037
Very anti-establishment,
screw the man and all that...

02:01.205 --> 02:04.040
...but I gotta ask.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.252
-What are you trying to prove?
-Maybe I just like the way it looks.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.505
Makes you look like one
of the Village People.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.926
What the hell are you
really doing here, Alan?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
I'm trying to stop Ilaria.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.306
By traipsing through the forest
with a bunch of sailors?

02:20.474 --> 02:24.727
Not to mention this Kyle guy, who's trying
to get your butt thrown in federal prison.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.980
Ilaria have come up
with a new pathogen.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.609
-I'm not sure why, but--
-Horse shit.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.779
You and I both know that ain't
the real reason you're out here.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.864
Of course it is.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.991
Humor me.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.619
First, you were trying to save Julia.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.997
Then you were hunting a bunch
of immortals in Paris.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.376
And now you're trying to find a cure
for this pathogen.

02:48.544 --> 02:51.337
Seems to me like you're a man
in search of a mission.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.966
-I know why I'm here, Doreen.
-Oh, I don't think you do.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.592
And you need to wake up.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.969
You hear me?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.096
Wake up, Alan.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.681
Wake up.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.932
Alan, wake up.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.518
Keep at it, I'll put that boot up your ass.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.312
I just figured you might want
to stay with the gang here.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.981
But sleep till noon if you want.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.776
-Look, we don't have to get along--
-We don't get along, doc.

03:13.944 --> 03:17.029
But we're in this together, like it or not,
so let's get it done.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.447
You get a head count?

03:18.615 --> 03:21.701
Okay, take three men. Maintain
visual contact. Check the perimeter.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.244
-Yes, ma'am.
-What's happening?

03:23.412 --> 03:26.205
-One of our guys hasn't reported in.
-You're with me.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.623
Must have just overslept.

03:33.005 --> 03:38.342
I know you've been
through unspeakable horror.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.220
The loss of friends and loved ones.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.390
But I can promise you, we will prevail.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.350
Say it with me.

03:46.977 --> 03:51.105
We will prevail.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.942
When will it be safe
for us to eat or drink?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.861
Dr. Farragut has assured me...

03:57.029 --> 04:00.406
...that our remaining food
and water supplies are uncompromised.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.991
Why did Michael lie to us?

04:02.159 --> 04:06.954
-Why did he kill everyone?
-What Michael did was a terrible mistake.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.916
You're all safe now. The CDC--

04:10.083 --> 04:12.793
Michael said the CDC was here
to keep us safe.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.630
-But they brought the sickness.
-No.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.924
That's absolutely not true.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.801
Lies and more lies.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.936
Michael, who called himself our brother...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.688
...fell prey to the evil words
of the outsiders...

04:32.856 --> 04:36.067
...and now my mother
is following his path.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.363
-How dare you speak to me that way.
-I will speak to you any way I like!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.908
We're no longer afraid
of you and Michael.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.661
For years we leaned on tradition...

04:46.828 --> 04:48.663
...went about our work...

04:48.830 --> 04:50.289
...and reassured ourselves:

04:50.457 --> 04:55.586
The old ways are the safest ways,
the surest ways.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.547
But we have been led down
a path to ruin.

04:59.591 --> 05:05.221
Whole families lost to sickness or poison.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.264
The old ways are dead.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.434
The time has come to move on.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.314
To open ourselves
to our new incarnation.

05:15.482 --> 05:19.986
Skeptics and outsiders have done
their best to destroy us.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.530
And Anne has embraced them.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.615
Even laying with one of them.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.788
That's not true.

05:30.956 --> 05:35.960
They misled my mother and Michael,
but they shall not mislead us.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.923
Come, join me.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.929
Anne? Anne.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.187
Your daughter has Michael's gift
for empty speech.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.774
Not only empty, but cruel.

06:39.941 --> 06:44.111
I'm sorry she singled you out.
It was unforgivable.

06:44.279 --> 06:48.115
-You don't need to apologize for Amy.
-Why not? I'm her mother.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.910
Her failure is my failure.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.203
That's not true.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.790
You have to stop blaming yourself
for everything that goes on here.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.835
I've spent my life doing exactly
what I've been told.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.672
No one ever listened to me except
when I repeated what Michael said.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.343
If I disagreed, I was yelled at.

07:07.511 --> 07:12.723
But I put up with it
because I believed in him.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.562
Two days ago in the oubliette,
you yelled at me.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.899
Anne, I'm sorry.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.736
No, it's fine.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.281
The point is, I yelled back.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.829
I felt safe with you.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.883
You were right, and you listened.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.301
You listened.

07:51.054 --> 07:55.015
The survivors of the thinning
aren't the only ones in need of a savior.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.187
What are you gonna do?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.233
I'm not going down without a fight.

08:04.401 --> 08:09.405
Amy may think she has control
of the Abbey, but I have--

08:11.992 --> 08:13.909
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.912
I haven't had a chance to get up here
since I was trapped.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.248
There must be
a hundred new messages.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.751
They're here.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.296
-They're already here on the island.
-Who's here?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.256
The answer to our problem.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.526
I thought you said
this hike was an hour tops.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.405
An hour as the crow flies.
We could've taken the Ilaria chopper.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.033
Not without raising a dozen red flags.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.784
We need to get in, find Michael...

08:55.952 --> 08:58.454
...and the infertility biotech quickly
and quietly.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.748
And what if Michael doesn't want
to cooperate?

09:00.916 --> 09:02.458
Then we reason with him.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.796
I haven't heard from Peter in five days.
Who knows what we're walking into?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.674
I don't want to use force
unless it's absolutely necessary.

09:14.930 --> 09:15.971
It might be.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.463
Dr. Jordan,
I thought I might find you here.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.799
The curious scientist.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.510
Is this some kind of game to you,
you crazy bitch?

09:55.845 --> 09:56.887
Language.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.808
Do I need to have Landry wash
your mouth out with soap?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.908
You know, I am willing
to give you a trade...

10:18.785 --> 10:20.786
...if you give me what I want.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.540
I can't make you immortal.
I've never done the procedure.

10:24.708 --> 10:29.545
"Can't"? "Never"?
Those are self-defeating words.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.841
That's just the kind of negative thinking
that could lead to a terrible accident.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.509
Stop it.

10:40.598 --> 10:46.228
How long do you think
the child could live outside the jar?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.272
-What are you--? Don't--
-Five minutes?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.816
-Don't. Stop it.
-Two?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.735
Okay, wait, wait.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.488
I'll do it. Whatever you want.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.826
I thought you might see the light.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.251
Lieutenant commander, we found him.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.676
Oh, my God.

11:33.068 --> 11:38.072
You're no doubt wondering
how exactly our little organism survives.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.785
When Michael decided to raise children
separately from their parents...

11:42.952 --> 11:45.537
...he naturally encountered resistance.

11:45.705 --> 11:50.542
So he tried separating babies
and mothers pre-birth.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.795
But how to keep the babies alive?

11:52.962 --> 11:57.132
Well, he devised a neutral environment,
a synthetic womb...

11:57.300 --> 12:02.721
...in which babies could gestate
without all those...

12:02.889 --> 12:04.932
...troublesome emotional attachments.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.517
You people are insane.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.477
And your opinion is noted.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.729
Anyway, it didn't work.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.608
They lived a few weeks,
which isn't bad...

12:14.776 --> 12:19.029
...but ultimately a dead end.

12:21.491 --> 12:26.620
You see, he could only use the jar
for a baby that never grew.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.957
One frozen in its development.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.585
As if it were immortal.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.046
Don't. Don't.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.256
Don't do that.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.718
Look, I don't care about you
or your little tadpole.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.179
Tell me how you became an immortal.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.810
I was dying.

12:49.978 --> 12:53.188
And I received an infusion of spinal fluid
from another immortal.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.190
-Sounds dangerous.
-It can be.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.443
Especially if the fluid is from one of us.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.584
When I was a little, I used to watch
my father standing here...

13:13.751 --> 13:17.296
...supervising his followers
in the orchard.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.757
Even then...

13:21.718 --> 13:25.345
...I thought maybe one day
I would take his place.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.349
And now I'm here.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.227
But it's not enough.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.606
I imagine there's never enough
for people like you.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.276
I want everything he had.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.738
His world and his eternity.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.873
Make me immortal
and you will get your child back.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.351
So do we have a deal?

14:14.604 --> 14:17.189
Good. We'll do it today.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.859
I can't do a spinal tap on myself.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.863
-Alan can do it later.
-I'm not waiting.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.990
Who do you expect
to do the procedure? You?

14:27.158 --> 14:30.160
-Why not me?
-Because you're not a doctor.

14:30.328 --> 14:33.580
If you make a mistake,
you could leave me paralyzed.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.750
Please, just let me talk to Peter.

14:37.418 --> 14:42.214
Peter is off playing nursemaid
to my poor mother.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.007
No.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.468
I want immortality today.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.738
It's latched from the inside.
No way to get through.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.450
Or over. Unless you want
to get lit up like a Christmas tree.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.828
So you're telling me there's no way in.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.872
Could try knocking.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.766
Julia.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.560
-Sergio.
-Don't "Sergio" me.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.395
Why haven't you returned
my messages?

16:21.189 --> 16:24.733
-It's a long story.
-Don't have time for this.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.069
I need to talk to somebody
named Michael.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.030
-He's gone missing.
-Then who's in charge?

16:31.574 --> 16:33.408
My name is Anne.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.411
You arrive at a time of some change.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.456
But you are welcome.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.314
Whoever took out our guy is gonna
try again. Pick us off one at a time.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.526
Keep your head on a swivel.
Teams of two, no wandering off.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.654
Yes, ma'am. Listen up, teams of two.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.490
Fan out from here and sweep east.

17:13.658 --> 17:14.991
Seen this before.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.702
When we first arrived.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.453
Any idea what it means?

17:18.621 --> 17:19.955
Trail marker, maybe?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.373
Yeah, it's a trail marker.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.250
You have a better theory?

17:23.418 --> 17:25.252
Yeah, there are crazies out here saying:

17:25.420 --> 17:29.548
-"Go back wherever you came from."
-Can you two cut the chatter?

17:31.509 --> 17:34.010
Form up, form up!

17:34.971 --> 17:37.305
You heard the commander, form up!
Move, move!

17:41.144 --> 17:42.686
Soren?

17:44.522 --> 17:47.399
Jesus. Are you okay?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.942
What happened to your eye?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.528
-I'm sorry, Dr. Kyle.
-For what?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
Are you aware
of the Ilaria Corporation?

18:03.624 --> 18:05.250
The name is unfamiliar to me.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.627
In four days, they're going
to launch a virus...

18:07.795 --> 18:10.547
...which will decimate a large percentage
of the population.

18:10.715 --> 18:11.965
Up to five billion deaths.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.010
-Narvik?
-A new strain. Narvik-C.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.472
It's self-replicating. It'll spread
in a matter of weeks, if not days.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.931
I don't see how we can help.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.641
Please don't waste my time.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.061
I know about Michael's infertility
experiments. I want the bio-tech.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.521
Why should I give it to you?

18:26.689 --> 18:30.358
Ilaria's unconcerned about how we slow
population growth, just that it happens.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.237
-If I can show them another way--
-Using our infertility grafts?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.865
Better that than slaughtering
billions of people.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.076
-This is an outside world problem.
-It's a whole world problem.

18:40.244 --> 18:44.289
If they release the new Narvik,
no one is safe. Not even on an island.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.709
I'm asking for your help.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.294
There's no need to lie.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.505
You're not asking.

18:51.672 --> 18:57.219
Your man is prepared to shoot me
if I refuse.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.929
Isn't that right?

19:08.439 --> 19:10.232
You don't have it, do you?

19:11.943 --> 19:14.653
-It's in a safe place.
-No.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.113
If you knew where it was,
you'd be taking bids.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.033
I know Anne.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.202
And I know this abbey.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.371
I can get you what you want.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.498
For a price?

19:27.208 --> 19:28.416
What do you want, Peter?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.545
Guaranteed immunity from Ilaria
when all this is over.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.879
Done.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.841
And a finder's fee.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.467
Nine figures.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.344
You want 100 million dollars?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.806
To prevent five billion deaths,
you're getting a bargain.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.559
You're a pig.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.520
And pigs get fed.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.539
There's an indentation
in between the third and fourth vertebrae.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.502
-Got it.
-Angle the needle upward.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.921
Insert the needle, half an inch.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.715
Very slowly.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.010
I don't know that I'd let anyone do this
to me without anesthesia.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.846
I can't tell you what to do
if I'm taking a nap.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.563
Did I mention to do it slowly?

20:34.859 --> 20:36.109
It's not going in.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.820
The resistance is a membrane
with fluid.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.782
Push a fraction of an inch.
This part is crucial.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.994
Any further and you could damage
my spinal cord.

20:48.789 --> 20:49.956
Nothing's happening.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.918
-Take it out!
-What's going on?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.962
You missed. You're in the nerve.
You're in the nerve tissue.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.256
-What should I do?
-Take it out, damn it!

21:01.802 --> 21:03.303
You'll have to start over again.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.975
You know, this isn't easy for me either.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.364
Good.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.283
You're awake.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.578
So we get to see those pretty eyes.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.581
-Where am I?
-You're a guest in our home.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.168
See? I even brought you supper.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.970
What we need on this island is salt.

21:46.347 --> 21:49.516
-Did you bring any salt?
-Sorry, fresh out.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.896
Try some.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.857
Smells great, but I'm not hungry.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.527
I see.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.655
You're too good to eat at my table?

22:05.866 --> 22:07.325
Got one of the good bits.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.705
The eyes are the best part.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.289
Really, I couldn't.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.211
Well, that's it.
I said I'd look after you...

22:18.379 --> 22:21.256
...but if you're gonna bad-mouth
my cooking....

22:27.847 --> 22:29.889
What do you think you're doing?!

22:32.560 --> 22:34.185
I was just looking at his eyes.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.979
You stay away from him.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.445
Look at you.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.613
You're nowhere near ready.

22:46.574 --> 22:50.201
You're skinnier
than one of them island rabbits.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.974
-Nothing.
-Trail's gone cold.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.643
-Wait here.
-What do you got?

23:15.811 --> 23:19.773
-Any sign of Dr. Sommer?
-Trail disappears up the ridge.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.942
There's no sign of anything
within a quarter-mile radius.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.112
We're going back to the Abbey.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.363
No. No.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.742
-We leave him out here, he's dead.
-He's probably dead already.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.079
Look, Winger, we're on the verge
of finding a possible cure...

23:34.246 --> 23:37.624
...to maybe the world's worst pathogen.
I'm not going back without it.

23:37.792 --> 23:41.419
The men assigned to my command
are not special forces, but they're men.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.005
That guy hanging in the tree
was one of their own.

23:44.173 --> 23:48.384
Look, the only reason we were attacked
is because we're getting closer.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.013
I'm sorry, but your man in the tree
can't get any more dead than he is.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.015
We keep searching.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.176
Jeez, that could've left a mark.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.344
You're still here?

24:31.512 --> 24:34.931
Someone's gotta knock some sense
in that thick head of yours.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.434
Guess the big log didn't do the trick.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.688
Do me a favor. If you have
a point to make, make it.

24:41.856 --> 24:44.149
Don't get all snippy on me.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.526
I'm just wondering
if you figured it out yet.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.028
-I'm afraid to ask.
-Then I'll ask for you.

24:49.780 --> 24:54.450
What is it about this Kyle fellow
that's got you so hot under the collar?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.203
Nothing, I told you.
I'm trying to stop Ilaria.

24:57.371 --> 25:01.958
Ilaria this, Ilaria that. You're starting
to sound like a broken record.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.918
What do you want from me, Doreen?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.837
The truth, for starters.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.757
You and I both know saving the kid
doesn't amount to a hill of beans...

25:09.925 --> 25:11.551
...as far as Ilaria is concerned.

25:11.719 --> 25:15.346
If the shoe was on the other foot,
he'd be halfway back to Seattle by now.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.473
No. He believes in what he's doing.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.810
-How's that?
-He's young. He's reckless.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.605
But he's not going
through the motions.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.231
He really believes it.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.984
Now we're getting somewhere.

25:28.152 --> 25:32.197
Doreen, you know exactly
why I can't leave Kyle out here.

25:32.740 --> 25:37.911
Yeah, well he's as stubborn as you
and doesn't back down from a fight.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.997
He may even look a bit like you
if you shave the damn beard.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.958
Oh, and you may want to take care
of that head wound.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.003
They bleed like a son of a bitch.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.213
What head wound?

25:49.131 --> 25:51.674
Hey. You still here, doc?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.595
I think so.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.514
Lucky you're still in one piece.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.352
What happened?

26:02.519 --> 26:03.561
Booby trap.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.313
We are getting close.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.235
Closer than you think.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.529
I doubt
the Mycotics are into Juicy Fruit.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.918
It worked. I did it.

26:32.633 --> 26:35.843
Now we transfer it to a clean syringe...

26:36.011 --> 26:39.097
...and when you're ready,
we reverse the procedure...

26:39.265 --> 26:41.724
...and inject it into your spine.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.602
What's wrong?
This was what you wanted.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.229
I'm not sure I trust you.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.149
-I trusted you.
-What choice did you have?

26:50.317 --> 26:52.986
I want my child back.
I held up my end of the bargain.

26:53.445 --> 26:57.448
And I will hold up mine, as soon as
I know you're not going to try anything.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.244
You want immortality,
this is the only way.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.496
Maybe we can try it on a rabbit.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.624
-A test.
-It doesn't work like that.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.211
I'll do it.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.255
What?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.219
Don't be ridiculous.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.887
I'm not.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.140
You can try it on me first.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.392
Why would you risk that?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.602
She could be poisoning you.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.730
Then I'll die.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.609
But I get to protect you,
and if it works...

27:33.777 --> 27:36.279
...then I get to be immortal too.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.781
We could be together forever.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.202
Fine.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.581
Try it on him first.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.210
-That wasn't part of the deal.
-It is now.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.921
If you ever want to see your son again.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.076
Hey. Can I get a drink of water?

28:23.869 --> 28:28.373
Look, I'm sorry about the stew thing,
but I'm dying of thirst.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.795
Soren.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.047
I'm sorry, Dr. Kyle.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.383
-For what?
-Tricking you into coming here.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.010
Well, you didn't really trick me.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.097
Plus, the big guy
did the heavy work anyway.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.808
-What you got there?
-It's from the bleeding tree.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.310
-The bleeding tree?
-Yeah.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.646
We eat it so we don't get more sick.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.944
Soren, do you know
what Cadmus and Carol do?

28:58.112 --> 28:59.946
You know how
they get their food, right?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.782
Yeah. They trap people.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.410
And eat them.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.328
That's right.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.039
But I don't want to be on the menu.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.793
If I help you, they'll eat the rest of me.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.130
What do you mean,
"eat the rest of you"?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.342
Soren, listen...

29:21.510 --> 29:23.678
...I promise
I won't let them hurt you anymore.

29:23.846 --> 29:26.681
-You can't.
-No. I can't while I'm tied up here.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.182
-I need you to be brave.
-No.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.600
-Please.
-No.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.519
Soren, please.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.160
Hey.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.747
What's going on here?

29:58.130 --> 30:00.756
How many days before
you can give the procedure to Amy?

30:00.924 --> 30:04.886
Another three to four days before
I can donate any more spinal fluid.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.889
You hear that, Amy?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.974
I wish we could do it together,
right now.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.809
Me too.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.271
But we're going to be immortal together,
so, what's a few more days?

30:17.900 --> 30:21.110
-What's the holdup?
-I'm waiting for the anesthetic to kick in.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.988
Get it over with.

30:24.865 --> 30:27.158
Unless you have some reason not to.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.830
Okay, you might feel
a slight amount of pressure.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.177
I don't feel any different.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.443
Help me. Hold him down.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.696
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.616
I've heard of patients
who can reject a CSF infusion.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.826
I've heard of doctors
who poison patients.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.078
I didn't do anything.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.121
Yes, you did.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.669
You just said goodbye to your baby.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.541
-What's wrong?
-There are no seeds.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.085
-Of course not.
-But we need seeds to plant trees.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.088
-That's the point of this whole mission.
-We don't need seeds.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.300
We graft all our trees
from the original rootstock.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.052
-We call her Mother.
-Her?

32:10.220 --> 32:12.638
Michael discovered Mother
quite by accident...

32:12.806 --> 32:15.558
...when the orchard was suffering
from a terrible blight.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.768
Only one tree survived...

32:17.936 --> 32:21.355
...absorbing the fungus
rather than being consumed by it.

32:21.523 --> 32:25.943
Later, Michael discovered
a curious effect in the fruit.

32:26.111 --> 32:29.405
It made the mortal men
who ate it unable to father children.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.824
So all of this was created by accident?

32:32.659 --> 32:35.995
Many of humanity's
greatest discoveries were accidental.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.873
Penicillin, quinine, insulin.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.959
-Why not Mother?
-I'd like to see her.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.423
Of course.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.773
First you won't eat my cooking...

33:03.940 --> 33:06.484
...then you want to leave
without saying goodbye.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.402
Yeah, where are my manners?

33:09.029 --> 33:12.365
You're a funny one.
Lucky, Caddie didn't catch you first.

33:14.284 --> 33:20.748
Sometimes he lets the rabbits run
just so he can have a good chase.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.460
Says it tenderizes the meat.

33:25.587 --> 33:29.382
Only trouble is,
when he catches them...

33:30.092 --> 33:33.344
...he eats the eyes all to himself.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.349
But we'll definitely be sharing yours.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.479
Blue's my favorite color.

33:43.647 --> 33:44.980
Tastes great with honey.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.817
You eat the honey?

33:47.984 --> 33:49.610
Of course we do.

33:51.113 --> 33:53.030
-Isn't that dangerous?
-No.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.658
I keep a jar of it all to myself.

33:56.702 --> 33:57.952
Don't tell Caddie.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.042
That's-- That's funny.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.461
He said the same thing about you.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.424
-What's that?
-I probably shouldn't say anything.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.467
Cadmus swore me to secrecy.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.137
He did, did he?

34:16.304 --> 34:17.847
Cross my heart and hope to die.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.890
What'd he say?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.311
Don't worry, you can trust me.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.900
I'd like to, but you've seen how
Cadmus gets when he's angry.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.694
I can get angry too.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.533
You tell me, little rabbit.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.495
All right, all right. But you gotta
promise not to say anything.

34:41.663 --> 34:45.708
It's just, he wants both of my eyes
for himself.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.169
Son of a bitch, I knew it!

34:48.336 --> 34:50.713
Please. Don't tell him I told you.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.632
Some days, I think I could kill him.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.678
That's a good idea.
Then you could eat his eyes.

35:00.474 --> 35:02.767
What do you think we are, savages?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.145
-We don't eat our own.
-Why not?

35:06.313 --> 35:07.563
Because it's wrong.

35:08.523 --> 35:12.526
And the disease makes the meat rotten.
Everyone knows that.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.537
We've taken extraordinary precautions
where Mother is concerned.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.791
Nothing at the Abbey
is more important.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.507
-No.
-What's wrong?

35:35.383 --> 35:37.343
She's gone.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.678
Mother is gone.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.357
All right.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.820
Come on, you can do this.
Come on, come on.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.834
-No.
-What's this now?

36:12.921 --> 36:15.047
What happened to you?

36:15.465 --> 36:17.049
I can't say.

36:17.759 --> 36:21.095
Come on, now. You tell me or I'll
give you something to bleed about.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.680
-Who did that?
-No. No.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.098
No, Carol will get angry.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.143
Carol. She knows better.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.187
She said
she wanted them all to herself.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.692
-What are you talking about?
-My eyes.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.236
She wanted to take my eyes,
but I wouldn't let her.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.947
-She did what?!
-Said she didn't care what you thought.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.116
I told her you'd get angry.
She didn't care.

36:42.284 --> 36:43.742
That bitch!

36:44.786 --> 36:47.496
Never should've left her
with fresh meat!

36:49.416 --> 36:53.711
Where the hell are you, woman?
What have I told you about....

37:20.614 --> 37:22.990
Quickly, woman. The meat's gone!

37:27.871 --> 37:29.038
Gonna get you!

37:33.376 --> 37:36.045
Run, rabbit, run!

37:39.925 --> 37:42.092
Useless rabbit.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.930
Share his eyes, Caddie.
Share them.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.572
You're gonna get it, rabbit.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.213
-Hello, rabbit.
-Hold on. Hold on now.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.465
Share his eyes, Caddie. Share them.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.926
Enough, woman. You're cooked.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.345
You all don't eat your own,
Carol told me.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.472
So what? You're clean.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.349
Not anymore.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.437
I ate all of it, now I'm sick just like you.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.735
You just ruined my meal.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.320
Yeah, I'm real sorry about that.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.656
Oh, you think
you just saved yourself, do you?

39:27.824 --> 39:29.158
No.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.499
No, no.

39:44.424 --> 39:45.883
Clear!

39:46.342 --> 39:49.011
Check the perimeter!
See if there are any more of them!

39:49.179 --> 39:50.721
-No more Mycotics.
-Yes, sir.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.140
-Let's go!
-Just the boy, Soren.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.435
-You hurt?
-I'm all right.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.481
-For two more days, at least.
-What are you talking about?

40:01.733 --> 40:05.319
We'd better find that damn tree,
or I'm a dead man.
