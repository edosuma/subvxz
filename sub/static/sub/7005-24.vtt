00:01.300 --> 00:04.803
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

00:04.804 --> 00:06.805
Binford tools
is proud to present

00:06.806 --> 00:10.742
Tim "the tool man" taylor!
Woo-woo!

00:13.112 --> 00:16.014
Thank you!

00:16.015 --> 00:19.584
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.786
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:21.787 --> 00:23.488
And you know
my assistant, al...

00:23.489 --> 00:25.957
<i>(metal banging)</i>
"metal head" borland.

00:28.727 --> 00:31.897
Welcome to metal week
right here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:31.898 --> 00:35.000
This week we invited my old
high school shop teacher along.

00:35.001 --> 00:38.469
The maestro of metal.
The sultan of steel.

00:38.470 --> 00:41.239
Ooh, good.
The earl of...

00:45.311 --> 00:48.880
Er-luminum.

00:48.881 --> 00:50.949
Let's give him
a warm welcome out here.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.218
Mr. Art leonard,
come on!

00:55.555 --> 00:57.889
Hey, timmy.
How're you?

00:59.592 --> 01:02.561
It's exciting
to have you here.
Thank you.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.830
What was your reaction
when I said you were
coming back on <i>tool time?</i>

01:05.831 --> 01:07.999
Fear.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.701
Don't worry.
That'll go away...

01:10.702 --> 01:12.703
Once you're unconscious.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.942
Tell everyone what
we'll do this week.
Oh, sure. Ok.

01:17.943 --> 01:19.810
First I'll show you
how to frame with steel.

01:19.811 --> 01:22.180
Then how to install
aluminum gutters,

01:22.181 --> 01:24.582
And then we'll talk about
flashing on your roof.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.822
Which is better than where
he usually does it -
out there in the street.

01:30.823 --> 01:34.693
Do you remember when you used to
make cracks like that in class?

01:34.694 --> 01:36.161
Yeah. Yeah.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.996
You used to give me
that "shut up and wait
in the hall" look.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.305
Is he looking
at me right now?

01:49.575 --> 01:52.744
Ok, I'll stand in the hall.
Oh, come on.
Get back here.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.847
When I was in school, I never
spoke until I was called on.

01:55.848 --> 01:59.451
Did I call on you?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.119
No.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.521
Let's start
with the gutters.

02:03.522 --> 02:06.224
I've cut these pieces with
an old-fashioned hack saw.

02:06.225 --> 02:10.794
Right. Now we can attach
the gutters to our fascia
board using this bad boy.

02:10.795 --> 02:15.833
The binford c02-powered
nail gun. Oh, yeah!

02:15.834 --> 02:20.805
This will shoot a thousand
eight-penny nails,
galvanized, in an hour.

02:20.806 --> 02:22.607
All right.
Hold your horses!

02:22.608 --> 02:26.444
No, mr. Bond.
You hold your horses.

02:26.445 --> 02:29.146
First we have to
pop-rivet the joints.

02:29.147 --> 02:32.317
Now, the rivets will
not be complete until
they're actually...

02:32.318 --> 02:35.353
Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh-ho!

02:37.823 --> 02:41.459
You shot mr. Leonard
in the butt?
Yes.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.962
That's exactly why you shouldn't
play around with a nail gun!

02:44.963 --> 02:48.132
I'm trained in first aid.
I'll need a claw hammer,
a vacuum hose,

02:48.133 --> 02:50.635
Some band-aids and a magnet.

03:41.153 --> 03:45.189
Mom, someone's gotta take
that perfume away from grandma.
The upstairs reeks.

03:45.190 --> 03:47.925
She wants to smell pretty
for her date with mr. Leonard.

03:47.926 --> 03:51.529
Grandma's going out on a date?
Isn't she a little old for that?

03:51.530 --> 03:55.400
Brad, your social life
doesn't end just because
you're a senior citizen.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.002
I guess you'll find out
in a couple years.

04:01.607 --> 04:03.908
You do know that
the oldest son

04:03.909 --> 04:06.511
Has to feed
and bathe his mother.

04:10.382 --> 04:11.949
Gross!

04:13.486 --> 04:16.553
The whole upstairs stinks!

04:16.555 --> 04:18.623
It's just your
mother's perfume.

04:18.624 --> 04:21.760
Why do you women think
that we want you
to smell like flowers?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.129
What do you want us
to smell like?

04:24.130 --> 04:27.666
Cigars.

04:27.667 --> 04:32.202
If you want to attract a man,
spray on a little
essence of stogie.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.306
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

04:38.177 --> 04:40.178
Hey, mr. Leonard.
Come on in. Have a seat.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.517
I only wish I could.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.885
Still a little tender
in that area, huh?

04:47.886 --> 04:51.956
I got shot in the butt in korea,
it didn't hurt this much.

04:51.957 --> 04:56.294
So, I hear you've been seeing
quite a lot of lucille lately.

04:56.295 --> 05:00.030
Oh, yeah. I went up
last month and we drove into
gaylord for her birthday.

05:00.031 --> 05:02.533
Oh, I'm so sorry
I'm late. Oh, art!

05:02.534 --> 05:04.268
Hey, beautiful!

05:07.840 --> 05:11.676
My gosh! You're as pretty as
a peach in a little red wagon.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.914
How come you never say
stuff like that to me?

05:15.915 --> 05:18.482
I didn't even
understand it.

05:18.483 --> 05:20.719
We'll see you
guys later.
Bye-bye.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.153
Have a good time.
<i>(tim)</i> bye.

05:25.190 --> 05:28.425
They are so adorable.
Yeah, but...

05:28.426 --> 05:31.562
Didn't that kiss seem
a little long to you?

05:33.064 --> 05:35.132
They were just
saying hello.
No, no, no.

05:35.133 --> 05:39.737
That was not hello.
That was <i>hello!</i>

05:39.738 --> 05:42.139
Come on, tim. You know
they're seeing each other.

05:42.140 --> 05:45.676
I thought they were
seeing each other like
old people see each other.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.112
Eating dinner at 4:30,

05:50.416 --> 05:53.752
Watchin' <i>matlock.</i>

05:53.753 --> 05:56.720
They're old, tim,
they're not dead.

05:56.721 --> 05:59.490
You're not suggesting
that they...

05:59.491 --> 06:01.492
They might be.
Oh, no.

06:04.029 --> 06:07.965
Just because they're older
doesn't mean they don't have
the same urges we have.

06:07.966 --> 06:10.502
This is an area
I don't want to discuss, ok?

06:10.503 --> 06:12.871
Tim, you are an adult.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.341
You should be able to think of
your mother as a sexual being.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.642
<i>(winces)</i>

06:30.722 --> 06:32.790
Why are you
all dressed up?

06:32.791 --> 06:35.293
'cause I'm taking mom out
to a real nice restaurant.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.461
What'd you do this time?

06:39.865 --> 06:42.901
Nothing!
That bad?

06:42.902 --> 06:46.137
You guys have no idea what it
takes to make a good marriage.

06:46.138 --> 06:48.806
How could we?

06:51.743 --> 06:54.279
You don't take your wife out
after you've screwed up.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.115
Sometimes you take her out
before you screw up.

06:58.116 --> 07:01.553
That way you build up credit
for stupid things you haven't
done yet.

07:01.554 --> 07:05.289
So, it's kind of like getting
frequent screw-up miles.

07:07.025 --> 07:09.593
I like that.

07:09.594 --> 07:12.130
Hi, grandma.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.400
You're going out to dinner.
Why are you eating
right before you go?

07:15.401 --> 07:18.936
Jill lets me.

07:18.937 --> 07:22.740
Tim, how many times
have I told you not to eat
before we go out to dinner?

07:22.741 --> 07:25.243
Mom lets me.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.612
Thanks for staying
with the boys, lucille.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.813
Happy to do it.
We'll be back around ten.

07:29.814 --> 07:33.551
Take your time.
And be sure and mention
art's name at sorentino's.

07:33.552 --> 07:36.120
He really made an impression
with the owner.

07:36.121 --> 07:38.556
He certainly has made
an impression on you.

07:38.557 --> 07:41.960
Oh, jill.
Oh, lucille.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.829
It's just that art
has such a zest for life.

07:44.830 --> 07:47.965
He makes me happy in a way
that I never thought
I could be again.

07:47.966 --> 07:50.701
I'm so glad for you.

07:50.702 --> 07:53.971
You know, mom, whatever
you and art are doing -
which I don't want to know...

07:56.508 --> 07:59.443
I'm happy.
I really
appreciate that, tim.

07:59.444 --> 08:03.414
You know, it's just
too bad that you couldn't
have dated him in high school.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.716
I'd have gotten
better grades.

08:05.717 --> 08:10.321
Come to think of it,
you should have dated my
math and english teachers.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.156
Your math teacher
was a woman.

08:12.157 --> 08:17.095
If you loved me,
that wouldn't have made
any difference, would it?

08:17.096 --> 08:21.198
We don't usually let
our babysitters have
boyfriends over -

08:21.199 --> 08:23.401
But for mr. Leonard
we'd make an exception.

08:23.402 --> 08:27.271
Oh, that's ok, honey.
I think he needs to spend
some time with his daughter.

08:27.272 --> 08:31.175
Besides, I don't want to
monopolize all of art's time.

08:31.176 --> 08:34.878
Tim, stop eating
the crackers.
I'm not!

08:34.879 --> 08:36.880
All right.
Then whistle.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.618
<i>(hums)</i>

08:50.829 --> 08:52.963
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

08:52.964 --> 08:55.265
No, taylor.
Tim taylor.

09:00.138 --> 09:04.942
It's unbelievable how many guys
think I'm this buongiorno guy.

09:04.943 --> 09:07.011
Amazing coincidence.

09:07.012 --> 09:10.148
Ah, your table is ready.
Antonio will be your waiter.
Thank you.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.016
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

09:15.153 --> 09:17.187
I must be the guy's twin.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.123
I got to go
to the ladies' room.

09:19.124 --> 09:20.892
All right.
Wash your hands.

09:23.529 --> 09:27.332
What?
I thought I was
with the boys.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.167
You don't need
to wash your hands.
Thank you.

09:32.871 --> 09:35.973
Sir, would you care
to see our wine list?

09:35.974 --> 09:37.408
You bet I would.

09:37.409 --> 09:41.946
Perhaps I can interest you
in the brunello di malticino?

09:41.947 --> 09:44.882
Is that the price per bottle
or for the vineyard?

09:46.918 --> 09:50.288
Perhaps you'd be interested in
something a little more modest?

09:50.289 --> 09:53.091
Maybe with a twist-off.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.495
In that case,
may I offer you a soda?

09:57.496 --> 10:01.032
We have a root beer
that's quite amusing.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.901
And a waiter who's not.

10:03.902 --> 10:07.705
How about just
two nice glasses
of your house white?

10:07.706 --> 10:10.074
Very good, sir.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.212
Hey, mr. Leonard.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.321
Tim, what are you doing?

10:23.322 --> 10:25.122
Get down!

10:26.858 --> 10:30.495
Why?
Mr. Leonard's here
with another woman.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.730
Well, it's probably
his daughter.

10:32.731 --> 10:35.500
That would make him
195 years old.

10:39.071 --> 10:42.173
Maybe it's his sister.
They were kissing
on the lips.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.908
Lots of families
kiss on the lips.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.511
Yeah. The families
from <i>deliverance.</i>

10:53.252 --> 10:54.985
Tim, don't jump
to any conclusions.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.021
You know what kind
of man mr. Leonard is.

10:59.391 --> 11:02.693
A dirty, rotten,
two-timing rat!

11:10.635 --> 11:14.005
Would you like your wine
served in the planter?

11:17.676 --> 11:20.578
We were just admiring
the greenery.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.113
What are these called?

11:22.114 --> 11:24.681
Plants.

11:32.824 --> 11:35.326
Might I tell you about
the specials tonight?

11:35.327 --> 11:38.429
How can you think of
food at a time like this?

11:38.430 --> 11:41.699
Perhaps because
this is a restaurant?

11:41.700 --> 11:45.002
Could you just give us
a few moments, please?

11:45.003 --> 11:47.071
Very good.

11:47.072 --> 11:50.808
This is so depressing.
Tell me about it.

11:50.809 --> 11:52.877
I've looked up to that
man since I was a kid.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.778
Said those
romantic things to mom.

11:54.779 --> 11:58.248
What'd he call her?
A peach in a
little red wagon.

11:58.249 --> 12:01.786
Probably calling her a kumquat
in a little blue tractor.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.488
Here they come! Hide!
Where?

12:04.489 --> 12:06.657
Under the table!

12:23.509 --> 12:27.445
Would you like to
hear the specials now?

12:34.653 --> 12:36.721
Are you and mr. Leonard
gonna get married?

12:36.722 --> 12:40.591
Oh, I don't know. I guess
it's a possibility someday.

12:40.592 --> 12:42.660
We're not ready yet.

12:42.661 --> 12:45.863
Are you gonna live together
first, like mom and dad did?

12:49.201 --> 12:51.602
Wait a minute.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.671
Are you saying that
before they got married

12:53.672 --> 12:56.040
Your mom and dad
lived together?

12:56.041 --> 13:00.077
Oh, no, no. See, what I said is
that before they got married

13:00.078 --> 13:02.746
They loved
good weather. See?

13:06.418 --> 13:09.353
Grandma, maybe you should
get your ears checked.

13:09.354 --> 13:12.789
My hearing is just fine.

13:12.790 --> 13:15.158
How's your memory?

13:20.299 --> 13:23.400
We have got to tell her.
No, we're not
gonna tell her.

13:23.401 --> 13:26.436
Tomorrow, I'll talk
to mr. Leonard tool man
to tool man, ok?

13:26.437 --> 13:28.405
We'll pretend
nothing happened?

13:28.406 --> 13:29.774
That's how we do it
in my family.

13:29.775 --> 13:32.276
She doesn't know that
I hitchhiked to indy...

13:32.277 --> 13:35.146
Or that you and I lived together
before we were married.

13:38.716 --> 13:41.018
Hi, mom.
Hi!

13:41.019 --> 13:44.021
How'd you like
the restaurant?
Oh, it was great.

13:44.022 --> 13:45.889
You know, I didn't expect
you home so early.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.692
Maybe I'll go over to
art's and surprise him.

13:48.693 --> 13:51.161
That would surprise him.
But don't do that.

13:51.162 --> 13:53.097
Why? Do you think
he's in bed?

13:53.098 --> 13:56.033
I'd bet on it.

13:56.034 --> 13:59.403
9:30 on a Saturday night?
I'm sure he's still up.

13:59.404 --> 14:01.471
Mom, you can't go.
Why not?

14:01.472 --> 14:04.442
Because, gosh darn it!
I miss you.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.644
You should go see
art tomorrow.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.212
Ok. I guess
that can be done.

14:08.213 --> 14:10.881
Great.
Let's have coffee.
We'll talk.

14:10.882 --> 14:16.887
Ok. Why not start with
how you two lived together
before you got married?

14:17.923 --> 14:21.191
You handle that.
I'll make the coffee.

14:24.963 --> 14:28.064
It's gonna be great
having you on the show,
wilson.

14:28.065 --> 14:31.602
You know,
your sculptures
are incredible.

14:31.603 --> 14:34.472
Well, thank you, al.
Ever since I was a young lad,

14:34.473 --> 14:39.243
It was always a dream of mine
to create metal headwear.

14:40.445 --> 14:43.114
Well, ever since
I started working with tim

14:43.115 --> 14:45.650
It's been a dream of mine
to wear metal headwear.

14:45.651 --> 14:49.820
I confess I am feeling
a wee bit of stage fright.

14:51.356 --> 14:53.056
A little nervous, are you?

14:53.057 --> 14:56.460
I'm fearing I'm about
to experience reverse
peristalsis.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.064
What do you mean?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.832
I'm about to blow chowder.

15:07.839 --> 15:09.206
Where's mr. Leonard?

15:09.207 --> 15:11.308
He called to say
he's running a little late.

15:11.309 --> 15:13.410
Oh, I bet he's running late!

15:13.411 --> 15:17.180
Probably picking up babes down
at the social security office.

15:17.181 --> 15:20.184
I thought mr. Leonard
was dating your mother.
That's what I thought.

15:20.185 --> 15:24.555
Last night I saw him
kissing some other woman
in a restaurant.

15:24.556 --> 15:28.492
It seems to me that
mr. Leonard probably has
a problem with monogamy.

15:28.493 --> 15:30.460
I don't care what kind
of wood he uses.

15:33.531 --> 15:35.800
This guy's a role model,
I've looked up to him.

15:35.801 --> 15:39.803
Well, tim, I'm reminded
of what the english essayist,
samuel johnson,

15:39.804 --> 15:42.339
Said about teachers
of morality.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.775
Oftentimes
they discourse like angels.

15:44.776 --> 15:47.178
But more often,
they live like men.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.580
The only problem is
my mom's never been happier.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.482
You guys,
we're on in three minutes!

15:51.483 --> 15:55.319
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!

15:57.489 --> 16:01.058
Tim, stand away
from wilson.
Why?

16:03.762 --> 16:06.063
Don't ask.

16:06.064 --> 16:09.200
Now that we've shown you
wilson's metal sculptures...

16:09.201 --> 16:12.703
I'm spartacus.
No, I'm spartacus.

16:12.704 --> 16:17.107
I am spartacus.
Ask anybody, I'm...
No, I'm spartacus.

16:17.108 --> 16:20.978
Ok, you're spartacus.
You go ahead with
that spartacus stuff.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.613
Get whipped.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.085
Spartacus and I
will be right back
after these messages

16:28.086 --> 16:30.554
With tim's high-school
shop teacher, mr. Leonard.

16:30.555 --> 16:34.859
He's gonna show us how
to customize a mailbox,
so stay tuned.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.360
All right,
let's hurry up.
Be careful with this.

16:37.361 --> 16:40.030
Hey, timmy.
I'm sorry I'm late.

16:40.031 --> 16:43.500
Yeah. Thanks for showing up
halfway through the show.

16:43.501 --> 16:46.870
I was getting the stitches
removed from my butt.

16:46.871 --> 16:49.239
The doctor says hello.
He recognized your handiwork.

16:54.312 --> 16:57.214
We're back with mr. Leonard,
who's gonna show us his hobby.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.816
At least one of them.

17:01.553 --> 17:05.689
This is a very beautiful
mailbox. How would you
make one of these?

17:05.690 --> 17:10.227
Take a sheet of 24-gauge
half-hard aluminum and
bang it against the anvil.

17:10.228 --> 17:13.396
You have a lot of hammers
to choose from.
This here is a ballpeen.

17:13.396 --> 17:16.066
This is a bumping hammer.
Which one would you prefer?

17:16.067 --> 17:18.468
Well, actually, al,
I like to use both of them.

17:18.469 --> 17:21.638
So, one hammer's not
good enough for you?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.541
No, it isn't.
Each hammer gives you
something different.

17:24.542 --> 17:28.879
There's a lot of good solid
folks out there that think
you should pick one hammer.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.616
I think they're crazy.
Sometimes I use a rubber mallet.

17:32.617 --> 17:36.320
You'll just hammer
with anything, won't you?

17:36.321 --> 17:37.654
What the hell
are you talking about?

17:37.655 --> 17:39.456
I'm talking about
a guy I thought I knew.

17:39.457 --> 17:42.192
Not one that picks up
tools in restaurants
and makes out with 'em.

17:42.193 --> 17:44.294
What?

17:44.295 --> 17:47.064
All right. Ok. I think
it's time for another break.

17:47.065 --> 17:50.967
We'll be right back after
these messages from binford.

17:50.968 --> 17:53.036
What's the matter?
What is going on?

17:53.037 --> 17:55.739
I got a bone to pick
with mr. Leonard.
Let's hear it.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.876
We have an audience.
Pick your bones backstage.

18:03.448 --> 18:06.083
All right. What's your
problem with me, kid?

18:06.084 --> 18:09.420
I saw you at sorentino's
last night with another woman.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.756
Oh, boy!
Yeah. I saw everything.

18:12.757 --> 18:15.492
Flowers, the kiss.

18:15.493 --> 18:18.929
I'll be honest with you.
I'm dating another woman.
Her name is florence.

18:18.930 --> 18:22.199
How can you do this to mom?
She told me you made her happy.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.835
I feel the same
about your mother.
What about florence?

18:24.836 --> 18:27.938
I wanted to break it off
with her. I took her
to dinner to say goodbye.

18:27.939 --> 18:29.739
That's not what
it looked like.

18:29.740 --> 18:33.143
I kept saying goodbye,
and she kept saying hello.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.847
My mom is real
serious about you.

18:36.848 --> 18:42.352
Tim, I was married
for 42 years.

18:42.353 --> 18:45.756
After my wife died,
I never thought
I'd date again.

18:45.757 --> 18:49.192
And then about three months ago,
I met two terrific women.

18:49.193 --> 18:51.161
I really liked
the both of them.

18:51.162 --> 18:54.364
I guess I went
a little overboard.

18:54.365 --> 18:57.234
Figure out who you're saying
hello and goodbye to.

18:57.235 --> 19:01.572
We're on in three seconds.
Are you two finished,
or should I do it by myself?

19:01.573 --> 19:03.840
If you do it by yourself,
we're all finished. Come on!

19:07.312 --> 19:09.213
We're back with mr. Leonard

19:09.214 --> 19:13.116
Who's now gonna choose
between a ballpeen hammer
and a bumping hammer,

19:13.117 --> 19:15.752
Remembering how close he is
to the son of the ballpeen.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.929
What do you think
he's saying to her?
I don't know.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.265
Will he stop seeing
that other woman?
I don't know.

19:28.266 --> 19:31.235
Will he commit
to your mother?
I don't know.

19:31.236 --> 19:36.005
How can you have
a conversation with
this man and know nothing?

19:36.006 --> 19:38.576
I don't know.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.977
That's the difference
between you and me.

19:40.978 --> 19:44.281
I don't pry
into people's lives.

19:44.282 --> 19:47.817
Well, neither do I.

19:47.818 --> 19:50.287
God, I wish we'd put
that intercom switch on
downstairs!

19:51.456 --> 19:53.657
I did.
Just turn the volume up.

19:55.559 --> 19:59.262
You know, I... I've thought
a lot about our relationship.

19:59.263 --> 20:01.865
I have too.
Oh, ok.

20:01.866 --> 20:04.968
You want to go steady?
Sounds good to me.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.973
Does that mean you won't
be seeing that other woman?

20:09.974 --> 20:11.742
Oh, boy! I wasn't
that obvious, was I?

20:11.743 --> 20:16.179
No. It was tim and jill.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.850
They were acting so idiotic last
night I knew something was up.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.755
That is all over.

20:24.756 --> 20:28.458
I've also given a great
deal of thought about my
priorities in life.

20:28.459 --> 20:32.963
You're right at the top.
Right after my arthritis pills.

20:32.964 --> 20:38.568
You're at the top of my list,
too. After my bunion pads.

20:38.569 --> 20:42.873
Boy, are we gonna be
a lovely pair, walking hand
in hand into the pharmacy.

20:47.779 --> 20:51.047
So, where do we
go from here?
I don't know.

20:51.048 --> 20:55.653
But at our age
we had better go fast.
Art!

20:55.654 --> 21:01.158
You're prettier than
a blushing apricot
in a little wicker basket.

21:01.159 --> 21:04.862
I love it when you
talk fruit to me.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.998
Isn't that sweet?

21:07.999 --> 21:10.433
He sure knows his produce.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.076
What do you think
they're doing now?

21:19.077 --> 21:22.379
It's pretty quiet.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.480
<i>(tim) hey, mr. Leonard!</i>

21:28.920 --> 21:30.820
The food here
is actually quite good.

21:30.821 --> 21:34.124
Yeah. We finally
got to enjoy the food.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.627
Thank you, honey.
You're welcome.

21:36.628 --> 21:40.497
May I interest you
in some dessert?
Ooh, we'd love dessert.

21:40.498 --> 21:42.866
We have a delicious
crème brûlée.

21:42.867 --> 21:45.402
I don't believe this guy!

21:45.403 --> 21:48.037
All right,
it's a little bland.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.877
But the chocolate mousse
is excellent.

21:53.878 --> 21:56.580
You can't believe
a word the man says.

21:56.581 --> 22:01.418
All right.
The lemon tart.
I swear by it.

22:01.419 --> 22:04.621
Excuse me.

22:04.622 --> 22:07.024
Hey, art.
Well, hello, timmy.

22:07.025 --> 22:10.093
What the heck's
going on here?
Careful, tim.

22:10.094 --> 22:12.730
She's half your age, buddy!
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

22:12.731 --> 22:16.366
I'd like you
to meet my daughter.

22:16.367 --> 22:19.469
Well, of course
it's your daughter.
She's half your age.

22:19.470 --> 22:23.507
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'll slip back to my table
and finish my other foot.

22:45.563 --> 22:48.398
Interesting.
Very interesting.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.700
But stupid.
