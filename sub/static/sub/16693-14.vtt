(Male announcer)
Tonight on <i>Kitchen Nightmares,</i>

00:03.557 --> 00:05.090
Chef Ramsay heads
to the Prohibition Grille

00:05.192 --> 00:08.728
- in Everett, Washington...
- You are kidding me.

00:08.796 --> 00:11.831
(Announcer) ...where he meets an
owner making all the wrong moves.

00:11.932 --> 00:14.733
(Gordon) Belly dance?
That was a belly flop.

00:14.834 --> 00:18.136
(Announcer) Rishi Brown went from
belly dancer to restaurant owner.

00:18.237 --> 00:20.472
I thought "fresh" means
that it's not frozen.

00:20.573 --> 00:22.774
Fuck me.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.209
(Announcer)
And her lack of experience...

00:24.377 --> 00:26.077
I don't know anything about
what goes on back there.

00:26.178 --> 00:27.512
(Announcer)
...is evident everywhere.

00:27.613 --> 00:29.214
(Gordon) Oh, my God.

00:29.315 --> 00:31.515
The meat's cooked and raw
on the same shelf.

00:31.616 --> 00:34.752
(Announcer) She's oblivious to what
is happening in her kitchen...

00:34.853 --> 00:35.953
Rishi is a little bit naive.

00:36.054 --> 00:38.188
She just sort of trusts Rocky.

00:38.256 --> 00:41.158
(Announcer) As her lazy chef
cooks up one disaster...

00:41.259 --> 00:42.993
- When was that cooked?
(Announcer) - ...after another.

00:43.094 --> 00:45.195
[Coughing] It's sour.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.897
(Announcer) But in spite of all
the obvious shortcomings....

00:47.998 --> 00:50.233
I can't help you
one minute longer.

00:50.334 --> 00:52.635
(Announcer)
...this owner remains in denial.

00:52.737 --> 00:55.638
- I think the food is great here.
- What?

00:55.740 --> 00:57.974
(Announcer) It's one of the most
frustrating situations ever

00:58.075 --> 00:59.275
on <i>Kitchen Nightmares.</i>

00:59.377 --> 01:01.477
Is anyone shitting for real here,
or is this a joke?

01:01.578 --> 01:04.111
(Announcer) This owner may have
asked for Chef Ramsay's help...

01:04.212 --> 01:06.515
I can't sit here and take
this shit any longer.

01:06.616 --> 01:09.618
(Announcer) But doesn't seem
too interested in taking it.

01:09.719 --> 01:13.655
[Crying] I'm so scared.

01:13.757 --> 01:16.057
[Aggressive surf music]

01:16.158 --> 01:17.658
What is that?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.894
You're serving rotten food.

01:19.995 --> 01:21.496
- You could possibly kill them.
- Then wake up!

01:21.597 --> 01:22.497
You wake up!
[Coughs]

01:22.598 --> 01:25.500
- Shut the place down.
- Get out of here!

01:25.601 --> 01:27.134
<i>(Gordon) That is amazing.</i>

01:27.235 --> 01:28.736
I can't take any more.

01:28.837 --> 01:30.581
Thank you, Chef.

01:34.776 --> 01:38.779
(Announcer) Everett, Washington,
25 miles north of Seattle.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.115
This blue-collar town is home
to the Prohibition Grille,

01:42.216 --> 01:45.218
a Southern restaurant
opened in 2008

01:45.319 --> 01:49.122
by professional belly dancer
Rishi Brown.

01:49.256 --> 01:51.457
How are my lips?

01:51.558 --> 01:52.758
[Chuckles] They're fine.

01:52.859 --> 01:55.260
I had no restaurant experience
at all.

01:55.361 --> 01:59.197
But I felt like if I could run
a successful dance company

01:59.299 --> 02:00.599
all of these years,

02:00.634 --> 02:03.836
surely I could operate
a restaurant business.

02:03.937 --> 02:05.937
Can I get anything
for you, Molly?

02:05.971 --> 02:07.338
- No.
- You good?

02:07.440 --> 02:08.573
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.442
Because I have no experience,

02:10.543 --> 02:12.477
I don't run my kitchen at all.

02:12.578 --> 02:14.779
Two tops.
Medium, medium, and rare.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.483
(Rishi) I hired someone who's had
30 years of restaurant experience.

02:18.584 --> 02:19.751
Good job, Rock.

02:19.819 --> 02:22.319
Not my first trip to the rodeo.
[Laughs]

02:22.420 --> 02:24.020
He's amazing at his job.

02:27.058 --> 02:29.793
- He's a little bit lazy.
- Be right back, gentlemen.

02:29.861 --> 02:32.663
He likes to smoke.

02:32.764 --> 02:34.998
- He likes to talk on his phone.
- Hello?

02:35.099 --> 02:36.399
You know, if I have an order,

02:36.501 --> 02:38.901
I have to text him
that there's an order.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.839
<i>(Colleen)</i>
<i>How's it tasting over here?</i>

02:42.940 --> 02:44.841
- It's really bland.
- It's really bland.

02:44.942 --> 02:46.342
We have customers
who complain all the time.

02:46.443 --> 02:49.178
- It's mushy.
- Is it? Okay.

02:49.245 --> 02:50.580
I've had dishes where
I've smelled it,

02:50.681 --> 02:52.281
and I was just like,
"you've gotta be kidding me."

02:52.382 --> 02:53.782
<i>(Candice) Rocky, the
ribs were disgusting.</i>

02:53.883 --> 02:56.585
If we could fix it, we would.

02:56.686 --> 02:58.419
But Rocky keeps Rishi
in the dark a little bit.

02:58.521 --> 03:00.021
What-- what was the problem
with the trout?

03:00.122 --> 03:01.723
- There was no problem with the trout.
- All right.

03:01.824 --> 03:03.825
Oh, my God.
Rishi is a little bit naive.

03:03.926 --> 03:05.961
She just sort of trusts Rocky.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.263
He has all the skills
and all the knowledge.

03:09.365 --> 03:11.398
Yum.

03:11.466 --> 03:13.501
I don't know anything about
what goes on back there.

03:13.602 --> 03:14.902
For Rishi to step in
from belly dancing

03:15.003 --> 03:16.504
into running a restaurant,

03:16.605 --> 03:19.339
I don't want to use the word
"clueless," but she was.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.442
Because she had no idea.
[Laughs]

03:22.544 --> 03:24.444
There's just some things
she does that I don't think

03:24.646 --> 03:28.180
a restaurant owner should do.

03:28.281 --> 03:30.583
For instance, belly dancing.

03:30.684 --> 03:33.586
(Candice) It doesn't go with
the theme of our restaurant.

03:33.687 --> 03:35.221
It makes no sense.

03:35.322 --> 03:40.226
Customers think it's weird.

03:40.327 --> 03:42.761
(Colleen) You know, I've been
in the business 20 years.

03:42.862 --> 03:44.462
I know how a business
is supposed to be run,

03:44.564 --> 03:47.666
and this is not the way.

03:51.203 --> 03:52.504
We gotta get
more people in here.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.305
[Sighs] Unbelievable.

03:54.407 --> 03:57.108
If Prohibition Grille fails,
I lose everything.

03:57.243 --> 04:00.945
I'm really discouraged.
I really need help.

04:01.046 --> 04:03.247
Because I'm at a complete loss
to understand what's happened.

04:03.348 --> 04:05.983
And I'm not stupid,

04:06.084 --> 04:07.885
but I really don't know
what's going on.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:17.226 --> 04:19.029
Wow.

04:19.129 --> 04:20.764
Here he comes.

04:25.369 --> 04:27.804
Wow, look at that.

04:27.905 --> 04:29.605
It's like something
you get given in Vegas.

04:29.706 --> 04:30.906
You could learn to belly dance.

04:31.007 --> 04:34.009
What the hell does that
got to do with the restaurant?

04:34.110 --> 04:35.544
Hi. Welcome.
I'm Rishi.

04:35.645 --> 04:36.879
- Rishi, nice to see you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

04:36.947 --> 04:41.050
- Wait a second.
- Yeah, that one's me. [Laughs]

04:41.150 --> 04:43.786
You're kidding me.
Uh, am I coming for lunch,

04:43.820 --> 04:46.788
or are we having a belly dance?

04:46.889 --> 04:49.090
- Do the owners know this goes on?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

04:49.191 --> 04:51.158
- I am the owner.
- Oh, you are the owner?

04:51.326 --> 04:53.628
- Yes.
- How long have you been doing this?

04:53.662 --> 04:55.730
- 30 years.
- And then you bought a restaurant.

04:55.831 --> 04:58.165
- Yes.
- And you still belly dance?

04:58.266 --> 05:00.367
- Yes. It's really fun. Yeah.
- Wow. Wow.

05:00.469 --> 05:02.769
- It's about undulating and shimmying.
- Right.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.907
Rolling the body
in motion with vibration.

05:10.111 --> 05:12.679
That-- oh.
That's undulating?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.380
- That's undulating. That's right.
- Rolling your tummy.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.256
- Yes.
- Wow, okay.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.251
Ooooh. Jeez.
[Laughs]

05:19.385 --> 05:22.221
So how'd you go
from belly dancing

05:22.288 --> 05:23.422
to becoming a restauranteur?

05:23.523 --> 05:27.660
Well, I decided,
over a cocktail one afternoon.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.663
Right. Okay.
[Laughs]

05:30.764 --> 05:32.364
Were you inebriated
at the time?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.799
Did it sort of make your mind

05:34.900 --> 05:36.101
- a little light-headed?
- Yeah.

05:36.201 --> 05:37.401
I remember it well.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.203
And then, once it happened,

05:39.238 --> 05:41.405
the idea came in, there it was.
It stayed.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.042
Had you ever worked
in a restaurant before, or...?

05:44.143 --> 05:46.044
I worked as a server
for about six months one time

05:46.145 --> 05:48.747
- when I was in college.
- Wow. Right.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.214
- Yeah. [Laughs]
<i>- Um...</i>

05:51.282 --> 05:52.783
And the style of food?
What is that?

05:52.884 --> 05:56.086
- We do a gourmet Southern menu here.
- Gourmet. Wow.

05:56.187 --> 05:58.889
Fine dining. We kinda have a
steak house theme here going on.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.125
- Dinner house theme.
- Dinner house, steak house.

06:01.225 --> 06:02.325
- Yeah.
- Fine dining.

06:02.426 --> 06:04.762
Yes, with a little
Southern flair to it.

06:04.863 --> 06:08.564
Wow. Um, okay.

06:08.598 --> 06:09.966
In your mind,
what's the biggest problem?

06:10.067 --> 06:11.400
In my mind, um...

06:11.501 --> 06:13.602
Well, we don't have
a grill here, so--

06:13.704 --> 06:16.605
- Say that again.
- We don't have a grill here.

06:16.707 --> 06:17.707
It's called Prohibition Grille.

06:17.808 --> 06:19.042
Hence, Prohibition Grille.
Right.

06:19.143 --> 06:22.144
(Gordon) Wow, a Prohibition
Grille with no grill.

06:22.244 --> 06:24.445
[Laughs]
<i>Wow. Okay.</i>

06:24.547 --> 06:26.548
- Let me take a seat.
- Sure.

06:26.683 --> 06:28.416
I have a special seat
right back here for you.

06:28.584 --> 06:29.885
Okay, great.

06:29.919 --> 06:33.689
- Nice boots, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.

06:33.823 --> 06:36.524
I really believe
in what we've done here.

06:36.559 --> 06:41.062
And I'm sure that Chef Ramsay
is gonna love the food today.

06:41.163 --> 06:44.165
Um, have you just been
to a party or...

06:44.265 --> 06:47.367
No, I just got all dressed up
just for you today.

06:47.468 --> 06:49.503
Oh, so you don't
dress like that normally?

06:49.604 --> 06:51.005
No, I do dress
like this normally.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.406
Oh, you do dress
like that normally. Wow.

06:52.507 --> 06:55.842
Uh, so I'm not special.
Anyway, never mind. Um...

06:55.943 --> 06:56.943
Actually, you are, yeah.

06:57.044 --> 06:59.345
Because this is
a special occasion for sure,

06:59.446 --> 07:01.681
I got a little more dolled up.

07:01.749 --> 07:05.885
- But this is my normal get-up.
- Wow. Okay. Great.

07:05.986 --> 07:06.986
This is a big menu, huh?

07:07.088 --> 07:08.788
Yeah.

07:08.889 --> 07:10.723
Wow. "Prohibition Grille,
Southern cuisine."

07:10.824 --> 07:13.158
- Yes.
- "Chef Rocky strives

07:13.226 --> 07:14.727
<i>for originality and diversity.</i>

07:14.828 --> 07:16.528
<i>Focusing on the quality</i>
<i>of freshness."</i>

07:16.629 --> 07:18.864
Without a grill,
that's quite a statement.

07:18.965 --> 07:20.165
Oh, it's so true.

07:20.266 --> 07:21.767
Wow.

07:21.868 --> 07:24.169
Okay, how do you rate the food?

07:24.270 --> 07:25.903
What do you give your food
out of ten?

07:26.004 --> 07:28.206
I give our food a ten.

07:28.306 --> 07:30.908
- A ten?
- Yeah. I think it's amazing.

07:31.009 --> 07:33.544
- I love everything on the menu.
- Okay, great.

07:33.645 --> 07:34.645
Nice to meet you.

07:34.747 --> 07:35.747
Nice to meet you too,
Chef Ramsay.

07:35.848 --> 07:37.348
Thanks for coming.

07:37.449 --> 07:38.950
And enjoy your lunch
today, okay?

07:39.051 --> 07:40.785
Thank you.

07:42.486 --> 07:45.288
What a bizarre dress sense
from the owner.

07:45.389 --> 07:47.390
<i>I mean, she looks like</i>
<i>she's in a fancy dress,</i>

07:47.491 --> 07:51.927
Britney Spears concert party.

07:52.028 --> 07:53.328
- Hello, I am Candice.
- Hello. How are you, my darling?

07:53.429 --> 07:54.730
- How are you?
- Yeah, very well.

07:54.831 --> 07:57.566
- Very nice to meet you.
- It's good to see you too.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.568
So did Rishi get a chance to go
over the menu at all with you?

07:59.669 --> 08:00.770
Uh, she did briefly.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.671
- Let's order, shall we?
- Okay.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.806
What's the soup of the day?

08:03.907 --> 08:05.207
The soup of the day
is jalapeno corn chowder.

08:05.308 --> 08:07.909
- What was it yesterday?
- Jalapeno corn chowder.

08:08.010 --> 08:10.111
- Oh, so soup every two days.
- And last week.

08:10.212 --> 08:12.947
- Ah. So soup of the week.
- It's soup of the week.

08:13.048 --> 08:14.749
- Let's have a soup of the week.
- Yes.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.252
Okay, um, let's go
for the filet.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.687
- How would you like that prepared?
- Medium rare, please.

08:19.789 --> 08:22.190
- Medium rare.
- Let's go for the collard greens as well

08:22.291 --> 08:24.792
besides the balsamic
brown sugar glazed salmon.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.226
And do you know what?

08:26.327 --> 08:28.728
- Throw me in a portion of the
pan-fried oysters. - Okay.

08:28.830 --> 08:29.830
We'll get that started for you.

08:29.931 --> 08:31.431
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:35.068 --> 08:38.571
Okay, so here's my list.

08:38.673 --> 08:41.207
So we're gonna do,
like, oysters,

08:41.308 --> 08:42.508
so why don't I start with

08:42.609 --> 08:44.610
- a cup of soup?
- Okey dokey.

08:44.711 --> 08:46.846
Yeah? Okay.

08:46.914 --> 08:48.948
I was just seeing
what you ordered.

08:49.049 --> 08:50.649
I thought those were
really great choices.
