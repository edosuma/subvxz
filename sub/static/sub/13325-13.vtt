00:01.434 --> 00:04.169
Patrick,
just to recap,
you like this guy,

00:04.171 --> 00:06.138
But his shoes were
the deal breaker?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.473
They were birkenstocks.

00:07.475 --> 00:10.776
I think the company's motto
is "never in style."

00:10.778 --> 00:13.512
Man sandals are a petty
and shallow reason

00:13.514 --> 00:15.481
To break up
with somebody, but...

00:15.483 --> 00:17.316
Totally understandable.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.218
You shoulda just
gone online to find out

00:19.220 --> 00:20.486
What kind of shoes
the guy buys

00:20.488 --> 00:22.087
Before you went out
with him.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.590
I don't think that information
exists online, nolan.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.058
Oh, I think it does,

00:26.060 --> 00:30.429
Mr. Emergency room visit,
spring break, 1986.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.765
Smashed a bottle
of beer on your head.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.768
It was spring training,
1988,

00:35.770 --> 00:38.103
And I could've sworn
I was still wearing
my batting helmet.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.306
What are you doing
poking around in my life?

00:41.308 --> 00:43.742
I was downloading lacey's
high school transcripts

00:43.744 --> 00:45.744
And I had some
spare time.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.448
By the way,
she got a d in sex ed.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.785
Wow, even with
all that extra credit.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.822
- I know, I know, I'm late.
- You're late, huh?

00:56.824 --> 00:59.691
Couldn't mean
an egg has taken root
in your uterus.

00:59.693 --> 01:03.829
Of course, you'd have
known that if you hadn't
slept through class.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.131
Not today, old man.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.733
- You okay, lace?
- No.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.735
My car was sticking out,
like, an inch

01:09.737 --> 01:11.470
Into your jerkwad
neighbor's driveway,

01:11.472 --> 01:12.805
And the old dude said
if I didn't move it,

01:12.807 --> 01:14.540
He would have me towed.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.508
Did you move your car?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.377
Yeah, into
his trash can,

01:18.379 --> 01:20.112
Then over his trash can,
then over his other trash can.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.247
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.583
So you got angry,
had an angry outburst,

01:24.585 --> 01:26.185
And now you don't want
to talk about your anger

01:26.187 --> 01:29.088
In anger therapy?

01:29.090 --> 01:31.256
Cool, so you get it?

01:32.659 --> 01:33.826
( sighs )
come on, lacey.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.327
We're going back there
to apologize.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.129
Why?
He started it.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.164
That sounds like
school yard logic to me.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.666
- Does not.
- Does, too.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.267
Okay, we're going.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.836
You had a setback,
you need to make amends.
Come on.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.105
No, I already made
amends with my god,

01:46.107 --> 01:47.506
And he's forgiven me.

01:47.508 --> 01:51.143
You're a hindu.
Which god are you
talking about?

01:51.145 --> 01:52.678
I don't know, there's
like 5,000 of them.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.279
I'm sure one of them's
cool with it.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.517
<i>( tool ratcheting )</i>

01:59.452 --> 02:01.753
- Mr. Hoffler?
- Yes, sir?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.555
Charlie goodson,
I live two houses down.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.657
Oh, I remember you.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.860
You're the guy that likes
to throw crap into the wind

02:07.862 --> 02:09.628
Just to see
where it will land.

02:11.598 --> 02:14.233
Okay, first of all, that
wasn't my candy wrapper
on your lawn,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.768
As we discussed for
a solid hour last week.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.140
I don't know if this is
your girlfriend or not,

02:21.142 --> 02:24.476
But she's the one that
drove over my trash cans,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.345
Which, by the way,
would be a great place

02:26.347 --> 02:27.880
To put your candy wrappers.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.882
Look, I'm a therapist,

02:29.884 --> 02:31.517
And lacey is part of
an anger management group

02:31.519 --> 02:32.918
That meets at my house
once a week.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.553
Anger management?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.821
Isn't that where
the courts send those

02:35.823 --> 02:37.756
Asswipe celebrities
and overpaid jocks

02:37.758 --> 02:40.159
So they can learn
to control their temper?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.828
I wish.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.630
Wait a second here.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.466
You're telling me
that you're bringing
violent lunatics

02:47.468 --> 02:49.368
Into our neighborhood
every day

02:49.370 --> 02:51.570
And you're having meetings
at your house?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.772
- They're not
violent lunatics.
- Oh, yeah?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.942
What did you do to get
into this group, sweetie pie?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.911
The court sent me there.
I'm on probation.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.445
That's none of
his business, lacey.

03:00.447 --> 03:03.782
His imagination
is probably worse
than anything I did.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.318
I shot my boyfriend
in the balls.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.721
Oh, my holy mary,
mother of god.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.823
Sounds bad
out of context.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.394
What context?
Did his balls pull
a knife on her?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.197
No, they complained that
I parked in their driveway.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.865
Are you threatening me?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.201
Obviously not.
You don't have
any balls.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.836
Okay, all right, well,
that's our apology,
so we're gonna go.

03:24.838 --> 03:28.640
Good, at least this time
you're taking your trash
with you.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.376
You douche nozzle!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.711
Douche nozzle?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.379
It-- it's not
what you think.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.381
It's "du schnuzzel."

03:36.383 --> 03:40.752
It's german for
"our noses, may they always
meet in peace."

03:40.754 --> 03:42.354
Du schnuzzel!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.658
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:47.961 --> 03:50.262
Okay...

03:50.264 --> 03:52.931
Here's what
I picked up.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.633
Ooh...

03:54.635 --> 03:57.002
His and hers
sensual lubricant.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.672
This one gives
you an invigorating
warming sensation

04:00.674 --> 04:03.242
And this one gives me
a thrilling tingling
sensation,

04:03.244 --> 04:05.677
And when we
combine them, voila,

04:05.679 --> 04:07.646
Our genitals become
the wonder twins.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.882
- What'd you get?
- Was I supposed to
get something?

04:10.884 --> 04:13.285
Duh, that was the plan.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.886
I'm just joking with ya,
of course I got you something.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.321
I got you a, um...

04:19.792 --> 04:22.894
Sex whisk.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.830
( laughs )

04:24.832 --> 04:26.632
No, I'm just
playing with ya.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.401
What I got you is...

04:29.403 --> 04:31.970
Sticky sex notes.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.741
So I can remember
all the things

04:35.743 --> 04:37.709
I want to do to you.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.953
"patent the sex whisk."

04:49.889 --> 04:51.957
It wasn't
a pretty dress.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.493
It looked like something
you'd bury snow white in.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.927
The only reason
you didn't like it

04:55.929 --> 04:57.829
Is because
I picked it out.

04:57.831 --> 05:02.668
I spent two weeks
trying to help
this little...

05:02.670 --> 05:06.305
Daughter of ours buy
a dress for junior prom.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.006
Carter mcgarry
asked me to go

05:08.008 --> 05:09.841
And he's really cute.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.944
Do you see anything wrong
with a dress like this?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.313
No, no, it's great
if you want to wear

05:14.315 --> 05:17.316
A pile of napkins
covered in glitter barf.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.684
That's what I said.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.751
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.455
Well, what about
this one with the
sweetheart neckline?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.424
Of course, you'd have to lose
a couple of the bows

05:25.426 --> 05:28.493
And the pouty-looking
gay dude in the background...

05:28.495 --> 05:30.862
I'd love
something like that.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.964
Can you come shopping
with us right now?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.533
Why are we dragging
kate into this?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.802
She hasn't done
anything to us.

05:36.804 --> 05:40.405
If sam wants an extra
set of eyes, I'd be
happy to help.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.107
Are you sure?
I gotta warn you.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.775
This isn't just shopping
with a teenage girl,

05:43.777 --> 05:45.877
This is shopping
with the devil.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.979
Yeah, charlie,
I know what it's like.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.881
I used to be
a teenage girl.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.750
Are you sure?
I can't picture that.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.785
I thought you came out
of the robot factory
just like that.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.955
So you'll come?

05:56.957 --> 05:59.124
Yeah, I know prom's
a special time.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.493
I don't want to intrude
on any cherished

06:01.495 --> 06:02.894
Mother-daughter moment.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.765
Doesn't matter.
I'm dead inside.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.899
You're driving.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.542
I know you're a curious
little monkey boy,

06:17.544 --> 06:18.877
But don't get any of
that stuff near
your eyes.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.445
It burns like
pepper spray.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.447
And I'm supposed to put this
on my genitals?

06:22.449 --> 06:23.515
Yes.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.787
<i>( door closes )</i>

06:43.803 --> 06:44.936
Hey.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.141
Don't you knock?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.615
Have you-- nice lube.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.553
Hoffler's saying
the people in your group

07:01.555 --> 07:02.988
Are a threat
to the neighborhood.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.956
Doesn't want them meeting
in your house.

07:04.958 --> 07:09.761
You know, you could
always spray this stuff
in his eyes.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.931
Trust me,
it's like pepper spray.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.538
Has become a de facto
mental institution

07:19.540 --> 07:21.139
For antisocial,
unstable,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.041
And potentially
dangerous individuals."

07:23.043 --> 07:25.744
What a douche nozzle.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.878
Douche nozzle.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.847
Is that worse
than a douche bag?

07:28.849 --> 07:31.583
I don't know,
it's not important.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.751
You know what?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.486
Maybe the nozzle
is worse than the bag.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.755
Would you stop?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.089
You live right between
me and hoffler.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.458
I need you to go
over there and tell him

07:39.460 --> 07:41.059
That my patients
don't cause any trouble.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.761
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.529
If I didn't have plans
to build a jacuzzi

07:44.531 --> 07:46.064
That crosses
onto his property.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.767
Are you serious?
This is about a jacuzzi?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.769
Come on. Who was there
for you when you got stuck

07:50.771 --> 07:52.237
In your doggy door?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.972
Okay, I get it.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.607
But I need a jacuzzi.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.676
I don't get a lot
of girls, charlie.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.945
My only game
is close-up magic.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.880
Close-up magic
does not work.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.850
Yep, you do need
a jacuzzi.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.821
Here, try
this one on.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.690
( gasps )
oh, that looks good.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.527
Of course she likes it.
You picked it.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.929
Maybe she likes it
'cause it's a nice dress.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.899
Oh, please. I know
what a nice dress
looks like.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.001
I went to five proms
in a row.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.037
That's right, graduation
didn't stop me.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.540
I think you're placing
a little too much value

08:28.542 --> 08:30.242
On this prom thing.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.911
It's just a misogynistic
parade of conformity

08:32.913 --> 08:34.880
That rewards blondeness.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.183
Damn straight.
Best five nights
of my life.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.887
Let me guess,
you were one of
those dark goth girls

08:41.889 --> 08:43.655
Who was too cool
to go to prom?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.223
No, I was going to,

08:45.225 --> 08:46.658
But I was smoking pot

08:46.660 --> 08:48.960
With morrissey
at the roxie.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.629
Lost track of time.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.133
- Let's go.
- What about the dress?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.535
Ruby texted me.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.003
She saw carter
at cold stone

08:58.005 --> 08:59.638
Making out
with eva pizzoli.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.973
Oh, honey,
I'm so sorry.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.543
I know it's lame,
but I really wanted to go.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.044
It's not lame.
You should go...

09:06.046 --> 09:07.646
In a revenge dress.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.180
( gasps )
oh, my gosh.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.183
- Yes, a revenge dress.
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.286
And then when you walk
into the gym,

09:14.288 --> 09:16.154
It's like
record scratch.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.156
- Slow mo.
- Everyone turns.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.724
Carter's head explodes.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.794
And then you
go to the roxie.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.563
No, you don't.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.899
I don't want you guys
to be alarmed,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.068
But these are the flyers
that my neighbor's
been circulating.

09:30.070 --> 09:34.940
There's unstable
and potentially dangerous
people in the neighborhood?

09:34.942 --> 09:37.075
We should
get out of here.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.812
Those people are us,
you unstable dumbass.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.247
Wait a minute.
Hoffler?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.849
That stick-in-the-mud
down the street?

09:44.851 --> 09:46.918
Every day
when I pass his house,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.621
I throw my candy wrappers
on his lawn.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.256
( laughs )

09:51.258 --> 09:53.758
Drives him crazy.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.694
Yeah, I heard.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.597
The way I see it,
we have two options.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.898
I can either relocate
to an office...

09:59.900 --> 10:03.368
- I'm not paying for parking.
- That's not the point, patrick.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.203
Will there be a starbucks?
'cause I hate your coffee.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.372
...Or we could
stand together,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.374
Let these people know
that we are no different
than they are

10:09.376 --> 10:11.676
And we have every right
to meet in this neighborhood.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.311
- We?
- Hey, I have
anger issues.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.313
I've lived with the stigma.
I'm just like you.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.150
Except I am allowed
to fly on southwest,

10:19.152 --> 10:21.319
Jet blue,
and air israel.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.923
- So what do
you guys think?
- Let's give him hell.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.157
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Charlie: <i>Good, good.</i>

10:26.159 --> 10:27.392
Patrick:
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

10:27.394 --> 10:29.828
Why are you banned
from air israel?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.630
It was an honest mistake.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.833
I'd just assumed
they were called jewardesses.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.270
Here we go.
Thanks for coming.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.372
Enjoy the brunch.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.873
In a few minutes,
I'll do a q&a

10:41.875 --> 10:44.075
To put everybody's mind
at ease about my group.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.679
Sorry I'm late.
What's the plan?

10:47.681 --> 10:50.081
Just get in there
and mingle.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.683
Be very sweet.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.284
Then when I
reveal that you guys
are my patients,

10:53.286 --> 10:56.688
Got it. Okay, does
this outfit make me look

10:56.690 --> 10:59.057
Antisocial, unstable,
or potentially dangerous?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.159
No, I think it
hides it very well.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.334
Hi, I'm lacey.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.102
I'm new
to the neighborhood.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.839
Hi, I'm chad and this
is my wife shelly.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.108
- Hi.
- How do you do?

11:19.745 --> 11:21.046
Did you just curtsy?

11:21.048 --> 11:23.748
A little.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.386
Well, mary anne
and delondroy,

11:28.388 --> 11:31.690
You're preaching
to the choir on that one.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.092
I mean, I believe
we should spend more

11:34.094 --> 11:37.395
Of our taxpayers' money
to support the arts.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.198
Now, if that little
rainbow baby of yours

11:40.200 --> 11:41.966
Grows up and wants
to be a rapper

11:41.968 --> 11:44.169
Or a full-time
sidewalk artist,

11:44.171 --> 11:46.905
I would be thrilled
to work harder

11:46.907 --> 11:50.709
And take home
much, much less.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.212
No, no, no, no.
That does not look

11:54.214 --> 11:55.447
Too tight on you
at all.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.382
I mean, if you got it,
flaunt it,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.117
And you, sweetheart,
have a--

11:59.119 --> 12:00.351
You have a lot of it.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.193
I'm not worried about
the anger management groups.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.994
What concerns me
is the proliferation

12:09.996 --> 12:12.063
Of the medical
marijuana dispensaries.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.866
Talk about
a suspicious-looking
group of people.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.301
And the lines.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.071
Hey, everybody.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.873
I want to thank you all
for coming.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.509
I'm charlie goodson
and I've got a little
surprise for you.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.245
Some of the people
you've been mingling with

12:27.247 --> 12:28.880
Are not your neighbors.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.850
<i>They're actually members</i>
<i>of my anger management group.</i>

12:31.852 --> 12:34.753
Now, contrary to the lies
circulated by mr. Hoffler,

12:34.755 --> 12:37.088
Only one of them has any
history of a violent crime.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.992
Fooled you.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.061
Guys, come on up here.
Come on.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.500
Now, these are good
and decent people.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.401
You've enjoyed their company
all morning,

12:50.403 --> 12:52.036
So please think about that
when you're asked

12:52.038 --> 12:53.438
To sign the petition.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.374
Hello, chucky.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.376
I knew I'd
find you here.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.045
In my house?
You're a genius.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.183
- What do you want?
- Justice.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.152
One of your sickos
spray-painted

13:07.154 --> 13:09.420
"douche nozzle"
on my garage door.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.190
( crowd murmuring )

13:12.192 --> 13:14.392
And I'm pretty sure
I know who did it.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.429
Are you blaming me,
douche nozzle?

13:19.932 --> 13:21.366
I rest my case.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.871
Everybody,
enjoy yourselves.

13:26.873 --> 13:30.141
There's plenty
of champagne and tuna.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.413
Okay, I just have
one thing to say.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.549
I did not write
"douche nozzle"

13:37.551 --> 13:39.083
On that douche
nozzle's house,

13:39.085 --> 13:41.486
Even though all you
douche nozzles think I did.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.588
Nobody's making
any judgments here.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.123
I am.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.158
Because of her,
I wasted an hour

13:47.160 --> 13:51.863
Spewing hippie garbage
at ore and o.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.131
This is crazy.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.200
I swear to god
I didn't do it.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.968
Why don't you guys
believe me?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.303
I believe you, lacey.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.006
Why don't you guys
believe me?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.176
Look, everybody,
I'll figure this out.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.311
It's all gonna be fine.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.580
I'll see everybody
Tuesday...

14:08.582 --> 14:10.548
Somewhere.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.851
Lacey, can I see you
for a second?

14:15.621 --> 14:17.021
If you're trying
to make me feel better

14:17.023 --> 14:18.156
About those guys
turning on me,

14:18.158 --> 14:19.858
It's sweet,
but forget it.

14:19.860 --> 14:24.996
Lacey, kahlua isn't
gonna help with your
frustration.

14:24.998 --> 14:25.997
Oh, my god,
you're right.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.365
I should have tequila.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.436
Lacey, you know
I'm on your side, right?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.004
At least somebody is.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.606
Ooh, rum. That's like
pirate tequila.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.277
And we're all working
to keep the group
in this house

14:39.279 --> 14:41.012
And maintain
our dignity.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.147
It's below the label,
so I'm just gonna chug it.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.415
Lacey, come on,
come on.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.351
<i>( bottle clunks )</i>

14:46.353 --> 14:48.152
You got here late.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.888
You called hoffler
a douche nozzle.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.023
Wait, you
don't believe me?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.558
- Lacey--
- you don't, do you?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.326
Oh, my god.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.595
As your therapist,
I cannot help you with
your anger issues

14:57.597 --> 14:59.230
Unless you're
honest with me.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.966
You know what? I may have
to go to your group

15:01.968 --> 15:04.202
'cause the court says so,
but that's all I'm gonna do.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.537
I'm gonna sit there
and stare blankly.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.573
Oh, come on.
I don't really believe
you'd do that.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.576
See? You don't believe
anything I say.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.378
I just want you
to be honest with yourself.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.579
- You want me
to be honest?
- Yes.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.014
You suck.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.651
Okay, that I believe.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.419
<i>( door slams )</i>

15:22.688 --> 15:24.622
Well, it's been
three hours.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.058
You think sam's
revenge dress worked?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.660
Are you kidding me?
She looked so hot,

15:28.662 --> 15:31.095
We might've screwed up
this boy's life for good.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.465
Both:
Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.935
You know, it really
meant a lot to me

15:36.937 --> 15:40.104
That you helped slut up
my daughter for the prom.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.340
I have to be honest.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.075
Shopping for dresses
with you guys

15:44.077 --> 15:46.210
Kinda made me feel
like I missed out

15:46.212 --> 15:47.946
On going to my prom.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.215
Well, since we're
being honest,

15:51.217 --> 15:54.185
You didn't miss much.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.055
Just lots of slow dancing
to journey,

15:57.057 --> 15:59.457
Some sweaty boy
trying to press his junk

15:59.459 --> 16:01.526
Up against your leg.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.727
That sounds horrible.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.330
So we agree
prom night blows.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.397
It's the worst.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.668
( gasps )

16:10.670 --> 16:12.236
Oh, my god.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.706
That was the best night
of my entire life.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.375
Carter was staring at me
the whole time.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.143
Thank you guys so much.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.446
Oh, that's
so wonderful, honey.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.348
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.354
I think she's miserable.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.191
Yeah, she just doesn't
know it yet.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.459
Drinks at the roxie?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.160
Yes, I'll call a cab.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.063
Full disclosure--
it wasn't morrissey,

16:39.065 --> 16:41.265
It was the other dude
from wham.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.436
Hey, charlie.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.241
I, uh, heard
about what happened
at the brunch.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.743
Yeah, it was bad.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.144
I've been calling my
neighbors all night,

16:53.146 --> 16:54.345
Trying to get them
to change their minds.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.781
What was lacey thinking?

16:56.783 --> 16:59.117
Maybe
she wasn't thinking.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.352
Maybe she was
a little drunk

17:01.354 --> 17:03.121
And finally had enough

17:03.123 --> 17:05.156
Of that fascist
son of a bitch hoffler

17:05.158 --> 17:06.190
When he told her
that she can't

17:06.192 --> 17:08.526
Have her
oversized hot tub.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.162
You wrote
"douche nozzle"?

17:11.164 --> 17:12.530
Lacey's being
blamed for it.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.765
I-- I know, I know.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.201
Look, I'll just
go tell hoffler
that I did it.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.170
No, it won't help.
He knows you're my friend

17:19.172 --> 17:20.471
And he'll think you're
covering for the group.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.240
I can't believe
you did this.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.108
I'm sorry.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.210
I just snapped.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.379
I can't go back
to the magic, charlie.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.681
You ruined a relationship
with one of my patients.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.051
And you know what?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.752
Your magic sucks.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.287
It's always
the ace of spades,

17:36.289 --> 17:37.455
I can see the coin
in your hand,

17:37.457 --> 17:38.790
And you use
a fake thumb.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.124
Oh, my god.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.392
How do you know that?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.095
Because you're black
and the thumb isn't.

17:44.097 --> 17:47.598
You cannot take
a white thumb and color it
with a magic marker.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.133
And by the way,
that marker?

17:49.135 --> 17:50.701
It's the closest
you'll ever get to magic.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.213
What do you want?

18:02.215 --> 18:03.247
I'm getting ready
to go out.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.183
I found out
you didn't do it.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.417
Oh, you know
who'd be interested?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.518
- The door.
- No, no, no.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.087
Lace, lace,
lace, lace.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.289
I'm sorry.
I should've never
assumed you were guilty.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.458
I want you to know
that not once

18:13.460 --> 18:15.760
Since I've been
in your group have I
ever lied to you.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.096
I tell you embarrassing
things about myself,

18:18.098 --> 18:21.165
Like I didn't wear underwear
to my assault hearing,

18:21.167 --> 18:23.768
Hoping the judge
would drop the charges.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.504
I already knew that 'cause
the judge wrote in your file,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.473
"the defendant
shows no remorse,

18:28.475 --> 18:29.841
But did show
a lot of other stuff."

18:31.376 --> 18:32.643
I don't think we have
anything else to talk about.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.212
Yes, we do.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.380
I believe that you
never lied to me
in therapy.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.382
And even though
you got some issues,

18:38.384 --> 18:39.550
I think you've made
a lot of progress

18:39.552 --> 18:40.551
In the last 11 months.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.887
So, here.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.222
What is this?

18:44.224 --> 18:45.490
I spoke to your
probation officer

18:45.492 --> 18:47.658
And got you out of
anger therapy early.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.194
You're kidding me.
So, I'm done?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.530
Signed it this morning.
It's all legal.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.433
Wow.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.601
Guess this
is good-bye.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.870
I guess so.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.772
You know,
when I think about
that angry young woman

19:01.774 --> 19:03.508
That walked
through my door...

19:05.878 --> 19:08.646
Yep, that's the one.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.683
So when are we gonna move
to these offices

19:12.685 --> 19:16.287
That you swear to god
will be close to my house?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.555
Still looking, ed.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.923
Well, you can
stop looking.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.791
Once again my lack
of social skills

19:20.793 --> 19:23.528
And excessive amount of time
on the internet
has paid off.

19:23.530 --> 19:27.198
I dug up some really
sketchy dirt on hoffler.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.567
No, no, no, we're not
gonna use personal attacks

19:29.569 --> 19:31.636
To blackmail this guy
into letting us stay here.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.670
We're gonna take
the high road.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.505
You're probably right.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.806
Besides, who's gonna care
that he built

19:35.808 --> 19:38.209
A sex dungeon
in his basement?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.478
On the other hand,
the low road

19:40.480 --> 19:42.547
Is a lot less congested.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.949
All right, we've got
that taken care of.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.217
We can begin
the meeting.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.586
Where the hell's
gunga dim?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.855
Lacey will no longer
be joining us.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.723
( squeaks )

19:52.725 --> 19:56.561
So you kicked her out
of the group?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.829
Actually, it turns out
she didn't do it.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.766
We had a long talk
and I signed her release

20:01.768 --> 20:03.467
So she could finish therapy
a month early.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.770
If you're writing letters,
write one for me.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.606
Tell my wife I'm dead
so I can start a new life

20:08.608 --> 20:12.310
In corpus christi and
fulfill my lifetime dream.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.611
What dream is that?

20:13.613 --> 20:17.215
To leave my wife and move
to corpus christi.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.650
I can't believe this.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.519
So she's just out there
all alone

20:21.521 --> 20:22.887
Feeling like
we betrayed her?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.422
Well, I'm not just
gonna sit here.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.257
I don't care
if I have to search

20:26.259 --> 20:27.325
The ends of the earth.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.460
I'm gonna find--
I found her.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.863
Don't touch me, tool.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.334
Well, we may have
falsely accused her,

20:36.336 --> 20:37.702
But we didn't
break her spirit.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.439
I gotta say, lace,
I'm surprised to see you here.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.674
So am I, but I woke up
this morning

20:43.676 --> 20:46.577
And I realized that
when you called me a liar,

20:46.579 --> 20:47.745
I didn't lash out at you

20:47.747 --> 20:49.947
Or do anything violent
like I usually do,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.917
So I figured
I must be improving.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.685
And that's
why you came back?

20:54.687 --> 20:55.853
Yeah.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.888
That and last night,

20:57.890 --> 20:59.557
Someone else
called me a liar,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.592
And I knocked
that skank out

21:01.594 --> 21:04.362
With my absolutely
<i>real</i> chanel bag.

21:07.032 --> 21:10.001
Well, they say that relapse
is a part of recovery.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.637
So let's hope that skank
has a speedy recovery.
