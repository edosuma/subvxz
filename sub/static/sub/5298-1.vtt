<i>Hey, this is Tris.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:01.528 --> 01:06.192
Hey, Tris, it's Nick. How are you?
It's about 3 in the afternoon.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.663
I think you're probably
still at school.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.762
I stayed home today.
I took a personal day.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.065
I wanted to finish up
some creative projects...

01:15.275 --> 01:18.733
...and stuff that I've been working on
around here.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.342
Nothing to do with you or anything.

01:26.219 --> 01:30.781
So I'm sorry, real sorry I missed you.
I was hoping to get you on the phone.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.952
Haven't talked to you in a while...

01:34.894 --> 01:37.829
...and I just kind of wanted to
speak to you at some point.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.496
You know, I think last time
we spoke...

01:41.701 --> 01:45.467
...we both kind of said some really
nasty things that neither of us meant.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.697
You know, just, like...

01:48.208 --> 01:50.472
...when you broke up with me,
you know...

01:50.677 --> 01:52.668
...and everything, on my b-day.

02:02.655 --> 02:06.386
Also, that mixed CD
that I left on your doorstep...

02:06.593 --> 02:09.425
...was the last one
that I'll be making for you.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.322
More or less.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.129
Anyway, give me a call.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.566
I'm doing very well.
I hope you're great.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.171
Have a great weekend,
and do something fun, you know.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.308
Just get out there.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.637
Call me, though,
when you get a chance.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.676
All right. Bye.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.109
<i>Message has been deleted.</i>

02:29.749 --> 02:30.738
Fuck.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.919
<i>To re-record
your message, press one.</i>

03:14.994 --> 03:16.222
Norah.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.594
Norah.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.755
It's Friday, pumpkin.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.696
I'm sorry. Do you mind?
I'm in my zone.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.733
- Oh, you're in your zone. I'm so...
- What?

03:24.938 --> 03:25.927
- What?
- What?

03:26.139 --> 03:27.128
What? What? What?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.898
Could you please
come join my zone?

03:29.108 --> 03:30.132
Hey, guys.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.640
- Hi.
- Hey, Tris.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.106
He made another one.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.678
Look at the ridiculous cover art.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.406
L...

03:39.686 --> 03:41.313
Don't.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.611
- Don't do it.
- Don't do what?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.484
Let's go already.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.923
He makes the best mixes in the world.
Look at this cover art.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.827
Tris does not know
what she gave up.

03:52.665 --> 03:56.123
<i>"Road to Closure Volume 12"?
Poor bastard.</i>

03:56.336 --> 03:58.964
You are so in love with this guy
it is ridiculous.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.663
Okay, I have never met him.
I have no idea who he is.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.501
I'm just gonna put this in my iPod.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.657
Is that always there?

04:29.135 --> 04:30.693
Yes, always.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.063
Sorry.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.172
That's where we put the garbage.

04:39.712 --> 04:40.701
Yo.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.210
- Yo.
- I'm not going.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.145
- What do you mean you're not going?
- Let's load the van.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.581
I don't wanna go.
I'm taking a mental-health day.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.153
We have a gig, Nicky.
This is a big night for us.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.221
This is our first night
with our new name.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.360
We are the Jerk Offs,
and we finally found a drummer.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.586
You found a drummer? Who?

04:58.765 --> 05:01.325
That's a children's toy.
Who's gonna operate that thing?

05:01.534 --> 05:03.661
- You.
- Okay. Thanks for coming by, guys.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.159
Nicky.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.694
We love you, okay...

05:06.906 --> 05:09.670
...but you've been depressed
for a month and it's not cool.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.935
Get your clothes.
We're gonna play this gig...

05:12.145 --> 05:13.703
...then find you something better.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.904
- Someone better.
- Yes.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.414
Not that easy. You don't know
what it's like to be straight. It's awful.

05:19.619 --> 05:21.484
<i>- Jersey's only source for indie rock.</i>

05:21.688 --> 05:23.986
<i>And for all of you
Where's Fluffy fans out there...</i>

05:24.190 --> 05:27.717
<i>...for the first time since the last time,
looks like Fluffy's to be found...</i>

05:27.927 --> 05:30.395
<i>...somewhere in the five boroughs
tonight.</i>

05:30.596 --> 05:33.360
<i>The rarest show on Earth
is rumored to go on after hours...</i>

05:33.566 --> 05:35.625
<i>...so keep an eye out
for those white rabbits.</i>

05:35.835 --> 05:38.030
<i>You never know
where they might lead you.</i>

05:39.272 --> 05:41.137
Fluffy. You can't say no to Fluffy.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.206
- Okay, all right. I'll go.
- Yes.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.639
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Put some clothes on.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.246
- But I'm taking my own car.
- And put on some pants.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.074
- Oh, my God.
- What?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.274
Okay.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.920
I just got a text from Carrie
saying Where's Fluffy...

05:56.122 --> 05:59.250
...is doing a surprise show tonight.
- Oh, my God.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.792
Last time they had a surprise show
it was at Arlene's. Start there.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.257
Okay, wait.

06:04.464 --> 06:08.230
Promise me that you won't get drunk
and leave me alone the whole night.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.698
When have I ever done that?
I promise.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.063
Caroline.

06:12.271 --> 06:16.230
Did you hear? Who's Fluffy is playing
in the city tonight. I love that band.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.910
It's "Where's Fluffy. "

06:19.679 --> 06:21.943
Whatever. So I'm bringing this guy.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.378
He's been following me around
the mall for months.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.178
- Maybe it's your scent.
- Yeah, what's that called?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.979
"I Cheat on People"
by Calvin Klein?

06:29.489 --> 06:31.753
And what do you wear?
"My Daddy's Famous" by Dior?

06:31.958 --> 06:36.418
- All right, you're both pretty.
- I was only kidding. So sensitive.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.994
Okay, talk to you later.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.359
Bye.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.535
- Why do you humor her?
- She's not that bad.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.967
We grew up with her.
Just don't let it ruin your night.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.333
Fluffy.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.475
- Fluffy. Fluffy.
- Fluffy. Fluffy.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.540
Goddamn it. Come on.

07:36.789 --> 07:37.949
Cheers.

07:38.157 --> 07:41.558
- Hey, baby, you look good.
- No, you look good, baby.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.984
- Give it.
- It's mine.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.447
We are the Jerk Offs.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.882
Nick, the drum machine. Turn it off.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.856
I don't know how this works.
There's no off button.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.493
You suck!

09:56.996 --> 09:58.827
Drum machines suck.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.100
Your mother buy that for you?

10:04.770 --> 10:08.672
- Oh, my God, you dirty little slut.
- What? What did I...?

10:08.874 --> 10:10.933
You're practically blowing him
with your eyes.

10:11.143 --> 10:16.080
I am not. You cannot do anybody
with your eyes, Caroline.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.649
Well, you can. But whatever.
He's a complete mo, look at him.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.685
He is not a mo.
Look at how shitty he's dressed.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.822
- His Supercuts haircut. He's coming.
- I know.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.159
Sorry. I'm sorry.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.151
That was really good.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.389
Well, he's bridge-and-tunnel,
obviously.

10:33.599 --> 10:36.090
If he's bridge-and-tunnel,
then what does that make us?

10:36.335 --> 10:39.270
Doesn't make us anything.
You're very drunk. Come on, let's go.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.441
Whatever, you're drunk.
Why don't you cut the cord, Mom?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.037
Hi.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.876
- God.
- Hi, I've been looking at you guys.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.606
Have you been looking at me?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.511
Hey, Nicky.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.716
Ask this beefy guy
what his name is for me.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.527
- What's your name?
- Anything you want it to be.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.756
- He's creepy.
- He's harmless.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.492
And he's gonna help us find Fluffy.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.532
What's your problem?

11:13.039 --> 11:14.370
She's here.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.571
You told her
not to come to the shows.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.209
I did. She came anyway.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.208
Don't even think
about going over there.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.938
I need to say hi if she came
all this way to see me.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.874
Dude, don't give into temptation.
She's not worth it.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.512
Oh, my God. I love it.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.782
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.985
- Oh, my God, all right, how's it look?
- Fits great. It looks really good.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.180
Is it too long in the back?

12:07.593 --> 12:09.026
No.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.021
So you like it?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.623
Yeah.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.694
- Come here.
- Good.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.073
- Who do you belong to?
- Tris. Tris.

12:21.273 --> 12:25.107
No, no, louder. Who do you belong to?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.811
Norah.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.210
Alone again?

12:33.619 --> 12:36.349
Hey, Tris.
Been looking for you everywhere.

12:36.555 --> 12:40.855
This is the one I was telling you about.
You have friends who'd be into her?

12:41.060 --> 12:44.052
You know what, that's okay.
Thanks, anyway.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.128
Oh, well, you know,
Gary's in college.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.698
You could have better luck
with college guys.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.894
That's when guys really get into stuff
like how smart a girl is, you know?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.834
It's not all about looks.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.469
Yeah. Gary seems real deep.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.907
But I guess Ira Silverberg's daughter
doesn't have to worry about looks.

13:07.219 --> 13:10.211
- I came here with someone, actually.
- Really?

13:10.422 --> 13:12.913
- Yep.
- Who?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.524
My boyfriend.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.194
Your boyfriend?

13:16.395 --> 13:17.384
Yeah.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.655
Guess you should be getting
back to him, then.

13:19.865 --> 13:20.991
Yeah.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.533
Okay. I'm gonna go see him, then.

13:38.684 --> 13:39.776
Hi.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.444
I know this is gonna sound weird,
and I'm a stranger...

13:43.656 --> 13:46.056
...but would you be my boyfriend
for five minutes?

13:46.258 --> 13:47.247
What?

13:50.729 --> 13:51.991
Him?

13:53.432 --> 13:55.024
Okay, just be cool. Just be cool.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.262
Just, please, just go with it, okay?

14:16.088 --> 14:17.919
Nick. Norah.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.491
How do you guys, like,
know each other?

14:20.693 --> 14:21.990
What?

14:24.029 --> 14:29.831
We go to the same dentist together.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.570
Dr. Mann.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.907
<i>Manno Mannowitz.</i>

14:38.043 --> 14:39.601
Come on, Gary.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.279
Hey, did you get my mixes?

14:45.551 --> 14:46.609
How do you know Tris?

14:47.319 --> 14:50.482
Mixes? Are you Tris' Nick?

14:50.689 --> 14:53.590
She told you about me?
How do you know her?

14:53.792 --> 14:55.282
Oh, dear God.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.226
Go.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.767
That tastes so good.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.769
Help, help, help. I just made out
with Tris' sloppy seconds.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.635
What's the problem now?

15:10.843 --> 15:14.540
Caroline, the problem is that this is not
gonna compete with perfect little that.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.874
Okay? It's time to go. Night is over.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.777
- I fell.
- I know you fell.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.508
Let me give you a hand with that.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.244
- I gotta get her home.
- Are you going back to Englewood?

15:23.455 --> 15:26.913
- I can take you. That where you live?
- Do I look like I'm from Englewood?

15:27.126 --> 15:30.357
I don't know if you're saying
that you are from there or you're not.

15:30.562 --> 15:33.497
That's one super cut
you got there, dude.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.257
- Think she's drunk.
- Oh, yeah.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.493
I'm just parked right out front.
I think we can walk her out there.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.332
- Wait. Stop.
- What?

15:41.540 --> 15:44.065
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Caroline.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.767
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.469
Hi.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.237
Hi.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.246
Hi, we're Bishop Allen.

16:00.426 --> 16:05.523
- Try to walk. Focus on walking.
- Hi, guys. So look, I need you.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.822
What?

16:08.233 --> 16:09.598
Can we get a ride?

16:10.202 --> 16:14.935
Who...? We? Is that...? Are you...?
You and this fellow here? Is that "we"?

16:15.407 --> 16:18.103
- Well...
- Sorry, Tris, the car's full.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.675
You didn't say "hi" to me earlier.
Are you mad at me?

16:23.615 --> 16:26.083
I think you should probably
take Drunkzilla here...

16:26.285 --> 16:28.219
...back to Daddy's house anyway,
don't you?

16:28.420 --> 16:30.581
And I was just talking to Nick, so...

16:31.490 --> 16:35.950
You know what, Tris? There's no room
for you, okay? Not tonight. Come on.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.266
Well, that's cool. I'll catch up with
you guys. It's a small car, anyway.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.934
You guys have fun.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.695
Not now, Gary.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.483
Sorry.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.058
Give me a minute.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.892
Damn it. Why won't she turn?

17:19.704 --> 17:22.935
- I think it's gotta cool down.
- Yugo.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.567
Yeah, you don't see many of these
Easter eggs on the road.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.906
Yeah. Once you buy one
you see them everywhere.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.880
Oh, yeah? It's pretty small.
In mint condition, though.

17:33.085 --> 17:36.748
Yeah. This is the result of a lot
of time and care.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.779
Unfortunately.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.527
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.719
Are you off-duty?

17:45.931 --> 17:47.796
It's not a cab, my friend, I promise you.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.297
Okay, don't get mad.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.594
I wasn't getting mad.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.637
What is that?

17:58.844 --> 18:01.210
It's not as ominous as it seems.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.108
I told you they look cute together.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.277
Okay, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go give Nicky a pep talk.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.953
Dev, clean up the girl.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.356
Nick. I had a feeling
you two might get stuck.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.527
- Having some trouble?
- Stalled again?

18:15.727 --> 18:18.355
Hi, Thom. Hi, beefy guy.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.299
- Lady friend.
- Yes?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.663
Dev could use your assistance
in the van, if you please. Thank you.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.996
In the van?

18:26.205 --> 18:30.005
In the van. Large vehicle right there?
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

18:39.218 --> 18:40.583
Hi.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.810
Try this.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.846
What?

18:44.056 --> 18:46.422
Let's just say we're not the biggest
fans of his ex.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.355
And we've decided
you're to be his salvation.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.729
Besides, we saw you two making out,
and we think you're the one.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.394
We just gotta get you
out of that sports bra.

18:59.071 --> 19:03.508
- This isn't a sports bra.
- Come on. We're all ladies here.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.371
<i>Are you seriously
talking about Tris right now?</i>

19:07.579 --> 19:10.776
I think this might be my opportunity
to get some answers, you know?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.747
Do not talk to this girl
about Tris, Nicky. I mean it.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.920
Look, we'll take
the drunk mess home.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.386
You kids go find Fluffy, text us
when you do and we'll meet you there.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.183
What could possibly go wrong?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.057
Okay.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.693
Oh, it's better than the uni-boob.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.363
Thanks a lot.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.208
This isn't gonna work, okay?
He's hung up on Tris.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.642
You look gorgeous.
And let me tell you something:

19:42.848 --> 19:47.410
Nicky is definitely worth the underwire.
He just needs a little push, that's all.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.453
Shit.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.328
Oh, God. I gotta get my friend home.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.963
- We'll do it.
- What?

20:00.165 --> 20:03.498
We'll do it. Go find Fluffy.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.135
Go.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.931
- Hey, unlock the door, please.
- Hi, hello?

20:08.140 --> 20:11.769
Caroline? Honey, can you hear me?

20:12.344 --> 20:13.470
Aren't you a sweet thing?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.114
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Wake up.

20:17.316 --> 20:18.783
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Get out.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.748
Please be careful. This is not a toy.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.783
- Can you...?
- You just need to be quiet.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.310
Unlock the door, bitch.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.375
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm right here.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.946
Caroline. Just like we practiced.
Go like this.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.514
I'm right here.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.653
- You don't have to yell at me.
- Go like that. Up, up a little.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.043
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.890
- Everybody, move along. Thank you.
- I got her.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.519
- All right.
- I did it.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.665
- I can see the head.
- Come with me. Come with me.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.567
I got her.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.329
Okay. Nobody look.

21:14.539 --> 21:15.528
I got her.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.505
If you touch one hair on her head,
I will kill all of you.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.737
Norah, I'm being carried.
You look so...

21:23.682 --> 21:24.740
She'll be okay.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.315
Is she conscious?

21:27.019 --> 21:29.749
She'll be okay.
They're not gonna kill her.

21:31.556 --> 21:32.989
Eyes up here.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.876
So where do you think Fluffy's
gonna be?

21:56.081 --> 21:58.879
- Should we try Mercury Lounge?
- Yeah, that's good.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.848
But you know Fluffy's not going on
till super late, though.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.023
So I guess we have some time
to kill, then.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.396
So...

22:17.903 --> 22:20.133
...your friends are all gay, right?

22:20.872 --> 22:21.861
Not all my friends.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.136
Not all your friends,
but the ones in the van are gay?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.869
Yeah, I mean, they're all gay. Yeah.

22:28.080 --> 22:32.540
One hundred percent, you know, gay.
Gay every day, all the time.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.582
Okay. That's a relief.

22:34.786 --> 22:38.415
If anyone's gonna get raped
in that van, it will be a guy.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.117
That's good.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.151
You wanna get a drink or something?

22:43.595 --> 22:46.291
- I don't drink at all.
- I don't either.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.864
You don't?
Are you straightedge like I am?

22:49.067 --> 22:52.002
I don't really subscribe to any label.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.903
Fine.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.673
Hey. What's that banging?

23:06.551 --> 23:10.954
- Is it my car?
- I think it's drums. Get it?

23:11.523 --> 23:14.287
Get it? Rhythm?
Rhythmic drumming on drums?

23:14.493 --> 23:16.552
Because when you're in a band,
you need drums.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.855
And you're in a band,
and you don't have drums.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.190
Thanks.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.132
I haven't heard that before.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.833
I didn't mean your band wasn't good.
I just meant you need a drummer.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.634
You can just drop me off up here
if you want.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.603
- Yo. Yo.
- Oh, my God.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.304
Taxi. Yeah.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.285
- Hi.
- Hey. Bowery Ballroom.

23:41.486 --> 23:44.284
No, I'm not a cab, sir.
I'm not a cab. I'm not a cab.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.487
- It's so good to be alone.
- Finally.

23:48.493 --> 23:51.360
- Bowery Ballroom?
- You made that happen.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.929
Oh, God, yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.464
- I do that?
- Yeah, you do that.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.483
- So are you from Englewood?
- Yep.

24:18.056 --> 24:20.251
Englewood, up to no good.

24:22.260 --> 24:26.594
- I'm from Hoboken.
- Hoboken, no joking. What?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.495
- I love you.
- I love you.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.670
I love you so much it's retarded.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.708
So are you going off to college?

24:38.376 --> 24:39.502
You smell so good.

24:39.711 --> 24:43.044
- I don't know. I got into Brown.
- Oh, you smell like soap.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.513
But I have this job lined up here
which is...

24:46.952 --> 24:49.250
I don't know,
and I have to make up my mind fast...

24:49.454 --> 24:52.582
...because they're only holding
my spot at Brown until tomorrow.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.249
- I'm going to Berklee School of Music.
- Oh, yeah?

24:56.461 --> 24:58.622
- It's in Boston.
- That's awesome.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.458
If you went to Brown,
we'd only be an hour away.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.963
Yes.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.224
What's wrong?

25:04.436 --> 25:06.131
- Cramp.
- What? What? Hold on.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.432
- My hand's stuck in the seat belt.
- Cramp, cramp, cramp. Cramp.

25:14.412 --> 25:16.972
Okay, last stop. Get out, please.

25:17.582 --> 25:20.551
- What do I owe you?
- It's $8.50.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.914
- There you go, man.
- Okay.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.052
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay. Careful, now.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.890
- Oh, my God.
- All right, hey.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.897
Cherish one another, folks.

25:33.098 --> 25:34.656
Don't slam my door, please.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.966
Nice folks. Charged a little extra
for the cleanup.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.671
That's gonna be fun.

25:44.142 --> 25:47.270
Thanks for sticking that out with me.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.143
Yeah.

26:01.526 --> 26:02.993
<i>So that's it, Tris.</i>

26:03.194 --> 26:06.652
<i>That's the breakup mix.
Ten songs from my broken...</i>

26:07.065 --> 26:09.158
That was not even real.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.271
Can we go straight
to laughing about this?

26:13.471 --> 26:15.302
- I have to pee.
- Okay.

26:16.808 --> 26:17.866
Go pee.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.713
- Hey, how you been?
- Hi.

26:38.063 --> 26:41.430
Caroline, pick up the phone.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.669
Caroline.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.709
Look, Dev, I am sick and tired
of arguing about our band's name.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.248
- What about Shit Sandwich?
- What about Shit Sandwich?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.011
We are Shit Sandwich.

27:03.221 --> 27:05.655
Whatever happened to Dickache?
I liked Dickache.

27:05.857 --> 27:09.190
- I got it. What about The Tight Ends?
- Going Balls Deep.

27:29.948 --> 27:32.974
Norah! Norah! Norah!

28:02.180 --> 28:03.807
Brooklyn Pool. I got a clue.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.381
Hey. You are not gonna believe this.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.092
So can't we talk about
how cool Fluffy is?

28:18.296 --> 28:21.663
- They're my favorite band in the world.
- They're my favorite band.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.959
I've gotten so many people
into that band.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.158
Me too.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.533
I had a bootleg of "Black Carnage"
before anybody else ever heard it.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.641
I was the first person
outside of the band to hear that song.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.538
- Okay. Yeah.
- I'm sure that I was.

28:33.745 --> 28:35.542
We went to see them
at the Elbow Room.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.612
- Yes?
- And it was a total bait and switch.

28:37.816 --> 28:41.183
- Are You Randy showed up instead.
- That literally makes me wanna die.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.787
Yeah, I hate those guys. I was the one
that got her into Where's Fluffy.

28:44.989 --> 28:45.978
It was me.

28:46.191 --> 28:49.752
She'd never even heard of them until I
put one of their songs on a CD for her.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.657
- Tris. I'm talking about Tris.
- Is that right?

28:52.864 --> 28:56.231
How well do you know each other?
You go to Sacred Heart together or?

28:56.434 --> 29:00.962
Do you guys talk a lot?
Talk about her new boyfriend?

29:01.172 --> 29:05.973
I cannot believe Tris dated a
straightedge. That's, like, astounding.

29:06.177 --> 29:09.044
What did she say about me?
She said I was a straightedge?

29:09.247 --> 29:12.216
Can I ask, what did you see
in her? I could floss with that girl.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.816
This is your friend?

29:14.018 --> 29:17.351
All right. I'm the bad guy now. This
what we're doing? I'm the bad guy?

29:17.555 --> 29:20.956
If you really wanna know, she actually
supported our music and our band...

29:21.159 --> 29:24.322
...when nobody else did,
not that that's any of your business.

29:24.662 --> 29:27.222
- Okay, forget it. I can't do this.
- Do what?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.560
Just make a U-turn and take me back
to Ludlow. I'll find my own way.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.703
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag...

29:32.904 --> 29:34.838
...at your party.
- You don't have to yell.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.064
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.334
- Just drop me off.
- I will.

29:39.544 --> 29:40.602
Oh, my God!

29:46.751 --> 29:48.275
Are you crazy?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.183
I don't know what I did
to make you so angry.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.619
- Nothing. You're ridiculous.
- You don't know me.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.622
- I know you. I know your make.
- My make?

29:55.827 --> 29:57.761
You're an emo-band boy,
obsessed with Tris?

29:57.962 --> 30:00.726
They could make action figures of you.
Drummer not included.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.923
It's funny that Tris
never mentioned you.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.399
But she did mention some frigid,
jealous JAP that was jealous of her...

30:06.604 --> 30:09.266
...and who was a complete bitch.
- Oh, jealous? Oh, really?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.170
- I know who she was referring to.
- Let's dance, douche bag.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.436
Sweetheart,
you think you have something to...

30:14.646 --> 30:16.910
I am not jealous!

30:17.849 --> 30:20.977
Oh, no, man, she's not jealous.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.320
Awesome. Awesome night.

30:30.528 --> 30:33.554
<i>- So how's it going?
- It was great until she choked me out.</i>

30:33.765 --> 30:36.165
<i>- Kinky.
- What's up with you guys?</i>

30:36.367 --> 30:38.358
Well, everything's fine here,
Nick. Peachy.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.368
<i>- It's just we sort of kind of lost the girl.
- What girl?</i>

30:41.573 --> 30:42.870
You know, the girl.

30:43.908 --> 30:44.897
What?

30:45.109 --> 30:47.976
<i>Yeah, well, we came to
Gray's Papaya to grab a bite to eat...</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:50.670
<i>...and she must've woke up.
The chick's flown the coop.</i>

30:50.882 --> 30:54.079
<i>- Thom, that's not acceptable.
- I know.</i>

30:54.285 --> 30:56.776
So the shitbox stall again?
You want us to pick you up?

30:56.988 --> 30:58.216
Thom, you have to find her.

30:58.423 --> 31:01.756
<i>We already looked everywhere,
Nicky. She's not in the van.</i>

31:01.960 --> 31:04.986
<i>She's not in Gray's Papaya.
She's gone.</i>

31:06.197 --> 31:11.134
So I think now is the time
we cut our losses and go find Fluffy.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.998
<i>Right? Hello, Nicky?</i>

31:17.842 --> 31:19.935
Hey, Tal, it's me. Where are you?

31:20.945 --> 31:22.845
<i>- Hey.
- Norah?</i>

31:23.047 --> 31:24.674
They lost Caroline.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.148
What?

31:28.453 --> 31:29.477
<i>Norah?</i>

31:38.529 --> 31:39.587
You kids been drinking?

31:39.797 --> 31:40.786
- No.
- No.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.160
Why not?
We're having a search party.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.029
Search party!

31:45.837 --> 31:46.826
God.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.395
Party.

31:49.607 --> 31:53.008
Search party, N.Y.C.
Search party, N.Y.C.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.744
Caroline, where the hell
can you be?

31:56.981 --> 31:58.710
- Caroline.
- Caroline.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.680
Caroline.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.182
Caroline.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.477
Caroline!

32:04.689 --> 32:06.418
Guys, we need to be adults right now.

32:06.624 --> 32:10.287
- I don't have $ 11.
- How much do you have?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.193
- Total?
- Yeah.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.329
One dollar.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.572
One dollar won't get you to Newark.

32:27.178 --> 32:31.171
Oh, no, no. I didn't say
I wanted to go to Newark.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.212
That's so funny.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.850
Okay. I'm just gonna
tell you something.

32:40.058 --> 32:42.754
I was kidnapped tonight. Seriously.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.920
In this van with these guys
talking about going balls deep.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.325
Sounds like fun, right?
Not always. Scary.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.066
I just think the Jerk Offs
isn't hardcore enough.

32:59.277 --> 33:02.405
We are not calling ourselves
Shit Sandwich, and that is final.

33:02.613 --> 33:06.014
I want my stepfather to have the
possibility of seeing one of our shows.

33:06.217 --> 33:09.118
Yeah, well, I'm a third of this group,
too, Thom, if not more.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.483
- How are you more?
- I'm the lead singer.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.153
- You all right?
- I can't believe...

33:19.364 --> 33:21.594
...I'm missing Where's Fluffy
for this.

33:23.634 --> 33:26.899
- Where's Fluffy? Where?
- Well, supposedly at Brooklyn Pool.

33:28.139 --> 33:30.937
We can't go, because we
need to relocate the entire person...

33:31.142 --> 33:32.404
...you guys managed to lose.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.937
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, come on.

33:35.146 --> 33:38.479
Okay. Listen, she's probably there.
I mean, the chick likes to party.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.877
I say we do a drive-by.

33:41.052 --> 33:44.215
No. Absolutely not. No drive-bys.

33:44.922 --> 33:48.050
Look, the sooner we find Caroline,
the sooner we can find Fluffy...

33:48.259 --> 33:49.988
...and the sooner this
will be over.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.225
Okay.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.525
You know,
if you don't have a drummer...

33:57.735 --> 34:01.398
...then why do you have drums,
you fistful of assholes?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.736
Fistful of Assholes.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.911
I like it.

34:20.824 --> 34:23.793
Hi, I'm Caroline. What's your name?

34:27.799 --> 34:29.858
That's okay,
you don't have to tell me.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.527
It's been, like, one of those nights,
you know?

34:33.938 --> 34:36.168
I was with my friend Norah,
who you don't know...

34:36.373 --> 34:39.342
...but you would really like her
because everybody likes Norah...

34:39.543 --> 34:43.275
...and she left me tonight, which is...
She never does that.

34:43.481 --> 34:44.971
And then I was kidnapped.

34:46.150 --> 34:49.313
And then she...
Usually when I go home with her...

34:49.520 --> 34:53.286
...she makes me a turkey sandwich
when I get home...

34:53.491 --> 34:56.289
...but I might never get home,
you know?

34:57.662 --> 34:59.926
And I'm so tired.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.508
Is that a turkey sandwich?

35:17.281 --> 35:18.509
It is.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.317
Can you hold this for me?

35:30.027 --> 35:31.756
Thank you so much.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.655
Oh, my God.

35:34.632 --> 35:35.656
Hi.

35:48.012 --> 35:50.003
I just need my gum.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.421
Okay, Englewood.

36:03.628 --> 36:07.029
Okay. Well, the last bus to Englewood
left seven minutes ago.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.222
You see? She's fine. Let's go.

36:09.433 --> 36:13.665
No, just because there was a last bus
doesn't mean she was on the last bus.

36:13.871 --> 36:16.271
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.319
I'll get it.

36:44.602 --> 36:45.967
- Norah.
- Caro...

36:47.038 --> 36:48.505
Oh, no.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.581
Oh, God.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.182
Norah?

37:09.894 --> 37:12.124
- Help me.
- Caroline, where are you?

37:12.330 --> 37:14.457
<i>- Tell me where you are.
- Norah, my gum.</i>

37:14.665 --> 37:17.657
What? Can you hear me? Caroline?

37:18.502 --> 37:20.129
Norah.

37:21.772 --> 37:23.535
Norah, where are you?

37:23.741 --> 37:25.936
<i>- Can you hear me? Caroline?
- Norah?</i>

37:27.678 --> 37:29.270
- Shit.
- Where is she?

37:29.480 --> 37:31.812
I don't know.
I couldn't hear over the music.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.357
Music? What music?

37:47.565 --> 37:50.056
She's at Brooklyn Pool.
She's probably looking for you.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.462
- In Brooklyn?
- Let's go.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.701
To Brooklyn?

37:57.475 --> 37:59.340
Fine, let's go to Brooklyn.

38:58.235 --> 39:00.226
- This is awesome.
- This is ridiculous.

39:00.438 --> 39:03.339
Okay, what are we supposed to do
if she's not here, you guys?

39:03.541 --> 39:06.271
When she's not here,
because she's not, obviously.

39:06.477 --> 39:09.173
Hello. How you doing? Hi.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.871
- Everybody in. Pile on in.
- Really? Are you sure?

39:12.083 --> 39:13.175
There you go.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.394
- No.
- I've been here for an hour.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.051
No, you can't get in.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.499
Hey, were you on YouTube
or something?

39:38.709 --> 39:39.698
What?

39:40.211 --> 39:41.644
Who are you?

39:42.079 --> 39:43.546
I'm Norah.

39:44.415 --> 39:47.907
I'm no one.
I'm just the daughter of someone.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.416
Daughter of who?

39:50.020 --> 39:52.716
My dad. I'm gonna
go find Caroline, okay?

39:52.990 --> 39:54.480
Yeah, good luck.

39:55.926 --> 39:56.984
That's my song.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.424
Really? It's my song kind of.
Really? That's cool.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.063
You dance?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.359
Can we dance like this?

40:04.335 --> 40:07.668
When they wrote this song, they were
hoping people would dance like this.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.274
Go like this.
You're not supposed to actually...

40:13.477 --> 40:16.537
Try and get as close to my hands
as you can without touching them.

40:17.281 --> 40:20.478
- This is a very good dance, Nick.
- This is the pedal boat.

40:32.229 --> 40:34.129
You know the blow-dryer?

40:36.867 --> 40:38.129
- Okay.
- Doesn't work on mine.

40:38.335 --> 40:40.496
Oh, no, it doesn't. Wow, you're soft.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.969
I asked for the Ellen DeGeneres
haircut.

40:45.342 --> 40:46.502
Oh, my God.

40:47.678 --> 40:48.804
Hey. Oh, hey.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.806
Dance-wich.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.480
- He's pushing me. I'm not doing it.
- It's okay.

40:54.685 --> 40:55.913
- It's not me.
- It's all him.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.089
He's making me do it.
I'm not doing it.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.884
It's not your fault. It's all right.
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.184
Hi there.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.193
Oh, hi.

41:09.366 --> 41:10.355
Hey, baby.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.763
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

41:12.970 --> 41:15.063
Looking for Fluffy.
What are you doing here?

41:15.272 --> 41:16.637
We're looking for Caroline.

41:16.841 --> 41:20.868
Oh, Caroline. What, can't you just
follow the umbilical cord?

41:22.913 --> 41:25.074
- What's up?
- Hi.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.512
Nick, this is Tal. Tal, this is Nick,
Tris' latest victim.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.186
Oh, serious?

41:32.590 --> 41:35.684
Well... Oh, but you're in that
gay band...

41:36.760 --> 41:37.818
...We're Gay.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.087
The Jerk Offs.
And we're not all gay.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.094
Yeah. You were pretty decent.

41:42.299 --> 41:46.531
Except for being one arm short
of a Def Leppard cover group.

41:48.105 --> 41:50.335
All right, yeah, take care, fellas.

41:51.141 --> 41:52.733
You guys were pretty good except...

41:52.943 --> 41:57.277
...you were two penises short of
a Shania Twain re-imagination band.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.470
You're done.

41:58.682 --> 42:03.346
Prettiest shoulders, prettiest hair,
prettiest ears.

42:04.488 --> 42:06.388
- Thanks.
- Gorgeous ears.

42:07.958 --> 42:09.391
Here we go.

42:09.627 --> 42:11.993
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

42:12.196 --> 42:14.721
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

42:27.444 --> 42:28.741
Yes.

42:28.946 --> 42:30.277
Fluffy!

42:33.117 --> 42:37.247
Okay. The hype man
knows what you want...

42:37.454 --> 42:39.581
...but he's not sure
if you want it enough.

42:40.624 --> 42:42.421
Do you really want it?

42:42.893 --> 42:46.260
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?

42:46.463 --> 42:48.158
I said, do you really want it?

42:49.600 --> 42:50.862
I got one question.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.391
Are...

42:53.370 --> 42:54.462
...You...

42:55.372 --> 42:57.101
...Randy?

42:58.008 --> 42:58.997
You suck.

43:00.044 --> 43:01.841
- Damn it.
- The bait and switch.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.276
- Randy, you suck.
- Go ahead.

43:12.990 --> 43:17.017
So, listen, baby,
what are you doing tonight?

43:17.227 --> 43:21.459
Aside from you being beautiful. I got
something I really want you to hear.

43:21.665 --> 43:23.826
Look here. I need to talk to you
right now.

43:24.034 --> 43:26.594
I got some important stuff
I need to talk to you about.

43:26.804 --> 43:28.863
Okay, well, I'm gonna...

43:29.573 --> 43:31.302
You have fun, okay?

43:33.177 --> 43:35.304
I'm just gonna go find Caroline, okay?

43:35.913 --> 43:38.541
You're just gonna call me
in 45 minutes anyways.

43:39.383 --> 43:40.873
With a gay band.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.007
- Hi.
- Hey.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.050
Thanks.

44:24.795 --> 44:26.023
Come on.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.428
I thought we were gonna...

44:30.134 --> 44:34.036
No, we're not, we're gonna...
Just get in the cab, Gary, come on.

44:37.241 --> 44:38.230
Follow that van.

44:56.460 --> 44:59.327
- So is that guy your boyfriend?
- Sort of.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.431
He's sort of your boyfriend,
or he's your sort-of boyfriend?

45:02.633 --> 45:05.261
He's sort of my ex-boyfriend,
most of the time.

45:05.469 --> 45:08.165
- What is he the rest of the time?
- We're friends.

45:08.372 --> 45:11.432
- With benefits?
- Yeah, it's just the never-ending story.

45:12.109 --> 45:14.839
- That's like me and Tris.
- No, that ended, remember?

45:15.946 --> 45:16.935
I mean...

45:17.147 --> 45:20.446
Excuse me, you have a boyfriend
or an ex-boyfriend with benefits...

45:20.651 --> 45:23.279
...but you still go around
kissing total strangers?

45:23.487 --> 45:25.955
Trust me, that was an act
of desperation.

45:26.156 --> 45:28.056
Oh, yeah, okay.
Seemed pretty desperate.

45:28.258 --> 45:30.749
Oh, okay. Well, Nick,
you're not a total stranger, huh?

45:30.961 --> 45:33.930
In fact, I am rife
with too much information.

45:35.099 --> 45:36.088
What does that mean?

45:36.300 --> 45:38.894
Okay, hi. I hate to break up
the love-fest back there...

45:39.103 --> 45:41.833
...but does anyone wanna tell us
where we're going?

45:42.439 --> 45:45.306
- I can narrow this down.
- Well, let's hear it, sister.

45:45.509 --> 45:48.103
You know how some people like to eat
in the same places?

45:48.312 --> 45:49.609
Yes.

45:49.813 --> 45:52.441
Okay, Caroline likes to barf
in the same places.

46:02.392 --> 46:04.952
Hey, we're gonna get a hot dog
around the corner.

46:14.471 --> 46:18.100
- Oh, no. No more. No more.
- Have you seen her?

46:18.308 --> 46:20.799
Your girlfriend puked
in the ice cream again.

46:21.011 --> 46:23.343
Last time it took me one hour
to chip out.

46:26.416 --> 46:28.179
Hey. Hey.

46:29.153 --> 46:31.178
Thought you got a ride home.

46:31.388 --> 46:33.686
- What, do you like him or something?
- Do you?

46:33.924 --> 46:36.916
Well, I was with the guy
for six months, so...

46:37.127 --> 46:39.186
And you cheated on him
for six months, so...

46:39.396 --> 46:43.059
- You didn't tell him that, did you?
- No, I didn't tell him that.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.689
Good.

46:44.902 --> 46:47.928
- I just feel like she's messing with me.
- Who are we talking about?

46:48.839 --> 46:53.572
Right now, Norah. No, Tris. Tris.

46:53.777 --> 46:56.610
- You just haven't figured it out yet.
- What?

46:57.181 --> 46:59.877
It. You know, it, the big picture.

47:01.051 --> 47:02.382
I guess not.

47:02.586 --> 47:03.780
The Beatles.

47:06.590 --> 47:09.582
- What about them?
- This.

47:10.260 --> 47:13.058
Look, other bands,
they wanna make it about sex or pain.

47:13.263 --> 47:15.823
But, you know, the Beatles,
they had it all figured out.

47:16.033 --> 47:20.026
"I Wanna Hold Your Hand. " That's the
first single. It's F-ing brilliant, right?

47:20.971 --> 47:26.204
The guy actually cried. I mean, I made
guys cry before, but I really broke him.

47:26.410 --> 47:28.207
And I'm saying this
for the both of you.

47:28.412 --> 47:30.243
I mean, I don't wanna
see you get hurt...

47:30.447 --> 47:33.416
...but I don't wanna see him get
any more hurt, either, you know?

47:33.617 --> 47:35.107
What do you mean?

47:35.319 --> 47:37.913
Word on the street is
you never had an orgasm.

47:40.424 --> 47:42.551
Because that's what
everybody wants, Nicky.

47:42.759 --> 47:44.727
They don't want a 24-hour
hump sesh.

47:44.928 --> 47:48.659
They don't wanna be married to you
for a hundred years.

47:48.866 --> 47:52.267
They just wanna hold your hand.

47:57.941 --> 47:59.875
I'm gonna stop doing that.

48:00.878 --> 48:04.336
Tris? So who was on the street when
you heard this "word on the street"?

48:04.548 --> 48:05.776
Was Caroline on the street?

48:05.983 --> 48:08.975
It's okay. I mean, some people
just can't have one.

48:10.287 --> 48:13.188
I can have one. Okay?

48:13.390 --> 48:15.950
I've probably had, like,
a million in my life, so...

48:16.159 --> 48:17.524
Oh, sure, yeah.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.923
How am I supposed to know,
you know?

48:20.130 --> 48:22.098
Oh, you'd know.

48:24.801 --> 48:28.328
Look, I'm just afraid that if he gets
with you and nothing happens...

48:28.538 --> 48:31.996
...his self-esteem could really
go through the crapper, you know?

48:35.312 --> 48:38.611
- This is Tris.
- Oh, hey, bitch. It's Caroline.

48:38.815 --> 48:41.784
- What? Give me the phone.
- Wait, what do you mean, kidnapped?

48:41.985 --> 48:44.510
- Why didn't she call me?
- You're totally grounded.

48:44.721 --> 48:47.019
- Give it to me.
- Hold on.

48:47.724 --> 48:50.158
Where are you? We've been looking
for you everywhere.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.852
<i>- Norah? I found Jesus.
- What?</i>

48:54.064 --> 48:57.329
Jesus! He's much taller in person.

48:58.001 --> 49:00.162
<i>I'm at a church, I think.</i>

49:00.370 --> 49:05.672
<i>- It's so churchy and beautiful.
- It's a church. Okay, which church?</i>

49:05.876 --> 49:09.505
- Norah, I have to follow Jesus now.
- No, Caroline...

49:09.713 --> 49:11.544
There's an altar boy
with no pants on.

49:11.748 --> 49:13.909
Why do you have no pants on,
altar boy?

49:16.053 --> 49:18.180
Great. I have to find Jesus now.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.990
- Nor?
- Yeah?

49:21.591 --> 49:24.025
- My phone.
- Here.

49:42.412 --> 49:43.504
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:44.247 --> 49:45.544
You all right?

49:46.450 --> 49:47.439
Is she okay?

49:48.385 --> 49:49.374
Yeah.

49:50.787 --> 49:52.550
I got a clue, guys.

49:53.423 --> 49:56.187
- Are we done?
- One last stop.

49:58.862 --> 50:01.387
A Yugo. We're looking for a Yugo.

50:02.099 --> 50:05.159
- She said a church.
- All right, let me check it out.

50:25.055 --> 50:26.079
What's wrong?

50:27.424 --> 50:28.721
Tris is what's wrong.

50:28.925 --> 50:33.157
Tris? Please. That girl's got nothing
on you. I mean, for one, she's awful.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.352
Awful.

50:34.564 --> 50:36.998
- Yeah. And for two, you're amazing.
- Amazing.

50:43.607 --> 50:44.904
Yeah, well.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.879
- Hey.
- Sorry, sorry.

50:53.083 --> 50:55.176
- I'm sleeping here.
- You trying to take my BLT?

50:55.385 --> 50:57.410
- It's cool, Switzerland. I got this.
- Hey.

50:57.621 --> 51:00.647
- What's up, friend? How you doing?
- Good. I was just gonna go in...

51:00.857 --> 51:02.882
- You walked right in here.
- I didn't mean to.

51:03.093 --> 51:05.186
You're like a little canary
in skinny jeans.

51:05.395 --> 51:07.329
I was gonna go in
to look for my friend.

51:07.531 --> 51:10.796
You got friends right here. Me and
Switzerland are here for you, baby.

51:11.001 --> 51:13.868
Let me ask you a question.
You ever hook up with a dog?

51:14.071 --> 51:17.336
No. What? Like an an...
A dog, like a pet? No.

51:17.541 --> 51:21.170
Don't. It's not worth it.
I like you so much.

51:21.378 --> 51:25.678
- I'm running away. I'm running.
- Run away. Run away, little canary.

51:26.083 --> 51:29.314
Okay. Okay.
What exactly did she say to you?

51:30.087 --> 51:32.146
Something about an altar boy
with no pants.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.152
I don't know
what she was talking about.

51:34.357 --> 51:37.190
Midnight Ass. The all-male
"holigay" revue at Camera Obscura.

51:37.394 --> 51:40.625
"Deck the Balls," "O Horny Night. "
You guys never went to that?

51:40.831 --> 51:42.560
A Christmas show
at this time of year?

51:42.766 --> 51:45.394
Since when does a queen
need an excuse to sing?

51:52.342 --> 51:53.331
Go, girl.

52:28.011 --> 52:29.273
- Did you find her?
- No.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.184
Merry Christmas.

52:38.255 --> 52:41.588
Norah. Happy Hanukkah, Norah!

52:41.791 --> 52:43.554
I made it to Broadway.

52:43.760 --> 52:45.853
- I'll get her.
- Thanks.

52:46.329 --> 52:48.593
This tree is drunk.

52:48.798 --> 52:53.132
Norah, it's Yugo.
He came to rescue me.

52:58.675 --> 53:02.372
It's right here, right here.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Right here.

53:10.453 --> 53:12.546
I'll text you. Okay?

53:14.357 --> 53:16.325
Want us to take you
back to the Yugo, Nicky?

53:16.526 --> 53:17.515
Yeah, sure.

53:22.732 --> 53:25.496
- The bass is really good.
- Thank you.

53:29.606 --> 53:31.733
- You okay?
- No.

53:33.043 --> 53:37.503
- You guys must be really good friends.
- Yes, I am a great friend.

53:37.714 --> 53:42.310
It's always been like this. I'm the head
squire in Caroline's quest for attention.

53:45.121 --> 53:46.418
That's gross.

53:47.257 --> 53:50.556
You wanna...
I got one of these things.

53:53.496 --> 53:54.656
You have a Handi Wipe?

53:55.665 --> 53:57.360
Kind of handy.

53:58.435 --> 53:59.868
What a gentleman.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.298
Yeah, I...

54:01.504 --> 54:05.600
We had Chinese food, like,
three weeks ago, and I haven't used it.

54:06.743 --> 54:10.110
I never wash my pants.
I like to keep the night on them.

54:17.187 --> 54:20.452
I've been thinking more
about Brown.

54:20.657 --> 54:21.988
Yeah.

54:22.192 --> 54:25.355
I think it'd be nice
to know someone an hour away.

54:26.630 --> 54:27.619
Yeah.

54:29.833 --> 54:33.564
I really wouldn't mind getting away
from my minion duties.

54:42.679 --> 54:45.978
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

55:03.033 --> 55:05.797
Maybe I should just go
deal with it right now.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.901
- Well, how will you get home?
- Nicky.

55:12.108 --> 55:15.373
We'll get home fine.
You guys can still drop us off, right?

55:16.579 --> 55:18.240
Yeah.

55:28.224 --> 55:29.384
Nick.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.925
Nice meeting you.

56:02.125 --> 56:04.252
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:04.494 --> 56:07.930
- What are you doing here?
- You know what I'm doing here.

56:08.131 --> 56:09.621
No, I really don't.

56:11.801 --> 56:14.929
Well, it wasn't hard to find
the only Yugo in the city.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.368
I think it's the only Yugo
in the country.

56:18.475 --> 56:21.000
Aren't you gonna
open the door for me?

56:21.211 --> 56:25.170
- Well, where are we going?
- You're giving me a ride home.

56:25.982 --> 56:28.382
Why don't you get a ride
from that new guy?

56:28.818 --> 56:31.082
Well, he doesn't have a Yugo.

56:34.290 --> 56:38.693
It's just a ride. It's late. Please?

56:41.297 --> 56:42.286
Okay.

56:53.009 --> 56:55.273
- Here.
- But I don't want your gum.

56:55.478 --> 56:57.571
Just take it. God.

57:07.957 --> 57:09.982
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Tal.</i>

57:10.193 --> 57:12.320
<i>Norah.</i>

57:12.929 --> 57:14.226
Where are you?

57:20.937 --> 57:26.034
You should go. I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me. Go.

57:27.877 --> 57:29.708
Okay.

57:32.682 --> 57:33.808
Bye.

57:34.017 --> 57:35.951
Have fun. I love you.

57:36.152 --> 57:37.983
I miss you already.

57:42.325 --> 57:44.850
You guys got directions?
You know where you're going?

57:45.061 --> 57:47.359
- Yeah, we got them.
- Okay. No stopping.

57:47.564 --> 57:49.429
No stopping for anything.

57:49.632 --> 57:52.863
I don't care if Brad Pitt is selling fruit
in a thong on the GW.

57:53.069 --> 57:56.937
- You cannot stop, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know.

57:58.041 --> 58:02.535
Well, good night,
my hetero heroine.

58:03.246 --> 58:05.737
Good night, Dev. Good night, Thom.

58:06.850 --> 58:08.545
It was a really fun night.

58:09.352 --> 58:11.547
God, I don't know
what your name is.

58:13.389 --> 58:14.913
It's Lethario.

58:17.861 --> 58:19.123
Nice.

58:32.675 --> 58:35.143
- There you are, yay.
- Hi.

58:37.881 --> 58:39.746
- You made it.
- Yes.

58:39.949 --> 58:41.917
You graced us with your presence.

58:42.385 --> 58:44.546
You're the coolest girl ever.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.578
- You wanna come have a seat?
- Yes.

58:46.789 --> 58:49.053
- Okay, come. Step.
- Hi.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.248
- Hey there.
- Hey.

58:52.762 --> 58:55.788
So did you ever find Winehouse?

58:55.999 --> 58:58.160
- Yes. And you don't wanna know.
- Yeah?

58:58.368 --> 58:59.699
Don't even ask.

58:59.903 --> 59:02.770
You're gonna be an amazing mother
one day.

59:04.307 --> 59:05.934
Thanks. I guess so.

59:06.910 --> 59:08.707
What is this jacket?

59:09.279 --> 59:11.213
Who is Salvatore?

59:11.414 --> 59:13.905
I got something to be worried
about here?

59:14.250 --> 59:15.979
- It's just a jacket.
- Yeah?

59:16.185 --> 59:17.516
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:31.634 --> 59:33.932
I feel so safe here.

59:34.404 --> 59:37.237
Like when I was a kid driving home
with my parents...

59:37.440 --> 59:40.534
...from some trip somewhere...

59:40.743 --> 59:45.373
...and I couldn't help
but fall asleep because that car...

59:45.582 --> 59:47.812
...like I was already home.

59:48.418 --> 59:52.548
And that's how you feel, Nicky.
Like I'm already home.

59:56.659 --> 01:00:00.789
Look, your car misses me.
It's falling apart without me.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:03.965
But you just did that.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.395
Oh, come on.

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.333
Are you really over me?

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:14.099
You wouldn't have to get over me
if you were still under me.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:15.833
Yeah.

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.002
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.578
What?

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.807
Just, you know, I'm driving.
And try not...

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:24.919
Let's go down by the river. Right here.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:38.157
- I'm very glad you came to see me.
- Me too.

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.426
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.164
You know, I brought a present
for you.

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:47.036
What? You didn't have to get me
any present.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.609
<i>So the history of the name,
Oz- rael...</i>

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:58.082
...it's like anarchy meets Zionism,
you know. It's ironic.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:02.781
Oh, man. You think Israel's ready
for all this Jew fire?

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.051
Are you kidding me?
We bring the Jew fire.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.419
So...

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.029
...do you like it?

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.190
Yeah?

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.428
Serious? Oh, that means so much.

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.833
That means so much.
Thank you so much. Really?

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.532
Really? Oh, thank you.

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:24.372
And you think your dad will like it?

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:31.381
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, what?

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.920
- No. Did they just charge us?
- What?

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.424
Did they just charge us?
What the hell?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.255
Could you please talk to someone
about this, please?

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:47.935
- About that? Sure.
- Yeah? Really?

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.900
Yeah. Sit tight.

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:54.800
Thank you.
You're the coolest girl ever.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.843
Excuse me.

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.577
I think you meant two zeros,
not one.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.208
Thank you.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:25.102
I've been kind of getting some
mixed signals from you lately.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:26.866
Yeah?

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.039
Sort of.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.551
Clears that up.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.658
That's my song.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.320
Yeah.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.679
Hey.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.350
Hey, Nick.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.325
Are you kidding me?

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.561
Gary?

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.994
Assorted meat plate?

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.470
Great. Just keep it coming.
Thank you.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.784
Nicholas' phone.

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.819
<i>Hi, is Nick there?</i>

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:31.221
No, he's not. Would you like
to call back for his voice mail?

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.395
<i>Can I just leave a message?</i>

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.262
Yeah, but if I need a pen,
you're shit out of luck.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.258
Could you tell him...

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:41.231
...that he really blew it tonight
when he got out of the van?

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:49.506
<i>And that he knows Norah probably
never wants to see him again...</i>

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:52.476
<i>...and he'd like to apologize to her
in person.</i>

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:55.406
Really?

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:59.383
Yeah, where are you?
Did you leave the city?

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:02.989
<i>- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?</i>

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:04.448
Second and Ninth.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.686
<i>Okay, well, don't leave.
I'm gonna come over, okay?</i>

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.263
In the meantime,
could you pass that message on?

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.064
Hey.

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.910
I have a confession to make.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.739
Oh, you do?

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:01.375
I like your jacket.

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:05.815
- Oh, thanks. Well, it's not mine.
- It should be.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.149
It belongs to Salvatore.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.121
Well, he told me
that he wants you to keep it.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.316
He does?

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.962
- Yeah, he thinks it looks better on you.
- That's nice.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.257
But don't tell his wife,
because she gets crazy.

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.593
- And jealous.
- She's hostile?

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:23.397
- Is this your gum here?
- Don't touch it. I'm not done.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.267
It must maintain its freshness.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.774
So I also have a confession.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:38.148
- Before Tal, I never really...
- What?

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.958
- Kissed anyone else till tonight.
- Really?

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.753
Yeah.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.954
Unless you count Becca Weiner
at camp when I was 13.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.930
- I do count Becca Weiner.
- You do?

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:56.901
I don't know who wouldn't. You'd
have to be a fool not to count her.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:01.035
- How long were you guys together?
- Three campfire-y nights.

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:07.810
Oh, me and Tal? I knew that.
Three years total.

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.848
Friends with benefits?

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.784
I guess.

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.947
Well, what are the benefits?

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.990
Yeah, that's crossed my mind.
I don't know.

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:22.260
I don't know.
He's just always been there...

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:25.363
...and you just feel ignored
for long enough...

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:28.469
...and it's just nice
to feel special sometimes.

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.531
What is it that keeps two people
together for such a long time...

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.834
...when it's just not working?

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.136
I can call my parents and ask them.

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:43.943
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Yeah.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.015
Where do you wanna go?

01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:49.714
Anywhere. I mean,
it's only 4 in the morning.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.721
Where do you wanna go?

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:55.687
Somewhere nobody we know
will find us.

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.559
Yeah.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.694
I'll drive.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:10.136
Aren't you impressed
that I drive stick like a pro?

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:16.251
This is amazing. You are literally
like my musical soul mate.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:19.683
It's unbelievable.
Except for all the Cure.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.185
What's wrong with the Cure?

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.359
There's nothing wrong with the Cure,
actually, but just the name.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.961
You know, the Cure?
What are they the Curing?

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.133
Get it? They should be called
the Cause, right?

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.765
Maybe I'll take this for a bit
and you can focus on driving.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.531
What, you don't like
my sweet grooves?

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.435
I need something
to distract myself...

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:43.612
...from the fact that you're driving
my car pretty recklessly.

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.336
I am a great driver.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.571
Fine.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.618
Oh, this is a really fancy
parking job.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:59.191
It's good because if another car wants
to park between us and the curb...

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:00.657
...he can get right in here.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:04.663
Fine. I'll get closer to the curb,
just for you. Just for you, Nick.

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.164
Just because you're picky like that.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.096
Shit.

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:19.280
You're close enough to the curb now.
We're right on it.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.444
Sorry I broke your car.

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.483
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll call a tow truck or some...

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.249
And...

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.423
Welcome to...

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.990
Electric Lady Studios.
Built by Jimi Hendrix in 1970.

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:35.758
What? Do you have any idea
who recorded here?

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:39.059
Led Zeppelin? ACIDC?
The Rolling Stones?

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.132
David Bowie?

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.464
Your dad owns this place?

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:47.598
Is he this man?

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.034
Yeah.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:00.181
So, what is he, like a former hippie,
current yuppie...

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:03.119
...spoon-feeding the masses
the same old garbage?

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:04.986
Stop me at any time.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.416
Yes.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.096
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:12.027
I'm gonna use that in my graduation
speech. That's, like, amazing.

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.327
- Cool. Good.
- Here, come on.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:19.834
<i>They were supposed to show up
at Brooklyn Pool tonight...</i>

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.203
<i>...but it looks like Where's Fluffy
is gonna...</i>

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:26.006
<i>- Hold on. Listen.
- I don't think they deserve it.</i>

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.739
<i>- I should tell them?
- Yes.</i>

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.783
<i>- I shouldn't tell them?
- Yes, of course you should. Come on.</i>

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:35.013
<i>All right. We'll give you a hint.
Are you ready?</i>

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:41.595
<i>Five, 68, 100 and 21.</i>

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:42.991
Oh, come on.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.928
- The numbers. They mean something.
- It's a clue.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.002
- What did he say?
- So stupid.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.167
- Sixty-nine.
- No, 68. Get out of the gutter.

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:54.001
The alphabet. The A...

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:57.110
- There aren't 68 letters in the alphabet.
- I hate you sometimes.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.440
- Well, think, damn it.
- Five from 68, that's...

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.240
Retarded.
Gotta be something else.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.419
Song titles. Do we know
songs with numbers in the title?

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.951
It's a address.

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:11.022
Fifth Avenue, 68th Street,
New York, New York...

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:15.856
...10021.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:20.101
- It's an address. It's an address.
- Turn!

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.769
- No, I can't. Wait.
- Just do it!

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.130
Oh, my God!

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.465
I'm gonna throw up.

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.769
Well, don't throw up
on the Strat. Please.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.505
Yeah, I'll try not to.
Can I pick this up?

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.206
Yeah.

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:12.119
My God.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.286
It's left-handed.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.526
It's like playing for the first time.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.392
Is this the job that you have
lined up?

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.728
- It's mine if I want it, yeah.
- Well, how could you not want this?

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:31.372
I don't know. I love music,
you know what I mean?

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.072
But I feel like if I work in it
in here...

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.335
...I might not love it
the same way anymore.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:42.611
I loved your mixes, by the way.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:44.474
You heard those?

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:50.053
I heard one. Or seven.
Yeah, I have seven of them.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.996
I knew you liked Where's Fluffy
before I asked.

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.487
That's kind of creepy.

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:05.203
- What was your favorite song?
- Let's see. My favorite verse was:

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:09.366
"The way you're moving in your sleep,
the way you look before you leap...

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:13.742
...the strange illusions that you keep,
you don't know, but I'm noticing. "

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.413
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that?

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.484
I love that.

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.713
It wasn't about her.
It wasn't about anybody.

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.687
It was just, you know...

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.027
Would you play it?

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:29.322
- Right now?
- Yeah, dude. Look where we are.

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:32.091
- You wanna lay it down?
- Yes.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.132
- Really?
- Get in there.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.770
- Really?
- Go. Go for it.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:57.584
- Can you hear me?
- Check.

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.723
Yeah. All right.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:08.028
<i>I never should've let you drive my car
Because now it's ruined forever</i>

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.865
<i>It was the biggest mistake of my life
To let you drive it</i>

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:12.904
I'm sorry.

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.700
That's okay. I'm used to it.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:17.606
She falls apart
and I put her back together again.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.075
Just like me and Caroline.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:23.948
It reminds me of this part of Judaism
that I really like.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.518
<i>It's called Tikkun olam.</i>

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:29.816
It says that the world's been broken
into pieces...

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:34.519
...and it's everybody's job to find them
and put them back together again.

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:39.067
Well, maybe we're the pieces,
you know?

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:42.203
Maybe we're not supposed
to find the pieces.

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.269
Maybe we are the pieces.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.770
Nick?

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.434
Yeah?

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:55.106
I'm coming in.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.996
Hi.

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.580
I'm not gonna compete
with her, okay?

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.078
With who?

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:38.242
I think Dev has the same bra.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.718
I just...

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:47.584
I just, I know I'm not, like,
pretty like that.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.664
Norah, you're beautiful.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.101
Why is this button so difficult?

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:02.571
Sorry, Nicky.

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:04.837
- Why would you buy these pants?
- I don't know.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.174
I just, I don't know.
I can't remember.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.482
- Cold. Cold hands.
- Sorry.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.916
Why are your hands so cold?

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.324
You okay?

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:56.395
Yeah, it's just a little embarrassing.

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:00.735
Don't be embarrassed.
You're beautiful.

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:10.143
It's my phone. Sorry.

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:15.640
Nick?

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:16.977
What?

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:19.515
How do you feel about Where's Fluffy?

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.923
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.720
- Okay. Oh, hurry up.
- We have to hurry. Hurry, hurry.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.692
I am, I am, I am. Oh, my God.

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.190
Oh, shoes.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.368
Okay, hang on.

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.398
Okay. I'm ready. Okay, go.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:23.849
- Norah! You're here. I'm so happy.
- What are you doing here?

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.911
- How's it going?
- I'm never drinking again. I promise.

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.680
- Hey, Norah.
- Okay.

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:31.119
What are you doing?

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.755
You asshole.

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.793
Wait, you show up here
with this gaylord?

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.899
You trying to make a fool of me
in front of my boys?

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:43.400
<i>Do you realize that I had to walk back
to 10th by myself?</i>

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.835
- You weren't exactly by yourself.
- Shut up, Gary.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:49.135
- So you're telling me this is over?
- You're seriously over me?

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:52.713
Come on, no.

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:54.176
Come here a second.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:56.212
Come on.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:59.113
You're still gonna give your dad
our CD, right? Aren't you?

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:03.121
Come on, you know how hard we
worked on that. You promised me...

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.950
Wait. It's all good. It's all good.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.231
This doesn't concern you, Sal.

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:14.928
Well, anyway, so...

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.570
- It's Salvatore.
- Oh, yeah?

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.407
What, you blew it
with your own chick...

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.373
...so you gotta run around
playing beard with someone else's?

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:24.943
- Lf you push me again...
- What?

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:28.411
- Your merry men will bone me?
- That's it.

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.086
Leave her. She'll go running to Daddy.

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.727
Come on, come with me.
Just come with me.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.791
- Come on.
- Come on, come with me.

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:46.267
Let's go watch the show.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:19.292
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:49.829
That's three years I've wasted
on Ira Silverberg's daughter...

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.658
...and what does it get me?

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:54.391
Norah, who's gonna take me home?

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:56.832
Yeah, well, I hate your stupid band.

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.972
Oh, and P.S., I cheated on you.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.472
- Go away.
- Shut up.

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.232
Let's go.

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:08.144
<i>Don't leave yet, because we've got
one question for you: Are you ready...</i>

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:12.116
<i>...for Where's Fluffy?</i>

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.551
I love you, New York.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:28.892
Hey, what's wrong?

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.070
Are you sad we missed it?

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:34.598
We didn't miss it. This is it.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.445
Come on. Don't you wanna go home??

01:23:39.305 --> 01:23:45.686
