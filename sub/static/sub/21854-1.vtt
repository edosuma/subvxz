00:30.153 --> 00:32.020
Another one bites the dust.

00:32.122 --> 00:35.123
The New York City Snipper
is at it again this morning,

00:35.225 --> 00:37.125
snipping women's ponytails.

00:40.664 --> 00:42.564
- Oh, God!
- Ooh, oh, geez!

00:44.001 --> 00:46.001
- Shit.
- Hey, I got it. Hey.

00:46.103 --> 00:48.403
Oh, wow, thank you. That's so nice.

00:48.505 --> 00:50.238
No worries.

00:50.340 --> 00:54.342
That just happened to me.

00:54.444 --> 00:56.039
Oh, no, now you can't get through.

00:57.347 --> 00:59.114
Oh, you know, it's all
good. Go, go, go, go!

00:59.216 --> 01:00.115
Hey, come back! Stop!

01:00.217 --> 01:02.017
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

01:03.820 --> 01:06.755
- Jesus Christ!
- Ugh, you're kidding me!

01:11.094 --> 01:12.661
Thanks again for swiping me in.

01:12.763 --> 01:13.929
Oh, you're welcome, ma'am.

01:28.712 --> 01:30.445
Donald Trump will be president!

01:42.693 --> 01:44.926
Ew! Jesus Christ!

F Train suspended.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.705
Doesn't work anymore,
we gotta close it guys.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.637
Thank you.

01:55.739 --> 01:57.873
Well, thanks again for
swiping me in up there.

01:57.975 --> 01:59.241
Yeah, you got it.

Oh, God, I guess I'm
just not gonna go to work.

02:18.929 --> 02:20.695
Can't you just go in,
like, a little bit late?

02:20.797 --> 02:22.497
No, I forgot to lock up last night,

02:22.599 --> 02:23.899
so then I was supposed to
get there five minutes early

02:24.001 --> 02:25.333
this morning to fake lock up.

02:25.435 --> 02:28.203
And it didn't happen, so...
best thing to do right now

02:28.305 --> 02:30.472
is to smoke a lot of pot.

02:30.574 --> 02:32.807
I mean, I was just gonna
go to Bed, Bath and Beyond,

02:32.910 --> 02:35.610
but I could definitely do that high.

02:35.712 --> 02:36.978
That's cool.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.514
You know, I could smoke you up.

02:39.616 --> 02:41.603
Yeah, I... I thought
that's what you meant.

God, that's a strong kick.

03:10.781 --> 03:13.148
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. No, it's okay.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.284
Can I give you this money? This
is what we made today so far.

03:16.386 --> 03:18.486
Oh, don't... don't even worry about it.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.489
I'm just a silly,
upper-middle class NYU bitch,

03:21.592 --> 03:22.824
so I wouldn't take money from you.

Hey, I go to NYU too, Tisch
School Performing Arts.

03:25.118 --> 03:27.062
We all do.

03:27.164 --> 03:29.864
Tischies. Congrats.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.166
All right, I'll take 20.

03:35.372 --> 03:37.939
Whoops! Now you're all wet!

03:38.041 --> 03:40.008
Even though I know you were already.

03:41.378 --> 03:43.912
No, sir!

03:44.014 --> 03:47.248
'Cause I... I never get wet.

03:47.351 --> 03:50.318
And now, I got you all riled up!

03:53.390 --> 03:55.557
I love my life.

04:01.398 --> 04:03.331
Do you like Four Loko.
It kinda scares me.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.167
Whoops! Now you're all wet!

04:06.269 --> 04:08.303
Even though I know you were already.

04:09.506 --> 04:12.273
No! You know what?

04:12.376 --> 04:15.043
You're a needle-dick bitch, bitch.

04:15.145 --> 04:17.144
This guy's a bitch!

04:17.247 --> 04:19.514
You know hashtag, winning?
You're hashtag, losing.

04:19.616 --> 04:21.882
That's your symbol of
masculinity, a bubble gun?

04:21.985 --> 04:24.152
Good luck living the rest of your life.

04:24.254 --> 04:25.253
Yeah!

04:25.355 --> 04:27.789
Good luck living the rest of your life!

04:39.670 --> 04:42.604
I hate my life.

04:49.229 --> 04:50.786
_

04:50.821 --> 04:51.880
I knew it!

04:51.982 --> 04:53.648
I left the doors open
all night where I work

04:53.750 --> 04:55.150
and they fired me!

04:55.252 --> 04:57.185
Come on, dude, fuck Grey Dog,

04:57.287 --> 04:58.720
I hate that fucking place!

04:58.822 --> 05:00.021
Dude, I love Grey Dog!

05:00.123 --> 05:01.723
I mean, I'm sure the one
that you work at sucks.

05:01.825 --> 05:03.358
But the one on Carmine
is, like, amazing.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.927
- The staff is so sweet.
- Dude, that's where I work!

05:06.029 --> 05:09.531
- Dude, I'm in there, like, every day.
- Dude, how have we not seen each other?

05:09.633 --> 05:12.234
- Dude, this is insane!
- Oh, my God, dude!

05:12.336 --> 05:13.768
Okay, well listen,
if you need a new job,

05:13.871 --> 05:15.670
my friend Morgan just got
me this sick catering gig,

05:15.772 --> 05:17.506
and a spot just opened up
'cause some guy just OD'ed.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.507
Dude...

05:18.609 --> 05:20.342
Oh my God!

05:20.444 --> 05:23.128
- Oh shit, my notepad! My notepad!
- I got it, I got it!

05:24.281 --> 05:28.383
Oh my God, my hair! Oh, this is bad.

05:28.485 --> 05:31.820
No, it looks so good like
that. Why do you straighten it?

05:31.922 --> 05:34.289
'Cause I look like a true
Jew if I don't straighten.

05:34.391 --> 05:36.525
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.826
You wouldn't know.

05:37.928 --> 05:39.594
No, I'm Jewish.

05:39.696 --> 05:40.962
Not full.

05:41.064 --> 05:42.731
Yeah, I'm completely Jewish.

05:42.833 --> 05:45.867
- Check the records.
- Had a bat mitzvah.

05:47.571 --> 05:48.737
Did you get work done?

05:48.839 --> 05:51.006
- No!
- I can't believe it.

05:51.108 --> 05:53.542
Listen, I think you look like... You
got like a Rosie Perez vibe going.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.176
- If you poofed it up...
- What?

05:55.279 --> 05:58.980
Okay, now I'm doing it like this every
freaking day for the rest of my life, dude!

05:59.082 --> 06:00.315
Plus, it'll save me
two hours every morning,

06:00.417 --> 06:01.449
so I'll never be late for work again.

06:01.552 --> 06:03.652
Bonus Jonas!

06:03.754 --> 06:05.854
Would you wanna get breakfast?

06:05.956 --> 06:07.188
- I'm starving.
- Oh, my God.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.691
I thought you'd never
ask. Yes, I'm starving too.

06:09.793 --> 06:11.526
Jinx tummies.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.099
Come on.

06:18.201 --> 06:20.635
Sorry, hopefully they'll be out soon.

06:20.737 --> 06:22.404
Thanks.

06:31.848 --> 06:33.281
Ha-ha!

06:33.383 --> 06:34.950
- No!
- It's the Snipper!

06:35.052 --> 06:36.384
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

06:36.486 --> 06:38.553
He took my pony!

06:38.655 --> 06:39.621
Ew...

06:43.727 --> 06:46.494
No, really, he
just grabbed her ponytail.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.771
Oh... hey, Tim.

06:56.873 --> 06:58.299
Ilana, are you kidding me?

06:59.276 --> 07:01.409
Is that the Kenyan hazelnut?

07:01.511 --> 07:03.345
You're fired.

07:03.447 --> 07:05.113
Are you serious?

07:05.215 --> 07:08.083
Yes, you are so completely fired.

07:08.185 --> 07:09.584
Fine.

07:09.686 --> 07:13.488
God... but I'm at least entitled to
my one free coffee a day for employees.

07:13.590 --> 07:14.756
You made that up.

07:14.858 --> 07:16.324
There is no one free
coffee a day for employees.

07:16.426 --> 07:17.592
You're just a thief.

07:17.694 --> 07:19.527
Wow, did you just call me a queef?

07:19.630 --> 07:20.996
That's sexual harrass...

07:21.098 --> 07:22.263
Get out, go.

07:22.366 --> 07:23.632
Fine.

07:25.002 --> 07:26.968
Yeah, I'm so excited.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.937
First week in New
York, I love this city.

07:42.286 --> 07:44.352
Hey, Mel?

07:44.455 --> 07:46.254
Melody, are you home?

07:46.356 --> 07:49.224
Is this the famous Abbi Abrams?

07:49.326 --> 07:51.827
Fierce 'do!

07:51.929 --> 07:54.696
You must be Matt.

07:54.798 --> 07:57.933
All my friends call me Bevers.

07:58.035 --> 08:00.669
It's nice to meet you, Bevers.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.737
Nice to meet you, Abbi.

08:05.423 --> 08:06.955
Ever since Melody got
a job at the law firm,

08:07.058 --> 08:08.390
it's like I never see her.

08:08.492 --> 08:10.426
I almost forgot what it's
like to have a roommate.

08:10.528 --> 08:11.960
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

08:12.063 --> 08:13.295
It's not like I'm moving in or anything.

08:13.397 --> 08:14.430
Right.

08:14.532 --> 08:15.964
I've been looking for places all week.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.368
I gotta find something
by the weekend, fo' sho.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.703
You know, in the meantime,
make yourself at home.

08:21.806 --> 08:23.172
And I just went food shopping.

08:23.274 --> 08:24.540
I'm gonna make you a snack plate.

08:24.642 --> 08:25.741
Uh, are you sure?

08:25.843 --> 08:27.676
I mean, I don't wanna be an imposition

08:27.778 --> 08:29.078
around here or anything.

08:29.180 --> 08:30.312
No, it's fine.

08:30.414 --> 08:32.748
I mean, I can't eat a whole
wedge of cheese on my own.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.482
Okay. Can I give you money?

08:35.885 --> 08:38.153
No. Come on.

08:38.255 --> 08:42.191
Okay... I mean, if you ever want me
to do chores around here or anything...

08:42.293 --> 08:45.294
Listen, I'm the host, you're the guest.

08:45.396 --> 08:47.247
I wanna make my host feel comfortable,

08:47.282 --> 08:51.200
so as a guest, the rules of the
house are I never pay for food,

08:51.302 --> 08:53.669
I never do chores, is that correct?

08:53.771 --> 08:55.204
No, that'd be weird.

08:55.306 --> 08:58.240
Okay. Got it.

09:01.078 --> 09:02.411
Hey, Madisons.

09:02.513 --> 09:04.346
Hey.

09:04.448 --> 09:07.883
Eww, I am having, like,
a salty, wet diarrhea

09:07.985 --> 09:10.886
of a fucking day!

09:10.988 --> 09:12.554
What's going on with you guys?

09:12.656 --> 09:14.890
We're actually having
our weekly suite meeting.

09:14.992 --> 09:17.960
Why would you have a
suite-ing without me?

09:18.062 --> 09:20.062
Okay, um...

09:20.164 --> 09:23.398
we should just go on with
it, even though she's here.

09:23.501 --> 09:26.668
Elizabeth Buton-Bates, will you
please resume the PowerPoint?

09:29.627 --> 09:31.944
_

09:36.280 --> 09:38.580
Madison, what the fuck is this?

09:38.682 --> 09:41.917
Number 27... you call all of us Madison.

09:42.019 --> 09:44.186
What are you talking about, Madis...

09:46.157 --> 09:48.090
Right, that is rude.

09:48.192 --> 09:49.458
I acknowledge that is rude.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.360
Parker Luxton?

09:54.165 --> 09:55.097
The wall.

09:55.199 --> 09:56.231
What wall?

09:58.202 --> 10:01.637
The wall of graphic
pornography above your bed.

10:01.739 --> 10:03.038
Oh, come on!

10:03.140 --> 10:06.608
I contribute a lot of
culture to this suite.

10:06.710 --> 10:09.811
You're always making us watch videos
of animals having sex with people.

10:09.914 --> 10:12.814
Oh, my God, again! I
showed you one video.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.168
- Many times.
- Of a man fighting

10:15.203 --> 10:18.220
for the sensual pleasure of his life,

10:18.322 --> 10:21.156
only to die later
from internal bleeding.

10:21.258 --> 10:22.357
It's Mr. Hands!

10:22.459 --> 10:24.693
It's literally bestiality,

10:24.795 --> 10:28.664
and it is literally a crime to watch.

10:28.766 --> 10:32.167
I see... because if it
were a lady horse and a man,

10:32.269 --> 10:33.335
no one would have a problem with it.

10:33.437 --> 10:35.804
They can get fucking
married for all I care.

10:35.906 --> 10:38.006
But gay dudes can't get married?

10:38.108 --> 10:40.609
Gay dudes can't get
married, so a horse-dude

10:40.711 --> 10:43.612
and a dude-dude can not fuck.

10:44.915 --> 10:47.049
Jessica Merkel-Keller.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.853
Jesus!

10:51.956 --> 10:54.489
We know this one is just mean.

10:54.592 --> 10:57.326
But when your hair is
curly, it looks like pubes.

10:57.428 --> 10:58.560
You're a fucking bitch,

10:58.662 --> 11:01.363
but I'll go over it with the iron again.

11:01.465 --> 11:03.065
Good job.

11:04.235 --> 11:05.701
- That's what a throuple is.
- Wow.

11:05.803 --> 11:08.070
Again, I love your hair curly.

11:08.172 --> 11:09.771
- Thank you so much!
- Yeah.

11:09.873 --> 11:11.907
Okay, okay, if you had to be a throuple

11:12.009 --> 11:14.109
with any current couple,
who would you pick?

11:14.211 --> 11:16.211
Michelle and Barack Obama, hands down.

11:16.313 --> 11:17.846
Yes, they are so hot as a couple

11:17.948 --> 11:19.581
and as the leaders of the free world.

11:19.683 --> 11:20.949
I mean, I am so relieved

11:21.051 --> 11:23.051
that we have a hot
black guy as president.

11:23.153 --> 11:25.220
I mean, I feel like we're
finally moving forward.

11:25.322 --> 11:26.555
And it's just the beginning.

11:26.657 --> 11:28.890
I mean, never backwards. Only forwards!

11:28.993 --> 11:29.858
Next is a woman.

11:29.960 --> 11:30.892
Whoo!

11:32.096 --> 11:34.062
And so, finally, that brings us to...

11:34.164 --> 11:37.065
the three principles
of natural selection.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.302
These are in your textbook,
but I just outlined them here.

11:40.404 --> 11:41.937
Hey...

11:44.842 --> 11:46.908
Mm, hi.

11:47.011 --> 11:48.610
Aye, no, did you get kicked in the face

11:48.712 --> 11:50.623
- by a subway performer again?
- Oh, ow. Yeah.

11:50.658 --> 11:54.483
And now, we are going to open the
floor to some of our presentations.

11:54.585 --> 11:55.617
Did you bring your presentation?

11:55.719 --> 11:56.918
- And first, we'll have...
- What presentation?

11:57.021 --> 11:58.247
Ilana Wexler?

11:59.590 --> 12:01.490
Jaime, can you pull
the fire alarm again?

12:01.592 --> 12:04.760
I really want to, but I'm trying to
become a citizen one day. It's illegal.

12:04.862 --> 12:07.429
- I understand.
- Ilana Wexler.

12:07.531 --> 12:09.531
Yes, Professor!

12:09.633 --> 12:12.567
I am present and attending.

12:12.670 --> 12:14.269
What class is this?

12:14.371 --> 12:16.938
Professor...

12:17.041 --> 12:18.674
Is this French?

12:18.776 --> 12:21.610
Glasses on, phones off, please!

12:21.712 --> 12:23.712
Fake an emergency in 30 seconds.

12:31.388 --> 12:34.756
Welcome to my lecture.

12:34.858 --> 12:39.695
The day is Thursday,
the time is one o'clock.

12:39.797 --> 12:40.729
Gotta stop you there.

12:40.831 --> 12:42.597
It's Friday and it's 4:00 p.m.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.866
But please, continue.

12:44.968 --> 12:48.236
I stand corrected.

12:48.339 --> 12:51.740
We shall commence our lecture...

12:51.842 --> 12:54.242
presentation...

12:54.345 --> 12:57.779
right now.

12:57.881 --> 13:00.849
♪ White humans ♪

13:00.951 --> 13:03.151
♪ Evil to the bone ♪

13:03.253 --> 13:06.955
Uh, Miss Wexler, we've gone over this.

13:07.057 --> 13:08.490
This is not Tisch.

13:08.592 --> 13:11.293
Yeah, you made that very clear
the day you took my djembe away.

13:11.395 --> 13:13.762
You'll get that back at
the end of the semester.

13:15.232 --> 13:17.299
There's a sinkhole in my hometown.

13:17.401 --> 13:19.167
My house is gone!

13:19.269 --> 13:20.669
Yes, girl, thank you.

13:20.771 --> 13:22.070
I'm serious, you bitch!

13:24.074 --> 13:28.443
Well, let's move
on to the next presentation.

13:28.545 --> 13:30.879
Ilana, you can actually go, if you like.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.647
Really, I'd love to workshop...

13:32.750 --> 13:33.915
It's for the best.

13:34.017 --> 13:35.550
Mm.

13:42.359 --> 13:44.292
Have you ever
been to a psychic before?

13:44.395 --> 13:46.328
No, but I've always wanted to.

13:46.430 --> 13:48.196
It's ten bucks, do you wanna do it?

13:48.298 --> 13:49.998
- Yes!
- Okay.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.033
This is the best day.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.242
Welcome.

14:00.344 --> 14:01.576
- Hi.
- I'm Oda.

14:01.678 --> 14:03.478
I possess the gift.

14:03.580 --> 14:06.448
Um, hi, we're interested in...

14:06.550 --> 14:08.750
Oh, I know.

14:08.852 --> 14:10.485
I possess the gift.

14:10.587 --> 14:12.020
Oh. She's good.

14:12.122 --> 14:16.324
I'm feeling... you girls...

14:16.427 --> 14:18.160
are new friends.

14:18.262 --> 14:19.394
- We are!
- Oh my God!

14:22.299 --> 14:24.933
Oh, I'm sorry. Indigestion.

14:25.035 --> 14:27.402
So, as I was say...

14:29.106 --> 14:30.972
Prophecy.

14:32.876 --> 14:34.910
You're gonna die today.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.560
We are so not dying today!

14:40.662 --> 14:42.896
So not! I mean, what, are
we gonna listen to her?

14:42.998 --> 14:45.999
She was eating a burrito bowl.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.568
You know, it's like...
it could inspire us

14:48.670 --> 14:51.104
to live like we're gonna die tomorrow.

14:51.206 --> 14:53.607
Like, imagine if we did something crazy.

14:53.709 --> 14:54.941
- I don't know.
- Yeah, okay.

14:55.043 --> 14:58.245
Like, what if we got a tattoo?

14:58.347 --> 15:00.480
I mean, that's like
really big and permanent.

15:00.582 --> 15:01.648
It's cool.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.450
I have always wanted to get one.

15:03.552 --> 15:04.851
But I don't know, then
you can't be buried

15:04.953 --> 15:06.386
in the cemetery and that whole thing.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.988
Yeah, but that's just for Jewish people.

15:08.090 --> 15:10.090
Yeah, I'm Jewish, remember? I told you.

15:10.192 --> 15:12.359
I thought you were joking.

15:12.461 --> 15:13.827
No, I'm not kidding.

15:21.937 --> 15:23.470
Oh!

15:23.572 --> 15:26.640
Did you... pff... did you see that?

15:26.742 --> 15:28.275
The guy with the bike!

15:28.377 --> 15:29.376
Help!

15:31.446 --> 15:33.046
Oh, hey! Hey!

15:33.148 --> 15:34.714
- Give me the vest!
- Hey!

15:34.816 --> 15:37.918
Can you help me? Help me!

15:40.322 --> 15:42.689
I mean, I have always wanted a tattoo.

15:42.791 --> 15:45.725
But I can't think of anything
that I care that much about.

15:45.827 --> 15:47.460
Hm.

15:47.563 --> 15:49.729
Except...

15:50.832 --> 15:53.033
Oh, shit!

15:53.135 --> 15:54.234
Okay. Ooh!

15:54.336 --> 15:55.368
Whoo!

15:55.470 --> 15:56.703
I can't believe she's
ending her show though.

15:56.805 --> 15:58.605
I mean, like, what are we all gonna do?

15:58.707 --> 15:59.940
Probably watch the
Oprah Winfrey Network.

16:00.042 --> 16:00.941
Oh, God.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.309
Okay.

16:02.411 --> 16:03.810
Wow, you're doing good.

16:03.912 --> 16:04.945
Okay.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.664
Ooh, have you ever
been to this pizza place

16:24.766 --> 16:26.666
on Orchard and Delancey?
It's my favorite.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.068
Plus, sometimes, they
give me free pizza.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.836
I don't know that
spot, but I always smoke

16:29.938 --> 16:31.137
on the median of that intersection,

16:31.239 --> 16:32.372
because when a cop sees me,

16:32.474 --> 16:33.640
I just throw my bowl into traffic.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.542
You throw a glass bowl into traffic?

16:35.644 --> 16:37.043
Oh, yeah. Done and done.

16:37.145 --> 16:38.878
What?

16:42.284 --> 16:44.551
So, my roommate's boyfriend
is staying with us.

16:44.653 --> 16:46.720
- How long?
- She didn't say.

16:46.822 --> 16:48.688
Oof... no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.024
Not liking this. This don't look good.

16:51.126 --> 16:52.726
This don't smell good, baby.

16:52.828 --> 16:56.363
He sounds like a freeloading
bag-of-trash bitch.

16:56.465 --> 16:57.831
I mean, I barely said
anything about him.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.065
I haven't even met him yet.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.433
No, you gotta call your roommate

17:00.535 --> 17:02.769
right the fucking now
and nip this in the ass

17:02.871 --> 17:04.704
before he pulls squatters rights on you.

17:05.906 --> 17:07.741
Yeah, okay.

17:09.211 --> 17:10.577
"Nip it in the ass," is that the saying?

17:10.679 --> 17:13.613
Yeah, nip it in the ass.

17:13.714 --> 17:16.483
Okay.

17:16.585 --> 17:18.218
Hey, Melody, it's me.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.887
Um... I just wanted to
call real quick and tell you

17:20.989 --> 17:23.089
that I'm really not
comfortable with Matt

17:23.191 --> 17:25.959
staying any longer than this week.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.492
And she should break up with him.

17:29.131 --> 17:33.166
Um... for real, like, it
just doesn't feel right,

17:33.268 --> 17:35.335
and it's not what I signed up for.

17:41.877 --> 17:44.044
Okay, oh my God, that...

17:44.146 --> 17:45.645
that'd be perfect, that's amazing.

17:45.747 --> 17:48.615
Thank you so much for
being... so open-minded

17:48.717 --> 17:50.083
and for listening to me and hearing me.

17:50.185 --> 17:51.851
I really thought that
this would be harder,

17:51.953 --> 17:54.621
and this is amazing,
we're really communicating.

17:54.723 --> 17:57.891
Okay, yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.292
- Dude!
- Oh, my God!

17:59.394 --> 18:01.428
- That was so good, girl!
- That was amazing!

18:01.530 --> 18:02.495
- Yes!
- Good job, dude.

18:02.597 --> 18:04.297
You killed that!

18:04.399 --> 18:08.168
Thank you so much. I
never would have done that.

18:08.270 --> 18:09.803
You were great.

18:15.644 --> 18:17.911
I had, like, the funnest day.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.112
I know, me too!

18:19.214 --> 18:20.847
- It was the best.
- It was.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.219
Would you ever wanna hang out again?

18:26.321 --> 18:28.188
Like, tomorrow?

18:28.290 --> 18:30.290
I would love that!

18:30.392 --> 18:31.391
Yeah?

18:31.493 --> 18:33.593
My new friend.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.399
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:39.501 --> 18:41.401
Go, go, go!

18:41.503 --> 18:43.303
- The pizza!
- Leave it!

18:43.405 --> 18:45.605
♪♪

19:05.012 --> 19:06.611
Hey!

19:06.713 --> 19:09.347
You're the girl that
swiped me in this morning.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.549
That is so weird.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.118
Yeah, that's nuts.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.753
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.254
How was your day?

19:16.356 --> 19:20.225
Uh... well, I... I just
bought three slices of pizza

19:20.327 --> 19:24.229
that I'm gonna eat myself,
so... pretty much sums it up.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.231
- Gotcha, okay.
- Yeah. How was your day?

19:26.333 --> 19:29.801
You know, terrible. Terrible day.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.570
I'm sorry.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.172
Do you want a hit?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.909
Yeah. That'd be awesome.

19:40.147 --> 19:42.781
Thanks. Cool pipe.

19:42.883 --> 19:44.182
Got it on McDougal.

19:48.088 --> 19:49.421
Do you want some pizza?

19:49.523 --> 19:51.056
Oh, my God, I would love some.

19:51.158 --> 19:53.458
Okay, well, I have to run
back over to the pizza shop,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.060
'cause I bought these three for me.

19:55.162 --> 19:57.462
Respect.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.997
Yeah, uh, yeah.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.265
That's amazing.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.733
I need it today.

20:01.835 --> 20:03.435
I know exactly what you mean.

20:05.005 --> 20:07.539
Whoa, look. Wet cement.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.307
You never see that.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.210
Oh, my God.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.813
We should press our breasts into it.

20:14.915 --> 20:18.049
That feels...

20:18.151 --> 20:20.318
I mean, we could just
write our names, right?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.687
Classy. Yeah.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.125
- Whoa.
- Okay.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.364
- This is amazing.
- This is nuts.

20:37.838 --> 20:39.003
Abbi with "I".

20:39.106 --> 20:40.338
Ilana with an "I".

20:41.808 --> 20:42.974
It's really nice to meet you.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.776
Yeah, you too.

20:44.878 --> 20:49.180
Um... you wanna take a walk?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.816
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Cool.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.554
So, what's with the black eye?

20:56.656 --> 21:00.425
You know, I'm a supporter of the arts.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.826
I'm an artist!

21:01.928 --> 21:03.962
- That's dope.
- Like, yeah, that's what I do.

21:04.064 --> 21:05.497
You know, you look like an artist,

21:05.599 --> 21:07.132
because of your haircut.
Did you get it cut today?

21:07.234 --> 21:08.767
- It's dope!
- No...

21:08.869 --> 21:11.336
I mean, in a... In a way, I did.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.404
- I love it.
- Yeah.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.474
You know what I've been
thinking about lately?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.276
- What?
- This is so, like, stupid,

21:18.378 --> 21:21.713
but why can't you get
eggs after 11:00 a.m.?

21:21.815 --> 21:23.181
I think about that all the time!

21:23.283 --> 21:24.986
Are you serious?
