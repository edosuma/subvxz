WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.794
- Previously
on Being Human...

00:02.830 --> 00:04.264
- No unauthorized ghosts
in the nursery.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.995
- You're not dead
and you're talking to me?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.098
There's something
after me,

00:07.140 --> 00:09.962
something dark that
I let loose into my world.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.000
Aaah!

00:11.040 --> 00:12.337
Get off!
Get me out!

00:12.380 --> 00:13.506
- This is what happens

00:13.540 --> 00:15.008
when you take.
You lose control.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.439
(Growling)

00:16.480 --> 00:17.447
- Nora!

00:17.480 --> 00:18.675
You're a killer.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.247
I want to work on
finding a cure.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.386
I need to fix this, I need
to try and fix this for you!

00:24.420 --> 00:27.390
- We've gathered here to confirm
the best vampire to lead Boston.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.627
That person is my daughter.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.028
- I will work for you,
but I could never be like you.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.119
I haven't eaten.
The hospital put the supply

00:35.160 --> 00:36.628
under lock and key.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.038
I'm gonna get sick and
then the hunger takes over.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.459
- Still nice to have something
to fall back to, huh?

00:46.740 --> 00:48.777
(Elevator bell dinging)

00:55.780 --> 00:58.613
- (Josh):
Most people can't do it,

00:58.650 --> 01:00.118
cover up their true feelings

01:00.160 --> 01:02.219
pretend to be something
they're not.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.328
(Knocking)

01:10.770 --> 01:13.592
- Oh, I can't, baby.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.836
I got nothing left.

01:15.870 --> 01:20.376
- Um, I'll pay you double.
Just one more time.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.730
- Then I'll be dead.

01:21.780 --> 01:26.217
I'll tell you what.
You come back later.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.742
I'll talk to Darla.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.748
Maybe she can
take care of you.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.179
- Fine.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.517
Anyone asks---

01:34.560 --> 01:36.722
- I know, you were never here.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.683
- But it doesn't
change who you are

01:38.730 --> 01:40.494
or what you are.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.520
- No nightmares?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.698
- None.

01:42.730 --> 01:46.394
- Nothing big, scary or
disembodied coming after you?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.363
- Nope, not for
a couple weeks.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.368
- Congratulations.
It's a start.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.175
- Does this not fast-track
me to reincarnation?

01:53.210 --> 01:54.006
(Baby crying)

01:54.040 --> 01:56.247
I'm sure one of
these sick guys

01:56.280 --> 01:57.805
could use my help.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.217
I'm ready.
Pull me in, coach.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.843
- We still don't
know what you saw

02:01.880 --> 02:03.814
or if it's
gone for good.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.581
I run this
group for ghosts,

02:06.620 --> 02:08.554
meet once a week.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.422
- Why do I need
other ghosts?

02:10.460 --> 02:13.395
I have you and you know
all about them.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.649
- You realize you are
one of them.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.759
- Well, I'm kind of
a special case.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.619
After all, I did--

02:18.670 --> 02:21.469
- "Turn down my door
to help a friend."

02:21.500 --> 02:23.264
We know. Too bad
you're already dead

02:23.310 --> 02:24.436
or we'd put it
on your tombstone.

02:24.470 --> 02:27.804
- I just don't wanna take
a spot in your group

02:27.840 --> 02:29.205
for somebody who
actually needs it.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.105
- Like a ghost who thinks

02:31.150 --> 02:33.141
she summoned pure evil
into the world?

02:34.450 --> 02:38.239
- If you hate what you are,
you'll do anything to deny it.

02:38.290 --> 02:41.681
You'll feed the line
till it becomes real.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.721
(Crying)

02:42.760 --> 02:45.479
But who you are
doesn't go away.

02:45.530 --> 02:46.600
It waits for you.

02:46.630 --> 02:47.722
- Hey, there.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.229
I was hoping
I'd see you here.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.692
- Hello, Dr. Forest!

02:51.730 --> 02:54.734
- So, um, any change
on the Lothian girl

02:54.770 --> 02:55.737
- Nope.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.499
- Pulse,
"ox" levels steady?

02:57.540 --> 02:58.701
- Correct.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.378
- Huh! Whatever
you're doing,

03:00.410 --> 03:01.571
it's working wonders.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.169
(Giggling)

03:03.210 --> 03:04.473
- He's cute!

03:04.510 --> 03:06.046
Zoe?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.843
- OK.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.689
Nice chat.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.685
Were you playing
hard to get

03:14.720 --> 03:17.621
or were you auditioning
for the Miracle Worker?

03:17.660 --> 03:20.425
How much time do
you spend around humans?

03:20.460 --> 03:21.689
- All day.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.698
- That don't
spit up on you?

03:25.700 --> 03:28.340
Don't you think
it's time to try?

03:28.370 --> 03:29.667
- Never saw
a reason to.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.905
- I did.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.908
And you just
let him walk away.

03:34.510 --> 03:37.445
- We put so much work into
hiding what's really there,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.539
a new coat of paint
on rotted wood,

03:39.580 --> 03:43.687
creative accounting,
the comb-over.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.119
But then you realize

03:45.150 --> 03:47.619
that lie you've spent
so much time crafting...

03:47.660 --> 03:49.458
- Excuse me.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.155
I need your help.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.295
The police brought
my brother here.

03:54.330 --> 03:55.923
They won't even
let me see him.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.268
- Do you know
where he is?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.927
- The psych ward.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.836
I need you to
help me get him out.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.099
- Oh, I can't do that.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.063
- You work here, right?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.305
- The scrubs, right.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.535
They--they confuse
a lot of people.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.105
I'm not a doctor.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.302
I'm not a nurse.
I'm just an orderly.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.512
- I'm not asking
because you're a doctor.

04:12.550 --> 04:16.077
- ...in the end, the only person
your lie ever fools...

04:16.120 --> 04:17.588
- I'm asking
because you're a wolf.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.884
- ...IS you.

04:31.930 --> 04:33.398
How did you
know I'm a wolf?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.169
Am I giving
something off?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.929
(Sniffing)

04:36.970 --> 04:38.131
- I'm a wolf too.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.271
I've always been able
to tell and so can Connor.

04:43.310 --> 04:44.175
- Your brother?

04:44.210 --> 04:46.076
- Yeah, and
he's not crazy.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.339
He just got
into a fight.

04:47.380 --> 04:48.848
He almost never does
this kind of thing.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.190
- Almost never isn't
exactly helping his case.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.258
- I know! OK, look, some
guys were picking on him.

04:54.290 --> 04:55.086
He wouldn't stop.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.157
He wouldn't back down.
He lost it.

04:57.190 --> 05:00.228
And when the cops came,
he couldn't pull it together,

05:00.260 --> 05:01.398
so they brought
him here.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.228
- I'm sure he's
a nice fellow, OK?

05:03.270 --> 05:06.365
But maybe this is exactly where
he needs to be right now.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.562
- No, no, no. We can't
leave him here.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.409
What if they start
running tests on him

05:10.440 --> 05:13.933
and he comes
back different?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.074
They're gonna treat him
like some lab animal.

05:16.110 --> 05:17.908
(Door beeping)

05:20.420 --> 05:23.390
(Telephone ringing
in distance)

05:25.220 --> 05:27.279
How long can they
hold him here?

05:29.360 --> 05:32.227
- Involuntary hold
is a week.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.900
- That puts us into
a full moon.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.493
- Then your brother's not
the one I'm worried about.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.429
(People talking, indistinct)

05:49.610 --> 05:51.203
OK, listen to me.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.413
There's a service
entrance around back.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.111
Meet us there in
10 minutes, OK?

05:56.150 --> 05:57.185
- OK.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.079
(Beep, click)

06:08.100 --> 06:10.592
- Why can't we eat in
my office? There are no bugs.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.064
- And no people.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.363
- Why you so happy?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.929
I hate you
a lot right now.

06:18.970 --> 06:22.008
- Just follow my lead.
You'll do great.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.405
(Women talking, indistinct)

06:23.450 --> 06:25.077
- I never see
you out here.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.112
- Because 1
don't like it.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.174
- Oh.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.387
You hungry?

06:30.420 --> 06:32.184
Can't beat vending-
machine tuna.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.086
- Allergic.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.155
- But thank you.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.085
But thank you.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.200
- But thank you!

06:40.230 --> 06:42.050
- No problem.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.092
So I hear you
grew up in Sudbury.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.360
My mom taught
high school there.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.663
- Oh.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.260
- Tell him that's interesting.
- It's not.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.505
- What's not?

06:52.540 --> 06:55.237
- Nothing. Uh, I mean,
what you were saying,

06:55.280 --> 06:57.772
it wasn't interesting.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.175
- Noted.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.271
So Sudbury, my mother
and tuna are now off limits.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.186
Oh, and the outdoors.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.281
- Come on! Just give the guy
a hair flip and chuckle.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.626
(Giggling)

07:12.660 --> 07:13.525
Hair flip!

07:13.560 --> 07:16.962
Come on, this is
5th-grade stuff, Gonzalez!

07:20.400 --> 07:21.629
- Anyway, I should, um...

07:21.670 --> 07:23.638
(Giggling)

07:23.670 --> 07:25.229
I should get back.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.431
- Can't argue with that.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.073
- Can't argue
with that.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.983
- OK, OK. Let's say we have
some room for improvement.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.149
When was your
last date?

07:48.830 --> 07:50.093
(Honking)

07:51.570 --> 07:53.561
(Siren)

07:58.240 --> 07:59.799
- Hey, do you guys
notice anything

07:59.840 --> 08:02.878
extra wolfy
about me today?

08:04.750 --> 08:06.343
- No.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.041
You look normal.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.617
Pale Rider over here
doesn't look so hot though.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.243
- Had a rough night.
That's all.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.486
Why are you so worried
about the wolf thing?

08:14.520 --> 08:15.681
(Grunting)

08:15.720 --> 08:19.554
- Well, because another werewolf
walked right up to me today

08:19.600 --> 08:20.749
and called me out.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.790
- What you do?

08:21.830 --> 08:22.820
(Sighing)

08:22.870 --> 08:25.191
- I helped her
werewolf brother

08:25.230 --> 08:26.789
break out of
the psych ward.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.490
(Toilet flushing)

08:28.540 --> 08:31.760
I know it wasn't a perfect
plan, but I--I just--

08:31.810 --> 08:34.131
I felt bad for the guy.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.807
I mean, he seemed harmless.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.102
- Like Danny.
- Like Ray.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.777
- I didn't know
what else to do.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.676
OK? It was either
let the guy go

08:40.720 --> 08:43.087
or turn the psych ward
into Thunderdome.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.918
- I'm sure it's fine.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.620
What do you guys know
about Dr. Forest?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.082
Tim?

08:51.130 --> 08:53.394
You guys hang out?

08:53.430 --> 08:55.489
- He's a doctor.
I'm an orderly.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.465
- He's new. I don't really
know that much about him.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.559
- New? Perfect!

09:00.600 --> 09:02.398
He'll be like training
wheels for Zoe.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.637
- I did see him have lunch
with a woman last week.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.105
- Lunch? Whatever.

09:08.140 --> 09:09.505
Serious couples
eat at night.

09:09.540 --> 09:12.271
- Weird Zoe and
the hot doc?

09:12.310 --> 09:15.848
No, that's like
Jack Bauer dating Chloe.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.110
It's like you kind of want
to see it but not really.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.187
- You just let a werewolf
out of the nut-wing,

09:20.220 --> 09:22.109
so guess who
doesn't get a vote!

09:23.490 --> 09:24.719
Who's home tonight?

09:24.760 --> 09:26.182
- I am.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.096
Nora's working
doubles all week.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.359
- Don't wait up.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.062
I got some things
to do first.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.762
- You know how creepy
that sounds, right?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.336
- I hope she's worth it.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.508
(Clearing throat)

09:44.350 --> 09:46.170
(Sighing)

09:49.250 --> 09:51.548
(Trolley bell dinging)

09:51.590 --> 09:53.479
(Splashing)

09:53.520 --> 09:54.851
(Gasps)

09:54.890 --> 09:57.484
- Oh! Who do you
think you are?

09:57.530 --> 10:00.556
- The unluckiest vampire
in Boston again.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.557
- If you truly were
a great warrior,

10:02.600 --> 10:05.763
and not just some
hollow reputation,

10:05.800 --> 10:08.792
off doing something useful
instead of harassing me.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.535
- Sister, if you give me a
lecture on squandered talent,

10:10.570 --> 10:11.662
let me pull up a chair.

10:11.710 --> 10:12.939
You're the expert.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.870
- You think my guards
in Newport or Chicago

10:15.910 --> 10:17.275
would ever lay
a finger on me?

10:17.310 --> 10:19.074
- Of course not, they all want
something from you.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.248
I just want you gone.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.147
- At least there, people
understand how to treat us.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.010
- You want to be treated
like a royal, act like one,

10:25.050 --> 10:26.609
and stop using
your mother

10:26.660 --> 10:28.150
as an excuse to do nothing!
- Ugh!

10:28.190 --> 10:30.158
(Car honking)

10:33.230 --> 10:36.791
You're late, but at
least you look like crap.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.992
Tell me, when is this
nonsense of you not feeding

10:39.030 --> 10:39.997
going to stop?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.462
- I'm here, aren't I?

10:41.500 --> 10:44.003
- Barely. How am I
supposed to run Boston

10:44.040 --> 10:45.804
when this is what
I have to work with?

10:45.840 --> 10:47.205
- Who is this?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.709
- Someone I want you
to meet.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.605
- So, he's one too?

10:51.650 --> 10:53.448
- One what?
- A vampire.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.415
Relax.
He knows about us.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.215
- A girl that worked
for me, a dancer,

10:59.250 --> 11:03.483
she got a very generous offer,
but not for sex, for blood.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.884
So, I started
asking around,

11:04.930 --> 11:07.490
connected a few dots,
and here I am.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.227
But I'm not here to
break up anyone's party.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.522
- What do you want?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.299
- I wanna become
one of you.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.160
(Laughing)

11:16.200 --> 11:18.202
- Uh, not interested.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.106
- We haven't even
heard his offer.

11:20.140 --> 11:23.041
- I can get you access, hmm?
Politicians, judges.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.471
You need girls or boys for your
blood-den places, they're yours.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.444
Something goes wrong, well,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.642
we handle the waste-
management side of things too.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.613
- In exchange,
we grant you the strength

11:32.650 --> 11:34.960
to wipe out anyone
who stands in your way.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.652
You sky-rocket through
the mob ranks, we get little,

11:37.690 --> 11:38.953
you get immortality.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.958
Nah-uh. No, we don't
need his help.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.423
- Until I get it from
my own people, I do.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.360
- I've heard about your
orphan problem too, hmm?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.266
The vamps
you cut loose,

11:48.300 --> 11:51.634
they're, uh, they're
getting desperate, sloppy.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.980
Yesterday, one of
them grabbed a couple girls

11:54.010 --> 11:55.000
at a soccer practice.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.474
That keeps
happening, well,

11:56.510 --> 11:57.705
that comes back to you.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.445
- We can handle
the orphans.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.470
(Chuckling)

12:00.520 --> 12:02.249
- Look, all I wanna
do is help, hmm?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.544
They're living
outside the law.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.684
The people they
talk to talk to me.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.458
- And you can tell us
where they are.

12:10.490 --> 12:14.620
- Well, uh, I'll do
you one better.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.321
(Growling)

12:19.000 --> 12:20.468
I love that!

12:20.500 --> 12:22.036
(Growling)

12:26.310 --> 12:27.539
- He was all drunk.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.106
But I still needed
3 guys and a shovel

12:30.150 --> 12:32.005
to take
him down.

12:32.050 --> 12:35.076
- Grabbing kids
in broad daylight.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.019
(Growling)

12:36.050 --> 12:37.711
I'm embarrassed for you.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.717
- And this is why

12:38.750 --> 12:40.309
we have cops
who work for us.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.555
They can handle this.

12:41.590 --> 12:43.058
- You take
somebody's kid,

12:43.090 --> 12:45.320
and nobody's looking to
the cops to make it right.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.521
They come to my associates.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.494
- We know nothing
about this guy.

12:48.530 --> 12:51.591
- I know he's done more to cull
the orphans than you have.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.291
(Growling)

12:56.370 --> 12:57.599
- Oh!

12:57.640 --> 12:58.607
(Laughing)

12:58.640 --> 12:59.766
What?

12:59.810 --> 13:02.131
Hey, you gotta show
me how to do that.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.018
- Heart, wood.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.084
We'll be in touch.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.827
God, Aidan,
you need a drink!

13:19.860 --> 13:22.500
(Tires screeching)

13:22.530 --> 13:24.168
You want out of
this life so badly,

13:24.200 --> 13:27.864
you should be begging
me to take his offer.

13:27.900 --> 13:31.700
Puts you on the road
to freedom from all of us...

13:31.740 --> 13:33.105
(Sighing)

13:33.140 --> 13:34.403
...from me.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.808
- Look, this was never about
getting away from you.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.673
If we turn him then
he's our responsibility,

13:41.720 --> 13:43.313
and the only thing
that we know about him is

13:43.350 --> 13:45.341
that he'd be willing
to sell out his own family

13:45.390 --> 13:46.516
for a better offer!

13:46.550 --> 13:48.257
No, there are
other options.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.758
- Like what?

13:51.990 --> 13:55.096
Turn out new vampires
the way Bishop did?

13:55.130 --> 13:58.725
Brag about going public
and ruling humans?

13:58.770 --> 14:00.090
(Scoffing)

14:00.140 --> 14:02.461
As if I would waste
my time with them.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.707
(Scoffing, sighing)

14:04.740 --> 14:09.234
- Mother says we live best
when we are least seen.

14:09.280 --> 14:09.974
- Yes.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.239
- And his offer
gets me that.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.339
- And I agree with
that philosophy,

14:13.380 --> 14:14.415
but not like this.

14:14.450 --> 14:17.112
Not with him!

14:17.150 --> 14:19.915
- She can't treat you
like this, Aidan.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.052
(Ticking)

14:21.090 --> 14:22.979
Forty minutes late.
and counting.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.054
Who does she
think she is?

14:24.090 --> 14:27.128
- She knows exactly who she is.
Let it go, Henry.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.299
- You've protected
Boston for decades,

14:29.330 --> 14:31.264
but she treats you
like her nanny.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.825
You are so far above this.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.668
- Soon enough,
she and Mother

14:34.700 --> 14:36.794
and the whole circus
will move on.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.105
- You've given everything
to this family, to Mother.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.029
And how do
they repay you?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.947
By making you do it
all over again forever.

14:44.980 --> 14:48.814
- Your concern
is touching, Henry.

14:48.850 --> 14:51.114
Wouldn't have anything
to do with the fact

14:51.150 --> 14:54.950
that more power for me means
more power for you, would it?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.981
- When you turned me,
you made it sound

14:57.030 --> 14:58.623
like steak dinners
and chorus girls.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.799
This is one step up
from a bread line.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.150
(* Classical )

15:04.170 --> 15:07.094
- Bread line? That's exactly
where you would be

15:07.140 --> 15:08.892
if it weren't for me.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.159
You are one of
the lucky few.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.133
Don't ever
forget that.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.139
And don't forget
who gave it to you.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.239
- You opened
a door for me.

15:19.280 --> 15:23.342
But now you make me stand
on the outside, looking in,

15:23.390 --> 15:27.611
Brushing shoulders with royalty
while I cool my heels out here.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.083
You make excuses
for Suren,

15:30.130 --> 15:32.224
"it's not her fault,"”

15:32.260 --> 15:34.854
blaming Mother for
giving her all this power

15:34.900 --> 15:36.197
and no responsibility.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.766
- Close your trap
or I will.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.995
- Fine.

15:39.030 --> 15:39.997
(Bell dinging)

15:40.040 --> 15:44.102
But tell me how you're
so different from Mother.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.234
How come you make
excuses for Suren

15:46.270 --> 15:48.136
and not the
child you made?

15:51.880 --> 15:54.542
- Tired of making
excuses for Suren.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.571
She thinks I'm gonna
wait one more--

16:02.220 --> 16:05.724
- I'm sorry if
I kept you waiting.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.058
- No apology necessary.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.750
But thank you.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.742
- Go to Covella's and
buy yourself a real suit.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.772
I'll talk to Mother about
putting you on Suren's detail.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.016
And wipe that smile
off your face.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.127
(Tires screeching)

16:37.160 --> 16:39.254
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

16:39.290 --> 16:43.659
Uh, I have very
sensitive retinas, so...

16:46.230 --> 16:48.733
Oh, hey.

16:48.770 --> 16:52.707
- We couldn't stick around,
but Connor wanted say thanks.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.333
- What you did
back there, man,

16:54.380 --> 16:56.974
that was a, uh,
that was a prime move.

16:57.010 --> 16:59.377
- Right. Well, I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.344
- Clearly, you don't
know my brother.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.041
- But let's change that.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.944
Please, allow us
to thank you properly.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.287
- We're
going out.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.414
You should come.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.281
- Thank you.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.729
- Come on!

17:12.760 --> 17:15.457
It's been a long time
since we met one of us

17:15.500 --> 17:17.319
that actually wanted
to hang out with.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.098
- Yeah. I don't--

17:19.130 --> 17:22.031
I've never met a brother and
sister who both got turned.

17:22.069 --> 17:24.164
How old were you guys?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.969
- Ah, we
weren't turned.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.278
We're purebreds, Josh.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.870
- YOU mean you were
born this way??

17:34.920 --> 17:36.445
(Chuckling)

17:36.480 --> 17:39.188
- You need that drink
more than I do.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.164
<i>(Engine revving)</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:53.168
(* House )

17:53.200 --> 17:57.137
(* Woman singing
on sound system, indistinct )

18:08.880 --> 18:10.712
- Have you
ever been here?

18:10.750 --> 18:13.014
- Once in college.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.155
Uh, they wouldn't
let me in.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.420
It was a private party.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.756
- Thanks, Cochise.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.962
- Thank you,
Mr. Cochise.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.860
- His name's
not Cochise.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.368
- Your brother just
called him that.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.061
- He calls everybody that

18:31.110 --> 18:34.136
so he doesn't have to
remember their names.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.875
- Does he know
he sounds like a tool?

18:35.910 --> 18:37.799
- You know,
I'd like to say no,

18:37.850 --> 18:41.411
but I have seen him practice
his "Cochises" in the mirror.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.646
- Oh, if it isn't my
favourite mind reader.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.546
Come here.
Mmm! Mmm!

18:49.420 --> 18:51.923
(Chuckling)

18:51.960 --> 18:54.952
This guy with his little wallet
and everything. Adorable!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.559
- Yeah, yeah.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.193
That's because I come
from a planet

18:58.230 --> 19:01.097
where people actually
have to pay for things.

19:05.370 --> 19:08.032
- I don't, uh,
I don't really party.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.377
(Sniffing)

19:09.410 --> 19:11.879
Do people still call it
that even? I don't--

19:11.910 --> 19:12.877
- It's OK.

19:12.910 --> 19:15.709
- Yeah, I'm--I'm---

19:15.750 --> 19:17.445
- It's aconite.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.845
- Which is druggie-speak
for what exactly?

19:19.890 --> 19:24.225
- It's not a drug, it's a herb.
Most people call it wolfsbane.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.228
It's like wolf Xanax.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.592
- So why does he
need to take it?

19:28.630 --> 19:31.327
- You know how you
feel before a turn?

19:31.370 --> 19:32.519
Your senses are on fire,

19:32.570 --> 19:36.268
you're sharp but you kind of
wanna jump out of your own skin?

19:39.010 --> 19:40.774
That's how we feel
all the time.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.674
- That's how you knew
I was a wolf.

19:44.710 --> 19:47.247
- Yeah, and why Connor
acts like an idiot

19:47.280 --> 19:50.215
unless he gets a little
aconite to take the edge off.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.685
- So he's not trying
to get high?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.256
- No.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.587
He's trying
to be normal.

20:01.860 --> 20:02.850
- I don't know why

20:02.900 --> 20:04.459
I froze up with Dr. Forest.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.059
There's something about him.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.035
He's too good-looking
or too smooth.

20:09.070 --> 20:10.367
- Too not dead.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.708
- I think you're way more
into him than I am.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.401
- But you're human.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.171
- Oh, don't remind me.
Ghosts are easier.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.872
No time to waste,
just wanna move on.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.378
- If ghosts are
so well-adjusted,

20:21.420 --> 20:23.946
then why do they need
a support group?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.685
- They want resolution.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.040
Didn't say
they have it.

20:27.090 --> 20:28.819
(Whooshing)

20:28.860 --> 20:30.157
- Oh dear.

20:30.190 --> 20:31.351
- What?

20:31.390 --> 20:33.119
- Dude with ponytail,
twelve o'clock,

20:33.160 --> 20:35.128
looks like he died
on a retreat.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.423
- Hey, Gus.

20:36.460 --> 20:40.761
- OK, braless lady
with the drawstring pants.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.938
- That'd be Jane.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.064
- I can hear the
over-sharing now.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.738
- They need help,
just like you.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.078
- Blech.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.078
You know what?
I know I said

20:50.110 --> 20:52.340
that I'd give this
a try, but, um,

20:52.380 --> 20:54.144
these aren't my people,

20:54.180 --> 20:56.239
so I'm just gonna--

20:56.280 --> 20:58.009
Nick?

20:58.050 --> 21:01.111
- You 2 know each other?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.151
- Uh, from college. Hi.

21:03.190 --> 21:04.351
- And after.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.188
- Hmm...

21:06.230 --> 21:09.894
If we were alive, this is where
we'd have to decide on, um...

21:09.930 --> 21:11.000
- (Chloe):
Hey, Walter.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.998
- ...going for
the awkward hug.

21:13.030 --> 21:15.135
- Yeah, so glad
that's off the table.

21:15.170 --> 21:19.334
- Um, I'm sorry about that--
- I'm sorry I was so harsh.

21:19.370 --> 21:20.678
- No, I was a wuss.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.674
Anyway, I'm--
I'm glad you're here.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.542
- Me too.

21:26.580 --> 21:29.277
(Chloe and ghosts
talking, indistinct)

21:30.250 --> 21:31.740
- Mom and Dad
traced our line

21:31.790 --> 21:34.157
back to Scotland
12 or 13 generations.

21:34.190 --> 21:36.386
We still have an estate
in the highlands.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.424
- Wow! You guys
ever been or...

21:39.460 --> 21:42.657
- Nah. I try to make it to the
British Open in St. Andrew's,

21:42.700 --> 21:44.464
but otherwise,
why bother, right?

21:44.500 --> 21:47.492
- Yeah, I don't even really know
how to respond to that.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.191
I mean, I can see that
you're speaking English.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.708
I know your lips
are moving, but--

21:51.740 --> 21:53.902
- I know it's not a life
you hear about everyday.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.374
But neither is yours.

21:55.410 --> 21:58.277
- Yeah, how'd you go from
MIT to being an orderly?

21:58.310 --> 21:59.573
What am I missing here?

21:59.610 --> 22:03.683
- Maybe the part where
I turn into a canine,

22:03.720 --> 22:05.518
a serial killer
once a month.

22:05.550 --> 22:08.212
- Please, don't be one
of those people

22:08.260 --> 22:09.716
who uses the wolf
as an excuse.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.185
- I'm not making excuses,
but it is a reality.

22:13.230 --> 22:15.255
I'm trying to deal.
I'm--I'm tr--

22:16.960 --> 22:18.519
Trying to find a cure.

22:19.870 --> 22:23.363
- What, you're looking
for a cure too?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.707
- Oh, come on,
you make it seem

22:24.740 --> 22:26.367
like you're slaving
away in a lab.

22:26.410 --> 22:28.435
- I've been thinking
about it for years!

22:28.480 --> 22:30.300
- Mmm! Same way you think
about solar power

22:30.340 --> 22:32.206
and ways to
destroy the yen?

22:32.250 --> 22:33.342
- Yeah.
Come on.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.144
What you got?
Show me your work.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.272
- I only started
last month.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.345
It's not like
I've got endless cash

22:38.390 --> 22:40.552
to pay for
research, you know?

22:40.590 --> 22:41.989
- Right, but what
if you did?

22:42.020 --> 22:43.579
- No, you're
misunderstanding.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.654
That's now what I meant.

22:44.690 --> 22:47.079
I'm not asking for your help.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.224
- I'm offering, Josh.
So where's the lab?

22:49.260 --> 22:50.466
I'll come by tomorrow.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.696
- I shouldn't have
brought it up.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.461
- So now you're not even
gonna tell me where it is?

22:55.500 --> 22:58.265
You serious about it or you
just wanna clean piss pots

22:58.310 --> 22:59.459
for the rest of your life?

23:00.510 --> 23:03.400
- Wow! The wolfsbane
wears off fast.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.270
- OK, everybody
just calm down.

23:05.310 --> 23:07.278
Connor, let it go.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.380
- No, no, no...

23:08.420 --> 23:11.390
Why am I the jerk, hmm?

23:11.420 --> 23:14.185
We take him out, we treat
him like one of us.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.210
(Laughing sarcastically)

23:15.260 --> 23:16.682
And now I try to help the guy

23:16.720 --> 23:18.688
and I'm the
jackass, yeah?

23:18.730 --> 23:22.360
- Last train's
in 10 minutes.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.220
I'm gonna go.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.433
- Brynn, it was really
nice meeting you.

23:27.470 --> 23:29.199
Here you go.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.732
(Chuckling)

23:34.740 --> 23:40.679
- It's been 10 months and 2 days
since my last possession. Um...

23:40.720 --> 23:45.146
Today I saw a guy playing
with his stupid dog.

23:45.190 --> 23:49.286
I wanted to remember
that feeling so bad,

23:49.320 --> 23:51.357
I almost jumped in.

23:51.390 --> 23:55.725
And then I remembered
how it wrecked me,

23:55.760 --> 23:58.764
How it almost
destroyed me.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.464
Well, the more I did it,
the more I needed it.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.264
Well, then I
met you guys,

24:04.310 --> 24:05.562
Got clean.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.305
(All chuckling)

24:07.340 --> 24:10.275
Now I know I can make it
to 10 months and 3 days.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.471
- (Man): Wow!

24:11.510 --> 24:13.274
- Thanks, Walter.
- (Woman): Good job.

24:13.310 --> 24:16.940
- All right, everyone.
See you next week.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.509
- (Man):
OK, thanks.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.619
- I wanted you to know

24:24.660 --> 24:27.721
that you are the reason
I started coming here.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.250
- I am.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.270
- You calling me an "emo" loser

24:32.300 --> 24:33.893
in love with
my own drama,

24:33.940 --> 24:36.659
- made me realize
it was time to get help.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.429
- I never said that...

24:38.470 --> 24:39.460
out loud.

24:39.510 --> 24:40.932
(Chuckling)

24:40.980 --> 24:43.278
- It was the kick in
the butt that I needed.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.209
- Hmm!

24:44.250 --> 24:48.209
- Hey, I heard about
a micro-gastronomy place

24:48.250 --> 24:49.547
that opened up near Copley.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.446
If I promise
no death talk,

24:51.490 --> 24:54.858
you want to, uh,
go haunt the kitchen?

24:54.890 --> 24:55.709
- Yeah.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.659
- Yeah?

24:56.690 --> 24:57.953
- Yeah, I'd like that.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.321
- Cool.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.760
(Groaning)

25:15.480 --> 25:17.175
(Groaning)

25:19.280 --> 25:20.611
- Come on!

25:20.650 --> 25:22.414
(Heart pounding)

25:24.950 --> 25:27.317
- Hi.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.886
Is Tracy here?

25:28.920 --> 25:31.184
- No, I'm Darla.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.525
But she said you might
need something.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.922
(Grunting)

25:41.670 --> 25:43.490
(Grunting)

25:47.710 --> 25:50.008
- I can't believe
how good Nick looks.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.475
That whole mopey sheen
was just gone.

25:52.510 --> 25:55.150
- It's amazing how
much he's changed.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.444
- And can you believe that
I triggered all that?

25:57.480 --> 25:58.914
Ah, ah!

25:58.950 --> 26:01.419
It's, like, I mean,
if he's really gotten better,

26:01.460 --> 26:04.282
then maybe I will
start dating him again.

26:04.330 --> 26:08.198
- Again? Nick never
told me you two dated.

26:08.230 --> 26:11.393
- Well, we kind of
just bumped energies

26:11.430 --> 26:13.125
a couple times
in my kitchen.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.365
(Chuckling)

26:14.400 --> 26:17.461
- He never mentioned
that either.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.400
- Why would he?

26:19.440 --> 26:23.035
- Because we're sort of
seeing each other.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.417
- You--you are?

26:29.450 --> 26:31.544
- I figured you didn't know.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.685
Why else would you mention
the energy-bumping?

26:34.720 --> 26:35.858
Uh, so--

26:35.890 --> 26:37.380
- Wow! That's, uh...

26:39.390 --> 26:41.859
That's great.
Really good.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.164
- Is it?
- Yeah! Yes!

26:44.200 --> 26:46.419
Yes, so very great.

26:46.470 --> 26:47.392
- We think so too.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.730
And none of it would've
happened without you.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.829
You pushing
Dr. Tim so hard

26:52.870 --> 26:55.931
made me ask myself
what I really wanted.

26:55.980 --> 26:58.244
- And you wanted Nick.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.645
Ha! Well, that--

26:59.680 --> 27:00.715
I mean, that's good,

27:00.750 --> 27:03.469
because I told you that
we would find somebody.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.649
I was actually talking
about somebody human,

27:06.690 --> 27:08.351
like you,

27:08.390 --> 27:11.553
but those
are details.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.126
- I don't know
where it's going.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.653
I mean, where can it go?

27:16.700 --> 27:18.464
- I don't know.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.389
- But right now
it kind of feels

27:20.430 --> 27:23.263
like what they talk
about in junior high,

27:23.300 --> 27:25.701
like a first love, and...

27:26.910 --> 27:28.435
I never got that.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.504
(Chuckling)

27:29.540 --> 27:31.747
- Big yay!

27:31.780 --> 27:33.919
(Panting)

27:35.380 --> 27:37.348
(Breathing unevenly)

27:51.400 --> 27:54.597
- Yuck, you look
like I feel.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.962
- What happened to your, uh,
quiet night at home?

27:58.010 --> 28:02.880
- Turns out psycho-ward werewolf
and his sister like to party.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.309
Mmm!

28:04.350 --> 28:06.500
And this you're
gonna love.

28:06.550 --> 28:08.279
They want to help me
find a cure.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.414
- Bastards.
- Oh, no, no, no.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.748
No, you'd turn them down too
if you met them.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.554
They're pretty hateable.

28:14.590 --> 28:16.285
- OK.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.880
- That's your "judge-y" OK.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.622
Don't. Listen, in my defence,
I would've hated them

28:22.660 --> 28:24.628
just as much before
I was attacked.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.833
Connor's that guy who got the
new car at 16 then crashed it,

28:27.870 --> 28:30.339
so his parents bought him
a better one at 17.

28:30.370 --> 28:33.738
And I'm pretty she had a pony
when she was a little girl

28:33.780 --> 28:35.839
right up until the day
that she ate it!

28:35.880 --> 28:38.042
And she's the
one I like!

28:38.080 --> 28:41.277
Man, they're--they're rich,
they're entitled.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.742
- Mm-hmm.

28:42.780 --> 28:43.747
(Sighing)

28:43.790 --> 28:46.316
Yeah, they do
sound hateable.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.387
- Oh, come on.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.852
(* Women singing opera )

28:59.370 --> 29:01.759
- I need you to finish me off.

29:05.870 --> 29:06.940
- Of course.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.908
- Why do you think Mother
assigned you as my escort?

29:12.950 --> 29:17.342
- Because anyone else
would've thrown you off a roof.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.986
- Has it been
that awful?

29:20.020 --> 29:21.818
- It's had its perks.

29:23.890 --> 29:27.895
- I think Mother knew exactly
what she was doing

29:27.930 --> 29:29.295
when she chose you.

29:33.070 --> 29:35.562
What if we had met
on the street,

29:35.600 --> 29:38.729
just 2 strangers,

29:38.770 --> 29:40.977
instead of you
always telling me no

29:41.010 --> 29:42.933
and me having to
outsmart you?

29:42.980 --> 29:45.870
- I expect we would have
liked each other very much,

29:45.910 --> 29:49.574
until I got to know you
and threw you off a roof.

29:51.520 --> 29:55.058
- You told me it was time
to make my own decisions.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.582
But you were wrong
about one thing.

29:57.620 --> 30:01.500
I will never be allowed
out of Mother's shadow,

30:01.530 --> 30:05.489
unless I leave,
give up all this.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.897
I never saw
a better option,

30:09.940 --> 30:12.102
until now...

30:13.440 --> 30:15.374
until you.

30:19.810 --> 30:21.869
(Trolley bell dinging
in distance)

30:27.150 --> 30:28.481
- Suren...

30:28.520 --> 30:29.612
(Swallowing)

30:29.660 --> 30:31.389
- Come on, Aidan.

30:34.660 --> 30:37.049
- We didn't meet
as strangers.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.023
(Breathing heavily)

30:47.140 --> 30:49.700
- Aidan! But?

30:49.740 --> 30:51.970
- But how many
people are there

30:52.010 --> 30:55.674
who know what you're
going through and will help?

30:57.080 --> 30:59.048
- What would you do?

30:59.090 --> 31:04.620
- If accepting their offer
will lead you to a cure,

31:04.660 --> 31:05.786
take it.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.958
Give yourself a break.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.798
- We're always saying no

31:09.830 --> 31:11.969
to people like
them, because...

31:13.200 --> 31:16.329
because we're afraid
of becoming them,

31:16.370 --> 31:17.792
but we don't have to.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.476
Saying yes gets
you your life back.

31:22.510 --> 31:24.672
Say yes.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.600
I'm tired of fighting, Suren.

31:41.630 --> 31:44.395
You want to turn this mobster,
let's turn him.

31:49.170 --> 31:51.730
(Honking)

31:51.770 --> 31:54.933
- You have a royal
begging you for it.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.108
- And you have some stones
listening in on us.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.801
- All you had to
do was say yes,

31:58.850 --> 32:00.204
and everything would
be different for us.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.844
- It would've been a disaster.
They're not like us.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.542
Consequences for
their actions roll downhill.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.319
- This was our chance!

32:07.350 --> 32:09.352
- Anyone who gets
in bed with the royal

32:09.390 --> 32:11.586
may as well stick his
head in a guillotine.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.655
- You always said
Suren was different.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.294
Why not try?

32:18.300 --> 32:20.359
- You don't think
I've considered it?

32:20.400 --> 32:21.595
Mother would
never allow it.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.438
Suren and I would
have to disappear.

32:23.470 --> 32:26.701
Two suitcases, 2 train tickets
and never look back and she--

32:26.740 --> 32:29.937
She's not ready
to give this up.

32:29.980 --> 32:31.778
- You wouldn't
have to run.

32:31.810 --> 32:33.676
Stay on Mother's
good side.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.678
We can have
what they have.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.587
- And in a thousand
years, we will.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.453
- But we could
have it now.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.152
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.227
Don't tell me
you don't want it.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.659
- It?

32:47.690 --> 32:51.194
I'm sorry, Henry.
Don't you mean "her"?

32:55.270 --> 32:56.533
Or maybe...

32:57.940 --> 33:00.762
you were never thinking
about Suren at all.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.746
- You looked happy
to see me

33:05.780 --> 33:08.317
and you asked me to go
to a restaurant,

33:08.350 --> 33:11.240
so was I crazy to think
that was a date?

33:11.290 --> 33:13.349
- No, I did want
to see you again,

33:13.390 --> 33:16.382
uh, to thank you
for not dating me,

33:16.420 --> 33:19.549
because that's what
led me to Zoe.

33:19.590 --> 33:20.989
(Seagulls squawking)

33:21.030 --> 33:23.727
- What is that
about, really?

33:23.760 --> 33:25.728
And you have,
like, 50 years

33:25.770 --> 33:28.990
before either of you can
get any ghost nookie.

33:30.370 --> 33:31.906
- You thought
a lot about this.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.307
- Yeah, well somebody should.

33:34.340 --> 33:37.275
Look, Zoe's a really good person
and you're a great guy, Nick,

33:37.310 --> 33:38.345
you really are.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.609
But you're
messed up.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.039
You relive your death
every single day

33:42.080 --> 33:43.013
so that you feel alive.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.017
- Mm-hmm.

33:44.050 --> 33:45.188
- That's extra points

33:45.220 --> 33:47.314
on the crazy test, Nick.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.909
And Zoe deserves
better than that.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.157
- You're right. That's why
I stopped doing it.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.619
- What do you mean?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.719
- Once I started
hanging out with Zoe,

33:58.770 --> 34:01.068
I don't know, the whole
reliving-my-death thing,

34:01.100 --> 34:02.898
I didn't need it,

34:02.940 --> 34:04.829
so I stopped.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.704
(Boat horn honking
in distance)

34:10.810 --> 34:12.699
- It was that easy?

34:12.750 --> 34:15.674
- Yeah.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.018
- Well, why didn't you
ever try it with me?

34:18.050 --> 34:19.643
- I don't know.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.288
I guess I wasn't ready.

34:28.030 --> 34:29.759
- So when it came
down to it,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.518
you'd rather die every
single day than date me?

34:41.409 --> 34:44.971
- Like I said, it's not
the Manhattan Project, but...

34:45.010 --> 34:46.444
- Wow!

34:46.480 --> 34:47.969
Nope.

34:48.010 --> 34:49.876
(Chuckling)

34:49.920 --> 34:52.047
What is all
this junk?

34:54.989 --> 34:57.118
- It's pretty basic
stuff, actually.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.027
I videotape the turn,
record temperatures,

35:00.060 --> 35:01.357
see what kind of
EKG ratings I can get

35:01.400 --> 35:04.859
before the wolf eats
through the wires.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.528
- Well, what exactly are
you looking for?

35:07.570 --> 35:09.834
- Whatever makes us
different during the change.

35:09.870 --> 35:12.532
There must be some kind
of mutation I can pinpoint.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.937
- OK, so let's say
you had more money,

35:14.980 --> 35:17.699
what would you do first?

35:17.740 --> 35:19.640
(Clearing throat)

35:21.620 --> 35:23.770
- I'd start with MRIs,

35:23.820 --> 35:25.982
as close to the
full moon as possible,

35:26.020 --> 35:27.613
and a full blood panel.

35:27.650 --> 35:31.359
If I can find out what the
trigger is that makes us turn

35:31.390 --> 35:32.789
and control it,
I can turn it off

35:32.830 --> 35:34.525
and we can say goodbye
to the pooch for good.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.689
- You're saying that this
trigger that you're looking for,

35:37.730 --> 35:40.620
if you can turn it off
then I can turn it on, right?

35:40.670 --> 35:44.038
- In theory,
you could. Yeah.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.009
(Both laughing)

35:48.540 --> 35:49.905
Why, you guys--

35:49.940 --> 35:53.478
You guys want to be
wolves all the time.

35:53.510 --> 35:56.719
This is just a huge
mistake. Get out!

35:56.750 --> 35:57.842
No, no! Get out!

35:57.880 --> 35:59.882
- No! Wait.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.046
- Get out! Get out!

36:01.090 --> 36:03.718
- Wait! We can help
each other!

36:03.760 --> 36:06.582
- By turning you into a monster
every minute of every day?

36:06.630 --> 36:08.655
No.
- Brynn, let's go.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.758
Right now.
- Just hold on.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.325
- Just forget about
him, all right?

36:11.370 --> 36:14.692
He's just another
small-minded mutt!

36:14.740 --> 36:18.131
All right.
I'll be in the car.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.070
- Listen to me.

36:24.110 --> 36:28.069
The wolf is
everything I hate.

36:28.110 --> 36:30.818
I can't just let it
out into the world.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.683
- If I felt that way,
I wouldn't either.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.687
But I don't.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.884
Everything I see,
taste, do,

36:38.930 --> 36:41.524
it is all deadened
because of this,

36:41.560 --> 36:45.724
defective eyes,
weak-ass nose,

36:45.770 --> 36:47.966
lousy instincts.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.608
Everything that's special,
everything that I love about me,

36:52.640 --> 36:53.937
I have to push down.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.870
- This is the best
version of you.

36:55.910 --> 36:58.470
I don't want it
to go away.

36:58.510 --> 36:59.909
- I do.

36:59.950 --> 37:03.875
You feel like a monster
one night a month,

37:03.920 --> 37:05.888
like something's taking
over your body.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.740
Think of how
it is for us.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.525
That feeling of
being trapped,

37:11.560 --> 37:14.825
of knowing that the best part
of you is being held captive

37:14.860 --> 37:16.919
by a monster
that you hate

37:16.960 --> 37:19.622
you feel like that
one day a month.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.189
Connor and I feel
like that the other 29.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.845
(Zoe and Nick giggling)

37:39.650 --> 37:41.459
(Giggling)

37:44.760 --> 37:47.582
(Both chuckling)

37:54.940 --> 37:56.863
- (Man):
Good night, Dr. Forest.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.163
- Good night, Paul.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.929
(Women talking, indistinct)

38:09.780 --> 38:10.850
(Chuckling)

38:10.880 --> 38:11.847
Hey.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.380
- Hey, you.

38:13.420 --> 38:14.558
- Baby!

38:18.830 --> 38:21.458
So, how are you?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.649
- Good.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.775
- I promise you,
you won't regret this.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.801
- Just sit back.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.070
You won't feel a thing.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.216
You have a legend
for a maker.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.139
(Grunts)

38:56.760 --> 38:58.592
(Teeth clicking)

39:03.840 --> 39:04.966
(Slurping)

39:05.010 --> 39:07.263
- Well, I'll be damned.

39:07.310 --> 39:09.779
- By the time
you wake up,

39:09.810 --> 39:11.574
yes, you will.

39:12.310 --> 39:15.245
(Gasping)

39:15.280 --> 39:16.816
(* Man singing opera )

39:16.850 --> 39:18.272
(Whimpering)

39:20.120 --> 39:22.259
(* Singing continues )

39:24.090 --> 39:26.081
- Suren?

39:26.130 --> 39:29.657
You're right. I-I-I don't care
what Mother says.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.759
I just want--

39:44.380 --> 39:46.178
- Get out.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.679
- We were kind of in
the middle of something.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.371
- I gave you everything!

39:51.420 --> 39:54.082
- Well, now you don't
have to anymore.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.583
I have her.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.224
(Record scratching)

39:59.260 --> 40:00.921
- I warned you
how this ends.

40:03.230 --> 40:04.766
- You made
your choice.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.796
So have 1.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.365
- Whoa!

40:11.400 --> 40:13.334
Whoa! What's he doing?

40:13.370 --> 40:16.670
- He's coming
back to us.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.147
(Groaning)

40:23.180 --> 40:26.184
He's right, Aidan.
It's too much.

40:26.220 --> 40:28.757
You're gonna Kill him.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.212
(Groaning)

40:30.260 --> 40:32.354
I told you
he'd be useful.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.938
- This time...

40:47.970 --> 40:49.938
she's mine.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.148
(Groaning)

40:57.080 --> 41:00.118
(Moaning)

41:03.890 --> 41:05.949
- (Nora): Hi, it's me.
I'm not here.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.981
So leave a message
after the beep.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.020
(Beep)

41:09.060 --> 41:12.325
- Hey, Nora. So those twins
I told you about,

41:12.370 --> 41:15.089
I want you to
meet them after all.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.290
Um, I need your take.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.705
(Growling)

41:18.740 --> 41:20.606
I mean, they're weird.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.278
I don't know, there's this
other side to them.

41:26.910 --> 41:30.972
I think deep down,
we all want the same thing.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.284
(Crickets chirping)

41:33.320 --> 41:35.015
(Kissing)

41:35.060 --> 41:39.827

(Chuckling)

41:48.030 --> 41:50.032
- It should illegal
to be this happy.

41:50.070 --> 41:52.334
- Barf.

41:52.370 --> 41:55.271
- Let's just not break up
again to get here.

41:55.310 --> 41:56.607
- Deal.

41:58.240 --> 42:02.370
<i>* I don't know
anything about this</i>

42:02.420 --> 42:06.311

42:10.320 --> 42:12.220

- Perfect.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.374

42:33.810 --> 42:36.120

to be pissed.
