WEBVTT

00:06.960 --> 00:10.200
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:33.200 --> 01:36.440
-How are you feeling?
-Happy to be here with my sister.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.800
I've always had a weird feeling
something was missing.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.560
And now that I'm here with you, it's gone.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.800
And now that we're here,
at peace with the past,

01:52.320 --> 01:54.400
we just have to face the present.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.640
I hope everything goes well
at the competition.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.000
To me, you're already the winner.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.640
No matter what the result might be.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.840
And we're gonna celebrate together,

02:08.360 --> 02:09.320
singing

02:10.560 --> 02:12.480
as sisters at Save Cielo.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.640
Considering you're going third,
let's go with the original plan.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.880
Remember your run has to intimidate Steffi
so she feels pressured.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.200
That sounds perfect.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.200
Steffi will have the pressure of
going last after seeing your perfect run.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.760
That will make her nervous.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.960
If you focus on what we've already
envisioned, the competition will be ours.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.560
-Hey, have you seen Steffi?
-No, no idea.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.000
And the girls? They disappeared again.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.880
They went with Julián and Tony
to camp for the night.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.400
Those who aren't in the friend zone
have their own club, Nati.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.160
-I'm happy for them.
-Come on, Nati. Look.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.360
Our club is way better.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.400
Guys, Charlie just sent me the order.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.960
It's Velayos, Lambert, Rossi, Navarro.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.680
Right after Natasha.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.960
On the plus side, we can manage the risk.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.920
We have to assume
Natasha is gonna have a perfect run.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.760
It's good to have a strategic plan.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.520
If Natasha has an excellent run,

03:43.600 --> 03:47.040
then you'll have to go with the 720
at the end of your run.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.840
That's where you'll gain an advantage.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.120
But only if it's necessary.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.200
We should go. I'll get the canoes ready.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.640
Okay. I'll go with you.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.720
How are you feeling, Steffi?

04:08.800 --> 04:09.640
Really good.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.160
Being here helped me a lot.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.720
I'm ready.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.960
Take it to medical, guys. Thanks.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.240
Nati, Charlie, just in time.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.640
You need to organize
and usher the spectators.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.000
When the judges arrive,
coordinate with them.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.000
-They need anything, tell me.
-Everything's under control.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.600
Let's go look for more fences
for the riders' area.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.160
<i>This is my world, which has fallen</i>

04:40.240 --> 04:43.320
<i>And it is like that, I am already sunk</i>

04:43.400 --> 04:46.720
<i>It is tonight that I call you</i>

04:46.800 --> 04:49.760
<i>To tell you that I do love you</i>

04:49.840 --> 04:52.680
<i>Again, my heart dropped and broke</i>

04:52.760 --> 04:55.760
<i>I tried again and it didn't work out again</i>

04:55.840 --> 04:59.680
<i>I want to know if one day</i>
<i>You will love me like I do</i>

04:59.760 --> 05:02.680
<i>And I give you all my love</i>

05:02.760 --> 05:04.600
<i>I see the truth, I can't--</i>

05:06.360 --> 05:09.920
No. Move the microphones
away from the speaker. It causes feedback.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.000
-I should move it back?
-Yeah. A little further.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.880
Try now.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.760
One, two, testing.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.080
Yes, you're incredible.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.400
-You too. You were right.
-I'm always right, little skunk.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.640
I like those butterflies.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.440
The sharks suck.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.040
Are you kidding?
They're the best out of all.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.960
They don't seem interesting.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.160
But I'm not gonna disagree
with my little chameleon.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.080
-It's time for the competition to start.
-Let's go.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.880
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.120
-Should we go?
-I don't think so.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.240
Or should we?

06:00.320 --> 06:02.480
We could do something for the show.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.280
-Something?
-I just thought of something.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.640
All right, that's the boat.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.520
Here are your forms.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.320
When you determine the score,
pass it to me, and I'll make a note.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.720
If you need anything, let me know.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.960
-We're ready.
-Whenever you want, we'll join in.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.040
The camera setup is done. We're streaming.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.000
It's all you.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.040
Friends!

06:39.120 --> 06:42.520
<i>This is Cielo Grande Summer Crush.</i>

06:43.640 --> 06:49.640
After streaming the competition,
we're having the Save Cielo show.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.400
The page is already running,

06:51.480 --> 06:54.240
and you can make your donations
starting now.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.480
<i>So cool, Charlie.</i>

06:55.560 --> 06:57.840
<i>-I want to be the first to donate.</i>
<i>-Seriously?</i>

06:57.920 --> 06:58.760
<i>Ready.</i>

06:59.280 --> 07:02.800
The first donation
is already on the Save Cielo page.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.720
-Thanks, Juan, for your support.
-No.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.320
<i>-I'm Juan.</i>
<i>-I am.</i>

07:06.400 --> 07:07.520
<i>-Yeah?</i>
<i>-No, I am.</i>

07:07.600 --> 07:08.760
<i>No! I am.</i>

07:08.840 --> 07:12.040
All right,
the competition is about to start.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.320
<i>Such anxiety.</i>

07:15.640 --> 07:18.960
Hello. How are you?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.960
<i>Welcome one and all.</i>

07:22.040 --> 07:26.240
<i>Let's start</i>
<i>the Cielo Grande Summer Crush competition.</i>

07:28.280 --> 07:32.320
<i>First up, we have the men's pro category</i>
<i>followed by women's pro.</i>

07:32.400 --> 07:34.800
The men are already ready.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.520
And since
it's a tradition at Cielo Grande…

07:38.040 --> 07:39.960
DONATE

07:42.280 --> 07:46.680
<i>For the men's pro category,</i>
<i>Rovegno, come to the starting point.</i>

08:13.080 --> 08:16.880
<i>Bessi, come to the starting point.</i>

08:16.960 --> 08:20.560
Awesome run from Rovegno with 93 points,

08:20.640 --> 08:23.560
our first participant
in the men's category.

08:23.640 --> 08:28.200
And we're excited
to have Steffi's dad here,

08:28.280 --> 08:32.480
Ron Navarro, one of the winners
of this very competition.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.160
With us, Ron Navarro. Hi, Ron.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.400
<i>Thank you so much. I'm very happy</i>
<i>to be back here at Cielo Grande,</i>

08:39.480 --> 08:42.600
<i>this time as a spectator</i>
<i>supporting my daughter, Steffi.</i>

08:42.680 --> 08:45.360
To save Cielo Grande too, right?

08:45.440 --> 08:48.960
<i>Since you're an important person</i>
<i>in the history of this competition,</i>

08:49.040 --> 08:50.520
I imagine you'll donate.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.880
You can count on it.

08:51.960 --> 08:56.560
<i>What's more, I thought I'd donate $100</i>
<i>for every point Steffi gets.</i>

08:56.640 --> 08:58.240
Seriously?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.040
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

09:00.120 --> 09:05.680
<i>If Steffi gets a perfect 100,</i>
<i>he will donate $10,000.</i>

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
<i>Thanks, Ron.</i>

09:07.560 --> 09:09.920
<i>-Let's hope so.</i>
<i>-Yes. Go, Steffi.</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:16.920
<i>Calling all participants for women's pro.</i>

09:17.000 --> 09:19.560
<i>You should make your way</i>
<i>to the competitors' area.</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:21.880
<i>The next participant, Jorge Blasi.</i>

09:30.960 --> 09:32.400
Hi. Steffi Navarro.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.200
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.280
Thanks.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.240
-Look at her arriving at the last minute.
-Great.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.720
The competition
would be boring without her.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.080
<i>The final participant</i>
<i>in the men's pro category,</i>

10:12.160 --> 10:14.640
<i>Ferreiro, come to the starting point.</i>

10:16.480 --> 10:17.360
Breathe.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.400
Inhale cold

10:20.320 --> 10:21.280
and exhale warm.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.640
Perfect. Again.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.520
Continue that breathing.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.840
You have the technique down.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.920
What's important is that you use it
to visualize the run, okay?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.120
You're ready.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.680
It's time to announce

11:09.760 --> 11:13.080
the results of the men's pro category.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.680
Rovegno, 93.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.200
Bessi, 88 points.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.560
And Scandalori, 89.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.520
Blasi, 87.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.200
And Ferreiro, with 80 points.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.600
<i>Winner, Augusto Rovegno.</i>

11:28.680 --> 11:30.120
<i>Congratulations, bro!</i>

11:32.000 --> 11:36.640
I wanted to thank all the fans of Cielo
who've worked together until now.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.480
<i>And up next, the girls' round.</i>

11:40.560 --> 11:43.560
Remember after the awards ceremony

11:43.640 --> 11:48.240
is the Save Cielo show at Sky Vibes.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.720
<i>First participant</i>
<i>in the women's pro category,</i>

11:51.800 --> 11:54.600
<i>Lambert, come to the starting point.</i>

12:26.400 --> 12:27.480
<i>E ai galera!</i>

12:27.560 --> 12:31.400
Good run from Lambert,
who is starting off the girls' category.

12:33.360 --> 12:37.760
Eighty-three points.
Really good result from Lambert,

12:37.840 --> 12:41.520
especially considering
the Cielo Grande Summer Crush

12:41.600 --> 12:43.960
is her first international competition.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.640
Bravo!

12:45.720 --> 12:48.600
<i>Next participant</i>
<i>in the women's pro category,</i>

12:48.680 --> 12:51.320
<i>Paula Velayos, come to the starting point.</i>

12:51.840 --> 12:52.720
Thanks.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.040
-Ready?
-Totally ready.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.120
Well, it's time.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.200
Remember the plan.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.960
A conservative run. You don't need
to take a risk on your last trick.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.640
<i>Next participant,</i>

13:09.720 --> 13:12.680
<i>Natasha Rossi, come to the starting point.</i>

13:15.280 --> 13:17.920
The next participant

13:18.000 --> 13:24.040
is none other than Natasha Rossi,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.520
the big candidate of this event.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.840
<i>Incrível.</i>

14:16.440 --> 14:22.600
Natasha Rossi finishing
after a spectacular run.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.560
Let's see what the judges think.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.560
That was perfect, Natasha.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.400
It seems like Nati has gotten the scores
from the judges.

14:41.480 --> 14:47.960
She's going over to the scoreboard,
and Natasha Rossi's score is…

14:53.520 --> 14:55.080
<i>96 points!</i>

14:55.160 --> 14:56.040
Yes!

14:57.800 --> 14:59.760
Impressive!

14:59.840 --> 15:02.600
The judges gave
Natasha Rossi a great score.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.880
That was an almost perfect run.

15:05.960 --> 15:10.560
<i>Final participant, Steffi Navarro,</i>
<i>come to the starting point.</i>

15:10.640 --> 15:12.400
And the only run left

15:13.240 --> 15:19.560
is Steffi Navarro!

15:19.640 --> 15:24.520
Remember, her father is gonna donate
$100 for every point she gets.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.400
Steffi could really help
save Cielo Grande.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.320
Go, Steffi.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.640
Steffi Navarro is ready to start her run.

15:31.720 --> 15:36.080
She needs to score more than 96 points
to win against Natasha Rossi,

15:36.160 --> 15:37.880
who is the competition leader.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.200
<i>Will she be able to do it?</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:48.640
Steffi recently recovered
from a training accident

15:48.720 --> 15:50.480
right here at Cielo Grande.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.320
A fun fact for the fans.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.560
Yesterday she spent the night
meditating on the riverbank.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.360
Let's go!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.120
All right, Steffi!

16:17.960 --> 16:19.440
-Steffi!
-All right!

16:23.840 --> 16:25.760
<i>If Natasha has an excellent run,</i>

16:25.840 --> 16:28.960
<i>then you'll have to go with the 720</i>
<i>at the end of your run.</i>

16:51.720 --> 16:55.760
Yeah! Go, Steffi! Go!

17:01.840 --> 17:04.600
Great, Steffi! Bravo!

17:04.680 --> 17:07.240
Excellent performance from Steffi.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.560
The style was really incredible,

17:10.640 --> 17:14.080
and she took a risk
with an impressive 720.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.360
Great 720.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.240
Yeah, I hope it's enough.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
Now's the time to announce

17:26.720 --> 17:29.760
the results of the women's pro category.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.080
Lambert with 83.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.880
Velayos, 85.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.960
Rossi, 96.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.200
And now we'll find out Steffi Navarro's.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.640
Let's see what the judges thought.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.360
There's a lot of tension in the crowd.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.440
And the score?

17:58.120 --> 18:01.000
Steffi Navarro's score is…

18:05.600 --> 18:07.520
Ninety-five points,

18:07.600 --> 18:11.160
which isn't enough to beat
Natasha Rossi's 96.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.680
Steffi Navarro will stay in second,
just behind Natasha.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.120
What Steffi achieved in her run
was impressive.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.480
The crowd is obviously for her.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.880
A big effort, an excellent recovery,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.800
in worse conditions than Natasha.

18:46.400 --> 18:52.040
And, well, it adds $9,500 from her score

18:52.120 --> 18:53.920
to save Cielo Grande.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.320
Thanks, Steffi. Thanks, Ron Navarro.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.040
Thanks so much.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.160
Bravo!

19:05.240 --> 19:08.480
Congratulations to the male competitors.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.440
Thanks.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.760
Let's move on to the pro women's category.

19:13.720 --> 19:19.120
The one who will present the awards
is a known international wakeboarder,

19:19.200 --> 19:21.680
winner of this competition years ago.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.880
A big round of applause for Ron Navarro.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.280
Bravo!

19:30.360 --> 19:31.520
Thanks, Augusto.

19:32.440 --> 19:36.000
It's really exciting for me
to be back here at Cielo Grande

19:36.080 --> 19:38.240
and to be able
to participate in the event.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.880
Third place goes to Clara Velayos.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.600
Congratulations.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.320
Thanks so much.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.480
Second place goes to Steffi Navarro.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.360
Cynthia, please, if you could join us.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.640
In the end, I won two prizes.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.720
Congratulations, honey.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.960
Yeah, Steffi!

20:40.800 --> 20:47.520
And first place goes to Natasha Rossi.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.240
-Congratulations, Natasha.
-Thanks.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.480
A big round of applause
for all the competitors, please.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.520
All right, Steffi!

21:07.320 --> 21:10.520
Thanks. We'll see you next year!

21:33.400 --> 21:36.920
Congrats on the award, Natasha.
There's a party at Sky Vibes. Coming?

21:37.680 --> 21:39.320
I'm done here.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.760
What a shame you only care about winning.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.720
On this trip, I learned
what matters most is the experience.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.000
I already learned everything
I had to learn before this trip.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.360
That's why I won and you're consoling
yourself with a party.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.400
Not with a party.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.760
I got my family back.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.880
I'm surrounded by old and new friends,

22:02.960 --> 22:05.160
people who love and need me,

22:05.240 --> 22:06.320
like I need them.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.200
For me, Cielo Grande

22:08.840 --> 22:10.800
is much more than a simple trophy.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.920
Good luck on your next conquest, Natasha.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.760
You and I don't play in the same league.

22:24.720 --> 22:29.800
And up next, Save Cielo at Sky Vibes,

22:29.880 --> 22:33.160
<i>an exclusive presented by the Monzo twins.</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:35.200
<i>Stay with us.</i>

22:36.520 --> 22:40.480
<i>I found myself whispering</i>

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
<i>Not understanding</i>

22:42.640 --> 22:44.840
<i>Talking to myself</i>

22:44.920 --> 22:46.840
<i>Lying</i>

22:46.920 --> 22:52.080
<i>We should be together again</i>

22:53.360 --> 22:57.200
<i>While you were talking to me, I saw it</i>

22:57.280 --> 22:59.440
<i>We understood each other</i>

22:59.520 --> 23:01.280
<i>I lied again</i>

23:01.800 --> 23:05.400
<i>A sigh convinced me</i>

23:06.000 --> 23:09.760
<i>I trick myself and go back for you</i>

23:09.840 --> 23:13.680
<i>Trapped, I can't see clearly</i>

23:13.760 --> 23:17.360
<i>Everything's in my head</i>

23:17.880 --> 23:21.960
<i>I can't feel myself when you're around</i>

23:22.040 --> 23:26.160
<i>I can't get out alone</i>

23:26.240 --> 23:28.240
<i>I go over it</i>

23:28.320 --> 23:30.560
<i>I look for positions</i>

23:30.640 --> 23:34.880
<i>I can't find solutions</i>

23:34.960 --> 23:38.880
<i>Trapped, I can't see clearly</i>

23:38.960 --> 23:43.040
<i>Everything's in my head</i>

23:43.120 --> 23:47.400
<i>I can't feel myself when you're around</i>

23:47.480 --> 23:51.440
<i>I can't get out alone</i>

23:51.520 --> 23:53.200
<i>I go over it</i>

23:53.280 --> 23:55.920
<i>I look for positions</i>

23:56.000 --> 24:00.080
<i>I can't find solutions</i>

24:00.160 --> 24:04.120
<i>Trapped, I can't see clearly</i>

24:04.200 --> 24:07.720
<i>Everything's in my head</i>
