WEBVTT

00:07.174 --> 00:08.884
[Robertson] Sooner or later.

00:08.968 --> 00:11.595
What? Sooner or later what?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.681
We all wind up naked
on the slab.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.642
Preferably without
the bullet holes.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.769
You're a ray of sunshine
this morning.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.355
Yeah, the morgue's
the ultimate reality check.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.691
Life is short, and then you die.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.192
First, you get a root canal.

00:25.276 --> 00:26.861
Or get whacked by a pro.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.029
Yeah, yeah, speaking
of root canal,

00:29.113 --> 00:31.073
Bennett and I are meeting
with the guy from the SEC.

00:31.157 --> 00:33.492
Oof. Don't die of boredom.

00:33.576 --> 00:36.036
- I'll do my best. You?
- Pedro Alvarez.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.663
- He gonna give it up?
- That's the deal.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.165
Got his keep-away
status last night.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.084
Lucky boy.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.669
- Later.
- Later.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.601
- Detective.
- Dr. Golliher.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.894
Sorry to interrupt.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.146
No, no. Come in, come in.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.609
Going somewhere?

01:06.692 --> 01:09.320
Retiring, at long last.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.363
Come, sit.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.034
You've been on my mind recently.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.577
Why is that?

01:16.660 --> 01:18.996
The East Hollywood fire.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.498
A child lost.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.208
Ten-year-old girl.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.084
The Little Tamale Girl.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.837
Her name is Sonia Hernandez.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.216
Two years younger
than Arthur Delacroix.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.968
This child wasn't abused.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.429
She was... beloved.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.640
I'm glad of that.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.392
Ask you a question?

01:40.476 --> 01:42.686
- Of course.
- You told me

01:42.770 --> 01:45.272
back then, when we were looking
at Arthur's broken bones...

01:45.356 --> 01:48.067
What that child endured
in his short life...

01:48.150 --> 01:51.153
You said there had
to be a better world somewhere.

01:51.237 --> 01:54.448
Otherwise, you... you couldn't
keep doing your job.

01:55.491 --> 01:58.118
Yes. Exactly right.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.541
Still believe?
In a better world?

02:05.793 --> 02:09.255
I'm afraid I'm experiencing
a full-blown crisis of faith.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.634
A cancer of the soul.

02:14.677 --> 02:17.388
I know the feeling.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.892
You told me back then
that you believed,

02:21.976 --> 02:23.352
if not in a better world,

02:23.435 --> 02:26.313
at least in the possibility
of justice in this one.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.816
I remember.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.818
Do you still?

02:33.195 --> 02:35.364
Believe in the possibility
of justice?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.449
In this world.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.785
For Sonia Hernandez.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.040
Jury's still out.

Honey Chandler tease.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.068
Said her client

03:54.151 --> 03:56.195
could deliver a whale
in exchange for help

03:56.278 --> 03:57.655
with his current legal troubles.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.657
Her client Vincent Franzen?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.034
They were due to come in and
give a preliminary statement,

04:02.117 --> 04:04.620
outline what they had,
and then...

04:04.703 --> 04:07.081
Someone shot them?

04:07.164 --> 04:09.124
What a thing. Terrible.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.710
I'm lighting a candle
for her recovery.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.507
Uh, what did Franzen have?
Who's the whale?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.175
Carl Rogers.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.219
Carl Rogers.
The hedge fund billionaire?

04:20.302 --> 04:22.721
Mm-hmm. Believe so, yes.

04:22.805 --> 04:25.057
And Franzen was alleging...?

04:25.140 --> 04:28.644
According to Chandler's notes,
massive financial fraud.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.229
So, when Franzen was killed

04:30.312 --> 04:32.648
the night before he was
to give his deposition...

04:32.731 --> 04:35.317
And his lawyer shot
the morning of...

04:35.401 --> 04:37.027
Here we are.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.737
You sure they're connected?

04:38.821 --> 04:42.032
Mr. DeVore, there is such
a thing as coincidence.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.200
Yes?

04:43.325 --> 04:45.035
This ain't it.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.790
[distant siren wailing]

04:52.543 --> 04:53.877
I feel for the kid.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.713
Got his heart set
on West Bureau.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.633
Well, Pierce has the
experience, but Vega's got rank.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.760
Who knows
if there's even a spot?

05:01.844 --> 05:03.554
Well, why wouldn't there be?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.181
I mean, once you and I transfer.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.225
If we transfer.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.519
You thinking
about going somewhere else?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.604
Nothing's carved in stone.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.068
[indistinct chatter]

05:24.700 --> 05:27.661
Hey. LAPD. Detectives
Bosch and Edgar here

05:27.745 --> 05:29.705
to interview an inmate.
Pedro Alvarez.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.712
Nope.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.173
What do you mean, "nope"?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.966
As in, we don't have him nope.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.634
Look again.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.055
[sighs]

05:47.097 --> 05:50.434
Transferred to federal custody
last night.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.896
Say where?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.439
Nope.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.857
Unbelievable.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.150
Don't believe me?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.235
Get yourself a copy
of the removal order

06:00.319 --> 06:02.321
over at Records and Detainers.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.706
They don't look that happy.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.458
Downright glum.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.251
What'd you get from the SEC?

06:16.335 --> 06:18.003
Carl Rogers' hedge fund,

06:18.087 --> 06:20.798
$20 billion in assets
under management.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.842
Rumors of offshore shenanigans
and financial malfeasance,

06:23.926 --> 06:25.761
but nothing indictable.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.679
We have a meeting
with Rogers in the morning.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.848
- How'd it go at county?
- [Bosch] Didn't.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.558
- Alvarez wasn't there.
- Feds have him.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.726
FBI scooped him up last night.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.229
What the fuck? Why?

06:35.312 --> 06:36.605
Who knows?

06:36.688 --> 06:37.940
Where is he now?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.358
No idea.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.697
Harvey. Come in.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.951
Dennis. Wanted to update
you and Lieutenant Billets

06:49.034 --> 06:50.285
on the officer threat
investigation.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.122
More of a prank than a threat

06:53.205 --> 06:55.082
in my opinion.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.334
Well, be that as it may,
her hair's on fire.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.336
Mm.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.380
Let's get it over with.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.176
[phone ringing]

07:07.886 --> 07:09.221
Bosch.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.306
[Anderson] Detective Bosch,
Scott Anderson.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.475
You know I can't comment on
an investigation. Call the PIO.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.519
I'm not calling
about Honey Chandler.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.146
I don't care what
you're calling about.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.815
The Little Tamale Girl--
any progress?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.693
Fucking vulture.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.194
- Scott Anderson?
- Yeah.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.196
About Chandler?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.739
Sonia Hernandez.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.075
Wasn't about to tell him
our key witness is MIA.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.493
[Pounds] We tracked
the photoshop

07:31.577 --> 07:33.078
to an anonymous message board.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.955
Unfortunately, we're unable

07:35.038 --> 07:37.124
to determine the identity
of the person who posted it.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.043
There's no proof at all it's
someone within the division.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.964
Take a look at these.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.597
Officers Norris and Leonard.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.267
The knuckleheads who failed to
back up their female colleagues.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.352
Read the highlighted bits.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.105
"Warpigs"?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.566
These guys are incels.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.527
Involuntary celibates.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.905
Sexually repressed
male supremacists.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.073
It's like the kid in Santa
Barbara who couldn't get laid.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.576
And the other one in Montreal
who shot up McGill.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.286
I know what incels are.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.665
I'm shocked and dismayed
they're in my command.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.959
Not just.
All through the department.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.711
It's an infestation.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.713
Okay, let's not inflate
the problem, Lieutenant.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.089
It's a few bad apples.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.342
[Cooper] Grace,

08:28.425 --> 08:31.094
I want you to know that we
take this absolutely seriously.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.722
And I second that.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.812
Buenos dias, Juan.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.357
Surveillance video?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.525
Just back from goosing
the security company.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.402
- Waiting on more footage.
- Keep pressing.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.383
Fuck you, Bosch.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.269
That was a nice one, Harry.
World-class klong.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.020
What is a klong?

09:22.104 --> 09:24.439
A sudden rush
of shit to the heart.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.984
Mission accomplished.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.068
Yeah.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.697
I was at Metro earlier today.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.782
Following on the mayor's edict.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.453
I know you're eager to make
a name for yourself, Nestor,

09:38.537 --> 09:40.205
but you're late to the party.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.708
We've been working on this issue
since before Lopez was mayor.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.543
Then why is it still going on?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.545
Reform takes time.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.132
Intentionally mislabeling Black
and brown youth as gang members.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.385
Intent is hard to prove, and
the gangs are still a problem,

09:53.468 --> 09:54.845
despite decades of effort.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.513
Gang labeling
follows these kids.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.140
It ruins their lives.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.225
And we're putting a stop to it.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.519
The officers involved
will be disciplined

10:02.602 --> 10:03.645
and practices changed.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.147
When?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.861
As I said, it takes time.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.614
[sighs]

10:14.698 --> 10:16.491
The commission needs
to see real progress

10:16.575 --> 10:18.827
before we vote
on your second term.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.790
[door opens, closes]

10:23.874 --> 10:26.084
[sighs heavily]

10:26.168 --> 10:29.671
[Poole] Okay, Franzen
and his girlfriend were shot

10:29.755 --> 10:32.424
with one nine millimeter pistol,

10:32.507 --> 10:35.594
Honey Chandler with another.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.929
No surprise.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.058
If I had the guns, I could
tell you which was which.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.726
Down the nearest storm drain.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.604
- Gun for hire.
- Paladin.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.066
Have Gun - Will Travel?

10:51.026 --> 10:52.444
Richard Boone?

10:52.527 --> 10:54.112
Yeah, I was gonna say,

10:54.196 --> 10:57.282
if he's a pro,
we cast a nationwide net,

10:57.366 --> 10:59.284
maybe pick up a pattern,
a signature.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.203
Worth a shot.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.747
I'll write it up,
shoot it to ViCAP.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.083
- Thanks, Lester.
- Anytime.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.462
- Paladin?
- Am I dating myself?

11:12.631 --> 11:14.966
[Pierce] Driver's
just sitting there.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.802
[Vega] Nissan Altima.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.011
Sure?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.888
Just like mine.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.431
All look the same.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.975
How long has he been there?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.394
Hours.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.604
What's he waiting for?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.606
Listening to the neighborhood.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.691
Sniffing the air.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.694
He won't move
until it feels right.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.696
[Vega] Here we go.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.242
- [Pierce] What's on his face?
- Distortion mask.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.744
Fucks with
facial recognition software.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.832
Came across 'em
when I was in Robbery.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.875
Scan forward.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.422
There.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.426
[Pierce] What's that
under his arm?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.511
Looks like a laptop.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.432
[Pierce] Shit.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.267
Can't read the plates.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.102
We need more video.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.688
Nothing happened.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.106
What nothing happened?

12:11.189 --> 12:12.566
Pounds overreacted.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.568
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.361
This isn't about Pounds?

12:16.445 --> 12:18.113
What happened with Pounds?

12:18.196 --> 12:20.282
Nothing. Harry was
just fooling around...

12:20.365 --> 12:21.408
No, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.243
- Okay.
- Is there anybody at Pacific

12:23.326 --> 12:25.704
that I can talk to
about Leonard and Norris?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.582
Well, uh...

12:28.665 --> 12:30.292
we both know one.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.085
Ex-Hollywood.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.172
Nope. Drawing a blank.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.007
Female?

12:37.090 --> 12:40.635
You transferred her,
put her on a bike on the beach.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.306
- Oh.
- Oh.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.225
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.734
Not at liberty to discuss.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.903
- You signed it.
- I did.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.071
At whose request?

13:00.155 --> 13:02.741
- FBI. It's on the order.
- Okay.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.367
Who do I talk to?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.620
Sorry. Ongoing investigation.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.706
Yeah, well, we have an ongoing
investigation of our own.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.166
Pedro Alvarez is
a primary suspect

13:11.249 --> 13:13.084
in the East Hollywood
apartment building fire.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.378
- Not familiar with the details.
- Look, we just need

13:15.462 --> 13:17.672
- half an hour with him.
- Not possible at this time.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.424
Where are you holding him?

13:19.508 --> 13:21.718
Again, not at liberty to say.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.595
He was about to flip
and give up Mickey Peña.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.264
- I don't know who that is.
- The hell you don't.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.061
We'd like to speak
with your boss.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.189
- The U.S. Attorney?
- That's right.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.857
He initiated the order.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.276
And I'd like him to explain why.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.615
[phone dings]

14:25.865 --> 14:27.784
Right back.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.085
Did you orchestrate this?

14:37.168 --> 14:39.838
Tell Lopez...

14:39.921 --> 14:43.466
the FBI may have dropped
their investigation,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.385
but I won't.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.935
[car door closes]

14:59.482 --> 15:01.484

[indistinct chatter]

15:42.776 --> 15:44.486
Look who it is.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.321
El Bolillo.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.081
Detective.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.582
¿Qué onda?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.878
Had a long chat
with your homeboy today.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.673
Got lots of homeboys.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.091
Pedro Alvarez.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.677
Zorro. How's he making it?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.720
He's good.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.597
eMe can't get to him.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.432
Makes him downright loquacious.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.017
- "Lo" what?
- "Quacious."

16:16.101 --> 16:17.310
Talkative.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.770
He told us you gave

16:18.853 --> 16:21.898
him and Trejo the order
to firebomb that building.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.358
[Peña] I ain't tell Zorro shit.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.985
Zorro's weak.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.153
He'll tell you
what you want to hear.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.155
- He'll testify to it.
- Testify?

16:30.365 --> 16:31.783
[chuckles] He'll testify to it.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.327
Holy shit. Cojones.
You heard that?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.955
In that case, yeah,
you got me, dawg.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.123
Slap 'em on.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.334
- Garcia, call my lawyer.
- [chuckles]

16:41.418 --> 16:43.378
Not yet, but soon.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.674
Alvarez gave you up, homes.
Trejo will, too.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.218
Trey Trey won't deal.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.095
Zorro won't, either.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.722
End of the day, he'll come home.

16:53.805 --> 16:54.931
You can't get to him.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.099
He's out of reach.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.809
Never say never, amigo.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.602
He ain't in county.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.396
Feds have him.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.608
You got the wrong
Chicano, cabrón.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.026
Fuck off.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.135
- All good?
- All good.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.970
- You rattle him?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.139
I'll tell you one thing,

17:36.222 --> 17:38.141
I think he already knew.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.311
- About Alvarez and the Feds?
- About Alvarez and the Feds.

Okay, I know I'm hopeless,

18:48.336 --> 18:50.338
but you are, like,
a million miles away.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.299
Sorry.

[sighs]

18:56.135 --> 18:57.637
Delgado.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.723
Ambushed me today
about gang labeling.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.934
And what galls me,

19:03.017 --> 19:05.103
he doesn't give a damn
about Black and brown youth.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.188
He wants your job, always has.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.274
He doesn't know
what he doesn't know.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.484
The job will eat him alive.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.986
[doorbell rings]

19:13.069 --> 19:14.404
I'll get it.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.489
Mm-hmm. I'll check on dinner.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.578
Bosch.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.997
Feds have Alvarez.
Took him last night,

19:24.080 --> 19:25.748
right after his
keep-away status came through.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.333
Well, where are they
holding him?

19:27.417 --> 19:29.168
Wouldn't tell me.
"Ongoing investigation."

19:29.252 --> 19:31.296
- Who signed the order?
- Zhang.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.090
We went to her office,
complete stonewall.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.134
And I'm just now
hearing about it?

19:36.217 --> 19:37.927
Alvarez is ready to talk.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.262
I don't care
who's babysitting him.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.722
We just need the interview.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.890
I thought they might
give me access.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.308
I asked Zhang for a meeting

19:43.391 --> 19:45.018
- with the U.S. Attorney.
- No, she'll slow-walk it.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.519
What I'm afraid of.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.104
And now you need my help.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.981
Yes, sir.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.692
[sighs]

19:55.069 --> 19:57.488
Franzen was an investor.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.908
A voice on the phone.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.619
If I spoke to him more
than once, I don't recall.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.746
You never met him?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.748
Maybe.
Someone's holiday party once?

20:06.831 --> 20:08.249
[chuckles] Who knows?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.751
That's it?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.669
The alpha and the omega.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.589
Oh, I trust you don't mind,
I asked my lawyer to join us.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.174
It's been a minute, Detectives.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.842
J. Reason Fowkkes.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.344
You've met.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.762
We've tangled.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.139
Oh, I'd, uh, call it a draw.
Wouldn't you?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.516
If you consider a manslaughter
plea and 15-to-20 a draw.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.312
We were just talking
about Vincent Franzen.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.647
Cheap grifter.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.023
A bottom-feeder.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.733
And he got what he deserved?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.693
Well, he got his tit
caught in a wringer,

20:35.777 --> 20:38.821
concocted some outlandish tale
in order to save his own ass.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.991
If he made it all up,
why'd somebody take him out?

20:42.075 --> 20:44.619
One of his disgruntled investors
would be my guess.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.580
- And Honey Chandler, too?
- Well, when you
lie down with dogs...

20:47.664 --> 20:50.541
Any idea why he'd bring up
your name with the SEC?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.836
Mr. Franzen was in
a desperate situation.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.172
Desperate men make
desperate allegations.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.549
I was looking forward to laying
these baseless accusations

20:58.633 --> 21:00.551
to rest in court.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.888
Now that he's no longer around
to back them up, uh...

21:05.056 --> 21:06.891
We have a witness who can.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.647
Your witness is mistaken.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.613
Harry, I'm sorry.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.615
Fowkkes just pissed me off.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.159
So fucking smug.

21:25.243 --> 21:28.454
Maddie's in the crosshairs now,
thanks to you.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.498
What the fuck?!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.973
[quiet chatter]

22:01.320 --> 22:03.322
[phone ringing]

22:07.618 --> 22:09.746
[ringing continues]

22:12.915 --> 22:14.417
Hi, Dad.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.960
Mads, where are you?

22:16.044 --> 22:18.713
Farmers Market. Du-par's.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.716
What are you doing there?

22:21.799 --> 22:23.760
- Waiting on Antonio.
- [Bosch] I need you
to head home.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.678
Do it now.
Have Antonio meet you there.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.096
I'm putting a car on the house

22:27.180 --> 22:28.222
till I get home.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.599
What's going on?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.684
I'll explain later.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.937
Okay.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.148
I need you to text
or call me every hour.

22:37.231 --> 22:39.442
Now you're scaring me.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.361
Promise.
Every hour on the hour.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
Promise.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.915
[quiet chatter]

22:58.503 --> 23:00.797
That's great. Thanks.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.177
Morgan recovered video
of a dark gray Nissan Altima

23:06.260 --> 23:09.263
in Beachwood Canyon, just south
of the scene, night of.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.307
Tell me we got plates.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.436
Rented to a George McClellan at
Long Beach Airport that morning.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.563
Due back yesterday. No-show.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.440
- I'll run it through ALPERS.
- [sighs]

23:19.524 --> 23:20.858
Ah, the glamor and the glory

23:20.942 --> 23:22.276
of being a detective,
huh, Pierce?

23:22.360 --> 23:25.363
- Livin' the dream.
- Right. The drudgery.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.699
The paperwork, the shoe leather,
the mind-numbing boredom.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.827
Don't bullshit me.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.453
You love it as much as I do.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.247
Not all of it.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.628
I dealt with some sexist shit
in Hollywood, for sure,

23:40.711 --> 23:44.090
but Norris was off the charts.
Leonard, too.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.926
Guys who'd vandalize a female
lieutenant's personal ride?

23:47.009 --> 23:50.096
Oh. [scoffs] You kidding?
They'd get off on it.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.266
All right. So, give me
a "for instance."

23:53.349 --> 23:55.935
Something really egregious.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.980
[scoffs]
Where to start? Uh...

23:59.063 --> 24:01.649
Oh, let's see. All right.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.359
So my partner Claire
and I responded

24:03.442 --> 24:04.944
to "shots fired" in Oakwood.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.071
We get there, situation's
already gone to shit.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.073
Black/Hispanic gang beef.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.908
Put out a help call,
everyone rolled,

24:10.992 --> 24:13.286
- except Norris and Leonard.
- Hmm.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.829
Friend of mine
called them on it.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.038
And what'd they say?

24:16.122 --> 24:17.748
Said they'd be damned
if they'd roll out

24:17.832 --> 24:19.167
for "that fucking tuna boat."

24:19.250 --> 24:22.545
Jesus. Did you report it?

24:22.628 --> 24:23.713
Yeah. It went all the way up

24:23.796 --> 24:25.131
through Pacific's
chain of command.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.593
- And?
- Captain punted, made a deal.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.053
Norris and Leonard agreed
to transfer to avoid

24:31.137 --> 24:33.806
a 128. Just made 'em
someone else's fucking problem.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.475
Yeah. Mine.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.443
Hey, where you two going?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.528
ViCAP flagged a couple of cases.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.697
Miami and Vegas.
Possible pro hits.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.574
- No shit?
- Same M.O.

24:51.657 --> 24:52.658
Double taps to the heart.

24:52.742 --> 24:53.826
[Robertson] Close range,
medium caliber.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.077
Nobody heard nothing.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.370
The whole shmear.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.164
Both vics had O.C. jackets.
