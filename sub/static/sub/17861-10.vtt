WEBVTT

00:01.814 --> 00:03.532
George is on
the precipice of a folly.

00:03.629 --> 00:05.307
A gold-digger?

00:05.309 --> 00:10.467
Oh, go to the house. Do whatever
you can to break this woman's hold.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.107
You wouldn't be offended
if I went to the city, would you?

00:14.109 --> 00:17.067
Why Andrew? You've shown
no interest so far. Why now?

00:17.069 --> 00:18.547
Where are you going?

00:18.549 --> 00:21.627
Promise me that, no matter
what you hear, that you trust me.

00:21.629 --> 00:23.467
Well, there's a trade delegation
coming through.

00:23.469 --> 00:24.987
You'd like me to play host.

00:24.989 --> 00:26.707
The Japanese are no longer
our enemies.

00:26.709 --> 00:28.827
Try telling that
to the people at Inverness.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.347
I saw what the war did to you.

00:32.348 --> 00:35.227
You go home
and you grieve your friend

00:35.229 --> 00:37.547
like the man you are now,

00:37.549 --> 00:39.509
not the man I saved you from.

00:40.829 --> 00:42.947
I should introduce myself.
Sarah Adams.

00:42.949 --> 00:44.907
Ah, yes.

00:44.909 --> 00:46.349
The Jew.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.473 --> 01:10.551
It's OK.

01:10.553 --> 01:14.473
It's only once a year.
You'll be fine.

01:16.673 --> 01:19.351
I'm gonna show Livvy how we do
Guy Fawkes Night Down Under.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.998
Want to come?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.998
I'm happy to get stuck into this.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.758
Bring me back a toffee apple.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.118
Sweet tooth.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.880
Enjoy your evening.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.678
Last chance.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.958
I'll stay and keep
your father company.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.318
He has Leon Uris.
His book.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.360
Go. Show your lovely wife off.
I'm happy here.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.878
I'm offended.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.918
Tales of men in battle

01:57.920 --> 02:00.160
win out over my feminine charms?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.438
I thought you'd be joining James.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.318
You've seen one bonfire night,

02:05.320 --> 02:06.998
you've seen them all.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.080
And it was a chance for us
to have a private chat.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.478
Sarah Adams, who is she?

02:17.480 --> 02:19.758
She works at the hospital.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.878
I know, but... I don't mean to pry.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.198
Might she be
holding a torch for you?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.358
What makes you think that?

02:27.360 --> 02:31.358
Everyone at the hospital
has been so pleasant,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.280
but she was rather brusque.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.920
I know the evil eye when I see it,
and I'm not prone to paranoia.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.280
Excuse me.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.758
Ash Park.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.560
It is, Mildred.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.638
Put him through.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.638
Sir Henry.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.438
Not at all. Any time.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.520
How can I help you?

03:12.640 --> 03:15.198
I'd like to keep Elizabeth in
for a couple more days.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.638
She's gonna be fine, but the longer
she stays in, the better.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.558
Stress is the enemy.
I'm sure.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.318
I didn't invite you here

03:23.320 --> 03:24.878
to talk about Mother.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.358
There's nothing I can get you?

03:26.360 --> 03:29.000
No, I'm right.
Sit, please.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.798
Nearly Armistice Day.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.318
The year's raced by.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.720
Yeah.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.598
I'll spit it out.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.278
I'm going to ask a favour.
A big one.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.920
And I imagine you'll
find it hard to say yes.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.400
OK.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.998
Yesterday's enemies
are today's friends, Jack,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.160
for political... economic reasons.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.598
A Japanese trade delegation
are coming here on Monday,

04:02.600 --> 04:06.678
and I've been asked to play host, to
meet and greet, to tour the district.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.118
And what's that got to do with me?

04:09.120 --> 04:11.718
It's just before Poppy Day.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.198
And the timing stinks.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.077
Everyone knows that you have more
reason to hold a grudge than any local,

04:18.079 --> 04:23.358
so your involvement would go a long
way to silencing the 'anti' sentiment.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.598
I know I'm asking a lot.
You have no bloody idea, George!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.960
Jack...
Forget me. They killed your wife.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.478
Yes, they did.
And you're gonna shake their hands?!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.958
The war's eight years done, Jack.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.278
The men whose hands I shake
didn't drop those bombs...

04:37.280 --> 04:38.998
No, they were part of it!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.078
We need to find a way ahead.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.838
Yeah? Well, you can
do that without me.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.918
I knew this would be hard
for you but...

04:44.920 --> 04:47.080
Shove it up your arse, George!

04:48.480 --> 04:52.038
I'm sorry, if you want to lick
their boots for a few bales of wool,

04:52.040 --> 04:53.880
you do it on your own.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.358
Jack.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.880
Jack!

05:14.520 --> 05:16.240
I'm not to be disturbed,
for any reason.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.880
George?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.160
I gather it went badly.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.880
It did.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.160
Well, you have all my support.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.078
With Elizabeth in hospital,
I'm happy to play hostess.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.478
I couldn't ask you to...
I want to help.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.240
In any way I can.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.358
You couldn't have timed
being here more perfectly.

06:25.360 --> 06:30.000
I couldn't, could I?
No.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.398
I saw it and I said to myself,

06:57.400 --> 07:01.318
"What better way to cheer up
my mooching niece?"

07:01.320 --> 07:03.558
You like?
It's nice.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.638
Nice?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.678
It's lovely.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.440
It's yours.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.520
Thank you.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.598
Now you need somewhere to wear it.
I'm happy here.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.718
You've sat around with
that long face for days.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.398
Come on, why?

07:21.400 --> 07:25.118
Why what?
This sudden visit.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.998
I told you...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.078
It's more than wanting
to get away from Regina.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.558
Although I wouldn't blame you
if you did -

07:30.560 --> 07:32.518
she is a bitch in sheep's clothing.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.078
Yeah, well,
Father seems to like her.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.718
He's just blinded by
her similarity to your mother.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.918
Come on, truth.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.438
Is it Gino? Have you argued?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.200
I don't want to talk about it.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.758
Got to be better than burying
your head in 'Forever Amber'.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.360
You like those banned books.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.760
At least they're honest about things.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.280
About sex?

08:00.240 --> 08:02.118
You're never told anything.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.960
You're just told all the things
that you can't do.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.758
And then you're supposed to
make it up as you go along.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.960
And if you get it wrong...
if it just all goes wrong...

08:21.960 --> 08:23.680
You're not.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.920
I went to the doctor
the day that I arrived.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.600
And I'm waiting on
the test results.

09:32.429 --> 09:35.187
I'd better get moving.

09:35.243 --> 09:38.681
This reception won't organise itself.
Good luck.

09:38.683 --> 09:40.843
I might need it
without Jack's backing.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.843
I'm glad I've got Regina to help.

09:49.123 --> 09:53.123
Um, before you go...
Mmm?

09:54.483 --> 09:55.963
Regina.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.881
I don't understand
George's fascination.

10:00.883 --> 10:03.521
The woman's hardly a beauty.

10:03.523 --> 10:06.601
Oh, it's her strength
he admires, I suspect.

10:06.603 --> 10:08.401
Positively Oedipal.

10:08.403 --> 10:11.721
You're the only other strong woman
in his life.

10:11.723 --> 10:14.881
There the resemblance ends.

10:14.883 --> 10:18.361
I should hope so. Oy vey.

10:18.363 --> 10:23.161
Might be wise to avoid that type
of expression with George.

10:23.163 --> 10:26.003
I adjust my opinion
to suit my audience.

10:27.763 --> 10:29.923
You really do dislike them,
don't you?

10:31.403 --> 10:33.363
After what I saw in Jerusalem?

10:34.603 --> 10:37.481
I'm not as forgiving as George.

10:37.483 --> 10:40.361
He's about to kowtow to the Japs.

10:40.363 --> 10:45.841
So the way that she said
the word 'Jew', that's it?

10:45.843 --> 10:48.001
Yes.

10:48.003 --> 10:51.521
Are you sure you're not
being overly sensitive?

10:51.523 --> 10:53.481
She almost spat the word.

10:53.483 --> 10:56.321
There seems to be
some kind of misunderstanding.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.761
She thinks that...
you were rude to her.

10:59.763 --> 11:01.881
I simply bumped into her
and introduced myself

11:01.883 --> 11:04.001
and got, "Ah, the Jew,"
for my pains.

11:04.003 --> 11:05.601
I was nothing but civil.

11:05.603 --> 11:10.403
And we passed each other on
the way here - if looks could kill.

11:13.523 --> 11:16.721
There might be
one possible explanation.

11:16.723 --> 11:21.161
Her husband was part of
the British protectorate in '46

11:21.163 --> 11:25.121
and they were in the Hotel David
when it was bombed.

11:25.123 --> 11:27.161
In Jerusalem?
Mm-hm.

11:27.163 --> 11:31.161
A number of her friends were killed.
I see.

11:31.163 --> 11:34.961
A Zionist bomb. I'll speak with her.
No.

11:34.963 --> 11:38.043
No, look, if it is a problem,
it's mine.

11:39.483 --> 11:41.803
Give her another chance? Hmm?

11:45.243 --> 11:48.203
I thought I said not to...

11:50.323 --> 11:51.443
You heard.

11:52.906 --> 11:53.904
Yes.

11:53.906 --> 11:56.304
Your ticker doesn't need
to get mixed up in this.

11:56.306 --> 12:00.626
No, it doesn't.
Explain how this is helping.

12:02.466 --> 12:05.344
It reminds me of who I'd be betraying
if I said yes.

12:05.346 --> 12:06.984
Bill Gregory.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.864
And every mate I saw suffer
at their hands.

12:09.866 --> 12:11.584
Go back to bed.

12:11.586 --> 12:14.144
George should never have asked you.

12:14.146 --> 12:16.586
Probably, but he did.

12:18.546 --> 12:24.744
Jack, whatever you think
you owe us... you don't owe us this.

12:24.746 --> 12:27.624
Even if my refusal
makes it tougher for him?

12:27.626 --> 12:32.506
Oh. Some things come before family.

12:35.506 --> 12:38.226
But there is one thing
I insist on in return.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.226
That stays untouched.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.386
Take it.

12:51.106 --> 12:52.584
Good.

12:52.586 --> 12:55.984
To protect you from the stress
of worrying, not me from myself.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.464
I'm OK.

12:57.466 --> 12:59.384
Hmm.

12:59.386 --> 13:01.786
Even better.

13:14.386 --> 13:17.306
You have to eat something.
I'm not hungry.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.226
One for one?

13:25.586 --> 13:29.866
Good girl. Time enough to worry when
you get the results, IF you have to.

13:31.026 --> 13:34.944
I have this... feeling.
Which might be wrong.

13:34.946 --> 13:37.664
If I am, will you...

13:37.666 --> 13:40.304
We're not even going to discuss things
like that until you know for sure.

13:40.306 --> 13:42.986
But you will help me, won't you?

13:44.386 --> 13:46.426
With anything except an abortion.

13:48.186 --> 13:51.504
But no-one would have to know.
I would.

13:51.506 --> 13:54.546
Even black sheep have their limits.

13:57.466 --> 14:00.746
It's not the morals or the ethics.

14:01.946 --> 14:04.384
God forbid, it's not even the danger.
What then?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.386
Tell me.

14:09.386 --> 14:13.546
If you are pregnant, perhaps.
It's very complicated.

14:15.066 --> 14:18.106
Tea and toast may be enough for you
but I am famished.

14:23.106 --> 14:26.786
It's like listening
to a secret world.

14:28.546 --> 14:30.664
A little girl.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.146
What?

14:33.226 --> 14:38.264
That is the first time you've even
suggested it might be a girl.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.746
Really?

14:42.586 --> 14:48.704
I think it's easier to think of
soft and pink and little girl things

14:48.706 --> 14:50.986
when you're happier.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.384
Just my silly theory.

14:54.386 --> 14:56.226
It's not so silly.

14:58.346 --> 14:59.866
I am happy.

15:01.866 --> 15:03.346
We are.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.226
I want a little copy of you.

15:12.826 --> 15:14.544
I love you.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.226
I love you.

15:27.586 --> 15:28.626
Jack.

15:29.866 --> 15:31.666
George.

15:35.346 --> 15:36.866
Bloody Jap-lover.

15:49.586 --> 15:52.584
Ah, you're here. Good.
We need to talk.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.224
What's wrong?

15:54.226 --> 15:58.224
I've just got a serve from Bert Ford.
About the visit?

15:58.226 --> 16:00.224
Regina told me.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.224
He might be the first
but he won't be the last.

16:03.226 --> 16:06.224
For everyone who doesn't understand,
there will be others who do.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.384
We need to look to the future.

16:08.386 --> 16:11.144
You're preaching to the converted...
It's not just for trade.

16:11.146 --> 16:13.304
We need Japan as a buffer
against China.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.904
I am fully aware
of the practicalities.

16:15.906 --> 16:18.504
Now, Jack...

16:18.506 --> 16:21.864
Look, I understand
why you were asking him

16:21.866 --> 16:24.904
and I can understand
why you might try to do it again,

16:24.906 --> 16:26.946
but don't, please.

16:28.266 --> 16:29.864
He's the one man in this town...

16:29.866 --> 16:31.424
Yes, his seal of approval

16:31.426 --> 16:33.544
could silence a lot of
the critics, of course.

16:33.546 --> 16:36.224
But a man who's been through
what he has

16:36.226 --> 16:39.786
needs to find forgiveness
in his own heart in his own time.

16:41.426 --> 16:43.384
Do you think
this is easy for me?

16:43.386 --> 16:46.704
Oh, George, of course I don't.
Of course not.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.624
But Jack survived
unmentionable horrors for years,

16:50.626 --> 16:54.304
and every one of them
had a Japanese face on it.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.906
Let him be.

17:01.506 --> 17:02.984
I'll give it a go.

17:02.986 --> 17:04.665
Jack...
It's OK.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.906
Can't guarantee I'll pull it off.

17:10.786 --> 17:13.104
Thank you.
It's what you have to do, I know.

17:13.106 --> 17:16.104
I'm not gonna let the likes
of Bert Ford use it against you.

17:16.106 --> 17:19.425
Now, the minute it gets too hard...
I'll bail out, trust me.

17:21.346 --> 17:23.786
Given what I owe you both,
I have to try.

17:34.426 --> 17:36.106
You watch him.

17:52.306 --> 17:54.024
Well, come on in.

17:54.026 --> 17:55.986
Missy, it's for you.

17:56.986 --> 17:59.024
I'm guessing it's not me
you're after.

17:59.026 --> 18:00.944
Partly.

18:00.946 --> 18:03.546
I'm going to the reception
for the Japs.

18:04.826 --> 18:06.426
Spread the word at the pub?

18:07.386 --> 18:09.064
And tell Bert Ford and his mates

18:09.066 --> 18:11.544
that if a man who suffered by them
can accept it,

18:11.546 --> 18:13.744
them as never put on a uniform can.

18:13.746 --> 18:15.584
Good man.

18:15.586 --> 18:17.584
Was there talk there tonight?

18:17.586 --> 18:19.424
There was.

18:19.426 --> 18:22.106
Yeah, well, I hope
this might shut it down.

18:24.026 --> 18:25.546
A moment alone?

18:27.946 --> 18:31.304
Right. I'll leave youse to it.
Goodnight.

18:31.306 --> 18:33.506
You want a cup of tea?
Yeah.

18:38.186 --> 18:40.506
Can't have been easy.

18:41.666 --> 18:44.544
We're still burning Guy Fawkes
after 400 years,

18:44.546 --> 18:46.584
but seemingly we're supposed to

18:46.586 --> 18:49.224
forgive and forget the Japs
after eight.

18:49.226 --> 18:50.946
Something inconsistent there.

18:52.266 --> 18:55.346
I need a favour.
Of course.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.066
I can't walk in alone.

18:59.186 --> 19:01.624
I'm not invited.
I'm inviting you.

19:01.626 --> 19:02.704
But it's...

19:02.706 --> 19:06.026
I'm there with you,
or I'm not there at all.

19:07.706 --> 19:10.346
I'm not too proud
to admit I need help.

19:11.506 --> 19:13.066
Then you have it.

19:14.546 --> 19:16.066
Thank you.

19:35.593 --> 19:38.351
So if they need extra hands
at the reception, you will help, yes?

19:38.353 --> 19:40.191
Yes, Mamma.
Good.

19:40.193 --> 19:42.831
If I hear anything, I will tell you.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.351
She'll come back for tomorrow,
I think, yes?

19:45.353 --> 19:47.591
How would I know?

19:47.593 --> 19:49.031
Gino...
Don't.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.671
Perhaps she is starting to see
that this cannot work.

19:52.673 --> 19:53.951
No.

19:53.953 --> 19:56.951
Then why has she suddenly gone
with hardly a word?

19:56.953 --> 19:58.471
She told me to trust her.

19:58.473 --> 20:00.433
And would you be like this
if you did?

20:01.753 --> 20:06.073
I am sorry, caro.
I know what I hope for.

20:07.433 --> 20:10.113
Even if it breaks your heart.

20:11.953 --> 20:13.433
She loves me.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.951
Darling, all very
scandalous, I know,

20:21.953 --> 20:24.151
but the sexual indiscretions
of horrible Henry

20:24.153 --> 20:25.631
don't really interest me.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.953
Andrew Swanson's father.

20:28.953 --> 20:31.631
Oh, that is not a position
I wish to contemplate.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.871
Bad enough thinking about
him on top of her

20:33.873 --> 20:36.471
let alone collapsing on top of her.

20:36.473 --> 20:38.631
Sir Henry took a turn mid-coitus
with his mistress.

20:38.633 --> 20:40.351
The town is abuzz with the scandal.

20:40.353 --> 20:42.271
Really?!

20:42.273 --> 20:43.753
Really?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.751
Really?

20:47.753 --> 20:50.113
You have a problem, my darling.

20:57.553 --> 20:59.833
Ah, good afternoon, Miss.
Come through.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.671
Your call was a pleasant surprise.
I needed diversion.

21:06.673 --> 21:08.511
Thank you for seeing me, Andrew.

21:08.513 --> 21:11.231
So formal.
Has the gossip reached you?

21:11.233 --> 21:14.951
Yes.
The old hypocrite. Serves him right.

21:14.953 --> 21:17.151
Mother too
for turning too blind an eye.

21:17.153 --> 21:20.871
Does that sound too harsh?
No.

21:20.873 --> 21:22.591
So what makes me think
this isn't pleasure?

21:22.593 --> 21:25.471
I won't beat around the bush.
Please don't.

21:25.473 --> 21:29.711
I heard you're going to Ash Park
tomorrow in place of your father.

21:29.713 --> 21:32.311
The jungle drums have been beating.

21:32.313 --> 21:33.591
Are you?

21:33.593 --> 21:35.031
While he lies in St Vincent's,

21:35.033 --> 21:37.591
Mother and I are putting on
the sort of brave front

21:37.593 --> 21:39.031
that's meant to silence gossip.

21:39.033 --> 21:40.271
I see.

21:40.273 --> 21:42.751
It's not the time to be
cancelling engagements.

21:42.753 --> 21:45.551
Will you be there?
No.

21:45.553 --> 21:47.033
What a shame.

21:48.393 --> 21:49.671
So?

21:49.673 --> 21:52.431
My aunt Regina has come
to stay with us.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.511
I wanted to get away from her

21:54.513 --> 21:58.031
so I made the excuse that
I was coming up here to see you.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.673
Ah.

22:00.873 --> 22:02.111
And I was wondering
if you wouldn't...

22:02.113 --> 22:04.393
You want me to lie for you.

22:06.113 --> 22:07.991
Only to save Aunt Reggie's feelings.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.511
So let me get this right -
you lied at home to get away

22:10.513 --> 22:13.031
and now you're lying to me
about why you lied to them,

22:13.033 --> 22:14.753
and I'm supposed to go along with it?

22:17.433 --> 22:20.711
This has nothing to do with
Aunty Reggie now, does it?

22:20.713 --> 22:22.233
Well?

22:23.193 --> 22:26.233
Don't flush so much
if you want to be believed.

22:29.193 --> 22:30.673
Alright.

22:32.073 --> 22:35.471
What?
I will. Keep your secret.

22:35.473 --> 22:38.191
You're somehow more attractive
being so devious.

22:38.193 --> 22:40.471
So you won't say anything?

22:40.473 --> 22:42.991
I will weave
the most marvellous tales

22:42.993 --> 22:45.393
of us having fabulous times together.

22:46.913 --> 22:49.593
And one day I will call in the debt.

22:51.113 --> 22:52.953
You owe me.

22:54.313 --> 22:55.991
What do you mean?

22:55.993 --> 22:57.873
You know.

22:59.353 --> 23:00.873
Now, food.

23:03.193 --> 23:07.433
And I will tell you every grisly
detail of the old fool's shame.

23:23.753 --> 23:27.031
There'll be trouble tomorrow
Jack or no Jack.

23:27.033 --> 23:28.351
Pub talk?

23:28.353 --> 23:31.351
If Bert Ford and his scaly crew
get their way,

23:31.353 --> 23:33.553
the Japs won't even
make it up the drive.

23:34.753 --> 23:37.193
But it's not your fight.
Isn't it?

23:53.633 --> 23:56.551
It reminds me of
the parties back home.

23:56.553 --> 23:58.391
More flies.

23:58.393 --> 24:01.911
Everything is with
more flies out here.

24:01.913 --> 24:05.391
It's my turn to be proud today.
Why's that?

24:05.393 --> 24:08.153
Mrs. James Bligh.

24:09.593 --> 24:12.591
You think you can be proud of me
after... everything?

24:12.593 --> 24:14.673
That's the past.

24:17.273 --> 24:18.991
Thank you.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.873
I'd better get ready.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.191
Is that Mrs. Bligh?

24:33.193 --> 24:34.673
Yep.

24:39.553 --> 24:43.191
Beauty is so wasted
on the lower classes.

24:43.193 --> 24:45.271
Who is he?

24:45.273 --> 24:46.991
I don't know.

24:46.993 --> 24:49.631
He makes me wish
I was 20 years younger

24:49.633 --> 24:51.831
and a few rungs down
the social ladder.

24:51.833 --> 24:56.071
Oh, even the newly
widowed can have a sense of humour.

24:56.073 --> 24:59.111
Have you seen George?
No.

24:59.113 --> 25:01.273
Then I'll keep looking.

25:06.793 --> 25:08.351
There you are.

25:08.353 --> 25:10.271
Dutch courage?

25:10.273 --> 25:12.831
Something to stiffen the resolve.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.873
Can't be easy.

25:16.033 --> 25:17.951
It's harder for some.

25:17.953 --> 25:22.311
Well, you look very handsome
and very distinguished.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.631
I'm sure the Japanese
won't be able to wait

25:24.633 --> 25:26.911
to throw millions of yen
at our wool trade.

25:26.913 --> 25:29.271
You don't think I'm wrong?
Why would I?

25:29.273 --> 25:31.113
Elaine was your sister.

25:32.993 --> 25:35.551
We have to put the past behind us.

25:35.553 --> 25:37.033
We do.

25:38.553 --> 25:40.273
Not just from the Japanese.

25:42.353 --> 25:44.631
I spoke with Sister Adams.

25:44.633 --> 25:48.671
She seems to think
you're anti-Semitic.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.671
That's ridiculous.

25:50.673 --> 25:52.951
You must have said something
to give her that idea.

25:52.953 --> 25:54.791
Not that I'm aware of.

25:54.793 --> 25:57.111
Honestly, I know
the Jews have suffered,

25:57.113 --> 25:59.753
but it does make them
overly sensitive.

26:01.633 --> 26:06.031
Oh, dear. That seems to
support her case, doesn't it?

26:06.033 --> 26:09.873
I have overcome things, George.
Trust me.

26:11.313 --> 26:13.831
I'll apologise to the good sister
next time I see her

26:13.833 --> 26:16.991
for whatever slight
she imagines I've offered her.

26:16.993 --> 26:19.431
And I stress - imagines.

26:19.433 --> 26:20.911
Thank you.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.711
You'll have your chance today.
She's coming with Jack.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.191
Is she?
Mmm.

26:25.193 --> 26:26.911
Wonderful.

26:26.913 --> 26:29.913
It'll be an afternoon
for forgiveness all around.

26:30.993 --> 26:32.473
Let's hope so.

26:38.353 --> 26:40.191
You're early.

26:40.193 --> 26:42.793
Yeah, the sooner we're in,
the sooner we can get out.

26:47.993 --> 26:51.911
These will be the first Jap faces
I'll have seen since the camp.

26:51.913 --> 26:53.431
What's your favourite song?

26:53.433 --> 26:55.391
Why?

26:55.393 --> 26:58.471
What is it?
Uh, I'm not really big on music.

26:58.473 --> 27:00.273
You must have one.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.351
'Danny Boy'?

27:04.353 --> 27:08.831
Yeah, Mum used to sing it to me as
a kid, except she'd sing 'Jacky boy'.

27:08.833 --> 27:12.793
OK, in that moment,
when you see them, when it's...

27:16.073 --> 27:18.911
hum it.

27:18.913 --> 27:22.993
The calming power of music -
I've seen it work wonders.

27:30.913 --> 27:32.831
Hey up!

27:32.833 --> 27:35.633
Come on, boys!

27:48.273 --> 27:51.351
You let me through
or do I have to go in swinging?

27:51.353 --> 27:53.991
Hey, mate, he's brought his backup.

27:53.993 --> 27:56.791
You're gonna spit on
your mates' graves, are ya?

27:56.793 --> 27:59.473
I wouldn't take that from
a real man, let alone you.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.191
Look at ya, huh?!

28:02.193 --> 28:05.433
All lining up to help him
do his dirty work.

28:06.553 --> 28:09.271
'Cause this isn't about the Japs,
it's about him and his grudges.

28:09.273 --> 28:12.991
Don't listen to him, boys.
Shut up! I wasn't talking to you!

28:12.993 --> 28:16.673
Now, if there's anyone here
with more reason to hate today...

28:18.033 --> 28:20.191
step forward.

28:20.193 --> 28:21.711
Step forward.

28:21.713 --> 28:25.751
Tell me not to go in there,
I'll turn around now. Huh?

28:25.753 --> 28:28.631
I don't see one man here who served.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.993
So who has the right
to tell me I can't go in there?

28:34.593 --> 28:36.073
That's right.

28:37.873 --> 28:39.553
Now stand aside.

28:41.633 --> 28:44.391
Stand aside.
Don't move.

28:44.393 --> 28:47.311
- Stand aside.
- Oi! Hey, hey, hey.

28:47.313 --> 28:51.031
If I hear of anyone stopping
the Japs getting in,

28:51.033 --> 28:52.431
I'll be down

28:52.433 --> 28:55.391
and I'll show you how much
of my army training I can remember.

28:55.393 --> 28:57.073
Go home.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.711
If I can forget, you can!
You're not serious?

29:00.713 --> 29:03.393
Shut your filthy
wife-beating mouth, Ford!

29:07.473 --> 29:08.991
Come on, mate.
Yeah, mate.

29:08.993 --> 29:11.311
Yeah, mate.
Let's go. Come on. Hey!

29:11.313 --> 29:13.271
Yeah, you'll keep.
Any time.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.753
Let's go.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.513
Don't worry about him.
Nah.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.753
You alright?

29:54.713 --> 29:57.791
Miss Adams.
Thank you, Gino.

29:57.793 --> 30:00.031
Uh, just lemonade, thanks, mate.

30:00.033 --> 30:02.353
You're a hero, you know.

30:03.913 --> 30:05.473
Everyone's saying so.

30:07.913 --> 30:10.513
I just turned up.
Exactly.

30:11.673 --> 30:13.391
Late. Must be on Tokyo time.

30:13.393 --> 30:15.593
Shall we mingle?
Nah, not yet.

30:16.913 --> 30:20.073
Food?
Couldn't keep it down.

30:25.153 --> 30:27.153
Please, be my guest.

30:37.913 --> 30:39.233
Hum.

30:56.273 --> 30:58.273
Jack!

31:10.553 --> 31:12.353
Hey!

31:24.913 --> 31:28.391
Please. Oh, no, no!

31:28.393 --> 31:30.553
Please!

31:33.513 --> 31:35.633
Jack.

31:37.633 --> 31:40.113
# Oh, Jacky boy... #

32:26.305 --> 32:30.223
We look forward to long business
with your father and with you.

32:30.225 --> 32:32.143
As do I, Hiroshi-san.

32:32.145 --> 32:34.065
Domo arigato gozaimasu.

32:35.225 --> 32:38.663
He's full of surprises.
He is, isn't he?

32:38.665 --> 32:42.105
Mr. Hiroshi, there are some guests
I'd like you to meet.

32:45.105 --> 32:47.463
Where did you pick that up?

32:47.465 --> 32:51.263
One of the benefits of having
a well-travelled aunt.

32:51.265 --> 32:53.665
I don't want you
to get cross, but...

32:54.825 --> 32:57.223
there's something about her
I don't like.

32:57.225 --> 33:02.343
Whenever she talks to me, I feel as
if I'm the mouse and she's the cat.

33:02.345 --> 33:04.263
What, you think
she's playing with you?

33:04.265 --> 33:09.663
It's more as if
she's playing being herself.

33:09.665 --> 33:13.343
Years as a diplomat's wife, being
a chameleon in her surroundings,

33:13.345 --> 33:14.945
that's all it is.

33:16.545 --> 33:18.343
James.

33:18.345 --> 33:19.785
I'll be right back.

33:23.145 --> 33:24.943
Gentlemen, my son, James.

33:24.945 --> 33:27.383
Who's that woman
talking to the doctor?

33:27.385 --> 33:28.983
Why do you ask?

33:28.985 --> 33:32.663
George keeps circling back to her
from time to time.

33:32.665 --> 33:34.985
A romance?
Hardly.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.263
A local nurse.
Ah.

33:38.265 --> 33:39.745
A Jew.

33:41.585 --> 33:43.905
Dear me.
Mmm, she converted.

33:45.465 --> 33:47.783
Oh, to be born one is unfortunate.

33:47.785 --> 33:52.185
But to become one?
My dear, positively perverse.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.543
Miss Adams.

33:55.545 --> 33:57.743
He's done well. You've done well.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.663
I think he's reached his limit.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.945
Will you thank him again for me?
Why don't you?

34:03.105 --> 34:05.263
What?
I wish you were on my arm.

34:05.265 --> 34:07.783
I wish I was in your arms.
Later at the cottage?

34:07.785 --> 34:11.183
I should be done here by 5:00.
I'll meet you there at 6:00.

34:11.185 --> 34:13.703
Why don't you tell Jack
I need to powder my nose

34:13.705 --> 34:15.304
and I'll meet him out the front.

34:18.905 --> 34:21.784
Can I borrow him for a moment?
Yes. Yes, certainly.

34:24.185 --> 34:26.065
Sarah said she'll meet you outside.

34:28.105 --> 34:30.025
Thank you for today.

34:31.585 --> 34:34.185
Done my duty?
Above and beyond.

34:35.585 --> 34:37.902
I'd better go before
I run out of goodwill.

34:37.905 --> 34:39.382
Jack.

34:39.385 --> 34:40.945
You're OK?

34:53.225 --> 34:54.703
Sister.

34:54.705 --> 34:58.103
Ah, the Gentile.
Quick.

34:58.105 --> 35:02.143
You ran crying to George, I hear.
I mentioned our meeting.

35:02.145 --> 35:03.623
A wise friend once said,

35:03.625 --> 35:07.583
"They should call it the Whining
Wall, the amount they whine."

35:07.585 --> 35:09.305
That answers one question.

35:10.505 --> 35:13.503
You've done a good job at keeping
that side of yourself from George.

35:13.505 --> 35:16.863
I always choose my audience.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.583
Feel free to scurry to him again.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.663
I'll make sure you end up
seeming paranoid.

35:21.665 --> 35:24.905
I can fight my own battles.
As can I.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.543
That smile takes me
right back to Germany.

35:31.545 --> 35:33.863
And yours me to Jerusalem.

35:33.865 --> 35:37.625
Israel's still there.
Nazi Germany isn't.

35:41.865 --> 35:45.143
I tell you, you should come to the
city. Even Anna's warmed to it.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.943
Really?
Really.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.423
I don't believe you.

35:48.425 --> 35:51.103
We're going to the theatre
next week - 'Dial M for Murder'.

35:51.105 --> 35:52.745
I know she'll love it.

35:54.705 --> 35:59.063
Harry, you can stay
and help us clear away, yes?

35:59.065 --> 36:01.383
I'm not feeling too bright, sorry.

36:01.385 --> 36:04.983
There's food in the kitchen to take,
for little Colin, huh?

36:04.985 --> 36:07.905
Gino, put this on the table.

36:09.025 --> 36:11.343
Wait, I'll get it for you.

36:11.345 --> 36:14.383
I saw her two or three times.
We had a wonderful lunch yesterday.

36:14.385 --> 36:16.103
So you've beaten down
her resistance?

36:16.105 --> 36:20.145
Girls like Anna take patience,
and my patience is being rewarded.

36:27.225 --> 36:28.865
What's wrong?

36:30.625 --> 36:32.225
I was sick again.

36:33.185 --> 36:37.343
Oh, for goodness sake!

36:37.345 --> 36:41.025
You're getting your results
in a few hours. It was just nerves.

36:42.665 --> 36:44.145
I hope so.

36:57.145 --> 36:59.105
Thank you.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.865
Stay for a while.
I'm fine.

37:04.225 --> 37:06.263
Done now.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.745
I'll see you tomorrow, huh?

38:17.933 --> 38:20.291
Miss Bligh, the doctor
will see you now.

38:20.293 --> 38:21.931
I can come in with you.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.253
As long as you're here
when I come out.

38:50.733 --> 38:54.051
- Jack?
- # Oh, Jacky boy

38:54.053 --> 38:58.931
# The pipes, the pipes are calling

38:58.933 --> 39:01.091
# From... #
Jack?

39:01.093 --> 39:02.851
# And down the... #

39:02.853 --> 39:04.573
Are you alright?
Go away.

39:06.013 --> 39:08.291
Come on, come here.

39:08.293 --> 39:10.851
Sit up.
No. Shhh. I don't need your help.

39:10.853 --> 39:14.571
I don't need your help.
I don't need your help. Alright?

39:14.573 --> 39:17.491
What time is it, I've gotta...
What have you done to yourself?

39:17.493 --> 39:19.333
I've gotta get...
What do you... What?

39:20.573 --> 39:23.571
Come on, let's go to Roy's
and you can sleep this off.

39:23.573 --> 39:25.291
No.

39:25.293 --> 39:27.413
Well, you can't stay here.
No!

39:31.853 --> 39:33.773
What kind of man am I?

39:35.653 --> 39:38.931
I shook their bloody hands.
Shhh. Come on now.

39:38.933 --> 39:41.053
What they did to Bill...

39:43.733 --> 39:45.731
he hung himself.

39:45.733 --> 39:48.011
And I shook their blood...
It's over.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.651
I shook their hands.
It's over.

39:49.653 --> 39:53.451
No! No, it's not over! You don't know
what they did in that place.

39:53.453 --> 39:56.493
OK? You don't know. You don't know.

39:58.013 --> 40:01.451
I was in a German camp.
Huh?

40:01.453 --> 40:04.733
Ravensbrck. For two years.

40:06.293 --> 40:08.093
I understand.

40:10.653 --> 40:13.011
And that's why I admire what you did

40:13.013 --> 40:15.013
because I don't know
if I could have.

40:16.853 --> 40:18.653
Hey.

40:22.653 --> 40:25.173
I always knew there was
something with you.

40:35.453 --> 40:37.091
You're a good woman.
Shhh.

40:37.093 --> 40:40.253
Sarah, I know, I know, I know
I love you.

40:41.853 --> 40:43.371
I love you, Sarah.

40:43.373 --> 40:45.211
I always have.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.731
You must know that.

40:47.733 --> 40:50.693
Shhh. Shhh. Shhh.

41:11.293 --> 41:13.091
Oh, my darling.

41:13.093 --> 41:15.653
What am I going to do?

41:25.933 --> 41:27.453
Sarah?

41:28.573 --> 41:30.693
Sorry I'm late. They wouldn't leave.

41:32.493 --> 41:34.013
Sarah?

42:10.733 --> 42:12.973
And that's the last drink
you'll ever take.

42:18.333 --> 42:19.813
Yeah.

42:23.093 --> 42:26.173
I should be better than this.
You are.

42:28.893 --> 42:30.413
What did I say?

42:31.613 --> 42:32.813
You don't remember?

42:34.093 --> 42:36.251
I remember drinking.

42:36.253 --> 42:38.533
And then I woke up and then...

42:40.173 --> 42:42.093
What?
Nothing.

42:43.813 --> 42:46.171
You just sang.
