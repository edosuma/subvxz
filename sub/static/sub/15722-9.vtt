WEBVTT

00:00.418 --> 00:02.731
Homeland Security's been keeping
a close watch

00:02.885 --> 00:05.019
on two brothers. Scientists.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.467
Stefan and Vincent Manford.

00:08.385 --> 00:10.865
David, you got to think these guys
are up to something more

00:10.981 --> 00:12.865
than just sending
wine to the President.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.827
I think I'd like to meet them.

00:15.019 --> 00:17.769
- The yeast is more of a vector.
- A delivery system.

00:17.923 --> 00:21.038
You guys are trying to find
a way to put a vaccine in bread?

00:21.231 --> 00:23.135
That is fucking brilliant.

00:23.366 --> 00:24.860
They missed it, Vincent.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.036
We knew they would, Stefan.

00:28.825 --> 00:30.900
Going back to New York is a good thing.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.735
They'll stick me.
I dumped their dope

00:33.906 --> 00:36.320
and that shit is worth, like,
half a million bucks on the street.

00:36.467 --> 00:37.873
- David.
- What is it, Bob?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.591
Emissions from cars and factories,
trapped by the inversion layer.

00:40.846 --> 00:43.321
Combined with the massive pollution
moving across the Pacific,

00:43.506 --> 00:45.921
complicated by the gases
emitting out of Mount Popocatepetl.

00:46.137 --> 00:48.381
Theoretically, David,
we could be heading towards

00:48.465 --> 00:50.342
a perfect pollution storm
over Mexico City.

00:50.427 --> 00:51.943
What the hell
do you guys do here?

00:52.076 --> 00:54.483
Sulfuric acid at that
pH level it'll melt things,

00:54.597 --> 00:56.150
flesh will burn on contact

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:09.368 --> 01:11.521
Now, there's a few hours left.

01:14.197 --> 01:16.541
Forget it, we're not
going get enough ammonia.

01:16.697 --> 01:19.621
No, even if we tapped into U.S.
supplies and got them here in time--

01:19.818 --> 01:21.620
350,000 metric tons would only bring

01:21.756 --> 01:24.912
the pH of the cloud
up to 2.5 maybe if we're lucky.

01:24.987 --> 01:27.172
Clear rain has a pH level of what?

01:27.757 --> 01:29.162
5.6.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.021
- We need something else.
- And a lot of it.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.580
<i>Authorities have decided
to declare the high alert yellow flag...</i>

01:37.896 --> 01:40.770
<i>... Mexico City and outlying areas
in a state of panic. We cannot...</i>

01:40.926 --> 01:43.912
<i>Roads are clogged, people are being
forced onto buses, families are...</i>

01:44.045 --> 01:45.963
<i>...a little girl lost in
the chaos of the evacuation.</i>

01:46.127 --> 01:48.581
<i>Airlines have cancelled
all flights to the Mexixo City airport.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:51.772
The fucking water
in the Gulf of Mexico! OK.

01:52.535 --> 01:55.001
Ocean water has
a pH level of 8.5, right?

01:55.176 --> 01:57.811
And it's full of bicarbonates.
So here's what we're going to do.

01:57.946 --> 02:00.100
The pH level of the acid is 1.

02:00.296 --> 02:02.173
Ocean water's 8.5.

02:02.315 --> 02:04.580
We know that ammonia
will easily neutralize the acid.

02:04.716 --> 02:07.060
So we're going to dump in as much
ammonia as we can get our hands on

02:07.216 --> 02:09.711
- in combination with the ocean water.
- And we got plenty of that.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.913
Bob, what is the pH
we can live with in the rain?

02:12.046 --> 02:13.732
- Five.
- We can live with, Bob.

02:13.857 --> 02:14.870
Four point seven.

02:15.085 --> 02:17.122
Four point seven. OK.
So how much? How much?

02:17.318 --> 02:19.920
350,000 metric tons of ammonia.

02:20.146 --> 02:22.540
48 Canadian air tankers
have landed in California.

02:22.646 --> 02:24.663
Okay,we need water
scoopers too, lots of them.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.792
I'm on it.

02:26.197 --> 02:28.041
David, we could add calcium carbonate.

02:28.237 --> 02:30.713
Sure. How much can we put
in there before it turns to cement?

02:32.146 --> 02:33.060
Bob.

02:33.927 --> 02:34.891
Bob.

02:35.338 --> 02:37.671
- Three hours till it rains acid, David.
- Bob!

02:38.168 --> 02:40.773
3,467 thousand tons.

04:13.328 --> 04:16.700
2.09 - Gene In a Bottle

04:16.877 --> 04:18.603
Yes, we are pretty tied up right now

04:18.765 --> 04:21.160
monitoring the situation
in Mexico City. Anything?

04:21.345 --> 04:23.703
The planes are over Mexico City.
We'll know soon.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.101
Okay. Sorry, Governor.

04:25.358 --> 04:27.471
A 50 percent increase in suicides?

04:27.685 --> 04:31.070
And you don't think it's related
to the hurricane damage Katrina caused?

04:31.517 --> 04:33.752
Yeah, I agree, this is
something we should look into.

04:33.837 --> 04:36.572
So send us all your data.
Medical Examiner. Police.

04:36.686 --> 04:38.433
Psychiatric.
Everything you have.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.183
Okay, bye.

04:43.466 --> 04:44.960
<i>Maman, qu'est-il arrivé ?
 </i>

04:45.168 --> 04:48.521
<i>Carlos, je suis dans le jardin.
Il pleut.
 </i>

04:48.667 --> 04:50.120
<i>S'il te plaît, va dans la maison.
 </i>

04:50.275 --> 04:53.252
<i>Non, non. Je t'appelais pour te dire
 </i>

04:53.437 --> 04:55.233
<i>que tout va bien.
 </i>

04:55.438 --> 04:56.311
<i>Quoi ?
 </i>

04:56.608 --> 05:00.811
<i>Oui, mes bougainvillées,
mes arbustes, mes fleurs,
 </i>

05:01.047 --> 05:04.273
<i>la jardin entier se porte
parfaitement bien sous la pluie.
 </i>

05:04.486 --> 05:08.123
<i>Tout va bien.
 </i>

05:09.547 --> 05:11.023
<i>Grâce à Dieu.
 </i>

05:11.627 --> 05:13.722
We decided ammonia alone

05:13.847 --> 05:16.720
would not work sufficiently
to save the people.

05:16.968 --> 05:21.362
<i>So our scientists at the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico</i>

05:21.537 --> 05:25.702
recommended ocean water
mixed with bicarbonate of soda

05:25.887 --> 05:28.452
<i>and calcium carbonate. It worked...</i>

05:28.888 --> 05:30.132
Brilliantly.

05:31.558 --> 05:33.110
Never should have happened.

05:33.348 --> 05:35.440
It will happen. Again and again.

05:35.766 --> 05:36.882
Mayko!

05:37.657 --> 05:39.223
- What?
- This isn't a hotel.

05:39.345 --> 05:40.962
Go home. Get some sleep.

05:41.227 --> 05:43.490
All of you, go home
and get some sleep.

05:43.736 --> 05:45.492
- Goodnight, David.
- Hey!

05:46.598 --> 05:48.211
Good work, everybody.

05:48.725 --> 05:49.943
Thank  you.

05:52.135 --> 05:53.612
Good work Mayko.

05:54.947 --> 05:57.490
David, I need to talk
to you about a new case.

05:57.636 --> 05:59.843
Can it wait till tomorrow,
Caroline? I'm beat.

06:00.048 --> 06:01.920
- First thing in the morning?
- Promise.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.213
- Okay, goodnight.
- Yeah. Goodnight.

06:14.346 --> 06:15.823
Hey Owen.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.380
- You can read?
- Yeah.

06:18.557 --> 06:19.713
Good.

06:20.677 --> 06:24.573
- Where were you last night?
- Just putting out some fires in Mexico.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.982
Shit. What'd you eat?

06:27.307 --> 06:28.910
I was waiting for you.

06:29.545 --> 06:31.273
Oh. Sorry.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.630
I've got to take a shower. So...

06:37.808 --> 06:40.782
Go down to that 24 hour place and

06:41.037 --> 06:44.010
buy us something that doesn't look
too disgusting, alright?

06:44.605 --> 06:45.841
All right.

06:46.558 --> 06:48.512
Oh, uh. Sorry.

06:48.757 --> 06:51.362
This chick called last night. Said...

06:52.197 --> 06:55.460
Harlan died.
The funeral was today.

06:55.617 --> 06:58.503
And the shiver starts tomorrow.

06:59.847 --> 07:01.130
You OK?

07:02.615 --> 07:04.991
I'll  go get the groceries.

07:47.505 --> 07:48.900
- Hi.
- Shalom.

07:54.045 --> 07:55.402
Laura...

07:59.755 --> 08:02.343
I just got your message
this morning. I'm so sorry.

08:02.627 --> 08:03.823
Thank you.

08:06.005 --> 08:08.401
Can I get you a coffee,
or some cake?

08:08.615 --> 08:09.801
No, I'm fine.

08:09.888 --> 08:11.752
I don't think
you know my sister, Hilda.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.091
Hilda, this is David Sandstrom.
Harlan's friend, David.

08:15.308 --> 08:18.273
Thanks for coming.
He spoke so highly of you.

08:18.478 --> 08:19.801
Excuse us, Hilda.

08:20.015 --> 08:21.603
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.902
So, Laura...

08:25.026 --> 08:28.303
Steven, Julie, I asked you
not to run through the house.

08:32.965 --> 08:34.582
Laura. What happened?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.730
The car was flattened.

08:37.967 --> 08:41.500
When they finally got him out...

08:43.908 --> 08:45.652
it was horrible.

08:48.398 --> 08:50.442
He was drunk, David.

08:51.317 --> 08:52.332
Harlan?

08:53.945 --> 08:55.502
The party.

08:55.625 --> 08:58.143
It was his brother's
birthday party, and...

08:58.817 --> 09:00.550
I'm usually
the designated driver.

09:00.647 --> 09:02.731
But I was at home
with two sick kids...

09:02.907 --> 09:05.210
Laura, do not do that to yourself.

09:06.697 --> 09:08.711
He was always in here.

09:08.855 --> 09:10.503
Working away.

09:11.237 --> 09:12.963
Taking care of us.

09:13.731 --> 09:15.856
I admired him so much.

09:17.045 --> 09:19.650
He always knew how
to balance everything, you know.

09:20.484 --> 09:22.785
His teaching. His research.

09:23.378 --> 09:24.851
You and the kids.

09:25.045 --> 09:26.671
He was a good husband

09:26.946 --> 09:29.943
- and a good man.
- We had a lot of laughs.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.382
Laura,  if there's anything
I can do for you.

09:34.635 --> 09:36.482
- There is something.
- Name it.

09:37.735 --> 09:41.213
Harlan was doing research for Lowy.

09:42.566 --> 09:44.623
The funeral was just yesterday

09:44.756 --> 09:47.393
and they had a lawyer
from the company

09:47.488 --> 09:49.233
come over here last night

09:49.818 --> 09:53.902
asking for Harlan's laptop
and all of his files.

09:53.985 --> 09:55.531
That's corporate paranoia.

09:55.616 --> 09:57.612
See, they figure if you sign
a contract with them,

09:57.698 --> 09:59.773
they own you
and your first born.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.642
I didn't give them anything.

10:02.817 --> 10:04.192
It's just...

10:04.566 --> 10:07.641
Harlan was working on
something on his own.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.520
Nights. Weekends.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.333
- What?
- I don't know.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.060
All I know is he said
what he was working on

10:15.195 --> 10:18.310
could be a potential money-maker.
He said even millions.

10:19.735 --> 10:21.793
You should get a lawyer
to take a look at it.

10:21.896 --> 10:23.982
- Isn't your brother?
- He read the contract.

10:24.198 --> 10:27.871
If it's directly related to what Harlan
was working on, then Lowy owns it.

10:28.358 --> 10:29.833
If not, it's mine.

10:30.818 --> 10:32.623
I just don't know what it is.

10:35.237 --> 10:36.601
You want an opinion?

10:38.025 --> 10:40.310
What's the name of this clown
who came to see you last night?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.021
His card is over here.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.171
This is everything. His lab books...

10:54.658 --> 10:56.443
His computer...

10:57.855 --> 10:59.791
Take whatever you need.

11:00.675 --> 11:01.773
Right.

11:03.185 --> 11:05.943
If there's anything in here,
I'll find it.

11:07.475 --> 11:09.003
I'm a mensch.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.673
It's going to be okay.

11:23.878 --> 11:26.181
Hey Jill!
Hey, what's up?

11:26.457 --> 11:28.320
Hey, Owen.
What are you doing out here?

11:28.496 --> 11:31.552
I'm waiting for David. The prick
at the front desk wouldn't let me in.

11:32.687 --> 11:35.431
- It's cold out.
- You should do up your jacket.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.761
Yeah...

11:37.596 --> 11:40.280
Do you know where he is?
Just thought maybe he could...

11:40.556 --> 11:42.873
- give me some money for food or...
- You alright?

11:43.168 --> 11:44.640
Well, it's cold out.

11:44.727 --> 11:46.010
Are you high?

11:46.308 --> 11:48.180
- What?
- Owen, look at me.

11:48.535 --> 11:49.841
Look at me.

11:51.165 --> 11:54.571
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean what am I doing?

11:54.725 --> 11:56.110
Coke? Crack?

11:56.268 --> 11:57.743
Crystal meth?

11:59.347 --> 12:00.531
Meth?

12:00.825 --> 12:03.223
Wow. Do you know what
you're doing to your brain?

12:03.395 --> 12:05.182
- Fuck you.
- Would you like to know?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.871
OK. So I did a little meth.
What's the big fucking deal?

12:08.958 --> 12:11.361
That meth is carving
a pathway through your veins

12:11.465 --> 12:13.712
trying to get to your brain
and your spinal fluid.

12:13.825 --> 12:15.922
And all of these chemicals:
Norepinephrine, dopamine,

12:15.966 --> 12:17.923
Serotonin,
are gushing out of your brain.

12:18.007 --> 12:20.341
Pressure's going through the roof.
Your heart is racing.

12:20.425 --> 12:22.673
You feel fantastic
and one of these days,

12:22.866 --> 12:25.242
you're going to have a sweet
little convulsion and die.

12:25.556 --> 12:27.512
So that's the big fucking deal.

12:27.607 --> 12:30.931
This is not really what I need, but...

12:31.076 --> 12:32.390
Thanks, Mom.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.031
Owen, don't walk away from me.

12:37.515 --> 12:38.712
Nice.

12:40.688 --> 12:44.080
Caroline. What is all this?
Suicide data from Arkansas?

12:44.227 --> 12:47.970
Oh, good it came in. You're going to have to
make sense of something that makes no sense.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.203
- Sure.
- I want you to go through the data.

12:50.355 --> 12:52.702
Put together a presentation
to get everyone up to speed.

12:52.816 --> 12:54.930
I think this is right up your alley.

12:58.605 --> 13:02.141
Well, looks like he was randomly
inserting promoter traps in a mice.

13:04.037 --> 13:06.473
I love how these things work.
You know, you drop them in,

13:06.616 --> 13:10.523
they cozy up to the gene next to it,
and say, "Hey baby, show me your goods."

13:11.476 --> 13:15.202
Yep. It turns the gene on and
the gene does what it's supposed to do.

13:15.526 --> 13:17.620
Causes cancer, maybe cures it.

13:17.878 --> 13:21.201
- Maybe it grows eyeballs.
- Yeah well...

13:21.568 --> 13:23.601
You know multiple eyeballs,
while very cool,

13:23.776 --> 13:25.810
would hardly be
a reason to tell your wife

13:25.998 --> 13:28.560
you're coming into
a boatload of dough, right?

13:29.226 --> 13:32.770
Actually I think these genes have
something to do with sexual reproduction.

13:33.126 --> 13:35.723
Multiple orgasms? I'd pay for that.

13:42.298 --> 13:44.751
This one in particular, David...

13:44.998 --> 13:47.022
This one here,
it's always been a suspect.

13:47.585 --> 13:49.502
So what was he looking for?

13:50.565 --> 13:52.953
- Was he a close friend?
- Used to be.

13:53.315 --> 13:56.680
Then he had kids and sort of disappeared
into the bosom of his family.

13:57.798 --> 14:00.353
Which is maybe something
I should have done.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.890
Good scientist?

14:05.048 --> 14:08.052
Very, but he was more...
you know, tortoise than hare.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.560
Hard worker,
never gave up.

14:10.995 --> 14:13.001
You had to admire his tenacity, but

14:13.166 --> 14:15.892
if Harlan found something,
he stumbled on it, no question.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.472
Well, it's not going to be easy,
to recreate his stumbling.

14:25.766 --> 14:28.973
FL472. He didn't finish
a history on this one.

14:32.765 --> 14:34.703
What do you make of this?

14:39.495 --> 14:42.383
It looks like some kind of code.

14:42.958 --> 14:44.680
FL472.

14:46.878 --> 14:48.431
Well, the mice are at the U of T.

14:48.578 --> 14:51.323
So let's get the little guys down here,
and find out what they do.

14:57.886 --> 14:59.940
Owen, I need to speak with you.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.942
Call me when you get this message.

15:02.437 --> 15:04.441
200 bucks missing from my wallet.

15:05.068 --> 15:06.562
- Owen?
- No, elves.

15:06.738 --> 15:09.501
All  I know is that I took
300 bucks out of the machine last night

15:09.615 --> 15:11.421
I spent 40,
now I've got 60.

15:11.658 --> 15:12.770
Well...

15:13.136 --> 15:15.940
I have a pretty good idea
what he spent it on.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.332
I saw him about an hour ago.
He was flying.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.940
-  On what?
- Meth.

15:21.047 --> 15:23.083
You know the shit they're selling
on the street these days.

15:23.526 --> 15:26.832
Some of it's got lithium
from batteries, lye,

15:26.966 --> 15:29.852
red phosphorus from matches.
It's poison, he's going to kill himself.

15:30.027 --> 15:32.173
So I'm not going to get my money
back, so is what you're saying.

15:32.217 --> 15:35.843
What I'm saying is, if you ever see him
again - which you probably won't -

15:35.926 --> 15:38.722
tell him to stop
- which he probably won't -

15:38.836 --> 15:41.141
and then all you can do is wait
for him to hit rock bottom,

15:41.265 --> 15:42.640
which he absolutely will.

15:44.816 --> 15:46.392
Thanks for getting me into this.
// FIN PARTIE 1

15:49.567 --> 15:51.981
Hey Carlos! Our visitors are here.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.201
Thanks.

15:59.105 --> 16:00.722
Welcome to NorBAC.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.122
It's been a long time since
I had a chance to do mouse work.

16:03.287 --> 16:05.873
You usually work
in breeding pairs. Don't you?

16:06.255 --> 16:09.163
- Yes.
- Well according to these labels...

16:11.256 --> 16:12.872
They're all boys.

16:15.585 --> 16:18.582
Maybe there is something special
about these males.

16:19.226 --> 16:21.622
Harlan seemed to be
studying reproduction,

16:21.745 --> 16:25.353
maybe he was studying male
reproductive diseases:

16:25.645 --> 16:27.200
prostate cancer.

16:29.686 --> 16:31.160
Hi guys.

16:34.945 --> 16:36.833
We're waiting for you, david.

16:37.477 --> 16:40.200
- What's going on?
- Have a seat. Mayko.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.370
Okay, so...

16:42.578 --> 16:47.332
This is the path of Hurricane Katrina
in the summer of 2005.

16:47.876 --> 16:52.223
Now, after major disasters, suicides
in affected zones usually increase 30%.

16:52.608 --> 16:54.771
- What are we talking about?
- Just listen.

16:54.918 --> 16:55.970
Okay? But...

16:56.127 --> 17:00.373
the spike in the suicide rate from the
area in question is actually a 50% spike.

17:00.517 --> 17:03.061
And, it's not part of Katrina's path.

17:04.895 --> 17:08.579
So, these people
actually weren't affected

17:08.726 --> 17:11.143
by the devastation.
The increase in suicides started

17:11.268 --> 17:14.392
in New Orleans, as expected.
But then over the last year or so,

17:14.588 --> 17:16.871
it spread up through here
and as high as Arkansas.

17:17.066 --> 17:19.260
Suicide?
Suicides don't "spread".

17:19.435 --> 17:22.662
From what I've been told, suicide
is higher amongst teens and seniors

17:22.877 --> 17:24.221
and usually

17:24.787 --> 17:28.141
there are different suicide rates
for males and females, different races.

17:28.316 --> 17:30.713
True.
But in the counties in the 50% zone,

17:30.826 --> 17:34.111
the results are the same
across all demographics. Even kids.

17:34.876 --> 17:37.950
- Kids?
- Wes contacted some families of victims.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.341
One of them emailed me this.

17:42.877 --> 17:45.853
- He's 7 years old.
- Cute. Happy go-lucky.

17:46.075 --> 17:50.140
Much loved. Two days after this was
taken, he grew severely depressed.

17:50.317 --> 17:53.262
Two more days, and somehow
he made his way to a bridge.

17:53.528 --> 17:57.283
They found him a few hours later
downstream, snagged on a branch.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.893
- So people are killing themselves for no reason.
- Yeah.

18:00.156 --> 18:03.723
They're happy, healthy.
And then sudden depression.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.891
CDC's been tracking this for weeks.
They want us to have a look at it.

18:07.017 --> 18:09.623
It sounds like a job
for a bunch of shrinks, not NorBAC.

18:09.807 --> 18:11.892
Come on David, don't you think
this is weird? I mean, little kids...

18:12.057 --> 18:14.183
little kids don't just
kill themselves.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.361
I thought you said
everything was biology.

18:16.518 --> 18:18.340
All behavior. All emotion.

18:18.427 --> 18:21.141
No, I said all behavior
has a biological component.

18:22.138 --> 18:23.800
Including depression?

18:25.287 --> 18:26.551
Yes.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.683
Okay. So let me reframe it for you.

18:28.806 --> 18:33.553
Find me the biological component
in suicidal people in the 50% zone.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.762
- Sure, Caroline, piece of cake.
- Thank you.

18:38.947 --> 18:40.813
I want to get
somebody right on that.

18:42.316 --> 18:43.573
What?

18:44.077 --> 18:45.132
Yeah.

18:46.097 --> 18:48.732
Oh hi, Jim. I got your number
from Laura Sendak.

18:49.565 --> 18:52.713
I'd like to get together with you,
it's about Harlan's research.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.110
Oh, I know you're interested.

18:56.277 --> 18:58.672
Well if it's not prostate cancer...

19:01.556 --> 19:05.212
"Mice sterile after promotor trap
placed beside gene X-313

19:05.365 --> 19:09.260
of chromosome 4. Tested sperm, good
motility, no pathology. So what's wrong?"

19:09.546 --> 19:10.962
And it ends there.

19:11.695 --> 19:14.350
What if he stumbled upon PEA3 mice?

19:14.645 --> 19:16.100
- What's that?
- Well...

19:16.278 --> 19:20.021
The males provide
complete testosterone but are sterile.

19:20.177 --> 19:22.601
The female mammary glands
develop abnormally.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.001
It's always been a bit of
a race to figure out why.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.192
- Worth money?
- Well...

19:27.508 --> 19:29.362
If it transfers
to human infertility, yes.

19:29.706 --> 19:31.151
We should look into that.

19:32.196 --> 19:33.523
Absolutely.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.410
What else?

20:11.988 --> 20:13.481
I don't know.

20:15.355 --> 20:18.200
How long would it take
to get female mice in heat?

20:18.438 --> 20:21.432
Five minutes.
There's always some downstairs. Why?

20:21.928 --> 20:25.063
We're starting a reproductive gene,
let's see what they got.

20:38.627 --> 20:40.491
Okay. Go.

20:41.228 --> 20:43.823
It looks like he's more
interested in the buffet, Bob.

20:55.247 --> 20:57.182
He looks like
he's about to take a nap.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.720
I think generally that's done afterwards.

21:02.727 --> 21:04.411
I want to try something.

21:08.388 --> 21:10.761
Carlos,  what are you doing?
Males will kill each other.

21:10.908 --> 21:12.341
Maybe these won't.

21:12.495 --> 21:15.842
Still, it's not our experiment
to... experiment with.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.760
Bob, I don't think
they're going to fight.

21:18.525 --> 21:20.470
I have a feeling that these boys...

21:22.266 --> 21:23.600
would rather...

21:41.126 --> 21:42.181
What?

21:42.797 --> 21:46.891
I suspect that he randomly placed
the promoter trap next to a gene.

21:47.346 --> 21:48.453
Yeah.

21:48.665 --> 21:51.511
But that gene was
the gene that determines...

21:51.707 --> 21:53.080
sexual preference!

21:53.808 --> 21:55.510
No fucking way!

21:56.146 --> 21:59.200
- Harlan... He did?
- Maybe.

21:59.456 --> 22:03.521
I think he had scientific evidence
that being gay is genetic.

22:04.316 --> 22:06.772
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
In a mouse!

22:07.066 --> 22:10.703
No. If I had a dollar for every
time cancer got cured in mice

22:10.838 --> 22:14.023
and they couldn't translate it to humans,
I'd be a millionaire. So let's just...

22:16.026 --> 22:17.950
Let's just sit down.

22:25.296 --> 22:27.000
What else could it be?

22:29.857 --> 22:31.352
Maybe it's a gene

22:31.485 --> 22:34.811
that makes the males smell like females
and that's why they're humping each other.

22:34.975 --> 22:37.473
- But they wouldn't hump the females.
- Oh, shit.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.120
You know, he had a lot on X-313.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.270
Okay, okay. Bob, I'm going
to need you to pull up that section

22:41.396 --> 22:43.891
of human DNA that corresponds
to the mouse DNA.

22:44.067 --> 22:47.432
On average, there's an 85% similarity
between human and mouse genes.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.500
Yeah, I know.

22:48.706 --> 22:51.580
So there's a 15% likelihood
that they don't match.

22:51.755 --> 22:55.482
But I think if it's similar there's a high
probability that it does exist in humans.

23:02.046 --> 23:04.913
X-313 on chromosome 4. Human DNA.

23:05.106 --> 23:08.732
The corresponding region
is on chromosome 8. And...

23:09.715 --> 23:11.081
Here's the gene.

23:12.315 --> 23:14.871
Okay. See here?

23:15.875 --> 23:17.500
And here?

23:18.968 --> 23:22.041
They look 99.9% identical.

23:22.297 --> 23:24.180
One amino acid difference.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.142
And so... wow.

23:29.437 --> 23:31.712
Your friend was right, David.
This is huge.

23:32.117 --> 23:34.822
Bob, I want you to go into
the genome bank, and pull up

23:34.945 --> 23:37.822
10 heterosexual males and 10 homosexual
males. We'll compare them.

23:39.386 --> 23:40.860
Then we'll know.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.491
Of gay mice and gay men.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.531
Match.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.200
Match.

23:56.155 --> 23:57.432
Close enough.

23:58.018 --> 23:59.033
Match.

24:04.597 --> 24:06.572
- Match.
- Ten of ten.

24:06.707 --> 24:08.243
- Heteros.
- Match.

24:10.705 --> 24:12.922
- Jesus... match.
- Is this for real?

24:16.206 --> 24:18.323
- They all match!
- Shit!

24:18.827 --> 24:20.301
This is incredible!

24:21.666 --> 24:24.721
OK, we should really keep quiet about this
until we figure out the right way to deal with it.

24:24.936 --> 24:25.870
Why?

24:25.916 --> 24:28.291
It's not our discovery, Bob, for one thing.

24:28.378 --> 24:30.541
And then, you know,
just putting it out there...

24:31.008 --> 24:32.801
Help me out with this.

24:32.885 --> 24:36.353
Well, the psychosocial impact
of an announcement like this

24:36.526 --> 24:38.262
- could cause more harm than good.
- Exactly.

24:38.345 --> 24:42.221
And there's something else. Harlan said
this was gonna make him rich.

24:42.318 --> 24:46.022
Discovering the gay gene might bring you
a lot of fame, but not necessarily fortune.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.141
Unless you could find a way
to affect the function of that gene.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.600
What do you mean?

24:50.657 --> 24:53.290
- Never mind.
- It's okay, Bob.

24:53.795 --> 24:57.170
Well, if you've got a gene
that promotes a certain type of behavior,

24:57.315 --> 24:59.840
especially one that's considered
undesirable in a lot of places

25:00.007 --> 25:02.500
amongst a lot of people,
wouldn't you want to see if you can...

25:04.125 --> 25:05.590
turn that behavior off?

25:05.756 --> 25:09.463
A drug. Or a chemical
compound to suppress the gene.

25:09.848 --> 25:12.132
- Maybe it was his next move.
- It'd be my next move.

25:12.925 --> 25:15.442
This makes a lot of sense.
I found a patent application

25:15.595 --> 25:17.310
for a molecule in Harlan's lab books.

25:17.506 --> 25:20.011
He'd put it through various testing
processes that make me think

25:20.098 --> 25:23.681
its utility was drug-related. I think it
might have had something to do with the mice.

25:23.766 --> 25:26.023
- Order it.
- You can't.

25:26.565 --> 25:29.443
But we can get a chemist
to synthesize it for us.

25:29.638 --> 25:31.380
Okay, do it.
Let's try it out.

25:34.447 --> 25:36.983
- Hey, David.
- Owen, good to see you.

25:37.467 --> 25:40.700
You going back to the loft?
I thought I'd hitch a ride.

25:40.787 --> 25:43.990
Sure, let's talk about some money first
though. I take it you borrowed some from me.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.911
- What?
- 200 bucks. From my wallet on the dresser.

25:46.997 --> 25:48.500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:48.845 --> 25:50.061
Look at me.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.062
Hey! Look at me.

25:52.816 --> 25:54.421
You sound a lot like your girlfriend.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.422
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Okay, well, your friend, Jill.

25:57.658 --> 25:59.223
She's had it out
for me from the start

25:59.305 --> 26:00.883
and I don't know what the hell
she's been feeding you.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.710
- Maybe the truth.
- Maybe bullshit.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.103
I want you out of my place, Owen.
Gimme my keys back.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.171
- I was gonna pay you back.
- Oh really?

26:09.316 --> 26:11.851
Would you get a job or you gonna
steal the money from somebody else?

26:12.236 --> 26:13.842
The keys, Owen. Come on!

26:13.988 --> 26:15.980
I was gonna pay you back!
I'm not a thief.

26:16.078 --> 26:18.290
Look, to show you
there are no hard feelings,

26:18.487 --> 26:21.930
here's the rest of it. And that's
the last you're going to get from me.

26:31.468 --> 26:32.802
The point I'm trying to make is

26:32.956 --> 26:35.501
that Western society is starting
to accept homosexuality.

26:35.876 --> 26:38.952
- Slowly, but yes.
- Yeah, but come on, it's come a long way.

26:39.127 --> 26:40.870
And if this drug works, it could...

26:41.036 --> 26:43.740
set it all back to
attitudes of fifty years ago.

26:44.017 --> 26:47.220
That your disease can be
cured with this handy little pill.

26:47.555 --> 26:51.143
But all I'm saying, David, is
that men in different parts of the world

26:51.285 --> 26:53.263
would appreciate having a choice.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.413
Well what about you, Carlos?

26:55.628 --> 26:58.183
What if you got tested and discovered
that you didn't have the gene?

26:58.766 --> 27:00.973
Does that make you a pervert?
Does it erase

27:01.106 --> 27:03.263
all the years you've spent fighting
for who you are?

27:03.568 --> 27:06.740
Okay, look. Let's just
hang on to this for a little while.

27:06.896 --> 27:09.412
We'll test the drug. Think about
what the fuck to do with it.

27:09.498 --> 27:11.202
Let's not worry about
it right now. Okay?

27:11.588 --> 27:12.743
- Okay.
- Bob?

27:14.336 --> 27:16.850
Did you know lobsters are cannibals?

27:17.467 --> 27:20.411
It's true. If put them in a cage
together they'll eat each other.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.660
Well, that's why I invited you over here tonight, Bob.

27:22.845 --> 27:24.641
So you could eat them before
they ate each other.

27:24.888 --> 27:26.350
Thank you, David.

27:27.265 --> 27:29.563
- Beer's here.
- It's about time.

27:30.017 --> 27:31.513
So, what's going on?

27:32.088 --> 27:34.063
Well, we think we found...

27:34.268 --> 27:38.350
Well, David's friend found
the gene for sexual preference.

27:38.946 --> 27:40.582
A gay gene?

27:40.905 --> 27:43.032
The gene for sexual preference.

27:43.366 --> 27:45.532
So, what... for women and men?

27:45.825 --> 27:48.663
Yes and no.
You see if a man gets it,

27:49.015 --> 27:50.742
he is more attracted to men.

27:50.875 --> 27:54.060
If a woman gets it,
she's more attracted to men too.

27:54.187 --> 27:56.142
- So it's like a horny gene?
- I guess so.

27:58.895 --> 28:00.052
Bon appetit.

28:01.558 --> 28:05.182
I don't know David, I think you're opening
up some very delicate ethical issues.

28:05.306 --> 28:08.953
What's the problem? Some redneck gets
tired of the "homo" he's working with,

28:09.017 --> 28:10.931
just slips him a couple
of pills in his coffee.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.370
What about the US military?

28:12.517 --> 28:15.101
There goes the whole homosexuality
deferment issue out the window.

28:16.015 --> 28:18.013
And let's not even go there
with the Christian Right.

28:18.438 --> 28:21.580
- Anybody want ice cream?
- God, I am totally full.

28:21.785 --> 28:25.222
You find a gene, next comes
a genetic test and then a cure.

28:32.057 --> 28:34.700
Sorry, it must just be the baby.

28:35.438 --> 28:38.831
We got our tests results back.
He's gonna be a boy.

28:39.127 --> 28:41.780
Brown hair. Blue eyes,
6 feet like his Daddy.

28:43.437 --> 28:46.140
But Mike's having second thoughts...

28:48.935 --> 28:50.813
The baby's gonna be gay.

28:56.728 --> 28:58.931
Sorry, Mayko.
Did you want ice cream?

28:59.086 --> 29:00.552
No, David
I don't want any.

29:01.428 --> 29:03.903
- Um... Bob, ice cream?
- Ice cream!

29:10.056 --> 29:14.611
<i>I was miserable. Now, for my heartburn,
I take "Latrapsalin."</i>

29:15.298 --> 29:17.552
<i>And for my homosexual tendencies,</i>

29:17.698 --> 29:18.923
<i>I reach for "Gay Away",</i>

29:19.158 --> 29:21.750
<i>the dust that makes fairies fly away.</i>

29:22.297 --> 29:24.900
<i>Fast acting Latrapsalin.
For heartburn relief</i>

29:25.045 --> 29:27.070
<i>when you need it most.</i>

29:29.008 --> 29:30.050
Carlos?

29:31.005 --> 29:32.340
- Ice cream?
- Thank you.

29:32.558 --> 29:36.053
So does the world really need
a "cure" for homosexuality?

29:36.277 --> 29:39.542
- Is it a disease?
- We're asking the wrong questions here.

29:40.098 --> 29:41.881
Take the guys
who built the bomb, right.

29:42.256 --> 29:43.860
I don't think the question
for them was ever

29:44.026 --> 29:46.343
"Should we build it?" They had to.
It was either them or the Nazis.

29:46.528 --> 29:49.322
I think the questions that
kept them up at night was probably...

29:50.305 --> 29:52.232
Who's going to build it first?

29:52.507 --> 29:53.593
You know.

29:54.486 --> 29:56.190
And what's going to be done with it?

29:59.345 --> 30:01.501
So what are we going to do
with our bomb, guys?

30:09.425 --> 30:12.270
David, Caroline really wants us
to get on this suicide thing.

30:12.457 --> 30:17.103
- Okay, I heard you. What?
- Okay. So the Brenner County report says:

30:17.307 --> 30:20.561
"suicide is normally associated
with family breakdown, poverty,

30:20.725 --> 30:23.453
unemployment, drug abuse,
alcoholism, and incarceration...

30:23.627 --> 30:26.280
However, research shows
recent suicides in the county

30:26.378 --> 30:28.010
no longer follow this pattern."

30:28.107 --> 30:30.410
It's the same old crap
over and over, Mayko.

30:30.566 --> 30:32.261
Everybody is saying
something is wrong, I get it.

30:32.378 --> 30:34.601
I know. And no one
is saying what it might be.

30:36.646 --> 30:38.991
It looks like we're starting
from scratch on this one.

30:40.037 --> 30:41.300
Wes!

30:44.477 --> 30:46.513
Where the fuck are those body parts?

30:46.958 --> 30:49.450
If you mean the samples
from the suicide victims,

30:49.567 --> 30:51.200
they'll be here this afternoon.

30:54.055 --> 30:56.142
- .3 ccs, right?
- Right.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.911
Any idea how long before
this takes effect?

30:59.478 --> 31:02.603
No. Even the chemist who put
it together doesn't know what it was for.

31:02.818 --> 31:04.392
Well, let's find out.

31:04.766 --> 31:07.530
And David will probably
want to know what happens.

31:07.668 --> 31:09.203
I'll go get him.
// FIN PARTIE 2

31:29.595 --> 31:31.070
Homosexual male,

31:31.268 --> 31:33.580
meet heterosexual females-in-heat.

31:39.216 --> 31:41.593
Now there's a boy
who knows how to tango.

31:42.326 --> 31:44.573
David, you got
an update on the suicides?

31:44.697 --> 31:46.512
I'm working on it.
I'm busy right now.

31:47.695 --> 31:50.380
- Is this business or pleasure?
- A little bit of both.

31:50.556 --> 31:53.511
David, I've got two Governors
calling wanting answers.

31:54.157 --> 31:56.030
- Get on it.
- Okay.

32:04.358 --> 32:05.800
Here.

32:12.605 --> 32:14.580
Mayko, body parts.

32:14.855 --> 32:17.303
- Oh. Thanks, Wes.
- Update please, Mayko.

32:17.418 --> 32:19.512
Caroline is breathing down
my neck on this thing.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.583
McGuinn's calling,
Governors are all over him.

32:21.827 --> 32:24.193
Where's our money going,
what's the use of NorBAC, do you get it?

32:24.377 --> 32:26.783
- Chill out, Wes.
- I'm completely chill.

32:27.995 --> 32:31.892
Okay. Initial pathology on the
suicides from Arkansas looks fine

32:32.065 --> 32:35.281
but neurotransmitter levels
had spikes in dopamine and serotonin.

32:35.435 --> 32:38.233
- What does that mean?
- Well basically there's nothing grossly abnormal

32:38.345 --> 32:39.851
about the specimens but...

32:40.167 --> 32:43.060
David thinks it points to
a chemical imbalance somewhere.

32:43.298 --> 32:45.262
- I see.
- So, we're going to run some tests

32:45.456 --> 32:48.740
and see if we can identify
any chemicals that might be in the brain

32:48.915 --> 32:52.303
and hopefully that'll give us
a clue as to what is causing this.

32:52.395 --> 32:54.360
Thank you, Mayko.
Let me know what you come up with.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.861
Sure.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.973
Okay, so.
David wants blood to Sunnybrook.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.301
Intestines to U of T.
Pulmonary to Queen's.

33:02.396 --> 33:06.082
Heart tissue to Mt. Sinai. We're doing
liver, kidney, pancreas and brain here.

33:48.866 --> 33:50.493
What you'd do?
Rob a Starbucks?

33:50.865 --> 33:53.420
No. I picked up some bottles
and cans and...

33:54.305 --> 33:56.902
I did some panhandling
but I didn't steal it.

33:59.426 --> 34:01.991
- Look, I know I fucked up.
- You stoned now?

34:02.138 --> 34:03.393
- No.
- You were yesterday

34:03.495 --> 34:04.972
when you came looking for me.

34:06.038 --> 34:08.400
I was on the street,
and some guy offered me a toke.

34:08.598 --> 34:10.380
Oh. So you were just being polite, eh?

34:11.318 --> 34:13.270
Look, I know
you're mad at me, and...

34:13.527 --> 34:15.820
you probably don't want
anything to do with me.

34:17.618 --> 34:21.360
I'm sick, man...
I know I got a problem.

34:21.556 --> 34:23.091
What do you want, Owen?

34:25.578 --> 34:26.981
I just...

34:27.554 --> 34:32.382
I know I need to get better
but that's hard to do out there.

34:34.908 --> 34:37.742
I just... need a place.

34:39.348 --> 34:41.692
Look, I wanna beat this. I do.

34:48.065 --> 34:49.083
Come in.

34:57.108 --> 34:59.933
I have no idea what that is, Bob.

35:00.897 --> 35:03.871
I found a phorbol.
No one's ever seen before.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.892
Bob, there's thousands of phorbols.

35:06.996 --> 35:10.781
Actually, there are 1832.
This is 1833.

35:11.566 --> 35:13.410
Okay, where did you find it?

35:14.616 --> 35:17.080
I found it in all the samples
of the suicide victims.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.413
Brains, and all the other organs.

35:20.297 --> 35:22.352
Fuck... PKC.

35:26.226 --> 35:28.200
Maybe I made a mistake
interpreting the data.

35:28.426 --> 35:29.600
I doubt it.

35:30.976 --> 35:34.550
PKC. Protein Kinase C.

35:34.676 --> 35:37.262
It is an enzyme that does
important work in your body.

35:37.306 --> 35:39.030
What does this protein
do exactly?

35:39.186 --> 35:42.772
In the brain, too little, you get
depressed. Too much, you get bipolar.

35:42.855 --> 35:44.931
- And both roads can lead to suicide.
- Exactly.

35:45.067 --> 35:48.283
In a normal brain, you got regulators
to control the level of PKC.

35:48.567 --> 35:51.361
- Neurotransmitters.
- Right. It's all part of normal nerve function.

35:51.446 --> 35:54.911
But the neurotransmitters can get
thrown off by these things called phorbols.

35:55.147 --> 35:56.721
- Fur balls?
- Phorbols.

35:56.956 --> 35:59.812
We use them in the lab
all the time in our experiments.

35:59.938 --> 36:02.530
Like if you want to activate
cancer growth in human cells.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.241
- They also activate PKC.
- So that's it? Phorbols?

36:05.406 --> 36:07.343
Not exactly.
The people west of the Mississippi,

36:07.526 --> 36:10.592
they have a lot of a phorbol
of some kind in their system.

36:10.785 --> 36:11.821
And?

36:12.027 --> 36:14.093
Phorbols don't occur naturally
in humans.

36:14.195 --> 36:16.131
- So where'd they come from?
- I have no idea.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.840
They belong in trees and stuff.
And there's something else.

36:19.686 --> 36:22.112
This is a new one.
It's never been seen before.

36:24.005 --> 36:25.801
Bart?
David Sandstrom.

36:27.056 --> 36:30.170
The Leafs are doing just fine,
thank you very much. Listen...

36:30.466 --> 36:32.650
Oh absolutely.
Make it a hundred. Listen,

36:32.777 --> 36:35.590
we found some phorbols
in some suicide victims.

36:36.095 --> 36:38.402
You know, I know
it doesn't make any sense.

36:39.468 --> 36:42.001
I don't know, Bart,
that's why I'm calling you.

36:42.926 --> 36:46.000
Well look, do you know of
anybody who might be able to...

36:46.335 --> 36:47.920
- Got a minute?
- Hang on, Bart.

36:48.258 --> 36:49.423
No. What?

36:49.578 --> 36:52.300
I just got a phone call
from Audrey Graves, remember her?

36:52.777 --> 36:56.732
Bart, just see what you can find out
and call me back. Thanks.

36:57.258 --> 36:59.752
So, Audrey, eh?
How's she doing?

36:59.927 --> 37:03.423
Health wise, pretty good. Same with
the baby. She's back to work full time.

37:03.907 --> 37:06.380
- Good.
- She wanted some answers.

37:07.627 --> 37:08.750
About what?

37:09.087 --> 37:10.771
Harlan Sendak.

37:11.277 --> 37:12.680
What about him?

37:12.796 --> 37:14.790
According to Audrey
he was doing some work

37:14.955 --> 37:16.702
- for Lowy Pharmaceuticals.
- Yeah.

37:17.478 --> 37:18.811
Lowy have filed an injunction

37:18.936 --> 37:21.771
that we - NorBAC - are not releasing
research that belongs to them.

37:22.048 --> 37:25.182
NorBAC has nothing to do
with Harlan's personal research.

37:25.497 --> 37:28.142
- Not according to Audrey.
- I don't care.

37:28.797 --> 37:31.432
Harlan Sendak
was a friend of mine.

37:31.838 --> 37:35.622
And he died in a car crash last week.
So what's the problem?

37:36.345 --> 37:39.042
You've been spending a lot of time
on this personal project?

37:39.186 --> 37:40.480
Yeah, so?

37:40.626 --> 37:43.413
So, you should have told me
before using the lab's resources

37:43.605 --> 37:46.602
- and our scientists' time to help you do it.
- Come on, Caroline.

37:47.005 --> 37:48.820
David, we entered
into an agreement

37:49.046 --> 37:51.480
with Audrey Graves
and American Pharmaceuticals.

37:51.698 --> 37:54.150
No, you have entered
into an agreement.

37:54.347 --> 37:57.191
A 35 million dollar agreement, David.

37:57.467 --> 38:00.942
So, if they want to have a look at some
research that they feel is potentially theirs,

38:01.117 --> 38:02.751
we have an obligation
to show it to them.

38:02.926 --> 38:05.051
- It's not theirs.
- Then let them determine that.

38:05.215 --> 38:06.110
No.

38:06.448 --> 38:09.182
Not this stuff.
Not this time. Okay?

38:10.238 --> 38:12.902
Just gimme a break
with this one, Caroline.

38:14.195 --> 38:17.362
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Come on in.

38:21.186 --> 38:23.493
- Anything else?
- Yeah. You work on any outside projects,

38:23.806 --> 38:26.393
you find a cure for the common cold,
you buy a pencil,

38:26.537 --> 38:28.543
I want to know about it.
Understood?

38:28.876 --> 38:30.141
- Sure thing.
- Good.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.063
- Carlos.
- Hey.

38:33.537 --> 38:36.921
- Let's take a walk.
- What was that all about?

38:37.037 --> 38:39.531
Lowy Pharmaceuticals wants
Harlan's research.

38:39.697 --> 38:41.743
- How do you know?
- I met with one of their lawyers.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.131
I was trying to keep things personal,

38:43.266 --> 38:45.550
but now they're going after NorBAC,
so we're running out of time.

38:45.646 --> 38:48.281
The truth is, David, I don't think
we can hold the research any longer.

38:48.468 --> 38:51.692
If we give this to Lowy, they're going
to figure out a way to make it their own.

38:51.927 --> 38:54.223
I'm sure they will.
It's a very powerful discovery.

38:54.345 --> 38:56.942
Yeah. A discovery
that was made by Harlan Sendak.

38:57.617 --> 39:00.051
Maybe you should talk to Laura?
See what she wants to do.

39:00.206 --> 39:02.383
Man, I already got
something in the works.

39:02.807 --> 39:05.381
- I could have come up.
- Nah-nah, it's all right.

39:05.725 --> 39:07.693
Did you want to talk
to me about something?

39:07.848 --> 39:09.612
- It can wait.
- Okay.

39:12.685 --> 39:14.283
You wanted to talk?

39:15.045 --> 39:16.712
Why did you let Owen back in?

39:16.937 --> 39:19.221
- What happened to "give the kid a chance"?
- I'm sorry.

39:19.337 --> 39:21.533
That was before
I knew he was using.

39:21.797 --> 39:24.050
Don't worry, he was clean
when he came home.

39:25.286 --> 39:26.881
He's lying to you, David.

39:27.535 --> 39:29.093
How'd you know that.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.821
I know addicts.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.860
All right.

39:36.728 --> 39:39.840
Okay. My "thing" was prescription pills.

39:40.267 --> 39:42.402
I went through treatment three times.

39:42.996 --> 39:45.283
And the third time worked.
It was eleven years ago, okay.

39:45.395 --> 39:48.212
- I've never gone back.
- Jill, I've seen you drink.

39:49.307 --> 39:51.530
Recovering addicts didn't drink.

39:52.456 --> 39:54.882
Right, well, alcohol
was never my addiction.

39:55.055 --> 39:56.990
Although I'm sure someday
it could be.

39:57.117 --> 39:58.820
Or cigarettes or God or...

39:59.997 --> 40:01.592
Who knows? Um...

40:02.306 --> 40:05.151
The only reason I'm telling
you this is because...

40:05.538 --> 40:07.572
I don't want you to
get hurt by Owen, okay?

40:07.687 --> 40:09.222
You can't trust him.

40:09.447 --> 40:11.382
He's not who you think he is.

40:14.565 --> 40:16.441
What do you want me to do, Jill?

40:18.095 --> 40:19.820
Just watch your back.

40:22.826 --> 40:24.202
Okay.

40:33.995 --> 40:35.711
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:36.328 --> 40:37.790
What's going on?

40:39.188 --> 40:40.473
Nothing.

40:40.725 --> 40:42.440
What'd you do today?

40:42.716 --> 40:44.260
Just chilled here.

40:45.578 --> 40:47.473
Got any plans for tomorrow?

40:47.856 --> 40:49.092
Not really.

40:56.647 --> 40:59.412
- You do any shit today?
- Meth?

41:00.685 --> 41:01.861
No.

41:02.856 --> 41:04.571
Do you want to?

41:06.607 --> 41:08.031
Yeah.

41:10.976 --> 41:13.501
Okay. Um...

41:15.548 --> 41:18.030
If you're going to stay here,
we gotta do something about that.

41:18.288 --> 41:19.921
I am.
I'm staying away from it.

41:20.067 --> 41:22.553
No. It's not just enough
to stay away from it, Owen.

41:22.635 --> 41:24.671
'Cause it's everywhere. It's like...

41:24.766 --> 41:27.092
It's like there's a bar
on every block in this town.

41:27.187 --> 41:29.760
Some days, I feel like
I could hit every one of them.

41:30.028 --> 41:31.483
You ever do that?

41:33.397 --> 41:35.560
Yeah, I've been known to.

41:35.648 --> 41:37.482
Okay, yeah, on occasion.

41:37.987 --> 41:40.192
But it's not a habit,
you understand what I'm saying?

41:40.666 --> 41:41.820
Yeah.

41:42.135 --> 41:44.280
Okay, so here's
what's going down.

41:44.368 --> 41:45.942
You're going to get some help

41:46.076 --> 41:47.863
and you're gonna enroll in

41:47.986 --> 41:50.292
a program that's going
to get you off the drugs.

41:50.487 --> 41:54.562
And then you're going to get a job. And
then you're going to get up every morning.

41:54.668 --> 41:56.392
And you're going to go to work.

41:56.577 --> 41:59.052
And you're going to live your life like,

41:59.168 --> 42:01.512
you know,
a relatively normal human being.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.952
- Okay.
- No. Just...

42:04.066 --> 42:06.840
I mean, yes, okay,
but don't just say "okay", okay?

42:06.928 --> 42:08.552
Because this is
what's going to happen, Owen.

42:08.597 --> 42:11.262
Or that door's going to hit you
on the ass on the way out, okay?

42:11.497 --> 42:13.952
David. I'm going to do this.

42:14.527 --> 42:16.323
I want to do this.

42:18.958 --> 42:20.051
Okay.

42:20.518 --> 42:21.823
Okay.

42:24.457 --> 42:25.892
Keep it down.

42:43.275 --> 42:44.461
Okay...

42:44.655 --> 42:46.302
You want me
to go in with you?

42:47.228 --> 42:48.892
Right. Got it.

42:49.385 --> 42:52.211
So, new city, new chance.

42:53.688 --> 42:55.572
I know it's cheesy,
but it's true.

42:56.726 --> 42:57.851
Thanks.

42:58.498 --> 43:00.233
See ya later.

43:46.155 --> 43:49.863
- Mayko?
- Right here, Jesus. God.

43:50.205 --> 43:53.311
Where's Harlan's hard drive?
His lab books. All his stuff?

43:53.825 --> 43:56.623
It was right here

43:56.835 --> 43:59.223
when I left yesterday.

43:59.395 --> 44:00.700
That's weird.

44:01.808 --> 44:03.121
Oh, no.

44:06.135 --> 44:08.171
Thank you for telling me all this.

44:08.257 --> 44:10.301
Harlan did some incredible work.

44:12.927 --> 44:14.533
It belongs to you now.

44:15.436 --> 44:18.220
- What is this?
- That is a patent.

44:18.517 --> 44:22.662
For the gene he discovered
and a compound that will turn it off.

44:23.545 --> 44:25.743
I was working all week
with a lawyer friend of mine.

44:25.835 --> 44:27.732
He wrangled it
through the patent office for you.

44:28.337 --> 44:32.302
So, now you can go to Lowy...
on your own terms if you want to.

44:33.956 --> 44:37.373
- Could be worth millions.
- Or it could hurt so many.

44:38.375 --> 44:39.411
Yeah.

44:39.978 --> 44:41.693
You'll have to think about it.

44:42.618 --> 44:44.031
Thank you.

44:45.898 --> 44:47.132
It's hard.

44:47.797 --> 44:49.840
We don't need millions of dollars.

44:50.435 --> 44:53.241
My children need their father
and I need Harlan.

44:54.515 --> 44:55.990
I know. I'm sorry.

44:57.316 --> 44:59.313
What would he have done?

45:01.398 --> 45:02.743
I don't know.

45:05.278 --> 45:07.010
I really don't know.

45:12.528 --> 45:14.493
- All right, where is it?
- Where's what?

45:14.628 --> 45:16.223
Harlan Sendak's research.

45:16.317 --> 45:18.523
We don't come up with it,
you're going to be arrested.

45:18.605 --> 45:22.002
Your apartment is going to be searched.
Laura Sendak's house is going to be searched--

45:22.337 --> 45:24.072
- It's in my car. I--
- Go!

45:28.195 --> 45:31.142
You pull something like that again,
I'm not going to cover your ass.

45:31.346 --> 45:33.331
- I'm tired of this, David.
- Come on.

45:33.566 --> 45:37.841
I thought it was my petulant, irresponsible
behavior that you loved about me.

45:37.938 --> 45:40.871
Okay. Moving on.
Any more suicides?

45:41.027 --> 45:44.812
Yeah, two more further up the Mississippi
in a place called Greanville, Arkansas.

45:44.895 --> 45:46.662
They haven't had a suicide since 1981.

45:46.798 --> 45:49.370
Well, I think it's
time for a little field research.

45:49.517 --> 45:51.393
So do I, so pack your bags.

45:53.695 --> 45:55.500
Oh. Where is it?

45:55.788 --> 45:58.410
I put it in here this afternoon,
Caroline. I fucking swear.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.540
- David.
- I fucking swear.

46:09.496 --> 46:10.973
Yes, I understand.

46:12.918 --> 46:15.033
I'll have it sent
over to you immediately.

46:15.696 --> 46:16.772
No.

46:17.188 --> 46:19.053
No one has any idea
what happened to it.

46:21.966 --> 46:23.313
Thank you, sir.

46:35.785 --> 46:38.003
What do you think's
going on around here?

46:38.157 --> 46:40.393
Well Doc, I'll tell you.
This is Middle America.

46:40.538 --> 46:42.742
Folks around here
don't get the big city blues.

46:42.928 --> 46:45.732
We worry about the price of corn,
not terrorist attacks.

46:45.937 --> 46:49.010
Wes! I don't want excuses,
I don't want theories,

46:49.188 --> 46:51.192
I want to know
what happened to that research.

46:51.347 --> 46:53.340
I think we should sit down
and talk to David.

46:54.346 --> 46:56.092
I think that Connor McGuinn
would like that.

46:56.395 --> 46:58.801
That'll get you in
anywhere you want to go.

46:59.078 --> 47:00.943
Find what you're looking for
and let me know.

47:02.026 --> 47:03.672
I'm not the enemy.

47:04.015 --> 47:05.883
You think the water
might be poisoned?

47:06.015 --> 47:08.672
- Could be.
- You think that's what killed the deer?

47:09.138 --> 47:12.081
- Ahhh. Shit!
- Both victims had phorbols.

47:12.358 --> 47:14.131
McDonald had 4.85

47:14.226 --> 47:16.500
- and Deer has 6.7.
- You know that guy Deer?

47:16.635 --> 47:18.042
- Yeah.
- Is a deer.

47:18.187 --> 47:20.493
So, it's going to be
a reality show about me

47:20.658 --> 47:22.712
meeting superstars.
The rock stars are going to act like

47:22.805 --> 47:25.323
supermodels and the supermodels
like movie stars.

47:25.875 --> 47:27.240
I have crystal.

47:27.597 --> 47:29.900
Um... No. I clean these days.

47:30.075 --> 47:32.320
- Do you mind if I do?
- No, go ahead.

47:33.888 --> 47:35.363
Fuck! Fuck!

47:35.807 --> 47:37.570
- Aah.
- What is that?

47:37.747 --> 47:40.940
- Concentrated retrovirus in medium.
- Shower, now!

47:47.896 --> 47:50.821
The Asian Brown Cloud
was too close for comfort.

47:51.195 --> 47:53.192
I don't want ever
to have to do that again.
