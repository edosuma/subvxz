WEBVTT

00:00.383 --> 00:02.883
No, my mother was 
a wonderful cook.

00:03.317 --> 00:07.150
I can still remember 
coming downstairs.

00:07.238 --> 00:09.117
The aroma from the kitchen

00:09.150 --> 00:11.617
would just fill the...

00:12.167 --> 00:13.393
Is that a new watch?

00:13.866 --> 00:16.908
Oh, yeah, it is. 
It was actually a gift.

00:17.299 --> 00:18.366
From your wife?

00:18.661 --> 00:20.445
It's not your anniversary.

00:20.494 --> 00:25.061
No, no, it's not from my wife.
It's... not from my wife.

00:27.732 --> 00:30.599
- It's from a patient?
- Adrian, please, um...

00:30.787 --> 00:33.463
- So we were talking about your mother.
- Harold?

00:33.563 --> 00:36.578
Adrian, it's not important.
Now, you were talking about your mother.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.303
So what, he just gives you gifts?

00:38.812 --> 00:41.615
I didn't know patients
were allowed to do that.

00:42.059 --> 00:45.342
I'd be glad to give you something.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.792
- Adrian, it's really not necessary.
- I've thought about it.

00:47.826 --> 00:49.518
I've thought about it.

00:49.584 --> 00:52.545
A lot. I have. I mean, I...

00:52.579 --> 00:55.879
I wouldn't even be 
wherever it is I am

00:56.004 --> 00:57.621
without you, Dr. Kroger.

00:57.656 --> 00:59.980
- I mean, I'm grateful.
- Adrian.

00:59.996 --> 01:01.867
- I'm very grateful.
- Adrian.

01:01.974 --> 01:04.012
- Adrian.
- I wish I could think of...

01:04.077 --> 01:06.827
Adrian.
Don't buy me anything.

01:07.704 --> 01:10.183
It's really not appropriate
and it's very important,

01:10.216 --> 01:12.016
to me that you understand this.

01:13.859 --> 01:18.892
- Okay?
- So what are you, about a 42 regular?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.401 --> 01:30.177
I'm sorry. Um, your mother?

01:30.447 --> 01:33.538
Any meals
in particular that you might, uh...

01:33.572 --> 01:39.149
- You want to take that call?
- No, no. It's just Troy, my son.

01:40.137 --> 01:45.053
It's a message from his school.
He... didn't show up again.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.194
- Maybe he's sick.
- No, he's not sick.

01:47.998 --> 01:50.414
He's probably in some parking lot

01:50.448 --> 01:53.562
listening to trash metal music
and skateboarding with his friends.

01:53.595 --> 01:55.688
You know, the truth
is I'm at a loss here.

01:55.762 --> 01:59.368
I have been a therapist for 22 years.
I... I don't know what to do with him.

01:59.932 --> 02:00.984
Would you like me...

02:01.430 --> 02:02.730
to talk to the boy?

02:04.987 --> 02:05.987
No.

02:07.079 --> 02:08.145
No, thank you.

02:12.979 --> 02:14.979
Yes, I'm gonna get this one.

02:15.013 --> 02:16.530
I'm gonna get it. Hit it this time.

02:17.112 --> 02:19.820
I wanna see some mad air, bro.
I want to see you like this.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.443
- All right, here we go.
- Mad air!

02:25.125 --> 02:27.241
That was bitchin. Dude, wicked.

02:27.283 --> 02:30.599
Are you good?
Where's my board?

02:30.630 --> 02:33.299
- Oh, dude.
- Yeah, um...

02:33.755 --> 02:37.678
Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man.
I didn't mean for it to hit...

02:40.144 --> 02:43.239
- Whoa, are you okay?
- Yo, I think he's dead.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.647
- What?
- Excuse me.

02:45.776 --> 02:47.866
Hey, mister! Wake up!

02:54.191 --> 02:55.614
He is dead.

02:55.924 --> 02:56.924
What?

02:57.928 --> 03:00.391
- Yo, that's messed up, man.
- Oh, check this out.

03:01.789 --> 03:02.789
West Bay Trust?

03:03.663 --> 03:05.012
I bet they're from that robbery.

03:05.098 --> 03:07.266
What robbery?
It was all over the news, man.

03:07.298 --> 03:08.971
There was a big robbery yesterday.

03:09.003 --> 03:10.919
They got away with, like, $2 million.

03:11.532 --> 03:13.110
So where's the money?

03:13.537 --> 03:14.516
He buried it.

03:15.773 --> 03:16.773
How do you know?

03:19.144 --> 03:20.196
It's a treasure map.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.475
X marks the spot.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
6x06 - Mr. Monk and the Buried Treasure

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
www.sub-way.fr

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
- Synchro by:  ¤ AkaZab ¤

04:24.782 --> 04:26.401
- Okay, this is it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:27.056 --> 04:28.209
What if he wants a cut?

04:28.256 --> 04:30.624
I mean, we can't cut anyone
else in, man. This is our shot.

04:30.664 --> 04:31.911
This is our once in a lifetime.

04:31.943 --> 04:34.858
He's not gonna get a cut, okay?
We're not even gonna mention the money.

04:34.889 --> 04:37.185
- Weren't you listening?
- Uh...

04:37.556 --> 04:39.009
Okay, just let me do all the talking.

04:39.056 --> 04:40.397
Give me the map.
Where's the map?

04:40.432 --> 04:41.442
- Got it.
- Give me it.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.132
- What are you doing?
- Give me the map.

04:56.728 --> 04:57.897
It's a map.

04:57.929 --> 04:59.682
Yes, I can see that.

04:59.956 --> 05:01.977
And your English teacher drew this?

05:02.278 --> 05:04.361
Yeah,
we're all in the same class together.

05:04.378 --> 05:05.720
And we're reading Treasure Island.

05:05.751 --> 05:07.263
It's about pirates.

05:07.421 --> 05:09.016
I think it was written by a pirate.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.653
- Yeah.
- Totally.

05:10.876 --> 05:13.213
No, Robert Louis Stevenson.

05:13.587 --> 05:14.587
Not a pirate.

05:16.237 --> 05:18.116
See, we kinda messed up.

05:18.574 --> 05:20.026
We're flunking out of the class.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.755
The truth is we've been ditching school.

05:23.799 --> 05:27.004
Yes, your father mentioned that.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.713
What's with all this plastic?

05:28.811 --> 05:31.569
Oh, that couch is, um,

05:32.706 --> 05:34.569
what's the word? Mine.

05:34.616 --> 05:37.095
Okay, so this is, like, homework?

05:37.297 --> 05:38.297
Extra credit.

05:38.499 --> 05:40.756
You see, our teacher, Mr. Broderick,

05:41.043 --> 05:42.351
he's giving us one more chance.

05:42.399 --> 05:44.892
Yeah, see he drew this map
and said if we could

05:44.924 --> 05:47.024
follow it and find the X
like the pirates did

05:47.055 --> 05:49.036
in the book, then he wouldn't flunk us.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.401
Ew, did he bury something?

05:50.441 --> 05:53.528
- Oh, there's nothing buried.
- It's totally just a game.

05:53.575 --> 05:54.581
Extra credit.

05:54.617 --> 05:58.904
Yeah, he said all we have to do
is find the X and, uh, take a picture

05:59.638 --> 06:02.011
- with a camera.
- Yeah, we're telling you the truth.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.709
Right, I'm sure you are.

06:04.069 --> 06:05.626
Yeah, but it's in code or something.

06:05.627 --> 06:07.205
We can't really figure it out.

06:08.498 --> 06:12.071
So you want me
to help you decipher the map?

06:12.097 --> 06:13.107
Yes.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.665
Exactly, that's awesome.
Please, decipher the map.

06:15.950 --> 06:16.976
The only thing is,

06:17.008 --> 06:19.613
is you can't tell anybody
you're helping us. Not even my father.

06:19.692 --> 06:21.840
Is because we're supposed to be
doing it ourselves.

06:21.871 --> 06:25.128
Yeah, you can't tell anybody.
Even if they lock you up.

06:26.391 --> 06:28.285
Why... why would they lock us up?

06:32.105 --> 06:36.179
Would you excuse us for one minute.
We'll just be right back.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.944
Something is not right.
I don't trust them.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.655
- Why not?
- Because they're guys, teenage guys.

06:44.688 --> 06:46.915
So that automatically
means they're lying?

06:46.998 --> 06:48.115
Yes, it does.

06:48.431 --> 06:51.635
- Why else would they be here?
- I don't...

06:52.128 --> 06:54.543
Natalie, I can't say no.

06:54.861 --> 06:58.229
It's Dr. Kroger's kid.
The Doctor's always been there for me.

06:58.329 --> 07:01.515
Three times a week. Weekends. Holidays.

07:01.799 --> 07:04.626
I've been racking my brain trying
to figure out a way to pay him back.

07:04.731 --> 07:07.668
You made me... No. Ow.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.941
It's... testosterone.

07:11.842 --> 07:14.407
Get him. Get him. Ow.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.194
Hey, Troy, you gonna buy that map?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.172
We were thinking about it, Morris.

07:21.943 --> 07:24.383
So we figured "BBQ" means barbecue.

07:24.751 --> 07:26.156
That makes sense.

07:26.204 --> 07:29.227
Yeah, but we checked every barbecue in
town and there's none in that area.

07:29.259 --> 07:31.935
Plus, there's no zoo or Route 44.

07:36.361 --> 07:39.124
- I can't sell you these.
- Oh, wait, I have ID.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.606
There's no way you're 47.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.233
You can't prove I'm not.

07:45.654 --> 07:47.270
I'm in your homeroom, man.

07:48.775 --> 07:51.609
- So, wha... I can't buy beer here?
- No.

07:51.676 --> 07:53.950
- I'm totally 47.
- No.

07:53.981 --> 07:54.992
Elle Decor?

07:55.728 --> 07:57.181
It's a home magazine.

07:57.323 --> 07:58.711
You wouldn't be into it.

07:58.759 --> 07:59.759
I could be.

08:00.039 --> 08:01.365
I'm into lots of stuff.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.993
I got a corn snake who eats mice.

08:04.188 --> 08:06.093
I'm old enough to be your mother.

08:06.621 --> 08:07.621
But you're not.

08:07.868 --> 08:09.813
Hey, hey, guys.
Over here.

08:13.548 --> 08:15.491
Check this out,
we totally got something.

08:15.668 --> 08:17.294
- Mr. M.?
- Okay.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.725
I don't think this is "Route 44"

08:18.765 --> 08:21.259
because it's going north to south,

08:21.295 --> 08:24.453
and highways with even numbers
always go east to west.

08:25.053 --> 08:26.600
I think it's a mile marker.

08:26.689 --> 08:29.190
Didn't I tell you?
He's a genius.

08:29.284 --> 08:31.796
Look, this is the reservoir, right?

08:31.875 --> 08:35.412
So that means this is Old Lake Road,
mile marker 44.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.839
- Let's do it.
- All right, so we'll follow you.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.174
- No, no.
- Uh!

08:39.206 --> 08:40.596
Mr. Monk and I have to be together

08:40.628 --> 08:43.638
because he's the navigator.
So Ridley, you go with Natalie.

08:44.865 --> 08:48.516
Uh, yeah, whoa...
No, no, I will, uh...

08:48.547 --> 08:50.631
- Pez and Ridley, you guys take my car.
- Good idea.

08:50.632 --> 08:53.791
Wait, no, no. Um...

08:55.279 --> 08:56.793
Help me out...

09:30.134 --> 09:31.804
We had two bad guys in the bank.

09:32.597 --> 09:33.663
Guard shot one of them.

09:33.757 --> 09:36.480
Wasn't this guy. This is your basic,
no-frills heart attack.

09:36.789 --> 09:38.368
Guess that's one way to catch a crook.

09:38.525 --> 09:39.525
I'll take it.

09:39.649 --> 09:40.649
Where's the money?

09:40.897 --> 09:42.703
That's a good question.
Here's another one.

09:42.747 --> 09:45.802
Where's his partner?
Here's another one. Who is he?

09:45.833 --> 09:47.289
So far, he's John Doe.

09:47.405 --> 09:50.136
No wallet. No cell phone.
Somebody picked him clean.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.256
Probably his pal.

09:51.514 --> 09:54.075
Maybe.
Maybe some kids.

09:54.547 --> 09:56.123
- Kids?
- Yeah.

09:56.436 --> 09:59.023
Skateboarders.
They were here earlier today.

09:59.355 --> 10:02.292
We got a ramp.
We got skid marks.

10:02.439 --> 10:04.871
And we've got a scratch. It's fresh.

10:04.918 --> 10:07.944
- I'd say three, maybe four hours.
- Captain.

10:08.011 --> 10:10.245
- Yep?
- Store receipt from Aunt Boo's.

10:10.537 --> 10:13.659
Yeah, we know he went to Aunt Boo's,
Randy. We got wrappers all over the car.

10:13.709 --> 10:15.477
Yes, sir, I know. Uh, can I have it?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.151
- Can you have what?
- This.

10:18.780 --> 10:21.827
There's a contest.
It's like a promotional thing.

10:21.890 --> 10:24.353
Collect all the pieces,
you get free refills for life.

10:24.396 --> 10:26.767
I've been looking for this one
for six months.

10:27.639 --> 10:29.865
Ha, free refills for life.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.498
Captain.
Captain, I drink four of these a day.

10:34.672 --> 10:38.305
I live to be 100, that's, like,
a million dollars.

10:38.668 --> 10:40.911
Randy,
a security guard was shot and killed.

10:40.943 --> 10:43.596
- This is a homicide investigation.
- Yes, sir, I know.

10:44.192 --> 10:45.667
This coupon is three weeks old.

10:45.703 --> 10:48.345
CSI guys just cleared it.
It's not part of the case.

10:48.975 --> 10:51.185
Cap... Captain,
you're a spiritual person.

10:52.471 --> 10:54.093
I mean, you believe in God, right?

10:54.119 --> 10:56.645
I think this happened for a reason.

10:56.838 --> 10:58.969
Him dying, me finding this.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.706
What are you talking about?

11:02.517 --> 11:03.517
Circle of life.

11:04.389 --> 11:06.521
- That'sThe Lion King.
- Exactly.

11:06.571 --> 11:11.221
Except instead of a lion, it's me. And
instead of a baby cub, it's a Diet Coke.

11:13.687 --> 11:16.629
Randy, I'm gonna let you have
the receipt on one condition.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.693
You know what you just
said about the lion,

11:18.726 --> 11:20.477
and the baby cub, and the Diet Coke?

11:20.925 --> 11:23.901
You don't ever repeat that again
as long as I'm alive, understood?

11:25.292 --> 11:26.766
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.486
Blood.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.777
A lot of it.

11:35.964 --> 11:37.274
Soaked into the seat.

11:37.412 --> 11:38.944
There was a body back here.

12:03.485 --> 12:05.537
o/~ o/~ Hey, what's that mean,
"The Zoo"?

12:05.616 --> 12:08.456
I've got the map.
Just keep your eyes on the road.

12:08.582 --> 12:09.981
There's no zoo up here.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.166
Where's the freakin' zoo?

12:11.190 --> 12:14.238
- Blinker... blink... blinker.
- I never use my blinker.

12:14.854 --> 12:16.765
I don't like people
to know what I'm thinking.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.191
So your husband's deceased?

12:20.172 --> 12:21.783
He was a Navy pilot.

12:21.902 --> 12:24.493
- What happened?
- I'd really rather not talk about it.

12:24.525 --> 12:27.003
Did he crash?
I thought they had ejector seats.

12:27.035 --> 12:29.861
She said she doesn't
want to talk about it, nimrod.

12:31.010 --> 12:34.701
The point is, you're a single woman.
You're alone. That must be tough.

12:35.066 --> 12:36.296
I'm doing okay.

12:36.503 --> 12:39.909
Nat, this is me you're talking to.
Come on.

12:39.976 --> 12:43.904
Now, I know that you think
that I'm just a loser or a zero,

12:44.154 --> 12:46.239
but you never know. Things happen.

12:46.452 --> 12:49.057
I mean, I could
hit the lottery or something.

12:50.043 --> 12:52.389
Don't you have to be 18
to win the lottery?

12:52.788 --> 12:55.182
There are all different kinds
of lotteries.

12:55.410 --> 12:58.157
- Weird stuff happens all the time.
- You got that right.

12:58.219 --> 12:59.287
Yeah.

13:00.401 --> 13:02.085
Are you guys planning something?

13:02.206 --> 13:04.827
No, no, extra credit.

13:05.332 --> 13:08.000
Could we turn this down?

13:08.763 --> 13:09.895
It is down.

13:10.449 --> 13:13.149
Could we turn it down further?

13:13.575 --> 13:14.630
Down.

13:17.499 --> 13:19.656
So my dad talks about me
in the sessions?

13:19.710 --> 13:20.737
Sometimes.

13:21.618 --> 13:22.618
What does he say?

13:23.259 --> 13:24.827
Well, he's worried about you.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.410
Doesn't know why you're so angry.

13:27.483 --> 13:30.751
He wouldn't. He's impossible.
Have you ever tried talking to him?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.911
Yes, I have.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.152
Three times a week.

13:35.171 --> 13:37.590
No, you're paying him.
He has to talk to you.

13:37.618 --> 13:39.513
With me, it's like he doesn't even try.

13:39.575 --> 13:42.742
He just regurgitates that
psychobabble crap he learned in college.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.180
- Wanna hear something funny?
- No.

13:45.846 --> 13:48.487
When I was a kid, guess what I
wanted to be.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.193
A shrink like my old man.

13:51.382 --> 13:52.382
Maybe you will.

13:53.683 --> 13:55.956
Yeah, or maybe I won't
have to work at all.

13:57.298 --> 14:00.055
Anyway, next time you're in session,
tell him I said hi.

14:00.104 --> 14:02.141
Troy, pull over. Pull over.

14:08.278 --> 14:11.404
It's not a "Z." It's a "2."

14:11.674 --> 14:13.095
The 200.

14:13.363 --> 14:15.363
That means we take the next left...

14:15.410 --> 14:18.153
Yes, it's gonna happen. I can feel it.

14:18.154 --> 14:19.660
I can smell it.

14:20.701 --> 14:23.625
- Dude, this is it.
- No, thank you.

14:23.916 --> 14:24.958
Let's do it.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.747
You okay? If you need anything,
you let me know, all right.

14:36.218 --> 14:38.221
I'm fine. It's not at bad as it looks.

14:38.441 --> 14:39.641
Mr. Connelly.

14:39.931 --> 14:41.952
Karen, you didn't need to come in today.

14:41.984 --> 14:44.369
I know, I just...
I didn't want to be alone.

14:44.432 --> 14:47.800
Well... I'm glad you're here. Any calls?

14:47.917 --> 14:48.917
Uh, the police.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.459
Detectives keep calling.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.992
- Anybody else?
- Nope, that's it.

14:53.039 --> 14:54.041
Okay.

14:54.088 --> 14:55.304
- Thanks.
- bye.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.472
- We are. We're facing north, right?
- Right.

15:00.013 --> 15:01.618
There's the reservoir.

15:02.590 --> 15:06.079
Supposed to be a barbeque over there?

15:06.576 --> 15:09.171
Barbeque, that doesn't make any sense.

15:11.629 --> 15:13.102
How old do you think she is?

15:14.811 --> 15:16.663
I don't know, 34 maybe.

15:17.844 --> 15:18.981
That's twice my age.

15:19.696 --> 15:24.559
So when you're 60, she'll be 120.

15:28.913 --> 15:30.334
Where'd you get that phone?

15:30.718 --> 15:32.604
- From the guy.
- The dead guy?

15:32.666 --> 15:34.779
- What, he's not using it.
- Don't answer that.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.660
What are you doing?
No, stop!

15:36.856 --> 15:39.722
Don't answer that, don't answer that.
No, come one!

15:44.329 --> 15:46.587
You were supposed to call.
Where the hell you been?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.420
Sorry, bad connection.

15:49.447 --> 15:51.576
So how'd it go?
Did you bury our little package?

15:51.675 --> 15:53.553
Yeah, yeah, I buried the package.

15:53.632 --> 15:57.319
I just hope I found the right place.
Look, if you could just remind me

15:57.382 --> 15:58.867
where exactly, uh...

15:58.923 --> 16:00.817
Who is this?

16:01.581 --> 16:03.143
This is your new partner, nimrod.

16:03.175 --> 16:04.185
Where's Tony?

16:04.217 --> 16:06.806
Look, don't worry about Tony.
You got other stuff to worry about.

16:06.838 --> 16:08.383
- We got the map.
- The map?

16:08.423 --> 16:09.434
That's right.

16:09.465 --> 16:12.923
And sooner or later we're gonna
find where the money is.

16:13.011 --> 16:15.032
But if you want to save us some time,

16:15.093 --> 16:17.401
we might be willing to cut you in.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.459
What happened?

16:22.891 --> 16:23.896
Yo, he hung up.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.324
Bro...

16:28.015 --> 16:29.878
- What is that, number three?
- It's four.

16:30.435 --> 16:32.298
Used to pay $3.50 for these.

16:32.675 --> 16:34.570
And you're still single. Go figure.

16:34.856 --> 16:36.529
At some point,
I'm gonna need a bathroom.

16:36.593 --> 16:38.472
No kidding.
Steven Connelly.

16:38.614 --> 16:42.570
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD.
This is Lieutenant Disher. Got a minute?

16:43.517 --> 16:45.438
Just spent three hours with the FBI.

16:45.644 --> 16:46.977
It's been kind of a rough day.

16:47.017 --> 16:49.205
And I appreciate that, sir.
This won't take long.

16:49.293 --> 16:51.391
Something's come up.
That's Jack Connelly.

16:52.323 --> 16:53.776
You remember him?

16:54.467 --> 16:56.300
Happy Jack Connelly. He's your brother?

16:56.399 --> 16:57.399
Don't remind me.

16:58.065 --> 16:59.376
Do you recognize him?

17:00.704 --> 17:01.703
No.

17:01.728 --> 17:03.488
- No, was he one of them?
- You tell us.

17:03.513 --> 17:04.862
You got the best look at them.

17:05.199 --> 17:08.131
Uh, I was pretty busy opening the safe.

17:08.534 --> 17:09.623
Getting beat up.

17:10.126 --> 17:13.236
- Besides, they were wearing masks.
- I think that's it.

17:13.939 --> 17:15.218
Was he the one that was shot?

17:15.742 --> 17:20.397
No, he died of a heart attack. He found
him in a parking lot in pacific heights.

17:21.243 --> 17:23.435
- I'm sorry I can't help you.
- Oh, I think that's it.

17:23.486 --> 17:24.961
Can you think of anything else?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.375
Anything at all?

17:34.588 --> 17:36.640
Okay, if you do, please give me a call.

17:36.835 --> 17:38.521
- Absolutely.
- I have a question.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.704
Where's your bathroom?

17:39.749 --> 17:41.644
It's in the lobby,
but it's out of order.

17:41.817 --> 17:43.396
Do you have another one for executives?

17:43.441 --> 17:45.762
No, we've been using the one
in the deli around the block.

17:46.194 --> 17:47.441
No further questions.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.051
Captain, I'll meet you out front.

18:05.976 --> 18:06.976
It's 5:30.

18:07.475 --> 18:08.475
What are we doing?

18:08.847 --> 18:09.952
Let's just forget it.

18:12.546 --> 18:14.157
Wanna go behind that tree and make out?

18:14.330 --> 18:16.227
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout that tree?

18:16.401 --> 18:17.411
No, thanks.

18:17.771 --> 18:18.887
Sorry, you guys.

18:19.643 --> 18:22.451
I tried. I really... I really did.

18:23.043 --> 18:24.306
Seem to have hit a wall.

18:25.758 --> 18:27.958
Maybe if I just talked to your teacher.

18:28.042 --> 18:31.373
- No. That's okay.
- That won't be necessary.

18:31.984 --> 18:32.994
What?

18:39.673 --> 18:41.257
It's not a barbeque.

18:41.775 --> 18:42.944
BBQ.

18:44.351 --> 18:45.877
It's a quarry.

18:52.521 --> 18:55.553
Troy There it is, I see it. It's a big
X straight ahead. Do you see it?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.938
- There it is.
- Awesome, man.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.375
Cha-ching.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.852
Wow, this is really
going to increase our GPA.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.265
Yeah, definitely.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.164
Listen, thanks a lot, man.

19:07.316 --> 19:09.596
Everything my dad said
about you is totally true.

19:09.801 --> 19:12.659
Not just the weird stuff,
but the good stuff too.

19:13.123 --> 19:15.065
Everything he said
about you is true too.

19:15.865 --> 19:16.865
Don't forget that.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.169
So you guys probably want to go home.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

19:23.301 --> 19:24.311
Let's go.

19:24.501 --> 19:27.074
Wait, wait, don't you
want to get a picture?

19:28.658 --> 19:29.584
Oh right.

19:40.984 --> 19:43.036
You guys, come on, the money
will still be there.

19:43.445 --> 19:44.445
Come on.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.018
Boy, you're in a good mood.

20:08.436 --> 20:10.261
Just finished a big case.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.084
Well, then, it must have gone well.

20:13.615 --> 20:15.047
You could say that.

20:15.944 --> 20:17.444
Oh, it sounds interesting.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.684
Wasn't a big case.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.275
But in same ways, it was...

20:22.537 --> 20:24.805
the most important case of my career.

20:27.248 --> 20:30.174
- Well, I am intrigued.
- I'll bet you are.

20:30.765 --> 20:33.260
Well, was it, what, for the city?

20:33.407 --> 20:35.981
No. It was a private client.

20:37.628 --> 20:41.387
It was a chance to help a friend
of mine, a very dear friend.

20:42.456 --> 20:44.251
I'm sure he appreciates it.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.678
He doesn't even know about it.
And I'm not gonna tell him.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.868
I don't want him to feel indebted.

20:49.904 --> 20:53.236
See, now that is the purest form
of charity.

20:53.263 --> 20:57.185
You know, to help someone
and not take any credit.

20:59.666 --> 21:01.539
- What?
- Nothing, it's...

21:02.625 --> 21:04.489
How's Troy doing?

21:05.811 --> 21:08.401
He's much better. Thank you for asking.

21:08.589 --> 21:10.115
You know, he...

21:10.415 --> 21:14.047
He came downstairs
this morning whistling.

21:15.391 --> 21:18.509
Opens up the curtains and says,
"What a beautiful day. "

21:18.520 --> 21:19.977
I said, "Is that my son?"

21:22.111 --> 21:24.747
Sounds like he has a whole new attitude.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.663
I think his schoolwork is gonna
start improving too.

21:28.695 --> 21:32.069
- Yeah, well, I hope you're right.
- I know I'm right.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.276
- Well, I hope so.
- I know so.

21:39.228 --> 21:40.264
Time will tell.

21:40.359 --> 21:43.007
Yes.
It will.

21:48.588 --> 21:51.540
We hit a wall on that
West Bay Trust robbery.

21:51.988 --> 21:54.278
I wanted to run
a couple of things by you.

21:55.390 --> 21:58.649
We could have done this yesterday,
but you were on your little road trip.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.860
What was that about?

21:59.924 --> 22:02.434
I was helping Dr. Kroger's kid
with his homework.

22:02.505 --> 22:03.505
Who, Troy?

22:03.610 --> 22:07.427
Yeah, the boy needs a role model,
somebody to look up to.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.086
What, you're gonna help him find one?

22:09.179 --> 22:11.889
Actually, Mr. Monk
did a great job yesterday.

22:11.927 --> 22:14.337
He was like a big brother.
You would have been proud of him.

22:15.980 --> 22:16.980
Excuse me.

22:21.948 --> 22:23.054
Let's do this.

22:23.181 --> 22:25.629
We've got surveillance video
from the bank.

22:29.892 --> 22:31.024
There we go.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.115
Wednesday. 9:18 in the morning.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.162
Two Caucasian males enter
the Vinton Street branch.

22:37.194 --> 22:40.129
They pistol-whip Steven Connelly,
the assistant branch manager.

22:40.145 --> 22:41.572
Yeah, and guess who his brother is.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.054
Happy Jack Connelly.

22:43.230 --> 22:44.367
Remember him? Uh-huh.

22:44.717 --> 22:48.569
9:21. It all hits the fan.
Security guard gets off one round.

22:48.664 --> 22:52.203
This guy, the guy in the green ski mask
is hit, we think in the chest.

22:52.314 --> 22:55.617
They kill the security guard.
Grab the cash.

22:55.677 --> 22:57.303
Two minutes later, they're gone.

22:58.464 --> 23:03.282
Yesterday, Thursday, we find one
of them in a parking lot dead as dust.

23:03.331 --> 23:06.005
- From the gunshot?
- Nope, this is the other guy.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.727
Mr. Black Ski Mask.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.143
It was a heart attack,
one cheeseburger too many.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.114
We found blood in the backseat.
No body. No footprints.

23:13.145 --> 23:14.172
And no money.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.802
- Double cross?
- Maybe.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.877
Or somebody else found him.
Could have been some kids,

23:19.903 --> 23:21.466
hanging out, skateboarding.

23:25.587 --> 23:26.624
We traced the car.

23:27.129 --> 23:29.701
Mr. Black's name was Tony Gammalobo.

23:29.764 --> 23:32.920
Single. 47 years old.
Lives in Daly City.

23:35.934 --> 23:38.310
Did four years in Arizona. Ring a bell?

23:43.695 --> 23:45.353
He was 47?

23:45.465 --> 23:47.054
There's no way you're 47.

23:47.161 --> 23:48.534
I'm totally 47.

23:51.157 --> 23:53.163
You... you said there were kids.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.084
It's possible. We're checking it out.

23:55.154 --> 23:56.630
Whoever it was, they cleaned him out.

23:56.655 --> 23:58.430
They got his cell phone,
wallet, everything.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.661
What kind of cell phone?

23:59.732 --> 24:02.793
It was a... We found the charger.

24:07.215 --> 24:08.541
Yeah, it was a Motorola.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.388
What... what do they look like?

24:11.483 --> 24:14.107
I've got the same model.
It's in my pocket.

24:21.354 --> 24:22.444
You okay?

24:27.579 --> 24:29.269
I... I just remembered something.

24:30.446 --> 24:32.050
- I have to go.
- You're leaving?

24:32.140 --> 24:34.642
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I have to talk to Troy about something.

24:34.736 --> 24:37.633
- Well, I'll go with you.
- No, no...

24:37.817 --> 24:41.256
This is between me and him.
You... you stay here. I'll call you.

24:45.347 --> 24:47.258
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.256
I don't care. Free refills for life.

25:08.651 --> 25:09.893
Pretty sweet, huh?

25:13.697 --> 25:15.802
No, you got to bite the end off, nimrod.

25:16.382 --> 25:17.734
Dude, this is awesome.

25:18.621 --> 25:19.753
Oh, hey, Mr. M.

25:25.928 --> 25:26.949
What's the name

25:26.981 --> 25:29.317
- of the pirate inTreasure Island?
- Excuse me?

25:29.333 --> 25:32.507
Tell me one thing aboutTreasure Island.

25:33.292 --> 25:34.713
You never read it, did you?

25:34.914 --> 25:36.556
There was no assignment.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.433
Where did you get the map?

25:38.659 --> 25:40.038
Listen, let's just relax, okay?

25:40.070 --> 25:44.360
You found it in a car next to a body.
This is not a game.

25:44.898 --> 25:45.898
Troy.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.504
A man was killed in that bank.
Hey, man, we can explain.

25:49.579 --> 25:50.579
Yeah.

25:51.262 --> 25:52.262
Go ahead.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.538
Not now, I mean, we need a few days.

25:57.340 --> 26:00.122
- Are you gonna tell the cops?
- I don't have to tell the cops.

26:00.181 --> 26:01.239
lamthe cops.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.154
Mr. Monk, please,
you can't tell my father.

26:03.185 --> 26:06.137
I mean, you know what this will
do to him. It'll break his heart.

26:07.011 --> 26:09.971
Oh, God, it will break his heart.
Okay, okay. Let me think.

26:11.302 --> 26:13.371
- Where's the money?
- In my trunk.

26:14.850 --> 26:17.589
All right, I have an idea.
We're gonna go back to that quarry.

26:17.624 --> 26:20.019
Oh, I can't go back there.
I'm supposed to be...

26:20.051 --> 26:22.618
Not you. Just me and Troy.

26:22.899 --> 26:26.713
I have to know exactly where you found
that money. Show me everything you did.

26:26.777 --> 26:29.356
Then I'll take the map and the cash
to Captain Stottlemeyer.

26:29.768 --> 26:32.358
Maybe there's a way
to keep your name out of it.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.466
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

26:39.540 --> 26:40.624
No, it wasn't.

26:56.859 --> 26:58.706
Take me through it one more time.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.112
We got here at around midnight,
maybe 12:30.

27:03.397 --> 27:04.923
We parked the car over there.

27:04.997 --> 27:07.966
We saw the red X and we started digging.

27:11.098 --> 27:12.361
Can you see okay?

27:12.695 --> 27:14.482
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

27:14.692 --> 27:16.973
Look, it's just gravel.
It's not gonna kill you.

27:20.182 --> 27:21.265
Gravel, yeah...

27:23.888 --> 27:26.036
I'm fine. Thank you, Troy.

27:27.115 --> 27:29.215
But that is not the right place.

27:29.305 --> 27:33.015
According to the map,
it should have been over there.

27:33.277 --> 27:34.651
In line with that shed.

27:34.683 --> 27:37.486
Yeah, but the X was here,
so we dug here.

27:38.465 --> 27:39.465
Think about it.

27:39.653 --> 27:42.084
Why would they bury $2 million

27:42.147 --> 27:45.147
and then leave
a giant X marking the spot?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.515
They're bank robbers.

27:46.642 --> 27:48.022
That doesn't make any sense.

27:48.071 --> 27:49.470
There wasn't $2 million

27:49.495 --> 27:51.895
when we dug that hole.
We only pulled out, like, five grand.

27:51.942 --> 27:53.934
$5,000?
Are you sure?

27:54.192 --> 27:56.587
Yeah, we counted it,
like, a hundred times.

27:56.839 --> 27:59.745
We figured that the bank just said that
to rip off the insurance company.

27:59.855 --> 28:00.866
Everybody does it.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.413
Yeah, like, when my house got robbed,

28:02.445 --> 28:04.426
my dad said we had
a rare coin collection.

28:05.121 --> 28:06.131
He did?

28:22.505 --> 28:23.610
What is that?

28:25.062 --> 28:26.482
What is that back there?

28:28.558 --> 28:29.558
It's a hole.

28:30.116 --> 28:31.116
Like a pit.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.313
No, no, no, behind you.

28:33.548 --> 28:34.548
Over... over here.

28:37.231 --> 28:38.231
It's a ski mask.

28:48.150 --> 28:49.150
Troy.

28:49.648 --> 28:51.016
Troy, get back in the car.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.511
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Wait, why?

28:53.558 --> 28:55.453
We gotta go, come on.
Come on, we gotta go.

28:56.886 --> 28:58.948
- I think we were followed.
- Okay.

28:59.048 --> 29:00.485
- Let's go.
- I'm going.

29:11.294 --> 29:13.542
Let's go. Make it go. It's not going.

29:17.707 --> 29:19.128
Make it go.
Make it go.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.628
Trying to make it go.

29:22.660 --> 29:24.984
- It stalled.
- Make it start. Make it start.

29:31.808 --> 29:33.355
What are you doing?

29:33.466 --> 29:34.650
Oh, my gosh.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.580
Back it up. I can't.

29:42.566 --> 29:44.414
- What... what happened?
- Where'd it go?

29:44.475 --> 29:45.792
- I don't know.
- Where'd it go?

29:45.835 --> 29:48.187
Try to back up. Okay, okay.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.450
It's done. It's not...
it's not working. It's not working.

29:51.481 --> 29:53.352
- Let's go.
- We're stuck.

29:53.903 --> 29:56.588
We're stuck in here. Come on.

30:01.889 --> 30:02.889
Wait, wait.

30:05.989 --> 30:07.220
Look.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.764
What time is it?

31:10.440 --> 31:14.072
Oh, my God.

31:16.087 --> 31:17.755
Is that AM or PM?

31:19.097 --> 31:22.649
- AM.
- Oh, my God.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.161
I'm gonna get out and push.

31:48.942 --> 31:50.468
It's locked.

31:51.589 --> 31:53.631
It's not locked, Mr. Monk.

31:58.246 --> 31:59.393
Stop!

32:00.077 --> 32:01.077
Troy.

32:02.349 --> 32:03.486
Unlock the door.

32:03.570 --> 32:07.586
The door isn't locked, Mr. Monk.
I've told you a thousand times.

32:11.093 --> 32:14.425
Troy, I am not joking around.

32:14.715 --> 32:18.044
Listen, let's just take it easy.
Okay, Mr. Monk?

32:20.586 --> 32:23.823
Mr. Monk, just keep it together.

32:24.662 --> 32:25.714
We're gonna be okay.

32:29.033 --> 32:30.033
Cell phone.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.475
- Cell phone.
- I already checked.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.211
Like, four hours ago. There's no signal.

32:35.232 --> 32:38.029
Try the other one.
The.. the one you took off of Gammalobo.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.192
Who? Bank robber!
The dead guy, dead guy, bank robber.

32:45.313 --> 32:47.301
- Nothing.
- Push all the buttons.

32:47.359 --> 32:49.017
Cause you're not
hitting all the buttons.

32:51.808 --> 32:54.192
What... what is this?

32:55.452 --> 32:56.552
Calls he received.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.048
Jack Connelly.

32:58.459 --> 32:59.817
And Steven Connelly?

33:00.850 --> 33:01.939
Four, five...

33:03.663 --> 33:05.168
Calls from the bank.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.132
From the bank.

33:12.148 --> 33:13.737
Oh, my God.

33:16.027 --> 33:17.143
What?

33:18.344 --> 33:21.802
Troy, I know what happened.

33:23.943 --> 33:24.943
Yay.

33:26.876 --> 33:30.165
I just... solved the case.

33:33.117 --> 33:34.506
Bro, that game's pretty tough.

33:35.198 --> 33:36.374
I can figure it out.

33:36.411 --> 33:39.542
- Hey, I was just thinking about you.
- Well, don't. I mean it, Ridley.

33:39.587 --> 33:40.818
Well, you can't stop somebody

33:40.861 --> 33:44.390
- from thinking about somebody.
- Yes I can. Don't think about me again.

33:44.421 --> 33:46.580
Now, where is Mr. Monk?
He hasn't been home all night.

33:46.613 --> 33:48.405
- Didn't he tell you?
- Tell me what?

34:04.435 --> 34:06.451
Maybe we should conserve the battery.

34:06.912 --> 34:10.106
No, no, no, no!

34:10.152 --> 34:13.469
All right, we'll keep the lights on.
Ah! Stop!

34:14.590 --> 34:16.437
Mr. Monk, try...

34:16.484 --> 34:20.219
Mr. Monk, try not to think
about where we are.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.507
Concentrate on something else.

34:23.766 --> 34:26.339
You solved the case, right?
You said you solved the case?

34:27.779 --> 34:29.147
Well, talk to me about it.

34:29.713 --> 34:31.376
Yeah, tell me about the case.

34:31.907 --> 34:33.565
There was a bank robbery.

34:34.393 --> 34:35.393
It was a...

34:36.202 --> 34:37.954
It was an inside job.

34:39.321 --> 34:43.768
The branch manager, Connelly,
must have masterminded the whole thing.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.846
It was him, Tony Gammalobo,

34:47.186 --> 34:49.038
and Connelly's brother, Jack.

34:49.429 --> 34:51.119
He made sure they beat him up,

34:51.717 --> 34:53.533
so nobody would suspect him.

34:54.107 --> 34:58.157
Then it went wrong.
Connolly's brother was shot.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.503
Must have died a few hours later.

35:01.257 --> 35:03.973
Connelly had a problem.
He had to get rid of the body.

35:04.052 --> 35:06.925
If the cops found it,
they'd identify him.

35:07.143 --> 35:11.059
They'd know it was his brother.
They'd know it was an inside job.

35:13.830 --> 35:15.446
This wasn't the treasure map.

35:16.574 --> 35:19.578
This was where Connelly
wanted his brother buried.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.912
There was money, $5,000.

35:23.069 --> 35:27.186
Connelly put that money there later.
He wanted you to find it.

35:27.619 --> 35:30.713
He didn't have time
to dig up his brother.

35:31.116 --> 35:34.653
He made a big X and buried a few bucks.

35:35.017 --> 35:38.928
He figured if you found
any amount of money, you'd be satisfied.

35:39.361 --> 35:42.740
You'd stop looking around
and just go home.

35:44.281 --> 35:45.480
So what do we do now?

35:46.278 --> 35:51.349
I don't know... about you, but I plan
on suffocating.

36:04.479 --> 36:05.437
Mr. Monk.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.558
Mr. Monk, look at me.

36:10.802 --> 36:11.802
Look at me!

36:13.300 --> 36:14.405
You're gonna be okay.

36:17.061 --> 36:18.214
I know, let's play a game.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.376
Yeah, you and me are gonna
play a game, Mr. Monk.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.528
20 Questions. You can think of anything.

36:24.905 --> 36:26.645
Any word you want. Anything.

36:26.898 --> 36:29.408
Animal, vegetable, mineral, anything.

36:32.141 --> 36:33.141
Mineral.

36:34.588 --> 36:35.898
It's a mineral.

36:36.198 --> 36:38.710
- Is it gravel?
- Yes, it's gravel!

36:39.253 --> 36:40.784
It's gravel.

36:41.576 --> 36:42.634
Gravel!

36:43.042 --> 36:44.605
It's gravel!

36:45.414 --> 36:48.556
It's gravel, okay?
Gravel!

36:48.829 --> 36:51.198
It's everywhere.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.930
And he was coming back here?

36:54.670 --> 36:55.827
That's what they said.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.363
Well, he's not here now.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.272
Must have gone home.

37:04.410 --> 37:05.673
Let's go.

37:10.910 --> 37:13.073
Okay, come on, keep going.

37:14.512 --> 37:15.675
March 2nd.

37:16.695 --> 37:18.028
1967.

37:20.448 --> 37:21.758
It was partly cloudy.

37:23.122 --> 37:25.705
They said it was supposed to rain,

37:27.695 --> 37:28.737
but it never did.

37:29.178 --> 37:31.909
Good. You're doing great.
So, okay, next day?

37:33.744 --> 37:34.786
March 3rd.

37:36.131 --> 37:37.346
1967.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.105
It was sunny.

37:43.964 --> 37:45.474
Wait, listen. No, no...

37:45.529 --> 37:46.719
Windy. No.

37:48.137 --> 37:49.195
It's a car.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.109
- Down!
- Here!

38:00.134 --> 38:01.768
- Somebody!
- Help!

38:03.639 --> 38:05.757
Cap, they stop the car.

38:06.127 --> 38:08.369
- I should pee.
- Again?

38:08.421 --> 38:09.609
Sorry, gotta go.

38:11.524 --> 38:13.194
- We're down here!
- Somebody!

38:13.242 --> 38:14.231
Help us.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.216
I told you to go at the filling station.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.622
Down here!

38:27.638 --> 38:29.955
- Somebody help, come on.
- Hey!

38:30.050 --> 38:31.950
Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea.

38:32.663 --> 38:33.642
What...

38:33.888 --> 38:35.020
What are you doing?

38:35.189 --> 38:36.257
- Trust me.
- Help!

38:36.319 --> 38:40.625
I've got two 12inch subwoofers and 1,600
watts worth of power back there, man.

38:40.676 --> 38:42.318
I'm gonna blow this thing up.

38:42.434 --> 38:43.434
Yes.

38:43.557 --> 38:45.451
No... oh, no, please, God, no.

38:45.562 --> 38:46.904
No, not that crap.

38:47.056 --> 38:48.582
Don't you have anything else?

38:48.683 --> 38:49.839
- This'll be good.
- Oh, no.

38:53.471 --> 38:55.066
Hurry up.

38:55.684 --> 38:57.042
Much better.

39:20.728 --> 39:21.812
What are you doing?

39:22.785 --> 39:23.811
You hear that?

39:23.858 --> 39:25.390
- Hear what?
- Turn the car off.

39:35.973 --> 39:37.350
Come here. Do you hear that?

39:51.698 --> 39:52.861
I know that song.

39:54.632 --> 39:55.789
Oh, my God, it's Troy.

39:56.566 --> 39:57.570
Down there.

39:58.269 --> 40:01.492
Randy, call it in. Call it in.

40:01.559 --> 40:04.362
Get a crane down here.
We're gonna need some paramedics.

40:05.141 --> 40:06.178
Monk.

40:06.433 --> 40:07.602
Monk, we're coming.

40:07.676 --> 40:09.034
Come on!

40:09.733 --> 40:10.733
Down here!

40:14.527 --> 40:16.548
You can turn off the music now.

40:16.841 --> 40:19.024
It is off.
It's been off for over an hour.

40:19.055 --> 40:21.767
That's what I'm saying,
I can still hear it. It's terrible.

40:21.837 --> 40:24.052
Oh, Mr. Monk,
that music saved your life.

40:24.084 --> 40:26.136
I'm not going to lie, Randy.

40:26.517 --> 40:28.253
Can't you just say I had a hunch?

40:28.576 --> 40:30.525
But you didn't have a hunch.
You had to pee,

40:30.561 --> 40:32.309
and that's what
I'm putting in my report.

40:32.883 --> 40:35.426
- How's he doing?
- Doing just fine.

40:37.689 --> 40:39.215
Feds just picked up Connelly.

40:39.265 --> 40:41.181
He already coughed up the money.

40:41.994 --> 40:43.047
Good job.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.703
How's Troy doing?

40:46.750 --> 40:50.853
He's great. He's great. He said he
changed his mind about going to college.

40:50.885 --> 40:54.493
He said that he might actually
want to study psychology.

40:54.597 --> 40:55.597
Ha.

41:04.396 --> 41:06.333
So how you doing?

41:06.394 --> 41:07.983
Uh, yeah, uh...

41:08.014 --> 41:09.626
What happened down there?

41:10.261 --> 41:12.108
I had a little talk with the boy.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.231
Heart to heart.

41:14.886 --> 41:18.028
It's important to listen.

41:18.498 --> 41:21.572
That's... that's really
the main thing, listening.

41:21.621 --> 41:23.488
No, listening, listening is good.

41:23.531 --> 41:24.542
Listening.

41:25.698 --> 41:28.271
Whatever you did, Adrian, thank you.

41:28.689 --> 41:30.758
You gave our family a wonderful gift.

41:32.479 --> 41:33.826
Better than a watch?

41:36.164 --> 41:38.299
- Better than a wristwatch.
- Mention that to Harold.

41:38.420 --> 41:40.720
- I don't think that's appropriate.
- Call him right now.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.501
Natalie, where's your phone?

41:42.533 --> 41:44.356
Here, sit down.
Why do you have his number?

41:44.388 --> 41:45.690
I mean, a watch, give me a break.

41:45.752 --> 41:49.286
Did I ever say
to you that it was Harold?

41:49.311 --> 41:51.611
I never said it was Harold.
No, do not call !

41:51.813 --> 41:55.130
Adrian, sit down, just sit down…
