WEBVTT

00:01.572 --> 00:02.772
I'm Sheila temple,

00:02.773 --> 00:06.036
and welcome to the
"temple of justice."

00:06.037 --> 00:07.707
Hillary stone was released from prison
today... (Crowd shouting indistinctly)

00:07.708 --> 00:11.181
Get back. Get back. After she
was acquitted by judge Joan hunt...

00:11.182 --> 00:13.083
Move! Move! Of the brutal
and senseless murder

00:13.084 --> 00:15.715
of her own 5-year-old son Simon.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.118
And today, she's a free woman.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.190
Free to kill again.

00:20.191 --> 00:22.223
You guys need to back
up off the car! Stay tuned.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.628
(Thunder rumbles)

00:28.629 --> 00:30.360
(Lightning cracks)

00:30.361 --> 00:33.133
(Rainfall)

00:33.134 --> 00:34.664
(Lightning cracks)

00:34.665 --> 00:37.668
(Thunder rumbling)

00:46.247 --> 00:49.319
(Lightning cracks)

00:49.320 --> 00:51.322
(Crack)

00:58.729 --> 01:02.462
Are you trying to create
a circus atmosphere?

01:02.463 --> 01:04.294
Rain is still in the forecast.

01:04.295 --> 01:07.597
And it will preserve the
scene if the skies open up.

01:07.598 --> 01:09.099
Where's your better half?

01:09.100 --> 01:11.101
Sam's in Harrisburg
at a wedding.

01:11.102 --> 01:12.272
It's really too bad.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.073
You know how much
she loves the big top.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.246
Rain stopped at 2:00 A.M.

01:16.247 --> 01:19.609
Jogger cutting through the
site found the body at, uh...

01:19.610 --> 01:21.111
7:30.

01:21.112 --> 01:23.853
And how did you know that?

01:23.854 --> 01:26.516
The sun has been up
long enough to cake the dirt,

01:26.517 --> 01:29.259
but the work shift
hadn't started yet.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.362
That puts discovery at
about an hour after sunrise.

01:32.363 --> 01:34.124
Got blood on the backhoe.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.826
So the victim probably
hit their head on it

01:36.827 --> 01:39.169
and then fell in the hole
that it dug the day before.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.470
All right. Let's dig him up.

01:40.471 --> 01:43.333
We don't dig, detective.

01:43.334 --> 01:45.576
We excavate.

01:48.839 --> 01:52.143
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:55.786 --> 01:58.618
Oh, god.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.220
That's Hillary stone.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.121
I don't think anybody's gonna
want to solve this murder.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.194
May I remind you,
she was acquitted?

02:04.195 --> 02:05.625
That doesn't make her innocent.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.697
People saw her on that bridge,

02:07.698 --> 02:09.699
they saw her drop
the sack into the river.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.261
Come on. You know she did it.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.762
All I know is, someone did this.

02:12.763 --> 02:15.735
That's my only concern.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.267
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:17.268 --> 02:18.739
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:20.471 --> 02:22.512
I'm Sheila temple
from "temple of justice."

02:22.513 --> 02:25.415
In a shocking
turn, Hillary stone,

02:25.416 --> 02:27.717
who yesterday was a free woman,

02:27.718 --> 02:30.320
is now a dead woman.

02:30.321 --> 02:31.481
We are here at
the construction site

02:31.482 --> 02:33.152
where the body is
now being uncovered.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.327
And our chief medical examiner
has just arrived on the scene.

02:37.328 --> 02:39.489
Dr. Murphy, Dr. Murphy,

02:39.490 --> 02:41.391
care to comment? No.

02:41.392 --> 02:42.792
Not even about your
choice of medical examiner?

02:42.793 --> 02:44.934
Dr. Hunt is the
best our office has.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.266
Isn't that the same thing

02:46.267 --> 02:47.637
that the mayor said
about her mother...

02:47.638 --> 02:49.739
Judge Joan hunt?

02:49.740 --> 02:51.441
(Indistinct conversations)

02:51.442 --> 02:55.405
This is gonna be gold.
This is gonna be gold.

02:55.406 --> 02:56.576
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:56.577 --> 02:59.409
Oh, and here come
the news choppers.

02:59.410 --> 03:02.352
Choppers and an accused
murderer under the big top...

03:02.353 --> 03:04.254
Still think this isn't a circus?

03:04.255 --> 03:06.756
I've got lesions at the
frontotemporal region.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.818
So c.O.D. Could be
subdural hematoma.

03:08.819 --> 03:10.820
There's also patterned
bruising around the neck,

03:10.821 --> 03:13.464
which raises the
possibility of strangulation.

03:14.765 --> 03:16.326
1.5 million.

03:16.327 --> 03:17.327
What?

03:17.328 --> 03:19.529
That's the population
of our fair city.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.601
That's how many
suspects we've got.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.233
(People speaking indistinctly)

03:23.234 --> 03:26.336
(Sheila) We are now
standing outside the offices

03:26.337 --> 03:28.378
of the Philadelphia
medical examiner.

03:28.379 --> 03:30.340
And guess who's been
tasked to examine the body.

03:30.341 --> 03:32.612
Why, none other than
judge Joan hunt's daughter...

03:32.613 --> 03:34.784
Megan hunt.

03:34.785 --> 03:36.616
Conspiracy,
conflict of interest,

03:36.617 --> 03:38.217
maybe a little bit of both?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.919
Stay tuned.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.294
(Muttering indistinctly)

03:44.295 --> 03:46.296
Ugh! Are you crazy?

03:46.297 --> 03:47.597
You could've broken my nose.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.329
And if I was carrying
evidence or pushing a body,

03:49.330 --> 03:50.930
you coulda just broken a case.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.302
Actually, I just did.

03:52.303 --> 03:55.365
That old woman that
you posted... Doris roth.

03:55.366 --> 03:56.866
She died from
complications of crohn's.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.309
Great. Let me see it.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.910
Ethan, this ain't my report.

04:00.911 --> 04:03.242
This is the "temple
of justice" web site.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.344
Well, I like to stay informed.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.376
If following Sheila temple
means you informed,

04:06.377 --> 04:08.348
I don't want to know
nothin' about nothin'.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.519
You should bone up on this case,

04:09.520 --> 04:10.880
because it's about to
become our nightmare.

04:10.881 --> 04:12.382
(Elevator bell dings) Hmm.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.324
Oh, you see. I got this.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.356
Hey, boys, Dr. Ethan gross.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.627
How you doing? (Curtis) Hell no.

04:17.628 --> 04:19.389
Let's go... you
can back your ass

04:19.390 --> 04:21.391
right back in that elevator. Oh, come
on, guys. Just a couple of questions.

04:21.392 --> 04:22.732
Unh-unh. I got a couple of
answers. Just a couple of questions.

04:22.733 --> 04:23.993
I'd love to. I just...
Say it walking.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.295
Dr. Ethan gross. Move.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.396
Fine, fine. I'm sorry.

04:26.397 --> 04:27.497
Move. (Sighs)

04:27.498 --> 04:29.038
(Elevator bell dings)

04:29.039 --> 04:31.541
You know, you're a
real people person.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.343
It's your gift.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.405
You might want
to hold on to this.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.646
This case is gonna suck you in.

04:36.647 --> 04:38.348
Mm-hmm.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.580
Hillary stone.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.953
Chalk this up to a
problem that solved itself.

04:43.954 --> 04:47.286
What does that sign say?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.519
"This is where I get a lecture

04:49.520 --> 04:51.691
from Dr. Megan hunt."

04:51.692 --> 04:53.723
The... oh, I'm
sorry. That's... it's...

04:53.724 --> 04:56.396
"this is where death
rejoices to teach the living."

04:56.397 --> 04:57.867
It is never a place

04:57.868 --> 05:00.470
where the living
disparage the dead,

05:00.471 --> 05:02.432
so keep your
opinions to yourself

05:02.433 --> 05:03.733
and focus on the facts.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.635
Both translations seem to work.

05:05.636 --> 05:07.607
Don't encourage him.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.778
Now...

05:08.779 --> 05:09.939
Yeah.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.681
Dr. Gross. Mm-hmm.

05:11.682 --> 05:13.483
(Inhales deeply)

05:13.484 --> 05:14.884
Okay.

05:14.885 --> 05:17.387
Light, patterned abrasions
on the right side of her face,

05:17.388 --> 05:19.489
cheek, and orbit.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.451
Which means the killer
might have worn gloves

05:21.452 --> 05:22.922
when he hit her. (Sighs)

05:22.923 --> 05:24.394
A theory supported by

05:24.395 --> 05:26.456
the indistinct hand
impressions on her neck.

05:26.457 --> 05:27.428
Hmm.

05:27.429 --> 05:31.461
Contusions on the
posterior lower back,

05:31.462 --> 05:34.033
bilaterally, and...

05:34.034 --> 05:38.508
She has a 6-inch
laceration on her left calf.

05:38.509 --> 05:39.639
Looks like there's trace.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.340
Get a sample and
take it to the lab.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.443
And get them to process
a sexual assault kit.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.674
We have a tear.

05:44.675 --> 05:47.517
(Morris) Beaten down
and possibly raped.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.348
Somebody really
had their way with her.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.422
You don't know the half of it.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.485
(Pops)

05:59.490 --> 06:02.392
She had dirt underneath
her eyelids. So?

06:02.393 --> 06:04.934
So that means she was blinking.

06:04.935 --> 06:07.437
Hillary stone

06:07.438 --> 06:10.770
was buried alive.

06:10.771 --> 06:14.705
(Fabric snaps)

06:20.511 --> 06:22.552
The world's waiting
on your determination.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.754
Oh, great. You know
how much I love publicity.

06:24.755 --> 06:26.456
Want me to take it?

06:26.457 --> 06:29.789
(Chuckles) Additional
findings support the theory

06:29.790 --> 06:32.722
that Hillary was beaten
and then buried alive.

06:32.723 --> 06:34.664
(Ethan) The only
thing she doesn't have

06:34.665 --> 06:36.566
are defensive wounds.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.867
It just freaks me out

06:37.868 --> 06:41.000
that this hand ended
a 5 year old's life.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.632
All right, Dr. Gross, since
you are so fascinated

06:42.633 --> 06:44.003
by this case,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.835
I would like you to
section all of the organs

06:45.836 --> 06:47.637
and then write up
the autopsy report.

06:47.638 --> 06:49.008
Get to know Hillary better.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.680
Trust me. I know
her. No, you do not.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.011
You only know what's
been said about her.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.683
This is Hillary.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.845
All right. Can we
release cause of death?

06:55.846 --> 06:58.888
My preliminary
determination is asphyxiation

06:58.889 --> 07:03.092
contributed by agonal aspiration
of gastric contents and dirt.

07:03.093 --> 07:04.924
Isn't bud supposed
to be present for this?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.727
Yeah, he's heading downstairs.
Hillary's mother's here.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.559
(People shouting indistinctly)

07:09.560 --> 07:11.030
(Sheila) Ruth stone
has just arrived

07:11.031 --> 07:13.563
to identify the body
of her dead daughter.

07:13.564 --> 07:15.064
(Morris) Philly p.D.

07:15.065 --> 07:17.106
(Shouting continues)

07:17.107 --> 07:18.638
Make a path!

07:18.639 --> 07:21.571
I'm not gonna say it twice!

07:21.572 --> 07:24.544
(Shouting continues)

07:24.545 --> 07:25.745
You all right?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.446
They slashed my tires,
cracked my windshield,

07:27.447 --> 07:28.748
egged my house.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.720
Lord knows what
they're gonna do to me.

07:30.721 --> 07:31.751
Well, they'll have
to go through me.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.082
Mrs. Stone. Come on.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.925
Mrs. Stone, are you finally
ready to break your silence?

07:35.926 --> 07:37.086
(Shouting continues)

07:37.087 --> 07:38.628
Please don't.

07:38.629 --> 07:41.791
Well, what are you feeling
right now, Mrs. Stone,

07:41.792 --> 07:43.593
grief or relief?

07:43.594 --> 07:46.696
(Shouting continues)

07:46.697 --> 07:50.240
We are so sorry for
your loss, Mrs. Stone.

07:52.803 --> 07:54.744
May I see her?

07:54.745 --> 07:56.676
No. I'm... I'm afraid
that's not possible

07:56.677 --> 07:58.808
while the case is
ongoing, but soon.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.780
(Morris) Do you have any idea

08:00.781 --> 08:02.682
where your daughter
may have gone

08:02.683 --> 08:04.714
after her release
yesterday morning?

08:04.715 --> 08:06.716
We were supposed
to get together...

08:06.717 --> 08:07.688
(Inhales deeply)

08:07.689 --> 08:10.189
Uh, on the weekend.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.764
We hoped that the
hubbub would've died down.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.065
(Sighs)

08:16.066 --> 08:18.798
Hil had a hard life.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.870
She was always a little bit wild

08:20.871 --> 08:23.072
but sweet

08:23.073 --> 08:26.505
and joyous.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.238
Then she... Entered high school

08:29.239 --> 08:31.180
and she met Craig.

08:31.181 --> 08:32.682
He got her pregnant

08:32.683 --> 08:35.715
and led her down the wrong path.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.688
I'm sure that you did
the very best you could.

08:38.689 --> 08:40.850
But sometimes,
holding them close

08:40.851 --> 08:43.593
creates more of a distance.

08:43.594 --> 08:46.596
I thought when my beautiful
grandson Simon was born,

08:46.597 --> 08:48.928
maybe that would've
grounded her.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.302
Now they're both gone.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.012
(Sighs)

09:03.013 --> 09:06.617
What's she doing here?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.881
Uh, that is my mother.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.027
Your mother must be very proud

09:18.028 --> 09:20.290
to have such an
accomplished daughter.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.163
Please know that I care
about justice for Hillary

09:24.164 --> 09:26.836
just as much as she did.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.739
If you'll excuse me?

09:32.202 --> 09:34.874
Have you read the paper today?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.046
I've had enough of
the media, thank you.

09:37.047 --> 09:40.009
Well, they wrote
an op-ed about me,

09:40.010 --> 09:41.811
and it is not flattering.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.113
Mother, everybody knows you
handled that case impeccably.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.655
Well, as usual, you've
missed the point.

09:45.656 --> 09:47.657
I came here to forbid
you to talk to the press,

09:47.658 --> 09:49.819
either on your behalf
or to defend me.

09:49.820 --> 09:52.822
My election is tomorrow,
and this case is poison.

09:52.823 --> 09:54.764
(Laughs) Oh, my god.
Just write a rebuttal.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.025
Get ahead of it.

09:56.026 --> 09:57.196
That's exactly why I'm here,

09:57.197 --> 09:59.298
because you think
that's a good idea.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.130
No talking, no press.

10:01.131 --> 10:02.872
Okay?

10:02.873 --> 10:03.974
Got it.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.376
Always a pleasure, Joan.

10:07.377 --> 10:09.338
(Sheila) Judge Joan's

10:09.339 --> 10:11.040
bungling of the case

10:11.041 --> 10:13.783
left Hillary a free woman.

10:13.784 --> 10:16.315
Well, citizens of Philadelphia,

10:16.316 --> 10:18.818
let's give her a little
brotherly payback.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.090
Her reelection's up...
Your mom's taking a bath.

10:21.091 --> 10:22.621
I'm sure her
opponent's thrilled.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.193
She doesn't have one.

10:24.194 --> 10:25.925
Huh?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.727
It is a yea or nay vote

10:27.728 --> 10:30.259
whether to reconfirm
her for another ten years.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.032
So she could lose to nobody?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.705
Isn't there something
you should be doing?

10:35.706 --> 10:37.006
Oh, finished sectioning.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.008
Uh, the organs are bagged
and back in the body.

10:39.009 --> 10:40.910
I'm just waiting for
the lab to e-mail me

10:40.911 --> 10:42.872
the, uh, sexual assault results.

10:42.873 --> 10:44.073
In the break room?

10:44.074 --> 10:46.075
Welcome to generation "I."

10:46.076 --> 10:47.817
I mean, here I am,
out of the office,

10:47.818 --> 10:49.719
still connected.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.851
Why does everybody
keep doing that?

10:51.852 --> 10:54.083
(Sheila speaking indistinctly)

10:54.084 --> 10:56.425
Oh, look, you got
them five minutes ago.

10:56.426 --> 10:58.988
And they are positive.
What the hell, Ethan?

10:58.989 --> 11:01.330
I'm s-s... I'm sorry.

11:01.331 --> 11:02.692
No, you're not.

11:02.693 --> 11:03.833
Okay, well, maybe I'm not.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.095
Excuse me?

11:06.096 --> 11:07.867
(Sheila continues
speaking indistinctly)

11:07.868 --> 11:11.140
Hillary stone
killed her little boy.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.143
She then put him in a sack
and dumped him in the river.

11:14.144 --> 11:15.905
Now I know I'm
not supposed to let

11:15.906 --> 11:17.907
my personal feelings seep in,

11:17.908 --> 11:19.348
but... it took a year

11:19.349 --> 11:21.951
for them to try to
get justice for Simon,

11:21.952 --> 11:24.183
and then it didn't happen.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.716
So what's another five minutes?

11:26.717 --> 11:28.357
You may feel that way,

11:28.358 --> 11:31.060
but get over it. Why?

11:31.061 --> 11:33.162
Because we don't pay
you to waste my time.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.394
So I'll call bud.
No, you will not.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.926
I'll do it.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.397
(TV playing indistinctly)

11:38.398 --> 11:39.769
(People speaking indistinctly)

11:39.770 --> 11:41.170
(Sighs)

11:41.171 --> 11:44.003
I got Hillary's tox results.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.075
I dug around into
her personal history.

11:46.076 --> 11:48.077
Do you know, when she was 7,

11:48.078 --> 11:51.310
the police found her next to
her mother's unconscious body?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.012
Her father's fists
were so swollen,

11:53.013 --> 11:56.045
he couldn't turn the
knob to let the cops in.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.917
Abuse does terrible
things to people.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.090
Yeah, and 99% of them channel
their damage in other ways.

12:01.091 --> 12:03.893
But they're still damaged,
Kate, which is probably why

12:03.894 --> 12:06.956
we found booze and
Diazepam in her system.

12:06.957 --> 12:08.858
That explains why
she didn't fight back.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.901
This whole case
just breaks my heart.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.764
(Woman) Listen, Kojak.

12:14.765 --> 12:16.065
I done it to that wraith.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.767
First of all, my name
is detective Morris.

12:17.768 --> 12:19.238
And second of
all, no, you didn't.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.772
Thank you. Thank you very much.

12:22.773 --> 12:24.073
I took that bitch down.

12:24.074 --> 12:26.075
I don't know why you
ain't listening to me.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.747
Maybe because most killers
don't voluntarily confess,

12:28.748 --> 12:30.049
you know?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.350
Well, it's my
conscience. It's killing me.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.823
Detective Morris...

12:33.824 --> 12:36.025
Oh, no, no. You got this one.

12:36.026 --> 12:38.157
Every nut job in the city

12:38.158 --> 12:40.029
wants credit for offing Hillary.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.190
Yeah, except for
the actual killer.

12:41.191 --> 12:42.361
Yeah.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.063
Sexual assault results
came back positive

12:44.064 --> 12:45.895
on Craig bena.

12:45.896 --> 12:47.897
Ooh, the ex. Uh, I'll
rustle up an address.

12:47.898 --> 12:50.369
Sadly, I saw a minute of
"temple of justice" last night.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.843
He's on her show today.

12:53.844 --> 12:58.077
(Voice breaking) Please,
help me find the killer.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.009
They're my family.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.411
And they've been
taken away from me.

13:02.412 --> 13:05.384
And the killer
is still out there.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.888
What if the same
person got both of them?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.089
What if I'm next?

13:10.090 --> 13:12.091
(Woman) Just wait right there.
(Morris whispers) Thank you.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.092
Uh...

13:13.093 --> 13:15.364
Someone has to do something.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.126
So please...

13:17.127 --> 13:19.028
Please...

13:19.029 --> 13:22.401
If you know anything...

13:22.402 --> 13:26.435
Uh, Craig, here you go.

13:26.436 --> 13:29.338
You accused the media

13:29.339 --> 13:31.110
of vilifying you,

13:31.111 --> 13:33.112
yet, here you are on my show,

13:33.113 --> 13:38.047
begging for sympathy
over Hillary's death.

13:38.048 --> 13:39.548
You invited me.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.390
Oh, apples and oranges, Craig.

13:41.391 --> 13:43.893
Who accepted the offer, huh?

13:43.894 --> 13:45.824
Well, let's ask the pros.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.827
Randy, can I have the mic?

13:49.099 --> 13:50.229
Thank you.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.101
Here is a man some
of you may remember

13:52.102 --> 13:55.104
as gallantly protecting
Hillary's mother this morning,

13:55.105 --> 13:57.336
one of Philadelphia's finest.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.440
And then when we
have Dr. Megan hunt,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.172
daughter of the judge

14:03.173 --> 14:06.345
who helped create this
mess in the first place.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.078
What have you
to say for yourself?

14:09.079 --> 14:11.220
You missed a spot.

14:11.221 --> 14:12.581
(Chuckles)

14:12.582 --> 14:15.554
Every bit as charming
as her mother.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.086
We'll be right back.

14:17.087 --> 14:19.058
Ronnie, thank you.
(Man) And we're clear.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.030
(Woman) All right.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.530
So...

14:21.531 --> 14:23.893
Are you here to finally
give me the interview

14:23.894 --> 14:25.194
your mother wouldn't?

14:25.195 --> 14:27.036
(Laughs) Right.

14:27.037 --> 14:31.070
Well, whenever you're ready,
you know where to find me.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.102
Mm. Under a rock.

14:33.103 --> 14:35.975
And until then, I think I'll
just get back to my guest.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.547
Actually, uh, this
interview is over.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.409
What? Why?

14:40.410 --> 14:43.183
Because it's our turn
to talk to the killer.

14:52.963 --> 14:54.223
I am impressed.

14:54.224 --> 14:57.066
Take to the airwaves,
profess your innocence,

14:57.067 --> 14:59.098
throw the guilt out
there somewhere,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.200
except everybody knows that...

15:01.201 --> 15:04.033
You know that
Hillary killed your son.

15:04.034 --> 15:07.136
That is not true.

15:07.137 --> 15:08.637
Hillary's mom
certainly thinks so,

15:08.638 --> 15:11.110
says you're the reason she
went down the wrong path.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.911
Yeah, and she always
had it out for me,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.384
hated that I actually
made her daughter happy.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.086
Do you think that, uh,

15:17.087 --> 15:18.917
Mrs. Stone knows
about yesterday?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.190
Because we certainly know
you had sex with Hillary.

15:21.191 --> 15:23.222
Care to tell us how that...

15:23.223 --> 15:24.995
Came to pass, Craig?

15:27.157 --> 15:28.457
The day she got released,

15:28.458 --> 15:31.200
she showed up at my place,

15:31.201 --> 15:33.062
had a few drinks,

15:33.063 --> 15:34.403
and then we made love.

15:34.404 --> 15:36.305
Love?

15:36.306 --> 15:38.507
Well, this...

15:38.508 --> 15:40.209
Doesn't look...

15:40.210 --> 15:42.671
Like love to me.

15:42.672 --> 15:45.174
Those marks look like
your hands around her neck.

15:45.175 --> 15:47.076
Hil liked it a little rough.

15:47.077 --> 15:48.247
Buried alive kind of rough?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.119
I didn't kill her.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.121
Afterwards, we both fell asleep.

15:52.122 --> 15:54.053
When I woke up, she was gone.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.125
Y-You want me to believe

15:56.126 --> 15:58.587
that she just showed up,

15:58.588 --> 16:01.260
had her way with you,
and then just disappeared?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.962
Yes. That was life with hil.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.536
I know it sounds crazy.

16:07.998 --> 16:09.598
It does.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.340
(Peter) What little I've gleaned

16:11.341 --> 16:13.042
from your legendary
teaching methods,

16:13.043 --> 16:15.174
I know that only
oxygen deprivation

16:15.175 --> 16:17.976
can cause darkened
cells like that.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.278
Did I teach you that?

16:19.279 --> 16:20.449
Mm.

16:20.450 --> 16:21.610
Hmm.

16:21.611 --> 16:23.312
And, yes, the
anoxic brain damage

16:23.313 --> 16:25.254
certainly supports asphyxiation.

16:25.255 --> 16:28.357
But you're looking for
bigger answers, aren't you?

16:28.358 --> 16:30.559
Not the cause of death,
but the cause of life.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.221
Well, everyone says
Hillary was such a monster,

16:32.222 --> 16:34.093
that she did all
these horrible things

16:34.094 --> 16:36.095
without any bit of remorse.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.226
Even if that is true,

16:37.227 --> 16:39.298
maybe there's something
identifiable in the brain.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.300
Sometimes crazy is just crazy.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.672
It's just in the genes.
I cannot accept that.

16:43.673 --> 16:46.205
I have the result from
the trace on Hillary's leg.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.137
It's a polyepoxide copolymer

16:48.138 --> 16:50.008
with a hint of...

16:50.009 --> 16:51.180
Wait for it...

16:51.181 --> 16:52.311
Triethylenetetramine.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.183
That's a resin that's
used as a sealant

16:54.184 --> 16:55.744
around the windows on boats.

16:55.745 --> 16:58.217
Did I teach you that, too? No,
believe it or not, my dad did.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.249
Well, get yourself to
the Marina, skipper,

17:00.250 --> 17:02.492
because there's one about
a mile from the crime scene.

17:04.654 --> 17:06.095
(Chuckles) S-skipper.

17:06.096 --> 17:08.026
Go to work.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.229
Yes.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.602
(Sighs)

17:14.604 --> 17:17.206
And why exactly
have I met you here?

17:17.207 --> 17:19.368
The cut on Hillary's
leg is probably from

17:19.369 --> 17:21.340
her being put through
a boat window,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.442
so if we find a broken one,
we could possibly find the killer.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.813
Okay. Are you the cop from TV?

17:24.814 --> 17:26.815
Oh, yes, ladies, this
is him, in the flesh.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.348
I told you it was him.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.420
You totally protected
that old lady in her car,

17:31.421 --> 17:33.422
even though she
raised that psycho.

17:33.423 --> 17:35.284
Are you looking for the killer?

17:35.285 --> 17:36.825
Girls, best just
let us do our jobs.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.487
Okay? Okay.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.189
(Camera phone shutter
clicks) Tweet you later.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.260
(Giggles)

17:41.261 --> 17:42.591
(Laughs)

17:42.592 --> 17:44.293
Bud Morris, you're a superhero.

17:44.294 --> 17:47.436
Notoriety's a double-edged
sword, my friend.

17:47.437 --> 17:50.739
Take that old lady who
raised her psycho daughter

17:50.740 --> 17:52.441
and grandson

17:52.442 --> 17:54.243
and had both of them taken away.

17:54.244 --> 17:55.604
What's she left with...

17:55.605 --> 17:57.706
Slashed tires, egg on her house?

17:57.707 --> 18:00.379
A mother's love turns
into a public's hate.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.581
Hey.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.313
(Clatters)

18:04.314 --> 18:08.257
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:08.258 --> 18:10.219
You think I killed Hillary?

18:10.220 --> 18:11.360
You're a prison guard.

18:11.361 --> 18:12.691
I'd like to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

18:12.692 --> 18:16.425
but from where I sit, it looks
pretty bad, Ms. Raymond.

18:16.426 --> 18:19.168
Look, we bonded
during her trial.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.630
That girl... She was innocent.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.732
So I told her, if she
needed a safe haven,

18:23.733 --> 18:25.634
she could find it on my boat.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.576
Well, it worked
like gangbusters.

18:27.577 --> 18:29.438
And then what happened?

18:29.439 --> 18:31.780
Two days ago, Hillary shows up.

18:31.781 --> 18:33.782
I'm headed off to work.

18:33.783 --> 18:35.814
She's messed up,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.646
definitely drunk.

18:37.647 --> 18:39.648
Mm-hmm. So I gave
her a couple of sedatives.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.350
I locked her in.

18:41.351 --> 18:42.821
(Laughs)

18:42.822 --> 18:45.324
I-I love your concept
of safe haven.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.456
It sounds exactly like jail.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.258
It was for her own good.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.659
I didn't want her wandering off,

18:50.660 --> 18:52.461
finding herself in harm's way.

18:52.462 --> 18:54.433
She must have woke
up and freaked out.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.266
You drugged her
and you locked her in.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.439
What did you think
was gonna happen?

19:01.471 --> 19:03.242
Come on.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.375
Me and you, we...
We're on the same team.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.717
Can't we just see eye to eye?

19:08.718 --> 19:09.849
Are you kidding?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.923
We're processing
your boat as we speak.

19:16.526 --> 19:18.257
I'm still trying to figure
out Hillary's actions

19:18.258 --> 19:19.528
on the day of her release.

19:19.529 --> 19:20.759
(Camera shutter clicks)

19:20.760 --> 19:22.561
She gets out, goes to
see her ex-boyfriend,

19:22.562 --> 19:23.892
has sex with him,

19:23.893 --> 19:25.864
and then comes here.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.367
Why?

19:30.940 --> 19:32.401
Combo lock.

19:32.402 --> 19:34.303
It means that Hillary
couldn't get out,

19:34.304 --> 19:36.405
but anyone who had
the number could enter.

19:36.406 --> 19:38.407
Well, I bet somebody did,
otherwise, why would you

19:38.408 --> 19:41.251
kick out a window
with your bare feet?

19:43.953 --> 19:46.755
Okay, I've got what
looks like epithelials.

19:46.756 --> 19:50.559
Collect, label, and let's
get out of this dump.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.860
You know what?

19:51.861 --> 19:53.762
My dad would've loved
to own a boat like this.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.764
Really? Yeah.

19:55.765 --> 19:58.527
He really couldn't afford
to have another kid.

19:58.528 --> 20:00.229
(People speaking indistinctly)

20:00.230 --> 20:02.672
I was adopted because
he really wanted a boy.

20:03.903 --> 20:07.876
Some people are
meant to be parents.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.439
This case is really
bothering you, huh?

20:10.440 --> 20:11.740
The one that bothers me

20:11.741 --> 20:14.484
is the one we didn't
get to investigate.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.886
(Kate) So the info about
the boat is out there,

20:17.887 --> 20:19.618
on Twitter, as a matter of fact,

20:19.619 --> 20:21.590
with a hunky picture
of bud attached.

20:21.591 --> 20:22.991
(Chuckles)

20:22.992 --> 20:25.454
And the media is now trying
to align you with your mother,

20:25.455 --> 20:26.755
which is doing
this office no favors.

20:26.756 --> 20:28.427
Sheila temple's right outside,
waiting for us to trip up.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.459
Uh, I may have something.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.562
Uh, the flakes on the pillowcase
contain sebaceous secretions

20:33.563 --> 20:35.264
of malassezia furfur

20:35.265 --> 20:36.565
and tragacanth.

20:36.566 --> 20:37.666
Dandruff.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.268
Something that
Hillary did not have.

20:39.269 --> 20:40.439
Maybe Tanya does.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.540
No, she doesn't.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.011
Just came from holding

20:43.012 --> 20:44.543
where I personally
checked myself.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.545
We may have her on
unlawfully restraining Hillary,

20:46.546 --> 20:47.846
but we don't have
her on flaky scalp.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.281
So who else was on that boat?

20:52.622 --> 20:53.622
I'll be right back.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.356
Bless you, Amanda,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.757
and thank you for
watching. Thank you.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.928
All right? And good luck.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.460
Mm-hmm, and thank
you for coming by.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.661
We'll be here all day.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.363
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:04.364 --> 21:06.635
Ms. Temple.

21:06.636 --> 21:08.837
Oh, are you finally
ready for your interview?

21:08.838 --> 21:10.499
Uh, no, no, I would just like
a moment in private, please.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.371
Well, whatever you say to
me, you can say to my public.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.572
Are you rolling? (Sighs)

21:13.573 --> 21:14.743
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:14.744 --> 21:17.005
the interview that
only I could score.

21:17.006 --> 21:20.309
Dr. Megan hunt... A name
which may ring a bell...

21:20.310 --> 21:22.511
Because she shares
it with the woman

21:22.512 --> 21:24.553
who let Hillary go free.

21:24.554 --> 21:27.556
My mother adjudicated
without bias or error.

21:27.557 --> 21:28.687
Oh, come on.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.859
Including suppressing the bag

21:30.860 --> 21:33.362
that was found near
poor little Simon's body,

21:33.363 --> 21:35.624
which had Hillary's
d.N.A. On it?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.295
Wait. You mean the
bag that the prosecution

21:37.296 --> 21:39.768
failed to disclose, then
lost, then found again?

21:39.769 --> 21:41.600
Judge hunt did her job,

21:41.601 --> 21:43.402
just as I am doing mine.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.535
Well, I'm sure that brings us
all a great degree of comfort.

21:46.536 --> 21:49.539
(Crowd laughing)

21:50.710 --> 21:53.682
There has been a
major break in the case.

21:53.683 --> 21:55.744
Evidence has been
found linking someone

21:55.745 --> 21:58.447
to the disappearance
of Hillary stone

21:58.448 --> 22:00.619
and possibly her murder.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.352
You heard it here
first. Who is it?

22:03.353 --> 22:05.355
You.

22:06.596 --> 22:08.528
Cut.

22:13.603 --> 22:15.333
What is this, some
kind of publicity stunt?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.366
Oh, we don't need
theatrics, Ms. Temple,

22:17.367 --> 22:20.338
because we actually have
evidence to back up our claims.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.770
Like what?

22:21.771 --> 22:22.941
You have eczema,

22:22.942 --> 22:25.073
which your makeup
guy tried to cover,

22:25.074 --> 22:27.345
but, mm, really didn't
do a very good job.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.778
And because of that, you
have to use natural hair spray

22:29.779 --> 22:31.880
like naturecoat,

22:31.881 --> 22:33.382
which contains tragacanth,

22:33.383 --> 22:36.455
flakes of which we found
on Tanya Raymond's boat.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.727
A lot of people use
natural hairspray, Sherlock.

22:38.728 --> 22:39.858
(Chuckles)

22:39.859 --> 22:42.030
I would be very happy

22:42.031 --> 22:44.132
to scrape your scalp to confirm.

22:44.133 --> 22:46.535
You see, Ms. Temple,

22:46.536 --> 22:49.367
we don't take callers
or commercial breaks...

22:49.368 --> 22:50.639
Just confessions.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.842
I had seen the shaky
evidence against Hillary.

22:53.843 --> 22:56.605
I knew the case
would never make,

22:56.606 --> 22:59.007
but I also knew that Hillary

22:59.008 --> 23:01.410
would never Grant me an
interview when she got out.

23:01.411 --> 23:05.484
So you paid her prison
guard to get close to her,

23:05.485 --> 23:06.855
gain her trust.

23:06.856 --> 23:09.458
That's really classy.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.560
I offered incentives in exchange

23:11.561 --> 23:13.892
for drawing Hillary in.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.525
Imagine my delight
when Tanya called me

23:16.526 --> 23:19.167
on the very day
of Hillary's release.

23:19.168 --> 23:23.472
We showed up at the boat
with the cameras rolling,

23:23.473 --> 23:25.774
burst in.

23:25.775 --> 23:27.736
Al Capone's vault.

23:27.737 --> 23:30.579
I'm gonna need to see
that footage, Ms. Temple.

23:30.580 --> 23:33.081
It is your alibi.

23:33.082 --> 23:34.484
Fine.

23:36.085 --> 23:38.547
Oh, my goodness.

23:38.548 --> 23:40.649
The polls are open.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.792
My condolences to
your mother's career.

23:51.200 --> 23:55.133
(Indistinct conversations)

23:55.134 --> 23:57.435
Wow. Big turnout.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.438
I see you didn't take my advice.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.511
You appeared on
that show yesterday

24:02.512 --> 24:04.513
and again this morning,
stumping for me.

24:04.514 --> 24:06.144
(Sighs) Both
times, case related.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.016
That's always your
excuse, isn't it?

24:08.017 --> 24:09.918
Well, you just
added fuel to the fire.

24:09.919 --> 24:12.450
Mother, you of all
people should understand

24:12.451 --> 24:14.152
that I want justice for Hillary.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.685
Well, welcome to
my world, darling.

24:16.686 --> 24:19.227
The court of public opinion
convenes and convicts

24:19.228 --> 24:21.790
before charges are brought.

24:21.791 --> 24:23.091
You gotta be kidding me.

24:23.092 --> 24:25.534
You really working
that "woe is me" angle?

24:25.535 --> 24:26.496
Do I know you?

24:26.497 --> 24:27.636
No, but I know you.

24:27.637 --> 24:29.698
You put killers
back on the street.

24:29.699 --> 24:32.470
I got kids. I'd like them
to be able to walk around

24:32.471 --> 24:33.542
without fearing for their lives.

24:33.543 --> 24:35.203
Okay, come on, mom.

24:35.204 --> 24:36.545
No. No, Megan.

24:36.546 --> 24:38.707
No hooligan is
gonna scare me off.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.048
You're going down,

24:40.049 --> 24:42.050
just like that
bitch you set free.

24:42.051 --> 24:45.054
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

24:46.556 --> 24:48.116
(Sheila) Behind this door

24:48.117 --> 24:50.889
lies an unsuspecting
Hillary stone.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.922
Well, Hillary, get ready...

24:53.923 --> 24:56.625
For last call.

24:56.626 --> 24:59.268
It is time to face the...

25:00.600 --> 25:02.571
Oh, for the love of Pete.

25:02.572 --> 25:05.273
She must have
gone out the window.

25:05.274 --> 25:06.775
Well, cut, cut, cut.

25:06.776 --> 25:10.739
I am so tired of this sugar!

25:10.740 --> 25:12.811
You happy? No.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.583
I'd like to see everything
you shot, please.

25:14.584 --> 25:16.514
My first amendment rights...

25:16.515 --> 25:18.547
Okay, you say first amendment.
I say obstruction of justice.

25:18.548 --> 25:20.248
The judge will say
contempt of court.

25:20.249 --> 25:22.290
How long you
gonna spend in jail?

25:22.291 --> 25:24.252
Well, you heard
him, Mr. Man. Scoot.

25:24.253 --> 25:26.595
Yes, ma'am.

25:26.596 --> 25:29.057
(Footsteps retreating)

25:29.058 --> 25:30.729
I used to watch you, you know,

25:30.730 --> 25:32.601
back when you
were a real journalist.

25:32.602 --> 25:35.664
Oh, past tense? Ouch.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.305
What happened?

25:37.306 --> 25:38.267
(Chuckles)

25:38.268 --> 25:40.138
Success.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.269
Bigger cases.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.011
You see it, too, detective.

25:43.012 --> 25:45.073
What we do isn't
all that different.

25:45.074 --> 25:46.615
(Laughs)

25:46.616 --> 25:47.876
Mm.

25:47.877 --> 25:50.148
You're really gonna
try that line on me?

25:50.149 --> 25:53.151
You hate me, don't you?

25:53.152 --> 25:54.322
(Exhales)

25:54.323 --> 25:55.584
No comment.

25:55.585 --> 25:58.687
Well, off the record...

25:58.688 --> 26:00.188
(Lowered voice)
I don't totally love

26:00.189 --> 26:01.690
who I've become either.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.231
Go back to journalism.

26:03.232 --> 26:06.294
We could use you.

26:06.295 --> 26:07.636
What's stopping you?

26:07.637 --> 26:09.097
All cued up to the crime
scene, Ms. Temple.

26:09.098 --> 26:10.268
And here are your glasses.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.670
Thank you, Ronnie.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.603
Uh, actually, it's... it's Dan.

26:14.604 --> 26:16.675
But you're welcome, Ms. Temple.

26:16.676 --> 26:20.349
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:22.612 --> 26:24.112
Darren, what are you doing?

26:24.113 --> 26:26.354
I swear to god, the
body's over there.

26:26.355 --> 26:28.016
If you do not get me
a shot of that body,

26:28.017 --> 26:29.858
you're gonna be back
shooting bar mitzvahs next week.

26:29.859 --> 26:31.359
(Sheila speaks indistinctly) Could
you stop it right there, please?

26:31.360 --> 26:34.693
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

26:34.694 --> 26:36.725
Well, I'll be damned.

26:36.726 --> 26:40.329
He was there before
the story broke.

26:42.632 --> 26:45.373
I told you, I did her.
I want credit for it.

26:45.374 --> 26:48.837
Walk me through what happened.

26:48.838 --> 26:51.609
Uh, it's... it's, like, dusk.

26:51.610 --> 26:55.213
I'm cutting through the
site on my way over to...

26:55.214 --> 26:56.785
It don't matter where.

26:56.786 --> 26:59.617
I see this chick.
She's kinda hot.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.690
Looks lost.

27:01.691 --> 27:04.322
Holy crap, it's that
baby-killing skank.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.954
So I took her down.

27:05.955 --> 27:08.326
How? You hit
her, kick her, what?

27:08.327 --> 27:09.828
Kicked her first.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.329
Where?

27:11.330 --> 27:12.901
(Inhales deeply)

27:12.902 --> 27:15.664
(Exhales) The
left, on her left side.

27:15.665 --> 27:17.335
And she bounced
off that backhoe.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.067
And then?

27:19.068 --> 27:20.408
And then what?

27:20.409 --> 27:21.740
She lay in the hole

27:21.741 --> 27:23.812
and dies like the
dog that she was.

27:23.813 --> 27:26.816
That's all I'm saying.

27:28.778 --> 27:30.720
Let's go.

27:36.986 --> 27:38.687
(Sighs)

27:38.688 --> 27:41.359
Gotta say, his story holds up.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.834
(Scoffs) His story is just what
the media's been reporting.

27:45.835 --> 27:47.836
Ah, but that's why I
asked about the kick.

27:47.837 --> 27:50.398
Your preliminary autopsy
report said that there was

27:50.399 --> 27:52.841
a kidney puncture
and bruising on the left.

27:52.842 --> 27:54.843
The media doesn't
have that detail.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.705
Since when do you
read the prelims?

27:56.706 --> 27:59.708
It may surprise you
to know, but always.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.279
Are you sure it
was the left side?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.451
I know your reports
better than you do?

28:03.452 --> 28:04.913
I didn't write it.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.385
That doesn't sound like you.

28:08.057 --> 28:10.919
You're right. It doesn't.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.722
Contusions and
lacerations on the left kidney,

28:13.723 --> 28:15.463
just like Victor said.

28:15.464 --> 28:16.965
Something's not right.

28:16.966 --> 28:18.967
(Chuckles) What, like
you being wrong for once?

28:18.968 --> 28:20.829
I am never wrong.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.001
The body is always right.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.434
And I just don't know
Hillary as well as I should.

28:26.876 --> 28:28.737
Left kidney,

28:28.738 --> 28:30.839
right kidney.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.180
Left's got the puncture.

28:32.181 --> 28:34.813
Yes, but the rib is
fractured on the right.

28:34.814 --> 28:35.985
(Sighs)

28:39.488 --> 28:40.949
Call Ethan.

28:40.950 --> 28:41.950
Why?

28:41.951 --> 28:44.253
Because I'm gonna kill him.

28:48.898 --> 28:50.398
What's up, guys?

28:50.399 --> 28:53.101
I'm missing the last
frame of league night.

28:53.102 --> 28:54.232
(Scoffs)

28:54.233 --> 28:58.306
Tell me, Dr. Gross...

28:58.307 --> 29:00.338
Is it possible for a rib

29:00.339 --> 29:02.510
to jump across the body

29:02.511 --> 29:05.473
and lacerate the
opposite kidney?

29:05.474 --> 29:07.415
(Chuckles) What? No.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.077
Then please explain

29:09.078 --> 29:10.919
your findings in
the autopsy report...

29:10.920 --> 29:14.282
Mislabeled organs,
misattributed injuries,

29:14.283 --> 29:18.187
and possibly, the entire
case compromised.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.530
Uh...

29:22.531 --> 29:24.863
(Pants)

29:24.864 --> 29:26.134
Uh-oh.

29:26.135 --> 29:28.266
Left side triangles,

29:28.267 --> 29:30.168
right side squares...

29:30.169 --> 29:31.970
You cut them into
different shapes

29:31.971 --> 29:34.142
so you do not make
rookie mistakes,

29:34.143 --> 29:35.844
which you did!

29:35.845 --> 29:38.306
I'm... i'm... I'm really
sorry. I'm gonna fix this...

29:38.307 --> 29:40.008
No, you will not touch a thing!

29:40.009 --> 29:41.509
I am sick of your damn attitude,
your disrespect towards me,

29:41.510 --> 29:44.883
and especially, your
disrespect towards Hillary.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.985
Dr. Gross...

29:46.986 --> 29:48.888
Come with me.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.992
(Exhales)

29:54.363 --> 29:56.364
Please find a tech

29:56.365 --> 29:58.997
and pull Hillary's
body out of the drawer.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.199
(Snaps glove)

30:05.034 --> 30:07.805
Thanks. I thought I was
about to end up on a table.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.207
Still with the jokes, really?

30:09.208 --> 30:13.141
You know, Megan had
every right to rip your head off.

30:13.142 --> 30:15.313
What you did is either
sabotage, incompetence,

30:15.314 --> 30:16.444
or at the very
least, negligence.

30:16.445 --> 30:17.846
D... it was one mistake.

30:17.847 --> 30:19.187
On a case

30:19.188 --> 30:21.449
where you have made your
opinion abundantly known.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.820
Dr. Murphy, I'm so...

30:22.821 --> 30:24.392
You know what, Ethan?

30:24.393 --> 30:26.524
This is a big city. We're
gonna catch big cases.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.396
If you can't handle
this kind of thing,

30:28.397 --> 30:31.099
I can recommend a few fellowship
programs in allegheny county.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.230
No, no, no. I
love it here. It... i...

30:32.231 --> 30:33.561
Look, I don't
know what it was...

30:33.562 --> 30:35.133
The... the media,
the pressure, I just...

30:35.134 --> 30:36.404
I took my eye off the ball.

30:36.405 --> 30:39.508
Lame excuses
aren't really helping.

30:42.611 --> 30:44.342
Okay. You're right. I...

30:44.343 --> 30:46.044
(Inhales deeply)

30:46.045 --> 30:48.316
(Exhales) I hate this woman.

30:48.317 --> 30:51.349
I hate that we have to put
somebody in jail for this.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.121
So you think, sometimes,
it's okay to kill?

30:53.122 --> 30:54.622
Well, no, but she...

30:54.623 --> 30:56.355
She...

30:58.427 --> 31:00.188
No, I don't.

31:00.189 --> 31:01.429
I don't.

31:01.430 --> 31:03.431
I'm gonna go
apologize to Dr. Hunt.

31:03.432 --> 31:05.433
No, Ethan, you're
gonna take the night,

31:05.434 --> 31:08.237
clear your head, and we
will see you in the morning.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.002
What about you?

31:14.003 --> 31:17.305
You think Hillary
stone killed her son?

31:17.306 --> 31:19.307
Yeah, I do.

31:19.308 --> 31:22.010
And it doesn't matter.

31:22.011 --> 31:24.914
We'll see you in the morning.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.390
(Clicks)

31:32.391 --> 31:34.363
(Click)

31:37.296 --> 31:40.468
Oh, damn it.

31:40.469 --> 31:42.371
(Joan) So you've heard?

31:44.303 --> 31:46.404
(Sighs)

31:46.405 --> 31:50.009
I am so sorry.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.540
I came to tell you myself,

31:52.541 --> 31:55.083
but I-I guess I'm
going to have to learn

31:55.084 --> 31:57.085
that the media
beats you every time.

31:57.086 --> 31:58.416
(People speaking indistinctly)

31:58.417 --> 32:00.448
You okay?

32:00.449 --> 32:02.220
How does the Internet
say I'm dealing with it?

32:02.221 --> 32:04.422
Mother, come on.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.593
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

32:05.594 --> 32:07.295
(Huffs)

32:07.296 --> 32:09.357
I never imagined
that an entire career

32:09.358 --> 32:11.559
could be... undone

32:11.560 --> 32:14.502
by two days of bad press.

32:14.503 --> 32:16.164
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

32:16.165 --> 32:19.007
Frankly, i'm...

32:19.008 --> 32:22.470
I'm shell-shocked.

32:22.471 --> 32:24.443
Mom...

32:26.475 --> 32:30.479
Uh, Hillary's ready for you.

32:39.588 --> 32:44.292
You said it
yourself... I did my job.

32:44.293 --> 32:46.695
Now you go do yours.

32:53.642 --> 32:56.374
(Peter) I'm really
sorry about your mom.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.446
Are you okay?

32:58.447 --> 33:00.478
Yeah. I'm fine.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.411
My mother's tough, so I'm tough.

33:03.412 --> 33:05.713
It's all in the genes, remember?

33:05.714 --> 33:07.085
(Chuckles)

33:07.086 --> 33:08.386
(Plastic bag rustles)

33:08.387 --> 33:10.289
Ah, there's one.

33:13.522 --> 33:14.762
Two.

33:14.763 --> 33:17.565
Left kidney,

33:17.566 --> 33:19.267
no presenting damage,

33:19.268 --> 33:21.399
consistent with
my original findings.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.431
Right...

33:23.432 --> 33:25.703
Lacerated and contused.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.305
So Victor didn't do it.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.506
He was just looking
for a little fame.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.679
And you were right, as usual.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.212
No, I wasn't.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.544
There is a perinephric hematoma

33:36.545 --> 33:39.217
around the vasculature
that I missed before.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.518
But a rib can't do that, can it?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.050
No, it can't.

33:42.051 --> 33:45.693
This is usually caused by a
dramatic change in momentum.

33:45.694 --> 33:47.495
Like her fall out
the boat window.

33:47.496 --> 33:49.157
No, it would take
more force than that.

33:49.158 --> 33:51.559
Probably all of the
injuries on her left side

33:51.560 --> 33:53.061
are from the fall

33:53.062 --> 33:54.232
and on the right...

33:54.233 --> 33:55.503
The broken jaw, the rib,

33:55.504 --> 33:58.035
the lacerated kidney...

33:58.036 --> 34:01.038
That comes from some
kind of rapid deceleration.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.410
Okay, so?

34:02.411 --> 34:04.412
So this is the missing
piece of the puzzle.

34:04.413 --> 34:09.517
Hillary didn't walk to
the construction site.

34:09.518 --> 34:12.251
She caught a
ride with her killer.

34:17.786 --> 34:19.427
We finally know the
timeline of Hillary's last day.

34:19.428 --> 34:21.489
After she was released, she
went to see her ex-boyfriend Craig.

34:21.490 --> 34:22.760
(Morris) Who she slept with,

34:22.761 --> 34:25.263
and then for reasons
unknown, left to go to Tanya's,

34:25.264 --> 34:27.465
where she was taken
prisoner, drugged, escaped,

34:27.466 --> 34:29.497
and then someone,
possibly a stranger...

34:29.498 --> 34:30.498
Or Craig...

34:30.499 --> 34:32.540
Or Craig drove her
to the construction site,

34:32.541 --> 34:34.642
stopping suddenly enough
to send her into the dash.

34:34.643 --> 34:36.774
Which is most likely
the patterned impression

34:36.775 --> 34:38.406
we found on her jaw.

34:38.407 --> 34:40.548
She was then dragged
into a predug hole,

34:40.549 --> 34:43.381
which became her grave.

34:43.382 --> 34:47.085
Then we need
to find that driver.

34:48.457 --> 34:50.388
Ethan.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.821
Dr. Gross, back in the house.

34:53.822 --> 34:56.324
Dr. Hunt, I...

34:56.325 --> 34:57.825
(Exhales) I apologize

34:57.826 --> 35:00.368
for my earlier transgressions.

35:00.369 --> 35:02.171
Let's find this tool.

35:03.372 --> 35:04.832
Knowing we're
looking for a vehicle,

35:04.833 --> 35:06.774
I focused on the tread marks

35:06.775 --> 35:09.337
from Peter's photos
of the crime scene.

35:09.338 --> 35:12.710
Now after, uh, examining
Hillary's momentum injuries,

35:12.711 --> 35:14.682
I discovered that she
had been traveling

35:14.683 --> 35:16.544
at about 35 miles per hour.

35:16.545 --> 35:18.486
So you're looking
for a short skid.

35:18.487 --> 35:20.218
I found one.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.789
(Clicks keyboard keys)

35:21.790 --> 35:25.193
Two sets of tires, short skid.

35:25.194 --> 35:26.424
Could be the killer's car.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.555
(Kate) They're clean, unbroken.

35:27.556 --> 35:29.397
It means the car didn't
have antilock brakes.

35:29.398 --> 35:31.529
One problem... skid
marks don't give tire tread.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.402
You have a shot
just past the marks?

35:35.464 --> 35:37.435
(Clicks keyboard keys)

35:37.436 --> 35:38.736
Right there. That's
the car driving away,

35:38.737 --> 35:40.468
and those are the treads.

35:40.469 --> 35:41.539
(Click)

35:41.540 --> 35:43.711
Hey, Ethan. Zoom in.

35:43.712 --> 35:45.273
(Click) (Ethan) Enhance.

35:45.274 --> 35:46.544
No, something's wrong.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.716
One is very different
from the other three.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.649
Now why would that be?

35:52.281 --> 35:55.424
I might know.

35:59.228 --> 36:01.389
(Sighs)

36:01.390 --> 36:05.494
This model doesn't
have antilock brakes.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.669
This tire's different.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.201
After it got slashed,

36:13.202 --> 36:15.273
she probably got the
cheapest replacement.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.444
(Hinge creaks)

36:16.445 --> 36:18.746
Detective Morris, Dr. Hunt?

36:18.747 --> 36:20.808
I-I wasn't expecting you, was I?

36:20.809 --> 36:23.581
I think maybe you
were, Mrs. Stone.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.914
You drove Hillary to
the construction site.

36:26.915 --> 36:29.517
Your tire treads
will place you there.

36:29.518 --> 36:31.589
(Megan) You didn't
come by the morgue

36:31.590 --> 36:34.792
to I.D. Your daughter, did you?

36:34.793 --> 36:37.295
You came to see her body

36:37.296 --> 36:39.527
after what you'd done.

36:39.528 --> 36:41.769
May I see her now?

36:41.770 --> 36:43.571
No.

36:43.572 --> 36:46.435
I'm sorry. Not under
these circumstances.

36:50.639 --> 36:52.640
I'm gonna need to place
you under arrest, Mrs. Stone.

36:52.641 --> 36:53.741
Please let me see her.

36:53.742 --> 36:57.486
If you do, I'll tell
you everything.

37:07.696 --> 37:10.599
(Ruth exhales)

37:22.641 --> 37:26.915
The day she was released,
she called me in a panic.

37:28.677 --> 37:30.678
I picked her up at the Marina,

37:30.679 --> 37:33.651
and I was driving her home.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.525
She told me about her day.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.689
I couldn't...
couldn't understand

37:41.690 --> 37:43.931
why... why she
didn't stay with Craig.

37:43.932 --> 37:45.664
Why?

37:48.567 --> 37:51.599
Then she said...

37:51.600 --> 37:54.643
She didn't want
to be with Craig.

37:55.944 --> 37:57.645
She just wanted
to sleep with him

37:57.646 --> 37:59.648
to have another baby.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.584
That's what you
said, isn't it, honey?

38:07.686 --> 38:11.459
That you wanted to
get it right next time?

38:11.460 --> 38:14.492
And at that moment,

38:14.493 --> 38:16.564
I knew...

38:16.565 --> 38:18.727
(Cries)

38:20.068 --> 38:22.570
She'd killed Simon.

38:22.571 --> 38:25.603
I must have...

38:25.604 --> 38:28.306
Slammed on the brakes.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.640
Hillary... (Sniffles)
Flew into the dashboard,

38:32.641 --> 38:34.982
and...

38:34.983 --> 38:37.645
And I reached out to...

38:37.646 --> 38:39.787
To see if she was okay.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.721
She looked at me.

38:44.423 --> 38:47.855
She jumped out of the car and...

38:47.856 --> 38:50.929
She was running away, and...

38:52.401 --> 38:55.703
I tried to stop her, but...

38:55.704 --> 38:58.637
She tripped and... (Sighs)

39:00.509 --> 39:03.711
She hit her head.

39:03.712 --> 39:07.515
And when I got to her,
she was... (Sniffles)

39:07.516 --> 39:10.778
Lying in that hole.

39:10.779 --> 39:14.882
You weren't moving, honey.

39:14.883 --> 39:17.425
(Crying) And so I covered you.

39:17.426 --> 39:18.726
We... (Sniffles)

39:18.727 --> 39:22.590
(Exhales) I wanted
peace for you.

39:22.591 --> 39:24.992
(Continues crying)
I'm so sorry, baby girl.

39:24.993 --> 39:27.135
I'm so sorry.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.099
It's over now.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.643
It's over.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.108
(Whispers) Oh, my baby.

39:41.109 --> 39:43.411
(Normal voice) Ohh.

39:43.412 --> 39:45.813
Yet another shocking turn

39:45.814 --> 39:48.155
in the stone family murders,

39:48.156 --> 39:50.958
as grandmother and
mother to the victims

39:50.959 --> 39:53.791
is arrested in
connection with the death

39:53.792 --> 39:56.163
of acquitted
killer Hillary stone.

39:56.164 --> 39:59.927
The very woman who sat
behind her every day in court...

39:59.928 --> 40:01.799
Poor woman. Now
sits behind bars...

40:01.800 --> 40:03.100
We're gonna have to
put her through the system

40:03.101 --> 40:04.772
just like her daughter.

40:04.773 --> 40:07.475
I've been doing this job
for many years, people,

40:07.476 --> 40:09.807
but today is different.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.510
I've had a real wakeup call.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.683
I may have made missteps...

40:15.684 --> 40:18.716
Professionally...

40:18.717 --> 40:20.417
And personally.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.720
I think I got through
to her at least.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.421
So...

40:24.422 --> 40:27.795
I've taken a moment to reflect.

40:27.796 --> 40:29.927
You may be right.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.559
And I've realized

40:31.560 --> 40:34.001
that I am disgusted

40:34.002 --> 40:36.133
with the likes of Trent wilcoe,

40:36.134 --> 40:38.506
who set his wife on fire...

40:38.507 --> 40:39.807
(Chokes)

40:39.808 --> 40:41.438
Just because she
burnt his roast. (Laughs)

40:41.439 --> 40:42.770
Reality check, people. (Groans)

40:42.771 --> 40:44.211
I'm not the bad guy. He is.

40:44.212 --> 40:46.874
So join us next week
for the trial of the century.

40:46.875 --> 40:48.876
I fell for it just like
everybody else.

40:48.877 --> 40:53.521
Until then, goodnight
and be good.

40:53.522 --> 40:54.852
(Liquid boiling)

40:54.853 --> 40:55.923
(Blows air)

40:55.924 --> 40:57.525
I called your office.

40:57.526 --> 40:59.587
They said you were
taking a personal day?

40:59.588 --> 41:01.789
I recused myself from the bench

41:01.790 --> 41:03.591
effective immediately.

41:03.592 --> 41:05.993
Nobody wants a lame-duck judge.

41:05.994 --> 41:07.735
Mother, I-I am...

41:07.736 --> 41:09.236
(Sighs) I'm really sorry

41:09.237 --> 41:11.198
if anything I said
or... or... or did

41:11.199 --> 41:13.000
caused you to...

41:13.001 --> 41:15.673
No apology necessary.

41:15.674 --> 41:16.804
(Sighs)

41:16.805 --> 41:18.976
I'm making jam.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.848
You are making jam.

41:20.849 --> 41:22.910
Yeah, well, no
time like the present.

41:22.911 --> 41:24.752
After all, I need a new career.

41:24.753 --> 41:28.015
(Boiling continues)

41:28.016 --> 41:29.156
Mom...

41:29.157 --> 41:32.189
You remember that
accident that we had?

41:32.190 --> 41:34.061
When I was about Lacey's age,

41:34.062 --> 41:35.763
you were driving
me to swim practice,

41:35.764 --> 41:38.926
and you skidded on
that patch of wet leaves.

41:38.927 --> 41:40.067
Yeah, I hurt my knee

41:40.068 --> 41:42.900
because I rear-ended
that pickup truck.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.772
Yeah, but I was okay

41:44.773 --> 41:47.234
because you did that thing

41:47.235 --> 41:49.006
that you do with your arm...

41:49.007 --> 41:53.541
Reach out and protect me.

41:53.542 --> 41:54.982
Do you know you
did that yesterday

41:54.983 --> 41:56.784
when you stood up to that idiot?

41:56.785 --> 41:58.085
I did? Yeah.

41:58.086 --> 42:00.517
You mean I still have
some maternal instincts?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.289
(Laughs)

42:02.290 --> 42:04.291
Nothing stronger.

42:04.292 --> 42:06.123
Well, now there... there may be.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.926
(Chuckles)

42:10.859 --> 42:11.959
What, jam?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.931
(Laughing) It's mostly bourbon.

42:13.932 --> 42:16.804
(Laughs)

42:16.805 --> 42:17.965
(Mouth full) Oh, my...

42:17.966 --> 42:19.306
(Continues laughing)

42:19.307 --> 42:20.738
Whoa.

42:20.739 --> 42:21.909
(Continues laughing)

42:21.910 --> 42:23.210
(Laughing) It's good.

42:23.211 --> 42:25.643
I know. I've had it all day.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.817
(Both laugh)
