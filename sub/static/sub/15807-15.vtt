    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.140 --> 00:07.973
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.042 --> 00:10.342
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.410 --> 00:12.544
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:15.146
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.215 --> 00:17.282
¶ The skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.351 --> 00:19.752
¶ Five passengers set sail
   that day ¶

00:19.820 --> 00:22.054

¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.996 --> 00:30.796
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

Help!
         A sea monster.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.061
Help. Help. Help.
       Run for you life.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.465
It's a sea monster.
      Help. Help.

02:13.533 --> 02:17.368
Skipper, help. Sea monster.
  Help. Help. Sea monster.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.638
(Gilligan)
           'Help.'

02:22.610 --> 02:24.276
[oriental music]

02:36.223 --> 02:40.592
And then I see the saw serpent.
I mean I ser the saw seapent.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.394
Gilligan, little buddy,
         please now calm down

02:43.463 --> 02:44.429
and just tell us
                what happened.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.030
That's what I'm trying to do.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.234
I was fishing for lobster when
suddenly I saw the ser seapent.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.736
The saw serpent, a sea,
I saw a thing.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.572
Gilligan, your panic
  is perfectly understandable.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.973
It is?

02:55.041 --> 02:56.942
Naturally, anyone who saw a sea
serpent would be terrified.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.011
How come everybody's standing
 here like I didn't see one?

02:59.079 --> 03:00.712
Because you didn't.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.749
It had one big eye, long neck,
 was covered with green things.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.052
Listen to me, there is no
such thing as a sea serpent.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.920
Sailing men
from time immemorial

03:08.989 --> 03:11.589
in Norse legends, in Greek
mythology and Phoenician times

03:11.658 --> 03:13.225
all thought they saw things
that didn't exist.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.626
They did?

03:14.695 --> 03:17.429
Actually what they saw was
a giant squid or a whale

03:17.498 --> 03:20.632
or an overgrown eel or even an
octopus, which one did you see?

03:20.701 --> 03:24.335
One with one big eye, long neck,
and covered with green things.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.138
I give up.
Skipper, you talk to him.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.507
Skipper, I saw
with my own two eyes.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.675
- Gilligan, little--
     - It has one big eye.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.611
Oop.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.714
- Gilligan, do you trust me?
  - Of course, I do.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.517
Then go back down to the lagoon
and start picking more lobsters.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.086
But Skipper, what if the--

03:41.154 --> 03:42.887
Gilligan, all you have
   to do is just say to yourself

03:42.956 --> 03:44.923
"There is no sea serpent,
       there is no sea serpent.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.693
There is no sea serpent.
       There is no sea serpent!"

03:47.761 --> 03:50.061
There is no sea serpent.
There is no sea serpent.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.597
There is too a sea serpent.
There is two a sea serpent.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.699
Oh, it's you, Mr. Howell.
You scared me.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.869
I, Thurston Howell III,
       scare you? That's absurd.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.473
Thought you're sea monster with
big eye, long neck, green thing.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.075
Please, I don't think
     I look like that.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.977
Not you, Mr. Howell, the sea
 monster. That's how he looks.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.147
Well, I can help you capture
this creature from the deep, hm?

04:09.216 --> 04:10.782
Capture it?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.684
I'll take it home and give it
the freedom of my swimming pool.

04:12.753 --> 04:17.120
Can't you just picture
 my guests falling into the pool

04:17.190 --> 04:20.690
while I'm coming up astride
     a sea serpent, such laughs.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.794
- You don't believe me either.
 - No, of course not.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.663
No, I think it's just
    a giant squid or an octopus.

04:25.732 --> 04:29.434
However, if you spot
            a mermaid, sing out!

04:33.040 --> 04:35.373
Spots a mermaid..

04:35.441 --> 04:37.576
Oh, boy, I tell you..

04:40.747 --> 04:43.782
Be careful, be careful.
That point is pointy-pointy.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.287
Oh, by George, and I've got
the money to buy George.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.289
That's a Japanese sailor.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.659
- Shh.
             - Shh.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.736
- You officer?
         - Officer?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.239
I'm an officer
in 11 different companies.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.641
That's go-o-od.
        Good.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.177
I have divisions in England,
France, Italy, the Near East

05:12.245 --> 05:13.578
Far East and Middle East.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.180
It's our great honor,
           uh, to capture you.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.649
Capture me?

05:17.717 --> 05:21.352
- You prisoner. Come with me.
 - Wait a minute!

05:21.421 --> 05:23.688
That's incredible.
That's impossible.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.926
It's credible
and possible.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.995
<i> - Sayonara.</i>
          <i> - Sayona..</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:35.934
One minute, Mr. Howell was
there, next minute, poof, gone.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.737
He manages to be somewhere else
 when there's work, he's hiding.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.607
Yeah. But first time ever
in the stomach of a sea serpent.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.642
- Hi, Gilligan.
    - Hi, don't go swimming.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.645
I'm not exactly dressed for it.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.713
Ginger, you see if
          you can calm him down.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.082
- You do look kinda worried.
  - No, I'm not worried.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.852
I'm not least bit worried.
Scared, yeah, but not worried.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.220
He's upset because he thinks
    Mr. Howell has disappeared.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.423
Oh, would you like me
  to help you go look for him?

05:59.492 --> 06:01.760
- No.
  - W-well, I could go first.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.728
- It's too dangerous for a lady.
- Well, you could go first.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.197
No it's too dangerous for a man.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.065
How about you, professor?
You wanna go along with us?

06:07.134 --> 06:10.135
No, Gilligan, I'm gonna stay
 right here and finish my work.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.105
[sighs]

06:16.376 --> 06:18.710
- You still behind me, Ginger?
 - Right behind you, Gilligan.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.512
I was walking on this path
not even thinking of lobsters

06:21.581 --> 06:23.381
let alone sea monsters
and believe me

06:23.450 --> 06:25.751
I'd let alone sea monsters
if I had my choice.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.823
I was standing right over here.
 Mr. Howell came up to me

06:31.892 --> 06:35.259
and then he started walking up
 the beach and I stood here..

06:35.328 --> 06:38.630
Ginger?
      You still behind me?

06:38.699 --> 06:39.965
[Ginger screaming]

06:41.235 --> 06:43.167
- What was that?
   - It sounded like Ginger.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.703
But she's with Gilligan.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.738
Professor, I refuse
        to listen anything more.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.507
- Gilligan's a very nice boy.
 - I didn't mean it like that.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.109
Well, what's happening?

06:51.178 --> 06:54.078
I was telling that her husband
has been eaten by a sea serpent.

06:54.147 --> 06:58.482
Oh, that's silly, Thurston
wasn't even dressed for dinner.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.818
Did you say he was eaten
    by a sea serpent?

07:00.887 --> 07:04.822
- No, no, no. Gilligan said it.
- Oh, that's different.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.526
Stay and wait for the Skipper,
 send him to the lagoon.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.394
Come on, Mary Ann.
  I'll explain it on the way.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.463
I'll save you, Ginger.
     I'll save you.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.500
Don't give up,
        Ginger. Ginger?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.168
Hold your breath.
       I'll save you.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.639
- You don't believe him, do you?
- No, but there may be trouble.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.241
- You stay here.
        - Why?

07:23.310 --> 07:25.610
Because I'm gonna find out
exactly what's happening.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.979
- I'll save you. I'll save you.
- Gilligan.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.749
- Gilligan, what happened?
 - The sea serpent ate Ginger.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.552
- Why did she scream?
     - Because it hurts.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.920
Gilligan, you get
               hold of yourself

07:35.989 --> 07:38.657
and tell me step by step
        exactly what happened?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.825
Well, Ginger and me came down
from camp to the beach.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.695
That is, I did.
Ginger became an appetizer.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.664
In other words, she was standing
there where Mary Ann is now?

07:46.733 --> 07:49.367
- Where Mary Ann isn't.
- Gilligan, for the last time..

07:49.436 --> 07:50.702
[dramatic music]

07:50.771 --> 07:53.205
Mary Ann.
                       Mary Ann.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.875
Mary Ann.
                       Mary Ann.

07:56.943 --> 08:00.712
Professor, it's just no use.
Mary Ann's become a salad.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.148
There's a perfectly logical
     and normal reason

08:03.216 --> 08:04.449
for what's happening.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.151
- Uh-huh, a hungry sea serpent.
- Nonsense.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.986
Maybe, you're right.
After Mr. Howell, Ginger

08:08.055 --> 08:10.021
and Mary Ann,
he's probably full.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.823
I'll stand guard here,
          you go back to camp

08:11.891 --> 08:13.458
and help Mrs. Howell
            find the Skipper.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.059
- You'll stay right here?
   - I promise.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.395
- Even if you're eaten?
 - Gilligan, will you hurry up?

08:17.464 --> 08:18.697
Right.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.366
Mary Ann.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.202
Hello, Skipper.
        Mrs. Howell..

08:25.271 --> 08:26.638
Oh.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.973
Oh, poor Mrs. Howell.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.810
Well, at least,
   she's with Mr. Howell now.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.477
Gilligan.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.048
Oh, Skipper,
     am I glad to see you.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.585
- I told you to go get lobsters.
- Oh, is that a big mistake.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.486
- W-where is everybody?
    - Out to lunch.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.489
- Out for lunch?
        - The hard way.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.358
Gilligan, please, now why don't
you start making some sense?

08:47.427 --> 08:49.060
Right, make some sense.
         Where shall I begin?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.863
Start at the beginning,
that's always a good place.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.765
- I was catching lobster, right?
- Right.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.399
- I saw the sea serpent, right?
- Right.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.670
Then he ate Mr. Howell, Ginger,
Mary Ann, and poor Mrs. Howell.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.805
Gilligan, I'm not gonna lose
my temper, am I?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.807
I'm not gonna get angry
and blow my top, am I?

09:02.876 --> 09:06.111
- No, I'll make you start over.
- You don't believe me, do you?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.913
Don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but no, I don't believe you.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.949
Then I don't wanna
              talk about it.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.985
- Now, tell me what happened.
 - Nothing happened.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.986
Gilligan, where
is everybody gone?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.756
You and me are here.
 Professor's down at the beach.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.491
The rest, they all got
          eaten up by a--

09:20.560 --> 09:23.028
- Ah.
    - Sea serpent, so there.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.096
I suppose that you saw them
eaten by the sea serpent?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.598
- No, not exactly.
- Now, we're getting someplace.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.167
- We are.
         - Yes, we are.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.235
We're getting down at the beach
and find the professor. C'mon.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.405
- I'm not going back down there.
- Alright, suit yourself.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.975
Don't forget to say hello
       to Mrs. Howell for me.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.058
Very ingenious.
Very ingenious.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.659
Well, I'm glad
               that you approve.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.095
You notice how he's got
    this constructed?

09:58.164 --> 10:02.100
If we try to squeeze through or
push or pull these bamboo poles

10:02.169 --> 10:05.170
it tightens the wire and pulls
 the pin out of the grenade.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.304
And pow, splash, pow!

10:07.373 --> 10:08.840
Must you be so graphic?

10:08.908 --> 10:11.575
You don't understand,
 it could be to our advantage.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.444
The "pow" or the "splash"?

10:13.512 --> 10:16.414
I meant we might be able to
reason with the Japanese sailor.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.483
Only a person of intelligence
 could have constructed

10:18.551 --> 10:21.052
this barricade as quickly
   and efficiently as he did.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.153
- He's smarter than we are.
  - What do you mean?

10:23.222 --> 10:25.924
Well, he's outside.
      We're inside.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.826
[whistling]

10:28.894 --> 10:30.895
Oh, he speaks English.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.000
[birds chirping]

10:36.069 --> 10:39.704
Alright, now.
         Time for interrogation.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.973
Now, look, this is really
all quite unnecessary.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.743
The war has been over
for more than 20 years.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.410
I've heard of sore losers,
   but he's ridiculous.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.847
[speaking Japanese]

10:51.050 --> 10:52.550
You don't call me ridiculous.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.619
Surely you must've heard the
ending of the war on your radio.

10:55.688 --> 11:00.358
Radio broke in 19...42.

11:00.427 --> 11:04.028
Transmitter, too.
Pretty soon, I get spare parts.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.831
- When?
    - Oh, when I get leave.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.602
Best spare parts come Japan.
  Cheaper, too.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.538
Have you heard about
            our discount houses?

11:13.607 --> 11:15.907
Using code.
      Don't talk in code.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.610
Just give me information
of supply depot, uh, ammunition

11:19.679 --> 11:21.179
headquarters, everything.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.681
Look, there is no ammunition.
There are no headquarters.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.382
The war is over.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.519
What's the matter with you?
  You think I'm dumbbell? Huh?

11:28.588 --> 11:33.224
I know American.
  I went to American college.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.227
I graduated...UCLA.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.763
- That explains everything.
  - What do you mean?

11:38.831 --> 11:40.932
Well, he's obviously
not a Harvard man.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.201
Look at the cut
of his trousers.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.438
[dramatic music]

11:52.345 --> 11:54.712
I don't believe it.
             I don't believe it.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.147
I believe it.
It's right here.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.115
I haven't seen one of these
     since the war.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.951
Which one is it?
The Monitor or the Merrimack?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.986
Not the Civil War,
              you lunkhead!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.888
Look at the name
                of the boat.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.092
Somebody sure has
terrible handwriting.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.862
I can't make out
USS anything.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.964
Gilligan,
         it's Japanese.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.400
This clears a lot of things.
    It's in papers all the time.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.769
You read where they left some
 Japanese on a deserted island.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.271
They don't know
        the war is over yet.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.139
It looks a lot bigger
   when it was a sea serpent.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.208
They must have the rest
   of the group held captive.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.744
- It's up to us to save 'em.
  - That's right, Gilligan.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.112
All I have to do
       is get in the sub

12:28.181 --> 12:29.814
sail to Hawaii
      and bring back help.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.049
- You're a genius, Skipper.
  - I know.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.452
With the sub gone,
         it wouldn't make sense.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.088
That sailor wouldn't dare
 kill you and rest of the group.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.991
- Me? How do I get captured?
- I have faith in you, Gilligan.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.427
- Oh, thanks, Skipper.
     - Oops.

12:43.496 --> 12:47.765
- Bon voyage. Have a good trip.
- Wait a minute, Gilligan.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.934
- I'm stuck.
      - You can't get in?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.536
- No, Gilligan.
      - You can't get out?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.605
- No, Gilligan.
 - Oh, that's why you're stuck.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.307
Yes, Gilligan.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.944
Here, some coconut oil
to make you slippery.

13:00.013 --> 13:04.014
- Coconut oil is gooey.
- It'll make you more slippery.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.384
Here, come on.
Let's go.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.154
- See? Here we go.
      - Hey, you working!

13:10.223 --> 13:12.791
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.029
- Turning me the wrong way.
  - Oh, oh, here.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.336
See it works.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.006
That's right, little buddy,
  it worked fine. Now get ready.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.808
You're gonna have
       to captain the submarine.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.244
- Me?
             - Yes.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.914
Get down there
              behind that wheel.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.849
It's simple, just drive it
      like an automobile.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.385
- Are you sure?
        - Yes.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.721
Just look at the dashboard
    and follow the instructions.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.022
If you say so.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.357
Head Northwest
          and you'll hit Hawaii.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.359
You can depend on me,
     Skipper.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.927
I wish you hadn't
      said that, Gilligan.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.362
Just remember,
your life is in my hands.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.765
Wish you hadn't
       said that either.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.134
Here we go.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.004
Good luck, little buddy.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.111
[water gurgling]

14:13.086 --> 14:15.119
I forgot it was a convertible.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.397
No, no.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.235
Hey, you, there are
     seven people captured

15:05.304 --> 15:07.538
on an island by
       a Japanese sailor.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.240
Hey, you.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.243
Look, I know exactly where
they are, come on, come on.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.045
Come on, hurry up, we gotta
hurry, come on, let's go.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.914
Follow me, I know
exactly where they are.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.149
Gilligan.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.052
Skipper?
How did you get to Hawaii?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.187
- You never left the lagoon.
  - I didn't?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.124
- I told you to head northwest.
- I know that.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.126
Well, then, why didn't
         you do what I told you?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.695
You didn't tell what northwest
looked like in Japanese.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.030
- Japanese?
          - Yeah.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.098
All those letters
down there written like that.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.933
Never thought of that.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.235
Well, Gilligan, we gotta find
that sailor, have him teach you.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.537
- I could learn real fast.
   - Good, Gilligan.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.375
Now, if you were a Japanese
  sailor, where would you be?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.843
In Tokyo.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.613
I mean here
    on the island, Gilligan.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.781
We got to find
           that Japanese sailor.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.917
Come on.

15:52.986 --> 15:56.587
Would you settle say for general
manager in my European sales?

15:56.656 --> 15:59.056
I'm Japanese sailor.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.959
Imperial Navy,
    I'm loyal to my Emperor.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.728
Loyalty is something
I admire in every manager.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.466
It's a positive virtue but would
you be loyal say to $50,000?

16:08.534 --> 16:14.938
No, no, no, but thank you
   for important information.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.974
Information?
What information?

16:17.043 --> 16:19.610
That war is nearly over

16:19.679 --> 16:23.114
and that American Army
     is in bad, bad shape.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.016
I never said the American Army
was in bad shape.

16:26.085 --> 16:29.120
Must be, to make men
      like you officer.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.991
I go talk to
                  lady prisoner.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.360
<i> Arigato!</i>

16:37.130 --> 16:39.197
[oriental music]

16:55.715 --> 16:57.448
[music continues]

17:02.989 --> 17:05.923
You're married
              to big mouth, huh?

17:05.992 --> 17:08.192
I'm Mrs. Thurston Howell III.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.060
Have been two other like that?

17:10.128 --> 17:12.296
There may be
     a Thurston Howell IV.

17:13.632 --> 17:17.134
Wonder why Emperor want
    United States.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.236
I demand you let us
    out of here immediately.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.505
Oh, no, can't do.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.807
Then I have nothing more
    to say to you.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.176
You, you camera bug.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.379
I change my mind.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.515
Then you're gonna
       let us go free?

17:31.584 --> 17:32.916
No.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.952
I was going
    to torture your husband.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.721
But now I'll leave
       that to you.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.091
Oh, Mary Ann,
I think I've been insulted.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.260
Ah, you, you're not scared, huh?

17:43.329 --> 17:46.864
- Maybe you give me information?
- I'd rather die.

17:46.933 --> 17:47.998
That could be arranged.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.500
Ooh.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.269
Oh, hey, don't go away. No.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.973
American movie star, she hurt.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.709
Oh, I-I think
            I sprained my ankle.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.012
- Oh, it's too bad.
     - Maybe if you rub it.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.650
I-I mean men's hands
            are so strong.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.355
I was the strongest sailor
in whole navy.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.259
I broke five boards,
one inch thick, with karate.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.730
And you're handsome too.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.099
Handsome?
           Oh, no.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.168
Yes, you are.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.403
Good looking, maybe.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.373
Very, very good rooking.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.141
You good looking too.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.543
Thanks.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.878
You know if you were
     back in Hollywood now

18:34.947 --> 18:36.881
they'd go crazy about you?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.850
Hollywood?
         Me in movies?

18:39.919 --> 18:42.953
Oh, yes, there's
     lots and lots of parts

18:43.022 --> 18:45.590
for big, strong Japanese men.

18:48.127 --> 18:52.997
I could play a movie star
 like, uh, Robert Taylor, huh?

18:53.066 --> 18:55.366
Or like Robert Montgomery, huh?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.702
How about the other one,
    Lloyd Bridges?

18:58.971 --> 19:04.775
Yes, you've got such smooth hair
and a handsome face.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.143
And good looking?

19:06.211 --> 19:08.346
(both)
       Very good rooking.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.782
And strong hands.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.817
Oh, please.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.320
You steam glasses.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.455
Ginger, I wouldn't
              do that.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.724
Why not?

19:19.792 --> 19:23.060
I don't think he's had
a shore leave in over 20 years.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.463
- I demand that you release us.
- After all, the war is over.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.033
And I won't speak
      to you again if you don't.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.834
How you say
"no" in English?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.937
Ah. No!

19:37.010 --> 19:38.775
[birds chirping]

19:38.844 --> 19:42.513
I haven't sleep for 48 hours.
 I must sleep.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.882
You seem to be forgetting the
rules of the Geneva Conference.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.850
Officers are entitled
to special treatment.

19:46.919 --> 19:51.221
Oh, well, you get
      special prison camp.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.624
I'm referring
to the cocktail hour.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.159
You sure he's on your side?

19:55.228 --> 19:56.727
Not always.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.164
I sleep over there.

20:00.232 --> 20:01.731
Don't you escape, huh?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.133
Escape?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.003
The way you fixed this chicken
coop, how am I gonna escape?

20:06.072 --> 20:08.205
Oh, true.
           True.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.441
Say, how did you
               learn to do this?

20:10.509 --> 20:13.310
- Pictures.
          - Pictures?

20:13.379 --> 20:17.348
American pictures
       with John Wayne.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.358
- He's up there.
        - Oh.

20:29.795 --> 20:33.564
- What are we gonna do?
 - Watch and see what he does.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.366
- Keep an eye on him.
 - Yeah. What are you gonna do?

20:36.435 --> 20:39.236
- I'm gonna let them out.
   - Okay.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.340
- If he makes a move, whistle.
- Oh, like this?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.741
[whistles]

Don't worry, Skipper.
       Your life is in my hands.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.359
I wish you wouldn't
keep saying that.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.761
Now, watch him.

[snoring]

21:17.409 --> 21:20.744
- Oh, am I glad--
       - Shh.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.680
I'll have you
out of here in no time.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.350
Skipper, it'll take you a week
  to saw through those

21:26.418 --> 21:28.052
even if you had a saw.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.560
- No, don't, don't do that.
  - Why not?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.562
Because of "pow" and "smash"

21:38.631 --> 21:41.399
and other gory details
I can't go into now.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.000
'Cause he's got it
           rigged with grenades.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.069
- The slightest pressure and--
 - "Pow."

   - Shh.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.827
Don't bother me,
        I'm doing fine.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.433
- Hi, girls.
          - Hi.

23:22.501 --> 23:25.035
Hold this, will you?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.771
[metal clinking]

23:32.544 --> 23:33.844
Gilligan.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.725
Here, Skipper, use this,
    it'll be faster.

23:48.794 --> 23:49.894
Thanks.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.142
He's gone.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.511
He was the only one who could've
taught us to run that submarine.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.779
It can't be, Skipper.
     It can't be.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.615
I think he's headed
      for Hollywood.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.684
We gotta get to that sub
    before he does. Come on.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.635
Extremely poor seamanship.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.971
He'd be drummed out of
      the Sunnybrook Yacht Club.

24:34.039 --> 24:37.007
I can't understand it.
He's driving like he was drunk.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.109
He's not drunk, Skipper.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.978
He not have glasses on.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.192
¶ They're here for
      a long, long time ¶

24:56.261 --> 24:58.828
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:58.897 --> 25:00.730
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:00.799 --> 25:02.866
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:02.935 --> 25:04.935
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:05.003 --> 25:07.037
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:07.106 --> 25:09.172
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:09.241 --> 25:11.641
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcar ¶

25:11.710 --> 25:13.710
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:13.779 --> 25:15.979
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:16.048 --> 25:18.048
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:18.116 --> 25:20.417
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:20.486 --> 25:22.253
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:22.321 --> 25:24.888
¶ From seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:24.956 --> 25:27.091
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶
