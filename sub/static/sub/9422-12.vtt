WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:05.105
Change. Change.

00:05.105 --> 00:08.041
Please change.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.111
Oh, please don't let me
be pregnant.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.080
(Inhales deeply)

00:15.115 --> 00:18.051
Not the answer
I was looking for.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.053
Karen.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.055
Nick. Hey, hello. Hi.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.992
Hey. Uh, look,
I'm sorry to barge in,

00:24.992 --> 00:27.094
but your mother said I could--
I could wake you up.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.096
I guess I'm a--
I'm a little late.
(Under breath) You're not
the only one.

00:29.096 --> 00:31.131
What?
(Normal voice) What?

00:31.131 --> 00:34.034
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm excellent. Why?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.003
Come here.
Why?

00:36.003 --> 00:38.071
What are you doing
this weekend?

00:38.071 --> 00:40.073
I'm... I don't know. Why?

00:40.073 --> 00:43.043
Well, I thought we could
drive up to the berkshires.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.046
I... I booked a suite
at the elm court.
Oh!

00:46.046 --> 00:50.017
Oh, this weekend
is not I-ideal for me.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.052
Okay.
What about next weekend?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.054
How about next month?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.989
Next month?
Boy. Wow, that's--

00:55.989 --> 00:57.991
wow, we really are
taking things slow.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.093
I know. It's good.
Let's shoot for next month.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.096
Okay. Next month it is.

01:03.096 --> 01:06.133
Perfect. It's gonna be...
(Singsong voice) Sexy.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.068
(Door opens)

01:08.068 --> 01:09.102
(Door closes)

01:09.102 --> 01:11.104
(Nola)
It doesn't make any sense.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.107
Why would Simon pick you out of
all the people in the world

01:14.107 --> 01:16.109
to help him
fake his own death?

01:16.109 --> 01:19.046
I just--
who cares
why Simon picked me?

01:19.046 --> 01:21.048
What matters is,
once I do it,

01:21.048 --> 01:23.050
you will get
your brother back

01:23.050 --> 01:25.052
from wherever Simon's
got him hidden away,

01:25.052 --> 01:28.989
and I...
Will be your big kahuna.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.058
That's all
I'm thinking about.

01:31.058 --> 01:34.061
And all I'm thinking about
is that this is a trap.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.997
Look, I know that you want
to be "action Jeremy,"

01:36.997 --> 01:40.100
but you are world famous
for being a party boy.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.103
You managed to fool everyone
with your fake amnesia,

01:43.103 --> 01:45.105
but you're not Jason Bourne.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.076
Hey, I am whoever I need to be
to help the woman I love.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.017
(Footsteps approach)

01:57.017 --> 01:58.085
What are you doing here?

01:58.085 --> 02:00.020
Karen, I'm sorry.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.022
I didn't mean to scare you.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.024
I was just on my way
to see Tripp.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.092
Your father and I

02:05.092 --> 02:08.027
are hosting a...
A gathering tomorrow night,

02:08.027 --> 02:11.098
rolling out our bio-fuel.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.101
Um, listen,
is this a bad time?

02:14.101 --> 02:17.104
Oh, anytime I see you
is a bad time.
Come on, Karen.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.106
You're not still holding
a grudge, are you?

02:19.106 --> 02:22.042
Why, because you sold me
to my own father

02:22.042 --> 02:24.011
on my wedding day?

02:24.011 --> 02:26.079
(Laughs) Heck no.
Okay, Karen. It all
worked out for the best.

02:26.079 --> 02:30.017
I've got half of the company
and... and you have Nick.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.020
Hey, listen, if you want to let
yourself off the hook, go ahead,

02:33.020 --> 02:35.055
but don't expect me
to join you.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.090
You may be able to forget
little things

02:37.090 --> 02:39.059
like ruining my life,
but I'm never going to.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.094
Because you see, Simon,
for me, it's not over.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.031
I'm gonna remember
what you did to me

02:44.031 --> 02:47.000
every single day
for the rest of my life.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.071
I was that important
to you?

02:51.071 --> 02:54.007
I mean... (Laughs)
You got married four times.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.045
I was that important to you?

02:58.045 --> 03:00.047
(Sighs)

03:00.047 --> 03:02.049
There's not something
going on here

03:02.049 --> 03:04.985
you're not telling me,
is there?

03:04.985 --> 03:08.121
Karen, it's time
for our appoint--

03:08.121 --> 03:10.057
(elevator bell dings)

03:10.057 --> 03:12.092
Why, Mr. elder. Hello.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.094
Hello, Letitia.
Hello.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.029
Are you all right?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.032
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just get out of here.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.101
(Elevator doors close)

03:24.004 --> 03:26.006
(Footsteps approach)

03:26.006 --> 03:28.108
Hey, wifey.
What's cooking?

03:28.108 --> 03:30.043
Not much.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.013
I'm working on my sermon
for Sunday.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.016
The text is, uh,
1 corinthians, chapter 13.

03:36.016 --> 03:40.087
You know, "love is patient,
love is kind."

03:40.087 --> 03:42.990
Love "endures all th--" ow!

03:42.990 --> 03:45.092
So how does it work
when you say a prayer

03:45.092 --> 03:47.127
at a state dinner anyway?

03:47.127 --> 03:50.130
I mean, when you went down
to Washington last week

03:50.130 --> 03:53.100
to perform the benediction
at Patrick's state dinner

03:53.100 --> 03:57.037
and you looked out over
all those powerful heads,

03:57.037 --> 03:59.039
what exactly did you say?

03:59.039 --> 04:02.009
I started with "dear lord."

04:02.009 --> 04:03.076
Really?

04:03.076 --> 04:07.047
You sure it wasn't,
"oh, baby, you look so hot"?

04:07.047 --> 04:09.116
What's your problem?

04:12.052 --> 04:13.086
This.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.991
What, you want to have sex?

04:17.991 --> 04:21.094
This isn't exactly
setting the mood.
I found it in your suitcase.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.096
What was it doing there?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.998
St--

04:24.998 --> 04:27.067
oh, you know what?
I don't care.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.037
Go and use it
with somebody else.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.072
I want you
out of here, now.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.077
Wait a minute. You can't
throw me out of my own house.

04:37.077 --> 04:41.048
Oh, yeah? I already cleared it
with your mother, baby cakes.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.050
Watch me.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.052
(Singsong voice)
Oh, Maria.

04:45.052 --> 04:49.022
(Normal voice) Could you please
pack Mr. Darling's condoms?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.058
He's moving out.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.026
(Telephone rings)

04:53.026 --> 04:55.062
(Woman) Dr. Reese's office.
Please hold.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.997
When you're
feeling up to it,

04:56.997 --> 04:59.066
I'm gonna have dinner
brought in from Artisanal.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.001
Mm.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.069
Osso Bucco.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.004
Mmm.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.076
The only thing I'm gonna want
once I'm feeling up to it

05:09.076 --> 05:12.045
is an extremely dry
triple Martini...

05:12.045 --> 05:15.048
And a time machine, so I can
go back to the day I met Simon

05:15.048 --> 05:18.085
and stop this whole baby mess
before it started.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.021
You're doing
the right thing, dear.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.091
(Door opens)

05:24.091 --> 05:26.026
Karen Darling?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.028
The doctor
will see you now.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.065
(Exhales deeply)

05:32.065 --> 05:35.068
So there should be a pretty
impressive turnout tomorrow.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.038
The port authority is sending
people, coastal commissioner.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.073
And the press?
All the journalists who
at one time or another

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
came out against the bio-fuel

05:42.075 --> 05:44.111
have kindly
rethought their positions.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.113
Hmm. So it looks like
we're ready

05:46.113 --> 05:48.115
to roll this baby out,
gentlemen.
Yeah, almost.

05:48.115 --> 05:51.051
Almost?
There's a problem?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.987
Well, the partnership agreement
between the two of you

05:53.987 --> 05:55.088
has obviously been executed,

05:55.088 --> 05:57.090
but we are still waiting
on your signature

05:57.090 --> 05:59.026
on the final transfer

05:59.026 --> 06:01.995
of the bio-fuel patent
to Darling enterprises.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.131
Oh, yeah. Right.
Well, that was an oversight.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.100
So just put
the papers together, Nick,

06:07.100 --> 06:10.070
and, uh,
I'll gladly sign it over.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.040
All right.
I'll do it later today.
Good.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.074
Tripp...
(Clears throat)

06:14.074 --> 06:17.010
I am proud
to have you as my partner,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.046
regardless
of how it began.
(Chuckles)

06:19.046 --> 06:21.081
Nick.
Simon.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.051
All right.
Take care, guys.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.053
(Door closes)

06:26.053 --> 06:28.088
What's up?

06:30.090 --> 06:33.060
Mr. elder...
Is about to part company

06:33.060 --> 06:38.065
with hundreds and hundreds
of millions of dollars.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.134
I think
under those circumstances...

06:41.134 --> 06:44.104
That he's being
extraordinarily accommodating.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.040
I'd have to say I agree.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.077
Well, perhaps we should
find out why.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.045
Done.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.019
Knock knock.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.056
Congressman Watley.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.058
Um... sit. Please.

07:05.058 --> 07:09.029
I, um, didn't know
you were in New York City.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.065
Yeah. Wife and kids
are in town for a few days.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.067
Want to do
a little shopping,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.069
kick-start the old economy,
you know?

07:16.069 --> 07:20.007
Senator, look, I wanted to
stop by and apologize

07:20.007 --> 07:22.075
for the way
we left things the other day.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.077
I realize that, uh...
(Chuckles)

07:24.077 --> 07:27.047
I misunderstood
your interest in me.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.049
That's, uh... all right.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.018
It's... fine.

07:31.018 --> 07:35.022
I do hope that you'll take
the fact that I made an advance

07:35.022 --> 07:37.124
as nothing more
than a compliment,

07:37.124 --> 07:40.027
which... is what it was.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.128
Thank you.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.131
Anyway...
If you are interested,

07:44.131 --> 07:47.067
I would love to have dinner.

07:47.067 --> 07:51.004
Congressman, I've already
told you that I'm not--

07:51.004 --> 07:54.007
to discuss Darling enterprises'
new bio-fuel initiative.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.009
Senator, you still
do need the support

07:56.009 --> 07:58.111
of the energy committee,
don't ya?

07:58.111 --> 08:01.014
No.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.116
No?
Y-yes. I mean,
of course, yes.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.053
Yes.
And we appreciate
that support, congressman.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.087
Absolutely.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.022
Good. (Laughs)

08:09.022 --> 08:11.091
Okay, uh,
I'll check my schedule,

08:11.091 --> 08:13.093
and I'll have my office
be in touch.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.096
You do that.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.099
Are you sure
you're all right?

08:19.099 --> 08:22.035
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just--
I'm a little shaky.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.037
What exactly went wrong?

08:24.037 --> 08:27.040
Nothing. I just, you know,
I couldn't go through with it.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.043
Oh--
oh, mom, please don't make
a drama out of this.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.111
Well, certainly not, dear.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.114
When have you ever known me
to make a drama?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.116
No, we'll get you home,
and, uh,

08:36.116 --> 08:38.118
I'll draw you a bath,

08:38.118 --> 08:40.120
and, uh,
we'll figure something out.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.121
I just--
I hate now that Simon

08:42.121 --> 08:45.092
is forever gonna be
a part of my life.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.094
Oh, he won't be, dear.
Ma'am.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.029
I promise.
Thank you.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.065
It'll all be just fine.

08:54.034 --> 08:58.038
Oh, my.
It's really coming down.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.107
Not a good day
for an abortion.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
Here, I'll get it.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.082
♪♪♪

09:21.028 --> 09:22.095
(Knock on door)

09:22.095 --> 09:26.033
I'm coming. God!

09:26.033 --> 09:27.067
(Banging on door)

09:27.067 --> 09:29.136
I said I'm coming.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.075
Brian.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.111
Well, don't look
so happy to see me.
You going somewhere?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.115
Here.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.051
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
Don't even try. I know
you have the extra room

09:46.086 --> 09:48.121
now that you're down a wife.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.091
Lucky bastard.
Wait a minute.
What happened?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.126
(Sighs)

09:53.126 --> 09:55.128
Andrea kicked me out.

09:55.128 --> 09:58.999
She found out
about me and Mei ling.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.034
Well, you didn't even
sleep with Mei ling.
Yeah, I know.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.037
She found an unopened rubber
in my suitcase.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.007
Well, we gotta--we gotta
explain things to her.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.009
(Scoffs)
That's ironic, huh?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.011
I went down there

10:11.011 --> 10:13.080
to have safe sex
with my ex-wife,

10:13.080 --> 10:16.083
I don't have any,
and I still get busted.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.018
(Opens zipper)

10:18.018 --> 10:20.087
There is a...

10:20.087 --> 10:24.091
Another bedroom in this
little Dollhouse, right?

10:24.091 --> 10:27.060
Yeah, there's Kiki's,
but she uses it.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.096
Okay, good.
You stay there.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.098
Brian, come on.
This is New York City.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.133
There are dozens
of great hotels,

10:33.133 --> 10:36.069
many of which
your family owns.
And I have
a position to uphold,

10:36.069 --> 10:39.039
not only as a Darling,
but as a man of the cloth.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.041
I check in someplace,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.076
and it's gonna be
all over "page six."

10:47.047 --> 10:50.050
Come on.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.085
Help a half brother out.

10:52.085 --> 10:56.123
All right. Fine.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.992
(Tripp)
An invitation to dinner--

10:58.992 --> 11:01.094
what possible harm
could come from that?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.030
It's a date, dad.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.031
(Sighs)

11:04.031 --> 11:05.098
A man date.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.101
Well, you've made your feelings
clear, haven't you?

11:08.101 --> 11:12.039
You've established
your orientation, have you not?
Yeah, well,

11:12.039 --> 11:15.042
he's not the kind of gay
that takes no for an answer.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.109
Guy.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.112
Guy.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.114
I'm sorry. I'm just...

11:21.114 --> 11:24.084
I'm...
A little rattled here.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.086
Just calm down.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.121
I mean, look, there's gotta be
some other way

11:28.121 --> 11:30.123
we can push this
through the committee.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.126
Uh, we've got other contacts
in Washington, right?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.128
Of course we do,
but at this point,

11:35.128 --> 11:38.065
representative Watley
is still our most prominent,

11:38.065 --> 11:41.101
our most
vehemently vocal critic.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.037
If we could have his vote,
if we could have

11:44.037 --> 11:47.040
his public support
at the rollout tomorrow night,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.109
th-that would be invaluable.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.111
Well, what if he gets tipsy

11:51.111 --> 11:54.014
and he starts putting the moves
on me again, then what?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.049
Come on.
It's a crowded restaurant.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.087
Oh, do the best you can.
Will you, Patrick, please?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.091
(Simon)
My car blew up!

12:04.091 --> 12:07.094
And I was standing
20 feet away.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.997
Yeah, right. Accidents happen.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.999
But see,
when my private investigator

12:11.999 --> 12:14.001
finds weapons grade c-4

12:14.001 --> 12:16.069
mixed in with the remains
of my bodyguard,

12:16.069 --> 12:19.072
the old "accidents happen"
theory kind of goes boom--

12:19.072 --> 12:21.041
out the window.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.010
No, I'm--I'm not accusing you.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.013
I'm asking you
an honest question.

12:26.013 --> 12:29.082
(Sighs) Okay, okay. Okay.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.020
If you say you weren't
behind it, then...

12:33.020 --> 12:35.055
I'm sorry.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.024
I am.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.059
I said...

12:40.994 --> 12:42.095
(Dial tone droning)

12:42.095 --> 12:43.997
Problems?

12:43.997 --> 12:45.065
(Telephone beeps)

12:45.065 --> 12:47.000
Who was that?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.135
Don't you worry about it.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.137
And what are you
doing here?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.105
The question is,

12:52.105 --> 12:55.008
what are you doing
with Jeremy?

12:55.008 --> 12:57.110
Oh. (Chuckles)

12:57.110 --> 13:00.047
He told you our plan.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.051
Well, it's very simple,
really.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.020
He wants to be
your knight in shining armor,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.088
you want your brother,

13:08.088 --> 13:11.024
and I have a need
to make a graceful exit.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.994
Saw the opportunity
for some synergy.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.062
I know you, Simon.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.998
Your brand of synergy
profits no one but you.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.034
Find someone else to help you
with your little exit strategy.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.102
Look, nola, I'll admit,

13:22.102 --> 13:25.105
Jeremy's not an obvious choice
for this kind of project,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.075
but things are difficult
right now.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.011
I'm not sure I can trust
my own people,

13:31.011 --> 13:33.046
and Jeremy's commitment
to finding your brother

13:33.046 --> 13:35.048
is, uh, strong
to say the least.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.050
No, he's the man
for the job.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.987
Unless...

13:39.987 --> 13:42.055
You have someone else
in mind.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.091
(Whispers)
You son of a bitch.

13:44.091 --> 13:47.027
(Normal voice) So that's
your plan all along, right?

13:47.027 --> 13:49.062
Compromise Jeremy as a way
of forcing me to do it?

13:49.062 --> 13:52.032
Is that your way
of saying yes?

13:52.032 --> 13:55.068
Tell me where my brother is
right now, and I'll do it.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.004
Yeah, okay.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.038
Nola...

13:58.038 --> 14:01.008
Listen to me.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.076
When my death is reported
on an encrypted page

14:03.076 --> 14:06.046
on "the New York times"
web site,

14:06.046 --> 14:08.115
a file on this drive
will open,

14:08.115 --> 14:11.051
disclosing
your brother's location.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.120
Not until.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.023
Go on.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.059
All right.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.029
Here's a schematic
of my building.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.096
This...

14:23.096 --> 14:26.033
Come here.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.100
(Chuckles) All right.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.037
The whole shebang
will go down tomorrow night

14:30.037 --> 14:33.040
after the rollout
of my bio-fuel.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.075
By midnight tomorrow,

14:35.075 --> 14:39.012
you will have
your brother...

14:39.012 --> 14:42.015
And I will be,
for all intents and purposes...

14:42.015 --> 14:45.052
Dead.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.031
Nola lyons.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.101
Nick George.
What are you doing coming out
of Simon elder's building?

15:01.101 --> 15:04.071
Oh, I was just making sure
all the I's were dotted

15:04.071 --> 15:07.040
and the t's were crossed
for tomorrow night.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.009
I wanted to assure Simon

15:09.009 --> 15:11.011
that his bio-fuel has
Patrick's long-term support.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.013
Oh, you came all the way
across town

15:13.013 --> 15:15.015
to deliver that message
in person?

15:15.015 --> 15:17.050
That's quite a commitment.
Well, the job demands
nothing less.

15:17.050 --> 15:21.021
You of all people should
know that. Excuse me.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.023
So where do I sign?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.024
Here...

15:24.024 --> 15:25.092
Here and here.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.094
Wow.

15:27.094 --> 15:30.063
Ten years of hard work
has finally paid off.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.065
So what if I have to
share the credit

15:32.065 --> 15:35.002
with Tripp Darling, right?

15:35.002 --> 15:38.005
The world's a better place,
and I'm a satisfied man.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.106
You must be, too.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.074
What do you mean?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.043
Well, unless I'm mistaken,

15:43.043 --> 15:45.112
I think congratulations
are in order.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.048
I'd suggest we have a cigar,

15:48.048 --> 15:51.084
but I don't think you're really
a cigar-smoking kind of guy.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.086
What are you talking about?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.055
Karen hasn't told you?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.024
Hasn't told me what?

15:59.026 --> 16:02.029
You know what? I'll let her
tell you herself.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.998
The last thing I want
is to ruin the surprise.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.133
(Papers rustling)

16:06.133 --> 16:08.068
(Letitia) Karen...

16:08.068 --> 16:09.136
Come out of there.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.104
I had Maria make
some whoopie pies--

16:11.104 --> 16:14.107
chocolate and pumpkin,
your favorite.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.044
Come out.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.079
What am I gonna do?

16:19.079 --> 16:22.115
Well... do you want
to have the baby?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.084
This baby?
Mm-hmm.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.020
This way? I...

16:27.020 --> 16:29.089
I mean... God, mom,
Nick and I,

16:29.089 --> 16:33.026
we were finally on the verge
of... something,

16:33.026 --> 16:36.029
and now I'm pregnant with
my crazy ex-boyfriend's baby.

16:36.029 --> 16:40.033
No, I don't want to have
this baby!

16:43.103 --> 16:45.105
So... do you want...

16:45.105 --> 16:48.108
No. No.
I can't do that either.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.110
I mean...

16:50.110 --> 16:55.082
Oh, what if this is
my only chance?

16:55.082 --> 16:59.052
Well, then... your options
are severely limited.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.122
You can only...
You can only be unhappy.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.096
So what are you gonna do?

17:09.096 --> 17:14.034
I don't know.
I just... I don't know.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.069
(Sighs)

17:16.069 --> 17:18.070
Being rich doesn't
protect you from anything,

17:18.070 --> 17:20.007
does it?

17:20.007 --> 17:23.076
No, dear, it doesn't.
Not at all.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.080
(Indistinct conversations)

17:28.080 --> 17:30.117
(Instrumental jazz playing)

17:30.117 --> 17:32.119
Patrick.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.021
Charles.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.056
I am so glad
that you could make it.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.025
And you must be--

17:38.025 --> 17:40.060
this is my wife. This is Dana.
This is Patrick.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.029
I've heard wonderful things.

17:42.029 --> 17:44.064
You have my Charles
under a spell. (Laughs)
(Laughs)

17:44.064 --> 17:46.066
Lovely to meet you.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.035
Please sit down.

17:48.035 --> 17:51.038
So the kids are at the hotel
with a nanny.

17:51.038 --> 17:52.105
They're watching a movie,
so--

17:52.105 --> 17:55.042
I crashed. (Laughs)
I hope you don't hate me.

17:55.042 --> 17:57.110
Not at all.
More the merrier.

17:57.110 --> 18:01.014
What the hell is going on?
You went behind my back?

18:01.014 --> 18:03.050
I'm not gonna let Simon
hurt you.
I can take care of myself.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.019
No, you can't. Simon walked me
through the plan--

18:06.019 --> 18:08.021
the broken windowpane
in the subbasement,

18:08.021 --> 18:11.091
the code that supposedly
disables the security cameras.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.094
My guess is that it goes
straight to the police.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.096
He's trying to frame you.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.033
Okay. Fine.
Let's say it's a setup.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.036
Then why is you being
the rat in Simon elder's maze

18:23.036 --> 18:25.038
any better than me?

18:25.038 --> 18:28.108
"A," I know my way around that
building better than you do.
Okay.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.077
"B," his people know me.

18:30.077 --> 18:33.080
If they catch me,
I can justify my presence.
That's true.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.083
And "c," it's just the way
it has to be. Okay?

18:36.083 --> 18:39.052
I lost my father to Simon.
I've nearly lost my brother.

18:39.052 --> 18:42.089
I won't lose you, too.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.068
Thank you.
(Laughs)

18:55.068 --> 18:59.039
Manufacturing this fuel is
safer than you think, Charles.

18:59.039 --> 19:02.075
The environmental impact
studies...

19:02.075 --> 19:04.077
What, Patrick? What?

19:04.077 --> 19:07.014
Uh, the environmental
impact studies

19:07.014 --> 19:10.017
that you're basing
your statements on

19:10.017 --> 19:12.019
don't...
Tell the whole story.

19:12.019 --> 19:14.087
Uh...
Not by a long shot.

19:14.087 --> 19:17.024
What about the flash point?

19:17.024 --> 19:19.059
Yeah, what about
the flash point? Sounds hot.

19:19.059 --> 19:21.061
(Charles) Is there any way

19:21.061 --> 19:24.998
that you could push
the flash point up?
Yeah, can you push it up
a bit, pat?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.100
When something goes wrong,
this stuff burns like crazy.

19:27.100 --> 19:31.038
And I'm not going to have
an uncontrollable blaze

19:31.038 --> 19:33.040
at the foot of Manhattan.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.009
Yeah, a blaze to the foot
would be bad.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.045
Ooh.

19:41.048 --> 19:44.017
Um...

19:44.017 --> 19:45.118
(Chuckles)

19:45.118 --> 19:47.988
Charles...

19:47.988 --> 19:49.056
(Chuckles)

19:49.056 --> 19:51.058
My parents are hosting
a little soiree

19:51.058 --> 19:53.126
at their place tomorrow night
for investors,

19:53.126 --> 19:55.062
potential partners.

19:55.062 --> 19:58.098
We would love it
if you two could come.
Well, then maybe we will.

19:58.098 --> 20:00.100
(Laughs)

20:00.100 --> 20:02.102
(Chuckles)

20:02.102 --> 20:06.006
Uh, there's Jack. Jack!
I'll just be a--be a second.

20:06.006 --> 20:07.040
Okay.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.076
Charles, good to see you.

20:09.076 --> 20:12.045
What the hell
are you doing?

20:12.045 --> 20:14.047
I'm giving you
a present, silly.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.084
(Whispers) Your panties?

20:19.019 --> 20:23.056
Wh-what am I supposed
to do with these?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.058
There you go.
Thank you, Hannah.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.060
Only the best steak
in town. Am I right?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.996
Hear, hear.

20:28.996 --> 20:30.998
Sweetheart, I'm gonna
have the driver

20:30.998 --> 20:33.000
bring the car around, okay?
Okay.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.101
All right.
(Sighs)

20:34.101 --> 20:37.070
Is there something
you'd like to say to me?

20:37.070 --> 20:40.040
My husband hasn't touched me
in over ten years.
Dana... stop it.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.108
Why?

20:41.108 --> 20:43.110
Because I can't do this,

20:43.110 --> 20:48.048
even though I would really...
Like to.

20:48.048 --> 20:49.116
Kiss me good night,
please.

20:51.118 --> 20:53.020
(Sighs)

20:53.020 --> 20:54.087
(Chuckles)

21:00.060 --> 21:03.063
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.069
(Whispers)
That was a mistake.

21:09.069 --> 21:12.039
Best mistake
I've made in years.

21:12.039 --> 21:14.074
(Door opens)
Here he comes.

21:14.074 --> 21:18.078
Sweetheart, it is time to hit
the old road. (Laughs)

21:18.078 --> 21:19.079
(Laughs)

21:19.079 --> 21:21.014
(Laughs)

21:21.014 --> 21:24.051
Don't forget. Tomorrow night,
uh, my parents' place.

21:24.051 --> 21:26.053
Take care.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.002
Hi.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.103
Hi.

21:43.103 --> 21:45.105
I didn't see you there.

21:45.105 --> 21:47.007
Here I am.

21:47.007 --> 21:50.043
Got your message.
Sorry I didn't call you back.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.111
It's been a crazy day.

21:51.111 --> 21:53.046
I see.

21:55.082 --> 21:57.050
Can we talk?

21:57.050 --> 21:58.118
About what?

21:58.118 --> 22:00.120
About the good news.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.122
Simon congratulated me,

22:02.122 --> 22:04.124
and he mentioned good news
and cigars,

22:04.124 --> 22:06.126
and... since I didn't know

22:06.126 --> 22:08.128
what the hell
he was talking about,

22:08.128 --> 22:12.032
I thought maybe
you could fill me in.

22:12.032 --> 22:14.001
I'm pregnant.

22:17.037 --> 22:20.073
Okay.

22:20.073 --> 22:24.077
And you--you told him
that the baby's mine?

22:24.077 --> 22:26.079
Because it's impossible.
We haven't had sex.

22:26.079 --> 22:28.081
No, I didn't--I didn't
tell Simon anything.

22:28.081 --> 22:31.018
(Sighs) So what,
he's just guessing about--

22:31.018 --> 22:33.053
I-I don't--I don't know.

22:33.053 --> 22:35.055
Trust me, he's the last person
I would tell.

22:35.055 --> 22:37.057
Because it's his, isn't it?

22:39.026 --> 22:41.094
It's Simon's baby.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.030
Yeah.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.098
Why didn't you tell me?

22:45.098 --> 22:48.001
I mean, don't you think
this is information

22:48.001 --> 22:50.003
that I would find
kind of relevant?

22:50.003 --> 22:53.006
Excuse me. I'm a little
freaked out right now.
(Sighs)

22:53.006 --> 22:56.043
And I'm pretty scared of what
this is gonna do to us.

22:58.111 --> 23:01.114
Can you do this with me?

23:01.114 --> 23:03.050
Can I?

23:03.050 --> 23:05.052
I know, I know, honey...

23:05.052 --> 23:07.087
It's--it's not easy.

23:07.087 --> 23:09.089
And I know this isn't...
(Sighs)

23:09.089 --> 23:11.992
This isn't how something
should start out.

23:11.992 --> 23:14.995
But nothing we've ever done
has gone according to plan,

23:14.995 --> 23:17.130
has it?

23:17.130 --> 23:21.068
I've waited so long, Nick--
you know that--so long for us.

23:21.068 --> 23:24.004
So have I, Karen. I--
look, I love you.

23:26.073 --> 23:28.075
This is why
I didn't tell you.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.077
Well, this is
a hell of a thing

23:30.077 --> 23:32.079
for me
to wrap my mind around.

23:32.079 --> 23:35.082
Forgive me if I can't
just say yes immediately.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.084
Okay.

23:40.053 --> 23:43.023
Well, then can you
say yes ever?

23:46.026 --> 23:48.996
I don't know.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.101
I'm sorry.

23:57.004 --> 23:59.039
But I don't know.

24:10.117 --> 24:15.055
(Brian)
♪ am I only dreaming ♪

24:15.055 --> 24:18.091
♪ or is this burning ♪

24:18.091 --> 24:20.027
(Nick) Brian!

24:20.027 --> 24:24.031
♪ An eternal flame? ♪

24:24.031 --> 24:26.066
Brian!
What?!

24:26.066 --> 24:28.101
Take those damn things off,
I beg you.

24:28.101 --> 24:31.071
What do you want?
I was--I was working.

24:31.071 --> 24:33.106
Look, I had to listen to you
sing all night long.

24:33.106 --> 24:36.109
Just enough already.
It just helps me concentrate.
I--I'm working on this sermon.

24:36.109 --> 24:40.113
W-would you listen to this?
It's about love.

24:40.113 --> 24:43.083
"Love never seeks its own way.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.085
"Love is"...
What the hell is this?!

24:45.085 --> 24:48.021
It's coffee.
It's your free-trade swill.

24:48.021 --> 24:50.023
Yeah?
Well, it tastes like bleach.

24:50.023 --> 24:53.026
Well, I cleaned out
the coffeemaker with bleach

24:53.026 --> 24:55.128
'cause it was dirty.
This place is a pigsty.
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry

24:55.128 --> 24:58.098
that I don't have a full-time
staff of cooks and maids

24:58.098 --> 25:00.100
like you're used to
at home, Brian.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.036
Maybe you should've thought
of that before you invaded.

25:03.036 --> 25:05.038
No, maybe you should've
friggin' hired somebody!

25:05.038 --> 25:07.040
Planning, Nick--it's key!

25:07.040 --> 25:09.076
(Exhales deeply)

25:09.076 --> 25:11.044
Look--
Nick!

25:11.044 --> 25:13.013
What?

25:13.013 --> 25:15.115
Will you talk to her
for me?

25:15.115 --> 25:17.017
Please.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.052
All right, I will, but--
thanks.

25:19.052 --> 25:22.022
(Simon) You know,
sometimes life surprises you.

25:22.022 --> 25:25.058
And creates a path where
there was never one before.

25:25.058 --> 25:27.060
This partnership
with Tripp Darling

25:27.060 --> 25:29.029
and Darling enterprises was,

25:29.029 --> 25:31.999
for me, one such surprise.

25:31.999 --> 25:34.001
(Tripp) So together,

25:34.001 --> 25:36.003
we thank you
for joining us tonight

25:36.003 --> 25:38.105
to celebrate the launch
of mpg-5000--

25:38.105 --> 25:42.075
a 21st-century bio-fuel
which,

25:42.075 --> 25:44.077
with the help of
visionary friends here

25:44.077 --> 25:48.015
and in Washington,
of course,

25:48.015 --> 25:51.118
will be ready for production
at the end of the year.
To mpg-5000--

25:51.118 --> 25:54.054
the fuel of the future.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.122
Hear, hear.

25:58.091 --> 26:02.029
(Jazz orchestra playing)

26:02.029 --> 26:03.030
Jeremy.

26:03.030 --> 26:05.032
Hey. Nick, right?

26:05.032 --> 26:06.099
Yeah.

26:06.099 --> 26:09.069
Listen, what do you know about
Simon elder and nola lyons?

26:09.069 --> 26:11.104
Nola... works for Patrick

26:11.104 --> 26:14.074
and... Simon works with dad.

26:14.074 --> 26:17.077
Are you sure she doesn't have
any ties with Simon

26:17.077 --> 26:19.012
that preexist
both those relationships?

26:19.012 --> 26:20.113
I don't know. Remember?

26:20.113 --> 26:23.050
Me got the amnesia.
Knock it off, Jeremy.

26:23.050 --> 26:26.019
What?
Look, I know
you don't have amnesia.

26:26.019 --> 26:29.056
Oh, come on, I do.
I forget stuff.
Hey, hey, hey, we don't
have to discuss it, okay?

26:29.056 --> 26:30.123
Just tell me the truth.

26:30.123 --> 26:33.093
Is there a connection
between nola and Simon?

26:33.093 --> 26:36.063
Okay, they might both be
in Oprah's book club together,

26:36.063 --> 26:39.066
but other than that,
I don't know.
Thanks a lot, Jeremy.

26:39.066 --> 26:42.069
(Indistinct conversations)

26:42.069 --> 26:44.037
(Dana) Mm. Mm-hmm.

26:44.037 --> 26:47.107
Congressman...
Mrs. Watley.

26:47.107 --> 26:50.110
I'm... so glad
you decided to attend.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.045
We are, too.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.047
Miss me?

26:54.047 --> 26:55.115
(Music continues)

26:55.115 --> 26:57.117
(Tripp)
Hello, congressman.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.052
Hello, Tripp.
Mrs. Watley.

26:59.052 --> 27:02.055
I'm so pleased that my son
was able to persuade you

27:02.055 --> 27:05.125
to join us tonight.
Happy to lend our support.
Timing is everything.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.127
Well, if you could spare me
a minute,

27:07.127 --> 27:10.063
I'd like to introduce you
to my associate--Simon elder.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.065
Certainly, certainly.
You, uh...

27:12.065 --> 27:15.068
(Lowered voice)
You can handle my wife, right?
I'll do my best.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.005
(Normal voice) Be back...
In a little bit, sweetie.

27:18.005 --> 27:19.039
Okay.

27:19.039 --> 27:22.042
(Tripp)
He's just through there.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.079
Hey,
there's my favorite girl.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.048
Hi, Nick. How's it going?

27:28.048 --> 27:30.050
You know he moved in
with me, right?

27:30.050 --> 27:32.119
Yeah, of course.
He's the father of my son.

27:32.119 --> 27:35.022
I need to know where he is.

27:35.022 --> 27:36.089
Just... take him back.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.025
Not on your life.

27:38.025 --> 27:39.092
Andrea, look,

27:39.092 --> 27:42.095
nothing happened between he
and Mei ling Hwa, I swear.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.097
I don't care, Nick.

27:44.097 --> 27:47.100
Well, I can't
live with him, period.
Well, you're gonna have to,

27:47.100 --> 27:50.003
because until Brian grows up

27:50.003 --> 27:53.006
and realizes
that being in a relationship

27:53.006 --> 27:55.008
doesn't mean zigzagging

27:55.008 --> 27:57.077
between saving
and betraying somebody,

27:57.077 --> 28:00.047
but that it's actually about
being continually present

28:00.047 --> 28:03.050
and continually faithful...

28:03.050 --> 28:05.052
I'm not gonna take him back.

28:05.052 --> 28:06.119
Andrea, I--
all right, fine.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.121
But--but he's going
to a hotel,

28:08.121 --> 28:10.123
because I don't care
what the papers say.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.093
(Laughs) Nick, he could've
always gone to a hotel.

28:13.093 --> 28:15.996
The papers don't matter.
Don't you get it?

28:15.996 --> 28:18.999
Of all the places in the world
that he could've run to

28:18.999 --> 28:21.101
and of all the people...

28:21.101 --> 28:23.103
He chose you.

28:23.103 --> 28:25.105
(Chuckles) Lucky me.

28:25.105 --> 28:27.107
He's your half brother.

28:27.107 --> 28:30.043
Deal with him.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.113
(Sighs)

28:33.113 --> 28:35.115
(Dana)
It's very impressive.

28:35.115 --> 28:38.118
I'm looking forward
to my next fill-up.

28:38.118 --> 28:42.022
Do not give me
your panties here.

28:42.022 --> 28:43.090
That's impossible.

28:43.090 --> 28:46.059
I'm not wearing any.

28:48.095 --> 28:51.098
The argyle hotel, room 909.

28:51.098 --> 28:53.100
Come see me later.

28:53.100 --> 28:57.004
Everything but the door
will be wide-open.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.111
Whoa.

29:07.014 --> 29:10.017
(Piano music playing)

29:10.017 --> 29:12.119
Scotch, lowland, 18-year.

29:12.119 --> 29:14.087
I have a drink, thank you.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.056
Oh, yeah.

29:16.056 --> 29:18.125
What--what is that?

29:18.125 --> 29:20.060
Mmm.

29:20.060 --> 29:23.030
Ginger ale.
That's interesting.

29:23.030 --> 29:25.032
Yeah,
I'm trying to stay sober

29:25.032 --> 29:28.001
so I don't do something foolish,
like kill you.

29:28.001 --> 29:30.103
Mm. (Laughs)
(Laughs)

29:30.103 --> 29:33.106
Excuse me.
So how far along are we,
six weeks?

29:33.106 --> 29:35.042
Oh, into our breakup?

29:35.042 --> 29:38.045
I don't know. Honestly,
I haven't been keeping track.

29:38.045 --> 29:40.080
How far are we
into our pregnancy?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.082
Mm. Come here.

29:46.019 --> 29:47.120
Hmm?

29:47.120 --> 29:50.057
How did you know?

29:50.057 --> 29:52.025
I didn't,

29:52.025 --> 29:54.094
not for certain,
not until just now.

29:54.094 --> 29:57.030
(Chuckle) I mean,
I figured it wasn't Nick's

29:57.030 --> 29:59.032
given his reaction.

29:59.032 --> 30:02.102
So what were you thinking, that
you were gonna have this baby,

30:02.102 --> 30:05.072
and I would never find out?
Simon.

30:05.072 --> 30:07.074
Hmm?
You broke my heart.

30:07.074 --> 30:10.043
Why don't you
just leave me alone?

30:10.043 --> 30:13.080
Because...
Things have changed.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.115
You're pregnant
with my baby,

30:15.115 --> 30:17.084
and you tried
to hide it from me.

30:17.084 --> 30:21.021
This changes everything.
I'm not gonna let you
within 10 feet

30:21.021 --> 30:22.990
of this baby, Simon.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.092
See, sweetheart...

30:25.092 --> 30:28.028
That's not
your decision to make.

30:28.028 --> 30:31.031
I swear to you,
no matter where you go,

30:31.031 --> 30:34.034
no matter what you do,

30:34.034 --> 30:37.070
I will always be a part
of this baby's life.

30:37.070 --> 30:40.040
And there is nothing you
or your family can do

30:40.040 --> 30:42.009
to stop me.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.077
Nothing.

31:02.062 --> 31:05.065
(Indistinct conversations)

31:09.069 --> 31:11.104
Where's nola?

31:11.104 --> 31:15.008
Don't worry. She'll be
at your place, 11:00.

31:16.109 --> 31:19.046
You'll get dead. Don't worry.
There's been
a change of plans.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.081
What, you just want
to be maimed?

31:21.081 --> 31:24.084
I have decided not to die,
Jeremy, at least not yet.

31:24.084 --> 31:26.119
I'm calling it off.
Tell your girl.

31:26.119 --> 31:28.121
Wait a second. I thought
you needed to flee.

31:28.121 --> 31:30.123
Yeah, but something important
has happened now

31:30.123 --> 31:33.026
that makes me need
to stick around.
What?

31:33.026 --> 31:35.028
(Laughs) Don't you
worry about that.

31:35.028 --> 31:37.030
You'll hear about it
soon enough.

31:37.030 --> 31:39.066
Hey, to mergers
and unexpected arrivals

31:39.066 --> 31:41.101
and to your family.

31:45.072 --> 31:47.007
And to mine.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.108
(Glasses clink)

31:52.045 --> 31:56.016
(Indistinct conversations)

31:56.016 --> 31:59.019
Hey, so you speak to Andrea?
What'd she say?

31:59.019 --> 32:01.088
Is she missing me?
Not exactly.

32:01.088 --> 32:04.124
Gosh. (Chuckles)
She's a bitch.

32:04.124 --> 32:06.126
Look, she's not a bitch,
Brian.

32:06.126 --> 32:09.997
You just...
You hurt her feelings,

32:09.997 --> 32:12.065
and now she doesn't trust you.

32:12.065 --> 32:14.101
Hey, I know
this is unorthodox,

32:14.101 --> 32:16.103
but you are
a man of the cloth.

32:16.103 --> 32:19.006
Can I...
Can I confide in you?

32:19.006 --> 32:22.009
Well, give it a shot.
We'll see.

32:22.009 --> 32:24.077
(Nick) Come here.

32:26.113 --> 32:29.082
Karen's pregnant.

32:29.082 --> 32:31.018
Holy--

32:31.018 --> 32:32.119
yeah, I know.

32:32.119 --> 32:34.087
And it's yours?

32:34.087 --> 32:36.056
No.

32:36.056 --> 32:38.058
Well, whose is it?

32:38.058 --> 32:42.029
Well, I guess it could be
half the fortune 500's, right?

32:42.029 --> 32:44.064
(Chuckles)
It's Simon elder's.

32:44.064 --> 32:46.066
Oh, man. Give me a...

32:46.066 --> 32:48.068
Hey, Brian.

32:48.068 --> 32:50.103
And she still wants me
to be with her.

32:50.103 --> 32:53.073
What, and raise
the devil's spawn?

32:53.073 --> 32:55.075
(Chuckles) Yeah,
something like that.

32:55.075 --> 32:57.110
Well... you know,
I seem to remember

32:57.110 --> 33:01.014
when our plane
was about to crash,

33:01.014 --> 33:04.051
you did say something to her
about being "the one."

33:04.051 --> 33:07.087
Look, I thought
we were gonna die, Brian.

33:07.087 --> 33:09.022
Well, was it true?

33:09.022 --> 33:11.124
Yeah, it was true.

33:11.124 --> 33:13.126
You know what
the good book says?

33:13.126 --> 33:14.995
What?

33:14.995 --> 33:16.096
"Love is patient,

33:16.096 --> 33:20.000
love is kind."

33:20.000 --> 33:22.002
Love "endures all things."

33:22.002 --> 33:23.070
"Love endures all things"?

33:23.070 --> 33:26.039
My guess is
it at least tries.

33:26.039 --> 33:29.042
Hmm.

33:31.044 --> 33:33.080
(Sighs)

33:36.049 --> 33:38.085
I'll see you at home.

33:42.022 --> 33:45.058
Mamacita... great news.

33:45.058 --> 33:46.994
Tell me.

33:46.994 --> 33:49.997
You got the stand-down order.
I just got word from Simon.

33:49.997 --> 33:51.098
He's like scrooge
on Christmas morning,

33:51.098 --> 33:53.033
bubbling with life.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.035
What did he say exactly?

33:55.035 --> 33:57.037
He called the whole thing off.

33:57.037 --> 33:59.039
No fake break-in,
no fake kidnapping,

33:59.039 --> 34:01.074
no fake murder.

34:01.074 --> 34:02.109
Done.

34:02.109 --> 34:04.111
Let's go back to my room
and celebrate.

34:04.111 --> 34:07.114
Wait. No.
This doesn't make any sense.
What?

34:07.114 --> 34:10.083
My brother. This is
my only chance to get him back.

34:10.083 --> 34:13.020
His plan may be off,
but mine is still on.

34:13.020 --> 34:15.088
Okay, then I'm coming
with you.

34:15.088 --> 34:18.025
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

34:18.025 --> 34:20.027
Look, Nick is out there
asking questions

34:20.027 --> 34:21.094
and Simon is a freak.

34:21.094 --> 34:24.031
I'm not gonna let
something bad happen to you.

34:24.031 --> 34:26.033
I'm not saying you can't be
Lara croft,

34:26.033 --> 34:28.101
just let me be
your Terry Sheridan.

34:28.101 --> 34:31.103
(Nola) Who?

34:31.103 --> 34:34.074
(Indistinct conversations)

34:34.074 --> 34:36.043
(Sighs) Congressman.

34:36.043 --> 34:38.045
Senator, great party.

34:38.045 --> 34:39.112
Thank you.

34:39.112 --> 34:41.114
Um, got a minute?

34:41.114 --> 34:44.117
Look, Patrick, if this is
about your little bio-fuel thing,

34:44.117 --> 34:46.119
don't worry about it.
You got my vote.

34:46.119 --> 34:48.054
No, I-I know that.

34:48.054 --> 34:51.058
Uh, and we are all
very grateful to you for that.

34:51.058 --> 34:52.125
But seeing as...

34:52.125 --> 34:55.094
Well, we're both
on the same side now,

34:55.094 --> 34:58.031
I just... I-I don't really
know how to--

34:58.031 --> 35:00.033
hey, spit it out.

35:02.035 --> 35:05.005
It's... about your wife.

35:05.005 --> 35:08.008
What about my wife?

35:08.008 --> 35:11.011
The other night at dinner,
um...

35:11.011 --> 35:12.079
She kissed me,

35:12.079 --> 35:14.081
and it was all very innocent,
and I--

35:14.081 --> 35:16.083
of course I stopped her
right away,

35:16.083 --> 35:18.118
but I just wanted you--
(Laughs) I'm sorry.

35:18.118 --> 35:20.053
No, I am serious.

35:20.053 --> 35:23.023
I don't want this
to become a problem.

35:23.023 --> 35:25.025
(Laughs) Senator,
I know that you're serious,

35:25.025 --> 35:27.094
but believe me, this?
This is not a problem.

35:27.094 --> 35:29.062
(Laughs)

35:29.062 --> 35:31.064
What are you saying?

35:31.064 --> 35:34.067
Dana and I love each other
very much, all right?

35:34.067 --> 35:37.004
We're partners
in every aspect of our lives

35:37.004 --> 35:38.071
except for one.

35:38.071 --> 35:41.008
So we have a... we have
a little arrangement.

35:41.008 --> 35:45.045
Now if we meet a great guy
that she and I both like,

35:45.045 --> 35:47.080
we hope that maybe
he likes one of us.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.082
Now you obviously
were not into me,

35:49.082 --> 35:52.052
so Dana and I had
a little talk about it

35:52.052 --> 35:53.120
and figured--

35:53.120 --> 35:55.122
what are--what are you
telling me?

35:55.122 --> 35:58.058
You... you want me
to sleep with your wife?

35:58.058 --> 36:00.127
She gave you the key
to the hotel room, right?

36:00.127 --> 36:02.062
Right?
Yeah.

36:02.062 --> 36:05.065
You use that key, senator.

36:05.065 --> 36:09.036
Because I certainly...

36:09.036 --> 36:11.071
Will not be
sleeping there tonight.

36:15.008 --> 36:18.011
(Nick) Karen.
Oh, what do you want?
What do you want?

36:18.011 --> 36:21.048
Hey, hey, what is--
what is wrong? What happened?
Simon knows the baby's his.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.050
And he says he's not
gonna leave me alone.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.053
He wants to be a part of
the baby's life no matter what.

36:26.053 --> 36:29.056
(Voice breaks) And I don't even
know what I want anymore.
Hey, calm down. Karen, please.
Just stop, okay?

36:29.056 --> 36:32.059
Nick, this is not your problem.
You said so yourself.

36:32.059 --> 36:35.062
Well, I also said
that I love you.

36:35.062 --> 36:37.064
And I do.
And I want to help.

36:37.064 --> 36:40.067
So let me
take care of this for you.

36:40.067 --> 36:44.104
Hey, I can
take care of this.

36:44.104 --> 36:47.074
(Sniffles)
What are you gonna do?

36:47.074 --> 36:51.011
I will talk to Simon,
and I will let him know

36:51.011 --> 36:53.080
that it is
in his best interests

36:53.080 --> 36:55.082
to stay the hell away.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.084
All right?

37:02.122 --> 37:05.092
I can't figure out
the access code,

37:05.092 --> 37:08.028
"swan" doesn't seem
to work.

37:08.028 --> 37:09.096
Try "jewelry."

37:09.096 --> 37:11.098
I didn't bring you along
for comic relief.

37:11.098 --> 37:14.034
I need to open up
a video link with my brother

37:14.034 --> 37:17.104
so that we can find out
where he is, and then--
(Door closes)

37:17.104 --> 37:19.106
(Whispers) Jeremy, hide!

37:28.115 --> 37:30.083
What are you doing here?

37:30.083 --> 37:33.086
Your idiot boyfriend didn't
give you my message, did he?

37:33.086 --> 37:35.088
My brother--where is he?

37:35.088 --> 37:38.058
Okay, you made a mistake
in coming here--

37:38.058 --> 37:39.993
a big mistake.

37:39.993 --> 37:43.096
How are you gonna come--
(Grunts)

37:43.096 --> 37:45.132
(Exhales deeply) Dude.

37:55.042 --> 37:58.045
(Objects clattering)

38:02.115 --> 38:05.018
Good. You're awake.

38:05.018 --> 38:06.119
Now are you glad
I came along?

38:06.119 --> 38:09.089
Yeah. Just keeping looking
for that access code.

38:09.089 --> 38:11.058
You two better hurry up,

38:11.058 --> 38:14.027
'cause my people will be here
any minute now.

38:14.027 --> 38:16.997
You gave your people
the night off, remember?

38:16.997 --> 38:20.033
Or didn't you?
Told you it was a setup.

38:20.033 --> 38:22.102
Hey, Jeremy,
I'll tell you what,

38:22.102 --> 38:27.007
if you untie me now, I promise
I won't kill her or the kid.

38:27.007 --> 38:28.041
(Grunts)

38:28.041 --> 38:30.043
Oh, man.

38:30.043 --> 38:34.047
(Laughs)
There's hope for you yet.

38:34.047 --> 38:39.019
Nola... the bottom
of the drawer comes out.

38:39.019 --> 38:41.121
I found it.
I found the access code.

38:41.121 --> 38:44.024
(Keyboard keys click)

39:03.076 --> 39:05.112
Hello?

39:08.048 --> 39:09.082
Dana?

39:09.082 --> 39:11.084
Hey.

39:14.054 --> 39:15.122
Dana...

39:15.122 --> 39:19.092
I--I've been going through
a bit of a tough time lately.

39:19.092 --> 39:24.064
Um, I recently...
Lost my wife, as you know,

39:24.064 --> 39:28.068
and... someone else...

39:28.068 --> 39:33.040
To whom I was, uh...

39:33.040 --> 39:35.108
Very close.

39:35.108 --> 39:38.045
Um... and, uh...

39:38.045 --> 39:40.113
Look, I know I--
I came all the way here,

39:40.113 --> 39:44.051
but... I just--
I-I-I don't know...

39:44.051 --> 39:46.119
If I'm ready for...

39:46.119 --> 39:49.089
Something like this.

39:49.089 --> 39:51.091
That's okay.

39:51.091 --> 39:54.027
You don't need to explain,
Patrick.

39:54.027 --> 39:56.029
Thank you.

39:56.029 --> 39:58.065
It's just sex.

40:08.041 --> 40:09.109
(Patrick exhales)

40:09.109 --> 40:11.078
(Whispers) Here we go.

40:19.987 --> 40:21.989
Listen, uh...

40:21.989 --> 40:23.123
(Camera lens whirs)

40:23.123 --> 40:26.026
Uh...

40:26.026 --> 40:29.029
(Whirs)

40:31.031 --> 40:33.066
(Sighs)

40:33.066 --> 40:35.102
Come on. Hurry up.
We gotta get outta here

40:35.102 --> 40:38.071
before his Russian circus freaks
show up.
It's processing.

40:38.071 --> 40:40.107
You know,
for a computer gazillionaire,

40:40.107 --> 40:44.044
your Internet
is surprisingly slow.
It's coming on.
Something's happening.

40:44.044 --> 40:47.047
Oh, my God.
Justin! Justin! It's him.

40:47.047 --> 40:49.116
Hello? Nola, is that you?

40:49.116 --> 40:51.118
Hi! Hi. Are you all right?

40:51.118 --> 40:54.087
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

40:54.087 --> 40:56.123
What the hell
just happened, Simon?
I have no idea.

40:56.123 --> 41:00.027
He must have been in a hurry
to get somewhere.
Where is he?

41:00.027 --> 41:02.029
Tell me where he is
right now!

41:02.029 --> 41:04.064
I have no--
where the hell is he?!

41:04.064 --> 41:06.066
Oh!

41:09.002 --> 41:11.071
(Gasps)

41:11.071 --> 41:12.105
(Grunts)

41:12.105 --> 41:14.107
(Groans)

41:16.076 --> 41:19.079
I swear to God,
I will kill you.

41:19.079 --> 41:22.015
(Groans)

41:22.015 --> 41:25.052
Oh, jeez. Jeez Louise.
This is--this is not good.

41:25.052 --> 41:28.088
Nick.

41:28.088 --> 41:30.817
What the hell
is going on here?
