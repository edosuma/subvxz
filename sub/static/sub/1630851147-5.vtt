00:42.083 --> 00:43.083
THE WATCHER: <i>Time.</i>

00:46.541 --> 00:47.541
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.208 --> 00:50.208
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.041 --> 00:55.166
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.750 --> 01:04.500
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility.</i>

01:06.750 --> 01:10.791
<i>Where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:12.916 --> 01:16.333
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:19.916 --> 01:21.458
<i>I am The Watcher.</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:26.875
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.125 --> 01:29.208
<i>Follow me</i>

01:30.250 --> 01:31.833
<i>and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.166 --> 01:36.666
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:47.541 --> 01:50.958
<i>Dr. Bruce Banner,</i>
<i>the human hiding within the Hulk,</i>

01:51.041 --> 01:54.166
<i>fell from the stars to warn humanity</i>
<i>of imminent danger.</i>

01:55.000 --> 01:59.125
<i>But the world he found</i>
<i>was not one he recognized.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:07.375
(PANTING) Thanos is coming. He's coming.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.333
Uh...

02:11.416 --> 02:12.416
Hello?

02:13.958 --> 02:15.500
Anyone got any clothes?

02:19.583 --> 02:20.583
Oh, God.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.500
Was I too late?

02:32.791 --> 02:33.916
Ah, jeez.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.583
Come on, big guy, time to go green.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.708
Oh, no.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.791
Hear me and rejoice.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.500
Come out! Come out! Come out!

02:47.583 --> 02:49.416
(GROWLS) No!

02:49.500 --> 02:51.083
What do you mean, "no"?

02:51.166 --> 02:55.708
You are about to die
at the hands of the children of...

02:58.833 --> 03:01.666
Tony? (CHUCKLES)
Boy, are you guys screwed!

03:01.750 --> 03:03.125
Huh?

03:08.083 --> 03:09.791
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, Iron Man!

03:14.166 --> 03:16.208
Wait, what are you guys... That's...

03:18.958 --> 03:22.333
Uh, that sorta seems like overkill.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.291
Whoa!

03:37.083 --> 03:38.666
It's... Oh.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.333
I can't believe it.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.375
BANNER: No, no, no, no. Oh. Oh!

03:54.750 --> 03:56.375
Oh! (GRUNTS)

03:56.458 --> 03:58.166
Don't eat me!

04:02.250 --> 04:04.958
Oh! Ugh! Ah.

04:13.583 --> 04:14.666
Oh, no.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.833
No, no, no. Don't eat me. Don't eat me.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.000
I'm... I'm vegan.

04:21.916 --> 04:25.083
Oh, holy crow. Oh, come on! What now?

04:26.291 --> 04:28.791
Oh, God. Okay. This is disgusting.

04:36.791 --> 04:41.375
Oh, no. Oh! I'm gonna vomit.
I'm definitely gonna vomit.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.041
THE WASP: Go! You'll be safe with them.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.500
With the giant ants? Who are you?

04:45.583 --> 04:46.958
THE WASP: All that's left.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.291
Whoa!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.916
-Don't eat me, don't eat me, don't eat...
-Hey, relax.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.750
I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

04:52.833 --> 04:56.083
Oh, yeah? Well, then, what the hell
happened to the neighborhood?

04:56.166 --> 04:58.541
THE WATCHER:
<i>Like too many great catastrophes,</i>

04:58.625 --> 05:02.375
<i>this one sprang</i>
<i>from a place of love and hope.</i>

05:04.916 --> 05:08.833
<i>Two weeks earlier, Dr. Hank Pym</i>
<i>journeyed into the quantum realm,</i>

05:08.916 --> 05:11.250
<i>searching for his long-lost wife.</i>

05:11.333 --> 05:13.125
<i>But in this universe,</i>

05:13.208 --> 05:17.416
<i>Janet Van Dyne contracted a quantum virus</i>
<i>that corrupted her brain.</i>

05:17.500 --> 05:22.166
<i>So when she finally reunited</i>
<i>with her husband after 30 long years...</i>

05:24.833 --> 05:26.916
-(GRUNTS)
<i>-Oof. That happened.</i>

05:30.291 --> 05:35.541
<i>Alas, Hope Van Dyne's long-awaited</i>
<i>family reunion was not to be.</i>

05:36.458 --> 05:38.166
-Mom?
-SCOTT: Hi, Miss Van Dyne.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.208
Holy... What the... Hank! No.

05:48.958 --> 05:52.833
THE WATCHER: <i>Within 24 hours,</i>
<i>the entire Pacific Northwest was infected.</i>

05:55.583 --> 06:00.333
<i>Ironically, it was the Avengers' heroism</i>
<i>that sealed humanity's fate.</i>

06:00.416 --> 06:01.541
On my mark.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.625
Ow!

06:05.708 --> 06:09.416
THE WATCHER: <i>Because once Earth's</i>
<i>mightiest heroes joined the infected,</i>

06:10.333 --> 06:12.416
<i>no one else stood a chance.</i>

06:13.458 --> 06:16.166
<i>Unless, of course, they knew the rules.</i>

06:25.333 --> 06:28.416
New York! Home of the Mets,
the Chrysler Building,

06:28.500 --> 06:33.083
those ladies from <i>Sex and the City,</i>
and now, the zombie apocalypse!

06:33.166 --> 06:35.375
If you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere.

06:35.458 --> 06:37.500
But first, you have to not get eaten.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.083
Step one. Long sleeves.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.625
Do I have to be wearing this?

06:45.708 --> 06:47.375
Come on.
The safety of the world depends on it.

06:47.458 --> 06:48.541
And action, zombies!

06:48.625 --> 06:50.041
Here I come. Bad zombie.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.958
PETER: The zombie virus
is passed through saliva.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.125
So the less skin you're showing,
the less there is to bite.

07:00.208 --> 07:04.291
Step two, hygiene. Zombies are attracted
to the smell of human flesh.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.916
So the less pheromones you give off,
mmm, the better.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.208
But just one catch.

07:08.291 --> 07:10.875
You're never more vulnerable
than in your birthday suit.

07:10.958 --> 07:12.000
The sneak attack!

07:16.041 --> 07:20.166
(STRAINING) Your robot arm is waterproof.
How handy! Pun intended.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.916
You know all I have to do
is squeeze, right?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.458
Okay, okay. Easy, killer.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.916
How about we skip the shower
and grab the body spray?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
No!

07:30.583 --> 07:31.583
PETER: Okay, step three.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.208
Always aim for the head.
That's the only way to kill 'em.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.500
OKOYE: Will you turn that off?

07:35.583 --> 07:37.958
Oh. I was just showing Dr. Banner
the orientation video.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.916
General Okoye of the Dora Milaje.
Wakandan Royal Guard.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.083
You certainly picked a hell of a time
to visit the States, General.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.083
I swore an oath, Dr. Banner.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.833
My king went missing
with the Avengers weeks ago.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.416
And for the first time since the outbreak,
we actually have a reason to hope.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.875
A beacon just came in over the wires.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.541
Another survivor camp claims
to have made progress on a cure.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.458
Wh... Awesome! Global crisis solved.
High-fives all around, guys.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.541
Not quite.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.750
The beacon's location
was corrupted in transit.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.166
We have no idea where it came from.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.333
Well, it looks to me like your message
is in non-linear hexacode.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.250
That location look familiar, Agent Carter?

08:16.333 --> 08:19.750
It's Camp Lehigh in New Jersey.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first base of operations.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.041
It could have the equipment
you need to fabricate a cure.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.166
-Then we'll leave at sundown.
-(HAPPY SIGHS)

08:24.250 --> 08:26.916
Well, just when you thought
things couldn't get any worse,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.125
we gotta go to Jersey.

08:29.416 --> 08:32.041
Zombie-freakin'-apocalypse,
and somehow, I'm still driving.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.416
What is the problem?
I thought you were an Uber driver.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.125
No. I'm a personal chauffeur.
There's a difference.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.000
All right, everybody, it's Grand Central.

08:45.541 --> 08:49.250
Hope, Banner, Parker, track seven.
See if you can hot-wire the train.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.458
Sounds like job for criminal. I will help.

08:51.541 --> 08:52.666
Uh, splitting up?

08:52.750 --> 08:55.166
Do you guys just
not have horror movies in Wakanda?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.666
We don't need them.
We have American reality shows.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.625
Boom goes the dynamite.
That was solid burn on all of us.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.041
The rest of us will stay here
and guard the perimeter.

09:04.666 --> 09:06.500
KURT: No juice. We're getting no juice.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.250
Train, please be working for Daddy.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.500
(GRUNTS) It's not working.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.083
We're locked outta the gear box.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.666
I'm on it. I can jump-start the engine
from the inside.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.958
Spark ignition's not firing.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.291
<i>We need someone to give us a push.</i>

09:25.375 --> 09:27.250
Perhaps you summon your inner green demon.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.125
No. He's on sabbatical. Any other ideas?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.458
THE WASP: <i>Not unless someone happens</i>
<i>to have a giant slingshot.</i>

09:31.541 --> 09:32.791
-I've got an idea!
-(BOTH YELP)

09:32.875 --> 09:34.291
Make sure the brake lock is engaged.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.541
Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam, blam! Blam!

09:47.416 --> 09:49.083
(CHUCKLES) Just, uh, birds.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.000
-Were you saying "blam"?
-Was I?

09:52.958 --> 09:54.458
Ow. (GRUNTS)

09:54.541 --> 09:55.541
Happy?

09:57.708 --> 10:00.333
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam! Blam! Blam!

10:02.916 --> 10:03.916
Happy!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.333
<i>Man down, man down. We lost Happy!</i>

10:06.416 --> 10:09.875
What? No! (SIGHS) No, not Happy.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.000
I think it was... (GRUNTS)

10:15.208 --> 10:16.208
It's Hawkeye.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.333
(GROWLING) Blam. Blam. Blam.

10:33.416 --> 10:34.416
Blam.

10:55.541 --> 10:56.875
Bla...

10:56.958 --> 10:58.125
Sorry, Happy.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.541
Blam.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.666
That was your friend. Sorry about that.

11:16.416 --> 11:19.083
-I should be sad, but I'm not.
-Let's go.

11:30.458 --> 11:33.625
Okay, come on, guys! I think I have
about 4,000 pounds of thrust here.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.291
Hang in there, Peter. They're almost here.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.791
Okay, get ready to disengage
the brake on my mark.

11:43.583 --> 11:44.750
Heck yeah, Cape!

11:44.875 --> 11:48.041
(GASPS) No! No, no, bad zombie!
Bad zombie! Bad zombie!

11:51.708 --> 11:54.250
You are remarkable woman!

11:57.458 --> 11:59.333
The front of the train's all hooked up!

11:59.416 --> 12:00.833
Copy that. Inbound.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.250
We're all here! Go!

12:22.916 --> 12:25.500
We did it. Destination, Camp Lehigh.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.458
It's a good look on you.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.958
Really? You think I could pull it off?

12:35.041 --> 12:37.041
Maybe you'll grow into it.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.541
I'm sorry. We should have stayed together.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.833
Sharon? Sharon!

13:12.750 --> 13:14.625
I think you've had enough, Cap.

13:45.416 --> 13:46.416
THE WASP: Bucky!

13:58.708 --> 14:01.791
Sorry, pal.
I guess this is the end of the line.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.791
Uh, guys, I'm covered in Sharon.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.541
The kid has hand sanitizer.

14:18.541 --> 14:19.583
Uh, Hope?

14:19.666 --> 14:21.333
I think you're in trouble.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.958
Heart rate's elevated,

14:30.041 --> 14:33.333
temperature's not going
in the right direction.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.500
Then we both know what you have to do.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.583
No. Not when we could be
minutes away from a cure.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.541
(GRUNTS) Can we really take that risk?

14:40.625 --> 14:43.291
It's not risk. It's hope.

14:43.375 --> 14:46.958
And anyone who's seen a zombie movie
knows that that's the key to survival.

14:47.041 --> 14:50.666
Plus, it's also your name,
and that's gotta mean something.

14:51.666 --> 14:54.125
Oh, kid. How do you do it?

14:54.666 --> 14:56.875
See all these movies? AV club.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.416
(CHUCKLING) No. No, how do you stay so...

15:00.583 --> 15:01.666
...upbeat?

15:02.875 --> 15:04.333
After everything.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.458
Practice, I guess.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.291
My mom, dad, Uncle Ben, Mr. Stark.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.083
Now Happy.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.333
I've... I've lost a lot.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.416
But my Aunt May says...

15:20.416 --> 15:24.208
used to say, that if we don't keep smiling
when they can't,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.708
then we might as well just be gone, too.
And...

15:29.916 --> 15:31.416
Well, they'd want us to keep going.

15:37.666 --> 15:39.916
Guys, uh, bad news, team.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.416
The train has run out of fuel.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.250
How far away are we from Camp Lehigh?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.791
On the bright side,
we are at least closer than we were.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.625
(GROANS) And the not-bright side?

15:47.708 --> 15:50.458
We're going to have to walk through that.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.916
Well, looks like our draft cards
just got pulled.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.458
We will not make it through them.

16:01.541 --> 16:03.833
But you can make it over them.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.625
No, no. Hope, no.

16:05.708 --> 16:09.458
Listen to me.
We all know my time's up, okay?

16:09.541 --> 16:13.791
And if I have to go, I might as well
go out fixing the mess I started.

16:13.875 --> 16:16.625
Oh, come on, Hope. It's not your fault.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.416
I was so obsessed
with bringing my mom back

16:19.500 --> 16:22.375
that I never considered
what I might bring back with her.

16:23.291 --> 16:26.625
I started this,
but you are gonna finish it.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.166
Peter.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.250
Smile. Smile for me, okay?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.375
Uh, guys, why aren't they
climbing the fence?

17:51.416 --> 17:53.333
SPIDER-MAN: Uh, they don't
have to scale anything.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.958
We must be careful. Baba Yaga nears.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.125
-I can feel her.
-Baba who, now?

18:00.208 --> 18:03.041
Baba Yaga. The witch.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.458
Known to lurk in shadows
of sacred burial grounds.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.125
-Baba Ya...
-Oh, no, I totally just jump-scared you.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.458
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.666
It's just spider boy. Come on.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.750
-(BOTH YELP)
-Baba Ya...

18:15.625 --> 18:17.416
Oh, Vision! You're a vision!

18:17.500 --> 18:19.833
You have no idea how good it is
to see a familiar

18:19.916 --> 18:21.916
and not one of those gross,
half-eaten faces.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.291
One of the benefits of being an android.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.083
I'm not on the menu.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.416
Oh, that's it.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.291
That's how you've been able
to keep the zombies at bay.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.958
VISION: The Mind Stone.
The source of... well, me.

18:34.041 --> 18:37.125
It emits a sub-frequency
that is not to their liking.

18:37.208 --> 18:40.041
Could that mean the infection
is some kind of encephalopathy?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.166
-Brain stuff.
-VISION: Precisely.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.666
The virus overloads
the brain's limbic system.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.958
So once I discovered the infecteds'
aversion to the Mind Stone,

18:48.041 --> 18:51.875
I experimented to see if targeted exposure
might reverse their condition.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.041
Were you successful?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.000
SCOTT: Ta-da! See for yourself.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.416
-Wait, who said that?
-Was a ghost?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.916
SCOTT: Oh, damn.
Hey, would somebody turn me around?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.208
We messed up my entrance.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.000
You know,
I need to get this thing motorized.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.375
-Hey!
-Scott!

19:04.458 --> 19:06.291
-Scott.
-Lang?

19:06.375 --> 19:08.416
No... way.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.583
Oh, look at you.

19:09.666 --> 19:11.125
I know I've lost weight.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.208
Thank you for noticing.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.041
But don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.833
Sorry, I tend to process
traumatic events with dad jokes.

19:17.916 --> 19:19.166
Drives Hank crazy.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.833
Well, drove Hank crazy.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.250
Oh, man. Hank.

19:22.333 --> 19:26.791
Hey, <i>tulla, tulla.</i>
Don't cry. You'll fog up your jar.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.083
Sorry. I know, I know.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.375
It's just, what I wouldn't give
to get chewed out

19:30.458 --> 19:32.000
by that old grump one last time.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.916
Gah, I did it again! Zombie pun.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.541
Mmm. Well,
the operative point is I cured him.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.250
Which means you can cure others.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.333
Theoretically, but...

19:39.416 --> 19:41.291
We'll need access to a satellite network

19:41.375 --> 19:43.958
to broadcast
the Mind Stone frequency worldwide.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.541
Well, again, theoretically,

19:45.625 --> 19:49.500
but the technology required to do so
is currently beyond human capability.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.875
Not in Wakanda.
And thanks to our force shields,

19:51.958 --> 19:54.500
it remains the last human sanctuary
on Earth.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.750
I'll canvas the base,
see if I can find us transport.

19:57.833 --> 20:02.541
Sergeant Barnes, you will not find
what you're looking for.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.041
Uh, according to these security logs,

20:17.125 --> 20:19.375
we're not the first to respond
to Vision's signal.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.833
More survivors! Well, then where are they?

20:34.708 --> 20:36.750
T'CHALLA: Stop. You will anger her.

20:37.916 --> 20:38.916
T'Challa?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Bucky.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.250
Is it really you?

20:43.333 --> 20:44.583
Who did this to you?

20:44.666 --> 20:48.208
We don't have much time.
We have to run. Now.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.833
VISION: I'm sorry, Dr. Banner.

20:55.916 --> 20:58.208
I really do wish you hadn't found us.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.250
Vision, what the hell is this place?

21:00.333 --> 21:01.583
T'CHALLA: A trap.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.333
Oh, we feared you were dead!

21:05.416 --> 21:08.041
The Vision grabbed me in San Francisco.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.750
Thought he was saving me.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.041
He was just picking up takeout.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.875
He's been keeping him alive
to feed his zombie bride.

21:14.958 --> 21:17.416
That goth chick. I knew it!
I was pickin' up vibes.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.250
Her name is Wanda.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.416
And while your anger is predictable,

21:21.500 --> 21:24.041
I can assure you my actions,
though unsavory,

21:24.125 --> 21:26.416
were nevertheless born of logic.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.208
Well, in Vision's defense...
(CLICKS TONGUE) I've got nothing.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.333
Okay, wait, I don't get it.
You cured the talking head but not her?

21:32.416 --> 21:35.625
Her powers are too strong.
They've resisted the treatment.

21:35.708 --> 21:39.125
The only course of action is
to contain her and her hunger.

21:39.208 --> 21:40.458
Why not eliminate her?

21:41.416 --> 21:45.041
I... I couldn't.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.583
You lured innocent people to their deaths,

21:48.666 --> 21:50.458
all in the name of love?

21:50.541 --> 21:52.250
(SCOFFS) Love. Sucks.

21:52.750 --> 21:56.583
I still cannot entirely fathom
what I have done.

21:56.666 --> 21:59.375
So you should have no problem
submitting to human justice!

22:01.458 --> 22:03.708
You have awakened her.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.958
She hasn't eaten in days.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.875
Baba Yaga! (YELLS)

22:22.083 --> 22:24.000
Whoa! Watch out! She's a man-eater!

22:24.083 --> 22:25.541
There it is, I'm doing it again.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.000
(GRUNTS) Whoa!

22:35.708 --> 22:37.416
Ah, thanks. I feel like I'm back at prom.

22:40.416 --> 22:43.208
Vision, we need your help.
Get us out of here.

22:48.416 --> 22:50.541
Yes, Doctor, I believe you are right.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.458
<i>Wingardium leviosa!</i>

22:59.291 --> 23:00.291
Okoye.

23:02.791 --> 23:03.833
Okoye!

23:03.916 --> 23:06.708
My king. Wakanda forever. (GASPS)

23:15.083 --> 23:18.041
We haven't much time.
There's a Quadjet in the hangar.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.208
You're not coming?

23:19.291 --> 23:21.875
I must atone for what I have done.

23:22.916 --> 23:25.666
But I cannot bring myself to leave her.

23:57.541 --> 23:58.833
Bucky!

23:59.583 --> 24:00.625
Run.

24:40.916 --> 24:42.958
Oh, nice save, big guy.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.250
Do you think you can fly this?

24:48.333 --> 24:49.500
Uh, if it ever boots up.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.958
Uh, guys, impending doom on our six.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.791
Uh, that's our 12. But yes,
what the head said. Doom, total doom.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.250
I can buy you guys some time...

24:56.333 --> 24:58.291
Dr. Banner, no, we are not leaving you.

24:58.375 --> 25:02.000
I just... I... I really, I don't think
I can lose another friend today.

25:03.125 --> 25:05.291
So... avenge us.

25:07.958 --> 25:09.000
Yeah.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.625
Okay, big guy. Kinda counting on you here.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.916
Things are pretty bad.
It'd be nice for you to be the hero.

25:20.458 --> 25:25.791
I mean, wouldn't it be kinda cool
for you to be the nice one for a change?

25:28.583 --> 25:29.958
Oh, yes!

25:31.500 --> 25:32.833
Oh, no, no, no, no.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.958
We did it! We really did it!

25:59.041 --> 26:02.041
No, don't jinx it! (GROANS)
Doesn't anybody here watch horror movies?

26:05.250 --> 26:06.666
Hope? Hope!

26:08.291 --> 26:09.291
Oh! Hope!

26:12.125 --> 26:13.250
Firing thrusters.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.166
I'm sorry.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.750
She gave her life
so we could get the cure.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.416
That's twice she saved me.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.875
That's... very Hope.

26:48.958 --> 26:51.000
ETA, 20 minutes.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.916
Well, put another "W"
on the board for the Avengers.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.208
Go ahead, high-five.
It's okay, I won't feel left out.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.083
You all right?

27:00.583 --> 27:03.708
(SIGHS) Last year,
Mr. Stark asked me to join the Avengers.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.083
I turned him down,
and now they're all gone.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.750
And I'm still here.

27:08.833 --> 27:12.458
In my culture, death is not the end.

27:12.541 --> 27:16.750
They are still with us,
as long as we do not forget them.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.833
Plus, they're not all gone.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.708
-Me. You still have me.
-PETER: Oh.

27:22.458 --> 27:25.125
I'm so sor... I-I forgot.
You are an Avenger.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.500
Totally. Big time.

27:26.583 --> 27:29.291
Well, maybe not officially.
But, you know, at heart.

27:29.375 --> 27:32.125
Good. The world could use
a little heart right now.

27:32.208 --> 27:35.583
And once we get this to Wakanda,
we're gonna save the world.

27:37.125 --> 27:41.750
THE WATCHER: <i>Even in the darkest of times,</i>
<i>humans will give all to save their planet.</i>

27:44.416 --> 27:48.000
<i>Even if it might bring an end</i>
<i>to the universe.</i>
