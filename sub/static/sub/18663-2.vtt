00:08.760 --> 00:12.117
FRED: I provided a ship for an
OPA recon mission out of Ceres,

00:12.240 --> 00:13.356
which disappeared.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.955

retrieve the lone survivor.</i>

(DOOR SMASHES)

00:17.440 --> 00:18.430
Julie.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.320
DRESDEN: <i>I'm truly sorry to be
the one to have to tell you this,</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:22.954
<i>but your daughter is dead.</i>

00:23.160 --> 00:26.119
<i>We can only learn
by letting it learn.</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:27.839
You'll be landing
on Phoebe Station.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.639
After Phoebe went silent,

00:29.720 --> 00:31.279
the <i>Donnager</i> was sent
to investigate.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.840
MAN: (ON SCREEN)
<i>Every one of the bodies</i>

00:32.920 --> 00:34.274
<i>looked like
they were incinerated</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:35.350
SADAVIR:
<i>There's been a development.</i>

00:35.520 --> 00:37.716
The Martians dispatched
a ship to Phoebe Station,

00:37.800 --> 00:39.359
I know.
What are you doing about it?

00:39.440 --> 00:43.673
The wise thing to do right now is to
target the <i>MCRN</i> fleet. System-wide.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.630
MAN: <i>The Martians
were targeting</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:46.870
<i>Phoebe Research Station,</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:49.156
<i>which sustained
multiple direct hits.</i>

00:49.240 --> 00:50.754
<i>The ice moon fractured
under the barrage,</i>

00:50.840 --> 00:51.990
<i>and it's completely gone.</i>

00:52.080 --> 00:54.959
There's a shadow government
working within the UN,

00:55.080 --> 00:57.549
orchestrating
a system-wide war

00:57.640 --> 00:58.960
between Earth and Mars.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.560
(SIGHS) What do you want?

01:00.720 --> 01:01.790
I need a spy.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.876
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:06.360 --> 02:08.079
The <i>Nathan Hale</i>
was going to reach Phoebe

02:08.160 --> 02:09.229
ahead of the <i>Scirocco.</i>

02:09.320 --> 02:11.198
Mars clearly wasn't willing
to let that happen.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.920
What was on Phoebe that Mars
didn't want us to find?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.116
We'll never know
now, will we?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.395
Sir, we precipitated this

02:16.480 --> 02:19.075
by sending a ship to Phoebe
in the first place.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.914
They weren't firing
on the <i>Hale.</i>

02:22.000 --> 02:24.913
They intended to miss.
A first shot across the bow.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.470
Thank heaven Captain Yvgeny
has a cool head

02:27.560 --> 02:30.359
or we'd be already glassing
each other's cities.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.155
Mars destroyed an abandoned
and expendable base.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.038
A warning for us to stop
shadowing their vessels.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.840
Phoebe Station was a joint
facility run by an Earth corp.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.316
The only intel saying it was
abandoned came from Mars.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.915
And now two-thirds of their
fleet is heading for Earth.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.480
You think that's just
a training exercise?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.750
They're burning sunward,
that doesn't mean

02:45.840 --> 02:47.160
they're getting ready
for an invasion.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.038
Admiral Nguyen's point
is well taken.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.952
We must make
a strong response.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.196
SOUTHER: Then let's speak
in a language

02:52.280 --> 02:53.555
that Mars understands.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.359
Their helium
and titanium supply lines,

02:55.440 --> 02:56.430
which we help defend,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.512
are vital to
their terraforming efforts.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.829
If we threaten
to shut them down...

02:59.920 --> 03:00.956
NGUYEN:
A trade embargo?

03:01.040 --> 03:02.235
No, what we need to do
is order

03:02.320 --> 03:04.152
the <i>Nathan Hale</i> to take out
the <i>Scirocco</i> now...

03:04.240 --> 03:05.799
SOUTHER: If we go this way,
we're going to be watching

03:05.880 --> 03:06.836
each other's ships fall
from the skies...

03:06.920 --> 03:08.070
Sir, if I may.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.351
The Deep Radar Station
on Deimos.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.035
It's mostly automated,
minimal personnel,

03:15.120 --> 03:16.520
casualties will be light.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.796
You want us to attack
a Martian moon?

03:19.320 --> 03:20.879
That's a declaration of war.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.600
No, it's a warning.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.031
It's a goddamn serious one,
but that's the point.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.634
It shows that we're willing
to strike at the heart

03:26.720 --> 03:27.710
of their territory.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.632
Degrade their command
and control at the same time.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.710
I like it.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.280
A base for a base.
I don't know

03:32.360 --> 03:34.192
how we can get much more
proportional than that.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.717
I'd need a resolution from
the Security Council first.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.757
We'll call for a vote immediately.
They'll back you.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.480
Sharing the blame does
not change what this is.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.638
Fleet Command will not...

03:47.800 --> 03:50.076
I will not support
this escalation.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.472
Are you saying you won't carry
out a lawfully given order?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.239
If that's the case, Admiral,
I'm afraid

04:00.320 --> 04:03.040
- I'm gonna have to ask...
- No need to pretend this is a request, sir.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.680
You're damn right,
it will.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.558
Shall I meet them
on the dock with guns?

We'll start
with conversation.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.994
Now what story is that?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.160
Maybe it's the one about
why the rock I sent you to

05:11.240 --> 05:13.436
exploded into
a nuclear fireball?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.876
Or what happened
to the OPA operative

05:16.000 --> 05:17.753
I tasked you to find?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.994
Or, maybe it's the story

05:21.080 --> 05:23.595
of where the hell you've been
since then,

05:23.680 --> 05:26.798
without one goddamn word
of communication back to me.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.952
We were on Eros.
We barely got out alive.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.152
And the only reason
we're here now

05:32.240 --> 05:34.391
is to see if you want to do
something about it.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.274
We're wasting our time here.
Let's get out of here.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.357
This guy's no soldier,
he's too busy countin' bolts.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.715
Who the hell
is this asshole?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.269
I'm the asshole
who found your operative.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.829
Her name was
Juliette Andromeda Mao.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.956
In case you're interested,

05:48.040 --> 05:50.999
she died, alone, on Eros,
waiting for you

05:51.120 --> 05:53.555
OPA chair-jockeys
to come help her.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.793
What happened
on that station?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.116
It wasn't
a biohazard emergency.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.953
Someone was
testing a weapon.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.874
MILLER: Julie uncovered a plan
to unleash this thing on Eros.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.917
She tried to stop it,
she got infected.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.720
It was something new.
A life-form.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.710
Possibly extra-solar
in origin.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.873
An alien life form?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.835
According to the <i>gymonk</i>
who discovered it on Phoebe.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.560
HOLDEN: Whoever
unleashed it on Eros

06:20.640 --> 06:23.314
dosed everyone with radiation
to spread it faster.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.995
They set up cameras
and sensors, in advance.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.800
MILLER: Eros is an
experiment on Belters.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.236
Everybody down there is dead,
they're dying,

06:31.320 --> 06:33.915
they're being studied,
like bugs under a microscope.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.639
And they're beaming
the data here.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.031
It's an abandoned
communications relay.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.355
HOLDEN:
At least some of the people

06:39.440 --> 06:41.557
responsible for Eros
are gonna be there.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.550
If we want answers,
we have to take that station.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.599
It's floating dark,
barely registers on radar

06:48.800 --> 06:51.474
but it's got a habitat ring,
which means someone's home.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.359
The first thing
we have to get past is this.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.511
FRED: Mmm-mmm.
That's a stealth ship.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.319
Like the ones they used
to kill the <i>Donnager.</i>

06:58.400 --> 07:00.119
We have a gunship of our own.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.840
Slugging it out with a stealth
is not gonna get it done.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.513
If you want
to take that station,

07:04.600 --> 07:06.478
you need to land
an assault team.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.438
Do you have any idea
of the resistance inside?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.557
No, we don't. That's why
we're talking to you.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.154
You're the military genius.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.837
Well, I don't do
that kind of thing anymore.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.952
And the OPA is not an army...

07:18.080 --> 07:19.594
We're going,
with or without you.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.831
And if you'd seen
what's happening on Eros,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.235
you'd be right there
with us.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.713
Julie died for the Belt.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.876
She believed everything you
guys say you're fighting for.

Don't waste it.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.434
at either one of those,

are gonna be

else, so don't be shy.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.913

a job, if that's what...

08:11.000 --> 08:12.480
I don't wanna bunk,
or a job.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.240
we should check in on them
once they get settled.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.390
You do that.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.670
They're rock hoppers, right?

08:23.760 --> 08:24.989
They don't have the skills
for this place.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.719
Be a shame if they get stuck
in group housing,

08:26.800 --> 08:28.632
with some shitty job, right?

08:28.720 --> 08:30.916
Yeah,
that'd be a real shame.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.236
You know the only reason
they infected Eros

is because it's got
the poorest Belters

08:36.640 --> 08:37.835
in the system, right?

08:37.919 --> 08:39.274
The ones no one
gives a shit about...

08:39.360 --> 08:40.919
Are you trying to make
yourself feel bad about this?

08:41.760 --> 08:44.195
I'm gonna feel better when
I watch those assholes burn.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.192
Look, I'm for killing
whoever needs killing.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.959
But it's not gonna
make you feel better.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.191
The ones we saved,
we only saved by accident.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.270
We should have saved more.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.350
We saved us.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.189
Crew comes first. If we'd
have went back for strays,

08:56.280 --> 08:57.270
we'd end up dead,
like them.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.430
We should've at least tried.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.111
We could've filled the <i>Roci</i>
with people, but we didn't.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.713
What the hell does that say
about us, huh?

09:06.840 --> 09:10.197
You can talk
all day long about,

you know,

09:12.120 --> 09:15.318
Minding your own business,
just trying to survive.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.234
It all boils down
to an excuse,

09:17.320 --> 09:19.152
and that excuse ain't worth
a good goddamn

09:19.240 --> 09:21.152
when the world is
burning down around you.

as doing the wrong thing.

are we,

10:22.720 --> 10:24.871
I'm talking about
all of you.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.429
Being caught up in this...

10:26.560 --> 10:27.960
Alex wants to do something.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.715
Amos doesn't do anything
he doesn't want to.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.996
And if you think I'm going
along just because of you...

10:33.080 --> 10:35.276
You never wanted to be on the
same team as Fred Johnson,

10:35.360 --> 10:37.829
or be tangled up
with the OPA again.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.836
I ran with some
bad people once.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.079
Stupid kids with OPA tatts
and big ideas.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.152
I got involved
in some things,

10:51.760 --> 10:53.672
and innocent people died.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.434
So I said never again.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.239
But this time
it's different.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.029
After Eros?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.596
Are you scared?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.434
I'm angry.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.436
HOLDEN: So...

11:21.800 --> 11:23.757
Do you think the others
have a sense

11:23.840 --> 11:25.479
about what's
going on with us?

11:25.760 --> 11:28.116
I mean, Amos,
in particular?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.439
We can make
a public announcement,

11:30.520 --> 11:33.115
get everyone on the same page.
Or take out an ad.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.511
No, it's just...
I was never clear about how you two...

11:36.600 --> 11:37.875
You know.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.838
Well, I asked if you were
a couple once.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.156
What did he say?

11:42.760 --> 11:43.876
He said he'd be okay

11:43.960 --> 11:45.872
throwing me into space
without my helmet,

11:45.960 --> 11:47.360
but that you
wouldn't like it.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.636
Sounds like Amos,
16-millimeter.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.994
It's kind of hard to explain.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.755
He's like a brother.
We look out for each other.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.440
You sure
he's clear on that?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.355
Pretty sure.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.030
You did hear the part about
him throwing me off the ship

12:05.160 --> 12:06.150
without my helmet, right?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.390
- I did.
- HOLDEN: Great.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.716
'Cause I'm really liking us

12:08.800 --> 12:10.632
not threatening
to kill each other anymore.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.719
You threatened to kill him?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.195
Just the one time.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.999
Let's try to behave.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.830
And if we can't behave,
we'll tread lightly.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.156
We have bigger things
to worry about anyway.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.554
FRED: All I can
tell you is that

12:26.680 --> 12:28.239
we're assaulting a station

12:28.320 --> 12:30.755
and are expecting
heavy resistance.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.435
I need 50 people
with combat experience.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.398
They'll get top hazard pay

12:35.480 --> 12:38.120
and first dibs on
the new equipment contracts.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.032
My people have those
contracts for three years...

12:40.120 --> 12:42.760
And it time someone else
get a go at the tit.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.593
We will honor those
existing contracts.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.677
But we'll be adding 30 more
positions to the <i>Nauvoo.</i>

12:49.440 --> 12:51.113
The rest will come
from other bids,

12:51.200 --> 12:52.190
all new work.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.875
Yeah, go on, <i>coyo.</i>

12:55.000 --> 12:56.878
Keep licking
the Earther's hand,

12:56.960 --> 13:00.351
maybe he toss you a few more
scrap from his table.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.359
It's not news to me
that Black Sky

13:02.440 --> 13:03.840
resents my position here.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.599
But trust me,

13:05.720 --> 13:08.872
now is not the time
for factions or debate.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.749
There's OPA

13:11.120 --> 13:12.759
and there is OPA.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.030
You?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.755
You're just an Earther
playing Belter.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.877
We don't need you
giving us orders,

13:18.960 --> 13:21.475
and we don't need you
picking our target.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.194
Me and mine, we just hack
a UN drone on Earth.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.877
Came this close to wasting
that <i>wupo</i> Avasarala.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.794
That is how you get
the Inners' attention.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.232
And how do you suppose
that's gonna play out?

13:38.480 --> 13:39.994
Don't know yet.

13:40.480 --> 13:45.111
But we've got cells on Ceres,
on Pallas, Hygea.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.317
When we hit the Inners
100 more time,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.959
we gonna find out.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.799
(CROWD MURMURING
IN AGREEMENT)

13:50.880 --> 13:53.076
Well, I'm sorry
I wasted your time.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.391
(CHUCKLES) You not
wasting my time, Earther.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.757
You're the one
who don't belong here.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.158
Maybe it's time real Belter

14:02.520 --> 14:04.512
took what should be ours.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.677
Like Anderson Dawes
on Ceres.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.600
Maybe now...

14:09.640 --> 14:12.599
Maybe now is our time.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.279
(BOTH GRUNTING)

14:21.360 --> 14:22.350
(YELLS)

14:34.760 --> 14:38.390
What happened on Eros
wasn't a plague.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.470
It was a genocide on Belters,

14:42.560 --> 14:44.791
done by those
who think we're weak.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.109
Divided.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.871
A thousand different tribes
scattered across the Belt,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.517
who could never unite
and fight back.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.670
Well, we're going after
those who killed Eros.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.351
Tell that to your factions.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.516
I need 50 good fighters.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.394
Send your best.

ALEX: That son of a bitch.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.514
Goddamn!

15:31.600 --> 15:33.034
FRED: <i>Don't beat yourself up.</i>

15:33.160 --> 15:34.560
That's your best run yet.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.314
ALEX:
<i>It's that goddamn rail gun.</i>

15:36.520 --> 15:38.239
Soon as that stealth
points its nose at us,

15:38.320 --> 15:39.436
we're done like dinner.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.716
All right, listen.
Don't lose the big picture.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.439
Our cargo freighter disguise

15:43.520 --> 15:45.159
is only gonna fool them
for so long.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.675
The breaching pods
are defenseless.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.395
<i>You have to flush out
and engage that stealth ship</i>

15:50.480 --> 15:52.790
<i>or the pods will never
make it to the station.</i>

15:56.800 --> 15:59.269

keeps getting killed.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.230
If we start further away,
they nail us with torpedoes.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.630
Get too close,
it's that rail gun.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.518
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

16:06.880 --> 16:07.870
It sounds to me like

16:07.960 --> 16:10.191
you're just picking
which kind of dead, pal.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.872
Well, Alex
is playing alone right now.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.878
We get a full crew,
it'll be different.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.556
Yeah, a crack team of space commandos,
you guys.

if I ask you sit this one out.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.511
Close quarters battle
can get kinda hairy.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.473
What the hell use
would I ever be on a ship?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.035
Nah,

16:36.560 --> 16:38.392
I'm going down
with the assault team.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.952
Have you seen
the breaching pod?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.952
It's a beer can
taped to a rocket.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.235
You're not gonna like
the ride.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.120
Fred's trying to land
50 pissed off Belters

16:48.200 --> 16:50.920
and seven different OPA

from shooting each other.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.791
Oh, I ain't sitting
this one out.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.554
All right, then.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.479
I'll go clean out my cabin.

(GROANS)

17:08.599 --> 17:09.715
Leave it.

I'll have...

17:36.360 --> 17:37.350
Gin and tonic with a lime.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.715
You're not as invisible
as you think you are.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.314
I'm not on a covert op.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.513
I would've pegged you
as a Scotch drinker...

17:42.600 --> 17:43.590
I don't drink often.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.512
You're entitled
to celebrate.

Good command.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.030
And Nguyen gets my old job.
Much obliged.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.713
Deimos was the smallest move

17:56.800 --> 17:58.393
the Secretary General
could swallow.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.076
Big symbol,
minimal body count.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.153
Anyone with half a brain knew
we were not going to leave

18:04.240 --> 18:06.072

without an escalation.

I'm honored you think

18:07.240 --> 18:08.833
you gotta justify

I'm simply telling you how

18:10.320 --> 18:12.357

got you sidelined.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.557
And how does that help

Well, when your war
breaks out,

sit your ass down, yes.

grow a pair

18:37.000 --> 18:38.514
and tell me
what you really think.

We're just two people
having a drink. No ranks.

with life and death

18:49.640 --> 18:51.472

and a poison tongue

18:55.040 --> 18:56.713

is in tatters

and Errinwright.

to the contrary,

19:02.400 --> 19:03.914
you, Madam Undersecretary,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.640
may be the worst person
I have ever met.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.399
Feel good getting that
out of your system?

19:18.520 --> 19:20.113
That was the plan,
wasn't it?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.040
Yeah, it did.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.039
Now, why don't you grow a pair
and tell me why you're here.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.640
Tell me about Fred Johnson.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.074
When he joined the OPA

19:30.160 --> 19:31.913
and everyone lined up
to stone him,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.036
you stayed quiet. Why?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.520
There was plenty said
about him.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.831
I understand it's hard
to watch a war hero...

19:36.920 --> 19:38.752
You don't understand shit
about Fred Johnson.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.792
- Enlighten me.
- Oh, then you want the real story?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.280
Yes, I would.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.674
I got this from someone who
was there, someone I trust.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.831
Your predecessors
in the previous administration

19:52.960 --> 19:54.030
buried it.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.589
The Belters who seized control
of Anderson Station

19:57.680 --> 19:59.911
had been trying to
negotiate for days.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.390
UNN Command
was jamming their comms,

20:02.600 --> 20:04.432
but when the Belters
finally gave up,

20:06.280 --> 20:09.034
Colonel Johnson wasn't told
that they'd surrendered.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.115
If he knew,
he would have never called that strike in.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.680
Why wasn't he told?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.030
Because the powers that be

20:16.120 --> 20:18.510
wanted to send a message
to the Belt.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.832
"Defy us, we wipe you out."
Message sent.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.355
And Fred Johnson
switched sides, why?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.159
As a revenge against Earth?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.359
The UN pinned
a medal on his chest

20:28.440 --> 20:29.635
for Anderson Station.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.959
He was a hero to Earth
and despised everywhere else.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.474
All based on a lie.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.871
But you know what?
He never said a word.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.599
Didn't even try
to clear his name.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.749
Just walked away.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.879
So does that make him
a hero or a traitor?

20:46.360 --> 20:48.511
(SIGHS) I don't know
what it makes him.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.240
But I know that he's
an honorable man

20:51.320 --> 20:52.549
who held onto his soul,

20:52.640 --> 20:55.155
and that is a tough thing
to do in this line of work.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.036
Not bad.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.353
But I prefer beer.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.795
She's buying.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.472
Didn't think
he had that in him.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.995
I need you to do
something for me.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.118
I'm sure
I'm going to love it.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.716
I need to send a communiquÃ©,
off everybody's radar.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.474
No traces back to me.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.072

38:15.640 --> 38:16.630
You.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.516
Have we met?

38:21.640 --> 38:22.676
(GROANS)

38:24.400 --> 38:25.390
(EXHALES)

38:25.880 --> 38:27.439
Up. Get up.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.478
- Miller, stand down.
- Oh, good.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.950
This station
is now under OPA control.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.673
What would it take
to make you guys go away,

38:33.760 --> 38:34.796
Colonel Johnson?

38:35.040 --> 38:37.714
Weapons? Money?
Political favors?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.075
My benefactors are powerful...

38:39.160 --> 38:40.594
Get his ass out of here.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.355
Let's go.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.515
Idiots.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.153
Every scrap of data
in this facility

38:51.240 --> 38:52.276
has been encrypted.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.079
We know what you were doing
on Eros.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.879
Nobody knows
what we're doing on Eros.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.679
And every minute I have to
spend playing games with you,

38:57.760 --> 38:59.194
takes me away from that work.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.839
You're in an excellent
bargaining position.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.274
Tell me what you want
and we'll negotiate.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.073
You're going to help us
make a vaccine.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.355
No. That goes against

39:05.440 --> 39:06.669
everything we're trying
to accomplish.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.956
You infected
a station full of Belters...

39:09.040 --> 39:11.236
They were infected
to save us all.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.390
You're gonna have to be

39:16.480 --> 39:18.517
a hell of a lot
more specific than that.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.316
We made a discovery on Phoebe.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.153
HOLDEN:
An extra-solar life-form.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.353
We found your lab notes
on the <i>Anubis.</i>

39:25.440 --> 39:27.318
Maybe you can appreciate
what it is.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.991
An organism that can repurpose
other life-forms

39:31.080 --> 39:32.912
and use them to evolve.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.275
Into what?

39:34.360 --> 39:35.840
That's what
we're trying to find out.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.832
In a controlled,
isolated environment

39:37.920 --> 39:39.957
that can be sterilized
if it gets out of hand.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.271
You could've fed it
a vat of bacteria.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.390
(GROANS)

39:43.480 --> 39:47.360
I'm not interested in
the cosmic fate of bacteria.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.557
The protomolecule is proof

39:49.640 --> 39:51.393
that we're not alone
in the universe.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.949
And our ticket out of
the limitations that bind us

39:54.040 --> 39:56.635
to these pathetic little
bubbles of rock and air.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.713
If we master it,
we can apply it.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.473
Apply it to what?

40:01.680 --> 40:03.751
To everything.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.038
We become our own gods.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.472
Imagine human beings able
to live in hard vacuum

40:09.560 --> 40:10.550
without a suit,

40:10.640 --> 40:13.439
or under the crushing
atmosphere of a gas giant.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.512
Or able to hibernate
long enough

40:15.640 --> 40:17.472
to travel to the stars.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.672
That's why you were willing
to start a war?

40:19.840 --> 40:21.035
(CHUCKLES)

40:21.120 --> 40:22.759
Have you heard
of Genghis Khan?

40:22.840 --> 40:25.514
He built one of the greatest
empires in human history.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.000
Killed or displaced a quarter

40:27.080 --> 40:30.073
of the entire population
on Earth during his conquests.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.720
Today, that's the equivalent
of 10 billion people.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.395
Eros is hardly a rounding
error by comparison.

40:35.480 --> 40:36.880
And that justifies
all of this?

40:36.960 --> 40:38.235
Of course it does!

40:38.320 --> 40:40.551
The protomolecule wasn't
sent here by accident.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.478
Earth was its target.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.636
It was sent to hijack life on
our planet for its own ends.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.719
You can't save Eros.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.077
All you can do now
is waste the data

40:51.160 --> 40:52.913
and ensure that every
man, woman and child

40:53.000 --> 40:54.753
on that rock died for nothing.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.115
The data will erase itself

40:56.200 --> 40:58.635
if anyone other than me
tries to decrypt it.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.994
Without this work,
humanity will be left unarmed,

41:03.400 --> 41:05.790
ignorant, vulnerable,

41:06.160 --> 41:09.198
to an enemy who's already
fired the first shot.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.879
I don't care
who controls the project.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.595
So long as I can get back
to my work,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.518
with no restrictions.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.918
So we have an understanding?

41:32.800 --> 41:35.474
We're going to need
complete access to the data.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.676
As well as the names

41:36.760 --> 41:40.037
of everyone responsible
for setting this in motion.

41:40.800 --> 41:41.916
Done.
