The people were
really into the music,

13:39.553 --> 13:42.086

14:59.799 --> 15:01.532
What... What was missing?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.534

-What the fuck did I do?
-Shh.

54:58.495 --> 55:00.429
But Marie,
she tried to fuck me!

55:00.431 --> 55:03.499
You said you didn't
have anything left.
You don't care about things.

55:03.501 --> 55:06.035
Let's go together,
and ride off into the sun.

55:06.037 --> 55:09.772
And... And I think that...
That we should take
your beautifulness

55:09.774 --> 55:12.274
-and my, uh,
life at the moment...
-Sit.

55:12.276 --> 55:14.910
I want to build
Dreamland with you.

55:16.012 --> 55:18.180
-Drink this.

55:18.715 --> 55:19.948

55:22.085 --> 55:24.520
-(SIGHS)
-What is going on?

55:24.654 --> 55:28.257
I... I just...
I want to be with you, okay?

55:28.259 --> 55:29.124
-We can't.
-I just...

55:29.126 --> 55:30.492
-We can't.
-I want to be with you.

55:30.494 --> 55:31.994
Sweetie, we talked about this.

55:31.996 --> 55:32.528
-You mean...
-Shh.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.963
(WHISPERING)
...everything to me,
but I don't want you to...

55:39.336 --> 55:40.936

55:42.506 --> 55:44.139
OLIVIA: I don't
know if you've met.

55:44.141 --> 55:47.042
This is my piano teacher,
Monty Fagan.

55:47.044 --> 55:48.911
Monty,
this is my husband, Allen.

55:48.913 --> 55:51.180
Hi, there.
Nice to meet you, Monty.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.816
It's so nice to meet you.
Yeah.

55:53.818 --> 55:55.984
Monty was in the neighborhood,
so he thought he'd stop by

55:55.986 --> 55:58.954
and get his check
from last week's lesson.

55:58.956 --> 56:01.023
We're having a drink.
Would you like one, honey?

56:01.025 --> 56:05.394
Oh, no. I'm tired.
You two enjoy, though.

56:06.129 --> 56:08.063
Nice to meet you, Monty.

56:08.398 --> 56:10.566
It's nice meeting you, too.

You know, a little nightcap
wouldn't hurt.

56:24.181 --> 56:27.583
OLIVIA: Well,
you deserve it, honey,
after all that traveling.

56:27.585 --> 56:30.686
Yeah, yeah. (CHUCKLES)

56:30.688 --> 56:34.656
You know,
I was thinking, uh...

56:35.024 --> 56:38.994
We need someone
to play the piano
at the, uh, ceremony.

56:38.996 --> 56:41.864
Monty. Monty, sit down,
relax. Geez.

56:41.866 --> 56:44.199
(STUTTERS) "Ceremony"?

56:44.201 --> 56:48.937
Yeah. Olivia and I
are renewing our vows, right?

56:48.939 --> 56:49.872
OLIVIA: Mmm-hmm.

56:49.874 --> 56:51.540
ALLEN: You know,
you look really great.

56:51.542 --> 56:52.374
Thank you, sweetie.

56:52.376 --> 56:54.643
Um, I'm not really sure
Monty's into
that sort of thing.

56:54.645 --> 56:56.612
ALLEN: Well, why...
Why the hell not?
He'll be perfect.

56:56.614 --> 57:00.215
Huh? Come on, come on.
We'll get you paid out
right now.

57:00.217 --> 57:03.318
Don't feel obligated, Monty.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.588
I'd love to.

57:06.890 --> 57:08.257
It's settled.

57:11.027 --> 57:13.929
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy. Easy there, kid.
How're you...

57:13.931 --> 57:16.298
You're gonna drive home
like that? Huh?

57:16.300 --> 57:18.901
(SLURRING) I drive a moped.

57:19.369 --> 57:20.135
A moped?

57:20.137 --> 57:22.137
-Moped, yeah.
-Where do you live?

57:22.139 --> 57:23.939
-Koreatown.
-Koreatown?

57:23.941 --> 57:28.110
(LAUGHS) Oh, God, that's...
That's very hip.
Yeah, Koreatown.

57:28.112 --> 57:32.848
Can't let you ride
all the way back there
like this, huh?

57:34.684 --> 57:37.519
Stay in the, uh...
Stay in the guest house.

57:37.521 --> 57:42.124
And since you're gonna stay,
another drink wouldn't hurt,
right?

57:42.126 --> 57:43.492
There you go.

Come on.

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:51.812
Joanna.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.382
Yeah.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:06.093
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.962
Sure.

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.565
I'm Monty, by the way.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.168
Yeah, I...
I signed you in.

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.703
Yes, you did.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:20.407
It's not a real service dog,
by the way, the dog that I...

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:22.676
-Oh, really? (SIGHS)
-No.

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:24.178
-Yeah.
-You got me.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.713
-(CHUCKLES)
-That's so dumb.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:27.214
-Well, not officially yet.
-Oh.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.551
Just filling out the papers,
all the red tape and...

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.152
So you're making it right?

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:32.887
-I am.
-Good.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:36.023
-Trying to.
-Cool, that's all I can ask.

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:39.660
-Cool.
-Cool.

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:46.200
So how long have you
been working here?

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:48.269
-Five months.
-Five months, wow.

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:49.470
-Two days.
-Two days?

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:51.205
-That's totally official.
-You're there.

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:55.009
I'm there. Maybe one day,
I'll be... Concierge.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.644
Wow, concierge.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.146
Maybe one day
I'll own a hotel.

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.383
Well, everybody
has a dream, right?

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:06.954
Tonight is
my first official night

01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:10.557
playing at this
beautiful hotel.

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:16.463
And you could join me
if you wanted to.
You could watch me.

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:20.634
And, on top of that,
Walter gave me
some drink tickets.

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:21.502
Actually,
they're not drink tickets.

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:25.039
They're just these coasters
that he initialed his name on.

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:26.273
Sure.

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:30.477
-All right, cool.
-Let me see them, though.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:32.313
-It's... Yeah.
-Seems good.

01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:35.316
-Yeah.
-Shall I redeem these?

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:39.453
MONTY: They're never gonna
let you in in that T-shirt,
just so you know.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:45.659
MONTY: <i>My deepest condolences</i>
<i>to the family and friends of</i>
<i>the late, great Fred Russo.</i>

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:49.229
<i>I'd like to honor him</i>
<i>with my own request.</i>

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:53.100
(PLAYING
<i>MEET ME TONIGHT IN DREAMLAND)</i>

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.346
