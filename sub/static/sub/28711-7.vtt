00:19.062 --> 00:20.759
[Lucilia]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.846 --> 00:23.458
Hello, Abby.
God, I am so relieved
that you are okay.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
-Don't.
-Oh, Abby, if this is about

00:25.242 --> 00:26.461
Maria attacking you
like that...

00:26.548 --> 00:28.289
You should be dead!

00:28.376 --> 00:29.768
[Avery]  I honestly don't know
what got into her.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.596
-I'm just sorry
I wasn't there--
-Stop.

00:31.683 --> 00:32.641
[Lucilia]  I took
a man's life
to protect you.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.253
Dubois,
he fuckin' saw you.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.950
You took out Holland's boat.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.604
What are you taking about?
You know me!

00:39.691 --> 00:41.171
And I know Avery Sunderland.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.564
Holland must've been
in his way,

00:42.651 --> 00:44.174
which means
he needed him gone.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.133
So he found somebody
he could trust,

00:46.220 --> 00:48.918
somebody he knew
would keep their
damn mouth shut.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.963
[Jason]  Daniel Cassidy
regained consciousness.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.489
[Avery]  And this happened
because you spun
a magic potion

00:54.576 --> 00:57.492
from the sample Abby took
out of the swamp.

00:57.579 --> 01:01.148
I'm giving you a discovery
that could change the world.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.237
[Swamp Thing]  A stranger
came to me in the swamp.

01:03.324 --> 01:07.415
He wants me to look
more deeply into this
green that surrounds me.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.286
-[Abby] What's that?
-[Swamp Thing] I'm not sure.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.811
Alec.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.335
Abby?

01:17.381 --> 01:18.469
[Abby] Hi.

01:19.775 --> 01:20.776
Hi.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.170
[inhales sharply]

01:26.782 --> 01:28.088
[exhales deeply]

01:30.002 --> 01:31.091
[chuckles]

01:34.485 --> 01:36.574
I just... [stutters]
I don't understand.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.882
How is any of this possible?

01:41.275 --> 01:42.972
I think the spore
you inhaled

01:43.059 --> 01:44.713
had some
hallucinogenic property
or something.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.500
-You're not actually--
-No, no, I'm still...

01:54.897 --> 01:57.334
Sorry. [stammers]
It's suddenly so weird

01:57.421 --> 02:00.076
to just be staring
in the eyes of...

02:00.163 --> 02:01.860
The charming man
I used to be.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.299
Yeah.

02:05.386 --> 02:09.390
And how long will this
hallucination last?

02:09.477 --> 02:11.827
A minute, a year.
I have no clue.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.395
I mean, it's not like
I'm doing this consciously.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.397
It's like this new world.
This green all around us.

02:16.484 --> 02:19.400
It's like it reacts
to my thoughts
and my feelings and...

02:23.143 --> 02:26.015
I think it sensed
how much I wanted you
to see me as myself again.

02:28.931 --> 02:33.718
You know, how much I, uh,
longed for that connection.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.598
-Uh...
-So, uh...

02:45.382 --> 02:49.560
-Can I get you something?
-[chuckles] Um...

02:49.647 --> 02:50.909
You know, now that
you mention it,

02:50.996 --> 02:52.389
I haven't
actually eaten anything

02:52.476 --> 02:53.912
since yesterday morning,
so I--

02:53.999 --> 02:56.263
Oh, no, no, no, no,
that won't do.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.829
Um...

02:57.916 --> 02:59.353
There may be some crackers
over here.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.664
-Alec?
-Hmm?

03:22.463 --> 03:23.812
All right.

03:23.899 --> 03:27.685
Well, looks like we got
some guava, plums,

03:27.772 --> 03:30.732
-mango maybe.
-Uh, plum.

03:30.819 --> 03:31.689
Plum.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.100
What's the verdict?

03:51.187 --> 03:53.233
It's so good!

03:53.320 --> 03:55.670
Okay, so you can just
make this happen
out of thin air?

03:55.757 --> 03:58.542
I was just concerned
about you being hungry,
and the green...

03:58.629 --> 04:00.979
Well, tell the green
thank you very much.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.894
This is, this is...
It's delicious.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.722
[chuckles]

04:04.809 --> 04:05.984
[indistinct whispering]

04:06.071 --> 04:06.898
You hear that?

04:09.161 --> 04:12.077
Everything is starting
to wake up.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.819
Duckweed, sawgrass,
phlox flower.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.737
And all those kudzu,
noisy bastards. Jeez.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.566
-You can hear
the plants waking up?
-[chuckles]

04:22.653 --> 04:24.525
Plants are much more
sensitive than animals.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.440
Their voices are
just a little quieter.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.616
[Alec] Hmm.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.009
[plants whispering
indistinctly]

04:31.096 --> 04:32.750
And they're trying
to tell me something.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.015
About the "darkness"?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.422
God, there's so much
unimaginable beauty
out there, Abby.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.688
So much death.

04:57.775 --> 05:02.867
I've seen things, places
where the rot and decay
have taken over

05:02.954 --> 05:06.306
and destroyed all life,
consuming everything
in its path.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.742
Show me.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.921
Whatever's gotten a hold you,
it was born in the swamp.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.618
I need to understand
this darkness,

05:14.705 --> 05:17.882
this, this "rot",
if I'm ever gonna cure you.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.493
No, Abby!

05:20.842 --> 05:23.671
Abby! Abby, wait up.

05:23.758 --> 05:27.457
Damn it! Just wait
a minute. Wait.
Stop. Listen.

05:27.544 --> 05:30.242
Entering this area,
where the rot has taken over,
is very dangerous.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.202
Okay, and dangerous plants
can sometimes produce

05:33.289 --> 05:35.335
-the most effective medicine.
-I understand that.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.554
And believe me,
no one wants that medicine
more than I do, trust me,

05:37.641 --> 05:38.990
but not at the risk
of losing your life.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.993
I am a CDC doctor.
This is what I do.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.038
We're going.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.130
[theme music playing]

06:48.320 --> 06:50.061
[country music playing
on radio]

06:50.148 --> 06:52.412
-[door bell dings]
-[sighs]

06:58.722 --> 07:00.463
[Liz] Sherriff's department
run out of Folgers?

07:02.683 --> 07:04.336
Just felt like
a change of scenery.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.210
[Liz] Transfer request.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.430
That's more than moving
from the bar to a booth.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.650
You're out of sugar.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.783
All right.
None of my business.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.002
[sighs]

07:23.573 --> 07:25.923
So, the police scanner
placed you
and a couple of detectives

07:26.010 --> 07:27.664
deep in the swamp
last night,

07:27.751 --> 07:30.624
looking for the bad boy
who attacked those hunters.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.234
Any luck?

07:32.321 --> 07:34.105
Maybe you should ask Abby.

07:34.192 --> 07:37.369
I would, except I haven't
seen her this morning.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.546
Don't suppose
you happen to know
where she's at?

07:39.633 --> 07:40.764
You don't have to
keep hiding it, Liz.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.418
I'm sure
Abby already told you.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.550
Told me...

07:46.204 --> 07:49.643
-About Alec Holland.
-What about him?

07:49.730 --> 07:51.775
Look, I've seen him, Liz.
I know everything.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.864
You've seen him? And Abby?

07:53.951 --> 07:55.736
Are they all right?

07:55.823 --> 07:57.912
Don't worry.
Last time I saw them,
they were fine.

07:57.999 --> 08:01.219
But Abby's protecting him.
She still thinks she can...

08:01.306 --> 08:02.917
I don't know,
bring him back.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.224
Matt, how long
have I known you?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.663
Third grade,
Mr. Perkin's class.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.274
Long enough to know
this pensive thing isn't you.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.320
What is it
you're not telling me?

08:17.845 --> 08:19.499
I'm scared.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.588
Abby keeps talking about
this darkness in Marais,

08:21.675 --> 08:23.415
like there's this poison

08:23.503 --> 08:25.026
coming off the swamp,
you know?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.507
And you're thinking
she sounds crazy.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.335
Worse.

08:30.422 --> 08:31.902
I'm thinking she's right.

08:34.035 --> 08:38.213
[music playing softly
on radio]

08:38.300 --> 08:41.433
I don't understand it.
I told Woodrue to go
easy on the numbers.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.785
Well, you hired
Dr. Woodrue because
he's the best.

08:44.872 --> 08:48.528
Doesn't mean he's easy
to understand.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.617
Yeah. No, honey,
you didn't have to
do all this.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.880
I would have been happy
bringing in a caterer.

08:52.967 --> 08:56.274
A man like Mr. Ellery
is used to catered meals.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.060
What he probably
doesn't have much of
is home cooking.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.540
Well, that could be.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.108
Hey, that medication
he prescribed,

09:04.195 --> 09:07.024
it really seems to be
lifting your spirits.

09:07.111 --> 09:11.725
It's true.
I feel so... relaxed.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.553
-Huh...
-[Maria] Hmm.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.946
So, what do you know about
this Mr. Nathan Ellery anyway?

09:16.033 --> 09:18.906
Very little, which seems
to be the way he likes it.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.604
I just know that
he's senior advisor
for the Conclave Group.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.388
Conclave Group.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.260
Sounds like something
out of a spy novel.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.957
[chuckles]

09:27.044 --> 09:29.699
All I know is they've given
hundreds of millions

09:29.786 --> 09:33.877
to all kinds of start-ups.
Healthcare, pharmaceuticals,

09:33.964 --> 09:37.315
weapons development,
aerospace.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.580
Well, I asked Nadine
to whip up a pitcher
of Sazerac,

09:40.667 --> 09:42.756
which will pair nicely
with the canapes,

09:42.843 --> 09:45.759
and then, we'll move on
to trout amandine,

09:45.846 --> 09:48.326
pan fried farro
and mustard greens.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.939
[chuckles] Look at you!

09:52.026 --> 09:54.158
-Playing the Southern belle.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.638
[both laughing]

09:55.725 --> 09:57.509
[doorbell rings]

09:57.597 --> 10:00.948
Oh, that must be Floyd
with the orchids.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.124
Mr. Sunderland,
the Sheriff would
like a word.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.171
-[Maria] Oh.
-Mrs. Sunderland.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.652
Sheriff Cable.
What a surprise.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.915
I'm sorry to
interrupt y'all,

10:12.002 --> 10:14.875
but I need to borrow you
for a minute, Avery.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.747
-Police business.
-Oh.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.445
You go on. I've got
a few things to sort out.

10:22.752 --> 10:23.840
[Avery] Well...

10:31.892 --> 10:33.458
I've told you
a hundred times

10:33.545 --> 10:34.808
never to come here
without calling.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.811
You son of a bitch!

10:37.898 --> 10:39.856
You wanted him dead,
but you didn't have
the guts to do it yourself

10:39.943 --> 10:42.424
so you blackmailed Matt?
You dragged my son
into a fucking murder.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
I should have known
that mama's boy couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.606
I always knew that
a part of you was like
a goddamn snake, Avery.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.609
I never, ever thought
that snake was coming
after me.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.656
But the truth is,
everything you touch
goes to hell,

10:56.743 --> 10:59.963
this town, me, Matt.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.878
And the worst part
about it is for 30 years,

11:01.965 --> 11:03.401
I just stood by
and let it all happen.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.099
Yeah, well, I don't
recall you complaining

11:05.186 --> 11:07.797
when all my dirty business
was lining your pockets.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.277
Fuck you, Avery.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.717
I'll tell you what,
when you come off
your high horse,

11:14.804 --> 11:16.327
why don't you
come over here

11:16.414 --> 11:17.633
and make yourself a drink
then show yourself out.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.895
I got a meeting
to prepare for.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.505
The hell you do.
This isn't finished.

11:21.637 --> 11:22.769
[exhales, sniffles]

11:22.856 --> 11:24.031
What are you talking about?

11:24.118 --> 11:26.511
Alec Holland is alive.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.948
Bullshit!

11:29.079 --> 11:30.341
No way he survived.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.474
Matt saw him.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.606
He says he's been deformed
by some offshoot
of that plant disease,

11:34.694 --> 11:35.999
but it's Holland all right.
And I'll tell you,

11:36.086 --> 11:38.001
if he gets to town
and starts talking,

11:38.088 --> 11:40.569
all three of us
are going down for
murder and conspiracy.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.920
I'll handle it.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.096
Oh, no. You will not
vomit out your dirty work
on this one.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.751
Mmm-mmm.

11:48.838 --> 11:52.755
We're gonna do this,
you and me, right now.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.366
-You're out of your mind.
-No, I'm protecting my son.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.109
And this is
not a negotiation.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.111
This is me telling you
how it's gonna do down.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.465
Holland. Alive...

12:10.338 --> 12:11.165
Shit!

12:15.822 --> 12:18.085
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.783
Something's come up,
and I gotta go out
for a bit.

12:20.870 --> 12:24.047
Lucilia needs me
to smooth things over
with a certain judge...

12:24.134 --> 12:26.136
Uh, our guests
shouldn't be until 7:00,

12:26.223 --> 12:28.443
so I'll be back
in plenty of time.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.576
Well, all right.
Nadine and I will make sure
that everything's ready.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.535
Okay.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.189
I'll get him back home
to you as soon as I can,
Mrs. Sunderland.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.668
All right.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.149
Okay.

12:46.896 --> 12:50.465
I've spent
my entire childhood
in Marais,

12:50.552 --> 12:52.119
hours in this swamp,

12:52.206 --> 12:55.905
and I don't think
I've seen it
this lush before.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.908
Plums appear,
flowers bloom.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.782
How is any of this happening?

13:02.869 --> 13:06.220
It's, uh...
It's a little hard
to explain.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.875
Only that it's not
connected to a world

13:08.962 --> 13:10.485
that has anything
to do with logic.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.443
Or science.

13:12.530 --> 13:17.100
Well, science is real,
it's profound,

13:17.187 --> 13:21.061
but now I know
that there's other parts
of this world

13:21.148 --> 13:22.627
that are just as profound,
just as natural.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.673
Like the green.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.023
It's more than that.
There are these
unseen forces

13:27.110 --> 13:29.417
that play all around us.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.985
Forces of life and death.

13:32.072 --> 13:36.467
In the best of times,
they work against each other
in a, kind of, harmony.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.992
Keeping a balance.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.820
And then, there are
times and places

13:40.907 --> 13:45.389
where the darker elements,
the death and the rot.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.178
It takes over,
drowns out the green.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.310
[wood creaking]

13:54.485 --> 13:55.443
What was that?

13:57.445 --> 13:58.402
It's trees.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.579
They're in pain.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.149
[trees creaking, groaning]

14:08.848 --> 14:10.197
Oh, my God.

14:13.983 --> 14:17.857
Chainsaws, toxins,
the accelerant
someone's been dumping.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.425
It's lashing out in anger.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.690
What are you doing?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.997
-I need to get a sample
to take back to the lab.
-No.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.478
[Abby] If this is the source
of the biological anomalies
affecting Marais,

14:30.565 --> 14:32.915
-we need to understand it.
-You're not listening to me.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.699
We're not going any further.
It's too dangerous.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.179
-There could be a wealth
of knowledge in there...
-Abby.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.789
...that could lead us
towards a cure.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.661
I'm not going back
without a specimen.

14:39.748 --> 14:40.575
Abby.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.536
[knocking on door]

14:47.974 --> 14:50.106
-Mrs. Sunderland.
-Doctor.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.065
We have to talk.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.285
Well, if this is about
tonight's dress code,

14:55.372 --> 14:58.245
Caroline assures me that
I'll be in proper attire.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.596
Actually, I was hoping
we could talk about
your work.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.642
I've been going over
your report,

15:04.729 --> 15:08.864
and I like to keep
the conversation moving
at the dinner table.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.039
I was having
a little trouble

15:10.126 --> 15:11.911
understanding
your conclusions.

15:11.998 --> 15:16.480
Uh, I don't write
for a lay audience,
Mrs. Sunderland.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.005
If your husband wants
complex biochemistry

15:19.092 --> 15:21.398
distilled down
into something
more digestible,

15:21.485 --> 15:23.052
-then perhaps
I could, uh--
-I'm sorry.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.576
I should have
been more clear.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.797
It wasn't the science
that I was confused by,

15:28.884 --> 15:32.061
it was the part
where you deemed
your testing

15:32.148 --> 15:33.671
an unmitigated success.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.501
The man you revived
from a coma

15:37.588 --> 15:41.244
left here
strapped to a gurney,
writhing in pain.

15:41.331 --> 15:46.119
Side effects are always
part of the process,
Mrs. Sunderland.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.513
Perhaps if I had had
a wider patient pool
to select from,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.385
then we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.865
You don't have to be
defensive with me, Doctor.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.955
I just wanna know.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.696
If time and money
weren't an issue,

15:58.783 --> 16:02.178
are you confident
you could achieve
what you're promising here?

16:02.265 --> 16:06.443
Why are we even having
this conversation? Hmm?

16:06.530 --> 16:07.923
Where's Avery?

16:08.010 --> 16:11.579
Avery isn't here right now.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.103
Until he returns,
you'll be answering to me.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.192
Yes or no?

16:16.279 --> 16:19.152
Are you confident
you can deliver
what you're promising here?

16:24.374 --> 16:25.375
No doubt in my mind.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.337
Dinner's at 7:00.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.687
Don't be late.

16:48.398 --> 16:53.099
Some heavy duty ammo
for a renegade scientist.

16:53.186 --> 16:56.102
Holland walked away
from a shotgun
and dynamite the last time.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.017
I'm not taking any chances.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.024
Jesus, Avery, why did you
have to go kill him?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.287
That son of a bitch
made one mistake.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.288
What was that?

17:10.377 --> 17:11.856
Holland knew
what he was doing.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.991
If he just stuck
to his job, you know?

17:16.078 --> 17:18.428
Run his test,
filed his reports.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.691
But he overstepped.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.693
Stuck his nose
where it didn't belong.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.695
Well, imagine if he knew

17:24.782 --> 17:27.394
about all the years
that you were dumping
and over-logging,

17:27.481 --> 17:30.179
and dynamiting new channels,
imagine that.

17:32.529 --> 17:36.011
The swamp still owes me
a lot for my father.

17:36.098 --> 17:36.925
You know that.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.236
Holland was about to destroy
everything that I spent

17:43.323 --> 17:44.933
my entire life
trying to achieve,

17:45.020 --> 17:47.849
all the prosperity
I've been working my ass off

17:47.936 --> 17:50.721
to bring to this town,
to Marais.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.202
You mean all the prosperity
you've been putting
in your back pocket?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.162
Mmm-hmm.
And all that fucking money

17:56.249 --> 17:58.816
to all those people
who thought
you were nothing.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.427
Jesus, Avery, I've heard
this speech before.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.037
You've got to get
new material.

18:04.126 --> 18:09.000
All I'm saying is
he didn't leave me
much choice.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.785
So, you're just
another victim.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.311
Well, if your conscience
is bothering you so much,

18:15.398 --> 18:16.921
you better let me
handle this boy.

18:19.576 --> 18:20.969
You've still got
your service weapon.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.362
That's pretty good
for killing people, too,

18:22.449 --> 18:24.277
judging by the late
Remy Dubois.

18:26.975 --> 18:27.845
If you insist.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.547
Lead on.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.723
[Alec] It's getting
even worse.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.377
The rot's expanding faster.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.597
It's like this
with everything
it touches?

18:40.684 --> 18:43.034
All life.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.906
And this is what
it leaves behind.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.783
[wood cracking]

18:52.870 --> 18:55.221
[flies buzzing]

18:55.308 --> 18:56.657
[Abby] It's all dead.

18:57.701 --> 18:58.876
We can't stay here.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.662
I just need to get
a sample.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.077
Abby...

19:28.079 --> 19:31.213
We gotta go right now.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.650
The darkness,
it knows we're here.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.739
[screaming]

19:42.268 --> 19:44.270
-Let me look. Let me...
-There.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.275
Go, go, go.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.585
Go, go, go!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.989
Here. Let me do that.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.653
You realize Sunderland
should be running

20:19.740 --> 20:22.743
this dog and pony show,
not you.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.006
I wish that
you would reconsider

20:25.093 --> 20:26.442
and go back
to the school with me.

20:31.839 --> 20:37.453
The cure for your Alzheimer's
rests in the cells that I saw
under that microscope.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.890
I know it.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.198
You have a long row to hoe

20:43.285 --> 20:44.982
before your discovery
can be tailored

20:45.069 --> 20:46.723
-to a condition like mine.
-No.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.291
We've got time.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.861
I won't accept
anything else.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.404
[Avery] It's getting late.
I gotta go back.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.840
[Lucilia] No, no, no, no.
Just a couple of more minutes.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.973
This is the area
where Matt spotted him.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.584
I'm guessing that
he wouldn't have
wandered off far.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.414
We gotta get this done,
Avery.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.982
[Avery] If Holland's
really out here,

21:28.069 --> 21:29.288
we could come back
in the morning.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.419
[whispering] Wait.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.077
Did you see that?

21:36.164 --> 21:38.035
You see, there's something
moving right there.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.953
-Avery.
-How stupid
do you think I am?

21:43.040 --> 21:43.867
Don't!

21:45.652 --> 21:46.914
What are you waiting for?

21:47.001 --> 21:48.481
What are you
waiting for, Luce?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.396
You're waiting for your
partner to show up,

21:50.483 --> 21:51.875
or maybe just looking
for a good place
to dump my body?

21:51.962 --> 21:54.835
No. Put the gun down.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.403
You think I really believe
that bullshit about Holland
still being alive?

21:57.490 --> 21:58.969
-It's true.
-Even if it were,

21:59.056 --> 22:00.667
it wouldn't make
any difference

22:00.754 --> 22:02.321
'cause I know you.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
You don't forget.

22:06.673 --> 22:07.848
You don't forgive.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.066
So, is that it?
You're just...

22:09.153 --> 22:10.285
[chuckles]

22:10.372 --> 22:12.026
You're just gonna
shoot me?

22:12.113 --> 22:13.854
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't do that.

22:15.812 --> 22:19.033
Because I'm the only person
left on earth who knows you.

22:21.252 --> 22:24.952
Because I'm the only person
left on earth who sees you.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.391
After everything
we've been through.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.962
-I thought...
-What did you think?

22:36.616 --> 22:38.922
I thought
that you loved me.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.837
-I do love you.
-[gun cocks]

22:40.924 --> 22:42.448
Please, Avery.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.188
[both grunt]

22:53.546 --> 22:56.070
For a second, I thought
you'd changed your mind.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.855
GPS crapped out.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.901
-Let's finish this.
-No, no, no, no, not here.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.816
Out on the water.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.208
I don't wanna
take any chance

23:04.295 --> 23:06.210
and leave any
blood evidence behind

23:06.297 --> 23:08.256
or anybody finding
the body, okay?

23:08.343 --> 23:09.953
So, you give me this.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.959
Mr. Ellery, Maria Sunderland.
It's so nice to meet you.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.439
Please.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.399
My husband, Avery,
and I are so honored

24:04.486 --> 24:07.402
that you came all the way
down here to see us.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.535
-How was your trip?
-Long.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.973
Your little town here
is pretty far off
the beaten path.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.976
Quaint, though,
if you like
that sort of thing.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.240
Well, it's Louisiana's
best kept secret.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.068
Avery had to run an errand,

24:21.155 --> 24:24.332
but I know he's so excited
to share his results with you.

24:24.419 --> 24:27.596
Dinner isn't quite ready yet,
but why don't you join me

24:27.683 --> 24:30.077
for a cocktail
and some crab maison.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.253
[exhales heavily]

24:32.340 --> 24:34.951
Vodka martini.
Up with a twist.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.083
Mmm.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.048
[Alec] It's okay.
We'll just get
over here.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.310
[Abby] Alec?

24:48.530 --> 24:49.531
Let me see it.

24:51.446 --> 24:54.057
-Take this off. Come on.
-[groaning]

24:54.144 --> 24:55.885
Stay right here.
Just relax right now, okay?

24:57.234 --> 24:59.062
What was that thing
that bit me?

24:59.149 --> 25:00.890
Some kind of tendril
coming from the rot.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.370
What?

25:02.457 --> 25:03.327
It's a wound. It's, uh...

25:06.505 --> 25:08.115
It's a necrotizing fasciitis.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.812
It is a flesh-eating bacteria.

25:09.899 --> 25:10.944
Something like that, yeah.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.860
[Abby groans]

25:14.600 --> 25:16.558
The darkness.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.168
[screams]

25:18.255 --> 25:19.996
Abby. Abby, we need to go
to a hospital right now.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.694
I won't make it
to the hospital.

25:27.743 --> 25:31.442
There are plants,
Chinese lantern,
it's a powerful antiseptic.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.140
They don't grow
around here.
Listen to me.

25:33.227 --> 25:36.056
But they grow somewhere.
They grow somewhere.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.623
You can bring them.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
[Abby groans, pants]

25:46.066 --> 25:48.547
[plants whispering
indistinctly]

25:51.811 --> 25:52.899
[gasps]

25:59.383 --> 26:00.950
Stay right here.
Stay right here.

26:08.305 --> 26:11.265
Swallow these.
Swallow. Swallow.

26:11.352 --> 26:13.267
Look at me.
Look at me. Yes?
What's happening?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.968
[Abby breathing heavily]

26:19.055 --> 26:20.404
It's not working.
It's not working.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.884
Rot's fighting back. Okay.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.888
-Rot's fighting back.
-[screaming]

26:28.108 --> 26:30.023
-[thunder rumbling]
-[boat engine thrumming]

26:41.251 --> 26:42.601
[groans, breathing softly]

26:43.514 --> 26:45.038
He's moving.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.475
[Avery grunts]

26:51.784 --> 26:54.438
[Avery laughs]

26:54.525 --> 26:58.094
Well, I didn't think
you had the guts, boy.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.661
Shut up.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.054
This is as good a place
as any.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.490
What the hell's
going on here?

27:02.577 --> 27:04.361
Second fucking thoughts?

27:04.448 --> 27:06.450
Oh, no,
this is gonna happen.

27:06.537 --> 27:09.453
You turned my Matty
into a murderer.
You crossed the line, Avery.

27:10.803 --> 27:11.717
[cocks gun]

27:13.544 --> 27:15.590
You sure you can
live with this, boy?

27:15.677 --> 27:16.939
[Matt] Live with what?

27:17.026 --> 27:18.680
Getting rid
of a monster like you

27:18.767 --> 27:20.116
before you drag me down
like the rest of this town?

27:20.203 --> 27:21.814
[Avery] No,
I'm just wondering

27:21.901 --> 27:24.599
if you could live with
killing your own father.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.126
-What the hell
is he talking about?
-That's right.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.389
What did you think?
That I was gonna take
your word for it?

27:32.476 --> 27:34.130
That he was
someone else's child?

27:34.217 --> 27:36.393
I had a feeling
the minute I saw him.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.223
Paid off some doctors.
They had Matt's samples.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.529
-Is this true?
-Son of a bitch.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.836
He's my son, too!

27:43.923 --> 27:45.968
-All these years,
you already knew.
-Give me the shotgun.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.014
No, you fucking knew?
I wanna know the truth!

27:48.101 --> 27:49.624
-Give me the shotgun!
-I wanna know the truth!

27:49.711 --> 27:51.887
[Matt] Forget about
the fucking gun right now!

27:51.974 --> 27:52.975
[Matt screams]

27:57.197 --> 27:58.372
[Avery] God dammit!

28:00.330 --> 28:01.636
[Avery groans]

28:14.997 --> 28:18.479
Is he dead? Is he dead?
Is he dead? [grunts]

28:18.566 --> 28:22.135
Keep some pressure
on this, okay?
We'll go get help.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.922
[boat engine sputtering,
thrumming]

28:31.318 --> 28:32.145
[gasps]

28:33.886 --> 28:35.365
Abby. I know, I know.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.324
-What's happening to me?
-It's okay. Just relax.

28:39.239 --> 28:40.544
[Abby groans]

28:40.631 --> 28:41.981
It's a war inside of you

28:42.068 --> 28:42.895
between the rot
and the green.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.070
[gasping]

28:46.333 --> 28:49.989
Hold on, hold on.
There's 200 species
of flora inside your body.

28:50.076 --> 28:53.514
If I could coax
them all to grow
and to heal...

29:01.740 --> 29:03.524
[screaming]

29:14.448 --> 29:16.276
[gasping]

29:19.583 --> 29:22.064
[screaming]

29:32.205 --> 29:33.075
Abby.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.642
Abby.

29:39.081 --> 29:42.302
Again, I'm so sorry
that Avery's been delayed.

29:42.389 --> 29:45.087
But, in the meantime,
you should have a slice
of my pecan pie.

29:45.174 --> 29:48.787
The nuts are harvested
from trees right here
on the property.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.660
To be frank, I didn't
come for the cuisine.

29:52.747 --> 29:53.879
I was promised data

29:53.966 --> 29:56.272
regarding
a major breakthrough.

29:56.359 --> 30:00.407
Your husband called in
every favor he had
to get this meeting,

30:00.494 --> 30:05.238
and now, he can't be
bothered to show?

30:05.325 --> 30:08.589
I truly appreciate
the value of your time.

30:08.676 --> 30:11.461
And after reviewing the work
of the Conclave Group,

30:11.548 --> 30:13.768
and especially
your involvement

30:13.855 --> 30:15.422
in the Mod Four project.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.556
How do you know
about Mod Four?

30:19.643 --> 30:21.645
Well, I may be
a small-town girl,

30:21.732 --> 30:23.909
but I still have
a few friends
in high places.

30:26.781 --> 30:27.608
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.441
Since Avery is indisposed,
um, Nadine,

30:34.528 --> 30:37.836
perhaps Dr. Woodrue
would walk us through
the prospectus.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.099
Yes.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.753
Um, of course.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.582
Uh...

30:45.669 --> 30:49.064
If you go to page three,
you'll see that we began

30:49.151 --> 30:52.589
with a naturally occurring
bio-organic compound

30:52.676 --> 30:55.331
that's heavily comprised
of lignin and chlorophyll.

30:55.418 --> 30:58.726
The patient,
our first test subject,

30:58.813 --> 31:01.120
suffered a severe
brain injury,

31:01.207 --> 31:04.471
and was diagnosed
level 7 comatose.

31:04.558 --> 31:08.823
But after less than
12 hours of dosing with
Dr. Woodrue's formula,

31:08.910 --> 31:12.131
he regained
complete consciousness

31:12.218 --> 31:13.697
two days after his injury.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.918
Interesting.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.790
The material
we're working with
is a living tissue

31:19.878 --> 31:22.619
developed right here
in our laboratory,

31:22.706 --> 31:25.753
and has the ability to mutate
thousands of times faster

31:25.840 --> 31:29.235
than anything else known
to man or nature.

31:32.107 --> 31:32.891
[Ellery] Mmm-hmm.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.112
You made this yourself?

31:37.199 --> 31:40.289
Local pecans,
that's the secret.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.345
Now, if you would
please turn to page seven.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.093
[thunder rumbles]

32:19.938 --> 32:20.764
Abby.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.159
Hey.

32:26.466 --> 32:29.034
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.095
Thank you.

32:50.881 --> 32:51.926
Of course.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.413
What? What is it?

33:01.936 --> 33:02.763
Nothing.

33:03.590 --> 33:04.939
Just the spores.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.247
They're wearing off.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.902
Yeah.

33:11.990 --> 33:16.342
Well... it was fun
to be Alec for a day.

33:20.476 --> 33:21.477
Come here.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.613
We don't know
what's going to happen.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.795
All we have
is right here, right now.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.105
You just saved my life.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.891
Yeah.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.958
You should get some rest.

34:24.497 --> 34:27.413
[sighs]
Well, we did it.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.416
Full funding.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.288
Proper lab equipment,
support staff.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.160
[exhales]

34:35.247 --> 34:36.900
It's all finally happening.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.121
And you'll be
the first to benefit.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.216
Did you enjoy dinner?

34:49.913 --> 34:51.263
It was delicious.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.920
I only ask because, uh...

34:58.226 --> 35:00.402
you seemed so quiet.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.013
I was having a lovely time.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.929
But who was
that other couple
at the table?

35:08.758 --> 35:12.240
Um, that man was named
Nathan Ellery.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.242
Oh.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.376
And his wife?

35:19.552 --> 35:23.077
Maria. Her name was Maria.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.863
They seem very nice.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.611
I'm very tired.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.179
Of course.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.053
Goodnight, sweetheart.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.022
-[Matt panting]
-[Lucilia]
Hang in there, Matty.

35:55.109 --> 35:58.112
God damn it, Mom.
You lied to me
all these years.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.940
I made a mistake, Matty.

36:00.027 --> 36:03.378
-Why couldn't you
just tell me, huh?
-I was ashamed.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.511
I couldn't bear the idea
of Avery being in your life,

36:05.598 --> 36:07.513
of you looking up
to that horrible man
as your father.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.384
You did it all for me, huh?
[groans]

36:12.866 --> 36:14.215
Over here.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.405
[knocking on door]

36:34.496 --> 36:35.802
[knocking on door]

36:38.848 --> 36:40.546
[Matt shuddering]

36:40.633 --> 36:42.504
-What the hell?
-We need to come in.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.114
Jesus Christ,
you can't be here.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.029
Maria, Matt is bleeding out.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.814
-Let us in.
-Who the hell is this?

36:47.901 --> 36:49.511
That's Doctor Fred.
I called him
from the boat.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.644
Look, you think
I wanna be here?

36:51.731 --> 36:53.950
I can't exactly bring Matt
to the hospital
with a knife wound.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.561
-Please.
-[Matt groaning heavily]

36:55.648 --> 36:57.519
All right, bring him
into the kitchen.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.913
-[Matt grunting]
-It's okay.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.834
[Matt grunting]

37:13.187 --> 37:14.754
Drink it, Matty.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.238
This was not
part of the plan.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.983
Sorry for the inconvenience,

37:27.070 --> 37:29.377
but I didn't expect
the bastard to stab my son.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.775
Did you get them
to sign the paperwork?

37:35.862 --> 37:37.342
Yes.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.782
Woodrue did his part,
and the pecan pie
sealed the deal.

37:46.742 --> 37:47.743
Avery.

37:53.009 --> 37:53.923
He's dead.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.898
Cheer up, buttercup.
It worked.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.727
The company is yours.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.251
Forgive me if I don't gloat
over the death of my husband.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.690
All the lies
and manipulation.

38:21.777 --> 38:22.909
[Matt grunting]

38:31.526 --> 38:32.919
It's been a while.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.834
Yeah, well, remember
to go by the station

38:34.921 --> 38:36.488
and file a missing
person's report.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.142
I should send someone out.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.320
I don't wanna see you again.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.104
We had a common goal,
Lucilia,

38:44.191 --> 38:47.325
and now that it's done,
I want you out of my life.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.370
You always did think
you were better than me.

38:53.505 --> 38:57.117
Make sure you clean up
all this blood before you go.

38:57.204 --> 38:59.641
I want my kitchen spotless
in the morning.

39:24.971 --> 39:25.928
You should go.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.889
I'll come back tomorrow.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.151
I don't think
that's a good idea.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.158
I've been thinking,
maybe there's a reason

39:38.245 --> 39:39.986
I've become
what I am, you know?
Like...

39:41.509 --> 39:43.772
Like I'm the part
of some larger plan.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.345
What, um...

39:51.432 --> 39:53.129
What kind of plan
are we talking about?

39:53.216 --> 39:55.131
I don't know, but it's...

39:55.218 --> 39:56.959
It's bigger
than you and me.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.529
That fight we saw
in your arm,

40:04.097 --> 40:05.403
it's all around us.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.188
Here, in this swamp.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.974
And it's a fight
to the death.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.025
Maybe I've been
turned into this thing

40:19.112 --> 40:20.853
to be a warrior
in that battle.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.944
Okay, but where does all that
leave Alec Holland?

40:27.294 --> 40:29.514
Alec couldn't have
saved your life.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.732
Only this thing
that I've become

40:30.819 --> 40:31.864
could do that.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.479
You've done
what you can, Abby.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.744
Thank you.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.007
But it's not your destiny,
it's mine.

40:45.094 --> 40:48.837
And you have a life to live,
and you need to go live it.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.797
If there is a battle to fight,
I wanna fight it with you.

40:51.884 --> 40:52.754
No.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.017
Alec.

40:55.104 --> 40:57.367
It's too dangerous
for you out here.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.588
This is my place.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.898
I want you to go,
and don't come back
here again.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.763
[boat engine thrumming]

42:01.910 --> 42:03.085
[sighs]

42:14.749 --> 42:15.968
Abby, where you been?

42:17.796 --> 42:19.275
I've been saying goodbye
to a friend.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.887
You mean Alec?

42:23.845 --> 42:25.194
Yeah.

42:26.152 --> 42:27.632
He's losing hope, Liz.

42:29.111 --> 42:30.896
I, um...

42:30.983 --> 42:33.115
I pulled a sample
from the swamp
that I think might help,

42:33.202 --> 42:36.510
but I'm gonna need
the full resources
of the CDC to investigate.

42:36.597 --> 42:37.729
Meaning?

42:38.730 --> 42:39.905
I'm going back to Atlanta.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.430
-Tonight.
-Atlanta?

42:44.300 --> 42:46.172
Are you sure?

42:46.259 --> 42:50.568
Well, I'm not sure
about anything anymore,

42:50.655 --> 42:53.614
but I have to help him.

42:53.701 --> 42:56.574
I know it.
I have to find a way.

43:12.938 --> 43:14.243
