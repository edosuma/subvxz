00:01.540 --> 00:03.290
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.290 --> 00:04.040
Connor: Mom?

00:04.040 --> 00:05.620
I know
about your misconduct.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.040
I can fix this
for you.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.080
You had
Nate's dad killed.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.580
No.

00:10.580 --> 00:11.380
Why aren't you
with your boo?

00:11.380 --> 00:12.250
He didn't come.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.380
Just saw him outside
with Nate.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.710
Why'd you call the Warden
that day?

00:14.710 --> 00:15.580
Own it!

00:17.290 --> 00:18.210
He murdered my pops.

00:19.290 --> 00:22.670
Take his car and him
and drive away.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.290
Why do you look like
someone just died?

00:24.290 --> 00:25.880
Gabriel is Sam's kid.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.210
You're making him out
to be some monster.

00:27.210 --> 00:28.750
He hurt all of us.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.170
I want to know
how he died.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.880
All Gabriel has to do
is find new evidence.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.040
He's here
to take us down.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.080
Woman:
Please record your message.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.670
I screwed up.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.170
They found out who I am.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.170
Hey.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.210
Hi.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.460
Can I have my ball back?

00:40.460 --> 00:41.500
Do I know you?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.830
You're going to
help me with this.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.040
Frank:
Delete this e-mail.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.420
Go upstairs to your wife
and love her.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.540
He never deserved you,
Annalise.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.330
Preacher: Every single day is
the chance for a new beginning,

00:58.330 --> 01:02.330
every morning an opportunity
to be changed,

01:02.330 --> 01:04.830
different...magnificent.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.330
We all have the choice to stay
mired in our own pain and mess,

01:11.330 --> 01:16.210
or we can try mending the
broken pieces inside ourselves.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.170
You here to make my face
look like yours?

01:23.170 --> 01:25.250
Maybe.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.670
Look, this wasn't about you,
okay?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.210
This was about two consenting
adults needing a connection --

01:28.210 --> 01:30.920
Never talk to me
about my mom again.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.540
Is he in there?
I don't know.
I haven't heard him all day.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.460
Maybe he's already turned us
in to the police.

01:35.460 --> 01:36.710
It's not easy believing
in ourselves.

01:36.710 --> 01:38.830
I hear talking.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.290
We all feel like there's some
thing inside us that's missing,

01:42.290 --> 01:47.080
and if only we could find it,
we'd finally feel whole.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.960
We just can't do that until we
learn to look inside ourselves.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.540
Where's Connor?
I need his help.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.540
He went for a run to take his
mind off the Gabriel stuff.

01:56.540 --> 01:58.040
That's why I need him --
we're gonna burn Gabriel

01:58.040 --> 01:59.420
from our brains
by writing up

01:59.420 --> 02:00.960
a wrongful death suit
for Nate Senior.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.880
Didn't Nate Junior ask you to
stop interfering in his life?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.170
He'll forgive me
once he sees

02:05.170 --> 02:06.750
that this is our last chance
at justice.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.540
Or you're just setting him up
for more disappointment.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.580
Hey.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.920
You're supposed to be
the hopeful one in this house.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.040
Don't go dark on me.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.670
But looking within is hard.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.330
It means seeing

02:21.330 --> 02:23.380
not only
the good parts of ourselves,

02:23.380 --> 02:24.620
but the bad.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.380
What did you see,
precioso?

02:31.710 --> 02:33.620
Mama.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.040
It means recognizing
our own weaknesses

02:40.040 --> 02:41.620
and flaws and wounds.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.710
Bonnie: You've reached
Bonnie Winterbottom.

02:44.710 --> 02:45.920
Please leave a message.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.790
Preacher:
Only then can we start to heal.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.960
Annalise doesn't need us dumping
another problem on her.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.500
She also doesn't need
to be blindsided again.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.540
This is not
her problem to fix.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.120
Then at least tell me
what you did with the body.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.170
Doesn't matter.
It will when
the cops find it

03:00.170 --> 03:01.330
and you two
are thrown in jail.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.540
That's not gonna happen.
Look at your hands.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.540
You're gonna be
the main suspect the second

03:05.540 --> 03:06.790
Miller's identified
as missing.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.790
This is my life, my mistake.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.460
It wasn't a mistake.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.290
This is Nate's call.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.960
Fine.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.420
But as soon as it's out
that Miller's M.I.A.,

03:19.420 --> 03:20.880
one of you is telling her.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.960
Yeah. We'll see.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.580
What did we agree on?

03:26.580 --> 03:27.790
I'm calling Eve.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.250
Annalise:
What the hell do you want?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.250
Annalise?
Do I sound like Eve?

03:33.250 --> 03:34.750
Are you in San Fran?

03:34.750 --> 03:36.210
No.
Eve's here?

03:36.210 --> 03:37.670
Let me come over.

03:37.670 --> 03:39.460
We'll figure out
how to handle Gabriel.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.250
I talked to him last night.
He's fine.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.750
Annalise,
what does that mean?

03:46.380 --> 03:49.290
Why don't you bring over
your Gabriel file?

03:49.290 --> 03:51.000
Eve would like
to say hi, too.

03:57.710 --> 04:00.120
She's not happy.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.580
Shower to wash away
your guilt?

04:01.580 --> 04:02.790
Some.

04:05.460 --> 04:06.500
You ready to talk?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.330
To yell.

04:08.330 --> 04:09.750
Let me get dressed.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.250
We'll go at it.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.120
Can't wait.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.580
Okay, I'm, uh --
I'm ready.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.080
Armor's on.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.830
Why?

04:33.830 --> 04:35.540
You'd just lost the baby,

04:35.540 --> 04:36.960
wouldn't answer my calls.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.250
I was in grief.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.210
That's why I was worried
about you.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.120
Oh, so you hacked
Sam's e-mail

04:42.120 --> 04:43.500
because you were
worrying about me?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.000
I was afraid he'd leave you

04:45.000 --> 04:46.080
when you needed him
the most.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.380
You wanted him
to leave me.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.500
No, I wanted to help you
save your marriage.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.040
That marriage was over
when our son died.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.380
We stayed together
when we shouldn't have.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.120
Why didn't you tell me?

04:59.620 --> 05:01.290
Why?

05:01.290 --> 05:03.170
I thought I did
what was best for you.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.670
I was wrong.

05:07.670 --> 05:11.380
So I'm here
to make it right.

05:11.380 --> 05:14.710
Gabriel's worked with activist
groups on FBI watch lists.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.880
If he tries to get
Sam's case reopened,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.540
we threaten him
with conspiracy charges.
No.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.880
He's a kid who thinks
he's more powerful than he is.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.580
This isn't just about him.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.040
The Governor knows that
I tried to adopt Wes.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.750
That's enough for her
to link me with Sam's killer

05:29.750 --> 05:32.580
and reopen the case.

05:32.580 --> 05:36.540
Now that kid Gabriel is here,
picking at the scab, so...

05:39.210 --> 05:41.080
Any more bright ideas?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.540
Bonnie:
He wanted to go public.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.920
I wasn't ready.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.830
So I told him not to come
to the wedding.

05:51.830 --> 05:54.460
He showed up anyway.

05:54.460 --> 05:59.040
I got pissed
and broke up with him.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.500
That's the last time
I saw him.

06:08.670 --> 06:09.880
What is it?

06:11.750 --> 06:13.040
There was a ring.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.460
I left it on him.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.790
But a purchase that big
will get noticed.

06:21.790 --> 06:24.040
And I'd rather you
hear it from me than the Feds.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.580
I'm sorry.

06:29.580 --> 06:31.040
He brought this
on himself.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.380
I gotta say I never saw him
at the wedding.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.920
I was in the tent
most of the night.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.750
You saw me there
and drove me home.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.540
It's not gonna work.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.790
It's just a cleaner story.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.580
Asher saw you with him.

07:01.710 --> 07:04.170
Asher, why does Bonnie
need to see you ASAP?

07:04.170 --> 07:05.710
Asher: No idea.
Maybe it's
about Gabriel.

07:05.710 --> 07:07.420
I said no more
obsessing over Gabriel.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.540
Obsessing about the guy
who could lock us all up

07:09.540 --> 07:10.960
isn't such a bad idea.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.540
It is when we should be
spending that time

07:12.540 --> 07:14.000
suing the state
for killing

07:14.000 --> 07:15.460
an innocent,
mentally ill black man.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.080
Where was this altruism

07:17.080 --> 07:19.460
when you decided to
deport a gay DACA student?

07:19.460 --> 07:20.960
All right, I'll be back
in an hour to help.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.540
Thanks, Asher.

07:24.330 --> 07:25.920
Hey.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.330
Gang, look who it is.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.920
Aren't you two supposed
to be on your honeymoon?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.670
Uh, we're going after
Connor graduates.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.420
Right on.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.000
Michaela,
you got a minute to talk?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.670
She doesn't really
want to talk to you.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.880
That's right.
She doesn't.
Just let me explain.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.960
You ditched me at a wedding that
you begged me to take you to.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.880
I think I understand.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.210
That wasn't about you.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.500
Yeah, I think that's
part of her problem.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.920
Look, I had to leave
to talk to Professor Keating.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.670
She was at the wedding.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.670
I saw her leave
without her keys.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.580
She wasn't home when I got
there, so I waited.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.330
Why?

08:01.330 --> 08:02.880
That's what I want
to talk about.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.750
Then talk so you can
finally leave us alone.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.750
Sam Keating's my father.

08:10.330 --> 08:12.210
Look, I know I should've
told you all.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.880
But you didn't.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.120
I just want to know
what happened to him.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.540
That's why I came to Middleton,

08:19.540 --> 08:21.670
and that's why
I'm here right now.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.210
To see what you guys
can tell me.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.500
Professor Keating worked
out of the house that year.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.000
You guys were all interns,
right?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.120
He was hardly ever there.

08:39.540 --> 08:40.540
Look, I get it.

08:40.540 --> 08:41.670
You don't want to
talk about this.

08:41.670 --> 08:42.880
Michaela:
Why would we?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.670
You've been lying to us
this whole time,

08:44.670 --> 08:46.830
manipulating us
into kissing you.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.460
That's not what that was.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.790
Look, I never bought into
the story that Wes killed him.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.080
So, what, you thought you'd
come here and solve a case

08:55.080 --> 08:57.210
that the D.A. closed?
Asher: Seriously.

08:57.210 --> 08:58.580
You better not be blaming
this on A.K.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.330
I mean, she -- she's already
been through enough.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.580
I know.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.880
I got that when
I talked to her last night.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.380
You actually talked to her?

09:05.380 --> 09:08.330
Yeah, she told me
Wes killed him.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.210
She even played me
a voicemail he left her.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.920
Then you know
everything.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.120
You don't think
he was covering for someone?

09:17.540 --> 09:19.040
What about you?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.500
I mean,
he's your kid's father.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.920
You think he did this alone?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.830
Yes. Because he did.
And honestly?

09:24.830 --> 09:27.290
I don't appreciate you barging
in here dredging all this up.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.040
Look, I know this is hard,

09:30.040 --> 09:32.790
but this is my dad
we're talking about.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.790
Yeah,
a dad you never knew, okay?

09:34.790 --> 09:36.620
Meanwhile,
Wes was someone that I loved,

09:36.620 --> 09:39.080
someone that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with

09:39.080 --> 09:41.710
until I realized
he was hiding

09:41.710 --> 09:42.920
the worst part of himself
from me.

09:51.670 --> 09:54.960
You should go.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.830
I've seen what Connor
can do when he's angry.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.620
I'd leave if I were you.

10:06.830 --> 10:09.920
I'm sorry. I really am.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.880
I might need to borrow
some fresh underwear.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.250
Where's everything
on Vivian?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.500
There's not much
out there on her.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.830
That you found out.

10:36.830 --> 10:39.080
Go see what else
you can dig up.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.080
Nice to see you.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.500
And gimme your phone.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.380
I'm cutting you two off.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.250
Where is she?

10:49.250 --> 10:51.750
It's saved under
"The One."

10:51.750 --> 10:53.620
I always thought you two
were end-game.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.120
Annalise and I are handling
Gabriel, okay?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.540
I just need sweet-O's help
finding dirt on his mom.

11:10.540 --> 11:11.750
So Oliver's handling it?

11:11.750 --> 11:13.120
I need blackmail.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.580
Just like we've got
on all you.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.170
You in?

11:17.170 --> 11:19.420
Only if you give me access
to Gabriel's spy cam.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.540
No.
He can just hack into it

11:21.540 --> 11:22.620
if you don't
give him access.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.000
She's right.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.250
How's Vanessa?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.620
Good.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.040
What is it?

12:04.500 --> 12:07.710
She's pregnant.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.040
It was our fifth try.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.880
I gave up on the idea of it
ever working,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.750
but she just
left the doctor, and...

12:13.750 --> 12:15.380
I'm sorry.
This is the last thing

12:15.380 --> 12:17.960
I want to be telling you,
Annalise.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.580
You said you never
wanted a kid.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.620
I didn't.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.710
I guess you just didn't
want one with me.

12:25.710 --> 12:26.620
Don't --

12:26.620 --> 12:28.040
Don't do this.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.500
What am I doing?

12:29.500 --> 12:30.920
Making me feel bad.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.540
Why should you feel bad?

12:32.540 --> 12:37.120
For being happy,
more than ever.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.670
But I can't tell you that
without feeling

12:38.670 --> 12:40.000
like it's a competition.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.460
I want you to be happy.
I can handle it.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.790
Are you drinking again?

12:50.250 --> 12:52.710
Did Frank tell you that?

12:52.710 --> 12:55.670
I saw it on your face
the minute I walked in the door.

13:05.750 --> 13:09.750
Your life is hard,
God knows,

13:09.750 --> 13:11.620
but you chose it,

13:11.620 --> 13:14.080
and you continue to
choose it every day.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.000
So there has to come a point
where you take responsibility

13:19.000 --> 13:22.880
for your own mistakes,

13:22.880 --> 13:24.830
or you can just
stay unhappy.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.750
There's some ice cream
in the freezer

13:33.750 --> 13:35.580
if you want some dessert.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.330
Nate: Was anyone with you

13:51.330 --> 13:56.380
when you saw me and Miller
outside the tent?

13:56.380 --> 13:59.000
No.
I was coming from the bathroom.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.920
Why?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.880
What did you see?

14:02.880 --> 14:06.620
Um, not much.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.620
I was by the church.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.880
You were both far away.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.460
And then?

14:11.460 --> 14:13.170
You disappeared
behind the tent.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.750
What's -- What's going on?

14:20.080 --> 14:23.500
You didn't see me
with Miller.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.750
I didn't?

14:25.750 --> 14:27.330
You saw Bonnie.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.670
She was with him
in the parking lot.

14:28.670 --> 14:29.920
Understood?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.830
Millstone?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.380
I need to know
what's going on.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.830
You don't want to know.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.540
I'm not lying to whoever
you want me to lie to

14:39.540 --> 14:40.790
unless you tell me the truth.

14:40.790 --> 14:42.380
Show him.

14:46.500 --> 14:50.120
This is Miller ordering
the Warden to kill Nate's dad.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.920
No, that's...

14:51.920 --> 14:53.250
Miller ordered the inquest.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.420
It was his cover.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.670
You're -- You're --
You're assuming that

14:56.670 --> 14:58.500
because he used a payphone?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.460
It was him, Asher.

15:04.040 --> 15:10.040
So...Miller won't be coming
back to work tomorrow

15:10.750 --> 15:14.080
because you were the last person
who saw him?

15:15.460 --> 15:16.960
Right.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.170
Think about all the times
Nate's helped you --

15:20.170 --> 15:23.830
after Sinclair, Simon...

15:23.830 --> 15:25.830
This is your turn
to help him.

15:37.830 --> 15:40.500
Everything's gonna move fast
once Monday comes

15:40.500 --> 15:41.960
and Miller doesn't
show for work.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.290
Peggy won't get him
on his cell,

15:46.290 --> 15:49.290
so she'll send someone
to his place.

15:49.290 --> 15:51.580
Peggy:
I know it's under 48 hours,

15:51.580 --> 15:54.460
but even his emergency contacts
can't reach him.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.330
And he's never late,
especially Monday morning.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.500
Protocol will require
the Investigation Division

15:59.500 --> 16:02.750
to open a missing person's case
immediately.

16:02.750 --> 16:06.460
From that point, you gotta act
like every move you make

16:06.460 --> 16:08.540
is being watched,
especially at work.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.620
A forensics team
will sweep

16:16.620 --> 16:18.460
Miller's office for evidence.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.830
And they'll put out
an APB on his car.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.960
It'll all turn up nothing.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.920
Why? What'd you do
with his car?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.790
Just focus on your part.

16:28.710 --> 16:30.040
He in there, Pegs?

16:31.620 --> 16:32.710
Asher.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.420
What the hell?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.000
Ron's missing.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.460
What?

16:39.460 --> 16:42.670
I know, it's like Denver
all over again.

16:42.670 --> 16:47.420
The FBI will be called in
'cause Denver was just killed.

16:47.420 --> 16:50.620
They'll send a team to
the office within hours.

16:50.620 --> 16:53.000
The police will hand over
Miller's cell records to them.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.960
They'll want to speak to
the last person he called.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.920
Ms. Winterbottom?
Special Agent Telesco.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.330
You free to answer
a few questions?

17:03.330 --> 17:04.830
What is this about?

17:04.830 --> 17:06.880
We'll get to that,

17:06.880 --> 17:08.460
but first I'd like you
to tell us a little bit

17:08.460 --> 17:11.040
about your role
here at the office.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.960
If this is a corruption
investigation,

17:12.960 --> 17:15.120
I'm not answering questions
unless my attorney is present.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.830
This isn't a corruption case.

17:16.830 --> 17:19.250
It's a missing person's.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.330
Who's missing?

17:25.080 --> 17:26.750
Who is missing?

17:26.750 --> 17:29.330
D.A. Miller.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.250
What are you
talking about?

17:31.250 --> 17:33.750
No one's been able to contact
or locate Ronald Miller

17:33.750 --> 17:36.080
for the last 36 hours.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.670
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:38.670 --> 17:41.120
Saturday night.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.790
Have you tried his mother?

17:42.790 --> 17:44.620
She lives in Lancaster.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.790
We wouldn't be here if we hadn't
looked into all leads already.

17:47.790 --> 17:51.670
Okay.

17:51.670 --> 17:56.330
But we had a fight on Saturday,
and we broke up, so --

17:56.330 --> 17:59.580
So you two were
seeing each other?

17:59.580 --> 18:03.210
Yes. For a few months.

18:03.210 --> 18:07.750
So maybe this is just him
taking some personal time or...

18:07.750 --> 18:10.540
To be clear, the last time you
spoke to him was Saturday night?

18:10.540 --> 18:11.750
Yes.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.170
Hey.

18:15.170 --> 18:17.920
This is the last time
you two spoke.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.380
Well, maybe it
was Sunday morning.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.380
It was the middle
of the night.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.170
He called me to
apologize, but...

18:27.210 --> 18:29.080
Are you sure this
isn't a mistake?

18:30.670 --> 18:32.500
Eve: That's perfect.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.420
Call my cell whenever
you have anything.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.500
My friend who's a P.I.
in Cook County.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.500
She's checking for
everything on Vivian.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.750
You're allowed
to go home now.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.170
I can handle it
from now on.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.460
I came here to help,
Annalise.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.880
And you did that.
So now you can leave.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.380
Well, you can leave, too.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.080
"Wherever you go,
there you are."

18:51.080 --> 18:52.750
That's what they
tell us in AA.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.000
You deserve to
have some peace.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.460
That's all I'm saying.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.580
Frank.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.580
You're alive.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.170
I wasn't sure when you weren't
answering your phone.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.210
No, that's my fault.

19:07.210 --> 19:08.750
I've been monopolizing
her time.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.750
Eve Rothlo.
I'm an old friend.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.040
Emmett Crawford.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.790
He's my boss.

19:16.830 --> 19:19.330
Uh, well, I have
a few calls to make.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.670
Happy to see you're putting
your giant salary to good use.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.170
What's going on?

19:26.170 --> 19:29.040
I got served for a deposition
this morning.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.250
For what?
The misconduct
allegations.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.670
C&G wants me to admit
fault under oath.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.330
You can't do that.
Well,
that's why I'm here.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.040
If you're gonna actually
keep your promise

19:37.040 --> 19:38.710
and help me figure out
a way out of this --

19:38.710 --> 19:41.670
Of course I will.
Well, this is the time.

19:41.670 --> 19:43.500
I'll look over it.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.710
Thank you.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.620
Um, are you okay?

19:49.620 --> 19:50.880
Yeah.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.000
You know how it is having
company, so...

19:59.380 --> 20:01.420
What do you know
about Eve Rothlo?

20:01.420 --> 20:03.040
That she's one of the best

20:03.040 --> 20:04.620
death-penalty lawyers
in the country.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.620
Who'd you kill?

20:05.620 --> 20:08.040
I saw her at Annalise's
apartment.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.920
What?
It's weird, right?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.540
You being at Annalise's
apartment?

20:11.540 --> 20:12.790
Yes.

20:12.790 --> 20:15.920
Uh, just tell me if you think
she's up to something.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.170
Annalise is always up
to something.
Exactly.

20:18.170 --> 20:21.620
That doesn't mean
it's something bad...usually.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.960
Like maybe she's just trying
to recruit Rothlo

20:23.960 --> 20:25.330
to come work here?

20:25.330 --> 20:26.790
No, that's not what
I sensed was going on.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.880
Well, maybe you should recruit
her then and bring me.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.500
We can woo her together.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.580
Yeah. So you know nothing.
That's what you're telling me.

20:34.750 --> 20:35.920
Asher.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.040
What are you doing here?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.500
I need you to ask Miller

20:38.500 --> 20:40.290
for the transcripts
from Senior's inquest.

20:40.290 --> 20:42.380
Why?
So we can file
Nate's civil suit.

20:42.380 --> 20:44.040
Can you ask him?
No.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.000
Why am I the only one that cares
about this case anymore?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.380
I care, okay?
I...

20:47.380 --> 20:49.960
I just -- I can't
be asking him

20:49.960 --> 20:51.040
for special favors
like that.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.750
Fine. I'll ask Bonnie.

20:52.750 --> 20:53.830
Uh, you think she'll mind

20:53.830 --> 20:54.920
that you told us
she's screwing Miller?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.580
Michaela, don't do that.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.330
What is going on?

20:58.330 --> 21:00.080
Why did Bonnie want to see you?
Was it about Gabriel?

21:00.080 --> 21:01.620
It was a personal thing,
okay?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.580
Just stop worrying.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.210
Anything?
Not yet.

21:14.210 --> 21:17.580
Vivian Maddox is an enigma,
just like her son.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.380
-It's addictive, right?
-It's boring.

21:25.380 --> 21:28.380
He's studying for
our Admin Law Exam.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.210
You think he's playing us?

21:30.210 --> 21:33.120
We'd be stupid
not to think that.

21:35.750 --> 21:38.880
What should I say?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.960
When he's old enough
to ask me about his dad?

21:42.920 --> 21:45.460
Do I tell him nothing
like Gabriel's mom?

21:45.460 --> 21:49.080
Hope he never
finds out the truth?

21:49.080 --> 21:52.040
Or you tell him the truth,

21:52.040 --> 21:54.620
which is that his father
was a great guy

21:54.620 --> 21:56.920
who took the fall
for his friends.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.880
You believe that?

21:59.880 --> 22:03.710
If it hadn't been for Wes,
we'd all be in jail.

22:03.710 --> 22:06.210
Christopher would be
in foster care.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.000
Or my dad would have him.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.420
Exactly.

22:10.420 --> 22:13.420
Hey.

22:13.420 --> 22:17.710
Your father was a superhero,
which means you're a superhero.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.540
How cool is that?

22:41.710 --> 22:45.080
Dr. Groff: Officer Wagner
fired one shot at Mr. Lahey,

22:45.080 --> 22:47.580
striking his frontal skull.

22:57.420 --> 22:59.750
Hey. Wagner.

23:16.620 --> 23:20.120
Mr. Lahey,
thanks so much for waiting.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.330
You want to tell us
what that was all about?

23:26.330 --> 23:28.170
Frank: Look at your hands.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.960
You're gonna be the main suspect
the second

23:29.960 --> 23:31.120
Miller's identified
as missing.

23:32.790 --> 23:34.790
Just tell me why
I'm meeting with the FBI

23:34.790 --> 23:36.040
for beating a guy up.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.080
Not just a guy.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.420
The prison guard
who shot your father.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.000
A beat down seems like
a pretty easy way to get off.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.830
I agree.

23:44.830 --> 23:48.790
Mr. Lahey, are you aware that
D.A. Miller has gone missing?

23:48.790 --> 23:50.460
Since when?

23:50.460 --> 23:51.790
His last reported call
was to a colleague

23:51.790 --> 23:54.210
early Sunday morning.

23:54.210 --> 23:56.120
You don't seem surprised.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.670
Why?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.170
He ordered the inquest
on those guards.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.830
So you think those guards

24:01.830 --> 24:04.120
might have something to do
with his disappearance?

24:04.120 --> 24:06.330
Ain't it obvious?

24:06.330 --> 24:08.620
Or maybe you're trying
to put the blame

24:08.620 --> 24:11.540
on some people you're
obviously still very angry with.

24:11.540 --> 24:14.960
Someone ordered those guards
to kill my pops.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.540
Miller tried to find out who.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.460
Now you're telling me
the guy's missing.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.750
You really think
that's a coincidence?

24:25.170 --> 24:26.830
Is it Nate?

24:26.830 --> 24:28.120
That's who you're
staying here for?

24:28.120 --> 24:31.290
Let's not have
this conversation.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.710
If you're together again,
I support that.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.540
We're not.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.420
Because you're with
that man who showed up?

24:37.420 --> 24:38.790
My life is a mess
right now.

24:38.790 --> 24:40.420
I don't need a man
to make it worse.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.500
What about a woman?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
Is that what you think,

24:43.500 --> 24:45.540
that I need my own Vanessa?

24:45.540 --> 24:47.290
If you're open to that.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.210
We know a ton of sober ladies
in San Fran.

24:49.210 --> 24:52.210
You've never understood,
even now.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.330
Your privilege
lets you be gay.

24:54.330 --> 24:56.710
I'm black
from the damn Bible Belt.

24:56.710 --> 24:59.500
So stop trying to figure out
what's gonna make me happy.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.710
You don't know what that is,
I don't know what that is,

25:01.710 --> 25:05.040
but it isn't about finding
a person, a man or a woman.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.000
I have to figure it out.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.380
I have to save me.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.830
Is Annalise filing
a civil suit for Nate?

25:25.250 --> 25:27.120
I am, and what are you
doing here?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.790
She's out sick today.

25:28.790 --> 25:30.620
Came to talk to you,
actually.

25:30.620 --> 25:34.460
Nothing you could say to me
could get me to forgive you.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.420
Everything I said that night
was the truth.

25:36.420 --> 25:37.750
Of course it's true,

25:37.750 --> 25:39.750
because I am special
and beautiful

25:39.750 --> 25:41.000
and worthy of someone great.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.080
Clearly I now know
that that's not you.

25:43.080 --> 25:48.580
I know. I --
Which you played me like
some basic bitch sidepiece.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.380
No.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.000
Look, I only hid
who my father was from you

25:52.000 --> 25:53.960
so I could find out
what happened to him.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.880
And, honestly, I was kind of
hoping you'd understand.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.620
Well, you're an idiot
for hoping that.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.420
You're adopted, right?

25:59.420 --> 26:02.170
So I just thought maybe
out of everyone that

26:02.170 --> 26:04.330
you would get what it's like
to want to know

26:04.330 --> 26:06.000
about the parent
you never met.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.790
We're not the same.

26:11.790 --> 26:13.380
Leave so I can work.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.620
You've reached Nate Lahey.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.000
Leave a message.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.210
Nate, uh, it's Michaela again.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.750
Sorry to keep calling you.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.580
I just -- I want to run
something by you

26:35.580 --> 26:37.170
about your dad's case.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.750
Any leads?

26:42.750 --> 26:44.210
Not that I know of.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.500
You know, I was, um --
I was thinking.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.670
Wouldn't it -- Wouldn't it be
funny if he was just at home,

26:48.670 --> 26:51.330
sleeping this whole time,
and his -- his phone was dead?

26:51.330 --> 26:53.080
The police went
to his house.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.790
Yeah, I know.

26:55.790 --> 26:58.250
Uh, I just remember that one
time where he was yelling at you

26:58.250 --> 27:01.000
'cause his phone battery
kept dying.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.420
Did you ever, uh,
get him a new one?

27:04.420 --> 27:07.540
No. He wanted to wait
for the upgrade.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.290
Why?

27:09.290 --> 27:11.080
No reason.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.620
Um, but you know what?

27:14.620 --> 27:17.040
I think you should get him
that upgrade anyway.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.670
Like, that's how much
I believe he's coming back,

27:19.670 --> 27:23.500
that we just got to
keep the faith.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.330
God willing.

27:28.170 --> 27:30.120
Michaela:
I want to run something by you
about your dad's case.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.580
Don't worry. I'm not digging
into anything I shouldn't be.

27:32.580 --> 27:35.000
Just, can you call me back?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.750
Hey, did they bring you in?

27:36.750 --> 27:38.290
Yeah, we'll talk later.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.790
BonBon. We need to talk.

27:42.790 --> 27:45.080
Not now.
It's important.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.170
Miller's cellphone battery
was busted.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.790
What?
His phone kept dying.
Peggy confirmed it.

27:49.790 --> 27:52.420
So what if that's why he was on
the payphone -- not to be shady,

27:52.420 --> 27:54.420
but because his phone
was actually dead?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.670
There's no other reason he'd
have called the Warden that day.

27:56.670 --> 27:59.040
We have no proof that the call
was even about Nate's dad.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.250
Asher --
What if Nate is wrong?

28:01.250 --> 28:02.710
That's all I'm asking.

28:02.710 --> 28:05.170
You don't want to believe
he was a bad guy.

28:05.170 --> 28:06.290
I don't want to believe it,
either.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.670
But we were wrong about him,
especially me,

28:08.670 --> 28:11.420
so stop making me feel worse
than I already do.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.830
Ms. Price,
do you have a minute?
No.

28:19.830 --> 28:24.040
What if I told you I know how to
make the board love you again?

28:26.710 --> 28:28.750
You should file a civil suit
against the state

28:28.750 --> 28:31.250
on behalf
of Nate Lahey Junior.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.960
If you win, you'd attract
a ton of good press

28:32.960 --> 28:34.380
that C&G desperately needs.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.750
Why wouldn't you
bring this to Annalise?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.960
You're the civil-suit expert,

28:37.960 --> 28:41.620
and you need this win
more than she does.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.380
Okay, but have you talked
to Nate Junior about this?

28:44.380 --> 28:46.580
I wanted to get you
on board first.

28:46.580 --> 28:48.290
You mean you want to
waste my time on a case

28:48.290 --> 28:49.830
without an actual plaintiff?

28:49.830 --> 28:51.580
We lost the inquest.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.040
No one is going to jail
for murdering that man.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.380
Justice will not be served.

28:54.380 --> 28:55.750
But you know what
still can be served?

28:55.750 --> 28:56.920
Money.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.710
Let me think about it.

29:01.710 --> 29:03.120
Great.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.250
Michaela?

29:07.250 --> 29:10.880
Any idea why Annalise would
be meeting with Eve Rothlo?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.170
Eve's here?

29:12.170 --> 29:13.710
So you know about
the two of them?

29:13.710 --> 29:16.500
No, I-I-I mean, I know that
they were at Harvard together.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.080
But were they together
at Harvard?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.580
You mean before Sam?

29:20.580 --> 29:23.040
Bisexuality is real,
Ms. Pratt.
I know that.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.210
I have personal experience
with the matter.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.580
Really?

29:28.580 --> 29:30.420
My fiancé --

29:30.420 --> 29:34.080
ex-fiancé,
he was bisexual.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.120
Interesting.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.960
Seth?
You have a minute?

31:04.960 --> 31:08.580
Yeah.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.830
This is all crazy, huh?

31:15.830 --> 31:18.000
I'm still in shock.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
With Denver, I kept thinking
it all had to be a mistake.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.830
I'm sorry.

31:27.830 --> 31:30.750
No.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.120
It's rough for everyone.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.880
There's something
you don't know.

31:36.710 --> 31:40.250
Ron and I were together.

31:40.250 --> 31:43.120
No one really knew,
and I don't want them to.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.920
It's just...

31:45.920 --> 31:47.880
I don't want
to cause trouble.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.460
For who?

31:50.460 --> 31:54.040
I heard Ron on a phone call
with Warden Sykes.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.960
They were arguing.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.880
You think Sykes
is behind this?

31:58.880 --> 32:01.330
I don't know.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.170
I just don't want to
raise it with the FBI

32:03.170 --> 32:06.080
if I'm being paranoid.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.000
And I know that you are
monitoring the prison

32:10.000 --> 32:11.330
for your corruption case...

32:11.330 --> 32:12.620
You know I can't
talk about that.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.540
Ron told me you have
a wiretap on Sykes --

32:14.540 --> 32:15.960
Bonnie.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.620
I just want to listen
to that one call.

32:19.620 --> 32:21.210
Here's the date.

32:21.210 --> 32:22.830
Please.

32:22.830 --> 32:25.000
At least so I can stop
thinking that Sykes

32:25.000 --> 32:26.540
had something to
do with this.

32:33.290 --> 32:35.000
Frank: Vivian's been clean
a few years.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.210
It helps she works part-time
at a rehab center.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.460
But then I found this.
Who is he?

32:39.460 --> 32:42.710
Vivian's boyfriend
until he O.D.'d on oxy.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.750
It could work, right?

32:43.750 --> 32:45.170
Make Gabe think Mommy
could be charged

32:45.170 --> 32:46.250
with drug possession,
dealing --

32:46.250 --> 32:48.330
No.
He needs to be scared.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.210
She has a better idea,
Frank.

32:50.210 --> 32:53.210
Section 401 of the Illinois
Controlled Substance Act.

32:53.210 --> 32:56.120
You think it can work?
I think you
can make it work.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.330
We'll need proof that Vivian
supplied the oxy.

32:58.330 --> 33:00.290
Easy. Frank bribes
someone to

33:00.290 --> 33:01.290
say Vivian
was their dealer.

33:01.290 --> 33:02.960
So now we're lying
to Gabriel

33:02.960 --> 33:05.250
as well as bribing
drug addicts, too?

33:05.250 --> 33:08.330
Sorry, what am I doing?
They won't have to testify,
just sign a statement.

33:08.330 --> 33:10.250
Gabriel's too smart
to fall for that.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.580
He's just a law student.
He'll cave.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.120
Or it makes me look guilty.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.750
He loves his mother,
right?

33:15.750 --> 33:17.710
Use that --
not to scare him,

33:17.710 --> 33:19.580
but to convince him
to protect her.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.880
Hey.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.580
Let's talk.

33:32.750 --> 33:34.420
Look inside.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.960
Who is he?

33:44.960 --> 33:46.580
Your mother's ex.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.920
She was with him when
you were an undergrad.

33:48.920 --> 33:52.040
Kept it under wraps because
they were using drugs together.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.500
Her drugs.

33:55.790 --> 33:57.420
So this is a threat --

33:57.420 --> 33:59.120
I keep my mouth shut
about Sam,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.380
otherwise you, what, you get
my mom charged with murder?

34:01.380 --> 34:02.380
That's not what I'm saying.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.750
Then tell me
what the hell this is.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.540
I could've easily taken
this to the police

34:05.540 --> 34:07.500
if I wanted to hurt
you or her.

34:07.500 --> 34:10.040
Instead, here I am,
giving it to you.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.210
Why?

34:12.210 --> 34:13.880
Because I want to help you.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.540
Because you feel guilty.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.500
Yeah.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.880
Because it wasn't just Sam.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.880
It was me
who hurt her, too.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.880
And maybe that's what
made her turn to drugs.

34:23.170 --> 34:25.830
And if I can find this out
in a day, imagine what else

34:25.830 --> 34:28.120
someone else could find if they
really wanted her to suffer.

34:30.210 --> 34:33.500
We both want to protect her,
Gabriel.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.540
So just help me to do that.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.000
They get their money's worth
with us single people,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.210
don't they?

34:49.210 --> 34:50.960
Hmm. What's up?

34:50.960 --> 34:53.670
A potential new case.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.960
This is Annalise's client.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.330
She's too busy to
handle a civil suit.

35:00.330 --> 35:02.120
You okay with me
suing the state?

35:03.380 --> 35:04.960
Let me read it over.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.580
Oh, and I got some scoop on why
Eve Rothlo could be here...

35:08.580 --> 35:09.580
if you're interested.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.380
Mm. Go ahead.

35:11.380 --> 35:12.830
They're ex-girlfriends.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.580
What?

35:14.580 --> 35:17.540
It was, apparently, just
a law-school thing for Annalise.

35:17.540 --> 35:20.830
Meaning, you know, don't worry,
you still got a chance.

35:20.830 --> 35:23.710
Projecting much?

35:23.710 --> 35:26.380
What?
I think you meant to say
that you still have a chance.

35:26.380 --> 35:30.580
What? No!
Sir, come --

35:30.580 --> 35:33.920
Oh. Oh, you think
you're funny.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.290
Good night, Ms. Price.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.710
I'm just a plane ride away.

36:01.710 --> 36:04.920
So, uh, call me
if Gabriel acts up

36:04.920 --> 36:07.170
or you need my help
with the Governor.

36:07.170 --> 36:09.330
I can handle it.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.210
I just need an excuse
to visit.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.880
I can come to you
after the baby.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.170
If there's a baby.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.080
Oh, there's gonna be.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.830
My point is --
come sooner.

36:18.830 --> 36:20.880
Not to introduce you
to our hot friends.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.880
I don't want "hot."
I want nice.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.080
They can be both.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.790
Just keep your eyes open.
That's all.

37:16.420 --> 37:17.880
Agent Telesco:
Mr. Maddox.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.170
This is Agent Telesco
with the FBI.

37:20.170 --> 37:22.290
We have a few questions
about a voicemail

37:22.290 --> 37:24.500

D.A. Ronald Miller.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.120
I screwed up.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.380
They found out who I am.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.250
Can you call me back?

37:30.250 --> 37:31.670
Please call us back
as soon as possible

37:31.670 --> 37:33.790

It's Janelle from
the Department of Corrections.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.540
D.A. Miller's disappearance
is of particular concern

39:15.540 --> 39:17.960
considering the fact
that his predecessor,

39:17.960 --> 39:19.290
District Attorney Todd Denver,

39:19.290 --> 39:21.500
was murdered less
than a year ago.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.830
Currently serving time
for his murder

39:23.830 --> 39:28.120
is former Antares Technologies'
CEO Jorge Castillo.

The FBI declined to comment...
Did your father do this?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.960
...on if they believe there
may be a connection...
I don't know.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.580
...between D.A. Miller's
disappearance and Castillo.
Probably.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.830
It wasn't your dad.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.580

Bonnie needed

39:43.380 --> 39:45.120

at the office --

39:45.120 --> 39:48.000
That doesn't mean anything.
She had blood on her leg
at the wedding.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.170

Did she do something to him?

39:50.170 --> 39:52.540

40:24.460 --> 40:29.920
saying I was wrong,
and I lost it.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.170

41:04.500 --> 41:06.080
No.

who killed Miller.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
She got Miller to help her
take out my pops,

41:20.380 --> 41:23.920
then she took him out
to keep him from squealing.

41:27.790 --> 41:29.210
It's a good plan.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.790
Hi, Warden. This is Marissa.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.290

Jeff, hey. Ron Miller here.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.500
Oh. I didn't recognize
the number.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.250
Yeah, my phone died.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.460
Uh, listen, I'm calling
to thank you

41:48.460 --> 41:50.960
for handling the
Nate Lahey Senior transfer.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.920
It's not a problem.
Well, still, I just
wanted to say thanks.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.880

he's a good guy,

41:55.880 --> 41:58.120

transfer as easy as possible

41:58.120 --> 42:00.710

Yeah, we'll take good care
of him. No problem.

42:00.710 --> 42:01.920
