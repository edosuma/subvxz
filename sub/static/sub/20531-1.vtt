GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Many governments all of a sudden

00:04.670 --> 00:08.590
are now involved in the search
for extraterrestrial life.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.420
You have to wonder why.

00:10.420 --> 00:13.970
NICK REDFERN:
Between 1948 and 1969,

00:13.970 --> 00:18.510
the U. S. Air Force
collected 12,618

00:18.510 --> 00:20.060
UFO reports.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.350
MIKE BARA:
It was actually required

00:22.350 --> 00:24.350
that all officers fill out
a form if they saw anything

00:24.350 --> 00:26.060
that might be regarded
as a flying saucer.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.230
And they were told not
to discuss their sighting

00:28.230 --> 00:29.650
with anyone.

00:29.650 --> 00:32.110
WILLIAM HENRY:
We have to be open

00:32.110 --> 00:35.570
to the possibility that the U. S.
government is absolutely aware

00:35.570 --> 00:38.030
of extraterrestrial involvement
in human affairs.

00:38.030 --> 00:41.450
NARRATOR:
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:41.450 --> 00:45.420
mankind has credited
its origins to gods

00:45.420 --> 00:48.170
and other visitors
from the stars.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.750
What if it were true?

00:50.750 --> 00:53.380
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:53.380 --> 00:56.840
really help
to shape our history?

00:56.840 --> 01:02.720
And if so, could the truth be
exposed by the alien hunters?

01:35.090 --> 01:36.510
NARRATOR:
London, England.

01:36.510 --> 01:40.350
July 20, 2015.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.890
A consortium of the world's
leading scientists,

01:43.890 --> 01:47.850
including theoretical physicist
Stephen Hawking

01:47.850 --> 01:50.060
and SETI founder Frank Drake,

01:50.060 --> 01:53.780
gather at London's Royal Society

01:53.780 --> 01:57.490
as Russian billionaire and
technology tycoon Yuri Milner

01:57.490 --> 02:02.740
announces his ambitious
initiative: Breakthrough Listen.

02:02.740 --> 02:07.040
The scope of our search
will be unprecedented.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.920
NARRATOR: The project is
a ten‐year, $100 million search

02:11.920 --> 02:14.420
for intelligent
extraterrestrial life

02:14.420 --> 02:18.180
that is widely regarded
as the most comprehensive search

02:18.180 --> 02:21.760
for alien communications
in recorded history.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.770
The endowment will fund
thousands of hours yearly

02:25.770 --> 02:29.520
on radio telescopes
in North America and Australia,

02:29.520 --> 02:32.810
as well as data processing
to look for

02:32.810 --> 02:36.780
radio signals
in distant solar systems.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.950
This Breakthrough Listen Project

02:38.950 --> 02:41.240
is revolutionary
because not only

02:41.240 --> 02:44.030
are they going to survey
a very long list of stars,

02:44.030 --> 02:46.450
they're going to survey
ten times more area

02:46.450 --> 02:48.500
overall compared
to previous surveys.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.750
I think there's definitely been
a turning point

02:52.750 --> 02:54.460
regarding the overall consensus

02:54.460 --> 02:56.880
about the possibility
of extraterrestrial life.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.720
Now that we're able to document

02:59.720 --> 03:03.510
and scientifically see
out in the universe

03:03.510 --> 03:05.890
the possibility of planets
that could sustain life,

03:05.890 --> 03:08.680
it also allows us the
opportunity to know the odds

03:08.680 --> 03:11.650
that there is life out there
is undoubtable.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.980
NARRATOR: Breakthrough Listen
marks the first time

03:17.980 --> 03:21.610
that mainstream scientists
have launched a major project

03:21.610 --> 03:23.410
with the explicit purpose

03:23.410 --> 03:26.870
of finding intelligent
extraterrestrial life.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.830
During the announcement,
Stephen Hawking stated...

03:43.430 --> 03:46.390
While this new initiative
is monumental,

03:46.390 --> 03:49.520
the hunt for the existence
of life beyond Earth

03:49.520 --> 03:52.100
has persisted for many decades.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.520
Starting around 1947,

03:55.520 --> 03:59.030
a series of events forced
certain high‐level members

03:59.030 --> 04:00.860
within the United States
government

04:00.860 --> 04:04.660
to officially become
alien hunters.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.780
When you look at the year 1947,

04:07.780 --> 04:11.410
the statistics are that
there were at least 800 reports

04:11.410 --> 04:14.500
to police and airports
of people saying

04:14.500 --> 04:16.420
that they were seeing something
in the sky,

04:16.420 --> 04:17.880
they didn't know what it was.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.010
And probably the most important,

04:21.010 --> 04:23.470
and the one
that made worldwide headlines

04:23.470 --> 04:27.850
was near Mt. Rainier,
Washington.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.100
On June 24, 1947,
a businessman and pilot

04:32.100 --> 04:34.810
named Kenneth Arnold
was flying near Mt. Rainier

04:34.810 --> 04:36.560
in Washington state.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.480
As he was flying
around the mountain,

04:38.480 --> 04:40.360
he suddenly caught sight

04:40.360 --> 04:43.030
of a squadron
of strange‐looking objects.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.360
He could not figure out
what they were.

04:47.570 --> 04:49.620
JAN C. HARZAN:
He was able to time them

04:49.620 --> 04:51.080
as they went
between two mountain peaks,

04:51.080 --> 04:52.700
which he knew
the exact distance of,

04:52.700 --> 04:55.170
and calculated their speed
at between 1,200

04:55.170 --> 04:58.290
and 1,700 miles an hour.

04:58.290 --> 05:00.000
Well, in that day,
we didn't have aircraft

05:00.000 --> 05:02.800
that could go faster than about
500 or 600 miles an hour,

05:02.800 --> 05:06.590
so this was definitely something
not of terrestrial origin.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.890
REDFERN:
He later described the objects

05:09.890 --> 05:12.140
as being somewhat delta shaped

05:12.140 --> 05:15.100
and flying
as if you were to skip a saucer

05:15.100 --> 05:16.560
across a body of water.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.310
And this gave rise to the term

05:19.310 --> 05:22.110
"flying saucer."

05:22.110 --> 05:24.950
HARZAN: Within days of Arnold's
report being published,

05:24.950 --> 05:27.240
there were literally
20 other reports

05:27.240 --> 05:29.160
of‐of similar objects seen

05:29.160 --> 05:32.200
in the sky around the northwest
of the United States.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.950
This opened the floodgates

05:33.950 --> 05:36.620
for literally hundreds
of reports to pour in.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.960
NARRATOR: Just two weeks after
this flurry of UFO sightings,

05:43.960 --> 05:46.760
the infamous
Roswell Incident occurred.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.220
But it was actually a sighting
that happened a day earlier

05:53.220 --> 05:56.180
that thrust military officials
into the hunt.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.110
On July 7, 1947,
at Edwards Air Force Base,

06:02.110 --> 06:04.400
then called Muroc Air Base,

06:04.400 --> 06:09.320
Major J. C. Wise was sitting
in his XP‐84 fighter jet,

06:09.320 --> 06:11.620
experimental aircraft,

06:11.620 --> 06:13.540
when he noticed
that people on the ground

06:13.540 --> 06:16.000
were watching an object
off in the distance.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.250
He looked and saw a bright,
spinning, yellow object

06:19.250 --> 06:21.630
about 10,000 feet in the air

06:21.630 --> 06:24.710
that was a ball of about
five to ten feet in diameter.

06:26.630 --> 06:28.680
After the sighting,
it was actually required

06:28.680 --> 06:31.550
that all officers fill out
a form if they saw anything

06:31.550 --> 06:33.680
that might be regarded
as a UFO or a flying saucer.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.310
And in addition to that,

06:35.310 --> 06:37.980
they were told not to discuss
their sighting

06:37.980 --> 06:41.610
or what was on their report
with anyone.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.900
In the wake of the incredible
number of UFO reports

06:44.900 --> 06:48.360
that reached the military
in the summer of 1947,

06:48.360 --> 06:52.370
Lieutenant General
Nathan Twining at Wright Field

06:52.370 --> 06:54.450
created a new order

06:54.450 --> 06:58.500
to ensure that all UFO reports
reached the military.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
This led to the creation

07:00.500 --> 07:03.790
of the first official
UFO research program

07:03.790 --> 07:06.420
on the part of the military
known as Project Sign.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.390
NARRATOR:
On January 22, 1948,

07:13.390 --> 07:17.100
the U. S. government authorized
its first official study

07:17.100 --> 07:19.850
of the UFO phenomenon.

07:19.850 --> 07:25.940
The highly classified agenda
was known as Project Sign.

07:25.940 --> 07:28.940
WILLIAM HENRY:
Project Sign officially argued

07:28.940 --> 07:31.740
that these UFO sightings
were authentic

07:31.740 --> 07:33.700
and hinted
that they were, in fact,

07:33.700 --> 07:36.280
extraterrestrial in nature.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.790
But the higher‐ups
in the military stepped in

07:38.790 --> 07:42.170
and redacted those statements,
canceled Project Sign,

07:42.170 --> 07:44.380
turned it into Project Grudge,

07:44.380 --> 07:46.800
which ultimately became
Project Blue Book.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.760
REDFERN: The Air Force
closed down Blue Book

07:50.760 --> 07:53.640
because essentially they said
they didn't find any evidence

07:53.640 --> 07:55.430
that UFOs were real

07:55.430 --> 07:58.470
or represented a threat
to national security.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.350
Between 1948 and 1969,

08:04.350 --> 08:09.860
the U. S. Air Force
collected 12,618 UFO reports.

08:09.860 --> 08:13.740
Of that number,
701 remained unexplained.

08:16.950 --> 08:19.870
NARRATOR: While the Air Force's
official stance was

08:19.870 --> 08:22.960
that Project Blue Book produced
no compelling evidence

08:22.960 --> 08:27.090
that extraterrestrial craft
occupied Earth's airspace,

08:27.090 --> 08:31.340
one important contributor
to the study strongly disagreed.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.800
Dr. J. Allen Hynek,

08:35.800 --> 08:38.760
a professor in the Department
of Physics and Astronomy

08:38.760 --> 08:40.970
at Ohio State University,

08:40.970 --> 08:45.690
was appointed as scientific
advisor for UFO studies

08:45.690 --> 08:49.360
during Projects Sign,
Grudge and Blue Book.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.860
HARZAN:
Dr. Hynek was a pure skeptic

08:52.860 --> 08:54.610
at the very beginning
of his career

08:54.610 --> 08:57.490
as a consultant
to the United States Air Force.

08:57.490 --> 09:01.200
In fact, he considered these
UFOs to be utterly ridiculous.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.290
But as he got
more and more involved

09:03.290 --> 09:07.130
and began talking to
more and more quality witnesses,

09:07.130 --> 09:09.340
like military fighter pilots,

09:09.340 --> 09:11.590
it became clear to him
that there really was

09:11.590 --> 09:14.340
something to
this whole UFO question.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.680
When asked in his later years
what turned him around

09:17.680 --> 09:22.310
on the whole UFO question,
Dr. Hynek said two things.

09:22.310 --> 09:25.230
The first is that
the Air Force was dead set

09:25.230 --> 09:28.350
on putting an answer
on every single UFO report,

09:28.350 --> 09:31.480
even if they had
to force the answer.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.320
The second is
that he started talking

09:34.320 --> 09:36.650
to very, very credible witnesses

09:36.650 --> 09:38.530
that led him to believe
that these objects

09:38.530 --> 09:40.990
were, in fact, real.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.750
NARRATOR: In the intervening
years, UFO investigators

09:47.750 --> 09:49.920
and scholars have attempted

09:49.920 --> 09:52.840
to access Project Blue Book
case files

09:52.840 --> 09:56.170
utilizing
the Freedom of Information Act.

09:56.170 --> 10:00.890
But the names, details
and other personal information

10:00.890 --> 10:04.520
of all the witnesses and
sightings have been blacked out

10:04.520 --> 10:09.150
from the documents, preventing
any further examination.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.690
HENRY: Considering the way
the U. S. government

10:11.690 --> 10:15.690
has labeled UFOs "top secret,"
we have to at least be open

10:15.690 --> 10:17.530
to the possibility
that higher‐ups

10:17.530 --> 10:19.110
within the U. S. government,

10:19.110 --> 10:20.950
or even those higher
than U. S. government,

10:20.950 --> 10:22.620
are absolutely aware

10:22.620 --> 10:25.120
of extraterrestrial involvement
in human affairs

10:25.120 --> 10:26.830
and have sought
to cover up this phenomena

10:26.830 --> 10:28.790
for the past six decades.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.750
NARRATOR: Considering
the top‐secret nature

10:32.750 --> 10:35.760
of these projects,
is it possible that

10:35.760 --> 10:39.430
the incredible claims
of Dr. J. Allen Hynek are true,

10:39.430 --> 10:43.220
and that actual contact
with extraterrestrial craft

10:43.220 --> 10:46.640
has been concealed
from the general population?

10:48.980 --> 10:52.860
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and claim

10:52.860 --> 10:55.860
that mankind
has had contact with aliens

10:55.860 --> 10:58.860
since our earliest
civilizations.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.040
NARRATOR:
Humboldt University.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.370
Berlin, Germany.

11:08.370 --> 11:12.420
January 28, 2016.

11:12.420 --> 11:16.420
Astroarchaeologist
Mathieu Ossendrijver

11:16.420 --> 11:20.800
announces what he calls
"a truly astonishing find."

11:22.890 --> 11:25.720
He has discovered evidence
that astronomers living

11:25.720 --> 11:28.060
in the ancient city of Babylon

11:28.060 --> 11:30.980
invented sophisticated
mathematical equations

11:30.980 --> 11:35.690
to track the movement of Jupiter
some 2,000 years ago.

11:40.110 --> 11:42.490
When modern astronomers think
about the timing of events

11:42.490 --> 11:45.530
in the solar system, we use very
complicated computer programs

11:45.530 --> 11:47.450
that take into account things
like special relativity

11:47.450 --> 11:49.370
and general relativity.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.710
We didn't think that ancient
astronomers would have had

11:52.710 --> 11:55.420
the capacity to make the same
calculations we do today.

11:55.420 --> 11:58.500
We knew that the Babylonians
were able to predict

11:58.500 --> 12:01.130
when Venus would appear and
which constellations would be up

12:01.130 --> 12:03.680
at certain times of the year,
but we never would have expected

12:03.680 --> 12:06.300
that they were using one of
the precursors to calculus

12:06.300 --> 12:09.140
to figure out the motions
of Jupiter in the sky.

12:09.140 --> 12:12.140
When the Babylonians looked
where Jupiter was in the sky,

12:12.140 --> 12:14.020
they would record
where it was one night,

12:14.020 --> 12:16.020
and they would draw a point
on a graph.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.110
They would record the time
on the bottom axis

12:18.110 --> 12:19.820
and the position
on the top axis.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.610
They'd do this the next night.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.400
They'd see Jupiter
was over here.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.780
And then the next night,
it's over there and over there.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.160
And they could then draw
a corner down to the time axis,

12:30.160 --> 12:31.620
and then they'd draw a line.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.670
So you end up
with a trapezoid in space.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.880
NARRATOR: How did the ancient
Babylonians understand

12:39.880 --> 12:43.300
mathematical concepts that were
thought to have been developed

12:43.300 --> 12:46.970
by Isaac Newton
in the 17th century?

12:46.970 --> 12:50.140
And why were they
mysteriously concerned

12:50.140 --> 12:52.850
with the precise movements
of Jupiter,

12:52.850 --> 12:55.060
a planet that they associated

12:55.060 --> 12:58.230
with one of
their most important gods,

12:58.230 --> 13:00.110
Marduk?

13:02.820 --> 13:07.410
The principal deity
of ancient Babylon was Marduk,

13:07.410 --> 13:10.030
and he was associated
with the planet Jupiter.

13:10.030 --> 13:13.580
And there was a large mythology

13:13.580 --> 13:16.210
around his departure
and eventual return.

13:16.210 --> 13:19.170
They were very interested
in the return of their divinity,

13:19.170 --> 13:22.090
so any sign that
the planet Jupiter would give

13:22.090 --> 13:24.090
would be of great interest.

13:24.090 --> 13:27.140
DAVID WHITEHEAD: Why was Jupiter
so important to this culture

13:27.140 --> 13:29.220
that they actually conscribed it

13:29.220 --> 13:32.140
as being one of their gods
called Marduk?

13:32.140 --> 13:35.060
Was it that they believed that
Marduk came from this planet

13:35.060 --> 13:37.900
and would eventually return
one day?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.230
Are they recounting
an extraterrestrial visitation

13:40.230 --> 13:41.820
from the past?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.360
And were they given
this advanced knowledge

13:43.360 --> 13:44.940
as a way of knowing

13:44.940 --> 13:47.240
of when
this extraterrestrial being

13:47.240 --> 13:49.700
would one day return?

13:49.700 --> 13:52.290
It's quite compelling
that many ancient cultures

13:52.290 --> 13:55.750
went to great lengths
to track these celestial bodies.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.420
NARRATOR: Much like
the Breakthrough Listen project

14:01.420 --> 14:04.840
of today, many ancient cultures
took great measures

14:04.840 --> 14:08.130
to study the heavens.

14:08.130 --> 14:12.140
All over the planet,
there are stone observatories.

14:12.140 --> 14:15.310
These are systems of stones
arranged to line up

14:15.310 --> 14:17.690
with the planets
in celestial moments,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.310
suggesting
that the ancients were

14:20.310 --> 14:22.980
really quite advanced
in their study of the stars

14:22.980 --> 14:26.030
to use these and use them well.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.530
We are fascinated,
our current scientists,

14:29.530 --> 14:32.490
in the accuracy in the alignment
that they have arranged

14:32.490 --> 14:35.290
and how they are so similar,
these observatories,

14:35.290 --> 14:38.120
these configurations
all over the planet.

14:40.370 --> 14:42.590
It would be one thing
if we found

14:42.590 --> 14:45.920
one ancient megalithic
stone observatory.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.090
But the fact is
that there are at least ten

14:50.090 --> 14:52.010
all around the world
that were fashioned

14:52.010 --> 14:55.770
in megalithic structures.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.100
The most popular one
is Stonehenge.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.900
Stone observatories,

15:01.900 --> 15:05.570
oftentimes not only do
they track the stars

15:05.570 --> 15:09.530
but sometimes they track
specific constellations.

15:12.030 --> 15:18.120
First and foremost, Orion,
Sirius and the Pleiades.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.670
So I have to ask
the question why.

15:21.670 --> 15:26.380
Because in association
with those observatories,

15:26.380 --> 15:28.130
we have stories

15:28.130 --> 15:30.720
of beings arriving
from the Pleiades,

15:30.720 --> 15:32.970
from Sirius and Orion,

15:32.970 --> 15:36.970
imparting knowledge
to our ancestors.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.270
This whole idea
of observing the stars

15:40.270 --> 15:45.110
is something
that is innate in our soul.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.070
All of our ancient cultures
were visited

15:48.070 --> 15:51.070
by the same type
of extraterrestrials.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.740
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Babylonians,

15:56.740 --> 16:00.290
as well as
other ancient civilizations,

16:00.290 --> 16:04.460
were watching the stars for
signs of extraterrestrial life?

16:04.460 --> 16:07.040
And if so, were they watching

16:07.040 --> 16:11.840
because contact
had already been made?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.800
Why were they obsessed
with tracking

16:13.800 --> 16:16.220
the movements of stars
and planets?

16:16.220 --> 16:19.140
Was it just for orientation,
so they could know

16:19.140 --> 16:21.270
what direction they're traveling
when they're navigating

16:21.270 --> 16:23.140
on ships?

16:23.140 --> 16:26.650
Or could it be
that they were actually visited

16:26.650 --> 16:30.280
by beings
that came from these planets?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.280
I think absolutely yes.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.330
NARRATOR: Could
our ancestors' near obsession

16:37.330 --> 16:40.580
with the movement of the stars
be proof that they were

16:40.580 --> 16:44.500
in fact the first alien hunters?

16:44.500 --> 16:49.840
If so, could it lead to proof
of extraterrestrial contact

16:49.840 --> 16:52.470
hundreds or even thousands
of years ago?

16:54.380 --> 16:57.010
And might these ancient
stone observatories

16:57.010 --> 17:02.310
be leading today's alien hunters
towards the next big discovery?

17:10.020 --> 17:11.820
NARRATOR:
Barron, Wisconsin.

17:11.820 --> 17:15.860
Summer 1934.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.370
At the age of nine,

17:18.370 --> 17:21.490
Coral Lorenzen spots
a saucer‐shaped object

17:21.490 --> 17:24.040
floating across the sky.

17:24.040 --> 17:28.000
It makes no sound
as it moves slowly northwest,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.050
before disappearing
over the horizon.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.930
The encounter lasts
just 20 seconds

17:36.930 --> 17:38.970
but will forever change
the course

17:38.970 --> 17:43.020
of UFO investigations.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.640
One of the early important
UFO researchers

17:46.640 --> 17:49.690
in the United States
is Coral Lorenzen.

17:49.690 --> 17:53.780
She had a UFO sighting long
before the flying saucer wave

17:53.780 --> 17:55.820
of the '40s took place.

17:55.820 --> 17:58.240
And it stayed with her
her whole life.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.160
HARZAN:
In August of 1951,

18:01.160 --> 18:04.120
Coral took on a role
of being a reporter

18:04.120 --> 18:07.040
for the <i>Green Bay Press‐Gazette</i>

18:07.040 --> 18:09.670
and wrote stories about UFOs.

18:09.670 --> 18:11.880
She got lots of responses
from other people

18:11.880 --> 18:13.590
who had seen similar objects.

18:16.090 --> 18:18.340
NARRATOR:
In 1952,

18:18.340 --> 18:20.260
Coral and her husband,

18:20.260 --> 18:22.810
a former U. S. Army
Air Corps officer,

18:22.810 --> 18:24.640
Jim Lorenzen,

18:24.640 --> 18:28.560
established the first
independent UFO organization,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.440
known as Aerial Phenomena
Research Organization,

18:32.440 --> 18:35.690
or APRO.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.490
Coral was highly disappointed
with how the Air Force

18:38.490 --> 18:41.410
and the government was handling
this whole UFO question.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.990
She knew
that these craft were real.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.370
She felt there needed to be
an investigative body

18:47.370 --> 18:49.080
not beholden to the government

18:49.080 --> 18:52.080
that could look
into this question.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.050
The Lorenzens decided
the best way

18:55.050 --> 18:57.130
to investigate the phenomenon

18:57.130 --> 18:59.970
was essentially to set up
an investigative group

18:59.970 --> 19:02.010
with people in different
disciplines and fields

19:02.010 --> 19:04.390
who could look at reports,
study them,

19:04.390 --> 19:07.810
and determine
what the witnesses had seen.

19:07.810 --> 19:10.270
At the height of its success,

19:10.270 --> 19:13.650
APRO actually had
more than 3,000 members,

19:13.650 --> 19:15.820
many of whom
were out in the field

19:15.820 --> 19:19.200
investigating things,
compiling reports,

19:19.200 --> 19:22.240
and really putting together
a huge body

19:22.240 --> 19:24.530
of highly credible data,

19:24.530 --> 19:27.950
which far exceeded anything,
really,

19:27.950 --> 19:30.000
that Blue Book, Sign
and Grudge were doing.

19:32.250 --> 19:35.170
This was the first
civilian organization

19:35.170 --> 19:37.550
to go and investigate UFOs.

19:37.550 --> 19:40.130
And once she broke the ice
on this,

19:40.130 --> 19:45.100
other organizations
began coming and being created.

19:45.100 --> 19:49.890
One of those organizations
was called NICAP.

19:49.890 --> 19:54.110
Admiral Fahrney, who was
at the time in World War Two

19:54.110 --> 19:58.530
considered the guided missile
scientist of the Navy,

19:58.530 --> 20:02.450
helped found and
became the chairman of NICAP.

20:02.450 --> 20:05.240
Even more interesting,
the other member of NICAP

20:05.240 --> 20:08.200
was the first head of the CIA,

20:08.200 --> 20:11.160
Admiral Hillenkoetter.

20:11.160 --> 20:15.880
If there was anyone who should
know if UFOs were real or not,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.170
you would think
it would be the head

20:18.170 --> 20:20.970
of the Central Intelligence
Agency.

20:20.970 --> 20:26.890
In 1960, Rear Admiral
Hillenkoetter stated

20:26.890 --> 20:28.930
the following three things:

20:28.930 --> 20:33.020
one, that the UFO phenomenon
was real;

20:33.020 --> 20:35.810
two, that it was not Soviet;

20:35.810 --> 20:40.070
and, three, that we had not
adequately studied

20:40.070 --> 20:43.490
scientifically
the UFO phenomenon.

20:47.450 --> 20:50.240
NARRATOR:
A former director of the CIA

20:50.240 --> 20:55.040
admitting that
the UFO phenomenon is real?

20:55.040 --> 20:58.170
Might Admiral Hillenkoetter
have come across

20:58.170 --> 21:02.470
definitive evidence
of alien craft visiting Earth?

21:02.470 --> 21:04.680
Despite his audacious statement,

21:04.680 --> 21:07.180
the government maintained
its position

21:07.180 --> 21:11.060
that no UFO reports
had proved credible.

21:11.060 --> 21:15.810
But the number of public
UFO societies continued to grow.

21:19.230 --> 21:22.530
On May 31, 1969,

21:22.530 --> 21:25.530
APRO member Walt Andrus created

21:25.530 --> 21:28.120
his own volunteer‐based
organization

21:28.120 --> 21:32.700
that combined Missouri,
Iowa and Illinois.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.620
What started
as the Midwest UFO Network

21:35.620 --> 21:39.710
would ultimately change its name
to the Mutual UFO Network,

21:39.710 --> 21:42.460
or MUFON, when it grew to become

21:42.460 --> 21:46.340
the largest UFO investigation
organization in the world.

21:48.590 --> 21:52.430
POPE: MUFON now has
thousands of members.

21:52.430 --> 21:56.520
They have state directors
and field investigators

21:56.520 --> 21:58.650
covering the entire
United States,

21:58.650 --> 22:01.610
and indeed a number
of other countries, too.

22:01.610 --> 22:07.110
And unlike the way in which
things were done in APRO days,

22:07.110 --> 22:11.870
MUFON's model involves giving
a lot of autonomy to the states.

22:11.870 --> 22:13.790
They organize
their own conferences.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.910
They handle research projects,

22:16.910 --> 22:18.420
and they literally get
boots on the ground

22:18.420 --> 22:21.000
and go out and investigate.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.590
These organizations
became very popular

22:23.590 --> 22:26.760
because there was
an overall change and shift

22:26.760 --> 22:28.840
in the thinking of
what these phenomena were.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.220
People were now coming out
and looking up to the skies

22:31.220 --> 22:32.680
just to look for the possibility

22:32.680 --> 22:34.560
that there could be
something up there,

22:34.560 --> 22:37.600
understanding the potential
of what these objects could be.

22:40.230 --> 22:43.230
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

22:43.230 --> 22:47.610
aliens have been visiting Earth
throughout mankind's history.

22:47.610 --> 22:52.580
So why is it that so many people
in the mid 20th century

22:52.580 --> 22:55.540
suddenly became obsessed
with finding evidence

22:55.540 --> 22:58.710
of extraterrestrial encounters?

22:58.710 --> 23:02.420
Some suggest
that the aliens themselves

23:02.420 --> 23:06.760
may in fact be responsible
for this increased awareness.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.050
Coral Lorenzen's
setting up of APRO,

23:12.050 --> 23:15.930
and Walt Andrus's
breakaway organization MUFON,

23:15.930 --> 23:20.100
all of these were inspired
by personal UFO encounters.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.270
So could it be that there was

23:22.270 --> 23:25.070
more than chance alone
at work here?

23:25.070 --> 23:29.320
Could it be that some force
was somehow targeting people

23:29.320 --> 23:33.780
like Coral Lorenzen
and Walter Andrus?

23:33.780 --> 23:36.950
Is there an overseeing presence

23:36.950 --> 23:40.410
that lies behind these
apparently chance encounters?

23:43.290 --> 23:45.840
NARRATOR: Could it be
that while extraterrestrials

23:45.840 --> 23:47.250
have kept their presence

23:47.250 --> 23:50.130
concealed from humanity
at large,

23:50.130 --> 23:53.840
they have chosen specific
individuals as emissaries,

23:53.840 --> 23:56.930
that will ultimately reveal
a greater truth?

23:59.140 --> 24:03.310
And if so, might their plan
to reconnect with humanity

24:03.310 --> 24:06.900
have been set in motion in 1934,

24:06.900 --> 24:10.530
when nine‐year‐old
Coral Lorenzen first spotted

24:10.530 --> 24:12.360
a strange object in the sky?

24:14.700 --> 24:18.740
Perhaps further answers can be
found by examining efforts

24:18.740 --> 24:22.160
to not only find evidence
of extraterrestrials,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.790
but to contact them.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.550
DAVID WILCOX:
This is a total game‐changer

24:31.550 --> 24:34.680
because it suggests
that a civilization

24:34.680 --> 24:36.850
that can harness the power
of an entire star

24:36.850 --> 24:38.810
actually does exist,

24:38.810 --> 24:40.640
and we can see it
with our telescopes.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.860
NARRATOR:
Delaware, Ohio.

24:50.860 --> 24:54.360
August 15, 1977.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.370
At Ohio State University's
Big Ear radio telescope,

24:59.370 --> 25:03.620
astronomer Jerry R. Ehman
conducts research for SETI,

25:03.620 --> 25:06.330
the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.460
While reviewing recorded data,

25:10.460 --> 25:13.170
he detects
a highly unusual signal

25:13.170 --> 25:16.970
originating from
the constellation Sagittarius.

25:16.970 --> 25:22.770
They're looking for this
bandwidth of 1,420 megahertz.

25:22.770 --> 25:25.020
Specifically, they believed

25:25.020 --> 25:27.900
that this bandwidth
corresponds to water,

25:27.900 --> 25:31.070
and that intelligent
civilizations might encode

25:31.070 --> 25:33.190
the electromagnetic frequency
of water

25:33.190 --> 25:34.990
with a detectable signal.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.160
So there is Jerry Ehman,
on the Big Ear telescope,

25:37.160 --> 25:42.490
doing his SETI work,
and a 72‐second burst comes in

25:42.490 --> 25:45.750
on the 1,420 megahertz signal.

25:45.750 --> 25:50.040
72 seconds
of very bizarre static

25:50.040 --> 25:52.000
that does not look natural.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.220
It looks artificial;
it looks like something

25:55.220 --> 25:58.010
that was intelligently
built and sent.

25:58.010 --> 26:02.850
So he writes "Wow!" next to
this part of the readout,

26:02.850 --> 26:06.770
and it is now known
as the "Wow! signal."

26:06.770 --> 26:08.730
And still to this day,
the Wow! signal

26:08.730 --> 26:10.860
has never been
properly explained,

26:10.860 --> 26:12.780
nor has it been deciphered.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.820
NARRATOR:
While there are various theories

26:16.820 --> 26:20.530
as to what may have caused
the now famous Wow! signal,

26:20.530 --> 26:23.990
from terrestrial radio
broadcasts to comet trails,

26:23.990 --> 26:27.410
SETI has not ruled out
the possibility

26:27.410 --> 26:31.090
that it may represent modern
man's first radio contact

26:31.090 --> 26:34.090
with extraterrestrials.

26:34.090 --> 26:37.510
And they have plans to reexamine
the area where it originated

26:37.510 --> 26:39.090
in the near future.

26:42.390 --> 26:46.100
To get a firsthand look
into this continued search

26:46.100 --> 26:50.190
for extraterrestrial life,
in March of 2016,

26:50.190 --> 26:53.770
researcher and publisher
Giorgio Tsoukalos

26:53.770 --> 26:58.110
traveled to the Allen Telescope
Array in Hat Creek, California,

26:58.110 --> 27:03.160
where he met with the director
for SETI research, Seth Shostak.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.540
This is truly amazing.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.750
What can you tell me
about this place?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.540
Well, this place is, uh,
an observatory.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.210
But it's a radio observatory.

27:10.210 --> 27:12.960
So these things around us,
these 42 antennas,

27:12.960 --> 27:14.880
they pick up radio waves.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.550
And we're trying to pick up
very special sort

27:16.550 --> 27:18.510
of radio waves,
namely some that would tell us

27:18.510 --> 27:19.930
somebody's out there.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.890
By having lots
of these dishes here,

27:21.890 --> 27:24.100
we can look at
more of the sky at once.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.140
We can look at multiple
star systems at once.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.140
Why radio waves?

27:29.140 --> 27:32.060
What's so significant
about radio waves?

27:32.060 --> 27:34.110
SHOSTAK: Radio waves go
at the speed of light,

27:34.110 --> 27:36.530
and they also, by the way,
go through all the gas and dust

27:36.530 --> 27:38.150
that's between the stars.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.200
So, you know,
if you want to communicate

27:40.200 --> 27:42.700
from one part of the galaxy
to another,

27:42.700 --> 27:44.870
radio waves are
a great way to do it.

27:44.870 --> 27:48.410
So the way this works is
actually kind of simple.

27:48.410 --> 27:51.460
I mean, the cosmic radio static,
it comes in from the sky,

27:51.460 --> 27:53.080
and it bounces off
that big reflector there,

27:53.080 --> 27:54.880
that first one, okay?

27:54.880 --> 27:57.420
‐That's‐that's a mirror
for radio waves. ‐Mm‐hmm.

27:57.420 --> 27:59.970
And that redirects them
to this secondary reflector,

27:59.970 --> 28:01.800
on the end, on the nose there.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.840
And then they're directed
to the receiver,

28:03.840 --> 28:05.680
and that's inside.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.470
That information goes through
a fiber optic

28:07.470 --> 28:10.350
over to the control room.

28:10.350 --> 28:13.350
So, this is where the, uh, data
coming through the fiber optics

28:13.350 --> 28:15.690
kind of ends up
after it's been processed

28:15.690 --> 28:17.110
in a display like this.

28:17.110 --> 28:19.820
And what are we looking at
right here?

28:19.820 --> 28:21.650
So we're looking, in this case,
at three star systems

28:21.650 --> 28:22.860
at once, okay?

28:22.860 --> 28:24.200
So that speeds up the search.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
It also allows us to determine

28:26.200 --> 28:28.740
whether we're really seeing E. T.
or just interference.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.500
The data from
one of these star systems

28:30.500 --> 28:32.660
is being displayed over on
this part of the screen here.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.580
This is called a waterfall plot.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.670
That... can you see,
can you see that line

28:36.670 --> 28:38.630
‐of brighter dots there?
‐This right here, yes. Mm‐hmm.

28:38.630 --> 28:41.130
SHOSTAK: Yeah, that's,
uh, slightly more static

28:41.130 --> 28:43.760
at that frequency
slowly going down the dot.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.590
That's the kind of thing
we're looking for.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.850
So then, if this here were
an actual E. T. signal,

28:48.850 --> 28:50.180
how would it
differentiate itself?

28:50.180 --> 28:51.680
Uh, would it be a bit thicker,

28:51.680 --> 28:53.730
a bit more pronounced,
a bit longer or...

28:53.730 --> 28:55.060
What are you looking for?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.730
It could be all of those things.

28:56.730 --> 28:58.860
So what you do is, when you find
a signal like this,

28:58.860 --> 29:00.150
you make a test.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.740
You'll just move the antennas
a little bit,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.780
and see if the signal goes away.

29:03.780 --> 29:06.620
And then point it back at the
star and see if it comes back.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.030
You say, "Well, that's
looking promising."

29:08.030 --> 29:10.870
You do that again,
go off, go on, go off, go on.

29:10.870 --> 29:13.830
If you do that five or ten
times, you start to get excited.

29:13.830 --> 29:16.670
I hope that that day will come
very soon.

29:16.670 --> 29:19.800
SHOSTAK: The Wow! signal
continues to intrigue people.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.720
So we are going to use
the Allen Telescope Array

29:23.720 --> 29:25.340
to reobserve the Wow! signal,

29:25.340 --> 29:27.090
look in the same spot
on the sky,

29:27.090 --> 29:29.100
look over a wider range
of frequencies,

29:29.100 --> 29:31.060
and‐and if there's
something up there

29:31.060 --> 29:33.390
and it's still broadcasting,
of course we would find it.

29:33.390 --> 29:36.770
NARRATOR:
While SETI has yet to find

29:36.770 --> 29:39.270
an explanation
for the Wow! signal,

29:39.270 --> 29:42.900
NASA's Kepler Telescope team
has continued to search

29:42.900 --> 29:46.780
for signs of alien life
in other solar systems,

29:46.780 --> 29:49.570
despite the U. S. government's
open denial

29:49.570 --> 29:52.240
of extraterrestrial contact.

29:54.500 --> 29:59.710
In September 2015, after more
than five years of research,

29:59.710 --> 30:02.340
members of
the Kepler team revealed

30:02.340 --> 30:04.050
some incredible findings

30:04.050 --> 30:09.680
coming from the star
KIC 8462852,

30:09.680 --> 30:12.430
also known as Tabby's Star,

30:12.430 --> 30:15.270
named for the astronomer
who discovered it.

30:15.270 --> 30:18.190
WILCOCK:
What we see from Tabby's Star

30:18.190 --> 30:21.570
is changes in light output

30:21.570 --> 30:26.860
that are not attributable
to comets, to planets,

30:26.860 --> 30:28.910
to asteroids

30:28.910 --> 30:33.040
or to other fragments
that would orbit the star.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.870
We're seeing quasi‐periodic
dimmings of the light

30:37.870 --> 30:42.130
that can be as much as a 21%
reduction in the luminosity

30:42.130 --> 30:43.960
that's coming out of the star.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.720
Now, we have the scientists
who are publishing papers

30:47.720 --> 30:50.550
in which they propose
that one of the explanations

30:50.550 --> 30:52.300
for what they are seeing

30:52.300 --> 30:55.520
is a massive
extraterrestrial construct

30:55.520 --> 30:59.270
akin to something known
as a Dyson sphere.

30:59.270 --> 31:02.150
A Dyson sphere is actually
a gigantic structure

31:02.150 --> 31:04.110
built around a star,

31:04.110 --> 31:06.530
which harnesses the energy
of the star, and could in fact

31:06.530 --> 31:09.450
be used to travel
from one place to another

31:09.450 --> 31:11.280
within the galaxy.

31:13.450 --> 31:16.750
This story is
a total game‐changer,

31:16.750 --> 31:20.500
because it suggests that
a Type II civilization,

31:20.500 --> 31:23.790
a civilization that can harness
the power of an entire star,

31:23.790 --> 31:27.380
actually does exist and we can
see it with our telescopes.

31:30.010 --> 31:33.050
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that astronomers hunting

31:33.050 --> 31:36.180
for habitable planets may have
accidentally discovered

31:36.180 --> 31:38.810
the first extrasolar
civilization?

31:40.480 --> 31:43.480
And if so,
why does the U. S. government

31:43.480 --> 31:48.150
continue to deny
extraterrestrial contact?

31:48.150 --> 31:50.990
While the true cause behind
the light patterns

31:50.990 --> 31:55.120
coming from Tabby's Star
has yet to be discovered,

31:55.120 --> 31:57.910
ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

31:57.910 --> 32:00.830
that world governments
have ramped up the hunt

32:00.830 --> 32:03.710
for extraterrestrial life

32:03.710 --> 32:06.630
because they already know
it exists.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.770
NARRATOR:
Toronto, Canada.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.730
September 2005.

32:21.730 --> 32:23.600
Paul Hellyer,

32:23.600 --> 32:26.980
who served as the Canadian
Minister of National Defence

32:26.980 --> 32:30.780
from 1963 to 1967,

32:30.780 --> 32:33.070
makes worldwide headlines

32:33.070 --> 32:37.410
by announcing his belief
in the existence of UFOs,

32:37.410 --> 32:39.240
and that
the United States government

32:39.240 --> 32:41.540
has made great efforts
to conceal knowledge

32:41.540 --> 32:44.750
of their existence for decades.

32:44.750 --> 32:47.040
To date, Mr. Hellyer remains

32:47.040 --> 32:49.250
the highest‐ranking
government official

32:49.250 --> 32:51.720
to ever publicly declare
this information.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.050
HELLYER:
I came to the conclusion

32:54.050 --> 32:57.600
that there are issues here
so profound

32:57.600 --> 33:01.060
for the future of
the United States and the world,

33:01.060 --> 33:03.770
that they have to be
discussed...

33:03.770 --> 33:06.230
openly and intelligently.

33:06.230 --> 33:09.520
And one of them, of course,
was the possibility

33:09.520 --> 33:12.650
the U. S. could get us
in an intergalactic war.

33:12.650 --> 33:16.070
And so, I decided that
I should speak out.

33:16.070 --> 33:19.370
UFOs are as real as
the airplanes flying overhead.

33:21.290 --> 33:25.000
This is actually paralleling
something that Edgar Mitchell‐‐

33:25.000 --> 33:26.790
the sixth man to walk
on the surface of the moon‐‐

33:26.790 --> 33:29.670
suggested, that there were
multiple alien races

33:29.670 --> 33:30.840
visiting the Earth.

33:32.630 --> 33:36.760
EDGAR MITCHELL:
This is not unknown knowledge.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.140
There are people that know

33:38.140 --> 33:40.810
and there seems to be
many different,

33:40.810 --> 33:45.100
perhaps several different
species of aliens visiting here.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.310
And it looks like,
likely they have been

33:47.310 --> 33:48.560
for a long, long time.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.150
(alarm blaring)

33:50.150 --> 33:54.530
People in the military
have witnessed UFO operations

33:54.530 --> 33:57.450
around our military facilities.

33:57.450 --> 34:01.990
And there's been quite a number
of reports of attempts to

34:01.990 --> 34:05.540
destroy some of
our missile tests

34:05.540 --> 34:07.540
and the missiles in flight.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.380
They are not
particularly pleased,

34:09.380 --> 34:12.960
the alien visitors,
with our warlike capabilities

34:12.960 --> 34:15.670
and our nuclear capabilities.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.590
UFO researchers have suggested

34:19.590 --> 34:22.260
that the U. S. military
has secretly built

34:22.260 --> 34:25.140
an installation
on the surface of the moon

34:25.140 --> 34:27.560
to help combat an alien threat.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.150
If there are extraterrestrials
visiting the Earth,

34:30.150 --> 34:32.110
and they're potentially hostile,

34:32.110 --> 34:33.820
it would make a great deal
of sense

34:33.820 --> 34:35.650
that we would be
prepared for this.

34:38.950 --> 34:42.990
NARRATOR: A secret military
installation on the moon?

34:42.990 --> 34:45.830
Could such claims,
along with those made

34:45.830 --> 34:48.870
by former Canadian
Defence Minister Paul Hellyer

34:48.870 --> 34:52.590
and Apollo astronaut
Edgar Mitchell, really be true?

34:54.800 --> 34:57.420
Perhaps further clues
can be found

34:57.420 --> 35:01.430
by examining
recently declassified documents.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.350
July 20, 2014.

35:08.350 --> 35:10.020
The United States Army

35:10.020 --> 35:14.320
declassifies and discloses one
of its biggest secret missions:

35:14.320 --> 35:16.990
Project Horizon.

35:16.990 --> 35:21.870
Project Horizon's mandate
was to create, by 1966,

35:21.870 --> 35:25.040
three years before the first
NASA landing of men on the moon,

35:25.040 --> 35:28.620
a military base which could hold
at least 20 individuals

35:28.620 --> 35:31.120
and which would be expanded on
over time as well.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.710
It would be nuclear powered.

35:32.710 --> 35:35.710
It would have
its own water supply, oxygen.

35:35.710 --> 35:38.630
And it really would be
the moon equivalent

35:38.630 --> 35:41.430
of a military installation.

35:41.430 --> 35:45.850
The feeling was,
from Wernher von Braun,

35:45.850 --> 35:49.060
from NASA and indeed
from‐from the entire government,

35:49.060 --> 35:54.400
that space would become
an important battlefield.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.900
We talk about
conventional warfare

35:56.900 --> 35:59.320
and how that would play out.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.620
It's fairly clear that
if there is another war,

36:03.620 --> 36:07.240
that space will be
a battlefield.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.410
HELLYER: The United States
has been working for a long time

36:10.410 --> 36:12.120
in building new weapons

36:12.120 --> 36:15.090
based on the technology
that they've gained.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.960
If you control
one of the approaches

36:17.960 --> 36:19.840
to the Earth,
it gives you an advantage

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
that you wouldn't
otherwise have.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.300
Also, it's a launching pad

36:24.300 --> 36:25.800
for anything you want to do
on Earth.

36:27.930 --> 36:29.430
NARRATOR:
Could it be,

36:29.430 --> 36:31.640
as some ancient
astronaut theorists contend,

36:31.640 --> 36:33.400
that the U. S. military

36:33.400 --> 36:36.980
was successful in the
construction of a military base

36:36.980 --> 36:38.860
on the surface of the moon?

36:40.780 --> 36:44.280
While the stated mission goal
was to establish dominance

36:44.280 --> 36:46.780
over the Soviet Union
during the Cold War,

36:46.780 --> 36:49.080
many believe the effort

36:49.080 --> 36:52.370
was not against an antagonistic
global super power,

36:52.370 --> 36:57.090
but an unknown
extraterrestrial force.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.000
MARTELL: This is even
further expanded upon

36:59.000 --> 37:00.670
when we look at Reagan's legacy

37:00.670 --> 37:02.880
and some of these things
like the Star Wars initiative.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.800
So, it's very possible that,

37:04.800 --> 37:07.350
when we look at what was
happening in the Cold War era,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.720
maybe they were trying
to divert attention

37:09.720 --> 37:11.640
to what was really going on.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.100
And that could have been
some type of collaboration

37:14.100 --> 37:15.440
between us and Russia,

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
of putting a space base
on the moon,

37:17.440 --> 37:19.980
or doing some other type
of space platform

37:19.980 --> 37:23.860
that currently now exists
within our solar system.

37:23.860 --> 37:29.240
There is no doubt in my mind
that Star Wars,

37:29.240 --> 37:31.790
initiated by President Reagan,

37:31.790 --> 37:35.670
was more related
to the possibility

37:35.670 --> 37:39.960
of being able to take the
extraterrestrials on for size

37:39.960 --> 37:42.380
than it was
against rogue states.

37:44.380 --> 37:47.390
All of the best information
available is that it was

37:47.390 --> 37:52.180
more intended as
a possible defense against UFOs

37:52.180 --> 37:54.850
than it was
against rogue missiles.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.480
NARRATOR:
Did the recent disclosure

37:59.480 --> 38:03.780
of Project Horizon only serve
to try to dissuade inquiry

38:03.780 --> 38:09.240
into a real and escalating
military presence in space?

38:09.240 --> 38:12.370
And, if so,
is the military preparing

38:12.370 --> 38:16.750
to actively hunt out the aliens
they've known about for decades?

38:18.460 --> 38:21.710
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

38:21.710 --> 38:24.960
and suggest that
with a recent NASA project,

38:24.960 --> 38:26.420
the U. S. government

38:26.420 --> 38:28.590
has reportedly enlisted
average citizens

38:28.590 --> 38:31.640
in the hunt
for extraterrestrial life.

38:37.940 --> 38:42.230
NARRATOR:
April 21, 2015.

38:42.230 --> 38:45.990
NASA launches
an unprecedented initiative

38:45.990 --> 38:49.110
that creates a coalition
of scientific experts

38:49.110 --> 38:51.240
with a mandate
to lead the search

38:51.240 --> 38:53.240
for life in the universe.

38:55.370 --> 38:57.660
This scientific endeavor,

38:57.660 --> 39:00.830
known as the Nexus
for Exoplanet System Science‐‐

39:00.830 --> 39:03.000
or "NExSS" for short‐‐

39:03.000 --> 39:07.670
is a game‐changer
in the discovery of alien life.

39:07.670 --> 39:10.180
COURTNEY DRESSING:
The NExSS is a multidiscipline,

39:10.180 --> 39:13.390
multi‐institute approach to try
to answer the big question of:

39:13.390 --> 39:15.270
are we alone in the galaxy?

39:15.270 --> 39:17.230
The NExSS includes researchers

39:17.230 --> 39:19.810
from multiple institutions
in different subfields.

39:19.810 --> 39:23.360
It includes astrophysicists,
planetary scientists,

39:23.360 --> 39:25.020
Earth scientists
and even helio‐physicists‐‐

39:25.020 --> 39:27.150
people who study the sun‐‐

39:27.150 --> 39:29.530
so we can put all of
the different pieces together

39:29.530 --> 39:31.490
and really learn
what makes a planet tick

39:31.490 --> 39:33.780
and what kind of planets
might have life on them;

39:33.780 --> 39:37.370
and if those planets do exist,
whether they have life at all.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.210
(steady beeping)

39:40.210 --> 39:41.580
NARRATOR:
Since the launch

39:41.580 --> 39:45.380
of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope
in 2009,

39:45.380 --> 39:47.630
more than 2,000 exoplanets‐‐

39:47.630 --> 39:51.680
a planet that orbits around
another star‐‐ have been found,

39:51.680 --> 39:54.050
with thousands
of additional candidates

39:54.050 --> 39:56.970
awaiting research
and confirmation.

39:56.970 --> 39:58.770
DRESSING:
The Planet Hunters project

39:58.770 --> 40:02.520
was the brainchild of NASA
and Yale researchers.

40:02.520 --> 40:06.440
The idea of the project is to
allow average, everyday people‐‐

40:06.440 --> 40:08.440
citizen scientists,
as we call them‐‐

40:08.440 --> 40:10.610
the opportunity
to discover planets.

40:10.610 --> 40:13.320
Citizen scientists have actually
done a tremendous service

40:13.320 --> 40:15.740
to the astrophysical community
by looking at Kepler data

40:15.740 --> 40:18.370
through
the Planet Hunters portal.

40:18.370 --> 40:20.750
Citizen scientists have really
accelerated the pace

40:20.750 --> 40:22.290
of exoplanet discoveries,

40:22.290 --> 40:26.170
because that core
of 260,000 people

40:26.170 --> 40:29.170
has looked at 20 million
light curves by eye.

40:29.170 --> 40:31.630
It's really interesting
that NASA is doing this,

40:31.630 --> 40:34.140
because the fact is
that they wouldn't be doing it

40:34.140 --> 40:36.010
unless they believed
that there were:

40:36.010 --> 40:38.930
A, habitable exoplanets
out there;

40:38.930 --> 40:41.940
B, that the general public
could help in finding them;

40:41.940 --> 40:45.650
and C, that there might be
alien life on those planets.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.150
As the executive director
of MUFON,

40:50.150 --> 40:52.780
I can tell you
this shift has already started.

40:52.780 --> 40:56.530
We get calls from
credible scientists, engineers,

40:56.530 --> 40:58.120
politicians and their staff,

40:58.120 --> 40:59.910
who want to know more
about this phenomenon,

40:59.910 --> 41:03.460
because they realize
that it is in fact real.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.540
So, as we look
into this question

41:05.540 --> 41:08.170
of who they are,
why they're here

41:08.170 --> 41:09.750
and where they're from,

41:09.750 --> 41:11.510
I think we'll learn more
about ourselves‐‐

41:11.510 --> 41:13.130
about who we are,

41:13.130 --> 41:16.800
where we're from
and why we're here.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.640
In the search
for extraterrestrial life,

41:19.640 --> 41:22.730
there are a number of questions
that need to be asked.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.230
Where's this gonna lead to?

41:24.230 --> 41:25.980
What are the implications?

41:25.980 --> 41:28.650
If we find extraterrestrials
are benevolent,

41:28.650 --> 41:31.690
well, that's good news;
it's gonna help us.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.740
If we find out
they're malevolent and hostile,

41:34.740 --> 41:38.870
we could find ourselves
in quite literally a world war.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.830
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
governments around the world

41:45.830 --> 41:49.960
are now openly on the hunt
for extraterrestrials

41:49.960 --> 41:53.970
because they already have
knowledge of their existence?

41:53.970 --> 41:58.010
And if so,
has the point finally come

41:58.010 --> 42:02.100
when this truth
can no longer be covered up?

42:02.100 --> 42:05.350
Perhaps it will soon be revealed

42:05.350 --> 42:10.190
that aliens have been visiting
Earth for thousands of years,

42:10.190 --> 42:15.150
and that we are not searching
for proof of their existence,

42:15.150 --> 42:19.040
but watching for their return.
