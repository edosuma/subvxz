00:01.834 --> 00:04.774
"The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss covered door.

00:04.775 --> 00:07.242
"You manage to open it
only to find yourself

00:07.244 --> 00:10.045
"face-to-face with a hideous,
foul-smelling,

00:10.047 --> 00:11.730
moss-covered ogre."

00:11.732 --> 00:13.865
What do you do?

00:13.867 --> 00:16.768
I say, "Hey, Ma,
what's for dinner?"

00:19.372 --> 00:21.656
Seventeen.

00:21.658 --> 00:25.660
The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

00:26.412 --> 00:29.498
By the by, I liked it, too.

00:31.050 --> 00:32.784
How go the wedding plans,
Howard?

00:32.786 --> 00:34.753
Great.
We spent five hours last night

00:34.755 --> 00:36.505
at Macy's registering for gifts.

00:36.507 --> 00:37.956
Looks like I'm finally going
to have

00:37.958 --> 00:39.791
that darling little earthenware
asparagus dish

00:39.793 --> 00:40.959
I've always wanted.

00:40.961 --> 00:42.460
See, this is the good thing

00:42.462 --> 00:45.096
about having a girlfriend
9,000 miles away.

00:45.098 --> 00:47.799
I can spend my nights
doing whatever I want.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.701
You mean like playing nerd games
with us

00:49.703 --> 00:53.137
and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

00:55.825 --> 00:58.026
Maybe.

00:58.945 --> 01:01.646
We enter the dungeon.

01:01.648 --> 01:03.448
You see a dragon.

01:03.450 --> 01:05.951
Really? So we're playing
Dungeons & Dragons

01:05.953 --> 01:08.670
and we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

01:09.739 --> 01:12.173
Isn't that a little
on the nose?

01:12.175 --> 01:14.709
When you play Chutes and
Ladders, do you complain

01:14.711 --> 01:17.045
about all the chutes
and all the ladders?

01:18.163 --> 01:21.349
Are you gonna eat
that whole pie?

01:21.351 --> 01:23.635
Maybe. Why not?

01:23.637 --> 01:26.671
Who do I have in my life
to watch my figure for?

01:27.974 --> 01:30.058
Oh, God, did you watch
Bridget Jones again?

01:30.977 --> 01:33.728
No, it's just that
everybody's got someone.

01:33.730 --> 01:36.364
Sheldon's with Amy,
Howard's getting married,

01:36.366 --> 01:37.849
you're dating my sister.

01:37.851 --> 01:39.484
Now that Howard's
getting married,

01:39.486 --> 01:42.186
maybe he'll inflate one of
his old girlfriends for you.

01:43.522 --> 01:45.240
You know who I blame
for my loneliness?

01:45.242 --> 01:46.524
The United States of America.

01:46.526 --> 01:49.544
Your movies and your TV shows
promised streets paved

01:49.546 --> 01:52.998
with beautiful blonde women
with big bazongas.

01:53.966 --> 01:56.585
Eat another pie,
you'll have your own bazongas.

01:57.503 --> 01:58.703
That's cruel.

01:58.705 --> 02:00.422
You know it goes
straight to my hips.

02:01.474 --> 02:02.974
Gentlemen, please focus.

02:02.976 --> 02:05.477
You're facing
a fire-breathing dragon.

02:05.479 --> 02:07.145
I don't know if I want
to play anymore.

02:07.147 --> 02:09.931
Because you don't have
a girlfriend?

02:09.933 --> 02:11.566
Well, good Lord,
if that becomes a reason not

02:11.568 --> 02:14.603
to play Dungeons & Dragons, this
game's in serious trouble.

02:42.679 --> 02:45.640
Now, I assume we use
this same wax later on

02:45.641 --> 02:47.941
to neaten up
each other's bikini regions.

02:47.943 --> 02:51.111
Yeah, my bikini region
is fine.

02:51.113 --> 02:53.463
Who's shocked? I'm not.

02:56.235 --> 02:58.601
So, Bernadette, how's the
wedding planning going?

02:58.603 --> 03:00.954
And I'm not asking
as a prospective bridesmaid.

03:00.956 --> 03:03.490
Pick me! Pick me!

03:04.659 --> 03:08.295
We went cake-tasting yesterday.

03:08.297 --> 03:09.612
Raj came along.

03:09.614 --> 03:12.949
He cried and ate half
the samples.

03:12.951 --> 03:15.085
Oh, the poor guy's so lonely.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.920
We should set him up
with someone.

03:16.922 --> 03:20.456
You know, I met
a really cute girl at work.

03:20.458 --> 03:23.393
She's married to a guy
in one of our drug trials.

03:24.395 --> 03:26.112
Well, hello?

03:26.114 --> 03:27.530
She's married.

03:27.532 --> 03:29.316
Yeah, but her husband is in

03:29.318 --> 03:31.301
serious congestive
heart failure,

03:31.303 --> 03:36.489
and a little birdie told me
he's in the placebo group.

03:38.142 --> 03:40.610
Okay, so future
grief-stricken widow

03:40.612 --> 03:42.162
is the one to beat.

03:44.448 --> 03:46.366
Are we ready to order?

03:46.368 --> 03:47.334
One moment.

03:47.336 --> 03:49.202
I'm conducting
an experiment.

03:49.204 --> 03:53.173
With Dungeons
& Dragons dice?

03:54.342 --> 03:56.960
Yes. From here on in,
I've decided

03:56.962 --> 03:59.829
to make all trivial decisions
with a throw of the dice,

03:59.831 --> 04:01.181
thus freeing up my mind

04:01.183 --> 04:04.768
do what it does best--
enlighten and amaze.

04:05.936 --> 04:10.357
Page 14,
item seven.

04:10.359 --> 04:11.891
So, what's for dinner?

04:11.893 --> 04:15.061
A side of corn
succotash.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.279
Hmm. Interesting.

04:17.281 --> 04:20.516
Um, Howard, can I see you
for a minute, please?

04:20.517 --> 04:22.819
I don't want to show any more
of your friends

04:22.821 --> 04:26.156
how I can fit
in the booster seats.

04:26.158 --> 04:29.192
Uh, no, that's not it.
Just come with me, please.

04:30.861 --> 04:34.197
Let's see what I'll be washing
that succotash down with.

04:37.084 --> 04:38.885
A pitcher of margaritas.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.756
Do you really want that?

04:42.758 --> 04:44.224
That's the great thing.

04:44.226 --> 04:45.558
It doesn't matter.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.145
My mind is freed up to think
about more important things.

04:49.147 --> 04:51.014
What's it thinking
about now?

04:51.016 --> 04:53.433
Hamburgers and lemonade.

04:54.602 --> 04:58.071
Um, Raj, there's someone
I want you to meet.

04:58.073 --> 05:00.607
This is my friend Emily.
I know her from my spin class.

05:03.444 --> 05:06.479
Raj, relax.
She can't hear you. She's deaf.

05:07.331 --> 05:11.734
Emily, this is
our friend Raj.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.537
Oh!

05:14.539 --> 05:17.573
Look at you guys
just hitting it off.

05:17.575 --> 05:19.242
I am so good.

05:25.049 --> 05:26.599
Hi.

05:28.769 --> 05:30.420
She says, "It's
nice to meet you""

05:30.422 --> 05:31.638
Does she really mean that

05:31.640 --> 05:33.356
or was she signing it
sarcastically?

05:34.859 --> 05:39.028
Raj says it's nice
to meet you, too.

05:39.030 --> 05:41.448
She says she has to go
back to her family,

05:41.450 --> 05:43.650
but Penny has her
number if you want

05:43.652 --> 05:45.535
to text her and
get together.

05:45.537 --> 05:47.770
Okay, I'm going to play it cool.

05:47.772 --> 05:52.208
Tell her,
"Maybe. Whatever, babe."

05:54.111 --> 05:56.129
He'll text you.

05:58.666 --> 06:01.384
Look at that. I have a date.

06:01.386 --> 06:02.952
I love America again.

06:06.674 --> 06:08.308
And now for dessert...

06:08.310 --> 06:11.294
Come on, hot fudge sundae,
come on, hot fudge sundae.

06:11.296 --> 06:13.313
Bam!
That's what I'm talking about!

06:16.484 --> 06:18.651
Okay, as soon
as she gets here,

06:18.653 --> 06:20.353
so she knows
I'm cool with it,

06:20.355 --> 06:22.655
I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.

06:26.026 --> 06:29.279
I was thinking, "Hey,
did you hear the one about...?

06:29.281 --> 06:31.147
Oh, no, I bet you didn't."

06:33.284 --> 06:37.420
Maybe we should revisit
your lonely fat guy plan.

06:37.422 --> 06:39.422
Oh, she's here.

06:39.957 --> 06:42.625
No joke.

06:46.881 --> 06:48.481
She says she's sorry
she's late.

06:48.483 --> 06:49.933
Tell her
it doesn't matter.

06:49.935 --> 06:53.019
Tell her, her eyes shimmer
like opalescent lilies

06:53.021 --> 06:57.273
in the lake of the palace
of the celestial maidens.

06:58.392 --> 06:59.943
Really?

06:59.945 --> 07:01.895
That's the first thing
you want to say?

07:01.897 --> 07:03.646
I worked on it all night.
Use it.

07:03.648 --> 07:05.732
Look, I don't know the
sign for opalescent.

07:05.734 --> 07:06.866
Then spell it.

07:06.868 --> 07:08.234
I don't know how to spell it.

07:08.236 --> 07:10.019
You're blowing this for me!

07:12.022 --> 07:13.740
He likes your eyes.

07:13.742 --> 07:16.192
You're making me sound
like a caveman.

07:17.361 --> 07:19.412
She says, "Thank you.
You have nice eyes, too."

07:19.414 --> 07:22.081
Really? Ask her how many
children she wants,

07:22.083 --> 07:25.385
and whatever number she says,
say, "Me, too."

07:28.205 --> 07:29.722
No.

07:29.724 --> 07:32.725
Fine. Tell her I have a deep,
sexy voice

07:32.727 --> 07:34.677
like James Earl Jones.

07:34.679 --> 07:38.515
She doesn't know what James
Earl Jones sounds like.

07:38.517 --> 07:41.818
Great.
Then she won't know I'm lying.

07:43.938 --> 07:46.990
Let's see, what else
can I tell you about me

07:46.992 --> 07:51.327
that would make you
like me?

07:51.329 --> 07:52.779
Ooh, I love music.

07:54.114 --> 07:55.748
Do you love music?

07:55.750 --> 08:00.036
You really want
to ask her that?

08:00.038 --> 08:02.839
You're right.
Everyone loves music.

08:04.842 --> 08:07.427
She says, "Do you play
an instrument?"

08:07.429 --> 08:09.078
No,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.430
but when I was
six years old,

08:10.432 --> 08:12.465
I tried to start
a boy band called

08:12.467 --> 08:15.218
Frankie Goes
to Bollywood.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.590
But I couldn't get
any other boys to join,

08:20.592 --> 08:22.559
so my parents asked
the servants

08:22.561 --> 08:25.028
to be my backup dancers.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.429
Wait, when you sign
"servants,"

08:26.431 --> 08:27.614
don't sign it
like I'm bragging.

08:27.616 --> 08:29.482
Sign it in a way
that I sound humble

08:29.484 --> 08:34.537
with just a hint of
"That's right, I had servants."

08:35.405 --> 08:37.457
Do you hear yourself

08:37.458 --> 08:41.210
Yes, but she doesn't.
So get signing, hand monkey.

08:44.965 --> 08:49.618
I think I wrote a letter
to Santa Claus every day.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.137
And then on Christmas morning,

08:51.139 --> 08:54.056
under the tree is
a little puppy

08:54.058 --> 08:56.308
with a red ribbon.

08:57.428 --> 08:58.677
What are you doing?

08:58.679 --> 09:00.846
Texting Bernadette that
I'm gonna be late.

09:01.464 --> 09:02.648
Dude, what is she saying?

09:02.650 --> 09:04.517
It's a funny story
about a puppy.

09:04.519 --> 09:06.135
Just smile and laugh.

09:08.738 --> 09:10.739
- Quick, quick, stop smiling.
- What? Why?

09:10.741 --> 09:12.942
The puppy died-- it
choked on a doll head.

09:12.944 --> 09:14.527
Sad face, sad face!

09:17.614 --> 09:19.865
It's a little hard
to see with the city lights,

09:19.867 --> 09:23.485
but that W-shaped constellation
is Cassiopeia.

09:23.487 --> 09:26.655
And she was the mother
of Andromeda who's over there.

09:27.924 --> 09:30.876
Look, pretty stars.

09:33.513 --> 09:36.999
This is her car.

09:37.001 --> 09:38.551
She hopes she can see you again
sometime.

09:38.553 --> 09:40.302
Good, good.

09:40.304 --> 09:41.937
Oh, boy,

09:41.939 --> 09:42.888
help me out here.

09:42.890 --> 09:44.673
Does she want me
to kiss her or not?

09:44.675 --> 09:47.342
I speak sign language,
I don't read minds.

09:47.344 --> 09:48.561
If you were me,
would you kiss her?

09:48.563 --> 09:51.013
Yeah, but I'm a make out king.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.074

10:00.657 --> 10:04.193
I was so smooth
on that date.

10:04.195 --> 10:06.712
You? I made
you smooth.

10:06.714 --> 10:08.080
You were an idiot.

10:08.082 --> 10:09.548
Whatever, dude.
She kissed me.

10:09.550 --> 10:11.133
It might've been
on your lips,

10:11.135 --> 10:12.418
but it was my kiss.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.887
Oh, fine. Let's agree
she kissed both of us.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.207
Okay.

10:23.771 --> 10:26.522
Mustache is looking good
there, Sheldon.

10:29.581 --> 10:31.132
Don't thank me.
Thank the dice.

10:31.134 --> 10:34.585
They told me what percentage
of my face to shave.

10:34.587 --> 10:36.387
Why are you still doing this?

10:36.389 --> 10:37.838
Because it's working.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.473
In the past few weeks,

10:39.475 --> 10:41.342
unburdened by
trivial decisions,

10:41.344 --> 10:43.177
I've co-authored
two papers

10:43.179 --> 10:44.261
in notable peer-reviewed
journals,

10:44.263 --> 10:46.981
and I'm close to
figuring out why

10:46.983 --> 10:48.399
the Large Hadron
Collider has yet

10:48.401 --> 10:50.684
to isolate the Higgs
boson particle.

10:50.686 --> 10:53.053
You left out,
got chafed testicles

10:53.055 --> 10:55.656
because you no longer
wear underpants.

10:58.393 --> 11:01.562
The dice giveth
and the dice taketh away.

11:03.231 --> 11:05.166
Is Raj out
with Emily again?

11:05.168 --> 11:07.168
Yeah, every night
for the last month.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.253
Wow, can't believe
he has a girlfriend.

11:11.089 --> 11:12.623
Me neither.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.910
Here's some other fun news
on the Raj/Emily front.

11:16.912 --> 11:20.347
He gave her a pair of diamond
earrings and leased her a car.

11:20.349 --> 11:21.765
You're kidding.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.717
You think she's taking
advantage of him?

11:23.719 --> 11:24.935
Oh, of course not.

11:24.937 --> 11:26.637
She wouldn't do
something like that.

11:26.639 --> 11:28.355
She's deaf.

11:30.225 --> 11:33.310
Deaf women can't be
gold diggers?

11:33.312 --> 11:35.396
Handicapped people
are nice, Leonard.

11:35.398 --> 11:37.698
Everyone knows that.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.735
Yeah, I actually
have information about Raj

11:41.737 --> 11:43.821
that would be helpful
with this discussion.

11:47.492 --> 11:50.544
Could you tell us?

11:50.546 --> 11:52.746
Let's see.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.800
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

11:58.003 --> 11:59.336
Wait, hang on.

11:59.338 --> 12:00.721
Doubles.
Roll again.

12:03.675 --> 12:05.342
Okay, get this.

12:07.262 --> 12:09.563
It doesn't matter if
he's showering her with gifts,

12:09.565 --> 12:12.799
because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.

12:13.652 --> 12:15.019
What do you mean
"vastly wealthy"?

12:15.021 --> 12:17.321
Well, "wealthy" means
a lot of money.

12:17.323 --> 12:18.522
"Vastly" means even more.

12:18.524 --> 12:20.858
I'm not sure
what's tripping you up.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.028
Look, I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.312
No, you're wrong.

12:25.314 --> 12:27.981
As you know, a few years ago,
I achieved one of

12:27.983 --> 12:30.618
my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.086
Well, from
time to time,

12:32.088 --> 12:35.623
I notarize
banking documents for Raj.

12:35.625 --> 12:40.327
The Koothrappalis aren't just
rich, they're Richie Rich rich.

12:41.546 --> 12:43.464
Well, so how much is that?

12:43.466 --> 12:47.218
About halfway between
Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.

12:48.103 --> 12:49.069
What the hell?

12:49.071 --> 12:50.688
The last time
we went to the zoo,

12:50.690 --> 12:53.357
that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.

12:53.359 --> 12:55.893
Listen, guys, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude,

12:55.895 --> 12:59.480
but I need to go call Raj's
sister, who I love so much.

13:00.982 --> 13:03.867
So vastly much.

13:05.704 --> 13:10.708
Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts and a car.

13:10.710 --> 13:12.793
And she got him to pay off
all her credit cards.

13:12.795 --> 13:15.696
What? He paid off
her credit cards?

13:15.698 --> 13:18.632
Damn it, I could've dated Raj
for a couple months.

13:20.218 --> 13:22.469
But I-I wouldn't have, because
I'm not that kind of girl.

13:22.471 --> 13:24.305
We should really talk to Raj.

13:24.307 --> 13:27.141
He's not going to listen,
he's in love.

13:27.143 --> 13:28.842
Can't figure out what to do?

13:28.844 --> 13:31.061
I remember those days.

13:31.063 --> 13:34.398
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to...

13:34.400 --> 13:36.483
stay right here.

13:39.604 --> 13:41.238
Yeah, this is a bad idea.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.439
- We should go.
- No.

13:42.441 --> 13:44.074
I'm the one that
introduced him to her.

13:44.076 --> 13:45.609
I've got to
say something.

13:48.446 --> 13:50.080
Wow.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.900
You're engaged
to my friend.

13:53.902 --> 13:56.236
Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind
where I get my motor running,

13:56.238 --> 13:59.406
as long as I park
in the right garage.

14:01.543 --> 14:04.244
I can't believe
you're engaged to my friend.

14:06.047 --> 14:07.831
Oh, here she comes.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.234
Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick
can't hear you.

14:14.973 --> 14:16.006
Hi.

14:16.008 --> 14:17.691
Oh, hey, hi.

14:17.693 --> 14:18.776
Nice to see you.

14:18.778 --> 14:22.112
Um, can we talk
to you about Raj?

14:23.248 --> 14:24.782
She says, "Sure,
what about him""

14:24.784 --> 14:27.368
Okay, um, gosh,
how do I start?

14:27.370 --> 14:31.104
Um, see, Raj is
kind of naive.

14:31.106 --> 14:33.540
I mean, he hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.

14:33.542 --> 14:37.411
And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to,

14:37.413 --> 14:38.962
you might be
taking advantage of him.

14:38.964 --> 14:41.615
You know, by letting him buy you
a bunch of expensive things.

14:41.617 --> 14:42.716
And I-I...

14:42.718 --> 14:44.468
Howard, focus.

14:44.470 --> 14:45.836
Tell her what I'm saying.

14:45.838 --> 14:46.837
Right.

14:46.839 --> 14:48.639
Are you a gold digger or not?

14:50.709 --> 14:52.509
Oh, uh, something,
something,

14:52.511 --> 14:54.411
who the something do
you think you are?

14:54.413 --> 14:55.979
Mind your own
something business

14:55.981 --> 14:58.682
and go something
yourself.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.351
Oh.

15:00.353 --> 15:02.736
Wait, I got
this now.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.973
I'm so mad at you!

15:06.975 --> 15:08.108
Okay, wait...

15:08.110 --> 15:10.077
How dare you ambush my
girlfriend at the gym!

15:10.079 --> 15:11.745
We didn't mean
for it to be an ambush.

15:11.747 --> 15:15.582
Just, it's kind of impossible
not to sneak up on deaf people.

15:15.584 --> 15:19.253
And hey, since when
are you so chatty?

15:19.255 --> 15:20.487
I'm hammered.

15:20.489 --> 15:21.955
Raj, come here.

15:21.957 --> 15:24.875
This girl is trouble.

15:24.877 --> 15:26.593
I mean, what kind of
relationship is it

15:26.595 --> 15:29.129
where you buy her gifts
and she gives you sex?

15:29.131 --> 15:31.932
The best one I ever had!

15:32.767 --> 15:34.268
Okay, come on.

15:34.270 --> 15:35.803
You know you
can do better.

15:35.805 --> 15:38.338
Aha.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.973
I see what's going on here.

15:39.975 --> 15:43.060
You and I had
our crazy night together,

15:43.062 --> 15:45.813
and now you can't stand
to see me with another woman.

15:45.815 --> 15:47.698
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's okay.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.433
I can't get mad
at your feelings.

15:49.435 --> 15:50.701
I don't have feelings.

15:50.703 --> 15:51.685
Yeah, that's good.

15:51.687 --> 15:53.787
Keep telling
yourself that.

15:54.706 --> 15:57.624
He is cuter
now that I know he's rich.

16:01.413 --> 16:04.197
I have a surprise
for you.

16:04.199 --> 16:05.466
Cover your eyes.

16:07.385 --> 16:09.753
Open them.

16:19.097 --> 16:21.348
It's a real ruby.

16:21.350 --> 16:24.151
It was a little
expensive,

16:24.153 --> 16:28.021
but no one can put
a price on love.

16:28.023 --> 16:31.492
Although, the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.

16:38.116 --> 16:39.416
Oh, Mummy, Daddy.

16:39.418 --> 16:40.784
What a nice surprise.

16:40.786 --> 16:44.471
No, it's not a nice surprise,
it's a bad surprise.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.573
Penny called us.

16:46.575 --> 16:47.674
Penny?

16:47.676 --> 16:49.059
She told us
you're spending all our money

16:49.061 --> 16:50.227
on your new girlfriend.

16:50.995 --> 16:53.597
I just got her a
couple of things.

16:53.599 --> 16:55.782
She gives me things, too.

16:55.784 --> 16:56.967
Yeah, yeah, I'm
a gynecologist.

16:56.969 --> 16:59.670
I know exactly
what she gives you.

17:00.772 --> 17:04.107
You need to find a nice
Indian girl from a good family.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.425
If you keep seeing this woman,
you're cut off.

17:06.428 --> 17:09.413
What? You're going to make me
choose between the woman I love

17:09.415 --> 17:13.483
and the money I... have
very strong feelings for?

17:13.486 --> 17:15.452
It's up to you.

17:16.855 --> 17:19.388
Well, I choose love.

17:19.391 --> 17:21.074
You're an idiot.

17:23.211 --> 17:25.412
Love doesn't last.

17:31.452 --> 17:35.055
Well, he's going to
find out eventually.

17:35.057 --> 17:36.557
Think about it.

17:41.896 --> 17:46.483
My parents are making me
choose between money and you.

17:46.485 --> 17:48.852
I choose you.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.107
No, I think we'll have
to return the car.

17:55.243 --> 17:57.494
And that necklace,
yeah, that, too.

17:57.496 --> 17:59.663
But none of those
things matter,

17:59.665 --> 18:02.366
because we have
something better.

18:02.368 --> 18:04.484
We have love.

18:13.928 --> 18:17.698
Oh, Penny, I
hurt so bad.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.299
I know, I know.

18:19.301 --> 18:21.301
Sometimes I put
the TV on mute

18:21.303 --> 18:23.520
just to pretend
she's still with me.

18:29.644 --> 18:33.363
But I can't watch the closed
captioning without crying.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.851
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:37.853 --> 18:39.853
I wish I could
make you feel better.

18:39.855 --> 18:41.572
Seriously?

18:41.574 --> 18:43.707
I'm heartbroken and
you're hitting on me?

18:43.709 --> 18:45.409
What?! No!

18:45.411 --> 18:47.911
Look, Penny,
you're great,

18:47.913 --> 18:50.130
but I had a long talk
with my parents,

18:50.132 --> 18:53.917
and they said if I date an
Indian girl, I get a Maserati.

19:00.219 --> 19:00.985
Mmm.

19:00.986 --> 19:02.186
Oh, cheesecake,

19:02.188 --> 19:03.720
you're just as good as a woman,

19:03.722 --> 19:05.656
even though I can't
have sex with you.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.660
Try throwing it in the microwave
for a few seconds.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.868
Should I use the rest room
or wait until we get home?

19:17.870 --> 19:20.587
Come on, papa needs
to void his bladder.

19:20.589 --> 19:23.674
Oh, that's not what you want
to see after three buttermilks.

19:25.093 --> 19:26.260
Here you go, boys.

19:26.262 --> 19:28.078
I'll pick it up
when you're ready.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.429
Thanks for dinner,
buddy.

19:29.431 --> 19:31.215
Yeah, real big of you.

19:31.217 --> 19:33.200
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

19:34.144 --> 19:35.293
Oh, and don't cheap
out on the tip.

19:35.295 --> 19:36.711
We all know
you're loaded now.
