WEBVTT

02:15.803 --> 02:16.970
Mother!

02:17.605 --> 02:19.540
Mother, soldiers
are coming!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.275
I thought we would
have longer.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.446
It is the Tudors, then?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.482
Or what passes for his army.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.984
Is the rider here
for Perkin?
There's no time.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.387
Quickly now, Richard,
as we planned.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.055
You must hide.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
And us, Mother?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.460
Girls, come with me.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.495
To where
though, Lizzie?
Come.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.469
Quickly now, my Perk.
I must protect you.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.703
I will tell them
I'm Prince Perkin...

02:49.803 --> 02:51.138
They think that
you are dead, my love,

02:51.239 --> 02:52.573
and so you will be
if you don't escape now.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.242
I want to stay
and fight.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.545
My darling Richard.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.646
My Perkin.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.415
Go to Tournai.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.551
Find Jan Warbecque,
the boatman.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.652
Pretend to be his son.

03:06.254 --> 03:09.357
I promise I will fetch you
back to England
and put you on the throne.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.435
Up inside.
Quickly now.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.707
I cannot lose you as I did
your brother, Edward.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.542
Do it for me, my Perkin.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.599
I am Princess Elizabeth
of York!

03:52.566 --> 03:54.134
I am betrothed
to King Henry Tudor

03:54.302 --> 03:57.137
and he will kill you
if you lay a hand on us.

03:57.305 --> 04:00.374
King Henry sent us here to
fetch you back to London.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
By the hair, if need be.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.614
He didn't specify a method.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.449
There is no need
for that.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.551
Sir Thomas Stanley.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.321
Elizabeth Woodville.
Sir William.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.625
We will come willingly,
of course.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.662
We have been waiting
to be summoned.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.513
Where is the Earl
of Warwick?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.350
Get out! Get out!

04:42.650 --> 04:45.853
Have it. Have
everything you want.
Please don't hurt us.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.488
For York!
For Uncle Richard!

04:47.588 --> 04:48.722
Teddy, no!

04:48.822 --> 04:50.424
They're not Richard's men,
they're Tudors!

04:59.667 --> 05:03.103
King Henry Tudor
has ordered the traitors
to be brought to London.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.472
Traitors?

05:04.572 --> 05:06.374
Men who fought against
him in the battle.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.908
That doesn't
make us traitors!

05:08.008 --> 05:09.377
We fought for our king,
Richard.

05:09.443 --> 05:13.581
King Henry has declared
his reign began the day
before the battle.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.584
Those that fought
against him are
declared traitors.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
Ah, the Earl of Warwick.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.090
The king is waiting for you.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.424
This is yours now, Henry.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.092
Your kingdom.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.495
Your throne.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.842
Burn them.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.877
And ban the snow
from falling.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.779
I will have nothing white
in England.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.451
Where are my rooms?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.460
The king's rooms, Henry.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.733
I have dreamed of this
my entire life.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.637
You always said
God had chosen me.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.475
You have always known
His will.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.677
And He will
guide you.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.945
As will I
as I know England.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.951
I will take
the queen's rooms
for myself,

06:59.653 --> 07:00.921
through this passageway.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.667
So, this is how he treats
the woman he expects
to make his queen?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.903
I thought he would
at least show some respect.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.271
It's intended as
a show of strength,

07:18.706 --> 07:21.909
but it only goes to show
his weakness if he stoops
to bully girls.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.677
Perhaps the worst
is yet to come.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.946
What could be worse than
killing my poor Richard?

07:26.046 --> 07:29.517
Lizzie, you must not
speak of it.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.520
No one must know
what has passed
between the two of you.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.254
Did my brother get away?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.757
We must pray to God
he will.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.748
Jasper!

08:09.557 --> 08:10.758
Welcome to Westminster,
eh, Henry?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.026
Come.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.829
Jasper.
How are you?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.608
My Lady Margaret.

08:31.579 --> 08:35.048
Who would have thought
to find us here like this

08:35.148 --> 08:36.650
with Henry
on the throne.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.686
I did.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.588
I always did.

08:42.590 --> 08:46.860
And your strength kept us
through the dark and cold
and bad times.

08:47.761 --> 08:51.665
And now
my stepson is king.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.819
Move it.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.025
Teddy, Teddy.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.392
What is this?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.461
My cousins are here.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.863
And my aunt and uncle.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.364
Lizzie.
Teddy.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.666
Teddy, come back.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.767
Teddy.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.007
Your Grace.
Thank you, Ned.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.681
Dear God, save us.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.883
My brothers are all dead
and now we shall be next.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.719
He dates his kingship from
the day before the battle,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.120
so we are all
named traitors.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.155
But he cannot simply...

09:48.255 --> 09:50.057
Well, he has.
And Parliament
has allowed it.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.792
Or his mother did!

09:53.360 --> 09:55.095
That woman's waited half her
life to take her vengeance
on the House of York.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.364
I am so sorry
for your sons.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.867
The England we once knew
is gone,

09:59.967 --> 10:01.601
and with it
chivalry and honor.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.637
We are Yorks, Eliza.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.838
We do not quake in fear.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.975
We must see how this
plays out.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.114
You will appear before
the king.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.460
You must not speak
unless I tell you to.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.529
Dear Teddy.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.799
Now... Hold my hand
tightly, now.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.069
Marching on! Marching on!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.771
Move, you old scum!

10:40.040 --> 10:41.141
Move!

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
Come.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.787
There is to be no welcome

10:54.054 --> 10:56.056
for the promised
Queen of England?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.026
The king has lost
his manners?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.931
He will see you
when he's seen
the traitors.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.836
The others who
loved Richard.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.077
These are not
the queen's rooms.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.949
The king's mother,
my wife, has those.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.084
As First Lady
of the Court.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.419
I'll bring some ladies
to attend you.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.861
Perhaps he does not need me
as he means to wed his mother.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.930
He needs you.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.198
He based his claim
for England

11:38.298 --> 11:40.067
on you being
by his side.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.669
With you,
he joins the Houses.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.772
And that is what you want
for me, even now?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.140
I am to be
the spoils of war?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.876
The wife of
a marauding madman

11:48.976 --> 11:50.610
whose mother
even murdered children

11:50.778 --> 11:51.879
just so he could
snatch the crown?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.680
You knew that
you would marry

11:53.781 --> 11:55.048
whichever one of
them should win.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.084
This man is the victor.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.487
For now, at least.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.891
You are sworn
to be his queen

12:03.991 --> 12:05.325
and nothing now could
change that.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.127
Well, unless
he does not want her.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.000
Now, girls, please listen.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.302
Smile sweetly
to their faces

12:15.402 --> 12:17.137
but know them for the
Tudor spies they are

12:17.237 --> 12:19.472
and lose your tongues
when they are near.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.220
That childless bitch
in Burgundy will reap
her just desserts.

12:34.121 --> 12:34.988
I wonder if they've
told her yet

12:35.088 --> 12:37.891
her brother's lying dead
on Bosworth Field.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.162
Scribe.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.164
"I, Henry Tudor,
King of England,

12:44.264 --> 12:47.200
"hereby, prohibit
any English trade
with Burgundy."

12:48.235 --> 12:49.236
There.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.972
That's for all the times
that Yorkist duchess

12:52.072 --> 12:54.842
tried to catch me in her trap
for Richard's executioner.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.111
You must decree
the English Lords'
reduce their guards,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.047
or they will form them
into private armies

13:00.147 --> 13:01.949
and rise up
at every tax you levy.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.218
Are we certain
the York Princes
are truly dead?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.223
- If one of them still lives...
- They are both dead.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.859
It is well known.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.194
King Richard killed both
princes in the Tower.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.232
There is nobody
for England now but you.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.277
Step forward.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.283
Which one of you is
John de la Pole,
the Earl of Lincoln?

13:52.900 --> 13:56.937
The dead York king named you
his heir before the battle.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.975
You understand that
this has been revoked

14:02.075 --> 14:03.276
and you are
now heir to nothing?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.249
Do you understand that?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.989
I pledge my allegiance
to you, Your Grace.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.724
I do not.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.296
You are not the king,
in law nor in God's eyes.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.967
And while you may have killed
my son and stolen his crown,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.969
you are descended
from a servant.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.973
And while my grandson
may impersonate his fealty,

14:33.073 --> 14:35.976
I bow only to God
and to my own
conscience.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.144
Mother.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.411
Please...

14:39.546 --> 14:41.214
Your sister in Burgundy
would never stoop so low.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.050
And she has had her
trading licenses revoked

14:43.150 --> 14:44.317
so you should
shut your mouth!

14:48.956 --> 14:52.259
You may be glad
you are an old woman

14:52.492 --> 14:55.095
whose noise is
of no consequence
to His Grace.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.000
You will swear fealty
or be thrown into the Tower.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.368
Jasper Tudor.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.171
You would not dare.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.209
Take her away.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.443
You can't.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.082
You will release me!

15:18.385 --> 15:19.452
Let me walk.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.021
Let me walk.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.261
Who are these?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.330
Edward and Margaret
Plantagenet,

15:30.430 --> 15:33.000
son and daughter of George,
Duke of Clarence.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.201
The Earl of Warwick,
Your Grace.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.070
The last
York heir...
I'm aware.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.208
Your Grace.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.312
One day,
I'll be king.
He doesn't mean it.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.021
Our Uncle Richard
once thought Teddy
might be king but...

15:55.455 --> 15:58.025
Well...
Teddy isn't.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.228
Well, even Richard
changed his mind...

16:02.029 --> 16:03.096
But he remembers.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.502
We are just children.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.240
Do you swear allegiance
to me as your king?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.408
We do.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.879
And renounce your York claim
to the English throne?

16:20.047 --> 16:20.847
Yes.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.282
We do not want it.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.219
And Teddy doesn't either.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.255
Then he may say so
for himself.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.257
He...

16:33.126 --> 16:35.462
Teddy, tell the king
that you love him.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.408
What did you
say to your Uncle Richard?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.512
Long live the king!

17:00.420 --> 17:03.590
Your grandfather's lands
of Warwick and Salisbury
are confiscated,

17:05.425 --> 17:09.262
hereby given to Lord Thomas
and Lord William Stanley

17:09.362 --> 17:10.563
in reward for their fealty
at Bosworth.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.600
Thank you, Your Grace.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.779
Take no notice of
the dead king's mother.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.417
They will all
accept you,
given time.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.119
They will have to.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.353
With a York girl
by your side.

17:33.453 --> 17:37.157
A whore who lay
with my own enemy
before the battle.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.493
She has been
brought here, Henry.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.499
Well, what if I don't
choose to marry her?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.469
You made a promise
at Rennes Cathedral

17:50.737 --> 17:52.472
and raised your army
on that pledge.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.474
There are other York girls,
aren't there?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.143
Surely any one of them
would do as well?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.379
Meet her, Henry.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.248
There's no rush.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.349
A steady course.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.256
Uncle?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.250
Who is it to?

18:37.650 --> 18:38.885
They are awake.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.191
Who is it to?

18:45.192 --> 18:48.261
Jan Warbecque,
the boatman in Tournai.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.365
I bid your brother
go to him.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.566
We must pray
he got there.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.335
But how will you
deliver it?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.692
I forgot
my prayer book.
I'll go back and get it.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.228
Thank you.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.244
Uh, Your Grace.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.180
Your blood will wash
the stable floor

20:14.281 --> 20:16.283
if the new king sees you
bend your knee to me.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.651
You will always be
the Queen of England
in my eyes.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.353
You and the king
were very kind to me.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.722
And is this new king kind?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.528
Will you do my bidding, Ned?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.231
I would not ask
if it were
not important.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.071
You will need to pay
the messenger.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.576
Take this letter.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.312
Find an honest boatman
to deliver it.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.613
No one must know.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.652
When you have news,
send this to me...

21:01.394 --> 21:02.562
I will come
and find you.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.077
Lady Margaret.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.547
"My Lady, the King's
Mother" now.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.050
I am called "Your Grace"

21:24.951 --> 21:26.586
and I receive a royal bow.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.787
Indeed.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.525
And does it bring you the joy
you hoped it would?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.427
It is God's will.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.841
It is God who put
my Henry on the throne.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.378
And God who puts
my daughter

21:51.444 --> 21:53.212
on the other throne
beside him.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.682
She is not made
queen yet.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.787
We will call with you
this afternoon

22:00.887 --> 22:02.689
and if she
begs forgiveness
for her sins,

22:04.391 --> 22:06.393
perhaps, my son
will grant it.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.396
Lizzie does not beg
for anything,

22:10.963 --> 22:12.399
but you may try.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.984
Good day,
Princess Elizabeth.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.456
You will address the king!

23:10.690 --> 23:11.858
Good day, Your Grace.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.665
Some wine,
Your Grace?
Mmm.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.544
My other daughters...

23:31.644 --> 23:34.514
Cecily, Anne,
Catherine and
Bridget.

23:35.915 --> 23:36.983
Your Grace.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.921
My mother is arranging for
your allowance to be paid.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.026
Your service as my mother's
lady-in-waiting will never be
forgotten, Lady Margaret.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.730
"The meek shall inherit
the Earth."

23:50.830 --> 23:52.499
So the Bible tells us.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.838
Dance for me.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.521
No.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.524
Princess Cecily.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.527
I think, perhaps,
you have more grace.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.932
The girls can
dance together.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.269
My mother has decided
on a motto for you.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.610
"Humble and penitent."

25:45.912 --> 25:47.947
You would do well
to abide by it.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.626
I pray my brother brings
his challenge swiftly

25:59.726 --> 26:00.727
so I do not have to
marry him.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.995
He does not seem
to want to marry you.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.732
Of course he wants
to marry her.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.835
What man wouldn't?

26:12.639 --> 26:13.973
I will not marry her.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.077
There are a dozen
European princesses

26:18.177 --> 26:19.646
all of whom are chaste

26:19.712 --> 26:20.913
and would make
more obedient wives.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.515
But none of whom
will unite the
warring houses.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.852
The other
York girls would.

26:25.952 --> 26:26.919
Or Margaret Plantagenet.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.254
God knows
there's enough of them.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.122
But you have promised
that you will marry
Princess Elizabeth.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.792
If you refuse,
you will insult her

26:32.892 --> 26:34.894
and the Yorks
will rise up
in her defense.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.030
The Yorks can still
command England, Henry.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.132
Your pledge was to unite
the country

26:40.232 --> 26:42.869
which is why you have us
on your council.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.504
I can only tell you

26:45.672 --> 26:47.206
what the others
of our House will do

26:47.306 --> 26:50.943
and now they feel...
Um, forgive me,
Your Grace,

26:53.212 --> 26:56.582
that you are a Welshman
who's lived your life
in France

26:56.683 --> 26:58.084
and does not even
know our customs.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.056
Take another
as your mistress.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.192
Take anyone
you choose.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.560
But they insist
you marry
Princess Elizabeth

27:08.695 --> 27:10.129
as you have sworn to do.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.389
Henry?

27:47.934 --> 27:49.936
I have prayed upon this.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.943
Perhaps this is the sacrifice
that God would have you make.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.182
Jesus suffered in the desert
and when they crucified him.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.087
It is divine to suffer

28:10.322 --> 28:14.093
and you have more divinity
than any man on Earth.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.236
God asks for this,

28:26.839 --> 28:28.975
and in return,
he gives you England.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.028
Parliament have said
that he must marry you.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.164
I was right then, that
he does not want to.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.001
How do you know
that they have
said that?

29:06.278 --> 29:07.313
Princess Elizabeth?

29:08.580 --> 29:11.683
The king will see you in his
private rooms tonight alone.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.052
We are not married,
I cannot.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.854
My daughter thanks
His Grace

29:14.954 --> 29:16.322
and is delighted
to attend.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.460
Go, Lizzie.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.497
Perhaps you may yet
grow to like him.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.882
Your mother should be here
to chaperone you.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.052
Perhaps she learned
her disregard of
decency from you.

29:48.254 --> 29:51.323
Perhaps she knows
a chaperone is pointless,
in your case.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.724
Foolish to close
the stable door

29:52.859 --> 29:53.960
when the horse has
long since bolted.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.966
But that filly loved
her stolen freedom

30:00.066 --> 30:01.067
more than you could know.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.873
In fact, she spent herself
so fully on her gallop

30:06.973 --> 30:09.208
that its memory
would sustain her
until she died.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.713
Come with me.
What are you...

30:15.147 --> 30:16.348
Get off me!
Come.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.086
What are you doing?

30:22.889 --> 30:24.156
What are you doing?
Unlock the door!

30:26.058 --> 30:28.260
So, this is how
the King of England
behaves towards a lady?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.996
Towards a whore

30:30.096 --> 30:31.830
and you have said yourself
that's what you are.

30:31.931 --> 30:32.831
Well, if I
am a whore,

30:32.932 --> 30:34.166
you will not wish
to wed me, will you?

30:34.366 --> 30:35.801
I do not.

30:35.902 --> 30:36.768
With all my heart,
I don't.

30:36.969 --> 30:37.937
But I am told I must

30:38.037 --> 30:39.305
for England...
For yourself!

30:39.405 --> 30:41.440
They will not have you
for a king without me.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.343
My heir must have
some York blood

30:44.443 --> 30:46.245
in his veins,
as well as Tudor.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.147
And we will know
that you are fertile

30:48.247 --> 30:50.282
before you sit on
any throne beside me.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.350
"We!"

30:53.085 --> 30:54.386
Your mother bids you
to rape me?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.388
It isn't rape.
We shall be married.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.024
Only if I will have you!

30:59.091 --> 31:01.060
You think you have
a choice?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.294
You think you have
free will in this?

31:02.394 --> 31:03.795
I am the king
and I do not.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.501
Let's get it over then.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.171
Yeah?

31:48.174 --> 31:50.109
Have you finished?

31:56.115 --> 31:58.117
I barely even noticed.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.419
I thought about
your sister Cecily.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.188
It made it quick.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.338
Lizzie?

32:22.008 --> 32:23.209
Get out, Cecily.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.145
I said get out!

32:26.245 --> 32:27.713
Take the little ones.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.492
What is it?
What's happened?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.097
Oh, Maggie...

32:51.070 --> 32:53.039
He is a bad man, Maggie.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.044
A horrible bad man.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.279
Did he force you...

33:00.379 --> 33:01.380
No!

33:03.182 --> 33:05.251
No, he did not
take me.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.189
He has not won
this moment.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.290
He has not won.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.127
He will never beat me.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.288
Your Grace?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.462
I'm sorry
for my sister's
rudeness.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.500
I hope you see that I am

33:55.434 --> 33:56.568
not the same as she is.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.207
If you'd like for me to
dance for you again or...

34:07.313 --> 34:10.116
You should show
more loyalty
to your sister.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.824
We never planned much
after the battle.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.228
He's overwhelmed,
I think.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.265
He won the battle,
he has the crown.

34:26.365 --> 34:29.335
And he will keep it.
With our help.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.640
He wishes us
to set about his coronation.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.344
He thinks that
we should do it now

34:39.245 --> 34:42.248
to show England
that he is king alone,

34:42.348 --> 34:43.849
not joint ruler
with the girl.

34:46.352 --> 34:47.619
He hasn't mentioned it
to me.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.223
Margaret,

34:52.258 --> 34:56.495
in time, he will share
all his confidences with you.

34:57.829 --> 35:02.268
But it was Henry and I alone
for many years.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.170
He saw betrayals
from all sides,

35:04.203 --> 35:06.004
from those who claimed
to love him

35:06.205 --> 35:07.673
and all this is very new.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.178
I am his mother.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.515
I have given up
my life for him.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.350
And he will learn
to trust you.

35:23.655 --> 35:27.226
He will only marry her
if she conceives a child.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.930
Well, they are intimate
already?

35:32.664 --> 35:34.533
We have to know
if she's fertile.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.038
He's bid me
search the Tower

35:40.206 --> 35:41.607
for the bodies
of the York princes.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.243
While there's no proof
that they are dead,

35:44.343 --> 35:47.213
rumors persist
and fuel rebellions.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.452
I will do it.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.222
I need to earn his trust.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.262
Princess Elizabeth?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.663
This way.
Why?

36:31.357 --> 36:32.524
You are lucky in your looks,

36:34.326 --> 36:35.461
just like your mother.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.298
You will have
handsome children.

36:40.566 --> 36:43.435
I suppose you are still vain
in your appearance though.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.608
I wish to speak
to you as a friend.

36:53.279 --> 36:56.615
We continue to be at odds
with one another and...

36:59.418 --> 37:00.819
I regret it.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.826
I am to be
your mother-in-law

37:08.794 --> 37:12.464
and you will find
when you come to know me

37:12.564 --> 37:16.902
that I have
great love to give,

37:17.002 --> 37:19.771
and that I have
a talent for loyalty.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.009
When I was
a little girl...

37:26.378 --> 37:29.315
I was called upon
to give birth to Henry.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.319
Now, I knew he would be
King of England

37:33.385 --> 37:34.786
and I would put him
on the throne.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.791
When I met you,

37:41.527 --> 37:44.663
I knew that you had
a destiny to bear his son.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.767
That is why
I was hard on you,

37:50.702 --> 37:53.339
why I was so furious

37:53.372 --> 37:58.243
when I saw you straying
from your path

37:58.344 --> 38:00.546
and fighting
against your calling.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.482
You think I have
a calling?

38:04.716 --> 38:07.819
You will be mother
to the King of England.

38:10.556 --> 38:13.825
A boy who is the red rose

38:13.925 --> 38:15.727
and white combined.

38:18.364 --> 38:22.734
You will be the peace
that ends the cousins' war.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.607
And God himself
will call you blessed.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.617
You may now go
to my son's rooms
and do your duty.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.526
So, Lizzie has
a king to wed,

39:21.026 --> 39:22.694
but what about the rest of us?

39:22.961 --> 39:24.796
Who's king?
Is it me?

39:24.896 --> 39:26.432
No, Teddy.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.566
You mustn't say it.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.768
It isn't fair that
we are not invited
to the coronation.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.772
I'm sick to death of
being cooped up here.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.941
But what if they should
cheer for us?

39:36.041 --> 39:38.309
Londoners love
the House of York.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.245
They would call for Lizzie
and for Teddy, too.

39:40.646 --> 39:41.680
He cannot risk it.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.682
Our cousins are there,

39:43.782 --> 39:44.783
and Aunt Eliza.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.454
Well, they have turned
their coats to Tudor

39:48.487 --> 39:49.955
and he will want to
make a show of it.

40:19.017 --> 40:22.488
Please bleed. Bleed.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.378
A stable boy
brought this for you.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.080
He says
you dropped it.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.667
Maggie, would you
do something for me?

41:10.536 --> 41:12.771
I cannot go
as we are followed
by the "ladies."

41:14.072 --> 41:16.007
Would you get
some herbs for me?

41:16.107 --> 41:17.543
For my belly pain.

41:18.544 --> 41:19.645
What kind of pain?

41:20.612 --> 41:21.813
It's my monthly course.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.067
Do you have
news for me?

41:50.676 --> 41:51.810
"Dear Lady.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.946
"I wish that I could
give you joy about your jewel.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.182
"But I have not seen
nor heard of it,

41:57.282 --> 41:59.618
"although I have prayed
I would."

41:59.718 --> 42:00.686
Thank you.

42:04.122 --> 42:07.859
I... I went as well
to your home, Your Grace.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.600
And what did you
find there?

42:15.701 --> 42:16.835
Nothing.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.972
Everything that
once you had inside
is looted.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.641
Even doors have
been ripped off.

42:22.741 --> 42:23.709
Your servants gone.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.611
Your orchard's plundered.
There's...

42:26.812 --> 42:29.781
There's nothing. And...

42:32.050 --> 42:35.721
The soldiers who were there,
who came there to collect you,

42:36.622 --> 42:37.689
they were...

42:37.789 --> 42:40.626
They were told to slaughter
any boys they found there.

42:44.763 --> 42:45.864
And did they?

42:49.234 --> 42:50.969
I don't know.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.647
Who gave the order?

43:03.281 --> 43:05.717
My Lady,
the King's Mother.

43:44.155 --> 43:46.792
God save the king!

43:47.092 --> 43:49.127
God save the king.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.169
What have you got
there, Maggie?

43:59.337 --> 44:00.772
Oh.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.207
Lizzie asked me
to fetch it for her.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.075
For her belly pain.

44:18.924 --> 44:20.058
Maggie brought
this for you.

44:24.730 --> 44:25.864
Mandrake.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.068
I know two uses for it.

44:32.403 --> 44:34.940
One, to poison someone's
dreams. The other...

44:35.040 --> 44:36.975
To dislodge a baby
from my womb.

44:40.779 --> 44:43.548
All I have ever wanted,
all my life, is to marry
a man for love.

44:44.916 --> 44:47.886
You know, my Lizzie,
that girls of your nobility
cannot do that.

44:47.986 --> 44:49.220
You did.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.989
I had the good sense
to fall in love with
the King of England...

44:51.089 --> 44:52.257
And so did I.

44:54.259 --> 44:57.162
It should be Richard's child
in my belly...

44:57.262 --> 44:59.230
not this.

45:00.766 --> 45:02.033
But he is dead.

45:02.968 --> 45:06.872
That part of your life
is over now, Lizzie.

45:06.972 --> 45:10.175
And what is here
is Henry Tudor,
this child!

45:10.275 --> 45:12.177
A creature put inside me
by a monster.

45:12.277 --> 45:13.845
A baby.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.847
Your baby.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.082
My grandchild.

45:23.889 --> 45:26.024
I thought I might
outwit him.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.996
Make him hope to take another
for his bride, instead of me.

45:31.096 --> 45:35.834
But now...
Well, now I have no choice.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.170
Or only one...

45:41.907 --> 45:44.843
Because if I do not marry him,
yet have his child,

45:44.943 --> 45:48.847
I am shamed to everyone,

45:48.947 --> 45:51.149
and any other life for me
is gone in any case.

45:54.452 --> 45:57.122
The stable boy
brought news
from home.

45:59.858 --> 46:01.226
Lady Margaret
told the soldiers

46:01.326 --> 46:03.829
to murder any boy
they found there.

46:05.130 --> 46:07.598
And did they?

46:08.066 --> 46:09.067
Find him?

46:15.273 --> 46:17.008
There were no bodies.

46:20.345 --> 46:22.213
But neither is he
in Tournai.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.618
There are never any bodies.

46:28.053 --> 46:29.354
Can't you kill them both?

46:31.857 --> 46:33.959
Wish a sickness on them
so they'd die in awful pain?

46:34.059 --> 46:35.193
I cannot do that.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.964
I know, my "curses."

46:40.131 --> 46:43.034
But perhaps, they're
just wishful thinking.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.937
Perhaps I take good luck
and call it "magic."

46:47.138 --> 46:48.473
My powers
cannot be very strong

46:48.573 --> 46:50.008
if we find ourselves
as we are now,

46:50.108 --> 46:51.209
with my son lost again

46:52.277 --> 46:53.879
and this before us.

46:58.283 --> 47:01.152
Some say that
folk are sick

47:01.252 --> 47:03.421
along the route
the Tudor army
took through Wales.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.957
Perhaps they'll
bring about their
own destruction.

47:12.964 --> 47:17.468
I know one thing...

47:20.071 --> 47:22.240
You cannot
blame this baby boy.

47:24.109 --> 47:25.276
And if you have him,

47:25.476 --> 47:27.946
he will be ours,

47:28.046 --> 47:29.147
not Henry Tudor's,

47:31.016 --> 47:32.918
and we will make him strong

47:33.251 --> 47:34.920
and tall

47:34.986 --> 47:37.222
and our own rose of York.

47:43.929 --> 47:45.931
The choice is yours,
my Lizzie.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.009
But I will take
a piece of this.

48:02.113 --> 48:03.949
I have my own use
for it.

48:48.059 --> 48:49.294
Henry, a child!

48:49.394 --> 48:51.029
My grandson!

48:55.533 --> 48:56.567
Congratulations, Henry.

48:56.667 --> 48:58.436
Oh, God smiles on us.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.306
We must praise him
with a mass.

49:01.406 --> 49:02.473
With a wedding.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.242
I will not be
dishonored,

49:04.342 --> 49:05.443
so we must hold
a wedding quickly.

49:05.543 --> 49:06.911
We will arrange it.

49:07.012 --> 49:08.079
I share your joy,
Your Grace.

49:08.679 --> 49:10.115
We will name him Arthur

49:10.215 --> 49:11.482
and christen him
in Winchester.

49:11.582 --> 49:12.917
You need do nothing.

49:13.018 --> 49:14.152
Except consent.
And look delighted.

49:14.252 --> 49:15.853
England needs
a joyful bride.

49:16.221 --> 49:18.489
All else will be
arranged by me.

49:19.157 --> 49:20.291
No.

49:23.594 --> 49:25.330
No, I will choose
the dress myself.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.265
Of course.

49:33.138 --> 49:34.239
Elizabeth?

49:41.646 --> 49:44.049
At last, you bring
good news.

49:45.650 --> 49:49.154
Perhaps, we may yet join as
friends in our new grandson.

49:50.388 --> 49:51.489
Perhaps.

50:32.197 --> 50:34.099
I know
that you were looking

50:34.199 --> 50:36.167
for their bodies in the Tower.

50:41.172 --> 50:42.640
But even if
you found the bones,

50:45.310 --> 50:47.445
you'd only find one prince.

50:50.581 --> 50:53.484
Because I swapped the other
for a servant boy.

51:26.517 --> 51:29.387
My mother and my sister
cursed you for my murder.

51:29.687 --> 51:32.223
The male line of
your family will die.

51:33.691 --> 51:38.396
My York Prince Richard
will come against your son.

51:39.797 --> 51:43.434
One lives, Lady Margaret.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.507
You have won the
people, Henry.

52:23.308 --> 52:25.210
And with this marriage,
they will love you.

52:26.711 --> 52:28.446
And you already
have an heir.

52:29.780 --> 52:31.349
There is one
matter...

52:32.583 --> 52:36.221
God has shown me that
you must relieve her
of her mother,

52:37.455 --> 52:39.490
or she will poison
the girl against you.

52:41.492 --> 52:42.427
Once your son
is born,

52:42.527 --> 52:44.495
you must imprison
Elizabeth.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.233
It is God's will.

52:54.439 --> 52:55.606
Today, you will marry a king.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.408
In a dress fit for a harlot.

52:58.276 --> 52:59.610
Today, I am a whore
and a martyr,

52:59.710 --> 53:01.479
because that is what
he has made me.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.349
They will simply think
it's red for Lancaster

53:04.449 --> 53:05.516
and you are
being loyal.

53:07.285 --> 53:10.455
Walk through your sorrow,
my daughter,

53:10.555 --> 53:12.257
and you will end up
where you want to be.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.592
I will walk through
my sorrow

53:14.692 --> 53:15.826
and I will smile
through my pain.

53:18.263 --> 53:19.530
I will pretend to
be a dutiful wife,

53:19.630 --> 53:20.731
but only to their faces.

53:23.334 --> 53:25.603
He is my enemy
and so is his mother.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.806
I will fight them
from within my marriage

53:28.906 --> 53:30.641
and they will
not even know it.

53:32.777 --> 53:37.315
I will plot to bring
my brother back,
or, if he is gone,

53:37.415 --> 53:39.584
another who will kill
this monster Henry Tudor.

53:42.953 --> 53:44.822
"Humble and penitent"
may be damned.

53:48.426 --> 53:50.295
"Hidden and patient."

53:52.363 --> 53:54.299
That will be my motto.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.516
*

56:06.063 --> 56:08.633
You're not afraid?

56:08.833 --> 56:10.868
I approach you with a dagger
and you do not even flinch?

56:11.636 --> 56:13.438
My life is gone, in any case.

56:14.605 --> 56:15.906
Give me your foot.

56:20.778 --> 56:22.513
Ah. Ow.

56:24.048 --> 56:26.717
It's for your reputation.

56:26.817 --> 56:28.453
So my son
is not a bastard.

56:34.892 --> 56:35.960
Sleep.

56:58.549 --> 57:00.485
"Hidden and patient."

57:03.821 --> 57:04.855
**

57:05.690 --> 57:07.692
*

58:02.647 --> 58:03.814
**
