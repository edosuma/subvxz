01:36.708 --> 01:40.308
Defending champion Beau Brandenburg
wins the first race of the season.

01:45.988 --> 01:48.855
The big story at Miami's Grand Prix
is the second-place finish...

01:49.628 --> 01:50.828
...of rookie Jimmy Bly.

01:53.387 --> 01:55.221
-Where's he from?
-Racing's new heartthrob.

01:58.707 --> 02:00.674
-Second place in England.
-A contender.

02:02.828 --> 02:03.661
Bly is a natural.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.234
We're in Rio for race six.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.728
A surprise win for rookie
Jimmy Bly.

02:13.028 --> 02:14.661
Brandenburg's first season loss.

02:15.187 --> 02:17.587
A second incredible upset.
Bly wins in Michigan.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.300
Brandenburg loses.

02:20.987 --> 02:22.854
We're down under for the 11th race.

02:24.907 --> 02:26.507
Brandenburg's lost three in a row.

02:28.507 --> 02:30.641
Bly and Brandenburg are tied
for the championship.

02:32.747 --> 02:33.747
Bly looks nervous.

02:34.107 --> 02:36.274
-Cracks are showing.
-Part of being a rookie.

02:36.866 --> 02:40.067
It'll be interesting to see how long
this young man can keep this up.

03:21.305 --> 03:24.372
Hey, DeMille, you promised
a sound bite for tonight's sports!

03:25.266 --> 03:27.566
Jimmy, only talk to this woman.
This reporter only.

03:50.065 --> 03:51.866
DeMille, can we call it?

03:52.745 --> 03:54.312
Wait a minute. Come here.

03:55.066 --> 03:56.666
Think. Let me explain something.

03:57.185 --> 04:00.852
These people love you and buy tickets.
The ones with cameras help sell them.

04:01.785 --> 04:03.552
-l need to focus on tomorrow.
-lt is tomorrow.

04:04.265 --> 04:05.465
This is part of the game.

04:05.825 --> 04:08.525
ln five years, when you're
a brand name, you'll thank me.

04:47.384 --> 04:50.084
Beau, you've had problems before
and never acted like this.

04:51.784 --> 04:52.851
Things change.

04:53.704 --> 04:55.638
Why can't you just respect
what l need?

04:58.624 --> 05:00.357
A bad season, so l'm
out of your life?

05:00.904 --> 05:01.970
This is my life!

05:02.664 --> 05:04.464
This is not your life!

05:07.623 --> 05:09.190
This is what you do for a living.

05:10.624 --> 05:13.924
Look, if l'm going to win...

05:14.904 --> 05:18.571
...l need my mind there, not here.
Right now this is my life.

05:21.543 --> 05:22.710
This is your life.

05:28.263 --> 05:29.530
What am l?

05:34.543 --> 05:35.610
What am l?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.663
A distraction.

05:40.782 --> 05:41.882
l'm sorry.

06:26.222 --> 06:28.189
We're in lap 193
of this 225-lap race.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.589
The defending world champion,
Beau Brandenburg, is in first...

06:32.382 --> 06:35.582
...driving better than we've
seen him drive all season long.

06:36.861 --> 06:39.395
Christian Fittipaldi
sits in second place.

06:40.741 --> 06:43.275
And the young rookie, Jimmy Bly,
sits back in third.

06:43.981 --> 06:45.881
Bly's been shaky
for the last few races.

06:46.502 --> 06:48.835
He's such a promising star,
just got raw talent.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.641
If Carl Henry could
get him to relax...

06:53.901 --> 06:56.034
...there'll be no stopping him.

06:57.621 --> 06:59.921
Laps wind down.
It's a tight panel at the front.

07:03.141 --> 07:05.974
Bly tries to make his move
on the number 11 of Fittipaldi.

07:06.781 --> 07:08.748
Motorola car comes to the inside.

07:13.820 --> 07:16.054
And he does it!
Sweet pass by the rookie, Bly.

07:16.660 --> 07:17.927
Great. You're doing great.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.835
Close on Brandenburg?
Everybody wants to know that.

07:22.781 --> 07:26.415
Bly really seems to be having a
problem with consistency and focus.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.914
Even so, he now finds himself
in second place.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.781
With just 10 laps to go,
Brandenburg leads.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.420
You're looking good.
Right there.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.474
Brandenburg's experience shows.
He knows how to take the corners.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.094
Jimmy Bly coming into the corner
has a tendency to slow down.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.967
-A lot of pressure on young Bly.
-Pass for chrissake!

07:52.779 --> 07:53.913
What is he afraid of?

07:54.380 --> 07:56.813
Follow Brandenburg's line.
Are you following his line?

07:57.700 --> 07:59.633
I can't. Can I pick another line?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.646
Take Brandenburg's line.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.333
Bly drafts up into the vacuum
behind Brandenburg's car.

08:06.099 --> 08:09.266
But every time he steps out of that
vacuum he runs into a wall of air.

08:10.099 --> 08:13.533
-Slows him down and affects momentum.
-Lay it out, Jimmy. Lay it out.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.533
You better win this thing.
Win it or you'll look like a fool.

08:20.579 --> 08:23.180
Bly down to the inside,
tries to get alongside him!

08:23.899 --> 08:26.200
Very, very close as they
come off the corner.

08:37.578 --> 08:40.179
Can Bly get past him here?
It's gonna be close.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.573
Son of a bitch, not again.
He's gone.

08:44.499 --> 08:46.966
Bly makes his move,
nails the throttle.

08:49.698 --> 08:51.265
They touch and Bly's in trouble!

08:51.739 --> 08:54.206
Can he keep it off the wall?
He slides to the inside.

08:54.898 --> 08:57.565
Bly's spinning out of control.

09:13.818 --> 09:14.985
Damn it!

09:15.499 --> 09:18.332
And it gives the win over
to the defending world champion.

09:19.218 --> 09:22.052
This is Beau Brandenburg's day.

09:26.578 --> 09:29.245
This is Beau Brandenburg's
first victory in three races.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.244
He's gotta be happy.

09:31.698 --> 09:35.198
Brandenburg's back in the lead in
the race for the world championship.

09:40.818 --> 09:43.185
Crusher, it's time
to call Joe Tanto.

10:14.217 --> 10:15.050
Hello?

10:17.097 --> 10:19.197
You'll never be up before me,
old friend.

10:21.217 --> 10:22.284
How you doing, Carl?

10:24.097 --> 10:24.797
l was just...

10:25.936 --> 10:27.103
...feeling nostalgic.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.563
You still there?

10:30.977 --> 10:34.011
-Can you push it to the ragged edge?
-Yeah, l think so.

10:34.816 --> 10:36.616
-And the fear?
-lt's gone.

10:37.416 --> 10:39.650
-Fear's never gone.
-Yeah, maybe.

10:42.736 --> 10:44.736
-What about Memo?
-I'm making a change.

10:45.376 --> 10:47.476
Memo's out, you're in.

10:48.096 --> 10:49.763
You're driving for me again, Joseph.

10:50.295 --> 10:51.929
Welcome back to the big show.

11:00.135 --> 11:01.035
What is it, Jimmy?

11:01.815 --> 11:04.116
Because this bad thing
is coming at a bad time.

11:05.176 --> 11:07.143
-So talk to me.
-l said, it's nothing.

11:07.975 --> 11:09.342
What am l, a piece of wood?

11:10.856 --> 11:13.022
-l'm talking to you!
-Look, l can't do this.

11:13.655 --> 11:16.355
l can't handle it.
l'm being pulled in 10 directions.

11:17.255 --> 11:19.556
l thought l could handle it,
but l can't.

11:20.175 --> 11:22.075
You can, and you will.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.249
l don't care, we deal with it.
Okay?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.876
Then stop pushing
like you're one of them.

11:28.495 --> 11:30.362
Wait. ''Them''?

11:31.575 --> 11:33.242
Like l'm the enemy? ''Them''?

11:35.975 --> 11:37.275
That's great. That's....

11:39.455 --> 11:42.189
Ever since you started kicking my ass
on everything with wheels...

11:42.935 --> 11:45.635
...it's been us. My brother
has the touch, l don't. Fine.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.282
But what l do have
is allegiance to you.

11:48.815 --> 11:50.582
So don't doubt me. Don't do that.

11:52.894 --> 11:55.961
l saw this 8-year-old,
goofy-looking kid...

11:56.735 --> 12:00.435
...on a piece of junk go-cart,
come from three laps behind...

12:01.414 --> 12:02.914
...to beat guys twice his age.

12:04.695 --> 12:06.695
You rebounded then, right?

12:07.295 --> 12:08.628
We'll rebound now.

12:09.374 --> 12:11.874
Everybody trips. That's okay.
That's life.

12:12.535 --> 12:14.302
lt's how fast you get up that counts.

12:15.534 --> 12:16.834
So get up, Jimmy.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.521
But get up fast.

12:42.173 --> 12:45.440
We just got word from Carl Henry
that Joe ''The Hummer'' Tanto...

12:46.253 --> 12:47.554
... will replace Memo Moreno...

12:49.933 --> 12:50.900
...as Bly's teammate.

13:24.093 --> 13:25.060
Excuse me.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.239
How about an autograph, cold fish?

13:28.892 --> 13:31.626
-What are you doing here, Joe?
-Glad to see you're still warm.

13:32.373 --> 13:34.240
They figured you needed
some competition.

13:35.172 --> 13:36.939
Now there's a familiar face.
Sophia!

13:37.692 --> 13:38.893
Don't call her, please.

13:39.892 --> 13:40.625
What's wrong?

13:42.092 --> 13:43.593
-Joe--
-Still working here, huh?

13:44.092 --> 13:46.726
-We haven't seen you in a long time.
-No, no, no.

13:47.453 --> 13:48.953
You keeping him under control?

13:49.452 --> 13:51.886
-You driving?
-Yeah, back with Carl Henry's team.

13:52.572 --> 13:54.072
-Wow.
-Yeah.

13:54.532 --> 13:55.566
That's great.

13:57.972 --> 13:58.906
Well....

14:01.892 --> 14:03.359
l'll see you around, Joe.

14:06.492 --> 14:09.225
-She wants to kill you. What happened?
-Nothing.

14:09.932 --> 14:10.765
Nothing?

14:11.132 --> 14:13.132
Why'd they put you in a car again?

14:13.691 --> 14:15.125
All you do is get in the way.

14:15.612 --> 14:17.979
-Somebody thinks l got something left.
-Somebody?

14:18.612 --> 14:19.645
-Yeah.
-What do you think?

14:20.052 --> 14:21.352
l think it's will over skill.

14:21.971 --> 14:24.138
Will over skill?
Like Detroit in '97?

14:25.451 --> 14:27.452
-Accidents happen.
-Accidents?

14:28.651 --> 14:29.751
You almost killed me.

14:30.171 --> 14:33.071
You know, Beau, l'm just
glad l'm back. l really am.

14:35.851 --> 14:37.784
-l'm different now.
-You...

14:38.412 --> 14:39.812
...will never be different.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.058
Be seeing you in my rear-view, Joe.

14:44.491 --> 14:45.691
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.217
Please, picture. Please.

14:48.811 --> 14:49.944
Picture? No problem.

14:53.130 --> 14:54.831
You gotta be kidding, right?

14:59.410 --> 15:00.310
Smile.

15:03.251 --> 15:04.184
How you doing, guys?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.737
-Joseph.
-Carl.

15:06.931 --> 15:08.531
l want you to meet our sponsors.

15:09.211 --> 15:10.678
You've been gone a while, Joe.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.370
Not really. Been up north
testing cars for us.

15:13.971 --> 15:15.438
Shouldn't he wear our hat?

15:17.130 --> 15:18.864
lt's a little damp, isn't it?

15:19.450 --> 15:20.417
-Just kidding.
-l'm sorry.

15:20.810 --> 15:22.877
-This is Lucretia Jones.
-Hi.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.323
-How you doing?
-Call me ''Luc.''

15:25.890 --> 15:27.424
Luc? l think l can remember that.

15:27.930 --> 15:30.164
She's a journalist and will
be with us all season.

15:30.811 --> 15:33.277
She's doing an exposé
on male dominance in sport.

15:33.930 --> 15:36.463
-Will you have time to talk?
-Gotta ask the legend.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.704
-Whatever he wants.
-For a beautiful lady, of course.

15:40.730 --> 15:43.264
-No speeding tickets, Joseph?
-No, no speeding tickets.

15:43.930 --> 15:45.163
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.410
-Nice to meet you.
-See you later, Luc.

15:47.970 --> 15:49.670
Give him hell, Joe.

15:50.890 --> 15:52.823
l thought Tanto was dead,
for chrissake.

15:55.530 --> 15:56.630
Whoa!

15:58.009 --> 15:59.343
Now that ex-wife of yours...

16:00.129 --> 16:01.629
...that's a piece of work.

16:02.569 --> 16:05.536
Divorces you and marries
a fellow driver.

16:06.409 --> 16:08.343
l'm realizing how much
l didn't miss you.

16:08.889 --> 16:10.289
-You missed me.
-Next subject.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.703
l got a rookie driver. His name
is Jimmy Bly. He's won five races.

16:14.530 --> 16:16.296
He's starting to find ways to stumble.

16:16.849 --> 16:18.949
l'm not losing that lead.
lt won't happen.

16:19.569 --> 16:22.403
-Memo drives great. What happened?
-Memo forgot his damn job.

16:23.129 --> 16:26.896
His job is to support the team.
To support Jimmy Bly. So he's gone.

16:27.849 --> 16:30.182
l could've hired 100 young turks
to take his place...

16:30.809 --> 16:32.775
...but l wanted somebody
who's been to the top...

16:33.408 --> 16:36.575
-...and stumbled down to the bottom.
-Thanks for reminding me.

16:37.448 --> 16:40.249
l wanted somebody that
gets his attention.

16:40.968 --> 16:42.335
-Maybe gains his trust.
-Why?

16:42.849 --> 16:44.616
Because you're gonna help him...

16:45.449 --> 16:48.082
-...my old friend.
-Carl.

16:49.849 --> 16:52.616
Let's get something straight.
l thought you wanted me to race.

16:53.408 --> 16:54.541
No.

16:55.088 --> 16:56.288
-l'm gone.
-No, you're not.

16:56.688 --> 16:58.989
l'm not finished yet. We go back.

17:00.968 --> 17:02.469
We go way back.

17:03.009 --> 17:06.276
l carried you for six years.
You owe me, Joe.

17:08.407 --> 17:10.108
All you gotta do is help this kid.

17:10.647 --> 17:12.548
Who knows? You might enjoy it.

17:13.127 --> 17:14.861
You got one offer on the table.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.508
Your choice.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.068
-What did you give him?
-Gas money.

17:38.607 --> 17:41.874
There are a hundred guys more
qualified to back Jimmy. Why him?

17:42.767 --> 17:45.968
Because when he's on, he's
one of the best you'll ever see.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.000
Just sit back and watch.

17:56.887 --> 17:57.754
What's he doing?

17:59.367 --> 18:01.901
He's just wound up.
Doing his coin bit will relax him.

18:04.207 --> 18:06.740
-What's his coin bit?
-He'll hold a slide...

18:07.486 --> 18:09.887
...going full out, then go over
to pick up three coins.

18:11.847 --> 18:14.014
Not with the front tire,
any fool can do that.

18:14.647 --> 18:17.247
He'll snatch them up with
the back one and not lose speed.

18:18.007 --> 18:20.240
-There's no way.
-You don't want to bet me.

18:37.726 --> 18:38.993
There's number one.

18:50.245 --> 18:51.079
There's number two.

18:57.605 --> 18:58.572
What's that sound?

19:01.205 --> 19:03.339
-lt sounds like humming.
-Yep.

19:04.005 --> 19:04.838
Why is he humming?

19:05.526 --> 19:08.526
Some crazy thing he does
when he's pushing close to the edge.

19:09.525 --> 19:12.026
-Anyone else ever do that?
-Not among the living.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.465
-Want to back off, Joe?
-Let him go.

19:29.004 --> 19:30.671
Let's see if he's still got it.

19:46.444 --> 19:49.378
You passed the audition, and l'm not
mopping up the mess, Hummer.

20:00.644 --> 20:01.977
Not bad, Hummer.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.911
-Your humming's getting better.
-Let me drive again?

20:15.604 --> 20:18.004
l said your humming,
not your driving.

20:20.124 --> 20:21.490
Go talk to the kid.

20:28.244 --> 20:29.644
How you doing? l'm Joe.

20:30.124 --> 20:32.057
-Nice run out there.
-lt was okay.

20:33.843 --> 20:36.010
Hey, listen, l liked Memo.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.804
He's a good guy, good driver.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.497
Just so you know.
We didn't have any problems.

20:45.683 --> 20:46.950
Two out of three, huh?

20:49.483 --> 20:53.750
Why don't you and me grab a cup
of coffee and talk some strategy?

20:55.443 --> 20:58.410
The strategy's simple: He drives,
you block. You block, he wins.

20:59.203 --> 21:01.069
We gotta hit it.
We got a publicity blitz.

21:01.643 --> 21:02.677
Can't we push that back?

21:03.082 --> 21:05.082
Come on, it's part of the contract.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.270
Talk to you later.

21:07.722 --> 21:10.323
Just channel through me, okay?
l channel well.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.216
Appreciate that.

21:19.002 --> 21:20.269
Car coming down.

21:31.362 --> 21:34.163
Last week's big news was Jimmy Bly's
close brush with the wall.

21:34.922 --> 21:37.956
Bly was trailing Beau Brandenburg
on turn four of the last lap...

21:38.763 --> 21:41.063
... when he lost control
at over 200 miles an hour.

21:41.682 --> 21:44.049
I don't know what's going on
with Bly's driving.

21:44.681 --> 21:47.782
It went so well earlier in the season,
surprising everyone.

21:48.601 --> 21:50.768
He can't seem to
get it together on the track.

21:51.441 --> 21:54.442
All eyes will be on Bly
at tomorrow's Toronto Grand Prix....

22:37.601 --> 22:40.568
So, Luc, what have you learned
since you've been here?

22:41.441 --> 22:44.108
-l used to think you just put gas in--
-Fuel.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.841
-Get it right.
-Fuel. l knew that.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.947
Put the fuel in and push the pedal...

22:51.481 --> 22:52.414
...and that was it.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.154
That is embarrassing,
that's what that is.

22:55.761 --> 22:57.727
Joe, with only 10 races
left in the season...

22:58.361 --> 23:00.361
...why'd they get you?
What makes you special?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.527
Oh, special l'm not.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.387
Do you feel awkward being back?

23:09.280 --> 23:13.047
-Something you're not telling me?
-Well, rumor has it you...

23:13.960 --> 23:15.460
...were the circuit's wild man.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.587
You married a woman named Cathy.

23:18.079 --> 23:20.246
You cleaned up, stopped
living the old lifestyle...

23:20.840 --> 23:22.440
...things didn't work out.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.933
-lnteresting, if it weren't me.
-lt's just what l heard.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.573
-l don't want to upset you.
-Game's over.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.667
You actually have something to say.
These young drivers have barely lived.

23:34.919 --> 23:36.753
Your life is so colorful
by comparison.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.227
You know, Luc, l wouldn't remind
you what a fool you've been...

23:40.959 --> 23:44.193
...and then insult you
by calling it colorful.

23:48.799 --> 23:51.999
-l'm sorry.
-So don't judge me until you know me.

23:53.199 --> 23:56.133
-How do l do that?
-By finishing this game, wiseass.

23:57.758 --> 24:00.159
Wiseass? Right.

24:00.999 --> 24:01.832
Good luck.

24:15.039 --> 24:15.772
Hi.

24:17.039 --> 24:17.805
Hi.

24:20.558 --> 24:22.992
-So.
-So.

24:25.758 --> 24:28.358
l heard about you and Beau.
And l'm sorry.

24:30.078 --> 24:31.179
Thanks.

24:32.278 --> 24:33.645
lt's my problem.

24:34.118 --> 24:35.985
l'm sorry, Sophia.
l didn't mean to...

24:36.519 --> 24:37.919
...get into your business.

24:40.918 --> 24:41.918
l'm trying to talk.

24:45.078 --> 24:47.345
l just came out of
a three-year relationship.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.092
-That's a long time.
-Yeah, it's a long time.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.025
When you get used to someone,
it's not....

24:57.238 --> 24:58.272
l don't know.

25:00.638 --> 25:01.838
What?

25:06.718 --> 25:08.685
-l shouldn't be here.
-Wait. No.

25:09.277 --> 25:12.244
-l shouldn't be doing this.
-Sophia, please.

25:13.797 --> 25:14.564
Stay.

25:22.637 --> 25:24.204
l'm not looking to get involved.

25:25.437 --> 25:27.171
l'm not over him.

25:27.677 --> 25:30.178
l understand that.
l'm just looking for a friend.

25:31.157 --> 25:32.190
You sure?

25:33.756 --> 25:35.723
-Yeah. l think so.
-Think?

25:39.916 --> 25:42.083
Do you want to go sit down,
talk for a while?

25:43.836 --> 25:46.037
Yeah. Yeah, l would.

25:50.277 --> 25:53.577
Welcome to Toronto, Canada,
and this year's Toronto Molson Indy...

25:54.477 --> 25:56.710
...and ESPN's live coverage
of this race.

25:57.396 --> 25:59.230
-Hi, l'm Jeff Oaken.
-l'm Dave Wershafter.

25:59.797 --> 26:02.930
...and this is race day
beside the lake.

26:05.196 --> 26:06.063
Because it is time.

26:06.876 --> 26:09.043
All the qualifying
and practicing is done...

26:09.636 --> 26:12.770
...it's time to play the cards
and see how it goes down.

26:28.556 --> 26:30.789
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome today's drivers:

26:31.475 --> 26:32.842
Max Papis, Joe Tanto...

26:34.036 --> 26:35.836
...Jimmy Bly, Beau Brandenburg....

26:37.195 --> 26:39.296
This race is being watched
by millions...

26:39.876 --> 26:41.343
...from Finland to Australia.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.369
Over 250,000 people expected
here in Toronto alone...

26:46.115 --> 26:48.949
...from across the world.
110-lap race on a street track.

26:49.716 --> 26:51.816
A lot of different styles,
but the street track...

26:52.475 --> 26:54.809
...is considered as being
the most hazardous.

26:55.516 --> 26:58.349
That's because it takes place
on ordinary city streets.

26:59.115 --> 27:02.849
You guys here in Toronto
should be the loudest folks to cheer.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.449
Well, well, well.

27:06.795 --> 27:08.761
So, what about me?

27:10.075 --> 27:11.575
How do l look?

27:12.035 --> 27:14.535
Or do you still hate answering
loaded questions?

27:16.235 --> 27:17.802
Go ahead, ask me.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.788
-You love him?
-l love a lot of things.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.448
-Why marry him?
-He's a younger, better you.

27:25.235 --> 27:26.068
Ouch.

27:26.875 --> 27:28.641
-You want to know more?
-No.

27:29.674 --> 27:32.341
You left me.
With nothing, l might add.

27:33.075 --> 27:37.342
Just as Memo and l are starting to
get something here, you steal his job.

27:38.434 --> 27:40.334
And he still likes you.
How pathetic is that?

27:40.914 --> 27:43.181
l don't understand this
''brotherhood of speed'' crap.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.375
Just answer me one question.

27:46.074 --> 27:49.341
Does hurting me make you feel better,
or does that come naturally?

27:55.994 --> 27:59.227
You think you were better than me.
You weren't.

28:04.393 --> 28:05.460
Hey.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.880
-Joe.
-Memo.

28:11.393 --> 28:13.293
Hey, did Cathy say anything bad?

28:13.873 --> 28:16.773
She better not. Look at you.
How you been, good? Huh?

28:17.553 --> 28:19.087
Listen, l'm sorry about all this.

28:19.553 --> 28:21.620
Somebody had to do it,
why not an old friend?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.467
That makes it even worse.

28:24.193 --> 28:26.993
-You never called about our wedding.
-No, l didn't.

28:27.753 --> 28:29.920
Hey, friends don't do that.

28:30.554 --> 28:33.120
lf they have problems, they talk.
We always did that.

28:33.793 --> 28:35.860
Sometimes good things happen
from bad ones.

28:36.952 --> 28:38.586
But, if it'd make you happy...

28:39.073 --> 28:41.173
-...l'll divorce her.
-Memo, what are you doing?

28:41.952 --> 28:44.253
Right now, right here, today.
l'm divorced.

28:45.793 --> 28:47.526
But only if you marry me.

28:48.033 --> 28:51.166
-Get out. Come on.
-Please. You know, l get so lonely.

28:51.993 --> 28:53.827
Yeah, you look like you're lonely.

28:55.153 --> 28:58.486
l just want to enjoy my life.
My real life...

28:59.713 --> 29:01.113
...not this one.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.033
And Cathy does that for me.

29:03.953 --> 29:07.286
Amigo, l have to go. Show these
maricas what a real driver can do.

29:08.152 --> 29:09.419
-l'll do my best.
-Okay.

29:09.872 --> 29:10.573
Bye.

29:17.912 --> 29:18.879
Sophia!

29:20.072 --> 29:21.072
Where are you going?

29:23.192 --> 29:24.558
Good luck today, Beau.

29:25.032 --> 29:27.432
Everyone excited to see how
Joe Tanto does today.

29:28.151 --> 29:30.485
His first race since
he nearly lost his life.

29:31.152 --> 29:34.119
-Stop bothering people, wiseass.
-Don't mess with me.

29:36.152 --> 29:37.752
The season's rookie leader, Bly.

29:38.272 --> 29:41.872
It'll be interesting to see if this
young man can handle the pressure.

29:42.912 --> 29:44.445
-What's she doing here?
-lt's all right.

29:44.911 --> 29:45.978
No, this is not all right.

29:46.431 --> 29:48.931
Brandenburg's whatever
enters your life by accident?

29:49.631 --> 29:52.131
-''Whatever''? Hi, l'm Sophia.
-That's your problem.

29:52.792 --> 29:53.992
DeMille, come on.

29:54.871 --> 29:57.371
Weren't you being pulled
in too many directions?

29:58.431 --> 30:01.098
-Man.
-That'll make more legroom for us.

30:01.831 --> 30:04.964
We're ready in Toronto. Time for
the big one to get underway.

30:05.791 --> 30:07.525
Working your way down the track?

30:09.270 --> 30:11.837
Brandenburg is on the pole
first again.

30:12.991 --> 30:15.158
As you have heard,
we are ever so close.

30:28.791 --> 30:31.224
-We have five minutes to race time.
-Joseph.

30:32.150 --> 30:33.917
Gentlemen, to your cars.

30:40.150 --> 30:42.184
Hey, Jimmy. Good luck, man.

30:43.710 --> 30:44.477
Thanks, man.

30:45.390 --> 30:47.224
All the racers down in pit lane now...

30:47.791 --> 30:50.958
...are in the final stages
of getting ready for this race.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.397
Pace cars are standing by.

30:57.269 --> 31:00.270
We are almost underway
here in Toronto.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.450
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready for racing?

31:21.229 --> 31:22.929
Gentlemen, start your engines.

31:47.988 --> 31:51.122
Starting today's race from
the pole position, Beau Brandenburg.

31:52.508 --> 31:55.009
Second qualifier, Dario Franchitti.

31:55.669 --> 31:57.336
Third, Christian Fittipaldi.

31:57.868 --> 32:01.736
They're warming their tires to desired
temperature for better traction.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.842
This is the first
of four warm-up laps.

32:06.068 --> 32:08.502
All eyes on the green flag
ready for it to drop.

32:09.189 --> 32:11.189
Sixteenth, Joe Tanto.

32:18.388 --> 32:19.488
The race is underway!

32:19.869 --> 32:22.502
They roar toward the first turn,
a right-hander, a treacherous gate.

32:23.628 --> 32:25.528
They funnel down into that corner.

32:34.228 --> 32:36.528
The second passing opportunity
lies just ahead.

32:37.187 --> 32:39.988
Someone's in trouble!
Two cars sideways, the Visteon car!

32:40.747 --> 32:43.848
Right through the barrier!
He's flipping up end over end!

32:44.667 --> 32:47.101
The Visteon car in big trouble!

32:52.908 --> 32:54.975
An incredible accident!

32:56.828 --> 32:58.295
This puts us at
a full course yellow.

32:58.787 --> 33:02.054
It'll give the drivers a chance
for their first pit stops of the day.

33:03.907 --> 33:07.174
One of the strategies to this game
is when to bring your man in.

33:12.867 --> 33:17.034
An extra second in the pits can cost
a driver a place or two in this race.

33:28.187 --> 33:31.420
There goes Brandenburg.
Bly, and Tanto is out.

33:32.467 --> 33:35.300
All three with very fast pit stops,
just over 12 seconds.

33:36.027 --> 33:39.660
As Andretti and Tracy almost
get together on the exit!

33:40.946 --> 33:43.980
But now Brandenburg's in front,
Jimmy Bly in second.

33:45.146 --> 33:47.480
l want you to go after Brandenburg.
Go right now. Go!

33:48.147 --> 33:51.447
We have some really interesting
driving by Bly behind Brandenburg.

33:52.346 --> 33:55.746
-l can't find a hole.
-Don't look for a hole. Make a hole.

33:56.586 --> 33:59.053
Back to full speed,
Bly in pursuit of Brandenburg.

33:59.626 --> 34:02.093
He's right there.
He tries him at every corner.

34:09.426 --> 34:11.626
Jimmy, you got 10 laps to go.
Conserve the tires.

34:12.266 --> 34:14.498
You talk into that again,
l'll make you eat it.

34:15.106 --> 34:17.306
Don't conserve anything. Go get him.

34:19.585 --> 34:22.619
If he's gonna overtake Brandenburg,
it'll happen in Turn 3.

34:23.466 --> 34:24.666
And it's right--

34:25.065 --> 34:27.032
Oh, look at that!

34:29.545 --> 34:30.779
What a way to move!

34:31.185 --> 34:34.518
Jimmy Bly grabs the lead away
from Brandenburg. It's magical.

34:35.385 --> 34:37.485
And Jimmy Bly has just taken the lead!

34:38.065 --> 34:39.297
-Joe.
-Yeah?

34:39.706 --> 34:40.572
l want you to pit now.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.545
Why? l don't need to pit, Carl.

34:43.225 --> 34:44.391
l want you to pit.

34:44.864 --> 34:48.465
In a very unusual move, Carl Henry
has just called Tanto into the pits.

34:49.424 --> 34:51.091
He hit the marks.

34:51.585 --> 34:53.752
l know what you're doing, Carl.
lt's wrong.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.225
They're changing the tires, refueling.

34:56.824 --> 34:59.692
I see no movement on the chassis,
no wing adjustments.

35:00.464 --> 35:03.198
l'm not asking you to like this, Joe.
Just work with me.

35:07.185 --> 35:09.885
In the meantime, the veteran
Brandenburg behind Bly.

35:10.585 --> 35:14.718
That's gotta worry the young rookie.
One mistake, that's all it'll take.

35:16.104 --> 35:19.004
-Hold. Hold, Joseph, hold.
-Come on, come on, damn!

35:24.424 --> 35:26.224
Come on, Carl, let me out of here!

35:28.584 --> 35:30.618
Bly in front, Brandenburg second.

35:31.224 --> 35:32.591
Carl, l can't hold him off.

35:36.184 --> 35:38.684
Now, Joe. Go get that son of a bitch.

35:40.383 --> 35:42.850
They release Tanto,
and he roars out of the pit!

35:43.544 --> 35:46.044
I don't know what
Carl Henry and his team were thinking.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.644
Tanto's making a very fast exit
from the pit. Look at this!

35:50.463 --> 35:54.197
Tanto slices in between
Bly and Brandenburg!

35:55.583 --> 35:57.650
The officials aren't gonna
like that one.

35:58.504 --> 36:01.938
Tanto has to allow Brandenburg
to pass him after a move like that.

36:04.103 --> 36:05.703
One lap to go now.

36:08.983 --> 36:12.517
It's Bly and Brandenburg battling
it out in the last half-mile.

36:18.064 --> 36:19.864
Brandenburg tries to the inside!

36:21.223 --> 36:24.023
They come off the turn neck and neck.
Who's it gonna be?

36:25.422 --> 36:28.289
And here they come!
The checkered flag is out!

36:31.623 --> 36:33.923
It's Jimmy Bly,
the winner of this race!

36:35.742 --> 36:38.976
As they go around the track,
the checkered flag is flown, and....

36:39.863 --> 36:41.630
Very good strategy, Carl. Thank you.

36:42.183 --> 36:44.616
What a battle between
Jimmy Bly, Beau Brandenburg.

36:45.342 --> 36:48.176
This time, the young rookie
took it to the veteran.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.236
You did all right today, Joseph.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.116
Don't ask me to do that again.

37:10.942 --> 37:14.475
Jimmy, after four lackluster
performances, is Jimmy Bly back?

37:15.502 --> 37:16.435
Well, l hope so.

37:22.022 --> 37:25.122
Everyone falls down.
lt's just how fast you get up, right?

37:27.022 --> 37:29.722
Beau, the win could be
called controversial.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.735
-Well, a win is a win.
-So you won't protest?

37:33.581 --> 37:37.448
No, but l will have some lunch.
Anyone wants to join me?

37:41.061 --> 37:42.028
Thank you.

37:43.181 --> 37:45.114
Enjoy. This won't happen again.

38:06.421 --> 38:07.654
Jimmy, want to talk later?

38:08.060 --> 38:11.494
lf he wants to talk, he'll be
talking to me, okay? Come on.

38:16.700 --> 38:20.434
Know how much you'll be worth if
you win? They'll buy you in sections.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.847
Your eyes to a sunglass company,
your arm to a watch company.

38:24.540 --> 38:27.740
Your foot to a shoe company. Or maybe
you'd like to keep some parts.

38:28.541 --> 38:31.441
-Come on, he just finished racing.
-Hey, you're not here.

38:32.220 --> 38:33.586
-DeMille.
-What?

38:34.380 --> 38:35.613
What's so wrong with what she said?

38:37.260 --> 38:38.227
Nothing.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.287
Nothing.

39:39.418 --> 39:40.518
What are you doing?

39:43.019 --> 39:44.319
-Swimming.
-Swimming?

39:44.978 --> 39:47.478
That's swimming to you, huh?
l don't think that's swimming.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.545
That's a little beyond.

39:51.378 --> 39:52.611
l've never seen anything like that.

39:53.538 --> 39:56.305
Pretty fantastic.
Where'd you learn how to do that?

40:00.538 --> 40:03.272
-l was raised by frogs.
-Raised by frogs?

40:10.698 --> 40:13.364
-Well, l'm glad you escaped.
-Oh, thank you.

40:15.498 --> 40:17.331
Jimmy, what's on your mind?

40:21.178 --> 40:23.511
-How does Beau do it?
-Do what?

40:24.577 --> 40:27.178
Stay on top. Stay focused.

40:29.577 --> 40:30.811
He drives scared.

40:32.257 --> 40:34.424
No, l don't think so.
That guy is ice.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.725
To you, he's ice. lnside he's scared.

40:39.377 --> 40:42.044
But he likes it.
He says it makes him try harder.

40:44.017 --> 40:46.517
He says the day he's not afraid
is the day he'll stop.

40:48.057 --> 40:50.724
You're just as good.
And the day you stop caring...

40:51.497 --> 40:55.031
...what other people think and make
yourself happy, you'll be even better.

40:59.417 --> 41:00.350
Come on.

41:14.177 --> 41:16.110
Don't you ever stop running,
cold fish?

41:16.696 --> 41:18.963
Block me again
and l'll put you into the wall.

41:19.576 --> 41:21.443
Well, that's not gonna happen again.

41:22.817 --> 41:23.750
Believe me.

41:25.256 --> 41:27.356
-What are you trying to prove?
-Got nothing to prove.

41:27.976 --> 41:32.176
No, you proved you could do very
little with very much. Forget it.

41:33.216 --> 41:35.350
Why do l waste my time
talking to this guy?

41:35.936 --> 41:38.170
Because no one else
likes your arrogant ass.

41:40.056 --> 41:42.556
-So that's it.
-That's it. Mystery solved.

41:45.576 --> 41:48.110
While you're in this good mood,
do yourself a favor.

41:48.815 --> 41:50.682
-What?
-Take her back if she wants you.

41:51.336 --> 41:53.736
Stay out of my business, Joe.
What are you doing?

41:54.416 --> 41:56.549
l'm just talking.
You do want her back, right?

41:57.575 --> 41:58.675
Why do you care?

41:59.015 --> 42:01.982
You two have a lot of history.
That doesn't go away so fast.

42:02.776 --> 42:05.409
-l pushed her away, Joe.
-But you weren't thinking right.

42:06.576 --> 42:08.209
l wasn't thinking at all.

42:10.216 --> 42:12.916
You know, it's really hard when--

42:14.055 --> 42:15.322
When l see her with him.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.109
And l did it, you know?

42:18.855 --> 42:21.255
lt was me. l'm responsible for it.

42:23.056 --> 42:25.022
You wanted to win no matter the cost.

42:25.575 --> 42:28.408
-You want me to talk to her?
-No, Joe, don't do that.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.388
You don't want either of us
to talk to her?

42:33.455 --> 42:34.689
That's just great.

42:41.214 --> 42:43.848
Hey, Beau, if this is about pride,
you better forget it.

42:44.575 --> 42:48.108
-That's how the whole thing started.
-What would you do?

42:48.975 --> 42:51.408
Me? To get someone back
that l really love?

42:52.055 --> 42:53.655
Get that rock out of my stomach?
Crawl.

42:54.175 --> 42:55.708
-You'd crawl?
-Crawl.

42:56.215 --> 42:59.348
-You never crawl.
-l'd crawl till there's nothing left.

43:00.814 --> 43:02.715
Come on, champ. Use your head.

43:36.653 --> 43:37.853
Welcome to ESPN's coverage...

43:38.333 --> 43:40.733
...of the Twin Rings Race
qualifying section.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.847
And we're live
from the Japan Motor Speedway...

43:44.493 --> 43:47.327
...in front of 120,000
spectators today.

43:48.093 --> 43:51.060
Open wheel racing,
a very popular sport in Japan.

43:52.333 --> 43:55.167
One day to the event,
and it's been a great day so far.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.427
You should ask Jimmy how it is
to have the best manager.

44:00.053 --> 44:03.287
With the final run just completed,
the top five best times were:

44:04.132 --> 44:07.699
Brandenburg, Andretti, Gugelmin,
Montoya and Fittipaldi.

44:08.613 --> 44:12.013
An interesting sideline: This year's
rookie point leader, Jimmy Bly...

44:12.893 --> 44:15.227
...only managing a tie
for 10th place.

44:18.653 --> 44:22.086
Relax, dude, don't shove.
Hey, don't shove. We're friends.

44:22.933 --> 44:25.199
Jimmy! Jimmy, why 10th today?

44:28.372 --> 44:30.206
How come this never happens to me?

44:31.853 --> 44:32.619
All right!

45:10.732 --> 45:13.065
-You seem preoccupied.
-l'm thinking about Jimmy.

45:13.731 --> 45:16.898
You know, Carl thinks he can't cut it.
l think he can. lt's just--

45:17.732 --> 45:19.965
lt's tough to get close
to this kid. lt is.

45:20.572 --> 45:23.839
l think Carl cares more about
helping you than helping Jimmy.

45:24.691 --> 45:27.558
-You're way off.
-l can see in the way he looks at you.

45:28.331 --> 45:31.765
l mean, with Jimmy it's business.
With you, it's personal.

46:53.930 --> 46:57.397
Keep it steady, Jimmy.
Keep your eyes out of the mirror.

47:04.569 --> 47:08.769
With a steady drive, Beau Brandenburg
has managed to catch up to Jimmy Bly.

47:09.809 --> 47:13.810
The veteran working both sides,
doing all he can to make Bly nervous.

47:14.808 --> 47:16.808
Don't let him intimidate you.

47:20.929 --> 47:22.529
l don't know if l can do this.

47:23.529 --> 47:27.529
-You should talk less and drive more.
-Looking great, Jimmy.

47:29.088 --> 47:32.289
Brandenburg knows every inch
of this racetrack.

47:33.088 --> 47:35.622
He moves inside of Bly,
lets him know he's there.

47:37.488 --> 47:38.688
Let's take him down.

47:40.529 --> 47:43.029
Now it looks like he's gonna try
him on the outside.

47:48.488 --> 47:49.855
They're neck and neck!

47:52.528 --> 47:54.428
He gets by!
Brandenburg is in the lead.

47:55.008 --> 47:57.541
That's some incredible driving
by Beau Brandenburg.

47:59.408 --> 48:02.908
Bly's teammate, Tanto, got Bly to
the front of the pack earlier today.

48:03.968 --> 48:06.102
Jimmy, don't let him get to you.
Shake it off.

48:10.008 --> 48:12.408
-l'll get it back. l can get it back.
-Stay on him.

48:13.088 --> 48:15.555
Now we'll see if Bly has learned
through this season.

48:16.247 --> 48:18.581
Can he come back and regain the lead?

48:20.847 --> 48:23.547
-Bly will try it on the high side.
-Don't overdrive the car.

48:24.807 --> 48:27.641
-The suspension's getting loose.
-Bly is looking everywhere:

48:28.447 --> 48:31.214
Inside, outside, high, low,
just nowhere to go.

48:31.927 --> 48:33.494
Don't overdrive the car.

48:34.007 --> 48:37.341
The rear is drifting.
Jimmy, keep it steady.

48:40.647 --> 48:42.047
Don't overdrive the car.

48:48.607 --> 48:50.140
Don't overdrive the car.

48:52.366 --> 48:54.967
They're in the final lap.
This is it. Final turn.

48:55.647 --> 48:59.347
Bly still all over the place.
He's coming up around, going high.

49:00.326 --> 49:02.427
Bly's in trouble!
Bly's in serious trouble!

49:03.046 --> 49:06.347
He's off to the gray stuff!
Oh, he slams into the wall!

49:13.646 --> 49:15.080
Oh, my God!

49:36.445 --> 49:38.146
Are you okay, Jimmy?

49:38.805 --> 49:42.072
Safety trucks are rolling.
The crowd on its feet, silent.

49:50.166 --> 49:53.333
We all await word on the fate
of rookie driver Jimmy Bly.

50:07.965 --> 50:11.232
They pull him out from under the car.
He gives the crowd a wave.

50:12.085 --> 50:15.319
Jimmy Bly, after that
awesome accident, is all right.

50:16.165 --> 50:18.298
And the crowd responds to it.

50:20.644 --> 50:21.411
What a waste.

50:35.484 --> 50:38.318
It's my pleasure to welcome you
to glimpse into the future...

50:41.365 --> 50:43.865
...and the 1000 horsepower
extreme machines...

50:44.565 --> 50:46.398
...that'll race us
into the millennium.

50:46.925 --> 50:50.258
Kindly join me in welcoming
the power and the glory.

51:00.484 --> 51:04.284
Well, Joe. Now what part of formal
didn't you understand?

51:05.244 --> 51:06.377
Wait a minute.

51:07.923 --> 51:11.224
Oh, my mistake, yeah.
l'm gonna go get a drink.

51:12.083 --> 51:13.584
-You look very nice.
-Thank you.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.483
-Hey, rebel.
-Yeah.

51:15.964 --> 51:16.897
What you got there?

51:17.244 --> 51:19.377
lt's something l want
to give Jimmy later.

51:20.204 --> 51:22.204
Be selective who you spend time with.

51:22.763 --> 51:25.230
Extend yourself.
These people make everything happen.

51:25.924 --> 51:28.057
-He's right.
-You'll stay around, right?

51:28.603 --> 51:29.737
l'll be around.

51:31.244 --> 51:33.010
You do know your way around,
don't you?

51:33.563 --> 51:36.063
-l like your brother.
-l liked him first.

51:36.763 --> 51:39.797
-DeMille?
-Nina. Exactly who l wanted to see.

51:40.723 --> 51:43.190
-You look fantastic.
-Thank you.

51:43.963 --> 51:48.030
Earlier today you said that Jimmy
has to find it off the track.

51:49.243 --> 51:51.577
-What'd you mean?
-Here we go with the questions.

51:52.643 --> 51:53.609
Gotta find that quiet spot.

51:54.003 --> 51:56.970
lf your mind's not right,
you will get torn apart.

51:58.042 --> 52:01.176
So you better buckle up.
lt's gonna be a bumpy ride.

52:03.323 --> 52:05.823
l can't believe that line still works.

52:08.522 --> 52:11.589
Now this is either very
unprofessional, or naive...

52:12.442 --> 52:15.143
...or she swallowed your bullshit
and loved the taste.

52:15.882 --> 52:18.949
-Where's Memo?
-Replacing you. Working his way down.

52:19.802 --> 52:23.203
Joe, if you don't get it by midnight,
you're probably not gonna get it.

52:24.522 --> 52:26.989
And even if you do,
l don't think it'll be worth it.

52:29.482 --> 52:30.915
Just an observation.

52:41.362 --> 52:42.362
Excuse me.

52:43.522 --> 52:44.722
You make any new friends?

52:45.162 --> 52:48.295
Like these people want to talk to me.
When the season's over....

52:49.082 --> 52:51.215
-What?
-l was thinking...

52:51.802 --> 52:54.669
...maybe we could go someplace.
l've never even had a vacation.

52:56.241 --> 52:57.841
-Never?
-Never.

53:00.161 --> 53:02.461
No pressure, all right?
Just think about it.

53:04.121 --> 53:05.421
Two minutes, please?

53:10.161 --> 53:11.595
What a coincidence.

53:15.001 --> 53:17.501
ls this a little experiment
for you or something?

53:18.401 --> 53:20.701
Dark chapter you can tell
your friends about?

53:22.481 --> 53:24.514
Maybe you like being manhandled.

53:25.481 --> 53:26.748
That l can understand.

53:27.201 --> 53:29.901
But it's the being dumped part
that's kind of a drag.

53:32.241 --> 53:34.675
So you were just used and abused?

53:35.840 --> 53:37.440
Was that attitude?

53:39.001 --> 53:40.834
Saucy. Good for you.

53:44.640 --> 53:47.707
And next time l'm around, look at him.
He ain't over it.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.667
Your mascara's running.

53:55.241 --> 53:56.474
That's cute.

53:58.801 --> 54:00.234
Stupid bitch.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.040
-So, are you two enjoying the evening?
-l'll wait over there.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.480
lf you win a championship,
what would you do first?

54:08.519 --> 54:09.920
l don't know, really.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.106
You've had some peaks
and valleys over the season.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.374
What have you learned?

54:15.960 --> 54:18.494
What have you learned
that you never realized before?

54:19.160 --> 54:21.227
-That it's another world.
-Where air is rare.

54:21.840 --> 54:24.473
Your team can take it all
with a strong show in Germany.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.133
How do you prepare
for something like--?

54:27.719 --> 54:31.986
There you have it, James Bly obviously
very pensive about the upcoming race.

54:33.079 --> 54:34.513
-Yeah, well--
-What's happening?

54:35.359 --> 54:37.193
-What's it look like?
-Jimmy.

54:37.759 --> 54:40.193
-You came with me.
-Maybe she'll leave with you...

54:40.879 --> 54:43.146
...but what l have to say
you don't need to hear.

54:43.759 --> 54:46.359
Just let him talk.
lt doesn't mean anything.

54:47.039 --> 54:50.239
-Yes, it does mean something.
-What, Beau? What does it mean?

54:52.598 --> 54:54.632
We should probably just go.
Sophia, let's go.

54:55.239 --> 54:57.005
-Don't do that.
-Don't do what?

54:57.559 --> 55:00.359
-That's none of your business.
-Come on. What's going on?

55:01.119 --> 55:03.153
-lt's nothing, DeMille.
-Back off.

55:06.439 --> 55:08.539
Come with me for a second.
Can l talk to you?

55:09.159 --> 55:11.559
-You're doing this all wrong.
-l know.

55:12.638 --> 55:13.872
l do everything wrong.

55:14.359 --> 55:16.659
-Excuse us.
-l can't believe this is happening.

55:18.718 --> 55:21.018
l don't want to spend
more time away from you.

55:22.878 --> 55:24.178
l miss you.

55:26.798 --> 55:27.932
l miss you too.

55:29.919 --> 55:32.252
-Really?
-Yeah.

55:33.117 --> 55:37.351
Do not go over there. Trust me.
Jimmy, please. Calm down, calm down.

55:38.398 --> 55:42.032
Don't blow this. Not over her.
This is not eighth-grade prom.

55:42.957 --> 55:44.957
How you act,
these things are important.

55:45.758 --> 55:47.491
-Jesus Christ!
-He's giving her a ring.

55:48.038 --> 55:49.772
-That's not good.
-Please take it back.

55:50.358 --> 55:53.925
Whatever it is, you can deal
with it later. This is not the time.

55:55.478 --> 55:56.944
Just work with me on this.

55:57.477 --> 55:58.478
Jimmy.

56:02.397 --> 56:03.697
l'm so sorry.

56:04.957 --> 56:07.091
Go. Just go.

56:09.477 --> 56:10.444
l don't--

56:11.398 --> 56:13.064
-Let me explain it to you.
-Hey, you need--

56:14.838 --> 56:15.571
Get away from me.

56:15.877 --> 56:17.478
-Play somewhere else.
-Just listen.

56:17.957 --> 56:19.257
-Five minutes.
-Go away!

56:19.717 --> 56:21.283
-Jimmy.
-Don't push me, don't push me.

56:21.757 --> 56:22.824
-Go.
-Fine, fine, okay!

56:23.237 --> 56:25.471
-Play your game somewhere else.
-Get the hell away from me.

56:41.876 --> 56:43.276
Move, move, move! Move!

58:06.795 --> 58:07.628
l need backup!

58:11.435 --> 58:12.202
Pull over!

58:12.914 --> 58:14.181
Come on, Jimmy, pull over!

59:50.872 --> 59:52.272
Get away from me, man. Just--

59:52.753 --> 59:53.753
You want to go through me? Come on.

59:54.432 --> 59:55.432
l want to fight him.

59:55.792 --> 59:56.592
-For what?
-For what?

59:56.952 --> 59:57.752
You weren't there?

59:58.112 --> 01:00:00.045
What do you think he did,
take your woman away?

01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:01.926
Why did l let him take her away?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.032
She was gone.
She was always gonna leave.

01:00:04.552 --> 01:00:05.586
What do you know anyway?

01:00:05.992 --> 01:00:07.692
Your brother puts so much
pressure on you...

01:00:08.232 --> 01:00:10.166
...you looked for an edge.
You figured she was it.

01:00:10.752 --> 01:00:12.086
Why do you act like you care?

01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:14.152
l'm just a thing to you,
part of the job.

01:00:14.632 --> 01:00:17.466
You pick up a check to help me out
since you didn't help yourself.

01:00:18.392 --> 01:00:19.658
Why does that make you better?

01:00:20.112 --> 01:00:21.445
lt doesn't.
Why did you take the car?

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:22.905
l don't need to be pushed.

01:00:23.351 --> 01:00:24.685
-Go on, say it.
-Forget this.

01:00:25.151 --> 01:00:28.285
You hoped this would get you thrown
out. You're looking for the exit.

01:00:29.112 --> 01:00:30.345
What are you talking about?

01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:32.592
You don't know who you are anymore!

01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:35.732
You think you've got to be perfect
or you're a failure.

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:38.965
Well, forget that. Just forget it.

01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:53.005
l was gonna give this to you
before all this went down.

01:00:53.912 --> 01:00:55.012
lmpressive, isn't it?

01:00:58.871 --> 01:01:01.205
-What is it?
-lt's the first thing l ever won.

01:01:01.871 --> 01:01:04.371
lt was probably the last time
l ever felt pure victory.

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.137
No pressure, nobody breathing
down my back.

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:09.311
Just driving because l loved it.
Pure.

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:12.731
That's where you've gotta get back to.
Doing it naturally, for you.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:16.104
l don't have your gift, but l do
have some things you don't have.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:19.490
l got will and l got faith.
Don't laugh, l'm serious.

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:23.850
l believe that you can will yourself
into anything and do anything.

01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:26.824
Having faith, that's like
believing in--

01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:29.924
That's like having a good disease,
it's contagious.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.050
Hang with people that have it,
you're gonna catch it.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.383
That'll change your attitude.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.810
And winning is an attitude.

01:01:38.831 --> 01:01:40.497
So if you trust me--
No, if you trust yourself...

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.464
...by this season's end,
you'll be on top or you won't.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:47.177
But l guarantee you're gonna know
what Jimmy Bly is made of.

01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:02.809
Outside Chicago,
at the chicane it goes up...

01:02:03.389 --> 01:02:05.590
...and comes down right where you
got Brandenburg--

01:02:06.229 --> 01:02:07.429
ls that when l dip down?

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:10.217
Forget it.

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:13.270
l'm tired of these spoons.
We play with spoons.

01:02:13.949 --> 01:02:15.716
-Say ''ah.''
-Ah.

01:02:16.229 --> 01:02:17.630
Welcome to Germany.
Home of beer...

01:02:19.189 --> 01:02:20.889
...the Autobahn and Beau Brandenburg.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.056
-Qualifying begins tomorrow.
-With two races left...

01:02:25.669 --> 01:02:28.469
...Beau is leading in the race
for the world championship.

01:02:29.629 --> 01:02:30.796
Jimmy Bly is in second.

01:02:31.229 --> 01:02:34.762
Commissioner Gilson has slapped
Bly and teammate, Joe Tanto...

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.436
... with a $25,000 fine...

01:02:37.989 --> 01:02:40.589
...for their recent joyride
through downtown Chicago.

01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:56.389
Doing great, Jimmy.
Keep pushing that speed.

01:03:00.988 --> 01:03:01.822
Hey.

01:03:02.308 --> 01:03:03.742
You don't need to talk to me anymore?

01:03:04.228 --> 01:03:06.662
-lt's not like that.
-Really? What is it like?

01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:10.815
All right, here you go. Jimmy.

01:03:53.707 --> 01:03:54.474
Three, two.

01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:56.347
One. Beautiful.
Come on, buddy.

01:03:58.827 --> 01:04:01.361
Now, is he a hero, or is it hype?
What do you think?

01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:03.520
What do you want me to say?

01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:04.747
l want to hear what you think!

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.340
Jimmy just needs time
to develop, that's all.

01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:10.521
When he can get it together off
the track, he will on it.

01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:12.493
That's what l think.

01:04:13.506 --> 01:04:14.407
Like you got it together?

01:04:15.347 --> 01:04:17.614
You can help the kid off
the track more than on it.

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:21.000
You're not racing on Sunday.
l'm bringing Memo back.

01:04:23.586 --> 01:04:25.286
Come here.
Joseph, over here.

01:04:26.987 --> 01:04:27.820
Sit.

01:04:28.627 --> 01:04:29.360
At my level.

01:04:31.546 --> 01:04:33.080
lt's the moment of truth, my friend.

01:04:34.506 --> 01:04:36.940
lf he doesn't deliver
next time out, he goes.

01:04:39.586 --> 01:04:41.086
Don't hate me, but you go with him.

01:04:42.906 --> 01:04:44.406
I'll come around here in Turn 7.

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:47.493
Driving off Brandenburg,
l'll fake outside.

01:04:48.146 --> 01:04:49.446
Eight's a tough place to pass.

01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:50.839
l'm gonna carry that speed...

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.867
...bring it down the straightaway.
l have plenty of speed.

01:04:54.626 --> 01:04:55.459
Kind of flawless.

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:57.893
You're not even paying attention.
Watch this.

01:04:58.546 --> 01:04:59.912
Show me again.

01:05:15.385 --> 01:05:16.252
Yes, sir.

01:05:16.665 --> 01:05:20.065
lf you find yourself in a position
to hold up traffic, do it.

01:05:21.225 --> 01:05:22.559
l don't want any front-running.

01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:24.819
You know the drill.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:34.912
-Don't hurt yourself.
-l told you and l told you too.

01:05:37.865 --> 01:05:39.298
-What?
-l told you l'll return.

01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:41.118
Here l am, returned.

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.491
Like the real Zorro.

01:05:44.264 --> 01:05:46.465
There's no helmet big enough
to hold that head.

01:05:47.145 --> 01:05:48.378
There's so much love in here.

01:05:48.825 --> 01:05:50.458
You keep smiling,
your face is gonna crack.

01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:55.858
Why shouldn't he smile?
He's got a lot to be happy about.

01:05:56.624 --> 01:05:58.125
He's back where he belongs.
Right, baby?

01:05:58.945 --> 01:05:59.778
Yep.

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:02.198
Good?

01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:03.864
Hey, you're so good.

01:06:04.385 --> 01:06:05.918
You win this, yeah?

01:06:06.505 --> 01:06:07.771
You're gonna win.

01:06:09.224 --> 01:06:11.291
-Be safe, all right?
-You too, be safe.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:36.310
This is the second to last race
of the season.

01:06:36.983 --> 01:06:39.250
And what an exciting one
it promises to be.

01:06:44.263 --> 01:06:45.397
Clouds are all around.

01:06:45.824 --> 01:06:48.757
It looks like a thunderstorm
maybe a mile from the track.

01:06:49.544 --> 01:06:51.044
The rain threat hasn't dampened...

01:06:51.544 --> 01:06:53.944
...the spirits of this crowd
here in Germany.

01:07:00.063 --> 01:07:00.830
What do you want?

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:03.964
Wanted to apologize.

01:07:05.023 --> 01:07:06.623
Apologize to yourself.

01:07:07.743 --> 01:07:08.843
Let's race.

01:07:20.823 --> 01:07:22.957
l want you to stay in your world
and don't get into his.

01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:25.543
You push him hard.
You get him thinking about you.

01:07:27.103 --> 01:07:28.603
And you're not thinking about him.

01:07:29.142 --> 01:07:29.909
Got it.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:44.483
The skies are opening up
as the warm-up lap begins.

01:07:57.502 --> 01:07:58.402
How's Jimmy?

01:07:58.782 --> 01:07:59.582
He's all there.

01:08:14.462 --> 01:08:16.295
We are racing in Germany.

01:08:16.901 --> 01:08:19.600
Beau Brandenburg is starting
in the pole position today.

01:08:27.662 --> 01:08:29.429
Jimmy Bly is in second.

01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.429
Brandenburg moves out in front
on a course you can race in the rain.

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:37.140
Brake tires are on
and they are at speed.

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:43.255
Memo Moreno is back, giving
Jimmy Bly help as his teammate.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.501
I'm sure Memo wants to make
his presence felt today.

01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:49.361
Boy, he is on the fly.

01:08:49.741 --> 01:08:51.441
It's like he has something to prove.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:52.987
Good move, Memo.

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.581
Keep it steady.

01:08:56.661 --> 01:08:58.627
Somebody wants their job back.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:02.394
I think Joe Tanto may want
to watch his back.

01:09:07.701 --> 01:09:08.767
Somebody's spinning!

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.321
Kenny Brack, he's in trouble.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.800
He's gonna go way back
in the field on that one.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.367
Back at the front
the battle continues.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.800
Look at Brandenburg.
He cuts off Bly!

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.633
-He tried to take me out.
-Detach it. Hold your line.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.846
Ride his blind spot.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.087
I will, Joe,
but I can't see a damn thing.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.000
Neither can he.
Just patience, my man. Patience.

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:55.293
Take him, Jimmy! Take him!

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.133
Jimmy Bly in second place.

01:09:58.579 --> 01:10:00.346
Putting the pressure
on Beau Brandenburg.

01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:05.786
Push it.

01:10:08.499 --> 01:10:09.399
Here we go.

01:10:12.219 --> 01:10:14.452
Bly is gonna try to make
a move in the corner...

01:10:15.139 --> 01:10:17.073
...on Brandenburg on the outside.
He does it!

01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:19.066
Bly takes the lead.

01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:21.719
Goddamn brilliant.

01:10:23.179 --> 01:10:25.213
Car in trouble, spinning
on the wet pavement.

01:10:25.779 --> 01:10:28.112
-Looks like Gidley.
-Oh, here comes Max Papis!

01:10:29.378 --> 01:10:30.445
Crash!

01:10:31.819 --> 01:10:35.086
Head-on into that car!
Max Papis is airborne.

01:10:44.738 --> 01:10:48.105
lf he takes it to the inside,
don't follow him, he's setting you up.

01:10:49.418 --> 01:10:51.318
In the hairpin, that fight
for the lead continues.

01:10:51.978 --> 01:10:53.212
Jimmy Bly has the lead now.

01:10:53.698 --> 01:10:55.665
Brandenburg wants it back.

01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:01.578
Brandenburg goes to the high side.

01:11:02.418 --> 01:11:03.518
He gets by!

01:11:04.018 --> 01:11:05.151
Brandenburg back to the lead.

01:11:06.978 --> 01:11:08.311
Keep cool, he's putting on a show.

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:09.631
lt's a hell of a show.

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:11.984
Yeah, hell of a show.

01:11:12.777 --> 01:11:15.744
Now Memo Moreno whips out
of the pack and passes Andretti.

01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:19.371
He's really trying to get up there
with Brandenburg and Bly.

01:11:20.178 --> 01:11:21.044
Memo, what are you doing?

01:11:21.498 --> 01:11:22.498
l can almost touch him.

01:11:22.977 --> 01:11:24.177
Hold your position.

01:11:24.657 --> 01:11:25.458
Why? He's can win this.

01:11:26.458 --> 01:11:28.991
I'm sure Carl Henry is not
too happy with Moreno.

01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:31.798
Now Bly wants to make a move.

01:11:32.457 --> 01:11:34.057
Hold on, Memo Moreno
trying to make...

01:11:34.617 --> 01:11:36.984
...the same move on Jimmy Bly,
his teammate.

01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:39.657
Memo, no passing. Do you hear me?

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:41.363
l'm right there, Carl.

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:44.597
Lift off. Steady.
What are you doing?

01:11:45.617 --> 01:11:47.684
Moreno appears to have something
to prove here.

01:11:48.377 --> 01:11:49.811
He gets alongside Bly again.

01:11:50.377 --> 01:11:51.377
Damn it, we went over this!

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:52.824
Lift off!

01:11:54.657 --> 01:11:56.324
Lift off! You work for me.
l said, lift off.

01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:58.484
Why don't you let him drive?
Come on, baby.

01:11:59.096 --> 01:12:00.763
-Come on. Come on. Come on!
-Shut up!

01:12:04.416 --> 01:12:05.216
l've got to do this.

01:12:05.616 --> 01:12:07.883
With his teammate in the battle
for the championship...

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:10.904
...Moreno decided to stick
his nose into this fight.

01:12:11.617 --> 01:12:12.450
Hey, Memo, back off.

01:12:12.776 --> 01:12:14.677
Only inches separate
these two cars.

01:12:15.336 --> 01:12:16.069
Memo, you're too close.

01:13:04.136 --> 01:13:05.936
What's going on here?
Bly is spinning.

01:13:06.895 --> 01:13:09.729
He gets it under control.
He's going backwards on the track.

01:13:10.735 --> 01:13:11.635
Jimmy, what are you doing?

01:13:13.374 --> 01:13:14.741
Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?

01:13:34.095 --> 01:13:34.995
Memo?

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.534
Get out! Oh, God!

01:13:53.214 --> 01:13:54.514
We're getting chopper pictures.

01:13:55.054 --> 01:13:58.355
This is horrible.
The car is upside down.

01:13:59.254 --> 01:14:01.987
It's in a body of water.
Moreno is pinned underwater.

01:14:07.934 --> 01:14:09.200
lt's okay, Memo. l'm here.

01:14:09.694 --> 01:14:12.394
Beau, Memo crashed.
Jimmy went after him. You gotta help.

01:14:13.174 --> 01:14:14.441
He went into the river at Turn 5.

01:14:14.934 --> 01:14:17.201
l'll get you out, Memo.
lt's gonna be okay.

01:14:21.173 --> 01:14:23.140
-l'm on my way.
-Beau, what are you gonna do?

01:14:23.734 --> 01:14:24.867
Please be careful.

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:27.927
Oh, God! My foot!

01:14:29.694 --> 01:14:30.794
Oh, come on.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.800
Hang on, Memo! Hang on!

01:14:34.693 --> 01:14:36.026
-Help me!
-Get out!

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.240
-Help me!
-Get out, now!

01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:41.553
lt's gonna blow up!

01:14:43.773 --> 01:14:44.707
Hurry!

01:14:50.813 --> 01:14:53.646
We've got Bly and Brandenburg
to help a man in trouble.

01:14:54.693 --> 01:14:57.127
Rescue teams are on the way,
but the remote location...

01:14:57.773 --> 01:14:59.940
...of this crash makes
it difficult to reach them.

01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:03.206
Lift it up, higher. Lift it!

01:15:08.093 --> 01:15:10.427
Take a breath, Memo.
Come on. We're here.

01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:12.613
We're gonna get you out.

01:15:14.693 --> 01:15:15.859
Now!

01:15:16.493 --> 01:15:17.560
Come on. One, two....

01:15:20.413 --> 01:15:22.180
Get it over. Memo!

01:15:23.013 --> 01:15:24.113
We got you, Memo.

01:15:25.892 --> 01:15:27.492
-Come on, Memo.
-l can't move my leg!

01:15:28.532 --> 01:15:29.299
Come on.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:30.692
lt's gonna be okay.

01:15:31.132 --> 01:15:31.899
Fuel everywhere.

01:15:32.332 --> 01:15:35.066
They better get that driver
out of there and themselves too.

01:15:35.812 --> 01:15:39.079
That fuel could ignite,
it could be floating on the water.

01:15:43.692 --> 01:15:44.758
Come on!

01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:47.705
Hurry up!

01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:12.998
That is horrifying.

01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:14.858
I've never seen anything like that.

01:16:15.412 --> 01:16:17.145
It's unbelievable.

01:16:17.892 --> 01:16:20.925
Worried about the well-being
of another driver, another competitor.

01:16:22.371 --> 01:16:25.172
Goes to show the kind of men
they are, their true fabric.

01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:28.244
But they worked as a team together.

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:34.024
Oh, my God, look at that!
Are they okay?

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.258
It looks like they are.
I think I see--

01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:37.865
I see movement.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.724
l can't move my legs.
l can't move them.

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:04.243
Jimmy?

01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:05.750
Jimmy? You all right?

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:06.844
lt's just my foot.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.204
You'll be fine.
You'll come through this fine.

01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:11.470
-How's Memo?
-Fine, they're looking after him.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:28.537
Our thoughts, of course, with Memo
Moreno and his family at this point.

01:17:39.089 --> 01:17:40.256
Hey, Memo.

01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:41.803
Hey, Joe.

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:44.769
How do l look?

01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:46.976
Never looked better.

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.076
-Jimmy?
-Yeah?

01:17:53.129 --> 01:17:53.896
Hey.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.362
Thanks.

01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:59.169
-Memo, l'm sorry.
-You came back for me.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:01.409
Saved my life.

01:18:02.408 --> 01:18:03.275
We race.

01:18:04.169 --> 01:18:05.669
We take chances.

01:18:07.009 --> 01:18:07.976
l took this chance.

01:18:09.129 --> 01:18:10.296
So look at me.

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:13.309
Look at me.

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:14.855
Don't see you.

01:18:16.448 --> 01:18:17.515
See me.

01:18:19.408 --> 01:18:20.975
One who made a mistake.

01:18:23.568 --> 01:18:24.502
That's all.

01:18:26.329 --> 01:18:27.462
lt wasn't a mistake.

01:18:56.367 --> 01:18:57.501
How are you doing?

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:00.201
l'm all right.

01:19:00.688 --> 01:19:02.321
All right if l come in?

01:19:03.528 --> 01:19:04.461
Yeah.

01:19:08.607 --> 01:19:09.708
You tried to get him out.

01:19:10.607 --> 01:19:11.374
So did you.

01:19:11.728 --> 01:19:12.561
You were there first.

01:19:13.728 --> 01:19:16.228
l mean, he almost got you killed
and you still tried.

01:19:17.407 --> 01:19:18.174
Anybody would've.

01:19:19.167 --> 01:19:20.134
Would they?

01:19:22.807 --> 01:19:24.074
You're a good man, Jimmy.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.761
l'm sorry, l didn't want to win
the championship this way.

01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:30.214
See you.

01:20:04.686 --> 01:20:08.087
The old Joe Tanto had a couple
of attributes you should hold on to.

01:20:09.886 --> 01:20:11.320
Wasn't long ago you would've said:

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.373
''There but for the grace
of God, it's not me.''

01:20:15.965 --> 01:20:18.632
Quietly taking your place in the pack.

01:20:19.885 --> 01:20:20.719
Where is that guy?

01:20:21.886 --> 01:20:22.953
Where has he gone?

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:24.959
Who cares?

01:20:25.685 --> 01:20:26.585
l do.

01:20:27.046 --> 01:20:27.912
l miss him.

01:20:33.806 --> 01:20:36.272
You're the first to know
l'm terminating the kid's contract.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.999
-Why?
-l don't think he's the real deal.

01:20:41.485 --> 01:20:43.552
l don't think he's mentally
tough enough.

01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:46.812
l don't think he's adult enough!

01:20:47.366 --> 01:20:48.699
Gets out of a car in a race.

01:20:49.205 --> 01:20:51.239
-Saved a man's life.
-l'm not here to debate!

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:55.759
l'm gonna go for Brandenburg.
Next year.

01:20:56.925 --> 01:20:58.959
-What are you doing?
-Whatever it takes to win.

01:21:00.365 --> 01:21:02.199
-His brother know?
-He's brokering the deal.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:03.792
-Don't do this.
-lt's done!

01:21:04.245 --> 01:21:05.512
-Then undo it.
-You suddenly care.

01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:07.912
-Don't kill him off!
-Don't kill him off?

01:21:08.685 --> 01:21:10.119
l watched you kill yourself!

01:21:11.324 --> 01:21:14.191
You had everything,
and you threw it all away!

01:21:15.045 --> 01:21:17.345
And l had to sit there and watch!

01:21:18.684 --> 01:21:21.118
The slowest man in the fastest sport.

01:21:21.764 --> 01:21:25.665
l wake up every morning,
my legs are on fire.

01:21:26.884 --> 01:21:30.051
l know l'm gonna have to sit
in this chair for the rest of the day.

01:21:31.484 --> 01:21:34.551
But if they gave me one more chance,
l'd do it all over again.

01:21:37.725 --> 01:21:38.625
lt ain't gonna happen.

01:21:40.364 --> 01:21:44.031
We are all damaged.

01:21:48.684 --> 01:21:50.251
l've got an excuse.

01:21:51.483 --> 01:21:52.483
You don't.

01:21:54.044 --> 01:21:55.144
Do you?

01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:29.371
l want you to know that l know
about you going out to Brandenburg.

01:22:35.723 --> 01:22:36.856
Where have you been?

01:22:37.323 --> 01:22:38.457
Meeting after meeting.

01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:40.330
l've got a dinner right now.

01:22:40.802 --> 01:22:41.869
Catch you later?

01:22:42.682 --> 01:22:44.382
-Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

01:22:49.362 --> 01:22:50.129
Hello.

01:22:51.002 --> 01:22:52.669
Jimmy, it's Sophia.

01:22:53.443 --> 01:22:54.343
ls everything okay?

01:22:56.322 --> 01:22:57.222
Something l have to tell you.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.329
What restaurant did you pick?

01:23:05.883 --> 01:23:08.883
Nina, you're in great hands.
You are going to love this place.

01:23:09.683 --> 01:23:10.883
-DeMille.
-Jimmy.

01:23:11.522 --> 01:23:13.589
What are you doing here?
l'll just be a minute.

01:23:16.402 --> 01:23:17.869
Please don't walk away from me.

01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:19.948
Did you sell me out?

01:23:20.402 --> 01:23:22.035
Are you working for Brandenburg now?

01:23:23.122 --> 01:23:24.355
We should take this inside.

01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:25.795
Why are you doing this to me?

01:23:26.242 --> 01:23:27.542
Wait a minute! Who sold out first?

01:23:28.081 --> 01:23:30.015
l would never sell out my own brother.

01:23:30.642 --> 01:23:33.042
When you stopped listening
to me that's what you did.

01:23:33.682 --> 01:23:35.015
l just tried something different.

01:23:35.522 --> 01:23:36.922
For the first time
l thought for myself.

01:23:37.482 --> 01:23:39.548
-Was that wrong?
-Shutting me out is different.

01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:43.135
And l was with you all the way
until you handed your mind over...

01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:46.095
...to that has-been.
Who got you here?

01:23:46.681 --> 01:23:49.848
Who got all the glory? You couldn't
book a plane ticket without me.

01:23:50.682 --> 01:23:52.915
You left me, and let me
tell you something:

01:23:53.522 --> 01:23:54.855
There's no worse feeling
getting someone...

01:23:55.401 --> 01:23:57.302
...to the top only
to have them drop you.

01:23:57.922 --> 01:23:59.088
You did that, you.

01:23:59.881 --> 01:24:01.415
Ten years, Jimmy!

01:24:01.962 --> 01:24:03.195
All a waste.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.287
lt was coming together.
Why not wait a bit longer?

01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:08.555
Because l'm not your goddamn waiter.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.181
l was your manager.

01:24:10.641 --> 01:24:13.208
And l deserve better than that.
l deserve much better!

01:24:14.001 --> 01:24:17.168
Now you're over, and l am not going
down in flames with you, brother.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.414
That's one trip you're taking alone.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.427
Welcome to the Grand Prix.
It's a sunny day.

01:24:57.319 --> 01:25:00.053
It's going to be a great race.
After an eventful season...

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.287
...this comes down
to championship time.

01:25:10.479 --> 01:25:12.046
Everything's set.
Let's get this thing signed.

01:25:12.599 --> 01:25:14.733
After the race it'll be a madhouse.
What do you say?

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.466
Let's hear what she says.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.093
What's her idea?

01:25:18.559 --> 01:25:20.626
Her idea? What do you mean her idea?

01:25:21.319 --> 01:25:22.453
How does it feel?

01:25:22.919 --> 01:25:24.719
What? How does what feel?

01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:27.466
To be used.

01:25:27.999 --> 01:25:29.666
What, l didn't treat you with manners?

01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:31.799
You're gonna blow this over that?

01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:35.520
What, do you want to hit me?
Would that make you feel better?

01:25:37.319 --> 01:25:39.153
-Hurt?
-A little.

01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:41.699
Didn't hurt.

01:25:43.719 --> 01:25:44.619
Call that a punch?

01:26:24.757 --> 01:26:25.558
Did you know?

01:26:26.118 --> 01:26:27.851
-Know what?
-Know about my brother?

01:26:28.437 --> 01:26:29.471
Yeah, l knew.

01:26:29.878 --> 01:26:31.111
You could've told me.

01:26:31.678 --> 01:26:33.145
l hoped you could work things out.

01:26:33.798 --> 01:26:34.764
He was right, you know.

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:36.991
Never booked a plane ticket.

01:26:37.677 --> 01:26:41.244
Remember l said by the season's end
you're gonna know what you're made of?

01:26:42.518 --> 01:26:43.751
lt's the end of the season.

01:26:44.998 --> 01:26:46.165
lt's up to you.

01:26:51.437 --> 01:26:52.670
Carl, you have to let me race.

01:26:53.157 --> 01:26:53.958
l can win.

01:26:54.397 --> 01:26:57.397
Any driver that can't get out of
the car in five seconds can't run.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.164
Trying to prove you're
better than l think?

01:27:01.598 --> 01:27:02.498
Yeah.

01:27:05.878 --> 01:27:06.611
Time him.

01:27:23.957 --> 01:27:25.123
Ready?

01:27:26.797 --> 01:27:27.697
Go!

01:27:33.237 --> 01:27:34.837
-Four seconds.
-Great.

01:27:36.437 --> 01:27:37.203
Not bad.

01:27:39.076 --> 01:27:40.609
Now the vertical test.

01:27:41.796 --> 01:27:43.296
Carl, don't push it.

01:27:43.836 --> 01:27:45.270
The vertical test.

01:27:45.756 --> 01:27:48.923
You jump up and down
on the bad foot 10 times...

01:27:49.717 --> 01:27:51.317
...to see if you can handle
the pressure.

01:27:52.516 --> 01:27:54.450
Again, my rules.

01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:57.035
Don't glare, Joe.

01:27:58.156 --> 01:27:59.322
Makes your eyes look small.

01:27:59.956 --> 01:28:01.456
lt's all about commitment, right?

01:28:02.396 --> 01:28:03.230
-Right.
-Right.

01:28:03.996 --> 01:28:05.696
All right, Jimmy. One.

01:28:07.556 --> 01:28:08.722
Two.

01:28:13.036 --> 01:28:13.936
Three.

01:28:19.355 --> 01:28:20.155
Four.

01:28:21.836 --> 01:28:22.703
Five. Come on.

01:28:23.075 --> 01:28:24.742
Six. Come on, Jimmy.
Seven. Come on.

01:28:25.355 --> 01:28:27.256
Eight. Nine. Ten.

01:28:27.876 --> 01:28:28.909
-Yeah!
-Good.

01:28:33.955 --> 01:28:35.988
Too bad you didn't try
that hard sooner.

01:28:44.915 --> 01:28:46.249
There are 100 laps...

01:28:46.715 --> 01:28:50.016
...200 miles between this race
and a champion.

01:29:12.474 --> 01:29:13.474
Bye-bye, Daddy.

01:29:16.474 --> 01:29:17.607
Bye, Lucas.

01:29:46.994 --> 01:29:49.427
Going into this race,
Brandenburg was thinking...

01:29:50.153 --> 01:29:51.853
...he was the winner
of the championship.

01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:55.141
He was four points ahead,
and Bly looked out of the running.

01:29:55.873 --> 01:29:58.340
We've just received word
that Bly will be driving...

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:02.427
... which is amazing news after
his injury he suffered in Germany.

01:30:03.473 --> 01:30:07.074
So as it stands,
if Jimmy Bly wins this race...

01:30:07.993 --> 01:30:09.594
...he will become
the new world champion.

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.273
So why'd you do it?

01:30:15.113 --> 01:30:17.814
You helped me.
l thought maybe l could help you.

01:30:22.393 --> 01:30:23.993
-Well, l appreciate it.
-lt's okay.

01:30:24.512 --> 01:30:25.679
Don't go too fast.

01:30:29.433 --> 01:30:30.766
Take care. Appreciate you coming.

01:30:31.313 --> 01:30:32.879
Take care of yourself.

01:30:33.473 --> 01:30:37.307
Jimmy Bly is a hero today, along with
Joe Tanto and Beau Brandenburg...

01:30:38.353 --> 01:30:40.820
... who all got to the scene
of Memo Moreno's crash...

01:30:41.553 --> 01:30:44.153
... which had his car in the water.
He was about to drown.

01:30:44.912 --> 01:30:46.746
They jumped in,
got him out of the water...

01:30:47.353 --> 01:30:50.153
...before a big explosion
consumed the entire area.

01:30:52.432 --> 01:30:55.799
You know that if l lose this race,
l'm going to blame it on you.

01:30:57.071 --> 01:30:58.505
That's what l'm here for.

01:30:59.112 --> 01:31:00.145
l love you.

01:31:00.792 --> 01:31:01.659
l love you too.

01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:24.851
Gentlemen! Start your engines!

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:30.037
Let's look at the starting grid.

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:32.217
Beau Brandenburg
in the pole position.

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.190
Gidley will be following him.

01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:37.257
Joe Tanto in the Nextel car
starts 10th.

01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:41.330
Bly is starting
in the 26th pole position.

01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:42.843
He didn't qualify today.

01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:45.643
He's got 100 laps to catch
Beau Brandenburg...

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.190
...if he wants to become
world champion.

01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:15.962
We're off to a good start
here in Detroit.

01:33:18.349 --> 01:33:20.082
Brandenburg's jumped out in front.

01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:22.096
Trouble!

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:34.649
Tanto's caught in traffic.
He doesn't have anyplace to go!

01:33:38.388 --> 01:33:40.588
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are under a yellow flag...

01:33:41.309 --> 01:33:42.576
...until the cars can be removed.

01:33:43.028 --> 01:33:45.495
Joe Tanto is in the pit
with a broken front wing.

01:33:46.188 --> 01:33:47.521
What's the story on Tanto?

01:33:48.028 --> 01:33:49.662
Tanto is out of it.
Don't worry about him.

01:33:50.588 --> 01:33:51.688
Got it. That's too bad.

01:33:52.428 --> 01:33:53.329
Come on. Come on!

01:33:53.749 --> 01:33:56.749
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have just one lap until green.

01:34:00.308 --> 01:34:01.241
Go, go, go!

01:34:06.588 --> 01:34:09.655
A fast pit stop for the Nextel team,
but this unfortunate mishap...

01:34:10.468 --> 01:34:12.235
...is going to drop Tanto
to last place...

01:34:12.828 --> 01:34:15.128
...right behind his teammate,
Jimmy Bly.

01:34:17.347 --> 01:34:18.514
So, Jimmy, what do you think?

01:34:19.627 --> 01:34:20.727
lt's not looking too good.

01:34:21.747 --> 01:34:22.514
We can work through this.

01:34:23.228 --> 01:34:23.994
You think so?

01:34:24.507 --> 01:34:26.341
l know we can
if we stay tight and close.

01:34:27.148 --> 01:34:28.248
Okay. Let's do it.

01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:30.561
Green flag comes out again.

01:34:36.467 --> 01:34:37.801
l'll take it right, you cut left.

01:34:38.587 --> 01:34:40.987
Look at this amazing teamwork
between Bly and Tanto!

01:34:42.348 --> 01:34:44.314
Hey, Joe, not bad for an old-timer.

01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:46.514
That's it. Every man for himself.

01:34:50.707 --> 01:34:51.507
Hey, not so fast.

01:34:53.867 --> 01:34:55.500
Who wants to be in front
of the other?

01:34:56.027 --> 01:34:57.194
What the hell are you two doing?

01:34:58.067 --> 01:34:59.200
Back off, back off.

01:34:59.666 --> 01:35:00.866
Don't be afraid of me.

01:35:01.387 --> 01:35:02.887
Why would l be afraid of you?

01:35:03.466 --> 01:35:05.200
Carl, let Joe race his race.

01:35:05.787 --> 01:35:06.887
Thanks, kid. l appreciate that.

01:35:09.386 --> 01:35:11.653
Let's split them at the turn.
l'll take the inside.

01:35:12.466 --> 01:35:13.800
They split around another car!

01:35:14.347 --> 01:35:16.347
As they battle,
it brings both cars forward.

01:35:20.507 --> 01:35:21.674
Pass me on the left, Jimmy.

01:35:25.026 --> 01:35:25.959
Way to go.

01:35:26.626 --> 01:35:29.193
Tanto and Bly are double-teaming
the entire field.

01:35:29.867 --> 01:35:31.433
What an incredible display of driving!

01:35:35.826 --> 01:35:38.693
-Come on, don't stop now.
-Stopping? Who's stopping?

01:35:41.346 --> 01:35:43.346
We are now halfway
to the checkered flag.

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:45.572
Okay, Joe. Try to keep up.

01:35:51.906 --> 01:35:52.939
Still back there, Joe?

01:35:53.426 --> 01:35:54.793
-l'm still here.
-l'm impressed.

01:36:00.145 --> 01:36:02.446
Bly passes and Tanto
is following suit.

01:36:05.746 --> 01:36:09.079
With just 20 laps to go, Jimmy Bly
has just moved into seventh place...

01:36:09.985 --> 01:36:11.952
...and teammate
Joe Tanto is in sixth.

01:36:12.585 --> 01:36:13.385
Everybody's off the pace.

01:36:13.785 --> 01:36:15.419
But Bly and Tanto
are coming on strong.

01:36:15.945 --> 01:36:16.812
Brandenburg still leads.

01:36:17.225 --> 01:36:19.925
In second place is Alex Barron.
Barron has an engine go!

01:36:21.385 --> 01:36:23.285
Two cars swerving to miss the oil!

01:36:23.904 --> 01:36:27.105
Car up over the wall!
Several cars involved!

01:36:30.784 --> 01:36:33.718
Here comes Jimmy Bly.
He closes on the accident.

01:36:40.424 --> 01:36:41.958
Bly has nowhere to go.

01:36:49.784 --> 01:36:52.751
Bly and Tanto find
themselves in second and third...

01:36:53.584 --> 01:36:54.651
...behind Beau Brandenburg.

01:36:55.584 --> 01:36:58.484
The drivers will take advantage
of this full-course caution...

01:36:59.345 --> 01:37:02.312
...and enter the pits
for the last time this season.

01:37:05.224 --> 01:37:08.891
Brandenburg, Bly and Tanto all are
completing very fast pit stops.

01:37:11.144 --> 01:37:14.744
Now, with 10 laps to go,
Beau Brandenburg is in first place...

01:37:15.703 --> 01:37:18.937
...Jimmy Bly is in second,
and Joe Tanto is in third place.

01:37:21.623 --> 01:37:25.124
The world championship comes down
to these last 10 laps.

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.177
Jimmy, show them
what you're made of, kid.

01:37:31.943 --> 01:37:32.910
Okay, Joe.

01:37:33.704 --> 01:37:34.571
Green flag!

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:36.717
We're back to racing!

01:37:37.144 --> 01:37:39.044
It's a sprint to the finish
and championship.

01:37:44.103 --> 01:37:46.970
Bly is right on Brandenburg's tail.
He wants that championship.

01:37:47.783 --> 01:37:49.484
Take him now. Make your move.

01:37:51.223 --> 01:37:53.990
He comes alongside Brandenburg.
Brandenburg cuts him off!

01:37:57.863 --> 01:37:58.897
Bly is gonna try it again.

01:37:59.383 --> 01:38:01.250
He cuts and ducks inside!
Bly has the lead!

01:38:01.863 --> 01:38:04.763
Jimmy Bly has just taken the lead.

01:38:06.782 --> 01:38:08.916
Bly gets past Brandenburg.
He's in the lead.

01:38:09.543 --> 01:38:11.376
Great driving by Bly.

01:38:13.782 --> 01:38:15.682
Brandenburg won't let Bly
get away that easily.

01:38:16.343 --> 01:38:17.810
l'll pull him back in. There's time.

01:38:19.423 --> 01:38:21.323
Brandenburg is putting
pressure on Bly.

01:38:21.943 --> 01:38:22.810
Don't overreach, kid.

01:38:23.223 --> 01:38:25.590
Just four laps to go and you are
the world champion.

01:38:27.422 --> 01:38:28.589
He's losing it.

01:38:29.983 --> 01:38:30.683
Come on, Jimmy!

01:38:31.022 --> 01:38:34.023
Bly may be in trouble.
He weaves back and forth.

01:38:34.822 --> 01:38:37.289
Brandenburg is right there,
ready to get past him.

01:38:44.622 --> 01:38:46.655
And Brandenburg goes to the lead!

01:38:54.462 --> 01:38:55.395
Nice while it lasted.

01:38:57.061 --> 01:38:59.195
Bly loses the lead
with three laps to go.

01:38:59.781 --> 01:39:00.681
He tried.

01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:04.628
This is something we've seen
this young rookie do so many times.

01:39:05.542 --> 01:39:07.842
Carl Henry has got
to be disappointed.

01:39:13.582 --> 01:39:15.648
-What is he doing?
-Jesus.

01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:17.541
He's back.

01:39:21.341 --> 01:39:24.408
Now, Joe Tanto making a move.
He comes up alongside Jimmy Bly.

01:39:25.301 --> 01:39:27.468
He passes him! Tanto to second.

01:39:28.621 --> 01:39:30.188
They're shoving and elbowing
each other.

01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:33.235
Brandenburg, Tanto, Bly.
One, two, three.

01:39:39.861 --> 01:39:41.394
We've got one lap to go.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.840
Let's do it.

01:39:54.701 --> 01:39:57.434
Joe Tanto has taken the lead!

01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:59.287
Unbelievable.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:02.120
lt's incredible. l can't believe it.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.487
But problems with Tanto's car!

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.393
Tanto's in trouble.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.107
Will it hold together?

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:10.927
No, not for long.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.480
-Hang on, Joe.
-Stay in there.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.607
What's he doing? He ought
to park it but he stays in front!

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.520
l can't hold it together!
Take it, Jimmy!

01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:23.107
They split him!

01:40:23.779 --> 01:40:24.613
He's lifting off!

01:40:24.979 --> 01:40:26.513
l see that. He had it!

01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:30.827
Tanto has removed himself from
the race, leaving Brandenburg and Bly.

01:40:31.979 --> 01:40:35.280
Neck and neck down the homestretch,
battling for the world championship.

01:40:52.939 --> 01:40:56.072
Jimmy, just drive because you
love it. Drive for pure victory.

01:41:03.059 --> 01:41:04.292
He's humming.

01:41:08.098 --> 01:41:09.065
Thanks for going, Jimmy.

01:41:09.619 --> 01:41:11.386
Pure victory. You're right there.

01:41:13.778 --> 01:41:16.945
Suddenly, Jimmy Bly seems
to have a renewed vigor.

01:41:24.218 --> 01:41:25.385
You'll buckle! Back it down!

01:41:25.859 --> 01:41:27.992
Tanto's suspension has broken.
He's now spinning.

01:41:28.618 --> 01:41:30.418
But the battle is up front
for the flag!

Following Brandenburg, spinning
across the finish for third place.

01:41:59.938 --> 01:42:03.538
I'll say, the Hummer has taught
us something here today in Detroit.

01:42:04.497 --> 01:42:05.664
They're gonna kill me.

01:42:24.337 --> 01:42:25.371

01:42:55.216 --> 01:42:57.583
This year's champion, Jimmy Bly!

01:43:17.776 --> 01:43:19.576
Luc! Glad you stuck around.

01:43:21.496 --> 01:43:23.063

01:43:23.616 --> 01:43:25.116
Beau Brandenburg!

01:43:39.335 --> 01:43:41.302
Go on, you're missing
your celebration.

01:43:42.376 --> 01:43:43.809
Don't you go anywhere.

01:43:59.415 --> 01:44:00.349
...Joe Tanto!

01:44:05.895 --> 01:44:07.595
Jimmy! Jimmy, you did it, man.

01:44:11.375 --> 01:44:12.042
Thanks for everything.

01:44:12.455 --> 01:44:15.622
