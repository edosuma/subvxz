WEBVTT

00:08.350 --> 00:09.650
Candy.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.120
Mom!

00:12.220 --> 00:14.560
I find out that Ashy Slashy
is my real father,

00:14.660 --> 00:17.090
and he's got me sleeping
in his sister's old room.

00:17.190 --> 00:18.030
Hey, kiddo.

00:18.130 --> 00:19.060
Rise and shine.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.100
Some counselor
from Kenwood High

00:21.200 --> 00:22.260
left you one of
those text things.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.830
I've got you now.

00:23.930 --> 00:26.330
One thing is clear,
evil is after my offspring.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.940
The born and the unborn.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.710
From now on, protecting
Brandy is job one.

00:32.810 --> 00:34.210
You are in grave danger.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.640
Who sent you?

00:35.740 --> 00:37.050
Your uncle.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.050
The Brujo.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.980
There was a naked
lady right there.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.650
Those marks on your arms,
that's Sumerian writing.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.390
If I'm right,
this goes one of two ways.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.020
He kills us,
or we kill him.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:03.840 --> 01:06.170
Hey, kiddo.

01:06.270 --> 01:08.840
I'm sorry I'm late, I would've
gotten here sooner but, uh,

01:08.940 --> 01:10.410
I stopped to get
you some flowers.

01:10.510 --> 01:11.880
Oh. Oh, they're
dripping wet.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.680
Yeah. Well, that's how you
know they're fresh.

01:15.780 --> 01:18.150
Look, um...

01:18.250 --> 01:21.560
it's really nice
that you're here,

01:21.660 --> 01:23.590
but you barely
knew my mom.

01:23.690 --> 01:26.500
So you don't have to do this
whole "dad" thing,

01:26.600 --> 01:28.030
if you don't want.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.730
I mean I know you're trying,
but my guidance counselor

01:31.830 --> 01:33.870
offered to put me up
until I graduate.

01:33.970 --> 01:36.670
And I think maybe I should
take her up on it.

01:36.770 --> 01:38.210
Come on now,
I mean you know,

01:38.310 --> 01:40.710
50 bucks a week
was just a suggestion.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.180
You know?
Hm.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.480
I mean...

01:43.580 --> 01:45.650
I'll keep
the-the seat down.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.920
Yeah, I guess if-if my mom,
and the town

01:53.020 --> 01:56.890
can give you a second chance,
then I can too.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.860
You must be the husband
of the deceased?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
Yeah, for like an hour
and a half.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.530
Uh but,
lovingly.

02:04.630 --> 02:06.800
Relatives may pay their
respects to the deceased

02:06.900 --> 02:10.039
in the private viewing area,
if you wish.

02:10.139 --> 02:11.470
Oh, buddy boy.

02:11.570 --> 02:14.010
Um, are you sure
that's a good idea?

02:14.110 --> 02:14.880
Excuse me?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.680
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

02:16.780 --> 02:18.180
the kid's mom is, uh...

02:18.280 --> 02:19.680
minus a noggin.

02:19.780 --> 02:22.950
Oh, I think you'll find
she's been well restored.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.250
Restored?

02:25.350 --> 02:26.790
We reinstated
the head.

02:26.890 --> 02:28.390
Son of a bitch.

02:28.490 --> 02:29.990
I mean, thank you
very much.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.950
Sorry, baby,
it's nothing personal,

02:54.050 --> 02:55.850
but you know, if you've been
killed by a Deadite,

02:55.950 --> 02:58.050
a- a guy can't
be too careful.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.520
Well, uh...

03:02.620 --> 03:03.830
rest in peace,
Candy Barr.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.560
You were cursed
with a dumb name,

03:05.660 --> 03:08.830
but uh, I'll always
remember you.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.130
Or at least I'll never
forget you again.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.040
And of all the chicks,
you gave the...

03:50.470 --> 03:53.240
Hm. Ah! Hey!

04:05.590 --> 04:06.920
Hey!

04:14.560 --> 04:16.800
Damn, you look good, lover!
Oh!

04:16.899 --> 04:19.500
Oh! Oh!
Hands off the Johnson!

04:19.600 --> 04:21.500
Just like old times, eh?

04:21.600 --> 04:23.610
Oh, no. This ain't
the Kroger parking lot.

04:25.270 --> 04:26.780
Yeah!
Yee-hah!

04:26.880 --> 04:28.910
Oh, do you want
to take it slow?

04:29.010 --> 04:29.810
No, no, no!

04:29.910 --> 04:31.510
I don't want
to take it at all.

04:31.610 --> 04:33.680
Uh, where are you going?

04:33.780 --> 04:36.350
You know you want it, big boy!

04:36.450 --> 04:37.720
Yeah?
No, no, no, no, no.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.990
Yeah!

04:40.090 --> 04:40.890
Oh!

04:40.990 --> 04:43.490
Oh, that's more
like it, Ashy!

04:43.590 --> 04:46.830
Yeah!
No... means... no!

04:46.930 --> 04:48.860
Don't you want to kiss me?

04:51.530 --> 04:53.900
Is this better?

05:42.350 --> 05:44.950
How was that for you?

06:07.540 --> 06:09.480
We really should
get started.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.380
I'm sorry,
I don't know where he is.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.850
Can we just wait
five more minutes?

06:13.950 --> 06:16.420
I'm sorry, I think
we should start.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.260
Brandy, honey?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.860
Is there anything
I can do?

06:22.960 --> 06:26.430
No. It's just...
my stupid father.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.330
Thank you
for being here.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.630
Always.

06:30.730 --> 06:32.700
I'm here for you.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.620
Thank you for coming today,
to remember my mother Candace.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.130
She was a good
friend to so many...

06:59.230 --> 07:01.500
but most of all, she was my mom.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.930
When I think back...

07:13.440 --> 07:15.780
Um, when
I think back,

07:15.880 --> 07:17.910
I picture my mom trying
to raise her little girl

07:18.010 --> 07:20.720
in a world that sometimes
felt complicated and...

07:20.820 --> 07:22.950
Oh my God!

07:25.450 --> 07:26.790
God!

07:27.390 --> 07:29.930
Argh!

07:30.030 --> 07:32.160
Fucking hell!

07:35.430 --> 07:38.130
Oh. Jesus...

07:43.070 --> 07:46.910
Sorry folks. Just a...
little misunderstanding.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.950
Ew! Jesus Christ.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.820
We all grieve
in our own way.

08:16.340 --> 08:18.410
Go ahead, hon,
you're doing great.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.120
Um...

08:34.490 --> 08:36.020
she taught me...

08:39.929 --> 08:41.400
It's all right.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.860
I've got it.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.770
Well, uh, on behalf
of Brandy,

08:44.870 --> 08:47.970
I'd like to, uh, thank you
all for coming.

08:52.370 --> 08:55.640
Mr. Williams. I'd like to
express my sincere condolences.

08:55.740 --> 08:59.850
Oh, well, thanks, but you know,
I didn't really know her...

08:59.950 --> 09:01.980
Ruby.
Excuse me?

09:02.080 --> 09:04.550
Well, if it ain't
the she-devil herself.

09:04.650 --> 09:05.790
In church no less.

09:05.890 --> 09:06.960
You found the Book,
didn't you?

09:07.060 --> 09:08.320
What are you doing?

09:08.420 --> 09:10.490
This is my guidance
counselor, Ms. Prevett.

09:10.590 --> 09:11.860
The one you're
moving in with?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.130
That's right,
and I want to assure you,

09:13.230 --> 09:15.430
I only have your daughter's
best interests at heart.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.900
I don't know how she's doing it,
I don't know why she's doing it,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.630
but you got
to believe me kiddo.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.800
Little Miss Moffatt here,
is a black hearted hell beast!

09:22.900 --> 09:25.310
I have known her
for two whole years.

09:25.410 --> 09:28.610
Seriously?
I can almost explain.

09:28.710 --> 09:31.610
Who was your punk friend?

09:31.710 --> 09:33.110
Rachel.
Rachel. Right.

09:33.210 --> 09:37.320
Well, Ruby made her,
and your mom into demons.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.520
Ms. Prevett...

09:39.620 --> 09:44.630
turned my mom,
and my best friend into demons?

09:46.890 --> 09:48.460
I can't do this.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.870
I'm getting my stuff out
of your creepy house,

09:52.970 --> 09:54.200
and I never want
to see you again.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.100
Oh, Brandy.

09:58.070 --> 10:01.940
I think it's time
that you backed off, Ash.

10:02.040 --> 10:02.940
Of course there's nothing
you can do to me,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.550
but I'd hate
for anything to happen

10:04.650 --> 10:06.550
to your precious
little girl.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.720
You be careful,
Ruby.

10:08.820 --> 10:11.150
Never get between a Papa Bear,
and his cub.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.420
Ugh!

10:27.140 --> 10:29.940
Fuck me.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.070
Looks like a snuff
film in here.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.740
Well, Kelly. Pablo.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
New guy.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.910
You missed all
the excitement.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.120
Everybody's favorite skanky
demon Ruby is back,

10:40.220 --> 10:41.850
and she's yanking
Brandy's chain.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.280
Hold on, Ruby's back?
Yep.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.720
And this is the evil
immortal Ruby.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.390
Mm-hm.
Who's Ruby?

10:47.490 --> 10:48.620
Oh, boy.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.560
Oh shit.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.060
I'll be right back, guys.

11:04.110 --> 11:05.670
Naked lady?

11:09.440 --> 11:11.150
I think there's
a dress code.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.650
You must listen to the Brujo...

11:13.750 --> 11:17.520
you are in danger
from the demon woman.

11:17.620 --> 11:21.420
To protect you, he wants
to give you something...

11:23.760 --> 11:25.860
The Kandarian dagger?

11:27.060 --> 11:30.930
It is close to where
it was lost...

11:31.030 --> 11:32.830
you must go there.

11:32.930 --> 11:36.400
It is the key
to your salvation.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.770
Got it.

11:39.510 --> 11:44.180
Hey, uh, by the way,
you got a name?

11:44.280 --> 11:48.120
Maybe we could, uh,
grab a coffee sometime,

11:48.220 --> 11:51.520
or meet up, you know,
like at a clothing store...

11:51.620 --> 11:53.350
Find it!

11:53.450 --> 11:56.420
You must accept
your destiny.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.660
Cool.

11:58.930 --> 12:02.130
This demon, Ruby?
She's the Dark One?

12:02.230 --> 12:03.730
We need to kill her.
Now!

12:03.830 --> 12:06.400
You want to do that,
you need a Kandarian dagger.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.600
Guys.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.870
I think
it's still there.

12:09.970 --> 12:11.470
The dagger.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.910
I think it's at the place,
where the cabin went down.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.280
How would you know?

12:16.380 --> 12:17.910
Because a naked
lady told me.

12:18.010 --> 12:19.450
Uh...

12:19.550 --> 12:20.980
There's only one way
to find out.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.320
Road trip.

12:22.420 --> 12:23.820
Copy that.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.890
But you three are going to have
to go solo this time.

12:25.990 --> 12:26.890
What? What are you
going to do?

12:26.990 --> 12:28.360
I'm going to try
and talk some sense

12:28.460 --> 12:30.830
into my seriously
hormonal daughter.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.130
Good luck with that.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.190
So, where
do we start?

13:04.890 --> 13:06.760
Over there.

13:06.860 --> 13:07.730
Like,
way over there.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.450
Hard to believe
this is the place

13:30.550 --> 13:32.290
where evil
was released.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.760
It's harder
to believe,

13:34.860 --> 13:37.890
that evil keeps bringing us
back to the cabin,

13:37.990 --> 13:39.760
and this time
it's not even here.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.360
It's creepy being back.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.600
This was the last
place I saw Ruby.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.440
Two Rubies, actually.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.770
Then we should
dig fast.

14:02.980 --> 14:05.250
Kel.
Yeah?

14:05.350 --> 14:06.820
I got something.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.810
That dagger is
definitely here.

14:32.910 --> 14:33.950
You want me
to come with?

14:34.050 --> 14:36.920
I'll be fine,

14:37.020 --> 14:37.650
I just need to pull
myself together,

14:37.750 --> 14:40.490
and then I'll get a ride
to your place.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.760
Maybe I should
say goodbye to Ash.

14:42.860 --> 14:43.960
I'll be waiting.

15:40.950 --> 15:44.750
Some people just don't treat
family with enough respect.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.680
And they say there's no such
thing as second chances.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.210
Ash?

20:00.740 --> 20:02.540
I don't even know what
to think anymore.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.740
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.450
Now, now.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.180
It's that
damn Ash...

20:07.280 --> 20:10.590
boy's got more loose screws
than a Nevada cathouse.

20:12.590 --> 20:15.720
What do you think
you're doing?

20:15.820 --> 20:17.890
Oh, uh,
enjoying my couch,

20:17.990 --> 20:21.100
now that I swept off all
your nasty chips and shit.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.660
How about we watch it again?

20:23.760 --> 20:24.800
That'll bring a smile.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.800
You know me
as Ash Williams,

20:28.900 --> 20:31.640
the hero who saved
Elk Grove from evil.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.070
I'm serious, buddy.

20:33.170 --> 20:35.180
Watch, this is the best part.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.610
Because at Ashy Slashy's,

20:36.710 --> 20:38.450
"service" is literally...

20:38.550 --> 20:39.680
Not.
Our middle name!

20:39.780 --> 20:42.580
What a piece of shit.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.650
You actually
put this on TV?

20:44.750 --> 20:46.820
What's wrong with...?
Forget that.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.760
What the hell are you
doing in my house, creep-o?

20:48.860 --> 20:50.660
Enjoying the company
of the granddaughter

20:50.760 --> 20:52.030
I never knew I had.

20:52.130 --> 20:54.030
Brandy, you know your
grandpa's dead, right?

20:54.130 --> 20:55.500
Am not.
Is too.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.770
Nope.
What is your problem? He's fine.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.500
Forget him. Kid's got demon
on the brain.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.300
Your grandpa was run over
by the Delta.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.640
Yeah, he told me about
the accident.

21:05.740 --> 21:07.170
It's amazing he survived.

21:07.270 --> 21:10.540
Survived? His head was squashed
like a fucking watermelon!

21:10.650 --> 21:12.350
Uh, it'll keep more than
that shitty rent-a-wreck

21:12.450 --> 21:14.250
to keep me down.

21:14.350 --> 21:15.780
Can you please stop,
okay?

21:15.880 --> 21:17.520
This is the first
time that I have felt

21:17.620 --> 21:19.750
even close to normal
since I met you.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.560
Yeah, quit being
such an asshole,

21:21.660 --> 21:22.920
and let us enjoy
our family time.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.290
Come here, sweetness.
Thread 'er up again.

21:26.390 --> 21:27.590
Hey, Dad?

21:27.700 --> 21:28.800
Can we have a chat?

21:28.900 --> 21:31.700
Oh, that boy is such
a buzzkill.

21:38.740 --> 21:41.640
Found everything
but the dagger.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.680
Still think
we're getting warm?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.020
Hold on!

22:06.700 --> 22:09.400
Hello, gorgeous.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.810
Guys,
I found it!

22:19.680 --> 22:20.950
Shit.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.750
Guys!

22:24.820 --> 22:27.350
I think we need to get out
of here right now.

22:29.490 --> 22:31.660
Run!

22:44.840 --> 22:46.110
Pablo!

22:47.810 --> 22:50.850
Dalton!
Can you guys hear me?!

22:50.950 --> 22:53.380
Fuck!

22:57.150 --> 22:58.450
Hello?!

23:03.520 --> 23:06.730
Pablo...
goddamn it.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.000
Shit.

23:11.100 --> 23:14.430
Dalton!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:14.530 --> 23:16.800
No.

23:16.900 --> 23:20.540
It was Pablo...

23:20.640 --> 23:22.640
Pablo did this.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.850
Pablo did this to you?
Kelly, get out of here.

23:25.950 --> 23:28.520
Uh, look at me.

23:28.620 --> 23:30.720
Look at what your
fucking friend did.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.620
He set us up.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.690
What are you
talking about?

23:34.790 --> 23:37.590
We should have killed him
when we had the chance.

23:40.290 --> 23:41.830
Give me the dagger.

23:41.930 --> 23:43.900
There's got to be another way.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.270
Kelly...
give me the dagger.

23:48.370 --> 23:52.910
I told you this would happen,
but you wouldn't listen to me.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.580
I'm sorry, Dalton.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.410
I'm sorry too.

23:59.950 --> 24:03.120
Now give me that fucking dagger!

24:13.890 --> 24:16.030
Nobody fucks with
the Ghost Beaters!

24:20.800 --> 24:22.070
Pablo!

24:32.250 --> 24:33.350
Pablo?

24:38.750 --> 24:40.820
Dalton.

24:53.030 --> 24:55.900
Well, let's see,
he's got some beer...

24:56.000 --> 24:57.670
Pop-Tarts, and...

24:57.770 --> 24:59.270
and a old corn dog.

24:59.370 --> 25:01.040
Goddamn, boy.

25:01.140 --> 25:04.180
Don't you ou keep any
real food around here?

25:04.280 --> 25:05.680
What's your game,
Gramps?

25:05.780 --> 25:07.450
Why's everything got
to be a drama with you?

25:07.550 --> 25:09.450
We got rope!

25:09.550 --> 25:11.550
We got rubber!
We got it all!

25:11.650 --> 25:12.720
That cutie-pie's
counselor

25:12.820 --> 25:15.060
asked me to drop
in on her, that's all.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.420
Oh, yeah?
Your buddy Ruby?

25:16.520 --> 25:18.060
Yeah, ol' Sasquatch.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.730
That fine looking
slice of evil

25:19.830 --> 25:21.530
pulled me right
from the dirt.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.470
Go ahead,
make your move.

25:25.570 --> 25:27.570
I put you in the dirt once,
I can do it again.

25:27.670 --> 25:31.740
Oh, attaboy. Show Brandy
the monster that you really are.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.970
To "ildo."
Goddamn it.

25:33.070 --> 25:36.640
Because at Ashy Slashy's
service is literally...

25:36.740 --> 25:38.780
Oh, what are you doing?
My middle...

25:38.880 --> 25:41.380
You think she hates you now?

25:41.480 --> 25:42.720
Whoa!

25:44.720 --> 25:45.820
Oh, boy.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.320
Don't worry about Brandy,

25:47.420 --> 25:48.820
I'll give her a shoulder
to cry on.

25:55.730 --> 25:58.430
I like my kids cooked
medium rare!

26:05.570 --> 26:09.080
And I love the smell
of old man in the morning!

26:24.220 --> 26:25.330
Ah! Hey!

26:33.730 --> 26:35.600
Ow.

27:16.580 --> 27:20.410
Uh... the good news
is I can explain.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.320
I wish you were
the one that was dead.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.850
Honey, don't judge a book
by its cover!

27:25.950 --> 27:28.560
Leave me alone.
No, look, sweetie,

27:28.660 --> 27:29.820
I didn't even
kill him,

27:29.920 --> 27:31.660
because he's already dead!

27:34.290 --> 27:35.400
Kids.
