WEBVTT

00:15.856 --> 00:17.041
I know, come on.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.352
Sit down.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.866
- Why are you hiding?
- 'Cause we weren't invited, Lucas.

00:36.926 --> 00:39.598
It's the after party.
It belongs to all of us.

00:40.251 --> 00:41.929
An invitation
would have been redundant.

00:41.989 --> 00:43.518
It would have been polite.

00:43.741 --> 00:45.866
Come on. They're all going
to be happy to see us.

00:45.926 --> 00:48.962
They're never happy to see us at lunch.
Why would it be so different now?

00:50.364 --> 00:51.364
Because.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.183
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:57.410 --> 00:58.482
Hey, guys.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.875
Look what we brought.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.766
They don't look so happy.

01:07.605 --> 01:10.096
Help. Help, help...

01:56.036 --> 01:58.110
- I'm not even going to ask.
- Allow me.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.434
- What are you doing, Tony?
- Best deep-in-thought face.

02:01.494 --> 02:03.298
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

02:05.771 --> 02:08.579
Nailed it.
All right, strawdawg24, beat this one.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.039
Yeah, baby.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.417
Ibeatyou.com.

02:12.556 --> 02:15.246
The place to compete online
with anyone in anything.

02:15.306 --> 02:17.880
Yeah, it's very fun.
It's very addictive. Look at this guy.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.048
Best air guitar.
Look at that guy.

02:20.130 --> 02:21.299
Best do the Hustle.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.465
I mean, you name it, they got it.

02:23.674 --> 02:26.097
- "The Hustle"?
- The Hustle. Saturday Night Fever?

02:26.308 --> 02:27.308
Travolta.

02:28.116 --> 02:29.116
You know.

02:30.496 --> 02:32.996
- What is the point?
- What is the point of any dance?

02:33.056 --> 02:35.456
It's about letting loose.
It's, you know, having a good time.

02:35.683 --> 02:37.358
I meant the Web site, Tony.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.809
It's fun.

02:39.023 --> 02:40.102
It is...

02:40.162 --> 02:41.946
amusement,
light-hearted pleasure.

02:42.798 --> 02:44.031
I know what you're doing.

02:44.112 --> 02:45.450
I know how to have fun.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.452
Really? Do tell.

02:47.622 --> 02:49.361
The hustling and
the deep-thinking photos,

02:49.421 --> 02:52.457
those are all just, you know,
child's play. Tell him, McGee.

02:56.532 --> 02:57.532
McGee?

02:59.001 --> 03:00.962
I'm working on
my best psycho face here.

03:01.203 --> 03:02.428
That's not bad, probie.

03:02.488 --> 03:04.719
Just need to work it
a little bit at the eyebrow.

03:05.049 --> 03:06.225
See what I'm saying?

03:06.452 --> 03:07.637
See how that reads?

03:07.719 --> 03:09.474
See that? That's what you want.

03:09.555 --> 03:11.675
Would you two like
some time alone together?

03:12.112 --> 03:13.332
No, boss. We were just...

03:13.392 --> 03:15.820
- Acting like children.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.982
Got a dead petty officer
in the woods, let's go.

03:18.674 --> 03:21.314
- Check out the air guitarists yet?
- I'm in third place right now.

03:23.735 --> 03:25.300
Petty Officer Greg Collins.

03:25.638 --> 03:26.490
Twenty-six.

03:26.571 --> 03:27.992
Worked as a boatswain's mate

03:28.072 --> 03:29.577
on the USS Shenandoah.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.059
On 30-day leave.

03:32.232 --> 03:33.584
Lives alone in Norfolk.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.172
Gibbs.

03:35.544 --> 03:37.729
Found a blood trail, goes this way.

03:38.358 --> 03:39.652
Leads back to the car.

03:39.859 --> 03:40.859
Run off the road.

03:41.233 --> 03:42.804
You know that just by looking?

03:43.992 --> 03:46.141
Listening, DiNozzo.
The sheriff told me.

03:50.252 --> 03:51.641
Gonna follow the blood trail.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.271
Wait for me, Pocahontas.

03:53.331 --> 03:56.771
Well, this fellow didn't come here
to roast marshmallows.

03:58.486 --> 03:59.838
Blunt force trauma.

04:00.669 --> 04:03.861
Glass fragment cuts
on the exposed skin.

04:04.046 --> 04:06.531
Seatbelt restraint contusions,
all consistent

04:06.612 --> 04:07.931
- with a...
- Car accident.

04:07.991 --> 04:09.325
Stumbles in looking for help.

04:09.484 --> 04:10.993
Yeah, well, he certainly needed it.

04:11.421 --> 04:13.791
However, what is strange is that

04:13.851 --> 04:17.017
these minor abrasions were tended to,

04:17.077 --> 04:20.378
whereas
his most serious injuries were not.

04:24.768 --> 04:25.860
This explains it.

04:25.963 --> 04:29.511
These wounds are older.
They show signs of primary hemostasis.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.059
First stages of scab formation.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.062
It appears our deceased
had an unfortunate accident

04:38.143 --> 04:40.789
before
he had his unfortunate accident.

04:52.281 --> 04:54.141
Someone didn't know
how to parallel park.

04:54.316 --> 04:56.996
I have always found it hard to park
when someone is shooting at you.

04:57.050 --> 04:58.916
Found the slug
in the passenger headrest.

04:59.914 --> 05:01.339
Missed its target, huh?

05:01.586 --> 05:02.587
Got the job done.

05:03.615 --> 05:04.615
Talk to me.

05:04.927 --> 05:07.341
Well, it looks like Collins' car
was shot at, boss.

05:07.427 --> 05:10.511
Several partial fingerprints
on the driver's side window here.

05:13.594 --> 05:14.733
Time of crash?

05:14.905 --> 05:17.659
Well, the kids didn't hear any gunshots
or the crash, so it must've been...

05:17.683 --> 05:18.894
Wasn't a question.

05:22.418 --> 05:24.835
The clock on the dash is broken.

05:25.980 --> 05:26.980
Right.

05:29.026 --> 05:30.520
7:22 P.M.

05:30.946 --> 05:33.019
- Hour before the party started.
- Shoe print.

05:33.079 --> 05:34.079
The victim's?

05:37.586 --> 05:38.747
That's not a Chuck.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.472
Collins was wearing "Chuck Taylor".

05:41.717 --> 05:43.377
"Converse All-Stars".

05:43.804 --> 05:46.296
You know, basketball shoes.
That's not a Chuck.

05:46.378 --> 05:47.718
Somebody else was here.

05:48.872 --> 05:49.872
Passenger?

05:50.115 --> 05:51.115
Yeah.

05:51.703 --> 05:52.721
Or shooter.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.294
This is getting like a Greek tragedy.

05:58.037 --> 06:01.942
Did you know that legend
has it that in 456 B.C.,

06:02.149 --> 06:05.104
a vulture mistook a man's bald head

06:05.164 --> 06:07.178
for its prey
and dropped a stone on it?

06:07.429 --> 06:08.913
Killed him instantly.

06:09.114 --> 06:11.668
Yeah, the unfortunate fellow
became known as...

06:11.728 --> 06:13.506
The father of Greek tragedy.

06:14.316 --> 06:17.286
I had no idea you were familiar
with the classics, Jethro.

06:18.744 --> 06:21.155
Perhaps it's only the tragedies?

06:22.304 --> 06:23.501
What do you got for me?

06:23.879 --> 06:25.498
Well, like Aeschylus,

06:25.558 --> 06:29.184
our petty officer's death
is both tragic and unique.

06:29.688 --> 06:31.746
He suffered two types of injury:

06:31.806 --> 06:33.678
Those sustained in the car crash

06:33.759 --> 06:37.181
and those inflicted
on him prior to it, see?

06:37.587 --> 06:40.184
This fist-shaped bruise
on his forehead,

06:40.264 --> 06:43.182
the gouges on his cheek
by the broken jaw.

06:43.242 --> 06:44.265
He was beaten.

06:44.804 --> 06:45.804
Savagely.

06:46.243 --> 06:48.377
And he fought back as well.

06:48.869 --> 06:51.612
See, the knuckles on his right hand
are skinned raw.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.533
However, Abby performed a DNA test

06:55.614 --> 06:58.650
on some skin fragments
I found under Collins' fingernails.

06:58.950 --> 07:01.163
Presumably,
they belong to his attacker.

07:01.559 --> 07:04.264
Our brilliant forensic scientist

07:04.668 --> 07:07.764
has now come up
with something most interesting.

07:08.626 --> 07:11.632
The same DNA on Collins' bandages.

07:12.053 --> 07:13.093
Same person.

07:13.153 --> 07:17.137
The hands that pummeled the petty
officer also bandaged his wounds.

07:17.748 --> 07:20.523
Whoever did this,
Jethro, is both savage

07:21.814 --> 07:23.171
and a Samaritan.

07:34.859 --> 07:37.539
Do you have the crime scene photos?
I need to cue them up for Gibbs.

07:37.592 --> 07:39.183
Tony was supposed to upload them.

07:39.394 --> 07:40.477
Where is he?

07:40.537 --> 07:41.647
Big Wong's.

07:41.816 --> 07:43.062
It's his turn for takeout.

08:02.679 --> 08:04.417
So this is air guitaring?

08:04.497 --> 08:05.497
Yeah.

08:05.648 --> 08:08.706
You know,
you pretend to play the guitar.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.798
Why not actually play the guitar?

08:10.993 --> 08:12.884
Because it is called air guitaring.

08:13.323 --> 08:15.028
Right. I got that part.

08:15.088 --> 08:16.528
I still do not understand...

08:16.588 --> 08:18.306
Ziva, photos. Plasma.

08:21.055 --> 08:24.145
There are two sets of tire tracks
on the road near the crash.

08:24.225 --> 08:26.314
Based on the vectoring
of the skids, both cars

08:26.395 --> 08:28.097
were traveling
in the same direction.

08:29.026 --> 08:30.849
Bullet through the back window.

08:30.909 --> 08:31.944
I smell road rage.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.321
And I smell Big Wong.

08:34.924 --> 08:37.450
Collins swerves,
rolls down the embankment.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.409
The other driver
goes down looking for him.

08:39.490 --> 08:41.410
Finds a corpse and bails,
hit-and-run.

08:41.491 --> 08:42.746
Shoot and run.

08:48.077 --> 08:49.504
My God, I'm so sorry. I just...

08:53.464 --> 08:56.677
Shooter could have known Collins.
Ran him off the road on purpose.

08:56.839 --> 08:58.959
Well, we'll know soon enough.

08:59.265 --> 09:02.593
Abby's running the prints from
the driver's side window through AFIS.

09:02.653 --> 09:06.144
Boss, I've been monitoring Collins' cell
phone activity. He just received a call.

09:06.225 --> 09:07.225
From who?

09:07.401 --> 09:08.695
Home security service.

09:08.901 --> 09:10.548
Collins' alarm is going off.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.861
I see you like going through
my photos, huh?

09:14.105 --> 09:15.340
Yeah, I like reading.

09:15.443 --> 09:17.621
Hemingway, Dostoevsky,
guess what he wrote?

09:18.112 --> 09:19.112
The Idiot.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.276
Clear.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.570
Clear inside.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.526
But we got something.

09:34.105 --> 09:35.482
Found it in a laundry basket.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.298
Maybe the laundromat
was out of quarters.

09:37.358 --> 09:38.885
Looks like six, $700 there.

09:39.275 --> 09:41.231
They forced the latch
on the back door open.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.347
Forgot the money.

09:42.482 --> 09:43.482
Gibbs.

09:43.971 --> 09:46.143
Blood's dry. At least a day old.

09:47.808 --> 09:49.814
Looks like
the Tooth Fairy missed one.

09:50.062 --> 09:51.649
A couple more here. Bag 'em.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.528
Damn. Neighbors.

09:56.606 --> 09:57.606
Come on.

10:01.045 --> 10:03.411
I'm Bruce Solomon.
I live across the street.

10:03.491 --> 10:05.997
I'm, Adam Parker,
the duplex with the English ivy.

10:06.313 --> 10:09.695
We... we heard the alarm.
It's been going off for 46 minutes.

10:10.636 --> 10:12.074
We did a quick patrol.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.005
No signs of any suspicious activity.

10:14.085 --> 10:15.673
Let me guess, Neighborhood Watch.

10:16.262 --> 10:17.262
Is Greg okay?

10:17.859 --> 10:19.427
Petty Officer Collins is dead.

10:19.857 --> 10:21.530
Car accident, last night.

10:21.842 --> 10:23.764
- Oh, my God.
- Was it on Route Ten?

10:23.844 --> 10:26.934
'Cause we've petitioned the city for
a turn lane there for a long time.

10:27.291 --> 10:29.687
Collins was murdered.
Run off the road.

10:34.172 --> 10:35.644
You don't look surprised.

10:35.704 --> 10:37.612
You have a lot of murders here
on Wisteria Lane?

10:37.881 --> 10:41.198
Well, it's a, it's a very quiet area,
but ever since Greg moved in...

10:41.278 --> 10:42.361
Not so quiet.

10:42.421 --> 10:44.313
There's music, parties...

10:44.750 --> 10:45.821
lots of drinking.

10:46.045 --> 10:46.871
Last week,

10:46.951 --> 10:49.382
it got completely out of hand.
There was this whole gang of them.

10:49.406 --> 10:52.179
And then a fight broke out,
but nobody tried to break it up.

10:52.239 --> 10:55.085
They were just standing around cheering.
It was weird. It reminded me of...

10:55.109 --> 10:56.109
Tyler Durden.

10:56.211 --> 10:57.757
Yeah, exactly.

10:58.003 --> 10:58.716
Who?

10:58.987 --> 11:00.635
Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, Fight Club.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.763
Sorry, Ziva,
we don't talk about fight club.

11:05.287 --> 11:07.366
In your case, I'll make an exception,
boss.

11:07.426 --> 11:09.367
Underground backyard brawls.

11:09.613 --> 11:11.938
No rules, no gloves, no mercy.

11:13.394 --> 11:16.215
There's a huge black market
for underground fight videos.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.610
It starts in the backyard...

11:17.812 --> 11:19.413
Ends on the back road.

11:20.091 --> 11:22.082
No match on the partials
from Collins' car.

11:22.142 --> 11:23.782
And this is the best of them.

11:23.864 --> 11:25.553
Partials are a little tougher.

11:25.613 --> 11:27.507
But that hasn't stopped me,
nor will it ever,

11:27.567 --> 11:30.241
because I am the Energizer Bunny
of forensic science.

11:30.301 --> 11:32.162
I never sleep and I never give up.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.588
Help, I'm losing power.

11:39.211 --> 11:40.211
Shoe print.

11:40.641 --> 11:42.343
We couldn't match it
to any known brand.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.116
Even Tony didn't recognize it.

11:44.176 --> 11:45.804
You know his shoe collection.

11:45.864 --> 11:47.490
We think the shoe was custom-made.

11:47.550 --> 11:48.766
And very pricey.

11:50.426 --> 11:51.426
Sweet.

11:51.701 --> 11:52.979
I heart the VODD.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.956
Virginia Offender DNA Databank.

11:57.302 --> 12:00.311
Abby ran the DNA from
Collins' bandages and hit the jackpot.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.488
Name?

12:04.199 --> 12:07.200
Patience, fearless leader,
I'm just uploading the data right now.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.705
And the winner is...

12:10.766 --> 12:11.766
Sam Bennett.

12:12.195 --> 12:15.375
Civilian. Rap sheet includes petty
theft, B and E, disorderly conduct.

12:15.457 --> 12:17.225
Doesn't appear to have
a permanent address.

12:17.285 --> 12:18.285
Work?

12:23.547 --> 12:24.844
Shiver me timbers,

12:25.327 --> 12:28.055
looks like Bennett was part of
a salvage crew on a ship.

12:28.229 --> 12:29.582
Navy frigate, boss.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.298
USS Rubicon.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.520
You know
how a ship is decommissioned?

12:35.643 --> 12:36.643
Yep.

12:36.703 --> 12:40.192
First the military removes all the,
uh, classified material,

12:40.454 --> 12:42.737
the electronics, weapons.

12:43.452 --> 12:44.452
Yes.

12:44.891 --> 12:45.891
I know.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.429
The hull of the ship
is striped for scrap.

12:51.743 --> 12:55.095
And if a ship has a history,
it may be turned into a maritime museum.

12:55.281 --> 12:56.750
You guys the Navy cops?

12:57.151 --> 12:58.925
Yeah, my seahorse
is double-parked outside.

12:58.985 --> 13:01.465
You ought to see the lights.
We're here to talk to Sam Bennett.

13:01.858 --> 13:03.549
- Not here.
- Come again?

13:04.830 --> 13:06.461
Bennett, he's not on the ship.

13:06.521 --> 13:08.495
Are you the foreman
that I spoke to earlier,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.270
said that Sam Bennett was here?

13:10.330 --> 13:11.976
Yeah, was.

13:12.930 --> 13:14.525
He clocked in earlier today.

13:19.370 --> 13:21.354
He's wanted in connection
with a murder.

13:21.414 --> 13:23.119
We're here to speak with him.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.945
Look, I can't find him, okay?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.802
I had my crew look everywhere.

13:26.915 --> 13:28.382
After I told him

13:28.612 --> 13:31.452
you were coming, he told the guys
he was going out for a smoke.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.039
- He never came back.
- Do you know where he's staying?

13:35.662 --> 13:37.836
I don't really ask a lot of questions.

13:38.353 --> 13:41.153
You know, these-these salvage guys,
they're not exactly...

13:41.213 --> 13:42.963
Employee of the Month material.
We got it.

13:43.543 --> 13:44.780
Here you go. Sorry.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.180
Bennett's on the run.

13:52.472 --> 13:53.538
I need a BOLO.

13:53.598 --> 13:56.530
Sam Bennett. Caucasian male, 23.

13:57.482 --> 13:58.538
Go, McGee.

13:59.101 --> 14:00.790
Well, Bennett doesn't have a cell.

14:00.850 --> 14:02.816
No e-mail. No driver's license.

14:02.897 --> 14:04.028
No living relatives.

14:04.088 --> 14:05.516
Not even a library card.

14:05.576 --> 14:06.736
No. Bennett.

14:06.817 --> 14:07.818
As in Tony.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.793
B-E-N-N-E-T-T.

14:10.079 --> 14:11.856
He's gotta exist somewhere.
Keep looking.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.289
With an "S".

14:13.349 --> 14:14.662
- Sam?
- Yeah.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.359
As in Sam I am. Sam.
"Play it again, Sam."

14:17.419 --> 14:18.994
- Sam with an "S".
- OK, got it.

14:19.054 --> 14:20.054
Oh, my gosh.

14:20.082 --> 14:22.966
He's 23, six foot three, 210 pounds,

14:23.026 --> 14:24.338
light brown hair, blue eyes,

14:24.419 --> 14:26.931
and a barbwire tattoo
on his left bicep.

14:27.477 --> 14:28.594
He was last seen...

14:28.793 --> 14:30.177
Standing right behind you.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.467
I love it
when they turn themselves in.

14:59.174 --> 15:00.694
You want to tell me about Greg?

15:07.068 --> 15:09.558
Stood by me
when everyone else bailed.

15:12.172 --> 15:16.140
Taught me how to look out for
something else besides just myself.

15:17.574 --> 15:18.633
Four-oh sailor.

15:21.006 --> 15:22.300
He was my best friend.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.144
I made a lot of mistakes.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.262
And he-he turned my life around.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.011
I owe him everything.

15:30.694 --> 15:33.098
He got me
the welding gig on the ship.

15:33.179 --> 15:34.845
I'm-I'm good with my hands.

15:35.713 --> 15:37.701
Greg's face said the same thing.

15:41.521 --> 15:42.774
Tell me about the fights.

15:46.258 --> 15:47.491
Not supposed to.

15:48.610 --> 15:49.610
Fight club.

15:49.652 --> 15:52.072
Told you.
You should look into it sometime.

15:52.132 --> 15:54.618
- I'm sure you'd enjoy yourself.
- I remember my first fight.

15:54.758 --> 15:55.758
I was eight.

15:55.929 --> 15:57.220
Shmuel Rubinstein.

15:58.137 --> 15:59.457
Sounds like a real stud.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.500
One punch and it was over.

16:02.011 --> 16:05.380
What did Shmuel Rubinstein
do to deserve the wrath of Ziva?

16:06.385 --> 16:07.561
He said he liked me.

16:07.731 --> 16:09.759
I keep my promises.
He was my buddy.

16:10.346 --> 16:11.516
Your buddy's dead.

16:17.180 --> 16:19.454
The locations move around a lot.

16:22.008 --> 16:24.837
Last week the fights
went down at Greg's place.

16:26.325 --> 16:27.880
He cleaned up,

16:28.383 --> 16:29.445
won some cash.

16:30.387 --> 16:31.739
And the fights yesterday?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.941
Vacant lot in Chesapeake.

16:36.888 --> 16:39.414
So you and, Collins,
you fought each other.

16:40.558 --> 16:42.917
We didn't want to,
but we didn't have a choice.

16:44.825 --> 16:46.757
The-the fights are random draw.

16:51.909 --> 16:54.929
When it was over,
I fixed him up as best I could.

16:58.574 --> 16:59.684
Then I killed him.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.141
Wait a minute,
that was way too easy.

17:04.201 --> 17:06.259
He didn't even get the Gibbs glare.

17:06.428 --> 17:09.151
- Could be covering for someone.
- With my own bare hands.

17:09.699 --> 17:13.323
When my foreman told me that you guys
were looking for me, I freaked out.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.366
But I'm done running.

17:16.329 --> 17:19.978
I owe it to Greg to do the right thing
and to turn myself in.

17:20.402 --> 17:21.660
You didn't kill him.

17:24.325 --> 17:26.044
He's dead because of me.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.045
You in the car with him?

17:30.103 --> 17:33.232
No, his-his eyes
were practically swollen

17:33.440 --> 17:35.053
shut from the fight.

17:35.551 --> 17:37.680
I told him that
it wasn't safe to drive.

17:38.745 --> 17:40.112
He wouldn't listen.

17:42.577 --> 17:45.730
I tried to stop him,
and he just got in his car and he left.

17:46.737 --> 17:48.691
Well, 20 minutes later,
somebody shot up his car.

17:50.642 --> 17:51.642
What?

17:52.142 --> 17:53.488
Crash wasn't an accident.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.531
Wait, somebody killed him?

17:56.206 --> 17:57.206
Sit down.

18:04.634 --> 18:05.667
Who shot at him?

18:06.765 --> 18:08.919
- Any fighters have a grudge?
- I don't know.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.628
I don't know any of them.

18:10.688 --> 18:13.768
Greg would just bring me in to make some
extra dough when I was tight on cash.

18:13.797 --> 18:14.797
Names?

18:16.384 --> 18:17.571
Reaper,

18:18.090 --> 18:20.056
- Wild Dog...
- No, their real names.

18:20.137 --> 18:21.724
I don't know their real names.

18:21.944 --> 18:24.544
But when I find out who did this
to Greg, they're gonna know mine.

18:24.597 --> 18:27.894
And that is the last thing
they're ever gonna know!

18:31.060 --> 18:34.445
Think one of those backyard brawlers
whacked Collins?

18:34.525 --> 18:36.852
Well, I doubt they're
the most stable kind of people.

18:36.912 --> 18:39.951
Big, hairy, sweaty Neanderthals
pounding the pudding out

18:40.031 --> 18:42.168
- of each other for giggles?
- For green.

18:42.768 --> 18:44.706
One of those fighters
make a lot of money.

18:44.979 --> 18:46.373
I'd pay to see the right bout.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.168
Like Leroy Jethro Gibbs

18:49.634 --> 18:51.462
- versus...
- Ziva.

18:51.866 --> 18:53.631
McGee,
I was thinking like Terminator.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.050
Which model? T-X? T-1000?

18:56.205 --> 18:57.205
All of them.

18:57.392 --> 18:58.771
Gibbs terminates.

18:58.831 --> 19:02.056
All right,
how about Gibbs versus Godzilla.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.462
King of the Monsters...

19:03.895 --> 19:04.895
toast.

19:05.205 --> 19:05.976
Mothra.

19:06.058 --> 19:07.895
Wingless in a nanosecond.

19:08.644 --> 19:11.107
Come on,
McGee, give me something fierce.

19:11.339 --> 19:12.834
Boss man's got mad skills.

19:12.894 --> 19:13.894
All right.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.989
Okay. Gibbs versus...

19:20.483 --> 19:21.483
Gibbs.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.541
That's good.

19:23.645 --> 19:26.532
Okay, so, evil twin or a clone?

19:30.020 --> 19:31.836
Good timing.
I have something to show you.

19:32.918 --> 19:36.204
We found three layers of paint
on the left rear quarter panel,

19:36.788 --> 19:38.232
silver and then brown,

19:38.292 --> 19:40.678
and then silver again
over the original gold.

19:41.021 --> 19:43.166
This is old-fashioned bumper cars.

19:44.238 --> 19:46.017
By using the tire skids on the road,

19:46.097 --> 19:48.010
we were able to recreate
the accident.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.961
The first layer of paint is silver.

19:50.021 --> 19:51.848
It came from the evil mystery car.

19:53.139 --> 19:54.650
It rams Collins' car.

19:54.858 --> 19:55.860
He swerves.

19:55.940 --> 19:59.424
Pumps the brakes, and
he leaves this tire skid on the road.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.494
Then Collins' was shot at.

20:04.723 --> 20:06.509
The bullet hole in the back window?

20:06.569 --> 20:08.463
And there's
two more slugs in the car.

20:08.523 --> 20:10.090
So, Collins hits the gas,

20:10.150 --> 20:12.794
he burns rubber,
and then fishtails into a barricade.

20:14.274 --> 20:15.393
A brown barricade!

20:15.859 --> 20:17.215
The second layer of paint.

20:17.337 --> 20:18.572
Then another, bam!

20:18.725 --> 20:21.109
As the evil car hits Collins' car
one last time,

20:21.169 --> 20:24.119
sends him off the road
and giving us the final layer

20:24.179 --> 20:26.931
of silver paint,
and confirming its evilosity.

20:27.148 --> 20:30.018
The silver base coat,
it contains three properties:

20:30.100 --> 20:33.731
Methyl ethyl ketone,
xylene and titanium dioxide.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.528
Now,
the first two are common solvents.

20:36.588 --> 20:38.784
Titanium dioxide, not so much.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.571
So, we should be able to trace it.

20:40.651 --> 20:42.198
- Then do it.
- Hey, boss.

20:42.756 --> 20:43.784
Yes, McGee?

20:48.957 --> 20:50.352
Have you ever lost a fight?

20:53.459 --> 20:55.210
Not sure I even ever won one.

20:56.490 --> 20:58.115
Definitely a Gibbs clone.

20:59.706 --> 21:02.648
I'm cross-referencing the paint
against a database of automakers.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.774
Got a match here,
Maserati Quattroporte, 2009.

21:05.834 --> 21:07.764
Need some serious coin
to roll in one of those.

21:07.824 --> 21:09.349
- Find it.
- Several registered

21:09.409 --> 21:13.024
in the tri-state area.
Two belong to Muhammad Al-Qazir.

21:13.084 --> 21:15.606
Unfortunately,
these are both Baltic Black Metallic.

21:16.086 --> 21:17.942
Argenta Silver. Oh.

21:18.604 --> 21:19.360
Got it.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.611
Tabitha Summers.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.253
Looks rich.

21:22.523 --> 21:23.524
Is rich.

21:23.584 --> 21:26.392
Father died three years ago,
left her the family's import business.

21:26.972 --> 21:28.285
She's worth over 50 million.

21:28.396 --> 21:29.396
Bring her in.

21:29.711 --> 21:30.828
I'll send the limo.

21:37.273 --> 21:38.273
You're on.

21:38.961 --> 21:39.961
You owe me.

21:40.748 --> 21:41.748
Hello.

21:46.152 --> 21:47.152
Afternoon.

21:47.705 --> 21:50.641
Dale Kapp,
Mrs. Summers' personal attorney.

21:50.994 --> 21:52.268
Can we get this over with?

21:52.349 --> 21:54.174
Sure. This way, please.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.642
That is what they call
the eye of the cougar, probie.

22:03.901 --> 22:05.107
Isn't she married?

22:05.593 --> 22:07.158
She's a hunt jungle cat.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.118
The cougar is always on the hunt.

22:10.026 --> 22:11.717
It's the nature of the beast.

22:13.025 --> 22:14.916
I always thought
cougars like young guys.

22:22.587 --> 22:25.009
This is extremely mortifying
for my client.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.338
And while she has nothing to hide,

22:27.398 --> 22:29.406
she certainly wouldn't want it
implied in the press

22:29.466 --> 22:32.885
that she has anything to do
with your ongoing investigation.

22:32.945 --> 22:33.976
You recognize him?

22:37.784 --> 22:38.784
No.

22:40.938 --> 22:42.828
Do you recognize this?

22:44.688 --> 22:45.688
My car.

22:46.318 --> 22:47.319
Or one of them.

22:47.445 --> 22:50.284
It was involved in
a hit-and-run accident last night.

22:50.909 --> 22:53.895
But my husband and I were both
in to the evening hug

22:53.955 --> 22:55.055
getting massages.

22:55.115 --> 22:57.024
Then we'll need
to talk to your husband.

22:57.286 --> 22:58.286
You are.

23:00.537 --> 23:02.547
Dale is my current husband.

23:02.763 --> 23:03.763
Current?

23:05.038 --> 23:07.677
Right. Husband number...

23:08.817 --> 23:09.954
three.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.223
Four.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.792
Dale handled my previous divorce.

23:15.503 --> 23:16.599
Mazel tov.

23:16.659 --> 23:17.932
We never left our home.

23:17.992 --> 23:19.522
Car drove itself then?

23:19.749 --> 23:21.302
We have a dozen house employees

23:21.362 --> 23:23.351
who could have possibly accessed
the motor pool,

23:23.411 --> 23:25.194
cooks, gardeners, pool staff.

23:25.274 --> 23:26.039
Names?

23:26.099 --> 23:27.572
And we need to see the car.

23:27.828 --> 23:28.852
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:28.912 --> 23:31.152
It's being taken this afternoon
to our home in Nantucket.

23:31.332 --> 23:33.327
Actually,
it's going to the Hamptons cottage.

23:35.104 --> 23:36.285
I thought I told you

23:36.526 --> 23:39.431
we're spending Christmas in Nantucket.
Don't you ever listen?

23:39.792 --> 23:41.457
Still, we need to see the car.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.584
I'll take care of it.

23:44.907 --> 23:46.504
Are we done with these people?

23:47.468 --> 23:50.513
- Any other questions for my client?
- Need a DNA sample.

23:53.639 --> 23:56.535
Is my wife being charged,
Agent Gibbs?

23:57.541 --> 23:58.616
Not yet.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.051
Then we're leaving. Thank you.

24:07.355 --> 24:10.798
The old fingerprint-off-the-glass trick.
Who needs DNA.

24:11.506 --> 24:13.990
You're right. I need DNA.
It's my lifeblood.

24:14.906 --> 24:15.952
Okay, well,

24:16.504 --> 24:19.326
doesn't match the partial from the car.
It wasn't Tabitha.

24:19.451 --> 24:22.248
I will start rounding up their house
employees for questioning.

24:23.917 --> 24:26.106
I thought you said
her prints didn't match.

24:26.964 --> 24:28.588
That's not from Tabitha's glass.

24:28.797 --> 24:30.326
It's from her husband's,

24:30.451 --> 24:32.472
- Dale Kapp.
- Get him back here.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.529
He's probably already
off the base by now.

24:34.654 --> 24:36.445
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Cell phone.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.204
I'm already triangulating
for a signal, Gibbs.

24:39.391 --> 24:41.717
You've got to be faster than that.
Got him.

24:41.846 --> 24:45.326
He's on the phone right now,
and he's still on the base.

24:45.566 --> 24:48.297
As a matter of fact,
he is right in front of the building.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.343
That's weird.
Looks like he's driving into the lobby.

24:52.615 --> 24:54.537
DiNozzo, front gate, shut it down.

24:54.662 --> 24:56.773
Who are we stopping?
Everyone, I guess.

24:57.293 --> 24:59.128
This is
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

24:59.188 --> 25:01.616
We need to shut down the front gate.
Lock it down.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.216
- Where's your husband?
- I don't know.

25:07.528 --> 25:09.545
Spending his last few hours
as a married man?

25:09.762 --> 25:12.398
He went to get the car,
and then just drove off.

25:13.002 --> 25:14.057
Left me.

25:14.675 --> 25:17.122
First Bennett runs, and now Kapp.

25:26.096 --> 25:28.703
Maybe the only thing Kapp's running
from is his wife.

25:29.050 --> 25:30.050
Dangerous.

25:30.498 --> 25:32.942
- You know how fast a cougar can run?
- Not fast enough.

25:33.067 --> 25:34.472
She could not catch his car.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.408
Kapp must have known
we were closing in.

25:37.437 --> 25:40.259
- He's running for a reason.
- But she has no idea why.

25:40.384 --> 25:42.167
Says she has never heard of Collins.

25:42.394 --> 25:43.964
Well, Kapp obviously has.

25:44.183 --> 25:46.628
Oh, hey, boss. We got his laptop.
It's down with Abby.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.151
Spoke with the Summers' masseuse.
Kapp canceled his Shiatsu.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.635
When he was supposedly at home,
a traffic camera

25:52.760 --> 25:55.503
a mile away shows him running
a red light in the Maserati.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.951
It time-stamped yesterday, 7:16 PM,

25:58.076 --> 26:00.285
six minutes before Collins
was run off the road.

26:00.457 --> 26:04.292
That's gonna be 400 bucks for a traffic
violation, and 50 years for murder.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.519
Motive?

26:06.056 --> 26:07.728
Motive. There's a question.

26:10.404 --> 26:13.816
We cross-referenced Kapp and Collins'
cell phone records and credit cards.

26:14.433 --> 26:16.595
- We got nothing.
- No apparent connection.

26:16.865 --> 26:17.865
Collins' CO?

26:18.054 --> 26:20.559
Never heard of Kapp.
Neither have any of Collins' shipmates.

26:20.892 --> 26:22.949
Gold-digging
society lawyer and a squid

26:23.074 --> 26:26.771
who spends his spare time beating guys
to a pulp. Next, on an all-new Maury.

26:28.252 --> 26:30.285
- Yeah, Abs.
- Gibbs, can you come to the lab?

26:30.633 --> 26:31.767
Be right down.

26:31.988 --> 26:33.111
McGee. Find him.

26:33.334 --> 26:36.252
I'm checking to see if there's
any hits on the BOLO. Still nothing.

26:38.340 --> 26:42.158
But my current rank
in the air guitar competition

26:42.332 --> 26:45.245
is up with a bullet to second.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.308
You must be so proud.

26:48.377 --> 26:50.255
- You're jealous.
- Because you can air guitar?

26:50.425 --> 26:51.580
Because you can't.

26:52.390 --> 26:54.778
Tony, I've told you.
I like to have fun in more...

26:55.562 --> 26:56.656
adult ways.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.382
Reading.

26:58.693 --> 26:59.693
Yes.

26:59.932 --> 27:00.932
Reading.

27:02.632 --> 27:05.060
Look, everybody
enjoys a good book, but

27:05.442 --> 27:09.084
don't you ever have the urge
to just act a little...

27:09.316 --> 27:10.316
Childish?

27:10.744 --> 27:12.476
Silly. Stupid.

27:12.860 --> 27:14.731
- Brainless.
- Like you?

27:15.036 --> 27:16.036
Exactly.

27:16.069 --> 27:19.186
Tony, you and I come from
two totally different places.

27:19.325 --> 27:21.991
In my world, you grow up, fast.

27:22.536 --> 27:23.730
You have no choice.

27:24.319 --> 27:25.330
Now you do.

27:28.711 --> 27:32.457
I found a series of encrypted files in
a hidden partition in Kapp's computer.

27:33.005 --> 27:34.924
A lot of e-mails and
chat room conversations.

27:35.049 --> 27:37.592
Over 20 in the last month,
all from the same screen name.

27:37.967 --> 27:40.239
- J-Digg19.
- Plasma.

27:41.848 --> 27:42.848
Decrypt it.

27:45.068 --> 27:48.883
We already did, boss. It's...
well, you know, it's a chat room.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.045
It's IM-speak.

27:53.069 --> 27:55.819
You wouldn't know. It starts off with,
"Hey, how are you today?",

27:55.944 --> 27:59.352
"fine, thank you."
Gets interesting further down.

27:59.532 --> 28:01.074
He wants to know what she's wearing.

28:01.199 --> 28:03.608
Says he wants to take
her shopping for lingerie.

28:03.732 --> 28:06.800
- Then he says...
- Yeah, I get the picture. Who is she?

28:06.984 --> 28:10.123
Not his wife.
There's an embedded hyperlink.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.611
He's chatting with a Jodi,
and here's her MySpace page.

28:15.251 --> 28:17.221
Blink, McGee. It's just a girl.

28:17.424 --> 28:19.261
- What? I'm just...
- Gawking?

28:19.509 --> 28:20.683
No. Pinging.

28:21.307 --> 28:23.138
Boss,
by pinging the site's DNS cache,

28:23.323 --> 28:25.759
we can see what computer
last logged in to Jodi's page.

28:25.884 --> 28:29.285
And get the IP address,
which is registered to...

28:29.431 --> 28:31.063
205 Wilcox.

28:34.084 --> 28:35.483
Going by yourself, boss?

28:36.012 --> 28:36.946
Need...

28:37.027 --> 28:38.027
backup?

28:42.361 --> 28:44.451
Reminds me of
my first apartment in college.

28:44.745 --> 28:46.513
You can almost smell the Ikea.

28:46.638 --> 28:48.761
Come on in! Door's open.

28:51.171 --> 28:52.255
NCIS.

28:52.847 --> 28:55.627
I'll be right there.
Grab a drink if you want.

28:58.399 --> 29:00.090
Think she was expecting someone.

29:02.151 --> 29:03.151
Want a drink?

29:04.087 --> 29:05.087
Just kidding.

29:06.697 --> 29:08.642
Federal agents.
We need to talk with you.

29:08.702 --> 29:11.197
Did I mention my roommate
went home for the weekend?

29:11.698 --> 29:12.988
Nice timing?

29:13.113 --> 29:16.388
We're federal agents. We'd like
to ask you a few questions, ma'am.

29:16.513 --> 29:18.716
You know what? I got an idea.

29:18.918 --> 29:22.306
Why don't you strip down
and jump in the shower with me?

29:25.025 --> 29:27.353
No, it's not what you think.
Check it out, boss.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.914
Lipstick camera.

29:31.803 --> 29:32.957
We're being watched.

29:40.677 --> 29:41.966
There's another one.

29:45.987 --> 29:47.555
Federal agents. We're coming in.

30:01.164 --> 30:02.179
Peekaboo.

30:05.893 --> 30:07.823
You see,
things are not what they seem.

30:08.533 --> 30:10.065
Jodi's voice was prerecorded.

30:11.495 --> 30:13.209
Maybe it's
one of those voice-activated,

30:13.269 --> 30:15.758
motion-activated,
sensor thing-a-ma-jobs.

30:15.954 --> 30:17.335
You know, gets her talking.

30:18.487 --> 30:20.840
- Where's McGeek when you need him?
- I got another one.

30:25.072 --> 30:28.307
It's getting kind of lonely in here.
How long you gonna keep me waiting?

30:34.474 --> 30:36.106
Careful, boss, it might be rigged.

30:40.903 --> 30:41.905
Or not.

30:43.629 --> 30:46.893
Like a sort of a computer
storage megagiga thingy.

30:47.211 --> 30:48.565
We're not being watched.

30:49.955 --> 30:51.190
We're being recorded.

30:55.242 --> 30:57.531
It's kind of like that TV show,
To Catch a Predator.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.378
Yeah. Only,
this is more like "To Catch a Sucka".

31:00.643 --> 31:01.922
Here's how the scam works.

31:02.091 --> 31:05.300
Jodi hangs out in chat rooms,
looking for unhappily married men.

31:05.529 --> 31:07.812
Unfortunately,
when the men show up, there is no Jodi.

31:07.937 --> 31:09.111
Just video cameras.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.987
Yep. Recording everything.

31:11.292 --> 31:13.057
Then the mark
gets e-mailed a threat,

31:13.227 --> 31:16.201
saying if they want that videotape
to disappear, they got to pay.

31:16.562 --> 31:17.357
Ten Gs.

31:17.558 --> 31:19.692
I'm trying to find
the owner of the Web site now.

31:19.773 --> 31:22.787
- Lot of cash for Joe Blow.
- Blackmailer isn't targeting Joe Blow.

31:22.979 --> 31:23.696
No.

31:23.878 --> 31:25.446
He is targeting...

31:25.834 --> 31:27.834
men with rich wives.

31:27.894 --> 31:29.615
Suckas like this guy.

31:32.579 --> 31:35.413
- Dale Kapp.
- If he gets naked, I'm out of here.

31:35.583 --> 31:37.973
Video footage on this server
going back almost two years.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.350
Well, wherever Jodi is,
she's making a killing.

31:40.493 --> 31:43.068
She isn't anywhere.
She doesn't exist.

31:43.772 --> 31:45.961
I ran facial-recognition
software on Jodi.

31:46.086 --> 31:49.594
I traced the face back to a modeling
Web site in the Ukraine.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.658
- The image was stolen.
- So,

31:52.271 --> 31:54.559
who's the man
behind the shower curtain?

31:54.838 --> 31:57.836
And we have a winner.
The e-mail account is registered to...

31:59.467 --> 32:00.780
Petty Officer Collins.

32:02.834 --> 32:03.961
Got our motive.

32:04.212 --> 32:06.307
Kapp didn't want to pay
and killed Collins.

32:06.630 --> 32:10.212
BOLO came back on Kapp's town car.
It is parked outside Collins' house.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.205
Kapp's ride.

32:22.392 --> 32:23.517
Why did he come here?

32:23.577 --> 32:25.250
Probably
looking for any backup copies

32:25.375 --> 32:27.543
Collins had
of the incriminating footage.

32:28.722 --> 32:31.219
- Hood's still warm.
- Boss, I got the front.

32:55.162 --> 32:57.013
Looks like we missed another fight.

33:05.049 --> 33:07.088
Somebody just murdered our murderer.

33:19.961 --> 33:22.493
Our man has been murdered,
our killer killed.

33:23.724 --> 33:24.858
Kapp capped.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.924
He has a possible fractured skull.

33:28.660 --> 33:31.165
And there's multiple contusions
to his head.

33:31.303 --> 33:32.333
Beaten to death?

33:32.393 --> 33:36.289
The usual disclaimer until I do
a thorough examination.

33:36.673 --> 33:38.583
- Fists?
- Something harder.

33:39.939 --> 33:41.922
- With an edge.
- Boss.

33:44.832 --> 33:46.146
Like a length of wood.

33:46.422 --> 33:47.694
Got a witness, boss.

33:48.001 --> 33:50.136
There was someone here today
after lunch.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.949
One of Collins' friends:
Big guy with fair hair.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.702
I got a really good look at him.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.590
Sam Bennett.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.207
Got a BOLO out in every homeless shelter
in Norfolk, boss.

34:01.501 --> 34:02.959
Coordinate with Norfolk PD.

34:03.436 --> 34:04.441
Already done.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.493
Bennett must have known
something we didn't.

34:07.252 --> 34:08.891
Found out Kapp was the killer.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.637
- He did say he would get payback.
- And he did.

34:12.762 --> 34:15.960
Beat Kapp to a pulp with a 2x4
after we released him.

34:16.157 --> 34:17.987
- Where is he going?
- Well,

34:18.588 --> 34:20.399
doesn't have any family. No money.

34:20.616 --> 34:22.964
BOLO doesn't come back soon,
he's gonna disappear.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.899
You need to unplug yourself
from the Matrix,

34:26.079 --> 34:28.308
do some old-school sleuthing,
Pinkerton.

34:29.002 --> 34:30.878
It's all about asking
the right question.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.406
Well, ask away, DiNozzo.

34:32.574 --> 34:35.545
Why did Kapp rabbit out of here,
leaving his wife behind?

34:35.606 --> 34:37.416
Why did he go straight to
Collins' house?

34:37.476 --> 34:39.746
And how did Bennett
know to find him there?

34:39.916 --> 34:41.748
- He didn't find him.
- He lured him.

34:42.089 --> 34:44.583
Easy enough all Bennett had to do
was phone Kapp,

34:44.708 --> 34:47.713
tell him he had a couple of photos
of him showing up to Jodi's apartment.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.521
Running Kapp's cell phone records.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.239
There.

34:56.038 --> 34:58.389
Got a call after
he left us and dumped his wife.

34:59.212 --> 35:01.600
- Bennett.
- Tracing the call.

35:02.614 --> 35:05.304
Came from Collins' house.
Bennett must have been there.

35:05.429 --> 35:06.802
Left before we arrived.

35:09.434 --> 35:11.163
Got it. Collins' phone records.

35:11.402 --> 35:13.816
Five calls to his house
from a pay phone located at...

35:13.941 --> 35:17.283
Western Dock. Where the USS Rubicon
is being decommissioned.

35:17.692 --> 35:18.692
Gear up.

35:20.356 --> 35:23.743
- How's that for old-school slothing?
- Sleuthing, having fun yet?

35:28.362 --> 35:31.214
No one home.
Salvage guys have called it a day.

35:32.262 --> 35:33.436
Hey, keep it down.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.570
Sorry.

35:52.616 --> 35:54.851
- Lost the lights.
- Knows we're here.

36:05.943 --> 36:08.232
Found Bennett's crash pad, boss.

36:15.735 --> 36:18.343
Why does it always
have to be rats and boats?

36:28.425 --> 36:29.907
McGee, heading your way.

36:38.210 --> 36:40.021
Federal agent, stay where you are.

36:40.801 --> 36:42.871
Boss, C-deck,
heading towards the bow.

36:58.057 --> 36:59.390
Status, McGee.

37:04.915 --> 37:07.059
- Anybody got eyes on McGee?
- Negative.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.895
No sign of him, boss.

37:13.995 --> 37:14.995
Got him.

37:17.467 --> 37:18.701
Way to go, McGee.

37:19.139 --> 37:22.246
Taking down the fight club champ.
I'm almost impressed.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.935
Well, I would be, too, except

37:25.060 --> 37:27.606
he fell over and hit his head
while he was trying to get away.

37:31.947 --> 37:34.009
You killed him. You killed Kapp.

37:34.103 --> 37:34.803
No.

37:34.863 --> 37:37.537
You beat him to death with
a lump of wood, not your fists.

37:37.922 --> 37:38.922
No!

37:39.099 --> 37:41.049
Perhaps not the fighter
you think you are.

37:42.386 --> 37:45.158
It wasn't me. It wasn't.

37:52.743 --> 37:54.733
McGee, I'm busy.

37:55.078 --> 37:57.360
If I find anything,
you will be the second to know.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.737
I'm up to my choker collar
in dried blood

37:59.862 --> 38:02.198
and partial fingerprints
and wood splinters.

38:02.401 --> 38:04.908
Gibbs wants anything
I can find to pressure Bennett.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.269
Then, why are you running
a WHO-IS search?

38:07.790 --> 38:10.952
I found some anomalies in
the extortion e-mails Kapp received.

38:11.077 --> 38:13.626
I'm trying to track down
the source of a header mismatch.

38:16.906 --> 38:17.980
I got a ding.

38:21.610 --> 38:22.903
Now, that's a ding.

38:23.362 --> 38:24.637
That's not a ding.

38:25.364 --> 38:26.578
That's a leech.

38:27.143 --> 38:28.711
I told you, it wasn't me.

38:36.767 --> 38:39.652
You told Agent Gibbs
you would kill whoever

38:39.871 --> 38:42.975
was responsible
for Petty Officer Collins' death.

38:43.209 --> 38:45.516
When you found out it was Kapp,

38:45.766 --> 38:47.413
you called him from Collins' house.

38:48.429 --> 38:50.333
- I wasn't at the house.
- Yes, you were.

38:50.414 --> 38:52.834
- No, I wasn't.
- We have a witness who saw you there.

38:58.331 --> 38:59.502
I didn't do it.

39:06.015 --> 39:08.184
Do you know what a lineup is, Sam?

39:14.815 --> 39:16.072
All right, thank you.

39:16.589 --> 39:18.380
Hey, thanks for coming, Mr. Parker.

39:18.534 --> 39:20.464
Just doing my civic duty,
Agent Gibbs.

39:32.351 --> 39:33.458
That's him.

39:34.581 --> 39:35.904
That's the man I saw.

39:42.157 --> 39:45.958
That's him, that's the guy,
the one I saw at Greg's house.

39:48.683 --> 39:49.778
What is this?

39:50.395 --> 39:53.131
Well, you've just been identified
by an eyewitness who

39:53.256 --> 39:55.516
saw you beat Dale Kapp
to death this afternoon.

39:55.641 --> 39:56.874
You believe him?

39:57.586 --> 39:59.357
No, no, not just him.

39:59.552 --> 40:02.437
Collins' Wi-Fi signal
wasn't password-protected.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.018
As a result,
anyone could use it, and you did.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.647
Called leeching.

40:08.496 --> 40:12.147
They traced the sender, they would have
ended up at Collins' house, not yours.

40:12.405 --> 40:13.718
You were the leech.

40:14.789 --> 40:17.128
Guess Kapp didn't want to pay up,
came looking for you.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.060
- Found Collins.
- I'm not saying anything.

40:21.457 --> 40:24.362
You don't have to.
We got enough on you anyway.

40:32.986 --> 40:34.339
You can shut it off.

40:41.846 --> 40:43.817
I was gonna stay at Greg's house.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.671
Look after his stuff, you know?

40:48.278 --> 40:49.532
I was in the bedroom...

40:51.527 --> 40:53.815
and I heard the back door open,

40:55.436 --> 40:58.202
so I hid.
Didn't want to get in trouble.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.347
It was that guy, Parker.

41:04.339 --> 41:06.346
Used the phone, made a call.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.442
The man that killed Greg.

41:13.588 --> 41:14.838
Pay up or else.

41:16.964 --> 41:18.091
So, I waited.

41:18.839 --> 41:20.427
I wanted to see who he was.

41:21.707 --> 41:24.712
And then, when he got there,
Parker hit him with a piece of wood.

41:27.729 --> 41:28.776
And hit him.

41:30.033 --> 41:32.390
And... I just stood there...

41:36.170 --> 41:38.500
watching from the window,
and I didn't...

41:43.502 --> 41:44.876
I didn't stop him.

41:48.985 --> 41:50.816
Because I wanted him dead, too.

42:04.052 --> 42:07.571
Midnight screening of GoodFellas tonight
at the multiplex you want to come?

42:07.812 --> 42:10.240
No, not tonight.

42:11.276 --> 42:12.698
All right, enjoy the book.
