WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.160
Welcome to all five of you

00:02.235 --> 00:04.227
to Private Investigation 101.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.097
We're on a field trip. Relax

00:07.174 --> 00:09.642
I thought we were looking
for Stacy's lost boyfriend.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.939
Hey, trust the teach.
He can handle himself.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.177
I wanna know where Ted is.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.844
This wasn't just
a classroom exercise to me.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.546
<i>Ted is in real trouble.</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:23.681
What in God's name have
you done to Mildred's room?

00:23.758 --> 00:26.454
The trash is part of
a lesson plan, Gaylord.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.188
This class is canceled.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.593
Whoa, bummer.

01:51.430 --> 01:52.692
You sure
you have everything?

01:52.765 --> 01:54.323
I got everything.
I'm all set, sweetheart.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.890
Okay. I'm gonna
miss you.

01:55.968 --> 01:57.367
I'm gonna
miss you too, baby.

02:01.874 --> 02:03.205
I'll go park
and meet you at the gate.

02:03.276 --> 02:05.039
Nah, there's not enough time,
sweetheart.

02:05.111 --> 02:06.442
I better just
make a run for it.

02:06.512 --> 02:07.945
I gotta go.

02:08.580 --> 02:09.946
Bye-bye.

02:10.383 --> 02:11.441
Wait. Kiss.

02:11.684 --> 02:12.673
Oh.

02:13.286 --> 02:14.275
I love you.

02:14.754 --> 02:17.052
Give me a call.
Let me know
where you're staying.

02:17.623 --> 02:19.784
Yeah.
Yeah, I promise. Bye-bye.

02:27.466 --> 02:28.592
Hey, you can't park here.

02:28.668 --> 02:29.657
Five minutes. I'm...

02:29.735 --> 02:31.669
It's a loading zone.
I'm meeting someone.

02:56.996 --> 03:00.261
<i>Last call for flight 241</i>
<i>to Seattle.</i>

03:00.333 --> 03:03.598
<i>Last call for flight 241</i>
<i>to Seattle.</i>

03:05.771 --> 03:08.103
My boyfriend
left his ticket in the car.

03:08.174 --> 03:10.233
Do you have someone
looking for a ticket?

03:13.045 --> 03:15.639
That plane
is departing right now.
Well, he...

03:18.784 --> 03:19.842
Sorry.

03:19.919 --> 03:21.546
Well, he can't have left.

03:21.954 --> 03:23.649
Thank you. There you go.

03:23.723 --> 03:24.917
Yeah, thanks.

03:25.658 --> 03:27.649
Thank you.
Have a nice day,
Mr. Hazlett.

03:38.571 --> 03:41.039
Surveillance
of any kind requires

03:41.107 --> 03:43.541
a high degree
of professionalism.

03:44.877 --> 03:47.368
Tailing the target requires

03:47.646 --> 03:49.705
intense concentration.

03:49.849 --> 03:51.612
Relax for even a second,

03:51.884 --> 03:54.546
and he or she
could simply vanish.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.187
Or even worse,

03:56.255 --> 03:57.483
if you allow he or she

03:57.556 --> 04:00.389
to recognize you
as an adversary,

04:00.459 --> 04:02.654
then he or she

04:02.728 --> 04:05.253
might instigate
direct confrontation,

04:05.965 --> 04:07.660
which the Surgeon General
has declared to be

04:07.733 --> 04:09.360
Hazardous to your health.

04:09.602 --> 04:11.035
Strike that. That stinks.

04:11.103 --> 04:13.298
Your discretion
is commendable.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.466
Higgins, don't you ever knock?

04:15.574 --> 04:18.475
I just discovered
Mr. Masters' stereo wall

04:18.543 --> 04:20.375
has an ugly, gaping wound

04:20.446 --> 04:21.970
on the left side.

04:22.214 --> 04:24.580
Oh, I'm sorry, Higgins.

04:24.650 --> 04:27.244
Look, I'll put it back
just as soon as I finish

04:27.319 --> 04:28.513
my idea vocabulary.

04:28.587 --> 04:33.183
<i>Look. Dare to Achieve.</i>
<i>A Guidebook</i>
<i>to Successful Motivation.</i>

04:33.459 --> 04:36.155
See, I'm using it
to prepare
my first lesson plan.

04:36.262 --> 04:38.230
See, the way you get your
idea vocabulary

04:38.297 --> 04:39.764
is you let all your thoughts

04:39.832 --> 04:42.528
just kinda drop
out of your brain
in no particular order,

04:42.601 --> 04:45.570
and then you
store them on tape
for future use.

04:45.838 --> 04:47.237
You dropped one.

04:47.907 --> 04:49.738
Oh, that's pizza.

04:50.009 --> 04:53.945
I didn't
have time to stop work
and take a break, Higgins.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.947
It didn't get down
on the machine.

04:56.015 --> 04:59.280
Surely a highly sensitive
$2,000 recording device

04:59.351 --> 05:00.477
merits better use

05:00.553 --> 05:03.488
than the logging
of non-sequitured musings

05:03.656 --> 05:06.284
and the indignity
of mozzarella droppings.

05:06.425 --> 05:08.825
Higgins, please,
at least let me

05:08.994 --> 05:10.985
play back what I've done
and take some notes.

05:11.063 --> 05:12.428
I've got
my first class tomorrow

05:12.498 --> 05:13.760
and I don't have
a lesson plan.

05:13.833 --> 05:16.233
Magnum, how long have
you known that you were
going to teach this course?

05:16.302 --> 05:17.462
Two weeks!

05:17.670 --> 05:19.638
But, I mean,
I've been busy on a case,
Higgins.

05:19.705 --> 05:22.799
I mean, after all,
that's why they asked me
to teach the class, remember?

05:22.875 --> 05:25.139
I am a working
private investigator.

05:25.244 --> 05:27.439
Certainly not because you're
on a volleyball team

05:27.513 --> 05:29.947
with the Director of Adult
Education of the college.

05:30.015 --> 05:31.004
No.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.809
Okay, so Dave Gibson and I

05:33.886 --> 05:36.980
play an occasional game
of volleyball. Big deal.

05:37.623 --> 05:41.457
You really expect
to fill 20 hours
with this course?

05:42.528 --> 05:45.463
Aren't you afraid you'll be
overdrawn at your idea bank?

05:45.531 --> 05:47.795
It's idea vocabulary,
Higgins, and please,

05:47.867 --> 05:49.926
just let me keep it
for this chapter.

05:51.904 --> 05:55.135
You know, Kenji was suddenly
called away from
the estate this morning.

05:55.341 --> 05:56.831
A death in the family.

05:56.909 --> 05:58.536
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.307
What's this got to do
with your generosity?

06:03.415 --> 06:06.680
Well, he was in the midst of
fertilizing the hibiscus beds.

06:06.919 --> 06:09.479
Someone needs to finish it.
I haven't the time.

06:11.557 --> 06:14.117
Sure.
How difficult could that be?

06:14.193 --> 06:17.219
And the hibiscus needs only
one more ton of manure.
A ton?

06:17.329 --> 06:19.297
Do you want
the tape recorder or not?

06:22.368 --> 06:23.494
All right.

06:23.869 --> 06:25.632
But for a ton of manure,
I get to keep it

06:25.704 --> 06:27.865
for as long as
I'm teaching the class.

06:28.641 --> 06:31.303
Your class will
probably be canceled
after today.

06:31.377 --> 06:33.845
Oh, no, no.
It's right here
in your prospectus.

06:34.179 --> 06:36.238
"Private Investigation 101.

06:36.315 --> 06:40.308
"A fascinating in-depth study
of the world
of private investigation

06:40.486 --> 06:44.047
"taught by professional
private investigator,
Thomas Magnum. 20 hours."

06:44.123 --> 06:46.455
Provided there is sufficient
interest in the course

06:46.525 --> 06:48.083
to provide minimum enrollment.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.527
Oh, it's no problem.
Dave is expecting
a big sign-up.

06:51.597 --> 06:53.087
Mr. Magnum,

06:53.165 --> 06:57.727
Mr. Gibson
is a very fine administrator.

06:58.804 --> 07:02.103
However,
his impulsive additions
to our curriculum in the past

07:02.174 --> 07:04.938
have proven to be
unsuccessful experiments.

07:06.312 --> 07:09.804
He felt passionately
about a course called
Ocean Hydrodynamics.

07:09.882 --> 07:12.976
It had a total enrollment
of one. Himself.

07:14.787 --> 07:16.914
Mr. Gaylord,

07:16.989 --> 07:20.083
this is not
Ocean Hydrodynamics, okay?

07:20.593 --> 07:23.824
I am teaching
a beginner's class
in a profession.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.090
Perhaps.

07:25.531 --> 07:29.433
But you will admit that
in the general body
of our other offerings,

07:29.635 --> 07:32.297
it does appear
to be rather superfluous.

07:32.471 --> 07:35.565
No. No, I won't admit that.
Look at this.

07:35.641 --> 07:38.576
"Eighteenth Century
Portuguese Literature,

07:38.744 --> 07:42.373
"Politics of the Vatican,
1919 to 1933,

07:42.448 --> 07:44.109
"A History
of European Metallurgy."

07:44.183 --> 07:45.980
And you call
my course superfluous?

07:46.051 --> 07:48.679
Room 214.
Look at this.
This one's so superfluous

07:48.754 --> 07:52.190
it's already been canceled.
"Applied Metaphysics,
Mildred Gaylord."

07:52.391 --> 07:53.380
Geez.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.821
My wife.

07:59.965 --> 08:02.798
Her course was canceled
by a Mr. Gibson

08:04.003 --> 08:05.937
to make room for yours.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.675
Well, good luck
with your enrollment,
Mr. Magnum.

08:10.743 --> 08:13.041
I will be very interested
in the total.

08:14.146 --> 08:17.547
The college has a policy.
Eight students per course.

08:17.750 --> 08:18.944
Eight?

08:20.619 --> 08:22.553
All I need is eight?

08:23.188 --> 08:24.177
Eight.

08:25.524 --> 08:27.788
Welcome to all five of you

08:29.228 --> 08:30.718
to Private Investigation 101.

08:30.796 --> 08:34.892
I'm sure there'll be lots
more students coming along
in just a few minutes.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.966
In the meantime...

08:47.212 --> 08:48.941
Thomas

08:52.051 --> 08:53.382
Magnum.

08:57.022 --> 08:58.853
You can call me...

08:58.924 --> 09:00.949
You can call me
anything you want.

09:05.964 --> 09:07.056
Right.

09:07.966 --> 09:10.400
Well, I was planning
on dividing this class

09:11.203 --> 09:12.227
into two parts.

09:12.304 --> 09:14.864
The first part will be
the classroom lectures,

09:14.940 --> 09:18.000
and then the second part...
I think you're going
to like this.

09:18.544 --> 09:21.479
The second part will be
where we go
out on the streets

09:21.547 --> 09:24.380
for what I call
an actual field study case.

09:24.683 --> 09:26.617
What kind of field study case?

09:26.685 --> 09:28.880
Well, I'm glad you asked that
because that's what we need.

09:28.954 --> 09:31.514
We need some
classroom participation.
What's your name?

09:31.824 --> 09:32.984
Merle.

09:33.459 --> 09:35.256
What kind of field study case?

09:35.327 --> 09:38.854
Well, I was planning
to use a case that,

09:38.931 --> 09:41.422
that I had already solved
a couple of years ago

09:41.500 --> 09:44.799
and then re-enacting
my investigative procedure.

09:44.870 --> 09:47.998
What if somebody in the class
has some cases
that weren't solved?

09:48.440 --> 09:50.067
Now, why can't we
work on that?

09:50.209 --> 09:51.801
That's a great idea!

09:52.344 --> 09:54.312
Mrs. Anawahi. Elena.

09:54.580 --> 09:57.981
I have a half dozen cases
to work on. Bad checks.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.275
Elena's Gift Shop
on Diamond Head.

10:00.452 --> 10:02.943
The amount's too small
for the police
to take care of,

10:03.088 --> 10:05.249
so I thought I'd learn
how to do it myself.

10:05.324 --> 10:07.724
You're welcome to help me find
some of these deadbeats.

10:07.793 --> 10:10.853
After we catch the louse
that sold me the junk truck.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.390
I paid this dude...

10:12.464 --> 10:15.024
Hold it. Hold it, hold it.

10:15.834 --> 10:19.827
Merle, I don't think
a real case is a good idea.

10:19.872 --> 10:21.066
Why not?

10:21.707 --> 10:24.835
Because you're only paying
$25 for the course.

10:24.977 --> 10:26.808
That's not the point.
See, the point is,

10:27.146 --> 10:29.444
if we go out on
one of your cases...

10:29.515 --> 10:31.745
Well, you'll be happy to know
I don't have one.

10:32.017 --> 10:33.006
Ah.

10:33.786 --> 10:36.482
Kiana Dau.
I'm a journalism major.

10:36.689 --> 10:38.816
Here strictly for research.

10:39.058 --> 10:40.286
Is she right, Magnum?

10:40.426 --> 10:42.360
You think we're here
trying to rip you off?

10:42.428 --> 10:43.417
No.

10:44.163 --> 10:46.188
No, that's not the case
at all. It's just...

10:46.432 --> 10:49.458
It's hard enough for one guy
to tail a suspect,

10:50.002 --> 10:52.630
But can you imagine
how conspicuous six of us...

10:55.174 --> 10:57.404
Seven of us.

10:57.476 --> 10:59.171
Seven of us would be?

10:59.245 --> 11:01.975
I mean,
that's why a real case just...

11:02.047 --> 11:03.275
It just doesn't work.

11:04.683 --> 11:06.014
P.I. 101?

11:06.352 --> 11:08.718
Private Investigation 101.

11:08.787 --> 11:11.119
That is,
if we get two more students.

11:12.825 --> 11:15.623
Stacy Dayton.
I'm sorry I'm late.

11:15.961 --> 11:19.158
Why can't you take us out
investigating a few at a time?

11:19.532 --> 11:21.227
Maybe have more than one case.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.599
No...
See, that is another problem.

11:25.170 --> 11:28.105
Elena, you and Merle both

11:28.173 --> 11:29.572
have people that you
want to find.

11:29.642 --> 11:30.973
I mean, how could we

11:31.043 --> 11:32.977
possibly choose
which one to pursue?

11:33.045 --> 11:34.034
Right.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.040
I mean, would you stop giving
Mr. Magnum such a hard time?

11:38.250 --> 11:42.016
I mean, he's already got this
nice, pre-solved case for us

11:42.087 --> 11:43.076
all worked out.

11:43.355 --> 11:45.220
I mean, we should be grateful.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.324
Yeah. Well, not me.

11:48.394 --> 11:50.294
Adios.
Fine. No, fine.

11:50.596 --> 11:51.585
That's fine.

11:54.366 --> 11:56.493
We'll do a show of hands.

11:56.569 --> 11:58.935
First Elena's check bouncers

11:59.004 --> 12:01.905
and then Merle's
truck salesman.

12:01.974 --> 12:02.963
Thank you.

12:03.709 --> 12:07.076
Well, hey.
Like, what about
everybody else, huh?

12:07.546 --> 12:09.514
I mean,
can't we have problems, too?

12:09.582 --> 12:11.277
Okay, you got a prob...

12:12.918 --> 12:16.046
If you have a problem,
all of you, any of you,

12:16.121 --> 12:21.081
just write it down
on a piece of paper.

12:22.161 --> 12:23.287
Okay?

12:23.362 --> 12:25.728
You know? If you have one.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.959
Now, just write
'em down

12:31.937 --> 12:33.131
on a piece of paper,

12:33.205 --> 12:36.732
and then
we'll put them
in this,

12:36.909 --> 12:40.606
and whichever one we choose
will be our case.

12:40.679 --> 12:42.772
Okay? Is that fair?

12:45.017 --> 12:47.281
Hey, you're doing
the right thing, you know?

12:47.386 --> 12:49.115
I mean,
like a real case.

12:49.321 --> 12:52.552
Yeah, we'll be having
a real P.I. Experience,
you know?

12:53.792 --> 12:56.625
Private investigation can be
great fun. What is your name?

12:57.062 --> 12:58.051
Danny.

12:58.564 --> 13:00.361
Yeah, like my old man
was on my case

13:00.432 --> 13:02.423
about getting a job
and stuff, you know.

13:02.501 --> 13:05.698
So I go, "Hey."
I mean, there's worse ways
to earn a living, right?

13:05.971 --> 13:07.734
Well, I mean, you work
your own hours,

13:07.806 --> 13:09.774
you pull down
the big bucks. Yeah.

13:09.842 --> 13:11.139
Girls really dig it, too,
right?

13:11.210 --> 13:12.973
Like it's pretty
laid back, huh?

13:13.045 --> 13:14.774
Sure. And after
you finish this,

13:14.847 --> 13:16.508
all you need
are 2,000 hours

13:16.582 --> 13:19.107
of investigative work
to get your license.

13:19.251 --> 13:20.946
Two thousand?

13:21.286 --> 13:22.446
Whoa, bummer.

13:22.521 --> 13:25.046
Where did you
get your experience,
Mr. Magnum?

13:25.591 --> 13:26.683
Well...

13:26.759 --> 13:28.590
Naval Intelligence.

13:29.094 --> 13:31.324
He was a Lieutenant Commander.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.924
I'm a retired librarian.
Albert Leonard.

13:37.770 --> 13:41.501
I just did a little
basic research on you.

13:42.441 --> 13:44.932
First step in
an investigation, I believe?

13:49.181 --> 13:50.580
Four.

13:50.716 --> 13:53.082
Four potential cases.

13:53.819 --> 13:54.877
Kiana,

13:56.889 --> 13:59.756
since you don't have a case,
why don't you hold that,

13:59.825 --> 14:00.814
and...

14:01.660 --> 14:02.649
Albert.

14:02.728 --> 14:03.786
Albert, why don't...

14:03.862 --> 14:06.057
You don't have
a case either,
so if you'll pick them,

14:06.131 --> 14:08.326
we'll make that
as fair as possible.

14:15.474 --> 14:18.568
"I am running for my life
from an unfriendly
foreign power.

14:18.644 --> 14:22.136
"If I don't find the hit man
in 24 hours,

14:22.715 --> 14:24.239
"like, I'm dead, man."

14:29.655 --> 14:32.920
Well, I just put that in there
for laughs, you know?

14:33.459 --> 14:35.552
I didn't figure you'd pick it
or anything.

14:48.207 --> 14:50.471
"I think my fiancé
is cheating on me."

14:59.017 --> 15:00.211
I'm sorry.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.317
I really do need help.

15:04.056 --> 15:05.921
I have to find him.

15:07.559 --> 15:08.753
Please help me.

15:11.263 --> 15:13.163
And then
the ticket agent assured me

15:13.232 --> 15:16.224
that no T. Hazlett
got on that flight to Seattle.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.865
And a girlfriend of mine
swears that she saw Ted

15:20.939 --> 15:24.170
coming out of a bar last night
on the North Shore.

15:24.610 --> 15:28.478
Well, we'll do some checking
between now
and the next class.

15:29.548 --> 15:32.073
If he's on the island,
he shouldn't be
too hard to find.

15:32.751 --> 15:35.242
The class,
Mr. Magnum,

15:35.721 --> 15:37.951
if you don't get
enough students
to continue,

15:38.023 --> 15:39.752
would you still help me
find Ted?

15:40.793 --> 15:42.420
I can't pay
your regular fee, but...

15:42.494 --> 15:43.483
Stacy,

15:43.595 --> 15:45.290
there is going to be a class.

15:45.364 --> 15:48.094
I think I can round up
a couple of more students.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.828
In the meantime,
just try not to worry.

15:49.902 --> 15:52.462
I'm sure there's
a very innocent explanation.

15:53.672 --> 15:54.661
Okay.

15:55.574 --> 15:58.236
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
And thank you.

16:14.292 --> 16:17.955
Theodore Allen Hazlett.

16:27.538 --> 16:31.599
Born August 27th, 1956
in Phoenix, Arizona.

16:31.676 --> 16:34.509
Graduated Central Arizona
University, 1979

16:34.579 --> 16:36.410
with a degree
in business administration.

16:37.181 --> 16:39.081
Moved to Hawaii in 1981,

16:39.150 --> 16:42.381
currently employed as
an officer with
Huiia Savings and Loan.

16:43.388 --> 16:46.221
His father was an only child
and his mother

16:46.724 --> 16:48.624
has one deceased brother.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.053
Therefore, we must conclude

16:51.129 --> 16:55.031
that he had no plans
to visit a sick uncle
in Seattle, as he told Stacy.

16:56.901 --> 16:58.061
He did lie to me.

16:58.736 --> 17:01.261
Whoa, gnarly!

17:03.608 --> 17:05.576
Any questions up till now?

17:13.518 --> 17:14.746
T. C?

17:15.453 --> 17:18.752
Your knowledge of the target
is most impressive.

17:18.823 --> 17:21.815
Can you tell us how you
collect your information?

17:24.328 --> 17:26.762
It's a basic skill
of investigative work.

17:26.830 --> 17:29.493
A very long
and tedious process.

17:31.402 --> 17:33.029
Records research?

17:34.038 --> 17:36.063
Right, Albert.
Records, like...

17:36.140 --> 17:39.166
The DMV, voters registration,
coroner's reports,

17:39.243 --> 17:40.335
court records,

17:40.411 --> 17:43.380
and some key people
who provide inside
street information,

17:43.448 --> 17:46.315
or something
along those lines.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.474
Among other things, yes.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.151
T. C: I've heard that

17:50.621 --> 17:54.887
some private investigators
don't even do any of that
bone-numbing research.

17:55.326 --> 17:58.022
That they actually
con other people
to do it for them.

17:58.096 --> 17:59.461
Yes, I've heard that also.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.555
But, surely
that can't be true.

18:04.902 --> 18:06.335
Getting back to Ted.

18:06.404 --> 18:09.931
The first step
in a missing persons
investigation...

18:10.374 --> 18:12.069
Mr. Magnum,

18:12.343 --> 18:13.867
you haven't
answered the question.

18:15.146 --> 18:18.013
I'm afraid little purpose
would be served by an answer,
Miss Dau,

18:18.082 --> 18:19.777
since I have
the unfortunate duty

18:19.851 --> 18:21.876
to post a cancellation
to this class.

18:21.953 --> 18:25.252
I find only six enrollments.

18:25.323 --> 18:28.918
I think if you count heads
again, Mr. Gaylord,
you'll come up with eight.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.335
Please come to
the office immediately
after the bell.

18:39.604 --> 18:41.731
We do have
a sign-up procedure.

18:43.341 --> 18:46.435
Should anyone wish to know,
today is
the semester deadline

18:46.511 --> 18:47.773
for dropping out
of a course

18:47.845 --> 18:50.313
and receiving
a full refund.

18:51.916 --> 18:52.905
Good day.

18:57.855 --> 19:01.916
It's official! P.I. 101...

19:01.993 --> 19:04.461
Private Investigation 101
is in!

19:04.529 --> 19:06.997
Whoa, radical!

19:08.166 --> 19:10.726
All right!
Now, as I was saying,
the first step

19:10.802 --> 19:12.736
in a missing persons
investigation

19:12.804 --> 19:15.329
is to visit the target's
last known whereabouts.

19:16.541 --> 19:20.033
But since in this case
he was last seen
at a very large airport,

19:20.111 --> 19:22.671
we have to take
the next most logical step.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.675
His last alleged whereabouts.

19:24.749 --> 19:27.115
Danny, the bar is just
a couple of more miles.

19:27.185 --> 19:28.675
It's The Pipeline,
right, Stacy?

19:28.753 --> 19:30.983
Yeah. That's where Deborah
said she saw him.

19:31.055 --> 19:33.785
Hey, like, you think I can get
some mileage money?

19:33.991 --> 19:36.721
I mean, nobody told me
we were gonna carpool it.

19:37.495 --> 19:39.486
I'll pay for the beers
when we get there.

19:39.564 --> 19:42.032
All right. I'm totally stoked.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.894
I haven't done anything
like this since Y-Camp.

19:44.969 --> 19:48.461
Right. I haven't had
this much fun since basic
at Parris Island.

19:48.873 --> 19:53.742
Aw, come on, Merle,
we're on a field trip.
Relax and enjoy the party.

19:54.212 --> 19:56.112
Now, remember,
when we go in the place,

19:56.180 --> 19:58.876
it's doubles and singles,
and you don't know me.

19:59.817 --> 20:01.751
So then how are you gonna
pay for the beer, huh?

20:01.819 --> 20:05.311
I'll handle it, Danny.
Order all you want.

20:07.425 --> 20:08.585
That's a lot of beer.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.752
These boys drink
their weight in beer.

20:10.828 --> 20:11.886
You wanna buy them
all they want?

20:11.963 --> 20:13.123
Yeah.

20:13.197 --> 20:14.630
And anybody else who comes in.

20:14.699 --> 20:15.688
Yeah, well,

20:15.766 --> 20:17.427
we don't get
that much business
this time of day.

20:17.501 --> 20:18.490
Well...

20:25.409 --> 20:27.502
Hey, how are you doing, man?
Good.

20:32.483 --> 20:33.814
All right.

20:51.636 --> 20:53.797
Drinks on the house!
This guy's buying.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.031
Thank you, thank you.
That's so sweet...

20:58.109 --> 20:59.701
Great. Radical.
Thank you.

21:02.647 --> 21:04.547
You always go around
buying people beers?

21:05.383 --> 21:09.251
No, actually,
I'm just kind of celebrating.

21:09.553 --> 21:12.852
I came into some money.
An aunt I didn't even know.

21:15.092 --> 21:16.389
Guess you never will now.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.618
No.

21:18.963 --> 21:21.431
Yeah, I'm just paying off
some old debts.

21:21.499 --> 21:24.525
Listen, I hear Ted Hazlett
drops in here occasionally.

21:24.602 --> 21:27.070
I owe him a couple of hundred.
You seen him lately?

21:28.873 --> 21:31.137
Saw this on a late movie.

21:31.842 --> 21:32.900
What?

21:32.977 --> 21:34.137
Dane Clark.

21:34.912 --> 21:37.073
Tried to pull
the same con you are.

21:37.581 --> 21:39.674
Maybe 1948, '50s.

21:40.284 --> 21:41.615
Guess I missed it.

21:41.686 --> 21:43.483
Guess you missed Hazlett, too.

21:43.554 --> 21:46.022
Now, I don't know him.
Are you still buying?

21:51.295 --> 21:52.387
Yeah.

21:52.463 --> 21:53.452
Good.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.828
There you go, brother.

21:57.902 --> 21:59.233
Thank you, my man.

22:15.686 --> 22:18.746
Well, I hope you find this
Hazlett before
your money runs out.

22:19.590 --> 22:20.921
Yeah. You know Ted Hazlett?

22:20.992 --> 22:21.981
What?

22:22.059 --> 22:23.959
Ted. You know him?

22:24.729 --> 22:26.993
Well, yeah,
he's a close friend of mine.

22:28.232 --> 22:29.392
He's a buddy of mine, too.

22:29.467 --> 22:30.593
You're kidding?

22:30.668 --> 22:31.862
No.

22:48.319 --> 22:49.946
Did you see that?

22:55.893 --> 22:57.884
I'm a little worried
about our friend Ted.

22:57.995 --> 22:59.587
What do you mean?
Shipley.

23:01.132 --> 23:02.565
Where's Hazlett?

23:03.267 --> 23:05.701
I don't know. I just...

23:06.604 --> 23:09.004
Please, Merle, can't you
just go and check on him?

23:09.073 --> 23:11.268
I think she's right.
Listen, he could be
in trouble.

23:11.342 --> 23:13.105
This other guy went in there
just before him.

23:13.177 --> 23:16.044
Well, hey, men do that
a lot in men's rooms,
you know?

23:16.147 --> 23:19.082
I mean, like there's
usually room for at least two.

23:20.885 --> 23:22.716
Girls, wait a minute.
You can't go in there.

23:22.787 --> 23:25.688
Look, he doesn't
wanna know us, remember?
Remember?

23:25.756 --> 23:28.782
Hey, trust the teach.
He can handle himself.

23:30.561 --> 23:33.860
I wanna know where Ted is.
Spill it. Now!

23:35.466 --> 23:36.228
Help!

23:37.134 --> 23:38.226
Come on, Shipley.

23:38.302 --> 23:39.701
Are you all right?

23:45.576 --> 23:47.635
Hey, brah.
Thanks for the beer.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.578
Well, at least we know
Ted isn't cheating on Stacy.

23:56.654 --> 23:57.916
Well, I mean,
if the only thing

23:57.988 --> 23:59.114
he were doing
were cheating,

23:59.190 --> 24:02.216
why would those other two men
be so adamant
about finding him?

24:02.293 --> 24:05.387
Maybe they were
the other woman's brothers.

24:06.263 --> 24:08.094
Stacy,
you ever seen them before?

24:08.165 --> 24:09.564
I don't think so.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.695
I didn't get
a very good look
at them.

24:13.204 --> 24:16.799
Danny, it's the Halona Motel.
Turn left on Kalani.

24:18.309 --> 24:21.335
The barmaid said
Ted's staying there.

24:21.645 --> 24:23.340
How does she know?

24:23.881 --> 24:27.647
She noticed the motel key
on the table
when she served him.

24:27.852 --> 24:29.581
He had his name on the key?

24:31.522 --> 24:32.648
Uh-oh.

24:33.657 --> 24:36.490
Just because she knew
the name of the motel

24:36.560 --> 24:38.357
doesn't mean...
And the room number.

24:39.330 --> 24:40.558
And the room number.

24:41.132 --> 24:43.123
It doesn't mean
that she stayed here with him.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.189
Stacy.

24:44.268 --> 24:45.428
She said she remembered him

24:45.503 --> 24:47.733
because he was
dressed so nicely.

24:47.805 --> 24:48.794
Stacy.

24:48.873 --> 24:52.468
I mean, she probably just
asked him his name.
Did you ever think of that?

24:52.543 --> 24:55.034
Stacy, you're the one who said
he was cheating on you.

24:55.112 --> 24:56.670
But not with her.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.213
Ted's a banker.

25:01.452 --> 25:03.443
He's got class.

25:04.255 --> 25:06.723
Can't you just jump the wall
and pick the lock?

25:07.158 --> 25:09.683
Are you kidding?
That would be unlawful entry.

25:21.338 --> 25:22.498
Excuse me!

25:24.108 --> 25:26.372
I threw away a check
by mistake.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.172
Can I have my trash bag back?

25:28.245 --> 25:30.941
Sorry, property
of Koolau Sanitation now.

25:31.015 --> 25:34.314
Well, look at it this way,
I'll just be saving you
the trouble of dumping it.

25:34.919 --> 25:36.113
Who are you kidding?

25:36.187 --> 25:38.280
Sooner or later,
I'll dump it anyway.

25:38.422 --> 25:41.619
Okay, I'll buy it from you.
Five bucks.

25:43.394 --> 25:44.554
How's about $20?

26:00.311 --> 26:01.300
Ted!

26:03.814 --> 26:04.906
Ted!

26:07.585 --> 26:09.610
Wait, it's me. Ted!

26:09.687 --> 26:11.746
Hey, dude,
where are you going?

26:13.324 --> 26:15.724
Let's go!
Everybody into the van.
Come on.

26:16.860 --> 26:17.849
Come on.

26:20.831 --> 26:22.128
How do you
start this thing?

26:49.226 --> 26:50.215
Hold on!

26:51.195 --> 26:52.184
Whoa!

26:55.899 --> 26:56.957
Is everybody okay?

26:57.034 --> 26:58.126
Yeah.
We're okay.

26:58.202 --> 26:59.726
Yeah,
you all right?

27:00.971 --> 27:02.302
Guess I should've
told you guys

27:02.373 --> 27:05.171
I've been needing
tires for a long time,
you know.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.567
Just take me back
to the college.

27:07.778 --> 27:10.178
I think I can still make
the dropout deadline.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.371
<i>My favorite college</i>
<i>courses were always those</i>

27:20.439 --> 27:22.498
<i>with some sort of lab work.</i>

27:23.409 --> 27:26.378
<i>So there was a real</i>
<i>sense of pride</i>
<i>in finding myself</i>

27:26.445 --> 27:29.676
<i>sitting here conducting</i>
<i>my own lab class.</i>

27:30.249 --> 27:33.275
<i>Dissection of Motel Trash,</i>
<i>Advanced.</i>

27:36.455 --> 27:38.616
<i>Garbage is</i>
<i>to the private investigator</i>

27:38.691 --> 27:41.285
<i>what the single cell</i>
<i>is to the scientist.</i>

27:41.794 --> 27:44.422
<i>A person is</i>
<i>what a person throws away.</i>

27:44.730 --> 27:47.665
<i>In this case, finding</i>
<i>Ted Hazlett's trash</i>

27:47.733 --> 27:49.394
<i>was my only hope for a clue</i>

27:49.468 --> 27:51.436
<i>as to why he didn't</i>
<i>want to be found.</i>

27:51.504 --> 27:54.530
<i>And it was also my only shot</i>
<i>at regaining credibility</i>

27:54.607 --> 27:57.599
<i>with a dwindling</i>
<i>and skeptical class.</i>

28:01.380 --> 28:03.245
Is this really necessary?

28:03.315 --> 28:05.146
Kiana, look what we
already know about the guy

28:05.217 --> 28:06.343
from the trash
he threw out.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.885
We know where he eats,

28:07.953 --> 28:11.081
where he works,
what he drinks and...

28:12.958 --> 28:16.359
Look! Here's a laundry ticket
here with his name on it.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.486
Jackpot.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.032
Deposit receipts
from Huiia Savings and Loan.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.261
Ted doesn't have
that kind of money.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.963
Well, maybe he brought them
home with his work.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.028
No.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.068
It's strictly against policy.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.106
Oh, now wait a minute.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.508
Ted's my fiancé.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.550
We work at the same bank
together.

28:38.617 --> 28:42.109
I mean, I would know
if he were doing
anything illegal.

28:46.192 --> 28:50.128
What in God's name have
you done to Mildred's room?

28:50.396 --> 28:53.024
The trash is part of
a lesson plan, Gaylord.

28:53.098 --> 28:55.089
Don't worry, we'll clean it up
when we're finished.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.567
You are finished, Mr. Magnum.

28:57.636 --> 29:00.969
One of your students had
the good sense to withdraw.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.298
Merle?
No, he missed the deadline.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.674
His account of your
off-campus antics
was so bizarre

29:07.046 --> 29:10.311
that I thought
a change of rules
was in order.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.676
This class is canceled.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.914
Oh, come on, Mr. Gaylord,

29:14.987 --> 29:17.114
you could at least give us
a chance to explain.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.752
Oh, yes, we must continue.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.952
We've just found
our first big clue.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.788
Yeah. Like,
I'm actually motivated.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.325
Please!

29:27.833 --> 29:31.200
You will all receive
the same consideration
given Mr. Merle Bell.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.437
Please come
to the registrar's office

29:33.505 --> 29:35.166
and get your refund.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.215
To tell you the truth,
Higgins,

29:50.289 --> 29:51.313
I'm sorry it's over.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.951
I thought it was
something I could do
without messing up.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.189
I never realized
spreading fertilizer

30:01.267 --> 30:03.633
could bring one
such a sense
of accomplishment.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.770
Don't you think you're taking
your martyrdom a bit too far?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.273
Oh, it isn't martyrdom.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.603
Martyrs become martyrs
for doing things right.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.372
Yes, and you did
everything wrong.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.434
Yes.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.374
And it cost me almost
my entire life's savings
doing it.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.379
Eighty bucks for beer,
20 bucks for garbage,

30:21.453 --> 30:23.648
50 bucks for
Rick and T.C.'s tuition.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.622
All I got out of
the investment

30:25.691 --> 30:29.252
was having to face the fact
that nobody got anything
out of my class.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.730
Well, Stacy Dayton got a very
important piece of information

30:33.799 --> 30:35.130
about her fiancé.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.430
You provided her
with just enough of a clue

30:37.503 --> 30:39.027
to leave her
totally confused

30:39.104 --> 30:40.264
and distraught.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.308
Of course, I understand why
you can't help her
continue her search.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.810
It's imperative that
you sit here in your agony

30:47.079 --> 30:49.013
because you failed
as a teacher.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.317
Please go shower and change.
You're soiling the couch.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.482
All right.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.218
I'll call Stacy and see
if I can help.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.928
What... Wait a minute. Wait.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.393
How did you know
about Stacy's problem?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.430
She told me.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.041
Please, Thomas.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.409
This wasn't just
a classroom exercise to me.

31:20.612 --> 31:24.104
It's the biggest problem
I've ever had in my life.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.650
I mean,

31:25.784 --> 31:29.015
up to now
everything has been easy.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.046
High school and college,

31:32.458 --> 31:33.857
my career.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.390
Even my teeth were straight.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.891
I've had a perfect life

31:42.334 --> 31:43.460
until now.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.128
Ted is in real trouble.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.232
I need your help.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.807
I'll try, Stacy.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.005
I'll try.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.680
But I think
I gotta tell you
that I don't feel

31:58.751 --> 32:01.276
at my investigative best
right now.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.455
Your class disagrees.

32:05.858 --> 32:08.918
We've all signed a petition
to have you reinstated.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.484
And Gaylord bought it?

32:11.830 --> 32:12.956
No.

32:13.565 --> 32:17.023
But all your students
believe in you. Doesn't that
count for something?

32:19.171 --> 32:20.297
Well, yeah.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.670
Stacy, about Ted,
we just don't have
much to go on.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.410
But we do.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.846
These deposit receipts
could be a big lead.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.074
I checked the account number
at the bank.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.085
It belongs to a company called
Central Grocers.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.886
Their deposits
over the last 90 days

32:37.956 --> 32:41.323
have totaled more than
six million in cash.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.825
Of course, grocery concerns
deal mostly
in cash transactions.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.088
Right.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.396
And they get exemptions
from currency
transaction reports.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.397
Why do they get exempted?

32:51.537 --> 32:55.064
Because the bank can give
an exemption
to whomever they please.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.572
And then they charge
a service fee of 5%.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.578
Fifty cents on
every washed $10.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.412
Well, I doubt if you'll still
find the money in your local
accommodating bank.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.915
The funds have probably been
transferred to an account
in a tax-haven country.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.855
I'm quite familiar with this
sort of laundering scheme
from my days with Ml6.

33:13.926 --> 33:15.894
I remember one
most intriguing case...

33:15.961 --> 33:18.623
Do you have the phone number
of this Central Grocers?

33:19.531 --> 33:20.896
Disconnected.

33:20.966 --> 33:24.060
The address they gave
was phony.
There was no D&B listing.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.262
Probably a drug-running
front.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.832
Ted is not involved
in narcotics.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.668
Not narcotics, Stacy,
narco-bucks.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.041
People have a way of
conveniently separating
the two.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.472
Not Ted.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.748
Don't you see?

33:37.816 --> 33:40.080
That's why I know
he must be in trouble.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.017
He must have discovered
what I did,

33:42.087 --> 33:45.352
and he probably knows
who the inside person is
at the bank.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.685
I mean, why else
would he go into hiding?

33:49.528 --> 33:53.089
But how can six million
in cash end up
in a bogus account

33:53.165 --> 33:55.633
without an accountant
or somebody catching it?

33:55.701 --> 33:57.328
Probably by
the most common method,

33:57.402 --> 34:00.462
first perfected by a small,
provincial bank
in northern France.

34:00.839 --> 34:04.138
The deliveries are made
in the most
unobtrusive fashion.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.375
<i>Quite likely</i>
<i>one of those most directly</i>
<i>involved in the scheme</i>

34:08.447 --> 34:09.744
<i>will personally</i>
<i>deliver the money</i>

34:09.815 --> 34:12.215
<i>to the bank official</i>
<i>who's working with them.</i>

34:13.018 --> 34:16.418
<i>The delivery is usually</i>
<i>through a discreet,</i>
<i>private entrance.</i>

34:27.199 --> 34:30.190
Do you recognize
either one of them?
There you go.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.435
Mr. Spencer.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.206
The guy in the suit?
He works at the bank?

34:42.014 --> 34:44.277
He's the vice-president.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.456
Won't he know
you're following him?

34:56.562 --> 34:59.087
Stacy, I do this
all the time, remember?

35:00.132 --> 35:01.463
Sorry.

35:06.071 --> 35:08.904
He'll probably
change clothes and take off.

35:09.741 --> 35:13.404
After he leaves, we'll go in
and check his files.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.335
Clever.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.853
Very clever.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.403
That must be Grider.

36:02.227 --> 36:05.754
I thought
you told the class
that that was unlawful entry.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.422
Right.
It is at certain times.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.858
What certain times?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.234
When class is in session.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.594
Freeze.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.770
United States
Treasury Department.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.476
This ID doesn't
give you the license
to break and enter.

37:01.786 --> 37:02.775
Or kill people.

37:03.053 --> 37:05.044
He was like that
when we found him.

37:05.122 --> 37:07.454
And yours doesn't
give you the right
to crack ribs either.

37:07.525 --> 37:09.686
You should have told us
who you were at that bar.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.954
Did I get a chance?

37:11.295 --> 37:12.421
More than he got.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.290
You saw us come in.
You should have seen that car
that pulled away.

37:16.367 --> 37:17.834
We thought it was Grider.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.430
What were you doing here?

37:20.504 --> 37:22.062
We're trying to find Ted Hazlett.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.137
Now, where is he
and what's he mixed up in?

37:26.377 --> 37:27.810
I don't know.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.079
He gave the IRS a tip.

37:30.214 --> 37:32.774
Before we could get
the full story,
he disappeared on us.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.615
Must have got scared.

37:35.786 --> 37:38.118
If you've got any idea
where he is,
you better tell us now,

37:38.189 --> 37:39.520
before anybody else gets hurt.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.319
We wish we did know.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.317
What tip?

37:43.394 --> 37:44.861
The money laundering scheme.

37:46.197 --> 37:49.166
We've had Grider
under surveillance
for about a week.

37:50.234 --> 37:53.226
Looks like his clients
got nervous about
being discovered

37:53.304 --> 37:55.499
and decided to
terminate the arrangement.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.972
Yeah, well, we're sorry
we got in your way. Can we go?

38:01.412 --> 38:03.243
Wait. What about Ted?
Stacy,

38:03.314 --> 38:04.804
they said they don't know
where he is.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.112
I'm sure he'll get back
in touch with us
in a couple of days,

38:07.184 --> 38:09.345
like they said.
Now, may I have
my ID please?

38:12.723 --> 38:13.712
Oh.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.324
I'm sorry.

38:18.362 --> 38:19.886
It's been one of those weeks.

38:21.131 --> 38:22.120
Yeah.

38:24.768 --> 38:25.894
For us, too.

38:28.405 --> 38:30.498
It fits a safe deposit box,
right?

38:30.574 --> 38:33.168
And I thought you were
just being a klutz back there.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.178
You're right.
It's for a box
at Huiia Savings.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.248
You know,
Blaylock might have had
Grider killed

38:39.316 --> 38:41.580
if he thought
he had something on him.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.146
Something incriminating.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.414
What?

38:44.522 --> 38:46.490
I thought they were
the good guys.

38:46.590 --> 38:50.549
Stacy, treasury agents
don't use strong-arm tactics
in bars.

38:50.628 --> 38:53.654
Not honest ones anyway.
Excuse me.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.392
Do you mean
they killed Grider?

38:55.466 --> 38:57.331
Well, they must have been
in on it.

38:57.401 --> 39:00.928
I mean, how could they
possibly have missed that car
pulling away from the office?

39:01.939 --> 39:04.100
And if they actually
are agents,

39:04.174 --> 39:05.937
then they will have
no trouble at all

39:06.010 --> 39:08.376
framing Ted
and getting off clean.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.174
Unless there is something
incriminating in that box.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.309
Stacy,

39:18.222 --> 39:21.020
I don't think they're gonna
wanna face the problem
of framing him.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.583
They'd rather just find him
and make sure
he doesn't talk.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.093
Thomas, we've got to find Ted
before they do.

39:28.465 --> 39:29.762
To do that,
we've gotta find out

39:29.833 --> 39:31.801
what's in Grider's box
tomorrow.

39:32.202 --> 39:35.228
And then we'll have
a little class field trip.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.171
But there is no class anymore.

39:40.945 --> 39:42.310
Whoa, bummer.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.008
Excuse me.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.521
It's all right.
Go ahead with your work,
Miss Dayton.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.114
I'll take care
of this young man.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.393
Yes, sir. You'd like to
get into your safety deposit.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.828
Well, yeah.
Well, I don't know.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.158
Yeah, I guess.

40:03.367 --> 40:04.857
You do have a box here?

40:04.935 --> 40:06.994
Well, sure. It's just that...

40:09.173 --> 40:12.336
Whoa, bummer.
I brought my AT&T stock.

40:12.409 --> 40:15.173
It was my Standard Oil
I wanted to stash
in the freezer.

40:15.245 --> 40:17.805
See ya.
Any time we can
be of service.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.936
Wow, like I hope I never
have to find my way
to Tacoma again.

40:52.349 --> 40:55.284
Would you like to put
something in your
safety deposit box, sir?

40:55.352 --> 40:56.341
Yeah.

40:57.554 --> 40:59.249
Sign this slip, please.

41:19.276 --> 41:21.176
Thank you very much,
Mr. Grider.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.340
Now, please follow me.

41:23.847 --> 41:25.974
And what exactly was
in the box, Magnum?

41:26.050 --> 41:30.316
Oh, names, dates,
tapes of meetings,
lists of corporate officers.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.787
<i>Some of the people involved</i>
<i>are real shockers.</i>

41:32.856 --> 41:34.756
So what do you want
out of this, Magnum?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.816
Oh, a finder's fee.

41:36.894 --> 41:40.853
Nothing exorbitant.
Say, 10%% of whatever's
recovered.

41:40.964 --> 41:43.524
Say 1%%,
and you're saying a fortune.

41:43.734 --> 41:45.725
So I'm willing to negotiate.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.863
Provided I'm guaranteed
complete immunity.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.703
The Treasury Department
will want to see
what you've got first.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.005
Okay. 4:00,
King Kamehameha Club.

41:54.078 --> 41:55.272
I'm not a member.

41:55.345 --> 41:56.539
Neither am I.

41:59.616 --> 42:01.140
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

42:01.218 --> 42:03.448
<i>Forcing the issue</i>
<i>with Blaylock</i>

42:03.554 --> 42:06.421
<i>was kind of like</i>
<i>cramming for finals</i>
<i>the night before.</i>

42:07.024 --> 42:09.117
<i>But you can't be</i>
<i>a student forever.</i>

42:09.293 --> 42:12.091
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>you have to graduate.</i>

42:12.763 --> 42:13.752
You're early.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.725
So are you.

42:15.799 --> 42:17.096
Where's the stuff?

42:17.868 --> 42:19.028
Oh, right here.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.339
Let's talk about it
over a drink.

42:26.143 --> 42:27.132
Hey.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.648
I'm not thirsty.
Just hand it over.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.418
Maps.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.753
Hey, Mr. C,
we got road maps out here.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.054
You're real funny,
huh?
Let's go, joker.

42:48.132 --> 42:49.793
Careful of my ribs.
Come on.

42:50.300 --> 42:52.461
Hi. You guys wanna
have a good time?

42:52.536 --> 42:53.468
No, lady.
Come on.

42:53.537 --> 42:55.596
Flowers for the lady.
Beautiful, fresh...
No, thanks.

42:55.672 --> 42:57.936
Will you ladies buzz off,
please?

42:58.008 --> 42:59.498
...is very nice.

43:00.410 --> 43:03.379
Hey, what's going on?
Is somebody gonna
move that thing?

43:04.648 --> 43:05.808
Move it!

43:07.117 --> 43:08.982
You're in a handicapped space.

43:09.386 --> 43:10.876
Just leave your keys
in the car.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.147
Hey!
Hey, come on.
Hey, baby. Hey.

43:13.590 --> 43:15.558
Look, nobody parks the car,
okay?

43:15.626 --> 43:17.890
Hey, valet parking only
after 2:00.

43:17.961 --> 43:19.588
Hey, I'm the manager here.
What's the problem?

43:19.830 --> 43:21.695
This guy wants to park
his own car.

43:21.765 --> 43:22.959
Nobody self parks.

43:23.033 --> 43:24.500
Now, how many people
are in your party?

43:24.902 --> 43:27.029
Now, look,
there isn't any party.

43:37.781 --> 43:38.770
Hold it!

43:56.400 --> 43:57.389
Perfect.

43:59.236 --> 44:02.501
Welcome back to class,

44:05.843 --> 44:08.175
old students and new ones.

44:08.712 --> 44:11.738
You'll be happy to hear that
I talked to Dave Gibson
this morning,

44:11.815 --> 44:13.749
and you'll all soon
be able to register

44:13.817 --> 44:16.479
for Advanced
Private Investigation 201.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.310
All right.

44:21.458 --> 44:24.222
Amazing what
a little publicity
will do for you.

44:24.294 --> 44:25.761
Yeah, right.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.387
Oh, and I'm also
sorry to announce

44:27.464 --> 44:29.329
that we're gonna be
losing the Hazletts.

44:29.399 --> 44:31.560
They're off
on a European honeymoon.

44:31.635 --> 44:33.899
Aw!

44:33.971 --> 44:35.939
Thanks to Ted's reward money.

44:37.140 --> 44:39.836
Some of that reward money
belongs to you.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.380
I hope it's close
to your usual fee.

44:46.216 --> 44:48.241
At least it's expenses.

44:54.958 --> 44:57.825
Thank you.
Thank you. I'm very touched.

44:59.763 --> 45:03.494
And now, I think
we should touch
a couple of bases

45:03.567 --> 45:05.967
in order to wrap up that case,

45:06.069 --> 45:08.731
so we can get on to
Merle's pick-up truck
con artist.

45:09.773 --> 45:13.504
Ted, why don't you tell us
why you went into hiding
in the first place.

45:14.278 --> 45:15.302
All right.

45:15.913 --> 45:19.542
Well, when I realized
something fishy was going on,

45:19.616 --> 45:21.345
I called the Treasury
Department right away.

45:21.952 --> 45:24.546
I mean, I didn't know who
at the bank was involved.

45:24.621 --> 45:26.612
I talked to agent Blaylock,

45:26.690 --> 45:28.954
and he said he'd be right over
to get a statement.

45:29.026 --> 45:30.425
But when I called back

45:30.494 --> 45:33.429
to suggest that perhaps
we meet someplace else
besides the bank,

45:33.497 --> 45:35.488
nobody there
seemed to know
who I was

45:35.565 --> 45:37.294
or what I was talking about.

45:38.168 --> 45:43.003
Well, then I got scared
that maybe Agent Blaylock
was a Treasury man gone bad.

45:43.573 --> 45:46.667
But, of course, Blaylock
was not the brains
behind the operation.

45:46.743 --> 45:49.906
No. The head guy
was a weasely guy

45:50.213 --> 45:52.078
by the name of Mr. C.

45:52.482 --> 45:55.747
Something someone found out
from a guy named Ice Pick.

45:56.119 --> 45:59.384
And when you
couldn't find anything
in the deposit box

45:59.456 --> 46:00.946
to incriminate Blaylock,

46:01.024 --> 46:02.685
you decided to bluff him.

46:03.226 --> 46:06.286
And so you begged
one of your class members
to get on the phone

46:06.363 --> 46:08.729
and arrange plan B,

46:08.799 --> 46:10.266
the class field trip
to the club.

46:10.334 --> 46:13.667
Now, this certain class member
was certainly glad to help,

46:13.737 --> 46:16.604
even though he missed
a big fare to Maui.

46:16.707 --> 46:20.803
And, of course,
Shipley was just a thug
who worked for Mr. C.

46:21.144 --> 46:24.079
And since this guy, Ice Pick,
knew most of his associates,

46:24.147 --> 46:27.048
it was easy for him
to trace down
the actual hitman

46:27.117 --> 46:28.141
who took care
of Grider.

46:28.218 --> 46:33.087
And, when the license plate
on Grider's van
traced back to Mr. C,

46:33.156 --> 46:35.818
you had the evidence
to incriminate him.

46:36.026 --> 46:38.654
So a quick phone call
to get him to worry

46:38.729 --> 46:40.594
got him to the club also.

46:41.031 --> 46:43.556
Your usual source
for this license information

46:43.633 --> 46:46.363
was busy with this man
called Ice Pick.

46:50.374 --> 46:51.864
Thanks, guys.

46:53.710 --> 46:54.699
Any questions?

46:55.846 --> 46:57.006
I got one or two.

46:57.114 --> 47:00.083
Why didn't Blaylock or Shipley
take care of you and Stacy

47:00.150 --> 47:01.174
at Grider's office?

47:01.251 --> 47:04.584
Yeah. And, Ted, why did you
throw away the receipts
at the motel?

47:04.654 --> 47:07.122
I wanna know why you
didn't confront Spencer
at the bank

47:07.190 --> 47:08.248
instead of following Grider?

47:08.325 --> 47:10.759
Yeah, and...
And come to think of it,

47:10.827 --> 47:13.057
how come you just didn't
give the cops the photos

47:13.130 --> 47:13.994
and be done with this?

47:14.064 --> 47:15.292
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

47:15.365 --> 47:18.061
Who was Grider?
- And why did they kill him?

47:18.135 --> 47:21.127
Yeah, like, I was wondering
about the license plate
on the van.

47:21.204 --> 47:24.230
That Mr. C was pretty stupid
to use his
real license plates.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.766
You're not answering
the questions, Mr. Magnum.

47:26.843 --> 47:29.243
Hey, where'd you come up
with the idea about
the garbage bag idea?

47:29.312 --> 47:30.836
I mean, I've never heard
about anything like that.
