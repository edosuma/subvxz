02:13.004 --> 02:16.607
Rise and shine,
morning glories.

02:16.674 --> 02:19.042
First day of production.

02:19.110 --> 02:20.944
Wake up!

02:22.714 --> 02:25.049
Wake up. Baby bro starts shooting today.

02:25.116 --> 02:26.650
We all need to be up
to support him.

02:26.718 --> 02:28.218
Hell, I'm up!

02:28.286 --> 02:30.454
- whoa!
- you are now, son.

02:30.522 --> 02:33.323
Let's go, manager.

02:33.391 --> 02:35.626
Your number-one client
starts shooting today.

02:35.693 --> 02:37.995
- I don't think you want to miss it.
- jesus.

02:38.063 --> 02:39.630
Baby bro.
Baby bro.

02:39.664 --> 02:41.899
Yeah, johnny.

02:41.966 --> 02:43.901
How'd you get down here?

02:44.002 --> 02:45.869
I've been up for hours.
You blew right past me.

02:45.970 --> 02:47.571
- really?
- yup.

02:47.639 --> 02:50.574
- ready for work today?
- getting there.

02:50.642 --> 02:53.077
You want me to make you
anything special for breakfast?

02:53.111 --> 02:54.611
No, I'm okay.
I'm not really hungry.

02:54.679 --> 02:56.980
Not hungry?

03:04.656 --> 03:07.057
Hopefully it's just
first day jitters, bro.

03:07.125 --> 03:08.992
Leave him alone, drama.
He's fine.

03:09.027 --> 03:11.762
He barely slept last night,
now he doesn't want to eat.

03:11.863 --> 03:13.997
He's not fine.

03:14.065 --> 03:17.000
- here, drink a powerade, bro.
- no thanks.

03:17.068 --> 03:19.737
- get your electrolytes up.
- no thank you.

03:19.771 --> 03:22.973
This is not the best way to start
the most important job of your career.

03:23.007 --> 03:25.275
- you trying to freak him out?
- no, I'm trying to calm him.

03:25.376 --> 03:27.111
Yeah, well, you're not.
You're making us all crazy.

03:27.212 --> 03:29.947
Nah, he's not getting crazy.
Vince ain't like us, e.

03:30.014 --> 03:31.415
He's cool as ice, right?

03:31.483 --> 03:33.183
Actually,
I am a bit nervous.

03:33.251 --> 03:36.353
- god damn it, I knew it.
- will you shut up, drama, please?

03:36.421 --> 03:38.856
- you shut up.
- what's the problem, vin?

03:38.923 --> 03:40.657
I don't know.
I just feel a bit off.

03:40.725 --> 03:42.326
I haven't been on a set
in over a year.

03:42.394 --> 03:44.595
Eric: it's like riding a
bike. You just do what you do.

03:44.662 --> 03:46.997
Verner hasn't even had a second
to talk to me about my character.

03:47.065 --> 03:48.565
Can you even  understand
that guy?

03:48.633 --> 03:50.834
Sounds like a cat
with a german hairball.

03:50.902 --> 03:52.403
The guy's won two
foreign academy awards.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.204
He's a good director.
Really good.

03:54.272 --> 03:56.407
- so this is all good?
- it's all good.

03:56.474 --> 03:59.143
- what's your first scene?
- entering the brush with jason patric.

03:59.210 --> 04:01.612
Nice.
I like jason patric.

04:01.679 --> 04:04.481
You know, when he was doing "rush" he
stuck real needles in his arm to prep.

04:04.549 --> 04:06.450
That's what inspired
me to do real coke

04:06.551 --> 04:08.185
When I did the menendez
brothers movie.

04:08.219 --> 04:09.920
Weren't you
an extra on that?

04:09.988 --> 04:12.189
So? Still kept it real like j. P. Does.

04:12.257 --> 04:14.725
- okay, now you're freaking
me out, johnnre- sorry, bro.

04:14.793 --> 04:16.560
Don't worry about it, vince.
It's gonna be like all

04:16.628 --> 04:18.796
The other movies you've done.
Only a little bit bigger.

04:18.863 --> 04:20.964
Verner:
11 and 15, fire.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.736
Six, seven, fire.

04:25.804 --> 04:28.772
- 22, 24.
- holy shit.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.008
Fire 45 to 60.

04:31.076 --> 04:33.210
Fire.

04:33.278 --> 04:36.280
- okay, number 60, fire.
- eric: jesus.

04:36.347 --> 04:39.750
Camera three and two,
closer closer.

04:39.818 --> 04:42.986
Okay, all choppers,
now follow me.

04:44.189 --> 04:46.890
This is gonna be sick.

04:50.862 --> 04:52.596
And word from the forest?

04:52.630 --> 04:54.665
Vince got his start gift
and he says thank you.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.366
Great.
What did I get him?

04:56.434 --> 04:58.802
A sea salt scrub
from bliss spa.

04:58.837 --> 05:01.772
- are you kidding me?
- yes, of course I am.

05:01.806 --> 05:03.707
You got him a jet ski
for the lake out there.

05:03.775 --> 05:05.676
Great.
I have amazing taste.

05:05.810 --> 05:08.479
Good work, lloyd. What's
my fortune cookie tell me?

05:08.546 --> 05:11.415
That's you've got lunch with
andrew klein and that you cannot...

05:11.483 --> 05:13.517
- both: cancel it.
- you cannot cancel it.

05:13.585 --> 05:15.119
I'm the boss.
I can do whatever I want.

05:15.186 --> 05:17.187
Ari, you've canceled on
him six times already.

05:17.222 --> 05:20.057
- you can't cancel again.
- I don't want to sit at lunch with him.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.992
- it makes me sad.
- why?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.627
Because it reminds me
of what I might've become.

05:23.695 --> 05:27.064
- a tv lit agent in encino.
- you did not become that, ari.

05:27.132 --> 05:28.732
So sit at lunch with him
and feel good about that.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.301
You sit at lunch with him
knowing you could be him

05:31.336 --> 05:33.370
One day if you
don't listen to me.

05:33.438 --> 05:36.440
- when do I not listen to you?
- right now when I'm telling you to cancel it.

05:36.508 --> 05:38.642
<i>Andrew klein was once your
close friend and mentor.</i>

05:38.710 --> 05:42.146
Now go reminisce and enjoy
yourself because I'm not canceling.

05:42.213 --> 05:45.149
Maybe put on
a cheaper watch though

05:45.216 --> 05:46.517
So he doesn't
feel too bad.

05:50.355 --> 05:53.157
Run down to geary's
and get me a stainless rolex.

05:56.594 --> 05:58.429
I know what's in
there waiting for me.

05:58.463 --> 06:00.898
And nine other brave souls
knew what was waiting for them.

06:00.932 --> 06:03.367
There's no way
I cannot go now.

06:03.435 --> 06:06.203
Maybe try it with a little
more emotion, bro.

06:06.237 --> 06:09.406
I'm just memorizing,
johnny, thanks.

06:09.474 --> 06:11.442
Saving it up for in front
of the cameras, right, vin?

06:11.509 --> 06:13.710
<i>- yup.
- just checking.</i>

06:13.778 --> 06:15.512
We're ready
for you, mr. Chase.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.616
- okay.
- show time.

06:23.955 --> 06:25.723
You know, you did mess up
that one line, though.

06:25.790 --> 06:27.624
- I did?
- yeah.

06:27.692 --> 06:29.560
You said nine other
brave souls

06:29.627 --> 06:31.228
As opposed to the eight
other brave souls.

06:31.296 --> 06:33.397
Oh, right.
Obviously.

06:33.465 --> 06:35.532
Jesus, when do I
mess up lines?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.135
Just write the number eight
down on the inside of your palm.

06:38.203 --> 06:39.403
This way you can
just sneak a peek.

06:39.471 --> 06:40.804
I do that shit
all the time.

06:40.872 --> 06:42.940
Or, who was number eight
on the basketball team?

06:43.007 --> 06:45.242
- you were, turtle.
- thank of that.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.010
Good tip.

06:47.078 --> 06:49.613
- vincent.
- hey, verner.

06:49.714 --> 06:52.049
I thought you were
shortening your hair.

06:52.117 --> 06:54.918
- I wasn't told.
- it's fine.

06:54.986 --> 06:57.521
Doesn't matter.
You ready to go?

06:57.589 --> 06:59.957
Yeah, I'd love
a minute to discuss

07:00.024 --> 07:01.658
What you want me to do
with this character.

07:01.726 --> 07:03.460
There's nothing to discuss.
We shoot it.

07:03.528 --> 07:05.396
And if I don't like it
I will tell you.

07:05.463 --> 07:06.764
But I'm sure I will like it. Okay?

07:06.831 --> 07:09.533
- okay.
- jason!

07:11.736 --> 07:13.871
Verner, is this pack
regulation or what?

07:13.938 --> 07:15.539
- yes, it is.
- feels light to me.

07:15.607 --> 07:18.976
No, it is the correct
weight, jason.

07:19.043 --> 07:20.978
Do you know vincent chase?

07:21.045 --> 07:23.947
- not personally. I'm a big fan.
- yeah, me too.

07:24.015 --> 07:26.283
What do you weigh, vin?

07:26.351 --> 07:28.919
Uh, 170.

07:28.987 --> 07:31.822
You know, they offered
me that "aquaman 2."

07:31.890 --> 07:33.624
Really?

07:33.691 --> 07:35.426
Not really.

07:35.493 --> 07:38.462
Sequels, water
- come on, my friend. It's not for me.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.731
Well, me either,
I guess.

07:40.799 --> 07:43.700
That's funny.

07:43.768 --> 07:46.303
- okay, let's shoot.
- aren't we gonna rehearse first?

07:46.371 --> 07:48.539
No, we shoot
the rehearsal.

07:48.606 --> 07:50.174
Love that!

07:50.241 --> 07:51.642
- break a leg, bro.
- knock 'em dead, vince.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.343
<i>Verner:
cue the fire!</i>

08:01.720 --> 08:03.387
The fire's coming
from the west.

08:03.455 --> 08:05.355
The west winds are blowing
out of control.

08:05.423 --> 08:06.957
We'll have to bring
in more men, sir.

08:07.025 --> 08:09.093
There are no more men
to bring in.

08:11.730 --> 08:14.198
You know what's waiting
in there for you.

08:14.232 --> 08:17.000
And eight other brave souls
knew what was waiting for them.

08:17.068 --> 08:19.203
<i>There's no way
you can't go now.</i>

08:19.270 --> 08:21.505
- that's vince's line.
- cut!

08:21.573 --> 08:23.707
Perfect, let's move on.

08:23.775 --> 08:26.076
<i>- one take?
- verner: yes!</i>

08:26.144 --> 08:27.811
Love that!

08:40.924 --> 08:42.893
Ari.

08:42.927 --> 08:44.862
- andrew.
- hey.

08:44.929 --> 08:47.030
Andrew.
There he is.

08:47.098 --> 08:49.133
Come here.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.568
- how are you, andrew?
- pretty good. Pretty good.

08:51.636 --> 08:53.604
God, you look great.

08:53.671 --> 08:55.105
Thank you.
Try to keep healthy.

08:55.173 --> 08:57.708
- yeah. Yeah, sure.
- you know.

08:59.077 --> 09:01.044
- should we sit?
- oh, yeah, sorry.

09:01.079 --> 09:03.547
These fuckers. They're not
honoring my reservation.

09:03.615 --> 09:06.050
So they're saying a table is
gonna take about 30 minutes.

09:06.117 --> 09:08.285
So I thought we'd just eat
at the bar, if that's okay.

09:08.353 --> 09:09.987
Bar is great.

09:10.055 --> 09:13.891
Barkeep, can I have another
mccallum 18 neat for my buddy here?

09:13.958 --> 09:15.526
You're still drinking
scotch, I assume?

09:15.593 --> 09:17.561
Not usually for lunch.

09:17.629 --> 09:19.563
But it's a special
occasion.

09:19.631 --> 09:21.765
Come on.
It's been a long time.

09:24.069 --> 09:27.337
I remember the last time
I had a drink with you

09:27.405 --> 09:30.841
I ended up covering
your boss' phones

09:30.909 --> 09:33.243
While you fucked
that cocktail waitress

09:33.278 --> 09:35.512
You snuck into the mailroom.
Remember that?

09:35.547 --> 09:38.048
I could not believe the sounds
coming out of that room.

09:38.116 --> 09:41.085
Well, you know what?
She did a nice job.

09:41.152 --> 09:43.087
- did she?
- yeah.

09:43.154 --> 09:44.822
I'm so happy for you,
believe me.

09:44.889 --> 09:47.091
You almost got me fired.
You remember that?

09:47.158 --> 09:50.127
You accidentally dropped that
conference call with john ritter.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.029
- no, it was john goodman.
- was it?

09:52.063 --> 09:53.297
Yeah, and I didn't
feel badly at all.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.299
I figured maybe I was
doing you a favor.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.034
I love it.
Come here, you dick.

09:58.903 --> 10:01.472
- oh, man.
- we had some good times.

10:01.539 --> 10:02.973
Too many.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.209
We should not let too much
time pass this time.

10:06.511 --> 10:08.245
No, for sure we shouldn't.

10:09.814 --> 10:10.981
What's wrong?
You all right?

10:11.049 --> 10:13.117
Yeah, it's just...

10:13.151 --> 10:16.620
This wasn't just
a friendly call.

10:18.022 --> 10:19.723
Oh no?

10:23.695 --> 10:25.763
- how was lunch?
- pricey.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.799
- in encino?
- he needs a loan, lloyd.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.334
- oy.
- half a mil.

10:30.435 --> 10:32.836
Double oy. Well, you don't
have to give it to him.

10:32.904 --> 10:35.272
Yes I do. Andy and I were once brothers.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.041
A twist of fate turned
one of us into gold

10:38.109 --> 10:39.676
And one of us into,
well, a broke,

10:39.744 --> 10:42.713
Desperate, begging-
for-money cocksucker.

10:42.781 --> 10:44.548
what are those?

10:44.616 --> 10:46.316
His books.
Company books.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.385
He gave them to me to prove
that he could pay me back.

10:48.453 --> 10:50.854
What am I doing? You're asian, you're
supposed to be good with numbers.

10:50.922 --> 10:53.791
Figure out if he has any shot
of paying me back.

10:53.858 --> 10:56.527
Because if he doesn't,
you will!

11:01.366 --> 11:03.133
- eric: maybe it was a mistake.
- vince: maybe.

11:03.201 --> 11:04.701
Seems like
an odd mistake.

11:04.803 --> 11:06.470
The guy does a movie
every five years.

11:06.538 --> 11:09.006
Maybe he's trying to make up
for it by saying extra words.

11:09.074 --> 11:11.308
- you got to talk to him.
- what am I gonna say?

11:11.376 --> 11:14.678
Say, "hey, jason, you got a literacy
problem or did you just steal my lines?"

11:14.746 --> 11:17.614
- what if he says I did?
- we may have to get tough with him.

11:17.682 --> 11:21.618
I hear he's like
a fifth-degree black belt.

11:21.686 --> 11:24.188
I'll get tough. I'm just
saying the guy's intense.

11:24.255 --> 11:26.757
All right, relax. No one's getting
tough. I'm sure it was an accident.

11:26.825 --> 11:28.158
Yeah, a bad accident.

11:28.226 --> 11:30.060
I mean, it was a major
moment for my character

11:30.161 --> 11:32.396
To say I'm man enoughto go into.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.031
And now I basically
bail on it.

11:34.099 --> 11:35.699
Why didn't the director
say anything?

11:35.767 --> 11:37.101
Why didn't anybody
say anything?

11:37.168 --> 11:38.902
The script supervisor?
Nobody.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.238
'cause it's jason patric
and everyone's scared of him.

11:41.306 --> 11:43.440
But turtle's right. You
got to nip this in the bud.

11:43.508 --> 11:45.909
That's how a star
marks his territory.

11:45.977 --> 11:48.378
Andrew shue did the same
thing to me on "melrose. "

11:48.446 --> 11:51.115
- how'd you stop him?
- I banged his girl.

11:51.182 --> 11:53.684
- what did that do?
- I don't know, but she was booming.

11:55.353 --> 11:57.187
I'm gonna go talk to him.

11:57.255 --> 11:58.288
- right behind you.
- alone.

11:58.356 --> 11:59.957
All right, vin.
Go get him.

12:00.024 --> 12:02.526
Hey, remind him he got
molested in "sleepers. "

12:02.594 --> 12:04.328
That'll throw him
off balance.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.567
what?

12:10.635 --> 12:12.503
Yeah, jason, it's vince.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.106
Come in.

12:21.246 --> 12:22.813
- hey, vince.
- hey.

12:22.881 --> 12:25.249
- everything okay?
- yeah.

12:25.316 --> 12:27.584
I just wanted to talk
about the scene.

12:27.652 --> 12:30.954
Thank you.
I feel good about it.

12:31.022 --> 12:32.489
How do you feel you did?

12:32.557 --> 12:34.458
I felt good.
I just-

12:34.526 --> 12:36.894
Good. I thought you
were pretty good too.

12:36.961 --> 12:38.562
- thank you.
- I did.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.297
- so I-
- you want a protein shake?

12:40.365 --> 12:41.832
- no, I'm- - you should
have a protein shake.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.234
Juice, get him a shake.
Just give him the pads.

12:47.138 --> 12:49.573
- so it's about the-
- put 'em on.

12:49.641 --> 12:52.543
I just wanted to talk
to you about the lines.

12:52.610 --> 12:54.144
- yeah, good ones, aren't they?
- yeah.

12:54.212 --> 12:55.746
A lot of 'em.
Come on.

13:02.721 --> 13:06.056
So if we-
it's really hot in here.

13:06.124 --> 13:07.658
Isn't it?

13:07.726 --> 13:10.127
You know how hot it can get
when wood combusts, don't you?

13:10.195 --> 13:12.229
3000°.

13:12.297 --> 13:13.263
Hot.

13:15.133 --> 13:18.001
I like to jack up the heat, acclimate
my body a little bit, you know?

13:18.069 --> 13:20.037
I'm good.

13:20.105 --> 13:21.538
Okay, um, so-

13:21.606 --> 13:23.574
Some life we're living,
isn't it, vince?

13:25.844 --> 13:27.311
Some life.

13:27.345 --> 13:29.613
I'm gonna do
some crunches.

13:29.681 --> 13:31.482
Okay.

13:37.288 --> 13:39.656
You pussed out.

13:39.724 --> 13:41.291
Yup.

13:44.529 --> 13:46.897
Take longer, lloyd.
Seriously.

13:46.965 --> 13:49.466
- I'm almost finished.
- how big of a loser is he?

13:49.534 --> 13:51.268
Andrew klein
is no loser, ari.

13:51.336 --> 13:53.437
- andrew klein is a big winner.
- how so?

13:53.505 --> 13:57.074
It looks like he just has a little cash
flow problem brought on by the strike.

13:57.142 --> 13:59.443
- he quietly has
a very nice business. Ly h?

13:59.511 --> 14:01.145
Unless these books
are cooked,

14:01.212 --> 14:03.213
I think he pays you back
in full in 90 days.

14:03.281 --> 14:04.615
Wow.

14:04.682 --> 14:07.684
Did you know that he has over
50 writers staffed on tv shows?

14:07.752 --> 14:09.953
- that's unbelievable.
- he's an anonymous star,

14:09.988 --> 14:12.289
Wrongly judged by
the location of his office.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.024
Jesus, he made some money
last year, huh?

14:14.092 --> 14:15.726
And paid some out.
Look what his assistant made.

14:15.794 --> 14:17.895
- you want to work in the valley, lloyd?
- mmm.

14:19.497 --> 14:21.965
You know, andrew klein was
me when we were younger.

14:23.401 --> 14:26.437
We were the same.
Rising stars.

14:26.471 --> 14:29.173
Both made lots of money.
Both got tons of pussy.

14:29.207 --> 14:31.775
- what happened?
- we both married too young.

14:31.843 --> 14:33.544
I meant with work.

14:33.578 --> 14:35.512
When terrance
and jim oliver split,

14:35.580 --> 14:37.281
They ended up dividing
up the agency.

14:37.348 --> 14:39.717
I went with terrance,
andrew went with jim.

14:39.784 --> 14:42.119
Jim ended up ripping off
all of his clients

14:42.187 --> 14:45.289
And his employees.
And andrew...

14:45.356 --> 14:48.425
Never made it back
to the big time again.

14:48.493 --> 14:50.327
That's sad.

14:52.464 --> 14:54.264
Get him on the phone.
I want to have drinks tonight.

14:54.332 --> 14:55.799
You're gonna give him
the loan, ari?

14:55.867 --> 14:57.668
I'm gonna do a lot more
than that, lloyd.

14:57.736 --> 14:59.603
I'm gonna give
him a life.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.505
Maybe someday you'll
give me one too.

15:03.441 --> 15:05.209
<i>Ari gold calling
for andrew klein.</i>

15:07.879 --> 15:09.980
Verner.

15:10.048 --> 15:12.116
This?

15:12.183 --> 15:13.684
Okay, no problem.

15:15.553 --> 15:18.355
All right, I used to have
a chair with my name on it.

15:19.624 --> 15:21.558
Oh, jason, take mine.
Take mine.

15:21.626 --> 15:24.661
Juice, go get my chair.

15:24.729 --> 15:26.530
- where?
- just find it.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.568
What are you
smiling about?

15:34.406 --> 15:37.107
- jesus.
- I love it.

15:37.175 --> 15:39.543
<i>Verner: I want everybody
on this set to be aware</i>

15:39.611 --> 15:42.780
That mr. Jason patric's
seat back is missing.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.816
I know you probably think that
this will be a good souvenir

15:45.884 --> 15:47.618
To show
your children someday,

15:47.685 --> 15:50.554
But to me it's a severe
breach of trust.

15:50.588 --> 15:53.857
I want you to return it immediately
and everything will be forgotten.

15:53.925 --> 15:56.593
If not and you're found
out later,

15:56.661 --> 15:58.929
You will be
treated as harshly

15:58.997 --> 16:00.931
As humanly possible.

16:04.602 --> 16:07.371
- should I give it back?
- no way.

16:07.439 --> 16:09.373
He just said if you give
it back now he's not gonna-

16:09.441 --> 16:11.809
He's german,
don't trust him.

16:11.876 --> 16:13.143
E?

16:13.178 --> 16:15.045
Hide it
in jason's trailer.

16:15.146 --> 16:17.481
- hey, how's it going?
- everything's good with us.

16:17.549 --> 16:19.416
<i>- eric: you good?
- yeah, I'm feeling good.</i>

16:19.484 --> 16:21.485
<i>Verner: okay, people. Let's shoot.</i>

16:21.553 --> 16:24.088
Vince, you drink the shake?

16:24.155 --> 16:25.989
- uh, yeah, I-
- fish oil in there.

16:26.057 --> 16:29.093
Focus. You ready
to make history?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.328
- absolutely.
- let's do it.

16:32.630 --> 16:34.131
Come on.

16:36.034 --> 16:38.135
<i>Man:
got to push the defensive line!</i>

16:48.646 --> 16:50.748
sir.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.516
Sir, malone is down

16:52.584 --> 16:54.718
I can't do it.

16:54.786 --> 16:56.286
I keep thinking
about janine.

16:56.354 --> 16:57.955
What kind of father
would I be?

16:58.022 --> 16:59.757
<i>Jason:
you'll be fine.</i>

16:59.824 --> 17:02.359
We're going in together
and I will have your back.

17:02.427 --> 17:04.661
<i>- vince: I'm sorry, can we take it back?
- jason: what?</i>

17:04.729 --> 17:06.964
- that's vince's line again.
- this guy's a klepto.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.031
- don't cut.
- I'm really sorry.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.902
It threw me a little when you
said the "you'll be fine" line.

17:11.970 --> 17:13.670
- I thought it was me.
- keep rolling, keep rolling.

17:13.738 --> 17:17.040
- just go back.
- okay, from "what kind of father?"

17:17.108 --> 17:19.175
<i>Verner:
action!</i>

17:19.243 --> 17:22.012
What kind of father
would I be?

17:22.079 --> 17:23.914
<i>- you'll-
- you'll be fine.</i>

17:23.982 --> 17:26.450
<i>We're going in together
and I will have your back.</i>

17:26.518 --> 17:28.819
- this is nuts.
- shue all over again.

17:28.887 --> 17:31.088
And cut.
Thank you, great.

17:31.189 --> 17:32.523
Take five.

17:35.193 --> 17:37.094
I'm not gonna end up saying
a word in thisovie.

17:37.162 --> 17:38.762
You want me to go
talk to verner?

17:38.897 --> 17:41.565
No, I'll do it.

17:43.802 --> 17:45.569
Ari:
so how is marlo doing?

17:45.603 --> 17:47.104
- well she's the same.
- yeah?

17:47.138 --> 17:48.906
older, flabbier.

17:48.973 --> 17:51.675
Didn't we swear that we
wouldn't keep the women past 45?

17:51.743 --> 17:54.344
My new year's resolution
since 1996.

17:54.412 --> 17:56.113
But it never took.

17:56.181 --> 17:58.182
- how are the kids?
- the kids are great.

17:58.216 --> 17:59.983
- yeah?
- no hollywood for them.

18:00.051 --> 18:02.753
- god is on my side.
- you really don't love this town, huh?

18:02.821 --> 18:06.056
I'm not really
in this town, ari.

18:06.124 --> 18:07.291
I'm a subspecies
all my own.

18:07.325 --> 18:09.159
And you like tt?

18:09.227 --> 18:11.195
You know, yeah.
It's been okay for me.

18:11.262 --> 18:13.063
Really?

18:13.131 --> 18:15.265
Okay, ari, what are you
doing to me?

18:15.333 --> 18:17.167
- are you gonna make me beg?
- no, I'm not gonna make you beg.

18:17.202 --> 18:19.036
Just remember when you
wanted to buy your first car

18:19.104 --> 18:20.971
Out here who cosigned
the loan agreement.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.375
Andrew...

18:26.811 --> 18:29.113
I don't want to give
you the loan.

18:31.249 --> 18:32.916
All right, I understand.
No hard feelings.

18:32.951 --> 18:34.918
I want to buy your company.

18:36.888 --> 18:39.089
- buy my company?
- yeah.

18:41.059 --> 18:42.626
Why would I want to sell?

18:42.694 --> 18:45.262
So you can get back to the place
that you were supposed to be.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.831
I'm doing great.
It's just a cash flow problem.

18:47.899 --> 18:50.567
Andrew, you're like lebron
james if he was playing in Spain.

18:50.635 --> 18:52.202
Sure people know he's good,

18:52.270 --> 18:54.838
But no one wants to eat paella
while watching basketball.

18:54.906 --> 18:56.507
I'm not gonna
sell my company.

18:56.574 --> 18:59.076
I understand if you don't
want to give me a loan.

18:59.144 --> 19:01.011
I want to give you a life-

19:01.079 --> 19:04.615
The life that you and I were
supposed to have together.

19:04.682 --> 19:06.483
You'll make more money,

19:06.551 --> 19:09.253
You'll have more responsibility,
you'll feel better about yourself.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.954
- ari.
- the loan is yours if you want it.

19:11.022 --> 19:13.223
But there's a better
offer on the table.

19:15.326 --> 19:17.261
I need a drink.

19:19.230 --> 19:21.265
Waiter, another scotch.

19:21.332 --> 19:23.067
Make it two, actually.
Doubles.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.337
Hey, how are you?

19:27.405 --> 19:30.174
- I have pages for mr. Patric.
- you can leave those with me.

19:30.241 --> 19:32.142
I'll make sure mr. Patric gets
them as soon as he comes out.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.644
Okay.

19:35.814 --> 19:37.314
Would you hurry up, drama?

19:37.382 --> 19:39.817
<i>Easy does it, turtle.
Easy does it.</i>

19:39.884 --> 19:42.419
All you had to do was hide
the chair back in there.

19:42.487 --> 19:44.521
Come on.

19:46.658 --> 19:49.159
I took the opportunity to
inflict a little damage.

19:49.227 --> 19:51.428
- what kind of damage?
- the number two kind.

19:51.496 --> 19:53.430
You took a shit
in his trailer?

19:53.498 --> 19:55.632
And sue me
if I forgot to flush.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.735
Are you serious?

19:57.802 --> 19:59.970
Let's just say revenge
is best served

20:00.038 --> 20:02.706
- a la commode.
- ugh, gross.

20:02.774 --> 20:05.075
Then we have a track
around there.

20:05.143 --> 20:07.811
- one crane there
and one crane there.

20:07.879 --> 20:09.780
- hi.
- hey.

20:09.848 --> 20:12.449
First day of shooting,
we popped the cherry.

20:12.517 --> 20:14.118
- so how you feeling?
- I feel good.

20:14.185 --> 20:16.520
Good.
I know some actors

20:16.588 --> 20:18.455
Can be thrown by
my way of working.

20:18.523 --> 20:20.090
You know,
no rehearsals and such.

20:20.158 --> 20:22.259
I totally understand.
Everyone has their process.

20:22.394 --> 20:25.262
Yes, it has worked very well
for me in the past.

20:25.296 --> 20:27.297
I think that the lack
of preparation

20:27.365 --> 20:29.266
Gives you a more
natural performance.

20:29.401 --> 20:31.034
Well, as long
as you're happy.

20:31.102 --> 20:34.438
I'm happy.
But you seem troubled.

20:36.207 --> 20:37.808
What's on your mind?

20:37.876 --> 20:39.810
It's just a couple
of my lines.

20:39.878 --> 20:42.212
Your lines?
You don't like them?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.248
Oh no, actually
I really love them.

20:44.315 --> 20:46.850
It's just that jason
ended up saying them.

20:46.918 --> 20:49.586
- oh, that.
- you're aware of it?

20:49.654 --> 20:52.122
Of course I'm aware of it.
It's my set.

20:52.190 --> 20:54.058
I'm aware of everything
that happens.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.559
He's good.
He's good too.

20:55.627 --> 20:57.061
You- take him away.

20:57.128 --> 20:59.430
- you're not troubled by it?
- no.

20:59.497 --> 21:02.166
When I got jason
to agree to do this

21:02.233 --> 21:04.368
I knew that I was
hiring an actor

21:04.436 --> 21:07.871
That was very fiery
and volatile,

21:07.939 --> 21:09.940
But also capable of
a brilliant performance.

21:10.008 --> 21:11.975
So what then?

21:12.043 --> 21:14.845
So it means

21:14.913 --> 21:16.814
I have to pick my battles

21:16.881 --> 21:19.316
Or I might lose them
altogether.

21:19.417 --> 21:20.851
What about me?

21:20.919 --> 21:22.720
You, vincent,

21:22.787 --> 21:25.122
You're stable.

21:25.190 --> 21:27.991
I don't have to worry
about losing you, do I?

21:28.059 --> 21:29.593
I'm just afraid
of losing my character

21:29.661 --> 21:31.729
If he doesn't go into that fire.
You're not worried about that?

21:31.763 --> 21:34.364
I actually think that when we
get to that scene in the third act

21:34.432 --> 21:36.500
Where you are overcome
with smoke,

21:36.568 --> 21:38.569
I think your turning point
will be much better,

21:38.636 --> 21:39.937
More interesting this way.

21:40.004 --> 21:42.139
- really?
- really.

21:42.207 --> 21:45.375
So let me keep an eye
on the big picture

21:45.443 --> 21:47.010
And you keep
an eye on you.

21:47.078 --> 21:49.113
Okay?

21:54.652 --> 21:56.120
How'd it go?

21:56.187 --> 21:58.188
I think old verner's
a bigger pussy than I am.

21:59.624 --> 22:01.458
Someone's got to put
a stop to this.

22:06.297 --> 22:08.165
Juice!

22:08.233 --> 22:10.701
Fucking flush.

22:12.737 --> 22:14.972
- brad pitt.
- no, that's not true.

22:15.039 --> 22:16.940
Oh, which part isn't true?

22:16.975 --> 22:18.142
You never
could have signed him.

22:18.209 --> 22:20.244
What are you talking about?
It was 1989.

22:20.311 --> 22:22.112
It was before they even wrote
"thelma and louise"

22:22.180 --> 22:25.015
And you and I were sitting
with him at nikki blair's

22:25.083 --> 22:28.185
And you said, and I quote
here, "I don't see it. "

22:28.219 --> 22:29.720
- I did not.
- yes, you did.

22:29.788 --> 22:32.423
- you were with your wife.
- oh shit.

22:32.490 --> 22:34.091
That's right.
He flirted with her.

22:34.159 --> 22:35.859
That's why I said it.

22:35.894 --> 22:37.895
- jesus christ, andrew.
- you're telling me.

22:37.929 --> 22:40.364
I wish he'd fucked her.
Shit, I wish he'd married her.

22:40.432 --> 22:42.599
Honey, can I get
a round here?

22:42.667 --> 22:44.368
You want another
shot at brad pitt?

22:44.402 --> 22:47.104
No, ari. At's not what I want anymore.

22:47.172 --> 22:48.539
- you're bullshitting me.
- what?

22:48.606 --> 22:49.940
What?
I am my own boss.

22:50.008 --> 22:52.142
I come and go as I please.
I answer to no one.

22:52.210 --> 22:53.911
You answer to tv hacks.

22:53.945 --> 22:57.247
And a glamorous night out is an
invite to the writer's guild awards.

22:57.315 --> 22:59.049
You don't know what
you're talking about.

22:59.117 --> 23:01.051
I know that you repped
marc cherry for a decade.

23:01.086 --> 23:03.187
And it was the decade that
he lived at home with his mom.

23:03.221 --> 23:05.723
And I know that as soon as
"desperate housewives" hit number one,

23:05.790 --> 23:08.425
We left you for that schmuck
over at william morris.

23:08.493 --> 23:10.794
You stick with me
and I swear to you

23:10.862 --> 23:12.396
No one will leave
you again.

23:12.464 --> 23:14.531
I can't even imagine

23:14.566 --> 23:17.334
- trying to talk to these people anymore.
- I can.

23:17.368 --> 23:20.070
I can imagine you selling
them the way you sold me.

23:20.138 --> 23:22.740
I mean, do you remember
when I was gonna walk

23:22.807 --> 23:25.309
And go back to chicago
and become a lawyer?

23:25.376 --> 23:28.212
- the speech you gave me?
- it wasn't much of a speech.

23:28.279 --> 23:31.815
I just said, "do you really want to
die a loser fucking lawyer in chicago?"

23:31.916 --> 23:34.885
Do you really want to die a
loser lit agent in the valley?

23:38.757 --> 23:40.657
Why are you really
doing this, ari?

23:40.725 --> 23:43.927
Hmm?
Guilt?

23:43.995 --> 23:45.662
You feel bad 'cause I didn't
end up where you are?

23:45.730 --> 23:47.431
I mean, maybe it would have
turned out this way anyway.

23:47.499 --> 23:49.767
You know?
Maybe this was my destiny.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.935
Bullshit.
Destiny brought us here.

23:52.003 --> 23:55.339
The fucking cocksucking
writer's strike brought us here.

23:55.407 --> 23:56.874
- andrew, come on.
- why do you believe in me?

23:56.941 --> 23:59.810
Why after all this time?

23:59.844 --> 24:03.013
Instincts. I follow my
instincts. That's all I got.

24:03.114 --> 24:05.215
If you follow me
I swear to you

24:05.283 --> 24:07.284
It's a game changer.

24:07.352 --> 24:10.187
We were a great team then,
we'll be a great team now.

24:10.255 --> 24:12.856
That head of hair
is too good for the valley.

24:12.924 --> 24:14.625
I'm telling you.

24:14.692 --> 24:16.527
Come on.

24:19.864 --> 24:21.799
Okay okay.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.034
Yeah, let's do it.

24:24.102 --> 24:26.336
Thank you.
Let's do it.

24:26.404 --> 24:28.639
I won't let you down.

24:31.176 --> 24:32.976
I need a minute.
I'm sorry.

24:33.044 --> 24:35.179
All right.

24:37.148 --> 24:39.483
Another round.
We're celebrating.

24:43.154 --> 24:44.488
What, are you drunk, ari?

24:44.556 --> 24:46.590
Drunk on life, babs.

24:46.658 --> 24:49.526
- what do you want?
- expansion. It's time.

24:49.594 --> 24:51.862
I've been begging you for
months. What have you got?

24:51.930 --> 24:55.866
Small literary shop servicing
over 65 working tv writers

24:55.900 --> 24:57.768
With less than
five agents.

24:57.836 --> 25:00.404
- I like it. - uh-huh. Grossed
over $5 million last year.

25:00.472 --> 25:02.439
I really like it.
Which company?

25:02.507 --> 25:03.674
<i>Klein-kuddler.
You heard of them?</i>

25:03.708 --> 25:05.976
- is that andrew klein?
- yup.

25:06.044 --> 25:08.545
- no go, the guy's a loser.
- no he's not.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.247
<i>I'm not talking about
what he makes, ari.</i>

25:10.315 --> 25:12.182
<i>I'm talking about
his general essence.</i>

25:12.217 --> 25:15.185
We need to project
a certain image.

25:15.253 --> 25:17.721
And that washout doesn't
exactly fit the bill.

25:17.789 --> 25:20.190
And what do you project,
menopausal chic?

25:20.258 --> 25:23.560
He's not big agency
material, ari. No go.

25:23.628 --> 25:26.163
I wasn't calling you
for your permission.

25:26.231 --> 25:28.532
<i>Well, read your partnership
agreements then, ari.</i>

25:28.600 --> 25:30.768
Because my permission
is exactly what you need.

25:30.835 --> 25:32.336
Barbara.

25:33.471 --> 25:35.439
Barbara.

25:37.709 --> 25:38.942
I thought you
killed it today.

25:39.010 --> 25:41.712
Killed it? I was
basically moving scenery.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.614
But at least you
looked good, bro.

25:43.681 --> 25:45.949
You got two big scenes coming up that
he's not in so you can make up for it.

25:46.017 --> 25:48.485
He'll probably jump out of a
tree and steal those lines too.

25:48.553 --> 25:50.754
We got a few more
tricks up our sleeves.

25:50.822 --> 25:52.589
Just say the word
and we'll have him in tears.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.024
I appreciate it, johnny.
Thanks.

25:54.092 --> 25:56.060
I hate to see you
like this, vin.

25:56.127 --> 25:58.262
- I'm sorry, turtle.
- I know what might cheer you up.

25:58.329 --> 26:01.365
I saw your favorite, banana cream
pie, over on the buffet table.

26:01.433 --> 26:03.567
- I can grab you a slice.
- that would be nice, thanks.

26:03.635 --> 26:05.569
Slimy thief
approaching at 3:00.

26:05.637 --> 26:07.638
Control yourself,
drama.

26:07.705 --> 26:09.540
Good work, vince.

26:09.607 --> 26:11.909
- I try.
- see you tomorrow, man.

26:11.943 --> 26:13.343
Jason, I loved
your work in "narc. "

26:13.378 --> 26:15.913
Really really
inspirational stuff, man.

26:15.947 --> 26:18.115
- really? Thanks,
- take it easy.

26:18.149 --> 26:20.384
What the hell was that?

26:25.824 --> 26:27.458
Hey.

26:31.162 --> 26:33.030
Get a paper towel,
will you?

26:39.270 --> 26:40.904
Thought you were
getting me pie.

26:40.972 --> 26:42.239
Got you a cookie.

26:42.307 --> 26:43.707
What about the pie?

26:43.775 --> 26:45.976
- jason took it.
- what do you mean?

26:46.010 --> 26:48.679
I mean, I waited in line
and when I got to the pie

26:48.747 --> 26:50.581
<i>He swooped in
and took the last piece.</i>

26:50.648 --> 26:52.416
- and you let him?
- he's imposing.

26:52.484 --> 26:55.185
That's it.
Hey, jason.

26:55.253 --> 26:56.854
What's up, vince?

26:56.955 --> 26:58.822
Did you take that pie
from turtle?

26:58.890 --> 27:00.891
Turtle?

27:00.959 --> 27:02.593
Yeah, this guy.
My friend.

27:02.660 --> 27:04.628
He's waiting in line for
this pie and you took it.

27:04.696 --> 27:07.398
- I did?
- you kinda did.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.533
Oh, I'm sorry
about that, man.

27:09.634 --> 27:12.603
And while we're on the subject, you
kinda took a few of my lines today too.

27:12.670 --> 27:14.972
- tell him, bro.
- what lines?

27:15.039 --> 27:16.907
All of them.

27:16.975 --> 27:19.243
I don't seem to be
following where we're going,

27:19.310 --> 27:21.278
But there seems to be
a bit of a problem here.

27:21.346 --> 27:22.980
Yeah, the big monologue
in the first scene,

27:23.047 --> 27:24.548
Advice to malone
in the third scene.

27:24.616 --> 27:26.316
- verner gave me those lines.
- verner?

27:26.384 --> 27:29.386
Verner, our director.

27:29.421 --> 27:31.021
I assumed you knew that.

27:31.056 --> 27:33.257
- well, I didn't,
- now you do.

27:33.324 --> 27:35.292
So why don't you go
take that up with him?

27:35.360 --> 27:38.328
Because any confusion that there
seems to be has nothing to do with me.

27:42.834 --> 27:44.568
<i>Verner:
hello.</i>

27:44.636 --> 27:46.470
I want to
thank you, everybody,

27:46.538 --> 27:48.839
For a fantastic first day.

27:48.907 --> 27:52.476
auf uns!
