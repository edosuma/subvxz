00:26.280 --> 00:29.272
This engine won't start.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.670
You're home from school early.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.594
Yeah, well, I sort of dropped out
for the rest of the semester.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.876
Clark, how could you do that?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.957
You need me here.
There's too much work.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.873
- But...
- Mom, it's done.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.311
The governor's office
wants to see me.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.675
Something about
your father's senate seat.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.832
It's the last thing I wanna do,
but I have to go to Metropolis.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.436
While I'm there, <i>I...</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:05.354
I thought I'd drop some of your father's
clothes off at the homeless shelter.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.870
Maybe it's too early
to get rid of them, but I...

01:11.200 --> 01:13.509
It's so hard seeing them in the closet.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.756
I can still smell his after-shave
on the shirts.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.156
You should take a look, see if
there's something you wanna keep.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.999
No, I'm sure there's someone
who can use it more than I can.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.154
I think your father would have
wanted you to have this.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.399
L... I remember the day he taught you
how to tell time with it.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.152
You should wear it.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.148
Well, if you're going to Metropolis,
you should go before it gets too dark.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.918
- Hey, lady, need some help?
- No. Thank you. I can manage.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.355
Don't do that.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.156
- No!
- Nice bling, red.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.358
That was my husband's.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.871
Crazy bitch.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.512
Slit her throat.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.195
I've been looking for you.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.351
Hey, back off, freak...

03:48.520 --> 03:50.476
...or I cut her.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.188
Don't worry, you're safe now.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.674
Hey.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.314
The muses weren't helping me
with my astronomy paper...

05:34.480 --> 05:37.438
<i>...so</i> I thought I'd come by
and talk you into a frothy cappucc...

05:37.600 --> 05:40.398
I was on my way to the hardware store.
I gotta pick up some supplies.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.834
Clark, are you sure it can't wait?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.956
Because I was really hoping
we could talk.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.669
Clark, I understand.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.556
You and your dad were really close.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.757
- Lana...
- You don't have to open up to me.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.276
You just can't keep
bottling this up inside.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.753
Thanks for coming by. I really have to go,
the hardware store closes in a half-hour.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.319
I'm sorry.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.319
No, you're angry.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.797
And you should be,
but don't keep hiding behind it.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.791
Trust me, I've tried.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.319
I know you're trying to help.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.272
Thank you,
but you don't have to worry about me.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.757
I'm fine.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.077
Mom? What happened? Oh, my God.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.596
I was dropping off the clothes,
these two guys came out of nowhere.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.512
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.831
Clark, somebody rescued me.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.512
But not before they...
They took your father's watch.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.395
I just spent half the night
down at Metropolis PD.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.994
Not one person can tell me
about who mugged my mom.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.435
No, I've got that covered.
My mole at the precinct...

07:06.600 --> 07:10.559
<i>...said</i> that he'd fax me the police report.
So your mom actually saw the vigilante?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.915
Barely. She left
just before the police got there.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.197
There have been rumors about her
flying around Suicide Slums for weeks.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.874
But I couldn't get a confirmed eyewitness
until your mom.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.350
Now this has front-page news
written all over it.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.672
- The vigilante is for real.
- This is great, Chloe.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.638
I let my mom go down to Suicide Slums
alone, she gets mugged...

07:29.800 --> 07:31.153
<i>...and</i> you're cashing in on it.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.592
Clark, I was just trying to help.
You don't have to bite my head off.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.990
I should've accepted the watch
like my dad would've wanted.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.957
I couldn't even look at it.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.473
Now all I can think about
is getting it back.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.674
I'm sorry.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.518
I'm sorry.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.158
- They are today's obits.
- Thanks.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.588
I saw your car out front.
Looks like old habits die hard.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.069
Mrs. Kent asked me to close up
for the night.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.196
They're going through a lot right now.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.399
Look...

08:35.720 --> 08:38.029
- Lana...
- Lex, it's okay.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.236
You already said, "I'm sorry."

08:40.400 --> 08:42.356
Yeah, well, it means more
when it's <i>coming...</i>

08:42.520 --> 08:44.476
<i>...from</i> someone who's not drunk.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.478
It seemed you were pretty upset
with Clark that night. Things better?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.274
None of that matters anymore.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.115
I just wanna be able to help him
through this difficult time.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.998
How's he doing?

09:00.800 --> 09:04.395
Lex, we both know what it's like
to lose a parent. He's devastated.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.678
Yeah, I tried to get ahold of him,
but he doesn't wanna see me.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.513
Well, as much
as we both wanna help...

09:11.680 --> 09:14.831
...I think all we can do
is really just be there for him.

09:16.480 --> 09:20.359
He's... He's very lucky
to have you in his life, Lana.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.715
But when the time comes
for you to lean on someone...

09:27.840 --> 09:29.831
<i>...you</i> know I'm always here.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.833
All right. Now, this
is what I need, Clark:

09:51.000 --> 09:53.992
A catchy moniker
for our new crime fighter.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.315
"Miss Death-Wish." No, that's lame.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.597
"Dirty Harriet."
No, that's too derivative.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.398
I got it. I got it, Clark.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.154
So your mom said that she
swooped down from the heavens.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.278
So how about
"The Angel of v engeance."

10:10.880 --> 10:13.519
- Chloe, police report.
- Right. I'm sorry, clark.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.035
Once I go Woodward and Bernstein,
I get carried away.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.952
I'll go check the fax.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.555
I heard you were asking around
about me.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.951
Something tells me a front-page story
could be a little bad for my health.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.271
- Let it go, <i>comprende?</i>
- Hey, what are you doing?

11:01.200 --> 11:03.873
Stay out of my way.
I'm one of the good guys.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.311
- Clark, are you all right?
- Yeah.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.159
I guess round one
goes to the X chromosomes, huh?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.276
How about that costume,
how cool was that?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.158
A little over the top.
Police reports?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.232
Oh, yeah, of course. You know,
chokehold and everything aside...

11:30.400 --> 11:32.960
...I gotta give the girl props
for patrolling the street.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.317
Now, I just wonder if we're dealing
with natural-born-ninja territory...

11:36.480 --> 11:38.948
<i>...or</i> if she's just another
garden-variety meteor freak.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.315
- Whatever she is, she's got issues.
- Come on, Clark.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.879
You can't tell me
that you have never crossed...

11:43.040 --> 11:45.600
...any boundaries
to protect your identity.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.957
Looks like I'm gonna have to get
to know her a lot more than I wanted to.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.680
No leads. Your Angel of Vengeance
might be the only one...

11:51.840 --> 11:53.671
...who can ID the guys
who mugged my mom.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.558
After the way she chop-sockied
you tonight...

11:55.720 --> 11:58.154
<i>...I</i> wouldn't hold out
for an invitation to tea.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.352
We might not have to.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.478
- No! No. Please help. No. No. Help!
- Give me the purse.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.269
No! Help me. Help me!

12:26.920 --> 12:29.753
You know what? We've taken
this show on the road all over town...

12:29.920 --> 12:31.512
<i>...and</i> this obviously isn't working.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.477
Because you're not
screaming loud enough.

12:33.640 --> 12:38.794
Clark, I have freaked out every alley cat
within a four-block radius.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.709
Look, let's just go one more time.
One more, come on. Take it, come on.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.395
- Ready? Go.
- No. Help. Please.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.993
- Come on.
- No. Please. Help.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.435
You gotta give it some feeling,
some passion.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.397
Stop!

12:55.160 --> 12:56.832
You again?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.072
- I didn't come here for a fight.
- Well, I'm not wearing dance shoes.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.433
If I'd known you wanted a duel,
I would've brought my own pistol.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.469
Oh, no, this isn't a weapon, Lex.
This is a piece of history.

13:57.640 --> 14:01.189
A gift
from a grateful overseas partner.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.989
That's right, a duel would require you
to face your opponent.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.909
You prefer to strike
when they least expect it.

14:10.720 --> 14:14.110
Oh, yeah, the activity this morning
in the Asian markets.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.952
Is that what you mean? I heard.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.876
Brokers were buying up shares
of LuthorCorp...

14:20.040 --> 14:22.076
...like they were half-price potstickers.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.037
Come on, Dad...

14:24.560 --> 14:27.120
...you're just using the chinese.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.068
I know you're the one leading
the Apex Group's hostile takeover.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.150
And I didn't think
you were paying attention.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.151
I'm pleased to see
that is not the case.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.392
Wipe that smug smile off your face.
I won't let it happen.

14:42.560 --> 14:46.155
How you gonna stop it?
Leveraged recapitalization?

14:46.320 --> 14:52.031
Your campaign directly compromised
Luthorcorp's assets.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.351
There's not a single bank
that will give you the money you need.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.515
So, what are you gonna do
for an encore?

14:59.680 --> 15:03.355
- Put a bullet in my head?
- Don't be so melodramatic, Lex.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.555
I would never fire this. It's priceless.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.599
You know, General MacArthur wore this
when he came back to the Philippines.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.793
What was it he said, son?

15:15.240 --> 15:17.913
"I have returned."

15:20.040 --> 15:22.600
Don't get ahead of yourself, Dad.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.917
You haven't taken the beach yet.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.794
You want a show-and-tell, meathead?
Why don't you go first.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.835
I don't know.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.476
I was born this way.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.909
You're lucky. The worst part
is remembering...

15:58.080 --> 16:00.275
...what it was like to be normal.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.512
- But then how did you...?
- Turn into a freak of nature?

16:06.400 --> 16:10.109
When I got a heart transplant,
six months ago.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.952
A girl dies in a meteor shower...

16:12.120 --> 16:16.272
...and suddenly I get a souped-up
second chance. You have no idea...

16:16.440 --> 16:20.228
<i>...what</i> it's like to know that
someone's life has been traded for yours.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.913
That's why I carry this.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.634
So I'll never forget.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.392
I'm kind of allergic.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.632
To a rock? Okay, whatever.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.272
So I guess you and Sullivan have
all the dirt you need on me now...

16:42.440 --> 16:43.919
...to write your little article.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.752
I'm not here to expose you.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.674
I need your help.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.671
You saved my mom earlier tonight.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.513
Some guys were trying to mug her
outside the Eastside shelter.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.035
- They took a watch.
- Sorry...

16:55.200 --> 16:57.316
...but there are people down here
who need a lot more help...

16:57.480 --> 16:59.072
...than finding some missing Timex.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.912
Belonged to my dad.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.392
You lost him, didn't you?
And you can't say goodbye.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.598
- What makes you say that?
- Because I've never been able to.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.275
My mom and I were coming home
from my gymnastics meet...

17:21.960 --> 17:24.473
...and these two guys mugged us.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.033
I didn't even feel the knife
go into my heart.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.193
When I looked up...

17:32.200 --> 17:34.270
...I saw her lying there.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.030
And they walked away laughing.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.309
Is that why you do this?

17:43.720 --> 17:47.918
She dedicated her life
to this group, Acrata.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.197
They fought the gangs, the dealers...

17:51.360 --> 17:54.238
...even the suits who wanted
to tear down our homes.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.348
She was this little woman...

17:59.520 --> 18:02.239
...but she was a badass.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.072
It's not fair.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.675
It's not fair to have someone like that
just ripped out of your life.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.551
I can help you get the watch back.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.471
But that's not
what you're really after, is it?

18:21.840 --> 18:27.278
- You want justice, just like me.
- Can you tell me where they are?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.635
They're part of
the Thirteenth Street Gang...

18:30.200 --> 18:32.509
...but the guy you want
has gone underground...

18:32.680 --> 18:34.910
<i>...and</i> his gang's all packing 9 mils.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.070
But I'm in if you're in.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.598
- Mrs. Kent, what are you doing here?
- Looking for Clark. Have you seen him?

19:06.280 --> 19:09.317
Yeah, about an hour ago,
he left me holding the bag, literally.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.036
Hey, you know, I heard what happened.
It's good to see that you're okay.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.549
Don't worry about clark.
I'm sure he'll pop up soon.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.396
- Or blur in, or whatever it is he does.
- He's been gone all night.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.269
He's not answering his cell phone.
It's not like him.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.476
There's a lot
that's not been like him lately.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.551
He's trying to find those guys,
isn't he?

19:31.520 --> 19:34.273
Chloe, I know you have a lot
of secrets you have to keep...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.271
<i>...but</i> this isn't one of them.

19:39.200 --> 19:44.228
- He feels really guilty about the watch.
- And me.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.959
Well, I think he's willing to feel anything
except for the pain of saying goodbye.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.631
But that doesn't keep it
from being real.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.678
The more he refuses to go through this,
the worse it's gonna get.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.753
I know.
I'm trying to do everything I <i>can...</i>

19:59.920 --> 20:02.639
<i>...but</i> I don't think denial's
that unusual.

20:02.800 --> 20:07.032
But clark is. He's gotta take
all those emotions out somewhere.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.189
- Or on someone.
- And when he does...

20:11.360 --> 20:14.875
<i>...I'm</i> afraid of what might happen.
We both know what he's capable of.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.237
Yeah, but clark's always managed
to keep things in perspective.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.154
It's just that Jonathan
was always there.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.834
He always knew what to say.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.152
Mrs. Kent,
I don't think that he was the only one.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.471
When he died...

20:36.920 --> 20:40.879
<i>...I</i> really didn't know
if I could keep the secret by myself.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.155
It's good to know you're here.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.358
Thank you.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.790
He's gonna be okay.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.714
We won't let anything happen to him.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.792
That's the guy he was with.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.793
Sorry, this isn't a costume party.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.672
Whoa there, Jethro.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.276
Maybe you should put the brawn away
and let the brains handle this.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.399
Looks like somebody got the best of you.
We're looking for that friend of yours.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.597
You know, the one
with the serpentine-facial graffiti.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.354
- So why you talking to me?
- Because he's gone kind of AWOL.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.274
- And he's got something of mine.
- We want it back. Tell us where he is.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.990
You know what? Just tell
him we're looking for him.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.989
What are you doing?
So much for brains winning out.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.991
<i>Snake, it's Ono. That chick</i>
<i>showed up with some boy scout.</i>

21:53.160 --> 21:55.469
<i>They said to tell you</i>
<i>they're looking for you.</i>

22:06.960 --> 22:08.996
Can you check the last number
he dialed?

22:09.160 --> 22:11.879
Well, I guess my go-to status
has been reinstated.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.837
For a while there,
I thought maybe I'd been <i>replaced...</i>

22:14.000 --> 22:16.230
...by the leather-clad version.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.398
- You always change in a phone booth?
- The janitor was in the bathroom.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.718
I thought the glasses were fake?

22:26.880 --> 22:29.269
Are you kidding? I'm blind as a bat.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.477
Besides, the mask doesn't look
so good with glasses over it.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.510
Acuvue to the rescue.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.956
Those were some impressive moves
you used to jack that phone.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.795
- I could use a sidekick more often.
- I'm not a sidekick.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.719
We should find a reverse list.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.350
Yeah, and then maybe we can
just bypass the log-on page.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.238
Got it covered.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.713
That's why you work here, isn't it?

22:52.920 --> 22:55.957
Nothing happens in Metropolis
without going through the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

22:56.480 --> 22:59.233
Way to put the pieces
together, Brenda Starr.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.150
Unless Snake's real name is Beatrice
Krauss, I think he's using a stolen phone.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.992
Can you pull up the outgoing calls?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.788
Looks like he's a proud
supporter of Fantasy Fone.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.349
More importantly, deep-dish pizza.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.034
Yes, I'd like to make
an order for delivery.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.351
My number's 555-0138.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.193
1436 Stanton Street.
Yes, that's my address. Thank you.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.999
Looks like it's time to call the police.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.593
- No.
- No.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.832
Clark, don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.833
Chloe, if I don't use my abilities
to stop lowlifes like this...

23:43.000 --> 23:45.070
...what's the point in having them?

23:45.240 --> 23:47.913
I really don't think
that you should be go...

23:57.280 --> 24:00.750
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.670
How is it that trash like you
is still alive, and my dad's dead?

24:12.440 --> 24:14.237
Better leave now or you'll be dead too.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.197
You stole my dad's watch.
I want it back.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.430
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.673
- I don't have it anymore. I sold it.
- It was my dad's.

24:33.720 --> 24:37.349
What are you waiting for?
He deserves to die.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.040
- Lf you won't kill him, I will.
- No.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.832
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.517
You.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.356
Is this the knife
you used to kill my mother?

25:15.520 --> 25:17.431
No. He's not worth it.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.991
You didn't have to kill her.
She gave you all the money she had.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.755
It wasn't about the money.
I was told to make it look like a mugging.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.950
- It was a hit?
- She was in their way.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.032
Whose? Who hired you?

25:32.720 --> 25:36.190
The suits. Those Apex suits, the ones
that are tearing down the slums.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.510
I want a name.

25:38.880 --> 25:39.995
Andrea.

25:41.560 --> 25:45.951
All I know is, the guy that hired me
got a call from Lionel Luthor.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.353
Don't.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.835
No!

26:33.880 --> 26:37.873
I see you've already moved in. Don't you
think that's a little premature, Dad?

26:38.040 --> 26:40.110
The board doesn't meet
on the bid until morning.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.271
I value efficiency, Lex. You know that.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.555
I hear you ran
a hectic phone bank today.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.554
Must be humbling to pull all those strings
and find out they're attached to nothing.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.837
Especially when your father's
the one holding the scissors.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.915
You left the company vulnerable.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.120
Then I suppose
I should be thanking you.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.794
If you hadn't tried to take it,
someone else would have.

27:06.960 --> 27:11.556
Exactly. What good is having a family
if they don't watch out for each other?

27:13.880 --> 27:16.235
On the off chance...

27:16.400 --> 27:20.279
...that unshakable family loyalty fails...

27:20.440 --> 27:23.193
...there's always those Luthor closets
to rummage through.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.351
All right. Let's skip the prologue, Lex.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.829
What ancient skeleton
do you think you've dug up now?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.151
Well, it's not quite a skeleton yet.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.073
More like a freshly laid corpse.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.630
I wonder
how Martha Kent would feel...

27:42.800 --> 27:47.476
...if she knew you had a secret meeting
with her husband right before he died.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.519
Now, a transgression like that would...

27:52.680 --> 27:56.150
...test the virtues of even
the most forgiving woman.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.511
What do you want, Lex?

28:08.720 --> 28:11.473
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.276
Sorry it was so short.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.119
Snake?

28:35.240 --> 28:36.878
Snake?

28:40.760 --> 28:43.672
You're a dead man.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.031
You kicked people
out of their homes...

29:08.200 --> 29:10.430
...so you could develop
Suicide Slums for profit.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.910
My mother stood up to you,
so you had her murdered.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.231
No one escapes justice, Luthor.
Not even you.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.710
Listen to me. We're not as different
as you might think.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.393
Like you know anything about me.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.030
I do. I grew up on the same
treacherous streets that you did.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.158
I lost my parents, just like you did,
to a senseless crime.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.390
It wasn't senseless. It was calculated.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.917
Andrea. Stop. Let the police do their job.
If he's guilty, he'll pay.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.230
If your father was murdered...

29:38.400 --> 29:42.393
...and you were face to face
with his killer, what would you do?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.150
What if you're wrong?
What if he had nothing to do with it?

29:46.840 --> 29:50.435
Andrea, listen to him. Listen.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.989
Look, I know what's in your heart.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.317
It's anger. I feel it too.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.233
But killing him, taking his life
is not gonna change anything.

30:00.400 --> 30:04.598
- Yes, it will.
- Andrea, stop. Think about your mother.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.874
Is this what she would
want you to do?

30:12.760 --> 30:15.877
Let him go.
Let him go and everything will be okay.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.070
I killed a man.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.874
And I know you, Clark.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.873
You could never let me
walk out of here.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.876
It's time for you to be the real hero.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.992
Exceptional woman.
Grossly misguided.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.355
She's been through a lot.

31:03.320 --> 31:08.110
Why do I think you saved my life
for her sake, not for mine?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.270
Whatever the reason...

31:14.040 --> 31:15.996
...thank you, son.

32:21.280 --> 32:25.034
Martha, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.633
It's all right.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.992
I was somewhere else.

32:29.160 --> 32:34.393
Yes. These days must be difficult
to get through. I understand.

32:35.640 --> 32:39.553
When my wife... When Lillian died, I...

32:40.800 --> 32:43.439
I thought I'd never
be whole again. I...

32:45.000 --> 32:47.560
It takes a long time
to let yourself heal.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.314
Well, I'm doing the best I can.

32:53.320 --> 32:57.871
I hear the governor has asked you
to take Jonathan's seat in the senate.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.432
I haven't even told clark about that.
How do you know?

33:04.240 --> 33:07.550
I make it a point to know things. I...

33:07.720 --> 33:09.756
I wanted to find out how you were.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.516
I'm not sure I'm going to
accept the offer.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.399
If you came by to sway me
one way or the other.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.633
No, you're quite capable of making
that decision on your own. I...

33:20.800 --> 33:24.270
I'm only sorry
that they burdened you with this.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.113
You've got so much
to deal with now, Martha.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.037
I know that Jonathan leveraged
a good part of the farm.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.192
- That was his decision.
- That was his pride.

33:35.360 --> 33:39.194
So he could pay back
the campaign contribution I made.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.710
I can't accept it.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.435
Jonathan and I let politics
and money come between us.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.752
I don't want that
to happen to us, Martha.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.760
If you need anything...

34:12.920 --> 34:15.797
...please, I'm here for you, always.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.310
As a friend.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.717
Hey.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.789
I found her desk like this
when I got in this morning.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.428
I called her home, her cell.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.159
Looks like she pulled
an Amelia Earhart.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.553
She's never gonna let
anyone find her now.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.911
I guess exile's the price
you have to pay...

34:50.080 --> 34:52.469
...when you play judge,
jury and executioner.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.358
Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.560
Clark, what really happened out there?

35:00.720 --> 35:04.508
I should have listened to you, Chloe.
You tried to warn me.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.076
I had my hand
around that guy's throat.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.909
And I thought that if I just kept
squeezing the life out of him...

35:15.120 --> 35:17.076
...then it would make
everything right again.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.957
God, Clark.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.517
- But you didn't?
- No.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.110
What made you stop?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.039
My dad's voice.

35:32.640 --> 35:36.758
This is gonna sound weird,
but l... I could hear him.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.112
He was the one who always kept me
from going over the edge...

35:39.280 --> 35:41.191
...when I was too close.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.635
It's too bad Andrea
didn't step back in time.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.315
I think Metropolis could really
use someone like her right now.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.675
Do you think you could ever
do what she did?

35:55.840 --> 36:00.118
Play the mild-mannered reporter by day
and a crime fighter by night?

36:00.760 --> 36:03.877
Honestly, I'm kind of hoping
I can find a way...

36:04.040 --> 36:06.793
...to not have to hide who I really am.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.037
I searched every pawnshop
in Metropolis for it.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.754
I can't believe you found this.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.832
Lana...

36:44.720 --> 36:47.109
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.636
I know I should be able to move on,
but life without him...

36:53.560 --> 36:55.471
...doesn't feel real.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.312
It's like you're <i>frozen...</i>

36:58.480 --> 37:01.995
<i>...and</i> the whole world's
going on around you.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.672
No matter how many people
wanna be there for you...

37:06.840 --> 37:09.479
...you end up going through this alone.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.390
It's not like he ever let me take
the easy way out either, huh?

37:20.640 --> 37:22.358
Put it on.

37:34.480 --> 37:39.429
It looks great.
Your dad would be really happy.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.918
<i>Here, go that way.</i>
<i>Make a figure eight.</i>

37:51.080 --> 37:52.354
<i>Please be careful.</i>

37:52.520 --> 37:54.988
<i>Don 't worry, sweetheart.</i>
<i>It's gonna be fine.</i>

37:55.160 --> 37:57.230
<i>That's what you always say.</i>

38:02.000 --> 38:03.433
<i>- That way?</i>
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

38:03.600 --> 38:05.397
<i>What, are you kidding?</i>

38:06.520 --> 38:09.751
<i>This young man 's a man of steel.</i>
<i>Look at him.</i>

38:10.960 --> 38:12.712
<i>- Make one more turn.</i>
