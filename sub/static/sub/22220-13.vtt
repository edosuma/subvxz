WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.999
Crichton:
Hey, hey, hey, I am doing it.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.251
Whoa... wait...
I'm-I'm not doing it.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.627
You're doing it barely,
but just...

00:09.719 --> 00:11.459
Don't show me, don't show me.

00:11.554 --> 00:14.717
Port side, port-side thrusters.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.303
Slicker 'n snot.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.976
My microbes had to have
translated that one wrongly.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.394
Southern metaphors, darlin'.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.267
You ain't heard the
half of them.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.940
You know, you're picking
this up more slowly than
the dumbest recruit.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.064
But I am picking it up, Aeryn.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.237
The more I modify my module
with Moya add-ons

00:31.324 --> 00:34.236
the more I need to understand
bio-mechanoid technology.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.201
Now, you do that one again
and I'll kill you.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.125
Oh, sorry. Almost hit that
big sun out there.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.497
There's nothing out
there, John.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.874
Exactly, Aeryn.
That's why we picked this spot.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.127
Perfect for a driving lesson.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.211
Like a big mall parking lot
on a Sunday morning.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.849
| used to have 70,000 servants.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.935
Rygel, why don't you get
yourself something to eat?

01:10.029 --> 01:12.736
And during festivals,
I had 50,000 more.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.359
( loud buzzing tone
as Rygel taps)

01:14.450 --> 01:16.941
Mostly females.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.116
Rygel?

01:18.204 --> 01:20.286
They would worry about my
ever nano-moment.

01:20.373 --> 01:23.080
Make sure I was always smiling,
always entertained...

01:23.167 --> 01:23.917
Rygel!

01:24.001 --> 01:25.161
and never bored.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.914
I'm bored.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.995
Bored, bored, bored!

01:29.090 --> 01:30.421
Will you stop doing that?!

01:30.508 --> 01:33.420
Look, whatever you're doing
there, it can't be important.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.047
You're just scared l'll win.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.343
Come on, let's play.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.341
I can't take Moya's pregnancy
much longer.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.548
The walls on my cell are
excreting some sort of gel,

01:40.643 --> 01:42.599
and Pilot says it's due
to Moya's condition.

01:42.687 --> 01:45.850
The Center Chamber has a strange
odor as well. Have you noticed?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.430
l have a Luxan's
olfactory sense.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.607
How can I not notice?

01:49.694 --> 01:52.436
Where the hezmana are Crichton
and Aeryn? They should
be back by now.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.236
Teaching Crichton takes
time, D'argo.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.234
Teaching Crichton is a
waste of time.

01:56.325 --> 02:00.068
Am I the only one here that
remembers we are being tracked
by bounty hunters?

02:00.162 --> 02:04.246
Aeryn believes that anything we
can do to make Crichton more
effective, the better.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.994
This sector is very peaceful.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.700
It's perfect for
Crichton's trai...

02:07.795 --> 02:08.955
Rygel!

02:09.046 --> 02:10.832
If you do not stop that
this instant...

02:10.923 --> 02:13.255
You'll what? Please do tell.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.300
It may be preferable to this
mind-numbing tedium.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.877
Shut up!

02:19.181 --> 02:21.718
Aeryn, lighten up.
Have some fun.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.470
Fun? How am | to have fun?

02:23.561 --> 02:26.769
Oh, I don't know how you're
supposed to have fun,
but this is fun.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.347
This is Top Gun. This is
the need for speed.

02:29.442 --> 02:30.306
You like this stuff. Admit it.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.767
l have no need for speed.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.898
Yes, you do. | see it in your
eye all the time.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.071
You miss the adrenalin of
combat flying.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.194
I miss the teamwork of
combat flying.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.241
The reason why I agreed to
teach you to do this

02:41.329 --> 02:45.242
is because you may become
vaguely of some use to me
one day in battle.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.700
Oh. Well, thank you for that
vote of confidence.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.330
Well you may have noticed
we're short of hands.

02:50.421 --> 02:53.254
I didn't exactly have
much choice.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.925
Watch out for the starboard
thrusters. You're banking
too sharply.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.342
I got it.

02:58.429 --> 03:01.262
What exactly do you mean
by 'vaguely useful'?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.340
Well you're hardly a quick
learner, are you?

03:03.434 --> 03:06.847
Oh, are you trying to tell me
you weren't the least
bit challenged

03:06.937 --> 03:08.768
learning to fly one
of these things?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.596
Not challenged the way
you seem to be.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.192
And you have it easy here.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.392
At Peacekeeper training,
there's no room for mistakes.

03:14.487 --> 03:18.230
You screw up on the last day of
simulation flying, you die.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.320
Right. The simulator kills you.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.335
Now why does that not
surprise me?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.832
Chrichton:
What are you doing back there?

03:34.924 --> 03:37.006
Getting something to eat.
I always get hungry when l...

03:37.093 --> 03:38.958
Oh!

03:39.053 --> 03:40.634
-What was that?
-What was that?

03:40.721 --> 03:41.881
What did you touch?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.803
|didn't touch anything.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.848
Aeryn, any idea what this is?

03:49.939 --> 03:51.554
Aeryn:
No, I don't.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.810
Crichton:
There's something pulling
us in.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.310
Still pulling us in.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.487
I'm not getting any
pulse-back soundings.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.733
That's impossible.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.110
Well, you think I'm
making this up?

04:02.201 --> 04:04.192
Look at it, there's nothing
out there.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.117
I can't hold her!

04:15.506 --> 04:17.872
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

04:17.967 --> 04:21.334
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

04:21.429 --> 04:23.886
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

04:23.973 --> 04:27.386
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:27.476 --> 04:28.261
Help me...

04:28.352 --> 04:29.717
Listen, please.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.973
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:32.064 --> 04:35.932
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:36.026 --> 04:38.312
...doing everything I can...

04:38.404 --> 04:40.816
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.473
Aeryn?

05:06.557 --> 05:07.763
Aeryn!

05:07.850 --> 05:08.839
You okay?

05:08.934 --> 05:10.925
Aeryn!

05:11.020 --> 05:12.885
Damn. Don't scare me like that.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.767
Scare you? What, you think I
had something to do with that?

05:15.858 --> 05:18.099
No, I thought you might...
never mind.

05:18.194 --> 05:19.934
You going to be all right?

05:20.029 --> 05:21.235
Think so. You?

05:21.322 --> 05:22.903
If you don't count
3 broken neck.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.732
A couple of aspirin,
I'll be fine.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.782
We hit something.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.985
No, we didn't.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.286
Hey, look, I was in a head-on
when l was 19.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.113
We hit something.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.494
There's nothing out there.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.246
There's no mass readings.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.544
No mass? How can there
be no mass?

05:38.631 --> 05:40.838
Something's blocking our view.

05:42.218 --> 05:45.210
The sensors say there's still
nothing out there.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.589
What the hell does that mean?!

05:46.680 --> 05:48.261
I don't know.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.885
Will you stop playing
with that?!

05:49.975 --> 05:52.352
I will play this thing for
as long as I like...

05:52.436 --> 05:55.052
(loud squealing tone)

05:55.147 --> 05:56.182
Pilot!

05:56.273 --> 05:57.137
So sorry.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.064
I appear to have hit
the wrong comm.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.687
You desired our attention,
Pilot.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.770
An unidentified vessel
is approaching.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.480
It is signaling, asking
permission to come aboard.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.906
Is it armed?

06:07.993 --> 06:08.982
That depends.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.784
What do you mean, "it depends"?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.613
Moya's scan has found traces
of weapon pieces.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.208
"Pieces?"

06:15.292 --> 06:17.578
But nothing that constitutes
a whole weapon,

06:17.670 --> 06:19.786
and certainly nothing
operational.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.465
It seems a most...
curious vessel.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.812
The name's Staanz.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.308
(chuckling):
Oh, there's no need for
the firepower, friend.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.186
I disagree... "friend." Move.

06:41.277 --> 06:43.643
That pretty little female here's
not going to look at you in
quite the same way

06:43.737 --> 06:45.989
when she learns you killed
the only person that could
have saved you.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.404
Saved us from what?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.197
You see how much you need me?

06:49.285 --> 06:50.821
You're headed straight for it,
and you don't even know
it's there.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.321
Headed for what?

06:52.413 --> 06:53.243
The Flax.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.786
What is that?

06:54.873 --> 06:57.205
It's a magna drift mesh,
75 million zachrons long.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.329
I've never heard of anything
called "The Flax."

06:59.420 --> 07:01.001
-And what species are you?
-Luxan.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.329
Luxan? Never heard of it.
Doesn't mean you don't exist.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.461
Our ship's sensors have not
picked up anything that
size in this area.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.088
Well, they wouldn't have picked
up much of anything.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.009
That's The Flax. It's invisible
till you get snagged in it.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.507
Then it's all over.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.714
Who put it there?

07:12.808 --> 07:13.968
Zenetan pirates.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.015
You never heard of them?
Consider yourself lucky.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.059
I will warn Crichton and Aeryn.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.646
Staanz:
You got another ship out there?

07:24.737 --> 07:28.321
Well warning them's probably a
good idea, you know, if you're
not already too late.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.152
What exactly are you?

07:31.243 --> 07:32.699
My name's Staanz.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.160
I'm a Garbologist.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.535
I'm a, uh... connoisseur of
what other people throw away.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.288
Define "connoisseur."

07:41.920 --> 07:42.875
Tadek,eh?

07:42.963 --> 07:43.998
Ah!

07:49.136 --> 07:51.673
Your set's in, um...
very nice shape.

07:51.764 --> 07:52.970
Do you play?

07:53.057 --> 07:55.389
Oh, I used to... dabble.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.055
You any good?

07:59.146 --> 08:02.138
Perhaps you could give me
a few... pointers.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.610
Perhaps I can.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.606
Oh...

08:08.697 --> 08:10.858
Mmm... mm-hmm.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.033
We need to get the ship
stabilized and assess
the damage.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.625
"Stabilized"?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.291
According to this,
we're too stable.

08:23.379 --> 08:25.620
We're not moving. There's
no drift, no spin...

08:25.714 --> 08:26.669
What?

08:26.757 --> 08:27.872
l-l don't know.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.093
It's as though we're suspended
in one place.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.135
The sooner we get this thing
fixed and blast out of here,
the better.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.390
No comms signal.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.964
Probably busted in the crash.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.799
No. The equipment's working
just fine.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.725
It's just there's no signal
out there.

08:40.813 --> 08:46.524
Aeryn, if I'm reading this
right, calorics are flat line.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.599
We don't have any power.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.901
Oh, that's impossible.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.363
l fed the batteries just
before we left Moya.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.358
Yeah... impossible.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.733
This isn't good.

08:55.828 --> 08:58.069
I can't make contact with
the Transport Pod.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.949
Aeryn and Crichton aren't
responding.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.246
They can't be that far out.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.289
Staanz's story about The Flax
could be true.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.208
It could be what's affecting
the comms transmission.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.160
If it is, if he did
come to warn us,

09:07.256 --> 09:09.542
then the question is, what does
he want from us in return?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.295
Anything he can get
his hands on.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.924
I've just accessed the criminal
ident files from the
Peacekeepers.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.427
It seems our Mr. Staanz has
quite a record.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.564
He came offering help.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.184
Shouldn't we at least give him
the benefit of the doubt?

09:26.275 --> 09:28.266
We don't know that The Flax
doesn't exist.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.520
And what if it does?

09:29.611 --> 09:31.192
He may be leading us
straight into it.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.441
For all we know, he could one
of those bounty hunters.

09:33.532 --> 09:37.150
No, Staanz is trouble, and we
do not need to take that risk,

09:37.244 --> 09:38.529
especially while Moya
is pregnant.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.327
I agree that Staanz may be the
most unusual species,

09:41.415 --> 09:46.125
but you can't surely condemn
him just because he is an
ex-prisoner of the Peacekeepers.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.327
Are you forgetting that we
are all ex-prisoners?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.628
How can I ever forget?

09:49.715 --> 09:51.251
Have you ever looked at
your own records

09:51.341 --> 09:53.798
to see what lies the
Peacekeepers have written
aboutyou?

09:53.886 --> 09:55.717
Have you?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.467
Not everyone imprisoned by the
Peacekeepers was innocent.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.140
Meaning?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.388
Meaning that I do not have
time to stand here and
discuss this with you

10:04.480 --> 10:07.438
while he is looting what
precious little we have.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.131
Interesting move.

10:39.223 --> 10:43.091
Very unconventional.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.346
Care to raise the stakes?

10:47.356 --> 10:50.018
Ossoh scent.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.061
How pure?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.358
Ninety parts.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.482
They won't be able to
resist even you.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.188
( D'argo roars)
( grunts )

10:58.283 --> 10:59.193
What are you doing?!

10:59.284 --> 11:00.273
l was about to raise...

11:00.369 --> 11:01.859
I had him right where
I wanted him.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.696
You have a criminal record
with the Peacekeepers.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.746
Do you have any idea how
difficult that is in this game?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.620
I've got a lot of records with
a lot of people. It's who I am!

11:08.710 --> 11:10.120
It doesn't mean his
money's no good.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.793
...didn't deserve it and I
never robbed anybody...

11:11.880 --> 11:13.620
well, | used to rob anybody but
now I'm an honest garbologist.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.957
Ask anyone. I can give you a
list of names. Well,
a couple of names.

11:17.052 --> 11:17.711
Hey!

11:17.803 --> 11:20.215
( groans )

11:20.305 --> 11:22.045
| used to be a Zenetan.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.176
One of the pirates who
run The Flax.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.008
| alert ships that get
caught in it.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.639
I can prove it.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.938
If you put me down.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.153
Thank you.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.401
Slowly.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.368
Oh, for heaven's sake.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.461
Zenetan gang murals.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.712
I spent nine cycles in a
Malsonic labor stockade.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.464
My Zenetan "brothers"
did nothing to help me.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.261
In fact, 'cause of what they
were doing on the outside,

12:03.348 --> 12:06.010
I got beat close to death more
than once on the inside.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.513
So, uh... when I got out,
I went my own way.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.310
I work for myself now.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.854
Part of the fun is getting to
The Flax before they do.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.397
Also, I like warning people
like you.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.224
Pisses the Zenetans off no end.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.153
And I... I figured when you
send me on my way,

12:19.239 --> 12:23.357
you might give me, I don't
know, a small reward?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.118
Put those back on.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.456
Rygel:
Where are your, uh...

12:28.540 --> 12:30.781
your, uh... your...

12:30.876 --> 12:32.207
My, uh...

12:32.294 --> 12:36.128
For an anthropoid biped there
seems to be something missing.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.124
( chuckles )

12:37.215 --> 12:39.080
Yeah, I know.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.212
Well, I'm a Yenen by species.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.634
We're not exactly, uh...

12:42.721 --> 12:45.133
cut from the standard mold.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.383
If you are truly interested
in helping us,

12:49.478 --> 12:51.218
our transport pod is
still out there.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.929
Two of our complement are
aboard, and we've lost contact.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.889
They're not family?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.224
No.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.184
Good.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.736
There's nothing worse than
losing family.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.157
Right, get a move on, Crichton.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.118
The Message Buoy's almost ready
so we'll need power to
launch it.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.876
I'm working as fast as I can,
Aeryn, but these schematics
are hard to read.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.299
They're like half CAT scan,
half blueprint.

13:22.386 --> 13:23.296
I know you don't
read 'em at all.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.218
Don't be ridiculous.
That's Tech work.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.138
What happens if you crash land
your Prowler and you have
to repair it?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.510
We're not trained to repair.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.307
We're trained to find and
secure somebody else's ship.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.353
Secure. As in take by force.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.647
Oh, beats learning to
read those.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.941
Not today it doesn't.

13:42.114 --> 13:47.450
I think I've redirected the
remaining power from the
auxiliary systems.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.914
Message buoy away.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.333
You ready to go home?

13:56.420 --> 13:57.580
Very.

14:00.048 --> 14:00.878
D'argo:
Staanz.

14:00.966 --> 14:01.796
Staanz:
Huh?!

14:01.883 --> 14:03.214
Where did you get those boots?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.678
Let me go!

14:05.762 --> 14:07.298
Those boots are Luxan.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.222
A Luxan would never lose his
boots unless he were dead.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.969
|didn't kill him.
He was already dead!

14:12.060 --> 14:13.345
His ship got caught
in The Flax!

14:13.437 --> 14:14.768
Oh, so you rob the dead?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.061
No, no...

14:16.148 --> 14:17.354
A Zenetan killed him.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.851
He ejected...

14:18.942 --> 14:21.274
ejected the body.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.773
I tried to get aboard the ship,
but... look.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.445
They blasted the crank
out of me.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.318
You tried to loot a dead
Luxan ship.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.774
Of course I did.
That's what I do. I loot ships.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.234
I see a ship, I try
and loot it.

14:30.328 --> 14:35.197
Well that ship, my friend, was
a Luxan deep-space voyager.

14:35.292 --> 14:39.786
Now, it may have onboard
some map fibers that I
desperately need.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.587
Can you take me there?

14:42.674 --> 14:46.462
Well, I don't know. It was,
uh... earmarked for
destruction.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.509
They might have already...

14:48.597 --> 14:50.212
melted it down.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.761
If you take me there,

14:53.852 --> 14:57.720
everything on board after
I get those map fibers...

14:57.814 --> 14:59.725
is yours.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.483
Well, that sounds like
a deal to me.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.151
What about The Flax?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.523
Oh, not a problem.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.027
If you know what you're doing.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.403
( lock beeping )

15:16.291 --> 15:17.747
( nervous chuckle)

15:20.462 --> 15:22.453
(relieved sigh )

15:25.092 --> 15:27.458
Crichton:
Let's do this while we still
have power.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.294
200 trads. Are we clear?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.595
Not yet. I'm increasing to
eighty percent.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.344
This is going to hurt,
isn't it?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.811
300 trads.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.098
Should I punch it?

15:39.189 --> 15:40.099
Ninety percent.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.225
Should I punch it?

15:41.316 --> 15:42.305
Not yet.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.107
400 trads!

15:48.198 --> 15:49.358
Now?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.280
It's too strong!
I can't hold her!

15:51.368 --> 15:52.574
Now, Aeryn! Now!

15:52.661 --> 15:54.322
500 trads clear!

15:54.412 --> 15:56.198
-Now?!
-Wait!

15:56.289 --> 15:58.120
Man, this is really
going to hurt!

15:58.208 --> 15:59.448
Now!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.039
(yells)

16:04.131 --> 16:05.837
(grunts)

16:05.924 --> 16:07.209
(grunts)

16:09.970 --> 16:11.210
Crichton!

16:11.304 --> 16:12.840
Aeryn, where are you?

16:12.931 --> 16:15.764
I haven't the faintest idea.

16:17.269 --> 16:20.102
Aw, man, I knew this
was going to hurt.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.224
I'll be all right if
I can get it out.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.930
Can you pass me that ax?

16:24.025 --> 16:25.435
Yeah.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.437
What are you going to
do with it?

16:30.532 --> 16:31.442
I'm going to hack my foot off.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.239
Aw, no. Let me, then.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.577
Oh, just give it to me.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.946
Did we break free?

16:36.037 --> 16:37.538
Uh, you mind if! check
in a minute?

16:37.622 --> 16:40.034
I want to get these
flames out first.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.248
D'argo, the distress buoy is
broadcasting full coordinates.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.295
Aeryn's message is short,
but it's clear.

16:48.383 --> 16:52.467
Their pod is caught in some
sort of stasis, but they
see no stars.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.215
Staanz:
That's The Flax, all right.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.969
We are aboard Staanz's vessel
now and ready to launch.
Wish us luck.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.435
Rha'nalan be with you.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.259
A triple quadra-hent.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.685
Of course that means
nothing to you,

17:02.772 --> 17:05.263
but I would have won all this
fair and square,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.735
even if he hadn't left
it behind.

17:17.621 --> 17:20.909
Staanz:
Luxan voyager, here we come!

17:25.295 --> 17:28.287
When I get her really firing
I can get this baby up
to Hatch 4!

17:28.381 --> 17:29.370
It stinks in here.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.125
What?!

17:30.217 --> 17:31.582
It stinks!

17:31.676 --> 17:34.213
Oh, does it? I had my
smell pods cauterized.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.044
Helps in my line of work.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.175
You mean you actually go out
of your way to collect all
these things?

17:38.266 --> 17:41.178
I follow space streams and I
pick up what others throw away.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.509
That's all garbage.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.390
Garbage? I don't touch garbage.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.971
I'm a professional scavenger.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.648
I only pick up the gems of
what others throw away.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.523
I've got 9 million Onnyxi
play partners.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.650
They particalize, they
levitate, everything.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.858
One day, I'm going to sell
these babies and make
a killing.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.286
They burn good, too.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.535
You say that you can take me
to this Luxan ship.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.584
Unless it's already been
melted down.

18:08.672 --> 18:13.132
You and me go onboard, get what
we need, stay no longer
than an arn.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.584
And then we go to rescue
Aeryn and Crichton.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.169
You said they'll be safe
for a while.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.346
They're stuck in The Flax.
They're going nowheres.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.390
You said it was a small pod.
The Zenetans aren't going to
be in a rush to get there.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.388
Oh, we have plenty of time.

18:24.479 --> 18:27.221
Okay. Come on, baby!

18:27.315 --> 18:28.896
Come on!

18:33.154 --> 18:34.360
We're not moving.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.153
We're still stuck.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.482
There must be some sort of
field holding us in place.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.407
You mean like a natural
phenomenon?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.326
You ever hear of phenomenon
like that?

18:42.414 --> 18:43.824
Uh-uh.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.996
Well, whatever it is we have to
find a way to break free.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.041
Any suggestions?

18:54.384 --> 18:58.218
The distress buoy got away.

18:58.305 --> 19:03.140
Well, I guess we just wait
for D'argo and the others
to come rescue us.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.767
-|'|| deal with propulsion.
-|'|| take environmentals.

19:09.316 --> 19:13.275
Go on! Have a chew!
It's delicious!

19:13.361 --> 19:16.103
No, not that bit. It's got to
rot a bit more. Here. Try this.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.403
No. I think I'll pass.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.028
Hang on! If! don't get to
this, she's going to blow!

19:21.119 --> 19:22.279
What?

19:22.370 --> 19:23.359
Come on, baby!

19:23.455 --> 19:25.116
Why don't you just
get it fixed?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.913
I did fix it. That's why it
works when I whack it
a few times.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.116
Help me!

19:29.210 --> 19:30.586
(burbling noise)

19:30.670 --> 19:32.080
Uh-oh.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.662
What?

19:33.757 --> 19:35.293
Hang on.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.211
You see that?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.797
That's Kcrackic's tracer beam.

19:43.892 --> 19:44.972
Who's Kcrackic?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.891
He's the Red Mentor to
the Zenetans.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.479
Is that like a rank?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.975
There's nothing military about
these guys except their
firepower.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.931
Then why are you so
afraid of him?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.357
I'm not afraid, exactly.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.685
It's just... maybe I
should have...

19:56.780 --> 19:57.986
mentioned it earlier, but...

19:58.073 --> 20:00.405
I'm kind of on Kcrackic's
hate list.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.199
I told a few of his secrets
to get out of prison.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.447
So you betrayed your
own leader?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.244
Betray? Never.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.823
The bottom line is, if he knows
we're around he's going to
seal The Flax up

20:09.918 --> 20:12.955
and we're not going to get to
the Luxan ship or your friends.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.250
He missed us.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.301
But he's headed straight
for your ship.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.799
The Moya!

20:23.890 --> 20:27.132
Warn them. They've never heard
of me, they've never seen me.

20:27.227 --> 20:31.345
I understand, D'argo. We will
strive to keep them distracted
as long as we can.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.271
Ooh...

20:37.362 --> 20:40.399
I will strive to keep
them distracted.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.321
(belching)

20:50.208 --> 20:52.449
Greetings. I am Pa'u
Zotoh Zhaan.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.909
You are Kcrackic?

20:54.003 --> 20:55.209
You know me?

20:55.296 --> 20:56.547
Your reputation is well
known in these parts.

20:56.631 --> 20:57.541
For what?

20:57.632 --> 20:58.712
Cruelty.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.291
My scan shows that your
Leviathan is pregnant.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.796
-You're lucky.
-Why?

21:02.887 --> 21:05.469
I once tried to commandeer
a pregnant Leviathan.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.218
80 men died.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.720
A mother will protect
her child.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.473
A tracer ship was last seen
heading in this direction.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.475
Run by a pewnkah named Staanz.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.602
Have you seen it? Or him?

21:16.693 --> 21:19.810
No. Perhaps I can offer you and
your men something to eat?

21:19.904 --> 21:22.771
You offer us nothing. What we
want from your ship, we take.

21:22.866 --> 21:25.403
I see nothing of value here.
Let's go.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.733
Commander Kcrackic...

21:26.828 --> 21:29.160
May I present Rygel the
Sixteenth, Dominar of...

21:29.247 --> 21:30.908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.536
How do you do, pleased to meet
you and all that yotz.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.414
Where did you get so many
Kelvic Crystals, little one?

21:38.214 --> 21:39.294
I won them.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.588
Playing Tadek?

21:40.675 --> 21:44.088
No. Inter-species tugg
wrestling, idiot.

21:46.848 --> 21:50.306
So, you believe you play well?

22:08.161 --> 22:10.197
I'm still not getting
a clean reading.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.872
More than half the pod's sensor
relays have been fried.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.792
Do you think Moya's got
that distress buoy yet?

22:17.879 --> 22:19.995
Crichton:
Don't know, but even
if she did,

22:20.089 --> 22:24.378
if we don't buy ourselves a
couple of hours, arns,

22:24.469 --> 22:27.131
we'll be dead by the time
anybody gets here.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.180
The atmospherics mix line
is crushed.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.517
Can you fix it?

22:31.601 --> 22:32.932
Maybe.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.180
Might be able to weld it, but
I need a welding torch.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.478
There should be one in the
equipment pack.

22:42.445 --> 22:47.985
Problem is, there's too much
pure 02 in here right now to
risk firing it up.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.818
What if we depressurize,
blast it out into space?

22:50.912 --> 22:52.948
Fix it in our suits?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.245
Yeah.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.288
Aeryn, that's a great idea.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.166
You sound surprised.

22:59.254 --> 23:00.539
( explosion )

23:05.426 --> 23:06.336
You okay?

23:06.427 --> 23:07.507
Yes. You?

23:07.595 --> 23:10.428
Yeah, just... peachy.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.343
Are you comfortable?

23:13.434 --> 23:15.390
Can I get you a pillow?

23:30.201 --> 23:32.578
Do you think your people have
kept Kcrackic occupied?

23:32.662 --> 23:34.744
Well, why don't we just call
Moya and ask them?

23:34.831 --> 23:37.117
Perhaps you can speak
to Kcrackic himself.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.823
Let's get out of here.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.034
Kcrackic isn't the kind of
person you give a second
chance to find you.

23:41.129 --> 23:44.087
Okay, come on. Sing for
daddy. Sing!

23:44.173 --> 23:45.128
(engine dies)

23:45.216 --> 23:46.797
What's wrong?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.796
Oh, nothing, nothing. Sometimes
she just needs a bit of a push
to get going.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.263
A push?

23:51.347 --> 23:54.430
Yeah, you know. like a grav
spin around a planet
or something?

23:56.436 --> 23:59.769
I need you to get me to
that ship fast so I can
find that map fiber.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.142
If you want to get there,
open the furnace.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.348
Hmm?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.229
This had better work.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.613
Come on! Burn!

24:15.663 --> 24:16.994
Come on!

24:17.081 --> 24:20.369
Burn, baby, burn!

24:20.460 --> 24:21.870
Okay...

24:22.295 --> 24:24.160
Here we go.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.881
Oh, great!

24:36.976 --> 24:38.261
What's wrong?

24:38.353 --> 24:40.844
We're caught in The Flax.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.192
Impressive.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.957
We'll be out of here in
a few microts.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.254
Mmm.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.803
Rygel, surely you're not
giving up so early...

25:12.887 --> 25:14.002
Who's giving up?

25:14.097 --> 25:15.337
I'm not giving up.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.171
Leave me alone.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.427
I know what I'm doing.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.602
Ante up, Hynerian.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.231
It's going to be like a wind
tunnel in here when we
depressurize.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.358
I'll get the release sequence
started and leave ou
tthe last line...

25:33.449 --> 25:36.156
We have a problem.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.109
What's the matter?

25:39.330 --> 25:40.991
It's broken.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.788
Is there another one of those?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.036
Exactly that.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.873
One.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.956
So one of us gets to die.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.884
Crichton:
Torch looks like it's in
working condition.

26:03.980 --> 26:09.225
Unfortunately, there's no way
to test it before we
depressurize.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.731
Kill shot. We use them in
battle triage to stop brain
and heart function.

26:12.822 --> 26:16.280
And this is a nerve shot.
You use this one to
bring me back.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.234
Whoa, whoa, hold the phone.
Let's talk about this.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.408
Nothing to talk about.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.906
You know welding.
You should do the repairs.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.158
Yeah, but Aeryn, that means
you've gotta...

26:23.249 --> 26:24.910
I'm Sebacean. They are meant
to be used on my kind.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.537
Yeah, but still...

26:26.627 --> 26:29.369
The oxygen is rising in here
quickly so you'd better
get ready.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.422
Aeryn,

26:38.514 --> 26:40.470
you notice anything about that?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.007
It's useless.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.842
It's also mine.

26:46.731 --> 26:49.393
Yours isn't going to fit me.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.413
Tell me exactly what
I have to do.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.536
We could wait. The others
may come.

27:08.628 --> 27:13.167
No. We got to fix the line.
Otherwise, we're both dead
anyway.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.794
And if we get another
spot fire in this place,

27:15.885 --> 27:18.171
it's going to go up like
a blast furnace.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.344
How long do I have to
do the repairs?

27:20.431 --> 27:25.642
I don't know. Um, without
oxygen, my brain can last
maybe four minutes,

27:25.728 --> 27:27.229
maybe five or six depending
on my body temperature.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.895
Pick a number.
Tell me how long I have,
and I'll follow it

27:29.982 --> 27:32.940
but tell me what to do while
there's still time.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.318
Torch.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.201
(gasping)

27:52.296 --> 27:55.288
( laughing )

27:55.383 --> 27:58.125
Goon:
Should I tell Bacca to
fire up the engines?

27:58.219 --> 28:01.882
Why not? I should be
there shortly.

28:05.476 --> 28:06.977
Hmm?

28:19.323 --> 28:22.065
Very unusual move.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.195
Where did you learn it?

28:24.287 --> 28:27.370
Uh, I made it up myself.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.489
Did you?

28:29.584 --> 28:32.417
I know somebody else who
makes that move.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.915
Good for you.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.129
(sighing)

28:45.224 --> 28:46.464
Are you sure this thing's
going to work?

28:46.559 --> 28:47.924
Mm-hmm, it should kill you.

28:48.019 --> 28:50.556
Well, it's not the kill shot
that concerns me.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.353
I'm sure you guys got that
one down fine.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.227
It's the wake-up call that's
got me worried.

28:55.318 --> 28:58.310
Well, we can't be sure it works
until you're dead.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.519
Great.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.400
It works perfectly well
on Sebaceans

29:01.490 --> 29:05.733
and Sebacean and human
physiology appears to be
similar enough, so I say 50-50.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.614
You call that good odds?

29:07.705 --> 29:11.323
No. No, no, no. I'm going
to teach you CPR.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.953
What's that?

29:13.044 --> 29:15.285
It's a human resuscitation
technique and very low tech.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.755
We don't have time for this.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.376
Aeryn, I've got time, okay?

29:19.467 --> 29:23.380
I need a backup plan in case
your little nerve shot
doesn't work, Aeryn.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.219
What does it involve?

29:26.307 --> 29:29.925
It involves you breathing for
me, keeping my blood flowing
so I don't die.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.260
Don't be ridiculous. It sounds
far too complicated.

29:32.355 --> 29:36.143
Well, it's a lot less
complicated than learning
to fly 3 Transport Pod.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.565
Fine. Show it to me, then.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.018
Good. Lie down.

29:40.112 --> 29:40.612
What?

29:40.655 --> 29:43.237
Lie down.

29:43.324 --> 29:46.737
No, flat out on the ground.
I can't show... lie down.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.699
Okay.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.367
Come on!

29:56.462 --> 29:58.373
( laughing )

30:01.258 --> 30:02.919
Where are the stars?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.467
The Flax magna absorbs the
light before it can get to us.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.634
It's a bummer, like that.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.303
Absorbs the light?

30:08.391 --> 30:11.224
If it's that powerful, how come
you're not more concerned?

30:11.310 --> 30:15.269
Because I may be able to
dissolve a small part
of The Flax

30:15.356 --> 30:17.187
unless they've already
changed the code.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.059
What?

30:18.150 --> 30:19.856
Now, what I need from you is,

30:19.944 --> 30:23.186
I need you to whack this
really hard on my signal.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.362
Whack it really hard. Ready?

30:26.575 --> 30:28.236
Three...

30:29.120 --> 30:30.485
Two...

30:31.497 --> 30:33.408
One...

30:33.499 --> 30:34.739
Whack it!

30:34.834 --> 30:36.244
(grunting)

30:36.335 --> 30:38.291
Come on, man! Come on!

30:38.379 --> 30:40.165
(grunting)

30:40.256 --> 30:42.042
You can do it, come on.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.545
Just a bit. Come on. Come on!

30:45.636 --> 30:48.343
(grunting)

30:56.022 --> 30:58.308
Yes! We've done it!

30:59.066 --> 31:00.306
We're clear of The Flax!

31:00.401 --> 31:01.436
We're clear!

31:01.527 --> 31:03.108
Did I say it, huh?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.810
Hey! Stop whacking it!

31:04.905 --> 31:06.941
We're clear! We've made it!

31:07.033 --> 31:08.364
( laughing )

31:09.326 --> 31:11.817
Oh! Go with me, brother!

31:13.289 --> 31:15.154
We're clear.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.241
It doesn't get better than
this, baby!

31:19.670 --> 31:21.752
13,14,15.

31:21.839 --> 31:25.081
Then two more breaths then
15 more compressions.

31:25.176 --> 31:28.168
Right, until I start breathing
again on my own.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.627
Or not.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.262
Let's do it.

31:32.349 --> 31:37.184
You've got about four minutes,
180 microts before my brain
starts to go adios.

31:40.316 --> 31:42.352
Aeryn, it's real simple what
you got to do to fix the line.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.809
I remember what you told me.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.613
Hey, when Sebaceans die what do
you guys believe happens?

31:48.699 --> 31:51.406
Do you believe in an afterlife?
Heaven and Hell, all thatjazz?

31:51.494 --> 31:57.034
Humans believe, well some
believe that there's like
this bright light

31:57.124 --> 32:00.833
and you end up somewhere else
along with your friends,

32:00.920 --> 32:05.710
family, relatives, all the
people who died before you.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.249
Does that ring a bell?

32:09.345 --> 32:11.336
Sebaceans believe when
you die you die.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.466
You go nowhere; you
see nothing.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.422
Guess I'll find out in
a minute, huh?

32:16.477 --> 32:19.059
-Okay, 180 microts.
-Yes, I know.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.602
Sorry if I'm repeating myself.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.305
It's just, you know, I don't
want to take any chances
with this, so...

32:23.400 --> 32:25.015
I won't let you down, John.

32:27.488 --> 32:30.104
Aw, this... this is going to
hurt like crap, isn't it?

32:30.199 --> 32:32.611
Trust me, it's not going
to hurt a bit.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.242
That's it?

32:48.717 --> 32:49.672
Well, it doesn't hurt...

32:49.760 --> 32:51.261
( screaming )

33:17.204 --> 33:20.162
The engine's fired up,
ready to go.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.245
Your wager, your Lordship.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.418
Zhaan:
But we have nothing
left to bet.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.370
This ship.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.592
I'll wager this ship.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.882
You can't do that, Rygel.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.550
I can beat him. I know I can.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.343
Fear not, lovely lady.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.638
I told you before, I've had my
experience with pregnant
Leviathans.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.431
I don't want your ship.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.850
I reject your wager.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.679
Quit now. You must quit.

33:46.567 --> 33:49.309
The one you call Staanz.
I know where he is.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.153
Rygel!

33:50.237 --> 33:51.773
I wager his whereabouts.

33:57.369 --> 34:03.160
Computer:
You now have 60 microts, 59, 58

34:03.250 --> 34:08.586
57, 56, 55

34:08.672 --> 34:12.585
54, 53...

34:12.676 --> 34:15.588
Hey, I'm picking up some
traces of atmosphere.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.795
Atmosphere?

34:17.890 --> 34:19.221
Yeah. They're drifting from
the coordinates where

34:19.308 --> 34:21.173
your ship's pod is caught
in The Flax.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.759
Oh, they're not just mere
traces, either.

34:23.854 --> 34:26.095
Looks like your friends might
be out of luck.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.806
We may have no reason to rush
aboard that Luxan ship.

34:36.158 --> 34:41.152
Computer:
14, 13,12...

34:41.247 --> 34:45.490
11, 10,9...

34:46.543 --> 34:51.128
8, 7, 6...

34:52.091 --> 34:58.087
5, 4, 3, 2...

34:58.180 --> 34:59.340
1...

34:59.431 --> 35:00.386
(groaning)

35:00.474 --> 35:02.180
Time has lapsed.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.510
Time has lapsed. Time has...

35:22.621 --> 35:25.704
( laughing ):
I knew it. I knew
I could do it.

35:26.709 --> 35:27.869
Thanks for the game.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.372
The game's not over.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.840
Thank you for the game...

35:40.931 --> 35:42.262
little one.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.305
( laughing )

35:46.270 --> 35:49.262
Now, for that nugget of
information you promised me.

35:49.356 --> 35:50.186
Zhaan:
Rygel, don't.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.230
Oh, you will tell me

35:52.318 --> 35:54.900
or he'll blow your brains out.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.440
I'll count to three.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.151
One...

36:00.242 --> 36:02.654
Two...

36:02.745 --> 36:04.281
-Three.
-Okay.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.236
Staanz was here.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.243
One of our crew is
with him now.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.667
You can locate him by following
the frequency of our crew
member's comms unit.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.540
What's the frequency?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.631
It's in the ship's data store.

36:17.718 --> 36:21.427
Access the ship's data stores
and let's go get him.

36:45.371 --> 36:46.611
Crichton.

36:58.801 --> 37:00.883
One... two...

37:00.969 --> 37:03.051
three... four.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.094
Come on, Crichton, wake up.

37:05.182 --> 37:09.300
Seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven,

37:09.395 --> 37:12.228
twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

37:24.535 --> 37:27.368
Aeryn and Crichton have
a second reserve tank.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.830
They could still be alive.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.779
Look, there she is.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.160
Your Luxan beauty.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.458
Oh, you're lucky, we're
just in time.

37:42.553 --> 37:45.260
She's next in line for
the melt.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.963
It's a Luxan Assault Piercer.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.595
I dreamt of serving on
one as a boy.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.768
I'll bring her in
nice and easy.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.395
Come on!

38:03.240 --> 38:05.196
What are you looking
so down about?

38:05.284 --> 38:08.151
You said yourself the two
aboard that pod weren't family.

38:10.414 --> 38:13.281
Look, the maps aboard that ship
might be your only chance

38:13.375 --> 38:15.707
to reunite with your real
family, huh?

38:17.713 --> 38:18.577
My son.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.287
Yeah, yeah, your son.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.258
Thirteen, fourteen, come on!

38:32.561 --> 38:34.142
Come on!

38:40.360 --> 38:41.611
(gasps )

38:41.695 --> 38:43.105
Crichton.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.404
My God.

38:51.622 --> 38:56.036
You did it, Aeryn. You did it.

38:56.126 --> 38:58.208
But you lied like a dog.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.411
God, that hurt like hell.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.838
How'd it go?

39:03.926 --> 39:06.167
The environmentals. They fixed?

39:06.261 --> 39:09.003
Uh, |... I didn't finish.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.595
You didn't what?

39:10.682 --> 39:13.515
Your time was running out.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.138
Wait a minute.
You stopped because...

39:15.229 --> 39:18.767
I think we have about half
an am of breathable
atmosphere left.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.788
I thought we'd never be
rid of them.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.328
You wanted them to leave.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.120
Didn't you?

39:36.208 --> 39:37.243
Yes, but I...

39:37.334 --> 39:39.165
You didn't expect them to
leave us unscathed

39:39.253 --> 39:41.414
unless they thought they were
leaving with something of
value, did you?

39:41.505 --> 39:43.166
You gave them the frequency.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.248
The wrong frequency, yes.

39:45.342 --> 39:49.301
I told Pilot to change it the
minute Kcrackic stepped
on board.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.719
Where are they headed, Pilot?

39:50.806 --> 39:53.138
Not exactly certain.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.510
I could plot it for you.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.513
No, don't bother.
As long as it's far from here.

39:57.604 --> 40:01.142
Oh. It's certainly that.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.269
You lost to Kcrackic
on purpose?

40:03.360 --> 40:04.600
You think it was easy?

40:04.695 --> 40:06.231
He's an abominable player.

40:06.321 --> 40:10.030
A switched-off DRD would have
made a better showing
for itself.

40:10.117 --> 40:11.323
Oh, please.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.822
Bluffing is what the
game's all about.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.712
The message buoy got out.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.040
They could still come for us.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.175
Maybe they've been trying
all this time.

40:31.263 --> 40:36.178
The phenomenon that's got
hold of us might not be
letting them through.

40:36.268 --> 40:39.601
They might have tried and
given up already.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.648
Oh...

40:44.735 --> 40:48.023
It's really cold in here.

40:52.701 --> 40:55.488
It's colder than a frog's ass.

41:14.014 --> 41:15.504
Okay.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.135
We're docking.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.343
If I get this right, we'll be
nice and snug in the
aft access port.

41:22.439 --> 41:24.304
Oh, come on, you got to
be a bit excited.

41:24.399 --> 41:28.187
You're 15 paces away from your
own Luxan Assault Piercer.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.071
The maps.

41:30.155 --> 41:33.192
You'll be able to
find your son.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.365
You got to be looking forward
to seeing your son.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.567
Huh?

41:43.085 --> 41:44.370
Yes.

41:44.461 --> 41:47.749
But when I do, I want to be
able to look him in the eye.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.426
Aeryn.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.892
You should have kept working.
Finished the repair.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.970
At least one of us would
have survived.

42:05.065 --> 42:07.226
To be sitting here alone now?

42:08.235 --> 42:11.102
I chose not to.

42:11.196 --> 42:16.111
I thought Peacekeepers were
trained to fight alone,
survive alone.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.775
Die alone.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.245
Well...

42:19.329 --> 42:22.696
it appears my training is
failing me.

42:22.791 --> 42:25.203
I don't want to die alone.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.334
What did you see?

42:31.425 --> 42:32.710
Hmm?

42:32.801 --> 42:35.759
Y-you know, after the kill
shot, when you were dead.

42:35.846 --> 42:39.714
Did you see the things that,
you know that, that
humans believe?

42:39.808 --> 42:41.890
The light? Friends?

42:41.977 --> 42:43.387
No.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.855
No, I didn't.

42:45.939 --> 42:48.351
All I saw was black.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.021
I don't know, maybe you
Sebaceans are right.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.352
Maybe there's nothing
after this.

42:53.447 --> 42:54.857
Maybe...

42:56.366 --> 42:59.108
maybe...

42:59.202 --> 43:01.693
I wasn't supposed to die
that time.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.705
Well...

43:05.792 --> 43:08.579
maybe you'll find out for
certain this time.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.752
Somebody docking?

44:05.936 --> 44:08.018
D'argo.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.605
(clearing throat)

44:10.315 --> 44:12.021
Um...

44:12.108 --> 44:13.609
what took you so long?

44:13.693 --> 44:16.150
I had to, uh...

44:16.238 --> 44:18.399
find someone to help me.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.314
Right.

44:23.954 --> 44:26.491
I think it's time that we left.

44:35.298 --> 44:38.165
It's about time!

44:38.260 --> 44:40.125
Oh, your pals are okay!
I told you they would be!

44:40.220 --> 44:43.257
You think maybe you could
untie me, please?

44:43.348 --> 44:44.758
This is no fun!

44:44.850 --> 44:46.306
Hey, welcome aboard, people!

44:46.393 --> 44:48.179
I'd offer you something
to chew but, uh,

44:48.270 --> 44:50.886
what can I say? My hands
are tied at the moment!

44:50.981 --> 44:53.017
Is he dangerous?

44:53.108 --> 44:54.689
Merely annoying.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.437
The Flax is huge.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.894
There's bound to be another
Luxan ship stuck in there
somewhere.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.854
I thought...

45:00.949 --> 45:04.157
maybe we could go look
for it together?

45:04.244 --> 45:06.075
We go together?
(snons)

45:07.080 --> 45:09.321
I'm lonely.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.325
Everybody needs a mate,
Ka D'argo.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.660
Even you.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.494
A mate?

45:20.093 --> 45:23.176
I am the female of the species.
You know that don't you?

45:23.263 --> 45:27.302
In fact, false modesty
aside I'm, uh...

45:28.768 --> 45:31.384
I'm considered quite the
Zenetan beauty.

45:35.817 --> 45:38.183
You know big guy, I think
I better, uh...

45:38.278 --> 45:40.269
give you a little time
alone here.

45:40.363 --> 45:44.197
'Cause I know, in a universe
this vast when two hearts
collide...

45:44.284 --> 45:45.649
Shut up.

45:46.703 --> 45:48.534
You and me?

46:01.384 --> 46:03.215
Oh, I don't really, ah...

46:03.303 --> 46:04.759
I love you.

46:04.846 --> 46:07.679
Um, well you, ah...

46:07.766 --> 46:09.848
Love you!

46:10.852 --> 46:12.683
I love you!

46:26.284 --> 46:30.448
We are now well out of range of
The Flax and Kcrackic's tracer.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.748
What happened out there,
D'argo?

46:37.587 --> 46:39.327
D'argo?

46:41.257 --> 46:45.796
A Luxan warrior must never
be indecisive in battle.

46:45.887 --> 46:48.754
My indecision nearly cost Aeryn
and Crichton their lives.

46:48.848 --> 46:50.384
But you saved them.

46:50.475 --> 46:51.760
Barely.

46:51.851 --> 46:54.684
And by saving them I may have
given up my only chance

46:54.771 --> 46:56.887
of ever seeing my son again.

46:58.692 --> 47:01.399
On every front,

47:02.237 --> 47:04.319
I failed.

47:24.009 --> 47:26.421
Heat of the moment.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.802
Exactly.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.390
Too much pure oxygen.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.510
Affected ourjudgment.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.683
If it had been you and
D'argo there,

47:35.770 --> 47:38.102
the same thing probably
would have happened.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.770
Or you and Zhaan.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.151
Anyway, one thing's for sure.
It'll never...

47:45.238 --> 47:47.274
never happen again.

47:48.450 --> 47:50.281
Never.
(clearing throat)

47:50.368 --> 47:51.949
Never.

47:52.746 --> 47:54.327
Never.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.078
One thing,

48:03.006 --> 48:06.248
just to be absolutely certain.

48:06.342 --> 48:08.833
You are the female of
your species?

48:08.928 --> 48:10.338
Right?

48:19.731 --> 48:22.222
I'll take that as a yes.
