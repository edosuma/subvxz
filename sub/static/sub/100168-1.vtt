00:35.840 --> 00:36.944
Where are you going, Violet?

00:37.251 --> 00:39.013
Just to pick some flowers.

00:39.379 --> 00:40.956
Don't wander too far.

00:48.009 --> 00:52.979
♪ My wild Irish Rose ♪

00:53.649 --> 00:58.324
♪ The sweetest flower that grows ♪

00:59.061 --> 01:01.790
♪ You may search everywhere ♪

01:02.476 --> 01:10.816
♪ But none can compare
with my wild Irish Rose ♪

01:11.710 --> 01:12.742
Oh, hi there!

01:16.305 --> 01:17.793
Do you want one?

01:27.967 --> 01:30.454
You are wondering
why I'm wearing such a funny hat.

01:31.271 --> 01:33.158
I always wear this hat.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.864
So much, that it's a
part of my name now.

01:36.701 --> 01:40.274
My friends, my very
very best friends.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.949
They just call me
Rose the Hat.

01:43.099 --> 01:45.062
It looks like a magicians hat.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.105
It is.

01:47.815 --> 01:49.505
It's a magic hat.

01:50.339 --> 01:51.494
Do you wanna see?

01:53.202 --> 01:54.855
Nothing up my sleeves.

01:57.722 --> 01:58.866
Nothing in my hat.

02:01.898 --> 02:03.066
Don't worry, that's my friend.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.254
You're missing the trick.

02:04.702 --> 02:05.880
Reach inside.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.763
Wow!
It's so pretty.

02:13.763 --> 02:15.762
Because it's special.

02:15.762 --> 02:17.753
And speaking of special.

02:17.961 --> 02:20.860
You are a little magic too, 
aren't you?

02:22.014 --> 02:24.702
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

02:27.597 --> 02:28.713
Purple.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.602
Violet!
Like you.

02:40.696 --> 02:42.469
You don't eat flowers!

02:42.685 --> 02:44.024
But you do.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.968
But these are special.

02:46.517 --> 02:50.443
Honey, it's the special ones 
that taste best.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.087
I should get back
to my mom.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.612
No, stay, stay a while,
see more magic.

03:03.727 --> 03:06.411
You are a special little thing, 
aren't you?

05:52.784 --> 05:54.305
No, please...

05:58.838 --> 06:01.229
Hey, it's okay, Doc.

06:02.357 --> 06:03.603
It's okay.

06:09.704 --> 06:11.965
There, all dry.

06:15.755 --> 06:16.922
What happened?

06:20.260 --> 06:22.337
You have to talk
to me, Danny.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.660
You haven't talked
since we left...

06:27.559 --> 06:29.070
Please, Doc.

06:31.469 --> 06:32.654
Please.

06:47.069 --> 06:48.658
So...

06:49.007 --> 06:51.396
You ain't talking, huh, Doc?

06:56.053 --> 06:58.445
Weren't talking much
the first time I met you neither.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.114
You remember the first
time we really talked?

07:04.271 --> 07:06.372
When I spoke up
inside your head.

07:07.993 --> 07:09.931
Made you feel good, right?

07:10.207 --> 07:11.917
Knowing you're not alone.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.897
Someone did that for me too.

07:15.805 --> 07:19.610
And someday, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

07:20.179 --> 07:21.297
I won't.

07:22.313 --> 07:23.487
No, you won't, huh?

07:23.487 --> 07:27.263
I won't shine, I mean.
No more, it's dangerous.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.078
Very good it is.
Sometimes.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.440
She found me.

07:32.605 --> 07:35.433
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

07:36.628 --> 07:37.957
You're right.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.719
The Overlook's condemned.

07:39.719 --> 07:44.250
Boarded up, there are starving old
ghosts in there, reaching out for you.

07:44.581 --> 07:46.140
Won't stop with her, either.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.207
Pictures in the book.

07:48.565 --> 07:51.745
You said they were just pictures
in the book, and they couldn't hurt me.

07:54.266 --> 07:58.074
Some things, dark things.

07:58.497 --> 08:00.201
The shining is like food.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.500
The Overlook, it was always
just pictures to me.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.330
But I didn't shine like you.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.617
Nobody shines like you.

08:12.809 --> 08:14.666
So you in that damn hotel,

08:14.795 --> 08:19.027
you were like a million watt battery,
all plugged in.

08:19.027 --> 08:20.516
And it ate it up.

08:23.114 --> 08:25.080
World's a hungry place.

08:26.697 --> 08:30.320
And the darkest things are the hungriest,
and they'll eat what shines.

08:30.482 --> 08:35.594
Swarm in, like mosquitoes, leeches.
Can't do nothing about that.

08:38.232 --> 08:39.962
What you can do

08:41.149 --> 08:44.413
is turn what they come for
against them.

08:47.484 --> 08:49.056
My grandfather.

08:50.383 --> 08:52.413
He was a mean son of a bitch.

08:54.355 --> 08:57.668
Dark inside.
Same type of dark as your dad.

08:58.583 --> 09:03.186
Beat me senseless and my grandma too.
And when he died I danced.

09:03.721 --> 09:05.637
But he came home coming back.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.253
Standing in my room.

09:09.879 --> 09:15.749
Suit all gray and stinking from whatever mold
was growing on him in that box.

09:16.731 --> 09:19.240
So, grandma...

09:21.260 --> 09:23.180
She taught me a trick.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.493
Gave me a prison.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.660
I want you to know this box.

09:33.581 --> 09:35.084
Inside and out.

09:35.727 --> 09:37.667
Don't just look at it, touch it.

09:38.763 --> 09:41.600
Stick your nose inside,
see if there is a smell.

09:42.192 --> 09:42.921
Why?

09:42.921 --> 09:47.193
Because you gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

09:47.494 --> 09:49.321
One even more special.

09:49.784 --> 09:51.808
So next time
that bitch comes around.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.331
You'll be ready.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.721
Let's get you back to mama.

09:58.289 --> 10:00.150
Danny!

10:00.462 --> 10:02.264
Danny!

10:04.112 --> 10:05.591
Danny!

10:06.916 --> 10:08.592
There you are!

10:08.926 --> 10:11.081
Where did you go?!

10:12.725 --> 10:15.025
You scared me half to death.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.659
Don't you do that to me,
you hear?

10:19.364 --> 10:21.575
Don't you ever do this to me.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.788
Don't ever do this to me.

10:31.202 --> 10:33.374
What's up, Doc?

10:36.447 --> 10:37.720
<i> What's cooking? </i>

10:38.806 --> 10:42.011
<i> What's cooking little friend?
Well, you are! </i>

10:42.193 --> 10:42.946
<i> Me? </i>

10:43.119 --> 10:44.591
<i> Yes. </i>

10:48.053 --> 10:50.626
Ouch, you are killing me!

11:49.402 --> 11:50.821
You okay, Doc?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.752
Yeah, Mom, I'm okay.

12:24.893 --> 12:26.686
- What's your name again, cutie?
- Dan.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.665
Dan.

13:04.223 --> 13:08.614
You gonna take that medicine.

13:08.832 --> 13:10.782
Come on. Get out.

13:11.506 --> 13:13.285
Shit, I think you killed him.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.916
What if you killed him?

13:16.081 --> 13:17.306
I hope you killed him.

13:17.645 --> 13:18.823
You hear me?

13:20.915 --> 13:22.192
Let me kiss it won't hurt.

13:31.818 --> 13:33.401
No, no, no.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.126
No, no.

13:36.308 --> 13:39.575
What a...

14:03.569 --> 14:05.374
Mommy?

14:14.167 --> 14:16.233
- Mommy?
- Baby.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.439
Here, here.

14:24.903 --> 14:27.164
You can put 
her money back, Doc.

14:27.848 --> 14:29.489
You can do that much.

14:30.185 --> 14:31.693
She took mine.

14:32.212 --> 14:34.023
She probably bought
a coke with it.

14:35.431 --> 14:36.813
Doc!

15:14.956 --> 15:15.982
Andi?

15:17.183 --> 15:18.471
That's right.

15:20.705 --> 15:22.705
You're prettier than your picture.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.774
And you're older than yours.

15:29.138 --> 15:32.039
We're staying here,
or going somewhere?

15:35.544 --> 15:37.459
Don't you wanna watch the movie?

15:50.548 --> 15:52.312
I don't see what the fuss is about.

15:52.312 --> 15:56.063
Chat-room romance,
little girls, not interesting.

15:56.234 --> 15:59.370
Just watch,
see if there's thing I promised.

15:59.370 --> 16:02.447
It better be,
'cause she's not all that steamy.

16:02.602 --> 16:04.557
There she goes.

16:05.217 --> 16:07.272
Aren't you tired?

16:08.524 --> 16:10.235
Sleep.

16:21.384 --> 16:23.321
Okay.

16:29.772 --> 16:32.161
Wait. This is the best part.

16:32.716 --> 16:35.777
I watched her do it 3 times now,
and it never gets old.

16:37.022 --> 16:40.149
Sleep deeper.
Deep as you can.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.099
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

16:47.771 --> 16:53.336
You can explain a lost wallet,
when your wife asks.

16:54.490 --> 16:57.113
But you can't explain this?

16:58.069 --> 17:02.151
This you'll see every day
when you look in the mirror.

17:03.107 --> 17:07.695
And at every time you see it,
you'll say out loud -

17:09.490 --> 17:11.998
"I like little girls".

17:13.859 --> 17:18.704
And the next time you go looking
for a little girl online.

17:19.220 --> 17:21.798
I want you to remember

17:21.798 --> 17:25.685
that time you got bitten 
by a rattle snake.

17:33.797 --> 17:35.217
That is interesting.

17:45.145 --> 17:46.459
Excuse me, Miss?

17:47.336 --> 17:48.556
Miss?

17:48.687 --> 17:50.174
Miss, you left something
in the theater.

17:50.174 --> 17:52.040
You wanna leave me alone.

17:58.352 --> 18:00.797
Well, hi there.

18:02.205 --> 18:03.951
You wanna let me go.

18:05.154 --> 18:07.278
Oh, no sweetie.

18:08.229 --> 18:09.590
No, I don't.

18:59.247 --> 19:02.211
Mommy, I made this for you,
it's a secret card.

19:02.688 --> 19:03.824
Thank you, Abadoo.

19:03.824 --> 19:06.430
Does anyone know a magic word?

19:09.045 --> 19:09.791
You.

19:10.593 --> 19:11.725
Abracadabra.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.721
"Abracadabra", that's a great one.

19:13.898 --> 19:14.556
One.

19:14.863 --> 19:15.657
Two.

19:15.846 --> 19:16.570
Three.

19:16.753 --> 19:18.926
Abracadabra!

19:20.425 --> 19:22.088
I know magic too.

19:22.199 --> 19:23.837
Sometimes...

19:24.843 --> 19:26.003
Sorry.

19:27.874 --> 19:29.116
Has anyone seen my spoons?

19:29.826 --> 19:31.292
I can do that.

19:31.429 --> 19:32.412
That's nice, sweetie.

19:32.412 --> 19:34.136
- They are on you!
- Oh, they are on me?

19:40.134 --> 19:41.827
What the hell?

19:50.517 --> 19:52.514
Dave.

20:04.743 --> 20:06.660
Abracadabra.

20:43.627 --> 20:44.658
Oops.

20:44.798 --> 20:46.331
Oh, hi there sleepy-head.

20:47.003 --> 20:48.275
Sorry.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.648
I had to sleep you 
pretty hard.

20:50.966 --> 20:52.617
You are a tough one.

20:53.021 --> 20:54.170
Willful.

20:54.536 --> 20:55.789
You know I checked.

20:56.269 --> 21:01.504
Six men in 3 months with those
little snake bite tattoos on their cheeks?

21:02.276 --> 21:04.065
My, you've been busy.

21:10.385 --> 21:13.543
Snakebite Andi - that's who you are.

21:14.590 --> 21:16.590
So, who am I?

21:19.033 --> 21:21.433
You're some crazy bitch,
who kidnapped me.

21:22.136 --> 21:23.679
Just the truth from now on.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.987
You will only speak the truth.

21:28.796 --> 21:31.857
You're the most beautiful woman 
I've ever seen.

21:32.855 --> 21:35.070
Oh my God, works a little 
too well, doesn't it?

21:35.910 --> 21:38.688
Here's the deal
Snakebite Andi.

21:38.942 --> 21:41.918
You are pusher, hm?
You can push people.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.859
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while.

21:44.859 --> 21:49.650
So, I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

21:51.339 --> 21:53.193
How old are you, darling?

21:54.860 --> 21:56.197
Fifteen.

21:56.431 --> 21:57.780
Fifteen?

21:58.335 --> 22:00.228
Oh, God, what an age.

22:01.460 --> 22:04.245
Springtime of your womanhood, 
isn't it?

22:05.948 --> 22:10.527
You are not a girl anymore 
but you don't have a single dent yet either.

22:11.383 --> 22:13.891
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

22:14.378 --> 22:16.184
Not in 15.

22:17.610 --> 22:18.782
Men though...

22:20.354 --> 22:22.126
No, no. no. No shame.

22:23.284 --> 22:26.665
You paid that back, didn't you?

22:27.757 --> 22:29.274
That's what I'm offering you.

22:29.442 --> 22:31.032
Springtime forever.

22:31.432 --> 22:33.534
Ten years from now
you are still 15.

22:33.694 --> 22:35.868
A hundred?
Maybe 17.

22:37.930 --> 22:39.157
Eat well.

22:39.382 --> 22:43.651
Stay young. Live long.

23:53.712 --> 23:54.601
You like it?

23:55.725 --> 23:56.598
Sorry I was just...

23:56.882 --> 23:59.482
That's okay, 
people love to look at it.

24:00.296 --> 24:02.048
We used to set this up 
in the library.

24:02.444 --> 24:05.383
Community project just
taken a life on its own.

24:05.532 --> 24:07.362
We started with a
clock town there.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.510
- Oh yeah.
- Just keeps growing.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.721
Kids call it "Tiny Town".

24:11.760 --> 24:12.957
The kids built this?

24:13.314 --> 24:14.748
With some help, oh yeah.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.801
Keep it up.
Built the whole Town square.

24:19.515 --> 24:23.674
Are you off the bus,
or riding near town?

24:23.674 --> 24:24.748
Yeah, the bus.

24:25.588 --> 24:27.573
Not many ride bus 
this far North.

24:27.721 --> 24:29.853
Unless, they are looking 
for work.

24:33.185 --> 24:34.701
Yeah.

24:35.777 --> 24:37.606
Change of scenery, or...

24:37.828 --> 24:39.823
You're running away 
from something?

24:41.821 --> 24:43.272
Don't mind me hop on.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.431
- New face, that's all.
- Yeah.

24:46.330 --> 24:49.054
So I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

24:52.861 --> 24:55.724
Running away from yourself,
that is a pickle.

24:57.236 --> 24:59.366
You take yourself with you 
wherever you go.

24:59.624 --> 25:00.856
Isn't that the bitch?

25:03.316 --> 25:05.886
Rent's $85 a week,
payable upfront.

25:06.045 --> 25:09.240
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

25:09.555 --> 25:13.194
No pets. No parties.
No noise.

25:13.359 --> 25:15.024
I am a quiet time.

25:15.908 --> 25:17.556
Last guy said the same.

25:17.797 --> 25:19.226
Math student.

25:20.031 --> 25:21.992
Even let him paint the wall 
all blackboard,

25:21.992 --> 25:24.406
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

25:25.006 --> 25:27.057
Wasn't quiet, no so.

25:27.931 --> 25:31.048
Didn't even paint over this when he left.
But I'm glad I didn't.

25:31.224 --> 25:33.620
'Cause I can make this easy 
for you.

25:33.797 --> 25:36.135
So you see it every morning 
when you wake.

25:39.465 --> 25:41.915
- You sure you wanna vouch for this pup?
- Pretty sure.

25:42.633 --> 25:44.206
It's your ass, Billy.

25:45.093 --> 25:46.547
Bleeding heart this one.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.885
I'm downstairs, ground floor, 
if you need anything.

25:53.004 --> 25:55.168
Find me tomorrow,
we'll talk about some work.

25:57.009 --> 25:58.416
Why are you doing this?

25:59.272 --> 26:00.522
You don't know me.

26:00.765 --> 26:02.417
No I don't.

26:02.758 --> 26:05.083
But I know the look, 
like I said.

26:05.569 --> 26:06.846
And sometimes I...

26:07.660 --> 26:10.370
get this feeling about people,
hard to understand, I guess.

26:12.065 --> 26:13.525
Easier than you think.

26:15.325 --> 26:16.921
- Thanks.
- All right.

26:38.277 --> 26:39.464
You ready?

26:42.153 --> 26:43.243
She's ready.

26:48.561 --> 26:49.852
Who are these people?

26:50.019 --> 26:51.566
You'll find out after.

26:52.619 --> 26:55.358
Right over there is Grampa Flick,
and he'll lead us.

26:55.358 --> 26:56.597
Lie down.

26:57.307 --> 26:58.819
There.

27:03.175 --> 27:06.774
No fear, you understand?

27:15.117 --> 27:19.363
We are the True Knot,
and we endure.

27:22.201 --> 27:24.201
We are the chosen ones.

27:26.266 --> 27:28.927
We are the fortunate ones.

27:32.082 --> 27:35.981
What is tied, cannot be untied.

27:39.279 --> 27:41.844
Here is a woman.

27:42.052 --> 27:43.693
Would she join us?

27:45.637 --> 27:50.197
Would she tie her life 
to our life?

27:50.705 --> 27:51.702
Yes.

27:51.877 --> 27:53.085
Yes.

27:53.247 --> 27:56.353
Say "yes".

27:57.741 --> 27:58.941
Yes.

28:00.666 --> 28:02.404
This one's special.

28:03.529 --> 28:04.865
Her name's Violet.

28:05.372 --> 28:07.213
There is not much of her left.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.327
And she tastes

28:11.973 --> 28:13.870
like flowers.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.978
Breathe deep.

28:46.163 --> 28:49.687
There, embrace it.

28:52.829 --> 28:54.199
Embrace it.

29:06.027 --> 29:06.968
No!

29:08.775 --> 29:11.869
No!

29:58.251 --> 30:00.988
They haven't found us yet.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.464
They were used
to hearing him cry.

30:04.985 --> 30:07.824
'Cause I left him alone 
for so much.

30:09.846 --> 30:11.917
So they didn't do anything.

30:15.219 --> 30:18.094
And they haven't found us yet.

30:25.455 --> 30:26.216
Mommy?

30:47.379 --> 30:48.229
Hey.

30:49.851 --> 30:51.889
You said that you knew my look.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.304
What did you mean?

30:56.071 --> 30:57.510
You're sick.

30:57.962 --> 31:00.173
You're tired. 
I can see that much.

31:02.350 --> 31:04.001
I need help.

31:08.184 --> 31:10.749
Come on in.
We'll talk about it.

31:14.383 --> 31:18.753
<i>God, grant me the serenity to accept 
the things that I cannot change, </i>

31:18.753 --> 31:21.355
<i>the courage to change
the things that I can, </i>

31:21.355 --> 31:23.630
<i>and the wisdom 
to know the difference. </i>

31:24.392 --> 31:26.067
Bobby's got a big birthday today.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.230
Three years, three years sober.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.291
Thanks, John.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.063
Now for the most important person 
in the room.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.071
Is anybody here a newbie?

31:39.294 --> 31:40.965
Somebody's got 24 hours?

31:44.231 --> 31:45.238
Yeah.

31:53.148 --> 31:54.224
New to town, huh?

31:54.605 --> 31:55.843
Yeah, I...

31:56.005 --> 31:58.394
Nothing personal I delivered
half of the people in that room.

31:58.479 --> 32:00.894
- So it's new faces part, that's all.
- This is Dan Torrance.

32:01.017 --> 32:02.550
He's fresh off the bus.

32:03.112 --> 32:05.368
Fresh off the ground, 
by the look?

32:07.205 --> 32:08.749
There's no judgment here, brother.

32:08.903 --> 32:11.568
I mean, we've all been there,
and worse, trust me.

32:11.568 --> 32:12.269
Oh yeah.

32:12.691 --> 32:14.666
If you are looking for a wing 
to climb under.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.720
I can't say you do any better 
than Billy Freeman here.

32:17.822 --> 32:20.188
Well, thank you for your hospitality.

32:21.593 --> 32:23.002
I'm a little...

32:24.167 --> 32:25.889
I guess I'm not used to it.

32:26.052 --> 32:27.125
Well, you know what we say.

32:27.272 --> 32:29.437
You can't judge someone 
till you know the whole story.

32:29.598 --> 32:31.295
You might think you understand, but...

32:31.433 --> 32:32.655
- You don't.
- You don't.

32:33.973 --> 32:35.295
How are you today, all right?

32:35.295 --> 32:36.465
Our train is still running.

32:36.837 --> 32:38.056
That's good to hear.

32:38.724 --> 32:39.719
You good?

32:39.890 --> 32:41.849
Yeah.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.302
- Well, good to know you, Dan.
- Yeah.

32:44.302 --> 32:45.452
- Come again.
- Thanks.

32:45.452 --> 32:47.575
- Hope to see you again soon.
- I'll come back, yeah.

32:48.845 --> 32:51.560
Really good man,
he's got a gift.

32:51.706 --> 32:52.917
Hey, Billy, hang on.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.575
Hey, Doc?

32:56.824 --> 32:58.136
Your watch.

32:59.475 --> 33:01.844
You lost your watch, you were worried 
about the kid with...

33:02.525 --> 33:04.415
Gauche, Guchers...

33:06.064 --> 33:06.826
What?

33:07.023 --> 33:11.801
The kid with Guchers, 
or Gauchers, the bone thing...

33:14.564 --> 33:17.035
- Gaucher's disease.
- Right.

33:17.361 --> 33:19.831
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom and

33:20.050 --> 33:21.953
you left it on the soap dispenser.

33:24.289 --> 33:26.317
Well, just check 
on the soap dispenser.

33:26.902 --> 33:28.510
- It was good to meet you.
- Yeah.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.519
How did you know?

33:36.817 --> 33:38.126
I wish I could say.

33:40.204 --> 33:41.452
Lucky guess.

33:44.699 --> 33:45.947
My ass.

33:47.007 --> 33:50.939
Intuition I suppose.
Like a feeling in my gut, maybe...

33:52.456 --> 33:54.380
A lucky guess.

33:54.855 --> 33:56.134
What do you wanna do here?

33:58.156 --> 33:59.077
What do you mean?

33:59.243 --> 34:02.490
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

34:04.194 --> 34:06.144
I don't know.
I don't know.

34:06.343 --> 34:09.378
Something different
than I've been doing...

34:11.199 --> 34:12.590
Something better.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.856
You go to church?

34:18.960 --> 34:19.900
Does it matter?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.945
Do you believe in something, 
something

34:24.147 --> 34:25.550
bigger than you?

34:28.027 --> 34:29.937
Our beliefs don't make us 
better people.

34:30.963 --> 34:33.041
Our actions make us better people.

34:35.661 --> 34:38.266
So Billy says you have 
orderly experience?

34:38.266 --> 34:39.739
That's right.

34:40.033 --> 34:41.174
You're working right now?

34:41.556 --> 34:44.619
Few shifts at Tiny Town,
helping with the train.

34:44.826 --> 34:47.877
'Cause I do 3 days a week
at Rivington House hospice.

34:48.393 --> 34:50.538
Good orderly is tough to find.

34:50.702 --> 34:51.893
Tougher to keep.

34:53.393 --> 34:55.056
Do dying people bother you?

34:55.685 --> 34:56.918
No.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.598
We're all dying.

34:58.762 --> 35:01.895
We're all just 
one big hospice with fresh air.

35:47.626 --> 35:49.709
Oh, hi there.

35:50.766 --> 35:52.303
You said it didn't hurt.

35:54.671 --> 35:57.172
Doesn't now, does it?

35:57.623 --> 35:59.271
It felt like I was dying.

36:00.429 --> 36:01.954
I know.

36:02.312 --> 36:03.560
You did.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.383
You'll feel better when you eat.

36:06.883 --> 36:08.558
Am I still human?

36:09.889 --> 36:11.976
Do you care?

36:39.001 --> 36:39.835
Hey.

36:40.443 --> 36:41.537
Let it be.

36:43.974 --> 36:45.431
Azrael, leave him be.

36:55.727 --> 36:56.778
Azzie?

36:58.453 --> 36:59.731
Azzie, come on.

37:00.849 --> 37:03.307
Come on, Azzie.

37:03.718 --> 37:04.721
Doc?

37:05.874 --> 37:07.143
Is that you, Doc?

37:07.774 --> 37:09.156
No, I'm not a doctor.

37:09.439 --> 37:11.394
Do you want me 
to get you a doctor?

37:11.589 --> 37:12.988
The cat's on my bed.

37:13.155 --> 37:15.062
- Oh, I'll move her.
- No.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.732
I knew she would be.

37:18.573 --> 37:22.106
That cat always seems to know

37:24.406 --> 37:25.617
when it's time.

37:27.694 --> 37:29.059
I guess it's time.

37:29.238 --> 37:32.749
No, it's just Azzie being 
a silly old cat.

37:32.906 --> 37:33.906
Nope.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.381
Been that way 
ever since I got here.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.979
The cat knows

37:40.828 --> 37:42.591
when it's time to go to sleep.

37:43.101 --> 37:44.581
Everybody knows that.

37:46.789 --> 37:48.186
I'm gonna die.

37:59.275 --> 38:00.337
Yes.

38:01.672 --> 38:03.556
- Let me get you someone.
- No.

38:05.699 --> 38:08.361
I've known it was coming.

38:10.637 --> 38:12.773
Doesn't make it less scary.

38:12.988 --> 38:13.920
Yeah.

38:14.437 --> 38:16.245
Maybe it's just like you say.

38:16.781 --> 38:18.470
Just going to sleep.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.730
I mean there's nothing scary, 
it's just sleeping.

38:23.159 --> 38:25.389
You are a strange type of doctor.

38:25.642 --> 38:27.293
I told you I'm not a doctor.

38:27.467 --> 38:29.299
I think you are.

38:30.222 --> 38:31.833
<i>Doctor Sleep</i>.

38:32.366 --> 38:35.679
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt or be dark,

38:35.956 --> 38:38.993
or be nothing at all,
and I don't wanna...

38:38.993 --> 38:40.791
Nothing to be scared of.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.346
Just going to sleep.

38:44.777 --> 38:49.975
Finally true, restful sleep.

38:53.504 --> 38:55.009
Thank you.

38:56.199 --> 38:57.889
Thank you, doc.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.448
Look, I shouldn't be here.

39:01.611 --> 39:03.445
- Let me go get you some...
- No, no, no.

39:03.698 --> 39:07.101
You're exactly 
where you should be.

39:09.626 --> 39:10.995
Exactly.

39:15.622 --> 39:17.287
I see my wife.

40:54.442 --> 40:56.124
Dan, alcoholic.

40:56.437 --> 40:57.616
Hi, Dan.

40:57.947 --> 40:59.466
I'm not much of a speech guy.

41:00.423 --> 41:02.120
Just thought I'll hold 
the chip and

41:02.470 --> 41:04.273
talk about whatever popped up.

41:05.350 --> 41:07.749
I'm thinking about my dad.

41:08.978 --> 41:12.185
He died when I was 5, 
so the only way I got to know him,

41:12.479 --> 41:16.681
I really got to know him 
was when I went dark.

41:16.852 --> 41:18.849
When I drank.

41:19.205 --> 41:21.016
To dull the...

41:21.534 --> 41:22.582
Or...

41:23.598 --> 41:25.501
Whenever I wanted to break 
someone's face.

41:25.869 --> 41:29.704
'Cause the drinking 
and the temper and the anger.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.454
Those things in me were his.

41:32.621 --> 41:34.262
And they were all 
I could know of him.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.707
But now.

41:38.845 --> 41:41.598
Well, now I get to know
him a little different, 'cause

41:43.079 --> 41:45.426
he also stood 
in a room like this once.

41:46.611 --> 41:51.077
Wanting to get well
for me, my mom.

41:53.033 --> 41:56.830
And he has a chip in his hand, 
and chip said "5 months".

41:57.658 --> 42:00.135
And on that day he...

42:00.491 --> 42:02.112
Before it all.

42:04.475 --> 42:08.371
Well, on that day all he wanted in the world 
was to stand where I'm standing now.

42:09.862 --> 42:11.614
And here I am, so...

42:13.238 --> 42:15.721
So, thank you for us both, 
I guess.

42:17.151 --> 42:18.693
This is for Jack Torrance.

42:36.143 --> 42:37.299
Hey, Charlie.

42:40.356 --> 42:41.324
Doc?

42:44.260 --> 42:49.731
Guess I don't need to ask
why you are here this hour.

42:51.949 --> 42:53.904
You have pain?

42:54.073 --> 42:56.365
Do you want me to get
Claudette to bring you a pill?

42:57.900 --> 42:59.340
Pill won't matter.

43:01.626 --> 43:05.366
I'm not scared of Hell, Doc.

43:05.798 --> 43:09.577
I lived a decent life.

43:10.368 --> 43:12.640
Don't think there is 
such a place anyway.

43:13.595 --> 43:15.236
I guess I'm scared

43:17.025 --> 43:19.422
there's nothing.

43:20.229 --> 43:21.911
We don't end, Charlie.

43:23.182 --> 43:25.261
I know that for certain.

43:25.435 --> 43:27.262
I don't know much else, but

43:28.766 --> 43:31.031
I know that we don't end.

43:33.225 --> 43:34.852
Blueberries.

43:34.990 --> 43:40.044
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.428
Can you taste them?

43:42.598 --> 43:44.618
Yeah, I can.

43:46.584 --> 43:49.170
And I can hear Frank over radio.

43:49.503 --> 43:52.897
One used to have a new work bench 
next to your tools.

43:53.884 --> 43:55.830
♪ Come fly with me ♪

43:56.322 --> 44:00.004
♪ Let's fly, let's fly away ♪

44:00.220 --> 44:04.289
♪ If you can use 
some exotic booze ♪

44:04.446 --> 44:08.016
♪ There's a bar in far Bombay ♪

44:08.517 --> 44:10.472
♪ Come fly with me ♪

44:10.616 --> 44:14.621
♪ Let's fly, let's fly ♪

44:15.034 --> 44:16.904
♪ Away ♪

44:27.488 --> 44:29.282
In a minute, little pen pal.

44:44.929 --> 44:46.819
Abra, school.

44:48.147 --> 44:49.961
Fine, I know.

45:08.633 --> 45:09.998
Hey gramps, 
have you seen Rosie?

45:10.820 --> 45:12.632
Watchtower.

45:14.689 --> 45:16.161
You feeling okay?

45:16.692 --> 45:18.292
Peach okay.

45:36.855 --> 45:37.923
Hey.

45:40.084 --> 45:41.439
Sorry to interrupt.

45:41.637 --> 45:42.686
Any luck?

45:43.681 --> 45:44.685
Getting closer.

45:45.812 --> 45:47.714
He's somewhere in Iowa, I think.

45:48.714 --> 45:52.318
We'll all take a nice long road trip
once I'm sure I found him.

45:55.363 --> 45:57.327
But until I do...

45:57.640 --> 46:00.307
You gotta open the canister, Rosie.

46:00.422 --> 46:03.909
We took steam 6 months ago, Crow, 
6 months is nothing.

46:04.472 --> 46:08.104
That kid in Delaware wasn't so steamy 
and it's already showing.

46:08.450 --> 46:10.872
- You see Grandpa Flick's hair, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:11.303 --> 46:12.312
I don't think he's well.

46:13.237 --> 46:15.855
Grandpa Flick hasn't been well 
since Nixon was in office.

46:15.981 --> 46:17.373
I know, but...

46:18.215 --> 46:21.017
We need to eat, all of us.

46:22.477 --> 46:24.099
Or the canisters just low?

46:24.517 --> 46:25.382
Of course not.

46:25.382 --> 46:29.422
Just no need to waste one 
if you are close to a kill.

46:31.197 --> 46:32.197
Rosie.

46:32.609 --> 46:35.066
I might need it
just to find him.

46:38.990 --> 46:40.348
We used to be more steamy.

46:40.505 --> 46:41.922
Don't be daft, come on.

46:42.557 --> 46:43.454
That's like a root say:

46:43.579 --> 46:46.029
in 50 years I grow, 
people used to be more neighborly.

46:46.307 --> 46:47.574
But it's true, Rosie.

46:47.610 --> 46:49.797
There's less steam out there 
and it's weaker too.

46:50.349 --> 46:53.222
Don't know if it's their cell phones,
or diets or Netflix or what,

46:53.222 --> 46:55.738
but I am not picking up 
any sense these days,

46:55.738 --> 46:57.286
and once that I do, Rosie, 
they are just...

46:57.286 --> 46:59.671
I'll open the canister tonight
to tight everyone up.

46:59.671 --> 47:01.184
Thank you.

47:07.387 --> 47:09.404
- You know what, Rosie?
- I know what?

47:09.716 --> 47:10.846
It's why you up here every day.

47:11.003 --> 47:14.080
It's why you are always up here,
no matter what you tell the others.

47:14.808 --> 47:18.348
The world's not as steamy, 
and you are looking for a whale.

48:07.217 --> 48:09.075
Watch this kid. 
Number 19.

48:09.611 --> 48:10.883
That kid is a natural.

48:11.580 --> 48:13.372
He hits the ball every time.

48:13.529 --> 48:15.929
Like he can read 
the pitcher's mind.

48:16.254 --> 48:17.521
Is that right?

48:25.654 --> 48:26.868
See, you watch.

48:26.998 --> 48:28.793
One of these days 
one of those talent scouts

48:28.793 --> 48:31.480
is gonna give win 
to Brad there, you watch.

48:53.502 --> 48:55.344
Hey, 19.

48:55.982 --> 48:57.904
Just saw your game.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.312
You are ready for the majors.

49:00.502 --> 49:02.088
- Well played.
- Thanks.

49:02.233 --> 49:03.861
Hey, you're heading home?

49:04.174 --> 49:06.299
You wanna hop in,
I'll give you a ride.

49:07.423 --> 49:09.325
No, it's real close.

49:09.692 --> 49:10.611
I'm good.

49:13.220 --> 49:14.262
It's okay.

49:14.885 --> 49:18.359
We're friends, you wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

49:19.231 --> 49:20.801
You can take me right home.

49:21.870 --> 49:23.202
You trust me.

49:24.190 --> 49:25.449
I trust you.

50:00.808 --> 50:02.921
No, no please!

50:14.581 --> 50:16.410
No! Please let me go!

50:16.574 --> 50:19.489
Please I won't tell, please!

50:22.763 --> 50:24.779
Number 19.

50:25.955 --> 50:27.327
Kid you were good.

50:27.341 --> 50:29.643
No!

50:34.155 --> 50:36.554
No, please let me go!

50:36.989 --> 50:39.436
I won't tell, I won't tell!
Please!

50:39.823 --> 50:40.867
It's okay.

50:41.036 --> 50:42.189
Please.

50:50.637 --> 50:52.456
Are you gonna hurt me?

50:53.078 --> 50:54.157
Yes.

50:54.157 --> 50:56.022
No!

50:57.439 --> 50:59.640
Pain purifies steam.

50:59.832 --> 51:02.877
Fear too, so, you understand.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.421
Stop.

51:57.042 --> 51:58.239
Stop!

51:58.637 --> 51:59.784
Stop!

52:01.956 --> 52:03.553
Stop, monster!

52:10.408 --> 52:12.081
Stop, stop.

52:12.970 --> 52:13.996
Who is it?

52:24.862 --> 52:26.690
Stop, stop!

52:31.820 --> 52:32.981
Abra!

52:33.380 --> 52:34.125
Abra!

52:34.230 --> 52:36.349
No, no!

52:36.577 --> 52:37.617
Stop it!

52:37.757 --> 52:39.033
- Abra.
- Stop it!

52:48.362 --> 52:49.385
Jesus.

53:34.776 --> 53:36.202
Okay.

53:36.853 --> 53:38.373
Okay.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.822
Okay.

54:43.119 --> 54:44.250
Okay, ready?

54:58.345 --> 55:00.569
They killed him.

55:00.770 --> 55:03.139
They killed him.

55:07.885 --> 55:09.470
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

55:21.007 --> 55:23.010
We had a looker.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.050
Tonight?

55:30.549 --> 55:31.906
Yeah.

55:32.375 --> 55:33.494
Big steam?

55:34.652 --> 55:36.369
Oh, honey, it was huge.

55:38.145 --> 55:39.128
Where?

55:39.482 --> 55:42.442
East Coast, I think.

55:44.587 --> 55:48.665
You are saying someone looked in 
from 1500 miles away?

55:50.072 --> 55:51.721
Maybe farther.

55:53.691 --> 55:54.969
Boy or girl?

55:55.107 --> 55:56.473
Girl, I think.

55:56.959 --> 55:58.981
She was out of there so fast.

56:00.291 --> 56:02.013
But I swear, Crow Daddy.

56:03.104 --> 56:05.568
I haven't felt power like that.

56:06.799 --> 56:11.766
Raw power like that in so long.

56:12.958 --> 56:14.261
Do we need to look into it?

56:15.095 --> 56:16.848
Sooner the better.

56:17.273 --> 56:18.775
Kid's parents freak out.

56:18.980 --> 56:21.228
Send her to a psychiatrist.

56:21.515 --> 56:24.397
And they get her on pills.
Could ruin the steam.

56:25.666 --> 56:28.062
No, giving back,
so this kid it's like

56:28.385 --> 56:30.923
turning a piece of 
saran wrap over searchlight.

56:31.262 --> 56:32.614
I don't know where she is.

56:33.290 --> 56:36.299
But when she comes back, 
and she'll be back.

56:37.506 --> 56:39.508
Oh, I'll be ready, honey.

56:41.882 --> 56:43.630
I'll be ready.

57:44.591 --> 57:45.399
Morning.

57:46.177 --> 57:47.102
Morning.

57:48.878 --> 57:49.939
Guess what?

57:50.247 --> 57:51.990
I made a new friend.

57:52.240 --> 57:53.375
His name is Dan.

57:53.886 --> 57:55.331
Abbs, are you okay?

57:56.179 --> 57:57.328
Last night, I...

57:57.485 --> 57:58.883
I'm okay.

57:59.530 --> 58:00.611
Sorry about that.

58:00.611 --> 58:03.756
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

58:04.303 --> 58:08.365
And you pick up 
some weird stations.

58:08.365 --> 58:09.718
Nothing weird like that.

58:10.491 --> 58:12.361
Not anymore.

58:21.487 --> 58:22.349
All right...

58:22.684 --> 58:25.162
I gotta study,
if I don't study...

58:25.527 --> 58:29.099
Running place, hand off to 11, and...

58:29.193 --> 58:31.305
Coach is gonna kill me if I'm...

58:32.618 --> 58:34.366
Why doesn't he like me?

58:34.589 --> 58:36.419
My hair?
Should I change my haircut?

58:36.419 --> 58:37.935
The freak is staring at me again.

58:38.128 --> 58:39.832
What is she staring at?

58:40.039 --> 58:40.835
Freak.

59:20.712 --> 59:22.661
- Hey, Abadoo.
- Hey, dad.

59:23.216 --> 59:24.263
Is school okay?

59:25.511 --> 59:26.659
How is the book?

59:27.186 --> 59:27.936
Good.

59:28.078 --> 59:29.087
Yeah, going good.

59:29.087 --> 59:31.276
I'm writing about Charleston
and Black Bottom.

59:31.556 --> 59:33.302
And it's, you know like...

59:33.302 --> 59:35.805
I'm going to start my homework.

59:35.972 --> 59:37.668
Okay. Good.

59:37.797 --> 59:38.863
That's good, sweetie.

59:39.279 --> 59:40.977
Think Harvard in 3 years.

59:41.604 --> 59:44.572
- Will see
- Yeah, we will see.

01:03:20.526 --> 01:03:22.538
Well, hi there.

01:03:30.797 --> 01:03:32.021
Get out!

01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:35.375
Get out!
Get out off my head!

01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:38.098
Get out!

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:49.896
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! Don't!

01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:51.713
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:53.265 --> 01:03:54.705
I'm fine.

01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:03.207
Jesus.

01:04:04.284 --> 01:04:05.519
Dan?

01:04:05.931 --> 01:04:07.618
Dan?

01:04:07.888 --> 01:04:09.465
Get up.

01:04:09.853 --> 01:04:10.853
Come on, Dan.

01:04:12.722 --> 01:04:14.758
- What happened?
- You just dropped.

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:17.066
I thought you were having a stroke.

01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:18.602
Who's Tony?

01:04:19.699 --> 01:04:20.254
What?

01:04:20.415 --> 01:04:22.206
You kept saying 
"Please help me, Tony".

01:04:25.481 --> 01:04:27.299
I'm sorry about that.

01:04:47.639 --> 01:04:48.927
Rosie?

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.067
We've got a problem.

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:03.949
- Talk to me.
- The looker.

01:05:04.587 --> 01:05:05.788
Yeah, she found me again.

01:05:06.607 --> 01:05:07.319
How?

01:05:07.319 --> 01:05:09.062
I don't know,
I don't care.

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:12.762
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to!

01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:15.234
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

01:05:15.234 --> 01:05:18.444
No. I don't know, I don't, I don't think.
That's not the important, look...

01:05:19.532 --> 01:05:21.532
I said she's huge steam, right?

01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:23.570
Yeah, it's even bigger than that.

01:05:24.047 --> 01:05:25.416
I tried to turn around on her

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:28.563
and she blew me out of her 
like I was nothing.

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:31.364
- Bullshit.
- No, never happened to me, ever.

01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:33.681
I would've said 
that was impossible.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.668
Is she food 
or do we turn her?

01:05:38.614 --> 01:05:40.250
We don't turn her.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.777
Rosie, are you sure?

01:05:41.777 --> 01:05:43.172
If she's what you say she is...

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.783
Then we don't want anyone
with that power than us.

01:05:46.515 --> 01:05:48.362
Jeez, think about it.

01:05:53.678 --> 01:05:54.850
Have a great day.

01:05:55.071 --> 01:05:56.335
You too.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.306
Hi.

01:07:26.712 --> 01:07:27.990
Billy.

01:07:46.367 --> 01:07:47.468
You can hear me?

01:07:47.738 --> 01:07:50.520
Let's use our outside voices, 
all right?

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.130
You tracked me down?

01:07:53.294 --> 01:07:54.732
It was easier than I thought.

01:07:55.043 --> 01:07:56.999
Like, GPS, but in my head.

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.461
Look, I don't mean any offense, but

01:07:59.827 --> 01:08:04.048
this day and age, a grow man sitting 
with a teenage girl on a park bench...

01:08:04.048 --> 01:08:07.127
I'm Abra Stone, and if anyone asks - 
you are my uncle.

01:08:07.273 --> 01:08:08.889
Uncle Dan.

01:08:11.469 --> 01:08:14.309
And that's not even a lie, 
not totally.

01:08:14.467 --> 01:08:16.466
You magic, like me.

01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:20.124
I don't know about magic.

01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:23.925
I've always called it "the shining".

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.745
And yeah, we both shine.

01:08:27.205 --> 01:08:28.317
Do your parents know?

01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:30.629
About my shine?

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:32.907
They don't talk about it.

01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:36.576
Or if I use it, 
they look at me different.

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:39.325
When I was a kid 
I didn't understand the shining.

01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:40.866
I called it "Tony".

01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:43.323
Thought it was my
imaginary friend.

01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:46.140
I thought you were
my imaginary friend

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.957
for a long time.

01:08:50.055 --> 01:08:51.827
How many of us are out there?

01:08:53.724 --> 01:08:55.509
There are a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:56.879
they don't even know it.

01:08:57.232 --> 01:08:59.798
They always seem to come home
with flowers when their wives are sad,

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:02.407
or they do well in the school test 
they didn't study for.

01:09:02.843 --> 01:09:06.782
But I only met 2 or 3 people 
in my whole life who knew they shined.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.997
The baseball boy shined.

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:13.309
His name was Bradley Trevor.

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:18.227
These people.

01:09:19.023 --> 01:09:21.692
They look like people anyway, 
they took him

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:23.979
And they ate him.

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:27.625
They ate his shine.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.817
You could feel it?

01:09:30.987 --> 01:09:32.381
And he could feel me.

01:09:34.386 --> 01:09:35.821
If you could get something of his.

01:09:35.821 --> 01:09:37.273
If you could go to Iowa.

01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:39.102
- No, hang on...
- I can help you find him.

01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:40.673
That way his parents
would know where he was.

01:09:40.673 --> 01:09:42.491
They could bury him right 
at least.

01:09:42.742 --> 01:09:44.201
We could also get his glove.

01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:47.529
- If I can touch that glove I can track them.
- Easy, easy.

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:50.484
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name.

01:09:50.947 --> 01:09:52.856
For a while, before they killed him.

01:09:53.062 --> 01:09:54.736
He was wearing it.

01:10:06.378 --> 01:10:08.796
Abra, go home.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.048
Don't chase these people.

01:10:11.497 --> 01:10:13.159
Don't aggravate them.

01:10:13.355 --> 01:10:15.796
Whatever you do, 
don't attract their attention.

01:10:16.661 --> 01:10:18.258
Find something, anything.

01:10:18.258 --> 01:10:22.148
Well, almost anything to stop 
that shine of yours.

01:10:22.477 --> 01:10:24.599
Keep your head down 
and hope to God that these people

01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:26.499
and anything like them that they...

01:10:26.948 --> 01:10:28.635
That they don't see you.

01:10:29.707 --> 01:10:31.581
If they see you
they come back.

01:10:32.018 --> 01:10:33.991
Abra, do you hear me?

01:10:34.866 --> 01:10:37.183
They come back.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.233
Keep your head down, stay safe.

01:10:43.173 --> 01:10:45.106
I'm sorry.

01:10:55.269 --> 01:10:57.145
Hey, Azzie.

01:11:09.938 --> 01:11:12.342
You got your wires crossed tonight.

01:11:14.849 --> 01:11:16.436
That room's empty, Azzie.

01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:23.476
There's no one in that room.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.481
Hang on, Doc.

01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:35.610
Dick?

01:11:37.124 --> 01:11:38.682
I'm so sorry.

01:11:38.974 --> 01:11:41.378
- I thought it was...
- Thought I was from the Overlook.

01:11:42.446 --> 01:11:43.973
Almost locked me up.

01:11:44.519 --> 01:11:46.916
Still getting business
from them old ghosts?

01:11:47.184 --> 01:11:48.819
No, not for years.

01:11:49.007 --> 01:11:52.229
Horace Derwent was the last one, 
confetti on his suit.

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:54.441
Said: "Great party, isn't it?"

01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:57.562
Shit, he did a grin on his face 
till I pulled out box for him.

01:11:57.993 --> 01:11:59.391
That grin went fast.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:02.924
It never occurred me
to ask you back then.

01:12:03.244 --> 01:12:04.972
What happens to them 
in those boxes?

01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:06.372
Do they die in there?

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:08.191
Do you care?

01:12:10.511 --> 01:12:11.735
I missed you.

01:12:11.735 --> 01:12:13.512
Has it been a long time?

01:12:14.514 --> 01:12:15.701
Can't tell.

01:12:16.922 --> 01:12:20.042
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:23.038
Eight years, little more.

01:12:23.982 --> 01:12:25.166
Why are you here?

01:12:26.113 --> 01:12:28.872
I'm here because
it all comes round.

01:12:29.485 --> 01:12:31.485
Ka is a wheel, Doc.

01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:37.663
If these empty devils 
ever found you when you were a tank.

01:12:37.934 --> 01:12:39.951
If they'd even sniffed you

01:12:40.146 --> 01:12:41.902
you'd be long dead.

01:12:42.582 --> 01:12:47.024
They eat screams
and drink pain.

01:12:47.353 --> 01:12:50.460
And they've noticed
that little girl.

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:53.332
They might kill her.

01:12:54.302 --> 01:12:56.324
Might turn her.

01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:01.747
Or might keep her, till she's all used up 
and that'd be worst of all.

01:13:01.874 --> 01:13:03.838
You can't let them.

01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:07.626
Why me?

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:10.212
Because she found you.

01:13:10.395 --> 01:13:13.616
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

01:13:14.117 --> 01:13:18.041
You just rocked on into my kitchen 
one day and I'm still on the hook.

01:13:18.041 --> 01:13:20.560
What the hell 
am I supposed to do?

01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:24.470
Get her what she asked for.

01:13:26.795 --> 01:13:29.081
You won't see me again, Doc.

01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:32.092
This is my last dream.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:41.310
It seems to me 
you grew up fine, son.

01:13:41.854 --> 01:13:44.498
But you still owe a debt.

01:13:48.821 --> 01:13:50.178
Pay it.

01:13:53.718 --> 01:13:58.110
<font color="#00ffff">Subtitles by sub.Trader

01:14:06.448 --> 01:14:07.280
Hey.

01:14:07.436 --> 01:14:08.304
Hey, Mom.

01:14:08.424 --> 01:14:09.473
You're feeling okay?

01:14:09.801 --> 01:14:11.044
We missed you at dinner.

01:14:11.878 --> 01:14:14.599
I'm okay, 
just had a rough day.

01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:21.735
I'm flying out 
to see MoMo in the morning.

01:14:22.178 --> 01:14:24.065
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:14:26.002 --> 01:14:27.809
Abbs, does she...

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.733
She's gonna pull through this time?

01:14:37.496 --> 01:14:38.808
I don't know.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.640
But I hope so.

01:14:42.488 --> 01:14:43.821
Tell her I love her.

01:17:27.193 --> 01:17:29.655
Keep sleeping, princess.

01:17:43.061 --> 01:17:45.065
You hobs.

01:17:46.343 --> 01:17:49.326
You spend your whole lives, 
making little boxes.

01:17:49.873 --> 01:17:51.434
Little memories.

01:17:53.057 --> 01:17:55.442
You think they make you so rich?

01:17:55.777 --> 01:17:58.139
You should see mine, kiddo.

01:17:59.724 --> 01:18:02.762
My mind's a cathedral.

01:18:06.136 --> 01:18:08.543
Well, hi there.

01:18:32.722 --> 01:18:34.316
He said you'd come back.

01:18:35.895 --> 01:18:37.067
And you did.

01:18:38.926 --> 01:18:39.846
Good.

01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:45.014
Get back, get back!

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.835
You are just a fucking child.

01:18:54.207 --> 01:18:55.207
Where did you?

01:18:55.723 --> 01:18:56.925
Where...

01:18:56.925 --> 01:18:58.150
Where did you go?

01:18:58.257 --> 01:18:59.549
Where did you...

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:02.479
No.

01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:06.524
Get out!
Get out!

01:19:06.689 --> 01:19:07.863
Get out!

01:19:53.626 --> 01:19:54.461
Rose?

01:19:54.662 --> 01:19:55.633
Trap.

01:19:55.988 --> 01:19:57.195
Trap!

01:19:57.761 --> 01:19:58.738
What the hell happened?

01:19:59.088 --> 01:20:01.592
- Little bitch set a trap for me.
- Oh, your hand.

01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:03.850
Rose, calm down.
Calm down.

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:05.987
We know where she is now, right?
Now we know.

01:20:05.987 --> 01:20:07.455
She was in my head.

01:20:07.618 --> 01:20:09.164
- What?
- Stealing.

01:20:09.164 --> 01:20:11.615
- What does she know?
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:20:11.764 --> 01:20:13.592
- How much did she see?
- I don't know!

01:20:15.559 --> 01:20:16.506
There's a problem.

01:20:16.506 --> 01:20:17.563
Not now!

01:20:17.711 --> 01:20:19.390
Grandpa Flick.

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:21.519
I think he's cycling.

01:20:26.844 --> 01:20:28.527
Uncle Dan, Uncle Dan!

01:20:28.816 --> 01:20:30.795
I hurt her.
I really hurt her.

01:20:30.921 --> 01:20:33.012
I hurt her, and she deserved it, 
but that's not the best part.

01:20:33.139 --> 01:20:35.560
The best part is
I got in her head.

01:20:35.694 --> 01:20:37.090
I got in her head.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.130
- Uncle Dan?
- Oh, God, Abra.

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:42.421
What have you done?

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.031
Just talk to the kid.

01:21:01.043 --> 01:21:04.073
If we gonna do this,
then let's do this.

01:21:07.137 --> 01:21:08.485
Hi, Abra.

01:21:12.055 --> 01:21:13.260
I can hear you.

01:21:18.035 --> 01:21:19.449
I don't understand.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.908
You will.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.742
I thought we'll live forever.

01:21:25.726 --> 01:21:27.895
Did someone promise 
you that, Andi?

01:21:28.475 --> 01:21:30.765
Did someone say
you're immortal?

01:21:32.115 --> 01:21:35.997
I said: "live long, eat well".

01:21:37.115 --> 01:21:39.070
We can live long, very long.

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.300
And we do, most of us.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:43.868
But we haven't been eating well.

01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:47.266
Not for a long time.

01:21:48.335 --> 01:21:49.934
Rosie, he's going.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.615
Rosie.

01:21:58.319 --> 01:21:59.612
Yes, love?

01:22:01.023 --> 01:22:04.306
- I am scared.
- No, you are not.

01:22:05.723 --> 01:22:09.709
You watched 
empires rise and fall.

01:22:10.975 --> 01:22:13.275
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.509
Sailed across oceans
to new worlds.

01:22:18.661 --> 01:22:23.588
Fed on kings 
and princes, and popes.

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.846
They wrote myths of you.

01:22:26.888 --> 01:22:28.773
And made statues.

01:22:29.238 --> 01:22:36.321
And they trembled in their villages
and beds and skyscrapers.

01:22:37.873 --> 01:22:39.450
So no.

01:22:40.503 --> 01:22:42.765
You are not scared.

01:22:44.647 --> 01:22:46.224
You're a king.

01:22:47.347 --> 01:22:49.804
And you eat fear.

01:23:41.462 --> 01:23:42.318
Hey, bro.

01:23:43.282 --> 01:23:44.274
It's 4 AM.

01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:45.795
You've always seen me Billy.

01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:49.497
You have a good sense 
about people, is that fair to say?

01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:50.712
Yeah, but why?

01:23:50.712 --> 01:23:52.996
You think I'm an honest man, 
a good man?

01:23:53.285 --> 01:23:54.791
I do, I do, Dan.

01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:55.984
I need your help.

01:23:56.306 --> 01:23:58.151
But first thing I need 
is for you to listen to a story

01:23:58.282 --> 01:24:01.644
and try harder than 
you've ever tried to believe me.

01:24:17.988 --> 01:24:19.065
How is it going?

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.904
Hi, shouldn't you 
be getting ready for school?

01:24:23.164 --> 01:24:25.621
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.117
How long have you been driving?

01:24:27.285 --> 01:24:28.534
For few hours or so.

01:24:28.701 --> 01:24:30.944
We should get there tonight late.

01:24:33.397 --> 01:24:34.448
Who's that?

01:24:35.014 --> 01:24:36.310
That's my friend.

01:24:37.311 --> 01:24:39.003
Maybe my best friend.

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:42.125
You should've seen her face.

01:24:42.283 --> 01:24:44.084
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

01:24:44.233 --> 01:24:46.043
Scared like 
all those kids were scared.

01:24:46.233 --> 01:24:47.694
All those kids she's killed.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.276
She was so mad 
and so scared that I got in.

01:24:51.139 --> 01:24:52.261
That was a new trick.

01:24:52.674 --> 01:24:54.173
I've never done that before.

01:24:54.529 --> 01:24:56.575
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

01:24:57.104 --> 01:24:58.370
Like a library.

01:24:58.702 --> 01:25:00.853
I guess we're all libraries inside.

01:25:01.831 --> 01:25:03.240
Who did you do it?

01:25:03.384 --> 01:25:06.051
Like this, just a little push.

01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:11.694
Abra!

01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:13.632
Sorry, sorry.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.609
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

01:25:22.489 --> 01:25:23.943
What were all those boxes?

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.211
Nothing.

01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:26.422
Liar.

01:25:29.733 --> 01:25:31.033
When I was a kid,

01:25:32.277 --> 01:25:34.987
younger than you I bumped into 
something like these things,

01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:37.776
that ate like they do.

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:40.294
But it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

01:25:41.813 --> 01:25:45.272
They closed it downafter 
and let it rot.

01:25:46.482 --> 01:25:48.715
But the things 
that lived there, these...

01:25:50.987 --> 01:25:52.711
Don't go poking around there again.

01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:56.512
Okay. I won't, I promise.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.205
We are almost ready,
we are just, loading up.

01:26:11.302 --> 01:26:12.385
Good.

01:26:12.768 --> 01:26:15.679
We got the caravan on the road,
and we'll have her in a day or two.

01:26:15.679 --> 01:26:17.555
I don't think 
you should come, Rosie.

01:26:19.233 --> 01:26:21.066
The fuck did you just say?

01:26:21.066 --> 01:26:23.615
She attacked you,
she got in your head.

01:26:23.799 --> 01:26:24.984
Yeah, it won't happen again.

01:26:24.984 --> 01:26:27.370
And who knows how much 
she got to before you kicked her out?

01:26:27.524 --> 01:26:28.867
She's mine, Crow.

01:26:28.867 --> 01:26:32.695
Right now as far as we know
you are the only of us she could track.

01:26:32.909 --> 01:26:34.780
Now, she sees you coming...

01:26:34.954 --> 01:26:36.275
She could run,

01:26:36.449 --> 01:26:38.688
or set another trap.

01:26:41.961 --> 01:26:44.400
You know I'm right about this.

01:26:45.496 --> 01:26:47.146
If she pulls a trick on you.

01:26:49.501 --> 01:26:51.170
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:51.515 --> 01:26:53.452
But I got some tricks on my own.

01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:03.290
Yeah, I think we're here.

01:27:06.363 --> 01:27:07.253
Okay.

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.459
Will see if I can get her.

01:27:11.862 --> 01:27:12.900
Abra?

01:27:14.364 --> 01:27:15.597
That's the sign.

01:27:15.957 --> 01:27:17.075
Pull around back.

01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:18.788
She says to pull around back.

01:27:18.919 --> 01:27:22.293
- And I'll tell you when to stop.
- She'll tell us when to stop.

01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:29.543
How do I tell you, I don't know.

01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:32.712
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

01:27:32.712 --> 01:27:36.591
I mean if you are wrong - 
my friend is crazy.

01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:38.318
I mean full-blown

01:27:39.064 --> 01:27:43.892
mental breakdown imaginary monsters 
killing imaginary kids

01:27:44.388 --> 01:27:45.296
bonkers.

01:27:45.837 --> 01:27:48.062
But, you know.
I can work with that.

01:27:49.452 --> 01:27:51.451
- If you're right though.
- I know.

01:27:52.437 --> 01:27:53.693
So much worse.

01:28:08.313 --> 01:28:09.588
You should go home.

01:28:09.748 --> 01:28:11.193
What?

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.806
No, not you.

01:28:13.814 --> 01:28:15.002
I can handle it.

01:28:15.114 --> 01:28:16.091
No.

01:28:16.619 --> 01:28:18.136
We'll take it from here.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.433
Okay, it's just us.

01:28:39.498 --> 01:28:41.333
You smell that?

01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:46.206
I used to hunt, 
did I ever tell you that?

01:28:46.206 --> 01:28:47.367
No.

01:28:47.538 --> 01:28:48.503
Deer.

01:28:49.171 --> 01:28:50.485
This one summer.

01:28:51.574 --> 01:28:52.886
I clicked this buck.

01:28:53.552 --> 01:28:55.351
I was tracking him for 2 days.

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:57.506
I got the shot.

01:28:57.683 --> 01:29:01.002
Clicked him, he ran off,
I went after.

01:29:01.532 --> 01:29:04.440
Figured, he wasn't gonna last long.

01:29:06.882 --> 01:29:07.920
And he vanished.

01:29:08.617 --> 01:29:11.336
Just open, evaporated.

01:29:11.772 --> 01:29:14.459
Without a trace, truly baffling.

01:29:17.156 --> 01:29:18.217
Five days later.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.253
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

01:29:21.563 --> 01:29:25.238
I come around, 
looking for a spot for the blind.

01:29:26.893 --> 01:29:28.194
Then I smelled him.

01:29:29.481 --> 01:29:30.769
Smelled him.

01:29:32.005 --> 01:29:33.464
Found that buck.

01:29:33.929 --> 01:29:35.956
Held up to a hollow trunk.

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.768
Dead for days.

01:29:40.127 --> 01:29:41.346
The smell.

01:29:42.837 --> 01:29:44.999
Never hunted a day since.

01:29:48.347 --> 01:29:50.289
This is the same smell.

01:30:06.204 --> 01:30:07.313
Billy.

01:30:27.122 --> 01:30:28.314
Oh, my God!

01:30:37.541 --> 01:30:39.174
What the fuck?

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.036
Fuck.

01:31:02.389 --> 01:31:04.906
Fuck, Daniel!
What the fuck?!

01:31:04.967 --> 01:31:07.354
They didn't even bury him deeply.
They buried him shallow.

01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:09.067
I'm sorry, Billy.

01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:12.316
What did you get us into?

01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:21.913
The people who did that.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:24.054
They are not people.

01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:27.118
No, no they ain't.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.086
Who would wanna
do that to a little boy.

01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:31.803
They ain't people.

01:31:32.735 --> 01:31:33.906
Did you get it?

01:31:34.107 --> 01:31:35.266
Yeah, we got it.

01:31:35.266 --> 01:31:36.295
Is she back?

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.794
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

01:31:38.794 --> 01:31:40.152
We got a stop to make.

01:31:42.531 --> 01:31:44.848
I need you to show 
your parents what's happening.

01:31:45.596 --> 01:31:46.241
No.

01:31:46.386 --> 01:31:47.772
- Yeah.
- No.

01:31:47.772 --> 01:31:49.377
They almost think I'm normal.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:50.730
If I tell them, they'll...

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:52.387
Rose will go through them 
to get to you.

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:53.887
You know that, don't you?

01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:55.935
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

01:31:55.935 --> 01:31:57.907
And she's coming, Abra.

01:31:58.453 --> 01:31:59.903
They need to know.

01:32:04.988 --> 01:32:06.551
So what's the stop
we gotta make?

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.404
You still got 
those old deer rifles?

01:32:26.972 --> 01:32:27.971
You Uncle Dan?

01:32:28.696 --> 01:32:30.478
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Sir.

01:32:30.788 --> 01:32:32.186
She's 13 years old.

01:32:32.186 --> 01:32:33.453
Abra, I told you to show him.

01:32:33.697 --> 01:32:34.838
- I told him.
- That's not the same.

01:32:34.838 --> 01:32:36.319
I'm gonna kick your ass 
before I call the police, huh?

01:32:36.319 --> 01:32:37.831
- Hey.
- No, no, Abra.

01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:39.150
Don't you say her name!

01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:40.160
Abra.

01:32:55.021 --> 01:32:57.701
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone,
I am a friend.

01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:00.323
Everything she told you is true.

01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:14.356
- No thanks.
- No.

01:33:23.984 --> 01:33:25.148
Those people.

01:33:26.926 --> 01:33:28.441
They know about my daughter?

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.026
They do.

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.871
And sooner or later they're coming.

01:33:33.285 --> 01:33:34.417
I gotta do something.

01:33:34.559 --> 01:33:36.711
I will call the police, the FBI.

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:39.082
Those people have been around 
a long long time, sir.

01:33:39.374 --> 01:33:40.890
They're rich, connected.

01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:43.097
I don't think 
they're worried about the police.

01:33:43.374 --> 01:33:44.915
Where are they?

01:33:45.089 --> 01:33:47.404
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

01:33:47.545 --> 01:33:49.041
Abra can answer that.

01:33:49.477 --> 01:33:50.803
If she's ready.

01:33:52.073 --> 01:33:53.411
I'm ready.

01:34:03.126 --> 01:34:04.509
You sure you wanna do this?

01:34:05.211 --> 01:34:06.216
I have to.

01:34:48.713 --> 01:34:49.978
I-95.

01:34:50.489 --> 01:34:52.758
Barry, the Crow, 
the Snake and a few others.

01:34:53.331 --> 01:34:55.192
The trees haven't changed
that much so...

01:34:55.366 --> 01:34:57.201
Maybe Massachusetts, but...

01:34:57.567 --> 01:34:59.331
- They are close.
- Rose?

01:34:59.331 --> 01:35:00.794
Didn't see her.

01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:02.506
But they're coming.

01:35:06.411 --> 01:35:08.102
This is the only room she saw?

01:35:09.063 --> 01:35:09.978
That's right.

01:35:10.278 --> 01:35:13.295
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

01:35:13.831 --> 01:35:14.886
All right.

01:35:15.837 --> 01:35:17.622
Well, they'll be trying 
to track you.

01:35:18.214 --> 01:35:19.816
Try to catch on.

01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:23.336
And you gonna let them.

01:35:24.535 --> 01:35:25.792
Are you crazy?

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:27.544
Possibly, but you gonna let them.

01:35:28.231 --> 01:35:30.671
And then I need you 
to try and do a little trick.

01:35:31.616 --> 01:35:32.835
A magic trick?

01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.057
They're following us.

01:35:42.978 --> 01:35:45.274
Concentrate, you gotta
keep it up until they land.

01:35:45.833 --> 01:35:46.872
I know.

01:36:18.647 --> 01:36:19.738
This should work.

01:36:20.029 --> 01:36:22.450
Good blinds over and there.

01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.060
They still close?

01:36:27.234 --> 01:36:28.792
Getting closer, I think.

01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:30.188
This is tough.

01:36:30.188 --> 01:36:32.848
I know, I know,
how much longer?

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.087
Okay, Crow Daddy.

01:36:39.025 --> 01:36:40.811
Go get her.

01:37:27.332 --> 01:37:29.660
You look relaxed.

01:37:29.994 --> 01:37:33.034
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

01:37:33.687 --> 01:37:34.729
I guess.

01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:36.090
You should.

01:37:36.732 --> 01:37:38.125
Just relax.

01:37:38.497 --> 01:37:39.831
We're friends.

01:37:40.153 --> 01:37:41.758
You're friends.

01:37:41.925 --> 01:37:43.121
That's right.

01:37:43.962 --> 01:37:45.528
Just friends.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.187
And we wanna take you 
to meet more friends.

01:37:50.885 --> 01:37:52.641
Good friends.

01:37:56.492 --> 01:37:57.615
Oh, shit.

01:37:58.074 --> 01:37:59.167
They way they talked you up,

01:37:59.167 --> 01:38:01.312
I was thinking maybe 
a little harder than that.

01:38:06.403 --> 01:38:07.586
What the fuck?

01:38:08.143 --> 01:38:10.579
Parlor tricks, 
just fucking parlor tricks!

01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:16.304
No!
Get out of there!

01:38:16.696 --> 01:38:17.598
Get out of there!

01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:25.918
No!

01:38:39.752 --> 01:38:40.782
No!

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.535
You deserve it.

01:38:51.686 --> 01:38:54.228
You deserve it, all of you.

01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:00.467
No!

01:39:56.012 --> 01:39:57.012
Fuck.

01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:00.556
Stop.

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.837
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.852
Aren't you sleepy?

01:40:13.726 --> 01:40:15.324
You're sleepy.

01:40:20.099 --> 01:40:21.479
Sleep.

01:40:23.327 --> 01:40:24.858
Sleep!

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.505
Wake up, Uncle Dan!

01:40:28.625 --> 01:40:30.636
Wake up!

01:40:30.906 --> 01:40:32.789
Wake up!

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.066
Fucking men.

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:38.471
Fucking men.

01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:56.398
Stay back, Billy.

01:40:59.466 --> 01:41:01.085
Kill yourself.

01:41:03.715 --> 01:41:04.508
No.

01:41:04.983 --> 01:41:06.021
Billy!

01:41:22.906 --> 01:41:24.145
There is one missing.

01:41:25.104 --> 01:41:27.759
I didn't see the Crow,
where is the Crow?

01:41:29.974 --> 01:41:31.211
Hello, Abra.

01:41:37.334 --> 01:41:38.697
Abra!

01:42:11.906 --> 01:42:13.574
Good, you're awake.

01:42:24.069 --> 01:42:25.004
Dan.

01:42:25.182 --> 01:42:26.538
Don't bother.

01:42:33.737 --> 01:42:35.244
What's wrong with me?

01:42:35.644 --> 01:42:37.226
You've been dosed, Missy.

01:42:37.817 --> 01:42:40.030
More than 
I've ever used before.

01:42:40.443 --> 01:42:42.753
I let you wake up
here and there, but

01:42:42.975 --> 01:42:45.257
that steam of
yours is fast asleep.

01:42:48.771 --> 01:42:50.353
My dad.

01:42:51.233 --> 01:42:53.026
What happened to my dad?

01:42:53.188 --> 01:42:54.965
A lot of good people killed today.

01:42:55.926 --> 01:42:57.455
A lot of good people.

01:42:58.989 --> 01:43:00.847
I'd love to tell you 
someone will pay.

01:43:01.328 --> 01:43:05.841
Some kind of justice, raining down on 
the sad events today, but

01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.764
doesn't work like that.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.968
We were always gonna have you.

01:43:11.774 --> 01:43:13.612
Some of my people are dead.

01:43:14.329 --> 01:43:16.008
Some of yours are dead.

01:43:16.926 --> 01:43:18.924
Outcome didn't change still.

01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:21.594
Think on that a minute.

01:43:22.432 --> 01:43:24.128
The outcome didn't change,

01:43:24.747 --> 01:43:25.897
so their deaths,

01:43:27.018 --> 01:43:28.716
all of them -

01:43:29.074 --> 01:43:31.004
just a waste.

01:43:31.443 --> 01:43:34.046
The waste you brought
on to us all, young lady.

01:43:34.662 --> 01:43:36.033
For what?

01:43:37.666 --> 01:43:39.141
Please, hear me.

01:43:39.577 --> 01:43:41.121
Ain't nobody hearing you.

01:43:42.309 --> 01:43:45.621
May as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

01:43:46.133 --> 01:43:47.894
Like I said.

01:43:48.287 --> 01:43:50.499
Outcome hasn't changed.

01:44:10.907 --> 01:44:12.308
No.

01:44:13.813 --> 01:44:15.057
Please.

01:44:15.236 --> 01:44:16.768
Oh, please, please.

01:44:18.972 --> 01:44:20.116
Please.

01:44:23.524 --> 01:44:25.481
Abra.

01:44:28.177 --> 01:44:29.426
Abra.

01:44:36.484 --> 01:44:37.552
Tony?

01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:42.464
Help me, please, Tony.

01:44:47.793 --> 01:44:48.793
God.

01:44:59.249 --> 01:45:01.138
Okay, okay.

01:45:01.509 --> 01:45:02.659
Okay, okay.

01:45:01.509 --> 01:45:04.427
Okay, he always said your...

01:45:05.437 --> 01:45:06.986
Your brain was like a radio.

01:45:07.159 --> 01:45:09.401
No one's answering when you call, 
so stop calling

01:45:10.025 --> 01:45:11.694
and just listen.

01:45:29.341 --> 01:45:31.342
Dan, Dan.

01:45:31.505 --> 01:45:32.520
Help.

01:45:46.965 --> 01:45:47.844
Hi.

01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:49.953
Dan.

01:45:52.545 --> 01:45:53.671
Did he drug you?

01:45:55.199 --> 01:45:57.159
I'm so sorry.

01:45:58.022 --> 01:45:59.746
I'm gonna try something, okay?

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.074
But you're weak,
he's blocking you.

01:46:02.725 --> 01:46:04.192
I barely hear you.

01:46:05.173 --> 01:46:06.675
You gotta trust me, okay?

01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:09.846
Okay?

01:46:23.659 --> 01:46:25.809
Wake again, huh?

01:46:26.958 --> 01:46:29.911
May have to dose you 
at the next rest stop.

01:46:31.438 --> 01:46:32.834
Where are we going?

01:46:33.864 --> 01:46:35.042
You know where.

01:46:36.206 --> 01:46:38.363
Fuck, I feel hangover.

01:46:41.129 --> 01:46:42.802
Told you, it's good shit.

01:46:43.621 --> 01:46:46.840
Haven't had hangover in years,
and you know I don't miss it.

01:46:46.997 --> 01:46:48.375
Not even a little.

01:46:50.367 --> 01:46:51.727
West, huh?

01:46:52.177 --> 01:46:55.125
Stand off the major roads. Smart.

01:46:57.507 --> 01:47:00.185
Crownville, New York.

01:47:02.967 --> 01:47:04.438
Who are you?

01:47:05.354 --> 01:47:07.321
I'm the guy 
that killed your friends.

01:47:13.203 --> 01:47:14.772
It's nice to meet you.

01:47:16.456 --> 01:47:17.729
Neat trick.

01:47:17.894 --> 01:47:19.798
Haven't seen this one before.

01:47:20.175 --> 01:47:21.553
Wanna see one more?

01:47:24.969 --> 01:47:28.727
Don't imagine Rose would be 
too happy if you shoot the prize?

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.598
I don't suppose Rose would be 
happy about any of this.

01:47:34.889 --> 01:47:36.838
And when that woman gets mad.

01:47:37.423 --> 01:47:38.339
Well.

01:47:38.592 --> 01:47:42.439
Seems to me you know enough 
to know you might wanna sit this one out.

01:47:42.767 --> 01:47:45.522
Count your blessings,
go on your way.

01:47:48.366 --> 01:47:49.658
What's so funny, friend?

01:47:49.948 --> 01:47:52.192
Well, it's just arrogance.

01:47:52.536 --> 01:47:53.980
It's arrogance, really.

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:57.324
But, makes sense if you think 
you gonna live forever.

01:47:57.656 --> 01:47:59.247
Stands to reason.

01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.057
Of course, you wouldn't
wear your seat belt.

01:48:12.602 --> 01:48:14.612
No!

01:48:25.148 --> 01:48:26.185
Dan?

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.565
Dan?

01:49:00.512 --> 01:49:02.024
I hope that hurts.

01:49:02.559 --> 01:49:03.848
Rosie.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.666
A lot!

01:49:54.181 --> 01:49:56.621
You little bitch.

01:49:58.151 --> 01:49:59.751
What have you done?

01:50:11.627 --> 01:50:13.542
All right, bitch-child.

01:50:14.552 --> 01:50:15.577
All right.

01:51:23.671 --> 01:51:25.765
Sorry, dosed up.

01:51:26.051 --> 01:51:28.823
No, you earned it.

01:51:31.414 --> 01:51:32.519
Where are we?

01:51:32.694 --> 01:51:33.902
Ohio.

01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:36.663
- Where are we going?
- Colorado.

01:51:38.264 --> 01:51:39.832
Why Colorado?

01:51:42.512 --> 01:51:44.558
She's gonna keep coming.

01:51:45.349 --> 01:51:47.510
- I know.
- Always.

01:51:48.226 --> 01:51:51.493
This only ends if we end her
and I don't think we can beat her.

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:54.135
Not by ourselves.

01:51:55.928 --> 01:51:57.147
There's a place.

01:51:57.147 --> 01:51:59.407
Place, that's dangerous
for people like us.

01:52:00.234 --> 01:52:02.016
The place you told me about?

01:52:02.446 --> 01:52:04.379
- Hungry place?
- Yes, that's right.

01:52:04.437 --> 01:52:07.600
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

01:52:08.137 --> 01:52:10.036
If it's dangerous for people like us,

01:52:10.036 --> 01:52:13.334
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

01:52:13.338 --> 01:52:15.235
Maybe even more so.

01:52:16.227 --> 01:52:17.682
Good.

01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:20.305
She's following, you know.

01:52:21.312 --> 01:52:23.570
Yeah, good, let her.

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.556
I'm sorry about your father.

01:52:35.164 --> 01:52:36.956
Sorry about your friend.

01:53:00.066 --> 01:53:01.336
That's my mom.

01:53:02.003 --> 01:53:03.498
What do I say to her?

01:53:08.036 --> 01:53:08.912
Hi, Mom.

01:53:09.038 --> 01:53:10.353
Oh, thank God!

01:53:10.353 --> 01:53:12.991
Abra, are you okay?
Where are you?

01:53:14.275 --> 01:53:15.369
I love you.

01:53:18.365 --> 01:53:20.633
When we are safe 
you call her and tell where to find us.

01:53:20.815 --> 01:53:21.869
I will.

01:53:22.024 --> 01:53:22.967
Okay.

01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:59.368
Not too much farther.
Up in mountain.

01:55:34.915 --> 01:55:36.325
Here's what we gonna do.

01:55:36.478 --> 01:55:39.460
You gonna stay in the car,
keep the heat running.

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.702
I don't want you spending 
a minute inside there if you don't have to.

01:55:42.748 --> 01:55:44.235
She can only come from here.

01:55:44.756 --> 01:55:46.104
You'll see her mile out, easy.

01:55:46.104 --> 01:55:48.179
You see lights on the
mountain over there

01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.706
you blast me, okay?

01:55:50.029 --> 01:55:52.611
But I don't want you going in,
not until she's here.

01:55:53.492 --> 01:55:55.516
You're waiting with me?

01:55:55.984 --> 01:55:57.704
- I can't
- Why not?

01:55:58.893 --> 01:56:01.058
I have to wake it up.

01:57:02.388 --> 01:57:04.519
Wakey-wakey.

02:01:17.607 --> 02:01:19.516
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

02:01:19.516 --> 02:01:22.158
Not for long, I imagine.

02:01:23.169 --> 02:01:24.819
You are a whiskey man,
are you not?

02:01:25.285 --> 02:01:27.510
I was.
Most of the time.

02:01:35.155 --> 02:01:36.358
On the house.

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:41.861
This was your brand.

02:01:42.371 --> 02:01:43.604
Jack Daniels.

02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:46.191
I used to see the bottles in our home.

02:01:46.581 --> 02:01:48.418
Our real home before all this.

02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:53.742
I smelled one once, 
it smelled like something on fire, which

02:01:54.441 --> 02:01:56.520
I suppose it was.

02:01:57.136 --> 02:01:59.505
I'm afraid you've confused
me with someone else.

02:01:59.658 --> 02:02:00.919
It's Lloyd.

02:02:01.792 --> 02:02:03.261
Lloyd.

02:02:04.433 --> 02:02:06.243
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

02:02:06.582 --> 02:02:10.193
I don't know where everyone is, 
but it will pick up.

02:02:10.579 --> 02:02:12.331
Oh, I know where they are.

02:02:12.630 --> 02:02:13.830
And you are right.

02:02:14.916 --> 02:02:16.187
It'll pick up.

02:02:17.949 --> 02:02:20.744
If you don't mind my saying, 
Mr. Torrance, you seem

02:02:22.156 --> 02:02:23.621
put upon.

02:02:24.239 --> 02:02:25.387
Put upon?

02:02:25.893 --> 02:02:27.718
Pulled into other people's problems.

02:02:27.718 --> 02:02:30.882
I see it all the time, 
if you don't mind my saying.

02:02:33.331 --> 02:02:35.211
So we lived in Florida.

02:02:36.514 --> 02:02:37.401
I'm sorry?

02:02:37.646 --> 02:02:38.888
Mom and I.

02:02:40.723 --> 02:02:43.420
We never wanted
to see snow again.

02:02:43.801 --> 02:02:45.627
So we lived in Florida.

02:02:45.881 --> 02:02:48.617
Tiny place, but it was comfortable
and we were happy.

02:02:50.684 --> 02:02:52.542
I was 20 when she died.

02:02:53.053 --> 02:02:54.231
And back then,

02:02:54.939 --> 02:02:57.738
I saw when someone 
was gonna die I saw flies,

02:02:58.174 --> 02:03:00.598
black flies, death
flies I called them,

02:03:00.598 --> 02:03:02.836
circling people's faces.

02:03:03.039 --> 02:03:05.572
And in those last wakes
she was covered.

02:03:05.727 --> 02:03:09.808
Her whole face.
I could barely see her eyes.

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:15.648
And I tried to comfort her, 
but I could hardly look at her.

02:03:15.984 --> 02:03:17.665
And she saw that.

02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:26.934
Maybe something more 
to push away such unpleasantries?

02:03:26.934 --> 02:03:29.902
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:32.827
I think you've mistaken me 
for someone else.

02:03:33.024 --> 02:03:35.034
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:39.657
Just Lloyd the Bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook hotel?

02:03:39.657 --> 02:03:42.538
I'll pour whatever you like, 
Mr. Torrance.

02:03:49.559 --> 02:03:51.085
Man takes a drink.

02:03:52.485 --> 02:03:54.007
A drink takes the drink.

02:03:55.047 --> 02:03:56.997
And then the drink takes a man.

02:03:57.971 --> 02:03:59.413
Isn't it so, Dad?

02:04:03.781 --> 02:04:05.641
Medicine.

02:04:06.734 --> 02:04:09.144
Medicine is what it is.

02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:11.760
Bona fide cura.

02:04:12.402 --> 02:04:15.036
The mind is a blackboard,

02:04:15.215 --> 02:04:16.406
and this

02:04:17.010 --> 02:04:18.603
is the eraser.

02:04:23.843 --> 02:04:25.694
A man tries.

02:04:26.108 --> 02:04:27.108
He provides.

02:04:28.475 --> 02:04:30.479
But he's surrounded my mouths.

02:04:31.038 --> 02:04:32.731
And has family.

02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:35.792
A wife, a kid.

02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.079
Those mouths eat time.

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:40.886
They eat your days on Earth.

02:04:41.402 --> 02:04:43.402
It is gobbled him up.

02:04:45.016 --> 02:04:47.561
It's enough to make a man sick.

02:04:48.707 --> 02:04:50.040
And this

02:04:50.741 --> 02:04:52.606
is the medicine.

02:04:54.828 --> 02:04:56.718
So tell me, pup.

02:04:57.835 --> 02:05:00.497
Are you gonna take your medicine?

02:05:04.757 --> 02:05:06.050
I'm not.

02:05:08.769 --> 02:05:09.482
Dan.

02:05:09.934 --> 02:05:11.000
She's here.

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:30.912
Okay.

02:05:44.981 --> 02:05:47.204
This place is sick.

02:05:47.665 --> 02:05:49.939
Sick like my MoMo was sick.

02:05:50.178 --> 02:05:51.277
It's cancer.

02:05:51.965 --> 02:05:53.038
Only worse.

02:06:01.477 --> 02:06:02.529
What do we do now?

02:06:02.798 --> 02:06:04.982
We'll get inside, she'll find us.

02:07:54.915 --> 02:07:57.416
Well, well, well.

02:07:59.009 --> 02:08:00.068
Hi there.

02:08:00.787 --> 02:08:03.447
When it starts - run.

02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:06.632
Yes, you run, dear.

02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:09.074
And then I will find you,

02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:14.322
and you will scream
for years until you die.

02:08:15.297 --> 02:08:17.231
We'll see who does 
the screaming.

02:08:17.884 --> 02:08:19.404
We'll see indeed.

02:08:19.663 --> 02:08:20.941
She's right, you know.

02:08:21.728 --> 02:08:23.571
You should be afraid.

02:08:24.515 --> 02:08:26.136
Why is that?

02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:28.925
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

02:08:29.493 --> 02:08:32.417
I'm sorry, who are you, 
handsome?

02:08:36.007 --> 02:08:39.297
You are the one 
who killed my Crow, aren't you?

02:08:40.645 --> 02:08:41.737
Go!

02:09:43.028 --> 02:09:44.242
Clever.

02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:47.293
You've made some improvements, 
haven't you?

02:09:48.643 --> 02:09:50.982
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

02:09:51.281 --> 02:09:53.801
How do you know
we are not in yours?

02:10:07.847 --> 02:10:09.179
Where are you, pup?

02:10:29.839 --> 02:10:31.167
You gonna die here.

02:10:33.138 --> 02:10:34.646
Brave words, dear.

02:10:35.641 --> 02:10:37.371
Is that what you really think?

02:10:37.836 --> 02:10:40.232
You gonna hurt me?

02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:41.378
Yes.

02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:51.761
You know, 
you remind me of myself.

02:10:53.373 --> 02:10:54.904
I can really see it now.

02:10:55.699 --> 02:10:57.949
You've got a darkness in you, dear.

02:10:58.246 --> 02:11:01.705
But I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

02:11:11.321 --> 02:11:12.830
You don't know yet

02:11:13.730 --> 02:11:14.944
what you do

02:11:15.626 --> 02:11:16.696
for more time.

02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:22.134
But promise you, dear.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

02:11:27.319 --> 02:11:29.322
Pain purifies steam.

02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:34.404
Fear too, so...
You understand.

02:11:53.904 --> 02:11:56.394
I was just like you
when I was younger.

02:11:56.799 --> 02:11:58.295
So special

02:11:59.228 --> 02:12:00.363
and alone.

02:12:00.751 --> 02:12:03.731
But I met someone who gave me the gift  - 
the purpose of community.

02:12:03.731 --> 02:12:05.824
And I might've given you such a gift,

02:12:05.824 --> 02:12:08.822
if things would've gone differently.

02:12:11.917 --> 02:12:13.111
No?

02:12:13.924 --> 02:12:15.687
Defying, aren't you?

02:12:16.833 --> 02:12:21.253
So much like me,
your mind it's so...

02:12:24.014 --> 02:12:26.097
This isn't your mind, is it?

02:12:28.710 --> 02:12:31.079
This isn't you at all.

02:12:32.603 --> 02:12:35.058
You're just the bait?

02:12:38.455 --> 02:12:39.898
Enough!

02:12:42.725 --> 02:12:43.584
Run!

02:12:46.162 --> 02:12:48.538
How the hell did we miss you?

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:54.112
You and I 
should've met years ago.

02:12:57.819 --> 02:12:58.786
Danny?

02:12:59.953 --> 02:13:02.524
That's your name, isn't it?

02:13:03.895 --> 02:13:07.017
Well, something happens to the steam 
when your lubes get older.

02:13:07.444 --> 02:13:08.913
It gets polluted,

02:13:09.711 --> 02:13:11.165
dirty.

02:13:11.305 --> 02:13:12.369
You knew that?

02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:15.789
I see the grease all over you.

02:13:16.666 --> 02:13:19.404
You don't shine quite the same.

02:13:19.532 --> 02:13:22.083
Growing up spoils that, I guess.

02:13:24.119 --> 02:13:25.745
Seriously, handsome.

02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:28.798
Where have you been hiding?

02:13:31.878 --> 02:13:33.523
I can make you an offer.

02:13:35.095 --> 02:13:36.717
An offer I rarely make.

02:13:36.882 --> 02:13:39.142
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

02:13:39.467 --> 02:13:41.067
Such a gifted boy,

02:13:41.369 --> 02:13:44.664
hiding his light under bushwa 
for so long.

02:13:45.398 --> 02:13:48.903
You can live a long long time,
live well too.

02:13:49.811 --> 02:13:51.240
Indulge yourself.

02:13:51.907 --> 02:13:54.148
No consequences.

02:13:54.444 --> 02:13:56.164
No hangovers.

02:13:57.704 --> 02:14:00.219
Eat well, live long.

02:14:00.366 --> 02:14:02.835
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

02:14:03.174 --> 02:14:04.815
I mean the last one in the world.

02:14:05.375 --> 02:14:07.680
Sweetie, I'm not the last, 
far from it.

02:14:09.081 --> 02:14:10.609
I'm just the prettiest.

02:14:10.971 --> 02:14:12.690
I assume you know my answer.

02:14:14.607 --> 02:14:15.898
Pity.

02:14:15.944 --> 02:14:17.271
So, are we doing this or not?

02:14:38.246 --> 02:14:39.627
Oh, sweetie.

02:14:40.739 --> 02:14:42.669
Oh, look at that, huh?

02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:47.338
I seem to have nicked
your Femoral artery there.

02:14:48.348 --> 02:14:50.280
You gonna bleed to death, huh?

02:14:56.699 --> 02:14:58.724
My my, what a temper you have.

02:14:59.052 --> 02:15:00.391
So much fire.

02:15:00.806 --> 02:15:02.082
Such a waste!

02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:03.864
Or maybe not.

02:15:11.341 --> 02:15:12.288
Oh, damn.

02:15:13.610 --> 02:15:14.979
Even at your age.

02:15:15.808 --> 02:15:17.606
It's so good.

02:15:22.708 --> 02:15:24.760
You taste like whiskey.

02:15:30.183 --> 02:15:31.169
Danny!

02:15:32.283 --> 02:15:33.343
Danny boy!

02:15:35.338 --> 02:15:36.975
So much terror.

02:15:37.384 --> 02:15:38.937
All your life, huh?

02:15:41.578 --> 02:15:42.931
Delicious.

02:15:50.011 --> 02:15:51.194
Don't hurt me!

02:15:53.372 --> 02:15:54.467
Oh, damn.

02:15:58.926 --> 02:16:00.837
What, are not alone in there?

02:16:02.688 --> 02:16:03.820
What are you hiding, huh?

02:16:06.288 --> 02:16:07.396
What's in those?

02:16:07.971 --> 02:16:09.263
Something special, huh?

02:16:10.332 --> 02:16:11.730
They are not special.

02:16:11.894 --> 02:16:13.526
They are starving.

02:16:22.269 --> 02:16:22.967
No!

02:16:23.395 --> 02:16:24.654
No!

02:17:02.356 --> 02:17:04.356
Hello, Danny.

02:17:06.327 --> 02:17:08.050
Come and play with us.

02:17:09.844 --> 02:17:11.251
Forever

02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:13.855
and ever,

02:17:15.013 --> 02:17:16.900
and ever.

02:17:51.272 --> 02:17:52.374
Uncle Dan?

02:17:53.708 --> 02:17:55.424
Uncle Dan, is it done?

02:17:56.367 --> 02:17:57.784
Is she dead?

02:18:19.683 --> 02:18:21.607
Great party, isn't it?

02:18:22.096 --> 02:18:23.214
Abra!

02:18:27.145 --> 02:18:28.374
Abra!

02:18:44.967 --> 02:18:46.580
Abra!

02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:54.254
Abra!

02:19:12.675 --> 02:19:13.714
Try it.

02:19:16.958 --> 02:19:18.359
There you are.

02:19:18.643 --> 02:19:19.643
Abra.

02:19:21.013 --> 02:19:22.962
You've been very very bad.

02:19:23.553 --> 02:19:24.888
You are not Uncle Dan.

02:19:25.851 --> 02:19:28.701
You are a mask,
a false face.

02:19:30.101 --> 02:19:31.355
Who else could I be?

02:19:31.642 --> 02:19:34.425
You're The Hotel,
but he's still in there.

02:19:34.425 --> 02:19:36.352
Mask off then.

02:19:41.017 --> 02:19:42.518
Why are you smiling?

02:19:43.093 --> 02:19:45.120
Because you don't know 
where you're standing.

02:19:46.674 --> 02:19:48.926
I know these halls 
like my own face, child.

02:19:49.227 --> 02:19:51.358
I mean the body 
you're standing in.

02:19:51.542 --> 02:19:52.907
The face you're wearing.

02:19:53.282 --> 02:19:55.376
That's Dan Torrance, 
and you don't know him.

02:19:55.423 --> 02:19:56.996
Dan Torrance?

02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:58.562
Dan Torrance.

02:19:58.727 --> 02:20:01.604
Made one stop 
as soon as he got here -

02:20:01.746 --> 02:20:03.277
to the boiler room.

02:20:29.157 --> 02:20:30.352
There you are.

02:20:31.681 --> 02:20:33.044
You were supposed to run.

02:20:33.566 --> 02:20:35.164
I didn't wanna leave you.

02:20:38.015 --> 02:20:40.556
I'm exactly 
where I'm supposed to be.

02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.507
I can't hold it off for much longer,
Abra, you need to run.

02:20:44.658 --> 02:20:45.314
No!

02:20:45.627 --> 02:20:47.152
I'm not going anywhere without you.

02:20:47.646 --> 02:20:49.854
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

02:20:51.029 --> 02:20:52.315
Run, run!

02:23:06.897 --> 02:23:07.936
Come on, Uncle Dan.

02:23:08.571 --> 02:23:09.966
Get out of there.

02:23:11.139 --> 02:23:12.643
Come on.

02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:26.244
The fire spread fast,

02:23:26.542 --> 02:23:27.940
destroying the hotel.

02:23:28.592 --> 02:23:29.835
Purifying it.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:32.791
I could almost hear it

02:23:33.616 --> 02:23:34.876
screaming.

02:23:35.972 --> 02:23:37.744
I could hear it dying,

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:41.188
and deep inside I knew.

02:23:44.035 --> 02:23:45.958
I knew you were okay.

02:23:47.237 --> 02:23:49.300
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

02:23:50.265 --> 02:23:51.786
It was the only way.

02:23:52.598 --> 02:23:53.605
I know.

02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:58.259
Do you think she was right,

02:23:58.424 --> 02:24:00.793
when she said 
she wasn't the last one?

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:03.836
The world's the hungry place.

02:24:04.011 --> 02:24:05.691
A dark place.

02:24:06.617 --> 02:24:09.553
Maybe there're more of them,
or things like them or worse, but...

02:24:10.375 --> 02:24:12.824
There are more people like you too.

02:24:12.957 --> 02:24:14.616
People who stand.

02:24:18.236 --> 02:24:19.847
I told you, 
when I first met you

02:24:19.847 --> 02:24:22.623
I told you 
that you should hide.

02:24:24.159 --> 02:24:26.020
That you should
keep your head down.

02:24:27.295 --> 02:24:29.016
Keep your shine out of sight.

02:24:31.192 --> 02:24:32.428
But I was wrong.

02:24:35.802 --> 02:24:38.112
Shine on, Abra Stone.

02:24:40.562 --> 02:24:41.805
You shine on.

02:24:45.589 --> 02:24:46.642
Dinner's ready.

02:24:49.923 --> 02:24:51.776
Who were you talking to?

02:24:53.737 --> 02:24:54.716
No one.

02:25:02.849 --> 02:25:04.004
That's not true.

02:25:08.296 --> 02:25:09.787
I was talking to Dan.

02:25:17.722 --> 02:25:20.041
We go on, after.

02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:21.777
We go on.

02:25:22.473 --> 02:25:24.126
And he's okay.

02:25:24.865 --> 02:25:26.026
So is Daddy.

02:25:27.493 --> 02:25:29.034
He really is.

02:25:32.779 --> 02:25:34.245
Good.

02:25:45.661 --> 02:25:47.190
You're coming, sweetheart?

02:25:49.666 --> 02:25:50.955
In a minute.
