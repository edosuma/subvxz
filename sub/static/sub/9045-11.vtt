<i>Previously on</i> Awkward.

00:02.335 --> 00:04.254
<i>You could disappear
and no one would notice.</i>

00:04.420 --> 00:05.255
I like you,

00:05.421 --> 00:07.758
I'm just not sure
I'm ready to be in a relationship.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.801
I saw a girl get out
of Matty's truck.

00:09.967 --> 00:11.678
I think he's hooking up
with someone else.

00:11.844 --> 00:14.973
The reason I keep bringing up our kiss
is because I like like you.

00:16.056 --> 00:18.608
I don't want to be friends.
I want to be more.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.733
<i>Over the course of my life, there were
a few things I had learned to assume.</i>

00:25.406 --> 00:26.916
<i>If I was trying to look sexy,</i>

00:27.041 --> 00:29.237
<i>something would inevitably
be stuck in my teeth.</i>

00:29.700 --> 00:31.448
<i>Berry was not my friend.</i>

00:31.614 --> 00:34.856
<i>And if given the opportunity,
my mom would embarrass me.</i>

00:34.981 --> 00:37.120
Do you think this push-up bra
is doing its job?

00:37.286 --> 00:38.121
Yes,

00:38.287 --> 00:39.706
but just give it the day off.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.336
What is the single most important thing
we've learned from french women?

00:44.502 --> 00:46.046
Don't let your mom near your face?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.781
Always put up your best feature.

00:47.906 --> 00:50.217
And since you refuse
to show off your belly.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.959
We'll have to go with your lips.

00:52.593 --> 00:54.234
- Rub it together.
- Nice lips.

00:54.359 --> 00:56.534
<i>One thing
I didn't have to assume anymore,</i>

00:56.912 --> 00:58.683
<i>my status with Matty.</i>

00:59.100 --> 01:00.883
<i>We were clearly together.</i>

01:01.008 --> 01:03.480
<i>And he was not a vegetarian.</i>

01:04.349 --> 01:05.357
Stop it.

01:05.887 --> 01:08.235
You think he's gonna ask you
to formal?

01:09.177 --> 01:10.237
Jeez Louise.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.571
This is a barbecue.

01:13.011 --> 01:15.325
Who put out the formal... napkins?

01:16.361 --> 01:17.703
So good.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.705
So, what color of dress
are you wearing at the dance?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.179
- Peach.
- Black.

01:21.651 --> 01:23.959
- Peach.
- Son, I know you're a good kid.

01:24.631 --> 01:27.003
Even though
Jenna's still my little girl,

01:27.169 --> 01:28.422
I want her to have fun.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.816
<i>Thankfully,
my dad always had my back.</i>

01:31.424 --> 01:33.576
I'm not pushing anything, but...

01:33.701 --> 01:36.346
if you guys decide to take things
to the next level,

01:36.512 --> 01:38.306
make sure you wrap up the sausage.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.562
<i>Assumption was the mother
of all screw-ups.</i>

01:43.728 --> 01:45.263
<i>Suicide Club</i> presents:

01:45.388 --> 01:47.649
<i>1x11 - Fateful -</i>

01:54.707 --> 01:56.840
What's up with the lip statement?

01:56.965 --> 01:58.668
I'm just trying something new.

01:58.793 --> 02:00.704
<i>I was no longer that girl.</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:02.080
<i>I was Matty's girl.</i>

02:02.246 --> 02:04.499
<i>And as such, I had to look the part.</i>

02:04.665 --> 02:05.834
It's totally bumass.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.366
We're just not used to being able to see
your lips from across the quad.

02:10.614 --> 02:11.506
Greena.

02:12.055 --> 02:14.155
I want to go to formal with you.

02:16.510 --> 02:18.138
My parents suck.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.151
When I tried to tell them that formals
were American tradition,

02:21.276 --> 02:23.100
"We are Chinese!"

02:23.225 --> 02:25.437
"Chinese people love to party!"

02:25.603 --> 02:29.232
They didn't become a billion-strong
by hanging out in the library.

02:29.398 --> 02:31.809
A week go, I'd have been uber clummed
to go with Ricky Schwartz.

02:32.526 --> 02:35.405
But know I'm like la de freakin' da.
I'm so over that jackrad.

02:36.082 --> 02:37.908
Can't believe I'm the only one going.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.886
Matty asked you?

02:40.011 --> 02:42.397
- When? Where?
- We want the full play by play.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.516
It wasn't an official invite, but he asked for
the color of the dress I was wearing.

02:45.641 --> 02:48.210
So it's basically the same thing.
<i>It wasn't.</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:51.859
<i>But in the 168 hours
since I became Matty's girl</i>

02:51.984 --> 02:53.874
<i>I had grown used to his known
non-sense style.</i>

02:53.999 --> 02:55.582
Someone's getting an invite!

02:58.719 --> 03:00.066
That's for you, T.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.351
What do you say, gorgeous?

03:05.823 --> 03:07.354
I got nothing else to do.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.206
<i>Even though I was going at Matty,
I had to admit,</i>

03:13.859 --> 03:15.791
<i>I'd have been down
with a cheestastic invite.</i>

03:15.916 --> 03:18.156
Will you go to formal with me, Erin?

03:18.513 --> 03:19.783
That's lame.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.789
You realize that'll probably go bad
by lunch, right?

03:28.874 --> 03:30.248
I'm willing to risk it.

03:32.538 --> 03:34.309
I forgot to ask you something.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.369
Are you a limo girl?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.260
<i>So it wasn't the big ask.</i>

03:38.426 --> 03:40.571
<i>But I was definitely a limo girl.</i>

03:40.696 --> 03:43.348
- I'm cool with whatever.
- So it's cool if we just take my truck?

03:45.057 --> 03:46.226
That slut pole.

03:47.570 --> 03:49.170
There's Marcus, g-bye!

03:50.313 --> 03:52.399
As your friend,
it's my job to tell you

03:52.565 --> 03:54.431
your plan is retarded.

03:54.556 --> 03:56.236
You always say that about my plans

03:56.695 --> 03:58.639
but this one is genie in a bottle.

03:58.764 --> 04:02.118
If Jake sees me with Marcus, he'll get
so jealous and will ask me to formal.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.076
And then,

04:03.242 --> 04:04.536
fingers crossed,

04:04.702 --> 04:06.235
punch Marcus in the face.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.540
I've always wanted two guys
to fight over me.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.709
LE!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.466
Melanie will not go
to formal with you.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.051
Wake up and smell the body spray!

04:21.176 --> 04:23.180
Clark is gay!

04:24.305 --> 04:25.555
You're welcome!

04:30.072 --> 04:32.480
Yeah, the test was brutal...
I'll see you.

04:33.455 --> 04:35.719
Put your fingers through my hair
and tell me that I'm pretty.

04:35.844 --> 04:36.852
You're pretty.

04:38.986 --> 04:40.472
I got something for you.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.240
It's the new single from Watson 66.

04:42.895 --> 04:45.911
Let's Dance? Please tell me it's not
another bad cover of Bowie.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.355
Keep reading.

04:50.289 --> 04:51.583
I already have a date.

04:53.678 --> 04:54.628
Okay...

04:57.534 --> 04:58.965
He's a lucky guy.

05:00.815 --> 05:01.862
I gotta go.

05:07.139 --> 05:08.475
Screw formal.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.471
What?

05:10.009 --> 05:12.854
I got the heisman from Jenna.
I thought she was into me.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.044
Do you know who she's going with?

05:17.540 --> 05:18.694
No. Sorry, man.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.779
- Did you ask anyone yet?
- Not exactly.

05:21.869 --> 05:24.172
Pull it off.
Let's get drunk.

05:24.606 --> 05:25.911
Blow it off.
Let's get drunk.

05:26.036 --> 05:27.257
All right, dude, fine.

05:27.547 --> 05:31.787
Leave me all alone on a Saturday night
wallowing in a pool of my own bloodin' vomit.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.530
That's real cool.

05:34.749 --> 05:37.428
Now, I do believe you're happy.
You look happy.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.643
Unless you're high.

05:39.988 --> 05:41.838
Have you been rocking the gange, J.?

05:41.963 --> 05:45.387
No, it's just that for once
my life is pretty good and...

05:46.326 --> 05:48.890
And you wanted to thank me.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.810
And I have a boyfriend.

05:52.398 --> 05:55.063
We're soul sisters.
I have a boyfriend too.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.398
Who is he?

05:57.153 --> 05:58.424
No one you know.

05:58.698 --> 06:02.320
He doesn't work at the school here or anything.
That would be grounds for dismissal.

06:02.809 --> 06:04.281
No, he's a...

06:06.079 --> 06:07.200
Farmer.

06:07.366 --> 06:08.618
He's a farmer.

06:08.784 --> 06:11.121
Farmer Bob McDonald.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.747
Okay. I was just asking.

06:13.701 --> 06:16.334
Look at how much progress we've made

06:16.500 --> 06:17.752
in just a few short months.

06:18.175 --> 06:21.075
See,
here is when you got this nasty letter.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.800
This is
when you wore the cameltoe pants.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.302
Those were really dark ages.

06:25.713 --> 06:29.305
Isn't it funny how it almost seems
that your incident was an accident?

06:29.471 --> 06:31.266
It was an accident.

06:32.765 --> 06:33.560
Exactly.

06:34.334 --> 06:36.146
Anywho,
now that you're in your renaissance,

06:36.626 --> 06:38.944
I thought you could choose
your own happy sticker.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.442
I can see you're busy, Val.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.943
I won't come back later.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.778
- No. You, stay.
- Her?

06:43.944 --> 06:45.238
- Me?
- You.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.448
I'll go.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.409
So glad you have a boyfriend, J.!

06:49.575 --> 06:50.952
Way to be normal.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.165
You have two minutes.

06:56.056 --> 06:58.418
I've received
several complaints about you today.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.920
Now,
I know this is falling on deaf ears

07:01.086 --> 07:03.086
but you can't ruin formal
for your fellow students.

07:03.211 --> 07:05.508
More importantly,
you cannot out people.

07:05.674 --> 07:06.741
Please.

07:06.866 --> 07:09.421
When Clarke Stevenson
busted out that pink feathered backpack,

07:09.546 --> 07:10.638
he outed himself.

07:11.286 --> 07:12.891
Melanie should be thanking me.

07:13.057 --> 07:17.520
Of all people, you should understand
how painful it is to be someone's beard.

07:17.971 --> 07:18.972
It is.

07:19.396 --> 07:20.994
Think of you had
someone like me helping you.

07:21.119 --> 07:24.569
You might have been spared
all that heartache and humiliation.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.894
Well, hello, Mr Mischra.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.014
You are correct.
I am in session.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.660
Stop!

07:42.172 --> 07:43.276
No, you stop.

07:44.036 --> 07:45.715
Oh yeah. Yeah.
Well.

07:49.126 --> 07:50.512
I'm hanging up now.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.182
Official school business.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.520
Miss Marks,

07:55.643 --> 07:58.520
while you were on the phone, I've had
time to reflect on the error of my ways.

07:59.716 --> 08:01.940
I don't know
where I'd be without your guidance.

08:03.555 --> 08:04.692
Thank you.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.652
Can you believe how awesometown
Ricky's ask was?

08:09.777 --> 08:11.282
He put so much thought into it.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.160
Sorry.

08:14.326 --> 08:17.934
Am I bragging too much,
considering Matty didn't go all out?

08:18.059 --> 08:18.942
Brag away.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.288
All I care about is
that Matty and I are going together.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.821
The rest of that stuff is just fluff.

08:22.946 --> 08:24.212
Congrats, princess Jenna.

08:25.229 --> 08:27.671
I heard you're on the ballot
for winter formal.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.928
This is a major major.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.097
- Where are you going?
- To tell Ming!

08:37.214 --> 08:40.352
I was just nominated
for sophomore winter formal princess.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.649
Listen. I'm gonna need
to go get a really great dress.

08:45.015 --> 08:47.026
<i>You think
we can do that after school?</i>

08:47.804 --> 08:49.696
<i>Taking that as a yes.</i>

08:51.071 --> 08:52.031
That's a yes.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.534
I am getting a head start
and surprising her with options.

08:55.437 --> 08:58.746
I'm so sorry Lapita,
you're gonna do all the cleaning today.

09:01.665 --> 09:03.293
I always do all the cleaning.

09:08.213 --> 09:10.806
<i>It was the first time
I didn't mind people staring</i>

09:10.931 --> 09:12.635
<i>because it was for the right reasons.</i>

09:13.254 --> 09:16.639
- <i>They admired me.</i>
- I see they printed up new ballots.

09:16.805 --> 09:19.184
Apparently,
there was some last minute changes.

09:26.252 --> 09:28.151
Let me guess.
You're voting for yourself.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.226
At least, you'll get one vote.

09:37.251 --> 09:38.495
<i>As you are now,</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:40.538
<i>you could disappear
and no one would notice.</i>

09:41.413 --> 09:43.416
<i>So not true.
I couldn't disappear.</i>

09:46.502 --> 09:48.188
<i>How did somebody get my letter?</i>

09:50.275 --> 09:52.967
<i>I had assumed my rep as a suicide case
was all but dead.</i>

09:54.843 --> 09:57.672
<i>Your instincts suck.</i>

09:57.797 --> 09:59.182
<i>Second guess them.</i>

09:59.348 --> 10:00.350
<i>Number 4:</i>

10:00.516 --> 10:04.187
When you're pretty you're happy
and clearly you're not happy.

10:06.021 --> 10:08.391
Nobody likes the pitiful.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.318
Stop being such a drag.

10:11.238 --> 10:12.445
But my stigma was alive.

10:15.446 --> 10:17.249
And kicking me in the ass.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.413 --> 10:37.804
Make out with me.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.222
No way.

10:46.001 --> 10:47.021
Dude!

10:50.423 --> 10:51.276
You're okay?

10:51.442 --> 10:53.861
You're sure you want to be seen
with the biggest looser in school?

10:54.027 --> 10:56.281
The person who wrote the letter
is a looser, not you.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.860
I thought I already have been
through the worst day of my life,

10:58.985 --> 11:01.390
it turns out it was just a warm up.

11:01.515 --> 11:03.145
Think you're having a bad day.

11:03.839 --> 11:06.624
I put myself out there,
asked a girl to formal

11:06.790 --> 11:07.890
she said no,

11:09.576 --> 11:11.856
Forget about her,
cause she is a bitch.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.298
A raging bitch.

11:13.915 --> 11:16.634
The guy she is going with
has man boobs.

11:18.093 --> 11:19.679
Who are you going with?

11:19.845 --> 11:21.055
<i>It was weird.</i>

11:21.221 --> 11:23.309
<i>Matty still hadn't told Jake
about us.</i>

11:23.434 --> 11:25.151
I'm not even sure
I want to go anymore.

11:25.276 --> 11:28.438
But then who's gonna wear the crown
when you win sophomore princess?

11:28.604 --> 11:31.149
- Like that's gonna happen.
- I voted for you.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.360
I mean, I wouldn't have
but I did it before you turned me down.

11:35.707 --> 11:38.031
- What are you gonna do for about the letter?
- Nothing.

11:39.121 --> 11:40.867
The damage has already been done.

11:48.045 --> 11:49.459
Listen, I've been thinking,

11:49.625 --> 11:52.545
what if we blow off the dances
and do something else instead?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.047
Dances are pretty lame, right?

11:59.301 --> 12:00.178
Is that okay?

12:01.002 --> 12:03.848
- Sure.
- Great, meet you at my truck after school.

12:08.268 --> 12:10.861
<i>How could I be Matty's girl
when I was still his secret?</i>

12:11.847 --> 12:13.684
<i>Because I was that girl,</i>

12:13.809 --> 12:16.286
<i>who never stood a chance
of going to the formal.</i>

12:16.411 --> 12:17.891
Just look at the label.

12:18.016 --> 12:20.698
Someone was spreading the rumor
at lunch, but I didn't believe it.

12:21.255 --> 12:23.951
- Until now.
- You were the back up invite?

12:24.117 --> 12:26.029
No, I wasn't just the back up,

12:26.154 --> 12:28.998
I was sloppy fourth.

12:29.164 --> 12:31.584
- I'm sorry, T.
- Are you still gonna go?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.073
Over his dead body.

12:33.198 --> 12:35.254
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm not going either.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.062
- Why not?
- Have you seen the ballots?

12:38.701 --> 12:39.675
I'm so sorry,

12:39.841 --> 12:41.712
I was so caught up
in this Ricky's scandal

12:41.837 --> 12:44.055
I forgot to vote for you.

12:45.471 --> 12:46.432
Holy shit!

12:47.474 --> 12:50.753
What kind of monster
would do something so Resident Evil?

12:52.916 --> 12:55.358
I'm talking to my friends.

12:57.901 --> 13:00.679
I know you did this,
and your ass is grass.

13:00.804 --> 13:01.908
What's the matter?

13:02.033 --> 13:04.248
Did you drink some bad soy milk
this morning?

13:04.373 --> 13:08.029
Stealing someone's personal file
is not only morally corrupt,

13:08.154 --> 13:10.039
it's punishable by expulsion.

13:10.205 --> 13:13.835
And I don't give a hot damn
if your dad built the planetarium.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.088
- This time, there will be consequences.
- You're not going to expel me, are you?

13:17.947 --> 13:19.709
Maybe.
Maybe not.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.635
But as far as winter formal's concerned,
you won't be going.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.429
But I already have...

13:24.595 --> 13:27.495
Grab that file
and follow me back to my office.

13:29.552 --> 13:30.357
Good.

13:30.482 --> 13:33.177
Just wanted to be sure
you were following me.

13:34.707 --> 13:36.732
Welcome to Karmageddon, bitch.

13:39.139 --> 13:40.403
Ricky Schwart's sighting.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.030
- What are you going to do?
- Tell him to go fuck himself.

13:43.196 --> 13:45.950
I will never be anyone's number 4.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.108
I deserve better.

13:47.233 --> 13:50.163
I would rather stay home Saturday night,
giving my cat a manicure,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.435
than go to the dance with that idiot.

13:56.454 --> 13:58.212
<i>Tamara did deserve better,</i>

13:58.378 --> 14:00.089
<i>and she wasn't the only one.</i>

14:03.328 --> 14:04.510
It's all over.

14:04.963 --> 14:06.929
I told him to take care.

14:07.095 --> 14:10.224
There is no recovery from that.
I got to walk it off.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.997
- I don't need a ride.
- Is your mom picking you up?

14:33.940 --> 14:36.000
I would just rather walk home
than go with you.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.045
- Why?
- Because.

14:39.685 --> 14:41.714
I really want to go
to the damn formal.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.084
And I want a limo, and I want you
to dress up in a gorilla suit.

14:45.209 --> 14:46.883
Or surprise me with balloons,

14:47.008 --> 14:49.931
or jump out of a coffin,
I don't know.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.659
Maybe not the coffin,
but I want the big ask.

14:52.784 --> 14:54.685
I don't care if you think it's lame.
It is lame.

14:54.851 --> 14:57.355
I want to take you.
Your invite is here. Look!

14:57.521 --> 14:59.524
I was going to ask you at lunch,
but then, Jake...

14:59.690 --> 15:01.859
- Why haven't you told him?
- I tried to, but he...

15:01.984 --> 15:03.444
But what?

15:03.610 --> 15:04.611
Nothing.

15:05.645 --> 15:06.647
Not possible.

15:06.772 --> 15:07.773
Take care.

15:17.735 --> 15:18.626
Don't think,

15:18.962 --> 15:21.045
just go with your first instinct!

15:21.714 --> 15:23.631
Which dress
jumps out at you the most?

15:24.330 --> 15:25.132
None.

15:25.298 --> 15:28.010
But... you have no idea
how great they look on.

15:28.398 --> 15:29.428
On who?

15:29.594 --> 15:30.451
Me.

15:30.576 --> 15:33.097
But I was the only one available
to try them on.

15:33.598 --> 15:34.870
Of course.

15:35.308 --> 15:37.645
'Cause you couldn't wait to see
what I wanted.

15:38.287 --> 15:40.231
There's only one person in this room
who looks good in peach,

15:40.397 --> 15:41.691
and who might that be?

15:47.404 --> 15:49.323
But this dress,
it will look really pretty on you.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.617
We just have
to stuff the bust a little.

15:52.390 --> 15:54.412
I'm not going to formal,
I don't have a date,

15:54.578 --> 15:56.168
and my nomination was a joke.

16:06.678 --> 16:09.176
Prep your fire zone,
you have blopped guys sixteen times.

16:09.342 --> 16:11.147
'Cause I got the crappy controller.

16:15.033 --> 16:17.169
Dude, can you at least
try not to suck so much?

16:17.294 --> 16:19.979
Yeah, I do suck.
That's probably why Jenna rejected me.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.773
You're still talking about it...
You've been bitching about it all day.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.867
Jenna doesn't like you, okay?

16:26.649 --> 16:28.988
- Get over her already.
- What the hell is your problem?

16:29.458 --> 16:31.688
- I can't play, fuck you.
- Then why am I even here?

16:31.813 --> 16:33.117
To be a pain in my ass?

16:34.416 --> 16:36.871
When you'll stop PMSing,
don't bother calling me.

16:37.037 --> 16:37.955
Yeah, I won't.

16:58.638 --> 17:01.952
<i>I had taken great care
to be the daughter my mom always wanted,</i>

17:02.326 --> 17:04.444
<i>and the girl Matty wanted to be with,</i>

17:05.655 --> 17:08.319
<i>but along the way,
I lost sight of myself.</i>

17:08.789 --> 17:10.723
<i>It was time to take care of me.</i>

17:11.420 --> 17:13.810
<i>And I wasn't going to sit around
and cry about it.</i>

17:14.782 --> 17:16.205
<i>Okay, maybe a little.</i>

17:22.290 --> 17:24.001
Do you have any TP?

17:24.848 --> 17:26.796
Use these.

17:27.535 --> 17:28.873
Ever been

17:28.998 --> 17:31.842
so into a guy
you thought was into you,

17:32.008 --> 17:34.261
only to find out
he's into someone else?

17:34.890 --> 17:37.923
Actually, three someone elses!

17:38.515 --> 17:40.498
Wait, are you that girl

17:40.623 --> 17:42.309
with red frizzy hair,

17:42.434 --> 17:44.647
who always wears overalls?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.715
That's Leslie Gainer!

17:46.840 --> 17:48.234
Good, 'cause she...

17:48.980 --> 17:51.630
is seriously nuts, jeez!

17:52.070 --> 17:53.989
I know! She smells like...

17:54.155 --> 17:56.367
A litter box!

18:01.621 --> 18:03.069
Can I give you a hug?

18:03.665 --> 18:05.376
I'm not really a hugger.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.859
It's okay,

18:06.984 --> 18:09.097
- I'll do all the work.
- All right.

18:17.761 --> 18:18.762
Bitch!

18:36.768 --> 18:38.824
This is Marcus,
we're going to formal together.

18:38.949 --> 18:41.409
- Hello, Marcus. What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?

18:41.864 --> 18:43.935
- Why are you hugging?
- 'Cause we're bros.

18:44.060 --> 18:45.287
No hugging!

18:46.565 --> 18:47.752
What's wrong with hugs?

18:47.918 --> 18:49.253
Are you okay, T?

18:49.419 --> 18:50.838
- Were you crying?
- No.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.851
I was ugly crying,
but I got it out of my system.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.835
Be right back.

19:06.762 --> 19:08.238
I've been looking for you.

19:10.675 --> 19:12.193
We should go to the dance together.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.989
- If you still wanna go.
- What happened to your date?

19:20.110 --> 19:21.160
Didn't work out.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.589
It just happens
you have a little competition.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.290
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.500
With my mum.

19:28.573 --> 19:30.489
We're gonna catch a movie,

19:30.614 --> 19:33.881
a little mother-son action,
but I think I could blow her off.

19:34.642 --> 19:36.978
I've been seeing a lot of her lately,
and...

19:37.345 --> 19:39.453
I think it's time for us
to take a break.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.700
Okay, gross.

19:42.107 --> 19:43.099
I'm in.

19:43.629 --> 19:45.247
I just need to know one thing.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.770
How's your dress?

19:48.218 --> 19:49.219
Not peach.

19:51.532 --> 19:53.109
<i>I was leaving my Renaissance</i>

19:53.275 --> 19:54.860
<i>and heading into my Golden Age.</i>

19:55.391 --> 19:57.530
<i>'Cause I wasn't that girl anymore,</i>

19:57.696 --> 19:59.824
<i>and I wasn't Matty's girl neither.</i>

20:07.254 --> 20:10.180
<i>I was Jenna Hamilton.</i>

20:15.297 --> 20:17.281
<i>Someone once said that it's choice</i>

20:17.406 --> 20:18.380
<i>not chance,</i>

20:18.505 --> 20:20.075
<i>that determines our destiny.</i>

20:20.582 --> 20:23.190
<i>My head made the choice
to end things with Matty</i>

20:23.315 --> 20:24.393
<i>but my heart,</i>

20:24.518 --> 20:27.101
<i>my heart was still waiting for
the chance that my head might...</i>

20:28.513 --> 20:29.353
<i>reconsider.</i>

20:31.806 --> 20:34.400
- What are you doing here?
- I need you to know something.

20:34.748 --> 20:35.943
Okay, I'm listening.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.453
I love you.

20:53.338 --> 20:55.070
I really love you.

20:55.741 --> 20:56.422
What?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.048
It's okay. We can share.

20:58.214 --> 21:00.718
- You don't have to choose.
- Because we can all share.

21:02.965 --> 21:04.462
This isn't real.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.375
This isn't real.

21:06.736 --> 21:07.737
This isn't real.

21:08.137 --> 21:09.518
The ad does seem fake,

21:10.377 --> 21:12.563
and creepy.
"We can all share."

21:12.729 --> 21:14.103
Who wants that?

21:14.771 --> 21:17.096
- What are you reading?
- The missed connections in our area.

21:17.221 --> 21:19.712
I'm seeing if anyone was too shy
to ask me to the formal.

21:19.837 --> 21:21.989
But this site is
clearly only for pervs.

21:22.346 --> 21:25.378
God, can you imagine, bumping uglies
while others people watch?

21:25.503 --> 21:27.369
I can.
And it's disturbing.

21:27.535 --> 21:29.005
Are you excited for tonight?

21:29.329 --> 21:32.128
I can't believe you're going
to your first formal without me.

21:32.253 --> 21:34.360
I know.
It's not going to be the same.

21:34.485 --> 21:37.784
Wait, listen to this.
"I've blown it over and over again.

21:37.909 --> 21:41.054
But if you give me one last chance,
I'll sweep you off your feet on the dancefloor

21:41.179 --> 21:42.715
"And finally be your guy".

21:42.840 --> 21:45.095
- Doesn't that sound like Ricky?
- Or Matty.

21:45.837 --> 21:47.348
Don't do this to yourself.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.679
If Matty had any gonads,
he'd fight for you.

21:49.804 --> 21:51.227
But he doesn't and he didn't.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.604
Do you think destiny
is determined by chance or choice?

21:53.770 --> 21:55.189
Chance, 100%.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.378
If destiny was by choice, I'd have
developed an ass, instead of a mustache.

21:58.503 --> 22:00.236
But I'm the one
who ended things with Matty.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.155
Maybe I misdirected faith
and missed my connection to be with him.

22:03.469 --> 22:05.056
Okay, you're getting really deep,

22:05.181 --> 22:08.836
and it's far too early for me to process
anything more than your morning breath,

22:08.961 --> 22:10.955
which by the way is rank.

22:13.285 --> 22:14.873
<i>Did I screw up my destiny,</i>

22:15.359 --> 22:17.272
<i>or was my fate supposed to stink?</i>

22:19.629 --> 22:20.981
<i>Suicide Club</i> presents:

22:21.340 --> 22:22.766
<i>1x12 - I Am Jenna Hamilton -</i>

22:23.660 --> 22:25.789
I'm thinking I want to wear my hair...

22:26.068 --> 22:27.069
- Up.
- Down.

22:27.997 --> 22:29.297
Honey, your hair

22:29.422 --> 22:31.892
is the best weapon
in the fight against your heritage.

22:32.567 --> 22:35.062
Princesses don't have big ears.

22:35.504 --> 22:38.515
Jenna's been nominated
for sophmore winter princess.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.815
I'd like it up.

22:40.410 --> 22:43.387
With all that hair on top
you're just gonna look like a bobblehead.

22:43.676 --> 22:44.672
Good.

22:46.643 --> 22:49.152
Bad news.
I just got off the phone with Ming.

22:49.277 --> 22:50.744
- She's going tonight.
- With who she's with?

22:50.910 --> 22:52.746
She said it's a surprise.

22:52.912 --> 22:55.290
This sucks.
Now I'm gonna be alone losering.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.084
Why don't you come
with me and Jake?

22:57.250 --> 22:59.378
- I'm not a date crasher.
- We're going as friends.

22:59.701 --> 23:02.339
I definitely add some sauce
to the mix.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.596
<i>I already know.</i>

23:09.762 --> 23:11.306
We can't wear the same color dress.

23:11.472 --> 23:12.307
Good call.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.645
Can Tamara come with us?
She doesn't have a date and...

23:17.344 --> 23:18.480
Sure.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.149
<i>I'll see you at 6.</i>

23:22.498 --> 23:23.395
Anyone here

23:23.520 --> 23:26.739
who can do something in the vein of
Grecian goddess meets Gaga?

23:27.613 --> 23:28.791
Let me drop for you.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.454
<i>With T. by my side, a good time
at the dance was all but in the cards.</i>

23:37.032 --> 23:38.667
Poker is not my game.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.794
Poke-her?
But I don't even know her.

23:43.918 --> 23:45.549
You guys are like Brainchilds.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.800
Dude,

23:46.966 --> 23:48.344
call her already.

23:50.247 --> 23:52.431
Does Mclight have a girlfriend?

23:52.597 --> 23:53.348
He did.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.103
You get your ass handed to you
or what?

23:58.269 --> 24:00.481
- It wasn't really my fault.
- It's never our fault.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.817
But you still got to own up to whatever
you think that she thinks that you did.

24:03.983 --> 24:06.047
I think she wants me to leave her alone.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.198
Dude are you a wuss?
I seriously want to punch you right now.

24:09.553 --> 24:10.824
She told me to take care.

24:12.547 --> 24:14.983
When she said it,
was she looking directly at you

24:15.574 --> 24:16.747
or was she like...

24:16.872 --> 24:18.157
looking at the ground,

24:18.669 --> 24:19.779
twirling her hair?

24:19.904 --> 24:22.284
The hair twirl?
Signature tell.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.879
It was pretty direct.

24:25.838 --> 24:28.759
Give her something she wants.

24:30.118 --> 24:31.929
She wants to go to the formal.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.186
- Take her.
- I can't, the formal istonight.

24:34.311 --> 24:35.474
So make it happen.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.476
You're a McKibben,
McKibbens are winners.

24:40.267 --> 24:41.647
You're right, we are winners.

24:41.985 --> 24:43.925
Flush beats your straight.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.219
- What happened?
- Me!

24:48.344 --> 24:50.344
I can't go anywhere like this.

24:50.998 --> 24:52.241
Don't panic!

24:53.684 --> 24:55.160
We can fix your head.

24:55.326 --> 24:56.607
Yeah, but you can't fix my dress.

24:56.732 --> 24:58.122
You were right, it's awful.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.164
Happy?

24:59.910 --> 25:02.418
A little, but don't fret.
Come on.

25:05.747 --> 25:08.215
There's nothing in your closet
I'm gonna wanna wear.

25:09.032 --> 25:12.386
- What about this?
- You'd let me wearing this dress?

25:12.552 --> 25:15.556
Special times
call for special circumstances.

25:16.848 --> 25:17.808
Try it on.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.647
You know,

25:23.813 --> 25:24.944
that dress

25:25.069 --> 25:28.581
was specially made for Nana
when she was a model.

25:30.993 --> 25:32.525
I used to think if

25:33.294 --> 25:35.220
I could look as good as her in it,

25:35.345 --> 25:38.338
that she would love me
as much she loved that dress.

25:39.802 --> 25:41.379
- Isn't that silly?
- Yes.

25:41.504 --> 25:44.367
The only time she ever let me wear it
was to my prom.

25:44.996 --> 25:46.757
You should have seen me trying to

25:46.882 --> 25:50.254
fit my big ass pregnant belly
into that

25:50.732 --> 25:51.733
tiny...

25:54.831 --> 25:56.181
Do I look stupid?

25:57.229 --> 25:58.279
You look...

25:59.596 --> 26:00.597
perfect.

26:03.436 --> 26:04.986
I want you to know...

26:05.797 --> 26:07.733
that I would never love a dress
more than you.

26:09.108 --> 26:10.569
Unless it's vintage Chanel.

26:11.679 --> 26:12.779
Understandable.

26:15.751 --> 26:17.651
You are the best part of me.

26:19.148 --> 26:20.748
Because you're not me.

26:22.089 --> 26:23.165
You are better.

26:27.472 --> 26:29.087
I'm so sorry.

26:30.206 --> 26:31.207
Mom...

26:31.764 --> 26:32.926
I can't breathe.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.201
Gotta let go.

26:34.752 --> 26:36.179
I'm sorry, I was just...

26:36.705 --> 26:38.005
having a moment.

26:38.621 --> 26:40.510
I am entitled one on occasion

26:40.635 --> 26:42.753
considering you've ruined my figure.

26:48.021 --> 26:49.955
Do you think
you were meant to be with dad?

26:51.238 --> 26:53.654
I mean if I wasn't here,
would you have chosen him?

26:55.253 --> 26:56.448
There was never choice.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.238
The girls are here.

27:06.194 --> 27:08.986
<i>If I wasn't going
to let fate influence my decisions,</i>

27:10.047 --> 27:12.547
<i>I wouldn't let
some vile letter do it either.</i>

27:14.326 --> 27:16.650
<i>It was time to put my past
where it belonged.</i>

27:18.297 --> 27:19.221
<i>In the past.</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:27.085
Ming's going with Vera.

27:27.543 --> 27:29.815
- Surprise!
- Hi.

27:31.307 --> 27:32.808
Give me a sidebar.

27:34.745 --> 27:36.446
Is there something you wanna tell me?

27:36.612 --> 27:39.965
'Cause I'm pretty sure
Vera is of the Ellen variety.

27:40.984 --> 27:43.233
Going with a girl friend

27:43.505 --> 27:46.066
was the only way
my parents would let me go.

27:46.191 --> 27:49.774
So, if I have to let her
fill me up at the end of the night,

27:49.899 --> 27:51.474
I'm done for the cause.

27:51.599 --> 27:53.213
Girls, get together.

28:01.475 --> 28:03.862
Chins out and down.

28:07.783 --> 28:10.022
Dad, I think your allergies
are acting up again.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.982
No, I'm crying.

28:14.062 --> 28:15.861
Damn you, 'cause now I'm crying.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.696
Can you believe we did this?

28:19.094 --> 28:20.803
We raised a beautiful girl.

28:22.549 --> 28:23.910
You're embarrassing Jenna.

28:24.076 --> 28:25.495
You're both embarrassing Jenna.

28:27.417 --> 28:28.947
It's your date!

28:30.625 --> 28:31.626
Thanks.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.217
Can I please speak to Jenna?

28:34.342 --> 28:35.453
You just missed her.

28:35.578 --> 28:37.549
She's on her way to the formal
with her friends.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.261
Thank you.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.139
You're good.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.956
You might wanna rethink
the lambskin rubber in your bag.

28:47.081 --> 28:48.494
They don't really work.

28:52.813 --> 28:54.363
I knew it, that little...

28:54.921 --> 28:56.688
You are "verboten" from this dance,

28:56.813 --> 28:59.780
"verboten" for looking so fabulous.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.783
Kitten, you need to relax.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.535
I know, it's just
Sadie always undercuts my authority,

29:05.701 --> 29:07.287
and I just know she's gonna crash.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.207
- Kitten?
- Too soon?

29:10.373 --> 29:12.918
Not at all, my velvet vindaloo.

29:15.557 --> 29:16.463
Go, go in.

29:19.069 --> 29:21.107
J, my girl, look at you!

29:22.034 --> 29:24.681
I didn't know Rosati was the guy
you've been telling me about.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.098
Jake's my date.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.308
Alright, you two lovebirds
have a good time.

29:28.853 --> 29:32.020
But watch the bump and grind.
We're trying to keep this shindig PG.

29:33.454 --> 29:34.606
Good.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.423
Principal Cox
wants to discuss the dress code.

29:37.548 --> 29:40.459
I know, some of these kids
are really pushing the boundaries.

29:40.835 --> 29:42.271
He was talking about you.

29:44.609 --> 29:46.618
- I wore this to my grandma's funeral.
- I know.

29:46.784 --> 29:47.953
Dork alert.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.883
We're here way too early.

29:50.008 --> 29:52.239
Ms Hamilton, allow me to educate you.

29:52.364 --> 29:53.901
It's all about arriving early.

29:54.026 --> 29:57.045
That way we get our pictures taken before
we ruin our hair out on the dancefloor.

29:57.550 --> 29:59.089
- You're gonna dance.
- Ladies,

29:59.255 --> 30:01.466
prepare yourselves,
I like to rip it up

30:01.954 --> 30:03.593
and it ain't pretty.

30:03.921 --> 30:06.638
<i>Unlike Matty,
Jake wasn't afraid to be a dork.</i>

30:07.088 --> 30:08.974
<i>And I was ready to dork out with him.</i>

30:16.820 --> 30:19.142
Do you think I can get one
just the two of us?

30:30.418 --> 30:31.771
I'll be right back.

30:34.074 --> 30:37.002
Don't yank me.
My dress is couture.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.894
I'm doing the best I can,
it's just...

30:39.019 --> 30:39.963
You're so...

30:40.129 --> 30:41.089
So what?

30:41.255 --> 30:42.132
Wiggly.

30:44.611 --> 30:45.260
Duck!

30:48.272 --> 30:49.431
It's been fun.

31:03.027 --> 31:03.905
Lip gloss?

31:06.796 --> 31:08.074
I noticed you're with Jake.

31:08.639 --> 31:09.892
We're just friends.

31:10.017 --> 31:12.329
I don't care.
We're not together anymore.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.129
You look really pretty.

31:21.295 --> 31:22.296
Thanks.

31:23.137 --> 31:24.132
So do you.

31:28.718 --> 31:30.233
What was that?

31:30.761 --> 31:32.277
You look really pretty.

31:32.402 --> 31:35.810
Help me in, so I can slap you.

31:38.903 --> 31:41.608
You're a bitch,
and it's your fault Jake dumped me.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.943
Break in yourself.

31:56.977 --> 31:58.447
<i>I was living in the moment</i>

31:58.572 --> 32:01.461
<i>and I didn't know
if it was by chance or by choice,</i>

32:01.586 --> 32:02.888
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

32:03.013 --> 32:05.213
<i>It was time for me to bust a move.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:23.233
- I'm busy.
- Listen to me please.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.652
If you give me one more chance
I'll sweep you off your feet.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.780
On the dancefloor,
and finally be your guy.

32:28.946 --> 32:29.990
It's you.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.534
It's you.
It's always been you.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.952
I was just too blind to see it.

32:38.073 --> 32:39.382
Where did Tamara go?

32:43.070 --> 32:44.880
Ricky is the missed connection.

32:45.046 --> 32:48.008
- He's a what?
- It's a long story.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.235
Look, I only have 60 bucks.

32:50.360 --> 32:54.020
But I can promise you that helping me get in
is like the gift that'll we'll keep on giving.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.430
Like your acne.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.219
Lighten up, it was a joke.
I can double your money on monday.

33:04.861 --> 33:06.180
You're having a good time?

33:07.776 --> 33:09.946
- You?
- I always have a good time with you.

33:10.112 --> 33:12.245
<i>It was exactly what I was thinking.</i>

33:12.370 --> 33:14.159
<i>Everything with Jake was easy.</i>

33:14.325 --> 33:16.225
Everything with you is easy.

33:17.156 --> 33:19.497
Do you think things happen to us
by chance or by choice?

33:20.105 --> 33:21.458
- In what way?
- Fate.

33:22.129 --> 33:23.418
Do you believe in fate?

33:24.082 --> 33:24.961
I don't know.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.504
But...

33:26.670 --> 33:29.752
considering you're here
with me right now

33:31.457 --> 33:33.511
means the universe
is working in my favour.

33:34.396 --> 33:37.082
<i>Maybe the universe
was working in my favour, too.</i>

33:51.923 --> 33:54.124
<i>Everything was as it was meant to be.</i>

33:54.714 --> 33:57.661
<i>Because finally the other guy
I had been pining over</i>

33:57.827 --> 33:59.164
<i>was all but a distant...</i>

34:00.844 --> 34:01.980
<i>40 feet away.</i>

34:17.596 --> 34:19.431
I'm really stoked you made it.

34:19.598 --> 34:22.601
- Who did you come with?
- Nobody. There was a girl...

34:23.726 --> 34:24.938
but I messed it up.

34:25.971 --> 34:28.190
- What happened?
- You don't wanna know.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.614
I do.

34:32.069 --> 34:33.571
I was going to take this girl,

34:34.929 --> 34:35.949
this great girl

34:36.114 --> 34:38.451
and things got complicated,
and I was trying

34:38.761 --> 34:40.786
not to hurt someone else
but I ended up hurting her.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.331
I didn't think she was gonna come
so I went to her house.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.043
- You went to her house?
- Her dad said she was here.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.172
Well, where is she?

34:51.860 --> 34:53.382
- She's with another guy.
- Dude.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.719
That sucks.
You should steal her away.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.514
I think it's too late.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.434
What do you think, is it too late?

35:03.292 --> 35:04.542
<i>I was confused.</i>

35:04.965 --> 35:06.730
<i>I didn't know
if I should listen to my head</i>

35:07.928 --> 35:09.065
<i>or my heart.</i>

35:12.318 --> 35:13.862
<i>So I went with my hand.</i>

35:16.367 --> 35:17.490
I'm so sorry.

35:18.374 --> 35:20.724
I think you're right.
It's too late.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.498
Okay.
Check one, two.

35:27.787 --> 35:30.003
Time to announce this year's

35:30.169 --> 35:31.669
winter formal court.

35:34.055 --> 35:36.926
Let's get down to some business
on some...

35:38.177 --> 35:39.053
Dick.

35:40.112 --> 35:41.848
Dick Walters, take over.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.555
Put the cookie down, Ms Saxton.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.272
You are to leave immediately.

35:50.603 --> 35:51.483
Or what?

35:51.649 --> 35:53.610
Or I'll have you expelled.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.236
Really?
For what?

35:55.402 --> 35:57.989
You know what.
Stealing Jenna's file.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.075
The file isn't missing anymore,
is it?

36:00.241 --> 36:03.912
And I bet my Mercedes
that you've never reported it stolen.

36:04.841 --> 36:06.122
- I did not.
- Well then.

36:06.288 --> 36:08.586
I guess it's just your word against mine.

36:18.902 --> 36:20.602
Val, what are you doing?

36:22.234 --> 36:23.973
Mr Mischra, she just accosted me,

36:24.580 --> 36:26.434
and you witnessed it.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.136
I didn't witness anything.

36:30.133 --> 36:33.441
I will have you both fired.

36:33.607 --> 36:34.442
Go for it.

36:35.442 --> 36:39.322
I bet my Camry that your word
against ours won't get you very far.

36:42.057 --> 36:43.785
You've just been sucker-punched.

36:45.215 --> 36:46.729
This is actually mine.

36:50.085 --> 36:53.294
Now, for Sophomore Winter Court,

36:53.912 --> 36:55.004
envelopes, please.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.172
Got them, right here.
Knew that.

36:58.297 --> 36:59.384
Sophomore Princess

37:00.507 --> 37:01.552
is...

37:03.465 --> 37:04.681
Clark Stevenson.

37:11.989 --> 37:13.867
You're welcome, go girl.

37:14.956 --> 37:17.518
And Sophomore Prince

37:17.643 --> 37:18.730
is...

37:20.636 --> 37:22.157
Matty McKibben.

37:35.599 --> 37:37.699
<i>One door to my heart had closed.</i>

37:39.883 --> 37:41.903
<i>Which meant a new one could open.</i>

37:44.601 --> 37:47.434
I just wanna say,
I share this with you...

37:47.857 --> 37:49.284
Jenna Hamilton!

37:59.660 --> 38:01.487
Oh, come on, one more!

38:03.707 --> 38:05.950
- What?
- You really like to dance.

38:09.536 --> 38:12.248
We're gonna head up Josh's after party.
Guys wanna come?

38:12.414 --> 38:14.918
- Harrisson's parents have a waterbed.
- Ricky!

38:18.271 --> 38:19.672
It's up to you.

38:20.701 --> 38:22.008
I think we're gonna pass.

38:28.108 --> 38:29.352
Let's get our stuff.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.692
There's something stuck to your back.

38:40.478 --> 38:43.029
- Like dirty code?
- Like what?

38:43.195 --> 38:45.467
- Like...
- Like there's a note

38:45.592 --> 38:46.908
stuck to your back.

38:48.529 --> 38:51.287
My parents are over at my neighbor's,
which means

38:51.453 --> 38:54.191
they're getting hammered
and they're not coming home anytime soon.

38:56.665 --> 38:58.336
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes.

39:00.607 --> 39:03.257
- Actually, is it OK if you don't come in?
- Sure.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.386
It's not that I don't want you to,
I do.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.973
- But I want to take things slowly.
- There's no rush.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.061
I'm not going anywhere.

39:16.371 --> 39:17.188
What is it?

39:17.760 --> 39:21.122
Tonight's the first night
anyone's ever held my hand in public.

39:22.213 --> 39:23.569
Besides my parents.

39:24.464 --> 39:26.408
- Does that freak you out?
- No.

39:28.972 --> 39:31.109
It just makes me realize
what I've been missing.

39:42.027 --> 39:44.760
Look what you've done.
I've completely blanked on the alarm code.

39:44.885 --> 39:47.728
- Now I have to call my parents.
- Do you want me to stay?

39:50.944 --> 39:52.990
Don't be freaked out
if I call you when I get home.

39:53.115 --> 39:54.059
I won't.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.422
I'll only be freaked out
if you don't.

40:05.404 --> 40:08.730
Hey it's me, I'm home.
I can't remember the alarm code.

40:08.855 --> 40:12.363
Wait, the code's in the junk-drawer.
Never mind.

40:23.086 --> 40:24.781
<i>Someone once said that it is choice,</i>

40:24.906 --> 40:27.527
<i>not chance,
that determines our destiny.</i>

40:28.442 --> 40:30.171
<i>But it was hard for me to process</i>

40:30.296 --> 40:32.805
<i>who would ever choose
to find what I found.</i>

40:35.742 --> 40:37.143
<i>It was chance.</i>

40:40.072 --> 40:41.073
Mum?

40:42.305 --> 40:48.217
