00:01.209 --> 00:04.312
Pick up!
Tables 12, 4, 11.

00:04.314 --> 00:05.313
Got it.

00:05.315 --> 00:07.548
Hey,
when you get a second,

00:07.550 --> 00:10.217
stop looking at my boobs.

00:13.689 --> 00:15.339
Excuse me.

00:15.341 --> 00:16.390
Waitress?

00:16.392 --> 00:18.609
Dude?

00:20.879 --> 00:22.229
Hi, what can I get ya?

00:22.231 --> 00:24.365
We need some...

00:24.367 --> 00:25.399
Is that annoying?

00:27.003 --> 00:28.085
Is that
obnoxious and rude?

00:29.789 --> 00:31.789
Would you find it distracting
if someone did that to you

00:31.791 --> 00:32.906
while you were working?

00:32.908 --> 00:35.593
Oh, you don't have a job.
Sorry.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.511
Damn, dude,
she burned you.

00:37.513 --> 00:38.546
Oh.

00:38.548 --> 00:41.799
No, hipster.

00:41.801 --> 00:44.385
Do not think we're on the same
team. We have nothing in common.

00:44.387 --> 00:46.420
I wear knit hats
when it's cold out.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.023
You wear knit hats
'cause of coldplay.

00:50.692 --> 00:52.393
You have tattoos
to piss off your dad.

00:52.395 --> 00:55.095
My dad doesn't know
he's my dad.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.930
You think...

00:56.932 --> 00:58.532
This is the sound
that gets you service.

00:58.534 --> 01:00.234
I think...

01:00.236 --> 01:03.437
This is the sound
that dries up my vagina.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.741
The other waitress
disappeared, the Russian one.

01:06.743 --> 01:08.325
We need horseradish.

01:08.327 --> 01:09.443
Please.

01:09.445 --> 01:12.546
That, ladies,
is how you treat a waitress.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.637
Paulina!

01:22.007 --> 01:23.591
Oh, so... so good, oh...

01:23.593 --> 01:26.794
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
you were on break.

01:27.763 --> 01:28.979
I just need
some horseradish.

01:28.981 --> 01:31.482
- Here.
- Oh, cool.

01:35.504 --> 01:37.605
Excuse me,
where's my waitress?

01:39.025 --> 01:41.475
She's coming.

01:56.591 --> 01:59.010
Earl.

01:59.012 --> 01:59.961
Earl!

01:59.963 --> 02:02.880
I made your favorite,
red velvet.

02:02.882 --> 02:06.951
My little cupcake
brought me a cupcake.

02:06.953 --> 02:08.134
Let me pay you for that.

02:08.137 --> 02:09.637
Oh, no, no.
It's on the house.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.138
It's your birthday.

02:11.140 --> 02:12.306
How old are you gonna be?

02:12.308 --> 02:13.757
75.

02:13.759 --> 02:17.594
Oh, Earl, if you were just
three years younger.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.430
Max, Max, big news.

02:19.432 --> 02:22.116
The new boss fired
that Russian waitress, Paulina.

02:22.118 --> 02:26.654
Turns out Chesty Kournikova
was Vladimir puttin' it out.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.295
Hello today.
I have paycheck for you.

02:34.297 --> 02:37.614
I need to talk to you.
You fired Paulina, Han?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.333
I am no longer Han Lee.

02:39.335 --> 02:40.418
I have new American name

02:40.420 --> 02:41.836
to go with
changing neighborhood.

02:41.838 --> 02:43.421
<I>To go with
the changing neighborhood.</I>

02:43.423 --> 02:45.723
You need to remember this
for your immigration exam.

02:45.725 --> 02:49.477
<I>Correct. To go with
the changing neighborhood.</I>

02:51.848 --> 02:56.534
Bryce?
Your name is Bryce Lee?

02:59.237 --> 03:01.305
Wait, wait,
um, um, um...

03:01.307 --> 03:04.025
Don't hire a new waitress,
okay?

03:04.027 --> 03:05.309
I've been doing
all the work anyway,

03:05.311 --> 03:06.827
and I really could use
the extra money.

03:06.829 --> 03:08.029
You need help.

03:08.031 --> 03:11.165
- No, I don't.
- Everyone need help sometimes.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.451
I don't. I've been waiting
my whole life, okay?

03:13.453 --> 03:16.087
I've waited on tables,
I've waited in bars,

03:16.089 --> 03:18.472
I've waited on
home pregnancy tests.

03:18.474 --> 03:20.491
I already hire new waitress.

03:20.493 --> 03:23.260
She work in all top restaurants
in Manhattan.

03:23.262 --> 03:26.097
I gave her
Paulina's uniform.

03:27.382 --> 03:29.133
- Hi.

03:29.135 --> 03:31.802
Mr. Lee,
not to complain,

03:31.804 --> 03:35.272
but I think someone
wore this uniform before me,

03:35.274 --> 03:37.958
like right before me.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.693
Is it possible
that I could get another one?

03:39.695 --> 03:43.531
Maybe one that's
a little less moist.

03:43.533 --> 03:46.951
Also this mustard color doesn't
really go with my skin tone,

03:46.953 --> 03:49.954
neither do
the mustard stains...

03:49.956 --> 03:52.406
And these
various other stains,

03:52.408 --> 03:54.909
and smells.
I hope that's clam chowder.

03:54.911 --> 03:57.161
So...

03:57.163 --> 03:58.862
I think it'd be better
for everyone,

03:58.864 --> 04:01.198
including
my immune system,

04:01.200 --> 04:03.534
if I just keep on wearing
what I'm wearing,

04:03.536 --> 04:06.370
and not the apron,
'cause this is Chanel.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.556
So thank you,

04:08.558 --> 04:11.308
and let's waitress.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.398
- Whatever that is,

04:17.399 --> 04:19.065
it does not belong
in this diner.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.152
It belongs
in a show on Bravo.

04:22.604 --> 04:25.722
But she blonde,
hair so shiny,

04:25.724 --> 04:27.358
good for business.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.059
Where do you even
find these people?

04:29.061 --> 04:32.363
The Russian hooker, the one
before that was a meth addict.

04:32.365 --> 04:34.165
You train her,
I am boss.

04:34.167 --> 04:37.368
- <I>Da</I> boss.
- Oh.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.703
Fine, but make her
wear the uniform.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.506
Are you sure we can't get
the meth addict back?

04:42.508 --> 04:45.742
She was really good
at cleaning.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.295
But her teeth
fall out.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.718
You are really judgmental,
you know that?

04:56.938 --> 04:59.807
I'm only gonna say this once,
so pay attention.

04:59.809 --> 05:02.243
I'm Caroline, by the way.
And you're Max?

05:02.245 --> 05:06.614
Don't get attached.

05:06.616 --> 05:09.066
This is the Williamsburg diner,
owned by Han Lee,

05:09.068 --> 05:10.734
who just changed his name
to Bryce Lee,

05:10.736 --> 05:14.822
because I guess he wants people
to take him even less seriously.

05:14.824 --> 05:16.657
Eight months ago he bought it
from the Russian mob.

05:16.659 --> 05:19.493
Clientele used to be
all eastern bloc criminals

05:19.495 --> 05:22.296
and crack whores, but then
he took it over and ruined it.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.635
Hey, sexy woman.

05:27.637 --> 05:29.637
You look so pretty today.

05:29.639 --> 05:34.291
You look so beautiful, I forgot
how bad your personality is.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.595
Thanks, Oleg.

05:37.597 --> 05:40.347
Hey, Barbie.

05:44.419 --> 05:47.188
He will hit on you
aggressively and relentlessly.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.656
He doesn't realize
he looks like that,

05:48.658 --> 05:52.142
and I don't have the heart
to tell him.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.494
Could we have some menus?

05:53.496 --> 05:54.745
Oh, sure.

05:54.747 --> 05:56.997
Don't smile.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.782
'Cause it raises the bar,
and then I have to smile,

05:58.784 --> 05:59.917
and I can't be doing that.

05:59.919 --> 06:03.820
It's exhausting
and I have a bad back.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.457
That's Earl,
we're in love.

06:06.459 --> 06:07.708
Do not talk to him,

06:07.710 --> 06:10.127
unless you want to feel whiter
than you already are.

06:10.129 --> 06:12.630
Oh, and that stain?

06:12.632 --> 06:15.666
Not clam chowder.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.018
Go marry the ketchups.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.689
Marry the ketchups.
I'm on it.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:34.002 --> 06:37.871
Okay.
Now divorce the ketchups.

06:41.326 --> 06:43.160
Stop.
Just stop.

06:43.162 --> 06:45.045
There's no such thing
as divorcing the ketchups.

06:45.047 --> 06:46.830
You've never waitressed
a day in your life.

06:46.832 --> 06:47.864
Yes, I have.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.083
You expect me
to believe you

06:49.085 --> 06:52.035
after watching that whole
Temple Grandin routine?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.454
- I'm telling Lee.
- Okay, okay,

06:53.456 --> 06:55.339
I may have enhanced
my resume.

06:55.341 --> 06:59.176
Enhanced?
What, are we in Paris?

06:59.178 --> 07:01.478
Please,
I really need this job, okay?

07:01.480 --> 07:02.930
We lost all of our money.

07:02.932 --> 07:05.482
My trust fund was taken
for legal fees.

07:05.484 --> 07:07.017
My dad is in jail.

07:07.019 --> 07:09.553
What? What are you,
Martin Channing's daughter?

07:10.739 --> 07:14.224
Where's the paper?

07:14.226 --> 07:16.410
Martin Channing?

07:16.412 --> 07:18.779
The guy who ripped off
the entire city is your father.

07:18.781 --> 07:22.533
He told us we were
having a good year.

07:22.535 --> 07:24.385
You're
Caroline Channing.

07:24.387 --> 07:26.203
You're like
a billionaire.

07:26.205 --> 07:28.672
Was.
Was a billionaire.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.924
They froze all our assets,
everything's gone.

07:30.926 --> 07:32.743
I only have
what I could grab,

07:32.745 --> 07:35.179
and I grabbed
all the wrong things.

07:35.181 --> 07:37.931
- So do you know the president?
- I've met him.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.266
- He's hot.
- He's the president.

07:39.268 --> 07:40.884
- Have you been to Switzerland?
- Yes.

07:40.886 --> 07:42.269
- Do you have a horse?
- Yes.

07:42.271 --> 07:46.557
- Do you know Paris Hilton?
- No, she's a hundred.

07:46.559 --> 07:48.759
Excuse me, uh,
two hot chocolate, please.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.027
- Comin' up.
- It...

07:50.029 --> 07:51.729
let me do that, please.

07:51.731 --> 07:53.063
I'm a really
fast learner.

07:53.065 --> 07:54.365
I went to
Wharton business school.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.817
I got 2,300 on my SAT's

07:56.819 --> 07:59.436
Can you make a hot chocolate,
or not?

08:04.159 --> 08:05.709
Nailed it.

08:10.548 --> 08:13.717
We split the tips.
Give me yours.

08:17.889 --> 08:20.674
You did better
than I thought you would.

08:20.676 --> 08:22.459
Listen, tonight
I thought of a way

08:22.461 --> 08:23.644
we could make
some extra money.

08:23.646 --> 08:25.179
They've totally
underestimated

08:25.181 --> 08:27.014
the price point
on those red velvet cupcakes.

08:27.016 --> 08:29.566
In Manhattan the asking price
is at least seven,

08:29.568 --> 08:34.071
so we could sell them for seven,
and then pocket the difference.

08:34.073 --> 08:36.490
Nothing about that
sounds wrong to you?

08:36.491 --> 08:38.826
It's not our fault that
the idiot who makes the cupcakes

08:38.828 --> 08:40.811
doesn't know their worth.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.881
I'm the idiot
who makes the cupcakes.

08:44.949 --> 08:47.034
New information.

08:47.036 --> 08:48.252
That's stupid.

08:48.254 --> 08:50.754
No one would pay $7
for one of my cupcakes.

08:50.756 --> 08:53.757
Really?
'Cause...

08:57.045 --> 09:00.514
Well, at least we know
you're not adopted.

09:03.218 --> 09:05.636
So how'd you even
end up in Brooklyn?

09:05.638 --> 09:07.771
Oh,
I went on monster.com.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.056
Typed in
"place where nobody

09:09.058 --> 09:11.508
from the Upper East Side
would ever go, ever,"

09:11.510 --> 09:14.528
and this diner came up.

09:14.530 --> 09:16.363
You can't wear
a fancy leather jacket

09:16.365 --> 09:17.531
outside in this neighborhood.

09:17.533 --> 09:18.682
You have to turn it
inside out.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.284
Oh.

09:20.286 --> 09:22.953
Fur. Cool.
Turn it back.

09:24.907 --> 09:26.990
So where do you live?

09:26.992 --> 09:30.077
Our townhouse was taken
and bolted up by the bank, so...

09:30.079 --> 09:32.362
Is this where I'm supposed to
feel sorry for you?

09:32.364 --> 09:34.965
I mean,
I don't want you to,

09:34.967 --> 09:39.202
but just so you know,
a well-adjusted person would.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.705
I'm dead inside.

09:41.707 --> 09:45.092
You make that
pretty obvious.

09:45.094 --> 09:48.044
Anyway, I'm just gonna stay
in the city with a friend.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.397
I live a couple of blocks
that way.

09:50.399 --> 09:55.018
I'd walk you to the subway,
it's just that I don't want to.

09:55.020 --> 09:58.372
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:08.284 --> 10:11.251
♪ ♪

10:11.253 --> 10:13.620
Why is the music so loud?

10:13.622 --> 10:15.289
Whoa!

10:15.291 --> 10:16.457
It's 3:00
in the morning.

10:16.459 --> 10:17.791
I'm sorry.

10:19.961 --> 10:22.846
It's cool.
So what are you doin'?

10:22.848 --> 10:25.248
The band's practicing.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.934
But you're not
playing any instruments.

10:26.936 --> 10:28.469
Yeah,
that's how we practice.

10:28.471 --> 10:30.220
We, like,
listen to other good music

10:30.222 --> 10:32.890
and play it in our head.

10:32.892 --> 10:35.559
It's like <I>The Secret.</I>

10:35.561 --> 10:38.395
Well, I have a secret
for you guys.

10:38.397 --> 10:40.447
- Get out!
- Whoa!

10:41.816 --> 10:43.734
- Uh, you guys better go.
- We should go.

10:43.736 --> 10:46.203
Sorry, guys, I still
have to make the cupcakes.

10:46.205 --> 10:49.556
Cupcakes? For why? You can
just buy 'em at the store.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.127
You can do that in
the morning, babe, come to bed.

10:54.129 --> 10:56.947
No, I can't. I have to
be in the city by 10:00.

10:59.217 --> 11:02.302
Fine.
You can have three minutes.

11:04.672 --> 11:08.258
Fine, you can have eight,
one for each ab.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.811
Boom!

11:12.764 --> 11:15.516
Stand clear
of the closing doors.

11:22.273 --> 11:25.275
Well, I can cross that
off my bucket list.

11:34.702 --> 11:35.752
Hey.

11:35.754 --> 11:36.820
I have a taser!

11:36.822 --> 11:39.840
Oh!

11:39.842 --> 11:42.876
Oh, my God.

11:46.468 --> 11:49.053
I am so sorry.

11:49.055 --> 11:52.073
I didn't think it would hurt
so much. It's pink.

11:52.075 --> 11:54.225
It didn't feel pink.

11:54.227 --> 11:57.778
I didn't know it was you.
I thought I was being raped.

11:57.780 --> 12:01.315
That's not
what rape feels like.

12:02.617 --> 12:04.402
Did you...

12:04.404 --> 12:06.537
did you
sleep on the subway?

12:06.539 --> 12:08.139
- I had nowhere else to go,

12:08.141 --> 12:10.458
and I'm too afraid
to sleep outside on the street.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.377
God, you're spoiled.

12:13.379 --> 12:16.497
Next stop, greenpoint.

12:16.499 --> 12:19.083
Ugh! Get your stuff. Come on,
I'll take you to my place,

12:19.085 --> 12:20.434
but hurry.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.953
'Cause I have to be
in the city in 30 minutes.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.591
Call me.

12:30.645 --> 12:33.848
Oh, my God,
you've been robbed!

12:36.101 --> 12:37.902
This is
how it always looks.

12:37.904 --> 12:40.971
Oh, my God,
totally cute!

12:40.973 --> 12:43.074
All right,
I'll be back at 4:00,

12:43.076 --> 12:45.159
and we can go to work together.
Bathroom, bedroom,

12:45.161 --> 12:47.111
boyfriend sleeps till 4:00,
yard.

12:47.113 --> 12:49.780
Oh, you have a yard.

12:49.782 --> 12:54.135
Looks like a really nice place
to relax and do crack.

12:56.088 --> 12:57.705
It is.

12:59.007 --> 13:01.158
I gotta go, I'm gonna be late
for my other job in the city.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.593
You have two jobs?

13:02.595 --> 13:05.162
Yes, I babysit
for a Manhattan socialite diva.

13:05.164 --> 13:06.830
Now I have a set.

13:10.668 --> 13:12.169
Sorry I'm late.

13:12.171 --> 13:13.437
Oh, thank God
you're here,

13:13.439 --> 13:14.688
there is
a bridge and tunnel smell

13:14.690 --> 13:18.642
over by the babies
that's stressing me out.

13:18.644 --> 13:20.444
Their diapers
probably need to be changed.

13:20.446 --> 13:23.781
Again? I swear,
the morning nanny just did that.

13:23.783 --> 13:26.033
Motherhood is for reals.

13:27.986 --> 13:30.538
Max, remind me,
what's my Twitter password?

13:30.540 --> 13:32.189
Twitter password.

13:32.191 --> 13:33.908
Yes!

13:34.692 --> 13:38.862
Hi, Brad.
Hi, Angelina.

13:38.864 --> 13:41.715
Max, I need to tell you
something because we're family.

13:41.717 --> 13:45.219
Now get me room temperature
water and come over here.

13:48.873 --> 13:52.176
We are victims
of the Channing Ponzi scheme.

13:52.178 --> 13:56.263
Me, David,
and Brangelina.

13:56.265 --> 13:58.849
How much money
did you lose?

13:58.851 --> 14:02.436
Hold my hands.

14:02.438 --> 14:05.689
Nothing.

14:05.691 --> 14:07.708
But it really scared me.

14:09.528 --> 14:12.663
Open that?

14:12.665 --> 14:14.832
So do you know
Caroline Channing?

14:14.834 --> 14:17.401
No,
but she lost everything.

14:17.403 --> 14:19.570
She has no money.

14:19.572 --> 14:21.005
Can you imagine
having no money?

14:21.007 --> 14:25.876
I mean, you wouldn't even
have any money.

14:25.878 --> 14:28.712
You should twit that.

14:28.714 --> 14:31.465
And no one
will even talk to her.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.517
I heard she went
to six different friends' houses

14:33.519 --> 14:34.852
for a place to stay,

14:34.854 --> 14:37.771
and they all had to pretend
they weren't home.

14:37.773 --> 14:39.590
- That's not cool.
- Yeah.

14:39.592 --> 14:41.758
- That's really sad.
- So sad.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.611
Breaks my heart.

14:43.613 --> 14:46.163
I guess motherhood has really
opened me up emotionally.

14:46.165 --> 14:48.482
Max, I need to hold
one of the babies,

14:48.484 --> 14:51.902
bring me one.

14:54.273 --> 14:57.324
No, the other one.
That's not the good one.

15:02.163 --> 15:03.447
Hello.

15:03.449 --> 15:07.218
Oh, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry
if I woke you up.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.504
Who are you?

15:10.506 --> 15:13.757
I'm Max's friend.
Uh, don't tell her I said that.

15:13.759 --> 15:15.259
I have a feeling if she heard me
call her my friend,

15:15.261 --> 15:17.561
she'd stab me.

15:17.563 --> 15:18.979
What are you doin'
over there?

15:18.981 --> 15:20.464
Just washing my uniform,

15:20.466 --> 15:21.899
trying to make it
a little more cute

15:21.901 --> 15:23.684
and a little less crusty.

15:23.686 --> 15:24.935
Oh, watch out!

15:24.937 --> 15:26.770
Oh!
Sorry, oh, my...

15:26.772 --> 15:30.641
- Do you have a towel or a rag?
- No, I... I got it.

15:30.643 --> 15:31.992
Oh, okay.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.867
I'm Robbie.

15:39.869 --> 15:42.253
I'm uncomfortable.

15:42.255 --> 15:43.337
You're getting me wet.

15:43.339 --> 15:45.873
That's the point.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.491
You're Max's boyfriend.

15:47.493 --> 15:48.525
It's cool.

15:48.527 --> 15:51.462
No, it's not.
Back up, Jersey shore.

15:54.549 --> 15:56.333
You're pathetic,

15:56.335 --> 15:58.385
and that's coming from someone
who's homeless

15:58.387 --> 16:01.355
and wearing white
after labor day.

16:08.196 --> 16:11.448
And I've seen better.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.918
No, you haven't.

16:19.791 --> 16:21.241
Hey.
Why didn't you wait for me?

16:21.243 --> 16:23.043
I thought we were
coming over together.

16:23.045 --> 16:27.381
Oh. Um, I wanted to get here
early to marry the ketchups.

16:28.466 --> 16:29.700
Listen,
I heard something

16:29.702 --> 16:31.302
really upsetting
about you today.

16:31.304 --> 16:33.387
What did he say,
that I came on to him?

16:34.205 --> 16:35.372
Him who?

16:35.374 --> 16:37.040
Nothing.

16:43.231 --> 16:44.765
Him, Robbie?

16:44.767 --> 16:46.817
It's none of my business,

16:46.819 --> 16:49.720
but you deserve better
than that guy.

16:49.722 --> 16:52.406
Yeah,
it is none of your business.

16:52.408 --> 16:55.025
Ooh, I was just starting
to feel sorry for you.

16:55.027 --> 16:58.579
I'm just saying,
you're worth more than that.

16:58.581 --> 17:00.664
What, I'm supposed to
believe you about this?

17:00.666 --> 17:02.700
The person who lied
on their resume,

17:02.702 --> 17:04.402
and lied about the cupcakes...
you're a liar.

17:05.404 --> 17:07.855
- I'm just trying to help.
- You know what?

17:07.857 --> 17:10.174
Since you seem to know
so much about everything,

17:10.175 --> 17:11.791
why don't you
take your Wharton degree,

17:11.794 --> 17:14.411
and your ridiculous coat, and
figure this all out yourself.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.546
Max.

17:15.548 --> 17:17.348
- Max, wait.
- Oh, look,

17:17.349 --> 17:19.599
the arcade fire concert
just let out across the street,

17:19.602 --> 17:21.435
good luck with that.

17:21.436 --> 17:23.354
She's coming back,
right?

17:23.356 --> 17:24.588
She's not gonna
leave me here alone

17:24.589 --> 17:26.557
with a restaurant
full of people?

17:26.559 --> 17:29.026
Let me put it to you
this way.

17:29.028 --> 17:30.110
You might as well be

17:30.112 --> 17:33.947
a night maid
at the Schwarzenegger house.

17:33.949 --> 17:36.933
You got screwed.

17:45.474 --> 17:47.024
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

17:47.026 --> 17:49.861
That feels so good.

17:49.863 --> 17:51.329
Now put your tambourine
around it.

17:54.634 --> 17:56.417
Hi, honey, I'm home.

17:58.888 --> 18:01.840
I want you gone
by the time I get back.

18:01.842 --> 18:04.208
Babe!
Babe, I can explain.

18:05.043 --> 18:08.530
You weren't
supposed to be home.

18:08.532 --> 18:09.848
People say
I deserve better than you.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.599
Who?

18:11.601 --> 18:14.185
That blonde girl? She doesn't
know what she's talkin' about.

18:14.187 --> 18:16.888
She went to Wharton

18:16.890 --> 18:18.389
and Switzerland.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.368
Yo, yo.
Look at that.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.120
That girl is
workin' harder

18:32.122 --> 18:36.508
than Stephen Hawking tryin'
to put in a pair of cufflinks.

18:38.928 --> 18:40.461
Here, let me help you
with that.

18:40.463 --> 18:41.629
I don't need any help.

18:41.631 --> 18:44.182
Everyone needs help
sometimes.

18:49.638 --> 18:53.308
This isn't
what I ordered.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.976
This is Caroline.

18:54.978 --> 18:56.227
She may have gotten
your order wrong,

18:56.229 --> 18:58.196
but she does
get some things right.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.436
Thank you.

19:05.438 --> 19:08.122
- No, thank you.

19:08.124 --> 19:10.375
What'd you see in that guy,
anyway?

19:10.377 --> 19:12.460
He had these
muscle thingies.

19:12.462 --> 19:15.413
- Oh, those things?
- Yeah.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.581
I don't know
what those are called,

19:16.583 --> 19:19.467
but they make smart girls
stupid.

19:19.469 --> 19:20.785
- Max!

19:20.787 --> 19:22.971
I thought your tight ass
wasn't coming in tonight,

19:22.973 --> 19:26.341
and my heart
broke in half.

19:26.343 --> 19:29.127
You know what, Oleg?

19:29.129 --> 19:30.962
I needed that.

19:36.735 --> 19:39.637
So, um...

19:39.639 --> 19:41.906
I need a roommate,
if you want to crash.

19:41.908 --> 19:43.241
Hmm.

19:43.243 --> 19:48.029
Not gonna lie, the subway's
cleaner than your couch.

19:48.031 --> 19:50.198
Wow.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.283
I just felt myself
starting to like you.

19:52.285 --> 19:54.002
Really? Because I really feel
like we could...

19:54.004 --> 19:56.955
I knew that wouldn't last.

19:56.957 --> 19:59.173
Come on.

19:59.175 --> 20:00.675
Tomorrow we can
go into the city

20:00.677 --> 20:02.260
and get
the rest of your stuff.

20:02.262 --> 20:04.512
Everything's locked up.

20:04.514 --> 20:07.715
What, you have nothing that
you care about that we can get?

20:07.717 --> 20:09.267
Well,
there is one thing.

20:11.553 --> 20:14.522
The weirdest thing
is that nobody stopped us.

20:16.191 --> 20:17.692
I'm gonna save
a fortune,

20:17.694 --> 20:20.111
keeping him here
instead of in the stables.

20:20.113 --> 20:24.565
When did you put this whole
horse-in-my-yard thing together?

20:24.567 --> 20:25.733
I can't help it.

20:25.735 --> 20:27.685
I see an opportunity,
and I make it happen,

20:27.687 --> 20:29.821
like with your cupcakes.

20:29.823 --> 20:31.906
Like what
with my cupcakes?

20:31.908 --> 20:34.375
Ready?
To open a bake shop,

20:34.377 --> 20:36.544
all we need is
250 grand start-up money,

20:36.546 --> 20:37.962
for the real estate,
and the basic equipment...

20:37.964 --> 20:40.214
Yeah. Oh.

20:40.216 --> 20:42.634
- 250 grand, that's all?
- Yeah.

20:42.636 --> 20:44.419
Did freakin' Chestnut here
kick you in the head

20:44.421 --> 20:46.054
while I was in Starbucks?

20:46.056 --> 20:47.305
- Hear me out.

20:47.307 --> 20:50.008
If we both worked two jobs
and made $2,000 a week,

20:50.010 --> 20:52.477
we could open a cupcake business
in a little over a year.

20:52.479 --> 20:55.463
In the past two days,
we've made $387,

20:55.465 --> 20:56.714
and that's a good start.

20:56.716 --> 20:57.932
We can make extra money
at other jobs,

20:57.934 --> 21:00.435
like publicists,
advertising executives...

21:00.437 --> 21:03.888
Janitors, drug mules.

21:05.024 --> 21:07.742
We really need to
work on your self-esteem.

21:07.744 --> 21:08.826
So...

21:08.828 --> 21:11.395
You, cupcakes,
me, business background,

21:11.397 --> 21:15.216
us, success.
What do you think?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.252
I think
you have a horse.

21:18.254 --> 21:21.255
I think we have a horse.

21:24.177 --> 21:26.961
Don't get attached.
