<i><font color=#ca> ~ Fora Temer ~ </font></i>

00:05.498 --> 00:09.368
Mmm.
You're roasting good!

00:09.436 --> 00:10.937
And...

00:12.505 --> 00:14.640
Good job not setting that one on fire.

00:14.708 --> 00:17.242
Mm-hmm.
What is it about marshmallows

00:17.344 --> 00:19.545
that make them so... good?

00:19.612 --> 00:21.780
It's probably the animal
by-product.

00:21.848 --> 00:24.483
You mean like... poop?

00:24.551 --> 00:28.320
No.
Stuff like hooves, bone marrow,

00:28.388 --> 00:32.701
collagen... and lots
of sugar and corn syrup.

00:32.735 --> 00:34.193
Corn sugar!

00:34.294 --> 00:37.340
Sugar syrup!
Mmm!

00:37.375 --> 00:40.466
Bone marrow!

00:40.533 --> 00:44.141
Hello?

00:44.176 --> 00:46.238
<i>Have you been watching
world weather news?</i>

00:46.339 --> 00:50.576
Um... no.
Steven's still grounded

00:50.643 --> 00:52.752
- from watching TV.
- I see.

00:52.937 --> 00:54.463
<i>Well, there's a snowstorm on
its way to Beach City,</i>

00:54.531 --> 00:55.864
<i>and I don't want
you getting snowed in.</i>

00:55.965 --> 00:58.000
<i>You need to get a
ride home this instant.</i>

00:58.067 --> 01:00.702
<i>Otherwise, your father is
gonna try to pick you up.</i>

01:00.770 --> 01:03.805
Oh, no. Don't send dad.
I'll be home soon.

01:03.873 --> 01:06.975
- Looks like I got to get going.
- Oh, no!

01:07.076 --> 01:09.511
There's a snowstorm coming
through, and my parents don't

01:09.612 --> 01:13.615
- want me getting stuck here.
- Man! That stinks!

01:13.683 --> 01:17.553
Wouldn't it be fun if we got
snowed in together?

01:17.654 --> 01:20.722
We could stay up all night
and watch the snow fall!

01:22.926 --> 01:25.327
- Hello, you two.
- Hi, Garnet.

01:25.395 --> 01:28.453
- Hi, Garnet.
- You all having a nice time?

01:28.488 --> 01:30.644
Yeah, but Connie has to go soon.

01:30.645 --> 01:32.801
There's a snowstorm a-comin'.

01:32.869 --> 01:35.904
Maybe the storm will miss us.
Sometimes the forecast

01:35.972 --> 01:37.906
- is completely wrong.
- Nope.

01:37.974 --> 01:41.510
- It's definitely going to snow.
- That's the 411, yo.

01:41.578 --> 01:43.545
Trust.

01:43.613 --> 01:46.281
- Garnet has future vision.
- You kids better get

01:46.349 --> 01:49.619
- yourselves to Greg's.
- Wait ... We can't go yet.

01:49.654 --> 01:49.818
I've got to show you this

01:49.919 --> 01:52.287
- tube-tube video really quick.
- Steven.

01:52.355 --> 01:54.523
It's only,
like, one minute long.

01:54.591 --> 01:58.694
I know you don't want to go, but
you have to make the right choice.

02:02.532 --> 02:04.299
That tickles!

02:06.603 --> 02:08.502
Wow!

02:08.571 --> 02:11.273
Gotcha, Steven!

02:12.042 --> 02:13.442
Come on, kids.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.644
We got to get going if we're
gonna beat the storm.

02:15.712 --> 02:18.847
I'll start the van.
# Carabiner #

02:18.915 --> 02:23.485
- # Carabiner! #
- Aw! Do we got to go?

02:23.553 --> 02:25.654
Yes.
The Maheswarans think I'm

02:25.722 --> 02:28.924
a responsible parent, and I've
got to maintain that image.

02:29.837 --> 02:31.526
Guess this is it.

02:31.628 --> 02:34.763
Well, Dad, if you
want to look responsible, you

02:34.831 --> 02:37.466
should probably change
out of that sweatsuit.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.636
But it's cherries.
Everybody likes cherries.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.138
I'm a cherry man!

02:43.139 --> 02:45.574
Okay, I see your point.

02:45.675 --> 02:49.087
Just give me a second to change.

02:49.136 --> 02:55.172
- Steven, are you procrastinating?
- Nah. I'm just killing time.

02:55.173 --> 02:59.843
Aha! You can practically
smell the responsibility.

02:59.878 --> 03:02.218
Isn't that the
turtleneck you wore the first

03:02.253 --> 03:03.565
time you met them?
They're gonna think you only

03:03.666 --> 03:07.402
- have one fancy shirt.
- I do only have one fancy shirt.

03:07.623 --> 03:11.756
Don't worry, Dad.
We'll help you find the perfect,

03:11.774 --> 03:13.528
- most responsible outfit.
- I don't know.

03:13.629 --> 03:16.231
I haven't worn any of
this stuff in years.

03:20.836 --> 03:22.604
Ohh!

03:32.848 --> 03:37.218
- Okay, how about this one?
- I can't lie.

03:37.286 --> 03:39.854
That is the best
outfit I have ever seen.

03:39.922 --> 03:41.690
Okay, great! Let's go!

03:43.993 --> 03:45.560
Holy moly!

03:47.730 --> 03:50.015
That snow is really coming down.

04:05.681 --> 04:08.583
- W-What are we gonna do?
- Uhh...

04:08.684 --> 04:11.119
- I guess we'll have to walk.
- What?!

04:11.187 --> 04:13.589
A responsible parent
doesn't let two kids strand

04:13.590 --> 04:15.991
themselves in a van in
the middle of nowhere.

04:16.058 --> 04:18.593
<i>A responsible parent escorts</i>

04:18.661 --> 04:21.146
<i>those kids through wind, sleet, and snow</i>

04:21.147 --> 04:23.632
<i>to avoid making the other parents angry!</i>

04:29.984 --> 04:32.273
H-Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.677
H-Hello,
Dr. and Mr. Maheswaran.

04:35.745 --> 04:37.512
Sorry we're late.

04:38.848 --> 04:41.290
Mom, Dad...
you remember

04:41.291 --> 04:44.974
- Mr. Universe and Ste...
- Do you have any idea what time it is?!

04:45.009 --> 04:46.621
- Why are the children blue?!
- What are you do...

04:46.689 --> 04:49.357
Ah... ah... choo!

04:50.259 --> 04:53.128
She's sick!
You're going straight to bed,

04:53.195 --> 04:55.730
young lady!
That's the last time I let you

04:55.798 --> 04:59.634
- out during flu season.
- I think you know

04:59.735 --> 05:03.204
where the door is.
Since you're... standing in it.

05:03.272 --> 05:06.141
Uhh, I kind of crashed my ride.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.711
- Are you serious?!
- Yes.

05:09.779 --> 05:12.514
I'll go set up the pull-out couch.

05:12.581 --> 05:17.485
Uhh... okay.
So much for being responsible.

05:19.288 --> 05:22.157
Maybe I should
have worn the floral print.

05:37.173 --> 05:40.709
<i>Is everyone okay?</i>

05:40.776 --> 05:43.278
- Yeah.
- W-Wait.

05:43.345 --> 05:47.549
- What ... W-What happened?
- We wiped out.

05:47.650 --> 05:50.852
No, I mean,
why are we in the van?

05:50.953 --> 05:52.987
You're right.
We got to get out there and

05:53.055 --> 05:55.090
start walking if we
want to get Connie home.

05:55.157 --> 05:57.559
Dad! No!
We should stay put.

05:57.626 --> 06:02.014
- It'll be way safer this way.
- My parents are all about safety.

06:02.015 --> 06:06.664
- Heh. You can't argue with safety.
- It'll be like camping.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.870
But in cozy bucket seats.

06:16.011 --> 06:19.781
Thanks for dinner, Mr. Universe.

06:19.849 --> 06:21.783
<i>Itadakimasu.</i>

06:24.999 --> 06:27.756
Any requests?

06:27.823 --> 06:31.593
Hmm.
Let's hear a song about...

06:31.660 --> 06:35.296
a snack monster that loves...
animal by-products!

06:35.364 --> 06:37.632
Om-nom-nom!

06:37.700 --> 06:40.034
Hello?

06:40.102 --> 06:42.771
<i>Connie, are you still at
Steven Universe's house?</i>

06:42.838 --> 06:44.706
- I'm on my way.
- Dad, no!

06:44.774 --> 06:46.808
You know how bad you are
at driving in the snow!

06:46.909 --> 06:50.211
<i>- It's way too rough out here!
- I'm almost at Beach City,</i>

06:50.279 --> 06:52.525
<i>so start putting on your shoes.</i>

06:52.560 --> 06:54.949
I see some headlights.
Is that him?

06:55.017 --> 06:56.818
<i>Don't worry.</i>

06:56.919 --> 06:59.721
<i>I got it this time.
Oh, wait.</i>

06:59.789 --> 07:01.289
<i>Ohh!</i>

07:01.357 --> 07:04.225
Dad, stop the car!
You're right in front of us!

07:04.293 --> 07:07.195
<i>I-I got it. I got it! I ...</i>

07:07.263 --> 07:09.297
<i>Ohh!
I-I don't got it!</i>

07:09.365 --> 07:12.834
<i>I don't have anything!</i>

07:15.971 --> 07:20.608
- Whoa. Sorry, Steven. Are you okay?
- Connie, what's going on?!

07:20.676 --> 07:23.178
- Everything keeps repeating!
- Hey, come on, kids.

07:23.245 --> 07:25.580
We got to get going if we're
gonna beat the storm.

07:25.648 --> 07:28.817
I'll start the van.
# Carabiner #

07:28.884 --> 07:31.653
â™ª Carabiner! â™ª
Hey! What the ...

07:31.754 --> 07:34.722
My keys!

07:34.824 --> 07:37.659
I'm not gonna find those till Spring!

07:37.760 --> 07:39.594
- Come on, Connie!
- What?

07:39.662 --> 07:40.306
Hey!

07:40.307 --> 07:43.064
- Let's go back to my place.
- But my parents ...

07:43.132 --> 07:45.233
No, Connie!
You have to listen to me!

07:45.301 --> 07:48.102
If we leave Beach City, bad
things are gonna happen!

07:48.170 --> 07:50.751
I've seen it! Bad things!

07:50.752 --> 07:52.473
Several bad things!

07:55.978 --> 07:58.880
Um... okay.
Let me just call my mom

07:58.948 --> 08:02.784
and tell her.
Mom, this is Connie.

08:02.852 --> 08:04.619
I'm staying at Steven's overnight.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.911
<i>- Oh, no, you're not, young lady!
- But Mom!</i>

08:07.946 --> 08:09.157
- You're coming home right now!
- Dr. Maheswaran, you

08:09.225 --> 08:11.125
can't let your husband leave the house!

08:11.193 --> 08:14.596
- He can't drive in the snow!
- What?

08:14.663 --> 08:18.233
- Yes, I can!
- Please trust me!

08:18.300 --> 08:20.735
Hey!

08:23.172 --> 08:25.540
Hold it steady.

08:25.608 --> 08:27.909
We have to send this to the
galaxy warp without

08:27.977 --> 08:29.711
- warping ourselves.
- This is too risky.

08:29.778 --> 08:31.546
No, it's not.
Get over it.

08:31.614 --> 08:34.649
If the shooting star
goes off mid-warp, it could

08:34.717 --> 08:38.152
explode forever in warp space.
And even if we do manage to

08:38.254 --> 08:41.923
destroy the entire galaxy warp,
they could still find

08:41.991 --> 08:44.692
- another way to get here.
- Uhh, whatcha doin'?

08:44.760 --> 08:47.762
- Steven?!
- Pearl! No!

08:50.032 --> 08:52.500
- Mwah.
- Uhhhh...

08:52.718 --> 08:55.686
What?
Garnet, what happened?

08:55.754 --> 08:58.656
I passed my ability
to you for just a moment.

08:58.724 --> 09:01.259
You mean...
I had future visions?

09:01.326 --> 09:04.929
- Tell me what you saw.
- I saw... some good things,

09:05.030 --> 09:09.133
- but mostly bad things.
- And now you can

09:09.234 --> 09:11.069
- make the right choice.
- Hmm.

09:11.136 --> 09:15.206
Connie, we have to
go right this instant.

09:15.274 --> 09:17.809
Would you look at this?
An entire inch of snow.

09:17.876 --> 09:19.093
Dad, there's no time!

09:19.094 --> 09:22.000
- We got to go now!
- Wha-huh?!

09:29.888 --> 09:32.090
Connie!
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

09:32.191 --> 09:35.768
- Nice sweatshirt, Greg.
- Oh, thanks.

09:42.768 --> 09:45.169
Well, we better get going.

09:45.237 --> 09:47.939
Bye, Connie.
Sorry we can't stay

09:48.040 --> 09:50.441
- and watch the snow.
- Yeah.

09:50.509 --> 09:52.743
It's starting to get pretty
bad out there.

09:52.811 --> 09:55.146
I don't know if you
Universes should be

09:55.214 --> 09:57.048
- driving in this weather.
- Why don't you both

09:57.149 --> 09:58.449
stay here tonight?

09:58.517 --> 10:00.952
- Really?!
- Wow, Mom.

10:01.019 --> 10:05.756
- That's... really cool.
- It's... just safer that way.

10:05.824 --> 10:07.925
We Maheswarans are all about safety.

10:07.993 --> 10:10.995
- I'll make up the couch.
- A couch?

10:11.063 --> 10:15.421
Ooh la la!
ChÃ£Â¢teau Maheswaran!
