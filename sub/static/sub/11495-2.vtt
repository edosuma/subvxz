00:05.330 --> 00:06.600
Good morning.

00:06.602 --> 00:08.870
Top of the morning to you, sir.

00:08.872 --> 00:10.903
Oh, God.
Did you have a stroke?

00:12.026 --> 00:13.352
Oh, no, no stroke.

00:13.354 --> 00:14.786
I'm bleaching my teeth.

00:14.788 --> 00:16.152
What?

00:17.185 --> 00:18.615
Sorry. I'm bleaching my teeth.

00:18.617 --> 00:20.709
Oh.

00:22.403 --> 00:23.667
And what are you up to?

00:23.669 --> 00:25.497
Nothing.
Just reading the news.

00:25.499 --> 00:28.326
Mmm. Me, too, old-school.

00:29.962 --> 00:32.097
Anything interesting
over there?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.067
Just reading an article
about how

00:34.069 --> 00:36.702
home teeth-whitening systems
might cause mouth cancer.

00:39.935 --> 00:42.803
Really?
No, of course not.

00:45.072 --> 00:46.838
Why are you even
bothering with that thing?

00:46.840 --> 00:50.432
Walden, I get rejected by women
for 100 different reasons.

00:50.434 --> 00:53.035
Whiter teeth would make it 99.

00:55.539 --> 00:57.038
Zoey?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.374
Oh. Hi, Ava.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.208
Good morning, Walden.

01:01.210 --> 01:04.277
What a great surprise.
What are you doing?

01:04.279 --> 01:07.013
I wanted to invite you
to my birthday party.

01:07.015 --> 01:09.816
That is so sweet.

01:10.819 --> 01:13.720
Uh, but I don't know if I can.

01:13.722 --> 01:15.089
Why not?

01:15.091 --> 01:16.491
Well...

01:17.527 --> 01:18.661
Oh, boy.

01:18.663 --> 01:19.962
Uh, is your mom there?

01:19.964 --> 01:21.530
She's taking a shower.

01:21.532 --> 01:22.665
Maybe, when she gets out,

01:22.667 --> 01:24.367
you could ask her
if I can come.

01:24.369 --> 01:27.070
Why? It's not her birthday.

01:27.072 --> 01:30.507
Oh, this is breaking my heart.

01:31.343 --> 01:32.877
Here's the thing, Ava.

01:32.879 --> 01:35.680
I'm not your mom's
boyfriend anymore.

01:35.682 --> 01:36.981
I know that.

01:36.983 --> 01:39.183
She's in the shower
with Peter.

01:43.487 --> 01:46.322
Kids say the darnedest things.

01:49.827 --> 01:51.895
Okay, I'll tell you what, Ava.

01:51.897 --> 01:54.698
Uh, why don't you let me
talk to your mom

01:54.700 --> 01:56.767
and we'll figure
something out.

01:56.769 --> 01:58.735
Okay. I love you, Walden.

01:58.737 --> 02:00.103
I love you, too.

02:00.105 --> 02:02.139
Good-bye.
Bye.

02:06.644 --> 02:08.645
Damn it.

02:08.646 --> 02:12.182
I can't believe she's sleeping
with this guy already.

02:12.184 --> 02:13.884
Well, we don't know that.

02:13.886 --> 02:17.121
All we know is they're in
the shower together.

02:17.956 --> 02:19.623
You're not helping.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.158
Sorry.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.927
Hey, I know what
will cheer you up.

02:23.929 --> 02:25.929
A whiter smile.

02:26.898 --> 02:27.965
I've got another bleaching tray.

02:27.967 --> 02:28.965
How about it?

02:28.967 --> 02:30.033
No.

02:30.035 --> 02:31.134
You sure?

02:31.136 --> 02:32.368
You know what they say.

02:32.370 --> 02:36.405
A million-dollar smile
gathers a lot of interest.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.641
Who says that?

02:38.643 --> 02:42.010
It's the slogan on the box.

02:42.012 --> 02:43.912
At least I think it is.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.081
My Spanish is a little shaky.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.983
I'll pass.

02:47.985 --> 02:49.317
You sure?

02:49.319 --> 02:50.919
Might get your mind off of Zoey.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.555
My mind is not on Zoey.

02:52.557 --> 02:54.256
Okay, fine.

02:59.829 --> 03:01.930
You need to stop parking
your car in the garage.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.732
Really? How come?

03:03.734 --> 03:05.066
It's leaking oil.

03:05.068 --> 03:06.301
Oh, I don't think so.

03:06.303 --> 03:09.071
I haven't put oil in it
in two years.

03:09.073 --> 03:10.473
Well, it's leaking something.

03:10.475 --> 03:12.508
Well, why don't I just
put down some cardboard?

03:12.510 --> 03:13.843
Why don't you just
put it on the street?

03:13.845 --> 03:16.445
Oh, no, the salty sea air
is very corrosive.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.281
It'll hurt the blue book value.

03:18.283 --> 03:21.451
Alan, you drive a 13-year-old
Volvo station wagon

03:21.453 --> 03:23.953
with a quarter of a million
miles on it.

03:23.955 --> 03:26.456
The blue book
has more value than your car.

03:27.325 --> 03:29.159
Well, okay, but I-I...

03:29.161 --> 03:30.960
No buts.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.162
You put your car on the street

03:32.164 --> 03:33.930
or I'll put your ass
on the street.

03:39.036 --> 03:40.703
What a colossal douche.

03:40.705 --> 03:41.971
What?

03:41.973 --> 03:44.540

Hey.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.298
Hey.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.933
I want to apologize

04:27.935 --> 04:29.701
for going off on you
this morning.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.236
No need.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.671
Really?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.105
Water under the bridge.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.709
Which, coincidentally,
is where I had to park my car.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.444
Well, I appreciate that.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.213
And, uh, just FYI,
pigeons nest under there.

04:42.215 --> 04:46.051
My car already looks like
it's covered in mashed potatoes.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.186
I'll get it washed for you.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.988
It'll need detailing.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.590
No problem.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.859
And oil.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.196
Sure.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.899
We good?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.036
Yeah, I suppose.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.572
Now, show me that
million-peso smile.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.008
Oh, no, I...
you can't really tell.

05:09.010 --> 05:10.543
Ah, come on.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.283
Wow. Nice.

05:16.285 --> 05:18.318
It's like
a movie star's smile.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.319
You think? You think?

05:19.321 --> 05:20.854
Yeah, they look
like little Chiclets.

05:20.856 --> 05:22.922
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah.

05:22.924 --> 05:26.192
Hey, I'm really sorry
about the whole car thing.

05:27.228 --> 05:30.263
This breakup's got me
a little crazy.

05:30.265 --> 05:31.398
Oh, I understand.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.733
When my wife left me,
I had a lot of anger.

05:33.735 --> 05:35.035
Of course, I internalized it,

05:35.037 --> 05:37.337
which led to a lot
of hair in the sink

05:37.339 --> 05:39.173
and blood in the toilet.

05:39.175 --> 05:42.376
So you know what it's like
to love someone so much

05:42.378 --> 05:44.544
that your heart feels
like it's going to explode

05:44.546 --> 05:46.613
from your chest
with pure happiness.

05:46.615 --> 05:49.049
Oh, God, no. I was just pissed
off about losing the house.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.585
My point is that...

05:51.587 --> 05:52.986
that everybody has problems,

05:52.988 --> 05:55.622
but what's important
is how you deal with them.

05:55.624 --> 05:57.557
Here, let me
get that for you.

05:57.559 --> 05:59.292
See, the key is,

05:59.294 --> 06:01.461
you got to tap it
in the right spot.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.931
It's not...
Oh.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.567
It's okay. I-I got it.
No, no.

06:06.569 --> 06:08.636
I can get it.

06:08.638 --> 06:10.637
What the hell?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.607
Son of a bitch!

06:13.609 --> 06:15.041
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

06:15.043 --> 06:16.209
No, it's not.

06:16.211 --> 06:17.977
I want ketchup,
and I can't have it.

06:17.979 --> 06:19.479
Calm down.
It's just a condiment.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.914
Choose me, damn it!

06:20.916 --> 06:22.515
Choose me!

06:22.517 --> 06:24.717
Okay, we're-we're not talking
about ketchup anymore, are we?

06:24.719 --> 06:25.952
What else would we...

06:25.954 --> 06:28.555
be talking about?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.658
Okay.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.160
Uh, here, let me
help you clean that up.

06:34.162 --> 06:35.895
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about it.

06:35.897 --> 06:36.830
You know what? Here.

06:36.832 --> 06:38.064
Give me your...
your shirt and pants,

06:38.066 --> 06:39.232
and I'll throw them
in the washer.

06:39.234 --> 06:40.400
Oh, that's not necessary,
actually.

06:40.402 --> 06:42.503
Give me your shirt and pants!

06:42.505 --> 06:44.004
Okay. Okay.

06:44.006 --> 06:47.074
Oh, uh, don't wash the
shirt with the pants,

06:47.076 --> 06:49.777
'cause it's off brand
and the colors tend to run.

06:49.779 --> 06:51.979
Oh, and, uh... and wash
the pants in cold water.

06:51.981 --> 06:54.215
Okay.
They shrink in warm water.

06:54.217 --> 06:56.250
Of course, that's funny
because, uh,

06:56.252 --> 06:57.518
I shrink in cold water.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.153
Just give me
your stupid clothes!

06:59.155 --> 07:00.588
Hey, here, here.

07:00.590 --> 07:02.723
Thank you.

07:05.493 --> 07:08.562
I am so back in the garage.

07:11.801 --> 07:13.801
Oh...

07:13.803 --> 07:16.303
Perfect. Um...

07:17.606 --> 07:19.006
Coming!

07:19.008 --> 07:21.441
Uh...

07:21.443 --> 07:25.412
With any luck, it'll be
a door-to-door ketchup salesman.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.352
Oh, Robin.

07:33.354 --> 07:35.020
Hello, Alan.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.223
Sorry. Uh, come on in.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.660
Walden, your mom's here!

07:40.662 --> 07:43.196
Be right there!

07:43.198 --> 07:44.631
So, nice to see you.

07:44.633 --> 07:48.002
Well, it's nice to see...
so much of you.

07:48.004 --> 07:50.770
Your son insisted
I take off my clothes

07:50.772 --> 07:52.739
after he soiled them.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.042
That sounded weird, didn't it?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.378
So, uh...
so, what brings you by?

07:58.380 --> 08:00.013
Walden's taking me to lunch.

08:00.015 --> 08:01.081
Oh, lovely.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.216
I enjoy the occasional lunch
with my mom.

08:03.218 --> 08:06.186
Really?
As one enjoys the occasional colonoscopy.

08:08.190 --> 08:10.190
Walden!

08:10.192 --> 08:11.892
Sorry.

08:11.894 --> 08:13.160
Let's go.

08:13.162 --> 08:14.494
I'll drive.
Okay.

08:14.496 --> 08:16.029
Oh, bon appétit.

08:16.031 --> 08:18.598
Bye.
Bye.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.001
Everything about that man
is disturbing.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.672
Nice to see you again.

08:25.674 --> 08:27.007
Oh, look.

08:27.009 --> 08:29.376
New yellow pages.

08:30.278 --> 08:32.611
Oh, man.

08:33.715 --> 08:35.549
Oh, boy.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.317
Uh, Berta!
Yeah?

08:37.318 --> 08:39.152
I'm locked out.

08:39.154 --> 08:40.787
Hang on.

08:40.789 --> 08:43.590
Hurry up! I don't have
any clothes on!

08:49.431 --> 08:51.398
Hello?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.866
Berta?

08:52.868 --> 08:55.602
Oh, come on!

08:57.472 --> 08:58.672
This is nice.

08:58.674 --> 08:59.906
You and I
haven't gone out

08:59.908 --> 09:01.775
for a bite to eat
in a long time.

09:01.777 --> 09:02.909
Yeah.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.911
It's a shame Zoey
couldn't join us.

09:04.913 --> 09:06.346
Mm-hmm.

09:06.348 --> 09:08.214
How's she doing?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.349
Fine.

09:10.351 --> 09:11.550
Good. I'm glad.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.751
She's a great gal.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.887
You don't want to let
that one get away.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.223
Right.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.459
How old is her daughter?
Eight?

09:20.461 --> 09:21.827
She's almost nine.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.295
When's her birthday?

09:23.297 --> 09:24.630
Few days.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.466
Oh, fun.
Is there going to be a party?

09:26.468 --> 09:28.434
Yeah.

09:28.436 --> 09:30.470
You know, for one
of your birthdays,

09:30.472 --> 09:32.138
I got you a bouncy castle.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.272
Do you remember?

09:33.274 --> 09:34.507
I do.

09:34.509 --> 09:36.942
You should get one of those
for Zoey's daughter.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.677
That's a good idea.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.746
Oh, and take
lots of pictures.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.183
Those are the moments
you remember forever.

09:46.087 --> 09:47.954
What... what's happening?

09:47.956 --> 09:49.355
We're out of gas.

09:49.357 --> 09:51.657
We just passed a station.
