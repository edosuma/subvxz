That's us.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
Not to question
your brother's strategy,

36:37.960 --> 36:39.120
but it might be nice
to have something

36:39.120 --> 36:40.790
before I take out a Seelie...

36:43.120 --> 36:45.710
He made me promise not to
arm you until the last second.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.960
What's going on?
Why are they going after Jace?

36:57.960 --> 37:00.040
Because he's a traitor.
He's been using a Seelie ring

37:00.040 --> 37:02.920
to foil our plan.
No...

37:02.920 --> 37:05.040
GUARD: You're not
going anywhere.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.960
This is our chance
to get to the Queen;

37:06.960 --> 37:08.880
o get our family sword!

37:08.880 --> 37:11.920
Who do you trust? Me or Jace?

(RISING MUSIC)

37:19.170 --> 37:20.750
Clary, stick to the plan!

37:20.750 --> 37:21.790
I can't let him die!

37:21.790 --> 37:24.120
I swear to you, he is
against us, not with us!

37:26.960 --> 37:28.710
JACE!

38:21.790 --> 38:23.120
Jonathan says you're
wearing a Seelie ring.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.830
Are you trying to take me
away from my brother?

38:27.830 --> 38:29.830
Hey! Hey! Listen to me!

38:29.830 --> 38:31.750
I'm trying to save you!

38:32.250 --> 38:34.960
This isn't who you are, Clary!
Come home with me!

38:36.750 --> 38:38.880
This is who I am.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.210
You try and take me
from my brother again...

38:42.210 --> 38:43.830
I will end you!

Jace!

38:55.920 --> 38:58.120
Jace, what happened?
Where's Clary?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.830
I lost her.

39:29.830 --> 39:31.170
Alec.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.210
I gave back your magic...

39:37.210 --> 39:40.830
so you'd be strong. Not weak.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.040
Leave me alone.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.790
I'm in enough pain
without you causing me more.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.210
Pain is the path
to enlightenment.

39:54.830 --> 39:56.000
I know...

39:56.000 --> 39:58.080
because losing you

39:58.080 --> 40:00.880
is what made me realize

40:00.880 --> 40:03.120
that my son's love

40:03.120 --> 40:05.330
is all that matters to me.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.080
Don't pretend to care about me!

40:07.080 --> 40:09.250
You never have! You never will.

40:10.250 --> 40:11.960
If that were true,

40:11.960 --> 40:14.250
I'd let you make this mistake

40:14.250 --> 40:16.290
instead of trying to stop you.

40:17.330 --> 40:21.210
This Shadowhunter you loved...

40:22.290 --> 40:25.170
...the heartache you're feeling,

40:25.170 --> 40:26.830
fight through it!

40:27.920 --> 40:29.210
No matter how painful,

40:29.210 --> 40:31.080
those memories...

40:32.080 --> 40:34.000
...will make you wiser.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
You see that?
