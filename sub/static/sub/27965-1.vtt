01:16.844 --> 01:17.678
Fuck.

01:21.149 --> 01:21.982
So where are we?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.017
One moment.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.988
No phones please.

01:29.990 --> 01:30.922
Come on.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.491
You know the rules.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.895
This is taking forever,
I'm late for somethin'

01:36.264 --> 01:37.996
There's nothing more important
than you covering your ass

01:37.998 --> 01:39.931
before you sign on
this dotted line,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.603
so what it is that you late
for, I'm sure it can wait.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.517
I gotta' take this.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.590
I am sorry.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.693
Have you thought about what
we talked about the last time?

02:07.695 --> 02:09.294
Dominik's a grown man.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.461
I'm not his keeper.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.530
No, but he's you're
his best friend

02:11.532 --> 02:12.833
and he'll listen to you.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.702
This is awkward, but
he's hurting your career.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.304
It's because of
him I have a career.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.805
Whatever it is you
think you owe him,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.307
you repaid him years ago.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.542
He was irresponsible
and unpredictable

02:23.544 --> 02:25.511
when he gave you those
records on your wall.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.778
Why does it matter now?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.547
You know, music is
a young man's game.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.481
No shit.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.682
You want to play in the game,

02:30.684 --> 02:31.850
you gotta' start
making people happy.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.018
You can't be pulling
this attitude.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.886
Fine, I'll talk to him.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.723
When?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.227
So, what'd I miss?

02:41.229 --> 02:42.027
We're done.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.197
Great, gotta jet.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.102
The longer you wait,
the more money you lose.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.879
So what's so important
you had to bolt the meeting?

02:59.747 --> 03:00.612
It's personal.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.547
Fisk is pissed.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.948
Ha, I could give a shit.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.517
You should give a
shit, he gets us gigs.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.018
He's our employee.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.857
If it wasn't for us he'd be
writing wills for blue hairs.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.293
Do you have any plans
this weekend after the mix?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.061
I think so.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.263
Can you break them?

03:17.265 --> 03:18.098
Why would I?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.301
Call it a work retreat.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.502
We talking Cabo?

03:23.504 --> 03:25.273
The location is a surprise.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.607
Who's invited?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.443
You and me.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.445
Fine, send me directions.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.447
Better yet, come
out with us tonight.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.315
Out where?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.249
Flats.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.950
I have no idea what that is.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.753
It's a fucking club, you twat.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.355
Drop the tweed jacket
and come out with us.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.727
Who's going to finish the
mix if I'm out at the club?

03:48.161 --> 03:50.161
If you want me to come on
your little work retreat,

03:50.163 --> 03:51.632
you come to the club with me.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.769
Change out of that

04:08.849 --> 04:09.683
Whoa.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.018
So, where to?

04:13.020 --> 04:13.854
After party.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.457
Fuck, where's my fucking phone?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.558
E, where's my phone?

04:19.560 --> 04:20.394
I don't know.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.127
Give me yours

04:22.129 --> 04:22.963
I'm busy.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.697
Who is that guy?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.867
He's my button
pusher, knob turner.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.869
Yeah, I was wondering.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.671
I thought he might be
your personal assistant,

04:32.673 --> 04:33.507
like you know.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.709
Invaluable things,
personal assistants.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.210
If I could find
my bleedin' phone,

04:39.212 --> 04:42.280
I might call her up and ask
her where this after party is.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.114
Eddie?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.049
What?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.216
Where the fuck we going?

04:45.218 --> 04:46.385
I'm going home.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.389
You two can do whatever
the fuck you like.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.767
Sorry, he's not
a morning person.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.968
He probably had a
late night last night.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.640
Ah, it's not a problem,
you got me for the day.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.443
So, you are gonna'
miss poker tomorrow.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.711
I know.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.779
Oh, don't tell me
you're getting tired

05:13.781 --> 05:15.113
of stealing my money.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.717
I'm paying you $1,400
an hour to fly us.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.519
Who's stealing from whom?

05:20.521 --> 05:23.722
Hey, I'm giving you
the friends discount.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.923
Discount?

05:27.395 --> 05:30.095
Did you put the rendezvous
point in your GPS?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.630
Yep.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.832
Your phones won't work.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.200
You wannna borrow my SAT phone?

05:35.202 --> 05:36.036
It'll be fine.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.573
Look, it's rough
terrain, just take it, huh?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.576
I'll sleep better.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.213
This is him.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.279
I guess he brought a friend

05:48.281 --> 05:49.114
Five hours.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.616
Five hours is not bad.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.150
No, no, and then I get
home and then you're gone,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.553
'cause you're out partying
with that British dude

05:54.555 --> 05:56.988
who you've never even
introduced me to,

05:56.990 --> 05:58.189
Whatever.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.658
What's up, we late?

05:59.660 --> 06:00.859
It's fine,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.528
James, this is
Dominik, my partner.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.595
Hey.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.397
And this is?

06:05.399 --> 06:06.498
Lora, hi.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.333
Hi.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.167
Nice to meet you

06:09.169 --> 06:10.001
Nice to meet you.

06:10.003 --> 06:10.836
Lora.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.670
Hi, Lora.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.504
Hi.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.705
Are we all going?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.640
I thought you said
there was just

06:14.642 --> 06:15.173
going to be two passengers.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.408
Yeah.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.643
When I said it was
a work retreat,

06:17.645 --> 06:19.177
I thought it was going
to be the two of us.

06:19.179 --> 06:23.348
Uh, that's my fault,
I asked if I could come.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.916
Her fault.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.718
What's the problem
man, look there's room.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.686
Sure.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.887
May I take your bags, miss?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.622
Oh, why thank you.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.495
It was supposed to
be just the two of us.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.196
I know man, she's
been bothering me

06:38.198 --> 06:40.432
to spend more time
with her, so I figured,

06:40.434 --> 06:41.835
you know, kill two birds.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.972
So where to, captain?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.106
Let's find
a place to camp.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.708
Camp?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.209
Christ.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.478
Did you think we were going
to find a day spa out here?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.980
A man can hope.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.518
Why haven't you changed your
clothes, at least the shoes?

08:05.986 --> 08:09.320
Didn't really have time, we
were till what, six or seven?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.822
I don't know, it
was fucking late.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.958
We threw some shit in
our bags and here we are.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.859
So you haven't slept?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.260
Fuck man, relax.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.996
Yeah relax, it's vacation.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.731
Or something like that.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.299
There's a clearing up
here, we can set up camp.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.368
It's not far from a river.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.971
Tell me you brought two tents.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.440
I brought two tents, okay?

08:28.375 --> 08:29.242
God.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.578
So we're here for a few days.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.346
What's the plan?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.749
No plan, no agenda.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.586
Woo, no complaints from me.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.986
You married, Eddie?

08:41.989 --> 08:44.054
Ha, he's divorced.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.693
Awe, spending time with
two attractive single men.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.929
That sounds like a party.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.608
Mmm, that smells great.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.342
Just sticking a
brat, help yourself.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.178
Thanks.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.613
You don't happen
to have a six pack

09:07.615 --> 09:09.815
in that magic duffel
bag of yours do you?

09:09.817 --> 09:10.818
Six pack of water.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.988
Did you bring
anything to drink, baby?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.026
Like a fucking boy scout.

09:21.028 --> 09:21.862
Yes.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.097
Oof, what is this, kerosine?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.901
Try some, you'll like it.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.305
Mm-hmm.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.175
So what is this place?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.143
The North.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.678
You know what she means.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.012
Why here?

09:41.014 --> 09:41.849
It's remote.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.482
I used to go camping
when I was a kid,

09:44.484 --> 09:45.817
with my dad, you know?

09:45.819 --> 09:46.752
Out here?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.553
No, back home, back east.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.091
When you're off the grid
you got less distractions.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.392
That's why you were
giving me the evil eye

09:54.394 --> 09:57.397
in the helicopter,
I'm a distraction.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.834
He's right, you
do distract me.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.335
Even in this sweatshirt.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.238
I'm sorry, Lora,
this isn't a party.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.075
This is work, your man
should have left you at home.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.242
Ouch.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.845
Hey, show some
respect for my guest.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.813
You're right.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.414
Lora, this isn't your fault.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.351
Dominik just made
a poor decision.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.380
Do you
mind if I join you?

11:22.382 --> 11:23.216
Please.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.854
Sorry I haven't been
a more gracious host.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.088
I was raised to
have better manners.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.623
It's okay, I won't
tell your mother.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.327
Besides, he can
drive me nuts too.

11:35.996 --> 11:36.828
Is he sleeping?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.096
Yeah, he cashed out.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.732
I don't know how many
days he's been awake.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.734
How's he find time to work?

11:42.736 --> 11:43.536
Exactly.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.939
He gets it done though.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.108
I suppose.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.109
If he frustrates you so much

11:51.111 --> 11:52.645
then why you still his partner?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.048
Long story.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.852
Does it look like I
have anywhere to go?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.254
I'm a captive audience.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.526
15 years ago or more,

12:07.995 --> 12:10.998
we were unknowns, Dominik
meets this girl in a bar.

12:11.999 --> 12:12.798
Of course.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.365
It was Sadie.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.035
Oh right, you produced
her her first album.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.469
That's right.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.737
Yeah, she was shopping around
for producers at the time,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.973
relative unknown herself,

12:21.975 --> 12:24.009
but she had the financial
backing of a major,

12:24.011 --> 12:24.910
which meant...

12:24.912 --> 12:26.144
Money.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.578
More money than
we were used to,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.181
so we listened to her demos
and they were amazing,

12:30.183 --> 12:32.951
but when we met her,
Dominik sort of lied

12:32.953 --> 12:36.822
and said they were total
crap and I guarantee

12:36.824 --> 12:39.357
you no one ever talked
to her like that before.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.526
She seemed like she
was about to cry.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.231
But, I think part of her
respected him for it.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.834
Why did he lie?

12:48.468 --> 12:49.567
I don't know.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.138
Following his instincts I guess.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.772
He knew if we
didn't set ourselves

12:54.774 --> 12:57.442
apart from other producers,
we wouldn't get the gig.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.145
So she sucked up her pride

13:00.147 --> 13:02.814
and asked him what he
would do different.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.815
And?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.217
He said, "Give us 24 hours,"

13:06.219 --> 13:08.653
and he whipped up Dark Days.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.787
In 24 hours?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.158
Well, the backbone of it.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.894
He was a machine.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.928
He's got a gift.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.231
Well, he's got something

14:02.342 --> 14:05.343
Isn't it a little
early for that?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.878
Go back to sleep.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.070
Morning.

14:32.072 --> 14:32.906
Morning, man.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.642
You still pissed?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.246
I'm not pissed.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.949
It's just why couldn't you
take this retreat seriously?

14:43.951 --> 14:47.218
I like Lora and all, but it's
not supposed to be a party.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.153
What did Fisk say to you?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.621
It's not Fisk, Dominik.

14:50.623 --> 14:54.325
The phones haven't been
ringing the way they used to,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.227
LRG was two years ago
and that's an eternity

14:56.229 --> 14:57.097
in the pop world.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.099
Hey, we'll survive.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.602
We won't unless we adapt.

15:03.836 --> 15:04.804
Morning, boys.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.507
Kids adapt to me, I set
the fucking trends, E.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.610
Listen to yourself.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.612
Okay, you know what.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.714
If we're gonna be here
all weekend long together,

15:16.716 --> 15:18.751
you two better
fucking lighten up.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.492
So, what is there
to do around here?

15:30.263 --> 15:34.001
Well, we got the
woods all around us.

15:35.002 --> 15:35.835
Let's explore,

15:37.570 --> 15:39.070
I'm game.

15:39.072 --> 15:39.906
Babe?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.075
Whatever.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.426
I found
this path yesterday.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.995
Oh, is this an animal trail?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.763
No, it's too defined.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.765
Who the fuck else
would be out here?

16:07.767 --> 16:08.668
Hunters.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.569
Is it hunting season?

16:11.571 --> 16:14.174
Not for deer, but
for other animals maybe.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.309
They said there would be anyone
around this time of year.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.677
Who said that?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.581
The state,
I just bought it.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.449
What, this land?

16:24.451 --> 16:25.283
Yeah.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.117
All of it

16:26.119 --> 16:28.019
Jesus dude, why?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.687
It's beautiful.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.590
It's nature.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.325
They told me there's a
waterfall on it somewhere.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.893
Oh my gosh,
what's it called?

16:35.895 --> 16:36.994
I don't know.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.229
Can we see it?

16:38.231 --> 16:41.099
I have no idea where
it is unfortunately.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.670
Of course, the one fucking
thing I'd want to see.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.038
Okay, all right,
tomorrow morning,

16:47.040 --> 16:49.274
we'll wake up bright and
early, go for another hike

16:49.276 --> 16:51.244
and find the waterfall,
if you behave.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.578
Fat chance.

16:55.115 --> 16:55.948
Listen.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.790
No ringing, no buzzing,
nothing electrical.

17:06.292 --> 17:07.258
Peace.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.492
Jesus.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.261
No clubs,
no bars, no computers.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.231
I get it now, is
this an intervention?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.665
You know, some people do
actually enjoy going camping

17:15.667 --> 17:17.036
and spending time outdoors.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.170
It's not so bad.

17:19.172 --> 17:19.970
See?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.172
Yeah.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.473
My ray of sunshine.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.222
Oh my God, we're gonna
sleep really well tonight.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.823
Isn't it time for lunch?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.057
Yeah, shit man.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.259
I hope you brought
more food than this.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.495
This will work.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.530
Work for what?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.798
Maybe I
will catch us dinner.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.500
You're such a goddamn nerd.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.269
You know you can
join me if you want.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.204
I could probably fashion a rod

17:53.206 --> 17:55.375
out of a tree branch,
I brought extra line.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.847
We could be in Cabo.

18:02.849 --> 18:03.814
Don't tease.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.084
Who's teasing?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.820
So, where
did you two meet?

18:09.822 --> 18:11.789
We were
roommates in college.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.091
He's always been kind of
like a brother, you know?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.948
You seem to be
in a better mood.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.985
It's the afternoon,
I'm finally awake.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.454
I think it's more than that.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.988
Don't analyze me.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.857
Don't bully me.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.957
I think Eddie was right.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.828
This place really
kind of cools you out.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.029
This is
fine for a few hours,

18:52.031 --> 18:53.698
but I'm sure I'm
gonna' be pulling

18:53.700 --> 18:55.966
my hair out by the
end of the week.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.069
And he was also right
that I shouldn't be here.

18:59.071 --> 19:02.240
You know what, fuck
him, he was cryptic.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.709
He didn't give me
any ground rules.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.110
I know, what is done
is done, I'm here.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.745
I'm just saying the two of you

19:07.747 --> 19:10.250
should at least get some
alone time, you know?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.552
Alone time?

19:14.187 --> 19:17.188
You know what I mean, I saw
you guys banter back there.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.023
It was like you were old friends

19:19.025 --> 19:21.058
and now you're away
from all that music.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.560
I feel like it just might work.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.661
What might work?

19:23.663 --> 19:24.995
Eddie's not an idiot.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.931
He chose this place
because he knows

19:26.933 --> 19:29.066
that it'll help him
reconnect with you again.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.501
Did he tell you this?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.872
No, but what do you think
a work retreat is for?

19:34.241 --> 19:37.242
I dunno' to expense
laps, dinners, and hookers.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.844
It's like talking
to a brick wall.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.580
You asked, hey.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.783
Hey, come on, what
are you pissed?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.585
I'm fine.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.489
You're just
exhausting sometimes.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.265
What?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.334
What is it?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.335
I smell something.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.936
Is there a punchline coming?

20:05.938 --> 20:06.906
No, it's...

20:08.107 --> 20:09.141
You don't smell that?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.045
Yeah, I think I do.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.150
I think it's coming
from over here.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.225
All
right, I lost it.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.194
The wind changed.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.163
That's not the wind.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.033
Do you hear that?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.068
Yeah.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.842
Come on let's go see
who's making that noise.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.377
Hey, these people
live in the fucking woods,

20:46.379 --> 20:49.213
Lora, I don't think they
want to be disturbed.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.584
Oh come on, don't be a pussy.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.961
Woah.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.665
Look, someone is living here.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.132
Look, right there.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.636
I see it, it's
a fucking house.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.274
That's a pretty
harsh chemical smell.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.207
Come on, we should leave.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.478
Dano.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.012
Jesus, he's got a gun.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.248
That's fine, everybody out
here is gonna' be packing.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.683
No, let's get the
fuck out of here.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.184
Dano.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.054
Hey.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.057
Hey yourself.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.023
Who are you people.

21:33.025 --> 21:33.858
Who the fuck are you?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.159
You're squatting here.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.561
Sorry, we don't
need to be rude.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.998
Squatting, what the
hell you talking about?

21:40.367 --> 21:42.833
Uh, there's no need for
that, we'll just be on our way.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.935
That's not gonna happen.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.337
Why?

21:46.339 --> 21:48.005
Time to go, Lora.

21:48.007 --> 21:48.808
Lora?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.444
What an average name.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.779
Sorry to bother you,
we'll just be going now.

21:54.781 --> 21:58.385
Oh, you're not going
anywhere, especially not you.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.253
Come here, let me get
a better look at you.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.090
Dano.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.357
Over here.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.257
Come on.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.794
Stop, hey stop!

22:22.809 --> 22:23.843
What was that?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.647
Don't move, you're next.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.316
What happened?

22:32.318 --> 22:34.785
Some hikers took
the wrong path.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.720
How many?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.657
Just this guy and the girl.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.957
You sure?

22:39.959 --> 22:40.893
Yeah.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.932
You got any friends
we need to worry about?

22:47.934 --> 22:48.735
Answer me!

22:51.237 --> 22:53.471
What the fuck, is he
a retard or somethin'?

22:53.473 --> 22:54.974
Are you alone?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.041
Yeah, I'm alone.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.375
Was that so fucking hard?

23:00.447 --> 23:03.981
Go tell Seth, I'll
take care of this one.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.292
Where did the bitch and the
backstreet boy come from?

23:15.294 --> 23:16.126
I don't know.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.294
They just slipped up.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.095
You know
we're gonna' catch hell

23:18.097 --> 23:19.296
for this, don't ya?

23:19.298 --> 23:20.498
You don't
have to tell anybody.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.735
What is this mess?

23:23.870 --> 23:24.802
You got everything
laid out here,

23:24.804 --> 23:26.138
but someone can walk up on.

23:32.044 --> 23:32.879
Fuck.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.283
Morning, sunshine.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.184
What have you done?

23:40.186 --> 23:41.387
Now you're on the floor.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.092
Pick him up.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.165
What you want to do with him?

23:55.167 --> 23:56.901
Looks like an idiot.

23:56.903 --> 23:57.968
Just look at his clothes.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.070
Yeah.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.674
What are you doing
up here, pretty boy.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.810
He's seen the operation.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.345
Kill him.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.582
Wait, wait, wait, you moron

24:11.450 --> 24:14.253
I don't want little pieces
of brain littering my cellar.

24:17.223 --> 24:22.192
First, grab the
girl, dig a big hole,

24:22.194 --> 24:26.330
six feet down, then
take him outside.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.367
Put two bullets in his head.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.135
Don't drag ass.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.137
I want the situation cleaned
up before Big Em gets here.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.208
Yeah boss, wait,
Big Em is comin'?

24:38.110 --> 24:38.945
Help him.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.612
Hop to it.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.089
Just wasn't your day.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.003
Banks.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.841
Yeah?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.076
Get this clean.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.010
I don't want any
trace of the girl

25:13.012 --> 25:14.545
or that asshole in there.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.847
After you're done I want
you to search the area.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.783
I know he said they were alone,

25:18.785 --> 25:20.751
but others are sure to
come looking for them.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.186
Okay.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.022
Banks.

25:25.592 --> 25:29.493
Nothing leads them back
here, do you understand?

25:29.495 --> 25:30.296
Understood.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.211
All right, I'm back.

25:46.646 --> 25:47.912
Miss me?

25:49.181 --> 25:52.683
Oh, can I get you
anything, coffee?

25:52.685 --> 25:54.018
Ho ho?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.756
My boy, Banks, makes
a mean beef jerky.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.492
You like beef jerky?

26:02.561 --> 26:07.566
Ah, I get it, you're
missing your girl.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.770
I miss her too.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.739
I'm gonna be missing
her all night.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.381
You eying that
machete over there?

26:23.683 --> 26:26.819
Here, let me help ya.

26:44.837 --> 26:45.672
Oh shit.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.911
Go on.

26:53.913 --> 26:54.747
Get it.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.650
I took off my gun, see?

27:00.252 --> 27:01.187
Oh, come on.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.520
It'll be fun.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.027
Here, let me help you some more.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.605
Come on, you got it.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.342
Come on, it's right there.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.011
I'll turn my back.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.848
Oh, oh, duh, duh, duh.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.484
Huh.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.254
No?

27:38.557 --> 27:39.892
Damn, all right.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.226
No fun and games today.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.696
I'll be right back.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.565
Don't go anywhere.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.469
Don't go anywhere.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.305
Hey.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.605
What?

27:55.607 --> 27:57.176
Ignorant motherfucker.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.080
There's more guys,

28:03.082 --> 28:04.214
I know, I know.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.617
We have to hurry.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.296
Come on.

28:38.584 --> 28:39.649
Come on, man.

28:39.651 --> 28:40.517
What is it?

28:40.519 --> 28:41.351
My ankle.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.288
Come on, go.

29:02.909 --> 29:03.740
They killed Lora.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.975
I saw.

29:04.977 --> 29:05.910
They'll kill us too if
we don't get moving.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.579
Come on.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.275
What the fuck happened?

29:37.176 --> 29:38.242
They got away.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.743
They?

29:39.745 --> 29:40.577
They who?

29:40.579 --> 29:41.879
There was another guy.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.647
You said it was just
the guy and the girl.

29:43.649 --> 29:44.483
I was wrong.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.117
I clipped one of them.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.319
He jumped in the river.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.821
Why didn't you pursue?

29:50.823 --> 29:55.225
They won't last,
bleeding, cold, now wet.

29:55.227 --> 30:00.232
Get a radio, go find them
and give me regular updates.

30:01.968 --> 30:02.869
Finish this.

30:05.872 --> 30:06.705
Yeah, boss.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.622
Let me take a look at you.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.321
Dom?

30:56.388 --> 30:57.523
Dom, stay with me, man.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.897
This will keep you warm.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.537
Come on, we gotta get going.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.442
Come on, we gotta go, gotta go.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.026
Let's stop here for a second.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.968
What the fuck
were you thinking?

31:43.970 --> 31:44.801
What?

31:44.803 --> 31:45.869
With this weekend.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.204
I don't know.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.805
I mean, why are we here

31:48.807 --> 31:50.307
and who are those fucking guys?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.977
Look, I thought this
space would be ours, okay?

31:52.979 --> 31:54.478
I thought we could
spend some time together

31:54.480 --> 31:56.981
and work out some shit.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.450
She's fucking dead, Eddie

32:00.953 --> 32:02.286
and we're fucking lost.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.120
We're not lost.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.054
Then where are we?

32:04.056 --> 32:05.057
I didn't shoot her, okay?

32:06.392 --> 32:08.692
All we can do now is try
to survive the night.

32:08.694 --> 32:11.163
I'm sure those assholes are
out there looking for us.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.400
Thanks for the bandage.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.503
It's not gonna last.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.305
We need a real med
kit, some new bandages,

32:21.307 --> 32:22.774
and a way to close the wound.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.379
Can you make it up a tree?

32:40.826 --> 32:42.326
Okay.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.230
Just try to rest up
for a while, okay?

32:46.732 --> 32:47.533
I'm thirsty.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.418
Keep it, keep it.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.059
You know, I wasn't
even gonna come.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.894
She had to talk me into it.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.299
Figured we were going
to that studio in Cabo.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.238
She was so excited.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.181
Those fucking assholes
are gonna pay.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.383
We got to get to the SAT
phone and call in the cavalry.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.887
Just try to be
quiet for a second.

34:14.953 --> 34:15.786
Fuck.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.690
What was your name again?

34:22.994 --> 34:24.728
Dominik.

34:24.730 --> 34:28.065
Hello, Dominik, do
you remember mine?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.400
Of course.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.304
Then what is it?

34:33.539 --> 34:34.373
Why the test?

34:35.541 --> 34:38.074
Because I don't think
you're being honest.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.510
At least I was being honest.

34:40.512 --> 34:44.148
You are the girl from the bar.

34:44.150 --> 34:44.983
Asshole

34:48.554 --> 34:50.556
It's Lora, with an O.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.860
Yeah, what's my last name?

34:56.862 --> 34:58.495
You didn't tell me.

34:58.497 --> 34:59.963
Oh.

34:59.965 --> 35:00.999
You're probably right.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.236
Well?

35:05.471 --> 35:06.703
Well what?

35:06.705 --> 35:08.037
What the fuck's
your last name?

35:08.039 --> 35:09.875
Well you got me
all nervous now.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.512
Boyne

35:14.946 --> 35:15.879
Lora Boyne?

35:15.881 --> 35:16.680
What?

35:16.682 --> 35:19.185
Yes, Boyne, it's Irish.

35:20.386 --> 35:23.687
It means foolish, which
seems pretty appropriate

35:23.689 --> 35:24.523
for right now.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.893
Lora Boyne.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.831
My name is Lora with an O

35:33.865 --> 35:35.901
and I ain't your average ho.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.805
Last name is Boyne.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.109
Make you feel good
in your groin.

35:47.746 --> 35:51.248
That needs work.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.984
Are you sure you write songs?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.823
When can I see you again?

35:58.824 --> 35:59.691
This is over?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.928
I thought we were
just getting started.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.591
Eddie?

36:34.593 --> 36:35.427
Eddie?

37:12.197 --> 37:13.497
Fuck.

37:13.499 --> 37:14.666
Find anything?

37:15.867 --> 37:16.702
No.

37:18.003 --> 37:18.837
God damnit.

37:41.059 --> 37:41.891
Hey.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.726
Hey.

37:42.728 --> 37:43.595
Where'd you go?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.129
I went back to camp.

37:46.131 --> 37:46.998
They were there.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.566
No med kit?

37:49.568 --> 37:50.736
No med kit.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.540
Let me help you down, think
I found a better spot.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.958
We can at least stay
warm for a few moments,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.762
maybe try to dry
out our clothes.

38:22.133 --> 38:22.968
How you feel?

38:24.770 --> 38:26.338
Cold, dizzy.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.744
God, you're sweaty, feverish.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.815
I should probably take
a look at your wound.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.218
We're gonna have to
take the bullet out.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.889
I don't think
that's necessary.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.222
Just do it.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.056
Please.

38:47.058 --> 38:47.893
How?

38:49.828 --> 38:50.729
With that knife.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.539
You sure?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.410
How hard can it be, right?

39:09.147 --> 39:11.347
You still have that flask?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.250
Check your bag.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.823
It's almost full.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.324
Yeah.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.729
We didn't have a whole lot
to celebrate yesterday.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.364
You're gonna' need it.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.809
You too.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.717
You sleepy?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.786
Yeah, well I
stood guard all night.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.087
Bullshit.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.255
How would you know?

39:52.257 --> 39:54.424
I heard you snoring
like my Pa Pa.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.260
Your what?

39:56.127 --> 39:56.995
My grandpa.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.464
Man, the less you
talk the better.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.866
What, It's not my fault
those hikers found us.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.734
No, but you let
that one escape.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.570
His friend blindsided me.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.508
Oh shit.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.480
This ain't gonna' be good.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.683
You think Big Em
knows I let that guy go?

40:19.685 --> 40:20.717
Take one guess.

40:20.719 --> 40:21.520
I don't know.

40:22.888 --> 40:26.858
Well, take my fucking
advice, keep your mouth shut.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.328
How many
are we looking at?

40:32.330 --> 40:33.530
Two escaped.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.464
Who are they?

40:34.466 --> 40:35.932
Probably hikers.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.734
Do they have any
phones, radios?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.969
I don't know, but who
doesn't have a phone?

40:39.971 --> 40:41.404
Yeah, but there's no way

40:41.406 --> 40:43.172
they're getting any
service out here.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.341
That's why this
spot is perfect for us.

40:45.343 --> 40:46.976
But if you don't silence them,

40:46.978 --> 40:50.013
your perfect spot will
be swarming with feds

40:50.015 --> 40:52.415
Emma, I'm not going to move.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.618
It took me two years to find
this place and get it running.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.621
Do you want to build another
lab or spend the rest of

40:57.623 --> 40:59.057
your life in Lompoc?

41:00.692 --> 41:02.391
We wouldn't be making product.

41:02.393 --> 41:03.627
I know.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.664
So let's see if we can
resolve this first.

41:08.033 --> 41:10.299
Ever see the inside of a cat?

41:10.301 --> 41:11.568
The inside.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.302
You're a friggin
moron, aren't ya?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.571
You're psycho.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.404
I'm not.

41:15.406 --> 41:16.472
Why the hell you...

41:16.474 --> 41:17.308
Shut up.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.144
So last night, tell
me some good news.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.347
We found the camp.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.649
Yes, and?

41:25.651 --> 41:27.050
They weren't there.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.217
Where are they?

41:28.219 --> 41:29.686
I don't know.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.087
The girl?

41:31.089 --> 41:32.023
I buried her.

41:32.958 --> 41:33.792
That won't do.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.293
What, you want
me to dig her up?

41:37.295 --> 41:38.261
You said bury her.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.696
Change of plans.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.066
This is bullshit.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.767
Help him.

41:43.769 --> 41:44.570
Okay.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.438
Not so fast.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.843
Which one of you let the guy go?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.678
What do you mean?

41:54.680 --> 41:57.048
Who was watching the
hostage when he escaped?

41:58.817 --> 42:00.984
Well, he had a friend.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.385
So it was you.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.353
Well yeah, but he had
a friend hiding though.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.328
Get another body bag.

42:20.438 --> 42:23.174
This is Civil
War era medicine.

42:25.010 --> 42:26.144
Hell, Peloponnesian.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.882
What the fuck
you talking about?

42:39.625 --> 42:42.360
Can't be worse than when I
got my Prince Albert, right?

42:45.130 --> 42:45.964
Had your fill?

42:50.902 --> 42:53.104
Get me up, pass me
a stick for my mouth.

43:01.913 --> 43:02.848
And bite.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.517
It's okay, it's okay.

43:08.519 --> 43:09.554
Stick at least.

43:13.959 --> 43:14.791
Okay.

43:14.793 --> 43:15.627
Here we go.

43:25.036 --> 43:25.871
Just a second.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.006
Gonna get the bullet now.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.309
I gotta' dig in
there man, hold on.

43:39.851 --> 43:40.686
Okay.

43:44.622 --> 43:48.124
Okay, a little bit longer.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.594
Here comes the fun part here.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.433
All right, here we go.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.169
Oh, fuck!

44:27.733 --> 44:29.465
Thanks, man.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.701
Hey, you're gonna'
have a hell of a scar,

44:31.703 --> 44:33.138
but the bleeding should stop.

44:36.241 --> 44:37.943
What do we
know of these people?

44:38.877 --> 44:40.176
Two men.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.010
That's it?

44:41.012 --> 44:42.511
That's it.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.181
How did they get here,
by car, chopper, on foot?

44:45.183 --> 44:47.817
I didn't see a
car at the camp.

44:47.819 --> 44:50.820
Well maybe they drove it
away before you arrived.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.055
Drove where?

44:52.057 --> 44:54.724
There's no roads, those
no anything for miles.

44:54.726 --> 44:55.959
We drive in.

44:55.961 --> 44:59.729
On an ATV, on a
path detailed by me.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.064
I chose this place specifically

45:01.066 --> 45:02.899
for its remote location.

45:02.901 --> 45:05.068
It's clearly
not remote enough.

45:05.070 --> 45:09.572
I looked for tire tracks,
nothin', they walked in.

45:09.574 --> 45:11.674
They couldn't have gone far.

45:11.676 --> 45:13.777
Especially if you clipped one.

45:13.779 --> 45:16.412
Yeah, he might
be dead already.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.747
Where were they headed?

45:17.749 --> 45:20.083
Down this river.

45:20.085 --> 45:25.090
So, you have a serious
injury, you're on foot,

45:26.557 --> 45:30.095
you're scared, you're miles
away from any civilization.

45:30.996 --> 45:32.397
Where would you go?

45:37.135 --> 45:38.601
This is your haunt, Seth.

45:38.603 --> 45:40.403
You scouted this terrain.

45:40.405 --> 45:41.873
Where would you go?

45:45.643 --> 45:47.343
Get my rifle.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.760
This is where they went in.

46:36.862 --> 46:39.728
All right, looks
like we're getting wet.

46:39.730 --> 46:40.565
Shit.

46:47.205 --> 46:48.237
We're crossing.

46:48.239 --> 46:49.438
Where?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.673
About a half
mile from the lab.

46:50.675 --> 46:51.941
Good.

46:51.943 --> 46:54.079
Now check out that cabin
and be fucking discreet.

47:01.953 --> 47:02.888
They're in there.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.322
Take the front entrance,
I'll move around the side

47:06.324 --> 47:07.725
in case there's a rear exit.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.086
They're gone.

47:37.088 --> 47:38.054
What do
you mean they're gone?

47:38.056 --> 47:39.555
You just said you saw them.

47:39.557 --> 47:42.225
They must have just left,
their fire is still warm.

47:42.227 --> 47:44.027
Find them.

47:44.029 --> 47:44.862
Fuck.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.399
Couldn't have got far.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.302
Look for tracks.

47:53.004 --> 47:54.305
Which way did they go?

48:13.324 --> 48:14.457
Come on we gotta move.

48:14.459 --> 48:16.359
Don't slow down.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.360
How's your leg?

48:17.362 --> 48:18.594
Fine.

48:18.596 --> 48:19.362
I think
we're in the clear.

48:19.364 --> 48:21.030
Just keep going.

48:21.032 --> 48:22.498
You're falling behind.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.102
You need to work
on your endurance.

48:26.104 --> 48:27.270
I said I'm fine.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.073
What?

48:29.274 --> 48:30.108
What'd you say?

48:30.976 --> 48:31.941
I'm not sure.

48:31.943 --> 48:33.776
You look dazed.

48:33.778 --> 48:35.613
You don't have the
blood to do a sprint.

48:36.814 --> 48:38.016
Just give me a second.

48:40.618 --> 48:42.585
I can walk at least.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.421
Okay.

48:44.289 --> 48:45.488
I don't see them,

48:45.490 --> 48:46.722
but we still have to
find a place to hold up

48:46.724 --> 48:47.556
before the rendezvous.

48:48.393 --> 48:49.325
Come on!

48:56.601 --> 48:57.868
I've lost them.

49:00.471 --> 49:02.105
I got 'em.

49:03.408 --> 49:04.840
They're too far.

49:04.842 --> 49:05.676
Shut up.

49:08.846 --> 49:09.878
Leave it, leave it.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.047
It's got our stuff.

49:11.049 --> 49:12.848
I know
what's in it, come on.

49:12.850 --> 49:16.352
Don't lose them, go.

49:16.354 --> 49:17.422
Keep your radio on.

49:55.993 --> 49:56.925
Let's get the gun.

49:56.927 --> 49:58.194
Leave it, leave it, leave it,

49:58.196 --> 49:59.030
there could be more
following, come on.

50:14.645 --> 50:15.844
Where are we going?

50:15.846 --> 50:17.480
South, I think.

50:17.482 --> 50:18.681
Why?

50:18.683 --> 50:20.749
First, it's away
from the men with guns

50:20.751 --> 50:24.153
and second it's
toward our rendezvous.

50:24.155 --> 50:25.821
Where's the GPS?

50:25.823 --> 50:26.655
It's gone.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.157
Where?

50:28.159 --> 50:29.792
In the river,
in the hut, I don't know.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.094
See, we should have
gone back for the gun.

50:31.096 --> 50:32.828
It wasn't worth the risk.

50:32.830 --> 50:34.297
We're lost, we're soaked,

50:34.299 --> 50:37.633
we've got no food, no
phone, we've got nothing.

50:37.635 --> 50:41.003
Just stick with me for
like 18 more hours, okay?

50:41.005 --> 50:42.205
Nah, I'm going back.

50:42.207 --> 50:43.172
No.

50:43.174 --> 50:44.440
You're not in charge, E.

50:44.442 --> 50:46.175
We just hiked
like three miles.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.377
These assholes have
dictated everything

50:48.379 --> 50:51.414
because they have guns and
we don't, I'm done running.

50:51.416 --> 50:52.615
We gotta' stick together.

50:52.617 --> 50:55.551
Then come with
me, don't argue.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.519
I'm going.

50:56.521 --> 50:57.486
No, you're not going back.

50:57.488 --> 50:58.854
Don't fucking touch me.

50:58.856 --> 51:00.055
We can't split up.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.023
Back the fuck off.

51:01.025 --> 51:02.225
You back the fuck off.

51:13.471 --> 51:14.872
You're such a fucking child.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.774
You always have to get your way.

51:18.776 --> 51:22.411
If I had my way
we'd be in Cabo.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.882
Sure, so you could blow
the rest of your money.

51:26.151 --> 51:27.683
Okay, Dad.

51:27.685 --> 51:30.188
You want to know why we're
here, why the work retreat?

51:31.356 --> 51:34.557
Fisk begged me to talk
some sense into you

51:34.559 --> 51:36.825
because you're destroying
both of our careers.

51:36.827 --> 51:38.327
So you're Fisk's
errand boy now.

51:38.329 --> 51:40.229
I thought you were mine.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.630
I set up this whole weekend

51:41.632 --> 51:44.869
because I was trying to
reconnect with you, but I'm out.

51:47.037 --> 51:48.904
What do you mean out?

51:48.906 --> 51:50.173
I quit.

51:50.175 --> 51:51.374
I'm done.

51:51.376 --> 51:52.577
I'm done with music.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.378
You're the most
talented person I know,

51:55.380 --> 51:57.846
but I can't deal with
you anymore, man.

51:57.848 --> 51:59.482
I thought I was sick
of the music industry,

51:59.484 --> 52:00.951
but it turns out I'm
just sick of you.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.989
Fine, you've been
dead weight for years.

52:19.437 --> 52:21.170
Seth?

52:21.172 --> 52:22.104
What?

52:22.106 --> 52:23.872
What's your status?

52:23.874 --> 52:25.107
No news yet.

52:25.109 --> 52:26.442
Why isn't
Banks responding?

52:26.444 --> 52:28.010
I don't know, he
took off after them.

52:28.012 --> 52:30.012
As he should,
why didn't you follow?

52:30.014 --> 52:31.214
I did.

52:31.216 --> 52:32.381
I am.

52:32.383 --> 52:34.149
Find,
them, deal with this,

52:34.151 --> 52:35.984
or don't come back.

52:35.986 --> 52:39.054
It's my fucking lab,
Emma, I'm in as deep as you.

52:39.056 --> 52:41.690
It is your fucking lab, Seth.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.859
That's why this
whole fucking fuck up

52:43.861 --> 52:46.831
is your fucking
responsibility, you fuck.

52:59.477 --> 53:02.378
Seth, kindly give
me your location.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.214
Why?

53:04.415 --> 53:06.148
Because I'm coming out there.

53:06.150 --> 53:09.184
That's not
necessary, we can handle it.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.489
Well that time has
passed, I'm on my way.

53:16.594 --> 53:18.227
You're staying here.

53:18.229 --> 53:19.928
We know nothing
about these men.

53:19.930 --> 53:21.497
You could be putting
yourself at risk.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.599
I don't trust this misfit crew

53:23.601 --> 53:26.269
to run a garage sale
let alone a manhunt,

53:26.271 --> 53:28.003
so I've gotta go.

53:28.005 --> 53:30.539
You pack up the
remaining product

53:30.541 --> 53:35.513
and in the morning, torch
the place, torch it all.

55:14.244 --> 55:17.348
Come
on, where's you gun?

55:19.584 --> 55:20.418
A phone.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.899
You get the text, right?

56:10.901 --> 56:12.367
Then you gotta' go to the place.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.036
It's a different place
every single time, right?

56:14.038 --> 56:16.171
They're not gonna let
anybody just in right,

56:16.173 --> 56:17.573
so you gotta' show
them the text,

56:17.575 --> 56:19.274
you gotta' knock first
right, three times.

56:19.276 --> 56:20.509
You gotta' have
special glasses.

56:20.511 --> 56:23.045
It's the best sushi
you're ever gonna' have.

56:23.047 --> 56:23.879
Sounds fishy.

56:23.881 --> 56:24.813
Keep em' coming.

56:24.815 --> 56:26.484
Your wish is my command.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.652
Yeah, she's hot.

56:29.654 --> 56:30.819
She's all right.

56:30.821 --> 56:32.921
Man, she likes you.

56:32.923 --> 56:35.524
Yeah, but she likes my
hundred dollar bills more.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.059
Sounds like any woman.

56:38.829 --> 56:40.465
What are you
two talking about?

56:41.632 --> 56:43.599
He just called
you a gold digger.

56:43.601 --> 56:44.433
Man.

56:44.435 --> 56:45.868
What?

56:45.870 --> 56:48.205
Then why do I
always pay, asshole.

56:49.139 --> 56:51.840
You see what you just did?

56:51.842 --> 56:54.011
Just drink up,
man, it's on me.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.279
Hey.

56:57.281 --> 56:59.283
Cheers.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.151
Hey, I see you
started without me.

57:03.153 --> 57:04.252
We started at noon.

57:05.389 --> 57:07.022
Everybody, this is Callie.

57:07.024 --> 57:09.191
Callie, this is everybody.

57:09.193 --> 57:10.025
Hi.

57:10.027 --> 57:10.895
Hi.

57:11.762 --> 57:12.597
We've met.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.966
So martinis all around, huh?

57:17.968 --> 57:19.167
We're celebrating.

57:19.169 --> 57:20.671
What's the special occasion?

57:21.939 --> 57:23.572
Holy shit, you didn't.

57:23.574 --> 57:24.840
He did.

57:24.842 --> 57:25.676
I did.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.613
Well, congratulations,
it's beautiful.

57:30.615 --> 57:32.080
Thank you.

57:32.082 --> 57:34.382
I am going to go
find the lady's room,

57:34.384 --> 57:36.652
so I'll be back, vodka tonic?

57:36.654 --> 57:37.686
Sure.

57:37.688 --> 57:38.523
Thanks.

57:40.591 --> 57:44.993
I guess I've been out
of the loop for a while.

57:44.995 --> 57:46.228
We just tell people in person,

57:46.230 --> 57:48.063
we don't post or do any
weird shit like that.

57:48.065 --> 57:48.897
Hey.

57:48.899 --> 57:50.332
Hey.

57:50.334 --> 57:52.000
So you and Callie
know each other?

57:52.002 --> 57:53.235
Yeah.

57:53.237 --> 57:54.803
That's weird, she
didn't mention anything.

57:54.805 --> 57:57.172
I'm not surprised.

57:57.174 --> 57:58.273
Why?

57:58.275 --> 57:59.810
It was kind of a one nighter.

58:02.179 --> 58:05.681
Sorry man, figured you'd want
to hear it from me first.

58:05.683 --> 58:07.084
Yeah, yeah I get it.

58:08.619 --> 58:11.455
So you guys like serious?

58:12.356 --> 58:13.691
I don't know, it's early.

58:14.559 --> 58:15.524
She's hot.

58:15.526 --> 58:16.692
Yeah.

58:16.694 --> 58:19.094
And a fucking
rockstar in the sack.

58:19.096 --> 58:20.397
But you know that already.

58:23.167 --> 58:23.968
Wait.

58:25.302 --> 58:26.569
You haven't hit that yet?

58:26.571 --> 58:28.170
Like I said, it's early.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.006
Jesus, dude.

58:30.374 --> 58:33.275
You know, if I were you,

58:33.277 --> 58:34.311
keep an eye on it.

58:35.746 --> 58:37.848
A girl like that would tap
a stranger in the bathroom.

58:39.283 --> 58:41.349
Hey, where is she anyway?

58:41.351 --> 58:42.685
Shut up, man.

58:42.687 --> 58:44.753
I'm just giving you shit.

58:44.755 --> 58:45.856
You're in for a treat.

58:47.157 --> 58:48.292
What can I get you?

58:49.193 --> 58:51.528
Two vodka tonics.

59:53.958 --> 59:56.226
Fuck, I can't see.

01:00:42.707 --> 01:00:43.908
Oh, sorry.

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:51.013
I didn't think you were
going to be here today.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:53.148
Session got canceled.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.951
Dom?

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:55.720
Of course.

01:00:57.554 --> 01:01:01.325
I don't know why you
put up with that guy.

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:03.393
Yeah.

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:06.496
Were you sleeping?

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.232
Nope.

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:15.003
Good, I, um, just
came to get the rest

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.442
of these things, then
I'll be out of your hair.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.344
Take your time.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.731
I know that this has been
really hard for us, for you,

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:47.204
but I just wanted to say thanks
for being an adult about it.

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:07.990
Bye.

01:02:07.992 --> 01:02:10.560
I think that's everything.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:14.629
I left my address on the
notepad in the kitchen,

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:19.636
so if you find anything you
can always send it there.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.107
Or you can just
come pick it up.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:27.077
Yeah.

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:29.914
Goodbye, Eddie.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:48.931
What?

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:51.800
Wake up, where are they?

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:53.003
Back there.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.304
So they're still alive?

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:57.639
Yes.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:58.807
What about Banks?

01:02:58.809 --> 01:02:59.641
I don't know.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:01.076
He's dead?

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:02.477
Or ran away.

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:07.582
So two dumb ass hikers
took down your top henchmen?

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.683
Maybe.

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:10.252
Do they have a gun?

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:11.686
I don't think so.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:12.556
They might now.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:15.523
Fuck.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.526
And you're napping.

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:21.463
You realize they could have
killed you in your sleep.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.465
You were easy enough
to track down.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.400
You're underestimating them.

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:27.469
I've been out here all
night, where have you been?

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.244
Oh, what?

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.246
You gonna hit me?

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.349
Would you hit my father?

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.251
No.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:44.953
But you'll hit a girl.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:46.188
You're no girl.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.024
Oh, I'm not?

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:48.758
What am I?

01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:51.759
Huh.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:56.100
You're, you're my boss.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:00.302
Goddamn right, I'm your boss.

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:04.909
I will hit you and insult
whenever I goddamn like.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.111
No, no.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:12.881
Let me spell
something out for you

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:15.083
and I'll speak slowly
because you're still groggy

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:15.886
from waking up.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:19.489
I run 14 operations.

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.826
Do you know what that
makes this place?

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.528
One out of fucking 14.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.331
If we're so unimportant,
then why are you here?

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:32.134
Because these
hikers may expose us

01:04:32.136 --> 01:04:35.239
and a lady doesn't
like to be exposed.

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:37.807
Now lead the fucking way.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.279
Where are they going?

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.414
This was their general
direction, south.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.351
We need more than
that, get your map.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.421
There's not much around here,

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.224
they're trapped,
surrounded by wilderness.

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:30.694
They had to arrive somehow.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:32.827
Their exit plan is probably

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:34.196
by the same route they arrived.

01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:36.698
There was no ATV or
jeep at their camp.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.532
Any tracks?

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:38.366
No tire tracks,

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:39.601
Banks assured me.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.205
There's no way they walked here.

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:45.573
They had to fly in.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.109
That's the only option.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:50.114
So you're a client
flying in wealthy clients.

01:05:51.215 --> 01:05:52.316
Where's your drop off?

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:56.784
There are several clearings
within their walk radius.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.654
Speculate.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:15.903
Fuck.

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:19.074
Put the
binoculars away.

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:20.175
Get out your rifle.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.743
I can't line up a shot.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.411
You're just wasting bullets.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:28.316
So put it away!

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.654
Forget it, we'll follow him.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.099
So he did have a gun.

01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:18.066
Where are you going?

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.101
He's gone.

01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:20.468
We can't be sure.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.803
Even if he survived the fall,

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:23.171
there's no way of tracking him.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.639
You should follow him.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:25.707
Over the cliff?

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:26.974
Maybe you should.

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.310
I gave you a fucking order.

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:29.846
And I fucking say no.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:33.415
Are we gonna do this
little dance again?

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:35.517
Talk all you want,
threaten all you want,

01:07:35.519 --> 01:07:39.020
but you need me and
you need the lab.

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:41.889
Do you know how
much I need your lab?

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.192
Your baby, it's gone.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:47.997
Before I left to find you I
gave the order to burn it down.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:53.337
You're right.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.507
We're compromised and we
have a witness at large.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:01.042
We need to find his exit route,

01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:03.413
but I can guarantee you it
wasn't over that goddamn cliff.

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:18.728
Dom?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.898
Dom, where are you?

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:03.207
Dominik?

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:07.042
Dominik!

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:24.459
Put him in your sights.

01:09:24.461 --> 01:09:25.926
But it's too fucking bumpy.

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:27.261
Why do you
whine like a little girl,

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.029
take him down.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:30.965
Is he down?

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.767
No.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.538
God, you're so
fucking useless.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.534
Stop!

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:44.806
You put up a good
fight, now it's over.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.279
Not so useless now, bitch.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.321
Drop it.

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:02.359
Drop it, I'm not
gonna say it again.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:07.897
Hi there.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.816
Hey, hey.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.218
Where's your ride?

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:04.519
What ride?

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:07.223
How are you
planning on leaving/

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.792
We were gonna stay a month.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.496
Bullshit, who's
coming to get you

01:12:14.498 --> 01:12:16.931
and why'd you split
from your friend?

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.133
He wanted to go find a gun.

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:20.668
From Banks?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.903
I don't know.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.206
Don't know what?

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.441
Who's Banks?

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:27.675
The marginally
effective gorilla

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.344
chasing you earlier,
you remember him now?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.115
I hit him with a rock.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:33.883
Where?

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.254
At the river, he
probably drowned.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:42.626
Shit.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:51.300
You're coming with me.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.871
Come on.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.049
Come on, come on.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:13.823
Now, I am gonna have a
chat with your pilot.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:20.797
Stay here, or the pilot dies.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.769
In case you get any
second thoughts.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.708
I feel much better now.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:41.851
Hi.

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:46.454
Hi, can I help you?

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:48.958
I hope so, I need
some help over here.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.659
Yeah, what sort of help?

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.830
I can't explain,
just come with me.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.531
Where's Eddie?

01:13:56.533 --> 01:13:57.532
Eddie?

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.066
I can't say.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:00.704
I got a real problem over
here, there's not much time.

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:03.404
Yeah, who are you?

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:04.240
Stop.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:09.276
Uh-huh.

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:14.616
♪ Turn around

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:15.652
Now walk towards me.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:17.887
Slowly.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.588
I don't have a weapon.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.692
Great, shut up.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.460
You have any idea what
I've been through today?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.599
The shit I've been through
because of you and your friends?

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:32.602
Damn it.

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:39.275
Down.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.315
Ta, ta, ta, ta, wooo.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:48.685
Okay.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:53.890
What the hell is
going on around here?

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:57.559
Where's Dominik and Lora?

01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:59.861
Dominik, is that his name?

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.497
He's dead and Lora too.

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.473
You too, asshole.

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:13.910
You fucked up my operation.

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.544
Who else knows
about this location?

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:17.378
How'd he die?

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.245
Shut up.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.014
Who else knows?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.384
What do you mean?

01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:24.351
Why'd you come here?

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.319
I own this land.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.220
Oh, do you?

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:27.488
Since when?

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.422
About a year ago.

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:32.326
Look, I run a solo operation.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:33.828
All right.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.832
I can guarantee that no one
knows anything about this.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.701
You want to keep your privacy,

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:42.103
I can respect that,
just let us go.

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:46.608
Just take my GPS,
destroy it, burn it,

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:49.543
shove it up a moose's ass,
I don't care, all right?

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:54.281
I'm sure we can come to
some kind of arrangement.

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:55.750
I bet we can.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:00.722
Hey knob
jockey, I'm talking to you.

01:16:00.724 --> 01:16:03.057
Do you have a problem
with me, Vinnie?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.594
Can I help you with something?

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:08.930
How do you get
in the VIP room?

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:12.399
On your mates coat
tails, am a I right?

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.869
It must be a right view
from your position,

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:16.871
staring right up
your boss's Jackson.

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:18.372
Hey, man.

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:21.010
Hey, twat, I'm not finished.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:23.813
You were finished in '94.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:26.948
Cheeky...

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:30.217
Hey.

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.656
He's not my assistant,
he's my partner.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.826
You'd know that if you
were still in the game.

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.394
Well you
can both fuck off then.

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:42.098
You're washed up,
the two of yous.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.270
Sorry, man.

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.373
Say some stupid shit sometimes.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.075
I know.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:54.811
You know I love you, right?

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.350
Here's your phone.

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.755
See you tomorrow.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.256
Where you going?

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:10.093
I know a girl.

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:17.433
Your turn.

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.339
Fuck!

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:28.845
Whoo!

01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:33.280
Fuck you.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.117
Can't win.

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:45.927
That tickle?

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:01.308
Fucking Jesus.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:05.412
Med kit, med kit, the chopper,

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.416
radio, med kit.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:49.358
Get gauze.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:51.427
Leg.

01:18:57.533 --> 01:18:59.268
More for my shoulder.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.204
Anything to stop that blood.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:05.539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:14.818 --> 01:19:15.819
Thank you.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:20.790
I shouldn't have left
you and went for the gun.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:25.428
No, no rush, just,

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:28.264
just chill for a second.

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:36.072
I found your falls.

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:41.508
How'd it look?

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:46.082
Fucking huge,
you'll be impressed.

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:55.058
You meant that about
about you and me, huh?

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:10.940
What the fuck am
I going to do now?

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.745
We'll figure it out.

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:19.815
Just get us out of here.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:22.585
Okay.
