- Have you talked
to Detective Murdoch?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.514
- Both Murdoch and McWorthy

00:49.583 --> 00:51.349
think that arresting John
makes sense.

00:51.352 --> 00:54.219
Apparently there's evidence.
- Oof! Evidence, my eye.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.088
Our son hasn't done
anything wrong!

00:56.156 --> 00:58.123
- I know that, Margaret.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.459
- I don't want you
to set foot in this hospital

01:00.527 --> 01:02.461
until you've cleared
our son's name.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.332
(knocking)
(door opening)

01:09.637 --> 01:11.603
- Constable, as his doctor,
I must ask

01:11.671 --> 01:14.239
that you wait outside.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.314
- Thank you, Dr. Ogden.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.316
- Let's see how you're healing.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.487
- I still can't feel my legs.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.193
- Can you move your toes for me?

01:39.399 --> 01:41.166
(sighing)

01:44.538 --> 01:47.239
John, it's possible
that there's still swelling

01:47.307 --> 01:50.509
near the spine
which will abate in time.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.478
But we have to consider...

01:52.546 --> 01:55.881
the possibility--
- Am I interrupting?

01:58.218 --> 02:00.119
- We'll talk soon, all right?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.592
- I'm sorry
I couldn't come sooner.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.896
How are you?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.032
- They think I killed
Lucille Palmer.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.735
- John, I...

02:16.803 --> 02:19.371
I'm sorry.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.107
- Do you remember
what you told me before?

02:22.109 --> 02:23.975
"Saying sorry doesn't
change anything,

02:23.978 --> 02:26.244
so why waste energy
in saying it"?

02:26.313 --> 02:29.381
- It sounds callous.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.216
- It's true.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.719
- Well, I mixed you up in this.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.987
And it's my fault.
- No. It's...

02:35.990 --> 02:38.323
Look, I knew Sutton was
dangerous and I kept

02:38.392 --> 02:40.259
that from you.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.594
And now they think
I'm a murderer.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.596
And I'm not.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.666
(ominous music)

02:47.734 --> 02:50.835
- Toronto's new Chief Coroner.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.838
You must have friends
in high places.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.607
- I resent your implication.
Mr. Richards.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.609
I've earned this position.
- I'm sure.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.513
- Congratulations, Miss Hart.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.482
- Thank you, Inspector.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.117
- What did you want
to talk to me about?

03:06.186 --> 03:09.354
- John doesn't remember
shooting Mr. Sutton.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.457
Also, John stated
that he heard footsteps

03:12.525 --> 03:14.893
when he entered the room.
Mr. Sutton wasn't

03:14.895 --> 03:17.462
wearing any shoes.
And he was found seated

03:17.530 --> 03:20.498
holding the gun.
- Was someone else there?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.301
- Perhaps. I've asked Miss Hart

03:22.369 --> 03:25.170
to test Mr. Sutton's hands
for any gun powder residue.

03:25.239 --> 03:29.174
- Just as the Detective
suspected, I found no trace.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.643
- Sir, the man who shot John is
still at large.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.645
And I intend to find him.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.315
(rising music)

03:42.656 --> 03:44.656
- John went into that building

03:44.658 --> 03:46.658
to investigate
Lucille Palmer's murder.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.194
Perhaps whoever shot him did so
to keep the truth

03:49.196 --> 03:51.062
from coming out.
- Sir, could that have been

03:51.065 --> 03:54.166
Arthur Carmichael? I mean,
he pointed the finger at John.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.969
- Bring him in, George.
- Sir.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.206
- Your office is so dreary.
- I didn't ask you here

04:01.208 --> 04:03.341
for decorating advice,
Mr. Carmichael.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.510
Have a seat.
- No, you asked me here

04:05.579 --> 04:08.280
to blame me for something
your boss's son did.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.551
- How well do you know
Grant Sutton?

04:12.619 --> 04:15.553
- I knew he was a damn fool.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.555
Violent, too.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.692
- We believe someone else may
have been involved the night

04:20.694 --> 04:22.694
that my constable was shot.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.696
Where were you?
- I was at home.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.665
- Can anyone confirm this?

04:26.733 --> 04:28.833
- That might be tricky.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.769
I was giving a party that night.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.338
Only about 80 of my dearest
friends and colleagues

04:33.406 --> 04:35.707
can attest to my whereabouts.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.743
(soft music)

04:44.651 --> 04:46.751
- Constable Crabtree.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.720
You'll be pleased to know
you can have your desk back.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.189
I've concluded my research.
- Oh.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.058
- About your book...

04:53.060 --> 04:55.927
- What? The one you read
without my permission?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.962
- Yes. Allow me
to apologize again.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.131
I didn't mean any offence. I...

05:00.134 --> 05:02.334
I glanced at it,
and then couldn't stop reading.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.269
- Oh, really?

05:04.271 --> 05:06.271
So you quite liked it.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.007
- Oh, I just tore through it.
The first three chapters were

05:09.076 --> 05:11.076
moving, honest, gripping.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.545
But then...
it rather falls apart

05:13.547 --> 05:15.880
when the little men
from Venus arrive.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.749
I mean, really they just chase

05:17.818 --> 05:19.685
the main character around,
and it becomes silly.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.221
- Silly? Well, thank you,
Miss Newsome.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.390
Considering I never asked
you to read,

05:25.458 --> 05:27.759
let alone critique, my work.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.461
- I was only trying to help.
- Yes, well,

05:29.529 --> 05:32.664
maybe next time, you can keep
your help to yourself.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.904
- Arthur Carmichael has an alibi

05:39.907 --> 05:42.006
for the shooting
of Grant Sutton.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.942
But we don't yet know
his whereabouts

05:44.010 --> 05:46.978
for the shooting
of Lucille Palmer.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.647
- So, you have no idea
where he was for...

05:49.716 --> 05:53.318
four days?
- So it would seem.

05:53.386 --> 05:56.187
At any rate, he's our most
compelling suspect.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.723
- Right. Well, we know it wasn't

05:58.726 --> 06:00.759
Grant Sutton. I mean,
if it wasn't Carmichael,

06:00.827 --> 06:02.661
who else is there?

06:02.729 --> 06:04.863
- I hate to level

06:04.931 --> 06:07.532
such an accusation, but...

06:07.600 --> 06:09.667
Inspector McWorthy may
have been involved

06:09.670 --> 06:11.536
in covering-up the murder.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.605
- You don't think
he did it himself?

06:13.607 --> 06:16.541
- I don't know. But if he was
involved in covering up

06:16.609 --> 06:18.510
one murder, he may
have been involved

06:18.578 --> 06:20.345
in covering up more.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.950
- Who did Lucille
address the letter to?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.487
- It doesn't say.
She wrote that she was

06:28.555 --> 06:30.956
carrying a child and wants
the father to marry her.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.024
- I swear, she never told
me any of this.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.693
- Are you sure?
- She was just trying

06:35.696 --> 06:38.163
to trap you.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.031
- Isabel...

06:40.099 --> 06:42.667
- I'm sorry I got so angry.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.502
I forgive you.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.772
- I've never seen that letter.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.807
It couldn't have
been meant for me.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.210
- The piece of bullet they
found in Miss Palmer
came from your gun.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.246
- That's impossible.
I didn't kill her.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.181
I wasn't even there
when Lucille was shot.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.783
- And no one else knew that you
had been carrying a gun around,

06:58.786 --> 07:02.621
did they John?
- No.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.293
- You finally agreed

07:08.361 --> 07:10.796
to have a drink with me.
- I felt like celebrating.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.570
- So all it took was
you getting a raise.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.406
- Well, a drink
for this promotion, and...

07:21.475 --> 07:24.075
just think what we'll do
the next time I get promoted.

07:24.143 --> 07:27.212
- But you're coroner now.
What's higher than that?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.848
- I'm sure I'll
think of something.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.817
- Will you be having a drink

07:32.886 --> 07:34.686
with any of
the other inspectors?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.988
- No.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.158
Just you.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.460
(suspenseful music)

07:42.529 --> 07:45.597
- What an awful place to die.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.432
- Indeed.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.370
- How did John Brackenreid
ever fall in with such company?

07:54.374 --> 07:57.275
- Let's focus on the bullet's
trajectory, George.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.045
The bullet that killed
Lucille Palmer travelled

08:00.113 --> 08:03.114
straight through her heart
and exited

08:03.182 --> 08:05.517
just left
of her ninth vertebrae.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.319
Where was the body found?

08:07.387 --> 08:10.188
- On the floor next to the bed.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.190
- And the bullet?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.559
- In the mattress.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.469
I suppose she was
lying there in the bed,

08:24.538 --> 08:28.339
was shot, tried to crawl away
and ended up on the floor.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.675
- I don't think so.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.545
- Sir, the lads from Station
House One said they found

08:33.613 --> 08:35.547
the bullet in the mattress
right here.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.415
- Well, that may be George,

08:37.483 --> 08:39.484
but that's not the bullet
that killed her.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.554
That bullet exited her body.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.627
Do you see any blood here?

08:49.630 --> 08:53.298
Someone shot Lucille Palmer,
then shot the mattress.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.767
- Planting a bullet
from John's gun.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.969
- Whoever it was would have
had to have gotten John's gun,

08:57.971 --> 09:00.305
shot the mattress, then taken
a shard of the bullet

09:00.373 --> 09:02.507
and placed it inside
Miss Palmer's body.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.842
- Was John's gun placed

09:04.911 --> 09:06.678
in the evidence lock-up
at Station House One?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.513
- Yes, after he was shot.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.649
I'm having George look
at their evidence log book.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.086
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
May I have a moment?

09:15.154 --> 09:17.188
- We're busy I'm afraid,
Miss Hart.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.457
- I'm sorry. This may
be important. A few days ago,

09:19.525 --> 09:21.526
I noticed that the spare key
for the cold storage room

09:21.595 --> 09:23.595
was missing.
- When exactly did you

09:23.663 --> 09:25.663
notice this?
- Monday, I believe.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.533
- Whoever stole
that key could've

09:28.602 --> 09:30.635
planted the bullet shard
in Miss Palmer.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.605
- They would've had to have
taken John's gun out
of evidence first.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.640
- Inspector McWorthy.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.875
It was him, Murdoch.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.711
He shot my son

09:39.779 --> 09:41.846
and then framed him for murder.
- Yes, sir.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.182
And if that's the case,
he'll spend the rest of his days

09:44.250 --> 09:47.052
behind bars.
Thank you Miss Hart.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.527
(dramatic music)

10:01.301 --> 10:04.402
(sonorous vibration)

10:06.707 --> 10:09.708
(rising music)

10:27.527 --> 10:29.360
- He was like this
when I found him.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.463
- Fortunate for you.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.832
Still, very odd.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.603
He died from a blow
to the back of the head.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.571
Likely with this.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.208
I'll have to examine it
for fingermarks.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.477
- Who would want him dead?

10:45.545 --> 10:48.079
Present company excluded,
of course.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.650
Oh, and I found this
in his jacket pocket.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.022
- Let's see if it's
familiar to Miss Hart.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.962
(sombre music)

11:06.265 --> 11:08.433
Is this the key to your
cold storage room, Miss Hart?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.502
- Yes, where did you find it?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.837
- Inspector McWorthy's pocket.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.906
- He stole it?

11:14.974 --> 11:17.575
- He must have. In which case,
he could have planted

11:17.644 --> 11:19.844
the bullet fragment
in Lucille Palmer's body.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.080
- Do you really think
he would frame

11:22.148 --> 11:24.749
Constable Brackenreid
for her murder?
- It's possible.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.452
He was hit
in the back of the head

11:27.520 --> 11:29.320
with a large paperweight.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.122
I believe you'll conclude
that the cause of death

11:31.191 --> 11:32.990
was blunt force trauma.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.427
- Of course. I'll get to work.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.732
(door closing)

11:40.800 --> 11:43.534
- Where do you think
it will land?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.837
- I have no idea.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.673
- I've dropped this marble from
the same position every time.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.409
Each time, the outcome
is different. It shouldn't be.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.412
(marble clattering)

11:54.481 --> 11:56.414
Do you want a drink?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.750
- Yes, please.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.018
- One for the lady.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.521
So, are we to blame
for the results of our actions

12:03.589 --> 12:05.723
if the outcome is
not predictable?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.692
- Of course we are.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.962
- Or do we just feel
we should take responsibility

12:11.030 --> 12:14.365
even though we have no control?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.568
- We have control.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.937
John Brackenreid is
lying in a bed

12:20.006 --> 12:22.006
in the hospital

12:22.074 --> 12:25.109
facing the possibility
he may never walk again

12:25.178 --> 12:27.445
because I refused to wait

12:27.514 --> 12:29.247
for a more experienced surgeon.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.316
- And my actions put

12:31.384 --> 12:33.251
you into the position you're in.

12:33.319 --> 12:36.687
Or did they?
Perhaps the way things turn out

12:36.756 --> 12:38.790
is beyond our control.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.759
(marble clattering)
- I don't believe that.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.928
- Look at that.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.830
100 points.
(chuckling)

12:50.703 --> 12:52.703
- Is that the paperweight
that killed McWorthy?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.940
- I believe so. I've obtained
some fingermarks from it.

12:56.008 --> 12:58.276
I'd like to compare them
to Arthur Carmichael's.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.211
- Sir, weren't they friends?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.647
- I don't know if I'd go
so far as to call them friends.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.615
I believe McWorthy may

13:04.618 --> 13:06.818
have been
in Arthur Carmichael's pocket.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.921
Perhaps he drew the line
at murder.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.823
Have you found anything?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.491
- Well, sir, I went down
to Station House One to have

13:13.560 --> 13:16.227
a look at the logbook.
It's not there.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.429
It's been subpoenaed
by the Crown Attorney's office.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.534
- The Board hasn't met as of yet
to decide on your position.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.171
- With all due respect, sir,
that isn't why I'm here.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.273
I need access
to the Station House One's

13:29.342 --> 13:31.242
evidence room log book.
I believe--

13:31.311 --> 13:33.110
- I wish I could
help you, Detective.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.648
But that log book is being held
as evidence in another case.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.716
- Sir, it's very important

13:38.785 --> 13:40.919
that I see that book.
- I'm sorry.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.954
(tense music)

13:46.959 --> 13:48.726
- Do you think
he's telling the truth, sir?

13:48.794 --> 13:50.661
- Well, I'd certainly like
to think so.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.431
- I might have a way
of finding out.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.133
It wouldn't be entirely legal...

13:56.202 --> 13:58.703
- Then perhaps it's best
you don't tell me.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.307
- Detective.
- Miss Newsome.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.544
- Constable. I see they've

14:06.546 --> 14:08.412
let you out of the station.
- Miss Newsome.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.415
Actually, I came by,
I wanted to apologize.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.117
I truly regret my harsh words.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.987
You were trying to give me
some constructive criticism

14:16.055 --> 14:17.822
on my book, and I...

14:17.890 --> 14:19.657
well, I took it poorly,
to say the least.

14:19.725 --> 14:23.494
- And I shouldn't have
taken your manuscript.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.363
Care to join me?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.398
- I haven't the time. In fact,

14:27.466 --> 14:29.367
I have a favour to ask you.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.269
Regarding the Crown
Attorney's office.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.504
- That's why you apologized?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.306
- No, I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't very important.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.042
Now, Detective Murdoch needs
to see a page

14:38.110 --> 14:40.244
from the log book
from Station House One,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.046
and you're
the only person I know

14:42.115 --> 14:44.782
who could get that.
- Detective Murdoch involved

14:44.851 --> 14:47.218
in subterfuge?
- Only very mildly.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.053
- Isn't he up
for the inspector position?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.355
- He is, which is why we need
to be very discreet about this.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.192
- Why is this book so important?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.527
- Well, that's a long story...

14:56.596 --> 14:58.562
- Then you can help me

14:58.631 --> 15:00.865
finish this sandwich
while you convince me.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.535
- What kind of sandwich is it?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.341
- He was always
such an athletic boy.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.077
Always first in every race.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.213
- Margaret, you must
stop talking like this.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.082
- I suppose we'll have to get
him his own wheelchair now.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.452
If they allow one in prison.
- Mother, stop!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.220
I won't go to prison!

15:23.289 --> 15:25.356
- Then why is there a guard
outside your door?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.758
And why isn't your father
out clearing your name?

15:27.827 --> 15:29.727
- He will. Won't you, Father?

15:29.796 --> 15:33.097
- Yes, of course. And you are
going to fully recover.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.133
- Oh!
- Margaret, come here.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.838
- I am just being realistic.
- So am I.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.341
- That lovely girl

15:43.409 --> 15:45.776
might not want to wait
for John to walk again,

15:45.779 --> 15:48.446
and be exonerated for murder.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.582
Oh! His life will be over
before it's begun.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.985
- My legs...

15:53.987 --> 15:56.955
The numbness is getting worse.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.633
- I've transcribed the entries
from the log book

16:09.702 --> 16:11.135
for the day in question.
- Can I see it?

16:11.203 --> 16:13.938
Thank you very much,
Miss Newsome.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.808
- And that's not all.
I've managed to find files

16:16.876 --> 16:19.510
on Arthur Carmichael. He was
arrested for a variety

16:19.578 --> 16:21.813
of crimes, but the Crown
never brought them to trial.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.848
- What sort of crimes?
- Vandalism,

16:23.916 --> 16:26.184
public intoxication,
assault and battery...

16:28.954 --> 16:31.889
- Thank you. I have
to show these to the detective.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.691
Sir!

16:33.760 --> 16:36.160
- I've gotten two sets
of fingermarks from this.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.295
One presumably is
Inspector McWorthy's.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.664
The other could be
Arthur Carmichael.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.900
- Right. You'll want
to have a look at these.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.973
- Only one person signed
into the evidence room

16:48.975 --> 16:51.442
shortly after John's gun
was checked in.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.445
A... Constable Bauder.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.315
McWorthy could have sent him.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.384
- Sir, look at these...

16:59.452 --> 17:01.719
files on Arthur Carmichael.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.521
It seems every case
built against him

17:03.589 --> 17:05.723
was eventually dropped. And sir,

17:05.791 --> 17:08.693
they all went through
the same Crown Prosecutor.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.731
- (Murdoch):<i> Allen Templeton...</i>

17:13.800 --> 17:15.699
- Where did you get these?

17:15.768 --> 17:19.070
- Sir, these files show
an escalation of violence

17:19.138 --> 17:21.138
in Arthur Carmichael's actions.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.741
And what's more,
he kept getting away with it.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.944
- Not only are you accusing
my office of malfeasance,

17:26.946 --> 17:30.181
you had files purloined.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.150
Leave it alone, Detective.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.220
- I can't just walk away
from this, and you know that.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.255
- There are interests
at play here

17:38.324 --> 17:40.558
bigger than either
of us, Detective.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.626
I'll tell you this only once:

17:42.629 --> 17:45.296
stop this investigation.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.432
- Or what?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.134
- Or not only will you lose

17:50.202 --> 17:52.236
any chance at promotion
to Inspector,

17:52.305 --> 17:54.872
you'll lose
your current position.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.808
As will anyone else
who is helping you.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.646
(rising music)

18:07.953 --> 18:10.254
Get out of here.
Come on, get out of here.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.256
HEY!

18:12.325 --> 18:14.792
I SAID GET OUT OF HERE! GO!

18:17.329 --> 18:19.230
- Constable Bauder.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.733
Detective Murdoch.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.635
- What do you want?
- You signed

18:24.637 --> 18:26.971
into the evidence locker
at Station House Number One

18:27.039 --> 18:29.940
on the night that Sutton
and Constable Brackenreid

18:30.009 --> 18:31.943
were shot.
- So?

18:32.011 --> 18:34.412
- So, that night, a gun was
stolen and used to shoot

18:34.480 --> 18:37.815
a bullet into a mattress.
- How does this concern me?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.917
- That bullet is being used
to frame an innocent man.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.920
- I had nothing to do with that.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.955
- You're the only one
who accessed the evidence locker

18:45.024 --> 18:47.625
that night.
- Did you deliberately take

18:47.693 --> 18:50.060
that gun to falsely
plant evidence?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.796
- Talk to us, Bauder,

18:52.865 --> 18:54.699
or so help me God,
we will pitch your body

18:54.767 --> 18:57.068
off this bridge!

18:59.672 --> 19:01.572
- Tell us the truth,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.908
or we will have your badge.
- All right.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.944
All right, it was me.
- Who put you up to it?

19:07.012 --> 19:10.181
Inspector McWorthy?
- No... no, it wasn't McWorthy.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.483
- Well, then who?
- I don't know.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.519
He found me while I was
on my rounds that night.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.454
An older gentleman,
well-dressed.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.622
He gave me precise instructions.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.292
Get the gun,
shoot the mattress...

19:21.360 --> 19:24.428
He paid me $50.
How could I turn that down?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.797
I have a family. A constable's
salary isn't enough

19:26.866 --> 19:29.267
to feed four children.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.302
- So, all you did was shoot
the bullet in the mattress?

19:31.304 --> 19:33.604
McWorthy was to take care
of the rest.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.940
- No, that's just it.
The last thing the man said was,

19:35.942 --> 19:37.942
"McWorthy can't know
a thing about this".

19:40.512 --> 19:42.680
- Carry on, Constable.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.652
This could mean
someone else was protecting

19:48.721 --> 19:51.722
Arthur Carmichael.
Allen Templeton hinted

19:51.790 --> 19:54.091
at someone more powerful
than him.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.993
I'd be willing
to wager that that someone

19:56.061 --> 19:57.995
is Arthur Carmichael's father.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.932
The Chief Crown Attorney.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.334
What a mess.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.442
(groaning)
- Higgins!

20:11.510 --> 20:13.511
- Oh, George.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.247
- Henry! Are you all right?
- I don't... know, sir.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.482
I... I was alone and some men...

20:18.550 --> 20:21.519
I barely saw them, sir.
Two of them rushed me

20:21.587 --> 20:24.121
and two ran into your office.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.557
- Are you all right?
- Ah, yes. Go. Go.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.995
- No! It's gone!

20:31.063 --> 20:32.863
- What were they after?

20:32.865 --> 20:36.000
- The paperweight
that killed McWorthy!

20:36.068 --> 20:38.035
(soft music)

20:43.309 --> 20:45.075
- I'm sorry, Detective,

20:45.144 --> 20:47.278
I am confused
as to your intention.

20:47.346 --> 20:50.447
Are you here to accuse me
of something?

20:50.516 --> 20:53.150
- You covered up
your son's petty crimes.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.085
- So you claim.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.656
- You wanted to protect
your son. I understand that.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.524
But we are
now looking at murder.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.661
Three murders,
and a police constable

21:03.729 --> 21:05.896
who may never fully recover
from being shot.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.499
- None of this has
anything to do with me.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.934
- There is a conspiracy

21:11.003 --> 21:12.770
to protect your son.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.105
We believe
Inspector McWorthy was involved.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.908
And others.
- Others?

21:17.910 --> 21:21.278
- Someone with enough power
and influence

21:21.347 --> 21:23.480
to force
Inspector McWorthy's hand.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.916
And, when Mr. McWorthy got
in the way,

21:25.984 --> 21:27.985
have him killed.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.321
- And all of these people
are meant

21:30.323 --> 21:32.589
to be protecting... Arthur?

21:32.658 --> 21:34.591
I hardly think him

21:34.594 --> 21:36.460
capable of murder.
- I do.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.163
And if so, he will go to prison,

21:39.231 --> 21:42.132
as will everyone else
who has been protecting him.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.935
- Well, this is all
very interesting, Detective.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.138
I hope you find
the people you're looking for.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.140
- Inspector McWorthy's
killer left

21:49.208 --> 21:51.475
the murder weapon
at the scene of the crime.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.944
Some hired men ransacked

21:54.013 --> 21:56.647
my Station House and stole it.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.749
- That sounds like
an impediment.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.552
- Well, not particularly
in this case.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.854
You see, I was able

22:03.922 --> 22:06.490
to document fingermarks from it.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.693
You wanted to protect your son.

22:09.762 --> 22:13.397
But when I catch whoever killed
Inspector McWorthy,

22:13.465 --> 22:16.500
he will be faced with a choice:

22:16.502 --> 22:19.637
turn in all those
who helped him,

22:19.705 --> 22:21.038
or hang.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.843
How far do you think he'll be
willing to go to protect you?

22:25.911 --> 22:27.712
(suspenseful music)

22:40.393 --> 22:42.259
(sighing)

22:46.465 --> 22:48.732
- No... nothing.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.834
- Are you sure?
- I could feel it

22:50.903 --> 22:54.204
yesterday, but...
- It's getting worse, isn't it?

22:54.273 --> 22:56.039
(sighing)

22:56.108 --> 22:58.308
- Doctor Ogden,
what's happening?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.677
- I don't know.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.747
Yet.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.849
Excuse me.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.089
(sentimental music)

23:12.157 --> 23:14.858
(crying)

23:14.927 --> 23:17.828
- Has he gotten worse?

23:17.896 --> 23:19.964
- Who?

23:20.032 --> 23:22.333
- You only have
one patient, Doctor.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.104
- He's losing sensation
above the waist.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.707
It moves higher every day.
- Fantastic.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.910
- What?
- Think.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.978
Acute damage to the spinal cord
would be static.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.114
If the paralysis is progressing,

23:37.183 --> 23:39.316
the damage may not be permanent.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.519
- Pressure? What could be
causing that?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.156
- I've read about this. Blood
trapped in the spinal column

23:45.224 --> 23:46.991
is forced upwards
as the pressure increases.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.026
- And that could cause
the paralysis?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.795
- Yes, but drainage could
make it reversible.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.797
- He'll need another surgery?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.933
- Yes, right away.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.003
- I... I can't do it.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.572
- Why not?
- I...

24:01.640 --> 24:04.275
Even the thought of performing
another surgery, I...

24:04.343 --> 24:06.209
I simply can't.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.149
- I'll do it.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.821
(sighing heavily)

24:17.824 --> 24:20.958
- Will he walk again?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.294
- We can't
know that for certain.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.496
We're only guessing that this is

24:25.564 --> 24:28.432
the cause of his paralysis.
- But if you're right it would

24:28.434 --> 24:31.768
save my legs.
- If we're right,

24:31.771 --> 24:34.071
and if the surgery is
successful, yes.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.973
- He can't walk as it is.

24:36.041 --> 24:39.176
What's the risk?

24:39.244 --> 24:41.045
- Well, the surgery is
highly invasive.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.448
Complications could arise and...

24:44.517 --> 24:46.483
- The risk is
that the patient could die.

24:46.552 --> 24:49.253
But I will perform the surgery,

24:49.321 --> 24:51.655
and Dr. Ogden will assist.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.626
- So, this is what we should do?
- Tom, I can't say--
- Do you believe

24:55.628 --> 24:59.029
that this is the best thing?
- Yes.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.702
- Then do it.

25:05.771 --> 25:08.105
(tense music)

25:12.678 --> 25:14.512
- The patient is stable.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.655
- We're clear to the spine,
just need to drain it.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.857
Syringe.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.560
To Dr. Ogden, please.

25:29.628 --> 25:33.430
- Doctor, this is your surgery.
- What are you doing?

25:33.499 --> 25:35.566
Finish the procedure!
- You'll finish.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.468
- I... I won't!
- Yes, you will.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.671
I'm pulling the stylus.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.639
Insert the syringe.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.641
The patient needs you.
- Doctor Dixon!

25:44.644 --> 25:46.843
- This is not a joke.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.813
This procedure must be finished
quickly and cleanly

25:49.881 --> 25:51.982
or the patient might--
- Or the patient may die.

25:52.051 --> 25:55.119
There's no one else to bring
in here. And I'm not
going to do it.

25:55.187 --> 25:58.655
So, it's up to you.
It's up to you.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.691
Save his life.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.926
- Dr. Ogden?

26:02.929 --> 26:05.429
(suspenseful music)

26:20.412 --> 26:22.679
- You bastard.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.715
How could you do that?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.823
- What was that all about?

26:32.891 --> 26:35.960
- The surgery was a success.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.898
- If this ink gets
on my furniture...

26:41.967 --> 26:43.967
- This won't take long,
Mr. Carmichael.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.769
- Next time, please call ahead.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.838
Then I'll know to be out.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.740
- Sir...

26:49.742 --> 26:51.909
- Are you quite sure?

26:55.547 --> 26:58.582
- If you don't mind,
my driver has the Apollo idling.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.751
- You have an Apollo?
- Indeed, I do.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.719
Picked it up a few weeks ago.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.589
- It's a beautiful automobile.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.659
They only sell them in Chicago.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.763
- Were you in Chicago
a few weeks ago?

27:12.831 --> 27:15.132
- Yes... I suppose I was.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.801
- Mr. Carmichael,

27:17.869 --> 27:20.570
we have spent a great deal
of time tracking your movements

27:20.639 --> 27:22.439
over the past few weeks,

27:22.507 --> 27:25.175
and no one mentioned Chicago.
- Yourself included.

27:25.243 --> 27:26.610
- So, what?
- So, when exactly

27:26.679 --> 27:28.645
did you go off
on this little sojourn?

27:28.714 --> 27:30.480
Because from everything
we've heard, you've been seen

27:30.549 --> 27:33.017
out carousing in Toronto
nearly every evening last month.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.419
- Except for the four days

27:35.487 --> 27:37.388
surrounding
Miss Palmer's murder.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.156
- Fine. You caught me.

27:39.224 --> 27:42.292
I went to Chicago a few days
before Lucille was killed.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.762
- And you decided
not to mention that?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.097
- It slipped my mind.
- An alibi for murder

27:47.099 --> 27:50.300
slipped your mind?
- Are you gonna charge me
with a crime or am I free to go?

27:50.368 --> 27:52.302
- Mr. Carmichael, why would you
ever keep that from us?

27:52.370 --> 27:54.772
I mean... are you
protecting somebody?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.174
- Good day, gentlemen.
- The hotel!

27:57.242 --> 28:00.310
That wasn't you.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.746
We believed your last
known whereabouts prior

28:02.814 --> 28:05.916
to the four days unaccounted for
was at the hotel

28:05.918 --> 28:09.019
with Miss Palmer, beginning
two days before she was killed.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.321
But you weren't there.

28:11.389 --> 28:13.357
- You were in Chicago.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.392
Which means the Mr. Carmichael

28:15.460 --> 28:17.661
who was with Miss Palmer
must have been...

28:17.663 --> 28:19.496
- Your father.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.734
(dramatic music)

28:35.714 --> 28:38.682
- Mr. Carmichael.
I'm afraid we're here--

28:38.751 --> 28:41.218
- I know why you're here.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.887
You'll find everything explained
in my confession.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.157
It's quite simple, really.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.826
I killed them all.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.696
- Sir...

28:52.765 --> 28:55.566
you can give us the details
down at the Station House.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.234
Please, come with us.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.439
- May God have mercy on my soul.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.109
- NO!
- NO!

29:13.585 --> 29:15.352
responsibility for everything.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.855
He was the one having
the affair with Lucille Palmer.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.824
Arthur tried to absorb suspicion

29:20.892 --> 29:22.926
by leaving out
the fact that he had alibi.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.395
- And John?
- Well, Grant Sutton already

29:25.464 --> 29:27.864
knew about the affair.
Once John started investigating,

29:27.933 --> 29:30.133
Carmichael tried
to kill them both.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.302
- But John survived,
so he tried to pin

29:32.370 --> 29:35.071
the murder on him instead.
What about McWorthy?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.073
- He had found out
what was going on

29:37.076 --> 29:39.109
and wasn't going
to keep quiet about it.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.078
- Carmichael did it
all on his own?

29:41.146 --> 29:43.246
- So it would seem.
If the son had

29:43.249 --> 29:46.082
any involvement, the father
covered for him one last time.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.418
- It's only a shame
we didn't get the chance

29:48.487 --> 29:51.421
to hang him ourselves.
- Sir, all of the charges

29:51.423 --> 29:54.291
against John have
been dropped, of course.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.093
I'm sorry it ever had to happen,

29:56.161 --> 29:58.595
but we did have
to follow the evidence.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.899
- I'm glad you did.

30:08.273 --> 30:10.407
♪♪♪

30:17.316 --> 30:19.516
- He turned his back
on his own patient!

30:19.518 --> 30:21.952
What if I'd been
unable to continue?

30:22.020 --> 30:25.088
What if I'd made a mistake?
- He believed you would succeed.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.557
- It was cruel! And reckless!

30:27.626 --> 30:30.427
Unforgivable.
- And what was the outcome?

30:30.495 --> 30:32.663
- Well, it was a success.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.965
John will likely
regain his mobility.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.933
- Julia... you were prepared

30:37.002 --> 30:38.935
to throw away your new career.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.538
What was the outcome for you?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.940
- Can you explain this to me,
Miss Newsome?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.476
- It's from Deakins of Canada.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.612
- Yes! They want to see
more of my book!

30:48.680 --> 30:50.948
- Why is this a bad thing?

30:51.016 --> 30:53.116
- I'm wondering how they got a
hold of it in the first place?

30:53.184 --> 30:55.686
- I sent it to them, obviously.
- Yes, I deduced that,

30:55.754 --> 30:57.621
Miss Newsome!
That's why I'm here

30:57.623 --> 30:59.556
waving my arms about in anger.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.391
- Well, that's a stupid reason
to be angry.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.627
- You took it out of my
wastebasket and sent it to them

31:03.695 --> 31:05.696
without my permission!
- You're right!

31:05.764 --> 31:08.031
It was wrong of me to take it.
But something good has

31:08.100 --> 31:10.500
come of it. Just like
when you asked me to steal

31:10.568 --> 31:12.335
subpoenaed evidence
from the Crown Attorney.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.504
- That is not the same...

31:14.572 --> 31:16.807
That is similar, but it is--
- Then rip it up.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.676
Rip it up right now.

31:19.744 --> 31:22.012
Go ahead! It's obvious
you're too afraid

31:22.080 --> 31:24.281
to write the rest of your book,
because if you do

31:24.349 --> 31:26.716
and it's not any good, it'll
prove you're not a real writer.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.985
- I'm already a real writer.
- No, you're not.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.988
(gasping)
You've written
three chapters, plus some drivel

31:32.057 --> 31:34.725
about Venusians. Oh, and that
one about the mummies.

31:34.793 --> 31:38.561
- You've read that?
- Of course not, it's nonsense!

31:38.630 --> 31:40.864
Now, what are you going to do?

31:40.933 --> 31:43.600
Give up? Or write
the rest of your book

31:43.669 --> 31:45.235
the way it's meant
to be written?

31:47.339 --> 31:49.306
(soft music)

31:49.308 --> 31:52.442
(door opening)

32:03.688 --> 32:05.488
- It seems this is the place

32:05.491 --> 32:07.490
to find Llewellyn Watts.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.559
- I like it here.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.861
The light is pleasing.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.231
- I looked for you
at the running club.

32:14.299 --> 32:17.033
- Well, I've given that up.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.069
- And replaced it with drink?

32:19.137 --> 32:21.104
- Can you think
of anything better?

32:24.743 --> 32:28.111
- Detective Watts,
we may not know the outcome

32:28.113 --> 32:31.514
of our actions,
but I do know this...

32:31.517 --> 32:34.384
There are no outcomes
without action.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.386
- Hmm.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.322
I see.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.995
Would you care
to join me for another?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.999
- I have things to do.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.435
As I hope you do as well.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.216
- Does this look familiar?
- It does!

33:06.284 --> 33:08.351
- You were right.
It was found in the alley

33:08.420 --> 33:11.154
just off of Church Street.
- Thank you.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.289
- Now, be mindful
of your surroundings.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.325
The constable will see you home.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.100
Making yourself comfortable?

33:24.103 --> 33:26.102
- Listen to this.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.104
"I purchased a gun
at a pawn shop

33:28.173 --> 33:30.240
"on the corner
of Parliament and Queen Streets,

33:30.308 --> 33:32.576
then went about
to find Grant Sutton."

33:32.644 --> 33:34.411
- That's part
of Mr. Carmichael's

33:34.479 --> 33:36.346
confession letter. What of it?
- What happened

33:36.414 --> 33:39.116
to his other gun?
- His other gun?

33:39.184 --> 33:42.119
- Only a few weeks earlier,
he shot Lucille Palmer.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.387
Then he bought a new gun
to shoot Sutton?

33:44.456 --> 33:46.322
What happened to the first gun?

33:46.325 --> 33:48.892
- I expect he disposed of it.
It was a murder weapon

33:48.960 --> 33:51.127
after all.
- He never mentions it.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.396
He provides multiple
corroborating details

33:53.465 --> 33:56.466
about the gun that killed Sutton
and the paperweight

33:56.535 --> 33:59.169
that killed McWorthy.
But there are no details

33:59.237 --> 34:01.971
supporting his claim
he murdered Lucille Palmer.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.208
- Something's not right.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.811
- Not only was there
no mention of the gun,

34:07.879 --> 34:10.046
we never found
a trace of the bullet.

34:10.115 --> 34:13.350
- Perhaps Carmichael
collected it

34:13.418 --> 34:15.419
and disposed of it

34:15.487 --> 34:18.421
along with the murder weapon.
- But from whence?

34:18.424 --> 34:21.691
- You're right.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.827
The bullet that killed
Lucille Palmer

34:23.895 --> 34:26.629
passed cleanly through her.
It had to have struck something

34:26.632 --> 34:27.931
in this room.
- And yet,

34:27.999 --> 34:30.300
there is no evidence

34:30.302 --> 34:32.869
of a bullet hole to be found.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.275
- Perhaps the reason
there is no sign of a bullet

34:39.344 --> 34:43.246
in this room is
because the bullet didn't

34:43.248 --> 34:45.749
end its trip in this room.

34:49.154 --> 34:52.355
- It's the same.
The striations are both a match

34:52.423 --> 34:54.657
for John's gun.
- Impossible.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.493
John Brackenreid
didn't kill her.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.394
- I don't believe he did either.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.296
The question is

35:00.365 --> 35:02.632
who had John's gun? And when?

35:04.702 --> 35:07.537
- Father was always a fool.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.373
It wasn't right of Lucille
to blackmail him,

35:10.441 --> 35:12.575
but surely he didn't
have to kill her.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.311
And what was he doing with her
in the first place?

35:15.380 --> 35:18.948
They would have never met
if it hadn't been for me.

35:19.017 --> 35:21.284
It's all my fault...

35:21.352 --> 35:23.153
- It's not your fault.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.288
Isabel, you didn't know.
- I should have.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.891
When he came home that night,

35:27.959 --> 35:29.926
he wouldn't even look at me.

35:29.994 --> 35:32.896
Never in a million years

35:32.964 --> 35:34.964
would I have thought
that he'd just shot two people.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.967
- The night Sutton
and I were shot?

35:37.970 --> 35:40.270
- Yes.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.373
- But you said you were
on a train to Hamilton.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.376
(tense music)

35:50.649 --> 35:52.448
- Even I didn't know
he had that gun.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.918
- Well, someone must have.
Otherwise John really did--

35:54.920 --> 35:56.986
- Wait. Isabel knew.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.422
She's in there with him now.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.829
- Why did you lie
about where you were?

36:06.898 --> 36:09.799
- Why are you questioning me?

36:09.801 --> 36:12.936
Grant Sutton shot you--
- No, he didn't.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.804
Where were you, Isabel?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.909
What are you doing?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.744
- John...

36:21.813 --> 36:23.613
please...

36:23.682 --> 36:25.615
just let me explain.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.617
- You took my gun, didn't you?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.452
Your father didn't
kill Lucille--

36:29.520 --> 36:31.354
- My father was too weak.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.356
She would have
ruined our family.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.492
(sonorous vibrations)
(gunshot)

36:35.560 --> 36:37.327
(groaning)

36:39.364 --> 36:43.032
- Your father wasn't
the one who shot me.

36:43.101 --> 36:45.435
- I had to do it.
Do you understand?

36:45.437 --> 36:47.370
- You tried to kill me!
- I didn't have a choice!

36:47.439 --> 36:49.940
- You're a murderer!

36:50.008 --> 36:52.508
- I knew about you and Lucille.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.311
OK? And I wanted to believe that
you loved me! But now, I know

36:55.380 --> 36:58.248
that you really didn't!
- What are you doing?!

36:58.250 --> 37:00.316
- OK?!

37:00.319 --> 37:02.318
We could have been
happy together, John.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.988
And now look
what you're making me do.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.990
(grunting)

37:06.992 --> 37:09.525
STOP FIGHTING IT!
- (Murdoch): POLICE!

37:09.528 --> 37:11.494
OPEN THE DOOR!

37:11.562 --> 37:14.597
(suspenseful music)

37:14.666 --> 37:16.733
(gasping)

37:23.074 --> 37:25.008
- GET OFF HIM!

37:25.010 --> 37:27.343
Are you all right, son?

37:27.346 --> 37:30.346
- Yeah, I think so.

37:30.349 --> 37:33.683
- It wasn't me, I didn't, I...

37:33.751 --> 37:36.086
- Enough. It's over,
Miss Carmichael.

37:38.556 --> 37:41.324
- You need to work on
your choice of women, John.

37:41.392 --> 37:43.560
- I have terrible taste
in women.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.768
Maybe you were.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.770
But if you ever try
anything like that again,

37:53.838 --> 37:55.572
I will have you fired.
- I don't think

37:55.640 --> 37:59.075
I'll have to, Doctor.
- I said anything like that.

37:59.143 --> 38:02.245
I'll have my eye
on you, Dr. Dixon.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.415
- I have my eye
on you, too, Julia.

38:10.221 --> 38:12.922
(grunting)

38:12.991 --> 38:15.992
- I can feel them.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.194
I don't think I can stand yet,

38:18.262 --> 38:20.096
but I can feel them.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.365
- You'll be back pounding
the beat in no time.

38:24.435 --> 38:27.270
- I don't think so.
- What?

38:27.272 --> 38:30.373
- I'm handing in
my badge, Father.

38:30.441 --> 38:34.010
I need something else.
- University?

38:34.078 --> 38:36.780
- No. I want to be an actor.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.350
- At least it's not dangerous...

38:40.352 --> 38:43.019
- Look, Father,

38:43.087 --> 38:44.854
I'm sorry I let you down.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.856
I wanted to follow
in your footsteps...

38:46.924 --> 38:49.192
but I can't.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.694
- You know I always fancied
the roar of the crowd,

38:51.697 --> 38:53.596
the smell of the grease paint.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.866
- I know.
- Good on you, John.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.168
You'll get to do
what I never did.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.704
But when you're making
your mark on the stage,

39:01.773 --> 39:04.040
you just remember one thing...

39:04.108 --> 39:06.576
once upon a time,
you used to be a copper.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.845
And a bloody good one at that.

39:08.913 --> 39:12.215
(sentimental music)

39:20.491 --> 39:22.258
- Miss Newsome.

39:22.326 --> 39:24.194
You're not working here
any longer?

39:24.262 --> 39:26.729
- Mr. Templeton figured out

39:26.798 --> 39:29.999
where you got those files.
I've been fired.

39:30.067 --> 39:33.002
- I'm sorry, I--
- Save your breath.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.238
I knew the risk
when I decided to help.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.540
You asked, but I chose to do it.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.675
Just like you chose
to finish your manuscript

39:39.744 --> 39:41.611
for that publisher.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.147
- And what makes you think
I decided to do that?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.649
- The fact that you're
not an idiot.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.819
- Not an idiot?
You know, I think that's

39:49.821 --> 39:51.488
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.590
- I won't make a habit of it.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.526
- What are you going to do now

39:56.594 --> 39:59.095
that you're out of work?
- I've had an offer already.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.365
A defense firm in London wants
me to sail immediately.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.400
- You're leaving Toronto?
- No.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.369
I've refused.

40:06.438 --> 40:09.071
Instead, I've convinced them
to open a branch in Canada.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.442
Or, rather, I will
convince them.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.710
There's a lot of crime here.
As soon as they see

40:14.713 --> 40:16.813
the statistics, they'll see
that I'm right.

40:16.881 --> 40:20.783
- And if they don't?
- I don't understand
the question.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.785
(chuckling)

40:22.854 --> 40:24.620
- Well, if you're
staying around,

40:24.689 --> 40:28.124
then perhaps you and I could
have dinner or something?

40:28.192 --> 40:31.461
- Are you courting me?

40:31.529 --> 40:34.330
- I suppose that--
- Good.

40:34.332 --> 40:37.200
Then let's start with lunch.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.669
(grunting)

40:39.737 --> 40:42.104
- You are a remarkable woman,
Miss Newsome.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.407
- Remarkable how?

40:44.409 --> 40:46.976
- Remarkably tall for one thing.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.679
- It's not me
that's big, George.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.681
It's the world that's small.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.353
- You're back.
- I am.

40:57.421 --> 41:00.256
And I intend to train
until I can beat you.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.761
Llewellyn Watts.
I never got your name.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.763
- Thomas Longboat.
Good to meet you.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.766
Now, let's go!

41:13.504 --> 41:15.271
(soft music)

41:15.339 --> 41:17.540
- (Murdoch):<i> Could I have</i>
<i> done this any differently?</i>

41:17.608 --> 41:19.842
- You pursued the truth

41:19.845 --> 41:22.078
at great expense to yourself.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.047
I hardly think that's a choice
for William Murdoch.

41:25.116 --> 41:29.151
- Aren't you even a little
disappointed that you aren't

41:29.220 --> 41:32.188
married to Toronto's
newest police inspector?

41:32.257 --> 41:34.390
- A little.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.526
- Oh.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.594
(Julia chuckling)

41:38.663 --> 41:40.396
- I am happier
that I am married to you.

41:45.469 --> 41:48.571
- Detective.
- Miss Hart.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.675
Are you happy with your choice?

41:52.677 --> 41:55.478
- What choice?

41:55.546 --> 41:57.947
- To be city coroner.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.816
- Of course!

41:59.884 --> 42:02.685
This is all I've wanted
for the last two years.

42:05.656 --> 42:08.358
- Now, there's just
something about all this

42:08.426 --> 42:10.259
that never added up.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.094
Inspector McWorthy was killed

42:12.097 --> 42:14.931
because he had turned
on the Carmichaels.

42:14.999 --> 42:17.633
- I suppose he made
the wrong choice.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.902
- That's just it.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.672
He made his decision prior
to the bullet fragment

42:22.740 --> 42:25.374
being planted
in Lucille Palmer's body.

42:25.443 --> 42:28.277
He was left out of the cover-up.

42:28.346 --> 42:31.714
- He had the key
to the cold storage room.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.749
Who else could have done it?

42:33.818 --> 42:36.786
- I can think
of only one person.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.990
- Well, they should be arrested.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.493
If you can prove it.
- I can't.

42:45.396 --> 42:49.399
And perhaps never will.
- A shame.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.102
- Shame indeed.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.338
(tense music)

42:58.276 --> 43:00.443
Good day, Miss Hart.
