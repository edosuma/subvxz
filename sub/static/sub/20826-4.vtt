Fucking evil Kraut.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.840
Always trying to trick me
by saying nice things to me.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.281
Oh. Are you's the new postman?

00:22.282 --> 00:24.763
Delivering joy in every package.

00:24.847 --> 00:26.882
I've got a special delivery...

00:29.935 --> 00:32.688
Oh, man! Oh, man!
Oh, man! Oh, man!

00:32.771 --> 00:35.649
Serves you right, you little Scheisse.

00:39.445 --> 00:42.781
Are you serious, Vic?
You never work on Saturdays.

00:42.865 --> 00:46.160
I know, but this is an emergency,
Cutie Pie.

00:46.243 --> 00:49.872
There's a big problem
and the station needs me to fix it.

00:49.955 --> 00:53.584
But we're supposed to get naked
and make cupcakes.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.794
And we will.

00:55.878 --> 00:58.505
Now, go put on your crotchless apron,
turn on Scooby Doo,

00:58.589 --> 01:01.467
and I'll be right back
to hop in your Mystery Machine.

01:14.605 --> 01:21.111
<i>We want Corey!
We want Corey! We want Corey!</i>

01:21.195 --> 01:22.988
Where is he?

01:23.072 --> 01:24.990
Where is Corey?
It's been, like, two hours.

01:25.074 --> 01:26.450
I ain't playing this shit!

01:26.533 --> 01:28.452
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:28.535 --> 01:30.662
- I don't give a shit!
- Oh, man.

01:30.746 --> 01:34.458
For the last time,
I ain't playing this record.

01:34.541 --> 01:36.376
It's a piece of bubblegum shit.

01:36.460 --> 01:39.546
Fuck you! I paid your station
a boatload of money to play his song.

01:39.630 --> 01:43.258
- That's your fucking problem!
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:43.342 --> 01:46.011
Uncle Vic's here to throw a little "nice"
on the fire.

01:46.095 --> 01:49.390
Your DJ is disrespecting my artist.

01:49.473 --> 01:51.308
Duane Allman is an artist.

01:51.392 --> 01:53.977
This kid fell out of Donny Osmond's pussy.

01:54.061 --> 01:54.895
Did not!

01:54.978 --> 01:57.439
Now, hold on. Hold on.

01:57.523 --> 02:00.025
Nobody fell out of anybody's yow-yow.

02:00.109 --> 02:03.028
Hank, you and me are gonna have
a little rap session.

02:03.112 --> 02:06.740
Look, brother,
you and I both know this record sucks,

02:06.824 --> 02:09.701
but things are tight,
and I need you to play ball.

02:09.785 --> 02:13.080
I won't do it, Vic!
I got a reputation to uphold!

02:13.163 --> 02:15.958
Oh, fuck your reputation!
Play the fucking record!

02:16.041 --> 02:18.877
How about I fuck your mother,
you fucking hippie? How about that?

02:18.961 --> 02:20.421
You like that, you fucking cunt?

02:21.797 --> 02:23.507
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:23.590 --> 02:25.384
Who stuck your pubes in a zipper?

02:27.344 --> 02:28.554
I'm so sorry.

02:28.637 --> 02:30.722
I don't do stress well.

02:31.557 --> 02:34.768
Our ratings are slipping,
the suits are coming down on me...

02:34.852 --> 02:37.062
I ain't playing this shit.

02:37.146 --> 02:40.983
Hank, my man, you care
about the purity of music, as do I,

02:41.066 --> 02:43.110
but sometimes you got to play the game.

02:43.193 --> 02:46.822
The only way to make it
less painful for us

02:46.905 --> 02:49.700
is a little tooter
of Bolivian Agreement Powder.

02:54.246 --> 02:55.998
I love you, Vic.

02:58.292 --> 03:00.169
I love this record.

03:02.254 --> 03:06.049
Seeing a momma gorilla
carry her baby gorilla makes me cry!

03:06.133 --> 03:07.759
Let's do it!

03:07.843 --> 03:10.179
<i>We want Corey!</i>

03:10.262 --> 03:13.140
Ooh, I can feel my heartbeat
through my forehead

03:13.223 --> 03:16.977
and I've got the righteous teen sensation
you've been waiting to see.

03:17.060 --> 03:21.523
Corey Mars with
"It's A Puppy Dog, Cotton Candy Day"!

03:36.497 --> 03:40.667
Can you believe that shit?
He bribed him with drugs.

03:40.751 --> 03:44.004
They're compromising
the integrity of the music business!

03:44.087 --> 03:46.882
There's no beauty in this world.

03:49.051 --> 03:52.971
Pardon me. I'd like to get
to the Kay Kyser records.

03:53.055 --> 03:55.265

for a Rustland City woman</i>

04:47.986 --> 04:50.404
<i>who's been missing since last week.</i>

04:52.239 --> 04:55.492
<i>Her disappearance was reported
by her distraught pimp,</i>

04:55.576 --> 04:58.036
<i>who goes by the name
"International Touch."</i>

04:58.120 --> 04:59.121
What's a pimp?

04:59.705 --> 05:02.332
You watch Colt Luger.
It's a black guy.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.543
No, it's not that.

05:04.626 --> 05:07.796
Well, it is that, but it's complicated.

05:07.879 --> 05:10.424
Did you take
this macaroni from the counter?

05:10.507 --> 05:13.385
- Yeah?
- Ah! I needed it for supper!

05:13.468 --> 05:15.929
I'm sorry. I love you, Daddy.

05:16.013 --> 05:18.599
Nah, you don't. Nobody does.

05:19.224 --> 05:21.560
Shit. I'll never get this done.

05:21.643 --> 05:23.186
We don't want any!

05:23.270 --> 05:24.605
- Hey, Frank.
- Oh, hey, Rosie.

05:24.688 --> 05:29.109
You ready for your first night
in the vending machine business?

05:29.192 --> 05:32.029
- Oh, thank you for this job, Rosie.
- Now, don't thank me yet.

05:32.112 --> 05:35.157
This is just a one night tryout
to see if Smokey likes you.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.034
I know.
But you still got me in the door.

05:37.117 --> 05:39.703
God, I have been going crazy
sitting around like a bum.

05:39.786 --> 05:42.831
I would've killed myself,
but I don't want to haunt my own house.

05:42.914 --> 05:45.375
Well, you're better off there
than down here.

05:46.001 --> 05:50.547
All hands on deck!
This is not a drill! We are being invaded!

05:50.630 --> 05:56.261
Scoop, these are all friendly planes.
They're supposed to land here.

05:56.887 --> 06:02.642
Again, this is an airport.
Now, give me the flare gun.

06:02.726 --> 06:04.895
I better let you go, Frank.
Good luck tonight.

06:04.978 --> 06:07.647
Smokey said he's coming over
to pick you up at 6:00.

06:07.731 --> 06:10.484
What? I thought I was
gonna meet him at the warehouse.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.861
He's coming here? To my street?

06:12.944 --> 06:15.113
- You got a problem with that?
- No, no, it's just...

06:15.197 --> 06:16.948
I know what it's "just."

06:17.032 --> 06:18.742
I vouched for you, Frank.

06:20.202 --> 06:21.411
Damn it!

06:21.495 --> 06:23.622
Just don't make me look bad.

06:25.624 --> 06:27.250
Oh, great!

06:29.127 --> 06:31.004
Come and get your slop!

06:32.047 --> 06:34.883
Not Hamburger Assistant again.

06:34.966 --> 06:37.052
Why can't Mom make dinner?

06:37.135 --> 06:39.388
Ask her. She's the one
who abandoned her post.

06:39.471 --> 06:42.808
Now, after doing all the lady work,
I got to leave to go do some man work.

06:42.891 --> 06:46.520
And is anybody gonna get me flowers
and tell me I'm beautiful? No!

06:46.603 --> 06:48.980
No one's out there
marching for old Frank Murphy!

06:49.064 --> 06:52.401
He just watches the sands
of his miserable life gather at his feet,

06:52.484 --> 06:55.195
while his wife, the "modern woman"

06:55.278 --> 06:57.781
throws on a pantsuit every morning
and just...

06:59.324 --> 07:01.743
There's my worker bee!

07:04.246 --> 07:09.042
So, the pressure's on my bosses to invent
a new product to save the company.

07:09.126 --> 07:12.087
Oh, boy, those clowns
are quick with the insults,

07:12.170 --> 07:15.590
but when it comes time for ideas
their brains take a three-hour nap.

07:25.350 --> 07:26.601
Slow down, Frank.

07:26.685 --> 07:28.311
This isn't prison.

07:28.395 --> 07:29.312
It kind of is.

07:30.063 --> 07:32.357
Look, I'm sorry I got to leave so early.

07:32.441 --> 07:34.860
It's okay.
I'm just so happy you're working.

07:34.943 --> 07:38.530
Well, it's not ideal, but it's
the best job I could get right now.

07:38.613 --> 07:42.617
Right. Of all the many, many jobs
you applied for at the employment office?

07:42.701 --> 07:44.161
Watch it.

07:44.244 --> 07:46.371
Oh, I watched it.

07:46.455 --> 07:47.998
I watched it all.

07:49.249 --> 07:50.959
Lies.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.753
Kevin, what are you talking about?

07:52.836 --> 07:54.588
No, no, no, no. Let him go. Let him go.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.923
It's just some wizard slang
nobody understands.

08:01.136 --> 08:04.097
Frank, honey, when you wash the lettuce,

08:04.181 --> 08:07.392
you need to dry it too, with paper towels.

08:07.476 --> 08:10.395
Oh, I get it.
Say what you really mean, Sue!

08:10.479 --> 08:12.063
You're embarrassed of my new job.

08:12.147 --> 08:14.316
Why don't you just get
a bumper sticker for your car,

08:14.399 --> 08:17.402
"Ask me about
my loser husband's shit job"?

08:17.486 --> 08:20.614
I don't feel like that!
But is that how you feel?

08:20.697 --> 08:24.326
Don't you put my own words in my mouth!
You think it's beneath me!

08:24.409 --> 08:25.994
Honey, I'm proud of you!

08:26.077 --> 08:27.662
We need the money, no matter...

08:27.746 --> 08:29.790
No matter how little I make! I knew it!

08:29.873 --> 08:33.626
Yeah, I'll be stocking vending machines
at night for $1.60 an hour

08:33.710 --> 08:35.712
if I'm lucky enough to even get the job!

08:35.796 --> 08:39.549
But I'm still a man, and I want
to provide for my family by working,

08:39.633 --> 08:43.761
not laying around some commie hippie pad,
feeling all groovy,

08:43.845 --> 08:45.639
eating government cheese.

08:45.722 --> 08:47.933
I've got my pride! And I'm gonna...

08:50.977 --> 08:52.646
Which house is Frank Murphy at?

08:52.729 --> 08:54.231
I'm picking him up for work!

08:55.065 --> 08:56.233
Oh, shit.

08:56.316 --> 08:58.860
That looks like that ice cream truck
that made the news

08:58.944 --> 09:00.779
and doesn't come around anymore.

09:02.155 --> 09:03.949
Hey, you're black.

09:04.032 --> 09:06.743
I work with a guy who knows
Hank Aaron's niece.

09:06.827 --> 09:09.204
Okay, show's over. Nothing to see here.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.998
Did somebody get shot?
I saw a black guy in a truck!

09:12.082 --> 09:16.545
Nobody got shot, Babe!
Go back inside, you fucking busybodies!

09:17.796 --> 09:20.131
Hi, Smokey, I'm Frank.

09:20.215 --> 09:22.217
Look like your name's Larry.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.512
Now grab a crate and try not to fall out.

09:25.595 --> 09:27.639
Whoa!

09:27.722 --> 09:29.641
What did I just say? Pay attention!

09:30.642 --> 09:33.687
Have fun, Frank.

Like, how can we ever top it?

10:05.886 --> 10:11.182
Oh, I think I hear the sound

10:11.266 --> 10:12.726

10:12.809 --> 10:14.561

It's a lie, just like everything else!

we'll never get our music heard.

10:29.117 --> 10:31.244

- We can't do that.
- Sure we can!

10:33.705 --> 10:37.208
I know where to get drugs,
and we can borrow my mom's car.

10:37.292 --> 10:41.129

12:20.270 --> 12:22.564
<i>with "I Don't Need Your Damn Help."</i>

12:22.647 --> 12:26.401
What's the matter, you never seen
the inside of a truck before?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.778
- No, it's just, that...
- I know what you thinking.

12:28.862 --> 12:30.655
You're too good for this job.

12:30.739 --> 12:33.324
That's why I didn't want to hire you
in the first place.

12:33.408 --> 12:35.493
You used to being a big shot.

12:35.577 --> 12:37.704
Now you're riding in this hoopty,

12:37.787 --> 12:43.418
next to a motherfucker
that smell like cigars, got diabetes,

12:43.501 --> 12:46.171
and got a wife that fucks another man
while he's home

12:46.254 --> 12:49.132
because she know good and damn well
he too tired to come up them stairs.

12:49.215 --> 12:50.508
Oh, I wasn't thinking that.

12:50.592 --> 12:52.719
Yeah, but now you are. You see?

12:52.802 --> 12:55.054
All you people are the same.

12:56.890 --> 12:59.559
Now, here's the deal, Frank Murphy.

12:59.642 --> 13:02.061
You got one night to prove to me
that you can do the job.

13:02.145 --> 13:05.982
Don't worry, Smokey.
I can do this. I used to run an airport.

13:06.065 --> 13:09.027
Alrighty then, Mr. Lindenbergh,

13:09.110 --> 13:12.572
but remember, you do the job right,
you're hired.

13:12.655 --> 13:17.786
You don't, you and that weird-ass neighbor
can stay home and fuck each other!

13:18.495 --> 13:21.956
Now pay attention! Your job depends on it.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.334
The first thing you do is
open up the machine,

13:24.417 --> 13:27.629
put in the crackers,
then the cookies, then the fruit pies.

13:27.712 --> 13:29.923
Not the fruit cakes, the fruit pies.

13:30.006 --> 13:32.842
Take out the cash box,
empty it into your coin sack,

13:32.926 --> 13:37.138
shove your coin sack into the front
of your pants. Sack to sack. Say it.

13:37.222 --> 13:39.057
Sack to sack. Coin to loin.

13:39.140 --> 13:42.143
Don't improvise.
This ain't jazz, motherfucker!

13:42.227 --> 13:43.728
Check the change for slugs.

13:44.270 --> 13:46.731
People try to put all kind of shit
in these machines.

13:46.815 --> 13:49.400
One time I took out
a big old toenail on a string.

13:49.484 --> 13:52.612
Slick motherfucker got me
for five Clark bars and a Nutter Butter.

13:52.695 --> 13:54.364
Now, Hershey bars are different.

13:54.447 --> 13:56.991
They're the queen bitch
of the whole operation.

13:57.075 --> 13:58.535
They're delicate.

13:58.618 --> 14:01.496
You got to be careful
when you're loading them. Pay attention.

14:02.038 --> 14:05.333
You slide the bars in.

14:05.416 --> 14:06.334
Like this?

14:06.417 --> 14:08.419
Don't shove them in like an animal!

14:08.503 --> 14:11.381
Slide 'em in.

14:11.464 --> 14:13.967
Like you're making love to your woman.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.886
You got to slide 'em in.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.889
Got to slide 'em in.

14:20.682 --> 14:22.642
- You got that?
- Got it.

14:24.561 --> 14:26.271
Goddamn it, Frank Murphy.

14:26.729 --> 14:30.775
Maybe you can leave doors open
in your neighborhood, but not around here.

14:30.859 --> 14:32.026
Sorry. Sorry.

14:32.110 --> 14:34.529
That's your first strike.
One more and you're out.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.780
Don't you get three strikes?

14:35.864 --> 14:40.326
Not in American Legion co-ed softball,
only league I recognize!

14:41.494 --> 14:45.373
Now watch and learn.
Shove it, slam it, twist the lock.

14:45.456 --> 14:48.001
Stick the key inside your sock.

14:48.084 --> 14:50.170
Why can't the key just be on the key ring?

14:50.253 --> 14:54.674
Because, the rhyme came first,
system came later.

15:00.805 --> 15:03.099
All right, I landed on Colt.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.726
Got you, dirtbag.

15:04.809 --> 15:08.938
Go to the San Cortez Regional
Correctional Institute for kids!

15:09.022 --> 15:10.523
- Oh, man.
- My turn.

15:13.776 --> 15:15.653
You just smacked a broad.

15:15.737 --> 15:17.322
Roll again.

15:17.405 --> 15:19.407
Ahh. This is just what I've needed.

15:19.490 --> 15:22.076
A nice, quiet night with my kids.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.578
My turn.

15:24.871 --> 15:27.123
Oh, washing machine.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.250
Your father said he was gonna fix it.

15:29.334 --> 15:32.337
He also said he was gonna
take me to the eye doctor.

15:34.255 --> 15:36.925
- Is it happening again?
- No. No.

15:42.597 --> 15:44.974
Well, shine my shoes!

15:47.769 --> 15:50.021
At least the spin cycle works now.

15:50.104 --> 15:52.565
We should've put
your father's soggy lettuce in there.

15:52.649 --> 15:54.953
Good one, Mom!

15:55.944 --> 15:57.362
Mom?

15:58.029 --> 15:59.113
<i> Plast-A-Ware's in trouble!</i>

15:59.197 --> 16:01.241
<i> Everyone think up
an exciting, new product!</i>

16:01.324 --> 16:03.117
<i>Everybody except Sue!</i>

16:05.078 --> 16:07.038
<i>I'd like to be in her fantasy!</i>

16:26.783 --> 16:28.101
<i>It spin dries lettuce.</i>

16:28.184 --> 16:29.686
<i>- Unbelievable!
- What an invention!</i>

16:29.769 --> 16:32.939
<i>- That's incredible!
- I've never seen anything so great!</i>

16:33.022 --> 16:33.940
<i>She's a genius!</i>

16:34.023 --> 16:37.068
<i>Oh, my God,
what an incredible invention!</i>

16:41.864 --> 16:44.502
Eat that, you fuckers.

16:44.534 --> 16:47.120
Mommy, your smile is scaring me.

16:50.873 --> 16:54.502
<i>Ooh, that was American Flag
with "Winnipeg Rock,"</i>

16:54.585 --> 17:00.717
<i>and you are listening to Howlin' Hank's
all night throbbing e-rock-tion.</i>

17:00.800 --> 17:03.803
- Are you sure we can score coke here?
- Totally.

17:03.886 --> 17:06.013
This neighborhood's always on the news:

17:06.097 --> 17:07.698
"Drug Dealer Murdered",

17:07.699 --> 17:10.101
"Toddler Washed Away By Open Hydrant",

17:10.184 --> 17:14.146
"Three Teens in Mother's Car
Killed in Drug Buy Gone Wrong."

17:14.230 --> 17:16.858
Wow, that could be us.

17:18.151 --> 17:19.193
That could be us!

17:19.277 --> 17:22.030
One way or another,
we're getting famous tonight!

17:22.113 --> 17:24.615
Immortality forever!

17:26.075 --> 17:29.829
Okay, Frank Murphy.
So far, so shitty.

17:29.912 --> 17:33.791
But at least you're doing better than the
last two guys I tried out on this route.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.836
You ain't quit after a half an hour,
and I ain't shot you.

17:36.919 --> 17:39.464
I'm not gonna quit. I need this too much.

17:40.048 --> 17:42.800
I already lied to my wife
about how I got this job,

17:42.884 --> 17:45.011
I don't know what lie I'd tell her
if I lost it.

17:45.094 --> 17:47.555
Youse a desperate motherfucker.

17:47.638 --> 17:49.015
I like that!

17:49.098 --> 17:50.725
- Catch!
- What's this?

17:50.808 --> 17:53.436
The second-best thing about this job.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.938
You get to keep the damaged ones
and the stales.

17:59.692 --> 18:03.529
Ugh! This soda is as flat as your ass,
but it's free.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.074
There was a mouse in mine.

18:08.785 --> 18:11.037
Get ready to be a hero, Frank Murphy.

18:12.121 --> 18:15.249
What's happening, everybody?
It's the rubber man!

18:15.333 --> 18:17.335
- All right!
- Rubber man is here!

18:19.170 --> 18:22.965
- Fill it up so I can fill it up!
- This one's ribbed for my pleasure.

18:23.049 --> 18:24.799
Where the fuck
were you last week?

18:25.426 --> 18:26.511
How about that guy?

18:26.594 --> 18:28.262
- He looks like a drug dealer.
- No.

18:28.346 --> 18:30.306
He's not wearing a vest with no shirt.

18:30.890 --> 18:34.102
- How about that guy?
- No. He only has one gold tooth.

18:34.185 --> 18:36.396
You're too chicken to do this, man.

18:37.146 --> 18:39.732
Pull over here.
I'll show you how it's done.

18:42.235 --> 18:46.280
First of all,
I am sorry for the loss of Dr. King.

18:46.364 --> 18:48.533
You idiot!
You don't talk to them like that.

18:48.616 --> 18:49.867
It's cool. It's cool.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.286
You boys looking for something?

18:52.370 --> 18:54.580
Something to make you feel good?

18:54.664 --> 18:56.499
- Shit yes.
- Now we're talking.

18:56.582 --> 18:59.377
- You looking for that white stuff?
- Yes, sir.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.754
- Ten dollars.
- Deal!

19:02.755 --> 19:04.799
Bring it over!

19:04.882 --> 19:07.552
All right, Murph!
What a bargain!

19:07.635 --> 19:09.345
Hey, boys.

19:09.429 --> 19:12.682
If you got a sandwich bag,
I'll fuck all y'all.

19:16.686 --> 19:17.895
Fucking queers!

19:17.979 --> 19:20.231
Don't you mess with
"International Touch"!

19:20.314 --> 19:25.236
Oh, damn. I can't keep this
titty in to save my life.

19:25.319 --> 19:27.179
Bitch, get out of the street!

19:30.116 --> 19:31.784
<i>You just killed a civilian.</i>

19:31.868 --> 19:33.619
<i>Plant a gun on him and go eat a steak.</i>

19:33.703 --> 19:34.620
It's your turn, Mom.

19:36.664 --> 19:40.084
- Mom?
- Kids, Mom's gonna do a little drawing.

19:40.168 --> 19:41.836
Just... watch TV.

19:42.545 --> 19:44.839
Uh, even though it's almost bed time?

19:44.922 --> 19:47.008
Don't tell her that, you narc!

19:47.091 --> 19:50.136
- You can stay up a little later.
- Yay!

19:50.219 --> 19:52.555
<i>My visit to the Sag Harbor Nudist Colony</i>

19:52.638 --> 19:57.226
<i>revealed that this philosophy
is shared by people of all ages.</i>

19:57.310 --> 20:01.105
<i>Well, this tattoo used
to be my wife's face.</i>

20:03.441 --> 20:06.694
- All set.
- Good job, Frank Murphy.

20:06.777 --> 20:08.154
Thanks, Smokey.

20:08.237 --> 20:11.991
You know, Frank Murphy, you all right.
You're gonna like this job.

20:12.074 --> 20:15.870
Captain of your own ship.
Ain't nobody telling you what to do.

20:15.953 --> 20:19.207
Not even stop signs.
Fuck you, sign!

20:19.290 --> 20:22.043
Yep, just the romance of the road.

20:22.126 --> 20:23.377
Does that mean I got the job?

20:23.461 --> 20:28.466
Well, I was gonna make you beg for it
just a little bit, but let's just say...

20:31.135 --> 20:32.845
Oh, shit! The money sacks!

20:34.639 --> 20:38.267
Told you to latch the fucking door!
That's a whole night's take!

20:38.351 --> 20:40.228
Strike two! You failed!

20:40.311 --> 20:41.395
No, I can't!

20:42.438 --> 20:43.773
Get back in the damn truck!

20:43.856 --> 20:46.025
No! I'm gonna make this right!

20:46.108 --> 20:48.486
Then fuck the pennies, grab them quarters!

20:52.114 --> 20:55.910
<i>Ooh, I swear I'm addicted
to this next song!</i>

20:55.993 --> 21:00.164
<i>- Here's Corey Mars with...
- Turn that fucker off!</i>

21:00.248 --> 21:01.707
What a disaster.

21:01.791 --> 21:05.378
Our money's gone, our careers are over
before they even started.

21:05.461 --> 21:07.713
Well, I guess we won't ever be rockers.

21:07.797 --> 21:10.716
We'll have to get boring jobs,
like being a dentist.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.301
Or the guy who knocks cows out.

21:12.385 --> 21:15.721
Things could be worse.
We could be that guy.

21:18.849 --> 21:20.017
Dad?

21:21.477 --> 21:23.229
Yeah! I got a nickel!

21:23.312 --> 21:25.940
No fucking way is that gonna be me!

21:26.023 --> 21:29.326
Bolo, we're going to that radio station.

21:29.652 --> 21:33.072
- Turn this car around!
- Aye-aye, captain!

21:37.660 --> 21:40.454
I meant wait until it was safe to do so!

21:40.538 --> 21:43.040
That ain't rock 'n' roll!

21:45.793 --> 21:47.670
Just one more to go!

21:48.296 --> 21:51.507
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- I'm not losing this job!

21:54.635 --> 21:57.430
I did it, Smokey! I got 'em all!

22:01.183 --> 22:02.268
Fuck!

22:03.227 --> 22:05.479
Fuck! Go, go, go!

22:05.563 --> 22:07.988
Shove! Slam!
Twist the lock!

22:09.442 --> 22:11.027
Fuck you, you...

22:12.903 --> 22:16.365
I won't come back until that fucking DJ
has listened to our song.

22:16.449 --> 22:18.576
Into the flames, rock god!

22:20.661 --> 22:21.954
Hey! Where you going, kid?

22:22.038 --> 22:24.957
- To claim my destiny!
- Oh, okay.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.626
Why are our ratings so low?

22:27.710 --> 22:29.670
People aren't listening to the station.

22:29.754 --> 22:31.630
Well, there's got to be another reason!

22:31.714 --> 22:35.468
Here's the new one from Tin Chicken.

22:35.551 --> 22:37.345
I need you to play this tape!

22:37.428 --> 22:41.432
Whoa, kid,
demo tapes go in the lobby trash can.

22:41.515 --> 22:45.019
No way! We spent almost
three hours working on this!

22:45.102 --> 22:46.729
Hold on there, star child.

22:46.812 --> 22:48.439
Kevin, you don't belong here.

22:48.522 --> 22:51.609
No. You don't belong here,
and you don't belong here,

22:51.692 --> 22:52.777
you fucking sellouts!

22:52.860 --> 22:55.738
You said you care
about the purity of music?

22:55.821 --> 22:59.762
Well, if that's true and you
have one shred of self-respect

22:59.763 --> 23:03.704
left in your souls, you will
listen to the future of rock!

23:03.788 --> 23:06.332
Wait. Hang on, play this side.

23:06.415 --> 23:08.891
The other side's my oral report
on Johnny Tremain.

23:09.210 --> 23:12.088
Kevin, when you've been in this business
as long as I have,

23:12.171 --> 23:14.548
it's easy to lose sight
of what's important.

23:14.632 --> 23:19.261
Thank you for reminding me that it's
what's in your soul that really counts.

23:19.345 --> 23:21.514
Well, buddy,
you got your balls in the door.

23:21.597 --> 23:23.307
Let's see if those balls can sing.

Frank Murphy, there's a term
us Snack Jacks use.

24:35.379 --> 24:36.922
It's called "it."

24:37.006 --> 24:38.924
And you got "it."

24:39.008 --> 24:42.678
And I'm gonna put "it"
in this truck five nights a week.

24:45.055 --> 24:47.766
Take her home.
You start tomorrow.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.269
Thanks, Smokey.
I won't let you down.
