WEBVTT

00:59.500 --> 01:01.300
After discovering
a necklace left by Hyun-jun,

01:01.934 --> 01:05.033
Sa-woo senses that Hyun-jun is
related to the terrorist organization.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.800
By giving false information,

01:20.166 --> 01:23.133
the terrorist organization keeps
Sa-woo and the combat army away

01:23.667 --> 01:25.333
and infiltrates the NSS.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.633
After arriving late at the NSS,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.433
Seung-hee fights
against the terrorist attack

01:44.033 --> 01:46.533
and comes face to face
with Hyun-jun in disguise.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
Don't move.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.967
EPISODE 11

02:07.700 --> 02:08.567
Don't move.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.367
Drop the gun.

02:38.266 --> 02:39.333
Drop the gun.

02:52.834 --> 02:53.867
Drop the gun now.

03:26.133 --> 03:27.467
Don't move.

03:46.934 --> 03:47.900
Drop the gun.

04:07.934 --> 04:08.967
Hyun-jun.

04:09.734 --> 04:10.834
Hyun-jun.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.000
Hyun-jun, wake up. Hyun-jun.

04:13.667 --> 04:14.700
Wake up, Hyun-jun.

04:25.667 --> 04:26.700
It's ready to explode.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.500
Let's begin.

04:30.066 --> 04:30.900
Fire in the hole!

04:39.700 --> 04:41.066
The entrance has been breached.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.834
We leave now. Everyone, get ready.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.967
Okay, sir.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.767
Keep your heads down and stay still.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.400
Shouldn't we do something?

05:05.000 --> 05:05.867
Just wait.

05:06.033 --> 05:06.967
There's no one here now.

05:07.667 --> 05:08.633
Now is our chance.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.500
Installation complete.

05:31.266 --> 05:33.100
Okay, come to the meeting point.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.166
A3, answer me.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.533
Where's your location?

06:10.367 --> 06:12.633
Third floor basement. I'll be right there.

06:16.033 --> 06:16.934
Hyun-jun.

06:19.066 --> 06:20.066
Hyun-jun.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.767
Hyun-jun.

06:22.533 --> 06:23.600
Hyun-jun.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.433
I saw Seung-hee.

06:42.667 --> 06:43.667
Seung-hee is alive.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.233
Seung-hee was alive.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.433
Hyun-jun.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.367
You can't go. You must leave now.

06:53.467 --> 06:54.333
Move.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.433
The entrance is breached.
Supporting force will arrive.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.367
Move.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.266
Turn around.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.400
We have to leave now.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.834
You can't go now.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.266
What did you do to Seung-hee?

07:41.767 --> 07:42.734
Don't worry.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.033
She just lost her consciousness.

07:48.867 --> 07:49.834
I have to see Seung-hee.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.166
Then what?

07:52.700 --> 07:53.967
What are you going to do?

07:55.800 --> 07:57.266
What can you do when you see her?

07:58.734 --> 07:59.633
If you get caught here,

08:01.333 --> 08:03.233
no one will believe you.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.233
You must escape here first.

08:07.734 --> 08:09.667
Think about why we've come

08:11.400 --> 08:12.533
this far.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.033
What are you doing?

08:35.266 --> 08:36.467
What are you doing here?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.867
I was chasing the one
who contacted outside.

08:44.867 --> 08:47.133
The SWAT will soon arrive
to the situation room.

08:47.867 --> 08:48.867
You must leave now.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.033
Okay.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.967
Follow me.

08:59.033 --> 08:59.967
Didn't you hear him?

09:00.367 --> 09:01.367
You must come now.

09:06.266 --> 09:07.166
Let's go.

09:07.567 --> 09:08.533
Let's go now.

09:19.633 --> 09:20.633
Where is everyone else?

09:21.133 --> 09:22.033
They aren't responding.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.433
They're coming in now.

09:42.767 --> 09:43.700
Get ready.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.934
Turn off the lights.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.800
Stop the fire.

10:48.900 --> 10:49.834
Stop the fire.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.967
Stop the fire.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.133
Stop the fire.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.266
Everything is fine here.

11:30.867 --> 11:31.767
Is everyone okay?

11:32.900 --> 11:33.834
We're the only ones here.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.500
Where's Seung-hee?

11:35.767 --> 11:37.467
Isn't she with the inspectors?

11:38.100 --> 11:39.233
She was definitely in the area.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.567
Come to the small situation room.

11:45.066 --> 11:45.967
What's going on?

11:46.033 --> 11:46.967
It's an explosive.

11:47.033 --> 11:48.567
The countdown has started.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.233
TK2.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.066
Power in the situation room
is being restored.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.300
What type of bomb is it?

12:01.367 --> 12:03.500
It's an RDX-type explosive

12:03.567 --> 12:04.834
connected to electronic detonator.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.867
How much time remains?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.467
We have five minutes 21 seconds.

12:07.633 --> 12:08.600
Can you turn it off?

12:13.734 --> 12:14.633
I'll try.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.166
Supporting force is here.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.367
All members of the SWAT
including the supporting force

12:19.433 --> 12:22.166
take noncombatant and injured members out

12:22.233 --> 12:23.467
within four minutes.

12:53.266 --> 12:54.233
Hey.

12:54.467 --> 12:55.400
Hey.

12:55.467 --> 12:56.367
Where's Seung-hee?

12:56.433 --> 12:57.400
Did you see her?

12:57.567 --> 12:58.734
She left after saving me.

12:58.967 --> 12:59.800
To where?

12:59.867 --> 13:00.867
I don't know.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.367
Goodness.

13:06.700 --> 13:07.567
Hey.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.266
Everyone on the floor will evacuate

13:09.333 --> 13:10.433
within two minutes.

13:11.567 --> 13:12.800
About 20 injured members

13:12.867 --> 13:14.300
are on the way to the hospital.

13:15.834 --> 13:16.800
Have you seen Seung-hee?

13:17.367 --> 13:18.266
No, sir.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.567
How many got injured?

13:19.633 --> 13:20.900
At the moment...

13:44.233 --> 13:45.333
How much time do we have?

13:45.934 --> 13:47.333
We have two minutes and twenty seconds.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.467
Can you deactivate it?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.333
It's not connected

13:55.667 --> 13:56.967
to anything else but a detonator,

13:57.633 --> 13:58.800
but I'll check one more time.

14:00.667 --> 14:01.667
It'll be fine.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.700
Pray for it.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.266
How did it go?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
The explosive

14:35.133 --> 14:36.200
has been deactivated.

15:20.433 --> 15:22.233
Seung-hee, Seung-hee.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.100
Call the ambulance.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.200
Ambulance.

16:11.633 --> 16:12.567
Ms. Choi.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.433
Call the ambulance.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.500
Ms. Choi.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.600
Wake up, Ms. Choi.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.567
Wake up.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.633
Ambulance.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.133
Don't move.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.433
Drop the gun.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.567
Did something happen to him?

17:23.266 --> 17:24.133
No.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.700
Why?

17:25.767 --> 17:28.433
Something is wrong
after he's back from the NSS.

17:29.433 --> 17:30.467
He killed

17:31.066 --> 17:33.000
his colleagues from not so long ago.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.734
Of course he feels unsettled.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.333
Nothing will happen,

17:39.166 --> 17:40.266
so don't worry.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.433
Everyone

17:53.400 --> 17:55.467
thinks something's wrong with you.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.567
I know you're confused,

18:00.233 --> 18:01.533
but it won't be good if you don't

18:02.033 --> 18:03.000
get your act together.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.066
Emergency protocol and the server lock
have been cancelled.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.266
Everything in the system
is working normally.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.467
Thank you.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.166
That was cool.

18:37.633 --> 18:38.500
What?

18:38.567 --> 18:40.000
You thought of locking the server

18:40.500 --> 18:41.600
as an emergency protocol.

18:42.133 --> 18:43.133
Isn't that basic?

18:43.934 --> 18:46.200
I couldn't think straight.

18:46.633 --> 18:48.433
An operator should use
the computer to fight.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.934
Why did you try to use a gun?

18:51.233 --> 18:52.066
Hey.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.233
Mi-jeong is right.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.133
Everyone could have been in danger
because of your gun.

18:59.066 --> 19:00.734
Currently, 11 died

19:01.300 --> 19:02.600
and six are injured.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.233
More people will die, however.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.467
Casualties

19:07.700 --> 19:08.867
are security agents.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.100
As combat agents were out,

19:13.066 --> 19:14.266
the damage was greater.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.100
Any analysis on the terrorists?

19:16.467 --> 19:17.934
We sent three cadavers

19:18.533 --> 19:19.867
to Forensic Science Division.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.633
The fact that they took
the chance while the SWAT

19:23.767 --> 19:24.867
were sent outside,

19:25.900 --> 19:28.500
infiltrated by avoiding
biometrics elevator

19:28.567 --> 19:29.400
and

19:29.767 --> 19:32.266
used the emergency shutdown

19:33.233 --> 19:35.867
shows they gained detailed
information on the NSS beforehand

19:36.500 --> 19:39.367
or have someone who's related to the NSS.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.500
Why did they attack the NSS?

19:42.300 --> 19:44.000
It's for the R&D room.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.400
The R&D room?

19:47.467 --> 19:48.700
Their target was

19:49.700 --> 19:52.100
security safe equipment in the R&D room.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.934
It hasn't been announced to anyone.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.133
Okay.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.100
I'll be right there.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.100
Who called?

20:10.066 --> 20:11.100
The Blue House.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.867
How could this happen?

20:19.233 --> 20:23.100
People who should have stopped
the terrorists invited them in instead.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.567
How is this possible?

20:25.900 --> 20:29.333
Do you know who attacked the NSS?

20:29.767 --> 20:30.967
We're figuring it out.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.934
Shouldn't we call the chairman
of the NIS to account?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.133
Delegation from the North are here.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.266
If they find out about this,

20:38.900 --> 20:40.266
how embarrassing would it be?

20:48.834 --> 20:50.500
The President wants to see you.

21:00.834 --> 21:01.967
I will take

21:03.633 --> 21:05.367
full responsibility and resign.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.533
Even if you resign,

21:09.333 --> 21:10.533
you must sort it out.

21:11.133 --> 21:12.033
First,

21:12.867 --> 21:15.800
with the focus on
identifying the terrorists,

21:16.600 --> 21:17.767
we started the investigation.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.066
More importantly,

21:20.633 --> 21:22.467
did you find out why they attacked

21:23.433 --> 21:24.767
the NSS?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.166
If they're bold enough

21:26.567 --> 21:29.367
to infiltrate the NSS,

21:31.433 --> 21:33.700
they must have a particular purpose.

21:34.867 --> 21:35.967
In the report,

21:38.900 --> 21:40.400
there's something we didn't mention.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.667
What is it?

21:43.467 --> 21:44.967
An important equipment

21:46.166 --> 21:47.900
that the NSS kept disappeared.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.800
It's an ultra-precision remote detonator.

21:52.367 --> 21:53.500
A detonator?

21:54.367 --> 21:56.200
It's an electronic detonator

21:57.100 --> 21:58.367
that initiates a nuclear bomb

21:59.066 --> 22:00.567
when combined with concentrated uranium.

22:02.033 --> 22:03.000
Are you

22:03.834 --> 22:05.567
talking about a nuclear bomb?

22:06.066 --> 22:08.567
Inside the detonator the NSS had,

22:09.533 --> 22:11.667
there was no concentrated uranium.

22:12.367 --> 22:15.166
It's not easy to get a hold of it.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.266
However,

22:16.867 --> 22:19.734
if someone who has concentrated uranium

22:19.800 --> 22:21.300
took the detonator,

22:22.266 --> 22:24.100
it's possible to detonate

22:26.066 --> 22:28.467
a highly explosive nuclear bomb anywhere.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.133
Are you saying

22:31.066 --> 22:32.734
the terrorists have a nuclear bomb?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.166
We think so.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.066
Where are you?

23:48.133 --> 23:49.333
We escaped safely

23:49.400 --> 23:50.600
and we're waiting now.

23:50.967 --> 23:51.967
Do we have any loss?

23:52.066 --> 23:53.400
We lost three men.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.667
To proceed our next mission,

23:56.567 --> 23:58.066
we need supporting force.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.467
Remain in hiding until I call you back.

24:00.633 --> 24:01.600
Okay, sir.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.166
We need supporting force.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.333
Okay, sir.

24:26.100 --> 24:26.967
Once

24:27.200 --> 24:29.233
they bring concentrated uranium,

24:29.367 --> 24:31.433
you must combine it with the detonator.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.367
Can you do it?

24:33.934 --> 24:34.967
Yes, sir.

24:35.266 --> 24:36.200
Everyone

24:36.533 --> 24:38.000
is curious about what this is.

24:38.333 --> 24:39.867
We can't let them know yet.

24:40.633 --> 24:41.667
Keep it a secret.

24:43.266 --> 24:44.500
Okay, sir.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.533
What?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.633
Was it a woman who killed

24:48.900 --> 24:49.934
Gyu-dong and Myeong-su?

24:50.333 --> 24:51.233
Yes.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.400
She even called outside.

24:55.033 --> 24:56.266
Those idiots...

24:56.967 --> 24:59.033
Why did they get killed by a woman?

24:59.433 --> 25:00.734
What happened to her?

25:01.233 --> 25:02.133
Is she killed?

25:03.600 --> 25:04.500
No.

25:04.934 --> 25:05.767
Do you

25:06.734 --> 25:07.867
remember her face?

25:19.667 --> 25:20.533
Everyone,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.467
unless we give you another order,

25:22.567 --> 25:23.667
stay here for a while.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.333
When will we receive an order?

25:25.633 --> 25:26.867
I don't know that.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.934
Where did he go?

25:33.166 --> 25:34.133
He's outside.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.133
Don't leave him alone.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.200
Watch him carefully.

25:41.133 --> 25:42.066
Yes, sir.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.333
Starting from now,

26:53.500 --> 26:54.900
talk casually.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.633
You won't regret it?

26:57.700 --> 26:58.800
Why would I?

26:59.233 --> 27:00.400
-Go on.
-Okay.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.033
Choi Seung-hee.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.166
What?

27:04.967 --> 27:06.333
It's nice and awkward.

27:06.533 --> 27:07.500
That's good.

28:39.633 --> 28:40.667
Whatever the reason may be,

28:42.100 --> 28:43.333
I can't do it.

28:43.834 --> 28:46.266
If you can't do it,
I'll look for someone else.

28:47.266 --> 28:48.900
Tell Choi Seung-hee to come in.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.533
If you aren't sure of your ambition
because of conscience or responsibility,

29:07.400 --> 29:09.467
you can't achieve anything.

29:15.000 --> 29:15.934
In that regard,

29:16.934 --> 29:18.667
I wasn't wrong

29:19.300 --> 29:20.400
to choose you.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.467
Aren't I right?

29:56.667 --> 29:57.633
It's me.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.033
What is it?

29:59.100 --> 30:01.767
- I'd like to talk to you in person.
-I don't have time for that.

30:02.000 --> 30:02.867
Call me later.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.000
I must

30:04.767 --> 30:06.467
see you right now.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.200
What's wrong with you?

30:10.300 --> 30:11.200
Have you been drinking?

30:11.266 --> 30:12.233
Yes.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.834
Since this is too much to take
without drinking,

30:16.233 --> 30:17.300
I drank a bit.

30:18.367 --> 30:20.133
I had a shot thinking about Hyun-jun.

30:21.767 --> 30:23.200
Another one for Seung-hee.

30:25.066 --> 30:27.233
One more to resent you

30:31.200 --> 30:33.033
for changing my life completely.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.633
As I drank like that,

30:38.900 --> 30:40.033
I got drunk.

30:42.266 --> 30:43.900
Why did you choose me?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.467
Why did you choose me

30:48.033 --> 30:49.600
and put me at the end of a cliff?

30:51.567 --> 30:53.233
Sa-woo, remember my words.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.867
I chose you,

30:56.133 --> 30:57.834
but you made the final decision.

30:58.367 --> 31:00.066
How can you blame me?

31:00.467 --> 31:01.900
If you talk nonsense

31:02.200 --> 31:04.200
while being so emotional again,

31:05.867 --> 31:07.333
I won't forgive you then.

31:33.667 --> 31:34.533
Sir.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.033
Are the autopsy results out?

31:36.100 --> 31:36.934
Not yet.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.567
Have you identified the terrorists?

31:39.767 --> 31:40.700
No.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.433
But what's certain is...

31:43.467 --> 31:46.700
that someone from the NSS
helped the terrorists.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.700
They infiltrated
despite the security system.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.734
What's important

31:52.200 --> 31:54.333
is that they used an emergency shutdown.

31:55.066 --> 31:59.233
Unless someone works in the NSS,
no one knows of that system.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.600
Who could it be within the NSS?

32:04.967 --> 32:07.400
I'm not certain enough to say who.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.133
How's Seung-hee?

32:16.867 --> 32:18.367
She'll be released from the hospital soon.

32:19.834 --> 32:20.834
Did you find out anything?

32:20.900 --> 32:24.400
Forensic Science Division is
analyzing the body and the items.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.000
They haven't found anything yet.

32:27.166 --> 32:30.400
Did they find out why
they attacked the NSS?

32:33.367 --> 32:34.533
Let me talk to you.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.066
A detonator?

32:44.200 --> 32:46.467
It's an ultra-precision detonator
with the uncertainty level of

32:46.533 --> 32:47.834
less than one-millionth of a second.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.400
Its function passed
the high explosive test.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.800
If it was a high explosive test,

32:53.300 --> 32:54.633
is it a nuclear weapon?

32:54.734 --> 32:57.233
It becomes a nuclear weapon
when combined with nuclear materials.

32:57.533 --> 33:01.200
If used in the center of Seoul,
the Blue House, National Assembly,

33:01.533 --> 33:03.767
and the government office
building will be directly damaged.

33:04.166 --> 33:05.500
Expected casualty

33:05.734 --> 33:07.033
is at least 150,000 people.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.033
It's a top secret only
the superior officials know,

33:10.367 --> 33:12.200
so remain silent until ordered otherwise.

33:15.867 --> 33:16.734
Yes.

33:17.767 --> 33:18.734
Okay.

33:19.467 --> 33:20.600
I'll be right there.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.567
Okay.

33:26.467 --> 33:29.800
Isn't it also possible to be taken
outside the country?

33:30.967 --> 33:33.900
Then it becomes even more serious.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.567
Our government will be
under political and economic

33:38.266 --> 33:40.033
pressure from the world.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.066
Starting now, everyone at the NSS

33:44.600 --> 33:47.567
will focus on catching the suspect
who stole the detonator.

33:48.367 --> 33:51.600
Investigate all nuclear-related
materials in Korea

33:51.967 --> 33:53.867
and track down all smuggling
of nuclear materials.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.233
Okay, sir.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.433
Discuss with the military and the police
to set the security level to its max.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.967
Okay, sir.

34:02.066 --> 34:06.100
Meeting with the North Korean
delegation is going smoothly.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.300
Before they go back to the North,

34:10.467 --> 34:12.900
set up an appointment so I can meet them.

34:14.233 --> 34:15.867
Okay, sir.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.400
Is there something you'd like to say?

34:22.834 --> 34:24.233
Yes.

34:25.633 --> 34:28.934
There's something I don't understand.

34:29.633 --> 34:30.867
Please go on.

34:31.367 --> 34:32.333
Did you

34:33.000 --> 34:35.100
receive any report from Director Baek

34:36.200 --> 34:38.967
that I'm not aware of?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.133
Director Baek's report only shows

34:43.100 --> 34:46.533
damage to the NSS
due to a terrorist attack.

34:47.633 --> 34:48.633
It didn't

34:49.300 --> 34:53.300
include why the terrorists
infiltrated the NSS.

34:54.867 --> 34:56.934
Logically speaking,

34:57.700 --> 34:59.667
unless they had a purpose,

35:00.100 --> 35:02.767
they wouldn't infiltrate the NSS.

35:03.867 --> 35:04.867
There was a purpose,

35:05.934 --> 35:08.166
but I don't think
it's the right time to reveal it yet.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.133
I see.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.066
If that's what you think,

35:13.767 --> 35:15.533
I won't ask more.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.066
What I'd like to say is,

35:21.900 --> 35:23.133
don't trust

35:24.033 --> 35:25.533
Director Baek so much.

35:31.900 --> 35:32.834
It's me.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.667
Only the President knows
in the Blue House.

35:39.233 --> 35:42.934
He intends to proceed with the summit.

35:45.266 --> 35:46.233
Yes.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.367
Even if they threaten us,

35:49.734 --> 35:52.967
I don't think the President
will change his mind.

35:54.433 --> 35:55.400
Yes.

35:56.033 --> 35:57.333
I'll call you later.

36:17.367 --> 36:18.200
This way, sir.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.567
How many entrances between
the outside and the lobby are there?

36:33.033 --> 36:34.500
There is a total of six.

36:53.667 --> 36:55.567
Are there blind spots where

36:55.934 --> 36:57.500
an outsider may use?

36:58.567 --> 37:00.900
Except for private spaces for guests,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.467
almost everywhere is monitored.

37:06.033 --> 37:07.233
During the summit,

37:07.533 --> 37:09.600
may we place our agents here?

37:10.233 --> 37:12.300
As you wish.

37:16.266 --> 37:18.900
Who are these terrorists?

37:20.033 --> 37:20.867
Is it possible that

37:21.834 --> 37:23.166
they're from the North?

37:24.867 --> 37:26.800
I don't think they would

37:27.000 --> 37:28.934
with the forthcoming summit.

37:29.934 --> 37:31.300
What does the President think?

37:32.500 --> 37:35.567
He's still determined
to proceed with the summit.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.867
They toured everywhere
including the security room.

37:44.367 --> 37:45.333
Have a seat.

37:59.867 --> 38:00.900
What did you think

38:01.233 --> 38:02.266
after taking a look around?

38:02.467 --> 38:04.700
It looks good enough
to use as a place to stay

38:05.133 --> 38:06.433
and hold conference meetings.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.800
However, a security issue--

38:08.867 --> 38:09.967
Regarding security,

38:10.600 --> 38:13.433
Presidential Security Service
and NIS security will be on the front line

38:13.834 --> 38:15.867
and have the police on the second line--

38:15.934 --> 38:18.266
North Koreans are
different from South Koreans,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.266
so complete control is possible.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.200
When President Dae-jung Kim visited us,

38:23.667 --> 38:25.200
every citizen in Pyeongyang

38:25.700 --> 38:28.166
went through a strict inquiry.

38:28.533 --> 38:31.934
There was no risk factors
from the beginning.

38:33.367 --> 38:34.967
However, South Korea is different.

38:36.300 --> 38:37.867
This is the middle of Seoul.

38:39.033 --> 38:39.967
Some may welcome us,

38:40.033 --> 38:42.200
but there will be people against us.

38:44.066 --> 38:45.367
It seems difficult

38:46.233 --> 38:47.667
to control them.

38:48.567 --> 38:55.066
We'll place enough police and security
force around the hotel during the summit.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.467
June 3rd, 1999.

38:59.266 --> 39:00.567
Do you remember that day?

39:00.967 --> 39:02.100
At Gimpo Airport,

39:02.333 --> 39:04.533
a citizen threw eggs at a former president

39:04.600 --> 39:05.967
in South Korea.

39:07.266 --> 39:10.200
If something similar happens
during the summit,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.133
you won't be able to handle
what happens next.

39:32.667 --> 39:33.533
Hey.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.667
What did we steal from the NSS?

39:37.934 --> 39:38.834
I don't know.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.600
Tell me what it is.

39:44.734 --> 39:45.767
I have no idea.

39:46.633 --> 39:47.600
Darn it.

39:47.867 --> 39:49.367
Three of us died already.

39:49.433 --> 39:51.233
How is it possible you don't know?

39:51.300 --> 39:53.300
Complain to Captain,

39:53.633 --> 39:54.467
not me.

39:54.533 --> 39:55.900
Why you bastard...

40:56.033 --> 40:57.233
I won't do anything reckless,

40:57.300 --> 40:58.900
so don't look so nervous.

41:03.033 --> 41:04.567
I thought Seung-hee was dead

41:07.033 --> 41:08.967
because the car Seung-hee was in

41:10.867 --> 41:13.166
exploded in front of my eyes in Hungary.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.200
After seeing it myself,

41:21.834 --> 41:23.600
I couldn't think about anything else.

41:26.367 --> 41:27.934
I just need to do my tasks.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.667
It's a file from San Baek's storage.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.734
Please check what's inside.

41:39.233 --> 41:40.367
Okay.

41:46.033 --> 41:47.934
Do you know what they stole

41:49.166 --> 41:50.700
from the NSS?

43:22.934 --> 43:23.867
What are you doing?

43:23.967 --> 43:25.700
It's nothing.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.900
Play cards with us if you're bored.

43:27.967 --> 43:29.133
I'm fine,

43:29.200 --> 43:30.166
so don't worry about me.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.333
Did you check?

43:47.700 --> 43:48.600
What was it?

43:49.133 --> 43:51.867
It has all the missions he did as Iris.

43:52.967 --> 43:55.467
In all events that influenced
the relationship of North and South,

43:56.033 --> 43:57.033
things were

43:57.100 --> 43:58.333
related to

43:59.734 --> 44:01.066
Iris and San Baek.

44:02.066 --> 44:03.934
When the South developed nuclear weapons,

44:04.166 --> 44:07.567
it said what happened to the nuclear
physicists who were involved.

44:08.233 --> 44:09.367
It also...

44:11.100 --> 44:13.533
included information on your parents.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.633
What do you mean?

44:15.100 --> 44:16.700
Jeong-kuk Kim, Mi-hyun Yun.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.300
Aren't they your parents?

44:21.767 --> 44:23.967
I don't remember anything
about my parents.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.166
When I was sent to
an orphanage around seven

44:29.000 --> 44:31.066
I assumed they died in an accident.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.500
I don't know who they were.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.200
I don't even remember their names.

44:38.867 --> 44:40.200
Tell me, what else?

44:42.533 --> 44:43.867
Both of them

44:44.934 --> 44:46.400
were nuclear physicists who were

44:47.800 --> 44:49.400
involved in the nuclear development.

44:52.333 --> 44:53.367
What's your name?

44:53.433 --> 44:54.300
Hyun-jun Kim.

44:55.033 --> 44:56.266
The one who covered up

44:56.333 --> 44:57.867
their death as a mysterious accident...

45:05.667 --> 45:07.000
was San Baek.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.767
The one who sent you to an orphanage

45:12.266 --> 45:13.367
was San Baek as well.

45:14.667 --> 45:15.767
After that,

45:16.834 --> 45:19.266
he continued to watch you grow up.

46:03.767 --> 46:04.767
Ma'am!

46:06.800 --> 46:07.834
How are you?

46:08.433 --> 46:09.400
I'm good.

46:09.567 --> 46:10.934
You should still get some rest.

46:11.934 --> 46:14.300
-What happened?
-They're still doing the autopsy.

46:14.433 --> 46:17.333
-Did they check the terrorists' faces?
-Of course.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.233
Was there anything in particular?

46:19.567 --> 46:20.600
What do you mean?

46:21.033 --> 46:23.700
I was wondering if they identified them.

46:23.967 --> 46:24.867
No.

46:24.934 --> 46:27.333
Forensic Science Division is stuck too.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.867
The superior officials know
something big happened,

46:30.433 --> 46:32.667
but we don't know what that is yet.

46:39.266 --> 46:40.367
Did you check?

46:40.900 --> 46:41.834
Yes.

46:41.900 --> 46:42.767
What is it?

46:43.734 --> 46:45.233
I'm not sure.

46:45.567 --> 46:47.133
Goodness.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.066
You're so hopeless. Let me see.

47:03.367 --> 47:04.266
Hey.

47:05.667 --> 47:07.000
You're out of the hospital already?

47:07.133 --> 47:08.066
Yes.

47:08.266 --> 47:09.433
Are you busy?

47:10.066 --> 47:11.834
Nothing has been found yet.

47:12.667 --> 47:13.967
Gosh,

47:14.633 --> 47:18.066
they completely eliminated anything
that could be used as proof.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.900
It's actually not surprising,
they were meticulous enough to attack us.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.400
Do you have something to say?

47:28.367 --> 47:29.266
You know,

47:29.333 --> 47:31.567
the program you've mentioned.

47:31.633 --> 47:32.633
Which one?

47:33.834 --> 47:36.600
The program that evaluates
the physique with the outline...

47:37.367 --> 47:38.266
I see.

47:39.133 --> 47:40.367
Well...

47:40.767 --> 47:42.400
Guys, take a break.

47:43.233 --> 47:44.166
-Okay.
-Okay.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.467
Have a seat.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.433
Go on.

47:55.500 --> 47:58.000
Well, you said the image in the webcam

47:58.400 --> 48:01.266
was 74% identical to Hyun-jun.

48:01.333 --> 48:02.367
I did.

48:03.700 --> 48:04.667
Then,

48:05.133 --> 48:07.500
isn't it certain that he was Hyun-jun?

48:08.433 --> 48:09.567
Well...

48:12.367 --> 48:13.967
Please tell me.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.967
Well,

48:16.600 --> 48:17.800
that's...

48:18.533 --> 48:19.700
That day,

48:19.834 --> 48:23.433
Sa-woo completely disagreed,

48:24.467 --> 48:27.300
so I didn't say anything to avoid chaos.

48:28.333 --> 48:29.500
However, the result was...

48:31.400 --> 48:33.967
positive enough to say it was Hyun-jun.

49:07.934 --> 49:09.767
Jeong-in, may I see you?

49:10.367 --> 49:11.333
Okay.

49:17.734 --> 49:20.333
Did you see the terrorists
when you were held hostage?

49:21.133 --> 49:22.200
I did,

49:22.266 --> 49:24.400
but they were wearing masks,
so I didn't see their faces.

49:24.934 --> 49:25.867
Did you...

49:26.867 --> 49:28.633
read the report on the situation

49:29.133 --> 49:30.066
at top secret storeroom?

49:30.133 --> 49:30.967
Yes.

49:31.166 --> 49:33.133
It says one of the terrorists

49:33.567 --> 49:36.166
killed one of his colleagues by accident.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.767
I don't think it was a mistake.

49:39.300 --> 49:41.633
I think he did it to save me.

49:42.166 --> 49:44.000
What are you talking about?

49:44.600 --> 49:45.700
Why would a terrorist do that?

49:45.767 --> 49:47.033
I think

49:48.133 --> 49:49.300
he was Hyun-jun.

49:49.767 --> 49:50.667
What?

49:50.734 --> 49:54.767
The supporting documents on Hyun-jun's
death received from Hungary,

49:54.967 --> 49:56.200
are you sure about those?

49:57.433 --> 49:58.300
Seung-hee.

49:58.934 --> 50:00.166
What's wrong with you?

50:00.233 --> 50:02.200
I know it sounds like nonsense,

50:02.567 --> 50:04.200
but I'd like to ask you one more time.

50:05.300 --> 50:07.033
Check with the Hungarian Intelligence.

50:41.233 --> 50:42.233
We're connected.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.467
How much time do we have?

50:46.667 --> 50:49.133
The time to keep the screen frozen

50:49.200 --> 50:50.333
is 60 seconds maximum.

51:04.533 --> 51:05.433
You can go now.

51:36.633 --> 51:37.800
Once you exit,

51:37.867 --> 51:40.200
you'll find a hotelier-only elevator
in front of you.

53:05.333 --> 53:06.533
Good job, everyone.

53:26.166 --> 53:27.633
During the autopsy,

53:27.867 --> 53:29.700
we couldn't find anything
to help us identify them.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.767
The bodies were clean
without even a single tattoo.

53:32.834 --> 53:33.934
What about their fingerprints?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.066
They weren't any.

53:36.734 --> 53:37.767
What do you mean?

53:37.867 --> 53:39.533
There were no fingerprints on their hands.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.867
Forensic Science Division received
photos of their face, dentition,

53:42.934 --> 53:44.367
and genetic information.

53:44.500 --> 53:46.333
We compared it to the data
from other nations,

53:46.400 --> 53:47.400
but nothing matched.

53:47.834 --> 53:50.200
Did you find anything
from the leftover articles?

53:50.266 --> 53:51.166
It's the same.

53:51.567 --> 53:52.467
Well,

53:52.533 --> 53:55.300
their clothes and possessions
are easy to get anywhere,

53:55.367 --> 53:56.867
so there was nothing special about them.

53:56.967 --> 53:58.667
It's impossible to trace their weapons.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.934
However,

54:01.633 --> 54:05.233
I analyzed the components
of dust found on their bodies.

54:05.433 --> 54:06.767
There was something interesting.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.867
In every person's clothes and shoes,

54:11.166 --> 54:12.934
hydrated silica was found.

54:13.433 --> 54:16.266
I found it strange,
so I analyzed it further.

54:18.700 --> 54:20.333
It was actinolite.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.333
Gosh.

54:23.834 --> 54:25.867
Can you explain so we understand?

54:25.934 --> 54:26.867
It's a type of asbestos.

54:27.133 --> 54:29.100
It's in pure form that isn't processed.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.533
Although

54:31.533 --> 54:34.200
it was found on clothes and shoes,

54:34.467 --> 54:35.633
the autopsy results shows

54:35.700 --> 54:37.433
that it wasn't found

54:37.667 --> 54:39.200
in lungs or other organs.

54:39.667 --> 54:42.400
It means they recently came in contact.

54:43.500 --> 54:45.700
Does that mean

54:45.767 --> 54:48.133
they were in an area where
asbestos was present

54:48.967 --> 54:50.467
after they entered South Korea?

54:50.567 --> 54:51.433
Bravo.

54:52.967 --> 54:54.166
That's very likely.

54:54.333 --> 54:55.834
Asbestos is found anywhere including

54:55.900 --> 54:57.300
construction sites and factories.

54:57.767 --> 54:59.400
We can't narrow things down based on that.

54:59.467 --> 55:00.667
That's not always the case.

55:01.066 --> 55:04.066
Actinolite is a rare type of asbestos.

55:04.467 --> 55:06.066
As it's found to be carcinogenic,

55:06.133 --> 55:08.166
it was banned from use in 2003.

55:08.433 --> 55:10.233
For a small group

55:10.300 --> 55:11.734
to hide and prepare an operation,

55:11.800 --> 55:13.467
they probably obtained a place

55:13.533 --> 55:16.033
that's unnoticeable and
could be used for a period of time.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.567
It's probably

55:17.633 --> 55:20.400
an abandoned factory or storage
where pure actinolite

55:21.166 --> 55:23.100
was kept or processed.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.567
Since they took their chance
to attack the NSS

55:26.633 --> 55:29.166
when the SWAT was busy
with the foreign affairs meeting,

55:29.834 --> 55:31.967
they can't be very far away from here.

55:32.066 --> 55:32.900
So what?

55:32.967 --> 55:36.066
It's possible to find them
if we search a list of abandoned factories

55:37.066 --> 55:38.400
or storage.

55:39.100 --> 55:40.834
Great, get that list now,

55:40.900 --> 55:42.433
check the site and report to me.

55:53.333 --> 55:54.200
Seung-hee.

55:54.934 --> 55:55.967
I want to talk to you.

56:06.767 --> 56:07.734
Did you check?

56:08.433 --> 56:09.333
Yes.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.133
Hungarian Intelligence said

56:12.767 --> 56:14.066
they never sent that document.

56:15.867 --> 56:17.500
Then what happened?

56:17.867 --> 56:19.367
You said you saw it yourself.

56:20.700 --> 56:21.633
Someone

56:22.200 --> 56:23.600
fabricated and entered the information.

56:28.467 --> 56:29.433
Who

56:29.500 --> 56:31.300
would do such a thing?

56:32.200 --> 56:33.433
I don't know.

56:34.166 --> 56:35.166
I can't guess who'd do it.

56:46.700 --> 56:47.600
Can you combine them?

56:47.667 --> 56:48.600
Yes, sir.

56:49.633 --> 56:52.000
I'll order where and when to install it.

56:52.533 --> 56:53.934
Keep it a secret until then.

56:54.000 --> 56:54.900
Okay.

56:56.867 --> 56:57.834
How's Hyun-jun?

57:00.266 --> 57:02.033
He hasn't caused problems yet.

57:02.533 --> 57:04.266
He played an important role

57:05.400 --> 57:06.667
when we infiltrated the NSS.

57:24.667 --> 57:25.667
Go inside.

57:40.834 --> 57:41.800
I heard that

57:42.467 --> 57:45.500
we successfully infiltrated the NSS
thanks to you.

57:45.867 --> 57:47.333
As you cooperated,

57:47.400 --> 57:49.333
I'll keep my promise to you.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.567
Can you tell me
what you stole from the NSS?

57:54.066 --> 57:55.300
It's not that I don't believe you,

57:55.934 --> 57:57.266
but I can't say it.

57:58.033 --> 57:59.200
Soon,

58:00.800 --> 58:02.200
in the middle of Seoul,

58:03.166 --> 58:05.567
something unimaginable will happen.

58:10.467 --> 58:11.934
As I trust you,

58:12.967 --> 58:15.433
I won't control or keep you on watch.

58:16.934 --> 58:18.467
As long as you move with Sun-hwa,

58:19.400 --> 58:20.734
you can do whatever you want.

58:52.500 --> 58:53.967
I heard the detonator

58:54.767 --> 58:56.734
kept in R&D room disappeared.

58:58.033 --> 59:00.367
Doesn't that mean

59:02.266 --> 59:04.533
a nuclear bomb could explode
in the middle of Seoul?

59:05.300 --> 59:06.133
Yes.

59:08.867 --> 59:10.467
They'll do what you and I

59:11.066 --> 59:12.600
have to do.

59:15.400 --> 59:18.133
We must not catch them
before things get started.

59:19.300 --> 59:20.300
You must...

59:20.900 --> 59:22.500
derange the investigation.

59:24.967 --> 59:25.900
Yes, sir.

59:27.333 --> 59:28.300
Come in.

59:34.467 --> 59:35.467
I'd like to talk to you.

59:38.367 --> 59:39.266
Tell me.

59:40.467 --> 59:41.400
I will leave--

59:41.467 --> 59:42.433
No.

59:43.066 --> 59:44.333
You should hear it too.

59:50.600 --> 59:51.967
Hyun-jun Kim is alive.

1:00:26.867 --> 1:00:27.767
Which way is it?

1:00:28.066 --> 1:00:29.300
He must be in the priest's office.

1:00:52.233 --> 1:00:53.166
Father!

1:00:54.533 --> 1:00:55.500
Father!

1:00:59.300 --> 1:01:00.200
Father!

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:02.967
Hyun-jun.

1:01:08.567 --> 1:01:09.500
Father.

1:01:11.467 --> 1:01:12.367
Father.

1:01:12.533 --> 1:01:13.433
Father.

1:01:13.934 --> 1:01:14.800
Father.

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:31.667
NEXT EPISODE

1:02:31.967 --> 1:02:32.800
We must leave now.

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.200
I'm in Korea now.

1:02:39.433 --> 1:02:40.467
Can we meet?

1:02:44.934 --> 1:02:45.867
I think

1:02:45.934 --> 1:02:47.400
Hyun-jun accessed my storage.

1:02:47.734 --> 1:02:50.100
He found out the truth
about his parents' death

1:02:50.266 --> 1:02:52.333
and that I'm part of Iris.

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:56.233
He's having a meeting

1:02:56.633 --> 1:02:57.767
with Mr. Yeon now.

1:02:58.433 --> 1:03:02.400
How far did the event take place
in South Korea?

1:03:03.333 --> 1:03:05.166
-Did you find something?
-Asbestos storage.

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:06.433
It's Seoksu, Anyang.

1:03:06.734 --> 1:03:08.000
Go there with the SWAT.

1:03:08.166 --> 1:03:09.567
Our location has been exposed.
