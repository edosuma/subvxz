01:07.526 --> 01:08.943
Once upon a time,

01:09.027 --> 01:13.698
on the north shore of Long Island,
some 30 miles from New York,

01:13.782 --> 01:17.285
there lived a small girl
on a large estate.

01:17.369 --> 01:21.831
The estate was very large indeed
and had many servants.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.209
There were gardeners
to take care of the gardens

01:25.294 --> 01:27.920
and a tree surgeon on a retainer.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.215
There was a boatman
to take care of the boats,

01:31.300 --> 01:36.053
to put them in the water in the spring
and scrape their bottoms in the winter.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.890
There were specialists
to take care of the grounds,

01:39.975 --> 01:44.270
the outdoor tennis court
and the indoor tennis court,

01:44.646 --> 01:50.401
the outdoor swimming pool
and the indoor swimming pool.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.237
And there was a man
of no particular title

01:53.322 --> 01:56.699
who took care
of the small pool in the garden

01:56.783 --> 01:59.994
for a goldfish named George.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.622
Also on the estate

02:03.707 --> 02:07.126
there was a chauffeur
by the name of Fairchild,

02:07.210 --> 02:10.545
who had been imported
from England years ago

02:10.630 --> 02:13.674
together with a new Rolls-Royce.

02:13.759 --> 02:18.095
Fairchild was a fine chauffeur
of considerable polish,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.098
like the eight cars in his care.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.560
And he had a daughter
by the name of Sabrina.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.691
It was the eve
of the annual 6-meter yacht races,

02:30.776 --> 02:33.110
and, as had been
traditional on Long Island

02:33.195 --> 02:35.237
for the past 30 years,

02:35.322 --> 02:38.115
the Larrabees were giving a party.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.494
It never rained on the night
of the Larrabee party.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.747
The Larrabees
wouldn't have stood for it.

02:44.831 --> 02:50.461
There were four Larrabees in all,
father, mother and two sons.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.424
Maude and Oliver Larrabee
were married in 1906,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.802
and among their
many wedding presents

02:57.886 --> 03:02.640
was the townhouse in New York
and this estate for weekends.

03:02.724 --> 03:07.311
The townhouse has since been
converted into Saks Fifth Avenue.

03:07.938 --> 03:12.566
Linus Larrabee, the elder son,
graduated from Yale,

03:12.651 --> 03:16.278
where his classmates
voted him the man most likely

03:16.363 --> 03:19.156
to leave his alma mater $50 million.

03:19.866 --> 03:25.287
His brother, David, went through
several of the best Eastern colleges

03:25.372 --> 03:27.706
for short periods of time

03:27.791 --> 03:33.212
and through several marriages
for even shorter periods of time.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.674
He is now a successful
six-goal polo player

03:36.758 --> 03:41.679
and is listed on Linus' tax return
as a $600 deduction.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.600
Life was pleasant among the Larrabees,

03:46.685 --> 03:50.729
for this was as close to heaven
as one could get on Long Island.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.938
Come on down from there, Sabrina.
Come on.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.193
You better go to your room
and finish your packing.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.487
- Who's that girl, Father?
- Which girl?

04:39.571 --> 04:41.697
The one dancing with David.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.910
Her name's Van Horn,
Gretchen Van Horn.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.828
Chase National Bank.

04:48.872 --> 04:53.834
- I hate girls that giggle all the time.
- You hate every girl David looks at.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.837
Sabrina, you can't go on like this
about David all your life,

04:56.922 --> 04:59.131
you understand that?
You've got to get over it.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.925
Yes, Father.

05:01.009 --> 05:05.304
It's good you're going away.
I only hope it's far enough.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.848
- Yes, Father.
- Come along, Sabrina.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.561
In a minute, Father. You go ahead.
I'll be up soon.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.211
- It's you, Sabrina.
- Hello, David.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.463
I thought I heard somebody.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.135
No. It's nobody.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.575
Gretchen! Yoo-hoo! Tennis, anyone?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.077
Gretchen?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.334
What do we call this, mixed singles?

07:02.255 --> 07:06.258
Oh, no, no, no. Whatever you do,
you have to stay on your side of the net.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.761
That'll be a little difficult, Gretchen.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.181
Now, David,
you know the rules of the game.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.932
Okay, I'll serve.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.612
Sabrina.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.288
Yes, Father?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.290
You won't forget
your passport in the morning?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.624
No, Father.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.378
You know, it's not every girl
that's lucky enough to go to Paris.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.546
I know.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.966
And it's the best cooking school
in the world, Sabrina.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.217
If your mother were alive,

09:12.302 --> 09:14.803
she'd be very happy to know
that you were going there.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.639
After all, she was the best cook
on Long Island.

09:19.434 --> 09:22.644
I'm not telling you that
you have to be a cook as she was

09:22.729 --> 09:25.481
or that I want you
to marry a chauffeur like me,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.983
but you know how I feel about it.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.402
Your mother and I
had a good life together.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.654
We were respected by everyone.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.492
That's as much as anyone can want
in this world.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.452
Don't reach for the moon, child.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.582
No, Father.

09:43.666 --> 09:48.003
Besides, it never hurt a young girl
to learn how to cook, did it, Sabrina?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.590
I'll wake you at 7:00.
The boat goes at noon.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.593
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.813
What's going on here?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.775
Fairchild! Fairchild!

15:45.361 --> 15:46.945
Anybody here?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.353
Who's that?

16:30.198 --> 16:34.159
Sabrina, come out of there.
Come on. Come on out of there.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.581
Hello.

16:39.707 --> 16:44.502
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking the spark plugs.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.004
What?

16:46.088 --> 16:49.841
Father was worried 'cause one
of the spark plugs was missing.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.260
I wanted to find out which one it was.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.263
So you started all the motors
and closed all the doors?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.765
I didn't want to disturb anyone.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.683
You might never have
disturbed anyone again.

16:58.768 --> 17:03.355
- Does your father know about this?
- No! I wanted to surprise him.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.273
You'd better get out of here.

17:08.236 --> 17:13.615
Here, now. Now, breathe deep.
That's right. Now deeper.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.133
- What happened?
- You passed out.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.641
I'm all right. You don't have to carry me.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.227
Of all the idiotic things.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.729
Haven't you ever heard
of carbon monoxide?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.439
It kills people.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.733
- It does?
- Certainly.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.236
What do you suppose would have
happened if I hadn't come along?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.154
- I'd have died.
- And fast.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.490
Eight cars! One would've done it.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.076
It's a good thing Mrs. Van Horn
asked me to drive her home.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.620
Mrs. Van Horn? Gretchen's mother?

18:01.664 --> 18:05.125
- Why doesn't she drive her home?
- Because we can't find Gretchen.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.876
- She...
- She what?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.546
Nothing.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.257
All right. The next time you start a car,

18:12.341 --> 18:15.969
make sure you leave the garage
doors open, you understand?

18:16.053 --> 18:19.597
You'd think a chauffeur's daughter
would know better.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.016
Yes, sir.

18:44.373 --> 18:48.710
Yesterday we have learned
the correct way how to boil water.

18:48.836 --> 18:53.590
Today we will learn the correct way
how to crack an egg.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.009
Voilà. An egg.

18:56.093 --> 19:00.555
Now, an egg is not a stone.
It is not made of wood.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.516
It is a living thing. It has a heart.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.686
So when we crack it,
we must not torment it.

19:06.771 --> 19:10.023
We must be merciful
and execute it quickly,

19:10.107 --> 19:12.400
like with the guillotine.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.071
It is done with one hand.
Kindly watch the wrist.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.575
Voilà. One, two, three, crack!

19:22.953 --> 19:26.539
You see? It is all in the wrist.

19:26.624 --> 19:33.004
And now, everybody, take an egg.
One, two, three, crack!

19:33.089 --> 19:46.267
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

19:46.394 --> 19:48.645
Take an egg. Crack!

19:53.734 --> 19:58.613
The wrist. Like a whip. You watch.
One, two, three, crack!

19:59.281 --> 20:07.414
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

20:07.498 --> 20:09.082
New egg. One, two...

20:11.127 --> 20:14.879
"Dear Father,
or cherpapa, as we say over here,

20:14.964 --> 20:17.006
"isn't my French getting good?

20:17.133 --> 20:20.009
"Well, we finally finished
our four-week course in sauces,

20:20.136 --> 20:21.386
"and thank goodness.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.181
"I thought soups were tough,
but sauces just about killed me.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.893
"I almost flunked my hollandaise.
It kept separating on me."

20:28.978 --> 20:32.897
Too much vinegar.
Does she mention David?

20:32.982 --> 20:35.483
It's Mr. Linus, Tom.
He's ready to go into town.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.403
What about David?
What does she say about David?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.238
- Not a word.
- That's good.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.407
Wait a minute. Here's something.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.742
"I didn't think of David
very much any more."

20:44.827 --> 20:46.077
That's good.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.037
- "Except at night."
- That's bad.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.458
"I decided to be sensible the other day
and tore up David's picture."

20:51.542 --> 20:52.625
That's good.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.086
"Could you please air-mail me
some Scotch tape?"

20:55.171 --> 20:56.629
That's bad.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.179
- Good morning, Fairchild.
- Good morning, sir.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.222
A beautiful day, sir.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.642
All right, take the parkway,
two windows open, 35 miles an hour.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.060
Yes, sir.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.492
- Morning, Linus. Where are you off to?
- The office. Where do you think?

21:25.576 --> 21:28.786
- The office? On Sunday?
- Today is Wednesday.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.205
Wednesday?

21:36.086 --> 21:41.674
This is KL-75263.
Get me Bowling Green-91099.

21:43.385 --> 21:47.055
Good morning, Miss McCardle.
How did the market open?

21:47.181 --> 21:51.226
Industrials, 247.63, up $1.10.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.979
Rails, 94.7, up 58 cents.

21:55.064 --> 22:00.276
Utilities, 47.23, off 11 cents.
I'm just leaving the house.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.071
You can put the coffee on
in 45 minutes.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.538
Interoffice memo,
Linus Larrabee to David Larrabee.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.997
Dear David, this is to remind you

22:13.082 --> 22:15.708
that you're a junior partner
of Larrabee Industries.

22:15.793 --> 22:19.337
Our building is located
at 30 Broad Street, New York City.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.548
Your office is on the 22nd Floor.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.509
Our normal week
is Monday through Friday.

22:24.593 --> 22:28.846
Our working day is 9:00 to 5:00.
Should you find this inconvenient,

22:28.931 --> 22:31.307
you're free to retire under
the Larrabee Pension Plan.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.600
Having been with us one year,

22:32.726 --> 22:36.896
this will entitle you to 65 cents a month
for the rest of your life.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.363
What do you hear
from your daughter, Fairchild?

22:45.447 --> 22:48.449
- She still loves him.
- I beg your pardon?

22:48.576 --> 22:51.578
I mean,
she loves the cooking school, sir.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.748
But she'll get over it.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.717
And now, mesdames et messieurs,
soon we will see

23:05.801 --> 23:09.095
how you have learned
the lesson of the soufflé.

23:10.306 --> 23:14.809
The soufflé, it must be gay. Gay,

23:14.935 --> 23:20.982
like two butterflies dancing the waltz
in the summer breeze.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.111
Very well.

23:25.195 --> 23:30.533
You have five seconds,
four seconds, three seconds,

23:30.659 --> 23:34.370
two seconds, one second!

23:34.496 --> 23:35.955
To the ovens!

23:47.676 --> 23:48.968
Too low.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.220
Too pale.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.057
Too heavy.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.809
Too low.

23:56.894 --> 24:00.229
Too high. You are exaggerating.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.481
Fair.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.524
So-so.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.401
Sloppy.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.364
Superb!

24:09.490 --> 24:12.992
My dear Baron,
you have not lost your touch.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.663
Much too low.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.378
- I didn't know what happened.
- I will tell you what happened.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.755
You forgot to turn on the oven.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.634
I've been watching you for a long time,
mademoiselle.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.763
Your mind has not been on the cooking.
Your mind has been elsewhere.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.972
You're in love.

24:35.057 --> 24:39.977
And I will venture to go a step further,
you are unhappily in love.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.480
- Does it show?
- Very clearly.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.317
A woman happily in love,
she burns the soufflé.

24:46.402 --> 24:50.947
A woman unhappily in love,
she forgets to turn on the oven.

24:51.907 --> 24:55.159
- Am I correct?
- Yes.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.579
- But I'm trying to get over it.
- Why try to get over it?

24:58.706 --> 25:01.624
You speak of love
like it was a bad cough.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.003
He doesn't even know I exist.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.005
I might as well
be reaching for the moon.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.757
The moon?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.387
You young people,
you are so old-fashioned.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.805
Have you not heard?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.891
We are building rockets
to reach the moon.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.398
To begin with,
you must stop looking like a horse.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.607
Horse?

25:31.280 --> 25:34.574
"His name is the Baron St. Fontanel."

25:34.658 --> 25:36.075
Baron?

25:36.160 --> 25:40.037
"He came to the cooking school
to take a refresher course in soufflés

25:40.122 --> 25:43.791
"and liked me so much
he decided to stay on for the fish."

25:43.917 --> 25:46.210
What about David?
What does she say about David?

25:46.295 --> 25:48.379
David? She's got a baron.

25:48.464 --> 25:55.094
"The baron is 74 years old
and very sweet and very wise.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.764
"He has a box at the opera,
a racing stable,

25:57.848 --> 26:00.600
"wonderful paintings
and his own vineyards.

26:00.684 --> 26:05.480
"Tomorrow night he is taking me
to a very fashionable charity ball,

26:05.606 --> 26:08.775
"and I have an evening dress
just for the occasion.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.277
"If David could only see me in it,

26:11.361 --> 26:14.280
"yards of skirt
and way off the shoulders."

26:15.324 --> 26:17.533
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.578
- What's going on here?
- A letter from Sabrina, sir.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.165
Wouldn't you like to read it, Mr. David?
There's something about you in it.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.805
- Poor Sabrina.
- What's the matter with him anyway?

26:38.889 --> 26:41.682
He's getting married again,
that's what's the matter with him.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.143
- He is?
- Number four.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.313
- Who says so?
- Cholly Knickerbocker.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.483
Don't you people
ever read the society columns?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.439
Is he in? Is my brother in?

27:30.566 --> 27:32.149
Yes, he is, Mr. David,
but he's very busy.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.526
I want to see him.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.362
- Well, how about 3:30 this afternoon?
- I want to see him now!

27:36.446 --> 27:38.531
I'm sorry, Mr. David. I have my orders.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.491
He's working with the lawyers
on the plastics deal.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.285
Miss McCardle,
are you gonna press that button,

27:42.411 --> 27:44.620
or do I have to take you up in my arms
and break that door down

27:44.746 --> 27:45.830
using you as a battering ram?

27:45.914 --> 27:48.249
- Mr. David!
- Make up your mind.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.630
Linus, I want to talk to you.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.635
Ask Miss McCardle for an appointment.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.220
Don't give me that
appointment business.

28:01.305 --> 28:06.309
- I'm mad! I'm really steamed!
- All right, gentlemen, I'll be 10 minutes.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.479
Now, what's the trouble?

28:11.607 --> 28:14.233
- How did this get in the paper?
- What?

28:14.318 --> 28:16.235
"It looks like wedding bells
for David Larrabee again.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.863
"The girl is Elizabeth Tyson
of the Oyster Bay Tysons."

28:18.947 --> 28:21.949
- Congratulations.
- Did you plant this?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.619
Me? I thought it was
common knowledge

28:24.745 --> 28:26.287
about you and Elizabeth Tyson.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.581
- You like her, don't you?
- I like her a lot.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.083
- Well?
- I like a lot of girls a lot.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.668
You can say that again.

28:32.794 --> 28:38.132
What are you going to do with that gun?
Put that thing away, Linus.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.801
Look at that.
Greatest plastic ever made.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.595
Not a scratch on it.

28:42.679 --> 28:46.974
Say, I wonder how this would stand up
against a bazooka.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.810
Miss McCardle, get General Stanton
on Governors Island

28:49.937 --> 28:52.855
- and ask if we can borrow a bazooka.
- Yes, Mr. Larrabee.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.774
To get back to my problem,
if you don't mind.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.193
- Lend me your lighter.
- Get this straight, Linus.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.321
I have no intention
of marrying Elizabeth Tyson.

29:00.447 --> 29:04.992
Doesn't burn. Doesn't scorch.
Doesn't melt. How about that?

29:05.118 --> 29:08.412
Look, Linus, I've been married before.
I've had it. I've had it three times.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.039
But this is the first time
the family approves,

29:10.165 --> 29:11.415
because for once
you're gonna settle down

29:11.500 --> 29:13.626
and do something constructive. Taste it.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.962
What's so constructive
about marrying Elizabeth Tyson?

29:16.046 --> 29:17.338
Taste it.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.008
- It's sweet.
- That's right. It's made of sugar cane.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.510
Sugar cane.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.806
Wait a minute. This wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact

29:26.890 --> 29:27.974
that the Tysons own

29:28.058 --> 29:31.519
the largest holdings
of sugar cane in Puerto Rico, would it?

29:31.603 --> 29:34.522
Second-largest.
The largest have no daughter.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.526
It's all beginning to make sense.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.488
Mr. Tyson owns the sugar cane,
you own the formula for the plastics,

29:42.572 --> 29:45.032
and I'm supposed to be offered up
as a human sacrifice

29:45.117 --> 29:47.743
on the altar of industrial progress,
is that it?

29:47.869 --> 29:51.330
You make it sound so vulgar, David.
As if the son of the hot dog dynasty

29:51.415 --> 29:54.500
were being offered in marriage
to the daughter of the mustard king.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.335
Surely you don't object to Elizabeth

29:56.420 --> 29:58.546
just because her father
happens to have $20 million.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.048
That's very
narrow-minded of you, David.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.633
Just one thing you overlooked.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.844
I haven't proposed,
and she hasn't accepted.

30:04.928 --> 30:08.055
Don't worry. I proposed
and Mr. Tyson accepted.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.683
- Did you kiss him?
- Now, look, David.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.477
Elizabeth is one of
the loveliest girls around.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.438
Sooner or later
you're going to propose to her anyway.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.023
I'm only trying to help you
make up your mind.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.151
- Then why don't you marry her?
- Me?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.236
What's so funny?
You want to die an old maid?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.488
I was just thinking
that if I were ever to get married,

30:24.573 --> 30:26.615
I'd have to take a Dictaphone,
two secretaries

30:26.742 --> 30:30.286
and four corporation counselors
along on the honeymoon.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.205
I'd be unfaithful to my wife
every night of my married life

30:33.290 --> 30:38.002
with vice presidents, boards
of directors, slide-rule accountants.

30:38.086 --> 30:42.298
This is my home.
No wife would ever understand it.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.717
Well, neither can I.
You've got all the money in the world.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.302
What's money got to do with it?

30:46.428 --> 30:48.137
If making money
were all there was to business,

30:48.263 --> 30:49.722
it'd hardly be worthwhile
going to the office.

30:49.806 --> 30:50.848
Money is the by-product.

30:50.932 --> 30:55.770
- What's the main objective, power?
- That's become a dirty word.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.314
Well, then, what's the urge?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.400
You're going into plastics now.
What will that prove?

31:01.485 --> 31:04.153
Prove? Nothing much.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.073
A new product has been found,
something of use to the world,

31:07.157 --> 31:10.326
and so a new industry
moves into an undeveloped area.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.203
Factories go up,
machines are brought in,

31:12.287 --> 31:13.746
a harbor is dug,
and you're in business.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.247
It's purely coincidental, of course,

31:15.332 --> 31:18.125
that people who never saw
a dime before suddenly have a dollar

31:18.210 --> 31:20.669
and barefooted kids wear shoes
and have their teeth fixed

31:20.796 --> 31:23.881
and their faces washed.
What's wrong with the kind of an urge

31:23.965 --> 31:27.343
that gives people libraries,
hospitals, baseball diamonds

31:27.469 --> 31:29.929
and movies on a Saturday night?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.555
Miss McCardle,
will you send in the secretaries?

31:31.640 --> 31:32.723
Yes, Mr. Larrabee.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.518
Now you make me feel like a heel.
If I don't marry Elizabeth,

31:35.644 --> 31:37.686
some kid's going to be
running around Puerto Rico barefoot

31:37.813 --> 31:40.689
- with cavities in his teeth.
- Look at this stuff.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.109
You'll fly in a plane made of it,
you'll wear a suit made of it,

31:43.193 --> 31:46.362
and before we're through with it,
you'll probably be able to eat it.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.155
We're organizing Larrabee Plastics.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.533
Larrabee Construction
is ready with the blueprints.

31:50.659 --> 31:54.453
Larrabee Shipping has bought nine
more freighters to handle the traffic.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.288
You mean
the wheels are in motion already?

31:56.373 --> 31:58.290
That's exactly what I mean.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.336
Would you mind demonstrating
the weight test to Mr. David, please?

32:02.420 --> 32:05.381
- Linus, I'll take your word for it.
- Up you go.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.634
- Now, wait a minute.
- I want you to see how resilient it is.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.678
Bounce, please, ladies.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.934
Some plastic, eh?
We're planning on a summer wedding

32:17.018 --> 32:19.728
so we can get in
on this year's sugar crop.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.021
Yeah.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.401
I think you're going to be
very happy, David.

32:33.034 --> 32:37.037
Dearest Father,
we shall be graduating next week,

32:37.122 --> 32:41.667
and I shall be getting my diploma.
I want to thank you now

32:41.751 --> 32:45.254
for the two most
wonderful years of my life.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.215
I shall always love you
for sending me here.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.789
It is late at night,

33:20.916 --> 33:24.251
and someone across the way
is playing La Vie en Rose.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.671
It is the French way of saying,

33:27.756 --> 33:32.009
"I am looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses,"

33:32.093 --> 33:34.595
and it says everything I feel.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.892
I have learned so many things, Father,

33:39.976 --> 33:44.605
not just how to make vichyssoise
or calf's head with sauce vinaigrette,

33:45.774 --> 33:48.275
but a much more important recipe.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.613
I have learned how to live,

33:53.949 --> 33:57.660
how to be in the world and of the world,

33:58.954 --> 34:01.789
and not just to stand aside and watch.

34:03.625 --> 34:07.044
And I will never, never again
run away from life

34:08.463 --> 34:10.380
or from love, either.

34:12.634 --> 34:16.594
I am taking the plane home
on Friday, Father.

34:16.679 --> 34:21.641
You needn't pick me up at the airport.
I'll just take the Long Island railroad,

34:21.726 --> 34:25.813
and you can meet me at the train,
the 4:15.

34:28.149 --> 34:32.110
If you should have any difficulty
recognizing your daughter,

34:32.195 --> 34:37.074
I shall be the most sophisticated woman
at the Glen Cove Station.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.045
Taxi, miss?
Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.

35:31.129 --> 35:35.424
- Well, hello. How are you?
- Well, I'm fine. How are you?

35:35.550 --> 35:38.177
And, I might add, who are you?

35:38.261 --> 35:40.888
- Who am I?
- Am I supposed to know?

35:42.766 --> 35:44.683
Come to think of it,
no, you're not supposed to know.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.477
Are you stranded?

35:46.561 --> 35:49.355
My father was supposed to pick me up,
but something must've happened.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.023
Whoever your father is
and whatever happened,

35:51.107 --> 35:54.151
I'll be eternally grateful,
that is if I can give you a lift.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.362
You certainly can.
You can drive me home.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.447
Good. I'll get your bags.

36:00.617 --> 36:03.911
- Where do you live?
- Dosoris Lane.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.373
Dosoris Lane? Say, that's where I live.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.957
- Really?
- Sure.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.084
We must be neighbors.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.170
And if there's one thing I believe in,
it's love thy neighbor.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.922
So do I.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.925
Come on, David.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.678
- David? Is his name David?
- Yes, it is.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.264
That's funny. My name's David, too.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.476
That is funny, isn't it?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.858
Are you sure
you don't want to tell me your name?

36:34.943 --> 36:38.195
Positive. I'm having much too much fun.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.073
All right, if you want to play games,

36:41.157 --> 36:43.283
have you always
lived here in Long Island?

36:43.368 --> 36:44.993
Most of my life.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.871
I could've sworn I knew
every pretty girl on the North Shore.

36:47.956 --> 36:51.792
I could've sworn
you took in more territory than that.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.837
This is maddening.
I know I've seen that face before.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.214
Let me see your profile again.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.092
I know I know you.

37:00.176 --> 37:04.471
I have a feeling I've seen you
with your father.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.974
Wait a minute.
Is your father Admiral Starratt?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.308
Hardly.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.895
It's funny.
I keep seeing him in a uniform.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.732
Come on, give us a hint.
What does your father do?

37:15.817 --> 37:18.652
- He's in transportation.
- Transportation?

37:19.654 --> 37:21.697
- Railroads. New York Central.
- No.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.866
- Planes. TWA.
- No.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.493
- Boats. United States Lines.
- No.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.496
- I pass.
- Automobiles.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.584
Chrysler.

37:33.668 --> 37:38.672
Yes, Chrysler and Ford
and General Motors and Rolls-Royce.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.967
Is your father on the board of directors
of all those companies?

37:42.051 --> 37:45.137
Well, you might say he runs things.

37:45.221 --> 37:49.224
- I bet my brother Linus knows him.
- He certainly does.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.311
As a matter of fact,
they quite often drive into town together.

37:52.395 --> 37:56.982
- They do?
- Straight through to the garage, please.

37:57.066 --> 38:02.112
- I feel so stupid, I could kill myself.
- You'll be all right in a minute.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.999
Here we are.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.542
Now, look,
I'm not just pulling that old line

38:15.627 --> 38:18.545
of, "Haven't we met somewhere
before?" We have met...

38:20.465 --> 38:22.174
- You don't live here.
- Yes, I do.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.427
- I live here.
- Hi, neighbor.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.060
Sabrina!

38:33.144 --> 38:35.562
Sabrina. Oh, Brina, Brina.

38:35.647 --> 38:39.066
Hello, Margaret.
It's so good to be home.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.817
Look at you. You're such a lady.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.862
You've come home
such a beautiful lady.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.532
- Oh, and Charles!
- Welcome home, Sabrina.

38:46.616 --> 38:50.077
Ernest, Jenny, how are you?

38:50.161 --> 38:53.247
Don't cry, Margaret.
It's nothing to cry about.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.706
I bought you a hat, Margaret.

38:54.791 --> 38:58.585
A real Paris hat
for you to wear to church on Sundays.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.255
And, Jenny, I've got something for you.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.511
Father!

39:11.933 --> 39:13.600
I'm sorry I missed you, Sabrina,

39:13.685 --> 39:15.602
but I had to take
Mrs. Larrabee to the hairdresser.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.689
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.568
Well, I wouldn't have
recognized you anyway.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.946
Well, David had a little trouble,
didn't you, David?

39:26.948 --> 39:28.740
Yes. Yes, I did.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.577
I'll put some coffee on.
Will you come to the kitchen, Sabrina?

39:31.661 --> 39:33.453
As soon as
I've opened my bags, Margaret.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.957
Let's get them out of the car,
and I'll take them upstairs.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.709
Look, as old neighbors,

39:38.793 --> 39:41.003
I think the two of us
should have a reunion.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.005
- It's only fair.
- How about tonight?

39:43.131 --> 39:45.090
- Do you really want to see me?
- Very much.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.634
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.970
- All right.
- Good. We'll go out on the town.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.180
We'll drive to New York,
have a quick drink at the Stork,

39:52.307 --> 39:53.765
then go somewhere for dinner.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.351
I know a wonderful little
French restaurant over on First Avenue.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.856
I guess you wouldn't
think so much of it after Paris.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.817
- I'll love it.
- Then we'll go dancing someplace,

40:03.901 --> 40:05.902
and when they
throw us out of El Morocco,

40:05.987 --> 40:07.863
we'll mosey on down to the Village.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.323
- You like Dixieland bands?
- Yes.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.491
I know the greatest. It's...

40:12.493 --> 40:14.620
Wait a minute. I completely forgot.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.496
We're having a big party
at the house here tonight.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.415
- With an orchestra and dancing?
- Yes.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.417
But that'll be even more fun.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.545
I didn't know. A lot of dull people around.
Family stuff, you know.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.673
Well, I don't mind, David,
as long as you're there.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.176
- Sabrina.
- In a minute, Father.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.346
And I have a lovely evening dress with
yards of skirt and way off the shoulder.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.723
- Shall I wear it?
- Why, yes, of course.

40:34.849 --> 40:38.018
David, this couldn't be nicer.
A homecoming party.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.356
I'll get the dress out and press it.
See you tonight.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.616
Hello, Linus. I'm back.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.211
It's Sabrina. Isn't it amazing?
Would you have recognized her,

41:04.295 --> 41:06.296
that scrawny little kid
who used to whip around corners

41:06.381 --> 41:07.547
every time she saw us coming,

41:07.632 --> 41:10.425
her knees always painted
with Mercurochrome?

41:10.510 --> 41:12.636
- How do you like those legs now?
- David.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.930
- Aren't they something?
- David!

41:16.015 --> 41:17.516
The last pair of legs
that were something

41:17.600 --> 41:20.435
cost the family $25,000.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.896
Wait till you see
what I brought you from Paris.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.108
Sabrina, I know I should have
mentioned it in my last letter...

41:26.192 --> 41:29.236
- Here we are. Do you like it?
- ...but I didn't want to upset you.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.446
And here. Aren't they gaudy?

41:32.573 --> 41:36.743
Sabrina, David is engaged.
He's getting married again.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.871
I know. Margaret wrote me.
Real Napoleon brandy.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.040
And this is for you
to wear on your day off.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.458
Then you don't care?

41:43.543 --> 41:46.920
Not too much.
After all, he's not married yet.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.423
I didn't like that.
I didn't like the sound of it.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.675
But don't you see, Father?
Everything has changed.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.093
Nothing has changed.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.930
He's still David Larrabee,
and you're still the chauffeur's daughter,

41:57.014 --> 42:00.183
and you're still reaching for the moon.

42:00.268 --> 42:04.354
No, Father.
The moon's reaching for me.

42:34.761 --> 42:37.888
I wish the wedding
were tomorrow, David.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.890
- Don't you?
- Yes, dear.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.145
Ten more days.
It'll seem more like 10 years.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.647
Yes, dear.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.232
Father planned for us to fly to Honolulu

42:49.317 --> 42:52.277
right after the reception,
but I said definitely not.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.821
I certainly don't want to spend
the first 18 hours of my honeymoon

42:54.906 --> 42:57.532
in a plane, sitting up. Do you?

42:57.617 --> 42:59.701
- Yes, dear.
- David!

42:59.786 --> 43:02.621
What? I mean no.
I mean, what did you say?

43:02.705 --> 43:05.916
- Darling, aren't you interested?
- Of course, dear.

43:10.546 --> 43:14.758
- Aren't they a sweet couple?
- Charming. Elizabeth's a lovely girl.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.761
I wish young men would stop wearing
white jackets in the evening.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.721
They look like barbers.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.974
- Now, Oliver.
- My throat's dry.

43:23.059 --> 43:24.142
Have you been smoking?

43:24.227 --> 43:26.603
Maude, I stopped smoking
three months ago.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.439
I find it rather sad
that after 48 years of marriage

43:29.524 --> 43:31.900
distrust should
creep into our relationship.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.402
I'll join the men in the library.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.168
David.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.588
I think I ought to have
a talk with your chauffeur.

43:53.673 --> 43:56.716
- Our chauffeur? What for?
- Well, Father wants to give me

43:56.801 --> 43:58.385
either a Bentley
or a Mercedes as a present,

43:58.469 --> 44:00.178
and I thought your chauffeur
would be able to tell me...

44:00.263 --> 44:02.264
Sure. Sure. Of course.

44:02.348 --> 44:07.143
- What's his name?
- Sabrina. I mean, Fairchild.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.854
I'll talk to him, Elizabeth. Don't bother.

44:08.938 --> 44:12.566
All right, darling.
I know you'll take care of everything.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.265
What is it, David?

44:45.349 --> 44:47.809
Would you like to go
and get something to eat?

44:47.894 --> 44:48.935
No, thank you, darling.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.396
- A drink?
- No.

44:59.447 --> 45:04.117
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it's my fault. I didn't see you.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.161
- Will it wash out, Elizabeth?
- Yes. It isn't bad.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.038
Well, you'd better go
and do it right now, huh?

45:08.122 --> 45:11.166
- Come on, Elizabeth, I'll help you.
- All right.

45:17.924 --> 45:19.174
Sabrina.

45:19.842 --> 45:21.009
David.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.350
- Hello.
- You look wonderful.

45:28.434 --> 45:31.311
- Thank you. I'm a bit late.
- I worried.

45:31.395 --> 45:33.313
Were you afraid
I'd forgotten the address?

45:33.397 --> 45:35.106
It crossed my mind.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.776
- Shall we dance?
- Right here?

46:05.554 --> 46:08.348
- Who is that girl?
- I didn't know.

46:08.432 --> 46:10.976
I wonder what happened to Elizabeth.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.067
- What a lovely party.
- It is now.

46:19.151 --> 46:23.363
The nicest one you've ever had,
and I've been to all your parties.

46:23.447 --> 46:27.325
- You have?
- Standing right up there in that tree.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.912
Sabrina, if I'd only known.

46:48.514 --> 46:52.767
Sabrina, Sabrina,
where have you been all my life?

46:52.893 --> 46:58.106
- Right over the garage.
- Right over my car. Right up in that tree.

46:59.108 --> 47:00.775
What a fool I was.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.446
And what a crush I had on you.

47:05.114 --> 47:07.115
It's not too late, is it?

47:07.867 --> 47:10.035
I didn't know, David. Is it?

47:25.968 --> 47:28.803
You should see her!
You should see Sabrina!

47:28.888 --> 47:33.641
The prettiest girl, the prettiest dress,
the best dancer, the belle of the ball.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.269
And such poise,
as though she belonged up there.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.480
- I didn't like it.
- Who's she dancing with, David?

47:38.564 --> 47:40.982
That's right.
And he's holding her so close,

47:41.067 --> 47:43.234
I didn't see
how the poor girl can breathe.

47:43.319 --> 47:46.654
And the way they look
into each other's eyes...

47:46.739 --> 47:47.864
I didn't like it.

47:47.948 --> 47:50.575
Tom, you ought to be happy for her.

47:50.659 --> 47:52.994
This is what she wanted.
This is where she belongs.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.497
No, it's not, and it's not where I belong.

47:55.581 --> 47:57.791
Remember the chauffeur
on the Harrington estate?

47:57.875 --> 47:59.876
His daughter fell in love
with the son of the house,

47:59.960 --> 48:02.879
and the first thing he knew
he was driving the family to the church,

48:02.963 --> 48:05.840
changing his uniform, and walking
down the aisle to give the bride away.

48:05.925 --> 48:09.844
- That's not for me. I don't like it.
- Tom, that was 25 years ago.

48:09.929 --> 48:12.472
Come on, let's sneak up and see her.

48:36.705 --> 48:40.375
David.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.545
Hello, Mother.

48:43.629 --> 48:45.713
David, I don't believe
I know this young lady.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.341
- Yes, you do.
- Good evening, Mrs. Larrabee.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.260
Mother, this is Miss Fairchild.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.428
- Sabrina?
- Yes, of course.

48:53.389 --> 48:57.642
- Yes, of course!
- Of course. Sabrina.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.435
You didn't recognize me, did you?

48:59.520 --> 49:01.729
Have I changed? Have I really changed?

49:01.814 --> 49:03.648
You certainly have.

49:03.732 --> 49:06.442
- You look lovely, Sabrina.
- Doesn't she, though?

49:06.527 --> 49:08.236
I thought it would be fun
to ask her to the party,

49:08.320 --> 49:10.113
you know, kind of a welcome home.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.031
Well, David's been just wonderful,
Mrs. Larrabee.

49:12.116 --> 49:15.660
- He met me at the station.
- Did he? How nice of him.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.913
- Yes. She's been to Paris, you know.
- Yes, I know.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.290
You must come over sometime

49:20.374 --> 49:22.750
and cook something
very special for us, Sabrina.

49:22.835 --> 49:26.504
- I want to see what you've learned.
- I've learned a lot.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.592
Bye.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.811
David, this is such fun.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.188
So much more fun
than just watching from that tree.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.148
I'm so glad
you came back home, Sabrina.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.733
I'll never let you go away again.

51:10.818 --> 51:12.986
- Never?
- Never.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.947
David, would you like to kiss me?

51:16.031 --> 51:20.368
- Would I?
- Yes. A nice steady kiss.

51:20.452 --> 51:23.663
- Not on roller skates this time.
- Roller skates?

51:23.747 --> 51:25.248
You don't remember.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.417
Well, I remember
I had a pair of roller skates.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.336
I was 9 years old,
and you had your arms around me

51:30.421 --> 51:32.964
because you were teaching me
to skate backwards,

51:33.048 --> 51:36.634
and suddenly you kissed me.
I've never forgotten.

51:38.804 --> 51:42.098
- Sabrina, let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's.

51:42.182 --> 51:45.685
I'll tell you what. You slip away first,
and then I'll meet you at...

51:45.769 --> 51:47.270
- The indoor tennis court.
- Yes.

51:47.354 --> 51:50.106
- And you'll bring champagne.
- Of course.

51:54.111 --> 51:57.405
You saw an awful lot from that tree,
didn't you?

51:57.489 --> 52:00.950
And will you have the orchestra play
Isn't It Romantic?

52:01.035 --> 52:02.327
Naturally.

52:32.816 --> 52:33.900
What's happened to David?

52:33.984 --> 52:38.071
He's being a good host,
but I'll get him out of circulation.

52:38.155 --> 52:39.489
Thank you.

52:50.626 --> 52:52.752
Have you got a minute, David?

52:52.836 --> 52:55.463
- Not right now.
- The old man wants to see you.

52:55.547 --> 52:57.048
- Later. I'm busy.
- You better come along.

52:57.132 --> 52:58.257
He's frothing at the mouth.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.510
- What about?
- You guess.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.846
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Definitely animal.

53:16.193 --> 53:19.737
I'm telling you, Linus, this boy
should be drummed out of the family!

53:19.822 --> 53:21.489
What have I done now, Father?

53:21.573 --> 53:24.200
I'm not saying
that all Larrabees have been saints.

53:24.284 --> 53:26.119
There was a Thomas Larrabee
who was hung for piracy,

53:26.203 --> 53:28.371
and there was a Benjamin Larrabee
who was a slave trader,

53:28.455 --> 53:30.373
and it was my great-great-uncle
Joshua Larrabee

53:30.457 --> 53:33.084
who was shot in Indiana
while attempting to rob a train.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.293
But there never was a Larrabee

53:34.378 --> 53:36.838
who behaved as David Larrabee
has behaved here tonight!

53:36.922 --> 53:39.674
- Exactly what have I done?
- What have you done?

53:39.758 --> 53:41.884
Father, remember
your basal metabolism.

53:41.969 --> 53:44.554
No gentleman makes love to a servant
in his mother's house.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.223
- She is not a servant.
- She's a servant's daughter.

53:47.307 --> 53:48.349
And in behaving as you have

53:48.434 --> 53:51.144
you've embarrassed not only
your mother, but also our chauffeur.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.439
I've too much respect for Fairchild
ever to intrude on his personal life,

53:54.523 --> 53:56.774
and I expect you to have
the same respect for his daughter.

53:56.859 --> 53:59.735
I have so much respect for his daughter
I invited her to the party!

53:59.820 --> 54:02.738
- That's overdoing it.
- I love her!

54:02.823 --> 54:04.240
He loves her.

54:04.324 --> 54:07.076
Next thing we know, he'll lean
a ladder up against the garage wall

54:07.161 --> 54:08.661
and elope with the girl
in the middle of the night.

54:08.745 --> 54:09.912
Maybe!

54:09.997 --> 54:12.623
I'll overlook for the moment
the fact that you're an engaged man

54:12.708 --> 54:15.585
and merely remind you
of your marital record to date.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.337
I know, Father.
I've made three mistakes.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.673
First, that Hungarian countess

54:20.757 --> 54:22.800
who only married you
to bring her family over,

54:22.885 --> 54:25.094
her mother, her father and five brothers,

54:25.179 --> 54:28.347
all of them badly in need
of costly dental repairs.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.476
- Do we have to go through that again?
- Then that Twyman girl!

54:31.560 --> 54:33.936
Her family 50 years
on the Social Register,

54:34.021 --> 54:35.229
and she has the audacity

54:35.314 --> 54:37.398
to wear on her wedding dress
not a corsage,

54:37.483 --> 54:40.860
- but a Stevenson button!
- Father, you promised not to swear.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.862
Then that great actress,

54:42.946 --> 54:45.406
turns out all she does
is commercials on television

54:45.491 --> 54:47.325
for an underarm deodorant!

54:49.495 --> 54:51.329
And now our chauffeur's daughter!

54:51.413 --> 54:53.122
Father, are you through?
Because there's someone waiting.

54:53.207 --> 54:54.332
I'm not through,

54:54.416 --> 54:57.001
and I'm sure that your brother, Linus,
has a few words to say.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.754
Yes, I do, but I'm not so sure
you're going to like them, Father.

54:59.838 --> 55:01.506
I think you're being
a little unfair to David.

55:01.590 --> 55:02.673
I'm what?

55:02.758 --> 55:04.634
Well, I think David's old enough
to live his own life.

55:04.718 --> 55:06.177
If he decides Sabrina's the girl for him...

55:06.261 --> 55:07.303
Nonsense!

55:07.387 --> 55:09.388
- Linus, you really mean that?
- Well, of course I mean it.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.015
But it would knock your plans for a loop.

55:11.099 --> 55:14.227
What plans? The plastics merger?
Forget it.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.646
If you love her, take her.
This is the 20th century.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.815
Twentieth century? I could pick
a century out of a hat blindfolded

55:19.900 --> 55:21.275
and get a better one!

55:21.360 --> 55:23.611
You'll get rid of that girl immediately,
do you understand?

55:23.695 --> 55:25.530
And you'll apologise to your fiancée!

55:25.614 --> 55:30.409
Now, Father, don't push him.
Let's discuss this like civilized people.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.995
- Sit down, David.
- Thank you, Linus.

55:35.415 --> 55:37.166
Look, I really have to go.
Suppose you two work it out.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.543
You want me to help you or don't you?

55:38.627 --> 55:40.044
Of course, Linus.
I appreciate what you're doing.

55:40.128 --> 55:42.004
Then sit down!

55:42.089 --> 55:45.174
Linus, you're the only one in this family
who understands...

55:46.510 --> 55:48.594
Oh, no! No.

55:48.679 --> 55:52.139
- What is it? What happened?
- Champagne glasses. I sat on them.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.392
- On the chair?
- No, in my pocket!

56:44.109 --> 56:45.359
Sabrina?

56:49.906 --> 56:51.073
Hello.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.578
You did order champagne, didn't you?

56:55.662 --> 56:58.164
- What are you doing here?
- David sent me.

56:58.248 --> 57:01.250
- Isn't he coming?
- No. I don't think he'll be able to make it.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.211
- What happened?
- He got stuck.

57:05.505 --> 57:06.797
Stuck?

57:06.882 --> 57:09.842
Nothing serious.
Just one of those things.

57:09.926 --> 57:12.762
Shall I serve it up there,
or will you come down?

57:12.846 --> 57:16.223
- Up there? All right.
- No. I'll come down.

57:16.308 --> 57:19.810
We do meet under the most
peculiar circumstances, Sabrina.

57:19.895 --> 57:22.605
Either you're under eight cars
looking for a missing spark plug,

57:22.689 --> 57:23.939
or you're perched up here,

57:24.024 --> 57:27.985
umpiring a tennis match
between two players who aren't there.

57:28.070 --> 57:31.697
You look lovely, Sabrina,
and very grown-up.

57:31.782 --> 57:35.076
- I'd better get back to the party.
- And leave me here alone?

57:35.160 --> 57:36.369
What did David say?

57:36.453 --> 57:39.038
I didn't know what you did to him,
but I haven't seen him in such a state

57:39.122 --> 57:42.541
since he was kicked in the head
by a polo pony at Old Westbury.

57:42.626 --> 57:45.711
- That's nice.
- Amnesia has definitely set in.

57:45.796 --> 57:49.465
He's completely forgotten he's engaged.
He wants you.

57:49.549 --> 57:54.261
And I want him.
I've been in love with him all my life.

57:54.346 --> 57:55.930
Well, there goes the engagement.

57:56.014 --> 57:59.266
- You don't object?
- Object? To you?

57:59.351 --> 58:01.811
It's as though
a window had been thrown open

58:01.895 --> 58:05.064
and a lovely breeze
swept through this stuffy old house.

58:05.148 --> 58:06.565
How could I object?

58:06.650 --> 58:10.111
Even though the breeze comes from
the general direction of the garage?

58:10.195 --> 58:16.158
- This is the 20th century, Sabrina.
- Thank you. Let's drink to that.

58:16.243 --> 58:20.746
I'm sorry it isn't David here
instead of me, but it's all in the family.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.751
You know,
when you just walked in here,

58:25.836 --> 58:29.380
I was sure you'd been sent
by the family to deal with me.

58:29.464 --> 58:32.758
- To deal with you?
- Like in a Viennese operetta,

58:32.843 --> 58:36.053
the young prince falls in love
with the waitress at the rathskeller,

58:36.138 --> 58:38.514
and the prime minister
is sent to buy her off.

58:38.598 --> 58:40.766
- Buy her off?
- Yes.

58:40.851 --> 58:44.395
He offers her 5,000 kroner.
"No," she says.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.689
"10,000?" "No."

58:46.773 --> 58:49.066
- 15,000 kroner?
- No.

58:49.151 --> 58:51.068
- 25,000 kroner?
- No.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.779
- $25,000.
- No.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.364
How did dollars get into this?

58:55.449 --> 58:59.201
$25,000 after taxes.
That's a lot of money, Sabrina.

58:59.327 --> 59:02.913
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm just trying to make it worthwhile.

59:02.998 --> 59:04.206
What's a krone these days?

59:04.291 --> 59:08.002
No self-respecting prime minister
would offer kroner.

59:08.086 --> 59:10.796
No self-respecting waitress
would take dollars.

59:10.881 --> 59:15.426
Good girl.
Hey, how does this operetta end?

59:16.344 --> 59:18.804
- What's the last act?
- I didn't know.

59:18.889 --> 59:21.223
I guess they run away to America
on a zeppelin

59:21.308 --> 59:24.059
with everybody singing like mad.

59:24.144 --> 59:26.812
- They open a brewery in Milwaukee.
- Yes.

59:26.897 --> 59:28.647
The love that made Milwaukee famous.

59:34.988 --> 59:36.405
There it is.

59:42.204 --> 59:45.790
The song they were playing
the night before I went away.

59:48.126 --> 59:51.420
David was right here
dancing it with somebody else.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.757
Tonight I wanted it to be me.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.144
It's all in the family.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.630
How are we going to make sure that
all the fragments have been removed?

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:38.551
Very simple. We will reconstruct
the two champagne glasses.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.845
Now, I cannot possibly be hurting you.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.264
The area has been
completely anesthetized.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.267
It's not you. It's that song!

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.076
Sabrina.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.121
If David were here now,

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.082
you'd expect him to kiss you,
wouldn't you?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.506
Here's a kiss from David.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.851
It's all in the family.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.892
- Come in.
- Hi.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:16.357
- How do you feel?
- I never felt better in my life.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.234
No, you look fine.
The anesthetic worn off?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.364
I guess it has.
Well, I brought you a present.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.741
What happened
on the tennis court last night?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.701
Was Sabrina mad
because I didn't show up?

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:31.705
- Not mad, just disappointed.
- Poor kid. What did you tell her?

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:35.417
The truth. That the family objected
to her, but you stood up like a man...

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:38.003
- Good.
- ...and sat down like a jerk.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.050
Twenty-three stitches.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:49.098
Here. This ought to
make you feel better.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.600
A plastic hammock?

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.353
With a trap door. Designed it myself.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.147
- Ran it off at the factory this morning.
- On Sunday?

01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:00.567
But why not? You were in pain,
so I had them open up the plant.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.027
What a brother.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:06.907
All right. Let's try it on for size.
Come on. On your feet.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.455
I'll never drink champagne again
as long as I live.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.958
- What did you think of Sabrina?
- Wonderful girl.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.711
- Were you nice to her?
- As nice as I could be.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.379
What a brother.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:24.299
I've been trying to write a poem to her,
but I can't seem to finish it.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:27.136
- What rhymes with glass?
- Glass...

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.097
Glass...

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:34.476
- Alas.
- Of course.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:42.151
Right on the nose.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.069
- Linus!
- Sorry, David.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:49.658
If Sabrina were only here.

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:52.494
Hey, how about
smuggling her up in the dumbwaiter?

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.497
That would be dumb.
What if Father sees her?

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.709
Yeah, that's right. We wouldn't want to
do anything to spoil it, would we?

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.586
No, we sure wouldn't.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.088
- Linus, will you do me a favor?
- Anytime.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.590
I know how these things bore you,

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.842
but would you mind
keeping an eye on Sabrina for me?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.594
I've already thought of that.
As a matter of fact,

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.679
I'm taking her sailing this afternoon.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.098
- Sailing?
- In your boat.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.768
Honest? Oh, Sabrina.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:18.854
Tell her we'll be off, just the two of us,

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.939
the moment Dr. Calaway
takes the stitches out.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.816
Well, then,
you've already made up your mind.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.277
Absolutely. This is it!

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.362
Yes, well, I...
I just wanted to make sure,

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.698
because this has been it
three times before.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:32.743
I was blind, that's why. It's been
Sabrina and I since we were kids.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.703
I just couldn't see her for the tree.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.164
And what about Elizabeth?
What about Father and Mother?

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.416
So what about them?
Elizabeth will be so broken up,

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.210
she'll go out and buy three new hats.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.213
Mother will go to bed with a severe
headache and the latest Mickey Spillane

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:47.466
and Father will take to the bottle openly
and smoke six Corona Coronas

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.636
and then threaten to exile me
to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.555
- and that's where you come in, Linus.
- How?

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:57.392
I didn't want to go to Butte, Montana.
You're going to help me, aren't you?

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.687
Yes. Yes. I'm going to help you.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.149
- Aren't I?
- What a brother.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.822
How's my poor darling?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.908
I brought you six books, dear,
and a game of Scrabble.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.369
Scrabble? I'm in no condition
to play Scrabble.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.663
Don't be silly.
That's all you are in a condition to play.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.457
I still didn't understand what those
glasses were doing in your pockets.

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:23.752
I was taking them down to the tennis
court. There was somebody waiting.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.213
There was a game going on.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.423
In the dark? In the middle of the night?

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:31.260
Yes. That's why he needed the glasses.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.683
Yes. That's why I needed the glasses.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.608
- Shall we play three-handed?
- No, thanks.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.570
- I've got to go sailing.
- Yes, he's got to go sailing.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:52.489
And no more false moves now,
not until those stitches are out.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:53.657
Yes, Linus.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.493
We don't want any complications
to set in, do we?

01:05:56.578 --> 01:06:00.289
So long, Elizabeth. So long, Scarface.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:25.147
- Good afternoon, Father.
- I thought it was your mother.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.984
I didn't mind you smoking in my room,
but not in my clothes closet.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.611
It's good for the moths.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:33.322
Now, then, Linus,
what about that girl over the garage?

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.781
David wants to run off with her.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.825
That's nice,
with the chauffeur's daughter.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.203
I didn't care if he runs off
with the gardener's grandmother!

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:41.455
I just don't want him to run off
with the plastics merger.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.499
I have a very simple solution,
we'll fire Fairchild.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.710
Not after 25 years, Father.

01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:48.545
All right, then,
we'll write her a nice little check

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.380
and tell her to forget about David.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:53.133
She doesn't want money.
She wants love.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:56.845
- I thought they discontinued that model.
- The last of the romantics.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.307
Why does she have to pick on David?

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.851
Why can't she be in love
with someone else?

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.728
We will do our best.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.855
- Is that the idea?
- Yep.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.857
- You've got someone in mind for her?
- Yep.

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.025
Who?

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:13.403
Boola, boola
Boola, boola

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:14.738
Boola, boola...

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:18.033
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.118
Not you, Linus!

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.829
Look, do you think
this is any fun for me?

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.125
I've got a whole desk full of work I was
planning to clean up over the weekend,

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.961
I'm supposed to be in Texas
on the sulfur deal,

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.714
the whole Puerto Rican operation has
to be set in motion in the next 48 hours,

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.509
and here I am going off in a sailboat
to make an ass out of myself

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.177
with a girl 22.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:40.847
Look at me.
Joe College with a touch of arthritis.

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:46.061
Could you use this
for sailing into the sunset?

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:47.980
I wish I were dead with my back broken.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.690
Just a thought.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.192
Hey, music might help.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:56.196
Seems to me I had a portable
phonograph from my freshman days.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.450
I only hope
you remember what to do with a girl.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.704
It'll come back to me.
It's like riding a bicycle.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:26.059
This is a very unusual song.
Is it popular?

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.310
Oh, yes.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:31.773
- Wonder why I never heard it before.
- You've been in Paris for two years.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:35.736
Yes, we have no bananas

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:39.281
We have no bananas today

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.075
How did they ever think of those words?

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.910
Oh, they are clever, aren't they?

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.912
- May I play another?
- Of course.

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:48.707
- You need dusting.
- I beg your pardon?

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.209
- I didn't mean you, Linus.
- Thank you.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.502
How's David?

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:55.130
Well, he's been flat on his stomach,
but he's feeling better, thank you.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.881
Now he's flat on his back.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:00.594
I miss him.
Not that I'm not having a good time.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.933
- Sabrina.
- Yes?

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:11.270
- You mind if we turned this off?
- Why?

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.316
- Because...
- Don't you like it?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.109
I used to like it.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.828
Certain songs bring back
sudden memories to me, too.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.831
Did you love her?

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.835
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.462
That's all right.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.591
So strange to think of you
being touched by a woman.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:45.430
- I always thought you walked alone.
- No man walks alone from choice.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:51.144
As a child, I used to watch you
from the window over the garage,

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.898
coming and going,
always wearing your black homburg

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.984
and carrying a briefcase
and an umbrella.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:03.323
I thought you could never belong
to anyone, never care for anyone.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.283
Yes, the cold businessman

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:08.328
behind his marble desk
way up in his executive suite.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:12.791
No emotion, just ice water in his veins
and ticker tape coming from his heart.

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:18.505
And yet, one day,
that same cold businessman,

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:22.884
high up in a skyscraper, opens
a window and steps out on a ledge,

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:27.180
stands there for three hours, wondering

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.599
- if he should jump.
- Because of her?

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:32.144
No. No, that was another woman.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:36.189
Sabrina, do you find it hard to believe
that someone might want to

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:39.359
blot out everything
for sentimental reasons?

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.777
I believe it.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:44.823
You know what I almost did
because of sentimental reasons? I...

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:48.410
I went to Paris to blot it out.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.079
- Maybe you should go to Paris, Linus.
- To Paris?

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.206
It helped me a lot.
Have you ever been there?

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.585
Yes. Yes. Once.
I was there for 35 minutes.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.962
- Thirty-five minutes?
- Changing planes.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.882
I was on my way to Iraq on an oil deal.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:07.512
But Paris isn't for changing planes.
It's for changing your outlook,

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.932
for throwing open the windows
and letting in...

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.685
Letting in la vie en rose.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:18.857
Paris is for lovers. Maybe that's
why I stayed only 35 minutes.

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:03.568
Hi, David. Hello, Father.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.864
Margaret has some dinner for you
in the kitchen, Sabrina.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:11.868
Funny, I used to be so afraid of him.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:13.578
Aren't you hungry?

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:19.626
Father, you've driven Linus
for so many years.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.044
What do you know about him?

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:23.838
A chauffeur is supposed to
keep his eyes on the road, Sabrina.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:27.384
Only once in a while does he get
a glimpse in the rear-view mirror.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:31.805
If you looked a little longer, Father,
you'd find him rather nice

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:34.641
and quite human.

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:47.112
We have no bananas

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:50.615
Today

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.869
Good morning, Miss McCardle.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:57.664
First, a wire to Hannegan,
Fort Worth, Texas.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:01.960
Unable to attend
Larrabee Sulfur board meeting

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:06.631
because of slight hitch
Larrabee Plastics merger. Got that?

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:10.010
Next. Here's the itinerary for tonight.

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.262
I want two tickets to
The Seven Year Itch,

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.764
table for two at the Colony
before the show,

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:17.559
a table for two at the Persian Room
after the show.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.353
Make it a corner table, a dark corner.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.523
I'm just passing La Guardia Field.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:27.360
You can put the coffee on
in 10 minutes. Make it strong.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.488
- Fairchild, I'll be needing you tonight.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:33.366
- I'm taking Sabrina out again.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:37.495
- Will you have her at my office at 7:00?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.874
Anything wrong, Fairchild?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.710
I would very much prefer that
you dispense with my services

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.879
on these dates with my daughter, sir.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.548
It makes for a rather awkward situation.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:51.635
I see. Well, that never occurred to me.
I'm sorry.

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:55.263
It's just not right, sir.
I like to think of life as a limousine.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:58.600
Though we're all driving together,
we must remember our places.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:02.687
There's a front seat and a back seat
and a window in between.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:06.566
Fairchild, I never realised it before,
but you're a terrible snob.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.194
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.613
Have her take one of the other cars
and drive in herself.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.032
- Have her take David's car.
- Thank you, sir.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:18.411
It's all so distressing.
First Mr. David, now you.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.747
I wish Sabrina
would have stayed in Paris.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.374
So do I.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.628
May I ask, sir,
what exactly are your intentions?

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.924
My intentions? Unethical,
reprehensible, but very practical.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.092
Beg pardon?

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:35.512
With your permission, Fairchild, I'm
shipping your daughter back to Paris.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:36.638
- You are, sir?
- That is,

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:38.807
I'm going to try to ship her back.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:42.268
- May I ask how, sir?
- First class, of course.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.270
And I don't want you
to worry about money.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.482
It's not money I'm worried about, sir.
It's Sabrina.

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:51.486
- I just don't want her to get hurt.
- I'll be as gentle as I can.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:52.862
I hope so, sir.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.740
She's just a displaced person,
I'm afraid.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.784
She doesn't belong in a mansion,

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.037
but then again, she doesn't belong
above a garage, either.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.212
All right.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.049
The meeting of the board of directors
of the Larrabee Industries

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:15.802
will now come to order.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:20.098
As the chairman of the board,
I would like to say at the outset...

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:22.600
The chairman is so dizzy.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:29.107
Meeting adjourned.
Have a frozen daiquiri.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.860
I once saw an office like this
in an old copy

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:35.155
of Fortune magazine at my dentist's.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.658
- Has David got an office like this?
- Something like this, only larger.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.118
- Larger?
- Yes.

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:42.662
Instead of a desk,
he has a putting green.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:46.249
Please, Sabrina,
before my fingers get frostbitten.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:56.342
- Is this the ledge?
- What ledge?

01:15:56.469 --> 01:16:00.597
You know, the ledge,
that woman, when you almost...

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.350
The ledge.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:06.686
Yes.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:12.066
- Yes, that's the ledge all right.
- What made you not do it?

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:15.069
There were some children
playing hopscotch on the sidewalk.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:19.532
I'm very fond of those children.
Look at all these gadgets.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:23.870
Just imagine,
you press a button and factories go up,

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:28.541
or you pick up a telephone
and 100 tankers set out for Persia,

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.585
or you switch on the Dictaphone
and say,

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:33.880
"Buy all of Cleveland
and move it to Pittsburgh."

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.674
- You must be awfully clever.
- It's nothing, really.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:38.968
Just a small knack,
like juggling three oranges.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:42.055
It isn't oranges. It's millions.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.641
- Suppose you dropped one?
- Suppose I did.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:47.435
What's at the end of a million?
Zero, zero, zero. Nothing.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.687
A circle with a hole in it.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.441
- Sabrina.
- Yes, Linus?

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:55.735
- Can you keep a secret?
- Secret?

01:16:55.861 --> 01:17:00.907
Yes, of course you can.
I want you to look out there, uptown.

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:06.246
- You see the French Line pier?
- Yes.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:08.706
- You see the boat?
- Yes.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:14.504
That's the Liberté. It sails on Thursday.
I'm going to be on it.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.882
- You are?
- Yes, I am.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.760
I'm sick of pushing buttons,
sick of secretaries, sick of this office.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:23.638
I'm breaking out of here, Sabrina.
I'm running away.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.515
- Good for you.
- I've been thinking about Paris

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:28.434
ever since you mentioned it.
It's all your fault, Sabrina.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:32.188
It'll make a new person out of you,
I guarantee or double your money back.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:35.233
Linus, I'm so glad you're going.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.069
Or am I?

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:48.454
It's 7:35, Mr. Larrabee. You have
a dinner reservation at the Colony.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:49.956
Thank you.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.963
- Ready, Sabrina?
- Tout de suite, as they say in Paris.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.756
Curtain is at 8:40.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.508
I used your brother's name
at the Colony.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.261
I got you the darkest corner.

01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:06.931
I'm sorry, Mr. Larrabee.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.737
This is what you do
on your very first day in Paris.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.655
You get yourself some rain,

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:25.992
not just a drizzle
but honest-to-goodness rain.

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:28.995
Then you find yourself
someone really nice

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.040
and drive her through
the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.751
The rain's very important,

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:37.670
because that's when Paris
smells its sweetest.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:41.174
- It's the damp chestnut trees, you see?
- I see.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:46.679
You're very clever, Linus, and very rich.
You can order yourself some rain.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:53.436
Oh, sure. I can order myself some rain.
I can get myself a taxi. That's easy.

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:57.857
But can I find myself
someone really nice?

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.360
That's not so easy, Sabrina.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:35.144
How do you say in French,
"My sister has a yellow pencil"?

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:42.986
How do you say,
"My brother has a lovely girl"?

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:50.910
And how do you say,
"I wish I were my brother"?

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.948
Why are you looking at me that way?

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:32.660
All night long, I've had the most terrible
impulse to do something.

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:36.956
Never resist an impulse, Sabrina,
especially if it's terrible.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.624
I'm going to do it.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.295
- There.
- What's that for?

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.297
We can't have you walking up and down
the Champs Élysées

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:48.051
looking like a tourist undertaker.
And another thing.

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:53.014
Never a briefcase in Paris
and never an umbrella. There's a law.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:57.477
How am I ever going to get along
in Paris without someone like you?

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.146
Who'll be there to help me
with my French,

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.607
to turn down the brim of my hat?

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:06.944
Suppose you meet someone
on the boat, the very first day out,

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:08.988
a perfect stranger.

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:15.244
I have a better suppose, Sabrina.
Suppose I were 10 years younger.

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:20.500
Suppose you weren't in love with David.
Suppose I asked you to...

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.672
I suppose I'm just talking nonsense.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.177
I suppose so.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:37.767
Suppose you sing
that song again. Slowly.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:32.613
Hi! I thought you two had eloped.
I wouldn't mind, but not in my car.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.699
- Hello, David.
- Did you have a good time?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.617
- So-so.
- Where'd you go?

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:39.620
We saw The Seven Year Itch,
then went on to the Persian Room.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:42.290
- Lousy dancer, isn't he?
- So-so.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.541
I bet he slept through half the show,

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.376
and then bent your ears back
the rest of the evening with

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:48.629
Dow Jones Averages, corporate
structures, excess profits taxes...

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:51.465
We talked about a lot of things.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.886
- How's your little mishap?
- Shaping up beautifully.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.471
Dr. Calaway's so proud of the job,
he wants to show it to his class

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:59.390
at Columbia Medical School.

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.227
- I'm sorry, Sabrina.
- It's very funny.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:07.315
Say, Linus, while I was lying
in that hammock, I got a great idea.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.901
He thinks I'm an idiot.
How does this strike you?

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.486
Champagne glasses out of plastic,
just in case.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:15.990
Brilliant. What else did
Dr. Calaway have to say?

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.658
Stitches come out Thursday.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.327
- Thursday?
- I'm a fast healer.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.494
You sure are.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:22.997
So if you two have
any long-range plans...

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.665
Oh, no, nothing long-range.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:27.001
I just thought Sabrina would like
to see the stock exchange

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:30.504
- and our plant in Jersey.
- I didn't think so.

01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:33.090
Well, then we'll just have dinner in town
and go to a show.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.842
But that's all, Brother,
because come Thursday,

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.761
the first team takes over.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.763
Hey, what's with the homburg?

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:46.354
Well, I guess the undertaker
better turn in,

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:50.524
and you'd better crawl back
into that hole in your hammock.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:54.070
- Au revoir, Sabrina.
- Good night, Linus.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:09.043
He's a little on the dull side, isn't he?
But you can't help liking him.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.381
- Kiss me, David.
- Love to, Sabrina.

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:18.219
Again.

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:26.060
- That's better.
- What's the matter, darling?

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.229
You're not worried about us, are you?
Because I'm not.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:30.815
So there'll be a big stink in the family.
So who cares?

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:34.318
David, I don't think I'm going
to have dinner with Linus.

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:37.571
- I didn't want to go out with him.
- Why not?

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.240
I want to be near you.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.909
I know how you feel, Sabrina.
It must be an awful bore.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:44.745
But if Linus wants to take you out,
let's be nice about it.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.415
It's very important. He's our only ally.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.167
Don't you see?
Father will try to cut off my allowance

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.503
and send me off to Larrabee Copper
in Butte, Montana,

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:55.089
and we don't want to go
to Butte, Montana, do we?

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.258
Hold me close, David.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.846
We'll have a wonderful time, darling.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:04.765
We'll build ourselves a raft
and drift across the Pacific,

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.267
like Kon Tiki,

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:11.522
or climb the highest mountain,
like Annapurna. Just the two of us.

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:15.276
Keep talking, David. Keep talking.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.616
We thought of pink roses
for the cherubs

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.368
and white gardenias for the names.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:28.289
It'll take about 2,000 gardenias.
We'll float the whole thing in our pool.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:31.125
- Indoor or outdoor?
- Outdoor, of course.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.460
We drained the water
from the indoor pool

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:33.627
to make room for the wedding presents.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:35.796
Where's the provision
determining the ratio

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:38.299
of invested capital
to controlling interest?

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.719
Page 62, paragraph 6, subdivision B.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.889
- Father, where's the list?
- Here you are, darling.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.975
Would you like to see the invitation list?

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:21.592
516,740 under trust of Illinois, 550...

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.188
Who are your lawyers, Linus?

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:35.856
The way this merger's worked out,

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:38.359
I have all the titles
and you have all the control.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.611
I always make it a point
to have controls.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:43.864
Yeah. It's just your good luck
the kids are so fond of each other.

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:46.117
I always make it a point to be lucky, too.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.451
Come along, Father.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:50.037
Linus, you won't forget
the gardenias now, will you?

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.039
Tony Lennox has the sweetest idea.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:54.959
He's gonna fly over the chapel
and throw rice at us from his plane.

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:58.546
With David the bridegroom,
maybe he'd better use wild rice.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:26:59.630
Oh, Father.

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:20.443
All I can say is
David better show up at this wedding.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:23.988
I have a horrible vision of Elizabeth
waiting at the altar

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:28.325
and 2,000 gardenias floating
in the pool, spelling disaster.

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:30.578
A memo to Miss McCardle.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.746
First, call Brunson
in Larrabee Shipping.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:37.334
We'll be needing 2,000 gardenias.
Tell him to start cornering the market.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:38.919
- Next, I want...
- You're not having any trouble

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:42.339
with that... I never can remember
that garage girl's name.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:43.674
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.093
What right has a chauffeur got
to call his daughter Sabrina?

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.179
What would you suggest, Ethel?

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.598
You've been taking her out now
three nights in a row.

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.183
Is that situation in hand?

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:56.020
I think so. It's resolving itself
into a straight export deal.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.188
And next, Miss McCardle,

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.107
I want two accommodations
on the Liberté, one in the name

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.943
of Miss Sabrina Fairchild,
one in my name.

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:05.946
What's this? What's this? You and
that girl going off on a boat together?

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.699
Have I spawned two idiot sons?

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.534
Who said I was going? She's going

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.621
because she'll think that I'm going,
but I'm not really going. Is that clear?

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.206
It is not.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:18.125
I'm going to tell Sabrina
that I'll meet her on the boat.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:22.463
When the boat is 10 miles out at sea,
she'll find out that I'm not on the boat.

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:23.547
My cabin will be empty,

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:27.218
just a note of apology
and a few presents to soften the blow.

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:30.221
- Excellent.
- Yes. I thought you'd like it.

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:34.058
And, next, Miss McCardle,
I want flowers in Miss Fairchild's cabin.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.977
Candy, fruit
and the usual what-have-yous.

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:40.731
Next, cable Michot to get her
a car in Paris. Also an apartment.

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:43.150
Next, a letter of credit
on our Paris bank.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.986
- She can draw up to 50,000.
- Easy now.

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:50.491
Next, transfer to Thomas Fairchild
1,000 shares Larrabee Common.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.660
One thousand shares?

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:55.412
Make it 1,500 shares,
Larrabee Preferred.

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:57.665
It seems to me there ought to be
a less extravagant way

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:00.334
of getting a chauffeur's daughter
out of one's hair.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:05.172
How would you do it? You can't even
get a little olive out of a jar.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.258
Eat it!

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.884
Going up?

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.804
No, thank you.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.661
- Yes?
- Miss Fairchild for you, Mr. Larrabee.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:21.081
- Send her in.
- She's on the phone. Take it on five.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:27.504
Sabrina? What happened to you?
It's 8:20.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:30.007
Good evening, Linus.

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:33.427
I know I'm late. I guess maybe
I should have called you earlier.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:35.471
I can't see you tonight.

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:40.017
I'm very sorry. I just can't make it.
I tried, but I'm all tied up.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:44.271
No, I'm not on Long Island.
I'm in New York.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:48.525
Downtown in a phone booth.
In a building.

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:52.446
What difference does it make
what building, Linus? I...

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.865
I can't see you tonight.

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:58.786
All right. It's the Larrabee building,
but I'm not coming up.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:04.208
Now, look, Sabrina, suppose you
tell me exactly what's on your mind,

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:08.295
slowly and clearly.
You talk, and I'll listen.

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:13.634
Well, you see, it was really David's idea
I go out with you,

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:15.386
because he wants you to help him.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.471
But the trouble is,
it's not helping me any.

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:19.473
I shouldn't have been seeing you, Linus.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.350
I shouldn't even be
talking to you on the phone.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.145
In fact, I'm really only calling
to say goodbye because

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:31.151
tomorrow you'll be on the boat to Paris.
In a way, I'm glad you're going.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:34.154
You do know what I mean,
don't you, Linus? Linus?

01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:39.576
Hello, Linus? Where are you, Linus?

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:44.748
- Your three minutes are up.
- Hello.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:48.836
Isn't it silly? I was talking to myself.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.047
You wasted a dime, too. Come on.

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:56.176
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Of course not.

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:58.345
I have a perfectly good reason
why I shouldn't see you tonight.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.097
Not here, Sabrina.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.282
All right, Sabrina,

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:22.286
what is that perfectly good reason
why you shouldn't see me?

01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:34.214
What is it? What's bothering you?

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:38.218
It's me that's bothering me.

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:44.099
Please don't.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.727
I'm sorry.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.733
I know I'm not making
much sense, Linus.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.818
Would you like a drink?

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:58.989
- I didn't think I want a drink.
- I think I do.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:07.748
- Why don't you sit down?
- I can only stay a minute.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:11.335
- Mind if I turn on just this little one?
- If you want.

01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:20.928
I'd hate to fix myself a martini
with crème de menthe.

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:25.682
Yes?

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:27.935
I've canceled your dinner reservation,
Mr. Larrabee.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.270
What about the theater tickets?

01:33:30.355 --> 01:33:33.148
I couldn't possibly go anywhere.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.694
They're all yours, Miss McCardle.
Good night.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:45.118
- Sure you won't have even one?
- No, thanks.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:50.457
- You must be hungry.
- I hadn't thought about it.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:55.295
I'm starved. I was sort of
saving myself for 21 tonight.

01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:59.550
- I've spoiled your evening, haven't I?
- No, you haven't.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:03.720
We can have dinner right here. Let's
see what Miss McCardle is hoarding.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:08.559
Probably maraschino cherries
and stale crackers.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:14.773
Tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines,
tomato juice, tomato juice, tomato juice.

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.775
That's an awful lot of tomato juice.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.819
Suppose you can fix something
out of all this?

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:20.237
I suppose so.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.698
I'm a graduate cook, you know.
I have a diploma.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:24.950
It'll take a diploma.

01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:39.590
I wanted to be so sure
I couldn't go out with you tonight,

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:43.427
and here I am, cooking for you.

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:46.555
I guess maybe
I should have worn an apron.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:48.473
One apron coming up.

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:55.856
Pots, pans, can opener,
stove, all the comforts of home.

01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.777
Now, Miss McCardle once cooked
dinner here for the board of directors.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.322
After the first course,
there was a move to adjourn.

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:05.574
It was passed unanimously.

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:16.585
- What do we start with?
- I haven't decided yet.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:24.301
Now, Sabrina, let's have none of those.

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:31.892
- I'm so ashamed, Linus.
- Well, you have no reason to be.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:36.980
I've known you only a few days,
just a few days, really,

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:41.234
and I've been in love
with David all my life.

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:44.905
I can't understand
what's the matter with me.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:48.033
I went away to grow up,
and I thought I had grown up,

01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:50.535
but I guess I haven't, really.

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:55.332
I just got myself a new hairdo, that's all.

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:01.463
- Please say something.
- Well, like what?

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:06.885
I didn't know.
Tell me I'm imagining things.

01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:11.932
Tell me you never even thought of
taking me on the boat to Paris with you.

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:16.770
Tell me to put on my coat and go home
before I make a complete fool of myself.

01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:22.859
But don't let me go home.
I couldn't bear it.

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:26.947
This is the last time
we're going to see each other.

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:33.036
- I'll behave, Linus. I'm all right now.
- That's good.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:35.122
Now, how about dinner?

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:37.082
I just remembered
I didn't have any lunch today.

01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.751
- You didn't?
- Or any breakfast, either.

01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:42.754
That may account for a lot of things.

01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:47.175
- Would you like a soufflé for dessert?
- Out of tomato juice?

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:50.846
- Out of crackers, of course.
- Not too soggy, huh?

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.974
You'd better get out of the kitchen.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.295
Which one is the Liberté?

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:27.799
- The one on the right.
- Are you sure?

01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:31.386
- You mustn't take the wrong boat.
- I'll try not to.

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:34.389
You haven't forgotten
my instructions, have you?

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:37.184
Never an umbrella in Paris

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:40.812
and under all circumstances,
rain the very first day.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:46.276
I haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina.
My sister has a yellow pencil.

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:49.988
Very good.

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:56.453
Watch. One, two, three, crack.

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:59.748
New egg. It's all in the wrist.

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:11.551
There must be
an eggbeater somewhere.

01:38:32.865 --> 01:38:34.825
Linus.

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:51.216
Linus, why didn't you tell me?

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:55.220
You do want to take me with you,
don't you?

01:39:00.685 --> 01:39:02.561
These don't mean
what you think they mean.

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:05.480
I know why you didn't tell me,
because you think it's wrong.

01:39:05.565 --> 01:39:06.690
They'll say I'm too young for you,

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:10.569
that it'll be an awful scandal,
and the market will go down.

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:15.031
Linus Larrabee, Esquire,
is taking me to Paris.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:19.286
Sabrina. I...

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:24.207
I wasn't going to take you to Paris.
I was going to send you.

01:39:27.879 --> 01:39:30.922
- Alone?
- Yes. All alone.

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:38.513
- But there's a ticket for you.
- For an empty cabin.

01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:42.601
- You were joining me in Paris, is that it?
- I'm afraid not.

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:53.778
- I think I understand.
- I'm sorry.

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:59.534
But why? Why did you do it, Linus?

01:39:59.619 --> 01:40:03.163
High finance, expansion,
the marriage, a merger,

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:06.458
a new plaque on the Larrabee building.
You got in the way.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:07.834
- David?
- That's right.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.424
How inconsiderate of me.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.053
And how inconvenient for you.

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:22.807
Such a busy man having to waste
so much time just to get me on a boat.

01:40:23.643 --> 01:40:27.312
I'm ashamed to say
I enjoyed every minute of it.

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:32.817
And I suppose in your empty cabin
there would have been a farewell note

01:40:32.902 --> 01:40:36.488
dictated to and typed by Miss McCardle.

01:40:37.823 --> 01:40:41.451
- And perhaps a few flowers.
- A little more than that.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:55.674
A letter of credit,
an apartment in Paris, a car,

01:40:55.758 --> 01:40:59.844
1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred
for your father.

01:40:59.929 --> 01:41:01.638
You're very generous.

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:04.766
We regard it as
a necessary business expense.

01:41:06.519 --> 01:41:09.479
I'll just take one of those tickets.

01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:15.777
I was happy in Paris.

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:19.322
I think you would have been, too.

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:31.501
Good night, Mr. Larrabee.

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:34.546
I'm sorry I can't stay to do the dishes.

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:58.403
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:41:58.487 --> 01:42:02.365
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:42:17.673 --> 01:42:20.550
- Mr. Larrabee?
- Come in, Miss McCardle.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.512
- Good morning.
- Good morning. You're late.

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:26.598
Had to make my own coffee.
Worst ever.

01:42:26.682 --> 01:42:29.142
I'm sorry.
I had a very bad night last night.

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:33.688
I know exactly how you feel.
Well, you better get that pad.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.065
We have things to do.

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.025
I used your theater tickets
and took my mother.

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:38.860
- You ready?
- Yes.

01:42:38.944 --> 01:42:40.153
First, call Larrabee Shipping.

01:42:40.237 --> 01:42:43.573
Tell them to radio all our tankers
bound for Puerto Rico to turn back.

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:47.243
Next, call Larrabee Construction,
tell them to stop work on the new plant.

01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:50.080
We're canceling
the Larrabee Plastics merger.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:51.247
We are?

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:54.626
Next, I want Mr. Larrabee, Sr.,
Mr. Tyson and Miss Elizabeth Tyson

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.087
here in this office as soon as possible.

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:59.589
Better have a large bottle
of smelling salts around.

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.800
- We're calling off the wedding.
- We are?

01:43:01.884 --> 01:43:03.760
- When's your mother's birthday?
- Why?

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:07.722
I'm sending her 2,000 gardenias.
Here's a ticket for the Liberté.

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:10.725
Have it transferred to the name
of Mr. David Larrabee.

01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:13.269
Better get his passport out
and make sure it's in order.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:16.398
Next, see if you can locate David.
The boat sails at noon.

01:43:16.482 --> 01:43:19.025
I've been calling the house for an hour,
and he isn't there.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:22.070
Try Dr. Calaway.
Try everywhere, but get him.

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:25.490
Do you still want me to send all those
presents to Miss Fairchild's cabin?

01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:28.952
- No. We're sending David instead.
- Good morning.

01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:33.706
You'll be happy to hear
the stitches are out.

01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:34.833
It's as good as new.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:37.252
Congratulations.
I've been looking for you.

01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.170
And I have been looking for you.

01:43:39.255 --> 01:43:41.506
You're leaving for Paris today.
It's all arranged.

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:44.008
- No kidding.
- With Sabrina.

01:43:44.093 --> 01:43:45.176
She's gonna be on the boat.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:51.015
- She have to be in here?
- All right, Miss McCardle,

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.518
you've got a lot of work to do.

01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:56.354
Aren't you pleased with the news?
What's the matter with you?

01:43:56.439 --> 01:43:58.356
I saw Sabrina
when she came home last night.

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:00.525
Found her packing.

01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:03.361
- And what'd she say?
- Nothing. She just kissed me.

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:04.612
What's wrong with that?

01:44:04.697 --> 01:44:06.781
Well, I may know nothing
about Dow Jones Averages,

01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:08.408
but I do know something about kisses.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:11.327
Yes, you could
lecture on that at Vassar.

01:44:11.412 --> 01:44:13.830
This one tasted like a goodbye kiss.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:17.917
- You're just imagining things.
- No. It had a few tears in it.

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:21.629
I'm not very bright.

01:44:21.714 --> 01:44:23.506
It took me until this morning
to add two and two together,

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:27.552
like two champagne glasses
and the plastics deal and Sabrina.

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:29.179
- You know what I got?
- What?

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.559
Sorry I had to do it
to a tired businessman.

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:38.855
That's all right. Well, now we're even.

01:44:40.858 --> 01:44:42.567
Suppose you go on home
and start packing.

01:44:42.651 --> 01:44:43.902
I'll take care of Elizabeth.

01:44:43.986 --> 01:44:46.070
I'm calling off the merger
at the board meeting.

01:44:46.155 --> 01:44:48.281
Miss McCardle will have your passport
and your ticket.

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:50.241
Let her know if you need any money.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:54.704
I want you and Sabrina
to have a good time in Paris. Goodbye.

01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:57.707
What makes you so sure
Sabrina still wants me?

01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:00.084
Of course she wants you.
She's wanted you all her life.

01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:01.920
Until you came along
in that silly homburg.

01:45:02.004 --> 01:45:04.380
Well, suppose you straighten
that silly straw hat and on your way.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:08.718
- You'll miss the boat.
- Don't worry. I won't miss the boat.

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:10.136
I'm going.

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:14.265
Funniest thing, Linus Larrabee,

01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:16.893
the man who doesn't burn,
doesn't scorch, doesn't melt,

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:20.188
suddenly throws
a $20 million deal out the window.

01:45:22.942 --> 01:45:24.943
Are you sure
you don't want to go with her?

01:45:25.027 --> 01:45:28.571
- Why should I want to go with her?
- Because you're in love with her.

01:45:37.957 --> 01:45:41.793
You won't be annoyed
if I cry at the boat, will you, Sabrina?

01:45:41.877 --> 01:45:44.587
I'll be disappointed if you don't, Father.

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:47.006
I'd feel so much better
if only you'd be angry with me

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:48.633
for allowing all this to happen.

01:45:48.717 --> 01:45:51.553
It wasn't your fault, Father. It was mine.

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:59.310
I should have believed you.
There's a front seat and a back seat.

01:45:59.395 --> 01:46:01.729
- And a window in between.
- And a window in between.

01:46:03.315 --> 01:46:06.818
If it's any consolation, one good thing
has come out of it anyway.

01:46:06.902 --> 01:46:09.487
You did get over David, didn't you?

01:46:09.572 --> 01:46:14.158
Dear David. Yes, I did get over that.
I'm cured.

01:46:16.245 --> 01:46:18.621
Now how to get over the cure?

01:46:20.332 --> 01:46:23.084
It wouldn't have worked out,
really, darling. The papers

01:46:23.168 --> 01:46:25.962
and everybody else would have said,
"How fine and democratic

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.006
"for a Larrabee to marry
the chauffeur's daughter."

01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:31.843
But would they praise
the chauffeur's daughter? No.

01:46:31.927 --> 01:46:35.179
Democracy can be
a wickedly unfair thing, Sabrina.

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:40.977
Nobody poor was ever called
democratic for marrying somebody rich.

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:08.463
Why don't we start this meeting
and sign the papers?

01:47:08.547 --> 01:47:11.215
- We're waiting for David, of course.
- Yes, we're waiting for David.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.801
That boy has no sense of time,
no sense of direction.

01:47:13.886 --> 01:47:17.096
As a matter of fact, he has no sense.
Where is he, Linus?

01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:19.932
We'll get to that in a minute.

01:47:20.017 --> 01:47:21.726
Here are the smelling salts,
Mr. Larrabee.

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:23.936
I got you the largest size.

01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:30.943
Linus, look what I bought him for
Waikiki beach.

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:32.570
I hope they're loud enough.

01:47:34.239 --> 01:47:36.282
I hope they're returnable.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:48.211
Well, gentlemen,
I see no need for any further delay.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.545
Suppose we get down to business.

01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.464
- But what about David?
- Yes, what about David?

01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:55.176
That's a very good question. Not yet.

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.430
Tyson, members of the board...
Are you with us, Father?

01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:01.724
Present.

01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:06.479
As you know, gentlemen,
we are here today to put our signatures

01:48:06.563 --> 01:48:08.898
to the Larrabee-Tyson merger.

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:11.275
Much effort has gone into
making this union possible,

01:48:11.402 --> 01:48:14.779
long hours,
many obstacles to overcome.

01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:20.618
Nobody knows better than I.
However... Not yet.

01:48:21.787 --> 01:48:25.081
However, sometimes even the most
conscientious of businessmen

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:28.501
can botch up a deal
for one reason or another.

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:34.132
Understand I don't mean to say
that our merger has hit a snag

01:48:34.216 --> 01:48:39.637
or failed to gel or gone up in smoke
or fallen through.

01:48:39.722 --> 01:48:43.641
Let me put it this way, gentlemen.
It has sailed away.

01:48:47.646 --> 01:48:51.524
I seem to have missed something here.
Would you mind starting all over again?

01:48:51.608 --> 01:48:53.860
Now, Miss McCardle.

01:48:53.944 --> 01:48:56.070
Elizabeth, I hate to have
to break the news to you,

01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:58.990
but at this very moment,
your fiancé, Mr. David Larrabee...

01:48:59.074 --> 01:49:00.700
Is late as usual.

01:49:05.414 --> 01:49:10.001
Hello, everybody. Hello, darling.
Hello, Linus, how are you?

01:49:10.085 --> 01:49:12.003
What are you doing here?

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:14.338
I heard there was
a board meeting going on.

01:49:14.423 --> 01:49:16.424
Where are the contracts?
Where do I sign?

01:49:16.508 --> 01:49:19.135
- Where's Sabrina?
- Sabrina? Who's Sabrina?

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:22.388
- That name. That name.
- She's on the boat, I guess.

01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:25.016
Yeah, but the boat has sailed.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.101
- And there she goes.
- Who goes?

01:49:27.186 --> 01:49:29.687
- Sabrina.
- Who is Sabrina?

01:49:29.772 --> 01:49:32.607
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?

01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:36.944
- She's all alone out there.
- Not according to the afternoon papers.

01:49:37.029 --> 01:49:39.697
It says here that "Linus Larrabee..."
That's you, isn't it?

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:41.908
"...and Sabrina Fairchild..."
That's she, isn't it?

01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:45.870
"...have quietly reserved adjacent deck
chairs on the Liberté, sailing today."

01:49:45.954 --> 01:49:48.039
All columnists should be
beaten to a pulp

01:49:48.123 --> 01:49:50.082
and converted back into paper.

01:49:50.167 --> 01:49:51.250
Did you plant this?

01:49:51.335 --> 01:49:54.587
Me? I thought it was common
knowledge about you and Sabrina.

01:49:55.506 --> 01:49:58.132
Who is Sabrina?

01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:00.802
Our chauffeur's daughter,
that's who she is.

01:50:00.886 --> 01:50:02.386
Now, how about that, gentlemen?

01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:05.515
Linus Larrabee, wizard of finance,
man of distinction,

01:50:05.599 --> 01:50:07.225
chairman of the board
of Larrabee Industries

01:50:07.309 --> 01:50:10.019
getting mixed up with
his chauffeur's daughter.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.437
That's enough, David.

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:14.649
She went after me for a while,
but then she switched to Linus.

01:50:14.733 --> 01:50:17.610
I guess it's because
he's got more money.

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:19.445
Now, we all know about
those kind of girls.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.073
And, believe me, gentlemen,
this one is no different.

01:50:22.157 --> 01:50:25.117
- Just seems to be.
- I've said that's enough.

01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:28.204
Maybe you got smart, Linus,
or maybe you just got lucky,

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:31.707
because you're here
and she's out there.

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:34.752
Brother, she would have
taken you for plenty.

01:50:39.216 --> 01:50:41.926
I was just helping you
make up your mind.

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:43.427
You are in love with her.

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:49.392
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:50:51.562 --> 01:50:53.896
There's an elevator outside,
a police escort downstairs,

01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:57.775
and a tugboat standing by
at the Larrabee pier.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.152
Get moving!

01:51:00.237 --> 01:51:01.737
Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

01:51:01.822 --> 01:51:05.199
it appears I have
a previous engagement.

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:07.285
That's the 20th century for you,

01:51:07.369 --> 01:51:10.913
automobiles, garages,
chauffeurs, chauffeurs' daughters!

01:51:16.253 --> 01:51:18.379
Inasmuch as I seem
to be the only member

01:51:18.463 --> 01:51:21.465
of the Larrabee family
who is not completely out of his mind,

01:51:21.633 --> 01:51:25.136
I will take it upon myself
to call this meeting back to order

01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:28.598
as soon as David Larrabee
removes his carcass from this table.

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:31.642
Sit down, Father.

01:51:34.646 --> 01:51:36.063
The olives.

01:52:25.781 --> 01:52:27.365
Miss Fairchild?
