<i>This story is inspired by real events
in France in the late 19th century.</i>

02:27.063 --> 02:28.773
Welcome, my lovely.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.734
You are very pretty.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.350
<i>- What?
- Come and see.</i>

03:08.355 --> 03:09.189
<i>Look.</i>

03:22.911 --> 03:24.371
<i>You watch her.</i>

03:25.955 --> 03:27.374
<i>Who is it?</i>

04:37.902 --> 04:39.654
How did she get up there?

04:39.863 --> 04:42.699
She climbs trees
when we are not looking.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.870
- How do you get her down?
- We wait till she comes down.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.585
Sister Marguerite,
how are you feeling today?

04:54.336 --> 04:55.211
Very well.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.882
Then climb up there
and bring that young girl down.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.111
Bring her down!

06:51.745 --> 06:56.124
We educate young deaf girls,
not blind and deaf.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.502
We couldn at look after her properly.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.049
What can I do?
Only the asylum will have her.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.717
I am sorry.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.352
<i>May 10.</i>

07:15.518 --> 07:18.063
<i>Today I met a soul.</i>

07:18.229 --> 07:20.440
<i>A tiny little soul, quite fragile.</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:22.067
<i>An imprisoned soul</i>

07:22.484 --> 07:26.529
<i>that I saw shine brightly
through her prison bars.</i>

07:26.696 --> 07:29.491
<i>I had thought she was a savage,</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:31.701
<i>a little animal.</i>

07:34.037 --> 07:36.414
<i>But she was waiting for me
in that tree.</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:42.379
<i>The girl is locked in a world
of darkness and silence.</i>

07:42.545 --> 07:45.548
<i>How can we talk to her?
Listen to her?</i>

07:47.384 --> 07:51.971
<i>What is it like to live
in total darkness and silence?</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:10.407
<i>Tighter!</i>

08:11.408 --> 08:12.659
<i>That as good.</i>

08:58.788 --> 09:01.374
Education wasn at my choice

09:01.541 --> 09:03.877
and I prefer manual work,

09:04.127 --> 09:08.506
but I met this young girl
and can at stop thinking about her.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.469
- You have never taught deaf girls.
- I speak their language.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.264
Getting them to break the silence
is another matter.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.476
- And she as blind.
- Let me try.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.894
I had a revelation.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.896
A revelation?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.815
No, not a revelation.
I mean...

09:25.982 --> 09:28.401
Just an idea. A simple idea.

09:29.277 --> 09:33.865
Unless I am wrong,
my mission is to look after her.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.410
To give her speech
so she may enter the world.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.953
No.

09:39.162 --> 09:39.996
But...

09:40.163 --> 09:43.958
I listened. You asked a question.
The answer is no.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.631
Thank you, Mother.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.180
But she can at stay locked
in her prison!

09:57.347 --> 09:59.766
Someone must teach her to talk.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.227
- How?
- Sign language.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.229
She as blind!

10:04.562 --> 10:06.189
I all make signs in her hand.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.859
It as from birth.
Her intelligence has shriveled.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.697
If it as intact, she must suffer
from being imprisoned.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.533
If there as even a tiny chance...

10:16.700 --> 10:20.453
It as quite a task.
With your health...

10:20.704 --> 10:23.039
My lungs will be the death of me.
Till then...

10:23.206 --> 10:27.085
It as a miracle you are alive.
No, not a miracle...

10:31.881 --> 10:35.969
The slightest sustained effort
could be fatal.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.306
I could die
shut away in a bedroom.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.392
I might as well stop living.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.438
Am I the Mother Superior
of this institution?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.564
Yes, Mother.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.275
- So must you obey me?
- Of course.

10:50.442 --> 10:54.446
If I say no, must you accept it
without argument?

11:07.083 --> 11:07.917
<i>May 27.</i>

11:08.168 --> 11:10.253
<i>I am off to fetch little Marie.</i>

11:10.378 --> 11:13.965
<i>I am almost as excited
as the day I took my vows.</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:56.424
Anyone there?

12:48.893 --> 12:50.562
It as me.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.553
But...

13:23.803 --> 13:25.597
Who are you?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.725
I ave come...

13:29.642 --> 13:31.061
to help you.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.155
Does she have no shoes?

13:42.322 --> 13:46.076
We never managed to put them on.
Nor dress her.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.663
Wait!

13:52.749 --> 13:54.209
I almost forgot.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.882
This knife is her favorite object.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.844
She prefers that to dolls.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.898
You all have to leave her now.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.323
I know.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.250
Go on.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.600
Go! Go!

17:37.140 --> 17:38.641
You.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.020
You.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.193
Me.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.655
Both of us.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.869
Together.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.826
Cow.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.664
Cow.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.046
Cow.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.009
There, look.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.720
That as a cow.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.982
<i>Look.</i>

21:56.983 --> 21:58.360
<i>Look at her hair!</i>

23:13.852 --> 23:15.895
You go there.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.106
There.

23:18.982 --> 23:22.235
That as for you.
It as your bed. Where you sleep.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.739
Here. OK?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.575
I all be back.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.452
You stay here.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.162
I all be back.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.876
<i>I all fetch her sheets.</i>

23:40.170 --> 23:43.006
<i>She as a new girl.
Be nice to her.</i>

23:43.173 --> 23:45.258
<i>You look after her.</i>

23:45.425 --> 23:46.468
<i>I all be back.</i>

24:50.657 --> 24:51.658
Bed!

24:58.665 --> 25:00.083
<i>Stop messing around!</i>

25:00.208 --> 25:01.876
<i>I trusted you.</i>

25:02.085 --> 25:03.670
You are all very naughty.

25:03.837 --> 25:07.298
<i>I all tell Mother Superior.
It all all end in tears.</i>

25:07.465 --> 25:09.592
<i>I am disappointed. It as wrong!</i>

25:15.181 --> 25:17.559
Hush. It as me.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.604
It as me. There.

25:21.855 --> 25:26.901
â€œWhen this discourse had lasted
for the space of two miles...

25:30.196 --> 25:32.699
â€œBrother Leo questioned him

25:32.949 --> 25:37.787
â€œsaying: â€˜Father, I pray thee,

25:38.038 --> 25:41.291
â€œâ€˜teach me wherein is perfect joy. aâ€

25:42.459 --> 25:43.585
Mother!

25:44.377 --> 25:45.920
Carry on.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.716
â€œAnd Saint Francis replied:

25:49.883 --> 25:52.344
â€œâ€˜If, when we shall arrive... aâ€

25:52.510 --> 25:54.054
Leave me.

25:54.220 --> 25:58.725
â€œâ€˜...drenched with rain
and trembling with cold,

â€œâ€˜exhausted by hunger,

â€œâ€˜and if, when we knock
at the convent gate,

26:05.273 --> 26:08.610
â€œâ€˜the porter should come angrily,

26:08.818 --> 26:11.071
â€œâ€˜and ask us who we are aâ€

26:11.237 --> 26:13.823
â€œâ€˜and we tell him... aâ€

26:16.951 --> 26:20.622
â€œâ€˜...and he answer:
â€˜That is not the truth,

26:20.830 --> 26:25.960
â€œâ€˜ye are two imposters
who take away the alms of the poor.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.754
â€œâ€˜Begone! a

26:30.090 --> 26:34.719
â€œâ€˜Then if we accept with patience

â€œâ€˜and without murmuring

26:37.514 --> 26:39.057
â€œâ€˜so much injustice... aâ€

26:39.224 --> 26:40.183
Hot.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.769
Hot.

26:42.936 --> 26:46.606
â€œâ€˜...believing with humility

26:46.773 --> 26:48.441
â€œâ€˜and charity... aâ€

26:58.535 --> 27:00.203
â€œâ€˜O, Brother Leo,

27:12.340 --> 27:13.258
<i>July 26.</i>

27:13.425 --> 27:16.011
<i>Each has her cross to bear.</i>

27:16.219 --> 27:19.597
<i>Right now my life with Marie
is an ordeal.</i>

27:19.764 --> 27:22.225
<i>What path should I take?</i>

27:27.814 --> 27:28.940
<i>September 20.</i>

27:29.107 --> 27:31.317
<i>I ave had Marie for four months.</i>

27:31.484 --> 27:33.361
<i>Her language isn at advancing.</i>

27:33.570 --> 27:36.573
<i>She behaves like a wild animal.</i>

28:05.935 --> 28:07.312
It as me.

28:21.117 --> 28:23.203
Wait, wait...

28:25.288 --> 28:26.289
Wait, look.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.759
Knife.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.971
That as your knife.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.348
It as your knife.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.016
Look.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.643
Your knife!

28:57.529 --> 28:58.363
<i>October 27.</i>

28:58.822 --> 29:00.657
<i>Still no progress.</i>

29:00.782 --> 29:03.660
<i>Marie has gone downhill
since she as been here.</i>

29:03.827 --> 29:05.328
<i>It as only natural.</i>

29:05.495 --> 29:08.373
<i>I took away her parents, her home,</i>

29:08.540 --> 29:10.667
<i>the little she knew.</i>

29:12.335 --> 29:14.504
<i>I dragged her out of her world.</i>

Pane.

Window.

31:19.713 --> 31:22.340
<i>Stop criticizing me.
You are annoying.</i>

31:22.507 --> 31:24.009
<i>Wait...</i>

31:24.175 --> 31:27.929
<i>I lived in silence until I was 4.</i>

31:28.138 --> 31:30.724
<i>My parents didn at know sign language,</i>

31:30.890 --> 31:32.642
<i>but they taught me the rest.</i>

<i>What â€œrestâ€</i>

31:34.102 --> 31:34.894
Everything.

31:35.061 --> 31:39.190
<i>Politeness, behavior,
table manners...</i>

31:39.357 --> 31:42.068
<i>She must learn to live with others.</i>

31:42.235 --> 31:44.237
<i>She isn at alone.</i>

31:44.487 --> 31:46.614
<i>You are right.
I am educating her badly.</i>

31:53.329 --> 31:57.250
<i>Maybe you were wrong
but you can do better.</i>

31:57.417 --> 31:59.502
<i>I ave no courage left.</i>

31:59.669 --> 32:02.380
<i>All this work for nothing.</i>

32:03.214 --> 32:05.091
<i>Till now, you...</i>

32:05.258 --> 32:08.219
<i>You taught me sign language.

Drop it.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.469
Yes...

There, you see?

35:26.459 --> 35:27.419
There?

35:57.907 --> 35:59.159
Yes.

46:21.448 --> 46:24.367
No, no sleeping.
No sleeping. Come on!

46:24.534 --> 46:26.244
Come on now.

46:26.411 --> 46:27.746
Knife.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.041
No sleeping, I said.
Wake up!

46:31.166 --> 46:32.792
Come on, knife!

46:32.959 --> 46:34.377
Knife!

46:35.045 --> 46:37.047
No, do â€œknifeâ€

46:45.722 --> 46:47.307
Knife.

46:53.521 --> 46:54.939
Knife.

47:09.329 --> 47:11.414
Knife.

47:21.174 --> 47:22.759
Knife.

47:56.501 --> 47:58.128
Knife.

48:05.552 --> 48:07.012
Knife.

48:21.484 --> 48:23.319
Knife.

49:18.249 --> 49:19.793
Yes...

49:19.959 --> 49:21.252
Yes!

49:23.421 --> 49:24.798
Yes!

49:26.383 --> 49:27.884
Knife!

49:40.063 --> 49:42.399
That as it! Knife!

49:47.070 --> 49:48.655
Mother!

49:50.365 --> 49:51.950
Mother!

49:53.243 --> 49:56.246
Mother, you must come.

49:56.413 --> 49:59.666
- Come where?
- Come and see Marie.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.085
She as been here eight months, no?

50:02.252 --> 50:03.461
Yes, and...

50:04.587 --> 50:06.965
- I find you admirable.
- Oh?

50:07.132 --> 50:08.758
So much effort, so few results...

50:08.925 --> 50:12.345
I have results.
Marie has made incredible progress.

50:12.595 --> 50:14.347
You must come and see.

50:16.933 --> 50:18.601
Look.

50:28.945 --> 50:29.946
That as it!

50:30.196 --> 50:31.281
What is?

50:31.448 --> 50:34.117
There!
She as signing the word â€œknifeâ€

50:38.204 --> 50:39.664
Yes.

50:51.176 --> 50:52.010
She as asking...

50:53.345 --> 50:56.890
â€œforkâ€

50:58.767 --> 51:01.061
That as the sign for â€œforkâ€

51:02.979 --> 51:03.813
Yes.

51:07.567 --> 51:09.486
Yes.

51:14.991 --> 51:16.868
Bread.

51:17.035 --> 51:18.453
Bread.

51:21.039 --> 51:22.665
Bread.

51:24.167 --> 51:26.127
That as it. That as it.

51:30.090 --> 51:31.091
Did you see?

51:32.342 --> 51:33.677
It works.

51:34.260 --> 51:35.095
It works.

51:37.013 --> 51:38.515
It works!

51:52.153 --> 51:53.738
Carrot.

51:55.699 --> 51:56.616
Carrot.

51:58.451 --> 51:59.619
There...

52:01.579 --> 52:03.039
Carrot.

52:08.712 --> 52:10.130
Apple.

52:18.179 --> 52:19.764
Grape.

52:36.948 --> 52:38.616
Yes, like that.

52:39.284 --> 52:40.869
Same for the other.

52:51.421 --> 52:52.756
Leaf.

52:59.012 --> 53:01.681
<i>June 15.
I am witnessing a wonderful show,</i>

53:01.848 --> 53:03.850
<i>an explosion of language.</i>

53:04.017 --> 53:06.644
<i>It was so hard
to learn the first word</i>

53:06.811 --> 53:10.148
<i>but the following words
are patently simple.</i>

53:10.315 --> 53:11.149
Donkey.

53:11.316 --> 53:12.942
<i>Marie wants to name everything.</i>

53:13.109 --> 53:14.527
Old...

53:14.694 --> 53:17.447
<i>Next we all be seeing adjectives,
sentences,</i>

53:17.614 --> 53:19.324
<i>grammar, abstract words.</i>

53:19.491 --> 53:20.784
Young.

53:22.827 --> 53:26.331
<i>I hope to live long enough
to see all that.</i>

53:42.180 --> 53:43.848
<i>Are they coming?</i>

53:44.015 --> 53:45.892
<i>Not yet.</i>

53:46.059 --> 53:47.477
<i>When?</i>

53:47.644 --> 53:50.063
<i>Soon.</i>

53:52.065 --> 53:53.900
<i>It as a long time.</i>

53:54.067 --> 53:55.735
<i>Patience.</i>

54:18.299 --> 54:20.176
<i>They are coming.</i>

54:20.343 --> 54:22.303
<i>Can they see me?</i>

54:23.513 --> 54:26.391
<i>Not yet.</i>

54:38.319 --> 54:41.531
<i>They can see you.</i>

55:08.641 --> 55:11.144
What are you waiting for?
Help me down.

55:11.811 --> 55:13.229
Help me down.

55:23.156 --> 55:25.241
<i>Go to them.</i>

55:59.275 --> 56:02.612
What are you waiting for?
She as your daughter.

57:21.024 --> 57:23.526
She says she as learning the alphabet

57:23.693 --> 57:24.819
and also...

57:26.780 --> 57:28.114
the spelling of words.

57:32.702 --> 57:35.038
How do we say â€œhelloâ€

58:34.097 --> 58:35.473
My little girl...

58:44.607 --> 58:45.984
â€œMommyâ€

58:46.776 --> 58:48.319
How do we say â€œMommyâ€

59:15.597 --> 59:17.307
- Like this?
- Yes.

59:38.161 --> 59:40.497
She says she is happy.

59:42.207 --> 59:44.834
And... she loves you.

01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:57.092
Can nothing be done?

01:01:59.302 --> 01:02:02.180
Rest, mainly.

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:04.349
And the mountain air.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.979
We won at tell Marie you are leaving.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.774
It would hurt her too much.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:30.203
â€œThe men with him
were dumbfounded half-wits,

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:33.790
â€œhearing the voice
but seeing nobody.

01:04:33.915 --> 01:04:37.836
â€œSaul got up and,
although his eyes were opened,

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:40.213
â€œhe could see nothing.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.299
â€œHe was led to Damascus...â€

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.844
<i>Please eat.</i>

01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:47.262
<i>No.</i>

01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:55.020
â€œIn Damascus, there was
a disciple named Ananius...â€

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:15.749
<i>It as me, RaphaÃ«lle.</i>

01:05:19.502 --> 01:05:21.838
<i>You must eat.</i>

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:16.995
No, sister. The journey
would worsen your condition

01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:19.831
and you might...
- I all die in the end.

01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:21.124
As will we all.

01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:23.793
But I all probably go long before you.

01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:31.134
I want to finish my task before I go.

01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:38.641
Just find me a remedy
to get me through the trip.

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:43.313
<i>I am so happy.</i>

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:45.315
<i>I will see Marie again.</i>

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.858
<i>She is my joy,</i>

01:07:47.859 --> 01:07:49.527
<i>the daughter of my soul,</i>

01:07:50.737 --> 01:07:52.530
<i>the light of my life.</i>

01:08:30.734 --> 01:08:32.278
It as me.

01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:52.776
<i>What as wrong?</i>

01:09:53.902 --> 01:09:55.904
<i>Sister Elisabeth has died.</i>

01:09:56.112 --> 01:09:57.864
<i>- When?
- Just now.</i>

01:09:58.031 --> 01:09:59.824
<i>She was working
in the garden.</i>

01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:02.786
<i>She said she felt hot,
and then died.</i>

01:10:57.507 --> 01:11:00.051
<i>Sister Elisabeth is broken?</i>

01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:03.847
<i>No. Her body is broken.</i>

01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:07.350
<i>She is dead.</i>

01:11:18.028 --> 01:11:21.531
<i>You and I are the opposite.
We are alive.</i>

01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:27.847
<i>I am going to die too.</i>

01:12:29.307 --> 01:12:31.184
<i>When?</i>

01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:35.063
<i>Soon.</i>

01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:37.315
<i>I forbid you to die.</i>

01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:41.361
<i>I can at decide that.
Neither can you.</i>

01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:44.155
<i>- Who decides?
- God.</i>

01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:48.785
<i>Who is God? Where is He?
I can at touch Him.</i>

01:12:53.665 --> 01:12:55.500
<i>He is everywhere.</i>

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.377
Here, here, here...

01:12:58.169 --> 01:13:01.965
<i>Even inside you.</i>

01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:58.688
<i>April 20.</i>

01:13:58.855 --> 01:14:01.066
<i>Marie gave me so many things.</i>

01:14:01.232 --> 01:14:05.236
<i>She introduced me to a world
I knew nothing about.</i>

01:14:05.695 --> 01:14:07.781
<i>A world you can touch,</i>

01:14:08.823 --> 01:14:12.702
<i>where everything that is alive
pulsates under your fingers.</i>

01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:58.123
<i>They are beautiful.</i>

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:14.014
<i>There are lots of them.</i>

01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:37.639
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:16:37.847 --> 01:16:39.683
<i>Yes.</i>

01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:45.438
<i>Would you like a drink?</i>

01:16:48.024 --> 01:16:49.984
<i>Yes.</i>

01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:36.948
<i>Careful, it as hot.</i>

01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:06.311
<i>You want a drink?</i>

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.938
<i>No.</i>

01:19:34.024 --> 01:19:35.775
Help.

01:20:08.558 --> 01:20:10.060
<i>I won at let her come in.</i>

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.228
<i>But she needs to see you.</i>

01:20:14.105 --> 01:20:17.108
<i>I didn at ask your opinion.</i>

01:20:42.175 --> 01:20:44.511
<i>I want to come in, please.</i>

01:20:44.678 --> 01:20:48.098
<i>Marguerite is tired.
She is resting.</i>

01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:49.474
<i>I want to go in.</i>

01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:51.184
<i>I said no.</i>

01:20:51.434 --> 01:20:52.977
<i>I want to go in!</i>

01:20:53.144 --> 01:20:55.230
<i>Patience. Later.</i>

01:21:22.132 --> 01:21:23.883
What about little Marie?

01:21:25.218 --> 01:21:27.345
She wasn at seen at lunch.

01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:30.974
Where has she got to?

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:33.143
We ave been looking all day.

01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:39.190
We looked everywhere.

01:21:40.692 --> 01:21:41.860
Look in the trees.

01:21:58.001 --> 01:21:59.044
<i>It as dangerous.</i>

01:22:00.628 --> 01:22:04.341
Oh, I am still capable
of climbing a ladder!

01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:50.095
Come on.

01:22:50.345 --> 01:22:52.555
<i>I want to see Marguerite.</i>

01:22:52.681 --> 01:22:57.018
<i>I want to see Marguerite
before she dies.</i>

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:05.568
Before taking the orders myself,

01:23:05.735 --> 01:23:09.823
I thought the people of the Church
left this world peacefully,

01:23:09.989 --> 01:23:11.449
in serenity.

01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:15.912
Since then I ave seen
several sisters die,

01:23:16.037 --> 01:23:17.288
a few priests...

01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:20.417
Some allay suspicion.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:23.920
With more or less skill,
they pretend...

01:23:24.087 --> 01:23:27.257
they are happy to join their Maker.

01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:29.259
But I ave never been fooled.

01:23:32.595 --> 01:23:36.599
I felt the revolt
clinging to their bodies.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:42.147
I suppose I all go that way too.

01:23:46.609 --> 01:23:49.195
We devoted ourselves to God.

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:53.283
Our whole life is a rebellion.

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:55.827
We rebel against evil,

01:23:55.994 --> 01:23:57.620
against the world,

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:01.082
against ourselves.

01:24:04.794 --> 01:24:09.299
Why won at you talk to the girl
one last time?

01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:14.304
I am not ready.

01:24:19.559 --> 01:24:22.020
You ave no more time to get ready.

01:24:23.813 --> 01:24:26.191
But she is ready.

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:28.902
You worked well.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.740
She knows you will leave her.
She has accepted it.

01:24:35.158 --> 01:24:36.493
But you haven at.

01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:39.871
You haven at accepted leaving her.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:46.127
Yes.

01:25:40.056 --> 01:25:44.060
<i>Will you carry on learning?</i>

01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:48.398
<i>Yes.</i>

01:25:53.653 --> 01:26:00.326
<i>I won at be there to help you.</i>

01:26:04.748 --> 01:26:09.961
<i>The other sisters will take over.</i>

01:26:49.167 --> 01:26:50.710
Live!

01:26:50.877 --> 01:26:53.004
You must live!

01:28:57.962 --> 01:29:02.300
<i>Sister Marguerite,
I often think of you.</i>

01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:05.637
<i>All day I think of you.</i>

01:29:05.804 --> 01:29:08.640
<i>In the morning, when I wake,
I think of you.</i>

01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:12.602
<i>At night, as I go to sleep,
I think of you.</i>

01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:18.108
<i>When I learn something new,
I think of you.</i>

01:29:20.777 --> 01:29:25.031
<i>So far I have learned
a great many things.</i>

01:29:32.664 --> 01:29:36.668
<i>When you see me from heaven,
I hope you are proud of me.</i>

01:29:38.336 --> 01:29:43.717
<i>A new little girl arrived today.</i>

01:29:44.634 --> 01:29:49.014
<i>She as like me.
Deaf and blind.</i>

01:29:50.306 --> 01:29:55.061
<i>But she as different from me
when I arrived.</i>

01:29:55.228 --> 01:29:57.397
<i>She doesn at shout.</i>

01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:59.441
<i>She doesn at move.</i>

01:29:59.649 --> 01:30:02.527
<i>She smells nice.</i>

01:30:03.862 --> 01:30:07.574
<i>She smells of bread.</i>

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:13.580
<i>She as waiting.
What is she waiting for?</i>

01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:17.500
<i>She as waiting for the word.</i>

01:30:18.877 --> 01:30:23.715
<i>The sisters will teach her,</i>

01:30:23.882 --> 01:30:27.469
<i>like you taught me.</i>

01:30:27.677 --> 01:30:30.889
<i>I shall help them.</i>

01:30:33.224 --> 01:30:38.438
<i>I hope we all become friends.</i>

01:30:40.106 --> 01:30:44.569
<i>You and I were more than friends.</i>

01:30:49.908 --> 01:30:53.953
<i>Marie Heurtin lived for the rest
of her life at Notre-Dame de Larnay,</i>

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.374
