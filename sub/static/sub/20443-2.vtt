WEBVTT

00:11.971 --> 00:13.890
Shadow,
we're gonna be releasing you

00:14.057 --> 00:15.392
later this afternoon.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.018
Your wife...

00:19.104 --> 00:20.980
..she died in the early hours
of this morning.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.942
It was a...
an automobile accident.

00:26.027 --> 00:29.864
You lost something
vital in there, not just time.

00:32.242 --> 00:34.577
If I was inclined,
what might I call you?

00:36.955 --> 00:40.041
I could be Mr Wednesday
with a shake of the hand.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.210
How much has our man told you?

00:44.796 --> 00:46.464
You're my man now.

00:46.631 --> 00:49.718
Do you know who he is?
Who he really is?

04:42.116 --> 04:43.701
Oh, she long dead.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.751
She wouldn't give it up
for Hannes up there,

04:51.918 --> 04:54.587
so he threw her off the boat.

04:55.630 --> 04:57.173
Did you know your momma
couldn't swim?

04:58.216 --> 05:00.468
You all need to work on that.

05:00.635 --> 05:04.347
Take swimming lessons.
This is how we get stereotypes.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.892
Anansi.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.186
You want help?

05:10.353 --> 05:12.438
Fine.

05:12.605 --> 05:15.316
Let me tell you a story.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.652
"Once upon a time,

05:17.819 --> 05:21.072
"a man got fucked."

05:21.239 --> 05:24.200
Now how is that for a story?

05:24.367 --> 05:28.663
'Cause that's the story
of black people in America.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.958
Shit.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.168
You all don't know
you black yet.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.005
You think you just people.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.798
Let me be the first
to tell you

05:38.965 --> 05:42.051
that you are all black.

05:42.218 --> 05:44.971
The moment these Dutch
motherfuckers set foot here

05:45.138 --> 05:46.848
and decided they white

05:47.015 --> 05:48.850
and you get to be black

05:49.017 --> 05:51.436
and that's the nice name
they call you...

05:52.478 --> 05:54.272
Let me paint a picture

05:54.439 --> 05:57.567
of what's waiting for you
on the shore.

05:57.734 --> 06:00.653
You arrives in America,

06:00.820 --> 06:03.948
land of opportunity,
milk and honey,

06:04.115 --> 06:05.700
and guess what.

06:05.867 --> 06:08.619
You all get to be slaves.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.872
Split up, sold off

06:11.039 --> 06:13.207
and worked to death.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.626
The lucky ones get Sunday off

06:15.793 --> 06:17.462
to sleep and fuck
and make more slaves

06:17.628 --> 06:19.005
and all for what?

06:19.172 --> 06:20.590
For cotton?

06:20.757 --> 06:22.341
Indigo?

06:22.508 --> 06:25.094
For a fucking purple shirt?

06:27.055 --> 06:28.806
The ONLY good news is

06:28.973 --> 06:33.227
the tobacco your grandkids
are gonna farm for free is

06:33.394 --> 06:36.814
gonna give a shitload of
these white motherfuckers cancer.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.069
And I ain't even started yet.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.072
A hundred years later,

06:44.238 --> 06:46.115
you are fucked.

06:46.282 --> 06:49.535
A hundred years after that...

06:49.702 --> 06:51.412
..fucked.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.664
A hundred years
after you get free,

06:53.831 --> 06:56.375
you still getting
fucked out a job

06:56.542 --> 06:58.294
and shot at by police.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.046
You see what I'm saying?

07:03.508 --> 07:05.259
This guy gets it.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.554
I like him.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.432
He's getting angry.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.561
Angry is good.

07:17.855 --> 07:23.069
Angry...gets...shit...done.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.282
You shed tears
for Compe Anansi

07:28.449 --> 07:31.202
and here he is, telling you...

07:32.787 --> 07:36.040
..you are
staring down the barrel

07:36.207 --> 07:39.919
of 300 years of subjugation,

07:40.086 --> 07:43.631
racist bullshit
and heart disease.

07:43.798 --> 07:46.843
He is telling you

07:47.009 --> 07:49.345
there isn't one goddamn reason

07:49.512 --> 07:52.348
you shouldn't go up there
right now

07:52.515 --> 07:55.476
and slit the throats

07:55.643 --> 07:59.689
of every last one
of these Dutch motherfuckers

07:59.856 --> 08:03.526
and set fire to this ship!

08:17.498 --> 08:20.168
You already dead, asshole.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.503
At least die a sacrifice

08:22.670 --> 08:24.630
for something worthwhile.

08:27.091 --> 08:31.387
Let the motherfucker burn!

08:33.389 --> 08:37.351
Let it all...burn!

10:18.494 --> 10:20.663
Were you shot at?

10:20.830 --> 10:22.206
No.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.300
If you were,
I have to call the cops.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.884
No.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.470
No. No cops.

10:46.439 --> 10:48.357
The fuck you do?

10:49.692 --> 10:51.319
Why, it depends
on who you ask.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.945
You ask the girl's mother,

10:53.112 --> 10:55.364
she'll say I did a series
of unspeakable things.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.200
You ask that mouth-breather
she calls her boyfriend,

10:58.367 --> 10:59.744
he'll be at a loss for words.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.287
But you ask the girl herself,

11:01.454 --> 11:03.331
I'm guessing she'll say
I opened a few doors.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.499
Come on, ask her yourself.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.548
Well?

11:12.715 --> 11:15.301
I'm asking you what do you know
about a slaughtered lynch mob?

11:16.385 --> 11:18.971
I don't know
what the fuck you speak of.

11:19.138 --> 11:21.599
I was merely passing the time
as instinct indicated,

11:21.766 --> 11:23.184
while you were paying
your last respects

11:23.351 --> 11:24.727
to your dearly departed.

11:24.894 --> 11:26.354
How was the funeral?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.565
It's over.

11:29.732 --> 11:32.401
- Do you want to talk about it?
- You just...just...

11:32.568 --> 11:33.903
Jeez, you fuck.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.279
Hey. Hey.

11:35.446 --> 11:36.864
Hey, you...you hungry?

11:37.031 --> 11:38.324
I mean, they got no food here,

11:38.491 --> 11:40.868
but you can order a pizza
and put it on the room.

11:41.035 --> 11:44.205
Look, I'm not fucking hungry! OK?

11:44.372 --> 11:46.457
I was just hijacked
by a toad skin smoking punk

11:46.624 --> 11:47.917
in a virtual fucking limo.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.043
Oh.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.544
Said to tell you
he's reprogrammed reality.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.839
Mm, mm, mm.
What a little asshole!

11:54.882 --> 11:57.301
- Oh, you know him?
- Oh, I know who he is.

11:58.344 --> 12:01.680
They don't have a clue.
They don't have a fucking clue!

12:01.847 --> 12:03.140
I don't have a fucking clue. OK?

12:03.307 --> 12:05.559
I don't give a fuck
if they don't have a fucking clue.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.686
I want one.
Give me a fucking clue.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.939
Clues were not
in the agreement.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.941
Oh, neither was my ass
hanging from a fucking tree.

12:12.108 --> 12:13.401
I was lynched.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.902
Strange fucking fruit.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.238
Plucked...plucky fruit.
Here you stand.

12:17.405 --> 12:19.407
Unusual outcome
for a lynching.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.410
Chalk it all up
to occupational hazard.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.578
And occupational hazard
gets hazard pay.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.622
Double your salary. That do it?

12:30.418 --> 12:32.002
- It'll do something.
- Good.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.629
Compact amended.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.756
How much longer
you gonna be in this town?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.092
I don't know.
Maybe another day.

12:38.259 --> 12:41.053
Alright. You're done here,
we're done here.

12:41.220 --> 12:45.141
Goodnight. Your first bed
as a free man. Enjoy it.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.357
Shadow?

12:58.904 --> 13:01.615
About that little shit
in the big limo.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.202
An assault on you
is an insult to me.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.288
Don't think because
I didn't lose my temper

13:07.455 --> 13:11.375
I'm not angry
or I'm lacking a plan.

14:44.385 --> 14:46.387
I didn't mean to wake you.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.350
Laura.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.520
They told me you died.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.566
Who said I died, puppy?

15:00.526 --> 15:02.069
Everyone.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.407
Oh, you were just
having a bad dream.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.427
You going to miss it?

20:22.014 --> 20:23.515
Eagle Point?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.685
No.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.521
Too many Laura memories.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.773
Never really had a life here.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.860
It's Laura's town.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.324
Too many people tell each other

20:40.490 --> 20:42.910
not to repress their emotions,

20:43.076 --> 20:45.662
to release their feelings,
to let the pain go.

20:45.829 --> 20:48.457
There's a lot to be said
for bottling up emotions.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.128
I'm gonna tell you something

20:53.295 --> 20:55.005
and you're gonna
want to hurt me.

20:55.172 --> 20:58.842
But what I say
has got to be said.

20:59.009 --> 21:02.304
So I want you to consider
my words very carefully

21:02.471 --> 21:05.974
and refrain
from knocking my teeth out.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.395
Say it.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.022
Word on the street is

21:12.189 --> 21:15.484
your wife died sucking
your best friend's cock.

21:15.651 --> 21:19.279
And you, sir, are only obligated
to feel bad about that

21:19.446 --> 21:21.698
for so long.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.167
Thank you...

21:34.086 --> 21:36.046
..for warning me.

♪ There's a place up ahead... ♪

22:09.997 --> 22:11.289
Why coin tricks?

22:11.456 --> 22:14.584
You don't really have the personality
to be a magician.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.588
You can't weave the stories
that are necessary for belief

22:18.755 --> 22:20.257
unless you have
a little personality.

22:20.424 --> 22:21.508
Wow.

22:23.802 --> 22:25.804
- You do have craft, though.
- Thank you.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.431
Turn off here.

22:28.432 --> 22:30.183
No, the highway's ahead.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.103
We're not taking the highway.
Not now, not ever.

22:33.270 --> 22:36.857
- No highways.
- OK, OK, no highways.

22:41.153 --> 22:44.197
- Why no highways?
- Seen one, seen 'em all.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.033
No chance
for serendipitous lovely.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.076
Let there be beauty
where there can be.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.078
And keep her under 70,
would you, huh?

22:50.245 --> 22:53.081
- Betty likes a slow ride.
- So what's the plan?

22:53.248 --> 22:56.084
Plan is we will be meeting
with a number of people

22:56.251 --> 22:58.170
preeminent
in their respective fields.

22:58.336 --> 22:59.713
And then we will rendezvous

22:59.880 --> 23:03.133
at one of the most important places
in the entire country.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.135
Where is the most important place
in the country?

23:05.302 --> 23:06.720
One of the most
important places.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.389
Opinion is justifiably varied.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.350
But we will be stopping
in Chicago first.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.478

23:54.643 --> 23:56.019
I've got a meeting in here

23:56.186 --> 23:58.146
and I want you
to do some shopping for me.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.857
Here's $1,000
and a list of things to get.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.527
Don't like dropping in on friends
empty-handed.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.779
Money situation's
a little tight at the moment,

24:05.946 --> 24:07.697
so we can agree now
you bring me receipts

24:07.864 --> 24:10.408
or you don't skim more
than a reasonable 5%.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.203
Oh... I'm not gonna
steal from you.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.788
You can't look out
for yourself,

24:14.955 --> 24:16.873
how the hell
you gonna look out for me?

25:02.711 --> 25:04.880
Not so fast.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.715
We need to talk, Shadow.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.635
Look at me, Shadow.
All in high-def.

25:10.802 --> 25:14.389
We shot the show in 35mm.
Cutting edge.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.850
Looks like hell
in the transfer.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.562
Funny how things supposed
to make you look good

25:20.729 --> 25:22.522
only make it worse.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.900
I can't even
fill the whole screen.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.288
What the fuck is this?

25:38.455 --> 25:40.540
Just little old me.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.548
I'm talking to Lucille Ball.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.091
Lucy Ricardo.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.052
I'm all sorts, Shadow.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.678
The screen's the altar.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.764
I'm the one they sacrifice to.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.265
Then till now.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.684
Golden age to golden age.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.811
They sit side by side,
ignore each other

26:01.978 --> 26:03.355
and give it up to me.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.190
Now they hold a smaller screen
in their lap

26:05.357 --> 26:06.733
or in the palm of their hand

26:06.900 --> 26:09.069
so they don't get bored
watching the big one.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.987
Time and attention -

26:11.154 --> 26:13.657
better than lamb's blood.

26:13.823 --> 26:14.866
Huh!

26:15.033 --> 26:17.869
They beat your pretty face
all up.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.412
I hate that.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.665
I hate that they were
hurting you, Shadow.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.792
I would never do that
to you, honey.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.795
No. I want to offer you a job.

26:26.962 --> 26:30.006
- Doing what?
- Working for me.

26:30.173 --> 26:33.885
I want you in my camp with us.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.637
Look at it like this, Shadow.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.681
We're the coming thing.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.432
We are already here.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.768
We are self-driving cars
and 3-D printers

26:41.935 --> 26:44.020
and subdermal
time-release insulin.

26:44.187 --> 26:47.774
Your old boss is still selling oranges
on the side of the road.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.776
Not even organic.

26:49.943 --> 26:53.113
We are now and tomorrow

26:53.280 --> 26:55.865
and tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.827
And he ain't even yesterday
anymore.

26:58.994 --> 27:01.663
I heard about the trouble
you had with the Technical Boy.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.833
I was impressed
with how you dealt with him.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.544
Efficient, no-nonsense,
effective.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.754
Who'd have thought
you had it in you?

27:09.921 --> 27:12.799
He was underestimating you,
sweetheart.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.467
They all are.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.845
Not a mistake I'll make.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.515
Yeah, well, I don't want
to work for you, 'I Love Lucy'.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.017
We're done.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.560
Whatever the old guys
are giving you,

27:23.727 --> 27:26.104
I can give you so much more.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.814
You name it, honey.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.524
What do you need?

27:29.691 --> 27:32.402
Hey, you ever wanted
to see Lucy's tits?

27:32.569 --> 27:35.196
Lucy!

27:38.116 --> 27:39.701
Don't fight gravity, Shadow.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.745
I've been at this a while.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.288
Not as long as some,

27:43.455 --> 27:44.914
but I've seen things.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.460
Guys like you
end up a suicide every time.

27:48.626 --> 27:53.506
I'm trying to help you
keep your neck out of the belt.

28:27.165 --> 28:30.126
That went as well
as can be expected.

28:30.293 --> 28:33.088
You all gassed up
and ready to go?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.508
I think I'm losing my mind.

28:36.674 --> 28:39.010
Well, when will you know
for sure?

28:39.177 --> 28:41.096
I've heard of guys losing it
when they get out.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.515
Are you trying to
wiggle your way out of this job?

28:43.681 --> 28:47.352
Lucy... 'I Love Lucy'
talked to me.

28:47.519 --> 28:48.895
Oh, the television program?

28:49.062 --> 28:51.022
No, Lucy herself came...

28:51.189 --> 28:54.150
- This is so fucking crazy.
- The rest of your life is sane?

28:54.317 --> 28:57.070
Lucy talking to me from the TV
is much, much weirder

28:57.237 --> 28:58.738
than anything
that's ever happened to me.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.365
So far.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.868
Oh, at times the universe does seem
to have singled you out

29:04.035 --> 29:05.620
for unique abuse.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.414
In these moments,
you got to ask yourself,

29:07.580 --> 29:09.833
"Would I rather be ignored?"

29:09.999 --> 29:11.376
Yes.

29:11.543 --> 29:12.961
OK, yes, ignore me.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.547
Always better dead
than forgotten.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.632
And no-one is ever
gonna forget you.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.843
Now, flattering as that may be,

29:20.009 --> 29:22.053
this, on top
of your other adventures, hm...

29:23.346 --> 29:25.223
A sudden onset of strange.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.935
Fair cause for consternation,
unless strange is a new language

29:29.102 --> 29:32.230
and what we're doing here
is vocabulary building.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.023
Fuck your vocabulary.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.984
OK? This is gibberish.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.986
Seems you have a choice.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.571
You may have to consider

29:39.737 --> 29:43.324
that you didn't see
what you saw.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.579
- Or...?
- Or you did.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.747
The world is either crazy
or you are.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.249
They're both solid options.
Take your pick.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.127
And when you decide,
come and tell me.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.629
But don't rush into it.
Take your time.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.673
Difficult decision.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.720
They threatened
to reprogram reality.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.432
I mean, is...
Is that what this is?

30:07.599 --> 30:08.933
Are they just
fucking with my head?

30:09.100 --> 30:10.727
Are you fucking with my head?

30:14.105 --> 30:16.232
There are bigger sacrifices

30:16.399 --> 30:19.277
one might be asked to make

30:19.444 --> 30:22.071
than going a little mad.

30:30.288 --> 30:32.373
Yeah, this is good.
This is very good.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.417
You can read a list. What...?

30:34.584 --> 30:37.045
What the hell is this?

30:38.254 --> 30:40.256
- You don't have one.
- I don't want one.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.967
Well, you need one. What if
someone wants to talk to you?

30:43.134 --> 30:45.011
Why the hell would I want
to talk to anyone?

30:45.178 --> 30:47.222
OK, what if I
need to talk to you, huh?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.641
- Try shouting.
- What...?

30:49.807 --> 30:52.519
Or in a pinch...

30:52.685 --> 30:54.062
..a telegram.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.813
Oh, you know, I miss those.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.149
Dots and dashes, secret code.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.692
There was drama in there.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.028
Someone gave you an envelope,
you got anticipation.

31:02.195 --> 31:04.697
What's in there?
So you'd open it very slowly.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.366
Every phrase chosen carefully,

31:06.533 --> 31:08.076
'cause they charge you
by the word.

31:08.243 --> 31:09.702
First wire ever sent,

31:09.869 --> 31:13.498
by Samuel F.B. Morse himself
in 1844.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.500
"What hath God wrought?"

31:15.667 --> 31:19.087
Goddamn information age
is what.

31:19.254 --> 31:22.382
Best thing about these states
we're headed towards,

31:22.549 --> 31:24.425
Minnesota, Wisconsin,

31:24.592 --> 31:26.386
is that they have
the kind of women

31:26.553 --> 31:28.346
that I loved
when I was younger.

31:28.513 --> 31:30.807
Pale-skinned, blue-eyed.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.101
Hair so fair
it's almost white.

31:33.268 --> 31:34.686
Wine-coloured lips,

31:34.852 --> 31:36.354
full round breasts

31:36.521 --> 31:39.607
with veins running through them
like a good cheese.

31:40.650 --> 31:43.736
Only when you were younger?
You did alright last night.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.865
You want to know the secret
of my success?

31:48.032 --> 31:49.826
The secret is charm.

31:49.993 --> 31:52.620
Yeah, well,
you either got it or you don't.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.248
Charms can be learned
like anything else.

32:00.378 --> 32:02.505
♪ Saw a room full of men

32:02.672 --> 32:04.841

36:59.385 --> 37:01.220
Zorya Vechernyaya.

37:02.430 --> 37:05.099
He don't going to be happy
to see you.

37:18.195 --> 37:20.531
Organic bullshit.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.336
Of course you come
after I do shopping.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.421
Now I have to send back to store

37:35.588 --> 37:37.465
to make enough for tonight
for supper.

37:37.632 --> 37:39.216
You bad news.

37:39.383 --> 37:42.053
I only come when matters are vital,
as they are now.

37:42.219 --> 37:45.806
God, you are gorgeous.

37:45.973 --> 37:47.725
You have not aged. Hm?

37:47.892 --> 37:50.603
And I brought you a present.

37:50.770 --> 37:54.315
And...for your sister.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.984
And for your sister.

38:06.202 --> 38:08.955
Zorya Ultrennyaya!

38:09.121 --> 38:10.498
She is awake.

38:10.665 --> 38:12.625
Our other sister
is still asleep.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.047
Something to warm
your bedside table.

38:18.214 --> 38:19.590
Our guests stay for dinner.

38:19.757 --> 38:21.133
Go back to store.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.261
A roast, six potatoes,
a rye loaf with seeds.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.180
No seeds, take the wheat.

38:26.347 --> 38:29.225
- I can help.
- You sit. You are guest.

38:29.392 --> 38:31.060
Coffee first.

38:32.853 --> 38:37.775
The Zorya sisters
always make a marvellous home.

38:37.942 --> 38:40.319
We do OK.
We pay rent on time even.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.780
We make some money
from the slaughterhouse.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.241
My sister and I make
a dollar here, a dollar there

38:45.408 --> 38:46.742
reading fortune.

38:46.909 --> 38:48.661
I make the most, of course.

38:48.828 --> 38:50.913
It's because you tell
the prettiest lies.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.040
The truth is not
what people want to hear.

38:53.207 --> 38:56.043
Prettiest woman,
prettiest lies.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.505
Oh, black as night,

38:59.672 --> 39:01.215
sweet as sin.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.847
You take coffee,
then I read your future.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.641
You want from me.
My sisters are garbage.

39:12.309 --> 39:15.187
You do not believe in fortunes.

39:16.272 --> 39:17.732
I think that...

39:17.898 --> 39:19.900
..we're all fucked
any way it comes out.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.444
You know? So...

39:21.610 --> 39:24.155
Seeing that before it happens
is just playing the odds.

39:25.614 --> 39:29.285
Ha! You go sit, be comfortable.

39:29.452 --> 39:31.328
Washroom is second door,
not third.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.205
The third you do not touch.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.166
My other sister
is sleeping inside.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.335
- She needs her rest.
- Is she sick?

39:45.426 --> 39:47.845
He does not know our world.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.848
I'm easing him in.

39:51.015 --> 39:53.517
You are worst man
I have ever seen.

40:34.892 --> 40:38.187
- That smell.
- We have guest.

40:38.354 --> 40:40.439
We have two guests.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.195
Oh. Votan!

40:46.362 --> 40:49.240
Nice to see you, Czernobog,
old friend.

40:49.406 --> 40:50.908
I brought a gift.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.499
Yeah?

41:00.876 --> 41:03.629
And some of that herb Havarti
you like so much.

41:03.796 --> 41:05.923
Why is he in my home?

41:06.090 --> 41:08.592
Make him not be here
or I make him not be here.

41:08.759 --> 41:11.637
I already invite him for dinner.
I cannot uninvite.

41:11.804 --> 41:14.348
I come here only to share
bread and information.

41:14.515 --> 41:17.476
What you choose to do with the latter
is entirely up to you.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.979
Already he's spitting on my rug.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.647
Just a few moments
of your time,

41:21.814 --> 41:23.858
while my man here
helps the ladies

41:24.024 --> 41:25.943
prepare a delicious meal,
I'm sure.

41:26.110 --> 41:28.195
For old times' sake.

41:30.364 --> 41:32.366
Hm?

41:37.288 --> 41:38.789
Make dinner first.

42:04.899 --> 42:07.818
- I'd be happy to help.
- I murder you first.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.447
Think your husband
might beat you to it.

42:11.614 --> 42:14.116
Czernobog is nobody's husband.
I'm nobody's wife.

42:14.283 --> 42:15.659
Relatives.

42:15.826 --> 42:18.704
We come over here together
long time ago.

42:18.871 --> 42:22.458
Family is who you survive with
when you need to survive.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.419
Even if you do not like them.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.340
Everything looks great.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.425
Meat will be tough,
potatoes will be soft.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.010
I am not a good cook.

42:33.177 --> 42:35.387
When I was young,
there were servants to make meals.

42:35.554 --> 42:37.056
Here, there are no servants.

42:37.223 --> 42:40.726
There's only us,
and learning is beneath me.

42:50.945 --> 42:52.696
Thought you were supposed
to read tea leaves.

42:52.863 --> 42:55.532
Tea is disgusting.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.750
So what does it say?

43:10.297 --> 43:12.424
You will have a long life

43:12.591 --> 43:15.427
and a happy one,
with many children.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.724
That bad, huh?
Any good news?

43:20.891 --> 43:23.310
Your mother die of cancer.

43:25.729 --> 43:27.147
Yeah.

43:27.314 --> 43:30.025
You no die of cancer.

43:34.989 --> 43:36.907
Can you get out?

43:37.074 --> 43:38.701
I want you to get out

43:38.867 --> 43:40.536
and take your man with you.

43:40.703 --> 43:42.830
- Or I will break him open...
- Shh!

43:42.997 --> 43:44.748
..and I will choke you slowly...

43:44.915 --> 43:47.251
- Shh!
- ..with his heart.

43:47.418 --> 43:48.669
I'm not going with you
anywhere!

43:48.836 --> 43:50.170
- Shh!
- What's the matter?

43:50.337 --> 43:53.841
Let her wake up -
let your sister hear this con man,

43:54.008 --> 43:55.926
this sonofabitch,
come into my home

43:56.093 --> 43:59.054
and try to make me die.

43:59.221 --> 44:01.557
You brought that madness
into my life once.

44:01.724 --> 44:04.852
- Never again.
- They'll all be there.

44:05.019 --> 44:09.189
Everyone except you.

44:09.356 --> 44:12.234
Each of them thinking
they know what strong is.

44:12.401 --> 44:15.446
And if you're not there
to show them otherwise...

44:15.612 --> 44:18.365
They respect you.

44:18.532 --> 44:21.577
- They KNOW you.
- No, no, they don't know me.

44:21.744 --> 44:24.121
YOU know me.

44:24.288 --> 44:26.790
You know
what these hands have done.

44:26.957 --> 44:29.376
You don't want me,
you want my brother

44:29.543 --> 44:31.462
and he's not here.

44:31.628 --> 44:33.130
Then we'll die.

44:34.256 --> 44:37.259
It will be glorious,
win or lose.

44:37.426 --> 44:39.970
I'm tired of glorious.

44:40.137 --> 44:41.722
Is something wrong?

44:41.889 --> 44:45.267
Nothing at all, my sister.
Go back to sleep.

44:45.434 --> 44:47.478
I'm not successful.

44:49.730 --> 44:53.233
- We should go.
- You said you needed him.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.943
- There's always another way.
- No, no.

44:55.110 --> 44:56.779
No, no. Food is cooked.

44:56.945 --> 45:01.033
Zorya Vechernyaya
invited you for dinner, right?

45:02.076 --> 45:04.370
So you stay and you eat.

45:04.536 --> 45:07.289
Otherwise, she will be insulted.

45:07.456 --> 45:09.416
You understand?

45:09.583 --> 45:11.293
And if you want to leave after,

45:11.460 --> 45:13.712
I will hold open the door.

45:24.807 --> 45:27.017
Mm! Mm...

45:28.268 --> 45:29.353
Mm.

45:30.479 --> 45:32.022
Mm.

45:33.732 --> 45:37.069
Mm. Mm! Delicious.

45:37.236 --> 45:40.948
To think I nearly missed
this fabulous meal, hm?

45:41.115 --> 45:43.659
Thank you, ladies. Shadow.

45:43.826 --> 45:45.661
My old friend, hm?

45:47.538 --> 45:48.705
Ah!

45:48.872 --> 45:50.541
You're black.

45:50.707 --> 45:52.584
Right?

45:54.711 --> 45:56.255
That a problem?

45:56.422 --> 46:01.176
Ehh, we never much care about skin
like the Americans.

46:01.343 --> 46:04.304
Where we're from,
everyone has the same colour,

46:04.471 --> 46:08.725
so we must fight over shades.

46:08.892 --> 46:10.394
Hm.

46:11.437 --> 46:14.940
You see, my brother
had light hair and beard.

46:15.107 --> 46:16.567
Me dark, like you.

46:16.733 --> 46:19.445
I was like the black man
over there.

46:20.487 --> 46:23.449
As against my brother,
the white.

46:25.159 --> 46:28.620
Everybody thought
he must be the good one.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.456
Yeah.

46:30.622 --> 46:33.459
So I became me.

46:33.625 --> 46:37.880
But time passes. Now I'm grey.

46:38.046 --> 46:42.092
Yeah, he too, I...
I believe now is grey.

46:42.259 --> 46:43.760
So you wouldn't be able
to tell

46:43.927 --> 46:47.431
who is light, who is dark.

46:47.598 --> 46:51.310
So much
for fighting over colour.

46:53.103 --> 46:57.232
Yeah, you see,
when we came to America,

46:57.399 --> 46:59.234
we first came to New York.

46:59.401 --> 47:01.695
Everyone first come to New York.

47:01.862 --> 47:04.364
New York was...
Yeah, it was alright.

47:04.531 --> 47:05.949
Sometimes even good, right? Eh?

47:06.116 --> 47:09.244
And then we came here, Chicago,
everything became bad.

47:11.413 --> 47:13.916
I think in old country,
you know, I am forgotten.

47:14.082 --> 47:16.710
Here, I'm like a bad memory.

47:16.877 --> 47:20.672
So I had to find work

47:20.839 --> 47:24.760
and I found meat business.

47:24.927 --> 47:27.513
- You know it?
- I know the eating part.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.556
I know the killing.

47:34.478 --> 47:38.106
So I got job on killing floor
as a knocker.

47:38.273 --> 47:40.025
It was a good job.

47:40.192 --> 47:42.277
Yeah, skilled labour.

47:42.444 --> 47:46.281
A cow comes up the ramp.
Boom, boom, boom.

47:46.448 --> 47:48.158
And you take a sledgehammer
and boop!

47:48.325 --> 47:52.871
You knock the cow dead.
It takes strength.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.415
No cow-killing stories
during dinner.

47:55.582 --> 47:59.294
How do you think
meat get on your plate? Huh?

48:01.129 --> 48:02.881
It takes strength,

48:03.048 --> 48:05.342
but not only strength.

48:05.509 --> 48:07.386
It takes talent,
because it's a craft.

48:07.553 --> 48:09.054
You have to do it right

48:09.221 --> 48:11.181
or the cow gets angry.

48:11.348 --> 48:13.433
And angry meat taste bad.

48:14.643 --> 48:17.604
Yeah, you need arms
to break the skull,

48:17.771 --> 48:19.398
but that's not the goal.

48:19.565 --> 48:22.609
The goal is to crush
the brain inside the skull

48:22.776 --> 48:25.779
and quick,
before the pain can travel

48:25.946 --> 48:27.948
from outside the brain
to the inside,

48:28.115 --> 48:30.659
so the brain never knows
the brain is crushing.

48:30.826 --> 48:34.621
To give a good death is art.

48:34.788 --> 48:37.124
But nowadays,
they have this bolt gun.

48:37.291 --> 48:39.293
You know?
Put it on the forehead.

48:40.877 --> 48:43.297
Yeah.

48:43.463 --> 48:46.133
Now every monkey with a thumb
can kill.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.927
They sit there
all day, all night.

48:53.724 --> 48:56.059
Yeah.

48:56.226 --> 48:58.687
So much for killing.

48:58.854 --> 49:01.940
Hey, do you know checkers?

49:07.863 --> 49:10.407
I was in prison
for three years.

49:12.951 --> 49:16.163
Yeah, people go crazy
for chess.

49:16.330 --> 49:17.748
But you know what?

49:17.914 --> 49:20.584
Checkers is honest.

49:20.751 --> 49:21.627
Hm.

49:21.793 --> 49:24.838
- Every man's an equal.
- Eh, exactly.

49:25.005 --> 49:26.840
After you finish eating,

49:27.007 --> 49:29.009
maybe you and I play checkers.

49:30.761 --> 49:34.473
I shall play black.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.558
Is good?

49:36.725 --> 49:38.310
- Is good.
- Yeah.

49:38.477 --> 49:40.354
I like it. Confident.

49:42.314 --> 49:44.858
Maybe we even bet a little, huh?

49:45.025 --> 49:48.028
You don't have to play him.

49:48.195 --> 49:50.864
What do you say?

49:54.618 --> 49:56.578
You guys play a lot of checkers?

49:56.745 --> 49:59.039
Oh, the sisters don't play.

49:59.206 --> 50:03.085
But I keep sharp,
not like my arms.

50:03.251 --> 50:05.629
They don't get the work-out
they used to, huh?

50:05.796 --> 50:07.798
No more killing floor

50:07.964 --> 50:09.549
to swing my hammer.

50:12.386 --> 50:13.387
Hm.

50:13.553 --> 50:17.057
First blood is mine.

50:19.726 --> 50:22.312
So you've lost. Game is done.

50:24.981 --> 50:27.526
I just started.

50:27.693 --> 50:29.194
Hm.

50:30.987 --> 50:33.448
Confident.

50:38.328 --> 50:40.205
You want to see it?

50:41.248 --> 50:42.416
See what?

50:42.582 --> 50:44.960
The hammer.

50:46.837 --> 50:49.840
The one I used to kill.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.810
It's dull now, but...

51:01.977 --> 51:05.981
..the secret to keeping it clean
is use.

51:06.148 --> 51:08.525
Yeah, blood feeds it,

51:08.692 --> 51:11.528
gives it shine.

51:12.821 --> 51:16.074
You know, the best blood
flows at sunrise,

51:16.241 --> 51:20.412
when the cattle
is rested, fed and calm.

51:20.579 --> 51:24.666
Oh,
now my hammer is red...

51:24.833 --> 51:26.668
..with rust.

51:26.835 --> 51:30.380
No more sunrise blood.

51:36.052 --> 51:41.266
10,000 deaths made right here.

51:56.364 --> 51:58.867
Are you gonna play or what?

52:00.076 --> 52:01.995
It's your move.

52:13.673 --> 52:14.966
Your move.

52:18.345 --> 52:23.517
Hey, we make a wager
on our little game, huh?

52:23.683 --> 52:28.104
You relax.
This is not your game, OK?

52:28.271 --> 52:30.357
You see, your master
wants me to come with him

52:30.524 --> 52:33.568
to deal with his nonsense.

52:33.735 --> 52:36.988
Well...

52:37.155 --> 52:39.574
Listen, if I lose...

52:40.867 --> 52:44.287
..I will go with Votan
and do what he asks

52:44.454 --> 52:47.332
and I will nod
in front of the others.

52:47.499 --> 52:50.126
And if you win?

52:50.293 --> 52:53.255
I get to knock your brains out
with my hammer.

52:56.925 --> 52:59.177
But first, you have to
go down on your knees

52:59.344 --> 53:01.888
and I will hit you
with this.

53:02.931 --> 53:04.516
Just one blow.

53:07.435 --> 53:09.354
Right here.

53:09.521 --> 53:11.648
Sunrise blood.

53:11.815 --> 53:13.483
Is good?

53:18.238 --> 53:20.282
He'll take that shot.

53:20.448 --> 53:24.703
No joke, no boast,
no half-measures.

53:26.746 --> 53:28.874
How good are you?

53:30.750 --> 53:32.586
How bad do you need him?

53:35.380 --> 53:37.173
It's your decision.

53:50.145 --> 53:53.273
Alright, if...
if all this is real

53:53.440 --> 53:57.319
and...and...and TVs talk

53:57.485 --> 53:59.529
and she can read fortunes

53:59.696 --> 54:01.406
and hammers bleed,

54:01.573 --> 54:04.242
and if there is a world...

54:05.869 --> 54:07.662
..under a world...

54:14.419 --> 54:16.087
Yo, fuck it.

54:17.881 --> 54:19.466
Is good.

54:19.633 --> 54:21.259
Is good?

54:21.426 --> 54:23.011
Yeah.

54:23.178 --> 54:25.138
Good.

54:25.305 --> 54:28.850
