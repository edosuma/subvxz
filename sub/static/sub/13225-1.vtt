00:08.032 --> 00:10.800
(birds chirping)

00:50.733 --> 00:54.233
(lively uplifting music)

01:01.400 --> 01:02.233
- Hi, Bob.

01:15.967 --> 01:18.700
(crowd cheering)

01:31.733 --> 01:32.567
- [Ghost Boy] Boo!

01:32.567 --> 01:33.400
- Oh.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.200
Hi.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.467
Merry Chrismas.

02:31.633 --> 02:32.800
- Ms. Sherrington?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.400
I have a question.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.367
Did you know that
Napoleon had a girlfriend

02:38.367 --> 02:41.433
who was 19 years
older than he was?

02:41.433 --> 02:42.600
- [John] Ms. Sherrington,
could you come

02:42.600 --> 02:45.167
to the office
immediately please?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.400
- I did not know that, Alex.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.600
(mellow uplifting music)

03:00.233 --> 03:01.967
(Lucy gasps)

03:01.967 --> 03:03.133
- [John] It's dark.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.000
It's black.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.833
- [Lucy] John?

03:04.833 --> 03:05.767
- [John] It's Ethiopia.

03:05.767 --> 03:06.600
It's the jungle.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.433
- My god, John,

03:07.433 --> 03:08.267
you are the principal.

03:08.267 --> 03:09.733
- Just listen.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.267
Lucy, I want you and
me to chuck everything.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.133
Just chuck it.

03:13.133 --> 03:14.333
- Oh, good god.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.633
- And then we go to some
third world country,

03:15.633 --> 03:16.867
drop to our hands and knees

03:16.867 --> 03:19.267
and sink up to our
elbows in filth.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.100
- Filth?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.600
- Filth is life, Lucy.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.600
See, I chose this janitor's
closet as a symbol.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.100
See, I've really
thought this thing out.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.633
- John, how do we get out of
here without people seeing us?

03:28.633 --> 03:30.100
- Right through that door.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.067
I am sick and tired of
caring what people think.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.733
- You go out first
and then I'm going--

03:34.733 --> 03:35.967
- I wanna bust out of here

03:35.967 --> 03:37.433
and I wanna bust out
of here with you.

03:37.433 --> 03:40.667
Hemingway was shooting
elephants when he was my age.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.833
- John, really, I mean it!

03:43.833 --> 03:45.333
John, I hate that.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.433
I just absolutely hate that.

03:48.433 --> 03:49.767
This yanking!

03:49.767 --> 03:51.833
Don't you ever yank me
like that ever again.

03:51.833 --> 03:52.667
Ever.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.367
You hear me?

03:54.367 --> 03:56.767
- Oh, did you tell
her about the votes?

03:56.767 --> 03:58.533
- Less than a minute
ago, Mrs. Crooper.

03:58.533 --> 04:00.500
- Congratulations, Lucy.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.600
You're queen of
the jamboree again.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.433
The whole town is
so proud of you.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.467
- [Student] Hey, I thought
you were coming with us.

04:09.467 --> 04:10.300
- [Female Student] I am.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.400
- [Alex] Okay.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.467
- Hey, Queenie!

04:13.467 --> 04:14.900
- Ugh!

04:14.900 --> 04:16.166
- Don't you ugh me.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.567
So who's bringing the
pastries for tomorrow?

04:17.567 --> 04:18.833
- I am.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.100
- Well, yes, though you
brought them last time.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.100
- I know.

04:21.100 --> 04:21.933
I want to.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.167
- Hmm, you want to.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.500
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.467
- Hi, Willie.

04:38.467 --> 04:41.300
- Hey, you wanna go out tonight?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.433
- It's a school night.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.233
I really can't.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.433
I really--

04:45.433 --> 04:46.667
- Well, good, 'cause
I can't either.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.233
Sorry to tell you
I'm drunk as a turd.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.300
- Aw, Willie.

04:51.733 --> 04:52.867
- I know.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.967
I know, I hate it too.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.833
I just wanna ask you a favour.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.133
When you see me from now on,

05:00.133 --> 05:02.733
can you try looking
a little deeper?

05:02.733 --> 05:03.567
- Deeper?

05:03.567 --> 05:05.000
- Uh-huh.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.200
'Cause I'm a helluva surprise
when you look past the,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.267
well, you know, me not
having much of a job

05:11.267 --> 05:13.467
and riding around on a
Schwinn, that sort of thing,

05:13.467 --> 05:15.900
and I am so much in
love with you, okay?

05:15.900 --> 05:17.133
- Okay, Willie.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.033
- Thank you, Lucy.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.633
See you later.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.067
(mellow uplifting music)

05:41.067 --> 05:42.833
- Hey, Lucy!

05:42.833 --> 05:44.033
- Hey, Lucy!

05:44.033 --> 05:45.133
Lucy, check it
out, check it out!

05:45.133 --> 05:46.700
- No, no, no, Lucy.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.667
Lucy, check this out.

05:48.667 --> 05:49.500
Yeah!

05:51.567 --> 05:55.000
- [Garbage Man With
Cap] Have a good one.

06:17.733 --> 06:21.167
(mellow whimsical music)

06:37.567 --> 06:40.233
(phone ringing)

06:46.400 --> 06:47.233
- Hello?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.500
- Hi, Lucy.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.167
It's Vernon.

06:50.167 --> 06:52.467
I hope I'm not bothering you.

06:52.467 --> 06:56.600
- No, no, I'm just getting
ready for bed is all.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.933
- Okay, well, I won't keep you.

06:59.933 --> 07:01.267
What I was wondering is,

07:01.267 --> 07:04.267
are you finished with
the books I gave you?

07:04.267 --> 07:05.700
- Well, no, Vernon,

07:05.700 --> 07:09.133
I haven't gotten
around to them yet.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.600
- Well, that's fine then.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.800
I was just curious to know
your thoughts about the poems

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
and that piece on
The End of Nature.

07:15.800 --> 07:20.533
'Cause you always have such
a fresh angle on things.

07:20.533 --> 07:24.167
- Well, I'm looking forward
to them, Vernon, I really am.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.300
- Okay, well, maybe I'll bump
into you tomorrow at school.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.067
I hope so, goodnight.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.600
- Goodnight, Vernon.

07:50.733 --> 07:53.400
(phone ringing)

08:10.700 --> 08:12.233
Hello?

08:12.233 --> 08:14.500
- [Clint] I'm at the Dairy Whip.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.833
- You really are?

08:15.833 --> 08:17.667
- I really am.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.167
I'm coming over.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.933
- What did you say?

08:20.933 --> 08:22.533
- I said I'm coming over.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.333
- I mean to your wife.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.900
- Oh, oh.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.267
I said that I was gonna the
school to watch old game film.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.967
And I did, I actually went there

08:30.967 --> 08:33.299
and I watched old game films
so it wouldn't be a lie.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.133
- Good.

08:35.033 --> 08:35.866
That's good.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.567
What did she say?

08:37.567 --> 08:39.567
- She said fine.

08:39.567 --> 08:42.167
I'm gonna leave my
car in the woods.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.067
- Okay, I'm gonna turn
off the outside lights

08:44.067 --> 08:45.600
so it's darker.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.767
We really have to be very
careful about this, Clint.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.700
- No, I know, I know.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.933
Shee, you think I don't know?

08:51.933 --> 08:54.033
- The side door by the woods.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.100
- Side door by the woods.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
Here I come.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.967
(quirky suspenseful music)

09:39.800 --> 09:42.333
Oh, god, have you
ever felt like this?

09:42.333 --> 09:43.667
- Well, I dunno.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.533
- What do you mean
you don't know?

09:47.533 --> 09:50.200
You know, yes, you do know.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.300
But, the thing is
it's frightening.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.733
This feeling is frightening.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.000
And you know why?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.133
- Why?

09:57.133 --> 09:59.767
- Because this is love, Lucy.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.033
This is it.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.300
It's what we've waited
all of our lives for.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.667
And everybody in this
little fleabag town,

10:05.667 --> 10:10.267
they think that they love
you, but I really love you.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.133
I fooled myself with Verna.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.733
This is the real thing.

10:14.733 --> 10:16.900
This is the genuine thing.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.033
- Is it?

10:23.433 --> 10:25.467
- Well, yes of course it is.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.867
What else could it be?

10:26.867 --> 10:29.200
- [Lucy] Well, I don't know.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.333
- What do you mean,
you don't know?

10:33.333 --> 10:34.967
- It's just when
it comes to love,

10:34.967 --> 10:39.133
the thing that's always clouded
the issue for me is sex.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.567
- You want me to go?

10:41.567 --> 10:44.133
- No, I'm just saying,

10:44.133 --> 10:46.567
in my life, I've always been,

10:48.433 --> 10:51.100
I guess frugal is the word,

10:51.100 --> 10:53.700
frugal with things like this.

10:53.700 --> 10:54.533
- Frugal?

10:56.333 --> 10:58.100
Well, I'm frugal too.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.000
All right, now, I want
you to stand there, okay?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.367
Don't move.

11:10.367 --> 11:11.800
I'm gonna stand here, okay?

11:11.800 --> 11:15.300
Now, I'm gonna take
off all of my clothes

11:15.300 --> 11:18.900
and I'm gonna ask you
to do the same thing.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.833
Lucy Sherrington, if it's sex
that clouds things up for you,

11:48.833 --> 11:50.833
I say let's just scrape
sex off the plate

11:50.833 --> 11:52.367
so you can see things
more clearly, all right?

11:52.367 --> 11:54.800
This is not sex now.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.833
Do you know what this is?

11:56.833 --> 11:57.967
- What?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.067
- Two humans talking.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.267
All right?

12:01.267 --> 12:04.333
Stripped down, no
bullshit, straight on.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.100
Okay, we've known each
other for how long?

12:07.100 --> 12:10.467
- Well, let's see,
maybe what, three years?

12:10.467 --> 12:11.700
- And for most of
that time period,

12:11.700 --> 12:13.700
you and I have been
doing a lot of,

12:13.700 --> 12:17.533
well, smouldering for each
other, wouldn't you agree?

12:17.533 --> 12:18.400
- Have we?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.500
- Yes, we have.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.533
Now, we have been patient,

12:21.533 --> 12:24.833
we've been good, we've
been respectful of people.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.467
- Yes, we have.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.000
- We're not fools.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.133
We're not kids all
juiced up on hormones.

12:30.133 --> 12:30.967
- No, no.

12:32.167 --> 12:34.067
- You know what we are?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.600
Romeo and Juliet.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.800
- Romeo and Juliet?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.000
- I never believed in
that kind of baloney.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.433
You know that kind of love
where nothing else matters.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.533
Or the kind of love
that you'd die for.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.167
But tonight when I was
watching that game film,

12:50.167 --> 12:51.800
I was just leaning
back in my chair,

12:51.800 --> 12:54.300
with my arms hanging down

12:54.300 --> 12:55.467
and I swear to god,

12:55.467 --> 12:58.133
all I could think about was you.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.567
- Well, but hadn't
you actually seen

13:01.567 --> 13:04.967
that particular
game film before?

13:04.967 --> 13:06.967
- Yes, but the point is,

13:08.133 --> 13:11.633
I've never felt like
this before, Lucy.

13:11.633 --> 13:14.933
I love you and if I
have to wait a year,

13:14.933 --> 13:18.233
five years, if I have to
wait the rest of my life,

13:18.233 --> 13:20.967
I will not touch
you until you say,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.633
"Clint, I love you."

13:27.333 --> 13:28.167
- Clint,

13:32.100 --> 13:33.000
I love you.

13:35.633 --> 13:36.533
(Clint screams)

13:36.533 --> 13:37.367
Clint!

13:38.533 --> 13:39.633
Clint!

13:39.633 --> 13:40.467
Clint?

13:40.467 --> 13:41.300
Clint?

13:44.467 --> 13:45.300
Clint?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.633
Clint?

13:50.633 --> 13:53.633
(suspenseful music)

14:00.767 --> 14:01.600
Clint?

14:02.867 --> 14:03.700
Clint?

14:12.233 --> 14:13.067
Clint?

14:47.700 --> 14:49.100
- [Clint] Lucy!

14:49.100 --> 14:50.767
Lucy, what happened?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.100
- Clint?

14:54.100 --> 14:55.933
- [Clint] Lucy, where are you?

14:55.933 --> 14:57.033
- I'm here!

14:57.033 --> 14:58.033
I'm right up here, Clint!

14:58.033 --> 14:59.100
Are you all right?

14:59.100 --> 14:59.900
- [Clint] I don't know.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.100
I can't see anything.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.367
- Are you hurt?

15:02.367 --> 15:03.400
- [Clint] I'm not
even on anything.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.767
I'm just floating.

15:04.767 --> 15:05.867
- You listen to me.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.433
Lie very still.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.367
- [Clint] On what?

15:08.367 --> 15:09.600
There is no ground!

15:09.600 --> 15:10.500
There is no anything!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.567
What is going on here?

15:12.567 --> 15:14.100
- I don't know, Clint!

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
There's a big hole up here

15:15.600 --> 15:17.100
but when I go down to the
cellar, there's nothing!

15:17.100 --> 15:18.500
Just the ceiling.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.667
What do you see
when you look up?

15:19.667 --> 15:20.533
- [Clint] Up?

15:20.533 --> 15:21.667
There is no up!

15:21.667 --> 15:22.733
Everything is the same!

15:22.733 --> 15:23.900
It's all black!

15:23.900 --> 15:24.833
Ow.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.867
What the?

15:25.867 --> 15:27.500
Wait a minute.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.167
Something just hit me.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.700
There are horrible little
things pinging off of me!

15:31.700 --> 15:32.533
- Things?

15:32.533 --> 15:33.467
- [Clint] Yes, things!

15:33.467 --> 15:35.300
Little things!

15:35.300 --> 15:36.167
- Coins!

15:36.167 --> 15:37.133
- [Clint] Coins?

15:37.133 --> 15:37.967
I threw down coins.

15:37.967 --> 15:38.800
- [Clint] Coin, ow!

15:38.800 --> 15:40.300
I've been shot.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.333
Ow!

15:41.333 --> 15:43.733
- No, it's a candy dish.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.367
- [Clint] What?

15:45.367 --> 15:47.167
It's just a dish.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.067
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.233
It's floating.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.933
What is going on here?

15:52.933 --> 15:54.400
Why there is no ground?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.800
I have to have a ground, Lucy.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.400
- I think I should go
get somebody, Clint.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.333
- [Clint] No, no!

15:59.333 --> 16:01.400
What is that gonna look like?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.267
Me at your house at this hour?

16:03.267 --> 16:06.200
Now, remember, we're
on a rendezvous here.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.300
- Well, couldn't we be doing

16:07.300 --> 16:09.867
some sort of
school-related thing?

16:09.867 --> 16:11.633
- [Clint] Okay, like what?

16:11.633 --> 16:12.567
- I don't know.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.800
A project?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.567
- [Clint] An art,
slash, gym project?

16:15.567 --> 16:16.600
Who is gonna buy that?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.767
Lucy, come on?

16:20.033 --> 16:23.400
- Listen, if things I
throw are hitting you,

16:23.400 --> 16:24.800
what if I throw down a rope?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.067
- [Clint] A rope!

16:26.067 --> 16:28.200
Oh my god, yes, that
is a fantastic idea!

16:28.200 --> 16:29.400
Go get a rope, Lucy.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
(knocking on door)

16:31.400 --> 16:32.933
What the hell was that?

16:32.933 --> 16:34.367
- Somebody's here.

16:34.367 --> 16:37.833
- [Clint] Okay, uh, tell
them you're sleeping.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.067
- [Elliot] Luce, it's me.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.267
- It's my father.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.133
- [Clint] Don't let him in.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.567
All right?

16:43.567 --> 16:44.800
You cannot let him in!

16:44.800 --> 16:46.133
- Shh, shh, shh.

16:51.967 --> 16:52.800
Hi, dad.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.300
- [Elliot] You got a guest?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.733
- [Lucy] No. I was just.

16:57.733 --> 16:59.367
- I know, that's okay.

16:59.367 --> 17:00.967
Your goddamn pain
in the neck mother

17:00.967 --> 17:02.467
said it was too late to come by,

17:02.467 --> 17:05.867
but your phone's been
busy for weeks and.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.833
I just gotta ask you
something, honey.

17:09.833 --> 17:10.767
- What?

17:10.767 --> 17:12.800
- Do you think I'm a good mayor?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.200
- Yes.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.733
You're a wonderful mayor.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.200
Of course, you're a good mayor.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.333
- Well, then why can't I
write a simple goddamn poem?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.233
- Poem?

17:22.233 --> 17:23.433
- Yeah.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.867
You see, this year I
wanna open the jamboree

17:24.867 --> 17:26.233
with a little poem.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.900
Something that's kind
of uplifting, you know?

17:28.900 --> 17:33.067
Dealing with virtue and honesty
and trust and integrity,

17:34.300 --> 17:36.333
stuff that's right
up your alley.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.300
I mean you make people
sick with this kinda stuff,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.200
you're so goddamn good.

17:42.367 --> 17:45.633
So I thought maybe you
could start me off.

17:48.333 --> 17:52.267
- Well, it's something I'm gonna
have to think about, daddy.

17:52.267 --> 17:55.200
I've kinda shut
down for the night.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.933
- Oh, uh, pfft, yeah of course,

18:00.233 --> 18:02.800
I'm sorry, it's late.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.000
But at least you
understand the importance

18:05.000 --> 18:06.833
of an opening poem.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.800
Goddamn moron of a mother.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.433
Lucy?

18:10.433 --> 18:12.267
- [Lucy] Hmm?

18:12.267 --> 18:13.933
- What's the matter?

18:15.900 --> 18:18.467
Aw, I know what it is.

18:18.467 --> 18:22.300
You don't like me calling
your mother a moron.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.133
Listen, sweetie, I'd
call your mother a moron

18:25.133 --> 18:28.567
if she was standing
right next to me.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.400
Sweetie.

18:30.433 --> 18:31.767
It's okay.

18:31.767 --> 18:35.200
I mean she calls me
dumbo and Mr. Flabby.

18:36.633 --> 18:39.233
That kind of thing,
you know that.

18:39.233 --> 18:43.400
Sweetheart, someday you're
gonna meet the ideal guy

18:44.867 --> 18:48.733
and if you can stay
together as long as we have,

18:48.733 --> 18:50.933
well, then, it'll all
go to hell for you too

18:50.933 --> 18:53.033
and that'd be that.

18:53.033 --> 18:56.600
Anyway, when a good opening
for my poem hits you,

18:56.600 --> 18:59.633
just give me a call or come
over to the house, okay?

18:59.633 --> 19:01.400
Aw, thank you, sweetie.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.333
You're the best.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.833
Goodnight.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.500
Oh, and your porch light is out.

19:12.267 --> 19:13.167
- He's gone!

19:13.167 --> 19:14.000
- [Clint] Yes, I know.

19:14.000 --> 19:14.833
I can hear.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.233
I can hear everything!

19:16.233 --> 19:17.567
Lucy, rope.

19:17.567 --> 19:18.500
We gotta get rope.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.733
I need to get out of here.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.000
- Rope.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, how much rope?

19:23.000 --> 19:23.833
- [Clint] Lots.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.867
Miles of the stuff.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.300
- Well, I don't know, Clint.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.200
Won't me asking for miles
of rope at this hour

19:29.200 --> 19:32.233
make people think
something's funny?

19:32.233 --> 19:33.667
- [Clint] Good point.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.067
Uh, Willie Perry!

19:36.767 --> 19:37.633
- Willie Perry?

19:37.633 --> 19:38.467
- [Clint] Yes!

19:38.467 --> 19:39.500
He's perfect!

19:39.500 --> 19:41.467
Lucy, go down to the port hole

19:41.467 --> 19:43.433
and find Willie
Perry, all right?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.367
He is nuts.

19:44.367 --> 19:45.533
He saves everything, all right?

19:45.533 --> 19:46.533
He'll have tonnes of rope.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.800
He'll help us.

19:47.800 --> 19:51.400
- Well, but what about
the rendezvous aspect?

19:53.367 --> 19:55.500
- [Clint] That's why
Willie is perfect.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.667
Look, we're blood-brothers
since we were 10.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.967
All right, he won't tell a soul!

20:00.967 --> 20:02.567
Just go get Willie.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.800
All right, you gotta
do it, Lucy, go!

20:05.800 --> 20:06.633
Get him.

20:08.733 --> 20:09.567
Lucy?

20:12.067 --> 20:15.667
(quirky suspenseful music)

20:25.333 --> 20:28.767
(police car siren yelps)

20:48.933 --> 20:51.100
- Ma'am, I don't suppose
you have any idea

20:51.100 --> 20:55.267
it is against the law to
look that fantastic, do you?

20:56.467 --> 20:59.300
- Howard, I'm just not
gonna stop anymore.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.967
I'm just not.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.400
This is no fair.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.233
- We gotta go dancing, Lucy.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.800
Oh, we haven't been
dancing for months.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.733
You remember the last
time we went dancing?

21:08.733 --> 21:09.967
- I do.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.800
- The sweat was
pouring off of us.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.500
We gotta get sweating like
that again, Lucy, I mean it.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.333
(woman speaking on the radio)

21:17.333 --> 21:18.167
Oh!

21:19.433 --> 21:20.267
Gotta go.

21:21.867 --> 21:23.433
Hey, where you going so late?

21:23.433 --> 21:25.733
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
just name a night,

21:25.733 --> 21:26.900
I'll call you.

21:28.767 --> 21:30.767
God, you break my heart.

21:34.633 --> 21:36.600
- [Man] I don't get it either.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.033
- [Brenda] You don't get it?

21:38.033 --> 21:38.933
- [Man] No.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.467
- Hey, congratulations, my
queen, third year in a row.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.033
What are you doing in here?

21:47.033 --> 21:48.033
You want some popcorn?

21:48.033 --> 21:49.300
- No, thank you, Brenda.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.333
I'm looking for
Willie, actually.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.167
- Willie?

21:52.167 --> 21:53.433
You just missed him.

21:53.433 --> 21:55.500
He just went up the
cliffs with Randy and,

21:55.500 --> 21:58.833
I don't know, a
couple of others.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.000
Want a pretzel?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.667
- No, thank you, no.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.100
- [Rydell] I'm completely lost.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.500
Am I anywhere near this address?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.433
- [Brenda] You're
looking for Clint Coburn?

22:14.433 --> 22:15.300
- [Rydell] Yeah, you know him?

22:15.300 --> 22:16.133
- Yeah, who doesn't?

22:16.133 --> 22:17.633
He's not far.

22:17.633 --> 22:21.367
Hey, Lucy, you going up to
the cliffs after Willie?

22:22.367 --> 22:23.300
- No.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.867
- You going home?

22:24.867 --> 22:25.700
- Yeah.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.867
- Okay, follow her.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.533
She goes right
past Clint's place.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.967
Is that okay with you, Luce?

22:30.967 --> 22:31.800
- Mm-hmm.

22:37.567 --> 22:38.800
- Rydell Whyte.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.667
What are you gonna do, toot?

22:47.667 --> 22:48.500
- Toot?

22:50.333 --> 22:51.700
- You know, when you come
to Clint Coburn's house,

22:51.700 --> 22:53.967
you gonna toot your horn or?

22:53.967 --> 22:56.367
- I'll slow down and point.

22:56.367 --> 22:57.200
There's deer.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.500
- Deer?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.667
- Ceramic deer and
ducks, you'll see.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.700
I'm in a little bit of a hurry.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.533
- No problem.

23:03.533 --> 23:04.533
I'm right behind you,

23:04.533 --> 23:07.367
Lucy-I'm-in-a-little-bit-of-a-hurry.

23:10.633 --> 23:14.200
(quirky suspenseful music)

23:22.633 --> 23:23.900
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

23:48.433 --> 23:51.367
(car horn honking)

24:11.800 --> 24:13.033
You have a rag or something?

24:13.033 --> 24:14.900
I kinda bonked my
forehead back there.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.333
- Oh, my god, what happened?

24:17.333 --> 24:19.300
- I don't know, I hit my
head on the stupid car.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.133
You just have a rag or?

24:20.133 --> 24:20.933
- Here, here.

24:20.933 --> 24:22.067
- Ah, man.

24:22.067 --> 24:22.867
Thanks, I just
didn't have anything.

24:22.867 --> 24:24.133
Oh this is good, good.

24:24.133 --> 24:27.667
I know you're in a
hurry so, uh, bye.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.333
- How bad is it?

24:29.333 --> 24:32.033
- I don't know, it's nothing.

24:32.033 --> 24:33.033
Can you see?

24:34.167 --> 24:37.067
- [Lucy] Yeah,
well, it's a gash.

24:37.067 --> 24:38.667
- A gash?

24:38.667 --> 24:40.300
- Yes, a gash.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.333
- I mean, is it deep?

24:42.333 --> 24:43.467
- Well, no, not very.

24:43.467 --> 24:44.733
I mean, your
skull's right there.

24:44.733 --> 24:45.667
- You can see my skull?

24:45.667 --> 24:46.867
- No. I'm just saying--

24:46.867 --> 24:48.267
- Right, right, right,
how deep can it be

24:48.267 --> 24:49.233
'cause your skull's
right there, good.

24:49.233 --> 24:50.467
Oh, this is good.

24:50.467 --> 24:51.667
But, man, oh man,
it sure is bleeding.

24:51.667 --> 24:54.567
Are there any main
arteries in your head?

24:54.567 --> 24:55.500
- I don't know.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.033
No.

24:57.033 --> 24:59.600
I don't think so, but I think
you oughta get some stitches.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.333
- Stitches?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.233
Oh, my god, where am
I gonna get stitches?

25:03.233 --> 25:06.533
You know, I don't
even know where I am.

25:06.533 --> 25:07.900
You know, fine, you know
what, I'll deal with this.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.167
I'm good.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.967
You know, thank you very
much for your troubles.

25:11.967 --> 25:12.800
Oh.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.167
Whoopsy-daisy.

25:19.367 --> 25:20.200
- Come here.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.700
Come sit.

25:21.700 --> 25:25.133
- Just got a little
case of the whirlies.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.967
Get a little funny
when it comes to,

25:29.967 --> 25:33.300
blood of my own that's
coming out of my.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.000
Oh, boy.

25:35.900 --> 25:36.733
Oh.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.100
This is awful, I'm so sorry,

25:40.100 --> 25:43.600
but how far do we have
to go for some ice?

25:47.300 --> 25:48.900
- Clint, I couldn't
get Willie or any rope

25:48.900 --> 25:51.800
but there's a man at the bar
and he's looking for you.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.033
He's going to your house.

25:53.033 --> 25:53.867
- [Clint] What?

25:53.867 --> 25:55.467
What man, who?

25:55.467 --> 25:56.300
- I never saw him before.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.333
He's in the car.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.267
I'll be right back.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.167
- [Clint] He's in the car?

25:59.167 --> 26:00.167
- Shh.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.600
Yes.
- Outside in the car?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.567
- Yes, he needs help,
what could I do?

26:03.567 --> 26:04.800
- [Clint] Ditch
him, that's what.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.133
Who is this guy?

26:07.133 --> 26:09.800
- I don't know, Rydell somebody.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.300
He didn't even know
where you lived.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.133
- [Clint] Rydell?

26:12.133 --> 26:14.367
I don't know any Rydell.

26:14.367 --> 26:16.267
What's he look like?

26:16.267 --> 26:17.100
- Dark.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.433
He looks dark.

26:18.433 --> 26:19.867
- [Clint] Dark?

26:19.867 --> 26:21.267
Oh, no.

26:21.267 --> 26:24.867
Oh, god, oh please,
please, please, no, no.

26:24.867 --> 26:25.700
Dark?

26:25.700 --> 26:26.600
Ugh.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.867
- I'll be right back.

26:27.867 --> 26:29.100
- [Clint] I'm down
in a hole floating

26:29.100 --> 26:31.800
and now they're
coming to get me.

26:33.233 --> 26:34.900
- Coming to get you?

26:35.767 --> 26:37.500
Who's coming to get you, Clint?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
- [Clint] Thugs, Lucy, thugs.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
Oh, holy crow,

26:40.500 --> 26:42.667
Jesus god, now what?

26:42.667 --> 26:44.067
- Thugs?

26:44.067 --> 26:45.133
- [Clint] Granville's thugs.

26:45.133 --> 26:46.400
There's only one?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.367
There's only one dark thug?

26:48.367 --> 26:50.400
- Who's Granville?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.267
- [Clint] Granville's
a bookie, Lucy.

26:52.267 --> 26:53.100
My bookie.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.167
It doesn't matter.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.500
Nothing matters.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.500
- A bookie?

26:59.500 --> 27:01.233
- [Clint] I make a
sports bet or two.

27:01.233 --> 27:02.400
No big deal.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.233
No big deal.

27:03.233 --> 27:04.333
It doesn't matter.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.267
Nothing matters but us.

27:10.033 --> 27:10.867
Lucy?

27:11.767 --> 27:13.667
- I'll be back soon, Clint.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.567
- [Clint] No, no,
no, don't go Lucy.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.400
For god's sakes,
the guy's a goon.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.967
- This is a nice
feature, this seat.

27:31.967 --> 27:32.800
- Uh-huh.

27:40.433 --> 27:41.433
- Is he mad?

27:42.933 --> 27:43.767
- Who?

27:46.933 --> 27:48.167
- Your husband.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.633
- I don't have a husband.

27:51.633 --> 27:53.133
Please hold still.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.967
So, you're a friend of Clint's?

28:09.333 --> 28:10.867
- You know him?

28:10.867 --> 28:11.700
- Yes.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.633
Yes, we teach at
the same school.

28:15.633 --> 28:17.067
- He's a teacher?

28:17.967 --> 28:19.233
- Gym.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.933
Phys-ed, he's a coach.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.267
- What kind of coach?

28:23.267 --> 28:25.267
- [Lucy] Football coach.

28:27.067 --> 28:28.633
- A football coach.

28:30.033 --> 28:32.533
And what do you teach?

28:32.533 --> 28:33.667
- The bleeding stopped.

28:33.667 --> 28:34.633
- Thank you.

28:34.633 --> 28:37.467
And what is it that you teach?

28:37.467 --> 28:38.400
- Art.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.567
Should I drive you home or--

28:39.567 --> 28:40.400
- Art?

28:40.400 --> 28:41.233
Really?

28:43.233 --> 28:44.600
- [Lucy] Yes.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.433
- Man.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.600
Man, that's incredible,
to be able to teach art.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.567
- What's so incredible about it?

28:57.567 --> 28:58.400
- Well.

29:03.433 --> 29:05.000
I mean, what is it?

29:06.367 --> 29:09.567
- You don't know what art is?

29:09.567 --> 29:10.733
- Well, kinda.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.967
But I couldn't
put it into words.

29:17.167 --> 29:18.767
I mean, what is it?

29:23.467 --> 29:25.867
- And what is it that you do?

29:28.633 --> 29:30.133
- What about if you ask me,

29:30.133 --> 29:33.600
how about if you ask me what
is it that I would like to do?

29:33.600 --> 29:34.800
- Look, are you feeling--

29:34.800 --> 29:36.067
- So you have no
interest in knowing

29:36.067 --> 29:37.367
what it is that I
would like to do?

29:37.367 --> 29:38.867
- What is it that
you would like to do?

29:38.867 --> 29:41.533
- None of your goddamn business.

29:47.467 --> 29:48.300
Yeah.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.867
I would like to build a
stone cottage in the country.

29:55.967 --> 29:59.133
I would like to have
maybe five acres.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.400
Yeah.

30:04.933 --> 30:09.033
And I would like to write
at least one good poem.

30:15.067 --> 30:16.300
- Are you feeling better?

30:16.300 --> 30:18.633
- Yeah, let's test her out.

30:25.133 --> 30:25.967
Oi.

30:28.567 --> 30:29.400
All right.

30:31.133 --> 30:34.300
(Rydell sighs deeply)

30:38.967 --> 30:42.400
(mellow whimsical music)

30:51.867 --> 30:54.233
Which way are the cliffs?

30:54.233 --> 30:55.300
- The cliffs?

30:56.700 --> 31:00.167
- The ones they were
talking about in the bar.

31:01.300 --> 31:02.900
- Hard to describe.

31:04.233 --> 31:06.000
- Oh, kinda like art?

31:09.700 --> 31:10.900
Thank you.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.967
You've been very helpful.

31:14.367 --> 31:15.267
I'll walk back.

31:15.267 --> 31:16.500
I'd like to walk back.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.333
Fresh air.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.700
I'm all perked up.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.467
- Do you know where you are?

31:26.467 --> 31:28.033
- [Rydell] No idea.

31:30.433 --> 31:34.100
Let me know when you
figure out what art is.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.167
(Clint snoring)

32:06.800 --> 32:09.967
(quirky lively music)

32:12.467 --> 32:13.733
- [Clint] Lucy?

32:16.567 --> 32:17.400
Lucy?

32:19.767 --> 32:22.667
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy,
Lu, Lu, Lu, Lucy!

32:30.700 --> 32:31.933
- Oh, god.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.800
- [Clint] Lucy?

32:33.800 --> 32:34.900
- Clint, it's almost eight.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.033
I'm gonna call in sick.

32:36.033 --> 32:37.500
- [Clint] No, no, you can't.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.567
Look, I slept like
a log last night.

32:39.567 --> 32:41.000
I feel great!

32:41.000 --> 32:42.433
And I've thought it
all out, all right?

32:42.433 --> 32:43.367
Everything fits.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.033
You have to go to school.

32:45.033 --> 32:45.867
- I do?

32:45.867 --> 32:46.900
- [Clint] Yes, yes!

32:46.900 --> 32:48.300
If we're both not at school,

32:48.300 --> 32:49.567
people might think
something's fishy.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.600
Plus, if you don't go to school,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.100
you can't go to the
hardware store for rope.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.133
Forget Willie.

32:55.133 --> 32:56.467
Alright, after school,

32:56.467 --> 32:57.733
you go to the hardware store

32:57.733 --> 32:59.867
and you buy all the
rope that Eddie's got,

32:59.867 --> 33:02.033
and then you come
home, you pull me out.

33:02.033 --> 33:04.033
I go home, and I lie like crazy.

33:04.033 --> 33:05.300
So, go!

33:05.300 --> 33:06.900
- What about the
whole bookie thing?

33:06.900 --> 33:08.133
- [Clint] Well, that's my lie!

33:08.133 --> 33:10.567
Some thug kidnapped
me last night!

33:10.567 --> 33:12.300
He came looking
for me at the bar!

33:12.300 --> 33:13.667
Brenda will back it up!

33:13.667 --> 33:15.800
You see, it all fits!

33:15.800 --> 33:16.933
All right, so just go.

33:16.933 --> 33:17.867
Okay?

33:17.867 --> 33:20.200
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:20.200 --> 33:23.367
(steady quirky music)

33:29.567 --> 33:30.967
- Hi, Ms. Sherrington.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.300
Congratulations.

33:36.267 --> 33:38.933
(Verna sobbing)

33:43.367 --> 33:44.467
- Poor Verna.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.533
I don't wanna go
in there either,

33:46.533 --> 33:49.267
but somebody's gotta tell her.

33:49.267 --> 33:50.833
- Tell her what?

33:50.833 --> 33:52.900
- Oh, you didn't hear?

33:52.900 --> 33:54.733
- Couple of joggers
found Clint's SUV

33:54.733 --> 33:57.400
down the old Jones logging road.

33:58.833 --> 34:00.433
Starting to get weird with
the blood and all, isn't it?

34:00.433 --> 34:01.633
- What blood?

34:01.633 --> 34:03.733
- They found a big
wad of bloody Kleenex

34:03.733 --> 34:06.300
on the road near Clint's house.

34:15.867 --> 34:17.100
I'll call you.

34:20.733 --> 34:22.400
The law has arrived.

34:35.433 --> 34:39.000
(quirky suspenseful music)

35:00.267 --> 35:01.200
- Hi, Lucy.

35:02.633 --> 35:03.467
Hi.

35:04.833 --> 35:08.133
I copied something down I
think you're really gonna like.

35:08.133 --> 35:09.067
Because you know how
you're always saying

35:09.067 --> 35:10.733
you don't know very much?

35:10.733 --> 35:11.567
Well, listen.

35:11.567 --> 35:12.800
The less one knows,

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
the more passionate
one is able to become.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.033
And the more one knows,

35:16.033 --> 35:19.133
the less passionate
one is able to become.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.800
So, do you think that's true or?

35:24.400 --> 35:26.833
- Gee, I'm not sure, Vernon.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.833
- Because if it is, it's
pretty sad because, you know,

35:29.833 --> 35:33.433
we, like us, like people
thrive on knowing.

35:34.900 --> 35:39.000
And what hope do we have for
sustained passion, you know.

35:39.000 --> 35:39.933
Do you see?

35:43.367 --> 35:45.500
I'll just leave it with you.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.967
Not a big thing.

35:46.967 --> 35:48.133
- Bye, Vernon!

35:54.600 --> 35:56.500
- Did you tell him?

35:56.500 --> 35:57.600
- [Lucy] Who?

35:58.433 --> 35:59.367
- Clint Coburn,

35:59.367 --> 36:00.833
did you tell him about me?

36:00.833 --> 36:02.833
- Did I tell him what about you?

36:02.833 --> 36:05.067
- That I'm looking for him.

36:05.967 --> 36:08.200
Did you talk to him at all?

36:11.467 --> 36:12.300
He never went home.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.133
He never went to school.

36:13.133 --> 36:15.000
He must be ducking me.

36:15.000 --> 36:15.833
Why am I doing this?

36:15.833 --> 36:17.600
Who's kidding who?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.800
Does he drink?

36:18.800 --> 36:19.633
- Drink?

36:19.633 --> 36:20.800
- [Rydell] Booze.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.133
- I would have no
information about that.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.967
- I'll try some bars.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.967
I went to those cliffs.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.400
And they're really beautiful.

36:46.567 --> 36:48.133
And I'm sorry about
being such a big baby

36:48.133 --> 36:50.067
about this whole thing.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.567
It's not even puffy.

36:53.900 --> 36:54.733
You're very sweet.

36:54.733 --> 36:55.567
Thank you.

37:08.633 --> 37:10.200
- More?

37:10.200 --> 37:12.967
- All of it, please, Ed.

37:12.967 --> 37:15.933
- Maybe, we should've
left it on the spool.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.633
What do you want
with all this rope?

37:18.633 --> 37:22.133
- Oh, we're doing a
rope project in class.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.733
(growls)

37:25.733 --> 37:28.633
- Please, don't do that, Ed.

37:28.633 --> 37:30.633
- I'm just growling at you.

37:30.633 --> 37:31.833
I know but still.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.300
- You make a man
growl, you know,

37:33.300 --> 37:35.467
that's all there is to it.

37:37.467 --> 37:40.067
- Do you have more
spools of rope, Ed?

37:40.067 --> 37:41.467
- Nope.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.700
I can get more.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.800
Might take a week.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.067
Might take more.

37:47.067 --> 37:47.933
Might take less.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.333
- This is fine.

37:49.333 --> 37:52.067
- Well, I'll haul it
out to the car for you.

37:52.067 --> 37:55.500
Why don't you hold my
chocolate eclair for me?

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
You can take a bite
out of it if you want.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.300
- Oh.

38:10.033 --> 38:10.867
Oh, god!

38:11.933 --> 38:14.367
Clint, people are coming over.

38:14.367 --> 38:16.100
- [Clint] That was
just six hours?

38:16.100 --> 38:17.667
Felt like a month.

38:17.667 --> 38:18.700
Did you get the rope?

38:18.700 --> 38:20.033
- Yes, I'm throwing it down.

38:20.033 --> 38:20.867
Did you hear what I said?

38:20.867 --> 38:22.300
People are coming over.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.133
- [Clint] People?

38:23.133 --> 38:23.967
People who?

38:23.967 --> 38:24.900
- My friends.

38:24.900 --> 38:26.500
Once a month at three, I forgot.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.267
There's nothing I can do.

38:28.267 --> 38:29.200
15 minutes!

38:30.633 --> 38:31.800
Are you reaching your hand up?

38:31.800 --> 38:32.633
- [Clint] Yes, yes!

38:32.633 --> 38:33.467
Keep her coming.

38:33.467 --> 38:34.433
How much did you get?

38:34.433 --> 38:35.900
- All they had.

38:35.900 --> 38:37.267
And they found your car.

38:37.267 --> 38:38.200
- [Clint] What?

38:38.200 --> 38:39.433
No, that's impossible.

38:39.433 --> 38:40.667
I threw branches on it.

38:40.667 --> 38:41.767
And grass.

38:41.767 --> 38:43.267
- Well, they found it.

38:43.267 --> 38:44.767
Maybe I should just tell.

38:44.767 --> 38:45.700
- [Clint] Tell?

38:45.700 --> 38:47.433
No, Verna, she might just,

38:47.433 --> 38:49.133
I don't know, she must
just keel right over.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.400
It would be like
murder, all right?

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
We cannot tell her.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.833
Are you still
feeding me the rope?

38:53.833 --> 38:55.667
- Yes, are you fishing
your hand around?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.500
- [Clint] Yes, both hands!

38:57.500 --> 38:58.567
- Well, that's it.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.233
- [Clint] That's it?

39:04.300 --> 39:05.900
- Oh, god.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.100
Oh, god.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.467
Helen's here, oh god.

39:08.467 --> 39:09.467
- [Clint] The rug!

39:09.467 --> 39:10.733
Cover me with the rug!

39:10.733 --> 39:11.967
- The rug.

39:11.967 --> 39:13.167
- [Clint] Wait, wait,
what if they step on it?

39:13.167 --> 39:15.400
What if someone falls in?

39:15.400 --> 39:16.933
- The coffee table!

39:16.933 --> 39:17.767
- [Clint] Yes!

39:17.767 --> 39:19.033
The coffee table!

39:19.033 --> 39:19.900
You are a genius,
the coffee table!

39:19.900 --> 39:20.733
Yes!

39:20.733 --> 39:21.933
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

39:21.933 --> 39:23.733
Could you throw me down
a snack first, okay?

39:23.733 --> 39:25.133
I'm dying down here.

39:25.133 --> 39:28.233
I need a bread, a
carrot, anything, please.

39:42.533 --> 39:43.367
- Oh!

39:47.833 --> 39:51.000
(steady quirky music)

39:52.667 --> 39:56.000
(crescendo building up)

39:57.533 --> 39:58.367
Hi!

39:59.900 --> 40:01.233
- [Helen] Okay, maybe
we ought to let Nancy

40:01.233 --> 40:02.833
off the hot seat for now.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.933
- No, no, this is good.

40:04.933 --> 40:06.533
Just let me finish.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.733
Where did I leave off?

40:11.067 --> 40:12.000
- He had just kicked

40:12.000 --> 40:13.333
the birdcage across the room.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.800
- Oh, yeah.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.333
And then, and then he
said every time we kissed,

40:16.333 --> 40:19.167
all he could see was our jaw
hinges opening and closing,

40:19.167 --> 40:21.800
our tongues like slabs of
meat poking in and out,

40:21.800 --> 40:23.333
our teeth separated
from each other

40:23.333 --> 40:25.333
by just two flaps of hide.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.000
- Whoa, hide?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.133
- Yeah, I don't
know, he hunts a lot.

40:29.133 --> 40:31.400
Maybe that's why he
called our lips hide.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.433
- This one doesn't
sound so good, Nance.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.867
- No.

40:34.867 --> 40:35.700
No.

40:36.933 --> 40:39.433
Well, there, I'm done
being on the hot seat.

40:39.433 --> 40:40.967
Who's next?

40:40.967 --> 40:42.233
Lucy?

40:42.233 --> 40:43.767
- Yeah, you don't need
to take notes for Lucy.

40:43.767 --> 40:44.967
Lucy's always fine and the men

40:44.967 --> 40:46.767
in her life are always nice.

40:46.767 --> 40:48.300
- I'm not always fine.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.567
- Oh yeah, how many fines
and nices was it last time?

40:50.567 --> 40:51.733
Remember, we kept track.

40:51.733 --> 40:52.733
- Oh, ah yes.

40:52.733 --> 40:53.567
So, 17.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.500
- Well, I don't care.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.600
I could say it a thousand times

40:57.600 --> 40:59.433
and that doesn't mean it's true.

40:59.433 --> 41:00.833
I'm not always fine.

41:00.833 --> 41:01.667
Nobody is.

41:01.667 --> 41:02.833
And I would really like

41:02.833 --> 41:05.900
if you would stop
thinking that about me.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.800
I think I'm gonna make more tea.

41:14.700 --> 41:15.667
- Okay.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.600
(laughing)

41:17.600 --> 41:19.167
- You know, the
thing that gets me?

41:19.167 --> 41:20.633
There's like a million people

41:20.633 --> 41:22.600
out there that I could
have a life with,

41:22.600 --> 41:24.433
that I could love.

41:24.433 --> 41:27.600
I don't know, doesn't that
idea just drive you nuts?

41:27.600 --> 41:30.100
I mean, in this
town, there are men.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.000
- [Percy] Oh, please name one?

41:32.000 --> 41:32.833
- [Fay] Name 10.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.333
Include addresses.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.967
- You know, I just think that
anybody could love anybody.

41:36.967 --> 41:40.100
I mean, that's what I think.

41:40.100 --> 41:40.933
No?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.033
- Yeah, I liked where
the table was, Luce.

41:44.033 --> 41:45.367
This is nowhere.

41:46.367 --> 41:49.733
- Well, I'm just experimenting.

41:49.733 --> 41:52.400
(phone ringing)

41:54.267 --> 41:55.100
Hello?

41:55.100 --> 41:56.133
- [Nancy] Clint Coburn.

41:56.133 --> 41:56.967
- [Fay] Ugh.

41:56.967 --> 41:58.167
- [Helen] Clint Coburn?

41:58.167 --> 41:59.933
- [Nancy] Yeah, he's
one of the guys in town

41:59.933 --> 42:02.467
that I'm kind of attracted to.

42:02.467 --> 42:04.233
- [Fay] He's married.

42:04.233 --> 42:07.033
- [Nancy] I'm just talking
about being attracted.

42:07.033 --> 42:07.867
- Sorry, hello.

42:07.867 --> 42:08.700
- [Fay] No.

42:08.700 --> 42:09.533
- What do you mean, no?

42:09.533 --> 42:11.133
- No attraction, none.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.367
He's a football coach.

42:12.367 --> 42:14.267
It's like a lion tamer.

42:14.267 --> 42:16.633
It's not a real thing to be.

42:16.633 --> 42:17.533
Yeah, no.

42:17.533 --> 42:18.367
- Yeah.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.867
Is everything okay?

42:21.867 --> 42:23.400
- Oh, fine, fine,

42:23.400 --> 42:25.200
just a little emergency.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.600
- Oh.
- School, nothing big.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.167
But, so upsy-daisy.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.400
I guess we gotta wrap it up a
bit early-ish, I am so sorry.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.667
- No, go, go, go, go!
- We can clean up, go, go.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.933
Go, we can clean up, go.

42:36.933 --> 42:39.600
- But I like cleaning up.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.267
- I'm less than halfway
done with my French cruller,

42:41.267 --> 42:43.133
I'm not budging, so go.

42:43.133 --> 42:44.700
- It's fine.

42:44.700 --> 42:45.767
- Bye.

42:45.767 --> 42:46.900
- Bye.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.033
- [Helen] Who's next?

42:48.033 --> 42:49.567
- [Percy] Oh, I'd like to go.

42:49.567 --> 42:53.133
Okay, is it a deal breaker
if the guy has no teeth?

42:53.133 --> 42:56.300
(quirky lively music)

43:12.233 --> 43:13.300
- I was waiting for
your guests to leave.

43:13.300 --> 43:14.633
This is a mid-station.
- My god!

43:14.633 --> 43:16.400
- I had nowhere else to go.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.733
- My heart.

43:17.733 --> 43:18.600
- I had nowhere else to go.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.433
I'm sorry.

43:20.467 --> 43:21.667
Everybody's after me.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.133
- I know, I know.

43:23.133 --> 43:24.267
- Wait, you know?

43:24.267 --> 43:25.200
The police just called.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.667
They wanna talk to me.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.400
About you.
- Oh, god!

43:29.267 --> 43:30.100
- What did you do?

43:30.100 --> 43:31.367
- Nothing.

43:31.367 --> 43:32.033
- Nothing?
- No, absolutely nothing.

43:32.033 --> 43:33.267
I swear to you.

43:33.267 --> 43:35.267
- Well, but they
said you ran away.

43:35.267 --> 43:36.500
- Yeah, I did.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.300
Do you think I could
hide out in your house

43:37.300 --> 43:37.833
for a little while?

43:37.833 --> 43:39.100
- No!

43:39.100 --> 43:40.133
- No, I mean after
your guests leave.

43:40.133 --> 43:41.067
- No!
- Well, okay, then.

43:41.067 --> 43:42.200
Well, you better start going.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.033
- Where?

43:43.033 --> 43:44.300
- To the police station.

43:44.300 --> 43:44.967
They're expecting
you, aren't they?

43:44.967 --> 43:45.767
Talk to them.

43:45.767 --> 43:46.567
- You talk to them!

43:46.567 --> 43:47.500
They're looking for you!

43:47.500 --> 43:48.433
- I can't, they'll arrest me.

43:48.433 --> 43:49.367
- Why, if you did nothing?

43:49.367 --> 43:51.333
- Because they think I did.

43:51.333 --> 43:54.567
They think he's
missing because of me.

43:54.567 --> 43:56.067
What kind of a town is this?

43:56.067 --> 43:57.667
I walk into a bar and
everyone's pointing at me

43:57.667 --> 43:58.800
and shouting about Clint Coburn

43:58.800 --> 44:00.200
and then some guy lunges at me.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.600
It's a nightmare.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.133
And I just ran.

44:04.133 --> 44:06.100
I just left my car
there and I ran.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.033
And it's not even my car.

44:07.033 --> 44:08.600
It's my idiot brother's car.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.067
I'm so tired of myself.

44:11.067 --> 44:12.633
Why am I like this?

44:29.667 --> 44:32.933
- How much money does
Clint Coburn owe?

44:34.867 --> 44:37.667
- How do you know he owes money?

44:37.667 --> 44:39.767
- Well, isn't it obvious?

44:40.733 --> 44:42.000
- Is it?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.533
- You don't know him,
you're looking for him,

44:43.533 --> 44:45.300
you seem all mysterious.

44:45.300 --> 44:46.500
- Mysterious, really?

44:46.500 --> 44:47.967
- Yes!

44:47.967 --> 44:49.867
- Mysterious in a
threatening kinda way?

44:49.867 --> 44:52.100
- Yes, I would say you
seem threatening, yes.

44:52.100 --> 44:55.200
- All right, well, I'm
happy to hear you say that.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.400
'Cause, these aren't
even my pants.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.200
I think I can do this.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.900
I just gotta find him.

44:59.900 --> 45:02.667
That's all, just
get this over with.

45:02.667 --> 45:03.667
Where is he?

45:04.833 --> 45:06.333
Where is this man?

45:10.467 --> 45:14.000
- [Lucy] I'm turning
into the parking lot.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.133
Oh, lordie, lay low, lay low.

45:16.133 --> 45:16.967
- I'm low, I'm low.

45:16.967 --> 45:17.800
- [Lucy] Lower!

45:17.800 --> 45:19.800
- No, there isn't lower.

45:27.167 --> 45:28.800
- Hey, Lucy!
- Hey!

45:28.800 --> 45:29.633
- I've come to offer you

45:29.633 --> 45:31.233
my personal support.

45:31.233 --> 45:32.767
I nearly tackled the
lunatic in the bar

45:32.767 --> 45:33.633
but he stiff-armed me.

45:33.633 --> 45:34.533
- Mm-hmm.

45:34.533 --> 45:35.367
- He's gigantic.

45:35.367 --> 45:36.300
- Oh.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.033
- Come on, I'll walk you in.

45:37.033 --> 45:37.867
- Okay.

45:40.567 --> 45:43.500
- So, he got out of his car,

45:43.500 --> 45:44.900
and when he came
over to your car,

45:44.900 --> 45:47.567
his face was covered with blood.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.500
- I wouldn't say
covered with blood.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.567
He was bleeding a little.

45:53.767 --> 45:56.567
- Did you ever look in his car?

45:56.567 --> 45:57.400
- No.

45:57.400 --> 45:58.467
- No?

45:58.467 --> 45:59.300
- No.

46:00.633 --> 46:04.633
- And so it is possible
that Clint Coburn

46:04.633 --> 46:05.800
was already in that car,

46:05.800 --> 46:07.300
and that the blood was caused

46:07.300 --> 46:09.900
by a struggle
between the two men.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.500
- Howard, why would he be
looking for Clint Coburn

46:12.500 --> 46:15.300
if Clint Coburn was
sitting right in his car?

46:15.300 --> 46:17.167
- To throw you off the track.

46:17.167 --> 46:19.467
- Off what track, Howard?

46:19.467 --> 46:22.133
- See, you have no feel for this

46:22.133 --> 46:24.633
because you have
absolutely no aptitude

46:24.633 --> 46:26.467
whatsoever for deceit.

46:27.633 --> 46:29.367
You believe that
the world is good

46:29.367 --> 46:31.000
and that good people
tell the truth.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.267
- Howard, I have
people at my house.

46:34.267 --> 46:35.367
- Okay, Lucy.

46:36.533 --> 46:40.067
I just wanna thank
you for coming down.

46:40.067 --> 46:40.900
God damn.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.567
I like the looks of your hair.

46:44.567 --> 46:45.833
Is that a crime?

46:45.833 --> 46:46.667
No.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.033
- [Willie] Yeah, I'd have
kept running after him,

46:49.033 --> 46:50.300
but I tripped on my shoelace.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.133
- [Lucy] Oh.

46:51.133 --> 46:52.600
- Yeah.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.367
Hey, where's my bike?

46:56.800 --> 46:58.567
Someone stole my bike.

46:59.933 --> 47:00.767
Howard!

47:01.767 --> 47:02.600
Howard!

47:04.600 --> 47:08.033
(mellow uplifting music)

48:22.233 --> 48:25.500
- [Rydell] I'm not
behaving rationally.

48:29.667 --> 48:31.767
- Art is the human effort

48:33.267 --> 48:36.967
to position forms, sounds,
colours, and other elements

48:36.967 --> 48:41.133
into an entity that manipulates
the sense of beauty.

48:47.100 --> 48:50.100
- Did you come here
to tell me that?

48:50.933 --> 48:51.767
- No.

48:54.267 --> 48:56.500
- Then why'd you come here?

48:58.533 --> 48:59.767
- I don't know.

49:06.767 --> 49:07.833
What did you mean when you said

49:07.833 --> 49:10.500
that you were tired of yourself?

49:34.533 --> 49:36.067
- Okay.

49:36.067 --> 49:37.500
Here's the big
joke in my family.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.767
My parents work in the
iron and steel business.

49:40.767 --> 49:42.900
My mother irons.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.100
My father steals.

49:45.100 --> 49:46.967
Decent joke, right?

49:46.967 --> 49:48.833
The thing is, it's
not really a joke.

49:48.833 --> 49:50.733
It's kinda the truth.

49:50.733 --> 49:52.967
My mom stays home.

49:52.967 --> 49:54.367
My dad's a crook.

49:55.433 --> 49:56.833
I have three older brothers.

49:56.833 --> 49:58.100
They're crooks too.

49:58.100 --> 49:59.033
They hate it when
I call them that.

49:59.033 --> 49:59.967
They say, "Bookies, asshole.

49:59.967 --> 50:01.233
"We're professionals gamblers."

50:01.233 --> 50:02.067
Fine.

50:03.100 --> 50:05.267
When I was little,

50:05.267 --> 50:06.967
my brothers would jump on me

50:06.967 --> 50:08.433
and Randy would
hold down my arms

50:08.433 --> 50:09.900
and Craig would
hold down my legs

50:09.900 --> 50:11.533
and my oldest brother Jamie
would stick his fingers

50:11.533 --> 50:12.800
into my armpits and tickle me

50:12.800 --> 50:14.100
and tickle me and tickle me

50:14.100 --> 50:16.767
until I did not have
enough air for noise.

50:16.767 --> 50:18.633
And I thought, I
actually thought this,

50:18.633 --> 50:21.267
I'm going to die,
I'm going to die.

50:21.267 --> 50:22.800
My dad would see this,

50:22.800 --> 50:24.000
and he'd say, "You're being
tickled, for Christ's sake.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.467
"Laugh, god damn it, laugh."

50:25.467 --> 50:28.833
Everyone's laughing
and I'm not laughing.

50:28.833 --> 50:30.400
I wrote a poem.

50:30.400 --> 50:34.200
I wrote a poem for my date
to the high school prom.

50:34.200 --> 50:35.800
And my brothers found this

50:35.800 --> 50:37.100
and they posted it
on the bulletin board

50:37.100 --> 50:39.300
like it was the funniest
thing they'd ever seen.

50:39.300 --> 50:41.067
And I don't even know
why I'm telling you

50:41.067 --> 50:42.033
all this right now.

50:42.033 --> 50:43.233
Except that's how I feel,

50:43.233 --> 50:46.033
like I don't have
enough breath for noise.

50:46.033 --> 50:47.200
So, here I am.

50:48.700 --> 50:49.967
There's blood caked in my hair,

50:49.967 --> 50:51.333
I'm sleeping in a tiny
car that's not mine,

50:51.333 --> 50:52.600
I'm stealing bicycles,

50:52.600 --> 50:54.033
townspeople are chasing
me through the streets

50:54.033 --> 50:57.367
while I search for
someone who doesn't exist.

50:57.367 --> 50:58.167
Why?

50:59.533 --> 51:01.867
Because everyone in my family
wants me to be something

51:01.867 --> 51:03.333
that I can't be.

51:03.333 --> 51:04.600
Can not be!

51:04.600 --> 51:05.433
Can not!

51:06.733 --> 51:09.500
And I don't have the
balls to say fuck off.

51:09.500 --> 51:10.767
Fuck off, everyone.

51:10.767 --> 51:12.567
I want different things.

51:12.567 --> 51:14.367
You know, my dad
cheats on my mom

51:14.367 --> 51:16.533
and my mom cheats on my dad,

51:16.533 --> 51:17.767
my brothers cheat on their wives

51:17.767 --> 51:18.733
and their wives
cheat on my brothers

51:18.733 --> 51:19.833
and all they do with their lives

51:19.833 --> 51:21.400
is make lots and lots of money.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.467
From nothing but
other money and I say,

51:22.467 --> 51:23.700
I want nothing to do with it.

51:23.700 --> 51:24.633
They keep on saying,

51:24.633 --> 51:26.133
"Taste it, taste it, taste it.

51:26.133 --> 51:27.167
"Just once and if you don't
like it, you can spit it out."

51:27.167 --> 51:28.000
And I'm spitting it out.

51:28.000 --> 51:28.933
I don't like it.

51:28.933 --> 51:29.667
I want something different.

51:29.667 --> 51:31.067
I hate it.

51:31.067 --> 51:32.433
You know, I wanna
be someone who says,

51:32.433 --> 51:34.433
hey, how about adding something
good to the shit-pile?

51:34.433 --> 51:35.700
And you know what, you're wrong,

51:35.700 --> 51:37.300
it's a fine poem and
here's what I want,

51:37.300 --> 51:38.567
and here's what I'm gonna do,

51:38.567 --> 51:40.000
and this is who I wanna
be and this is who I am.

51:40.000 --> 51:40.967
But do I say these things?

51:40.967 --> 51:42.067
No, I do not!

51:43.300 --> 51:45.133
Why can't I be the guy
who says those things?

51:45.133 --> 51:47.667
I am so fucking tired of me.

51:47.667 --> 51:49.767
And all I wanna do at
this particular moment

51:49.767 --> 51:52.267
in my particular life is this.

51:54.367 --> 51:56.700
(screaming)

52:04.567 --> 52:06.733
(panting)

52:15.967 --> 52:18.300
(screaming)

52:27.267 --> 52:29.433
(panting)

52:39.567 --> 52:43.733
- Clint Coburn is in a hole in
the living room of my house.

52:44.700 --> 52:47.467
(cheerful music)

53:04.233 --> 53:06.033
(phone beeping)

53:06.033 --> 53:07.033
- [Clint] Lucy!

53:07.033 --> 53:09.267
Lucy, is that you?

53:09.267 --> 53:10.133
- Uh-huh.

53:10.133 --> 53:10.967
Yeah, yes.

53:12.300 --> 53:14.100
It's me all right, I'm back.

53:14.100 --> 53:15.767
- [Clint] Lucy,
do not say a thing

53:15.767 --> 53:17.600
until I say one word to you,

53:17.600 --> 53:20.833
one magic word that will
unlock your treasure box

53:20.833 --> 53:23.067
and free your gems and guide,
oh, god, can you hear me?

53:23.067 --> 53:26.033
Now I'm talking like
a poet or something.

53:26.033 --> 53:27.233
Because down here,

53:27.233 --> 53:28.800
there are no distractions.

53:28.800 --> 53:30.033
No sensations.

53:30.033 --> 53:31.900
No nothing except
for my whiskers

53:31.900 --> 53:33.267
starting to itch a little

53:33.267 --> 53:34.667
and I'm starving for a
cheeseburger, that kinda thing.

53:34.667 --> 53:36.033
But except for that,

53:36.033 --> 53:39.267
what I am is just
a floating chunk

53:39.267 --> 53:42.100
of unbelievably pure clarity.

53:42.100 --> 53:43.700
(Clint laughing)

53:43.700 --> 53:46.800
Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I
wanna be with you.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.567
I wanna hold you.

53:48.567 --> 53:50.700
I wanna wrap my arms around you.

53:50.700 --> 53:52.700
I wanna suck your entire
head into my mouth

53:52.700 --> 53:54.733
and run my tongue
around you like a,

53:54.733 --> 53:56.800
like a fucking lollipop.

53:56.800 --> 54:00.167
I mean, do you hear how
I'm phrasing things now?

54:00.167 --> 54:02.633
Oh, and here's the magic word

54:02.633 --> 54:06.333
that I wanna say to you that
I see with such clarity.

54:06.333 --> 54:07.167
Jump.

54:08.533 --> 54:09.600
Jump!

54:09.600 --> 54:11.133
Be with me!

54:11.133 --> 54:13.467
It will be like
loving in dreams.

54:13.467 --> 54:15.233
Holding each other, naked,

54:15.233 --> 54:18.633
floating alone in the
blackness, forever!

54:29.033 --> 54:31.467
- Where are you going?

54:31.467 --> 54:33.367
- I stole a bike.

54:33.367 --> 54:34.900
I'm gonna return it.

54:34.900 --> 54:36.133
You know, it seems like

54:36.133 --> 54:37.433
you got a lot on your
plate at the moment

54:37.433 --> 54:38.600
so you don't need
me in your hair.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.100
- You're not in my hair.

54:40.100 --> 54:41.300
You're not.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.400
And Clint Coburn
is not on my plate.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.067
He's never been on my plate.

54:45.067 --> 54:45.900
Never.

54:45.900 --> 54:46.733
I just.

54:59.833 --> 55:01.633
- Freeze, police!

55:01.633 --> 55:02.733
- Howard!

55:02.733 --> 55:05.067
- Lucy, clear the area!

55:05.067 --> 55:08.533
Dude, back away from
the merchandise!

55:08.533 --> 55:09.467
Hands high!

55:10.533 --> 55:12.033
Reach for the sky!

55:13.433 --> 55:17.533
Do not make me do what
I do not want to do!

55:17.533 --> 55:18.467
- Howard, good lord,

55:18.467 --> 55:20.633
there's no need for a gun!

55:24.200 --> 55:27.000
- You left your bag
at the precinct, girl!

55:27.000 --> 55:29.233
Do not come and get it yet!

55:32.767 --> 55:34.033
Tough guy, huh?

55:36.000 --> 55:37.433
I had a hunch, girl.

55:37.433 --> 55:38.367
You okay?

55:38.367 --> 55:40.167
- Howard, he's done nothing.

55:40.167 --> 55:41.467
- Here, I got it.

55:41.467 --> 55:42.900
- Oh.

55:42.900 --> 55:45.567
And then, where is Clint Coburn?

55:46.700 --> 55:47.633
- He's--

55:47.633 --> 55:49.567
- Swell question, officer.

55:49.567 --> 55:52.333
Where could that
Clint Coburn be?

55:53.467 --> 55:55.133
- Well, that's cute.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.033
Get in there, huh.

56:02.733 --> 56:05.600
You got a lot of courage, girl.

56:05.600 --> 56:08.100
I'm afraid there's gonna
be a lot of questions,

56:08.100 --> 56:09.467
a lot of paperwork.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.767
We'll do it together.

56:10.767 --> 56:11.767
Make it fun.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.433
Okay.

56:15.833 --> 56:17.400
Just, up, up we go.

56:22.433 --> 56:23.267
Phew!

56:24.500 --> 56:25.433
Here we go.

56:30.467 --> 56:32.367
All right, be safe now.

56:35.233 --> 56:36.433
Whoop.

56:36.433 --> 56:37.367
- [Rydell] You
dropped something.

56:37.367 --> 56:39.100
- [Howard] Dropped it.

56:39.100 --> 56:39.933
Whoo!

56:43.033 --> 56:44.267
- [Rydell] How you doing?

56:44.267 --> 56:47.533
- [Howard] Why don't
you watch your mouth?

56:58.400 --> 56:59.267
- Hi.

56:59.267 --> 57:00.467
Hi, Ms. Sherrington.

57:00.467 --> 57:01.667
I have to talk to you right now.

57:01.667 --> 57:02.833
- Alex!

57:02.833 --> 57:05.633
- I know about
Coach Coburn, okay?

57:11.300 --> 57:13.967
- You know what about
Coach Coburn, Alex?

57:13.967 --> 57:15.467
- That you killed him,

57:15.467 --> 57:18.767
but that doesn't matter
to me because I love you.

57:18.767 --> 57:21.333
Oh great, now they've got dogs.

57:21.333 --> 57:22.267
Oh, you know what?

57:22.267 --> 57:23.433
I have got a spot right nearby

57:23.433 --> 57:25.000
that nobody knows about
where we can hide.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.233
- Dogs?

57:26.233 --> 57:27.300
- Yeah, listen,
you can hear them.

57:27.300 --> 57:30.667
(dogs barking)

57:30.667 --> 57:33.067
I'll be 40 when you're 53.

57:33.067 --> 57:34.100
That's not bad, right?

57:34.100 --> 57:34.933
- Alex.

57:36.067 --> 57:38.633
Coach Coburn is not dead.

57:38.633 --> 57:39.467
He's in my house.

57:39.467 --> 57:40.967
He fell in a hole.

57:41.867 --> 57:42.700
- A hole?

57:46.733 --> 57:47.567
- Listen.

57:47.567 --> 57:49.933
- [Clint] Where are you?

57:49.933 --> 57:50.767
Lucy!

57:53.667 --> 57:54.667
- Okay.

57:54.667 --> 57:55.500
- [Clint] Where are you?

57:55.500 --> 57:56.333
- Okay.

57:58.667 --> 57:59.967
We go to my secret spot anyway.

57:59.967 --> 58:01.467
It's okay that Coach
Coburn isn't dead.

58:01.467 --> 58:03.833
I mean, we can go there even
if you just wanna rest there,

58:03.833 --> 58:06.067
get away from the search party.

58:06.067 --> 58:08.067
It's not far, I promise.

58:11.767 --> 58:12.600
Okay.

58:20.900 --> 58:24.833
- I don't wanna hear a
single peep, little bird.

58:24.833 --> 58:25.667
- No.

58:25.667 --> 58:26.600
- No, what?

58:27.667 --> 58:28.467
Yeah.

58:32.467 --> 58:34.200
- [Clint] No, no,
not a lollipop,

58:34.200 --> 58:35.667
I should've said Popsicle.

58:35.667 --> 58:38.133
I should've said Popsicle.

58:38.133 --> 58:38.967
That makes much more sense.

58:38.967 --> 58:39.967
(knocking on door)

58:39.967 --> 58:40.833
Hello?

58:40.833 --> 58:41.767
- [Elliot] Clint?

58:41.767 --> 58:43.567
Is that you in there, coach?

58:43.567 --> 58:44.433
- [Clint] No!

58:44.433 --> 58:45.867
Mayor, it is not.

58:47.033 --> 58:48.367
Everything is very
normal in here.

58:48.367 --> 58:50.100
- Let's go, let's go.

58:52.733 --> 58:54.333
What in god's name?

58:56.233 --> 58:58.900
(cheerful music)

59:10.300 --> 59:13.200
- This hole is invigorating.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.600
It's scientifically
invigorating.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.433
- [Clint] Well, then jump on
in if it's so invigorating.

59:18.433 --> 59:20.267
Invigorating, my ass.

59:20.267 --> 59:21.333
- I was just.

59:22.467 --> 59:25.300
- [Clint] I'm sorry everybody.

59:25.300 --> 59:26.967
I didn't mean that
bit about my ass.

59:26.967 --> 59:28.933
- Hey, no problem.

59:28.933 --> 59:31.967
It's all guys up here, coach.

59:31.967 --> 59:32.933
It's John here.

59:32.933 --> 59:34.933
- [Clint] Yeah, thanks, John.

59:34.933 --> 59:36.933
- Are you fishing around, Clint?

59:36.933 --> 59:39.467
- [Clint] I sure am, Mr. Mayor!

59:39.467 --> 59:42.533
(light mellow music)

59:56.400 --> 59:57.900
- It just opened up.

59:57.900 --> 59:58.900
It's so odd.

01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.800
It's so strange.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:04.433
- Wow.

01:00:04.433 --> 01:00:07.000
- But Clint was at
my house because,

01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:13.133
we were about to have an affair.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.100
- Yeah, we guessed that.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.133
- You did?

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:19.300
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.267
- It was pretty clear.
- Oh, for sure.

01:00:21.267 --> 01:00:24.633
- I mean, Verna and everything.

01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:26.433
How could I have
done that to her?

01:00:26.433 --> 01:00:27.267
- Oh.

01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:31.500
- I told him I loved him.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.867
- Who doesn't do that?

01:00:32.867 --> 01:00:34.967
- [Fay] That's no big deal.

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:37.467
- Don't you think
that's a very big thing,

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.833
to tell someone you love him?

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.733
- Well, sweetie you
made a hopeful guess.

01:00:40.733 --> 01:00:42.667
- Who hasn't guessed
wrong, right?

01:00:42.667 --> 01:00:43.567
- I do all the time.

01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:44.533
- Yeah.

01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:45.500
- Because listen to this,

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.767
it's not even 24 hours later

01:00:46.767 --> 01:00:49.833
and now his voice
makes my skin crawl.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.833
How can that be?

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:56.267
How could I have said
I love you to this man?

01:00:56.267 --> 01:00:58.833
- Listen, that
skin crawling part,

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.067
that can take years to get to.

01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:02.233
You're very lucky.

01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:03.067
- Yeah.

01:01:06.533 --> 01:01:10.467
- I don't know anything
about anything.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:11.900
- [Clint] No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.000
Now Verna, blow your nose, okay?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.533
Everything's okay, just blow.

01:01:15.533 --> 01:01:17.267
- I will, I am, I am.

01:01:17.267 --> 01:01:20.367
(Verna blowing nose)

01:01:21.867 --> 01:01:24.400
I microwaved some lasagna.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.833
- [Clint] Lasagna, yummy.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.400
- [Verna] But you
didn't come home.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.333
- [Clint] Well, honey, how
could I come home, okay?

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:32.333
I'm in a hole.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.333
Verna, sweetie, do
not worry, all right,

01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:35.667
they're gonna get
me out of here.

01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:37.733
We got a great fire department.

01:01:37.733 --> 01:01:38.967
- Of course.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:40.700
They're gonna get
you out of here.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.100
- [Fireman] Yeah, we do.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.933
- Sweetie.

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:46.333
What were you doing here?

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.900
- [Clint] Here?

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.567
- Yeah because you said you
were going to the school so.

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:52.967
- [Clint] Well, I
went to the school.

01:01:52.967 --> 01:01:55.333
I went there and I
watched the game films.

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:58.167
Ask Herb, the janitor,
I think he saw me.

01:01:58.167 --> 01:02:01.633
You know, but this hole is what
we should be talking about.

01:02:01.633 --> 01:02:02.567
What is it?

01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:05.933
- Yes.

01:02:05.933 --> 01:02:07.167
What is it?

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:08.900
What is this hole?

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.333
How can this be?

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.033
- [Elliot] Well, we
don't know, Verna.

01:02:12.033 --> 01:02:13.267
- Oh, hey.

01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:14.433
- All we know at
the present moment

01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:17.367
is that there is a
hole and Clint's in it.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.267
- And it just opened up?

01:02:20.267 --> 01:02:23.167
- [Clint] She just
opened right up.

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:25.667
- Huh.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.733
Sweetie, what were
you doing here?

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.900
- [Clint] Doing?

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.967
- Yes, when it opened up,

01:02:35.933 --> 01:02:37.267
what were you,

01:02:37.267 --> 01:02:40.367
why were you here at
Lucy Sherrington's house

01:02:40.367 --> 01:02:41.933
when it opened up?

01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:45.667
I guess, is what I'm a
little confused about.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.200
- [Clint] Well,
because Ms. Sherrington

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.000
is the art teacher, that's why.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.833
Where else would I go?

01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:54.367
- Go for what?

01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:55.567
- [Clint] For what?

01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:57.067
For the dummies.

01:02:57.067 --> 01:02:58.267
Look, is this important?

01:02:58.267 --> 01:03:00.667
I'm in a hole, for god sakes.

01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:03.667
- What dummies?

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:05.867
- [Clint] I told you
about the dummies,

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:07.300
I know I did.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.300
The paper mache blocking
dummies for the football team.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.967
Look, is that rope still coming?

01:03:15.933 --> 01:03:17.600
- Is Lucy available?

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.033
- Are you out of your mind?

01:03:22.033 --> 01:03:23.833
The thing sucked
him out of thin air.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.300
It's obviously an act of god,

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.033
everybody knows that.

01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:28.967
UFO?

01:03:28.967 --> 01:03:30.667
I mean, who ever heard of a UFO

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:33.300
just sittin' there
letting you look at it?

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.900
- I'm just saying maybe
it's from outer space.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.300
- I don't think so.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.667
- I say the entire thing
is an optical illusion.

01:03:40.667 --> 01:03:43.100
- Yeah, well, I'll tell
you what the hole is

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.300
and I'll tell you right now

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.000
and there's no if
ands or buts about it.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.633
It's a mouth!

01:03:47.633 --> 01:03:48.667
It's saying,

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:51.267
"Just shut up you little fools.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.267
"Just stop trying to make
sense out of everything

01:03:55.267 --> 01:03:57.867
"and go outside in the moonlight

01:03:59.267 --> 01:04:02.667
"and make love in a corn
field before some hole comes

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:04.667
"and swallows you down."

01:04:05.867 --> 01:04:07.133
- [Jerry] Get that
man another beer.

01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:08.933
(group laughs)

01:04:08.933 --> 01:04:12.000
- Yeah, well, everybody can
laugh but I got four kids

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.200
and to tell you the truth,

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.400
I don't know why
we're not calling in

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.467
the National Guard or somebody.

01:04:16.467 --> 01:04:18.833
- Well, Vernon, you're
the science teacher.

01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:23.000
Do you think the hole poses
a threat to our community?

01:04:24.467 --> 01:04:27.167
- I think this
hole, in my opinion,

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:31.100
poses a threat to nothing
but our arrogance.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.067
You know, we think we
can know everything.

01:04:34.067 --> 01:04:38.067
We think we can cage
everything with words.

01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:40.733
You might as well ask me in
a language I've never heard,

01:04:40.733 --> 01:04:43.500
to describe, in a
language I don't speak,

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.567
the taste of a food
I've never eaten.

01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:50.200
And what we have, in my opinion,

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.967
in the floor of Lucy
Sherrington's home,

01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:57.067
is a peephole into the vast
landscape of our ignorance.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.733
It's an exhilarating
and humbling view

01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.500
into our frailty
and limitations.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.400
That's what I think the hole is.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.900
(mellow orchestral music)

01:05:43.033 --> 01:05:44.500
- Here.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.433
It's cocoa.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.200
Were you warm enough last night?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.700
- Yes, I was, yes.

01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:58.567
It's a wonderful sleeping bag.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.633
Oh, Alex.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.400
I'm wearing your pyjamas

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.933
and my hair's all stringy
and my mouth's all mossy

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.033
and I'm behaving
like a crazy lady.

01:06:15.933 --> 01:06:19.367
What do you think of
Ms. Sherrington now?

01:06:21.767 --> 01:06:23.200
- It's different.

01:06:27.267 --> 01:06:28.833
- What is?

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:30.067
- Being here with you.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:33.200
It's different than I
thought it would be.

01:06:36.533 --> 01:06:40.433
- It's always different
than you think, Alex.

01:06:40.433 --> 01:06:42.900
You think about doing
something and then you do it

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.800
and it's always different
than what you thought.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.833
Always.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:48.333
Absolutely always.

01:06:50.467 --> 01:06:51.300
- Then,

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:56.900
how can anybody
ever make a promise?

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:05.233
- The jamboree.

01:07:05.233 --> 01:07:08.667
(lively uplifting music)

01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.433
- Afraid that's it.

01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:48.033
- What's it?

01:07:48.033 --> 01:07:49.233
- We're out.

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:50.900
- [Clint] What do you mean out?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.333
- Outta things to tie together,

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:54.100
it looks like, coach.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.667
- [Clint] Out?

01:07:55.667 --> 01:07:56.967
Out?

01:07:56.967 --> 01:07:58.467
- For now, anyways.

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:00.667
Plus mayor, the
jamboree's starting up.

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.233
- [Clint] Well,
fuck the jamboree!

01:08:02.233 --> 01:08:03.067
Drapes!

01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:05.233
Tie drapes together!

01:08:05.233 --> 01:08:06.833
I'm sorry.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.200
I'm sorry, that was
way out of line.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.633
I'm just,

01:08:09.633 --> 01:08:13.267
I am going ape-shit
down here, okay?

01:08:13.267 --> 01:08:15.700
I just, I need to get
a message to Verna.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.133
Is that possible?

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.899
All right, I need to tell
her that I made a mistake.

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:23.832
- You stay tight
down there, coach.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.966
Everyone's going
to the jamboree.

01:08:25.966 --> 01:08:27.267
And as soon as it's over,

01:08:27.267 --> 01:08:29.933
I guarantee you we're
gonna string together

01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:34.100
every last thing in this
town that has two ends on it.

01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:38.067
And that's a promise
from the mayor.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.233
- [Clint] One nine,
breaker one nine,

01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:45.633
Coach Coburn to John.

01:08:45.633 --> 01:08:46.899
John you read me?

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:47.767
- I read you, coach.

01:08:47.767 --> 01:08:48.867
Loud and clear.

01:08:48.867 --> 01:08:49.899
You read me?

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:52.433
- [Clint] Loud and clear, John.

01:08:52.433 --> 01:08:53.667
- [John] Keep it
coming, big fella.

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:54.500
Gimme more.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.733
- [Clint] Okay.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:01.000
* O say can you see by
the dawn's early light

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:10.633
* What so proudly we hailed

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:21.600
- [Elliot] Hole or no hole,

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.933
let's raise the roof for
our own Coach Coburn!

01:09:25.933 --> 01:09:28.000
(people applauding and cheering)

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.200
- [Clint] Thank you, mayor.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.533
Thank you very much for
that fantastic poem.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:35.600
Now as all of you probably
know by now, I am in a hole.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.033
A very strange hole indeed.

01:09:37.033 --> 01:09:39.200
And maybe poetry is
just the thing we need

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.033
when the hour seems dark.

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:44.533
I'm reminded of the
poem Casey At The Bat.

01:09:44.533 --> 01:09:47.567
And while it doesn't
deal with a hole per se,

01:09:47.567 --> 01:09:50.267
and it's baseball not football,

01:09:50.267 --> 01:09:52.399
Casey does strike out at the end

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.967
which is something we
are not going to do

01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:57.233
tomorrow afternoon
against Roseville High!

01:09:57.233 --> 01:10:01.933
(crowd applauding and cheering)

01:10:01.933 --> 01:10:05.367
Now I want you to know that
I don't get choked up a lot

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.033
and maybe it's because
I'm floating around

01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:08.867
like a fart in the
middle of the night,

01:10:08.867 --> 01:10:12.900
but your applause coupled
with those honking horns

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.400
actually produced a
lump in my throat.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.833
- [Crowd] Aw.

01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:18.233
- And who actually produced
a lump in your pants,

01:10:18.233 --> 01:10:22.000
you stinking, lying,
cheating stick of horseshit?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.100
Lucy Sherrington, that's who!

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:24.933
- [Clint] Hello?

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:26.367
What's happening?

01:10:26.367 --> 01:10:27.300
Hello?

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.867
- Paper mache, my big fat ass.

01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:31.733
You were at Lucy
Sherrington's house

01:10:31.733 --> 01:10:35.067
for one reason and
one reason only, sex!

01:10:36.267 --> 01:10:38.000
- [Clint] Verna, Verna, wait!

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.633
Verna, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:10:39.633 --> 01:10:40.733
- All of you!

01:10:40.733 --> 01:10:42.033
You all should be ashamed

01:10:42.033 --> 01:10:45.200
for not knowing exactly
what that hole is!

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.300
Ashamed!

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.267
- [Clint] Somebody, anybody!

01:10:47.267 --> 01:10:48.767
Just rub her temples!

01:10:48.767 --> 01:10:50.233
- It is a note!

01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:53.900
It is a very clearly
written note from up there.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.633
A note that says, no, no, no.

01:10:55.633 --> 01:10:57.567
Oh no, you don't do that!

01:10:57.567 --> 01:11:00.333
You don't kick
people who love you!

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:02.600
Do not be fooled by beauty!

01:11:03.633 --> 01:11:05.033
Look at me!

01:11:05.033 --> 01:11:06.567
I'm in my slippers.

01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:09.067
My handkerchief weighs a pound.

01:11:09.067 --> 01:11:10.900
Beauty did this to me.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.833
Beauty is empty.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.333
Beauty is cruel.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.233
Love is loving someone
who is covered in snot!

01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:25.100
Snot!

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.033
Snot!

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:29.700
Love me!

01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:31.600
Love me!

01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:34.733
Love me!

01:11:34.733 --> 01:11:35.767
- Yes.

01:11:35.767 --> 01:11:37.167
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:41.800
(people applauding and cheering)

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.200
Verna!

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.333
Listen to Verna!

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:47.100
Verna is right!

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.033
Verna is right about everything!

01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:54.467
Clint Coburn and I were
going to do a terrible thing.

01:11:54.467 --> 01:11:57.400
A horrible, selfish,
terrible thing.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.933
But the hole opened up.

01:12:00.933 --> 01:12:02.967
The hole saved us

01:12:02.967 --> 01:12:05.967
and I am begging you,
Verna, to forgive me.

01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:07.300
To forgive us.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.033
Because love had
nothing to do with it.

01:12:10.033 --> 01:12:11.200
Nothing.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.367
And love can be so lovely.

01:12:14.933 --> 01:12:18.267
And the hope of love
is so heartbreaking

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:21.467
and that's all it was.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:22.667
Hope!

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:24.867
You know when somebody smiles

01:12:24.867 --> 01:12:28.433
and we smile back
and then, whoosh,

01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:32.600
we're gone, sucked
inside somebody else,
helpless, helpless.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.667
And all I want is to cash
a check and it's sex.

01:12:40.567 --> 01:12:43.733
Or to buy some
mayonnaise and it's sex.

01:12:43.733 --> 01:12:46.467
Or to say hello and it's sex!

01:12:46.467 --> 01:12:48.967
Or to put a flower in my hair.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.200
A flower, a simple flower,

01:12:53.367 --> 01:12:56.100
and it all turns to
humping and dogs humping

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.800
and cats jizzing on a curtain.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.933
(crowd gasps)

01:12:58.933 --> 01:13:01.400
And all because of hope.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.900
Sweet, sweet hope

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.767
and Verna, if there is
a better noise to make

01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:11.500
than saying the
words I am sorry,

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.000
then please tell me and
I will make that noise

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.900
again and again and again

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.133
until you know that love
had nothing to do with it.

01:13:21.133 --> 01:13:21.967
Nothing.

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:27.033
And everyone, thank
you for voting for me.

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:28.833
I've been a terrible queen.

01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:29.900
- No.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.567
- And I'm sorry mom and dad

01:13:32.567 --> 01:13:35.967
for making you worry
and for being so crazy

01:13:35.967 --> 01:13:37.633
and for saying jizz.

01:13:39.067 --> 01:13:40.133
- [Crowd] Aw.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.500
- I'm tired of
holding this thing in.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.933
I love you, Lucy!

01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:49.700
And my love is the real thing.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.200
- Yeah, well, I'm the
one that loves her.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.900
She's my Lucy.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.500
- No, she's nobody's Lucy.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.867
Love is not about owning,
it's about freeing.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:00.367
Lucy, I give you your freedom.

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:03.233
- Well, ladies and gentleman,

01:14:03.233 --> 01:14:06.033
hold on to your hats,
because here's a news flash,

01:14:06.033 --> 01:14:08.933
I love Lucy and we're
going to Uganda.

01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:10.200
- [Crowd] What?

01:14:11.433 --> 01:14:12.933
- What?

01:14:12.933 --> 01:14:15.133
- Well, are you willing
to strap yourself

01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:18.100
till the end of time to the
leg of the woman you love?

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.967
I am, that's love!

01:14:19.967 --> 01:14:21.233
- No!

01:14:21.233 --> 01:14:24.167
Love is the eternal echo
of the first heartbeat.

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:26.033
It's the gasping at the soul

01:14:26.033 --> 01:14:28.533
at the illusion of perfection.

01:14:28.533 --> 01:14:30.800
- I just want to point out
that being great in the sack

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.433
hasn't been mentioned.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:35.833
That can make up for a lot of
dead spots down the road, so.

01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:37.833
- [Randy] I second that.

01:14:46.433 --> 01:14:48.267
- Clinton, my husband,

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:52.167
down in that deep dark hole,

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.200
this is your wife, Verna.

01:14:57.433 --> 01:15:01.633
And I will tell you what
love is, because now I know.

01:15:01.633 --> 01:15:04.567
Love is weak, and
love is helpless,

01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:08.233
because all I really want,

01:15:08.233 --> 01:15:11.133
as it turns out,
is you in my arms.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:19.200
- Then I say what Verna wants,

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.433
Verna gets.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:24.633
(crowd applauding and cheering)

01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:28.900
Folks, we have to construct
a lifeline to Clint.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.300
- [Crowd] Yeah!

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.500
- So if you can
tie it, bring it!

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.667
If it's got two ends
on it, we need it!

01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:39.500
If it's hanging from something
else, then disassemble it!

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.067
So unstrap your straps!

01:15:42.067 --> 01:15:43.500
Untether your tethers!

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.933
Unchain your chains!

01:15:44.933 --> 01:15:46.100
(crowd cheering)

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.200
Unleash your dogs!

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.633
(crowd cheering)

01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:52.033
De-belt your pants!

01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:53.433
And if your pants
fall down, well then,

01:15:53.433 --> 01:15:56.533
tie those fallen pants together!

01:15:56.533 --> 01:15:58.300
So pull down your drapes!

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.233
(crowd cheering)

01:15:59.233 --> 01:16:01.367
Unmake your beds!

01:16:01.367 --> 01:16:03.367
Tie your bedspreads together!

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:04.933
Tie your sheets to your sheets

01:16:04.933 --> 01:16:07.267
and your pillowcases
to pillowcases!

01:16:07.267 --> 01:16:08.200
(crowd cheering)

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.400
Everyone!

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.567
To the hole!

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:11.767
- [Everyone] To the hole!

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.433
(crowd applauding and cheering)

01:16:13.433 --> 01:16:15.033
- [Elliot] To the hole!

01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:18.467
(lively uplifting music)

01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:21.033
- [Clint] Wait!

01:16:21.033 --> 01:16:22.967
I got it, I got it!

01:16:22.967 --> 01:16:23.933
- You got it?

01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:25.000
- [Clint] Yes!

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.167
I'm tugging!

01:16:26.167 --> 01:16:28.567
Can you feel me tug?

01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:30.133
- Yeah, he's got it.

01:16:30.133 --> 01:16:31.000
- He's got it!

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.533
- He's got the rope!

01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:34.200
He has got the rope!

01:16:35.233 --> 01:16:37.167
- He's got the rope, folks!

01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:38.400
- Okay.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.233
All right, we're gonna
start to pull now, guys!

01:16:40.233 --> 01:16:41.533
Ready?

01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:42.367
Pull!

01:16:43.367 --> 01:16:46.767
(lively uplifting music)

01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:50.933
(grunting)

01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:05.900
- Ha!

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.400
- He's out!
- He's out!

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.667
- He's out!

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.500
He's out!

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.333
He's out!

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:12.467
(townspeople cheering)

01:17:12.467 --> 01:17:13.433
- Light!

01:17:13.433 --> 01:17:14.567
Oh, god!

01:17:14.567 --> 01:17:15.733
I love the light!

01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:17.800
I love the light!

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.633
Oh!

01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:23.867
- [Elliot And Willie]
One, two, three!

01:17:23.867 --> 01:17:24.700
- Ha!

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.967
(laughing)

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.700
I'm on ground!

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.100
Oh, I love you, ground!

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.133
I love the ground.

01:17:35.133 --> 01:17:36.633
Oh, thank you!

01:17:36.633 --> 01:17:38.300
Thank you, everyone.

01:17:39.133 --> 01:17:41.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Thank you, my wonderful.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:49.467
My wonderful wife.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.967
Down there, alone in the black,

01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:03.067
I heard you say,

01:18:03.067 --> 01:18:05.400
"Love me, love me, love me."

01:18:06.267 --> 01:18:07.833
And I said nothing.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.267
Maybe it's because I don't
really know what love is.

01:18:15.633 --> 01:18:17.200
But this I do know.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.833
If I had a shirt,

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.000
I swear to god,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.500
I would be honoured

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:34.000
for you to blow your nose on it.

01:18:39.733 --> 01:18:40.667
'Cause I love you.

01:18:40.667 --> 01:18:42.900
And I love your snot, I do.

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:49.167
I'm so sorry.

01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:50.167
- I love you, baby.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:52.233
- [Clint] I love you too.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.500
- You're free to go.

01:18:59.433 --> 01:19:01.933
Nothing like family, is there?

01:19:09.233 --> 01:19:12.667
(mellow uplifting music)

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.600
- Let's go.

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:19.667
This way.

01:19:28.467 --> 01:19:29.300
Ready?

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.700
We're reporting live from.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.700
- Lucy Sherrington.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.933
- Yes.

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:47.667
You need to set
Rydell Whyte free.

01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.133
- Already did.

01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:52.067
Had nothing to hold him on
since we located Coach Coburn.

01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:55.067
- Did Rydell say
where he was going?

01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:58.733
- I guess I don't understand
how you can screw up

01:19:58.733 --> 01:20:00.900
such a small potatoes
job like this.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.500
How does it happen?

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:04.833
It's embarrassing.

01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:15.700
Oh, I see, this is.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.633
- All right, please
give me that.

01:20:16.633 --> 01:20:17.567
- See, this is the problem.

01:20:17.567 --> 01:20:18.567
You're still writing this crap.

01:20:18.567 --> 01:20:19.333
- Can you please
give that to me?

01:20:19.333 --> 01:20:20.533
- Hey, stop!

01:20:20.533 --> 01:20:21.533
- Jamie, I mean it.

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:22.400
Give me that back.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.900
- The danger.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:26.500
The danger of a stranger is
a threat of a better life.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.700
- Jamie, I mean it.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.500
Give me that back!
- What does that mean?

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.300
- Give me that back!

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:29.967
Give me that back!

01:20:29.967 --> 01:20:31.300
- Oh.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.700
(tyres screeching)

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:34.867
What the hell?

01:20:36.233 --> 01:20:38.633
You're such an idiot, Rydell.

01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.467
Where are you?

01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:53.300
Come on.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.067
What are you doin'?

01:20:56.067 --> 01:20:57.300
Okay, come on.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.067
Get your little
book and we'll go.

01:21:00.067 --> 01:21:03.400
It's a cold world out
there, you'll see.

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:14.500
(mellow uplifting music)

01:21:48.267 --> 01:21:52.367
- [Rydell] I'm having
trouble not saying goodbye.

01:21:56.233 --> 01:21:57.233
- Come here.

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:12.900
- That's some hole.

01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:17.200
- What is it?

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.400
How can it be?

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.433
- Pyjamas.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.733
- Yes, pyjamas.

01:22:40.067 --> 01:22:41.667
That poem of yours.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.400
That your brothers made fun of.

01:22:48.767 --> 01:22:50.133
Do you know it?

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:51.500
- I do.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.533
It's very short.

01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:55.033
- Could I hear it?

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.467
- [Rydell] Why?

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.467
- I'd just like to hear it.

01:23:06.833 --> 01:23:08.900
- Putting love into words

01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:14.200
is like putting rose
petals into a chipper.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.600
The heart rattles,

01:23:23.033 --> 01:23:24.367
the soul shakes,

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:27.333
and for what?

01:23:31.467 --> 01:23:33.067
Out comes pink goo.

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:52.400
* Stranded in a mystery

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.767
* Searching for something more

01:24:00.733 --> 01:24:04.233
* Maybe this is it for me

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.367
* Could it be what
I've been waiting for

01:24:12.367 --> 01:24:15.100
* One thing I can see

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.833
* You really can't fool gravity

01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:22.000
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:24:23.733 --> 01:24:26.300
* When it comes to you and me

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.300
* Who knows if it is meant to be

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:32.733
* Sing a song in harmony

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.333
* Who can figure it out

01:24:41.033 --> 01:24:45.033
* This world is big as it seems

01:24:47.033 --> 01:24:51.200
* Nobody know what
it's really all about

01:24:52.467 --> 01:24:56.233
* Maybe it's all just a dream

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.667
* Sometimes things
make me wonder

01:25:04.033 --> 01:25:07.433
* How I ever landed here

01:25:09.667 --> 01:25:13.833
* Patiently, I
wait for something

01:25:15.067 --> 01:25:19.067
* Not quite sure it will appear

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.867
* One thing I can see

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:25.867
* You really can't fool gravity

01:25:25.867 --> 01:25:30.033
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:34.133
* When it comes to you and me

01:25:34.133 --> 01:25:37.300
* Who knows if it is meant to be

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.700
* Sing a song in harmony

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:48.067
* Now it seems we
found an answer

01:25:49.833 --> 01:25:53.667
* To a question we don't know

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:59.200
* Could this be
the way to follow

01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:04.467
* Take my hand and we will go

01:26:05.533 --> 01:26:08.100
* One thing I can see

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:11.167
* You really can't fool gravity

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:15.333
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:26:16.867 --> 01:26:19.467
* When it comes to you and me

01:26:19.467 --> 01:26:22.467
* Who knows if it is meant to be

01:26:22.467 --> 01:26:25.900
* Sing a song in harmony

01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:30.733
* One thing I can see

01:26:30.733 --> 01:26:33.833
* You really can't fool gravity

01:26:33.833 --> 01:26:38.000
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:26:39.633 --> 01:26:42.133
* When it comes to you and me

01:26:42.133 --> 01:26:45.300
* Who knows if it is meant to be

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.733
* Sing a song in harmony

01:26:51.033 --> 01:26:53.400
* One thing I can see

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.433
* You really can't fool gravity

01:26:56.433 --> 01:27:00.600
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.933
* When it comes to you and me

01:27:04.933 --> 01:27:07.967
* Who knows if it is meant to be

01:27:07.967 --> 01:27:12.133
* Truth is all we
hope to achieve

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:18.267
* Juliet, lean from your window

01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:22.467
* I wanna see you in
the morning sunlight

01:27:22.467 --> 01:27:26.233
* Better yet, far
from your tower

01:27:26.233 --> 01:27:30.400
* We gotta find a way to
cross this braided lie

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.767
* These lies tearing us apart

01:27:35.767 --> 01:27:38.233
* Shackles on our hearts

01:27:38.233 --> 01:27:41.400
* And shake them free

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.733
* If only ever only up to me

01:27:46.733 --> 01:27:51.000
* I don't care how
stairs I gotta climb

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.767
* My hope becomes an
arrow on this time

01:27:54.767 --> 01:27:58.633
* It's you I think about
with every little note

01:27:58.633 --> 01:28:01.967
* I didn't know it then

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.533
* Juliet, leave from your family

01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:14.733
* We'll hitch a ride and
get away from this place

01:28:14.733 --> 01:28:18.600
* Soon enough, we'll be together

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.767
* It doesn't matter what
it takes to find some peace

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:30.933
* How is it hard,
it's loving from afar

01:28:30.933 --> 01:28:34.400
* I'm lost in dreams

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.067
* If only it were only easy

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.500
* I don't care how many
stairs I gotta climb

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.167
* My hope becomes an
arrow on this time

01:28:47.167 --> 01:28:51.200
* It's you I think
about in every note

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.533
* I didn't know it then

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:14.667
* In the end, we
got what we wanted

01:29:14.667 --> 01:29:18.833
* Is seems so easy when
it fell beyond our reach

01:29:27.233 --> 01:29:31.500
* I don't care how many
stairs I gotta climb

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.100
* My hope becomes an
arrow on this time

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:39.100
* It's you I think about
with every little note

01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.433
* I didn't know it then

01:29:43.567 --> 01:29:47.167
* I don't care how many
stairs I gotta climb

01:29:47.167 --> 01:29:51.233
* My hope becomes an
arrow on this time

01:29:51.233 --> 01:29:55.400
* It's you I think about
with every little note
