[glass shattering]

[ominous music]

02:24.622 --> 02:27.059
- Come on man, you gotta redeem
yourself.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.626
- [Micheal] Na, I don't wanna be
late,

02:28.670 --> 02:30.933
I'm on the same shift as Sonja
Meyers.

02:30.976 --> 02:31.977
You should come by the pool man,

02:32.021 --> 02:33.240
watch your boy put the moves

02:33.283 --> 02:35.981
on one of the world's hottest
life guards.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.548
- Can't man I got chores.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.637
- [Micheal] Brutal, well don't
die man.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.117
- I'll try not to.

02:41.161 --> 02:41.987
Later man.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.338
- [Micheal] Later big homie.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.002
[door creaking]

02:57.046 --> 02:57.873
- Mom.

03:00.789 --> 03:01.616
Rach.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.055
Hello.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.714
[heavy breathing]

03:40.959 --> 03:43.614
[door creaking]

03:48.010 --> 03:48.793
- Hey.

03:48.837 --> 03:49.707
Whoa, please don't!

03:49.751 --> 03:50.839
- Colton!

03:50.882 --> 03:52.884
What the hell are you doing?

03:52.928 --> 03:54.408
- There's a guy mom.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.888
- Oh, I am so, so sorry about
this.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.325
- It's okay.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.501
Hey man, my bad, I was just
looking for the bathroom

04:00.544 --> 04:02.285
and I got kinda lost.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.504
- Would somebody please tell me

04:03.547 --> 04:04.940
what the hell is going on?
- Okay, sorry.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.376
Colton, this is Roger.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.378
Roger, this is my son Colton.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.641
- Hey man, didn't mean to scare
ya.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.121
- What's up dude?

04:12.164 --> 04:13.253
- Roger and I met on,

04:14.471 --> 04:16.255
we're going to Delzano's for a
drink.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.171
- Oh, Delzano's, cool, yeah,
that's great.

04:19.214 --> 04:20.608
Did you get that necklace there?

04:20.651 --> 04:22.784
- Okay, would you just
excuse us just for a minute.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.915
- Sure.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.656
Hey dude, it was nice to meet
you.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.834
- I told him to go through the
side door

04:29.878 --> 04:31.314
'cause I know how much it upsets
you

04:31.358 --> 04:32.837
when I go out with anybody.
- No, not fair.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.448
It's not that, it's the fact
that you meet these people

04:34.491 --> 04:35.840
on a app that my friends use.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.059
- Well, what do you want me do,

04:37.102 --> 04:38.408
wait for your dad to come
crawling back?

04:38.452 --> 04:40.584
- You know I'd slam the
door in his face if he did.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.326
But come on he smells like cedar
chips.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.807
Mom, he's wearing a
safety pin on bracelet.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.287
- Okay, you know what Colton?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.679
I'm really struggling here.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.291
I need you to make this
easier on me, not harder.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.162
Can you just do that for me,
please?

04:53.205 --> 04:53.989
- Fine.

04:54.032 --> 04:54.859
- Here.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.645
Okay, can you just please make
sure

04:57.688 --> 04:59.603
that all the chores are
done in the morning?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.779
- Why do you want me to do all
the lame crap dad used to do?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.346
Why do you want me to be like
that dick?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.260
- You know what,

05:04.304 --> 05:05.305
if you wanna talk like an adult

05:05.348 --> 05:06.741
you better start acting like
one.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.960
Your father was a dick for
leaving us

05:09.004 --> 05:10.832
not for taking care of this
house.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.662
Now do it, please.

05:18.970 --> 05:23.975
- God.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.108
Dad, why we gotta varnish the
chair?

05:26.151 --> 05:27.979
We just did it six months ago.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
Well son, because a man--

05:29.503 --> 05:31.156
[paint splashing]

05:31.200 --> 05:32.157
Shit!

05:32.201 --> 05:35.247
- Ooh, you said the S word.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.858
- Rach, not helpful.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.294
- Okay, mom's home.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.948
She said, "To tell you
when dinner's ready."

05:39.991 --> 05:41.689
But maybe I won't.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.125
- Dammit Rach, seriously.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.127
- You shouldn't swear, what
if the neighbor's hear?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.650
- Yeah, well we don't know them,
okay,

05:46.694 --> 05:48.478
so I guess it doesn't matter.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.175
Just tell mom I'll be in

05:50.219 --> 05:51.351
when I'm done with this, all
right.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.005
And hey, don't tell her about
this.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.442
Deal?

05:55.485 --> 05:56.356
Serious, Rach.

06:09.717 --> 06:12.110
- [Rachel] Colton spilled
that chair stuff--

06:12.154 --> 06:13.285
- Oh my God--
- On the patio today.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.112
- Rachel.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.679
- Take it easy.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.116
Come on you're gonna have to
start getting along better,

06:18.160 --> 06:18.943
starting now.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.162
- Why?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.946
Dropping her off on camp on
Monday.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.994
- The wild fire threat
is too high this year

06:26.037 --> 06:27.909
so camp is canceled.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.214
- That's too bad.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.347
So you're not going to Barcelona
then.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.915
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm going.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.047
Listen as you know things
have not been going great

06:36.091 --> 06:37.135
around here for me lately

06:37.179 --> 06:39.442
so I need this trip with the
girls,

06:39.486 --> 06:40.400
it's only two weeks.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.489
- It's not two weeks, Mom.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.968
It's 16 days.

06:44.012 --> 06:44.795
- [Lisa] Good memory, sweetie.

06:44.839 --> 06:45.883
You're right.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
- Well Mom, what's Rachel gonna
do?

06:47.450 --> 06:50.018
- Well, you're a grownup now,

06:50.061 --> 06:53.456
and as a grownup I need you
to take on this responsibility

06:53.500 --> 06:54.370
that is taking--
- No.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.067
- Care of her and this house.

06:56.111 --> 06:56.894
- What?

06:56.938 --> 06:58.113
- Don't make this worse.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.549
She's already upset about
missing camp.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.681
And you know what,

07:00.724 --> 07:01.551
you're not gonna have this time
together

07:01.595 --> 07:02.552
once you go off to college,

07:02.596 --> 07:03.684
just take advantage of it.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.815
- Take advantage of it.

07:04.859 --> 07:05.642
Mom, you said, "I could have the
house

07:05.686 --> 07:06.600
to myself for two weeks."

07:06.643 --> 07:08.558
- 16 days, dummy.

07:08.602 --> 07:12.301
- Yeah, exactly, 16 days of me
in charge

07:12.344 --> 07:14.738
so watch it, there's
a new sheriff in town.

07:14.782 --> 07:18.742
- Stop, don't act that
way towards your sister.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.266
You know what, I am done
trying to keep the peace

07:21.310 --> 07:22.485
between the both of you anymore.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.573
I just--
- Good.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.835
- You're excused, Colton.

07:24.879 --> 07:25.706
- Thank you.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.144
- Don't forget to take out the
trash.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.672
- [Rachel] Can I have his
dessert?

07:38.066 --> 07:39.284
- Sure you can, sweetie.

08:02.351 --> 08:05.180
- Don't be lamer than you
already are.

08:18.498 --> 08:23.067
Sorry mom, but according
to you I'm an adult now so.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.701
[ominous music]

09:22.344 --> 09:25.216
What's with that creepy
place over there, Mom?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.567
- [Lisa] You mean the old
place across the street.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
- Yeah, did anybody ever live
there,

09:29.003 --> 09:31.005
like before I was born or
anything?

09:31.048 --> 09:33.398
- I don't think I've ever
seen anyone come in or out

09:33.442 --> 09:34.269
since we moved in.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.749
I think it's abandoned.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.273
- That's weird, I saw
something in there last night.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.885
I thought maybe somebody moved
in.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.191
[laughing]

09:43.234 --> 09:45.541
- Oh, you say somebody's
living in that place.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.065
- No man, I saw a light
in there the other night.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.632
You ever seen anybody in there?

09:50.546 --> 09:53.418
- Nope but some skater
kids broke in a while ago.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.245
- [Colton] Yeah.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.683
- Yeah, they all vanished.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.727
Never heard from again.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.424
[laughing]

09:59.468 --> 10:02.732
- No, man I'm serious I
saw a light, all right.

10:02.776 --> 10:03.603
- Light.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.429
- Yeah.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.343
- What light, Colton?

10:05.387 --> 10:06.344
- I don't know, it disappeared.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.432
- Disappeared, huh?

10:08.477 --> 10:09.739
Cool story, Colt.

10:09.783 --> 10:10.914
I always wanted to bust in there

10:10.958 --> 10:13.308
and throw like a lit ass
Halloween party.

10:13.351 --> 10:16.746
Oh, and on that note, taking
the boat out this Saturday.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.052
What's your deal?

10:18.095 --> 10:21.446
- Can't man, mom's going
on a two week vacation

10:21.490 --> 10:23.971
so I gotta babysit my stupid
sister.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.320
- Dude, that's perfect.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.365
You invite somebody over
to keep you company.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.410
They love babysitting.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.672
- Oh yeah, that's great.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.934
Yeah, I'll invite somebody over,

10:30.978 --> 10:32.109
my sister will be a third wheel

10:32.153 --> 10:33.371
it'll be awesome, yeah.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.590
Maybe she can cook for us.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.765
Yeah, Rachel'll cook for us.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.071
That'll be great.
- Hold on, hold on.

10:37.114 --> 10:37.941
Phone ringing.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.335
Look my shift is starting okay.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.119
But we gonna work on that girl
situation.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.033
- Yep.

10:43.077 --> 10:43.947
- [Micheal] Get you a girl, bro.

10:43.991 --> 10:44.818
- Ah-ha.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.544
[ominous music]

11:22.551 --> 11:23.683
What the hell?

11:24.945 --> 11:27.556
[camera snaps]

11:28.644 --> 11:29.471
Oh, shit.

11:31.952 --> 11:32.779
Dammit.

11:38.001 --> 11:38.828
Damn.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.530
- [Lisa] Careful sweetie.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.315
- Maybe a few less rocks next
time.

11:52.189 --> 11:56.454
- Hey, I know this is a lot to
ask

11:56.498 --> 11:59.544
and I didn't mean for you
to have to grow up this fast

11:59.588 --> 12:02.069
but it's just the way things
turned out.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.419
But I wouldn't have asked you to
do this

12:04.462 --> 12:05.986
if I didn't really need it.

12:06.029 --> 12:06.856
- I know, Mom.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.466
- I need you to guarantee me

12:08.510 --> 12:10.425
that you're gonna just take
care of things while I'm gone.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.774
Can I count on you?

12:11.818 --> 12:12.775
- Yes, Mom.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.429
I'll hold it down, I swear.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.432
- I know you will.

12:18.607 --> 12:22.176
Okay, no more backseat driving,
promise.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.569
- I could still use a few
pointers.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.919
- [Rachel] Mom, I'm ready.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.747
- [Colton] All right.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.357
- Tell him.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.098
- [Lisa] Colton, I did tell your
sister

12:31.141 --> 12:33.230
that you would take her
for ice cream after.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.057
- [Colton] All right.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.755
- So you have to.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.365
- [Colton] Only if she's buying.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.282
- [Lisa] Okay, seat belts.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.650
- I have all summer.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.967
[ominous music]

14:47.582 --> 14:48.496
Okay, okay.

15:45.466 --> 15:48.121
[ominous music]

15:55.302 --> 15:58.000
Who moves in all by themselves
in the middle of the night?

15:58.044 --> 15:59.045
- Dude, I don't know.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.350
Maybe you were dreaming.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.048
- No, I know what I saw.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.963
- Hey, doesn't this seem like
overkill?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.313
- I'm responsible for Rachel,
okay.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.575
If there's a midnight creeper

16:07.618 --> 16:09.969
moving in across the
street I need to know.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.407
- [Micheal] Dude, yeah, this
thing cost like over $600.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.409
- Yeah, it's expensive.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.629
- Oh, well if you're splurging
buy me those headphones.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.154
What?

16:21.197 --> 16:22.024
- What?

16:23.678 --> 16:24.853
All right man.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.949
Gonna be worth that 600 bucks
baby.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.909
Gotta get a screw.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.215
All right, got the ladder?

16:40.086 --> 16:45.091
- I got you.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.355
- Want me to do this?

16:48.398 --> 16:49.225
Thank you.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.838
- One more.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.014
Thank you sir.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.199
All right.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.028
And it's good.

17:09.070 --> 17:09.897
- How we do it.

17:12.814 --> 17:13.641
Ooh.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.512
- [Colton] Okay.

17:16.557 --> 17:17.513
[door knocking]

17:17.558 --> 17:20.213
[door creaking]

17:51.592 --> 17:54.725
- Why are you always watching
that house?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.510
I know you made all of that up.

17:58.990 --> 17:59.861
You're weird.

18:02.429 --> 18:07.129
- Rachel, remember what I said
about new sheriff in town.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.522
Think of me as mom now,

18:08.565 --> 18:11.438
meaning if you slip up I can
punish you.

18:11.481 --> 18:16.269
Meaning no more dessert,
no TV, no scoters.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.533
- You're not gonna do it.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.276
You're too scaredy-cat
to even go over there.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.647
- What are you doing?
- Jesus!

19:30.691 --> 19:32.345
I'm Colton.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.434
I live across the street.

19:34.477 --> 19:35.304
Who are you?

19:36.262 --> 19:37.611
- I live here.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.743
Did you just try to get into our
basement?

19:40.962 --> 19:41.789
- No.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.533
I'm sorry, I didn't
think anybody lived here.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.622
Nobody's lived here for a really
long time

19:48.665 --> 19:51.059
and I could've sworn that I saw
this,

19:52.365 --> 19:54.018
you know, I should've knocked.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.194
I really should've knocked.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.674
I'm sorry, I hope I didn't
startle you.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.980
- It's okay.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.547
We just moved in.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.332
We're definitely the first
people to live here in a while.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.203
- Yeah.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.294
Welcome to the neighborhood.

20:10.992 --> 20:11.775
- I'm Heather.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.386
- Oh, Colton.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.479
I'm really sorry, I shoulda
knocked.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.871
- It's okay.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.046
I have to go now.

20:22.090 --> 20:22.917
- Okay.

20:25.659 --> 20:26.486
Sorry.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.062
Yeah, man, I guess it
was her dad that I saw

20:38.106 --> 20:40.543
but the dude was like super old.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.763
But anyway I stopped filming

20:42.806 --> 20:44.591
'cause I don't wanna
be like creep you know.

20:44.634 --> 20:48.247
But if get her on camera then
I'm definitely a creep so.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.640
- [Micheal] Dude, this is money.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.729
I told you this was gonna be
your summer.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.078
Yo, invite her to the lake.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.079
I'm taking the boat out tomorrow

20:55.123 --> 20:56.516
and the whole crew is coming.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.824
- No man, I can't I got Rachel
so.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.740
- [Micheal] Look my mom's
office is closed tomorrow right,

21:03.784 --> 21:05.264
she can watch her for the
afternoon.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.395
The timing is perfect.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.266
- Wait, really?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.354
- [Micheal] Yeah, really.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.746
I got you man.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.271
All right, now get off the couch

21:12.314 --> 21:14.447
and go over there and invite
her.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.709
- How'd you know I was on the
couch?

21:15.752 --> 21:18.277
- [Micheal] Oh, go, go.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.713
- All right, all right, all
right, fine.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.627
- [Micheal] Hang up.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.150
- All right, call you after man.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.750
- Oh.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.969
- Heather, hey.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.319
- [Heather] Hi.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.581
- Oh.
- Are you?

22:01.624 --> 22:02.451
- Oh.

22:05.019 --> 22:05.846
That's nothing.

22:07.543 --> 22:08.370
How's it going?

22:09.502 --> 22:10.546
- Okay.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.809
We're all moved in now I guess.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.028
- Oh, nice.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.118
- Is there something you needed?

22:17.161 --> 22:20.164
- I actually was wondering my
buddy Mike

22:20.208 --> 22:21.340
and his family have a boat

22:21.383 --> 22:22.732
and it's out on the lake

22:22.776 --> 22:26.997
and he, well we are gonna
have a little party,

22:27.041 --> 22:28.347
you know get some people
together,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.827
and I was wondering if,
you know if you're free

22:30.871 --> 22:34.353
if maybe you wanted to come join
us?

22:34.396 --> 22:36.485
But if you have stuff going on

22:36.529 --> 22:38.922
or if you don't want to I
totally get it.

22:38.966 --> 22:43.405
- That's so awesome.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.972
- Great, cool.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.974
Yeah, I can totally drive us.

22:47.017 --> 22:50.107
- I just, I don't think that I
can.

22:50.151 --> 22:51.021
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

22:51.065 --> 22:51.892
- Okay.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.374
Yeah, no worries.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.203
- My dad, he's really strict.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.335
I can't go out much.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.423
- Totally understand.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.859
Yeah, maybe we can find another
time

23:02.903 --> 23:05.601
or you know find something
else to do sometime.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.037
You know something more in line

23:07.081 --> 23:08.822
with your values or whatever.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.173
I get the pushy parents thing.

23:12.216 --> 23:16.220
- It's actually just me and my
dad.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.397
- Oh, oh, cool.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.572
No siblings or anything?

23:20.747 --> 23:22.879
- No, I wish.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.881
- Well, if you're in the market

23:24.925 --> 23:28.276
I got a sister I can
sell to ya pretty cheap.

23:28.319 --> 23:32.019
But a, yeah, so what are you and
your dad

23:32.062 --> 23:33.412
doing this part of town,

23:33.455 --> 23:34.891
if you don't mind me asking?

23:36.197 --> 23:38.721
- Actually the last place
we had was foreclosed on

23:38.765 --> 23:41.289
so we've had a lot of money
problems.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.508
- That sucks.

23:42.551 --> 23:43.726
I'm sorry to hear that, it must
be tough.

23:43.770 --> 23:44.727
- I should go.

23:44.771 --> 23:45.554
- Oh.
- Sorry.

23:45.598 --> 23:46.468
- Okay, yeah, no worries.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.948
I'll just hang out around here

23:47.991 --> 23:50.690
so if you ever wanna hang out.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.260
Bye, Heather.

24:00.613 --> 24:01.440
Stupid.

24:54.884 --> 24:57.496
[ominous music]

25:05.068 --> 25:07.549
[scary music]

25:37.536 --> 25:39.233
- Have you seen Fluffy Ruffles?

25:40.843 --> 25:42.758
She didn't come home yesterday.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.459
Colton, are you listening to me?

25:48.503 --> 25:50.940
- Yes, Rachel, I hear you.

25:52.725 --> 25:56.555
Fluffy Ruffles has ghosted
on us for days you know that.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.425
She'll be back.

26:08.479 --> 26:11.047
[gentle music]

26:37.291 --> 26:39.902
[ominous music]

26:51.218 --> 26:52.306
Oh shit.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.095
Shit.

27:00.749 --> 27:05.754
Oh shit.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.278
- What are--
- Jesus, Rachel!

27:08.322 --> 27:09.889
- What are you doing with all of
this?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.455
- None of your business, okay.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.848
Now go back to your room.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.459
- It doesn't look like any
of your business either.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.028
- Well, it's less of your
business.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.216
- Your science partner is here.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.958
- My what?

27:36.002 --> 27:38.221
- Your science partner,
she's waiting for you.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.440
- School's been out for two
weeks,

27:39.483 --> 27:41.790
I don't have a science partner.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.531
- She said she was.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.054
She's waiting in the TV room.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.187
- [Colton] Oh.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.501
- Give me one good reason
not to call the cops.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.853
- Okay, look I know that
this looks really bad

28:00.896 --> 28:03.420
but I promise you I am not a
weirdo.

28:03.464 --> 28:07.598
Okay, can I just show you
something, just one thing?

28:07.642 --> 28:08.469
Okay.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.824
Now if you still wanna
go to cops I understand

28:15.868 --> 28:17.304
and I won't stop you

28:17.347 --> 28:21.874
but if you do maybe you
wanna show them this.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.747
Okay, I know it's none of my
business

28:25.791 --> 28:27.488
but I think your dad is--

28:27.531 --> 28:29.969
- He's not my real dad.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.405
I was adopted recently.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.754
It's not like he raised me.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.149
Look, I appreciate your concern

28:36.192 --> 28:38.542
but you don't need to worry
about him.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.545
He's old and probably confused.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.678
But he treats me well.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.593
So just delete all of this

28:45.636 --> 28:47.247
and take the cameras down, okay.

28:48.596 --> 28:51.077
- Look you don't have to tell me
anything

28:51.120 --> 28:52.731
you don't want to obviously

28:52.774 --> 28:55.124
but you know maybe if
he is up to something

28:55.168 --> 28:56.560
maybe I can find out, you know,

28:56.604 --> 28:58.084
about him or the house,

28:58.127 --> 28:59.650
if you just give me one more
night,

28:59.694 --> 29:02.218
you know I won't get in between
the two of you I promise.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.832
- You can keep them up for one
more night.

29:06.875 --> 29:07.702
- Awesome.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.659
All right, thank you.

29:12.838 --> 29:13.664
Okay.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.931
- Dude, why you makin'
us do homework right now?

29:20.062 --> 29:21.716
Did someone not tell you that
it's summer?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.065
- Just humor me all right.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.588
The lake will be there tomorrow.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.025
- Look I researched all the
headlines

29:26.068 --> 29:29.376
from 1951 to 52 and nada, okay.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.117
This town has always been
boring.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.075
Yo, you find anything?

29:33.119 --> 29:34.642
- Shit, yeah, dude here.

29:34.685 --> 29:35.512
Check this out.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.602
- [Micheal] Let's see.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.953
- [Colton] Our neighborhood
burnt to a crisp.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.433
Look at that.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.741
- Hold up, only one residence
intact.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.047
One residence.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.136
- [Colton] Yeah, ready
to have your mind blown?

29:51.137 --> 29:51.964
Look at this.

29:54.923 --> 29:55.794
Bam.

29:55.837 --> 29:56.925
- [Micheal] You're kidding me?

29:56.969 --> 29:59.014
- No, dude that's why all of our
houses

29:59.058 --> 30:01.016
are you know like modern and
stuff

30:01.060 --> 30:02.801
except for that one, okay.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.673
How does only one house survive?

30:06.935 --> 30:08.241
- Four isn't enough.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.764
- No, the night vision
on surveillance camera's

30:09.808 --> 30:11.635
only guaranteed to 100 feet

30:11.679 --> 30:13.420
and the zoom's digital.

30:13.463 --> 30:18.468
This has an 85mm lens and shoots
4K.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.515
So better night vision
and image stabilization.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.561
- [Micheal] It is nice man.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.447
What you got?

30:42.797 --> 30:43.711
- Nothing man, you?

30:45.017 --> 30:47.454
- Yeah, swing out to 23 20.

30:47.497 --> 30:48.324
- 23 20.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.024
Oh, no.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.027
- [Micheal] What the hell?

30:55.070 --> 30:58.378
- Oh dude, Mr. Burrows.

30:59.422 --> 31:02.295
- Of course, I guess he still
must be teaching 9th grade.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.518
All right, yeah, that's it for
me.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.607
I'm off to this party so are
you, come on.

31:10.651 --> 31:14.437
- No, no, no, I'm gonna
stay here and find out more.

31:14.481 --> 31:15.525
You have fun though.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.353
- All right, call me if you need
me.

31:17.397 --> 31:18.224
- [Colton] Will do.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.487
- [Micheal] All right, man.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.844
[ominous music]

31:29.888 --> 31:33.761
[speaking in foreign language]

31:37.765 --> 31:41.725
[speaking in foreign language]

32:03.008 --> 32:04.183
- I can't believe it.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.880
- I know right, how's that even
possible?

32:08.448 --> 32:09.797
Are you okay?

32:11.190 --> 32:12.017
Did he do that?

32:13.496 --> 32:16.891
- No, I got kind of lightheaded
last night, fell down.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.200
- I actually recorded.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
Do you have any idea what he's
doing?

32:28.381 --> 32:31.036
Hey, did he ever tell
you why he adopted you?

32:31.079 --> 32:32.863
- I've actually always wondered
too.

32:32.907 --> 32:36.563
I guess he's just old and
didn't have anyone in his life.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.568
- I got you a little something.

32:42.830 --> 32:45.354
On TV they call it a burner.

32:47.791 --> 32:48.705
- Duh.

32:48.749 --> 32:49.576
- Right.

32:50.838 --> 32:53.275
If you ever need to
call me in an emergency

32:53.319 --> 32:56.452
or you know if you ever just
wanna talk to somebody cool.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.285
I'm sorry is that too much?

33:10.031 --> 33:11.511
- My new phone number.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.817
Isn't this how they do it in
movies?

33:13.861 --> 33:16.168
- Yeah, totally, in the old
movies

33:16.211 --> 33:18.170
before cellphones were invented.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.172
[laughing]

33:20.215 --> 33:22.348
Heather, I never asked you your
last name.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.527
- Oh, I guess now it's Torvald.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.921
- Torvald, that would not
have been my first guess.

33:30.965 --> 33:33.185
- Yeah, I'm still getting used
to it.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.057
- So that your new dad's name.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.319
- Yeah.

33:37.363 --> 33:38.755
He's name is Magnus Torvald.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.409
- So he's a viking.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.976
[laughing]

33:42.020 --> 33:42.977
- I guess.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.676
Call me later.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.590
- Yeah, sure.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.028
Bye.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.428
[dramatic music]

34:05.913 --> 34:06.870
Wanna help?

35:59.287 --> 36:01.985
[ominous music]

36:09.297 --> 36:11.865
[camera snaps]

36:13.606 --> 36:16.174
[camera snaps]

36:17.523 --> 36:22.528
Hey there, I'm Colton
from across the street.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.358
Wonder if Heather was home
or if she could come out?

36:26.401 --> 36:27.707
I'm a friend of hers.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.536
- No.

36:30.579 --> 36:34.279
- Oh, okay, if you could
just tell her I said hey,

36:34.322 --> 36:35.367
really appreciate it.

36:36.411 --> 36:37.238
Oh.

36:48.075 --> 36:48.902
All right.

36:53.341 --> 36:56.344
See what you've been shopping
for.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.144
[ominous music]

37:26.722 --> 37:30.378
- You're in luck, our
policy is to destroy records

37:30.422 --> 37:34.600
after 20 years but only
if the case is closed.

37:34.643 --> 37:38.125
- Oh, so was this case never
solved?

37:38.168 --> 37:40.388
- Well, I'd never heard
of it until you called

37:40.432 --> 37:43.739
but when I read the file
it reminded me of something

37:43.783 --> 37:47.047
we'd a, we used to get
calls about way back,

37:47.090 --> 37:48.701
I mean when I first joined.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.051
- Really, like what,

37:51.094 --> 37:52.748
if you don't mind me asking?

37:52.792 --> 37:57.797
- Well, have you ever heard
of satanic ritual abuse?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.149
- No.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.412
- It was all the TV in the 80s,

38:04.456 --> 38:05.805
hundreds of cases reported.

38:05.848 --> 38:08.721
You know televangelist
claiming heavy metal music

38:08.764 --> 38:11.463
was making people turn to devil
worship.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.552
Law enforcement never
found any evidence of it.

38:13.595 --> 38:14.857
It was total hysteria

38:14.901 --> 38:17.686
but you know stories like that

38:17.730 --> 38:19.253
they make for some great copy.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.647
- That's, that's crazy man.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.955
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

38:25.999 --> 38:26.869
- Yeah.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.437
- Yeah, all right, thank you.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.308
- [Officer Huang] Take care.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.835
[dramatic music]

39:12.654 --> 39:14.830
- Yeah, these old directories
have the address and the name.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.528
It's the same guy.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.054
It's like he's been here for 70
years

39:22.795 --> 39:23.883
either that, you know either
that

39:23.926 --> 39:25.972
or he's like owned the place.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.496
- [Micheal] Are you
sure it's the same dude

39:28.540 --> 39:30.672
or it's just the same name?

39:30.716 --> 39:33.849
- Honestly man I have
no idea but it's weird.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.853
I'll call you back.

40:00.441 --> 40:01.529
[phone ringing]

40:01.573 --> 40:03.009
Come on, Heather.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.930
[coughing]

40:14.803 --> 40:17.458
[phone ringing]

40:20.026 --> 40:22.289
[coughing]

40:34.780 --> 40:37.435
[phone ringing]

40:39.654 --> 40:41.917
[coughing]

41:03.504 --> 41:04.331
Dammit.

41:14.602 --> 41:19.302
And then Eugene the unicorn
and his newfound friends

41:19.346 --> 41:23.089
enjoyed troughs, and troughs,
and troughs

41:23.132 --> 41:25.874
full of sticky molasses oats.

41:59.342 --> 42:02.345
[suspenseful music]

42:35.074 --> 42:36.597
- [Micheal] So this guy.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.730
- [Colton] Magnus Torvald.

42:38.773 --> 42:43.299
- Okay, who might be like a
hundred years old, he's old,

42:44.605 --> 42:48.870
sacrificed that Polly
Feagan girl to the Devil.

42:48.914 --> 42:50.219
- Yeah.
- And you think

42:50.263 --> 42:52.439
he's going to do the
same thing to Heather.

42:56.095 --> 42:57.531
- Yeah.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.925
- Okay, well, I'm gonna go
call a paddy wagon for you

42:59.968 --> 43:02.014
'cause this--
- Look I don't,

43:02.057 --> 43:04.059
I can't prove the satanic stuff,

43:04.103 --> 43:05.583
okay, I don't know if that's
real

43:05.626 --> 43:07.846
but there's definitely been
some weird shit going on.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.718
Okay, what about all the
missing cat posters around town?

43:10.762 --> 43:11.893
- [Micheal] Cats.

43:11.937 --> 43:13.939
- Satanic ritual abuse.

43:13.982 --> 43:16.463
I'm serious man, look
it up they take cats.

43:16.506 --> 43:19.292
- So let's say, no, actually
let's not say you're right,

43:19.335 --> 43:21.033
not even hypothetically,

43:21.076 --> 43:22.948
why won't she just tell the
cops what's going on man?

43:22.991 --> 43:25.167
- Because she's too afraid of
him.

43:25.211 --> 43:26.691
- [Micheal] Then Child
Protective Services.

43:26.734 --> 43:28.170
- You can't just call Child
Protective Services, okay.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.868
I don't have enough stuff.

43:29.911 --> 43:34.089
Okay, the videos that I have
aren't proof of anything

43:34.133 --> 43:37.919
other than I'm a pervert,
peeping Tom or something.

43:37.963 --> 43:39.878
- Then get enough.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.840
[ominous music]

44:02.161 --> 44:03.684
- [Heather] I can leave
the backdoor unlocked

44:03.728 --> 44:05.991
but I can't turn a light
on without him seeing it

44:06.034 --> 44:07.645
and it's so dark in here at
night.

44:07.688 --> 44:12.650
- [Colton] Don't worry, I got a
light.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.347
And where's your room?

44:58.391 --> 45:00.175
- [Heather] Upstairs but his
bedroom

45:00.219 --> 45:01.568
is right next to the landing

45:01.611 --> 45:04.658
and the floors are so
creaky, I don't know.

45:05.659 --> 45:09.315
- [Colton] It's cool,
I've got ninja skills.

45:10.229 --> 45:13.232
[voices chattering]

45:14.624 --> 45:17.627
[voices chattering]

45:44.263 --> 45:47.266
[voices chattering]

46:05.850 --> 46:08.809
[voices chattering]

46:52.853 --> 46:55.334
[scary music]

46:56.857 --> 46:58.685
- The last door on the other
left.

47:04.604 --> 47:07.215
I know but it's bigger than the
room

47:07.259 --> 47:09.000
I had growing up, I swear.

47:09.957 --> 47:12.438
- No judgment.

47:17.573 --> 47:18.879
- What?

47:18.923 --> 47:19.924
Do I look okay?

47:19.967 --> 47:20.925
- Yeah, of course.

47:20.968 --> 47:22.970
No, yeah, you look beautiful.

47:24.232 --> 47:25.494
How do you feel?

47:28.062 --> 47:28.889
- I'm exhausted

47:30.543 --> 47:32.371
but I can never sleep.

47:32.414 --> 47:33.720
I have these nightmares.

47:36.201 --> 47:38.507
Colton, what's happening to me?

47:38.551 --> 47:39.595
- I don't know

47:39.639 --> 47:41.293
but I'm gonna get ya out of
here.

47:41.336 --> 47:43.251
An you're gonna get better.

47:43.295 --> 47:45.906
I'm gonna treat you right,
the way you deserve.

48:05.970 --> 48:08.407
[door knocking]

48:08.450 --> 48:11.105
[door pounding]

48:11.149 --> 48:12.063
- [Magnus] Can I come in?

48:12.106 --> 48:12.933
- [Heather] I'm going to sleep.

48:12.977 --> 48:13.847
What do you want?

48:13.891 --> 48:15.109
- [Magnus] I need to come in.

48:15.153 --> 48:15.936
- No, you don't.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.850
Go away.

48:18.112 --> 48:19.331
- This is my house

48:19.374 --> 48:21.028
and for every moment you spend
in my house

48:21.072 --> 48:22.769
you gotta obey the rules.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.293
Why'd you lock this door?

48:26.120 --> 48:28.818
[door crashing]

48:31.865 --> 48:33.258
What are you hiding in here?

48:34.476 --> 48:35.738
- Nothing.

48:35.782 --> 48:38.089
Now get out my room you
miserable old bastard.

48:38.959 --> 48:41.309
- [Magnus] Nothing.

48:41.353 --> 48:42.180
Nothing.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.188
What's this?

48:50.231 --> 48:52.059
- Fine, you found it.

48:52.103 --> 48:53.452
Now get out of my room!

48:56.281 --> 48:58.022
- [Magnus] Someone gave this to
you.

48:59.153 --> 49:01.677
[scary music]

49:05.986 --> 49:08.293
[screaming]

49:11.470 --> 49:14.386
[glass shattering]

49:40.064 --> 49:43.067
[suspenseful music]

49:46.287 --> 49:47.158
- What are you doing?

49:47.201 --> 49:48.028
We gotta get out of here now.

49:48.072 --> 49:49.334
- No, that won't be enough.

49:49.377 --> 49:51.162
He'll get me back again
you have to get more.

50:01.215 --> 50:04.001
- Got you now you son of a
bitch.

50:08.701 --> 50:10.833
- [Operator] Officers should
be arriving any minute.

50:10.877 --> 50:12.270
Just to confirm you are
available

50:12.313 --> 50:14.620
in case the officers
have questions for you

50:14.663 --> 50:15.664
'cause you can remain anonymous.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.014
- No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah,

50:17.057 --> 50:18.450
I'm available, yeah.

50:18.493 --> 50:20.017
- [Operator] Okay, we'll
send someone out right now.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.193
- Great, great, thank you.

50:23.020 --> 50:23.846
Oh yeah.

50:27.415 --> 50:28.242
Yes.

50:30.201 --> 50:32.203
You're going down buddy.

50:36.859 --> 50:38.687
Got you on camera too.

50:41.734 --> 50:44.389
Come on, come on, where are you?

51:10.328 --> 51:11.242
No, no, no.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.687
What about invasion of
privacy that's a crime, right?

51:21.730 --> 51:23.993
- And what specifically
are you referring to?

51:24.037 --> 51:25.952
Something you saw that you're
prepared

51:25.995 --> 51:27.736
to testified about under oath.

51:28.781 --> 51:31.262
- I need to show you
something, all right, okay.

51:33.568 --> 51:36.615
This is hooked up to my
home surveillance system

51:36.658 --> 51:40.314
and just if just you push right
there.

51:47.930 --> 51:48.801
- [Officer Johnson] You're
saying you

51:48.844 --> 51:52.109
just gathered this incidentally.

51:52.152 --> 51:52.979
- Yeah.

51:55.590 --> 51:57.766
- I notice that all four cameras

51:57.810 --> 51:59.855
are pointed in the same
direction.

51:59.899 --> 52:01.118
Typically these are used to
cover

52:01.161 --> 52:03.598
as much of your own property as
possible.

52:03.642 --> 52:05.731
- Of course, right, yeah, no,
that's,

52:05.774 --> 52:07.733
that's all that I have
installed at the moment.

52:07.776 --> 52:09.735
I'm waiting on a check

52:09.778 --> 52:12.825
so I can get some more
cameras in the back.

52:12.868 --> 52:14.131
- [Officer Johnson] These yours?

52:15.654 --> 52:16.959
- Binoculars?

52:17.003 --> 52:19.179
Those are my dad's.

52:19.223 --> 52:21.138
He's a bird watcher.

52:22.617 --> 52:24.793
- You said, "Your father's gone.

52:24.837 --> 52:26.273
Looks like you're using 'em.

52:26.317 --> 52:29.842
- Right, yeah, no, I do a
little birding myself too.

52:31.017 --> 52:34.063
I don't know if you saw the
pictures in the living room.

52:38.024 --> 52:42.376
- Look son, I was young
once full of crazy ideas.

52:43.290 --> 52:45.031
Now what I told you at the
station

52:45.901 --> 52:47.033
that was just hysteria

52:48.513 --> 52:50.863
but a lot of innocent people's
lives got ruined by it.

52:52.256 --> 52:53.300
What you showed me right here

52:53.344 --> 52:54.432
could easily be construed

52:54.475 --> 52:59.001
as invasion of privacy,
harassment.

52:59.045 --> 53:00.264
Now I talked him out

53:00.307 --> 53:01.917
of filing a restraining order
against you.

53:04.442 --> 53:06.922
- The guy's abusing her,
okay, I swear to you.

53:06.966 --> 53:09.229
I just, I might not have the
footage--

53:09.273 --> 53:12.101
- Consider this officially on
notice.

53:12.145 --> 53:13.538
Your neighbor's lives are their
own,

53:13.581 --> 53:15.975
next time there won't be
a warning, understood.

53:16.889 --> 53:17.716
- Yes.

53:18.891 --> 53:19.761
- [Officer Huang] Okay.

53:25.419 --> 53:28.117
[ominous music]

53:38.867 --> 53:41.522
[phone ringing]

53:46.310 --> 53:49.748
- Hey, hey, how'd you get the
phone back?

53:51.576 --> 53:52.751
Heather.

53:52.794 --> 53:53.926
- [Magnus] Don't hang up.

53:55.754 --> 53:58.974
Listen to me she sick,
understand?

53:59.888 --> 54:01.455
She's not coming out anymore.

54:02.413 --> 54:04.284
Not until she gets well.

54:04.328 --> 54:06.460
I will be by her side every
minute

54:07.505 --> 54:08.897
praying for her recovery.

54:09.768 --> 54:12.901
Until then leave her alone.

54:20.953 --> 54:22.737
- You think it'll work?

54:22.781 --> 54:24.913
- What him praying over her,
serious?

54:26.611 --> 54:27.916
- Power of belief.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.657
Whatever, look my mom believes

54:29.701 --> 54:31.790
in all that laying on of hands
type stuff.

54:33.008 --> 54:35.184
- I just wish I knew what caused
it.

54:35.228 --> 54:37.622
She's not contagious
otherwise I would have it.

54:40.146 --> 54:40.973
- No, you didn't.

54:41.016 --> 54:41.800
- [Colton] What?

54:41.843 --> 54:42.670
- [Micheal] You did.

54:43.715 --> 54:45.412
- Little bit, we kissed.

54:45.456 --> 54:46.326
- My man.

54:46.370 --> 54:48.110
- Look she's in danger, okay.

54:48.154 --> 54:50.765
Just we need to put this
guy away, all right.

54:50.809 --> 54:52.289
No one's gonna do this but us.

55:55.047 --> 55:57.702
[ominous music]

56:26.600 --> 56:28.863
[scary music]

56:28.907 --> 56:29.821
No, no, no.

56:32.824 --> 56:33.651
Oh shit!

56:34.652 --> 56:35.479
Shit!

56:36.915 --> 56:37.829
No, no, no.

57:16.302 --> 57:18.783
[scary music]

57:25.616 --> 57:28.314
[phone ringing]

57:29.446 --> 57:31.970
Hey dude, got a big favor to
ask.

57:34.581 --> 57:37.236
[door knocking]

57:39.673 --> 57:40.587
Hey.
- Yo, you didn't bring

57:40.631 --> 57:41.501
that past my mom did you?

57:41.545 --> 57:42.502
- Thank you so much again man,

57:42.546 --> 57:43.851
it'll just be a couple weeks.

57:43.895 --> 57:46.375
- Weeks, forget it man, nah.

57:46.419 --> 57:47.594
Take this back man, I'm not
doing it.

57:47.638 --> 57:48.987
- Dude, I wouldn't have asked
you

57:49.030 --> 57:51.555
if I didn't think this
was the only way, come on.

57:51.598 --> 57:53.208
- Yo, this cabin fever thing you
got going

57:53.252 --> 57:55.123
is really taking you over the
edge.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.691
Now look, I met some cool
cats at the lake last time,

57:57.735 --> 58:00.041
call 'em up, maybe go hang out,
chill,

58:00.085 --> 58:02.043
let's do something--
- Look man, she's gonna die

58:02.087 --> 58:05.090
if I don't save her, all right,
period.

58:05.133 --> 58:06.613
And he might get away with it.

58:08.789 --> 58:10.617
- All right, fine.

58:10.661 --> 58:13.707
But if you catch this guy,
hey, we both go on CNN.

58:13.751 --> 58:15.100
- Of course.

58:15.143 --> 58:17.624
- Okay, and if you see
my cat through that thing

58:17.668 --> 58:18.669
you holler at me, huh.

58:18.712 --> 58:19.974
- Yeah, all right.

58:28.156 --> 58:29.244
- Here kitty, kitty.

58:35.860 --> 58:37.035
Fluffy Ruffles.

58:37.949 --> 58:39.167
Come here, Fluffy.

58:45.609 --> 58:46.523
Fluffy.

58:51.963 --> 58:52.790
Come here.

58:58.404 --> 58:59.274
Fluffy.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.147
Fluffy.

59:07.456 --> 59:09.067
[cat meowing]

59:09.110 --> 59:10.764
Is that you, Fluffy?

59:10.808 --> 59:13.332
[cat meowing]

59:14.725 --> 59:17.379
[lips smacking]

59:50.587 --> 59:53.067
[scary music]

59:54.112 --> 59:54.939
- What?

59:56.984 --> 59:58.899
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.337
- [Micheal] You know the drill.

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:03.730
- Hey man, can you check the
connection

01:00:03.774 --> 01:00:05.863
on your camera the
feed's getting all weird?

01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.081
And call me back, all right.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:07.952
Bye.

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:20.268
[ominous music]

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:23.271
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:27.275
[speaking in foreign language]

01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:46.468
[screaming]

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:17.848
Come on, Mike.

01:01:19.023 --> 01:01:20.415
Shit.

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:21.852
- All right, I'll see ya at the
pool.

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.944
- It's funny, huh?

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:28.989
- Yeah.
- You're gonna leave me.

01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:29.860
- [Sonja] Bye.

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:34.516
[phone ringing]

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.387
- Dammit.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:38.564
Yo, what's up?

01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:40.218
- Tonight's the night dude.

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:41.088
I'm going in.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.397
- Colton, oh no, no, no, no.

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:48.792
Why now?

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.359
- [Colton] Because he's up to
something.

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:54.362
I don't think we have
much time left, all right.

01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:56.147
How did Heather look on your
camera?

01:01:58.279 --> 01:02:00.673
- I was kinda indisposed

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.067
but her curtain's closed now
though.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.633
Did you wanna jail break her
out?

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:06.723
- [Colton] No, I need a
drill to unscrew those locks,

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.899
the son of a bitch did a good
job.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.639
Just please pay attention
when I go in there,

01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:12.816
okay, text is best.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.254
- What you gonna do, kill him?

01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:18.952
- Don't be insane.

01:02:18.996 --> 01:02:22.303
He has to be doing some
seriously
disturbing shit up there.

01:02:22.347 --> 01:02:26.438
Find out what so maybe they'll
give us [faintly speaking].

01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:27.918
[laughing]

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:30.398
- I can't believe I'm be
an accomplice to this shit.

01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:32.749
- [Colton] Just keep an eye
on that asshole, all right.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:36.230
Make sure you don't become
an accessory to a homicide.

01:02:36.274 --> 01:02:37.623
Okay, bye, Mike.

01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:12.484
- Oh shit.

01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:37.074
Yeah, that's it.

01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:45.647
[glass shattering]

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.918
This is cake, buddy.

01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.732
Hurry man, don't waste time!

01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:15.014
Oh shit, oh shit.

01:06:15.058 --> 01:06:18.844
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:56.099
[suspenseful music]

01:07:09.547 --> 01:07:10.461
Shit, shit.

01:08:13.872 --> 01:08:16.527
Oh God, oh shit, oh God, oh God.

01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:23.316
[phone ringing]

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:26.450
Come on.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:27.451
Dammit man!

01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:30.584
[scary music]

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:31.455
Shit.

01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:44.381
Get out man, get out, get out!

01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:46.356
Oh shit, move, move man, move!

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:48.923
[scary music]

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:50.985
Yes, go baby, go!

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:03.781
- Shit.

01:11:05.522 --> 01:11:07.785
[groaning]

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:14.400
Damn, what happened man?

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:15.488
You almost got me killed.

01:11:15.532 --> 01:11:17.142
- Yo, I texted, I called, I
texted,

01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:19.797
almost called the cops.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.321
- Then what the hell happened?

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:24.410
[phone beeping]

01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:25.455
Oh shit.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:26.543
- Told you man.

01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:27.370
Now what'd you see in there?

01:11:27.413 --> 01:11:28.414
Did you get any proof?

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.285
- Dude, no.

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:30.677
I was right man,

01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:32.070
this guy's up to something
very, very bad, okay.

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.290
- So do we call the cops now?

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.203
- No, forget it.

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.117
I'm going back over there dude,

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:37.031
I gotta get her out of there.

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:38.337
And I totally understand man,

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:40.296
you don't have to help
me anymore I get it.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.471
- Shut up, man.

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:42.950
Just tell me when.

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:45.649
- All right, all right, I'll
call you.

01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:50.480
[ominous music]

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.877
No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:41.792

01:12:42.836 --> 01:12:44.360
I'm gonna call the cops!

01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:47.928
You touch a hair on
her head I'll kill you!

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:17.393
Oh shit!

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:18.263
Rachel!

01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:35.715
Rachel!

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:36.586
Help!

01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:42.940

01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:54.430
[door pounding]

01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:01.393
No!

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:14.841
- Will he be okay?

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.946
- Sure you wanna do this man?

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:35.383
- You didn't see the ax he as
carrying.

01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:36.733
You need backup.

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:39.910
- Love you bro.

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:57.884
[glass shattering]

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:39.447
- Oh, what the.

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:05.256
- Hey Heather, can you hear me?

01:16:06.866 --> 01:16:08.389
It's me Colton.

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.303
I'm gonna get you out of there
okay,

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:11.741

Oh, oh, you sick piece of.

Where are you?

01:16:37.114 --> 01:16:38.768
Bastard, where you at?

01:16:39.943 --> 01:16:40.857
Oh shit.

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:53.783
- Hey.

01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:08.580
Heather, wake up.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.278
I got ya, I got ya, I got ya.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.628
I'm gonna get you out of here,
okay.

01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:13.933
- He's in here.

01:17:13.977 --> 01:17:15.369
He'll kill you.

01:17:15.413 --> 01:17:17.720
- No, I'm gonna get you out of
this, okay.

01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:19.286
You understand me?

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:24.596
- You're crazy.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.773
- Only fools rush in.

01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:39.002
Come on, let's go.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:31.707
[scary music]

01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:47.810
Rachel.

01:18:49.768 --> 01:18:51.204
Hey, Rachel!

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:52.031
Rachel.

01:18:52.075 --> 01:18:53.554
Hey!

01:18:53.598 --> 01:18:54.599
- He told me to make sure
you didn't get into trouble.

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:55.513
- Who told you that, who did?

01:18:55.556 --> 01:18:56.644
- He said."You're a good person

01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:58.777
"but you're doing a bad thing."

01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:02.215
- [Colton] Rachel, get over
here.

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:03.086
Hey!

01:19:16.534 --> 01:19:18.754
- Traced the call to this
address.

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:19.580
Couldn't hear anything he was
saying

01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:20.930
but clearly distressed.

01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:27.719
Drop the weapon!

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.635
Drop the weapon, drop the
weapon!

01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:32.898
[groaning]

01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:37.120
Colton, Colton, can you hear me?

01:19:54.137 --> 01:19:56.748
[gentle music]

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:01.971
You all right, Rachel?

01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:04.538
- Rach.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.630
- She might be in shock.

01:20:09.674 --> 01:20:11.197
The EMT said, "She'll be okay."

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.852
They took Micheal to the
hospital

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.898
but he'll be just fine.

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.554
- I gotta do one more thing,
okay.

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.469
And then we'll go home, all
right.

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:36.048
So it's true all of it.

01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:40.487
About the great fire,
murdered that Feagan girl.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:43.316
- You don't understand
boy, there's no time.

01:20:44.361 --> 01:20:46.842
- You don't gotta worry
about time anymore,

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:48.539
got all the time in the world
now.

01:20:50.758 --> 01:20:51.716
- No, you don't.

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:00.638
- [EMT] She's coming around.

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:06.383
- Yes, I was there.

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:09.516
The parents of the Feagan girl

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.040
they brought her up to me

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.694
when they realized that this
child was not meant to be.

01:21:15.044 --> 01:21:16.872
I mean she looked like a human
child

01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:21.615
but she was demon conceived in
the sight

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:22.747
of the Prince of Evil.

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.707
So I performed the rites

01:21:26.751 --> 01:21:31.756
and after 13 days I
summoned the shades of abyss

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:37.588
to come up and to take
her back once she came,

01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:42.201
back to hell.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.248
Your sister learned the truth.

01:21:48.164 --> 01:21:49.905
I tried to help her.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:52.603
[ominous music]

01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:12.405
Shh.

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:16.453
Her parents discovered the
truth and so did the orphanage.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.849
They gave her to me to banish
her back to the lake of fire

01:22:21.893 --> 01:22:23.155
before she grew strong.

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:26.332
- [EMT] How's that?

01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:29.770
- I'm hungry.

01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:31.947
- Oh, yeah, anything I can get
you miss?

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:37.517
- How about a nice fat fucking
house cat?

01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:43.045
- I told them how to contain her
evil

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:45.134
until I could bring her under my
control.

01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:14.902
I preformed the rites, I
weakened her.

01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:17.862
- You're an exorcist.

01:23:17.905 --> 01:23:18.994
- I summon the shades

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:21.344
to come forth on 13th day of the
ritual.

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:26.044
Now they're coming any moment

01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:29.178
and if she is not inside that
house

01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:30.962
they won't take her.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.920
Now for the love of Almighty God

01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:37.577
you are the only one that
could do something now.

01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:40.885
You're the only one.

01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:45.672
- [Officer Huang] We still
have a lot to discuss,

01:23:45.716 --> 01:23:46.543
I'll call you.

01:23:47.979 --> 01:23:48.806
You did good kid.

01:24:02.776 --> 01:24:05.431
[siren wailing]

01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:09.870
[ominous music]

01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:14.832
- Rachel!

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:18.314
Rachel!

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:21.969
Heather!

01:24:25.538 --> 01:24:26.365
Rachel!

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:39.770
[fire roaring]

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:52.087
[house creaking]

01:25:11.584 --> 01:25:12.411
Heather.

01:25:17.329 --> 01:25:19.331
- [Rachel] Colton, help!

01:25:20.202 --> 01:25:21.246
- [Colton] No!

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:22.117
Rachel!

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:50.667
[lightning crackling]

01:26:04.202 --> 01:26:06.944
[dragon roaring]

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.915
[ominous music]
