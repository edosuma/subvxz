00:01.880 --> 00:03.609
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:05.920 --> 00:08.161
Whatever we're doing here,

00:08.240 --> 00:09.605
please tell me it's worth it.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.925
<i>I have cousins in Europe.</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:14.801
I can't do anything
about what's happening over there,

00:14.880 --> 00:16.450
but you can.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.128
The man inside Heisenberg's project...

00:19.200 --> 00:21.680
They executed him.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.807
Magpie?

00:22.880 --> 00:26.362
You didn't tell anyone
else about him, did you?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.205
Frank's been sending money?

00:28.360 --> 00:30.328
Tell him he has nothing to feel guilty about.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.926
Why would Frank feel guilty?

00:33.240 --> 00:35.288
It's true.
You've been listening to Akley.

00:35.360 --> 00:40.161
I am not gonna be the last casualty
of Frank Winter's ego.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.810
I'm going home, Charlie.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.521
- The Army won't allow it.
- They will if we're divorced.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.881
Thin Man is dead.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.444
This project won't survive without us.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.646
You'd work with me?

01:02.720 --> 01:04.245
<i>You did the best you could, Reed.</i>

01:05.600 --> 01:07.125
Reed!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.440 --> 01:20.046
They told us one day.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.566
That was five days ago.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.846
See that red stamp?

01:24.520 --> 01:26.682
That means there are contingencies.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.684
Some men from the government
have taken an interest in your case.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.728
What men? I don't understand.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.724
I'm afraid it's out of my hands.
You'll just have to wait.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.690
I filled out the forms.
I paid the entry fee.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.322
You tell me we need to pay
$50 to enter the country.

01:15.400 --> 02:25.400
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:58.520 --> 02:59.806
Ma'am.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.684
I understand that these nice people
have an American sponsor.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.649
Yes, this is the one.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.200
She says his name is Charles Isaacs.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.649
He is a very important man.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.922
Tell me about Mr. Isaacs.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.926
I guess it's always a mystery.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.721
Suicide. But Reed Akley?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.043
How did he seem when you saw him last?

03:54.120 --> 03:56.088
I don't know.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.889
The same.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.962
I guess I never realized.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.287
Hard as it is having secrets kept from you...

04:06.120 --> 04:08.407
...keeping them must be harder.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.085
Callie!

04:43.600 --> 04:45.682
Is anyone planning on getting that?

04:46.680 --> 04:49.001
All right, already. Hold your fire.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.167
Um...

04:54.520 --> 04:55.760
Dad?

05:01.480 --> 05:02.686
Dad!

05:05.000 --> 05:07.287
How's his wife holding up?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.124
Does it matter?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.362
At least he didn't have children.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.162
Success has many fathers,
failure is an orphan.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.446
Reed Akley was the father of the most
expensive failure in the history of war.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.090
I was his father.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.010
There's a...
There's a problem with Thin Man?

05:31.120 --> 05:32.724
Reed Akley is dead.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.007
So is Thin Man, as you well know.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.971
That doesn't mean the project is dead.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.285
- The implosion bomb works.
- Babbit told me.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.931
- I'll need a written briefing by day's end.
- I can do that.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.202
It's for the War Department.
Use small words.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.648
We have to reassure them
there's continuity of leadership.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.801
I need to know that you're ready.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.769
Ready? Ready for...

05:55.840 --> 05:58.810
Twenty-four hours, you'll be sitting
in a room with the Secretary of War.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.684
If I could choose anyone else, I would,

06:00.760 --> 06:03.570
but you're the only man who knows
implosion well enough to run the program.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.483
Whatever messes you've made,
clean them up.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.281
Can't have you tracking mud
onto the carpet of the Oval Office.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.842
- I'll need Glen back as my number two.
- Dr. Babbit will be retiring from the project.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.684
- Robert...
- He abused the power of my office.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.491
Betrayed my trust. That was his choice.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.609
Friends of Frank Winter don't have
a long shelf life on this hill, do they?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.850
It's not the way I wanted it.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.567
That makes two of us.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.609
And, Frank, buy a comb.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.403
Nice of you to drop in.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.926
Should I wake your son or are you
just here to change your clothes?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.331
Abby, please.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.971
You can’t just hibernate in your office

07:18.080 --> 07:21.163
or wherever you've spent
the last two nights.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.767
- Akley's gone.
- Where?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.889
He

07:27.320 --> 07:29.163
put a gun in his mouth and...

07:34.280 --> 07:35.281
Uh...

07:36.600 --> 07:37.965
Reed Akley? My God.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.330
It's my fault, Abby.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.046
- What?
- I let him paint himself into a corner.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.521
I should have walked into his office
two months ago.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.570
Ma'am, we're gonna
have to borrow your husband.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.090
Charlie. Excuse me. No.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.611
Charlie. Charlie!

07:55.680 --> 07:58.206
- It's gonna be fine, Abby.
- I need to speak to my husband, sir.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.124
It's just a misunderstanding, Abby.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.281
Joey!

08:01.360 --> 08:02.850
You stay out of there.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.530
Do not go in there!

08:19.200 --> 08:20.690
I'll have to get a new suit.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.489
We're really taking over?

08:22.560 --> 08:26.281
Helen, you will run
the model and design group.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.607
Meeks, the electric division.
Fritz, metallurgy.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.889
I have a jacket, but I lost the pants
and it doesn't match my other trousers.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.808
The end of the war

08:34.880 --> 08:37.690
could be decided
by the five people in this group.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.083
I know what my decision is.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.804
Helen, where the hell is Crosley?

08:53.400 --> 08:54.765
I don't know.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.410
What about Charlie Isaacs?

09:01.760 --> 09:05.924
There have been violations
of compartmentalization over at Thin Man.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.844
The Army is wiping
its leadership slate clean.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.571
Dr. Isaacs.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.286
Have a seat.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.966
I've been sitting for the last eight months.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.522
Quite a rookie season you've had.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.887
Two months ago you were a towel boy.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.440
Now you're Reed Akley's secret weapon.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.409
Well, you and the rifle.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.010
I'm sorry to hear the news.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.567
So was I.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.530
- Why did he do it?
- I have no clue.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.840
Don't you?

09:56.920 --> 09:59.764
I understand there was
a technical problem with Thin Man.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.162
What kind of problem?

10:05.240 --> 10:07.288
The kind that loses a war.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.161
Akley knew?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.766
We're auditing Thin Man's files to find out.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.649
There are some irregularities.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.006
- In Akley's files?
- In yours, actually.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.807
The calculations
you've been assigning your staff,

10:26.880 --> 10:30.851
it's almost as if they have
no bearing on Thin Man whatsoever.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.204
They may look irregular to an untrained eye.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.211
But your former colleague, Dr. Lancefield,
he's trained, isn't he?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.965
- Tom Lancefield?
- He told me a fascinating story.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.487
Said you'd hotwired the project
and were driving it over a cliff.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.040
They found stolen files
under his floorboards.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.726
He's probably fingered
Dwight Eisenhower by now.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.121
The timing is curious, though, isn't it?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.282
Reed Akley knights you.

10:56.360 --> 11:00.684
Two months later, he's lying
on an autopsy table and so is his bomb,

11:00.760 --> 11:02.808
and no one can make heads or tails

11:02.880 --> 11:05.804
out of the paper trail
coming out of your office.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.521
I was exploring alternate theories
out of an excess of caution.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.242
Funny how to an untrained eye
caution looks like sabotage.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.401
I was trying to save the project.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.165
So you were aware
of a problem in Thin Man.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.451
Let's talk about <i>Herr</i> Doctor Schlimmer.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.128
Magpie, our man
inside Werner Heisenberg's lab.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.771
Till somebody talked and he lost his head.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.688
I'm sorry, what agency do you represent?

11:48.240 --> 11:51.767
Justice, Treasury, War, Immigration.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.284
When did you become aware
of the existence

11:55.400 --> 11:57.641
of an allied spy in the Nazi's bomb project?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.646
Hello?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.805
Rose?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.121
Rose?

12:33.560 --> 12:34.800
Liza.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.570
I thought you were the driver.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.011
I couldn't spend another night here alone.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.007
I'm taking Reed back to Chicago.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.804
Rose, I'm so sorry.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.361
Is there anything I can do?

13:00.440 --> 13:03.125
You won. The town council.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.002
It was a landslide.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.924
None of that really matters.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.727
They're wrong, you know?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.450
Reed didn't...

13:51.400 --> 13:53.971
Must have been an accident.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.362
He had the world on a string.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.689
He was almost ready to deliver the peace.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.883
Liza...

14:10.880 --> 14:13.486
Did Frank say anything to you

14:15.880 --> 14:17.245
about Reed?

14:21.240 --> 14:23.527
He said that Reed was the most

14:25.400 --> 14:27.528
brilliant man he'd ever met.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.602
Ma'am, the car's out front.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.046
Take care of Frank.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.803
He's on the throne now.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.805
That's what really killed Reed, you know?

15:11.680 --> 15:12.966
The Gadget.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.328
I don't know how many
different ways I can say this.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.042
Even if I had known

15:38.120 --> 15:41.249
about an inside man
in Werner Heisenberg's staff...

15:41.320 --> 15:43.084
- Which you didn't.
- Which I didn't.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.164
I wouldn't have told a soul,
least of all the Nazis.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.084
- I have family in Europe.
- In Minsk.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.051
Not a particularly hospitable
corner of the map for Jews.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.486
The thing about secrets,

15:55.600 --> 15:59.605
once the genie's loose,
you can never put it back in the bottle.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.081
First two people know,
then four, then eight, then 16.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.084
It's a chain reaction.
You tell some Russian apparatchik,

16:05.160 --> 16:08.801
somewhere in Berlin a physicist winds up
in a coffin with extra headroom.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.281
But why would I talk to the Russians?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.203
'Cause family is everything.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.204
And you had family in Minsk.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.921
Yuri, the husband,
he's still there and probably dead.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.369
But Malka and the little girl,

16:25.280 --> 16:26.441
they're in New York City.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.285
And they're very eager to meet you,
their American benefactor.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.846
They made it out?

16:36.920 --> 16:39.287
The Soviets are a funny bunch.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.805
They'll put a bullet through your head

16:40.880 --> 16:43.281
and send your wife the bill
for the ammunition.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.122
And yet they tend to keep their promises
tit for tat.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.329
They got an inside line
to the Manhattan Project, and you,

16:52.400 --> 16:55.529
you got your wife's family out of Europe.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.089
Reed Akley got them out.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.568
I...

17:15.079 --> 17:18.128
I asked him if there was
anything he could do.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.125
Well, let's bring him down here
so he can confirm your story.

17:26.240 --> 17:30.006
I would never disclose military secrets.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.206
Prove it.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.206
No.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.764
No, I can't. I can't prove it.

17:37.840 --> 17:42.846
I can't prove
that I'm not the Tooth Fairy either.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.490
You can't prove a negative.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.490
You scientists do it all the time.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.040
What do you call it? A null hypothesis?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.807
If you can't prove your theory is valid,

17:54.880 --> 17:57.724
you examine the opposite theory
and try to refute it.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.928
Let's look at all the data, you and I.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.721
Charles Isaacs is not a spy.
That's our null hypothesis.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.486
If it were true, we'd expect him
to be loyal to his country.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.766
That's why I'm here.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.686
And yet, since the day you arrived,
you've questioned the ethics of a project

18:12.760 --> 18:15.889
undertaken to protect
your country from annihilation.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.566
- If Charles Isaacs were not a spy...
- Listen to me...

18:18.640 --> 18:21.803
I would expect him to associate
with law-abiding citizens.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.405
Your father is Oscar Isaacs,

18:23.480 --> 18:25.244
former member
of the Socialist Party of America,

18:25.320 --> 18:27.721
current resident
of the Missouri State Penitentiary.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.564
My father and I haven't spoken in years.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.849
You also are acquainted
with a Professor Richard Lavro

18:32.920 --> 18:37.482
who traded his office at Harvard
for one in Stalin's atomic research division,

18:37.560 --> 18:40.848
an association you misrepresented
the last time we met.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.048
If Charles Isaacs is not a spy,

18:43.120 --> 18:46.090
we'd expect him to be
forthcoming and cooperative,

18:46.160 --> 18:49.846
and yet you have lied since the moment
you set foot into this room.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.526
So I'm your unified theory.
Is that right, genius?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.770
That every scientific failure,
every intelligence slip up,

18:55.840 --> 18:58.286
I'm singlehandedly responsible?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.601
I'm not so sure it was singlehanded.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.126
The Perlmans are your wife's cousins?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.850
What role did Abby play in all of this?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.610
Paul.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.842
Didn't think you had
the first idea where I lived.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.287
I didn't. Helen told me.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.160
So you told Akley we were
siphoning resources from Thin Man?

19:27.240 --> 19:28.321
No, I didn't.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.289
He just pieced it together on his own?

19:30.360 --> 19:31.850
We weren't siphoning anything, Frank.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.968
You and Isaacs were. And Helen.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.567
I just gave Akley what you declined
to give me, the benefit of the truth.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.803
It wasn't too much of a benefit, was it?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.963
Don't you dare lay his death at my feet.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.929
It doesn't matter now.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.289
As of today, all the eyes within these fences
will be trained on our group.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.169
You're afraid I'll talk, Frank.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.685
That's what you're even doing here.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.570
To make sure I don't tell
any inconvenient tales in the schoolyard.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.529
We need to stand together.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.360
My father was a blacksmith, Frank.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.090
He spent his whole life hammering iron.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.685
That was supposed to be my life, too.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.445
And then one day,
I read about Lord Rutherford

20:09.560 --> 20:11.528
changing nitrogen into oxygen.

20:11.600 --> 20:16.003
And I thought, "There's a life for me.
I can turn my stock into a nobler metal."

20:16.080 --> 20:18.845
But all those years at Oxford
surrounded by boy kings,

20:18.920 --> 20:20.524
I never belonged.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.045
Of course I didn't.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.689
But in your group, Frank,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.242
with the lads, with Helen...

20:30.280 --> 20:32.886
You belong in the implosion group, Paul.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.360
With us.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.324
No.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.641
I thought I did.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.250
I was mistaken.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.483
You get my silence.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.644
But not me.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.965
Abby.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.245
What the hell are you...
You shouldn't be here.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.163
They said you needed to see me.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.682
They wouldn't even let me clean myself up.
What is going on?

21:21.360 --> 21:23.681
He brought you in here to spook me.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.565
He thinks I'll crack under the pressure.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.886
Who?

21:28.880 --> 21:31.247
Are you in over your head?
Should I call my father, because...

21:31.320 --> 21:34.881
Abby, trust me, this is outside
of the Hat King's jurisdiction.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.724
Yes, well, my father may be
in Massachusetts,

21:36.800 --> 21:39.121
but he's on a first-name basis
with half of Washington, Charlie.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.009
- Senator Weeks was at our wedding.
- You need to go home.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.448
MPs are tearing the place apart.
It's a miracle the walls are still standing.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.841
No. I mean home. Massachusetts.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.369
Is this about the Lancefields?

21:58.680 --> 22:00.523
Your family is safe.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.327
What?

22:04.080 --> 22:06.208
Your cousins in Europe.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.566
The Perlmans.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.644
They're dead, Charlie.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.848
No, no.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.723
They're in New York.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.202
Probably bunked up in some fleabag hotel,

22:25.320 --> 22:26.924
but they're fine.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.529
Safer than we are.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.210
Now, some men from the government
are asking questions.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.521
- They...
- They think that you're a spy.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.968
Well, that I traded military secrets.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.644
But you didn't.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.202
No, I didn't. Of course not.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.161
Whatever they think you did,
Frank Winter made you do it.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.881
- You tell them that.
- Abby, you'd be implicated, too.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.091
Frank knows.

23:07.440 --> 23:11.286
He knows that you helped me make
an unmonitored call to Site X.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.445
He knows that you put the papers
in Lancefields apartment. He knows.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.048
You can have the divorce.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.563
I won't fight it.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.961
You and Joey need to get
as far away from this place...

23:28.040 --> 23:29.883
- Charlie, I...
- ...as you can.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.443
Abby...

23:35.600 --> 23:36.726
Mmm.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.928
I am so sorry.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.128
You know, maybe if we never came here...

23:43.200 --> 23:45.362
Maybe if we stayed in Brookline,
things would be different.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.284
- Hey. Abby. Abby. Come on...
- Charlie. Charlie.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.404
Please don't take him. Please don't hurt him!

23:50.480 --> 23:52.767
- It's gonna be fine.
- No.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.888
Please don't hurt him.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.926
Glen.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.526
Figured you'd be trying to teach
basic calculus

24:09.600 --> 24:11.728
to the group formerly known as Thin Man.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.763
God knows how I'll do that without you.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.285
Oh, you'll manage.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.008
I doubt I'm gonna make it up to the house
before I go.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.491
They want me off the Hill.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.769
But, uh, tell my goddaughter

24:24.840 --> 24:27.810
she'll have the rest of her life
for drinking and smoking cigarettes.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.209
I imagine the lions will be happy
to have their chairman back.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.770
Emeritus.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.888
Of practically everything these days.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.765
Anyway, while we've been
playing in the sandbox,

24:44.840 --> 24:48.447
Columbia has fallen in love
with experimental physics.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.807
Then where? Chicago? Yale?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.291
Moscow?

24:55.240 --> 24:56.810
I don't know.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.884
I hear a lot of old bachelors
are heading west.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.048
You deserve to be happy.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.886
Yeah.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.890
Glen, if there's anything I could do...

25:15.960 --> 25:18.247
Twenty years ago,
I thought I was a pretty good physicist,

25:18.320 --> 25:20.641
then you walked into my office.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.800
Goddamn college sophomore.

25:24.560 --> 25:28.531
I didn't know what was missing
from my work until I saw it in yours.

25:29.560 --> 25:33.167
This project needs you
a lot more than it needs me.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.571
I need you.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.330
Honestly, I'm relieved.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.730
I suppose somebody has to build it,

25:43.800 --> 25:47.088
but I'm glad it's not gonna be
on my tombstone.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.570
- I'll call you as soon as it's over.
- Don't

25:50.680 --> 25:52.444
Glen, I wish there was
something that I could do...

25:52.520 --> 25:55.046
Stop trying to have it both ways, Frank.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.282
It doesn't matter if you're a good man.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.929
Maybe a good man
couldn't have made implosion work.

26:01.880 --> 26:06.090
All that matters is that
you are the man to end this war.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.886
Let God do the accounting when it's over.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.526
Yeah.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.487
Oh...

26:41.200 --> 26:42.201
Huh.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.166
Yesterday, nobody on this hill
even knew who we were.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.720
Anyway, I do support Jeannie's work,

26:48.800 --> 26:52.247
I just don't think it's right for the new head
of the plutonium division to be unmarried.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.288
We're all gonna get tiny, little pay bumps

26:54.360 --> 26:56.488
and I'm sure I'll have enough
for a ring in a month or so.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.881
- Hey, mazel tov.
- Watch out.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.440
The ladies are gonna be beating
a path to your door in no time.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.760
Mr. Meeks?

27:03.720 --> 27:05.802
You mean Division Head Meeks?

27:05.880 --> 27:09.168
This guy's rising faster than rail road stock,
darling.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.130
There was a call at the switchboard.
I'm sorry.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.681
Wow.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.410
This is a step up.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.884
You know, I've learned not to grow
too attached to offices one way or the other.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.165
Well, I'm just looking forward
to having a door.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.641
Wait till people start knocking on it.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.210
My mother died yesterday.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.200
Well, it was after midnight,
so maybe it was today.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.487
The nurses at Bangor General
didn't know which.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.608
Jesus, Jim. I'm sorry.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.125
Was it unexpected?

27:57.400 --> 28:02.042
Well, she made it into her 50s with polio,
so that's something, right?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.241
Well, your new office will be
waiting for you when you get back.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.004
Well, I can't leave now.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.481
Not with everything that's going on.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.485
Anyway, the Army would never
grant me a pass on such short notice.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.403
You'll have one by sunset.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.006
Turns out this office comes
with a few privileges.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.969
Thanks, Frank.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.242
I won't be gone long. I swear.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.921
Is your mother still alive, Frank?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.325
I don't know.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.568
- She told me everything.
- Where's Abby?

28:58.640 --> 29:01.291
Women are always quick
to protect their children.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.840
Husbands tend not to get
the same treatment.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.729
Your wife is sitting in the next room.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.929
She told me
everything you've done and why.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.286
That's bullshit.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.168
No one can blame a man

29:14.240 --> 29:17.005
for trying to save his wife's family
from the Nazis

29:17.080 --> 29:19.128
and his marriage all in one fell swoop.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.645
Abby would not have told you anything.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.886
Betrayal gets easier and easier and easier.

29:25.960 --> 29:30.284
After all, she has been betraying you
for months with your neighbor.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.731
Making love in Lancefields bed.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.484
In your bed.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.923
Well, now I know you're lying.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.287
She hated Lancefield.
She wouldn't go anywhere near him.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.567
Yes, well, of course you're right.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.201
But you see, that foreign wife of his,

29:48.280 --> 29:50.442
she had an interesting story, too.

29:51.560 --> 29:55.849
One about romancing your wife
while you were at work.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.927
Your wife is a complicated woman,
Dr. Isaacs.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.527
But as soon as she realized
that she might very well lose her son,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.840
getting her to admit
what you've done was simple.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.008
I don't believe you.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.565
But you do.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.367
You're thinking back to every bridge game,

30:30.320 --> 30:31.526
every martini.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.564
Every time your wife...

30:35.880 --> 30:38.804
Every time your wife told you
she was going over there

30:38.880 --> 30:41.645
to borrow another cup of flour
from that woman.

30:41.720 --> 30:47.124
So you might as well start admitting
what I already know fact by fact!

30:47.240 --> 30:48.890
We're done here, asshole.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.044
You know, our businesses
are not so different.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.681
A secret trapped inside a man
is just like the energy trapped in an atom.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.841
It wants to be released.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.526
Of course, I don't nearly
have the resources you do.

31:07.600 --> 31:12.447
Myself, I've only had
a few dedicated patriots, but they...

31:12.520 --> 31:17.686
They have developed
some very advanced techniques

31:17.760 --> 31:19.762
to convince a man to talk.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.122
What, you're gonna torture me?

31:29.840 --> 31:32.002
The Geneva Convention of 1929...

31:32.080 --> 31:36.290
Where you're going, people don't
concern themselves with convention.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.209
<i>It is feared that the other
members of the crew have been drowned.</i>

31:55.280 --> 31:59.604
<i>With the view of the established presence
of German submarines in this vicinity,</i>

31:59.720 --> 32:04.806
<i>there can be no reasonable doubt
as to the identity of the flag...</i>

32:24.640 --> 32:27.325
- Hi. You must be Abby.
- Yes.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.326
Is your husband here?

32:29.800 --> 32:32.770
- I'm Helen Prins. I work with him.
- I know who you are.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.161
Did Dr. Isaacs stay home today?

32:35.240 --> 32:38.130
- We've been looking for him in the tech area.
- We?

32:38.200 --> 32:39.690
It's urgent.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.524
Business or pleasure?

32:56.160 --> 32:59.403
I'm sorry, sweetie,
all the doors are locked. I'm coming.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.724
Hello, my life! Come here.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.648
How high did you
get on the swings this time?

33:13.760 --> 33:15.250
- I get...
- So high.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.164
- Could you excuse us just for a minute?
- I get super high.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.891
So high! You run on in there.
I cleaned your room up.

33:20.960 --> 33:24.123
I get super high on the swings.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.131
I think you should leave.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.964
I really need to see him.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.485
Well, you're a little late.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.289
MPs came for Charlie this morning.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.206
Why?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.207
Because they think
that a Jew from East St. Louis

33:41.280 --> 33:43.806
is passing military secrets
to people who want to exterminate us.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.530
And you are not the only person on this hill

33:45.600 --> 33:48.570
who's trying to take
my husband away from his family.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.684
Which book did you pick?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.763
That looks like a good one.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.285
Frank!

34:05.360 --> 34:09.763
You know, Akley derived a new space-time
geometry when he was still in college?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.045
It's Charlie.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.763
You heard me earlier.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.809
There is no place for him here.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.848
They're shipping him off the Hill.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.282
He knew the risks.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.523
He came to me with eyes wide open.
What do you want, Helen?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.206
Do you want all three of us to go down
for breaking compartmentalization?

34:32.280 --> 34:35.362
You don't understand.
They think he's a traitor.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.611
Never thought I'd say it,
but I'm gonna miss this shithole.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.727
You're gonna miss it, too. Just watch.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.648
You'll have an army of Ph.D.'s
at your beck and call,

36:04.720 --> 36:07.564
a desk the size of a Studebaker.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.802
You'll wish you were
back in this closet with six guys

36:09.880 --> 36:12.884
and a theory written on
the back of an envelope.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.042
You don't owe me anything, Frank.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.370
You didn't force me to take those papers.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.569
If you hadn't turned me over,
the project would be dead in the water.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.808
Chances are the Army
would have caught up with me anyway

36:24.880 --> 36:27.247
and I'd be sitting in the same place.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.402
You don't owe Isaacs anything either.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.767
You know how many American soldiers
were killed in action this month?

36:41.640 --> 36:43.768
Four thousand three hundred
and forty three.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.684
Nearly four times as many
as the same month last year.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.011
Add another 503 who died later
from injuries sustained on the battlefield,

36:52.080 --> 36:55.004
plus 61 missing and reported dead.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.606
Friendly fire, accidents, disease...

36:57.720 --> 37:00.530
That's another 1,817.

37:00.600 --> 37:05.288
Altogether, that's what? 6,724 lives.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.203
Add the Brits, the number doubles.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.931
Throw in the Soviets, they're overachievers.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.203
190,254.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.806
Germans, 41,200.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.288
Japan, Australia, Poland, France.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.526
Conservatively, let's say
10 million deaths in a year.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.728
833,000 a month.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.724
27,700 a day.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.485
11,057 an hour.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.484
What do you want me to do?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.643
Exactly.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.324
What's one more?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.366
I love you.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.045
I love you, too.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.046
What's wrong?

39:05.560 --> 39:07.449
We're building an atomic bomb.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.325
It'll set off a chain reaction
that will explode with the power

39:14.400 --> 39:17.483
of 20,000 tons of TNT.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.322
Twenty thousand tons?

39:24.160 --> 39:27.004
Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.722
Cities full of people.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.406
Children.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.526
No, the Army will detonate it
someplace where it can't hurt anyone.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.928
And when the Axis sees
what we're capable of,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.207
they'll have no choice.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.725
They will have to surrender.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.009
And then there will never be another war.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.728
That's what we're doing
behind those fences.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.168
We're writing the prologue to a new era.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.244
The history of peace.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.405
You see that?

40:39.880 --> 40:41.291
Bring it around.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:48.840 --> 40:51.923
- Hold it.
- We need ID from every passenger.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.924
You need ID from Henry Stimson?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.810
- Another egghead?
- The Secretary of War.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.606
Okay, let's go.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.801
Let them through. Let's go.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.041
Clear!

41:16.680 --> 41:18.842
Dr. Oppenheimer.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.406
Mr. Fisher.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.131
I'd say you spoiled my appetite,
but Reed Akley beat you to it.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.204
There's a personnel issue
we need to discuss.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.486
Right now.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.091
Get up.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.763
<i>When the Axis sees
what we're capable of,</i>

42:43.840 --> 42:46.161
<i>they'll have no choice.</i>

42:46.240 --> 42:47.730
<i>They will have to surrender.</i>

42:49.360 --> 42:52.648
<i>And then there will never be another war.</i>

42:54.480 --> 42:57.882
<i>That's what we're doing
behind those fences.</i>

42:57.960 --> 43:00.361
<i>We're writing the prologue to a new era.</i>

43:01.400 --> 43:03.402
<i>The history of peace.</i>

43:14.640 --> 43:16.165
Mr. Secretary.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.770
Dr. Oppenheimer.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.566
The last time anybody
kept me waiting this long,

43:21.640 --> 43:23.563
there was a coup d'état.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.165
And not a bloodless one.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.926
My apologies.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.527
We had to dot a few T's and cross a few I's.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.601
Hmm.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.008
- How was your flight?
- It didn't crash.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.845
Well, to small mercies.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.524
I wish it had.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.204
I wouldn't have to tell Roosevelt

43:41.280 --> 43:45.080
that he mortgaged the White House
for a handful of magic beans.

43:45.160 --> 43:46.810
I grant you this is a disappointment.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.851
You sold the President of the United States

43:50.920 --> 43:52.763
a Buck Rogers fantasy.

43:52.840 --> 43:55.241
You shook his hand and told him

43:55.360 --> 43:59.331
the design was entrusted to one
of the best minds in the country.

44:00.160 --> 44:05.610
And now that mind is getting sponged off
the dashboard of a Chrysler.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.842
Secretary Stimson, if I may...

44:10.360 --> 44:12.488
There is a backup plan.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.248
We kept a second design team alive

44:15.320 --> 44:17.971
- for circumstances just like these!
- The implosion group?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.610
That's your goddamn panacea?

44:19.680 --> 44:21.444
You told me yourself it's science fiction.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.010
Not anymore.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.008
The director of the implosion group
is one of the brightest lights on this hill.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.651
He solved the physics
almost singlehandedly.

44:31.960 --> 44:35.009
I'll let him walk you
through the details himself.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.405
This is Dr. Charles Isaacs.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.528
What happened to Frank Winter?

45:24.440 --> 45:26.488
<i>When the Axis sees
what we're capable of,</i>

45:26.560 --> 45:28.244
<i>they'll have no choice.</i>

45:28.720 --> 45:30.529
<i>They will have to surrender.</i>

45:31.600 --> 45:34.683
<i>And then there will never be another war.</i>

45:37.200 --> 45:39.931
<i>That's what we're doing
behind those fences.</i>

45:40.000 --> 45:42.321
<i>We're writing the prologue to a new era.</i>

45:43.240 --> 45:45.129
The history of peace.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.930
I've made mistakes.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.330
I've done things I'm not proud of,

46:07.400 --> 46:10.643
but I swear I did all of it
with you and Callie in mind.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.324
A few months ago,

46:15.400 --> 46:18.768
a physicist from another design group
came to me

46:18.880 --> 46:21.850
and he told me that his model
wasn't going to work.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.443
I revealed information
that I'd been sworn to keep secret,

46:28.120 --> 46:31.602
that we had a spy inside
the German atomic project

46:31.680 --> 46:33.967
and that Werner Heisenberg
was months ahead of us.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.084
<i>I knew the Army and the White House
would never right the ship on their own,</i>

46:38.160 --> 46:41.482
so Reed Akley and I

46:41.560 --> 46:43.483
engaged in a secret conspiracy

46:43.560 --> 46:47.690
to co-op the resources
of his group for implosion.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.645
<i>Akley promoted Charlie Isaacs
to cover our tracks.</i>

47:47.760 --> 47:49.808
<i>Set him up in case we ever got caught.</i>

47:50.720 --> 47:54.486
<i>The irony is, the only way we were
able to crack implosion</i>

47:54.600 --> 47:57.604
<i>is by stealing the theory
from a paper he wrote.</i>

47:58.520 --> 48:01.842
<i>Now that Akley's dead,
G-2s got that poor kid locked up.</i>

48:01.920 --> 48:03.729
<i>They think he is a spy,</i>

48:04.640 --> 48:06.881
<i>but he had no idea.</i>

48:08.720 --> 48:10.529
There's nothing I can do but stay the course

48:10.600 --> 48:13.763
for the good of the project,
for the sake of the future.

48:16.600 --> 48:19.251
We sacrifice the few to save the many.

48:54.960 --> 48:57.725
No, you gotta write down what he tells you.
He's the doctor.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.848
Well, that's...

48:59.920 --> 49:02.400
That's what happens
if you don't keep it elevated.

49:02.480 --> 49:06.041
Yeah. Listen, listen. I gotta... I have to go,

49:06.120 --> 49:09.169
but I will call you again soon, okay?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.321
Yeah. I love you, too, Mom.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.971
Excuse me.

49:28.360 --> 49:33.002
And differences of opinion...
Differences of opinion...

49:35.520 --> 49:37.761
As Charles Darwin so ably said...

49:37.840 --> 49:39.842
Gone but not forgotten.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.930
They said I wouldn't have to meet in person.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.441
Only under extraordinary conditions.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.123
- Things have changed.
- They're changing everywhere.

49:56.040 --> 49:58.361
Implosion is taking center stage.
