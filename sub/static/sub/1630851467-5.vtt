15:15.840 --> 15:18.640
Something other than coffee... Let me see.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.480
I have yuzu tea, juice, and...

15:23.360 --> 15:24.640
Oh, this is expired.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.160
I have wild parsley extract too.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.640
I'll have yuzu tea. Make it cold.

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
Okay.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.480
Cold.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.640
Wild parsley extract.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.240
[Ms. Kim Yu-mi]

15:57.880 --> 15:59.280
Hello, Ms. Kim. Did you finish?

16:00.520 --> 16:01.880
I'll check.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.960
This is good.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.560
Yes, Mr. Nam.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.160
It's okay. I checked it.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.320
[Thank you.]

16:28.480 --> 16:29.720
Thank goodness.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.560
Call me back if there are
any further issues. Bye.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.080
Woong. Where are you?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.800
I came to get something to drink.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.040
Are you done already?

16:51.240 --> 16:53.720
That was quick. I'll be right up.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.200
We still have time before the movie,
so take your time.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.720
Okay.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.880
His place is always clean.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.760
How does he keep it so clean?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.640
Does he clean every day?

17:29.280 --> 17:31.440
Gosh, this is really good.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.160
Is this homemade,

17:45.080 --> 17:46.560
not store-bought?

17:49.360 --> 17:53.560
[The slices of yuzu are thick and uneven.]

17:53.640 --> 17:58.720
And the visible grains of sugar
prove that it was made at home.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.960
At home?

18:00.040 --> 18:04.200
So if it's homemade,
did Woong's mom make it?

18:04.640 --> 18:08.880
Then Yu-mi's drinking
her mother-in-law's yuzu tea.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.560
Is that really it?

18:18.320 --> 18:19.480
There's no label on it.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.120
No. Something is suspicious.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.400
The jar that the preserve is in
is a design that young people like.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.360
Plus, it's not a lot.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
So what?

18:41.160 --> 18:43.880
Moms don't put preserves
in bottles like that.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.080
Moms usually fill jars like this
all the way to the top.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.800
Am I wrong?

18:55.880 --> 18:57.560
So what's your conclusion?

18:59.520 --> 19:00.760
[Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong.]

19:03.800 --> 19:04.880
No way.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.720
Based on my deductions...

19:07.960 --> 19:09.600
[The person who bought the yuzu,]

19:13.040 --> 19:14.480
[washed them in baking soda,]

19:16.160 --> 19:17.560
[disinfected the jar,]

19:18.680 --> 19:20.640
[cut up the yuzu into thin slices,]

19:22.080 --> 19:24.040
[mixed them with sugar,]

19:24.880 --> 19:27.320
[and gifted them to Woong...]

19:33.280 --> 19:34.360
Was it Sae-yi?

19:35.040 --> 19:37.640
[Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong.]

19:35.160 --> 19:37.360
"Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong."

19:44.360 --> 19:46.040
-Hey.
-Are you done?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.440
-Yes.
-Then let's go.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.760
Let me just put these in first.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.200
I went to buy drinks
because I didn't have any here.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.760
Why? The yuzu tea was good.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.360
-Really?
-Yes. It was really good.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.200
Is it homemade?

20:00.280 --> 20:01.400
Who made it?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
-Goo Woong.
-This is sour.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.240
Take one.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.880
-What is it?
-Yuzu preserve.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.600
Are you going to sell yuzu preserve?

20:11.680 --> 20:13.480
I have one for you. Take it.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
For me?

20:17.960 --> 20:21.080
I heard you had a cold.
Drink some morning and night.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.320
It'll make you feel better.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.800
[Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong.]

20:29.960 --> 20:31.640
You didn't make it, did you?

20:35.080 --> 20:36.240
Oh, this?

20:38.480 --> 20:39.960
When I had a cold--

20:40.880 --> 20:43.480
["When I had a cold,
Sae-yi made it for me"]

20:42.360 --> 20:47.320
[When I had a cold, Sae-yi made it for me
so that I would get better quickly.]

20:43.560 --> 20:45.840
"so that I would get better quickly."

20:45.920 --> 20:47.440
You want to say this?

20:47.520 --> 20:50.720
I don't want to hide anything from Yu-mi.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.640
I don't want to lie to her.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.960
Who said we should lie?

20:56.040 --> 20:58.440
I'm just saying we shouldn't add
unnecessary details.

20:59.280 --> 21:03.440
[Someone]

21:03.120 --> 21:04.200
Someone gave it to me.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.600
[Someone gave it to me.]

21:05.320 --> 21:06.920
[Someone gave it to him?]

21:07.400 --> 21:08.800
[That's it?]

21:09.920 --> 21:12.360
[I feel like something big was taken out.]

21:14.480 --> 21:15.720
It's really good.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.760
I don't know who made it,
but it's really good.

21:19.960 --> 21:20.960
I see.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.520
Let's go. We're going to be late.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.360
Again?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.640
No. I shouldn't tell them.
They won't want to hear it.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.000
[Intuition cell,]

21:46.080 --> 21:48.600
[whose talents were too scary to live
with the others in the village...]

21:48.680 --> 21:50.840
Nobody can hear me here, right?

21:50.920 --> 21:55.160
I got another hunch! I got a hunch!

21:55.560 --> 21:59.400
Yu-mi and Woong will end up...

21:59.640 --> 22:03.760
[At times, he figures out things
he wishes he never knew.]

22:06.720 --> 22:10.960
[Episode 13: Yu-mi's Birthday]

22:26.880 --> 22:27.880
Done.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.760
I won't need to do a pedicure, right?

22:35.360 --> 22:37.520
He won't see my toes
because I'll be wearing socks.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.160
[But what if you have to take them off?]

22:40.880 --> 22:42.800
[Who knows?]

22:43.280 --> 22:45.160
[Tomorrow is a special day.]

22:56.480 --> 22:57.560
What should I wear?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.160
[Yu-mi.]

23:00.160 --> 23:01.280
[What about underwear?]

23:04.560 --> 23:06.280
[You should pick out what you'll wear.]

23:06.720 --> 23:09.200
[Tomorrow is a special day, you know.]

23:14.120 --> 23:16.760
You need to look good.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.520
Hey, Lust.
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.600
You never know.
It's her birthday tomorrow.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.040
It's her birthday, but so what?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.840
Come on. You know.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.840
What's with him?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.160
Emotion, you're still up?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.440
I can't fall asleep.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.960
This birthday will be a happy one, right?

23:45.240 --> 23:47.520
She was so lonely in the past three years.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.920
I know.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.080
It's been so long since the last time
she wasn't lonely on her birthday.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.560
By the way, what's that?

23:54.640 --> 23:55.640
It's the moon.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.200
The moon is over there.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.520
Then what is that?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.000
Do you see the stalk at the top?

24:04.240 --> 24:06.080
It's green...

24:06.680 --> 24:07.840
-A yuzu fruit!
-A yuzu fruit!

24:09.000 --> 24:11.720
-Yuzu?
-What is it doing here?

24:11.800 --> 24:12.920
-Gosh.
-What's going on?

24:15.320 --> 24:18.640
[The one
that Sae-yi might have given him?]

24:27.440 --> 24:29.720
Woong is not on social media.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.840
Woong was Ugi's senior in college,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.600
[Met in college]

24:39.000 --> 24:41.960
and Sae-yi and Woong were classmates
in college.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.800
[College friends]

24:42.880 --> 24:44.080
[Met in college]

24:43.320 --> 24:44.320
Yes.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.880
I should check Ugi's social media page.

24:52.480 --> 24:56.120
[Looks delicious. Did you go with Woong?]

24:56.400 --> 24:57.480
Found her.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.480
This is Sae-yi.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.080
Seo Sae-yi.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.360
She's pretty.

25:15.960 --> 25:21.160
[Another late night.
We, Three Eagles, got this.]

25:16.600 --> 25:18.120
[Another late night.]

25:18.800 --> 25:21.080
[We, Three Eagles, got this.]

25:23.000 --> 25:24.040
[It's the weekend.]

25:24.440 --> 25:28.840
[I made some yuzu preserve.
I'll give it to my loved ones as gifts.]

25:24.480 --> 25:25.920
[I made some yuzu preserve.]

25:26.480 --> 25:28.360
[I'll give it to my loved ones as gifts.]

25:30.080 --> 25:31.240
[Who made it?]

25:31.840 --> 25:33.280
[Hurry up and get better, Goo Woong.]

25:32.240 --> 25:33.280
[Oh, this?]

25:33.360 --> 25:34.880
[I made some yuzu preserve.]

25:33.720 --> 25:34.840
[Someone gave it to me.]

25:44.920 --> 25:47.920
Sae-yi was the one who gave it to him!
That yuzu thing!

25:48.040 --> 25:49.760
He said someone gave it to him.
It was Sae-yi!

25:50.480 --> 25:52.760
Emotion, calm down.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.640
We have to deal with Sae-yi
now that Ruby is gone?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.000
Seriously!

25:56.080 --> 25:58.240
Calm down, Emotion.
It's her birthday tomorrow.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.200
She can't see Woong when she's this upset.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.600
Let go. I said, let go!

26:03.000 --> 26:04.560
-Let go!
-Come here.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.600
What's your problem? Let go!

26:07.760 --> 26:09.240
Repeat after me.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.480
We're calm.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.480
-We're calm.
-We're calm.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.200
Forget yuzu.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.600
-Forget yuzu.
-Forget yuzu.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.760
How do you feel now, cells?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.000
Have you found inner peace yet?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.440
Ma'am.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.440
Yes, Emotion.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.880
Have you managed to find inner peace?

26:30.800 --> 26:32.880
Finding inner peace

26:32.960 --> 26:34.680
is certainly not easy.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.760
So I'm just going to

26:36.880 --> 26:38.560
teach her a lesson!

26:39.440 --> 26:41.240
Emotion! Calm down.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.200
I can't.
Yu-mi needs to take it up with Woong.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.080
She should warn him now!

26:55.160 --> 26:58.040
[This late? It's almost midnight.]

26:58.840 --> 27:00.120
[Who cares?]

27:00.240 --> 27:03.360
[Lack of honesty
can destroy a relationship.]

27:05.120 --> 27:06.120
[Woong.]

27:06.760 --> 27:08.280
[Who gave you the yuzu preserve?]

27:08.040 --> 27:10.360
[Who gave you the yuzu preserve?]

27:10.440 --> 27:13.440
[Happy birthday.]

27:10.520 --> 27:11.640
[Happy birthday.]

27:13.320 --> 27:15.280
[It's past midnight,
so it's your birthday.]

27:13.520 --> 27:17.200
[Goo Woong: It's past midnight,
so it's your birthday.]

27:17.800 --> 27:19.840
[Sweet dreams.]

27:17.880 --> 27:18.960
[Sweet dreams.]

27:28.880 --> 27:31.800
-A heart!
-It turned into a heart.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.320
Emotion, must you give Woong a warning?

27:35.480 --> 27:36.880
No, there's no need.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.520
I've suddenly found inner peace.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.440
[Who gave you the yuzu preserve?]

27:51.560 --> 27:52.600
[Thanks, Woong.]

27:51.560 --> 27:54.280
[Thanks, Woong.]

27:53.840 --> 27:55.040
[Sweet dreams to you too.]

27:54.360 --> 27:59.800
[Sweet dreams to you too.]

27:57.040 --> 27:59.080
[Add another heart.]

28:02.040 --> 28:03.040
[One more.]

28:05.560 --> 28:08.000
[Thanks, Woong. Sweet dreams to you too.]

28:37.440 --> 28:38.560
Do you like this place?

28:39.560 --> 28:41.840
Yes, the food is good.
Everything is so delicious.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.240
Right, I forgot because I was too hungry.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.400
Stop eating for a second.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
I have to take photos.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.080
Of what I ate and who I was with
on my birthday.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.200
If I don't post photos like that,
my friends will pity me.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.560
There's no birthday card though.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.960
I can't write stuff like that.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.680
Woong.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.840
I want photos of this too.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
Done.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.280
Open it.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.160
-Here?
-Why not?

29:42.640 --> 29:43.680
What could this be?

29:45.320 --> 29:48.040
[The length of the box
is approximately 45cm.]

29:48.120 --> 29:49.880
[But it feels pretty light.]

29:50.440 --> 29:53.400
Then it must be a clutch.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.160
It has to be a clutch.
I'm betting all this money.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.320
I think I know what this is.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.400
Really?

30:02.280 --> 30:03.960
Doesn't it start with "C"?

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
Why don't you find out?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.680
I don't think it starts with "C".

30:10.760 --> 30:12.600
What? You tricked me.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.560
Let me guess again.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.200
The wrapping paper smells good.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.520
-Does it?
-The sales clerk must've sprayed perfume.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.920
So this must be...

30:27.000 --> 30:29.840
It must be perfume. I'm sure of it.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.600
It's not perfume.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.920
What is this?

30:50.040 --> 30:51.040
Earrings?

30:52.440 --> 30:53.480
I'm not sure.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.800
It's too big for a pair of earrings.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.080
So it must be...

31:03.080 --> 31:06.440
It's got to be a necklace.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.200
It seemed like you needed one.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.880
Am I wrong?

32:27.960 --> 32:28.960
No, you're right.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.440
Thanks.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.600

32:32.680 --> 32:35.160
Yes, of course. I totally needed this.

Gosh, I'm glad you like it.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.120
Thanks. I'll put it to good use.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.920
Darn it. What is that?
You call that a birthday gift?

32:50.880 --> 32:52.640
It's because
Woong is an engineering major.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.000
Engineering majors are obsessed
with electronic gadgets.

32:55.080 --> 32:58.120
Are you kidding me?
Not electronic gadgets are the same.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.960
A portable charger,
not even a Bluetooth speaker?

33:01.480 --> 33:04.240
Still, it must've been pricey.
It's a high-capacity one.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.880
It's not romantic.

This is her first birthday
with a boyfriend in three years.

I'll do it at home.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.920
Just turn it on.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.120
Hit the power button
and see if the light comes on.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.840
Right, okay. I'll call you back.
See you later.

Do you have somewhere to be?

35:45.160 --> 35:46.560
Well...

35:47.880 --> 35:51.160
Right. You mentioned
that you wanted to check out our office.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.160
What? Yes.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.400
Looks like I have to stop by the office
for a moment.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.560
Shall we go together after we finish this?

35:59.800 --> 36:01.440

She even did her own manicure
and pedicure!

36:26.600 --> 36:29.920
She also applied a facial mask last night,
so her skin looks great too.

She's even wearing nice underwear.

Her eyes can't be smiling.]

38:46.920 --> 38:48.040
[Why not?]

45:19.400 --> 45:22.840
You're welcome. We're friends.
Of course I should take care of him.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.600
Still, that was nice of you.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.720
By the way, I knew it'd look good on you.

45:30.920 --> 45:31.960
Pardon?

45:32.960 --> 45:35.960
The necklace. I picked it with him.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.760
He said it was for your birthday.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.400
He kept picking a weird one,
so I picked it for him.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.800
It looks good on you. Do you like it?

45:46.040 --> 45:47.120
Let's go.

46:00.680 --> 46:01.720
Wait.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.160
How did you come together?

46:04.440 --> 46:05.880
We met in the restroom.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.040
We even said hello.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.720
Then you all said hello.
You've met Louis before.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.040
Yes. Hello.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.840
-Hello.
-You interrupted their date.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.160
You should be responsible.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.280
I'm sorry, Yu-mi.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.600
It's fine.

46:23.080 --> 46:26.280
Yu-mi. It will take only ten minutes.
Wait here please.

46:26.360 --> 46:29.080
Yes, it's all right. Don't mind me.
Take your time.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.640
-Have...
-Have a seat here.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.600
Okay.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.320
Sit down and hurry up.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.360
Would you like something to eat?

46:39.160 --> 46:41.080
I've eaten a lot. I'm full.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.200
Still.

46:42.840 --> 46:43.840
Oh, right.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.240
The yuzu preserve I made is also here.

46:47.880 --> 46:48.960
Do you want it?

46:49.800 --> 46:50.840
I'm good.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.440
Okay.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.560
-UCK.
-C?

46:59.640 --> 47:00.680
Vector.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.520
Is that how it came out?

47:03.600 --> 47:05.320
-No.
-Look.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.760
The fog is gone, but where is everyone?

47:13.880 --> 47:15.360
Where did they all go?

47:15.600 --> 47:16.640
What?

47:18.120 --> 47:19.480
What's this?

47:24.400 --> 47:25.920
I've never seen this flower before.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.880
There's one too. Over there too.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.440
Don't get close.

47:38.880 --> 47:39.960
Love.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.960
Be careful. If you inhale the pollen,
you'll be addicted.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.120
Addicted?

47:45.520 --> 47:48.080
This is the flower of doubt.
It makes you doubt.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.440
I think Sae-yi spread them. Look.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.160
-Did Woong and Sae-yi...
-Emotion.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.720
What's going on between him and Sae-yi?

48:10.600 --> 48:13.240
The yuzu preserve is annoying.

48:13.320 --> 48:18.080
What are you doing in there?

48:19.680 --> 48:22.920
Why did you pick the necklace with her?

48:34.080 --> 48:36.320
Did you get the UI getting cut off
in the notch screen?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.840
I can't fix it right now,
so I left it as it is.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.320
What about the new icons in the shop?

48:41.400 --> 48:43.280
I edited them and built them again.

48:44.360 --> 48:47.880
What about the in-app purchase problem
when we tested it?

48:47.960 --> 48:49.680
I don't think that was us.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.560
Then is it the store?

48:51.640 --> 48:52.880
I think so.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.400
Let's try it first. If it still doesn't
work, let's send an inquiry.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.400
Are you bored?

49:18.360 --> 49:20.680
-No.
-It's taking longer than I thought.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.560
What do you want to grab after this?

49:23.720 --> 49:24.800
Anything.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.440
Anything? That's hard.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.760
You can go there.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.640
-Where?
-The place we always go.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.800
The pajeon place.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.240
I think Yu-mi doesn't like dongdongju.

49:36.720 --> 49:39.040
My. You don't like dongdongju?

49:39.960 --> 49:42.840
Well, it's not that I don't like it.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.840
Dongdongju is Woong's favorite.

49:44.920 --> 49:48.320
When we work overnight,
we always have pajeon and dongdongju.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.960
It's not my favorite.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.640
Yes, it is.

49:52.520 --> 49:55.840
Even if you don't like it, you should
drink it with him from time to time.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.400
He goes crazy for dongdongju.

50:10.320 --> 50:14.160
They drink dongdongju together every day.

50:14.480 --> 50:17.200
What's going on between you two?

50:25.960 --> 50:29.000
What are we supposed to do, Love?
More flowers are growing.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.800
I keep cutting them, but they won't stop
because of Sae-yi.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.680
Sae-yi keeps planting them.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.200
-What do we do?
-First,

50:35.280 --> 50:37.120
we should get away from Sae-yi.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.520
The code is working now.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.440
Let's run it one more time
and wrap it up for today.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.200
Okay. Let's take a break.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.600
I have to go pee.

50:57.240 --> 50:59.480
Yu-mi. Isn't it boring? I'm almost done...

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
What?

51:03.720 --> 51:04.720
Where did she go?

51:06.960 --> 51:08.320
Maybe she went to the restroom.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.440
What?

51:26.520 --> 51:29.640
[Woong. It looks like
it's going to take long.]

51:27.440 --> 51:30.480
[It looks like it's going to take long.
I'll just leave before I get in your way.]

51:29.720 --> 51:31.520
[I'll just leave
before I get in your way.]

51:31.600 --> 51:32.920
[Call me.]

51:51.280 --> 51:54.680
[Goo Woong]

52:00.760 --> 52:01.840
Hello?

52:02.280 --> 52:03.320
[Yu-mi. Where are you?]

52:04.520 --> 52:05.480
Are you done?

52:06.080 --> 52:07.080
Almost.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.160
I didn't know you texted.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.640
I thought you went to the restroom.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.320
You looked busy.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.640
I thought I'd only bother you.

52:16.920 --> 52:18.360
[I said I'll be done soon.]

52:19.960 --> 52:21.560
It was taking longer than I thought.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.800
Still. Why would you leave
without telling me?

52:23.960 --> 52:27.240
I couldn't interrupt you.
That's why I texted you.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.960
I was going to take you to a nice bar.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.440
It's okay.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.720
Grab a drink with your friends.
You worked hard.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.520
It's your birthday today.

52:39.160 --> 52:40.560
You already treated me out.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.800
Still.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.640
You already got me a gift.

52:45.160 --> 52:48.280
That's enough. You don't have to try more.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.880
Try?

52:51.160 --> 52:52.640
You don't have to worry about it.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
Yu-mi.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.040
Are you angry?

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
Me?

53:05.760 --> 53:07.080
Why would I be angry?

53:07.840 --> 53:11.160
You bought me delicious food
and an expensive necklace.

53:11.800 --> 53:12.960
I'm not angry.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.720
I'd be a bad person if I'm angry.

53:15.800 --> 53:16.840
But...

53:17.480 --> 53:18.520
But?

53:21.320 --> 53:23.680
Did you have to pick the necklace
with Sae-yi?

53:24.680 --> 53:27.120
Why didn't you say Sae-yi gave you
that yuzu preserve?

53:29.160 --> 53:30.920
-Yu-mi.
-I'm hanging up.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.680
Enjoy dongdongju and sleep well.

53:33.760 --> 53:35.080
[Wait. Hello?]

53:37.160 --> 53:38.160
Hello?

54:11.160 --> 54:12.240
Where's Yu-mi?

54:12.320 --> 54:13.440
She went home.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.920
Why?

54:15.040 --> 54:17.200
She thought it'd take long
and she'd interrupt us.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.120
Still, it would've been nice
if she came along.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.440
You said it's her birthday today.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.040
Is everything all right?

54:24.760 --> 54:26.400
Why did she leave without any words?

54:27.320 --> 54:28.680
Is she mad?

54:35.840 --> 54:36.960
Why is she mad?

54:38.360 --> 54:39.520
You don't know?

54:40.120 --> 54:41.800
How would I know?

54:42.880 --> 54:44.160
I think you know.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.240
Where are you going?

54:51.320 --> 54:52.360
Home.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.000
Aren't you going for dongdongju?

54:57.120 --> 54:59.000
Louis. Let's have dongdongju.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.280
That sounds good to me.

55:07.920 --> 55:09.600
My favorite is dongdongju?

55:10.480 --> 55:12.160
My favorite is beer.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.200
I drank it only because you ordered it.

55:28.640 --> 55:29.680
Thank you.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.480
Is there any more?

56:17.080 --> 56:18.680
Why did you say that?

56:19.600 --> 56:22.120
You should've just said
goodnight and hang up.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.200
Emotion. Are you okay?

56:40.280 --> 56:41.920
Reason. How's the situation here?

56:42.360 --> 56:44.040
No more flowers are growing.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.880
Because we're away from Sae-yi.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.680
Sae-yi's pretty toxic.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.920
It was a good idea to avoid Sae-yi,

56:51.000 --> 56:52.200
but what now?

56:52.280 --> 56:54.400
She can't wrap up her birthday like this.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.160
She has to meet Woong.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.840
[Woong. Where are you?]

57:14.240 --> 57:16.560
I'll go handle the rest of the flowers.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.040
Stay ready to go out until then.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.800
Fashion. Get up.

57:27.880 --> 57:29.960
-Why?
-She's on standby to go out.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.880
The date is not over yet.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.240
Clean-up. She's on standby to go out.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.040
Don't wash up and check makeup again.

57:40.680 --> 57:43.040
Okay. I will fix it smoothly.

57:50.240 --> 57:53.600
[Woong. Where are you?]

58:09.680 --> 58:10.720
Reason.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.480
Anything from Woong yet?

58:13.760 --> 58:15.120
He's not reading the texts.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.440
And there's no call.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.400
Is he busy drinking dongdongju
with his friends?

58:19.480 --> 58:21.200
What if he's not reading on purpose?

58:21.520 --> 58:22.960
He must be angry too.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.440
She shouldn't have said that.

58:25.720 --> 58:28.400
Let's wait. He'll call when he reads it.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.440
Reason. I feel weird.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.680
I'm so anxious.

58:55.760 --> 58:57.960
It's normal to feel anxious right now.

58:58.040 --> 59:01.480
What if they break up?

59:01.560 --> 59:03.240
Don't say that.

59:03.520 --> 59:06.520
If he doesn't text tomorrow,
they might break up.

59:06.600 --> 59:09.760
It's a date after many years.
It's so vain.

59:15.560 --> 59:17.200
[I'm the one who's upset.]

59:18.240 --> 59:19.680
[I'm the birthday girl.]

59:21.280 --> 59:23.600
[Why does it feel like
I'm getting punished?]

59:25.880 --> 59:27.160
[I'm upset.]

59:27.960 --> 59:30.160
[I'm the one who's upset.
I'm the birthday girl.]

59:28.640 --> 59:29.920
[I hate myself.]

59:30.240 --> 59:32.280
[Why does it feel like
I'm getting punished?]

59:34.000 --> 59:35.440
[I miss you.]

59:46.960 --> 59:48.280
[Let's call him.]

59:51.400 --> 59:52.880
He's not even reading the texts.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.840
[So let's call him.]

59:59.040 --> 1:00:01.960
[If not now, it'll be even harder
to call him tomorrow.]

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:21.560
Why isn't he picking up?

1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.960
He's not picking up.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:25.800
It's really over.

1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:29.200
Be quiet.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:38.720
[Hello?]

1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:43.360
[Yu-mi?]

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.160
-Hello?
[-Yes.]

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:48.480
[This is Louis.]

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:51.360
[Woong left his phone in the office.]

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.320
Oh, did he?

1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.120
[I thought you might be curious.]

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.120
Then

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:00.600
where's Woong now?

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:02.240
[He said he's going home.]

1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:05.960
Okay.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:07.400
Thanks.

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:41.400
He's here.

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:44.160
Woong's here. Woong came to her house.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:46.760
They're not breaking up.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:50.080
You were really anxious, weren't you?

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:13.560
Where are you going?

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:20.840
Where are you going at this hour?

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:24.440
Well...

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:27.080
What do you mean well?

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:33.640
What about you? What are you doing here?

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:38.560
What am I doing here?

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:40.560
[I'm here]

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:44.280
[to explain
because your voice bothered me.]

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:45.280
[I'm here to explain
because your voice bothered me.]

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:46.480
"And we didn't blow the candles."

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:48.040
[And we didn't blow the candles.
So I'm here to blow the candles together.]

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:48.200
"So I'm here to blow
the candles together."

1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:50.680
[Let's have some cake and talk.]

1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:50.440
"Let's have some cake and talk."

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:51.680
Let's go with that.

1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:53.480
That's too long.

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:56.560
Let's not say what's not necessary.

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:58.880
[I'm here to explain
because your voice bothered me.]

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:00.800
[And we didn't blow the candles.
So I'm here to blow the candles together.]

1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:01.920
[Let's eat.]

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:04.840
Let's eat.

1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:10.560
Oh, and about the necklace...

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:14.240
[I wanted to get you
the most beautiful necklace.]

1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.160
[But I have a terrible taste.]

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.400
[So I asked Sae-yi.]

1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:21.960
[That I want to get you a necklace
that looks best on you.]

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.200
[But I have a terrible taste.
So I asked Sae-yi.]

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:24.720
[That I want to get you a necklace
that looks best on you.]

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:25.440
[I just needed a woman's advice.]

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:26.480
[I just needed a woman's advice.]

1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:27.640
[I have a terrible taste.]

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:29.640
I have a terrible taste.

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:31.400
That's why.

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:34.200
Oh, and the yuzu preserve...

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:36.720
[I didn't tell you that yuzu preserve
was from Sae-yi]

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.800
[I didn't tell you that yuzu preserve
was from Sae-yi]

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:38.760
[only because]

1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:40.720
[only because I didn't think it'd matter.]

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.280
[I didn't think it'd matter.]

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.520
[I even forgot it was from Sae-yi.]

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:44.880
[I even forgot it was from Sae-yi.]

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.120
[Sorry I didn't tell you.]

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:46.800
[Sorry I didn't tell you.]

1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:48.000
[But it's a misunderstanding.]

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.280
[But it's a misunderstanding.]

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.160
[It's a misunderstanding.]

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:51.840
It's a misunderstanding.

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.240
Is that all?

1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.400
-Yes.
-Do you think that explains everything?

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.080
Because that's all.

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:30.720
Let's eat together.

1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:33.680
It's your favorite strawberry cake.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:36.880
But it's too late.

1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:38.520
My birthday is over.

1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.840
No, it's 11...

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:43.840
It's past midnight.

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.800
Still, the bar will be open late.

1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:48.480
Is there a bar nearby...

1:04:56.400 --> 1:04:57.400
Let's go up.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:00.800
Let's eat together.

1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:05.640
[Yumi's Cells]

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:06.600
[Shall we go on a trip?]

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:09.040
[-A trip?
-For two nights on the weekend.]

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:11.280
[There's a beach right in front.]

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:13.680
[They can go for a walk
early in the morning.]

1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:16.720
That is indecent.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:17.880
That's nice.

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.160
They only get reservations via phone
after noon.

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:22.200
[It's so popular.
If we're late, we'd miss it.]

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:23.720
-Don't worry.
-That doesn't matter.

1:06:23.800 --> 1:06:26.680
I love the glass shower.
Give me the glass shower.

1:06:26.800 --> 1:06:29.160
-Let's play innocent.
-She can't be a pervert.

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:31.440
[I got the room I didn't want.]

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:33.040
So I'm filing a complaint.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:34.320
[Woong. No.]
