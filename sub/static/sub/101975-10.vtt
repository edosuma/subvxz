10:23.106 --> 10:25.181
And it's only gotten worse
ever since I told her

10:25.200 --> 10:26.366
I was going to Nigeria.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.959
You know?

10:28.111 --> 10:32.130
Maybe she's just having a hard
time processing her feelings.

10:32.357 --> 10:34.357
To be honest, we all are.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.450
I want to keep her in the ER
for a bit,

10:36.470 --> 10:37.877
make sure she's feeling okay.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.545
And, selfishly,
I just like talking to her.

10:39.698 --> 10:40.864
She has some enlightening
stories about your childhood.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.715
Hey. You keep those to yourself.

10:42.868 --> 10:45.185
(Conrad laughs)

10:46.629 --> 10:49.814
We'll get you on that plane
with a clear conscience.

10:49.966 --> 10:53.276
-Appreciate it.
-(sighs)

10:54.546 --> 10:57.697
(phone chimes)

10:59.384 --> 11:02.218
-What's up?
-Looks like I got

11:02.237 --> 11:04.645
my first potential date
from my Indian matchmaker.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.739
Ooh. Anyone interesting?

11:06.833 --> 11:10.001
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, wait. Give me that.

11:10.729 --> 11:12.896
Dr. Pravesh?

11:12.914 --> 11:15.006
Your sickle cell patient
Rose Williams's labs came back.

11:15.233 --> 11:16.666
Everything looks fine.

11:17.493 --> 11:20.178
Okay. Cool. Doctor, thank you.

11:20.906 --> 11:22.681
Is something wrong?

11:22.832 --> 11:23.848
Dr. Devi, have you ever used

11:24.000 --> 11:25.575
-a match...?
-Mr. Benson in room 5202

11:25.593 --> 11:28.728
needs an EKG.
Can you handle that, please?

11:29.597 --> 11:31.731
-Sure.
-Thank you.

11:35.344 --> 11:37.654
You are not being helpful.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.622
(phone whooshes)

11:48.524 --> 11:49.782
Rose.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.101
That was a cryptic message
telling me to come in.

11:52.195 --> 11:54.771
-Is something wrong?
-Good news, actually.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.715
Your counts are excellent,
and you could never tell

11:56.866 --> 11:59.366
that you had a devastating
sickle cell crisis last month.

11:59.461 --> 12:01.886
-(laughs)
-Oh, that's a relief.

12:02.038 --> 12:04.614
Honestly, I feel healthier
and happier

12:04.632 --> 12:09.135
than I have felt
in a long time, but, um...

12:09.287 --> 12:12.455
admitting that sends a wave
of dread over me

12:12.474 --> 12:14.958
because I know it's temporary,
and I know

12:15.051 --> 12:18.236
that I'll never escape that,
not for the rest of my life.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.614
Here.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.986
Well... what if I told you
that might not be true?

12:27.138 --> 12:28.747
(sighs) We've been through this.

12:28.898 --> 12:32.566
Doctors always underestimate my
pain, but it is very, very real.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.068
I know. I know.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.070
But I've been doing
some research.

12:36.164 --> 12:39.165
There have been some
developments in gene therapy.

12:39.317 --> 12:44.170
Recent clinical trials
with good outcomes.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.598
There might be a cure, Rose.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.828
I've opened the soft tissue.

12:51.921 --> 12:53.646
Cerebellar retractor.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.169
Maybe less force.

13:00.188 --> 13:01.946
You don't want
to make your closure harder.

13:02.098 --> 13:04.674
Thank you
for the advice, Dr. Voss.

13:04.692 --> 13:06.359
Bovie?

13:06.511 --> 13:07.619
(snaps fingers)

13:18.298 --> 13:20.281
Elevating
the paraspinal musculature

13:20.300 --> 13:22.783
off of the periosteal plane.

13:22.877 --> 13:25.970
Sweeping it to the side.

13:26.197 --> 13:29.365
And... beautiful.

13:29.458 --> 13:32.535
Dr. Voss?
You're needed in the ER.

13:33.371 --> 13:36.964
And you're thinking,
I can waste the rest of my day

13:36.983 --> 13:38.708
babysitting
a perfectly capable surgeon,

13:38.726 --> 13:42.045
or I should move on to
an operation where I'd actually

13:42.063 --> 13:43.154
be useful.

13:43.381 --> 13:44.881
I'm fine with either choice.

13:44.974 --> 13:46.716
It's your hospital, your rules.

13:46.734 --> 13:50.995
You seem to have made
a miraculous recovery, Dr. Cain.

13:51.147 --> 13:53.239
Well done.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.242
Dr. Sutton,
learn all you can from this man.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.962
It's good to have you back,
Barrett.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.349
How is your mother?

14:11.576 --> 14:12.499
She's fine.

14:12.594 --> 14:14.668
She's likely somatizing
her anxiety.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.038
Conrad's doing a workup.

14:17.098 --> 14:19.691
All of this has
to be stressful for you.

14:19.842 --> 14:21.192
Well, for everybody.

14:21.419 --> 14:25.512
Turns out you and I are the
Beyoncé and Jay-Z of Chastain.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.608
(laughs)
I will stand for nothing less.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.368
You know, I never realized

14:30.595 --> 14:32.445
how us leaving would have
such an impact.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.765
Oh, yeah, the hugging,
kissing, crying.

14:35.783 --> 14:38.960
(laughing):
Oh, it's nauseating.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.290
Do you regret this?

14:44.442 --> 14:46.275
What?

14:46.294 --> 14:49.095
Moving to Nigeria with me?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.634
Listen to me.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.378
(Mina chuckles)

14:57.472 --> 15:01.641
I regret nothing.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.569
(phone chimes)

15:05.797 --> 15:07.647
Okay, that's my mom.

15:07.799 --> 15:11.659
Listen, we are good.

15:12.971 --> 15:15.121
Okay.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.566
Anything we need
to be worried about?

15:19.661 --> 15:20.734
Based on the test results,

15:20.754 --> 15:21.978
everything looks
completely normal.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.497
You see?
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.257
I am so embarrassed.

15:26.484 --> 15:29.260
Making such a fuss
about nothing.

15:29.487 --> 15:31.245
It's better
to be safe than sorry.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.007
No, it's more than that.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.434
This is supposed
to be AJ's last day.

15:36.661 --> 15:39.562
And here I came
and made it all about me.

15:40.348 --> 15:42.423
People often don't realize

15:42.442 --> 15:44.834
how powerful
the mind-body connection is.

15:44.852 --> 15:48.187
Sometimes, when your heart
breaks, your body does, too.

15:48.339 --> 15:50.597
It's good you came in.
It's important to take care

15:50.617 --> 15:52.358
of yourself,
even when things are hard.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.118
(door opens)

15:54.345 --> 15:56.345
Especially when things are hard.

15:56.364 --> 15:58.514
Thank you.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.107
Hey. Everything okay?

16:00.201 --> 16:01.517
CONRAD:
Labs and CT are normal.

16:01.610 --> 16:04.295
Just to be safe,
I'm gonna set up an appointment

16:04.447 --> 16:06.280
with her primary care physician.
She'll go

16:06.299 --> 16:07.948
-in the next couple days.
-Yes.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.616
So she doesn't have
to be admitted?

16:09.711 --> 16:11.135
There is no specific
medical reason to admit her.

16:11.362 --> 16:15.014
Please, AJ, I want to go home.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.533
You're sure, Mom?

16:17.626 --> 16:19.727
I'm sure.

16:20.796 --> 16:23.022
(monitor beeping)

16:24.000 --> 16:26.042
You have
to drill down the facet.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.352
Her hyperflexion injury
caused the bones to shift.

16:28.505 --> 16:29.803
We have to shave them down.

16:29.897 --> 16:33.324
That's arterial blood.
Vertebral artery.

16:33.476 --> 16:34.826
The bone was tamponading
the bleed.

16:34.977 --> 16:37.478
Give me suction.
Turn it up. Now.

16:37.572 --> 16:40.147
You'll have to remove bone to
expose and repair the artery.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.084
I know that. Drill.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.618
Dr. Cain?

16:52.770 --> 16:54.754
I got it. Hold on.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.331
Dr. Cain, I don't think you do.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.425
-Let me take over the surgery.
-Give me a second.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.077
If we wait,
you won't have to worry

17:01.095 --> 17:03.579
about her walking again.
She'll be brain dead.

17:03.672 --> 17:06.107
-Call Dr. Voss.
-Wait!

17:06.934 --> 17:09.152
Okay, take over.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.179
Suction here.
Hold it stable.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.866
Drilling above and below
to expose the artery.

17:15.017 --> 17:18.661
Two arterial ligation clamps
to me now.

17:28.030 --> 17:30.456
Hey, can you cover
for me in the ER?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.699
-For, like, an hour.
-Yeah, no problem.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.127
Does this have anything to do
with your date with Dr. Devi?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.797
(laughs)
Mina told me.

17:37.949 --> 17:39.782
Of course she did.

17:39.784 --> 17:42.134
No. So I have a meeting.

17:42.287 --> 17:44.044
Remember Rose,
our sickle cell patient?

17:44.138 --> 17:46.472
Of course. She's been
through hell and back.

17:46.624 --> 17:48.399
Well, I think I may have found
her a clinical trial

17:48.551 --> 17:49.901
using gene therapy.

17:50.128 --> 17:52.478
The founder of one of these
companies running the trial--

17:52.630 --> 17:55.222
he's an old college buddy
of mine, and he wrote this paper

17:55.316 --> 17:58.301
about how he's revolutionizing
sickle cell treatment,

17:58.319 --> 18:00.136
potentially curing it.

18:00.229 --> 18:02.471
Well, we both know
he'll be incentivized

18:02.490 --> 18:03.989
to publish
only the good outcomes

18:04.142 --> 18:05.808
and conveniently
leave out the bad.

18:05.827 --> 18:07.568
Like most pharma companies.

18:07.662 --> 18:08.994
Just keep an eye on that.

18:09.147 --> 18:11.738
Look, you know I'm not going
to get Rose involved

18:11.833 --> 18:14.908
in anything that I don't 100%
believe in. You know that.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.594
Of course I do. I trust you.

18:16.821 --> 18:19.222
I just don't trust Big Pharma.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.826
We both love Rose.

18:23.919 --> 18:27.563
Just...
I want this to work out for her.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.258
Yeah. Me, too.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.319
See you.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.601
(laughs)
Would you stop following me?

18:40.695 --> 18:43.012
-I work here, too.
-Yes, on another floor.

18:43.105 --> 18:44.605
Yet every time I turn around,
there you are.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.216
Well, maybe I want
to spend every last second

18:47.276 --> 18:48.534
that I can with you.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.943
Okay, if you're expecting me

18:49.963 --> 18:51.612
to have
some emotional breakdown--

18:51.706 --> 18:53.780
tears, wailing, and so on--
it's not gonna happen.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.708
How about you just admit
that you love us

18:55.860 --> 18:56.876
and you're gonna miss us?

18:57.028 --> 18:58.136
I do love you,
and I will miss you.

18:58.363 --> 18:59.637
You don't look like it.

18:59.864 --> 19:01.121
What do you mean?

19:01.141 --> 19:02.548
This is my "I love you" face.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.216
You're the worst.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.792
Okay, fine. You know what?
Go back to Nigeria.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.037
See if I care. But I will get
the goodbye I want.

19:08.055 --> 19:09.730
You can count on it.

19:16.564 --> 19:18.214
Phillip, dude,
you're still driving

19:18.307 --> 19:19.806
that nasty beater from college,

19:19.901 --> 19:21.734
and this is what
your lab looks like?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.495
That car treats me well, man.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.831
We had some good times

19:26.982 --> 19:28.741
rolling around Harvard Square
in that car.

19:28.893 --> 19:30.893
(chuckles)
No comment.

19:30.912 --> 19:33.487
(laughs)
Look, the way I see it,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.822
you got to put your money into
something that can do some good.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.567
And right now that's here.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.511
I'm proud of you, man.

19:40.663 --> 19:43.664
I always knew you'd be
a great hematologist, but...

19:43.683 --> 19:46.684
What? You didn't think I would
cure sickle cell anemia?

19:47.578 --> 19:49.353
Have you?

19:50.248 --> 19:52.690
We've completed
our gene therapy protocol

19:52.917 --> 19:54.341
in a total of five patients.

19:54.435 --> 19:56.194
All are currently
leading normal lives.

19:56.345 --> 19:59.179
-No more symptoms, no pain.
-Did you get a chance

19:59.273 --> 20:01.774
to look at my patient's
medical chart that I sent you?

20:01.926 --> 20:04.443
Yes. Keep in mind it doesn't
normally happen this fast.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.095
But we did just have
somebody drop out,

20:06.113 --> 20:09.281
and, I mean,
Rose is a perfect candidate.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.859
That said, I mean,
these are uncharted waters.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.104
There is a chance-- slight--

20:15.122 --> 20:17.048
that a patient could
come out worse.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.607
They could die.

20:18.701 --> 20:21.719
A lot of hospitals won't risk
hosting our trials.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.946
But you think Chastain should?

20:24.039 --> 20:26.373
Not think. Need.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.967
I know it's a lot to ask.

20:28.119 --> 20:31.637
But if I can convince your CEO
to become a site in this trial,

20:31.789 --> 20:32.972
we would be one step closer

20:33.124 --> 20:36.192
to eradicating sickle cell
from Atlanta.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.905
Look, I can probably get you
in the room,

20:41.132 --> 20:45.076
but Kit Voss--
she's a different kind of CEO.

20:45.227 --> 20:46.969
If she even suspects, Phillip,

20:47.062 --> 20:48.729
that this is about money
or profit...

20:48.748 --> 20:51.064
Just-just give me
a chance, okay?

20:51.084 --> 20:54.418
I will nail it, and then
you and me, Pravesh,

20:54.645 --> 20:56.629
we'll start changing the world.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.929
Ah.
(clears throat)

21:05.080 --> 21:07.490
We've taken enough time
on your last day, AJ.

21:07.508 --> 21:09.583
-You don't have to do this.
-Of course I don't have to, Ma.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.161
I want to.
You know, today made me realize

21:12.179 --> 21:13.771
that I've not spent enough
quality time

21:13.998 --> 21:16.665
-with you and Dad before I left.
-Oh.

21:16.759 --> 21:19.668
I just want to make sure you
get back, settled safely.

21:19.762 --> 21:21.837
We won't complain
about more time now, will we?

21:21.930 --> 21:23.114
(laughs)

21:23.341 --> 21:27.009
I want to apologize
for all day, really.

21:27.028 --> 21:29.528
Mom, you have nothing
to apologize for.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.347
Yes, I do.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.940
Ever since you told us
you were leaving, AJ,

21:33.993 --> 21:36.127
all I've thought about
is myself.

21:36.354 --> 21:38.187
About my own distress.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.630
About how much I'll miss you.

21:39.857 --> 21:42.282
But I should be happy for you,

21:42.302 --> 21:44.026
about the adventures
you'll be having

21:44.119 --> 21:47.546
with your darling Mina
at your side.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.300
Can you forgive your mother
for her selfishness?

21:52.127 --> 21:55.730
-Of course, Ma.
-(chuckles)

21:58.467 --> 22:01.134
-(coughing)
-You okay, babe?

22:01.154 --> 22:03.529
Mm-mm. (coughing)

22:06.551 --> 22:07.825
Take a deep breath.

22:08.052 --> 22:09.160
(coughs)

22:12.907 --> 22:16.016
Mom, we need to get you
back to Chastain.

22:16.077 --> 22:18.002
(coughing)

22:22.825 --> 22:24.750
(takes deep breath)

22:24.844 --> 22:27.011
You can say the words out loud.

22:27.238 --> 22:32.591
My mother has a tumor
in her lung.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.227
AJ, I'm-I'm so sorry.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.080
How could I have not seen this?

22:38.099 --> 22:39.748
CONRAD:
When she came into the ER,

22:39.767 --> 22:43.027
the exams and bloodwork we did
would not have caught this,

22:43.254 --> 22:45.011
but now we know.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.680
So we take this
one step at a time

22:46.699 --> 22:49.492
and we focus on the
circumstances in front of us.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.352
I'll do the surgery myself.

22:52.446 --> 22:55.039
You know that's not possible.
It's a conflict of interest.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.193
We do the surgery and the biopsy
at the same time.

23:00.287 --> 23:03.606
She'll need a segmentectomy
to remove the growth fully

23:03.699 --> 23:04.790
and maybe a lobectomy.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.444
She needs the best hands
we got, Hawkins.

23:08.462 --> 23:10.554
So let me do it.

23:16.044 --> 23:17.228
Thank you.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.068
Now I have to go tell her.

23:33.854 --> 23:36.563
I don't understand.

23:36.657 --> 23:39.917
A tumor in my lung?

23:40.068 --> 23:42.144
I've never smoked.

23:42.163 --> 23:43.996
And it could be benign,

23:44.148 --> 23:47.650
just a harmless growth,
but we don't know.

23:47.668 --> 23:49.835
And we can't diagnose it
from imaging alone,

23:49.987 --> 23:51.837
so we need to do a biopsy
just to be sure.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.340
-You gonna do it now?
-Yeah, you know,
the sooner, the better.

23:55.493 --> 23:58.494
Now, the good news is,
as far as we can tell,

23:58.512 --> 24:00.012
we caught it early.

24:00.164 --> 24:01.922
It looks localized.

24:02.016 --> 24:03.924
AJ.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.684
I need to know...

24:05.836 --> 24:08.612
what are my chances?

24:10.174 --> 24:12.950
Mom, biopsy first.

24:13.101 --> 24:16.770
Mina will do it.
She is the absolute best.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.605
So let's get our facts straight,

24:18.699 --> 24:21.333
and then we'll talk
about possibilities.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.794
It's going to be okay.

24:24.021 --> 24:28.966
-We are in this together.
-(whimpers)

24:32.046 --> 24:34.221
(sobbing)

24:36.867 --> 24:38.217
Look, this is not
about the money.

24:38.369 --> 24:39.885
And I know
when somebody says that,

24:39.979 --> 24:40.978
it is always about the money.

24:41.129 --> 24:43.981
Then what is this about,
Mr. Bondman?

24:44.132 --> 24:46.208
You're looking at me,
and you're thinking,

24:46.227 --> 24:48.468
"What is this white guy
from Harvard doing,

24:48.488 --> 24:51.230
trying to cure a predominantly
African American disease?"

24:51.382 --> 24:54.975
Well, I'll be honest with you,
it was a calculated decision.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.903
The technology is here--
CRISPR, gene therapy.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.889
There is a badly
underserved population.

25:00.908 --> 25:03.501
And if Bio South can solve
this problem,

25:03.728 --> 25:06.003
we would have the momentum
and the money to solve others.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.913
Bio South, Phillip Bondman

25:08.007 --> 25:10.549
would become synonymous
with curing people.

25:11.326 --> 25:13.902
I appreciate the honesty.

25:13.921 --> 25:16.663
But does this give Rose
a fighting chance

25:16.682 --> 25:19.575
-at battling her disease?
-Yes, it does.

25:19.668 --> 25:21.352
And not just Rose.

25:21.503 --> 25:23.262
We're a public hospital now,
so we're serving

25:23.414 --> 25:25.414
large sickle cell populations

25:25.432 --> 25:28.526
that can really benefit
from Phillip's work here.

25:35.926 --> 25:38.260
I want a cure, of course.

25:38.353 --> 25:41.764
And Rose deserves nothing less.

25:41.782 --> 25:44.767
But getting into bed
with Big Pharma...

25:44.901 --> 25:48.120
With all due respect,
Bio South is not Big Pharma.

25:48.272 --> 25:50.214
We couldn't be further from it.

25:50.365 --> 25:53.008
We are small, we're scrappy...

25:53.719 --> 25:55.294
...and we want to do good.

25:55.446 --> 25:56.628
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> So, what did you say?</i>

25:56.722 --> 25:58.113
That I'd consider it.

25:58.132 --> 25:59.539
In a perfect world,
there wouldn't be

25:59.559 --> 26:01.075
a financial incentive
to make better medicine.

26:01.077 --> 26:02.560
Yeah, but that's not
the world we live in,

26:02.787 --> 26:06.138
so what harm is there
in giving the guy a chance?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.399
The harm is, history is littered

26:08.550 --> 26:11.143
with examples of
dubious advancements in science

26:11.295 --> 26:13.237
coming at the cost
of a vulnerable population.

26:13.388 --> 26:16.648
The Tuskegee syphilis
experiment, Henrietta Lacks...

26:16.742 --> 26:17.966
Yeah, yeah, but in this case,

26:17.985 --> 26:19.802
the patients have
the most to gain.

26:20.729 --> 26:23.155
You know, a-a...
a cure for an ancient disease--

26:23.307 --> 26:24.990
how amazing would that be?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.586
It could also be
an opportunity to show

26:28.737 --> 26:30.254
that this is a new Chastain.

26:30.481 --> 26:33.591
One that will go to the ends
of the earth for its patients.

33:41.094 --> 33:45.930
You and I both know
the average life expectancy...

33:46.025 --> 33:48.250
is two years.
