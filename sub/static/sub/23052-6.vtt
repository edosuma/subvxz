00:42.959 --> 00:43.793
Mom?

00:44.753 --> 00:46.171
Oh, no, did I wake you?

00:47.630 --> 00:49.174
What are you doing up this early?

00:50.133 --> 00:54.137
You're going to school early again today,
aren't you?

00:55.096 --> 00:55.930
Yeah.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.224
Well, hurry up and eat, then.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.522
Okay, thank you for the food.

01:07.817 --> 01:08.943
Can I ask you something?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.198
Who are you meeting this early,
and for what?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.786
-That's a secret.
-I thought so. You're not doing anything bad, are you?

01:22.040 --> 01:22.874
Nope.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.294
Then fine.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.381
Take this with you.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.176
I'm worried you won't be able
to make it to lunch.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.429
Thanks, Mom.

01:42.101 --> 01:46.105
TOMAKOMAI CITY

02:00.620 --> 02:01.454
Morning. Morning.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.918
Here, I brought you breakfast.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.378
Sorry, Kayo.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.132
I'm sure you're bored here.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.390
I'm fine,
Hiromi brought me lots of books to read.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.477
I'm sure you'll only need to hold out
for another day or two.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.355
-Bye, then.
-Wait, Satoru...

02:52.130 --> 02:56.259
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, I JUST INCLUDED
EVERYTHING MY SON LIKES. -SACHIKO FUJINUMA

03:24.412 --> 03:26.039
Good morning.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.716
MARCH 4th (FRIDAY)

03:36.799 --> 03:38.051
-Haruko Nomura.
-Here.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.552
-Kaori Hasebe.
-Here. -Koichi Hamada.
-Here.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.222
Kayo Hinazuki.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.183
I guess Kayo is absent again.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.102
Satoru Fujinuma.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.313
Here.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.566
-Kazuma Horiguchi.
-Here.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.360
-Yuko Matsumoto.
-Here.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.403
-Misato Yanagihara.
-Here.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.032
I stopped by this morning,
but nobody answered.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.075
I see.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.701
That's worrisome.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.495
Yeah.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.082
You seem pretty calm considering, though.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.544
It's like they say.
It's best to stay calm at times like this.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.255
You're right.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.841
I called Kayo's house today and yesterday,
but nobody answered.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.846
-It seems her mother's missing work, too.
-Mr. Yashiro.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.933
Could you call the police
or Child Services?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.811
I called Child Services yesterday.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.147
They said they'd come today.
I'll go with them, too.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.777
My guess is the root of the problem
is likely the mother.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.029
<i>So, he was taking action on his end.</i>

04:40.738 --> 04:42.490
<i>You're a great teacher, Mr. Yashiro.</i>

04:52.667 --> 04:53.584
Ms. Hinazuki.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.503
We're from Child Services.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.090
The lights are on.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.301
Shall we try going around back?

05:12.937 --> 05:13.771
Ms. Hinazuki?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.370
The lights and heater are on.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.624
Her mother must have fled
from the back when we arrived.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.420
That's unfortunate. I was hoping
we could take the daughter into custody.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.214
Let's come back tomorrow morning.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.657
Oh, Satoru's back.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.917
Child Services came.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.835
Mr. Yashiro was with them, too.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.962
-What about Hina's mother?
-She wasn't there.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.674
But... I think this will all be over soon.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.593
Kayo.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.639
They're going
to take you away from your mother.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.979
That would make me really happy.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.400
I'll be fine.

06:43.277 --> 06:47.198
Because I feel warm
when I think about all of you.

06:53.955 --> 06:54.789
Satoru. Here.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.130
I know it's late, but happy birthday.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.431
KAYO HINAZUKI
BURNABLE TRASH

07:13.474 --> 07:15.268
<i>Sorry, Fujinuma.</i>

07:15.810 --> 07:19.397
I couldn't make your present in time.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.400
-I'll give it to you tomorrow.
-Okay.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.152
I promise.

07:43.087 --> 07:46.591
<i>I think I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this moment all this time.</i>

07:49.010 --> 07:49.844
Thank you. Kayo.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.098
I'll cherish them.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.938
Satoru,
you're more emotional than I thought.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.107
What? Oh, by the way...

08:15.995 --> 08:19.582
someone came here late last night.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.751
What?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.546
It seems he came to stash some things,
but...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.049
he was angry about something.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.759
I was scared.

08:31.052 --> 08:31.928
What did he leave?

09:07.922 --> 09:10.800
<i>Wasn't Hinazuki taken</i>
<i>to an industrial freezer</i>

09:10.883 --> 09:13.678
<i>where she was sprayed down</i>
<i>to freeze her quickly?</i>

09:36.742 --> 09:37.618
What are these?

09:38.119 --> 09:41.914
<i>We have to leave this bus.</i>
<i>We're still in the middle of the crime.</i>

09:42.790 --> 09:45.334
Let's all... get out of here.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.670
Yeah.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.381
I don't like the look of these.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.093
But, Satoru,
do you have a plan for what to do next?

09:57.013 --> 09:57.847
I do.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.766
Okay. Let's head out, then.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.811
Give me a hand, Hiromi.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.078
<i>What is this?</i> <i>Coal?</i>

10:25.875 --> 10:27.335
Can you give us a hand?

10:27.877 --> 10:28.711
Sure.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.817
This is your next big plan?

10:55.571 --> 10:56.572
It's simple, isn't it?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.959
<i>Time to take just... one step further.</i>

11:23.265 --> 11:24.100
Satoru.

11:24.975 --> 11:25.976
Explain.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.196
I didn't give up on this halfway through.
Here we are.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.625
Good job, you guys.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.045
I thought you'd say that.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.966
But I thought you might yell at me first.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.510
I've got nothing to yell at you about.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.263
You did this for your friend.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.517
Why don't you all stay
and have some curry?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.811
You can leave the rest to me.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.272
Come on in.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.442
I bet you were freezing.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.237
Thank you for this meal.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.496
-It's so delicious.
-Good, isn't it?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.373
Hello, is this Mr. Yashiro?

12:29.999 --> 12:34.962
This is Satoru Fujinuma's mother.
Satoru and Kayo have come home.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.841
Oh, thank goodness. I thought they would.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.052
I'm glad I didn't call the police.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.892
By the way, Ms. Fujinuma,
I have a favor to ask.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.574
Don't forget your vegetables.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.121
Kayo, why don't you spend the night here?
You can head home tomorrow morning.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.457
Mom...

13:54.124 --> 13:57.169
It'll be fine.
You've got nothing to worry about.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.965
You'd better clean your plates.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.413
Thank you for the lunch.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.708
Don't mention it.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.128
Hey, Kayo.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.340
Next time... let's make it together.

14:47.052 --> 14:47.887
Together?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.226
<i>Come on, Kayo!</i>

14:54.768 --> 14:56.937
You gotta ice it down!

14:57.229 --> 15:00.733
I'm the one who'll get criticized
if you go to school bruised up.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.926
You can come over anytime.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.802
Mom.

16:13.931 --> 16:14.932
Kayo!

16:15.015 --> 16:17.184
Where the hell have you been?!

16:21.480 --> 16:22.481
So, it was you.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.234
Making me worry for nothing.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.111
I am going to sue you for this.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.030
You were worried, were you?

16:31.991 --> 16:36.036
Tell me...
did you even go out once to look for Kayo?

16:36.745 --> 16:40.040
What? Are you trying to make me out
to be the bad guy?

16:40.582 --> 16:43.168
You're only worried about yourself.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.717
There's nothing more important to me
in this world than my child.

16:52.386 --> 16:56.640
I want you to remember.
There was a time you felt like that, too.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.768
You little piece of...

17:06.150 --> 17:07.984
Let go of me, Kayo! You idiot!

17:08.068 --> 17:08.986
Kayo!

17:09.069 --> 17:10.988
You'd better listen to me!

17:11.070 --> 17:11.905
Kayo!

17:13.906 --> 17:14.782
Kayo.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.493
Let go of me, you idiot! Kayo!

17:19.829 --> 17:20.664
Ms. Hinazuki.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.598
-These people are with Child Services.
-You are Akemi Hinazuki, I presume?

17:38.307 --> 17:41.018
We have come to discuss the matter
concerning you and Kayo.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.814
There's nothing to talk about.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.901
They're the ones
that kidnapped my daughter.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.487
Hurry up, and call the police!

18:07.211 --> 18:08.504
Thank you, Mr. Yashiro.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.550
No. You're the one
who spurred the adults to action.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.386
You tackled this head-on.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.974
We couldn't let your courageous actions
end in tragedy.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.063
Kayo's okay now.

18:28.023 --> 18:28.857
Mr. Yashiro. Shall we go?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.532
<i>I found Mr. Yashiro's words</i>

18:37.449 --> 18:39.910
<i>reassuring and comforting.</i>

18:41.203 --> 18:42.621
<i>I'm sure this is what...</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:45.374
<i>fatherly advice sounds like.</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:52.005
<i>Not having any memory of my father,</i>
<i>that was what came to mind.</i>

19:06.186 --> 19:07.020
Kayo...

20:19.718 --> 20:22.179
<i>The snow blankets the scenery in white.</i>

20:23.722 --> 20:25.390
<i>The future has been turned blank.</i>

20:27.142 --> 20:30.479
<i>All that's left of it are my memories</i>
<i>and hopes.</i>

20:32.356 --> 20:35.776
<i>I'd like to believe that</i>
<i>Kayo's future there</i>

20:36.777 --> 20:37.611
<i>is a bright one.</i> <i>Airi.</i>

20:58.257 --> 20:59.091
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:02.552
<i>You weren't taken by the police.</i>

21:11.019 --> 21:11.853
<i>Airi...</i> <i>Airi.</i>

21:18.944 --> 21:19.778
Airi!

21:27.703 --> 21:29.162
<i>I'm not returning to 2006.</i>

21:31.331 --> 21:32.332
<i>Does that mean...</i>

21:33.709 --> 21:35.502
<i>this isn't over?</i>

21:50.767 --> 21:54.062
<i>Is only saving Kayo... not enough?</i>

21:58.108 --> 21:59.735
<i>So, this won't end unless...</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:02.654
<i>I keep stopping the crimes</i>
<i>before they happen</i>

22:03.572 --> 22:04.948
<i>and catch the real killer?</i>

22:08.577 --> 22:12.331
Satoru's been like that since morning.
You think he's okay?

22:13.540 --> 22:17.002
-Well...
-Sorry. I forgot to hand out these papers.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.211
How many are still here?

22:24.843 --> 22:28.055
Sorry to drag you into this, Satoru.
I'm bad with directions.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.432
It's okay, I know where everyone lives. By the way, about Kayo's mother...

22:35.854 --> 22:38.190
she won't be able
to get near Kayo for a few years.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.110
It seems like her parental rights
will be suspended, too.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.113
Kayo will be safe now.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.200
-Thank you, Mr. Yashiro.
-I only did--

22:48.283 --> 22:50.285
Not about that.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.916
For your words, "We couldn't let
your courageous actions end in tragedy."

22:57.084 --> 23:00.045
They made me very happy.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.049
Well, you know...

23:05.759 --> 23:09.304
it might sound a little crass
to rephrase it like this...

23:09.387 --> 23:13.809
but basically you did what you needed
to do to get the results you wanted.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.978
Nothing can be gained by inaction.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.982
<i>Mr. Yashiro has some wise words.</i>

23:22.150 --> 23:24.736
<i>I feel better just listening to him.</i>

23:29.574 --> 23:32.577
By the way, Satoru,
was Kayo at your house the whole time?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.454
No, we had a hideout.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.166
We were in an abandoned bus,
behind Izumi Elementary.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.336
You found a good spot, then.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.218
Mr. Yashiro, something's poking out.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.928
Satoru, don't touch that.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.103
Satoru. You know my secret now.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.231
I'm sorry.

24:03.191 --> 24:06.653
But now...
I don't have to hide it anymore.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.622
Ever since I quit smoking three years ago,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.916
I basically replaced my addiction
with candy.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.752
I can't calm down unless I have some.

24:25.839 --> 24:28.592
I'm usually fine at school
or when I'm out in public, but...

24:30.886 --> 24:33.513
Satoru.
Eat up, you're my accomplice now.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.391
Oh, thank you.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.418
<i>I can't get motivated.</i>

25:05.003 --> 25:07.672
<i>Is it because I didn't get a real sense</i>
<i>of accomplishment?</i>

25:08.048 --> 25:08.882
Satoru.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.260
Can we talk alone for a bit?

25:13.970 --> 25:14.804
Okay.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.563
Satoru, what are you really thinking?

25:24.147 --> 25:26.691
Something about the way
you've been out of it

25:27.150 --> 25:28.610
makes me feel uneasy.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.949
I don't know,
maybe I feel relieved it went well?

25:34.032 --> 25:35.659
Maybe just getting careless.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.328
Does that mean...

25:39.579 --> 25:40.956
you think there's more?

25:41.539 --> 25:42.374
Like me.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.750
You do, too?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.543
What makes you think that?

25:47.254 --> 25:52.092
Maybe it's because I saw you throw a rock
at the house belonging to the Shiratoris.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.593
What?

25:55.178 --> 26:00.267
I've seen their son meet with Hinazuki
in the park a number of times.

26:01.851 --> 26:04.646
I was thinking that maybe you were trying

26:04.729 --> 26:07.774
to protect Hinazuki from him, too,
not just her mother.

26:08.775 --> 26:12.612
<i>I see. It was Kenya's testimony</i>
<i>that put Yuuki away.</i>

26:13.863 --> 26:14.906
It's the opposite.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.201
I know the son.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.122
He would never do anything wrong.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.792
But if something happened
to Hinazuki that day,

26:26.668 --> 26:30.005
I just had a thought
that he would get suspected somehow.

26:32.007 --> 26:36.428
So, that's why you made the family
call the police to give him an alibi.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.096
<i>Kenya's so smart.</i>

26:39.347 --> 26:42.600
<i>Much smarter than I am at 29 years old.</i>

26:43.727 --> 26:44.853
You're only 11.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.356
How can you be so perceptive?

26:56.239 --> 26:58.074
My dad's a lawyer.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.161
I decided to become one, too.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.832
You're only in grade school,
and you know what you want to be.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.585
There's a reason for that.

27:12.088 --> 27:12.922
My dad...

27:14.049 --> 27:16.509
is defending a murder case that happened

27:16.593 --> 27:18.470
in the next town over last fall.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.891
My dad's convinced his client is innocent.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.226
Really?

27:26.561 --> 27:29.814
My dad said these cases
are more common than you think.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.234
So, I thought I'd fix that.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.739
Hey, so that case...

27:38.448 --> 27:40.241
Can you tell me more about it?

27:42.285 --> 27:46.706
The victim was a 10-year-old girl.
She was locked inside the bath...

27:46.790 --> 27:47.707
CHITOSE CITY, FATHER ARRESTED
FOR MURDERING DAUGHTER

27:47.791 --> 27:49.876
<i>...and was killed by carbon monoxide</i>
<i>poisoning from a coal stove.</i>

27:49.959 --> 27:50.794
SLEEPING PILLS FOUND IN STOMACH,
KILLED BY COAL STOVE FUMES Coal stove?

28:03.390 --> 28:05.642
<i>Is it just a coincidence?</i>

28:06.305 --> 28:12.499
