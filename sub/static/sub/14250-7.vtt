Captain's Log, Stardate 50063.2.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.200
We've accepted an invitation
from the Nechani

00:09.200 --> 00:11.800
to take a few days' shore Ieave
on their worId.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.600
We're enjoying the opportunity
to Iearn about their cuIture.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.400
We're enjoying the opportunity
to Iearn about their cuIture.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.900
This sanctuary honors
our AncestraI Spirits.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.600
Their presence
is very strong here.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.100 --> 00:41.100
Those are brothers
of the Nechisti Order.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.100
They've devoted their Iives
to serving the Spirits.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.700
Here's something
you might find interesting.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.300
What do you think this means?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.900
Hard to teII.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.900
A fertiIity symboI, maybe?

00:58.900 --> 01:02.000
Or a bIessing
for good Iuck or wisdom.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.300
Or happiness and Iove.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.200
Do you hear something?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
What?

01:26.600 --> 01:28.300
Look at that.
It's beautifuI.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.100
It Iooks Iike a shrine.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.300
Come on, sweeting,
we don't want to be Ieft behind.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.000
I just want to take
a quick Iook.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.700
Kes!

01:53.300 --> 01:54.500
Kes.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.200
Can you hear me?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.300
HeIp!

01:58.400 --> 01:59.600
Somebody!

01:59.600 --> 02:01.100
We need heIp!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
What happened?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.400
Oh, you mustn't be here.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.600
This shrine is protected.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.200
She didn't touch anything.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.800
She went as far as that archway

03:58.800 --> 04:00.700
and then an energy fieId
knocked her down.

04:00.700 --> 04:01.700
Torres to Voyager

04:01.700 --> 04:02.800
We have a medicaI emergency.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.600
Beam Kes and NeeIix
directIy to Sick Bay.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.800
Yes, Lieutenant.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.300
Oh, this is most unfortunate.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.700
PIease, I must ask you
to Ieave as weII.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.700
We aren't going anywhere

04:15.700 --> 04:17.200
untiI we find out
what happened to her.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.000
What kind of energy
was she exposed to?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.800
I-I-I have no idea.

04:21.899 --> 04:22.900
This is a sacred pIace.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.400
OnIy the monks truIy understand
what happens here.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.400
Then we'II bring
scanning equipment down

04:27.500 --> 04:29.000
and investigate for ourseIves.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That's out of the question.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.300
It wouId show disrespect
to the Spirits.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.500
One of our crew has
been criticaIIy injured.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.000
We aren't going to stand
by and do nothing.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.100
There's nothing you can do.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.700
She's been punished
by the Spirits.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.700
She's going to die.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.300
If you prevent us
from heIping Kes,

04:42.300 --> 04:44.600
we wiII hoId you
directIy responsibIe

04:44.600 --> 04:46.300
for anything
that happens to her.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.200
I wiII make a fuII report
to our Captain.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.900
I'm sure you'II be hearing
from her.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.300
I'II be happy to taIk to her

04:52.300 --> 04:54.000
and to do
whatever I can to heIp,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.200
but your presence here

04:55.200 --> 04:57.200
onIy makes
a deIicate situation worse.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.400
PIease, Ieave now.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.600
Her Iife signs are
very weak but stabIe.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.100
It appears
that her synaptic pathways

05:10.200 --> 05:12.000
have undergone
a severe neuroIeptic shock,

05:12.100 --> 05:13.800
which is disrupting
aII corticaI functions.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.500
It is simiIar
to a comatose state,

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
but with none of the usuaI
biochemicaI markers.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.300
You can cure her, can't you?

05:20.300 --> 05:21.700
I can't even specuIate
on a treatment

05:21.800 --> 05:23.700
untiI I know more about
what caused her condition.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.900
We're working on that.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.200
We aren't aIIowed near the area
where the accident occurred,

05:27.300 --> 05:29.500
but Kim and Torres are scanning
the sanctuary from Voyager

05:29.600 --> 05:30.700
They'II report their findings

05:30.800 --> 05:33.800
to you and I have an appointment
to taIk to the magistrate.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.800
I'm hoping he'II be abIe

05:34.900 --> 05:36.200
to cut through some
of the restrictions

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
the monks have set up.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.700
Excuse me, Captain...

05:39.800 --> 05:42.300
I'd Iike to do something
to heIp.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.000
The Nechani must have records.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.600
Some kind of scientific data
on this energy fieId.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.300
Go down to the pIanet
and see what you can find.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.900
I'II be back soon.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.900
PIease understand, Captain,

06:00.900 --> 06:03.300
I'm caught in a most
difficuIt situation.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.700
I'm an officiaI
of the government

06:04.700 --> 06:06.100
not a spirituaI Ieader.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.100
I don't pretend to understand
why the Spirits do what they do.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.100
Then perhaps I couId
taIk with the brothers.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.500
I've asked the Nechisti CounciI
to give you an audience,

06:13.500 --> 06:16.400
but I'm afraid they consider
the matter cIosed.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.500
They've asked me to express
their sympathies for your Ioss.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.600
There is no Ioss at this point.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.300
Kes is stiII aIive.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.300
SureIy, there's some way
to treat her.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.900
Can't you insist that the monks
meet with me?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.700
We have an agreement
with the CounciI.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.000
They don't invoIve themseIves
with government

06:33.000 --> 06:35.600
and we don't interfere
in their spirituaI matters.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.900
It's been that way for centuries
and it's aIways

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
worked weII for us.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.800
Then can you teII me
what you do know

06:40.800 --> 06:42.900
about the sanctuary
and what happens there?

06:44.600 --> 06:45.800
I'II try.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.900
That particuIar shrine
is where the monks go

06:50.900 --> 06:53.400
to receive the gift
of purification--

06:53.400 --> 06:54.500
cIeansing of the souI.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.300
It is one of our
most hoIy pIaces.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.700
You mean the monks can enter it
without being harmed?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.100
They prepare themseIves
with a sacred rituaI

07:01.100 --> 07:04.100
during which they speak directIy
with the AncestraI Spirits.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.700
After that, they are abIe
to enter the shrine safeIy.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.900
What happens in that rituaI?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.100
How does it offer protection
against the energy fieId?

07:10.100 --> 07:13.000
Captain, you seem to want
expIanations for everything.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
I don't have them.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.100
OnIy the brothers who've
gone through the rituaI

07:16.200 --> 07:19.800
know what happens there,
and they're sworn to secrecy.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.500
The energy fieId
that Kes encountered--

07:23.600 --> 07:25.000
is there anyone
who couId give me

07:25.000 --> 07:27.400
scientific information
that wouId heIp us anaIyze it?

07:27.400 --> 07:31.200
AII we know is that it is a
naturaIIy occurring phenomenon.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.700
If you're teIIing me...

07:33.700 --> 07:37.000
that there's nothing
you can do to heIp Kes,

07:37.000 --> 07:38.500
I simpIy won't accept that.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
If I couId heIp you, I wouId.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.700
I swear it.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.900
I bIame myseIf.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.400
If I'd watched more carefuIIy,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.600
seen that she was approaching
the shrine...

07:51.700 --> 07:54.200
There's nothing more
to be done now.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.900
You have our sympathy.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.900
Have Kim and Torres
given you a report?

08:05.900 --> 08:08.400
Yes. I received
a fascinating Iesson

08:08.500 --> 08:10.600
in the chaIIenges of getting
cIear scanner readings

08:10.700 --> 08:12.200
through soIid rock.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.600
We were eventuaIIy abIe
to distinguish

08:14.700 --> 08:17.500
an intense biogenic fieId
at the site of Kes's accident.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.300
That wouId certainIy expIain
the neuroIeptic shock.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
She was Iucky not to have
been kiIIed instantIy.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.100
As I understand it,
the Nechani monks

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
are abIe to enter the fieId
without being harmed at aII.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.500
ReaIIy? I don't expect
they'd care to teII us how?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.000
No, they wouIdn't.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.200
She's not responding
to conventionaI treatments

08:42.200 --> 08:44.800
and frankIy, I'm running out
of unconventionaI ideas as weII.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.900
The IeveI of activity
in her brain is so Iow,

08:46.900 --> 08:48.500
I can't ruIe out the possibiIity

08:48.500 --> 08:50.800
of permanent damage,
even if I can revive her.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.800
The Ionger she stays
in this condition,

08:53.900 --> 08:56.800
the Iess IikeIy it is
she'II ever recover.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.900
How is she?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
I'm afraid there's
been no change.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.300
I've researched
everything I couId find

09:12.400 --> 09:14.100
about the sacred shrine.

09:14.100 --> 09:17.300
I didn't uncover
much scientific evidence,

09:17.300 --> 09:19.300
but there was one story--

09:19.300 --> 09:23.200
it was in a very oId text,
I'm not sure how reIiabIe--

09:23.300 --> 09:25.800
about a boy who recovered
from a condition Iike Kes's.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.100
He was a young prince.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.600
He wandered into
the shrine accidentaIIy

09:30.600 --> 09:32.400
and he went into a death sIeep.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.500
Everyone said it was
the wiII of the Spirits.

09:35.500 --> 09:40.600
His father, King Nevad,
refused to accept that,

09:40.600 --> 09:42.200
so he went through the rituaI

09:42.300 --> 09:45.000
to seek an audience
with the Spirits

09:45.000 --> 09:47.500
and he pIeaded
for his son's Iife.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.300
The Spirits,
in their infinite mercy,

09:50.300 --> 09:51.900
granted his request.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.600
That was the onIy trace of hope
that I couId find.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.100
Maybe it's enough.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.100
WeII, you've certainIy done
your research, Captain.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.600
I'm famiIiar with the story.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.800
I heard it as a chiId.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.100
It suggests that there's
stiII a chance for Kes.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.600
You're taIking
about a very specific case.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.500
Nevad was abIe to cIaim
responsibiIity for the prince,

10:13.500 --> 10:15.800
as a father and as a king.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.600
That's why the Spirits
were wiIIing to Iisten to him.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.100
The Captain of a starship

10:20.100 --> 10:23.400
is fuIIy responsibIe
for every member of her crew.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.400
So she is.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
Then on that basis,

10:28.500 --> 10:31.400
I'd Iike to go through
the rituaI myseIf.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.000
I haven't heard
from the magistrate yet,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.800
but he seemed to think
there was a strong possibiIity

10:42.900 --> 10:45.000
the monks wouId Iet me
go through the rituaI.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.300
Captain, forgive me,

10:46.300 --> 10:49.100
but you've never been
one to put much trust

10:49.200 --> 10:51.000
in reIigious ceremonies.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.200
ExactIy what is it
you hope to accompIish?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.800
If you're asking
whether I expect to speak

10:54.900 --> 10:57.200
to the AncestraI Spirits--
no, of course not.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.100
But something happens
to the monks

10:59.100 --> 11:00.900
when they go through the rituaI,

11:00.900 --> 11:03.200
something that aIIows them
to withstand the effects

11:03.300 --> 11:04.300
of the biogenic fieId.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.800
I want to find out what that is.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.700
It might provide cIues
to a treatment.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.700
Some kind of physioIogicaI
change, maybe.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.100
That's what I'm guessing.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.300
The shamans of the Karis Tribe
on DeIios VII practice a rituaI

11:14.300 --> 11:17.100
that increases the eIectricaI
resistance of their skin.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.400
It protects them

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
from pIasma discharges
in their sacred caves.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.900
Something simiIar must happen
during this rituaI.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.800
We'II have to find a way
to aIIow the Doctor

11:25.800 --> 11:27.300
to monitor
your physicaI condition

11:27.400 --> 11:30.300
and you shouId have a way to
caII for an emergency beam-out

11:30.300 --> 11:32.600
if you need it, as a precaution.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.100
We don't have any idea
what the rituaI entaiIs.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.200
I've been reviewing the
Federation's cuIturaI database.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.400
Most traditionaI
spirit quest ceremonies

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
invoIve some kind
of physicaI chaIIenge

11:42.600 --> 11:43.800
or a test of endurance--

11:43.900 --> 11:46.700
to prove the mastery
of spirit over body.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.400
My instinct teIIs me
this one wiII be simiIar.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.700
A series of ordeaIs that wiII
resuIt in biochemicaI changes.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.400
Of course, there's aIways
the possibiIity

11:55.400 --> 11:58.000
that the AncestraI Spirits
reaIIy do controI

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
what happens in the shrine.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.800
To each his own, Commander.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.000
But I imagine if we
scratched deep enough,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.300
we'd find a scientific basis
for most reIigious doctrines.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.400
I remember when my mother
taught me about the science

12:11.500 --> 12:13.400
underIying the vision quest.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.900
In a way I feIt... disappointed.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.800
Some of the mystery was gone.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.200
Maybe the Nechani have chosen
not to Iose the mystery.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.600
Under other circumstances,

12:22.600 --> 12:25.400
I'd be more than happy
to go aIong with their choice.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.000
Right now, it's kiIIing
one of my crew.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.300
Bridge to the Captain.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.400
Janeway here.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.200
You have
an incoming transmission

12:33.200 --> 12:34.300
from the magistrate.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.200
Put it through
to Chakotay's office.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.400
Aye, Captain.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.100
I must congratuIate you,
Captain.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.000
Your creative approach
to this probIem

12:45.100 --> 12:46.900
has fascinated
the Nechisti CounciI.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.600
Then they've approved
my request?

12:48.600 --> 12:49.700
EagerIy.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.000
They consider it an honor
that you want to seek

12:52.000 --> 12:53.200
the Spirits.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
The rituaI traditionaIIy
begins at sunset.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.300
A guide wiII meet you at
the entrance to the sanctuary.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.700
Thank you.
I appreciate your efforts.

13:01.700 --> 13:06.600
I have been greatIy troubIed
by your misfortune, Captain.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.200
If you are abIe
to convince the Spirits

13:09.300 --> 13:13.400
to spare your friend,
no one wouId be happier than I.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.100
Everything seems to be working.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.800
The subdermaI bioprobe
wiII transmit any changes

13:23.800 --> 13:25.100
in your biochemistry.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.300
And, Captain, the impIant aIso
contains a homing beacon,

13:28.300 --> 13:29.500
which we'II be abIe to pick up

13:29.600 --> 13:31.400
no matter how far
into the sanctuary you go.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.000
Just tap it Iike a combadge

13:33.000 --> 13:34.700
and we'II transport
you immediateIy.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.000
Thank you both.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.900
I don't think
that wiII be necessary.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.600
It is standard procedure

13:48.600 --> 13:50.500
to carry arms
on an away mission,

13:50.500 --> 13:52.400
particuIarIy when you
don't know what to expect.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.200
This is strictIy an
information-gathering mission.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.100
I don't want to appear hostiIe.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.300
Energize.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.400
I don't suppose
you know anything

14:54.400 --> 14:55.900
about chromodynamic Iights?

14:55.900 --> 14:58.100
No, not reaIIy.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.200
Oh...

15:02.200 --> 15:05.200
I suppose I couId Iook at it.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.000
They're as fussy
as Tarchee cats.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.600
You tune them too high,
they burn out.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
You tune them too Iow,
they sputter.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.800
I've toId the monks

15:11.900 --> 15:14.100
to repIace them aII
with neodyne Iights.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
It wouId save hours
of repair work.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.600
That device you've got,
what is that?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.300
It's caIIed a tricorder.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.300
A tricor...

15:20.400 --> 15:22.700
What exactIy does
a tricorder do?

15:22.700 --> 15:24.000
It's a scanning device.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.900
Interesting. May I?

15:25.900 --> 15:29.300
Oh. Atmospheric reading,
energy fieId anaIysis,

15:29.300 --> 15:31.200
fuII technicaI database.

15:31.300 --> 15:34.000
This is certainIy
a convenient thing to have.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.700
Oh, I didn't mean
for you to keep it.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.200
I'II need that back.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.300
Ah...

15:39.300 --> 15:40.400
No, you won't.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.500
You're my guide.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.200
Guide, advisor,
spirituaI companion--

15:47.300 --> 15:49.800
whatever term you prefer
is fine with me.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.400
WeII, why didn't you say
something earIier?

15:53.600 --> 15:55.600
ShaII we get started?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
It's aII right, Kathryn.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.500
WouId it be breaking
any vows of secrecy now

16:51.500 --> 16:53.500
to teII me what this rituaI
wiII invoIve?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.300
Why do you think I know?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.700
Haven't you been through
this before?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.300
Don't worry.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.000
I'II heIp you find your way.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.600
TeII me--

17:02.700 --> 17:04.500
have you compIeteIy
committed yourseIf

17:04.500 --> 17:06.000
to this journey?

17:06.099 --> 17:07.099
Yes.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.099
You're wiIIing to go through

17:09.099 --> 17:10.900
what the monks have
been doing for centuries

17:10.900 --> 17:12.099
to heIp them find the Spirits?

17:12.099 --> 17:13.500
Yes.

17:13.500 --> 17:18.000
So you can send biochemicaI data
back to your ship?

17:18.099 --> 17:19.900
No, it wasn't magic.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.099
Our bio-scanners detected the
microprobe under your skin.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.200
I hope that won't be a probIem.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.300
Makes no difference
at aII.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.700
You are fond of your IittIe
devices, aren't you?

17:30.700 --> 17:33.400
They've aIways served me weII.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.400
I'm sure they have.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.800
PIease, come this way.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.600
Who are you?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.200
I'm Kathryn Janeway.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.300
Is this where the rituaI begins?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.800
Oh, the rituaI... yes.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.400
We're waiting.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
Come, join us.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.300
What exactIy
are you waiting for?

18:06.400 --> 18:09.300
Just... waiting.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.400
How Iong have you been
sitting here?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.800
Uh, how Iong has it been?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.500
Why are you asking me?!

18:17.500 --> 18:18.700
I've Iost track!

18:18.700 --> 18:20.800
It's been a whiIe.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.900
I know that.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.300
Oh, it's been...

18:24.400 --> 18:28.300
as Iong as we can remember.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.500
Are you teIIing me
I have to wait a Iifetime

18:37.600 --> 18:39.300
before I can go
through the rituaI?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.700
I didn't hear anyone
say that, did you?

18:41.700 --> 18:45.500
CertainIy not, aII we said
was that we're waiting.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.300
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.900
The monks I saw in the sanctuary
were young.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.800
They couIdn't have waited
such a Iong time

18:52.900 --> 18:54.200
to go through their rituaIs.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.500
Now, she's right
about that, you know.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.300
She's a smart one.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.900
She thinks she is, at any rate.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.300
This is a test of some kind,
isn't it?

19:03.300 --> 19:05.300
To prove my determination.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.200
A test?
She thinks we're a test.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.200
What is she taIking about?

19:10.300 --> 19:11.700
She must Iike tests.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.000
I suppose tests
make sense to her.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.900
Has anyone ever tried
to open this door?

19:17.900 --> 19:21.600
How many times
do we have to teII you

19:21.600 --> 19:23.500
that we are waiting?!

19:23.500 --> 19:27.900
My dear, why don't
you just sit down and reIax?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.800
You're much too tense.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.300
You're weIcome to wait with us.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.300
I don't want to wait.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.900
I have a friend
who's depending on me.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.300
I have to go through
the rituaI.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.100
I wonder if she's
aIways this impatient!

19:39.100 --> 19:41.000
Oh, she's just determined.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.500
She wants to get on with it.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.100
Seems to me,
she couId be friendIy

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
and sit for a few minutes.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.900
No, no. She knows
what she wants to do.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.300
She's not the kind
to sit around

19:53.300 --> 19:55.900
when she has a mission
to accompIish.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.400
I toId you.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.700
I toId you it was Iocked.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.800
Yes?

20:17.700 --> 20:20.300
I mean no disrespect.

20:20.300 --> 20:23.500
But unIess there's something
I'm supposed to accompIish here,

20:23.600 --> 20:26.200
I'd Iike to continue
with the rituaI.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.800
By aII means.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.000
I'm not sure how to begin.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.600
Do you want me to give
you orders, Captain?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.900
I'II do whatever
you ask of me.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.300
I see.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.600
So you think
that this is just a matter

20:48.700 --> 20:50.100
of doing what you're toId.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.700
No, I'm sure there is
spirituaI significance

20:52.800 --> 20:54.700
behind the chaIIenges
invoIved.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.600
ChaIIenges?
That's what you expect.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.800
I don't have any idea
what to expect.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.500
I've studied a number
of rituaIistic societies

21:02.600 --> 21:04.000
and many of the rites
have commonaIities.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.200
This one may be
compIeteIy different.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.700
I'm wiIIing to do
whatever is necessary.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.200
I don't doubt that.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.700
But do you reaIize that aII
of this is meaningIess?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.300
That the onIy thing that matters

21:15.300 --> 21:18.000
is finding your connection
to the Spirits?

21:18.100 --> 21:20.500
I'm going to make
every effort to do that,

21:20.600 --> 21:24.100
but I didn't come here
for personaI enIightenment.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.700
I'm trying to save
a member of my crew.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.900
That's a worthy cause.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.100
I hope the Spirits
Iisten to you.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.200
Then Iet's begin.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.500
The first chaIIenge.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.100
Stand Iike this.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.500
HoId that.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.200
Mmm.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.300
Now...

21:48.400 --> 21:51.400
what do you see in your hands?

21:53.700 --> 21:57.700
I see... a stone.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.500
Keep Iooking.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.800
Her respiration and puIse
have remained steady.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.800
But there's been a graduaI
buiIdup of Iactic acid

22:09.900 --> 22:12.000
in her extensor muscIes
over the Iast hour.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.900
What does that mean?
Is she in danger?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Not at aII.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.300
She's probabIy experiencing
Iight strain.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.100
What you'd expect
in an endurance rituaI.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.000
Then there's nothing
so far

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
that wouId suggest
a treatment for Kes?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.800
It's too earIy to teII.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.100
I'm downIoading
every iota of information

22:29.100 --> 22:31.700
from the bioprobe sensors
into a physiometric program,

22:31.700 --> 22:33.300
which is anaIyzing the data.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.400
Even the smaIIest
physioIogicaI change

22:35.400 --> 22:36.800
may prove significant.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.600
We can't discount anything.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.600
What do you see now?

22:51.100 --> 22:54.800
I stiII see... a stone.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.700
I guess you're not
going to teII me

23:04.700 --> 23:05.700
what I'm supposed to draw.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.800
That wouId be too easy,
wouIdn't it?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.100
It's up to you--
draw whatever feeIs right.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.700
I've never been abIe to draw.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.900
My sister was the artist
in the famiIy.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.400
And you were the scientist.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.800
It's true.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.300
When other chiIdren
were outside pIaying games,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.500
I was doing
mathematics probIems.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.400
Mathematics? I can see
why you enjoyed it.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.700
SoIve a probIem, get an answer.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.400
The answer's either
right or wrong.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.300
It's very absoIute.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.300
I've aIways found that
satisfying.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.700
I'm sure you did.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.000
What did you see?

24:19.700 --> 24:21.600
I'm not sure.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.400
Describe it.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.700
Aha.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.500
What?!

24:31.600 --> 24:33.000
What is it?!

24:33.100 --> 24:34.700
What have you found?

24:34.700 --> 24:36.100
There have been
significant increases

24:36.100 --> 24:37.900
in the Captain's
respiration, neuropeptides

24:38.000 --> 24:40.500
and adenosine
triphosphate IeveIs.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.600
Is that bad?

24:41.600 --> 24:43.000
It certainIy suggests
she's going through

24:43.000 --> 24:44.700
a grueIing physicaI
experience.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.700
But it's the neuropeptides
that are interesting.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.500
The saturations have risen
to quite an abnormaI IeveI.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
Is that good or bad?

24:51.500 --> 24:53.700
I can't say it's either, so far
as the Captain is concerned.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.200
But it certainIy seems

24:55.200 --> 24:57.200
a substantiaI piece
of information.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.400
Neuropeptide IeveIs this high

24:59.500 --> 25:02.800
couId weII create a naturaI
barrier to biogenic energy.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.400
So you have something
that wiII heIp Kes.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.300
Not yet, but it's
the first piece of data

25:07.400 --> 25:09.700
that aIIows me even
to formuIate a hypothesis.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.900
It shouId be me going
through aII that.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.900
I was the one who Iet Kes
get hurt in the first pIace.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.300
Mr. NeeIix, you're waIIowing.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.300
I'm...

25:17.400 --> 25:18.300
WaIIowing in useIess remorse.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.500
I'II have to ask you to stop.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.000
It's bad for the patient.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.700
It's just frustrating
to be so heIpIess.

25:26.100 --> 25:31.300
If it's any consoIation,
Mr. NeeIix, I do understand.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.600
I'm exhausted.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.000
Oh, thank you.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.200
Your microprobe
shouId be transmitting

25:42.200 --> 25:45.500
aII kinds of interesting
information back to the ship.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.300
What is that?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.300
It's a nesset

25:53.400 --> 25:55.900
They're abIe to traveI
from this worId

25:55.900 --> 25:57.700
into the spirit reaIm.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.000
They serve as gatekeepers.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.000
Gatekeepers.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.800
Then I'm ready to enter
the spirit reaIm.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.900
Do you think you're ready?

26:10.100 --> 26:12.200
Yes, I do.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.100
Then you are.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.800
Go ahead.
Put your hand in.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.100
We can stop right now
if you Iike.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.600
No, I'm not quitting.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.300
Don't be afraid.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.800
Oh... it's burning me!

26:56.800 --> 26:57.800
Oh, my chest!

26:57.800 --> 26:59.600
Getting tight!

26:59.600 --> 27:02.600
Oh, oh, oh...

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
Captain?

27:16.300 --> 27:18.200
Captain?

27:18.300 --> 27:20.800
Kathryn?

27:20.900 --> 27:23.300
I'm dying.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.700
Everyone dies eventuaIIy.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.300
It's been three days
since she had any sIeep.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.100
How Iong are we going
to Iet her go through this?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.600
I understand your concern,
Commander,

27:39.700 --> 27:42.500
but I must point out
that her vitaI signs are stabIe.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.200
She seems to be
in no immediate danger.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.500
She's been poisoned
with some unknown toxin.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.800
It may be having an effect
we can't gauge.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.300
It couId Iie dormant
for a few days

27:50.300 --> 27:52.000
and then suddenIy fIuctuate
and kiII her in minutes.

27:52.100 --> 27:55.300
You seem to be impIying that
I'm not paying attention.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.400
I assure you, I am
monitoring her constantIy.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.200
If I thought she were
in jeopardy, I wouId act.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.700
Doctor, is there anything
which might be preventing her

28:01.700 --> 28:03.600
from using the homing signaI
in her impIant?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.700
Not that I'm aware of.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.700
She's fuIIy conscious
and has compIete motor controI.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.900
If she wanted to transport,
she couId signaI us.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.500
Are you getting enough
meaningfuI information

28:10.600 --> 28:12.800
to justify
her continuing this ordeaI?

28:12.800 --> 28:14.800
I am getting
some remarkabIe data.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.900
Her entire biochemistry

28:17.000 --> 28:20.300
is undergoing a series
of unique interactions. Look.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.300
This amino acid has been formed
as a resuIt of the breakdown

28:23.400 --> 28:24.900
of the toxin in her bIoodstream.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.500
It's affecting the normaI fIow
of neurotransmitters

28:27.500 --> 28:29.800
and very IikeIy having
a haIIucinogenic effect.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.000
Is she deIusionaI?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.900
I think she's experiencing
the Nechani version

28:32.900 --> 28:34.100
of a psychoactive drug.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.000
Then is it possibIe
she's in no condition

28:36.000 --> 28:37.300
to activate the homing signaI?

28:37.400 --> 28:39.000
I don't beIieve that's the case

28:39.000 --> 28:40.900
and I strongIy suspect
this biochemicaI change

28:41.000 --> 28:43.200
is going to give us
the answers we need.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.100
The toxin in her bIoodstream

28:45.100 --> 28:47.600
may very weII be the key
to creating a treatment for Kes.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.900
Commander, the decision
is uItimateIy yours, of course.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.300
However, I beIieve it wouId be
the Captain's desire

28:53.400 --> 28:54.900
to compIete the rituaI.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.700
AII right. We'II Ieave
her there for now.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.900
But I'm not moving from this
monitor untiI she gets back.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.800
Oh.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.700
What is this?

29:34.200 --> 29:36.200
An haIIucination?

29:36.200 --> 29:39.400
I'm onIy here
to serve as a voice--

29:39.400 --> 29:43.000
an interpreter
for the AncestraI Spirits.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I see.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.300
If there are other beings here,
couId I see them myseIf?

29:51.300 --> 29:54.700
You mean you want proof
that we exist?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.600
That wouId be heIpfuI.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.300
It's irreIevant.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.700
I don't want to be
disrespectfuI.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.100
I have gone through
every part of the rituaI

30:05.100 --> 30:07.600
that I have been asked to.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.900
Everything you've gone through
is meaningIess.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.100
You've been toId that.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.300
I know.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.600
I just want to bring this
to compIetion--

30:18.600 --> 30:20.700
to make my request.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.600
Then, by aII means, do so.

30:29.500 --> 30:33.700
I cite the story
of King Nevad as precedent.

30:34.900 --> 30:38.200
In the same way
he pIeaded for his son,

30:38.200 --> 30:42.800
I ask that Kes
be restored to heaIth.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.600
Your request is inconsequentiaI.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.300
You have what you need
to save her yourseIf.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.100
WeIcome back.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.300
How Iong?

31:01.400 --> 31:02.600
Does that matter?

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
Oh...

31:03.700 --> 31:05.300
I'd Iike to know.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.400
39 hours.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.200
You must take care
of yourseIf.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.200
Your body's weak.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.900
I guess the physicaI
conditioning programs

31:13.000 --> 31:16.100
on the hoIodeck didn't
quite prepare me for this.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.600
Has it been worthwhiIe?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
I think so.

31:22.900 --> 31:27.100
I was toId that I had
what I needed to save Kes.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.800
Then it must be true.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.400
The Spirits wouId not
deceive you.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.400
Whenever you're ready.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.300
Thank you.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.700
You couId use a good night's
sIeep and a soIid meaI,

32:05.700 --> 32:08.800
but otherwise,
you're in good shape.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.800
When can you begin treating Kes?

32:10.900 --> 32:11.900
Right away.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.700
The rituaI may have been arduous
for you, Captain,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.900
but it was certainIy worthwhiIe.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.900
As I suspected,
the toxin was the key.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.900
That's what produces
the naturaI immunity

32:20.900 --> 32:21.900
the Nechani monks acquire

32:22.000 --> 32:23.500
before they enter
the biogenic fieId.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.100
How does that transIate
into a cure for Kes?

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
I've created
a physiometric program

32:28.200 --> 32:32.300
to anaIyze the immune mechanism
and deveIop a treatment regimen.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.500
Then Iet's get started.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.300
Captain, if you'II excuse me.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.500
I'm probabIy more usefuI
on the Bridge right now.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.500
I'II carry out
the treatment in stages

32:50.600 --> 32:53.000
to reduce the physicaI stress
from the metaboIic changes.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.600
What's that?
Is something wrong?

32:56.700 --> 32:57.700
I don't beIieve so.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.000
Hmm. Her eIectroIyte baIance
is deviating,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.700
but that's not entireIy
unexpected.

33:04.700 --> 33:05.700
It isn't.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.900
Hmm...

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
What does that mean--
''hmm'' what?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.600
Mr. NeeIix, if you keep on
pestering me with questions,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.600
I won't be abIe to concentrate
on what I'm doing.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.400
Something is wrong.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.700
What is it, Doctor?

33:23.100 --> 33:25.300
Her cardiac functions
are being disrupted.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.100
I don't understand it.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.800
Lectrazine shouId counteract
the disruptions.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.700
This is baffIing.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.200
Her biochemicaI IeveIs
are exactIy what they need to be

33:39.200 --> 33:40.600
to correct the damage.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.000
She shouId be awake and aIert.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.200
Then why isn't she?!

33:43.300 --> 33:44.600
I can't expIain it.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.100
Her vitaI signs are unstabIe.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.700
I have to discontinue treatment.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.900
I don't understand it.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.000
Can't we try again?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
It's too dangerous.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.300
Do you have any other options?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.300
No.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.800
I'm sorry, Captain,

34:03.900 --> 34:07.200
but it appears that everything
you went through...

34:07.300 --> 34:08.600
was meaningIess.

34:26.699 --> 34:29.000
You meant what you
said, didn't you?

34:29.100 --> 34:31.600
Everything I went
through was meaningIess.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.800
Yes.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.100
I did everything
you asked of me.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.000
You Ied me to beIieve that
wouId aIIow me to heIp Kes.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.500
I haven't Ied you anywhere,
Kathryn.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.300
You've taken me aIong
wherever you wanted to go.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.000
This was your rituaI.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.100
You set these chaIIenges
for yourseIf.

34:49.100 --> 34:52.600
It's true that I came here
with certain expectations...

34:55.699 --> 34:58.600
Are you saying
that you simpIy...

34:58.600 --> 35:01.500
fuIfiIIed my expectations?

35:01.500 --> 35:04.500
You'd have settIed
for nothing eIse.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.300
I'm not ready to give up.

35:07.300 --> 35:11.300
If there's stiII a way
to save Kes, I want to try.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.900
You've come back
to seek the Spirits.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.600
I don't know what I'm seeking.

35:20.100 --> 35:23.300
Then I beIieve
you are ready to begin.

35:31.700 --> 35:35.100
WeII. Look who's come back.

35:42.900 --> 35:46.200
So, your IittIe adventure
didn't quite work out

35:46.200 --> 35:47.300
the way you'd pIanned it.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.600
You put yourseIf through
a Iot of troubIe

35:49.700 --> 35:51.800
and for nothing, didn't you?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.800
Don't feeI bad.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.800
You wouIdn't beIieve
some of the things

35:55.900 --> 35:57.500
peopIe have done to themseIves

35:57.600 --> 35:59.300
on their way
to seek the Spirits.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.300
So there's no reaI rituaI
after aII.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.400
''ReaI'' is such a reIative term.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.100
Most of the chaIIenges in Iife

36:06.200 --> 36:08.300
are the ones we create
for ourseIves.

36:08.300 --> 36:12.600
And you are particuIarIy hard
on yourseIf, aren't you?

36:12.600 --> 36:15.800
I've aIways been driven
to succeed.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.400
Stubborn, I'd say.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.200
You didn't reaIIy consider

36:20.200 --> 36:22.200
sitting and waiting
with us, did you?

36:22.300 --> 36:25.600
WeII, I'm here now,
and I'm asking for your heIp.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.700
I want to understand the purpose

36:27.700 --> 36:30.800
of waiting in this room.

36:30.900 --> 36:34.100
But isn't it enough
to sit and be sociabIe?

36:34.100 --> 36:36.400
We're good company.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.200
That's what I'm supposed to do--

36:39.300 --> 36:42.200
taIk to the AncestraI Spirits.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.200
Oh...

36:43.300 --> 36:45.000
first, we were a test,

36:45.100 --> 36:48.100
and now we're
the AncestraI Spirits.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.000
Are you?

36:51.100 --> 36:54.000
That wouId be nice
and quantifiabIe for you,

36:54.100 --> 36:55.800
wouIdn't it?

36:55.800 --> 36:57.500
If the Spirits were something

36:57.500 --> 36:59.700
that you couId see
and touch and scan

36:59.700 --> 37:01.500
with your IittIe devices.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.400
If you can expIain everything,

37:03.400 --> 37:05.600
what's Ieft to beIieve in?

37:06.900 --> 37:09.400
I know it's an important part
of your reIigion

37:09.400 --> 37:11.600
to trust the Spirits
without question,

37:11.600 --> 37:13.900
but I wasn't brought up
that way.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.900
It's hard for me to accept.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.400
So much for your toIerant,
open-minded StarfIeet ideaIs.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.800
There's a difference
between respecting

37:21.800 --> 37:24.300
the spirituaI beIiefs
of other cuItures

37:24.300 --> 37:26.000
and embracing them myseIf.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.500
Fine. Don't embrace a thing.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.700
It's aII the same to us.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.100
Go on back to your ship

37:30.100 --> 37:32.800
and pIay with your
moIecuIar microscanner.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.500
You've tried aII that aIready,

37:35.500 --> 37:38.200
but it didn't work, did it?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.900
Kes didn't get better.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.300
No, she didn't.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.300
Why not?

37:42.300 --> 37:44.200
The Doctor couIdn't expIain it.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.200
So it's inexpIicabIe.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.900
A miracuIous nonrecovery.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.100
We haven't found the reason yet.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.800
But of course you wiII.

37:52.900 --> 37:57.200
You'II find
aII the answers eventuaIIy

37:57.200 --> 38:02.200
with enough time and study
and the right sort of tooIs.

38:02.300 --> 38:05.200
That's what you beIieve,
isn't it, as a scientist?

38:05.300 --> 38:07.100
Be honest.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.700
Yes, that's what
I've aIways beIieved.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.700
Even when her science faiIs
right before her eyes,

38:14.800 --> 38:17.000
she stiII has
fuII confidence in it.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Now there's a Ieap of faith.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.200
UnconditionaI trust.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.900
Now that's promising.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.700
AII right...

38:25.700 --> 38:30.700
if you're saying that science
won't heIp Kes, what wiII?

38:30.800 --> 38:31.900
You won't Iike it.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
I'm wiIIing to do
whatever's necessary.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.400
KiII her.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.100
She's as good as dead aIready.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.700
Finish the job.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.600
Give her another joIt of that--

38:43.700 --> 38:44.900
what do you caII it?--

38:45.000 --> 38:46.300
biogenic fieId.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.600
Oh... that wouId do it.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.400
It wouId do what exactIy?

38:51.500 --> 38:52.700
There you go again.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.400
AIways Iooking
for a rationaI expIanation.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.900
WeII, there isn't one.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.300
Your orbitaI scans
and medicaI research

39:00.300 --> 39:02.500
have given you the facts...

39:02.500 --> 39:07.800
and they teII you
the biogenic fieId is IethaI.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.500
If you beIieve the facts.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.200
Let aII of that go, Kathryn.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.100
Take Kes back into the shrine

39:15.200 --> 39:18.100
and trust the Spirits
to return her souI.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.500
The rituaI I went through
was meaningIess...

39:24.500 --> 39:26.900
and Kes has done nothing
to prepare herseIf.

39:26.900 --> 39:30.000
How couId either of us be ready
to go through the fieId?

39:30.000 --> 39:33.900
If you beIieve you're ready,
then you are.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.300
There's no more to it than that.

39:37.300 --> 39:42.800
But if you go in with any doubt,
with any hesitation,

39:42.900 --> 39:45.000
then you're both dead.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.500
So...

39:47.500 --> 39:51.000
what are you going to do...
Captain?

39:51.000 --> 39:54.700
You know I won't stand by
and watch Kes die

39:54.800 --> 39:57.100
if there's anything I can do
to save her.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.800
I want to beIieve it's possibIe.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.800
I'm going to try.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.100
Janeway to Chakotay.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.100
Captain, we've been worried
about you.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.500
I'm aII right.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.300
I want you to beam Kes down here
to the sanctuary.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.700
AcknowIedged.
I'II bring her down myseIf.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.100
Chakotay to Sick Bay.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.900
Doctor, prepare Kes
for transport.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.200
Understood.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.700
The Doctor says her Iife signs
are deteriorating.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.900
He aImost wouIdn't Iet us
take her out of Sick Bay.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.200
You've found a way to heIp her.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.300
Yes, I have.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.300
I'm taking her back
into the biogenic fieId.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.600
I hate to question you, Captain,
but why?

40:54.700 --> 40:57.300
I beIieve it wiII save her Iife.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.900
You have some new information
on the effects of the fieId?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.100
I can't expIain it to you.

41:02.200 --> 41:07.000
Captain... you've been through
a Iot in the past few days.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.000
I know what I'm doing.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.200
Are you sure of that?

41:10.300 --> 41:13.800
There are 800 megajouIes
of biogenic energy running

41:13.800 --> 41:15.000
through that shrine.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.700
The thoron radiation IeveIs
are off the scaIe.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.900
That's what you'd be taking
her and yourseIf into.

41:20.900 --> 41:23.000
Why don't you take some
time to think about this

41:23.100 --> 41:24.900
and Iet us run a few more scans?

41:24.900 --> 41:27.500
No.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.300
Captain...

41:30.300 --> 41:32.100
this isn't Iike you.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.500
You know you'II aIways have
my gratitude

41:34.600 --> 41:36.500
for everything you've done
to save Kes,

41:36.500 --> 41:39.500
but I couIdn't--
and I know she couIdn't--

41:39.500 --> 41:41.800
ask you to risk your own Iife
Iike this.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
There are too many other peopIe
who need you.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.500
He's right.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.800
It's my responsibiIity
to keep you safe--

41:47.900 --> 41:49.900
for the crew's sake,
if not for your own.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.300
I'd rather not have
to reIieve you of duty,

41:52.300 --> 41:54.500
but if your judgment's
been impaired in any way...

41:54.500 --> 41:57.100
He can't reaIIy do that, can he?

41:57.100 --> 41:59.100
Yes, he can.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.500
I suppose it might be necessary

42:02.500 --> 42:05.300
if the Captain of a ship
were reaIIy mentaIIy impaired,

42:05.300 --> 42:08.000
but you're not crazy, Kathryn.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.500
You know that.

42:09.500 --> 42:12.000
These are the same peopIe
who were wiIIing

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
to Iet Kes die just for
disturbing their shrine.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.100
Can you take their word for it
that you'II be safe in there?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.100
I can't give you
my word on that.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.600
Nobody knows what
wiII happen to them

42:23.600 --> 42:26.100
in the shrine untiI they go in.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.700
I don't know the answers...

42:28.800 --> 42:30.700
but you do.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.100
Captain...

42:43.100 --> 42:45.000
I don't understand this.

42:45.100 --> 42:47.300
Neither do I.

42:47.300 --> 42:50.100
That's the chaIIenge.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.100
Kes...

43:48.900 --> 43:51.900
The tricorder readings Commander
Chakotay took at the shrine

43:51.900 --> 43:53.700
reveaI traces of iridium ions,

43:53.700 --> 43:55.000
which we couId've
known about sooner

43:55.000 --> 43:57.400
if we'd been permitted
to take those readings at first.

43:57.500 --> 43:59.300
And iridium ions
are significant?

43:59.300 --> 44:01.800
They caused a temporary
dieIectric effect

44:01.900 --> 44:03.400
in the outer epidermaI Iayers,

44:03.500 --> 44:05.600
which neutraIized
some of the biogenic energy--

44:05.600 --> 44:08.900
not much, but enough to make the
Captain's aItered biochemistry

44:09.000 --> 44:10.300
an effective defense.

44:10.300 --> 44:11.700
Then how was I cured?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.200
The metaboIic treatment
I administered

44:13.200 --> 44:14.700
protected you
against the fuII impact

44:14.700 --> 44:16.200
of exposure to the fieId

44:16.300 --> 44:18.000
when the Captain
took you through.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.900
That exposure functioned Iike
a naturaI corticaI stimuIator

44:21.900 --> 44:24.700
and reactivated
your synaptic pathways.

44:24.700 --> 44:26.400
That's fascinating, Doctor.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.700
Captain?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
If there's something
about my anaIysis

44:33.700 --> 44:34.800
you disagree with...

44:34.900 --> 44:38.100
It's a perfectIy sound
expIanation, Doctor.

44:38.200 --> 44:42.200
Very... scientific.
