WEBVTT

00:42.500 --> 00:45.378
Idaflor, that's where we'll go.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.589
But Idaflor's not even inhabited.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.258
Which makes it the perfect place
to hide out.

00:50.842 --> 00:55.263
"Hide"? But I've been stuck
on Kamino my whole life.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.390
Can't we explore?

00:57.474 --> 01:00.894
Not right now.
We have to wait for things to settle down.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.979
Well, we won't be doing either.

01:03.063 --> 01:07.233
We don't have enough fuel,
and we are also entirely out of rations.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.611
Without the Republic
to provide us supplies,

01:09.694 --> 01:12.405
we'll have to acquire these necessities
on our own.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.157
Well, we got a bigger problem.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.369
Comm chatter has our ship's signature
on a wanted list.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.828
So we scramble it.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.246
You can do that?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.748
Of course I can do it.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.168
But I need to land in order
to perform those modifications.

01:25.251 --> 01:29.214
By my calculations,
the closest planet is... Pantora.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.342
Well, Pantora it is.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.428
-

01:40.600 --> 01:43.937
Pantora it is.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.511
-

02:17.512 --> 02:21.766
Why'd you tell me we're out of rations?
Now I'm starving.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.602
Our priority is scrambling
the ship's signature key.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.022
Your priority.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.275
Are you fellas here for repairs?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.610
-Just a minor calibration and fuel.
-

02:32.694 --> 02:36.740
Have at it.
Just need to scan your ship in.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.909
Are you sure about that?

02:41.870 --> 02:44.622
I suppose I could skip that step.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.957
Mm-hmm.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.336
-Ah, that was easy.
-

02:49.419 --> 02:52.213
Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.298
Huh?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.843
You-- You said you'd skip the step.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.054
-I could.
-Great!

02:59.137 --> 03:02.015
If I had some incentive...

03:03.767 --> 03:06.644
of the financial variety.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.689
I think he means credits.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.234
Is that sufficient incentive?

03:20.241 --> 03:22.577
Pleasure doing business with you.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.748
We're getting the hang
of this civilian thing.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.965
-This is Raspar Six at Ro station.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.553
Word on the channels is,

03:40.637 --> 03:45.225
you're looking for a certain
modified Omicron-class attack shuttle.

03:45.308 --> 03:50.480
I might know where to find it,
but that information's going to cost you.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.607
I'll make it
well worth your while.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.778
Transmit the coordinates
and make sure they don't leave.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.843
You can't sell that explosive.
It's our last one.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.846
And it's the only thing we have
worth any money.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.140
You wanna eat, don't you?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.392
Why do Tech and I have
to do all the repairs

04:27.475 --> 04:29.811
while you get to go sightseeing?

04:29.894 --> 04:30.895
"Sightseeing"?

04:30.979 --> 04:36.651
No, no. This is a supply run.
In and out, quickly and quietly.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.029
Yeah. And you stick out too much.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.488
Oh, and you don't?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.490
Not dressed like this.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.493
All right. Let's get moving.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.038
-Omega, you're with us.
-Yes.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.000
Hey! Bring back something good to eat.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.912
...registering
for your individual chain code,

05:28.995 --> 05:32.874
every citizen can exchange their
invalid currency for imperial credits...

05:32.957 --> 05:35.210
What are they celebrating?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.544
The end of the war.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.091
Chain code post like on Saleucami.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.009
...your individual chain code,

05:43.093 --> 05:49.683
every citizen can exchange their invalid
currency for Imperial credits at no cost,

05:49.766 --> 05:53.186
thanks to the generosity
of the new Galactic Empire.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.605
Things are changing quicker
than I thought.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.941
Let's get what we came for
and get out of here.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.236
But the war is over. Isn't that good?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.488
Depends which side you're on.

06:03.571 --> 06:08.618
...at no cost, thanks to the
generosity of the new Galactic Empire.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.421
The signature key should be embedded
below the rear parallax inverters.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.631
Just tell me what to rip out.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.175
Well, start with that.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.363
No sale.

06:45.447 --> 06:50.410
Look, this is a pyro denton
worth at least 1,800 credits.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.873
Maybe in the black market,
but I'm running a reputable business here.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.878
Hey, kid! You break it, you buy it.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.046
Sorry.

07:14.726 --> 07:18.313
If you're looking to sell something,
how about your droid?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.397
Droid?

07:19.981 --> 07:23.568
Uh, he's a-- he's a military prototype.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.111
Military, eh?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.031
Hmm.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.491
I'll give you 2,000.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.575
Hmm.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.410
Give me a minute.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.539
No, no, no. You can't be serious.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.291
We need the credits.

07:38.375 --> 07:42.045
Once we get the supplies, I'll give you
the signal and you can leave.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.507
Fine, but not at that price.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.593
-I am worth more than 2,000.
-Right.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.428
Make it 4,000.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.889
Three.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.768
Deal.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.157
Hello, there.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.246
-

08:16.329 --> 08:18.707
Oh. Hey, wait. Wait.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.583
Hey!

08:29.718 --> 08:33.304
Echo, go to your new owner.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.474
Yes, whatever you require.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.896
Omega?

08:44.482 --> 08:45.483
Omega?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.204
Hey! Watch it.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.289
S-- Sorry.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.799
Oh, are you all right?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.515
You seem lost.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.477
I got separated from my friends.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.939
I can help with that.
Not to worry. We'll find them.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.123
We'll finally have some order around here.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.835
Now, get to work
and start supervising these droids.

09:48.797 --> 09:54.344
I beg your pardon. I am the droid
in charge-- Oh, my! You're not a droid.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.518
You're right, Clink.
I will report his deception at once.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
I'll take your complaint.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.022
Dear me!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.816
Anyone else?

10:29.087 --> 10:31.881
Thanks for helping me look for my friends.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.635
It's no trouble at all. You hungry, kid?

10:35.719 --> 10:38.555
Yeah, but I don't have any credits.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.313
Sorry about that.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.243
Thank you. You're so kind.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.120
My mistake.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.623
Here.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.918
But we didn't pay for these.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.713
It's okay to break the rules sometimes.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.506
Are you a soldier?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.800
Not exactly.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.094
Then why do you have a blaster?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.596
To protect myself.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.390
The galaxy's a dangerous place
to be on your own.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.185
Yeah. It's a good thing I have my friends.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.895
Aren't you lucky?

11:28.772 --> 11:33.610
I know. If you're alone,
you should come with us.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.906
Now that's the best offer I've had
in a long time.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.910
Come on. This way.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.624
Omega.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.252
Oh, there's one of my friends now.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.925
Omega, step away from her.

11:57.008 --> 12:00.136
Why? She was helping me look for you.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.765
Yes, Omega and I were getting
to know each other.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.529
Hunter!

12:17.612 --> 12:19.989
Let go!
-

12:29.833 --> 12:31.042
Omega, run!

12:38.758 --> 12:40.218
Citizen.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.512
Halt!

12:45.932 --> 12:47.600
Wrecker, easy with my ship.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.685
Your ship?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.940
There. That is the signature key.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.652
Ah.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.612
Got it.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.072
With a slight adjustment,

13:01.156 --> 13:04.075
we'll be able to scramble our signature
whenever we need to.

13:04.159 --> 13:09.706
Wrecker, Tech, Echo.
I lost Omega. Somebody attacked us.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.833
Somebody who?

13:11.916 --> 13:15.837
A woman. Highly trained.
She's after the kid.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.756
Yeah, we'll see about that.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.551
I'll tap
into the central security network.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.054
There should be enough cameras
in this city to find her.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.891
Listen, I made a bit of noise
out here. Get the ship ready to go.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.643
Well, it's not technically a ship
at the moment.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.397
And unless you have a team of maintenance
droids, it's going to be a while.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.607
I can help with that.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.859
Gear up, fellas,
we're going into the field.

13:39.027 --> 13:43.198
I am afraid that is impossible.
We are prohibited from leaving this post.

13:43.281 --> 13:47.952
Look, the sooner we do this,
the sooner you're back in charge.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.915
Even so, I'm not capable
of removing our restraining bolts.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.918
That's why I'm the supervisor.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.881
-

13:59.964 --> 14:04.010
Hey! Where do you think you're all going?
Get back inside.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.429
You're not a droid.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.473
You got me for a bargain.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.852
Hey!

14:13.770 --> 14:15.021
- Watch it!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.962
Be advised,
a public disturbance has been reported

14:39.045 --> 14:40.296
in the central marketplace.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.718
We have a 315 in progress.
Two suspects on foot.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.803
All available units to respond.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.346
I have eyes on Omega.

14:48.430 --> 14:52.767
She went down into the maintenance
tunnels. Head northwest, at 155.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
And she's got company.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.871
-There you are.
-

15:12.954 --> 15:14.205
Wrecker?

15:14.289 --> 15:15.749
You had us worried.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.001
Can we get out of here?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.502
You got it.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.840
I'm with Omega. We're on our way.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.930
-Get to the ship. I'll handle her.
-

15:36.936 --> 15:41.608
You mess with the kid,
you mess with me.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.643
Tech wasn't kidding.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.853
We got our work cut out for us.

16:18.937 --> 16:22.399
I am not programmed to repair
or assemble starships. Oh!

16:24.901 --> 16:28.279
No, you don't, Clink.
I give the orders around here.

16:28.363 --> 16:32.033
225, DK-3, get to work on the repulsors.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.337
Wrecker, where are you?

16:44.421 --> 16:46.006
Wrecker. Do you copy?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.427
Reports of a child hanging
from a tower in the lower division.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.678
I do not see Wrecker,

16:51.761 --> 16:55.140
but Omega is hanging
from a maintenance tower in the skyway.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.391
Hanging?

16:56.474 --> 16:58.184
For now. I suggest you hurry.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.400
Hey!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.326
-

17:16.661 --> 17:18.830
You can thank me later.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.090
-Tuck and roll when you land, kid.
-

17:38.224 --> 17:40.685
Wrecker.
-

17:40.769 --> 17:42.312
I gotta find Omega.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.981
Hunter's already on it.
Get back to the ship.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.129
Hunter!

18:50.880 --> 18:51.923
Look out!

19:34.257 --> 19:36.509
-Hold on, kid. We're not out of this yet.
-

19:40.972 --> 19:43.099
-

20:07.290 --> 20:08.291
Huh?

20:10.377 --> 20:13.630
I'm missing all the action.

20:15.256 --> 20:19.135
My diagnostic test indicates this vessel
is now operational.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.428
Thanks for the help, boys.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.890
They're all yours.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.018
You heard him.
I am back in charge. Follow me.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.114
We need to go. Now.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.117
Wrecker, pick up the pace.
We don't have all day.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.036
I'm here.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.250
-

20:52.252 --> 20:53.962
No. They can't leave!

20:54.045 --> 20:59.384
No. Wait! Don't go!
She hasn't paid me yet! Stop!

21:18.028 --> 21:21.114
She has to be a bounty hunter.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.742
A what?

21:23.825 --> 21:26.244
Someone hired to retrieve targets.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.288
And you appear to be the target.

21:28.872 --> 21:29.873
Me?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.125
Hey, don't scare the kid.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.086
We have to find out who she is
and who hired her.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.477
No. Wait. I-- I tried to stop them.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.488
If they come back,
you know how to contact me.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.208
-The target got away, but I'll find her.
