00:49.682 --> 00:51.809
Anything goes

00:59.893 --> 01:02.259
Anything goes

01:20.647 --> 01:24.105
Anything goes.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.295
Anything goes.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.448
Be careful.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.636
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.643
Only on special occasions.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.737
So, it is true?

03:34.814 --> 03:36.748
You found Nurhachi?

03:36.816 --> 03:38.283
You know I did.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.946
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

03:42.088 --> 03:44.056
without paying for him.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.590
You have insulted my son.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.751
No, you have insulted me.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.226
I spared his life.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.026
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.393
This is Willie Scott.

03:58.471 --> 04:03.238
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archaeologist.

04:03.309 --> 04:06.210
Well, I thought archaeologists
were always funny little men

04:06.279 --> 04:08.907
searching for their mommies.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.210
Mummies.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.911
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,

04:13.019 --> 04:15.510
and he's going to deliver him...

04:15.588 --> 04:16.646
now.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.652
Say, who is the Nurhac...

04:19.726 --> 04:20.920
...hachi?!

04:21.027 --> 04:22.790
Put the gun away, sonny.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.396
I suggest you give me
what you owe me

04:29.469 --> 04:30.731
or anything goes.

04:30.803 --> 04:31.735
Ooh.

04:41.514 --> 04:42.811
Open it.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.822
The diamond, Lao.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.552
The deal was for the diamond.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.579
Oh, Lao...

05:18.651 --> 05:20.175
Ow!

05:21.587 --> 05:23.919
To your very good health.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.355
Lao!

05:25.425 --> 05:26.392
He put a hole...

05:26.459 --> 05:29.826
he put two holes in my dress
from Paris!

05:29.896 --> 05:31.193
Sit down!

05:34.634 --> 05:39.196
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.705
My pleasure.

05:40.773 --> 05:44.470
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

05:47.847 --> 05:49.337
Here he is.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.286
This Nurhachi's
a real small guy.

05:58.324 --> 06:02.886
Inside are the remains
of Nurhachi...

06:02.962 --> 06:07.126
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.465
Welcome home, old boy.

06:18.444 --> 06:22.904
And now, you give me
the diamond.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.576
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

06:25.651 --> 06:27.619
or am I going deaf?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.352
What's that?

06:34.427 --> 06:36.361
Antidote.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.397
To what?

06:38.464 --> 06:42.195
The poison you just drank,
Dr. Jones.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.698
The poison works fast,
Dr. Jones.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.949
-Lao.
-Lao!

07:00.019 --> 07:01.884
You keep the girl.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.147
I find another.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.519
Good service here.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.856
That's not a waiter.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.193
Wu Han's an old friend.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.256
Game's not over, Lao.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.062
Antidote.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.151
Indy...

07:35.822 --> 07:38.256
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.485
Not this time, Indy.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.326
I followed you
on many adventures...

07:44.397 --> 07:46.763
but into the great
unknown mystery...

07:46.833 --> 07:48.801
I go first, Indy.

07:52.171 --> 07:55.334
Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.706
You will soon be joining him.

08:02.915 --> 08:06.214
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?

08:57.970 --> 08:59.301
Oh, nuts!

09:05.111 --> 09:06.203
Oh!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.140
The antidote.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.308
Where's the diamond?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.871
No!

09:47.019 --> 09:48.350
Stay there!

10:29.795 --> 10:31.285
Come on.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.433
I don't want to die!

10:46.145 --> 10:48.204
Who are you?

10:51.817 --> 10:54.285
Wow! Holy smoke!

10:54.353 --> 10:56.446
Crash landing!

10:56.522 --> 10:59.491
Short Round, step on it.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.025
Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.856
Hold on to your potatoes.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.021
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

11:20.413 --> 11:21.675
Wow!

11:21.747 --> 11:22.839
Wow.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.176
Where's the antidote?
Let me have it.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.948
Listen, I just met you,
for Christ's sakes.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.454
Give me...

11:30.523 --> 11:31.820
Oh, I'm not that kind of girl.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.382
Hey, Dr. Jones,
no time for love.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.950
We got company.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.293
Oh, I hope you choke.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.231
No shooting.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.155
Okay, you asked for it.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.544
This is fun!

12:29.081 --> 12:31.140
Here, hold this.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.789
Where's my gun?

12:37.857 --> 12:38.949
Where's my gun?!

12:39.024 --> 12:42.323
I burnt my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

12:51.470 --> 12:52.960
Ah, Dr. Jones...

12:53.038 --> 12:53.970
I'm Art Weber.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.529
I spoke with your assistant.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.542
Uh, we've managed
to secure three seats,

12:57.610 --> 12:59.703
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

12:59.779 --> 13:03.078
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.309
Is he kidding?

13:04.383 --> 13:07.477
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.111
Heavens, aren't you
Willie Scott,

13:09.188 --> 13:11.247
the famous American
female vocalist?

13:13.159 --> 13:14.786
Owe you a gin.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.931
Nice try, Lao Che.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.507
Good-bye, Dr. Jones.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.713
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

14:13.786 --> 14:16.186
I'm allowing you to tag along,

14:16.255 --> 14:19.588
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

14:19.658 --> 14:21.751
Okay, doll?

14:21.827 --> 14:23.624
What do you mean, ''tag along''?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.561
Ever since
you got into my club,

14:25.631 --> 14:27.565
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.533
Oh, yeah?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.821
Oh, no...

16:06.899 --> 16:08.332
Oh, no!

16:08.400 --> 16:10.163
Mister, mister...

16:10.235 --> 16:11.793
Oh, mister, wake up.
Please, mister...

16:11.870 --> 16:13.895
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!

16:14.006 --> 16:15.906
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.465
Oh, wake up, please!

16:17.543 --> 16:18.635
Are we there already?

16:18.711 --> 16:19.643
Oh, good.

16:19.712 --> 16:20.679
No.

16:20.746 --> 16:21.713
Huh?

16:23.515 --> 16:25.346
No one's flying the plane!

16:25.417 --> 16:26.509
Oh, boy...

16:28.087 --> 16:29.349
They've all gone!

16:33.192 --> 16:35.353
You know how to fly,
don't you?

16:35.427 --> 16:37.588
No. Do you?

16:37.663 --> 16:38.595
Oh, no.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.131
-Oh, my God!
-How hard can it be?

16:40.199 --> 16:41.188
-I'm gonna faint.
-Altimeter!

16:41.266 --> 16:42.460
Okay.

16:42.534 --> 16:43.762
Air speed.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.928
Uh, okay.

16:45.037 --> 16:45.935
Fuel...

16:46.905 --> 16:47.872
Fuel?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.001
Fuel?!

17:04.423 --> 17:06.152
I think we got a big problem.

17:06.224 --> 17:07.692
Dr. Jones!
Shorty!

17:07.760 --> 17:10.694
Dr. Jones!
No more parachutes!

17:12.297 --> 17:13.730
-Oh...
-Shorty!

17:13.799 --> 17:15.060
-Come on, give me a hand!
-What's that?

17:15.134 --> 17:16.567
Move the box!

17:16.635 --> 17:18.465
Dr. Jones, you're crazy!

17:23.208 --> 17:24.835
Shorty, get our stuff!

17:29.481 --> 17:30.470
A boat?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.744
We're not sinking.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.807
We're crashing!

17:34.953 --> 17:36.887
Grab on, Shorty!

17:36.955 --> 17:37.887
Grab on!

17:37.956 --> 17:39.685
-Lady, I can't breathe!
-Tight!

18:19.598 --> 18:20.792
Slow it down!

18:22.668 --> 18:23.930
That wasn't so bad, was it?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.918
Aah! Put on the brakes!

18:43.889 --> 18:48.258
I hate the water,
and I hate being wet,

18:48.327 --> 18:49.385
and I hate you!

18:49.461 --> 18:51.122
Good.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.527
Good!

19:17.789 --> 19:20.019
Dr. Jones?

19:20.092 --> 19:21.889
I'm all right, Shorty.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.289
You okay?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.795
Oh, where are we, anyway?

19:39.678 --> 19:40.770
India.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.336
How do you know that?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.792
Oh, I sure hope
this means dinner.

21:36.862 --> 21:37.988
God, I'm starving.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.494
Thank you.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.266
I can't eat this.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.411
That's more food than these
people eat in a week.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.503
They're starving.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.912
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can have...

21:57.983 --> 22:00.247
Eat it.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.019
I'm not hungry.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.791
You're insulting them,

22:06.858 --> 22:09.224
and you're embarrassing me.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.694
Eat it.
Eat it.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.128
Eat.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.837
Bad news coming.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.777
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

22:33.852 --> 22:34.784
I'm a professor.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.878
I have to get back
to my university.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.219
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

22:41.927 --> 22:47.160
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

22:47.232 --> 22:50.360
Pankot is not
on the way to Delhi.

22:50.435 --> 22:52.699
You will go to Pankot Palace.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.466
I thought the palace
had been deserted

22:54.539 --> 22:56.200
since, uh... the 1850s.

22:56.274 --> 22:58.936
No. Now there is
a new maharaja,

22:59.010 --> 23:04.038
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

23:04.116 --> 23:08.109
It is that place
kill my people.

23:08.186 --> 23:09.778
What has happened here?

23:09.855 --> 23:12.756
The evil start in Pankot...

23:12.824 --> 23:16.885
then like monsoon...

23:16.962 --> 23:21.592
it moves darkness...

23:21.666 --> 23:24.794
over all country...

23:24.870 --> 23:27.395
over all country.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.269
The evil?

23:32.344 --> 23:33.436
What evil?

23:33.512 --> 23:34.945
See? Bad news.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.447
You listen to Suwamu.
You leave Lanka.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.450
Shh...

23:41.253 --> 23:44.654
They came from palace...

23:44.723 --> 23:47.453
and took Sivalinga...

23:47.526 --> 23:49.790
from our village.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.294
Took what?

23:51.363 --> 23:52.557
It's a stone--

23:52.631 --> 23:55.225
a sacred stone from the shrine
that protects the village.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.098
It is why Siva brought you here.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.913
We weren't brought here.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.245
Our plane crashed.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.046
It crashed.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.451
No, no.

24:16.521 --> 24:21.618
We prayed to Siva
to help us find the stone.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.718
It was Siva

24:23.795 --> 24:28.926
who made you fall
from the sky.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.771
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivilinga and bring back

24:36.842 --> 24:38.275
to us.

24:38.343 --> 24:42.780
Bring back to us.
Bring back to us.

24:42.848 --> 24:45.078
Bring back to us.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.142
Dr. Jones, did they
make the plane crash

24:48.220 --> 24:50.552
to get you here?

24:50.622 --> 24:52.214
No, Shorty,
it's just a ghost story.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.814
Don't worry about it.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.428
They took the stone from here.

25:05.437 --> 25:09.771
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.138
Yes.

25:11.209 --> 25:12.335
With three lines across it

25:12.410 --> 25:14.344
representing the three levels
of the universe.

25:14.412 --> 25:16.175
That's right.
Yes.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.081
I've seen stones
like the one you lost.

25:19.150 --> 25:23.177
But why would Maharaja
take the sacred stone from here?

25:23.255 --> 25:27.692
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

25:27.759 --> 25:31.354
We says we will not.

25:31.429 --> 25:32.555
Excuse me,

25:32.631 --> 25:35.259
I don't understand how one rock
could destroy a whole village.

25:39.838 --> 25:42.272
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

25:42.340 --> 25:43.398
the village wells dried up,

25:43.475 --> 25:44.965
and the river turned to sand.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.615
The crops were swallowed
by the earth,

25:51.683 --> 25:55.210
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.654
Then one night there
was a fire in the fields.

25:58.723 --> 26:02.022
The men went out
to fight the fire.

26:02.093 --> 26:05.324
When they came back, the women
were crying in the darkness.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.635
Children.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.736
He says
they stole their children.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.527
Sankara! Sankara...

27:16.768 --> 27:18.827
Ranjit!

27:19.938 --> 27:21.098
Ranjit!

27:47.098 --> 27:49.066
Sankara.

28:03.915 --> 28:08.750
Little boy escaped
from the evil palace.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.516
Many other children
still there.

28:11.589 --> 28:14.854
What we do, Dr. Jones?

28:21.566 --> 28:24.160
What you think?

28:24.235 --> 28:26.396
I think that somebody believes

28:26.471 --> 28:29.235
the good luck rock
from this village

28:29.307 --> 28:31.832
is one of the lost
Sankara stones.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.674
What is Sankara?

28:34.746 --> 28:36.907
Fortune and glory, kid.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.648
Fortune and glory.

29:04.109 --> 29:07.135
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.315
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

29:18.389 --> 29:20.721
I can't go to Delhi like this!

29:20.792 --> 29:22.316
We're not going to Delhi, doll.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.725
We're going to Pankot Palace.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.821
Pankot?!

29:26.898 --> 29:29.025
I can't go to Pankot!
I'm a singer.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.624
Oh, I need to call my agent.

29:30.702 --> 29:31.726
Is there a phone?

29:31.803 --> 29:33.270
Anybody, I need a phone!

30:08.940 --> 30:09.998
Eww!

30:23.922 --> 30:27.187
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

30:27.258 --> 30:31.490
You come to America with me,
and we get job in circus.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.497
You like that?
You like America?

30:33.565 --> 30:35.260
You're my best friend.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.460
You're my best friend.

30:37.535 --> 30:40.971
Ooh, what big birds!

30:41.105 --> 30:44.370
Those aren't big
birds, sweetheart.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.411
They're giant vampire bats.

30:47.478 --> 30:48.877
Bats?

30:57.388 --> 31:00.255
Oh, pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

31:00.325 --> 31:01.724
You know what you really need?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.057
You really need a bath.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.868
Ha-ha, very funny.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.305
Very funny.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.166
Very funny.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.236
All wet.

31:22.313 --> 31:26.079
I was happy in Shanghai.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.813
I had a little house...
and a garden.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.180
My friends were rich.

31:32.257 --> 31:35.488
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.188
I hate being outside!

31:39.864 --> 31:41.388
I'm a singer!

31:41.466 --> 31:43.934
I could lose my voice!

31:45.370 --> 31:47.930
I think
we'll camp here tonight.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.500
Cut it out.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.307
What do you got?

31:58.383 --> 31:59.372
Two sixes.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.747
Aha-ha, three aces.

32:00.818 --> 32:01.910
I win.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.920
Two more game,
I have all your money.

32:03.988 --> 32:05.114
Ha, ha, ha!

32:06.691 --> 32:09.558
It's poker, Shorty,
anything can happen.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.562
Where did you find your,
uh, little bodyguard?

32:12.630 --> 32:15.121
I didn't find him,
I caught him.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.393
What?

32:16.467 --> 32:17.695
Shorty's family were killed

32:17.769 --> 32:19.532
when the Japanese
bombed Shanghai.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.834
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

32:21.906 --> 32:25.205
I caught him trying to pick my
pocket, didn't I, short stuff?

32:28.780 --> 32:31.078
Biggest trouble with her
is the noise.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.957
Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.117
You cheat!

32:42.193 --> 32:43.751
What do you mean?
You take four card.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.730
-You pay now.
-Oh, they were stuck together.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.731
No stuck. No mistake.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.097
They were stuck together.
It's a mistake.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.227
I'm very little.
You cheat very big.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.335
Dr. Jones, you cheat!

32:55.406 --> 32:57.237
You pay money.
You owe me ten cent.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.970
Look at this.
Look at this.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.180
You accuse me of cheating.

33:04.248 --> 33:06.079
You're cheating.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.884
You make me poor.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.254
No fun.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.587
Play with you no fun.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.720
-I quit.
-I quit, too.

33:18.796 --> 33:21.026
Oh, this place is
completely surrounded.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.294
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.427
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.902
Oh, my God,
what else is out there?

33:26.971 --> 33:27.938
Willie, wait...

33:28.072 --> 33:29.164
Oh!

33:33.478 --> 33:35.537
Willie, Willie...

33:35.613 --> 33:36.637
What is that?

33:36.714 --> 33:38.944
Is that short for something?

33:39.083 --> 33:42.644
''Willie'' is my
professional name, Indiana.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.484
Hey, lady,
you call him Dr. Jones.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.184
My professional name.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.954
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.497
Fortune and glory?

33:53.564 --> 33:54.997
Fortune and glory.

33:56.534 --> 34:00.766
Well... this is a piece
of an old manuscript.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.568
This pictograph
represents Sankara,

34:03.641 --> 34:04.903
a priest.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.910
Scram.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.411
Gentle. Gentle.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.911
This is hundreds of years old.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.539
Is that some kind of writing?

34:11.616 --> 34:13.413
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

34:13.484 --> 34:14.473
Cut it out.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.112
It's part
of the legend of Sankara.

34:17.188 --> 34:18.212
He climbs Mount Kalisa

34:18.289 --> 34:20.018
where he meets Siva,
the Hindu god.

34:20.091 --> 34:21.683
That's Siva?

34:21.759 --> 34:23.818
And what's he handing
the priest?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.623
Rocks.

34:25.696 --> 34:26.924
Stop.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.558
He told him to go
forth and combat evil.

34:29.634 --> 34:30.793
And to help him, he gave him

34:30.868 --> 34:33.928
five sacred stones
with magical properties.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.699
Magic rocks?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.297
My grandpa was a magician.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.536
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

34:39.610 --> 34:40.940
and pigeons up his sleeves.

34:41.012 --> 34:44.106
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

34:44.181 --> 34:47.049
Magic rocks.
Fortune and glory.

34:47.118 --> 34:48.779
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.545
Where are you going?

34:51.621 --> 34:54.887
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.654
For safety's sake.

34:56.726 --> 35:00.424
Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.759
I said, cut it out!

35:07.972 --> 35:11.703
I hate that elephant.

35:39.036 --> 35:40.594
Indy, look!

35:40.671 --> 35:43.265
I see it, Shorty.

35:43.341 --> 35:46.333
That's it: Pankot Palace.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.083
Dr. Jones, what you look at?

37:06.157 --> 37:08.990
Don't come up here.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.724
No! No, no, no, no!

37:16.801 --> 37:18.029
Don't leave! No!

37:18.102 --> 37:19.899
No, no, no, no, no!

37:19.971 --> 37:22.565
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

37:22.640 --> 37:24.369
Oh, no! Indy!

37:24.442 --> 37:26.740
They're stealing our rides!

37:26.811 --> 37:29.871
We walk from here.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.010
Hello.

38:07.084 --> 38:10.019
I should say
you look rather lost.

38:10.087 --> 38:11.520
But then I cannot imagine

38:11.589 --> 38:14.854
where in the world the three
of you would look at home.

38:14.925 --> 38:15.857
We're not lost.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.587
We're on our way to Delhi.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.459
This is Miss Scott.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.657
This is Mr. Round.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.222
Short Round.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.859
My name is Indiana Jones.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.496
Dr. Jones, the eminent
archaeologist?

38:28.572 --> 38:30.164
Hard to believe, isn't it?

38:30.241 --> 38:31.173
Ah.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.107
I remember first
hearing your name

38:33.177 --> 38:34.508
when I was up at Oxford.

38:34.578 --> 38:35.510
Oh.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.479
I'm Chattar Lal, Prime Minister

38:37.548 --> 38:40.244
to His Highness,
the Maharaja of Pankot.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.115
I'm enchanted.

38:42.186 --> 38:44.120
Enchanted.
Thank you very much.

38:44.188 --> 38:45.450
Thank you very much.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.650
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.193
Enchanted, huh?

39:04.008 --> 39:06.943
Shorty, where's my razor?

39:31.302 --> 39:32.735
We are fortunate tonight

39:32.803 --> 39:35.499
to have so many
unexpected visitors.

39:35.573 --> 39:36.767
This is Captain...

39:36.841 --> 39:39.139
...Blumburtt.
11th Poona Rifles.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.179
And you, sir, are
Dr. Jones, I presume.

39:42.246 --> 39:43.907
I am, Captain.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.608
Captain Blumburtt and his troops

39:45.683 --> 39:47.412
are on a routine
inspection tour.

39:47.485 --> 39:48.918
The British find it amusing

39:48.986 --> 39:50.920
to inspect us
at their convenience.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.250
I do hope, sir,

39:52.323 --> 39:56.123
that it's not, uh,
inconvenient to you, uh... sir.

39:56.193 --> 39:59.924
The British worry so
about their empire.

39:59.997 --> 40:02.966
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

40:11.842 --> 40:13.104
Ah...

40:13.177 --> 40:15.475
you look beautiful.

40:15.546 --> 40:18.106
I think the maharaja
is swimming in loot.

40:18.182 --> 40:21.447
Maybe it wasn't such a bad
idea coming here after all.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.851
You look like a princess.

40:23.921 --> 40:28.381
Mr. Lal, what do they call
the maharaja's wife?

40:28.459 --> 40:30.859
His Highness
has not yet taken a wife.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.520
How interesting.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.656
Well, uh, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.973
His Supreme Highness,

40:52.049 --> 40:56.315
guardian of Pankot tradition,

40:56.387 --> 40:59.652
the Maharaja of Pankot,

40:59.723 --> 41:02.385
Zalim Singh.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.941
That's the maharaja?

41:26.016 --> 41:27.608
A kid?!

41:29.887 --> 41:33.152
Maybe he like older women.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.696
Captain Blumburtt
was just telling me

41:42.766 --> 41:45.394
something of the interesting
history of the palace--

41:45.469 --> 41:47.437
the importance it played
in the mutiny.

41:47.505 --> 41:52.169
It seems the British never
forget the Mutiny of 1857.

41:53.377 --> 41:55.971
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events--

41:56.080 --> 41:57.980
before the mutiny,
going back a century,

41:58.115 --> 42:00.811
back to the time of Clive--
that are more interesting.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.683
And what events are those,
Dr. Jones?

42:03.754 --> 42:05.585
Well, if memory
serves me correctly,

42:05.656 --> 42:07.089
this area, this province,

42:07.157 --> 42:09.387
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.257
Ah!

42:11.328 --> 42:14.923
Snake... Surprise.

42:15.065 --> 42:16.794
What's the surprise?

42:26.277 --> 42:29.337
Dr. Jones,
you know perfectly well

42:29.413 --> 42:32.382
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

42:32.449 --> 42:33.507
Yes, of course.

42:33.584 --> 42:37.520
The Thuggee was an obscenity
that worshipped Kali

42:37.588 --> 42:39.112
with human sacrifices.

42:39.189 --> 42:42.420
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

42:45.429 --> 42:49.160
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.599
There are no stories anymore.

42:51.669 --> 42:53.830
I'm not so sure.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.963
We came from a small village.

42:56.106 --> 42:57.869
The peasants there told us

42:57.942 --> 43:00.672
Pankot Palace
was growing powerful again

43:00.744 --> 43:02.769
because of some ancient evil.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.905
Village stories, Dr. Jones.

43:04.982 --> 43:08.748
They're just fear and folklore.

43:08.819 --> 43:12.118
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

43:12.189 --> 43:15.818
I'm not worried,
Mr. Prime Minister, just, uh...

43:15.893 --> 43:18.384
just, um, interested.

43:20.965 --> 43:21.989
Ah...

43:33.877 --> 43:36.812
What? You are not eating?

43:36.880 --> 43:40.611
I had bugs for lunch.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.886
Give me your hat.

43:47.224 --> 43:48.748
Why?

43:48.826 --> 43:51.090
'Cause I'm gonna
puke in it. Oh!

43:53.130 --> 43:55.155
You know,
the villagers also told us

43:55.232 --> 43:57.166
Pankot Palace
had taken something.

43:57.234 --> 44:00.067
Dr. Jones, in our country,

44:00.137 --> 44:03.595
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

44:03.674 --> 44:06.404
I'm sorry.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.911
I thought we were talking
about folklore.

44:09.013 --> 44:14.576
Excuse me, sir, do you have
anything simple, like soup?

44:14.652 --> 44:17.883
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

44:17.955 --> 44:20.355
A sacred rock.

44:22.059 --> 44:23.321
Ha!

44:23.394 --> 44:26.022
You see, Captain, a rock!

44:27.564 --> 44:29.464
Ah!

44:33.837 --> 44:35.031
Ah...

44:39.977 --> 44:43.276
Something connected--

44:43.347 --> 44:45.281
the villagers' rock

44:45.349 --> 44:48.648
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

44:48.719 --> 44:52.678
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

44:52.756 --> 44:54.747
I seem to remember
that in Honduras

44:54.825 --> 44:57.157
you were accused
of being a grave robber

44:57.227 --> 44:58.922
rather than an archaeologist.

44:58.996 --> 45:02.432
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

45:02.499 --> 45:04.160
And wasn't it
the Sultan of Madagascar

45:04.234 --> 45:05.758
who threatened
to cut your head off

45:05.836 --> 45:07.326
if you ever returned
to his country?

45:07.404 --> 45:08.371
No, it wasn't my head.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.736
Then your hands, perhaps.

45:09.807 --> 45:12.071
No, it wasn't my hands,

45:12.142 --> 45:14.076
it was my...

45:14.144 --> 45:15.577
my misunderstanding.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.773
Exactly what we have
here, Dr. Jones.

45:17.848 --> 45:21.909
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

45:21.985 --> 45:25.421
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

45:25.489 --> 45:28.686
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

45:28.759 --> 45:31.819
and did of unspeakable things.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.797
I am ashamed of what happened
here so many years ago,

45:35.866 --> 45:37.060
and I assure you

45:37.134 --> 45:41.195
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

45:41.271 --> 45:44.729
If I offended you...

45:44.808 --> 45:47.276
then I am sorry.

45:56.386 --> 45:58.513
Ah, dessert!

46:12.102 --> 46:14.969
Chilled monkey brains.

46:29.219 --> 46:31.949
Uh, I think I'll
just check on Willie.

46:33.290 --> 46:35.417
That's all you better do.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.226
Tell me later what happened.

46:39.296 --> 46:41.560
Am-scray.

46:50.107 --> 46:51.768
Ah.

46:51.842 --> 46:54.072
I've got something for you.

46:54.144 --> 46:57.739
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.215
Right.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.381
Oh.

47:07.457 --> 47:10.324
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

47:10.394 --> 47:12.385
Mmm.

47:12.462 --> 47:14.327
Oh, you're a very nice man.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.026
Maybe you could be
my palace slave.

47:27.110 --> 47:29.169
Wear your jewels to bed,
Princess?

47:29.246 --> 47:32.215
Yeah.

47:32.282 --> 47:35.115
And nothing else.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.914
That shock you?

47:36.987 --> 47:39.046
Nothing shocks me.

47:39.122 --> 47:41.613
I'm a scientist.

47:41.692 --> 47:45.389
So, as a scientist, you
do a lot of research?

47:45.462 --> 47:47.862
Always.

47:47.931 --> 47:50.399
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

47:53.470 --> 47:55.461
Nocturnal activities.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.531
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

47:58.609 --> 48:00.338
what position
I like to sleep in?

48:00.410 --> 48:01.877
Mating customs.

48:01.945 --> 48:03.003
Love rituals?

48:03.080 --> 48:05.674
Primitive sexual practices.

48:05.749 --> 48:07.842
So you're an authority
in that area?

48:07.918 --> 48:09.545
Years of fieldwork.

48:09.620 --> 48:10.882
Oh.

48:18.562 --> 48:21.759
I don't blame you
for being sore at me.

48:21.832 --> 48:25.165
I can be hard to handle.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.169
I've had worse.

48:27.237 --> 48:30.297
But you'll never have better.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.343
I don't know.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.777
As a scientist, I don't want
to prejudice my experiment.

48:36.847 --> 48:39.407
I'll let you know
in the morning.

48:39.483 --> 48:42.316
Why, you conceited ape.

48:42.386 --> 48:45.412
I'm not that easy.

48:45.489 --> 48:48.652
I'm not that easy, either.

48:48.725 --> 48:50.124
Trouble with you is, Willie,

48:50.193 --> 48:52.889
you're too used
to getting your own way.

48:52.963 --> 48:54.931
And you're just
too proud to admit

48:55.032 --> 48:58.126
that you're crazy about me,
Dr. Jones.

48:58.201 --> 49:01.762
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

49:01.838 --> 49:03.328
Five minutes.

49:03.407 --> 49:05.875
You'll be back over here
in five minutes.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.467
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

49:07.544 --> 49:08.670
Five.

49:08.745 --> 49:10.975
You know it, and I know it.

49:26.330 --> 49:28.321
Five minutes.

49:30.334 --> 49:32.165
Four and a half.

50:25.789 --> 50:26.983
''Palace slave.''

50:28.225 --> 50:31.194
''Nocturnal activities.''

50:31.261 --> 50:33.491
I'm a ''conceited ape''?

50:34.698 --> 50:36.393
''I'll tell you in the morning.''

50:38.268 --> 50:39.963
I can't believe it.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.867
He's not coming.

50:41.938 --> 50:42.039
She's not coming.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.007
She's not coming.

50:45.842 --> 50:47.537
I can't believe I'm not going.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.225
Indiana Jones!

51:09.299 --> 51:12.063
This is one night
you'll never forget!

51:12.135 --> 51:13.067
This is the night

51:13.136 --> 51:15.195
I slipped right through
your fingers!

51:17.274 --> 51:18.764
Sleep tight...

51:18.842 --> 51:20.400
and pleasant dreams!

51:21.845 --> 51:26.009
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

51:36.593 --> 51:37.685
Dr. Jones, your whip!

51:59.583 --> 52:00.311
-Shorty...
-Huh?

52:00.383 --> 52:01.475
turn off the switch.

52:07.324 --> 52:09.292
Oh, Indy.

52:10.227 --> 52:11.626
Oh, be gentle with me.

52:11.695 --> 52:12.855
Be gentle with me.

52:19.336 --> 52:21.065
But I'm here.

52:32.949 --> 52:33.938
There's nobody here.

52:34.017 --> 52:36.952
No, I'm here.

52:37.053 --> 52:40.682
Indy, you're acting
awfully strange.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.579
Hey, I'm right here.

53:20.764 --> 53:25.428
''Follow in the footsteps
of Siva.''

53:25.502 --> 53:27.697
What does that mean?

53:29.839 --> 53:33.741
''Do not betray these truths.''

53:33.810 --> 53:36.370
Shorty, go get our stuff.

54:05.308 --> 54:07.742
Stay behind me, Short Round.

54:07.811 --> 54:12.510
Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.

54:24.628 --> 54:26.323
I step where you step.

54:26.396 --> 54:29.160
I touch nothing.

54:29.232 --> 54:31.325
Indy!

54:52.255 --> 54:54.746
I step on something.

54:54.824 --> 54:57.349
Yeah, there's something
on the ground.

54:57.427 --> 54:59.554
Feel like step
on fortune cookies.

55:01.097 --> 55:02.860
It's not fortune cookies.

55:05.101 --> 55:06.466
Let me take a look.

55:20.517 --> 55:22.348
That's no cookies.

55:22.419 --> 55:23.784
It's all right.
I got him.

55:27.757 --> 55:28.246
Ow!

55:28.325 --> 55:29.917
Go. There, go.

56:09.999 --> 56:11.057
Stop.

56:11.134 --> 56:13.398
Look, just stand up
against the wall,

56:13.470 --> 56:14.937
will you?

56:29.386 --> 56:31.411
You say to stand
against the wall!

56:31.488 --> 56:32.716
I listen to what you say!

56:32.789 --> 56:33.517
Not my fault! Not my fault!

56:33.590 --> 56:35.251
Willie, get down here!

56:35.325 --> 56:37.088
We're in trouble!

56:37.160 --> 56:40.561
Willie!
Willie!

56:40.630 --> 56:43.155
Bet I get all dirty again.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.791
-Willie, get down here!
-Not my fault!

56:44.868 --> 56:45.926
We're in trouble!

56:46.002 --> 56:46.934
Trouble?

56:47.003 --> 56:47.935
Trouble?

56:48.037 --> 56:49.402
What sort of...?

57:04.354 --> 57:06.379
This is serious!

57:06.456 --> 57:10.017
There are two dead people
down here!

57:10.093 --> 57:12.084
There're going to be
two dead people in here!

57:12.162 --> 57:13.129
Hurry!

57:13.196 --> 57:15.460
I've almost had enough
of you two.

57:15.532 --> 57:16.726
Willie!

57:16.800 --> 57:18.563
What's the rush?!

57:18.635 --> 57:19.897
It's a long story, Willie.

57:20.003 --> 57:21.868
Hurry, or you don't get
to hear it.

57:23.106 --> 57:26.803
Ooh, God, what is this?

57:28.044 --> 57:30.205
Indy, what is this?

57:30.280 --> 57:31.406
I can't see a thing!

57:32.782 --> 57:34.443
Hurry!

57:34.517 --> 57:36.678
All right!

57:36.753 --> 57:37.811
Oh, I broke a nail.

57:44.527 --> 57:49.294
Uh... Uh...

57:51.968 --> 57:53.833
Willie, hurry!

57:53.903 --> 57:55.928
They're in my hair!

57:56.005 --> 57:57.734
Aw, shut up, Willie!

57:59.909 --> 58:00.637
Indy, let me in!

58:00.710 --> 58:01.574
No, let us out!

58:01.644 --> 58:02.804
Let me in!

58:02.879 --> 58:03.641
Let us out!

58:03.713 --> 58:04.611
Shut up!

58:04.681 --> 58:06.842
I'm down here!
They're all over me!

58:06.916 --> 58:10.352
There's got to be a fulcrum
release lever somewhere.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.409
What?!

58:11.488 --> 58:13.479
A handle that opens the door.

58:13.556 --> 58:14.648
-Go on!

58:14.724 --> 58:15.986
-They're just,
just square holes!

58:16.059 --> 58:16.991
Go to the right hole.

58:17.060 --> 58:19.358
Hurry, Willie!

58:21.164 --> 58:22.324
Ooh...

58:26.569 --> 58:27.536
The other one!

58:27.604 --> 58:29.765
The other right.
Your other right!

58:29.839 --> 58:30.737
The one on your right!

58:30.807 --> 58:32.035
Oh, there's slime inside!

58:32.108 --> 58:34.042
I can't do it.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.099
You can do it.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.202
Feel inside.

58:36.279 --> 58:37.541
Okay.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.314
You feel inside!

58:42.385 --> 58:44.285
Do it now!

58:44.354 --> 58:45.651
Okay!

58:49.392 --> 58:51.053
Ooh!

58:51.127 --> 58:53.220
Ew!

58:55.899 --> 59:00.393
Willie, we are going to die!

59:00.470 --> 59:02.267
It's soft.

59:04.574 --> 59:06.405
It's moving!

59:14.384 --> 59:15.510
Got it!

59:30.333 --> 59:32.267
Get 'em off of me!
Get 'em off of me!

59:32.335 --> 59:33.597
They're all over me!

59:33.670 --> 59:35.160
Get 'em off me!

59:36.406 --> 59:37.668
Huh?

59:37.740 --> 59:39.139
No!

59:40.944 --> 59:43.174
It wasn't me! It's her!

59:43.246 --> 59:44.110
Huh?!

59:44.180 --> 59:45.841
Come on!

59:45.915 --> 59:47.348
Go! Move!

59:47.417 --> 59:48.645
Come on, move!

59:48.718 --> 59:50.515
Come on!

01:00:49.174 --> 01:00:51.836
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:53.935
They're worshipping Kali.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.612
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.489
Nobody's seen this
for a hundred years.

01:02:42.621 --> 01:02:48.389
Kali Ma.
Kali Ma...

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.485
Kali Ma!

01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:28.963
He's still alive.

01:04:53.185 --> 01:04:55.813
Kali Ma.

01:04:55.887 --> 01:04:59.186
Kali Ma...

01:05:55.914 --> 01:05:59.714
That's the rock they
took from the village.

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:02.548
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

01:06:08.927 --> 01:06:10.417
Why they glow like that?

01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:12.929
Shh, shh.

01:06:12.998 --> 01:06:14.431
The legend says

01:06:14.499 --> 01:06:15.966
when the rocks are
brought together,

01:06:16.034 --> 01:06:19.128
the diamonds inside
them will glow.

01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:20.865
Diamonds?

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:22.031
Diamonds.

01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:23.301
-Diamonds!
-Shh.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:24.433
Diamonds.

01:06:40.859 --> 01:06:42.793
Hey, hey.

01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:45.591
Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

01:06:45.664 --> 01:06:47.291
Shorty, you keep an eye on her.

01:06:47.365 --> 01:06:48.627
Why, where are you going?

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.632
Down there.

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:50.793
Down there?!

01:06:50.869 --> 01:06:52.302
Are you crazy?!

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:55.635
I'm not leaving here
without the stones.

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:56.799
You could get killed

01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:58.809
chasing after your damn
fortune and glory!

01:06:58.877 --> 01:07:00.606
Maybe.

01:07:00.679 --> 01:07:03.773
But not today.

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:21.149
Be careful.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.791
Where's he going?

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.798
Let me go... !

01:09:40.004 --> 01:09:43.906
Run, Willie! Run!

01:11:16.301 --> 01:11:18.064
Dr. Jones!

01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:21.500
I keep telling you,

01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:24.804
you listen me more,
you live longer.

01:11:24.943 --> 01:11:27.935
Please, let me die.

01:11:28.012 --> 01:11:30.276
I pray to Siva,

01:11:30.348 --> 01:11:33.977
''Let me die,'' but I do not.

01:11:34.052 --> 01:11:37.044
Now... now the evil
of Kali take me.

01:11:38.756 --> 01:11:39.984
How?

01:11:40.058 --> 01:11:43.027
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

01:11:43.094 --> 01:11:45.324
Then I'll fall
into the black sleep

01:11:45.396 --> 01:11:46.829
of the Kali Ma.

01:11:46.931 --> 01:11:48.125
What is that?

01:11:48.199 --> 01:11:50.599
We become like them.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:56.329
We'll be alive,
but like a nightmare.

01:11:56.407 --> 01:12:00.468
You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.

01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:16.388
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:19.453
There were five stones
in the beginning.

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:22.897
Over the centuries, they
were dispersed by wars,

01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:24.958
sold off by thieves like you.

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:27.129
Thieves like me, huh?

01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:28.137
Ha!

01:12:28.206 --> 01:12:30.970
Still missing two.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:34.136
A century ago, when the
British raided this temple

01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:35.804
and butchered my people,

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.314
a loyal priest hid
the last two stones

01:12:38.383 --> 01:12:39.975
down here in the catacombs.

01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:42.645
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.779
They're innocent children.

01:12:44.856 --> 01:12:47.654
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

01:12:49.727 --> 01:12:54.528
They also search
for the last two stones.

01:12:54.599 --> 01:12:58.000
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,

01:12:58.069 --> 01:13:01.971
and the Thuggees will be
all powerful.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.941
What a vivid imagination.

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:11.281
You...

01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:13.715
don't believe me?

01:13:13.785 --> 01:13:18.017
You will, Dr. Jones.

01:13:18.089 --> 01:13:21.286
You will become...

01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:23.623
a true believer.

01:13:40.378 --> 01:13:42.209
Hi.

01:14:06.838 --> 01:14:07.930
Dr. Jones!

01:14:08.005 --> 01:14:09.495
Don't drink-- it's bad!

01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:11.565
Don't drink!

01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:13.075
Spit it out!

01:14:46.911 --> 01:14:47.878
Dr. Jones...

01:15:07.165 --> 01:15:11.431
You dare not do that.

01:15:28.219 --> 01:15:30.517
Leave him alone, you bastards!

01:15:41.032 --> 01:15:43.364
The British in India
will be slaughtered.

01:15:43.434 --> 01:15:46.130
Then we will overrun
the Muslims.

01:15:46.204 --> 01:15:48.764
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.398
And then the Christian God

01:15:50.474 --> 01:15:52.499
will be cast down and forgotten.

01:15:54.879 --> 01:15:57.939
Soon, Kali Ma
will rule the world.

01:16:04.021 --> 01:16:06.012
Dr. Jones...

01:17:48.793 --> 01:17:51.819
Kali Ma protects us.

01:17:53.197 --> 01:17:54.960
We are her children.

01:17:55.032 --> 01:17:58.195
We pledge our devotion to her

01:17:58.269 --> 01:17:59.896
with an offering of flesh...

01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:02.098
What are you doing?!

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:07.439
...and blood.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:21.583
Your friend has seen...
and she has heard.

01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:25.925
Now she will not talk.

01:18:33.604 --> 01:18:35.765
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

01:18:35.906 --> 01:18:37.635
about this place
when I get back.

01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:40.677
Indy! For God sakes, help me!

01:18:40.745 --> 01:18:43.646
Wh-What's the matter with you?

01:18:58.996 --> 01:19:01.521
No... no.

01:19:32.163 --> 01:19:33.790
Come.

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.492
Come.

01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:01.653
Indiana...

01:20:03.527 --> 01:20:09.295
Indiana... help us.

01:20:20.878 --> 01:20:23.813
Please, snap out of it.

01:20:23.914 --> 01:20:26.940
You're not one of them.

01:20:29.253 --> 01:20:32.586
You're not one of them.

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:37.060
Please come back to us.

01:20:37.128 --> 01:20:39.961
Don't leave me.

01:20:52.576 --> 01:20:55.044
No!

01:20:57.348 --> 01:20:59.873
What are you doing?!

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:01.542
Are you mad?!

01:22:16.493 --> 01:22:17.585
Oh...

01:22:17.661 --> 01:22:21.461
Oh, this can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

01:22:21.532 --> 01:22:24.660
Wake up, Willie, wake up.

01:22:55.699 --> 01:22:58.566
No! No! No... !

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.512
No!

01:23:10.581 --> 01:23:12.481
No, no, no!

01:23:12.549 --> 01:23:16.485
Wake up, Dr. Jones,
wake up!

01:23:19.757 --> 01:23:21.088
Dr. Jones!

01:23:35.606 --> 01:23:38.598
Indy, I love you.

01:23:39.576 --> 01:23:41.942
Wake up, Indy!

01:23:42.012 --> 01:23:42.808
Wake up!

01:23:44.715 --> 01:23:46.580
You're my best friend!

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:47.844
Wake up, Indy!

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:55.281
Wait! Wait!

01:23:55.359 --> 01:23:58.487
He's mine!

01:24:00.831 --> 01:24:02.799
I'm all right, kid.

01:24:47.745 --> 01:24:49.042
Mola Ram!

01:26:10.861 --> 01:26:12.624
Give me some slack!

01:26:31.615 --> 01:26:34.641
Willie, Willie, wake up!

01:26:36.987 --> 01:26:39.353
Willie, Willie, it's me!
I'm back!

01:26:41.925 --> 01:26:43.950
Oh, Indy.

01:27:11.288 --> 01:27:14.849
Indy... my friend.

01:27:14.925 --> 01:27:18.088
I'm sorry, kid.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.326
Indy...

01:27:24.401 --> 01:27:27.598
now, let's get out of here.

01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:32.108
Right. All of us.

01:28:45.148 --> 01:28:45.739
No!

01:29:03.233 --> 01:29:04.359
I've got to save him!

01:29:04.434 --> 01:29:05.924
He can take care of himself.

01:29:06.003 --> 01:29:06.935
He needs me.

01:29:09.172 --> 01:29:10.833
I've got to save Indy!

01:29:23.186 --> 01:29:24.653
Okay, save him.

01:29:29.092 --> 01:29:30.423
Drop him down!

01:29:30.494 --> 01:29:31.961
I kill you!

01:29:32.029 --> 01:29:34.657
Drop him down!

01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:38.832
Whoa!

01:30:04.161 --> 01:30:05.719
What's the matter with him?

01:30:48.905 --> 01:30:50.873
Here. Try this.

01:32:05.982 --> 01:32:07.643
Go, Indy!

01:33:10.046 --> 01:33:12.480
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:26.684
Short Round!

01:33:27.697 --> 01:33:29.528
Quit fooling around
with that kid!

01:33:29.599 --> 01:33:31.066
Get down in the cart, now!

01:33:31.134 --> 01:33:32.795
Okeydokey, Indy!

01:33:32.869 --> 01:33:33.995
Please listen.

01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:36.163
To get out,
you must take the left tunnel.

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:37.433
Thank you.

01:34:25.188 --> 01:34:26.120
Shorty!

01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:27.156
Quit stalling!

01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:29.380
Come on, Indy!

01:34:29.459 --> 01:34:30.619
Go!

01:34:30.694 --> 01:34:32.252
Go! Go!

01:34:35.165 --> 01:34:36.427
Shorty, look out!

01:34:46.242 --> 01:34:47.766
-Come on!
-Indy!

01:34:52.649 --> 01:34:53.513
Hurry!

01:34:58.888 --> 01:34:59.946
Hurry!

01:35:00.023 --> 01:35:00.853
Hurry up!

01:35:06.496 --> 01:35:08.088
Indy, take the left tunnel!

01:35:08.164 --> 01:35:09.631
The left tunnel!

01:35:09.699 --> 01:35:10.961
No, Indy!

01:35:11.034 --> 01:35:12.797
You missed it!
Left tunnel!

01:35:41.798 --> 01:35:45.461
We got company!

01:35:49.706 --> 01:35:50.638
Stop.

01:35:50.707 --> 01:35:51.469
Let her go!

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.304
-Let go of the brake.
-What?

01:35:53.376 --> 01:35:54.468
What?

01:35:54.544 --> 01:35:56.808
Let her go. Our only chance
is to outrun them.

01:36:13.863 --> 01:36:14.955
-Shorty?
-Huh?

01:36:15.031 --> 01:36:16.623
Come up here
and take the brake.

01:36:17.834 --> 01:36:18.926
Watch it on the curves,

01:36:19.002 --> 01:36:20.594
or we'll fly
right off the track.

01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:22.035
Okay.

01:37:17.994 --> 01:37:19.655
Yay!

01:37:43.286 --> 01:37:44.378
What are you doing?

01:37:44.454 --> 01:37:45.580
Short cut.

01:37:45.655 --> 01:37:47.179
-Yes, Indy.
-Short, cut.

01:38:11.147 --> 01:38:13.707
Watch it!

01:38:16.953 --> 01:38:18.181
Indy, help!

01:38:21.491 --> 01:38:23.049
-Hang on!
-Indy!

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:24.927
Pull him in.

01:38:24.994 --> 01:38:26.484
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:38:27.764 --> 01:38:28.992
Let go of him!

01:38:30.233 --> 01:38:31.996
No! No!

01:38:32.068 --> 01:38:33.899
Pull him in!

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:35.062
-I'll catch him!
-No!

01:39:21.784 --> 01:39:22.682
Duck!

01:39:42.305 --> 01:39:43.397
All right.

01:39:43.473 --> 01:39:44.770
-What?
-Brakes. Brakes.

01:39:44.874 --> 01:39:46.637
Slow us down.

01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:47.835
Okay.

01:39:51.748 --> 01:39:53.306
Uh-oh. Big mistake.

01:39:53.383 --> 01:39:54.577
Big mistake, Indy.

01:39:54.651 --> 01:39:56.414
Figures.

01:40:17.674 --> 01:40:19.198
We're going too fast!

01:40:19.275 --> 01:40:20.367
Too fast!

01:40:20.443 --> 01:40:22.035
We're going to crash!

01:40:34.023 --> 01:40:36.150
Water, water, water!

01:40:36.225 --> 01:40:37.817
Oh, look!
Look there!

01:40:37.927 --> 01:40:39.690
-Water!
-Fire! You're on fire!

01:40:39.762 --> 01:40:40.694
Water, water!

01:40:40.763 --> 01:40:41.695
Look...

01:40:41.764 --> 01:40:42.731
Water, water.

01:40:44.834 --> 01:40:46.768
Water, water.

01:40:46.836 --> 01:40:49.327
Come on...
Come on!

01:41:02.618 --> 01:41:03.983
Let's go!

01:41:07.924 --> 01:41:09.255
Run, run!

01:41:21.971 --> 01:41:24.098
Willie, look out!

01:41:33.716 --> 01:41:34.808
No!

01:41:34.951 --> 01:41:37.283
Head for the bridge. Go!

01:41:39.622 --> 01:41:40.884
Come on, Willie, this way.

01:41:53.936 --> 01:41:55.130
Oh, God.

01:41:55.204 --> 01:41:56.933
Come on, let's go.

01:41:57.006 --> 01:41:58.098
Strong bridge.

01:41:58.174 --> 01:41:59.471
Come on, let's go.

01:41:59.542 --> 01:42:00.600
Strong bridge.

01:42:00.676 --> 01:42:03.338
Look-- strong wood.

01:42:03.413 --> 01:42:04.880
Come on!

01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:05.606
Look!

01:42:06.416 --> 01:42:07.508
Shorty!

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.552
Help!

01:42:11.621 --> 01:42:12.610
I'm falling down.

01:42:14.424 --> 01:42:16.654
Help!

01:42:18.027 --> 01:42:19.995
Not very funny.

01:42:44.821 --> 01:42:46.186
Back!

01:43:11.981 --> 01:43:14.779
Welcome.

01:43:24.393 --> 01:43:25.587
Ow!

01:43:25.661 --> 01:43:28.755
Let her go, Mola Ram.

01:43:28.831 --> 01:43:31.265
You are in a position
unsuitable

01:43:31.334 --> 01:43:33.165
to give orders.

01:43:33.236 --> 01:43:34.498
Watch your back!

01:43:42.111 --> 01:43:45.376
You want the stones,
let 'em go.

01:43:49.952 --> 01:43:51.351
Let her go!

01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:55.350
Drop them, Dr. Jones.

01:43:55.424 --> 01:43:57.551
They will be found.

01:43:57.627 --> 01:44:00.027
You won't.

01:44:02.598 --> 01:44:04.361
Indy!

01:44:04.433 --> 01:44:06.901
Behind you!

01:44:14.176 --> 01:44:16.667
Oh, shit.

01:44:26.622 --> 01:44:28.590
Go on.

01:44:28.658 --> 01:44:31.491
Go.

01:44:40.770 --> 01:44:43.068
Go on!
Go on!

01:44:43.139 --> 01:44:45.607
That way.

01:44:48.611 --> 01:44:50.875
Shorty...

01:44:56.419 --> 01:44:57.386
Hang on, lady.

01:44:57.453 --> 01:44:58.943
We going for a ride.

01:45:00.456 --> 01:45:02.617
Oh, my God!

01:45:03.626 --> 01:45:06.117
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

01:45:06.195 --> 01:45:07.924
Oh, my God!

01:45:07.997 --> 01:45:09.965
Is he nuts?

01:45:10.032 --> 01:45:12.330
He no nuts.

01:45:12.401 --> 01:45:14.232
He's crazy.

01:45:14.303 --> 01:45:18.763
Mola Ram,
prepare to meet Kali...

01:45:18.908 --> 01:45:21.138
in hell.

01:45:22.011 --> 01:45:23.137
What are you doing?!

01:45:23.212 --> 01:45:24.270
You fool!

01:46:25.241 --> 01:46:26.970
Indy, cover your heart!

01:46:27.043 --> 01:46:29.534
Cover your heart!

01:46:29.612 --> 01:46:31.409
Oh, my God!

01:46:41.323 --> 01:46:42.585
Oh, my God.

01:47:25.701 --> 01:47:27.032
-Look out!
-No!

01:47:53.062 --> 01:47:54.120
No!

01:47:57.867 --> 01:48:00.665
Hurry! Let's go!

01:48:00.736 --> 01:48:03.227
The stones are mine!

01:48:03.305 --> 01:48:06.206
You've betrayed Siva.

01:48:10.479 --> 01:48:12.037
You betrayed Siva.

01:48:21.223 --> 01:48:22.747
You betrayed Siva!

01:48:54.957 --> 01:48:56.720
Well, it's about time.

01:49:14.543 --> 01:49:16.636
Hold your fire.

01:51:18.267 --> 01:51:21.464
We know you are coming back

01:51:21.537 --> 01:51:24.506
when life return to our village.

01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:35.312
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

01:51:35.384 --> 01:51:39.480
Yes, I understand its power now.

01:51:44.693 --> 01:51:46.354
You could've kept it.

01:51:46.428 --> 01:51:47.622
Ah, what for?

01:51:47.696 --> 01:51:49.163
They'd just put it in a museum.

01:51:49.231 --> 01:51:51.062
It'd be another rock
collecting dust.

01:51:51.133 --> 01:51:54.068
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

01:51:54.136 --> 01:51:56.070
Anything could happen.

01:51:56.138 --> 01:51:57.935
It's a long way to Delhi.

01:51:58.007 --> 01:51:59.634
No, thanks.

01:51:59.708 --> 01:52:02.199
No more adventures
with you, Dr. Jones.

01:52:02.277 --> 01:52:05.906
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

01:52:05.981 --> 01:52:09.508
If you think I'm going to Delhi
with you, or anyplace else

01:52:09.585 --> 01:52:09.752
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

01:52:09.752 --> 01:52:12.050
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

01:52:12.121 --> 01:52:13.782
think again, buster!

01:52:13.856 --> 01:52:16.416
I'm going home to Missouri where
they never feed you snakes,

01:52:16.492 --> 01:52:19.256
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

01:52:19.328 --> 01:52:22.786
This is not my idea
of a swell time!

01:52:22.931 --> 01:52:24.228
Excuse me, sir.

01:52:24.299 --> 01:52:25.766
I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

01:52:40.215 --> 01:52:42.115
Oh...

01:52:45.621 --> 01:52:47.885
Very funny.

01:52:53.429 --> 01:52:54.896
Very funny.

01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.494
Uh-oh.
