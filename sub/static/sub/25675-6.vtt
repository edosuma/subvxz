00:04.003 --> 00:07.883
You wait 30 years for the woman you love,

00:07.883 --> 00:10.636
and finally you get her.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.930
And she slips through your fingers.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.181
I can help her.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.227
Marret's watching the baby?

00:18.227 --> 00:19.603
Wendell is 15, Mom.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.146
I want Wendell to be able

00:21.146 --> 00:22.397
to remember her when she's gone.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.398
I guess he could

00:23.398 --> 00:24.733
take a bus up there.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.944
You feel guilty about your mom,

00:26.944 --> 00:28.362
and your father,

00:28.362 --> 00:29.988
and your son, who barely has a father.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.700
Your right ear is ringing,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.078
so loud you can barely hear yourself think.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.330
Do you listen to 
loud music in your earbuds?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.915
It could just be tinnitus.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.459
- Do you hear it right now?
- Comes and goes.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.336
Used to bother me
when I was a teenager.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.307
Henry?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.952
Behold, I tell you a mystery.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.706
We will not all sleep,

01:20.706 --> 01:22.583
but we will all be changed.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.920
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye...

01:26.920 --> 01:28.839
at the last trumpet,

01:28.839 --> 01:31.592
and we will be changed.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.093
For the trumpet shall sound,

01:33.093 --> 01:34.928
and the dead shall be raised,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
imperishable,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.808
and we will all...
be changed.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.981
For this perishable
must put on the imperishable,

01:45.981 --> 01:49.067
and this mortal must put on...

01:49.067 --> 01:51.403
immortality.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.949
But when this perishable
put on the imperishable

01:55.949 --> 01:58.744
and this... mortal...

02:00.162 --> 02:03.123
put on immortality,

02:03.123 --> 02:06.919
then...
will come about the saying

02:06.919 --> 02:08.836
that is written...

02:11.798 --> 02:15.260
Death...

02:15.260 --> 02:17.471
is swallowed up in victory.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.112
Lord,

02:34.112 --> 02:36.448
we commit...

02:36.448 --> 02:40.869
We commit this...

02:40.869 --> 02:44.248
vessel... to the earth.

02:46.250 --> 02:50.045
Matthew, wherever you are,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.965
our hearts will visit you here.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.682
Would you like to say anything?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.232
Bye, Dad.

03:58.822 --> 04:02.618
They sold it to a yard down in Syracuse.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.584
Then you go to Syracuse.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.711
I've gotta pick up Ruth at the hospital.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.548
What do we need it for?
How's it gonna help her, anyway?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.638
I can't explain in words you'd understand.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.389
Well, fuckin' try me.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.355
Time is her enemy, Sheriff.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.259
Front door open.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.248
Now, a few minutes ago
I read a list of words

06:13.248 --> 06:15.125
and asked you to repeat them.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.044
Can you repeat them back to me now?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.629
Any order you like.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.257
Mrs. Deaver?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.061
Listen, after I get you settled,

06:34.061 --> 06:36.271
I got some business to take care of.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.525
When I come back,
I'm not going anywhere,

06:39.525 --> 06:41.568
and neither are you.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.029
We're gonna fix you up as good as new.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.283
Yeah, I just...

06:48.283 --> 06:51.036
I just need a system, that's all.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.791
Front door open.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.775
I'll get your bags for you.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.487
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem. Here you go.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.202
- Wendell.
- Hey.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.914
Hey, man.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.916
One second.
I'm trying to beat level 4.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.469
They ran out of golf posters, huh?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.222
Hey, Grant Fuhr is the greatest
black hockey player of all time.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.228
I really appreciate 
you comin' up here, man.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.771
It means a lot to me.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.065
Sure.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.484
What is that, a...
a VR game?

08:04.484 --> 08:07.154
Thief-A-Desty's AR.
VR is the goggles.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.700
It'll mean a lot to your grandmother,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.869
you being here.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.205
She can't get down to Boston 
so much anymore.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.081
I guess it runs in the family.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.209
Wendell.

08:22.711 --> 08:23.837
Wendell.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.885
Sorry.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.138
Hey.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.264
Come on.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.273
Mom?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.778
Found a hitchhiker.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.822
Oh! Come in and give me a hug.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.743
Oh, look at you.
Look at you.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.120
Come on, I'll fix lunch.
You two can catch up.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.216
Mm-hmm.
- How much is it?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.385
With a year lease it'll be 2250.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.803
OK, when can I see it?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.513
I could show you the space tomorrow if...

09:14.513 --> 09:16.640
Are people evacuated because of the fires?

09:16.640 --> 09:20.477
No. No, there's no evacuation.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.729
It's just a... a little smoke.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.691
I googled Prospect Street, Castle Rock.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.276
Seems like some pretty awful things

09:27.276 --> 09:28.735
have happened in that neighborhood.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.948
Is that area safe for kids now?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.577
Hello?

09:51.175 --> 09:53.552
"Death is swallowed up in victory."

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
Hardcore.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.560
Mom, I got lunch under control.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.228
You should stay off your feet.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.147
I thought you were the only one there.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.440
Who are all the programs for?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.194
The church printed 'em up.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.904
They're gonna have
some recycling to do.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.408
I'm serious, Mom.
It's turkey and bread.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.161
Well, you better make his a double.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.122
Want to be an astronaut, you're gonna
need some meat on your bones.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.749
No, we're past that.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.126
These days he's all about graphic design.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.628
You oughta show her your drawings.

10:32.174 --> 10:37.012
Coulda sworn we...
we buried him in that suit.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.430
Buried? Who?

10:40.015 --> 10:40.933
Your father.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.897
Whoa.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.315
Who's that?

10:49.900 --> 10:50.943
My client.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.740
He's, uh, staying in the...

11:07.501 --> 11:09.837
Hello? Yeah...

11:49.585 --> 11:50.752
Hey.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.090
Hey, pop a wheelie.

11:55.090 --> 11:58.177
Come on, you can be the next Evel Knievel.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.682
Come out, come out,
wherever you are, Henry.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.601
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

12:05.601 --> 12:07.686
Krakatoa has exploded,

12:07.686 --> 12:09.897
a fiery monster in its belly.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.774
Give us a wave, Godzilla.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.783
You're lagging. 
Let's go.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.121
Which way do you think it is, son?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.414
I don't know.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.835
The Lord blesses those who listen

12:31.835 --> 12:33.170
more than they talk.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.421
You keep movin', boy.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.716
Ignore the wind.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.885
Ignore the sound of your own footsteps.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.138
I made some calls.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.682
Got some good news.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.150
It's a good place.
Better than it used to be.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.279
They'll help you out,
get you back to being yourself.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.198
- Mr. Deaver?
- Yeah.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.324
This is...

13:45.951 --> 13:47.703
Well, here he is.

13:54.168 --> 13:57.337
Oh, my God!

13:58.839 --> 14:00.424
Second time this week.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.055
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.015
Come on.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.874
Hey.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.710
Sorry, I had to run out.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.297
Get some sleep.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.343
You were, like, six...

14:44.343 --> 14:46.887
when you were adopted, right?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.388
Five.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.351
Why didn't they have their own kid?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.480
They tried.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.235
They lost a baby...
during labor.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.570
I guess they...

15:03.570 --> 15:06.323
I guess they didn't want
to go down that road again.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.787
What were they like?

15:11.787 --> 15:12.913
Your real parents.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.918
Grandma and Grandpa are my real parents.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.717
See you in the morning.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.734
Mom?

15:42.734 --> 15:45.320
Just come on in, for God's sake.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.783
Did you take your pills?
You need a glass of water?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.201
No, no, no.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.829
I've been dry-swallowing for decades.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.135
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.849
What did Dad and I used to do

16:13.849 --> 16:14.933
when we went out to the woods?

16:17.311 --> 16:20.522
Oh, you know, camping,

16:20.522 --> 16:24.109
fishing, a little duck huntin' in season.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.195
'Course I had to teach him half of it.

16:29.573 --> 16:34.244
Did he ever talk about hearing a...
sound out there?

16:34.244 --> 16:36.580
- Who?
- Dad.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.168
Well, wh...

16:41.168 --> 16:42.878
How would I know if...

16:42.878 --> 16:44.796
How would I know something like that?

16:46.882 --> 16:48.300
Go ask your father.

17:13.909 --> 17:17.204
Now, we have to
try really hard this time.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.748
Really hard, son.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.044
Lead the way.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.377
Do you hear something?

17:28.516 --> 17:29.886
Do you hear something?

17:45.274 --> 17:47.651
- Is Molly here?
- Around back.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.037
Did you ever see us
go out to the woods?

17:59.037 --> 18:02.165
At weird hours?
In the middle of the night?

18:04.668 --> 18:07.045
Maybe a few times, I guess.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.846
I'm just...

18:17.347 --> 18:20.142
Just trying to understand

18:20.142 --> 18:21.768
why he was dragging me out there

18:21.768 --> 18:24.438
and why I can't remember anything.

18:24.438 --> 18:25.939
I mean, why would I have...

18:33.739 --> 18:37.451
- Do you ever hear anything?
- No. But I know you do.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.039
On those tapes, I don't know,

18:42.039 --> 18:44.708
it sounds like he was losing his mind.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.335
You hated him, Henry.

18:51.632 --> 18:53.717
I told you that?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.344
You didn't have to.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.640
I was there...

19:01.642 --> 19:03.727
in the woods,
the night you disappeared.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.940
You... You were in the woods?

19:07.940 --> 19:11.902
No, I... You were in the woods,

19:11.902 --> 19:14.571
and I was a part of you,
and you were a part of me.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.448
We... We were the same.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.158
If you were there, then tell me
what the hell happened.

19:18.158 --> 19:22.037
I don't know. I...
All I know is what you felt.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.914
- What was that?
- Afraid. And then...

19:23.914 --> 19:25.624
What? What?!

19:27.167 --> 19:28.168
Relieved.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.923
What, because I thought
he was gone?

19:32.923 --> 19:34.007
I don't know. Probably.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.262
Do you even...
even hear what you're saying?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.431
You wanted him dead.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.027
That's why I went to your parents' room.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.822
- When?
- I don't even know...

19:56.822 --> 19:58.490
how I got there.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.368
It was just like a dream.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.953
Like your dream.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.289
For a while I convinced myself it...

20:05.289 --> 20:07.583
It didn't really happen,

20:07.583 --> 20:09.418
but it did happen.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.088
He was lying there.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.883
I pulled out the tube.

20:15.883 --> 20:17.926
He was looking right at me
when he died.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.722
- What is wrong with you?
- It's true.

20:21.722 --> 20:26.476
- He died of his injuries.
- No, he died because...

20:26.476 --> 20:30.063
of me, because it was
what you wanted.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.398
You killed him for me?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.819
We did it together.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.988
When I looked down at my hand,

20:37.988 --> 20:41.491
it was like it was your hand.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.452
You did it through me.

20:43.452 --> 20:47.122
You... are fucking crazy.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.838
Front door open.

21:40.008 --> 21:43.887
Hey. Um, I gotta deal with a work thing.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.389
You two OK for a couple hours?

21:45.389 --> 21:46.723
Yeah, we're good.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.020
Front door open.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.731
So, what's the deal
with all the missing pieces?

21:58.068 --> 22:00.696
Grandma?

22:00.696 --> 22:02.990
You're not having a stroke, are you?

22:06.243 --> 22:10.038
If I tell you something,
can you keep your mouth shut?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.290
Definitely.

22:14.543 --> 22:17.212
We've been here before.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.797
This conversation.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.634
We'll be here again.

22:22.634 --> 22:26.388
Life used to go in one direction...

22:26.388 --> 22:30.684
forward, like one of those...

22:30.684 --> 22:32.686
people-movers at the airport.

22:32.686 --> 22:35.063
But somehow I got off it.

22:35.063 --> 22:39.735
It's like I just brought
your father home from...

22:39.735 --> 22:41.778
from foster care.

22:41.778 --> 22:45.908
He was half your size.
And now here you are.

22:45.908 --> 22:49.161
And for all I know, my father's outside

22:49.161 --> 22:53.165
taking care of his roses...
Younger than me.

22:53.165 --> 22:55.584
And I never know
where I'm goin' next.

22:58.545 --> 23:02.841
The neurologist said,
"Find a coping mechanism."

23:02.841 --> 23:07.179
And I have...
one for every room in the house.

23:07.179 --> 23:09.890
See, I can get lost in the past.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.309
These are my breadcrumbs.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.728
If I find a chess piece in the icebox,

23:14.728 --> 23:18.899
well, I know it's now, not then.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.401
That I can find my way out of the woods.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.160
Shit.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.653
In other news, eight staff members

26:09.653 --> 26:11.530
and six patients are presumed dead

26:11.530 --> 26:13.240
at a mental institution in Maine

26:13.240 --> 26:15.409
after a fire broke out
earlier this afternoon.

26:15.409 --> 26:18.078
In the chaos, four patients also escaped

26:18.078 --> 26:20.163
from the Juniper Hills Psychiatric Hospital

26:20.163 --> 26:22.875
and are considered dangerous
to themselves and others.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.182
This is it.

26:40.017 --> 26:42.477
Listen, a friend of mine
died in this Lincoln.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.938
- I need to get it back.
- This car's goin' to Fat Tony.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.565
Believe me, he doesn't
give a shit about your friend.

26:46.565 --> 26:48.108
I'll give you 200 bucks for it.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.277
- Ain't for sale.
- Make it 500.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.112
You deaf, asshole?
Get the fuck off my rig!

26:53.906 --> 26:57.743
The woman I love is sick,
and I'm gonna help her.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.037
This piece of shit is mine now.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.716
Damn it.

27:19.848 --> 27:22.518
Back door open.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.614
Hey. Hey. It's OK. It's OK.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.800
Willie frightens easily.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.054
Willie?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.350
You're Willie?

29:28.143 --> 29:29.645
Who are you?

29:33.899 --> 29:34.858
Odin Branch.

29:41.490 --> 29:44.701
Willie's my interpreter and protégé.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.331
I can read lips if you speak
deliberately enough.

29:53.627 --> 29:57.172
You were at the cemetery.
Both of you.

30:01.927 --> 30:05.973
Honestly... I was surprised

30:05.973 --> 30:09.309
you didn't hold your
father's service out here.

30:09.309 --> 30:10.894
This...

30:12.771 --> 30:15.732
This place was his church.

30:15.732 --> 30:16.733
You knew my father?

30:19.486 --> 30:23.448
Very well.
We shared certain interests.

30:23.448 --> 30:26.493
Spirituality, philosophy, physics.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.417
Acoustics.

30:35.002 --> 30:37.129
What are you doing out here?

30:37.129 --> 30:40.007
We're out here to listen, of course.

30:40.007 --> 30:42.009
Just like you.

30:42.009 --> 30:46.013
Also... to correct young Willie.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.103
What are you...
listening to?

31:02.946 --> 31:05.282
Your father called it...

31:05.282 --> 31:08.827
The voice of God.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.711
Please, join us.

31:19.213 --> 31:20.839
I'm fine.

31:26.637 --> 31:28.764
Most people can't hear it at all.

31:30.766 --> 31:34.311
Some hear it once, then never again.

31:36.939 --> 31:40.234
A lucky few hear it constantly.

31:40.234 --> 31:41.944
Practically deafened by it.

31:46.406 --> 31:48.158
Lucky?

31:48.158 --> 31:51.119
There are geographic
variations, naturally.

31:52.538 --> 31:54.581
Quiet in some places...

31:56.792 --> 31:58.836
much louder in others.

32:01.588 --> 32:03.131
You're saying...

32:07.344 --> 32:10.097
You're saying my dad believed
he could hear God...

32:10.097 --> 32:11.431
out here.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.103
For a time.

32:16.103 --> 32:20.440
The ancients called it
the Music of the Spheres.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.277
Of course, I have a more scientific view.

32:23.277 --> 32:24.820
The nature of the schisma

32:24.820 --> 32:26.738
is the preferred nomenclature now.

32:26.738 --> 32:29.199
So you don't believe
God is talking directly to you?

32:30.659 --> 32:35.956
Henry, I have advanced degrees in bio-

32:35.956 --> 32:38.292
and psychoacoustics.

32:38.292 --> 32:41.503
Best I can tell, schisma is actually

32:41.503 --> 32:43.964
nanoscale turbulences

32:43.964 --> 32:46.717
caused by cochlear quantum totalities

32:46.717 --> 32:48.886
abrading in parallel.

32:48.886 --> 32:51.138
Other ears, other nows.

32:54.016 --> 32:58.896
All possible pasts, all possible presents.

32:58.896 --> 33:01.523
Schisma is the sound of the universe

33:01.523 --> 33:03.567
trying to reconcile them.

33:17.289 --> 33:20.042
I, um...
I should get going.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.006
Henry.

33:30.552 --> 33:32.554
To some listeners,

33:32.554 --> 33:35.724
the schisma sounds like
a ringing in the ears.

33:39.186 --> 33:41.980
You... You ever had that, Henry?

33:43.482 --> 33:45.984
A ringing in your ears?

33:45.984 --> 33:50.531
See, the sound may come and go,

33:50.531 --> 33:54.451
but the schisma is eternal...

33:54.451 --> 33:57.663
It's eternal and everywhere,

33:57.663 --> 33:59.748
underlying all space-time.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.962
But it has been getting
louder again, Henry.

34:04.962 --> 34:07.923
It hasn't risen to these levels in...

34:07.923 --> 34:11.009
decades.

34:11.009 --> 34:12.969
The problem is,

34:12.969 --> 34:17.474
no matter how strong the signal...

34:17.474 --> 34:20.893
the world is noise...

34:20.893 --> 34:23.688
auditory distraction...

34:23.688 --> 34:26.190
so even those lucky enough
to hear the schisma

34:26.190 --> 34:29.152
have to clarify, amplify.

34:29.152 --> 34:32.239
And of course, the most committed of us

34:32.239 --> 34:33.699
do more.

34:38.704 --> 34:41.123
What do you mean, more?

34:45.543 --> 34:49.797
During the last amplitude crest...

34:49.797 --> 34:52.801
your father conceived a device.

34:54.136 --> 34:56.263
My father was a minister.

34:56.263 --> 34:58.557
Very much so.

34:58.557 --> 35:02.811
He compared it to the schematics
Noah was dictated from God.

35:02.811 --> 35:05.397
He called it The Filter.

35:08.233 --> 35:11.278
Of course, he never
got the chance to build it.

35:12.821 --> 35:15.032
Fortunately, I did.

35:57.574 --> 35:59.743
It's an anechoic chamber,

35:59.743 --> 36:03.705
but with certain custom modifications.

36:03.705 --> 36:08.877
The wedges are a low-density
polyurethane foam,

36:08.877 --> 36:12.172
and this shape provides
an optimal impedance gradient

36:12.172 --> 36:14.007
for sound waves.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.885
Inside this chamber is total silence...

36:18.720 --> 36:22.391
perhaps the only total silence on Earth.

36:22.391 --> 36:26.186
All noise... cleansed.

36:28.313 --> 36:30.232
And what's left is...

36:30.232 --> 36:32.109
The schisma.

36:36.196 --> 36:38.365
I thought you said
I already hear it.

36:42.369 --> 36:45.664
What you hear now is just a rumor.

36:45.664 --> 36:48.834
What you'll hear in The Filter is...
truth.

36:51.295 --> 36:54.840
The truth is louder,

36:54.840 --> 36:56.175
believe me.

36:57.968 --> 36:59.928
Step inside and hear for yourself.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.930
I'm not getting in there.

37:07.603 --> 37:09.188
That's your choice.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.817
I understand.

37:15.903 --> 37:19.364
Henry, you're suffering so much.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.618
I watched you at the cemetery.

37:23.827 --> 37:26.538
You're searching...

37:29.458 --> 37:31.502
for what kind of man you are.

37:33.045 --> 37:35.797
For why you've come home.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.883
Do you have a child, Henry?

37:39.051 --> 37:41.220
A boy.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.514
Does he know you?

37:43.514 --> 37:44.556
Truly?

37:48.185 --> 37:51.313
How can he if you don't know yourself?

37:53.106 --> 37:56.318
Most men never see the light.

37:59.613 --> 38:02.157
This light isn't something you see.

38:22.511 --> 38:25.055
The schisma is all I hear now.

38:27.683 --> 38:30.227
That's why I did it.

38:30.227 --> 38:32.813
That's why I corrected myself.

38:32.813 --> 38:34.857
And after tonight,

38:34.857 --> 38:37.150
young Willie will be corrected, too.

38:40.404 --> 38:42.281
You made yourself deaf?

38:43.574 --> 38:46.201
Not deaf; Perfect!

38:47.870 --> 38:49.997
Hey! Hey!

39:12.144 --> 39:15.856
Ahh.

39:15.856 --> 39:19.151
Ahh! Ahh!

39:21.737 --> 39:23.989
Do you hear it now?

39:26.325 --> 39:29.786
Do you hear it now, now, now...

39:31.538 --> 39:33.957
Henry, where'd you go?

40:16.667 --> 40:20.629
Got it.
I got that fuckin' Lincoln.

40:20.629 --> 40:24.007
Truck'll be here with it by the morning.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.884
What do we do then?

40:32.808 --> 40:34.810
There will be a monument.

40:36.603 --> 40:38.021
What?!

40:39.815 --> 40:42.442
To Warden Lacy.

40:42.442 --> 40:45.696
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

40:45.696 --> 40:48.907
To everyone who helped put me in that cage.

40:50.492 --> 40:52.703
You said you'd fuckin' help her.

40:52.703 --> 40:53.829
Why would you say that?

41:03.255 --> 41:06.508
Jesus Christ.
Where's Ruth?

41:06.508 --> 41:09.219
Why would you leave me
in that trunk, Sheriff?

41:10.387 --> 41:11.847
Ruthie!

41:14.308 --> 41:15.767
Ruth?

41:15.767 --> 41:17.978
Ruth?

41:24.067 --> 41:25.861
Henry?

41:27.070 --> 41:28.572
Ruth!

41:34.077 --> 41:35.662
Ruthie?

41:37.998 --> 41:40.292
Ruthie?

43:25.522 --> 43:26.815
Bad robot!
