MATTHEW: <i> I remember</i>
<i>the winter of '86.</i>

00:32.951 --> 00:34.702
<i>The snow came early.</i>

00:34.702 --> 00:37.121
<i>And it was time to get</i>
<i>our sleds ready for fun.</i>

00:37.121 --> 00:40.291
Can we be done now?
I'm starving.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.293
No, Simon's grounded
to the house,

00:42.293 --> 00:44.295
so we get first dibs on
the paint.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.714
-Remember what
happened last year?
-I remember.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.091
<i>The war to end all wars had</i>
<i>nothing on the pecking order</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:50.718
<i>of the Buckley brothers.</i>

00:50.718 --> 00:53.429
<i>Today another skirmish in</i>
<i>the struggle</i>

00:53.429 --> 00:55.139
<i>for the coveted</i>
<i>upper hand.</i>

00:55.139 --> 00:57.099
<i>It usually belonged to Simon,</i>

00:57.099 --> 00:59.769
<i>but at this moment,</i>
<i>it belonged to me.</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:01.520
<i>And my brother Peter.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.815
<i>And Simon couldn't stand it.</i>

01:03.815 --> 01:06.484
<i>He had called dibs on</i>
<i>my favorite color, again,</i>

01:06.484 --> 01:09.361
<i>but, uh, I'm not grounded</i>
<i>to the house, am I?</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:12.824
Boys! New decorations came in at
Smithee's, so I'm running

01:12.824 --> 01:14.617
over there to get
some before they run out.

01:14.617 --> 01:17.161
Gee, Mom, how many
more do you need?

01:17.161 --> 01:19.872
That's a good one, honey.
Hot pizza's inside.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.541
Matthew, don't get paint
on those new pants!

01:22.541 --> 01:24.209
Okay!

01:24.209 --> 01:27.046
Pepperoni, my taste
buds are yours.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.016
What? It's locked!

01:40.643 --> 01:42.478
Peter, go check
the other door.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.897
-Okay.
-Ugh.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.532
-Is it open?
-Nope!

01:54.532 --> 01:57.117
Let us in, I have to get
this paint off my pants

01:57.117 --> 01:58.243
before Dad gets home!

01:58.243 --> 02:00.287
And we want some pizza!

02:02.206 --> 02:03.958
This?

02:07.169 --> 02:09.213
Let us in or else!

02:15.177 --> 02:16.929
Let's smash the door down!

02:16.929 --> 02:18.597
Drop the hoe, Peter!

02:18.597 --> 02:21.141
<i>So far, there'd been no</i>
<i>sign of the real enemy.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:22.810
<i>An interesting strategy.</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:25.479
<i>Simon was in there somewhere,</i>
<i>snarfing the pizza</i>

02:25.479 --> 02:27.940
<i>while we raged against</i>
<i>the impenetrable fortress.</i>

<i>favorite person</i>

02:33.029 --> 02:34.613
<i>around Christmas time.</i>

02:34.613 --> 02:36.866
<i>He brought candy,</i>
<i>presents from Grandma,</i>

02:36.866 --> 02:39.077
<i>and the Christmas catalog.</i>

02:39.077 --> 02:40.536
Hey, boys!

02:40.536 --> 02:41.829
-Is it here, is it here yet?
-Not today.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.123
-When?
-Soon! Soon.

02:44.123 --> 02:46.458
<i>Every year, we boys waited</i>
<i>for the Christmas catalog.</i>

02:46.458 --> 02:48.293
<i>Whoever got their hands</i>
<i>on the catalog first</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:49.879
<i>could get their order</i>
<i>in to Santa</i>

02:52.798 --> 02:55.051
<i>Simon got it last year.</i>

02:55.051 --> 02:58.679
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>Simon got it every year.</i>

02:58.679 --> 03:00.598
Simon!

03:03.059 --> 03:06.228
Simon! Over here!

03:06.228 --> 03:07.563
Simon!

03:07.563 --> 03:09.189
Come on!

03:09.189 --> 03:10.691
Go! Go! Go! Go!

03:20.076 --> 03:23.913
<i>I think you forgot</i>
<i>one thing, Simon.</i>

03:23.913 --> 03:26.290
<i>Your sled's outside.</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:31.921
Are you out of
your teeny tiny mind?

03:31.921 --> 03:33.923
<i>For a moment, I thought</i>
<i>I detected a whiff of fear</i>

03:33.923 --> 03:37.259
<i>in Simon's voice; it was</i>
<i>an octave higher than usual.</i>

03:37.259 --> 03:38.803
<i>Puberty had so far</i>
<i>eluded Simon.</i>

03:38.803 --> 03:40.345
<i>It was his Achilles' heel.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.598
You have 30 seconds
to let us in.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.684
But all your stuff is in here
and I'm going to destroy it.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.187
Remember what Dad did the last
time you destroyed my stuff?

03:48.187 --> 03:52.441
Fine! I'll unlock
the front door.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.693
<i>Huh... I won.</i>

03:54.693 --> 03:57.279
<i>And with fewer</i>
<i>casualties than normal.</i>

03:59.406 --> 04:02.201
<i>When the calm voice of</i>
<i>reason kicked in later,</i>

04:02.201 --> 04:04.745
<i>I cursed myself for falling</i>
<i>for Simon's bluff.</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:06.497
Ugh!

04:11.376 --> 04:13.295
<i>How did he get the sled?</i>

04:15.339 --> 04:17.423
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:22.763
Traitor!

04:22.763 --> 04:26.600
Sorry!
I was hungry!

04:26.600 --> 04:29.728
<i>My goal in life back</i>
<i>then was to beat Simon.</i>

04:29.728 --> 04:32.356
<i>Beat him at something,</i>
<i>anything, it didn't matter.</i>

04:32.356 --> 04:35.734
<i>Simon always won, no</i>
<i>matter what it was, he won.</i>

04:35.734 --> 04:37.528
<i>But today would be different.</i>

04:37.528 --> 04:39.864
<i>Today, I would win.</i>

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

04:44.952 --> 04:46.411

04:46.411 --> 04:47.746
Keep your hands

05:01.010 --> 05:03.095
Kris Kringle
is going on out here?

05:03.095 --> 05:05.472
Well, how should I know?
I lost my glasses,

05:05.472 --> 05:09.227
and you know I can't
see a thing without them.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.103
-They wrecked Simon's sled!
-You ate all the pizza!

05:11.103 --> 05:13.605
-They locked us out!
-Matthew wiped paint

<i>wouldn't you know it?</i>

05:38.422 --> 05:41.800
<i>Simon suddenly realized</i>
<i>he was allergic to feathers.</i>

05:45.387 --> 05:47.723
<i>I was born second,</i>

Good girl, Rosie.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.832
<i>Yeah, Peter never quite caught</i>
<i>on that chickens aren't pets.</i>

06:13.832 --> 06:16.043
I mean, chickens
don't even like people.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.254
<i>Rosie bit me once,</i>
<i>so I know.</i>

06:20.131 --> 06:22.382
No fair! Simon

06:22.382 --> 06:24.635
You know milk gives
him a tummy ache.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.845
<i>Yeah, Simon</i>
<i>was lactose intolerant</i>

Peter, can you just get Rosie

07:14.768 --> 07:16.812
in her coop before
you go to school?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.148
She left me a little present

12:32.294 --> 12:34.338
Back off, brothers!

12:49.978 --> 12:53.898
I'm gonna get that Finn Hagbart
if it's the last thing I do.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.151
You and what army?

13:02.782 --> 13:08.246
["Romeo and Juliet
Fantasy Overture" plays]

13:26.973 --> 13:30.101
Looks like we have
new neighbors.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.687
Why are you talking funny?

13:31.687 --> 13:33.480
I'm not talking funny.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.441
<i>You know the first time you</i>
<i>notice that a girl is a girl?</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:37.817
Stay here.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.405
<i>Yeah...</i>

13:41.405 --> 13:44.449
John, boil the eggs.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.410
Okay.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.458
Why are you here?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.126
No reason.

14:05.053 --> 14:08.348
<i>Peter was... too young</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

14:10.642 --> 14:12.728
Boys, eleven o'clock.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.195
What are you doing?

14:24.322 --> 14:27.033
Gathering... soil samples?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.993
<i>How do I keep</i>
<i>losing to this guy?</i>

14:28.993 --> 14:31.162
Fascinating.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.956
I'm Juniper, and you guys are?

14:32.956 --> 14:37.419
I'm Peter, this is Rosie.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.589
Oh, your dog's so cute.
What's her name?

14:40.589 --> 14:42.800
Uhh...

14:44.050 --> 14:48.263
Hi, I'm Alan Goodman.
Nice chicken.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.641
I used to raise dorkens
when I was little.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.768
<i>Dorken? What's a dorken?</i>

14:52.768 --> 14:55.520
You look like you
could use a friend.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.648
<i>Ohhh, that's a dorken.</i>

14:57.648 --> 14:59.650
Boys, let's go, we're late.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.526
I should go.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.237
There's a carnival
at the school later.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.782
You guys should come,
it's free.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.742
Maybe I will. Bye.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.202
-Bye.
-Nice job, Pete!

15:11.202 --> 15:13.497
Huh? What did I do?

15:17.501 --> 15:21.755
Hey, thanks for
boiling the eggs.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.674
What does boil mean?

15:23.674 --> 15:25.425
Mhmm.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.262
Big smiles!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.556
Do not let John bob for apples,
last year he fell in the barrel

15:31.556 --> 15:32.724
and almost drowned.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.601
Alright, no drowning
this year.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.311
And no candy, or junk.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.438
Okay, no candy or junk.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.273
<i>Was she serious?</i>

15:40.273 --> 15:41.983
<i>Candy and junk were flowing</i>
<i>like milk and honey.</i>

15:41.983 --> 15:45.111
But come to my egg and spoon
race, we have prizes.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.780
Not candy.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.240
Toothbrushes, pencils.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.371
I want candy.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.748
Me too. Let's go.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.682
-Thank you.
-Scram!

16:15.517 --> 16:17.602
Why are the Hagbarts so evil?

16:17.602 --> 16:20.188
That's one of life's
great mysteries.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.527
<i>She came!</i>
<i>Sweeter than candy.</i>

16:25.527 --> 16:27.237
Let's go bob for apples.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.988
But you promised Mom.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.700
-I'll hold your feet.
-Yeah, come on.

16:32.576 --> 16:36.120
You said you'd hold my feet.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.416
I could have died.
I'm telling Mom!

16:39.416 --> 16:43.044
You tell Mom,
no catalog, no toys.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.922
MOTHER OVER P.A.: <i> </i>
<i>Attention, kids,</i>

16:44.922 --> 16:47.925
<i>the egg an spoon race will</i>
<i>start in a few minutes.</i>

16:51.845 --> 16:53.931
I've never been in an egg
and spoon race before.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.015
Oh, I have, lots of times.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.101
Matthew Marion Buckley.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.561
Not my middle name!

16:59.561 --> 17:03.648
Did I not ask you to
boil the eggs?

17:03.648 --> 17:05.442
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

17:05.442 --> 17:08.653
<i>Seven years of hiding Marion</i>
<i>from public knowledge,</i>

17:08.653 --> 17:10.530
<i>down the drain.</i>

17:10.530 --> 17:14.200
MOTHER: Matthew, you're in
time-out when we get home.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.869
Very disappointed.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.872
At least I can count on
Simon to do the right thing.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.459
Thank you, sweetheart, for
taking such good care of John.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.502
-My pleasure, Mom.
-But--

17:27.046 --> 17:30.634
<i>Mom says no but, I'm</i>
<i>pretty sure Simon's adopted.</i>

17:32.844 --> 17:35.388
<i>I don't recall when</i>
<i>the parents decided</i>

17:35.388 --> 17:37.808
<i>that the tub was the perfect</i>
<i>place for time-outs,</i>

17:37.808 --> 17:40.644
<i>but eventually, we boys</i>
<i>learned to accept,</i>

17:40.644 --> 17:42.813
<i>and then embrace it.</i>

17:42.813 --> 17:44.397
<i>I mean, we figured</i>
<i>if we were in the tub,</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:46.441
<i>we didn't have to do</i>
<i>chores or homework.</i>

17:46.441 --> 17:48.401
<i>It was a win-win.</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:51.404
So, uh... what did you
do this time?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.032
I don't remember.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.618
That's a good answer.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.412
You've got a future
in politics, I think.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.376
Listen, I think your mom's
had a really, really long day.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.504
I would really appreciate it

18:07.504 --> 18:09.130
if you could try
a little bit harder.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.966
But...

18:10.966 --> 18:15.261
Okay. I'll try.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.347
Thanks.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.017
Now why don't you go apologize,
and then perhaps,

18:20.017 --> 18:22.477
[pirate voice] you,
your brothers, and myself

18:22.477 --> 18:24.813
could make our way
up to the pirate ship.

18:24.813 --> 18:28.316
Sail the seven seas
for a little while.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.902
What do you say about that?

18:30.902 --> 18:32.821
-Arrrrgh.
-Arrrrgh.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.698
Arrrrrrgh.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.492

18:37.492 --> 18:39.828
<i>We pitched in our allowances</i>
<i>for months</i>

18:39.828 --> 18:41.454
<i>to build this with Dad.</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:43.247
<i>It was our sanctuary,</i>

<i>about pirates,</i>

"There he stood on the deck
of the ship,

Drip. Drip. Drip.

they didn't dare move.

Not one lick, for if
they moved they knew

Matthew!

20:05.663 --> 20:09.584
What do ye be dreaming about?

20:09.584 --> 20:11.294
Nothing!

20:11.294 --> 20:14.422
I just liked Dad's story.

20:16.215 --> 20:21.179
You'll like it from
Davey Jones' locker! Ha Ha Ha!

20:21.179 --> 20:23.848
We're here to
pick a family to elve.

20:23.848 --> 20:27.685
Okay, guys, so before
we get started, um...

20:27.685 --> 20:29.353
I just want to make
a quick little announcement

20:29.353 --> 20:30.897
to the family.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.024
Mom is going to
have another baby.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.651
<i>No, really?</i>

20:34.651 --> 20:36.569
It's a boy baby,
right, Daddy?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.071
Well, we don't
really know that yet.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.781
We don't know that yet...
it's a girl.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.283
Girls are putrid.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.995
What about Juniper, is she?

20:44.995 --> 20:47.122
She's different.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.915
Okay, boys, um...
because of the baby,

20:48.915 --> 20:52.794
I won't be able to head up
the elving project this year.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.587
<i>Interesting.</i>

20:54.587 --> 20:58.341
So... its gonna rest on
your shoulders.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.845
Let's do the pledge.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.475
ALL: We do hereby promise

21:07.475 --> 21:12.981
to perform our elving duties
with honor and bravery.

21:12.981 --> 21:16.651
We will never
divulge our identities

21:16.651 --> 21:18.820
to the people we elve,

21:18.820 --> 21:23.033
no matter what mayhem,
or bedlam

21:23.033 --> 21:26.161
might be inflicted upon us.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.579
This is our solemn pledge.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.540
Ralph, you really need
to memorize that

21:30.540 --> 21:32.375
one of these years.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.502
I had it fine, here you go,
Simon, go ahead.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.337
Simon always gets to go first.

21:36.337 --> 21:40.008
Well, it's because I love Simon
more, plus he's the oldest.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.801
We just start in order, okay?

21:43.678 --> 21:45.138
Who wrote this?

21:45.138 --> 21:48.892
We can't elve Mom,
no one can elve Mom.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.685
Yeah, she lives here.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.399
The Goodmans.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.359
Goodmans?

21:59.402 --> 22:01.320
Mom.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.573
For cryin' out loud.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.700
The Goodmans.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.160
You guys only wanna
elve the Goodmans

22:07.160 --> 22:09.412
because you have a mush
crush on Juniper.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.372
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-I do not have a mush crush on--

22:11.372 --> 22:15.168
Hey! Hey! Feet off
the couch, come on!

22:15.168 --> 22:19.463
Alright, obviously,
we have a tie, so...

22:19.463 --> 22:21.841
Since I got two of the votes,

22:21.841 --> 22:24.761
I would kinda like to choose.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.682
There's a family,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.851
they live on
the edge of town.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.815
We think you know
them, the Hagbarts.

22:37.815 --> 22:41.569
-[ominous music]
<i>-Joy... to the world.</i>

22:43.238 --> 22:44.697
Great, that's settled.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.950
Hagbarts it is, then.

22:46.950 --> 22:51.121
["Joy to The World" plays]

22:51.121 --> 22:54.332
So I guess Coca-Cola
is trying a new formula.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.126
Calling it New Coke.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.668
Oh, that's gonna be big.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.378
<i>It sure was.</i>

22:59.378 --> 23:02.257
Well, here's an article
about the school carnival

23:02.257 --> 23:04.508
And a picture of John Buckley.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.136
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.428
Oh, that's, its so cu--

23:07.428 --> 23:09.180
[gasp]

23:12.433 --> 23:14.352
Simon.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.607
[sighs]

23:19.607 --> 23:21.609
Now you have to
miss the first night of elving.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.156
<i>Justice served.</i>

23:26.156 --> 23:28.074
<i>Mom style.</i>

23:40.419 --> 23:43.631
<i>The glorious days of</i>
<i>elving had finally begun.</i>

23:43.631 --> 23:45.175
<i>And even though I wanted</i>
<i>to deck Finn</i>

23:45.175 --> 23:46.843
<i>instead of deck the halls,</i>

23:46.843 --> 23:48.761
<i>I felt a twinge</i>
<i>of excitement.</i>

23:48.761 --> 23:50.972
<i>There was more to this</i>
<i>than giving out treats.</i>

23:50.972 --> 23:53.141
<i>We became</i>
<i>a band of brothers.</i>

23:53.141 --> 23:55.226

Holy moly.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.124
<i>The magic of elving</i>
<i>kicked in.</i>

24:18.124 --> 24:20.043
<i>And when I saw little Francie</i>

<i>I realized that...</i>

24:22.295 --> 24:24.463
<i>maybe she wasn't</i>
<i>so bad after all.</i>

24:36.142 --> 24:40.146
<i>Now I had searched every</i>
<i>square inch of that house.</i>

24:40.146 --> 24:42.899
<i>Maybe the catalog</i>
<i>really hadn't come yet.</i>

24:42.899 --> 24:44.317
[whistling]

24:44.317 --> 24:47.320
Well, hey, buddy,
how are ya?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.322
Sorry.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.283
No catalog today;
maybe tomorrow?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.080
Matthew.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.000
I'm sorry about the other day.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.752
It's kind of
embarrassing

25:02.752 --> 25:05.088
when your mom gets mad at you
in front of your friends.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.090
Thanks.

25:07.090 --> 25:10.593
I was just about to take
the dog for a walk.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.178
Could I come?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.513
Sure, I guess.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.474
If you want to.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.393
I do.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.911
Wow!

25:36.911 --> 25:39.289
-Is this really yours?
-Yeah, it's mine.

25:39.289 --> 25:42.833
Well, it's all of
ours, the Buckley brothers.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.461
Can we go inside?

25:44.461 --> 25:47.004
Well... we better not.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.257
Please?

25:49.257 --> 25:51.426
Okay.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.648
<i>Okay... now what?</i>
<i>Umm... candy?</i>

26:05.648 --> 26:09.110
-Want some?
-Sure. Thanks.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.829
<i>It's just too quiet.</i>

26:23.458 --> 26:26.043
<i>Say something, anything!!</i>

26:26.043 --> 26:29.255
So... what do you want to
be when you grow up?

26:29.255 --> 26:32.842
Probably a lawyer.
What about you?

26:34.885 --> 26:37.721
Well... I'd like
to write, so...

26:37.721 --> 26:40.766
I guess I'll be a writer.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.060
<i>Okay, not bad.</i>

26:43.060 --> 26:45.396
Monica would love
this place.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.898
She loves pirates.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.984
You can't tell Monica.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.236
Only Buckleys
are allowed in here.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.655
I'm not a Buckley.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.534
<i>That's a good point.</i>

26:57.534 --> 26:58.868
<i>Her candy cane!</i>

26:58.868 --> 27:00.578
Stop, Farding!

27:00.578 --> 27:02.121
I didn't, I mean...

27:02.121 --> 27:04.748
No, the dog.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.711
Her name...

27:08.711 --> 27:10.547
It's Farding.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.715
Farding, why?

27:12.715 --> 27:16.052
Well, our mom wears
a lot of pink blush,

27:16.052 --> 27:18.929
and, well, another word
for blush is fard,

27:18.929 --> 27:20.764
and we thought it
was funny, so...

27:20.764 --> 27:23.351
We're just stupid boys.

27:23.351 --> 27:24.894
Aww...

27:24.894 --> 27:27.104
<i>My ship has sunk.</i>

27:27.104 --> 27:30.400
Stop that... Farding.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.235
<i>Oh!</i>

27:32.235 --> 27:36.280
<i>It was then that I knew that</i>
<i>I'd met the girl of my dreams.</i>

27:36.280 --> 27:39.658
<i>Christmas was coming and</i>
<i>things were looking up</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:42.828
<i>for Matthew Marion Buckley.</i>

27:44.455 --> 27:46.541
MOTHER: Not one more sound.
Good night!

27:46.541 --> 27:48.209
[door slams]

27:48.209 --> 27:49.877
If somebody yells good night
at you, do you think

27:49.877 --> 27:52.171
they actually want you
to have a good night?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.048
<i>Now I actually</i>
<i>wanted my own room,</i>

27:54.048 --> 27:56.300
<i>but Mom and Dad thought</i>
<i>we would bond better this way.</i>

27:56.300 --> 27:57.427
Get the pillows.

27:57.427 --> 27:58.928
<i>They were right.</i>

27:58.928 --> 28:02.390
<i>We'd always send Peter</i>
<i>to get the pillows.</i>

28:02.390 --> 28:05.726
<i>He'd sell his soul</i>
<i>for one of those wax bottles.</i>

28:05.726 --> 28:08.187
<i>We bought 'em by the dozen.</i>

28:11.148 --> 28:14.818
[laughing]

28:18.322 --> 28:19.949
[thump]

28:21.742 --> 28:24.579
I'm going up there.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.330
Honey, they're boys.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.792
Sit, grab me that pillow
for my feet.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.338
Can you get 'em up there?

28:34.338 --> 28:38.175
Barely, oh, my gosh, it's just,
this child better be a girl.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.179
-Oh, my gosh.
-You alright?

28:42.179 --> 28:44.098
Oh!

28:44.098 --> 28:46.309
Oh, honey, can you get
me a pillow for my back?

28:46.309 --> 28:48.144
Really?

28:48.144 --> 28:49.937
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.940
I'll hold these.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.817
I bet you will.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.944
It's payback time,
John Buckley.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.321
Payback time, it is.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.030
-Ready, Pete?
-It's ready.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.241
<i>Now John could sleep</i>
<i>through anything.</i>

29:02.241 --> 29:05.495
<i>Once he was out,</i>
<i>he stayed out.</i>

29:09.415 --> 29:11.000
Is he still asleep?

29:12.335 --> 29:14.920
Yeah, he's still asleep.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.423
-You wanna go again?
-Yeah!

29:28.809 --> 29:32.021
[thump]

29:32.021 --> 29:34.231
<i>The lamp!</i>

29:34.231 --> 29:35.525
<i>We're dead!</i>

29:35.525 --> 29:38.110
Oh, no! Dad's coming!

29:38.110 --> 29:40.070
What are we gonna do? Simon?

29:40.070 --> 29:43.741
<i>Simon had mastered the art of</i>
<i>a hasty retreat years ago.</i>

29:43.741 --> 29:46.327
<i>I stared at him in loathing</i>
<i>admiration as I noticed</i>

29:46.327 --> 29:49.038
<i>he had the presence of mind to</i>
<i>allow a rivulet of spittle</i>

29:49.038 --> 29:50.665
<i>drip down his chin.</i>

29:50.665 --> 29:53.209
<i>And then, I noticed John,</i>

29:53.209 --> 29:56.128
<i>sleeping like a sloth</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>

29:56.128 --> 29:57.838
[door opens]

30:11.644 --> 30:13.812
Did he stay asleep
the whole time?

30:24.782 --> 30:27.493
[chuckling]

30:27.493 --> 30:29.495
That's pretty cool.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.164
Just for the record,
it was my idea.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.084
Yeah, but it's still
pretty cool.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.465
Has anyone seen Rosie?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.469
Dad, Rosie's missing.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.138
I'm sure she'll turn
up somewhere, bud, okay?

30:48.138 --> 30:50.015
I bet she flew away.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.852
Why would she do that?
She loves me!

30:53.852 --> 30:57.064
Rosie, where are you, girl?

30:58.065 --> 31:03.446
And now, for
the pièce de résistance.

31:03.446 --> 31:07.700
Oh, wow, honey, you have really
outdone yourself this time.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.744
-Wow.
-Thanks, honey.

31:09.744 --> 31:11.328
Look at that.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.624
Whoah.

31:16.626 --> 31:19.754
Is that a store-bought chicken?

31:19.754 --> 31:22.840
Ummm...

31:23.841 --> 31:26.844
Is that... Rosie?

31:29.263 --> 31:32.141
Ralph, you didn't...

31:35.645 --> 31:38.147
No, I...

31:38.147 --> 31:40.023
Ralph...

31:43.694 --> 31:48.407
You know, all those chickens,
they all look alike.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.118
They're covered in feathers,
and it's not like

31:51.118 --> 31:54.747
they wear little name tags
or anything like that so...

31:54.747 --> 31:56.415
Peter, l-listen...

31:56.415 --> 31:58.000
<i>There are moments</i>
<i>in everyone's lives</i>

31:58.000 --> 31:59.794
<i>when the stars</i>
<i>fall out of alignment,</i>

31:59.794 --> 32:02.045
<i>and nothing seems right</i>
<i>with the world.</i>

32:02.045 --> 32:04.674
<i>This was one of those moments.</i>

32:04.674 --> 32:07.092
Rosie really looks
delicious right now,

32:07.092 --> 32:09.428
and if you look at her,

32:09.428 --> 32:14.517
I mean, it's almost as if she
is... asking you to eat her,

32:14.517 --> 32:16.602
You could have your pick of
piece, you could have

32:16.602 --> 32:19.563
whichever piece you want.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.984
She looks more beautiful
now than she did then.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.569
[exasperated sigh]

32:25.569 --> 32:28.364
<i>We ate the potatoes,</i>
<i>the stuffing, the rolls,</i>

32:28.364 --> 32:30.407
<i>and the pumpkin pie.</i>

32:30.407 --> 32:34.244
<i>But Rosie</i>
<i>remained unconsumed.</i>

33:00.020 --> 33:02.189
[crying]

33:05.943 --> 33:08.779
Who's for breakfast, Farding?

33:10.447 --> 33:14.368
<i>Mom's favorite platter lies</i>
<i>under the ground to this day.</i>

33:14.368 --> 33:17.204
[talking like pirates]

33:17.204 --> 33:20.499
-Dad! Dad!
-DAD: Who did this?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.084
<i>My heart sank.</i>

33:22.084 --> 33:23.669
<i>The Hagbarts</i>
<i>had plundered our ship.</i>

33:23.669 --> 33:25.629
<i>They pillaged our loot!</i>

33:25.629 --> 33:28.674
<i>It was time for revenge and</i>
<i>we would give them no quarter.</i>

33:28.674 --> 33:31.385
My sled is gone!

33:31.385 --> 33:34.847
Question is...

33:34.847 --> 33:37.015
how did they find our ship?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.229
You didn't bring someone here?

33:42.229 --> 33:43.856
Of course he didn't.

33:45.942 --> 33:47.276
Did you?

33:48.945 --> 33:52.281
I brought Juniper here.

33:52.281 --> 33:55.492
But I didn't know someone
would follow us and do this!

33:55.492 --> 33:57.954
You brought a girl... here?

33:57.954 --> 33:59.413
What about the Buckley code?

33:59.413 --> 34:01.916
Matthew, I am really
disappointed in you.

34:01.916 --> 34:04.668
-So am I.
-Me too.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.086
<i>I had to deflect attention.</i>

34:06.086 --> 34:09.547
Well, at least
I didn't kill Rosie.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.134
<i>I had seen Mom use this tactic</i>
<i>on Dad many times.</i>

34:12.134 --> 34:16.388
No. Wait-wait
just a minute here.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.933
You all had something
to do with this.

34:18.933 --> 34:23.520
You're all grounded,
going home now, grounded!

34:29.985 --> 34:32.154
I owe you guys an apology.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.284
I made a mistake,
and I'm sorry.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.329
We all do.

34:41.789 --> 34:44.166
Make mistakes, that is.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.337
I'm sorry, too, guys.

34:54.510 --> 34:57.471
<i>Christmas was</i>

<i>We were running out of time.</i>

35:04.520 --> 35:06.689
<i>Where was the catalog?</i>

35:07.773 --> 35:09.733
<i>Where did Simon hide it?</i>

Wait, why are we
going past Jay's?

35:31.213 --> 35:33.131
We're trying something
new this year, guys.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.092
ALL: New?

35:46.896 --> 35:50.273
Ugh. Not the Hagbarts.

Look who's coming.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.618
Hi, Finn.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.121
Prices are on the trees,
cash only.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.915
Perfect.

36:05.915 --> 36:08.751
<i>The Hagbarts' trees were not</i>
<i>like the ones on Jay's lot.</i>

<i>Jay's trees were tall</i>
<i>and strong-looking.</i>

36:11.253 --> 36:16.008
<i>These trees were straggly and</i>
<i>ugly, just like the Hagbarts.</i>

<i>My sled!</i>

Not anymore.
What's that?

36:33.776 --> 36:37.362
An angel; we're putting it on
our tree when we get home.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.866
Give that back!

36:40.866 --> 36:43.035
It's okay, he can look at it.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.412
Call this an angel?

36:45.412 --> 36:47.372
It's ugly as sin.

<i>-First the ship.</i>
-Whoops.

Listen, Finn.

37:07.851 --> 37:12.022
Here, we really wanna
take that, that tree.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.734
You paid way too much money.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.444
You know, I don't think so.

That tree is really
something special

37:20.363 --> 37:25.161
Thank you.

business?

38:31.601 --> 38:33.770
You've never gotten
a Christmas catalog before?

38:33.770 --> 38:36.190
A Christmas catalog?

38:36.190 --> 38:39.442
Of course,
only ours came twice a year.

38:39.442 --> 38:43.321
Hey, did I ever tell you that
I'm the champ at ping-pong?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.656
Nope.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.700
Wanna come over
later for a game?

38:46.700 --> 38:49.536
<i>Now I almost said no,</i>

38:49.536 --> 38:51.705
<i>that being best friends</i>
<i>with Alan</i>

<i>could have fringe benefits.</i>

54:03.908 --> 54:06.744
<i>I can't believe that</i>
<i>actually worked.</i>

54:06.744 --> 54:08.454
Wow!

54:08.454 --> 54:11.666
Looks like we have a winner.
Hey, everyone!

54:11.666 --> 54:15.003
<i>And I can't believe he</i>
<i>gets the credit again!</i>

54:15.003 --> 54:17.338
<i>What the... Alan!</i>

54:19.465 --> 54:21.676
Cheaters never prosper.

54:21.676 --> 54:23.803
Looks to me like they do.

54:27.473 --> 54:30.351
<i>Now we waited a few days for</i>
<i>the second night of elving.</i>

54:30.351 --> 54:32.436
<i>That's the Buckley</i>
<i>family secret.</i>

54:32.436 --> 54:34.897
<i>You never elve</i>
<i>two nights in a row.</i>

54:34.897 --> 54:37.859
<i>That way, they don't</i>
<i>know when you're coming.</i>

54:37.859 --> 54:41.362
<i>But I gotta admit,</i>
<i>I wasn't into it.</i>

54:46.325 --> 54:49.954
<i>This guy didn't deserve</i>
<i>moms cookies.</i>

54:49.954 --> 54:52.456
<i>He didn't even deserve</i>
<i>Monica's cookies.</i>

54:56.127 --> 54:57.712
Hah.

54:57.712 --> 55:01.298
<i>Now I had never seen</i>
<i>Finn that happy before.</i>

55:01.298 --> 55:03.342
<i>Could it be that under</i>
<i>all that dirt and bravado,</i>

55:03.342 --> 55:05.678
<i>he was a regular kid</i>
<i>like me?</i>

55:05.678 --> 55:09.140
<i>Naaah.</i>

55:09.140 --> 55:11.893
[whistling]

55:11.893 --> 55:14.729
Hey, boys, nothing today.

55:15.980 --> 55:19.025
Are you ever gonna
bring that catalog?

55:19.025 --> 55:22.153
I did, I put it in
the mail a few days ago.

55:22.153 --> 55:24.197
But we didn't get it.

55:24.197 --> 55:27.992
Well, somebody did.

55:27.992 --> 55:30.327
We'll see, uh... we'll see
you two tomorrow.

55:33.873 --> 55:35.291
Simon!

55:35.291 --> 55:38.711
<i>This was the best job</i>
<i>Simon's ever done</i>

55:38.711 --> 55:40.546
<i>at hiding the catalog.</i>

55:44.341 --> 55:47.887
<i>Nope, not where</i>
<i>it was last year.</i>

55:58.273 --> 56:01.234
<i>Oh! There's an idea.</i>

56:10.785 --> 56:12.536
Told ya so.

56:12.536 --> 56:14.789
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

56:21.045 --> 56:27.009
Finn, that is so thoughtful
of you, thank you.

56:27.009 --> 56:29.053
Thanks.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.221
Uh.

56:30.221 --> 56:32.974
Eww, ohh.

56:32.974 --> 56:35.017
Is this some kind of a joke?

56:35.017 --> 56:37.228
No, I mean, uh...

56:37.228 --> 56:38.313
Toothpaste?

56:38.313 --> 56:39.688
<i>With fluoride.</i>

56:39.688 --> 56:43.818
I didn't, I-I wouldn't.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.404
I'm seriously disappointed
in you, Finn.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.865
You're staying after
school today.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.617
He can't stay after school.

56:51.617 --> 56:54.036
He has to take care of
take care of little Francie.

56:57.539 --> 56:59.583
Take your seat, Finn.

57:00.793 --> 57:03.045
Go on.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.968
Dad's gonna be
mad if you're late.

57:08.968 --> 57:11.428
Don't you think
I know that?

57:15.350 --> 57:16.725
Two words.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.602
Okay.

57:21.189 --> 57:22.857
Matthew Buckley.

57:25.693 --> 57:28.988
Christmas catalog.

57:28.988 --> 57:31.407
Who stole your candy
and ate it?

57:31.407 --> 57:35.286
He feels bad about playing
that trick on Finn Hagbart.

57:35.286 --> 57:38.080
<i>How did he know that?</i>
<i>I didn't even know that.</i>

57:38.080 --> 57:39.748
You're full of it.

57:39.748 --> 57:42.377
But you got a weird
feeling right here, huh?

57:44.962 --> 57:48.507
I read minds,
can't control it.

57:48.507 --> 57:52.387
Finn Hagbart had that coming,
he broke my glasses.

57:52.387 --> 57:55.390
Yeah, and he stole your sled!

57:55.390 --> 57:57.933
They busted our ship,
for Pete's sake!

57:57.933 --> 57:59.727
For my sake?

57:59.727 --> 58:03.564
You saw John's face when
they wrecked his angel.

58:03.564 --> 58:06.984
Just because
we have to elve the Hagbarts,

58:06.984 --> 58:10.612
doesn't mean we have to
like it, or them.

58:10.612 --> 58:15.034
<i>I did it, I won.</i>

58:15.034 --> 58:18.871
<i>So why did I feel</i>
<i>so bad inside?</i>

58:23.500 --> 58:25.502
Thought I'd find you here.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.882
Can I join ya?

58:40.351 --> 58:44.272
I ever tell you
about Tony Pickney?

58:44.272 --> 58:49.651
He used to beat me up
every day after school.

58:49.651 --> 58:51.570
Every day.

58:51.570 --> 58:52.905
Well, not every day.

58:52.905 --> 58:54.823
He was sick
every now and then, but.

58:58.202 --> 59:00.371
If you need me
to step in on this...

59:00.371 --> 59:03.707
No, I've got this.

59:11.966 --> 59:14.593
Did I ever tell you about
Susan Smallform?

59:14.593 --> 59:16.595
You had a girlfriend
before Mom?

59:16.595 --> 59:20.557
Oh, yeah, I was quite the catch
back in sixth grade.

59:21.809 --> 59:25.980
Of course, she, she
dumped me for Tony Pickney.

59:28.441 --> 59:32.111
But then, then I met
your mom.

59:34.947 --> 59:37.408
She was my first real kiss.

59:37.408 --> 59:41.496
School auditorium, wrapped
up in the curtains.

59:44.165 --> 59:47.001
It was awesome.

59:47.001 --> 59:49.545
I think I knew she
was the one back then.

59:49.545 --> 59:51.588
It took, definitely
took a while

59:51.588 --> 59:54.758
to convince her of
that, but, uh,

59:54.758 --> 59:57.136
but eventually,
it all works out.

59:59.472 --> 01:00:01.474
What do you say
we get to work?

01:00:03.184 --> 01:00:06.979
<i>That was my first talk that was</i>
<i>man-to-man with my dad.</i>

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.443
<i>He's been my best friend</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:16.655
Have a good day kids, stay
safe, have a good day, Gene.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.287
Simon said
you were in Vietnam.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:26.165
That's right, I was.

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.168
Did you have to fight a lot?

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:32.713
I did what I had to,
I didn't like it.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.967
You have to know what's worth
fighting for, Matthew.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.844
Aggression?

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:42.139
Aggression will win a battle.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.434
But only love will end war.

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:48.937
[school bell rings]

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.106
Bell rang, go on.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.406
<i>On the third night of elving,</i>

01:00:58.406 --> 01:00:59.865
<i>Mom was having</i>
<i>contractions again,</i>

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:02.368
<i>so Dad took her</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:05.746
<i>but Monica offered</i>
<i>to drive us.</i>

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:07.582
<i>We quickly made her recite</i>
<i>the elving pledge,</i>

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.041
<i>and we were ready</i>
<i>to go.</i>

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.959
This is our solemn pledge.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.048
Where's Juniper?

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.466
She's busy.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:20.761
-Doing what?
-Do you want a ride or not?

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.901
Does she always drive
this slow?

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:38.404
Yeah, she flunked Drivers Ed.

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:40.906
I can't concentrate with
all this noise going on!

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:45.869
Alright, that's better.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.587
What?

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.882
What!?

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.842
Be prepared.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.262
That's what I learned
when I got my eagle.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.893
This is gonna be fun!

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.396
Uh, Pete and Johnny boy
gotta stay in the car.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.232
-Parental orders.
-What! No fair!

in the car too,

about it? No.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.436
Okay, so they're gonna be
watching for us this time.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.188
So we'll need
to look out, okay?

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:55.439
Alright.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.486
Looks like no one's home.

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:08.160
No, they're home.
Simon, you go over there,

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.871
and if they see us,
you can distract.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.789
Okay, got it.

I goofed up, didn't I?

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:50.244
It's fine.
It happens to all of us.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.584
Pretty sure Simon
has the catalog.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:04:01.630
Really?
What makes you say that?

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:03.632
Well...

Morris said he brought it
a few days ago.

I've been doing?

Everything's great.

Where is the catalog?

01:06:11.844 --> 01:06:13.846
I know you have it.

01:06:13.846 --> 01:06:16.139
Where is it?
I need it.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:22.437
That's for me to know and you
to find out, capisce?

I have a little
surprise for you.

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:09.067
I have arranged for our class to
become pen pals with someone

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.903
from someplace
very special.

01:07:10.903 --> 01:07:13.906

this place is famous for?

<i>it didn't matter.</i>

<i>Finn Hagbart</i>
<i>made sure everyone</i>

<i>in the school</i>
<i>thought they were mine,</i>

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:36.011
<i>and there was no point</i>
<i>in trying to deny it.</i>

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.430
<i>Then, Alan sealed the deal.</i>

Don't feel bad, the kids
at my old school

every day, even in the summer.

who the culprit is,

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:15.580
Why?

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:20.126

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.689
Merry Christmas, Matthew.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:47.648
Merry Christmas.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:50.902
<i>Yep, angels are real.</i>

01:23:50.902 --> 01:23:52.612
<i>I've met one.</i>

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:05.124
Guys! Santa time!

01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:14.508
[kids giggling]

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:17.303
Come on! Go!

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:30.065
Santa said he likes my angel.

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:32.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let me see that!

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:35.488
MONICA:
Keep the racket down!

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.836
-Where's Mom and Dad?
-The baby came.

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.964
Is it a boy or a girl?

01:24:52.964 --> 01:24:55.008
Uh-huh.

01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:56.676
Which one?

01:24:56.676 --> 01:24:59.178
Well, why don't we find
out, huh?

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.806
You're home? Already?

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:04.475
Wasn't gonna miss Christmas
morning with my boys.

01:25:04.475 --> 01:25:06.811
She actually bribed
the doctor

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:09.563
to get her to come home early.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:13.442
Boys, I want you
to meet Mary...

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.862
Noel...

01:25:15.862 --> 01:25:18.280
Buckley.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.240
She's beautiful.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.409
-She's so teeny.
-[laughing]

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.411
I guess I'm not
the baby anymore.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.205
Oh, honey.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.999
Can I hold her?

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:42.722
Welcome to the team,
little sister.

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.987
Merry Christmas,
Buckley brothers.

01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:01.824
Do you wanna come over
to my house

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.534
and see what I got
for Christmas?

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:12.209
I'm... opening my stocking
with Simon.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:13.794
Okay.

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:16.714
<i>Now I know it looks like</i>
<i>I just blew her off,</i>

01:26:16.714 --> 01:26:19.550
<i>but I promise, I made it</i>
<i>up to her 15 years later</i>

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:21.844
<i>when I asked her</i>
<i>to marry me.</i>

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:23.512
<i>On that Christmas morning,</i>

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.098
<i>I wanted to spend it</i>
<i>with just us,</i>

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:26.599
<i>the Buckley brothers.</i>

01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:30.269
<i>-Oh, and little Mary.</i>
-[car approaching]

01:26:39.779 --> 01:26:41.781
Hey, Matthew.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:47.411
We're going to live
with our grandma.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:55.628
We got a new sled for
Christmas, so, uh...

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:58.380
We don't need
this pile of junk anymore.

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:01.508
Thanks, Finn.

01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:05.638
My dad's waiting for me.

01:27:12.145 --> 01:27:13.395
See you later, Matthew.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.355
[car starts]

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:19.735
<i>And suddenly,</i>
<i>there was peace on Earth,</i>

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:22.155
<i>and good will toward men.</i>

01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:24.949
<i>At least</i>
<i>in our neighborhood.</i>

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.726
What are you looking at!?

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:54.269
Scram!

01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:00.776
<i>Huh.</i>
<i>That didn't last long.</i>

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:05.865
<i>And you'll never guess who Mom</i>
<i>decided to elve next Christmas.</i>
