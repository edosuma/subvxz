WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.379
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:02.587 --> 00:03.964
You know that SoDale contract?

00:04.172 --> 00:05.674
It was awarded
to Andrews Construction.

00:05.882 --> 00:07.968
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know
that Daddy is the buyer?

00:08.176 --> 00:10.762
I asked around
about those bruisers
going after your crew.

00:10.971 --> 00:13.682
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.266
Hiram, why would he even...

00:15.475 --> 00:18.019
Maybe he got a whiff
of your little romance
with Freddy Andrews?

00:18.228 --> 00:19.729
When my father got arrested,

00:19.938 --> 00:21.564
I made a pact to become
a better person.

00:21.773 --> 00:23.984
You're the bravest
of them all, Ethel Muggs.

00:24.359 --> 00:26.111
You hate the Blossoms

00:26.319 --> 00:28.405
<i>and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.</i>

00:28.613 --> 00:29.864
Polly is moving home.

00:30.073 --> 00:35.495
I will not be party
to raising a child
that has Blossom blood.

00:36.788 --> 00:37.998
<i>Thicker than blood.</i>

00:38.206 --> 00:39.666
<i>More precious than oil.</i>

00:40.208 --> 00:43.086
<i>Riverdale's big business
is maple syrup.</i>

00:43.294 --> 00:44.838
<i>Since the town's founding,</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:48.133
<i>one family has controlled
its lucrative syrup trade,</i>

00:48.341 --> 00:49.718
<i>the Blossoms.</i>

00:49.926 --> 00:52.095
<i>They were a part of the fabric
of our daily lives...</i>

00:52.303 --> 00:54.723
<i>Rich or poor, old or young,</i>

00:54.931 --> 00:57.642
<i>we consumed Blossom syrup
by the bucket.</i>

00:57.851 --> 01:01.312
<i>That sickly, sweet smell
was inescapable.</i>

01:04.107 --> 01:07.110
<i>The death of Jason Blossom
precipitated a crisis.</i>

01:07.318 --> 01:09.070
<i>With the heir apparent gone,</i>

01:09.279 --> 01:12.073
<i>who would inherit
the family business one day?</i>

01:12.407 --> 01:13.950
<i>Certainly not Cheryl.</i>

01:15.869 --> 01:18.830
<i>It was a question that brought
the wolves to Riverdale.</i>

01:19.039 --> 01:21.207
<i>And now, the Blossoms
were circling the wagons</i>

01:21.416 --> 01:22.667
<i>against possible attack,</i>

01:23.334 --> 01:24.878
<i>from within their own ranks.</i>

01:25.086 --> 01:28.256
<i>Polly won't answer
my calls or e-mails.</i>

01:28.423 --> 01:30.550
I mean, I get that she doesn't
want to talk to my dad,

01:30.759 --> 01:32.677
but what did I do wrong?

01:32.886 --> 01:33.636
Nothing.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.014
We'll figure it out.

01:36.973 --> 01:37.766
Come here.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.437
Up and at 'em,
breakfast is ready.

01:42.645 --> 01:43.688
I'm not hungry.

01:43.897 --> 01:45.440
Oh, enough is enough,
Elizabeth,

01:45.648 --> 01:46.816
we have a big week
ahead of us.

01:47.484 --> 01:50.153
The Blossoms have always been
a thorn in our side,

01:50.361 --> 01:52.781
ever since, according
to your milquetoast father,

01:52.989 --> 01:54.282
Great-Grandpappy Blossom

01:54.491 --> 01:56.493
killed
Great-Grandpappy Cooper.

01:56.701 --> 01:59.621
Well, it's about time
someone brings them to heel.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.416
I'm writing a searing,
no-holds-barred
takedown of their clan.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.752
And you think that's going
to bring Polly home?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.587
Maybe, maybe not,

02:07.796 --> 02:09.005
but it'll make me feel better.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.050
Word has it that
the Blossom board of trustees

02:12.258 --> 02:15.595
has descended upon Riverdale
like a cabal of vampires.

02:15.804 --> 02:17.931
Why? Now, that's a story.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.224
I just need to find a way in.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.103
The lawyers
are coming over this week

02:23.311 --> 02:25.230
to take our statements
for your dad's hearing.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.608
We're both gonna
have to testify on
your father's behalf.

02:28.817 --> 02:31.945
What if they ask
about what he did?

02:32.737 --> 02:34.155
Embezzling all that money?

02:34.864 --> 02:36.116
Am I going to have to lie?

02:36.991 --> 02:40.411
Well...
We might have to

02:40.620 --> 02:42.580
shade the truth a bit,
Ronnie.

02:45.375 --> 02:46.417
Mom?

02:47.252 --> 02:49.587
Baby, I have just made
a mess of things.

02:51.256 --> 02:53.550
Your father found out
about Fred and me.

02:54.551 --> 02:55.802
Someone went to him

02:56.010 --> 02:57.220
before I got a chance
to say anything...

02:57.428 --> 02:59.264
Oh, my God, Dad knows?

02:59.472 --> 03:00.640
Yes, and on top of that,

03:00.849 --> 03:02.976
the Blossoms are still
after the drive-in land,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.687
and Fred still doesn't know
that we own it.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.607
Maybe it's time you tell
Mr. Andrews the truth.

03:09.816 --> 03:12.193
And risk having him
walk off the project?

03:12.402 --> 03:15.363
We've bet everything we have
on the SoDale construction.

03:15.572 --> 03:16.823
Mom,

03:17.031 --> 03:19.117
this is a small, gossipy town.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.244
You need to tell Fred
about the land

03:21.452 --> 03:23.121
before someone else does.

03:30.003 --> 03:30.712
Archie.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.506
If music be the food of love,

03:33.715 --> 03:35.592
play on, play on.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.513
Did you know
this week's
the official start

03:40.722 --> 03:41.973
of maple syrup season?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.184
I... No, I didn't.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.269
Well, it is.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.813
And every year, we host
a tree-tapping ceremony,

03:49.022 --> 03:51.399
a tradition that honors
the Blossom bloodline.

03:51.608 --> 03:52.525
Our heritage.

03:53.318 --> 03:54.194
Sounds cool.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.987
It is. Beyond.

03:56.196 --> 03:59.407
It's also
incredibly exclusive.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.826
Family and inner circle only.

04:02.869 --> 04:04.245
Wanna be my date?

04:06.080 --> 04:10.043
The maple-tapping's something
Jason and I have done together
since we could walk.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.794
It was our
extra-special thing.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.422
But I...

04:14.797 --> 04:16.466
I can't face it alone.

04:17.592 --> 04:19.093
If you came,

04:19.302 --> 04:20.845
as my escort,

04:21.054 --> 04:23.473
I think
I could get through it.

04:25.183 --> 04:28.144
Cheryl, I would love to help,
but I have a girlfriend.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.647
Maybe invite Kevin? Or Reggie?

04:30.855 --> 04:32.690
You don't get it, do you?

04:32.899 --> 04:35.235
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.527
I want you.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.030
You defended me
to Sheriff Keller

04:39.239 --> 04:40.990
when not even
my parents would.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.245
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.788
Cheryl, hold on.

04:49.249 --> 04:54.170
"They put me in a wooden box
as I desperately opposed.

04:56.089 --> 04:57.757
"But all my screaming
was for naught.

04:57.966 --> 04:59.884
"My mouth had been
sewn closed.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.930
"Curled up in bed
was just a girl.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.766
"Needing Daddy's arms
to hold her."

05:09.936 --> 05:11.020
Hey, Ethel.

05:12.647 --> 05:16.859
I just wanted to tell you
how moved I was by your poem.

05:17.652 --> 05:20.488
It felt like you were tapping
into something pretty dark,

05:20.697 --> 05:22.907
but also pretty real.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.660
And I don't want
to overstep...

05:26.494 --> 05:29.038
But is everything
all right, Ethel?

05:36.337 --> 05:38.631
Things at home
aren't great.

05:41.426 --> 05:43.011
My mom and dad are fighting,

05:44.178 --> 05:45.805
but they won't tell me
about what.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.852
It's like this really
bad thing is happening,

05:51.060 --> 05:53.104
and there's nothing that
I can do to stop it.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.648
Like you're trapped
in a slow-motion car crash.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.484
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.236
Listen, Ethel.

06:01.237 --> 06:03.489
It sounds like you
need some cheering up.

06:03.698 --> 06:06.659
Which happens to be
a Veronica Lodge specialty.

06:06.868 --> 06:07.744
So...

06:07.952 --> 06:09.787
If you're free tomorrow,

06:09.996 --> 06:11.789
come over for lunch
and pampering.

06:13.499 --> 06:14.375
Kevin will be there.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.337
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.088
Just please say yes.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.966
All right, sure.

06:22.175 --> 06:23.676
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.595
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.098
So... What was
that about?

06:30.683 --> 06:32.310
Ethel's poem
was a cry for help

06:32.518 --> 06:33.436
if I ever heard one,

06:33.644 --> 06:35.855
the likes of which
I vowed never to ignore,

06:36.064 --> 06:37.106
not after...

06:38.066 --> 06:39.650
Uh-oh. Do we need to sit down?

06:40.860 --> 06:43.029
Okay, so, last year at Spence,

06:43.237 --> 06:47.408
my best friend
Katy and I kind of
terrorized this girl, Paige.

06:47.617 --> 06:49.535
One time, we made her
drink gutter water.

06:49.744 --> 06:51.037
Ew! Why?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.747
Because she was there.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.040
Because she was a misfit

06:54.248 --> 06:56.042
and we were class-A
brutal bitches.

06:56.918 --> 06:57.960
Anyway, by December,

06:58.169 --> 06:59.504
Paige couldn't take it
anymore...

06:59.712 --> 07:02.048
Oh, my God,
did you drive her to suicide?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.257
What? No.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.218
But she did transfer schools.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.552
And went into therapy.

07:06.761 --> 07:07.595
So now?

07:07.804 --> 07:10.640
If I can make
Ethel Muggs' life
a little better,

07:10.848 --> 07:12.517
even for one afternoon,

07:13.184 --> 07:14.852
I'm going to do it.

07:18.398 --> 07:19.482
Archibald.

07:20.108 --> 07:22.485
I was going to get
Principal Weatherbee
to summon you.

07:23.027 --> 07:24.404
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.613
Have a moment to chat?

07:26.197 --> 07:27.240
About Cheryl.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.243
I believe she invited you
to our tree-tapping ceremony?

07:30.451 --> 07:31.244
Yeah.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.371
She did, and like I told her,

07:33.579 --> 07:35.456
I don't feel
comfortable going.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.834
Cheryl tells me

07:38.042 --> 07:40.420
you have a keen
interest in music.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.587
Is that true?

07:43.923 --> 07:46.134
Did she tell you
her Great-Uncle Harrison

07:46.342 --> 07:48.845
sits on the board of
the Brandenburg Music Academy?

07:49.804 --> 07:51.973
They have an excellent
summer program, I hear.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.435
It's amazing,
crazy hard to get into.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.979
Surely not for
a talent like you.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.898
And especially not
if I put in a word
on your behalf.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.316
Mrs. Blossom...

08:02.525 --> 08:04.110
At Jason's memorial,

08:04.318 --> 08:06.237
you brought me
his football jersey.

08:06.446 --> 08:08.114
So sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Blossom.

08:09.824 --> 08:11.701
I thought you might
want to have this.

08:14.954 --> 08:16.789
That was an act of kindness

08:16.998 --> 08:18.458
on a day of despair.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.085
You're good and decent,
Archibald,

08:21.294 --> 08:23.087
unlike most
people in this town.

08:23.713 --> 08:25.256
Mrs. Blossom,
I don't know what to say.

08:25.465 --> 08:29.010
Say you'll reconsider
escorting my daughter
to the tapping.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.803
It's just an afternoon.

08:31.012 --> 08:32.972
And it would mean the world
to my Cheryl.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.102
I mean, yeah. I guess
I could talk to Valerie.

08:38.311 --> 08:39.479
I swear, Archibald,

08:39.687 --> 08:41.063
when the light hits you
just right...

08:43.483 --> 08:45.318
I'll tell Cheryl
the good news.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.445
And I'll call
Great-Uncle Harrison.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.867
Just in time,
we're celebrating.

08:53.075 --> 08:53.993
Archie was just telling us

08:54.202 --> 08:57.079
how he's going to some
super-exclusive music program
this summer.

08:57.288 --> 08:59.540
Maybe. If it happens, though,
it would be huge for me.

08:59.749 --> 09:00.791
Do you have
to audition for it?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.835
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier

09:03.044 --> 09:04.462
and said she'd put
a good word in for me.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.755
Amazing.
Terrifying.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.090
Uh-huh.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.425
What's she getting out of it?

09:09.967 --> 09:11.427
I told her I'd take Cheryl

09:11.636 --> 09:13.095
to their family's
tree-tapping thing.

09:13.304 --> 09:14.764
I already talked to Valerie,
and she's cool with it.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.349
Cool with you
being a gigolo now?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.559
I'm doing someone
a favor for my music, Jughead.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.937
I need to make connections
outside of Riverdale.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.271
That's the way of the world.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.356
It's all about connections.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.191
But Jughead's right.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.360
These kinds of favors
always come with a price tag.

09:28.236 --> 09:29.529
Betty, back me up here.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.531
I think it's a great idea.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.740
Thank you, Betty.

09:32.949 --> 09:34.534
Yeah, and while you're there,

09:35.201 --> 09:37.328
would you talk
to Polly for me?

09:37.537 --> 09:39.330
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

09:40.289 --> 09:41.332
Definitely.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.084
Thank you.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.671
And don't worry, Ronnie,
I can take care of myself.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.631
Famous last words, Archiekins.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.810
When Jason died,

10:01.018 --> 10:02.770
I thought I'd tapped
my last tree.

10:02.979 --> 10:04.063
Now, don't be nervous.

10:04.272 --> 10:05.481
All you have to do
is hold the bucket steady,

10:05.690 --> 10:06.899
I'll handle the rest.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.402
Who are all these people?

10:09.610 --> 10:10.528
<i>Entre nous,</i>

10:10.736 --> 10:12.488
they're Daddy's
board of trustees.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.115
They smell blood
in the water.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.575
That's why they're here.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.786
They're worried
Daddy's losing his grip
on the company

10:18.953 --> 10:21.038
and they're looking for a way
to take it away from us.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.582
They can do that?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.500
If they all vote together,
they can.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.461
When Jason died,
it was a PR debacle.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.423
And now, here's Polly,
pregnant and unwed.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.841
It's no wonder
they've descended upon us

10:32.049 --> 10:33.384
like some biblical plague.

10:39.181 --> 10:43.936
"Nearly 100 years ago,
Grandfather Blossom came
to this sacred maple grove.

10:44.145 --> 10:46.230
"The annual tapping ceremony

10:46.439 --> 10:48.649
"portends each
season's bounty."

10:49.900 --> 10:53.362
Now, I've performed
this ceremony
many times in my life.

10:53.571 --> 10:56.407
My son Jason,
when he came of age,
performed it as well.

10:57.408 --> 10:58.659
In his place,

10:58.868 --> 11:00.661
I put forth
my daughter Cheryl.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.512
Hey.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.223
You can do this in your sleep.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.193
- Bravo!
- Well done!

11:37.573 --> 11:39.200
Good shot. Nice.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.828
Mrs. Lodge,
this Quiche Lorraine
is to die for.

11:43.579 --> 11:44.538
Ethel,

11:44.747 --> 11:45.623
you haven't eaten at all.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.291
Oh. Sorry. I just...

11:47.500 --> 11:48.584
I'm not really hungry.

11:48.793 --> 11:50.503
Anything we can help with?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.214
Uh, my parents...

11:54.423 --> 11:56.425
All they do is
yell at each other.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.428
My parents are fighting
right now, too.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.889
It's terrible.

12:03.641 --> 12:05.976
I think my dad had some
bad luck with our savings.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.855
Now my mom says
we're going to have
to sell the house.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.732
My dad is just so...

12:12.650 --> 12:13.818
Crushed.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.320
I wish there was something
I could do to help him.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.156
Girl, we have a lot more
in common than I thought.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.451
We lost our place
at the Dakota.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.247
Look, being ruined sucks.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.125
But you have your family
and you have us.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.127
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.

12:32.962 --> 12:34.130
"Muggs"?

12:34.964 --> 12:36.340
Uh, it's Dutch.

12:36.549 --> 12:37.633
We lost the third "G"

12:37.842 --> 12:39.593
when my Grandpa Manfred
came over.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.973
Archibald! Come join us
before the snow starts again.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.192
Polly.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.027
Betty's worried about you.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.571
Why won't you call
or e-mail her?

12:59.488 --> 13:00.656
She fought for you, Polly,

13:00.823 --> 13:02.575
and now you're treating her
like she's the enemy.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.910
Polly, come along.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.331
Tell Betty that
she shouldn't worry, okay?

13:12.334 --> 13:13.502
Veronica, there's something
that you need to know

13:13.711 --> 13:15.671
about that Muggs girl.
What?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.465
Her father, Manfred Muggs,

13:17.673 --> 13:18.924
invested with your dad.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.552
And it's probable
that they lost a lot

13:21.761 --> 13:24.430
when your father
was arrested.
Maybe everything.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.474
Mom, they're being kicked out
of their house,

13:26.682 --> 13:27.558
their home.

13:27.767 --> 13:28.893
Well, from what
I've been told,

13:29.101 --> 13:30.186
the Muggs family is going
to testify

13:30.394 --> 13:31.312
against your father.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.396
They should.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.440
How many, Mom?

13:35.149 --> 13:36.859
How many families
like Ethel's?

13:37.777 --> 13:40.321
It's the risk
of doing business
with your father.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.406
Could Mr. Andrews lose
everything,

13:43.407 --> 13:44.825
for doing business
with you and Dad?

13:45.034 --> 13:46.202
I'm not sure.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.579
My God.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.591
I don't buy this
dog-and-pony show
for a second.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.176
Cliff can't control
his own family,

14:02.384 --> 14:03.260
let alone the company.

14:03.469 --> 14:04.386
Agreed.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.056
And if he tries
to put Cheryl forward
as a successor...

14:07.264 --> 14:08.891
Do you remember what she did
at the funeral?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.601
Crocodile tears.
Hey.

14:10.810 --> 14:11.769
Archie,
you don't have to.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.646
No, Cheryl loved Jason.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.565
What was she meant to do
at his funeral, not cry?

14:16.774 --> 14:18.192
And yeah, Jason
was on the football team,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.194
but Cheryl was at
every single game, too,

14:20.402 --> 14:22.154
doing as much to help
the Bulldogs win as he did.

14:22.363 --> 14:23.572
Also, 4.0.

14:23.781 --> 14:25.866
Also, she has
a 4.0 grade point average.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.202
If there's one thing
that I've learned
being in Cheryl's class,

14:28.410 --> 14:30.246
it's don't underestimate her

14:30.955 --> 14:32.081
and don't bet against her.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.464
Fred, we need to talk.

14:42.550 --> 14:44.093
Oh, God.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.222
Hiram and I,

14:49.265 --> 14:51.600
we are the anonymous buyers.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.105
You're working
for Lodge Industries.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.440
How do you not tell me that?

14:59.316 --> 15:00.734
You never would
have gotten involved.

15:00.901 --> 15:01.902
You're damn straight.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.028
Because I didn't sign up

15:03.237 --> 15:05.614
to go into business
with a criminal
like Hiram Lodge.

15:05.823 --> 15:09.076
I'm trying to turn
Lodge Industries legitimate.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.787
That means partnering
with people like you,

15:11.996 --> 15:13.706
good people.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.835
This is why Cliff Blossom
bought out my crew?

15:19.003 --> 15:21.130
Sent thugs
to beat up teenagers?

15:22.464 --> 15:24.425
Clifford didn't send
those thugs.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.927
Hiram did.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.555
He was trying to stop us.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.433
He found out
about you and me
from Clifford.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.435
So you have
dragged me into a war

15:34.643 --> 15:37.313
between Hiram and Clifford,
that's great.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.981
I know you're angry.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.191
And I know that I have
no right to ask this...

15:42.651 --> 15:44.987
But please
stay on this project.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.281
If you jump ship,
I can't start over
with someone else.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.991
So, I do the grunt work

15:49.199 --> 15:50.659
while your husband's
taking potshots at me

15:50.868 --> 15:52.578
and you're playing both sides?

15:52.786 --> 15:53.704
The whole time?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.248
I gotta take a walk.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.463
Archibald, do you know,
when Cheryl told me

16:02.630 --> 16:04.089
that she wanted you
to come with us,

16:04.298 --> 16:05.883
I was a little taken aback.

16:07.551 --> 16:10.095
Your father and I haven't been
seeing eye-to-eye lately.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.139
I came for Cheryl,
Mr. Blossom.

16:12.348 --> 16:14.016
And because I'm grateful
for what Mrs. Blossom
is doing for me.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.143
The music academy, you mean?

16:16.352 --> 16:18.771
Yeah, that would be quite
a feather in your cap,
now, wouldn't it?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.357
You know, we can be
extremely generous,

16:21.565 --> 16:23.776
Archibald,
to the right people.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.154
Now later this week,
we're hosting
a banquet for the board

16:27.363 --> 16:28.656
at the Belmont Lodge.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.282
It's a simple thing,
a little dinner,

16:30.491 --> 16:32.117
chit-chat, dancing.

16:32.326 --> 16:35.162
We would love you to attend
as Cheryl's escort.

16:35.371 --> 16:36.956
You two make quite the pair.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.668
Oh, I'm honored,
Mr. Blossom, really, but...

16:40.876 --> 16:42.252
But nothing.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.214
You have to come,
I'm wearing viridian.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.924
He'll need a proper suit,
don't you think, Daddy?

16:47.132 --> 16:48.258
I'll have my tailor fit you.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.303
If that's not
a problem?

16:54.098 --> 16:56.517
No. No, no, it's just...

16:56.725 --> 16:58.602
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom,
like you said.

16:58.811 --> 17:00.646
My dad works construction,

17:00.854 --> 17:03.107
a fancy banquet's
not really our thing.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.858
That's precisely
why you should come.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.070
People like you
are the bedrock of our town.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.364
You're hard workers.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.908
Plus, I need a dance partner.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.494
We won't take no
for an answer...

17:17.329 --> 17:18.539
Archiekins.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.842
Who would've
predicted this?

17:30.050 --> 17:33.220
Archie Andrews
is our fox in the henhouse.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.888
Tell us about Polly.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.849
How is she? Did she seem okay?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.475
The Blossoms
are treating her great.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.352
But, Betty, I don't think
she's coming back.

17:40.561 --> 17:41.895
I don't think she wants to.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.815
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.

17:45.024 --> 17:46.608
She made her choice.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.236
We have to learn
to live with that.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.406
No. I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.116
Something else is going on.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.617
What else
did you see, Archie?

17:55.826 --> 17:57.786
When you were in
the sticky, red thick of it?

17:57.995 --> 17:59.329
Anything about the board?

17:59.538 --> 18:01.081
Cheryl said that
they're worried...

18:01.790 --> 18:04.376
That after all the scandal
with Jason and Polly,

18:05.085 --> 18:07.921
that they might try and steal
the company from Mr. Blossom.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.340
Well, do you hear that, Betty?

18:10.549 --> 18:13.719
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.

18:14.178 --> 18:16.305
No wonder
the trustees are in town.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.348
The Blossom empire
is crumbling.

18:18.557 --> 18:19.641
Okay, but, Mom,

18:19.850 --> 18:21.769
if you write a story
attacking them

18:21.977 --> 18:23.562
while Polly's
still in Thornhill...

18:23.771 --> 18:25.147
Enough about Polly.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.648
I mean it.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.900
She's the one
that betrayed us,

18:28.108 --> 18:29.151
not the other way around.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.238
Obviously she's jealous...

18:33.447 --> 18:34.448
Cheryl,

18:35.324 --> 18:36.325
can we have a word?

18:37.034 --> 18:38.994
Scatter, my Vixens.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.623
Yes, Betty? What is it?

18:43.957 --> 18:44.625
Polly.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.589
Look, I don't know what kind
of Stockholm syndrome
spell you've cast on her,

18:50.798 --> 18:52.466
but I want
to talk to my sister.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.510
Let's not fight.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.512
Especially not when
we should be celebrating.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.013
Why? What happened?

18:58.222 --> 18:59.223
Haven't you heard?

18:59.431 --> 19:01.433
Dr. Patel just
confirmed it
this morning.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.685
Polly is having twins.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.604
Bless our Blossom genes!

19:06.230 --> 19:07.898
And she didn't call
to tell me.

19:08.107 --> 19:09.525
Hostages aren't
normally allowed

19:09.733 --> 19:11.110
to make outgoing calls.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.487
Can you please just give her
a message for me?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.697
As long
as it doesn't upset her.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.658
Tell her she
should call our mom.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.160
She's trying really
hard to hide it,

19:20.369 --> 19:23.288
but I can tell she's really,
really hurt and upset.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.541
I'll pass your
message along...
Thank you.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.625
If I remember.

19:26.834 --> 19:27.709
Cheryl.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.586
That was a joke, you hobo.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.214
Of course I'll give her
your message, Betty.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.758
But no promises
that she'll care
or respond.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.055
<i>Okay, Ethel,</i>

19:40.264 --> 19:41.682
open your eyes.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.061
What is happening?

19:46.270 --> 19:47.563
I was purging my closet,

19:47.771 --> 19:49.815
thinking how you
would look magnificent

19:50.190 --> 19:51.358
in some of these.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.944
Here, try this on.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.032
This is... This is so nice.

19:59.241 --> 20:03.287
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.207
Ronnie, I can't take all this.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.042
I want you to have it.

20:10.669 --> 20:11.753
These things...

20:12.880 --> 20:14.506
My dad gave them to me.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.758
He always brought home gifts

20:16.967 --> 20:19.595
whenever he
did something wrong.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.765
As a way to
make up for it,
I guess.

20:24.141 --> 20:25.267
Did it work?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.937
What girl is immune
to the charms
of a Givenchy bag?

20:30.522 --> 20:32.733
And I still wear
these pearls he gave me.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.320
Okay, but...

20:36.528 --> 20:38.488
You don't have to do anything.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.657
Give me anything.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.327
I just want to be friends.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.872
Me, too, Ethel.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.088
Mr. Andrews! Nice haircut.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.382
You're looking extremely
DILF-y today.

20:57.841 --> 20:58.717
Is Archie home?

20:58.926 --> 21:00.636
Cheryl, yes.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.721
Um, come on in.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.726
The Ice Woman cometh.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.354
Hey, Cheryl.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.189
As a maj thank-you
for coming

21:12.397 --> 21:14.107
to the maple banquet
with me tomorrow,

21:14.900 --> 21:16.276
I wanted to give you this.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.404
An '84 Les Paul.

21:19.613 --> 21:20.614
In our signature color.

21:20.822 --> 21:21.782
You're welcome.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.954
Okay. That's all.
I'm going now.

21:27.162 --> 21:29.373
My claustrophobia acts up
in small houses.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.833
See you tomorrow.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.801
I'd give that back
if I were you.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.053
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms,

21:43.262 --> 21:44.888
they're helping me
get into that
summer music program.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.181
Like, the best in the country.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.474
And since
when did the Blossoms

21:47.683 --> 21:49.518
ever give a damn
about you, Archie?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.186
Well, they think
I have potential, Dad.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.563
He's also pimping himself
out to Cheryl.

21:53.772 --> 21:57.234
The Blossoms tried to run
our business into the ground.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.361
Maybe if you tried talking
to Mr. Blossom...

21:59.569 --> 22:00.862
I tried talking to him,
Archie,

22:01.071 --> 22:02.281
he laughed in my face.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.867
Don't think for a second
that the Blossoms
are looking out for you.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.286
They're using you, Archie.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.914
They look at us like
we're dirt under their shoe.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.667
I'm over it.

22:23.593 --> 22:24.761
What's this?

22:24.970 --> 22:26.930
The biggest story
we've ever broken.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.099
A tell-all expose
on the Blossom clan

22:29.308 --> 22:31.059
and all of their
glorious corruption.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.436
Um, would you mind telling me

22:32.644 --> 22:34.187
what your mother
is talking about?

22:34.396 --> 22:36.231
It's time that
they finally answer

22:36.440 --> 22:37.899
to everything
that they've done to us,

22:38.108 --> 22:39.609
including taking Polly.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.279
By the way, Polly's living
with the Blossoms now,

22:42.487 --> 22:44.990
so congratulations,
you've finally got
what you wanted.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.533
She's officially out
of our lives.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.870
I'm not publishing
your personal vendetta.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.956
Well, it's a good thing
I don't need your permission.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.299
What did you do, Hal?

23:02.507 --> 23:04.259
Well, you kicked me out.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.762
So, now, I'm kicking you out.

23:07.346 --> 23:10.515
If we expose
the Blossoms, maybe...

23:10.932 --> 23:13.435
Just maybe, we might
have a chance in hell

23:13.643 --> 23:14.811
to get our daughter back.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.064
You are done here,
Alice. You're fired.

23:21.860 --> 23:22.903
Fine, Hal.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.083
What?

23:41.296 --> 23:44.591
I want my daughter back,
you bastard!

23:51.098 --> 23:52.307
Mom!

23:59.773 --> 24:02.192
Black piping
for the velvet, of course.

24:02.401 --> 24:03.944
I'll take measurements
for the pants.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.404
Uh, before we do that...

24:07.614 --> 24:09.658
Could I talk to you,
Mr. Blossom?

24:17.124 --> 24:19.251
Things aren't going great
at my dad's company.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.587
And I know you two have
been at odds recently.

24:22.796 --> 24:26.174
But I was wondering,
instead of helping me
with that music school, if...

24:27.592 --> 24:29.719
Maybe you could
help my dad.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.763
Are you negotiating
on behalf of your father?

24:32.722 --> 24:35.142
No, no, I'm impressed.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.896
In fact, I'm trying to imagine
if Jason would ever have

24:40.105 --> 24:41.314
given up something
like that for me,

24:41.481 --> 24:42.649
and I don't believe so.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.610
It speaks to
your character, son.

24:46.695 --> 24:47.863
But I'll tell you what,

24:48.071 --> 24:49.823
we've already called
the Brandenburg Music Academy.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.616
And they're very excited
to meet you, by the way.

24:53.285 --> 24:55.454
Let's just get through
this banquet, all right?

24:55.662 --> 24:56.955
Sit down man-to-man

24:57.164 --> 24:59.374
and discuss what I can do
for Fred Andrews.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.419
Is it satisfactory?

25:05.464 --> 25:07.507
It's more than satisfactory.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.010
My parents
are unbelievable, Jug.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.636
Polly is locked up
in that house

25:11.845 --> 25:13.221
like a character
out of <i>Jane Eyre,</i>

25:13.430 --> 25:14.848
and what are they doing?

25:15.056 --> 25:16.725
Changing each other's
login accounts

25:16.933 --> 25:18.602
and throwing bricks
through windows.

25:18.810 --> 25:19.853
I wish I'd seen that.

25:22.189 --> 25:23.857
Okay, I'm sorry,
that's not funny.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.400
It's like, you know
how, in a time of crisis,

25:25.609 --> 25:28.195
people either come together
or fall apart?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.074
It feels like
we're falling apart.

25:34.075 --> 25:35.535
And the way things
are going, pretty soon,

25:35.744 --> 25:38.121
the Coopers, we're not gonna
exist anymore.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.915
And there's nothing
I can do to stop that.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.208
Betty, don't do that.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.334
Don't give up.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.879
Your family is definitely
splintering right now,

25:46.087 --> 25:48.256
but it won't fall apart,
because of you.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.842
Because you're holding
them together.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.054
You're so much stronger

25:54.262 --> 25:55.680
than all of the white noise.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.725
You're stronger
than your mother,

25:58.934 --> 26:00.352
you're stronger
than your father.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.688
You're holding
this family together.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.359
So don't.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.362
Don't let go.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.073
I won't.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.500
Valerie, hi.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.001
I thought you should know,

26:25.210 --> 26:26.836
Cheryl poured some
insane poison into my ear

26:27.045 --> 26:28.421
about how close
you two are getting.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.341
She legit thinks she's
going to steal you away
from me or something.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.927
No, she doesn't.
Yes, she does.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.762
And I don't blame her.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.723
The new guitar, the new suit?

26:39.891 --> 26:41.101
The Blossoms
are buying you.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.103
For one night,
if it helps my dad

26:43.270 --> 26:44.729
and gets me into
that music program...

26:44.938 --> 26:46.940
Wouldn't you rather earn
your place at that table?

26:47.148 --> 26:47.983
With your music?

26:48.191 --> 26:50.318
All the Blossoms are doing
is opening a door for me.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.112
What would you do
if you were in my place?

26:52.487 --> 26:53.947
If you have to ask,

26:54.155 --> 26:55.824
then you don't
know me at all, Archie.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.160
<i>Oh, my God,
did you hear?</i>

27:00.161 --> 27:01.788
Remember when you went
swooping in to save Ethel,

27:01.997 --> 27:04.249
'cause you thought
she might be suicidal?

27:05.292 --> 27:06.668
Oh, no. She didn't...

27:06.876 --> 27:08.670
No, but her dad did.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.715
He accidentally
swallowed a whole
bottle of sleeping pills.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.592
He's going to be okay,

27:13.800 --> 27:16.052
but that's why Ethel's
been so sad lately.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.178
Now, everybody knows...

27:54.507 --> 27:55.717
We were
tested this year.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.095
As a town, as a company,

27:59.721 --> 28:00.889
mainly as a family.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.141
And it may not have
been Jason's hand

28:03.350 --> 28:05.435
that staked
the maple this year,

28:06.770 --> 28:08.021
but it was the hand of hope.

28:17.822 --> 28:20.116
Don't think they're
being nice or genuine.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.410
They wanted me to fail
at the tree-tapping.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.705
But you're going to help
with all that.

28:25.914 --> 28:26.998
I'll do whatever I can.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.418
Archibald, have a word?

28:31.503 --> 28:32.671
I'll be right back.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.091
I just wanted to
let you know

28:36.299 --> 28:38.134
that I've decided
to help your father.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.304
You did? You will?

28:41.513 --> 28:43.139
Well, you've helped
our family.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.724
Cheryl, especially.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.477
You fit in so well.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.229
I think you and your father

28:49.437 --> 28:51.064
have a very bright
future with us.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.190
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.234
Oh. "Clifford", please.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.985
And just so you know,

28:56.194 --> 28:57.737
you don't have
to keep doing me favors.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.280
I like Cheryl.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.574
And I'm happy to be
here for her, as a friend.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.660
You know, I'm going
to be honest with you.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.705
Cheryl's a bright girl,

29:06.913 --> 29:09.374
but the Blossom board,
they're very skeptical

29:09.582 --> 29:12.836
of having her play
an active role
in the company.

29:13.044 --> 29:16.089
Now, someone with your stock
and character by her side,

29:16.297 --> 29:19.718
tempering her more
erratic behavior...

29:21.302 --> 29:22.846
You know, it's about...

29:24.264 --> 29:25.640
Creating a picture.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.016
The right picture.

29:27.225 --> 29:29.185
Having you with us,
with Cheryl,

29:29.394 --> 29:31.104
it tells a very
appealing story.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.355
Which is something I think

29:32.564 --> 29:33.982
we could all use
right about now.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.110
You'll help us, won't you?

29:37.652 --> 29:39.112
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom,

29:39.320 --> 29:40.822
may I have this first dance
with Archie?

29:41.030 --> 29:42.407
I think
that's an excellent idea.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.998
Polly, can we talk about
what's going on here?

29:50.415 --> 29:53.042
Just keep dancing.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.419
And smiling.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.882
Betty keeps asking
Cheryl about me,

29:59.090 --> 30:00.133
she needs to stop.

30:00.341 --> 30:02.552
As long as she's worried
about you, Polly,
she'll never stop.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.095
Yes, she will...

30:04.637 --> 30:06.931
If I tell you
the real reason
I'm at Thornhill.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.143
The Blossoms had something
to do with Jason's death,

30:10.351 --> 30:11.102
I'm sure of it.

30:11.311 --> 30:12.979
They threatened him
and I'm gonna prove it.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.397
Is that why you
keep blowing Betty off?

30:14.606 --> 30:16.065
It has to be believable.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.776
And I don't want her
trying to rescue me.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.487
Can you please
tell her that for me?

30:20.904 --> 30:22.280
I'm so done with this!
Do not make a scene.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.990
No, I'm done.
I'm done!
Not now.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.283
Polly, will you excuse me?

30:39.130 --> 30:40.048
Betty.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.258
Veronica, hey.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.343
Mom, these are my friends.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.136
This is Betty
and this is Veronica.

30:46.179 --> 30:47.806
Mrs. Muggs.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.140
Ethel...

30:50.183 --> 30:51.226
We heard what happened,

30:51.434 --> 30:55.063
and we wanted to leave
these flowers with you.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.898
That's very kind.
Thank you.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.149
Please don't...

30:58.358 --> 31:00.610
Don't thank me.

31:01.277 --> 31:04.364
We're just so glad
Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.199
And we'll see you
at school, Ethel?

31:11.955 --> 31:13.623
You don't need
to do this, Vee.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.209
Ethel?

31:18.169 --> 31:19.295
Mrs. Muggs?

31:21.714 --> 31:23.174
There's something
I need to tell you.

31:29.097 --> 31:31.933
My name is Veronica Lodge.

31:33.643 --> 31:35.728
- My father is...
- Hiram Lodge.

31:36.813 --> 31:37.897
Hmm.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.693
And you're showing
your face here?

31:41.901 --> 31:44.320
Mom, she's my friend.

31:44.529 --> 31:45.697
She's not your friend, honey.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.075
Her father is a criminal.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.452
He's the reason Dad
did this to himself.

31:53.663 --> 31:55.039
Ronnie?

31:55.248 --> 31:56.249
Is that true?

31:58.126 --> 31:59.168
Yes.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.213
And I am so sorry.

32:02.422 --> 32:03.923
I wish I could do something.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.134
"Sorry" isn't good enough.

32:06.801 --> 32:09.095
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.306
Your father is ruining lives.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.350
He deserves to sit
behind bars for the rest
of his miserable life.

32:21.024 --> 32:21.733
Come on.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.570
Come on.

32:37.123 --> 32:37.916
Cheryl.

32:39.584 --> 32:40.585
You okay?

32:41.085 --> 32:42.337
What did my dad
say to you?

32:43.546 --> 32:44.964
That everyone thinks
I'm a train wreck?

32:50.470 --> 32:52.347
Jason was the golden boy,

32:53.139 --> 32:54.098
but me...

32:56.184 --> 32:58.102
People hate me, Archie.

32:59.437 --> 33:01.648
And at school,
that's fine, whatever.

33:02.398 --> 33:03.775
But this is my family.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.860
Forget them, Cheryl.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.321
Forget what they think.

33:09.656 --> 33:10.782
I think you're awesome.

33:13.576 --> 33:14.452
Oh, Archie,

33:15.411 --> 33:18.456
sometimes I think you may
be the only decent person
left in Riverdale.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.833
The only person
who doesn't want
something from me.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.044
Or who doesn't want me
to apologize for who I am...

33:24.712 --> 33:25.880
And what I want.

33:33.680 --> 33:34.806
What are you doing?

33:37.350 --> 33:39.268
My lipstick's maple red,
by the way.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.146
In case you're wondering
why it tastes so sweet.

33:54.117 --> 33:57.954
They seem satisfied,
but Uncle Bedford keeps asking
about the drive-in land.

33:58.162 --> 34:00.164
I am so close
to getting that land back.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.043
Hermione Lodge will crumble.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.379
Who would
have thought she'd
prove so resourceful?

34:06.587 --> 34:08.464
Maybe you should've sent her
to jail instead of Hiram.

34:16.639 --> 34:17.348
Hey.

34:20.727 --> 34:21.894
How was your night?

34:31.696 --> 34:33.364
I just got back
from the hospital

34:34.198 --> 34:35.533
where Ethel's dad is.

34:38.327 --> 34:40.163
Because he tried
to kill himself...

34:41.914 --> 34:43.916
Because of what Daddy did...

34:45.752 --> 34:47.795
And, for all I know,
continues to do.

34:52.467 --> 34:55.344
I am done
lying for Dad.

35:12.445 --> 35:13.404
Archie!

35:15.782 --> 35:17.950
I thought it was Cinderella
that ran away from the ball,

35:18.159 --> 35:19.660
not Prince Charming.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.621
Cheryl, I can't do this
right now. I'm leaving.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.039
Archie Andrews,

35:23.247 --> 35:27.502
if you leave, the radiant sun
that is the Blossom family
stops shining on you.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.629
And everything
we've given you,

35:29.837 --> 35:32.340
including Brandenburg,
disappears.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.550
Are you sure
you want to
give that up?

35:34.759 --> 35:36.636
Are you sure you want to
do that to your dad?

35:37.762 --> 35:39.680
Cheryl, I came here as a favor
to your mom, to help you.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.810
Oh, Archie,
don't start lying now.

35:44.018 --> 35:45.478
You may not
want anything from me,

35:45.686 --> 35:47.355
but you do
from my mom and dad,

35:47.980 --> 35:49.357
that's why you're here.

35:50.775 --> 35:52.068
Which means,

35:52.235 --> 35:54.153
as much as I want
you to be better
than everyone else...

35:54.987 --> 35:56.155
You're not.

35:56.364 --> 35:57.615
You're just like the others.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.283
I'm sorry, Cheryl...

35:59.492 --> 36:00.993
But I can't do this anymore.

36:01.994 --> 36:02.954
Goodbye.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.297
Mom?

36:14.215 --> 36:15.842
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.552
She's safe.

36:18.594 --> 36:19.846
She's okay, Mom.

36:20.054 --> 36:21.430
She didn't choose
the Blossoms over us,

36:21.639 --> 36:23.266
she's actually there
to spy on them.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.825
You know, when I
went after this story...

36:44.579 --> 36:47.874
I thought, in the back
of my mind that,

36:48.082 --> 36:49.625
"What if this is it?

36:50.334 --> 36:51.544
"What if this is
finally the time

36:51.752 --> 36:52.920
"that she doesn't come back?"

36:53.129 --> 36:55.214
She will, Mom.

36:55.423 --> 36:57.967
And right now,
she's our woman
on the inside.

36:58.176 --> 36:59.677
We're going
to write this story.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.555
Come write with us

37:02.763 --> 37:03.556
at <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

37:04.515 --> 37:05.892
The school newspaper?

37:06.100 --> 37:08.102
Yeah, that's what we are.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.063
But I'm pretty sure that
our annual operating budget

37:11.272 --> 37:12.773
is bigger than the <i>Register's.</i>

37:28.331 --> 37:29.582
Val.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.250
Val, hey.

37:33.669 --> 37:34.795
Look, you were right.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.048
About being bought
and taking shortcuts.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.175
After last night, I'm done
with the Blossoms, I am.

37:39.383 --> 37:42.136
Good for you, Archie,
but I'm done with you.

37:43.221 --> 37:45.181
Ever since we started dating
you've ignored me,

37:45.389 --> 37:46.807
you've ditched me.

37:47.016 --> 37:48.684
Val, please.

37:48.893 --> 37:50.269
Let me make it up to you.

37:50.478 --> 37:52.813
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you,
I won't be bought.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.030
<i>Just listen, Fred.</i>

38:01.239 --> 38:02.865
So many families
have been hurt
by the Lodges.

38:03.074 --> 38:05.034
Now, I don't want yours
to be another one.

38:05.243 --> 38:07.245
I've decided to sell
to Clifford...

38:07.453 --> 38:08.621
Before it gets any worse.

38:08.829 --> 38:09.956
No, you're not.

38:10.164 --> 38:11.165
I'm going to stay
with the project.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.626
That's great.

38:14.710 --> 38:15.628
Thank you.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.630
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.299
See, from now on,
everything we do
around here

38:20.508 --> 38:22.134
is going to be legal.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.220
A hundred percent
above board.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.514
Agreed. Of course.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.975
Also, my stake is 20%.

38:29.183 --> 38:30.726
If I'm gonna put myself
on the line,

38:30.935 --> 38:32.270
I need some skin in the game.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.606
That's a really big share.

38:38.109 --> 38:41.529
I'm sick of you people
using me and my family
as pawns.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.323
Sure.

38:45.574 --> 38:46.909
Anything else?

38:47.118 --> 38:48.286
Yes.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.079
You and me...

38:50.288 --> 38:51.664
Whatever was going
on there is over.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.291
Now, we're just
business partners.

38:55.543 --> 38:56.711
That's it.

39:03.467 --> 39:04.552
Right.

39:18.691 --> 39:22.236
Ethel,
I meant what I said.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.615
I'm sorry, Ethel,

39:27.908 --> 39:29.910
for everything my family
did to yours.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.877
It's not your fault
what your dad did.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.546
And you were there for me
when no one else was.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.174
More than once.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.427
Seat's not taken,
if you want it.

39:50.014 --> 39:52.099
<i>It seemed that,
for Veronica,</i>

39:52.308 --> 39:55.186
<i>the sins of the father
would remain simply that.</i>

39:56.979 --> 39:59.940
<i>While Archie Andrews
returned from the brink</i>

40:00.149 --> 40:01.984
<i>with one more bit of news.</i>

40:02.193 --> 40:04.820
At the banquet, I heard
Mr. and Mrs. Blossom talking.

40:05.029 --> 40:06.781
It sounded like
Clifford Blossom
was responsible

40:06.989 --> 40:09.241
for sending
Veronica's dad to jail.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.035
Oh, my God.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.454
If Clifford sent
Hiram Lodge to jail,

40:13.662 --> 40:14.955
tore apart his family,

40:16.040 --> 40:18.501
then maybe Hiram was trying
to do the same thing to him?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.878
Yeah, by going after
what the Blossoms value most,

40:21.087 --> 40:23.672
their family, their legacy.

40:25.049 --> 40:26.133
That's a motive.

40:35.893 --> 40:38.187
<i>Winter had come
early to Riverdale.</i>

40:39.688 --> 40:41.440
<i>Brutal and unforgiving.</i>

40:43.067 --> 40:44.360
Did it work?

40:44.902 --> 40:46.278
Are the vultures appeased?

40:47.071 --> 40:48.114
We're not
out of the woods yet.

40:48.322 --> 40:49.281
<i>But it would be nothing</i>

40:49.490 --> 40:51.033
<i>compared to the storm
that was gathering.</i>

40:53.411 --> 40:55.371
<i>A storm of chaos named...</i>

40:55.579 --> 40:57.498
<i>...Cheryl Blossom.</i>

41:01.669 --> 41:02.711
Yes?

41:02.920 --> 41:03.838
Good night, Cheryl.

41:04.964 --> 41:06.090
Good night, Pollykins.
