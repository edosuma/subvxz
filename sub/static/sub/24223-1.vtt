NEWS ANCHOR: <i>It has
now been several years</i>

00:04.320 --> 00:05.786
<i>since the attack
by the creatures</i>

00:05.788 --> 00:07.720
<i>that rose from
the depths of the ocean</i>

00:07.721 --> 00:10.658
<i>and threatened to destroy
all life on earth.</i>

00:10.660 --> 00:12.658
<i>The death toll
was high that day,</i>

00:12.660 --> 00:15.693
<i>particularly on the East Coast
of the United States.</i>

00:15.696 --> 00:19.031
<i>But, thankfully, a team
of specially trained pilots</i>

00:19.033 --> 00:21.568
<i>commandeered the Armada
Military Robot Series</i>

00:21.570 --> 00:23.336
<i>and went to the battle
with the beasts.</i>

00:23.338 --> 00:26.839
<i>Those brave soldiers and
their massive, high-tech armors</i>

00:26.841 --> 00:29.443
<i>saved the planet
from certain destruction.</i>

00:29.445 --> 00:31.345
<i>Despite the success
of the Armadas,</i>

00:31.347 --> 00:33.046
<i>the destruction is widespread,</i>

00:33.048 --> 00:36.683
<i>and rebuilding the areas
hit the hardest has been slow.</i>

00:36.685 --> 00:39.220
<i>Preventing another such
catastrophe is the topic</i>

00:39.222 --> 00:41.988
<i>of much heated debate
amongst the military,</i>

00:41.990 --> 00:45.791
<i>the State Department, and other
national security forces.</i>

00:45.793 --> 00:48.928
<i>But rest assured, patrols
from the sea, on the land,</i>

00:48.930 --> 00:51.165
<i>and in the air remain
steadfast on preventing</i>

00:51.167 --> 00:53.900
<i>such a horrible event
from occurring again.</i>

00:53.902 --> 00:56.235
<i>Nuclear submarines
even comb the ocean's floor</i>

00:56.237 --> 00:58.906
<i>as a part of the vigilant
line of defense.</i>

00:58.908 --> 01:00.873
<i>It's now been years
of peace and quiet,</i>

01:00.875 --> 01:04.546
<i>and the entire world is
about to breathe again.</i>

01:08.617 --> 01:11.118
This is <i>Neptune's Nest.
Intrepid Gull,</i>

01:11.120 --> 01:13.254
<i>do you copy?</i>

01:13.256 --> 01:14.821
Yeah, I'm not dead yet.

01:14.823 --> 01:16.490
How's Red Sector today?

01:16.492 --> 01:18.591
Sonar isn't showing
anything right now.

01:18.593 --> 01:21.193
- Have you been drinking?
- (chuckles)

01:21.195 --> 01:24.163
I'm retired... sort of.

01:24.165 --> 01:26.166
Have you been running
the multiple ray sonar today?

01:26.168 --> 01:28.035
Yeah, a little bit.

01:28.037 --> 01:30.369
Hey, you're still
on the payroll.

01:30.371 --> 01:33.240
Yeah, I've been running it
every day this week.

01:33.242 --> 01:34.975
Nothing to show.

01:34.977 --> 01:37.811
(alarm sounds)

01:37.813 --> 01:41.718
Hold on a second.
I spoke too soon.

01:54.629 --> 01:57.797
I, uh, I got something here.
You seeing this?

01:57.799 --> 01:59.933
Affirmative,
<i>Intrepid Gull.</i>

01:59.935 --> 02:02.068
<i>You are to take preemptive
measures immediately.</i>

02:02.070 --> 02:03.737
All right, relax.

02:03.739 --> 02:06.042
Probably just
a minor tec drift.

02:10.645 --> 02:12.614
Depth mines are launched.

02:16.384 --> 02:21.858
First contact
in five seconds, four...

02:24.058 --> 02:25.561
three...

02:26.962 --> 02:28.063
two...

02:31.099 --> 02:34.268
one.

02:34.270 --> 02:37.604
(explosions)

02:37.606 --> 02:39.538
Contact one,

02:39.540 --> 02:42.741
<i>contact two,
three and four.</i>

02:42.743 --> 02:44.411
All charges
have made contact.

02:44.413 --> 02:46.311
Now I'm not showing anything.

02:46.313 --> 02:48.815
Copy, <i>Intrepid Gull.</i>

02:48.817 --> 02:50.584
<i>We're deploying submersibles
to investigate.</i>

02:50.586 --> 02:52.151
- (alarm sounds)
- What the hell?

02:52.153 --> 02:53.855
They're back!
It's not possible!

02:58.593 --> 03:00.459
Intrepid Gull,
<i>you're to move two clicks</i>

03:00.461 --> 03:01.862
<i>southwest immediately!</i>

03:01.864 --> 03:05.065
I say again,
regroup with the flotilla!

03:05.067 --> 03:06.169
Copy that.

03:11.706 --> 03:13.909
No.
No, no, no.

03:19.348 --> 03:22.452
Holy shit!
What the hell?

03:26.421 --> 03:28.457
Open fire!

03:32.093 --> 03:34.294
What the hell?
Come on, come on!

03:34.296 --> 03:36.064
(men shouting)

04:07.462 --> 04:10.031
(screaming)

04:12.334 --> 04:14.103
Main guns, fire!

04:28.550 --> 04:30.052
(cell phone rings)

04:31.786 --> 04:34.355
Hey, bro, if you need
help with the kids,

04:34.357 --> 04:36.257
<i>you and Jenny gotta do it
on your own.</i>

04:36.259 --> 04:37.690
- They're back!
- What?

04:37.692 --> 04:39.159
They're back, man!

04:39.161 --> 04:40.661
You sure?

04:40.663 --> 04:42.394
They took down a battleship!

04:42.396 --> 04:44.098
<i>It was heading towards shore.</i>

04:44.100 --> 04:45.933
<i>It's probably there by now.</i>

04:45.935 --> 04:48.500
I swear, man.
We found another one!

04:48.502 --> 04:51.337
<i>Someone should be rolling up
on you in a minute.</i>

04:51.339 --> 04:53.038
It's a guy named Russo.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.608
<i>I told everyone we were gonna
see these things again.</i>

04:54.610 --> 04:57.377
And I said to we need to update
the Armadas from day one!

04:57.379 --> 04:59.115
Well, now's your chance.

05:03.552 --> 05:05.019
Well, here's your boy.

05:05.021 --> 05:07.657
All right.
I'll hit you later.

05:16.598 --> 05:18.298
Got him.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.233
Dr. Roth?

05:20.235 --> 05:22.269
My name is Russo,
head of the Tactical

05:22.271 --> 05:25.238
and Security Division
of Hallstrom's Labs.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.574
We're here to escort you
safely to the facility.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.612
Yeah, I know.

05:31.879 --> 05:33.480
Do you mind if
I go grab a change?

05:33.482 --> 05:35.348
We stopped by your house.
We have your things.

05:35.350 --> 05:37.250
They're in the car.
Let's go.

05:37.252 --> 05:38.786
(sighs)

05:38.788 --> 05:41.691
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
We're burning daylight!

05:58.540 --> 06:00.373
(chattering)

06:00.375 --> 06:04.010
- ...in some small way.
- Whenever you're ready.

06:04.012 --> 06:05.878
Oh!

06:05.880 --> 06:09.014
Excuse you! What do you think
you're looking at?

06:09.016 --> 06:10.949
I was just being polite.

06:10.951 --> 06:13.452
Well, that girl's crushing
on you hard, so careful.

06:13.454 --> 06:15.187
She's right. She didn't
charge you for your drinks.

06:15.189 --> 06:16.322
What?

06:16.324 --> 06:17.856
I'm sure
that's not the case.

06:17.858 --> 06:19.459
She's new.
Maybe she made a mistake.

06:19.461 --> 06:21.631
Right.
I'm sure that's what it was.

06:22.964 --> 06:25.300
- This is on me.
- You're damn right it is.

06:30.338 --> 06:32.938
Have you guys heard anything
about what's going down?

06:32.940 --> 06:35.375
All the higher-ups
were a little tense today.

06:35.377 --> 06:37.644
I think I even saw
Worthington on the premises.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.346
I don't know,
but I heard someone

06:39.348 --> 06:41.848
say they wanna bring in
that Dr. Roth guy

06:41.850 --> 06:43.349
that got fired a while ago.

06:43.351 --> 06:45.284
Dr. Roth? Yeah,
that guy's super messed up.

06:45.286 --> 06:47.387
That's why he got fired
in the first place.

06:47.389 --> 06:51.591
If you ask me, I think they
made a mistake letting him go.

06:51.593 --> 06:53.459
He designed the original OS.

06:53.461 --> 06:55.495
He's the only one
who truly knew the Bots.

06:55.497 --> 06:58.130
All I know is Horowitz
was pissed they were thinking

06:58.132 --> 06:59.867
about bringing
in someone else.

06:59.869 --> 07:01.233
Horowitz?

07:01.235 --> 07:03.670
She's super messed up too.
Should be fun.

07:03.672 --> 07:05.671
Tense times.

07:05.673 --> 07:08.140
Hmmm.

07:08.142 --> 07:11.577
That was a risky move.
You should be more careful.

07:11.579 --> 07:13.081
And who's winning?

07:14.916 --> 07:16.882
Oh!
He's got no skills!

07:16.884 --> 07:19.019
I must have some skills.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.253
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be your squad leader.

07:21.255 --> 07:24.223
Between us, I think
it's good that

07:24.225 --> 07:26.058
they're bringing in
some extra help.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.795
We don't know what's coming,

07:27.797 --> 07:29.295
and if it's anything
like last time,

07:29.297 --> 07:30.930
it's not gonna be
a walk in a park.

07:30.932 --> 07:32.899
They kicked those
things' asses last time.

07:32.901 --> 07:34.233
I say bring it on.

07:34.235 --> 07:36.435
I'm itching
for some action too.

07:36.437 --> 07:38.538
But what do we really know
about these things?

07:38.540 --> 07:41.507
We know they're big giant,
ugly-ass motherfuckers,

07:41.509 --> 07:44.010
and they kill people.
What else is there to know?

07:44.012 --> 07:45.978
There is this guy at training
that said he actually

07:45.980 --> 07:48.615
saw one of these things
with his own eyes.

07:48.617 --> 07:50.115
Said it was spitting fire.

07:50.117 --> 07:51.718
What? Like a dragon?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.353
Wait. Don't believe everything
you hear, Badger.

07:54.355 --> 07:56.690
Either way,
these things are strong.

07:56.692 --> 07:59.493
Probably even stronger than us.

07:59.495 --> 08:01.995
I mean, I can't be the only
one who's worried

08:01.997 --> 08:05.664
about these new Bots,
new OS, new everything.

08:05.666 --> 08:08.433
And the feedback pain?

08:08.435 --> 08:10.402
If the real deal's anything
like what they put us through

08:10.404 --> 08:14.207
in simulation,
then we are screwed.

08:14.209 --> 08:17.010
Oh, babe, afraid of pain?

08:17.012 --> 08:19.545
No. I'm concerned
about performance.

08:19.547 --> 08:22.216
(laughs) Yeah! Hammer
has performance anxiety.

08:22.218 --> 08:23.784
Seriously.

08:23.786 --> 08:26.185
I'm willing to do whatever it
takes to defend this country,

08:26.187 --> 08:28.187
but I can't be the
only one who feels like

08:28.189 --> 08:29.992
we're just not ready.

08:31.392 --> 08:33.159
You scared?

08:33.162 --> 08:36.462
Yes.
You should be, too.

08:36.465 --> 08:38.265
And we never even got
to field test these things.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.433
Guys, we've been
in the sim so much.

08:41.436 --> 08:43.201
If we're not ready now,
we're never gonna be.

08:43.203 --> 08:45.537
You don't die in the sim.

08:45.539 --> 08:47.105
Are you afraid to die?

08:47.107 --> 08:49.275
You can't be
if you wanna survive.

08:49.277 --> 08:52.548
I'm ready to die. Are you?

08:54.082 --> 08:55.581
Since the day I was born.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.650
Ooh-rah!

08:57.652 --> 08:59.355
(laughs)

09:02.423 --> 09:04.623
You know we really shouldn't
be talking about this

09:04.625 --> 09:05.892
in a public place.

09:05.894 --> 09:07.459
She's right.

09:07.461 --> 09:09.195
Most of the time.

09:09.197 --> 09:11.330
Quit it with
that charming shit.

09:11.332 --> 09:12.866
What has that
ever gotten you?

09:12.868 --> 09:14.767
Free drinks.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.302
(chuckles)

09:16.304 --> 09:17.704
You guys think we have
time to hit the beach

09:17.706 --> 09:19.104
before we have to go back in?

09:19.106 --> 09:21.206
Oh, I'm so sick of
playing third wheel

09:21.208 --> 09:22.541
with you two wheelbarrows.

09:22.543 --> 09:24.944
- What does that even mean?
- Figure it out.

09:24.946 --> 09:28.047
- We're awesome.
- (laughs)

09:28.049 --> 09:29.715
(pagers beep)

09:29.717 --> 09:32.352
What was that?

09:32.354 --> 09:35.391
- They're playing our song.
- Let's go.

09:42.129 --> 09:43.762
ROTH: So, catch me up.

09:43.764 --> 09:45.531
The creature made land.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.166
We're not sure
what it's doing.

09:47.168 --> 09:48.935
It settled down
along the shore

09:48.937 --> 09:50.435
and hasn't moved since.

09:50.437 --> 09:54.073
This is gonna be as bad
as it was the first time.

09:54.075 --> 09:56.045
(sighs)
Probably worse.

09:58.913 --> 10:02.382
Giant Killer, this is Russo.
We're on approach.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.449
Giant Killer?

10:03.451 --> 10:05.084
Are you comfortable
back there?

10:05.086 --> 10:07.186
No, not really.

10:07.188 --> 10:08.623
Good.

10:37.418 --> 10:39.487
What the hell
is this place?

11:19.595 --> 11:20.761
Long ride, huh?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.661
VOICE:
<i>Personnel on standby.</i>

11:22.663 --> 11:25.464
The facility is
30 stories beneath ground.

11:25.466 --> 11:27.602
(voice makes indistinct
announcement on P.A.)

11:39.248 --> 11:40.716
(computer beeps)

11:42.750 --> 11:45.050
- Hey, Maggie?
- Yeah?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.054
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

11:47.056 --> 11:50.123
Yeah, and it
doesn't look good.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.061
What the...

11:55.029 --> 11:57.028
Come on, Karen, pick up!

11:57.030 --> 11:59.067
(cell phone buzzes)

12:01.201 --> 12:04.237
Alex, uh... I... I was
just about to call you.

12:04.239 --> 12:07.607
Listen, get Sam
and get out now!

12:07.609 --> 12:09.142
<i>I'll meet you
at a rendezvous.</i>

12:09.144 --> 12:10.743
I'm seeing something
really weird.

12:10.745 --> 12:12.512
They're back.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.280
What do you mean,
they're back?

12:14.282 --> 12:16.815
Karen, where's Sam?

12:16.817 --> 12:18.184
She has my car.

12:18.186 --> 12:19.685
She's gonna
pick me up for lunch.

12:19.687 --> 12:21.655
Okay. I'll meet you
at the rendezvous.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.421
<i>Let me know if you
can't get her.</i>

12:23.423 --> 12:26.191
I gotta go now.
I love you.

12:26.193 --> 12:27.628
Wait...

12:31.832 --> 12:34.800
(cell phone buzzes)

12:34.802 --> 12:36.302
(buzzing)

12:36.304 --> 12:38.338
(horns honking,
distant sirens blaring)

12:38.340 --> 12:41.174
KAREN: <i>Sam, call me
as soon as you get this.</i>

12:41.176 --> 12:42.478
<i>It's am emergency!</i>

12:52.520 --> 12:54.153
Try to keep up, Mr. Roth.

12:54.155 --> 12:56.090
Yes, sir.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.596
Dr. Roth?

13:01.663 --> 13:03.161
Thanks for coming out
so quickly.

13:03.163 --> 13:05.498
- Did I have a choice?
- No.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.834
I'm General Worthington.
The Pentagon sent me.

13:07.836 --> 13:09.535
The Pentagon?

13:09.537 --> 13:12.704
This is more of a private
facility. Where's Chuck?

13:12.706 --> 13:15.342
This falls under
the Department of Defense.

13:15.344 --> 13:17.676
Mr. Rickman
will not be present.

13:17.678 --> 13:19.612
Okay.

13:19.614 --> 13:21.982
Larry Enders tells me
you've been caught up

13:21.984 --> 13:24.684
with everything so far.
Is that correct?

13:24.686 --> 13:26.618
Yeah, sort of.
So what's the deal here?

13:26.620 --> 13:29.689
The new Bots aren't working
like Rickman and Mike

13:29.691 --> 13:31.793
and all the other geniuses
thought they would?

13:33.761 --> 13:35.795
What do you want from me?

13:35.797 --> 13:38.031
You were working
on a neural-interface

13:38.033 --> 13:39.733
with artificial intelligence

13:39.735 --> 13:42.334
without the endurance
and transference of pain

13:42.336 --> 13:45.403
from machine to the pilot...

13:45.405 --> 13:48.307
the problem we had
with the last Armada series.

13:48.309 --> 13:49.642
I gave you guys
the solutions.

13:49.644 --> 13:51.176
You didn't wanna use them.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.414
Look, lives
are at stake here.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.418
Let's cut past that.

13:59.254 --> 14:01.720
Okay. Spinal cord
stimulation generator.

14:01.722 --> 14:05.724
It reroutes the sensation
of pain from the axon nerves

14:05.726 --> 14:10.162
and recycles them through the
generator in an endless loop.

14:10.164 --> 14:14.469
So the pain message never makes
it to the brain, essentially.

14:16.538 --> 14:18.671
It sounds easy.
It's not.

14:18.673 --> 14:20.539
Let me guess.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.810
The DOD's neural transfer link
bullshit method

14:23.812 --> 14:27.214
for mitigating pain
failed to prove successful,

14:27.216 --> 14:30.249
and now you realize
that you need to adapt

14:30.251 --> 14:33.419
my neural-transfer link
to the Bots' AI system?

14:33.421 --> 14:35.224
Is that correct, General?

14:37.392 --> 14:40.560
Yes, sir.
Let me show you something.

14:40.562 --> 14:41.663
(sighs)

14:52.673 --> 14:57.142
These are the new Armada Series
Military Robots.

14:57.144 --> 14:58.911
They're not bad.

14:58.913 --> 15:01.750
We need to try your
neural-link immediately.

15:04.152 --> 15:05.621
Let's do it.

15:14.995 --> 15:17.196
I assume you already have
pilots that are trained

15:17.198 --> 15:18.730
to fly these things, right?

15:18.732 --> 15:21.568
Our pilots have been
trained on simulators.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.401
But those simulators
are operated by

15:23.403 --> 15:25.403
the old AI software
interface.

15:25.405 --> 15:27.839
- So never?
- Red tape.

15:27.841 --> 15:29.876
(sighs)
What else is new?

15:29.878 --> 15:32.811
<i>Dr. Horowitz, the buildings
are crumbling like dirt!</i>

15:32.813 --> 15:34.980
<i>Are you telling me
your Bots are not ready?</i>

15:34.982 --> 15:36.348
No. No, no, no.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.517
Look, I can assure you
that the Armada program

15:38.519 --> 15:40.786
is completely
under control, okay?

15:40.788 --> 15:43.489
I can assure you that Roth
nor anyone else is going to be

15:43.491 --> 15:45.557
a problem,
not even the General.

15:45.559 --> 15:47.593
<i>Look, Horowitz,
with all due respect,</i>

15:47.595 --> 15:50.662
<i>someone with as little
experience as you is...</i>

15:50.664 --> 15:52.431
<i>let's just say it's just
a tad bit disconcerting.</i>

15:52.433 --> 15:55.267
I've been in this field
for many years now.

15:55.269 --> 15:57.036
I've seen men and women die,

15:57.038 --> 16:00.573
and I was here the last time
these goddamn things

16:00.575 --> 16:03.309
killed the people that I love
right in front of me!

16:03.311 --> 16:04.877
Can you say the same
for yourself?

16:04.879 --> 16:06.646
<i>Well, then
it's all on you.</i>

16:06.648 --> 16:08.914
<i>Mission accomplished,
you'll get a medal.</i>

16:08.916 --> 16:10.983
<i>Mission failure,
blood on your hands.</i>

16:10.985 --> 16:12.484
<i>More blood.</i>

16:12.486 --> 16:14.387
VOICE ON P.A.:
<i>Mr. Roth has arrived.</i>

16:14.389 --> 16:16.325
I'll be right there.

16:19.226 --> 16:21.261
Ah, Dr. Horowitz.

16:21.263 --> 16:23.595
Has Naval Command
reached you yet?

16:23.597 --> 16:28.267
No, not yet, Dr. Horowitz.
This is Dr. J.P. Roth.

16:28.269 --> 16:31.938
He'll be assisting us for
the robotics' neural-interface.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.305
Nice to meet you.

16:33.307 --> 16:34.806
I know who you are.

16:34.808 --> 16:37.609
I read your theory on quantum
interconnectivity, yeah.

16:37.611 --> 16:39.645
I thought it was very
well thought out.

16:39.647 --> 16:41.147
You know, theoretically
speaking, of course.

16:41.149 --> 16:43.483
But would it really work
in reality? I don't know.

16:43.485 --> 16:45.017
Should I take that
as a compliment?

16:45.019 --> 16:46.518
Maybe.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.321
Dr. Roth? Andrus is
on a secure line for you.

16:49.323 --> 16:50.658
Thank you.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.258
Hello?

16:53.260 --> 16:55.427
- You at the labs?
- Yeah.

16:55.429 --> 16:56.796
I'm gonna dial in
my interface,

16:56.798 --> 16:58.229
see if I can get these
Bots up and running.

16:58.231 --> 17:00.900
Fantastic!
Keep me posted!

17:00.902 --> 17:04.237
Will do.
Hey, take care of yourself.

17:04.239 --> 17:06.642
You do the same.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.844
All right.

17:11.846 --> 17:15.384
Dr. Roth?
If you will...

17:19.086 --> 17:20.689
There she is.

17:21.856 --> 17:24.423
LILAC.

17:24.425 --> 17:26.961
- Ready to get activated?
- Yes, sir.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.433
(electrical sizzling)

17:34.435 --> 17:36.602
Ooh! Someone changed
the operating system?

17:36.604 --> 17:39.104
Yeah. We're on Robonet.

17:39.106 --> 17:40.672
Are you kidding?

17:40.674 --> 17:43.074
My interface was designed
to work with Python.

17:43.076 --> 17:44.980
What?

17:47.248 --> 17:48.814
(explosion)

17:48.816 --> 17:51.883
What the...?
What was that?

17:51.885 --> 17:54.889
I don't know,
but it wasn't good.

17:58.259 --> 17:59.994
(helicopters approaching)

18:13.240 --> 18:15.876
(cell phone rings)

18:18.480 --> 18:20.813
Mom, I'm stuck in traffic.

18:20.815 --> 18:22.981
Sam, I-I need you
to pick me up now!

18:22.983 --> 18:25.817
Well, tell that to
the idiot causing the traffic.

18:25.819 --> 18:28.653
Okay, well, you need to
find a different route.

18:28.655 --> 18:30.655
Wh-what's wrong?

18:30.657 --> 18:32.792
You have five minutes!

18:32.794 --> 18:35.831
Five minutes? Mom, I'm gonna
have to break a few laws.

18:37.198 --> 18:40.065
Five minutes. Don't stop
for anyone or anything.

18:40.067 --> 18:44.335
Awesome. Wait.
This isn't some kind of trick?

18:44.337 --> 18:46.540
I love you. Be safe.

18:52.646 --> 18:54.780
Python integrates better
with brain mapping.

18:54.782 --> 18:56.681
I mean, it costs more,
a hell of lot more,

18:56.683 --> 19:00.186
but it's better
for the crossover.

19:00.188 --> 19:01.853
Robonet's like a dinosaur.

19:01.855 --> 19:04.590
Money's not an issue.
This is life or death.

19:04.592 --> 19:07.226
Robonet and Python RTC
do share some

19:07.228 --> 19:11.530
common binary interface,
but... one wrong line of code,

19:11.532 --> 19:12.965
this whole place
is gonna blow.

19:12.967 --> 19:15.470
Have the pilots
been brain-mapped?

19:16.471 --> 19:18.837
- They have.
- Great.

19:18.839 --> 19:19.905
(sighs)

19:19.907 --> 19:21.474
Look, I can only write
so much code.

19:21.476 --> 19:23.111
Let me see those pilots.

19:38.358 --> 19:40.492
RUSSO: <i>All pilots
report to the side room.</i>

19:40.494 --> 19:43.063
<i>I repeat, report to the side
room as soon as possible.</i>

19:59.914 --> 20:01.646
Bunch of kids.

20:01.648 --> 20:03.516
I hope I don't fry
their brains.

20:03.518 --> 20:05.720
GENERAL WORTHINGTON:
They've had training, Doc.

20:09.423 --> 20:12.760
What's going on, Doc?
Why aren't the Bots responding?

20:16.263 --> 20:17.965
That lag.

20:20.868 --> 20:23.902
I can't fix the lag without
overhauling the entire software.

20:23.904 --> 20:25.904
There's no time
for that, Doctor!

20:25.906 --> 20:27.640
These pilots
are highly trained.

20:27.642 --> 20:29.508
They'll be able to compensate.

20:29.510 --> 20:32.178
I'm not sending these
pilots up there

20:32.180 --> 20:34.080
to their death without
control of their Bots!

20:34.082 --> 20:35.814
Do you get it?

20:35.816 --> 20:38.718
My name is Hammer, sir.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.821
I knew the risks when
I signed up for the job.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.855
They need us out there.

20:43.857 --> 20:48.061
Do you understand the problem
we have here, Hammer?

20:48.063 --> 20:50.196
You have a lag.

20:50.198 --> 20:53.332
That's a delayed response
in your brain's motor impulse

20:53.334 --> 20:55.767
to the Bot's AI system.

20:55.769 --> 20:59.103
You'll never see a strike.
You see?

20:59.105 --> 21:03.575
If you had a lag, you never
would have seen that coming.

21:03.577 --> 21:06.577
I appreciate
your concern, sir.

21:06.579 --> 21:08.213
We all do.

21:08.215 --> 21:11.182
It's all we got, Doc.

21:11.184 --> 21:14.923
I lost my family
to those things three years ago.

21:15.824 --> 21:20.595
Please, let us do our jobs.

21:23.565 --> 21:26.301
All right, rig 'em up.

21:37.913 --> 21:38.878
Mom?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.645
Out! I'm driving.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.750
What? What's going on?

21:49.990 --> 21:51.257
We have to get out of town.

21:51.259 --> 21:54.559
What about work?
Where's Dad?

21:54.561 --> 21:56.862
He's gonna meet us
at grandma's house.

21:56.864 --> 21:59.765
In Tennessee?
Out there?

21:59.767 --> 22:01.803
This must be bad.

22:07.407 --> 22:08.873
Okay, who's ready?

22:08.875 --> 22:11.376
- Ready, sir.
- Have a seat.

22:11.378 --> 22:13.879
Mr. Hammer, you're gonna
feel a small shock.

22:13.881 --> 22:15.748
It will subside
after a moment.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.216
Initializing.

22:17.218 --> 22:18.383
Activating.

22:18.385 --> 22:19.684
(electrical sizzling)

22:19.686 --> 22:21.187
Yes, sir. Felt that.

22:21.189 --> 22:23.892
His head's all ready.
Next victim, please.

22:25.058 --> 22:28.059
- Call sign "Bugs," sir.
- Bugs?

22:28.061 --> 22:31.832
- Sting like a bee...
- That's original. Sit down.

22:34.567 --> 22:36.904
- Initializing.
- I got it.

22:38.873 --> 22:40.206
Activating.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.676
(electrical sizzling)

22:42.710 --> 22:44.442
Stung you?

22:44.444 --> 22:45.611
I can handle it.

22:45.613 --> 22:47.782
Okay. Next victim.

22:49.884 --> 22:52.617
Call sign "Badger," sir.

22:52.619 --> 22:54.388
Have a seat.

22:58.759 --> 23:01.526
- Initializing.
- Activating.

23:01.528 --> 23:04.263
(electrical sizzling)

23:04.265 --> 23:07.900
- Feels good.
- Feels good. Okay.

23:07.902 --> 23:09.768
We're all set.

23:09.770 --> 23:13.171
So, we're
ready to test them out?

23:13.173 --> 23:14.472
Yes, sir.

23:14.474 --> 23:16.575
You heard the man.
Climb into your Armada.

23:16.577 --> 23:18.044
Yes, sir!

23:18.046 --> 23:19.411
All right, let's lock
and load! Let's go!

23:19.413 --> 23:20.946
You heard the man!

23:20.948 --> 23:22.717
Let's go, let's go!
We ain't got time!

23:49.343 --> 23:52.545
Their exoskeletons
have calcified exponentially,

23:52.547 --> 23:55.881
presumably due to the increased
temperature in the core.

23:55.883 --> 23:57.615
Blaming it
on global warming?

23:57.617 --> 24:00.753
Bone density isn't singular
like a normal organism.

24:00.755 --> 24:02.854
It's layered.

24:02.856 --> 24:04.890
Compared to the last ones,

24:04.892 --> 24:07.793
these ones are making them
look like crickets.

24:07.795 --> 24:11.229
This hedomorph is truly
an incredible creature.

24:11.231 --> 24:13.465
(chuckles)
What is it with you?

24:13.467 --> 24:14.967
What?

24:14.969 --> 24:17.202
I don't know.
You seem to admire these things.

24:17.204 --> 24:20.738
I'm studying the physical form
of an unknown alien species.

24:20.740 --> 24:23.275
These hedomorphs have killed
millions of people, okay?

24:23.277 --> 24:25.043
Forgive me if
I'm not fascinated.

24:25.045 --> 24:26.978
Yeah, and you need
to understand your enemy

24:26.980 --> 24:28.450
in order to defeat them.

24:38.526 --> 24:40.028
I know enough.

24:41.862 --> 24:43.629
Why are you even here?

24:43.631 --> 24:46.097
I was looking
for an LDO to add

24:46.099 --> 24:47.533
to the Bots' matrix interface,

24:47.535 --> 24:49.468
but apparently they have
changed everything.

24:49.470 --> 24:51.903
Why an LDO?
What would that do?

24:51.905 --> 24:55.475
It'll help with the respond
to the RR and with compliance.

24:55.477 --> 24:59.112
Not by much, but at this point,
I'll take what we can get.

24:59.114 --> 24:59.911
Mm.

24:59.913 --> 25:01.814
Now General Worthington,

25:01.816 --> 25:06.084
he seems pretty willing
to sacrifice his pilots.

25:06.086 --> 25:07.419
You know him better than I do.

25:07.421 --> 25:09.087
Can we trust him
not to push them too far?

25:09.089 --> 25:11.055
No, he knows what
they're capable of.

25:11.057 --> 25:12.757
I wouldn't underestimate them.

25:12.759 --> 25:14.227
They're tougher
than you think.

25:14.229 --> 25:15.594
This is not about being tough.

25:15.596 --> 25:18.229
When you link
into the Bots' matrix,

25:18.231 --> 25:20.132
it's a whole other level
of strength that's required.

25:20.134 --> 25:22.534
And I know these Armadas
better than anyone else.

25:22.536 --> 25:24.569
You did.

25:24.571 --> 25:26.505
Been out of the game
for a while now, Roth.

25:26.507 --> 25:29.074
I noticed. I spent years

25:29.076 --> 25:31.709
coding and programming
these things to a T.

25:31.711 --> 25:33.778
I come back, and there's
Mickey Mouse code on it.

25:33.780 --> 25:37.984
Listen, I know it doesn't
look like it used to.

25:37.986 --> 25:40.052
But we've made
considerable progress.

25:40.054 --> 25:42.287
The Armadas are the best
they're gonna be.

25:42.289 --> 25:43.956
Obviously not.

25:43.958 --> 25:47.394
Otherwise they wouldn't
have brought me back.

26:48.821 --> 26:50.424
I'm linked in.

26:54.461 --> 26:57.228
Okay, Hammer, when you move,
don't just physically move.

26:57.230 --> 27:00.099
I want you to consciously
concentrate on the movement.

27:00.101 --> 27:01.767
The neural-interface
will work faster

27:01.769 --> 27:03.536
with your brain motor impulse.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.836
Make sense?

27:04.838 --> 27:07.008
I think so.

27:14.448 --> 27:15.917
Okay.

27:17.451 --> 27:20.255
Now you need to get a grasp
on the delay time, okay?

27:24.825 --> 27:26.624
Bugs and Badger,
you do the same.

27:26.626 --> 27:28.860
Come up with a movement
for your Bot.

27:28.862 --> 27:32.033
- Copy.
- Copy.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.104
Keep working with it.

27:40.106 --> 27:42.475
You guys have to compensate
for the lag time.

27:42.477 --> 27:44.412
It's the only thing that's
gonna save your life out there.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.980
Okay, let's check on
your weapons systems now.

27:49.982 --> 27:52.486
All right!
Party time.

27:57.357 --> 27:59.290
There's no delay
in the weapons system.

27:59.292 --> 28:01.893
We have that going for us.
Pilots!

28:01.895 --> 28:04.529
<i>Begin prep
and final diagnostics!</i>

28:04.531 --> 28:06.532
<i>The creature is holding
its position,</i>

28:06.534 --> 28:08.199
<i>and we are still unsure
of its intentions,</i>

28:08.201 --> 28:10.235
<i>but it's causing
mass destruction</i>

28:10.237 --> 28:12.904
<i>and we need to get you
into the field.</i>

28:12.906 --> 28:15.306
Begin initial on sequence.

28:15.308 --> 28:16.677
- BUGS: <i>Roger.</i>
- Copy.

28:23.150 --> 28:25.182
Retract orbital arms.

28:25.184 --> 28:27.652
<i>Main engines start.</i>

28:27.654 --> 28:29.188
Copy that.

28:29.190 --> 28:31.993
Ready to launch.
I say again, ready to launch.

28:33.126 --> 28:35.059
We're clear to lift off.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.761
All right!

28:36.763 --> 28:38.565
Engage boosters.

28:58.419 --> 29:01.355
Mom, I'm scared!

29:04.223 --> 29:06.324
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

29:06.326 --> 29:08.496
We just need to
get out of town.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.369
(monster roars)

29:17.037 --> 29:19.103
SAM:
Mom, watch out!

29:19.105 --> 29:21.507
Mom, we're gonna die here.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.775
Sam, we have to stay calm.

29:23.777 --> 29:26.210
Everyone's getting out
of their car!

29:26.212 --> 29:28.980
To where?
We have to stay here.

29:28.982 --> 29:32.250
And get crushed like a bug?
No! We're leaving!

29:32.252 --> 29:35.490
Sam... Damn it.

29:39.526 --> 29:40.628
Sam!

29:43.931 --> 29:46.131
We're still a couple
of miles out from the contact.

29:46.133 --> 29:47.932
How's everybody doing?

29:47.934 --> 29:51.269
BUGS: <i>Helm is a little slow
to respond, but I can deal.</i>

29:51.271 --> 29:54.405
BADGER: <i>This Bot
is barely responsive.</i>

29:54.407 --> 29:55.740
Yeah.

29:55.742 --> 29:58.043
Let's get a little practice
in along the way,

29:58.045 --> 30:01.082
work out all the kinks now
before we engage this thing.

30:13.227 --> 30:14.829
(grunts)

30:25.538 --> 30:27.674
You guys getting
the hang of the lag time?

30:29.676 --> 30:31.411
HAMMER:
<i>Affirmative, sir.</i>

30:32.846 --> 30:35.346
<i>It's taking
some getting used to,</i>

30:35.348 --> 30:38.249
<i>but we'll be okay.</i>

30:39.854 --> 30:42.053
Bugs? Badger?

30:42.055 --> 30:44.826
- BUGS: <i>Yeah, I'm good, sir.</i>
- BADGER: <i>Same.</i>

30:56.435 --> 31:00.271
Giant Killer,
we have visual on the bogey.

31:00.273 --> 31:02.641
I say again, we have
visual on the bogey.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.579
And it's a lot bigger
than I thought.

31:09.817 --> 31:12.586
General, this lag time
is gonna kill 'em.

31:14.755 --> 31:17.456
You really want them operating
without full control?

31:17.458 --> 31:19.357
They'll be fine, Dr. Roth.

31:19.359 --> 31:20.825
Giant Killer?

31:20.827 --> 31:23.193
<i>Awaiting instructions,
Giant Killer.</i>

31:23.195 --> 31:25.096
You are clear
to engage, Hammer!

31:25.098 --> 31:27.699
I say again,
you are clear to engage!

31:27.701 --> 31:32.069
You heard the man.
We're clear to engage.

31:32.071 --> 31:33.372
Roger.

31:33.374 --> 31:35.440
Solid copy.

31:35.442 --> 31:39.612
Badger, Bugs, cover me.
I'm sending in rockets.

31:39.614 --> 31:40.914
Copy that.

31:51.992 --> 31:53.560
Bam!

31:58.699 --> 32:00.768
<panting>

32:03.303 --> 32:07.072
Giant Killer?
Direct hit on bogey.

32:07.074 --> 32:09.274
I say again, direct hit!

32:09.276 --> 32:12.276
Good job, Hammer!

32:12.278 --> 32:14.946
Can you confirm
the creature is deceased?

32:14.948 --> 32:18.286
We'll move in for
a closer look, Giant Killer.

32:29.997 --> 32:33.430
- <i>Did you guys see that?</i>
- HAMMER: Yeah.

32:33.432 --> 32:35.603
BADGER:
<i>What does that mean?</i>

32:44.845 --> 32:45.944
(growls)

32:45.946 --> 32:47.711
It's not dead, guys!

32:47.713 --> 32:50.548
BADGER: <i>Giant killer!
The bogey is not deceased!</i>

32:50.550 --> 32:52.886
<i>I say again,
it is not deceased.</i>

32:56.189 --> 32:59.627
(grunts)

33:02.262 --> 33:04.497
This thing is getting
slower and slower!

33:11.438 --> 33:12.673
(grunts)

33:14.842 --> 33:16.641
(electrical sizzling)

33:16.643 --> 33:19.678
I've... I've got a problem.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.645
(machinery powers down)

33:21.647 --> 33:24.382
My control panel
is shorting out.

33:24.384 --> 33:26.420
I think I'm losing power.

33:31.125 --> 33:32.826
Is that Dad?

33:37.064 --> 33:38.798
What just happened?

33:42.303 --> 33:44.001
Giant Killer?

33:44.003 --> 33:45.270
- Sam...
- Is it over?

33:45.272 --> 33:47.440
Sam, we need to go!
We need to go!

33:51.746 --> 33:55.080
(coughing)

33:55.082 --> 33:57.582
Guys! Guys! Guys!

33:57.584 --> 33:59.817
I need... I need help!

33:59.819 --> 34:02.321
I need...
I need your help!

34:02.323 --> 34:04.757
I'm having a hard time
breathing.

34:04.759 --> 34:06.557
(coughing)

34:06.559 --> 34:09.460
We've lost radio contact
with Armada One!

34:09.463 --> 34:11.661
It's shutting down,
going off-line!

34:11.664 --> 34:13.297
Life support is failing!

34:13.300 --> 34:14.797
I can't do anything
from here.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.934
I have to get out there.
It's not a system error!

34:16.936 --> 34:19.670
It's a physical problem
aboard the Bot!

34:19.672 --> 34:22.074
Hammer, what's going
on in there?

34:22.076 --> 34:24.344
Hang on, Hammer!

34:26.512 --> 34:27.981
I'm coming, Hammer!

34:30.349 --> 34:32.016
BADGER: Bugs, watch out!

34:32.018 --> 34:35.054
Yeah, yeah, I know.

34:35.056 --> 34:36.755
Bugs, stay on this thing!

34:36.757 --> 34:38.989
I'm gonna go and cover Hammer!

34:38.992 --> 34:42.429
General, I have to get
out there, please! Right now!

34:44.130 --> 34:45.465
Russo.

34:46.934 --> 34:48.967
Lee, Wright. Let's go!
Let's boogie!

34:48.969 --> 34:52.469
Dr. Horowitz, I need one
of you to stay here.

34:52.472 --> 34:54.108
- Hey!
- Doctor!

34:55.543 --> 34:57.242
Sorry, Doctor.
We can't let you do that.

34:57.244 --> 34:58.744
It's too dangerous.

34:58.746 --> 35:01.112
I did a four-year residency
in a trauma ward.

35:01.114 --> 35:03.447
We do not have time
for this shit.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.284
- We need to go.
- Hammer needs me there.

35:06.286 --> 35:08.287
I'll shadow her, Russo.

35:08.289 --> 35:09.686
But stay close.

35:09.688 --> 35:12.359
Let's go!
Let's go!

35:15.094 --> 35:16.693
BADGER: <i>You okay
in there, Bugs?</i>

35:16.695 --> 35:18.465
Yeah, I'm good.

35:23.070 --> 35:24.672
Holy cow.

35:26.974 --> 35:28.340
That's all right,
we'll be fine.

35:28.342 --> 35:30.010
Almost there.

35:32.978 --> 35:34.079
(grunts)

35:34.081 --> 35:35.950
Son of a...

35:41.188 --> 35:42.490
Shit!

35:44.356 --> 35:46.557
Stay calm, Doctor,
stay calm.

35:46.559 --> 35:48.392
Oh, my God.

35:48.394 --> 35:51.398
(monster groans)

35:53.199 --> 35:55.333
I didn't know
they made them that big.

35:55.335 --> 35:56.469
It's crazy.

35:57.637 --> 35:59.172
Hit the gas!

36:01.041 --> 36:04.275
We're all right.
Almost there. Easy.

36:04.277 --> 36:06.447
How's our six doing, Wright?

36:19.492 --> 36:21.659
Wright, you're on six.

36:21.661 --> 36:23.094
Look, look! Hold on, hold on.
You can see air.

36:23.096 --> 36:24.496
What?

36:24.498 --> 36:26.197
Air coming
out of his cockpit.

36:26.199 --> 36:28.266
That's the oxygen supply.

36:28.268 --> 36:29.568
How do we fix it?

36:29.570 --> 36:31.168
These robots,
they're equipped with

36:31.170 --> 36:33.704
tank units,
just like spacecraft.

36:33.706 --> 36:36.206
The impact from the attack
probably knocked out

36:36.208 --> 36:37.876
the filtration, right?

36:37.878 --> 36:39.911
So we have to seal the valve.

36:39.913 --> 36:41.880
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna try to salvage

36:41.882 --> 36:46.117
the ECU to get
the Armada back online.

36:46.119 --> 36:49.121
Okay, you do that.
I'm gonna take care of Hammer.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.822
(monster roars)

36:51.824 --> 36:55.827
Damn it, Bugs!
Shoot the damn thing!

36:55.829 --> 36:57.496
You're too close
for the missile.

36:57.498 --> 36:59.530
I'm gonna have
to use the Gatling.

36:59.532 --> 37:01.733
That's fine.
Just do something!

37:01.735 --> 37:04.003
Engaging the Gatling guns.

37:05.271 --> 37:08.007
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

37:09.608 --> 37:11.510
- Yes, sir.
- Lee?

37:11.512 --> 37:13.545
- I'm on it, Russo.
- Hold it down.

37:13.547 --> 37:15.949
I'm going up.

37:22.188 --> 37:25.289
Hammer!
Hammer!

37:25.291 --> 37:26.759
No response.

37:30.197 --> 37:32.197
(coughing)

37:32.199 --> 37:34.566
The cockpit
is filled with gas.

37:34.568 --> 37:36.568
We have to get Hammer
out of there.

37:36.570 --> 37:38.572
HOROWITZ:
Roth, you too.

37:44.378 --> 37:47.181
(coughing)

37:50.182 --> 37:51.284
Hammer.

37:52.985 --> 37:55.619
- Hammer!
- Oh, my God.

37:55.621 --> 37:58.990
(coughing)

37:58.992 --> 38:00.291
Hammer!

38:00.293 --> 38:02.760
- I got it, go fix the ECU.
- I'm on it!

38:02.762 --> 38:04.396
- Stay with me, please.
- Hang in there, baby.

38:04.398 --> 38:06.130
- Look at me.
- Come on!

38:06.132 --> 38:07.831
Hammer!

38:07.833 --> 38:10.670
I don't have a pulse.
Get my medical bag!

38:12.405 --> 38:13.604
Hang on, buddy.

38:13.606 --> 38:15.505
Hang on. Don't you give up.

38:15.507 --> 38:17.075
- We got you!
- Come on, man!

38:17.077 --> 38:20.045
RUSSO: Roth! It's getting
real hard to breathe!

38:20.047 --> 38:21.880
Stay with us!

38:21.882 --> 38:23.615
- Come on!
- Don't you give up now.

38:23.617 --> 38:26.150
Stay with me.

38:26.152 --> 38:27.952
Come on!

38:27.954 --> 38:30.121
Come on.

38:30.123 --> 38:32.025
Hammer, come on.

38:34.827 --> 38:37.295
- We took too long.
- God damn it!

38:37.297 --> 38:40.398
He's dead.
He's dead. We gotta go.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.800
We'll take him with us.
We can't just leave him.

38:42.802 --> 38:44.903
We don't got time!
We gotta go,

38:44.905 --> 38:46.637
or we're all gonna suffocate.

38:46.639 --> 38:48.275
Go, go!

38:57.550 --> 38:59.018
I'll stay and clean up.

39:09.228 --> 39:11.095
The entire human species
working together

39:11.097 --> 39:13.099
couldn't take this thing out.

39:15.168 --> 39:18.369
Damn it, Bugs!
What in the hell are you doing?

39:18.371 --> 39:20.472
<i>Badger, use your missiles!</i>

39:20.474 --> 39:22.574
Negative!
It's too risky!

39:22.576 --> 39:23.773
Release it!

39:23.775 --> 39:25.443
<i>You have a clear shot!</i>

39:25.445 --> 39:26.610
<i>Blow this son of a bitch away!</i>

39:26.612 --> 39:28.348
<i>I can't hold onto him forever!</i>

39:31.585 --> 39:33.485
Missiles away!

39:33.487 --> 39:34.818
<i>Disengage!</i>

39:34.820 --> 39:36.554
Take cover! Take cover!
Take cover!

39:36.556 --> 39:39.025
(monster shrieks)

39:54.407 --> 39:56.173
The creature is down!

39:56.175 --> 39:59.443
I say again,
the creature is down!

39:59.445 --> 40:01.248
Giant Killer, copy!

40:03.916 --> 40:06.450
We have visual confirmation.

40:06.452 --> 40:08.019
Good work, Mr. Russo.

40:08.021 --> 40:09.686
<i>What's the status on Hammer?</i>

40:09.688 --> 40:12.690
Mr. Russo,
where is Hammer?

40:12.692 --> 40:15.262
I say again, where
is Hammer?

40:21.634 --> 40:23.334
Where's Hammer?

40:23.336 --> 40:24.838
He's dead.

40:26.472 --> 40:28.139
What?

40:28.141 --> 40:30.043
No!

40:34.380 --> 40:36.347
No!

40:36.349 --> 40:38.085
Damn!

40:39.985 --> 40:42.586
All right, I gotta
get a closer look.

40:42.588 --> 40:44.121
No, no, no.

40:44.123 --> 40:46.124
Look! Look, I have
to get closer, okay?

40:46.126 --> 40:48.124
If there are more things
out there like this,

40:48.126 --> 40:50.230
I have to learn
everything I can!

41:02.742 --> 41:04.445
You are killing me.

41:07.179 --> 41:09.579
Bugs and Badger,
Bugs and Badger, this is Russo.

41:09.581 --> 41:13.784
ASAP, ASAP,
I need overview.

41:13.786 --> 41:15.787
Copy, Giant Killer!

41:15.789 --> 41:17.758
Copy.

41:21.393 --> 41:22.428
Let's go.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.768
(groaning)

41:32.172 --> 41:35.474
This doesn't...
This doesn't look good.

41:35.476 --> 41:37.575
- Run!
- This doesn't look good.

41:37.577 --> 41:39.077
- Go, go, go!
- Fall back!

41:39.079 --> 41:40.644
- Take cover, go!
- Go, go, go!

41:40.646 --> 41:43.313
Fall back! Cover, cover,
cover! Fall in! Fall in!

41:43.315 --> 41:46.419
RUSSO: Armada, Armada,
multiple hostile movers!

42:01.867 --> 42:03.402
(grunts)

42:10.409 --> 42:12.078
No! No!

42:13.512 --> 42:15.646
No! No!

42:15.648 --> 42:17.116
(sharp cry)

42:18.818 --> 42:20.452
Ah!

42:20.454 --> 42:22.856
(gunshots)

42:32.297 --> 42:35.032
WORTHINGTON:
<i>Bugs, Badger, hold fire!</i>

42:35.034 --> 42:36.633
<i>Abort, abort!</i>

42:36.635 --> 42:38.204
Copy, Giant Killer.

42:41.875 --> 42:44.041
Bugs, where are you?

42:44.043 --> 42:45.945
I'm here!

42:48.914 --> 42:51.014
All right.

42:51.016 --> 42:52.351
Returning to base!

42:53.519 --> 42:56.355
(monsters chittering)

42:58.992 --> 43:01.028
(cell phone rings)

43:03.563 --> 43:05.863
Oh, God! Okay.

43:05.865 --> 43:07.065
Alex? Alex?

43:07.067 --> 43:08.700
- Karen?
- Are you okay?

43:08.702 --> 43:09.800
<i>Look, I'm fine.</i>

43:09.802 --> 43:11.369
Karen, are you
out of the city?

43:11.371 --> 43:12.470
<i>No.</i>

43:12.472 --> 43:14.537
We're looking
for a pheno-bunker.

43:14.539 --> 43:15.907
<i>Are you still driving?</i>

43:15.909 --> 43:18.476
(panting)
No, we had to go on foot.

43:18.478 --> 43:20.878
<i>Karen, no!
You cannot be on foot!</i>

43:20.880 --> 43:23.180
I mean, we're okay
for the moment.

43:23.182 --> 43:26.016
It got really quiet.
Did you guys kill it?

43:26.018 --> 43:27.517
<i>You need to get off
the streets!</i>

43:27.519 --> 43:29.054
Mom...

43:29.056 --> 43:30.387
<i>Find a room, lock
yourselves in there now!</i>

43:30.389 --> 43:32.090
- <i>I'll come for you.</i>
- Okay...

43:32.092 --> 43:33.458
- Mom!
- What?

43:33.460 --> 43:34.994
(monsters chittering)

43:35.961 --> 43:37.827
Shit, shit!

43:37.829 --> 43:39.496
Karen!

43:39.498 --> 43:40.600
Damn it!

43:44.538 --> 43:47.003
We'll reorganize,

43:47.005 --> 43:49.373
mobilize ground troops.

43:49.375 --> 43:53.077
We'll send the Armadas back
out as overwatch.

43:53.079 --> 43:55.880
The ground troops can
go building to building,

43:55.882 --> 43:59.516
street to street
to clear the insects.

43:59.518 --> 44:03.354
We can't let them
get too far inland.

44:03.356 --> 44:06.092
We'll never be able
to contain them.

44:07.193 --> 44:09.461
Negative.
Absolutely not.

44:09.463 --> 44:11.795
No, that means way too many
casualties, General.

44:11.797 --> 44:13.863
Civilians are bound to get
caught up in the crossfire.

44:13.865 --> 44:15.668
It's too risky.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.673
We're moving to Phase Two.

44:23.675 --> 44:25.275
Copy.

44:25.277 --> 44:27.580
We'll implement Phase Two.

44:29.349 --> 44:32.019
Anyone care to tell me
what Phase Two is?

44:38.190 --> 44:40.657
It's me, Dr. Roth.

44:40.659 --> 44:42.927
Bioweapons.

44:42.929 --> 44:45.595
You gotta be kidding me.

44:45.597 --> 44:46.865
Biological warfare?

44:46.867 --> 44:48.599
You can't come up
with another alternative?

44:48.601 --> 44:50.333
Like send in
an air strike or something?

44:50.335 --> 44:51.869
We did that.
It didn't work.

44:51.871 --> 44:53.403
Well, whatever the hell
you're gonna use,

44:53.405 --> 44:54.673
it's gonna go everywhere.

44:54.675 --> 44:56.474
You're talking about
a major fallout.

44:56.476 --> 44:59.376
Dr. Roth, I'm not gonna
drop a carpet bomb, okay?

44:59.378 --> 45:01.447
I'm gonna target
the creatures specifically.

45:15.161 --> 45:17.664
The Armadas are back.

45:33.679 --> 45:36.880
What is it that
you require, Dr. Horowitz,

45:36.882 --> 45:39.450
to begin Phase Two?

45:39.452 --> 45:41.786
I'm gonna need
one of the spiders.

45:41.788 --> 45:44.157
I need to know what
we're dealing with.

45:47.059 --> 45:48.693
I don't care
what the U.N. thinks.

45:48.695 --> 45:50.163
Pull it up.

45:57.269 --> 46:01.007
I'm sorry, sir.
We did what we could.

46:02.541 --> 46:06.110
Yeah.
I mean... you did.

46:06.112 --> 46:09.179
You did what you could.

46:09.181 --> 46:11.215
(sighs)

46:11.217 --> 46:14.619
We're gonna move forward
with Phase Two now.

46:14.621 --> 46:17.255
Get some rest until
you're needed again.

46:17.257 --> 46:19.257
Badger, keep an eye on her,
will you?

46:19.259 --> 46:20.590
Will do, sir.

46:20.592 --> 46:22.596
Get yourself checked
out by a medic.

46:25.831 --> 46:28.134
(sighs)

46:29.702 --> 46:33.371
I need a perimeter set
around the outskirts of town.

46:33.373 --> 46:38.376
I want anything with more
than two legs killed on sight!

46:38.378 --> 46:40.180
Copy.

46:44.817 --> 46:46.820
(sighs)

46:55.762 --> 46:57.530
Prepared to do anything?

46:58.931 --> 47:00.264
We both are.

47:00.266 --> 47:01.699
We need you.

47:01.701 --> 47:03.566
You understand the robots
better than anyone else,

47:03.568 --> 47:05.403
and that's exactly
why you're here.

47:05.405 --> 47:07.905
But you need to learn
how to follow the rules,

47:07.907 --> 47:09.639
and I make the rules.

47:09.641 --> 47:11.474
How is it that you make
the rules about

47:11.476 --> 47:13.010
what the Armadas
can and cannot do

47:13.012 --> 47:15.612
when you yourself admit that
I know more about them?

47:15.614 --> 47:17.882
Yes, but you're skeptical.

47:17.884 --> 47:19.483
You're full of doubt.

47:19.485 --> 47:22.820
And I know that those robots
are more capable than you think.

47:22.822 --> 47:24.088
They could have been
if Hallstrom

47:24.090 --> 47:25.690
had let me finish my work.

47:25.692 --> 47:30.327
Hey, I completely agree
with you, okay?

47:30.329 --> 47:32.896
And on a separate note,
I admit, you know,

47:32.898 --> 47:35.566
you're not who
I expected you to be either.

47:35.568 --> 47:38.601
Did you say something
nice to me?

47:38.603 --> 47:42.574
I'm just saying I'm sorry
that I misjudged you

47:42.576 --> 47:44.242
- when I first met you.
- You misjudged me?

47:44.244 --> 47:46.709
With all due respect, you
do carry a certain reputation.

47:46.711 --> 47:47.744
I do?

47:47.746 --> 47:50.382
You threw
a chair out the window.

47:51.784 --> 47:52.719
Yeah.

47:54.153 --> 47:58.755
I need to know, if I can
synthesize a targeted bioweapon,

47:58.757 --> 48:00.691
would you be able to
reformat the Armadas

48:00.693 --> 48:02.827
and disperse
everything effectively?

48:02.829 --> 48:06.697
I would have to expend
the resonance

48:06.699 --> 48:09.635
to amplify the power output.
But, yes, it's doable.

48:10.836 --> 48:11.838
Good.

48:34.126 --> 48:36.559
Lee, ridge.

48:36.561 --> 48:38.197
On it.

48:39.431 --> 48:40.798
What are we doing here?

48:40.800 --> 48:42.099
Planning an ambush.

48:42.101 --> 48:43.633
We gotta get a vantage
point on those damn spiders,

48:43.635 --> 48:45.103
figure out where they're at.

48:45.105 --> 48:47.539
Where they're grouping,
where they're going to.

48:47.541 --> 48:49.376
Get the stragglers
and the weak ones.

48:51.244 --> 48:52.476
How about you?

48:52.478 --> 48:54.677
How'd you end up
running this team?

48:54.679 --> 48:56.546
Uh...

48:56.548 --> 48:59.217
My team was attacked by
these things near San Diego.

48:59.219 --> 49:01.651
I'd been appointed to the DOD

49:01.653 --> 49:04.858
on scientific
special operations.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.360
My people died because
I hesitated on utilizing

49:09.362 --> 49:12.929
human assets in a war
we were already losing.

49:12.931 --> 49:18.204
I said retreat when
I should have said attack.

49:21.507 --> 49:24.141
I was the only
survivor that day.

49:24.143 --> 49:28.244
It made be a bit of an expert
with DIA, DOD and POTUS.

49:28.246 --> 49:31.014
We understand risk, Roth.

49:31.016 --> 49:33.485
It's all we have left.

49:37.222 --> 49:38.588
How's it looking?

49:38.590 --> 49:40.791
They're staying
together offshore

49:40.793 --> 49:42.459
but we got a few small groups
that are breaking off

49:42.461 --> 49:44.394
and they are headed into town.

49:44.396 --> 49:46.930
We're gonna get
a little company.

49:46.932 --> 49:48.499
It's gonna heat up here
pretty quick, guys!

49:48.501 --> 49:50.001
Let's go ahead and
get doctors back to lab!

49:50.003 --> 49:51.001
Copy that.

49:51.003 --> 49:51.971
I'm not going back in.

49:54.507 --> 49:55.805
Absolutely not.

49:55.807 --> 49:58.541
It's way too dangerous
out there.

49:58.543 --> 49:59.675
They're everywhere.

49:59.677 --> 50:01.278
We'll get you your spider.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.914
Back to the lab.
Let's go.

50:02.916 --> 50:05.483
And what if you can't get
a spider back to the lab?

50:05.485 --> 50:07.985
What if I need to take a
tissue sample from the field?

50:07.987 --> 50:10.121
Are you familiar with
taking tissue samples

50:10.123 --> 50:12.759
from the field and gathering
them yourself, Mr. Russo?

50:15.128 --> 50:17.729
Lee, Wright.
Check that.

50:17.731 --> 50:19.729
We'll take Dr. Roth
back to lab,

50:19.731 --> 50:22.432
and we will head back out.

50:22.434 --> 50:24.267
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

50:24.269 --> 50:25.735
It's a waste of valuable time.

50:25.737 --> 50:28.607
Besides, I could stay here
and help out Horowitz.

50:30.309 --> 50:31.811
There! There!

50:33.413 --> 50:34.679
Mom! Mom!

50:34.681 --> 50:37.650
- (monsters chittering)
- Sam, run! Run!

50:46.759 --> 50:48.327
Go! Go!

50:54.199 --> 50:55.833
(Sam whimpers)

50:55.835 --> 50:57.336
Okay, okay.

51:00.407 --> 51:01.539
Mom?

51:01.541 --> 51:03.474
It's okay. We just...

51:03.476 --> 51:05.909
We just need
to find a locked room.

51:05.911 --> 51:07.547
Come on!
Come on!

51:17.822 --> 51:19.458
Russo!

51:21.494 --> 51:24.126
I got activity in front
of that house.

51:24.128 --> 51:26.532
I don't like this.

51:28.467 --> 51:29.766
- Easy! Easy!
- I got 'em!

51:29.768 --> 51:31.267
- Stand down.
- I can take 'em!

51:31.269 --> 51:32.670
Stand down!

51:32.672 --> 51:34.938
Whoa!

51:34.940 --> 51:38.309
We do not have the firepower
or the manpower

51:38.311 --> 51:40.311
to take these things on
in numbers.

51:40.313 --> 51:43.546
They're tearing this guy up,
you kidding me?

51:43.548 --> 51:46.550
Anything happens to you
or Dr. Horowitz,

51:46.552 --> 51:48.387
this mission is a failure.

51:49.922 --> 51:53.124
Our best shot is to get
one of these spiders alone,

51:53.126 --> 51:54.861
preferably dead.

51:56.563 --> 51:59.932
We can't get into a firefight
with these things in numbers.

52:05.036 --> 52:06.105
Look!

52:18.751 --> 52:20.918
- Wright, stay with 'em.
- Got it.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.423
- Lee, stay tight.
- On you.

52:44.909 --> 52:46.879
- Lee.
- I see 'em.

52:52.684 --> 52:55.251
- I got one by itself.
- Got two to the left!

52:55.253 --> 52:57.521
On my five!

52:57.523 --> 52:58.988
Three, one!

52:58.990 --> 53:01.527
(gunfire)
(monsters shriek)

53:04.096 --> 53:05.695
(monster shrieks)

53:05.697 --> 53:07.496
HOROWITZ: Help!
We need help!

53:07.498 --> 53:09.101
- On it!
- Wright!

53:14.206 --> 53:16.075
What happened?

53:20.512 --> 53:22.211
Roth! Roth!
Get back here!

53:22.213 --> 53:23.615
Where are you going?

53:24.851 --> 53:27.686
Russo! Wright is down!
Roth is coming to you!

53:36.228 --> 53:38.762
How'd you learn
to shoot like that?

53:38.764 --> 53:40.863
I'm from New York.

53:40.865 --> 53:42.936
Come on.
Let's bag this thing up.

53:46.972 --> 53:48.641
In the back.

53:59.385 --> 54:00.450
Move!

54:00.452 --> 54:02.489
Go! Go!

54:03.621 --> 54:07.759
(monsters chittering)

54:08.960 --> 54:10.961
Okay.
We'll be okay.

54:10.963 --> 54:13.063
What if those weird
spider things get in here?

54:13.065 --> 54:16.633
Or another like monster comes
and destroys this building?

54:16.635 --> 54:18.302
Sam?

54:18.304 --> 54:20.537
Sam, we're not
gonna freak out, okay?

54:20.539 --> 54:23.340
Look at me.
Take a breath.

54:23.342 --> 54:24.941
Okay.

54:24.943 --> 54:27.543
Your father's gonna
find us, okay?

54:27.545 --> 54:28.681
Got it?

54:37.322 --> 54:39.389
I'm gonna apply
a little bit of pressure.

54:39.391 --> 54:40.824
It might sting a little bit.

54:40.826 --> 54:42.793
- Bring it on.
- Relax.

54:42.795 --> 54:45.628
Relax?
Hammer is dead!

54:45.630 --> 54:46.863
We need to get
back out there...

54:46.865 --> 54:48.532
You need to calm down!

54:48.534 --> 54:51.601
I'd really recommend
you relax for a day or two.

54:51.603 --> 54:53.769
To hell with that.

54:53.771 --> 54:55.271
I need to get
back out there now!

54:55.273 --> 54:56.807
Are the Bots ready?

54:56.809 --> 54:58.577
We'll have our chance.

55:01.246 --> 55:02.813
He's dead.

55:02.815 --> 55:04.751
I want them dead.

55:06.818 --> 55:08.755
We knew what
we signed up for.

55:12.190 --> 55:14.092
I just can't
believe he's gone.

55:16.061 --> 55:17.293
(Badger sighs)

55:17.295 --> 55:18.998
I'm not gonna cry.

55:20.364 --> 55:22.100
I'm not gonna cry.

55:23.902 --> 55:25.601
Let me take another look.

55:25.603 --> 55:26.836
No. I need to go now.

55:26.838 --> 55:28.304
I can't release you.

55:28.306 --> 55:31.108
I'm not asking you.

55:31.110 --> 55:33.876
Then you're gonna have
to sign some paperwork.

55:33.878 --> 55:35.681
Where's the damn pen?

55:49.329 --> 55:50.363
Doc.

55:51.429 --> 55:53.430
On three, on three.

55:53.432 --> 55:54.932
One, two, three.

55:54.934 --> 55:58.635
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

55:58.637 --> 55:59.737
Okay. Drop it, guys.
Drop it.

55:59.739 --> 56:01.604
No, we gotta leave it outside.

56:01.606 --> 56:03.273
We still don't know if this
thing's giving anything off.

56:03.275 --> 56:05.041
I don't want to contaminate
the facility.

56:05.043 --> 56:06.809
Let's just bring all
my equipment out here.

56:06.811 --> 56:08.579
All right, got it.
On three, on three.

56:08.581 --> 56:09.849
Three, two.

56:12.952 --> 56:14.617
This is Russo,
this is Russo.

56:14.619 --> 56:18.357
I need you to bring down
Dr. Horowitz's equipment ASAP.

56:19.724 --> 56:20.860
Repeat?

56:24.295 --> 56:25.795
You gotta be kidding me.

56:25.797 --> 56:28.034
- Really?
- Copy.

56:31.570 --> 56:33.604
You've got a phone call.

56:33.606 --> 56:36.643
I just lost a friend to one of
these things. Make it quick.

56:38.510 --> 56:39.844
Hello?

56:39.846 --> 56:42.179
Larry, where the hell
are you, man?

56:42.181 --> 56:44.146
I'm on the way back in.

56:44.148 --> 56:46.182
Listen, man, before
that boat went down,

56:46.184 --> 56:49.253
<i>we got a definite area on where
those things are coming from.</i>

56:49.255 --> 56:51.787
But we got an attack sub
out here ready to go nuclear

56:51.789 --> 56:53.456
and blow these things out!

56:53.458 --> 56:56.260
Do you have any idea
how big the tidal waves

56:56.262 --> 56:57.559
that thing would create?

56:57.561 --> 56:59.195
I get it, I get it.

56:59.197 --> 57:00.831
All right,
what else do you have?

57:00.833 --> 57:03.733
There's much more,
a whole lot more.

57:03.735 --> 57:05.534
There's fucking more
of these things?

57:05.536 --> 57:07.773
Yeah, well, you're the one
who predicted it, right?

57:09.007 --> 57:10.740
I wish I was wrong
about that one.

57:10.742 --> 57:14.644
I know, but what are you guys
doing about these spiders?

57:14.646 --> 57:15.912
And what about the Armada?

57:15.914 --> 57:17.213
We nabbed one of the spiders.

57:17.215 --> 57:19.148
Horowitz is trying
to figure out a pathogen

57:19.150 --> 57:20.950
<i>to kill these things off,
and I'm gonna figure out a way</i>

57:20.952 --> 57:22.885
to adapt it
to the Armadas and deploy it.

57:22.887 --> 57:25.121
Sounds like a plan.

57:25.123 --> 57:27.291
All right, I'll keep you
posted as I know it.

57:27.293 --> 57:29.860
Great.
Glad you're alive.

57:29.862 --> 57:31.864
Me, too.

57:34.699 --> 57:36.168
You done?

57:40.739 --> 57:42.238
There's more?

57:42.240 --> 57:43.175
Yeah.

57:44.409 --> 57:46.543
What do you think?

57:46.545 --> 57:49.079
I think they look like
ordinary arachnids, you know.

57:49.081 --> 57:51.215
With the exception to
their size, of course.

57:51.217 --> 57:54.217
That could be due
to radiation or, you know,

57:54.219 --> 57:56.153
we just discovered
a new species.

57:56.155 --> 57:59.555
I won't know anything for sure
until I cut that thing open.

57:59.557 --> 58:01.191
Let's go.

58:01.193 --> 58:03.726
Mr. Secretary, I understand
nobody was prepared.

58:03.728 --> 58:05.595
Yeah, okay.

58:05.597 --> 58:09.465
Look, if you need to mobilize
more ground troops, then do it!

58:09.467 --> 58:13.369
General, Dr. Horowitz's
equipment is set up, sir.

58:13.371 --> 58:15.340
Copy.

58:23.715 --> 58:27.286
(equipment trilling)

58:28.621 --> 58:29.756
Hmm.

58:32.757 --> 58:34.557
Let's see.

58:34.559 --> 58:37.059
Okay, so radiation levels
seem to be normal

58:37.061 --> 58:39.262
and it's not emitting
any kind of toxins either.

58:39.264 --> 58:41.134
Well, that's good news.

58:43.001 --> 58:45.837
All right, so let's
take a look inside you.

58:53.478 --> 58:55.247
That thing stinks.

58:56.748 --> 58:59.450
Huh. Well,
this is interesting.

58:59.452 --> 59:03.854
There are definitely organs
I can't identify here.

59:03.856 --> 59:06.456
I mean, usually with these
things, you can figure them out

59:06.458 --> 59:08.025
if you have a general
working knowledge of

59:08.027 --> 59:10.096
how the organism works,
but this...

59:14.867 --> 59:17.166
Guys, this isn't
carbon-based.

59:17.168 --> 59:20.871
All life on earth
is carbon-based.

59:20.873 --> 59:21.972
What are you saying,
Doctor?

59:21.974 --> 59:23.173
These things are
not from earth?

59:23.175 --> 59:24.775
Whoa.

59:24.777 --> 59:28.177
So if these things aren't from
earth, then they're aliens.

59:28.179 --> 59:30.246
Well, if you have
another hypothesis,

59:30.248 --> 59:31.949
- I would love to hear it.
- Come on.

59:31.951 --> 59:33.416
Regardless
whether they're aliens,

59:33.418 --> 59:35.651
the issue at hand
is stopping these things!

59:35.653 --> 59:37.121
Of course, General.

59:37.123 --> 59:39.222
Keep me informed, please.

59:39.224 --> 59:41.958
I need to update the
White House on our progress.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.894
Okay, so you see
this gland here?

59:43.896 --> 59:45.295
Yeah.

59:45.297 --> 59:46.996
So usually this would be
used to expel salt

59:46.998 --> 59:48.632
from the body, right?

59:48.634 --> 59:50.367
But it seems to be covered with
to what I can only refer to

59:50.369 --> 59:53.503
as some sort of reverse
plasma membrane.

59:53.505 --> 59:56.305
- It's like crystallized salt.
- Yes.

59:56.307 --> 59:59.242
This organ is
definitely storing salt.

59:59.244 --> 01:00:02.545
Which actually
would make a lot of sense

01:00:02.547 --> 01:00:04.880
because the reverse plasma
membranes are probably

01:00:04.882 --> 01:00:08.017
drawing in sodium from the ocean
in which it's living in.

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:09.485
It's being stored
in its glands

01:00:09.487 --> 01:00:11.854
and it's rereleasing it
back into its system,

01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:13.289
just like our body does
with insulin.

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:17.161
Kind of like camels
storing fat in its hump?

01:00:17.163 --> 01:00:18.695
Right.
That's a good analogy.

01:00:18.697 --> 01:00:21.063
This is good news
because if I can find a way

01:00:21.065 --> 01:00:23.766
to actually destroy
these membranes,

01:00:23.768 --> 01:00:25.702
it would be a much better
alternative than creating

01:00:25.704 --> 01:00:27.970
a pathogen that would actually
pollute the environment

01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:32.010
and run the risk of
hurting the population.

01:00:33.478 --> 01:00:34.610
Excuse me.

01:00:34.612 --> 01:00:35.912
This is <i>Intrepid Gull,</i>

01:00:35.914 --> 01:00:37.380
closing in on
the new sonar activity.

01:00:37.382 --> 01:00:40.784
Guys, I think there is
something else under here!

01:00:40.786 --> 01:00:42.255
I'm outta here.

01:00:43.554 --> 01:00:45.387
Come on, baby, come on.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:46.491
Come on!

01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:55.567
Come on, keep it going.
Keep it going.

01:00:56.835 --> 01:00:59.137
Come on, let's go.

01:01:00.271 --> 01:01:01.737
Ah!

01:01:01.739 --> 01:01:04.740
The U.S.S. <i>Radiant</i> is
closing in on the location

01:01:04.742 --> 01:01:08.711
the <i>Intrepid Gull</i> locked on
before it was destroyed.

01:01:08.713 --> 01:01:11.481
The nuclear weapons are armed.

01:01:11.483 --> 01:01:13.952
Maybe this could be
the way out.

01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:16.989
You know what I think.

01:01:19.992 --> 01:01:22.094
(sonar pings)

01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:29.831
Atlantic Command, this is
Commanding Officer Sterling

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:31.568
of the U.S.S. <i>Radiant.</i>

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.639
You seeing these images?

01:01:38.242 --> 01:01:39.742
<i>Atlantic Command.
Affirmative,</i> Radiant.

01:01:39.744 --> 01:01:41.610
<i>You are clear
to sweep and destroy.</i>

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:44.014
<i>I say again, you're clear
to sweep and destroy.</i>

01:01:44.016 --> 01:01:45.581
Copy that, Atlantic Command.

01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.419
<i>Complying with orders
to sweep and destroy.</i>

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.894
Forward torpedo room,
I need tubes one through four

01:01:57.896 --> 01:02:01.463
ready to go with
MOD7 CBASS immediately.

01:02:01.465 --> 01:02:04.536
<i>Copy, Command.
MOD7 CBASS, copy.</i>

01:02:09.275 --> 01:02:11.510
Prepare for launch
on my mark.

01:02:15.313 --> 01:02:18.216
And three... two...

01:02:20.184 --> 01:02:21.653
one, mark!

01:02:28.793 --> 01:02:30.392
Or not.

01:02:30.394 --> 01:02:32.030
You gotta be kidding me.

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.599
It was destroyed.

01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:38.235
There's another
creature out there.

01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:39.936
Creatures.

01:02:39.938 --> 01:02:42.871
I need to know if Dr. Horowitz
has figured out a way

01:02:42.873 --> 01:02:45.173
to destroy these things.

01:02:45.175 --> 01:02:48.313
And I need those Armadas
right now!

01:02:49.847 --> 01:02:51.150
Copy.

01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:06.128
And that is
how we kill them.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.197
The spiders are okay.

01:03:08.199 --> 01:03:10.999
But what's the possibility we
have another larger creature?

01:03:11.001 --> 01:03:13.670
Well, I mean, my assumption
is since the spiders came

01:03:13.672 --> 01:03:15.505
from the larger creature
in the first place,

01:03:15.507 --> 01:03:17.907
they probably share the same
genetic makeup and organs,

01:03:17.909 --> 01:03:20.245
so I don't see
why they wouldn't.

01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:26.048
The Armadas will be
the best option

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:27.583
for deploying this agent.

01:03:27.585 --> 01:03:28.584
Do you agree?

01:03:28.586 --> 01:03:30.354
Absolutely.

01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:32.222
But how do we deploy this?

01:03:32.224 --> 01:03:34.023
- The flame units.
- Hmm, brilliant.

01:03:34.025 --> 01:03:35.358
I just have to tweak
them a bit.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.028
Okay.
Let's get on it ASAP.

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.831
Keep us apprised, Doctor.
We don't have much time.

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.735
No time, for that matter.

01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:49.171
You sure this is gonna work?

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:50.775
It's all we've got.

01:03:52.644 --> 01:03:54.280
Is that what
you're looking for?

01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:56.979
Yeah.

01:03:56.981 --> 01:03:58.248
We could use a bigger one...

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.483
22 or 24...
but it'll do for now.

01:04:00.485 --> 01:04:01.487
Okay.

01:04:04.657 --> 01:04:06.322
Hey...

01:04:06.324 --> 01:04:10.293
Thank you for working with me.

01:04:10.295 --> 01:04:12.061
I'm glad we got
to work together.

01:04:12.063 --> 01:04:14.799
Even if it's the last day
we're alive.

01:04:18.869 --> 01:04:21.339
(sighs)

01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:30.012
Okay, Mr. Russo.

01:04:30.014 --> 01:04:32.884
Let me know when you see
the igniter light go out.

01:04:36.822 --> 01:04:38.487
All right, it's off!

01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:41.258
Aerial and naval surveillance
have just confirmed

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.825
two bogies moving toward shore.

01:04:42.827 --> 01:04:43.959
Two?

01:04:43.961 --> 01:04:45.364
Jesus!

01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:49.434
(growling)

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:54.306
(chittering)

01:05:07.853 --> 01:05:09.351
Like a glove.

01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:10.854
(sighs)

01:05:10.856 --> 01:05:12.822
That should do it.
Locked and loaded!

01:05:12.824 --> 01:05:14.958
<i>I suggest that
we keep one as a backup.</i>

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.226
That sounds good to me.

01:05:17.228 --> 01:05:19.929
Very well.

01:05:19.931 --> 01:05:21.630
So is it ready?

01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:24.066
As ready as it's gonna be.

01:05:24.068 --> 01:05:25.635
Where's the pilots?

01:05:25.637 --> 01:05:28.271
I can't stand this
waiting around stuff.

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:29.575
It drives me nuts.

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:40.416
Bugs? Badger?

01:05:40.418 --> 01:05:42.385
<i>Need you down
in the hangar ASAP!</i>

01:05:42.387 --> 01:05:43.619
Finally!

01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:46.791
Bugs, wake up.
It's time to go.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.595
Bugs, get your ass up!
It's time to go!

01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:54.865
Bugs!

01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:56.633
Bugs!
Oh my God!

01:05:56.635 --> 01:05:58.034
Russo!

01:05:58.036 --> 01:06:00.503
Bugs, Badger, I need you
down here ASAP, ASAP!

01:06:00.505 --> 01:06:02.204
Russo, you need
to get down here!

01:06:02.206 --> 01:06:03.572
There's something wrong
with Bugs!

01:06:03.574 --> 01:06:06.511
I turned her around
and she's like...

01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:10.347
What the hell?

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:12.985
Russo, why won't
the door open?

01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:22.059
I am losing
good men right now!

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.525
What the hell is going on?!

01:06:23.527 --> 01:06:24.994
We have to quarantine them.

01:06:24.996 --> 01:06:26.396
We're not letting them
out of there.

01:06:26.398 --> 01:06:28.130
- She caught a contagion.
- All right.

01:06:28.132 --> 01:06:29.499
If we don't have any pilots
to fly the Armadas,

01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:31.166
how are we gonna
stop these things?

01:06:31.168 --> 01:06:32.568
Wait.

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:34.204
Do you mean to
tell me, General,

01:06:34.206 --> 01:06:35.505
that we don't have
any pilots left?

01:06:35.507 --> 01:06:37.340
We do, but not
at this location.

01:06:37.342 --> 01:06:39.075
I mean, this was
all so sudden.

01:06:39.077 --> 01:06:40.677
We were
extremely unprepared.

01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:42.311
It's gotta be me.

01:06:42.313 --> 01:06:46.249
Doc, can anybody get
into those damn things?

01:06:46.251 --> 01:06:47.516
Are you brain-mapped?

01:06:47.518 --> 01:06:49.017
No. That is why I'm asking.

01:06:49.019 --> 01:06:50.619
Yes, you do.

01:06:50.621 --> 01:06:51.887
We can outfit you
with Bugs's rig,

01:06:51.889 --> 01:06:54.458
but the lag time
will be even greater.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.358
Everyone's brain mapping
is slightly different

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.195
and I have no idea how the
Armada's gonna work for you.

01:06:59.197 --> 01:07:00.729
We have no other choice.

01:07:00.731 --> 01:07:03.233
Put me in the damn thing.
Just put me in there.

01:07:03.235 --> 01:07:04.833
I'll take the other one.

01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:07.470
No. I need you to stay down
here and watch my back, okay?

01:07:07.472 --> 01:07:09.371
No, I'm gonna pilot
the other Armada.

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.507
I cannot put you in
control of

01:07:10.509 --> 01:07:12.642
a billion dollar
robot, Doctor.

01:07:12.644 --> 01:07:17.079
General, the Armada's AI
works off of our brain impulse.

01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:18.615
I'm already brain-mapped.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:20.217
I have the least
amount of lag time.

01:07:20.219 --> 01:07:21.517
No.

01:07:21.519 --> 01:07:22.918
Quite frankly,
we have no other choice!

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.320
We can't send
this man up alone.

01:07:25.322 --> 01:07:27.826
No. Let someone else do it.

01:07:30.195 --> 01:07:31.293
You worried about me,
Horowitz?

01:07:31.295 --> 01:07:33.963
Maybe...

01:07:33.965 --> 01:07:36.365
And it's Andrea.

01:07:36.367 --> 01:07:38.003
J.P.

01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:42.438
What's that stand for?

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.941
If I come back alive,
I'll let you know.

01:07:44.943 --> 01:07:47.809
Then come back alive.

01:07:47.811 --> 01:07:49.080
Kill them.

01:07:50.315 --> 01:07:52.949
- So you guys are ready?
- All set.

01:07:52.951 --> 01:07:55.788
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Let's suit up!

01:08:56.413 --> 01:08:58.680
RUSSO: <i>Lee,
are you in position?</i>

01:08:58.682 --> 01:09:01.349
Affirmative.
I have eyes on the target.

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.518
RUSSO: <i>Roger.
ETA two minutes.</i>

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.952
Copy that.

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:05.520
RUSSO: <i>Make sure
the targets are tagged</i>

01:09:05.523 --> 01:09:07.158
<i>before we get there.</i>

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:13.830
Russo, change your
L sat to 070328!

01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:16.899
RUSSO: <i>Standing by
for activation.</i>

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:19.738
<i>Got it.
Signal loud and clear.</i>

01:09:20.904 --> 01:09:22.839
This should make it easier

01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:23.839
<i>for the missiles
to hit the target.</i>

01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:25.743
<i>Go get 'em, Russo.</i>

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.615
RUSSO: <i>Doc, make sure
you stay behind me!</i>

01:09:31.617 --> 01:09:33.450
<i>I'll take the brunt
of all the attacks!</i>

01:09:33.452 --> 01:09:35.285
<i>When I give the word,
you go ahead</i>

01:09:35.287 --> 01:09:37.152
<i>and deploy the aerosol attack!
You got that?</i>

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:38.756
ROTH: <i>Will do.</i>

01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:46.228
<i>Are you seeing what
we're seeing down here?</i>

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:48.764
ROTH: <i>Wow! What the hell
are they doing?</i>

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:49.832
HOROWITZ: <i>All the spiders
are attaching themselves</i>

01:09:49.835 --> 01:09:51.500
<i>to a larger creature.</i>

01:09:51.502 --> 01:09:53.568
RUSSO: <i>All right now,
stay back. Don't get eager.</i>

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.175
<i>Let me take the pass first,
and we'll see how they react.</i>

01:10:00.311 --> 01:10:01.777
ROTH: <i>Russo. watch out!</i>

01:10:01.779 --> 01:10:03.549
<i>The big one is
going for you!</i>

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.190
(growls)

01:10:13.425 --> 01:10:15.458
I'm coming in, Russo!

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.095
RUSSO: <i>Negative! Stay back!</i>

01:10:25.369 --> 01:10:27.403
ROTH: <i>Mr. Russo, you've
got a lot of spiders</i>

01:10:27.405 --> 01:10:28.704
<i>headed your way!</i>

01:10:28.706 --> 01:10:30.106
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Doc.

01:10:30.108 --> 01:10:34.546
But this damn AI,
serious lag, serious lag.

01:10:36.247 --> 01:10:37.983
(chittering)

01:10:45.957 --> 01:10:48.227
God, it's like moving
through mud!

01:10:55.265 --> 01:10:56.268
Just say the word!

01:11:01.372 --> 01:11:03.304
RUSSO:
<i>Now! Deploy it now!</i>

01:11:03.306 --> 01:11:05.810
Okay, I'm there!

01:11:10.715 --> 01:11:14.250
What? What?
It's not working!

01:11:14.252 --> 01:11:16.486
RUSSO: <i>Doc, you're clear
to use the flamethrower!</i>

01:11:16.488 --> 01:11:18.720
<i>Use the damn flamethrower!</i>

01:11:18.722 --> 01:11:20.024
It's not working!

01:11:22.961 --> 01:11:24.930
The flamethrower's down!

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.203
RUSSO: <i>Doc, move!</i>

01:11:33.471 --> 01:11:35.206
Oh!

01:11:41.345 --> 01:11:42.547
Ah!

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.753
Thank you.

01:11:50.755 --> 01:11:52.287
RUSSO: <i>Have you figured out</i>

01:11:52.289 --> 01:11:53.690
<i>what's wrong with
the weapon system yet?</i>

01:11:53.692 --> 01:11:54.857
No.

01:11:54.859 --> 01:11:56.526
No, it's still down!

01:11:56.528 --> 01:11:57.927
RUSSO: <i>Well, you gotta
stay clear</i>

01:11:57.929 --> 01:11:59.297
<i>until you figure out
how to fix it!</i>

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.900
Agh!

01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:05.304
Damn it!

01:12:15.747 --> 01:12:18.650
All right, I am low on ammo.
I am low on ammo.

01:12:21.886 --> 01:12:23.718
Fall back while using
the rockets.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.887
Stay at a safe distance.

01:12:24.889 --> 01:12:26.321
I repeat,
stay at a safe distance!

01:12:26.323 --> 01:12:27.322
Copy that?

01:12:27.324 --> 01:12:28.659
ROTH: <i>Gotcha.</i>

01:12:37.068 --> 01:12:39.271
Come on, let's go!
Come on!

01:12:47.545 --> 01:12:49.512
Yeah! Come on!

01:12:49.514 --> 01:12:51.013
Let's go!

01:12:51.015 --> 01:12:54.083
<i>How are we going
on the flamethrower, Doc?</i>

01:12:54.085 --> 01:12:55.951
ROTH:
<i>Nothing is working.</i>

01:12:55.953 --> 01:12:57.352
<i>I don't know if it's
going to happen.</i>

01:12:57.354 --> 01:12:59.955
Fix that damn flamethrower!
Put it online!

01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:01.659
We gotta get that
damn thing online!

01:13:10.335 --> 01:13:13.635
Oh, for... Please tell me
you're seeing this.

01:13:13.637 --> 01:13:14.872
Yes.

01:13:17.207 --> 01:13:20.211
Giant Killer, are you
getting this feed?

01:13:22.747 --> 01:13:25.246
Yes, Mr. Russo!
We see it!

01:13:25.248 --> 01:13:28.219
It looks like they're
killing each other.

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.260
What the hell is it?

01:13:38.429 --> 01:13:40.429
Roth, what you thinking?

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:43.034
I have no idea.

01:13:47.505 --> 01:13:48.771
It's recombining.

01:13:48.773 --> 01:13:50.406
What the hell
does that mean?

01:13:50.408 --> 01:13:53.808
It's got
recombinant proteins.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.313
It's becoming one organism.

01:13:58.783 --> 01:14:00.819
I think you're right.

01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:10.293
RUSSO:
<i>Dr. Roth, get back!</i>

01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:11.229
<i>Get back!</i>

01:14:19.136 --> 01:14:20.871
(grunts)

01:14:23.073 --> 01:14:24.706
<i>Doc, I need you to stay
as far back from this thing</i>

01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:26.909
<i>as possible until you
figure out what the hell</i>

01:14:26.911 --> 01:14:28.577
<i>is going on with
that weapons system!</i>

01:14:28.579 --> 01:14:30.044
<i>You copy that?</i>

01:14:30.046 --> 01:14:31.449
ROTH: <i>Yeah, yeah,
I do, Mr. Russo.</i>

01:14:33.951 --> 01:14:36.152
Dr. Roth, have you
figured another way

01:14:36.154 --> 01:14:37.687
to release
the pathogens yet?

01:14:37.689 --> 01:14:39.925
No, not yet.

01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:44.793
Give me the backup canister.
I'm going out there.

01:14:44.795 --> 01:14:46.262
No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:46.264 --> 01:14:47.528
You're not
going out there alone.

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.464
That's suicide.

01:14:49.466 --> 01:14:50.801
I'm going.

01:14:52.269 --> 01:14:54.370
All right, I'll go with you.
I'll escort you.

01:14:54.372 --> 01:14:56.673
I'll keep you safe.
You're getting back.

01:14:56.675 --> 01:14:58.107
Okay?

01:14:58.109 --> 01:15:00.710
Protect her, Lee.
She's our last resort.

01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:02.077
Yes, sir.

01:15:02.079 --> 01:15:03.280
Come on.

01:15:21.533 --> 01:15:23.135
Move!

01:15:47.759 --> 01:15:50.494
(screams)

01:16:02.739 --> 01:16:05.741
My leg! It's burning through!

01:16:05.743 --> 01:16:07.309
It's burning through the suit.

01:16:07.311 --> 01:16:09.146
Please tell me you
got it online!

01:16:13.752 --> 01:16:15.250
Tell me you got
the weapons back online.

01:16:15.252 --> 01:16:17.253
Tell me you got the weapons
back online.

01:16:17.255 --> 01:16:20.455
Negative,
but I have an idea!

01:16:20.457 --> 01:16:22.224
I'm gonna jam this
flamethrower's arm

01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:24.360
down this thing's neck.

01:16:24.362 --> 01:16:28.062
The acid should eat its
way through the fuselage

01:16:28.064 --> 01:16:29.999
and release the aerosol.

01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:32.204
(chuckles)

01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:36.972
That's crazy, Roth.
That's crazy.

01:16:36.974 --> 01:16:39.141
All right.

01:16:39.143 --> 01:16:40.976
I got it, I got it,
I got an idea.

01:16:40.978 --> 01:16:42.510
ROTH: <i>Hold up, guys!</i>

01:16:42.512 --> 01:16:44.780
<i>No need for the backup
canister just yet.</i>

01:16:44.782 --> 01:16:46.848
<i>Let me try this first.</i>

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:48.217
Roth, are you sure?

01:16:48.219 --> 01:16:49.250
I don't like this.

01:16:49.252 --> 01:16:50.686
This thing is way too strong.

01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:52.388
You might want to consider
weakening it first.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.123
ROTH: <i>And how do you
suggest we do this?</i>

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:55.424
<i>Missiles aren't
exactly accomplishing that,</i>

01:16:55.426 --> 01:16:57.160
<i>and I don't know
what will.</i>

01:16:57.162 --> 01:16:58.494
RUSSO: <i>I know what
will do it,</i>

01:16:58.496 --> 01:17:00.228
<i>just gotta be direct
and precise.</i>

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:01.664
LEE: <i>Russo,
I don't like that tone.</i>

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:03.465
<i>That's what you
said in Tripoli, man.</i>

01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:05.002
(cell phone beeps)

01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:08.537
- What is it?
- Karen.

01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:09.705
Your wife?

01:17:09.707 --> 01:17:11.240
Yeah, looks like
she's in a building

01:17:11.242 --> 01:17:12.241
half a mile away from here.

01:17:12.243 --> 01:17:13.942
Let's go get her.

01:17:13.944 --> 01:17:15.811
LEE: <i>No, we need to be
Roth and Russo's backup.</i>

01:17:15.813 --> 01:17:19.117
RUSSO: <i>Lee, we got this.
Go get your wife and daughter.</i>

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.527
Here's what
we gotta do first.

01:17:32.529 --> 01:17:35.563
I'm gonna ram into
that son of a bitch,

01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:37.532
and then you gotta
finish the job.

01:17:37.534 --> 01:17:39.335
That's not necessary, Russo.

01:17:39.337 --> 01:17:41.035
Just hang in there.
I'm coming in!

01:17:41.037 --> 01:17:42.571
Shut up!

01:17:42.573 --> 01:17:44.175
Just do what the hell
I'm telling you!

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:50.345
Go on my signal,
on my signal.

01:17:50.347 --> 01:17:51.315
Ready?

01:17:57.253 --> 01:17:59.490
Okay.
Here we go.

01:18:00.692 --> 01:18:02.223
Russo, no!

01:18:02.225 --> 01:18:04.727
That's all you got? Huh?

01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:05.963
Two...

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.037
(roars)

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.143
No!

01:18:22.012 --> 01:18:23.545
What was that?

01:18:23.547 --> 01:18:25.416
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18:26.551 --> 01:18:27.983
I love you, sweetheart.

01:18:27.985 --> 01:18:30.020
I love you, too.

01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:37.893
Karen?

01:18:37.895 --> 01:18:40.432
Dad!
I knew you'd come!

01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:43.965
Alex.

01:18:43.967 --> 01:18:46.403
I knew you'd come.

01:18:48.439 --> 01:18:49.737
Is it over?

01:18:49.739 --> 01:18:51.072
Yeah.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:53.577
I have a car outside.
Let's go home.

01:18:59.182 --> 01:19:02.384
(grunts)

01:19:02.386 --> 01:19:04.722
ROTH: <i>Okay, I'm gonna ram
this down its throat.</i>

01:19:07.056 --> 01:19:08.460
(grunts)

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:15.233
Come on, baby!
Use your acid.

01:19:18.502 --> 01:19:20.171
(grunts)

01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:27.412
All right, come to mama!

01:19:31.481 --> 01:19:33.752
(grunts)

01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:43.495
Ugh!

01:19:54.805 --> 01:19:57.108
(chittering)

01:20:04.782 --> 01:20:06.214
Are they both okay?

01:20:06.216 --> 01:20:08.584
Safe and sound.
Thank you for that, Doctor.

01:20:08.586 --> 01:20:10.119
Okay, now we need
to get to Roth

01:20:10.121 --> 01:20:11.655
before the acid eats
through his cockpit.

01:20:13.157 --> 01:20:15.427
Hang on, Doc.
This could get squirrely.

01:20:17.194 --> 01:20:19.130
HOROWITZ:
Here, take a right.

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:33.378
Doc, get Roth.
I'll cover you from here.

01:20:46.024 --> 01:20:47.755
Dr. Roth?

01:20:47.757 --> 01:20:48.891
Dr. Roth?

01:20:48.893 --> 01:20:50.360
Dr. Roth?
Can you hear me?

01:20:54.765 --> 01:20:57.031
Dr. Roth?

01:20:57.033 --> 01:20:59.567
Dr. Roth,
can you hear me?

01:20:59.569 --> 01:21:00.803
Oh, fuck.

01:21:00.805 --> 01:21:02.474
(panting)

01:21:05.141 --> 01:21:07.108
Dr. Roth,
can you hear me?

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:08.477
Can you...

01:21:08.479 --> 01:21:11.046
Hey, it's me.
It's Andrea.

01:21:11.048 --> 01:21:12.880
What happened?

01:21:12.882 --> 01:21:16.818
You killed them.
That's what happened.

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.555
You're a hero.

01:21:20.324 --> 01:21:21.824
We got to get you
out of here, okay?

01:21:21.826 --> 01:21:24.695
Okay, come on.
Come on.

01:21:25.863 --> 01:21:27.731
(grunts)

01:21:30.833 --> 01:21:33.568
You're okay.

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:36.537
Come on, we gotta go quick.
Come on.

01:21:36.539 --> 01:21:37.609
Come on.

01:21:39.944 --> 01:21:42.380
Let's go, let's go.

01:22:15.378 --> 01:22:17.144
ROTH: James Patrick.

01:22:17.146 --> 01:22:18.146
What?

01:22:18.148 --> 01:22:19.682
That's my name.

01:22:19.684 --> 01:22:22.918
I told you I'd tell you
if I made it out alive.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.787
Well, James,
I'm glad you're not dead.

01:22:26.789 --> 01:22:27.926
Me, too.

01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:37.335
