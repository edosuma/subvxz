00:00.060 --> 00:01.720
<i>Previously on</i>
Black Lightning...

00:01.730 --> 00:03.490
Thirty years ago,
I came to Freeland

00:03.690 --> 00:06.295
As an agent for a government
organization called the ASA.

00:06.495 --> 00:08.900
<i>I helped them find
young people with abilities.</i>

00:09.100 --> 00:13.000
<i>But when I realized that the ASA's
vaccine was killing children,</i>

00:13.001 --> 00:14.870
I leaked the information
to your father,

00:15.070 --> 00:16.555
<i>And his investigation
got him killed.</i>

00:16.755 --> 00:18.240
<i>And they're doing it again.</i>

00:18.910 --> 00:21.310
<i>I saw one of your students
get snatched last night.</i>

00:21.510 --> 00:22.680
<i>Two men wearing black</i>

00:22.880 --> 00:25.150
<i>Jumped out of this van
and they grabbed her.</i>

00:25.350 --> 00:26.880
What's up?

00:28.250 --> 00:31.482
The head of the ASA for this area,
is looking for you.

00:31.682 --> 00:34.202
If you use your powers,
or you go out in the suit,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.872
<i>He will find you,
and they will kill you.</i>

00:36.873 --> 00:40.686
The guys we're going after,
they are beyond the law.

00:40.687 --> 00:45.100
<i>When we take down their lab,
it's like declaring war.</i>

00:45.300 --> 00:48.240
- Jefferson Pierce is Black Lightning.
- What?

00:48.440 --> 00:51.140
<i>He's been hiding
in plain sight all this time.</i>

00:51.340 --> 00:53.140
Right under your nose.

00:53.150 --> 00:54.610
Do you think
you can take him down?

00:55.380 --> 00:56.910
Yes.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.560 --> 01:11.330
Are they all stable
after the move?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.960
One of the older ones
is showing abnormalities.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.870
Internal temperature fluctuations
are affecting vital signs.

01:18.070 --> 01:19.800
How are you going to fix it?

01:19.810 --> 01:22.710
I think it's a result
of moving on back-to-back days.

01:22.910 --> 01:24.410
But now that we're powered up
in this location,

01:24.610 --> 01:28.110
A consistent pod temperature should
return the subject to a stable reading.

01:51.970 --> 01:54.000
Which way?
<i>Go left.</i>

02:02.210 --> 02:05.720
I want the pods
monitored 24 hours a day.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.350
I'm already under my quota.

02:08.550 --> 02:11.820
Lose one more, and I'll need to
acquire more subjects.

02:12.020 --> 02:12.820
Yes, ma'am.

02:20.130 --> 02:21.570
I can't see through it.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.300
Or maybe there's still a problem
with the electric vision.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.040
<i>The door's shielded.</i>

02:26.240 --> 02:28.000
<i>But I know what I saw on the feed
from that nuke tracker satellite.</i>

02:28.010 --> 02:31.110
An abnormal energy field definitely
moved in there yesterday.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.580
Dad, I got this.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.260
Kids aren't here.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.630
Whoa! This is a whole lot
of those pulse things.

02:48.830 --> 02:49.690
Launchers.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.330
That's a lot of weapons
that can take you out.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.670
<i>It must be what caused
the abnormal energy hit.</i>

02:54.870 --> 02:58.140
Jeff, if they're stockpiling
anti-Black Lightning weapons-

02:58.340 --> 03:00.240
Doesn't matter.
Where's the next spot?

03:01.510 --> 03:03.540
I don't have one.
Why? Use the satellite.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.680
<i>The ASA knows
about the satellite, too.</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:06.840
They must have found a way

03:06.850 --> 03:08.610
To cloak the pods' energy
in transit.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
I have an idea, but it'll
take me a day to set it up.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.480
<i>Come on back.</i>

03:15.890 --> 03:17.090
Not yet.

03:23.688 --> 03:28.118
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

03:32.828 --> 03:34.368
Yes, I'm just leaving.

03:35.368 --> 03:36.738
Most of them are stable.

03:37.908 --> 03:39.268
We're in danger
of losing one of them.

03:44.748 --> 03:47.108
An armory was blown up?

03:47.118 --> 03:49.018
No, I hadn't heard about that.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.888
They're clearly
looking for the pods.

03:52.918 --> 03:55.758
I understand the orders,
but, sir,

03:56.928 --> 03:58.228
I've known Jefferson
Pierce for years,

03:58.428 --> 04:01.528
There is absolutely no way
he's Black Lightning-

04:06.068 --> 04:07.628
I understand.

04:09.498 --> 04:11.568
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

04:20.077 --> 04:22.048
I'm sorry that didn't pan out.
I really thought-

04:22.248 --> 04:23.448
Yeah, I know.

04:25.448 --> 04:28.788
Look, even if they cloak the pods' energy,
I can still find it.

04:28.988 --> 04:31.288
I'll ping everything in the
city with a radio signal,

04:31.488 --> 04:33.088
And the energy signature
from the pods

04:33.098 --> 04:34.958
Will light up
when the radio pulse hits them.

04:36.098 --> 04:37.858
Let me know
if you find something.

04:37.868 --> 04:38.928
I'm gonna get out of this suit.

04:47.978 --> 04:49.478
God, look at you,
you look awful.

04:51.248 --> 04:52.448
Thanks for the compliment.

04:52.648 --> 04:54.808
No. That's a subperiosteal
hematoma.

04:54.818 --> 04:56.648
It's good to know that you're
paying attention in med school.

04:56.848 --> 04:58.348
No, this is serious.
Did you get it looked at?

04:59.548 --> 05:00.918
I've had enough
subperiosteal hematomas

05:01.118 --> 05:03.018
To know when I actually need
to get some help.

05:04.928 --> 05:06.458
What happened?

05:08.828 --> 05:09.898
The truth, please.

05:11.428 --> 05:12.728
Ask your dad.

05:15.268 --> 05:17.768
I will.
The ASA will be looking for us.

05:19.268 --> 05:20.638
All of us.

05:20.838 --> 05:23.678
Those weapons he blew up
are only good for one thing,

05:24.348 --> 05:25.748
Killing Black Lightning.

05:25.948 --> 05:27.798
Make sure he makes
good choices, okay?

05:27.998 --> 05:29.848
How exactly
am I supposed to do that?

05:30.048 --> 05:30.948
Trust your instincts.

05:31.148 --> 05:32.988
Come on.
Make it plain, Uncle Gambi.

05:33.188 --> 05:36.388
Anissa, look at your father
and your father's father.

05:37.328 --> 05:39.058
Protecting people
is in your blood.

05:39.258 --> 05:41.688
There are certain things
no one can train you for.

05:42.858 --> 05:45.268
Everything you need
is already inside you.

05:49.038 --> 05:50.038
Thanks.

06:07.688 --> 06:11.388
It seems a little suspicious.
Are you sure it's not a setup?

06:12.758 --> 06:15.398
If this was a setup,
you'd already be dead.

06:16.128 --> 06:17.698
Who the hell are you?

06:17.898 --> 06:19.798
You'll find everything you need in
the garbage can in front of you.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.268
You're right, glennon.
It stinks. Come on.

06:25.468 --> 06:30.308
Deputy chief Cayman,
I said in the garbage can.

06:31.048 --> 06:32.108
Do it.

06:36.248 --> 06:37.618
Oh.

06:41.388 --> 06:45.258
This needs to be legitimate, and fast.
Tomorrow, if possible?

06:47.398 --> 06:51.298
Okay, speedy warrants? Got it.
Who's the target?

06:53.768 --> 06:55.028
Jefferson Pierce.

07:02.678 --> 07:05.408
So, dad, what happened
to Uncle Gambi?

07:09.448 --> 07:12.768
He was tortured by his friends at
the ASA in order to get to me.

07:12.968 --> 07:16.288
Well, clearly, that didn't work
because you wouldn't be here.

07:17.288 --> 07:18.358
That is true.

07:19.058 --> 07:20.188
So you can trust him.

07:22.228 --> 07:23.298
Maybe.

07:24.628 --> 07:25.798
No. I'm not sure.

07:26.498 --> 07:27.998
Man, they did a good job.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.498
Yeah. It's what they do.

07:29.698 --> 07:32.388
I don't know. It's just weird right now,
being around you two.

07:32.588 --> 07:35.278
No, it is. It's like you're
working together, but not really.

07:35.478 --> 07:37.038
Yeah, I know.
It's weird for me, too.

07:37.578 --> 07:38.578
Mmm.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.978
So, he says the ASA
is gonna be looking to kill us.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.348
They are.
So then...

07:47.858 --> 07:49.558
I don't know,
shouldn't we all just get along?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.288
"Can we all just get along?"

07:53.298 --> 07:54.328
What?

07:54.528 --> 07:57.798
No. Rodney king asked,
"can we all get along?"

07:57.998 --> 08:01.998
See, it's an existential question
rather than a directive.

08:02.198 --> 08:03.898
Okay. So can we?

08:06.978 --> 08:08.038
I don't know.

08:53.458 --> 08:54.888
Damn it!

08:58.848 --> 09:00.283
Good morning.
Good morning.

09:00.483 --> 09:01.918
Good morning.
Mr. Pierce.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.118
Hey, lexton.

09:03.318 --> 09:06.358
Congratulations on the debate victory.
All right.

09:06.558 --> 09:08.278
You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm driving.

09:08.478 --> 09:09.998
Girl, that driver's license
is brand-new.

09:10.198 --> 09:12.298
And you are too hard on my nerves
for first thing in the morning.

09:12.498 --> 09:13.568
Shut up. I can drive.

09:13.768 --> 09:15.168
Girl-okay, we'll see.
I'd get us here quicker.

09:15.368 --> 09:16.398
I know that much.
You try then.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.338
All right, people,
another day to make magic.

09:19.538 --> 09:21.238
Yes, it is.

09:21.438 --> 09:22.938
Hey, dad.
Hey.

09:23.138 --> 09:24.078
Hey, dad, what's up?

09:24.278 --> 09:26.338
Keep an eye on your sister.
Uh-huh.

09:26.348 --> 09:29.108
And make sure you touch base
with me between classes.

09:29.118 --> 09:31.018
All right. Got it.
Anything else?

09:31.718 --> 09:33.548
Remember, I love you.

09:34.618 --> 09:35.888
I'll see you.
All right.

09:36.858 --> 09:37.888
Come on, people,
let's not be late.

09:38.088 --> 09:38.758
What's up, Mr. Jefferson?

09:38.958 --> 09:40.188
How are you doing?
How are you doing?

09:40.388 --> 09:43.998
All these young smiling faces,
young minds to be molded.

09:44.768 --> 09:46.058
Come on in.

09:46.068 --> 09:48.068
Well, I'd like to give
a shout-out to the mta

09:48.268 --> 09:49.468
For getting me here
on time today.

09:49.668 --> 09:52.598
Wait, wait. No.
No, no, no, that's fair.

09:52.608 --> 09:54.568
There are a lot of
hardworking men and women

09:54.578 --> 09:58.208
Who keep a very overworked
system running as best they can.

09:59.178 --> 10:00.278
Yeah.

10:00.478 --> 10:01.648
I've got a shout-out.

10:01.848 --> 10:05.278
To Mr. Winston, who let me
retake the Spanish mid-term.

10:06.288 --> 10:09.718
Bless up. Or <i> bendiga.</i>

10:12.088 --> 10:12.788
Tavon, you still with us?

10:13.458 --> 10:15.828
Five-o.
What?

10:32.748 --> 10:35.608
Blue Volvo wagon.
Double-time, guys. Come on.

10:37.718 --> 10:40.018
Damn, Mr. P. That's your car.

10:40.648 --> 10:42.248
Tavon, language.

10:42.258 --> 10:44.988
I mean, dang, Mr. P.
That's still your car.

10:46.058 --> 10:48.358
Homework out, everyone.
Let's...

10:51.398 --> 10:54.568
Let's focus,
and exchange homework.

10:55.798 --> 10:57.038
Girl, isn't that your dad's car?

11:13.788 --> 11:15.888
Every crack, every crevice.

11:24.428 --> 11:25.558
Oh.

11:25.568 --> 11:27.428
Surprise, surprise.

11:31.538 --> 11:35.768
Deputy chief Cayman, I would be happy
to follow you to the police station

11:35.778 --> 11:39.578
To straighten out whatever
misunderstanding there seems to be.

11:39.778 --> 11:40.978
We're almost done.

11:44.248 --> 11:45.648
Look, if you could tell me
what you're looking for...

11:47.348 --> 11:49.353
We found green light
in your car.

11:49.553 --> 11:51.558
Wait, what?
No. That's impossible.

11:51.758 --> 11:53.018
Oh!

11:54.928 --> 11:56.728
You got that green light, cuz?

11:56.928 --> 11:58.098
That is not mine.

11:59.168 --> 12:00.668
Mr. Pierce,
you're under arrest.

12:00.868 --> 12:02.698
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back.

12:02.898 --> 12:04.438
What? This is ridiculous.

12:04.638 --> 12:07.568
Are you resisting?
You can't come in here and just-

12:15.078 --> 12:16.878
I am not resisting.

12:17.718 --> 12:19.348
I am complying.

12:32.428 --> 12:33.398
Dad.

12:33.598 --> 12:35.998
No, honey,
it's a misunderstanding, honey.

12:36.198 --> 12:39.298
I just need to go with these
men and straighten it out.

12:39.308 --> 12:40.708
Everything will be fine.

12:43.478 --> 12:44.638
Jennifer...

12:46.208 --> 12:50.478
Jennifer, I need you to do
something very important for me.

12:51.548 --> 12:52.878
Jennifer.

12:54.448 --> 12:58.858
I need you to be calm,
really calm.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.228
Call your mother,
tell her what happened

13:07.428 --> 13:09.998
And be strong for your mother.
Can you do that for me?

13:15.078 --> 13:16.668
Let's go.

13:18.808 --> 13:20.608
Well, ya'll, not just gonna
take Mr. Pierce.

13:20.808 --> 13:22.608
Look, son, this ain't no rap video.
Step aside.

13:22.618 --> 13:24.218
Hey, look,
my daddy name is lamont,

13:24.418 --> 13:26.448
And you damn sure
don't look like a lamont.

13:26.648 --> 13:27.548
Tavon.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.388
No one wants to see another
black man in cuffs today.

13:33.258 --> 13:35.628
Well, you wanna help?
Keep doing what you're supposed to be doing

13:35.828 --> 13:37.028
And make sure all the other
students do the same.

13:37.228 --> 13:38.498
Can I count on you?

13:40.428 --> 13:42.328
I didn't hear you, tavon.

13:43.498 --> 13:45.668
Yes, sir.
You can count on me.

13:59.888 --> 14:00.818
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:01.018 --> 14:02.218
Stay back, miss.
Who do you think you are?

14:02.418 --> 14:03.348
You can't just take him-
stand back.

14:03.358 --> 14:05.388
No. Anissa. Anissa...
Dad...

14:05.588 --> 14:09.088
No! Get back in the school,
take care of everyone.

14:13.498 --> 14:14.768
Anissa.

14:17.338 --> 14:18.338
Don't touch me.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.098
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

15:11.108 --> 15:12.968
My job.
Yours, too, apparently.

15:13.938 --> 15:14.808
Get him processed
and put him in four.

15:19.078 --> 15:21.078
I wanna see the search warrant.

15:48.878 --> 15:52.048
Jefferson Pierce is one of the most
distinguished members of this community.

15:52.248 --> 15:53.948
Was. Then we discovered
he's a drug dealer

15:54.148 --> 15:55.118
Operating out of a school.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.578
I have to give him credit.
Smart way to corner the market.

15:57.588 --> 15:59.288
You don't believe that
your damn self.

15:59.488 --> 16:02.218
Tread lightly, inspector.
Don't be blinded by personal feelings.

16:02.418 --> 16:03.818
My eyes are wide open.

16:03.828 --> 16:06.488
Good. I'd hate to see
anything happen to you.

16:10.728 --> 16:13.768
You gotta bring ass to get ass.

16:15.338 --> 16:16.998
Don't forget that.

16:33.458 --> 16:37.358
<i>Thank you, students, for returning
to your lessons and activities.</i>

16:37.558 --> 16:39.988
<i>The school day
will continue as usual.</i>

16:41.458 --> 16:44.428
<i>I am actively seeking
an update on principal Pierce</i>

16:44.628 --> 16:48.838
<i>And will keep staff and students
informed as soon as we learn more.</i>

16:49.438 --> 16:50.838
<i>Until then,</i>

16:52.038 --> 16:54.508
Please, let's get
through this day in a way

16:54.708 --> 16:57.378
That will make
principal Pierce proud.

16:58.608 --> 17:02.548
Remember, you are the future.

18:17.358 --> 18:19.328
Yeah, okay. Okay!

18:28.268 --> 18:31.868
I'm surrounded by cops.
Is this really necessary?

18:45.918 --> 18:47.248
Open your mouth.

18:50.258 --> 18:51.318
Lift your tongue.

18:54.858 --> 18:56.598
Drop your clothes.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.688
Assume the position.

19:32.328 --> 19:34.068
Now cough twice.

19:56.548 --> 19:59.883
<i>Local principal, Jefferson Pierce
was arrested today at Garfield high.</i>

20:00.083 --> 20:03.418
<i>Sources confirmed large amounts
of controlled substances</i>

20:03.618 --> 20:04.688
<i>Were confiscated
from his vehicle.</i>

20:04.888 --> 20:05.958
I need to see Jefferson Pierce.

20:06.158 --> 20:07.293
And you are?

20:07.493 --> 20:08.628
His wife.

20:09.598 --> 20:10.658
ID.

20:15.038 --> 20:17.368
His ex-wife, actually.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.768
Then I can't help you, ma'am.

20:21.438 --> 20:24.108
Can I speak to inspector
Henderson, please?

20:25.978 --> 20:27.048
Lynn...

20:35.688 --> 20:39.588
Bill, you know Jeff.
You know he would never ever do anything-

20:39.788 --> 20:40.688
Of course I know, Lynn.

20:40.888 --> 20:43.598
But now is not the time
and this is not the place.

20:43.798 --> 20:46.198
Well... He can't be here
right now. He can't.

20:46.398 --> 20:48.168
Something so bad could happen.

20:49.298 --> 20:51.668
Where's-
Lynn, look at me.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.768
Do you trust me?

20:54.278 --> 20:55.338
No.

20:57.848 --> 20:59.508
But I know Jefferson does.

21:01.278 --> 21:03.648
And I have to go set the record for
speed-interviewing defense lawyers,

21:03.848 --> 21:05.218
So I'll talk to you later.

21:05.418 --> 21:06.488
All right.

21:33.278 --> 21:35.008
So you know.

21:35.018 --> 21:37.518
We knew the ASA was coming for us.
I didn't expect this, though.

21:37.718 --> 21:38.978
Okay. I'm suiting up
and I'm going in.

21:38.988 --> 21:40.288
No, you're not.

21:40.488 --> 21:42.788
Yeah, I am.
You can help me or not, but I'm going.

21:42.988 --> 21:45.658
Anissa, if your father wanted out this way,
he could do it himself.

21:45.858 --> 21:47.228
If you don't maintain
your secret identity,

21:47.428 --> 21:48.658
It could endanger Jennifer.

21:48.858 --> 21:49.728
Your mother, too.

21:49.928 --> 21:52.298
How does it help the ASA
to put dad in jail?

21:52.498 --> 21:55.998
The national security apparatus can
push buttons in local law enforcement.

21:56.198 --> 21:57.698
This is smoke.

21:57.708 --> 22:00.408
The fire comes when he gets
moved by an ASA collection team

22:00.608 --> 22:02.268
That's equipped
to neutralize his powers.

22:02.278 --> 22:05.038
They'll throw him in a black site and
confirm that he's Black Lightning.

22:05.948 --> 22:07.008
And then what?

22:08.148 --> 22:09.308
They'll kill him.

22:10.448 --> 22:12.748
Okay. We've got
to get him out of there.

22:12.948 --> 22:15.248
No, that will only confirm
their suspicions.

22:15.258 --> 22:17.888
What we have to do
is prove to the ASA

22:18.088 --> 22:20.428
That Jefferson Pierce
isn't Black Lightning.

22:22.098 --> 22:23.328
Okay.

22:24.128 --> 22:25.798
How do we do that?

22:44.248 --> 22:45.718
Henderson. Finally.

22:46.418 --> 22:47.918
Afternoon, Mr. Pierce.

22:53.988 --> 22:56.698
We're on tape.
There's eyes and ears everywhere.

22:57.828 --> 22:59.428
How's that? Better?

23:00.028 --> 23:01.098
Yeah.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.408
They took my clothes.

23:08.238 --> 23:10.638
They're being tested to see if they
contain any traces of green light.

23:11.678 --> 23:13.378
What? They're not
gonna find anything.

23:14.548 --> 23:16.248
You might be surprised
what they find.

23:17.618 --> 23:19.048
Now, we've known each other
a long time,

23:19.248 --> 23:20.218
So I'll shoot straight with you.

23:20.788 --> 23:21.848
Um...

23:21.858 --> 23:23.538
There's too much here to ignore.

23:23.738 --> 23:25.418
What's your connection
to this man?

23:26.158 --> 23:27.928
He called himself lala.

23:28.128 --> 23:29.698
A murderer, drug dealer.

23:29.898 --> 23:32.498
He was a student
when I was a young teacher.

23:33.428 --> 23:34.668
Nothing beyond that?

23:36.568 --> 23:38.668
Despite my efforts,
he joined the one hundred.

23:38.868 --> 23:40.568
He worked his way up the ranks.

23:41.738 --> 23:44.308
So, I took advantage
of my relationship

23:44.508 --> 23:47.078
And got him to make
Garfield high off-limits.

23:47.278 --> 23:49.378
So why did members
of the one hundred

23:49.578 --> 23:51.678
Enter Garfield
and kidnap your daughters?

23:51.688 --> 23:52.748
I don't know.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.148
Drug deal gone bad?

24:00.028 --> 24:01.628
Henderson, I'm being set up.

24:04.798 --> 24:06.528
Why would someone set you up?

24:09.438 --> 24:10.468
I don't know.

24:12.308 --> 24:14.108
Interview's over.
No. It's not.

24:14.308 --> 24:16.478
I have a transfer order
above your pay grade and mine.

24:16.678 --> 24:17.808
From who?
Hell if I know.

24:18.008 --> 24:19.478
It's a national
security directive.

24:21.678 --> 24:22.878
But I wouldn't wanna be you.

24:33.118 --> 24:36.418
Our reporter in the field,
John webb, has been on the street,

24:36.618 --> 24:38.588
Talking to people
about the shocking arrest

24:38.788 --> 24:42.658
Of nationally respected Garfield
high principal Jefferson Pierce.

24:42.858 --> 24:44.788
Every time a brother
tries to help his people,

24:44.798 --> 24:46.698
They find a way to set him up
and take him down.

24:46.898 --> 24:48.228
It's a shame.

24:48.428 --> 24:52.268
I heard he walks around and makes
the students call him black Jesus.

24:52.468 --> 24:54.568
Imagine that. Black Jesus.

24:54.768 --> 24:56.868
My niece went to Garfield.

24:56.878 --> 24:58.543
That girl never
would've graduated

24:58.743 --> 25:00.208
If it wasn't for
principal Pierce.

25:00.408 --> 25:03.108
The police know damn well Mr.
Pierce ain't no drug dealer.

25:03.118 --> 25:05.648
Any man who would do that
could do anything.

25:05.848 --> 25:08.818
He kept her focused and
helped her get into college.

25:09.018 --> 25:11.988
She graduates from Johns
Hopkins next semester.

25:12.188 --> 25:12.758
There you have it.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.858
<i>Shock, disbelief, and for some,</i>

25:15.058 --> 25:17.728
<i>Disillusionment about this
turn of events.</i>

25:17.928 --> 25:19.078
<i>John webb reporting.</i>

25:19.278 --> 25:20.428
[Ell phone vibrating]

25:24.368 --> 25:25.638
Dr. Lynn Stewart.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.808
<i>The feds
are transferring Jefferson.</i>

25:29.008 --> 25:31.668
<i>Some kind of national security thing.
Ere'nothing I can do.</i>

25:33.038 --> 25:35.908
National security?
What are the allegations?

25:37.118 --> 25:38.548
<i>I've told you
everything I know.</i>

25:40.548 --> 25:41.748
Thank you.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.788
Your mother called.

25:48.988 --> 25:50.658
The order came to move Jefferson.
We're out of time.

25:50.858 --> 25:52.198
Okay, we go with your plan.

25:52.398 --> 25:54.528
Anissa,
I want to save your dad as much as you,

25:54.728 --> 25:57.528
But you need to understand the
tech we're using is a prototype,

25:57.538 --> 26:00.698
Put together in half a day with parts
I cannibalized from the sanctum.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.338
And?

26:03.408 --> 26:04.708
It's untested.
It may not work.

26:04.908 --> 26:05.778
But it might.

26:05.978 --> 26:07.108
Look, I can't lose my dad.

26:07.308 --> 26:08.908
And at this point,
we're the only hope he's got.

26:10.348 --> 26:12.648
You have to do exactly as I tell you.
One misstep-

26:12.848 --> 26:14.648
Ain't gonna be no missteps.

26:14.848 --> 26:16.648
Just walk me through it.
I got this.

26:21.758 --> 26:24.558
I have one more lawyer to interview,
and I'll get back to you.

26:25.398 --> 26:27.328
Okay. Thank you.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.238
Why can't he just
Black Lightning his way out?

26:35.538 --> 26:38.008
You know, you're gonna
have to learn that you can't

26:38.208 --> 26:40.678
Punch or superpower your way
out of every problem.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.648
I know you're scared.
It's okay to be scared.

26:51.118 --> 26:52.418
I'm not.

26:53.928 --> 26:55.828
Dad told me
to be strong for you.

26:59.058 --> 27:01.968
It's okay to be strong
and scared at the same time.

27:03.098 --> 27:04.498
It's called having sense.

27:09.438 --> 27:11.108
Well, what if
we can't get him out?

27:12.438 --> 27:15.208
I mean, it does happen
to people all the time, right?

27:24.718 --> 27:26.658
What if daddy never comes home?

27:29.158 --> 27:30.358
He will.

27:50.218 --> 27:52.018
You two, let's go.

27:52.218 --> 27:53.848
No. Not you.

28:08.128 --> 28:11.168
Hey, man, I'm trying to help you,
but national security directives?

28:11.368 --> 28:13.738
And top secret transfer orders?
You a spy or something?

28:13.938 --> 28:15.368
What? No, I'm not.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.768
Look, Jeff, we're friends,
we don't tell each other everything.

28:17.778 --> 28:21.608
But if you know of any reason this
is going down, now is the time.

28:27.048 --> 28:28.248
I really don't know.

28:36.558 --> 28:38.498
Yeah, I'm still gonna help you.

28:38.698 --> 28:41.198
I was just hoping you would
make it a little easier for me.

29:06.188 --> 29:07.058
What do you want?

29:07.258 --> 29:08.828
Come on in. Have a seat.

29:14.898 --> 29:17.128
"Follow the money."
isn't that what they always say?

29:17.138 --> 29:19.238
Henderson, I don't have time
for whatever this is.

29:19.438 --> 29:20.668
Oh, I think you do.

29:21.708 --> 29:22.908
I called in
a lifetime of favors,

29:23.108 --> 29:25.038
But from what I could tell,

29:25.238 --> 29:26.938
You hit the lottery.

29:29.378 --> 29:30.508
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:31.878 --> 29:33.578
Your son has himself
a new house.

29:33.588 --> 29:36.188
Contractor says he paid in cash.

29:36.388 --> 29:39.118
I wonder what the IRS would
have to say about that?

29:40.758 --> 29:43.758
Now, look, I know there's a lot of
money to be made with the badge.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.698
I got you dead to rights.

29:47.528 --> 29:49.768
But the good news is,
I don't want you.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.138
I want Cayman.

29:53.968 --> 29:55.038
Now...

29:55.768 --> 29:57.208
How about you sit down?

30:11.358 --> 30:14.258
Monitoring three students
who've ingested green light.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.388
No enhanced abilities observed.

30:25.468 --> 30:26.768
Whoa!

30:28.668 --> 30:31.508
<i>Don't let anything get
between you and the hologram,</i>

30:31.708 --> 30:33.308
Or people will realize
it's not really him.

30:33.508 --> 30:34.478
Okay. I got it.

30:34.678 --> 30:35.878
I'll turn it off for now.

30:37.548 --> 30:40.078
Get as much attention as you can,
and I'll turn it back on.

30:40.788 --> 30:41.848
All right.

30:52.398 --> 30:54.658
Oh, my God. Look!
It's thunder!

30:54.668 --> 30:55.798
Look at her!

30:55.998 --> 30:57.128
Oh, my God.

31:11.148 --> 31:13.618
<i>Our reporters are on the ground
in zone four,</i>

31:13.818 --> 31:17.048
<i>Where several residents
have reported a disturbance.</i>

31:31.868 --> 31:33.268
Black Lightning!
Look, look, look!

31:33.468 --> 31:35.398
Look! It's Black Lightning
and thunder!

31:40.848 --> 31:43.248
It's a good thing Freeland's
power grid is so easy to hack.

31:53.928 --> 31:56.428
You're almost at the intersection.
There.

32:01.868 --> 32:03.898
Damn! Don't let that car
get between you.

32:04.098 --> 32:05.098
I know.

32:13.978 --> 32:14.908
Let's got,
Black Lightning, let's go!

32:24.388 --> 32:25.518
<i>It's crazy, man.</i>

32:25.718 --> 32:28.088
<i>I mean, it still bugs me
when I see Black Lightning.</i>

32:28.288 --> 32:30.988
<i>Negro running around looking like
a modern-day George Clinton.</i>

32:30.998 --> 32:34.658
But now he got that fine-ass
woman running around with him.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.798
Must be nice.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.668
<i>I'm happy to see them
both out here trying to help.</i>

32:38.868 --> 32:39.968
Since they showed up,

32:40.168 --> 32:42.438
Less of these kids out here
trippin' on that green light,

32:42.638 --> 32:43.738
That's for sure.
Yeah.

32:43.938 --> 32:44.868
For sure.

34:10.027 --> 34:12.458
Glennon admitted
to planting the evidence.

34:12.658 --> 34:13.858
You're being cleared
for release.

34:16.797 --> 34:17.967
Thanks, brother.

34:18.838 --> 34:20.098
The next few rounds are on you.

34:21.408 --> 34:23.138
I was told you were down here.

34:23.938 --> 34:24.938
What are you doing?

34:25.138 --> 34:28.378
Police work.
You should try it sometime.

34:28.578 --> 34:31.007
You just flushed your badge
down the toilet, Henderson.

34:31.018 --> 34:33.678
Mr. Pierce, once you get dressed,
you're free to go.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.688
Hey!

34:45.027 --> 34:46.757
What the hell?

34:46.768 --> 34:49.128
I'm embarrassed that it took me
this long to do the right thing,

34:50.138 --> 34:52.638
Start weeding this place
of all the rot.

34:53.808 --> 34:56.007
But once
detective glennon got going,

34:56.208 --> 34:58.508
He had an awful lot to say,
mainly about you.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.378
Don't play cop games with me.

35:01.448 --> 35:03.098
You know, who knew
you were smart enough

35:03.298 --> 35:04.748
To seek out some
shell corporations,

35:04.948 --> 35:06.918
But dumb enough to leave the
paperwork in your house?

35:08.548 --> 35:11.688
You're under arrest.
The officer will read you your rights.

35:12.718 --> 35:14.688
You're making a mistake,
Henderson.

35:14.888 --> 35:17.058
Hey. You don't know
how this town really works!

35:21.628 --> 35:23.198
Actually, I do.

35:31.508 --> 35:32.778
Daddy!

35:34.678 --> 35:35.978
I'm so happy you're home!

35:36.178 --> 35:39.718
Oh. Me, too, sweetie.
Me, too.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.218
You know what? I'm hungry.
Let's get some ice cream.

35:44.418 --> 35:47.258
Well, I guess we had our moment.
Yeah.

36:09.608 --> 36:11.108
It's Uncle Gambi.

36:18.318 --> 36:19.788
Thanks for coming over.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.458
Anissa told me what you did.

36:24.698 --> 36:27.033
Did she tell you
about the self-driving van?

36:27.233 --> 36:29.568
I'm really proud
of the self-driving van.

36:30.998 --> 36:33.698
Do you think the ASA
bought your hologram move?

36:33.708 --> 36:34.768
For now.

36:37.938 --> 36:39.308
Jefferson, I-

36:39.508 --> 36:43.908
Look, I don't know how things
are going to be, moving forward.

36:44.978 --> 36:46.618
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

36:48.488 --> 36:49.948
I might not be able to.

36:51.258 --> 36:53.758
But I still can't forget
what you've done for me.

36:55.728 --> 36:57.188
For my family.

37:02.228 --> 37:05.498
I want to find a new balance.

37:06.938 --> 37:08.268
Somehow.

37:11.908 --> 37:13.138
Okay.

37:14.678 --> 37:16.708
Just let me know
what you need from me.

37:17.878 --> 37:21.218
I need you to help me
save those children.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.758
Revelations that renowned Garfield
high principal, Jefferson Pierce

37:25.958 --> 37:29.128
Was framed by Freeland PD
deputy chief Cayman.

37:29.328 --> 37:30.888
He has been
completely exonerated,

37:30.898 --> 37:33.428
While Cayman and his cohorts
are in custody.

37:33.628 --> 37:36.828
We go live now to the
Freeland PD press conference.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.998
This is a new day in Freeland.

37:40.008 --> 37:44.708
For years, good folk have suffered
from over or under-policing,

37:44.908 --> 37:47.893
From police brutality
instead of public safety,

37:48.093 --> 37:51.078
And from corruption
rather than professionalism.

37:51.278 --> 37:53.078
I am of this community,

37:53.278 --> 37:57.048
From this community,
and devoted to this community.

37:58.158 --> 38:00.718
With the support
of the police chief,

38:00.728 --> 38:03.928
I embrace my new role
as deputy chief.

38:06.428 --> 38:08.698
And I promise
the people of Freeland

38:08.898 --> 38:10.528
A better police department.

38:13.538 --> 38:16.208
So, Gambi, you're the eldest.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.608
Lead us?

38:23.308 --> 38:28.048
We are thankful for the
companionship that warms our hearts,

38:28.248 --> 38:31.418
For the food that we're about to
eat that will nourish our bodies,

38:33.258 --> 38:36.188
And we're thankful for your eternal
protection which maintains our souls.

38:36.998 --> 38:38.128
Amen.

38:38.328 --> 38:39.258
Amen.

38:39.458 --> 38:40.558
Let's eat.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.128
Here you go.

38:44.138 --> 38:45.168
Thank you.
