WEBVTT

00:01.733 --> 00:04.387
Now kids, When aunt Robin was the teenager.

00:04.488 --> 00:07.685
She was, well, the Canadian pop star.

00:08.601 --> 00:11.436
But by 2008, she was the entirely different person.

00:16.273 --> 00:19.571
Coming up next,is your baby trying to kill you

00:20.667 --> 00:23.351
Which maybe events that week, all the more surprising.

00:23.643 --> 00:26.327
So, I got up this morning, its freezing.

00:26.338 --> 00:27.142
So I walked over there.

00:27.243 --> 00:28.761
And I don't know why I am still talking.

00:29.002 --> 00:31.204
Because clearly we are all asking the same question.

00:31.305 --> 00:33.647
What in god's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.241
I know, right, isn't that amazing.

00:36.544 --> 00:39.198
I spent half an hour making these happen

00:39.399 --> 00:41.037
Its tape in there, cotton balls,

00:41.048 --> 00:42.707
half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?

00:42.717 --> 00:44.687
Totally. What's the occasion?

00:44.698 --> 00:46.497
And old friend from Canada  is in town

00:46.508 --> 00:48.006
and I'm meeting him  for a drink.

00:48.016 --> 00:50.449
Ooh! Somebody you went   to Degrassi with?

00:50.460 --> 00:54.170
No. Actually, he was  my first boyfriend.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.795
Simon. I thought   he was the coolest guy ever.

00:58.805 --> 01:00.142
He smelled like Drakkar.

01:00.152 --> 01:02.253
He could ollie on a skateboard.

01:02.264 --> 01:04.394
He had the most amazing   collection

01:04.406 --> 01:06.608
of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts.

01:06.618 --> 01:10.499
We spent the whole summer  madly in love.

01:10.509 --> 01:12.610
Tell me more.  Tell me more.

01:12.621 --> 01:15.235
Like, did he have a car?

01:16.472 --> 01:17.799
So he's the guy who...

01:17.809 --> 01:20.352
How shall I say this   like a gentleman?

01:20.363 --> 01:23.097
Robin, did he take your maple leaf?

01:23.108 --> 01:25.812
No, it wasn't like that.

01:25.823 --> 01:29.462
Sounds to me like he gave you  your first "O, Canada!" face.

01:29.473 --> 01:32.348
NARROR:   This went on    for a really long time.

01:32.358 --> 01:34.690
Some of them jokes were elegant   and well-crafted...

01:34.701 --> 01:36.571
Wait, wait. Did he break up with you

01:36.581 --> 01:39.416
and tell you he's just not that Inuit?

01:39.427 --> 01:41.297
(laughing)

01:41.307 --> 01:42.935
NARRATOR:  ...others were crude,   and ill-formed...

01:42.946 --> 01:46.455
Um, something about fur trapping.

01:46.465 --> 01:48.767
NARRATOR:   ...and others were obvious,    but needed to be said...

01:48.778 --> 01:51.683
Did you ride his Zamboni?

01:51.694 --> 01:52.960
Oh! Come on!  Oh!

01:52.971 --> 01:54.237
(laughter)

01:54.248 --> 01:56.309
Wait, wait, wait.  Did he...?

01:56.319 --> 01:59.124
I think I'm out.

01:59.135 --> 02:02.352
Yeah, I'm also "oot."

02:03.398 --> 02:04.926
Okay, now I'm really out.

02:04.936 --> 02:07.007
Well, I'm sorry, guys.  It was all very tame.

02:07.018 --> 02:09.079
We only dated for a week and a half.

02:09.089 --> 02:11.461
Wha...? I thought you said  you were together all summer.

02:11.472 --> 02:14.609
Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty  much the last week of July.

02:14.619 --> 02:16.087
Anyway, one night,

02:16.097 --> 02:18.299
his band just finish playing  this gig...

02:18.309 --> 02:22.049
(panting)

02:22.060 --> 02:24.865
Oh, my God! Simon.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.680
That was such a good show.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.233
You guys totally rocked out.

02:30.244 --> 02:31.671
Yeah.

02:31.682 --> 02:33.009
I know.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.292
I figure we're about  four or five gigs away

02:35.302 --> 02:36.599
from really exploding.

02:36.609 --> 02:38.941
We're gonna be big, babe.

02:38.952 --> 02:41.536
I mean, like  Crash-Test-Dummies big.

02:42.612 --> 02:44.371
So, that everything?

02:44.382 --> 02:45.317
Yeah.

02:45.327 --> 02:46.935
All right.

02:48.373 --> 02:49.951
Listen, babe...

02:50.756 --> 02:52.314
It's over.

02:52.325 --> 02:54.999
What?

02:55.010 --> 02:57.724
I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.

02:58.459 --> 02:59.826
Louise Marsh?!

02:59.836 --> 03:02.671
That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.160
Yeah, why would he want to get back together  with Louise Marsh?

03:06.171 --> 03:08.543
Well, the thing is...

03:08.554 --> 03:11.962
her folks just put in a pool.

03:11.972 --> 03:13.329
Oh...  So...

03:13.340 --> 03:16.044
I totally... I get it.

03:16.055 --> 03:18.025
Pools are great.

03:18.035 --> 03:19.643
Swimming's awesome.

03:20.851 --> 03:22.680
We have a sprinkler.

03:22.691 --> 03:24.671
Run right through it.

03:25.245 --> 03:27.778
Well, I should go.

03:27.789 --> 03:29.226
Uh...

03:29.930 --> 03:32.383
Babe, wait.

03:33.319 --> 03:34.787
Yeah, Simon?

03:34.797 --> 03:37.541
You forgot to load the drum set.

03:38.346 --> 03:39.773
No!

03:39.784 --> 03:42.428
Tell me you did not load the drum set.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.796
(drums feet):  I did.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.575
(all groaning)

03:45.586 --> 03:47.054
And now he's coming here?

03:47.064 --> 03:48.893
Robin, why do you want to see this guy?

03:48.904 --> 03:51.437
Oh! I know why.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.117
You're gonna win, aren't you?

03:53.127 --> 03:55.097
I have no idea what   you' talking about.

03:55.108 --> 03:56.435
Yes, you do.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.144
Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.753
no matter how much you want to deny it,

03:59.763 --> 04:01.894
there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.

04:01.905 --> 04:02.769
Well, since you brought it up,

04:02.780 --> 04:04.750
let's add up the points.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.963
You're starting out with two big ones right there.

04:06.973 --> 04:08.430
Thank you.

04:08.441 --> 04:10.813
Okay. So, Simon still  lives with his mom.

04:10.824 --> 04:11.789
Point Robin.

04:11.799 --> 04:12.693
Um, he never became

04:12.704 --> 04:13.729
a rock star.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.368
Point Robin.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.581
He now works at a water slide  park outside of Ottawa.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.028
Point Simon.

04:19.039 --> 04:20.495
Wait. Do they have a wave pool?

04:20.507 --> 04:21.642
No.

04:21.653 --> 04:23.784
Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip.

04:23.795 --> 04:25.293
There's no coming back  from that.

04:25.303 --> 04:26.630
Yeah, he's going down.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.294
I mean, unless somehow,  he got hotter.

04:29.757 --> 04:31.928
There he is.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.975
NARRATOR:    And sure enough,   there was a clear winner,

04:34.986 --> 04:38.806
and a clear loser.

04:40.184 --> 04:42.657
NARRATOR:   It just wasn't clear  to everybody.

04:42.668 --> 04:44.296
Hey, babe.

04:44.307 --> 04:48.288
(giggling):  Oh, my God.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:01.702 --> 05:03.330
Okay, what the hell just happened?

05:03.341 --> 05:05.985
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?

05:05.995 --> 05:07.151
(others groan)

05:07.161 --> 05:08.327
Hey, Simon.

05:08.338 --> 05:11.274
Wow, look at you.

05:11.284 --> 05:13.234
You got old.

05:13.737 --> 05:14.732
ROBIN: Yeah.

05:14.743 --> 05:16.975
You look great.

05:16.985 --> 05:17.849
You got hotter,

05:17.860 --> 05:19.589
like that's possible.

05:19.599 --> 05:20.996
(giggles)

05:21.007 --> 05:22.505
So...

05:22.515 --> 05:25.993
Look, I know it didn't go  as planned,

05:26.004 --> 05:27.059
but I can't help it.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.467
I mean...

05:28.478 --> 05:29.825
he's still got it.

05:30.589 --> 05:32.931
Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?

05:32.942 --> 05:34.842
What a rip.

05:34.853 --> 05:36.622
Good think I'm packing.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.572
(giggles)

05:39.307 --> 05:41.378
So he's not a snob.

05:41.388 --> 05:42.715
He's from a different part

05:42.726 --> 05:44.153
of Canada, you know?

05:44.163 --> 05:46.505
The maple leaf flag on the back  of the pickup truck?

05:46.516 --> 05:48.516
He's Red Province.

05:48.527 --> 05:50.286
He's from the Deep North.

05:50.297 --> 05:51.563
The thing is,

05:51.574 --> 05:53.574
we gave you so many  opportunities.

05:53.585 --> 05:54.952
So, Simon,

05:54.962 --> 05:57.696
Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York.

05:57.707 --> 05:59.275
She's the lead anchor  at Metro News One.

05:59.286 --> 06:01.588
Tell him, Robin.

06:01.599 --> 06:02.855
No. It's stupid.

06:02.866 --> 06:05.249
It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.

06:05.882 --> 06:07.621
I'm sorry, Simon.

06:07.632 --> 06:10.497
Here we are nattering on   about our big celebrity.

06:10.507 --> 06:12.276
What do you do for a living?

06:12.287 --> 06:14.921
Oh, I work at the Splish Splash   Ottawa Water Slide Park.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.871
Huh! A water slide park.

06:16.882 --> 06:19.486
That sure is different than what Robin does.

06:19.496 --> 06:23.045
Yeah, it is...  because I save lives.

06:23.719 --> 06:25.317
If I'm not sitting in that stool

06:25.328 --> 06:26.956
at the top of the slide,   going...

06:26.967 --> 06:28.233
Go...

06:28.244 --> 06:30.003
Go...

06:30.014 --> 06:31.612
Go...

06:31.623 --> 06:33.231
people die.

06:34.136 --> 06:35.372
What, you think it's so easy?

06:35.383 --> 06:37.011
You try it.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.751
Um... (clears throat)... okay.

06:38.762 --> 06:40.099
Go.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.039
You didn't put your hand up;  kid just died.

06:42.050 --> 06:43.246
No, I didn't know...

06:43.256 --> 06:44.854
Another kid just went; he died too.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.433
Oh, well, sure.  I mean, if I was actually...

06:46.444 --> 06:48.173
Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up

06:48.183 --> 06:50.314
and Robin's got something  to report on the news.

06:50.325 --> 06:53.703
This just in:  My friend, Ted, just killed  a bunch of kids today.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.181
Well, that's cool.

06:55.191 --> 06:56.789
You got to pay the bills somehow

06:56.800 --> 07:00.138
since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?

07:00.148 --> 07:02.118
Well, it hasn't panned out yet,  but the band's still going.

07:02.129 --> 07:03.224
About four or five gigs

07:03.235 --> 07:05.336
away from really  exploding.

07:05.347 --> 07:07.860
The Foreskins are still playing?

07:08.695 --> 07:09.961
The Foreskins?

07:09.972 --> 07:12.676
How'd you guys come up with that name?

07:12.687 --> 07:15.954
(sighs)   Well, there's four of us,

07:15.965 --> 07:17.845
and we play without shirts.

07:18.579 --> 07:20.680
Babe, seriously.

07:20.691 --> 07:24.149
I know. I'm sorry.

07:24.853 --> 07:26.783
I know. I'm sorry.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.865
But you guys just   don't understand.

07:28.875 --> 07:32.615
The fact that he kept the band  going-- that's impressive.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.757
I mean, I gave up   my musical dream.

07:34.767 --> 07:37.944
Which brings us  to the most important piece

07:37.955 --> 07:40.458
of information from tonight.

07:40.469 --> 07:41.836
So, Simon,

07:41.846 --> 07:43.072
how did you guys meet?

07:43.083 --> 07:44.349
Oh, I was in her video.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.290
Starred in it is more like it.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.336
Well, once you win  Mr. Teen Winnipeg,

07:49.347 --> 07:52.795
everybody wants a piece  of the moneymaker.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.038
I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to the Mall"

07:55.048 --> 07:57.481
about a thousand times,  and you, sir, are not in it.

07:57.492 --> 07:58.929
No, I was   in the other one.

07:58.939 --> 07:59.542
There's another video?!

08:06.078 --> 08:07.636
Robin, seriously,

08:07.647 --> 08:09.517
just make this  easier on yourself

08:09.527 --> 08:10.824
and give us the tape.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.231
No.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.337
All right.

08:13.348 --> 08:16.756
You leave me no choice.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.938
From this moment on,

08:18.949 --> 08:23.795
I will spend every waking minute   ching down this tape.

08:23.805 --> 08:26.379
I will not sleep. I will not eat.

08:26.389 --> 08:29.294
My life will be a living hell   of search engines

08:29.305 --> 08:31.567
and overseas phone calls,

08:31.578 --> 08:35.187
chasing down something  that possibly can't be found.

08:35.197 --> 08:37.479
Okay.

08:38.315 --> 08:39.913
It's just...

08:39.923 --> 08:41.461
It was so hard to watch, Robin.

08:41.472 --> 08:43.402
You're usually so cool.

08:43.412 --> 08:45.040
I don't know  what's wrong with me.

08:45.051 --> 08:49.163
I'm sitting next to Simon,  and suddenly I'm 16 again.

08:49.174 --> 08:50.440
Oh, it's actually a common thing.

08:50.451 --> 08:51.979
When you're around someone from your past,

08:51.989 --> 08:53.286
you kind of revert back to who you were

08:53.296 --> 08:54.663
when you knew them.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.202
There's not really a name for it, though.

08:56.212 --> 08:57.680
It's called "revertigo."

08:57.690 --> 09:00.696
Yeah, I don't know about "revertigo."

09:00.707 --> 09:02.939
You know who gets   really bad revertigo?

09:02.949 --> 09:04.648
(whispers): Lily when she around

09:04.658 --> 09:07.332
her high school   friend, Michelle.

09:07.343 --> 09:09.917
Michelle? She sounds hot.

09:09.927 --> 09:12.129
You don't know about Lily and Michelle?

09:12.139 --> 09:14.974
No. What about  Lily and Michelle?

09:14.985 --> 09:17.327
Oh, my friend,  you are in for a treat.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.368
Hey, Lil? What?

09:19.379 --> 09:20.877
You know, I was  just thinking,

09:20.887 --> 09:22.716
we haven't seen your friend  Michelle in a while.

09:22.727 --> 09:25.833
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,  see if she wants to hang out.

09:25.844 --> 09:27.623
Yeah.

09:29.062 --> 09:31.434
What... (stammers)   Do they make out?

09:31.445 --> 09:32.500
Better.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.380
Comparable. Comparable.

09:34.391 --> 09:37.337
Whatever.  It's over. I lost.

09:38.242 --> 09:40.785
I guess you, uh,  you don't get second chance.

09:40.796 --> 09:42.123
I got a second chance.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.158
What happened?

09:43.169 --> 09:45.250
He came by my place tonight...

09:46.386 --> 09:48.557
Simon.   What are you doing here?

09:48.568 --> 09:50.438
I just feel like there's   some unfinished business

09:50.448 --> 09:52.157
between you and me.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.721
Seeing you now...

09:54.732 --> 09:56.903
has made me realize   that breaking up with you

09:56.914 --> 09:59.789
is the biggest mistake   I made in my entire life.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.244
Oh, I like where  this is going.

10:02.918 --> 10:04.245
I know this is crazy,

10:04.256 --> 10:06.428
and I'm only in town  for a couple of days,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.974
but do you want to go  on a date?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.311
He asked you out?!

10:10.322 --> 10:12.696
Oh, step into my web, Simon.

10:12.706 --> 10:14.033
The coup de grace.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.492
(a la Mortal Kombat):  Finish him!

10:16.529 --> 10:18.933
I'd love to!

10:25.754 --> 10:27.554
Wait. You're going  on a date with Simon?

10:27.565 --> 10:29.768
That Simon?The one we met?

10:29.778 --> 10:31.940
Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance.

10:31.951 --> 10:34.496
Not after the way  he treated you.

10:34.506 --> 10:36.336
That was ten years ago. People evolve.

10:36.347 --> 10:40.069
I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?

10:41.277 --> 10:42.443
Oh, hell, no!

10:42.454 --> 10:45.160
I think you're gonna enjoy this.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.775
That my girl Michelle?  Bitch, you know it!

10:47.785 --> 10:50.652
How she livin'?  She living only way she know how to.

10:50.662 --> 10:51.999
Large!

10:52.011 --> 10:54.817
Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.

10:54.827 --> 10:57.633
I'm hoping my t ass can  hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.

10:57.644 --> 10:59.414
For reals.

11:01.769 --> 11:04.937
I want her around   all the time.

11:04.948 --> 11:07.322
I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her

11:07.332 --> 11:09.645
if that's what it takes.

11:10.722 --> 11:13.468
Guys, I've decided  to seduce Michelle.

11:14.203 --> 11:16.406
(rock music playing)

11:16.416 --> 11:18.518
(laughs)

11:18.528 --> 11:20.197
(song ends)

11:20.208 --> 11:21.435
(Robin whoops)

11:21.446 --> 11:22.944
Yeah!   Guys, that was great.

11:22.955 --> 11:24.594
Let's take five.

11:24.605 --> 11:26.335
Hey, babe,  did you like it

11:26.345 --> 11:28.849
after my bass solo when   I flicked my pick at you?

11:28.860 --> 11:30.057
That rocked.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.736
Yeah.

11:31.747 --> 11:34.010
Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.

11:34.021 --> 11:35.459
Oh, uh, sure.

11:35.469 --> 11:37.068
Um, I think it...

11:37.079 --> 11:39.111
It's cool. You'll  find it later. Oh, cool.

11:39.121 --> 11:41.193
I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.

11:41.204 --> 11:42.602
Oh, but, babe, you  got to go to work.

11:42.612 --> 11:44.674
You got to play our  demo on your show.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.484
Oh, well, you know, it's not a show.

11:46.495 --> 11:47.893
It's the news.

11:47.903 --> 11:49.271
Right. So you   can be, like,

11:49.282 --> 11:50.750
"Hey, did you hear  there's some news?

11:50.760 --> 11:52.792
There's a rad band you  guys should check out."

11:52.803 --> 11:54.201
And then play it.

11:54.211 --> 11:56.957
Or just, like, the  first three songs.

11:58.034 --> 12:00.106
And now it's time  for "Puppy Corner,"

12:00.116 --> 12:02.822
some little angels looking for a new home,

12:02.832 --> 12:05.437
courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.681
* Murder

12:07.691 --> 12:12.388
* Climb aboard  the Murder Train *

12:13.425 --> 12:15.799
* Murder

12:15.810 --> 12:20.065
* Climb aboard  the Murder Train... *

12:21.041 --> 12:23.042
Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted.

12:23.053 --> 12:25.990
Of course, a lot of the   people calling in thought

12:26.000 --> 12:27.871
we were going   to kill them.

12:27.882 --> 12:31.151
Robin, your revertigo is really   starting to affect your work.

12:31.161 --> 12:32.901
What's revertigo?

12:32.912 --> 12:34.773
It's a stupid, made-up word   with no meaning.

12:34.783 --> 12:36.422
No. It's a   phenomenon where,

12:36.433 --> 12:38.364
when you're around  people from your past,

12:38.374 --> 12:40.375
you start behaving  like them.

12:40.386 --> 12:43.192
Oh. One example of that springs to mind.

12:43.203 --> 12:45.818
I think we all know what it is.

12:46.593 --> 12:47.890
You do?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.601
Yeah. Ted.

12:49.611 --> 12:50.908
Me?

12:50.919 --> 12:52.619
Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town,

12:52.629 --> 12:55.264
it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.673
TED: Okay, okay.

12:56.683 --> 12:59.016
First of all,  his name is Adam Punciarello,

12:59.027 --> 13:00.767
and I don't do that.

13:00.778 --> 13:02.035
(both scoffing)

13:02.045 --> 13:03.483
(knocking, classical music plays)

13:03.494 --> 13:05.636
Ooh. That must be Adam.

13:09.087 --> 13:10.485
'Sup, Punchy?  'Sup, Shmosby?!

13:10.495 --> 13:12.094
You want to go?  I'm alrey there!

13:12.105 --> 13:13.513
Come on!  This is it!

13:14.590 --> 13:17.195
Dude, seriously,   I'm sorry about your dad.

13:17.205 --> 13:19.086
Yeah, it was   a real shock.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.929
I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.

13:22.940 --> 13:23.905
Why?

13:23.915 --> 13:25.977
No reason.

13:25.988 --> 13:28.191
Robin, the point is,  what are you doing?

13:28.201 --> 13:30.776
I mean, this guy?

13:30.786 --> 13:32.486
Okay, you want the truth?

13:32.496 --> 13:34.568
Yeah. I like Simon.

13:34.579 --> 13:36.077
I do.

13:36.088 --> 13:37.586
We have fun together.

13:37.597 --> 13:40.363
Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.

13:40.373 --> 13:41.539
You're worried?

13:41.550 --> 13:42.847
Okay, hold on.

13:42.858 --> 13:44.658
Is there any version  of this conversation

13:44.669 --> 13:46.902
where you guys don't sound   like my parents?

13:46.912 --> 13:48.883
I don't know. Is there any version

13:48.894 --> 13:50.966
where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?

13:50.977 --> 13:54.045
That's exactly what   my mom would say.

13:54.055 --> 13:56.429
No. If I was your mom, I woulsay,

13:56.439 --> 13:58.471
"We forbid you from seeing this boy."

13:58.481 --> 13:59.718
(scoffs)  Lily!

13:59.729 --> 14:01.831
No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.038
(teary):   This is my life!

14:03.048 --> 14:04.577
You guys just don't get it!

14:04.588 --> 14:06.388
You've never felt the way  that I feel!

14:06.398 --> 14:08.933
Now, now. We were once  young and in love, too.

14:08.944 --> 14:12.092
Yeah, like, a  billion years ago.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.767
You've been drinking, haven't you?

14:14.778 --> 14:15.944
Yeah, we all have.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.121
You bought the  last round.

14:17.132 --> 14:19.636
You're not going to that show tonight!

14:19.647 --> 14:21.477
Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else?

14:21.488 --> 14:23.017
Tonight, after the show,

14:23.028 --> 14:24.667
Simon and I are going  all the way!

14:24.677 --> 14:25.833
(all gasping)

14:25.844 --> 14:27.513
Young lady, get back here!

14:27.524 --> 14:29.837
(teary): Thanks for your help.

14:30.945 --> 14:32.645
Hey, so, today at work...

14:32.655 --> 14:35.602
Not now, Ted!

14:37.353 --> 14:39.415
Geez.

14:39.425 --> 14:40.762
Ooh!

14:40.773 --> 14:42.201
Oh, hey, Simon.

14:42.212 --> 14:43.479
Great show.

14:43.489 --> 14:45.148
You guys still rock.

14:45.159 --> 14:46.657
Yeah.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.569
They totally dug my bass solo.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.330
Man!

14:51.698 --> 14:53.901
Why can't I always   feel this alive?!

14:53.911 --> 14:58.226
God, I just love  seeing you so happy.

14:58.237 --> 14:59.534
Yeah. (laughs)

14:59.545 --> 15:00.812
About that.

15:00.823 --> 15:02.563
Listen, babe.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.872
It's over. What?

15:05.883 --> 15:08.126
I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.

15:08.136 --> 15:10.137
(laughing):  What?

15:10.148 --> 15:11.787
You're kidding me.

15:12.764 --> 15:14.604
You're breaking up with me?

15:15.239 --> 15:16.637
Again?

15:16.647 --> 15:18.045
F-For the same ex-girlfriend?

15:18.055 --> 15:19.252
In the same van?

15:19.262 --> 15:20.298
What is it?

15:20.309 --> 15:21.566
Her-Her parents got a pool?

15:21.576 --> 15:23.145
Is that still the reason?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.741
Well...

15:32.240 --> 15:33.437
I'm sorry, Robin.

15:33.447 --> 15:34.644
I'm fine, really.

15:34.654 --> 15:36.756
Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real.

15:36.767 --> 15:38.135
Simon's a dawg.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.472
You feel me, Chelle?

15:39.483 --> 15:41.082
Mm-hmm, for reals.

15:41.093 --> 15:42.692
He a scrub.

15:42.702 --> 15:44.070
Mm. True dat.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.967
I'ma get me my champagne  and grape soda on.

15:47.702 --> 15:50.206
So, how's Columbia?

15:50.217 --> 15:51.484
Great!

15:51.494 --> 15:53.294
I'm almost done  with my disstation.

15:53.305 --> 15:56.373
Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in  behavioral psychology.

15:56.384 --> 15:58.255
Um, can I make an observation?

15:58.265 --> 15:59.592
Oh.

15:59.603 --> 16:00.800
I know.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.248
Whenever I'm around Lily,

16:02.259 --> 16:04.089
she just brings out   that side of me.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.930
There's a psychological term  for the phenomenon.

16:05.941 --> 16:07.812
Revertigo? No.

16:07.822 --> 16:09.622
Actually, it's associative  regression. You see,

16:09.633 --> 16:10.830
the neural pathways that...

16:10.840 --> 16:12.741
*

16:12.751 --> 16:14.682
Oh, no, you did not just

16:14.693 --> 16:16.896
put on my jam!

16:16.906 --> 16:18.777
Oh. Put your hands up, girl!

16:18.787 --> 16:21.030
Holla! Holla!

16:22.378 --> 16:25.224
NARRATOR:   One by one,  we all had to go home.

16:27.066 --> 16:29.550
Soon, it was just Robin.

16:36.825 --> 16:38.826
BARNEY: All right.

16:38.836 --> 16:40.375
I can't find your video.

16:40.386 --> 16:43.051
I've wasted three days tr...

16:43.062 --> 16:44.399
*

16:44.410 --> 16:46.411
What's the matter?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.283
*

16:48.293 --> 16:51.270
Uh... Simon dumped me

16:51.281 --> 16:53.956
in his van after the show.

16:53.967 --> 16:57.135
Yeah, Robin, that was,  like, ten years ago.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.916
No, tonight.

16:58.926 --> 17:00.022
Ooh.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.159
(laughing): Really?

17:01.170 --> 17:06.359
Oh! Oh, come here.

17:06.371 --> 17:07.739
(sobbing) Come here.

17:07.749 --> 17:11.189
*

17:11.199 --> 17:12.465
It's just...

17:12.477 --> 17:16.219
when I was young,  I was so...

17:16.229 --> 17:19.165
vulnerable and-and open to things, you know?

17:19.176 --> 17:25.746
And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again.

17:25.756 --> 17:27.887
I wanted to be 16 again.

17:27.898 --> 17:30.906
Robin, that is the stupidest thing

17:30.917 --> 17:33.492
I've ever heard come out of your mouth.

17:33.502 --> 17:36.469
You want to be 16 again?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.280
I have watched your first

17:38.291 --> 17:40.463
Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times,

17:40.474 --> 17:43.310
and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend.

17:43.321 --> 17:46.932
It's because you were totally, totally lame back then.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.943
But now, come on. Pa-cow!

17:48.954 --> 17:52.464
You're the most awesome person I have ever known.

17:52.475 --> 17:54.517
Well, second most awesome.

17:54.527 --> 17:56.327
Right. Of course, the-the first being you.

17:56.338 --> 17:57.736
No.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.507
No. The first is this guy

17:59.517 --> 18:01.820
who lives in a place called the mirror.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.772
(laughs) What up.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.210
Oh.

18:05.221 --> 18:06.619
I'm saying

18:06.629 --> 18:10.743
that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.

18:10.754 --> 18:14.335
*

18:14.345 --> 18:17.513
Barney, do you want to  come back to my place?

18:17.524 --> 18:19.193
Your place?

18:19.204 --> 18:24.968
*

18:27.826 --> 18:30.029
Are you sure you want to do this?

18:30.039 --> 18:32.141
Yeah. I am.

18:32.151 --> 18:34.686
Let's just not tell anyone   about this, okay?

18:34.697 --> 18:36.034
Of course.

18:38.590 --> 18:40.793
So, should I just put it in?

18:40.803 --> 18:42.845
Yeah, why not?

18:49.414 --> 18:51.727
(sighs)

18:53.639 --> 18:56.546
(instrumental intro  to pop ballad plays)

18:56.557 --> 19:00.872
* Met you at the mall...

19:00.883 --> 19:03.528
This was my big artistic follow-up

19:03.538 --> 19:05.368
to"Let's Go to the Mall."

19:05.379 --> 19:08.457
It kind of tanked.

19:08.468 --> 19:12.411
* My friends said I was a fool

19:12.421 --> 19:13.819
You're a fool.    Shut up!

19:13.830 --> 19:16.002
Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm.

19:16.013 --> 19:19.121
* 'Cause you were older and got kicked out of school *

19:19.131 --> 19:20.790
You are so rad.

19:20.801 --> 19:26.162
* Together we we gonna  travel the globe *

19:26.173 --> 19:31.625
* From Alberta to Ontario

19:31.636 --> 19:34.010
It's everything   I want it to be and more.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.951
Oh, I'm so glad.  Mm-hmm.

19:35.962 --> 19:38.567
* And now I'm building   sandcastles in the sand *

19:38.577 --> 19:41.856
* Sandcastles in the sand *

19:41.867 --> 19:44.834
* Thought I could fly when you held my hand *

19:44.845 --> 19:47.048
* Thought I could fly *

19:47.058 --> 19:48.697
But now...

19:48.708 --> 19:52.450
* Eternity returns to black and white... *

19:52.460 --> 19:54.190
Is that Alan Thicke?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.900
Yeah.

19:55.910 --> 19:58.555
* It was the greatest   week and a half *

19:58.566 --> 20:00.728
* Of my life

20:00.739 --> 20:03.646
* We used to go to the beach

20:03.657 --> 20:05.357
You know, if  you reedit it,

20:05.367 --> 20:08.344
there's a tampon commercial  in here somewhere.

20:08.355 --> 20:12.841
* On our favorite bench

20:12.851 --> 20:19.812
* We'd sit and talk  and you taught me to french *

20:19.823 --> 20:21.523
* You're good at...

20:21.533 --> 20:23.937
Do you seem how lame  you were back then?

20:23.947 --> 20:25.979
Yeah, you're right. I was lame.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.830
Totally lame. Ugh.

20:27.841 --> 20:29.098
* ...so unfair...

20:29.108 --> 20:32.286
ROBOT: You don't understand about love.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.701
And, of course, the robot  makes an appearance

20:34.712 --> 20:36.512
in the sad love ballad.

20:36.522 --> 20:39.026
He was my sidekick. He had to be.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.435
NARRATOR:  And so they watched it again.

20:40.446 --> 20:43.423
* Come back, please

20:43.434 --> 20:46.401
* I've changed my mind

20:46.411 --> 20:50.324
* Let's go all the way

20:50.335 --> 20:51.270
I love you.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.392
Let's do it.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.211
I miss you.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.519
NARRATOR:   And again.

20:59.529 --> 21:02.396
* Sandcastles may be cute

21:02.407 --> 21:03.775
I'm on the pill now.

21:03.785 --> 21:05.414
NARRATOR:   And again.

21:05.425 --> 21:08.905
* But now all they do   is remind me of you... *

21:08.915 --> 21:11.289
They watched it over and over   that night until finally,

21:11.300 --> 21:13.543
they stopped watching.

21:14.305 --> 21:20.559
