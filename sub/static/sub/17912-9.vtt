WEBVTT

01:00.461 --> 01:03.131
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.599
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:14.041 --> 01:19.147
Danke. Danke und willkommen
in der Grosse Tour

01:19.147 --> 01:20.981
which this week
comes from Germany!

01:21.048 --> 01:26.019
- Ja. We're here. We're here.

01:26.154 --> 01:31.159
Specifically...
Specifically, we are
in the city of Stuttgart.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.461
Except we nearly weren't.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.564
Because one of your
local Green politicians

01:36.630 --> 01:38.832
tried to ban us
from coming here.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.469
I don't want to embarrass
the poor man on television.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.837
So I've hidden his identity.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.277
Yeah.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.044
- Yeah.
- That's good.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.448
That's appropriate.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.185
I certainly don't want to
tell you his name.

01:57.185 --> 02:00.621
Which is... Andreas Kasdorf.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.258
- Uh...

02:04.325 --> 02:06.727
Not a popular man.
But you elected him.

02:06.794 --> 02:10.198
Anyway, he says that
we'd be unwelcome here

02:10.264 --> 02:13.834
because this is a very
bicycle-friendly place.

02:13.901 --> 02:18.472
It... It isn't. It's the home
of Mercedes and Porsche.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.342
- And Germany--
- Exactly.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.512
Germany...

02:25.813 --> 02:28.649
Germany is the cradle
of the automobile.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.818
The car was
actually invented here.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.554
It's the last place on Earth
you can drive a car

02:33.621 --> 02:36.790
as fast as it will go
on the motorway.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.527
- It's true.
- All true.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.630
This is a true fact.
This is a true fact.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.233
The Germans are
the only people on Earth

02:45.233 --> 02:48.369
who really know
how to make a car.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.103
- This is--

02:50.238 --> 02:53.241
- It's a true fact.
- It's true.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.442
I'll tell you a story.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.244
There was a Mercedes engineer

02:56.244 --> 02:58.912
and a Jaguar engineer
having dinner one night.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.315
The Mercedes engineer
said, "Ve haf..."

03:01.382 --> 03:02.716
Forgive the accent.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.953
"Ve haf a quality test
at ze Mercedes factory.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.557
Every night, ve take a car
off ze line at random.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.726
Ve put a cat in it,
close ze doors.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.296
If... When ve come back
in ze morning,

03:15.363 --> 03:17.965
ve know the door seals
are vorking correctly

03:18.031 --> 03:20.067
if ze cat has suffocated."

03:22.570 --> 03:25.005
- Nah.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.774
The Jaguar engineer said,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.643
"We've got something very
similar at our factory.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.545
We take a car
off the line at random.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.914
We put a cat in it.
We close the door.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.883
And we know the car's
been built properly

03:35.949 --> 03:39.019
if, when we come back
in the morning,
the cat hasn't escaped.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.855
- That is...

03:41.922 --> 03:45.025
- True story.
- Yeah. True story.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.560
The strange thing is,

03:46.627 --> 03:48.729
it isn't just cars
that are built well here.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.932
- It's absolutely everything.
- Except wine.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.967
Yes, except wine. Sorry.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.336
- Well, come on!

03:55.403 --> 03:58.306
- Now come on!

03:59.540 --> 04:01.309
I wouldn't
wash my hair in it.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.111
It is literally everything,
though.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.479
German soft toys,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.448
better than anybody
else's soft toys.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.883
Cameras, kitchen appliances.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.520
The Queen of England,
she's German.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.555
She is. That's why
she's still working

04:14.622 --> 04:17.758
even though she's a hundred
and forty seventeen years old.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.461
There is no word here
for "that'll do".

04:20.528 --> 04:23.931
There is no ambiguity
at all in Germany.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.799
You certainly see this
with films.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.569
The names you have
for American films.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.171
I've got some here.
Remember Airplane?

04:31.238 --> 04:33.106
Airplane, yes.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.675
In Germany, it was called

04:34.742 --> 04:38.512
The Unbelievable Journey
In The Crazy Airplane.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.714
That is a comprehensive title.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.115
You know where
you are with that.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.951
What was Jaws?

04:44.017 --> 04:46.987
The Weisse...?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
The White Shark.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.424
It should have been
The Massive Shark

04:50.491 --> 04:53.361
That Explodes Eventually.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.496
You know where
you're going with that.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.898
What was...
What was Basic Instinct?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.600
- Just not

04:59.667 --> 05:02.703
A Brief Glimpse Of
Sharon Stone's Vagina?

05:02.770 --> 05:05.238
- Shall we get on
with the show?
- Yes, good idea.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.475
Because in tonight's
car programme...

05:09.009 --> 05:11.479
Richard walks a dog.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.015
James hangs around a gym.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.951
And I say "Good shot."

05:18.018 --> 05:20.554
Good shot.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.122
But before all that,
I'd like to talk

05:22.189 --> 05:24.792
about the original Honda NSX.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.494
We have a picture of it here.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.729
When that car
was launched in 1990,

05:28.796 --> 05:30.531
it was considered remarkable

05:30.598 --> 05:33.567
because it was fast
and exciting like a Ferrari,

05:33.634 --> 05:35.703
but unlike a Ferrari
of the time,

05:35.769 --> 05:38.171
it was also
incredibly reliable

05:38.238 --> 05:40.441
and very, very easy to drive.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.676
Honda killed that car off
12 years ago.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.546
But finally, they've come up
with a replacement.

05:45.613 --> 05:49.417
So I've been down to our
track to see what it's like.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.086
This is it.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.025
It costs Â£138,000.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.430
Around the same
as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.465
And it has
the futuristic lines

06:04.532 --> 06:08.802
you would expect
of a rare-breed Honda.

06:08.869 --> 06:13.674
Power comes from
a 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.778
Backed up by a squadron
of electric motors.

06:17.845 --> 06:24.184
Together, they give
the NSX 573 horsepower.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.319
So you would assume
the performance

06:26.454 --> 06:29.957
is something to shout about.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.492
Now, if you ask Honda

06:31.559 --> 06:33.461
for the technical
information on this car,

06:33.527 --> 06:36.464
they will email you
a file so enormous

06:36.497 --> 06:38.198
that it actually
breaks the internet.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.802
And yet, nowhere in it does
it mention the 0-60 time.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.572
They simply refuse
to tell us what it is.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.875
I know 0-60 times are
irrelevant in the real world

06:47.941 --> 06:50.711
and they're rather childish,
but look, this is a supercar.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.013
It's top trumps, isn't it?
It's important.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.349
So I'm gonna find out what
it is for you using this.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.852
It is a data-o-logger.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.825
Right. Put it in Track mode.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.494
Here we go. Launch control.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.396
Foot on the brake.
Mash the pedal.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.006
Phwoarh!

07:22.743 --> 07:24.512
I'm not sure that was
quite as neck-snapping

07:24.545 --> 07:25.679
as a Nissan GTR,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.781
but it wasn't far off.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.050
Let's see what I did.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.288
3.2 seconds 0-60.

07:35.355 --> 07:41.529
Which means it isn't quite
as fast as a McLaren 570S,

07:41.529 --> 07:44.532
or a 911 Turbo S,

07:44.565 --> 07:46.867
or a Ferrari 488 GTB.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.769
That's why they're
not mentioning it.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.806
Honda is happy
to quote the top speed.

07:52.873 --> 07:57.578
Which is 191 miles an hour.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.146
But that too is slower
than its rivals

07:59.212 --> 08:02.149
from Ferrari, Porsche,
and McLaren.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.956
So has the new NSX
got anything

08:09.022 --> 08:10.724
in the performance department

08:10.791 --> 08:14.061
that makes it rise above
its supercar peers?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.998
Well, yes, actually.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.801
Firstly,
there are the brakes,
which are fly-by-wire.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.003
There is no physical
connection to the pedal.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
That's because they
have to harvest energy

08:25.105 --> 08:27.474
to recharge
the battery system.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.976
It's a much cleverer
version of that

08:29.042 --> 08:30.911
than you get
on the Porsche 918,

08:30.978 --> 08:33.581
a car that costs
five times as much.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.015
Then there's
the hybrid system.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.750
It uses not one
electric motor,

08:36.817 --> 08:38.919
as you might expect,
but three.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.856
And the way it uses them
is well good.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.161
The one at the back

08:48.228 --> 08:49.997
is the wingman
for the petrol engine,

08:50.063 --> 08:53.601
filling the power gaps
when the turbos lag.

08:53.667 --> 08:58.606
This gives the NSX ballistic
pick-up at any speed.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.311
Look, instant shove.
It's lovely.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.622
But it's the two at the front
that are the real party-piece

09:14.655 --> 09:16.624
because they drive a wheel

09:16.690 --> 09:19.226
each totally independently
of each other.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.261
Which means this car has

09:21.328 --> 09:25.098
a sort of space-age
four-wheel drive.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.135
And that means
extraordinary things happen

09:28.201 --> 09:30.337
when you throw it
into a corner.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.146
So, as you approach
a corner like this one,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.081
computers are
measuring the speed,

09:41.148 --> 09:44.652
they're measuring G-force,
steering input, and so forth.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.253
They're adding power
to the wheel

09:46.319 --> 09:48.889
or taking power away from
the wheel as it's needed.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.661
Then you get perfectly flat,
perfectly controlled corners.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.831
It is a bit like
driving a Honda Civic!

09:59.700 --> 10:00.934
There are people
who would say

10:01.001 --> 10:03.270
that technology
like this in a car,

10:03.336 --> 10:06.006
helping it feel secure,
will make it dull.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.641
But it doesn't
feel dull to me.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.242
It feels tremendous.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.881
I'm going fast
and I'm relaxing.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.749
What's wrong with that?

10:18.185 --> 10:20.620
But the futuristic
four-wheel drive

10:20.688 --> 10:23.590
isn't the only piece of
23rd-century engineering

10:23.657 --> 10:25.292
on the NSX.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.829
The aerodynamics,
for example, are so clever,

10:28.896 --> 10:30.563
they can cool all the motors

10:30.630 --> 10:34.134
while providing vast amounts
of grip-enhancing downforce

10:34.201 --> 10:38.906
to the front and rear wheels.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.074
And it does all this
without anything

10:41.141 --> 10:45.012
as old-fashioned
as huge wings and spoilers.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.993
It's not just the technology,
which is brilliant,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.796
it's that that technology
is on this car.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.765
Yes, we have
hybrid supercars.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.134
We have the LaFerrari,
the McLaren P1,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.601
the Porsche 918.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.403
But they're in the
million-pound bracket.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.341
This is only an eighth
of the price of the LaFerrari,

11:14.407 --> 11:16.409
and it's actually cleverer.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.312
- I love this.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.115
I love the way it looks.
I love the sounds it makes.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.918
I like the sophistication
of the hybrid drive.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.419
I like the performance.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.322
I like the steering.
I like the interior.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.824
I really, really like it.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.360
And I find myself
wanting one quite badly.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.000
The original NSX made
owning a supercar

11:40.067 --> 11:42.569
less painful
and less expensive.

11:42.635 --> 11:48.241
This has done the same
for the hybrid supercar.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.411
It really is
a worthy successor.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.393
James, Honda...

12:06.459 --> 12:10.263
Honda took ten years
to develop that car.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.231
And?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.400
Ten years is an enormous
amount of time

12:13.466 --> 12:14.534
to do a car.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.003
You can't criticise something

12:16.069 --> 12:18.105
because people spent
too long on it.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.074
People aren't gonna say
"I'm not gonna look round
Cologne cathedral.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.443
They took 600 years
to build it!"

12:23.510 --> 12:25.212
Ooh.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.414
Anyway, I love it.
I love that car.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.916
Anyway, look, we've heard

12:28.982 --> 12:30.683
what you've got to say
about the NSX.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.485
Now it's time to hand it over

12:32.552 --> 12:34.154
to a man who thinks that...

12:34.221 --> 12:37.057
Well, potted plants
are a Communist plot.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.927
Yep. Here he comes.
It's the American!

12:43.396 --> 12:48.501
Come to England.
Shit weather. Shit beer.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.570
JEREMY: And he's off!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.973
Clearly in a tremendous mood.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.608
But it is very wet out there.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.310
Wipers flapping away

12:57.377 --> 13:00.313
as he powers onto
the Isn't Straight.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.681
Looking good.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.983
Where I come from,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.118
this thing's badge
is inaccurate.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.220
Kind of like
a loser's Cadillac.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.189
And yet, strangely,
we're still waiting

13:09.256 --> 13:11.959
for Cadillac's
hybrid supercar.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.461
Right, now,
flying into Your Name Here,

13:14.527 --> 13:17.364
this really is a good day
to have four-wheel drive.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.499
I'm sure even the American
can appreciate

13:19.566 --> 13:22.202
the Honda's
hi-tech features.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.872
What is this
Space Invaders shit?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.439
JEREMY: Clearly not.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.742
Right, full power
for the Isn't again.

13:29.877 --> 13:33.313
Electric ain't for engines.
It's for lights and chairs.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.183
JEREMY: He is not
a modern man, is he?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.618
Right, carving through
the standing water.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.587
Into Old Lady's House.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.355
Slithering about a bit.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.893
Now he's leaning on it
for the Unsettled section.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.795
Past the hangars
and up to Sub Station.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.964
Hard on those wi-fi brakes

13:51.031 --> 13:52.933
for the second-to-last corner.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.102
How's he gonna manage
through here?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.070
Yes, stepping out a bit
under power.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.738
Through Field Of Sheep,

13:58.805 --> 14:01.308
keeping it tidy through
there, and across the line!

14:10.817 --> 14:12.785
Right,

14:12.920 --> 14:17.524
let's see now where the NSX
goes on our lap board.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.192
Let's have a look.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.997
- Oh.
- Oh, dear, James.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.270
James.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.307
Why didn't you tell us
it was very slow?

14:34.374 --> 14:38.278
- It's streaming wet!
- So hang on a minute.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.281
We've had a review from
a tortoise and a wet lap.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.117
Which means we've
learnt precisely nothing.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.954
Um... Yeah, you're right.
Nothing at all.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.989
- Nothing at all.
- So let's move on.

14:49.056 --> 14:53.260
Yes, let's do that by
popping some loose change
in the ticket machine

14:53.326 --> 14:56.729
so we can park awhile
on Conversation Street.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.974
OK, now...

15:06.974 --> 15:08.976
- I've got some conversation.
- Good.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.980
Last night at midnight,
there was alarm in Stuttgart.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.515
The Green Party
that runs the city

15:15.582 --> 15:20.187
asked everyone here not to
use wood-burning stoves

15:20.253 --> 15:22.990
and not to drive
their car today.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.558
- Because of the smog.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.365
Am I making this up?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.401
- There it is.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.507
I can't...

15:40.573 --> 15:42.909
I can't imagine
anything clearer.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.911
That is... That is gin-clear,

15:45.012 --> 15:46.246
but according to
the Green Party...

15:46.313 --> 15:47.847
I'm not making this up.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.049
You're all
from Stuttgart, yes?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.483
There is an alarm today

15:50.550 --> 15:53.320
- because of the smog.
- Yes.

15:55.155 --> 15:59.159
How clear is it
on a good day?

15:59.226 --> 16:02.762
- We've got a photograph here
of Beijing on now.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.564
Let us compare and contrast

16:04.631 --> 16:08.135
Beijing on a smoggy day
with Stuttgart on a...

16:08.201 --> 16:09.869
- Not the same.
- ...a smoggy day.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.405
Can I just ask,
what would you have done

16:12.472 --> 16:15.042
if they'd have
actually ordered you
not to drive cars?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.543
At the moment,
it's an advisory.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.311
If they said you are
banned from driving cars,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.513
what would you have done?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.150
Come on the train?
That's unbelievable.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.651
But this is the thing

16:24.717 --> 16:26.419
that we don't really
understand about Germany.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.056
Once something becomes
a rule, it is a rule.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.823
I once had a very
interesting conversation

16:30.890 --> 16:32.192
with two friends of mine.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.827
One is from California
and one is from Germany.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.530
We were talking about
losing your driving licence.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.667
The Californian said, "In
Germany, what would happen

16:40.733 --> 16:43.536
if you lost your licence
and then you drove your car?"

16:43.603 --> 16:45.738
The German said,
"No, you cannot do this."

16:47.440 --> 16:49.642
He says, "I know
you're not supposed to,

16:49.709 --> 16:51.244
but what if you did?"

16:51.311 --> 16:54.081
He said, "No. You cannot
drive. You have no licence."

16:55.482 --> 16:57.150
The Californian
went, "Yeah, man,

16:57.217 --> 16:58.718
"but late one night,
you just...

16:58.785 --> 17:00.220
hell, you go for a drive."

17:00.287 --> 17:01.854
The German went,
"It is impossible

17:01.921 --> 17:03.590
to drive without a licence!"

17:03.656 --> 17:06.093
- Impossible!
- Impossible.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.566
There's an interesting thing
I discovered here.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.304
On a motorway,
obviously you can drive
as fast as you like.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.971
You get people
sometimes, not often,

17:19.106 --> 17:20.807
cos your lane discipline
is unbelievable,

17:20.873 --> 17:24.477
but sometimes they sit in the
outside lane just dawdling.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.248
If you tailgate them... OK?
I've got the fines here.

17:28.315 --> 17:32.119
You get a 400 euro fine,
two penalty points,

17:32.152 --> 17:34.921
and a three-month ban
for tailgating.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.989
- That is extreme. Ouch!
- Yes.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.525
But if you overtake them
on the inside,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.360
just go past them
on the inside,

17:40.427 --> 17:43.130
that's a 150 euro fine,
and one point.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.464
Well, there you go.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.134
No. This is where
it gets really good.

17:47.134 --> 17:51.238
If you go on the hard
shoulder to overtake,
the emergency lane,

17:51.304 --> 17:55.608
that's also one point
but only a 90 euro fine.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.145
There's your answer.
That's what you do!

17:58.978 --> 18:00.713
No, no.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.519
No, because... Aha.
You may think that.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.988
But if you fit your car
with blue lights,

18:09.055 --> 18:10.623
flashing blue lights,
basically,

18:10.690 --> 18:12.592
you turn you car
into a police car,

18:12.659 --> 18:15.562
you get... I've got
the point fines here.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.565
20 euro fine
and no points at all!

18:18.631 --> 18:22.502
You're joking!

18:22.569 --> 18:26.639
- No, you don't understand.
- That is true.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.176
That is very strange
to our ears.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.978
Cos if you tried that
at home in the UK,

18:32.044 --> 18:34.614
you would be charged
with impersonating
a police officer,

18:34.681 --> 18:38.185
and you would never
get out of prison, ever.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.353
People say Germans have
no sense of humour.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.522
If you want to know
what no sense of humour is,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.624
impersonate a policeman
in Britain.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.793
Then you'll know
what no sense of humour is.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.897
Right, that is the end
of Conversation Strasse.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.770
We all like the idea of
a sports utility vehicle.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.707
A car that can handle
the Australian outback
at the weekend

19:00.773 --> 19:05.011
and then set a new
lap record at Hockenheim
on a Monday morning.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.214
But even the German
car-makers

19:07.247 --> 19:09.849
can't seem to make
the concept work.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.951
We've got this from Audi.
The RS Q3.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.420
Which is a dismal car.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.389
BMW have the X4,
I think that's called.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.824
Don't want
one of those, either.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.960
Mercedes have
this horrible monster.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.629
They're all just rubbish.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.232
And let me guess.
You have a solution.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.699
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, God.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.368
Yes, I do. A car

19:28.435 --> 19:31.804
that is both sporty
and utilitarian.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.240
This will be good.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.742
Ye of little faith.
Watch this.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.614
JEREMY: This is
a Land Rover Discovery

19:41.681 --> 19:43.650
doing utilitarian things

19:43.716 --> 19:46.253
in Britain's
muddy underbelly.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.491
And obviously
a machine like this

19:51.558 --> 19:56.263
cannot possibly be
converted into a sports car.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.433
Or can it?

20:02.669 --> 20:06.506
First of all, we have to remove
this rather ungainly body.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.608
You can't do that
with a modern car

20:08.675 --> 20:11.911
because the body is the
chassis. It's the skeleton.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.481
If you take it away,
you're left with nothing more

20:14.547 --> 20:16.583
than a collection
of unjoined-up parts.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.051
However, you can
remove the body

20:19.118 --> 20:20.387
on an old Discovery
like this,

20:20.453 --> 20:23.790
using nothing more
than one of these.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.399
After just 40 minutes

20:32.465 --> 20:34.501
with no help
from anyone else,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.337
I ended up with this.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.313
Obviously
it's still utilitarian.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.448
It will still wade
through rivers

20:48.515 --> 20:51.418
and crawl its way
up muddy banks.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.453
But now there's a...

20:53.520 --> 20:55.588
a sporty flavour as well.

20:57.156 --> 21:02.562
Without the heavy body, it
feels nimble, agile, light.

21:06.032 --> 21:10.637
If it weren't for the fact
that the windscreen is now
very close to my face,

21:10.703 --> 21:13.773
it would feel like
a Lamborghini Gallardo.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.678
The only real problem
with this

21:18.745 --> 21:20.847
is that Britain
is a police state,

21:20.913 --> 21:23.450
and if I took this
on a public road,

21:23.516 --> 21:25.685
I'd be stopped immediately

21:25.752 --> 21:27.820
by the constabulary
who would point out

21:27.887 --> 21:29.889
that I was
contravening about...

21:29.956 --> 21:33.526
4,870 different laws.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.366
It's not warm, either.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.902
Oh, no, that's stupid!

21:42.969 --> 21:44.971
Happily, both these
problems would be solved

21:45.037 --> 21:48.808
when I fitted it with
the body from a sports car.

21:51.243 --> 21:56.082
And this is the sports car
I've gone for.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.852
A 1978 MGB.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.258
Highly-trained men
are now removing its skin

22:06.393 --> 22:08.461
which will then be mated

22:08.528 --> 22:10.897
in a delicate two-hour
operation...

22:12.799 --> 22:14.967
...to the internal organs

22:15.034 --> 22:17.036
of the mud-plugging V8.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.540
The following morning

22:20.607 --> 22:22.975
my incredible car was ready.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.122
It is incredible

22:36.188 --> 22:39.959
that in a shed I have created
something which has...

22:40.026 --> 22:44.897
eluded the combined might
of the motor industry.

22:44.964 --> 22:49.436
It is a proper
sports utility vehicle.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.137
I call it the MGD,

22:51.203 --> 22:53.440
and now I'm going to find out

22:53.506 --> 22:55.842
how well it works on a road.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.722
This is...magnificent.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.794
And it is quick. Oh, yeah.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.699
To demonstrate
just how quick,

23:19.766 --> 23:21.468
I'm going to do a drag race

23:21.501 --> 23:23.470
against the motor
industry's idea

23:23.503 --> 23:24.971
of an SUV.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.180
Little bit of play there.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.152
Let's do this.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.858
Come on! Yes, look at this.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.563
The 1.5-litre diesel...

23:51.898 --> 23:57.136
...is no match
for the 3.9-litre V8 MGD.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.773
Come on, Pride of Britain!

24:02.609 --> 24:04.877
Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.914
Ah...ah...ah.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.749
Oh, God.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.018
The brakes don't work.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.725
With the performance
box ticked,

24:18.791 --> 24:21.027
I continued my testing.

24:21.093 --> 24:25.031
In many ways,
the MGD puts me in mind

24:25.097 --> 24:28.034
of an Audi R8 Spyder.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.638
I mean, OK, in the Audi,
the dials would work.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.406
And the switches.
And the brakes.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.442
And the steering.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.045
And it's a bit less
bouncy, but...

24:39.111 --> 24:40.880
both of them

24:40.947 --> 24:43.315
are four-wheel-drive,
two-seater,

24:43.382 --> 24:46.418
drop-head V8s.

24:46.553 --> 24:48.454
There is, however,
one very big difference

24:48.555 --> 24:50.557
between the two cars.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.759
You can't do this in an Audi.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.835
Oh, yes. Yes.

25:02.902 --> 25:07.139
Moments ago I was haring
round a handling track,

25:07.206 --> 25:08.240
and now look.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.011
It's brilliant.

25:15.381 --> 25:19.185
- Oh, no!
Not now, you bastard.

25:19.251 --> 25:22.121
I mean, you wonderful thing.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.123
Choke. Oh.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.592
Yeah, that...

25:27.827 --> 25:30.597
It's on its shutdown thing.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.898
It's just to save fuel,

25:31.964 --> 25:33.866
it goes on two cylinders
sometimes.

25:36.335 --> 25:39.438
Once the engine management
thingy had run its...

25:39.505 --> 25:41.473
diagnostic program,

25:41.608 --> 25:43.309
I was back on the move.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.611
Here we go.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.082
Yes.

25:50.149 --> 25:54.253
Mighty four-wheel-drive
system hauling me up that.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.458
Argh! Aargh!

25:59.525 --> 26:02.294
I'm stopping. Stopping.

26:05.031 --> 26:08.000
Oh, Lord,
that is not right, is it?

26:16.175 --> 26:18.144
As I got going
for the second time,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.980
I realised
I'd been a bit of a chump.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.849
The mistake I've made,
of course,

26:22.915 --> 26:25.451
is that I've introduced
you to this car

26:25.517 --> 26:26.919
before I've really tested it.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.055
That's not
what car-makers do.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.257
They test a car
and then show it

26:31.323 --> 26:34.560
to the press and the public.

26:34.661 --> 26:35.995
I'm doing that
the other way round.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.130
I'm introducing this to you

26:38.197 --> 26:40.032
before I've done
the testing and...

26:44.336 --> 26:47.139
Oh, for Christ's sake.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.278
You little beauty.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.720
Er, now, yes,
what was I saying?

27:02.689 --> 27:07.994
I think the issue is
really you're watching
my workings-out here.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.096
What you really want to see
is the finished product.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.198
That's what
I should have done.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.034
- Oh, Christ's sake.

27:17.036 --> 27:20.239
Right.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.342
At this point, I decided,
for no particular reason,

27:23.409 --> 27:25.712
to scrap the MG idea

27:25.778 --> 27:27.980
and go for
something else instead.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.452
This is what I chose.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.255
A 1980s Mercedes SL.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.825
Partly because
it's the very essence

27:38.891 --> 27:40.727
of quiet, urban restraint,

27:40.793 --> 27:42.561
taste and elegance.

27:42.628 --> 27:47.199
It's a car that was driven
by Bobby Ewing in Dallas.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.368
Mostly, though,
I chose it because

27:49.435 --> 27:52.872
it would fit more snugly
on the Discovery chassis.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.477
This time,
the men worked tirelessly

27:58.544 --> 27:59.979
for nearly a whole day

28:00.046 --> 28:01.380
to marry the two cars

28:01.447 --> 28:04.283
and the result
was spectacular.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.457
It's a car
I have justifiably called...

28:11.523 --> 28:14.093
The Excellent.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.296
The internal organs
from a Landrover Discovery

28:17.363 --> 28:22.802
mated to the beautiful skin
of a glamorous Mercedes SL.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.037
To create a vision of pure...

28:25.938 --> 28:27.273
What's the word?

28:27.339 --> 28:29.608
- OTHERS: Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

28:29.675 --> 28:32.779
RICHARD: Did you paint it
with a brush or a bucket?

28:32.779 --> 28:35.848
It's got those headlights
that swivel when
you go round a bend.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.649
So they point at the road.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.385
OK, let me ask you this.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.820
Which would you rather have?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.789
The Excellent or that Porsche?

28:42.822 --> 28:44.891
BOTH: That Porsche.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.994
Because it's better
in every single way.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.129
To prove my cynical
colleagues wrong,

28:50.196 --> 28:53.032
I invited them
to go for a drive.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.068
Oh, kind.

28:56.135 --> 28:59.605
See? It's an optional extra
for the shorter gentleman.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.274
- No.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.811
- Yep.

29:06.212 --> 29:09.849
- Right, listen to this.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.418
Oh, no, it moves!

29:16.622 --> 29:19.725
We'd only gone a few miles
before Richard and James

29:19.826 --> 29:21.560
completely
changed their minds

29:21.627 --> 29:24.596
and realised that The
Excellent was the best car

29:24.663 --> 29:26.232
they'd ever been in.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.934
No, we haven't.
Stop saying things

29:28.000 --> 29:29.435
in voiceover
that aren't true.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.237
I thought you'd
changed your mind.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.272
No! Maybe a bit.
It's worse than I thought.

29:33.339 --> 29:36.708
- That's not connected.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.110
- No.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.212
- Speedometer.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.148
Why have you got that one,
not that one?

29:42.214 --> 29:44.483
- That doesn't work.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.618
- Not as such.
- Has it got
a temperature gauge?

29:46.685 --> 29:47.987
Not really.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.889
There's a lot of wires
hanging out of the dash

29:49.956 --> 29:51.924
that aren't connected
to things.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.993
You haven't given it
an interior.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.531
RICHARD: I can see the road.
JEREMY: I can as well.

29:59.598 --> 30:03.102
RICHARD: No, there's
a hole in the floor.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.305
While Hammond and May had
one or two minor issues,

30:06.372 --> 30:09.775
they both agreed that
if I were to put my car
into production,

30:09.842 --> 30:12.244
it would make me a fortune.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.513
No, we didn't agree
to that, either.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.748
JEREMY: Look, I've
done the maths. Honestly.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.584
The Discovery was Â£2,500.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.820
Mercedes Â£4,500.
Â£7,000 for the work.

30:21.888 --> 30:26.192
That's 14,000 quid. I could
sell this for Â£120,000.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.927
- No, you couldn't.
- Yes, I could.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.761
A Cayenne Turbo is 120.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.465
A Cayenne Turbo is a proper
car built by Porsche.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.803
This is two scrap cars
glued together by a Muppet.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.838
It isn't designed
for people like you.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.707
What, people with eyes?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.742
People who can dress
themselves in the morning?

30:43.809 --> 30:47.013
JEREMY: I'll tell you exactly
who will buy this car.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.615
People who use
roundy-ended scissors.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.150
Footballers.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.419
- No, they won't.
- Footballers like Ferraris.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.421
Yeah, and Bentleys
and Range Rovers.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.057
- And Aston Martins.
- Not this thing.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.164
To prove them wrong again,

31:05.231 --> 31:10.469
I decided to head for
the nearby Chelsea
training ground.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.372
These are people
who understand cars,
not like you two.

31:13.439 --> 31:16.008
JAMES: Yeah, they understand
cars, that's why they buy

31:16.075 --> 31:18.344
Range Rovers
and Aston Martins.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.946
JEREMY: They buy those things

31:19.979 --> 31:21.948
cos they didn't know
that you could do this.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.450
- I like my car.
- RICHARD: It's shit.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.124
They're flocking to it,
aren't they?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.960
- You just watch.
- Do you mind

31:33.960 --> 31:37.363
if I go and stand
next to something else?

31:37.429 --> 31:39.298
Soon some players arrived,

31:39.365 --> 31:41.633
which gave Richard
and James a chance

31:41.700 --> 31:44.370
to show off their
footballing knowledge.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.972
You're really tall.
You should play in goal.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.306
Yeah, I do, I play in goal.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.008
- I'm the goalkeeper.
- I know that.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.409
What part of Chelsea
are you from?

31:50.476 --> 31:54.080
- I'm from Belgium.
- Oh.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.348
How do you know
they're footballers?

31:56.415 --> 31:57.849
Well, do you not
recognise them?

31:57.984 --> 31:59.051
They're in football outfits.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.987
He doesn't recognise you.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.854
Where's...
Where's Alex Ferguson?

32:02.989 --> 32:05.391
Why don't we ask him?

32:05.457 --> 32:08.560
At this point I dismissed
my ignorant colleagues

32:08.627 --> 32:11.663
so that I could operate
the subtitle machine.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.577
- Yeah.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.481
Take a shot at me.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.817
Well, that's ridiculous.
What can I do with that?

32:31.883 --> 32:33.219
You're supposed to jump.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.024
...flipping horrific.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.826
So you've butchered
a classic car?

32:40.892 --> 32:44.030
Right, watch this.
Little toss...

32:44.930 --> 32:46.032
No.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.500
You need to think of...

33:04.116 --> 33:05.917
- Ow.
- Saved.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.360
Having established

33:14.426 --> 33:17.063
that all top professional
footballers loved my car,

33:17.096 --> 33:19.198
we got back on the road.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.169
Did you get any orders?

33:23.235 --> 33:24.503
I noticed that the car park

33:24.570 --> 33:26.438
was still full of
Mercedes G-Class.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.307
- I saw that.
- Listen.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.210
I could put this
into an auction,

33:31.277 --> 33:33.412
one of those posh,
up-market ones,

33:33.479 --> 33:35.681
and it would sell
for Â£120,000.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.483
It would not!

33:37.549 --> 33:40.286
To prove them wrong again...

33:54.133 --> 33:57.436
Gentlemen,
people are examining...

33:57.503 --> 33:59.438
RICHARD: Yeah,
they are the organisers.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.707
JAMES: They're wondering
about their carpet.

34:03.309 --> 34:06.278
"Handcrafted by a renowned
British atelier...

34:06.345 --> 34:08.547
sympathetically marries
the chassis with..."

34:10.382 --> 34:13.585
- Course I wrote it.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.555
"The interior would benefit
from some minor attention."

34:16.622 --> 34:18.690
- Well, it would.
- With a hand grenade.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.259
Lot number 132.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.528
Soon the auction
was under way.

34:22.594 --> 34:27.566
Ferrari 308 GTB, at Â£118,000.

34:27.633 --> 34:31.603
Lot number 127, start me
with this at 300,000.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.639
And many of the punters
were happy

34:33.705 --> 34:37.909
to pay six-figure sums
for the cars on offer.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.878
At 270,000.

34:39.945 --> 34:43.149
285 for the Countach.

34:43.149 --> 34:46.752
The Countach
just went for Â£285,000.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.387
I think I'm gonna sell
The Excellent

34:48.454 --> 34:50.156
for more than that.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.291
And then it was time.

34:52.358 --> 34:56.027
Moving on
to lot number 138A.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.963
The Excellent.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.431
It's a fantastic handcrafted,

34:59.498 --> 35:01.767
very unusual machine,
as you can see.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.068
I don't want you...

35:03.169 --> 35:07.005
Beautiful, stylish
Mercedes Benz coachwork.

35:07.072 --> 35:09.841
- Very unusual, unique...

35:09.908 --> 35:12.077
Here for sale this afternoon.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.946
Start me
if you will on this at...

35:15.013 --> 35:16.982
Â£425.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.251
At Â£425...

35:19.318 --> 35:21.019
Any advance at 400?

35:21.086 --> 35:23.322
Â£500. 550 anywhere?

35:23.389 --> 35:25.357
- 600 here.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.326
650. 650. 700 now.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.528
We're rattling up.

35:29.595 --> 35:32.898
AUCTIONEER:
700 here. 700. 800 now.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.933
Let's go for 1,000.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.674
Let's get going.
Come on, let's sell this car.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.678
- Â£1,000 here on my right.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.014
- No.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.516
AUCTIONEER:
2,000 if you wish.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.851
It's 2,000 and five.
Two, five.

35:52.918 --> 35:56.087
3,000 now. It's 3,000 here.
Three, five anywhere?

35:56.222 --> 35:58.123
Three, one.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.626
At 3,100.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.694
Â£3,200.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.230
At Â£3,500.

36:04.263 --> 36:07.233
- It cost me 14,000.
- 4,000.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.401
At Â£4,000...

36:09.468 --> 36:11.537
At Â£4,000, any more?

36:16.141 --> 36:17.843
At Â£4,000.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.445
Come and see us after.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.347
You just lost ten grand.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.915
He could have just
thrown it down the lavatory.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.695
It was rubbish.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.666
Hold on.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.669
- You were bidding
on your own car.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.405
Well, a bit. I just wanted
to get the ball rolling.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.806
But even then it didn't work

36:47.873 --> 36:49.975
because you only sold it
for four grand.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.777
It cost you 14,000 to make

36:51.843 --> 36:54.713
so you cost our production
company Â£10,000.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.548
No, no, not true.

36:56.615 --> 36:59.285
- I put a reserve on it.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.287
Â£100,000.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.289
- So it didn't sell at all,

37:03.355 --> 37:06.425
which means
you cost us Â£14,000?

37:06.492 --> 37:10.496
Well, yes, but we've
ended up with The Excellent.

37:10.562 --> 37:14.366
No, we're stuck
with The Excellent.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.402
It's really difficult to
know, working with you,

37:16.468 --> 37:19.004
things like this,
is it ambition

37:19.070 --> 37:21.773
or are you a lunatic?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.410
Sadly there isn't time
to answer that question,

37:24.476 --> 37:28.347
because it's time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.189
Our guest this week
is a local girl

37:38.324 --> 37:43.128
who is responsible
for one of my all- time
favourite pop songs,

37:43.194 --> 37:45.163
99 Red Balloons.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.399
She is a singer,

37:47.466 --> 37:49.435
she's an armpit hair
enthusiast

37:49.501 --> 37:51.703
and she's
an all- round good sport.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.340
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nena!

38:14.693 --> 38:17.763
- I've got no idea. Um...

38:19.365 --> 38:21.433
Oh. Oh, no...

38:21.500 --> 38:23.469
It's hard to see
through the smog,

38:23.535 --> 38:25.371
but yes, that is...

38:25.437 --> 38:28.640
- Oh, no.
- What's happened here is...

38:28.707 --> 38:30.376
Nena...

38:30.442 --> 38:33.044
yes, she's been
carried away by 99...

38:34.480 --> 38:37.248
- ...red balloons.
- Oh, no.

38:37.383 --> 38:38.850
- Bad.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.257
Does that mean
she's not coming on, then?

38:46.392 --> 38:48.760
Well, James, she's floated
up into the stratosphere,

38:48.827 --> 38:51.963
her eyelids have frozen over
and her lungs are inside out.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.932
So that is a no.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.634
It's OK, though.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.236
We anticipated
that Nena may float away.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.039
We have a back-up plan.
We'll activate it.
You sit down.

39:01.106 --> 39:05.010
You see, the thing is...
that more and more stuff,

39:05.076 --> 39:08.179
these days, is being powered
by rechargeable batteries.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.248
You know, phones, laptops.
That sort of thing.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.884
And this is giving the world
a bit of a problem.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.722
Because in Britain, our power
companies only produce

39:16.788 --> 39:20.426
five per cent more power
than we need.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.428
We're only just coping.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.896
It's actually worse
in the United States

39:24.963 --> 39:28.500
cos they produce 16% less
than they actually need,

39:28.567 --> 39:31.437
which means they have
to import electricity.

39:31.437 --> 39:33.739
So what is gonna happen
as more and more people

39:33.805 --> 39:36.074
are buying
and using electric cars?

39:36.141 --> 39:39.077
We're gonna need more power.
We may not be able to cope.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.612
The solution, you may think,

39:40.679 --> 39:42.280
is to build
more power stations.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.915
But if you even suggest that,

39:43.982 --> 39:45.551
weird-beard
environmentalists run around

39:45.617 --> 39:47.152
waving their arms
in the air, going,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.287
"What about the polar bear
and the bats and the newt?"

39:49.354 --> 39:52.458
Anyway, the point is
we are going to need
more and more power

39:52.491 --> 39:55.360
to charge the batteries in
our phones, laptops and cars.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.464
- Where are we
gonna get it from?
- This got us thinking.

39:58.530 --> 40:02.400
How much electricity could we
possibly generate every day

40:02.400 --> 40:02.468
How much electricity could we
possibly generate every day
just during our normal lives?

40:02.468 --> 40:03.969
just during our normal lives?

40:04.035 --> 40:07.939
And what if we could
harness it in some way?

40:10.208 --> 40:13.078
JAMES: This is
an office block in
the centre of London.

40:13.144 --> 40:17.215
Like many office blocks,
it has a revolving door,

40:17.282 --> 40:22.320
which spins constantly
as people come and go.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.957
So, why not simply connect
that door to a generator

40:26.024 --> 40:30.996
and turn all that spinning
into electricity?

40:31.062 --> 40:33.765
RICHARD: And it's not just
revolving doors, either.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.636
Many of us have dogs

40:37.703 --> 40:40.939
and every day we take
those dogs for a walk.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.511
A dog scampers hither
and thither, running ahead

40:45.577 --> 40:46.912
and snouting under hedgerows.

40:46.978 --> 40:51.483
So why not attach it
to a trailer like this?

40:51.550 --> 40:52.951
Dog pulls the trailer along.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.621
Inside this wheel
is a dynamo.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.023
It makes electricity,
goes along these wires

40:58.089 --> 40:59.024
and into this capacitor,

40:59.090 --> 41:01.026
and when that dial
reads 100%,

41:01.092 --> 41:03.261
I'm charging my phone,

41:03.328 --> 41:04.630
So, dog's harnessed.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.932
That was easy.
Attached to the trailer.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.367
All I've got to do
is set her going.

41:09.434 --> 41:12.203
And I've even planned
for that. So, here we go.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.672
Fetch!

41:16.575 --> 41:18.143
Ah-haa!

41:18.209 --> 41:19.878
Yeah! Your favourite!

41:22.413 --> 41:24.616
Chase!

41:26.451 --> 41:27.886
Maybe this dog's broken?

41:27.953 --> 41:31.322
Meanwhile, back in London,

41:31.389 --> 41:33.091
James was charging his phone

41:33.158 --> 41:36.094
from a contraption he'd
fitted to the revolving door.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.208
And even Jeremy had decided
to get in on the action.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.412
JEREMY: This school
sports day,

41:54.479 --> 41:57.148
in my mind,
is a power station.

41:57.215 --> 42:00.185
All we have to do is fit
the children with harnesses

42:00.251 --> 42:03.889
and I could have this
charged up in no time at all.

42:04.856 --> 42:08.059
- Here we go!

42:08.126 --> 42:09.394
Straightaway we can see

42:09.460 --> 42:12.297
that charge is being
produced.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.799
Not much, but some.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.835
Come on, all of you!
Come on!

42:16.902 --> 42:20.305
Put your back into it!
Catch him! Chop-chop!

42:21.773 --> 42:24.743
This is the work of a genius.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.277
RICHARD:
Back in the countryside,

42:26.344 --> 42:27.846
I'd mended my dog

42:27.913 --> 42:30.415
and things were going
well here too.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.384
As you can see,
the dog is now running,

42:33.451 --> 42:34.686
the wheels are turning,

42:34.753 --> 42:36.622
electricity is being
generated.

42:36.622 --> 42:40.025
He's basically
a four-legged Sellafield!

42:40.091 --> 42:43.795
Sadly, however, in London,
it was the middle of the day

42:43.862 --> 42:46.698
and no one had been using
James's door.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.637
As a result,
his phone was dying.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.304
So he had to get radical.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.921
15%.

43:09.988 --> 43:11.690
Nice.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.160
RICHARD: Apart from
a couple of hiccups...

43:15.226 --> 43:16.795
Go!

43:21.066 --> 43:23.568
You'll have to put a little
bit more effort in than that.

43:23.669 --> 43:25.904
...everything was going well.

43:25.971 --> 43:28.073
The power was flooding in.

43:28.139 --> 43:29.507
Oh, yes!

43:29.574 --> 43:31.710
25%.

43:31.777 --> 43:33.511
And we were forced
to conclude

43:33.578 --> 43:36.682
that it had been a successful
day for all of us.

43:36.715 --> 43:39.685
Well, when I say all of us...

43:40.686 --> 43:41.920
No. Look, listen.

43:41.987 --> 43:45.891
I can see why you're
here. Um...

43:45.957 --> 43:48.794
Obviously, fitting
children with harnesses

43:48.860 --> 43:50.729
and then videoing them,

43:50.796 --> 43:52.297
and they're not
my children...

44:01.873 --> 44:06.211
I got... I got 45% charge
in my phone.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.713
I got 41% charge.

44:07.779 --> 44:11.917
I got a different
sort of charge.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.151
Anyway, since we had proved--

44:13.218 --> 44:14.786
well, Hammond and I
had proved--

44:14.853 --> 44:17.188
that it was possible
to charge up a telephone--

44:17.255 --> 44:21.026
I began to wonder
if we could charge up a car

44:21.092 --> 44:24.129
using nothing more
than vanity.

44:26.264 --> 44:30.201
JAMES: In London alone,
there are over 750 gyms,

44:30.268 --> 44:32.470
and every day they are
full of people

44:32.537 --> 44:35.140
picking things up
and putting them down again

44:35.206 --> 44:37.809
so they can be
more attractive.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.813
So why not use
all this colossal effort?

44:42.748 --> 44:44.149
Let's harness it!

44:45.917 --> 44:48.386
And that's exactly
what we have done.

44:48.453 --> 44:49.988
Ten of the machines
in this gym

44:50.055 --> 44:51.456
have been connected
to a device

44:51.522 --> 44:54.225
which produces a smooth
flow of electricity

44:54.292 --> 44:58.229
that's sent outside to this
G- Wiz in the car park.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.868
Right now
the battery is flat.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.569
So I'm going to plug it in

45:04.635 --> 45:07.305
and then after eight hours,
we'll see how far I can drive

45:07.372 --> 45:11.009
on electricity that's been
generated in there.

45:24.956 --> 45:26.491
Come on, you're slacking.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.043
Right. Unplug from the gym.

45:46.812 --> 45:48.814
Let's see how far we go.

45:55.386 --> 45:58.924
Look at this. This is epic
because I'm driving along

45:58.990 --> 46:01.827
in a car, sort of.

46:01.893 --> 46:03.494
No fossil fuel
has been burned,

46:03.561 --> 46:05.063
and no atoms have been split.

46:05.130 --> 46:07.065
Nothing's been fracked up.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.843
Look, there's a man
pushing that pushchair.

46:17.909 --> 46:20.045
Stick a little dynamo
on that,

46:20.111 --> 46:22.948
kid gets some fresh air,
I get more battery charge.

46:28.419 --> 46:31.089
It's difficult to see who
loses from this arrangement.

46:31.156 --> 46:33.624
I get a trip home,
effectively for nothing,

46:33.691 --> 46:36.862
the people going to the gym
feel good, look good,

46:36.895 --> 46:39.630
they become healthier,
the NHS saves money,

46:39.697 --> 46:40.899
cos people are less likely

46:40.966 --> 46:42.633
to have strokes
and what have you.

46:42.700 --> 46:45.136
If one person in a hundred
gets a free gy...

46:49.574 --> 46:51.542
Hang on.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.883
I was enjoying
driving on pedal

46:57.916 --> 47:00.351
and cross-trainer power!

47:03.288 --> 47:06.958
And with that, I think
it's back to the tent.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.900
James... James May,

47:14.933 --> 47:17.903
how far did you get

47:17.969 --> 47:20.171
after eight hours
of charging?

47:20.238 --> 47:22.908
Actually, it was
better than I expected.

47:22.908 --> 47:24.742
I did 21 miles.

47:24.809 --> 47:27.913
Hang on, though. To get
from our office in London

47:27.946 --> 47:29.814
to my home in nearly Wales,

47:29.915 --> 47:33.018
that's 130 miles,
21 miles at...

47:33.084 --> 47:35.120
So six stops at gyms,
eight hours a time,

47:35.186 --> 47:36.521
and the actual driving,

47:36.587 --> 47:38.323
it would take me three days

47:38.389 --> 47:39.524
to get home!

47:39.590 --> 47:42.127
Or, Hammond, just an idea,

47:42.193 --> 47:44.996
you could maybe get
a petrol-powered car,

47:45.063 --> 47:46.932
put some petrol in it,

47:46.932 --> 47:48.466
and be home in two hours.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.468
That's a better...
I'm gonna do that.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.937
Yes. So there we are.

47:51.970 --> 47:54.072
That's the future,
and it's made of petrol.

47:54.139 --> 47:56.207
So we've
addressed that nicely.

47:59.044 --> 48:01.079
Moving on...

48:03.381 --> 48:05.783
Now...

48:05.850 --> 48:07.518
There are people
all over the world

48:07.585 --> 48:11.456
who believe we are permanently
on the verge of nuclear war,

48:11.522 --> 48:14.625
alien invasion
or zombie attack.

48:14.692 --> 48:15.994
It isn't a niche thing.

48:16.061 --> 48:18.496
There's 120,000 of these
people at least.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.765
They call themselves
preppers.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.433
- Morons.
- Shut up.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.235
- Idiots.
- And these preppers,

48:24.302 --> 48:27.372
in order to prepare for
an extinction-level event,

48:27.438 --> 48:29.074
stock their homes
with essential supplies,

48:29.140 --> 48:31.242
they go out into the woods
and practise tactics,

48:31.309 --> 48:35.013
and they create what
they call bug-out cars.

48:35.080 --> 48:36.381
They're brilliant.
Here is one. Look.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.583
- Look at that!
- Yeah! I know!

48:38.649 --> 48:41.519
- No, Hammond,
that is not brilliant.
- It is.

48:41.586 --> 48:44.655
Are you saying we can prepare
for a nuclear attack

48:44.722 --> 48:49.227
by putting some spikes
on the wheels of a Hyundai?

48:49.294 --> 48:50.861
What if the nuclear attack

48:50.996 --> 48:53.031
comes from the back
of the Hyundai?

48:53.098 --> 48:54.732
All you're gonna do
with that car

48:54.799 --> 48:57.568
- is snag your jumper on it.
- Oh, don't be so negative.

48:57.635 --> 49:01.006
In this show you have wasted
14,000 of our pounds

49:01.039 --> 49:02.773
on your stupid Mercedes car.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.442
You have wasted
all of our time

49:04.509 --> 49:06.111
with your sweat-powered
electric car.

49:06.177 --> 49:09.047
This is my thing.
Let me do it.

49:09.114 --> 49:11.482
You do realise
there's no such thing

49:11.549 --> 49:12.517
as a zombie, don't you?

49:12.583 --> 49:15.120
- Don't spoil it for him.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.688
I like the idea
of being a prepper,

49:17.755 --> 49:21.359
so I thought I'd have a go
at making my own bug-out car.

49:28.299 --> 49:31.102
This is what I came up with.

49:34.039 --> 49:38.609
It started life as a VW
campervan, high-top version.

49:38.676 --> 49:41.846
But I've stripped it
of its hippie heritage

49:41.912 --> 49:44.582
to turn it into a vehicle
that can bare its teeth

49:44.649 --> 49:47.152
in a dangerous,
post-apocalyptic world.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.091
And I love it!

49:55.326 --> 49:57.628
I'm so unbelievably
pleased with this thing.

49:57.695 --> 50:03.701
I feel invincible,
ready, prepared.

50:03.768 --> 50:05.536
Which is hardly surprising,

50:05.603 --> 50:08.106
given the modifications
I've made.

50:09.274 --> 50:11.142
At the front,
a battering ram.

50:11.209 --> 50:13.544
You can be pretty sure
the roads won't be clear.

50:13.611 --> 50:15.946
The ram itself
is fitted with spikes

50:16.013 --> 50:17.982
for fending off zombies
at close quarters.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.150
Then, up top,

50:19.217 --> 50:20.918
a bank of powerful
rally lights

50:20.985 --> 50:24.655
to cut through the murky soup
of a nuclear winter.

50:24.722 --> 50:27.758
Of course, not everyone
I meet will be friendly.

50:27.825 --> 50:30.027
So, up here...

50:35.933 --> 50:37.135
...weapons rack.

50:37.202 --> 50:38.436
Everything I need

50:38.503 --> 50:41.839
to defend myself against
cannibals and zombies.

50:41.906 --> 50:44.775
Round here, water. Essential.

50:44.842 --> 50:47.478
Subtle stuff too.
I don't want to stand out,

50:47.545 --> 50:49.214
hence the camouflage paint.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.715
But perhaps most importantly,

50:50.781 --> 50:52.750
the whole of my
bug-out campervan

50:52.817 --> 50:54.185
has been armour-plated.

50:55.186 --> 50:57.555
I really have thought of
everything!

50:57.622 --> 50:59.023
No, you haven't!

50:59.090 --> 51:01.359
All you've done is ruined
a perfectly good campervan.

51:01.426 --> 51:03.394
No, I haven't!
It's brilliant.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.263
It's bullet-proof all over!

51:05.330 --> 51:07.265
Is it?
- Yes.

51:07.332 --> 51:08.866
- Yes, it is.

51:08.933 --> 51:11.369
- Oh, yeah, sounds like it.
- Tanks feel like that.

51:11.436 --> 51:14.605
OK, then, these are guns.
Use them.

51:14.672 --> 51:17.542
- No, on the van. Shoot it.

51:17.608 --> 51:19.444
- Yes.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.214
- Ha! Didn't go through!

51:23.281 --> 51:24.349
Just chipped the paint.
That's all you've done.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.153
What you're suggesting
is these aliens,

51:28.219 --> 51:31.021
they're going to travel
trillions of miles

51:31.156 --> 51:34.325
using a propulsion system
that we can't even conceive

51:34.392 --> 51:37.162
and then they're going to
try and take over the world

51:37.195 --> 51:39.364
using .177 air rifles?

51:39.430 --> 51:41.832
Well, if they do,
I shall be ready for them.

51:44.235 --> 51:47.605
Especially given
what I've done in here.

51:47.672 --> 51:50.708
Inside, I've turned this
once- humble campervan

51:50.775 --> 51:54.512
into literally
the highest-tech
command centre imaginable.

51:54.579 --> 51:57.014
Up front,
carbon dioxide scrubbers,

51:57.081 --> 51:58.616
just like the ones
on Apollo 13.

51:58.683 --> 52:02.420
They will purify the air,
even in case of radiation.

52:02.487 --> 52:06.824
And you can measure
that radiation on these
systems up here.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.294
Water. You may not
be able to find it.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.396
Need to make it.
It's essential.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.565
I've fitted a system
that recycles urine.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.702
Basically you do
your number ones up there.

52:19.204 --> 52:20.238
Operate the pumps.

52:20.305 --> 52:21.672
They send the results up,

52:21.739 --> 52:24.775
across, and into the water
purification system.

52:24.842 --> 52:29.280
It emerges from that as
purest drinking water.

52:33.751 --> 52:36.554
Food. I'm gonna need it.
I've got a chicken.

52:36.621 --> 52:38.856
It lays eggs.
They go in there.

52:38.923 --> 52:42.059
And perhaps best of all,
the pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras

52:42.126 --> 52:43.594
of the bug-out community--

52:43.661 --> 52:45.696
chicken soup.

52:45.763 --> 52:48.299
I love all this. Setting
out into the wilderness

52:48.366 --> 52:50.635
in my little house on wheels,

52:50.701 --> 52:55.139
knowing I've got everything
I need, whatever happens.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.642
What the...?

53:00.245 --> 53:03.047
Am I penetrating
his bulletproof armour?

53:03.248 --> 53:05.883
Yes. And his food.

53:05.950 --> 53:09.254
- Oh! That's my own urine!

53:11.322 --> 53:14.158
- Yes, he is!

53:14.259 --> 53:17.562
I'd get out of the way
if I were you.

53:17.628 --> 53:19.697
The trouble with the chicken
is, it moves around,

53:19.764 --> 53:21.566
- making this a...

53:23.268 --> 53:25.870
- Oh, good idea!
- Isn't it!

53:29.073 --> 53:30.541
Right, reloading, James.
Reloading.

53:30.608 --> 53:32.277
- Oh, yes!

53:44.154 --> 53:46.291
- Good shot.

53:47.625 --> 53:49.860
Sort of game over now,
really.

53:49.927 --> 53:50.928
Hm.

53:52.330 --> 53:53.631
Right...

53:56.634 --> 53:58.436
It wasn't game over, though,

53:58.503 --> 54:00.371
because I went back
to the drawing board

54:00.438 --> 54:02.340
and started again.

54:05.109 --> 54:07.412
Three months' work.

54:07.478 --> 54:09.680
I've used the same basic
interior set-up,

54:09.747 --> 54:12.383
but I've completely re-thought
the armour plating,

54:12.450 --> 54:14.685
so that whatever
those two have...

54:22.660 --> 54:25.896
Now, this is a Scimitar
light reconnaissance tank.

54:25.963 --> 54:30.801
It's small, it's quite fast,
and it's quite manoeuvrable.

54:30.868 --> 54:33.338
Its job is to skip around
the battlefield like a goat

54:33.404 --> 54:35.340
and find stuff.

54:39.544 --> 54:42.347
Now, look at Hammond, running
around in a mad panic.

54:42.347 --> 54:44.882
He thinks I'm gonna
shoot him, but I'm not.

54:44.949 --> 54:48.519
I'm just here
to mark him with a laser.

54:48.586 --> 54:50.455
He's gonna shoot him.

54:57.495 --> 55:01.499
Yes, this is a Challenger 2
main battle tank.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.969
And this really is
a bug-out vehicle.

55:05.035 --> 55:07.271
It's certainly a lot better
than, I don't know,

55:07.372 --> 55:10.508
a Hyundai with spikes
on the wheels.

55:10.575 --> 55:14.379
It'll totally protect its
occupants from radiation,

55:14.412 --> 55:16.714
nuclear fallout, gas,

55:16.781 --> 55:20.385
even a direct hit, thanks
to its incredible armour,

55:20.385 --> 55:22.720
from any known
battlefield weapon.

55:24.955 --> 55:26.591
Then there's this gun,
which is--

55:26.657 --> 55:29.694
there's no other word--
enormous!

55:29.760 --> 55:31.061
120mm.

55:31.128 --> 55:32.730
And it could hit a target--

55:32.797 --> 55:36.133
let's say
Richard Hammond's van--

55:36.200 --> 55:40.505
while the tank itself is doing
30mph over rough ground.

55:41.972 --> 55:45.410
I think, though, today
I shall fire while stationary

55:45.443 --> 55:47.945
because I want to
savour the moment.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.881
OK, thank you, chaps.
If we could stop there...

55:50.948 --> 55:52.182
Right, going down.

55:52.249 --> 55:53.618
Roger. Going down.

55:57.254 --> 55:58.656
Oh, dear!

56:00.791 --> 56:04.462
I've loaded the gun with
a high- explosive shell.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.096
It's a tracer shell,
so we'll be able

56:06.163 --> 56:07.598
to monitor its progress

56:07.665 --> 56:10.568
as it arcs toward the target.

56:10.635 --> 56:12.770
Oh, Commander Clarkson,
this is fantastic!

56:12.837 --> 56:15.139
I can see him right there.
Have you got him?

56:15.205 --> 56:16.807
Yeah.

56:18.275 --> 56:19.510
You bastards!

56:19.577 --> 56:21.946
Oh, just put him out
of his misery, will you?

56:22.012 --> 56:23.147
Fire!

56:37.995 --> 56:42.767
I'm not sure his bug-out
vehicle was quite as strong

56:42.833 --> 56:44.702
as he may have
led you to believe.

56:49.474 --> 56:50.908
Right...

57:00.685 --> 57:02.119
Many months later,

57:02.186 --> 57:05.055
I was ready to unveil
my third attempt...

57:07.257 --> 57:09.093
...an impregnable fortress.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.097
Oh, yeah!

57:15.065 --> 57:16.967
This is bug-out heaven!

57:18.168 --> 57:20.638
I've used as my inspiration

57:20.705 --> 57:22.973
the armoured personnel
carrier from Aliens,

57:23.040 --> 57:26.811
on the basis that if it can
protect Sigourney Weaver

57:26.877 --> 57:30.080
from that metal bitey
thing with teeth,

57:30.147 --> 57:34.118
it can keep me safe
from Jeremy Clarkson
and James May.

57:34.184 --> 57:37.922
Underneath this beast
are the basic elements
of an Alvis Stalwart.

57:37.988 --> 57:41.358
So it was already
armour-plated, amphibious,

57:41.425 --> 57:42.793
massively powerful,

57:42.860 --> 57:44.962
six-wheel drive
and four-wheel steering.

57:51.201 --> 57:54.605
And what I've gone and done
is improve it.

58:02.813 --> 58:06.283
It's got a honeycombed
lattice work

58:06.350 --> 58:08.452
of ceramic-steel
armour plating.

58:08.553 --> 58:10.788
It's three times thicker
than the armour you'll find

58:10.855 --> 58:14.559
on the turret of
an Abrams A1M1 tank.

58:18.095 --> 58:22.967
In testing, I fired a 7.62
round at that hull,

58:23.033 --> 58:25.870
and all it left
was a mark like that one.

58:27.371 --> 58:28.939
This thing is incredible.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.081
Whatever those two
are planning this time,

58:37.147 --> 58:38.683
it won't work.

58:38.749 --> 58:42.687
They won't be able
to damage my soup now.

58:47.491 --> 58:48.826
JAMES: Drone feed stabilised.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.595
Vehicle spotted in the open.

58:50.661 --> 58:53.463
45 stand by to engage target.

58:53.598 --> 58:55.600
45 stood to engage target.

59:04.809 --> 59:07.845
This shell...
is twice as powerful

59:07.912 --> 59:12.382
as the shell we fired
from the tank.

59:12.449 --> 59:16.053
And it can hit a target
13 miles away.

59:20.758 --> 59:22.292
Loading weapon.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.368
Hot room, gun loaded.
Gun ready.

59:31.435 --> 59:32.703
Fire mission,

59:32.770 --> 59:37.642
target number
Uniform Tango 1805.

59:37.675 --> 59:39.744
Altitude 35.

59:39.810 --> 59:42.847
Direction 4600.

59:42.913 --> 59:47.752
Gun target line 130.
Ready 68.

59:47.818 --> 59:49.486
Command approve.

59:49.553 --> 59:51.388
45. Engage.

59:51.455 --> 59:54.659
Command approve. 45. Fire.

1:00:00.898 --> 1:00:04.168
They're bored. They've
realised I'm unhurtable...

1:00:05.535 --> 1:00:06.937
...and given up.

1:00:08.372 --> 1:00:09.907
Five seconds to impact.

1:00:09.974 --> 1:00:11.709
They probably think
it's really funny.

1:00:11.776 --> 1:00:13.978
They probably think
I'm out here all...

1:00:23.688 --> 1:00:25.856
45. Target destroyed.

1:00:36.533 --> 1:00:38.669
- Yeah.

1:00:40.337 --> 1:00:42.072
Now,

1:00:42.139 --> 1:00:44.775
we went through
the wreckage afterwards

1:00:44.842 --> 1:00:48.378
and this is all that remains
of Richard Hammond.

1:00:48.445 --> 1:00:50.314
He's just dust,
and we know it is Hammond

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:53.784
because we found this
suspiciously white tooth...

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:56.553
- ...in it. That's...

1:00:57.922 --> 1:01:01.058
- That's him.
- That's him.

1:01:02.026 --> 1:01:04.294
So, there you are, preppers.

1:01:04.361 --> 1:01:07.732
The tragic remains of Richard
Hammond are proof positive

1:01:07.798 --> 1:01:10.801
that your hobby is
utterly pointless.

1:01:10.868 --> 1:01:13.938
- You spilled him!
- Spilt him on the floor.

1:01:14.004 --> 1:01:15.740
Now you've got him
all over your shoes.

1:01:15.773 --> 1:01:17.808
I know. Even when he's dust,
he's annoying.

1:01:17.875 --> 1:01:19.443
- Anyway...

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:20.778
On that terrible
disappointment,

1:01:20.845 --> 1:01:22.813
it is time to end.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.148
He's pretty much gone now.

1:01:24.214 --> 1:01:25.515
Thank you very much
for watching.

1:01:25.582 --> 1:01:27.217
See you next time. Goodbye!
