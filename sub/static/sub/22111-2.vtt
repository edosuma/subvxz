01:13.606 --> 01:14.805
Hey.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.888
Hey, I'm back.

01:33.559 --> 01:34.992
What do you want me
to make for breakfast?

01:34.994 --> 01:37.995
I could, uh, do my specialty--
cold cereal.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.697
Which, after many
YouTube tutorials,

01:39.699 --> 01:41.198
I can now offer
in Shredded Wheat

01:41.200 --> 01:43.801
and Frosted Flakes.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.936
Anna?

01:45.938 --> 01:48.772
No!
Get away from me.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.842
Oh, you are done!

01:53.512 --> 01:55.212
Come on, guys.

01:55.214 --> 01:56.780
You can't leave me
hanging like that.

01:56.782 --> 01:57.981
Wha...

01:57.983 --> 01:59.616
What do you mean you have
to go to school, Liam?

01:59.618 --> 02:02.753
No, you still have ten minutes
before first bell.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.822
Okay, okay, you're right.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.191
I'll catch you suckers
tomorrow.

02:12.264 --> 02:13.897
Were you really trying
to convince a kid

02:13.899 --> 02:15.833
not to go to school
so he could

02:15.835 --> 02:17.401
play video games with you?

02:17.403 --> 02:20.704
- Once a quitter, always a quitter?
- Huh.

02:20.706 --> 02:22.806
I didn't realize
what a big gamer you are.

02:22.808 --> 02:25.042
Yeah, well, some people
do yoga,

02:25.044 --> 02:26.377
some meditate.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.346
I, uh, play <i>Halo 5</i>
with my teammates.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.814
Your teammates?

02:30.816 --> 02:34.718
Mm-hmm. Liam, Jacob,
Mason and Noah.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.220
Okay.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.889
I know this is so not cool,

02:38.891 --> 02:40.457
but I love it.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.326
And don't think you can
get me to stop playing

02:42.328 --> 02:44.762
because...
- It's what makes you happy.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.263
Why would I try?

02:51.604 --> 02:54.271
So when did I get an Xbox?

02:54.273 --> 02:57.274
Um, I brought it over last week.

02:57.276 --> 02:58.709
Hid it in the garage.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.544
I have a garage?

03:01.847 --> 03:04.681
Hmm.

03:05.751 --> 03:07.751
It's Nell.

03:07.753 --> 03:10.487
Yeah, me, too.

03:10.489 --> 03:11.789
I'm gonna miss this.

03:13.859 --> 03:15.359
You heard back from ATF?

03:15.361 --> 03:17.127
Yeah.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.629
Yeah, they want me
to come in again

03:18.631 --> 03:20.697
on Friday.

03:20.699 --> 03:22.619
I think they're gonna tell me
that I got the job.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.471
Well, they'll be
lucky to have you.

03:32.711 --> 03:33.677
We should go.

03:33.679 --> 03:35.913
Yeah.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.514
Maybe you can, uh,

03:37.516 --> 03:39.149
teach me how to play.

03:39.151 --> 03:40.818
I... I don't want to brag,

03:40.820 --> 03:42.986
but I never lost
a game of <i>Tecmo Bowl.</i>

03:42.988 --> 03:46.123
<i>Halo 5</i> is so not
<i>Tecmo Bowl.</i>

03:55.968 --> 03:57.801
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:57.803 --> 03:59.570
Morning.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.405
Special Agent
DeChamps.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.106
We doing a joint case
with the Secret Service?

04:03.108 --> 04:05.709
Yes. Agent, DeChamps has been
working a long-term undercover

04:05.711 --> 04:08.178
assignment targeting
the Marca family.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.914
Alfonso Marca, from Peru?
That's him.

04:10.916 --> 04:12.983
Our paths crossed
years ago.

04:12.985 --> 04:15.219
His counterfeit currency
was being used to make

04:15.221 --> 04:16.720
large weapons purchases
in eastern Europe.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.288
According to
the Secret Service,

04:18.290 --> 04:21.892
his Peruvian notes are
the best U.S. counterfeit bills.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.961
Now,
while undercover,

04:23.963 --> 04:26.330
Agent DeChamps learned
that Marco's daughter Lucila

04:26.332 --> 04:28.832
just arrived
in Los Angeles.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.868
Lucila is believed to be
running the production

04:30.870 --> 04:32.002
and distribution end
of the business

04:32.004 --> 04:33.737
while her father brokers
the big deals.

04:33.739 --> 04:34.872
Early this morning,

04:34.874 --> 04:36.273
Secret Service used
a covert team

04:36.275 --> 04:37.741
to pick up Lucila,

04:37.743 --> 04:39.676
and, under the direction
of Agent DeChamps,

04:39.678 --> 04:40.811
brought her to the boatshed.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.212
Kensi and Deeks are
on their way now

04:42.214 --> 04:43.747
to interrogate her.

04:43.749 --> 04:46.116
Hold on a second, why is
NCIS getting involved?

04:46.118 --> 04:47.718
Well, in her
undercover capacity,

04:47.720 --> 04:49.586
Agent DeChamps came
across these guys--

04:49.588 --> 04:52.089
marine reservists
Steve Lillard

04:52.091 --> 04:53.790
and Chris Helmsman.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.692
They work for Marca
in America?

04:55.694 --> 04:56.860
Yeah. She thinks they're
smuggling the counterfeit notes

04:56.862 --> 04:57.995
into L.A.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.564
We have a location
on Lillard and Helmsman?

05:00.566 --> 05:02.966
Not yet.
We're still working on that.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.334
Now, Agent
DeChamps would like

05:04.336 --> 05:06.403
our assistance working
her undercover op as well.

05:06.405 --> 05:08.505
DeChamps has
plenty of resources

05:08.507 --> 05:10.841
at Secret Service.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.843
If she wants us in on
this, she's running a pretty tight loop.

05:12.845 --> 05:14.411
Marca's been in operation

05:14.413 --> 05:15.812
for close to three decades.

05:15.814 --> 05:17.214
There's no telling
if he has people placed

05:17.216 --> 05:19.616
inside the investigative branch
of the Secret Service.

05:19.618 --> 05:21.418
I'll speak to
Agent DeChamps.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.453
Anna and I will talk
to her Overwatch team.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.022
I'll get you those
addresses on your phones.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.456
- Thanks.
- Also, let us know as soon as you have

05:26.458 --> 05:28.058
a location on
Lillard and Helmsman.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.374
A girl can't wear
man suits every day.

05:44.376 --> 05:45.542
Ha.

05:45.544 --> 05:47.811
Hey, thanks for helping
out with this case, Sam.

05:47.813 --> 05:49.446
Not a problem.

05:49.448 --> 05:50.514
I've been under three
months, and besides,

05:50.516 --> 05:51.582
my Overwatch team,
I don't know who

05:51.584 --> 05:52.482
I can trust anymore.

05:52.484 --> 05:54.585
We thought Lucila
may be running

05:54.587 --> 05:56.186
the U.S. operation, but after
we picked her up, nothing.

05:56.188 --> 05:58.722
- The deal's still moving forward.
- With her father?

05:58.724 --> 05:59.990
That's what it looks like.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.426
So what's our play?

06:02.428 --> 06:03.994
I'm backstopped as
a mid-level player.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.163
I tried to score a deal with
a guy downstream from Marca,

06:06.165 --> 06:08.031
but the stakes got raised and
they offered me more notes.

06:08.033 --> 06:11.168
So you had to go to your
“financier” for more flow.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.070
Exactly.
But my financier,

06:13.072 --> 06:15.772
Mr. Brighton, can be
reclusive at times.

06:15.774 --> 06:19.476
How do you like your
L.A. condo, Mr. Brighton?

06:19.478 --> 06:21.244
It'll do.

06:21.246 --> 06:23.113
But your wardrobe won't.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.884
Okay.

06:27.886 --> 06:30.754
I'll change.

06:32.257 --> 06:34.658
- Is that the Panama canal?
- Yeah.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.960
What is it you're
looking for?

06:36.962 --> 06:39.229
Hetty. This case
got me thinking--

06:39.231 --> 06:41.798
maybe she went
in another direction.

06:44.969 --> 06:45.965
_

06:53.245 --> 06:55.479
They agreed to let you see him.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.014
You have the money?

07:07.326 --> 07:09.626
Where's the rest?

07:09.628 --> 07:11.728
Half now,
half on confirmation.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.064
That is not what we
agree on.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.332
So walk away.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.733
You're richer now

07:16.735 --> 07:19.536
than you were
when you arrived.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.078
Let's go.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.820
- Callen?
- Hey, Tom.

07:52.822 --> 07:54.121
Didn't realize you were
Secret Service.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.756
Yeah, counter-
assault team.

07:55.758 --> 07:57.859
I bowed out of the army
after my last deployment.

07:57.861 --> 07:59.827
CAT Division's top-notch.
They must be keeping you busy.

07:59.829 --> 08:01.729
Tom Rhee.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.964
Anna Kolcheck.

08:02.966 --> 08:04.265
Got any good Callen
stories for me?

08:04.267 --> 08:05.433
Oh, I got a few.

08:05.435 --> 08:06.667
One involving a clown,

08:06.669 --> 08:09.170
the KGB and a cheetah stands out.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.239
I'll buy you dinner
for that story.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.741
Deal.
But real talk--

08:13.743 --> 08:16.844
without your partner, I wouldn't
be standing here today.

08:18.114 --> 08:19.247
I still owe you, Callen.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.948
We're good.

08:23.353 --> 08:25.418
CAT has Overwatch
on Agent DeChamps right now.

08:26.187 --> 08:28.267
My guys informed me
that your man just arrived.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.825
- Yeah?
- We can support your team in any way.

08:30.827 --> 08:33.094
We're good, but I'd never
turn down your help.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.861
Thanks, Nell.

08:34.864 --> 08:37.265
That was Ops. They got
a last known location

08:37.267 --> 08:38.732
on Steven Lillard
and Chris Helmsman,

08:38.735 --> 08:41.034
leaving a clothing
store on Melrose.

08:41.037 --> 08:42.537
Go, run 'em down.

08:42.539 --> 08:43.770
I got your man's back.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.306
I know you do.

08:49.579 --> 08:51.579
Hey.
Hey, guys.

08:51.581 --> 08:54.315
Uh, Secret Service
handed off Lucila Marca.

08:54.317 --> 08:56.017
I signed for her and
I put her in the room.

08:56.019 --> 08:57.752
Thank you. Okay.
She say anything?

08:57.754 --> 09:00.755
No. She's been rather,
I don't know, pleasant.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.124
She was picked up
by undercover agents

09:03.126 --> 09:06.160
in a foreign land and taken
to an unmarked boatshed

09:06.162 --> 09:07.461
and she's been <i>pleasant?</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:08.863
Even asked me how
my day is going.

09:08.865 --> 09:11.599
Well, that does sound
pretty pleasant.

09:11.601 --> 09:12.767
- You guys got it from here?
- Yeah, no.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.802
We're definitely
pleasant.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.003
Thank you.

09:17.173 --> 09:19.373
Lucila Marca...

09:19.375 --> 09:20.675
Now, does that look like
one of the leaders

09:20.677 --> 09:22.577
of the biggest counterfeiting
organization in the world?

09:22.579 --> 09:24.645
If crime bosses
are now looking like

09:24.647 --> 09:26.080
Leo's next girlfriend,
then yeah.

09:26.082 --> 09:28.616
Hmm, yeah, I'm thinking
she's not just going to admit

09:28.618 --> 09:30.318
running her family's
business in the U.S.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.519
I don't know, I
have faith in her.

09:31.521 --> 09:32.753
You know, I like to
see the best in people.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.221
Let's go.
Oh...

09:34.223 --> 09:35.523
She's very pretty.

09:35.525 --> 09:36.757
Stop.
Mm.

09:36.759 --> 09:37.992
<i>There it is.</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:40.261
Eric spotted Lillard
and Helmsman

09:40.263 --> 09:43.164
leaving that clothing store
yesterday.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.466
All right, well,
sounds like we need

09:45.468 --> 09:47.368
to get inside and
have a look around.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.937
Hmm.

09:49.939 --> 09:52.974
Two saleswomen,
no customers.

09:52.976 --> 09:54.408
You have a play?

09:54.410 --> 09:57.511
I think I do.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.550
Cute.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.621
Oh, now, these are the jeans

10:06.623 --> 10:08.022
I was talking about, babe.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.025
Is this all Triarchy?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.827
Yes, it is-- we get new
shipments every day.

10:12.829 --> 10:16.097
Oh, I'm just obsessed.
I love, love, love.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.698
Can I start a room
for you?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.200
Of course you can.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.842
I take it you're not
obsessed with our jeans.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.378
Not in the least.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.214
You're a good sport.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.416
I gotta tell you...

10:35.418 --> 10:37.284
I don't want
to be here.

10:37.286 --> 10:39.520
Oh, news flash--
not many guys do.

10:39.522 --> 10:41.222
No.

10:42.025 --> 10:44.358
I don't want to be here
with her.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.460
Oh.

10:46.462 --> 10:49.897
Babe,
these jeans rock!

10:49.899 --> 10:52.667
You are living the life, babe!

10:52.669 --> 10:54.769
I hate the word “babe.”

10:54.771 --> 10:56.504
And what I hate more

10:56.506 --> 10:58.572
is couples that call
each other “babe.”

10:58.574 --> 11:00.408
She's sweet.
He hates her.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.243
She's like Gollum,
but instead of One Ring,

11:02.245 --> 11:06.013
she wants a purse and a belt
and a watch, a car.

11:06.015 --> 11:08.082
Hey. S-Sit down.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.583
Breathe.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.687
Tia, get him that water bottle.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.290
Thank you.

11:18.227 --> 11:19.493
I'm sorry, I...

11:19.495 --> 11:21.128
I'm all right.
Let me just, uh...

11:23.232 --> 11:24.832
Let me just sit here
for a second.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.367
Calm down.
You're having a panic attack.

11:26.369 --> 11:27.368
She may look small,

11:27.370 --> 11:29.170
but the damage she can
do at Matsuhisa...

11:42.018 --> 11:44.819
How are you doing there?

11:44.821 --> 11:47.121
Can I get you
any other sizes?

11:48.725 --> 11:50.991
Hey, are you
in there?

11:50.993 --> 11:54.195
She's not
in the dressing room.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.509
I think I'm feeling better.

12:08.511 --> 12:09.877
I can't find her.

12:09.879 --> 12:11.912
She must've left.

12:11.914 --> 12:14.815
Maybe this is my chance.

12:16.619 --> 12:18.152
My cell's on the back.

12:21.190 --> 12:22.523
Thanks.

12:30.266 --> 12:31.599
I'm like Gollum?

12:31.601 --> 12:32.767
Really?

12:32.769 --> 12:35.536
Get in the car, precious.

12:37.373 --> 12:38.606
How does it fit?

12:38.608 --> 12:40.474
Like a glove.
Perfect.

12:40.476 --> 12:42.343
Agent Park will back us up.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.679
Someone from Marca's team will
be here momentarily to vet you.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.948
Do you think they know
we have Lucila in custody?

12:47.950 --> 12:49.917
Still nothing from them that
leads me to believe they know.

12:49.919 --> 12:51.786
We haven't been able to pin down
her exact role,

12:51.788 --> 12:53.888
so we don't know how closely
she's being monitored.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.324
He's on his way up.

12:57.326 --> 12:58.692
You dialed in a way
to play this role?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.060
Don't worry about me.

13:00.062 --> 13:02.997
They're expecting financial
genius, not drug dealer.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.532
They can be one and the same.

13:06.102 --> 13:07.735
Reclusive, nervous. I got this.

13:10.973 --> 13:11.939
Right this way.

13:11.941 --> 13:12.940
Michael.

13:12.942 --> 13:14.108
I wasn't expecting you
to be here.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.043
I thought you were in New York.
Can I have Tina

13:16.045 --> 13:18.145
get you something?
No. Thank you.

13:18.147 --> 13:19.647
You must be Terence Brighton.

13:19.649 --> 13:20.781
Yes, hello.

13:20.783 --> 13:22.383
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.418
Let's take
a seat.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.953
Sure.

13:28.291 --> 13:31.358
Mr. Brighton has financed my
transactions for many years.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.535
Since the numbers
were going up, you wanted...

13:32.559 --> 13:33.528
I wanted to meet

13:33.529 --> 13:35.596
this mysterious financier
in person.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.300
You made your money
in real estate, Mr. Brighton?

13:39.302 --> 13:40.501
REITs.

13:40.503 --> 13:41.902
Real estate investment trusts.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.038
It was my signature mix of
commercial shopping ventures,

13:44.040 --> 13:47.608
residential mortgages,
hotel construction,

13:47.610 --> 13:50.110
giving my shareholders
an annualized return

13:50.112 --> 13:51.312
just shy of 28.4...

13:51.314 --> 13:52.613
Okay. I get it.

13:52.615 --> 13:54.915
You obviously know
your numbers in real estate.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.218
You've been very successful
in that lane.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.220
So why <i>our</i> business?

13:59.222 --> 14:00.921
Well, Mr. Brighton knows
a solid opportunity when...

14:00.923 --> 14:02.456
I was asking him.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.826
Ah, sure.
Well...

14:05.828 --> 14:08.295
It's good business.

14:08.297 --> 14:10.664
Elaborate.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.299
It's simple math.

14:12.301 --> 14:13.834
You pay for the paper,
the flour, the glue,

14:13.836 --> 14:15.769
you pay your artists,
you pay between

14:15.771 --> 14:16.971
three and six dollars
for a hundred dollar bill,

14:16.973 --> 14:18.172
I pay $20
for a hundred dollar bill...

14:18.174 --> 14:20.841
That's rather
presumptive on cost.

14:20.843 --> 14:22.776
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.846
So why <i>our</i> organization?

14:25.848 --> 14:27.281
You have the best quality.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.316
If the paper's off,
the color isn't there,

14:29.318 --> 14:30.751
the texture doesn't
please the touch,

14:30.753 --> 14:33.053
then the equation doesn't work.

14:37.159 --> 14:39.860
I'll let you know.

14:50.606 --> 14:53.307
It was startling, but the men
identified themselves

14:53.309 --> 14:55.676
as federal agents
and I understood

14:55.678 --> 14:57.478
that they were
trying to secure me

14:57.480 --> 14:58.846
in a way that wouldn't
draw attention

14:58.848 --> 15:00.114
if I was being watched.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.249
Do you know why you were
brought in for questioning?

15:02.251 --> 15:04.985
I'm sorry, what are your names?

15:04.987 --> 15:07.821
Uh, I'm Detective Deeks
and this is Special Agent Blye.

15:07.823 --> 15:11.058
And your first names?

15:11.060 --> 15:12.860
Kensi and Marty.

15:12.862 --> 15:15.062
Oh. Beautiful names.

15:15.064 --> 15:17.431
Well, “Lucila” isn't exactly
chopped liver, now is it?

15:17.433 --> 15:19.566
Mm.
So I have to ask again,

15:19.568 --> 15:21.902
do you know why you were
brought in for questioning?

15:23.706 --> 15:27.007
I'm in Los Angeles
to do some house-hunting.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.776
But I'm torn

15:28.778 --> 15:31.045
between the Bird Streets
and Manhattan Beach.

15:31.047 --> 15:32.479
Uh, they're both

15:32.481 --> 15:34.315
lovely places.
Yes.

15:34.317 --> 15:35.950
And equally appealing...

15:35.952 --> 15:37.685
Are you in Los Angeles
to supervise the transfer

15:37.687 --> 15:39.253
of your family's
counterfeit notes?

15:42.558 --> 15:45.092
For shopping and dining,
there's really

15:45.094 --> 15:48.696
no contest; the Bird Streets
are a definite favorite,

15:48.698 --> 15:51.598
but Manhattan Beach, well...

15:51.600 --> 15:53.467
it has the beach.

15:53.469 --> 15:57.004
It does have a beach.

15:57.006 --> 15:59.573
Can I have a glass of water?

15:59.575 --> 16:00.941
Yeah. Yeah, I can definitely...

16:00.943 --> 16:02.276
I'm gonna go grab that.

16:06.949 --> 16:09.750
Los Angeles just always
feels so big.

16:09.752 --> 16:10.884
Sprawling.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.620
I never really
lived alone.

16:13.622 --> 16:17.191
Even as a child in Peru,
my best friend lived in my room.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.360
You're boring me.

16:19.362 --> 16:22.796
Where would you live, Kensi?

16:22.798 --> 16:24.965
The Bird Streets
or Manhattan Beach?

16:24.967 --> 16:27.167
Neither, they're both
above my pay grade.

16:30.639 --> 16:32.673
They don't have to be.

16:36.545 --> 16:38.245
What are you saying?

16:38.247 --> 16:41.415
That you are beautiful.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.785
Hmm.
You are smart.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.087
You don't have to do
the job you do.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.556
Or be with that man,
Marty Deeks.

16:49.558 --> 16:52.259
Who says I'm with that guy?

16:52.261 --> 16:55.162
You could be with me.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.965
Live where
you want to live.

16:57.967 --> 17:01.435
Buy what you want to buy.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.172
Am I still boring you?

17:07.843 --> 17:09.510
Lucila.

17:11.847 --> 17:14.048
Yes?

17:14.050 --> 17:16.717
Are you in Los Angeles
to supervise

17:16.719 --> 17:19.653
the transfer of your family's
counterfeit notes?

17:21.523 --> 17:23.323
It's not that I'm surprised,
I'm impressed.

17:23.325 --> 17:24.992
I know a little bit about
the counterfeit game.

17:24.993 --> 17:26.527
Yeah, it wasn't just the
facts you were spitting,

17:26.529 --> 17:27.928
it was the whole persona.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.630
Well, there's many ways
to play the game.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.332
So who is this guy
Michael Silva?

17:32.334 --> 17:34.001
An American with Peruvian ties.

17:34.003 --> 17:35.169
We believed he was a middle man,

17:35.171 --> 17:37.004
offering introductions
to Marca in U.S.,

17:37.006 --> 17:38.305
but it looks like he also helps

17:38.307 --> 17:40.007
vet the deals.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.745
This whole
U.C. thing.

17:44.747 --> 17:46.413
- It fits you.
- Yeah.

17:46.415 --> 17:48.649
I think I like it.

17:49.952 --> 17:51.552
I read your file.

17:51.554 --> 17:55.489
I heard about what happened on
the protection detail last year.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.891
You played everything
by the book.

17:57.893 --> 18:01.261
There's no way you could've
predicted what was gonna happen.

18:01.263 --> 18:03.464
It wasn't your fault.

18:03.466 --> 18:05.951
Try telling that
to my protectee's family.

18:05.975 --> 18:06.734
Mm.

18:06.735 --> 18:09.670
Think you'll ever go back
to the protection detail?

18:09.672 --> 18:12.739
I don't think I can.

18:12.741 --> 18:15.008
Hmm.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.477
What?

18:16.479 --> 18:18.312
You really want my opinion?

18:18.314 --> 18:20.013
Yes.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.517
If you're not gonna go back
to the protection detail,

18:23.519 --> 18:26.253
don't stay
at the Secret Service.

18:26.255 --> 18:29.423
You're good at this
whole U.C. thing.

18:29.425 --> 18:32.226
Go to an agency
where you can flex that muscle.

18:32.228 --> 18:34.761
Like NCIS?

18:34.763 --> 18:36.130
Maybe.

18:36.132 --> 18:38.499
You got to figure out
what you want to do,

18:38.501 --> 18:40.234
what you're good at,

18:40.236 --> 18:43.871
then go somewhere
where they let you do that.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.907
I'll think about it.

18:49.411 --> 18:51.778
I heard about your wife, Sam.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.615
I'm so very sorry.

18:56.952 --> 18:58.619
Yeah.

18:58.621 --> 19:00.387
Thank you.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.666
We're good to go. 4:30 today.

19:12.668 --> 19:14.401
Who are we be meeting with
to discuss the deal?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.503
Someone with the authority to
give you the terms of the deal

19:16.505 --> 19:17.838
will meet you at the location.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.474
- You can agree to them or not.
- Sir!

19:20.476 --> 19:22.309
Can we meet at my condo again?
I'm really not good

19:22.311 --> 19:23.510
around people.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.181
I'll text you the location.

19:46.123 --> 19:47.856
This is nothing new.

19:47.858 --> 19:50.358
- This is harassment is about my...
- I'm so sorry.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.394
Are, are we... harassing you?

19:52.396 --> 19:55.497
Some people, at this point
in the conversation,

19:55.499 --> 19:58.033
and given this odd location,

19:58.035 --> 20:00.435
some people might ask
for legal representation.

20:00.437 --> 20:01.803
Those people
would do so

20:01.805 --> 20:03.071
because they're uncomfortable

20:03.073 --> 20:05.173
being questioned
by law enforcement.

20:05.175 --> 20:06.708
But not you, of course.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.076
No. Mm-mm.

20:08.078 --> 20:11.413
As I was saying,
this is nothing new.

20:11.415 --> 20:12.981
My family lives
in the shadow

20:12.983 --> 20:15.283
of my late grandfather's
illicit business.

20:15.285 --> 20:16.918
Counterfeiting business.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.955
He was a kind man.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.791
Wonderful to me.

20:22.793 --> 20:25.227
When my mother and I first saw
his estate, it was amazing,

20:25.229 --> 20:26.595
he was amazing.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.730
But I knew nothing
of what he did.

20:28.732 --> 20:31.266
You had no idea he was
the world's best counterfeiter?

20:31.268 --> 20:32.667
Along with your father.

20:32.669 --> 20:35.870
My father is a legitimate
businessman.

20:35.872 --> 20:38.907
He is one of Peru's
most successful men.

20:38.909 --> 20:40.542
He's amassed a fortune by...

20:40.544 --> 20:43.211
By printing fake money and
selling it all over the world.

20:43.213 --> 20:44.679
No.

20:44.681 --> 20:46.881
This is a picture
of your father,

20:46.883 --> 20:48.883
Alfonso Marca,

20:48.885 --> 20:51.086
supervising the loading
of counterfeit U.S. notes

20:51.088 --> 20:52.887
onto a boat bound for Mexico.

20:52.889 --> 20:54.856
You can help yourself
by helping us, Lucila.

20:54.858 --> 20:56.424
We know that the
counterfeit notes are brought

20:56.426 --> 20:58.026
into the U.S. using coyotes.

20:58.028 --> 21:02.230
Once these shipments reach L.A.,
where do you store the notes?

21:05.902 --> 21:07.769
You have to help me.

21:07.771 --> 21:09.871
We can do that. You just have
to answer our questions.

21:09.873 --> 21:12.073
You don't know what
these people are capable of.

21:12.075 --> 21:14.142
So then tell us
why you're in Los Angeles.

21:14.144 --> 21:15.844
Because of them.

21:15.846 --> 21:17.545
To disappear.

21:17.547 --> 21:20.749
To leave the family,
the business, everything.

21:20.751 --> 21:22.817
Leave it all behind.

21:22.819 --> 21:24.219
And where were you going?

21:24.221 --> 21:27.622
Contacts were helping me
with travel documents.

21:27.624 --> 21:29.758
I was leaving for Vancouver
tomorrow.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.226
But not before stopping

21:31.228 --> 21:34.963
at the gym for a quick Pilates
and a blowout.

21:37.801 --> 21:40.001
The truth is

21:40.003 --> 21:42.370
that you were flying
out of Santa Monica Airport

21:42.372 --> 21:44.172
back to Peru.

21:46.310 --> 21:47.609
No.

21:48.545 --> 21:49.844
You must believe me.

21:49.846 --> 21:51.479
I'd love to.

21:51.481 --> 21:52.914
Alas, I don't think I can,

21:52.916 --> 21:54.916
considering you have a private
plane at Santa Monica Airport

21:54.918 --> 21:58.453
registered under a
medical nonprofit.

21:58.455 --> 22:00.355
I don't have
anything to do with that.

22:00.357 --> 22:02.590
Yeah, one would think so,
until one talked to the pilot,

22:02.592 --> 22:04.726
which is exactly what
the Secret Service did.

22:04.728 --> 22:06.261
Turns out they had
some leverage on him.

22:06.263 --> 22:07.395
Yeah, I guess

22:07.397 --> 22:09.064
he didn't report
some of his illicit income

22:09.066 --> 22:11.333
on his tax
returns and...

22:11.335 --> 22:13.234
he was pretty forthcoming
about why he's in L.A.

22:13.236 --> 22:16.338
He said he was
here to pick somebody up.

22:16.340 --> 22:19.407
And then take <i>her</i>
back to Peru.

22:19.409 --> 22:22.210
You have any idea
who that might be?

22:22.212 --> 22:26.815
You got to answer quick, 'cause
we're in the bonus round now.

22:36.493 --> 22:38.526
This pilot seems like a criminal

22:38.528 --> 22:41.730
who's looking to say anything
to reduce his sentence.

22:41.732 --> 22:45.600
It'd be a shame if this
criminal's word is all you have

22:45.602 --> 22:47.135
to go on.

22:48.905 --> 22:50.472
So, Kensi and Deeks
weren't making much progress

22:50.474 --> 22:52.907
with Lucila, though they may
have created a hairline fracture

22:52.909 --> 22:54.175
in her story.

22:54.177 --> 22:57.078
Uh, Sam and DeChamps have
set a meeting to purchase

22:57.080 --> 22:58.913
the counterfeit Peruvian notes

22:58.915 --> 23:01.049
and LAPD got us the ink sample
that Anna recovered

23:01.051 --> 23:02.150
at the clothing store.

23:02.152 --> 23:04.386
And analysis is back.

23:04.388 --> 23:07.589
Let me guess, it's used
to make counterfeit dollars.

23:07.591 --> 23:09.391
Not quite dollar bills.

23:09.393 --> 23:11.326
It is a direct match

23:11.328 --> 23:14.496
to the color and consistency
used to make euros.

23:14.498 --> 23:17.465
So, they smuggle in
counterfeit U.S. dollars.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.234
They're manufacturing
counterfeit euros

23:19.236 --> 23:20.435
and then shipping them out.

23:20.437 --> 23:22.637
But the problem with
counterfeiting euros lately

23:22.639 --> 23:25.073
has been replicating
the holographic strip.

23:25.075 --> 23:27.675
Now, if the Marcas
found a way to replicate

23:27.677 --> 23:30.512
or steal the holographic strips
and they have the ink,

23:30.514 --> 23:31.946
they're probably
already manufacturing

23:31.948 --> 23:33.248
counterfeit euros
here in L.A.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.516
Uh, Callen,

23:34.518 --> 23:37.852
an SUV just parked in the alley
behind the clothing store.

23:37.854 --> 23:40.321
Two men exited,
not Lillard and Helmsman.

23:40.323 --> 23:41.790
And they're leaving.

23:41.792 --> 23:44.025
They picked up three of the
Jerry cans filled with ink.

23:44.027 --> 23:45.894
We got them.

23:49.499 --> 23:51.032
<i>You have our location, Nell?</i>

23:51.034 --> 23:53.968
Yup. CAT Overwatch
is moving into place.

23:53.970 --> 23:56.171
We've got eyes all over you.

23:57.641 --> 23:59.240
Raise your arms, please.

24:12.889 --> 24:15.256
This will be returned to you
when you leave.

24:16.793 --> 24:18.259
Cell phones, please.

24:24.901 --> 24:27.101
Let's go.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.611
<i>We're in place.</i>

24:36.613 --> 24:37.712
They took DeChamps' weapon

24:37.714 --> 24:39.647
and put both phones
in a signal killer bag.

24:39.649 --> 24:41.950
So, no comms, no weapons.

24:41.952 --> 24:43.318
But they got us.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.252
Does it look like they'll be

24:44.254 --> 24:45.420
leaving the harbor
on that yacht?

24:45.422 --> 24:47.989
Unclear, but we've secured
a go-fast boat

24:47.991 --> 24:49.491
in case they're looking
to head out to sea.

24:49.493 --> 24:50.525
I'll keep you posted.

24:50.527 --> 24:51.793
All right. Thanks.

24:51.795 --> 24:53.027
Eric, the SUV

24:53.029 --> 24:55.597
just pulled into an
alley behind this old hotel.

24:55.599 --> 24:57.665
Huh.

24:57.667 --> 25:00.802
Place looks totally abandoned.

25:00.804 --> 25:03.037
Well, the building is listed
as closed for remodeling,

25:03.039 --> 25:06.074
but I was able to access one
of the alley security cameras.

25:06.076 --> 25:08.943
The men from the SUV
just went into the hotel.

25:08.945 --> 25:11.079
We'll go see
what they're up to.

25:15.752 --> 25:17.385
How does she
just sit there?

25:17.387 --> 25:18.520
It's been hours.

25:18.522 --> 25:19.988
She hasn't asked
for an attorney, either.

25:19.990 --> 25:21.022
Yeah.

25:21.024 --> 25:22.857
It doesn't make any sense.

25:22.859 --> 25:24.526
She talked about her past...

25:24.528 --> 25:25.097
Mm.

25:25.121 --> 25:26.729
...how she
grew up in Peru.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.863
On her happy
estate of her grandfather

25:28.865 --> 25:30.737
built by counterfeit bills.

25:30.761 --> 25:32.001
Mm.

25:32.002 --> 25:34.669
Obviously her past
is meaningful to her.

25:34.671 --> 25:35.803
All right, that's it.

25:35.805 --> 25:37.038
We're calling in the meerkats.

25:38.174 --> 25:39.440
Eric.

25:39.442 --> 25:40.875
Uh, yeah.

25:40.877 --> 25:42.710
I need you to look
into Lucila's childhood.

25:42.712 --> 25:46.180
Okay. Uh, what exactly
are we looking for here?

25:46.182 --> 25:47.849
She was close to
her grandfather.

25:47.851 --> 25:48.883
We know that.

25:48.885 --> 25:50.318
So, look into the people

25:50.320 --> 25:52.420
that were working at the estate,
schooling records,

25:52.422 --> 25:55.657
when she moved out, where
she's been living since.

25:55.659 --> 25:57.926
And I'm sorry we have
nothing more for you, but...

25:57.928 --> 26:00.728
But, this is me,

26:00.730 --> 26:03.097
and when you're dealing
with the best in the business,

26:03.099 --> 26:04.399
you can't tether them.

26:04.401 --> 26:06.734
You know, you got to, you got
to let them run free like a,

26:06.736 --> 26:08.970
like a wild salmon that's-that's

26:08.972 --> 26:10.705
fighting its way upstream,

26:10.707 --> 26:12.574
past sharp rocks

26:12.576 --> 26:16.077
and-and grizzly teeth.

26:16.079 --> 26:19.314
That was really going well for
a second there and then you...

26:19.316 --> 26:20.582
you kind of lost it,
didn't you?

26:20.584 --> 26:22.016
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we'll let you know what we find.

26:22.018 --> 26:23.217
Okay.

26:27.257 --> 26:28.423
Enjoy yourselves.

26:28.425 --> 26:30.258
Someone will be
here to meet you.

26:33.530 --> 26:36.164
I know it's not your team,
but our Overwatch is solid.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.466
I'm sure it is.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.906
These guys
are all heavily armed.

26:44.908 --> 26:47.709
I don't like this.

26:47.711 --> 26:49.644
Four men were just dropped off

26:49.646 --> 26:50.979
and are approaching
the yacht now.

26:50.981 --> 26:52.313
Sending you their images.

26:52.315 --> 26:54.215
Great, we will run them
through facial rec.

26:54.217 --> 26:56.217
Copy that.

26:56.219 --> 26:58.252
Marca, Lillard and
Helmsman aren't there.

26:58.254 --> 26:59.420
And the guy
on the right,

26:59.422 --> 27:01.122
that's Michael Silva,

27:01.124 --> 27:03.524
who DeChamps and Sam
met at the condo.

27:03.526 --> 27:06.628
A deal of this size,
Marca would definitely be there.

27:06.630 --> 27:07.929
Unless...

27:07.931 --> 27:10.732
the yacht is leaving the harbor
to go and meet Marca.

27:10.734 --> 27:12.700
Marca's men would
definitely spot

27:12.702 --> 27:15.003
CAT agents following
them in a boat.

27:15.005 --> 27:17.772
And there's no way to alert Sam
or get him any weapons.

27:17.774 --> 27:20.274
We may have overplayed our hand
this time.

27:34.065 --> 27:35.999
And I answered
your question.

27:36.001 --> 27:37.066
Mm, not really.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.701
Actually, not at all.

27:38.703 --> 27:39.869
But I do appreciate the fact

27:39.871 --> 27:42.538
that you think that
you answered my question.

27:42.540 --> 27:44.307
You know what it is
that you don't understand

27:44.309 --> 27:45.375
about counterfeit notes?

27:45.377 --> 27:47.143
No, but I bet
you're gonna tell us.

27:47.145 --> 27:50.013
Peruvian notes are artwork,
nothing less.

27:50.015 --> 27:51.714
The artists make them
with plates

27:51.716 --> 27:53.082
and presses
and paper and ink.

27:53.084 --> 27:56.753
And the technique is handed
down through generations.

27:56.755 --> 27:58.888
Sounds like a lot of work.
It is.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.890
It's time-consuming
and hard,

28:00.892 --> 28:03.226
which is why Americans
use laser printers.

28:03.228 --> 28:05.661
Well, I guess
technology wins then.

28:05.663 --> 28:08.398
Mm, technology is faster,
but...

28:08.400 --> 28:09.966
...laser printers
cannot create art.

28:09.968 --> 28:12.335
That is why the bills
made in America

28:12.337 --> 28:14.871
are so inferior
to the Peruvian notes.

28:14.873 --> 28:16.806
I got to make a call.

28:16.808 --> 28:18.541
You know what it
seems like to me?

28:18.543 --> 28:20.109
Seems like...

28:20.111 --> 28:22.211
you know a lot
about a business

28:22.213 --> 28:24.047
that you know
nothing about.

28:26.584 --> 28:28.784
Tell me you got something
we can use.

28:28.786 --> 28:31.220
Lucila's story does check out.

28:31.222 --> 28:33.556
She was raised on her
grandfather's estate in Peru.

28:33.558 --> 28:35.858
She went to a private
school in the area

28:35.860 --> 28:38.094
and then on to
Pontificia Universidad in Lima.

28:38.096 --> 28:40.329
When did she move to the estate?

28:40.331 --> 28:42.598
Um, she was born
at the estate,

28:42.600 --> 28:43.733
and then she lived there

28:43.735 --> 28:45.533
until she moved to Lima
for University.

28:45.534 --> 28:46.066
No, no.

28:46.070 --> 28:48.037
But she said that she remembers
seeing the estate

28:48.039 --> 28:49.438
for the first time with her mom.

28:49.440 --> 28:53.276
Yeah, that doesn't check out
with the information we have.

28:53.278 --> 28:56.012
Okay, why would she
lie about that?

28:56.014 --> 28:58.447
I mean, she's a perfect kid,
goes to a great university.

28:58.449 --> 29:01.817
No arrests,
no surveillance hits.

29:01.819 --> 29:03.519
I mean, look how happy
and grateful she looks

29:03.521 --> 29:05.388
in that picture
with her new bike.

29:05.390 --> 29:06.889
That's not her on the bike.

29:06.891 --> 29:08.524
What?

29:08.526 --> 29:09.859
Yeah, Lucila is
standing next

29:09.861 --> 29:11.327
to the girl on the bike.

29:11.329 --> 29:12.628
The girl on the bike

29:12.630 --> 29:13.996
is in every single picture.

29:13.998 --> 29:16.532
Uh, that's, uh, Claudia Diaz.

29:16.534 --> 29:18.367
She's the daughter of one
of the maids on the estate.

29:18.369 --> 29:19.969
Text Deeks.

29:19.971 --> 29:21.270
Get him out of there now.

29:21.272 --> 29:23.105
Michael.

29:23.107 --> 29:24.573
Twice in one day, how nice.

29:26.210 --> 29:28.311
I hope you came here ready
to make a deal, Mr. Brighton.

29:28.313 --> 29:29.945
- - I did.
Will you be presenting

29:29.947 --> 29:32.081
the terms of the deal
or Mr. Marca?

29:32.083 --> 29:34.817
Why this fascination
with Mr. Marca?

29:34.819 --> 29:36.552
No fascination. Just respect.

29:36.554 --> 29:38.387
The level of
the deal is high.

29:38.389 --> 29:40.589
I want Mr. Marca
aware of all details.

29:40.591 --> 29:42.124
He is.

29:42.126 --> 29:44.293
Then we can proceed.

29:47.131 --> 29:48.331
You've become a success

29:48.333 --> 29:51.300
in a very difficult business,
Mr. Brighton.

29:51.302 --> 29:52.635
You should you be proud.

29:52.637 --> 29:54.804
I am proud.

29:54.806 --> 29:56.238
But you have a hard time
looking me in the eye

29:56.240 --> 29:57.306
when I talk to you.

29:57.308 --> 29:58.507
I...

29:58.509 --> 30:00.609
Well...

30:00.611 --> 30:02.011
It's just...

30:02.013 --> 30:03.312
Yes?

30:03.314 --> 30:06.148
I've never been good at that.

30:06.150 --> 30:07.983
Looking people
in the eye.

30:07.985 --> 30:09.652
Why?

30:09.654 --> 30:11.487
I don't know,

30:11.489 --> 30:13.322
maybe it's just...

30:13.324 --> 30:15.624
It's okay, Mr. Brighton.

30:15.626 --> 30:17.960
Just forget that I asked.

30:17.962 --> 30:19.528
When you're big as a kid,

30:19.530 --> 30:20.996
you can't fight and you're big,

30:20.998 --> 30:23.799
the bullies come and
they want to hurt you more

30:23.801 --> 30:25.034
maybe because you're big.

30:25.036 --> 30:28.537
I guess that's why
I'm like this.

30:31.509 --> 30:33.843
Kids are awful.

30:33.845 --> 30:35.578
If we do this deal

30:35.580 --> 30:37.680
for your ceiling amount,
which was 35 million

30:37.682 --> 30:41.050
Peruvian, how do
you plan to convert it?

30:41.052 --> 30:42.451
Now, sir,

30:42.453 --> 30:45.154
with all respect,

30:45.156 --> 30:46.922
that's my business.

30:46.924 --> 30:50.559
Yes, it is,
but if you get caught,

30:50.561 --> 30:51.994
it might affect my business.

30:51.996 --> 30:54.096
I don't need specifics,
Mr. Brighton,

30:54.098 --> 30:56.399
just generals are fine.

30:58.503 --> 31:00.102
I have three networks.

31:00.104 --> 31:02.838
Each has its own
separate conversion area.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.073
Las Vegas casinos,

31:04.075 --> 31:05.441
big-box electronics stores

31:05.443 --> 31:06.442
and colleges.

31:06.444 --> 31:08.043
Colleges?

31:08.045 --> 31:09.078
It's new but effective.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.846
There's a high level
of small amount

31:10.848 --> 31:12.448
cash transactions within
college communities.

31:12.450 --> 31:15.117
You talk like a computer,
Mr. Brighton.

31:15.119 --> 31:16.519
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

31:16.521 --> 31:18.821
You don't need to
apologize. I love it.

31:18.823 --> 31:21.090
Can we make a deal, Michael?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.833
This place is huge.

31:30.835 --> 31:32.168
Private.

31:32.170 --> 31:35.137
We've probably just
found the place

31:35.139 --> 31:37.173
where they're stashing
the counterfeit notes

31:37.175 --> 31:38.841
that are brought
in from Mexico.

31:38.843 --> 31:41.777
Yeah, but I bet it's also where
they're making their fake euros.

31:52.256 --> 31:54.190
Try and
avoid gunshots if we can.

31:54.192 --> 31:56.292
We don't know how many others
are out there.

31:56.294 --> 31:58.027
Copy that.

33:04.962 --> 33:07.930
No gunshots.

33:10.001 --> 33:11.700
No gunshots.

33:12.537 --> 33:13.802
I may have
to call my lawyer

33:13.804 --> 33:17.840
and put an end to this
before I fall asleep.

33:17.842 --> 33:20.276
When I was a kid, uh,
there was a pack of us.

33:20.278 --> 33:22.144
These kids were like
my family, you know?

33:22.146 --> 33:23.546
We did everything together.

33:23.548 --> 33:25.381
Must have been
really lonely up there

33:25.383 --> 33:26.882
on that walled-off estate.

33:26.884 --> 33:27.746
No.

33:27.770 --> 33:28.585
“Hey, after school,

33:28.586 --> 33:30.185
“why you guys come up
to my grandfather's

33:30.187 --> 33:31.353
scary criminal lair?”

33:31.355 --> 33:32.955
Probably didn't go over
too well.

33:32.957 --> 33:34.189
I had friends.

33:34.191 --> 33:35.658
Where are you
going with this?

33:35.660 --> 33:37.293
Well, like Deeks said,
it was probably hard

33:37.295 --> 33:38.794
to get the kids
to come up there.

33:38.796 --> 33:41.397
I mean, it wasn't the
easiest drive from town.

33:41.399 --> 33:43.098
So you probably had, what?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.166
One good friend?

33:44.168 --> 33:45.968
One... only friend?

33:45.970 --> 33:47.169
I told you

33:47.171 --> 33:49.171
that my best friend
lived with me on the estate.

33:49.173 --> 33:50.573
This isn't a revelation.

33:50.575 --> 33:52.675
No, it's not a revelation.

33:55.913 --> 33:56.879
I like that picture.

33:56.881 --> 33:58.547
She's very pretty.

33:58.549 --> 33:59.848
Beautiful, actually.

33:59.850 --> 34:01.150
You could be twins.

34:01.152 --> 34:03.786
Claudia.

34:03.788 --> 34:05.821
She was my best friend
growing up.

34:05.823 --> 34:07.056
She was a
charity case, yeah?

34:07.058 --> 34:08.389
The janitor's daughter?

34:08.391 --> 34:10.159
Not a janitor.

34:10.161 --> 34:12.027
Her mother ran
the entire house staff.

34:13.364 --> 34:15.864
This photo I would call

34:15.866 --> 34:17.266
a revelation.

34:17.268 --> 34:20.569
My passport photo.

34:20.571 --> 34:21.536
So what?

34:21.539 --> 34:23.272
After high school, Mr. Marca

34:23.274 --> 34:24.540
told you his plan,
didn't he?

34:24.542 --> 34:26.375
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:26.377 --> 34:29.244
I'm talking about
the birthmark on your neck.

34:37.121 --> 34:38.954
You look really happy
in this photo.

34:38.956 --> 34:42.391
I bet you dreamed
about that bike.

34:42.393 --> 34:46.128
And that day, it was yours.

34:46.130 --> 34:47.896
Wasn't it, Claudia?

34:49.867 --> 34:53.636
When did Mr. Marca tell you
to switch places with Lucila?

34:56.306 --> 34:59.208
When it became clear
that she was useless.

35:01.512 --> 35:03.212
That she'd never grasp
the business in the way

35:03.214 --> 35:04.913
that Mr. Marca had hoped.

35:04.915 --> 35:06.582
So, to take
the heat off himself,

35:06.584 --> 35:10.052
he created the myth
of the mysterious, intelligent

35:10.054 --> 35:11.320
and very beautiful daughter

35:11.322 --> 35:12.554
taking over
the family business.

35:12.556 --> 35:13.856
And you agreed to it

35:13.858 --> 35:16.558
because you figured it would
get you on the inside.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.527
Just maybe he'd let you
run that business one day.

35:18.529 --> 35:19.862
But,

35:19.864 --> 35:22.364
for the last ten years,
he's only seen you as baitfish.

35:22.366 --> 35:24.500
A lure that we bit.

35:26.704 --> 35:29.772
How long have I been here?

35:29.774 --> 35:31.040
Three hours?

35:31.042 --> 35:32.641
Hmm?

35:32.643 --> 35:34.877
Mr. Marca is a very

35:34.879 --> 35:36.545
cautious man.

35:36.547 --> 35:37.846
He has systems in place.

35:37.848 --> 35:39.448
One of those systems

35:39.450 --> 35:41.216
is that I check in
with a security team

35:41.218 --> 35:42.685
every three hours.

35:42.687 --> 35:44.720
I missed that mark.

35:44.722 --> 35:48.090
I have never missed a check-in.

35:51.595 --> 35:53.362
Marca's gonna assume she was
picked up by law enforcement.

35:53.364 --> 35:55.631
They're gonna know that Sam
and DeChamps are undercover.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.433
I understand.

35:59.403 --> 36:00.969
Michael, we've been waiting

36:00.971 --> 36:03.005
a long time.
What's your price

36:03.007 --> 36:05.841
for 35 million U.S. dollars
in Peruvian notes?

36:05.843 --> 36:07.609
Shoot her.

36:15.886 --> 36:18.687
Now, you look me in the eye.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.333
Once it became clear

36:33.335 --> 36:34.868
that the two of you
must be cops,

36:34.870 --> 36:37.470
I needed to ensure that
Mr. Marca and his daughter

36:37.472 --> 36:39.172
were safely in the air
before I dealt with you.

36:39.174 --> 36:41.274
- We have his daughter.
- No.

36:41.276 --> 36:43.243
You have Lucila's friend.

36:59.294 --> 37:01.194
Hey!

37:03.198 --> 37:04.731
Take cover.

37:27.656 --> 37:29.589
Take this.

37:39.267 --> 37:40.033
Target down.

37:43.205 --> 37:44.237
Clear.

37:44.239 --> 37:45.839
All right, stay
right where you are.

37:45.841 --> 37:47.874
Stay there.

37:47.876 --> 37:50.477
Sorry.

37:50.479 --> 37:51.578
Here.

37:51.580 --> 37:53.880
Have a seat,
have a seat.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.249
Have a seat.

Raise your hands.

38:28.817 --> 38:30.617

Stay still.

38:45.901 --> 38:47.433
Nice shot.

38:47.435 --> 38:48.701
You, too.

38:48.703 --> 38:52.071
I may have to make room
for you on my team.

38:52.073 --> 38:54.774
Your talents are being
wasted in <i>Tecmo Bowl.</i>

38:57.946 --> 38:59.879
You're cute.

38:59.881 --> 39:03.283
Marca's aircraft made it
into Peruvian airspace.

39:03.285 --> 39:05.919
They're in the wind.

39:05.921 --> 39:07.353
You were great, Sam.

39:07.355 --> 39:08.855
Thank you.
Thanks.

39:08.857 --> 39:11.024
Don't talk, just rest.

39:11.026 --> 39:12.559
I'll be okay.

39:13.495 --> 39:16.529
While you're recovering,
don't forget

39:16.531 --> 39:18.131
to think about
what we talked about.

39:18.133 --> 39:21.267
What's important to me
and what I'm good at.

39:21.269 --> 39:23.336
I remember.

39:23.338 --> 39:26.806
You should take off,
go be with your team.

39:26.808 --> 39:28.641
Uh, and miss my chance
to ride on the big bus?

39:28.643 --> 39:29.776
You crazy?

39:29.778 --> 39:31.578
You guys gonna let me
turn on the siren?

39:33.248 --> 39:35.748
Looks like I'm riding with you,
Agent DeChamps.

39:37.252 --> 39:40.019
After you, hero.

39:46.795 --> 39:48.895
- Let's go.
- My brain hurts.

39:48.897 --> 39:50.096
I think I like
the days

39:50.098 --> 39:51.564
of running around,
shooting bad guys more

39:51.566 --> 39:54.701
than the eight hour matinee
of <i>Single Peruvian Female.</i>

39:54.703 --> 39:57.270
Hey, you two.

39:57.272 --> 39:59.639
Wow, you guys look fantastic.

40:00.842 --> 40:02.442
Long day.

40:02.444 --> 40:03.977
Yeah? Well, we were
gonna head to the pier

40:03.979 --> 40:05.845
for some crab and beers,
you guys want to join?

40:05.847 --> 40:07.947
That sounds divine.
Yeah?

40:07.949 --> 40:09.082
I'm in, 'cause I'm beat.

40:09.084 --> 40:10.550
You're beat?

40:10.552 --> 40:12.685
Did three guys throw
you down a staircase?

40:12.687 --> 40:14.320
No.

40:14.322 --> 40:16.155
You were in interrogation
all day, right?

40:16.157 --> 40:17.523
Yeah.

40:17.525 --> 40:20.426
So, no shooting,
no running, no fighting.

40:20.428 --> 40:23.029
Yeah, but I used
a lot of brain power.

40:23.031 --> 40:24.631
A lot.

40:24.633 --> 40:25.965
His brain hurts.

40:25.967 --> 40:28.268
It's true, my brain does hurt.

40:28.270 --> 40:31.437
Maybe one of you guys
could just massage this part?

40:31.439 --> 40:35.008
And then work your way down,
to this?

40:36.645 --> 40:38.311
Hello.

40:38.313 --> 40:40.813
Hey. I was just, uh,
resting my eyes.

40:40.815 --> 40:43.716
Yeah. I think we should
call it a night.

40:43.718 --> 40:45.318
Hetty's out there somewhere.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.819
I know.

40:46.821 --> 40:48.888
We'll find her.

40:56.531 --> 40:58.464
We'll let you two catch up.

41:14.716 --> 41:17.817
You look pretty much the same,
except the glasses.

41:20.789 --> 41:23.022
I'm sure <i>I</i> look different.

41:23.024 --> 41:26.192
I don't know who you are.

41:26.194 --> 41:28.895
Harris Keane.

41:33.501 --> 41:35.134
Operation Sunshine.

41:35.136 --> 41:37.637
You don't remember
the helicopter crash?

41:37.639 --> 41:40.406
I remember

41:40.408 --> 41:43.843
that there were no survivors,
save myself.

41:43.845 --> 41:46.779
I survived.

41:50.985 --> 41:53.786
But you left me to die.

41:53.788 --> 41:58.224
I thought you <i>were</i> dead.

41:58.226 --> 42:01.394
I would've been better off.

42:01.396 --> 42:04.664
If I'd stayed,

42:04.666 --> 42:08.601
I would have been captured
by the Viet Cong.

42:08.603 --> 42:09.936
Hmm.

42:09.938 --> 42:13.439
Like I was.

42:14.809 --> 42:18.978
They hunted me through
the jungle for six days.

42:21.149 --> 42:24.851
They tortured me for months.
