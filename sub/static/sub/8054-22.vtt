00:12.835 --> 00:15.037
I would totally shine
his little shoes for free.

00:15.104 --> 00:17.572
- Aw.
- I do say the cutest stuff.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.741
Look, I love a good dog
as much as the next guy,

00:19.809 --> 00:21.943
But this building
doesn't allow animals.

00:22.011 --> 00:24.911
Andy, take him outside.
And shoot him?

00:24.978 --> 00:28.769
- No. Just keep him outside.
- Oh, come on, Ron.

00:28.837 --> 00:32.400
I'm just a little puppy.
I ain't done nothing wrong.

00:32.468 --> 00:36.716
I'm just a puppy. Mm.
I like your mustache.

00:36.784 --> 00:39.581
I wish I could have one,
but I can't.

00:39.649 --> 00:44.580
'cause I'm just a little puppy.
Mm, mm, mmm.

00:44.648 --> 00:46.412
Okay, take him out
and shoot him.

01:06.535 --> 01:09.204
- Fire! Fire! Fire!
- What? Where?

01:09.271 --> 01:10.537
In my belly.

01:10.605 --> 01:13.609
Because the "24-hour Pawnee
cares diabetes telethon"

01:13.676 --> 01:15.010
Starts tonight.

01:15.077 --> 01:17.345
Goodie. Let us know
how it went.

01:17.413 --> 01:19.816
Every year,
Pawnee cares teams up

01:19.884 --> 01:21.384
With the local
cable access station

01:21.452 --> 01:23.219
To raise money
for diabetes research.

01:23.286 --> 01:24.421
And it's important,

01:24.488 --> 01:27.123
Because Pawnee
is the fourth fattest town

01:27.191 --> 01:28.525
In the u.S.

01:28.593 --> 01:31.594
Goes us, uh, Dallas, Tulsa,

01:31.662 --> 01:33.996
And certain parts
of the mall of America.

01:34.064 --> 01:35.063
Well, this year,

01:35.131 --> 01:37.598
I get to program
my own four-hour block.

01:37.666 --> 01:39.533
I know. Exciting.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.435
So, um, I've signed you all up
for multiple shifts.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.270
Yeah. Just to answer phones
and provide moral support.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.506
- From when to when?
- Tonight.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.408
From 2:00 am
to 6:00 am.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.843
- What?
- What?

01:50.911 --> 01:54.214
Leslie, please.
Tonight's kind of a big night.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.484
You know, all my kids
are away and...

01:57.552 --> 01:59.886
Gross! No!
It's jerry's sex night!

01:59.954 --> 02:01.387
That ruins sex and tonight.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.156
- Look, why don't you put on
one of these t-shirts?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.323
It'll get you in the mood.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.192
I stayed up all night last night
making these.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.459
You stayed up all night

02:07.527 --> 02:09.294
The night before
an all-night telethon.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.796
Yes. And here's why.
Boom.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.898
- "diabetes.
Let's dia-beat-this."

02:13.966 --> 02:16.201
Yeah. Four hours
to come up with the slogan.

02:16.268 --> 02:18.703
Four hours to embroider them.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.305
- Time well spent.
- Salad sucks.

02:21.372 --> 02:23.306
There. I said it.
Feel better?

02:23.374 --> 02:25.808
- Yeah.
- I've been doing some thinking.

02:25.876 --> 02:27.710
I'm not gonna ask Ann
to move in with me.

02:27.778 --> 02:28.811
Why? Is something wrong?

02:28.879 --> 02:29.979
No. I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

02:30.047 --> 02:31.614
I love her.

02:31.682 --> 02:33.917
And, uh, I want a partner.
Horseback.

02:33.985 --> 02:35.753
You should ask her
on horseback.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.754
No. You should ask her
in a hot air balloon.

02:37.822 --> 02:39.623
No. She should be
on a hot air balloon

02:39.691 --> 02:40.891
And you should ride up
on horseback.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.560
Oh, wait.
She's in a balloon.

02:42.627 --> 02:44.429
You ride up on horseback.
You point to the sky.

02:44.496 --> 02:46.197
Up there, skywriting
"marry me, Ann."

02:46.265 --> 02:48.733
I think I can figure out
the right way to ask her.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.668
How you ask someone
to marry you is a very big deal.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.670
I mean, they have to repeat
that story

02:53.738 --> 02:54.938
For the rest of their lives.

02:55.006 --> 02:56.272
So you think I should
do it, though?

02:56.340 --> 02:57.607
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Definitely.

02:57.674 --> 02:59.409
Can you get five eagles?
No, get ten eagles.

02:59.476 --> 03:00.910
- Leslie.
- No, it's you're life.

03:00.977 --> 03:02.344
Get as many eagles as you want.

03:02.412 --> 03:04.713
So, tom, you're in
for tonight, right?

03:04.781 --> 03:05.847
I forgot to tell you

03:05.915 --> 03:07.415
I can't make it
to the telethon tonight

03:07.483 --> 03:09.751
Because I have no interest
in being there.

03:09.819 --> 03:11.019
Okay, you're in charge

03:11.087 --> 03:13.155
Of the v.I.P.
Special telethon guest.

03:13.223 --> 03:14.423
And you're never gonna believe
who I got.

03:14.491 --> 03:15.524
People are gonna freak out.

03:15.592 --> 03:16.892
- Rihanna.
- No.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.462
- Dr. Oz.
- No. You're never gonna guess.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.465
- Justin Bieber.
- No.

03:22.533 --> 03:26.803
Ex-Indiana pacers small forward
Detlef Schrempf.

03:26.871 --> 03:29.572
<i>The Detlef Schrempf?</i>

03:29.640 --> 03:31.674
I know!
So it's really exciting.

03:31.742 --> 03:33.809
And I need you to be
his body man.

03:33.877 --> 03:36.311
Pick him up at the airport
at 7:00 pm and then, you know,

03:36.379 --> 03:37.846
Just entertain him
because he doesn't need

03:37.914 --> 03:39.281
To be in hair and makeup
until 2:00 am.

03:39.348 --> 03:41.683
Does Pawnee cable access
even have hair and makeup?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.518
Well, they have
a communal lipstick

03:43.585 --> 03:45.653
And a box of combs.

03:45.721 --> 03:47.288
As a nurse and as your friend,

03:47.355 --> 03:48.722
I highly suggest
you don't try to stay up

03:48.790 --> 03:50.157
For the next 24 hours.

03:50.225 --> 03:51.492
I can definitely do it.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.628
I've already been up
for 24 hours.

03:53.695 --> 03:57.898
But I have a secret weapon.

03:57.966 --> 03:59.299
Nutriyum bars? Leslie.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.268
I know. I know.
They're terrible.

04:01.335 --> 04:04.037
But they give me
an insane 15-minute burst.

04:04.104 --> 04:06.406
Plus my Nana used to tell me
"you'll sleep when you're dead."

04:06.473 --> 04:08.107
My Nana, she used
to say the best stuff.

04:08.175 --> 04:10.510
"don't work yourself
into a lather."

04:10.577 --> 04:12.011
"look where it is
and you'll find it."

04:12.079 --> 04:13.379
"don't put me in a home."

04:13.447 --> 04:14.815
"tell the truth
and shame the devil."

04:14.882 --> 04:16.416
"the devil knows
where you're hiding."

04:16.483 --> 04:17.983
"if you take enough rides
with the devil,

04:18.052 --> 04:20.254
Pretty soon he's gonna drive."

04:20.321 --> 04:21.755
She was really into the devil.

04:21.822 --> 04:23.824
I have not checked in
with you lately.

04:23.891 --> 04:25.325
I'm randomly
and casually asking

04:25.393 --> 04:26.961
How are things going with mark?

04:27.028 --> 04:29.497
- Things are good.
- Do you think he's the one?

04:29.564 --> 04:32.133
The one? I don't know.
Maybe.

04:32.201 --> 04:34.569
- Good.
- I'm here.

04:34.636 --> 04:35.836
What do I have to do?

04:35.904 --> 04:38.940
Um, I have you on phone
answering duty

04:39.007 --> 04:40.942
From 4:00 to 6:00 am.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.712
That's horrible.
I have to nap up.

04:43.779 --> 04:46.982
If I don't get a solid five,
it kills my sunny disposition.

04:47.049 --> 04:49.384
Got enough leg room back there?

04:49.452 --> 04:51.652
Yeah. Yeah. You don't have
to sit so far up.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.354
Yeah, I do.

04:53.422 --> 04:55.723
So...Detlef Schrempf...

04:55.791 --> 04:57.558
Three-time NBA all-star.

04:57.626 --> 04:59.259
Two-time six-man
award winner.

04:59.327 --> 05:01.095
Must've been pretty cool
to be traded to the pacers

05:01.162 --> 05:04.298
In exchange for veteran center
herb Williams.

05:04.366 --> 05:06.466
So you looked me up
on Wikipedia, huh?

05:06.534 --> 05:09.703
No. Everybody knows that.

05:09.770 --> 05:12.506
Just like everybody knows
you appeared in two episodes

05:12.573 --> 05:16.410
<i>Of the German soap opera
gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten.</i>

05:16.477 --> 05:18.078
What, you a big fan
of that show?

05:18.146 --> 05:19.179
Huge fan.

05:19.247 --> 05:21.415
Huh? Oh, 6'10".

05:21.483 --> 05:25.919
- I'm 5'6"
and three-quarters.

05:25.987 --> 05:27.354
All right, team,
you guys psyched?

05:27.422 --> 05:28.822
Just remember,
all you need to do

05:28.890 --> 05:30.290
Is take down everybody's name
and address

05:30.358 --> 05:32.193
And ask them how much
they want to donate.

05:32.261 --> 05:33.494
Hey, do these phones dial out?

05:33.562 --> 05:35.697
- Yes. Why?
- No reason.

05:35.764 --> 05:38.233
Leslie, you know what,
my phone has 25 lines.

05:38.301 --> 05:39.835
I think it might be
a switchboard.

05:39.902 --> 05:41.703
Congratulations then.
You got the most lines.

05:41.771 --> 05:44.006
Figure it out, jerry.
Come on, jerry.

05:44.074 --> 05:45.875
Everyone else has one line.

05:45.942 --> 05:48.377
Oh, so, Leslie,

05:48.444 --> 05:50.712
I hear you're gonna be in front
of the camera this year.

05:50.779 --> 05:52.647
- Yeah. It's exciting.
- Cut the chatter.

05:52.715 --> 05:55.683
Telehosting not as easy
as it looks, okay?

05:55.751 --> 05:59.219
This isn't c-span.
This is local access 46.

05:59.287 --> 06:01.989
Don't blow it.

06:02.056 --> 06:03.223
Good evening and welcome

06:03.291 --> 06:07.060
To the 10th annual Pawnee cares
diabetes telethon.

06:07.128 --> 06:10.030
<i>I'm Pawnee today's
Joan Callamezzo.</i>

06:10.098 --> 06:12.934
And I am not a crook. Brr.

06:13.002 --> 06:14.469
No, he's not.

06:14.537 --> 06:16.638
What time is it?
I'm tired already.

06:16.706 --> 06:18.373
It's 8:03.

06:18.441 --> 06:20.876
Your shift doesn't start
for another six hours.

06:20.944 --> 06:22.111
Ugh.

06:22.179 --> 06:24.781
Diabetes. Yuck.

06:24.848 --> 06:27.083
Tonight we're hoping
the people of Pawnee

06:27.151 --> 06:30.586
Dig their big, chubby hands
into their plus-sized pockets

06:30.654 --> 06:32.154
And donate generously.

06:32.222 --> 06:34.423
We're wacky stuff.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.657
Stop it.

06:35.725 --> 06:39.260
Coming up, a very special
video presentation

06:39.328 --> 06:43.063
Called "even my tongue is fat:
The story of Pawnee."

06:43.131 --> 06:45.098
But right now, to begin with,

06:45.166 --> 06:47.601
Let's start things off
on our telethon with a song.

06:47.668 --> 06:52.473

to wake you up at 1:45.

07:34.552 --> 07:35.619
- Yeah.
- It's 1:45 now.

07:35.687 --> 07:36.954
I'm up.

Hey, before you go on,

07:40.058 --> 07:41.359
Can I just talk to you
about something?

07:41.426 --> 07:44.162
Uh, wait a minute. Sorry.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.364
It's tom. He may have
a Schrempf problem.

07:46.432 --> 07:47.599
- Okay.
- You understand.

07:47.666 --> 07:49.267
- I do. Take it.
- Okay. To be continued, Ann.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.668
I promise.
We'll talk later.

07:50.736 --> 07:51.802
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.771
Hey, hi.
Are you on your way?

07:53.839 --> 07:56.541
The snakehole is booming!

07:56.608 --> 07:59.377
People are loving
Detlef Schrempf.

07:59.445 --> 08:00.878
I had no idea
professional athletes

08:00.946 --> 08:02.213
Were so popular.

08:02.281 --> 08:03.381
That's awesome.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.615
But you promised
to get him here.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.050
Get him here.
Don't worry.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.186
We're leaving soon, all right?
Bye.

08:08.253 --> 08:09.654
Whoa, you can't leave.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.023
Tommy, this is the most business
the club's done in months.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.591
But I got to get him
to the telethon.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.629
He's not going anywhere.

08:17.696 --> 08:19.464
Okay. Oh, god. Problem!

08:19.531 --> 08:22.366
Um, Andy, I know I told you
that you were going on

08:22.434 --> 08:24.168
At 3:00 am
after the Detlef Schrempf

08:24.236 --> 08:25.603
Interview
and career retrospective,

08:25.671 --> 08:26.805
But you're going on now.

08:26.872 --> 08:27.872
You're kicking things off.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.175
Whoa. Sweet. Headlining.

08:30.242 --> 08:32.610
Yeah, at 2:00
on cable access.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.846
Yeah. Let's go.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.017
So how are things going
with you two?

08:40.085 --> 08:42.086
They're going really well.
We're gonna get married.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.755
And I'm pregnant
with his child.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.059
Thank you, Joan.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.028
There are two types
of diabetes,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.230
But only one type of caring.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.700
Type-1 caring.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.635
And tonight, god willing,

08:55.703 --> 08:57.571
We will all be stricken
with that.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.406
There's a lot of fun stuff
coming up.

08:59.473 --> 09:02.243
Indiana pacers legend
Detlef Schrempf

09:02.310 --> 09:04.745
Will be joining us
in the studio later on.

09:04.813 --> 09:05.980
Uh, but until then,

09:06.048 --> 09:07.282
I would like to introduce

09:07.349 --> 09:10.217
One of the hottest bands
in Pawnee.

09:10.285 --> 09:13.186

See the board?

09:22.295 --> 09:23.862
When my shift is done,

09:23.929 --> 09:26.764
That board is gonna read
$20,000.

09:30.636 --> 09:31.903
Pawnee cares.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.473
Hi, yes,
I'd like to donate $50, please.

any donations coming in.

09:47.427 --> 09:48.894
I'm tired of waiting for people
to call us.

09:48.962 --> 09:50.462
Let's call them.
Everybody call somebody.

09:50.530 --> 09:51.830
Leslie, it's the middle
of the night.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.131
Well, then good.
They'll be home.

09:53.198 --> 09:54.766
Donna, someone good?
No.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.234
I'm talking to my brother
George.

09:56.302 --> 09:58.168
You're not supposed to receive
personal phone calls.

09:58.236 --> 09:59.470
Oh, I called him.

09:59.537 --> 10:01.104
He's in Liberia visiting
my uncle.

10:01.172 --> 10:03.273
<i>Wants to know what happened
on lost.</i>

10:03.340 --> 10:04.941
- Oh, thank god.
- There you go.

10:05.009 --> 10:07.409
Thank you.

10:07.477 --> 10:08.977
Did you put cream in this?

10:09.045 --> 10:12.481
- Uh, yeah. Did I screw up?
- No. I can drink it.

10:12.549 --> 10:13.916
Guys, has anyone seen tom?

10:13.984 --> 10:16.385
The ultimate celebrity,
I think, to hang out with

10:16.453 --> 10:20.290
For a night
would be criss angel.

10:20.357 --> 10:21.758
Like, you'll be talking to him

10:21.826 --> 10:24.761
And then he would just turn
into fire. Ha ha ha!

10:24.828 --> 10:27.864
Brooks brothers boys
is, like, the cuts are slimmer

10:27.932 --> 10:29.065
And it's cheaper.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.533
Win, win.

10:30.601 --> 10:32.501
You ever talk to someone
and you're just, like,

10:32.569 --> 10:34.570
"oh, we're gonna be
best friends"?

10:34.638 --> 10:36.305
I'm getting that, like,
right now.

10:36.373 --> 10:40.475
He had two beers.
Light beers.

10:40.543 --> 10:43.177
I need you to make
that out to Wendy.

10:43.245 --> 10:45.546
"tom is an amazing guy.

10:45.614 --> 10:47.581
"you never should have
left him.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.316
"you made a huge mistaken

10:49.384 --> 10:51.285
"and you're probably
gonna die alone.

10:51.353 --> 10:52.787
Love, Detlef."

10:52.855 --> 10:54.022
Do you know what,

10:54.090 --> 10:55.624
I think we should be heading
to that telethon.

10:55.691 --> 10:57.827
Yes. We will definitely
go to the telethon soon.

11:13.577 --> 11:14.944
Ah! Gah!

11:15.012 --> 11:16.412
Were you having a bad dream?

11:16.480 --> 11:20.015
No. I suffer from a disorder
called "sleep fighting."

11:20.083 --> 11:23.251
- Wow, that must be terrible.
- Only when I'm losing.

11:23.319 --> 11:24.919
Look, I'm freaking out, okay?

11:24.987 --> 11:27.689
Tom is not here.
And he's got Detlef Schrempf.

11:27.756 --> 11:29.390
And I have three hours to fill.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.392
I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

11:31.459 --> 11:33.261
Don't go back to sleep, okay?
I need you to wake up!

11:33.329 --> 11:35.964
Ron, come on! Help me!

11:36.032 --> 11:37.366
Attaboy.

11:37.433 --> 11:40.970
I am only here because I owe
Leslie a thousand favors.

11:41.038 --> 11:43.306
I'm not big on charities.

11:43.374 --> 11:46.777
Give a man a fish
and you feed him for a day.

11:46.845 --> 11:50.648
Don't teach a man to fish
and you feed yourself.

11:50.716 --> 11:53.751
He's a grown man.
Fishing's not that hard.

11:56.955 --> 12:00.524
Okay, that was the national
anthem of Canada.

12:00.592 --> 12:05.262
And now I'm going to see
how long I can hold a d-chord.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.399
April, will you call
some of the rec center teachers

12:08.467 --> 12:09.534
And see if they want
to come on down

12:09.602 --> 12:10.769
And show off
their special skills?

12:10.836 --> 12:11.936
Yes. Nod your head "yes."

12:12.004 --> 12:15.507
I can do magic.

12:15.575 --> 12:16.641
Egg, milady?

12:16.709 --> 12:18.510
Jerry, that's disgusting
and fake!

12:18.578 --> 12:20.746
Oh, my god. It's real.
Go up there and do that.

12:20.814 --> 12:23.015
- I--you broke my egg.
- You don't have a second egg?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.417
No, but I'm a very good
piano player.

12:24.485 --> 12:25.919
I'd be happy to go up there
and give it a shot.

12:25.987 --> 12:29.689
Why are you wasting my time?
This is really serious!

12:29.757 --> 12:31.724
You go keep your eye out
for tom.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.459
I got this covered.

12:33.527 --> 12:35.828
When re-caning an old chair,

12:35.895 --> 12:38.897
One needs to make sure that one
has all the right elements

12:38.964 --> 12:39.897
In place.

12:39.965 --> 12:42.299
Over. Under.

12:42.367 --> 12:45.969
And...You guessed it.
Over.

12:46.037 --> 12:48.105
God, he's actually
losing money.

12:48.173 --> 12:52.610
Over. Under. This chair's
almost caning itself.

12:52.677 --> 12:57.015
- No, sir. If you want to make
a donation, you have to--

12:57.083 --> 13:00.018
Yeah, that sounds really cool.

13:00.086 --> 13:03.723
You sound cool.
You sound really strong.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.525
Hey, why don't you forget
about the donation

13:05.592 --> 13:08.495
And just come down here
and meet me in person.

13:08.562 --> 13:11.898
What? Oh, my god.

13:11.966 --> 13:16.603
You're so...Funny
and you're--funny. Bye.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.872
Hi.
Hey.

13:18.939 --> 13:20.273
Funny girl you were talking to?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.842
When it comes
to preparing taxes...

13:22.910 --> 13:25.145
Oh, my god.
This is a disaster.

13:25.212 --> 13:27.447
The only thing that's taxing

13:27.514 --> 13:29.915
Is deciding which software
to buy.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.784
I am completely screwed.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.053
I have no Schrempf,
no backup plan,

13:34.120 --> 13:35.421
No more nutriyum bars.

13:35.488 --> 13:39.190
What do people want to watch?
Cute animals on a bike?

13:39.258 --> 13:40.892
No time to train one.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.794
Hot people kissing?

13:42.861 --> 13:45.363
I don't know,
maybe mark and Ann would...

13:46.732 --> 13:48.833
Have you ever seen
this man sleep?

13:48.901 --> 13:50.869
It's like underwater ballet.

13:50.936 --> 13:53.271
- I have a great idea.
- Uh, what's that?

13:53.339 --> 13:57.108
- I think you should propose
to Ann tonight--today--

13:57.176 --> 14:00.813
Whatever it is--
on camera for diabetes.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.450
- Really?
- Yes. I would be so cool.

14:04.518 --> 14:06.119
Don't you remember
when Ahmad Rashad proposed

14:06.187 --> 14:07.621
To Mrs. Cosby on TV?

14:07.688 --> 14:10.156
- No.
- I do. And most women do.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.760
- On television though.
- Yes, but...

14:13.828 --> 14:14.894
Oh, my god.

14:14.962 --> 14:16.496
We talked about it being
something big.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.830
Right.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.398
And I don't think we can get
a hot air balloon

14:19.466 --> 14:20.399
This time of night.

14:20.467 --> 14:23.101
I have my grandma's ring.

14:23.169 --> 14:25.570
I guess I could go home
and get it.

14:25.638 --> 14:28.472
<i>Is there a story behind it?
Was she on the titanic?</i>

14:28.540 --> 14:30.308
<i>Was she on the titanic?</i>

14:30.375 --> 14:32.643
No.
She was just my grandma.

14:32.711 --> 14:36.648
It would make a great story.
I trust Leslie.

14:36.715 --> 14:40.219
I don't know.
What do you think I should do?

14:41.287 --> 14:44.223
And that concludes a quick look

14:44.291 --> 14:46.459
At quickbook--s pro.

14:46.527 --> 14:49.196
- Quickbook--s!

14:49.264 --> 14:52.700
Okay. Thank you so much,
Barney, for...That.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.069
Thank you. Um...Go.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.504
We'd like to make
a quick announcement.

14:57.571 --> 15:00.774
Detlef Schrempf is temporary,
um, delayed.

15:00.842 --> 15:03.544
But, uh, coming soon,
a really amazing thing

15:03.612 --> 15:04.611
Is going to happen.

15:04.679 --> 15:06.313
So get your wallets out

15:06.381 --> 15:08.148
Or get your handkerchiefs out.

15:08.216 --> 15:10.551
Or get your tissues out
if you're like me

15:10.619 --> 15:12.120
And think handkerchiefs
are gross.

15:12.187 --> 15:15.723
For now, please, let's take
a look at this moving video

15:15.791 --> 15:20.796
<i>The widening of America.</i>

15:22.499 --> 15:26.202
No. Ann. Wait. Ann. Ann!
Where are you going?

15:26.270 --> 15:27.570
Just stay
a little while longer.

15:27.638 --> 15:29.338
Leslie, I'm so beat.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.806
I'm so sorry
that I've been crazy.

15:30.874 --> 15:32.174
What did you want
to talk to me about?

15:32.242 --> 15:33.742
Oh, no worries.
It can wait.

15:33.810 --> 15:36.211
No, no. What is it?

15:36.279 --> 15:38.246
I think I need to break up
with mark.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.621
I've just been feeling
for a while

15:44.688 --> 15:45.789
Like something's missing.

15:45.856 --> 15:47.791
And I kept thinking
about the question

15:47.858 --> 15:50.894
You asked me today about whether
or not he's the one.

15:50.961 --> 15:53.496
And he's not.
Mark really loves you.

15:53.563 --> 15:56.499
I think he's ready to take this
to the next step.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.434
He doesn't know
what he's ready for,

15:58.501 --> 15:59.835
But I think I do.

15:59.903 --> 16:01.404
Guess you're just gonna have
to marry him

16:01.472 --> 16:02.472
And figure it out.

16:02.539 --> 16:03.806
- No.
- No. No.

16:03.874 --> 16:05.408
Why would you do that?
No. No.

16:05.475 --> 16:08.010
No. No.
Good for you, Ann.

16:08.078 --> 16:11.414
Hey, mark, it's Leslie.
Um, change of plans.

16:11.481 --> 16:13.450
Can you call me back?
Tom, get here! Now!

16:13.517 --> 16:16.186
Call me! Bye!
Hey, Leslie, it's Leslie.

16:16.254 --> 16:20.124
Hang in there.
I love you. Bye.

16:20.192 --> 16:23.995
- Please be April. April?
- Yeah?

16:24.063 --> 16:26.431
It's Joe. From the phone.
I made you laugh.

16:26.499 --> 16:28.968
You said come down.

16:29.036 --> 16:30.636
Listen, my van's out back.
Let's roll.

16:30.704 --> 16:33.906
- Ew. No. Please leave.
- Where you going?

16:33.974 --> 16:37.010
- Hey. What's up?
- Is this guy bothering you?

16:37.078 --> 16:39.779
No. I'm bothering you
for bothering her.

16:39.847 --> 16:41.147
Are you her bodyguard?

16:41.215 --> 16:42.849
I mean, she's an adult.

16:42.917 --> 16:44.317
I think she can decide
on her own

16:44.385 --> 16:45.685
What train she wants to ride.

16:45.753 --> 16:47.520
- It's time to go.
- Whatever, man.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.089
I work for the sewage
department.

16:49.157 --> 16:51.158
I'm up to my waist
in hot snizz.

16:51.226 --> 16:53.761
- Take a walk. Bye-bye.

16:57.966 --> 17:01.269
Okay. Heads.

17:01.336 --> 17:04.137
Oh, boy.
What is gonna happen next?

17:04.205 --> 17:06.540
Okay, my second favorite
episode,

17:06.608 --> 17:08.442
Monica's making dinner.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.611
And joey is mad at chandler

17:10.679 --> 17:11.878
Because chandler made out
with his girlfriend.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.380
So joey says,
"get in the box."

17:13.448 --> 17:15.648
I forgot to tell you
there's a box.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.417
Oh, and it's thanksgiving day.

17:17.484 --> 17:19.619
So they get ready to eat.
What is Ross and Rachel doing?

17:19.688 --> 17:20.855
Oh, they're fighting.

17:20.923 --> 17:22.958
So Ross, Rachel,
joey, chandler,

17:23.025 --> 17:24.892
Monica, and phoebe
are all together.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.728
Although is phoebe there?

17:31.066 --> 17:32.100
Yes. So...

17:32.168 --> 17:34.335
I will now drink
eight glasses of milk

17:34.403 --> 17:35.904
In three minutes.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.673
No. No, you won't.
No, you won't.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.241
Because if you do that,
you will die.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.576
Oh.

17:49.954 --> 17:51.554
♪ ♪

17:56.794 --> 17:58.528
All right. Okay.
Enough of that racket.

17:58.595 --> 18:03.899
Um, well, Pawnee, it's, um,
almost 6:00 in the morning.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.301
And, uh, we need to keep
those donations coming in.

18:06.369 --> 18:09.638
I know we promised
a special event coming up and...

18:09.706 --> 18:11.306
- Leslie.
- No.

18:11.374 --> 18:12.474
Should I come up now?

18:12.542 --> 18:14.476
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No.

18:14.544 --> 18:15.977
No. What we're gonna do
is we're gonna pull

18:16.045 --> 18:16.978
Our pants down.

18:17.046 --> 18:18.079
That's what we're gonna do.

18:18.147 --> 18:19.481
Everyone's gonna pull
their pants down

18:19.549 --> 18:21.116
For diabetes, okay?
On 1, 2.

18:21.184 --> 18:24.452
♪ tall and tan
and young and lovely ♪

18:24.520 --> 18:26.955
♪ turn my swag on ♪

18:27.023 --> 18:29.291
♪ took a look in the mirror,
said "what's up?" ♪

18:29.358 --> 18:31.259
Detlef, are you sure
you don't want me to drive?

18:31.327 --> 18:32.461
I'm good to drive.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.262
You want to come over
and play video games?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.965
Oh, pull over, man.
That place has good chicken.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.566
I'm hungry.

18:41.403 --> 18:42.970
You just love flashing
your ass, don't you?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.638
When it's
for a good cause, Joan.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.273
- ♪ what's up? ♪
- Hey, look who's here.

18:47.341 --> 18:50.610
Wake up, Pawnee,
Tommy Timberlake's in the house.

18:50.678 --> 18:52.745
And you know who else
is with me?

18:52.813 --> 18:56.450
Detlef Schrempf!

18:56.518 --> 18:58.219
Tell them what they won, son!

18:58.287 --> 18:59.521
Hey, thanks, tom.

18:59.588 --> 19:02.057
Well, on behalf of the Detlef
Schrempf foundation,

19:02.125 --> 19:04.260
I'd like to present
this check for $5,000

19:04.327 --> 19:06.262
For diabetes research.

19:06.329 --> 19:09.665
Oh, man! Yeah.

19:09.733 --> 19:14.203
Thank you very much.
Wow. Wow. Big man, big check.

19:14.270 --> 19:19.140
By the way, I'm drunk!

19:19.208 --> 19:20.342
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.743
I don't understand
what happened.

19:21.811 --> 19:22.977
I'm sorry.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.312
I think I was a little tired
when I told you

19:24.380 --> 19:25.713
That you should do that.

19:25.781 --> 19:27.614
I don't think that that's
something Ann wants.

19:27.682 --> 19:29.182
Not on TV.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.418
So that's why you pull
your pants down.

19:31.485 --> 19:35.221
Yeah. Wait.
What did I do?

19:35.289 --> 19:38.024
It's 6:04 am
and I'm Perd Hapley

19:38.092 --> 19:39.859
Of channel four
eyewitness news.

19:39.927 --> 19:41.761
And the story
of this next dance

19:41.829 --> 19:43.531
Is that it's called
"the worm."

19:50.139 --> 19:53.476
- Good morning, Knope.
- Morning, Ron.

19:53.543 --> 19:55.177
Everything running smoothly?

19:55.245 --> 19:57.246
You know, I'm happy
to go back out there

19:57.313 --> 19:59.047
And demonstrate
more of my skills.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.249
How to start a fire
without matches.

20:01.317 --> 20:02.884
How to build a cribbage board.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.988
- No. I'm okay. Thanks.
- Get some sleep.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.091
Aye, aye, captain.

20:11.963 --> 20:14.997
What the [bleep]
are you doing, Perd Hapley?

20:17.234 --> 20:18.567
Hey.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.203
Leslie,
what are you doing here?

20:20.271 --> 20:21.505
Why aren't you sleeping?

20:21.572 --> 20:24.307
- I just--I thought maybe
you'd want to talk more

20:24.375 --> 20:26.276
About all the crazy stuff
going on.

20:26.344 --> 20:27.944
I do. I really do.
Thanks.

20:28.012 --> 20:29.712
Yeah.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.147
I just got to tell you
I'm a little tired.

20:31.215 --> 20:32.315
Okay.

20:32.383 --> 20:35.985
So I may have parked
on your front lawn.

20:36.052 --> 20:37.286
- Oh, you did.
- I did.

20:37.353 --> 20:40.255
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.424
Just come in
before anybody, um...

20:44.922 --> 20:45.922
Leslie and I had
an amazing talk.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.024
It was so great of her
to come over here.

20:48.191 --> 20:50.893
Even though she was exhausted
beyond belief.

20:50.961 --> 20:55.331
Anyway, after we talked,
she fell asleep on my couch.

20:55.399 --> 21:01.203
And she's been asleep
for 22 hours.

21:01.271 --> 21:03.605
It's amazing
what she slept through.

21:04.708 --> 21:07.242
At one point,
I thought she was up...

21:07.310 --> 21:10.412
Hold on. Hi. Hey.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.014
But then she went right back
to sleep.

21:14.050 --> 21:15.551
I've been monitoring
her vital signs.

21:15.619 --> 21:16.719
She's totally fine.

21:16.787 --> 21:19.655
I love her so much.

21:19.723 --> 21:22.058
But I think I'm gonna draw
a mustache on her face.
