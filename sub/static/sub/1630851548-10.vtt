03:34.900 --> 03:38.533
HAS TIES TO HILLARY.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.366
AND COULD BE TRANSPORTING

YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.800
HASN'T HAD ONE YET, HE WOULDN'T

04:10.866 --> 04:11.733
HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND HE

04:11.800 --> 04:14.933
DID AND OF COURSE THEY TALK

04:15.000 --> 04:16.533
THEMSELVES UP THERE ON FOX NEWS,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.100
THE IDEA THAT BIDEN IS

04:18.166 --> 04:19.500
COMPLETELY SENILE LIKE HE CAN'T

04:19.566 --> 04:21.033
GET THROUGH A SENTENCE WITHOUT

04:21.100 --> 04:22.033
FORGETTING WHAT COUNTRY THIS IS

04:22.100 --> 04:31.333
OR ANY MINUTE HE'S GOING TO PEE

04:33.633 --> 04:36.700

04:36.766 --> 04:39.333
THE RIGHT NOTE, FORCEFUL WITHOUT

04:39.400 --> 04:43.133
ASKING ANYONE TO STEP OUTSIDE.

07:20.366 --> 07:23.600
>> IT'S A BIG MISSION.

07:23.666 --> 07:26.333

07:26.400 --> 07:28.500
TYPICALLY IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS

07:28.566 --> 07:29.433
WAS CHECKED TWITTER AND SEE WHAT

07:29.500 --> 07:32.733
THE FORMER GUY TWEETED ABOUT AND

07:32.800 --> 07:34.333
HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT MY DAY.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.566
>> Bill: IS THAT RIGHT?

07:36.633 --> 07:38.533
THAT WAS THE BIG ISSUE.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.033
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A TWEET

07:40.100 --> 07:41.466
AND SOMETHING WHERE YOU WERE

07:41.533 --> 07:43.666
LIKE OH, FUCK, LOOK WHAT HE SAID

07:43.733 --> 07:46.133
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO

07:46.200 --> 07:46.400
SOMETHING.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.200
>> TYPICALLY, THE LAST YEAR AND

07:49.266 --> 07:49.833
THAT 2020 ELECTION, THE RIGGED

07:49.900 --> 07:54.633
ELECTION, THAT WOULD CAUSE

07:54.700 --> 07:56.933
ACROSS A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS AND

07:57.000 --> 07:57.533
ELECTION OFFICIALS, A LOT OF

07:57.600 --> 07:58.266
CONSTERNATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE

07:58.333 --> 08:01.300
TO GET THE MESSAGING STRAIGHT.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.066
AT SOME GUIDANCE OUT AND PRIOR

08:03.133 --> 08:06.533
TO THAT, IT WAS A LOT OF RUSSIA.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.266
>> Bill: AND THEN TRUMP FIRED

08:08.333 --> 08:09.600
YOU, THAT'S HOW I CAME TO KNOW

08:09.666 --> 08:10.166
YOU.

08:10.233 --> 08:12.666
THAT'S HOW WE COME TO KNOW

08:12.733 --> 08:13.866
PEOPLE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

08:13.933 --> 08:15.500
FIRED YOU BY TWEET OF COURSE.

08:15.566 --> 08:16.233
THAT DAY WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING

08:16.300 --> 08:19.500
AT THE TWEETS -- IT GOT VERY

08:19.566 --> 08:23.100
PERSONAL THAT DAY.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.366
>> YEAH, THAT WAS AT THE END OF

08:24.433 --> 08:29.533
THE DAY, 6:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.500
>> Bill: NOT THAT YOU CARE,

08:31.566 --> 08:32.933
NOT THAT IT HURT.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.866
>> I HAD JUST WALKED IN THE DOOR

08:35.933 --> 08:37.433
AND I HAD THOUGHT I HAD MAYBE

08:37.500 --> 08:38.266
GOTTEN THROUGH THE WORST OF IT

08:38.333 --> 08:39.400
AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO STICK

08:39.466 --> 08:42.533
AROUND FOR TRANSITION AND I GET

08:42.600 --> 08:44.533
A TEXT FROM A BUDDY THAT SAYS --

08:44.600 --> 08:45.533
>> Bill: JUST TO PUT IT IN

08:45.600 --> 08:46.500
PERSPECTIVE THIS IS AFTER THE

08:46.566 --> 08:47.866
ELECTION WHEN TRUMP WAS SAYING

08:47.933 --> 08:49.700
THE THING WAS RIGGED AND THIS

08:49.766 --> 08:51.233
WAS THREE WEEKS AFTER THE

08:51.300 --> 08:51.500
ELECTION?

08:51.566 --> 08:52.933
>> TWO WEEKS TO THE DAY.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.366
>> Bill: WE KNOW WHO WON BY

08:54.433 --> 08:56.733
THEN BUT HE WAS STILL RANTING

08:56.800 --> 08:59.200
AND RAVING AT YOU CAME OUT AND

08:59.266 --> 09:02.933
SAID "MY MEMORY OF IT WAS I

09:03.000 --> 09:05.300
LOOKED AT THIS, I'M THE EXPERT,

09:05.366 --> 09:06.866
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT CHEATED,

09:06.933 --> 09:07.833
IT'S THE CLEANEST ELECTION WE

09:07.900 --> 09:10.400
HAVE EVER HAD AND THIS IS ALL

09:10.466 --> 09:10.666
BULLSHIT."

09:10.733 --> 09:13.466

09:13.533 --> 09:15.100
BUT YOU DIDN'T BEND THE KNEE,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.300
GOOD FOR YOU, THAT'S WHY WE LIKE

09:25.800 --> 09:26.400
AND YOU'RE HAPPIER WITH YOUR

09:26.466 --> 09:29.666
DECISION THAN EVER, I'M GUESSIN

09:29.733 --> 09:30.500
GUESSING?

09:30.566 --> 09:32.433
>> I NEVER THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT

09:32.500 --> 09:33.433
IT.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.400
THIS IS PUTTING COUNTRY OVER

09:36.466 --> 09:37.633
PARTY.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.466
[APPLAUSE]

09:41.533 --> 09:44.900
ULTIMATELY, I THINK IT WORKED

09:44.966 --> 09:49.166
OUT FOR ME, THERE WAS SOME ROUGH

09:49.233 --> 09:50.433
PATCHES IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.600
>> Bill: YOU'RE ON TV NOW!

09:51.666 --> 09:55.700
AND HE'S NOT EVEN ON TWITTER!

09:55.766 --> 09:55.966
[LAUGHTER]

09:56.033 --> 09:58.500
YOU WON THIS ONE.

09:58.566 --> 10:01.733
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
ON.

10:02.866 --> 10:04.366
WHAT I KEEP READING IS THE

10:04.433 --> 10:05.900
LARGEST CYBER ATTACK EVER

10:05.966 --> 10:08.100
HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR,

10:08.166 --> 10:08.833
RIGHT?

10:08.900 --> 10:09.533
>> WHICH ONE?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.600
>> Bill: THE ONE THAT WENT ON

10:11.666 --> 10:13.066
FOR EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS?

10:13.133 --> 10:17.033
>> THERE MIGHT BE TWO OR MORE.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.366
>> Bill: THERE IS ONE THAT

10:18.433 --> 10:19.866
WE'VE ALL BEEN READING ABOUT, IT

10:19.933 --> 10:21.500
GOT INTO EVERY DEPARTMENT, FOR

10:21.566 --> 10:22.900
MONTHS AND MONTHS, I GUESS THEY

10:22.966 --> 10:24.166
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

10:24.233 --> 10:27.700
>> THAT WAS THE RUSSIANS AGAIN.

10:27.766 --> 10:28.433
>> Bill: TRUMP SAID CHINA BUT

10:28.500 --> 10:31.000
EVERYONE ELSE SAID RUSSIA,

10:31.066 --> 10:33.500
YOU'RE SURE IT'S RUSSIA.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.100
>> IT'S GOT ALL THE HALLMARKS OF

10:36.166 --> 10:36.833
A RUSSIAN ESPIONAGE OPERATION.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.700
>> Bill: WE KEEP HAVING THESE

10:38.766 --> 10:40.233
THINGS HAPPEN WITH RUSSIA, WHAT

10:40.300 --> 10:42.300
IS THE APPROPRIATE, IN YOUR

10:42.366 --> 10:43.200
VIEW, RESPONSE -- WE DON'T WANT

10:43.266 --> 10:44.233
TO BLOW EACH OTHER UP OVER THIS

10:44.300 --> 10:46.400
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE NOT

10:46.466 --> 10:49.633
DOING ANYTHING.

10:49.700 --> 10:53.200
>> WE ARE, THE HEAD OF CYBER

10:53.266 --> 10:55.066
COMMAND AND THE NSA AND THE

10:55.133 --> 10:56.700
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TALKED

10:56.766 --> 10:57.433
ABOUT SOME OF THE OPERATIONS

10:57.500 --> 11:00.300
THEY RAN AHEAD OF THE ELECTION,

11:00.366 --> 11:02.933
I LOOK AT THIS SPECIFIC ONE, THE

11:03.000 --> 11:05.033
SUNBURST HACK AFFILIATED WITH

11:05.100 --> 11:10.133
SOLAR WINDS, THERE WAS DEGREE OF

11:10.200 --> 11:10.933
RESTRAINT WITH IT.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.466
IF WE THINK BACK TO 2017 WHEN I

11:13.533 --> 11:16.433
JUST STARTED MY OLD JOB, THERE

11:16.500 --> 11:18.800
IS SOMETHING CALLED BAD RABBITS,

11:18.866 --> 11:24.300
ALL REALLY WONKY NAMES AND 2017

11:24.366 --> 11:26.466
WAS PROBABLY THE YEAR OF THE

11:26.533 --> 11:27.733
GREAT HACKS.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.566
THESE EVENTS INCLUDING THE MORE

11:29.633 --> 11:31.700
RECENT ONE ATTRIBUTED TO

11:31.766 --> 11:34.533
CHINA -- MAYBE NOT THAT ONE BUT

11:34.600 --> 11:36.300
THE RUSSIAN ONE SHOW SOME

11:36.366 --> 11:37.066
RESTRAINT, MAYBE THEY'VE

11:37.133 --> 11:39.033
LEARNED, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

11:39.100 --> 11:40.500
BUT CYBER IS THE NEW NORMAL.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.566
>> Bill: LET'S GO BACK TO THE

11:41.633 --> 11:45.100
PART ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING?

11:45.166 --> 11:47.966
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION FOR

11:48.033 --> 11:48.400
SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:48.466 --> 11:50.033
>> Bill: A GREAT QUESTION FOR

11:50.100 --> 11:50.366
SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:50.433 --> 11:54.266
>> GO ASK JOE.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.166
>> Bill: IS IT OFFENSIVE?

11:55.233 --> 11:57.666
IT SEEMS LIKE DEFENSE CAN ONLY

11:57.733 --> 11:58.566
DO SO MUCH.

11:58.633 --> 11:59.966
I KNOW WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE,

12:00.033 --> 12:03.100
WE'VE DONE IT TO IRAN.

12:03.166 --> 12:07.933
>> THERE WAS A MEETING LAST WEEK

12:08.000 --> 12:09.633
BETWEEN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

12:09.700 --> 12:10.200
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE,

12:10.266 --> 12:12.633
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND

12:12.700 --> 12:13.633
THE CHINESE HAD A LINE ABOUT HOW

12:13.700 --> 12:17.433
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.700
I TEND TO THINK FROM THE CYBER

12:18.766 --> 12:25.366
PERSPECTIVE THAT THE U.S. IS THE

12:25.433 --> 12:26.566
BEST.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.966
BUT WE LIVE IN THE GLASS EAST OF

12:30.033 --> 12:30.666
HOUSES WHICH MAKES THINGS A

12:30.733 --> 12:33.833
LITTLE CHALLENGING.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.766
>> Bill: JUST WITHIN CYBER OR

12:35.833 --> 12:36.466
WITHIN EVERYTHING?

12:36.533 --> 12:37.866
>> IS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, THE

12:37.933 --> 12:41.266
WAY EVERYTHING WE DO, NOW,

12:41.333 --> 12:43.000
SCHOOL, BUSINESS, GOVERNMENTS,

12:43.066 --> 12:44.866
EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON THE

12:44.933 --> 12:45.566
INTERNET.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.066
WE ARE INCREDIBLY DEPENDENT ON

12:47.133 --> 12:47.700
THE INTERNET AND THAT MAKES FOR

12:47.766 --> 12:53.366
A LOT OF THINGS WITH THE BAD

12:53.433 --> 12:53.566
GUYS.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.200
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT BITCOIN?

12:55.266 --> 12:58.600
WHAT YOU SEE THAT GOING?

12:58.666 --> 13:01.100
THAT'S SORT OF IN YOUR AREA, I

13:01.166 --> 13:01.900
SEE IT BRINGING DOWN

13:01.966 --> 13:02.766
CIVILIZATION BUT MAYBE --

13:02.833 --> 13:05.866
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ANGLE OF

13:05.933 --> 13:09.833
BITCOIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY BUT

13:09.900 --> 13:11.766
CRYPTOCURRENCY AS I SEE IT AS

13:11.833 --> 13:13.000
ONE OF THE SINGLE ENABLING

13:13.066 --> 13:14.966
FACTORS THAT HAS ALLOWED CYBER

13:15.033 --> 13:18.700
CRIMINALS TO DEPLOY A MASSIVE

13:18.766 --> 13:20.433
AMOUNT OF LAND SOMEWHERE.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.600
THE ANONYMOUS PAYMENTS, THE

13:22.666 --> 13:23.600
ABILITY TO PAY ANONYMOUSLY AND

13:23.666 --> 13:25.500
THAT IS THE CYBER THREAT THAT

13:25.566 --> 13:27.800
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS MOST

13:27.866 --> 13:29.766
CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY

13:29.833 --> 13:30.566
FEEL IT AT HOME.

13:30.633 --> 13:31.133
ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF BUT

13:31.200 --> 13:34.033
RUSSIA AND CHINA, THAT'S

13:34.100 --> 13:34.533
EPHEMERAL.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.800
>> Bill: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

13:36.866 --> 13:38.766
SCHOOLS, 1600 SCHOOLS WERE HIT

13:38.833 --> 13:39.000
LAST YEAR.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.100
>> HOSPITALS AND GOVERNMENT

13:41.166 --> 13:43.733
AGENCIES, BALTIMORE GOT HIT

13:43.800 --> 13:45.700
TWICE, ATLANTA,

13:45.766 --> 13:46.100
MECKLENBURG COUNTY

13:46.166 --> 13:48.166
NORTH CAROLINA, 23 COUNTIES IN

13:48.233 --> 13:48.633
TEXAS.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.400
LOUISIANA HAS BEEN HIT A COUPLE

13:50.466 --> 13:50.600
TIMES.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.700
>> Bill: AND THEY JUST WANT

13:53.766 --> 13:55.600
MONEY, THIS IS NOT ANYTHING

13:55.666 --> 13:57.600
SOPHISTICATED, THIS IS NOT

13:57.666 --> 13:59.433
IDEOLOGICAL IT'S LIKE AT THE END

13:59.500 --> 14:01.166
OF DIE-HARD WHEN HE FINDS OUT

14:01.233 --> 14:01.800
THEY'RE NOT TERRORISTS, THEY'RE

14:01.866 --> 14:04.100
JUST ROBBERS.

14:04.166 --> 14:10.466
>> IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.833
IF THERE IS A VULNERABILITY,

14:12.900 --> 14:15.666
EXPLOIT, MONEY OR INFORMATION TO

14:15.733 --> 14:16.133
BE HAD NO MEANINGFUL

14:16.200 --> 14:17.300
CONSEQUENCES, THE BAD GUYS ARE

14:17.366 --> 14:20.233
GOING TO RUN WILD SO WE HAVE TO

14:20.300 --> 14:20.733
CHANGE THAT EQUATION.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.466
LOOKING AT CRYPTOCURRENCY, WE

14:23.533 --> 14:25.500
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT.

14:25.566 --> 14:26.600
WE NEED TO START HOLDING SOME OF

14:26.666 --> 14:28.233
THESE COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA THAT

14:28.300 --> 14:30.366
ALLOW THESE CYBER CRIMINALS TO

14:30.433 --> 14:31.066
OPERATE IN THEIR SOVEREIGN

14:31.133 --> 14:31.766
TERRITORY WITH IMPUNITY, WE NEED

14:31.833 --> 14:34.633
TO FOCUS ON THAT.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.433
YOU GET BACK HOME, WE HAVE TO

14:36.500 --> 14:39.766
HELP STATE AND LOCALS TO IMPROVE

14:39.833 --> 14:41.066
THEIR DEFENSES AND I FEAR IT'S

14:41.133 --> 14:44.533
ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE

14:44.600 --> 14:45.733
OF THE WAY TAX REVENUES AT THE

14:45.800 --> 14:47.000
STATE LEVEL HAVE TAKEN A REAL

14:47.066 --> 14:49.066
HIT BECAUSE OF COVID.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.100
I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

14:51.166 --> 14:52.866
INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENTS,

14:52.933 --> 14:54.700
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A 21ST CENTURY

18:09.300 --> 18:12.033
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EVEN

18:12.100 --> 18:12.633
KNOWS WHAT THE WORD

18:12.700 --> 18:13.100
INFRASTRUCTURE MEANS.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.266
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.400
SKIP THAT PART, GO ON.

18:18.466 --> 18:20.300
>> Bill: YES YOU DO, WHAT IT

18:20.366 --> 18:21.133
REALLY MEANS IS ROADS AND

18:21.200 --> 18:23.400
BRIDGES AND PORTS IN THE

18:23.466 --> 18:24.900
ELECTRICAL GRID.

18:24.966 --> 18:25.900
HE'S BEING VERY GENEROUS WITH

18:25.966 --> 18:28.300
THE DEFINITION AND IT'S A CHILD

18:28.366 --> 18:28.933
LEARNING, HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.666
YOU CAN CALL ANYTHING

18:31.733 --> 18:32.600
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE WIN

18:32.666 --> 18:34.300
ARGUMENTS THESE DAYS BY CHANGING

18:34.366 --> 18:37.700
THE MEANING OF WORDS.

18:37.766 --> 18:38.666
SILENCE AND VIOLENCE?

18:38.733 --> 18:41.033
I THOUGHT VIOLENCE WAS WHEN IT

18:41.100 --> 18:42.933
HURT.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.100
FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WISH WE

18:45.166 --> 18:47.500
HAD MORE CONFETTI, 51% OF

18:47.566 --> 18:50.666
REPUBLICANS BOTH SUPPORT

18:50.733 --> 18:54.466
GAY MARRIAGE AND LEGALIZING POT.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.200
WE'VE GONE OVER THE 50% MARK

18:56.266 --> 19:01.100
WITH REPUBLICANS.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.166
SO WHY COULDN'T CARBON BE NEXT?

19:04.233 --> 19:06.466
NO?

19:06.533 --> 19:08.766
>> SURE, BY ALL MEANS, THEY

19:08.833 --> 19:10.033
SHOULD DO THAT IN ONE OF THE

19:10.100 --> 19:12.266
WAYS OF DOING IT AS BEING

19:12.333 --> 19:12.866
SERIOUS ABOUT CARBON SOLUTIONS

19:12.933 --> 19:16.700
LIKE SUPPORTING NUCLEAR ENERGY.

19:16.766 --> 19:17.900
THAT GOT A BIG CHEER.

19:17.966 --> 19:19.566
[LAUGHTER]

19:19.633 --> 19:21.600
>> Bill: BIDEN AT HIS PRESS

19:21.666 --> 19:22.500
CONFERENCE, THERE WAS NO

19:22.566 --> 19:23.866
QUESTIONS IN AN HOUR ABOUT THE

19:23.933 --> 19:27.600
PANDEMIC, THE VACCINE PROGRAM,

19:27.666 --> 19:29.500
OR THE $1.9 TRILLION RELIEF PLAN

19:29.566 --> 19:32.066
HE JUST PASSED.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.133
YOU ARE PRESS PEOPLE, WHAT DO

19:34.200 --> 19:35.000
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

19:35.066 --> 19:38.100
>> I THINK THE PRESS IS ALL IN.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.066
>> Bill: MEANING?

19:40.133 --> 19:42.000
>> I THINK HE'S NOT GETTING

19:42.066 --> 19:43.800
PRESSED SO TO SPEAK ON A LOT OF

19:43.866 --> 19:44.700
THE TOUGH ISSUES RIGHT NOW AND I

19:44.766 --> 19:48.366
HAVE TO SAY AS SOMEBODY WHO IS

19:48.433 --> 19:50.300
IN THE MEDIA BUT ISN'T REALLY A

19:50.366 --> 19:51.000
JOURNALIST, I THINK PEOPLE ARE

19:51.066 --> 19:53.433
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.233
RIGHT NOW, I THINK HATING

19:55.300 --> 19:55.966
AMERICA IS NO LONGER A LUXURY

19:56.033 --> 19:59.233
THAT WE CAN AFFORD.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.933
WHEN YOU AND I WERE YOUNG, I

20:01.000 --> 20:03.133
GREW UP IN BERKELEY, MY PARENTS

20:03.200 --> 20:04.233
WERE SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF

20:04.300 --> 20:06.933
KARL MARX, I KNEW AMERICA WAS A

20:07.000 --> 20:08.133
WAR MACHINE, IMPERIALIST POWER

20:08.200 --> 20:09.566
AND MY PARENTS WERE HELPING KIDS

20:09.633 --> 20:11.300
DODGE THE DRAFT AND GET TO

20:11.366 --> 20:13.466
CANADA AND YOU CAN HAVE OPINIONS

20:13.533 --> 20:14.566
LIKE THAT WHEN THE REST OF THE

20:14.633 --> 20:16.466
COUNTRY IS HOLDING UP AMERICA

20:16.533 --> 20:19.033
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE EVEN LIVING

20:19.100 --> 20:21.666
AMERICA.

20:21.733 --> 20:23.133
RIGHT NOW EVERYWHERE YOU TURN

20:23.200 --> 20:25.800
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE BREAK INTO THE

20:25.866 --> 20:26.866
CAPITOL BUILDING IN SHIT ON THE

20:26.933 --> 20:27.100
FLOOR.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.233
>> Bill: IN THE NAME OF LOVING

20:29.300 --> 20:29.766
AMERICA.

20:29.833 --> 20:30.933
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY HATES

20:31.000 --> 20:32.533
AMERICA, THEY JUST HATE THE

20:32.600 --> 20:34.666
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE OTHER

20:34.733 --> 20:35.466
SIDE.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.700
THEY DID A SURVEY RECENTLY IN

20:36.766 --> 20:37.733
THE ASKED PEOPLE WHAT IS THE

20:37.800 --> 20:40.633
MOST PRESSING PROBLEM -- BY FAR,

20:40.700 --> 20:42.233
THE WINNER WAS OTHER PEOPLE IN

20:42.300 --> 20:42.466
AMERICA.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.533
I'M NOT KIDDING.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.266
54%, THE OTHERS.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.233
PEOPLE I DON'T AGREE WITH,

20:51.300 --> 20:51.866
THAT'S AMERICA.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.433
>> THE PRESS NEEDS TO HOLD THE

20:53.500 --> 20:54.566
ADMINISTRATION TO ACCOUNT IN A

20:54.633 --> 20:55.733
NORMAL WAY BUT ON THE OTHER

20:55.800 --> 20:58.633
HAND, WE JUST WENT THROUGH FOUR

20:58.700 --> 21:00.066
YEARS IN WHICH THE PRESIDENCY

21:00.133 --> 21:03.000
WAS A JACK HAMMER OUTSIDE YOUR

21:03.066 --> 21:07.900
WINDOW AT 6:00 A.M. EVERY SINGLE

21:08.000 --> 21:10.066
DAY.

21:10.133 --> 21:10.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:10.966 --> 21:12.800
I THINK A RESPITE IS A PRETTY

21:12.866 --> 21:13.100
GOOD THING.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.866
>> Bill: THAT'S A GOOD

21:14.933 --> 21:15.100
ANALOGY.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.366
I WAS WATCHING DR. ROBERT

21:17.433 --> 21:19.700
REDFORD -- NO, I KNEW I WAS

21:19.766 --> 21:20.833
GOING TO, DR. ROBERT REDFIELD,

21:20.900 --> 21:22.500
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CDC.

21:22.566 --> 21:23.266
HE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS

21:23.333 --> 21:24.966
INTERESTING OR AT LEAST IT MADE

21:25.033 --> 21:25.900
NEWS THAT HE THINKS CORONAVIRUS

21:25.966 --> 21:29.200
CAME FROM THE LAB WHICH HAS BEEN

21:29.266 --> 21:32.633
TALKED ABOUT SINCE IT BEGAN.

21:32.700 --> 21:33.233
BUT IN THIS BINARY WAY WE LIVE

21:33.300 --> 21:36.433
IN THE COUNTRY, IT'S LIKE IF

21:36.500 --> 21:40.633
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, IT'S A BAT.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.300
IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN, IT'S A

21:42.366 --> 21:44.533
LAB AND IT'S SO FUCKING STUPID

21:44.600 --> 21:46.133
BECAUSE THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC

21:46.200 --> 21:47.133
ISSUE, IT TOTALLY COULD HAVE

21:47.200 --> 21:49.100
BEEN A LAB.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.733
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO US THAT

21:51.800 --> 21:52.933
EVERYBODY BEHAVES THIS WAY?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.733
AND THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO

21:54.800 --> 21:56.133
BELIEVE IN Q1 NINE?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.300
WHEN WE GREW UP, I KNOW YOU ARE

21:58.366 --> 22:00.033
MUCH YOUNGER BUT IT WASN'T LIKE

22:00.100 --> 22:00.466
THIS.

22:00.533 --> 22:02.133
WE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT WE

22:02.200 --> 22:03.533
DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE THINKING

22:03.600 --> 22:05.566
THERE WERE A CHILD MOLESTERS IN

22:05.633 --> 22:08.666
THE SUEZ CANAL THAT HILLARY SENT

22:08.733 --> 22:08.866
THERE.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.533
>> Bill: NOT EVERYTHING BECAME

22:10.600 --> 22:11.666
A POLARIZING ISSUE.

22:11.733 --> 22:13.800
>> AND WE'VE TRAINED -- I THINK

22:13.866 --> 22:15.033
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE HAVE

22:15.100 --> 22:17.600
TRAINED PEOPLE TO TURN OFF THEIR

22:17.666 --> 22:18.666
BRAINS.

22:18.733 --> 22:21.966
THE DEFAULT IS DON'T THINK, JOIN

22:22.033 --> 22:22.766
A GROUP AND ADOPT WHATEVER THE

22:22.833 --> 22:26.533
PREVAILING VIEW IS OF THAT

22:26.600 --> 22:27.500
GROUP.

22:27.566 --> 22:28.300
IT'S POSSIBLE TO HOLD

22:28.366 --> 22:29.633
CONSERVATIVE VIEWS AND STILL

22:29.700 --> 22:33.733
THINK DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST

22:33.800 --> 22:35.900
PRESIDENT AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.

22:35.966 --> 22:36.366
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

22:36.433 --> 22:37.400
>> Bill: AS MANY HAVE.

22:37.466 --> 22:38.833
>> IT REQUIRES A LEVEL OF

22:38.900 --> 22:40.266
INDEPENDENT THINKING, IT IS

22:40.333 --> 22:40.933
POSSIBLE TO THINK THAT MAYBE

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
THIS CAME FROM A LAB BUT AT THE

22:43.066 --> 22:44.233
END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T MATTER

22:44.300 --> 22:45.733
BECAUSE WE HAVE A GLOBAL

22:45.800 --> 22:47.600
PANDEMIC WE JUST HAVE TO SOLVE.

22:47.666 --> 22:51.266
>> Bill: IT DOES MATTER

22:51.333 --> 22:52.466
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS HOW WE

22:52.533 --> 22:52.966
UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.666
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS HE THINKS IT

22:55.733 --> 22:57.066
CAME FROM A LAB BECAUSE IT ACTED

22:57.133 --> 22:58.966
IN WAYS IT WOULDN'T IF IT CAME

22:59.033 --> 23:00.866
FROM NATURE, THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

23:00.933 --> 23:03.466
IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO SAY THAT'S

23:03.533 --> 23:05.666
A REPUBLICAN POINT -- LIKE

23:05.733 --> 23:06.466
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE IS A

23:06.533 --> 23:07.700
REPUBLICAN, I WOULDN'T TAKE IT

23:07.766 --> 23:08.300
BUT WHO KNOWS?

23:08.366 --> 23:10.733
THEY USE IT IN SOME COUNTRIES,

23:10.800 --> 23:11.833
IT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE IT'S NOT

23:11.900 --> 23:13.866
LIKE TRUMP TOOK IT, I WOULDN'T

23:13.933 --> 23:18.866
TAKE IT IF IT SAVED MY LIFE.

23:18.933 --> 23:20.600
>> IT WAS VETTED AROUND BEFORE

23:20.666 --> 23:21.833
HE TOOK IT, IT WAS KNOWN AND

23:21.900 --> 23:23.933
SEEN AS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT

23:24.000 --> 23:28.333
WORK A BIT AND IT HAS.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.300
>> Bill: I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

23:30.366 --> 23:31.300
THE SHOOTING BECAUSE FUCKING

23:31.366 --> 23:32.333
GUNS, EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS AND

23:32.400 --> 23:34.533
IT MAKES YOU SICK THAT THIS IS

23:34.600 --> 23:36.000
AMERICA, WE ARE THE GUN COUNTRY

23:36.066 --> 23:40.933
THAT WE KEEP SHOOTING EACH OTHE

23:41.000 --> 23:43.366
OTHER.

23:43.433 --> 23:45.533
MY QUESTION TODAY IS WHAT IS THE

23:45.600 --> 23:47.433
LAW THAT STOPS THIS.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.966
TED CRUZ SAYS EVERY TIME THERE'S

23:49.033 --> 23:50.500
A SHOOTING WE PLAY THIS

23:50.566 --> 23:51.800
RIDICULOUS THEATER WHERE THIS

23:51.866 --> 23:52.766
COMMITTEE GETS TOGETHER AND

23:52.833 --> 23:53.666
PROPOSES A BUNCH OF LAWS THAT

23:53.733 --> 23:56.133
WOULD DO NOTHING TO STOP THESE

23:56.200 --> 24:00.933
MURDERS.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.300
THEY SAID BOTH OF THESE GUYS GOT

24:02.366 --> 24:06.500
THE GUNS LEGALLY.

24:06.566 --> 24:09.666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING

24:09.733 --> 24:09.900
ABOUT.

24:09.966 --> 24:14.266
WHAT LAW WOULD CHANGE IT?

24:14.333 --> 24:15.866
HE'S SAYING IT WOULD DO NOTHING

24:15.933 --> 24:18.633
TO STOP THESE MURDERS, MOST

24:18.700 --> 24:20.133
PEOPLE ARE FOR THESE THINGS,

24:20.200 --> 24:25.033
LET'S TRY IT AND IF IT DOESN'T,

24:25.100 --> 24:25.800
THEN WILL NECK KNOW.

24:25.866 --> 24:27.866
>> THE ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT

24:27.933 --> 24:29.333
THESE MEN WHO DO THESE MASS

24:29.400 --> 24:30.933
SHOOTING INCIDENTS, WE KNOW A

24:31.000 --> 24:33.533
FEW THINGS ABOUT THEM BUT ONE OF

24:33.600 --> 24:35.166
THE MAIN COMMONALITIES IS

24:35.233 --> 24:35.933
PROFOUND CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND

24:36.000 --> 24:38.866
DEEP MENTAL ILLNESS.

24:38.933 --> 24:40.533
BACKGROUND CHECK THAT INVOLVED

24:40.600 --> 24:41.333
MENTAL ILLNESS, I THINK THAT

24:41.400 --> 24:42.866
WOULD COME UP AND WE WOULD HAVE

24:42.933 --> 24:44.666
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SCREEN OUT

24:44.733 --> 24:46.066
SOME OF THESE MEN, IT MAKES

24:46.133 --> 24:48.133
SENSE TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE

24:48.200 --> 24:49.000
THAT.

24:49.066 --> 24:50.466
>> IT SHOULD BE HARDER TO GET A

24:50.533 --> 24:52.866
GUN THEN TO GET A DRIVER'S

24:52.933 --> 24:53.800
LICENSE, THAT SHOULD BE BASIC

24:53.866 --> 24:54.133
COMMON SENSE.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.000
THE OTHER THING I WAS THINKING

24:57.066 --> 24:58.233
ABOUT, WHEN I THINK OF MY BIG

24:58.300 --> 25:00.400
SCREW UPS IN LIFE IT'S USUALLY

25:00.466 --> 25:01.733
WHEN I CLICK SEND ON AN EMAIL TO

25:01.800 --> 25:03.933
YOU SOON AND I WISH THERE WAS AN

25:04.000 --> 25:05.466
ALGORITHM THAT WOULD JUST SAY

25:05.533 --> 25:07.000
THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ANGRY EMAIL,

25:07.066 --> 25:09.166
WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS FOR A

25:09.233 --> 25:10.966
FEW HOURS AND IT WOULD'VE SAVED

25:11.033 --> 25:12.333
ME A LOT OF GRIEF IN MY LIFE.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.233
HOW ABOUT THIS LOOKS LIKE YOU

25:14.300 --> 25:20.466
LOOK LIKE YOU ARE PISSED OFF, GO

25:20.533 --> 25:21.066
HOME FOR THREE DAYS AND WE ARE

25:21.133 --> 25:24.100
GOING TO CHECK YOU OUT.

25:24.166 --> 25:24.866
[APPLAUSE]

25:24.933 --> 25:27.300
>> REMEMBER HOMER SIMPSON, THREE

25:27.366 --> 25:29.600
DAY WAITING PERIOD, BUT I'M

25:29.666 --> 25:30.166
ANGRY NOW!

25:30.233 --> 25:31.933
>> Bill: 91% OF PEOPLE SUPPORT

25:32.000 --> 25:37.933
BACKGROUND CHECKS, 89 GUN SALES

25:38.000 --> 25:41.666
TO PEOPLE -- THERE SHOULD BE A

25:41.733 --> 25:43.633
MANDATORY THREE DAY WAITING

25:43.700 --> 25:45.533
PERIOD, THIS INCLUDES MOST

25:45.600 --> 25:46.733
REPUBLICANS AND EVEN NRA

25:46.800 --> 25:47.033
MEMBERS.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.666
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THE LEAST

25:48.733 --> 25:50.066
WE COULD DO, GIVE THAT A TRY,

25:50.133 --> 25:51.933
SEE IF IT CHANGES ANYTHING, IT

25:52.000 --> 25:54.500
MAY NOT BECAUSE AGAIN, YOU SAID

25:54.566 --> 25:56.066
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, I WOULD

25:56.133 --> 26:00.200
PUT THAT IN THE BROADER CATEGORY

26:00.266 --> 26:03.033
OF "CANNOT GET LAID."

26:03.100 --> 26:03.600
[APPLAUSE]

26:03.666 --> 26:05.766
I'M SORRY, BUT ALL OVER THE

26:05.833 --> 26:07.866
WORLD WHETHER IT'S ISIS OR IN

26:07.933 --> 26:14.700
CELLS, IT'S JUST THE THEME.

26:14.766 --> 26:16.766
#NeedAGirlfriend WAS ON HIS

26:16.833 --> 26:18.500
FACEBOOK PAGE, THIS IS THE NAME

26:18.566 --> 26:18.833
OF THE MOVIE.

26:18.900 --> 26:22.033
I'M GOING TO OPEN A CHAIN OF

26:22.100 --> 26:22.766
GAME SCHOOLS AND TEACH MEN HOW

26:22.833 --> 26:25.200
TO HAVE A LITTLE GAME BECAUSE

26:25.266 --> 26:27.566
IT'S NOT LIKE GIRLS AREN'T OUT

26:27.633 --> 26:29.200
THERE.

26:29.266 --> 26:31.066
WE NEED TO TEACH GAME IN THE

26:31.133 --> 26:31.366
CURRICULUM.

26:31.433 --> 26:37.500
>> DID YOU SEE HIS PICTURE?

26:37.566 --> 26:38.033
>> Bill: NO.

26:38.100 --> 26:38.933
>> HE NEEDS A LOT OF TUTORING

26:39.000 --> 26:42.666
FROM YOU, THE NEXT TIME HE GOES

26:42.733 --> 26:42.966
OUT.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.433
>> Bill: IS NOT HOW YOU LOOK,

26:45.500 --> 26:46.100
RIGHT?

26:46.166 --> 26:46.933
IT'S NOT.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.466
WOMEN ARE DEEPER THAN US, LOTS

26:48.533 --> 26:50.933
OF MEN WHO ARE NOT THAT GREAT

26:51.000 --> 26:52.566
LOOKING DO VERY WELL.

26:52.633 --> 26:53.966
I DON'T WANT TO NAME NAMES.

26:56.733 --> 27:00.266
HE HAS DEEP, DEEP MENTAL ILLNESS

27:00.333 --> 27:01.500
BECAUSE IT'S SO CONSISTENT WITH

27:01.566 --> 27:03.633
THESE MEN.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.700
>> PART OF THE CON ON THE RIGHT

27:05.766 --> 27:07.366
AS THEY SAY WHAT WE REALLY HAVE

27:07.433 --> 27:09.666
IS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, WE

27:09.733 --> 27:11.100
SHOULD INVEST IN MENTAL HEALTH.

27:11.166 --> 27:12.133
ALL COUNTRIES HAVE PEOPLE WITH

27:12.200 --> 27:13.900
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, IT'S

27:13.966 --> 27:16.500
THAT THEY DON'T IMMEDIATE HAVE

27:16.566 --> 27:17.033
ACCESS TO WEAPONS OF MASS

27:17.100 --> 27:17.333
DESTRUCTION.

27:17.400 --> 27:22.633
[APPLAUSE]

27:22.700 --> 27:24.133

27:24.200 --> 27:26.433
COUNTRY THAT HAS MORE GUNS THAN

27:26.500 --> 27:27.666
PEOPLE, THESE GUYS WHO BOUGHT

27:27.733 --> 27:32.233
THESE GUNS ILLEGAL AND ONE OF

27:32.300 --> 27:32.866
THEM WASN'T AN ASSAULT RIFLE,

27:32.933 --> 27:34.900
YOU THINK THAT WOULD CHANGE

27:34.966 --> 27:35.166
ANYTHING?

27:35.233 --> 27:36.833
YOU DON'T THINK THEY WOULD GET

27:36.900 --> 27:37.733
SOME WEAPON?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.100
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

27:39.166 --> 27:41.700
HERE, WE ARE PRETENDING THAT

27:41.766 --> 27:42.500
CERTAIN TYPES OF WEAPONS ARE

27:42.566 --> 27:45.633
GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.033
THAT NEEDS TO BE QUESTIONED.

27:47.100 --> 27:50.600
>> I AGREE, IF IT MANAGES TO

27:50.666 --> 27:51.100
DIMINISH GUN CRIME.

27:51.166 --> 27:52.700
>> Bill: I'M SAYING LET'S TRY

27:52.766 --> 27:52.866
IT.

27:52.933 --> 27:54.866
TO SPEAK OF THE LARGER POINT IS

27:54.933 --> 27:55.600
SOMEONE SHOULD CALL FOR THE

27:55.666 --> 27:58.300
REPEAL OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

27:58.366 --> 27:59.066
AND STILL PEOPLE START THINKING

27:59.133 --> 28:01.233
THAT IT IS CRAZY THAT WE HAVE AN

28:01.300 --> 28:02.133
AMENDMENT THAT WAS WRITTEN AT A

28:02.200 --> 28:03.166
TIME WHEN A SKILLED MARKSMAN

28:03.233 --> 28:04.100
COULD GET OFF MAY BE TWO SHOTS

28:04.166 --> 28:09.033
IN A MINUTE AT BEST, THAT THAT

28:09.100 --> 28:11.800
IS RELEVANT AND WORKS FOR

28:11.866 --> 28:12.133
TODAY'S CRAZY.

28:12.200 --> 28:12.700
>> Bill: JOHN PAUL STEVENS,

28:12.766 --> 28:16.800
REMEMBER HIM?

28:16.866 --> 28:19.000
HE SAID ALL WE NEED TO DO IS ADD

28:19.066 --> 28:20.100
FIVE WORDS TO THE

28:20.166 --> 28:25.066
SECOND AMENDMENT AND IT'S LIKE

28:25.133 --> 28:26.100
IN THE CASE OF BEING IN THE

28:26.166 --> 28:28.600
MILITIA, WE CAN MAKE IT ALIGNED

28:28.666 --> 28:30.166
WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT, AND

28:30.233 --> 28:31.533
THOSE FEW WORDS BUT THAT'S NEVER

28:31.600 --> 28:33.566
GOING TO HAPPEN.

28:33.633 --> 28:34.200
>> MAYBE.

28:34.266 --> 28:36.266
I JUST THINK PEOPLE -- THERE'S

28:36.333 --> 28:39.833
GOING TO BE A POINT THAT WE JUST

28:39.900 --> 28:41.433
CAN'T TOLERATE IT ANYMORE AND

28:41.500 --> 28:42.300
IT'S AMAZING AND SHAMEFUL THAT

28:42.366 --> 28:45.166
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET WHEN

28:45.233 --> 28:47.333
KIDS ARE SHOT DEAD IN THEIR

28:47.400 --> 28:49.500
CLASSROOMS.

28:49.566 --> 28:52.266
IT'S HOPELESSNESS.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.433
>> Bill: I KID FOX NEWS A LOT

28:53.500 --> 28:54.666
ON THIS SHOW AND THE ONLY REASON

28:54.733 --> 28:56.633
I DO IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE

28:56.700 --> 28:58.966
MOSTLY A BUNCH OF OBNOXIOUS

28:59.033 --> 29:00.400
ASSHOLES.

29:00.466 --> 29:05.233
THE ONLY REASON I DO IT --

29:05.300 --> 29:06.666
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

29:06.733 --> 29:09.066
BUT FOX IS STILL THE BRAND,

THEY ARE ALWAYS WE ARE THE

ORGANIZATIONS, THAT IS WHAT IS

29:32.566 --> 29:34.066
BLEEDING AWAY FROM THEM.

29:34.133 --> 29:35.066
SO THEY DECIDED TO STEP IT UP.

32:54.866 --> 32:56.700
THE WORDS "CONGRESS SHALL MAKE

NO LAW," THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

32:59.933 --> 33:01.366

PEOPLE WILL LIE, PEOPLE WILL

33:17.466 --> 33:18.800
SPEAKING OF NOT BE ALLOWED TO

EXIST, YOU WANT TO DO THAT THE

33:19.566 --> 33:23.800

34:11.866 --> 34:13.466

34:13.533 --> 34:15.400
WONDERFUL SCHOOL AND I THINK

34:15.466 --> 34:17.466
SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS DO

34:17.533 --> 34:20.700
EXTRAORDINARY JOBS.

34:20.766 --> 34:21.933

34:43.333 --> 34:43.466
MEDIA.

34:43.533 --> 34:46.533
TELEVISION, GOVERNMENT AND THEY

34:46.600 --> 34:50.833
CONTROL A LOT OF HOW PEOPLE

34:50.900 --> 34:51.600
THINK.

34:51.666 --> 34:52.766
TWO THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT,

34:52.833 --> 34:54.600
PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE BACK OF

34:54.666 --> 34:55.366
THE TEACHERS ANYMORE, THEY

34:55.433 --> 34:57.166
ALWAYS SIDE WITH THEIR LITTLE

34:57.233 --> 34:58.666
BRAT -- THAT IS DIFFERENT AND

34:58.733 --> 35:01.766
THE BIGGEST THING I THINK IS THE

35:01.833 --> 35:03.866
SHIFT AWAY FROM MORAL TEACHING,

35:03.933 --> 35:05.766
FROM THE PARENT TO THE SCHOOL.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.166
IT USED TO BE THE SCHOOL WOULD

35:07.233 --> 35:09.166
BE AFRAID OF WHAT THE PARENT

35:09.233 --> 35:11.966
THOUGHT, AND OTHER PARENT IS

35:12.033 --> 35:13.066
AFRAID OF GOING AGAINST WHAT

35:13.133 --> 35:14.066
THEY ARE TEACHING IN SCHOOL,

35:14.133 --> 35:17.033
EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T AGREE WITH

35:17.100 --> 35:17.800
IT.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.766
THAT IS A HUGE SHIFT WE SHOULD

35:19.833 --> 35:20.666
STOP AND AT LEAST NOTICE AND

35:20.733 --> 35:24.000
DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT.

35:24.066 --> 35:25.000
>> OF COURSE.

35:25.066 --> 35:28.033
IN THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS, THAT'S

35:28.100 --> 35:29.266
NOT SUCH A BIG ISSUE IN THE

35:29.333 --> 35:30.400
SENSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND

35:30.466 --> 35:32.033
YOUR CHILD TO THAT SCHOOL, NO

35:32.100 --> 35:33.166
ONE IS HOLDING A GUN TO YOUR

35:33.233 --> 35:34.700
HEAD AND SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO

35:34.766 --> 35:38.033
TO A FANCY SCHOOL BUT WHEN WE

35:38.100 --> 35:40.166
HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THOUSANDS

35:40.233 --> 35:41.600
OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE PARENTS

35:41.666 --> 35:42.866
ARE AFRAID TO CHALLENGE WHAT'S

35:42.933 --> 35:43.533
GOING ON IN THE CLASSROOM,

35:43.600 --> 35:47.233
THAT'S REALLY A PROBLEM, THAT

35:47.300 --> 35:48.466
THE SERIOUS PROBLEM IN

35:48.533 --> 35:48.733
EDUCATION.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.500
>> I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM

35:50.566 --> 35:52.033
THROUGHOUT EDUCATION, WE ARE

35:52.100 --> 35:53.500
LOSING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

35:53.566 --> 35:55.700
WHAT EDUCATION IS AND WHAT

35:55.766 --> 35:56.100
INDOCTRINATION IS.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.433
A LOT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

35:57.500 --> 36:01.166
REALLY JUST INDOCTRINATION.

36:01.233 --> 36:01.833
[APPLAUSE]

36:01.900 --> 36:04.033
I STUDY MARXISM IN SCHOOL, IT'S

36:04.100 --> 36:04.766
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

36:04.833 --> 36:06.400
MARXISM IS, IT'S DIFFERENT FROM

36:06.466 --> 36:07.733
BEING TAUGHT FROM A MARXIST

36:07.800 --> 36:09.266
PERSPECTIVE.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.833
ONE EXPOSES YOU TO IDEAS, THE

36:10.900 --> 36:13.833
OTHER MAKES YOU A SOLDIER IN A

36:13.900 --> 36:16.100
GIVEN PERSPECTIVE AND THERE'S

36:16.166 --> 36:18.600
SOMETHING KIND OF TOTALITARIAN

36:18.666 --> 36:20.633
ABOUT THAT, YOU'RE PRODUCING NOT

36:20.700 --> 36:22.433
INDEPENDENT THINKERS, YOUR

36:22.500 --> 36:25.933
PRODUCING RED GUARDS.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.166
>> IT'S GROTESQUE AT THE WEALTHY

36:28.233 --> 36:29.633
SCHOOLS, CHILDREN OF

36:29.700 --> 36:31.333
BILLIONAIRES BEING TURNED INTO

36:31.400 --> 36:32.466
BABY MARXISTS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

36:32.533 --> 36:34.433
RICH YOUR DADDY HAS TO BE FOR

36:34.500 --> 36:35.300
MARXISM TO WORK FOR YOU

36:35.366 --> 36:40.433
PERSONALLY AS A THEORY.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.400
[APPLAUSE]

36:41.466 --> 36:42.400
THAT'S ANOTHER AMERICAN ISSUE,

36:42.466 --> 36:43.733
WE'VE GOT TO PULL TOGETHER AND

36:43.800 --> 36:45.666
WE'VE GOT TO LIFT UP THIS WHOLE

36:45.733 --> 36:47.666
IDEA OF EDUCATION AND GET SOME

36:47.733 --> 36:48.833
OF THIS OUT OF THE SCHOOLS, WE

36:48.900 --> 36:52.333
HAVE TO.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.666
>> Bill: I READ IN SOME OF

36:54.733 --> 36:56.666
YOUR ARTICLE AND SOME IN HERS,

36:56.733 --> 36:58.166
THAT THERE IS A CLIMATE OF FEAR

36:58.233 --> 37:00.000
THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN

37:00.066 --> 37:00.566
SCHOOLS.

37:00.633 --> 37:02.533
FEAR OF NOT BEING WOKE ENOUGH,

37:02.600 --> 37:05.033
OF NOT SPEAKING WELCOME ENOUGH.

37:05.100 --> 37:05.900
SHE SAYS POWER IN AMERICA COMES

37:05.966 --> 37:10.600
FROM SPEAKING WOKE.

37:10.666 --> 37:12.566
SHE QUOTES A MATH TEACHER WHO

37:12.633 --> 37:13.800
SAYS I'M IN A CULT -- NOT

37:13.866 --> 37:14.600
EXACTLY IT'S THAT THE CULT IS

37:14.666 --> 37:16.366
ALL AROUND ME AND I'M TRYING TO

37:16.433 --> 37:20.166
SAVE KIDS FROM BECOMING MEMBERS.

37:20.233 --> 37:22.600
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A

37:22.666 --> 37:23.666
SCIENTOLOGY DEFECTOR.

37:23.733 --> 37:26.400
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN A

37:26.466 --> 37:27.400
CERTAIN PERIOD WHICH I THINK

37:27.466 --> 37:28.733
IT'S GOING TO BE SHORT-LIVED AND

37:28.800 --> 37:29.366
THE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN REACTING

37:29.433 --> 37:33.633
VERY QUICKLY AND HUGELY TO THE

37:33.700 --> 37:35.766
SOCIAL PROTESTS OVER THE SUMMER

37:35.833 --> 37:37.266
WHICH KIDS THANK GOD WERE VERY

37:37.333 --> 37:40.833
MOVED BY AND VERY MUCH A PART

37:40.900 --> 37:41.633
OF.

37:41.700 --> 37:42.900
THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT THE LESSONS

37:42.966 --> 37:45.800
THEY ARE INTRODUCING ON THE

37:45.866 --> 37:46.633
BACKS OF THAT PROTESTS ARE

37:46.700 --> 37:47.166
GROTESQUE.

37:47.233 --> 37:49.100
>> THE CLIMATE OF FEAR IS NOT

37:49.166 --> 37:52.366
JUST IN SCHOOLS, IT'S THROUGHOUT

37:52.433 --> 37:53.266
INSTITUTIONS, COMPANIES ALL OVER

37:53.333 --> 37:57.300
THE COUNTRY.

37:57.366 --> 37:57.866
PEOPLE HAVE TO START CALLING

37:57.933 --> 37:59.933
BULLSHIT ON IT.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.333
THE ONLY WAY THIS ENDS IS PEOPLE

38:02.400 --> 38:03.600
IN AUTHORITY SAY WE AREN'T GOING

38:03.666 --> 38:04.833
TO BE BELIEVED IF YOU DON'T WANT

38:04.900 --> 38:07.133
TO WORK HERE, GO ELSEWHERE,

38:07.200 --> 38:07.933
THESE ARE OUR VALUES AND WE ARE

38:08.000 --> 38:10.500
GOING TO STICK BY THEM.

38:10.566 --> 38:11.600
THEY INCLUDE FAIR PLAY AND

38:11.666 --> 38:13.933
OPENNESS TO VARIETY POINTS OF

38:14.000 --> 38:17.333
VIEW.

38:17.400 --> 38:17.733
[APPLAUSE]

38:17.800 --> 38:20.766
>> Bill: THEY SEEM OBSESSED

38:20.833 --> 38:22.433
WITH THE CONCEPT OF PRIVILEGE.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.033
THE ONE YOU TAUGHT AT.

38:25.100 --> 38:28.666
>> HARVARD WESTLAKE.

38:28.733 --> 38:30.133
>> Bill: I'M LOOKING AT THIS

38:30.200 --> 38:31.800
CHART, CAN YOU SHOW THIS CHART

38:31.866 --> 38:33.033
TO PEOPLE?

38:33.100 --> 38:38.366
THE WORLD IS DIVIDED INTO A

38:38.433 --> 38:39.666
OPPRESSION, RESISTANCE,

38:39.733 --> 38:40.200
PRIVILEGE, SOME OF THEM ARE

38:40.266 --> 38:42.566
OUTDATED TO SOME DEGREE.

38:42.633 --> 38:47.766
HETEROSEXUAL, NOT AT THE ABBEY.

38:47.833 --> 38:53.566
GENDER CONFORMING YOUNG ADULT,

38:53.633 --> 38:54.200
OPPRESSION, WORKING CLASS,

38:54.266 --> 38:57.633
PERSON OF COLOR, FEMALE, NOT

38:57.700 --> 39:00.466
EVERYWHERE.

39:00.533 --> 39:02.233
THE WORLD IS SO MUCH MORE

39:02.300 --> 39:02.966
COMPLICATED THAN THIS.

39:03.033 --> 39:04.100
>> THE FIRST THING I WAS TAUGHT

39:04.166 --> 39:05.833
WHEN I WAS TAUGHT HOW TO BE A

39:05.900 --> 39:07.066
TEACHER AT THAT WONDERFUL SCHOOL

39:07.133 --> 39:09.000
WAS NEVER WASTE A STUDENT'S

39:09.066 --> 39:11.633
TIME, THAT'S THE MOST PRECIOUS

39:11.700 --> 39:11.900
RESOURCE.

39:11.966 --> 39:12.833
NEVER TEACH A RIDICULOUS LESSON

39:12.900 --> 39:14.433
AND IF YOU'RE SITTING THERE AT A

39:14.500 --> 39:16.200
SCHOOL THAT COSTS $35,000 A YEAR

39:16.266 --> 39:17.800
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

39:17.866 --> 39:19.400
WHO HAS PRIVILEGE IN AMERICA,

39:19.466 --> 39:21.733
GET A MIRROR.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.100
YOU'RE THE PRIVILEGED ONE, YOU

39:23.166 --> 39:25.400
DON'T HAVE TO SIT HERE WITH THIS

39:25.466 --> 39:27.466
COMPLICATED MAP, IT'S A USELESS

39:27.533 --> 39:27.900
LESSON.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.166
>> Bill: AREN'T WE TALKING

39:29.233 --> 39:31.166
ABOUT ADVANTAGE?

39:31.233 --> 39:36.666
THE WORD PRIVILEGE BOTHERS ME.

39:36.733 --> 39:37.300
THERE ARE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES AND

39:37.366 --> 39:38.866
OF COURSE RACE IS THE BIGGEST

39:38.933 --> 39:40.066
ISSUE IN AMERICA.

39:40.133 --> 39:41.400
I WOULD PUT THAT NUMBER ONE BUT

39:41.466 --> 39:43.000
IT'S ALSO NOT THE ONLY ONE,

39:43.066 --> 39:44.166
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

39:44.233 --> 39:45.833
FACTORS AND THEY ONLY WANT TO

39:45.900 --> 39:47.333
SEE THIS ONE THING.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.566
WHAT IF SOMEONE IS PAINFULLY SHY

39:49.633 --> 39:50.633
LIKE I WAS?

39:50.700 --> 39:52.700
>> YOU WERE PAINFULLY SHY?

39:52.766 --> 39:55.133
>> Bill: ISN'T IT FUNNY?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.733
BUT IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.933
AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE, THE

40:00.000 --> 40:00.733
LIGHT GOES ON.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.033
>> THE ANSWER TO WHETHER YOU ARE

40:04.100 --> 40:04.633
PRIVILEGED OR ADVANTAGED, THE

40:04.700 --> 40:06.666
ANSWER TO IT ISN'T TO FEEL

40:06.733 --> 40:08.066
GUILTY OR ENTER VIRTUE SIGNAL,

40:08.133 --> 40:10.300
IT'S TO DO SOMETHING WITH THOSE

40:10.366 --> 40:10.766
ADVANTAGES.

40:10.833 --> 40:12.566
TRY TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER

40:12.633 --> 40:13.533
PLACE, DON'T FEEL GUILTY FOR

40:13.600 --> 40:14.733
DOING IT.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.000
>> MORE TO THE POINT, IF YOU ARE

40:18.066 --> 40:19.033
TRULY A MARXIST AND I GREW UP IN

40:19.100 --> 40:20.900
A PRETTY LEFT THE HOUSE, TELL

40:20.966 --> 40:22.666
YOUR PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO GO

40:22.733 --> 40:23.766
TO THIS EXPENSIVE SCHOOL

40:23.833 --> 40:24.633
ANYMORE, THIS IS TOO ELITE, I

40:24.700 --> 40:26.900
WANT TO BE PART OF MAKING PUBLIC

40:26.966 --> 40:27.866
SCHOOLS BETTER AND THEY WANT TO

40:27.933 --> 40:30.966
BE SUPER WOKE AND GO TO YALE.

40:31.033 --> 40:31.966
THAT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE TO

40:32.033 --> 40:33.100
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD EITHER

40:33.166 --> 40:34.033
OF THOSE THINGS.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.733
IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT, COME

40:36.800 --> 40:41.066
HERE TO L.A. CITY COLLEGE.

40:41.133 --> 40:44.600
[APPLAUSE]

40:44.666 --> 40:46.300
>> Bill: BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF

40:46.366 --> 40:47.200
TIME, I KNEW YOU WERE COMING

40:47.266 --> 40:50.833
HERE I REALLY WANTED TO GET YOU

40:50.900 --> 40:55.933
ABOUT THE ROYALS.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.100
YOU'RE LAUGHING ALREADY.

40:57.166 --> 40:58.300
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THIS.

40:58.366 --> 41:03.066
>> Bill: BECAUSE NOW THAT

41:03.133 --> 41:03.700
WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO ABSORB IT,

41:03.766 --> 41:06.700
EVERYONE SAW THE OPERA INTERVIEW

41:06.766 --> 41:11.166
WITH HARRY AND MEGHAN, I HAD TO

41:11.233 --> 41:12.166
LAUGH WHEN THEY WERE CANCELING

41:12.233 --> 41:12.800
PEOPLE FOR THE TWEETS THEY WROTE

41:12.866 --> 41:16.866
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE'S A

41:16.933 --> 41:18.200
PICTURE OF HARRY, AMERICA'S NEW

41:18.266 --> 41:21.200
HERO WEARING A SWASTIKA.

41:21.266 --> 41:21.600
I'M JUST SAYING.

41:21.666 --> 41:23.333
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD CANCEL

41:23.400 --> 41:27.200
HIM FOR IT, PEOPLE DO STUPID

41:27.266 --> 41:28.600
THINGS WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG BUT

41:28.666 --> 41:29.733
IT'S AMAZING HOW THE ANGEL OF

41:29.800 --> 41:32.966
DEATH FLIES OVER SOME PEOPLE'S

41:33.033 --> 41:34.700
HOUSES.

41:34.766 --> 41:35.033
IT'S AMAZING.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.533
>> NOT ONLY THAT BUT SHE FELT A

41:37.600 --> 41:39.033
REALLY WORTHWHILE ROLE FOR HER

41:39.100 --> 41:39.966
TO PLAY WAS TO VISIT THE

41:40.033 --> 41:42.600
COUNTRIES OF THE COMMONWEALTH

41:42.666 --> 41:43.966
BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGELY PEOPLE

41:44.033 --> 41:46.533
OF COLOR, WHICH IS TRUE BECAUSE

41:46.600 --> 41:49.000
THEY ARE COLONIZED BY THE STUPID

41:49.066 --> 41:50.200
FAMILY YOU MARRIED INTO AND YOU

41:50.266 --> 41:51.733
SHOULD NOT BE THEIR EMISSARY,

41:51.800 --> 41:53.833
YOU SHOULD BE GOING THERE AND

41:53.900 --> 41:55.366
TELLING THEM BREAK FREE AND

41:55.433 --> 42:00.566
LET'S GET BRITAIN TO PAY SOME

42:00.633 --> 42:01.133
REPARATIONS, SHE SHOULDN'T BE

42:01.200 --> 42:03.033
THERE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE

42:03.100 --> 42:03.366
ROYAL FAMILY.

42:03.433 --> 42:07.400
[APPLAUSE]

42:07.466 --> 42:09.100
>> IT'S TRUE, WITH OTHER PEOPLE

42:09.166 --> 42:10.800
LIKE THAT YOUNG EDITOR WHO HAD

42:10.866 --> 42:11.500
JUST BEEN GIVEN HER BIG BREAK

42:11.566 --> 42:16.433
AND DISCOVERED 11-YEAR-OLD

42:16.500 --> 42:17.766
TWEETS WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN TIERED

42:17.833 --> 42:20.633
EUROS SOLD WERE GOING TO DESTROY

42:20.700 --> 42:20.933
HER CAREER.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.033
IF YOU HAVEN'T SCREWED UP AS A

42:22.100 --> 42:24.100
TEENAGER YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER

42:24.166 --> 42:24.466
BEEN A TEENAGER.

42:24.533 --> 42:27.400
WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOESN'T HAVE

42:27.466 --> 42:30.166
HUGE MISTAKES FROM THAT PERIOD

42:30.233 --> 42:30.566
OF TIME?

42:30.633 --> 42:31.600
>> Bill: TED CRUZ BECAUSE HE

42:31.666 --> 42:35.300
KNEW HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR

42:35.366 --> 42:35.966
PRESIDENT.

42:36.033 --> 42:37.400
TED CRUZ DOESN'T, HE KNEW WHEN

42:37.466 --> 42:39.566
HE WAS EIGHT HE STARTED RUNNING

42:39.633 --> 42:41.566
FOR PRESIDENT AND THAT'S NOT THE

42:41.633 --> 42:43.200
GUY YOU WANT AS PRESIDENT.

42:43.266 --> 42:46.800
>> YOU'RE MAKING MY POINT.

42:46.866 --> 42:49.400
>> Bill: I AM MAKING YOUR

42:49.466 --> 42:49.666
POINT TO.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.433
>> ANY TIME SOMEONE GETS FIRED

42:52.500 --> 42:54.866
AT "TEEN VOGUE" IT'S A WIN FOR

42:54.933 --> 42:55.600
THE COUNTRY, EVERYONE SHOULD BE

42:55.666 --> 42:56.833
FIRED, THEY SHOULD SHUT THAT

42:56.900 --> 42:58.700
THING DOWN, THEY SHOULD SALT THE

42:58.766 --> 43:00.233
EARTH AND THEY SHOULD GO

43:00.300 --> 43:02.600
INDEPENDENCE I LOOK AT IT TODAY,

43:02.666 --> 43:04.833
THEY HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT WHY WE

43:04.900 --> 43:05.533
SHOULD ABOLISH THE POLICE IN THE

43:05.600 --> 43:07.733
NEXT ARTICLE WAS ABOUT ONE OF

43:07.800 --> 43:11.200
THE OLSEN TWINS HAIRCUT.

43:11.266 --> 43:13.366
>> Bill: THEN YOU READ THE

43:13.433 --> 43:14.433
STATEMENT FROM THEM WE HAD TO DO

43:14.500 --> 43:16.233
THIS SO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF

43:16.300 --> 43:18.000
"TEEN VOGUE" -- THE IMPORTANT

43:18.066 --> 43:20.200
WORK, ARE YOU KIDDING?

43:20.266 --> 43:22.000
IT'S ABOUT CLOSE FOR TEENAGERS,

43:22.066 --> 43:22.266
ISN'T IT?

43:22.333 --> 43:24.266
>> IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN THAT BUT

43:24.333 --> 43:25.800
TEENAGE GIRLS, THERE IS A HUGE

43:25.866 --> 43:27.133
COMMUNITY THEY CAN REACH ONE

43:27.200 --> 43:29.400
ANOTHER ON A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL

43:29.466 --> 43:33.533
LEVEL ON INSTAGRAM AND SO FORTH,

43:33.600 --> 43:34.433
ADULTS AT THE DEPRAVED

43:34.500 --> 43:37.266
INSTITUTION OF CONDE NAST SHOULD

43:37.333 --> 43:38.266
NOT BE PROFITING OVER FEEDING

43:38.333 --> 43:40.533
THEIR HEADS WITH THIS POISONOUS,

43:40.600 --> 43:43.800
VAPID LEFT WING AGENDA THAT

43:43.866 --> 43:45.200
MAKES THESE GIRLS DUMBER BECAUSE

43:45.266 --> 43:46.733
EVERY TIME THEY RUN SOMETHING ON

43:46.800 --> 43:47.666
FOREIGN POLICY YOU LOOK AT IT

43:47.733 --> 43:49.133
AND GO THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND

43:49.200 --> 43:50.700
THAT'S NOT RIGHT IN THESE GIRLS,

43:50.766 --> 43:53.033
IT'S GREAT, I'M GOING TO GET

43:53.100 --> 43:55.466
THAT HAIRCUT AND BE ON THE SIDE

43:55.533 --> 43:56.866
OF THIS THING, IT'S TERRIBLE.

43:56.933 --> 43:59.033
>> Bill: I HAVE ONE MINUTE AND

43:59.100 --> 44:00.366
I KNOW YOU BOTH HAVE WRITTEN

44:00.433 --> 44:01.900

PEOPLE WHO GET THIS NETWORK

44:03.700 --> 44:04.233
PROBABLY SAW THE DOCUMENTARY.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.533
I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY ABOUT

44:06.600 --> 44:08.100
IT.

44:08.166 --> 44:10.166
THE TITLE OFFENDED ME -- NOT

44:10.233 --> 44:11.100
OFFENDED ME, WAS BULLSHIT AND IT

44:11.166 --> 44:13.333
MAY ALL BE TRUE.

44:13.400 --> 44:18.933
THE TITLE OF THE DOCUMENTARY

44:19.000 --> 44:30.200
WHICH IS ALAN ALLEN V FARROW, T

44:30.266 --> 44:34.366
SUGGESTS THERE WAS A TRIAL IN A

44:34.433 --> 44:35.466
PROSECUTION.

44:35.533 --> 44:35.833
IT'S MISLEADING.

44:35.900 --> 44:37.800
>> THE TWO CONTEMPORANEOUS

44:37.866 --> 44:40.366
REPORTS THAT CAME OUT ACQUITTED

44:40.433 --> 44:41.600
WHICH MEANS PEOPLE WHO THINK

44:41.666 --> 44:43.833
THEY KNOW THE STORY DON'T KNOW

44:43.900 --> 44:44.100
THE STORY.

44:44.166 --> 44:45.400
>> Bill: AND NOW THEY KNOW ONE

44:45.466 --> 44:46.866
SIDE OF THE STORY AND I'M GLAD I

44:46.933 --> 44:48.666
DO, BUT DON'T TELL ME I SAW THE

44:48.733 --> 44:49.133
WHOLE STORY.

44:49.200 --> 44:56.500
>> WHY IS HBO PROFITING, MAKING

44:56.566 --> 44:57.266
A FOUR NIGHT SPECTACULAR.

45:04.066 --> 45:04.933
TIME FOR NEW RULES EVERYBODY,

45:23.066 --> 45:23.266
[LAUGHTER]

45:23.333 --> 45:24.100
THAT WOULD MAKE ME NOT WANT TO

45:24.166 --> 45:25.466
GO TO A PARTY.

45:25.533 --> 45:26.333
"WHERE'S THE PARTY?"

45:26.400 --> 45:29.100
"WELL, IT'S PARTLY ON A CAR."

45:29.166 --> 45:29.866
JAMES BROWN ONCE SANG "GET UP

45:29.933 --> 45:31.433
OFFA THAT THING."

45:31.500 --> 45:36.566

[LAUGHTER]

45:56.033 --> 45:57.200

45:57.266 --> 45:59.833
NEW RULE: THE NICOBAR PIGEON HAS

45:59.900 --> 46:02.000
TO GET OVER ITSELF AND REALIZE

46:02.066 --> 46:02.633
THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY "YOU'RE SO

46:02.700 --> 46:03.433
BEAUTIFUL," THEY MEAN "FOR A

46:03.500 --> 46:07.433

YOUR COMPETITION IS DIRT-GRAY,

LITTLE JOKES.

46:33.566 --> 46:34.500
NEW RULE: SOMEONE HAS TO TELL ME

46:34.566 --> 46:35.466
WHY ALL THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC

46:35.533 --> 46:38.466
LOOK LIKE IUDS.

46:38.533 --> 46:39.866
LOOK AT THAT -- IT CAN'T JUST BE

46:39.933 --> 46:40.800
COINCIDENCE.

46:40.866 --> 46:43.300
DOES BIRTH CONTROL COME FROM

46:43.366 --> 46:44.766
SPACE?

46:44.833 --> 46:46.133
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, THIS ONE'S

NEW RULE: THAT GUY AT EVERY

BREAKDANCES.

46:57.466 --> 46:59.500
HAS TO SIT DOWN.

46:59.566 --> 47:00.433
YOU'RE NOT THE LIFE OF THE

47:00.500 --> 47:01.866
PARTY.

47:01.933 --> 47:03.133
YOU'RE THE DRUNK GUY WHO JUST

47:03.200 --> 47:09.633
KICKED GRANDMA IN THE FACE.

ROARING "20S, LET'S NOT REPEAT

47:13.433 --> 47:15.533
THE MISTAKES OF THE LAST ONE.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.366
I KEEP READING THAT AMERICA IS

47:17.433 --> 47:18.800
POISED FOR A ROARING "20S, 21ST

47:18.866 --> 47:21.633
CENTURY EDITION - A REPEAT OF

47:21.700 --> 47:23.633
THAT DECADE A CENTURY AGO, WHEN,

47:23.700 --> 47:24.900
JUST LIKE NOW, THE UNITED STATES

47:24.966 --> 47:27.066
EMERGED FROM A PANDEMIC READY TO

47:27.133 --> 47:29.166
PARTY AS IF THERE WAS COCAINE IN

47:29.233 --> 47:34.733
THE COCA-COLA - WHICH THERE WAS.

47:34.800 --> 47:39.766
[LAUGHTER]

47:39.833 --> 47:45.700
THERE WAS, IN THE 20s.

47:45.766 --> 47:46.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

47:46.233 --> 47:47.500
AND NOW, AFTER A YEAR OF MASKING

47:47.566 --> 47:48.400
AND DISTANCING, I KNOW I'M READY

47:48.466 --> 47:49.866
FOR THE PARTY, AND I IMAGINE

47:49.933 --> 47:51.466
MILLIONS OF OTHERS ARE ALSO

47:51.533 --> 47:53.766
ITCHING TO ENGAGE IN RISKY

47:53.833 --> 47:54.833
BEHAVIORS, LIKE AIR TRAVEL,

47:54.900 --> 47:56.433
SHARING A DESSERT OR TWEETING

47:56.500 --> 48:00.933
WHAT YOU REALLY THINK.

48:01.000 --> 48:01.200
[LAUGHTER]

48:01.266 --> 48:02.433
AND WHY NOT?

48:02.500 --> 48:04.100
THE 1920S WAS AN ESPECIALLY

48:04.166 --> 48:05.866
EXCITING TIME: THE ECONOMY

48:05.933 --> 48:08.000
DOUBLED THE MASSES COULD AFFORD

48:08.066 --> 48:09.666
A CAR, AND WOMEN STOPPED WEARING

48:09.733 --> 48:12.700
SIXTEEN LAYERS OF CLOTHING.

48:12.766 --> 48:14.166
NO DREAM WAS TOO BIG: CHARLES

[LAUGHTER]

48:14.500 --> 48:15.300
LINDBERGH BECAME THE FIRST

RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:43.900 --> 48:45.266
AND THE STOCK MARKET WAS A GAME

48:45.333 --> 48:47.933
WHERE EVERYBODY WAS A WINNER.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.266
BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

48:49.333 --> 48:49.866
NEXT.

48:49.933 --> 48:51.300
THE ROARING "20S BECAME THE

48:51.366 --> 48:53.333
BROKE-ASS "30S.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
IT TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE WITH

48:54.466 --> 48:55.900
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, THE RISE

48:55.966 --> 48:57.833
OF FASCISM, AND WORST OF ALL, AN

48:57.900 --> 48:59.100
ENDLESS STREAM OF MUSICALS ABOUT

48:59.166 --> 49:05.000
SAILORS.

49:05.066 --> 49:05.266
[LAUGHTER]

49:05.333 --> 49:07.000
AND LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC

49:07.066 --> 49:08.500
FACTORS RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS LIKE

49:08.566 --> 49:09.966
WE'RE BACK IN THE HEADSPACE THAT

49:10.033 --> 49:11.366
WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT OF CASH AS

49:11.433 --> 49:12.633
LONG AS THE FED DOESN'T RUN OUT

49:12.700 --> 49:14.133
OF INK.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.500
I'M JUST SAYING, IF WE'RE GOING

49:15.566 --> 49:17.366
TO DO A NEW ROARING "20S, LET'S

49:17.433 --> 49:18.533
DO IT THIS TIME WITHOUT THE TWO

49:18.600 --> 49:20.833
THINGS THAT MADE THE LAST ONE

49:20.900 --> 49:22.233
SUCK: PROHIBITION AND A

49:22.300 --> 49:28.166
DEPRESSION AT THE END OF IT.

[LAUGHTER]

49:28.500 --> 49:32.266
[APPLAUSE]

49:32.333 --> 49:34.133
I'M NO MONEY EXPERT - I ONLY

49:34.200 --> 49:37.166
TURN ON JIM CRAMER TO SCARE AWAY

49:37.233 --> 49:41.166
THE BIRDS - BUT IT DOES SEEM

49:41.233 --> 49:42.633
LIKE THE MARKET IS A LITTLE

49:42.700 --> 49:43.966
DIVORCED FROM REALITY THESE

49:44.033 --> 49:46.266
DAYS.

49:46.333 --> 49:47.300
IT'S ODD THAT THE REAL ECONOMY

49:47.366 --> 49:48.500
HAS BEEN FULL OF NEWS OF

49:48.566 --> 49:50.666
UNEMPLOYMENT, BANKRUPTCIES AND

49:50.733 --> 49:53.666
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SIGNS

49:53.733 --> 49:55.666
SINCE COVID HIT, AND YET THE S&P

49:55.733 --> 49:57.866
IS UP 76% IN THAT TIME.

49:57.933 --> 49:59.800
IT CAN'T GO UP FOREVER.

49:59.866 --> 50:02.400
WE CAN'T ALL WIN.

50:02.466 --> 50:10.466
IT'S NOT THE TICKET MACHINE AT

50:10.533 --> 50:11.300
CHUCK E CHEESE.

50:11.366 --> 50:12.666
A SHARE OF GAMESTOP ISN'T REALLY

50:12.733 --> 50:13.566
WORTH MORE THAN A SHARE OF

50:13.633 --> 50:14.366
TOYOTA.

50:14.433 --> 50:15.666
TO BAIL OURSELVES OUT OF THAT

50:15.733 --> 50:16.966
DEPRESSION, WE SPENT, OVER 10

50:17.033 --> 50:17.866
YEARS, 6% OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC

50:17.933 --> 50:19.066
PRODUCT.

50:19.133 --> 50:20.333
TO GET OUT OF COVID, WE SPENT,

50:20.400 --> 50:22.333
IN ONE YEAR, 26% OF GDP.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.766
THE WAY WE'RE HANDING OUT MONEY,

50:23.833 --> 50:25.866
YOU'D THINK IT HAD AN EXPIRATION

50:25.933 --> 50:27.700
DATE ON IT.

50:27.766 --> 50:29.433
IN 2008, WHEN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

50:29.500 --> 50:30.166
WAS ON THE EDGE OF COLLAPSE

50:30.233 --> 50:32.500
CONGRESS PASSED WHAT WAS

50:32.566 --> 50:34.800
CONSIDERED A MASSIVE BAILOUT OF

50:34.866 --> 50:36.266
$700 BILLION - SO MASSIVE, OVER

50:36.333 --> 50:37.433
A HUNDRED PROTESTS BROKE OUT

50:37.500 --> 50:39.433
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.733
THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT

50:40.800 --> 50:42.033
WAS BORN.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.333
NOW?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.266
THE WORD "BILLION" IS SO LAST

50:45.333 --> 50:47.200
DECADE.

50:47.266 --> 50:49.433
CONGRESS HAS PASSED $6 TRILLION

50:49.500 --> 50:51.766
TO FIGHT THE WAR ON COVID - TWO

50:51.833 --> 50:53.633
TRILLION MORE THAN WE SPENT TO

50:53.700 --> 50:55.633
WIN WORLD WAR TWO.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.633
YOU KNOW, THE "BIG ONE?"

50:57.700 --> 51:00.133
FOUR YEARS OF DESPERATE FIGHTING

51:00.200 --> 51:01.900
AGAINST A MURDERER'S ROW OF BAD

51:01.966 --> 51:05.433
GUYS ALL OVER THE WORLD.

51:05.500 --> 51:08.400
AND UNDER IT.

51:08.466 --> 51:09.533
NOT TO MENTION THIS THING WAS

51:09.600 --> 51:13.533
KIND OF EXPENSIVE TO MAKE.

51:13.600 --> 51:14.433
ALL THAT, IN TODAY'S DOLLARS?

51:14.500 --> 51:15.966
4 TRILLION.

51:16.033 --> 51:17.133
THIS?

51:17.200 --> 51:23.333
