You know you at the top

Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

01:42.353 --> 01:44.344
Mom, Dad's home!

01:49.360 --> 01:51.191
This is quite the spread, Spencey.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.395
When did you become such a griddle man?

01:53.489 --> 01:56.231
I got tired of my eggs getting cold
while I signed autographs.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.032
Oh, my God. I know what you mean.
That's so annoying, right?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.953
(LAUGHS) Joe, why don't you share
the good news with the boys?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.028
JOE: Yeah? All right.

02:03.124 --> 02:07.743
I worked a little magic with Maximo
and got him down to 150 grand.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.793
SPENCER: The man has delivered.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.122
500 to 150? That's... Damn, worm.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.798
JASON: It’s a good deal, Vernon.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.796
Ah, there you are, J. We thought we lost you.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.503
I'm everywhere I need to be at all times.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.099
Including the golf course.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.469
Listen, I got a family emergency
that couldn't be helped.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.722
But I'm telling you to give her the money.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.098
It’s a no-brainer.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.521
Hey, listen, Vern.
Look, we don't like this either, okay?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.519
But the pictures she has can hurt you.

02:31.610 --> 02:36.104
And all things considered,
$150,000 is a fucking fire sale.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.699
It's a gift from God.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.398
And Joe Krutel.

02:39.577 --> 02:42.614
(SIGHS) But I'm the one giving
my hard-earned cash away.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.536
This shit ain't right.

02:44.915 --> 02:48.043
You just got your roster bonus in.
Let's pretend it never happened.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.083
l was gonna use that
to square things with you.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.163
You can pay him back
when Jason closes your contract extension.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.213
JASON: Buddy, it’s only days away if you pay.

02:55.301 --> 02:58.213
But if I pay her, where the fuck does it end?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.260
Tell you what. I'll pay her.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.057
Huh?

03:05.394 --> 03:06.600
What?

03:06.687 --> 03:09.850
You pay me what you owe me out of
your roster bonus and I'll take it from there.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.898
-That works for me.
-l'm sure it does, Reg.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.324
All right, look, here's the deal.

03:22.411 --> 03:26.120
It was our party. I invited you.
I let things get out of control.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.697
Okay? I'm gonna pay Maximo the money,

03:27.792 --> 03:30.534
I'm gonna get back our photo files,
and then it's done.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.040
No hard feelings, no debt owed.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.746
-You sure about this, Spence?
-1,000% sure.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.332
If they had Snapchat and lnstagram
back when l was your age,

03:38.427 --> 03:41.009
shit, I would have been put on a lifetime ban.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.886
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:43.474 --> 03:45.590
I had to start paying attention.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.094
That's the thing I want from you, Vern.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.552
From now on,
I want you to start paying attention.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.057
Here, look at me. Look at me.

03:51.148 --> 03:55.107
So, let's learn from this, let's be smart,
let's move on, the both of us.

I'll keep learning.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.526
-Thanks, man.
-You got it.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.824
Hey, so, you going to see Maximo now?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.117
No, I'm gonna drop by Tina's.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.990
I gotta take care
of some Roddney business first.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.491
Okay. How is Rod?

04:10.543 --> 04:12.158
He's still dead, man.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.668
Oh. Shit. My bad.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.833
Take it easy, Spencey.

That's big of you, man,
picking up the kid's tab,

04:22.888 --> 04:25.265
but 150K is a lot of money.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.464
Let me split it with you, all right?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.220
-No. No, no, no.
-Fifty-fifty. Come on.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.347
No, no. Thank you, though. I know Angie.
I'll take care of it. You get the next one.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.228

for you or what?

and now you gotta give her space.

-(LAUGHS)
-All right, so, what you want to do,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.756
-you want to broil this at about 450 degrees...
-Okay.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.684
...so the top stays nice and crunchy,
the inside stays nice and moist.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.137
Now, that right there, Tina,
is Grandma's recipe.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.347

-Footbal| practice.
-This early in the summer?

06:06.075 --> 06:09.533
Yeah, had him playing 7-on-7
over at Central High,

06:09.620 --> 06:11.531
same place Rod set all those state records.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.955
But for Junior, it's AAU.
Pretty much a year-round thing now.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.124
SPENCER: Do you have
any concern about him playing?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.372
No, l grill the coaches
about proper technique,

06:19.463 --> 06:21.454
so he knows how
to protect himself. (CHUCKLES)

06:21.966 --> 06:24.548
Stays out every night till the lights go out.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.001
Still the best way for him
to connect with his father, you know?

06:27.096 --> 06:28.381
SPENCER: Yeah.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.837
Far better than this.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.977
Wow.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.056
Roddney always knew

06:37.147 --> 06:38.182
-how to make an entrance.

-What are you gonna do with him?
-I just did it.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.899
No. No, no, no.

06:45.990 --> 06:49.357
Roddney needs to be at
home with you and RJ.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.238
The gardener spent more time here
than Roddney did.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.945
Road trips, charity events, camps.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.156
Other extracurricular activities.

Spencer, please.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.247
-You'|l figure out what to do with him.
-No, no.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.953
I don't even know what to do with myself.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.164
If anyone can find a final resting place
for him, it's you.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.920
Where do | start?
I don't know where to start with this.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.297
It's not about where you start,
it's where you finish.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.798
There you are.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.974
l was getting worried. Was the traffic bad?

07:16.061 --> 07:19.349
No, but I did consider driving off the bridge
a couple times on the way down here.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.265
-You look skinny.
-l'm too busy to eat, Ma.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.692
-Come on, where is this guy?
-He's in the kitchen, juicing.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.519
-PEDs?
-No.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.448
Kale, lemon, ginger, cayenne pepper.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.241
It tastes like ass,
but it's supposed to be good for you.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.116
Now, I want you to be nice to David.

07:36.206 --> 07:40.495
He's been very kind,
and it's been a while since your father left me.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.998
He didn't leave you, Ma. He died.

07:43.631 --> 07:48.000
I don't know where this is going,
but David wants to get serious.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.716
Like, how serious?

07:50.095 --> 07:51.551
Well, exclusive.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.926
No more sex outside the relationship.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.132
(SIGHS) I'm gonna throw up.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.513
Don't. Listen to me.

07:59.605 --> 08:03.268
I want your opinion before fully committing.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.146
I love you, Ma. All right?

08:07.237 --> 08:09.489
So, if you're happy, I'm happy.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.446
(CHUCKLES) Good.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.524
-Now let's meet David.
-Okay.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.201
MOTHER: David?
DAVID: Yeah?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.700
Look who's here.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.365
Hey, dude. You must be Jason.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.495
JASON: Oh, shit.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.252
You must be young.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.005
It's great the way
Ricky opened up the way he did.

08:28.092 --> 08:31.584
And on national TV.
Shit, shocked the hell out of me.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.510
Talking about his dad like that
took some balls.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.181
Textbook Ricky. Digs himself a hole
and then he charms his way out of it.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.430
Well, I sure hate to
throw that brother a shovel,

08:40.521 --> 08:42.386
but he is out of control, Bella.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.437
All right? That's what I came here to tell you.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.274
Do you want me to pretend to be shocked?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.522
You know? So you don't feel
like you wasted your time?

08:49.613 --> 08:51.114
(CHUCKLES)

08:51.490 --> 08:53.105
He's got another house.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.948
He calls it the Funhouse.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.903
I had to pull Charles' big behind out of there
the other day.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.454
Girl, he was high as a giraffe's ass.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.538
They have a sex room and a love pond,

09:04.628 --> 09:06.584
a whole bunch of nasty skanks
roaming the halls.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.037
Just disgusting.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.666
I kicked one of his housemates in the dick,
if that makes you feel any better.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.920
You knew about this Funhouse?

09:17.850 --> 09:19.260
I heard about it a couple times.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.637
-The girls, they talk about it.
-They don't talk to me.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.390
Nobody wanted to embarrass you.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.056
And what do you think I am right now?

09:29.570 --> 09:33.654
I would say embarrassed,
ashamed, furious, mortified...

09:33.741 --> 09:36.904
Over it. I'm just over it.
Can we go get a real drink?

09:37.745 --> 09:39.781
Hell, yeah, we can go get a real drink, girl.

09:39.872 --> 09:43.080
We can get a whole bunch of real drinks.
Girl, you deserve it.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.752
-CHARLES: So, what don't you understand?
-All of it.

09:45.836 --> 09:50.751
Now, what's that "gun trips right
Z short 75 max combo fade" shit?

09:50.841 --> 09:52.377
What the fuck am I running?

09:52.468 --> 09:53.503
(GRUNTS)

09:53.844 --> 09:55.425
This route's easy, Rick.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.718
You're on the front side.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.841
The combo speaks of
the strength of the formation.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.511
You run a quick out,
and the fade is for the X on the backside.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.012
See? You see what I'm talking about?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.389
Now, you might as well
be speaking Swahili right now.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.438
You need to sit still
for a few minutes and focus.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.688
Shit, I am focused, man. That shit's fucked.
The system's fucked.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.813
This ain't got nothing to do with the system.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.820
This is all about Annabella, ain't it?

10:20.496 --> 10:22.828
Yeah, your girl left you again,

10:22.915 --> 10:26.658
and this time it's driving you crazy because
you know you really messed things up.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.285
No, I'm not thinking about her,
what's-her-name, at all.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.789
-Oh, no?
-No.

10:30.881 --> 10:34.214
Well, why you been banging out
on the leg press for 20 minutes straight, then?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.129
-(GRUNTS)
-Somebody going at it that hard

10:36.220 --> 10:38.757
might be trying to blow off some steam.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.883
Some steam created by his girl leaving him.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.138
You know what? Fine, all right?
You're right. You happy?

10:45.229 --> 10:48.312
Man, I hate this shit, man.
What the fuck she leave me for?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.559
She reached her breaking point.
That surprises you?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.812
Hell, yeah. Well, how was I supposed to
see that coming?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.313
You weren't.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.565
You were supposed to be better to her
so it never came.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.450
ljust want her to call me back, man.
Is that so much to ask for?

11:01.537 --> 11:02.572
Let me ask you something.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.530
Do you love Annabella
or do you just hate being alone?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.582
I don't know. What's the difference?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.998
All right. I'll ask you another way.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.580
Do you want her or do you need her?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.544
I need her.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.626
Well, I mean, lwant her.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.506
I don't know, man. lwant her and need her.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.679
What the fuck are you
throwing these trick questions at me for?

11:22.766 --> 11:24.006
All right, listen.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.342
Quit calling. Go see your girl.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.778

11:50.836 --> 11:53.703
Maximo, listen, man.
I'm glad we can finally agree on a price.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.379
And I hope your other buyers
weren't too devastated.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.455
Nah.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.377
-ls there a problem?
-A slight change of plans.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.429
Maximo, we had an agreement, okay?

12:04.516 --> 12:07.098
$150,000. We shook hands.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.268
It's not my call.
Miss Lee wants a cherry on top.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.555
Does she also want a pint of Vernon's blood?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.481
How about his first-born child?
Would she like that?

12:15.569 --> 12:17.355
She simply wants a sit-down.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.687
No. No, we're not gonna do that.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.398
We're not gonna put Vernon in that situation.
No sit-down.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.530
It's not Vernon she wants to sit down with.
It's you, Spencer.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.997
She wants to see your face
when you hand her the check.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.744
-Maybe catch up on old times.
-He'll do it.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.245
No, I won't do it.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.168
No, he will not do it.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.086
No, I'm not gonna fucking do it.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.631
It was $150,000, no sit-down.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.629
What's next? She has more pictures?
She wants more money?

12:41.720 --> 12:43.335
Look, don't shoot the messenger, okay?

12:43.472 --> 12:45.679
It's 150, a sit-down, or there's no deal.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.138
There's no fucking sit-down!

12:47.225 --> 12:48.260
You call us all the way down here

12:48.352 --> 12:49.683
when you knew
the fucking deal wasn't square?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.385
There is no fucking sit-down.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.768
Here's her goddamn check.
She cashes it when | get my pictures.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.359

16:11.763 --> 16:15.472
and then, pow,
no more moping around for me.

to take your mind off things.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.137
Are you crazy, Ricky? Go home!

20:28.228 --> 20:30.264
What, so you can get with
Jolly Green Giant over here?

20:30.355 --> 20:31.936
-You better chill out there, Jerret.
-Are you serious?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.058
You don't want to drag me into this.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.650
You're gonna have enough
problems dealing with her.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.395
Bird. Bird, we're good. Come on, Rick.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.896
Everybody just calm the fuck down.

20:37.987 --> 20:38.976
Hey, your boy's nuts, Spencer.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.482
He gonna come over here acting all crazy.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.064
I'm in the middle of a conversation with Bella.
I'm gonna fuck him up.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.571
-We got him, Bird.
-Bella, just come home, baby.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.244
If you're so lonely, go back to your Funhouse.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.242
I'm sure you can find some company there.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.790
-Wait, you told her?
-She had a right to know.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.254
Yeah. I should have never
let you into the Funhouse. I knew that.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.499
Don't blame Charles.
See, that's your problem, Ricky.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.296
It's always somebody did you wrong.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.884
Well, I'm done being your cheerleader
and your doormat.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.758
Fine. Fine! You know what?
Have it your own way.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.760
If you're gonna get under someone
to get over someone,

21:07.851 --> 21:09.057
I'm gonna do the same thing.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.601
And you, LeBron did the right thing
about going back to Cleveland.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.848
Fuck you!

21:12.939 --> 21:14.930
(ALL CLAMORING)

21:17.569 --> 21:18.604
-l'm sick of this shit, man!
-Come on!

21:18.695 --> 21:19.901
I'm right here. What do you want to do?

21:19.988 --> 21:22.650
-Man, I can't stand this shit, man.
-Let go! What the fuck you doin'?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.116
What the fuck you doin'?
You acting out again?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.316
You know what the fuck we were gonna do
tonight before we got here?

21:26.411 --> 21:27.821
We were gonna go spread Rod's ashes.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.322
Now, you remember Rod, right?

21:29.414 --> 21:32.497
He got swept up in life
and then died doing this shit, acting out,

21:32.584 --> 21:34.074
just like you're fucking acting out right now.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.830
Think about that shit for a second.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.248
A second?
Man, lthink about that shit all the time, man.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.000
-And I know you do, too.
-I do. I do.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.080
So, fuck this.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.542
Come with me and Charles
and we'll go put him to rest together.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.048
-Let's do it together.
-Man, we did that weeks ago, man.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.846
All right? I hate to break it to you,
but that's just dust in a jar.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.219
All right? He is gone and so am I.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.972
(TV PLAYING)

22:00.862 --> 22:03.899
COMMENTATOR: (ON TV)
...72-67, lthink, is the ﬁrst one.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.154
And a lot of these holes carry over water.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.495
-(MOANING)
-So, you need bombers

22:09.579 --> 22:10.910
who can put the ball high in the air,

22:11.498 --> 22:13.864
hit the ball and not get it to roll off

22:13.958 --> 22:17.246
these very, very tapered
and measured embankments.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.088
CHARLES: (SIGHS)
This is my first time being on the field

22:30.183 --> 22:32.174
since I hung up my spikes.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.474
SPENCER: How's it feel?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.188
CHARLES: Good as hell.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.598
SPENCER: Sounds like you want
to lace 'em up again.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.191
CHARLES: What makes you say that?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.020
SPENCER: The look in your eye.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.365
Hear it in your voice.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.441
I rewrote my un-retirement speech
at least 15 times.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.327
-I can't stop missing it, Spence.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:53.414 --> 22:55.450
You never will, man.

22:55.542 --> 22:59.160
-The guys, the routine, the competition.
-Mmm-hmm.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.954
Man, I even miss the fucking jock itch.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.458
Yeah, but you got out in one piece.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.553
I ain't in one piece, though, Spence.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.382
Football made me whole.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.562
I know you can't argue that.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.307
I can't argue with that.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.061
You should do it.

23:24.821 --> 23:28.279
You should come back
and you should leave it all out on the field

23:29.409 --> 23:32.367
so you never give yourself a reason
to ever look back.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.903

Jason Antolotti.
(IMITATES CROWD CHEERING)

23:51.723 --> 23:52.803
For you, Pops.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.115
All right, Rod.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.915
Right back where you started.
