WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.000 --> 01:09.208
Christopher Robin: Yee-ha!

01:09.208 --> 01:10.708
Tigger: Hey, little dogies!

01:10.708 --> 01:13.250
Rabbit: Whoa, partner.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.583
Pooh: Yippie-yi-- Oh, bother.

01:21.291 --> 01:24.416
Come on, Christopher Robin.
Let me run the choo-choo.

01:24.416 --> 01:26.875
I want to send it into a wall
and see what happens.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.750
I don't know if
you're ready, Tigger.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.583
You've never
run a train before.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.500
They're not so easy.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.583
Aw, running trains is
what tiggers do the best.

01:35.583 --> 01:38.708
Say, where's the propeller
on this thing?

01:38.708 --> 01:42.208
Tigger, trains
don't have propellers.

01:42.208 --> 01:45.250
Although it does seem
to be missing its rudder.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.458
Oh, d-d-dear.

01:47.458 --> 01:48.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.083
Oh, d-d-dearie dear.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.416
Don't you enjoy

01:52.416 --> 01:54.125
playing with the train,
Piglet?

01:57.583 --> 01:58.958
Woman:
Christopher Robin!

01:58.958 --> 02:00.416
Coming, Mom.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.125
Whew. I thought
I'd get it in the end.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.000
I guess I did.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Hey, guys,
don't touch the train

02:10.000 --> 02:12.083
until I get back
from lunch, okay?

02:12.083 --> 02:14.625
You can count on me,
Christopher Robin.

02:14.625 --> 02:17.375
I'll keep an eye
on these desperados.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.416
Got to go.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.458
So what do you say
we take the choo-choo

02:23.458 --> 02:25.375
for a little ring-a-ding spin?

02:25.375 --> 02:26.958
I don't know.

02:26.958 --> 02:29.291
Something terrible
might happen, Tigger.

02:30.291 --> 02:31.958
Perhaps
we should go outside

02:31.958 --> 02:34.333
and play a game--
a nice quiet game

02:34.333 --> 02:36.333
like, uh,
guess who's sleeping?

02:36.333 --> 02:38.333
But how will the winner
know he won

02:38.333 --> 02:39.625
if he's asleep?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.458
Oh, we'll tell him

02:41.458 --> 02:43.375
when he wakes up, Rabbit.

02:43.375 --> 02:46.625
No fair taking a head start.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.625
Piglet, Pooh's already
trying to go to sleep.

02:49.625 --> 02:52.000
We all have to be awake
to go to sleep.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.583
Otherwise,

02:54.583 --> 02:56.583
the person who falls
asleep won't be awake.

02:56.583 --> 02:57.583
Right?

03:01.166 --> 03:02.583
This is our chance.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.333
I've always wanted
to engendineer a train.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.625
But I thought
Christopher Robin
said not to touch it.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.875
I'm not gonna touch the train.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.875
I'm gonna touch the controls.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.166
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:14.166 --> 03:17.708
Aren't the controls
part of the train?

03:17.708 --> 03:20.208
Nah. They don't
even know each other.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.375
Oh, then perhaps we
should introduce them.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.833
Besides, Christopher Robin
won't mind

03:29.833 --> 03:32.000
if we borrowed a train.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.875
Especially if he
doesn't find out.

03:40.083 --> 03:44.833
I hope the train stops
before the train...stops.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.458
Oops. Well, if I can't
steer the train,

03:47.458 --> 03:49.000
maybe I can steer the tracks.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.208
Let's make a figure 8--
nah, a figure 9.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.250
No. A figurine.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:00.250 --> 04:01.875
Hey! Where are you going?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.000
Runaway train!
Runaway train!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.875
Come on, buddy bear,
we got to catch it,

04:05.875 --> 04:07.958
or our borrowing days
are over!

04:11.708 --> 04:13.708
Rabbit: I tell you,
I would have run.

04:13.708 --> 04:17.333
I passed out three times
just going down the stairs.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.583
Look! The train's gone.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.083
And so are Tigger and Pooh.

04:23.083 --> 04:27.250
Mm. Remember how Tigger
talked about touching it?

04:27.250 --> 04:29.625
I bet they took the train.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.708
No. That can't be.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.291
Pooh's
not a train robber,

04:33.291 --> 04:34.875
and Tigger's not a--

04:34.875 --> 04:37.125
Pooh's
not a train robber.

04:37.125 --> 04:40.583
Train robber,
train robber, train robber...

04:47.125 --> 04:49.583
Reach for the clouds,
you big train, you.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.625
Yee-ha! Yee-ha!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.625
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:56.250 --> 04:58.875
Hmm. Almost lost my hat.

05:04.958 --> 05:07.833
I am the tigger with no name.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.875
I am the pooh with a name,

05:10.875 --> 05:13.000
if only I could remember it.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.708
Oh, bother.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.125
Say, How'd you get
here so fast?

05:17.125 --> 05:18.583
It's a fantasy.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.375
Hmm, wonder how you
run this choo-choo.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.333
Doesn't look too complicated.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.875
Must take
that delicatessen touch.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.708
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Hey, what's all the commotion?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.416
Yaah!

06:01.625 --> 06:04.708
Mm. I think
I'll stay down here

06:04.708 --> 06:06.875
until the fool's rush is over.

06:13.083 --> 06:17.208
Yaah!

06:32.708 --> 06:34.458
Help! Help!

06:34.458 --> 06:37.458
The Hole In the Head Gang
stole the train!

06:37.458 --> 06:40.708
Oh, my. I must find
Sheriff Piglet.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.583
The Hole In the Head Gang?

06:44.583 --> 06:46.291
Oh, d-d-dear.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.958
Toot! Toot! Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:05.583 --> 07:08.166
Say, buddy bear,
could you feed the furnace

07:08.166 --> 07:11.125
till I can figure out
how to stop this choo-choo?

07:14.833 --> 07:18.166
Perhaps the furnace would
like a smackerel of honey.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.083
I know I would.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.583
Rabbit: You're the only one

07:22.583 --> 07:24.583
who can stop
the train robbers.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.125
Sheriff, the town
depends on you.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.875
It's your duty to hunt down
those low-down desperados

07:29.875 --> 07:31.000
Tigger and Pooh.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.875
Pooh? But Pooh
wouldn't take a train.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.833
Honey, perhaps,
but not a train.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.166
I don't know.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.583
Anyone who acts
that innocent

07:41.583 --> 07:43.583
must not be as
innocent as he acts.

07:43.583 --> 07:47.708
Just another case
of a bear gone bad.

07:47.708 --> 07:50.958
I guess I'll have to do it,
but I'll need some deputies.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.291
Guess he means us.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.750
By the power invested in me
as sheriff of this fantasy,

08:13.750 --> 08:17.000
I arrest you for train-napping
in the 17th degree

08:17.000 --> 08:18.208
and furthermore--

08:19.291 --> 08:21.000
Oh, look, Tigger.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.208
Piglet's giving us a parade.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.583
Hey, Pigalet, old pal,

08:26.583 --> 08:28.875
can you help me
stop this choo-choo?

08:30.166 --> 08:32.000
We're gaining on them, Eeyore.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.458
Faster, faster.

08:33.458 --> 08:37.875
Maybe you'd like to change
places for a while.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
Never mind.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.333
Oh, dear. Perhaps this
wasn't such a smart idea.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.833
Faster, Eeyore, faster!

09:06.833 --> 09:08.166
Here it comes.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.375
I'll jump aboard
on a count of 7.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.375
1, 2, 3--

09:14.375 --> 09:17.375
Hello again, Piglet!

09:17.375 --> 09:19.583
4-- Oh, hello, Pooh.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.291
5!

09:21.291 --> 09:24.458
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

09:24.458 --> 09:25.500
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

09:27.375 --> 09:30.250
Oh, look.
Now Piglet's dancing.

09:33.708 --> 09:35.250
It's my only chance

09:35.250 --> 09:36.750
to stop the Hole
In the Head Gang

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
and prove my friend
Pooh is innocent.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.875
Only lead to trouble
and me getting hurt.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.875
Always does.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.708
Uh, Sheriff, how do you
slow this thing down?

10:04.083 --> 10:05.458
Tigger:
What am I gonna do?

10:05.458 --> 10:06.875
I've pulled every switch,

10:06.875 --> 10:08.125
I've switched every pull,

10:08.125 --> 10:09.708
and it still won't stop.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.083
Did you pull this one?

10:29.708 --> 10:31.875
Yahoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

10:37.291 --> 10:38.875
Yaah!

10:38.875 --> 10:41.291
Slow down!
Slow down! Ooh!

10:55.000 --> 10:57.166
- Yahoo-hoo-hoo!
- Hmm.

10:57.166 --> 11:01.750
- Sounds awfully familiar.
-

11:01.750 --> 11:04.000
Yaah!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.708
Suffering sagebrush!

11:09.708 --> 11:11.416
Get me off this thing!

11:24.291 --> 11:26.291
Look. My hat.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.166
Hey! Let go! What's going on?

11:35.333 --> 11:38.875
- Whoa!
-

11:38.875 --> 11:40.875
Bother!

11:44.583 --> 11:46.625
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:59.458 --> 12:01.708
What do you know.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.750
Didn't get the worst of it.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.000
Hawmp!

12:10.708 --> 12:11.875
Hello, Piglet.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.750
Nice of you to drop in.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.583
Pooh, you really did
take the train?

12:17.583 --> 12:20.708
You're--
You're a train robber.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.583
Now I have to take you in.

12:22.583 --> 12:26.375
I am? You do?

12:26.375 --> 12:28.125
Oh, bother.

12:28.125 --> 12:31.000
I suppose that's
why I'm wearing black.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.416
This is terribibble,
horribibble.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.416
They think
the pooh with a name

12:36.416 --> 12:38.208
is an outlaw.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.708
Gasp.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.291
They must think
I'm an outlaw, too.

12:42.291 --> 12:46.375
All I did was borrow
one eensy-weensy train.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.875
Well, at least
it's not a total loss.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.875
I got my hat back.
Hoo hoo hoo!

12:55.583 --> 12:58.416
Piglet: Oh, Pooh Bear,
why did you do it?

12:58.416 --> 13:00.750
I give up, Piglet.
Why did I do it?

13:02.333 --> 13:03.583
By the way,

13:03.583 --> 13:06.250
what exactly is it
that I did, exactly?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.625
You took a train
without asking.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.166
You-- You train-napper.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.583
How about an alibi?

13:13.583 --> 13:17.458
Why, thank you, Rabbit,
but I'm not sleepy yet.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.958
If you don't come up
with a good excuse,

13:19.958 --> 13:22.333
you'll have to face the judge.

13:30.291 --> 13:34.000
And guess who gets
to play the judge.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.583
Looks like there's
gonna be a swinging.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.000
A swinging?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.333
Oh, how wonderful.
Hoo hoo.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.166
I just love to swing.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.458
Oh, d-d-dear.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.125
Hello, tigger with no--

14:12.125 --> 14:13.208
name.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.708
Shh!
You'll wake the sheriff!

14:15.708 --> 14:17.083
I'm here to break you

14:17.083 --> 14:19.000
out of the grand slammer,
buddy boy.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Uh, perhaps I should stay.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.708
But you're innocent.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.833
You were just a witness
accomplice.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.000
I was the one
who borrowed the train.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Why, thank you, Tigger,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.708
but I believe I have
one of those guilty faces

14:33.708 --> 14:35.333
only a mother could love.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.875
Now let's go.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.875
We got to ride into the sunset

14:38.875 --> 14:41.583
and life in the happily
ever afterlife. Hoo!

14:44.166 --> 14:45.500
Goodbye, Piglet.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.625
I'm escaping now.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.208
That's nice.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.708
Goodbye, Pooh.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.375
Escaping? Oh, d-d-dear.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.000
You should have told them

15:00.000 --> 15:02.458
you had nothing to do
with the train-napping.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.000
But they all thought
I was guilty,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.583
and I didn't want
to let them down.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.708
I only meant
to borrow the train

15:09.708 --> 15:12.083
on account of because
no one would let me touch it.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.958
Maybe we should
turn ourselves in.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.583
Perhaps after swinging,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.875
we could get off
to a fresh start.

15:18.875 --> 15:22.458
--
I want to collect the reward.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.625
Nah. I feel bad
but not that bad.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.500
There's got to be another
way out of this.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.375
It's time we put
our thinking caps on.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.250
Think, think, think.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.333
Oh, bother.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.875
It's too bad we can't
just fix the train.

15:38.875 --> 15:42.250
What a terrifical idea,
buddy bear.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.750
If we fix the train, we won't
have to turn ourselves in.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.750
I came up
with a terrifical idea?

15:48.750 --> 15:52.958
Oh, my. This must
be a fantasy.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.083
This should be a cinch.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.166
Once we put the choo-choo
back on track,

15:58.166 --> 15:59.750
we'll be home free. Hoo!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.333
Bother.

16:03.333 --> 16:06.208
I've never been
very good at puzzles.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.333
There. Good as new,

16:09.333 --> 16:11.833
if your new isn't too good.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

16:11.833 --> 16:14.833
A piece of imperfection.

16:14.833 --> 16:19.166
Yes. And we only had
to use half the parts.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.958
Now let's
get out of here.

16:20.958 --> 16:23.166
We'll hide out,
then find the train,

16:23.166 --> 16:25.458
and we're home free.
Hoo hoo!

16:25.458 --> 16:28.208
They'll never find us
up here in the high country.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.291
Ohh!

16:30.333 --> 16:31.625
Stick 'em up, outlaws,

16:31.625 --> 16:32.875
if you please.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.000
I've got you covered.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.125
Maybe we should've headed
on into low country.

16:38.125 --> 16:42.458
I tell you, we put the whole
kit and caboose back together

16:42.458 --> 16:44.500
and left it right there.
Outlaw's honor.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
Then where is it now?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.250
Perhaps
we misplaced it.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.125
Oh, bother.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.375
And I was almost certain
it was there.

16:57.375 --> 16:58.708
I can't take it.

16:58.708 --> 16:59.875
I'm going stir crazy.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.833
I want out! Out, I tell you!

17:01.833 --> 17:03.833
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!

17:03.833 --> 17:07.375
But, Tigger,
we've only been in
here five minutes.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.833
Oh, yeah. Seems like six.

17:09.833 --> 17:14.833
Your life looks
even more depressing
than mine right now.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.000
Never thought I'd hear
myself hear that.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.708
I'm--

17:19.708 --> 17:22.708
I'm disappointed in you, Pooh.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.833
Me, too, Piglet.

17:24.833 --> 17:27.000
I shouldn't have done
what I did,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.583
even if I didn't
know what I did.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.875
Come on, go easy
on buddy bear, Sheriff.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.875
I think he ate too much honey
and couldn't help himself.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.083
I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

17:39.083 --> 17:42.416
You two are going to get
just what you deserve.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.708
Looks like there's going to
be a double swinging tonight.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.083
How wonderful.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.083
Do you think
I could go first?

17:57.083 --> 17:59.500
No. No. I cannot do it!

17:59.500 --> 18:01.875
I confess, Sheriff!
I did it!

18:01.875 --> 18:03.416
I'm the train-napper!

18:03.416 --> 18:04.958
Pooh had nothing
to do with it.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.958
You mean Pooh's innocent?

18:06.958 --> 18:10.250
Yes. He told me
not to take the train,

18:10.250 --> 18:11.750
but I wouldn't listen.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.291
He was just a fall bear
in all this.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.583
Oh, Pooh, I'm so glad

18:16.583 --> 18:19.750
you're not a low-down,
no-good, lousy train-napper.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.458
Why, thank you, Piglet.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.083
I'm glad to hear it, too.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.833
Yeah, but what happened
to the train, Tigger?

18:25.833 --> 18:29.291
It's not like it could have
just rolled off by itself.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.125
Yaah!

18:34.250 --> 18:35.625
Then again--

18:48.875 --> 18:51.875
Hmm. And not a cloud
in the sky.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.625
Oh, dear.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.000
Hey, what's all the ruckus?

19:14.166 --> 19:15.833
Yaah!

19:17.833 --> 19:20.458
Yaah!

19:21.833 --> 19:24.708
We've got to do something.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.458
You're right.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.625
So who wants to be
the new sheriff?

19:28.625 --> 19:31.375
No. I'll stop
the runaway choo-choo

19:31.375 --> 19:33.291
and bring back
my Pigalet pal

19:33.291 --> 19:35.000
dead or alive.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.291
Never known a train yet

19:37.291 --> 19:39.625
that could resist
following tracks.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.375
Now all we got to do

19:56.375 --> 19:59.708
is wait for the choo-choo
to run out of steam and stop.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.708
I give it
seven more days tops.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.708
Aah!

20:36.958 --> 20:38.750
- Piglet!
- Our sheriff!

20:38.750 --> 20:40.708
- I knew it would work.
- About time.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.000
Thank you for saving
my life, Tigger,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.250
and the town,

20:44.250 --> 20:46.500
even if it took you
two weeks to do it.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.458
Hey, don't mention it.
Hoo hoo!

20:49.458 --> 20:51.208
That's what tiggers
do the best.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.458
But Tigger's
still a train-napper.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.125
None of this
would have happened

20:55.125 --> 20:56.375
if it weren't for him.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.958
But he never meant
to train-nap.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.750
He only meant to train-borrow,

21:01.750 --> 21:04.083
and then it went
out of control.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.250
But borrowing without
asking is bad, too,

21:07.250 --> 21:10.291
especially when you don't
say please and thank you.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.875
I'm sorry.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.291
Give me another chance.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.625
Please?

21:14.625 --> 21:16.250
I promise I'll hang up

21:16.250 --> 21:17.708
my ice cream scoops for good.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.750
Tigger, we talked it over

21:28.750 --> 21:33.333
and decided to let you off
this time with a warning.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.625
And I was all set

21:35.625 --> 21:38.458
for a good swinging,
dag nabbit.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.000
Hi, guys. I see

21:42.000 --> 21:43.625
you didn't touch my train
while I was gone.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.583
And because
you were so good,

21:45.583 --> 21:48.166
I'm going to let you
operate the controls.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.625
And you, Tigger,
are first

21:50.625 --> 21:52.375
because you wanted it
so much.

21:52.375 --> 21:55.291
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut back.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.333
Hey. Anyone
want to go outside

21:57.333 --> 21:58.833
and play guess
who's sleeping?

21:58.833 --> 22:01.333
- Oh, how wonderful.
- Always cheating again.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.833
Can I borrow a pillow?

22:02.833 --> 22:05.458
Oh, well.
Hey, guys, wait for me.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.958
I want to play.
