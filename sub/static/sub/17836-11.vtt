00:01.201 --> 00:02.568
Stiles:
<i> Previously on</i> teen wolf...

00:03.336 --> 00:04.770
Somebody's gonna
remember me.

00:06.439 --> 00:07.673
I'll tear you
in half right now.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.375
Somehow I don't think
we're gonna hug this out.

00:12.779 --> 00:13.846
I didn't say it back.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.647
You don't have to.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.050
Scott: <i> I can't believe</i>
<i> we're not in high school</i>
<i> anymore.</i>

00:18.985 --> 00:20.252
Everything's changed.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.191
(Music playing)

00:55.789 --> 00:56.822
(Whistles)

00:56.824 --> 00:58.323
(Both grunting)

01:00.026 --> 01:02.161
Hey! Nice work, Diaz.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.629
Nolan, you stay in there.
You can take him.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.169
(Players cheering)

01:10.171 --> 01:11.804
Nice work.
That's the best shot
of pre-season.

01:11.806 --> 01:12.971
Thanks, coach.

01:12.973 --> 01:16.809
Assistant coach.
What exactly are you doing?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.410
Drills.
You're giving them hope.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.412
When did I ever
give you hope?

01:20.847 --> 01:22.514
Never.
Exactly.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.983
Nothing motivates more
than withering criticism.

01:24.985 --> 01:28.287
Speaking of, um, losers,
where's your, uh,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.122
where's your
little protege?

01:30.857 --> 01:32.124
Um...

01:32.126 --> 01:35.527
"Um"? Is...
Is "um" a location?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.062
Is "um" behind me?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.864
He'll be here. Okay?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.399
He's the backbone
of this team.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.401
He's stepped it up
in every way possible.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.502
A born leader who
can handle

01:43.504 --> 01:45.270
anything that
you throw at him.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.371
I can't handle this.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.140
Yes, you can.
And you've handled

01:48.142 --> 01:50.075
so much
worse than this.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.810
You're practically
the Alpha now.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.645
I'm nothing without her.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.747
Liam, can you help me
with this, please?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.283
Hayden left me.
She moved,

01:58.285 --> 01:59.451
to protect her sister.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.286
And it's not like she
dumped you or anything.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.155
Why is your arm
so heavy?

02:03.890 --> 02:05.023
(Phone beeps)

02:05.025 --> 02:06.925
Okay, Scott says
coach is losing it.

02:06.927 --> 02:07.993
Liam: Scott's leaving, too.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.662
Going to college
is not leaving, okay?

02:10.663 --> 02:13.565
And we're all gonna
be going to different
colleges eventually.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.000
I thought we were
both applying to ucla.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.201
What, you guys are going
to the same college?

02:16.203 --> 02:18.937
That is not the point.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.038
What is the point?

02:20.040 --> 02:23.242
The point is that
summer's almost over,

02:23.244 --> 02:24.643
we're about to be
seniors,

02:24.645 --> 02:27.446
this is about to be
the best year
of our entire lives,

02:27.448 --> 02:29.014
and you're still captain
of the lacrosse team.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.716
So come on. We got to...

02:32.552 --> 02:33.652
(Groans)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.154
I swear to god, McCall,

02:35.156 --> 02:37.456
if you don't get dunbar
out here in three,

02:37.458 --> 02:38.957
this'll be your last day
as assistant coach.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.926
This is my last day
as assistant coach.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.227
I can still dock your pay.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.096
I'm a volunteer.
You want my whistle?

02:44.098 --> 02:45.164
Who gave you a whistle?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.798
(Phone vibrating)

02:46.800 --> 02:48.267
(Music playing)

02:48.269 --> 02:49.668
Coach is making
Diaz captain.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.413
Oh, god. Oh, god.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.391
Now, that's how you
play lacrosse, McCall!

03:12.393 --> 03:14.960
Who is that kid?
He's spectacular.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.228
Scott: That's just Liam.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.296
Well, how the hell
am I supposed
to tell them apart?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.597
They're all wearing
the same thing.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.399
Scott: They've got numbers
on their jerseys, coach.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.367
(Groans)

03:23.336 --> 03:25.003
(Indistinct shouting)

03:25.005 --> 03:26.605
(Growling)

03:27.674 --> 03:28.974
(Whistling)

03:28.976 --> 03:30.742
(Music playing)

03:30.744 --> 03:32.344
(Growls)

03:32.346 --> 03:33.912
(Heavy breathing)

03:34.981 --> 03:37.349
Liam, your eyes.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.718
McCall, what
the hell was that?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.854
That wasn't a foul.
That's called winning.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.325
(Indistinct chatter)

04:03.576 --> 04:04.843
(Growling)

04:12.151 --> 04:13.452
Everyone back.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.995
(Growling)

04:26.933 --> 04:28.333
Nolan.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.872
Nolan, hey,
step back, man.
Are you okay?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.040
What are you doing?

04:38.778 --> 04:39.945
(Growling)

04:45.918 --> 04:47.519
(Whimpering)

05:18.718 --> 05:21.219
Liam: You think it's a,
a wolf-wolf or...

05:21.221 --> 05:22.654
Scott: I think
it's just a wolf.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.774
Scott.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.656
(Music playing)

06:29.789 --> 06:31.790
(Music playing)
Wolves or werewolves?

06:32.525 --> 06:34.025
They said wolves.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.560
Not interested.
You go. (Exhales)

06:35.562 --> 06:37.662
Liam was asking
for help from
the werecoyote,

06:37.664 --> 06:39.564
not the banshee.
Why me?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.166
Because you're
the former animal.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.169
Nobody understands
mysterious animal
situations like you do.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.639
I'm done with mysterious
animal situations.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.609
I want mysterious men.
French ones.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.512
Lydia: Your flight's delayed.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.447
No, no, it's rerouted.
There's a difference.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.416
Delayed is what happens
when your flight is rerouted.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.384
So you have
plenty of time to help.
(Computer beeps)

06:59.386 --> 07:02.521
Lydia: And there's a storm
system shutting down
Charles de gaulle airport.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.789
It's a minor shower.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.996
Liam's got
everything covered.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.397
They were just
dead wolves.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.099
Doesn't sound
supernatural to me.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.004
(Both grunt)

07:19.006 --> 07:20.772
Whatever happened
to those wolves was
definitely supernatural.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.340
Well, I wouldn't
say definitely.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.009
It could've been
a parasitic infection.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.610
I mean, we get dogs
that come into the clinic

07:25.612 --> 07:27.679
that have botflies
coming out of their skin.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.548
Can that happen
to people?
Yeah.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.816
Yeah, they crawl
under the skin,

07:30.818 --> 07:34.052
lay some eggs,
and eventually
they...

07:39.325 --> 07:40.625
Burst.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.130
(Sighs)

07:50.770 --> 07:52.370
So, you wanna
talk about it?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.372
I thought we were
talking about it.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.707
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.743
Oh. That.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.679
(Scoffs) Me.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.614
Yeah. You.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.886
Your fangs, your eyes,
the growl.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.323
Sounds like we're
gonna talk about this.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.791
You just gotta
remember your mantra.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.295
What three things
cannot long be hidden?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.831
I haven't had
to use that in...
Hey.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.666
What three things
cannot long be hidden?

08:23.703 --> 08:25.670
The sun, the moon,
the truth.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.106
Again.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.510
(Sighs)

08:32.211 --> 08:34.412
(Inhales deeply)
The sun...

08:34.414 --> 08:36.414
(Exhales)

08:36.416 --> 08:38.416
(Inhales deeply)
The moon...

08:38.418 --> 08:40.885
(Heart beating rapidly)

08:40.888 --> 08:42.687
(Inhales deeply)

08:43.089 --> 08:44.623
The truth.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.225
(Heartbeat slows)

08:48.060 --> 08:49.294
Better.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.733
You don't have
a suitcase, do you?

08:58.404 --> 08:59.771
I got duct tape.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.775
(Beeps)

09:03.777 --> 09:05.977
Look, all I'm telling
you is what I saw,
and I know what I...

09:05.979 --> 09:08.313
I'm telling you
what you saw
isn't possible.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.349
This patient's
been here since
the facility opened.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.451
Orderly: Didn't this
place open in 1912?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.053
Exactly.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.855
(Music playing)

09:16.857 --> 09:18.723
(Metal clanking)

09:23.429 --> 09:24.829
Dr. fenris: Come on.

09:26.465 --> 09:28.133
Take a closer look
at our friend.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.011
You see this?

09:40.013 --> 09:43.949
He's been covered
in pyroclastic rock
for decades.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.619
It's hardened
volcanic ash.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.859
(Thudding)

09:56.028 --> 09:57.662
(Cracking)

10:13.779 --> 10:17.382
Maybe, uh, I should lower
this a notch or two.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.790
(Gas hissing)

10:34.100 --> 10:36.201
(Orderly screaming)

10:41.607 --> 10:43.742
(Breathing heavily)

10:45.211 --> 10:46.811
(Fire crackling)

11:03.262 --> 11:04.763
(Roaring)

11:14.573 --> 11:16.141
(Indistinct chatter)

11:16.575 --> 11:18.176
(Music playing)

11:21.280 --> 11:23.348
Latin? You wanna
take Latin?

11:24.583 --> 11:25.817
I like Latin.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.887
Liam, who told you
to take Latin?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.655
(Sighs)

11:30.657 --> 11:32.557
Look, everyone says
it's an easy a,

11:32.559 --> 11:34.225
and my gpa sucks.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.828
Well, I applaud you
wanting to raise your gpa,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.730
especially while
applying to colleges.

11:38.732 --> 11:42.734
But easy is not the path
you should be taking.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.504
It... it's been a really
hard year for me.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.406
You want to talk
about your girlfriend,

11:48.408 --> 11:50.709
guidance hours
are posted.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.477
Let's talk about
your schedule.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.779
How does Spanish sound?

11:55.481 --> 11:57.082
<i> Bueno.</i>

11:57.084 --> 11:58.149
<i> Excelente.</i>

11:59.418 --> 12:01.486
As I said, I'm here
to guide you.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.756
Not push, not prod.
Guide.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.492
You think ap calculus is
a little out of my league?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.762
Look, I understand
the need to keep up,

12:10.764 --> 12:13.164
to be recognized
or noticed.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.668
Everybody feels
invisible sometimes.
I don't.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.636
The one thing
i never feel is invisible.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.105
I meant metaphorically.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.639
Literally, too.

12:21.641 --> 12:25.009
I'm here. Right here.
You can see me, right?

12:25.011 --> 12:27.679
Yes, I can see you, Corey.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.180
I've seen a lot of things
at this school,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.516
even when other people
have their eyes closed.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.051
Are you seeing
anything right now?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.688
Yes.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.123
I'm seeing
creative writing.

12:39.391 --> 12:40.992
Have you thought about that?

12:42.895 --> 12:44.763
Perfect, Mr. Hewitt.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.898
You've given this
a lot of thought.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.867
I give everything
a lot of thought.

12:48.869 --> 12:53.071
And yet, you've never come
into my office and shared
any of those thoughts.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.373
You think I should?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.743
I just want you to know that
I'm here for you guys.

12:58.745 --> 13:02.914
I know I haven't been
in the position
all that long, but...

13:02.916 --> 13:06.151
I also know that students
at this school have seen

13:06.153 --> 13:07.685
and been through
things that

13:07.687 --> 13:10.088
don't exactly come
with easy explanation.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.258
I'll keep that in mind.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.494
I take this
very seriously, Mason.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.764
Anything we talk
about in here

13:19.766 --> 13:21.833
stays between you and me.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.468
(Music playing)

13:24.403 --> 13:25.837
It won't go any further.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.438
Are we still talking about

13:27.440 --> 13:28.973
registering for classes?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.543
I'm talking about anything

13:31.545 --> 13:33.111
you need to talk about.

13:35.414 --> 13:36.714
I think I'm good.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.149
Thanks.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.119
Of course you are.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.194
Nolan,

13:49.196 --> 13:50.395
something tells me
you need to do

13:50.397 --> 13:52.430
more than just talk
about class schedule.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.701
Uh, it can wait.
(Chuckles)

13:56.703 --> 13:58.736
You're here now.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.171
There's still a lot
of people waiting.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.342
Was it the wolf
on the lacrosse field?

14:05.811 --> 14:06.978
Was it the other stuff

14:06.980 --> 14:08.880
we spoke about
over the summer?

14:10.983 --> 14:13.251
We can talk about what
happened in the library,

14:13.253 --> 14:14.652
if you want.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.887
The animal attack.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.188
Don't say that.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.427
Everybody says
"animal attack." But...

14:24.396 --> 14:27.966
Everybody knows that,
that was no animal.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.201
But last night, it was a wolf.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.604
Some kind of wolf.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.173
Some kind.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.176
What other kind of wolves
are there, Nolan?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.147
What kind of wolves
have you seen?

14:46.685 --> 14:48.119
(Sighs)

14:50.856 --> 14:54.325
There's this book,
<i> north American</i>
<i> cryptozoology,</i>

14:54.327 --> 14:57.061
and they have
this entire chapter
on spiders.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.530
And they even have
a section on scarabs, too.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.932
Liam: What's a scarab?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.567
Mason: Oh, you
don't wanna know.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.103
(Music playing)

15:06.071 --> 15:08.239
What happened to
all the books?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.308
Uh, maybe someone's
writing a paper

15:10.310 --> 15:12.777
on mythology
and superstition.
(Sighs)

15:12.779 --> 15:15.947
Or, like,
a hundred papers.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.882
(Woman screaming)

15:17.884 --> 15:20.351
Why does this keep
happening to our school?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.419
(People screaming)

15:21.820 --> 15:23.354
(Rats squeaking)

15:28.060 --> 15:30.061
(People continue screaming)

15:41.240 --> 15:43.274
(Muffled screams)
(Heart beating rapidly)

15:44.810 --> 15:47.345
(Heart beating rapidly)

15:47.880 --> 15:49.981
(Heart beating rapidly)

16:05.197 --> 16:06.664
It looks like we're gonna need

16:06.666 --> 16:08.199
a book on rats, too.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.143
(Music playing)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.579
Mason: You know, it's not
as irrational as you think.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.382
There's actually an
evolutionary advantage

16:24.384 --> 16:27.552
of having an innate
fear of spiders, snakes,

16:27.554 --> 16:28.619
and rats.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.589
How do you know
they came from here?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.424
Mason: Well, they came
clawing through the vents,

16:33.426 --> 16:36.661
and those pipes
lead directly down here.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.264
What is that?

16:50.743 --> 16:52.243
It's a rat king.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.552
(Music playing)

17:01.554 --> 17:06.023
A list, of
every supernatural
in beacon hills.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.759
Starting with
the high schoolers.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.426
Hmm. No, thanks.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.730
Mom.
Mmm-mmm.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.865
You know stuff.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.465
That means
you have to do stuff.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.502
I have an obligation
to educate,

17:17.503 --> 17:19.936
not eliminate all
the problems of beacon hills.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.406
I have to run a school,

17:21.407 --> 17:23.608
and you have to
go enroll in one.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.343
You know the saying,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.345
"if you see something,
say something."

17:27.347 --> 17:28.579
Please stop.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.082
Honey, I care about
you and your friends.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.118
But mostly,
i care about you.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.154
And you're going to be safe
3,000 miles away,

17:36.156 --> 17:38.122
so we don't have
to deal with this.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.192
(Exhales sharply)

17:41.194 --> 17:42.760
(Smacks lips)
I've got work to do.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.563
Mom.
It's not our
problem anymore.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.667
(Door closes)

17:55.974 --> 17:57.742
(Electricity crackling)

17:57.744 --> 17:59.410
(Sighs)

17:59.412 --> 18:02.980
Eight hundred
thousand volts sounds
pretty dangerous.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.882
Just use it on me.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.484
I'll be okay,
i promise.

18:07.986 --> 18:09.454
(Scoffs)

18:12.858 --> 18:14.325
(Exhales)

18:14.993 --> 18:17.428
(Growls)

18:17.430 --> 18:19.864
Mmm.
You have to hold
the button down.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.467
(Electricity crackling)

18:23.268 --> 18:25.536
I'm going to be fine,
Scott.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.172
And if something happens,
i will call Liam.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.176
(Stutters) What if
he's not around?

18:32.178 --> 18:33.878
You think that this thing
is gonna protect me?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.413
I'm a nurse.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.748
A stun Baton
isn't my thing.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.418
You have a thing?
Sort of.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.787
(Music playing)

18:44.923 --> 18:47.558
If something does happen
and people get hurt,
I've got it covered.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.197
(Stuttering) Where did
you get all this from?

18:53.199 --> 18:56.033
Scott, you have
orientation tomorrow.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.035
Classes to schedule.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.705
Cats and dogs
to heal at uc Davis.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.573
(Sighs)

19:03.942 --> 19:05.409
Worry about that.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.481
(Chuckles)

19:12.618 --> 19:14.218
(Inhales deeply)

19:15.521 --> 19:17.555
(Groans)
Oh!

19:17.557 --> 19:19.390
I held the button.
You held the button.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.758
Didn't I? Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.128
Malia: You've got two minutes.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.463
What do you think
happened?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.865
(Music playing)

19:27.867 --> 19:29.267
Rats freaked out,

19:29.269 --> 19:30.368
crawled all over each other,

19:30.370 --> 19:32.703
got their tails knotted up.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.672
Tore each other apart
trying to break free.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.209
Mason: You read up
on rat king?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.610
What's a rat king?

19:43.081 --> 19:44.315
Oh! I'm good.
Thank you.

19:44.317 --> 19:48.119
Yep. I'm, I'm good
just over here.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.488
Can you smell it?
It's fear.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.226
Yeah, it's the same
as the ones in
the math classroom.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.161
Why were there rats
in a classroom?

19:57.163 --> 20:00.097
Uh, they ran in
during second period,
uh, about 50 of them.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.332
Your two minutes are up.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.366
Liam: Where are you going?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.202
Paris. This isn't
my problem.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.469
So you think
this is a problem?

20:05.471 --> 20:07.271
Malia: Maybe. Probably.
But you've got it covered,

20:07.273 --> 20:08.806
and I've got a plane
to catch.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.974
I thought it was delayed?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.442
Malia: Rerouted.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.382
(Telephone ringing)

20:24.623 --> 20:26.357
(Music playing)

20:27.993 --> 20:29.694
(Radio static)

20:30.762 --> 20:32.363
(Indistinct radio chatter)

20:32.365 --> 20:33.998
Man: (Over radio)
<i> Available units,</i>
<i> we've got a report of</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:36.100
<i> a 11-80 at wabash...</i>

20:36.102 --> 20:38.035
Parrish: (Over radio)
<i> Highway patrol,</i>
<i> this is deputy Parrish,</i>

20:38.037 --> 20:40.004
<i> beacon hills</i>
<i> sheriff's department.</i>
<i> Already on scene.</i>

20:40.006 --> 20:43.274
<i> I'm looking at a 10-plus</i>
<i> vehicle pile-up.</i>
<i> Multiple injuries.</i>

20:43.276 --> 20:44.976
Man: (Over radio)
<i> Copy that, beacon hills.</i>

20:44.978 --> 20:46.510
<i> Medical is en route.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:56.921
(Sirens wailing)

20:56.923 --> 20:58.389
(Music playing)

20:58.391 --> 21:00.124
Laceration, room 4a.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.627
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over pa)

21:02.629 --> 21:05.162
Excuse me, sir.
If you wanna be treated,

21:05.164 --> 21:07.431
you have to sign in first.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.066
Man 1: No, you hit me,
dumbass.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.368
Man 2: Well,
you cut me off!

21:10.370 --> 21:11.602
You don't know
how to drive!
What are you talking...

21:11.604 --> 21:13.771
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Move away, both of you,

21:13.773 --> 21:17.041
right now, or you will be
the last to get treated.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.843
Parrish: You heard her.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.212
Parrish. Good, I need
another set of hands.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.880
Can you please keep these
two lovely gentlemen

21:22.882 --> 21:25.383
from killing each other
for the second time tonight?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.719
Man 1: Dumbass.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.389
Ms. McCall?
Yeah.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.026
Oh, my gosh.
You two brought me dinner?

21:35.028 --> 21:36.227
That's really nice.
No.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.628
It's not dinner.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.796
It's not dinner?

21:41.566 --> 21:43.868
(Exhales)
It's definitely not dinner.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.770
We were hoping you could
take a look at it for us.

21:45.772 --> 21:49.006
Well, I was hoping
that someone was going
to bring me dinner.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.076
Now is not the time
for a rat autopsy,

21:52.078 --> 21:54.145
so get this and
yourselves out of here.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.246
No, but we really...

21:55.248 --> 21:56.847
No. Out.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.483
Mason: Okay. All right.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.021
(Music playing)

22:22.074 --> 22:23.374
(Phone ringing)

(Heart beating rapidly)

22:52.871 --> 22:54.538
(Heart beating slowly)

22:54.540 --> 22:56.107
You started it.
Back off...

22:56.109 --> 22:57.274
Hey, now, that's
called assault!

22:57.276 --> 22:58.409
Can I get security over here?

22:58.411 --> 22:59.643
Oh, really?
Assault? Assault?
Yeah.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.679
Sir, you need to
calm down... (Grunts)

23:02.881 --> 23:04.281
(Growling)

23:04.283 --> 23:05.816
(Music playing)

23:06.418 --> 23:07.685
What the... what...

23:11.456 --> 23:12.957
Man 1: He's the one
who started it!

23:13.325 --> 23:14.592
(Panting)

23:16.628 --> 23:18.162
(Panting)

23:18.164 --> 23:20.631
The sun, the moon,
the truth.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.537
The sun, the moon...

23:28.640 --> 23:30.541
(Panting heavily)
The sun...

23:31.476 --> 23:32.843
The truth.
(Elevator dings)

23:37.349 --> 23:39.049
(Growls)

23:39.051 --> 23:40.584
(Growls)

23:44.389 --> 23:47.158
(Panting)
The sun, the moon,

23:47.926 --> 23:49.093
the truth.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.564
(Grunts)

23:54.065 --> 23:56.934
Scott? You ready?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.469
(Music playing)

24:01.106 --> 24:02.173
Scott?

24:16.888 --> 24:18.556
(Scuttling)

24:34.473 --> 24:36.073
(Telephone rings)
(Gasps)

(Scuttling)

25:41.106 --> 25:42.740
(Woman screams)

25:54.819 --> 25:56.020
(Crackling)

26:02.060 --> 26:03.294
(Metal door clanks)

26:03.296 --> 26:05.162
(Horse neighs)

26:05.164 --> 26:06.630
(People screaming)

26:11.002 --> 26:12.970
(Rapid gunshots)
(People screaming)

26:25.617 --> 26:27.751
Halwyn: <i> You let it out.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:31.021
<i> It was supposed to ride</i>
<i> with the hunt forever.</i>

(Panting)

26:40.365 --> 26:42.032
(Breath trembling)

26:57.682 --> 26:59.783
Hey, what'd you do
with that rat?

26:59.785 --> 27:02.386
I lost it
in the fight.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.520
(Exhales)

27:03.522 --> 27:04.788
Melissa's
gonna kill us.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.757
I don't think we can
ever go back there again.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.727
Yeah. That might
work for you,
but what about me?

27:09.729 --> 27:11.929
It could be a problem.
Mason: Yeah.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.801
(Music playing)

27:35.687 --> 27:37.221
(Music playing)

27:42.494 --> 27:43.961
What are you?

27:45.597 --> 27:47.865
(Growls softly)

27:48.400 --> 27:50.100
You know what I am.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.637
I'm the same as you.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.873
Okay, then what are
you here for?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.741
What are you protecting?

27:58.843 --> 28:00.411
Or is it something
you're hunting?

28:01.479 --> 28:03.213
Something that got away?

28:03.648 --> 28:05.282
(Door opens)

28:11.656 --> 28:13.424
(Growls softly)

28:15.293 --> 28:17.294
Something you let out.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.831
It must be stopped.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.036
Is he talking to you?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.237
I hope not.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.406
(Growls)

28:30.542 --> 28:32.843
(Fire crackling)

28:34.345 --> 28:35.713
Get behind me.

28:35.715 --> 28:36.980
Wait, that's a...

28:36.982 --> 28:38.048
Hellhound.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.753

(Groans)

29:54.759 --> 29:55.959
(Chuckles)

29:55.961 --> 29:57.694
Run!
Wait, I'm not
leaving you!

29:57.696 --> 29:59.263
No, he's
a hellhound! Run!

30:01.132 --> 30:02.232
(Growls)

30:08.706 --> 30:09.973
(Growling)

30:15.980 --> 30:19.383
If the wild hunt couldn't
keep you, nothing can.

30:21.252 --> 30:26.390
(Heart beating rapidly)
No. (Growls)

30:26.392 --> 30:27.891
No. No, it's not you.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.295
(Growls)

30:32.831 --> 30:35.065
(Sizzling)

30:47.212 --> 30:48.278
(Liam grunts)

30:51.583 --> 30:52.883
(Liam groans)

30:56.354 --> 30:57.921
(Slashing)

31:05.630 --> 31:07.397
(Both groaning)

31:08.700 --> 31:11.068
(Breath trembling)

31:12.737 --> 31:14.571
(Laughs)

31:14.573 --> 31:16.240
(Sighs)

31:17.475 --> 31:19.910
It won't stay hidden.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.579
(Breathing heavily)

31:25.383 --> 31:27.584
It must be stopped.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.956
Nothing else matters.

31:36.661 --> 31:38.195
(Groans)

31:39.530 --> 31:41.598
(Panting)

31:43.401 --> 31:44.601
The sun.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.505
The moon.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.576
The truth.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.211
Liam?

31:56.214 --> 31:57.281
(Groans)

32:05.857 --> 32:07.357
(Music playing)

32:15.667 --> 32:17.100
What the...

32:20.605 --> 32:21.939
(Chuckles)

32:28.947 --> 32:30.681
(Engine stalling)

32:32.650 --> 32:34.184
Oh, come on.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.455
Whoa.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.490
We can't leave.

32:45.997 --> 32:47.564
Mason: I got you.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.366
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.068
(Both panting)

32:54.739 --> 32:56.006
(Groans)

33:01.079 --> 33:02.679
It should be healing
faster than this.

33:02.681 --> 33:07.985
It's hellfire. I mean,
all things considered,
you're doing great.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.554
Well, great isn't supposed
to look like this.

33:10.556 --> 33:14.958
You fought a hellhound
on your own, without Scott.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.693
I don't know when
I'll get used to that.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.262
(Music playing)

33:19.664 --> 33:20.731
(Liam groans)

33:22.667 --> 33:25.002
Wounds heal.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.572
People move.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.541
Things change.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.878
Yeah.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.480
But it still hurts, though.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.085
(Gulps)

33:43.654 --> 33:45.155
(Keyboard clacking)

33:46.524 --> 33:47.724
<i> Oui, oui!</i>

33:50.061 --> 33:52.195
No! No, no,
no, no, no, no.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.064
It's just rats.
Rats and wolves,

33:54.066 --> 33:56.666
and maybe
a little bug problem.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.835
We need you.
And I need Paris.

33:58.837 --> 34:02.139
Paris has been around
for 2,000 years.
It's not going anywhere.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.207
(Music playing)

34:05.910 --> 34:07.044
Malia.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.245
Liam and
Mason called.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.047
Yeah. They've
got it covered.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.681
We can't make you stay,
and I don't wanna try.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.719
But we were hoping that
maybe you would want to.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.820
Well, I don't.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.056
Okay.

34:28.966 --> 34:30.233
(Sighs)

34:40.277 --> 34:42.112
What are we
supposed to do?

34:43.047 --> 34:44.781
Find a hellhound.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.083
(Music playing)

34:46.085 --> 34:47.350
(Gasping)

34:50.521 --> 34:51.855
(Groaning)

34:56.127 --> 34:58.795
We opened a door
to another world.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.530
And something came
out with us.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.999
Now we need
the hellhound to stop it.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.501
(Growls)

35:05.036 --> 35:06.536
(Music playing)

35:13.411 --> 35:14.711
(Twigs snap)

35:14.713 --> 35:15.812
(Grunts)

35:20.818 --> 35:24.154
So we put it back.
We've put things
back before.

35:28.526 --> 35:29.693
Why are you two looking
at each other like

35:29.695 --> 35:31.161
there's something you know
that I don't know?

35:31.163 --> 35:32.462
It might not be
that simple.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.297
We saved stiles,
we brought everyone back,

35:34.299 --> 35:37.901
but that's not the way
it's supposed to happen.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.036
There is always
a price to pay.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.638
We learned that
from the nemeton.

35:43.007 --> 35:45.142
What kind of price?
A big price?

35:46.777 --> 35:47.878
Big.

35:49.213 --> 35:50.514
Halwyn: <i> You let it out.</i>

35:51.782 --> 35:52.849
(Roars)

35:53.484 --> 35:54.684
(Grunts)

36:02.827 --> 36:04.528
(Music playing)

36:04.530 --> 36:05.595
(Growls)

36:12.603 --> 36:15.205
Okay. We should move
pretty quickly.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.740
Do we even know
what we let out?

36:17.775 --> 36:20.076
This hellhound might be
the only one who does.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.745
(Growling in distance)

36:26.817 --> 36:28.818
(Roars)

36:29.921 --> 36:31.087
(Grunts)

36:31.089 --> 36:32.489
(Groans)

36:32.491 --> 36:33.557
(Panting)

36:34.458 --> 36:35.525
(Groans)

36:43.067 --> 36:44.801
(monroe screams)

36:55.746 --> 36:57.380
(Growls)

37:23.274 --> 37:25.342
I thought you couldn't
kill a hellhound.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.421
Argent.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.627
Then it's true.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.961
Then what's true?

37:47.565 --> 37:49.432
What else
did you hear?

37:51.769 --> 37:53.903
(Panting)

37:54.906 --> 38:00.310
Lydia: <i> The sound of people</i>
<i> who've never lifted a hand</i>
<i> against another human being.</i>

38:06.684 --> 38:08.585
Scott:
<i> Something was killing them?</i>

38:10.688 --> 38:12.689
They were killing
each other.

38:24.902 --> 38:26.202
In case
anyone forgot...

38:26.204 --> 38:28.638
(Chuckles)
Yeah, I just said
"forgot".

38:28.640 --> 38:30.507
...we almost
lost him last time.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.377
If this turns out to be
something big,
and we don't call him...

38:34.379 --> 38:36.112
He would kill us.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.815
Malia: Or maybe we should
go back to the woods tonight
and find the killer.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.016
Scott?

38:41.285 --> 38:43.620
You guys didn't
hear his voice.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.689
He sounded really
excited to be there.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.224
Uh, just play
the voicemail.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.893
(Music playing)

38:50.696 --> 38:53.863
Stiles: <i> Hey, Scott.</i>
<i> So, I'm here.</i>

38:53.865 --> 38:56.766
<i> I'm in Quantico, Virginia,</i>
<i> at the FBI.</i>

38:56.768 --> 38:59.436
<i> I'm at the freaking FBI.</i>
<i> It's real. I'm really here.</i>

38:59.438 --> 39:02.906
<i> Uh, I kind of told Lydia</i>
<i> that I miss her and I can't</i>
<i> wait to get home, but...</i>

39:02.908 --> 39:05.041
<i> Listen, Scott, whatever</i>
<i> you're doing right now,</i>

39:05.043 --> 39:07.510
<i> just make sure you're still</i>
<i> getting out of beacon hills.</i>

39:07.512 --> 39:09.512
<i> I mean, maybe you think</i>
<i> you can't leave, you know,</i>

39:09.514 --> 39:11.281
<i> like, the whole thing</i>
<i> falls apart if</i>
<i> you're not there.</i>

39:11.283 --> 39:13.750
<i> Which I get,</i>
<i> but you have to.</i>

39:13.752 --> 39:17.787
<i> so if you don't call me back,</i>
<i> just promise me you're</i>
<i> actually going.</i>

39:17.789 --> 39:19.989
<i> Just get in the Jeep</i>
<i> and go.</i>

39:21.792 --> 39:23.727
(Music playing)

39:33.037 --> 39:36.439
FBI instructor:
<i> You'll find three words</i>
<i> on the official FBI seal,</i>

39:37.408 --> 39:41.478
<i> "loyalty, courage,</i>
<i> integrity."</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:44.848
<i> These are the qualities</i>
<i> we expect of all our interns,</i>

39:44.850 --> 39:49.586
<i> the qualities we demand</i>
<i> of you during</i>
<i> your 6 months with us.</i>

39:49.588 --> 39:53.957
Loyalty, courage,
integrity.
(Mouthing)

39:53.959 --> 39:57.560
You'll join actual
federal agents as
we investigate everything

39:57.562 --> 40:00.063
from white-collar crime
to terrorism...

40:00.065 --> 40:01.564
International and domestic?

40:02.133 --> 40:03.500
Uh,

40:03.901 --> 40:05.835
yes, exactly.

40:05.837 --> 40:10.173
We're also part of task forces
to catch kidnappers,
murderers...

40:10.175 --> 40:11.608
Serial killers?

40:12.576 --> 40:14.511
Yes, even serial killers.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.012
Sorry, I'll raise
my hand, you know.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.280
I'm sorry. Keep going.

40:17.282 --> 40:18.681
(Water slushing)

40:18.683 --> 40:22.285
One recent manhunt had our
crisis response team

40:22.287 --> 40:25.588
chasing down a bizarrely
feral unsub

40:25.590 --> 40:28.124
in the wilderness
of north Carolina.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.464
Is there a problem, uh,

40:37.101 --> 40:38.168
young man?

40:39.970 --> 40:41.438
No. Sorry, uh...

40:41.440 --> 40:43.506
Just got a little excited.
No problem.

40:43.508 --> 40:47.444
Little question, though,
that guy up there,
what's, uh, he wanted for?

40:47.912 --> 40:49.045
Murder.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.648
Is, uh...

40:53.551 --> 40:57.020
Sorry. Just what kind of,
uh, murder, exactly?

40:58.088 --> 40:59.489
Mass murder.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.591
(Music playing)

41:11.502 --> 41:12.969
(Music playing)
