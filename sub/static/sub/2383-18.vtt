00:01.734 --> 00:04.431
<i>Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle.</i>

00:04.537 --> 00:06.903
<i>You never really know</i>
<i>what's going on in there.</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:10.499
<i>So after Uncle Marshall lost his father,</i>
<i>he decided to get his heart checked.</i>

00:10.610 --> 00:12.510
<i>And so did I.</i>

00:12.612 --> 00:14.273
<i>And so did Lily.</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.645
<i>And so did Robin.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:20.015
<i>And then Marshall went again,</i>
<i>just to be sure.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:22.020
<i>There was only one holdout.</i>

00:22.122 --> 00:24.647
I don't need to go
to a heart doctor.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.056
I drink every day,
I sleep three hours every night...

00:27.160 --> 00:28.855
and I have multiple sex partners.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.725
I'm doing everything right.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.731
Barney, this is important.
We need you around for a long time.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.564
Without you, we'd have to find some other
sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.332
Actually, I'm thinking
about getting a dog again.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.671
- Oh, can she?
Can she get a dog? Please, Ted.
- No!

00:43.777 --> 00:46.177
If you get a dog, I'm gonna be
the one stuck taking care of it.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.713
- You wouldn't have to take care of it.
- Really?

00:48.815 --> 00:51.943
And who watered the philodendron
on your bookcase and sang it back to life?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.520
Yeah. That was made
out of silk, Ted.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.249
Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed
something that buries a bone.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.224
But I'm not talking about a dog.
I'm talking about a man.

01:00.326 --> 01:04.694
- Here we go.
- You're clearly trying to fill a hole. In her heart.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.494
You feel like the seventh wheel because now
Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora...

01:07.600 --> 01:09.067
and Lily's with Big Fudge.

01:09.169 --> 01:12.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge.

01:12.539 --> 01:16.498
"With?"
I am not "with" Nora.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.372
Wrong preposition.

01:18.478 --> 01:21.106
Later tonight, I'm hoping
to be <i>on</i> Nora. Right?

01:21.214 --> 01:22.579
Or <i>under</i> Nora. Right?

01:22.682 --> 01:25.515
Or... We're all adults.
I'll just say it.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.643
<i>Behind</i> Nora.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.052
I don't know.
This will be your second date.

01:30.156 --> 01:33.216
Oh! Barney's
got feelings for a girl.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.295
Yeah. Penis feelings.
Because she's hot.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.229
Guys, as you know,
I only have one rule.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.061
<i>Barney said this a lot.</i>

01:41.167 --> 01:42.794
I only have one rule.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.861
If you're gonna get it on in a porta-potty,
do it early in the day.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.770
I only have one rule.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.572
Never screw over a girl
whose last name ends in a vowel...

01:52.679 --> 01:54.544
'cause she's got brothers.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.842
I only have one rule.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.647
Never date a girl
with a hook for a hand.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.654
Never go out with the same girl
more than once.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.623
Then why are you going out
with Nora again?

02:07.727 --> 02:09.455
There is an exception.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.621
<i>And it was always the same exception.</i>

02:11.731 --> 02:13.858
Unless she's hot.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.798
Unless she's hot.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.802
Unless she's hot.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.936
And she is indeed hot...

02:22.041 --> 02:24.202
which is why nothing...

02:24.310 --> 02:25.971
not even God himself...

02:26.079 --> 02:27.774
Yeah, I said it, beardy...

02:27.881 --> 02:31.681
is gonna stand in the way
of tonight being legen...

02:31.784 --> 02:33.479
Wait for it.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.290
Uh-oh.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.337 --> 02:52.964
- Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late.
- Hey!

02:53.072 --> 02:54.835
I'm just getting over a cold.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.341
- Oh, no. How long have you been sick?
- About 20 minutes.

02:57.443 --> 03:00.640
- Can't seem to shake it.
- Okay. 'Cause I was gonna say
you look a little, um...

03:00.747 --> 03:03.443
Handsome? Rich?
Well-endowed?

03:06.753 --> 03:10.189
Uh, let's say well-endowed...
with phlegm.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.585
All right, let's go.
It's bedtime.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.252
The bed.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.887
That's where all the...

03:20.733 --> 03:22.166
happens.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.758
Come on.
Let's get you sorted out.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.101
<i>That night,</i>
<i>Barney didn't take care of business.</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:30.142
<i>Instead, Nora took care of Barney.</i>

03:44.991 --> 03:47.459
- Good night, Barney.
- Good night, Mommy.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.025
- Wow. She nursed you back to health?
- No.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.621
I didn't even see her boobs.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.361
She just took care of me.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.937
Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.699
- Nate, these are my friends.
- What's up, guys?

04:00.807 --> 04:03.002
Nate Scooberman,
but everyone calls me Scooby.

04:03.109 --> 04:05.543
Uh, I'd love to hang out,
but I really gotta hit the john.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.375
Uh, yeah. It's right in there, Scooby.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.075
Thanks, brah.
I like you guys.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.550
Oh, Robin.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.713
If you weren't so much stronger than me,
I would slap you.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.757
What? You told me
to meet someone.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.850
I know.
And look, he seems plenty nice.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.987
But I didn't mean bring home
the first guy you bump into on the street.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.498
Actually, I met him in the park.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.091
Should've just let you get a dog.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.695
Oh, I should go.
Lily, can I talk to you for a second?

04:35.908 --> 04:38.934
So, um, I made an appointment
with that cardiologist.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.775
Aw, and you want me to go with you
'cause you're a little scared?

04:41.881 --> 04:43.246
No.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.749
Do you want me to go with you
because you're a <i>lot</i> scared?

04:45.852 --> 04:48.218
- Yes!
- Okay, fine.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.016
On one condition.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.115
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.387
She seems like something special.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.862
Okay. I promise I won't lie to her.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.593
I may, however, lie <i>on</i> her.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.601
# I said a-bang-bang
bangity-bang #

05:03.703 --> 05:07.264
# I said a-bang-bang, bangity-bang
bang-bang, bangity-bang #

05:07.373 --> 05:08.840
Are we done?

05:10.510 --> 05:12.341
# A-bang-bang, bangity-bang ##

05:12.445 --> 05:15.312
- Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.
- See, Lily?

05:15.415 --> 05:16.814
She was worried.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.282
Although it seems like
you might have a slight arrhythmia.

05:19.385 --> 05:22.115
Ow! Nails! Nails!

05:22.221 --> 05:23.950
It's probably nothing
to worry about, but...

05:24.057 --> 05:25.649
I'd like you to wear
this heart monitor...

05:25.758 --> 05:27.225
for the next 24 hours.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.660
Twent... Flag on the play.
Doc, I have a date tonight.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.230
Don't worry.
It's totally safe.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.856
Unless part of
your big date involves...

05:33.966 --> 05:35.558
connecting yourself
to a car battery.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.102
Well, now it doesn't.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.935
<i>Exactly 24 hours later,</i>
<i>they returned for the results.</i>

05:43.042 --> 05:45.636
Okay, everything
looks fine here.

05:45.745 --> 05:50.205
Although I did notice a few irregularities,
there's nothing to be...

05:52.352 --> 05:53.649
alarmed about.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.111
Go on, Doctor.

05:56.222 --> 06:00.181
What happened at 8:46 p.m.
last night?

06:00.293 --> 06:03.387
Well, let's see.
Uh, <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

06:03.496 --> 06:06.488
Naked push-ups. Naked chin-ups.
I was at dinner.

06:06.599 --> 06:11.366
This might be a little forward, but do you
have a bomb strapped to your chest?

06:11.471 --> 06:12.870
This? No. No.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.099
It's a...
a heart monitor.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.403
- It's a medical thing.
- Oh.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.604
I'm so sorry. I've been trying
not to stare at your chest all night.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.704
What's that like?

06:22.815 --> 06:24.715
So, is everything okay?

06:24.817 --> 06:28.184
My friend's dad passed away
from a sudden heart attack...

06:28.287 --> 06:30.687
so I'm just getting myself
checked out too.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.621
Oh, I am so sorry.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.020
Thanks.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.264
Uh, Barney, what I'm about to say...

06:40.366 --> 06:42.027
is gonna sound a little weird...

06:42.135 --> 06:46.196
but I think I'm starting to like you,
so I have to say it.

06:46.305 --> 06:48.933
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm not easily shocked.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.408
Unless you dump water on me, 'cause
I'll just...

06:52.512 --> 06:53.809
No, what is it?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.437
I want to get married.

06:55.548 --> 06:59.314
I mean, not tonight,
or even to you necessarily.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.284
But that's what I want.

07:01.387 --> 07:05.153
And if that's gonna scare you off,
then I'd rather it scare you off now.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.488
I want a family.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.993
And I want to live in a little house
with a garden...

07:10.096 --> 07:12.326
and a tree for the kids to climb.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.061
And I want to go to sleep every night
with the same person by my side...

07:16.169 --> 07:19.605
and wake up next to him in the morning,
every morning, for the rest of our lives.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.574
Just thought you should know that.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.769
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora!

07:30.216 --> 07:33.083
That's exactly what I want too.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.493
I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels
keep messing with my tomatoes.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.086
Every time I see 'em in the backyard,
I'm, like, "Get outta here!"

07:45.198 --> 07:48.190
They run off, but sure enough,
a few minutes later there they are again.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.270
And I'm like, "Get outta here!"
So annoying.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.304
I smell food.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.204
Does this place have a kitchen?
I'll be right back.

07:57.677 --> 08:02.376
Okay, but you have to admit
that he is a lot of fun.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.110
Oh, I actually think
he's quite intelligent for what he is.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.947
- And what is he?
- He's a dog.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.022
- He's totally a dog.
- What? You saw him hitting on someone?

08:10.122 --> 08:12.022
No, no. I didn't say
"He a dawg."

08:12.124 --> 08:14.558
I said, "He's a dog,"
as in a <i>dog.</i>

08:14.660 --> 08:17.720
I think we've all noticed
a few curious mannerisms.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.958
Or, uh, rather, dog-erisms.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.968
Uh, Scooby, the tag's
still on your jeans.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.537
Where?

08:33.946 --> 08:35.573
Okay, Scooby.
You ready?

08:37.416 --> 08:40.214
- Ohh!
- Good boy, Scooby!

08:40.318 --> 08:41.980
Good job, Scoob.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.488
That last one
did not happen.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.818
- Okay, you're right.
- He dropped it.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.654
He's not a dog.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.558
Robin, it's fine. You said
you wanted a dog, and you got one.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.097
And the best part is
he got his shots.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.666
Hey, guys.
Got my shots.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.099
- You are so playful.
- Nice job fetching those.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.103
- Guys.
- Yeah, guys, cut it out.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.435
Scooby, sit.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.671
So, Scooby, if you're gonna be hanging out
with our Robin, you should be properly <i>vetted.</i>

09:05.778 --> 09:09.839
Uh, yeah. And we hope our nosiness
doesn't give you <i>pause.</i>

09:09.949 --> 09:11.382
How did you meet?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.349
- Tell us the <i>tale.</i>
- Yes, how did you <i>whisk her</i> off her feet?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.716
- <i>Shed</i> a little light on the matter.
- Did you send her an e-mail?

09:15.821 --> 09:18.381
- Or did you <i>call 'er?</i>
- Guys, stop <i>hounding</i> him.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.692
Oh, geez.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.489
No, you're right, Robin.
We don't want your new guy to <i>flee.</i>

09:23.596 --> 09:26.292
We're just trying to make sure
he's not a <i>heel.</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:29.232
So, moving from Canada,
that transition must've been pretty <i>rough.</i>

09:29.335 --> 09:32.031
Sure was. My part of Canada's
pretty different from New York.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.538
Oh, I bet it was
an <i>incredible journey.</i>

09:34.640 --> 09:36.574
What part of Canada
is that? Speak.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.769
Labrador.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.641
This isn't happening.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.010
Hey, Nate, why don't you go play
some music on the jukebox.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.878
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, shoot.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.975
- Dropped my keys.
- I'll get 'em.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.879
Hey, guys.
This is Nora.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.980
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.116
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.626
We were just passing by,
and I wanted to pop in for two reasons.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.721
First, I wanted to let you know that your friend
Barney is being a perfect gentleman.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.390
Well, it's still early.

10:01.500 --> 10:05.334
I'm being serious. I had no idea
that deep down he's such a romantic.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.633
I had no idea
he had a deep down.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.571
Oh, you should've
heard him at dinner.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.303
I mean, I like being single...

10:12.411 --> 10:15.903
but, secretly,
I want to have kids.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.779
- How many do you want?
- Three. One of each.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.075
- You?
- Three.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.748
- All in an old stone house.
- Yeah, with ivy growing on it.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.917
- Cocktails on the patio.
- And we must have a pool.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.358
We?

10:31.030 --> 10:32.588
Pool sounds brilliant.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.660
Are you for real, Barney?

10:36.702 --> 10:39.102
I really am.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.605
- Unbelievable.
- I know. Right?

10:41.707 --> 10:44.801
And the second reason we popped in
is 'cause I need to use the loo.

10:44.910 --> 10:48.607
But when I get back, I'm dying
to hear all about Mr. Softy here.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.649
I assure you, that's
not a nickname that l...

10:53.052 --> 10:56.783
And that explains
your 14-second cardiac arrest.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.954
Barney, you promised
you wouldn't lie.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.459
I'm not lying.

11:02.561 --> 11:05.189
Guys, Nora's really special.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.356
In fact, I think I'm...

11:08.467 --> 11:10.458
falling in love with her.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.503
Guys, I'm serious!

11:15.608 --> 11:18.805
I'm not gonna let you do this. When Nora
gets back here, I'm blowin' the whistle.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.243
Just make sure it's not
a high-frequency whistle...

11:21.347 --> 11:23.713
because we don't want
to torture Robin's boyfriend.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.215
Guys, this is real.

11:25.317 --> 11:28.081
And if you don't make me
look good in front of Nora...

11:28.187 --> 11:31.987
just remember, I have got dirt on
each of you and I am not afraid to spill it.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.992
Barney, you can't blackmail us
into lying to Nora.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.220
Really, Lily?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.956
Even if I were to mention...
oh, I don't know...

11:39.065 --> 11:41.226
your kindergarten class's
pet guinea pig?

11:41.333 --> 11:42.891
Mr. Buttons!

11:43.002 --> 11:45.232
You son of a bitch!

11:45.337 --> 11:46.929
Fine.
I'll be nice.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.007
- Marshall?
- You got nothin' on me.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.939
- The calzone?
- Checkmate.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.137
- Robin?
- Don't say the Mr. T dream.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.441
Don't say the Mr. T dream.
Don't say the Mr. T dream.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.416
The Mr. T dream.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.349
- Ted?
- Go ahead.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.945
Give me your best.
My life's an open book.

12:04.056 --> 12:07.514
- The ballet class.
- I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.959
- The 'N Sync concert.
- 1998, Cleveland's Gund Arena.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.531
Front row. Caught J.C.'s shirt.
What else ya got?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.035
Okay, Ted.
The thermos.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.128
I suppose it's possible Barney
has real feelings for Nora.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.639
I do! So be cool.

12:24.510 --> 12:28.207
There's a man back there who seems
fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.610
Sorry, toots.
He's taken.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.551
So, how do you all
know Barney?

12:34.653 --> 12:36.553
Oh, I don't know.
How do we know Barney?

12:36.655 --> 12:39.215
How does anyone know
how they know anyone?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.589
I like your pretty hair.
Help me.

12:41.694 --> 12:45.653
We did not meet him
at a strip club. No, sir.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.327
Because... Barney don't
go to no strip clubs.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.064
- Oh, come on. Barney's been
to a strip club once.
- Once?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.969
- Thermos.
- Nope. Not even once.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.666
Really?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.801
So Barney really is
a genuinely nice guy?

13:04.150 --> 13:05.549
I don't recall.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.551
Okay, I think that we're done here.

13:07.653 --> 13:11.020
I think that we have
adequately established that Barney is...

13:11.123 --> 13:14.149
the kind of guy that you would bring home
to meet your parents.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.251
Okay, so let's just drop it.
All right?

13:16.362 --> 13:17.761
That's funny
you should say that...

13:17.863 --> 13:20.161
because, as it happens,
my parents are in town.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.166
They're only here,
like, once a year.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.101
We're getting brunch tomorrow.
Do you want to meet them?

13:25.204 --> 13:27.365
<i>This was a big deal for Barney.</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:29.771
I only have one rule.

13:29.875 --> 13:33.971
Never, ever, ever
meet a girl's parents.

13:35.447 --> 13:39.440
- Not even if she's hot?
- Not even if her mom's hot.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.952
I'd love to meet your parents.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.948
It's a date.
We should get going.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.151
- Walk me home?
- Walk? Somebody say walk?

13:48.260 --> 13:50.626
- I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.
- No, Scooby.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.663
You, uh, <i>stay.</i>

13:57.169 --> 13:59.069
Oh, no. I got called
back into work.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.639
Can you keep an eye on him
until I get back?

14:01.740 --> 14:04.436
- He's new to the city
and he doesn't really know anyone.
- I knew it.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.740
- I knew, if you got a dog,
I'd wind up taking care of it.
- He's not a...

14:07.847 --> 14:08.973
Stop it!

14:09.081 --> 14:10.912
Good night.

14:13.252 --> 14:13.352
What do we do now?
Oh! I got an idea.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.651
What do we do now?
Oh! I got an idea.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.519
I was in the park today,
and this guy sold me a big bag of...

14:19.625 --> 14:22.594
<i>Kids, it was a big bag</i>
<i>of sandwiches.</i>

14:22.695 --> 14:25.323
- Whoa!
- Put that away.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.922
- You guys wanna fire these up?
- Scooby, we're in our 30s.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.092
We don't smoke
sandwiches anymore.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.170
- Sandwich brownies?
- Okay.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.237
Sandwiches make me hungry.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.604
Truth.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.008
- Hey, I have a question.
- Yeah?

14:40.112 --> 14:44.048
What did Barney mean
when he said "calzone"?

14:45.584 --> 14:47.711
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- Okay.

14:47.820 --> 14:52.348
One time Barney saw me drop
a calzone on the sidewalk...

14:52.458 --> 14:54.722
pick it up and then keep eating it.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.853
- It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
- Dude.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.590
Listen to me.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.791
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.892
That calzone sounds amazing.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.874
Guys, I found this on the floor.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.739
Oh, my God.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.574
Scooby ate the whole tray.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.942
Ruh-roh!

15:16.882 --> 15:18.850
Wait.
Where is he anyway?

15:18.951 --> 15:20.441
Oh, dude.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.247
Scooby got out!

15:25.724 --> 15:27.692
Here we are.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.293
I had a really great time tonight.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.796
Yeah, me too.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.763
Do you wanna come upstairs?

15:43.042 --> 15:44.942
I'd love to.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.908
There's just one little thing,
and it probably doesn't matter, but...

15:51.784 --> 15:53.342
I don't want to get married.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.615
I've been saying that all night
just to get in your pants.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.153
Can you belie...

16:07.866 --> 16:10.858
Oh, my God!
I found Scooby's wallet!

16:10.970 --> 16:14.701
Oh, no! That means the poor guy's
out there with no identification.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.298
Robin! Hey, hey,
um, remember Scooby?

16:17.409 --> 16:19.969
- Uh, well, he got out.
- "Got out"? What do you mean?

16:20.079 --> 16:22.604
He just walked out of the apartment.
Someone must've left the door open.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.376
- It wasn't me.
- Me neither.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.146
He must've figured out
how to open it himself.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.347
He's so smart. We should get him
on <i>Letterman</i> doing tricks.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.449
I know Paul Shaffer's sandwich guy.
This could happen.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.586
Guys! Get yourselves together
and start looking for Scooby.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.290
- I'm on my way home.
- Wait, wait! Robin!

16:40.399 --> 16:42.924
Can you pick up
some calzones?

16:43.936 --> 16:46.131
Nora, wait, wait.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.229
I'm sorry I mislead you.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.969
Mislead? You lied to me!
You had your friends lie to me!

16:52.077 --> 16:54.307
I was on the spot.
This is your fault.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.382
- My fault?
- Yeah, with the whole
"I want to get married" thing.

16:57.483 --> 17:01.579
You just can't tell someone exactly
what you want out of a relationship.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.915
This...

17:03.022 --> 17:05.080
isn't England.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.715
Good-bye, Barney.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.361
- Scooby!
- Scoob!

17:13.464 --> 17:16.627
- Hey, great idea.
- Uh, no. <i>Great</i> idea!

17:16.734 --> 17:19.863
Okay, if you were new in town and had
just ingested an eighth of sandwich...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.872
where would you go?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.464
Of course.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.406
Back to the pizza place!

17:25.511 --> 17:28.377
- Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.
- Who's Scooby?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.880
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, have you seen Scooby?

17:30.983 --> 17:33.543
Uh, yeah. Isn't that him
taking a leak on that fire hydrant?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.048
Scooby!

17:38.123 --> 17:39.852
Oh, hey! It's my friends!

17:39.958 --> 17:42.188
No!

17:42.294 --> 17:42.394
And that explains
12:51 a.m.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.591
And that explains
12:51 a.m.

17:45.697 --> 17:49.394
Okay, none of this suggests
a systemic issue. Your heart's fine.

17:49.501 --> 17:54.029
With a healthy diet you can live a long
and happy life, if nobody stabs you.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.697
Day's not over.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.672
Okay, Lily...

17:58.777 --> 18:01.803
I'm sorry that I lied about
wanting to settle down.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.882
No, that wasn't the lie.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.712
The lie was when you told Nora
you were lying.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.218
Because you weren't.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.618
You want that stuff, Barney.
I know you do.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.425
Okay, maybe eventually
I could settle down...

18:17.396 --> 18:18.863
50 years from now...

18:18.964 --> 18:21.728
if I have, like, a Hefner thing goin' on
with some really hot twins.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.324
But those twins...

18:23.435 --> 18:26.598
won't even be born
for another...

18:26.705 --> 18:28.172
32 years.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.442
I mean, Nora's great.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.408
She's wonderful, but...

18:33.512 --> 18:35.070
What time was
your dinner reservation?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.909
Last night?
8:30.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.176
What did his heart
do at 8:30?

18:50.295 --> 18:53.423
It literally skipped a beat.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.961
Your heart's talkin' to you, Barney.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.970
Do you have the guts to listen to it?

19:04.343 --> 19:07.835
<i># Stones that I #</i>

19:07.946 --> 19:10.380
<i># Carry #</i>

19:11.583 --> 19:13.278
<i># Around #</i>

19:19.691 --> 19:21.784
- I lied.
- Barney.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.455
- When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.
- I'm confused.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.293
So am I.

19:27.399 --> 19:31.859
This. All of this. This is totally new to me.
But I know it's what I want.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.235
I want to be confused with you.

19:36.808 --> 19:41.370
<i># I have to search #</i>

19:41.480 --> 19:45.177
Mom, Dad,
this is Barney.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.481
Hi. I'm Barney.
Great to meet you.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.488
Hey, you wanna see a magic trick?
