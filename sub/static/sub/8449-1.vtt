01:02.271 --> 01:05.479
[ Male voice narrating I ah, look at that.
San Francisco in the summertime.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.598
Wow. Beautiful, isn't it?

01:07.693 --> 01:10.025
Blue skies, sunshine.

01:10.112 --> 01:14.697
Perfect day to cruise around the city with
your head hanging out of the car window.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.321
Perfect day to chase
that annoying postman.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.371
A perfect day to Mark
that special fire hydrant.

01:22.457 --> 01:26.325
Perfect, that is, for everyone that's
not about to lose their best friend.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.331
Hey, boy.

01:28.422 --> 01:33.257
See, today is the day Maya dolittle starts
getting ready to go off to college.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.085
It's a dog's worst nightmare.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.592
But this dog is not just gonna
roll over and take it lying down.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.969
Oh, no.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.103
J»

01:46.189 --> 01:48.350
Mmm.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.150
Oh, here we go.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.335
Mm-hmm. Jo

02:27.397 --> 02:31.140
Hmm. It's just so weird.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.192
I keep trying to pack, but I don't
seem to be getting anywhere.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.361
Ah, yeah. Weird!

02:36.448 --> 02:39.110
Can you believe it, lucky?

02:39.201 --> 02:42.944
Just two more weeks, and I will
officially be a student at vet school!

02:43.038 --> 02:46.201
Oh! I just can't wait to start working
with animals. It's so exciting!

02:46.291 --> 02:51.035
Yeah. Exciting. - Luck, I'm sorry.
Dogs aren't allowed in the dorms.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.212
You see, that's what makes no sense.
It's vet school.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.458
You know, you'd think they'd want
animals there, right? I know.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.808
- What is he saying?
- Oh, we're just talking about college.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.010
Oh. Well, I just
came in to tell you...

03:08.105 --> 03:12.565
Your orientation DVD from San Francisco
university has just arrived.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.775
It did? Uh-huh.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.103
Let's go watch it! Come on!

03:18.198 --> 03:22.191
In tonight's Hollywood dish, L.A.
party girl Tiffany Monaco...

03:22.285 --> 03:25.994
Has found herself in the middle
of yet another celebrity feud,

03:26.081 --> 03:29.665
this time with former friend
dasha pringle-

03:29.751 --> 03:33.369
huh? Excusez-moi?
Monkey was watching that!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.419
Mm-hmm.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.499
Hmph! People! No respect
for their ancestors.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.336
- Ooh! Are you ready?
- Yeah.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.594
Jj

03:45.684 --> 03:50.553
Congratulations on your admittance
to San Francisco university's...

03:50.647 --> 03:52.888
Pre-veterinary medicine program.

03:52.983 --> 03:57.226
I would like to take this opportunity
to give you a quick overview.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.072
Years one and two comprise
your foundational studies,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.867
what you would call
your sciences, your maths.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.865
Years one and two?

04:07.956 --> 04:10.996
I have to go through two whole years
before I can start working with animals?

04:11.042 --> 04:13.020
That's ridiculous. I guess that's
just their program, honey.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.751
Year three is your first
formal year of veterinary study.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.625
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

04:18.716 --> 04:22.050
San Francisco university has state-of-the-art
software detailing the anatomy...

04:22.137 --> 04:24.549
Of over 2,000 species.

04:24.639 --> 04:28.632
Wait. Software? We've gotta be getting
to the real animals soon, right?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.760
I don't know. During year four,

04:30.854 --> 04:33.721
you'll be working
with anatomical models.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.103
Models? This has to be a joke.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.185
Oh, you mean,
like, you going away.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.737
Years five and six will send you back
to the books. - Back to the books?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.691
And then you're ready
to enter the real world...

04:45.786 --> 04:48.118
With a 10-month
residency program.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.366
What? Ten more months?

04:50.457 --> 04:55.076
But once you've successfully
completed that, congratulations!

04:55.170 --> 04:58.082
You'll finally be
a licensed veterinarian.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.917
See you in the fall. No!

05:03.011 --> 05:06.549
I can't believe this. That's, like,
almost seven years from now.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.347
In seven years, I'll be... 25!

05:09.434 --> 05:13.768
Yeah, and I'll be, uh-
I can't even woof that high.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.062
Man, dog years are depressing.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.232
Twenty-five years old? My life
will basically be over by then.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.311
I just wanna help animals.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.862
Do I really have to wait
seven years to do it?

05:24.950 --> 05:28.283
Maya, caring for animals is a big
responsibility. There is so much to learn.

05:28.370 --> 05:32.488
- It's gonna take some time.
- But, mom, I can talk to animals.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.618
I don't need to learn
all that stuff.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.121
They can just tell me what's
wrong, and I can help them.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.373
- Monkey.
- Huh?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.830
Is there anything wrong that
you'd like me to help you with?

05:41.925 --> 05:45.167
Well, I am slightly bothered
by the term “monkey.”

05:45.262 --> 05:50.882
From now on, I would prefer to be
referred to as a primate-American.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.013
Okay. Bad example, but-

05:54.104 --> 05:58.063
Maya, there is a lot more to helping animals
than just being able to talk to them.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.858
If you really want to help, becoming a
veterinarian is the best way to do it.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.482
But, mom, it's just
a long time to wait.

06:04.573 --> 06:09.033
Et voila! My latest masterpiece.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.519
Actually, there is a way that
you can help animals right now.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.664
How? You can help by taking
your dog for a walk.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.581
Now, I'll bark to that!

06:17.586 --> 06:17.950
Now, I'll bark to that!

06:18.044 --> 06:20.285
It's just ridiculous, lucky.
I mean, I'm different.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.334
I shouldn't have to do what
everybody else does. I agree.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.633
You should just skip school
altogether and stay here with me.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.429
I'm sure there are plenty of animals you
could help right here on this very street.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.972
Whoo, talk about a coincidence.
What? Come on.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.141
Hang on.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.435
Hey, little guy.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.562
How are you, huh?

06:45.155 --> 06:48.443
- I think it's been up there a while.
- Come on now. Come here.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.492
Ah, cat stuck in a tree.
Defect of the species, really.

06:52.621 --> 06:56.034
Ma'am, is that your cat up there?
Oh, yes!

06:56.124 --> 06:58.581
Mr. sillywillykins
just won't come down.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.829
“Mr. sillywillykins”?

07:00.921 --> 07:04.288
Man, being stuck in a tree is the
least of that dude's problems.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.045
Oh, I just hope that fireman
is able to bring him down.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.964
Come on. Come on, boy.
[ Howling, hissing I

07:10.096 --> 07:12.178
come on now. Come here.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.507
Uh-oh.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.311
That's not a cat.
That's a mountain lion!

07:23.401 --> 07:27.189
I knew it! Mr. sillywillykins
is too much for them.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.113
He has the reflexes
of a cat, you know.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.818
Mckible here. Yeah, we're
gonna need some help.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.890
It's a real claw job, I'm telling you.
Okay, ma'am.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.114
Just don't worry about your kitty.
He will be just fine.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.895
- I'm gonna go see if I can do anything.
- Okay, right away.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.411
Okay. All right. Thanks. Uh,
excuse me, sir. Can I help at all?

07:44.506 --> 07:47.248
- You can help by keeping back.
- You get assistance?

07:47.342 --> 07:50.175
Nah, just some girl who thinks
she can help or something.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.637
Hey there, little guy.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.894
Um, why won't you come down?
What's going on?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.067
Huh? What?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.940
It's okay. I can understand you.
I'm a dolittle.

08:10.031 --> 08:14.365
A dolittle? All right! I heard
about your family! Good people!

08:14.452 --> 08:17.034
Oh, thanks. So what's going on?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.706
I refuse to live with that woman
for one more second!

08:20.792 --> 08:23.329
Why not? What's wrong with her?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.287
Come over tomorrow night around bath
time, and you can see for yourself.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.714
Wait. But you're a cat. You're
not supposed to bathe a cat.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.462
Exactly! We self-groom!

08:32.554 --> 08:36.638
I mean, hasn't she ever wondered what
we're doing when we do this? Mmm, mmm.

08:36.725 --> 08:40.308
If she wants to bathe anyone, she
should start by bathing herself

08:40.395 --> 08:42.977
talk about old-lady smell!

08:43.063 --> 08:45.897
Ugh! Gag me with a fur ball!

08:46.985 --> 08:49.522
Excuse me. What's going on here?

08:49.612 --> 08:53.196
Oh, that nice young lady is helping
my kitty down from that tree.

08:53.283 --> 08:57.993
What? Hey!
She can't be up there!

08:58.079 --> 09:00.320
You can't be up there!
Come down now.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.452
Look at that. It's almost like
they're having a conversation.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.454
Thanks.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.831
Come on. Come on. Come on.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.504
Okay. Well, if she agrees
to never bathe you again-

09:10.592 --> 09:12.423
and start bathing herself.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.843
And to start bathing herself,
will you come down?

09:15.972 --> 09:19.180
It's okay. Just hang on.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.969
Here you go. Thank you so much.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.932
You silly old thing.
Oh, I missed you so much.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.439
This little kitty's nine lives
are still intact...

09:31.529 --> 09:34.191
Thanks to 17-year-old
Maya dolittle,

09:34.282 --> 09:39.026
daughter of world-renowned animal
communicator, Dr. John dolittle.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.361
Like her father,
the younger dolittle...

09:41.456 --> 09:44.698
Actually talked the cat
down from the tree.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.205
I guess you could say
the cat didn't get her tongue.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.832
I can't believe I made the news!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.879
It is very exciting.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.628
My MySpace page is going crazy!

09:54.719 --> 09:57.927
You see? This is what
I want to do with my life.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.053
I didn't have to go through years of school
just to help that cat down from the tree.

10:02.185 --> 10:06.770
Yeah, I'm with you. There's gotta be some
way I can start helping animals now.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.186
Who could that be?

10:11.945 --> 10:16.279
Okay, so get this-it's a reality
show about me doing a reality show.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.073
So it's going to be,
like, twice as real!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.151
I can't wait to read the script.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.453
Uh, excuse me. Can I help you?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.077
But what I'm really excited
about is my new perfume.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.929
Um, excuse me. I couldn't
believe it either.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.919
It was so hard figuring out
what I wanted it to smell like.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.901
Did you know that there are, like,
dozens of different smells in the world?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.916
Oh, my gosh! I couldn't
believe it either.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.968
That's Tiffany Monaco! Lucky,
do you know who that is?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.764
- That is the heiress-heiress.
- Heiress-heiress? What's she an heiress of?

10:42.851 --> 10:46.435
Of being an heiress! Her mom was
an heiress who married an heir

10:46.521 --> 10:49.012
she's, like, one of the hottest
celebrities out there!

10:49.107 --> 10:51.519
I read her exclusive interview.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.316
Her favorite color is pink.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.109
You're Maya, right? Right.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.324
What am I talking about?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.997
You are coming to L.A. with me.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.915
Los Angeles? Why?

11:10.003 --> 11:13.245
Because I saw you on TV!

11:13.381 --> 11:16.873
You are the girl who can talk
to animals, right? Uh-huh.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.175
So you've gotta come with me
and talk to Princess.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.967
Who's Princess? Princess, you know?
My little dog.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.259
She has been totally
depressed lately.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.641
She wouldn't even come with me to San
Fran for our spring shopping trip.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.815
There's this awesome little boutique
here that sells high heels for dogs.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.858
It's called best in shoe.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.357
So obviously she's
totally messed, right?

11:38.489 --> 11:40.650
And I need you to talk to her.
So, wait.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.905
You're saying your pet needs help,
and you think I can help her?

11:43.995 --> 11:45.701
Yeah.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.155
Can you stay right here
for one minute for me, please?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.582
Where? Absolutely not.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.081
Come on, mom. Please!
I really want to do this.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.505
Maya, we are leaving in two
weeks to take you to college.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.174
We have way too much
to do before then.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.698
And with your father in China working
with the pandas for a month,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.713
it is all up to you and me.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.299
- Mom, we'll get it done. Don't worry.
- Maya.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.350
Mom, come on. You've seen
the orientation video.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.929
I won't be able to help another
animal for seven years.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.436
Please, just let me
help this one now.

12:15.526 --> 12:19.018
Maya, try the puppy dog eyes.
She's a sucker for those.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.355
Come on, with me. In
three, two, one, and-

12:22.450 --> 12:24.361
please.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.795
Now, call me as soon as you arrive and then
call me again an hour after that, okay?

12:37.924 --> 12:41.087
As a matter of fact, just call
me every hour. Okay, mom!

12:41.177 --> 12:44.089
You will have her back tomorrow
morning, right? I have my own jet!

12:44.180 --> 12:48.799
Mom, don't worry! Everything
will be fine, I promise.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.392
Okay. All right!
More time with Maya!

12:51.479 --> 12:53.435
I get the window seat.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.515
Finally, the break
I've been waiting for!

12:56.609 --> 12:59.942
Hollywood, here I come! Ha-ha!

13:00.029 --> 13:02.987
Maya, remember, I'll be
waiting for your call, honey.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.281
I won't forget.
I'll call you when I land.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.575
I sure hope Maya
packed some snacks in here.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.653

25:19.393 --> 25:21.930
It's just too bad you're going
to San Francisco so soon.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.927
Yeah. Hmm.

25:24.064 --> 25:27.056
There he is!

25:27.192 --> 25:29.103
Okay. Spot check. What?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.897
Hmm. Oh.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.941
Smudge? Okay! We're good.
Good luck.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.243
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.789
All this fuss for some lousy actor?
Come on, Maya.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.583
I know these kind of guys.
They're all dogs.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.661
Lucky, just be nice, okay?

25:48.756 --> 25:50.712
Okay, but if this guy
gets fresh with you,

25:50.799 --> 25:53.131
I'm gonna take a big bite
out of his-

25:53.218 --> 25:56.051
hot dog!

25:56.138 --> 25:59.346
Ahh! Hey, Maya.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.345
I hope you don't mind,
but I brought my dog.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.552
Maya, this is Emmy.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.183
- Oh, hey, girl. How you doin'?
- Hello.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.061
Hi. I'm, uh-I'm lucky.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.393
No. I think I'm the one
that's lucky.

26:12.488 --> 26:17.073
Bowwow! I think I just met my dream dog.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.487
Hope you like to play!
What, are you kidding?

26:19.620 --> 26:21.906
I'm the one that put the “lic”
in “frolic”

26:22.039 --> 26:25.873
well, looks like they've hit it off.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.917
So you want to go for a walk?

26:29.004 --> 26:31.711
Okay.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.007
Don't worry, Rick.
We are totally on schedule.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.053
So how do you like
Hollywood so far?

26:40.140 --> 26:43.382
Oh, it's amazing.
I mean, look at this place!

26:43.477 --> 26:45.388
Everything is so different
and exciting.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.515
I'll bet you love living here.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.473
Love living here? Yeah, I
don't know about that.

26:50.567 --> 26:54.059
I mean, I love acting,
but Hollywood?

26:54.154 --> 26:57.772
To tell you the truth, sometimes I
think about going back to school...

26:57.866 --> 27:00.573
And learning to do something
completely different.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.243
Really? Like what?

27:03.330 --> 27:07.790
I don't know. There's just so much
out there to learn, you know?

27:07.876 --> 27:10.913
If you started tomorrow, you'd
probably finish before I did.

27:11.046 --> 27:15.130
Oh! Well, when do you go to college?
I start next week.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.170
Really? Yeah.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.343
Wait. So what are you
doing here?

27:19.429 --> 27:21.511
To tell you the truth,

27:21.598 --> 27:23.680
I don't really even know myself.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.102
So, what was that thing
at the party?

27:28.188 --> 27:31.100
That little trick you pulled
with the day-glo dog?

27:31.191 --> 27:33.648
Oh, no. That wasn't a trick.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.727
I can talk to animals,
and they can talk to me.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.658
That was a good one.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.077
You really had me going
there for a second.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.874
Oh, so you really don't
believe me, huh? Okay.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.368
Emmy! Emmy, come here, girl!

27:52.462 --> 27:54.498
Come here.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.127
Come here.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.960
Look, I need you to tell me something
about Brandon that only you would know.

28:01.054 --> 28:05.138
Oh, really?

28:07.769 --> 28:09.680
Ooh. That's interesting.

28:09.771 --> 28:13.104
It's a bit sad, actually.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.652
Mm-hmm.

28:19.781 --> 28:24.241
Okay, okay. What did she “say”?
Oh, nothing really.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.239
Just that you TiVo dr: Ph/I..

28:26.330 --> 28:29.117
And still sleep with star
wars sheets on your bed.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.868
Oh, my god.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.213
You can talk to animals.
I told you so.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.336
It runs in my family.

28:40.427 --> 28:44.670
My father is this really amazing man
who helps animals all over the world.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.177
Dolittle is kind of
a big name to live up to,

28:47.267 --> 28:50.054
so that's why I just want
to get started, you know?

28:50.145 --> 28:53.103
I feel like every day I'm not
using my gift, I'm wasting it.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.023
Yeah! It really is
an amazing gift.

28:56.109 --> 28:59.226
And to think, today you used it
to find out I'm a total dork.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.025
Shall we?

29:02.115 --> 29:04.026
Sure.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.028
So, what's your favorite movie?

29:06.161 --> 29:09.779
Oh, that's easy. Lady and the tramp.
Really? Mine too!

29:09.873 --> 29:12.535
Wow! It's uncanny, isn't it?

29:12.626 --> 29:15.208
Yeah. It's like we came
from the same pet store.

29:15.295 --> 29:18.287
I know. It's so romantic!

29:21.468 --> 29:24.210
It's too bad we didn't get a chance
to spend more time together.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.673
A little more time with Emmy, and who knows
what I would have found out about you.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.135
Well, uh,

29:33.230 --> 29:35.437
it was nice meeting you,
Maya dolittle.

29:35.524 --> 29:39.733
Oh, it was nice meeting you too, Mr.
Brandon booker.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.438
So, if you guys ever make it out to
the bay area, sniff me out, huh?

29:43.532 --> 29:46.194
And you can always send me
a “flea mail.” get it?

29:47.995 --> 29:50.111
Get it? Flea mail'

29:50.205 --> 29:53.447
uh, hello?
Plane to catch, remember?

29:55.335 --> 29:58.498
Well, have a good trip, huh?
You too.

29:58.588 --> 30:02.922
Not that you're going anywhere,
because you live here.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.966
Um, "m gonna get in the car now.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.840
Yeah. I'll see you, Tiffany.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.561
Thank you.

30:24.114 --> 30:27.026
Hey, it's okay.
Maybe you'll see him again.

30:27.117 --> 30:30.826
I don't know how. I'm gonna be in college
in San Francisco, and he'll be here.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.903
Well, you never know.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.831
Sometimes life takes, like,
totally unexpected turns, right?

30:55.645 --> 30:58.808
I just, um, need to pick up
something from my agent's office.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.805
It'll only take a sec. Okay.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.853
You come too. Okay.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.935
Okay. Hey, what about me?

31:05.030 --> 31:08.193
Thank you.
What am I, chopped liver?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.367
Star map? Huh!

31:13.455 --> 31:16.492
What kind of a star map
doesn't feature king Kong?

31:16.583 --> 31:19.120
What a rip-off!

31:19.211 --> 31:22.203
Come on. His office
is right down here.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.169
Yeah. It's chase.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.593
Listen, I met someone at a party
I think could be huge!

31:30.680 --> 31:34.548
Yeah. And get this-
he's a monkey.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.476
No, no, a-monkey.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
He's gonna be huge, man.

31:40.190 --> 31:43.557
I love the new decor here.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.323
Jj

31:55.080 --> 31:57.867
Uh, Tiffany, what's going on?

31:57.999 --> 32:00.957
Is that-that's right.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.878
It's you, Maya dolittle,
on television!

32:04.965 --> 32:07.297
Better get used to it, girl.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.966
Better get used to it? Tiffany,
what is he talking about?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.294
Just listen to what
he has to say, 'Kay?

32:12.389 --> 32:14.880
Ladies, please have
a seat on that couch.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.341
Come on in.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.769
Hi, Maya.
My name is Rick Beverly.

32:20.856 --> 32:24.394
And I like to consider
myself a dream maker.

32:24.484 --> 32:28.693
I spend my life
making people's dreams...

32:28.780 --> 32:30.987
Come true.

32:31.074 --> 32:35.192
I did it for Tiffany,
and I can do it for you too.

32:35.287 --> 32:40.623
Now, I know all about
your amazing talents.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.872
And I bet I know
what your dream is-

32:46.047 --> 32:48.709
to spend your life
helping the animals, right?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.667
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.969
That's beautiful.
Just like your daddy.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.047
You got me right
in my heart part.

32:57.142 --> 33:01.476
Well, what better way
to help those poor animals...

33:01.563 --> 33:04.430
Than with your very own TV show?

33:04.524 --> 33:06.515
Atv show?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.858
Maya, the world-

33:11.948 --> 33:14.234
no, the animals-

33:14.326 --> 33:17.033
they need someone who cares,

33:17.120 --> 33:20.988
someone who can
give them a voice.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.539
And who better
to give them that voice...

33:23.627 --> 33:26.790
Than someone who can
actually talk to them?

33:26.880 --> 33:31.624
Who better
than you, Maya dolittle?

33:31.718 --> 33:34.755
Uh-so, wait.

33:34.846 --> 33:39.636
What you're trying to say is
you want to put me onatv show?

33:39.726 --> 33:43.184
No. He's saying he wants
to put us on TV!

33:43.271 --> 33:47.139
Exactly! Tiffany and Maya!

33:47.275 --> 33:50.642
Jo the animal talkers!

33:50.737 --> 33:52.978
It will be so hot!

33:53.073 --> 33:55.593
We'll wear, like, really amazing
outfits and have on really cool pets.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.279
Cool! Maybe you can even teach
me how to talk to animals too!

33:58.370 --> 34:01.737
Wait, wait! Wait, you guys.
Hold on.

34:01.831 --> 34:05.665
This is all really exciting,
but I can't do a TV show.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.243
I'm about to start studying
to become a veterinarian.

34:08.338 --> 34:12.172
Wow! A veterinarian.
Good for you.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.295
I bet that takes
a long time though, huh?

34:15.387 --> 34:18.379
Yeah, it actually does.
Like seven years.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.509
Oh! Seven years?

34:20.600 --> 34:23.056
What a long time to waste-
I mean, wait.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.514
Or...

34:26.606 --> 34:29.188
You could do this TV show...

34:29.275 --> 34:32.484
And start helping
those poor little animals...

34:32.571 --> 34:34.482
Right now.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.828
Yes, lucky, this is the answer
[Ve been looking for.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.121
The answer? Wait a minute.

34:46.208 --> 34:49.621
So if you did this TV show, then
you wouldn't go away to college?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.623
Nope! Wouldn't have to.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.502
I love it! The animal
talkers, it's brilliant!

34:54.592 --> 34:56.754
Oh, thank you, lucky.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.382
Thank you for always looking
out for what's best for me.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.929
What's best for you?
Oh, yes, exactly.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.303
I mean, who else
would I be thinking of?

35:06.730 --> 35:08.391
Oh, no. It's mom.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.143
I don't know if she'll be as supportive.
What should I do?

35:11.234 --> 35:13.441
Tell her. Might as well
get it over with, right?

35:13.528 --> 35:15.393
I'll just try
to buy us some time.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.444
Hello?

35:17.532 --> 35:20.649
Hey, mom!
Uh, no, we haven't left yet.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.735
But, um, I was thinking,

35:22.829 --> 35:26.037
would it be okay if I stayed
another couple days or so?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.581
Another couple days? Maya, no.
You have to get back.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.659
This was supposed to be
an overnight thing.

35:30.754 --> 35:33.917
Mom, mom, come on. Just
listen to me for a second.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.965
I may have an opportunity to help
a lot more animals out here...

35:37.052 --> 35:39.008
If I just stay a little longer.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.004
Longer? How much longer?
Well, I don't know yet.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.555
Okay.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.353
Stay a few more days.
Help some more animals.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.806
I guess I can finish up
this packing myself,

35:52.901 --> 35:56.610
and as long as you're back by
Saturday, we should be in good shape.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.529
Okay. All right. Thank you, mommy.
Have fun.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.527
Love you. Bye.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.825
Yes!

36:05.789 --> 36:09.623
I had my chef prepare a special breakfast to
celebrate the first day of your new life!

36:09.709 --> 36:12.746
Wow. Have I died and gone
to doggie heaven or what?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.294
So, eat up and enjoy,
and then we've got to motor.

36:15.382 --> 36:19.142
Rick wants to pitch our show to the networks,
like, yesterday, so we're already totally behind.

36:19.219 --> 36:22.198
Oh, don't worry. I already started thinking
about what the show should be like.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.055
I think I want it to be,
like, educational, you know?

36:25.141 --> 36:28.133
We can answer viewers' questions, and
we can go into the audience and-

36:28.228 --> 36:32.141
that reminds me! We need guests, so I figured
we could go on the Internet and, like-

36:32.232 --> 36:34.848
okay, like, press pause.
We are way ahead of you on that.

36:34.943 --> 36:38.151
Rick's already set up a bunch of
appointments with possible celebrity guests.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.190
Wait. Celebrity guests? Totally!

36:40.281 --> 36:44.024
You think anyone's gonna watch the show if
we just interview regular people's animals?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.071
I don't think so! Really?

36:46.162 --> 36:48.073
Ugh. Smells like fish eggs.
Oh, well.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.435
Celebrity guests, they're okay, too,
but I don't want it to all be about that.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.370
Right, right.
Of course, of course.

36:53.461 --> 36:58.046
But, Maya, trust me, if we want the show to
take off, we've got to shoot for the stars.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.381
Okay. Whatever you say.
All right

37:00.468 --> 37:04.586
- come on!
- Mmm. Mmm-mmm!

37:04.723 --> 37:06.588
Here we are. Where are we?

37:06.725 --> 37:09.307
Do you like Chad Cassidy movies?
Of course.

37:09.436 --> 37:12.143
Well, that's whose house this is.
No way!

37:12.272 --> 37:14.888
I like to call him Chad hunkly.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.690
Hi, Chad!

37:21.781 --> 37:25.569
Miss Monaco! Come on down.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.493
Hey, love you, babe.

37:36.171 --> 37:40.665
Sorry about having to meet out here,
but I'm training for my next role.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.084
I'm doing the Abe Lincoln story.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.261
We spiced it up a little bit.

37:46.347 --> 37:51.057
Chad, we're doing this show, and we would
love you and chubster to be on it.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.100
Right, Maya?

37:54.397 --> 37:57.480
Maya? Oh, oh! Um, yeah.

37:57.567 --> 38:01.059
I'm sorry. I've just seen all your movies.
I'm a really big fan of yours.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.486
Yeah, me too.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.780
But, um, Tiffany's right. We would
love for you to be on our show.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.408
It's gonna be all about
celebrities and their pets.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.911
Well, that's not
what it's all about.

38:15.001 --> 38:18.994
That's part of it, but it's mostly
about helping all kinds of animals.

38:19.088 --> 38:22.251
Oh, yeah? Well, funny
you came by today...

38:22.342 --> 38:25.505
Because I could really use some
help with my pig, chubster.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.673
Really? Yeah.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.096
She's been giving me
problems lately.

38:30.183 --> 38:33.141
She's lost her appetite or something.
She just won't eat.

38:33.228 --> 38:36.436
No matter what I try to give her,
she just turns her nose up at it.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.725
Really? Yeah.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.935
Hmm. I'll tell you what.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.942
If you can figure out what's wrong
with her, I'll do your show.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.649
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

38:49.786 --> 38:51.742
Okay, Maya. Do your stuff. Okay.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.741
This way.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.707
There she is right there.
Hey, chub.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.077
Chubster

39:00.171 --> 39:03.038
I just don't know
what's wrong with her.

39:03.132 --> 39:07.091
Chubster? Hi! I'm Maya.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.715
So I hear you're not too
interested in food lately.

39:09.848 --> 39:14.182
What's going on? What's the matter?
Look at me! I'm obese!

39:14.269 --> 39:17.978
Okay. But you're a pig.
Aren't you supposed to be fat?

39:18.064 --> 39:23.184
Says who? Why does the word “pig” always
have to be associated with being fat?

39:23.278 --> 39:26.611
Well, I ain't gonna be part
of the problem no more!

39:26.698 --> 39:30.987
Well, look, I applaud you for what you're
trying to do, but you can't just not eat.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.031
It's not healthy.
What else can I do?

39:34.122 --> 39:36.113
I have a slow metabolism!

39:36.207 --> 39:38.949
Well, I really don't know
what to tell you.

39:41.254 --> 39:45.293
You know what?
I think I have an idea.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.084
J let yourselfgo

39:50.179 --> 39:52.386
oh, thank you, Maya!

39:52.473 --> 39:55.180
I can feel the pounds
just dropping off already.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.680
Bikini season, here I come!

39:57.770 --> 40:01.103
You shouldn't have any trouble
with getting her to eat now.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.182
But you should also consider
a low-calorie diet.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.859
Wow. I don't know
what to say, but...

40:06.946 --> 40:09.483
I'll see you at the
taping of your new show.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.442
- Right, chubster?
- You got it, Chad baby!

40:13.536 --> 40:16.869
Oh, you nailed it!
You really nailed it.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.159
I did? Totally! You know what?

40:19.292 --> 40:23.160
I think you and I make a really great team.
I think we do.

40:23.254 --> 40:27.793
Now, you get these next few celebs
to commit, and we are golden.

40:29.886 --> 40:33.003
You are gonna love this band.

doctor he said I'm sick

you on the set of your new film.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.483
So how can we help you
with your pony?

41:29.570 --> 41:33.483
Buttercup is a total
nightmare to work with.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.656
I should have listened
to my manager.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.860
He said never to work
with animals or children.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.946
Tell me about it.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.161
This is it. Just one left.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.959
You help this animal, and no
network in town will turn us down.

41:47.046 --> 41:50.880
Oh, great! So whose place is this,
and what kind of pet do they have?

41:50.967 --> 41:54.425
Mmm. You better
just see for yourself.

Ladies, this is serious. I mean,
I don't even know what to do.

42:50.359 --> 42:54.147
This is Mr. fluffernufferman.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.025
He, like, my best friend
in the whole world.

42:57.116 --> 43:00.825
He, like-he, like, the only
“g” I can really trust.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.244
You feel me?

43:03.331 --> 43:07.040
Thing is, he ain't really
been acting hisself lately.

43:07.126 --> 43:10.789
It's like he don't hang with
me and the homeys no more.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.872
He be all sulkin'
in the corners.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.378
Sometimes he be hiding
underneath the furniture, man.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.710
Don't worry.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.217
Maya will find out
what's bothering him.

43:21.307 --> 43:24.344
Ms. dolittle, you just

43:25.895 --> 43:30.434

43:30.525 --> 43:32.766
Okay.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.647
Hi, Mr. fluffernufferman.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.980
Um, I'm Maya. So you want
to tell me what's goin' on?

43:39.075 --> 43:43.535
I'll tell you what's going on.
I hate rap music!

43:43.621 --> 43:45.577
You do? Yeah!

43:45.665 --> 43:49.123
Look at these ears! They're
finely tuned instruments!

43:49.210 --> 43:52.668
They require something
more delicate, you know?

43:52.755 --> 43:55.622
Well, what did you have in mind?

43:55.716 --> 43:59.584
Jj [ Orchestra: Classical I

43:59.679 --> 44:01.761
yeah! Yeah, yeah!

44:01.889 --> 44:06.508
I could get down with this.
Yeah! Old school!

44:06.602 --> 44:09.844
So, uh, ladies, when's
this show of yours taping?

44:14.944 --> 44:17.936
Yes, he has a little
bunny rabbit. Can you believe it?

44:20.032 --> 44:23.365
Two days ago, I was sitting in my
bedroom packing to go to college,

44:23.452 --> 44:26.944
and now I'm in Los Angeles,
hanging out with celebrities...

44:27.081 --> 44:30.699
And putting together my own TV show.

44:30.793 --> 44:33.830
Oh, and not to mention going to
dinner with Brandon booker himself.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.288
That's right. That's right. - And you
won't even tell me where we're going.

44:37.383 --> 44:42.844
Will you trust me? You're gonna love
this place where I got... reservations.

44:42.930 --> 44:46.263
Best view in town.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.137
I think they used to shoot
episodes of Lassie up here.

44:49.228 --> 44:52.140
Lassie. Now, there was
a beautiful animal.

44:52.273 --> 44:54.480
Think she ever had any work done?
I don't know.

44:54.609 --> 44:58.272
Maybe a little collie-gen.
Good one!

45:00.198 --> 45:03.565
So, what about school? What
did you tell your parents?

45:03.659 --> 45:05.695
Well, I haven't
exactly told them yet.

45:05.828 --> 45:08.194
You haven't told them? No.

45:08.289 --> 45:12.453
I'll just wait to tell her
until things are final.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.831
Oh, and we go see the TV network tomorrow
to see if they want to put the show on.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.624
Really? Mm-bmm.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.330
Good luck! Oh, oh, oh.

45:19.425 --> 45:22.383
Okay. We're almost there.
It's just up ahead.

45:22.470 --> 45:25.883
I just don't understand where in the world
you would have reservations up here.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.680
Trust me. It is-

45:28.768 --> 45:30.804
amazing!

45:32.021 --> 45:34.478
Brandon, this is
absolutely amazing!

45:34.565 --> 45:36.601
I told you it was
the best view in town.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.354
You can see everything
from here.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.401
You really can.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.105
Look, that's the big
record building over there.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.111
Wow. This is really
something else.

45:46.202 --> 45:48.193
Remember that
cool theater we drove by?

45:48.287 --> 45:50.152
You see it right there?
You see it?

45:50.289 --> 45:53.122
Hollywood walk of fame! Yeah, yeah.
That's the bowling alley.

45:53.209 --> 45:55.370
You can see the ocean.
Oh, my god.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.703
Wow! Your owner
is a real class act.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.955
He's starting to smell better
and better to me. Mmm.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.631
So, hungry?

46:02.718 --> 46:06.677
Um, well, I haven't really had
much of an appetite recently.

46:06.806 --> 46:08.671
Oh. No? No.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.677
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

46:10.768 --> 46:14.101
I've just been feeling
a little off the past few days.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.395
- Really tired too.
- Huh?

46:16.482 --> 46:18.848
Oh, hey, hang on a second.
Uh, hey, Maya.

46:18.943 --> 46:22.902
Emmy said she's feeling a little strange-really
tired, doesn't want to eat and stuff

46:22.989 --> 46:24.854
any ideas?

46:24.991 --> 46:28.529
Is he talking to you right now?
Actually, he is.

46:28.661 --> 46:32.370
He said Emmy's feeling a little weird.
She is?

46:32.456 --> 46:35.573
Yeah, but don't worry.
I'm sure I can help her.

46:35.668 --> 46:39.536
So you're feeling a little tired
and you don't want to eat.

46:39.630 --> 46:44.044
Hmm. Well, maybe a change of
diet can have a positive effect.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.627
I met this pig today who has a big
problem with food.

46:47.722 --> 46:49.713
So what do you think, girl?

46:49.807 --> 46:51.889
Maybe a little variety
might help?

46:51.976 --> 46:54.433
Sure. Okay. I'm willing
to give it a try.

46:54.520 --> 46:58.058
Lucky, there are some extra dumplings
in the basket. Why don't you try those?

46:58.149 --> 47:01.232
Thanks, Maya. - Ah, you're
welcome, girl. And don't worry.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.685
Everything will be okay.

47:06.324 --> 47:09.782
What? Nothing.

47:09.869 --> 47:14.203
It's just that... the view's not the
only thing up here that's amazing.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.291
Here you go.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.414
Dig into these.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.871
You got some sauce on your nose.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.581
I did? Where?

47:25.676 --> 47:27.291
Here. I'll get it.

47:27.386 --> 47:32.301
Whoa. I-I knew being sloppy
would pay off someday, but-

47:32.391 --> 47:34.347
ahh!

47:58.876 --> 48:02.334
Add to that appearances
by one Chad Cassidy,

48:02.421 --> 48:06.710
not to mention hip-hop
superstar ridiculuz,

48:06.801 --> 48:10.385
on top of all the other celebrities
we have already discussed,

48:10.471 --> 48:12.678
and ladies and gentlemen,
I think-

48:12.765 --> 48:16.223
no, I know
that you have found...

48:16.310 --> 48:18.926
Your next big show.

48:19.939 --> 48:23.102
Hmm. Hmm.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.729
Hmm. Hmm.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.274
Hmm.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.776
I think.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.492
We love it.

48:39.625 --> 48:42.207
You do? More than love it

48:42.294 --> 48:44.330
love love it!

48:44.422 --> 48:47.459
That's a lot of love.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.461
We think this show can be big.

48:49.552 --> 48:53.170
- Hmm.
- No. Bigger than big.

48:53.264 --> 48:56.882
- Hmm.
- Huge!

48:56.976 --> 49:00.514
- Hugely big.
- Hmm.

49:01.897 --> 49:06.140
In fact, we have a hole
in our fall schedule...

49:06.235 --> 49:08.567
I think we could fill
with this show.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.986
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna be on TV!

49:11.073 --> 49:13.530
I can start helping animals
right now!

49:13.617 --> 49:18.407
Absolutely. There are, however, a few
small changes we'd like to discuss first

49:18.497 --> 49:20.237
small changes?

49:20.332 --> 49:23.244
Oh, smaller than small.
Itsy-bitsy.

49:23.335 --> 49:27.624
- Teeny-weeny.
- Okay. Like what?

49:27.715 --> 49:32.630
Well, for starters, we'd like to
tone down the whole “helping” thing.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.177
Tone down? But that's what
this show is all about.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.129
Oh, absolutely.

49:37.266 --> 49:41.179
We just think the show could be
more entertaining-mm-hmm.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.761
- While it's helping.
- Hmm.

49:43.856 --> 49:45.972
But it has to help.

49:46.066 --> 49:51.186
I swear, if this show doesn't help,
I don't know what we're doing here.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.692
Mm-mmm.

49:55.451 --> 49:59.160
- Any of us.
- Um-hmm.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.157
Oh! Okay.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.331
Well I can understand that
more entertaining.

50:04.418 --> 50:06.534
Uh, anything else?

50:06.629 --> 50:10.793
We can iron out
all the finer details later

50:10.883 --> 50:14.796
right now the big question is...

50:14.887 --> 50:16.878
Do we have a deal?

50:22.686 --> 50:24.677
Maya dolittle,

50:28.526 --> 50:31.268
welcome to network television.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.151
Oh!

50:36.242 --> 50:38.654
Yes!

50:38.744 --> 50:40.985
Congratulations, kiddo!
You did it!

50:41.080 --> 50:43.947
Oh, thanks, guys. But look,
I still have one concern.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.032
I know the show still
has to be entertaining,

50:50.214 --> 50:53.081
let me ask you a question. You
are Maya dolittle, correct?

50:53.217 --> 50:56.505
Of course I am. And Maya dolittle
wants to help animals, right?

50:56.595 --> 50:58.506
That's all I've ever
wanted to do.

50:58.597 --> 51:02.715
If Maya dolittle is involved in this show,
then how can it not be about helping animals?

51:02.810 --> 51:06.644
Maya dolittle helps animals!
That's what she does!

51:06.772 --> 51:10.765
Yeah. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
Of course it does.

51:10.859 --> 51:15.523
Now, look, I don't want you to worry
about any of this stuff, okay?

51:15.614 --> 51:18.572
I will not let anyone ruin...

51:18.659 --> 51:20.866
Your vision for this show.

51:20.995 --> 51:22.986
Okay, kiddo? Okay.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.537
'Cause I'm Rick Beverly.
See? That's what I do.

51:25.624 --> 51:28.491
Now, there is just one small
detail left to discuss.

51:28.627 --> 51:31.039
Not a big one, just a small one.
And what's that?

51:31.171 --> 51:33.162
That's my contract.
The contract?

51:33.257 --> 51:35.213
It's nothing
out of the ordinary.

51:35.301 --> 51:40.091
It just gives me permission to represent you
and to use your likeness, etcetera, etcetera.

51:40.180 --> 51:44.219
And there's a bunch of legal hoo-ha that you
don't have to concern yourself with at all.

51:44.310 --> 51:47.768
Tiff signed the exact same
thing when we started working together.

51:47.855 --> 51:51.347
- Isn't that right, tiff?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.398
Yeah, fun.

51:53.485 --> 51:57.103
Um, you know what?

51:57.197 --> 52:00.689
I think I should read it before I sign it.
Is that okay?

52:02.286 --> 52:04.197
Absolutely!

52:04.288 --> 52:06.950
Absolutely you should read
it before you sign it.

52:07.041 --> 52:10.033
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Wouldn't be right.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.618
You know what, Rick? We can worry
about all this stuff later.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.876
Maya and I have something way more
important we have to do first.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.708
- Like what?
- Celebrate.

52:18.802 --> 52:22.044
And there's only one way
I know how to do that.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.801
Jw

52:27.895 --> 52:31.638
Maybe I should have
saw those obscure signs

52:31.732 --> 52:33.393
j that you were giving me

52:33.484 --> 52:37.523
j maybe I should have
read between the lines

52:37.655 --> 52:39.611
j but I just didn't see

52:39.698 --> 52:41.654
j all those lies
you were making up

52:41.742 --> 52:45.451
j what good is a heart
if you ain't got no love

52:45.537 --> 52:48.279
j / saw those last dialed
numbers and now I know

52:48.374 --> 52:51.411
j he told me everything
that I wanted to know

52:51.502 --> 52:54.915
j so long, you go
get with your crew

52:55.005 --> 52:57.291
j you're no longer my baby-boo

52:57.383 --> 53:00.921
o adids, comprende c'est la vie

53:01.011 --> 53:03.172
j you can't get back with me

53:03.263 --> 53:06.630
j keep your memories, girl
that's all you get

53:06.725 --> 53:08.761
j / don't want you no more

53:08.852 --> 53:12.390
j hit the road
I told her, so now you split

53:13.482 --> 53:16.519
monkeys. We never
go out of style.

53:16.610 --> 53:18.191
J every moment
I tried to give you more

53:18.278 --> 53:20.690
j loved you way better
than the day before

53:20.823 --> 53:24.361
j screw you're sorry 'cause I
already know everything

53:24.451 --> 53:26.191
j so now you've got to go

53:26.286 --> 53:30.154
j so long, you go
get with your crew

53:30.249 --> 53:32.490
j you're no longer my baby-boo

53:32.584 --> 53:35.621
o adids, comprende c'est la vie

53:35.713 --> 53:39.080
j yeah, you can't
get back with me

53:39.174 --> 53:42.007
j you can't get back with me

53:42.094 --> 53:44.836
j you can't get back with me j,"

53:48.016 --> 53:50.758
wow! Celebrating is so much fun.

53:50.853 --> 53:54.391
Well, now that you're gonna stay out
here, we can do it, like, every weekend.

53:54.523 --> 53:56.434
Really? Mm-hmm.

53:56.525 --> 53:59.107
Wow! That would be so great.
But you know what?

53:59.194 --> 54:01.276
You've already done so much
for me already.

54:01.363 --> 54:04.901
I don't want to impose more
than I already have. - Hmm?

54:04.992 --> 54:08.054
Besides, you probably want to get back to
hanging out with your regular friends.

54:08.078 --> 54:10.364
Oh! Yeah, you are so right.

54:10.456 --> 54:12.993
Because I usually hang out
with them, like, every day.

54:13.083 --> 54:17.372
Sometimes I wish they wouldn't want to
hang out so much, but you know friends.

54:17.463 --> 54:20.330
They're just... so friendly.

54:22.217 --> 54:24.128
Js" oh.

54:25.804 --> 54:29.922
Sorry. I have to get this.
Don't use up all the sun.

54:30.017 --> 54:32.257
While you're up, bring me back
one of those fancy drinks.

54:32.311 --> 54:35.271
You know, the ones with the little
umbrellas in them. - Hello?

54:35.314 --> 54:37.976
“Friends.” good one.

54:38.066 --> 54:42.935
What did you say? - I said that was a
good one, about Tiffany having friends.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.736
What do you mean?

54:44.823 --> 54:46.859
I mean she doesn't.

54:46.950 --> 54:49.066
Wait. What are you
talking about?

54:49.161 --> 54:51.743
Who do I see her all the time
in the magazines with?

54:51.830 --> 54:54.412
She's always hanging out with
all kind of fabulous people.

54:54.500 --> 54:57.412
Photo ops,
staged for the cameras.

54:57.503 --> 54:59.664
She doesn't really know
any of those people.

54:59.755 --> 55:03.088
It's kinda sad,
if you think about it

55:03.175 --> 55:05.257
yeah.

55:05.344 --> 55:07.255
Sorry. That was Britney.

55:07.346 --> 55:10.634
She wanted to hang out,
but I told her I couldn't...

55:10.724 --> 55:13.932
Because I was hanging out
with my new best friend!

55:14.019 --> 55:16.852
- Poor kid.
- Hi, baby.

55:21.401 --> 55:24.313
I hope it isn't
who I think it is.

55:40.796 --> 55:42.787
Okay, people.

55:42.881 --> 55:45.247
The audience will be here
in less than three hours,

55:45.342 --> 55:47.924
so let's get cracking
on our first rehearsal, hmm?

55:48.011 --> 55:51.720
Look at you. You look dynamite.

55:51.807 --> 55:54.765
Now, all the celebrity pets
have arrived.

55:54.893 --> 55:56.849
You all ready for rehearsal?
Yep.

55:56.979 --> 55:58.890
Totally. Great.

55:58.981 --> 56:01.438
Then there's just one thing
to talk about-the contract.

56:01.567 --> 56:04.354
Did you get a chance to look at it?
Oh, no. I completely forgot.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.478
We've just been so busy. Has
anyone seen my soy frappe?

56:07.573 --> 56:09.859
Um, listen, this could be
a bit of a problem...

56:09.950 --> 56:12.032
Because before the cameras roll,

56:12.119 --> 56:14.826
we need your name
on the dotted line.

56:14.913 --> 56:18.997
But if you need a few more days
to read it, I guess that's okay.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.325
I'll just send
all these people home.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.331
Oh, no. Um-I'm gonna be on TV!

56:23.463 --> 56:27.047
I would sign it now, but I didn't bring
it with me. Oh, what a coincidence.

56:27.134 --> 56:30.922
- I have an extra one right here.
- Oh, okay.

56:31.013 --> 56:35.347
Well, if Tiffany signed the exact
same thing, it should be fine, right?

56:35.434 --> 56:39.393
- Right.
- Okay. There you go.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.183
Super.

56:42.274 --> 56:45.141
Now, let's dolittle it!

56:45.235 --> 56:48.898
Huh? You like that? I thought that
could be your new catchphrase.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.987
It's in the contract.

56:51.116 --> 56:55.405
Oh, wait. Oh, no. It's my mom.
Oh, great.

56:55.495 --> 56:58.032
I guess I have to finally tell
her what I've been doing.

56:58.165 --> 57:00.076
Yeah. I'll be up in a minute.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.283
Okay. Good stuff.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.284
Hello? Hey, Maya!

57:06.965 --> 57:10.048
Oh, no. No. Um, I haven't
gotten any of your messages.

57:10.135 --> 57:14.344
Maya, what is going on? You were
supposed to be home yesterday.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.969
Mom, I have to tell you something, and I
really need you to try to understand, okay?

57:18.060 --> 57:20.802
Uh-huh.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.012
I've decided
not to go to college...

57:23.106 --> 57:26.098
And just stay in Los Angeles and
do a TV show with Tiffany Monaco.

57:26.193 --> 57:28.275
You're what?

57:28.362 --> 57:32.605
Maya, I don't know what has come over you, but
we will talk about it later when you get home.

57:32.699 --> 57:37.113
Now, what you're going to do is pack your
bags and get to the airport tonight.

57:37.204 --> 57:41.288
I will have a ticket waiting for you.
Do you understand me?

57:41.375 --> 57:45.334
Look, mom, I've already
made up my mind,

57:45.420 --> 57:47.752
so you're just gonna
have to accept it.

57:47.839 --> 57:50.330
I gotta go. They're waiting
for me in rehearsal.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.416
I'll give you a call
a little bit later.

57:52.511 --> 57:55.878
Rehearsal? Maya, don't you dare
hang up that phone, young lady.

57:55.973 --> 57:58.931
Now, I am your mother,
and we will-Maya?

57:59.017 --> 58:01.258
Maya!

58:01.353 --> 58:03.560
That didn't sound like
it went really well.

58:03.647 --> 58:06.980
Uh, you can say that.

58:07.067 --> 58:10.059
But... she'll understand when
she sees the show, right?

58:10.153 --> 58:13.486
I mean, once she sees how much
good the show is gonna do, right?

58:13.573 --> 58:16.815
- Won't she?
- Sure! Sure she will. Yeah, of course.

58:16.952 --> 58:19.910
Don't give it a second thought.
Thanks, lucky.

58:19.997 --> 58:22.204
Now go out there
and break a leg.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.872
Rehearsal's on! And action!

58:24.876 --> 58:24.955
Rehearsal's on! And action!

58:25.043 --> 58:27.375
J»

58:34.094 --> 58:37.461
Hi, I'm Tiffany Monaco,
and this is my friend-

58:37.556 --> 58:41.014
Maya dolittle! And we would
like to welcome you to-

58:41.101 --> 58:42.887
the animal talkers!

58:42.978 --> 58:45.890
Today we're gonna talk
all about animal fashion!

58:46.023 --> 58:47.979
Isn't that right, Maya?
It sure is, tiff.

58:48.066 --> 58:52.901
And our first episode is all about
how to help our animals look good.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.570
It's going to be
such an amazing show.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.989
We have Hollywood heartthrob
Chad Cassidy.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.783
Hey, Emmy! I'm psyched
you guys could make it.

59:00.912 --> 59:04.200
You want a tour of the studio?
Sure, lucky. Thanks.

59:07.127 --> 59:10.415
Oh, you're still not feeling
well, are you? - Mm-mmm.

59:10.505 --> 59:13.212
Come on. I know a place
backstage where you can relax.

59:13.300 --> 59:17.384
“You know, tiff, our first guest is not only
one of the biggest Hollywood heartthrobs,

59:17.471 --> 59:20.383
but he also has one of the
biggest Hollywood hearts.”

59:20.474 --> 59:25.764
So let's give a big, warm animal
talkers welcome to Chad Cassidy.

59:25.854 --> 59:30.518
And his v.I.P-very important
pig, that is-chubster!

59:30.650 --> 59:32.481
Ju

59:37.240 --> 59:40.903
Chubster told Maya that when she's getting
ready to paint the town red with Chad Cassidy,

59:40.994 --> 59:42.825
she likes to think pink.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.824
That's right, Tiffany.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.657
And thanks to you and Maya,
we'll never clash again.

59:47.751 --> 59:50.959
Isn't that right, chubster?

59:53.423 --> 59:56.210
J» [continues I

59:56.301 --> 59:58.383
what is this? A fashion show?

59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.382
So now I think it's time for us
to bring out our next guest,

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:04.340
who happens to be
one of my favorites.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:10.096
J hey, yo. We
happy to be here, yall.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:13.182
Hey, Maya,
who's that hip-hopper?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:18.111
Girl, that is ridiculuz and his hare
with flair, Mr. fluffernufferman.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:21.565
We helped him find his inner mack
daddy with this hot ensemble.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.993
How do you like your new duds,
Mr. fluffernufferman?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:31.041
Really? Good one!
That was really funny.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:38.043
That was... amazing.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.046
Thank you. Okay, thank you.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:44.426
We're going to take five and reset for
the next rehearsal. Thank you, people.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:47.015
Roger, how was that?

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.802
Hey! So, what do you think? Hey.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:54.230
Well, I think...
I barely recognize you.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.775
No, not me. I'm talking about the show.
What do you think?

01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:01.947
The show? Uh, yeah, well, the
show-the show is interesting.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.740
Interesting?
Don't-don't you like it?

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:08.116
Well, I don't know. I guess-i
mean, it wasn't what I expected.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:11.118
I thought you wanted the show
to be about helping animals.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.827
Well, I did-1 do!
I mean, it is, isn't it?

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:17.833
Yeah, well, I don't know.
A pig in a tutu?

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.880
How does that
really help anyone?

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:24.086
Look, it's just a different kind of help,
you know? It still has to be entertaining.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.093
I guess I'm just
a little surprised, you know.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.722
When you first told me about the show, I
just pictured something more educational.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.428
Maya. Maya!

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.889
Wait, lucky. Hold on one second.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.904
I know the show has changed a little
bit from when I first heard about it,

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.478
but it's still all about
helping animals. Maya!

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:44.982
I mean, I'm Maya dolittle. All I
wanna do is help animals. Maya!

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:47.471
So, why would I be on a show that
isn't about helping animals?

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:50.237
Maya! Maya!
I really need to talk to you!

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:54.958
Lucky, hold on a minute! Are you sure
this is what you want to be doing?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.502
Maya, listen to me!
Emmy needs help!

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:00.456
Lucky, I said hold-
wait. What did you say?

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.542
I think Emmy is really sick. You
better come take a look at her.

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:06.670
Oh, no. What's the matter?
Where are you going?

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.347
Lucky said he thinks there's
something wrong with Emmy.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.141
Emmy? Yeah, come on.

It's bordetella. It's actually
fairly easy to diagnose.

The symptoms are quickly identifiable-
fatigue, loss of appetite.

Fatigue and loss of appetite.
The test confirmed it

most dogs are vaccinated for it when they're
puppies, but for some reason she wasn't.

told me that she had all her shots.

have checked, huh?

caught it when you did and brought her in.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.770
Fork over that contract!

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.781
Bull's-eye.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:24.411
Why, you little-

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.993
- that's it for you.
- Uh-oh.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.712
All right.
Easy there, big fella.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.716
This town's not big
enough for the two of us.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:42.016
You know what I want
and I'm here to get it.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.407
Here I come, city boy!

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:11.954
Everything's cool.
Everything's cool.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.638
Chicken'

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:22.386
yee-hah!

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:36.862
Whoa!

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.321
Oww/

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.159
Huh?

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:52.370
Cut! [ Crew chattering I

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.918
thanks, buddy.
You ruined the take.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:57.341
[ Laughi 2 ghing I

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:02.013
sorry, everyone.
Um, wow. Looks great

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.465
movies-love 'em.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.643
Mummies-spooky.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:12.981
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.151
Um, hey, there's-

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.283
wind here if you guys need it.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:28.615
W-w-whoa!

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.825
Have a nice trip. Bye-bye.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.831
Aaah!

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.789
- Look! Lucky, there he is!
- After him!

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.166
Huh?

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:53.098
Maya! This way!

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:03.325
There he is!
Time for warp speed!

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:09.697
Ape-pollo 13,
scene 16, take two.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.828
Action!

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.830
My oxygen sensors indicate...

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:17.379
The atmosphere on this alien
planet is totally breathable.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.377
What do you think, monkey?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.502
Cut! Brilliant.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.755
I feel so cheap.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:31.852
Lucky, hurry! He's getting away!

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:36.558
Looks like Maya needs me! And I think
perhaps I need my dignity back.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:41.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey! Get that
monkey back here, or he's finished!

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:44.611
Ah, who cares? What I really
want to do is direct.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:52.031
Whoa!

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:55.289
Gotcha!

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.712
Slow and steady wins the race.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.710
You stupid bunch of animals.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:05.386
You think you can make a fool out of Rick
Beverly? You'll never get this contract.

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:08.339
Think again, blondie.
Finders keepers!

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:10.720
Hey! Monkey! Get back here!

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.354
Monkey, what are you doing here?

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.272
Oh, I was just
in the neighborhood and I-

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.600
hey! Give that back to monkey!

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.402
Come on.

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:26.482
Oh, Monaco. Good job.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:30.786
Did I ever tell you
you are my favorite client?

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:33.159
Now hand it over:

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:39.371
Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna do that, Rick.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:42.047
Excuse me?

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.924
What a friend would do is-

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.926
ah-ah-ah! Whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:52.508
Monaco, before you do something
that you might regret,

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:55.345
remember, I still own you.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:57.771
Your name still belongs to me.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:01.600
You know what? You can have it.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.441
Ohh!

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:07.693
It's not even my real name.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.821
You- and you!

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.200
Y- you will never work
in this town again.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.281
None of you!

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.367
I'll make sure of that!

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:20.453
You call yourself a shark?
/"m a shark!

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.708
Ah, bite me.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.212
Oh, Tiffany, thank you so much.

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:28.920
Hey, I'm the one that
got you into this whole mess.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.756
The least I could do is
help you get out of it, right?

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.637
Well, she's not the only
one who got you into it.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.102
I mean, uh-what? What
do you mean, lucky?

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:40.431
I encouraged you to go to los
Angeles to do the show...

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.233
Even though I knew it probably
wasn't the best thing for you.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.233
You did? Why? - Because I didn't
want you to go away to school.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:50.816
You're my best friend, Maya.
I don't want to lose you.

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:54.324
It's okay, lucky. I understand.

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:56.246
But you don't have to worry,

01:19:56.333 --> 01:20:00.702
because no matter where I go or what I'm
doing, we will always be best friends.

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:02.749
Okay? Deal.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.757
Maya? Uh-oh.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:08.800
Mom?

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.338
Mom. Wait.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.387
Before you say anything, please
let me explain myself. Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:19.390
I know I messed up. I know this
TV show was a stupid idea.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.393
It was just a shortcut,
and I realize that now.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.817
All I want to do is go to vet school,
no matter how long it takes.

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:28.232
Helping the animals will be worth it.
I know.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.737
Mom, I know you're mad at me, and I'm
sorry because I should have called, but-

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.738
wait. What did you say?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.992
Maya, I saw the whole thing.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:40.370
I am... so proud of you.

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:42.167
Thank you, mom.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.455
So, do we still have time
to make it to registration?

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.461
We could try.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.043
Uh, hello?
Private jet, remember?

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.171
Let's go.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:21:01.137
And so that's the story of
how Maya dolittle started vet school

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:04.314
let me tell you,
it was a close one, all right.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:08.314
But you know what? It all
turned out all right n the end.

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.396
And as for me-

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:16.739
hey, what can I say? She's
my best friend. Aw!

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:22.075
Did you really think I was just gonna
let her go off to college without me?

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:25.627
But I wasn't the only surprise
Maya got at college.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.626
Remember that Brandon guy?

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:31.250
Surprise. Huh?

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:35.634
He decided to finally take that time
off from Hollywood and go to college.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.761
- And where do you think he applied?
- I can't believe it!

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:43.141
And since Brandon was there,
guess who else showed up?

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:48.351
So, 1 guess it all
worked out in the end.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:51.187
Boy, Hollywood sure is
one crazy place,

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:54.773
and it's probably best we all
got it out of our systems.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:57.280
Well almost all of us.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:59.407
And cut!

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:02.365
All right, everyone,
that's a wrap!

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:07.249
Now, will someone please
bring me a banana latte?
