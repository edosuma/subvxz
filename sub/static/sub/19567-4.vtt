WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.569
Previously on The Arrangement

00:01.609 --> 00:04.498
I'm going to Oslo. It's
the only way to stop this.

00:04.523 --> 00:07.290
What makes you think
that you can stop it?

00:07.359 --> 00:08.425
That was amazing.

00:08.494 --> 00:10.393
You are amazing.

00:10.418 --> 00:12.152
Have you looked at the
language in this contract?

00:12.176 --> 00:14.877
He's expecting you to be
the perfect girlfriend.

00:14.921 --> 00:16.303
You and I have a secret,

00:16.328 --> 00:18.135
so unless you want me
to tell people about it,

00:18.203 --> 00:20.070
we better start talking
about a new deal.

00:20.139 --> 00:22.105
- What's your name?
- Annika.

00:22.174 --> 00:23.907
You're the truth.

00:23.976 --> 00:26.209
That's the only thing I care about.

00:27.446 --> 00:28.836
Look, now the studio owes me,

00:28.861 --> 00:30.568
so they're gonna have to
let me direct the next movie.

00:30.592 --> 00:32.593
That was your tradeoff
for getting rid of me.

00:32.618 --> 00:35.986
I have a missing persons
case. Sophie Marchuk.

00:36.054 --> 00:39.389
Okay. I screwed this up.
I love you. That's it.

00:47.466 --> 00:49.432
What are you doing?

00:49.501 --> 00:53.336
I'm going to Oslo. It's
the only way to stop this.

00:53.405 --> 00:56.139
What makes you think you can stop it?

00:57.242 --> 00:58.453
You know, even if you make it there,

00:58.477 --> 01:00.299
you won't survive.

01:01.079 --> 01:04.244
The agency has a kill
plan. It's already in place.

01:06.118 --> 01:07.584
How do you know?

01:14.326 --> 01:16.266
How do you know?

01:20.751 --> 01:23.533
- Sorry, sorry, can we just go again?
- Okay, cut.

01:24.803 --> 01:25.947
Get the glycerin drops.

01:25.972 --> 01:28.038
Maybe I could just
make a different choice.

01:28.106 --> 01:30.607
She's scared. Maybe...
maybe I don't have to cry.

01:30.676 --> 01:32.409
Scared is not an
expression of this moment.

01:32.469 --> 01:33.777
I need tears.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.378
And can we expose her eyes a bit more?

01:35.447 --> 01:37.147
All right, let's take ten!

01:39.491 --> 01:40.757
You okay?

01:40.782 --> 01:43.131
I don't know why I'm having such
a hard time with this moment.

01:43.155 --> 01:45.622
I'm sorry, the "Vanity Fair"
person wants to push till 2:00.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.846
Yes.

01:47.893 --> 01:50.116
Stay with it. You'll get there.

01:54.349 --> 01:55.686
This is going well.

01:55.711 --> 01:57.249
Well, you're finding some great moments.

01:57.273 --> 01:58.382
That's because I'm remembering

01:58.406 --> 01:59.814
what it was like to do it with Megan.

01:59.838 --> 02:01.571
She nailed this, remember?

02:01.640 --> 02:02.889
Now she's not even talking to me.

02:02.913 --> 02:04.441
Well, she can't just not talk to you.

02:04.509 --> 02:05.887
That doesn't make me feel any better.

02:05.911 --> 02:07.287
Look, the camera loves Amelia.

02:07.312 --> 02:08.590
She'll be fine, and
Megan will get over it.

02:08.614 --> 02:10.513
She'll get over it? Really?

02:11.917 --> 02:13.107
You guys seem good.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.766
Nothing but love for you. I
got nothing but love for you.

02:16.279 --> 02:17.954
Brandon Drake?

02:18.023 --> 02:19.456
Did you invite him down?

02:19.524 --> 02:21.336
I'm working with him on the
life-after-sports program

02:21.360 --> 02:22.553
for pro athletes.

02:22.578 --> 02:24.160
Yeah? Where are you at with that?

02:24.229 --> 02:26.196
Well, we haven't talked since the ESPYs.

02:26.265 --> 02:28.865
He's been busy. We both are.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.001
Bright kid. Family man, natural leader.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.881
I thought he'd do more
after the intro workshop.

02:32.905 --> 02:35.256
I'm trying. At least he's here.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.784
Yeah, hopefully, he'll
stick around this time.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.031
If we could get the Institute a
presence in those locker rooms...

02:39.055 --> 02:40.280
Dude, I know.

02:40.305 --> 02:41.756
Hey, why don't you
come hang out with us?

02:41.780 --> 02:43.411
We're actually gonna get a workout in.

02:43.436 --> 02:46.232
Yeah, no, I don't want
to shake anyone's confidence.

02:48.069 --> 02:49.589
Listen, Kyle, I know the circumstances

02:49.637 --> 02:51.081
aren't perfect, but look
at what you're doing here.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.505
Application, recruitment.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.106
Building my column.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.509
Yeah, exactly where you want to be.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.713
- There he is.
- Hey.

03:00.782 --> 03:02.548
- Hey.
- What's up, champ?

03:02.617 --> 03:04.710
Thanks for coming by.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.854
Actors get replaced all the time.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.657
Ryan Gosling was
replaced by Mark Wahlberg

03:11.710 --> 03:13.943
in "The Lovely Bones"
after he gained 50 pounds

03:14.028 --> 03:16.495
for the part, so you
shouldn't blame Kyle.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.665
I'm not blaming him. I'm
just taking some time.

03:19.734 --> 03:22.964
Listen, you signed a $10 million
contract to be with the guy.

03:22.989 --> 03:26.472
Now you won't talk to
him, so you are in breach.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.073
Breach? Where does it say

03:28.142 --> 03:30.283
I can't take some time to myself?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.812
"Partner must maintain"

03:32.880 --> 03:35.047
"regular communication with Kyle West."

03:35.116 --> 03:38.838
"Partner may not avoid or ignore
attempts to communicate by Kyle West."

03:38.863 --> 03:40.487
"If partner intentionally allows"

03:40.512 --> 03:43.838
"communication with Kyle West
to lapse in excess of three days,"

03:43.863 --> 03:45.350
"partner may be held in breach."

03:45.419 --> 03:47.285
I only get three days?

03:47.354 --> 03:51.122
At $5,480 per, so buck up.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.180
Please don't quote that number again.

03:53.293 --> 03:55.558
- Could we talk business?
- This is business.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.917
And I will call him.

03:58.231 --> 03:59.564
Did you read the play?

03:59.633 --> 04:01.446
No, I didn't read the play.

04:01.471 --> 04:03.868
You shouldn't have either,
but my lovely assistant

04:03.937 --> 04:06.471
decided to think outside
the box and send it to you.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.573
Mia! You're fired!

04:08.642 --> 04:10.141
Okay.

04:11.306 --> 04:13.578
It's literally the only
decent thing I've read.

04:13.647 --> 04:16.040
Everyone is still waiting to
see how you're gonna handle this,

04:16.064 --> 04:19.050
so you can make the smart,
unflappable choice...

04:19.119 --> 04:22.253
like the recurring role
in "NCIS: New Orleans"...

04:22.322 --> 04:24.956
or you can wallow in your
own shit and do a play.

04:25.025 --> 04:27.892
When I signed the contract,
Leslie, you told me I would have

04:27.961 --> 04:29.439
the money and the freedom
to do whatever I wanted.

04:29.463 --> 04:31.029
- Megan...
- You said that exact thing,

04:31.098 --> 04:32.991
- whatever I wanted, and...
- Megan.

04:33.016 --> 04:36.518
If our first move after getting
dumped from a Kyle West movie

04:36.543 --> 04:40.007
is a play, I will be the butt of jokes.

04:40.032 --> 04:41.983
Literally the butt of jokes.

04:42.008 --> 04:43.346
Come on, Les.

04:43.371 --> 04:46.472
Everyone knows you're an amazing agent.

04:46.769 --> 04:48.917
I hate you. Get out.

04:52.252 --> 04:54.378
- I'll call you.
- Love you.

05:00.227 --> 05:02.093
Holy shit.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.561
What?

05:03.646 --> 05:05.112
It's Megan Morrison.

05:05.165 --> 05:07.799
Daisy? What are you doing in L.A.?

05:07.868 --> 05:08.933
Come here.

05:09.002 --> 05:10.335
Hey.

05:10.403 --> 05:12.137
My agents put a gun to my head.

05:12.205 --> 05:13.271
Their office is upstairs.

05:13.340 --> 05:14.906
My God, mine too.

05:14.975 --> 05:17.510
You have no idea how happy
I am to see you right now.

05:17.535 --> 05:19.978
Me too. I have to ask you, though.

05:20.046 --> 05:22.947
Why didn't you tell me in
Venice who your boyfriend is?

05:23.016 --> 05:25.016
I just...

05:25.085 --> 05:26.689
I don't know, I wanted
you to think of me

05:26.714 --> 05:30.082
as the chick from the town
next to yours. It's simpler.

05:30.107 --> 05:32.307
So it's actually a real relationship?

05:32.579 --> 05:34.145
Of course it's real.

05:34.178 --> 05:36.394
Okay. No, it's just...
I read in "Variety"

05:36.463 --> 05:39.291
you got booted off his movie,
and I just don't understand

05:39.316 --> 05:41.499
how that happens if
you're really together,

05:41.568 --> 05:43.469
- or maybe it's just Hollywood.
- You read the trades?

05:43.493 --> 05:45.752
Hey... I hate-read.

05:45.777 --> 05:47.534
Well, I'm sure "Variety" tells the story

05:47.559 --> 05:49.440
much better than I do.

05:49.509 --> 05:50.920
Is it cool if we don't talk about it?

05:50.944 --> 05:52.255
I just... I wouldn't mind taking a break

05:52.279 --> 05:54.783
from the whole celebrity
girlfriend thing.

05:54.808 --> 05:56.150
Okay.

05:57.784 --> 06:00.305
Do you want to on an
adventure with me instead?

06:00.385 --> 06:01.969
God, yes.

06:02.423 --> 06:05.805
Cool. I am going to show you...

06:05.926 --> 06:07.859
- what I'm getting into...
- You're scar...

06:07.928 --> 06:10.228
- for my next film.
- You're scaring me right now.

06:10.297 --> 06:11.396
Come on.

06:16.636 --> 06:19.130
Hey. Yeah, we're here.

06:20.317 --> 06:21.706
Okay.

06:21.775 --> 06:23.122
All right, bye.

06:23.856 --> 06:26.444
I don't feel nervous,
but my knees are shaking.

06:26.513 --> 06:28.446
It's called being alive, sister.

06:28.515 --> 06:30.248
Marcus!

06:30.317 --> 06:31.950
Hey.

06:32.018 --> 06:34.319
Okay. Come here. What's going on?

06:36.777 --> 06:38.743
Marcus was the DP on my thesis film.

06:38.812 --> 06:40.479
Now he's got a kid,
he's gotta make bank.

06:40.547 --> 06:42.514
Isn't that true? This's my friend Megan.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.816
Nice to meet you. Come
on, I'll bring you in.

06:44.885 --> 06:47.586
Normally we don't have
visitors, so just be cool.

06:55.596 --> 06:57.105
So this is the crime scene.

06:57.130 --> 06:58.930
Okay, I'm hard. Let's go.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.632
Where we at?

07:00.701 --> 07:03.201
- Okay, this is really happening.
- Yeah.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.019
- Who are they?
- My friends, good people.

07:08.108 --> 07:10.275
Okay. Welcome.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.144
Okay, people, quiet on the set.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.624
I just want to tell
stories about real people,

07:16.649 --> 07:18.046
you know what I mean?

07:18.071 --> 07:21.786
And porn is just real in a way
that Hollywood can never be.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.722
- Yeah, this is real.
- Yeah.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.490
Ready? You're ready.

07:25.559 --> 07:26.870
I just want a way in that
hasn't been done before.

07:26.894 --> 07:28.727
I'm gonna come down to you this way.

07:28.795 --> 07:30.473
- That's pretty good.
- Does this read? It's good?

07:30.497 --> 07:32.175
- Yeah, yeah, it's really good.
- Let's check it.

07:32.199 --> 07:33.598
My God!

07:34.468 --> 07:37.681
Hi. Are you Megan Morrison?

07:37.845 --> 07:39.938
I'm Megan Whore-ison.

07:40.007 --> 07:41.484
Wha...

07:41.509 --> 07:44.752
Sorry, no, I'm Brenna, but I play you

07:44.777 --> 07:47.412
in the porn version of your life!

07:47.481 --> 07:49.247
My God!

07:49.272 --> 07:51.706
My God, what are you doing here?

07:51.731 --> 07:52.951
Please don't leave!

07:53.020 --> 07:55.287
It's amazing. Okay, I'm ready.

07:55.918 --> 07:57.451
Okay.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.711
- What?
- I don't know.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:12.839 --> 08:14.773
Just watched live porn.

08:14.841 --> 08:16.741
I can cross that off my list.

08:16.810 --> 08:18.510
Your list of what?

08:18.579 --> 08:19.976
Megan?

08:20.665 --> 08:22.663
- Hey. God.
- Hi.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.351
I have to say, I was
totally meant to play you.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.953
I believe it.

08:28.013 --> 08:31.248
- Why do you say that?
- Because I was an actress too.

08:32.423 --> 08:35.327
Like small parts in movies
and guest spots on TV,

08:35.395 --> 08:36.895
just crappy stuff.

08:36.964 --> 08:40.465
It was really hard on
my self esteem, you know?

08:40.765 --> 08:43.101
Felt like I was depressed all the time.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.770
Then one day, I was broke, again,

08:45.839 --> 08:49.274
and, um, one of my girlfriends
who had done porn was like,

08:49.343 --> 08:52.944
"Brenna, I tried this, and it's amazing."

08:53.013 --> 08:54.412
"You should totally do it."

08:54.481 --> 08:55.481
And that was it?

08:55.549 --> 08:57.082
- Kind of.
- Whoa.

08:57.150 --> 09:01.052
I was scared at first,
but then I was like, okay,

09:01.121 --> 09:03.989
I love having sex and I hate dating,

09:04.041 --> 09:07.446
so why not get paid to do
the thing that I really like?

09:08.528 --> 09:11.796
Also, everyone treats me so nice here.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.347
Like, I show up and people cater to me.

09:14.401 --> 09:16.968
It's incredible. I work whenever I want.

09:17.037 --> 09:20.455
I am a bona fide movie star on this set.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.409
So, porn saved your life.

09:23.644 --> 09:25.043
Yeah.

09:25.104 --> 09:28.136
It's kind of like my
own personal Kyle West.

09:28.161 --> 09:30.464
I-I wouldn't say that Kyle saved me.

09:30.489 --> 09:32.951
- I didn't...
- Brenna?

09:33.020 --> 09:34.619
Yes?

09:34.680 --> 09:37.781
Okay. That is my cue.

09:37.858 --> 09:39.424
I'm so glad that you guys came.

09:39.493 --> 09:41.745
Group hug...

09:43.396 --> 09:45.688
If you ever want to hang out,

09:45.713 --> 09:48.417
I'm always at The Cobalt on Thursdays,

09:48.442 --> 09:49.925
- like clockwork. Yeah?
- Sweet.

09:49.950 --> 09:53.581
- Is that a strip club?
- No, no, karaoke bar.

09:53.606 --> 09:56.308
- See you later.
- Bye.

09:57.911 --> 10:01.179
That is your way in...
"Porn saved my life"?

10:01.248 --> 10:02.847
It totally blows up the stereotype.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.550
Dude, I was literally just
thinking the same thing.

10:05.575 --> 10:07.205
- She's not a victim.
- No.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.520
She's not oppressed.

10:08.588 --> 10:10.628
I mean, everyone says porn
is so degrading to women,

10:10.691 --> 10:11.823
but that girl's empowered.

10:11.892 --> 10:13.425
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

10:14.661 --> 10:16.728
We gotta develop this together.

10:16.797 --> 10:18.763
- Are you serious?
- Hell yeah.

10:18.867 --> 10:22.406
You're smart, we think
alike, and you get her.

10:22.569 --> 10:24.502
Let's get you away from
the Hollywood bullshit.

10:24.571 --> 10:26.789
We can create some art.

10:32.314 --> 10:34.705
Shaun, it was bizarre.

10:34.712 --> 10:38.031
And I'm thinking, "Wow, there
but for the grace of God go I."

10:38.056 --> 10:40.690
But then I realize
that no one tells Brenna

10:40.759 --> 10:42.725
- what job she can or can't do.
- Stop.

10:42.794 --> 10:44.694
No one tells her when
to call her boyfriend.

10:44.763 --> 10:47.899
She doesn't have a boyfriend
and she probably never will.

10:47.930 --> 10:49.496
Well, you get my point.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.200
Of course I do.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.884
But...

10:53.372 --> 10:55.372
we went over the terms of the contract

10:55.397 --> 10:57.868
before you signed it.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.324
You've got a beautiful boyfriend.

11:00.349 --> 11:02.783
You've got money in the bank.

11:02.808 --> 11:05.108
Why not focus on the possibilities

11:05.133 --> 11:07.834
in your life instead of the limitations?

11:07.859 --> 11:10.030
Since when are you so "glass half-full"?

11:10.055 --> 11:13.235
Your glass is more than half full.

11:13.918 --> 11:16.518
Get back to Kyle and move forward.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.519
I want to.

11:19.316 --> 11:22.131
I'm just waiting for the
shitty feelings to go away.

11:23.768 --> 11:24.968
- I get it.
- Hold on, hold on.

11:25.003 --> 11:26.527
I've got to get this. Hi.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.433
So, I've been on the
phone for over an hour,

11:29.458 --> 11:32.715
and unfortunately, the playwright
you think is so great...

11:32.740 --> 11:35.207
he refuses to "stunt-cast" the part.

11:35.232 --> 11:37.999
Wait, so I can't do "The Kill Plan"

11:38.024 --> 11:40.291
because I'm not famous enough,
and I can't do this play

11:40.316 --> 11:41.983
because the guy thinks I'm too famous?

11:42.008 --> 11:44.378
No, he thinks you're a
movie star's girlfriend

11:44.403 --> 11:47.604
whose biggest claim to fame is
some naked pictures of herself

11:47.673 --> 11:49.541
that she leaked onto the Internet.

11:49.566 --> 11:52.509
Sweetie, he is a douche bag.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.812
Could we look on the bright side?

12:04.723 --> 12:07.558
So I figured we need three or
four guys from different teams,

12:07.626 --> 12:10.160
you know, guys who are
good in the locker room,

12:10.229 --> 12:11.673
guys who can bring other
guys into the Institute.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.847
Yeah, l-like, I got you, man, I got ya.

12:13.872 --> 12:15.866
I will... I'll reach out, all right?

12:15.935 --> 12:18.268
Just my first off-season in five years

12:18.337 --> 12:21.205
I haven't had a surgery, and
I-I got people all over me.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.774
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, nonstop.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.076
Yeah. Glad you're healthy though.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.879
You seem good too, brah.
Man, at the ESPYs, though,

12:28.948 --> 12:31.849
you were seriously in your
feelings about Lisbeth.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.320
Time heals?

12:33.345 --> 12:34.785
I met someone new.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.054
I never would cheat on Claudia, but...

12:37.123 --> 12:41.595
you know, when we broke up for
a few months my rookie year,

12:41.927 --> 12:45.556
I was in the club every
night trying to numb my pain.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.632
Yeah. Every time I bring
a girl home from the club,

12:48.701 --> 12:51.668
she ends up in the
tabloids. Not a good look.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.842
So how you take care of your business?

12:55.561 --> 12:58.075
I had an arrangement with someone.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.610
"With someone"?

12:59.678 --> 13:01.178
You mean, like, one girl?

13:01.247 --> 13:03.847
Technically one girl, but...

13:03.916 --> 13:06.287
but she would do a lot
of different things.

13:06.732 --> 13:08.919
So an arrangement. So
what, she would, like...

13:08.988 --> 13:10.754
would come to your
house whenever you want,

13:10.823 --> 13:12.256
something like that?

13:12.324 --> 13:14.024
She lived here.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.095
Come on now. You had yourself a live-in?

13:18.343 --> 13:20.531
Straight up sex, nothing else?

13:20.599 --> 13:21.914
Straight up.

13:21.939 --> 13:23.712
I didn't even have to see
her if I didn't want to.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.125
Ooh, damn!

13:25.172 --> 13:26.703
You gave up a live-in!

13:26.772 --> 13:28.305
Man, you must like this new girl?

13:28.374 --> 13:31.869
Yeah. Megan. I love her.

13:32.802 --> 13:34.486
All right.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.862
So when do I get to meet her?

13:38.217 --> 13:41.385
Well, soon as she decides
to start talking to me again.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.221
Live-in!

13:47.660 --> 13:50.994
Damn! I love Hollywood!

13:55.936 --> 13:57.676
I heard you were here.

14:11.088 --> 14:14.048
I thought this was a room
where I could find some peace.

14:14.970 --> 14:17.254
We have rooms for that at home,

14:17.323 --> 14:19.896
but you chose to come here
to get a reaction from me.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.693
Well, I certainly deserve one.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.044
So you're keeping score?

14:25.231 --> 14:26.530
Don't do that.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.065
I just wish you'd be direct.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.200
Direct? Really, Terence,

14:30.269 --> 14:33.036
you know, you are not an
easy man to be married to,

14:33.061 --> 14:35.639
and I have figured out
how to deal with your shit,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.274
but when you place your shit

14:37.343 --> 14:39.176
in front of my professional interest...

14:39.245 --> 14:40.344
- My shit?
- Yes.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.923
You have a stick up
your ass about Megan,

14:41.947 --> 14:43.614
so you undermined my
vision for the movie.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.549
I made a smart business decision.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.851
Amelia Briggs really
helps us at the box office.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.387
I'm the producer, Terence, not you.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.889
You stepped into my lane,
you went behind my back,

14:52.958 --> 14:54.603
and you cut a deal without
even discussing it...

14:54.627 --> 14:56.460
Okay, okay. I'm clear
on why you're upset,

14:56.528 --> 15:00.040
but I can't undo what I've
done, so tell me how to fix it.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.525
I don't know how to fix this.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.517
And I'm not gonna figure it out for you.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.277
You have to do the work this time.

15:28.003 --> 15:29.950
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

15:29.995 --> 15:31.728
I'm waiting for you, Brenna.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.964
You don't have any clothes on.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.767
Whoops.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.303
Jimmy, we shouldn't do this.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.772
My boyfriend's gonna be so mad.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.321
We should probably just make it
worthwhile then, shouldn't we?

15:44.346 --> 15:46.777
I think you should get over here.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.445
Here?

15:48.789 --> 15:50.758
Little closer.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.547
Here?

16:00.079 --> 16:01.148
Hi.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.334
You picked up. You
finally want to talk to me?

16:04.359 --> 16:07.226
There really isn't anything new to say.

16:08.429 --> 16:09.733
I guess I just picked up

16:09.802 --> 16:12.303
because I'm tired of feeling
the same way about it.

16:12.328 --> 16:14.571
I wish I could just
hit the rewind button,

16:14.640 --> 16:16.440
go back to the way we were before.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.012
You wish you were here?

16:22.081 --> 16:25.951
I can come over. You
know, if you want me to.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.620
What time is your call in the morning?

16:30.689 --> 16:32.819
Early.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.129
I kind of like talking to you like this.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.270
Talking to me like what?

16:42.598 --> 16:44.473
So what are you doing?

16:45.958 --> 16:47.425
I'm watching porn.

16:47.450 --> 16:48.672
Seriously?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.140
It's research.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.042
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's always research.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.578
Yeah, I know. I ran into Daisy,

16:54.646 --> 16:57.848
that filmmaker from Venice,
and she wants to make a movie

16:57.916 --> 16:59.950
set in the porn world,
and she asked me to help.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.752
So here I am helping.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.053
Yeah?

17:03.122 --> 17:05.255
Tell me about the one you're watching.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.390
Is it any good?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.810
It's pretty good, yeah.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.794
What happens?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.840
This girl goes to her boyfriend's house,

17:13.866 --> 17:17.401
but his best friend's there,
and he's really into her.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.169
Then what?

17:19.238 --> 17:20.707
Then you called.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.659
Do you want to turn it back on?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.238
Okay.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.625
So tell me what's happening now.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.327
He's behind her.

17:44.675 --> 17:47.129
He's kissing her neck.

17:47.154 --> 17:48.923
He's feeling her breasts.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.000
Then what?

17:50.068 --> 17:52.803
Yes.

17:53.363 --> 17:57.541
Her hand unzips his pants.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.477
Good, it's about time.

18:04.714 --> 18:06.644
Then what?

18:07.418 --> 18:10.113
Now his fingers are inside of her.

18:10.746 --> 18:12.563
Does it feel good?

18:12.632 --> 18:15.394
Feels so good.

18:16.919 --> 18:19.052
You're teasing me.

18:19.077 --> 18:21.201
Tell me what you want.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.566
You know what I want.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.980
Say it.

18:32.615 --> 18:34.691
I want all of you.

18:35.188 --> 18:37.785
I want all of you inside of me.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.600
Yeah. Just...

18:46.433 --> 18:48.166
This is crazy.

18:56.021 --> 18:57.787
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:57.857 --> 18:59.623
Um, are you doing porn?

18:59.691 --> 19:02.501
What? Am I doing porn? No.

19:02.526 --> 19:03.760
Why are you asking?

19:03.828 --> 19:06.464
I think you should check Celebscoop.

19:11.736 --> 19:14.503
All right.

19:19.610 --> 19:22.470
My God. Um...

19:22.914 --> 19:25.248
okay, it doesn't say I'm doing porn.

19:25.317 --> 19:28.351
Then what are you doing
hanging out on a porn set

19:28.420 --> 19:29.719
with porn stars?

19:29.788 --> 19:31.657
For research.

19:31.682 --> 19:34.350
Never mind, I'm not doing porn.

19:34.852 --> 19:37.046
Of course, after the photo leak,

19:37.071 --> 19:38.937
everybody's gonna think I am.

19:38.962 --> 19:40.023
Okay, well,

19:40.048 --> 19:41.809
did you ever find out
who did leak those photos?

19:41.833 --> 19:43.820
No, not yet.

19:46.271 --> 19:47.813
Hold on.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.041
Hope, I gotta call you back.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.338
Okay, well, I wanna hang
out soon. I miss you.

19:54.363 --> 19:55.580
Bye.

19:59.084 --> 20:00.983
I'm not doing porn,
so I'm not in breach.

20:01.052 --> 20:04.687
I'm developing a project
about porn as a producer.

20:04.712 --> 20:06.189
Croissant?

20:15.467 --> 20:17.345
I spoke to Kyle... he
told me about your project.

20:17.369 --> 20:18.568
I'm not here to threaten you.

20:18.636 --> 20:20.603
You talked to Kyle this morning?

20:20.740 --> 20:22.943
I talk to Kyle every morning.

20:23.308 --> 20:25.875
Look, Megan, the Institute
isn't about prudishness.

20:25.944 --> 20:28.340
Straight, gay, bi, trans, whatever.

20:28.365 --> 20:30.813
Anything between two
consenting adults is beautiful,

20:30.882 --> 20:34.418
but porn is a fake version of sex.

20:34.443 --> 20:36.319
It's the act without the intimacy.

20:36.388 --> 20:38.529
I know what it is.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.365
Did you really come all the way
from the Westside to tell me that?

20:43.027 --> 20:45.106
I came to tell you that
you've disconnected from Kyle

20:45.130 --> 20:47.730
and connected with a world
where feelings don't matter,

20:47.799 --> 20:49.565
and that's a big problem.

20:49.634 --> 20:50.994
He's done too much work on himself

20:51.035 --> 20:52.935
to last in a relationship
without intimacy.

20:53.004 --> 20:55.605
Believe it or not, I want intimacy too.

20:55.681 --> 20:58.816
I would just like to trust
the person I'm having it with.

20:58.877 --> 21:00.317
You're waiting for some kind of sign

21:00.345 --> 21:02.311
that Kyle will catch you.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.781
You only get that if you
jump. That's how it works.

21:05.859 --> 21:08.740
No, that's how a trust fall works.

21:10.388 --> 21:13.356
And if you wait too
long, people wander off...

21:13.425 --> 21:15.168
'cause they get bored.

21:26.905 --> 21:29.005
Shit.

21:33.047 --> 21:34.835
What are you doing here?

21:35.812 --> 21:37.380
I'm sure you don't like surprises.

21:37.449 --> 21:39.515
I just wanted to see you in person.

21:39.584 --> 21:41.317
Yeah, you're right, I
don't like surprises.

21:41.386 --> 21:44.287
Look, I was angry last time we spoke,

21:44.355 --> 21:46.222
mostly at myself.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.545
I just... I gave myself
away when we made that deal.

21:49.570 --> 21:50.970
I need to fix that.

21:50.995 --> 21:53.362
Okay, Annika, I don't know

21:53.431 --> 21:55.231
what more you expect me to do for you.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.233
I don't expect you to do anything.

21:57.302 --> 21:58.601
You were right.

21:58.670 --> 22:00.885
I don't want to threaten
somebody like you.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.206
I want somebody like you to respect me.

22:03.274 --> 22:06.691
That's why I'm asking
if you'll read this.

22:07.312 --> 22:08.778
You wrote a screenplay?

22:08.839 --> 22:10.972
It's been my baby for
the last two years.

22:11.049 --> 22:12.748
I'm not an actress.

22:12.817 --> 22:15.151
I don't want to pretend that anymore.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.653
Will you give me an
honest opinion of this?

22:17.722 --> 22:20.256
Of course, but right now,

22:20.325 --> 22:22.158
I have another meeting
that I am late for.

22:22.227 --> 22:24.927
Okay, well, maybe today or tonight then.

22:24.996 --> 22:26.555
You know what, I'm swamped,

22:26.601 --> 22:28.509
but I will read it and I
will definitely call you.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.022
Okay, well, I'd like to know when.

22:30.047 --> 22:32.768
Okay, look, I have an
extremely busy schedule,

22:32.837 --> 22:34.670
so I won't be nailed
down to a specific date.

22:34.731 --> 22:36.936
I will read your script
and I will call you,

22:36.961 --> 22:39.542
but you're just going
to need to be patient.

22:44.976 --> 22:48.351
So, Sophie Marchuk's still missing.

22:48.419 --> 22:50.186
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:50.255 --> 22:52.955
When was the last time you saw her?

22:53.024 --> 22:54.531
After the holidays.

22:54.556 --> 22:56.735
I told you that last time
you were here, Detective.

22:56.828 --> 23:00.296
Yes, I appreciate your consistency.

23:00.365 --> 23:01.898
A new question.

23:01.966 --> 23:04.867
Does the name Jared Hall
mean anything to you?

23:04.936 --> 23:06.802
Or Anthony Nguyen?

23:06.871 --> 23:07.970
No.

23:08.039 --> 23:10.014
You see, the L.A.P.D.

23:10.039 --> 23:12.708
has missing persons
reports on both of them.

23:12.777 --> 23:16.112
Now, there's a lot of sick
and weird people in L.A.,

23:16.156 --> 23:19.782
and law of percentages says that
some of them are gonna disappear.

23:19.807 --> 23:21.374
But the thing is,

23:21.419 --> 23:25.242
both Hall and Nquyen took
courses at your institute.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.124
Detective, thousands of people

23:28.192 --> 23:29.759
come to the Institute every year.

23:29.827 --> 23:33.312
And three of them have
disappeared in the last two.

23:33.375 --> 23:36.232
People come to us for
help, which presupposes

23:36.301 --> 23:38.534
there are going to be
some emotional problems.

23:38.603 --> 23:40.436
Of course.

23:40.505 --> 23:43.288
But you do help some of them, don't you?

23:44.476 --> 23:47.009
Like Kyle West.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.343
It's late. I want to go home.

23:52.150 --> 23:53.716
Sure.

23:53.785 --> 23:55.751
Yeah, home is nice.

24:00.058 --> 24:01.624
I know you're probably gonna call

24:01.693 --> 24:03.526
one of your bigwig
friends in the department,

24:03.595 --> 24:05.795
but I've been doing this
a long time, Mr. Anderson.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.810
I have friends too.

24:15.635 --> 24:18.244
He was a potential
superstar, with no work-ethic.

24:19.472 --> 24:22.052
I taught him how to
study, and he got an A.

24:22.077 --> 24:23.143
Ho, ho.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.812
And that is when I knew.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.726
And look at you now, baby.

24:27.850 --> 24:29.783
I am.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.921
So I read that you
two met at an audition.

24:33.989 --> 24:35.422
Is that a real story?

24:35.491 --> 24:37.391
- That is a real story.
- Yeah.

24:37.459 --> 24:38.770
So you liked each other's acting?

24:38.794 --> 24:40.360
They had chemistry.

24:40.429 --> 24:42.529
Major chemistry.

24:42.598 --> 24:45.632
Megan was amazing, so
I asked her to lunch.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.534
And then he asked me to Mexico.

24:47.603 --> 24:49.893
Wow. You got a job and a boyfriend.

24:49.918 --> 24:52.456
Now, that's a good audition, girl.

24:52.481 --> 24:54.308
Just the boyfriend.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.020
But still a good audition.

24:58.071 --> 24:59.938
Why didn't she get the part?

25:01.283 --> 25:04.345
Business stuff, you
know. It's complicated.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.424
We're gonna work on
something else together.

25:07.656 --> 25:09.256
Come on, tell the truth.

25:09.325 --> 25:10.802
Was there really a movie, or were you

25:10.826 --> 25:11.949
just auditioning her
to be your girlfriend?

25:11.973 --> 25:13.938
Claudia, stop trippin'.

25:13.963 --> 25:15.996
Come on, you don't
think that happens?

25:16.065 --> 25:19.237
Maybe that's what they do at
the Institute of the Higher Mind.

25:20.331 --> 25:23.237
I'm sorry, but you're my favorite actor,

25:23.305 --> 25:26.095
and you're my favorite
athlete, and this is insane.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.586
Can I please get a
picture with you guys?

25:27.610 --> 25:30.444
Here's the thing,
um, if we do that for you,

25:30.512 --> 25:32.157
we're gonna have to do
that for everybody in here,

25:32.181 --> 25:34.581
so if you give your name
and address to the hostess,

25:34.650 --> 25:37.284
he and I will send you
some autographed photos.

25:37.353 --> 25:38.919
How about that?

25:39.252 --> 25:41.188
Hey. Hey, partner, you know what?

25:41.257 --> 25:42.422
I'll take a photo with you.

25:42.491 --> 25:43.957
We're leaving soon anyway, right?

25:44.009 --> 25:46.543
We are right over here. Here you go.

25:46.568 --> 25:49.540
Come on. Where ya at
now? All right, okay.

25:49.565 --> 25:51.642
- What's up, fellas?
- Better go do my job.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.200
Hey, Brandon!

25:53.225 --> 25:54.621
How you doin'?

26:04.414 --> 26:06.713
So her theory about
the audition is crazy.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.217
I know.

26:10.286 --> 26:11.696
But now I get why Brandon won't commit

26:11.720 --> 26:13.620
to the program you want to do with him.

26:13.689 --> 26:16.023
Claudia's not down with IHM.

26:16.091 --> 26:19.026
- And she calls the shots.
- Ha ha!

26:19.094 --> 26:21.361
If you want Brandon,

26:21.430 --> 26:23.830
you're gonna have to
give her what she wants.

26:25.741 --> 26:27.920
- Whoo!
- What does she want?

26:28.904 --> 26:30.871
She wants her moment.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.941
I have an idea.

26:34.009 --> 26:37.566
Attention is his addiction.
He could do this all night.

26:37.591 --> 26:39.980
Hey, do you like karaoke?

26:40.049 --> 26:41.988
My God, I love karaoke.

26:42.013 --> 26:44.777
- Yeah?
- And I'm really good at it too.

26:50.592 --> 26:53.106
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

26:53.142 --> 26:56.110
How's Sophie Marchuk
progressing at the facility?

26:58.599 --> 27:01.500
As of last week, right on schedule.

27:02.805 --> 27:04.082
Let me know if anything changes.

27:04.106 --> 27:05.672
We need to get her back into the world

27:05.741 --> 27:07.624
- before things get messy.
- Okay.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.845
We got meditation rooms just down here.

27:11.914 --> 27:13.680
There's a little courtyard here.

27:13.749 --> 27:16.049
Our evening workshops
are always very popular.

27:16.118 --> 27:18.218
There's a definite social
aspect to what we do here.

27:18.287 --> 27:20.249
- Wow.
- Hello.

27:20.522 --> 27:21.788
Terence.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.576
This is Shaun.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.351
Megan's friend.

27:25.376 --> 27:26.684
What... what brings you here?

27:26.729 --> 27:30.998
Well, I asked James to
give me the 25-cent tour,

27:31.066 --> 27:33.633
so here we are.

27:33.702 --> 27:36.103
She is very special.

27:36.171 --> 27:38.538
I think she'd really take
to the work we do here.

27:38.607 --> 27:40.561
I'm sure she would.

27:41.443 --> 27:43.710
Don't you have a workshop
to teach in the morning?

27:45.414 --> 27:46.772
Yeah.

27:47.683 --> 27:51.151
Why don't you get some rest,
and I'll give Shaun the tour?

27:53.956 --> 27:55.389
That's okay. I don't...

27:55.457 --> 27:57.858
I don't want to put either of you out.

27:59.561 --> 28:02.863
No, no. No, it's...
it's better with Terence.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.365
Trust me, it's good.
I'll... I'll see you later.

28:13.375 --> 28:14.674
Shall we?

28:21.178 --> 28:22.577
You know, people always saying

28:22.602 --> 28:24.317
you got your job and you got your girl.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.651
Shit. You got your job,

28:26.676 --> 28:28.221
and then your girl is your other job.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.824
You gotta work every day.

28:33.162 --> 28:35.462
So Daisy's talking to me
about buying the rights

28:35.531 --> 28:37.198
to my life story.

28:37.223 --> 28:38.757
That's what that's called, right?

28:38.782 --> 28:40.400
How much do you think that's worth?

28:40.469 --> 28:41.902
Um, I don't know.

28:47.938 --> 28:50.710
You gotta punch in, work every day.

28:53.515 --> 28:54.515
Yeah.

28:55.893 --> 28:57.041
Yeah.

29:04.226 --> 29:05.392
So you gonna sing?

29:05.461 --> 29:07.127
It's not really my thing.

29:07.196 --> 29:09.430
You're just too good for karaoke?

29:09.485 --> 29:12.055
And autographs and
pictures with your fans?

29:14.236 --> 29:16.521
I'm not too good for karaoke.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.148
Hello, hello, hello. What's going on?

29:30.396 --> 29:32.145
All right.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.442
Well, I'm gonna need two things

29:33.467 --> 29:35.222
before I sing the shit out of this song.

29:35.290 --> 29:37.390
First off, sorry, guys,
gotta put the phones away.

29:37.459 --> 29:40.393
Sorry, guys, put the phones away.

29:40.462 --> 29:42.963
I'm sorry, that's the only
way this is gonna happen.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.398
All right, thing number two.

29:45.467 --> 29:48.001
I need Megan Morrison to
come sing this song with me.

29:48.070 --> 29:49.836
Come on, guys, help me out.

29:49.905 --> 29:51.505
- Go! Megan, go!
- Let's get her up here.

29:52.841 --> 29:54.508
Guys, let's go. Come on.

29:54.576 --> 29:55.809
There we go.

29:57.646 --> 29:59.212
Megan!

30:01.397 --> 30:03.950
- Very tricky.
- There you go.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.434
- You know this one?
- You bet I do.

30:06.459 --> 30:08.588
Better keep up, boys.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.239
Gotta put that phone away, baby doll.

30:26.308 --> 30:28.241
Only if I get an autograph.

30:28.310 --> 30:30.777
Well, I just happen to have a pen.

31:32.441 --> 31:34.441
I saw you signing that girl's ass.

31:34.509 --> 31:36.009
Did you like that?

31:36.078 --> 31:37.611
All right, CC.

31:37.679 --> 31:40.098
- You chill, all right?
- Answer the question.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.653
Yeah.

31:42.678 --> 31:44.351
Yeah, you know, I liked it.

31:44.419 --> 31:45.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:47.055 --> 31:49.189
You like it as much as mine?

31:49.258 --> 31:51.124
Well, I don't know.

31:51.193 --> 31:53.226
Why don't you show me
so I can compare?

31:53.295 --> 31:54.485
You think you can handle this ass?

31:54.509 --> 31:56.562
Baby, I know you
ain't challenging me,

31:56.587 --> 31:58.098
because I will wreck that ass.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.428
We should have taken an Uber.

32:01.661 --> 32:03.367
- What you got there?
- Hey, now, come on.

32:03.392 --> 32:04.904
This is a family car, all right?

32:04.973 --> 32:06.640
All right, all right.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.608
I know you want to see
more, but you gotta wait.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.070
- Aw, baby, come on, now.
- No.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.876
Why don't you just hike it up?
Just hike it up just a little bit.

32:11.900 --> 32:12.968
Don't be shy.

32:12.993 --> 32:14.225
- Come on, guys.
- You gonna have to bring it.

32:14.249 --> 32:15.415
Just drive, please.

32:15.484 --> 32:17.217
Bring it.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.060
You know you want some of that.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.422
What you got for me?

32:22.491 --> 32:24.090
Come on, don't be shy.

32:26.762 --> 32:28.435
Watch out!

32:38.632 --> 32:40.296
Look, baby, just say you were driving.

32:40.328 --> 32:41.594
The League will suspend me.

32:41.663 --> 32:43.529
I am not taking the blame for this!

32:43.554 --> 32:44.882
Are you kidding me?

32:44.907 --> 32:46.666
- How could you even say that?
- Whoa, whoa, come on.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.190
How could you even say that to me?

32:48.259 --> 32:49.536
- Relax, all right?
- Are you kidding me?

32:49.560 --> 32:51.527
Hey! Are you okay, sir?

32:51.595 --> 32:52.928
Can you hear me?

32:52.997 --> 32:54.197
We gotta get him out of there.

32:54.231 --> 32:55.397
Brandon!

32:55.466 --> 32:56.944
Brandon!

32:57.401 --> 32:58.867
Give me a hand. Watch his head.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.702
Let's get away from the truck.

33:00.771 --> 33:01.837
He's unconscious.

33:01.906 --> 33:02.906
Baby, calm down.

33:02.973 --> 33:04.573
Calm down, calm down.

33:04.642 --> 33:05.941
All right, gentle.

33:06.010 --> 33:07.709
Watch his head.

33:07.778 --> 33:10.241
I-I don't wanna hurt him.

33:12.683 --> 33:14.469
This is 911. What's your emergency?

33:14.494 --> 33:15.584
Hello?

33:15.653 --> 33:18.120
It's an impressive place,

33:18.189 --> 33:20.756
but I'm sure you hear that all the time.

33:20.825 --> 33:23.725
Just wanted to make sure
you got a complete picture.

33:23.794 --> 33:27.210
And make sure I'm not here
on a fact-finding mission?

33:27.235 --> 33:29.935
Do you think there
are facts to be found?

33:31.168 --> 33:34.236
I signed an NDA when I
looked over Megan's contract.

33:34.305 --> 33:36.772
There are obviously facts to be found.

33:36.841 --> 33:38.640
But that's not why I'm here.

33:38.693 --> 33:40.852
Right, you're wondering if
you're actually interested in IHM

33:40.876 --> 33:43.782
or if this is just about
the guy you're sleeping with.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.216
You're very direct...

33:47.284 --> 33:49.040
and perceptive.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.890
Well, that's why I sent James home.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.004
I wanted you to see IHM with clear eyes

33:54.058 --> 33:55.824
and then see that this is a place where,

33:55.893 --> 33:59.661
if you are open to new ideas,
your potential has no limits.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.079
I like to think I'm open to anything.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.474
To be continued.

34:21.902 --> 34:24.152
He's not drunk, and it wasn't his fault.

34:24.221 --> 34:26.188
The other car swerved
right into his lane.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.156
It's your right to
refuse the sobriety test,

34:28.225 --> 34:29.436
but we need to take
you down to the station

34:29.460 --> 34:30.926
- to test your...
- Nah, no.

34:30.995 --> 34:32.527
No, wait, man. No, hell, no, see,

34:32.596 --> 34:34.228
I ain't going anywhere with you, man.

34:34.297 --> 34:35.442
Well, it's not up to you, superstar.

34:35.466 --> 34:36.926
- Hey, don't touch him!
- Get off me, man!

34:36.949 --> 34:38.300
Brandon, chill!

34:38.324 --> 34:39.965
- Get your hands off me, now!
- Calm down.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.844
You need to calm down.

34:42.929 --> 34:45.292
This is gonna be a long night for you.

34:45.947 --> 34:47.001
Officer.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.455
- Officer!
- What?!

34:48.480 --> 34:50.697
I have Captain Davis
on the phone for you.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.650
Officer John.

34:58.004 --> 34:59.404
Yes, sir.

35:00.357 --> 35:02.026
Yes, sir.

35:05.029 --> 35:06.925
You're free to go.

35:07.283 --> 35:09.408
Ha ha! Yeah, that's right!

35:09.433 --> 35:11.433
Brandon, that's enough!

35:40.898 --> 35:42.440
Thanks.

35:48.072 --> 35:50.193
You were good tonight.

35:51.442 --> 35:52.756
You too.

36:07.091 --> 36:09.358
Well, it helped us keep
everything in perspective.

36:09.426 --> 36:11.734
This is gonna be problematic.

36:12.363 --> 36:14.242
What's problematic?

36:15.695 --> 36:18.133
I just saw this.

36:18.202 --> 36:19.586
What?

36:23.680 --> 36:25.741
"West and Drake were in the same car

36:25.809 --> 36:28.143
"when they happened
upon a burning vehicle

36:28.212 --> 36:30.979
"and heroically pulled
the victim to safety"?

36:31.048 --> 36:33.181
Are you kidding me? We saved that guy.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.061
Brandon was yelling at
his wife the whole time.

36:35.085 --> 36:37.919
I know. It's a spin job.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.755
See, we weren't thinking about the risk.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.722
We just... we just acted.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.125
You see, our training at the Institute,

36:44.150 --> 36:46.484
well, it helped us keep
everything in perspective.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.964
When did they shoot this, after we left?

36:49.033 --> 36:50.766
I guess so.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.501
This is all a lie.

36:52.526 --> 36:55.227
Terence gets Brandon out of a DUI,

36:55.339 --> 36:57.172
then has him spin some bullshit story

36:57.197 --> 36:58.429
about being a hero,

36:58.454 --> 37:00.512
and now he has to commit
to the Institute, right?

37:00.537 --> 37:02.544
That's what will happen, yes.

37:02.613 --> 37:05.082
Meanwhile, the legend
of Kyle West lives on.

37:10.387 --> 37:12.521
You make things look one way,

37:12.589 --> 37:14.423
and then Terence snaps his fingers,

37:14.491 --> 37:16.758
and you become a different person.

37:16.827 --> 37:18.994
It's not normal.

37:19.063 --> 37:21.163
I'm supposed to be in
love with you, and...

37:21.231 --> 37:24.199
I don't know who you really are.

37:24.224 --> 37:26.732
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

37:28.072 --> 37:29.568
Well...

37:31.642 --> 37:34.324
who were you before
Terence got ahold of you?

37:34.349 --> 37:35.745
You don't want to know.

37:35.813 --> 37:38.980
Kyle, I have to know,

37:39.049 --> 37:41.283
or we are never going to work.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.434
Wait, Kyle.

37:59.856 --> 38:01.551
What do you see?

38:05.770 --> 38:08.149
A beautiful little boy.

38:08.519 --> 38:11.415
I see a boy whose uncle told
him that if he didn't smile,

38:11.440 --> 38:13.305
he's gonna kick the crap out of.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.305
Look, I wasn't worth knowing...

38:26.797 --> 38:28.766
when I met Terence.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.400
He saved my life.

38:32.469 --> 38:35.047
And he taught me how to change it.

38:36.006 --> 38:38.985
It's not perfect and it is...

38:39.476 --> 38:41.852
nowhere even close to normal,

38:42.279 --> 38:44.212
but...

38:44.281 --> 38:47.215
but everything I have
that's good in my life,

38:47.284 --> 38:49.050
I have because of Terence.

38:50.677 --> 38:52.143
Including you.

38:54.521 --> 38:57.685
Look, I want to be the
man you need me to be.

39:01.064 --> 39:03.191
It's just gonna take some time.

39:18.575 --> 39:21.152
We're gonna start with the
glycerin drops this time, okay?

39:21.177 --> 39:23.111
No, Andres, we're not doing that.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.746
Kyle, I don't want to waste time.

39:24.815 --> 39:26.199
I can work up some tears.

39:26.224 --> 39:28.512
Forget the goddamn tears!

39:29.040 --> 39:32.207
You can't just fake your way
through the whole damn thing!

39:32.662 --> 39:35.504
Kyle, just, take it easy, okay?

39:46.837 --> 39:48.803
Stop acting.

39:49.659 --> 39:52.147
You're no good at it anyway.

39:53.570 --> 39:55.247
Just...

39:56.954 --> 39:59.354
be yourself,

39:59.379 --> 40:02.561
if you even have any
idea what that means.

40:10.627 --> 40:12.164
Shoot the scene.

40:14.765 --> 40:16.832
All right, is everybody
ready on the set?

40:16.900 --> 40:19.568
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

40:21.124 --> 40:24.546
What a day. Still can't find her?

40:24.843 --> 40:26.475
Tomorrow we've got how...

40:26.543 --> 40:27.640
- Hi.
- If we get...

40:27.665 --> 40:29.960
We're done for the day.
We went through the list, yeah?

40:29.985 --> 40:32.812
I'm not on the list,
but I'd like to read.

40:32.837 --> 40:34.484
My name's Megan Morrison.

40:34.953 --> 40:37.386
I told your agent I
didn't want to read you.

40:37.454 --> 40:39.109
I was pretty clear about that.

40:39.134 --> 40:41.570
I know, because I-I represent

40:41.595 --> 40:45.330
all of the fake Hollywood
bullshit that you hate, but...

40:45.550 --> 40:47.227
that's not me.

40:47.252 --> 40:48.575
I'm an actor.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.695
I've always loved the
theater, and I love your play.

40:51.810 --> 40:55.132
Every actor who walks in here
tells me they love my play.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.609
And have you found your Kate yet?

41:00.151 --> 41:03.196
Then stop being an
asshole and let me read.

41:07.596 --> 41:09.033
I'm glad you came.

41:09.058 --> 41:10.624
I almost didn't.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.502
Late night marriage
session is not exactly

41:12.527 --> 41:14.182
the fix I had in mind.

41:14.207 --> 41:16.690
Yeah, well, it's not gonna
be that kind of session.

41:16.715 --> 41:18.315
Really?

41:18.340 --> 41:20.401
I found someone for us,
someone new to the Institute.

41:20.425 --> 41:21.971
I think you're gonna like her.

41:28.057 --> 41:29.971
Deann, this is Annika.

41:43.694 --> 41:46.310
I'm not so good at being patient.
