(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:07.079 --> 00:09.879
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:09.879 --> 00:12.250
(The scenes with dead bodies and animals were staged and fictitious.)

00:12.250 --> 00:14.889
(This drama may contain disturbing and brutal scenes.)

00:53.396 --> 00:54.997
The crime site and his residence...

00:54.997 --> 00:57.067
may be within the walking distance...

00:57.067 --> 00:59.336
between the point she went missing to the victim's home.

01:15.956 --> 01:17.186
I think I found the place.

01:18.727 --> 01:19.787
Wait for me.

01:25.373 --> 01:27.912
(Item Storage)

02:19.086 --> 02:20.116
Cho Hyun Gil!

02:38.866 --> 02:41.407
If you search his house, it will be neatly organized.

02:41.836 --> 02:45.046
The weapon he used will also be put away neatly.

02:53.486 --> 02:56.056
That's not a shelf, it's the interior floor of the fridge.

03:33.187 --> 03:35.556
Captain Yoon. What...

03:36.996 --> 03:38.026
Captain Yoon.

04:06.492 --> 04:11.293
(Through the Darkness, Episode 4)

04:14.567 --> 04:16.966
It's caked with dust. I doubt he'll come back.

04:17.435 --> 04:19.366
A man who lives alone doesn't clean.

04:19.366 --> 04:21.207
But seeing how organized and neat he was,

04:21.207 --> 04:23.407
he probably spends a lot of time cleaning too.

04:23.746 --> 04:26.077
Seeing how dusty it is like Captain Kook said,

04:26.277 --> 04:28.077
he didn't come here for a long time.

04:28.077 --> 04:29.147
But...

04:30.886 --> 04:32.246
we'll still wait for him.

04:32.246 --> 04:33.717
I'll wait too.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.157
You don't have to.

04:35.386 --> 04:37.886
- Detective Nam and I can handle it. - Right.

04:38.986 --> 04:41.457
Then I'll get going first.

04:42.527 --> 04:44.397
Goodnight. Goodnight to you.

04:44.397 --> 04:45.426
Bye.

04:46.626 --> 04:47.636
You should go home too.

04:47.636 --> 04:49.667
I don't want there to be a pile of cars here.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.407
I'll park my car somewhere else.

04:52.636 --> 04:53.636
What?

04:55.176 --> 04:57.446
He never listens to others.

04:57.847 --> 04:58.847
He doesn't.

04:59.806 --> 05:00.977
Good luck.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.616
If anything happens, give me a call right away.

05:20.897 --> 05:23.236
Get some sleep if you're tired.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.667
No. I'm fine.

05:26.136 --> 05:28.207
If you're tired, you can get some sleep.

05:29.837 --> 05:32.847
No. I'm good too.

05:41.116 --> 05:42.217
Should I get off?

05:42.756 --> 05:43.857
Wait.

05:53.027 --> 05:54.066
Gosh.

05:55.537 --> 05:57.267
That scared the wits out of me.

06:34.037 --> 06:36.436
You carry around cat food?

06:36.907 --> 06:38.207
Yes. Sometimes.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.977
It's not cat food. It's just some snacks.

06:43.046 --> 06:44.917
What are you eating?

06:45.847 --> 06:47.217
Chocolates.

06:53.926 --> 06:55.397
I'm good.

06:59.366 --> 07:00.897
I didn't peg you...

07:02.196 --> 07:03.866
to be an animal lover.

07:04.837 --> 07:06.566
Animals can't talk,

07:08.006 --> 07:09.236
so they can't lie.

07:11.246 --> 07:12.707
Even when they're hungry...

07:13.746 --> 07:15.417
or sick, they can't tell us.

07:17.587 --> 07:18.686
So I just thought...

07:19.986 --> 07:21.787
it'd be nice...

07:24.587 --> 07:25.787
if someone recognized it first.

08:06.597 --> 08:09.537
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

08:09.796 --> 08:10.967
Oh, hello.

08:12.907 --> 08:16.376
We're just waiting for someone.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.246
Are you waiting for Cho?

08:23.446 --> 08:24.886
Well, yes.

08:26.186 --> 08:27.686
Do you know Mr. Cho Hyun Gil?

08:28.486 --> 08:30.926
I'm his landlady.

08:31.527 --> 08:35.057
Do you happen to know when he'll be back?

08:35.057 --> 08:38.197
I actually came here to check because I couldn't reach him.

08:38.765 --> 08:40.126
He's behind on rent,

08:40.126 --> 08:42.437
but I can't get hold of him.

08:42.597 --> 08:43.635
Well, anyway...

08:44.107 --> 08:47.876
Why are you looking for him so early in the morning?

08:49.607 --> 08:50.807
We're from the police.

08:54.717 --> 08:55.817
(Scientific Investigations Team)

08:57.746 --> 08:59.947
(Forensics)

09:10.927 --> 09:11.996
- You're here. - Hey.

09:13.067 --> 09:15.837
The description of the little girl the landlady saw...

09:15.837 --> 09:17.197
matches that of Soo Hyun.

09:17.197 --> 09:19.067
- Did you check the vehicle too? - Yes.

09:19.337 --> 09:21.337
Gosh. Now, we just need to find Cho Hyun Gil.

09:21.337 --> 09:22.406
Sir, you're here.

09:22.807 --> 09:25.707
Hey, what are you doing here?

09:26.307 --> 09:27.347
Darn it.

09:27.347 --> 09:30.016
Hey, the Behavioral Analysis Team can't be here.

09:30.016 --> 09:31.616
- Why not? - You know the answer.

09:31.616 --> 09:33.916
You can investigate, but it must be done under the table.

09:34.016 --> 09:35.616
If the higher-ups find out, they'll go bonkers.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.187
If the media finds out, it'll be even worse.

09:37.187 --> 09:39.087
This is so unfair.

09:39.087 --> 09:40.256
Why is it unfair?

09:40.256 --> 09:41.996
Don't you know that the commissioner...

09:41.996 --> 09:43.697
is more afraid of the reporters than his wife?

09:44.266 --> 09:45.666
What? You're here too?

09:45.666 --> 09:48.097
I'm sure we'll find Soo Hyun's fingers around his house.

09:48.866 --> 09:50.396
We must find them.

09:50.766 --> 09:53.567
First, you'll have to help us search the scene.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.607
Gosh.

09:55.477 --> 09:59.547
- Check that spot over there. - This spot here?

10:00.506 --> 10:02.847
Careful. Be careful not to touch that.

10:03.146 --> 10:04.687
Check that spot in the back too.

10:04.947 --> 10:06.016
Anything?

10:07.286 --> 10:09.357
Did you find anything? Look, over there.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.727
Over here!

10:17.666 --> 10:18.727
What is it?

10:22.967 --> 10:25.136
It has decomposed, but it is a finger of a child.

10:30.036 --> 10:31.307
Let's keep on searching.

10:47.327 --> 10:48.896
There are only eight fingers.

10:50.526 --> 10:51.697
Let's keep looking.

10:52.396 --> 10:54.136
I'm sure we'll find the rest.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.236
They may have drifted away.

10:56.666 --> 11:00.006
Let's search together all the way to the nearest sewer.

11:00.337 --> 11:02.906
Let's keep on looking. We'll search together.

11:13.246 --> 11:16.016
We're missing two fingers of a girl!

11:16.256 --> 11:20.286
Look through the grass and check under the rocks. Search thoroughly!

11:20.587 --> 11:21.697
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

11:37.807 --> 11:38.807
Young Soo.

11:40.107 --> 11:41.116
Yes.

11:41.116 --> 11:43.047
We searched thoroughly all the way there...

11:43.047 --> 11:44.047
but found nothing.

11:45.886 --> 11:47.516
This is the last spot where we can search.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.486
They must've rotten away by now.

11:49.486 --> 11:51.986
The body was stored in the freezer...

11:51.986 --> 11:53.727
before it was discarded at different times.

11:53.727 --> 11:55.526
It'll help us determine the degree of decomposition.

11:56.957 --> 11:58.396
We must find them, even just the bones.

11:58.396 --> 12:00.697
We still have hope, so let's keep on looking.

12:01.097 --> 12:02.597
Let's search some more.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.337
Yes, sir.

12:10.977 --> 12:12.146
Captain.

12:12.876 --> 12:13.977
Did you find something?

12:20.646 --> 12:22.957
Darn it. It's a sausage.

13:17.409 --> 13:20.610
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

13:20.947 --> 13:23.217
We checked the area where Cho Hyun Gil's home is located...

13:23.217 --> 13:25.386
immediately after the incident broke out.

13:26.187 --> 13:27.246
Right.

13:27.246 --> 13:29.687
It didn't look like anyone lived there,

13:31.656 --> 13:32.957
so we let it slip under the radar.

13:32.957 --> 13:36.057
No, it's totally understandable.

13:36.057 --> 13:38.297
Gosh, I couldn't even figure out where the entrance was.

13:38.297 --> 13:39.927
I couldn't even find the door.

13:40.327 --> 13:42.266
Why is it so hot in here? Am I the only one sweating?

13:43.837 --> 13:45.937
Here, use this as a fan.

13:48.276 --> 13:50.107
- Thanks. - Soo Hyun's fingers...

13:51.107 --> 13:52.307
We'll find them.

13:54.646 --> 13:55.947
We already found eight of them.

13:56.146 --> 13:59.447
They were thrown out, so I'm sure we'll find the rest.

14:00.786 --> 14:01.817
Yes, we must find them.

14:03.286 --> 14:04.756
By the way, how did you know?

14:05.957 --> 14:07.697
That her fingers would be there.

14:07.927 --> 14:08.996
It was just...

14:11.227 --> 14:12.227
a gut feeling.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.967
You're as intuitive as Captain Yoon.

14:15.236 --> 14:16.996
Why don't we call it a day?

14:16.996 --> 14:18.636
Yes, let's do that.

14:18.636 --> 14:21.906
You can all get going. I'll leave in a bit.

14:21.906 --> 14:23.307
It was a long day.

14:23.307 --> 14:24.776
Tomorrow will be another hard day. Get some rest.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.077
I'm okay. You should all get going.

14:27.077 --> 14:28.177
- All right. - Bye.

14:28.177 --> 14:30.016
- Bye. - Bye.

14:31.116 --> 14:32.986
Then I'll get going too.

14:32.986 --> 14:34.486
Okay, good work today.

14:34.886 --> 14:36.016
Take it easy.

14:44.396 --> 14:45.427
Ha Young.

14:46.597 --> 14:48.337
If you insist on staying late all by yourself,

14:49.067 --> 14:52.837
everyone else will feel like they're not working hard enough.

14:54.266 --> 14:56.477
My apologies. That wasn't my intention.

14:56.477 --> 14:57.847
Don't overwork yourself.

14:57.847 --> 14:59.707
- I won't. Have a good night. - You too.

15:00.847 --> 15:02.047
- See you. - Bye.

15:14.256 --> 15:17.327
My gosh. I'm sorry, honey.

15:17.927 --> 15:19.297
I woke you up, didn't I?

15:19.597 --> 15:20.896
Are the kids asleep?

15:21.896 --> 15:24.707
I see, okay.

15:25.236 --> 15:28.607
You know, tell Joo Hyun and Soo Hyun...

15:33.646 --> 15:35.477
that I want to hear their voices.

15:36.317 --> 15:38.587
Have them call me when they wake up. These brats.

15:40.286 --> 15:43.087
Oh, boy. I'm being selfish again.

15:43.087 --> 15:44.727
I woke you up.

15:46.187 --> 15:47.457
I'm sorry.

15:48.396 --> 15:50.026
Go back to sleep, Mi Yeon.

15:51.126 --> 15:52.467
I love you.

15:53.427 --> 15:54.437
Okay.

16:33.366 --> 16:35.006
Kidnapped on May 20.

16:35.677 --> 16:38.376
Body parts were found for the 1st time on May 29.

16:38.947 --> 16:41.817
The torso and the head were also found on May 30.

16:42.477 --> 16:45.447
On June 25, additional body parts were found in a toilet at an inn...

16:45.447 --> 16:47.217
after the culprit spent a night there.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.457
Cho Hyun Gil disposed of the body parts...

16:49.457 --> 16:51.827
in different places on different days.

16:52.857 --> 16:55.297
The two fingers that haven't turned up yet.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.227
Where could they be?

16:58.366 --> 17:01.396
Where could Cho Hyun Gil be hiding?

17:02.337 --> 17:04.435
Where could Cho Hyun Gil be hiding?

17:16.234 --> 17:18.087
(44 days after the incident)

17:18.087 --> 17:20.886
(July 12, 2000)

17:20.886 --> 17:22.455
(Forensics Squad)

17:22.455 --> 17:23.517
(Every contact leaves a trace.)

17:23.517 --> 17:24.787
- You're here. - Good work.

17:25.327 --> 17:26.386
Where's In Tak?

17:26.386 --> 17:27.955
He went to take a nap.

17:27.955 --> 17:31.027
- May I see the analysis result? - Yes, one second.

17:32.027 --> 17:33.067
Right here.

17:35.819 --> 17:37.089
(Please keep the door closed.)

17:38.767 --> 17:40.136
- Oh my. - You're here.

17:40.507 --> 17:41.936
You haven't slept.

17:42.376 --> 17:44.507
I lied down to take a nap,

17:44.507 --> 17:46.607
but I kept having dreams of looking for the kid's fingers,

17:46.607 --> 17:47.946
so I just got up.

17:48.176 --> 17:49.277
You're doing good work.

17:49.517 --> 17:52.287
We compared the fingerprints we got yesterday from his house,

17:52.287 --> 17:55.057
and they're mostly of Cho Hyun Gil or that child victim.

17:55.787 --> 17:57.587
Have you heard about the DNAs too?

17:57.587 --> 17:59.787
Yes, the NFS called.

18:00.126 --> 18:02.257
I don't see his middle and ring fingers here either.

18:02.597 --> 18:05.267
So you only found fingerprints for three fingers on the weapon?

18:05.267 --> 18:07.696
The fingerprints we found at his place are all partial.

18:07.726 --> 18:09.936
All we have are five fingers.

18:09.966 --> 18:12.366
For now, we know that it was done by Cho Hyun Gil.

18:12.366 --> 18:15.077
We just have to find out where he's hiding.

18:15.077 --> 18:17.007
We found out who he is, so he'll be caught soon.

18:17.307 --> 18:18.976
- Anyway, keep it up. - Okay.

18:18.976 --> 18:21.277
- Let me know if you find anything. - All right.

18:21.277 --> 18:22.747
- Take care. - Goodbye.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.747
Cho Hyun Gil. Age 40.

18:28.017 --> 18:31.327
He lived in 39-1 Changeui-dong.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.386
In September of 1997,

18:33.527 --> 18:36.426
He has a history of molesting a four-year-old girl in Songju-dong.

18:36.426 --> 18:40.466
So how did he get omitted from the list?

18:40.466 --> 18:43.337
After he moved, he did not register his new address.

18:43.337 --> 18:45.567
That's why he was left out.

18:46.337 --> 18:47.936
I went to his house,

18:47.936 --> 18:51.347
and it could hardly be called a home where one lives.

18:51.946 --> 18:56.047
His house was in a corner, so we missed it when we went around.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.616
- I'm sorry. - We missed him right before us.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.557
Hey, wait.

19:02.287 --> 19:04.926
If he was previously convicted in 1997,

19:05.357 --> 19:06.726
it hasn't been that long.

19:06.726 --> 19:09.757
He was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.626
He was released this March.

19:11.626 --> 19:15.136
Goodness, that means it has only been four months.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.837
The ink on the paperwork probably didn't even dry, that jerk.

19:17.837 --> 19:21.706
Anyway, we found the DNA of the missing kid in his house?

19:21.777 --> 19:24.237
The NFS just called.

19:24.237 --> 19:27.577
We also confirmed his fingerprints all over the weapon.

19:27.577 --> 19:31.277
Make sure you find where this Cho Hyun Gil is.

19:31.277 --> 19:33.987
If he did this only two months after his release,

19:33.987 --> 19:35.716
we don't know what he'll do next.

19:35.956 --> 19:38.057
Captain Yoon, let's hurry.

19:38.057 --> 19:41.087
The entire team went out to search around Changeui-dong area.

19:41.726 --> 19:45.567
I sent Detective Nam out to the butcher shop Cho worked at.

19:46.297 --> 19:48.737
He must've worked here while Moon Soo was here.

19:48.866 --> 19:51.636
- Moon Soo? - He's my nephew.

19:51.936 --> 19:53.866
I had to go out for some business,

19:54.537 --> 19:56.537
so my nephew was looking after my shop.

19:56.537 --> 19:57.876
Oh, I see.

19:57.876 --> 20:02.017
That man suddenly quit even before a month was up.

20:02.277 --> 20:05.317
Most people won't pay the man after leaving like that.

20:05.517 --> 20:07.517
I'm a good man, so I paid him what he deserves.

20:07.517 --> 20:09.456
Do you have anything to show that you paid him?

20:09.456 --> 20:11.587
You know, on your bank account history.

20:11.587 --> 20:16.226
People who take up jobs like that do it for the cash.

20:16.497 --> 20:17.997
You paid him fully in cash?

20:18.226 --> 20:21.097
Right, I gave him some checks too.

20:21.636 --> 20:25.436
Yes, do you remember which bank it was?

20:25.906 --> 20:27.936
Was it Johong Bank?

20:28.107 --> 20:30.107
May I see the transaction history of this check?

20:30.107 --> 20:31.136
(Johong Bank)

20:31.136 --> 20:33.706
I guess we came for a search when his nephew was at the shop.

20:33.777 --> 20:34.916
That's why we missed him.

20:36.517 --> 20:39.287
I'll send you the address of where the check was used.

20:46.357 --> 20:48.956
- Prints from only three fingers? - Yes.

20:49.626 --> 20:51.626
When you grab a knife or a saw,

20:51.626 --> 20:53.597
your fingerprints are printed at a certain location.

20:54.696 --> 20:55.696
Like this.

20:55.737 --> 20:58.807
I'd get it if we didn't find any fingerprints at all.

20:58.807 --> 21:02.476
You'll see even partial prints from the middle and ring fingers.

21:02.476 --> 21:05.247
Right thumb, right index, and right pinky.

21:05.277 --> 21:07.077
Isn't it weird that we only found those three?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.176
It's either one of the two.

21:11.946 --> 21:14.146
He either has an odd habit when he grabs things,

21:17.916 --> 21:19.257
or he's missing those two fingers.

21:28.866 --> 21:30.936
I'm going to make you fly.

21:31.297 --> 21:32.466
Here we go.

21:32.936 --> 21:34.166
Just push me.

21:35.906 --> 21:37.676
Don't do it so hard.

21:39.577 --> 21:41.777
What are you doing? Come on!

21:51.133 --> 21:53.534
By any chance, have you seen this man?

21:54.426 --> 21:56.656
(Dairy Products)

21:59.319 --> 22:01.720
Hey, have you seen this customer?

22:03.366 --> 22:05.366
Could you please try to remember?

22:05.537 --> 22:09.376
He used a check here on June 26.

22:09.507 --> 22:11.206
I'm not sure about the date,

22:11.476 --> 22:13.007
but I remember getting a check.

22:13.007 --> 22:14.646
I've never received one as a part-timer here.

22:15.416 --> 22:16.446
But...

22:17.216 --> 22:19.686
I don't remember what he looked like.

22:21.487 --> 22:22.956
Do you have a CCTV?

22:26.327 --> 22:28.757
He's only missing his right middle and ring fingers.

22:30.257 --> 22:32.666
No matter how meticulously you plan something,

22:32.666 --> 22:36.366
your habits come out like second nature.

22:36.567 --> 22:39.307
I'm sure there was a reason behind stripping her.

22:39.307 --> 22:41.676
He had to strip her to get off.

22:41.676 --> 22:45.347
And whoever did that is the real culprit.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.587
- Gil Pyo. - Hey.

22:57.587 --> 23:01.226
The culprit. He's probably missing two fingers, okay?

23:01.226 --> 23:03.027
Will you please stay quiet?

23:03.297 --> 23:06.097
The visitors who come to Seoul are over...

23:08.567 --> 23:10.267
How long will you treat us like a shadow?

23:10.267 --> 23:12.607
I didn't treat you like a shadow.

23:12.966 --> 23:15.436
You're banning a solid team from doing any work right now.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.607
You are treating us like a shadow.

23:17.737 --> 23:18.777
What is it?

23:18.946 --> 23:20.347
Be honest. Something is going on, right?

23:20.347 --> 23:21.976
No, nothing is going on.

23:21.976 --> 23:23.047
Look at this.

23:23.577 --> 23:25.787
I can always tell when you're lying.

23:25.787 --> 23:26.886
I know you.

23:29.156 --> 23:30.257
You can't fool me.

23:37.896 --> 23:39.567
Wait, one second.

23:41.866 --> 23:42.866
Okay.

23:45.107 --> 23:47.307
- Stay here. I'll go. - Okay.

23:49.876 --> 23:51.037
Hello.

23:52.676 --> 23:53.847
(Soju)

23:53.847 --> 23:55.446
A pack of cigarettes, please.

23:58.287 --> 23:59.987
That will be 3 dollars and 20 cents.

24:03.716 --> 24:04.787
Wait.

24:05.886 --> 24:07.057
Is that him?

24:15.067 --> 24:17.237
Your change is 1 dollar and 80 cents.

24:34.787 --> 24:36.317
Thank you. Goodbye.

24:39.757 --> 24:42.156
What? The guy who just went out.

24:45.926 --> 24:46.926
Just now?

24:46.926 --> 24:49.837
Yes, he looks like the man who just left.

24:49.837 --> 24:51.037
His clothes.

24:51.237 --> 24:52.567
Is that him?

25:05.916 --> 25:07.047
Mr. Cho Hyun Gil?

25:11.456 --> 25:12.557
Darn it.

25:22.037 --> 25:23.067
Cho Hyun Gil!

25:40.847 --> 25:42.716
Darn it.

25:43.216 --> 25:44.287
Cho Hyun Gil!

25:57.537 --> 25:58.767
Darn it.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.107
Captain Yoon.

26:05.906 --> 26:06.976
Cho Hyun Gil.

26:07.176 --> 26:09.676
You're under emergency arrest for Lee Soo Hyun's murder.

26:09.976 --> 26:11.946
You have the right to consult an attorney...

26:11.946 --> 26:14.416
and to remain silent, but do you have anything to say?

26:15.017 --> 26:16.216
Darn it!

26:20.626 --> 26:22.696
- Are you okay, Il Young? - Yes.

26:26.666 --> 26:29.366
Chief Heo, we caught him.

26:33.537 --> 26:34.607
We caught him!

26:35.237 --> 26:36.906
- Cho Hyun Gil? - Yes.

26:37.037 --> 26:38.136
What about his fingers?

26:43.247 --> 26:46.646
So you drank through the night on May 19,

26:46.847 --> 26:48.916
then abducted Lee Soo Hyun...

26:49.216 --> 26:51.087
around 3pm the next day.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.557
Is that correct?

26:55.857 --> 26:58.527
Why was your target Soo Hyun, a girl who was only five years old?

26:59.597 --> 27:00.666
I just...

27:04.896 --> 27:06.767
saw that girl there.

27:07.636 --> 27:09.406
Are you saying it wasn't planned?

27:14.676 --> 27:16.847
Did you kidnap Lee Soo Hyun, so you could...

27:18.176 --> 27:19.886
rape her?

27:21.087 --> 27:22.757
- No. - No?

27:24.817 --> 27:26.057
(Sexual assault)

27:26.057 --> 27:27.087
Cho Hyun Gil.

27:27.087 --> 27:29.857
You served time for molesting and assaulting a minor.

27:29.857 --> 27:32.196
And you were discharged in March.

27:33.196 --> 27:34.827
It's only been two months.

27:35.837 --> 27:36.866
Right?

27:38.636 --> 27:40.237
It hurts.

27:41.406 --> 27:42.436
Does it hurt?

27:43.876 --> 27:45.577
You think that hurts?

27:49.646 --> 27:50.747
Soo Hyun was...

27:51.577 --> 27:53.517
only five years old.

27:55.116 --> 27:58.087
- I was going to ask for money. - What money?

27:58.087 --> 28:00.726
I was going to ask for 2,000 dollars.

28:00.726 --> 28:01.726
What?

28:02.527 --> 28:04.297
I wanted a ransom.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.497
Two thousand dollars?

28:10.466 --> 28:12.267
Let us interview him too.

28:12.737 --> 28:15.007
Keep it down.

28:15.807 --> 28:18.176
I'll let you interview him...

28:18.176 --> 28:20.376
before he gets transferred to the prosecution.

28:20.376 --> 28:21.777
You just wait for now.

28:21.777 --> 28:23.577
You're just saying that. You'll just transfer him, right?

28:23.577 --> 28:24.777
No.

28:24.777 --> 28:26.416
Yes, you will. Come on.

28:27.317 --> 28:28.686
We must find out...

28:29.456 --> 28:31.487
where the other two fingers are.

28:35.997 --> 28:40.926
I was just going to ask for money at first. I'm telling the truth.

28:40.926 --> 28:41.997
But what?

28:48.466 --> 28:51.077
- Mom. - Hey.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.247
- Mom! - Don't cry. Why are you crying?

28:53.247 --> 28:54.307
Mom.

28:55.247 --> 28:57.716
Mom!

28:57.976 --> 28:59.946
Mom.

29:00.247 --> 29:02.757
- Darn it. - Mom.

29:05.226 --> 29:06.886
Good work.

29:07.726 --> 29:08.726
Let's go.

29:16.279 --> 29:18.525
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

29:20.037 --> 29:22.807
Cho Hyun Gil kidnapped a five-year-old girl, Lee Soo Hyun.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.176
Hey, kid.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.976
Do you want me to buy you ice cream?

29:28.716 --> 29:29.777
This one.

29:36.057 --> 29:39.186
He was going to demand a 2,000-dollar ransom.

29:41.357 --> 29:42.997
But Lee Soo Hyun got scared...

29:43.696 --> 29:46.027
and couldn't remember her parents' phone number.

29:47.196 --> 29:49.037
He forced her to drink water, spiked with sleeping pills.

29:52.406 --> 29:54.067
And a five-year-old girl, Lee Soo Hyun, was...

29:58.807 --> 30:01.507
(And a 5-year-old girl, Lee Soo Hyun, was...)

30:06.169 --> 30:07.870
(And a 5-year-old girl, Lee Soo Hyun, was...)

30:39.946 --> 30:41.047
Why did you do it?

30:45.686 --> 30:46.686
Can I...

30:47.886 --> 30:49.797
smoke a cigarette?

30:50.626 --> 30:52.926
You scumbag. How dare you ask for a cigarette?

30:56.737 --> 30:57.896
No, you can't.

31:00.507 --> 31:01.636
Cho Hyun Gil.

31:03.007 --> 31:04.577
How do you feel right now?

31:05.607 --> 31:07.847
- I'm sorry. - To whom?

31:11.577 --> 31:14.517
He's asking you to whom you're apologizing, you jerk!

31:14.686 --> 31:16.216
You scumbag.

31:17.456 --> 31:19.186
Let go of me. That jerk...

31:23.797 --> 31:25.696
Are you trying to cooperate or what?

31:25.696 --> 31:26.827
What?

31:26.827 --> 31:28.497
Don't interrupt us or provoke him.

31:28.497 --> 31:29.767
But I'm furious!

31:31.166 --> 31:33.136
How could you not be after looking at him?

31:35.607 --> 31:37.406
You know that my second child's name is Soo Hyun, right?

31:38.307 --> 31:40.047
- And my child is six years old. - Exactly.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.080
(Interview Room 2)

31:45.216 --> 31:49.587
That's why you must be infuriated right now.

31:52.126 --> 31:54.087
Don't come in. Stay out here.

31:54.087 --> 31:55.997
- Hey. I... - I'm asking you.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.057
Please.

31:59.567 --> 32:01.466
How did you lose your fingers?

32:01.997 --> 32:03.466
It happened when I was working.

32:04.936 --> 32:07.136
- Both of them? - Yes.

32:17.376 --> 32:18.716
When did it happen?

32:19.347 --> 32:22.757
I was 30. It was an accident at the construction site.

32:23.017 --> 32:24.557
Why didn't you reattach your fingers?

32:24.557 --> 32:26.057
My fingers flew out.

32:27.257 --> 32:28.726
I searched for hours.

32:29.297 --> 32:30.797
But I was bleeding a lot.

32:31.426 --> 32:32.997
In the end, I couldn't find them.

32:33.466 --> 32:36.666
I was at the construction site, so I didn't know where they went.

32:36.966 --> 32:38.237
You must have been in pain.

32:39.136 --> 32:41.366
- Yes. - Are you ashamed you don't have...

32:42.537 --> 32:43.777
all of your fingers?

32:46.277 --> 32:48.307
I think people treat me like I'm retarded.

32:48.476 --> 32:51.116
And women don't like that about you, right?

33:07.126 --> 33:08.767
We already caught the fish.

33:08.767 --> 33:10.636
Will that even help?

33:10.966 --> 33:13.067
We should think about if we'll slice it up or grill it.

33:13.067 --> 33:14.936
- I'll erase this. - Leave it.

33:16.136 --> 33:18.277
The Behavioral Analysis Team is still working on it.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.847
"We already caught the fish?"

33:21.946 --> 33:23.476
Are we here to fish?

No.

33:24.976 --> 33:26.317
(Child Dismemberment and Murder in Changeui-dong)

33:26.317 --> 33:27.487
I'll be more careful.

33:29.087 --> 33:33.087
By the way, we have to wait until they are done, right?

33:34.386 --> 33:37.827
I'm just curious. I wonder what they are talking about.

33:40.866 --> 33:42.267
But kids aren't like that.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.366
Even if you don't have fingers,

33:44.366 --> 33:45.767
they still approach you because they are innocent.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.237
Right.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.507
Kids are nice.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.706
Then how could you...

33:59.146 --> 34:00.946
Is that why you got rid of...

34:02.199 --> 34:03.540
two of Soo Hyun's fingers too?

34:18.099 --> 34:19.369
On the 12th,

34:19.369 --> 34:21.297
the police apprehended the culprit...

34:21.297 --> 34:23.639
behind the mutilated girl that was found in Changeui-dong.

34:24.938 --> 34:27.108
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency...

34:27.108 --> 34:29.208
stated that the culprit was Cho who lived around...

34:29.208 --> 34:31.438
where the body parts were found in Changeui-dong.

34:31.438 --> 34:33.007
And the police requested an arrest warrant...

34:33.007 --> 34:35.349
for murder and abandonment of a corpse.

34:35.547 --> 34:36.947
Severed body parts were found...

34:36.947 --> 34:38.478
in Changeui-dong, Bumyeong-dong,

34:38.478 --> 34:40.418
and at a motel in Gyeongseong-dong.

34:40.418 --> 34:42.289
But the police stated that...

34:42.289 --> 34:44.858
two of the girl's fingers could not be found.

34:45.088 --> 34:47.688

Choi Yoon Ji has always been a bit different back in school too.

50:22.367 --> 50:24.898
I guess you can say that's her strength too.

50:25.768 --> 50:27.007
I don't think that.

50:27.268 --> 50:30.308
I'm grateful she chose to work here.

50:31.878 --> 50:33.947
Yes, I'm grateful.

50:34.248 --> 50:36.648
But I still need to make a living.

50:37.018 --> 50:38.478
What's the point of being a conscious reporter...

50:38.478 --> 50:40.788
when the media is crumbling down?

50:41.087 --> 50:43.217
Yes, that's right.

50:43.657 --> 50:45.317
Don't just talk about it, but put it to action.

50:49.157 --> 50:51.828
- Is your hangover bad? - I'm all right.

50:52.558 --> 50:54.967
Do you even remember drunk dialing me yesterday...

50:54.967 --> 50:56.737
and how you harassed me by saying how miserable you are?

51:00.208 --> 51:01.808
I didn't say that because I was drunk.

51:02.637 --> 51:05.078
I get it. It wasn't an easy case.

51:05.637 --> 51:07.808
Good job. You did well.

51:08.208 --> 51:09.717
But don't think that your job as a reporter...

51:09.717 --> 51:11.018
starts and finishes with appealing to the reader's emotions.

51:11.317 --> 51:12.418
You see, a reporter...

51:12.418 --> 51:15.047
That's enough advice for today, Director.

51:15.648 --> 51:17.257
What's with the, "But?"

51:17.257 --> 51:18.518
Why do you think so?

51:19.518 --> 51:21.128
It's because that's my role, you rascal.

51:22.328 --> 51:23.558
Let's get some food to soothe your stomach.

51:23.558 --> 51:25.598
I need to get going in a bit.

51:25.598 --> 51:27.467
At least get a bite of food in before you leave.

51:27.728 --> 51:28.927
You'll upset your stomach.

51:29.427 --> 51:30.598
All right, I'll eat before I go.

51:31.333 --> 51:33.072
Aren't we done since we caught him?

51:33.703 --> 51:36.612
Even if everyone else thinks that way...

51:36.612 --> 51:38.112
we have to think about what comes after.

51:38.413 --> 51:39.712
- After this? - Yes.

51:39.987 --> 51:42.427
- Analyzing the mind. - "Analyzing the mind?"

51:42.427 --> 51:44.257
It's true that criminal profiling...

51:44.257 --> 51:46.627
is used in order to catch the culprit.

51:46.797 --> 51:48.596
But what comes after that is extremely important too.

51:48.596 --> 51:50.866
What does that have to do with analyzing the mind though?

51:52.136 --> 51:53.636
It's not over because we caught the culprit.

51:53.936 --> 51:55.567
There will always be another one who appears.

51:55.567 --> 51:56.607
Hold on.

51:56.936 --> 51:59.607
You said you were going to speak comfortably to me.

52:04.777 --> 52:05.777
Did I say that?

52:05.777 --> 52:08.647
I'll speak comfortably to you if you don't do it first.

52:08.886 --> 52:11.116
Why don't you go ahead and do that, since we're talking about it?

52:11.116 --> 52:12.357
Should I do that then?

52:17.326 --> 52:18.397
Captain Yoon!

52:19.556 --> 52:22.967
Over here, Captain Yoon! Come sit here.

52:23.266 --> 52:25.936
- We'll sit over there with them. - Okay.

52:26.197 --> 52:28.737
We just need to bring a chair over.

52:28.737 --> 52:30.737
We just got started eating too, so let's eat together.

52:30.877 --> 52:32.036
Yes, we'll join this table.

52:32.036 --> 52:34.377
Two more orders of the set please, ma'am!

52:34.377 --> 52:36.246
- Got it! - Please excuse us then.

52:36.576 --> 52:39.547
What's there to excuse? We're all on the same team.

52:42.917 --> 52:44.616
Carry on with your conversation.

52:44.616 --> 52:46.627
It seems like we interrupted it.

52:46.927 --> 52:48.627
Whether criminals who committed serious crimes...

52:48.627 --> 52:51.127
can be rehabilitated in prison or not.

52:51.456 --> 52:54.667
Or if the rehabilitation program needs some sort of change.

52:54.667 --> 52:55.927
Or if there is a chance they'll repeat the crime.

52:55.927 --> 52:58.766
We have to figure those things out. That's what we were talking about.

52:59.096 --> 53:00.967
Cho Hyun Gil committed the same crime in the end...

53:00.967 --> 53:02.936
after just two months of being released.

53:03.277 --> 53:06.576
That's why you want to interview Cho Hyun Gil!

53:06.746 --> 53:09.007
What? You're interviewing Cho Hyun Gil again?

53:09.206 --> 53:11.016
There's a lot we have to ask him.

53:11.576 --> 53:13.447
Not only is he our team's first case...

53:13.647 --> 53:15.717
but if we want to write our report on criminal psychology analysis...

53:15.717 --> 53:18.257
I think we'll have to meet him at least once more.

53:18.556 --> 53:20.326
This team is always working very hard.

53:21.357 --> 53:22.956
If we want people to know that the Behavioral Analysis Team...

53:22.956 --> 53:26.567
contributes to catching the culprit, we'll have to work harder.

53:26.897 --> 53:28.266
We have to show that it's not interest that motivates us...

53:28.697 --> 53:30.737
but our sense of duty instead.

53:33.067 --> 53:36.536
It may just be an intriguing case to you and your team,

53:36.536 --> 53:38.237
but my team has a duty to solve it.

53:43.277 --> 53:46.786
Whatever the case, more heinous criminals will show up.

53:47.547 --> 53:49.147
I hope my guess is wrong.

53:49.147 --> 53:50.357
I'd be happy if I'm wrong.

53:50.987 --> 53:54.357
But there still has to be someone preparing for what may happen.

53:57.096 --> 53:58.596
Thank you!

53:59.226 --> 54:00.897
We have more than enough already.

54:00.897 --> 54:04.096
Just how much more heinous will they get for us to need to prepare?

54:06.167 --> 54:07.766
Daesung Serial Murder Case.

54:12.436 --> 54:14.377
That punk. We even released his montage...

54:14.377 --> 54:16.007
but why won't he get caught?

54:16.246 --> 54:18.877
Those punks that commit serial murders...

54:19.177 --> 54:22.087
aren't in the range of normal that we think of.

54:22.547 --> 54:25.056
It's hard to track them down the way we normally do.

54:25.257 --> 54:28.927
What do you mean it's hard to track them down...

54:28.927 --> 54:30.257
the way we normally do?

54:30.257 --> 54:32.427
If we look at the pattern of a crime...

54:32.427 --> 54:36.536
we can tell to an extent whether it was resentment or blind passion.

54:36.536 --> 54:38.866
That's right. It's clear as day.

54:38.866 --> 54:40.507
But when it's none of these...

54:45.237 --> 54:48.047
Guys who commit crimes randomly and recklessly...

54:48.047 --> 54:49.647
we can't read their behavior pattern.

54:49.647 --> 54:52.377
Why is that? Because they don't belong to any category.

54:52.647 --> 54:55.616
Are you saying that's the case with the Daesung Serial Murder Case?

54:55.886 --> 54:56.917
That's right.

54:57.917 --> 54:59.556
Once our team settles down...

54:59.927 --> 55:02.226
he's the first one I want to catch.

55:03.826 --> 55:05.197
He'll be caught before that.

55:06.297 --> 55:07.596
Even though he stopped,

55:08.027 --> 55:09.837
our investigation will continue.

55:09.837 --> 55:11.096
Yes, he has to be caught.

55:11.522 --> 55:14.422
He's the most wanted criminal by the Korean police.

55:15.679 --> 55:17.090
Please excuse me.

55:17.536 --> 55:19.846
Wait for us. We're almost done too.

55:19.947 --> 55:21.877
It's okay. You can take your time to eat.

55:22.107 --> 55:23.277
Please excuse me.

55:23.602 --> 55:26.102
- It's on me. Just go. - Thank you.

55:30.616 --> 55:35.257

Anyway, what does that have to do with a potentially atrocious case?

56:08.574 --> 56:09.603
Listen up.

56:10.043 --> 56:13.813
In the US, heinous criminals who only seek to murder...

56:13.813 --> 56:16.943
began to surface during their biggest economic change.

56:16.943 --> 56:18.744
There's a report on the correlation.

56:19.644 --> 56:21.753
That's why we must be prepared.

56:23.753 --> 56:25.124
Anyhow,

56:25.583 --> 56:28.793
Daesung Serial Murder Case was way too shocking for me,

56:28.793 --> 56:30.023
so I studied it extensively.

56:30.693 --> 56:33.193
After I saw the cases from overseas, I saw that...

56:33.394 --> 56:34.994
they're like smart criminals.

56:35.534 --> 56:38.704
Their brains are wired only to murder.

56:39.034 --> 56:42.034
That's why their MO and patterns evolve over time.

56:42.034 --> 56:43.074
(Grass field in Uhyeong-ri, waterway in Hyungsan-ri)

56:43.074 --> 56:44.374
Here's what I mean.

56:44.644 --> 56:47.614
That the atrocity of their murder and their crimes...

56:47.614 --> 56:49.313
will be taken to an extreme.

56:50.043 --> 56:53.353
That's why they change the patterns in an attempt to flee from us.

56:55.583 --> 56:59.023
When they change the pattern and the MO, catching them...

56:59.483 --> 57:02.193
will be even harder.

57:03.364 --> 57:05.463
If we do not get prepared,

57:05.824 --> 57:09.664
we'll see another cold case like the Daesung Serial Murder.

57:13.434 --> 57:14.434
I see.

57:14.534 --> 57:16.273
It'd be wonderful if it doesn't happen.

57:16.474 --> 57:20.213
I'm just trying to be prepared, for just ten years.

57:21.344 --> 57:23.883
I want to put in some work for just ten years.

57:24.583 --> 57:26.514
Then will our team last for ten years?

57:26.753 --> 57:28.514
- Can you do this? - Yes, I can, sir.

57:30.153 --> 57:33.494
Anyway, thank you for listening to my boring story.

57:33.494 --> 57:34.653
Lunch is on me.

57:34.653 --> 57:36.124
No, it's all right.

57:36.124 --> 57:38.094
Thank you so much. Thank you for lunch.

57:52.344 --> 57:53.744
I have finally gone insane.

57:54.074 --> 57:55.074
What's wrong?

57:55.474 --> 57:56.543
My wallet.

57:58.614 --> 58:00.813
- I'll pay. - No.

58:01.483 --> 58:02.554
That's not what I meant.

58:06.153 --> 58:08.753
- Captain Yoon. - Oh, thank you.

58:09.653 --> 58:12.423
Captain Yoon, something he said has been bugging me.

58:13.793 --> 58:14.864
What is?

58:15.394 --> 58:18.403
I mean, no matter how crazy we are, we have to say the right things.

58:18.403 --> 58:20.773
To be frank, we caught Cho Hyun Gil.

58:20.903 --> 58:24.244
Okay, I give them credit for analyzing him and stuff.

58:24.244 --> 58:26.273
But so what?

58:26.273 --> 58:28.414
It's not like we don't try to guess what the culprit is like.

58:28.414 --> 58:30.744
We just can't be right all the time.

58:30.744 --> 58:33.083
And if you think about it, the same goes for that team.

58:33.483 --> 58:36.353
They somehow ended up guessing Cho Hyun Gil right.

58:36.353 --> 58:37.983
They can't say they took part in...

58:37.983 --> 58:39.624
That's mine.

58:40.024 --> 58:42.753
Why? Did they say they caught Cho Hyun Gil?

58:43.724 --> 58:45.264
No, it's not like that.

58:45.264 --> 58:47.793
I knew they'd get cheeky.

58:47.793 --> 58:50.304
I told you not to let them take credit.

58:50.304 --> 58:52.403
They should be grateful that they still have a job.

58:52.403 --> 58:54.574
Everyone knows about the Red Cap Incident.
