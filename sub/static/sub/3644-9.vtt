If there's someone you want
to say goodbye to, now's the time.

00:09.433 --> 00:11.810
I just wanted to say that I love you both.

00:11.835 --> 00:13.323
So what is the problem, son?

00:13.348 --> 00:14.488
I have a great girlfriend.

00:14.512 --> 00:15.847
You have a girlfriend?

00:15.872 --> 00:17.949
Benjamin, are you there?

00:17.974 --> 00:19.893
- Did Ed Clark commit suicide?
- No.

00:19.918 --> 00:21.588
- How did he die?
- Protecting you.

00:21.613 --> 00:24.189
Hey, Fisher, Ed Clark didn't
commit suicide. He was murdered.

00:24.214 --> 00:25.307
Is Kirsten home?

00:25.332 --> 00:26.854
- Who is Liam?
- My boyfriend.

00:26.879 --> 00:28.604
Kirsten has never mentioned him.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.731
Okay, find out everything you can
about him. I want a full report.

00:31.756 --> 00:33.571
- You think it's him?
- My gut says yes,

00:33.596 --> 00:36.069
and if there is even a chance.

00:38.047 --> 00:39.781
Will you marry me?

Listen, I have to make them
perfect to match your crêpes.

00:57.972 --> 01:01.238
I am used to frozen waffles.

01:03.101 --> 01:05.001
You're spoiling me.

01:05.027 --> 01:07.538
That's the plan.

01:14.696 --> 01:16.263
What are you doing?

01:16.288 --> 01:17.989
I'm seeing what your hair looks like up.

01:18.014 --> 01:19.881
I like it.

01:20.143 --> 01:22.789
Well, maybe one day I'll surprise you.

01:26.715 --> 01:28.667
(cell phone beeps)

01:28.692 --> 01:33.405
You got a text... from Cameron.

01:33.430 --> 01:36.014
- Thanks.
- Who's Maggie?

01:36.521 --> 01:38.715
Oh, just someone at work.

01:38.740 --> 01:39.928
You in trouble?

01:40.123 --> 01:42.309
I can handle her.

01:42.671 --> 01:44.710
This looks amazing.

01:44.735 --> 01:46.702
We could eat like this every morning.

01:46.727 --> 01:49.812
Right, and then we would be 500 pounds.

01:50.366 --> 01:53.311
Seriously. You, me, domestic bliss.

01:53.337 --> 01:55.610
God, I'm so hungry.

01:55.635 --> 01:58.610
Kirsten, have you given
any thought to my proposal?

02:00.105 --> 02:01.573
(cell phone beeps)

02:01.628 --> 02:04.196
Another software emergency?

02:04.221 --> 02:08.211
I'm sorry. We're... on a deadline.

02:08.235 --> 02:10.225
- Can you save it?
- No.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.378
But more for me. So when do I get to play

02:12.403 --> 02:14.304
this big secret game you're designing?

02:14.570 --> 02:15.938
Someday.

02:15.963 --> 02:19.090
They're just really strict
about keeping it under wraps.

02:19.429 --> 02:21.790
Thank you for being so patient.

02:21.815 --> 02:23.890
So we'll talk about us later?

02:25.065 --> 02:26.982
- Promise?
- I do.

02:27.007 --> 02:29.290
The two words I'm hoping to hear.

02:57.271 --> 03:00.600
Good morning, people. Isn't
it a great day to be alive?

03:00.625 --> 03:01.930
You're a happy camper today.

03:01.955 --> 03:04.215
Yeah, 'cause the last time I
was in here, we almost died.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.675
Now the sun is shining,
the flowers are a-bloom,

03:06.700 --> 03:08.854
and I work with the
greatest team in the world.

03:08.879 --> 03:13.813
- Churros for... ♪ everyone. ♪
- Churros, the extruded cousin of the beignet.

03:13.838 --> 03:14.938
Thanks, anyways.

03:14.963 --> 03:16.563
I'll put these in the break room for you.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.063
Do not throw those out.

03:18.088 --> 03:20.165
So I got a funny story.

03:20.190 --> 03:23.762
Remember when Maggie told us to
call our loved ones and say goodbye?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.759
Yeah, but we lived to tell
the tale. How fab is that?

03:25.784 --> 03:28.665
Yeah, so I told my parents
that I had a girlfriend...

03:28.690 --> 03:31.592
a serious girlfriend... to make them happy.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.668
That's sort of sweet.

03:33.693 --> 03:37.429
Yeah, so they were so happy,
they insisted on meeting her.

03:37.883 --> 03:40.952
So what do you say to dinner
tonight, 8:00, my house?

03:40.977 --> 03:43.268
You told them I'm the serious girlfriend?

03:43.293 --> 03:45.968
Like you said, you know, sort of sweet.

03:47.756 --> 03:51.129
I'm just gonna remain upbeat,
and I'm gonna cheerily request

03:51.154 --> 03:53.706
that you cancel that dinner
and tell your parents the truth.

03:53.731 --> 03:56.667
Tell them that we all almost died

03:56.692 --> 03:58.461
in an outbreak in our secret lab?

03:58.486 --> 04:01.223
- Tell them we broke up.
- Come on, they'd be heartbroken.

04:01.248 --> 04:03.416
Over a bogus relationship?
This is ridiculous.

04:03.441 --> 04:06.322
Wait, just meet them, okay?

04:06.347 --> 04:09.013
Prove to them that you actually exist

04:09.038 --> 04:11.423
and then we can break up.

04:11.503 --> 04:12.836
Call an escort service.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.910
Yeah, but I've already described you.

04:18.666 --> 04:22.125
My mom's really excited. She's
making her world class chicken tikka.

04:22.151 --> 04:24.473
- Masala?
- And homemade naan.

04:24.498 --> 04:28.073
Okay, one dinner. Then
I'm dumping your lying ass.

04:32.919 --> 04:35.654
Is there a problem?

04:35.679 --> 04:37.390
Let's talk...

04:38.432 --> 04:40.974
Before someone turns into one.

04:42.905 --> 04:47.289
Your boyfriend and potential
fiancé, from what I understand.

04:47.314 --> 04:49.496
You called me in here to talk about Liam?

04:49.521 --> 04:53.658
What we do and who we associate with in our
personal lives can present a security risk.

04:53.683 --> 04:55.666
I haven't told Liam
anything about the program.

04:55.864 --> 04:58.466
And how's that working for you?

04:58.491 --> 05:01.466
Not great. I'm running out of excuses.

05:01.491 --> 05:03.258
What do you really know about him?

05:03.283 --> 05:05.365
He's an anthropologist, correct?

05:05.390 --> 05:08.689
He's off traveling the world,
then shows up at your door,

05:08.714 --> 05:12.566
charms his way back into your
life and pops the question.

05:12.591 --> 05:17.268
- What's wrong with that?
- The timing. He didn't come back until you got involved

05:17.293 --> 05:18.855
with the Stitchers Program.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.817
He finished his fellowship.
Liam's not a problem.

05:22.842 --> 05:24.430
That's all you need to know.

05:28.958 --> 05:33.161
Maggie's former C.I.A. What did you expect?

05:33.473 --> 05:36.761
My private life has nothing to
do with the Stitchers Program.

05:37.589 --> 05:39.749
And since when do you eat churros?

05:39.774 --> 05:43.377
Since 15 minutes ago, but please
hide the box. I've had three already.

05:43.402 --> 05:46.678
You know what? My relationship with
Liam is just none of Maggie's business.

05:46.703 --> 05:48.604
Not that it's any of mine,

05:48.629 --> 05:52.159
but are you gonna marry him?

05:52.184 --> 05:54.701
I haven't given him an answer yet.

05:54.726 --> 05:56.841
So you're still debating
Mr. Perfect's proposal?

05:56.866 --> 05:58.867
Oh, great. So you're against him, too?

05:58.892 --> 06:02.110
I'm sorry. That wasn't
called for. Liam's a good guy.

06:02.135 --> 06:05.410
Look, I have a hard enough
time sorting out my past.

06:05.435 --> 06:09.305
I need to consider my future
with a certain degree of caution.

06:09.330 --> 06:10.883
I want to be sure he's the one.

06:11.050 --> 06:13.985
You're never gonna be sure.

06:14.010 --> 06:16.509
The future doesn't come with guarantees.

06:16.534 --> 06:17.935
That is true.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.509
Hey, buddy, pal.

06:22.534 --> 06:23.700
Sir.

06:23.725 --> 06:25.081
Better.

06:25.116 --> 06:29.324
- Give us a minute, huh?
- Yeah.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.124
Try the churros.

06:33.525 --> 06:35.693
Sorry I didn't get back
to you about your message,

06:35.718 --> 06:38.996
but we've been down this road
before. The Ed Clark case is closed.

06:39.021 --> 06:40.956
Right, remember when I
told you I couldn't wait

06:40.990 --> 06:42.771
- to prove you wrong about Ed's suicide?
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.796 --> 06:45.966
Les Turner told me that Ed
died trying to protect me.

06:45.991 --> 06:48.537
- Turner?
- He's the director of the Stitchers Program.

06:48.562 --> 06:51.389
Yeah, I know who Turner is.
Who was Ed protecting you from?

06:51.414 --> 06:53.036
He didn't say.

06:54.599 --> 06:57.468
All right, I'll ask him,
find out what he knows.

06:57.493 --> 07:00.236
He's not exactly what
you'd call accessible.

07:00.261 --> 07:02.635
Lately, I've had his attention.

07:04.820 --> 07:08.355
Embrace your adventures
with a positive energy

07:08.380 --> 07:10.347
and the universe will reward you.

07:10.372 --> 07:12.905
Vanessa Sawyer, 24,
self-proclaimed psychic.

07:12.930 --> 07:14.798
She co-hosted an online show.

07:14.823 --> 07:16.924
Gave advice, answered questions.

07:16.949 --> 07:21.453
Hot mess in Reseda, you're
involved in a competition,

07:21.478 --> 07:23.253
but lack confidence.

07:23.278 --> 07:27.181
But the king of wands says that you
show potential. Believe in yourself.

07:27.206 --> 07:31.082
Vanessa's co-host Jessica
Barnes goes by the name Solaris.

07:31.107 --> 07:34.118
- Of course she does.
- Solaris got back in town this morning

07:34.143 --> 07:36.044
and discovered Vanessa's body at home.

07:36.069 --> 07:37.854
- She was bludgeoned.
- With?

07:37.879 --> 07:39.854
A geode.

07:39.879 --> 07:41.655
That is a big rock.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.455
- Ouch.
- Any suspects?

07:43.480 --> 07:45.614
According to the police,
there was no forced entry,

07:45.639 --> 07:48.792
nothing stolen, so a robbery is unlikely.

07:48.817 --> 07:50.284
So she knew her killer.

07:50.309 --> 07:53.081
But so far, no known enemies
and no reported threats.

07:53.106 --> 07:57.743
Fisher is going to go to the Dreamcatcher
Studios where she produced the show.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.869
Why don't we ask the psychic
Solaris who killed her?

07:59.894 --> 08:02.866
Maybe she can tell us. Give
us some stock tips, too.

08:02.891 --> 08:05.659
I prefer a more scientific approach.

08:05.684 --> 08:09.466
Yeah, stitching is
basically talking to ghosts.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.565
Well, it is.

08:15.701 --> 08:17.768
- Blood pressure sensor online.
- All right,

08:17.793 --> 08:19.527
stations, please.

08:19.552 --> 08:21.470
Lights to 20%.

08:21.928 --> 08:24.001
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

08:24.026 --> 08:25.456
- Life-sci?
- Go.

08:25.481 --> 08:26.740
- Sub-bio?
- Good to go.

08:26.765 --> 08:27.898
- Engineering?
- Go.

08:27.923 --> 08:31.099
- Communications?
- Go. We're always a go.

08:31.124 --> 08:33.259
Protocol, Linus. Protocols.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.881
- Comm check, Kirsten. One, two, one, two.
- I'm with you.

08:35.907 --> 08:38.909
Something here doesn't make sense.
Let's go poke it with a stick.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.636
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

08:40.662 --> 08:46.135
In three, two, one... Mark.

08:49.592 --> 08:52.594
Um, Cameron?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.687
You took a wrong turn.

08:54.712 --> 08:55.951
Where are you?

08:55.976 --> 08:58.978
Outer space.

08:59.003 --> 09:01.135
What?

09:06.489 --> 09:10.358
Oh, never mind. I'm at the studio.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.811
I love it.

09:11.836 --> 09:13.711
We should've changed it months ago.

09:13.736 --> 09:16.711
- So the space thing?
- Just the backdrop for their show.

09:28.428 --> 09:30.563
Jengirl22,

09:30.588 --> 09:33.790
your future is full of possibilities.

09:33.832 --> 09:36.015
Don't be afraid to take chances.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.098
Vanessa's giving advice.

09:38.123 --> 09:42.360
The search brings happiness,
not the destination.

09:42.385 --> 09:43.860
If you decide to...

09:43.885 --> 09:48.660
- (electricity sparks)
- A light sparked.

09:55.610 --> 09:58.494
She's watching a couple argue.

10:01.871 --> 10:05.407
There's a fire around them.

10:05.432 --> 10:09.891
But it's not really there, but it's
like she's sensing something about them.

10:09.916 --> 10:12.573
Can you move her closer
to the time of the murder?

10:12.811 --> 10:15.913
Follow the glutamate levels
to their largest spike point.

10:15.938 --> 10:19.158
- I've been watching.
- Apparently.

10:19.183 --> 10:22.828
Hang on, Oda Mae. I'm moving you
as close to the murder as I can.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.738
(gagging)

10:26.809 --> 10:29.150
I'm not at Vanessa's murder.

10:31.574 --> 10:36.098
- (electricity sparks)
- (beeping)

10:37.853 --> 10:39.582
(panting)

10:43.874 --> 10:45.650
Did you see who killed her?

10:45.675 --> 10:48.049
I saw someone else get killed.

10:48.074 --> 10:51.349
Vanessa got killed because
she witnessed a murder.

10:58.129 --> 11:01.603
You stitched in to find evidence
of Vanessa Sawyer's murder.

11:01.628 --> 11:05.740
Yes, and someone must have
killed her to shut her up.

11:05.765 --> 11:08.500
- She saw this other woman get choked to death...
- But I've checked.

11:08.534 --> 11:12.671
No homicides, no missing person reports
that fit the description you gave me.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.539
Maybe no one's found her body yet.

11:14.574 --> 11:19.067
(sighs) We need to focus
on the body we have.

11:19.092 --> 11:22.557
Look, whoever that woman was, if we find
her killer, we will find Vanessa's too,

11:22.582 --> 11:24.179
and I think they both worked here.

11:24.204 --> 11:26.472
Lots of potential suspects.

11:28.767 --> 11:31.505
That's the guy I saw arguing
with her in the stitch.

11:31.729 --> 11:33.508
With Vanessa?

11:33.948 --> 11:35.960
No, with the woman who was strangled.

11:35.985 --> 11:37.756
That makes him our prime suspect.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.456
For a murder we
don't know has happened.

11:45.081 --> 11:47.925
I know what I saw. You explain it.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.626
Stitch glitch.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.725
And what's with your hairdo?

11:52.750 --> 11:56.376
Yeah, I own the place. Vanessa
started shooting here six months ago.

11:56.401 --> 11:58.268
Terrible thing, a young girl like that.

11:58.293 --> 12:00.767
Yeah, just when the money
started flowing in, too.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.466
Can I help you with something?

12:02.491 --> 12:03.524
They're with me.

12:03.549 --> 12:06.251
What is this, "bring
your kids to work" day?

12:06.276 --> 12:09.329
No, it's "interrogate a
douche" day. Go ahead, Dad.

12:10.311 --> 12:12.812
What did you mean the money was flowing in?

12:12.837 --> 12:14.130
I thought it was free to watch online.

12:14.155 --> 12:17.958
Her channel's free, but the
private readings she did,

12:17.983 --> 12:20.591
online sales. It's the future of revenue.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.350
And you get a piece of the action.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.974
Everyone comes here a nobody with a dream.

12:25.999 --> 12:29.815
I see something there, I invest in them,
make their dreams come true.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.466
You're a regular fairy godfather.

12:32.491 --> 12:35.907
Who was that woman Vanessa
saw you arguing with?

12:35.932 --> 12:37.407
Excuse me.

12:37.432 --> 12:42.203
You got into it with
someone, a very stylish woman.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.308
I thought this was about Vanessa.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.308
It is. Why don't we speak over here?

12:52.712 --> 12:56.094
It's hard enough trying to explain how you
know about murders that really happened.

12:56.119 --> 12:58.449
That woman was killed.

12:58.474 --> 13:02.395
And her murder is connected to Vanessa's.
Why else would it be in her memory?

13:03.451 --> 13:06.594
Man, some of the posts on Vanessa's show.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.520
People get nasty when her
predictions don't come true.

13:09.545 --> 13:11.546
Pissed enough to kill her?

13:11.571 --> 13:13.438
"You lying bitch.

13:13.463 --> 13:16.074
"I flew out to Miami to surprise
my boyfriend like you said,

13:16.099 --> 13:20.169
"and found him in bed with
my sister. Please die."

13:20.194 --> 13:22.465
That's from N.J. in Los Angeles.

13:22.490 --> 13:26.851
Okay, ready or not... Meet
the parents outfit number one.

13:26.876 --> 13:28.715
You look like a librarian.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.945
You said not to show too much skin.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.937
I didn't say not to show any.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.887
Outfit number two it is.

13:35.912 --> 13:37.660
I can help with the buttons.

13:43.494 --> 13:44.494
(clears throat)

13:44.519 --> 13:47.040
No, my folks will freak.

13:47.065 --> 13:49.757
Linus, what do you want from me?

13:49.821 --> 13:52.689
Maybe dress more like

13:52.732 --> 13:55.441
someone my parents won't
have a coronary meeting.

13:55.466 --> 13:57.630
I am at all times myself.

13:57.655 --> 14:02.641
Of course, but maybe you could
just show them 10% of yourself.

14:03.788 --> 14:05.756
Look at this 10%.

14:07.188 --> 14:08.922
It's a good 10%.

14:12.026 --> 14:15.211
I can't believe anyone
would want to hurt her.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.764
Vanessa had such a big heart.

14:19.903 --> 14:22.165
She was pure light,

14:22.190 --> 14:24.564
but she did see a darkness coming.

14:24.589 --> 14:27.322
You mean sensed it

14:27.347 --> 14:29.744
in a poetic, allegorical way?

14:29.769 --> 14:31.471
No, she saw it.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.197
Here in the studio.

14:33.222 --> 14:37.055
I said we could move spaces, but
we were stuck in our contract.

14:37.080 --> 14:42.246
She saw the darkness, and now she's gone.

14:43.612 --> 14:45.613
A doubter.

14:46.790 --> 14:48.796
Do you ever get a "bad vibe"?

14:48.821 --> 14:51.546
Something that makes
your hair stand on end?

14:51.571 --> 14:53.645
My hair's always like this.

14:55.293 --> 14:57.427
We all have natural intuition.

14:57.452 --> 14:59.946
People like me and Vanessa
just have more of it.

14:59.971 --> 15:04.960
So the "darkness" she spoke
about, was she specific?

15:04.985 --> 15:07.853
Our visions, premonitions,

15:07.878 --> 15:11.046
however you want to call it,
they're not always literal.

15:16.052 --> 15:19.523
Like fire, for instance,
it could represent...

15:19.548 --> 15:22.773
Anger, tension.

15:24.644 --> 15:27.746
You're struggling with a decision.

15:28.211 --> 15:32.673
You need to know yourself before
you can share your life with anyone.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.673
You have a very sensitive heart.

15:40.237 --> 15:43.173
You need to protect it.

15:45.970 --> 15:51.273
Here, take this. It will keep you safe.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.572
I will do that.

15:56.459 --> 15:59.473
We're very sorry about your friend.

16:01.743 --> 16:04.983
Of course I'm sorry, too, but
that woman is a whack-a-doodle.

16:05.070 --> 16:08.937
Oh, so when something isn't explained by
science, you immediately think it's nuts.

16:08.962 --> 16:10.836
She gave me a rock.

16:10.861 --> 16:13.235
She knew about your heart.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.936
In the most general terms.

16:15.961 --> 16:18.921
You're a person of science, okay?

16:18.946 --> 16:20.650
You're not supposed to believe in magic.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.000
Science is just magic
that's been explained.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.383
- What, you trying to spook me? Yeah, I'm so scared...
- (pops)

16:27.807 --> 16:30.290
I saw that happen in Vanessa's memory.

16:30.315 --> 16:32.216
- What?
- That light sparking.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.306
- She had a premonition.
- It's a coincidence.

16:41.308 --> 16:45.900
That's her. The woman who was strangled.

16:45.925 --> 16:48.674
She looks damn good, considering.

16:48.699 --> 16:52.235
I guess Vanessa didn't
witness her murder after all.

16:52.965 --> 16:54.933
Unless she did see it,

16:54.958 --> 16:58.201
and it just hasn't happened yet.

17:01.265 --> 17:04.218
We're just both so shocked about Vanessa.

17:04.242 --> 17:07.179
Terrible. Devastating.

17:07.204 --> 17:09.717
She's the whole reason
behind my event tonight.

17:09.916 --> 17:13.886
I'm making a big splash to launch my brand.

17:13.911 --> 17:15.912
Ah, congratulations.

17:15.936 --> 17:19.736
I thought about canceling,
but I'm trying to stay positive

17:19.761 --> 17:23.297
and keep the energy clear.
It's what she would have wanted.

17:23.321 --> 17:25.589
So Vanessa did readings for you?

17:25.615 --> 17:27.515
All the time. She was so inspiring.

17:27.540 --> 17:32.217
Just wondering if she
predicted any trouble for you.

17:32.242 --> 17:34.616
We're thinking about shooting a show here,

17:34.641 --> 17:38.016
and word is things can get pretty intense.

17:40.103 --> 17:43.072
The owner, Rick Hauser.

17:43.097 --> 17:46.130
Make sure you read the
fine print on your contract.

17:46.155 --> 17:49.546
So, like, once you take his
startup money, he owns you for life?

17:49.571 --> 17:53.240
Exactly. I've been busting my
ass, making a name for myself.

17:53.265 --> 17:56.271
I'm finally ready to fly, and he's
like a giant weight tying me down.

17:56.296 --> 17:57.919
Has he ever threatened you?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.989
To ride my coattails and suck me dry?

18:01.014 --> 18:03.090
Absolutely.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.028
Listen, I've got a million
things to do before tonight.

18:06.053 --> 18:08.628
A lot of pretty people will
be there. You guys should come.

18:08.653 --> 18:13.128
We'll be there. Yeah.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.628
- Couldn't resist.
- (kisses)

18:19.237 --> 18:21.104
We'll be there?

18:21.129 --> 18:23.895
If her murder is supposed to happen
tonight, maybe we can stop it.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.494
Oh, and for a second I thought
you weren't gonna make any sense.

18:55.152 --> 18:56.919
Don't be afraid.

18:56.944 --> 19:00.013
Sometimes the future seems daunting.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.840
So many choices and decisions,

19:02.865 --> 19:05.867
but surround yourself with people you love,

19:05.892 --> 19:07.596
listen to your heart,

19:07.621 --> 19:11.725
and keep on creating your
own happily ever after.

19:14.259 --> 19:17.759
- Good story?
- They all end the same.

19:17.784 --> 19:20.001
The girl marries the prince.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.501
And they live happily ever after.

19:22.526 --> 19:24.900
I don't want to get married.

19:26.443 --> 19:29.700
You don't have to.

19:29.725 --> 19:32.400
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

19:32.604 --> 19:36.001
But I want to know what happy is.

19:38.017 --> 19:40.801
You are a very smart girl,

19:40.826 --> 19:44.423
and you can accomplish anything
that you set your mind to,

19:44.448 --> 19:47.349
just like your mother. And
someday, you might find someone

19:47.630 --> 19:50.478
that you love who loves you back.

19:50.503 --> 19:52.078
You haven't.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.928
I did.

19:56.368 --> 19:58.035
Once.

19:59.477 --> 20:01.135
And I might again.

20:01.481 --> 20:04.135
Who knows what the future will bring?

20:05.276 --> 20:08.935
Kirsten, earth to Kirsten.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.712
Hey. How was your run?

20:13.737 --> 20:16.639
It was pretty weird, actually.
Someone was following me.

20:16.664 --> 20:17.935
Should I be jealous?

20:18.023 --> 20:20.024
It was an S.U.V.

20:20.675 --> 20:22.780
Did you see the driver?

20:22.805 --> 20:26.541
- He sped away.
- That is weird.

20:26.566 --> 20:30.503
It made me wonder actually if it
might have something to do with you.

20:30.528 --> 20:31.600
Me?

20:31.625 --> 20:34.900
You keep running off to this
mysterious job. Now I'm being followed?

20:34.925 --> 20:37.299
Who exactly do you work for?

20:37.325 --> 20:38.525
(cell phone beeps)

20:38.550 --> 20:40.900
Unbelievable!

20:40.925 --> 20:43.970
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't apologize anymore.

20:43.995 --> 20:46.630
Just help me out here, because
I'm having a really hard time

20:46.655 --> 20:48.857
believing that this is
all about a video game.

20:48.913 --> 20:51.569
It's hard to explain.

20:53.942 --> 20:55.704
Try me.

20:57.104 --> 21:00.249
Kirsten, we can't keep
secrets from each other.

21:00.274 --> 21:01.408
I know.

21:01.451 --> 21:04.701
Well, then tell me. What
the hell is going on?

21:10.319 --> 21:14.629
- Liam, wait.
- No, I'm walking out this time.

21:26.016 --> 21:27.920
You had Liam followed.

21:27.945 --> 21:30.446
I have to call you back.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.993
And don't tell me you didn't or you
don't know what I'm talking about

21:33.018 --> 21:35.126
or how, "oh, I need to trust you."

21:35.151 --> 21:37.951
Okay, I won't.

21:37.975 --> 21:43.051
Sit. Please.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.643
Stop digging around and looking for dirt.

21:51.668 --> 21:54.871
- Liam is honest and loyal.
- Let's say you're right.

21:54.905 --> 21:58.741
He's a bona fide boy
scout worthy of your trust.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.001
Can he say the same about you?

22:00.026 --> 22:02.326
What are you talking about?

22:02.350 --> 22:04.890
Were you with him when
the stitch chime went off?

22:04.915 --> 22:07.717
What excuses did you make?

22:07.751 --> 22:11.204
The fact of the matter is you're the
dishonest one in the relationship.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.338
You lie and you keep secrets from him.

22:13.363 --> 22:16.438
And Liam is gonna start
to sense your deception.

22:17.538 --> 22:18.538
(gasps)

22:18.563 --> 22:20.530
He already has.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.908
The closest to us always do.

22:22.933 --> 22:26.549
And let me tell you, once that
seed of suspicion is planted,

22:26.574 --> 22:29.150
it grows until it drives
a wedge between you.

22:29.175 --> 22:30.816
It won't be that way with him.

22:30.841 --> 22:33.350
I hope you can make it. I really do.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.310
Honest relationships,

22:35.335 --> 22:38.924
they are tough even without the secrets.

22:38.949 --> 22:41.450
I couldn't even manage one with my own son.

22:41.475 --> 22:43.542
You have a kid?

22:43.567 --> 22:45.950
Ben.

22:46.425 --> 22:49.569
He grew up with a mother who
could never explain to him

22:49.594 --> 22:51.904
why she had to leave him so often

22:51.929 --> 22:53.963
or where she was really going.

22:53.997 --> 22:58.161
And he resents me for it to this day.

22:58.936 --> 23:01.837
- My favorite color is?
- Green.

23:01.872 --> 23:05.856
- And I am allergic to?
- Latex and fabric softener.

23:05.881 --> 23:09.369
- And we met?
- Oh, I know this.

23:09.394 --> 23:12.429
At a lecture on microscopic photography.

23:12.693 --> 23:14.560
Correct.

23:14.585 --> 23:17.620
And when I got to the lecture,
I noticed you right away,

23:17.654 --> 23:20.140
but you were too busy taking notes on?

23:21.788 --> 23:24.039
- Shutter speeds.
- Ah!

23:24.064 --> 23:27.340
Come on, it's in page
seven. Look at the footnotes.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.639
Do we really have to get this detailed?

23:29.664 --> 23:32.466
My parents need to believe
that we're a happy couple.

23:32.491 --> 23:36.013
Which reminds me, you can touch
my arm and smile from time to time,

23:36.038 --> 23:37.640
but don't do it too much.

23:37.674 --> 23:40.876
And do not bring up the
fact that we've had sex.

23:40.911 --> 23:44.237
That's the only part of this
relationship that's actually happened.

23:44.793 --> 23:46.222
(alarm blaring)

23:46.247 --> 23:49.883
We'll discuss table etiquette post-stitch.

23:51.503 --> 23:53.371
All right, everyone, time for round two.

23:53.396 --> 23:57.035
- Kirsten, remember, we need answers about Vanessa.
- Got it.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.421
Induce stitch
neurosync on my mark.

23:59.446 --> 24:04.121
Three, two, one. Mark.

24:07.670 --> 24:10.306
Vanessa's watching Mia and Hauser again.

24:10.331 --> 24:12.784
You were playing dress up
before I took a gamble on you.

24:12.809 --> 24:15.945
The minute you see a little success,
you want to renegotiate my percentage?

24:15.979 --> 24:17.350
Fair is fair.

24:17.375 --> 24:19.891
Damn straight. You knew
what you signed on for.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.550
Pay me what you owe.

24:32.896 --> 24:36.284
Greedy bastard. Karma's
gonna bite him in the ass.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.076
Vanessa saw a fire again.

24:38.224 --> 24:40.559
I think she's picking up on Mia's anger.

24:40.584 --> 24:43.386
Mia, don't mess with your karma.

24:43.411 --> 24:44.411
What?

24:44.436 --> 24:46.784
Be content with your own success.

24:57.799 --> 24:58.799
(scoffs)

24:58.824 --> 25:00.691
- Cameron?!
- What?

25:00.716 --> 25:03.618
- Are you okay?
- All good, Stretch. How about you?

25:03.643 --> 25:05.321
I'm fine.

25:05.346 --> 25:08.415
Sorry, I just thought I saw something.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.174
Whoa.

25:13.489 --> 25:17.114
- (music playing)
- (chattering)

25:17.115 --> 25:19.146
(laughing)

25:27.740 --> 25:31.572
- I'm at Mia's launch party.
- What? That hasn't happened yet.

25:33.080 --> 25:36.372
Which makes sense because
Vanessa's not here.

25:36.397 --> 25:39.905
That makes sense? Linus, what's going on?

25:39.930 --> 25:43.218
- (typing)
- Well, she's actually not in a memory.

25:43.243 --> 25:44.923
I can't find her anywhere on the map.

25:44.948 --> 25:46.448
Kirsten, something wonky's going on.

25:46.473 --> 25:48.722
You've concocted an image of what
you think Mia's party will look like.

25:48.747 --> 25:53.222
Right, because I really
want neon to come back.

25:55.859 --> 25:57.860
I see Mia and Hauser.

25:57.885 --> 26:00.460
Wherever you are, I'm
moving you out of there.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.687
(choking)

26:04.712 --> 26:07.335
It's Hauser. He's killing her.

26:07.384 --> 26:08.618
- Vanessa?
- No, Mia.

26:08.643 --> 26:10.120
How is that even possible?

26:10.145 --> 26:12.521
Kirsten is still missing in action.

26:12.546 --> 26:15.039
Amplify transcranial stimulation,
give Vanessa's memories a boost,

26:15.064 --> 26:16.665
put Kirsten back on track.

26:17.067 --> 26:19.120
Don't bother, I'm bouncing.

26:26.029 --> 26:28.129
I'm sorry. I wanted to see more of Vanessa,

26:28.154 --> 26:31.020
but she's just so wrapped up in Mia.

26:31.706 --> 26:33.900
I think Hauser's going to
kill her at the party later.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.761
Look, Hauser may be a dirtbag,
but his record is clean.

26:37.786 --> 26:39.332
There's no history of violence.

26:39.357 --> 26:40.532
Until tonight.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.226
(sighs) If you'll excuse me,

26:43.290 --> 26:45.861
I'm going to go find out
who killed Vanessa Sawyer.

26:45.886 --> 26:48.933
You know, the woman who
was actually murdered.

26:49.183 --> 26:52.233
Fisher needs evidence, not "premonitions."

26:52.258 --> 26:53.946
I don't choose what I see.

26:53.971 --> 26:55.869
That's exactly what you were doing.

26:55.894 --> 26:57.961
You extrapolated all of your
negative thoughts of Hauser

26:57.986 --> 27:00.470
and projected an image of him
killing Mia at the event tonight.

27:00.495 --> 27:03.660
Okay, you need to rationalize this,
because science can't explain it,

27:03.685 --> 27:06.687
but five or ten years ago,
would any of you have believed me

27:06.712 --> 27:09.445
if I said you'd be stitching my
consciousness into a dead person's memory?

27:09.470 --> 27:11.694
No, but I'd think it was pretty cool.

27:14.778 --> 27:17.095
I'll save Mia myself.

27:18.588 --> 27:21.861
Hey, Zoltar, hold up.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.772
I don't believe in psychics,

27:24.797 --> 27:26.911
but I do believe in you

27:26.936 --> 27:30.460
and if you think Mia's in
danger, I'm coming with you.

27:32.812 --> 27:37.516
Cameron, when I was in the stitch, I saw...

27:37.541 --> 27:38.818
What?

27:43.344 --> 27:46.661
Never mind. I'm going alone.

28:00.792 --> 28:03.994
Remember, when you meet them,
no handshakes and no hugs.

28:04.019 --> 28:07.149
Right, I'll just touch their feet. I
read online it's a Hindu sign of respect.

28:07.174 --> 28:10.829
- No, don't touch their feet. Please, that's so weird.
- I wouldn't touch their feet... Duh!

28:10.854 --> 28:14.441
And you know what? Don't laugh too loud
like you normally do and don't talk too much.

28:14.466 --> 28:17.045
- Be an active listener...
- Linus, you're completely throwing me off my game.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.670
Hey, Mom, Dad.

28:20.502 --> 28:22.503
Hello.

28:22.528 --> 28:25.370
You must be Camille.

28:26.945 --> 28:29.097
Welcome to our home.

28:31.056 --> 28:33.170
Oh! (laughing)

28:34.606 --> 28:36.170
Hi.

28:39.455 --> 28:42.434
You guys.

28:45.510 --> 28:47.940

28:47.965 --> 28:50.869
♪ I could see clear ♪

28:50.894 --> 28:54.895

29:17.034 --> 29:18.835
You shouldn't be here.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.454
Yeah, that's what the
guy at the door told me.

29:20.479 --> 29:21.771
Then I told him I was
a G.Q. model.

29:21.796 --> 29:22.896
And he believed you?

29:22.921 --> 29:25.776
I mean, with all this going on?

29:25.801 --> 29:26.931
I mean, why wouldn't he?

29:26.956 --> 29:30.276
Nah, I just showed him my invitation.

29:30.499 --> 29:32.675
Let's mingle.

29:35.435 --> 29:40.506
So in optogenetics, we monitor the
activities of neurons in living tissue.

29:40.531 --> 29:44.027
I'm sorry I can't even
speak 'cause this curry is...

29:44.052 --> 29:47.855
I mean, Mrs. Ahluwalia, you
have mad skills in the kitchen.

29:49.151 --> 29:52.626
Getti, please. Would you like some more?

29:52.651 --> 29:54.755
I mean, yes.

29:56.118 --> 29:59.156
You have chosen a fascinating

29:59.181 --> 30:01.481
subject to study.

30:01.788 --> 30:05.557
You know, Camille is a real whiz
at data retrieval systems, too,

30:05.582 --> 30:06.916
and acoustic wave theory.

30:06.941 --> 30:08.676
So she's very stupid.

30:08.710 --> 30:12.097
Yeah, almost as stupid as Linus.

30:13.254 --> 30:15.255
No, but seriously, I mean,

30:15.477 --> 30:19.246
Linus has an awesome mind.

30:19.271 --> 30:22.371
And he's not just
incredibly smart, he's kind

30:22.396 --> 30:24.397
and considerate

30:24.422 --> 30:27.896
and just so respectful of me.

30:27.921 --> 30:31.924
That's such a credit to
the two of you. Really.

30:31.949 --> 30:34.006
I love this girl.

30:35.713 --> 30:37.714
Oh!

30:37.739 --> 30:40.462
Not as much as I love you, darling.

30:40.487 --> 30:42.622
Shall we kiss and
embarrass our little Linus?

30:42.647 --> 30:45.923
No, no, no, please.

30:46.418 --> 30:48.552
Relax. They're adorable.

30:48.577 --> 30:51.312
Samir, help me clear the table.

30:51.337 --> 30:56.022
That is our signal to go into the kitchen
and talk about how much we like Camille.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.777
What are you doing? Are you
getting them to like you?

31:07.802 --> 31:09.516
I kind of thought that was the point.

31:09.541 --> 31:13.411
But they like you too much.
How am I supposed to dump you?

31:13.450 --> 31:15.316
I thought I was dumping you.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.715
That's so emasculating.

31:18.722 --> 31:21.758
Whatever. Just reel it in.

31:21.783 --> 31:23.715
Uh-huh.

31:23.740 --> 31:27.915
Check out these fashion-themed
hors d'oeuvres. Bowtie pasta.

31:27.991 --> 31:32.715
Gazpacho served in a tiny purse.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.401
Which makes sense since
it tastes like lint.

31:35.788 --> 31:37.622
I really wish you hadn't come.

31:37.647 --> 31:41.716
Oh, that's cute. Skirt steak.

31:41.741 --> 31:43.215
I get it.

31:43.355 --> 31:46.223
Look, you don't think I was
gonna let you do this alone.

31:46.248 --> 31:48.316
We're partners, aren't we?

31:49.660 --> 31:54.016
- Kirsten.
- Liam.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.911
You followed me here?

31:57.051 --> 32:00.954
I saw the invite, came to
apologize for walking out on you.

32:00.989 --> 32:02.990
Looks like you're doing
just fine without me.

32:03.024 --> 32:07.516
- There's nothing going on.
- Really?

32:07.541 --> 32:10.574
- You text her first thing in the mornings.
- To relay a message.

32:10.599 --> 32:11.699
We're colleagues.

32:11.724 --> 32:15.026
Right, at your video game company.

32:15.051 --> 32:16.505
Are you working now?

32:16.530 --> 32:20.705
- Liam, don't do this here.
- Fine. Let's go home.

32:24.647 --> 32:26.551
I can't leave yet.

32:26.576 --> 32:28.979
Of course you can't.

32:32.964 --> 32:34.991
(glass clinking)

32:35.814 --> 32:40.080
To Mia Nichols, who pursues fashion

32:40.105 --> 32:42.073
with a passion.

32:42.575 --> 32:46.444
When I first put her
online, I saw potential.

32:46.469 --> 32:48.503
A diamond in the rough.

32:48.528 --> 32:50.280
Well, I polished her.

32:50.305 --> 32:55.084
I put her in the right setting.
Now look how she sparkles today.

32:55.109 --> 32:59.880
The perfect example of what
I can do here at Dreamcatcher.

32:59.905 --> 33:03.508
- To our success.
- (applause)

33:06.599 --> 33:10.012
Thanks, Rick, for that lovely toast.

33:10.037 --> 33:12.831
I think you only used
the "I" word five times.

33:12.856 --> 33:14.685
(laughter)

33:15.556 --> 33:19.730
Tonight really is my dream come true.

33:19.755 --> 33:22.131
Thank you all so much for coming.

33:30.103 --> 33:33.532
That's a wrap. Crisis averted.

33:33.557 --> 33:36.232
Night's not over.

33:39.855 --> 33:41.812
Mmm.

33:41.886 --> 33:45.565
(speaks foreign language)

33:45.742 --> 33:47.799
You speak Hindi?

33:47.824 --> 33:49.458
(coughs) Reel it in.

33:49.602 --> 33:51.870
I just picked up a couple
of words from Linus.

33:53.309 --> 33:55.509
You learn from each other. Yes?

33:55.534 --> 33:58.511
Yeah, I think I've
taught him a thing or two.

33:58.536 --> 34:02.051
We're so delighted that
you have found each other.

34:02.076 --> 34:04.211
Yeah, me too.

34:04.236 --> 34:08.110
Camille, I want to show you something.

34:13.779 --> 34:16.447
- Ma.
- Don't "ma" me.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.554
Open it.

34:18.888 --> 34:20.956
Open.

34:29.338 --> 34:32.542
Holy cow. Oh, no offense.

34:32.567 --> 34:34.567
(laughing)

34:34.793 --> 34:37.661
It was Linus' great-grandmother's.

34:37.735 --> 34:39.789
Why are you showing her this?

34:39.813 --> 34:42.571
Girls like sparkly things.

34:42.596 --> 34:44.071
Would you like to try it on?

34:44.096 --> 34:47.969
- No, no, no, no.
- Hush.

34:49.290 --> 34:53.371
Let's see. It's just for fun.

34:54.668 --> 34:57.771
Well, you heard your mother.

35:01.532 --> 35:03.384
Put a ring on it.

35:33.637 --> 35:37.573
Okay, so I could be

35:37.598 --> 35:39.252
way off here.

35:39.277 --> 35:41.801
But maybe you don't want to go home

35:41.826 --> 35:43.760
because you're avoiding Liam.

35:43.785 --> 35:45.652
What, are you my therapist now?

35:45.677 --> 35:49.211
No, but debating your answer
ever since he proposed,

35:49.236 --> 35:51.911
not once have I heard you mention love.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.229
Do you love him?

36:06.229 --> 36:08.965
Why'd she come back?

36:21.256 --> 36:23.690
What's he doing back?

36:32.411 --> 36:34.713
- Okay, stay here.
- No way.

36:34.738 --> 36:36.188
Cameron, please...

36:36.213 --> 36:39.487
Okay, my sensitive heart.
I know. I'm coming with you.

36:41.816 --> 36:44.888
Okay, fine, but call Fisher.

36:53.456 --> 36:55.815
(Mia gagging)

37:01.866 --> 37:03.303
(gagging)

37:03.768 --> 37:06.302
- Ugh!
- Cameron! Cameron.

37:06.327 --> 37:08.982
I'm okay. I'm okay.

37:09.006 --> 37:10.544
He tried to kill me.

37:10.569 --> 37:12.403
You psycho bitch!

37:12.428 --> 37:15.575
- Keep away from her.
- I caught her pouring gasoline.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.436
Lucky I came back. She
would've torched the place.

37:19.461 --> 37:23.426
This was the biggest night of my
life, and I had to share it with him.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.106
So you were going to burn down the studio?

37:25.131 --> 37:28.067
That leech takes advantage of everyone.

37:28.092 --> 37:31.061
He has it coming.

37:31.086 --> 37:35.098
Greedy bastard. Karma's
gonna bite him in the ass.

37:36.010 --> 37:37.844
Vanessa knew you were up to something.

37:37.869 --> 37:40.937
She had a premonition.

37:40.972 --> 37:43.703
She saw fire.

37:44.415 --> 37:47.002
She tried to stop you, didn't she?

37:47.027 --> 37:50.603
You killed Vanessa.

37:59.822 --> 38:02.408
(gasping)

38:05.102 --> 38:07.698
Hey, hey, where's the fire?

38:12.879 --> 38:15.848
I hope she knows how to
accessorize an orange jumpsuit.

38:15.873 --> 38:17.007
Did she kill Vanessa?

38:17.041 --> 38:19.809
She claims they argued
over Vanessa's premonition.

38:19.844 --> 38:22.679
Vanessa was afraid that Mia
would set a fire at her party

38:22.713 --> 38:25.782
and hurt people, so she started
calling Hauser to cancel it.

38:25.816 --> 38:27.651
Which would have ruined
everything Mia's worked for,

38:27.685 --> 38:28.925
so she hit Vanessa in the head.

38:28.953 --> 38:31.721
She shoved her, at least
that's what she told us.

38:31.756 --> 38:34.410
That rock fell off the shelf, hit Vanessa,

38:34.435 --> 38:35.669
Mia panicked and left her...

38:35.694 --> 38:38.037
- It was an accident?
- That's for the jury to decide.

38:38.062 --> 38:40.764
Nice work, kid. Nailed it.

38:40.798 --> 38:44.110
Not me. Vanessa.

38:48.940 --> 38:50.774
Getti, thank you for tonight.

38:50.808 --> 38:53.710
You are welcome.

38:53.735 --> 38:55.509
You're always welcome.

39:00.851 --> 39:02.686
What's wrong, dear?

39:04.534 --> 39:07.336
I just never had anything like this.

39:07.558 --> 39:09.893
I kind of grew up on my own,

39:09.927 --> 39:12.355
so being here tonight with you and Samir,

39:12.380 --> 39:14.515
you're both just so warm and wonderful,

39:14.540 --> 39:17.509
and I've definitely never worn

39:17.534 --> 39:19.602
anything this beautiful.

39:21.971 --> 39:24.254
Thank you for letting me
have it for a little while.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.925
You're a lovely girl.

39:29.642 --> 39:31.754
Maybe someday?

39:31.779 --> 39:33.813
I don't know.

39:34.181 --> 39:36.898
We just want Linus to be happy.

39:37.415 --> 39:40.250
Me too.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.362
So is there a future?

39:46.897 --> 39:48.999
I never say never.

40:09.591 --> 40:12.250
You have every right to be angry.

40:12.510 --> 40:16.151
And you deserve the whole truth.

40:16.523 --> 40:18.754
But I can't give it to you right now.

40:18.905 --> 40:21.040
Is it him?

40:21.065 --> 40:24.868
Cameron? No, there's no one else.

40:24.893 --> 40:26.428
It's only been you.

40:27.432 --> 40:29.728
But I'm not enough.

40:31.570 --> 40:36.327
I am still figuring out who I am,
let alone who I want to become.

40:37.922 --> 40:40.791
I can't get married.

40:40.816 --> 40:42.928
I'm sorry.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.228
You're the most extraordinary
woman I've ever known.

40:47.896 --> 40:50.428
I think you always will be.

41:01.296 --> 41:04.164
You know, I said you didn't have to come.

41:04.189 --> 41:06.388
Doesn't mean I had to listen.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.997
So?

41:12.272 --> 41:14.504
You know me. I'm already over it.

41:18.422 --> 41:21.818
How crazy was it Vanessa's
premonition came true?

41:21.843 --> 41:24.003
I guess there's something to
this psychic thing after all.

41:24.028 --> 41:27.388
(gasps) You, a man of science.

41:27.413 --> 41:31.788
I'm gonna chalk it up to a yet-to-be-defined
time-energy correlation.

41:32.245 --> 41:34.380
Maybe science just needs
a while to catch up.

41:34.405 --> 41:36.288
Sounds reasonable.

41:36.313 --> 41:38.784
Now the real question is,

41:38.809 --> 41:42.288
what to do with this?

41:43.253 --> 41:46.153
My heart's still ticking.
So I guess it worked.

41:49.017 --> 41:52.717
Here. You take it.

41:54.072 --> 41:56.044
To protect your heart.

42:02.987 --> 42:05.315
(dialing)

42:06.745 --> 42:09.556
She said no.

42:09.947 --> 42:13.016
Yeah, that's right. She turned me down.

42:13.270 --> 42:15.556
Yeah, I can stick around.

42:15.581 --> 42:17.955
What's plan "B"?

42:21.998 --> 42:26.998
