<i>Previously on Smallville:</i>

00:02.960 --> 00:04.712
Tell me what you've done.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.953
<i>I warned you that the elements</i>
<i>could not fall into the hands of a human.</i>

00:09.120 --> 00:11.759
<i>The three must become one.</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:30.637
In approximately three hours, a meteor
shower is predicted to hit Smallville.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.914
And I want you to have this.
I somehow know that it's meant for you.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.390
Your curiosity always has a way
of landing you in precarious positions.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.788
Where is it?

00:39.960 --> 00:42.394
This is about you
getting your hands on that stone.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.232
I don't have the stone.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.713
<i>Who did this?</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.871
<i>You know more</i>
<i>than you're telling me, Chloe.</i>

00:49.040 --> 00:50.234
Now, who took the element?

00:50.400 --> 00:53.119
You're talking like we're never
gonna see each other again.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.713
I love you.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.354
I love you too.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.552
<i>And now, the season premiere</i>
<i>of</i> Smallville.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.230
<i>Kal-EI, you have traveled far.</i>

03:34.400 --> 03:39.110
<i>One journey has ended.</i>
<i>A new journey is about to begin.</i>

03:45.000 --> 03:47.594
<i>Welcome home, my son.</i>

05:02.320 --> 05:04.197
Please don't hurt me.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.672
Lie down on the ground.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.515
Open fire! Open fire!

06:22.640 --> 06:24.596
Where's the girl?

06:25.360 --> 06:26.918
She's irrelevant.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.389
We must find Kal-EI.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.111
Hush, Shelby.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.510
- Oh, my God.
- Martha?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.036
Martha? Sweetheart?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.792
Martha?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.234
Mr. Kent.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.754
Are you okay? Mrs. Kent?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.478
Clark?

07:26.760 --> 07:29.513
Clark wasn't in here.
He's all right. Martha?

07:30.440 --> 07:31.668
Mrs. Kent.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.029
Martha?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.593
Here! She's here.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.192
Sweetheart.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.595
It's okay. Easy, easy.

08:09.880 --> 08:14.476
- She's barely breathing.
- She... She's gonna be fine.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.753
Okay.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.909
We're gonna get you out of here.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.315
Can you help me get her out of here?

08:30.080 --> 08:32.957
Come on. Come on.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.158
Chloe?

08:45.840 --> 08:47.239
Chloe?

08:47.440 --> 08:49.670
Where'd you go, chloe?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.956
Where'd you go, chloe?

09:43.520 --> 09:47.229
Everything's under control here, officers.
I'm sure you're needed elsewhere.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.188
He has the key.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.548
Who are you?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.149
- Are you Kal-EI?
- Who wants to know?

10:15.080 --> 10:18.311
It's not him. Kal-El would not bleed.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.799
Clark?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.272
Clark!

11:07.360 --> 11:09.715
I thought Krypton was destroyed.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.154
<i>It was.</i>

11:11.320 --> 11:13.993
<i>But here in your Fortress of Solitude...</i>

11:14.160 --> 11:18.711
<i>... the geography of our planet</i>
<i>has been replicated for your training.</i>

11:19.640 --> 11:21.949
I know there's a lot
I can learn from you...

11:22.120 --> 11:24.031
...but I have to get home
where I'm needed.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.994
<i>The meteor shower</i>
<i>is only the precursor.</i>

11:28.200 --> 11:31.272
<i>A dark force from Krypton</i>
<i>has been awakened, Kal-EI...</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:34.512
<i>... and its sights are set on Earth.</i>

11:39.400 --> 11:41.550
What do you want me to do?

11:42.120 --> 11:45.590
<i>You must do as I tell you</i>
<i>and study with diligence...</i>

11:45.760 --> 11:49.594
<i>... for that is the only way</i>
<i>to save this planet.</i>

13:11.200 --> 13:12.997
Clark.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.358
Clark, I know you can hear me. Help.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.749
Clark, please help me.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.952
Chloe.

13:46.400 --> 13:51.030
<i>Kal-EI, you must continue</i>
<i>in your education.</i>

13:51.200 --> 13:53.316
<i>You cannot stop.</i>

13:53.680 --> 13:56.319
She's my friend. She needs help.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.917
<i>Your destiny is far greater</i>
<i>than saving one human life.</i>

14:01.080 --> 14:03.036
No, I won't let her die.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.550
<i>Each time you let</i>
<i>human-learned emotions guide you...</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:10.349
<i>... you put the fate</i>
<i>of the entire planet at risk.</i>

14:10.800 --> 14:15.112
- <i>That is your weakness, Kal-EI.</i>
- Please, I'm begging you.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.149
<i>Very well. Under one condition:</i>

14:23.320 --> 14:27.677
<i>You must return to me</i>
<i>before the yellow sun has set.</i>

14:28.480 --> 14:31.438
I'll be back. I promise.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.596
<i>Do not fail me, Kal-EI...</i>

14:33.760 --> 14:35.955
<i>... or the consequences will be grave.</i>

14:37.360 --> 14:39.271
You have my word.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.919
Hey.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.794
I think it's time you switch
into super-Clark mode now.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.359
Super Clark?

14:51.480 --> 14:53.869
I know you run
faster than a speeding bullet, Clark.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.428
Take me along for the ride.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.508
Go, Clark.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.029
- Lana, what happened?
- They're still out there.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.749
- They'll kill us if they find us.
- It's okay. You're safe now.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.434
Lana, you need to get off that leg.
I'll call a doctor.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.433
You don't understand.
We're not safe. No one's safe.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.876
- Don't touch me!
- Lana, you're in shock.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.712
It's over.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.958
The meteor shower stopped.
It's over.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.511
There's a man and a <i>woman...</i>

15:48.680 --> 15:50.910
...they're right behind us.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.517
- They came out of...
- Out of what?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.514
What did they come out of?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.636
A spaceship.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.030
- Where?
- Landers Field.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.273
After what you've been <i>through...</i>

16:10.440 --> 16:13.273
<i>...it's</i> normal for your mind
to play tricks on you. Trust me.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.194
No, Lex, you trust me.
I know what I saw.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.354
- We have to get as far away as possible.
- Lana.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.559
Thank you.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.631
I wonder who's more freaked out
right now.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.916
Me, knowing that I'm in a <i>hospital...</i>

16:50.080 --> 16:52.594
...where they get their medicine
via dogsled...

16:52.760 --> 16:56.435
...or you, finally finding out
I know your secret?

16:59.440 --> 17:03.353
- How long have you known?
- I guess I've always had my suspicions.

17:03.520 --> 17:08.150
The quick exits, the miraculous
recoveries, the lame excuses.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.790
But I think when I
saw you catch a car...

17:11.960 --> 17:13.790
...like it was a beach ball...

17:13.960 --> 17:17.191
...that kind of confirmed everything.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.233
Why didn't you say anything?

17:27.160 --> 17:30.835
I figured if you wanted to tell me you
were of the superpowered persuasion...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.070
...you would when you were ready.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.276
On your terms, not on mine.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.798
You're a good friend, chloe.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.868
Obviously not good enough.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.150
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.469
Clark, I don't blame you.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.839
Loose lips sink ships, and God knows
I've sunk my share of flotillas.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.437
What about Lana? Does she know?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.109
No.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.876
Well, I want you to know that I will
never be the iceberg to your <i>Titanic.</i>

18:15.040 --> 18:20.353
And your secret will never, ever
leave my lips. No matter what.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.674
I appreciate that.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.793
There are still a few blind spots, though.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.396
Like, how did we get beamed from
the Kiwatche cave to the North Pole?

18:33.600 --> 18:38.720
And what was really going on
in that 40-story igloo?

18:40.120 --> 18:43.317
Chloe, there's a lot of things about me
that even I don't understand.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.434
The meteor rocks...

18:51.200 --> 18:52.997
<i>...they</i> didn't make me who I am.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.397
So you're saying
you were born this way?

19:00.200 --> 19:02.270
I wasn't born
anywhere near Smallville.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.836
In fact, I wasn't born
anywhere near this galaxy.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.956
Okay.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.350
Okay, so that would then
make you, like, an...

19:18.520 --> 19:20.033
Yeah.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.476
But you... You look so...

19:28.800 --> 19:30.472
Human?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.191
I'm still the same person.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.558
Clark, I...

19:44.400 --> 19:46.755
I think you're so amazing.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.152
You save people's lives
and take zero credit for it.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.349
To me, you're more than just a hero.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.193
You're a superhero.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.871
- Chloe...
- I'm serious, clark.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.032
If more humans were like you,
the world would be a better place.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.556
<i>In what scientists are describing as</i>
<i>an incredibly rare astronomical event...</i>

20:26.720 --> 20:30.679
<i>... Smallville, Kansas was hit by</i>
<i>the second meteor shower in 16 years...</i>

20:31.240 --> 20:34.357
<i>... killing 23 people</i>
<i>and injuring scores of others.</i>

20:34.520 --> 20:37.353
They didn't get out.
My parents didn't get out.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.193
Smallville needs you
more than I do, Clark. Go.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.113
Go!

21:48.360 --> 21:50.237
Mr. Luthor?

21:54.240 --> 21:56.231
Mr. Luthor.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.798
Are you okay?

22:04.800 --> 22:08.076
The Disciples of Zod...

22:11.640 --> 22:13.232
...they must be stopped.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.830
You're talking about
the people from the ship.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.949
Their home is their only poison.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.791
Their home...

22:35.960 --> 22:38.155
...is their only poison.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.151
Where are they?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.475
- He's dropping EP.
- <i>Team to ICU, please.</i>

22:55.640 --> 22:57.631
- <i>Team to ICU.</i>
- Got it.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.028
Oh, Martha Kent, if you were trying
to scare me, you did one heck of a job.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.115
For a minute there
I thought I lost you.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.556
I guess I found my way back.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.993
Has Clark come home?

23:31.120 --> 23:34.351
Sweetheart, please, you need to use
all of your energy to get better...

23:34.560 --> 23:36.118
...not to worry about Clark.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.030
Our son can handle anything
that's thrown his way.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.428
Mrs. Kent.

23:49.280 --> 23:53.034
I have to say, you look a whole lot better
without a china cabinet on your back.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.158
Hi, Lois. It's good to see you.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.551
- Lois was quite a hero out there.
- You guys put a roof over my head.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.109
Least I could do is help
when it came crashing down.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.114
- Where is Kal-EI?
- Who are you?

24:29.240 --> 24:30.514
You know where he is.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.029
I'm sorry, I don't know
who you're talking about.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.839
Okay. Everyone needs to calm down
and count to 10, okay?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.230
So put the nice man down.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.077
Look, super freak,
you wanna find your Kal-El buddy...

24:51.240 --> 24:54.391
...you better start working
on your communication skills.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.796
I know where Kal-El is.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.910
He's hiding out at the Luthor mansion.
I can take you to him.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.832
Lana...

25:24.920 --> 25:27.992
Mom? Dad?

25:35.560 --> 25:36.993
Clark.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.915
- Thank God you're okay.
- Where's my mom and dad?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.117
At the hospital. Your mom
has a concussion and a broken leg...

25:46.320 --> 25:48.788
<i>...but</i> she's gonna be okay.
She's out of danger now.

25:48.960 --> 25:51.520
- What about Lana?
- Lana's safe.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.076
It's chloe I'm worried about.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.230
- Why?
- She was down in the cave with me...

26:00.400 --> 26:02.356
...when the meteors hit.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.720
I was knocked out,
and when I came to, she was gone.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.750
She must have escaped
while you were unconscious.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.629
Or someone helped her out.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.031
What, you think I did?

26:19.560 --> 26:21.869
- Lex, how could l...?
- Clark, before I passed out...

26:22.040 --> 26:25.510
...there was a light
brighter than anything I've ever seen.

26:27.400 --> 26:31.154
And I could have sworn I saw you
standing right in its epicenter.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.193
I was nowhere near those caves.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.756
If you weren't with your parents when
the meteors hit, where have you been?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.512
They insisted I get a head start.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.871
I got a ride on one of the military vans.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.032
Why do I get this feeling
you're being less than honest with me?

26:46.240 --> 26:48.800
- I have no idea.
- I'm beginning to get the <i>impression...</i>

26:48.960 --> 26:50.552
...that lying is a habit of yours.

26:50.720 --> 26:54.349
- I don't have to listen to this.
- Then be straight with me for once.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.710
If you're my <i>friend...</i>

27:01.440 --> 27:02.793
...just tell me the truth.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.556
Were you in the cave
when the meteors hit?

27:09.440 --> 27:10.919
No.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.596
Look, I understand that the police
have their hands full...

27:32.760 --> 27:35.149
...but Mr. And Mrs. Universe...

27:35.320 --> 27:37.959
- ...they're killing people.
- Lois.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.190
Clark. You're okay.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.759
Yeah. You?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.388
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Have you seen my parents?

27:44.560 --> 27:47.711
- They're gonna be fine.
- Where are they?

27:50.160 --> 27:53.232
Actually, we have another problem.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.277
Kind of a big problem, really.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.431
A happy, loving couple
came through here...

27:57.600 --> 28:00.353
...with superhuman powers
and a really bad attitude.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.959
It got pretty ugly.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.313
What'd they want?

28:04.480 --> 28:08.519
They were looking for some guy
named Kal-EI. You ever hear of him?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.356
Where'd they go?

28:19.200 --> 28:21.350
Kal-EI's in there.

28:28.760 --> 28:32.355
It's a trap. Get the door.
Seal it.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.356
Lying is their way.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.794
Not for long.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.959
I heard you're looking for me.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.111
I'm Kal-EI.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.199
At last.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.913
Who are you?

29:17.120 --> 29:19.111
The last survivors of Krypton.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.795
- What do you want?
- We want you to join us, Kal-EI.

29:24.960 --> 29:29.397
- And help us make this land our utopia.
- I saw what you did at the hospital.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.358
- It's not utopia, it's murder.
- The few must be sacrificed...

29:32.560 --> 29:33.879
...for the sake of the many.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.951
Then sacrifice me.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.273
Because I'm not gonna let you kill
anyone else.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.316
If that is your decision,
so be it, Kal-EI.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.271
We cannot destroy you, Kal-EI.

30:07.920 --> 30:12.198
But we can lock you in a place
where you will never be able to stop us.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.559
It is done.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.792
Clark.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.952
Are you okay?

31:31.120 --> 31:32.712
- Where are they?
- They're gone.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.391
Do you know who they were?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.955
We need to get you to a hospital.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.673
Oh, my God.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.236
Our home.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.600
It's just wood and plaster, Martha.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.598
Fact is, our family's still standing.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.673
We might be a little bruised,
but I think we're stronger for it.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.518
You're right.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.069
A house can always be rebuilt.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.393
It doesn't hurt to have
a one-man construction team as a son.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.518
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.674
Don't worry. Things are gonna
get back to normal soon.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.076
Actually, things will be a lot more
normal around here than you think.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.753
My abilities are gone.

33:19.200 --> 33:22.272
- How?
- Jor-El took them.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.149
But I'm not sure it's such a bad thing.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.270
All I've ever wanted was to be normal.
And now, finally...

33:30.600 --> 33:32.238
...I am.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.869
I don't think that this adjustment is
gonna be quite as easy as you do, Clark.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.755
But that's why I'm lucky
to have parents like you.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.956
Every time I woke up
and had a new ability...

33:43.120 --> 33:46.192
...you were there to help me adjust.
And this time's no different.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.791
It is different. You can get hurt now.
You're vulnerable.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.830
Isn't that what it means
to be human?

33:56.400 --> 34:00.188
No, I can't imagine Jor-El
giving up on you that easily.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.994
I took care of the danger
he warned me about.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.475
If losing my abilities is the consequence,
then I think he's done with me.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.478
Look, it's all in the past now.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.954
I'm ready to take a step to the future.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.670
Start by rebuilding this house
one board at a time.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.079
Clark?

34:57.640 --> 35:00.074
Now, how could Clark
possibly be here?

35:00.280 --> 35:02.999
We're in the middle of the Yukon.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.479
I don't know.
I must have been dreaming, I guess.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.954
What's going on, Lex?

35:11.800 --> 35:13.358
I came to take you home.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.877
Clark, really, you shouldn't have.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.951
- Actually, I didn't.
- Too sweet for words.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.917
How'd you get that frog
in your throat?

35:27.080 --> 35:30.868
That's what happens when you get a
neck massage from Barbie the Barbarian.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.834
Doctor says I shouldn't talk too much.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.479
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

35:35.640 --> 35:38.279
Don't get your hopes up, Smallville.
It's not permanent.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.432
I gotta catch a plane in two hours
for Geneva, and if I'm <i>late...</i>

35:41.600 --> 35:44.797
...the general will court-martial me.
- I did wanna say thank you.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.199
You were there for my parents.
It means a lot.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.034
I'm sure it does.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.354
But not enough to give me
this deluxe iris arrangement...

35:56.520 --> 35:58.112
...from Main Street Florist.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.233
She's down the hall, room 258.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.960
Hope irises are still
on your favorite-flowers list.

36:34.960 --> 36:39.033
Some things stay number one forever.
Thank you.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.078
Lana, before the meteor shower,
you came by the barn.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.753
You said some things.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.037
And three words sort of stood out.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.589
Clark, the sky was literally
about to fall down on us.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.671
I never knew if I'd ever see you again.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.479
Right.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.712
We were in the middle of a crisis.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.110
Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.952
Clark...

37:24.080 --> 37:26.514
...I meant every word.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.076
The question is...

37:41.960 --> 37:43.552
...did you?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.111
No more secrets.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.111
No more lies.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.916
Clark, I wanna ask you something.

38:12.200 --> 38:16.671
Do you believe in life
on other planets?

38:20.640 --> 38:23.393
Actually, I do.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.710
I saw something in that crater.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.593
It was a spaceship, Clark.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.799
It was unbelievable.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.071
