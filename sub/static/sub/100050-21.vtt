00:00.209 --> 00:02.252
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Maybe it's time

00:02.252 --> 00:04.671
to take a break
from your college classes.

00:04.671 --> 00:07.090
What? Why? I've
gotten straight As.

00:07.090 --> 00:10.010
I know you're smart enough
for college.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.679
I'm just not sure
you're mature enough.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.182
I hope you know you're
jeopardizing our relationship.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.600
I will take that risk.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.727
You know
I'll eventually wear you down.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.188
We'll see. I'm pretty tough.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.358
After everything that I've done
for you and your family.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.110
You give my grandson a job,
so I'm supposed to marry you?

00:27.110 --> 00:31.073
Well, you can forget
I even asked.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.578
Oh, no.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.038
You're fired.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.706
R-Really?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.541
Get out of my store.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.751
Now.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.589
ADULT SHELDON:
In every young man's life,

00:47.589 --> 00:50.926
there are milestones along
the road to independence.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.720
Squashing one's very first bug.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.055
Aah!

00:55.055 --> 00:56.890
Tending to one's own boo-boo.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.394
Not today, germs. Not today.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.938
(groaning)
And preparing a favorite meal

01:02.938 --> 01:04.940
without one's mommy.
(grunts)

01:04.940 --> 01:06.441
Can you open this?

01:06.441 --> 01:08.986
I'm making spaghetti
with hot dogs cut up in it.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.488
You know there's a lady
that does that for us, right?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.365
Yes, but she's
not here right now.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.409
That's why I'm watching Oprah.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.827
I would like to introduce each

01:16.827 --> 01:18.829
of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.706
Leonardo...

01:20.706 --> 01:22.249
ADULT SHELDON:
I was not alone

01:22.249 --> 01:23.834
in asserting my independence
that day.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.044
(Chariots of Fire theme
playing)

01:28.338 --> 01:32.259
This tiny slice of hot dog also

01:32.259 --> 01:34.886
seemed to yearn for freedom.

01:37.764 --> 01:41.685
But sometimes...

01:41.685 --> 01:42.936
freedom comes at a cost.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
In this case,

01:45.105 --> 01:48.817
a lowly disc
of processed meat...

01:52.779 --> 01:56.199
...would nearly
tear my family apart.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.119
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:59.119 --> 02:02.331
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:02.331 --> 02:04.791
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:04.791 --> 02:06.918
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:06.918 --> 02:11.131
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:14.801 --> 02:17.846
Ugh. Where the heck did it go?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.931
(TV playing in background)

02:24.978 --> 02:27.272
Do we have another flashlight?

02:27.272 --> 02:30.150
A slice of hot dog rolled
under the refrigerator.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.569
There's a flashlight
in Mom's nightstand.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.904
Totally, dude.
Totally.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.291
MISSY:
Find the flashlight?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.584
Yes.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.462
I also found this
letter from Caltech.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.381
I wonder why she was hiding it.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.924
So read it.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.926
I'm not allowed to.
It's not addressed to me.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.511
Who cares?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.596
The U.S. Postal Service
is a government agency.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.806
Mail is protected
by federal law.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.349
I'll read it.
Don't.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.393
If you do, I'll be an
accessory to the crime.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.687
Interesting.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.855
What does it say?

03:08.855 --> 03:09.981
No, don't tell me.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.901
Okay, tell me.
No, don't!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.487
Sheldon, if I tell you
but you never look at it,

03:15.487 --> 03:17.697
then you didn't break
the law, right?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.534
(phone ringing)

03:20.534 --> 03:21.785
Law offices
of Morris, Morris & Yorn.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.578
Janice speaking.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.082
Hello. I'd like to speak to
either Morris, Morris or Yorn.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.209
May I ask
what it is in regard to?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.002
Well, I was slicing a hot dog...

03:32.337 --> 03:33.755
What's up?

03:33.755 --> 03:37.217
I was wondering if you could
talk to Dale for me.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.885
Why?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.178
Wait a minute.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.596
He fired you?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.390
Yeah.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.684
After you gave him
the money back?

03:45.684 --> 03:47.227
He didn't tell you?

03:48.895 --> 03:52.065
We haven't exactly been
on speaking terms lately.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.358
Oh.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.901
I didn't know.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.822
But we're about to be
on yelling terms.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.907
This is exciting.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.868
So if I don't actually
look at the letter,

04:02.868 --> 04:04.244
legally I'm in the clear?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.580
Thank you.
This has been very helpful.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.999
And if in the future,
you have any physics questions,

04:08.999 --> 04:10.459
Janice has my info.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.960
Pizza time!

04:11.960 --> 04:14.463
Missy, you can legally tell me
what's in the letter.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.257
See...

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
here's where it gets fun.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.927
Come on!

04:20.927 --> 04:23.096
(phone ringing)

04:23.096 --> 04:24.556
Ballard's.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.849
What's wrong with you?!

04:25.849 --> 04:27.934
I'm sorry. Who is this?

04:27.934 --> 04:31.480
You know, you can be mad at me
all you want,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.690
but don't take it out
on my grandson.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.775
Well, he let the store
get robbed.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.819
And he paid you the money back.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.029
Like he should've.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.323
You know,

04:41.323 --> 04:43.825
I was actually starting
to feel bad for you,

04:43.825 --> 04:45.535
and now I don't.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.537
Yeah. Well, thanks for calling.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.873
(dial tone)

04:49.873 --> 04:51.458
(groans)

04:51.458 --> 04:52.542
Say cheese.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.628
Cheese.
(camera shutter clicks)

04:54.628 --> 04:57.339
Now tell me what
was in that letter.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.467
You're pretty cranky
for a princess rodeo clown.
Missy!

05:00.467 --> 05:02.427
Caltech wants you
to go to school there.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.971
Really?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.515
They want to talk
to Mom and Dad about it.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.810
I can't believe she
would hide that from me.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.562
Whatever. Put your nose back on.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.563
(camera shutter clicks)

05:13.563 --> 05:15.857
I'm home.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.651
Would you care
to explain this letter,

05:17.651 --> 05:20.820
which I didn't read but legally
know the contents of?

05:27.953 --> 05:28.954
Well?

05:28.954 --> 05:31.289
What were you doing,
going through my nightstand?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.916
You answer my question first.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.044
I am your mother, and I don't
need to answer anything.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.587
How could you not tell me

05:37.587 --> 05:39.548
that Caltech wants me
to go to school there?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.550
Because you're not going,
so it doesn't matter.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.134
So I don't get a say in this?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.220
Actually, no, which is why

05:45.220 --> 05:48.223
that letter is addressed to
the parents of Sheldon Cooper.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.767
So Dad was okay
hiding this from me?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.894
(sighs)
We are done having
this discussion.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.229
Go to your room.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.772
Ugh!

05:55.772 --> 05:58.066
Hey, what time
does Fotomat close?

05:58.066 --> 06:02.153
ADULT SHELDON:
I was angry at my mother
and needed more information.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.739
While she told me
to go to my room,

06:04.739 --> 06:06.491
she didn't say stay there.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.162
Boy howdy,
I do love a loophole.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.747
All right,
who's hotter--

06:12.747 --> 06:16.084
Cindy Crawford
or Jessica Rabbit?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.420
One's a person,
one's a cartoon.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.921
And you couldn't get
either one of 'em.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.257
Now answer the question.
Dad.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.967
What the hell are
you doing here?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.135
I need to talk to you.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.928
How'd you even find me?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.139
It's not like you come home
smelling like coffee.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.975
What do you want, Sheldon?

06:31.975 --> 06:33.351
I want to know
why no one told me

06:33.351 --> 06:35.604
about this recruitment letter
from Caltech.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.939
Let me see that.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.442
All right, let's
get me drunk.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.359
Hi, Mr. Givens.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.403
Aw, come on!

06:44.946 --> 06:46.531
Hey. What are you doing
with him?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.158
I thought you were in your room.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.035
Oh, don't worry. I was.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.411
I need to talk
to your mother.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.954
Go back to your room.
All right.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.956
And this time, stay there.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.291
SHELDON:
Aw.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.960
You want to tell me
about this?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.840
It came a couple of weeks ago,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.301
and since there's no way
he's going to California,

07:06.301 --> 07:08.803
I didn't see the point
in him knowing about it.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.805
And when were you gonna tell me?

07:10.805 --> 07:13.224
What difference does it make?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.769
This says to the "parents"
of Sheldon Cooper.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.145
Last I checked,
that was me, too.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.315
You are making a big deal
out of nothing.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.150
This could be
a huge opportunity for him.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.943
I should at least
be told about it.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.987
Okay, now you know.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.365
You think you get to make
these decisions all by yourself?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.575
In this case, yeah.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.993
Well, you don't.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.371
He's not just your son.
He's my son, too.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.875
He didn't feel like your son
when he had chicken pox,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.503
or every morning when
I have to make his lunch.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.713
Well, he felt like my son
when I took him to Caltech,

07:43.713 --> 07:46.508
where he clearly impressed
a lot of people.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.843
So you just want to
ship our baby boy off

07:48.843 --> 07:50.345
to California
to live by himself?

07:50.345 --> 07:53.723
I want to be included
in decisions about his future.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.850
If that means California,
maybe I'll go with him.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.602
He is not
going anywhere.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.021
You can go as far
away as you want.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.031
(insects trilling, dog barking)

08:16.663 --> 08:18.998
This is weird.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.042
I think it's nice.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.795
We don't usually get
to chat, just us.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.923
Yeah, I guess.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.176
How are things in school?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.262
Fine.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.098
Still having fun at baseball?

08:35.098 --> 08:37.684
Mm-hmm.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.146
So, any boys you like?

08:42.147 --> 08:43.690
Hey.
Thank God.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.066
MARY:
Where have you been?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.527
Trying to find a job,
but no one's hiring.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.112
I'm sorry.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.989
Grab a plate and sit with us.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.449
I ain't hungry.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.659
So, where were we?

08:54.659 --> 08:57.036
Oh. Boys.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.080
Georgie, come back.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.300
I should've
shown you the letter.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.135
Yeah, you should have.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.221
I was going to eventually.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.307
Sure you were.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.685
You should know...

09:20.685 --> 09:23.688
Caltech wasn't
the only school that sent one.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.693
Are you kidding me?!

09:28.693 --> 09:31.154
Well, one was in New Jersey

09:31.154 --> 09:33.448
and one was all the way
in Germany.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.034
Well, who says he can't go
to school in New Jersey?!

09:36.034 --> 09:38.411
I don't know. Maybe
we'll all move to New Jersey.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.955
We're not moving
to New Jersey, George.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.874
Well, I guess Mary has spoken.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.876
Don't start

09:44.876 --> 09:46.878
in with that.
Oh, yes,
Your Majesty.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.546
You know this is your fault.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.715
You're the one
who read the letter.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.175
You went in her nightstand.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.052
I was only looking
for a flashlight.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.179
It's not my fault
Mom was hiding things there.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.889
They're fighting
'cause you're a freak.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.225
That's your fault.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.269
You know
I'm right.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.313
GEORGE SR.: This isn't
about what's best for Sheldon,

10:05.313 --> 10:07.106
this is about
what's best for you.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.778
Where are you going?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.780
(knocking)
To sleep on the couch.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.448
(crying)

10:15.448 --> 10:16.908
Oh...

10:16.908 --> 10:19.619
baby, come here.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.914
I want Dad.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.295
Come on, let's get
you back in bed.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.429
(exhales)

10:45.645 --> 10:48.356
How did these schools
even hear about me?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.358
Well, if it's anything
like sports,

10:50.358 --> 10:52.485
there's always recruiters
looking for talent.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.404
I really enjoyed
visiting Caltech,

10:54.404 --> 10:56.447
but Princeton's
an interesting choice.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.324
Albert Einstein taught there.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.160
Buddy, it's nice all these
schools are interested, but...

11:01.160 --> 11:04.956
California and New Jersey
are really far away.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.375
Now you don't want me
to go to college either?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.210
I didn't say that.
I'm just saying,

11:09.210 --> 11:12.463
given how young you are,
we need to be realistic.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.215
I'll have you know
I recently took care

11:14.215 --> 11:15.758
of my own boo-boo.
And as grown-up

11:15.758 --> 11:17.302
as that makes you sound,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.095
I don't think it's
gonna convince your mother.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.889
What will convince her?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.932
I don't know, but I'm sure
between the two of us,

11:22.932 --> 11:24.225
we can come up with a plan.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.227
Well, you managed
to get her to marry you,

11:26.227 --> 11:28.730
so you do have
a track record.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.065
GEORGE SR.:
Okay,

11:31.065 --> 11:32.859
the "X" is you.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.485
College is the goal.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.863
What stands
between you and the goal line?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.115
Mom.
Exactly.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.200
She's a tough opponent,
so we got to be smart

11:41.200 --> 11:42.410
about how we get around her.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.620
Which won't be easy,

11:43.620 --> 11:46.581
because she's got Jesus
on her team.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.875
Boy howdy.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.922
BRENDA:
Oh, my God.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.925
You smoke?

11:56.925 --> 11:58.635
What? No.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.929
Then your face is on fire.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.221
(sighs)

12:02.221 --> 12:03.932
It's just the one.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.808
I'm going through a rough patch.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.518
What happened?

12:07.518 --> 12:10.396
The bookmark fall out of your
Bible, and you lost your place?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.023
No.
You run out of room

12:12.023 --> 12:15.443
on your fridge for Sheldon's
perfect report cards?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.326
Oh.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.495
(crying quietly)

12:25.495 --> 12:27.747
Oh, hey, um...

12:27.747 --> 12:29.958
I was just kidding around.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.460
I know.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.586
(sighs)

12:34.629 --> 12:37.006
Why don't you come over here?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.217
Really?

12:39.217 --> 12:40.843
And bring the pack.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.972
We'll go in the chicken coop,
where God can't see us.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.395
So, we agree that the only way
this is gonna happen right now

12:50.395 --> 12:51.813
is if you stay local.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.107
I can always go away
for grad school someday.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.818
And truth be told, I don't have
the emotional maturity

12:56.818 --> 12:58.695
to squish my own bugs.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.571
Anyway, that leaves us
with the big question:

13:00.571 --> 13:02.240
how do we get your mom on board

13:02.240 --> 13:03.825
with you going
where Sturgis teaches?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.327
Well, how did you get her
to agree to marry you?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.162
Oh, that won't work.
She doesn't drink anymore.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.998
♪ I changed the lock ♪

13:09.998 --> 13:11.457

13:14.377 --> 13:16.212

13:16.212 --> 13:18.798
honestly, I'm mad at me, too.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.592
Will you please
give yourself a break?

13:21.592 --> 13:24.095
All that you do
for that family...

13:24.095 --> 13:26.848
(chuckles) I am surprised
you didn't crack years ago.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.518
How do you handle it all?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.854
I'm sitting in a chicken coop
drinking a wine cooler

13:32.854 --> 13:35.440

13:42.071 --> 13:44.032
How can I prepare him?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.034
Mary, if that kid
is smart enough

13:46.034 --> 13:48.161
to have colleges
wanting him already,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.872
he's got to be smart enough

14:02.300 --> 14:04.052
On the other hand,

14:04.052 --> 14:07.180
I'm worried my Billy
will never be ready to leave.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.223
Oh, of course he will.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.641
Damn.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.310
Smoking, drinking, lying.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.353
You're covering
all the sins today.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.190
(chuckling)

14:17.190 --> 14:19.942
Mm. This is terrible.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.194
You ready?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.236
Yes.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.530
Okay, we're rolling.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.158
Hello, Mother.
I'd like to present my case

14:27.158 --> 14:30.244
as to why I should be allowed to
go to East Texas Tech next year.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.872
And I'll keep it simple
so you don't get confused.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.915
Stop.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.084
Something in my teeth?

14:36.084 --> 14:38.086
MARY:
I brought you a snack.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.337
Thanks.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.547
(sighs)

14:41.547 --> 14:44.509
So, I don't know if you
heard me and your father

14:44.509 --> 14:46.469
having a disagreement
last night...

14:46.469 --> 14:48.554
A "disagreement"?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.847
Fine. A spat.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.266
Okay, a fight.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.978
I just want you to know
that you do not need to worry.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.856
It's kind of hard not to.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.609
(sighs)

15:01.609 --> 15:04.529
Uh, sometimes moms
and dads have fights,

15:04.529 --> 15:07.865
but it doesn't mean that
they don't work things out.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.826
Did you work it out?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.369
(door opens)
SHELDON:
We're home.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.162
Eat your cookies.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.418
(sighs)
Why are you so late?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.170
Sheldon?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.840
I've put together a presentation
detailing the reasons

15:23.840 --> 15:25.716
why I should be allowed
to go to college,

15:25.716 --> 15:28.052
and I'd like you to watch it
with an open mind.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.932
I can do that.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.809
Excellent.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.686
Is Meemaw here?

15:36.686 --> 15:38.479
I smell cigarettes.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.860
Thank you for this opportunity
to plead my case.

15:43.860 --> 15:47.155
And I'd like to thank my
cameraman and driver, Dad.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.907
What, I'm not even, like,
assistant director?

15:49.907 --> 15:50.825
No.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.243
Sit back, enjoy.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.452
(sighs)

15:54.620 --> 15:56.998
Hello.
I'm Sheldon Cooper,

15:56.998 --> 16:00.084
and this is Why Sheldon Cooper
Should Go to College.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.338
I realize attending college
in another state or country

16:04.338 --> 16:06.507
is unrealistic at this time.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.593
Which is why I'm proposing
that I live at home

16:08.593 --> 16:10.511
but enroll full-time
to continue my studies

16:10.511 --> 16:12.972
with Dr. Sturgis
at East Texas Tech.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.934
I firmly believe that I'm ready
for this next step

16:16.934 --> 16:18.477
in my academic life.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.189
But don't just take it
from me...

16:21.189 --> 16:23.316
He's ready.
In the fall,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.109
now, just let him go.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.777
Please.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.739
I don't think I have anything
left to teach Sheldon.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.034
I'm pretty sure
he's already smarter than me.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.744
It's true.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.454
Honestly...

16:36.454 --> 16:39.457
teaching Sheldon is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.210
And I don't say that
because he can be a pain.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.545
I say that
because he's so intelligent,

16:44.545 --> 16:47.673
I had to study every night
just to keep up.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.177
I'm gonna miss him.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.805
A student like Sheldon
comes along...

16:54.805 --> 16:56.432
once in a lifetime.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.727
This school is not gonna be
the same without him.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.230
But I know
he's gonna do great things.

17:02.230 --> 17:06.859
And I'm honored to have been
a small part of it.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.070
I'll chip in for gas money.
I'll move him into his dorm.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.613
What-Whatever you need.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.032
Let's make it happen.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.492
Hi, Mary.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.079
I know this must be
a hard decision for you.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.623
I can't tell you
how to parent your child.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.750
I don't have children.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.293
But...

17:24.293 --> 17:26.504
I can tell you...

17:26.504 --> 17:29.423
that in all my years
in academia,

17:29.423 --> 17:30.883
I've never seen

17:30.883 --> 17:33.177
a mind like Sheldon's.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.807
He's truly extraordinary.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.976
And if you let him come here,

17:39.976 --> 17:43.104
I promise
we'll take good care of him.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.774
Sheldon Cooper,

17:46.774 --> 17:49.443
ready for college,
ready to change the world.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.195
GEORGE SR.:
Cut.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.656
If that doesn't convince her, I
don't know what her problem is.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.077
Well?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.578
(sighs)

17:59.578 --> 18:01.289
(sighs)

18:01.289 --> 18:03.624
Why don't you let me
and your mom talk.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.251
All right.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.342
Well?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.845
(takes deep breath)

18:25.771 --> 18:28.649
I guess our baby's going
to college.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.489
(sighs):
Oh.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.222
Whew. That was driving me crazy.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.476

19:05.895 --> 19:08.481

for getting me into college.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.155
You ready for this?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.449
