What's the cocaine sitch like
at that party?!

18:43.957 --> 18:45.957
Enough to kill a Belushi!

18:46.108 --> 18:47.516
But you probably don't want
to come!

18:47.535 --> 18:50.019
It's a real sausage fest
over here!

18:50.037 --> 18:51.462
I'm going to that (bleep) party.

18:51.614 --> 18:54.707
Elton, if you leave me
right now, it's a big deal,

18:54.859 --> 18:57.026
because this is the time of the
story where that's a big deal.

18:57.044 --> 19:00.379
What'd you say?! I couldn't hear
you over the sound of snorting!

19:00.531 --> 19:03.457
Have fun getting home
without a TripTik, trip dick!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.886
Whoa-ho! Looks like Elton
learned how to write!

19:07.038 --> 19:08.629
(snorting)

19:08.648 --> 19:11.607
♪

19:12.968 --> 19:14.635
How is he, Doctor?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.213
Well, looks like your husband's
gonna be all right, Mr., uh...

19:17.231 --> 19:19.382
I've been married three times!
I'm Bernie Taupin!

19:19.400 --> 19:20.383
You know what,
don't worry about it.

19:20.401 --> 19:21.642
I already forgot who you are.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.068
Anyway, congratulations.

19:23.221 --> 19:25.905
Elton will be back on his knees
in no time.

19:26.057 --> 19:27.890
Look at me. At some hospital

19:27.909 --> 19:29.650
next to a Denny's
by the airport.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.411
All day long,
it's just Denny's and the jets.

19:32.563 --> 19:34.622
Wait, what'd you just say?
Say that again.

19:35.658 --> 19:37.583
The important thing is
you're alive.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.753
Thanks. Hey, what do you say we
get the ole team back together

19:40.905 --> 19:44.240
for a "what do they look like
now" credits montage?

19:44.333 --> 19:47.167
Well, we can,
but I'm not sure you'll like it.
