01:12.072 --> 01:15.921
Good morning. Expect
airfares to gain altitude

01:15.945 --> 01:17.488
as crude oil prices rise.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.446
Analysts tell carriers
like Delta and American

01:19.470 --> 01:21.883
may be poised to
boost ticket prices

01:21.907 --> 01:23.668
while an analyst from
JP Morgan Chase says

01:23.692 --> 01:26.149
every sustained five dollar
increase on the price of crude

01:26.173 --> 01:29.282
translates to round trip
fares rising seven bucks.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.415
And, you know, nearly a
third of Carrier's budgets

01:31.439 --> 01:33.330
go towards fuel cost alone.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.419
But meanwhile, American
Airlines pulling its listings

01:35.443 --> 01:37.563
from the travel website
prevents the carrier trying to

01:37.587 --> 01:40.815
steer more bookings to
its own website, AA.com.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.166
The move is a big precedent
for the industry

01:43.190 --> 01:45.298
and phone bills will also go up.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.170
Yesterday, the FCC
approved regulations

01:47.194 --> 01:49.172
letting Telecom
service providers...

03:21.288 --> 03:23.266
Oh, all right, sir.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.268
I don't know.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.606
Your hands, they're dry.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.217
Yeah.

03:39.065 --> 03:40.065
Thanks.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.047
Still not sleeping?

03:48.532 --> 03:51.492
Thank you for the taste of home.

04:28.419 --> 04:29.419
Cole.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.029
Hey, Seyi, what's up?

04:31.053 --> 04:31.986
About that filing deadline.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.466
Well, we missed the deadline.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.686
Last I checked, you can't
exactly unscrew the pooch.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.340
If you allocated to one of...

04:37.364 --> 04:38.993
Hey, Seyi, it really is fucked.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.953
Listen, if we allocate it to one
of our foreign subsidiaries,

04:41.977 --> 04:43.607
move the settlement date,

04:43.631 --> 04:44.956
repatriate the securities later,

04:44.980 --> 04:46.914
get them in by year
end, it'd be like...

04:46.938 --> 04:48.786
Like it never happened?

04:48.810 --> 04:49.917
It could work.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.769
Let me look into it.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.536
And then, get this.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.451
You repatriate the securities,

05:01.475 --> 05:03.540
you do that before
the year is up and

05:03.564 --> 05:06.262
it's like it never happened.

05:24.039 --> 05:25.039
The answer is no.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.390
Yo, Seyi, Big Al
is taking flight.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.262
I need you on my wing,
man, Saturday night.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.742
Fly solo.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.221
Josie McGowan's gonna be there.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.685
You know she's toying
with you, Alex.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.401
Yeah, maybe, so what's
got you so wound up?

05:38.425 --> 05:40.881
This Cole fucking Whitman.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.211
Him again?

05:43.212 --> 05:44.494
Shit's not about you.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.060
You do know that, right?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.453
Right.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.716
Seyi, if I saw something,
I'd say, I got your back.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.540
Look, the problem is not
what you think, okay?

05:51.564 --> 05:57.158
Problem is, Cole Whitman is
a pilfering fucking dick.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.901
Dude, these ladies ain't
out of our reach.

06:00.925 --> 06:04.078
If you wanna get the
girls in the bed sheets,

06:04.102 --> 06:07.473
you gotta lay off
the spread sheets.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.084
Seyi Ogunde, you're
the man, okay?

06:10.108 --> 06:12.957
So, pretty please, this
weekend, let's roll out,

06:12.981 --> 06:14.959
like, Optimus fucking Prime.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.552
Autobots, roll out.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.816
That's a yes?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.035
That's a yes.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.419
We asked you to send
us your garlic recipes

07:23.443 --> 07:25.377
and you sure did.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.752
We handed them over
to a garlic farmer...

07:31.146 --> 07:34.410
Funmi, your forehead
is beautiful today.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.084
You're adopted, Seyi.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.566
I found your sorry ass covered
in shit on the GW Bridge.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.133
Wow.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.313
Did you cook something?

07:48.337 --> 07:49.967
Did you cook something?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.751
Why don't you ever
ask Seyi that?

07:51.775 --> 07:53.415
Because everyone knows
my cooking tells me

07:53.439 --> 07:54.624
I'm an excellent banker.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.409
Funmi, the boy I was
caring for last night

07:57.433 --> 07:58.673
did not sleep, please, not now.

07:58.697 --> 08:01.935
There's eba and egusi
in the fridge.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.763
But seriously, Mom,
he went to Harvard,

08:03.787 --> 08:05.286
he can learn how to cook.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.202
It's the 21st century in
Nigeria, too, you know.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.586
We shouldn't have
to do everything.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.078
- Come on.
- I'm over all this.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.756
Yappity-yap-yap.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.767
Did you hear him calling you?

08:30.553 --> 08:31.661
Shut up.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.880
Okay, I don't even wanna know.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.534
Dad's in his room calling you.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.448
Oh, God, something huge came up.

08:37.472 --> 08:39.669
Seyi, he's your
dad, too, you know.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.192
Oh, and I thought I'm spending
the little money I have

08:41.216 --> 08:43.410
on meds and therapy for
someone else's dad.

08:43.434 --> 08:46.240
I actually believe that.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.067
Seriously, Seyi.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.211
I don't think you understand

08:48.235 --> 08:51.550
how hard this stroke
has made things.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.271
Mom and I need you.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.381
And dad needs us if
he's gonna get well

08:56.405 --> 09:00.322
and travel to Nigeria,
so stop being selfish.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.083
Hello?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.413
I'm coming.

09:31.875 --> 09:32.963
Stay still.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.519
Seyi, I want to go home.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.389
Soon.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.695
How soon?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.559
Soon as your doctor says
you can go to Nigeria.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.585
I guarantee, they'll
put you on a plane.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.747
You put me on a plane.

09:57.771 --> 10:01.011
My own son would not
travel home with me.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.427
You're good.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.836
Oh, oh, Seyi.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.643
Yeah. Hi.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.905
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.255
- Hey.
- You look great. Josie, Seyi.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.301
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, how are you?

10:30.325 --> 10:31.650
- This is my friend, Liz.
- Hey.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.956
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.610
- Liz this is Alex.
- Hey.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.090
- Oh, hey. Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, Alex.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.397
- So, what's up?
- What's going on, Seyi?

10:39.421 --> 10:41.221
I'm not rolling all the
way to some fucking 58

10:41.245 --> 10:43.526
for some dude named Sven to
slam a door in my face though.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.642
Excuse me.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.230
I'm Lowell, hi.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.623
Seyi, how are you?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.059
- Rawle.
- Hey.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.643
You look like a guy
who knows what's up.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.498
Would you tell him that Lavo's
the place to be tonight?

10:53.522 --> 10:54.630
Oh, man, yeah.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.762
I go every now and
then, always dope.

10:56.786 --> 10:57.946
You guys should roll on over.

10:57.970 --> 10:59.156
Well, every now and again.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.027
Shit, who's your
man at the door?

11:01.051 --> 11:03.029
I wouldn't call him my
man, it's, you know,

11:03.053 --> 11:04.373
we're not exactly
tight like that.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.510
What's his name though?

11:05.534 --> 11:07.251
Can he get people in tonight?

11:07.275 --> 11:11.298
Uh, I'm blanking on his name.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.735
It's okay. Thanks, man.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.911
Sorry, guys. Bathroom this way?

11:14.935 --> 11:16.676
Yeah.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.438
Ogunde.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.918
Hey, Justin Gonzalez.

11:21.942 --> 11:25.182
Whoa, looking svelte, man.
Did you lose weight?

11:25.206 --> 11:27.314
A little. How are you living?

11:27.338 --> 11:30.274
Um, let's get a drink in
that hand first, huh?

11:30.298 --> 11:31.299
Come on.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.390
- Salute.
- Salute.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.352
Really though, how do
you keep in shape?

11:45.530 --> 11:46.812
Fuck, your goody two shoes.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.815
Jim Radass, man.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.905
Dude, how's life treating
you on the street?

11:52.929 --> 11:54.472
- Life?
- Mm-hm.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.734
What life?

11:55.758 --> 11:59.172
But seriously, you got
no big deals going down?

11:59.196 --> 12:02.785
Well, you got a
one-track mind, Ogunde.

12:02.809 --> 12:06.092
And it's on the wrong
fucking track.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.442
All right, I'll
tell you something,

12:08.466 --> 12:11.731
but then, can we
change the subject?

12:14.255 --> 12:16.320
I'm closing one now.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.911
Big fucking deal.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.414
LKN.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.198
They're gonna buy a tool company

12:25.222 --> 12:31.117
and we managed to get private,
serious upside value.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.292
Family managed?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.730
You know I can't name names.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.081
My advice, they go in at
higher than standard premium.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.126
Shit is gonna explode.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.127
Ka-ching!

12:41.151 --> 12:43.826
Yours truly is responsible.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.938
Hey.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.921
Now, on to real
fucking business.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.227
Mamacita'sbeen eyeing
me over there.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.840
You sure it's not the stink eye?

12:57.864 --> 13:00.277
I thought you said you
had a girlfriend.

13:00.301 --> 13:05.001
No, I said I had a girl
and she's my friend.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.722
It was good seeing you.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.052
Stay in touch.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.885
Looking for something?

13:42.909 --> 13:43.949
I just dropped an earring.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.714
It's totally under control.

13:47.739 --> 13:48.934
I don't mind helping.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.631
I said I got it.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.655
Ow!

13:53.745 --> 13:54.766
You're very hard-headed.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.028
I'd say the same for you.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.204
I said it was under control.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.710
I'm sorry, I just
thought I'd help.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.846
Um, wait, wait. Um, sorry,

14:07.759 --> 14:09.500
it looks like this.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.049
So, you and Alex,
you work together?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.877
Yeah, we're together.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.295
I mean, we work together.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.361
What do you do?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.624
I just finished two years
in Cameroon, Peace Corps.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.756
Starting med school at Columbia.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.367
Cameroon?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.940
Even picked up a little
West African pidgin.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.290
You're shitting on me.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.944
Oh, God.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.753
I'm on a fucking roll tonight.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.887
It's okay, I don't mind.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.891
Ah!

14:56.504 --> 14:57.873
Not so fast.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.700
A fee.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.615
Let me hear some
of this so-called

15:01.639 --> 15:04.227
African pidgin of yours first.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.924
Extortion.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.752
And you seem like a nice guy.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.494
I'm very crafty like that.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.322
There, oh, there they are.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.106
Yo, next up, Hookah Bar.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.847
You tried white gummy bear?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.936
Promised myself an early start.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.677
Oh, come on, man.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.138
Liz, you're coming, right?

15:23.900 --> 15:24.900
Thank you.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.250
Nice to meet you.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.262
Hey, Mom.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.829
Funmi says you need something.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.744
Just checking about that $400

16:26.768 --> 16:32.228
for your daddy's Lipitor and
Glucophage, it hasn't arrived.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.186
I can send it next week.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.405
How are you?

16:35.429 --> 16:36.710
Very busy.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.190
Okay.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.976
But remember, you put
it in God's hands

16:41.000 --> 16:44.109
and you will be the greatest.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.460
Seyi, say it back to me.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.896
I'll be the greatest.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.987
Good, I need to
get back to work.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.055
Bye.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.035
He preached enough for
10 sermons today.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.168
I was waiting for
Jesus to come himself

18:26.192 --> 18:27.952
and say Lent is over now.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.370
Shut your mouth so I can die.

18:41.990 --> 18:46.125
See how helpful you are
when you are with us?

18:48.736 --> 18:49.780
What?

18:51.086 --> 18:54.196
We both know what, Ma.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.763
I told you I can't do my job
and live in Hackensack.

18:56.787 --> 19:01.986
I was only saying it is
nice when you are with us.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.969
You thought about what I said?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.842
Yes.

19:10.105 --> 19:13.021
I even spoke to Father Emmanuel.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.786
- The answer is no.
- He...

19:19.810 --> 19:23.225
Dad cannot just get
away with this.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.468
You spoke about divorce before.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.820
You'd actually throw your
father in the street?

20:23.004 --> 20:24.242
Hey there.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.287
How are you?

20:25.311 --> 20:26.853
Not bad.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.377
Just sitting around.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.001
Hoping maybe I hear
that pidgin of yours.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.947
Maybe someday if you're lucky.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.166
How about this Friday?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.386
I don't know, something,
grab some dinner.

20:37.410 --> 20:41.979
Um, believe it or not,
I got study group.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.982
Saturday and it's a deal?

20:52.163 --> 20:53.924
It was about valuing all people.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.969
Now liberals care more
about macrobiotic dining

20:55.993 --> 20:58.711
and feeling better than others,
people our age, we epitomize this.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.452
Seyi, you're in finance.

21:00.476 --> 21:01.584
I'm as guilty as anyone.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.523
Self-hate and guilt,
you are a Catholic.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.023
Okay.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.111
Uh, can you take that back

21:07.135 --> 21:08.535
and bring me the
Barbaresco, please?

21:08.559 --> 21:10.375
And for you, miss?

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
That's fine for me.

21:15.321 --> 21:16.921
- The point is...
- Mmm! There's a point.

21:16.945 --> 21:19.428
We're all guilty and that
includes our former president.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.652
And my point is that he didn't
just give up his beliefs,

21:21.676 --> 21:23.127
what he faced was unprecedented.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.694
Bad, yeah. Unprecedented?

21:24.718 --> 21:29.133
Name the last president who
faced out-and-out racism?

21:29.157 --> 21:30.597
Well, maybe we should
walk this back.

21:30.621 --> 21:32.354
Maybe we should walk it forward.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.356
We can talk like
two adults here.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.381
Okay.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.665
I don't accept what
you just said.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.101
What don't you accept?

21:41.125 --> 21:43.005
That he's done something
no one has done before?

21:43.029 --> 21:43.800
I agree with that.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.504
That he worked in a
place where pretty much

21:45.528 --> 21:47.328
no one looks like him or
has ever taken orders

21:47.352 --> 21:49.303
from a person who
looks like him?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.242
Then, what don't you accept?

21:51.266 --> 21:52.765
That he can do better.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.829
That's how he got to where
he is in the first place,

21:54.853 --> 21:58.380
being better at school, better
marriage, better looking.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.598
It's the presidency.

21:59.622 --> 22:00.902
He should have known better than

22:00.926 --> 22:02.601
expect anything less
than what he's faced.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.516
He had to exceed expectations.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.909
It's the only way forward.

22:05.933 --> 22:09.110
And what if that's not enough?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.657
I grew up in Texas
outside of Houston.

22:14.681 --> 22:17.161
I'm sorry about that, Liz.

22:18.467 --> 22:23.361
I had well-meaning
parents who told me...

22:23.385 --> 22:26.103
They once said out
of love and concern

22:26.127 --> 22:29.522
that I should watch myself
around groups of black people.

22:32.176 --> 22:35.330
When I got to
Columbia for college,

22:35.354 --> 22:38.637
I found myself in a subway
car, everyone else was black,

22:38.661 --> 22:42.709
and I had a mini panic
attack, I was scared.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.471
I'd never been in a situation

22:46.495 --> 22:51.413
or a place where I was
the only person like me.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.568
I'm not saying it's
like that for Obama.

22:56.592 --> 23:01.728
I'm just asking how being better...
can remove that.

23:03.033 --> 23:06.646
That fear, the thing
that you don't know.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.392
Um...

23:14.915 --> 23:16.395
thank you...

23:20.268 --> 23:22.942
for being open enough
to share that.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.968
I really appreciate that.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.860
But, you know, you're right.

23:27.884 --> 23:31.298
It's probably not
the same for Obama.

23:31.322 --> 23:34.456
For one, I don't think he
rides the subway anymore.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.981
Thank you.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.404
So, you said your mom
works at a hospital.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.492
Is she a doctor?

23:50.516 --> 23:53.495
- Yeah.
- Your dad?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.845
I mean, he got private practice,

23:55.869 --> 23:57.237
you know, in the Short Hills.

23:57.261 --> 24:01.285
Two doctors, I'd have
guessed lawyers.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.766
You're very precise, verbally.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.618
I'll take precise.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.118
Let's move on to a toast.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.729
To you Liz, saving the
world in medicine.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.190
Me wrecking it in finance.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.630
Almost here.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.371
Cailin.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.786
Liz?! Oh, my gosh!

24:23.810 --> 24:26.310
You're back, how are you?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.051
I'm good, how are you?

24:28.075 --> 24:28.965
I'm good.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.445
Oh, this is Seyi. Sorry.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.576
This is my friend, Seyi.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.447
How are you?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.013
Hi, nice to meet you.

24:34.037 --> 24:35.537
And so, how's Greg?

24:35.561 --> 24:38.540
Oh, he's good. Really
good, actually. Yeah.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.934
Well, I have to get going,

24:41.958 --> 24:43.762
but we have a lot of
catching up to do.

24:43.786 --> 24:44.894
Yes, yes.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.789
Okay, bye.

24:47.550 --> 24:48.550
It's good to see you.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.855
Oh, it's good to see you.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.683
- He's cute.
- Have fun.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.380
Cailin and I graduated
the same year

24:53.404 --> 24:54.817
from Columbia undergrad.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.558
And who's Greg?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.385
He's my boyfriend.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.889
It's long distance,
but at least we're

24:59.913 --> 25:01.824
actually on the
same continent now.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.981
Uh...

25:09.595 --> 25:10.702
Are we splitting it?

25:10.726 --> 25:12.574
I think I'm gonna
hop to the subway.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.097
Okay.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.402
Hang again soon?

25:15.426 --> 25:16.969
Of course.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.387
It was a nice night.

26:22.972 --> 26:26.604
What are you... Wait,
how are you even here?

26:26.628 --> 26:28.195
By bus.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.043
Does Mom know where you are?

26:31.067 --> 26:34.264
Actually, I'm here to talk
to you about your mother.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.179
Now?

26:36.203 --> 26:38.529
You're here now ready
to talk about Mom?

26:38.553 --> 26:42.707
Yes, I want to travel
to Nigeria as a family.

26:42.731 --> 26:43.752
You are not being fair.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.276
This has been very hard on her.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.740
And you still haven't
given the money

26:47.764 --> 26:50.193
you say you were going to give.

26:50.217 --> 26:53.283
This must be some kind of joke.

26:53.307 --> 26:56.765
Who are you to say that anyone
has failed their duties?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.680
You failed.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.291
You're the disappointment,
it's you.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.685
You sat on your high horse
and you lived a lie.

27:03.709 --> 27:07.036
Because of that, you brought
a sickness into our family,

27:07.060 --> 27:08.931
into our family.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.867
You've ruined us.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.763
Are you fucking listening to me?

27:18.114 --> 27:19.986
You call me sick?

27:21.770 --> 27:24.860
You talk to me
like I am nothing.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.926
You think you're better than me

27:27.950 --> 27:29.996
because you grew up
here in America?

27:31.606 --> 27:33.715
Answer me.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.916
Look at me in the
face and tell me.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.749
You're such a fucking
embarrassment.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.631
It's Mom.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.352
Hey, Mom.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.465
He's here actually.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.859
He's fine.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.731
He just showed up.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.972
Oh, we're just having
a conversation.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.974
I know he gets cold easily, Mom.

28:15.998 --> 28:18.411
I'll make sure he
keeps his jacket on.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.545
Mom, he's not gonna
get pneumonia again.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.416
I'll bring him back.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.572
Okay, bye.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.338
Let's go.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.979
I'm trying to figure
out what is this.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.807
Yo bro, how are you living?

29:49.831 --> 29:50.852
Chill weekend.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.723
Got to meet a very fine bird.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.159
You fucked a bird?

29:54.183 --> 29:56.263
Okay, not only does that
sound difficult and painful,

29:56.287 --> 29:58.178
but also, I think your
mother would be, like,

29:58.202 --> 30:01.712
kind of disappointed
in you, wouldn't she?

30:04.715 --> 30:06.998
Jesus Christ. This is
fucking excellent.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.870
Yeah, I swear he's always high.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.481
Guy is like a fucking
asshole savant.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.527
I got to take this.

30:14.551 --> 30:15.857
No worries.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.314
Hey, Mom.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.578
I'm in the middle of something.

30:19.602 --> 30:21.012
When are you not?

30:21.036 --> 30:23.014
Where is the money for
your daddy's Lipitor?

30:23.038 --> 30:24.581
Something came up,
I had to use it.

30:24.605 --> 30:28.304
Seyi, we have talked about this.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.972
Hey, check out DealBook, now.

30:48.847 --> 30:53.001
Oh, Jesus. Layoffs have
already started on our floor.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.698
Better bust out the
A-game or we're next.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.134
I was actually just
headed your way,

30:56.158 --> 30:57.614
I need some help.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.964
You still got that pal at LKN?

30:59.988 --> 31:01.270
Well...

31:01.294 --> 31:02.793
I assume that's a yes.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.361
Can you get me info on a
company GeoPak, pak with a K?

31:05.385 --> 31:07.929
- What for?
- Verifying some research.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.539
Is this coming from Cole?

31:09.563 --> 31:10.869
It's for me.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.326
Oh, that's right.

31:14.350 --> 31:16.589
End his thieving ways.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.635
Now, watch Cole
Whitman get fucked?

31:18.659 --> 31:19.941
Yeah, I'll pay for that.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.619
- Pak, K?
- Thanks, man.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.964
I need some advice.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.618
Don't buy Mexican food
from Vietnamese people.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.817
Seriously.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.409
Wait, are you...?

31:53.433 --> 31:55.759
That's what I'm trying to avoid.

31:55.783 --> 31:59.894
Got a plan, but...
it's questionable.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.678
You mean wrong?

32:01.702 --> 32:03.723
Not if you're smart about it.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.359
The thing is, I'm very smart.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.992
And I got people
depending on me.

32:11.016 --> 32:15.213
These people, what would
they have you to do?

32:15.237 --> 32:18.762
Yeah, follow that,
you won't go wrong.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.432
Because I'm looking right at it.

33:00.456 --> 33:03.000
Uh-huh, well get it done.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.417
Get it... Today!

33:07.550 --> 33:08.963
Sorry to bother, John.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.094
I wanted to show
you some numbers

33:10.118 --> 33:11.443
on a promising new trade idea.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.879
Now, you know you have
to run all your stuff

33:12.903 --> 33:14.185
through Cole first, right?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.009
Cole's out of the office,
it's time sensitive.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.295
Okay.

33:25.829 --> 33:28.591
Okay, so, these two I know.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.680
So, what is this GeoPak?

33:30.704 --> 33:34.118
I've tracked it awhile
now, it's very exciting.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.859
All right.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.625
I'll give them a closer look.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.969
Seyi.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.429
John left these for you.

34:01.735 --> 34:02.886
He okayed these trades?

34:02.910 --> 34:05.478
Yeah, they're good to go.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.850
Remember that thing
I had you check?

34:10.873 --> 34:12.069
Yeah?

34:12.092 --> 34:13.733
John wants us to really
lean on to GeoPak.

34:13.757 --> 34:15.377
You wanna put the
trade on for me?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.445
Do I?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.232
That's awesome.

34:27.674 --> 34:28.824
Hey.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.523
What's up?

34:31.547 --> 34:35.745
Just be a second, guys.
Sorry, I've got company.

34:35.768 --> 34:37.399
It'll be quick.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.402
I'm sorry to rush
off last night.

34:40.426 --> 34:43.492
Let me make it up to you, a
little restaurant, Bouley?

34:43.516 --> 34:47.800
Yeah, dinner's fine, but
maybe somewhere less formal.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.063
Bouley's totally cool.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.152
Friday?

34:51.176 --> 34:53.850
Sure, I really got to go.

34:53.873 --> 34:55.460
Talk soon.

35:04.862 --> 35:05.862
Hi.

35:05.886 --> 35:06.974
Hey.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.865
Shall we?

35:08.889 --> 35:10.910
Yeah, but I was thinking maybe

35:10.934 --> 35:12.825
you're right about
something more casual.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.176
Well, what are you thinking?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.699
Wait and see.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.020
Liz.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.132
Liz.

37:46.850 --> 37:47.850
What's going on?

37:47.874 --> 37:49.155
You can go back inside.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.418
I need to leave though.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.289
What are you talking about?
Talk to me here.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.551
Well, talk about what, Seyi?

37:53.575 --> 37:54.683
My relationship?

37:54.707 --> 37:57.686
I just can't be doing this.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.321
Are you so sure about that?

38:01.583 --> 38:02.691
Stop.

38:02.715 --> 38:08.087
Liz, if you feel
something, it's okay.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.133
Listen, listen, listen, listen,

38:10.157 --> 38:13.073
I said I can't, I can't,
I got to go home, okay?

39:08.998 --> 39:12.611
You are doing your
Seyi thing again.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.746
Where are you in that
big Byzantine brain?

39:21.315 --> 39:25.426
Sometimes I wonder about my dad.

39:25.450 --> 39:30.213
He's always been so bottled
up even before his stroke.

39:30.237 --> 39:33.695
You said he was
caught in Biafra.

39:33.719 --> 39:37.046
My mom does, he won't
talk about it.

39:37.070 --> 39:41.703
Our secrets, they create
barriers between us.

39:41.727 --> 39:44.096
My father would always tell me

39:44.120 --> 39:46.708
the things we want to
hide can't stay hidden

39:46.732 --> 39:53.323
because they continue affecting
us and everyone around us.

39:53.347 --> 39:56.568
Our secrets have costs.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.266
How are you sir?

40:23.290 --> 40:26.424
I'm well, thank you.
How are you?

40:29.470 --> 40:30.491
You have insurance?

40:30.515 --> 40:31.559
No.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.017
Is this a refill?

40:35.041 --> 40:37.759
No, no, it's not.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.943
For something like this, maybe
you can come back during

40:39.967 --> 40:43.242
our regular hours so I can
confirm with your doctor.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.529
Thank you.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.046
Quite a run, folks.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.613
Quite a quarter.

41:05.637 --> 41:08.529
And while everyone's contributed
to an excellent few weeks,

41:08.553 --> 41:11.836
I'd like to single out
Seyi, whose tireless extra

41:11.860 --> 41:15.231
effort is a big reason
we're all here today.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.325
I know, I know.

41:22.349 --> 41:25.415
Things got a bit ugly
around here recently.

41:25.439 --> 41:28.374
But for you survivors, know
that the end of the year

41:28.398 --> 41:31.160
is bringing a little
something extra.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.941
Seyi, what couldn't wait?

41:49.724 --> 41:51.509
What's this about?

42:09.265 --> 42:10.528
Well, here.

42:13.356 --> 42:16.988
I don't know what happened
the other night, Liz.

42:17.012 --> 42:20.339
The truth is, it doesn't matter.

42:20.363 --> 42:21.732
I'm here because I
need you to know

42:21.756 --> 42:25.083
that I think that you're...
smart,

42:25.107 --> 42:29.305
and thoughtful, and hot, and...

42:29.329 --> 42:30.698
I need to know if I'm crazy

42:30.722 --> 42:33.962
or is there something
actually here.

42:33.986 --> 42:36.530
Sorry for the radio silence.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.706
It's just Greg and
I ended things

42:38.730 --> 42:42.560
and I just needed
some time before...

42:43.604 --> 42:45.824
taking that leap again.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.155
What do you wanna do today?

43:37.179 --> 43:38.679
I got to go play doctor.

43:38.703 --> 43:42.030
Well, you can play
doctor with me again.

43:42.054 --> 43:43.379
Oh, my God.

43:43.403 --> 43:45.511
Did I, did we last night?

43:45.535 --> 43:47.731
Hey, you know my name
means "God made this".

43:47.755 --> 43:50.932
Let's not hold that against God.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.091
Today is supposed
to be beautiful.

44:00.115 --> 44:01.353
Seyi, I should be learning

44:01.377 --> 44:03.834
major organ systems right now.

44:03.858 --> 44:08.471
But major organ systems
are so overrated.

45:00.785 --> 45:05.267
You wanna be a chrome
Seyi or a tonal Seyi?

45:11.360 --> 45:12.424
Everything okay?

45:12.448 --> 45:13.469
Everything's great.

45:13.493 --> 45:15.558
You got your secrets, don't you?

45:15.582 --> 45:17.429
Man of mystery.

45:17.453 --> 45:21.153
I'll pry your secrets
away eventually.

45:33.600 --> 45:38.146
I can't believe you
pulled this shit.

45:38.170 --> 45:39.843
Funmi, I had to
deal with someone.

45:39.867 --> 45:41.584
What does that even mean?

45:41.608 --> 45:43.412
Well, I had to deal with a girl.

45:43.436 --> 45:46.502
- A girl?
- Yes.

45:46.526 --> 45:49.113
That's why you missed
your father's birthday?

45:49.137 --> 45:50.245
I covered for you.

45:50.269 --> 45:53.291
I told Mom that you
actually care.

45:53.315 --> 45:56.686
After today, I'm not doing that.

45:56.710 --> 45:59.365
Yeah, I can't do this.

46:00.975 --> 46:03.214
I can't work the way I
work and play nurse.

46:03.238 --> 46:06.087
It's fucking bullshit.
You and mama need

46:06.111 --> 46:08.132
to start doing a better job of
keeping up your end of the bargain.

46:08.156 --> 46:09.307
Our end of the bargain?

46:09.331 --> 46:10.891
Exactly, your end of
the bargain, Funmi.

46:10.915 --> 46:12.963
I swear, there's
actually something

46:12.987 --> 46:15.163
wrong with you up there.

46:25.434 --> 46:27.151
Oh, yes, come.

46:27.175 --> 46:29.177
What's...?

46:31.397 --> 46:34.593
What's up, Mom?

46:34.617 --> 46:37.988
I was emailing your sister
to meet me in the kitchen.

46:38.012 --> 46:41.146
Listen, Mom, she's
down the hall.

46:44.889 --> 46:48.501
You couldn't do this
one thing for me.

46:51.504 --> 46:53.525
Mom, I always made myself clear.

46:53.549 --> 46:55.551
It was his birthday.

46:57.205 --> 46:59.227
I didn't come out of
solidarity with you.

46:59.251 --> 47:00.576
Oh, so you did this only for me?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.012
You can pretend what
he did doesn't matter,

47:02.036 --> 47:03.318
but I can't fucking do this.

47:03.342 --> 47:05.189
Do not use that word,
and do not let

47:05.213 --> 47:07.931
your sister find out
about your daddy.

47:07.955 --> 47:10.107
Seyi, listen, I do not
have to pretend because I

47:10.131 --> 47:14.459
turned to God, I turned to
him and found forgiveness.

47:14.483 --> 47:17.419
Seyi, this is not only
about your daddy,

47:17.443 --> 47:19.464
it is about your entire family

47:19.488 --> 47:22.163
sticking together,
no matter what.

47:22.187 --> 47:24.319
We stick together!

47:25.886 --> 47:27.995
Move past this.

47:28.019 --> 47:29.910
You mean sweep it under a rug.

47:29.934 --> 47:32.042
Look, I came here
to tell you that

47:32.066 --> 47:36.854
what happened yesterday
wasn't about you... okay?

47:39.987 --> 47:43.469
I always thought I
knew you, Seyi.

47:55.002 --> 47:56.110
Apex deal.

47:56.134 --> 47:59.200
John wants it on his
desk by next week.

47:59.224 --> 48:01.835
This is what more
responsibility looks like.

48:14.456 --> 48:16.913
I saw your firm in the
FINRA investor list.

48:16.937 --> 48:17.958
You exposed me.

48:17.982 --> 48:19.220
It can't be traced.

48:19.244 --> 48:20.438
You bought in volume.

48:20.462 --> 48:22.005
Alex bought in volume.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.920
Still breaks the Chinese wall.

48:23.944 --> 48:27.271
That's an insider deal, man.

48:27.295 --> 48:30.840
I made it look organic,
like our research.

48:30.864 --> 48:32.320
Organic?

48:32.344 --> 48:34.278
This ain't free-range
fucking chickens.

48:34.302 --> 48:36.237
This shit comes home with
a rooster we're fucked.

48:36.261 --> 48:39.022
That's plausible
deniability, trust me.

48:39.046 --> 48:41.372
Thing is I don't.

48:41.396 --> 48:46.749
Now I will check in again, but
know that this, it's over.

48:47.968 --> 48:50.599
And if shit ever hits the fan,

48:50.623 --> 48:52.407
you best do the right thing.

49:08.032 --> 49:10.749
So, what's the deal with onions?

49:10.773 --> 49:12.012
Onions?

49:12.036 --> 49:14.884
Yeah, you picked them
out at dinner again.

49:14.908 --> 49:18.496
Ogunde men aren't big on onions.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.673
So, you got it from
your dad then?

49:21.697 --> 49:25.223
You know, you don't
say much about him.

49:27.376 --> 49:28.376
Hey.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.117
Oh, are you gonna fight me?

49:30.141 --> 49:32.728
Ooh.

49:32.752 --> 49:35.581
Are you changing the subject?

49:42.370 --> 49:44.392
Now that we're done making war,

49:44.416 --> 49:47.723
let's go to the bed and make peace.
Okay?

49:51.292 --> 49:54.532
You were noisy this
time, grunting.

49:56.167 --> 49:59.537
Come on.

49:59.561 --> 50:04.151
Hey, are we just fucking or
is this, like, for real?

50:04.175 --> 50:06.283
That's a very feminist question.

50:06.307 --> 50:07.241
Thanks, Gloria Steinem.

50:07.265 --> 50:09.919
It's also an honest question.

50:12.096 --> 50:13.749
Liz, of course.

50:24.325 --> 50:26.521
So, it's looking as
if it's no longer

50:26.545 --> 50:30.742
a matter of if but when?

50:30.766 --> 50:32.206
And be sure the
doctor's cleared him?

50:32.230 --> 50:33.702
Uh-hmm.

50:33.726 --> 50:36.270
With the caveat that anything
can happen at any moment,

50:36.294 --> 50:39.229
so this is probably
our best window.

50:39.253 --> 50:40.709
And this may be the last time

50:40.733 --> 50:43.649
your daddy travels to Nigeria.

50:48.393 --> 50:50.197
I'm saying this now

50:50.221 --> 50:53.417
so everyone has clear notice

50:53.441 --> 50:56.053
and has time to prepare.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.381
Yeah, I can't go.

51:00.405 --> 51:01.686
Wait, what?

51:01.710 --> 51:03.230
I got a lot of things
going on at work.

51:03.254 --> 51:03.775
No.

51:03.799 --> 51:05.734
There's nothing to discuss.

51:05.758 --> 51:08.065
It's my answer, I can't go.

51:09.892 --> 51:11.894
You're full of shit.

51:22.818 --> 51:24.796
No...

51:34.590 --> 51:35.590
What's up?

51:35.614 --> 51:37.006
Nothing's up.

51:39.183 --> 51:41.378
Um... I'm asking because it
looks like something is up

51:41.402 --> 51:43.250
but you're not saying anything.

51:43.274 --> 51:47.341
I'm not saying anything
because nothing is up.

51:47.365 --> 51:49.169
Did everything go all
right with your family?

51:49.193 --> 51:52.868
Liz, everything is
fine with my family.

51:52.892 --> 51:57.481
You keep on asking me questions
about my family, my dad.

51:57.505 --> 51:58.395
What about your family?

51:58.419 --> 51:59.918
You don't talk about your dad.

51:59.942 --> 52:01.746
Well, I've never had my family
away from you, not at all.

52:01.770 --> 52:03.183
In fact, my mom's
coming into town

52:03.207 --> 52:05.315
and I was just about
to invite you.

52:05.339 --> 52:06.186
To what?

52:06.210 --> 52:08.927
Dinner, I guess.

52:08.951 --> 52:10.364
She's interested in meeting you.

52:10.388 --> 52:12.192
I told her about you, your work,

52:12.216 --> 52:14.150
your cool Nigerian
doctor parents,

52:14.174 --> 52:16.544
even how you hate onions.

52:16.568 --> 52:18.111
You said all of that?

52:18.135 --> 52:19.484
Uh, yeah.

52:22.617 --> 52:26.336
My mom can actually be
pretty open-minded.

52:27.579 --> 52:30.035
If you don't wanna
go, just say so.

52:30.059 --> 52:32.497
Liz, no, it's not
that, it's just...

52:34.281 --> 52:36.999
you make me feel like I
got to perform for her,

52:37.023 --> 52:39.219
you know, present some
version of myself.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.785
No, you don't.

52:40.809 --> 52:45.292
Just be the wonderful person I
said you were, be yourself.

53:54.405 --> 53:56.320
Seyi Ogunde.

54:01.281 --> 54:04.241
The very last
motherfucker I'd expect.

54:06.721 --> 54:09.898
Seriously, who here
doesn't cheat?

54:11.248 --> 54:14.009
Addy, it's for the kids, man.

54:14.033 --> 54:16.141
When you're ready to
graduate high school,

54:16.165 --> 54:18.211
you give me a ring.

54:35.924 --> 54:38.033
John needs to see you.

54:38.057 --> 54:39.469
Can't wait till tomorrow?

54:39.493 --> 54:42.017
He wants you in there now.

54:46.761 --> 54:49.111
So can you explain this?

54:51.679 --> 54:53.309
Look, I haven't done
anything wrong.

54:53.333 --> 54:56.660
When the SEC comes, and believe
me they will, nobody looks good.

54:56.684 --> 54:58.358
I followed GeoPak
for a while now.

54:58.382 --> 55:00.447
You don't cover that sector.

55:00.471 --> 55:02.311
Don't you think it's odd
our healthcare analyst

55:02.335 --> 55:04.451
suddenly knows all
about industrials?

55:04.475 --> 55:06.017
I got a scent, I followed it.

55:06.041 --> 55:07.976
So where'd you catch the whiff?

55:08.000 --> 55:09.978
I'm on your side, Seyi,

55:10.002 --> 55:13.658
but you need to get your
story straight, fast.

55:22.275 --> 55:23.905
He's never late.

55:28.803 --> 55:30.259
Where are you?

55:30.283 --> 55:31.565
Something massive came up.

55:31.589 --> 55:33.306
When are you getting here?

55:33.330 --> 55:35.046
I got to stay here,
this is important.

55:35.070 --> 55:37.397
I kind of feel that
way about my mom.

55:37.421 --> 55:39.268
Liz, look, I'm sorry, okay?

55:39.292 --> 55:41.009
I'll make it up to you.

55:41.033 --> 55:42.706
It's okay, don't
worry, all right?

55:42.730 --> 55:44.665
I understand.

55:44.689 --> 55:46.797
Thank you.

55:46.821 --> 55:48.886
I'll come over later at 11:00?

55:48.910 --> 55:50.564
I'll be waiting.

55:51.870 --> 55:53.219
See you.

56:10.105 --> 56:11.648
Hey, can you open the door?

56:11.672 --> 56:13.892
Hold on, man.

56:15.281 --> 56:17.001
Hey, please, can you,
can you open the door?

56:17.025 --> 56:18.351
Yo, yo, it ain't working, man,

56:18.375 --> 56:20.309
that's why I pulled off
for a second, all right?

56:20.333 --> 56:22.746
- All right.
- Hold on.

56:22.770 --> 56:23.878
Open the door.

56:23.902 --> 56:26.054
Hey, you're gonna break it, man.

56:26.078 --> 56:27.272
Come on, open the door.

56:27.296 --> 56:28.883
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

56:28.907 --> 56:30.363
Hey, shut the fuck up, man.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.975
- Open the fucking door!
- Fuck you!

57:18.957 --> 57:20.369
Hello?

57:20.393 --> 57:23.503
Hey, Matt, it's Seyi Ogunde.

57:23.527 --> 57:27.115
Seyi! To what do I
owe the pleasure?

57:27.139 --> 57:30.727
I was wondering if you can
hook me up with something.

57:30.751 --> 57:32.163
Of course.

57:32.187 --> 57:33.774
Anything for a friend.

57:33.798 --> 57:35.428
So, how do we do this?

57:35.452 --> 57:37.125
Why don't you just come on over?

57:37.149 --> 57:38.829
No, it's pretty late,
I don't wanna impose.

57:38.853 --> 57:40.563
No, no, no, no. I insist.

57:40.587 --> 57:44.069
The truth is, I could
use your help.

57:50.162 --> 57:52.164
Where am I heading?

57:59.606 --> 58:00.825
Come on.

58:05.960 --> 58:09.244
Robin, Erica, this is Seyi.

58:09.268 --> 58:11.376
- Seyi's the man.
- Hey, Seyi.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.249
You gotta check this out.

58:14.273 --> 58:16.469
It's a levitating speaker.

58:16.493 --> 58:20.192
Is this shit on some
next level or what?

58:32.596 --> 58:34.946
- Seyi.
- Robin.

58:36.251 --> 58:38.360
So what kind of name is that?

58:38.384 --> 58:40.144
Seyi?

58:40.168 --> 58:41.668
Nigerian.

58:41.692 --> 58:44.018
I grew up in South Africa.

58:44.042 --> 58:45.193
Really?

58:45.217 --> 58:46.455
How come?

58:46.479 --> 58:49.656
My dad works for the CIA.

58:52.659 --> 58:55.377
You wanna hear something funny?

58:55.401 --> 58:58.032
It's so nice to meet you, Seyi.

59:00.449 --> 59:02.234
See, I told you it was funny.

59:03.061 --> 59:05.759
Wanna fix us some drinks?

59:12.636 --> 59:16.137
So this party was insane, like,
straight up Caligula shit,

59:16.161 --> 59:17.834
and I'm like, "It's my boss!"

59:17.858 --> 59:20.184
How am I gonna look him
in the eye on Monday?

59:20.208 --> 59:22.578
Lifestyles of the
rich and pervy.

59:22.602 --> 59:23.777
Exactamundo.

01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:40.854
Shit.

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:46.880
You've more than earned this.

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:49.186
Provigil.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.647
Shit will keep you going strong.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:55.477
It's like Viagra for
your other head.

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.354
What are you doing here, Seyi?

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:27.355
I came to see you.

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.139
You mean to ply me with gifts?

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:31.185
You can't just show
up with flowers

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:34.212
and expect to get what you want.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:45.460
Look, I know I've not
been myself lately,

01:01:45.484 --> 01:01:46.940
but I can do better,
Liz, I promise.

01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:49.029
Where were you? I
went to your place.

01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:50.291
I was at the office.

01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:52.534
I called your office.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.515
I don't wanna see you now.

01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:58.908
I understand what happened...

01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:02.414
Do you understand what happened?

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:04.914
I need to be alone tonight.

01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:07.027
- Liz, if you just...
- Please, Seyi.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.246
Good morning.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:34.639
Nancy Shepherd, Securities
and Exchange Commission.

01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:37.449
We're headed to the 24th floor.

01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:32.259
Mama.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.221
How is he?

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:40.983
Tell me.

01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:42.922
He's not speaking.

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:11.081
I cannot continue like this.

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:22.179
After what you have
done, after everything,

01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:28.576
you expect me to just
take care of you?

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:36.541
I'm not gonna, cannot
continue like this.

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:42.939
You made me lie.

01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:48.398
All of us, you
made us all liars.

01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:51.077
I tried to protect
this family, but...

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:55.255
I cannot go on this way

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:59.390
because I am a good mother.

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:03.326
Mom.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:05.067
I am a good mother, you hear me?

01:06:05.091 --> 01:06:08.138
Mom, how the fuck can you?

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.944
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.641
- Funmi, stay calm.
- Not now, Seyi!

01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:16.668
- Calm.
- It's true, Funmi.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:19.845
I am a good mother.

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:22.326
Really?

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:25.218
You are being a good
mother right now.

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.350
- You...
- I said stop it!

01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:31.006
If you only knew what he did.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:32.790
Mom, please, not now.

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:33.922
What did he do?

01:06:33.946 --> 01:06:36.731
Another time, Mom, please.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.778
That summer...

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:44.000
Aunty Aubeo came.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:51.181
Remember?

01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:55.924
I was vomiting, hmm?

01:06:57.013 --> 01:07:00.059
And my urine... was black...

01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:04.281
and my abdomen pained me,

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.893
pained me like fire, hmm?

01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:12.787
I went to the doctor.

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:16.138
He said, "Do you know
that you have a disease?"

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:19.035
"A disease?" I said.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.911
"Hepatitis," he told me.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.500
That is when I knew for certain

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:33.136
your father had been unfaithful.

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:39.011
I cried so much on the way
home, I couldn't see the road.

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.251
I had to pull over
because I was afraid

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:46.149
I was going to kill
myself or someone else.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:52.372
But also because I knew I
could not confront him.

01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:55.201
Not after that.

01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:03.601
You kept this from me?

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:10.651
Wow.

01:08:22.533 --> 01:08:24.361
Not anymore.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.975
Seyi, hey, what's up?
Where have you been?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.456
Family stuff.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.981
Is everything okay? Dude,
these investigators,

01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:03.506
they've been wanting to talk to you,
but they're crafty motherfuckers.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:06.553
So, just you be careful, okay?

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:08.318
Okay, peace, bro.

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:13.515
We're not here to question you, Mr.
Ogunde.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.736
The truth is, we need your help.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.130
At this point, we know
that Alex Mueller

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.219
made these big
purchases of GeoPak.

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:23.046
And we also know about
his friend at LKN,

01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:25.310
the private equity
side of the deal.

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:26.921
We could subpoena his email,

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:31.099
open up a formal investigation,
but we'd like to avoid that.

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:33.319
What do you want?

01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:34.971
An admission.

01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:36.538
People say you're friends.

01:09:36.563 --> 01:09:38.541
I mean, maybe you
heard something.

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:41.587
Maybe you could convince
him to come forward.

01:09:41.612 --> 01:09:43.981
I haven't heard a thing.

01:09:44.005 --> 01:09:46.810
I notice you're not exactly
defending him here.

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:50.011
Do you think Mr.
Mueller capable?

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:53.189
Mr. Ogunde?

01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:58.194
Will you help us?

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:42.692
Are you sure you're okay?

01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:44.128
Yeah.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:48.481
Okay, well, my feelings
are what they are,

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:51.614
but I got some questions first.

01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:53.703
Fire away.

01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:57.272
Why do you keep things from me?

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.708
You know that's not true.

01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:00.332
I know you've been
honest about your job,

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.322
school, but other things.

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:04.323
You know what you sound like?

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.747
Tell me the truth
about your family.

01:11:05.771 --> 01:11:08.544
You sound like someone crazy.

01:11:08.568 --> 01:11:11.199
What is this? I'm
not some bad guy.

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.897
Fine, but who are you?

01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:17.466
No, this conversation is over.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.903
No, Seyi, please.
Please, just talk.

01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:20.991
It's time you left.

01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:23.820
Just please just
talk to me for once.

01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:25.411
Be open.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.153
Please?

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:30.808
Just try.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.598
I slept with someone.

01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:50.480
Go fuck yourself!

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:10.780
Focus, focus, focus.

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:52.368
Hey. Hey!

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:55.825
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

01:12:55.849 --> 01:12:56.957
I don't want any trouble.

01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:58.741
Trouble? I'm not
robbing you, I just...

01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:00.917
I went to fucking Harvard.

01:13:00.941 --> 01:13:02.397
Look, you clutched your bag
and I was just saying...

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:04.573
- I said, stop.
- Just look at me and listen to me.

01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:05.531
I swear, if you don't.

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:07.010
Hey, don't treat me like that.

01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:09.361
Clutch your bag, you know me, huh?
You know my IQ?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.711
I'm at the top. Off the charts.

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:13.147
I graduated with honors.

01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:15.131
You know what my father
accomplished from nothing?

01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:17.635
You can't outdo me. Don't look at
me like you're better than me.

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.066
Help, help me!

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.962
Hey, hey, stop right there!

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.471
Stop right there!

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:13.294
What do you wanna do?

01:14:52.705 --> 01:14:53.750
Hello?

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:57.493
Please, I need help.

01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:59.625
Please.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.524
Hey.

01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:10.548
Hey.

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.492
What happened?

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.364
You don't remember?

01:15:23.388 --> 01:15:26.130
I remember running
from the police and...

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.350
Just running.

01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:33.287
You called me asking for help.

01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:35.269
You came.

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:42.296
It's not like that, Seyi.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.863
Liz, please you know I.

01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:46.082
You got other visitors,
your mom and your sister.

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:48.935
They're very nice people.

01:15:55.246 --> 01:15:57.683
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:11.871
Are you okay?

01:16:15.222 --> 01:16:16.572
Yeah.

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:23.143
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:53.260
Do you need anything?

01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:20.287
You talked about...
forgiving Dad.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:26.424
How?

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:34.214
I couldn't forgive your father.

01:17:36.303 --> 01:17:40.525
But, I couldn't hate him either.

01:17:42.962 --> 01:17:46.487
I struggled with forgiveness,
Seyi, every day.

01:17:53.581 --> 01:17:56.343
What he did was terrible.

01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:59.979
Uh-hmm, but what I
did was wrong, too.

01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:04.786
If you really want
things to change,

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:07.857
you have to be willing to
look at the truth and...

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:11.556
I turned a blind eye.

01:18:13.253 --> 01:18:17.451
Understand I never wanted
to hurt you or your sister.

01:18:17.475 --> 01:18:20.454
A mother, a parent,

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:24.134
never wants to hurt their
child, it's unnatural.

01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:30.357
All of us, we've
all made mistakes.

01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:36.035
You'll appreciate this later.

01:18:36.059 --> 01:18:40.256
A person is not only the
worst thing they have done

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.065
or the best thing.

01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:48.898
Your father and I
still share a love.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:57.907
It helps us try to
accept and forgive.

01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:04.348
Do you have that love for him?

01:19:06.393 --> 01:19:09.764
- Do you love him?
- Come on.

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:10.809
It's a simple question.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:13.768
It's a manipulative question.

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.248
Oh, no, Seyi.

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:17.274
Please stop. No.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.192
Do you love your daddy?

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:50.326
For today's volume, or more
precisely the lack of it,

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.415
it is one of the lowest
volume days of the year,

01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:54.809
with less than half
normal daily trading.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:57.725
Now, even so, we did have some
big individual stories today,

01:19:57.749 --> 01:20:01.120
including serious
Sears holdings.

01:22:04.026 --> 01:22:05.026
We need to talk.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:05.984
About what?

01:22:06.008 --> 01:22:08.203
About Alex, GeoPak, everything.

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:09.895
Why are you dressed like...
You know what,

01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:11.587
that's all gonna have
to wait, I got the...

01:22:11.611 --> 01:22:13.831
Yeah, John, I can't wait.

01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:16.453
Sit down.

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:23.063
I don't know what you think
is going on around here,

01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:25.786
but the SEC came, they
took a look around,

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:28.267
they came up with
nothing conclusive.

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:31.816
So no formal orders then?

01:22:32.991 --> 01:22:35.535
And everyone's fine?
Alex is fine?

01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:37.885
I wouldn't say that.

01:22:37.909 --> 01:22:40.888
Alex's name is on all
of those trades.

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:42.498
I don't think I need
to explain to you

01:22:42.522 --> 01:22:44.829
why that means we need
to get rid of him.

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.156
Yeah, that would be a mistake.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.878
That's my call to make.

01:23:04.936 --> 01:23:07.286
It'd be a mistake because...

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.202
it was me.

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:13.553
All me.

01:23:15.135 --> 01:23:17.055
I got hold of the information
on the buyer's side

01:23:17.079 --> 01:23:20.101
of the deal, but I
can't mention how.

01:23:20.125 --> 01:23:22.103
And then I had Alex
do the transactions

01:23:22.127 --> 01:23:24.825
to throw off the scent.

01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:29.265
And it all worked.

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:31.919
It worked too well.

01:23:43.105 --> 01:23:46.954
And it'll continue to work well

01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:49.957
because you're taking this
with you to the grave

01:23:49.981 --> 01:23:53.158
and we're not reopening
this chapter again, okay?

01:23:57.336 --> 01:24:00.881
And now, go wait
outside my office.

01:24:00.905 --> 01:24:03.105
Somebody will come by shortly
to escort you to your desk

01:24:03.129 --> 01:24:06.393
where you can pack
up your things.

01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:32.347
I have to say goodbye
to you, Iji.

01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.219
Why?

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:36.786
Not as smart as I thought.

01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:39.074
Or too smart by half.

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:42.947
Remember you told me about...

01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:47.212
secrets and their cost?

01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:51.932
What happens when you
tell someone the truth?

01:24:51.956 --> 01:24:56.458
You may not get exactly
what you want,

01:24:56.482 --> 01:24:59.548
but if a person cares about you,

01:24:59.572 --> 01:25:05.448
the person will listen and
embrace you for who you are.

01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:12.281
I hope to see more of you, Seyi.

01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:17.721
Ah, all right.

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:49.666
Thanks for coming.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:51.687
How are you feeling?

01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:52.973
Like shit.

01:25:58.109 --> 01:26:00.870
I wanted to share
something with you

01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:04.744
about my dad, if that's okay?

01:26:04.768 --> 01:26:05.943
Of course.

01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:11.905
I don't know where to start.

01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:18.410
He was born in rural Nigeria

01:26:18.434 --> 01:26:21.021
to illiterate farmers.

01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:24.416
There was a British colony then.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.418
He learned to read
and write because of

01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:29.290
Irish Catholic
missionaries who came.

01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:32.554
One of them saw something
special in my dad,

01:26:32.578 --> 01:26:36.645
helped him move ahead in school.

01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:40.258
He spent so much time
always studying that,

01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:43.870
as my mom tells it, my
granddad was afraid

01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:45.524
that his son would be taken away

01:26:45.548 --> 01:26:48.551
and sacrificed to the
white man's God.

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:56.448
He took that education
and he ran with it,

01:26:56.472 --> 01:26:59.494
made it to college.

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:03.759
You know, my mom says he
could've been anything.

01:27:03.783 --> 01:27:07.937
Instead he decided to work
for the new government,

01:27:07.961 --> 01:27:10.050
to be a civil servant.

01:27:11.574 --> 01:27:15.882
That's what he always
called himself, a servant.

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:21.560
Whatever money he had, he'd
give away for clothes,

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:26.173
books so other kids
could do what he did.

01:27:26.197 --> 01:27:30.046
And when the country
fell into dictatorship,

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.855
and they had to leave...

01:27:35.989 --> 01:27:37.643
came here...

01:27:41.299 --> 01:27:45.347
Without a thought, he
got a job in a hotel.

01:27:46.478 --> 01:27:48.761
She became a nurse,

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:51.744
to make a life for
my sister and me.

01:27:55.008 --> 01:27:56.967
They're good people.

01:27:58.925 --> 01:28:00.710
He's a good person,

01:28:03.974 --> 01:28:07.020
but he could never
accept his past and...

01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:18.641
One day he'd make a
terrible mistake,

01:28:21.252 --> 01:28:23.689
and hurt someone he loved.

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:28.738
He hasn't been able to confront
that either because...

01:28:30.957 --> 01:28:32.916
I don't know, maybe...

01:28:35.005 --> 01:28:38.269
he feels like he
won't be forgiven...

01:28:43.056 --> 01:28:44.493
he won't be loved...

01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:49.280
he'd be alone.

01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:56.853
You can try to
escape these things,

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.030
chase something better...

01:29:03.381 --> 01:29:05.992
maybe even succeed wildly.

01:29:13.086 --> 01:29:15.001
You can do all of that right...

01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:20.964
and still get life so wrong.

01:29:30.974 --> 01:29:32.889
I think maybe...

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:36.806
he understands this now.
