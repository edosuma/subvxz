00:19.884 --> 00:21.818
Hey, how did
your meeting go?

00:21.886 --> 00:23.319
It's over, Donna.

00:23.387 --> 00:25.321
Marie and I
finally signed off

00:25.389 --> 00:27.653
on a money settlement
and a custody arrangement.

00:27.725 --> 00:30.250
I feel like a thousand-pound
weight's off my back.

00:30.327 --> 00:32.261
Now you can get on
with your life.

00:32.329 --> 00:36.265
That's how I feel, like
I can finally turn a page.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.301
You look great today.

00:38.369 --> 00:41.930
Thanks.
So do you.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.274
And that perfume
you're wearing...

00:45.342 --> 00:46.775
drives me wild.

00:46.844 --> 00:48.641
Gregory...

00:48.712 --> 00:50.270
remember where we are.

00:50.347 --> 00:51.780
I can't help it.

00:51.849 --> 00:54.283
Whenever
I'm around you...

00:54.351 --> 00:56.785
I just...
I just want to...

01:07.765 --> 01:08.891
Excuse me.

01:11.735 --> 01:12.997
Oh.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.833
Can you sign this
for me?

01:25.349 --> 01:27.283
Morning, Detective.

01:28.352 --> 01:29.284
Counselor.

01:29.353 --> 01:30.786
On the Andretti stabbings...

01:30.854 --> 01:34.255
his lawyer's all over me
for your paperwork.

01:34.325 --> 01:36.657
Yeah, all right,
well... here.

01:36.727 --> 01:39.753
Tell him this is every
piece of paper I got...

01:39.830 --> 01:42.264
except I'm still trying to
find those two Kleenexes

01:42.333 --> 01:44.563
I sneezed in
at the crime scene.

01:44.635 --> 01:45.624
Thanks.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.306
Uh, ahem, Counselor.

01:51.275 --> 01:53.766
In terms of our conversation
the other night...

01:53.844 --> 01:56.278
I don't want you feeling
pressured with that.

01:56.347 --> 01:57.279
I don't.

01:57.348 --> 01:59.282
My point is
it's not imminent.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.681
It doesn't have to be.

02:00.751 --> 02:04.278
Could be way, way down
the road, you know...

02:04.355 --> 02:07.051
if you wanted that at all.

02:07.124 --> 02:09.285
The nicest thing that's
ever happened to me

02:09.360 --> 02:11.726
is you asking me
to be your wife.

02:13.464 --> 02:17.764
I just want to settle into it
before we make any decisions.

02:17.835 --> 02:20.167
Well, that's smart.
That's good.

02:20.237 --> 02:21.295
Andy.

02:21.372 --> 02:23.101
Good morning.

02:23.173 --> 02:24.731
Hi, Sylvia.

02:24.808 --> 02:26.241
Um, Theresa Carlin...

02:26.310 --> 02:29.802
Domestic abuse.
Yeah, I took her 61.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.747
She's a homicide. Neighbor found
her body in her apartment.

02:32.816 --> 02:34.078
Son of a bitch.

02:34.151 --> 02:36.119
Medavoy, Martinez,
we got a homicide.

02:36.186 --> 02:39.246
I knew it.
That son of a bitch.

02:39.323 --> 02:41.086
Detective Adrianne Lesniak.

02:41.158 --> 02:42.921
I'm supposed to report
to Lieutenant Fancy.

02:42.993 --> 02:45.860
I think he's busy
just for the second.

02:45.929 --> 02:47.521
No problem.

02:47.598 --> 02:49.691
That son of a bitch killed her.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.770
- Excuse us.
- No problem.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.382
The Lower East Side's
going to be a change

04:08.458 --> 04:09.891
from the 27.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.392
I grew up in Bayridge.

04:11.461 --> 04:13.725
I did my time in uniform
in Bed-Stuy.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.993
I'm comfortable among
the great unwashed.

04:17.065 --> 04:20.399
Lieutenant, on the reason
I was transferred...

04:20.470 --> 04:21.903
That's not my concern

04:21.971 --> 04:24.405
unless it interferes
with your work for me.

04:24.474 --> 04:26.908
It won't.
That relationship is finished.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.245
Yeah.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.744
Yeah, O.K.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.510
We got another homicide.

04:39.255 --> 04:41.018
Excuse me a second.

04:43.059 --> 04:44.026
Thanks.

04:45.495 --> 04:46.427
Hey, John.

04:46.496 --> 04:47.463
Sorry, Lieutenant.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.589
I tookJanice
to the probation hearing.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.098
That domestic violence victim

04:51.167 --> 04:53.431
Andy worked a couple
of weeks ago

04:53.503 --> 04:54.936
showed up a homicide.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.130
Mrs. Carlin.

04:56.205 --> 04:58.935
And we just had another
homicide in Chinatown.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.032
Mm-hmm.

05:00.109 --> 05:02.373
That's the new
transfer... Lesniak.

05:02.445 --> 05:03.537
Right.

05:03.613 --> 05:05.945
O.K., I'll work the Chinatown
with her then.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.609
Lieutenant, you
better take this.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.242
He'll be right here.

05:11.521 --> 05:12.783
Fancy.

05:14.791 --> 05:18.056
Yeah. O.K.

05:18.127 --> 05:21.028
That shooting in Chinatown...

05:21.097 --> 05:22.894
an off-duty cop.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.398
I'm going to ask you to work
with Detective Sipowicz.

05:29.472 --> 05:31.906
Our P.A.A.
Will give you the address.

05:31.974 --> 05:33.407
Adrianne Lesniak,
John Kelly.

05:33.476 --> 05:35.137
- How do you do?
- Hi.

05:35.211 --> 05:39.409
Donna, give Detective Lesniak
the address on Andy's homicide...

05:39.482 --> 05:41.916
and have Medavoy and
Martinez 10-1 the squad

05:41.984 --> 05:43.918
and move over to
the Chinatown shooting.

05:43.986 --> 05:44.918
All right.

06:02.605 --> 06:04.004
Who is he?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.973
Paul Van Pool,
Central Park Precinct.

06:06.042 --> 06:07.976
He interrupted
a burglary in progress...

06:08.044 --> 06:09.477
had his shield out.

06:09.545 --> 06:11.479
We got a description
of a male Asian

06:11.547 --> 06:13.505
from a witness who tried
to stop the shooter.

06:13.638 --> 06:15.401
Guy slipped out of his jacket

06:15.473 --> 06:17.065
and took off
towards Canal Street.

06:17.142 --> 06:18.575
Is that the witness?

06:18.643 --> 06:19.575
Yeah.

06:19.644 --> 06:21.271
Take him to
the station house...

06:21.346 --> 06:22.836
see what you can get.

06:22.914 --> 06:24.848
Also, inventory
the contents of the jacket.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.350
And move that line back.

06:27.419 --> 06:29.353
Get those people
out of here.

06:29.421 --> 06:31.855
We're going to need
a Chinese cop.

06:31.923 --> 06:34.357
I'll get Harold Ng
from the robbery squad.

06:34.426 --> 06:37.361
Has anyone contacted
the chaplain's unit

06:37.429 --> 06:38.862
on notification of kin?

06:38.930 --> 06:40.397
Not yet.

06:40.465 --> 06:41.864
Let me go do that.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.275
Is there anything else?

06:53.344 --> 06:54.868
The guy hit her
all the time.

06:54.946 --> 06:56.880
I heard her screaming on
Christmas Eve, for God's sake.

06:56.948 --> 06:58.882
In terms of last night
and this morning...

06:58.950 --> 07:00.383
you didn't actually
hear anything.

07:00.452 --> 07:01.384
No.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.387
Thanks. You've been
very helpful.

07:03.455 --> 07:04.888
Detective Martinez?

07:04.956 --> 07:06.890
Adrianne Lesniak.
I'm your relief.

07:06.958 --> 07:07.890
Welcome aboard.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.984
Detective Medavoy
already left.

07:10.061 --> 07:12.393
Let me introduce you
to Detective Sipowicz.

07:12.464 --> 07:15.900
Get pictures of the glass on
the floor around that window

07:15.967 --> 07:18.401
and that bogus ransack
of the dresser.

07:18.470 --> 07:19.903
Andy, this is
Detective Lesniak.

07:19.971 --> 07:23.532
Fancy wants me on the canvass
at that Chinatown shooting.

07:23.608 --> 07:26.338
The neighbor says Mr. Carlin
called her from work

07:26.411 --> 07:29.346
and asked her to put a note
on the refrigerator

07:29.414 --> 07:31.348
that he was going
to be working late.

07:31.416 --> 07:33.350
So he could establish
his alibi.

07:33.418 --> 07:35.249
Carlin said he'd
been calling his wife...

07:35.320 --> 07:36.617
but there was no answer.

07:36.688 --> 07:38.622
The neighbor had a key.
She let herself in.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.123
She found the body.

07:40.191 --> 07:42.125
You better get over
to Chinatown.

07:42.193 --> 07:43.558
Nice meeting you.

07:43.628 --> 07:44.890
Same here.

07:44.963 --> 07:47.363
So I understand you took
a domestic violence complaint

07:47.432 --> 07:48.729
on this victim.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.926
Yeah.

07:52.937 --> 07:55.701
See, not all
that damage is recent.

07:55.773 --> 07:57.206
Her jaw is half off

07:57.275 --> 07:59.209
'cause it's broken
on both sides.

07:59.277 --> 08:01.211
That's from about
a month ago.

08:01.279 --> 08:04.271
Eyes are swollen shut. See that
chipped tooth? That's old.

08:04.349 --> 08:05.873
Her husband gave her that

08:05.950 --> 08:08.885
after he lost his Super Bowl
bet last year.

08:10.955 --> 08:13.389
He really beat you
to a pulp this time...

08:13.458 --> 08:14.891
didn't he, Theresa?

08:21.466 --> 08:23.331
You finish taking
statements around here...

08:23.401 --> 08:24.834
and then canvass the block.

08:24.903 --> 08:26.165
Get to everybody,
you understand?

08:26.237 --> 08:27.602
Where are you going?

08:27.672 --> 08:29.606
I'm going to
pick up the husband...

08:29.674 --> 08:31.608
unless you got
a problem with that.

08:31.676 --> 08:32.607
I don't.

08:32.677 --> 08:34.611
Don't you worry
where I'm going.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.613
Just worry about what
you got to do.

08:36.681 --> 08:38.114
Are you getting my drift?

08:38.182 --> 08:39.149
Yes.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.850
All right, yeah,
I'll hold. All right.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.355
Donna, could
you get me a pencil?

08:49.427 --> 08:50.359
Sure.

08:50.428 --> 08:52.055
You done with
those notifications?

08:52.130 --> 08:53.563
Yeah. Where are you?

08:53.631 --> 08:56.065
Got a sketch artist
in there with the witness...

08:56.134 --> 08:58.568
but he didn't get
a good look at him.

08:58.636 --> 09:00.069
Contents of the jacket?

09:00.138 --> 09:02.072
House key,
Medavoy's making a copy...

09:02.140 --> 09:04.074
got a phone number
on this guy Shen...

09:04.142 --> 09:05.871
and a lottery ticket.

09:05.944 --> 09:08.538
James is on the phone
with the commission now.

09:08.613 --> 09:11.377
We're getting a lot of calls
from off-duty cops

09:11.449 --> 09:12.882
from the Central Park
Precinct...

09:12.951 --> 09:14.885
volunteering to help
with the investigation.

09:14.953 --> 09:17.786
Take their names.
Tell them we'll contact them

09:17.855 --> 09:19.288
if we need them.

09:19.357 --> 09:20.756
Hey, Johnny,
how are you?

09:20.825 --> 09:21.917
Hey, Harold.

09:21.993 --> 09:24.894
When I first hear
a Chinese guy shoot a cop...

09:24.963 --> 09:26.897
I say,
You kidding me?"

09:26.965 --> 09:28.899
Chinese afraid of police.
Must be real scumbag.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.902
We get him,
we kick his ass, eh, Johnny?

09:31.970 --> 09:33.403
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

09:33.471 --> 09:34.904
The lottery ticket
was bought

09:34.973 --> 09:36.964
at the Chinese herb store
on Mott Street.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.906
James Martinez,
Harold Ng from robbery.

09:38.977 --> 09:40.911
Nice to meet you.
You new here?

09:40.979 --> 09:41.911
No.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.676
I bust cases
with all these guys...

09:44.749 --> 09:46.182
John, Greg,
Andy Sipowicz.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.684
Harold and I are
going to talk to Shen.

09:48.753 --> 09:51.051
When Greg gets back,
go to the herb store.

09:51.122 --> 09:53.056
We'll see if anyone
can I.D. The sketch.

09:53.124 --> 09:54.421
Harold, you know what?

09:54.492 --> 09:56.926
I think you need
to speak a little slower

09:56.995 --> 09:59.930
so people understand.
You know what I mean?

09:59.998 --> 10:01.431
No problem.
Let's do it.

10:01.499 --> 10:02.523
Yeah.

10:10.441 --> 10:11.874
Chef will be right out.

10:12.944 --> 10:14.878
Johnny, you see
Tommy Lew?

10:14.946 --> 10:16.880
The famous heroin importer.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.745
He's head
of Hop Sung Tong.

10:18.816 --> 10:20.875
Chef not going to talk
until Tommy give O.K.

10:20.952 --> 10:22.977
So we need his permission
to do our job then.

10:23.054 --> 10:25.648
I'll go over and
explain the situation.

10:25.723 --> 10:27.657
Tong don't want
police trouble.

10:30.461 --> 10:31.951
Go talk to him.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.538
Show him the number.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.014
Tell him we know
it's his.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.916
Tell him we found it
in the jacket

10:54.986 --> 10:56.419
at the crime scene.

10:56.487 --> 10:57.920
Other chefs come to me.

10:57.989 --> 11:00.423
I help find work
in Chinese restaurants.

11:00.491 --> 11:02.925
I give them my number,
they give me theirs.

11:02.994 --> 11:05.087
You remember writing it
on that newspaper?

11:05.163 --> 11:07.097
The guy I write it for

11:07.165 --> 11:08.598
never tell me his name.

11:08.666 --> 11:11.032
You still have
the number he gave you?

11:11.102 --> 11:12.535
Back in the kitchen.

11:12.603 --> 11:14.935
Think this is going to be
O.K. With Tommy?

11:15.006 --> 11:16.439
He cooperating with us.

11:16.507 --> 11:17.769
He's a great man.

11:32.457 --> 11:35.426
Nobody at the herb store
could make an I.D.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.393
Did you get anything
off that phone number?

11:37.462 --> 11:39.896
Traced it to a pay phone
inside. Let's go.

11:39.964 --> 11:42.262
How are the wife
and kids?

11:42.333 --> 11:44.733
Kids are fine. Wife and
I are getting divorced.

11:44.802 --> 11:46.702
My second wife
called first wife...

11:46.771 --> 11:49.899
got together, tell my
third wife not to marry me.

11:49.974 --> 11:52.943
Got to keep ex-wives apart,
remember that.

11:57.482 --> 11:58.471
Excuse us.

12:01.486 --> 12:02.418
That's it.

12:02.487 --> 12:04.421
Should we start
knocking on doors?

12:04.489 --> 12:05.979
You have that key, Greg?

12:06.057 --> 12:07.922
Should we get
a search warrant?

12:07.992 --> 12:10.927
I don't want to waste
a whole day on one

12:10.995 --> 12:12.485
if this ain't the place.

12:27.445 --> 12:29.879
O.K., why don't you guys
grab some air?

12:29.947 --> 12:31.380
A cop got shot, John.

12:31.449 --> 12:33.883
None of us is going to
have a problem

12:33.951 --> 12:35.384
with seeing what's in there.

12:35.453 --> 12:37.387
You don't see
what you don't have to.

12:37.455 --> 12:39.616
I'll be right outside.
Go ahead.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.123
All right. Be careful.

12:41.192 --> 12:43.524
Come on, guys.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.051
Police.

12:54.772 --> 12:56.603
Anyone home?

13:35.446 --> 13:37.038
Get the warrant.

13:37.114 --> 13:40.413
Hey! Hey!
Yo! Hey! Hey!

13:40.484 --> 13:41.416
Stop!

13:52.296 --> 13:55.026
Who's this guy?
Who's this guy?

13:56.667 --> 13:58.100
Do we know this guy?

13:58.169 --> 13:59.101
No.

14:00.471 --> 14:02.166
You speak English?

14:03.241 --> 14:05.106
You speak English?
What's he saying?

14:05.176 --> 14:07.235
He didn't do anything.

14:07.311 --> 14:08.744
Tell him who we are.

14:11.182 --> 14:13.116
This is all
he had on him.

14:14.485 --> 14:15.417
Got him?

14:15.486 --> 14:16.544
These keys match.

14:18.289 --> 14:19.916
The keys match.
Let's go.

14:19.991 --> 14:23.358
We'll talk about it down
at the station. Let's go.

14:28.866 --> 14:30.800
Harold and I will
do the interview.

14:30.868 --> 14:32.733
You guys want to get
started on that warrant?

14:32.803 --> 14:34.737
Yeah, sure.

14:34.805 --> 14:37.296
James, you want to
get it started?

14:37.375 --> 14:38.672
You got it.

14:41.879 --> 14:44.313
Has Lieutenant Fancy
said anything to you?

14:44.382 --> 14:46.816
No. Maybe he's
going to let it slide.

14:46.884 --> 14:50.320
You know that Detective Lesniak
who just got transferred?

14:50.388 --> 14:52.322
You know why
she got transferred?

14:52.390 --> 14:53.322
Why?

14:53.391 --> 14:54.824
Office romance.

14:54.892 --> 14:57.520
Gregory,
this is all my fault.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.029
If anyone was
en flagrante, it was me.

15:00.097 --> 15:02.531
I should have kept this
from happening...

15:02.600 --> 15:05.125
but what did I do instead?
I tempted you.

15:05.202 --> 15:08.831
Look,
whatever happens...

15:08.906 --> 15:11.340
we're in this together.

15:11.409 --> 15:14.344
I just can't imagine
coming to work every day

15:14.412 --> 15:16.346
and not seeing you.

15:16.414 --> 15:17.779
Hey, Detective.

15:23.854 --> 15:26.288
I know what you
got to be thinking.

15:26.357 --> 15:28.291
You busted me
for beating Theresa.

15:28.359 --> 15:31.294
You got to be thinking
that I killed her.

15:31.362 --> 15:34.297
I'm not going to
lie to you, Victor.

15:34.365 --> 15:35.798
I got a situation here

15:35.866 --> 15:38.801
where there's a history
of domestic violence.

15:38.869 --> 15:40.302
Now the wife's dead.

15:40.371 --> 15:43.499
I got to consider you
a suspect.

15:43.574 --> 15:45.508
I know what it looks like...

15:45.576 --> 15:47.066
but I didn't kill Theresa.

15:47.144 --> 15:49.635
The day we had our talk
at that courthouse...

15:49.714 --> 15:51.648
I thought I got
through to you.

15:51.716 --> 15:53.149
With God
as my witness...

15:53.217 --> 15:56.152
I never laid a hand
on her after that.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.814
You gave me
a wake-up call, Detective.

15:58.889 --> 16:02.825
You know, I was
married myself once.

16:02.893 --> 16:04.827
I know what it's like.

16:04.895 --> 16:06.795
You get frustrated...

16:06.864 --> 16:10.823
and sometimes you do things
that afterwards you regret...

16:10.901 --> 16:13.335
but that's a long way

16:13.404 --> 16:16.305
from beating somebody
to death.

16:16.374 --> 16:20.276
I swear to God
I didn't kill her.

16:20.344 --> 16:22.312
I loved her.

16:22.380 --> 16:26.146
And we got this apparent
break-in at your place.

16:26.217 --> 16:28.151
Used to be a nice street.

16:28.219 --> 16:31.711
Now you got
Africans, junkies.

16:31.789 --> 16:34.724
I've been worried about
something like this

16:34.792 --> 16:36.225
for a long time.

16:36.293 --> 16:37.726
You see anybody suspicious

16:37.795 --> 16:40.787
when you left your
apartment this morning?

16:40.865 --> 16:43.800
Actually, I did.

16:43.868 --> 16:46.803
I seen these two brothers
hanging around

16:46.871 --> 16:49.806
across the street
at the liquor store.

16:49.874 --> 16:51.808
Can you give me
their description?

16:51.876 --> 16:54.743
Black as the inside
of your hat.

16:54.812 --> 16:57.303
Anything else about them
you remember?

16:57.381 --> 16:58.973
I don't know.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.315
Maybe I could look
at some pictures.

17:02.386 --> 17:04.319
How are you doing
for time?

17:04.387 --> 17:07.983
You probably got a lot of
arrangements to take care of.

17:08.059 --> 17:11.825
Oh, no, Detective.
I owe it to Theresa

17:11.896 --> 17:13.727
to do whatever I can

17:13.798 --> 17:15.732
to help find whoever did this.

17:19.569 --> 17:22.505
I called the M.E.
To expedite the autopsy

17:22.573 --> 17:24.006
so your wife's remains

17:24.075 --> 17:26.942
can be returned to you
as soon as possible.

17:27.011 --> 17:28.444
Oh, I appreciate that.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.946
Let me set you up
with pictures.

17:39.356 --> 17:42.621
Ask him why he ran
from us this morning.

17:44.862 --> 17:47.023
He's illegal.
Thought we were I.N.S.

17:47.098 --> 17:49.532
Why was he
at the apartment?

17:52.870 --> 17:54.394
Visiting a friend.

17:54.472 --> 17:56.201
What's the key go to?

17:59.376 --> 18:00.775
He doesn't know.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.813
Ask him
if he knows anything

18:02.880 --> 18:05.815
about the cop getting shot
in Chinatown this morning.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.161
No.

18:21.232 --> 18:25.134
No? You guys just spoke
for five minutes.

18:25.202 --> 18:26.635
What's going on, Harold?

18:26.704 --> 18:31.141
He wanted to know why I'm
working with you white ghosts.

18:31.208 --> 18:33.233
Why don't you just
be straight with me?

18:33.310 --> 18:34.777
I just was.

18:34.845 --> 18:37.780
O.K. Maybe he will
change his tune

18:37.848 --> 18:40.783
after he's picked out
of a lineup.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.284
Tell him that.

18:50.361 --> 18:51.794
Detective...

18:51.862 --> 18:54.626
Mr. Woo's lawyer is here.

19:00.871 --> 19:02.862
Detective Kelly.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.840
Stephen Cheng,
Detective.

19:04.909 --> 19:06.877
How do you do?

19:06.944 --> 19:09.606
I'd like to see my client
Woo Shu Kwan.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.615
How do you know we have
that person in custody?

19:12.683 --> 19:14.617
Friends of his
saw you pick him up.

19:14.685 --> 19:16.619
Well, Mr. Woo
has not asked

19:16.687 --> 19:18.621
for the services
of an attorney yet.

19:18.689 --> 19:19.986
A member of his family

19:20.057 --> 19:21.991
has asked me
to represent him.

19:22.059 --> 19:23.993
Who would that be?

19:24.061 --> 19:25.824
Mr. Woo's uncle.

19:25.896 --> 19:27.329
I don't know
why you're here...

19:27.398 --> 19:30.333
but you're going to have
to do better than that.

19:30.401 --> 19:32.995
John, can we talk a minute?

19:34.071 --> 19:35.538
Sure.

19:36.907 --> 19:39.341
Tong send the lawyer
to get Woo to confess...

19:39.410 --> 19:40.843
get it over with.

19:40.911 --> 19:43.175
They're going to
get him to confess.

19:43.247 --> 19:44.509
They do something
for him...

19:44.582 --> 19:46.516
maybe lighten up
on the money he owe...

19:46.584 --> 19:49.018
give money to the guy's
family back in China.

19:49.086 --> 19:52.249
Or get him to confess
to protect the real guy.

19:52.323 --> 19:54.848
We found the key
on this guy, Johnny.

19:54.925 --> 19:56.859
Who put the key
on him, Harold?

19:56.927 --> 20:00.363
Tommy Lew is not going
to make my case for me.

20:00.431 --> 20:01.455
You understand?

20:02.933 --> 20:05.367
You know what?
I'm going to need more proof

20:05.436 --> 20:06.869
that you represent
the family...

20:06.937 --> 20:08.598
so bring the uncle in.

20:08.672 --> 20:10.606
Thanks for your
time, Detective.

20:18.449 --> 20:19.814
What did you get?

20:19.883 --> 20:21.817
No one saw anything
at the building.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.819
These are the no-answers.
I'll recanvass tomorrow.

20:23.887 --> 20:26.515
Let me have those.
The husband's looking at photos.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.717
Let me know
if the Iying prick

20:28.792 --> 20:30.225
comes up with an I.D.

20:30.294 --> 20:32.319
Are you going to
get pissed off

20:32.396 --> 20:34.330
if I ask you
where you're going?

20:34.398 --> 20:35.831
Back to recanvass.

20:35.899 --> 20:37.332
There's a vote of confidence.

20:38.535 --> 20:41.561
Detective Lesniak,
you got a bunch of calls

20:41.639 --> 20:43.573
from a Detective Abruzzo.

20:43.641 --> 20:46.838
I tried telling him you were
tied up with a case.

20:46.910 --> 20:47.934
Thanks.

20:51.515 --> 20:53.949
How's it going
on your case?

20:54.018 --> 20:56.851
Dinner's going to
have to be late.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.354
Let's just
bag dinner then.

20:59.423 --> 21:02.859
I feel bad
about this woman.

21:02.926 --> 21:05.019
You did what you could.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.693
I got to go.

21:10.934 --> 21:11.923
Hey.

21:12.002 --> 21:12.934
Yeah.

21:13.003 --> 21:15.301
If you want to talk,
I'll be up late.

21:24.882 --> 21:25.814
Hey, John.

21:25.883 --> 21:27.316
The chief of detectives

21:27.384 --> 21:30.319
is going to make
a statement to the press.

21:30.387 --> 21:33.322
He wants to know if we're
calling Woo a suspect.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.324
As far as the lineups
are concerned...

21:35.392 --> 21:36.825
I think it's a maybe.

21:36.894 --> 21:39.328
I'd like to keep him
overnight, get him tired...

21:39.396 --> 21:41.330
take a shot at him
in the morning.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.093
O.K. On
showing up late...

21:43.167 --> 21:45.931
If I could make it up now,
that'd be great.

21:46.003 --> 21:48.335
My point is don't
have Andy sign you in.

21:48.405 --> 21:50.839
That's the kind of thing
Haverill's looking for.

21:50.908 --> 21:51.840
Yeah. O.K.

21:51.909 --> 21:53.342
How's Harold Ng doing?

21:53.410 --> 21:54.843
Harold Ng, doing great.

21:54.912 --> 21:56.470
All right.
Good night.

21:56.547 --> 21:57.479
Good night.

22:06.924 --> 22:08.858
Hey, how are we doing?

22:08.926 --> 22:10.359
O.K. How's your case?

22:10.427 --> 22:12.952
I think we got
a direction.

22:13.030 --> 22:14.497
The husband on my homicide

22:14.565 --> 22:16.362
picked out
a couple of photos.

22:16.433 --> 22:17.866
Hmm.
You believe him?

22:17.935 --> 22:19.300
No. One's in the joint...

22:19.370 --> 22:21.304
the other one
I'm going to question

22:21.372 --> 22:23.033
at his parole officer's
tomorrow.

22:23.107 --> 22:26.508
We're going out for a beer.
Want to come along?

22:26.577 --> 22:27.839
Thanks. Yeah.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.344
How about you, Harold?

22:29.413 --> 22:32.314
You want to go out
for a beer?

22:33.884 --> 22:35.044
Yeah. Sure.

22:37.388 --> 22:38.821
We'll talk later.

22:38.889 --> 22:39.821
O.K.

22:41.392 --> 22:43.360
Harold, this
Tommy Lew thing...

22:43.427 --> 22:46.863
you know, I got my bosses
squeezing my shoes...

22:46.930 --> 22:49.831
and maybe I got
my back up.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.333
Yeah, Johnny.
I understand...

22:51.402 --> 22:55.236
but no boss own me,
Tommy Lew especially.

22:55.305 --> 22:56.829
Understand that,
too, O. K?

22:56.907 --> 22:58.841
O.K. Give me a minute.

22:58.909 --> 22:59.898
Yeah.

23:04.415 --> 23:05.848
Ha ha ha!

23:05.916 --> 23:08.350
Harold, tell her about
the possum case.

23:08.419 --> 23:09.477
Possum case?

23:09.553 --> 23:11.851
Yeah. It's a great story.
Come on, Harold.

23:11.922 --> 23:14.235
You tell it great.
Come on.

23:14.302 --> 23:15.234
Go ahead.
Come on.

23:15.303 --> 23:16.964
Go ahead.

23:17.038 --> 23:18.733
O.K. Me and
this other guy

23:18.806 --> 23:20.239
working on a kidnapping.

23:20.308 --> 23:22.242
Kidnapper send
a ransom note.

23:22.310 --> 23:23.743
Letter cut out
of newspaper...

23:23.811 --> 23:26.245
spell out, if you
ever want to see

23:26.314 --> 23:28.248
what-his-name
again... like old movie...

23:28.316 --> 23:30.250
Anyway, we got to make
ransom drop in woods.

23:30.318 --> 23:33.253
We got nothing to put
the money in, only barbecue bag.

23:33.321 --> 23:35.551
The guy love barbecue.
Eat the rib all day.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.148
Everybody follow me?

23:38.226 --> 23:40.160
Yeah, we're
with you, Harold.

23:40.228 --> 23:41.923
We're with you.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.725
So we put money
in barbecue bag...

23:43.798 --> 23:46.824
hide the bag in woods
like kidnapper tell us.

23:46.901 --> 23:50.302
Possum smell barbecue,
eat the money, $10,000.

23:50.371 --> 23:51.804
Everybody follow me?

23:51.873 --> 23:52.805
Yeah.

23:52.874 --> 23:54.307
Hey.

23:56.044 --> 23:57.841
Guy at
the station house

23:57.912 --> 24:00.005
said you might
still be here.

24:00.081 --> 24:01.912
Hey, John.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.314
Hey, Jimmy.

24:03.384 --> 24:05.648
I understand you're working
that, uh, cop shooting.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.652
Yeah.

24:06.721 --> 24:08.416
Good luck with that.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.687
Adie, uh, you got
a moment to talk?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.421
Sure.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.656
Hey, we got to catch up
with each other.

24:16.731 --> 24:17.663
Talk later.

24:17.732 --> 24:19.097
You got it.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.600
Who was that?

24:20.668 --> 24:22.499
What do you want?

24:22.570 --> 24:23.696
Jimmy Abruzzo.

24:23.771 --> 24:26.604
We went through
the homicide course together.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.234
Didn't look
too happy to see him.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.710
They were in
the 27 together.

24:31.779 --> 24:33.713
Nobody knew
they were involved.

24:33.781 --> 24:35.749
Sector car answered
a disturbance call.

24:35.817 --> 24:38.251
They were having
a knockdown drag-out.

24:38.319 --> 24:39.911
That's why she
got transferred.

24:39.988 --> 24:41.080
Don't be such a...

24:41.155 --> 24:42.247
Just listen to me.

24:42.323 --> 24:43.756
Get out of here!

24:43.825 --> 24:45.850
You think this is
over? It's not.

24:45.927 --> 24:47.258
You still love me.

24:47.328 --> 24:48.693
Be right back.

24:48.763 --> 24:50.196
Wait a minute, guys.

24:50.265 --> 24:51.755
Everything O. K?

24:51.833 --> 24:53.266
She's O.K.

24:53.334 --> 24:55.268
Yeah?
I asked her.

24:55.336 --> 24:56.462
I'm fine.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.267
I think you need
to take off, Jimmy.

24:59.340 --> 25:00.773
Go hump
yourself, John.

25:00.842 --> 25:02.309
Butt out, John.

25:11.653 --> 25:14.588
I don't need anybody
protecting me, all right?

25:14.656 --> 25:16.214
My problems
are my problem.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.672
Hey, Andy.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.443
Looking good.

25:42.517 --> 25:44.280
Something about you
different.

25:44.352 --> 25:46.081
How's it going, Harold?

25:46.154 --> 25:48.588
Where the cigarettes?
All the time you smoking.

25:48.656 --> 25:49.588
I quit.

25:49.657 --> 25:50.681
Must be it.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.749
Careful. You get fat
like Goodyear blimp.

25:52.827 --> 25:55.819
It's nice to see
you, too, pal.

25:55.897 --> 25:58.058
Johnny, you ready
to talk to this guy?

25:58.132 --> 25:59.565
Yeah. Let's go.

25:59.634 --> 26:01.397
Doing all right?

26:01.469 --> 26:02.868
Yeah.

26:03.971 --> 26:04.903
Good morning.

26:04.972 --> 26:06.496
Morning.

26:06.574 --> 26:09.338
This guy Carlin picked out
from the mug books...

26:09.410 --> 26:11.776
I'm going to talk
to his parole officers.

26:11.846 --> 26:14.076
Ask him about
the grassy knoll in Dallas

26:14.148 --> 26:17.083
or the whereabouts
on the Lindbergh baby.

26:17.151 --> 26:20.587
Detective, I thought about
this real hard last night.

26:20.655 --> 26:23.852
I can't remember what
I did to piss you off.

26:23.925 --> 26:27.019
If you're running some guilt trip
about this lady dying...

26:27.095 --> 26:28.756
please don't
make it my problem.

26:28.830 --> 26:30.855
Do you moonlight
as a shrink?

26:30.932 --> 26:33.366
No. This job
is hard enough...

26:33.434 --> 26:35.664
and it does not include
you batting me around

26:35.737 --> 26:38.865
like some inflatable
punching clown.

26:38.940 --> 26:41.534
So I'm going to go
question this guy...

26:41.609 --> 26:43.600
even if it's just
to rule him out.

26:43.678 --> 26:46.146
Meanwhile,
I would appreciate it

26:46.214 --> 26:48.705
if you'd take your attitude

26:48.783 --> 26:50.580
and shove it up
your ass.

26:55.022 --> 26:58.685
O.K., he's had the whole night
to think about it.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.387
We're putting this together...

27:00.461 --> 27:02.588
so we need a statement

27:02.663 --> 27:03.960
and his description
of the events.

27:10.371 --> 27:12.737
He said he doesn't
know anything.

27:12.807 --> 27:16.038
Well, tell him
that I'm certain

27:16.110 --> 27:18.442
he didn't kill this
police officer intentionally...

27:18.513 --> 27:20.447
but I need a statement...

27:20.515 --> 27:22.983
and I need his description
of the events.

27:30.224 --> 27:32.658
He said he doesn't
know anything.

27:40.568 --> 27:41.865
What's up?

27:41.936 --> 27:45.872
That lawyer, Mr. Cheng,
wants to talk to you again.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.813
Where's Uncle Woo?

27:53.881 --> 27:56.714
Hi, Detective. Mr. Woo Hong Lee,
my client's uncle...

27:56.784 --> 27:58.718
was too infirm
to be here.

27:58.786 --> 28:01.619
This notarized letter authorizing
me to represent his nephew

28:01.689 --> 28:02.747
should suffice.

28:02.824 --> 28:05.452
I also have a letter
from the uncle's doctor

28:05.526 --> 28:07.187
attesting
to his poor health.

28:08.529 --> 28:09.655
Wait here.

28:15.036 --> 28:17.527
Tell him there's
a lawyer outside

28:17.605 --> 28:19.698
who's been hired
by his uncle.

28:19.774 --> 28:22.937
Ask him if he wants
him to represent him.

28:28.950 --> 28:30.212
No.

28:30.284 --> 28:34.721
O.K., tell him I want him
to tell the lawyer that.

28:36.724 --> 28:38.123
Let's go.

28:42.897 --> 28:44.228
Ask him.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.667
What'd he say?

28:52.740 --> 28:56.540
He said the Tong want
to help him and his family.

28:58.246 --> 29:00.180
He wants the lawyer now.

29:00.248 --> 29:03.183
I'd like some time
with my client.

29:03.251 --> 29:05.617
O.K., Counselor, but
we get no sacrificial lambs.

29:05.686 --> 29:09.554
If he confesses to me,
I better believe it. Got it?

29:33.681 --> 29:35.114
Excuse me, ma'am.

29:35.182 --> 29:37.480
Detective Sipowicz.

29:37.552 --> 29:40.248
Oh, yeah, Detective.
I saw you after the murder.

29:40.321 --> 29:42.448
I'm the one
who found Mrs. Carlin.

29:42.523 --> 29:44.047
Right. You live
in this apartment?

29:44.125 --> 29:45.558
No. Irene Polotto
lives here.

29:45.626 --> 29:48.094
I grocery shop for her.
She's a shut-in.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.562
She's out. Nobody
ever answers the door.

29:50.631 --> 29:52.064
She can't hear you knock.

29:52.133 --> 29:53.065
She's deaf.

29:53.134 --> 29:56.069
This is how I let
her know I'm here.

29:56.137 --> 29:57.399
I flick the switch.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.736
It's O.K., Irene.

30:02.810 --> 30:05.244
This man's a police officer.

30:05.313 --> 30:07.941
He was wondering if he
could ask you about Theresa.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.505
Oh.

30:09.584 --> 30:12.781
She reads lips,
so speak slowly and clearly.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.151
I'll put these away.

30:17.091 --> 30:20.959
Ma'am, I'm
Detective Sipowicz.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.054
I'm hoping you can help us
with our investigation.

30:24.131 --> 30:25.530
I'll certainly try.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.296
Were you home the morning
of the murder?

30:28.369 --> 30:31.532
Yeah, but I didn't know
anything was wrong

30:31.606 --> 30:33.540
until I looked
out the window

30:33.608 --> 30:35.041
and saw the police cars.

30:35.109 --> 30:38.545
Did you see the victim's
husband that morning?

30:38.613 --> 30:41.047
I saw him leave
for work.

30:41.115 --> 30:43.049
What time
would that have been?

30:43.117 --> 30:44.550
I'm not sure exactly.

30:44.619 --> 30:47.645
It must've been early because
I was feeding my pigeons...

30:47.722 --> 30:52.455
and they get impatient if I don't
feed them before 9:00...

30:52.526 --> 30:53.720
especially Tommy.

30:53.794 --> 30:57.059
Was there anything unusual

30:57.131 --> 30:59.258
about Mr. Carlin's behavior?

30:59.333 --> 31:01.893
Did he seem agitated?

31:01.969 --> 31:04.335
No. Do you mind
if I sit down?

31:04.405 --> 31:05.804
I got a bum knee.

31:05.873 --> 31:06.805
Please, sit.

31:06.874 --> 31:09.308
So he walked out
the door

31:09.377 --> 31:12.312
and headed for the subway,
is that right?

31:12.380 --> 31:15.508
Yeah. After he threw
out the garbage.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.709
What garbage?

31:16.784 --> 31:19.344
He was carrying
a garbage bag.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.581
Doesn't this building
have a trash chute?

31:21.656 --> 31:23.886
Ha! Sometimes
it backs up.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.892
Did you happen to see

31:25.960 --> 31:28.622
where Mr. Carlin
took that bag of garbage?

31:28.696 --> 31:32.132
Yeah. To the building
next door, across the alley.

31:32.199 --> 31:33.131
Thank you.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.633
You've been very helpful.

31:34.702 --> 31:35.896
Yeah.

31:42.443 --> 31:45.537
I went to worker's apartment
owned by Mr. Fong.

31:45.613 --> 31:49.105
Mr. Fong owns
a restaurant.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.086
All his illegal workers
live there.

31:54.155 --> 31:55.622
I live there, too.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.560
Until Mr. Fong fired me
for no reason.

32:01.962 --> 32:05.830
I knew someone who lived
there who has a gun.

32:05.900 --> 32:09.631
I wanted to sell it
for a lot of money.

32:09.704 --> 32:12.696
I went out the door.

32:13.941 --> 32:15.966
Saw the policeman.

32:16.043 --> 32:17.704
I got scared.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.141
I never touched
a gun before.

32:23.484 --> 32:26.419
Never thought...
now I kill a man.

32:31.358 --> 32:33.986
I owe 30,000 U.S. Dollars

32:34.061 --> 32:36.086
being smuggled
in the U.S.

32:37.298 --> 32:39.528
The trip took
two months...

32:39.600 --> 32:43.092
locked in the hold
of a cargo ship...

32:43.170 --> 32:45.866
squeezed in with 300 men.

32:45.940 --> 32:48.033
No toilet.

32:48.109 --> 32:50.873
No water
to wash hand or bathe.

32:50.945 --> 32:53.038
Everyone was sick.

32:53.114 --> 32:55.173
Who do you owe
the 30,000 to?

32:55.249 --> 32:59.049
Excuse me. What case are we
working on here, Detective?

33:03.891 --> 33:06.951
Ask him how
he lost the jacket.

33:14.335 --> 33:16.269
Someone tried
to stop me.

33:16.337 --> 33:18.271
Grabbed me
by my jacket.

33:18.339 --> 33:22.207
I didn't want
to shoot him, too.

33:23.511 --> 33:25.502
I slipped out of my jacket

33:25.579 --> 33:27.843
and ran towards
Canal Street.

33:31.252 --> 33:33.447
I came to America
to earn money

33:33.521 --> 33:34.988
to send money home.

33:36.090 --> 33:40.356
After I arrive,
I could not find work.

33:40.427 --> 33:42.395
No money
to send home.

33:45.466 --> 33:48.526
I lived any way
I can, in filth...

33:48.602 --> 33:50.035
always dirty.

33:50.104 --> 33:53.904
In China, it's never
like this. Worse than animal.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.739
I'm sorry.

34:01.315 --> 34:03.340
I'm very sorry.

34:07.555 --> 34:10.717
I never wanted
to hurt anyone.

34:12.626 --> 34:13.717
O.K.

34:26.974 --> 34:28.202
I buy it.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.206
Yeah.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.541
I'll bring the guy down
and book him...

34:32.612 --> 34:34.045
then finish the paperwork.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.308
Good job, Harold.

34:35.382 --> 34:36.313
O.K., Loo.

34:36.382 --> 34:38.817
The jacket sold you,
huh, Johnny?

34:38.886 --> 34:40.717
How the guy grabbed
the jacket?

34:40.788 --> 34:44.382
That's right. You brought
this one home, Harold.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.187
Hey, Johnny.

34:46.260 --> 34:50.458
Dead cop... if this was the guineas
looking to keep the pressure off...

34:50.531 --> 34:52.328
then give up the guy
who really did it...

34:52.399 --> 34:53.797
is that a problem?

34:53.868 --> 34:55.927
Not if he were guilty.

34:56.003 --> 34:59.461
Maybe you would've
seen it a little easier.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.604
I needed the help.

35:04.345 --> 35:07.872
Anyway, maybe this will
keep Haverill off your back.

35:07.948 --> 35:09.472
Maybe.

35:09.550 --> 35:11.040
Thanks.

35:11.118 --> 35:12.050
Yeah.

35:22.863 --> 35:24.262
Where's the other detective?

35:24.331 --> 35:27.164
She said there was more mug
shots for me to look at.

35:27.234 --> 35:31.762
I don't think that'd be
the best use of your time.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.306
Sit down.

35:33.374 --> 35:38.107
I want to bring you up to date
on a couple things.

35:38.178 --> 35:41.773
Your African perpetrator
theory... that didn't pan out.

35:41.849 --> 35:45.785
I I.D.'d the two guys I seen
hanging around the building.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.286
One's in the joint...

35:47.354 --> 35:50.289
and the other was
at his job all day.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.086
His parole officer
verified it.

35:52.159 --> 35:54.093
I know what I saw.

35:54.161 --> 35:55.594
We're kind of questioning

35:55.663 --> 35:58.291
that whole break-in
theory now.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.232
The place was torn up.
It was ransacked.

36:01.302 --> 36:04.237
I'll tell you, that window
was broken out.

36:04.305 --> 36:07.240
There was busted glass
all on the sidewalk.

36:07.308 --> 36:11.267
That meant somebody had to
break it from the inside.

36:11.345 --> 36:14.644
Plus, what do you
make of this?

36:15.950 --> 36:19.852
They're size 12. You look
like you're about a 12.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.855
Does that look like
dried blood to you?

36:22.923 --> 36:25.357
Looks like
dried blood to me.

36:25.426 --> 36:28.361
There's some
bloody overalls in here, too.

36:28.429 --> 36:31.262
Made a real mess of
things, didn't you?

36:31.332 --> 36:33.266
So there's blood
on them.

36:33.334 --> 36:37.737
I work in a meat-packing plant.
There's blood all over.

36:37.805 --> 36:40.239
The DNA tests will prove
that's your wife's blood.

36:40.307 --> 36:41.774
If that's my wife's blood...

36:41.842 --> 36:44.242
then whoever did this
took my clothes

36:44.311 --> 36:46.404
and put them
in her blood afterward.

36:46.480 --> 36:50.416
Then they threw them in the
next building's trash chute...

36:50.484 --> 36:52.008
where your neighbor
saw you drop a bag.

36:52.086 --> 36:54.281
I dropped a bag
of garbage.

36:54.355 --> 36:57.290
Sometimes our chute
gets backed up.

36:57.358 --> 37:00.225
You killed her,
you scumbag son of a bitch.

37:00.294 --> 37:02.159
You beat her to death!

37:02.229 --> 37:05.062
I got to give you
one last chance to confess

37:05.132 --> 37:06.622
and make it
easier on yourself!

37:06.700 --> 37:08.930
I'm hoping you're
too stupid to do that!

37:09.003 --> 37:13.064
'Cause the harder it is for you,
the happier I am!

37:16.543 --> 37:19.979
So are you gonna
tell me the truth now...

37:20.047 --> 37:22.982
or are you gonna
make me happy?

37:23.050 --> 37:24.142
Tick tock, Victor.

37:24.218 --> 37:25.480
What's it gonna be?

37:28.489 --> 37:30.354
I'm missing happy hour.

37:30.424 --> 37:32.051
You prick.
You prick!

37:32.126 --> 37:33.150
Let go of me!

37:33.227 --> 37:35.161
You prick!
You killed her!

37:35.229 --> 37:36.662
Get off of me!

37:36.730 --> 37:38.163
Shut up!

38:07.194 --> 38:08.627
You were watching?

38:08.695 --> 38:10.526
Is that O. K?

38:14.068 --> 38:15.501
Nursemaid this guy.

38:15.569 --> 38:17.867
I got to clear my head.

38:32.419 --> 38:34.353
I'll tell you, Mr. Carlin...

38:34.421 --> 38:37.356
I wouldn't want
to be you right now.

38:37.424 --> 38:39.933
Hey, that wacko
just hit me.

38:40.066 --> 38:42.830
He touches me again,
and he goes to jail.

38:42.902 --> 38:45.200
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

38:45.271 --> 38:49.207
I've worked with that
detective for a lot of years.

38:49.275 --> 38:52.335
These situations always
go down the same way.

38:52.412 --> 38:55.643
You'll wind up in the
emergency room, pissing blood...

38:55.715 --> 38:57.649
and I'm looking
at 12 hours of paperwork

38:57.717 --> 38:59.708
explaining how
you resisted arrest.

38:59.786 --> 39:02.721
You can't let him
do that.

39:02.789 --> 39:04.882
I can't control him.

39:04.958 --> 39:09.395
My advice to you is give
the guy what he wants...

39:09.462 --> 39:11.930
or it's going to be a long night
for the both of us.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.334
We got ourselves a cop.

39:16.402 --> 39:20.338
Yeah. Can you make a case
off the bloody clothes?

39:20.406 --> 39:23.341
Can't put the guy
in the clothes.

39:23.409 --> 39:26.845
L... I didn't recover
the bag for 36 hours.

39:26.913 --> 39:28.847
He doesn't like you.

39:28.915 --> 39:32.976
Whatever he is, he's gonna
be coming back any minute.

39:33.052 --> 39:34.713
He can't do that to me.

39:38.524 --> 39:41.425
Excuse us,
Detective Lesniak.

39:41.494 --> 39:42.961
All right.

39:47.467 --> 39:49.992
Beep beep, Carlin.

39:50.069 --> 39:51.093
Beep beep?

39:51.170 --> 39:53.104
I know about you,
Sipowicz.

39:53.172 --> 39:54.605
You're a psycho.

39:54.674 --> 39:56.266
We're going to start over...

39:56.342 --> 39:58.367
only I brought
my lie detector with me.

39:58.444 --> 40:00.605
Every time my lie detector
goes beep beep...

40:00.680 --> 40:02.614
you're going
to get smacked.

40:02.682 --> 40:04.377
I want to be interviewed
by somebody else.

40:04.450 --> 40:07.112
First question... the morning
your wife was killed...

40:07.186 --> 40:08.983
what time did you
leave the house?

40:09.055 --> 40:09.987
Leave me alone.

40:10.056 --> 40:11.648
What time did you leave?

40:11.724 --> 40:13.214
8:00!

40:13.293 --> 40:14.385
Very good.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.394
What did you do
when you went outside?

40:16.462 --> 40:17.394
I went to work.

40:17.463 --> 40:18.896
Beep beep.

40:18.965 --> 40:21.900
No... no... I took
the garbage out...

40:21.968 --> 40:24.903
and I took it
to the building next door.

40:24.971 --> 40:26.302
Then I went to work.

40:26.372 --> 40:27.339
Very good.

40:27.407 --> 40:30.308
What was in the garbage
you put out?

40:30.376 --> 40:31.468
Uh, just garbage.

40:32.745 --> 40:34.007
Beep beep.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.069
Just garbage.

40:35.148 --> 40:36.080
Beep beep!

40:36.149 --> 40:37.081
Oh, no.

40:37.150 --> 40:39.084
Oh, all right.

40:39.152 --> 40:41.120
It was clothes.

40:41.187 --> 40:44.588
And then you threw them
in the trash next door?

40:44.657 --> 40:46.522
That's right.

40:46.592 --> 40:49.356
I did not intend
for her to die.

40:49.429 --> 40:54.526
What you don't know is that
I was provoked on a daily basis...

40:54.600 --> 40:57.262
and the outcome
of what happened

40:57.337 --> 40:59.669
was... was the result of that.

41:03.209 --> 41:05.200
You start writing.

41:06.813 --> 41:08.508
Beep beep.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.529
Medavoy, come see me.

41:23.596 --> 41:25.655
I'll be right there, sir.

41:40.079 --> 41:43.014
Let's say two people
in the station house

41:43.082 --> 41:44.913
were having
a romantic relationship...

41:44.984 --> 41:48.750
and let's say I were
to find out about it.

41:48.821 --> 41:51.415
I'd have to get
one of them transferred.

41:51.491 --> 41:52.924
Are you aware of that?

41:52.992 --> 41:54.755
Yes, I am, sir.

41:54.827 --> 41:57.261
So if anyone was to engage

41:57.330 --> 41:59.195
in that kind of a relationship...

41:59.265 --> 42:02.632
and if they didn't
want to get transferred...

42:02.702 --> 42:05.694
I think they'd be very careful
about how they acted...

42:05.772 --> 42:06.864
wouldn't you?

42:06.939 --> 42:08.497
Uh, yes, I would.

42:10.276 --> 42:12.710
I'm... sorry.

42:12.779 --> 42:14.713
As far as I know...

42:14.781 --> 42:17.579
you haven't done anything
to be sorry for.

42:20.953 --> 42:24.116
And I want you
to keep it that way.

42:24.190 --> 42:25.714
Uh, right.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.919
Thank you, sir.

42:27.994 --> 42:29.859
Good night.

42:31.064 --> 42:32.190
Good night.

42:51.384 --> 42:54.581
Hey, Johnny, you want
to type this?

42:54.654 --> 42:55.951
Your job, Harold.

43:03.963 --> 43:05.863
Carlin tape
his statement?

43:05.932 --> 43:09.095
For a drunk,
he's got a good memory.

43:10.436 --> 43:13.701
Now there's a guy
who wants my ass so bad...

43:13.773 --> 43:15.536
he can taste it.

43:15.608 --> 43:18.372
He can taste my ass, too,
while he's at it.

43:18.444 --> 43:20.707
Good night.

43:20.780 --> 43:23.806
You know, you want to get
some dinner?

43:23.883 --> 43:27.512
Uh, I was kind of hoping
Sylvia might stop by later.

43:27.587 --> 43:28.519
O.K.

43:28.588 --> 43:30.021
How did Lesniak do?

43:30.089 --> 43:31.454
She did good.

43:31.524 --> 43:32.456
Night.

43:32.525 --> 43:33.457
Good night.

43:33.526 --> 43:34.925
Here's my fives.

43:34.994 --> 43:35.961
Night.

43:36.028 --> 43:36.960
Good night.

43:37.029 --> 43:39.497
Uh, nice job with
that interview.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.490
Nice talking to you.

43:46.706 --> 43:49.675
So does Kelly's
paperwork look O. K?

43:50.977 --> 43:51.966
Yeah.

43:52.044 --> 43:56.981
Let's announce
we got our cop shooter.

43:57.049 --> 43:58.482
Hasta la vista,
Andy.

43:58.551 --> 44:00.416
Yeah, take it easy,
Harold.

44:00.486 --> 44:01.418
Yeah.

44:01.487 --> 44:02.613
See you, Loo.

44:02.688 --> 44:04.121
Hey, good job, Harold.

44:04.190 --> 44:06.624
John Kelly did
some good job.

44:06.692 --> 44:08.626
He's some damn good cop.

44:08.694 --> 44:09.956
Night.

44:10.029 --> 44:13.192
Why don't you people just
put on cheerleading outfits?

44:13.266 --> 44:17.726
Tough to fire someone who just
brought down a cop killer.

44:19.105 --> 44:20.197
Night, Andy.

44:20.273 --> 44:21.865
Yeah. Good night.

44:23.576 --> 44:25.203
Carlin confessed.

44:25.278 --> 44:26.973
Yeah.

44:27.046 --> 44:29.173
Ahh, that poor woman.

44:29.248 --> 44:32.115
Yeah.

44:32.185 --> 44:35.211
So, uh, did you
figure out

44:35.288 --> 44:37.722
that new place
for us to eat?

44:37.790 --> 44:41.191
Why don't we go
to my place, and I'll cook?

44:41.260 --> 44:44.195
Nah. I don't want
to put you out.

44:44.263 --> 44:46.697
But you want
to marry me.

44:46.766 --> 44:47.926
Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.833
Do you see anything
strange about that?

44:51.971 --> 44:53.268
No.

44:53.339 --> 44:56.740
I mean, eventually,
we'd start eating at home.

44:56.809 --> 44:59.141
What's your point?

44:59.212 --> 45:02.670
Andy, when you
proposed...

45:02.748 --> 45:06.275
I got the feeling that you
thought if we were married...

45:06.352 --> 45:07.683
it would fix something.

45:07.753 --> 45:09.516
I don't want
to get married

45:09.589 --> 45:11.181
to fix something.

45:11.257 --> 45:12.690
In other words,
you're saying no.

45:12.758 --> 45:14.191
I'm not saying no...

45:14.260 --> 45:17.058
but I do think we need
to get comfortable

45:17.129 --> 45:18.187
with each other.

45:18.264 --> 45:20.562
Comfortable.

45:20.633 --> 45:23.431
I intend to get married...

45:23.502 --> 45:29.031
and I don't want anyone else
in my life right now but you.

45:29.108 --> 45:32.566
I want us to get there.
We're not there yet.

45:32.645 --> 45:33.577
Yeah. O.K.

45:34.647 --> 45:35.579
Look...

45:38.284 --> 45:40.718
I'm hungry.

45:40.786 --> 45:43.778
So just come over
for dinner, O. K?

45:43.856 --> 45:46.416
Have you already
got food there?

45:46.492 --> 45:48.722
No, I'll have to shop...

45:48.794 --> 45:51.763
but I go shopping
all the time.

45:51.831 --> 45:55.858
I meant to say maybe we could
go shopping together.

45:59.705 --> 46:01.229
Sure.
