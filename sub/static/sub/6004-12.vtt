00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:06.107 --> 00:08.440
From the belt to the plate!

00:08.442 --> 00:10.442
[grunts]

00:10.444 --> 00:13.612
Come on, Drax, you shouldn't
have even swung at that.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.180
It was a ball.

00:15.182 --> 00:19.018
It is still a ball, Quill.
You told me to hit it.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.153
I am Groot.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.554
Yeah, Groot's right.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.556
You told us we was
gonna make a diamond.

00:24.558 --> 00:28.227
It's a baseball diamond, Rocket,
where you play baseball.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.362
And you hit the ball
unless it's a bad pitch.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.298
Then it's a ball, but only if
you don't try to hit it.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.567
I do not understand this game.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.170
Game? Game?!

00:38.172 --> 00:40.205
Baseball is more than a game.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.740
It's a way of life.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.710
In fact, it once saved my life.

00:44.712 --> 00:48.914
Quill, the nav point from
your star map? It's moving.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.516
Toward us. Hang on, Gamora.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.484
I'm about to impart
some Earth wisdom here.

00:52.486 --> 00:56.688
[Gamora] Now the nav point is
sending out a distress beacon.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.259
Hello? Earth wisdom.
There was this dog, okay?

01:00.261 --> 01:03.429
Lived right next to the field
and he was huge.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.864
Bigger than that one? [Shouts]

01:05.866 --> 01:08.267
It's okay. I got this.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.535
I'm super good with dogs.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.503
They can smell fear, okay?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.072
Everybody just stay calm.
[shouting]

01:13.074 --> 01:15.040
[grunting] [crashing]

01:15.042 --> 01:17.743
[sighs] Why doesn't
anybody listen to me?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.044
[barks]

01:19.046 --> 01:21.080
There's the mutt. Grab him!

01:21.082 --> 01:22.314
[Quill] Huh?

01:23.684 --> 01:24.683
[shouts]

01:24.685 --> 01:26.118
[sniffing]

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
Hey! Get away from
my boom box, Fido!

01:28.122 --> 01:30.856
Here, boy. Hey.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.158
[panting] Go fetch.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.968
[barks] Look out!

01:45.639 --> 01:50.375
Well, at least we don't have to
play that stupid game no more.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.290 --> 02:05.324
[growling]

02:05.326 --> 02:06.892
Come back with my ball!

02:06.894 --> 02:09.961
Forget your stupid ball.
Quill, wait!

02:09.964 --> 02:12.131
We need to figure out where
we've been teleported.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.166
It's not about the ball.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.968
It's about how I'm supposed
to be the leader of this team,

02:15.970 --> 02:18.070
but no one listens
to a word I say.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.639
No one listens to you?
If you had listened to me,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.741
you would have known about
the nav point moving,

02:22.743 --> 02:24.443
and about the distress call.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.345
There was a distress call?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.752
All right, so who's in distress?

02:33.754 --> 02:36.394
I mean, there's nobody here but a
giant, slobbering baseball thief!

02:38.859 --> 02:39.992
[barks]

02:39.994 --> 02:43.662
What is it, boy?
Huh, what is it?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.631
Timmy in the well? [Whines]

02:45.633 --> 02:47.533
You know, on Earth
that's totally hilarious.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.801
I can see why you don't go back.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.938
Okay, ignoring the snide remark.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.007
Checking out the glowing
pod thingies.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.110
Whoa. A sleeping princess.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.712
Huh. Just like in a fairy tale.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.281
Ooh. [Grunts]

03:02.283 --> 03:03.582
[Quill shouting]

03:03.584 --> 03:06.385
You would dare take such
liberties with Medusa,

03:06.387 --> 03:07.819
Queen of the Inhumans?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.721
Hey, it was just
one little kiss.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.523
[grunting]

03:11.525 --> 03:15.160
Let go of me, beast! [Grunting]

03:15.162 --> 03:18.697
I am a married woman. My husband
would have words with you.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.732
I won't say anything
if you won't.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.701
Neither will he.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.906
All right, knuckleheads.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.842
I followed the tracking beacon
in Quill's helmet this far.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.878
But I can't get
a solid fix on it now.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.180
Quill! Gamora!

03:35.182 --> 03:37.816
I am Groo-oot.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.986
Forget it, guys. This place
looks like a ghost town.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.655
Drax the Destroyer
does not fear ghosts.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.592
[groans] I mean it's empty.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.427
Like your head.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.766
I am Groot. [Rocket] Good point.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.403
Maybe we can empty this city
of a few treasures.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.505
[sighing] What?

04:00.507 --> 04:03.375
It's not like there's anybody
here to use the stuff.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.677
We cannot take these statues.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.714
You're absolutely right, Drax.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.349
[grunting]

04:10.351 --> 04:12.584
We gotta find out
what they're made of first.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.119
[chuckles] Don't want
to waste our time

04:14.121 --> 04:15.921
hauling around a bunch
of worthless rocks.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.690
[clinking]

04:18.692 --> 04:20.858
I am Groot. [Shouting]

04:20.861 --> 04:23.795
[screaming]
Hey, these rocks are alive.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.464
[grunting]

04:25.466 --> 04:26.965
[Rocket] And they're
pretty cheesed off!

04:26.967 --> 04:29.534
[all growling] [grunts]

04:29.536 --> 04:32.304
And I will remove
the remainder of their cheese.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.706
[all grunting]

04:34.708 --> 04:36.308
I am Groot.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.043
I am Groot, I am Groot,
I am Groot!

04:39.713 --> 04:41.480
Got my own problems here.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.748
Whoa!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.816
Now I'd like some answers.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.386
Who sent you? Are you Kree?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.820
Nobody sent us.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.389
We were answering
your distress call

04:50.391 --> 04:53.292
when that slobbering sofa
over there shanghaied us.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.626
And he took my ball!

04:54.628 --> 04:56.795
Is this true, Lockjaw?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.297
[grumbling]

04:58.299 --> 05:00.065
But I sent no distress signal.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.099
[both shouting]

05:01.101 --> 05:02.801
[both grunting]

05:02.803 --> 05:05.070
Somebody did.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.640
[man] Alpha primitives.
Cease this attack.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.910
Back! Back, my loyal subjects.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.747
Oh, this has all been
a terrible misunderstanding.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.617
I am so very sorry
about all this.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.752
I was expecting someone else.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.923
I am Maximus, the Magnificent.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.592
Supreme Leader of the Inhumans.

05:27.594 --> 05:31.196
[Rocket]
Okay. What's an Inhuman?

05:31.198 --> 05:34.766
Many thousands of years ago
on a planet called Earth,

05:34.768 --> 05:38.203
the Kree experimented on
a tribe of prehistoric humans.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.205
They... Wait, you're from Earth?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.974
Great, tell her about baseball.
It's super important, right?

05:42.976 --> 05:46.378
I know nothing of baseball.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.281
Okay, she is not from Earth.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.717
[Maximus]
These experimental Inhumans

05:51.719 --> 05:55.120
became hyper-evolved,
genetically superior.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.156
They were feared and hated
by their primitive brethren,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.292
and forced to live in seclusion.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.128
Those were my ancestors

06:03.130 --> 06:06.698
who built this
marvelous city, Attilan.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.369
It was then that they discovered
the Terrigen Crystals

06:10.371 --> 06:12.871
in the caverns beneath the city.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.740
Exposure to the crystals

06:14.742 --> 06:17.242
gave us each unique
and amazing powers.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.846
Like the hair thing?
Like the hair thing.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.982
Hidden from the world,
we Inhumans lived in peace.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.251
Until three decades ago,
when the plague appeared.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.719
[both] Plague?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.354
[mumbling]

06:29.356 --> 06:33.658
The plague slowly turns our
bodies into Terrigen Crystal.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.662
It only affects Inhumans.
Including Lockjaw.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.664
[panting]

06:39.666 --> 06:42.067
Aw, who's a poor puppy!

06:42.069 --> 06:46.605
You've seen the effect on our servant
class, the Alpha Primitives.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.241
The plague made them
nearly indestructible.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.043
Their strength increased
a hundred-fold.

06:52.045 --> 06:56.248
But for the rest of us, the
plague would prove quite fatal.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.918
Until now. After years
of tireless work,

06:59.920 --> 07:03.422
I, Maximus, have found a cure.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.090
Soon I will have
enough of the serum

07:05.092 --> 07:07.359
to save the rest of my family.

07:07.361 --> 07:11.930
Even Black Bolt,
my poor mute brother.

07:15.369 --> 07:18.136
Since it was the Kree
who created the Inhumans,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.806
we hoped they might
help us find a cure.

07:20.808 --> 07:24.776
We placed ourselves in stasis and
launched our city into the stars.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.547
[gasps] My husband.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.382
The king is missing.

07:30.384 --> 07:33.452
And so is his rat
of a brother, Maximus.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.954
Lockjaw, to Maximus' lab.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.889
[barks] Wait.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.825
Who's Maximus again? [Barks]

07:43.063 --> 07:44.996
[Rocket]
Hey, it's Quill and Gammy.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.898
And the kidnapping pooch.

07:46.900 --> 07:51.002
And some lady having
a seriously weird hair day.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.105
[growling] Maximus the Mad.
Where is Black Bolt?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.608
What have you done with
my husband the king?

07:56.610 --> 08:00.278
I thought you was the king.
By rights, I should be.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.681
I isolated the Terrigen plague.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.483
I found the cure.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.919
While this one said nothing,
did nothing.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.789
Until he himself
succumbed to the threat.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.024
Black Bolt is unworthy
of the crown.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.595
Maximus is the true savior
of the Inhumans.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.998
Oo-kay. Good luck with that.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.801
We're just gonna take
our friends and head out.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.470
You found a cure
but you refused to share it

08:25.472 --> 08:27.439
unless you were crowned
Supreme Ruler.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.374
We would rather
succumb to the plague

08:29.376 --> 08:31.676
than yield to your insane
grab for power.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.514
You deceived us.
Why would you do such a thing?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.549
It was nothing personal, friend.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.317
I had to do something
to keep you from interfering

08:39.318 --> 08:42.888
until I completed
my greatest invention.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.556
Behold!

08:44.558 --> 08:50.195
[Maximus] Complete and
total mind control.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.130
[laughing maniacally]

08:52.132 --> 08:54.900
Obey me, my brother.
Destroy them!

08:54.902 --> 08:56.668
Destroy them all!

08:56.670 --> 08:59.671
You will not harm my friends!

08:59.673 --> 09:01.540
[Drax grunting] [explosion]

09:01.542 --> 09:02.641
[Drax] No!

09:02.643 --> 09:03.975
[Drax grunts]

09:06.346 --> 09:09.648
[laughing]

09:09.650 --> 09:13.451
Finally, one of you
will listen to what I say.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.656
So, you're the hair lady's
husband, huh?

09:17.658 --> 09:20.325
For the record, dude,
I never touched her.

09:21.495 --> 09:24.763
[Maximus] Black Bolt, obey
your brother and true king.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.131
Destroy them!

09:28.869 --> 09:31.570
[grunting]

09:31.572 --> 09:35.106
Bravo! Well done, my puppet.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.409
[Medusa] Fight Maximus'
control, my husband.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.178
No mind is as resilient
as yours.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.013
No will so strong.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.716
Okay, you guys
draw Black Bolt away.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.518
I'll take out Maximus and
get the mind control gizmo.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.886
[whines]

09:47.888 --> 09:49.955
Or you two could just
ignore my awesome plan,

09:49.957 --> 09:52.090
and totally do
your own thing, as usual.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.061
[grunting]

09:56.063 --> 09:57.963
[groans]

09:57.965 --> 10:00.599
[laughing]

10:01.969 --> 10:03.635
Hey, puppy, puppy!

10:03.637 --> 10:06.771
Can you zap me over behind Maximus, huh?
Can you, boy?

10:09.309 --> 10:10.709
[yells, grunts]

10:10.711 --> 10:12.644
[shouts] Didn't Medusa tell you?

10:12.646 --> 10:16.047
We Inhumans are stronger,
faster, smarter.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.450
Far superior to any human.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.419
I'm warning you.
Don't make me open this box.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.722
There's a weapon inside that
can wipe out the whole city.

10:23.724 --> 10:27.058
Really? Oh, this I must see.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.393
Open it, open it!

10:28.395 --> 10:30.295
No, okay, you're not getting it.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.397
We'll all be
vaporized instantly.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.233
How exciting! Open it, now!

10:35.235 --> 10:37.168
[groans]

10:39.840 --> 10:43.575
[screams] My eyes! My eyes!

10:43.577 --> 10:46.745
See? See, that's what happens to
people who don't listen to me.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.580
Now let's see about that helmet.

10:48.582 --> 10:51.483
Quill, quit feeding the plant
the Cosmic Seed energy.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.218
[Groot growling]

10:57.090 --> 10:59.090
[electronic whirring]

11:01.428 --> 11:03.328
[groans]

11:03.330 --> 11:05.530
It's not your fault, my love.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.999
You weren't under
your own control.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.302
[Groot groans] I am Groot.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.639
Maximus got away, but I got
his mind control gizmo.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.922
Are you all right, Black Bolt?

11:19.112 --> 11:22.047
Eesh, not much of
a conversationalist, huh?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.716
Still, we should get the other
mind control piece off your head.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.151
Don't touch it!

11:26.153 --> 11:29.154
My husband's power
is in his voice.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.656
That is why he dares not speak.

11:31.658 --> 11:35.193
Even the slightest whisper
can level a city.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.062
[echoing] Aaah.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.835
He has trained all his life
to remain silent,

11:43.837 --> 11:46.971
but the antenna helps him
focus his energies.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.406
If it were damaged...

11:48.408 --> 11:50.842
Then say hello to oblivion.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.978
Got it.
Nobody touches the antenna.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.980
[groans]

11:55.982 --> 11:58.650
The plague. It is spreading.

11:58.652 --> 12:02.187
When you opened the box it made
the crystals grow like crazy.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.689
It made the... That's awesome!

12:04.691 --> 12:07.425
I do not think that word means
what you think it means.

12:07.427 --> 12:11.262
No, hear me out. If Cosmic Seed
energy made the plague worse,

12:11.264 --> 12:13.398
then removing it
should make it better.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.167
And we all know my boom box
absorbs Cosmic Seed energy.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.536
See? Awesome...

12:18.538 --> 12:19.771
Aah!

12:19.773 --> 12:22.073
[Quill] ...ly disappointing.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.043
Okay. Wait, unless
there's another source

12:25.045 --> 12:26.711
of Cosmic Seed energy nearby.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.080
As in the Cosmic Seed itself.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.515
It could be right here
under our feet.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.917
Oh, flarg! Not this again.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.220
But if I'm right,
then all we have to do

12:35.222 --> 12:36.921
is put the Seed
back in the boom box.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.090
Box sucks up
all the Seed energy,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.259
crystals stop growing
out of control...

12:41.261 --> 12:43.461
Boom! No more plague.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.630
You've never even
seen the Cosmic Seed.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.198
You don't know
how it would react.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.234
You know, fine.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.202
If you don't want to look for the
Seed, I'll find it on my own.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.005
I'm sick of you guys
not listening to me anyway.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.813
Excuse me, Your Royalness,

13:01.815 --> 13:03.581
but I'm trying
to save your people.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.885
The Guardians of the Galaxy.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.455
This is a pleasant surprise.
Aaah.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.657
I told you I was
expecting someone else.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.426
[Medusa] Maximus!
What have you done?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.762
Just what you wanted.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.498
I have formed an alliance
with the Kree.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.967
I give them an invincible
crystal army,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.904
and in return, Attilan becomes
part of the Kree Empire,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.573
with myself as Supreme Leader,
of course.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.110
[scoffs] Is that what he told you?
He can't do that!

13:32.112 --> 13:34.412
Ronan's an outlaw
even among his own people.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.582
You cut a deal with the one guy in
the galaxy who's crazier than you!

13:37.584 --> 13:40.318
No. No!

13:40.320 --> 13:41.786
Enough of your lies.

13:41.788 --> 13:44.455
Alpha Primitives, attack!

13:44.457 --> 13:47.292
[all growling] [grunting]

13:47.294 --> 13:49.527
That's right.
You want a piece of me?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.096
[shouts] These things
just keep coming.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.098
[all shouting]

13:55.535 --> 13:57.502
[grunts]

14:00.473 --> 14:01.940
[shouts]

14:04.211 --> 14:05.610
[groans]

14:05.612 --> 14:08.847
The plague has weakened us.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.652
[grunts]

14:14.654 --> 14:17.722
You Inhuman.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.693
You cannot hope to overpower
my universal weapon.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.166
Hey! I need that!

14:28.168 --> 14:30.869
I believe this device
belongs to me.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.003
Thank you.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.506
By divine right,
I proclaim myself

14:35.508 --> 14:39.677
Maximus the Magnificent,
Supreme Ruler of the Inhumans.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.747
Accuser Ronan. I hereby swear

14:42.749 --> 14:46.184
eternal loyalty and fealty
to the Kree Empire.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.087
Get out of my sight, you filth.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.189
But I... I don't understand.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.425
You promised me
an invincible army,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.862
and present me with
these abominations!

14:57.864 --> 15:00.698
As Accuser of the Kree Empire,

15:00.700 --> 15:04.202
I declare that
this vile, debased city

15:04.204 --> 15:07.038
be cleansed.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.741
No. You can't do this to me.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.210
I'll make my brother stop you.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.345
With a word, a single syllable,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.347
he will annihilate... [grunts]

15:16.349 --> 15:18.583
[groaning]

15:20.353 --> 15:23.888
Black Bolt,
you will order your pet

15:23.890 --> 15:28.559
to teleport you to the Terrigen
Crystal chamber beneath the city.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.962
And take Quill with you.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.797
What did I do?!

15:32.799 --> 15:36.734
I owe you a...
What did you call it?

15:36.736 --> 15:38.436
Dance-off.

15:38.438 --> 15:43.708
However, I will keep
the Crypto-Cube.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.378
[growling]

15:47.380 --> 15:50.248
As soon as my ship
reaches a safe distance,

15:50.250 --> 15:53.084
I will order Black Bolt
to scream,

15:53.086 --> 15:56.254
ridding the universe
of this unclean city,

15:56.256 --> 16:00.558
and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.239
Let me get this straight.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.908
We're all gonna get
blown to atoms

16:16.910 --> 16:19.911
because Ronan's
gonna make a guy yell?

16:19.913 --> 16:22.747
Maximus, if you give
Black Bolt the cure,

16:22.749 --> 16:26.184
perhaps he'll be strong enough
to fight off the mind control.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.087
[grunting] [shattering]

16:29.089 --> 16:33.157
I'd rather be vaporized than
bow to my brother yet again.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.427
[laughing maniacally] [all gasp]

16:36.429 --> 16:38.329
[grunts]

16:38.331 --> 16:40.832
The Cosmic Seed's
not here either.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.267
Oh, man, now those guys
are never gonna listen to me.

16:43.269 --> 16:49.107
<i>[Ronan] Black Bolt, make the
so-called Star-Lord dance.</i>

16:49.109 --> 16:51.376
No. No, no. No, no, come on.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.444
Your Highness,
you don't want to do this.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.214
You're a sick man, remember?
You should probably rest.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.516
Have you tried chicken soup? No!

16:59.452 --> 17:00.685
[gasps]

17:02.889 --> 17:06.357
[grunting]

17:06.358 --> 17:08.358
Huh. Hey, puppy.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.395
You can zap me
out of here, right?

17:10.396 --> 17:11.863
Come on. Good boy.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.635
[sighs] What's your secret, man?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.971
I mean, everybody listens to you
and you don't even say anything.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.105
Wha...?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.343
[Medusa] The Terrigen
cavern is just ahead.

17:25.345 --> 17:29.013
Our only chance is to remove Black
Bolt's mind control device.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So now you
want to mess with his antenna

17:31.818 --> 17:33.484
and risk blowing us all up?

17:33.486 --> 17:36.888
Oh, I doubt you'll even get
the opportunity to try.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.658
Alpha Primitives. Attack!

17:40.660 --> 17:42.593
[grunting]

17:46.232 --> 17:49.834
Bravo! A front row seat
for the apocalypse.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.369
[laughing]

17:51.371 --> 17:54.939
[Ronan]
That should be far enough.

17:54.941 --> 17:58.076
Now, Black Bolt. Scream.
[echoing]

17:59.746 --> 18:01.946
Black Bolt, listen.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.215
If you have to scream,
just make the dog take you

18:04.217 --> 18:05.583
where you can't hurt anybody.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.228
Dude, just think about
something else.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.530
Like baseball.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.066
Seriously? How can
you people come from Earth

18:22.068 --> 18:23.534
and not know baseball?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.306
[Quill] You had him
fetch me the boom box?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.808
But the energy in here
makes the plague worse.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.479
It'll kill you, which I guess
would save Attilan, but...

18:35.915 --> 18:38.316
[Quill] Wait. You
think it can absorb

18:38.318 --> 18:40.485
the Cosmic Seed energy
from the crystals?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.854
You were listening to me!

19:00.140 --> 19:01.939
The plague.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.307
It's gone.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.276
Huh?

19:05.278 --> 19:08.446
[all groaning]

19:08.448 --> 19:12.083
[shouting]

19:12.085 --> 19:13.751
[all exclaiming]

19:16.289 --> 19:19.624
[Quill] Yeah, I pretty
much saved the day, again.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.359
You're welcome.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.097
Do what you must, my love.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.007
Something is wrong.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.489
Attilan should be
annihilated by now.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.281
Huh?

19:43.283 --> 19:45.383
[whirring]

19:46.686 --> 19:49.120
Never. [Echoing]

20:02.368 --> 20:03.801
Mm.

20:03.803 --> 20:08.472
Ronan will have his revenge!

20:15.682 --> 20:17.582
[Maximus laughing]

20:17.584 --> 20:19.717
Oh, the irony.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.820
Foiled by the great Star-Lord
who can't find what he seeks

20:22.822 --> 20:24.922
with a map and both hands.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.726
The further he goes,
the farther away he gets.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.428
[laughing]

20:30.430 --> 20:31.996
[grunts]

20:31.998 --> 20:34.865
Wait. What did he mean by that?

20:34.867 --> 20:37.735
Come on, Quill.
The guy's a whack job.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.772
[Medusa]
Guardians of the Galaxy,

20:41.774 --> 20:44.442
in gratitude for
all you have done,

20:44.444 --> 20:47.511
we offer you the full
hospitality of the royal palace

20:47.513 --> 20:49.180
for as long as you wish to stay.

20:49.182 --> 20:51.582
That's a really generous offer,
Your Highnesses,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.451
but we're kind of on a mission.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.087
We're following this map
to find this Cosmic Seed thing.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.256
Okay, every other time

20:58.258 --> 21:00.558
the boom box absorbed
Cosmic Seed energy

21:00.560 --> 21:02.793
it showed us a new coordinate
on the map.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.428
This time there's nothing.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.598
We Inhumans find ourselves
at a crossroads as well.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.934
With the plague cured,
we must now decide

21:09.936 --> 21:13.137
whether to return to Earth or
seek out our creators, the Kree.

21:13.139 --> 21:17.074
So your treasure map just
led us to one big dead end.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.710
Where to now? I don't know.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.146
I finally got you all
to listen to me, and...

21:22.148 --> 21:24.315
I don't have anything to say.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.254
[barking] [Quill] Baseball.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.923
See? The dog gets it.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.393
And here's the pitch!
