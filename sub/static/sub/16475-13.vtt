00:01.135 --> 00:03.080
- Attention. I've been asked
to read this statement.

00:03.104 --> 00:06.107
"Two months ago,
Gina Linetti was hit by a bus,

00:06.140 --> 00:09.477
"and the brightest star
in the cosmos was extinguished.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.380
"But today,
like a phoenix from the ashes,

00:12.413 --> 00:15.516
she rises to vanquish"...

00:15.549 --> 00:17.118
This is ten pages.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.119
I can't read it.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.263
Gina's doctor said it was okay

00:19.287 --> 00:20.530
for her to come back
to work today.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.423
Here she is.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.159
- Thank you.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.095
As much pain as I've been in,

00:27.128 --> 00:29.197
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you...

00:29.230 --> 00:32.533
Living in a Gina-less world
for two months.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.835
I'll field some questions now.
Anyone?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.505
- Uh, how long do you have to
wear the... the...

00:37.538 --> 00:40.074
Metal... the head holder...

00:40.108 --> 00:41.175
- It's called a halo.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.577
The doctor said I have to wear
it for another week.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.854
It's drilled into my skull here.

00:44.878 --> 00:49.283
And, yes, I can still hear the
screws squeaking into the bone.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.560
- So what was it like
getting hit by a bus?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.520
- It was awesome.
- Ah, I knew it.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.388
I always wanted
to get hit by a bus.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.391
- Yeah, I mean, I was legally
dead for two full minutes.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.193
- And I met God.
- Tight.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.395
- What does she look like?
- Ethnically ambiguous.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.530
- You took two weeks off

01:02.563 --> 01:04.364
when Kourtney
and Scott Disick broke up.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.243
Are you sure you're ready
to be back at work now?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.377
- What are you saying, Terry?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.370
You think I can't handle
being back yet?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.272
Watch this.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

01:24.285 --> 01:26.254
- Gina Linetti is back, baby!

01:46.274 --> 01:48.609
- Sorry I'm late. I was
on a call with One Police Plaza.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.912
Apparently crime in Brooklyn
is down significantly.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.581
Which means

01:53.614 --> 01:55.549
they'll be permanently closing
one precinct.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.518
- What?
- We celebrated too soon.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.520
- An auditor
will arrive shortly.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.622
He'll evaluate us
on crime stats,

02:01.655 --> 02:03.924
physical plant,
fiscal responsibility.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.260
There are 22 other precincts
in Brooklyn,

02:06.294 --> 02:08.229
so we just don't want to rate
at the bottom.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.506
- Are they gonna be looking
in our desks?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.631
Also, unrelated...

02:10.663 --> 02:12.400
Someone left a bunch of swords
in my desk.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.311
- I have a similar question
about browser histories.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.237
- Just throw your computer away.
- Roger that.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.415
- The auditor will start
by joining Peralta and Santiago

02:18.439 --> 02:19.907
on their gang stakeout
because...

02:19.940 --> 02:21.742
- They're
America's dream couple.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.653
- You need to calm down.
- We're in a workplace.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.546
Because their case
is a good example

02:25.579 --> 02:27.648
of the type of serious crime
that still exists

02:27.681 --> 02:28.916
in our neighborhood.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.518
So... Oh.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.453
Looks like the auditor is here.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.454
- Isn't that Teddy...

02:33.487 --> 02:34.655
- Amy's ex-boyfriend?
- Yep.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.656
- Jake,
didn't you break them up?

02:35.689 --> 02:36.924
- Yep.

02:36.957 --> 02:37.725
- Amy, didn't you tell him
to his face

02:37.758 --> 02:39.193
he was
the most boring man alive?

02:39.227 --> 02:40.504
- Yep.
- This is gonna be awkward.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.595
- Yep.
- We had a good run.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.930
- Let's not panic just yet.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.408
Maybe he doesn't remember us
ruining his life

02:44.432 --> 02:45.542
and stomping all over his heart.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.734
Hey, everyone.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.336
I'm Sergeant Wells.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.770
Jake, Amy, nice to see you.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.272
- Teddy, nice to see you, too.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.716
Excited to have you
in the field with us.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.643
- Good. I just hope
I don't bore you to death.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.411
- Ah, what?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.547
Yeah. What's that?
The crime phone is ringing?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.690
We have to answer it.
Come on, Amy.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.250
- BRB.
- Okay.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.527
- Why'd you have to say
he was boring?

03:03.551 --> 03:04.485
- Because he is boring.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.787
His favorite app
on his phone is "contacts."

03:06.820 --> 03:07.897
- He's gonna shut
this place down,

03:07.921 --> 03:09.666
and we're gonna get shipped off
to separate precincts.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.435
I don't think our relationship
can survive that.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.769
- I mean, even if we
don't work together,

03:12.793 --> 03:13.927
we can still be a couple.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.297
- If I don't see you every day,
I will forget who you are.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.765
I'm like a goldfish.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.567
- Standing
in the briefing room...

03:19.600 --> 03:22.436
A space that is approximately
50 feet by 40 feet.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.406
Actually, you know what?
55 feet by 40 feet.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.676
No, 52 feet by 41 feet.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.820
I'll just look at the blueprints
at the City Planner's office.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.580
Hello, weekend plans.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.782
- Sergeant Wells, have you been
to other precincts yet?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.317
How'd they do?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.727
- Well, you know,
everyone's got their issues.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.819
- That's too bad.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.255
I want all my brothers
in the NYPD to do perfectly.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.832
The Seven-Four is corrupt.
You didn't hear it from me.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.001
- You know what? We're just
looking to eliminate waste.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.328
- I assure you,
you'll find zero waste here.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.696
- Really?
- Because I did notice

03:48.729 --> 03:50.664
during my preliminary
examination

03:50.698 --> 03:53.667
that you recently purchased
a $21,000 copy machine?

03:53.701 --> 03:57.638
- Well, that machine saves money
in terms of man-hours.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.373
Uh, if you excuse me,
Sergeant Wells,

03:59.407 --> 04:00.708
we need to go to the BRB.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.344
It's BRB time.
We're BRB-ing.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.678
- Make space.
- You make space!

04:04.712 --> 04:06.490
This closet is for people
who are freaking out.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.624
- Oh, I'm fully freaking out.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.584
I just experimented with
an unfamiliar acronym in public.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.620
- BRB... what does it even mean?
- Be right back.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.464
- It has the same number
of syllables as the acronym.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.723
What's the point?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.334
- Teddy knows
about the fancy Japanese copier

04:17.358 --> 04:18.326
that C.J. bought...

04:18.358 --> 04:20.119
The one that broke
the first time we used it.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.767
Is it supposed to do that?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.869
It was not supposed to do that.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.771
- Is this where people
are freaking out?

04:30.804 --> 04:31.848
Because we are freaking out.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.683
- Teddy dinged the One-Five
for having roaches.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.309
- So what?
- We don't have roaches.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.410
Our rats ate all of them.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.345
- That's the problem.
- We have rats.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.422
- Right, right, right, right,
that's worse.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.324
- Oh, God, they're gonna shut
this precinct down

04:40.348 --> 04:41.515
and separate me and Jake.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.750
Our friendship is over.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.728
If he doesn't see my face every
day, he'll forget who I am.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.654
He's like a goldfish.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.655
This is all your fault.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.590
You just had to sleep
with Teddy, didn't you?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.558
You couldn't keep it
in your pants.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.393
- Come on, Charles.
- He's right, Santiago.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.061
Your libido
has endangered us all.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.696
Excuse me, guys, coming in.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.731
- Wait. Gina, you sure
you can fit in?

04:57.765 --> 05:00.768
- I'm sorry. Because of my
injury, I can no longer fit in?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.669
- No, I meant physically.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.703
- I'll have you know,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.838
I am physically as strong
as I've ever been...

05:04.872 --> 05:06.607
Stronger even.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.677
I'm Gina Linetti,
and I can do anything, okay?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.845
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.815
Oh, yeah, this is too crowded.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.917
Shouldn't have wasted my speech
on this moment.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.118
- To the evidence room.

05:18.151 --> 05:18.952
You two need to figure out

05:18.986 --> 05:20.588
how to patch things up
with Teddy.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.131
- He's still upset
that I called him boring.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.700
We just have to pretend
that he's interesting.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.435
I got pretty good at it
while we were dating.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.727
We just have to smile and nod

05:26.760 --> 05:28.729
and agree with whatever
he said last.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.398
- Great.
- Hey, wait a minute.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.665
- I'm still not sure

05:31.699 --> 05:33.477
who the second-best "Die Hard"
villain is, though, you know?

05:33.501 --> 05:34.735
Probably Jeremy Irons.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.846
But maybe it's Timothy Olyphant,
or it could be William Atherton.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.606
- Definitely the last one.
- Right?

05:38.639 --> 05:40.441
- No, I really think
it's William Atherton.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.609
- Okay.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.687
- We have to engage him
on topics that he cares about.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.614
Pilsners... he loves talking
about pilsners.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.116
Oh, my God. Just saying the word
gives me PTSD.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.117
- Pilsner-TSD.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.552
- Good one.
- Thanks.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.386
- Pull yourself together

05:52.420 --> 05:53.387
and go out there
and make Teddy feel

05:53.421 --> 05:54.287
like he's the most interesting
man on Earth.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.724
I want him to think
he's Andy Borowitz

05:56.757 --> 05:57.934
- when this is all done.
- On it.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.728
We'll go there and make him feel
like whoever that person is.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.962
Let's go.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.132
- Okay, now what we need to do
is fix that infernal copier.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.767
Jeffords, you did a year abroad
in Tokyo.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.470
Maybe you can figure out
the manual. It's in Japanese.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.748
- I can try, but the only thing
I really remember how to say

06:11.772 --> 06:14.408
is, "Do you have a bigger door
I can enter through?"

06:14.442 --> 06:15.619
- Bring me solutions,
not problems.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.753
Now, what do we do
about the rats?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.145
- Well, lucky for us,

06:18.178 --> 06:20.648
I have recently come into
a lot of wolf urine.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.915
- That's lucky for us how?

06:21.949 --> 06:24.485
- It creates a scent impression
that there are predators nearby.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.620
I've been dousing
Nikolaj's shoes with it

06:26.654 --> 06:27.864
to scare off bullies
at his preschool.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.757
- Did it work?
- No, now they call him pee boy.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.692
He's much worse off.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.495
But wolf urine
definitely scares off rats.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.630
We can use it to herd them
toward the traps.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.466
- What about me?
- Like, what should I do?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.534
- I just thought
maybe you could take it easy.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.878
- It's your first day and...
- I'll have you know,

06:41.902 --> 06:44.772
I am as strong physically
as I have ever been...

06:44.805 --> 06:46.607
- Stronger even.
- You already did this.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.509
- Yeah, I have
short-term amnesia.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.777
I got hit by a bus.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.746
But don't worry. I am as strong
physically as I have ever been...

06:52.780 --> 06:53.614
Stronger even.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.207
- Fine. You can help me
with the copier.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.754
- Detectives have chosen
an adequate location

07:00.788 --> 07:01.889
for their stakeout.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.657
- Teddy, how's it going, my man?

07:03.691 --> 07:05.469
Nice to see you. I'm glad we get
to spend this time together.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.770
- I haven't seen you since...
- You broke me and Amy up.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.028
- Maybe.
- Probably not.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.963
Who can say when people
last saw people?

07:09.997 --> 07:13.667
- Anyway, that's the HQ
for the 8th Street Killas.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.903
We think they're meeting up
with leaders of another gang

07:15.936 --> 07:17.805
to possibly merge organizations.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.739
- Detectives demonstrate

07:18.772 --> 07:20.674
a passable knowledge
of their operation.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.210
- Cool. So, hey, we might be
here for a while.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.813
- Can I offer you a beverage?
- Ooh.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.548
Diet ginger ale...
That is my favorite.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.817
Actually, I shouldn't.
It'll make me all hyper.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.553
- Suit yourself.
- Too bad we're on the job, right?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.063
Could've stocked that thing
with pilsners.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.756
- You like pilsners?
- Are you kidding me?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.990
I kills for the pils.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.826
I'm a total pils-nerd.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.500
- What's your poison...
- German or Bohemian?

07:46.534 --> 07:48.702
- The last one that you said.
- Good choice.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.604
- The last one always is.
- Wow. This is fun.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.040
I could talk with you
about pilsners all day.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.074
- Oh, let's do it.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.809
Of the Bohemians,
what's your fave?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.846
- Scharfen... grelderbrau.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.648
It's new.
Millennials love it.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.691
- Cool.
- Let me make note of that.

08:01.715 --> 08:05.719
Just caught Detectives S and P
in a bald-faced lie.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.521
You don't like pilsners.
You hate pilsners.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.533
You think they're boring,
and you still think I'm boring.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.058
- No. No lie.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.860
Detectives S and P didn't lie.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.828
Detectives S and P no lie.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.132
- Sergeant, please tell me

08:19.166 --> 08:21.535
this malfunctioning copier
isn't gonna sink our precinct.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.612
- I figured out
how to turn it on,

08:22.636 --> 08:25.606
but the screen just shows
a cartoon turtle sobbing.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.716
- Perhaps it's a paper jam.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.585
- And what about when
the little sushi roll comes out

08:28.609 --> 08:30.010
and cuts the turtle's head off?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.278
- Toner issue.
- Why?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.113
Anyway, I started
taking it apart,

08:33.145 --> 08:36.149
but it's been a slow process
for some reason.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.118
- Hey, Captain, I'm glad
you're here to see this.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.553
I'm just about to drink my tea.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.188
Terry.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.631
Can't even tell
I was hit by a bus.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.600
That's how independent I am.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.101
- Well, perhaps Boyle and Diaz

08:54.134 --> 08:56.036
have made more progress
with the rats.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.313
- We've made
absolutely no progress.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.447
It took forever
to bait the traps

08:58.471 --> 09:00.684
because Scully kept eating
the peanut butter out of them.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.676
- You can't prove
it was me, Rosa.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.787
- Now we're gonna use
the wolf urine

09:03.811 --> 09:06.046
to flush the rats out
of the walls and into our traps.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.716
- That's where I come in.
- I'm going up in the ceiling.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.359
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Mobility.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.985
It's a good thing I still have

09:12.019 --> 09:13.621
my sexy-cat costume
from Halloween.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.521
- I really don't think

09:14.554 --> 09:15.565
you were the target audience
for that item.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.025
- There is nothing gendered
about a sexy cat.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.161
Now, please hand me that big jug
of wolf pee I rub on my kid.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.031
- Okay, Teddy, let's not
evaluate rashly here, all right?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.065
It's a misunderstanding.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.667
We're not saying
pilsners are boring.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.368
We're saying
that we are too boring

09:28.401 --> 09:30.237
to appreciate them properly...

09:30.270 --> 09:32.606
- Is what I'm going with.
- Jake, I agree with you.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.317
Pilsners are boring. That's why
I don't drink them anymore.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.043
- Say what now?
- Amy was right.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.978
When we were going together,
I was boring.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.355
It took our breakup
for me to realize that.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.314
- So you're not still mad at me?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.392
- No, no, no, you changed me.
- I found my wild side.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.252
My girlfriend and I do 5Ks now.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.387
We took a two-week trip
to San Diego last year.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
The energy of that place
is electric.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.692
- But back at the precinct,
you said,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.326
"I hope I don't bore you
to death."

09:53.360 --> 09:55.763
That was a joke.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.998
Humor is the tool
of the interesting.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.400
- Right. A tool that you
have clearly mastered.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.369
- Ooh, get this...
- My lady turned me on

10:02.402 --> 10:04.371
to something called
adult coloring books,

10:04.404 --> 10:06.707
which we do at... wait for it...

10:06.740 --> 10:08.308
Jazz brunches.
What?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.378
- Aha. Wow. It's like brunch
is crazy enough on its own,

10:11.411 --> 10:13.113
then you throw jazz in the mix.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.382
It's like, "Why are we even
doing this?"

10:19.419 --> 10:21.388
- Oh, my God, that is...

10:21.421 --> 10:23.724
This is fun. I have not laughed
this much in a long time.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.858
- Twice.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.670
- Reminder... invite Jake and Amy
to jazz brunch tomorrow.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.328
- Uh, reminder...
- We're in.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.006
- Good. But I am actually gonna
email you the invite,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.431
if you could just RSVP to that.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.276
I'd feel better if everyone
had it on their calendars.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.377
- Copy that.
- We all have calendars.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.770
So that'll work out great,
'cause we all have one.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.405
- How's it going
with the copier?

10:38.438 --> 10:39.406
- Not great.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.274
I got through
to customer service,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.376
but I really don't remember
that much Japanese.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.415
- Hey, Captain.
- Update on the rat situation.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.349
Wolf pee's in place,

10:49.382 --> 10:50.459
and the traps are set
in the evidence room.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.786
- I thought we were luring them
into the break room.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.688
- No, Gina needed it
for meditation.

10:54.722 --> 10:58.225
You are strong. You are wise.

10:58.258 --> 11:02.462
You will have your revenge
on all New York City buses.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.064
- Everything else is good?
- Not quite.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.265
We have a Charles situation.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.409
- Well, how stuck
are you, Boyle?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.600
- Completely.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.403
My tail seems to have gotten
knotted around a sprinkler.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.471
I think I can pull it.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.873
- No, that might break the pipe.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.441
The last thing we need
is a flood.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.452
- That's okay. I'm sure
you'll have me down in no time.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.321
- Incorrect. That would make
a hole in the ceiling.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.446
You're there till Monday.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.824
We'll bring you some food
in a bucket.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.315
- Sir, I really think...

11:22.349 --> 11:23.416
- He'll be fine.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.085
- Guava juice, mango juice,

11:25.118 --> 11:25.986
orange juice, of course,

11:26.019 --> 11:29.222
grapefruit juice,
and cranberry juice.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.424
- Jazz brunch sounds insane.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.294
But should we talk
about how efficient and well run

11:34.327 --> 11:35.438
the Nine-Nine is
for a while?

11:35.462 --> 11:36.830
- We got plenty of time
for that.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.664
I'm gonna hit
the little boys' room.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.875
When I get back,
remind me to tell you

11:38.899 --> 11:40.200
all about
the omelet-bar station.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.334
- We will.
- You bet.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.870
- Spoiler alert...

11:42.903 --> 11:44.304
two kinds of bell pepper.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.474
Oh, my God, he's so boring.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.376
- He's so boring.
- Most boring man in America.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.178
- And that's him
trying to be interesting.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.412
That is Spring Break Teddy.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.181
How did you ever date him?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.449
- Oh, no, he has
a really big wiener, doesn't he?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.427
Wait. Don't tell me
if that's true, unless it's not.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.429
No, but then if you don't say
anything, I'll know that it is.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.465
Oh, why aren't you saying
anything about his wiener, Amy?

12:02.489 --> 12:03.390
- Jake.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.192
I don't want to hear
about your ex's wiener.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.302
Just... you're not making me
feel better.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.196
- Why would you do this to me?
- Jake, stop spiraling.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.940
- Every time you shake me,
I see it flopping around.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.200
- Stop. Oh, look,
there's our gang leader.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.836
- Seriously?

12:16.870 --> 12:19.539
Wow. Perfect timing,
successful stakeout.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.374
There's no way
that Sergeant Boring Big Wiener

12:21.408 --> 12:22.876
will shut us down now.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.145
- Shh. I think I hear Teddy.
- You didn't answer.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.479
- Forgot the old phonester.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.415
I like to go through my contacts
while I go pee.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.359
- So you only need to use
one hand... that's great.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.185
- Oh, look,
it was still recording.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.329
- Like, recording recording?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.487
Yeah.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.390
- Oh, this is bad.
- What? What's wrong?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.902
Oh, my God.
It was recording the whole time.

12:38.926 --> 12:39.936
We said all that bad stuff.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.162
Sorry. I was so preoccupied
with the wiener stuff.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.496
Oh, this is bad.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.166
But while I have you,
just stop me.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.971
- I know accepting Teddy's
jazz-brunch invite

12:51.004 --> 12:52.081
was the only way
to get his phone back

12:52.105 --> 12:53.073
and save the Nine-Nine,

12:53.106 --> 12:55.108
but this place
is literally hell.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.255
- She's doing jazz about brunch.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.957
Maybe it's not too late
to get out of here.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.850
We could start a new life
in the country,

13:02.883 --> 13:03.927
maybe open a small bookstore.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.953
- How dare you tempt me
with a small bookstore?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.988
- We need to focus.
- Okay.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.156
- Look, Teddy's over there.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.124
Oh, and he's
in fun, casual wear.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.969
His phone is out on the table,
like it always is,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
because he fears the radiation
will affect his testicles.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.040
- Which are connected
to his average-sized...

13:17.064 --> 13:18.304
- Jake.
- Right. It's misshapen.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.266
That's all that matters.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.476
All right, here's the plan...
We stage a fight.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.003
It escalates, and I flip over
the table in dramatic fashion.

13:23.036 --> 13:23.937
- Do we need the table flip?

13:23.971 --> 13:26.239
- Amy, when the opportunity
presents itself

13:26.273 --> 13:28.976
to flip-a da table,
uh, you flip-a da table.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.253
- And in the chaos,
you grab his phone,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.112
delete the recording,
and we're golden.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.982
- Perfect. All right,
let's stage a fake fight.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.183
This'll be fun, right?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.061
Pretending like we have things
to be mad at each other about.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
- Jake's chronic tardiness,
his slobbiness,

13:40.020 --> 13:41.855
and the fact
that he wasted half the morning

13:41.889 --> 13:42.899
deciding what sneakers
to wear...

13:42.923 --> 13:45.058
Those are just some
of the reasons we're late.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.602
No one cares
about your sneakers, Jake.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.928
- Yeah, very convincing.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.105
- We're just glad
you guys made it.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.273
This is Rachel, my girlfriend.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.098
- Hi.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.967
So Teddy said you guys
had such a blast

13:54.001 --> 13:55.969
- at the stakeout.
- Yes, it was incredible.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.014
Can I really quickly just say
the real reason we were late

13:58.038 --> 13:58.906
was that Amy insisted

13:58.939 --> 14:00.116
on brushing her teeth
for 30 minutes?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.976
- Two minutes or one minute,
58 seconds longer than you did.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.945
Anyway, can we please
just talk to our friends?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.880
- Wow. Fine.
- Fine.

14:06.914 --> 14:07.747
- So, Rachel...
- Hmm?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.383
- How did you guys meet?
- Oh.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.119
Such a wild story.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.654
So I was on an elevator...

14:14.687 --> 14:17.457
and so was Teddy.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.227
- Oh, that's the whole story.
- I think it's romantic.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.963
I remember when our relationship
had magic moments like that

14:22.996 --> 14:24.064
before it went stale.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.265
- Stale?
- Mm.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.667
- Okay, you want
some action, Jackson?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.270
Well, how about I make a scene?

14:30.303 --> 14:31.638
Whoa.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.674
- What are you doing?
- Flip-a-ing de table.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.111
- It's bolted down.
- Oh, what a shock.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.679
You tried something and failed.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.114
- Okay, you know what?
- That's it.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.050
I'm gonna slide it right off!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.253
I am so sorry.
I got carried away.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.088
I will now clean this up
entirely by myself.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.390
- No...
- No, please keep your eyes

14:50.423 --> 14:53.693
on me as I make
this sincere apology.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.263
I am sorry.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.999
- It's okay. Something crazy
always happens at jazz brunch.

14:59.032 --> 14:59.899
It's the Wild West.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.402
- Oh, man, Teddy,
look what happened.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.005
Your phone landed
directly in this glass of OJ.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.074
- That seems almost impossible.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.117
- "Almost" being the key word,

15:08.141 --> 15:10.010
but it happened for real,
and we all know it.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.144
There you go.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.080
- That's it.
- You've gone too far.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.948
I am storming off now.

15:14.982 --> 15:18.351
- No, you've gone too far,
and I'm storming off now!

15:18.385 --> 15:22.122
- There's something
I'd like to show you, Captain.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.029
- Terry... crushed... it.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.330
It works!

15:30.363 --> 15:33.100
- I've never been more proud of
you for anything in your life.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.502
- I mean, I've solved
a lot of cases for you.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.712
- And yet crime has continued.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.880
- I think we've done it,
Captain.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.207
Just heard the traps go off.
Want to come check with us?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.975
- Of course. How's Boyle doing?
- He's fine.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.077
You know how quickly he submits
to his environment.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.079
- Where are the rats?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.348
- There's blood everywhere.
- This is a horror scene.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.150
- They must've chewed
themselves free.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.327
- Detective Diaz,
what was in that box?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.386
- It's from a closed case
in 1986,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.564
when they busted the guy
that dealt to the New York Mets.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.724
- My God, those rats have eaten
the purest cocaine

15:57.757 --> 15:59.126
in the history of this city.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.760
- They know no fear or pain.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.196
And look!
They're back in the walls.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.065
Boyle!

16:05.098 --> 16:07.300
- Ah! The rats chewed
through the sprinkler pipe.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.069
- They're coked up.
- Get out of there.

16:09.102 --> 16:09.869
- They think I'm a cat.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.172
- Boyle, be careful
of the ceiling.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.306
Submit to them!

16:13.340 --> 16:14.541
- Tell Jake I never panicked.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.076
Aah!

16:18.611 --> 16:20.547
- My copier!
- My precinct!

16:20.580 --> 16:22.149
- Charles!

16:22.182 --> 16:23.416
Charles?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.286
- Aah! They survived the fall!

16:26.319 --> 16:27.320
Run!

16:27.354 --> 16:30.057
- That was fun. We're really
good at fake fighting.

16:30.090 --> 16:30.857
And you were amazing
at coming up

16:30.890 --> 16:32.292
with all that stuff
to be mad about.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.294
- Yep, totally,
I just said all that stuff

16:34.327 --> 16:36.296
to save the precinct,
and that's all.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.232
- Oh, my God. You don't
actually care about my sneakers.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.300
- No!

16:40.333 --> 16:42.435
I care about them deeply.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.104
They're all so different.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.372
- Okay.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.041
- Hey, guys, it's Teddy
from jazz brunch.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.042
- Hey, Teddy.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.043
It's Teddy from jazz brunch.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.187
- Why is he here?
- I don't know.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.355
But the fake fight's back on.

16:52.379 --> 16:56.116
So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch
and your stupid sneakers!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.793
- If you don't like my shoes,
you can just tell me.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.053
- Hi. Can I talk to you guys
about something?

17:00.087 --> 17:00.953
- Actually, Teddy,
this is not a good time.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.098
We're still having
a pretty big fight.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.125
- Well, I think what I'm about
to say may solve things.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.569
- Amy, I'm still in love with you.
- What?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.560
- What?
- What?

17:07.594 --> 17:08.627
- Uh-oh.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.034
Jazz.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.138
- Okay. Okay, everybody
just calm down

17:19.172 --> 17:20.172
and take a deep breath.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.415
What the hell is going on, man?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.686
- Yeah, what the hell
is going on?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.445
- You've got a girlfriend.
- I know.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.115
- And she's fine.
- Thanks.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.416
- Sorry.
- I was really planning

17:29.449 --> 17:30.850
on you being
in the cab during this.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.228
- Okay,
that wouldn't make it better.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.120
- No.
- Amy, I'm just...

17:33.153 --> 17:34.221
I'm not over you yet,

17:34.254 --> 17:35.755
and I would've never said
anything,

17:35.788 --> 17:37.624
because I thought
you and Jake were happy,

17:37.657 --> 17:38.767
but after seeing you
at jazz brunch,

17:38.791 --> 17:40.836
- I think I might've been wrong.
- Don't read into that.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.130
That was a freak argument.
We are very happy.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.697
- Amy, we have
all the same interests.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.771
We have so much chemistry.

17:45.798 --> 17:46.833
When we're together,

17:46.866 --> 17:49.136
it's like, no matter
where we are, it's San Diego.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.879
- I feel compelled to tell you
that San Diego's terrible.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.272
- I'm gonna lay it
all on the line.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.107
Amy Santiago...

17:54.141 --> 17:56.209
will you marry me?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.177
- What?
- What?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.145
- Okay, really, could you stay
in the cab?

17:58.178 --> 17:59.788
I'm sorry.
I'll be right there. I promise.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.190
Or maybe I won't.
What's your answer?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.183
- Teddy, I don't want to be
with you.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.594
- But you want to be with him?
- You guys have nothing in common.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.854
- Oh, yeah?
- Tell that to William Atherton...

18:07.887 --> 18:09.289
The man we both consider to be

18:09.322 --> 18:10.857
the second-best
"Die Hard" villain.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.192
She meant it.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
- And also, yes,
we are different people,

18:14.627 --> 18:16.296
but I love that about us.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.864
I love that Jake's
a little messy

18:17.897 --> 18:20.600
and that he cares so much
about his dumb sneakers

18:20.633 --> 18:23.203
and he doesn't get stressed out
about calendars.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.838
- Or flossing my teeth.
- No, the non-flossing is crazy.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.207
- Copy that, and I love you.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.208
- I'm just so confused.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.885
Your fight was like something
out of a movie.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.179
- Teddy...
- No.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.289
- I have to tell you the truth.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.781
- No. Amy is dying.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.648
She has one month to live.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.584
Marrying her would be
a waste of time.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.162
- Jake and I were only
pretending to fight

18:39.186 --> 18:40.753
so that we could destroy
your phone.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.156
While we were on the stakeout
and you were in the bathroom,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.292
we said you were
the most boring man in America,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.693
and your phone recorded it.

18:46.726 --> 18:47.860
I'm sorry.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.173
We didn't want you to get mad
at us and fail the precinct.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.832
- Wow.
- You guys are the worst.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.610
- Well, you just proposed
in front of your girlfriend,

18:54.634 --> 18:55.702
so potato, po-tah-to.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.270
- Amy, I loved you.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.316
All right,
I'm ready to go, Rachel.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.808
Should we hit up
the Tenement Museum?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.176
No!

19:03.210 --> 19:04.744
- I talked to NYPD facilities

19:04.777 --> 19:06.589
to see if they could get
an emergency cleanup crew

19:06.613 --> 19:07.714
out to us this afternoon.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.217
I received
their standard response.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.786
- This is on you, Boyle.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.964
You couldn't just suck it up
and let a few dozen crazed rats

19:15.988 --> 19:17.524
eat you until
their hearts exploded?

19:17.557 --> 19:18.658
- Don't blame Boyle.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.968
The rats only got
into the cocaine

19:19.992 --> 19:21.928
because you put the traps
in the evidence room.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.706
- We were gonna use the break
room, but Gina was in there,

19:23.730 --> 19:26.299
and she got hit by a damn bus,
so nobody can say no to her.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.734
- That's it.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.936
Nobody can say no to her.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.275
Answer's still no.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.311
- Right, but maybe you should
speak to my colleague first.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.283
- Hi.
- I got hit by a bus.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.286
- Wow.
- This place looks amazing.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.855
- Yes, thanks to Gina.
- She's responsible for all of it.

19:48.888 --> 19:49.922
She's an inspiration.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.291
- Thank you, Captain.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.925
You have permission
to share my story.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.994
- So how'd it go
with Sergeant Wells?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.863
- Let's see.
- He proposed to Amy.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.232
She said no, and then
his girlfriend dumped him.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.976
- Terry's getting nervous.
- It's worse than it sounds.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.835
There was
a jazz brunch involved.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.070
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.973
Look, all we can do is hope
that Sergeant Wells handles this

20:07.006 --> 20:09.842
like a professional and respects
the uniform that we all wear.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.912
- Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.615
It's me, the most boring man
in America.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.760
- Well, to be the most anything
in America is pretty good.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.918
I mean, it's a big country.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.621
- Teddy, we are so sorry.
- No, you don't have to be.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.755
It's okay.
I get it.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.591
I am boring.
I'm owning it now.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.768
- Sergeant Wells, I understand

20:25.792 --> 20:27.303
that you're upset
for personal reasons,

20:27.327 --> 20:29.962
but we're hoping that you'll
give us a fair evaluation.

20:29.996 --> 20:30.830
- I will not...

20:30.863 --> 20:32.865
'cause I'm not gonna
write one at all.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.000
I'm recusing myself.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.936
- Oh.
- That is so sweet.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.905
Thank you for being
such a good guy, Teddy.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.008
- Okay. I can read between
the lines, and I love you, too.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.710
Amy Santiago, will you...

20:43.743 --> 20:45.278
- No! Get up!
- Come on!

20:45.312 --> 20:48.014
- Well, for what it's worth,
your precinct is immaculate.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.883
I'm sure that your new auditor,
Lieutenant Hopkins,

20:50.917 --> 20:52.285
will be very impressed.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.854
- Veronica Hopkins?
- That's the one.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.023
- Well, the good news is,

20:57.056 --> 20:58.358
Amy has not dated her.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.394
- No, but I did,
and she hates me.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.763
- Why can't any of you keep it
in your pants?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.365
Hello, Nine-Nine.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.367
I'm Lieutenant Hopkins.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.035
Hello, Terry Jeffords.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.371
Come here
and give an old friend a hug.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.341
- Hey.
- So good to see you.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.344
- I'm shutting
the Nine-Nine down,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.912
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.049
Oh!

21:23.082 --> 21:25.918
This place is fantastic.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.054
This is gonna be fun.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.090
- She seems nice.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.292
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
