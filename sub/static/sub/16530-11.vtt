00:06.140 --> 00:06.274
.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.208
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.841 --> 00:08.842
sexually based offenses

00:08.876 --> 00:11.412
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.115
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.148 --> 00:16.084
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.117 --> 00:17.418
are members of an elite squad

00:17.451 --> 00:19.353
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.523
These are their stories.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.426
[crowd noise]

00:25.459 --> 00:28.129
players: [overlapping chatter]

00:28.162 --> 00:30.164
- Come on, let's go.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.801
[overlapping chatter]

00:33.834 --> 00:36.137
- Kyle, go, go, come on!

00:36.170 --> 00:37.205
Move, move, move, Kyle!
There you go!

00:37.238 --> 00:39.173
Move, move, move, move!

00:39.207 --> 00:40.574
- Kyle, Kyle!
- Come on, Kyle!

00:40.608 --> 00:43.611
[crowd commotion]

00:44.578 --> 00:47.148
[buzzer]

00:47.181 --> 00:50.118
[crowd commotion]
[overlapping shouting]

00:54.422 --> 00:56.424
- Oh, just what I need.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.826
Jack pouting around the house
all weekend.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.162
- Oh, it's--it really
wasn't his fault.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.663
- That's right. Jim always says,
you win as a team,

01:02.696 --> 01:06.634
you lose as a team.
- That's right.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.169
- Damn it. What was that?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.438
We were supposed to be better
than St. Lawrence.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.339
- Let's hope they can
turn it around

01:11.372 --> 01:14.342
before Rockville Center
on Wednesday.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.177
- Poor Jack--
he'll be beside himself.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.179
- He shouldn't have had the puck
in the first place.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.513
I mean, Kyle had
his man beat.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.581
He should have shot it.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.151
Is he afraid of scoring goals?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.286
Hey, hey! All right, Whitecaps!
- Come on, Whitecaps!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.587
- Come on, Whitecaps!
- All right!

01:26.620 --> 01:29.123
Let's put this one
behind you, now.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.192
[overlapping shouts
of encouragement]

01:31.225 --> 01:34.228
What do you say, Jackie boy?
Heads up, now!

01:34.262 --> 01:37.165
[overlapping shouting]
- Jack, honey, you did great!

01:37.198 --> 01:39.300
Okay, buddy!

01:42.270 --> 01:43.604
- All right, listen up.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.140
I'm not gonna say
much more about that game.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.276
We all know what we need to do.

01:48.309 --> 01:52.346
We got practice tomorrow,
here at noon.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.648
Come ready to work.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.151
- Are you serious?

01:57.185 --> 01:58.486
You missed a wide-open shot!

01:58.519 --> 02:00.721
- Can't believe you choked.
You suck, Wilson.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.157
- Hey, enough.
- But Kyle,

02:03.191 --> 02:04.492
he missed a wide-open shot!
- I don't care.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.594
I said that's enough!

02:06.627 --> 02:09.563
[dramatic music]

02:09.597 --> 02:11.632
*

02:11.665 --> 02:13.267
- I don't understand
why you always have to

02:13.301 --> 02:14.368
be the last one out.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.337
You move like molasses.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.306
Honey, what's wrong?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.507
Did you get hurt
during the game?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.442
- I'm fine.
- All right.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.245
Clearly, this requires
your father's expertise.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.315
You can talk to him about it
when you get home.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.949
Hey, do you wanna stop
by the market

02:28.982 --> 02:30.318
for a Creamline shake?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.485
[thud]
Uhh--

02:31.519 --> 02:34.222
Oh, God--Jack!

02:36.624 --> 02:39.493
Oh, God,
where is that coming--

02:39.527 --> 02:41.195
Oh, my God.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.530
Jack!
Okay, oh, my God.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.365
Oh, my God.
All right, Jack.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.633
Come on.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.636
[dark music]

02:48.669 --> 02:50.638
*

02:50.671 --> 02:52.406
- Hey. What do we got?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.941
- The victim's name
is Jack Wilson,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.444
he's 13, he plays for
the New York City Whitecaps.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.578
- Which is--
- The best youth

02:57.611 --> 02:58.679
hockey program in the state.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.481
Now Jack's team had
a game this morning,

03:00.514 --> 03:03.251
but they lost after he missed
a last-second shot.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.318
Now his mother noticed
he was bleeding

03:04.352 --> 03:06.387
in the parking lot afterwards,
drove him over here.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
- You talk to the doctor?
- Yeah.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.557
He said there was tearing
in his rectum

03:09.590 --> 03:11.359
caused by a blunt instrument.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.560
Like a...

03:12.593 --> 03:13.594
hockey stick.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.429
Sounds like a hazing.

03:15.463 --> 03:19.333
- No, that sounds like
sexual assault.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.402
- [sighs]

03:23.837 --> 03:26.807
[dramatic music]

04:10.384 --> 04:10.518
.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.118
- It wasn't that big a deal.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.821
- John Francis Wilson,
you tell these officers

04:13.854 --> 04:15.323
who did it this instant.
- Mrs. Wilson,

04:15.356 --> 04:16.824
I-I understand
that you're upset.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.760
But it's probably best
if we take the lead.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.497
So, Jack, can you tell us
what happened?

04:23.531 --> 04:25.466
- I don't know.

04:25.499 --> 04:29.002
- Look, I understand
that this is really hard.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.940
But it's really important,
so do you know who hurt you?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.475
- I don't remember.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.876
- Okay, but somebody
did hurt you.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.045
- No, I just fell.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.080
- Don't be ridiculous.
The doctor said his--

04:40.113 --> 04:43.351
- Hang on, hang on.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.519
Where'd you fall?
- On the ice, during the game.

04:45.553 --> 04:50.458
- You hurt yourself like that
by falling on the ice?

04:50.491 --> 04:53.427
- So Jack...

04:53.461 --> 04:54.662
we don't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.030
So if you don't wanna talk now,
we can come back later, okay?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.899
- Jack? How you feeling, pal?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.768
- I wanna go home, Dad.
- He just had to

05:00.801 --> 05:01.635
be on the team, didn't he?

05:01.669 --> 05:02.903
Foundation of the Earth
would crumble

05:02.936 --> 05:04.472
if he wasn't a Whitecap?
- I'm sorry,

05:04.505 --> 05:05.906
are you seriously gonna--
- Mr. and Mrs. Wilson,

05:05.939 --> 05:08.442
how about we step outside
for a moment, okay?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.847
Let's all just
settle down, here,

05:13.881 --> 05:15.949
'cause I'm sure we want
the same thing.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.918
- No, fundamentally,
we do not.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.554
I didn't want him to join
this team in the first place.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.755
- That's not fair.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.391
I played on the Whitecaps
when I was his age, and I-I--

05:23.424 --> 05:25.526
- I think arguing isn't
gonna help your son.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.461
- Neither are two police
officers hovering over him.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.397
- Mr. Wilson, your son's
injuries indicate

05:29.430 --> 05:31.532
he's a victim
of a sexual assault.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.934
- Sexual assault?

05:33.967 --> 05:38.539
I saw the doctor on the way in.
He said Jack will be fine.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.575
It was a prank
that went too far.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.144
- Mr. Wilson, that's--
that's not how we saw it.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.447
- Hey, Frank.
- Jim.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.915
- And there he is.
Hey, Kyle.

05:47.948 --> 05:51.051
- How's Jack? Is he okay?
What happened?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.953
- Well, he--

05:52.986 --> 05:56.424
- We think he's the victim
of a hazing incident.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.893
- Oh--I'm sorry, this is--
- I'm Lieutenant Benson.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.094
This is Detective Carisi.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.097
- Hazing? All we heard was
he collapsed in the parking lot.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.500
- So, uh, your name's Kyle?
You're on the Whitecaps, too?

06:06.534 --> 06:08.569
- He's the star.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.571
- Okay, so Kyle, did you
see anything unusual

06:10.604 --> 06:12.573
in the locker room
after the game?

06:12.606 --> 06:14.174
- No, it was quiet.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.176
Everyone just got dressed
and went home.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.045
- Did anybody
give Jack a hard time

06:18.078 --> 06:21.482
after missing that last shot?
- No, we're a team.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.551
Win or lose,
we stick together.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.518
- Well, we're gonna
speak with

06:24.552 --> 06:26.454
all the boys on the team,
but in the meantime,

06:26.487 --> 06:28.656
if you think of anything
or remember anything,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.123
please let us know.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.562
- Let's check and see
if Jack's ready for visitors.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.063
Seeing his best friend
ought to cheer him up.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.865
- Is it all right
if we go see our son?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.633
- Of course. Just--

06:39.667 --> 06:42.703
just let us know
if he remembers anything.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.206
All those players
in that locker room?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.075
Someone had to have
seen something.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.877
- Yeah. It's a team
full of young boys.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.178
Nobody wants to
get out in front of this.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.480
Even the victim won't talk.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.481
- Okay, so call Rollins,

06:53.514 --> 06:55.449
uh, have her head over
to the rink with Fin.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.150
Talk to refs, talk to coaches,

06:57.184 --> 06:58.986
and I want the name of every
single player

06:59.019 --> 07:00.554
on either team.
- Got it.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.623
And have CSU head over
to that locker room.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.894
- Poor kid.
I hope he's gonna be okay.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.462
- Well, he's recovering.
It's a serious injury.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.564
- What makes you think
it was one of my players?

07:10.598 --> 07:11.899
Could it have been someone
from the Squalls

07:11.932 --> 07:13.601
or a Whitecaps player
in a different division?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.702
- Division?
- Yeah, there are ten

07:14.735 --> 07:17.605
Whitecaps squads, separated by
age and skill level.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.640
Mites, squirts, peewees--
- Okay, but right now

07:19.673 --> 07:21.642
we need to focus
on your kids.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.043
- Sure, but I mean,
we compete

07:23.076 --> 07:25.646
for the New York State
Championship every year.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.481
- So?
- So none of my boys

07:27.515 --> 07:29.750
would jeopardize that
by doing something this stupid.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.085
- You got security cameras?
- Not in the locker rooms,

07:32.119 --> 07:33.587
but I'm sure there are
cameras around.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.589
Management can give you
whatever they have.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.257
- Any troublemakers
on your team?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.528
- [chuckles] Have you ever
traveled on a bus 4 1/2 hours

07:40.561 --> 07:42.530
full of 13-year-olds?
They're all troublemakers.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.664
- I mean repeat offenders.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.099
Kids that like to do
stupid things.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.068
- Um...
- Look, Coach,

07:48.101 --> 07:49.970
I know you don't wanna give up
any of your players,

07:50.003 --> 07:53.006
but, uh, you gotta cooperate.
- Come on.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.777
- [sighs] Fine.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.713
Timmy Brown and Will Harris.

07:59.747 --> 08:03.016
They're wild. The boys call them
the "Bash Brothers"

08:03.050 --> 08:04.785
'cause they tend to get
a little rough.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.520
But--but they've never
done anything

08:06.554 --> 08:08.055
like what happened to Jack.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.122
It--they wouldn't last
in this program.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.091
It's in violation of
their contract.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.126
- Their what?
- Their contract.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.763
It lays out our code of ethics.
Every player signs one.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.732
So it couldn't have been
a Whitecap.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.538
- Hey, where are we
with these Bang Brothers?

08:24.572 --> 08:27.207
- The Bash Brothers.
Like McGwire and Canseco.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.077
- No, like Reed and Portman.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.012
"Mighty Ducks 2"?

08:32.045 --> 08:33.246
Never mind.
Anyway, these guys

08:33.280 --> 08:34.582
have never been
in trouble with the law.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.749
They've got no juvenile records.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.051
- Okay, you checked,
their contracts?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.220
- All signed and notarized.
A lotta rules

08:40.253 --> 08:41.254
for an eighth grader.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.824
- I-I think I've got something.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.226
So I've been taking
a look at the security footage

08:46.259 --> 08:48.696
from the rink, look:

08:48.729 --> 08:50.731
Here are players leaving
the locker room, right?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.299
Most exit at the same time.

08:52.332 --> 08:57.337
But this is the last kid
before...look: these two.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.641
[tense music]

09:00.674 --> 09:04.612
*

09:04.645 --> 09:06.747
Numbers 26 and 9.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.215
And they're hauling ass, too.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.284
It's ten seconds before our
victim, Jack, comes out.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.121
- How can you tell that's him?
You can't make out his face.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.824
- Look, look there at the--
the sleeve.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.692
You see that? Number 14.
That's Jack's number.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.360
- Who are these two kids
that came out before him?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.731
- Number 9, William Harris.
Number 26, Timothy Brown.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.098
The Bash Brothers.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.133
- Okay. Bring them in.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.769
This wasn't a couple of kids
playing grab-ass.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.772
We need answers.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.708
- So you're telling us
you didn't see anything.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.244
- No. I was in my own world.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.246
We lost. I don't talk to
nobody when we lose.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.348
- He's not kidding.
Not even to me.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.250
- Any of your teammates
give Jack grief?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.417
- No.
- Okay, when you left

09:44.451 --> 09:47.254
the locker room, was it on
the early or the later side?

09:47.287 --> 09:50.858
- Early. I like to get out fast.
Especially when we lose.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.125
- Okay.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.595
How do you explain this?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.732
- Um, what are we watching?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.200
- That's your son
and his pal Timmy

10:00.233 --> 10:02.069
leaving the locker room
after the game.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.805
- They were the last ones
to leave before Jack.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.840
No one else was around.
- Wait, but that isn't me.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.041
- No? It's not you?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.277
You're wearing the exact same
jacket as you're wearing now.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.679
Same number.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.180
- So what happened, man?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.882
He caused you to lose the game,
so you decide

10:14.915 --> 10:16.750
to hang back
and teach him a lesson?

10:16.784 --> 10:18.351
- No, that's not true.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.420
We stayed to make sure
he was okay.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.554
- You didn't assault him?
If we get a warrant

10:21.588 --> 10:23.891
for your hockey sticks,
we're not gonna find Jack's DNA?

10:23.924 --> 10:26.193
- Okay, I don't know what
you're implying here.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.228
But my son--
- It wasn't our idea!

10:30.698 --> 10:31.865
We just held Jack down,

10:31.899 --> 10:34.134
but he made us do it.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.203
He went crazy, I've never seen
him like that before.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.272
- Timmy, slow down.
- You have to believe me.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.140
He's the one
who grabbed the stick.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.842
- No, Timothy--
- He was like an animal.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.411
- You keep saying "he."
Who is "he"?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.447
[dark music]

10:47.480 --> 10:49.817
*

10:49.850 --> 10:51.785
- Kyle Turner?
- Yeah.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.854
- Who are they?
- Adam, take Mark upstairs

10:53.887 --> 10:56.256
and call your father.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.391
What is this about?
- We need to talk to your son

10:58.425 --> 10:59.727
down at the precinct.
- And we're gonna

10:59.760 --> 11:00.894
need his hockey sticks.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.330
All of them.
- What? Why?

11:03.363 --> 11:04.732
- Because he's under
investigation

11:14.775 --> 11:14.908
.

11:14.942 --> 11:15.542
- Sexual assault?
My son?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.980
That's not--
that doesn't sound right.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.415
He'd never hurt Jack.
They're best friends.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.818
- Well, we have two eyewitnesses

11:24.852 --> 11:27.187
who say that they saw him do it.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.889
They claim that it was your idea

11:28.922 --> 11:31.158
and that you were
the main aggressor.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.761
- No. That isn't possible.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.063
And I don't want him answering
any more questions about this.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.733
Not until my husband gets here.
- That's fine, that's fine.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.969
We can wait, right?
- Sure.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.440
- Your number's 99?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.743
You gotta be
a big Gretzky fan, right?

11:49.777 --> 11:51.078
- He's the greatest
there ever was.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.079
- Yeah, he sure is.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.182
You miss 100% of the shots
you don't take, right?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.084
- Right?
- You really love hockey,

11:57.117 --> 12:00.053
don't you, Kyle?
- It's the best sport there is.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.189
- What if, um...

12:02.222 --> 12:05.225
what if it all went away?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.061
- What?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.163
- Well, we read
your player contract.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.532
The one that you signed.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.069
It explicitly forbids
violence against other players.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.873
- Which is exactly what
we're dealing with here.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.308
- No, that's not fair.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.777
- You can't kick him
off the Whitecaps.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.947
- You're right.
We could do a lot worse.

12:26.980 --> 12:30.884
Like...
like arrest him, for example.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.253
- Please, I-I don't know
who told you what,

12:33.286 --> 12:35.555
but--but it's not true.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.258
- Well, then tell us
what is true, Kyle.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.830
- Excuse me, I'm Jim Turner,
looking for my son Kyle Turner.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.131
He is in here somewhere.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.265
- Okay, one second, sir.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.500
Detective, Mr. Turner's
here to see you.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.969
- Yes, Mr. Turner.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.203
I'm Detective Rollins.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.571
- Where's Kyle?
- He's with your wife.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.973
They're in the middle
of an interview.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.975
- I don't think so.
I'm taking him home.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.211
- Well, we, uh,
we're allowed to question him

12:58.245 --> 13:00.513
with the consent of one parent,
which we have.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.250
- Look, I decide
what happens with my son--me.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.885
Now where is Kyle?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.988
- Mr. Turner? Can I help you?

13:08.021 --> 13:10.824
- I don't know what
my wife agreed to,

13:10.858 --> 13:13.160
but Kyle is done talking.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.995
I cannot risk him accidentally
saying something

13:15.028 --> 13:16.563
that's gonna ruin his career.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.597
He's got too much to lose.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.199
- Oh, I agree with you.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.169
But we have two witnesses
who say that they saw him

13:22.202 --> 13:24.071
assaulting Jack.
- I don't care

13:24.104 --> 13:25.105
if you have 200 witnesses.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.175
You have the wrong kid.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.877
I guess I need to
call a lawyer, don't I?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.211
Waste everybody's
time and money.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.880
Is this what
you're telling me?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.214
- That's not necessary.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.116
Uh, if you wait here,
I will let your wife

13:36.149 --> 13:38.051
and your son know
that they're free to go.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.891
- Wait, so we--we just--
we're turning this kid loose?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.860
- The lab ran the hockey sticks.
They're all clean.

13:46.894 --> 13:47.928
There's no blood,
there's no DNA.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.963
So Kyle must have
gotten rid of the one he used

13:49.997 --> 13:51.164
after he saw us
at the hospital.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.299
- So we don't have enough
to hold him.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.167
- No, but we have Jack.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.904
You and Fin, go to the hospital
first thing in the morning

13:56.937 --> 13:59.606
and get him to tell you
who attacked him.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.244
- So Jack,
we talked to Timmy and Will

14:04.277 --> 14:05.913
and they told us
what really happened.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.081
- We just need to
hear it from you.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.217
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.985
- Look man, I get it, okay?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.887
These are your teammates,
your friends,

14:13.921 --> 14:15.188
and you don't wanna
rat them out.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.323
- But that's not what
you're gonna be doing,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.225
because we already
know who did it.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.894
He was at the precinct
hours ago

14:20.928 --> 14:22.629
and he feels terrible
about what happened.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.598
- You talked to Kyle?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.067
- Kyle?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.236
Kyle Turner?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.906
You said you didn't see
who attacked you.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.241
Oh, it can't be.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.044
Timmy and Will, sure,
they're idiots.

14:37.077 --> 14:41.048
But Jack and Kyle have known
each other since kindergarten.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.215
They're inseparable.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.650
- You guys are sure
it was him?

14:43.683 --> 14:44.952
- Yeah, we're sure.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.321
- But we do need
your son to confirm it.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.361
- Forget about
the team, Jack, just...

14:54.394 --> 14:57.197
go ahead and tell them.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.172
- I've never seen him
like that before.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.673
- Who?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.641
- Kyle, okay?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.978
Kyle.

15:11.011 --> 15:15.382
It was like he was this
whole other person.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
Timmy and Will grabbed me.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.219
I couldn't move.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.188
Couldn't fight back.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.124
Suddenly, Kyle had the stick.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.995
And he looked at me
all crazy and he--

15:28.028 --> 15:30.497
And I just--

15:30.530 --> 15:33.300
I don't know.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.036
And then it was over.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.673
- I-I don't understand.

15:40.707 --> 15:44.344
He came to see you here
at the hospital, I--

15:44.377 --> 15:46.479
- If you don't mind,
we need some time.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.249
Alone.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.450
- Sure.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.286
- What's going to happen
to Kyle?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.023
- We're gonna arrest him.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.025
- Tell him that...

15:58.058 --> 16:00.093
that I know he didn't mean it.

16:00.127 --> 16:03.163
[somber music]

16:03.196 --> 16:05.732
*

16:05.765 --> 16:07.100
[knocking]

16:07.134 --> 16:09.436
- NYPD.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.240
- Yeah?

16:13.273 --> 16:16.243
- Adam, right?
We're looking for your parents.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.744
- Yeah, they're not here.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.546
It's, uh, it's just me and Mark.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.415
- So Kyle's not here?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.552
- My, uh, my dad called.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.788
Kyle hurt his arm
during practice.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.358
They're at the hospital.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.095
- Okay, thank you.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.103
- What is this?
What are you doing here?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.571
- We have a warrant
for your son's arrest.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.573
- You're joking, right?
- Jim, what's going on?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.808
- I got this, Helen.
Kyle's still with the doctor.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.410
I know it doesn't
matter to you,

16:50.443 --> 16:52.145
but he might have
broken his wrist.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.446
- How did that happen?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.583
- Hockey practice.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.351
You know, we got enough
going on right now

16:58.385 --> 17:00.287
without you harassing us,
okay?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.355
- You don't wanna talk to us,
that's your prerogative,

17:02.389 --> 17:05.058
but we are gonna wait here
until your son is released.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.360
And then we're going
to arrest him.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.167
Excuse me, Doctor,

17:14.201 --> 17:15.768
I'm Lieutenant Benson.
This is Detective Carisi.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.138
We saw you in there
with Kyle Turner.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.472
How is he?
- Spiral fracture.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.541
He'll be okay.
Uh, was he assaulted?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.243
- Uh, actually,
he's a person of interest

17:23.276 --> 17:25.112
in a case
that we're investigating.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.480
- I-I see.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.183
- And you asked
if he was assaulted, why?

17:30.217 --> 17:34.587
- His injury suggests someone
twisted his wrist, violently.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.556
- Which is hard to do
playing hockey.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.590
- Hard, not impossible.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.392
- Can we take a look
at the kid's medical records?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.794
- Not without a subpoena.
There are laws--

17:41.828 --> 17:43.796
- We're SVU,
we know the laws.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.632
- We also know that
as a mandatory reporter,

17:45.665 --> 17:50.270
you're required to call us
if you have any suspicions, so--

17:52.205 --> 17:55.642
Do you?

17:55.675 --> 17:59.246
- I found a few other
spiral fractures on his x-ray.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.281
It appears as if
they went untreated.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.649
- So you're saying
that it is possible

18:02.682 --> 18:04.817
that Kyle has been
physically abused.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.854
[tense music]

18:14.827 --> 18:14.961
.

18:14.994 --> 18:15.562
- Hey, Kyle.
How you doing?

18:16.563 --> 18:19.632
- Your wrist must still
be hurting, but Kyle,

18:19.666 --> 18:22.369
we need to take you down
to the police station.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.337
- Because of
what happened to Jack?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.239
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.507
- Do we have to go now?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.576
Where's my dad?
I need to talk to him.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.711
- Don't worry,
he's gonna come with us too.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.880
Okay?
So how'd that happen?

18:33.913 --> 18:36.649
- I got tripped up
at practice.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.419
Landed on my wrist sorta funny.
- At practice?

18:39.452 --> 18:42.622
Okay, so somebody else
can verify that?

18:42.655 --> 18:45.358
- Well, it was only
me and my dad.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.728
He--he didn't see it, though,
w-when I fell.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.397
- Okay, well here's
the thing, Kyle:

18:50.430 --> 18:52.299
we don't think
you're telling us the truth.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.834
And the doctor's pretty sure
that's not the way it happened.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.270
- And your medical records
show that...

18:57.304 --> 18:59.339
that this isn't the first time

18:59.372 --> 19:02.309
that you've been
injured this way.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.711
- I-I don't know
what you mean.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.713
- Kyle, has anybody
been getting physical with you?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.681
At home? Grabbing at you?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.450
- N-no!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.852
I-I fell.
- Kyle, listen to me.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.322
We wanna help you.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.724
And there's a real chance
that you could go to prison

19:17.757 --> 19:21.428
for what you did to Jack.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.297
- But I thought only adults
could go to prison.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.500
- Nope.
Sometimes kids go, too.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.669
So you need to talk to us
and tell us

19:29.702 --> 19:31.838
if somebody put you up to this

19:31.871 --> 19:33.573
or if somebody threatened you.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.743
You need to tell us that, okay?
- What the hell are you--

19:36.776 --> 19:38.711
How many times
do I have to tell you

19:38.745 --> 19:39.846
you do not have my permission--
- Hold on.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.448
Look, we have more questions.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.450
- Not without our consent.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.653
- Actually, we don't need your
consent in this situation.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.821
- What are you
talking about?

19:48.855 --> 19:52.859
- We have evidence that
that your son has been abused.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.863
Physically.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.865
- [laughs] Abused?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.633
That's ridiculous.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.536
- I-I already told them
that I fell.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.872
- So we have two choices.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.774
I can arrest Kyle right here,
right now.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.776
Or we can all go down
to the precinct

20:09.809 --> 20:11.444
and talk this through.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.646
- Your other sons, too.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.652
- Fine.
Let's talk it through.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.421
Get to the bottom of this.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.690
'Cause we got nothing to hide.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.928
- So, uh, why am I here?

20:28.961 --> 20:32.399
- We just wanna know a little
bit more about your family.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.966
- Yeah, like what?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.002
- Let's start with Kyle.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.770
You two tight?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.506
- Yeah, sure.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.674
You know, he gets on my nerves
sometimes, but you know,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.543
he's my little brother.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.711
That's his job.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.446
- Would you ever
do anything to hurt him?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.715
Beat him up?
Something like that?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
- You serious?

20:50.617 --> 20:52.819
No, no. We're best friends.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.455
We look out for each other.
Always have.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.723
Always will.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.658
- Okay. How about Kyle
and your dad?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.427
How do they get along?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.695
- Kyle and Jim have
a great relationship.

21:02.729 --> 21:06.633
He wants what's best
for Kyle.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.036
- Does, uh, does he ever
get rough with Kyle?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.103
- No.

21:11.137 --> 21:15.675
That is not something
that goes on in our house.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.445
- 'Cause, uh,
your son's medical records

21:18.478 --> 21:20.613
tell a different story.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.820
Mrs. Turner, I don't--

21:27.854 --> 21:30.690
I-I don't think you understand.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.992
Kyle has committed
a serious crime.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.027
It's aggravated sexual assault.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.697
He can be charged as an adult.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.600
And if he's convicted,
he's gonna go away.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.568
- But he's only a boy.

21:41.601 --> 21:44.904
- Which is why we want to
give the prosecutor

21:44.937 --> 21:47.907
some reason to help your son.

21:47.940 --> 21:52.812
But you're gonna have to
help us out to do that.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.013
- How?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.815
- You gotta tell us
what's going on

21:55.848 --> 21:58.685
between Kyle and his dad.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.892
At least do it for Kyle's
little brother Mark.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.899
- Listen...

22:12.932 --> 22:14.967
What you did to Jack,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.604
they're gonna lock you up
for that.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.872
But if you can tell me
who really hurt your wrist--

22:19.906 --> 22:21.107
- I can't!

22:23.843 --> 22:25.945
- Listen, if you're afraid
of your dad,

22:25.978 --> 22:27.814
we can keep you safe.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.081
We can get you away from him.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.818
- I love my dad.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.885
He's just...

22:32.919 --> 22:35.622
helping me
become a better player.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.825
- Yeah, well...

22:38.858 --> 22:40.927
It's not gonna matter
when you're in prison.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.998
You understand?

22:49.168 --> 22:51.904
- This is
just a misunderstanding.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.573
That's all.

22:53.606 --> 22:54.574
How do we make it go away?

22:54.607 --> 22:58.110
- We don't. We can't.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.712
But we might be able
to find a way

22:59.746 --> 23:02.081
to make his punishment
less severe.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.784
- How?

23:04.817 --> 23:10.122
- You admit to abusing Kyle.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.592
- Excuse me?

23:14.026 --> 23:16.095
[scoffs]

23:18.030 --> 23:20.533
Look, my parenting style
might be old-school,

23:20.567 --> 23:22.068
but I'm never physical.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.071
Kyle wants to be
a great player.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.073
I know how to get him there.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.841
Came close to
playing pro myself.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.910
- How do you explain
the spiral fractures,

23:30.943 --> 23:32.912
all those untreated injuries?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.081
- He's a hockey player.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.083
Sometimes he gets hurt.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.652
But he plays through
the pain.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.955
He doesn't complain
like most of his pansy friends.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.592
That's just who he is.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.962
- Well, we tried. I mean,

23:49.996 --> 23:52.665
clearly, this family
is not gonna budge.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.802
- So what do you wanna do?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.604
- Kyle Turner,
you're under arrest

23:57.637 --> 24:00.039
for aggravated sexual assault.
You have the right

24:00.072 --> 24:01.774
to remain silent...
- Kyle, don't say anything.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.142
I'll take care of this.
- Where are you taking him?

24:03.175 --> 24:04.143
- To be processed.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.613
- You people are unbelievable
with this PC crap.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.815
They're kids.
They were just screwing around.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.116
- Kyle will be arraigned
in family court

24:10.149 --> 24:12.885
later this afternoon.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.922
[somber music]

24:15.955 --> 24:18.991
*

24:19.025 --> 24:21.027
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd arraignment go?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.995
- Released
into his parents' custody.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.797
I spoke to a lawyer
at Corporation Counsel.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.933
She said she's getting
a lot of pressure from upstairs

24:26.966 --> 24:29.101
to try Kyle as an adult.
- I thought we were

24:29.135 --> 24:31.237
just using that as a ploy.
He's just a kid.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.172
- There's been a lot more
hazing incidents lately,

24:33.205 --> 24:34.841
and they wanna make
an example.

24:34.874 --> 24:38.177
- I know he's our perp,
but...the kid's a victim too.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.246
There's no doubt that father's
doing a number on him,

24:40.279 --> 24:42.749
and the mother too.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.083
- The mother?
- Yeah.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.085
She just sits there,
watches it all happen,

24:46.118 --> 24:48.154
stands by silently?
That's abuse.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.090
- I get what you're saying,
but it's not that simple.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.959
- Yeah, it is.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.894
Somebody lays a hand
on Jesse,

24:54.927 --> 24:57.063
I'm gonna have something
to say about it, I guarantee it.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.665
- Hold on,
so this woman Helen,

24:58.698 --> 25:00.032
you don't think
that she's a victim too?

25:00.066 --> 25:01.901
You think her husband's
sending her roses every day?

25:01.934 --> 25:03.670
- Oh, come on.
- Well, it's not just about

25:03.703 --> 25:05.171
the physical abuse--
it's the shame of it.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.940
- I know that!
And that's why bullies

25:07.974 --> 25:09.842
keep getting away with
being bullies.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.678
[phone vibrating]
- You're missing my point.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.780
- I'm not.
I'm hearing what you're--

25:15.715 --> 25:17.784
- Hey, Lieutenant.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.186
All right,
I'll meet you down there.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.922
I gotta go meet Liv
at the hospital,

25:22.955 --> 25:24.957
talk to Jack
and his parents again.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.930
All I'm saying
is that sometimes

25:30.963 --> 25:34.233
it's not as easy as you think
to be a hero.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.209
- Excuse me.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.212
Hi, can you tell us where
Jack Wilson's been moved to?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.180
He's not in his same room.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.118
- Are you with
the Special Victims Unit?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.020
- Yes.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.789
- Didn't someone call you?

25:56.823 --> 25:58.725
- Call us about what?

26:09.235 --> 26:09.368
.

26:09.401 --> 26:09.802
- He had a fever.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.205
Um, they said
all he needed was fluids,

26:13.239 --> 26:14.674
some antibiotics.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.376
We didn't think anything of it.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.112
- Then his blood pressure
started dropping.

26:20.146 --> 26:23.249
They rushed him
to intensive care, but...

26:23.282 --> 26:25.718
They said it was an infection.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.689
- We are so sorry for your loss.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.725
- Someone needs to
pay for this.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.227
- We'll be charging Kyle Turner
with manslaughter.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.263
- Go ahead, charge Kyle.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.198
But it's his sick
son of a bitch father

26:39.231 --> 26:42.068
you should really be after.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.803
- How do you mean?

26:43.836 --> 26:46.138
- Jim got into Kyle's head,
turned him into a bully.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.107
I've seen what he did
to the older one, too.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.142
Who knows how long Mark has
before that lunatic

26:50.176 --> 26:51.377
starts in on him?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.814
- You've witnessed abuse?

26:54.847 --> 26:58.685
- He's always berating,
pushing, grabbing.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.352
- Have you ever seen him
hit Kyle?

27:00.386 --> 27:03.255
- I didn't have to. With guys
like him, you can tell.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.857
I didn't think it was
my business,

27:04.891 --> 27:07.727
but all that pressure
and rage--

27:07.760 --> 27:09.829
it was only a matter of time.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.399
If you ask me, his father is
just as responsible as Kyle is

27:13.432 --> 27:16.903
for my son's death.
[both sobbing]

27:23.342 --> 27:24.677
- Jack's parents
were right.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.544
Jim Turner
looks good for this.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.346
- What do you mean?
You found something?

27:27.379 --> 27:28.580
- Maybe. We canvassed
the other parents on the team.

27:28.614 --> 27:31.250
We found this cell phone video
taken right after the game.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.386
- It looks like Kyle's father
is giving him an order--

27:34.420 --> 27:36.222
give Jack a beatdown or else.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.357
- Where did this come from?
- The goalie's mom.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.259
She was waiting for
her older son's game to begin.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.393
She caught this
accidentally.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.395
Kyle comes out of
the locker room.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.897
He's in his street clothes.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.266
He talks to his dad,
gets an earful.

27:47.299 --> 27:50.870
[muffled audio]

27:52.772 --> 27:54.373
- We've got TARU,
our tech experts,

27:54.406 --> 27:56.175
retrieving the audio
from this video.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.376
Pretty soon, we're gonna
know exactly

27:57.409 --> 27:58.878
what your dad said to you.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.881
- If he told you to hurt Jack--
- He didn't.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.482
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.785
- Listen, Kyle,
Jack is dead.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.820
And somebody's gotta be held
responsible for that.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.421
- He answered the question,
Detective.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.858
- Just tell them the truth,
for God's sake!

28:11.891 --> 28:12.892
- Adam, stop!

28:12.925 --> 28:14.894
- Mom!
[stammers] I mean--

28:14.927 --> 28:18.464
- Kyle will be fine.
Everything is going to be okay.

28:18.497 --> 28:23.302
- Mrs. Turner, everything
will not be okay.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.939
That ship sailed once
Jack stopped breathing.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.310
If you wanna help your son,

28:31.343 --> 28:34.513
have him tell the truth.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.283
- And blame my husband?

28:37.316 --> 28:38.785
His father?

28:38.818 --> 28:41.921
Do you know what
you're asking him to do?

28:41.954 --> 28:44.957
- Dad.
- What is this?

28:44.991 --> 28:46.358
What now?

28:48.060 --> 28:51.397
- He--he didn't tell me
to do anything.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.332
- [quietly]
Okay.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.734
If you say so.

28:58.437 --> 29:01.808
The prosecutor will
be charging Kyle

29:01.841 --> 29:04.977
with sexual assault
and manslaughter.

29:05.011 --> 29:07.513
As an adult.

[somber music]

29:10.516 --> 29:17.523

29:17.556 --> 29:19.058
- On the additional charge
of manslaughter

29:19.091 --> 29:21.460
in the first degree,
how does the defendant plead?

29:21.493 --> 29:23.229
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.964
- People on remand?
- We see no reason why

29:24.997 --> 29:26.398
the defendant
shouldn't be released

29:26.432 --> 29:28.835
back into his parents' custody,
pending trial.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.803
- Are the defendant's parents
present?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.371
- We are.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.406
- You are willing to take
custody of your son,

29:34.440 --> 29:36.342
to see that he follows a curfew,

29:36.375 --> 29:37.844
ensure that he shows up
for trial?

29:37.877 --> 29:39.478
- Absolutely, Your Honor.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.980
- If that's the case,

29:41.013 --> 29:42.815
then I will release him
into your custody.

29:42.849 --> 29:45.918
But any infractions,
and he will be remanded.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.920
Next case.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.093
- Adam!
- This is crap.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.863
My brother's going to jail.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.298
Right?
Look, why aren't you guys

29:59.331 --> 30:01.000
trying to help him?

30:01.033 --> 30:02.534
- With Jack dead,

30:02.568 --> 30:05.104
the only thing that's gonna
move the needle on this

30:05.137 --> 30:10.009
is Kyle testifying that your
father told him to assault Jack.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.979
- Listen, he won't do it.

30:13.012 --> 30:17.049
Okay? My--my dad has just
got him all twisted up.

30:17.083 --> 30:20.586
- Then help us.
Help us change his mind.

[phone rings]

30:30.162 --> 30:32.899
- Carisi, SVU.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.935
All right, Mrs. Turner,
just calm down.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.569
All right,
we'll be right over.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.438
Rollins, we gotta go.
- What's going on?

30:39.471 --> 30:42.408
- Jim Turner just beat
the hell out of Adam.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.543
- I'll call
the local precinct.

30:44.576 --> 30:47.479
[police radio chatter]

30:49.181 --> 30:51.617
- [pained groaning]
- Adam.

30:53.419 --> 30:56.588
Adam, we're getting you
some help, okay?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.891
- What happened?
- Adam just kept

30:58.925 --> 30:59.858
pushing Jim's buttons.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.061
I couldn't stop it.
- Where's your husband

31:02.094 --> 31:03.930
right now?
- He ran out of here.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.464
I don't know.
- Where's Mark?

31:05.497 --> 31:07.934
- He's not here.
I sent him to my mom's.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.601
- Listen--no, no, no,
listen, Adam,

31:09.635 --> 31:10.970
don't move, we're getting you
an ambulance.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.972
All right, baby?
Stay right there.

31:14.106 --> 31:17.343
- You needed a way
to get Kyle to talk.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.445
This is it.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.647
I got it on video.

[dark music]

31:24.716 --> 31:32.424

31:34.460 --> 31:39.098
Don't protect him anymore.

31:51.677 --> 31:51.810
.

31:51.843 --> 31:52.911
- You're letting Kyle
go to jail for this!

31:53.612 --> 31:56.215
And you told him to do it.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.250
Didn't you?
- Kyle will be fine.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.986
- Oh, no--
How is he going to be fine?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.321
- Just stay the hell
out of it!

32:02.354 --> 32:03.722
[overlapping shouting]
Stay out of it!

32:03.755 --> 32:04.923
- You know what
the worst part is?

32:04.957 --> 32:07.226
He believes that your BS
is actually helping him.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.096
And now what, you're just
gonna let him go down for it?

32:10.129 --> 32:12.631
- Keep talking--
- No, I'm not afraid of you!

32:12.664 --> 32:14.967
You're a loser!
- [muttering]

32:15.001 --> 32:16.268
- And a coward!

32:16.302 --> 32:19.338
- What did you call me?

32:19.371 --> 32:21.107
[grunting, thudding]

32:21.140 --> 32:22.708
Yeah? Who's a coward now?

32:22.741 --> 32:25.211
- [screaming]
Stop it!

32:25.244 --> 32:26.278
Stop i--
[click]

32:26.312 --> 32:29.081
- Well, this should
make Kyle flip.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.387
- Kyle's confused.
Jim has this...

32:35.421 --> 32:36.688
hold over him.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.190
- Well, Helen,
for God's sakes,

32:38.224 --> 32:39.458
don't you get it?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.493
Your son
is gonna go away.

32:41.527 --> 32:45.297
- If I tell Kyle to testify,
Jim goes to jail.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.766
- But he is abusing your sons.
He broke Kyle's wrist.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.335
He beat the hell
out of Adam.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.238
- He didn't mean to.
He loves them...

32:52.271 --> 32:54.273
and they love him.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.142
He's a good man.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.309
He just--
- He just what,

32:57.343 --> 32:58.744
has a bad temper,
he gets impatient?

32:58.777 --> 33:00.479
That's a cop-out, Helen.

33:05.051 --> 33:08.087
- Every day,
for the past five years,

33:08.120 --> 33:10.122
I wake up and say,

33:10.156 --> 33:14.026
"I'm going to take the boys
and leave."

33:14.060 --> 33:16.428
But then he...

33:16.462 --> 33:19.298
he does something that makes me
see the other side.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.433
He mows my mother's lawn

33:21.467 --> 33:24.736
or pays for her arthritis
medication.

33:24.770 --> 33:29.175
Or tells me that he...

33:29.208 --> 33:31.143
he loves me.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.045
And I say to myself,

33:33.079 --> 33:36.282
"This is a good man."

33:36.315 --> 33:39.185
But then...
- He changes.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.353
He gets abusive.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.456
Because that's part of
who he is too.

33:44.490 --> 33:50.296
- You're right.
It is.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.198
It's just so hard
to accept the fact

33:52.231 --> 33:55.234
that you...

33:55.267 --> 33:59.738
that this is the man you picked
to spend your life with.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.741
To have children with.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.510
So you keep trying
to fix things.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.545
- Even though
it's not fixable.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.381
Listen...

34:09.415 --> 34:12.351
Kyle's a boy.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.186
You can fix him.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.788
Okay? But first of all,
you've gotta convince him

34:16.822 --> 34:19.258
to testify, to go on record
and say that his dad

34:19.291 --> 34:22.561
forced him to assault Jack
with that hockey stick.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.273
- Adam was right.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.175
My dad...

34:36.208 --> 34:37.809
he told me to do it.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.412
- He told you
to assault Jack.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.582
- Yeah.

34:43.615 --> 34:46.418
He wanted Jack to know that
he couldn't screw up anymore.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.255
- Your dad told you
to use the hockey stick?

34:49.288 --> 34:52.324
- He says that's the way
you're supposed to do it.

34:52.358 --> 34:56.862
I don't even remember
what happened.

34:56.895 --> 35:00.299
I-I really didn't
want to hurt Jack.

35:00.332 --> 35:03.269
He was--he was my friend.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.337
- Okay.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.340
So you're ready to say
in court

35:08.374 --> 35:10.876
that your dad told you to
assault Jack.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.878
- He's still my dad.

35:12.911 --> 35:15.614
I-I don't want him
to get in trouble.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.185
- You know something, Kyle?
When I first saw Jack

35:19.218 --> 35:21.220
laid up in that hospital,

35:21.253 --> 35:23.889
I was pretty upset.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.292
I was angry at who did it.

35:26.325 --> 35:31.630
Because right away,
Jack reminded me of...

35:31.663 --> 35:33.565
of me.

35:36.202 --> 35:40.172
You see, I was the scrawny kid,
way back when.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.407
Guys in the neighborhood,

35:41.440 --> 35:42.874
they used to
pick on me every day.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.611
The worst was this--
[sighs]

35:45.644 --> 35:48.547
this kid, Bobby Bianchi.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.415
One day when we were at school,

35:49.448 --> 35:52.384
he grabbed me
by the hair and he...

35:52.418 --> 35:56.355
he shoved my face through
a plate glass window.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.689
- Must have hurt.

35:57.723 --> 36:01.627
- I was bleeding,
I was all cut up.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.529
The principal asked
what happened.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.531
Now I could have put
an end to it.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.967
Right there, all I had to do
was say Bobby's name.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.869
But I didn't.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.540
Because I didn't want Bobby
to get into trouble.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.443
- He got away with it?
- That's right.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.946
Nobody ever knew what
happened.

36:20.979 --> 36:24.283
You know where Bobby
is now?

36:24.316 --> 36:26.252
He's in Sing Sing

36:26.285 --> 36:28.620
for stabbing
some poor sap to death

36:28.654 --> 36:30.356
during a bar fight.

36:30.389 --> 36:34.526
And I always think, what if
I would have said something?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.229
What if I just would have
said something?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.231
Maybe...

36:39.265 --> 36:42.301
that guy would still be
alive.

36:49.475 --> 36:53.412
I missed my shot, Kyle.

36:53.445 --> 36:57.416
Not a day goes by
that I don't regret it.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.418
But this is your shot.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.253
Right now.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.426
- And if not for you, Kyle,

37:07.459 --> 37:10.496
do it for your little brother.

37:10.529 --> 37:13.432
Because what happens
when he gets older,

37:13.465 --> 37:15.967
and you're not around
to look after him?

37:16.001 --> 37:17.703
Hmm?

37:17.736 --> 37:20.772
You ever think about that?

37:20.806 --> 37:24.576
Look, if you're willing
to talk to the judge,

37:24.610 --> 37:27.479
we can get this case
sent back to Family Court,

37:27.513 --> 37:30.549
and you will get
a reduced charge.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.784
Which means do less time.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.968
- Okay.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.338
I'll do it.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.476
- Okay, good.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.614
And Kyle, we'll also need
your help finding your father.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.629

38:17.663 --> 38:19.498
Didn't know you're so quick
on your feet.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.032
- You gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.668
- That's right.
- You didn't make that up,

38:22.701 --> 38:25.070
though, did you?

38:25.103 --> 38:27.406
That really happened to you,
didn't it?

38:42.721 --> 38:46.658
- So?

38:46.692 --> 38:48.427
What's got you so worried
that I needed

38:48.460 --> 38:50.796
to come all the way out here?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.598
- Everything's screwed up.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.367
You told me
to do that to Jack.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.403
You said it was gonna help him.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.671
Help the team.
- Yeah, I know I said that.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.641
And guess what? Not everything
always goes according to plan.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.477
Do you think I wanted
any of this?

39:05.511 --> 39:08.113
We just gotta roll with it,
that's all.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.482
- They're gonna send me away.
- Hey, cut it out now.

39:10.516 --> 39:13.585
Don't talk like that, all right?
Listen, you're gonna be fine.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.488
Stud athletes like you
don't go to jail.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.524
- The police said--
- Never mind them.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.492
All right?
You keep your head up,

39:20.526 --> 39:21.727
you keep your mouth shut

39:21.760 --> 39:24.630
and you let the lawyer
do the rest.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.131
Now you gotta stay focused,
all right?

39:26.164 --> 39:28.133
You gotta think about
all the good things to come.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.101
Everything
that's coming your way.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.904

Then what?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.606
College puck.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.709
And then you're gonna go pro.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.578
And then, hey, when Mark
gets a little bit older,

39:39.611 --> 39:40.712
can you imagine?

39:40.746 --> 39:42.814
We teach him.
You and me.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.551
We toughen him up, we train him,
we whip him into shape.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.587
Then the Turner boys
are the face of the league.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.723
We can have our own dynasty!
- That's not gonna happen.

- Mr. Turner.
- We've been looking

Are you wearing a wire?

- Hey! You're under arrest.
- Everything I did,

40:07.606 --> 40:09.541
I did it for you.
You know that, right?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.777
Listen to me, listen to me.
Look at what you have.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.844
- Hey, come on.
- Look at what

40:12.878 --> 40:14.145
you've accomplished!

Who taught you how

40:17.883 --> 40:21.119

40:21.152 --> 40:23.489
- I'm sorry, Dad.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.537

father out of the house.

40:42.874 --> 40:46.444
- 13 years too late.
