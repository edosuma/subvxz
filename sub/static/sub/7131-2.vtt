ANDREW LESLEY.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.458
- ANDREW LESLEY'S HERE?

00:17.458 --> 00:20.333
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TELL YOU I LOVED YOUR SCRIPT.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.709
- YOU DID NOT.

00:21.709 --> 00:23.583
- WHAT AN ASSHOLE.
- WHICH ONE?

00:23.583 --> 00:25.041
- TAKE YOUR PICK.

00:25.041 --> 00:28.166
- THIS NETWORK HAS NEVER HAD
A WOMAN IN THAT JOB.

00:28.166 --> 00:31.792
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD--
- WHAT ABOUT HELEN BASCH?

00:31.792 --> 00:33.083
- UH, WOW.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.375
SHE ACTS LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED,
BUT COME ON.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.000
I BROKE UP HER MARRIAGE.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.166
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA WANT ME
AS HER NUMBER TWO?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.375
- CALL YOUR AGENT.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.542
SELL YOUR SHOW.
MAKE THE MONEY.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.417
- I'M SORRY.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.625
- THE FBI'S BEEN INVESTIGATING
HIM FOR STEALING MONEY

00:49.625 --> 00:51.875
FROM HIS CLIENTS.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.875

- HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE WITH HIM?

00:53.875 --> 00:56.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW MUCH?
ALL OF IT.

00:56.333 --> 00:59.458
- OH, SHIT.
- MOTHERFUCKING SON OF A BITCH.

00:59.458 --> 01:03.083

I'VE BEEN GETTING TONS OF CALLS
FOR A COMMENT.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.625
- ABOUT WHAT?

02:23.625 --> 02:24.834
- THE MONEY THING.

02:24.834 --> 02:25.875
- THE WHAT?

02:25.875 --> 02:27.083
- THE MONEY THING.

LARRY PENZEL?
STEALING YOUR MONEY?

YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

WAS MY BUSINESS MANAGER

02:50.333 --> 02:52.000

IN HELL.

VICTIMS OF HIS FRAUD

02:56.834 --> 02:58.375

03:07.917 --> 03:10.333
- BULLSHIT.
- ANY OTHER THOUGHTS?

03:10.333 --> 03:16.041
- I HOPE HE COMES BACK TO LIFE,
GETS ASS CANCER, AND DIES AGAIN.

03:16.041 --> 03:19.041

ARE YOU TWO TOGETHER?

03:44.834 --> 03:47.375
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.208
- SO, LOTS TO REPORT.

03:49.208 --> 03:52.166
I SET UP ALL OUR NETWORK
MEETINGS FOR FRIDAY.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.375
I FIGURE WE'LL DO THEM IN A ROW,
BANG, BANG, BANG,

03:54.375 --> 03:56.875
AND THEN GO FOR LUNCH
AND SEE WHERE WE ARE.

03:56.875 --> 03:57.875
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.083
- OKAY, SEE YOU FRIDAY!

04:00.083 --> 04:04.542
EVERYBODY WANTS YOU.
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN!

04:04.542 --> 04:06.542
- BYE.
- THANK YOU.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.917
WHAT?

04:07.917 --> 04:10.750
- YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.458
- FINANCIALLY I THINK
WE'D BE FOOLISH NOT TO.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.041
IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.542
- DARLING, WHY ON EARTH
WOULD IT BE DIFFERENT?

04:19.542 --> 04:21.083
- LET'S AT LEAST HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.709
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY.

04:22.709 --> 04:24.333
THEY'LL SAY WHATEVER
WE WANT TO HEAR.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.834
- LOOK, THEY CAN'T ALL BE
DEVIOUS FUCKWITS.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.458
- YES, THEY CAN!

04:28.458 --> 04:31.709
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?
WE TAKE THE MEETINGS.

04:31.709 --> 04:32.959
- AND SHOVE THEM?

04:32.959 --> 04:34.583
- IF WE CAN FIND ONE
THAT WE BOTH AGREE

04:34.583 --> 04:36.625
WON'T CRUSH OUR SOULS,

04:36.625 --> 04:38.250
THEN WE'LL CONSIDER
DOING THE SHOW.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.375
OTHERWISE,
BACK IN THE DRAWER IT GOES.

04:40.375 --> 04:44.166
- I'LL TAKE THOSE ODDS.
- THANK YOU.

04:44.166 --> 04:47.417
I LIKED THE OTHER SHIRT BETTER.
- I KNOW.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.625
YOU'RE WEARING IT.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.333
- HOW BAD IS IT?

04:54.333 --> 04:57.917
- WELL, ON ONE HAND,
EVEN WITH THE EMBEZZLEMENT,

04:57.917 --> 04:59.208
YOU'RE STILL A WEALTHY MAN.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.834
- AND THE OTHER HAND?
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.291
IF YOU MAINTAIN
YOUR CURRENT RATE OF SPENDING,

05:04.291 --> 05:07.625
YOU'LL RUN OUT OF MONEY
BY THE TIME YOU GET HERE.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.417
- 2019?

05:10.417 --> 05:11.834
FUCKING OTHER HAND.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.875
- THE PROBLEM IS
YOU HAVE VIRTUALLY NO CASH.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.542
EVERYTHING'S TIED UP
IN NON-LIQUID ASSETS:

05:17.542 --> 05:21.417

A DINOSAUR EGG?

05:21.417 --> 05:23.000

05:23.000 --> 05:24.959
IT'S, LIKE, THIS BIG
WITH SPOTS ON IT AND--

05:24.959 --> 05:26.542
- WHAT WE NEED TO DO

05:26.542 --> 05:30.458
IS CONVERT SOME OF THAT
TO INCOME-GENERATING CAPITAL.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.834
- MEANING WHAT, SELL SHIT?

05:31.834 --> 05:32.959
- RIGHT.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.625
WHAT WE ALSO NEED TO DO

05:34.625 --> 05:37.625
IS LOOK AT REDUCING
YOUR EXPENSES.

05:37.625 --> 05:41.041
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE FIXED COSTS
THAT ARE UNAVOIDABLE.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.291
- INSURANCE, MEDICAL,

05:43.291 --> 05:45.583
THE MORTGAGE
ON YOUR FATHER'S CONDO.

05:45.583 --> 05:49.000
- UM, THAT ONE'S NOT IN STONE.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.166
- YOU'RE PREPARED TO EVICT
YOUR FATHER?

05:51.166 --> 05:55.333
- I'M JUST SAYING LET'S KEEP IT
IN OUR BACK POCKET.

05:55.333 --> 05:59.583
- ALL RIGHT.
UH, CHILD SUPPORT, ALIMONY--

05:59.583 --> 06:00.959
- ACTUALLY,
THAT ONE'S GOING AWAY.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.709
MY EX-WIFE'S GETTING REMARRIED.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.875
- WELL,
THAT'S A SIZABLE SAVINGS.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.542
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.000
- DO WE KNOW
WHEN THAT'S HAPPENING?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.750
- NO, BUT I CAN FIND OUT.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.250
- TAKING THAT OFF THE BOOKS
WILL BE A BIG HELP, BIG.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.709
- SEE?
IT'S NOT ALL THE OTHER HAND.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.667
- IT'S A START.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.083
WE ALSO NEED TO TALK
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR MORE, UH,

06:21.083 --> 06:23.959
DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.917
WHO IS JOSE PADILLA?

06:26.917 --> 06:29.542
- HE'S THE GUY
WHO SWEEPS MY BEACH.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.667
- AND IF HE DIDN'T?

06:31.667 --> 06:33.542
- WHO'S GONNA DO IT?

06:33.542 --> 06:37.959
- SEE, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
WE MAY NEED TO ELIMINATE.

06:37.959 --> 06:40.208
- WOW, THAT SEEMS
PRETTY DRASTIC.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.375
- WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT IT.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.333
ALL RIGHT, UM,
THERE'S THE VINEYARD.

06:46.333 --> 06:49.250
- NO, NO.
NO, THAT'S INCOME-PRODUCING.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.792
I MAKE MONEY ON THE WINE.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.667
- ACTUALLY,
AARON RAN THE NUMBERS.

06:53.667 --> 06:56.041
- FOR WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING
TO OPERATE THE VINEYARD--

06:56.041 --> 06:58.417
NEW EQUIPMENT, INSURANCE,
SALARIES--

06:58.417 --> 07:02.917
IT'S ACTUALLY COSTING YOU
ABOUT $1,100 A BOTTLE.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.583
- I-I CAN'T SELL
THE VINEYARD.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.583
FIRST OF ALL,
MY NAME IS ON THE LABEL.

07:09.583 --> 07:14.375
PLUS I GOT, LIKE, $15,000 WORTH
OF SWEATSHIRTS AND T-SHIRTS

07:14.375 --> 07:16.583
AND HATS WITH MY LOGO ON IT.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.917
NO, NOT SELLING IT.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.000
IT'S OFF THE TABLE.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.750
- ALL RIGHT, THERE'S THE PLANE.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.333
- NO.
- IT'S A HUGE--

07:23.333 --> 07:24.583
- NO, THE PLANE IS
OFF THE TABLE.

07:24.583 --> 07:28.500
- BUT--
- MOVE ON.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.333
- I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS
THE POSSIBILITY

07:32.333 --> 07:34.250
OF LIQUIDATING
THE CAR COLLECTION.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.959
- FUCK YOU.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.208
- OKAY.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.750
- SO THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.625
- NOT EVEN NEAR THE TABLE.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.166
- BUT YOU'RE PREPARED TO EVICT
YOUR FATHER?

07:42.166 --> 07:45.250
- NOT ONE OF THOSE CARS
IS AN ASSHOLE.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.417
- LET'S KEEP GOING.

07:47.417 --> 07:51.750
- WE'RE SHOWING
YOU SPENT $126,000

07:51.750 --> 07:55.291
ON A SINGLE BOTTLE OF BRANDY
ONCE OWNED BY AL CAPONE?

07:55.291 --> 07:56.625
- A LITTLE PIECE OF HISTORY.

07:56.625 --> 07:59.625
- CAN YOU SEE YOURSELF
PARTING WITH IT?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.125
- I DRANK IT.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.500
- AH.
- I WAS DRUNK. IT WAS THERE.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.750
AS A BUSINESS DECISION,
IT'S HARD TO DEFEND.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.000
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.709
THIS DID NOTHING FOR ME.

08:16.709 --> 08:19.166
- I AGREE.
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE US.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.375
- I LIKED IT.
- REALLY?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.750
- I LIKE THE RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.542
I LIKE THE PHYSICAL COMEDY.
IT FEELS FRESH.

08:26.542 --> 08:30.834
- BUT DO WE REALLY WANT TO DO
A SHOW WITH PUPPETS?

08:30.834 --> 08:35.458
- PUPPETS?

08:35.458 --> 08:38.458
OH.
- [knocking]

08:38.458 --> 08:41.625
UH, HELEN BASCH IS HERE
TO SEE YOU?

08:41.625 --> 08:46.250
- HELEN'S HERE?
OH, MY GOD, SEND HER IN.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.959
- "AM I INTERRUPTING?"
SAID THE WOMAN

08:47.959 --> 08:49.291
WHO'S CLEARLY INTERRUPTING.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.291
- [laughs]

08:50.291 --> 08:52.083
PLEASE, INTERRUPT AWAY.

08:52.083 --> 08:55.041
[laughter]

08:55.041 --> 08:56.458
SO, INTRODUCTIONS.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.333
OBVIOUSLY, HELEN BASCH.
ANDY BUTTON.

08:59.333 --> 09:02.250
- HI, CAN I HAVE A RAISE?
TOO SOON?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.208
[laughter]

09:04.208 --> 09:05.208
- AND MYRA LICHT.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.625
- ACTUALLY, MYRA AND I

09:06.625 --> 09:08.750
MET LAST YEAR
AT THE ASPEN COMEDY FESTIVAL.

09:08.750 --> 09:09.875
- OKAY.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.000
- AND NOW LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE--

09:12.000 --> 09:13.208
- WHAT?

09:13.208 --> 09:15.542
- GOING TO BE WORKING TOGETHER.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.750
- YES, CAN'T WAIT.
SO EXCITED.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.166
- MM.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.208
- YOU GOT QUITE THE CREW HERE.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.750
[all chuckle]

09:23.750 --> 09:27.542
- ALL RIGHTY, HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS
GIVE US A FEW MINUTES?

09:27.542 --> 09:30.166
- SO NICE MEETING YOU.
TOTALLY KIDDING ABOUT THE RAISE.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.750
SORT OF.
[laughter]

09:31.750 --> 09:33.041
- I'LL SEE YOU BOTH SOON.

09:33.041 --> 09:35.333
- BYE-BYE.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.542
- OH.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.709
- OH, MY GOD.
I TOTALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS--

09:41.709 --> 09:44.750
- SHE'S NEVER SAID,
AND WE'RE ALL AFRAID TO ASK.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.583
- WELL, SOMETHING'S GOING ON
IN THERE.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.333
IF SHE'S NOT HAVING ONE,
SHE DEFINITELY ATE ONE.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.250
[laughter]

09:52.250 --> 09:55.208
- SO, SIT, SIT, SIT.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.250
WE ARE ALL SO THRILLED
YOU ARE HERE.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.750
- AW, THANK YOU.

10:00.750 --> 10:04.125
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I NEED
TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.875
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM?

10:06.875 --> 10:09.041
- OH, SURE.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.625
I WISH I'D BROUGHT PEANUTS.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.250
[both laugh]

10:12.250 --> 10:16.917
OKAY, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
I AM SO SORRY.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.250
IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME
AND UNDO IT, I WOULD.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.125
THERE IS NO EXCUSE.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.583
I WAS YOUNG.
I WAS NAIVE.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.709
OKAY, THOSE ARE BOTH EXCUSES.
[chuckles]

10:27.709 --> 10:30.750
BUT IT WAS MY FIRST REAL JOB.

10:30.750 --> 10:34.375
HE WAS POWERFUL AND EXCITING,

10:34.375 --> 10:37.875
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.250
- NOPE.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.458
- HOW MANY ELEPHANTS
ARE IN HERE?

10:42.458 --> 10:45.625
[both laugh]

10:48.291 --> 10:49.208
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.917
- ONE SEC.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.792
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.166
- MATT LEBLANC IS HERE
TO SEE YOU.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.083
- THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.834
- THE WHAT?

11:04.834 --> 11:07.458
- SO, TO WHAT DO WE OWE
THE PLEASURE

11:07.458 --> 11:09.333
OR WHATEVER IT IS
WE'RE ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE?

11:09.333 --> 11:11.250
- WE'D OFFER YOU A SEAT,
BUT, UM--

11:11.250 --> 11:13.291
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHITTY COUCH?

11:13.291 --> 11:15.291
- WE KNOW WHEN WE CAME BACK
FROM LONDON, IT WAS GONE,

11:15.291 --> 11:18.125
SO, UH, PULL UP A BOX.

11:20.625 --> 11:21.542
WHAT'S UP?

11:21.542 --> 11:22.917
- I KIND OF NEED A FAVOR.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.333
- NO.
- MAYBE LET HIM ASK FIRST?

11:25.333 --> 11:27.500
- THANK YOU.
- FINE.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.709
WHAT?

11:28.709 --> 11:30.458
- I NEED YOU TO TALK
TO ANDREW LESLEY.

11:30.458 --> 11:31.750
- FUCK OFF.
- [laughing] NO WAY.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.709
- LOOK, HE WON'T LET ME DO
HIS PILOT

11:33.709 --> 11:35.625
'CAUSE HE THINKS I'M STILL DOING
OUR PIECE OF CRAP.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.917
- OH, THANK YOU.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.834
- YOU GOT TO CONVINCE HIM
OURS IS DEAD.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.250
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU GUYS.
YOU GOT THE HISTORY.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.291
- NO, FORGET IT.

11:42.291 --> 11:43.709
THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE SPEAKING

11:43.709 --> 11:46.500
TO THAT SMUG, DUPLICITOUS,
TALKING SCARF.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.667
- I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
"WHEN PIGS FLY OUT OF YOUR ASS,"

11:48.667 --> 11:51.375
BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU EAT,
SO IT'S NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY.

11:51.375 --> 11:52.667
- COME ON!
I'M DESPERATE HERE.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.875
THEY WANT ME TO SELL
MY VINEYARD!

11:54.875 --> 11:56.166
- YOU HAVE A VINEYARD?

11:56.166 --> 11:58.500
- I NEVER GAVE YOU A BOTTLE?
both: NO.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.542
- WELL, YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GETTING A BOTTLE

12:00.542 --> 12:03.041
AND A SWEATSHIRT
AND A HAT.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.291
- I'M EXCITED.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.667
- IF YOU NEED MONEY SO BADLY,

12:05.667 --> 12:06.542
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SELL
YOUR PLANE?

12:06.542 --> 12:09.208
- THE PLANE IS OFF THE TABLE!

12:09.208 --> 12:13.083
WHAT I NEED IS WORK.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.709
LOOK, I REALIZE
WHAT I'M ASKING,

12:14.709 --> 12:16.750
BUT IT'S A FEW MINUTES
OF YOUR TIME,

12:16.750 --> 12:20.834
AND IT WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING
TO ME, COME ON.

12:20.834 --> 12:23.208
- FINE, WE'LL CALL HIM.
- YOU GOT TO DO IT IN PERSON.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.709
- FUCK OFF.
- IN PERSON? NO FUCKING WAY.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.125
- MY AGENT CALLED HIM.
MY MANAGER CALLED HIM.

12:27.125 --> 12:28.542
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
OVER THE PHONE.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.709
IT'S GOT TO BE FACE-TO-FACE.

12:29.709 --> 12:34.750
- NO.
- FUCK OFF.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.667
- IF YOU DO THIS FOR ME,

12:36.667 --> 12:39.083
I WILL TAKE YOU TO
A GOLDEN GLOBES GIFTING SUITE.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.041
- SAY MORE.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.750
- WAIT, WAIT.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.750
SO YOU DIDN'T MAKE HIM BREAK UP
WITH ME?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.542
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A YOU.

12:48.542 --> 12:51.583
- AND YOU DIDN'T MAKE HIM
FIRE ME?

12:51.583 --> 12:53.792
- I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
IF I'D KNOWN.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.083
DOES THAT HELP?

12:55.083 --> 13:01.375
- SO HE DID ALL THAT
JUST TO STOP SEEING ME?

13:01.375 --> 13:02.834
OH, MY GOD!

13:02.834 --> 13:05.542
- LOOK, I GET THAT
YOU LOVED HIM,

13:05.542 --> 13:08.625
AND I KNOW
THIS IS HARD TO HEAR,

13:08.625 --> 13:13.750
BUT ED WAS AN EMOTIONALLY
STUNTED, COMPULSIVELY LYING,

13:13.750 --> 13:16.375
EVIL SACK OF SHIT.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.333
- HE SEEMED SO NICE.

13:18.333 --> 13:21.542
- HEY, AT LEAST YOU GOT OUT.
I'M STILL PAYING HIM ALIMONY.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.542
[scoffs]
- [chuckles]

13:23.542 --> 13:25.291
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

13:25.291 --> 13:28.375
UH, WHAT WAS YOUR ELEPHANT?

13:28.375 --> 13:32.125
- OH, I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR ANOTHER JOB,

13:32.125 --> 13:35.583
AND I WAS GONNA CONVINCE YOU
TO STAY.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.792
- AH.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.000
[chuckles]

13:38.000 --> 13:39.542
[phone rings]

13:39.542 --> 13:41.792
- GOOD AFTERNOON,
ANDREW LESLEY'S OFFICE.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.792
PLEASE HOLD.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.917
- HELLO, WE'RE--
- SEAN AND BEVERLY LINCOLN.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.333
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.333
ANDREW, THEY'RE HERE.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.458
- OH, MY GOD.

13:53.458 --> 13:57.166
LOOK AT YOU!
IN MY OFFICE!

13:57.166 --> 13:58.417
MY MENTORS!

13:58.417 --> 14:00.667
YENZ, HOW MUCH DO I TALK
ABOUT THESE TWO?

14:00.667 --> 14:02.875
- ALL THE TIME.
- ALL THE TIME.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.083
- WELL, WE TALK ABOUT YOU
A FAIR BIT TOO.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.667
- OH.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.083
COME IN, COME IN, COME IN,
COME IN,

14:09.083 --> 14:10.375
COME IN, COME IN,
COME IN, COME IN.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.917
SIT, SIT, SIT.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.500
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SOFA.
IT'S TEMPORARY.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.250
THE ONE I ORDERED
IS TAKING FOREVER.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.417
[snores]

14:19.417 --> 14:20.959
HEADS WILL ROLL.
[laughs]

14:20.959 --> 14:22.417
OH, LOOK OUT FOR THE HEADS.

14:22.417 --> 14:23.667
[all chuckle]

14:23.667 --> 14:24.667
- ALL RIGHT.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.333
- HERE WE GO.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.834
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO--

14:28.834 --> 14:31.000
- PLEASE, WE DO IT EVERY DAY.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.417
ARE THESE YOURS?
- DON'T BE MAD.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.166
- YOU CAN JUST BUY THEM.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.583
- I KNOW, BUT YOU LIKE THEM.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.458
- YOU BAKED THESE?
- MM-HMM.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.208
- HE BAKED THESE.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.333
- I TOLD HIM HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
MARMALADE?

14:47.083 --> 14:49.333
THIS IS SUCH A TREAT.

14:49.333 --> 14:52.000
OH, BY THE WAY,
BRAVO ON THE SHOW.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.250
WE HEARD YOU WERE CANCELLED.
NOW YOU'RE NOT.

14:54.250 --> 14:58.208
MORE EPISODES OF PUCKS!
YAY.

14:58.208 --> 15:01.834
- ACTUALLY, UH,
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.542
WHATEVER THEY'RE SAYING
OFFICIALLY,

15:03.542 --> 15:06.125
OUR SHOW IS DEFINITELY OVER.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.041
- NO!

15:08.041 --> 15:09.917
I THOUGHT THEY ORDERED SIX MORE.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.834
- THEY DID,
BUT IT WAS JUST A PLOY

15:11.834 --> 15:14.208
TO KEEP MATT
FROM DOING YOUR SHOW.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.875
- THOSE BUGGERS.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.291
GUESS I'M MORE IMPORTANT
THAN I THOUGHT.

15:18.291 --> 15:19.250
[both chuckle]

15:19.250 --> 15:20.250
- I GUESS.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.000
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.583
SINCE OUR SHOW IS DEAD,
WE WANTED TO PUT IT OUT THERE--

15:26.583 --> 15:29.792
- OH, WOW.
AWKWARD!

15:29.792 --> 15:32.917
I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
HIRING WRITERS YET.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.417
- WHAT?

15:34.417 --> 15:35.750
- YOU KNOW I THINK
YOU'RE BOTH BEYOND BRILLIANT.

15:35.750 --> 15:36.959
IT'S JUST NOT QUITE
THE RIGHT FIT.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.291
- NO, NO--

15:38.291 --> 15:39.917
- I'M JUST GOING
FOR SOMETHING A BIT YOUNGER.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.250
- WE'RE NOT HERE
LOOKING FOR WORK.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.750
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.834
- ACTUALLY, WE HAVE A SHOW
THAT THREE NETWORKS

15:45.834 --> 15:46.834
ARE COMPETING FOR.

15:46.834 --> 15:48.875
- I'M SURE YOU DO.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.000
- WE'RE HERE ON MATT'S BEHALF.
- OH?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.625
- HE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KNOW PUCKS!  IS

15:53.625 --> 15:57.750
REALLY FINISHED, SO YOU MIGHT
RECONSIDER HIM FOR THE PART.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.709
- OH.
YEAH, THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.458
UNLESS HE'S LEGALLY FREE
AND CLEAR,

16:02.458 --> 16:03.792
THE NETWORK WILL NEVER GO
FOR IT.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.667
[whispers]
AND, UH, JUST BETWEEN US,

16:06.667 --> 16:08.458
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.250
[chuckles]

16:11.250 --> 16:12.583
LEMON CURD?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.417
- IT WAS SO LOVELY TO MEET YOU.

16:17.417 --> 16:18.542
SCONES FOR THE ROAD?
- NO, THANK YOU.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.792
- YEAH, FINE.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.166
- YOU'RE FIRED.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.166
- I'M WHAT?
- NOTHING.

16:35.709 --> 16:38.625
- HEY.
HOW'S OUR GUY DOING?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.208
- WELL, HE'S STILL STANDING.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.625
[whistle blows]

16:41.625 --> 16:44.875
- HE'S NO BECKHAM.
- NOT EVEN VICTORIA.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.583
- WHERE'S OLLIE?
- WORK.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.709
[whistle blows]

16:51.709 --> 16:52.917
- SO WHEN'S THE BIG DAY?

16:52.917 --> 16:54.667
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.000
- REALLY? I WAS KIND OF HOPING
TO GIVE YOU AWAY.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.291
IS HE RUNNING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION?

17:04.291 --> 17:07.166
- UH-HUH.

17:07.166 --> 17:11.792
- WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S GETTING EXERCISE.

17:11.792 --> 17:15.041
SO, UH, YOU GUYS SET A DATE YET?

17:15.041 --> 17:17.875
JUST ASKING.
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU.

17:17.875 --> 17:22.542
- NO, NO DATE.
IF IT HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.500
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- IT MEANS...

17:25.500 --> 17:27.125
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.
- WHAT?

17:27.125 --> 17:29.542
- MICHAEL!
HONEY, STAND UP!

17:29.542 --> 17:33.333
SOMEONE'S GONNA TRIP ON YOU!

17:33.333 --> 17:34.959
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN?

17:34.959 --> 17:36.583
- [sighs]

17:36.583 --> 17:39.834
LATELY IT JUST ISN'T FEELING
LIKE SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

17:39.834 --> 17:43.000
- THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU GOTTA MARRY HIM.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.542
IT'S--IT'S OLLIE!
- YOU NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.875
- I KNOW, BUT YOU SAID
HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY.

17:47.875 --> 17:52.542
- HE IS, BUT HE'S GOT ISSUES.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.000
- WHAT KIND OF ISSUES?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.125
- LIKE HOSTILITY ISSUES.
HE CAN BE MEAN.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.875
- MEAN.
WHO ISN'T MEAN?

18:00.875 --> 18:03.000
YOU'RE MEAN, I'M MEAN.
COME ON.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.417
- I'M TALKING MEAN.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.917
SOMETIMES THERE'S
A LOT OF RAGE THERE.

18:07.917 --> 18:11.458
- [clicks tongue]
DEFINE RAGE.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:13.208 --> 18:15.125
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO THROW AWAY
SOMETHING GOOD.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.750
- EVEN IF
HE'S SOMETIMES ABUSIVE?

18:16.750 --> 18:18.083
- WHAT KIND OF ABUSIVE?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.709
- WELL, NOT PHYSICALLY, BUT--

18:19.709 --> 18:22.417
- THEN WHAT ARE WE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

18:26.250 --> 18:29.458
- YOU TOLD HER TO GO BACK
TO THE MAN WITH THE RAGE?

18:29.458 --> 18:30.875
- SOMETIMES RAGE.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.667
- OKAY, FORGET DIANE.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.458
DO YOU REALLY WANT
YOUR CHILDREN GROWING UP

18:35.458 --> 18:38.583
IN THIS POTENTIALLY
UNHAPPY SITUATION

18:38.583 --> 18:41.875
WITH THIS ABUSIVE MAN?

18:41.875 --> 18:43.959
- THE SAVINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.875
- FOR WHICH YOU'RE PREPARED
TO CONSIGN THEM

18:45.875 --> 18:47.625
TO A MISERABLE CHILDHOOD?

18:47.625 --> 18:51.959
- IT'S CHILDHOOD.
IT'S OVER BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

18:51.959 --> 18:54.166
- YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
GIVEN SPERM.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.792
- LOOK, OBVIOUSLY
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE

18:56.792 --> 18:59.041
ON YOUR CHILDREN'S HAPPINESS,

18:59.041 --> 19:00.417
BUT IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.792
THEY SHOWED ME A SPREADSHEET.

19:03.792 --> 19:06.208
- I'M OUT.

19:06.208 --> 19:10.083
OH, GUESS WHO WE SAW TODAY IN
ALL HIS UNRELENTING SMARMINESS.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.375
- YOU SAW ANDREW LESLEY?
- UH-HUH.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.583
- AND?
- IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.375
- WHAT?

19:14.375 --> 19:15.750
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE LEGALLY
CONTRACTED TO OUR SHOW,

19:15.750 --> 19:16.625
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
GIVE YOU THE PART.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.834
- UGH.
"LEGALLY."

19:18.834 --> 19:20.542
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

19:20.542 --> 19:22.625
- UH, ENFORCEABLE BY LAW.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.458
- [mumbles mockingly]

19:24.458 --> 19:28.083
- THAT IS HARD TO ARGUE WITH.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.291
- OH.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.208
- WHAT'S THIS?

19:34.208 --> 19:36.166
- I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE
THANK-YOU GIFT FROM MY VINEYARD,

19:36.166 --> 19:39.041
EVEN THOUGH IT TURNS OUT THERE'S
NOTHING TO THANK YOU FOR.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.917
- "LEBLANC DE BLANC"?
- EH?

19:41.917 --> 19:45.625
- I'M GUESSING
IT'S NOT A VERY COMPLEX WINE.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.959
- WHY ARE YOU EVEN BOTHERING TO
MEET WITH THOSE OTHER NETWORKS?

19:51.959 --> 19:54.166
- BECAUSE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,

19:54.166 --> 19:55.709
WE'RE NOT GIVING OUR SHOW
TO YOURS.

19:55.709 --> 19:58.792
- WHAT?
YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO US.

19:58.792 --> 19:59.750
- BECAUSE WHY?

19:59.750 --> 20:02.000
- WHAT ABOUT THIS?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.750
- YEAH, THAT HASN'T EXACTLY PAID
BIG DIVIDENDS

20:04.750 --> 20:07.667
ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.875
- OKAY, HOW IS IT GOING TO LOOK
TO MY NEW BOSS

20:10.875 --> 20:14.542
IF MY BEST FRIEND GIVES HER SHOW
TO SOMEONE ELSE?

20:14.542 --> 20:16.792
- I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND?

20:16.792 --> 20:19.208
- WELL, PROBABLY.

20:19.208 --> 20:22.291
WHO'S YOUR BEST FRIEND?
- UH...

20:22.291 --> 20:28.125
I DON'T HAVE A BEST FRIEND
BECAUSE I'M NOT SEVEN.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.667
- YOU CAN BE VERY HURTFUL.

20:29.667 --> 20:30.875
- [laughs]

20:30.875 --> 20:32.041
- [laughs mockingly]

20:35.667 --> 20:37.792
YOU'LL SEE.

20:37.792 --> 20:39.083
- I'LL SEE WHAT?

20:39.083 --> 20:41.041
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US
THAT SHOW.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.834
- BECAUSE YOU DID SUCH A BANG-UP
JOB WITH OUR LAST SHOW?

20:43.834 --> 20:47.667
- HA HA.
NO, BECAUSE HELEN'S AMAZING.

20:47.667 --> 20:51.125
SHE'S THE BEST EXECUTIVE
I'VE EVER WORKED WITH.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.875
- YOU REALIZE HOW LOW
THE BAR IS?

20:52.875 --> 20:56.625
- I DO, YES.
I DO.

21:03.917 --> 21:04.834
- HEY.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.625
- HEY.
- ARE THEY READY?

21:07.625 --> 21:10.625
- GUYS, COME GET YOUR STUFF.
DADDY'S HERE!

21:10.625 --> 21:12.792
UH, DON'T FORGET
AIDEN'S GOT THAT,

21:12.792 --> 21:14.583
UH, WHATCHAMACALLIT
THIS AFTERNOON.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.250
- OH, RIGHT.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.417
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:18.417 --> 21:20.500
- OH, YOU WANT SOME?
- NO.

21:20.500 --> 21:25.125
THEY'RE HIS VITAMINS.
THEY'RE CHILDREN'S VITAMINS.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.834
- REALLY GOOD.

21:26.834 --> 21:30.083
SO, UH, WHERE ARE WE WITH OLLIE?

21:30.083 --> 21:32.875
- SERIOUSLY?
AGAIN WITH OLLIE?

21:32.875 --> 21:35.792
- I'M SORRY, I'M INVESTED.

21:35.792 --> 21:38.250
SO--

21:38.250 --> 21:40.625
- IT'S OVER.
- OV--WH--

21:40.625 --> 21:42.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN OVER?
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.750
- BUT WE DECIDED YOU WERE GONNA
GIVE IT A CHANCE.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.208
- I GAVE IT A CHANCE.
BOYS!

21:47.208 --> 21:49.750
- OKAY, IS THIS STILL
ABOUT THE ABUSIVE THING?

21:49.750 --> 21:52.750
'CAUSE, NO OFFENSE,
SOMETIMES YOUR EXPECTATIONS

21:52.750 --> 21:56.083
CAN BE A LITTLE UNREALISTIC.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.750
- AIDEN, MICHAEL, MOVE IT!

21:57.750 --> 21:59.250
YOUR FATHER'S STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.208
- SO THAT'S IT?
IT'S JUST--JUST OVER?

22:02.208 --> 22:03.834
- YEAH. OVER.

22:03.834 --> 22:07.125
- OH, JESUS.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.000
- ARE THOSE TEARS IN YOUR EYES?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.333
- THIS IS VERY UPSETTING.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.959
- HI, GUYS.
SO SORRY I'M LATE.

22:17.959 --> 22:19.417
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD?

22:19.417 --> 22:23.166
- OH, IT'S FINE.
I JUST FELL OFF MY DESK.

22:23.166 --> 22:25.041
- IF EVERYBODY'S HERE,
THEY'RE READY.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.917
- GREAT.
AFTER YOU.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.000
- WE LOVE THIS SHOW.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.834
- OH, THAT'S VERY KIND.
- OH, THANK YOU.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.834
- IT'S FUNNY.
IT'S CLEVER.

22:33.834 --> 22:36.291
YOU CAN TOTALLY TELL
THAT ENGLISH PEOPLE WROTE IT.

22:36.291 --> 22:38.834
EVERYTHING YOU ALL DO
IS SO SMART.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.959
- AND YET YOU FELT YOU NEEDED
YOUR OWN COUNTRY.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.083
[laughter]

22:42.083 --> 22:45.000
- EXACTLY.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.208
- ONE QUESTION
WE DO HAVE THOUGH,

22:47.208 --> 22:53.250
THE DOUBLING, WHERE ALL
THE ACTORS PLAY TWO PARTS...

22:53.250 --> 22:55.542
- IT'S NOT QUITE
A QUESTION YET.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.709
- ARE YOU MARRIED TO THAT?

22:57.709 --> 22:58.875
- HAPPILY.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.417
- YEAH, WITHOUT THE DOUBLING,

23:00.417 --> 23:02.417
IT'S REALLY JUST A SHOW
ABOUT TWO FAMILIES.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.792
- THE DOUBLING'S
WHAT MAKES IT DISTINCTIVE.

23:04.792 --> 23:07.709
- OR...GIMMICKY?

23:07.709 --> 23:10.417
- I'M GONNA STICK
WITH DISTINCTIVE,

23:10.417 --> 23:14.959
BUT I'LL GO TO MY GRAVE
REMEMBERING GIMMICKY.

23:14.959 --> 23:17.917
[all chuckling]

23:20.166 --> 23:22.291
- WE LOVE THIS.
IT'S YUMMY.

23:22.291 --> 23:24.375
IT'S DELICIOUS.
I WANT TO EAT IT.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.375
IT'S THAT DELICIOUS.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.375
- OH, THANK YOU.
- BON APPETIT.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.250
- THERE ARE SOME GREAT PARTS
IN HERE.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.875
I THINK WE CAN ATTRACT
SOME MAJOR TALENT.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.458
- MM-HMM.

23:33.458 --> 23:37.458
- ACTUALLY, UM,
AFTER OUR EXPERIENCE ON PUCKS!,

23:37.458 --> 23:41.208
WE'RE NOT REALLY KEEN
ON GOING WITH BIG NAMES.

23:41.208 --> 23:44.458
- GOT IT.
TOTALLY HEAR YOU.

23:44.458 --> 23:48.000
BUT SAY WE COULD GET SOMEONE
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.333
ANTHONY HOPKINS
FOR THE FATHER...

23:50.333 --> 23:54.667
- UH, RIGHT,
BUT HE WOULD BE A BIG NAME.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.417
- NO, OF COURSE.
I DON'T MEAN HIM PER SE.

23:57.417 --> 24:01.542
I'M TALKING
ABOUT AN ANTHONY HOPKINS TYPE.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.458
- OH, WELL,
THAT WOULD BE FINE.

24:03.458 --> 24:08.083
- LIKE DONALD SUTHERLAND.

24:08.083 --> 24:11.208
- AGAIN, THAT'S A BIG NAME.

24:11.208 --> 24:12.959
- GOTCHA.
I'M WITH YOU.

24:12.959 --> 24:16.583
I--I JUST MEAN SOMEONE
DONALD SUTHERLAND-ESQUE.

24:16.583 --> 24:21.166
- OKAY.
- LIKE CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER.

24:21.166 --> 24:22.959
- AGAIN--
- YEAH, YEAH.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

24:24.333 --> 24:25.750
- [chuckles]

24:25.750 --> 24:29.291
I THINK WE DO.

24:29.291 --> 24:32.125
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THIS IS FANTASTIC.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.583
IT'S SOPHISTICATED
AND HILARIOUS,

24:34.583 --> 24:36.291
AND YOU'VE BEEN HEARING
THAT STUFF ALL DAY LONG.

24:36.291 --> 24:38.417
- BUT NOT YET TIRED OF IT.
[laughter]

24:38.417 --> 24:40.375
- WELL,
KUDOS ON BEING BRILLIANT.

24:40.375 --> 24:43.959
NOW, WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE
FOR US?

24:43.959 --> 24:46.125
- UM...
- UH...

24:46.125 --> 24:47.667
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT COULD GO
THAT WAY.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.542
REFRESHING!
- [laughs]

24:49.542 --> 24:51.625
- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

24:51.625 --> 24:54.291
- UH, OKAY.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.417
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED
THAT WE MIGHT WANT

24:56.417 --> 24:58.417
TO ELIMINATE THE DOUBLING.

24:58.417 --> 25:02.000
- WHY? I LOVE THE DOUBLING.
THE DOUBLING IS THE KEY.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.917
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST A SHOW
ABOUT TWO FAMILIES.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.542
- EXACTLY.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.667
- UH, ANY THOUGHTS ON CASTING?

25:09.667 --> 25:12.041
- I ALREADY TOLD THESE GUYS
I SHOWED THE SCRIPT

25:12.041 --> 25:15.500
TO SUSAN SARANDON,
WHO WAS VERY HOT ON IT.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.709
- I MENTIONED GOLDIE HAWN,
ALTHOUGH SHE'S NO LONGER

25:17.709 --> 25:19.917
A CLIENT,
SO I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.417
- LOOK, WE'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT,

25:22.417 --> 25:26.917
BUT ARE YOU DEAD SET
ON GOING WITH BIG NAMES?

25:26.917 --> 25:28.208
- UH, NO.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.208
- I FEEL LIKE,
WITH A SCRIPT THIS STRONG,

25:29.208 --> 25:30.709
YOU DON'T NEED NAMES.

25:30.709 --> 25:34.333
I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK
AT JUST ABOUT ANY BIG COMEDY

25:34.333 --> 25:36.250
FROM THE LAST 20 YEARS,
THEY STARTED OUT

25:36.250 --> 25:38.875
WITH REALLY GOOD ACTORS
AND MADE THEM STARS,

25:38.875 --> 25:40.291
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.208
- INTERESTING.
- HEY.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.709
AND IF THE SHOW'S A HIT, YOU'LL
END UP PAYING THEM JUST AS MUCH,

25:44.709 --> 25:48.125
AND THEY'LL WIND UP JUST
AS CRAZY, SO WHY START THERE?

25:48.125 --> 25:50.000
THIS IS YOUR STAR.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.875
- LOOK AT YOU, ALL SMUG.
- NOT SMUG, HAPPY.

25:56.875 --> 26:00.208
ALL RIGHT,
80% HAPPY, 20% SMUG,

26:00.208 --> 26:02.041
WITH A LITTLE EXTRA SMUG
IN RESERVE.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.709
[elevator bell dings]
OOH.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.709
OH, COME ON, SHE'S FANTASTIC.

26:06.709 --> 26:08.750
THERE'S NOTHING REMOTELY FUCKWIT
ABOUT HER.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.667
[elevator bell dings]

26:11.667 --> 26:16.542
- SO, WAS I RIGHT?
SHE'S GREAT, RIGHT?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.709
[elevator bell dings]
- SHE'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.625
- AND?

26:20.625 --> 26:22.250
- AND SHE CLEARLY GETS

26:22.250 --> 26:25.875
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE SHOW.
[elevator bell dinging]

26:25.875 --> 26:27.250
- SO?

26:27.250 --> 26:29.583
[buzzer]

26:32.625 --> 26:35.250
- WELL, COMPARED TO
THE OTHER IDIOTS WE MET TODAY,

26:35.250 --> 26:37.875
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
HEAD AND SHOULDERS--

26:37.875 --> 26:41.583
- OH, JESUS, JUST TELL ME
WE'RE GETTING THE FUCKING SHOW.

26:44.875 --> 26:46.458
- [sighs]

26:46.458 --> 26:51.750
I HAVE GRAVE MISGIVINGS,
IT'S PROBABLY A HUGE MISTAKE,

26:51.750 --> 26:54.333
AND I'M SURE THERE'LL COME A DAY
WHEN I REGRET THIS.

26:54.333 --> 26:57.709
- SO IT'S A YES!
YAY!

26:59.333 --> 27:00.542
[laughs]

27:06.041 --> 27:08.083
- HEY, JOSE.

27:12.417 --> 27:14.500
YOU KNOW I THINK
YOU'RE FANTASTIC,

27:14.500 --> 27:16.458
AND THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

27:16.458 --> 27:21.125
I MEAN, THIS BEACH IS--

27:21.125 --> 27:23.125
[chuckles]

27:23.125 --> 27:25.041
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
I'M HAVING TO MAKE

27:25.041 --> 27:27.458
SOME TOUGH FINANCIAL DECISIONS.

27:27.458 --> 27:28.625
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SAW THE TRADES,

27:28.625 --> 27:30.333
BUT THERE'S BEEN
A WHOLE SCANDAL.

27:30.333 --> 27:33.667
MY BUSINESS MANAGER
TOTALLY FUCKED ME OVER, AND--

27:33.667 --> 27:36.959
WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINE,
IT'S BEEN A NIGHTMARE.

27:36.959 --> 27:40.834
THEY WANT ME TO SELL MY PLANE.
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.625
YOU GOT TO DRAW A LINE
SOMEWHERE.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.458
[chuckles]

27:44.458 --> 27:49.208
BUT SADLY I DO HAVE TO MAKE
SOME CUTBACKS.

27:49.208 --> 27:52.917
SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR 18 YEARS.

27:52.917 --> 27:57.917
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT TODAY
NEEDS TO BE OUR LAST DAY.

27:57.917 --> 28:00.750
IF YOU COULD JUST GRAB
THAT LITTLE BIT OF SEAWEED SHIT

28:00.750 --> 28:03.875
OVER THERE,
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

28:03.875 --> 28:07.792
ALSO, I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S YOUR RAKE OR MY RAKE,

28:07.792 --> 28:12.500
BUT BY ALL MEANS--HUH?

28:12.500 --> 28:15.166
AND AGAIN, THANK YOU.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.166
OH, THERE'S PART
OF A DEAD SEAGULL OVER THERE.

28:19.166 --> 28:22.709
IF YOU COULD JUST GRAB THAT,
THAT'D BE GREAT, YEAH?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.834
[keys clacking]

28:30.834 --> 28:33.709
[quirky music]

28:33.709 --> 28:41.834
