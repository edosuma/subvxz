Millennium was the end
too much.

00:30.458 --> 00:35.375
Natural resources dried up, the global
financial markets collapsed,

00:35.458 --> 00:39.292
And the crisis has united
human destiny-

00:39.375 --> 00:43.083
Left-isolated individuals
in its decay.

00:45.917 --> 00:50.292
Trexx group said that the peace
movement and would save us-

00:50.417 --> 00:54.167
And therefore linked together
all European metro-

00:54.250 --> 00:57.167
-Into a huge system - the Metro.

01:34.958 --> 01:39.292
<i>I hope I have helped you

01:39.375 --> 01:43.583
<i>"I have new responsibilities and...
-Okay. Absolutely.</i>

01:43.667 --> 01:46.958
But... we respect your decision
fully.

01:47.041 --> 01:50.750
Everything we do is based on the respect.

01:54.916 --> 01:58.791
<i>If I understand right you think
that it is too time consuming.</i>

01:58.875 --> 02:03.916
<i>-Or has your time been...
"I just have not time.</i>

02:06.458 --> 02:09.625
We have many queued, so...

02:09.791 --> 02:13.541
This should be great fun. Damn!

02:23.208 --> 02:26.208
-You know what I know?
-Monitors me?

02:26.291 --> 02:31.875
-Yes. And you know what I know about you?
"I have lost two clients.

02:31.958 --> 02:38.000
We're talking about something else. You know what
I have heard? Not that it concerns me.

02:38.083 --> 02:44.541
"But it is said that you have covered.
-Maybe once. It's not...

02:44.625 --> 02:48.583
Legally. It is not without reason;
if you ask me.

02:48.666 --> 02:54.875
Who told you that?
Was it Monica? It was Monica, eh?

02:54.958 --> 03:00.166
You know what I was doing
your age? You can never guess.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.666

-That you left it as passengers?

04:24.083 --> 04:29.708
<i>It was perhaps in one of our Metro-
trucks from Paris to Stockholm.</i>

-One of 10 000.
-No, must be one type of 10 000.

05:50.499 --> 05:53.583
God, you're worse than me.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.666
Sorry.

05:56.749 --> 06:00.874
Yes, of course, I promise.

06:00.958 --> 06:04.041
I have to go. No.

-Please!

06:16.416 --> 06:20.249
-Was it your mom?
-No, it was Charles.

06:20.333 --> 06:23.249
He has met a new girl again.

06:24.916 --> 06:28.874
-So the other day that she was near-sighted...
-Mrs.

06:28.999 --> 06:33.374

-Nothing... just check out his hair.

06:38.291 --> 06:41.208
-His hair?
-Dreadlocks?

06:41.333 --> 06:45.791
If he was black or Cuban
or something - anything.

06:45.874 --> 06:49.791
But he is from Finland! Finland!

06:51.249 --> 06:55.624
"I do not know, but do not you think...
-No.

Huh?

07:05.333 --> 07:11.041
You are the only bikes.
For that there is something fishy in the Metro.

27:05.414 --> 27:08.331
30 words.

27:08.664 --> 27:15.039
-The inclusion of these words?
-What? No, just answer the question.

27:19.247 --> 27:23.539
Stefan. Stefan!
What are you doing here?

27:23.622 --> 27:26.831
-My name is not Stephen.
And my name is not Daniel.

27:26.914 --> 27:31.206
I have not seen you since Eve celebration.
Do you remember that?

27:31.289 --> 27:38.664
I know you were so fucking gone.
You have left the stain from... you know.

27:38.747 --> 27:43.789
On your shirt there. It was
A long time ago. It's quite disgusting.

27:44.122 --> 27:47.539
Four contestants.
Only one can stay.

27:47.664 --> 27:49.289
Call me.

27:49.372 --> 27:52.997
It's so... so...

27:56.247 --> 27:58.872
-Yes?
-No, wait.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.914
I think I know.

28:05.747 --> 28:08.789
Yes. You are kind to animals and dogs.

28:41.039 --> 28:43.956
Now it's your turn.

28:44.039 --> 28:45.997
30 words.

28:53.664 --> 28:58.414
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Do not even think about it.</i>

28:58.914 --> 29:01.747
<i>Europe's top-lmage uthyrnlng.</i>

29:01.831 --> 29:06.497
<i>Let's spread the fame of

<i>Rent beautiful and charismatic friends.

<i>Do not let your life medelmåttlga

30:19.997 --> 30:25.955
-Can I help you sir?
-Yes please. Can you give this to...

30:26.039 --> 30:28.830
It is not part of my job.

30:28.914 --> 30:33.914
So you take responsibility
because she did not get it?

30:38.039 --> 30:40.039
Thank you.

30:50.164 --> 30:55.289
Put your finger here
and look into the camera.

31:05.747 --> 31:11.455
-How did you get here?
"There, I also wonder.

31:11.539 --> 31:17.580
When I tried to get the doorman to
give you this. You forgot the past.

31:17.664 --> 31:24.039
He thought it was well... He thought
Maybe it was drugs or something.

31:32.539 --> 31:35.580
Ivan Bahn.

31:35.705 --> 31:38.580
I'll be brief.

31:38.664 --> 31:43.705
Preliminary reports of Trexx-
group, including Trexx Systems

31:43.830 --> 31:49.039
Lnvoice-Communications and Dangst
Cosmetics, show fourth-quarter

31:49.122 --> 31:54.205
-Sales of EUR 63.2 billion.
With a net profit of 12.3 billion.

31:54.289 --> 31:58.497
-What are all the people?
"He who chews with his mouth open...

31:58.580 --> 32:03.872
It is Cedrik Vanderklark.
Chairman of the Nature & Mind.

32:03.955 --> 32:10.164
He hat in front of him
Wayne Marshall is from Texas.

32:10.289 --> 32:15.705
He owns the Foodland, and Healthy Pizza
half of Texas and can not even read.

32:15.789 --> 32:22.205
Mr Naruse owns Bank of Osaka,
which owns and GlobalNet Globocom.

32:22.330 --> 32:25.330
More powerful than God in Asia.

32:25.414 --> 32:30.372
Joseph Kempf.
More vain than a 16-year-old girl.

32:30.455 --> 32:37.455
Cardinal of the Church of Climate, guru
all the stupid climatologists.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.122
Why is everybody here?

32:40.205 --> 32:45.539
l days using
over 400 million Europeans Metro.

32:45.622 --> 32:51.289
Welcome to the world's largest
mass transport.

32:56.330 --> 33:03.080
Trexx metro systems, infrastructural
Revolution, the biggest since the railways

33:03.205 --> 33:09.039
A peace project which has blurred the
final borders between the peoples of Europe.

33:09.122 --> 33:12.497
I've always seen Trexx
as a living organism.

33:12.580 --> 33:19.038
A body, but made of steel, stone and
concrete, with one heart and one soul.

33:19.122 --> 33:24.872
And the blood flowing in its veins
is Dangst.

33:24.955 --> 33:31.455
Allow me to demonstrate. Dandruff Shampoo
has only one known side effect.

33:33.038 --> 33:36.372
It gives dandruff.

33:55.788 --> 33:59.622
You just thought:

33:59.705 --> 34:05.830
"Did this man my hat
With wet fingers? "

34:05.913 --> 34:09.371
How... how did you do that?

34:09.455 --> 34:13.080
"I actually thought that.
-Taste.

34:16.455 --> 34:19.621
Well? How it tasted?

34:19.746 --> 34:25.246
Pungent. Almost rancid.
Quite simply: it is undrinkable.

34:26.496 --> 34:29.830
-Take a sip of.
-No thanks.

34:31.246 --> 34:32.955
Or...

34:37.955 --> 34:43.996
Wait. I do not.
It was like a voice in my head.

34:44.080 --> 34:50.080
Not my own voice - and it said:
"Drink. It is good."

34:50.538 --> 34:54.496
Wait. How did you do that?
How did you...

35:09.747 --> 35:14.247
I forgot to shut it down.
Not a problem, I'll just...

35:15.997 --> 35:18.080
Sorry about that.

35:18.163 --> 35:23.705
<i>-Is not it Nina Swartzcruit?
"I have a question.</i>

35:25.497 --> 35:32.788
Can someone using shampoo
take control of another human being?

35:33.872 --> 35:35.830
I do not understand.

35:35.913 --> 35:40.372
For example,
advantage of a young girl sexually.

35:40.455 --> 35:46.413
Convince her. Get her to believe
that she wants even though she does not want.

35:48.163 --> 35:51.538
Do you understand what I mean now?

35:57.663 --> 36:02.247
Dangst is a very powerful
communication tools.

36:02.330 --> 36:08.872
l the wrong hands can use tools
as a tool to harm others.

36:08.955 --> 36:12.372
I am prompted to ask you to go,
Miss Swartzcruit.

36:12.455 --> 36:16.830
-Did you hear me?
"I do not move if you go out.

36:16.913 --> 36:19.205
Are you blind? I walk.

36:33.872 --> 36:40.122
The voices that you talked about...
What do you know more about them?

36:40.205 --> 36:43.246
I thought you did not hear voices.

36:44.205 --> 36:48.205
Think you can handle the truth?

36:52.788 --> 36:55.996
<i>Hauptbahnhof, Berlin.</i>

37:27.955 --> 37:30.788
This is a private area.

37:35.163 --> 37:37.121
Miss Swartzcruit.

37:55.205 --> 37:57.830
Wow. Dangst.

38:13.330 --> 38:15.330
Damn!

38:55.288 --> 38:56.913
<i>Roger.</i>

38:58.246 --> 38:59.621
<i>Roger.</i>

39:01.621 --> 39:05.996
<i>-Roger? Hello?
-Who are you?</i>

39:07.080 --> 39:08.871
Who are you?

39:08.955 --> 39:11.330
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

39:14.955 --> 39:19.330
I will contact the authorities.
Perhaps the media. People should be told.

39:19.413 --> 39:23.830
Whatever they do, I know
that it is illegal.

39:25.330 --> 39:30.038
<i>They are the authorities.
They control governments, media...</i>

39:30.121 --> 39:33.371
I do not need the media, government agencies.
Nobody!

39:33.455 --> 39:35.871
What are you doing?

39:57.205 --> 39:59.788
Damn! Best we go!

39:59.871 --> 40:06.580
<i>This is a security alarm, code red.
Security staff to sector B.</i>

40:45.246 --> 40:48.413
There must be something we can do, huh?

40:49.371 --> 40:54.996
We can not talk - not here.
They listen to your thoughts.

41:01.121 --> 41:04.163
Come on. Come on!

41:04.246 --> 41:10.871
I should be safe now. If it goes
to 3.4, anything can happen.

41:10.954 --> 41:17.913
Sorry. What do you do if you lose
control over its subjects?

41:17.996 --> 41:20.621
It depends. What is it?

41:20.704 --> 41:26.079
Well... it may sound a bit strange-

41:26.163 --> 41:29.788
-But it feels as if
someone else controlling him.

41:29.871 --> 41:36.329
Okay... And you are sure you
not only to misjudge the situation?

41:36.413 --> 41:42.579
-No, something is wrong.
-You must talk to Ralph Parker.

42:33.538 --> 42:37.288
You know, I've been dreaming about you.

42:37.371 --> 42:41.746
We were kids. You had
a large red and green parrot.

42:41.829 --> 42:49.663
But it flew out a window and
disappeared in. .. a wood type.

42:49.746 --> 42:53.496
We walked around among the trees
and tried to catch it-

42:53.579 --> 42:59.121
-But all the time it was too high up,
so we could never catch it.

42:59.246 --> 43:04.454
You know something?
We actually had a parrot.

43:04.538 --> 43:09.954
It was red and orange
and light green on the belly.

43:10.038 --> 43:13.288
But it never went away.

43:15.329 --> 43:20.996
-Must be something we can do, huh?
-My plan puts an end to all this.

43:21.079 --> 43:26.913
I can help you get rid of the voice
permanently. But you must help me.

43:26.996 --> 43:29.454
"I'm just so...
-Scared?

43:29.579 --> 43:34.121
No. It is not there.
I'm just so normal.

43:34.204 --> 43:38.288
The guy who is dissatisfied with his life,
their job, their all-

43:38.371 --> 43:44.204
And can not blame someone else
because it's his own damn choice.

43:44.287 --> 43:47.204
If it is not your choice then?

43:49.287 --> 43:53.162
I decided
to follow after you.

44:11.912 --> 44:15.037
What had you done, Zelda?

44:15.121 --> 44:18.246
It is easy for you to say.

44:19.121 --> 44:24.537
No. No, I can not.
They kill him.

44:38.454 --> 44:44.912
Do not trust government officials.
But they turned on everything and...

44:44.996 --> 44:48.621
It is just an illusion...

45:02.246 --> 45:06.246
<i>Listen.
You do not know the truth about her.</i>

45:06.329 --> 45:10.371
<i>-She is a parasite.
-What does he say? The voice.</i>

45:10.496 --> 45:14.996
<i>-A parasite, Roger.
"I do not know... Many things.</i>

45:15.079 --> 45:19.537
<i>-It is best we hurry.
-Roger. Where are you?</i>

45:23.454 --> 45:25.371
<i>Will they come?</i>

45:30.121 --> 45:33.037
Listen carefully now, Roger Olofson.

45:33.121 --> 45:39.204
<i>My name is Stefan. I'm yours
inner voice. Your life is in danger.</i>

45:43.204 --> 45:46.871
She is not the
She claims to be.

45:46.954 --> 45:51.287
<i>For your sake
I am ready to meet you.</i>

45:51.371 --> 45:55.829
<i>But we can not be seen on lnvoice.
And Nina could not be with.</i>

45:56.746 --> 46:00.579
-What does he say?
-Whatever you do, please do not tell her.

46:00.662 --> 46:03.121
"He wants to meet me.
-Say no.

46:03.246 --> 46:06.621
-Why?
-You can not. Okay?

46:07.121 --> 46:09.621
-Okay, but...
-You must trust me.

46:09.704 --> 46:12.412
<i>-You can not see him.
-Why not?</i>

46:22.162 --> 46:24.787
Wait here.

46:27.662 --> 46:30.287
Follow her.

46:32.996 --> 46:39.912
I thought you fixed it. Now would
he hit him. What do I say?

46:40.037 --> 46:43.662
You'll see. What did I tell you?

46:44.829 --> 46:47.829
Okay, where we meet?

46:55.996 --> 46:57.496
Roger!

47:36.620 --> 47:41.287
Mr Parker-looking you.
-Good evening.

47:48.620 --> 47:50.120
Well?

47:51.412 --> 47:54.495
We have Bassas signature.

48:00.162 --> 48:05.120
-My God, what have I done...
Sign-in.

48:06.995 --> 48:10.370
The problem with Amelia has also been resolved.

48:10.454 --> 48:14.662
But we might not
reach an agreement.

48:19.537 --> 48:25.412
I assume that you know
incident in lngolstadt.

48:25.495 --> 48:29.620
Strengthening the review at the entrances
implemented at present.

48:29.745 --> 48:33.704
It can lead to some delay
in the program, but... 35 min.

48:33.787 --> 48:39.037
I did not ask how you will
clean up after your faux pas.

48:39.120 --> 48:43.204
I want to know how the
at all could happen.

48:43.287 --> 48:46.912
What would she have? More money?

48:47.037 --> 48:50.120
We can not buy us out of it now.

48:50.245 --> 48:55.120
-She is a killer, greedy...
-Do not forget who you're talking to.

48:55.204 --> 49:00.537
"I was just trying to...
-Tries... just do the weak.

49:00.620 --> 49:03.579
-Are you weak?
-No, sir.

49:03.662 --> 49:06.662
It is not personal.

49:06.745 --> 49:11.370
I care about functionality.
What is your role?

49:13.662 --> 49:15.245
Your safety, sir.

49:19.370 --> 49:24.495
-The damage is done.
-There will be no more incidents.

49:24.579 --> 49:29.287
We continue as planned. They are
to Scandinavia, at C14. 22:30.

49:29.370 --> 49:34.787
And where is the nudity?
-Yes, there will be nudity.

50:05.329 --> 50:09.370
-Did somebody after you?
-No, I do not think so.

50:10.829 --> 50:14.037
Hell, Satan... What the hell do I do?

50:14.120 --> 50:19.579
-Who are you?
-You must go home - now.

50:19.662 --> 50:23.454
-Who the hell are you?
"I am not.

50:25.704 --> 50:31.162
"I just work there.
-All this shit is totally sick!

50:32.787 --> 50:37.579
"They will kill you.
-What, then, kill me? Tell us.

50:37.662 --> 50:42.495
You make me completely confused!
What "they"? Ivan Bahn?

50:42.578 --> 50:46.953
Do not ask.
Please, forget all about it here.

50:47.037 --> 50:51.703
Why me? What have I done?
I'm a regular fucking Smith!

50:51.787 --> 50:57.120
Explain just what I have done.
Say... What have I done?!

50:57.203 --> 51:03.120
When I got your eye on my table
and saw your picture the first time-

51:03.203 --> 51:07.953
-I could not resist
to see how similar we are.

51:08.995 --> 51:12.537
Go home. So maybe we can cope.

51:12.662 --> 51:17.495
Why do you say no to them?
Why do you care about me?

51:17.578 --> 51:22.870
The longer you are working inside someone,
more difficult it becomes to distinguish-

51:22.953 --> 51:26.620
-On "me" and... "You".

51:28.287 --> 51:32.495
-Nina, then?
-What does she want you to do?

51:32.578 --> 51:37.912
"She helps me get rid of the voice.
-Type, permanently?

51:38.870 --> 51:40.953
-Are you going to kill me?
-No.

51:41.037 --> 51:45.870
Is it not strange that
She has not said who she is?

51:45.953 --> 51:51.745
-Has she never said...
-She is on the damn shampoo bottle.

51:51.828 --> 51:55.037
She is the daughter of Ivan Bahn.

51:55.120 --> 51:58.953
-Impossible.
-Why not ask her yourself?

52:06.828 --> 52:08.287
Satan.

52:22.287 --> 52:24.412
Roger! Wait.

52:24.495 --> 52:31.495
Roger... You just disappeared.
I have looked everywhere.

52:36.495 --> 52:40.495
I must go home now.
It has happened and something...

52:40.578 --> 52:45.787
"I must go home.
-So you thought, just dump me?

52:47.162 --> 52:51.037
I just have to go home now.

52:51.120 --> 52:55.370
I've been thinking a lot
and do not want anybody to get hurt.

52:55.453 --> 53:00.995
I understand, really. I know
that you have someone waiting at home.

53:01.078 --> 53:04.370
But I must tell you something.

53:04.453 --> 53:08.328
Come with me.
It does not take long. Please.

53:15.120 --> 53:19.662
I need you.
Perhaps more than you need me.

53:19.787 --> 53:27.703
Damn. I'm sorry.
I can not, I can not do it.

54:11.120 --> 54:14.620
<i>The number you have suggested
can unfortunately not be linked.</i>

54:16.870 --> 54:22.286
Why the hell do you answer no
when you know that I should call?

54:22.370 --> 54:26.661
Really?
And you want me to believe in it?

54:27.203 --> 54:30.828
Well, I mixed up the numbers?

54:30.911 --> 54:35.703
He is here.
He actually seems to be okay.

55:02.661 --> 55:06.245
Do you think I'm sexy?

55:24.161 --> 55:27.411
You can touch me.

55:40.203 --> 55:43.953
Damn. Did the bulbs?

55:45.578 --> 55:49.161
Or was it a fuse?

55:49.245 --> 55:54.745
-Damn. What should we do?
-Wait. Roger, come back.

55:59.745 --> 56:05.953
What the hell is happening here? We may
will stick. Or what do you think?

56:06.036 --> 56:08.953
"I do not like this.
-Who cares?

56:09.036 --> 56:13.953
"I do not like darkness.
-What?

56:14.036 --> 56:19.870
I really think we should go.
Listen...

56:20.870 --> 56:26.161
There is actually something else
I wanted to ask you.

56:26.245 --> 56:28.161
Unbelievable.

56:28.245 --> 56:31.953
I thought
that you had a girl at home.

56:32.078 --> 56:36.370
Yes, I have.
But it is not there.

56:37.495 --> 56:41.661
I was told
that you are Ivan Bahn's daughter.

57:09.411 --> 57:14.078
-Have you ever been in New York?
-By boat, you mean? Do you?

57:14.161 --> 57:20.578
Only in New York I can
come out and know just from the smell:

57:20.661 --> 57:23.161
"Yes, here I am."

57:23.245 --> 57:27.661
-Or in Paris, now, for example.
-Sure...

57:29.120 --> 57:33.870
You can believe whatever you want;
but I have not planned this.

57:33.953 --> 57:39.370
Although we would die
we have experienced this situation. Huh?

57:39.870 --> 57:45.286
Yes, but...
I actually planned not to die.

57:50.494 --> 57:57.536
Where the hell are you?! They rang from
job. You did not come this morning.

57:57.619 --> 58:03.036
I would just call the emergency room
to see if anything happened to you.

58:03.119 --> 58:07.786
... I called Karl. He offered
to keep me company until you came.

58:08.869 --> 58:11.744
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

58:11.828 --> 58:17.661
Is he still there?
You know what? It does not matter.

58:18.744 --> 58:20.703
Hello...?

58:33.994 --> 58:38.619
What do we do now?
Do you have... I do not know... a plan?

58:40.161 --> 58:43.661
You know what
a flux compression generator is?

58:43.744 --> 58:46.453
It generates an electromagnetic pulse

58:46.536 --> 58:52.119
-To eliminate all electronic
equipment within 500 meters radius.

58:52.244 --> 58:57.911
Kind of like a lightning bolt that strikes
in lnvoice headquarters.

58:57.994 --> 59:00.286
Nobody gets hurt.

59:00.369 --> 59:06.119
And I will be deleted from the system.
-Will not that be something system.

59:06.203 --> 59:12.286
-Okay, where do we find one of those?
-I already have one.

59:16.411 --> 59:17.911
Look!

59:49.786 --> 59:55.161
I did not know it was so big.
There is a lot higher than I thought.

59:55.244 --> 59:58.869
Eiffel Tower! Unbelievable! Eiffel Tower!

01:00:23.744 --> 01:00:25.661
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:00:26.036 --> 01:00:29.578
-Has something happened?
-Where is your personality?

01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:34.869
I think he is at home.
Probably.

01:00:34.953 --> 01:00:38.161
-Really?
-Is something wrong?

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:40.994
-Where have you been?
-Everyone had coffee.

01:00:41.078 --> 01:00:47.494
-No, before.
Take-out, took a smoking break, perhaps?

01:00:47.578 --> 01:00:51.286
I have not been able to stop.
It's hard.

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:56.286
Your colleague said you seemed to have
problems with your personality today.

01:00:56.369 --> 01:01:03.328
Yes, I thought I had it.
But I had not.

01:01:03.453 --> 01:01:06.369
It is good. It is...

01:01:06.453 --> 01:01:10.911
I know that you do not
is completely honest, Stefan.

01:01:10.994 --> 01:01:15.161
It's best you follow up with me.
-Okay.

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:23.577
Do not worry about me, Zelda.
I get along.

01:01:33.536 --> 01:01:35.827
Where are we?

01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:39.786
I thought we were going up.

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:54.744
-Can we smoke here?
-Yes, you and I can smoke here.

01:01:56.161 --> 01:01:59.661
-Did you buy that bell?
-What?

01:01:59.744 --> 01:02:07.119
<i>You mentioned a Patek Philippe with 24
complications at the Christmas party last year.</i>

01:02:07.202 --> 01:02:10.036
I am wasting my time on you?

01:02:15.577 --> 01:02:17.994
He came here.

01:02:18.369 --> 01:02:24.786
So I decided that maybe I should
meet him and I did it.

01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:32.786
Just to say that he should
take the first train back to Stockholm.

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:36.036
Which I suppose he did.

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:43.536
It was a great idea.
Very wise.

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:47.619
Sometimes we take things
and things into their own hands.

01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:53.744
-Think outside the box, huh?
-Yes. That is my motto.

01:02:53.827 --> 01:02:56.952
It is best for the organization...

01:02:57.036 --> 01:03:00.869
I am always loyal
and thinking outside the box.

01:03:00.952 --> 01:03:04.536
I know that you do.

01:03:07.494 --> 01:03:12.286
ONLY
He has traveled with her....

01:03:12.369 --> 01:03:15.244
Well... Nina.

01:03:40.036 --> 01:03:42.827
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:47.494
They went into the Metro and...
I wonder where they should.

01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:50.369
-Who is he?
-Ralph Parker.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:55.952
He is head of security at Trexx
and lnvoice. What is it?

01:03:56.036 --> 01:04:00.494
I have not been
completely honest with you.

01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:06.327
I met him. The other one.

01:04:06.411 --> 01:04:09.577
I appreciate your honesty.

01:04:10.827 --> 01:04:13.994
He exposes us, if he speaks?

01:04:14.077 --> 01:04:17.661
Now, we are sure
he is not included.

01:04:17.744 --> 01:04:23.411
-You and Stephen are very similar.
-Yes, I know, but...

01:04:23.494 --> 01:04:27.952
If I give you his ID card
you can get into.

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:40.411
Listen carefully. Take the elevator to floor 1 6;
the Scandinavian Department.

01:04:41.535 --> 01:04:47.827
At Stephen's desk, in your backpack,
You will find a Hello Kitty doll.

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:51.910
As soon as you put it on the table
press the navel.

01:04:51.994 --> 01:04:56.577
Then go to one of the toilets.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:00.285
Go out, look around.
If it worked-

01:05:00.369 --> 01:05:04.869
-The entire system is deleted
and it is chaos there.

01:06:51.869 --> 01:06:56.660
<i>He sees what I see.
He hears my thoughts.</i>

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:12.035
Ladies and gentlemen...
Dangst meets all environmental requirements.

01:07:12.785 --> 01:07:16.452
The bottles are completely recyclable.

01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:21.660
And here we have the
which we call a think-tank.

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:37.119
As you can imagine are now many
entities outside the broadcast radius.

01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:43.952
But right now are the most
Europe's hottest reality show "Asylum".

01:07:44.577 --> 01:07:48.244
What is the status?
Can we get a picture of my wife?

01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:53.119
When she sees on TV, do you mean?
Yes, I got it.

01:07:53.494 --> 01:07:56.327
Maybe she can undress now.

01:08:06.369 --> 01:08:10.452
We were able to follow
our residents in their home

01:08:10.535 --> 01:08:16.118
-With cameras in TVs
since the late 1990's.

01:08:16.202 --> 01:08:23.202
We do everything we can to
not violate anyone's privacy.

01:08:25.285 --> 01:08:30.785
It was recently that we,
through this amazing shampoo-

01:08:30.868 --> 01:08:39.452
-Has been able to reach them in
Underground tanks with custom.

01:08:53.993 --> 01:08:57.243
That fucking bastard!
He has been muted.

01:09:00.577 --> 01:09:04.827
<i>-Was it my phone?
-No, it was the TV</i>

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.577
<i>He said he would come home.</i>

01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:15.243
<i>As your friend
makes me really sad to see-</i>

01:09:15.327 --> 01:09:19.702
<i>-How bad it is between you two.</i>

01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:25.743
<i>But after seven years, I can not
just, like, put an end to it.</i>

01:09:26.452 --> 01:09:29.868
<i>He's like a part of me.
As...</i>

01:09:30.493 --> 01:09:34.202
<i>... A natural part of me.</i>

01:09:37.827 --> 01:09:43.410
<i>"I know how excited you are.
"I thought it was just like you said.</i>

01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:48.868
<i>Huh? Did you
I was trying to seduce you?</i>

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.160
Fucking pigs!

01:09:50.243 --> 01:09:55.160
<i>Would it be so awful
if I tried to seduce you?</i>

01:09:55.243 --> 01:09:58.743
<i>-What? L You're kidding, right?
-Are you watching this?</i>

01:10:00.327 --> 01:10:03.285
Damn... Anna!

01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:14.493
It is very fascinating.
I'll show one of my favorites.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:20.910
Over here we have a partner whose
every night when he is asleep...

01:10:20.993 --> 01:10:27.327
... For about five minutes...
satisfy himself.

01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:31.493
It was weird.
Why are both of the screens?

01:10:31.577 --> 01:10:36.577
Mr. Bahn, I do not understand.
How will the image from your eyes?

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:42.118
Sorry, I can not go into
technical details, but...

01:10:42.202 --> 01:10:45.285
Mind if I borrow this?

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:53.535
This is a normal hair.
Do you see?

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.535
But for us
it may also be an antenna.

01:11:00.243 --> 01:11:04.618
Dangst contains
organic micro-chips

01:11:04.702 --> 01:11:10.410
, Which embeds itself so deeply
in our resident scalp-

01:11:10.493 --> 01:11:16.577
-It gives us full access
for their vision and hearing.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:23.368
And - hang on now...
every word that person thinks.

01:11:23.452 --> 01:11:29.160
-Jeez, it's just amazing.
Mr-Bahn, we are waiting for masturbation now?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.952
<i>-Anna?
-Watch now. What happened?</i>

01:11:33.035 --> 01:11:37.702
<i>-Where did the woman go?
-Come on out. Sorry.</i>

01:11:37.785 --> 01:11:42.326
<i>I would not have done it.
You are my friend. Anna!</i>

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:44.910
I have also tried it there.

01:11:44.993 --> 01:11:49.410
It can not be her boyfriend.
What is the status?

01:11:49.493 --> 01:11:51.785
-Is he outside the metro?
I do not know.

01:11:51.868 --> 01:11:54.743
<i>Nothing, nothing, nothing...</i>

01:11:56.826 --> 01:12:00.368
He repeats the word "nothing".

01:12:00.451 --> 01:12:04.201
There is a problem.
I do not understand what has happened.

01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:08.326
"I would go to technology support.
-Wait.

01:12:08.826 --> 01:12:13.535
Wait a minute. My God. It is you!

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:18.410
-Do me the fuck not!
-How dare you come here?

01:12:23.826 --> 01:12:26.910
Where's Ralph?
Why are you just there?

01:12:27.035 --> 01:12:32.410
I want to hit that person...
For five minutes ago!

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:16.743
Look at the screen.

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:35.660
Satan.

01:14:41.368 --> 01:14:43.785
Nina...

01:15:40.201 --> 01:15:43.826
I'm sitting in the second wagon.

01:16:12.826 --> 01:16:15.534
Have you heard anything?

01:16:15.618 --> 01:16:19.868
"He is gone.
-Are you sure? Have they found the body?

01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:23.784
It takes weeks
before all the bodies are identified.

01:16:23.868 --> 01:16:28.909
Stefan Ljungberg is wanted.
They certainly identifies him first.

01:16:28.993 --> 01:16:35.243
I was there, I saw it. It was
the first time I saw someone...

01:16:35.326 --> 01:16:38.868
It was so nice....

01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:45.951
-What is it?
-His tone.

01:17:04.993 --> 01:17:10.701
You should not be here.
I am against the principle of witnesses.

01:17:10.784 --> 01:17:15.326
So the equation now contains
four cells.

01:17:18.159 --> 01:17:23.701
<i>Now, it happens. I have always
thought I would die in his sleep.</i>

01:17:23.951 --> 01:17:27.534
<i>With closed eyes. Peaceful.</i>

01:17:41.284 --> 01:17:46.201
-If you are... I do not.
"He had lost its function.

01:17:49.326 --> 01:17:52.493
All right. But what about me?

01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:58.493
Yes, you do?

01:18:02.326 --> 01:18:06.159
Here is the station where you get off.

01:18:15.534 --> 01:18:18.201
Goodbye, Roger.

01:18:28.993 --> 01:18:35.326
<i>Is it me thinking now? It feels
so. Yes, actually, it feels so.</i>

01:18:38.659 --> 01:18:44.576
Listen. Look in my eyes.
Do not use the shampoo.

01:18:44.701 --> 01:18:51.034
"It's not good for you.
-You have nice eyes. I believe you.

01:19:22.534 --> 01:19:29.534
<i>... Explosion in Paris at midnight.
Anonymous police sources said...</i>

01:19:29.617 --> 01:19:32.742
<i>Heather has links
AuthenTec to the terrorist group.</i>

01:19:32.826 --> 01:19:38.159
<i>We do not know what connections than,
but we will keep you informed...</i>

01:19:38.242 --> 01:19:44.117
<i>Nina Swartzcrult, Dangsts face,
inherits the foundation, which owns Trexx.</i>

01:19:44.201 --> 01:19:46.534
<i>We receive this directly.</i>

01:19:46.617 --> 01:19:51.617
<i>Despair, grief, anger.
But also determination.</i>

01:19:51.701 --> 01:19:57.409
<i>I trust Trexx indicative
principles: mobility and transparency.</i>

01:20:23.201 --> 01:20:29.492
Have I lost you? Please,
say that I have not lost you.
