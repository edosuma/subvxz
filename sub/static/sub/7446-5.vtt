01:29.540 --> 01:31.860
That's the problem there.
You know it and I know it.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.820
Oh, Christ, a bit of wine with dinner.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.300
You're not walking out on us.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.900
Shit!

01:36.900 --> 01:38.180
Oh, Jesus, Maria.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.420
WOMAN: Got an invitation to be a D.
By who?

01:40.420 --> 01:41.900
Welcome to the Kings Cross
detectives, love.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.740
Bloody great to be here.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.220
You're out with me today, love.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.580
Can I see your ID, madam?
I don't think I've got any.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.020
I'll have to ask you to get inside
so I can do a full body search.

01:51.020 --> 01:52.780
Well, hello.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.140
I wouldn't mind grabbing my money
and getting out of here.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.620
Dave's got all the takings and he's...

01:56.620 --> 01:57.620
What?

01:57.620 --> 01:59.860
I can give you 100 bucks each
out of my own pocket.

01:59.860 --> 02:01.020
The deal was 750.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.260
This is Shaka.
Got into a bit of shit in Leb.

02:03.260 --> 02:05.100
ARGGH!

02:05.100 --> 02:06.380
So I give him a job.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.220
You not work in the Cross no more.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.780
You stick this in your arse!
BILL: All this fighting, Louis.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.260
Now we got bad feelings.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.980
Hey, I didn't do this, John.
I just run a business.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.938
You start wars, finish 'em yourself, mate.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.215
SONG: # It's a jungle out there

02:33.380 --> 02:35.177
# It's a jungle out there

02:53.820 --> 02:55.617
# It's a jungle out there. #

03:03.120 --> 03:05.240
NARRATOR: Every Friday at 11 o'clock,

03:05.240 --> 03:09.360
Louis Bayeh would go to Kings Cross,
collect his standover money

03:09.360 --> 03:11.874
and sit down to lunch
at his favourite restaurant.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.960
Louis always parked his car
right out front in a 'No Standing' zone,

03:16.960 --> 03:18.520
but he never got booked.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.752
He always got the best table
in the house, but he'd never pay a cent.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.160
He was a man who expected respect

03:27.160 --> 03:30.596
and for a long time,
that's exactly what he got.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.640
But all good things must come to an end,

03:34.640 --> 03:38.560
and for Louis, the end came
in the form of Benny Kassab's boys,

03:38.560 --> 03:40.520
Norm Korbage and Shaka...

03:40.520 --> 03:44.035
young guns with no respect
for age or reputation.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.080
REPORTER: Police say
that Bayeh's Ermington home

03:48.080 --> 03:49.920
was sprayed with automatic rifle fire,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.720
probably from a moving vehicle.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.320
Given that Bayeh's wife and children
were home at the time,

03:55.320 --> 03:59.360
it was described as a minor miracle
that no-one was hurt.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.040
BAYEH: Anybody got a problem with me,
they know what I look like.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.640
Why don't they come
have problem with me?

04:03.640 --> 04:05.920
They come to shoot my family,
my children? This my house!

04:05.920 --> 04:09.320
When asked whether he would
be seeking police protection,

04:09.320 --> 04:12.200
Mr Bayeh said, "I don't trust them.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.919
"Police are the main problem here."
Oh, shit!

04:22.160 --> 04:24.151
I made you some breakfast.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.433
Thanks.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
I have to go to work now.
I'm... kind of late.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.756
I'll just leave this here.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.760
LENNIE: Now back in the old days,

04:49.760 --> 04:52.280
whenever there was
bad blood down here,

04:52.280 --> 04:56.440
George'd sit everybody down
and they could talk it out.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.520
TALK it out.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.200
Ben, I thought you might like to kick off.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.520
Like you said, I come here
to smooth things over.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.520
Hey, Louis, I swear on my mother, man,

05:07.520 --> 05:10.478
I had nothing to do with
your house getting shot up.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.160
These are for your wife.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.516
And, uh, this is for you.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.920
And your mates, Shaka and Norm,
they gonna send flower too?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.520
I dunno where they're at, Louis.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.880
You tell them
to shoot my house, they shoot.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.760
You tell them to come here,
they no come?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.000
Hey, I never told them to shoot.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.480
That's garbage. Bullshit.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.240
Hey, I'm not bullshitting, man.
Bullshit!

05:39.240 --> 05:41.840
Fucking bullshit, mate!
Hey!

05:41.840 --> 05:43.960
Come on, Louis.
Just calm it down, hey?

05:43.960 --> 05:46.080
Lennie, I come here for you
because you ask me.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.240
I no come here for insult.
Insult? What insult?

05:49.240 --> 05:51.160
I gave you money, mate.
What do you want?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.920
Fuck your money! I want payback.
Hey, Louis.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.360
Tell me where they are
or I make you pay.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.112
You choose, Kassab.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.633
That went well, huh?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.513
How'd you go?

06:18.280 --> 06:19.760
Fuck!

06:19.760 --> 06:21.240
Screw the prick, man.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.320
Benny, this is getting out of hand.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.360
Oh, what, you think I like it?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.920
Hey, I can't walk down the Strip now.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.400
I gotta carry a piece

06:29.400 --> 06:31.760
'cause Louis's monkeys,
they're looking to smash my head.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.840
Yeah?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.600
You know the fucking rules, OK?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.200
No shooting.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.480
Oh, yeah? And if he comes at me,
what do I do, huh?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.840
Let him blow my brains out?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.273
Hmm.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.960
Sean Sinclair.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.000
And, of course, you remember
Chook Fowler, our fearless leader.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.160
Hi.
Jesus.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.000
When you said
you were bringing in new talent,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.680
I didn't think you meant this kind.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.840
Debbie Webb, if I could introduce you

06:56.840 --> 06:58.320
to Detective Constable
Claudia Campanelli,

06:58.320 --> 06:59.920
just over from North Sydney.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.400
I thought you two ladies could...

07:01.400 --> 07:04.597
Ladies, if you could get us a pot of tea,
I'll have it in me office.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.040
Lucky you're here.
We needed a new tea lady.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.998
That's Detective Constable Tea Lady.
(CHUCKLES)

07:12.040 --> 07:14.800
So what can I expect over here?
A bit of a jungle, hey?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.280
(CHUCKLES) You're not wrong.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.200
Chook's OK. I mean,
he'll have a perve, but he won't touch.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.080
Eddie's inclined to flop his
old fella out after a few drinks.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.320
Uh, Scully, he's a teddy bear...
no real harm there.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.320
OK. I meant what can I expect
on the streets?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.440
Oh, right. I forgot about the street.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.560
North Sydney was pretty sleepy.
Mostly domestics and shoplifts.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.440
But the Cross,
this is the sharp end of the job.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.520
Yeah.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.000
Well, Benny Kassab, we could, uh...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.920
...we could load him up, send him off.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.920
It was a lot smoother
when it was just the Bayehs.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.040
Bloody Louis Bayeh's the problem.
We should load him up.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.360
No! No, no.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.760
A, it won't shut him up.
B, Louis's got mates.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.000
Now, they might be getting old,
but they still got teeth.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.160
But, Chook, we give in
to an ape like Bayeh,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.640
what message does it send?

08:01.640 --> 08:04.791
How are we gonna walk down the street
with our heads up?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.720
OK, look. I don't give a shit what you do.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.920
You just make sure
that this doesn't blow up

08:11.920 --> 08:14.559
or else we are all covered in it.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.713
My fucking temper.
My temper always make problem for me.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.960
What if Shaka and Norm apologised?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.440
What, so they shoot my house,

08:26.440 --> 08:28.280
they fucking say sorry,
everything alright?

08:28.280 --> 08:31.280
No. Fair enough.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.919
You need a result.

08:32.919 --> 08:36.754
I gotta look strong here.
I can't fucking lose respect.

08:37.919 --> 08:43.960
If they got pinched,
went away for a year, or 10,

08:43.960 --> 08:46.713
your problems would be solved.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.960
Louis wants peace with Benny Kassab.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.920
But he's got a condition.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.520
Shaka and Norm... they gotta do time.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.760
The drive-by's not my brief.
Parramatta's got it.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.040
And they don't know where Shaka
and Norm are at. Only Benny does.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.240
You find out where they are from Benny,

09:12.240 --> 09:15.560
I tell Louis's cops in Parramatta
and then we got peace.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.520
I'll see what I can do.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.400
I had a little word with Trevor

09:19.400 --> 09:22.360
and he reckons Norm and Shaka
have gotta hand themselves in.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.840
No. No way.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.480
Louis Bayeh's coppers get 'em,
they're gonna be rooted.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.160
Who said anything about
Louis Bayeh's coppers, hey?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.360
The boys come in,
me and Trev will charge 'em,

09:31.360 --> 09:32.840
give 'em a slap on the wrist...

09:32.840 --> 09:36.440
done and dusted before the Parramatta
boys even get a whiff, alright?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.280
Louis Bayeh saves face

09:38.280 --> 09:40.280
and you, you get back to business

09:40.280 --> 09:43.080
and the people of New South Wales
are well and truly served.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.360
No. Norm won't do time.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.480
Benny, you're not listening, are ya?

09:48.480 --> 09:51.440
I just said a "slap on the wrist".

09:51.440 --> 09:53.908
And we'll give him bail on the spot.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.800
DAVE: Jesus, you look hot.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.600
Yeah, well, have a good look
'cause you're not touching.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.120
Kimmy...
I'm at work. Piss off.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.040
I promised my friends 750 each
for that strip show of yours.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.640
And what do you do?
You piss off without paying a cent.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.029
I'm sorry about that, really.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.520
I bought a part in a florist.
It's been a bloody nightmare.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.800
A florist? And how is this my problem?

10:20.800 --> 10:23.480
I ended up spending
some of the money from the show

10:23.480 --> 10:25.560
to cover my bills.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.440
I thought maybe
you'd help me organise another show.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.680
Gale and Mel are still pissed off
about the first one.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.640
Who cares about them?
You were the star, Kim.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.518
Jesus, every cop in Sydney's
talking about you.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.360
I reckon you were born to strip.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.158
I could... help you get set up.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.551
What do you say?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.918
(MOANING AND GRUNTING)

10:58.760 --> 11:00.240
Hey.
Yeah.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.195
Cuff me.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.679
Are... you sure?
Yeah.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.280
That's hot.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.157
Is it?
Mm-hm.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.959
Hurt me.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.080
I don't wanna do that.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.196
I want you to.
No.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.751
Here.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.236
God, I'm sorry.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.120
Just a lot of men like that.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.040
I don't.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.237
That's not how I see you.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.868
I could marry a woman like you, Kim.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.600
When we get in there,
we tell Trevor we were off our heads.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.160
We were coked off our eyeballs, man.
We didn't think about Louis's kids.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.920
Hey, it's cool, man.
You can tell him yourself.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.880
(HORN BLARES)

12:30.880 --> 12:33.240
Where are we going, Benny?
What this place?

12:33.240 --> 12:36.400
This is the cop shop, man!
Oh, you bullshit me!

12:36.400 --> 12:38.040
This is where we're meeting them.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.160
It's bullshit!
I'm not bullshitting you, alright?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.520
Bayeh's got half the cops in Sydney
in his back pocket.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.280
We go in there, they'll find us dead
in a fucking cell!

12:45.280 --> 12:48.400
Hey, Bayeh and his boys,
they're in Parramatta.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.600
This is Bankstown, bro. It's neutral.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.800
You said a meeting, man.
You said a meeting!

12:52.800 --> 12:55.720
Hey, youse come in here now,
Trevor's gonna look after you boys,

12:55.720 --> 12:57.200
I'm telling ya.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.000
Trevor Haken? And Trevor Haken
doesn't take money off the Bayehs?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.480
Man, he's the first in line!

13:01.480 --> 13:05.440
I swear to God, Norm.
Norm, I give you my oath.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.240
You cop a little charge now,

13:07.240 --> 13:11.240
you get bail,
you'll be home for dinner, huh?

13:11.240 --> 13:15.438
Hey, you know I got your back, yeah?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.840
TREVOR: Alright, we'll do it upstairs.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.480
I'm gonna go grab a couple of coffees,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.720
you boys have a chat,
I'll come back in 10.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.359
Come up with a credible explanation
that puts you in the clear.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.680
It's not on. It's just for practice.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.800
So, tell me the version
where you're not the shooter, hmm?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.313
Huh?

13:39.520 --> 13:43.520
Well, on that night,
youse were coked off your heads, right?

13:43.520 --> 13:46.400
OK, but let's just call it booze.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.040
It'll play better if it gets to court.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.240
Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:49.240 --> 13:53.400
So youse were that pissed, mate,
youse didn't know what was going on,

13:53.400 --> 13:55.120
either of you.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.669
OK, so who pulled the trigger?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.120
Some guy called Joe.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.951
I had never seen him before.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.040
Some guy called Joe.
I'd never seen him before.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.720
I'd never seen him before.
I'd fallen asleep by then.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.040
Some guy called Joe.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.560
He gave us some choof, smoking gear,
really knocked us around.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.880
So Joey asks me, "Can I drive?"
I say, "No worries."

14:29.880 --> 14:31.800
Joey says to me,
"Let me drive your car."

14:31.800 --> 14:33.320
'Cause I'm off my head, right?

14:33.320 --> 14:35.480
'Cause I am off my head, yeah?

14:35.480 --> 14:37.760
TREVOR: And where did he drive you?

14:37.760 --> 14:41.080
You see, I'd fallen asleep in the back.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.240
I'm in the back of the car.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.120
And all of a sudden... all of a sudden...

14:46.120 --> 14:49.920
bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang!

14:49.920 --> 14:52.354
The guy's shooting out the window!

14:53.400 --> 14:55.640
How was I supposed to know
he was gonna start shooting?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.835
I just wanted to go out
and get some honeys.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.800
(BANGING ON DOOR)

15:05.800 --> 15:07.920
Oh, shit.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.435
3:46pm. I am suspending this interview
for a toilet break.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.480
You're a cheeky little prick, Haken.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.840
Get back over there. Now!

15:16.840 --> 15:19.680
They're mine!
That drive-by happened on my patch.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.160
Wiley, I wish I could help,

15:21.160 --> 15:23.560
but I'm already three-quarters done
taking their statements.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.440
Really? On what charge?

15:25.440 --> 15:28.320
I'd say firearms related.
Bullshit!

15:28.320 --> 15:30.160
It was attempt murder.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.400
Norman Korbage says
the shots were fired by a third party.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.680
Now, unless you've got something
that shows different,

15:34.680 --> 15:36.280
there's no way
attempt murder's gonna fly.

15:36.280 --> 15:40.760
Fine, but if these little pricks
just walk out of here,

15:40.760 --> 15:42.990
then my credibility is shot, Trevor.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.400
BENNY: You said they'd get bail.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.600
JIM: Well, bail's been opposed.
Yeah, by who?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.080
By us, the police.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.760
I gave them my word, mate.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.200
Well, that was before Louis's mates
came down from Parramatta

15:55.200 --> 15:56.680
and made us all look stupid.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.440
Yeah, you gave me your word!
Hey!

15:58.440 --> 16:03.280
Mate, I did my best, OK?
So just have a little bit of gratitude.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.800
Otherwise, things could get
a lot worse for all concerned.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.920
Understand? Come on.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.640
NARRATOR: The Kings Cross
detectives' interest in the case

16:10.640 --> 16:12.440
was purely financial.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.920
They wanted to keep two good earners
out on the street.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.560
But for Benny Kassab,

16:17.560 --> 16:20.320
it was all about honouring
a promise to his mates...

16:20.320 --> 16:23.800
men who took broken promises
very seriously.

16:23.800 --> 16:28.640
SONG: # Well, just because
you think I'm a good old egg

16:28.640 --> 16:31.800
# Don't catch chickens
before they hatch

16:31.800 --> 16:36.480
# Now, if you've got the mind
You're going to two-time me

16:36.480 --> 16:39.520
# Baby, you've met your match

16:39.520 --> 16:44.600
# If you think you can two-time me
one more time

16:44.600 --> 16:47.353
# Don't count your chickens
before they hatch

16:55.880 --> 17:00.317
# Don't count your chickens
before they hatch. #

17:12.220 --> 17:14.700
Larkins has got a new partner.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.980
Apparently he drives like Greg Norman.

17:16.980 --> 17:20.060
I hope you didn't invite me along
just for my drive, Minister.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.500
(LAUGHS) Of course not.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.700
Putting's important too.
(LAUGHS)

17:24.700 --> 17:26.180
NARRATOR: Dennis Kelly thought golf

17:26.180 --> 17:29.460
was the most boring way
to spend an afternoon ever invented,

17:29.460 --> 17:30.940
but he loved politics,

17:30.940 --> 17:33.620
and no-one played that game
better than Dennis.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.260
WALLIS: Dennis Kelly.
Justice Larkins, it's an honour.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.100
Ken, Dennis, meet Sid Hillier.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.772
G'day, Dennis. Been a while.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.300
NARRATOR: Dennis and Sid
graduated the academy the same year.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.020
They hated each other then
and nothing had changed.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.136
Yeah, can't seem to get away
from each other.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.137
Your vehicle's in a 'No Standing' zone.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.060
I always park there.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.540
Well, now I need to park there

18:10.540 --> 18:14.374
so you move it or you're gone
for obstructing police.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.020
Monica, move my car.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.820
You stay where you are.
You're moving that car yourself.

18:20.820 --> 18:23.460
Now.
I'm eating.

18:23.460 --> 18:26.740
You don't move it, you'll be in
the fucking lockup eating slops,

18:26.740 --> 18:28.571
which I will personally piss in.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.057
Too much chilli!

18:43.860 --> 18:45.373
Oh, shot, Dennis.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.340
LARKINS: That's the one.
Hey?

18:48.340 --> 18:52.780
So, Detective, what do you make
of this mess in the news?

18:52.780 --> 18:54.460
The Bayeh drive-by?

18:54.460 --> 18:59.060
Not much. A bunch of low-level idiots
squabbling over drug money.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.700
I know someone on this case...
Malcolm Bigg.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.820
He tells me
a couple of fellas up the Cross

19:03.820 --> 19:07.020
are interfering in the investigation.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.020
Haken and...

19:09.020 --> 19:11.853
Egan. Jim Egan.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.777
They're both friends of yours,
aren't they, Den?

19:15.820 --> 19:17.620
Egan and I go way back.

19:17.620 --> 19:21.420
Haken... when he made Detective,
he was under me.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.140
So you'd vouch for these two men?

19:23.140 --> 19:26.100
In my opinion,
they're both talented investigators.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.620
I hope so.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.260
I've got this Hatton bastard

19:29.260 --> 19:32.140
banging on about
a royal commission into policing.

19:32.140 --> 19:35.098
Last thing the government wants
is to give him ammunition.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.573
Oh, shit.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.860
NARRATOR: When Eddie Gould
asked Debbie Webb

19:40.860 --> 19:42.900
to investigate a break and enter with him,

19:42.900 --> 19:44.700
she wasn't suspicious.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.740
At first, she'd hoped
it was a rare opportunity

19:47.740 --> 19:50.174
to be involved
in some actual police work.

19:51.980 --> 19:53.620
Even when it didn't work out that way,

19:53.620 --> 19:57.380
she assumed Eddie had dragged
her along to shirk on his paperwork.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.660
Here you go, Deb. I got all the details.

19:59.660 --> 20:02.100
You can finish it off
when we get back to the station.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.980
I haven't even seen the point of entry yet.

20:03.980 --> 20:05.460
I've seen it. Now come on.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.416
Wanna get back to the Bourbon
while they're still frosty.

20:08.460 --> 20:09.780
Giddy-up.

20:09.780 --> 20:12.420
But that seemingly run-of-the-mill
break and enter report

20:12.420 --> 20:14.380
would start a chain of events

20:14.380 --> 20:16.740
that would change
not only Debbie Webb

20:16.740 --> 20:21.450
but the whole of the New South Wales
Police Force forever.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.420
DENNIS: Chookie!

20:25.420 --> 20:27.420
Chief Inspector Kelly
at my bloody drinks, hey?

20:27.420 --> 20:30.140
Here we go. Here we go.

20:30.140 --> 20:33.660
Come on, ya poofter!
Your mate just got a bloody promotion!

20:33.660 --> 20:36.260
Chief Inspector's here.
Yeah, Trev's off the booze.

Right up there with the virgin birth.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.700
Sergeant fucking Scullion.
Gives us all hope, eh?

20:44.700 --> 20:47.260
Yeah, true. If Scully can make sergeant,
even Eddie's got a shot.

20:47.260 --> 20:49.057
Hear you went out on a job with him.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.180
Break and enter.
Dragged me out to Rooty Hill.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.380
tall, big house
with a double arched garage?

20:57.380 --> 20:59.260
Yeah, that's right.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.220
That's Eddie's brother.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.820
He had a different surname.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.540
Changed it, didn't he?

21:04.540 --> 21:07.460
Bit of history on him,
not entirely glorious.

21:07.460 --> 21:13.100
So you're saying I've put my name
on an insurance scam?

21:13.100 --> 21:16.980
Let me guess... Eddie filled in
the particulars, but got you to sign it?

21:16.980 --> 21:18.572
There's your answer.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.140
See if the poolroom upstairs is open, eh?

21:24.140 --> 21:25.255
Fuck.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.531
Here, let me get you another drink.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.656
DENNIS: I been watching
Louis Bayeh on the news.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.339
Seems you blokes are running a bit hot.

Come on. Egan's got as much drive
as a wet toilet roll.

21:46.580 --> 21:48.252
You're running things down here.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.820
So what's the score?

21:52.820 --> 21:55.500
There's gotta be more
than a drink in this.

21:55.500 --> 21:59.380
Ben's got a few young guns,
itchy nutters.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.860
If I step out now and let him sink...

22:01.860 --> 22:05.020

Mmm.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.140
Now Louis's put Parramatta onto us.

22:08.140 --> 22:10.529
This isn't coming from Louis.

the whole station's got tickets.

26:50.820 --> 26:53.740
Aside from Joe. His mum'd kill him.
Piss off.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.220
Seriously, the way they're selling,

26:55.220 --> 26:58.100
I reckon Joanne'll be flying first-class.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.140
Joanne?
Dave's wife.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.370
Isn't that what the second one's for?
To pay her way?

27:06.780 --> 27:09.100
Though why he'd want the missus along
on a footy trip

27:09.100 --> 27:10.900
is a bloody mystery to me.

27:10.900 --> 27:12.380
Oh, that's fucking crazy.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.460
Um... yeah, thank you.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.820
Hey, you sure you don't want
to leave him a note?

27:16.820 --> 27:21.211
No, that's fine. Just tell him
I popped around for a chat, OK?

27:31.740 --> 27:34.340
NARRATOR: With Norm and Shaka
still in custody,

27:34.340 --> 27:36.100
Benny Kassab was seriously exposed.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.260
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

27:37.260 --> 27:40.860
Louis Bayeh could command a virtual
army of thugs and standover men

27:40.860 --> 27:44.694
while Benny just didn't have the pull
to get his own army together.

27:45.740 --> 27:49.289
So instead he recruited a one-man army.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.620
Benny had come a long way in a hurry,

27:58.620 --> 28:02.300
from humble doorman to a major player
in a matter of months.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.900
He thought he could have it all...

28:03.900 --> 28:07.220
millions in the bank, pretty girl
on his arm, respect on the street.

28:07.220 --> 28:09.460
And he wanted the heavyweight title
that went with it...

28:09.460 --> 28:11.337
King of the Cross.

28:12.380 --> 28:13.940
BENNY: Hey, beautiful! Hey, hey.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.540
Why don't you stop for a minute? Huh?

28:15.540 --> 28:17.860
Oh, shit. Let me buy you a drink.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.454
How about lunch? No? Dinner?

28:21.500 --> 28:22.980
How about a sports car?

28:22.980 --> 28:26.420
I don't need a sports car.
No, but you'd look great in one.

28:26.420 --> 28:29.340
Hey, if you change your mind,
I'll be right here...

28:29.340 --> 28:30.820
the Budget.

28:30.820 --> 28:32.856
Yo, it's my place, baby!

28:33.900 --> 28:35.970
Hey! Hey, Louis!

28:42.740 --> 28:46.176
(ANIMAL SNARLING)

28:50.900 --> 28:52.333
(ANIMAL SNARLING)

29:09.140 --> 29:12.735
Hey, any time, Louis. Just pop by, mate!

29:22.260 --> 29:24.012
You really think he'll call straightaway?

29:25.500 --> 29:28.100
Yeah, well, they said
the slimy prick starts at 6:00

29:28.100 --> 29:30.460
and it's five past now, so I...

29:30.460 --> 29:31.940
(PHONE RINGS)

29:31.940 --> 29:33.931
There we go.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.100
Hello.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.940
I just got told you popped in,
looking for me.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.780
Sorry, I didn't mean
to get you into trouble.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.300
It's just that we need to finalise
the plans for the show

29:43.300 --> 29:44.820
and you didn't call me, so...

29:44.820 --> 29:47.460
If it's anything like the last one,
I'm sure it'll be fine.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.380
Actually, it's... it's a little bit different
from the last one.

29:50.380 --> 29:53.060
See, some of the girls that are doing it,

29:53.060 --> 29:55.940
um, they're actually
really into each other.

29:55.940 --> 29:58.460
'Into'?

29:58.460 --> 29:59.940
As in...

29:59.940 --> 30:02.980
As in when they do the lezzo stuff,
they're not acting.

30:02.980 --> 30:05.060
I mean, they really go for it.

30:05.060 --> 30:08.460
So it's gonna be, like,
one big all-girl orgy on the stage.

30:08.460 --> 30:10.098
Is that OK?

30:11.700 --> 30:14.260
Christ, I should have
increased the door price.

30:14.260 --> 30:17.100
Yeah, and because, um...
because there's six girls,

30:17.100 --> 30:20.540
it's gonna be a lot longer, so I think
you should buy some more booze.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.620
Bloody oath! (CHUCKLES)

30:22.620 --> 30:26.260
Jeez, watching those lesbians
must be thirsty work, eh?

30:26.260 --> 30:27.739
'Bye!

30:30.100 --> 30:32.614
(GROANS)

30:41.540 --> 30:43.700
NARRATOR: Dennis Kelly
wasn't a religious man,

30:43.700 --> 30:45.620
but he did have principles.

30:45.620 --> 30:48.100
His second rule
was 'L ook after your mates'.

30:48.100 --> 30:52.020
His first rule... 'L ook after number one'.

30:52.020 --> 30:54.500
MAN: Dennis, good to see you, mate.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.100
So what can I do for you?

30:56.100 --> 30:58.460
Uh, the Louis Bayeh drive-by.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.140
There's been rumours
that the investigation

31:00.140 --> 31:03.180
wasn't entirely, uh, kosher.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.060
And you wondered
whether IA were getting involved?

31:05.060 --> 31:07.500
(CHUCKLES) Are you?

31:07.500 --> 31:09.140
Mate, if I talk to you about this,

31:09.140 --> 31:11.420
I'm putting my arse on the line
for a good kicking.

31:11.420 --> 31:13.138
Mmm.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.457
Does the name Benny Kassab
mean anything to you?

31:20.780 --> 31:23.980
He's a criminal associate of the shooters
in the drive-by.

31:23.980 --> 31:27.416
What if I gave you information about
his relationship with Trevor Haken?

31:28.860 --> 31:31.060
If you're assisting with the inquiry,

31:31.060 --> 31:34.140
then obviously it would be necessary
to discuss the details of the case.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.654
Well, you have my full cooperation.

31:37.860 --> 31:41.380
There's an allegation that charges
in relation to the Bayeh drive-by

31:41.380 --> 31:42.940
were improperly downgraded.

31:42.940 --> 31:43.940
Hmm.

31:43.940 --> 31:45.700
Jim Egan and Trevor Haken
were mentioned.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.780
Someone pushed it along upstairs?

31:47.780 --> 31:49.975
Pushed it to the top of our list.

31:53.100 --> 31:57.412
What can you tell me about
Trevor Haken and this Benny Kassab?

31:58.620 --> 32:01.578
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

32:17.260 --> 32:19.980
I've just told IA about your connection
to Benny Kassab.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.460
What?

32:21.460 --> 32:24.300
They're gonna pick him up.
They'll be looking for him to shop ya.

32:24.300 --> 32:27.420
Shit, Dennis. You've fucked me!

32:27.420 --> 32:30.620
I needed information, Trevor.
The best way to get it is to give it.

32:30.620 --> 32:32.860
And what good'll that do me
when I'm facing charges, huh?

32:32.860 --> 32:34.620
IA, mate, were already all over this.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.420
They'd have found out
about you and Kassab soon enough.

32:37.420 --> 32:41.652
The smart move now
is to admit the association.

32:46.780 --> 32:49.220
So I'm going to register you
as a police informant.

32:49.220 --> 32:50.780
That just means that if anyone asks...

32:50.780 --> 32:53.135
Informant? Nah, I'm no dog.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.060
Look, it's just a form

32:56.060 --> 32:58.300
so we can explain to Internal Affairs

32:58.300 --> 33:00.620
why you, me and Egan
have had so much contact.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.900
Egan keeps telling me
he's gonna fix things for my boys.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.660
Nothing happens, mate, hey?

33:05.660 --> 33:08.620
I mean, I'm starting to think
he's taking Louis's side.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.780
Alright, so from now on,
you deal with me direct

33:11.780 --> 33:15.455
and I'll fix things up
for Shaka and Korbage, alright?

33:18.620 --> 33:21.140
Well, I am gonna need some cash
to get that started.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.220
Five thousand will do it.

33:23.220 --> 33:25.580
I already gave Jimmy five grand.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.620
Well, I don't know anything about that.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.692
But if you want this sorted,
I'm gonna need some money.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.540
NARRATOR: Trevor Haken's hand
was always out,

33:38.540 --> 33:40.860
but it wasn't just because he was greedy.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.420
Perhaps no-one had ever told him
you can't buy friends,

33:43.420 --> 33:45.217
because he never stopped trying.

33:46.380 --> 33:49.178
Sometimes it very nearly worked.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.529
And sometimes it didn't.

33:58.300 --> 33:59.780
Don't know if you've heard,

33:59.780 --> 34:02.100
but there's been some progress
with this Louis Bayeh affair.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.460
Is that right?
Mmm.

34:04.460 --> 34:09.540
It seems that your friend Haken
had been cultivating an informant

34:09.540 --> 34:11.980
who happened to be
an associate of the shooters.

34:11.980 --> 34:14.900
Oh, so that's why
he got involved in the case.

34:14.900 --> 34:18.260
Mmm. All totally aboveboard.
Mmm.

34:18.260 --> 34:21.300
I also heard that the IA investigation

34:21.300 --> 34:25.940
benefited greatly from assistance given
by a certain chief inspector.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.580
Well, I passed on information
that happened to fall into my lap.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.100
Just doing my duty.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.980
It was mentioned in the cabinet,

34:33.980 --> 34:37.210
as was the name of the friendly officer.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.060
So, are you ready to play some golf?

34:41.060 --> 34:43.540
Sure are, Justice. G'day, Sidney.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.340
NARRATOR: Once again, Dennis had
turned adversity into advantage

34:46.340 --> 34:48.179
and wriggled out of a tight spot.

34:48.179 --> 34:51.809
And Sid Hillier for one couldn't
figure out how the hell he'd done it.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.980
For me, Benny, a song is like a marriage

35:00.980 --> 35:04.220
between the lyrics and the melody.

35:04.220 --> 35:10.540
This rap shit, OK,
the lyrics can be like poetry,

35:10.540 --> 35:13.900
but without the melody, it's cold.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.500
Mate, come in!
We got some beautiful girls!

35:15.500 --> 35:20.290
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
Here come 'P lanet of the Apes'.

35:21.940 --> 35:25.820
Danny, Danny! Let's go!
Hey, what are you doing?

35:25.820 --> 35:28.620
Stand back. Arggh!
Don't, boys.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.100
Huh? Huh?!

(ANIMAL SNARLING)

35:35.900 --> 35:37.060

We want lezzos!

36:23.900 --> 36:27.460
We want lezzos! We want lezzos!

36:27.460 --> 36:28.980
(YELLING AND CHANTING)

36:28.980 --> 36:31.340
What's happening?!
I don't know. She told me 7 o'clock.

36:31.340 --> 36:33.540
Well, hurry up. They're... Get back there!

36:33.540 --> 36:35.940
They're getting rowdy.
Bring the lezzos!

36:35.940 --> 36:38.818
Where the fuck is she?! Dammit!

36:42.940 --> 36:44.420
Hi.
Hi.

36:44.420 --> 36:47.980
I was just wondering if the wife
of a police officer worked here?

36:47.980 --> 36:51.220
Yeah. She's, like, the owner.
She's out the back right now, but...

36:51.220 --> 36:52.700
Um, where?

36:52.700 --> 36:54.940
I've got something really important
to tell her about her husband.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.817
There she is.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.180
She's pregnant.

37:03.180 --> 37:07.140
Yeah, cool, huh? It'll be their first.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.780
Do you want me to call her out here?

37:08.780 --> 37:09.780
No.
Joanne!

37:09.780 --> 37:12.300
Sorry, do you work
with her husband, or...

37:12.300 --> 37:16.380
Hey. Hey, what happened?
Did you tell her?

37:16.380 --> 37:19.611
She can have the prick.
I'd rather be a hooker.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.440
When I queried him,
Detective Senior Constable Gould

37:32.440 --> 37:35.880
directed me to simply fill out
the complaint form and sign it,

37:35.880 --> 37:37.640
which I did.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.160
And only later on you realised
that the complainant was his brother?

37:40.160 --> 37:42.360
Yeah, that's correct.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.240
Detective Constable
Sean Sinclair told me

37:45.240 --> 37:47.231
and I subsequently
confirmed it myself.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.760
You waited some time

37:49.760 --> 37:52.433
before bringing this matter
to Internal Affairs.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.515
These guys, they're, um,
capable of anything.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.440
It's hard not to be intimidated.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.237
What do you mean,
"They're capable of anything"?

38:07.680 --> 38:09.160
I withdraw that statement, sir.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.957
I should have reported it earlier.
You're right.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
There wouldn't be anything personal
going on here, would there?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.920
A grudge against Detective Gould or...

38:16.920 --> 38:18.640
I'm telling you Eddie Gould's corrupt.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.280
Isn't that enough?

38:20.280 --> 38:21.760
Well, no.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.240
Police officers also have the right
to be presumed innocent

38:24.240 --> 38:26.120
and an unsubstantiated
accusation like this,

38:26.120 --> 38:27.600
I mean, it's hardly going to...

38:27.600 --> 38:29.320
You can substantiate this.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.440
I mean, the dodgy
break and enter report,

38:31.440 --> 38:34.200
it's... it's filed in our office.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.480
Well, certainly if you can
retrieve a copy of this report

38:37.480 --> 38:39.760
and bring it in to us...

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
I mean, that would be a different story.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.910
Do you think you could do that?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.600
Looking for your report, Deb?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.556
Your break and enter report?

39:20.600 --> 39:22.795
Would you like me to help you find it?

39:28.040 --> 39:30.720
You going somewhere?
Let me past.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.560
What you did was bloomin' stupid.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.560
Even for a dumb bitch like you.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.440
Let me past.
(LAUGHS)

39:38.440 --> 39:41.796
What do you think you're gonna do, hey?

39:42.840 --> 39:45.229
Hey?
Let me past.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.280
Hello. Internal Affairs.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.240
I've just been into work. They all knew.
They knew I'd spoken to you.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.720
Wait. Who is this?
It's Debbie Webb.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.360
I went in to get the B&E file
and they knew I'd spoken to you.

40:11.360 --> 40:13.840
That's not possible.
It's fucking possible, alright?

40:13.840 --> 40:16.280
Now, you do something,
otherwise I'm gonna end up dead.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.560
Yeah, alright.
Go straight home and stay there.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.400
In the morning,
report to the Commissioner's Policy Unit

40:20.400 --> 40:21.880
at Police Headquarters.

is the right thing to do?" he'd say.

MAN ON P. A: The NSW Police
is an army 16,000 strong.

01:07:52.058 --> 01:07:55.138
14,000 of us are sworn officers

01:07:55.138 --> 01:07:59.818

we have sworn to uphold God's law.

These days, it's fashionable
in some quarters

01:08:18.618 --> 01:08:20.978
to accuse the police
of every crime in the book.

01:08:20.978 --> 01:08:22.578
Why?

01:08:22.578 --> 01:08:26.298
Because we're a big,
slow-moving target.

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:30.497

01:17:54.118 --> 01:17:57.758
he might be doing business
with the Five T gang in Cabramatta.

Of course.

Don't buy it for a second.

The Prime Minister wears Zegna suits.

Did you find any discrepancies
in his tax records? Sid's, I mean.

and barrel, for a single dollar.
