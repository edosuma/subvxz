03:42.587 --> 03:43.422
Come in.

03:47.493 --> 03:50.395
He's, uh, asking for you.

03:53.999 --> 03:56.966
How do I look?

03:56.968 --> 03:57.968
You look beautiful,

03:57.970 --> 03:59.001
Miss Julie.

03:59.003 --> 04:01.171
You always do.

04:01.173 --> 04:03.839
I hate these dinner parties.

04:03.841 --> 04:05.541
Don't be fibbing.

04:05.543 --> 04:10.449
You love these parties.
You hate Annabelle Tilby.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.527
Hm.

04:24.862 --> 04:26.898
I'm sure she'll be down soon.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.001
Yes.

04:32.571 --> 04:34.039
Uncle Kyle.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.210
It's about time you got here.

04:40.212 --> 04:42.011
I'm sore sorry, uncle Kyle.
I need...

04:42.013 --> 04:43.946
Allow me to
take responsibility.

04:43.948 --> 04:45.581
I couldn't show up
to my first dinner party

04:45.583 --> 04:47.717
not looking my best.

04:47.719 --> 04:50.119
I don't recollect
meeting you before.

04:50.121 --> 04:52.021
May I introduce myself?

04:52.023 --> 04:53.790
Frank Dean.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.693
John Tilby.

04:56.695 --> 04:59.463
My wife,
Mrs. John Tilby.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.566
Pleasure.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.770
- My son Lane.
- Hello.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.515
Good evening.

05:24.689 --> 05:27.223
You're late.

05:27.225 --> 05:30.660
- Please forgive me. I was...
- You must be Ms. Richards.

05:30.662 --> 05:34.931
Harty speaks
very highly of you.

05:34.933 --> 05:36.799
I'm sure.

05:36.801 --> 05:40.035
Dinner will be
served shortly.

05:40.037 --> 05:41.807
Mm.

05:45.977 --> 05:48.180
After you.

05:56.587 --> 05:58.220
What do you do, Mr. Dean?

05:58.222 --> 06:01.758
I'm here to help Mr. Allison
with his business.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.126
Mining?

06:03.128 --> 06:06.228
No, not mining,

06:06.230 --> 06:08.098
but there are opportunities
above ground

06:08.100 --> 06:09.768
when there's gold beneath it.

06:11.837 --> 06:14.571
The future is upon us.

06:14.573 --> 06:16.973
The cowboys and savages
I read about as a child,

06:16.975 --> 06:20.042
they will soon be extinct.

06:20.044 --> 06:22.177
Opportunity is truly
paved from the ore

06:22.179 --> 06:23.949
that you gentlemen have pulled.

06:28.886 --> 06:31.220
Look at Mr. Allison.

06:31.222 --> 06:37.026
The man is a king,
investing his money so wisely.

06:37.028 --> 06:39.763
Your nephew tells me
that you alone

06:39.765 --> 06:43.600
brought electricity
to Goldfield.

06:43.602 --> 06:46.335
First in the state.

06:46.337 --> 06:50.006
Thanks to Mr. Allison's
generosity.

06:50.008 --> 06:55.548
Mm-hmm, yes,
he's a very generous man.

07:39.290 --> 07:42.626
Well, that was a fine meal.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.330
And this is an excellent
Kentucky bourbon.

07:53.304 --> 07:54.804
It's very good.

07:54.806 --> 07:56.038
Did you know it was
Thomas Jefferson

07:56.040 --> 07:58.243
who made Kentucky
bourbon country?

08:01.746 --> 08:03.812
Gave 60 acres
to the French farmers

08:03.814 --> 08:06.016
to raise their native crops

08:06.018 --> 08:09.155
as to honor their contribution
to the Revolutionary War.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.771
Thomas Jefferson
was an honorable man.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.280
Are you?

08:39.717 --> 08:42.784
- Answer him.
- Wait a second.

08:42.787 --> 08:45.822
- Sit down.
- Lane.

08:45.824 --> 08:47.823
We ain't done nothing.

08:47.825 --> 08:50.863
Sit down.

08:57.869 --> 09:03.039
Your daddy's been
undercutting me, son.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.811
Haven't you, John?

09:07.311 --> 09:12.748
Is this why you invited us,
to threaten me?

09:12.750 --> 09:17.187
Gentlemen,
we are just talking,

09:17.189 --> 09:20.793
but Mr. Allison,
he does expect the truth.

09:26.465 --> 09:28.300
I have done nothing.

09:30.234 --> 09:33.035
I'm not a fool.

09:33.037 --> 09:39.275
Well, a fool
doesn't get rich...

09:39.277 --> 09:42.348
and a dead man don't
take it with him.

09:50.055 --> 09:54.491
Well, I should
probably be going.

09:54.493 --> 09:56.729
Yes.

10:05.803 --> 10:07.372
Annabelle, we're leaving.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.021
- Let me show you out.
- No need.

10:42.173 --> 10:44.075
Think you got to him?

10:45.476 --> 10:49.045
I do, unless, of course,

10:49.047 --> 10:51.450
you'd like something more.

10:58.956 --> 11:01.290
What do you want?

11:01.292 --> 11:05.527
Is there anything I can do
for you, Mr. Allison?

11:05.529 --> 11:08.066
No.

11:15.206 --> 11:17.208
Well, you do have
her well trained.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.336
Well, gentlemen, I shall
retire for the evening.

11:46.338 --> 11:50.543
You should, both of you.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.183
Have yourself a
good night, Kyle.

12:05.523 --> 12:08.127
Mr. Dean?

12:12.364 --> 12:15.033
He'll have you
well trained too.

12:18.003 --> 12:20.406
I'm sure he will.

12:45.229 --> 12:48.399
You do have an interesting
family, Harty Allison.

13:10.154 --> 13:11.923
Ned and Sue have finished.

13:21.465 --> 13:25.070
You never said,
do you like my dress?

13:28.605 --> 13:31.376
I don't give a damn
about your dress.

13:36.413 --> 13:38.950
I thought you wanted
the gold one.

13:43.187 --> 13:45.590
Come here.

13:50.228 --> 13:52.631
Come on.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.404
Tilby was lying.

14:01.406 --> 14:04.042
I knew Tilby was a liar.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.716
I can't trust anyone.

14:14.185 --> 14:16.388
You can trust me.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.031
Trust you?

14:29.466 --> 14:34.603
Trust you?

14:34.605 --> 14:39.041
Why in the hell would
I ever trust you, huh?

14:39.043 --> 14:41.179
Huh?

14:43.514 --> 14:45.714
You're not well.
I'll leave you.

14:45.716 --> 14:47.784
Goodnight.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.388
Where you going?

15:01.699 --> 15:04.670
I saw the way you looked
at him tonight.

15:07.471 --> 15:11.442
I would never disrespect you
by looking at another man.

15:28.859 --> 15:31.462
I belong to you.

15:41.406 --> 15:43.872
Let me take you upstairs.

15:43.874 --> 15:47.376
Come on.

15:47.378 --> 15:49.580
Come on.

15:51.548 --> 15:54.318
That's right.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.386
I don't need your help,

15:58.388 --> 16:00.658
you whore.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.665
Come on, now.

16:11.668 --> 16:14.273
I got you.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.791
Good morning, Ms. Richards.

17:19.368 --> 17:23.306
Frank Dean's quite a man.

17:23.308 --> 17:27.710
He done told me about
some of the jobs he pulled,

17:27.712 --> 17:32.781
make your skin crawl
straight off.

17:32.783 --> 17:38.287
I assure you, sir, I had
no intentions of such a thing.

17:38.289 --> 17:42.390
My demeanor sometimes
can be misunderstood.

17:42.392 --> 17:45.627
Well, you can have
all your fancy words

17:45.629 --> 17:48.864
as long as we understand
one another.

17:48.866 --> 17:55.738
I'm here for you
and to get paid, that is all.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.343
Then get to work.

18:20.865 --> 18:22.501
You got me dirty.

18:38.282 --> 18:40.252
Ugh!

19:07.645 --> 19:08.879
It's notarized.

19:12.382 --> 19:14.418
You have the deed.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.962
You didn't have to beat my son.

19:26.964 --> 19:29.635
Oh, we would never do
a thing like that.

19:32.436 --> 19:34.406
Would we, Lane?

19:37.841 --> 19:40.445
No.

19:46.350 --> 19:49.952
I don't want my family in
danger over a misunderstanding.

19:49.954 --> 19:52.491
Well, then you should
probably leave town.

19:55.892 --> 19:58.496
Let's go.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.061
Henry James.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.871
Michael Dalton.

20:44.809 --> 20:49.548
No. Please.
I'll do whatever you want.

21:18.475 --> 21:22.113
You tell Kyle Allison
to go to hell!

21:37.928 --> 21:41.931
You've done well, Kentucky.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.732
Thank you, sir.

21:43.734 --> 21:47.470
I do appreciate
your kind words.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.174
I'm sure you do.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.514
Worth every penny.

22:10.761 --> 22:12.763
Good night.

22:24.007 --> 22:26.610
Get upstairs.

23:14.658 --> 23:17.061
Come here.

23:43.721 --> 23:46.355
Come on.

23:46.357 --> 23:49.528
Come on. God damn it.

23:51.262 --> 23:53.665
Get up!

23:55.332 --> 23:57.668
Get up! I said stand up.

24:00.638 --> 24:03.071
Get up.

24:03.073 --> 24:04.642
Stand up!

24:06.877 --> 24:10.613
Get up, you whore. Get up.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.982
It's all your fault,
you hear?

24:12.984 --> 24:15.753
It's all your fault!
You know it!

24:20.757 --> 24:22.691
This is your fault

24:22.693 --> 24:24.659
'cause you're not
pretty anymore.

24:24.661 --> 24:28.364
You know that? You're not
as pretty as you used to be!

25:12.676 --> 25:15.080
Well, howdy.

25:23.353 --> 25:24.655
What happened?

25:27.023 --> 25:29.290
Please.

25:29.292 --> 25:32.427
It's none of your concern.

25:32.429 --> 25:34.131
You're right, of course.
Forgive me.

25:36.199 --> 25:39.934
I was simply trying
to gain your trust.

25:39.936 --> 25:41.039
Why?

25:43.307 --> 25:47.443
I'd like to think
that we could be friends.

25:47.445 --> 25:49.914
Can we?

25:51.415 --> 25:54.019
You know why we can't.

25:58.188 --> 26:00.088
We may have had a tragic
beginning to our relationship...

26:00.090 --> 26:02.991
We don't have a
relationship, Mr. Dean.

26:02.993 --> 26:08.097
Kyle Allison is a pig of
a man, and I know you know it,

26:08.099 --> 26:10.898
and we both know
what he is capable of.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.469
Why are you saying this?

26:13.471 --> 26:16.307
A gentleman should
never strike a lady.

26:18.309 --> 26:20.912
You kill people.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.719
Only the bad ones.

26:34.225 --> 26:36.828
I can't be your friend.

27:25.876 --> 27:28.879
We are going out tonight.

27:29.946 --> 27:31.916
Put on that green dress.

27:47.965 --> 27:50.368
You deserve better.

29:26.664 --> 29:30.565
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, girl. Come on.

29:30.567 --> 29:32.033
Watch your step,
Ms. Richards.

29:32.035 --> 29:34.304
Thank you, Mr. Dean.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.491
Good evening.

29:56.126 --> 29:57.192
How are you doing,
Mr. Allison?

29:57.194 --> 29:59.293
Evening.

29:59.295 --> 30:02.164
- Ma'am.
- Mr. Allison.

30:02.166 --> 30:05.099
How you doing tonight?

30:05.101 --> 30:08.036
Evening.

30:08.038 --> 30:10.672
- Evening.
- Gentlemen.

30:10.674 --> 30:13.011
- How you doing, Mr. Allison?
- Evening.

30:28.658 --> 30:30.628
Good to see you.

30:44.273 --> 30:46.308
Good to see you.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.443
You're not cheating
again, are you?

30:48.445 --> 30:52.516
That a boy. How're the games?

30:54.451 --> 30:58.252
Mr. Allison, join us?

30:58.254 --> 31:02.060
By all means, deal me in.

31:31.621 --> 31:35.359
- Mr. Allison.
- Is this her?

31:37.061 --> 31:40.531
- This is Cora.
- Well.

31:46.803 --> 31:49.006
Get up.

31:51.675 --> 31:54.479
Now.

32:01.084 --> 32:04.286
This is Mr. Allison, Cora.

32:04.288 --> 32:07.458
You're going to live
with him now.

32:12.329 --> 32:14.465
Does that suit you, honey?

32:17.501 --> 32:20.104
Good.

32:48.197 --> 32:50.067
Kentucky.

33:02.311 --> 33:04.181
Darling, why don't you
come over here?

33:50.494 --> 33:52.597
You knew this day would come.

33:56.332 --> 33:58.735
What do I do?

34:01.237 --> 34:02.806
You come back to work.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.215
Where else will you go?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.552
I don't know.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.558
Come inside.

34:25.228 --> 34:30.268
I told you, I was his prize
long before you.

34:31.902 --> 34:36.741
Hold your head high.
Do not give him these tears.

34:45.014 --> 34:48.451
Come. Come.

36:13.837 --> 36:17.072
Are you ready to go?

36:17.074 --> 36:19.607
What about my things?

36:19.609 --> 36:21.578
We'll get you new things.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.114
Take us home.

36:27.116 --> 36:29.550
Hoo-ah, get up.

36:29.552 --> 36:31.022
Come on.

37:31.114 --> 37:32.646
Come on.

37:32.648 --> 37:33.882
- No.
- Maria...

37:33.884 --> 37:35.485
I said no!

37:41.625 --> 37:43.594
May I have a moment?

37:56.139 --> 37:58.743
Haven't you done
enough to her?

38:08.717 --> 38:11.087
You know what
he wants me to do.

38:17.127 --> 38:18.161
Get out.

38:20.764 --> 38:22.700
I won't do it.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.838
But you're not safe
in Goldfield.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.840
You have to leave.

38:32.842 --> 38:35.143
- Where?
- I'll take you to Johnson.

38:35.145 --> 38:37.715
You can catch a stagecoach
to wherever you want to go.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.624
I'm not staying here.

39:11.181 --> 39:13.784
Julie...

39:36.839 --> 39:39.242
Come on in.

39:43.679 --> 39:45.715
What do you think, huh?

39:48.652 --> 39:51.722
Why don't you take her on
upstairs and show her around?

39:56.793 --> 39:58.729
Come on, ma'am.

40:00.196 --> 40:03.831
Where's Julie?

40:03.833 --> 40:07.872
She won't be living here
anymore, Ned.

40:27.324 --> 40:30.991
How far is Johnson?

40:30.993 --> 40:35.896
Not far.

40:35.898 --> 40:37.965
But I do believe
this is far enough.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.034
Why are we stopping?

40:40.036 --> 40:42.673
- Get down.
- Why?

40:59.355 --> 41:02.625
Did you really think I would
love someone like you?

41:04.960 --> 41:07.895
Mr. Dean.

41:07.897 --> 41:11.701
So weak, worn.

41:14.304 --> 41:17.575
I'd be offended if I didn't
know how broken you truly are.

41:19.976 --> 41:25.712
You know, Kyle Allison,
he can't be trusted.

41:25.714 --> 41:29.252
I had no idea that he would
get rid of you like this.

41:33.790 --> 41:37.358
Our time has passed.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.927
Goodbye, Ms. Richards.

42:04.119 --> 42:06.723
Ms. Richards?

42:29.411 --> 42:32.015
Ms. Richards?

43:18.161 --> 43:20.164
I know
you're out here.

43:49.125 --> 43:51.962
If you choose to face your
fate, I will make it quick.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.248
I guess it'll be slow then.

47:22.505 --> 47:25.639
Maybe you're not as good
as I was told.

47:25.641 --> 47:27.775
So you've said.

47:27.777 --> 47:32.612
- Bested by a woman.
- Oh, I'll find her.

47:32.614 --> 47:35.416
Don't you worry about that.

47:35.418 --> 47:38.686
Yeah, well, take Harty.

47:38.688 --> 47:40.688
It's just Julie.

47:40.690 --> 47:43.961
Ain't nobody gonna listen
to a runned-away whore.

47:45.293 --> 47:50.433
Your mother was a whore,
you sniveling coward.

47:55.471 --> 47:58.074
Get the job done.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.616
You really think an Injun
can find her?

49:48.683 --> 49:51.487
If she's out here,
we'll find her.

50:30.525 --> 50:32.828
Hello.

50:48.944 --> 50:50.647
What's your name?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.670
I only brought you here
to get you fixed up.

51:15.404 --> 51:18.771
Least you can do
is tell me your name.

51:18.773 --> 51:21.844
Vince Wagner, you be nice.

51:25.281 --> 51:27.717
Hello, dear.

51:29.752 --> 51:33.253
Got a bad head wound.

51:33.255 --> 51:35.926
We've been keeping you out
so you could heal.

51:38.027 --> 51:40.263
Yup.

51:48.770 --> 51:51.407
Let's get you cleaned up.

51:55.043 --> 51:57.677
Her name's Julie.

51:57.679 --> 51:59.982
Julie.

52:00.982 --> 52:06.020
You know, wounds like that
take a while to heal.

52:06.022 --> 52:08.924
Don't you even think
about leaving her here.

52:10.326 --> 52:13.393
I won't.

52:13.395 --> 52:16.896
- What?
- You.

52:16.898 --> 52:18.831
You never surprise me.

52:18.833 --> 52:21.404
The things you bring
from the wild.

52:24.739 --> 52:26.810
You think she's an entertainer?

52:30.880 --> 52:33.450
Clothes like that
cost a lot.

53:08.650 --> 53:10.419
Those old clothes fit.

53:14.656 --> 53:16.558
I'll just let
the two of you be.

53:39.547 --> 53:41.950
Your name's Julie?

53:56.098 --> 54:00.433
Headed home tomorrow.

54:00.435 --> 54:04.670
You're welcome to come
with me if you want.

54:04.672 --> 54:06.507
Potter's Cross is a two-day
ride from there.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.911
You can catch a coach.

54:11.679 --> 54:13.582
I don't have any money.

54:19.755 --> 54:21.758
I don't want your money.

54:38.940 --> 54:42.911
Well, when you're ready enough
to travel, we'll go.

54:53.121 --> 54:56.657
- You take care of yourself.
- We'll see you soon.

54:56.659 --> 54:58.595
Sure you will, Vince Wagner.

56:24.779 --> 56:26.548
You catch horses?

56:32.054 --> 56:33.790
Mustangs.

56:35.924 --> 56:39.692
I wrangle mustangs...

56:39.694 --> 56:43.065
break 'em, sell 'em.

56:53.741 --> 56:55.277
Why?

57:04.185 --> 57:06.922
I like the life it provides.

58:16.157 --> 58:18.293
It's hot, Frank.

58:20.795 --> 58:25.701
We been out here a week,
ain't found nothing but that.

58:30.672 --> 58:33.709
Just take that to him
and just tell him she's dead.

58:47.322 --> 58:49.926
Why'd you shoot me?

59:33.402 --> 59:35.972
Shall we?

59:59.761 --> 01:00:01.128
Is that him?

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.733
Call him Chato.

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:18.878
Her name's Julie.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.081
She's scared of Chato.

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.052
You take some
getting used to.

01:00:27.855 --> 01:00:30.924
You live here?

01:00:30.926 --> 01:00:34.429
- Yup.
- With your Indian?

01:00:39.433 --> 01:00:41.269
Chato lives where he wants.

01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:52.512
She has some secrets.

01:00:52.514 --> 01:00:56.081
Yup, she does.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:58.420
She carries the weight.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:01.990
Yeah.

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:06.927
Should have left her
with the buzzards.

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:09.098
No, I'm glad she's here.

01:01:12.534 --> 01:01:14.503
Better to look
at than you.

01:01:21.976 --> 01:01:25.047
- She won't be here long.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:57.043
You're here now.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:02:01.184
Here and now is better
than wherever you were.

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:16.630
Headed down to the lake
to wash up for supper.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:22.936
Well, you want beans
or beans?

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:26.342
- Beans.
- I can do that.

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:30.413
You coming?

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.889
You smell like a horse.

01:02:48.462 --> 01:02:52.000
Go ahead. You can say it.

01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:58.040
"Vince, I am so glad
you brought me down here."

01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:04.947
I've never seen
so much water.

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:11.050
It's what I thought
the ocean would look like.

01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:15.424
It's not a bad place to live
in a tent.

01:03:20.728 --> 01:03:24.463
I'm getting in.

01:03:24.465 --> 01:03:26.402
- Coming?
- No.

01:03:31.072 --> 01:03:36.011
All right, missing out.

01:03:53.295 --> 01:03:54.463
You sure?

01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:01.703
Your loss.

01:04:35.337 --> 01:04:38.804
He isn't what I expected.

01:04:38.806 --> 01:04:41.674
Chato?

01:04:41.676 --> 01:04:46.545
He is a special breed of man.

01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.148
Wants to walk free

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.119
even when the world
doesn't want him to.

01:04:55.523 --> 01:04:58.560
Probably why I like
having him around so much.

01:05:00.594 --> 01:05:02.362
I'm starving.

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:04.766
You hungry?

01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:13.042
Come on.

01:05:28.156 --> 01:05:31.293
Chato here's the only survivor
of the Skeleton Cave Massacre.

01:05:35.362 --> 01:05:38.567
What is the Skeleton Cave
Massacre?

01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:45.471
Before the white man decided
to move us,

01:05:45.473 --> 01:05:47.609
they slaughtered my people.

01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:55.114
Cavalry killed 75.

01:05:55.116 --> 01:06:00.186
They had us surrounded...

01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:02.090
shot us from the mountaintops.

01:06:06.293 --> 01:06:09.197
He was eight.

01:06:10.364 --> 01:06:15.270
I'm not special.
I ran, to live.

01:06:22.777 --> 01:06:25.380
You don't have to
give me your tent.

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.551
I'll be fine.

01:06:36.257 --> 01:06:39.294
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:08:49.023 --> 01:08:51.627
Get, get.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:58.734
Hup.

01:09:08.075 --> 01:09:10.678
Hup, hup.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:16.049
Hup, hup, hup.

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.919
Get.
Come on.

01:09:41.475 --> 01:09:43.712
Hup, hup.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.654
Hup, hup, hup.

01:10:02.062 --> 01:10:03.898
How long's he been
doing this?

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.903
His whole life.

01:10:10.905 --> 01:10:13.475
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:55.648
Morning.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:58.751
Slept half the day away.

01:10:58.753 --> 01:11:01.019
I think she's
getting used to us.

01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:04.457
May I ride him?

01:11:04.459 --> 01:11:07.025
No, he ain't ready
for you yet.

01:11:07.027 --> 01:11:09.561
I can do it.

01:11:09.563 --> 01:11:12.698
Now, this ain't no show pony.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.470
Here.

01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:27.447
Take it easy, Julie.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.124
Ease off, Julie.

01:11:41.562 --> 01:11:43.796
Argh.

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:46.802
- Whoa, boy.
- You all right?

01:11:52.473 --> 01:11:53.506
Here, let me have
a look at you...

01:11:53.508 --> 01:11:56.678
- No!
- All right.

01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.685
Told you not to ride
that horse.

01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:11.058
I don't need you
to tell me anything.

01:12:13.695 --> 01:12:16.595
I have spent my whole life

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:21.836
having men tell me what to do,
and I'm done!

01:12:27.075 --> 01:12:30.275
- What would I know about that?
- Nothing.

01:12:30.277 --> 01:12:32.612
- That's right, I don't.
- You don't know anything.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:36.849
I don't.

01:12:36.851 --> 01:12:39.987
- Go on, then.
- I will.

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:48.897
Don't.

01:13:47.588 --> 01:13:49.991
Should we check on her?

01:13:54.896 --> 01:13:57.299
Let her be.

01:15:58.252 --> 01:16:00.155
I think I want to try again.

01:16:58.312 --> 01:17:00.048
You did good today.

01:17:17.932 --> 01:17:21.203
Never known this kind
of kindness...

01:17:27.508 --> 01:17:29.978
From a man.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.827
I ran away from the army.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:54.268
I saw it was doing terrible
things to people like Chato.

01:18:03.044 --> 01:18:05.113
Guess that's why
I keep him so close.

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:13.321
And I kind of like him,
I guess.

01:18:21.094 --> 01:18:24.365
I never met people like you
and Chato before.

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:33.174
Don't think
you ever will again.

01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.451
Probably not.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.834
If you knew who I was,
you would have left me there.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:15.517
I doubt it.

01:19:25.493 --> 01:19:28.029
I want to tell you
everything.

01:19:50.317 --> 01:19:53.418
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.587
My name
is Franklin Bennett Dean.

01:19:56.589 --> 01:19:58.560
Might I inquire of you?

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.905
The Andersons.

01:20:27.021 --> 01:20:28.523
- Hey, Vince.
- Hello.

01:20:39.165 --> 01:20:41.136
Thanks, Chato.

01:20:55.281 --> 01:20:59.784
- It is so good to see you.
- How was your trip?

01:20:59.786 --> 01:21:03.223
- Good, good, good.
- Who you got there?

01:21:04.624 --> 01:21:08.127
Did you run off and
finally find you a woman?

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:11.329
Well, now,
not like you're thinking.

01:21:11.331 --> 01:21:13.468
I'm sure.

01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:20.405
Uh, Julie Richards, this is
Cal and Ellie Anderson.

01:21:20.407 --> 01:21:23.074
Ma'am, nice to meet you.

01:21:23.076 --> 01:21:28.048
- This here is Buffer.
- It is so nice to meet you.

01:21:34.588 --> 01:21:38.058
She is a beautiful thing.

01:21:40.294 --> 01:21:44.729
- She's wearing boy clothes.
- Now, son.

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:47.166
Yes, she is.

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:51.603
Well, about time
someone made him honest.

01:21:51.605 --> 01:21:53.540
Ain't that right, Cal?

01:21:57.244 --> 01:21:59.047
Yup.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:05.184
We own the general
in Pine Creek,

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:10.122
keep Vince and Chato
in supplies, trade for horses.

01:22:10.124 --> 01:22:13.495
Cal does like his horses.

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:18.529
I think it's 'cause
he hates working the store.

01:22:18.531 --> 01:22:23.234
We have employees.
What are you doing?

01:22:23.236 --> 01:22:24.802
- Nothing.
- That is shameful

01:22:24.804 --> 01:22:26.505
in front of a lady.

01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:29.411
You go on. Get out there
with pa, now. Scoot.

01:22:32.379 --> 01:22:34.880
Sorry about that.

01:22:34.882 --> 01:22:37.419
Sometimes he acts
like a critter.

01:22:43.557 --> 01:22:46.625
What do you say, Buffer?
What do you think of this one?

01:22:46.627 --> 01:22:49.427
You ever think about
having children?

01:22:49.429 --> 01:22:51.662
- No.
- You should.

01:22:51.664 --> 01:22:54.435
You'd make some
very pretty babies.

01:22:56.637 --> 01:23:01.206
You ask me, you should be
considering Vince.

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:04.112
That man is ripe.

01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:10.916
You know, there's a wedding and
a barn dance tomorrow night.

01:23:10.918 --> 01:23:12.818
I can never get Vince
to go to these things.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:16.491
I don't know why.
Everyone loves him.

01:23:19.226 --> 01:23:22.728
Vince Wagner,

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:28.167
you are bringing Miss Julie
to the town social tomorrow.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:31.639
I won't hear
another thing about it.

01:23:34.441 --> 01:23:36.211
Oh, hell.

01:23:39.312 --> 01:23:42.314
It's settled, then.

01:23:42.316 --> 01:23:44.586
Sorry, Vince.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.487
See y'all tomorrow?

01:23:48.489 --> 01:23:52.494
Now, come early so we can look
at getting her into a dress.

01:23:56.429 --> 01:23:57.898
Come on.

01:24:02.236 --> 01:24:04.839
Don't be late.

01:24:10.276 --> 01:24:11.913
Well, have a good time.

01:24:21.588 --> 01:24:24.756
She can be a bit much.

01:24:24.758 --> 01:24:26.561
I thought she was nice.

01:24:31.365 --> 01:24:34.335
Thought you were taking me
to Potter's Crossing tomorrow.

01:24:36.503 --> 01:24:38.436
Yeah.

01:24:38.438 --> 01:24:41.939
Yeah, I guess I was.

01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:43.810
Maybe we can go from there.

01:24:46.312 --> 01:24:50.185
Yeah, we can.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.688
Well, I'd best get back
to getting these horses

01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:59.294
ready then.

01:25:41.567 --> 01:25:45.537
Almost there.

01:25:45.539 --> 01:25:47.942
Almost.

01:25:49.977 --> 01:25:52.247
There you are.

01:25:57.584 --> 01:25:59.320
Mm-hmm.

01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:06.692
When you were
a girl you did that?

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.958
How did you wear it?

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.095
- Just like this.
- Just like this?

01:26:11.097 --> 01:26:14.502
Wait till Vince
gets a load of you.

01:26:28.682 --> 01:26:30.551
There.

01:26:33.353 --> 01:26:36.387
Done.

01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:39.560
Well? What do you think?

01:26:47.034 --> 01:26:51.802
Beautiful. Beautiful.

01:26:51.804 --> 01:26:55.043
- Thank you, Ms. Ellie.
- You are welcome.

01:27:00.513 --> 01:27:02.883
Let's go show Vince.

01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:12.860
Vince?

01:27:29.743 --> 01:27:34.514
- You look...
- I already told her that.

01:27:36.549 --> 01:27:38.352
You look pretty.

01:27:49.695 --> 01:27:52.596
We're late.

01:27:52.598 --> 01:27:54.835
Go on, now.

01:28:05.745 --> 01:28:07.479
Now, Buffer,
we are at a wedding,

01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:10.515
so remember to mind
your manners, all right?

01:28:10.517 --> 01:28:14.719
Stay with me until
they introduce everybody...

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:18.223
Buffer Dee Anderson!

01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:20.725
Why does he keep
running ahead like that?

01:28:20.727 --> 01:28:23.561
He's just a boy.
He'll be fine.

01:28:23.563 --> 01:28:25.967
I think he sees his friends.

01:28:36.008 --> 01:28:39.713
So good to see you.
It's so good to see you.

01:28:43.816 --> 01:28:46.587
Oh, I brought some pie
for the bride.

01:28:48.088 --> 01:28:50.721
Go ahead.
Go help your mama.

01:28:50.723 --> 01:28:52.823
How are you all doing?

01:28:52.825 --> 01:28:54.728
Good to see you.

01:29:01.634 --> 01:29:05.903
- You ready for this?
- Are you?

01:29:05.905 --> 01:29:08.775
I'm not. Not that you care.

01:29:52.252 --> 01:29:54.989
Told you he's the most
eligible around here.

01:30:04.231 --> 01:30:06.634
You all right?

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:26.687
