WEBVTT

00:03.820 --> 00:05.421
(GROANS)

00:08.746 --> 00:10.737
Nothing like an ice-cold beer

00:10.738 --> 00:12.495
- after a job well done.
- Yeah.

00:12.496 --> 00:15.472
You know, the Brits
like their beer warm...

00:15.473 --> 00:16.764
and their cars are cruddy.

00:16.765 --> 00:19.477
- I wonder if there's a connection.
- Ah.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.103
They get a pass.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.963
- They gave me Adele.
- Heh.

00:23.964 --> 00:25.756
You know, man, thanks to us,

00:25.757 --> 00:27.978
this Corvair is as good as it was

00:27.979 --> 00:30.410
when it rolled off the
assembly line in 1963.

00:30.411 --> 00:31.663
- Actually...
- Yes!

00:31.664 --> 00:34.164
... better. Huh?

00:34.165 --> 00:36.300
- Ported and polished heads.
- Mm-hmm.

00:36.301 --> 00:38.302
- This baby's an animal.
- Mm.

00:38.303 --> 00:41.238
A slow, stupid little animal.

00:41.239 --> 00:44.441
But still fast enough to
roll over on Ralph Nader.

00:45.844 --> 00:48.012
You know, that buyer Joe found for me

00:48.013 --> 00:49.337
is gonna be really happy.

00:49.338 --> 00:51.248
That's 'cause he's
done dealing with Joe.

00:51.249 --> 00:53.317
- Mm.
- "Done dealing with Joe".

00:53.318 --> 00:56.320
You add a pickup truck to
that, that's a country song.

00:56.321 --> 00:58.155
Got to admit, this...

00:58.156 --> 01:00.991
- was a pretty good time.
- Yeah, why is it we don't argue

01:00.992 --> 01:02.526
when we're working on a car?

01:02.527 --> 01:05.029
'Cause all we say is, "Give me a beer",

01:05.030 --> 01:07.865
"You need a beer?" "We
got to get more beer".

01:09.652 --> 01:11.443
I almost wish there was
something wrong with my truck

01:11.444 --> 01:13.470
so we could have a
project for next weekend.

01:13.471 --> 01:15.372
Easily done. I'll take a screwdriver

01:15.373 --> 01:18.275
and poke a hole in your radiator.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.484
That's the best spaghetti
you've ever made.

01:27.485 --> 01:29.286
I licked my plate clean.

01:29.287 --> 01:32.323
My tongue marks have actually
turned this into a painting.

01:32.324 --> 01:34.858
Look. A sailboat.

01:34.859 --> 01:38.395
Okay, well, what do you know?
I'm married to Jackson Pol-lick.

01:39.397 --> 01:41.031
Heh-heh.

01:41.032 --> 01:44.368
Great food, bad puns...
our marriage in a nutshell.

01:44.369 --> 01:47.971
You know, working on cars always
puts you in such a great mood.

01:47.972 --> 01:50.474
Or maybe it's just being
trapped in the garage

01:50.475 --> 01:52.910
with all those noxious fumes.

01:52.911 --> 01:56.880
Well, nothing like a
CO2 and benzene cocktail.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.850
Actually, working with Chuck
had a lot to do with it.

01:59.851 --> 02:01.743
- Hey, whoa, whoa. Wow.
- Ooh.

02:01.744 --> 02:03.821
I thought you always wanted
to be alone with your cars.

02:03.822 --> 02:05.723
You put an engine between Chuck and I,

02:05.724 --> 02:07.825
it turns out... he's a lot of fun.

02:07.826 --> 02:11.762
Look at you... enjoying
the company of humans.

02:11.763 --> 02:13.597
Yeah, all right, just one guy,

02:13.598 --> 02:16.834
and don't forget the benzene fumes.

02:16.835 --> 02:19.837
I think this is a very
healthy change for you.

02:19.838 --> 02:23.503
You know, as men age,
strong social connections

02:23.504 --> 02:25.109
can help them live longer.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.411
Ah. Look at you... wanting me to live.

02:27.412 --> 02:29.847
Yeah.

02:29.848 --> 02:32.349
But I think I figured out a way
to add more of this to my life.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.051
- Oh, I like that.
- I'm thinking of having

02:34.052 --> 02:37.287
a side business flipping
classic cars with Chuck.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.690
I'm liking it less.

02:39.691 --> 02:41.825
The expansion at Outdoor
Man has calmed down.

02:41.826 --> 02:43.027
The kids are out of the house.

02:43.028 --> 02:44.895
You want me to live longer.

02:44.896 --> 02:46.430
Yeah, okay, but, you know,

02:46.431 --> 02:48.565
you've always found
working on cars to be fun.

02:48.566 --> 02:50.825
You need the escape. It might ruin it

02:50.826 --> 02:52.951
- if you make it all about money.
- More money?

02:52.952 --> 02:56.436
(IMITATING THURSTON HOWELL III):
What would we do with more money?

02:56.437 --> 03:00.744
We could add a second
wine cellar to the yacht.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.580
(IMITATING DICKENSIAN CHILD):
A cellar? Oh, I'd give anything

03:03.581 --> 03:05.783
just to live in one!

03:07.185 --> 03:08.619
(NORMAL VOICE): Be gone,
you little ragamuffin!

03:08.620 --> 03:10.454
And take the mice with you. Get out.

03:10.455 --> 03:12.656
Okay, all right, all right.
Look I'm just saying,

03:12.657 --> 03:14.925
you've had two great loves of your life:

03:14.926 --> 03:17.895
the outdoors and classic cars.

03:17.896 --> 03:20.264
You're a solid number three, Lovey.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.635
Wow. I finally edged out Elway.

03:26.337 --> 03:29.173
Oh, I forgot about Elway.

03:29.174 --> 03:31.809
Listen, you-you've turned
your love of the outdoors

03:31.810 --> 03:34.841
into a business, which...
which you still find fun.

03:34.842 --> 03:37.493
But-but admit it, I mean,
it can be kind of stressful.

03:37.494 --> 03:38.900
And I'd hate to see that happen

03:38.901 --> 03:40.150
- with you and cars.
- All right, all right.

03:40.151 --> 03:41.952
I can still keep it
fun. I will keep it...

03:41.953 --> 03:44.087
And haven't you read that
being married to a man

03:44.088 --> 03:47.224
that's having fun helps
aging women live longer?

03:48.893 --> 03:50.494
No, no, no.

03:50.495 --> 03:53.430
But I did read that men
who call their wives "aging"

03:53.431 --> 03:55.866
tend to die suddenly. Yep.

04:02.874 --> 04:04.508
What are you doing?

04:04.509 --> 04:06.677
We're gonna get lunch as
soon as Mom and Jen get here.

04:06.678 --> 04:08.679
Tell that to the beast baby within.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.948
Why would you not have cocktail onions?

04:10.949 --> 04:12.049
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:12.050 --> 04:14.451
Ooh.

04:14.452 --> 04:16.720
Hi. Oh, what's with the boxes?

04:16.721 --> 04:18.288
Can you keep a secret?

04:18.289 --> 04:20.524
Your mom and I are porch pirates.

04:20.524 --> 04:22.893
- Arr!
- All right, she's kidding.

04:22.894 --> 04:25.362
Look, I brought you the stuff
you left in the basement.

04:25.363 --> 04:28.022
Please tell me she left some
cocktail onions down there.

04:28.023 --> 04:29.081
They don't show this

04:29.082 --> 04:31.083
in the joyful pregnancy
test commercials.

04:31.636 --> 04:33.403
Well, thanks for bringing my stuff.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.072
Did you also bring the mannequin?

04:35.073 --> 04:36.807
Oh, I'll bring it by tomorrow.

04:36.808 --> 04:40.344
Your dad's been using it to
drive in the carpool lane.

04:40.345 --> 04:42.366
Hey, Mandy, what's this?

04:42.367 --> 04:43.547
Oh, that's our chore list.

04:43.548 --> 04:45.073
Uh, since we have our own place,

04:45.074 --> 04:47.251
Kyle and I decided to
split the housework.

04:47.252 --> 04:49.253
My parents had a chore list.

04:49.254 --> 04:52.689
I kept adding: "Let Jen
watch <i>Magic Mike".</i>

04:52.690 --> 04:55.192
Oh, but no dice.

04:55.193 --> 04:57.861
Men taking off their clothes. Big deal.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.564
Show me a man putting
away the clean dishes...

05:00.565 --> 05:02.533
(GROWLS)

05:03.501 --> 05:05.402
Whoa. Who's chore is it

05:05.403 --> 05:07.061
to take out the recycling, huh?

05:07.062 --> 05:08.720
Oh, technically me, but
you can just leave it.

05:08.721 --> 05:09.912
Kyle will take care of it.

05:09.913 --> 05:12.305
Honey, I hope you're not making
Kyle do all your chores.

05:12.306 --> 05:13.597
No. He likes it.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.223
I-I just wait a little bit,

05:15.224 --> 05:17.315
and he steps in and he does it for me.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.041
He's so sweet.

05:19.042 --> 05:21.167
You're taking advantage of him.

05:21.168 --> 05:22.593
Why are you surprised, Mom?

05:22.594 --> 05:24.452
She did the same thing to me growing up.

05:24.453 --> 05:27.179
And then you both did the same
thing to me when I got here.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.805
And we loved you for it.

05:29.806 --> 05:32.031
The difference is that
Kyle likes doing it, okay?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.625
I-I'm just letting him
do what he likes to do

05:34.626 --> 05:37.100
by not doing what I don't like to do.

05:37.101 --> 05:39.269
I know English is my second language,

05:39.270 --> 05:41.538
but that sounds like a load of crap.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.273
It's just like with the boxes.

05:43.274 --> 05:46.276
You know, I left them in the
basement, he brought them to me,

05:46.277 --> 05:48.145
everyone's happy.

05:48.146 --> 05:49.904
Mandy, this is important. You...

05:49.905 --> 05:52.197
Can we go? You can run
her life at the diner.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.700
Okay? Come on, let's go.

05:57.655 --> 05:59.523
- Larabee.
- Huh?

05:59.524 --> 06:01.391
Get in my office. I want to talk to you.

06:01.392 --> 06:04.995
I want to talk to you, too,
but I was gonna be polite.

06:09.634 --> 06:10.711
What's up?

06:10.712 --> 06:13.270
Listen, we both liked
working on that Corvair.

06:13.271 --> 06:15.973
Okay. Don't worry, Baxter.
I saw you having fun.

06:15.974 --> 06:18.008
I won't tell anybody.

06:18.009 --> 06:20.477
Look at this website... classic cars.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.479
- Ah.
- What do you say we buy one of these,

06:22.480 --> 06:24.481
fix it up, use the profits
to build another one?

06:24.482 --> 06:26.016
Man, that's funny, man. I was thinking

06:26.017 --> 06:27.642
about turning this into a business, too.

06:27.643 --> 06:30.454
No, like a side business... just
two guys funding their hobby.

06:30.455 --> 06:31.588
It'll be fun.

06:31.589 --> 06:33.590
Fun is my middle name.

06:33.591 --> 06:36.660
I think you told me it was Marion.

06:36.661 --> 06:40.263
I share too much when
I'm working on cars.

06:40.264 --> 06:42.820
But what if it wasn't just two guys?

06:42.821 --> 06:44.701
Damn, I-I'm barely
able to work with you.

06:44.702 --> 06:46.683
I don't think I could work
with another guy. I can't do...

06:46.684 --> 06:48.171
What the... ?

06:48.172 --> 06:49.606
Hey, Chuck.

06:51.142 --> 06:53.977
You tell this numbskull we
might let him work with us?

06:55.013 --> 06:58.482
Charles Marion Larabee...

06:58.483 --> 07:00.851
what have you done?

07:07.851 --> 07:08.955
You invited Joe in on this,

07:08.956 --> 07:11.153
the most annoying guy
in the world? What...

07:11.154 --> 07:13.322
- Gilbert Gottfried was busy?
- CHUCK: Okay, okay.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.604
Joe, Joe, c-could you
give us a second, man?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.772
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:18.773 --> 07:20.407
I'm back. (CHUCKLES)

07:22.043 --> 07:24.077
I'm just kidding. Look,
take all the time you want.

07:24.078 --> 07:27.380
Remember... we don't need Baxter.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.485
Really? Joe?

07:32.486 --> 07:34.688
I wanted to keep this fun and simple.

07:34.689 --> 07:36.723
Joe? Just simple.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.792
I know he's annoying,

07:38.793 --> 07:42.128
but he's connected with
gearheads all over town,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.297
and he's a very, very good mechanic.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.632
All that would be great

07:45.633 --> 07:47.467
if it weren't Joe.

07:47.993 --> 07:50.018
Since Joe set me up

07:50.019 --> 07:51.634
with the guy who bought the Corvair,

07:51.635 --> 07:54.107
technically, he's the one that
got this whole ball rolling.

07:54.108 --> 07:55.593
Guy drives me nuts.

07:55.594 --> 07:57.611
I can't-I can't do it. I can't. I'm...

07:57.612 --> 08:00.547
Hey, guy, you don't want to
work with me, that's fine.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.649
Okay?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.651
I'll tell my friend who was looking

08:04.652 --> 08:07.687
for a '68 Mustang Fastback
to find somebody else.

08:10.191 --> 08:12.125
- '68 Fastback?
- Uh-huh.

08:12.126 --> 08:15.595
Yeah, he wants to drop
a 428 Cobra Jet in it.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.265
I-I'm gonna regret this.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.935
All right, Joe, you're in.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.136
Yeah.

08:23.137 --> 08:25.505
You said "urine".

08:29.110 --> 08:31.478
Regret, regret...

08:31.479 --> 08:33.145
regret.

08:37.485 --> 08:39.052
(KNOCKING)

08:42.123 --> 08:44.457
KYLE: Oh! (GIGGLES)

08:44.458 --> 08:45.659
(LAUGHS)

08:45.660 --> 08:47.661
- Hey, Mrs. B.
- Hi, Kyle.

08:47.662 --> 08:50.163
Sorry, I'm just dropping
that off for Mandy.

08:50.164 --> 08:52.599
There's a guy who sits in Mr. B's truck

08:52.600 --> 08:54.367
who has the same hat.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.337
Thanks for bringing this by.

08:57.338 --> 08:59.005
Hey, and I can walk you back down.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.041
I'm getting ready to take
out the recycling anyway.

09:01.042 --> 09:03.476
Oh. Right. Uh, look, Kyle,

09:03.477 --> 09:05.549
I saw the, uh, the chore list

09:05.550 --> 09:07.745
that-that you and Mandy
put up on the refrigerator.

09:07.746 --> 09:11.551
Um, I could have sworn that
recycling was Mandy's job.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.154
Oh, yeah, yeah, it is, but,
you know, it's been piling up.

09:14.155 --> 09:15.555
And, uh, and I don't mind.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.390
Besides, I... I love the clinkety-clank

09:17.391 --> 09:19.826
of the recycling bag being
carried down the steps.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.494
(CLATTERING)

09:21.495 --> 09:24.164
(FORCED CHUCKLE) Yeah, small pleasures.

09:24.165 --> 09:26.800
Uh, so, Kyle, uh,

09:26.801 --> 09:30.170
do-do you end up doing
a lot of her chores?

09:30.171 --> 09:32.639
I guess so. She forgets a lot.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.874
But... I like doing things for her.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.810
Yeah. Well, just curious...
I mean, how-how many

09:36.811 --> 09:38.812
of her chores does she actually do?

09:38.813 --> 09:40.747
Well, uh...

09:40.748 --> 09:42.549
she doesn't do the laundry.

09:42.550 --> 09:44.751
But she does leave it all
over the bedroom floor.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.785
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.478
That way I don't have
to go looking for it.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.890
And, uh, she didn't clean the kitchen.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.859
But she did sweep once.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.261
But that's just because
she broke a glass.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.163
It... Well, I guess it
really wasn't sweeping

09:57.164 --> 10:00.734
as much as it was just kicking
the pieces under the stove.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.337
(CLICKS TONGUE) Uh, Kyle, I...

10:04.338 --> 10:08.208
I don't want to insert
myself into your marriage...

10:12.179 --> 10:13.413
But?

10:13.414 --> 10:16.616
(CHUCKLES) Well, since you ask. Uh...

10:16.617 --> 10:19.719
Look, Mandy is using you,
and-and it has to stop.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.323
You think she's ignoring
her chores on purpose?

10:23.324 --> 10:25.258
Does recycling go clickety-clank?

10:25.259 --> 10:27.460
- (CLATTERING)
- Look, look,

10:27.461 --> 10:29.396
if Mandy's gonna do her fair share,

10:29.397 --> 10:31.965
you-you have to stop
doing her chores for her.

10:33.401 --> 10:35.335
Yeah, but she's so
tall and pretty, so...

10:35.336 --> 10:38.471
Oh, yeah, well, that is a factor.

10:40.274 --> 10:41.274
Look...

10:41.275 --> 10:43.343
but over time, Kyle,

10:43.344 --> 10:45.345
you might end up resenting Mandy,

10:45.346 --> 10:48.948
and resentments pile up,
much like your recycling.

10:50.518 --> 10:51.951
All right.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.021
Yeah. Yeah, I'll put it
all back the way it was.

10:55.022 --> 10:58.558
But it is gonna take forever
to un-crush all these cans.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.175
Listen. Okay, Joe, where are
we gonna get this '68 Mustang?

11:05.176 --> 11:06.800
Yeah, my buddy had one of those, man.

11:06.801 --> 11:08.601
It was a total chick magnet.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.270
Yeah, my friend can't afford it anymore.

11:10.271 --> 11:12.639
- Why?
- Ah, the idiot's getting a divorce.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.300
Well, maybe his wife wants it.

11:14.301 --> 11:16.342
Tell <i>her</i> it's a chick magnet.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.431
How'd you know that's why
he's getting a divorce?

11:21.582 --> 11:24.984
Okay, so, we need another
buyer. Um, uh, okay,

11:24.985 --> 11:28.188
my brother-in-law always
wanted a '67 Valiant.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.323
(SCOFFS) Keep looking.

11:30.324 --> 11:31.925
A '67 Valiant?

11:31.926 --> 11:35.161
That went out of style in '66.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.028
Hey, how 'bout a Karmann Ghia?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.331
A little sports car could be nice.

11:38.332 --> 11:39.766
We just finished a Corvair, man.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.493
I want something with a
little more meat on its bones.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.269
Okay, okay, okay. I'm
sensing a problem here.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.210
See, we couldn't agree
on a-a business name,

11:46.211 --> 11:48.374
a logo or the best James Bond.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.643
(IMITATES SEAN CONNERY):
The answer's obvious.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.045
(NORMAL VOICE): Timothy Dalton.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.516
This is exactly why we need
to put someone in charge.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.785
You know, to make decisions.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.186
Oh, not me. I-I...

12:00.187 --> 12:01.788
Too much stress on me.
I don't want to do it.

12:01.789 --> 12:05.125
Well, that only leaves one person.

12:05.126 --> 12:06.459
Joe.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.294
(CHUCKLES) Joe?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.662
I hope you mean Joe Biden,

12:09.663 --> 12:11.631
'cause I'd hate that a little bit less.

12:11.632 --> 12:13.466
Come on, guys. I can handle it.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.903
Hey, you try putting six cats
on the same feeding schedule.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.906
Listen, Joe may not know science,

12:19.907 --> 12:22.142
history, logic...

12:22.143 --> 12:24.043
grammar or social cues...

12:25.846 --> 12:28.248
... but he does know cars.

12:28.249 --> 12:31.851
Come on, guys. I got motor
oil in my veins, all right?

12:31.852 --> 12:34.487
I-It's really just
high cholesterol, but...

12:34.488 --> 12:35.855
(MUTTERS)

12:35.856 --> 12:37.924
Look, fine. Have at it. It's yours.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.926
As Goldfinger said so aptly,

12:39.927 --> 12:41.027
"No, Mr. Bond.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.662
I expect you to die".

12:43.697 --> 12:45.532
Hang on.

12:45.533 --> 12:48.368
If I'm the boss, there's gonna
be some changes here, okay?

12:48.369 --> 12:51.472
First, we're all getting satin jackets.

12:53.674 --> 12:55.875
I'm not wearing a satin jacket.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.611
We're not gonna <i>wear</i> 'em.

12:58.612 --> 13:02.248
And, second, I'd like
to be addressed as "sir".

13:02.249 --> 13:03.642
(GROANS) Come on, Joe.

13:03.643 --> 13:05.251
We're all in this to have fun.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.877
Whoa, whoa, what's with this "Joe"?

13:06.878 --> 13:09.222
I think the word you're
looking for is "sir".

13:09.223 --> 13:11.225
It's not the word I'm looking for.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:22.307 --> 13:25.643
Mike, why is Joe wearing a tie?

13:25.644 --> 13:27.311
Because, technically,

13:27.312 --> 13:29.947
he's the boss of our new endeavor.

13:29.948 --> 13:33.017
Why is it a Christmas tie?

13:33.018 --> 13:34.952
He's probably just got the one,

13:34.953 --> 13:38.222
and he wants to make sure
everybody knows who's in charge.

13:38.223 --> 13:39.724
Ah, leadership.

13:39.725 --> 13:41.159
Yeah, it's a heady cocktail.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.394
Long hours, lazy workers, huh?

13:43.395 --> 13:44.395
(CHUCKLES)

13:44.396 --> 13:47.065
I miss it.

13:47.066 --> 13:48.900
I just want to work on cars, right?

13:48.901 --> 13:50.902
I don't want to take orders from Joe.

13:50.903 --> 13:53.671
I'm not one of his cats.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.573
You know, when you're the boss,

13:55.574 --> 13:56.908
Joe's a pain in your ass,

13:56.909 --> 13:59.544
so why don't you return the favor?

13:59.545 --> 14:01.345
Well, how would that help anybody?

14:01.346 --> 14:04.215
Well, you like to annoy people, right?

14:05.818 --> 14:07.385
Sure. Who doesn't?

14:08.420 --> 14:10.088
The nice.

14:10.089 --> 14:11.522
And since you're not,

14:11.523 --> 14:14.659
this might be a good way to
put the fun back into this.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.894
I like it.

14:16.895 --> 14:19.330
It's better than my murder
plan. (SHORT CHUCKLE)

14:19.331 --> 14:21.432
- That requires an alibi.
- Well...

14:21.433 --> 14:23.365
This a good time for a meeting, Baxter?

14:23.366 --> 14:25.768
Doesn't matter. A good time
is when the boss says it is.

14:25.769 --> 14:28.003
And, right now, he ain't the boss.

14:29.039 --> 14:30.539
Happy holidays.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.043
Sure, a good time for a
meeting. This is great.

14:34.044 --> 14:35.778
I'm here to serve, boss.

14:35.779 --> 14:38.047
Oh. Well, you got a new attitude.

14:38.048 --> 14:40.783
That's scary.

14:40.784 --> 14:43.218
Now, I looked up how to
start a business, okay?

14:43.219 --> 14:44.420
And we need a website

14:44.421 --> 14:46.021
- and a license.
- Whoa.

14:46.022 --> 14:48.023
That's a... that's a
lot of business jargon.

14:48.024 --> 14:50.292
Can you dumb that down a little bit?

14:50.293 --> 14:52.394
Well, there's a lot to do. Uh, Chuck,

14:52.395 --> 14:54.396
- you're in computers...
- You just said "urine".

14:54.397 --> 14:56.265
(CHUCKLES) He said "urine".

14:56.266 --> 14:57.600
Can we cut the chitchat?

14:57.601 --> 14:59.117
I'm trying to run a meeting here.

14:59.118 --> 15:01.036
Well, I guess I could take
a crack at the website.

15:01.037 --> 15:02.605
You just said "crack". (LAUGHS)

15:06.476 --> 15:08.644
If you're looking for cocktail onions,

15:08.645 --> 15:10.145
- they're in the pantry.
- (GROANS)

15:10.146 --> 15:13.048
Don't even say those words to me.

15:13.049 --> 15:15.451
We went to three stores
to find the kind you like.

15:15.452 --> 15:16.952
We thought you had a craving.

15:16.953 --> 15:18.053
That was then.

15:18.054 --> 15:20.723
Today, I'm feeling a brick of feta.

15:21.745 --> 15:23.069
You broke my husband.

15:23.070 --> 15:25.060
Oh, Mandy, you know what,
you were tricking him.

15:25.061 --> 15:26.261
It's not healthy.

15:26.262 --> 15:29.732
Screw healthy. We were happy.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.834
That's because Kyle is always happy.

15:31.835 --> 15:34.103
Yeah, well, that's one of
the reasons I married him.

15:34.104 --> 15:37.106
I don't have to work to make him happy.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.074
He came that way.

15:41.511 --> 15:43.245
Are you eating olives and whipped cream?

15:43.246 --> 15:44.813
What am I supposed to do?

15:44.814 --> 15:46.582
There's no feta!

15:48.818 --> 15:51.153
Anyway, thanks a lot, Mom.

15:51.154 --> 15:52.755
Now I have to do my laundry,

15:52.756 --> 15:54.957
and some slob left
it all over the floor.

15:56.793 --> 15:58.961
Mandy, remember I told you

15:58.962 --> 16:00.863
my parents had a chore list also?

16:00.864 --> 16:02.831
Yeah, yeah. That's
because, in every culture,

16:02.832 --> 16:05.720
marriage is about work and
shared responsibilities.

16:05.721 --> 16:07.512
I mean, that's-that's
what you were gonna say.

16:07.513 --> 16:08.671
Right, Jen?

16:08.672 --> 16:10.639
No.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.842
My mother loved flowers.

16:13.843 --> 16:15.611
She grew roses in her garden.

16:15.612 --> 16:17.846
And even though my father
didn't care about flowers,

16:17.847 --> 16:19.448
he had to prune them and clip one

16:19.449 --> 16:21.283
for the dinner table every night.

16:22.519 --> 16:23.952
After my mother died,

16:23.953 --> 16:26.622
my father continued
to maintain her garden.

16:26.623 --> 16:30.125
So I asked him why he
still did this chore.

16:30.126 --> 16:31.293
And he said,

16:31.294 --> 16:33.195
"It was never a chore.

16:33.196 --> 16:35.297
It was my gift to your mother.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.900
And now that she's gone, I
can still give her this gift.

16:37.901 --> 16:40.335
It keeps her close to me".

16:43.339 --> 16:44.907
I know I'm really hormonal,

16:44.908 --> 16:47.643
but we're all about to
burst into tears, right?

16:48.878 --> 16:50.312
That was beautiful.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.714
Oh, my God.

16:51.715 --> 16:53.882
I'm gonna go home and give Kyle the gift

16:53.883 --> 16:56.185
of actually doing my chores.

16:58.421 --> 17:01.090
(SIGHS) S-So, Jen,

17:01.091 --> 17:02.424
when you do chores for me,

17:02.425 --> 17:04.393
do you consider it a gift?

17:05.762 --> 17:07.496
Guess we'll find out when you're dead.

17:14.521 --> 17:15.746
JOE: There he is,

17:15.747 --> 17:17.448
my favorite flunky.

17:18.842 --> 17:21.844
There he is, my new pinhead boss.

17:21.845 --> 17:23.612
What's up, Joe?

17:23.613 --> 17:25.214
- I got an announcement, okay?
- Okay.

17:25.214 --> 17:27.082
I'm quitting our car business.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.501
Come on. I bust your balls
a little bit yesterday,

17:29.502 --> 17:30.519
now you want to quit?

17:30.520 --> 17:31.854
What are you, a snowflake?

17:31.855 --> 17:34.089
I always knew you were a flake, but...

17:34.090 --> 17:36.625
not a snowflake. Come on.

17:36.626 --> 17:39.061
I'm not quitting because of
your pathetic little jokes,

17:39.062 --> 17:41.296
you egomaniac.

17:41.297 --> 17:43.766
I'm just sick of this boss stuff.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.535
Well, kind of goes with
the satin jacket, Joe.

17:46.536 --> 17:49.204
Look, I don't want to
deal with tax documents

17:49.205 --> 17:52.274
and websites and all
that other crap, okay?

17:52.275 --> 17:54.143
I just want to work on cars.

17:54.144 --> 17:57.146
(SIGHS) Look, you might
not believe this, Baxter,

17:57.147 --> 17:59.815
but I don't... I don't
have a lot of friends.

18:00.884 --> 18:03.218
I'll take your word for it.

18:03.219 --> 18:05.554
I'm just uncomfortable
around people, okay?

18:05.555 --> 18:08.390
When a car's around, somehow,
it-it's easier for me.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.626
It's a-actually fun, you know?

18:10.627 --> 18:13.262
Look, I know that probably
sounds weird to you.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.663
No.

18:14.664 --> 18:16.932
That doesn't sound weird to me.

18:16.933 --> 18:18.500
I mean, being boss just takes

18:18.501 --> 18:20.602
- all the fun out of it.
- Yeah.

18:20.603 --> 18:22.004
That's why I didn't want to do it.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.907
I know Larabee feels the same, too.

18:24.908 --> 18:26.809
So who's gonna be the boss?

18:28.344 --> 18:29.812
Vanessa.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.014
W...

18:32.015 --> 18:33.448
I got an idea.

18:33.449 --> 18:35.450
I got a good idea.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.086
Excuse me for a minute.

18:38.087 --> 18:39.755
- Ed. Ed, listen, um...
- Yeah?

18:39.756 --> 18:41.523
... what do you know about cars?

18:41.524 --> 18:45.294
I know how to buy a
new one when they break.

18:45.295 --> 18:48.130
Okay. I'd like to nominate Ed

18:48.131 --> 18:49.932
to be the boss of our new endeavor.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.667
- Oh. Hell yeah.
- No, no, no.

18:51.668 --> 18:53.101
- That's a great idea.
- No.

18:53.102 --> 18:55.504
No, no, no, no. I don't
know anything about engines.

18:55.505 --> 18:56.805
No, no, no.

18:56.806 --> 18:59.641
You don't have to know
anything about engines.

18:59.642 --> 19:03.612
You said that being a boss is a...

19:03.613 --> 19:05.013
- heady cocktail, right?
- Yeah.

19:05.014 --> 19:07.015
Well, how would you like to be...

19:07.016 --> 19:09.952
our bartender?

19:10.954 --> 19:13.555
- I accept your nomination.
- Ah.

19:13.556 --> 19:16.358
All right. Prepare to be over-served.

19:18.194 --> 19:21.663
Well, all those in favor of Ed
being our new boss say "aye".

19:21.664 --> 19:23.065
- Oh. Aye, man.
- Aye.

19:23.066 --> 19:25.467
- It's unanimous. You're the skipper.
- All right. Good.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.502
- And you're gonna need this.
- ED: Oh.

19:30.006 --> 19:32.741
(LAUGHS) I'm humbled by
your faith in me, gentlemen.

19:32.742 --> 19:34.343
All right, first order of business,

19:34.344 --> 19:36.011
pain in the ass flows one way:

19:36.012 --> 19:37.179
from me to you.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.706
All right? All right.

19:39.707 --> 19:42.050
Now that that's settled, uh,
you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

19:42.051 --> 19:45.053
I'm on my way to create a
new folder on my desktop.

19:45.054 --> 19:46.321
I'm gonna need that back

19:46.322 --> 19:49.057
on Easter and my mom's birthday.

19:49.058 --> 19:51.827
I got some cop buddies to
let us into the impound lot.

19:51.828 --> 19:53.896
Let's go down there
and check out the cars.

19:53.897 --> 19:54.930
- Sounds like fun.
- CHUCK: Mm.

19:54.931 --> 19:56.531
I don't like that impound lot.

19:56.532 --> 19:58.367
They got too many dogs there.

19:58.368 --> 20:00.202
Well, Joe smells like cats.

20:00.203 --> 20:02.205
He goes in first.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.402
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man.

20:11.403 --> 20:14.505
Talking about the
importance of friendship.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.507
Maybe it doesn't come easily for you.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.575
Maybe you're shy or awkward

20:18.576 --> 20:22.513
or you're like me and you
really just don't like people.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.573
Okay, what you need to
do is find common ground

20:25.574 --> 20:27.351
that makes other folks bearable.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.921
FDR and Uncle Joe Stalin
didn't have much to talk about

20:30.922 --> 20:33.322
at the 1945 Yalta Conference.

20:33.323 --> 20:35.324
You see, one of 'em liked martinis.

20:35.325 --> 20:38.727
The other preferred Molotov cocktails.

20:38.728 --> 20:40.729
Until Frankie realized,

20:40.730 --> 20:43.232
"Hey, Joey, you like stealing property.

20:43.233 --> 20:46.335
I like taxes.

20:46.336 --> 20:49.171
We're both commie bastards!"

20:50.574 --> 20:52.908
The New Kids on the Block
had their differences,

20:52.909 --> 20:54.844
but they were always
able to put 'em aside,

20:54.845 --> 20:57.079
come together in a studio and record

20:57.080 --> 21:00.349
some of the worst
songs in music history.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.720
Yeah, we may have more that
divides us than unites us,

21:04.721 --> 21:07.356
but, luckily, it only takes
one thing to draw us together.

21:07.357 --> 21:09.258
Now, I understand... believe me...

21:09.259 --> 21:11.360
how hard it can be
sharing something you love

21:11.361 --> 21:13.596
with someone you don't.

21:13.597 --> 21:17.933
I do it every April 15.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.370
(MOUTHS)

21:23.240 --> 21:26.408
But unlike having your
hard-earned money confiscated,

21:26.409 --> 21:29.645
forging friendships can
actually help you live longer.

21:29.646 --> 21:32.243
And if my motivation is
keeping those bastards

21:32.244 --> 21:33.582
from collecting their death tax,

21:33.583 --> 21:35.389
hell, I might just live forever.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.386
Baxter out.

21:38.979 --> 21:40.637
