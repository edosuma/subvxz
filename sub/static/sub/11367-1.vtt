WEBVTT

00:16.322 --> 00:17.240
And that's how it went.

00:17.241 --> 00:18.992
Everything done by the book.

00:19.034 --> 00:21.036
I see.

00:21.077 --> 00:22.453
Well, you're my last witness

00:22.495 --> 00:27.042
which means that we are
reaching the end of this trial.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.085
And this is when I usually
present my summation

00:29.127 --> 00:34.965
with a smart turn-of-phrase
or a memorable quote,

00:34.966 --> 00:38.678
but all I can say is...

00:38.679 --> 00:40.430
I have no case.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.600
The defense has been air tight,

00:43.642 --> 00:46.812
but let's review the facts.

00:47.354 --> 00:47.813
Not it!

00:47.855 --> 00:48.897
It's not fair!

00:48.898 --> 00:50.690
If you want to be it, you
have to catch me first.

00:50.691 --> 00:52.150
The tree house, it's mine!

00:52.151 --> 00:53.235
You'll never catch me!

00:53.277 --> 00:54.236
No girls allowed!

00:54.278 --> 00:55.780
You never go up here anyway.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.197
That's because it's too high.

00:57.198 --> 00:58.700
It's dangerous.

00:58.741 --> 00:59.826
You children!

00:59.867 --> 01:02.579
You stop this nonsense or
I'm calling your mother!

01:02.620 --> 01:04.538
It's Quinn's fault, Nanny Doris.

01:04.539 --> 01:06.374
He's a maniac.

01:07.959 --> 01:11.087
East Line Cooling testified
that they were blameless

01:11.088 --> 01:13.798
when their system failed last summer,

01:13.840 --> 01:17.970
turning my client's $2
million wine collection

01:18.011 --> 01:20.931
into vinegar.

01:20.973 --> 01:24.851
And, as the vice president testified,

01:24.852 --> 01:31.065
you personally inspected the
wiring the day of the incident.

01:31.066 --> 01:35.820
Finding

01:35.821 --> 01:38.865
the wiring properly installed,

01:38.866 --> 01:45.247
the system running perfectly,
and East Line without fault.

01:45.248 --> 01:47.916
An audible yes or no.

01:47.917 --> 01:51.086
Yes.

01:51.087 --> 01:53.965
One last question.

01:54.007 --> 01:56.301
What color are my shoes?

02:00.180 --> 02:01.515
I'm claiming the treehouse.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.267
A victory for girls everywhere.

02:03.308 --> 02:05.352
Emma, the treehouse is mine.

02:05.394 --> 02:08.770
Sorry, possession is
nine tenths of the law.

02:10.107 --> 02:11.859
NOOOOO!

02:11.901 --> 02:14.444
Emma, are you ok?!

02:14.486 --> 02:15.612
Of course.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.156
Why wouldn't I be?

02:18.574 --> 02:24.705
You... you...
you children are impossible!

02:29.127 --> 02:29.794
Again, sir.

02:29.795 --> 02:31.837
My shoes?

02:31.879 --> 02:33.924
The color.

02:40.305 --> 02:44.184
You didn't check the wiring
as you claimed, you couldn't,

02:44.225 --> 02:46.811
because you're color blind.

02:48.355 --> 02:49.398
I... I...

02:49.440 --> 02:51.692
I rest my case, your honor.

02:51.733 --> 02:56.655
And for the record my shoes are red.

02:56.697 --> 03:00.117
How's everybody doing today?

03:00.159 --> 03:02.661
Hello! And goodbye!

03:02.703 --> 03:04.205
Wha-wh-wait!

03:04.246 --> 03:05.998
What'll I tell their mother?

03:06.040 --> 03:08.209
Not my problem!

03:11.921 --> 03:15.425
What have I told you kids about karma?

03:15.467 --> 03:16.801
Huh?

03:22.682 --> 03:25.768
The jury has returned their
verdict ruling that...

03:31.066 --> 03:32.650
Is there a problem, counselor?

03:32.693 --> 03:33.652
No, your honor.

03:33.694 --> 03:35.237
Sorry.

03:38.031 --> 03:40.742
What is going on in this house?

03:40.743 --> 03:42.411
Well, let's look on the bright side.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.704
The children are getting so creative.

03:44.705 --> 03:46.914
I live by the law.

03:46.915 --> 03:49.085
How do I have such rule-breaking kids?

03:49.127 --> 03:53.006
I suppose they take after
their grandma, don't they?

03:53.047 --> 03:55.299
You said it, not me.

03:56.342 --> 03:58.636
Kids, kitchen. Now.

04:01.389 --> 04:03.850
So what do you have to say for yourselves?

04:03.892 --> 04:05.559
We were just having fun.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.522
Pretending your sister is
seriously injured is fun?

04:08.563 --> 04:09.230
I object, mom.

04:09.272 --> 04:10.231
You're leading the witness.

04:10.232 --> 04:11.900
Emma, legalese is best left in the hands-

04:11.941 --> 04:13.902
In the hands of the professionals.

04:13.943 --> 04:15.820
I know.

04:15.862 --> 04:21.368
This is, um... our fifth
nanny in six months.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.660
What was wrong with nanny Doris?

04:22.661 --> 04:24.412
Wasn't a good fit. Too nervous.

04:24.413 --> 04:25.247
Nanny Amy?

04:25.247 --> 04:25.998
Too serious.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.081
Nanny Margaret?

04:27.082 --> 04:29.126
Driving with her, you took
your life in your hands.

04:29.168 --> 04:33.047
And we know how important
road safety is to you, mom.

04:41.847 --> 04:43.058
Tell me that that...

04:43.099 --> 04:45.518
that isn't a trophy wall?

04:49.105 --> 04:50.941
You mean our art project?

04:52.776 --> 04:54.360
Upstairs, now!

04:54.402 --> 04:56.321
Go on, pajamas.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.741
Early dinner, early to bed.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.076
Why are they doing this?

05:01.117 --> 05:04.037
Well, they got you home early, didn't they?

05:04.079 --> 05:06.456
They're too smart for their own good.

05:06.457 --> 05:09.334
Well, now that they get from you.

05:09.335 --> 05:11.837
I'm just saying, ok look at this wall.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.758
Alright, school, rock
climbing, soccer, violin...

05:16.801 --> 05:19.302
that's just a Monday!

05:19.303 --> 05:21.806
I am trying to raise well-rounded children

05:21.848 --> 05:25.643
that will make good decisions
when they are of age.

05:25.685 --> 05:27.644
And I fully support that.

05:27.645 --> 05:30.147
Are you volunteering your services?

05:31.233 --> 05:33.609
Ok, you know I would love nothing more,

05:33.610 --> 05:37.114
but honestly if I'm not at the
store, nothing gets done.

05:37.155 --> 05:39.908
I know, I know, it's not your job.

05:39.950 --> 05:42.369
We're gonna find a nanny, I promise.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.495
But please.

05:43.536 --> 05:46.749
Please, tomorrow you have
to go to the nanny agency

05:46.790 --> 05:48.959
and try to line someone up for us, ok?

05:49.001 --> 05:50.961
Ok, I will try.

05:51.003 --> 05:52.004
There has to be somebody

05:52.045 --> 05:55.591
who does not know the
legend of Emma and Quinn.

06:21.117 --> 06:23.537
Grandma, they've got Galaxo.

06:23.578 --> 06:25.538
Can we play, please?

06:25.539 --> 06:26.849
Oh, honey, we're just about to eat lunch.

06:26.873 --> 06:28.750
But playing Galaxo will make us hungry.

06:28.792 --> 06:29.543
Really?

06:29.544 --> 06:31.044
Alright.

06:31.045 --> 06:32.129
Ok, there you go.

06:32.171 --> 06:34.380
Share nicely and stay on that machine

06:34.381 --> 06:36.549
so I can see you, ok?

06:40.721 --> 06:41.722
Hi, Cass.

06:41.764 --> 06:44.223
Mom, please tell me the
search is going well.

06:44.224 --> 06:46.561
Oh, alright now don't panic
but I've already talked to

06:46.602 --> 06:49.480
three agencies and so far no takers.

06:49.522 --> 06:50.565
You have to find someone.

06:50.606 --> 06:53.193
This couldn't be happening
at a busier time!

06:53.234 --> 06:54.985
I know, I'm doing my best.

06:55.027 --> 06:56.362
Mom, I'm desperate.

06:56.404 --> 06:57.238
Don't worry, honey.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.824
I'll get creative if I have to, ok?

06:59.865 --> 07:00.575
Thanks.

07:00.616 --> 07:02.702
Ok, bye.

07:02.743 --> 07:04.454
Vivian?

07:04.495 --> 07:05.663
Charles!

07:05.706 --> 07:06.831
Oh!

07:06.832 --> 07:08.959
What a surprise to see you!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.375
Oh, it's been so long.

07:10.376 --> 07:12.546
It has been too long.

07:12.588 --> 07:13.713
You look great.

07:13.714 --> 07:14.673
Ageless and timeless.

07:14.715 --> 07:17.092
Oh, you always were such a good liar.

07:17.843 --> 07:18.719
Nothing but the truth.

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
Oh, you.

07:20.429 --> 07:21.054
May I?

07:21.055 --> 07:22.306
Oh, please, sit down.

07:22.348 --> 07:23.432
Yeah.

07:23.474 --> 07:25.433
Although I must warn you I'm
watching my grandchildren

07:25.434 --> 07:28.687
but I promise they will be
on their best behaviour.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.358
Yeah, who am I kidding?

07:32.399 --> 07:33.818
I don't have that kind of power.

07:35.277 --> 07:37.864
It's alright, I'm expecting
my son, Matthew.

07:37.905 --> 07:38.947
Oh.

07:38.948 --> 07:39.948
I don't have that kind of
power with him, either,

07:39.949 --> 07:41.450
and he's an adult.

07:41.451 --> 07:42.284
So they tell me.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.579
So Matthew Walker's back in town?

07:44.621 --> 07:46.038
Hard to believe, I know.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.250
After nine months of
sailing around the Gulf

07:48.291 --> 07:49.459
of who knows where.

07:49.501 --> 07:52.462
Boy, that guy's been living
the dream, hasn't he?

07:52.504 --> 07:53.213
Uh huh.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.296
He made his internet fortune

07:54.297 --> 07:56.591
so I guess he can do what he wants.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.261
Still, I'd like to see him settle down.

07:59.302 --> 08:01.263
How are you guys getting along?

08:01.304 --> 08:02.347
Same as ever.

08:02.389 --> 08:04.283
He's been back two weeks
and we're already at odds

08:04.307 --> 08:05.142
with each other.

08:05.183 --> 08:08.354
Yeah, this time it's about this marina.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.647
Honestly, I don't know what to do.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.482
I just wish he could commit to something.

08:12.483 --> 08:15.278
I mean, I'm not getting any
younger and neither is he.

08:15.319 --> 08:17.988
It'd be nice to know that my
business would be in good hands,

08:17.989 --> 08:20.116
you know, someday.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.370
You did it, Cass.

08:24.412 --> 08:25.705
This is the big time.

08:25.747 --> 08:30.126
I'm giving you lead chair
on the Haskey case.

08:30.168 --> 08:32.962
Oh, that's... fantastic.

08:33.004 --> 08:35.424
The next few weeks will be intense,

08:35.465 --> 08:37.592
but it's your shot.

08:37.634 --> 08:41.471
You nail this, we're talking partner.

08:41.513 --> 08:42.597
Great.

08:42.639 --> 08:47.101
Oh... what a mess.

08:47.102 --> 08:48.395
You seem a little frazzled.

08:48.437 --> 08:49.188
No, no.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.856
I'm fine.

08:51.857 --> 08:53.483
A lot is on the line here, Cass.

08:53.525 --> 08:54.693
It's not just the case.

08:54.694 --> 08:56.403
Adam Haskey is a big player in this town.

08:56.445 --> 08:59.614
He could be a huge client for us.

08:59.615 --> 09:01.867
Everything is under control.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.661
Thank you.

09:07.707 --> 09:09.959
Children, you never stop
worrying about them, do you?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.543
You certainly don't.

09:11.544 --> 09:15.215
You know, Cass has the opposite problem.

09:15.256 --> 09:18.176
She never takes a moment to
stop and smell the roses.

09:18.218 --> 09:19.885
She's always scheduled,

09:19.886 --> 09:21.721
always something new on her plate.

09:21.722 --> 09:24.223
So she never found anyone
since Elliott passed away?

09:24.224 --> 09:25.476
Uh-uh.

09:25.517 --> 09:27.184
She has no time for romance.

09:27.185 --> 09:29.396
She barely even has time for
her kids and you know what,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.397
those kids really need her.

09:31.398 --> 09:34.151
And right now they don't even have a nanny.

09:37.696 --> 09:39.156
Matthew!

09:39.198 --> 09:41.241
Hey, Woody.

09:41.242 --> 09:43.409
Maybe you can talk to your dad.

09:43.410 --> 09:44.410
Oh, I will.

09:44.411 --> 09:45.662
Don't you worry.

09:45.705 --> 09:48.582
A lot of good people are gonna
lose work if that goes through.

09:48.583 --> 09:52.753
I'll chain myself to a
bulldozer if I have to.

09:52.754 --> 09:53.421
Take care, bud.

09:53.463 --> 09:55.423
You too.

09:56.799 --> 09:58.425
Yep, I guess one needs to grow up

09:58.426 --> 10:03.056
and the other one needs
to live a little, huh?

10:03.098 --> 10:05.017
Oh, there he is.

10:05.058 --> 10:06.018
Emma, it's not fair.

10:06.059 --> 10:07.101
You just went.

10:07.102 --> 10:09.646
Well, I got the high score
and that's how it works.

10:09.687 --> 10:10.814
Woah, woah, woah.

10:10.856 --> 10:12.857
Easy now, I'm sure we can settle this.

10:12.858 --> 10:14.776
Find some peace with honor.

10:14.777 --> 10:15.569
How can I help?

10:15.570 --> 10:16.904
Do you have a quarter?

10:16.945 --> 10:17.780
I'm short.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.697
You certainly are.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.783
You don't just ask strangers for money.

10:20.824 --> 10:21.700
It's alright.

10:21.742 --> 10:23.869
I'm pretty sure I can spare a quarter.

10:23.911 --> 10:26.454
Ah, but... what's your highest score?

10:26.455 --> 10:27.455
600,000.

10:27.456 --> 10:28.416
On Galaxo.

10:28.457 --> 10:29.624
872,000.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.459
Pff. Amateurs.

10:30.459 --> 10:31.419
You know what?

10:31.460 --> 10:32.646
I can crack a million with one eye shut.

10:32.670 --> 10:35.381
Step aside, watch and learn.

10:35.423 --> 10:36.090
Look at him.

10:36.132 --> 10:37.966
He's a natural with those kids.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.343
It takes one to know one, I guess.

10:42.681 --> 10:43.640
Charles?

10:43.640 --> 10:44.473
Hmm?

10:44.516 --> 10:48.143
I think you just gave me the best idea.

10:48.144 --> 10:49.144
Yeah!

10:50.564 --> 10:51.731
Right?

11:02.076 --> 11:03.618
Yes!

11:06.413 --> 11:07.622
You can't move forward with your condos.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.959
It will ruin the marina.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.544
I'm not sure why you care.

11:11.586 --> 11:13.504
You're never around long
enough to enjoy it.

11:13.546 --> 11:14.046
Oh, great.

11:14.088 --> 11:15.047
Here we go.

11:15.089 --> 11:17.925
Maybe there could be a
reason to stick around.

11:19.176 --> 11:20.303
You could be Cass's nanny.

11:20.345 --> 11:23.264
Me? As Cass's nanny?

11:23.306 --> 11:24.348
You gotta be joking.

11:24.349 --> 11:25.475
Actually, I'm not.

11:25.516 --> 11:26.977
She never even liked me.

11:27.018 --> 11:28.728
Yes, she did.

11:28.769 --> 11:30.271
But she really does need the help.

11:30.313 --> 11:31.231
She's desperate.

11:31.272 --> 11:33.817
I'm sorry Cass is Ina rough spot, but me?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.252
I really don't think I'm the right guy.

11:35.276 --> 11:36.903
I don't even know these kids.

11:36.945 --> 11:38.238
Well, actually you do.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.197
They already like you.

11:40.198 --> 11:42.867
And you'd just be helping out a friend.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.620
You help Cass

11:44.661 --> 11:48.706
and show me that you can commit
to something here in town

11:48.707 --> 11:53.254
and I'll reconsider the
marina development project.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.799
Are you serious?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.217
Do I ever joke about business?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.844
You do not.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.054
You do this for Cass

12:03.055 --> 12:05.056
and I'll make sure

12:05.057 --> 12:08.478
that whatever your friends
hold dear about this marina

12:08.520 --> 12:12.189
will be under your control.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.278
It's up to you, son.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.415
Alright.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.083
Wee!

12:30.125 --> 12:30.751
Oooh.

12:30.752 --> 12:32.628
Mom, it's ok.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.296
We can just have cereal.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.174
I don't mind floor pancakes.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.301
Goody-goody.

12:39.302 --> 12:41.511
Oh, that must be our nanny candidate.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.222
My prayers have been answered.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.515
Mom, get down here.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.936
Nanny candidate's at the door.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.063
You two behave.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.578
Hey, Cass.

13:04.619 --> 13:07.121
Matthew?

13:07.164 --> 13:08.623
Matthew Walker.

13:08.665 --> 13:09.374
Yeah.

13:09.416 --> 13:10.709
It's been a while.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.128
You look... great.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.297
Oh, thank you.

13:15.339 --> 13:19.634
Um, so do you.

13:19.677 --> 13:21.428
Come in.

13:23.472 --> 13:25.640
Wow, nice place.

13:25.641 --> 13:28.436
Yeah, it's not too shabby.

13:28.478 --> 13:32.064
Gosh, I haven't seen you for ages.

13:33.983 --> 13:35.984
Hey, guys.

13:35.985 --> 13:38.529
I'm sorry, you've caught me in
the middle of a mad morning.

13:38.571 --> 13:41.824
Um, to what do I owe the pleasure?

13:41.867 --> 13:43.493
Your mother didn't tell you?

13:43.534 --> 13:44.452
My mother?

13:44.494 --> 13:45.036
Yeah.

13:45.078 --> 13:46.161
Oh, hey!

13:46.162 --> 13:49.832
Oh, how great to see you two
in the same room again.

13:49.833 --> 13:50.709
Hi.

13:50.710 --> 13:53.669
So, did Matthew tell you about his app?

13:53.670 --> 13:55.630
It's been going so well
this guy's been sailing

13:55.631 --> 13:56.840
all over the world.

13:56.882 --> 14:00.676
Oh, how wonderful for you.

14:00.677 --> 14:02.471
You know-I think

14:02.513 --> 14:04.014
He's really remarkable.

14:04.015 --> 14:07.683
Stanford Law grad, fluent
in three languages,

14:07.684 --> 14:11.272
and the kids are crazy about him.

14:12.982 --> 14:13.775
Oy!

14:13.816 --> 14:15.652
Are you kidding?!

14:15.693 --> 14:19.029
Please behave!

14:19.030 --> 14:20.114
What's going on here?

14:20.156 --> 14:22.366
Your mom said you need
someone to watch the kids

14:22.367 --> 14:23.743
and help out a little.

14:25.787 --> 14:29.040
You're the nanny candidate.

14:29.082 --> 14:30.375
Oh, mom.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.460
In the kitchen, now.

14:32.502 --> 14:34.545
Be right back.

14:34.546 --> 14:35.547
Ok.

14:36.506 --> 14:38.216
Just-don't go away.

14:41.887 --> 14:43.847
What in heaven's name?!

14:43.889 --> 14:45.347
Well, honey, I am sorry.

14:45.348 --> 14:46.892
I looked everywhere.

14:46.934 --> 14:52.105
Trust me, there is literally no
one else who will do this job.

14:52.147 --> 14:54.899
You don't have a lot of options, sweetie.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.568
Mom, this is ridiculous!

14:59.155 --> 15:00.239
Is this your dad?

15:00.281 --> 15:01.907
Yeah.

15:01.908 --> 15:02.783
He died.

15:02.784 --> 15:05.912
Didn't know him, but we hear stories.

15:08.331 --> 15:09.874
Nice catch.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.377
Sweetie, you've got no choice.

15:13.420 --> 15:15.339
And Matthew's game!

15:15.380 --> 15:16.423
You know him!

15:16.465 --> 15:18.257
You know his family.

15:18.258 --> 15:19.301
And besides,

15:19.343 --> 15:21.594
it's way better than having
a stranger in the house.

15:21.595 --> 15:22.595
Just sayin'.

15:22.596 --> 15:25.015
I'm not having a man take
care of my children.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.059
Especially one who could
drop everything on a whim

15:27.101 --> 15:28.393
and just shove off to sea!

15:28.435 --> 15:30.729
The answer is no, absolutely not.

15:30.771 --> 15:31.814
No.

15:38.195 --> 15:39.238
I am so sorry.

15:39.279 --> 15:42.281
This whole thing has been
a big misunderstanding.

15:42.282 --> 15:44.118
No problem.

15:44.159 --> 15:45.744
I'll just shove off then.

15:45.745 --> 15:49.207
Oh, I-I didn't-mean
that the way it sounded.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.917
It was good to see you again, Cass.

15:57.883 --> 15:59.467
Bye.

16:00.844 --> 16:02.637
There. You happy now?

16:02.638 --> 16:05.015
No. Are you?

16:09.603 --> 16:11.646
Well, it's a classic backstab

16:11.647 --> 16:13.857
from my "buddy" from high school-

16:13.899 --> 16:17.319
Who created his new company using old code

16:17.361 --> 16:21.573
that you wrote together, 12 years ago.

16:23.159 --> 16:24.492
Ah, our superstar.

16:24.493 --> 16:26.161
I'm just the wallpaper around here.

16:26.162 --> 16:29.831
No one plays high-stakes
poker better than Cass.

16:29.832 --> 16:31.709
Good. Great.

16:31.751 --> 16:33.334
I will warn you, though.

16:33.335 --> 16:34.211
Benji's slippery.

16:34.253 --> 16:35.648
Everything that we invented together

16:35.672 --> 16:36.881
he later claimed as his idea.

16:36.923 --> 16:40.718
He's a world class... liar.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.555
I specialize in exposing the truth.

16:43.596 --> 16:45.014
When Cass is done with this guy

16:45.015 --> 16:48.894
he will fold like a deck
chair on the Titanic.

16:48.936 --> 16:49.895
Benji deserves it.

16:49.896 --> 16:53.815
I will warn you too that
I am intense, alright?

16:53.816 --> 16:54.650
I have to win this.

16:54.651 --> 16:56.193
Nay, I will win this.

16:56.234 --> 16:57.944
You have our entire focus, Adam.

16:57.945 --> 17:00.530
Feel free to call Cass 24/7.

17:00.531 --> 17:01.407
Oh yeah?

17:01.449 --> 17:02.699
24... 7.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.367
That's right.

17:04.367 --> 17:07.204
Let's walk him through our plan in detail.

17:07.204 --> 17:07.829
Now?

17:07.871 --> 17:08.997
No time like the present.

17:09.039 --> 17:10.059
We caught a break from the judge

17:10.083 --> 17:11.459
and he moved up our date.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.087
We head to court in four weeks.

17:14.127 --> 17:17.131
That's um... so soon.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.928
Do we have a problem with that?

17:21.970 --> 17:22.887
No, no, no.

17:22.887 --> 17:23.847
Not at all.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.056
Ok.

17:25.098 --> 17:29.561
Cass, don't worry, I'm therefor
you every step of the way.

17:29.603 --> 17:31.395
So that's 250?

17:31.396 --> 17:32.396
Yeah.

17:32.981 --> 17:34.566
I just met Adam Haskey.

17:34.608 --> 17:36.985
Who knew tech billionaires
could be so cute?

17:37.027 --> 17:39.363
Not my type.

17:41.323 --> 17:42.907
What is your type?

17:42.908 --> 17:46.745
Times New Roman.

17:46.746 --> 17:47.788
Is there something else?

17:47.830 --> 17:50.081
Yes, you told me to remind
you when it's 4:00.

17:50.082 --> 17:51.792
Time to pick the kids up from school.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.002
It's 4:00 already?

17:53.043 --> 17:54.294
Woah, woah, woah.

17:54.336 --> 17:58.757
You-you have to go now?

17:58.758 --> 18:00.760
Just give me two minutes.

18:00.801 --> 18:01.927
Hello?

18:01.969 --> 18:03.864
Mom, I need you to go and
pick up the kids right now,

18:03.888 --> 18:05.806
I cannot make it to school.

18:05.848 --> 18:06.724
Just breathe, honey.

18:06.766 --> 18:08.517
I'll get someone to cover me.

18:08.518 --> 18:09.895
Of course I'll pick up the kids.

18:09.936 --> 18:11.271
But we can't keep doing this.

18:11.312 --> 18:15.859
And we do have a solution,
Matthew, is the answer.

18:29.081 --> 18:31.917
Matthew?

18:31.958 --> 18:35.628
Matthew, are you... home?

18:35.629 --> 18:37.297
Hello.

18:37.298 --> 18:38.465
Hi.

18:38.507 --> 18:40.634
Cass, hey.

18:40.677 --> 18:42.929
Uh, I wasn't expecting you.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.346
Hi.

18:44.388 --> 18:46.599
I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.

18:46.641 --> 18:48.481
You know, my mother really
caught me off-guard.

18:48.518 --> 18:51.438
She likes to throw those curve balls.

18:51.479 --> 18:53.856
And um... I know that you heard some things

18:53.898 --> 18:57.318
that probably didn't come out quite right.

18:57.319 --> 18:59.279
Is that right?

18:59.321 --> 19:00.155
Yes.

19:00.156 --> 19:04.076
Um... I-I didn't mean to offend you.

19:04.117 --> 19:05.828
What are you doing?

19:07.913 --> 19:09.623
Oh, I just had to document that moment.

19:09.665 --> 19:12.710
I mean, in high school we would
have killed for evidence

19:12.751 --> 19:16.213
of adult you admitting you were wrong.

19:16.254 --> 19:18.048
That is so grown up of you.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.883
I'm just kidding.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.885
Is this a joke to you?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.346
Because it's not to me.

19:23.387 --> 19:24.971
I have two children, I have a career,

19:24.972 --> 19:26.014
I have responsibilities

19:26.015 --> 19:27.765
and I am barely keeping
my head above water.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.685
So what you're saying is...

19:30.686 --> 19:32.480
you need my help.

19:32.521 --> 19:34.565
Just for a short time.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.442
Until I find a proper nanny.

19:36.484 --> 19:38.861
Fair enough.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.614
Why do you want this job?

19:40.655 --> 19:42.531
Your mom said you needed a hand

19:42.532 --> 19:46.077
and I'd just like to help you out.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.704
Ok, it was either your kids

19:47.746 --> 19:50.706
or my father lecture me every day.

19:50.707 --> 19:51.958
They never stop, do they?

19:52.001 --> 19:55.211
No, they don't.

19:55.212 --> 19:56.255
Great.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.382
I'll um... see you first
thing tomorrow morning.

19:59.383 --> 20:01.218
First thing.

20:28.079 --> 20:30.331
Why am I not surprised?

20:34.961 --> 20:37.047
Great car.

20:37.088 --> 20:38.840
She is a classic, right?

20:38.882 --> 20:40.008
She sure is.

20:40.050 --> 20:44.262
And no child of mine will be
riding in that death trap.

20:44.263 --> 20:46.098
Your new hot rod.

20:46.140 --> 20:51.437
Seven seats, extra room for
groceries and air bags.

20:51.478 --> 20:53.104
What else does a man need?

20:53.105 --> 20:55.106
You mean Manny?

20:55.107 --> 20:57.275
Uh, no. I don't.

20:58.277 --> 21:00.405
Come in.

21:00.447 --> 21:03.031
The weekly agenda, broken down by day.

21:03.032 --> 21:05.284
Love it, learn it, stick to it.

21:05.285 --> 21:06.285
Wow.

21:06.286 --> 21:08.620
It's like you're running
the UN General Assembly.

21:08.621 --> 21:10.665
Thank you.

21:10.707 --> 21:13.710
And also, does Tuesday
always come before Monday

21:13.751 --> 21:14.877
in this house?

21:14.878 --> 21:18.589
Ooh, heads are going to roll.

21:18.590 --> 21:20.425
Oh, no. I'll get that.

21:24.638 --> 21:26.223
Yellow are activities,

21:26.264 --> 21:29.059
lime are meals and white is downtime.

21:29.101 --> 21:30.935
I don't see too many whites.

21:30.936 --> 21:33.313
Ooh, the telephone.

21:33.314 --> 21:35.732
Uh, this is synced to an online calendar

21:35.733 --> 21:37.235
so you're gonna get alerts.

21:37.276 --> 21:42.031
It plays a chime, buzzer,
and taps if you're late.

21:43.657 --> 21:44.951
Any questions?

21:44.993 --> 21:46.785
Uh, just one.

21:46.786 --> 21:48.579
Does it come in black?

21:48.622 --> 21:50.414
No.

21:51.583 --> 21:52.833
Ok, sergeant.

21:52.834 --> 21:53.668
What's next?

21:53.669 --> 21:55.462
Follow me.

21:58.673 --> 22:01.800
And these are your accommodations.

22:01.801 --> 22:03.887
Make yourself at home.

22:06.806 --> 22:07.807
Oh, I love it.

22:07.849 --> 22:09.143
Yeah.

22:09.184 --> 22:11.979
But um, where's Snow White gonna stay?

22:12.021 --> 22:14.523
I'll let you get settled.

22:20.488 --> 22:22.156
Nice try, guys!

22:22.197 --> 22:23.533
But you missed.

22:28.538 --> 22:30.123
Well played.

22:30.165 --> 22:32.167
Well played!

22:40.384 --> 22:41.677
Hey there.

22:41.718 --> 22:43.510
Hey. You all moved in?

22:43.511 --> 22:46.932
Uh, yep. I travel light.

22:46.973 --> 22:50.060
What's that?

22:50.101 --> 22:54.273
That's Emma practicing her violin.

22:54.315 --> 22:56.317
She's relentless.

22:56.358 --> 22:57.400
Wonder where she gets that.

22:57.401 --> 22:58.401
Excuse me?

22:58.402 --> 22:59.736
Hmm? Nothing.

22:59.778 --> 23:00.779
I'll just uh...

23:00.821 --> 23:02.156
Oh, you know, while you're here,

23:02.198 --> 23:06.243
would you mind getting the kids'
lunches started for tomorrow?

23:06.285 --> 23:09.245
It's best to do it the night before.

23:09.246 --> 23:10.206
Lunches, check.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.666
Not that simple.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.793
Let me show you.

23:15.378 --> 23:19.298
We keep a clean, organic,
farm-to-table house.

23:19.299 --> 23:22.050
Proteins are free-range and grass-fed.

23:22.051 --> 23:23.636
Only natural sugars.

23:26.723 --> 23:29.100
Mostly fruits.

23:29.101 --> 23:29.893
Mmm.

23:29.893 --> 23:30.853
Nutrition's a given.

23:30.854 --> 23:33.270
But it can't come at the expense

23:33.271 --> 23:36.440
of their basic relationship to food.

23:36.441 --> 23:41.738
You mean eating?

23:41.739 --> 23:42.947
I'll get you started.

23:42.948 --> 23:44.116
No, it's ok.

23:44.157 --> 23:47.911
I've kept myself alive on a
boat for months at a time.

23:47.953 --> 23:50.788
I think I can handle a bag lunch.

23:50.789 --> 23:54.292
Ok. I guess we'll see.

23:54.293 --> 23:56.045
Guess we will.

24:15.565 --> 24:16.150
Good morning.

24:16.191 --> 24:17.316
Morning.

24:17.317 --> 24:18.360
The coffee's brewing,

24:18.402 --> 24:20.404
breakfast is on and lunches
are in the pantry.

24:20.445 --> 24:24.033
Everyone is going to be a happy camper.

24:25.993 --> 24:27.536
What lunches?

24:27.577 --> 24:29.580
What?

24:30.831 --> 24:31.873
Where did they go?

24:31.874 --> 24:33.959
Because they were waiting
right here on the shelf.

24:34.001 --> 24:36.462
Anybody care to explain?

24:39.799 --> 24:43.594
Here's $10. Buy lunch.

24:43.636 --> 24:45.095
They won round one.

24:45.096 --> 24:47.265
Don't you two do that again.

24:47.307 --> 24:47.891
Ok, I gotta go.

24:47.933 --> 24:49.684
I love you guys.

24:52.187 --> 24:53.980
Are you gonna be alright?

24:54.022 --> 24:55.189
Go. Defend the good guys.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.901
Please do not let them be late to school.

24:57.943 --> 24:59.445
Je t'aime plus Que Le monde.

24:59.486 --> 25:00.904
Je t'aime brasse.

25:02.531 --> 25:04.950
My little cherubs.

25:27.890 --> 25:28.725
Alright.

25:28.766 --> 25:30.118
We need to go over a few ground rules.

25:30.142 --> 25:31.227
I am not your normal nanny

25:31.269 --> 25:33.771
and your usual tricks
aren't gonna work on me.

25:33.813 --> 25:34.439
What tricks?

25:34.481 --> 25:35.064
We weren't-

25:35.064 --> 25:35.815
Da-da-da.

25:35.816 --> 25:37.317
Just remember: if you annoy me,

25:37.359 --> 25:38.650
I'm gonna leave and then you'll be stuck

25:38.651 --> 25:40.278
with someone boring again, ok?

25:40.320 --> 25:43.531
So if you want this
arrangement to continue,

25:43.573 --> 25:45.074
get with the program.

25:45.075 --> 25:46.575
Are we clear?

25:46.576 --> 25:47.911
We're clear.

25:47.953 --> 25:50.956
Great.

25:50.998 --> 25:53.082
Where's your school again?

25:53.083 --> 25:56.252
I just programmed it into the GPS.

25:56.253 --> 25:57.921
Ok.

25:57.963 --> 25:59.923
I'm liking this truce already, guys.

25:59.965 --> 26:01.258
Teamwork.

26:01.259 --> 26:05.845
So, you guys think we should
sing, or listen to the radio?

26:05.846 --> 26:07.764
Take the next right.

26:07.765 --> 26:09.809
Row, row, row your boat

26:09.851 --> 26:11.978
gently down the stream...

26:12.020 --> 26:13.146
How old do you think we are?

26:13.187 --> 26:14.437
This is so lame.

26:14.438 --> 26:15.940
It's painful.

26:17.692 --> 26:21.195
You have arrived at your destination.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.034
Hilarious.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.931
Oh, and uh... I'll be
watching you both walk inside

26:46.972 --> 26:49.140
so no funny business.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.477
I don't need school, I'm going
to be a famous violinist

26:51.519 --> 26:54.439
and study in Paris when I grow up.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.647
Oh, that's cool.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.734
But we live in the here and now so get out.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.158
Go!

27:05.200 --> 27:08.829
I was gonna say you're nice, but forget it!

27:19.631 --> 27:22.551
I can stay late if you wanna get
a jump on the Haskey files,

27:22.593 --> 27:23.676
maybe we could order in.

27:23.677 --> 27:24.720
I can't tonight.

27:24.761 --> 27:26.531
The kids have a new nanny
and I have to make sure

27:26.555 --> 27:28.265
the house hasn't burned to the ground.

27:28.307 --> 27:30.351
Ok, well there's a lot to do.

27:30.392 --> 27:32.143
What about-do you have a home office?

27:32.144 --> 27:35.356
We could do it there.

27:35.397 --> 27:37.567
You're right.

27:37.609 --> 27:40.026
Two birds with one stone.

27:40.027 --> 27:41.571
Done.

27:49.621 --> 27:52.124
See, now this is my idea of fun.

27:52.165 --> 27:53.624
Or torture.

27:53.625 --> 27:55.502
What, you don't like climbing?

27:57.504 --> 27:59.297
You guys are really late.

27:59.339 --> 28:01.716
Red team, hustle on the
line for a warm-up climb.

28:01.717 --> 28:03.317
Blue team, you're on the little boulder.

28:04.469 --> 28:05.220
Let's go!

28:05.220 --> 28:05.721
Be cool.

28:05.763 --> 28:07.889
Don't embarrass us.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.475
Yeah.

28:11.435 --> 28:15.021
Hey, so uh... you know I
free climbed Denali once.

28:15.022 --> 28:16.190
If you need any help...

28:16.232 --> 28:17.399
Sir, if you could please
wait in the viewing section

28:17.400 --> 28:19.610
with the other parents...

28:19.652 --> 28:21.069
Oh, no, I'm not their parent.

28:21.070 --> 28:27.576
I'm their male... supervision expert...

28:27.618 --> 28:28.870
Ok...

28:32.248 --> 28:36.377
Just over... there?

28:36.378 --> 28:38.129
Yeah, good job Emma!

28:38.171 --> 28:38.588
Whoo!

28:38.630 --> 28:40.674
Monkey it up!

28:40.715 --> 28:41.715
You are a natural!

28:41.716 --> 28:43.426
Hey kid, go for gold!

28:43.427 --> 28:44.761
That's right!

28:44.803 --> 28:45.470
Whew!

28:45.512 --> 28:46.972
Spiderman got nothing on you!

28:47.014 --> 28:47.806
You know?

28:47.847 --> 28:49.075
Emma McKay, ladies and gentlemen.

28:49.099 --> 28:50.559
Whoo!

28:52.602 --> 28:54.229
Yeah!

28:58.442 --> 28:59.026
Come on, Quinn.

28:59.068 --> 28:59.985
You can do it.

29:00.027 --> 29:01.779
I'm trying.

29:01.821 --> 29:03.197
Let's go down.

29:06.909 --> 29:07.952
There you go.

29:07.993 --> 29:09.787
Take a minute?

29:16.502 --> 29:18.087
Hey, bud.

29:18.088 --> 29:19.422
What's the problem?

29:19.464 --> 29:20.966
Nothing.

29:21.007 --> 29:22.634
Doesn't look like nothing.

29:22.676 --> 29:24.928
You know, even pros have off days.

29:24.970 --> 29:26.804
I'm not having an off day.

29:26.805 --> 29:28.432
It's just...

29:28.474 --> 29:29.516
I'm not good.

29:29.558 --> 29:31.435
That's why you're taking lessons.

29:31.477 --> 29:32.603
Forget it.

29:32.644 --> 29:35.397
I just want to go home.

29:35.439 --> 29:36.315
Quinn, buddy.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.234
Come on.

29:38.275 --> 29:40.319
Great job, rookie.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.318
Woah, that was fast.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.695
All in a day's work.

30:22.696 --> 30:25.574
I don't think my mom's gonna
consider this an improvement.

30:25.616 --> 30:26.575
It's blocking the view.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.786
She likes everything in it's proper place.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.037
Oh, I know.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.290
I've seen the board.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.374
Wanna give it a go?

30:33.416 --> 30:34.707
No thanks.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.837
"Home made climbing wall"
is not on the schedule.

30:37.879 --> 30:38.880
I have to go practice.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.215
Hey, I heard you playing the other night.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.134
You are quite the musician.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.178
Do you play in a band or an orchestra?

30:45.219 --> 30:47.514
I prefer being a soloist.

30:47.556 --> 30:48.390
Oh yeah? Why is that?

30:48.432 --> 30:50.975
Because other people make mistakes.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.227
Wow.

30:52.269 --> 30:54.521
You really are a chip off the old mom.

30:54.563 --> 30:55.647
Huh.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.292
Look, you guys need to be
open to new possibilities.

30:57.316 --> 30:58.192
Have a little fun!

30:58.193 --> 31:00.735
Torturing you is fun.

31:02.988 --> 31:05.239
What are you doing?!

31:05.240 --> 31:05.991
Good luck.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.492
Nice knowing you.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.079
What is this eyesore?

31:11.080 --> 31:13.541
I just built a little
climbing run for Quinn.

31:13.583 --> 31:16.210
And you're welcome.

31:16.251 --> 31:19.380
You built a ten-foot... fourteen-foot wall

31:19.422 --> 31:21.340
in the middle of my lawn.

31:21.341 --> 31:23.384
This is a harmonized landscape.

31:23.426 --> 31:24.927
Get that thing down immediately.

31:24.969 --> 31:28.181
Look, your son needs help.

31:28.223 --> 31:30.350
What are you talking about?

31:30.391 --> 31:31.267
He hates climbing,

31:31.309 --> 31:33.186
and it's obvious that he's afraid of it.

31:33.228 --> 31:37.649
This "eyesore" is gonna
help build his confidence.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.611
Fine.

31:41.612 --> 31:43.780
Can you just make sure it
can come down as easily

31:43.822 --> 31:46.700
as it's gone up?

31:48.785 --> 31:50.246
Will do.

32:03.593 --> 32:04.135
Hey.

32:04.136 --> 32:05.678
Come on in.

32:07.138 --> 32:08.264
Sorry, I um...

32:08.305 --> 32:10.140
I thought this was uh...

32:10.141 --> 32:10.933
Oh, no, no.

32:10.975 --> 32:11.975
You're here for Cass?

32:11.976 --> 32:13.185
I'm Matthew.

32:13.228 --> 32:15.146
Our Manny.

32:15.147 --> 32:17.939
I prefer "professional helper man".

32:17.940 --> 32:22.779
Hey, Henry, I have everything
set up here in the office.

32:22.820 --> 32:23.738
How's dinner coming along?

32:23.780 --> 32:26.657
I just started, so... great.

32:26.658 --> 32:28.326
Ok.

32:29.870 --> 32:31.371
Yeah.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.332
Come on.

32:36.794 --> 32:38.002
Who wants to play a game?

32:38.003 --> 32:38.671
Huh?

32:38.672 --> 32:40.256
Eye Spy?

32:40.298 --> 32:41.632
Or Once Upon a Time?

32:41.674 --> 32:43.341
We're not six years old.

32:43.342 --> 32:44.676
Those are baby games.

32:44.677 --> 32:45.843
What?

32:45.844 --> 32:48.681
Once Upon a Time is a
contest of lyrical prowess.

32:48.722 --> 32:51.142
I mean, how do you think
Jay-Z got his start?

32:51.184 --> 32:52.350
No. No.

32:52.351 --> 32:53.311
No.

32:53.352 --> 32:54.937
Listen, I have swapped verse with wise men

32:54.938 --> 32:57.565
from Singapore to San Francisco.

32:57.566 --> 32:59.150
Once upon a time there was a Manny

32:59.192 --> 33:02.612
who dropped pizza crumbs
into every nook and cranny.

33:02.654 --> 33:04.196
He knew he would be fine though,

33:04.197 --> 33:05.531
because he had a broom,

33:05.532 --> 33:10.370
and two kids to help him or
they'd get sent to their room.

33:10.412 --> 33:11.913
You better move fast though,

33:11.955 --> 33:15.167
because mom's coming soon.

33:15.209 --> 33:16.293
I'll allow it.

33:16.335 --> 33:19.545
Now, the first one who messes
up the rhyme is out, ok?

33:19.546 --> 33:20.214
Once up-

33:20.255 --> 33:23.008
Did a bomb go off in here?

33:23.050 --> 33:25.260
What happened to my Asian chicken tostadas?

33:25.302 --> 33:26.846
Uh, yeah.

33:26.887 --> 33:28.473
They didn't happen.

33:28.514 --> 33:32.268
But there's plenty of pizza
if you're staying, Henry.

33:32.310 --> 33:36.062
No, um, thank you, Matthew.

33:36.063 --> 33:37.541
Look, why don't we just
finish up the review

33:37.565 --> 33:38.732
at the office in the morning?

33:38.733 --> 33:41.361
That's a good idea. Thank you.

33:41.402 --> 33:43.154
You're welcome.

33:44.781 --> 33:46.825
Pizza? Seriously?

33:46.867 --> 33:49.409
That is not on my approved list of foods.

33:49.410 --> 33:52.580
The crust is gluten free if you wanna try.

33:52.581 --> 33:54.875
Hey mom, we're playing Once Upon a Time.

33:54.916 --> 33:55.584
Join us.

33:55.585 --> 33:56.835
I don't think I know that one.

33:56.877 --> 33:59.587
You do rhymes until someone messes up.

33:59.588 --> 34:01.382
I'll show you.

34:01.423 --> 34:03.758
Once upon a time there was a dog,

34:03.759 --> 34:06.137
who never just walked when he could jog.

34:09.431 --> 34:11.016
Now it's your turn.

34:16.438 --> 34:17.313
Ok.

34:17.356 --> 34:23.029
He was a cute dog, but he needed a trim.

34:23.070 --> 34:27.616
A sensible schedule was hard for him.

34:27.617 --> 34:28.743
Hmm.

34:28.784 --> 34:31.621
Well, the dog was just
trying to please his master,

34:31.663 --> 34:34.791
who always said "do it
cleaner, and faster!"

34:44.342 --> 34:48.054
Oh, lord. This client never stops.

34:48.096 --> 34:48.722
Huh.

34:48.764 --> 34:49.783
Sounds like someone I know.

34:49.806 --> 34:52.309
Send already.

34:52.310 --> 34:53.686
Send!

34:53.726 --> 34:56.313
Hey, was it always like this?

34:56.355 --> 35:01.069
You know, before their dad uh...

35:01.110 --> 35:03.112
You can say "died".

35:03.154 --> 35:06.239
And his name was Elliott.

35:06.240 --> 35:10.036
No, it wasn't always like this.

35:10.078 --> 35:13.497
I actually had someone I could lean on.

35:13.498 --> 35:15.375
Was it hard on the kids?

35:15.417 --> 35:17.918
You know, they were so young

35:17.919 --> 35:19.670
they really don't remember,

35:19.671 --> 35:22.340
but as Emma gets older she uh...

35:22.341 --> 35:26.095
she asks more and more.

35:26.136 --> 35:30.515
All they really need is you.

35:30.557 --> 35:32.893
I'm trying to fill the void.

35:32.935 --> 35:36.521
I want them to have everything.

35:36.563 --> 35:38.148
And what about you?

35:38.190 --> 35:40.693
What do you get to have?

35:40.735 --> 35:45.947
I don't follow.

35:45.948 --> 35:48.618
Can I get you a glass of wine?

35:53.999 --> 35:55.541
I am exhausted.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.168
I have to go to bed.

35:57.210 --> 35:59.211
I understand.

35:59.212 --> 36:01.840
But you help yourself.

36:01.882 --> 36:03.049
Goodnight.

36:03.091 --> 36:05.426
Goodnight.

36:05.468 --> 36:07.720
Oh, do you know the schedule for tomorrow?

36:07.721 --> 36:09.765
Uh, no.

36:09.806 --> 36:11.850
But I'll stick to it.

36:34.666 --> 36:36.000
Good job.

36:46.178 --> 36:48.721
So let me get this straight.

36:48.763 --> 36:51.099
You play in a padded cell for an hour?

36:51.141 --> 36:53.351
It's not a cell, it's a practice room.

36:53.393 --> 36:54.519
Tomato, tomato.

36:54.561 --> 36:55.979
But check this out.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.272
Talent show.

36:57.314 --> 36:59.900
You might make some friends.

36:59.942 --> 37:01.443
Friends are human beings

37:01.444 --> 37:03.611
who you share a common bond with and-

37:03.612 --> 37:04.572
Ha ha.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.007
There's no way I'm entering a talent show.

37:06.031 --> 37:09.493
Because you might make a mistake on stage?

37:09.535 --> 37:11.619
It's good to put yourself out there.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.371
Ok, listen.

37:12.413 --> 37:13.621
When I was a kid-

37:13.622 --> 37:16.042
What is it gonna take to get to
the end of this conversation?

37:16.084 --> 37:17.043
A simple "yes".

37:17.044 --> 37:20.755
How about a definite "maybe"?

37:20.797 --> 37:22.631
Ok, fine. I'll do it.

37:22.632 --> 37:23.132
Better.

37:23.133 --> 37:24.759
Alright, let's go.

37:29.473 --> 37:31.683
Well Benji, I see that your
manners haven't improved

37:31.725 --> 37:33.227
over the last ten years,

37:33.268 --> 37:36.479
along with your views on
intellectual property.

37:36.480 --> 37:40.192
Mr. Shepherd, did you use
my client's old code

37:40.234 --> 37:41.775
for your new start-up?

37:41.776 --> 37:43.195
Programming is an art.

37:43.237 --> 37:45.321
You borrow from the masters.

37:45.322 --> 37:46.948
Like how Adam's last two products,

37:46.949 --> 37:48.241
they borrow from me.

37:48.242 --> 37:50.202
That's rich. That's really rich.

37:50.244 --> 37:51.953
Gentlemen, let's just stay on point.

37:51.954 --> 37:55.832
Great ideas are all around us,
just floating in the air.

37:55.833 --> 37:57.334
You own the air, Adam?

37:57.335 --> 38:00.421
Just the air that you breathed
when we worked together, buddy.

38:00.463 --> 38:02.340
You want half of everything?

38:04.342 --> 38:07.011
Here.

38:07.012 --> 38:08.304
I have nothing to hide.

38:08.346 --> 38:10.723
If you have nothing to hide
then why have you and your team

38:10.765 --> 38:14.310
not responded to our request for discovery?

38:16.605 --> 38:18.148
You want documents?

38:18.189 --> 38:18.857
Mmmhmm.

38:18.858 --> 38:20.651
You got 'em.

38:21.359 --> 38:22.318
Oh, hey guys.

38:22.361 --> 38:23.654
Mom's building a fort.

38:23.695 --> 38:25.614
Oh, Henry.

38:25.656 --> 38:26.197
Ah, ah, ah.

38:26.198 --> 38:27.365
Guys, don't touch.

38:27.366 --> 38:29.200
And hello, did you have a great day?

38:29.201 --> 38:29.743
Yeah.

38:29.785 --> 38:30.661
It was ok.

38:30.702 --> 38:31.703
Great!

38:31.745 --> 38:33.704
Love you both.

38:33.705 --> 38:35.749
Outside and play.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.876
So, what is all this?

38:37.877 --> 38:41.255
Uh, the plaintiff's trying
to bury us in paperwork.

38:41.297 --> 38:44.050
Photos, bank statements...

38:44.091 --> 38:45.217
you name it, it's in here.

38:45.259 --> 38:48.304
The only thing missing are his baby teeth.

38:48.345 --> 38:49.221
Well, I could help.

38:49.263 --> 38:50.514
I know a thing or two about the law.

38:50.515 --> 38:54.101
You know, sometimes a little
knowledge can be dangerous.

38:54.143 --> 38:56.228
I finished Stanford Law.

38:56.229 --> 38:58.398
I was smart enough not to become a lawyer.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.901
Well, aren't you the most
decorated Manny on the block?

39:01.902 --> 39:03.236
Ha!

39:05.572 --> 39:09.575
Please don't touch that.

39:09.576 --> 39:12.537
I hope you're ok with
taking orders all day.

39:12.538 --> 39:17.876
Actually, um... you know,
Cass and I make a great team.

39:17.918 --> 39:20.253
Don't we, Cass?

39:20.254 --> 39:21.421
Can we focus?

39:21.422 --> 39:23.298
We have ten days before trial
and we have to sift through

39:23.299 --> 39:26.594
all of this with a fine-toothed comb.

39:26.635 --> 39:28.387
I'm all yours.

39:30.598 --> 39:31.557
Don't the uh...

39:31.599 --> 39:34.101
the kids need a little snack or something?

39:34.102 --> 39:34.728
Sure.

39:34.769 --> 39:36.020
Can I get you anything?

39:36.062 --> 39:38.606
Coffee? Tea?

39:38.607 --> 39:40.233
In a sippy cup?

39:46.197 --> 39:47.073
I want to stop.

39:47.074 --> 39:48.616
Come on, one more time.

39:48.617 --> 39:50.410
I'm right here, I will not let you fall.

39:50.452 --> 39:52.871
No.

39:52.912 --> 39:54.206
Ok.

40:01.881 --> 40:03.215
You know what?

40:03.257 --> 40:04.317
I'm gonna give you something

40:04.341 --> 40:07.428
that's kept me safe over the years.

40:07.470 --> 40:09.514
I've had this on a dozen summits

40:09.555 --> 40:13.226
and across an ocean and back.

40:13.268 --> 40:14.809
Does it really work?

40:14.810 --> 40:16.687
Well, I'm still here.

40:16.729 --> 40:19.274
But you uh, you better tuck it in.

40:19.315 --> 40:20.942
Otherwise you'll look like a geek.

40:20.984 --> 40:22.110
Hi guys!

40:22.152 --> 40:23.236
Hey, grandma.

40:23.278 --> 40:24.486
Look at this!

40:24.487 --> 40:25.487
Hi.

40:25.488 --> 40:26.156
Wow.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.324
Why don't we take five?

40:28.366 --> 40:29.575
Awesome wall.

40:29.618 --> 40:31.493
Give me a hug!

40:31.494 --> 40:32.453
I love ya.

40:32.496 --> 40:33.914
You too.

40:36.207 --> 40:38.794
Do you want this back?

40:38.835 --> 40:40.254
No, buddy.

40:40.296 --> 40:41.837
You keep it.

40:41.838 --> 40:43.632
Thanks.

40:45.842 --> 40:48.554
So, how's it going here?

40:48.595 --> 40:49.972
I'm doing my best.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.307
Cass is pretty intense,

40:51.348 --> 40:52.974
but she's under a lot of pressure.

40:52.975 --> 40:55.311
Yeah, but so are you.

40:55.352 --> 40:57.605
There's a marina at stake.

40:57.647 --> 41:01.525
Well, where is my high-maintenance Scorpio?

41:01.526 --> 41:03.694
She's inside with um...

41:03.695 --> 41:06.239
Henry from the office.

41:15.498 --> 41:17.041
Seems like a nice guy.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.669
Oh, I... I don't know about that.

41:19.712 --> 41:21.338
He's...

41:36.437 --> 41:37.729
Oh no.

41:37.730 --> 41:40.316
Didn't anyone tell you?

41:40.358 --> 41:41.985
Tell me what?

41:42.026 --> 41:44.779
It's Sunday.

41:44.821 --> 41:46.364
Try telling my client that.

41:46.405 --> 41:47.781
Come on, it's nice out.

41:47.782 --> 41:50.159
It's a perfect day for a family outing.

41:50.201 --> 41:53.829
Yeah, grab some sunshine for me
and tell the trees I say hello.

41:53.830 --> 41:55.415
Uh, I said "family outing".

41:55.457 --> 41:58.917
It's right thereon the big board.

41:58.918 --> 42:00.961
Are you using the board against me?

42:00.962 --> 42:03.589
Well, the law applies equally to all.

42:03.590 --> 42:05.443
And I planned a little
adventure for us, alright?

42:05.467 --> 42:08.303
It's time for everyone to come
to my house for a change.

42:08.345 --> 42:10.597
Dude, you live on a boat.

42:11.306 --> 42:12.224
Exactly.

42:12.266 --> 42:12.850
Alright?

42:12.892 --> 42:14.059
It'll be fun.

42:14.101 --> 42:17.563
Unless you're too afraid to
step outside your comfort zone.

42:19.189 --> 42:22.527
I'm just sayin'.

42:22.568 --> 42:26.406
♪ ♪

42:26.447 --> 42:27.282
Are you excited, bud?

42:27.283 --> 42:28.283
Yeah.

42:28.284 --> 42:29.449
Yeah.

42:29.450 --> 42:30.576
I'm kinda scared.

42:30.618 --> 42:33.663
You don't have to worry,
you're going to love sailing.

42:33.704 --> 42:35.498
All aboard!

42:35.540 --> 42:36.291
Here we go.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.001
Ok, careful.

42:38.043 --> 42:39.544
Atta boy.

42:41.296 --> 42:41.838
Alright.

42:41.880 --> 42:42.756
Young lady.

42:42.798 --> 42:44.758
Watch your step.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.134
Madam.

42:46.176 --> 42:47.301
Thank you.

42:47.302 --> 42:49.262
Improvement.

42:49.304 --> 42:50.138
Huh?

42:50.139 --> 42:51.307
Improvement.

42:51.348 --> 42:52.724
Oh, yeah.

42:52.766 --> 42:55.101
The proper shoes.

42:55.144 --> 42:58.605
So, let me show you around my living room.

42:58.647 --> 43:01.025
Those are my curtains.

43:01.067 --> 43:02.526
That one we call the main sail.

43:02.568 --> 43:05.029
It's the one that helps us
catch the wind and go fast.

43:05.071 --> 43:06.948
It's attached to the boat by the boom,

43:06.989 --> 43:08.990
and up front we have the jib.

43:08.991 --> 43:13.580
But the main sail is the most
important thing on this lady.

43:13.621 --> 43:15.289
The boat is a lady?

43:15.331 --> 43:17.249
All boats are ladies, Quinn,

43:17.291 --> 43:21.170
and like ladies they require
gentle handling and respect.

43:21.171 --> 43:22.963
Ooh, you're good.

43:22.964 --> 43:24.466
Thought you'd like that.

43:24.507 --> 43:25.883
Where do you eat on this thing?

43:25.925 --> 43:26.884
Or go to the bathroom?

43:26.926 --> 43:28.636
Or sleep?

43:28.678 --> 43:30.512
Down there, in the cabin.

43:30.513 --> 43:31.513
Can we go see?

43:31.514 --> 43:34.308
Sure. As long as your mom thinks it's cool.

43:34.309 --> 43:36.185
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

43:36.186 --> 43:38.438
Don't break anything.

43:40.065 --> 43:44.152
I think we got a couple
of sailors on our hands.

43:44.194 --> 43:45.779
Yeah?

43:45.821 --> 43:48.574
Probably not.

43:48.616 --> 43:51.077
You seem pretty comfortable
on the water though.

43:51.119 --> 43:53.370
Pirate in a previous life, maybe?

43:53.371 --> 43:57.875
I always thought your father
and you were the pirates.

43:57.876 --> 44:01.796
Uh, yeah, he racked up a lot of treasure.

44:01.838 --> 44:03.381
Is he the uh...

44:03.422 --> 44:06.760
the reason that you chose to leave?

44:06.801 --> 44:08.469
He cast a pretty big shadow.

44:08.470 --> 44:10.430
I needed to find my own way.

44:10.472 --> 44:12.222
Did you?

44:12.223 --> 44:15.602
I'm still looking.

44:15.644 --> 44:17.854
Uh oh, smells like rain.

44:17.896 --> 44:20.440
Maybe we shouldn't sail today.

44:20.482 --> 44:21.565
Here.

44:21.566 --> 44:22.401
Oh, no, no.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.235
I'm fine.

44:23.236 --> 44:24.653
Thanks, Mr. Weathervane.

44:32.077 --> 44:33.496
Ugh.

44:34.664 --> 44:35.914
Hey, uh, can I-

44:35.915 --> 44:39.544
Just take care of the kids sol
can write this brief, please?

44:39.585 --> 44:41.586
You're never gonna get better
if you don't get some rest.

44:41.587 --> 44:45.383
I know, thank you, but I don't have time.

44:48.344 --> 44:49.888
Ok.

46:22.609 --> 46:24.693
No.

46:24.694 --> 46:25.694
Oh no!

46:25.695 --> 46:28.072
Good morning.

46:28.114 --> 46:29.908
You let me sleep!

46:29.949 --> 46:33.078
My brief is due this morning.

46:33.120 --> 46:37.416
Here's some freshly squeezed vitamin C,

46:37.457 --> 46:39.668
and some reading material.

46:42.963 --> 46:44.213
Wh... what's this?

46:44.214 --> 46:46.592
I remembered a few things from law school.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.728
What...

46:59.647 --> 47:01.482
I wanna come down.

47:01.524 --> 47:02.943
Ok.

47:07.906 --> 47:08.906
Good job.

47:08.907 --> 47:14.580
Ok, so next time we'll
just go a little higher.

47:14.621 --> 47:16.581
Matthew!

47:16.582 --> 47:17.624
I- you know what?

47:17.666 --> 47:20.085
I'm... sorry I stuck my
nose in your business...

47:20.126 --> 47:22.754
No, it's good!

47:22.796 --> 47:24.589
Thank you.

47:24.590 --> 47:25.841
You're welcome.

47:25.882 --> 47:27.301
I just don't really understand

47:27.343 --> 47:29.802
why you didn't become a lawyer because...

47:29.803 --> 47:31.806
you've really got a knack for this.

47:31.848 --> 47:33.390
Nah, law's too black and white for me.

47:33.432 --> 47:35.184
I'm more of a win-win kinda guy.

47:38.605 --> 47:39.771
Ah!

47:39.772 --> 47:41.398
I gotta run.

47:41.441 --> 47:43.192
I love you guys!

47:43.234 --> 47:46.278
Not you, you.

47:46.279 --> 47:48.531
Anyway, um... bye.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.617
Love you.

47:52.369 --> 47:54.746
So, school it is.

47:54.787 --> 47:55.873
Let's go.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.463

48:04.464 --> 48:06.091
A tout a l'heure.

48:06.133 --> 48:06.967
You know French?

48:06.968 --> 48:08.635
Mais, oui.

Hey, gang.

48:41.295 --> 48:42.337
How'd it go?

48:42.379 --> 48:43.963
It was school.

48:44.005 --> 48:46.425
Right.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.135

48:58.353 --> 48:59.772

enough of that schedule.

01:02:37.578 --> 01:02:41.206
I just heard a rumor you reached
out to opposing council

01:02:41.207 --> 01:02:44.836
offering an olive branch asking to settle?

01:02:44.878 --> 01:02:45.962
No, not exactly.

01:02:46.004 --> 01:02:48.590
I was uh... exploring something that-

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.008
You can't be serious.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.344
We landed this case because we promised

01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:54.095
to take no prisoners.

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.388
Vincent, I-

01:02:55.389 --> 01:02:57.700
Adam is going to fire us if we
don't give him what he wants.

01:02:57.724 --> 01:02:59.725
We go to trial in three days.

01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:01.061
He hired a tiger.

01:03:01.062 --> 01:03:04.523
I need to know, is she going to deliver?

01:03:04.565 --> 01:03:06.275
She will.

01:03:06.317 --> 01:03:08.069
She better.

01:03:10.446 --> 01:03:11.698
Forget what I said, Howard.

01:03:11.739 --> 01:03:12.739
Bring a stretcher to court

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.535
because you're not getting
out of there alive!

01:03:15.577 --> 01:03:16.453
Matthew called.

01:03:16.454 --> 01:03:18.244
Something about a barbecue of some kind.

01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:19.205
Should I call to cancel?

01:03:19.206 --> 01:03:20.873
No, no, I'll make it.

01:03:20.915 --> 01:03:22.959
Ok, go and get Henry.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.019
I need all the depositions.

01:03:24.043 --> 01:03:26.587
Hold my calls, we're going to Defcon three.

01:03:26.588 --> 01:03:28.006
Got it.

01:03:33.762 --> 01:03:35.263
What a treat.

01:03:35.305 --> 01:03:37.390
A home cooked meal cooked on land.

01:03:37.432 --> 01:03:38.183
Yeah.

01:03:38.225 --> 01:03:39.767
Thank you for inviting us, Matthew.

01:03:39.768 --> 01:03:40.603
Oh, my pleasure.

01:03:40.604 --> 01:03:43.021
Now, where are my sous chefs at?

01:03:44.857 --> 01:03:48.110
Let's assembly line the heck
out of this thing, alright?

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.614
Shouldn't we wait for mom?

01:03:51.655 --> 01:03:53.282
She'll be home soon.

01:03:53.324 --> 01:03:54.117
Let's eat!

01:03:54.118 --> 01:03:56.784
Oh, those smell so good.

01:03:56.785 --> 01:03:57.703
Ok, pass off.

01:03:57.745 --> 01:03:58.412
Go.

01:03:58.454 --> 01:03:59.205
Here.

01:03:59.247 --> 01:04:01.750
Oh, you guys make a great team.

01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:02.935
It looks like our plan worked.

01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:05.002
The kids are crazy about him.

01:04:05.003 --> 01:04:06.921
Matthew might win this bet after all.

01:04:06.963 --> 01:04:08.964
I wouldn't count on it just yet.

01:04:08.965 --> 01:04:10.216
I know my son.

01:04:10.258 --> 01:04:12.134
He might sail off before it's over.

01:04:12.135 --> 01:04:13.887
What bet?

01:04:13.928 --> 01:04:15.889
Bet?

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.641
Oh, I didn't say "bet", I said "get".

01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:21.186
Get Charles a burger, ok?

01:04:21.228 --> 01:04:23.563
Your wish is my command.

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:27.484
There you go.

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:30.821
Hey, Quinn.

01:04:30.863 --> 01:04:32.031
You ok?

01:04:32.072 --> 01:04:35.410
Yeah, I just wish mommas here.

01:04:38.579 --> 01:04:39.914
Oh.

01:04:39.955 --> 01:04:41.957
Alright, let's eat.

01:04:45.503 --> 01:04:46.837
What time is it?

01:04:46.879 --> 01:04:50.633
Uh, I don't know... 9:00?

01:04:50.675 --> 01:04:51.551
No!

01:04:51.592 --> 01:04:52.969
Oh...

01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:53.929
What?

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.140
The barbecue.

01:04:57.182 --> 01:04:58.849
9:00? The kids are in bed.

01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:02.646
Oh, isn't anything going to go right today?

01:05:02.688 --> 01:05:03.688
It's late, ok?

01:05:03.689 --> 01:05:05.273
Um, you're tired.

01:05:05.316 --> 01:05:06.775
Why don't I drive you home?

01:05:06.817 --> 01:05:09.653
We'll go over the rest
of the case in the car.

01:05:19.621 --> 01:05:21.833
Oh, thank you for dropping me off.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.168
Cass, don't think twice about it.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:28.798
Come on, you know I'm always here for you.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.549
Which reminds me,

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:33.470
the marina gala is coming up.

01:05:33.511 --> 01:05:34.679
Do you wanna go?

01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:36.139
Oh, we have to.

01:05:36.181 --> 01:05:40.768
Vincent says it's mandatory,
and Haskey bought a table.

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.982
Actually, I meant with me.

01:05:45.023 --> 01:05:46.357
Oh.

01:05:46.358 --> 01:05:49.778
Yeah, we could do that.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.780
Great.

01:05:57.285 --> 01:05:59.162
G'night!

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.321
Hi sweetie.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:37.494
I'm so sorry I missed the barbecue.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:40.580
You know, I really wanted to be there.

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:43.333
It's ok.

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:46.837
Matthew was there.

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:54.304
Is Matthew gonna leave if he wins his bet?

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:56.472
What are you talking about?

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:06.232
Oh, she returns.

01:07:06.274 --> 01:07:08.317
Slammed at work, were we?

01:07:08.318 --> 01:07:09.194
Yes, I was.

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:10.986
Henry and I had a ton of work to do.

01:07:10.987 --> 01:07:12.238
Yeah. Henry.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.907
Yeah. Henry.

01:07:13.949 --> 01:07:16.992
This is a very important case to us.

01:07:16.993 --> 01:07:17.536
To me.

01:07:17.578 --> 01:07:18.828
I could make partner.

01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:20.247
Great.

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:22.165
I don't need to explain myself.

01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:26.001
What is this that I'm hearing about a bet?

01:07:26.002 --> 01:07:27.503
Bet?

01:07:27.504 --> 01:07:28.546
It's nothing, ok?

01:07:28.547 --> 01:07:31.050
Oh, it's something if it
involves me and my family.

01:07:31.092 --> 01:07:33.176
It's not how it sounds.

01:07:33.177 --> 01:07:35.511
My dad was gonna build
condos at the marina,

01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:36.680
and I had to stop him,

01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:39.433
and the only way I could do
it was by taking the job.

01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:41.060
To prove what?

01:07:41.102 --> 01:07:43.480
That you could take care of my kids?

01:07:43.521 --> 01:07:46.190
That's not how it went, Cass.

01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:47.817
So my children were pawns

01:07:47.859 --> 01:07:50.362
in your power struggle with your father?

01:07:50.403 --> 01:07:51.695
Please!

01:07:51.696 --> 01:07:53.030
You know how I feel about Emma and Quinn.

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:53.948
Don't even bring them-

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:54.574
You know what?

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:55.783
You are still the same

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:59.037
immature, irresponsible guy
that I knew in high school.

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:01.039
And you are still the head
strong, self-righteous

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:01.957
individual who just-

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.792
You don't get to lecture me!

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:05.794
You're not letting me explain!

01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:07.505
Explain what?

01:08:07.546 --> 01:08:11.048
How you waltzed in here and
pulled one over on my family?

01:08:11.049 --> 01:08:12.551
At the start, the-

01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:14.051
everything has changed, ok?

01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:15.804
Oh, it's changed alright.

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:17.348
You're fired.

01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:19.724
Cass, will you just-

01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:22.728
Just pack your stuff and leave!

01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:30.444
She looks pretty, huh?

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:37.243
Hey, what's going on with you?

01:08:37.285 --> 01:08:40.747
I don't want to go to
the stupid talent show.

01:08:40.788 --> 01:08:41.581
Why not?

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:43.582
You've been practicing so hard.

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:45.335
You're so good.

01:08:45.377 --> 01:08:47.962
Without Matthew I'll screw up.

01:08:48.005 --> 01:08:51.091
I wish he was gonna come.

01:08:51.133 --> 01:08:52.926
He's not.

01:08:52.968 --> 01:08:56.429
Matthew's gone.

01:08:56.430 --> 01:09:00.225
Gone, but not forgotten.

01:09:23.249 --> 01:09:25.459
Mr. Sheperd, do you agree
that the code in question

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:31.216
is the same code that you
developed with my client?

01:09:31.256 --> 01:09:33.509
I've written a million lines
of code over the years.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:35.929
I borrow from myself all the time.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.348
Just answer the question.

01:09:37.389 --> 01:09:40.475
No, I don't agree.

01:09:42.103 --> 01:09:44.104
Uh, exhibit A please?

01:09:49.526 --> 01:09:50.444
A cocktail napkin?

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.822
Yes, a cocktail napkin.

01:09:52.863 --> 01:09:54.490
It's also a signed contract

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:59.287
which we received in discovery from you.

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:06.211
It says "All new inventions
will be owned by the company."

01:10:06.253 --> 01:10:08.337
Does that signature look familiar?

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.924
It should. It's yours.

01:10:10.966 --> 01:10:12.174
Yeah, it's mine.

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:14.636
That proves that you were under contract.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:15.345
No it doesn't.

01:10:15.346 --> 01:10:16.888
It's not dated.

01:10:16.889 --> 01:10:19.849
For all I know, that was signed years

01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:22.436
after I started working with Adam.

01:10:22.478 --> 01:10:24.730
That would mean that everything

01:10:24.772 --> 01:10:27.441
I created before that was mine.

01:10:27.483 --> 01:10:29.151
I thought that you said she was a tiger.

01:10:29.152 --> 01:10:31.069
Just give her a minute.

01:10:31.112 --> 01:10:34.282
Uh, please could you present exhibit B?

01:10:36.534 --> 01:10:38.787
Is this a photo of you and the Plaintiff

01:10:38.828 --> 01:10:43.708
celebrating your first
day, in your first office?

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.459
Yeah.

01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:48.505
Can we go in a little closer please?

01:10:52.426 --> 01:10:56.680
Ah, the contract in question.

01:10:56.721 --> 01:10:59.099
Apparently it is dated.

01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:06.730
This proves that Mr. Benjamin Sheperd

01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:10.194
was under contract from the very first day

01:11:10.235 --> 01:11:13.113
that company was created.

01:11:15.741 --> 01:11:18.242
No further questions, your honor.

01:11:18.243 --> 01:11:19.078
Yes.

01:11:19.119 --> 01:11:22.581
I told you she'd nail him, right?

01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:24.500
We'll take a short recess.

01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:27.146
Look, I-it's too bad that you're gonna have

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:29.630
to lose millions over this.

01:11:29.672 --> 01:11:30.755
Yeah.

01:11:30.756 --> 01:11:32.234
All I wanted was for you to
just say that I was right

01:11:32.258 --> 01:11:36.221
and you were wrong for once, you know?

01:11:36.262 --> 01:11:39.432
Well, congratulations.

01:11:39.474 --> 01:11:42.936
You're going to get what you want.

01:11:42.978 --> 01:11:45.230
You were right.

01:11:48.942 --> 01:11:50.277
Ms. McKay.

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:52.279
Your summation?

01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.703
You know, during this case

01:11:59.745 --> 01:12:04.083
we have presented rock solid evidence,

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:08.295
stubborn facts, stubborn people.

01:12:08.337 --> 01:12:14.386
These two people were friends
that have worked together,

01:12:14.427 --> 01:12:16.846
dreamed together,

01:12:16.888 --> 01:12:19.307
and have huge success together.

01:12:19.349 --> 01:12:22.102
They have built something much, much bigger

01:12:22.144 --> 01:12:23.854
than a company.

01:12:23.896 --> 01:12:26.480
They have shared history.

01:12:26.481 --> 01:12:28.482
A true friendship.

01:12:28.483 --> 01:12:31.361
Now, I like to win

01:12:31.403 --> 01:12:38.577
but sometimes the real victory
is when everybody wins.

01:12:38.619 --> 01:12:39.763
I have no idea what she's trying to-

01:12:39.787 --> 01:12:41.372
I think I do.

01:12:43.999 --> 01:12:45.126
I uh...

01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:56.179
Your honor, may we approach?

01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:06.481
Hi, Cass, um... I just wanna say thank you.

01:13:06.523 --> 01:13:08.691
Benji and I, we uh...

01:13:08.692 --> 01:13:10.693
we couldn't have gotten to
this point without you,

01:13:10.694 --> 01:13:12.027
so thank you.

01:13:12.028 --> 01:13:13.530
I'm happy for you.

01:13:13.572 --> 01:13:15.407
See you later.

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:18.077
Cass.

01:13:18.118 --> 01:13:21.329
That was a pretty dangerous
move back there.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.666
But you pulled it off.

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:26.375
Looks like we'll be Adam's go-to firm.

01:13:26.376 --> 01:13:29.171
That took a lot of guts, Cass.

01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:31.215
Sometimes you have to trust me.

01:13:31.256 --> 01:13:33.343
We can talk about that
tonight at the marina gala.

01:13:33.384 --> 01:13:35.052
There's a new client I want you to meet.

01:13:35.094 --> 01:13:36.886
Could be bigger than Adam.

01:13:36.887 --> 01:13:39.099
I'll be there.

01:13:44.312 --> 01:13:49.735
Honey, I am so sorry about how
things ended up with Matthew.

01:13:49.776 --> 01:13:51.527
I honestly thought I was doing a good thing

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.238
putting you two together.

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:55.866
I know, mom.

01:13:55.907 --> 01:13:57.700
You had good intentions.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:58.535
Yeah, but you know what?

01:13:58.577 --> 01:14:00.953
I shouldn't have meddled.

01:14:00.954 --> 01:14:04.082
I shouldn't have done a lot of things.

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:05.584
Listen to me.

01:14:05.626 --> 01:14:11.257
You are a really good mom, ok?

01:14:11.298 --> 01:14:14.093
You're pretty wonderful yourself.

01:14:21.601 --> 01:14:22.560
Dad.

01:14:22.602 --> 01:14:26.522
Son.

01:14:26.523 --> 01:14:28.940
You didn't return my calls.

01:14:28.941 --> 01:14:32.695
I was beginning to think you'd
pulled up anchor again.

01:14:32.737 --> 01:14:34.990
It crossed my mind.

01:14:35.032 --> 01:14:37.449
You coming to the gala tonight?

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.493
Why?

01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:40.537
So you can rub it in my
face that I lost the bet?

01:14:40.578 --> 01:14:43.956
To be honest, I was
hoping you wouldn't lose.

01:14:43.957 --> 01:14:47.335
Yeah, well...

01:14:47.377 --> 01:14:50.756
so was I.

01:14:50.798 --> 01:14:52.150
But this was never about you or me.

01:14:52.174 --> 01:14:54.027
A lot of people's lives are
gonna be turned upside down

01:14:54.051 --> 01:14:55.678
when you tear this place down.

01:14:55.719 --> 01:14:57.804
Just come to the gala.

01:14:57.805 --> 01:14:59.890
Why would I do that, dad?

01:15:01.976 --> 01:15:05.396
I saw Cass's name on the guest list.

01:15:05.438 --> 01:15:08.107
Just tell her that your old
man's a dope and forced

01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:11.736
you to make a bet that should
never have been wagered.

01:15:11.778 --> 01:15:14.197
It doesn't matter.

01:15:14.238 --> 01:15:16.240
She's seeing someone.

01:15:16.282 --> 01:15:18.284
A guy from work.

01:15:19.828 --> 01:15:21.079
You sure about that?

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.543
Only one way to find out.

01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:35.176
Sweetie, stage fright is perfectly normal.

01:15:35.177 --> 01:15:37.178
As a matter of fact, it
could be a good thing.

01:15:37.179 --> 01:15:39.890
Just use it to electrify your performance.

01:15:39.932 --> 01:15:40.766
I feel sick.

01:15:40.808 --> 01:15:42.727
Oh, use that, too.

01:15:46.689 --> 01:15:48.857
Whoo.

01:15:48.858 --> 01:15:50.610
Woah, mom.

01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:52.945
You look like a movie star.

01:15:52.987 --> 01:15:54.780
Aw, thank you, baby.

01:15:54.822 --> 01:15:56.365
Mom, which one?

01:15:56.366 --> 01:15:58.200
You're asking me?

01:15:58.201 --> 01:15:59.368
Mom.

01:15:59.369 --> 01:16:00.161
Uh, pink.

01:16:00.162 --> 01:16:01.871
Definitely the pink.

01:16:01.872 --> 01:16:03.372
Ok.

01:16:03.373 --> 01:16:04.832
Listen up troops.

01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:06.686
I've gotta go to this work thing
and then I'm gonna meet you

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:09.545
at school before the talent show.

01:16:09.546 --> 01:16:10.255
Don't be late.

01:16:10.296 --> 01:16:12.382
Or we could be really late.

01:16:12.383 --> 01:16:14.174
So late that we could miss the whole thing.

01:16:14.175 --> 01:16:15.343
Would you stop worrying?

01:16:15.344 --> 01:16:17.679
You're gonna be amazing.

01:16:25.104 --> 01:16:26.773
Are you really that scared?

01:16:26.814 --> 01:16:29.400
Maybe.

01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:30.901
I'll be there.

01:16:30.902 --> 01:16:34.154
Not if you get caught
up in your work thing.

01:16:34.155 --> 01:16:36.658
It wouldn't be the first time.

01:16:43.581 --> 01:16:49.462
I see.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:52.132
Then I am not going to this party.

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.257
Really?

01:16:53.258 --> 01:16:54.760
Yep.

01:16:58.096 --> 01:17:01.349
There's nothing more important
than the two of you.

01:17:21.162 --> 01:17:21.830
Where is she?

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:22.871
She's supposed to be here.

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.373
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

01:17:24.415 --> 01:17:26.084
She better be.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.297
I understand.

01:17:33.467 --> 01:17:35.634
Mom, it's ok.

01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:37.721
You can answer it.

01:17:40.599 --> 01:17:41.100
Hello?

01:17:41.141 --> 01:17:41.976
What the heck, Cass?

01:17:41.977 --> 01:17:43.518
Adam's been asking about you,

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.519
and you're not here to meet the new client.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.688
Something extremely important came up.

01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:49.149
What could possibly compare to the-

01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:52.027
Please give my apologies
to Adam and the team.

01:17:52.069 --> 01:17:53.820
You're risking your partnership here.

01:17:53.821 --> 01:17:56.866
Nothing is more important than my family.

01:17:56.907 --> 01:17:58.868
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.419
So, what do you think?

01:18:08.461 --> 01:18:11.046
It's up to you.

01:18:11.047 --> 01:18:14.550
Do you want to give the show a shot?

01:18:14.592 --> 01:18:15.969
Or not?

01:18:16.011 --> 01:18:19.430
We can still make it if we hurry.

01:18:19.472 --> 01:18:20.515
Ok.

01:18:20.516 --> 01:18:21.141
Let's do this.

01:18:21.182 --> 01:18:23.519
Yes, it's showtime!

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.978
Let's go!

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.063
Alright, kids.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.959
Can I have your attention please?

01:18:49.504 --> 01:18:51.713
As you all know,

01:18:51.714 --> 01:18:55.427
I've had plans for the
marina for a long time.

01:18:55.468 --> 01:18:58.011
Big plans.

01:18:58.012 --> 01:19:03.185
Tonight I want to announce
that those plans have changed.

01:19:03.226 --> 01:19:04.393
Charles Walker Industries

01:19:04.394 --> 01:19:08.565
will not be breaking ground
for a new condo project.

01:19:08.606 --> 01:19:15.404
Instead, I'm authorizing the
complete marina restoration.

01:19:15.405 --> 01:19:20.076
And thanks to the persistent
and compassionate efforts

01:19:20.077 --> 01:19:22.745
of our own Matthew Walker,

01:19:22.746 --> 01:19:25.458
I've come to see that the marina,

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:30.087
this dirty old marina, has value.

01:19:30.088 --> 01:19:32.340
That is, if Matthew will agree to work with

01:19:32.381 --> 01:19:34.925
his old man on this.

01:19:34.926 --> 01:19:36.636
You got it, pops.

01:19:48.648 --> 01:19:49.733
Sorry pops,

01:19:49.774 --> 01:19:50.108
I...

01:19:50.109 --> 01:19:52.194
Go.

01:20:18.929 --> 01:20:20.765
Emma McKay?

01:20:20.806 --> 01:20:22.308
You're up in five, kid.

01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:42.120
She's next.

01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:47.209
Up next we have Emma McKayon violin.

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.349
Emma McKay.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:04.352
Please come out.

01:21:04.394 --> 01:21:06.479
Please.

01:21:32.089 --> 01:21:34.132
Excuse me, sorry.

01:21:34.174 --> 01:21:35.050
Coming through.

01:21:35.092 --> 01:21:38.262
Can I borrow those for a second, thanks?

01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:44.936
Oh, hi.

01:21:44.978 --> 01:21:48.815
Matthew, you made it.

01:21:48.857 --> 01:21:50.108
What on earth?

01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:53.111
Wouldn't miss it for the world, kiddo!

01:21:53.152 --> 01:21:55.780
Does he ever clean up nice.

01:22:59.471 --> 01:23:01.222
Emma McKay, everyone!

01:23:01.223 --> 01:23:04.475
And her special bongo buddy!

01:23:10.482 --> 01:23:11.275
Oh my god.

01:23:11.317 --> 01:23:12.318
Unbelievable.

01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:13.610
I know!

01:23:13.611 --> 01:23:16.030
I knew she could do it.

01:23:19.576 --> 01:23:20.618
Thank you so much.

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:21.536
No, thank you.

01:23:21.578 --> 01:23:22.412
That was a blast!

01:23:22.454 --> 01:23:25.457
And you did a great job, kiddo!

01:23:25.498 --> 01:23:27.667
You were fantastic!

01:23:30.337 --> 01:23:31.671
Didn't that feel good?

01:23:31.713 --> 01:23:32.630
Mmmhmm.

01:23:32.631 --> 01:23:33.756
Oh, and hey, could you take these bongos

01:23:33.757 --> 01:23:35.383
back to that kid out there?

01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:36.009
Please?

01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:37.302
Thanks.

01:23:41.098 --> 01:23:43.434
And you are something else.

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:45.977
Back atcha.

01:23:45.978 --> 01:23:48.105
And Cass, I'm sorry.

01:23:48.146 --> 01:23:51.859
I should have told you about
that bet and that was wrong.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:56.029
Hey, but I swear that the
time with you and the kids,

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.532
compared to that it was...

01:23:58.574 --> 01:24:01.870
it was nothing.

01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:04.038
I understand.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.334
What you did helped so many people.

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:11.338
If it's any consolation,

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.548
those weeks with you and
the kids were the...

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:17.261
best I've had in years.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:27.479
Are you uh... trying to
get your Manny job back?

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:30.274
Definitely... not.
