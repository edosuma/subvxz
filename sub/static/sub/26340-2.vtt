WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.902
Only on Fox.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.308
-Morning.
-(Margaret sighs)

00:07.342 --> 00:09.710
-Morning.
-Good morning. (laughs)

00:09.744 --> 00:13.548
It is a great morning, isn't it?
(chuckles)

00:16.584 --> 00:19.254
Any reason why you're
pouring rum on your pancakes?

00:19.287 --> 00:21.689
Any reason why your breath
smells like

00:21.722 --> 00:23.224
a graveyard port-o-potty?

00:23.258 --> 00:26.026
-Oh.
-Oh.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.062
It's the morning, Margaret.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.398
Yeah, he's a post-breakfast
brusher.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.368
Oh, why does his breath smell
like that at dinner, too?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.836
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.507
Margaret, you're pouring rum
on your pancakes.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.376
You're lashing out at Hank,

00:41.409 --> 00:44.445
for what is admittedly
a problem.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.247
What's going on with you?

00:46.281 --> 00:48.883
Nothing. I'm great.

00:48.916 --> 00:52.420
Oh, well, that's really a relief
to hear. Good for you.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.022
You weren't very good as a
parent, were you, Charlie?

00:55.055 --> 00:58.793
I think I was; I mean, they all
sued me, but none of them won.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.163
No, seriously, Margaret,
what is going on with you?

01:04.098 --> 01:06.567
There's the birthday girl.

01:06.601 --> 01:08.135
Happy 65th.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.438
-Oh. (chuckles)
-Oh.

01:10.471 --> 01:14.108
Okay, let's just don't make
a big deal of this.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.276
Of course not.

01:15.310 --> 01:19.246
We got a dusty crusty
right here!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.881
All right, gang.
We're gonna sing

01:20.915 --> 01:23.284
my favorite song ever written.
"Happy Birthday."

01:23.318 --> 01:24.452
* Happy...

01:24.485 --> 01:26.754
You really need to go.

01:26.787 --> 01:31.125
Okay, please, just nobody say
another word about my birthday.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.930
* 65! 65!

01:35.963 --> 01:41.302
* Our favorite girl
is still alive. *

01:45.940 --> 01:47.642
Bad time?

01:49.644 --> 01:51.546
*

02:11.399 --> 02:14.502
Ma'am, you are being
unreasonable.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.704
No, you're being unreasonable,
ma'am. Ma'am?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.939
Get this,
they won't take the cake back

02:18.973 --> 02:21.476
once you've been inside of it.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.812
So I guess I'm out $400 because
somebody doesn't like birthdays.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.315
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just not
excited about being a senior.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.317
There's something about
that word.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.287
For the first time in my life,
I feel... old.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.555
Well, too bad
there isn't something

02:34.589 --> 02:36.290
to make you feel childlike
and young like,

02:36.323 --> 02:37.692
oh, I don't know, a cake!

02:39.193 --> 02:42.397
Who says being a senior means
you're old? We're seniors.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.532
And we're in the primes
of our lives.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.903
And I tell you som... (coughs)

02:48.936 --> 02:50.204
(continues coughing)

02:50.237 --> 02:51.539
(clears throat)

02:52.907 --> 02:55.042
I happen to like being a senior.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.513
Nobody liked this sweater
when I was a teenager.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.348
I don't consider myself
a senior at all.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.318
I count my age from when
I came out to my wife

03:04.351 --> 03:06.253
and my new life began.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.156
New Year's Eve 1999.

03:09.189 --> 03:15.095
I was so scared about that Y2K,
I just... blurted it out.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.331
Far as I'm concerned, I'm 18.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.768
Barely legal.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.903
Is that when you started
dressing like

03:22.937 --> 03:25.573
an ice cream cone
with extra sprinkles?

03:25.606 --> 03:27.775
Ooh.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.277
Ooh-ooh.
I know what this is about.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.680
Hank, it's 'cause she's a woman.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.881
Excuse me?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.417
Shh. Margaret,
I'm talking to Hank.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.953
You see, men age gracefully.

03:38.986 --> 03:43.190
As we get older we become either
distinguished fancy men

03:43.223 --> 03:44.892
or grizzled cowboys.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.597
Or in my case,
a grizzled fancy man.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.867
Whereas with women,
it's either invisible

03:52.900 --> 03:55.135
or scary forest witch.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.371
Oh, screw you.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.973
What? I didn't say it.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.577
I'm just repeating what society
told me, Margaret.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.712
My boy is right.
You're not old.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.647
You're just upset
because society

04:06.681 --> 04:08.583
has tricked you
into thinking you're old.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.619
Did you just mansplain
gender politics to me?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.621
Baby. Baby, baby, listen.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.090
I don't think you're using the
term, "mansplaining" properly.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.793
Are you mansplaining
"mansplaining" to me?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.095
Don't answer.
It's a trick.

04:21.128 --> 04:25.132
Well, I am certainly excited to
become a scary forest witch.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.668
I'm just sorry you guys won't
be around to see it

04:27.702 --> 04:30.270
with your short little
male life spans.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.772
But here's a preview for you.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.974
(witchy voice):
You're old, Hank!

04:34.008 --> 04:36.443
You're all old!

04:36.477 --> 04:38.245
(normal voice):
And now, if you'll excuse me,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.948
I'm gonna go whip up some
Long Island Iced Teas

04:40.981 --> 04:42.883
in my cauldron!

04:48.355 --> 04:49.857
You know what we need to do?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.994
Yep, grab a couple flasks
and go hit that cauldron.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.797
We need to take her out for
a night on the town

04:56.831 --> 04:58.799
and convince her
that she is wrong,

04:58.833 --> 05:02.002
that we are not old
and that my breath smells good.

05:02.036 --> 05:06.607
I'm in. I mean, you would think
that a $400 cake

05:06.641 --> 05:09.944
would have cheered her up,
but I'm over it.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.445
I am over it.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.147
You know, it's about respect.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.816
It's just...

05:23.490 --> 05:25.292
(knocking on door)

05:25.325 --> 05:26.994
* Her name is Margaret

05:27.027 --> 05:28.529
* She's 65

05:28.563 --> 05:30.197
* She likes to party

05:30.230 --> 05:32.066
* She don't take no jive

05:32.099 --> 05:33.467
* Go, Margaret

05:33.500 --> 05:35.002
* Go, Margaret, go, Margaret

05:35.035 --> 05:37.838
* Go, Margaret, go, Margaret,
go, Margaret *

05:37.872 --> 05:39.574
(breathless):
* Go, Margaret, go, Margaret.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.308
-Are you all right?
-(Margaret laughs)

05:41.341 --> 05:43.343
What the hell is this?

05:43.377 --> 05:44.979
Margaret, put the liquor down.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.681
We're taking you out
to get drunk.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.984
No, you guys, I am fine
with my P-booze-and-J.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.520
And what the hell
are you guys wearing?

05:53.554 --> 05:56.023
You look like extras
in the "Beat It" video.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.391
This is Ver-sace.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.893
You mean Versace?

05:58.926 --> 06:02.529
No, I mean Ver-sace,
I couldn't afford the "ace."

06:02.563 --> 06:04.198
We're taking you out
for a good old-fashioned

06:04.231 --> 06:05.399
young person's night.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.936
I don't think young people
call it "young person's night."

06:08.969 --> 06:12.006
And I know they don't wear
fanny packs.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.074
Well, they should, 'cause
there's everything in here

06:14.108 --> 06:15.542
a young person could want.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.511
There's reading glasses,
comfort insoles,

06:17.544 --> 06:18.913
rolling papers,

06:18.946 --> 06:21.749
calcium toffee chews
for strong bones.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.550
You got my breath mints, right?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.485
Ooh, I hope so.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.956
Guys, let me hide
from my birthday

06:28.989 --> 06:30.625
the way I want to, okay?

06:30.658 --> 06:33.093
I'm gonna finish my little
P-booze-and-J.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.730
I'm gonna make a little
beer-rito for dinner.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.065
I'm gonna pound five or six
cocktails for dessert.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.567
Make a little nightcap
and I'm off to bed.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.436
You can eat all that crap
tomorrow.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.071
Hell, we'll even eat it
with you.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.941
But tonight, you're gonna have
the best birthday of your life.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.010
Put. This. On.

06:51.478 --> 06:55.716
Welcome to the coolest jazz club
in all of suburban Tucson:

06:55.750 --> 06:58.285
Ronnie's Swing Time Cafe.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.655
I'm gonna make sure we all
get taken care of

07:00.688 --> 07:03.824
'cause, you know, I know Ronnie.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.627
Wow, Hank, I had no idea
you were such a big shot

07:06.661 --> 07:09.664
in the outer metropolitan
nightlife world.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.099
You know, uh, Prince came up
in here one night.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.901
And I, myself,
gave him directions

07:13.934 --> 07:16.637
to the club
he was trying to get to.

07:16.671 --> 07:18.072
Can you hold this ChapStick?

07:18.105 --> 07:21.575
'Cause it's standing room only
in these pants.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.645
Well, let me see.
No room in the front.

07:24.679 --> 07:26.346
Let me check around back.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.782
Okay.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.116
You're wearing two fanny packs?

07:29.149 --> 07:33.087
No, I'm wearing one because
I only want half my stuff.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.090
Uh, listen,
we're almost to the bouncer.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.959
Can you guys be cool for ten
seconds? Let me handle this.

07:38.993 --> 07:40.861
What's up, my man? (laughs)

07:40.895 --> 07:44.298
My man, my man, my man, my man,
my man, my man, my man.

07:44.331 --> 07:49.036
How you living? Large? Listen,
uh, I'm a friend of Ronnie's.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.806
-I don't know any Ronnie.
-Well, sure you do.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.540
Isn't this Ronnie's
Swing Time Cafe?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.843
No, this is Twerk Lab.

07:55.876 --> 07:59.814
If only there was a way
we could've known.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.316
Well, what happened
to Ronnie's Swing Time Cafe?

08:02.349 --> 08:05.152
-It became Twerk Lab.
-Well, that was fun.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.487
Time to go? I want to get home
and journal about this

08:07.521 --> 08:09.156
while it's still fresh
in my mind.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.159
Going home is what
four old people would do,

08:12.192 --> 08:13.828
and we are not old.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.629
Uh, my good man. (chuckles)

08:15.662 --> 08:17.832
I got four dance scientists

08:17.865 --> 08:21.335
who are prepared
to enter the Twerk Lab.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.706
None of you are coming inside.
I would immediately be fired.

08:25.740 --> 08:31.378
(clears throat) How about
for three calcium chews?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.580
Guys, it's a no.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.415
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

08:35.449 --> 08:37.584
Four calcium chews.

08:37.617 --> 08:39.653
-Did you say four calcium chews?
-Uh-huh.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.255
Okay, all right, you got it.
Come on in.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.224
-You serious?
-No, I'm not. Back up, please.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.697
Joke's on that hater
'cause I know another way in.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.200
So, y'all can just thank me now

08:53.233 --> 08:55.202
after I open this...

08:55.235 --> 08:57.204
Damn.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.907
Ronnie never locked that door
back when I used to come here.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.043
Maybe that's why
Ronnie went out of business.

09:03.077 --> 09:06.013
You know, I bet someone could
crawl through there

09:06.046 --> 09:07.882
and open the door for us.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.818
If only one of us
was little enough.

09:11.886 --> 09:14.388
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.456
I know what y'all are thinking.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.693
Everybody loves
to hoist the little guy.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.561
We're a team, Sid.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.263
We all have a special skill.

09:23.297 --> 09:26.967
Mine is my big-ass brain
that works good, and yours is...

09:27.001 --> 09:29.303
Well, I lost
my train of thought.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.074
Here we go again.
I have heard it all before.

09:34.108 --> 09:36.210
"Sid, climb under that fence."

09:36.243 --> 09:39.579
"Sid, squeeze through that
doggy door and grab my keys."

09:39.613 --> 09:42.582
"Sid, hop on the conveyor belt
and go around baggage claim

09:42.616 --> 09:44.751
and see what the holdup is."

09:44.785 --> 09:47.654
Well, I'm not doing it anymore.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.456
Fine. Doesn't matter anyway.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.426
Hell, I don't think you would
fit with those extra pounds.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.294
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.630
Here it comes.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.741
(guttural grunt)

10:07.774 --> 10:09.944
Uh, unisex bathroom.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.947
Ooh, tres chic. (groans)

10:12.980 --> 10:15.850
Oh! Freakin' gross!

10:15.883 --> 10:18.953
My pashmina's
in the pee-pee!

10:18.986 --> 10:20.754
-Oh! Oh. Oh, I flushed it.
-(toilet flushing)

10:20.787 --> 10:22.990
I flushed it. I...
Can I get some help?

10:23.023 --> 10:26.460
Help! Help me! I'm going down.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.129
Oh!

10:29.163 --> 10:31.131
*

10:33.500 --> 10:37.171
God, I hope those gunshots
are part of the song.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.973
What are you talking about,
Margaret?

10:39.006 --> 10:40.507
This place is over the chain.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.543
Really? You into this sick beat?

10:43.577 --> 10:45.045
Why, yes, I am.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.447
This is probably one
of my favorite current tracks.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.050
Who is this artist?

10:50.084 --> 10:51.318
This artist performing
right here?

10:51.351 --> 10:54.321
-Yeah.
-Uh, this is probably, uh...

10:54.354 --> 10:57.824
Lil... (sighs)

10:57.858 --> 11:00.694
DJ... You Betcha.
(clears throat)

11:00.727 --> 11:02.462
Lil DJ You Betcha?

11:02.496 --> 11:05.332
-You betcha! Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.301
And singing this hook
right here?

11:07.334 --> 11:11.005
That's, um... I-I believe
that's my girl, uh, Shadoinka.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.008
Shadoinka? You know,
I don't think I've heard

11:14.041 --> 11:15.675
of either one of those artists.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.712
Well, that's 'cause you don't
follow the charts like I do.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.650
-Let's hit that dance floor,
birthday girl.
-Ugh.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.220
I'm feeling the beat in my seat.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.587
Just follow me.

11:27.621 --> 11:31.191
-I'm your wingman.
We're in this together.
-Okay.

11:31.225 --> 11:34.161
Whoo! Uh...

11:34.194 --> 11:38.365
-Sid!
-Damn it, Margaret, I'm busy!

11:38.398 --> 11:41.268
Read the room!

11:48.575 --> 11:51.778
Hi, sweetie. Are you lost?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.380
Is it that obvious?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.515
I have no idea
what I'm doing here. (chuckles)

11:55.549 --> 11:58.218
Well, maybe we can
figure it out together.

11:58.252 --> 12:00.720
This isn't real.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.756
This can't be real.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.725
Oh, it's real.
I promise it's real.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.362
Oh, my damn.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.297
(purring)

12:13.567 --> 12:15.369
Man, it's loud in here.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.271
You ever gonna
answer your phone?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.872
(loudly):
My phone's not ringing.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.108
That's not good.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.578
Can I have a Harvey Wallbanger,
please?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.313
He doesn't know what that is.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.582
That's why
I brought along a recipe.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.617
See?

12:30.650 --> 12:33.820
If you accept that you're old,
you can be prepared.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.556
I'm not old,
and I'll prove it to you.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.293
I hope you got binoculars
in your little, uh, belt purse,

12:39.326 --> 12:40.760
'cause you're gonna want
to see these moves.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.097
(chuckles)
Do I have binoculars?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.932
I do.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.567
Where do you live?
I'll take you home.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.438
Oh, you move fast, Lucas,
and I like it.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.108
I just don't want the people
who take care of you to worry.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.509
I know what it's like.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.844
My nana was always
wandering off, too.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.985
Wait a minute. So you mean
you're not trying to sleep me?

13:05.019 --> 13:08.555
You creep! You should
be ashamed of yourself!

13:10.624 --> 13:13.960
Your loss, buddy,
'cause this body knows things.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.033
*

13:22.836 --> 13:25.539
Evening, ladies.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.141
You gals like fresh trout?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.576
'Cause the moves I'm about
to show you are off the hook.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.313
He-he-he.

13:33.347 --> 13:36.483
-(pants ripping)
-Ow! Ooh.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.386
I tried to bust a move,
but the move busted me.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.122
Yeah, you ripped your pants
and your underpants.

13:42.156 --> 13:44.191
You got a lot going on
back there, pal.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.293
Listen, cover for me, Charlie.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.029
Let's make it to the bathroom.

13:49.063 --> 13:53.400
I truly am having the time
of my life.

14:00.707 --> 14:04.511
You know, earlier,
a young man called me Mr. T.

14:04.544 --> 14:08.615
Now the fool I'm pitying most
is myself.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.419
How's it coming
with my pants, Charlie?

14:12.452 --> 14:15.922
Uh, good. Almost done
sewing up your butthole here.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.660
Well, we're old.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.429
Happy birthday, Margaret.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.199
Would've been much happier
if I was in bed

14:25.232 --> 14:27.867
eating a booze-nana split
right now.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.569
But you two
dragged me down here,

14:29.603 --> 14:33.006
and I got blue-balled
by some jailbait hottie

14:33.039 --> 14:36.042
who mistook me
for his lost granny.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.846
Well, I got nothing
in my pack for that.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.117
But if it would help,
I'd be happy to hit on you.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.885
Aw, thanks, Charlie. (chuckles)

14:45.919 --> 14:48.054
Hello, gorgeous.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.927
What do you say you and I find
a mossy clearing in the woods

14:53.960 --> 14:56.062
and do what nature...

14:56.096 --> 14:58.965
Charlie, I meant "thanks"
like "I'm good."

14:58.998 --> 15:01.768
Whoo! I need a break.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.804
I keep telling these boys
not to fall in love,

15:04.838 --> 15:07.774
but they will not listen.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.077
You know what the worst part
about getting old is?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.413
Oh, this sounds like fun.

15:13.447 --> 15:17.083
I used to be excited
to do so many big things.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.719
Live in Paris.
Be a famous folk singer.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.122
Learn how to make a frittata.
And now...

15:22.156 --> 15:23.590
(scoffs) Not gonna happen.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.659
Honey, you can still make
that frittata.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.461
It's just eggs.

15:28.462 --> 15:29.763
You wanted to be a folk singer?

15:29.796 --> 15:34.168
I almost was. I recorded
a folk album back in 1971.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.336
Yeah, she played me
a couple cuts. It's pretty good.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.338
A minor record label
picked me up.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.440
I wrote it about
this relationship that I was in

15:40.474 --> 15:41.908
where I was stepped on
and ignored

15:41.941 --> 15:44.911
and taken for granted.
It was called Carpet.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.012
Wow, that's awful.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.781
Hmm. It was a tough time for me.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.983
No, I meant the album title.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.518
The worst part is

15:51.551 --> 15:53.187
the day before Carpet came out,

15:53.220 --> 15:56.122
Carole King released Tapestry.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.592
Now, that's
a professional title.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.360
Anyway,

16:00.394 --> 16:02.996
Tapestry blew Carpet
right out of the water.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.631
(chuckles)
I thought you were gonna say

16:04.664 --> 16:08.802
that Tapestry swept Carpet
under the rug.

16:08.835 --> 16:12.539
You missed an opportunity.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.542
Okay! Maybe that joke
will up the mood in here.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.844
I used to care
about so many things.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.446
Well, crud.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.148
-Now I don't really give a crap
about anything.
-(chuckles)

16:22.182 --> 16:23.550
But, Margaret,
you're missing the point.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.685
Not giving a crap
is the greatest thing

16:25.719 --> 16:26.886
about growing old.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.688
I mean, look at these two, okay?

16:28.722 --> 16:31.625
(crying): She's wearing
the same dress as me.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.693
I am an idiot!

16:35.729 --> 16:37.497
Ah.

16:37.531 --> 16:41.535
Remember how it felt to care
about everything all the time?

16:41.568 --> 16:43.036
-It was terrible.
-Yeah.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.039
And getting old,
you can just be yourself.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.508
Oh, I wish I could have
been myself earlier.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.210
I should have come out
of the closet

16:50.244 --> 16:52.879
the minute I knew I was gay
at age...

16:52.912 --> 16:54.314
uh, well, five.

16:54.348 --> 16:58.051
Well, no, four or five.
Whenever I saw Ben-Hur.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.354
You guys are right.
You know what?

17:00.387 --> 17:01.721
Being young sucks ass.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.190
And not giving a crap,
that's kind of my thing.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.525
I just, I let a number

17:05.559 --> 17:07.827
on the calendar
make me forget that.

17:07.861 --> 17:08.895
Yeah, I mean, so what?

17:08.928 --> 17:12.098
I took a chance, I danced,
I ripped my pants.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.833
(laughs)

17:13.867 --> 17:14.868
No, I know you were trying

17:14.901 --> 17:18.104
to be serious,
but that rhyming made me giggle.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.040
Hey, I have got ten minutes left
in my birthday,

17:21.074 --> 17:23.042
and I am not drunk enough.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.044
Oh, I can remedy that.
It's your 65th,

17:25.078 --> 17:27.781
so we're gonna do 65 shots each.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.215
Hank, I'll die.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.118
Okay, then. Uh, combined.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.020
-Party time!
-(all laugh)

17:34.053 --> 17:36.556
Ain't nothing
gonna slow us down now.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.492
(grunts)

17:44.331 --> 17:47.467
Yes, let's go! Whoo!

17:47.501 --> 17:49.603
(laughs)

17:49.636 --> 17:52.806
Okay, 65 shots
of premium tequila.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.441
That'll be $900.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.876
Here's 50 bucks.
Keep the change, brother.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.313
Um, I said $900.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.780
I can't hear you.
We're very old.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.115
Start drinking, Margaret.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.619
CHARLIE:
Excuse me.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.587
Um, it's my friend Margaret's
birthday,

18:07.621 --> 18:09.889
and she would like
to sing a song

18:09.923 --> 18:13.560
from her 1971
poorly titled album, Carpet.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.095
Oh, no, what is that
banana head doing?

18:16.129 --> 18:19.065
Come on, Margaret. You don't
give a crap what people think.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.434
Remember? In the bathroom?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.402
After I said we should have sex
in the forest?

18:22.436 --> 18:26.139
Stop talking, Charlie.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

18:29.343 --> 18:31.945
Hey, uh, sir, this-this isn't
a credit card, man.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.347
This is a room key.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.349
So what's the holdup?
Charge it to my room.

18:35.382 --> 18:39.353
Put a couple of burgers
on there, too.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.455
(clears throat)
Hi, uh, I'm Margaret.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.022
This one is called
"A Fresh Shag,

18:43.056 --> 18:46.793
"Parenthesis, Can't Cover
an Untreatable Stain,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.127
Close Parenthesis."

18:48.161 --> 18:51.898
My girl needs
some mad title help.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.437
* After all the years

18:57.471 --> 19:01.508
* We've spent together

19:01.541 --> 19:07.213
* So many stains
you've left on me *

19:07.246 --> 19:09.683
* Well, I've tried

19:09.716 --> 19:13.353
* And I've tried
to scrub them out *

19:13.387 --> 19:15.855
* But I can't

19:15.889 --> 19:21.194
* Bleach out
our messed-up history *

19:21.227 --> 19:25.899
Did I just drink 15 shots,
or does this sound kind of good?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.867
* But a fresh shag

19:27.901 --> 19:32.338
* Can't cover
an untreatable stain *

19:32.372 --> 19:34.708
* Because the stain
is the pain *

19:34.741 --> 19:36.643
* And the pain, it remains

19:36.676 --> 19:39.646
* And it won't go away.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.048
To Margaret!

19:42.081 --> 19:43.683
(whooping)

19:44.551 --> 19:45.752
It's time for you guys to go.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.522
All right, we're going.
Um, Sid, grab the bottle.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.924
Come on, guys. We got to go now.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.693
Thank you, Tucson. Good night!

19:55.028 --> 19:56.996
Hey.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.198
Your song was pretty cool.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.366
Oh, thanks, I...

20:00.400 --> 20:03.236
I didn't do it for you, loser.
I did it for me.

20:10.744 --> 20:14.280
Hey, thanks, you guys,
for last night.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.851
Screw you guys
for this hangover.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.186
I really should be dead.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.389
I'm not certain I'm not.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.459
Why are you all screaming?

20:27.561 --> 20:30.630
I can't reach my juice.

20:33.767 --> 20:36.102
Pancake party.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.204
Wow, you guys smell.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.440
I'm a post-breakfast brusher.

20:40.474 --> 20:42.041
No, I meant you smell
like alcohol.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.811
I guess somebody
had a good time last night.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.147
(groans) Miss Jennifer!

20:48.181 --> 20:50.316
When I get my strength back,

20:50.349 --> 20:54.353
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.792
What? No syrup?

20:58.825 --> 21:01.094
Okay, I gotcha.

21:01.127 --> 21:04.063
Little hair of the dog, boys?

21:04.097 --> 21:08.434
(all groan)

21:08.468 --> 21:11.971
Well, we did promise
to give these a shot.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.840
(clears throat)

21:14.974 --> 21:18.111
-Oh, hell, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:18.144 --> 21:22.549
Why didn't we just stay home
last night and eat these?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.318
That's pretty good.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.759
You've made the cut
with The Cool Kids.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.194
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.
