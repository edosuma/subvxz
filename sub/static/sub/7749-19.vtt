WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:07.297
POLMAR:
You faked metadata,
and Diane presented it in court

00:07.340 --> 00:08.762
to get Cary
released, yes?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.768
But Diane didn't
know it was faked.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.505
Yeah.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.768
You're caught.
You faked the metadata.

00:13.810 --> 00:16.370
If I were you,
I'd come clean.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.379
(no audio)

00:27.820 --> 00:29.629
Accusations are being
leveled tonight

00:29.660 --> 00:31.423
against Illinois First Lady

00:31.460 --> 00:33.655
and State's Attorney-elect
Alicia Florrick.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.669
Charges of possible election
fraud have been leveled,

00:36.700 --> 00:38.327
having to do
with voting machines

00:38.370 --> 00:39.189
in River North.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.333
Many voters complained
on Election Day

00:41.370 --> 00:42.564
about their touchscreen votes,

00:42.610 --> 00:45.101
believing that votes for Frank
Prady ended up as registered

00:45.140 --> 00:46.209
for Alicia Florrick.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.400
This was blamed

00:47.440 --> 00:48.577
on a calibration error.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.441
Touchscreen technology over time

00:50.480 --> 00:52.118
often suffers
from calibration drift,

00:52.150 --> 00:54.118
a loss of accuracy
of where exactly

00:54.150 --> 00:55.708
the finger of the voter presses.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.344
The revelation comes
on the heels of the release

00:58.390 --> 01:00.381
of numerous _
sexually-charged e-malls

01:00.420 --> 01:02.456
between the state's
attorney-elect

01:02.490 --> 01:04.128
and her former boss.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.128
Mrs. Florrick,
in an interview yesterday,

01:06.160 --> 01:07.798
characterized the e-mails
as nothing more

01:07.830 --> 01:09.593
than an office fantasy.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.191
It was a flirtation.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.459
An innocent one but a wrong one.

01:16.510 --> 01:20.139
I was having difficulties
with my husband at that point,

01:20.180 --> 01:21.374
and I got carried away.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.570
But many have seemed to turn

01:22.610 --> 01:24.578
against the once-admired
First Lady.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.578
I'm disappointed
in her, obviously.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.508
Look, I didn't think
she was a saint,

01:28.550 --> 01:31.189
but I don't like
how she pretended to be so...

01:31.220 --> 01:33.211
(no audio)

01:38.560 --> 01:40.357
Well, this is
a press witch hunt.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.789
They like building people up
so they can knock them down.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.798
Now it's Alicia's turn.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.663
I love my wife, obviously,
and I trust her implicitly.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.702
There was nothing
between my wife...
(door opens)

01:49.740 --> 01:50.764
...distant reaches...

01:50.810 --> 01:52.471
...pizza famous for their...

01:52.510 --> 01:54.478
Mom?

01:54.510 --> 01:55.534
You okay?

01:55.580 --> 01:57.377
Yeah.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.140
I was just watching...

02:00.180 --> 02:01.716
um... sharks.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.388
Is it too loud?

02:03.420 --> 02:05.513
No, you should go to bed.

02:05.550 --> 02:06.517
I will.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.584
MAN: Are you gonna get eaten?

02:07.620 --> 02:09.554
MAN 2: Hell, yeah.

02:09.590 --> 02:13.424
ANNOUNCER: No one has filmed
sharks here, from in the...

02:22.310 --> 02:23.629
What is that?

02:23.670 --> 02:25.706
It's a microchip.
Okay.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.435
Are you planning to build
a robot or something, Ken?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.472
No, I just thought
that you should know...

02:32.950 --> 02:34.542
I'm giving you
a warning, Eli.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.582
We're gonna
investigate.

02:36.620 --> 02:37.587
Investigate what?

02:37.620 --> 02:39.258
The election,
Mrs. Florrick.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.281
Come on, Ken,
this is bogus.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.481
She's getting some bad press,
and now you're going after her?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.919
This microchip was found
in a touchscreen voting machine

02:45.960 --> 02:47.552
in the 12th precinct.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.568
It's called a "man
in the middle" hack.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.262
That means, someone
inserts a device that...

02:52.300 --> 02:53.460
Well, I don't know
what it means,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.297
but people smarter than me
know what it means,

02:55.340 --> 02:56.500
and this thing
was programmed

02:56.540 --> 02:58.838
to override votes
in the 12th precinct.

02:58.870 --> 03:00.906
How'd you find it?

03:00.940 --> 03:02.498
A precinct captain saw
a screw loose

03:02.550 --> 03:04.609
on the side of one
of the machines.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.515
He opens it, found this
connected to the wiring.
Come on.

03:06.550 --> 03:08.541
How do you know he
didn't plant it?
I don't know.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.287
That's why the election board
has to investigate.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.298
You wearing
a wire, Ken?

03:20.330 --> 03:21.922
(scoffs)
Go to hell, Eli.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.928
That's the last time
I do you a favor.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.530
We did not hack any
voting machines.

03:26.570 --> 03:27.889
Good, then you'll
be cleared.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.567
ELI: Okay, okay, it's not
the end of the world.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.430
MARISSA: Stop burning a hole
in the carpet, Dad,

03:33.480 --> 03:34.469
and we might
believe you.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.501
What we have to do is
to stave off a recount.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.539
Alicia, are
you listening?

03:39.980 --> 03:41.914
Marissa, do you mind
getting us some coffee?

03:41.950 --> 03:43.588
How long do you need?

03:43.620 --> 03:45.645
'Cause there's
a falafel truck downstairs.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.317
Just the coffee. Thanks.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.458
RECEPTIONIST:
Florrick, Agos & Lockhart.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.491
Are we
in trouble, Eli?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.392
No.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.297
We haven't done
anything wrong?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.365
No, we did not.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.401
Someone else may have done
something wrong?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.005
Just tell me, Eli.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.598
That's the thing--
I don't know.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.800
The problem is
my supporters?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.806
One of them may have
hacked these machines?

04:11.850 --> 04:12.874
Yes.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.478
Bishop?

04:14.520 --> 04:16.317
Or Redmayne.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.510
He likes to
guarantee success.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.359
So we welcome
a recount.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.618
I mean, if I lose,
I lose.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.013
No, no, it's not
that simple.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.028
Elections are stolen
during recounts.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.528
There are too many hands
involved, too many lawsuits.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.528
These votes shouldn't be
counted, these votes should.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.391
And the press is
moving against you.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.567
That's always
a bad sign.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.534
Okay, so...

04:33.570 --> 04:34.764
what do we do?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.009
How's your friendship
with Prady?

04:38.040 --> 04:40.600
You want me
to talk to him?

04:40.640 --> 04:42.608
Your opponent has to
push for a recount.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.606
Tell him he doesn't
want to win that way.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.447
Not ugly.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.712
It doesn't end,
does it?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.558
You win the election,
you think it's over.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.989
It's never over.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.999
I wish I could tell you
that you're wrong,

05:00.030 --> 05:03.067
but you're right.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.295
Life...

05:07.840 --> 05:09.831
...sucks.

05:17.710 --> 05:18.938
Thank you.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.914
Yes?

05:22.950 --> 05:24.508
So, did you do it?

05:24.550 --> 05:25.744
Do what?

05:25.790 --> 05:27.758
Screw your boss.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.928
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that's any of your business.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.693
You don't get to decide
when it's my business.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.377
Oh, uh...

05:49.410 --> 05:50.570
You must be
Mr. Parillo.

05:50.610 --> 05:51.702
I must be.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.538
Is Mr. Prady coming?

05:54.580 --> 05:56.548
No.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.148
Did something
come up?

05:58.190 --> 05:59.782
Yeah, I did.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.856
I don't think
I understand.
I think you do.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.859
You wanted to convince Frank
not to ask for a recount.

06:04.890 --> 06:07.620
It's against his better
interests, right?

06:07.660 --> 06:08.752
But you're not dealing
with him anymore,

06:08.800 --> 06:10.097
you're dealing
with me now.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.927
And I'm not so
easily tricked.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.939
Okay, have Mr. Prady
call me if he wants.

06:14.970 --> 06:16.699
You will lose, ma'am.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.503
Because I'm gonna prove
to the election panel

06:18.540 --> 06:19.939
that you stole this election.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.572
Go ahead and walk away,

06:21.610 --> 06:23.771
but you can't walk away
from the election board.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.778
(sighs)
Thanks for the time, Diane.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.141
Actually, I'm just about

06:27.180 --> 06:28.772
to finish my report,

06:28.820 --> 06:30.788
and I needed one final
comment from you.

06:30.820 --> 06:33.789
Of course, but I'm not sure
what I can add at this point.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.811
MALE VOICE:
Gerald Giraffe feels happy.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.727
H-A-P-P-Y. Happy.
ANDREW: Hey, um,
can you, can you just

06:38.760 --> 06:41.422
hold off on that
for just a minute?

06:41.460 --> 06:42.825
I-I'm_not sure
either,

06:42.870 --> 06:44.826
but, um, it's come
to my attention

06:44.870 --> 06:46.064
that there's a problem
with the metadata

06:46.100 --> 06:47.897
that you submitted
as evidence in court.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.908
What kind of
a problem?

06:49.940 --> 06:51.100
Sad...

06:51.140 --> 06:52.164
Gerald Giraffe feels sad.

06:52.210 --> 06:54.178
The metadata indicates

06:54.210 --> 06:56.178
that Detective Prima deleted
the e-mail

06:56.210 --> 06:58.178
from the Canadian authorities,

06:58.210 --> 06:59.677
but he couldn't have.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.746
He was testifying
on the stand at the time.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.587
Okay...

07:04.620 --> 07:06.815
So, um, then I thought
it was maybe Geneva Pine,

07:06.860 --> 07:09.078
but actually
she was out of town

07:09.120 --> 07:10.678
at a prosecutors convention.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.449
Hey, Dora, you're about to spill
juice on the couch.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.718
I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, what
are you trying to say?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.728
Um, I'm saying
from what I could ascertain,

07:17.770 --> 07:19.738
Detective Prima never
deleted the e-mail.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.465
Uh, no one did.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.459
Which means that somebody
altered the metadata

07:25.510 --> 07:27.705
after the fact to make it
look like he did.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.540
I'm saying you submitted
false evidence, Diane.

07:31.580 --> 07:32.740
Angry.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.749
Gerald Giraffe feels angry.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.181
I'll need you to
leave now, Mr. Wiley.

07:39.220 --> 07:43.088
If you have anything to say,
I'm closing my report.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.690
I need you to leave, Mr. Wiley.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.098
Let's go, kids.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.734
Come on.

07:52.770 --> 07:53.759
Come on, guys.

07:56.670 --> 07:57.864
Come on.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.865
Come on, Timmy.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.775
Let's go.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.628
Did you fake evidence?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.628
What?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.797
The metadata that
I submitted in court.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.969
The evidence
that said

08:28.340 --> 08:30.069
Did you alter it?

08:30.110 --> 08:33.079
Diane, let's...

08:33.110 --> 08:35.101
in here.

08:45.090 --> 08:48.082
*

08:52.160 --> 08:54.993
I never intended for
you to use It, Diane.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.190
I never gave it to you,
because I found another way

08:56.230 --> 08:58.824
to save Cary, but by
the time I got to court,

08:58.870 --> 09:00.167
you'd already found
it on my computer.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.758
Wiley knows.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.108
He's taking it to
the police board.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.232
I know, that's why
she came to me.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.238
And not to me?!
I told her
she couldn't,

09:06.270 --> 09:08.636
because it would put you
in a worse spot.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.079
So you just hoped it would pass?

09:10.110 --> 09:11.202
No, no, I
wanted...

09:11.250 --> 09:13.218
Kalinda, I need you
to not say anything.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.639
You'll both be questioned
as to what was said here.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.648
Now, Diane, Kalinda intends to
come clean about what she did,

09:17.690 --> 09:21.080
but we were trying
to find a way not to...

09:21.120 --> 09:23.281
not to hurt you.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.185
This is a disbarrable
offense for me.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.118
I know.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.828
DAVID: ...to take long.
I've got...

09:38.870 --> 09:40.269
Then tell him
he's done.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.130
Tell him it's over.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.738
What is it, Diane?

09:43.780 --> 09:45.668
We_ submitted _false evidence
In Cary's crImInal case.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.019
What?

09:48.050 --> 09:49.813
The metadata showing that
Detective Prima deleted

09:49.850 --> 09:51.613
his e-mail,
it was faked.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.618
Kalinda hacked into
the CPD's server...

09:53.660 --> 09:55.252
DAVID: Wait, what?
Stop, Diane.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.257
She did what?

09:56.290 --> 09:57.518
DAVID:
No, don't answer that.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.120
None of us have attorney-client
privilege with you on this,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.321
so every word you say
puts us all in jeopardy.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.998
DIANE: The firm is
already in jeopardy.

10:04.030 --> 10:05.258
The evidence
was faked?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.858
Cary, stop it.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.868
This is about the Internal
Affairs investigation

10:08.900 --> 10:11.164
into Prima, right?
Yes.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.678
Then you have to go
before the Police Review Board.

10:13.710 --> 10:16.679
You and Kalinda admit
the error.
CARY:
And clear Prima?

10:16.710 --> 10:18.803
If this is true,
he didn't do anything wrong.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.841
They tried to frame me with
an altered interrogation tape.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.279
I agree with David.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.289
We open up our books
and admit to everything.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.117
It's the only way we can
nip this in the bud.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.084
It might be the only way
you don't end up in jail.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.423
Madam State's Attorney, the
pride of the Democratic Party.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.121
Congratulations!

10:36.160 --> 10:38.060
Oh, thank you, Mr. Landau.
Oh, that's great.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.330
And you must be...
Marissa.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.133
Alicia's _
executive aSSIstant.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.137
So very nice to meet you.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.159
Well, come on in!

10:44.210 --> 10:46.030
Have a seat, have some popcorn,

10:46.070 --> 10:48.231
the official snack food
of the State of Illinois.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.804
I didn't know we had
an official snack food.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.169
We do!

10:51.210 --> 10:53.212
General Assembly voted on it
back in 2003.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.741
It was between popcorn
and potato chips.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.987
So, I know
why you're here.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.817
This silly investigation.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.317
Unfortunately, I don't think
it is so silly, Mr. Landau.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.987
Well, don't worry.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.452
You won't have any trouble
with the election board.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.094
Believe me, we are putting

11:07.130 --> 11:08.825
all our talents
behind you, Mrs. Florrick.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.293
Well, I'm flattered, but...

11:10.330 --> 11:12.469
this evidence,
this-this hacking device...

11:12.500 --> 11:13.933
it is a problem.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.289
MAN:
In other words...

11:15.340 --> 11:17.831
she doesn't want
comforting words, Frank.

11:17.870 --> 11:20.907
She is a woman
of action.

11:20.940 --> 11:23.374
We must earn her faith.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.179
Oh, my God, it's you.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.370
Yes. Wow. Hi.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.478
It is truly an honor...

11:28.520 --> 11:30.488
sir.
Thank you.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.987
Spencer has volunteered

11:32.020 --> 11:33.282
to represent you
before the election board.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.912
SPENCER:
Elections need to be over!

11:34.960 --> 11:36.257
At some point,
they need to be done.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.928
D l
on t you agree, ma'am?

11:37.960 --> 11:39.257
Yes, I do.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.757
Oh, you mean Alicia.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.926
Yes, I agree.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.089
And even if I didn't, I would
volunteer to represent you

11:47.140 --> 11:50.769
because I am tired of living
in a corrupt Cook County.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.176
An election result
that is constantly

11:53.210 --> 11:54.837
questioned and revised

11:54.880 --> 11:57.348
is an election result
that I can't trust,

11:57.380 --> 11:59.268
and that is why
I am here to help,

11:59.310 --> 12:00.971
if you will let me.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.942
Thank you, Mr. Randolph.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.389
Please.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.342
(nervous laugh)

12:10.460 --> 12:12.792
"Will, I need you.

12:12.830 --> 12:16.288
I need you on top of me."

12:16.330 --> 12:18.321
"Alicia, meet me after work,

12:18.370 --> 12:21.294
at the hotel."

12:21.340 --> 12:23.865
"Will, sometimes,
I worry this is wrong,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.935
you being my boss."

12:25.970 --> 12:27.301
"I know.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.035
"But I can't get you
out of my head.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.298
"The touch of you, the taste!

12:31.350 --> 12:33.113
I need you tonight."

12:33.150 --> 12:34.811
"Isn't that a song?

12:34.850 --> 12:36.112
"'Need You Tonight.‘

12:36.150 --> 12:37.412
"LOL.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.987
God, I'm horny."

12:40.020 --> 12:41.419
"You were away
at depos this week,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.348
"and all I could think about
was your hands on me.

12:43.390 --> 12:47.326
Sometimes this feels
too dangerous."

12:47.360 --> 12:51.569
"Will, I had a crazy dream
about you last night.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.831
Details later. Happy face."

12:54.870 --> 12:56.838
"Alicia, last night
was amazing.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.839
"You leave me exhausted.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.508
I slept like a baby.
Dot, dot, dot."

13:12.590 --> 13:15.184
Look, Cary, I was
worried about you.

13:15.220 --> 13:18.155
You were going to prison,
and... and it wasn't right.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.294
That's why I did it.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.195
Make me your lavwer, Kalinda.

13:24.230 --> 13:25.322
Let me fight this for you.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.564
No, Cary. I...

13:26.600 --> 13:28.090
Finn's doing it.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.960
I'll do it better.
No, you won't.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.262
You care. I...

13:32.310 --> 13:34.369
I need somebody
who doesn't care.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.271
They dismissed the charges

13:38.310 --> 13:40.175
because of what you did
for me, Kalinda.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.972
No.
Yes.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.419
Cary, they knew Prima

13:43.450 --> 13:45.213
_ doctored the
interrogation tape.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.218
Geneva was ready
to drop the charge.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.320
No, it was a combination
of that and the deleted e-mail.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.351
The two got me released.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.320
Let me be your lawyer.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.291
No.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.594
But thanks, though.

14:03.470 --> 14:05.563
I'll be fine.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.498
PARILLO: It's true,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.337
Only one hacking device
has been found

14:09.380 --> 14:11.143
in a voting machine-- so far.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.943
So you think there are more.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.278
I think it's clear someone was
trying to steal this election.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.446
And to do that,
they would have had

14:16.480 --> 14:17.879
to hack a lot of other machines.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.239
And what action, Mr. Parillo,

14:19.290 --> 14:21.087
are you asking
the board to take?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.212
A canvass of all
voting machines

14:22.260 --> 14:23.522
in precincts where
the reported results

14:23.560 --> 14:25.380
differ by more
than four points

14:25.430 --> 14:27.091
from the
predicted results.

14:28.930 --> 14:30.898
Four points is
a questionable enough...

14:30.930 --> 14:33.535
deviation,
given the margins of error

14:33.570 --> 14:36.232
some of these polls...

14:36.270 --> 14:37.908
Lean in, and I'll whisper
something to you.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.100
We're talking
about thousands

14:39.140 --> 14:40.402
of potentially
disenfranchised voters.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.408
(whispering):
Now we should hug each other.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.044
PARILLO: May I call
my first witness, please?

14:47.020 --> 14:49.375
May I, please, panelists?
Oh, yes, yes, please.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.218
Let's start with this cluster
right here.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.651
Two precincts in Proviso,
one in Oak Park

14:55.690 --> 14:58.022
and Berwyn.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.652
These are all _
close together phy5ically,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.920
so the hackers
could change the votes

15:01.960 --> 15:03.359
from a centralized location.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.062
Now, all of this
was consistently predicted

15:06.100 --> 15:08.295
to go to Prady
by at least four points.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.059
So, in each of
those precincts,

15:11.110 --> 15:13.328
there was a seven-point swing--
sometimes more--

15:13.380 --> 15:15.109
from what the polls
were showing?

15:15.140 --> 15:16.539
WITNESS:
And I found a number
of other areas...

15:16.580 --> 15:18.047
SPENCER:
Statistics are nonsense.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.311
Shiny nonsense,
but nonsense nonetheless.

15:21.350 --> 15:22.476
Don't worry.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.680
WITNESS:
No, no and no.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.347
PARILLO: So, would
the number of votes

15:25.390 --> 15:26.345
from these
outlier precmcts

15:26.390 --> 15:28.517
have been enough to change
who won the election?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.357
Absolutely.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.379
Nothing further.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.125
I tender the witness.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.288
Ah, well, thank you
for tendering, sir.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.399
(chuckling)

15:37.430 --> 15:39.193
This isn't a court of law,

15:39.230 --> 15:40.367
Mr. Parillo.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.537
The usual formalities
don't apply.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.709
So...

15:43.740 --> 15:46.061
Mr. Zubrovslq,

15:46.110 --> 15:48.203
you know the old saying,

15:48.240 --> 15:51.073
politicians use statistics
like drunks use lampposts—-

15:51.110 --> 15:53.340
more for support
than illumination?

15:53.380 --> 15:55.268
(chuckling)
ZUBROVSKY: That's very funny.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.311
Untutored but very funny.

15:57.350 --> 15:58.681
Well, yes and no,
because sometimes

15:58.720 --> 16:01.359
even the best pollsters
get elections dead wrong,

16:01.390 --> 16:02.254
isn't that right?

16:02.290 --> 16:03.587
Has it happened? Yes.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.281
During the last
presidential election--

16:06.330 --> 16:08.457
one of the most heavily
covered political events

16:08.500 --> 16:11.298
in history-- they consistently
had Mitt Romney

16:11.330 --> 16:13.639
leading Barack Obama.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.297
They did.
Even to the last day
of the election.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.433
Romney plus one--

16:17.470 --> 16:20.405
that's what all
their models said.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.702
But the actual tally was?

16:21.740 --> 16:22.570
Obama plus four.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.306
Their methodology was off;
mine wasn't.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.648
That's right, you did get
the Prady/Florrick race

16:27.680 --> 16:29.318
almost perfect,

16:29.350 --> 16:32.080
but weren't there certain
precmcts that you

16:32.120 --> 16:35.453
thought went to Mrs. Florrick
but actually went to Prady?

16:36.690 --> 16:38.749
I did not screen for those.

16:38.790 --> 16:42.226
SPENCER:
Well, fortunately, we did.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.694
And we found 14 precincts

16:44.730 --> 16:49.394
where Prady outperformed
his expected total vote by...

16:49.440 --> 16:51.135
four points.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.676
(whispers):
I want to marry him.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.178
Detective Prima could not have
deleted the e-mail,

16:58.210 --> 17:00.713
nor could anyone else connected
with the case have done so.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.344
Furthermore, certain
discrepancies in the metadata

17:03.390 --> 17:06.780
indicated a high probability
that it was, in fact, altered.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.458
Falsified.
And did you determine

17:08.490 --> 17:09.684
who had altered
the metadata?

17:09.720 --> 17:10.823
Definitively, no.

17:10.860 --> 17:12.828
But all my evidence points

17:12.860 --> 17:14.828
to it being someone connected
with Mr. Agos'

17:14.860 --> 17:17.499
law firm, as they were
the ones submitting

17:17.530 --> 17:19.623
the falsified evidence
to the court.
I see.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.092
The witness is excused.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.334
Actually, ifI may?

17:22.370 --> 17:23.837
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Finn Polmar.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.599
I'm here on behalf
of Kalinda Sharma,

17:25.640 --> 17:27.176
of Mr. Agos' law firm.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.700
And I'm here on behalf
of Diane Lockhart,

17:28.740 --> 17:29.729
senior partner.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.771
Before this committee
decides on this matter,

17:31.810 --> 17:33.619
we'd like to be heard.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.675
Well, I'm sorry, but you
haven't been subpoenaed

17:35.720 --> 17:38.746
or called by anyone connected
with this case...

17:38.790 --> 17:41.350
Yes, and I know how
valuable your time must be.

17:41.390 --> 17:44.826
We have information that will
serve to clear Detective Prima.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.179
SM ETKOVICH :
What information?

17:46.230 --> 17:48.528
Members of the Board.
I am Diane Lockhart,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.391
and this is Kalinda Sharma.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.762
And, uh,

17:52.800 --> 17:54.495
yes, it is true.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.306
I submitted false evidence
to the court,

17:58.340 --> 18:01.377
for which I apologize to you

18:01.410 --> 18:02.877
and to Detective Prima.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.549
It's a little late now,
isn't it?

18:05.580 --> 18:07.309
I, uh, Ijust want to be clear

18:07.350 --> 18:12.708
that Diane had no idea that
the evidence was falsified.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.457
It was entirely my doing.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.754
I never intended
to use it.

18:17.790 --> 18:19.781
And in fact,
we found another way...

18:30.470 --> 18:32.438
(Geneva speaks indistinctly)

18:32.470 --> 18:34.279
Let's talk later.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.335
We can't be seeing each other.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.677
They faked that evidence
against me.

18:37.710 --> 18:38.779
What?

18:38.810 --> 18:40.277
Kalinda. Her law firm.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.514
They framed me.

18:41.550 --> 18:42.778
How do you know?

18:42.820 --> 18:44.117
They just admitted it to IAD.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.356
Grace?

18:51.390 --> 18:53.927
Hey.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.359
Hi.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.799
Is everything okay?

18:56.830 --> 18:59.219
Yeah.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.801
I'm sorry you have to deal
with all this stuff.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.705
My stuff.

19:06.740 --> 19:08.605
It's okay.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.714
(sighs)

19:15.550 --> 19:17.347
Mom?

19:17.390 --> 19:18.812
Yeah?

19:19.990 --> 19:22.208
Was it just a flirtation?

19:22.260 --> 19:24.785
With Will?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.891
No.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.522
It wasn't.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.790
So you lied?

19:32.870 --> 19:35.361
Yes.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.539
Because?

19:37.570 --> 19:39.606
Because it's_ none
of their busmess.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.904
That's okay?

19:42.910 --> 19:45.208
Yes.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.218
I have to go do my homework.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.717
Wait, Grace.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.445
Give me a hug.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.557
SPENCER:
Mrs. Florrick, thank you
for taking time out

19:58.590 --> 20:00.490
to answer questions today.
You're welcome.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.929
Were you aware of any corruption
in your campaign?

20:01.960 --> 20:04.326
No, not at all.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.395
No involvement,
directly or indirectly,

20:06.430 --> 20:09.365
in anything that could be
construed as voter fraud?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.766
Not even close.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.505
I wouldn't stand for it,
and it didn't happen.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.269
Thank you.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.369
You've been
most understanding today.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.370
(whispers):
Do you want some popcorn?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.910
(whispers):
No, thank you.
PARILLO: Mrs. Florrick,

20:22.950 --> 20:24.315
on the morning
of your election,
I'm fine.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.339
do you remember
a television interview

20:25.390 --> 20:27.608
your husband did
with Mandy Post?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.878
We did many interviews.
Let me refresh
your recollection.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.922
In this one, your husband,
our governor,

20:31.960 --> 20:33.894
said, and I quote,

20:33.930 --> 20:35.989
"As far as I'm concerned,

20:36.030 --> 20:40.023
"you can take it to the bank,
Alicia Florrick

20:40.070 --> 20:42.265
is going to be the next state's
attorney for Cook County."

20:42.300 --> 20:44.404
I appreciated his optimism.
I'm sure,

20:44.440 --> 20:47.034
but shouldn't we be concerned
about his certainty?

20:47.070 --> 20:48.537
He was being supportive.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.535
Or predictive.
He was reading

20:49.580 --> 20:51.047
the same polls
as everyone else.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.547
But Peter wasn't just reading
the polls, was he?

20:52.580 --> 20:53.945
I think I answered that.

20:53.980 --> 20:57.939
Are you familiar with
the Help America Vote Act?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.343
Vaguely.

20:59.390 --> 21:00.459
Let me fill you in.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.458
It's a program where
states get money

21:02.490 --> 21:04.287
to buy and maintain
voting machines,

21:04.330 --> 21:06.719
money that goes directly
to each state's governor.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.625
So Peter had control

21:08.660 --> 21:10.059
over what machines
were purchased,

21:10.100 --> 21:12.295
where they were stored,
how they were maintained.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.695
Can you see my
cause for concern,

21:13.740 --> 21:15.628
when your husband
was in charge

21:15.670 --> 21:17.638
of safeguarding the
very voting machines

21:17.670 --> 21:19.308
which wound up handing
you this election?

21:19.340 --> 21:22.377
I'm not sure
what you're asking me.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.048
Ladies and gentlemen,
there are strong indications

21:26.080 --> 21:28.878
that this election
was undermined

21:28.920 --> 21:31.411
by serious and systematic fraud,

21:31.450 --> 21:33.816
with help potentially
from the highest levels.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.714
But the only way
we can find out for sure

21:35.760 --> 21:38.354
is to conduct
a full canvass

21:38.390 --> 21:40.392
of all the machines in
the suspect precmcts.

21:45.770 --> 21:48.091
Can you excuse us?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.358
Did you try to help me
win the election?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.934
No.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.438
Did you try to help me win
the election by cheating?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.334
(scoffs)
Are you serious?

21:56.380 --> 21:57.745
They brought up
the Help America Vote Act,

21:57.780 --> 21:59.407
said you were in control
of the voting machines.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.111
I don't control the
voting machines.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.072
I don't get anywhere
near the voting machines.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.111
I knew I had to
stay clear of them,

22:05.150 --> 22:07.948
which is why I appointed
an independent monitor.

22:07.990 --> 22:10.117
Now, if you want
to know more,

22:10.160 --> 22:11.525
go talk to him.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.982
VVho?
Ernie Nolan.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.754
What?

22:16.800 --> 22:18.768
He tried to bribe me
before I ran.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.769
Well, that's not good.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.802
It has nothing
to do with me.

22:27.810 --> 22:31.769
ALICIA: So you oversee the Help
America Vote program for Peter,

22:31.810 --> 22:34.370
but you're totally
independent?

22:34.420 --> 22:36.445
If you're worried I threw the
election to you, don't be.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.414
Good.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.644
Will you testify
to that effect?

22:39.690 --> 22:41.055
No.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.079
Why not?

22:44.160 --> 22:46.526
When you were contemplating
running, Mrs. Florrick,

22:46.560 --> 22:49.529
I offered to help you, but
you weren't interested.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.118
So why would I
help you now?

22:53.170 --> 22:57.539
Anyway, I found Prady's men
much more open to donations.

22:57.570 --> 23:00.630
You donated
to Prady's campaign?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.806
Yes.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.445
You_ controlled
the voting machines,

23:04.480 --> 23:06.038
and you gave
to Prady's campaign?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.116
No comment.

23:11.150 --> 23:14.586
You put this hacking device
in the machines for Prady?

23:16.190 --> 23:18.488
(chuckles)

23:26.230 --> 23:28.437
But Prady lost.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.802
Yes, because your campaign
cheated better than his.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.967
We didn't cheat.
Well, good.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.001
Then this recount should
put things right.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.849
You should have
taken my money.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.769
'Cause now you
won't be SA.

23:52.130 --> 23:55.190
PARILLO: You are the chairman
of Help America Vote, Mr. Nolan?
Yes, I am.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.095
PARILLO: And you canvassed
the touchscreen voting machines

23:57.130 --> 23:58.620
in Cook County?
NOLAN: Yes.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.467
PARILLO: And did you
find any more

24:00.500 --> 24:03.162
of these hacking devices, these
"man in the middle" devices?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.167
I did.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.529
Forty.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.037
40 devices.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.107
40 machines
compromised.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.700
Even if just a couple of hundred
votes were changed in each,

24:12.750 --> 24:14.547
that would be more than
enough for Mrs. Florrick

24:14.580 --> 24:16.810
to steal
this election.
That is correct.

24:16.850 --> 24:20.559
So you would advocate for
a recount in those precincts?

24:20.590 --> 24:21.818
Of course I would.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.555
Thank you, sir.

24:23.590 --> 24:27.151
Mr. Nolan, in your meeting
this morning with Mrs. Florrick,

24:27.190 --> 24:29.590
did you say that you wouldn't
have swung the vote for her

24:29.630 --> 24:32.098
because she turned down a bribe
that you offered?

24:32.130 --> 24:33.791
Excuse me?
Shall I repeat
the question?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.899
No, I did not.
You didn't suggest

24:35.940 --> 24:39.535
that if the recount
is approved,

24:39.570 --> 24:42.175
the vote would swing to Prady
through your machinations?

24:42.210 --> 24:45.998
No.
You didn't say these words:
"You should have taken my money.

24:46.050 --> 24:47.870
Now you won't be S.A."?
I said

24:47.920 --> 24:49.547
no such thing.
As a matter of fact,

24:49.580 --> 24:52.743
it was Mrs. Florrick who dragged
me back to her office,

24:52.790 --> 24:55.884
where she hoped to pay me off
so I'd advise against a recount.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.718
My goodness. Is that
true, Mrs. Florrick?

24:58.760 --> 25:01.126
Did you really say that?
PARILLO:
Uh, put her under oath.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.765
Then ask her.
This isn't a court of law,
is it, Mr. Boxer?

25:03.800 --> 25:04.789
It is not.
Well, let's have

25:04.830 --> 25:05.899
Mrs. Florrick take the stand.

25:05.930 --> 25:07.659
Let's hear what she has to say.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.668
Please.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.907
Good morning,
Mrs. State's Attorney.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.272
Good morning, Mr. Randolph.
Are Mr. N_olan's
accusations

25:14.310 --> 25:16.631
against you true?
No.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.648
They are categorically false.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.614
(scoffs)
Hey.
KEN: Okay. Can we all

25:20.650 --> 25:21.844
keep the comments
to ourselves?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.643
SPENCER:
But isn't this

25:23.690 --> 25:25.089
a classic he-said-she—said,
ma'am?

25:25.120 --> 25:26.917
No.
Why?

25:26.950 --> 25:28.156
Why is that?
Why should this panel

25:28.190 --> 25:29.987
take you at your word,
Mrs. Florrick?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.578
Because I recorded the meeting.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.599
Objection. Your Honor,
this is beyond the pale.

25:34.630 --> 25:37.190
Well, perhaps Mr. Parillo
can specify how this

25:37.230 --> 25:39.721
is beyond the pale.
It is a secret wiretap.

25:39.770 --> 25:42.568
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but a one-person consent

25:42.600 --> 25:45.569
has been held constitutional
by the Illinois Supreme Court.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.874
People v. Clark.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.605
Mr. Parillo?

25:51.810 --> 25:53.710
SPENCER:
Thank you. So...

25:53.750 --> 25:56.048
do you have the recording
with you?
I do.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.889
Ah, how resourceful of you.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.047
Shall we hear it?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.178
NOLAN:
When you were contemplating
running, Mrs. Florrick,

26:04.230 --> 26:06.790
I offered to help you.
But you weren't interested.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.219
So why would I help you now?

26:09.260 --> 26:13.731
Anyway, I found Prady's men
much more open to donations.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.692
(door opens)
SPENCER: Yes, I can
understand why he doesn't want

26:15.740 --> 26:18.607
to hear it.
ALICIA:
You donated to Prady's campaign?

26:18.640 --> 26:20.232
NOLAN: Yes.
You controlled
the voting machines

26:20.270 --> 26:21.976
and you gave
to Prady's campaign?

26:22.010 --> 26:23.807
NOLAN:
No comment.
Gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.671
Uh, I am as outraged
by this as anyone.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.917
This proves that the chairman
of Help America Vote,

26:28.950 --> 26:31.942
the organization that maintains
the voting machines, is corrupt.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.709
There has to be a recount.
Not if Mrs. Florrick
is blameless.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.751
Blame isn't the issue.
JusUceis.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.953
The people deserve
election results they can trust.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.249
KEN: _
Is there anything else,

26:42.300 --> 26:44.666
Mr. Randolph?

26:44.700 --> 26:48.329
(phone buzzing)

26:48.370 --> 26:51.760
Alicia, I think
we might have something for you.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.971
I need a better picture,
Kalinda.
Howell, I thought you said

26:54.010 --> 26:55.807
you were certain.
Are you or aren't you?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.671
I'm certain.
But I need a better picture.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.746
Look, the hacking device.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.179
Howell had a look at it.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.848
Uh, there's something odd.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.017
GLA'I'I':
The Cary Agos case.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.883
There've been more remakes
of this case than Spider-Man.
The case

27:08.920 --> 27:11.081
was dismissed based on
fabricated evidence, Your Honor.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.859
No, Your Honor, it was a case
brought on trumped-up charges.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.755
At its best, Your Honor,
this was an invidious effort

27:14.800 --> 27:16.756
by Ms. Lockhart
to undermine the credibility

27:16.800 --> 27:20.224
of a decorated
Chicago police detective.
A detective who pressured

27:20.270 --> 27:22.067
a witness to testify against me.
At its worst,

27:22.100 --> 27:23.260
it's obstruction
of justice,

27:23.300 --> 27:25.302
and I ask your leave
to bring charges

27:25.340 --> 27:26.739
against Ms. Lockhart.
An unfounded
charge on top

27:26.770 --> 27:28.203
of a trumped-up charge.
The hypocrisy

27:28.240 --> 27:29.377
is really quite exquisite.

27:29.410 --> 27:31.207
I'm the arbiter
of this exquisiteness,

27:31.250 --> 27:34.378
Mr. Polmar. Now, ASA Pine,

27:34.420 --> 27:37.378
Ms. Lockhart could
be facing three years

27:37.420 --> 27:40.719
in prison. So take
me through it.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.115
Your Honor, Ms. Lockhart
submitted metadata

27:43.160 --> 27:45.355
from the Chicago Police
computer system,

27:45.390 --> 27:48.359
accusing Detective Prima
of knowingly deleting an e-mail

27:48.400 --> 27:50.356
that pointed
to Cary Agos' innocence.
Ms. Lockhart had no way

27:50.400 --> 27:52.265
of knowing the metadata
was amended.
Not amended.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.336
Faked._
It was qUIte
simply,

27:54.370 --> 27:56.463
Your Honor, a mistake.
A mistake

27:56.500 --> 28:00.231
Ms. Lockhart herself would not
tolerate from a paralegal.

28:00.270 --> 28:01.908
POLMAR:
Objection, Your Honor.
Your objection pales

28:01.940 --> 28:04.977
next to mine, Mr. Polmar.
If Ms. Pine's allegation

28:05.010 --> 28:07.979
is true,
it is beyond inexcusable.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.976
But...
No. That's enough.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.319
I will hear on these arguments
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

28:13.350 --> 28:16.319
Dear God, I need a drink.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.386
(sighs)
Okay, well, we're
officially the bad guys.

28:19.430 --> 28:23.218
Not we. I am.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.469
What do you
want, Ms. Pine?
Want?

28:28.500 --> 28:31.230
You went after one
lawyer and lost.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.067
Now you're going
after another.

28:33.110 --> 28:35.908
It's always a prom
for something.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.908
So what do you want?

28:37.950 --> 28:39.872
SPENCER:
Mr. Howell, hi.

28:39.910 --> 28:43.118
Hi.
There's no microphone, sir.
You can just talk to me.

28:43.150 --> 28:46.347
Oh. I'm sorry. Uh, hi.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.857
Sir, did you have an
opportunity to examine

28:47.890 --> 28:49.778
this microprocessor

28:49.820 --> 28:53.529
taken from one of the 40
compromised voting machines?
Uh, I did.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.121
A photo of it. Th-Then
over there, I examined it.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.969
When I got here.
And what

28:59.000 --> 29:00.399
were you able to ascertain?

29:00.430 --> 29:02.364
The technology's from 2012.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.402
SPENCER: And is there more
recent technology available?
Oh, yeah.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.806
Lots. This stuff
is anCIent.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.832
Things turn around
twice a year now.
So in your expert opinion,

29:09.880 --> 29:13.407
was this hacking device used
in this election?

29:13.450 --> 29:15.338
Well, that'd be dumb.

29:15.380 --> 29:18.178
Y-You'd update it.
This is from 2012.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.211
SPENCER:
Mr. Zubrovslq,

29:20.250 --> 29:23.151
have you examined the election
results of the 2012 election?

29:23.190 --> 29:24.828
Yes.
Have you come

29:24.860 --> 29:27.226
to any conclusions?
Yes, there was
a very large swing

29:27.260 --> 29:28.898
in the predicted
polling data

29:28.930 --> 29:31.421
from the 2012 election.
Even larger

29:31.470 --> 29:33.358
than the recent race?
Yes.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.460
Now, you're speaking
of the governor's race?

29:36.500 --> 29:38.468
Yes.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.398
Peter Florrick stealing
an election.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.305
PARILLO: Objection.
KEN: I know we're
not a court of law,

29:42.340 --> 29:44.069
but I'll still advise
you, Mr. Randolph,

29:44.110 --> 29:46.146
not to speculate so wildly.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.875
Yes, sir.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.946
You didn't tell me you
were going after Peter.

29:52.020 --> 29:55.387
I'm going after Peter.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.218
Dad's not
gonna be happy.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.827
GENEVA:
I've consulted with the
outgoing state's attorney.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.395
Oh. Would that be State's
Attorney James Castro,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.567
who wrongfully charged me?
Cary.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.172
At my request, he's authorizing
all charges against Ms. Lockhart

30:14.210 --> 30:15.472
be dropped.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.905
(exhales)

30:17.950 --> 30:19.872
Thank you.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.343
But the price will be high.
We wouldn't

30:21.380 --> 30:23.177
expect otherwise.
Off the record,

30:23.220 --> 30:26.041
I can't condone Castro's tactics

30:26.090 --> 30:28.058
in going after you, Cary.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.512
But the larger
intent was sincere

30:29.560 --> 30:32.358
and more than justified.

30:32.390 --> 30:35.188
Six months ago, we
offered Cary a deal.

30:35.230 --> 30:38.495
We would drop all charges if he
testified against Lemond Bishop.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.498
Oh, no.
Diane, we
will drop

30:40.530 --> 30:44.899
all charges against you if you
testify against Lemond Bishop.

30:44.940 --> 30:48.068
(chuckles)

30:48.110 --> 30:50.601
And here we are, back again.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.848
Right at the beginning.

31:03.190 --> 31:06.387
CARY:
Judge Glatt
was right.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.126
It is like watching
a remake of Spider-Man.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.958
Except the evidence
against you was tenuous.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.389
The evidence here is ironclad.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.396
There must be something else
we can offer Geneva.
Well,

31:16.440 --> 31:19.136
I worked in that office,
and Bishop could cure cancer

31:19.170 --> 31:21.638
and wipe out world hunger,
and they'd still want him.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.205
Finn, could you give us
a minute, please?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.400
Yeah.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.082
Can't.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.951
I know.

31:37.460 --> 31:41.226
I spent six months
looking over my shoulder.

31:41.260 --> 31:44.263
You really want to go
through life like that?

31:55.710 --> 31:57.940
"Did Peter Florrick
steal an election?

31:57.980 --> 32:00.403
"In battling charges of voter
fraud, Alicia Florrick's lavwer

32:00.450 --> 32:03.112
"claimed the devices at issue
dated from her husband's race

32:03.150 --> 32:04.447
three years earlier."

32:04.490 --> 32:06.139
I didn't know.
That your lavwer was

32:06.190 --> 32:08.010
going to throw me
under the bus to save you?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.016
He's not my lavwer;
the party gave him to me.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.482
Eli?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.452
Sir, you do not micromanage
Spencer Randolph.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.094
Eli, I can't have this.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.199
It won't stick.

32:16.230 --> 32:17.299
It's a dated charge, unprovable.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.661
And your administration

32:18.700 --> 32:21.089
has been unimpeachable.
Until Randolph impeached it.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.562
So you're saying I shouldn't
have fought back?
No.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.136
Either we're a team,
or we're not.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.638
Don't let him divide us.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.177
on Mrs. Florrick's behalf
aren't appreciated.

32:30.210 --> 32:31.302
They are.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.272
Thank you, Mr. Gold.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.119
Now that you've
buttered me up,

32:35.150 --> 32:37.118
why don't you tell me
what's on your mind?

32:37.150 --> 32:40.017
We need you to back down
from the Peter accusation.

32:40.050 --> 32:41.517
Back down?

32:41.560 --> 32:43.448
Defending Mrs. Florrick
by attacking her husband--

32:43.490 --> 32:44.650
there has to be a better way.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.555
There's not.
I disagree.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.128
Is this your wish
or your handler's?

32:52.170 --> 32:54.434
It's my wish.
That's too bad.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.665
I'm not here to defend you,
Mrs. Florrick.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.306
I'm here to_ defend
the democratic process.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.671
I'm here to defend...

33:01.710 --> 33:04.247
...a hero.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.578
We cast our eyes
far and wide for them,

33:06.610 --> 33:11.081
but sometimes the most
her0ic people live amongst us.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.089
Heroes like Alicia Florrick.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.715
A woman who watched
her husband go to jail.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.228
Who stood by him
until he was vindicated.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.093
Who worked her way
up the legal ladder.

33:23.130 --> 33:26.293
Whose story of courage
and commitment so affected

33:26.330 --> 33:29.231
and inspired the people
of Cook County

33:29.270 --> 33:33.206
that they chose to elect her
to watch over all of them

33:33.240 --> 33:35.629
as their champion.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.309
But people smell blood
in the water now.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.239
Party functionaries
like Mr. Ernie Nolan,

33:42.280 --> 33:44.714
who turned against her
with outrageous lies

33:44.750 --> 33:46.240
because he saw weakness.

33:46.290 --> 33:49.612
But there is no weakness
in Alicia Florrick.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.252
There is only strength.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.554
Strength to fight
for what she has earned.

33:53.590 --> 33:54.557
And that is why

33:54.600 --> 33:56.397
I will not back down.

33:56.430 --> 33:59.263
And I know that this panel
will not back down either.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.735
PARILLO:
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.761
I'd like leave
to recall a Witness.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.230
Do you need more time,
Mr. Howell?

34:10.280 --> 34:12.339
No. I'm up to speed.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.177
Could you please tell us
what you've reviewed?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.744
Yeah, um, this is a printout

34:15.780 --> 34:18.214
of the software specs

34:18.250 --> 34:20.218
on the hacking device.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.717
And what can you tell us
about the software?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.352
That it was remotely updated
via Wi-Fi connection

34:23.390 --> 34:25.187
approximately two months ago.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.255
Just prior to the election
for state's attorney.

34:27.290 --> 34:28.222
It would appear so.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.751
Would you care to amend
your earlier testimony

34:30.800 --> 34:33.724
that the hacking devices
have lain dormant since 2012?

34:33.770 --> 34:36.659
Yes. It appears I, uh...

34:36.700 --> 34:38.338
H was mistaken.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.600
Given this testimony, the panel
must approve recounts for

34:40.640 --> 34:43.575
all 40 of the precincts where
the hacking devices were found.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.312
You're thinking of
doing something, aren't you?

34:52.350 --> 34:53.612
What are you
talking about?

34:53.650 --> 34:56.380
I'm talking about
Geneva's offer.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.479
I can see the wheels turning.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.499
Cary...
You turn evidence
against Bishop,

35:01.530 --> 35:03.350
he will kill you.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.668
LANDAU:
Things aren't going well

35:12.710 --> 35:14.337
with the election board.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.530
It's a momentary setback, but
we're ready for a recount.

35:16.580 --> 35:19.378
We can't have a recount.
We think it'll just
make the count even tighter,

35:19.410 --> 35:20.638
but Alicia
will triumph.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.842
Mrs. Florrick,
I'm afraid we're gonna

35:23.880 --> 35:25.518
have to ask you to step down.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.351
What do you mean?

35:30.860 --> 35:32.384
We need you to withdraw.

35:32.430 --> 35:36.389
Mr. Landau, I'm not a cheater.

35:36.430 --> 35:39.319
We know that.
What's going on,
Frank?

35:39.370 --> 35:42.339
Alicia had nothing to do
with the the hacking devices.
We know that.

35:42.370 --> 35:45.430
But Mrs. Florrick wasn't
the only name on the ballot.

35:45.470 --> 35:47.438
There were other tough races.
Tilden's, for example.

35:47.470 --> 35:50.405
Oh, my...
Who was in danger of losing
his state senate seat.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.908
Oh, my God.
If Tilden
lost his seat,

35:52.950 --> 35:54.577
we would have lost
our supermajority

35:54.620 --> 35:56.269
in the state senate.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.289
The Republicans would've
been able to filibuster.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.959
You see now why
we need you to withdraw?

36:01.990 --> 36:04.185
No, I don't.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.188
If the recount goes through,

36:07.230 --> 36:09.494
it draws attention
to Tilden's win.

36:09.530 --> 36:10.849
So, the hacking device
was for Tilden?

36:13.330 --> 36:15.389
I can't comment on that.
I'm not withdrawing.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.358
but your sacrifice
will not go unnoticed.

36:20.410 --> 36:23.504
The party will make it up to you
in the next round.
There is no

36:23.540 --> 36:24.677
next round.
In politics,

36:24.710 --> 36:26.575
there is always a next round.

36:26.610 --> 36:28.669
A spot could come open
on the gaming commission...

36:28.720 --> 36:30.779
I didn't enter this race

36:30.820 --> 36:33.687
for a cushy spot
on some stupid commission.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.621
Well, if the gaming commission
doesn't interest you,

36:40.660 --> 36:43.959
take some time to think_ of a
post that would better swt you.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.631
And if I don't withdraw,
what happens then?

36:52.670 --> 36:54.934
You don't want to do that.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.302
Why?
Because the party
will destroy you.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.942
Or the party will hurt
the governorship.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.540
We all benefit
from a filibuster-proof

37:02.580 --> 37:04.480
majority.
You know that, Eli.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.511
Hal, can you
come in here, please?

37:06.550 --> 37:08.279
I have another meeting,

37:08.320 --> 37:09.958
so, Mrs. Florrick,
I'm gonna have to ask you

37:09.990 --> 37:11.548
to stand and open your purse.

37:11.590 --> 37:13.558
What?
Mrs. Florrick has
a way of recording

37:13.590 --> 37:15.558
her meetings.
Are you frisking us?

37:15.600 --> 37:17.727
We'll hold on to your cell phone
and get it back to you

37:17.760 --> 37:21.537
in 12 hours. The party
thanks you, Mrs. Florrick.

37:21.570 --> 37:24.437
Oh, my God.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.461
Did that just happen?

37:31.510 --> 37:33.307
Landau's all bark and no bite.
He confiscated my phone.

37:33.350 --> 37:36.569
I think we'd_be naive
to assume it's just bluster.

37:36.620 --> 37:37.973
No, I say you
force the issue.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.840
He threatened
the governorship.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.585
Well, call his bluff.

37:41.620 --> 37:44.384
You said that Randolph was
doing a fantastic job, right?

37:44.430 --> 37:47.558
He was.
Well, then let him continue
to fight the recount.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.524
This is a man who's
argued hundreds of cases,

37:49.560 --> 37:53.018
most of which have been probably
a lot harder than this one.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.833
The panel
is gonna make

37:54.870 --> 37:57.498
a decision on
the recoun_t tomorrow.
Do you believe in him?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.337
Do you think he can
turn it around?

37:59.370 --> 38:00.928
Of course.
Then get back
in front of that panel

38:00.970 --> 38:02.676
and let him win.

38:02.710 --> 38:06.077
I will. Thanks.

38:06.110 --> 38:08.317
(indistinct conversations)

38:18.890 --> 38:20.983
Has Kalinda approached you
about giving up Bishop?

38:21.030 --> 38:23.021
You know I'm not
at liberty...
Geneva.

38:25.030 --> 38:27.999
You and I worked together.

38:28.030 --> 38:29.930
Please.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.961
Has she approached you?

38:33.370 --> 38:34.837
No.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.531
Okay, when she does,

38:37.580 --> 38:39.104
turn her down.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.369
Is Diane gonna give me Bishop?
No, not Diane.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.411
Me.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.857
SPENCER:
Frank Landau

38:48.890 --> 38:51.108
asked you
to withdraw altogether.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.948
Well, that's a polite
way of putting it.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.558
Well, is that
what you want?

38:56.600 --> 38:58.659
No, I want to win.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.968
Okay.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.467
Let me handle it.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.967
Thank you.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.466
May I have the floor?

39:06.510 --> 39:08.899
Mr. Randolph, the panel's

39:08.940 --> 39:10.908
ready to render a decision.

39:10.940 --> 39:12.999
I believe that
what I have to say

39:13.050 --> 39:15.439
may have some bearing
on your decision.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.786
Go ahead.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.457
It has come to my attention

39:23.490 --> 39:27.119
that an egregious fraud has been
placed on these proceedings.

39:27.160 --> 39:31.051
Now, I have devoted my life
to righting wrongs,

39:31.100 --> 39:32.829
to fighting corruption
and collusion

39:32.870 --> 39:35.395
and all_ manner of ills
in the justice system.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.091
And therefore I am
compelled to speak out.

39:38.140 --> 39:40.108
I have just discovered
that Alicia Florrick

39:40.140 --> 39:42.506
has been lying to me
through these proceedings.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.100
It is my understanding
that the voting machines

39:45.150 --> 39:46.606
were hacked
under her direction.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.003
This is a lie!
KEN: Mrs. Florrick,

39:48.050 --> 39:50.575
please have a seat.
Mr. Randolph has the floor.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.679
In light of all of this,
I must not only

39:52.720 --> 39:53.914
side with Mr. Parillo,

39:53.950 --> 39:56.054
but I must encourage
Mrs. Florrick

39:56.090 --> 39:58.456
to step down in her role
as state's attorney.

39:58.490 --> 40:01.891
She has made a mockery
of these proceedings.

40:01.930 --> 40:05.422
She has committed the high crime
of stealing an election.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.995
_ She must never set foot_
in the state's attorney's office

40:08.030 --> 40:10.567
or any other political post,
for that matter.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.034
In my opinion,
Cook County

40:13.070 --> 40:15.903
of the City of Chicago
deserve more.

40:18.610 --> 40:19.872
I trusted you.

40:19.910 --> 40:23.744
I put my fate
in your hands.

40:23.780 --> 40:26.647
The man whose speeches

40:26.690 --> 40:28.612
I listened to and so admired...
Mrs. Florrick,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.719
I assure you,
this isn't personal.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.489
Like hell it isn't.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.883
Your problem can be
summed up in three words:

40:33.930 --> 40:36.649
two-thirds majority.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.691
Be a good Democrat,

40:38.730 --> 40:40.095
step down now.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.064
The party'll
take care of you.

40:42.100 --> 40:45.467
Everybody wins.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.501
Good day,
Mrs. Florrick.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.161
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

41:24.780 --> 41:26.771
