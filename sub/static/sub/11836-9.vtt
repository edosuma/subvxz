WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:02.468
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.037
His lawyer fell out,

00:04.070 --> 00:06.507
the case has already
been continued six times.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.641
What's the case?

00:07.674 --> 00:08.875
Statutory rape.

00:08.909 --> 00:09.843
I don't want it.

00:09.876 --> 00:10.844
I didn't ask.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.813
I never forced him.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.047
DONNELL: Mr. Orbis,

00:14.080 --> 00:15.649
he's 13 years old.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.750
I loved him.

00:16.783 --> 00:17.718
DONNELL: I have to attack

00:17.751 --> 00:20.053
a 13-year-old rape victim

00:20.086 --> 00:22.055
and I don't wanna do it.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.824
Well, you will.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.425
And if I tank it?

00:25.458 --> 00:26.927
Please,

00:26.960 --> 00:28.094
you don't think
I just pulled your name

00:28.128 --> 00:29.095
out of a hat.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.331
Do you take drugs, Justin?
All right.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.999
This is the accusing witness.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.234
Go ahead.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.670
DONNELL: After you were caught
with drugs, Justin,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.505
you got suspended then,
didn't you?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.239
Yes.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.607
And this is when...

00:40.641 --> 00:42.142
MARTIN: You hypocrite!

00:42.175 --> 00:44.745
You leave the church,
accusing us of enabling sex--

00:44.778 --> 00:45.746
There's a difference between--

00:45.779 --> 00:46.913
MARTIN: There's a difference?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.248
I was ordered
by the court!

00:48.281 --> 00:50.917
MARTIN: Then quit
your profession.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.753
MAN: We the jury
return a finding

00:52.786 --> 00:53.787
of not guilty.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.522
The defendant...

00:55.556 --> 00:57.190
is free to go.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.425
(gavel bangs)

00:59.459 --> 01:02.402
(indistinct chatter)

01:06.039 --> 01:07.240
I know you can beat this!

01:07.273 --> 01:09.142
Earl, trial is not

01:09.175 --> 01:10.644
an option here!

01:10.677 --> 01:11.778
You killed a cop!

01:11.812 --> 01:13.747
Who told me
he was a drug dealer?

01:13.780 --> 01:15.882
Because he was
working undercover

01:15.916 --> 01:17.483
and even if he was
a drug dealer,

01:17.518 --> 01:19.452
it's still murder
to shoot him!

01:19.485 --> 01:21.321
How many times
do I have to tell you

01:21.354 --> 01:22.556
it was an accident?!

01:22.589 --> 01:23.824
Are you stupid?

01:25.926 --> 01:28.294
Since your own lawyer
has trouble buying your story,

01:28.328 --> 01:30.263
you might consider
how hard it will be

01:30.296 --> 01:31.665
to convince a jury.

01:31.698 --> 01:32.766
You know what,
Mr. Jerk-off?

01:32.799 --> 01:34.034
Just defend me

01:34.067 --> 01:35.401
and while you're doing so,

01:35.435 --> 01:38.138
stop trying to pretend
that you're better than me.

01:38.171 --> 01:40.140
Your last client
was a child rapist,

01:40.173 --> 01:42.609
who you seemed
to have no problem getting off.

01:42.643 --> 01:45.078
Now, you do
what you need to, Bobby!

01:45.912 --> 01:48.081
Accuse the cop's widow.

01:48.114 --> 01:49.950
Argue that he shot himself.

01:49.983 --> 01:51.251
You can even stand up
and say,

01:51.284 --> 01:54.254
"You did it."
I don't much care.

01:54.287 --> 01:56.256
You can even argue accident

01:56.289 --> 01:57.658
because that is what it was.

01:57.691 --> 01:59.893
You listen to me.
No, you listen.

02:01.668 --> 02:05.138
I am the customer,
Bobby.

02:05.171 --> 02:06.607
Aside from that,

02:06.640 --> 02:08.542
you need to remember you and I

02:08.574 --> 02:10.210
are a lot alike.

02:10.243 --> 02:11.177
I'm a drug dealer.

02:11.211 --> 02:12.613
You defend drug dealers.

02:13.346 --> 02:14.715
We need to accept ourselves

02:14.748 --> 02:16.182
for what we are, Bobby.

02:16.916 --> 02:18.918
And add to that,

02:18.952 --> 02:21.522
I am the customer.

02:27.093 --> 02:29.563
(music playing)

03:16.883 --> 03:18.384
Why do I need help?

03:18.418 --> 03:19.553
I'm not saying
you need help.

03:19.586 --> 03:21.487
I'm just offering.
I'm fine.

03:21.522 --> 03:22.823
Thank you.

03:22.856 --> 03:25.091
YOUNG: Bobby, it is a cop
killer case. Those tend to--

03:25.125 --> 03:27.561
Did I lose the ability
to try cases alone?

03:28.128 --> 03:29.796
No.
Did I lose the ability

03:29.830 --> 03:31.197
to ask for help
when I need it?

03:31.231 --> 03:32.398
YOUNG: No.

03:32.432 --> 03:34.134
Did you lose the ability
to sleep?

03:34.167 --> 03:35.101
'Cause you look like crap.

03:36.670 --> 03:39.439
For you, I mean, you're still
better-looking than me.

03:46.747 --> 03:47.714
Can I help you?

03:47.748 --> 03:49.650
I need a lawyer.
I was arrested.

03:50.250 --> 03:50.984
HATCHER: For?

03:51.017 --> 03:54.154
Drugs, marijuana.

03:54.187 --> 03:55.421
They're gonna put me
in jail.

03:56.623 --> 03:58.191
Jamie?
Excellent.

04:00.801 --> 04:02.168
I'm Jamie Stringer.
Hello.

04:02.202 --> 04:03.704
I'll be your attorney.

04:03.737 --> 04:05.572
You are?
Tammy Roe.

04:05.972 --> 04:07.307
Let's go
in the conference room.

04:13.647 --> 04:15.649
GAMBLE: The evidence
will show Detective Bowers

04:15.682 --> 04:18.652
was working undercover
on a drug detail

04:18.685 --> 04:20.353
when the defendant,
Earl Johnson,

04:20.386 --> 04:21.755
attacked him,

04:21.788 --> 04:23.690
took his gun,

04:23.724 --> 04:25.025
and shot him to death.

04:25.926 --> 04:27.427
Detective Bowers

04:27.460 --> 04:29.262
was the first
Boston police officer

04:29.295 --> 04:30.864
to be killed
in the line of duty

04:30.897 --> 04:34.033
in over a decade.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.603
That's his wife, son,
and two daughters

04:36.636 --> 04:38.371
sitting over there.

04:38.404 --> 04:41.407
I'm sure we'd all like
to extend our condolences,

04:42.509 --> 04:44.945
but you can do something more.

04:46.112 --> 04:49.082
You can give them justice

04:49.115 --> 04:51.552
and at the end of this case,

04:51.585 --> 04:53.954
that's all they'll ask you for.

05:03.937 --> 05:04.971
Mr. Donnell?

05:13.880 --> 05:16.316
Justice is all
my client's entitled to,

05:18.251 --> 05:20.153
and it's all we ask for
as well.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.864
What the hell was that?

05:30.897 --> 05:32.866
DONNELL: I didn't wanna tip
our defense.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.401
Tip our defense?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.938
You give a one-liner--
Hey, fire me!

05:38.404 --> 05:40.774
What's going on with you?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.308
You've represented me
many times.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.010
Suddenly, you got
this big problem.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.411
My problem is you
suddenly doubting me.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.013
Because you seem different!

05:47.981 --> 05:49.816
Look, it's like you said,
you're the customer.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.618
I took your money. I'll give you
your money's worth.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.554
That opening?
Was designed to keep

05:53.587 --> 05:55.021
Helen Gamble in the dark.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.292
The fact that
you're in the dark stuns me.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.201
Given your advanced
mental acuity.

06:02.703 --> 06:03.804
What is this?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.209
You want me to threaten you

06:09.242 --> 06:10.911
so you can get off the case.

06:12.412 --> 06:15.181
I would never,
ever threaten you, Bobby.

06:15.215 --> 06:17.884
You keep forgetting,

06:17.918 --> 06:19.285
we're like brothers.

06:21.755 --> 06:24.324
(music playing)

06:24.791 --> 06:25.992
Will they put me
in prison?

06:26.026 --> 06:27.460
I highly doubt it.

06:27.493 --> 06:28.729
The fact that
they released you

06:28.762 --> 06:30.263
before even
being arraigned,

06:31.832 --> 06:33.266
I'll see you
at the courthouse, okay?

06:33.299 --> 06:35.135
Okay.

06:35.168 --> 06:35.836
Thank you.

06:41.542 --> 06:42.576
Okay.

06:42.609 --> 06:44.210
The search seems
to be bogus.

06:44.244 --> 06:46.479
She was pulled over
for rolling through a stop sign.

06:46.513 --> 06:48.348
Please. How much pot?

06:48.381 --> 06:49.249
An ounce.

06:49.282 --> 06:50.617
FRUTT: She wasn't under
the influence?

06:50.651 --> 06:52.853
STRINGER: No. Totally sober.

06:52.886 --> 06:53.787
Who's sitting,
do you know?

06:53.820 --> 06:57.157
I think Judge Brenford.
Why?

06:57.190 --> 06:58.659
Brenford?

06:59.059 --> 07:00.634
You're home.

07:00.667 --> 07:01.702
I'm sorry?

07:01.735 --> 07:04.337
Brenford is the flirting judge,

07:04.370 --> 07:06.507
and you've got blond hair.

07:06.540 --> 07:07.440
Forget it.

07:07.473 --> 07:08.775
This case is as good
as kicked.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.812
What do you mean,
"The flirting judge"?

07:11.845 --> 07:13.113
All you have to do

07:13.146 --> 07:14.948
is smile at him.

07:14.981 --> 07:16.149
Big smile.

07:16.182 --> 07:16.883
Over the top.

07:17.651 --> 07:20.220
If he thinks
you think he's cute,

07:20.253 --> 07:21.655
he'll suppress on the spot.

07:22.856 --> 07:24.958
What?
No, he's right.

07:24.991 --> 07:27.227
I've had six cases

07:27.260 --> 07:28.328
kicked on smiles alone.

07:28.361 --> 07:30.330
I mean, with Lindsay, pfft,

07:30.363 --> 07:32.165
he doesn't even wait
for the facts with her.

07:32.198 --> 07:32.999
Can you flirt?

07:33.033 --> 07:34.635
Can I flirt?

07:34.668 --> 07:36.402
Like, with every professor
I ever had,

07:36.436 --> 07:37.237
thank you.

07:37.270 --> 07:39.372
Like I said, you're home.

07:42.075 --> 07:43.309
Can I flirt?

07:46.079 --> 07:49.382
That was genius.

07:49.415 --> 07:50.884
That was mean.

07:52.753 --> 07:54.187
It was a buy-bust operation.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.590
Detective Bowers
was posing as a seller.

07:56.623 --> 07:58.625
Detective Bowers
was your partner?

07:58.659 --> 08:00.300
SLEZAK: Yes.
Our goal here

08:00.333 --> 08:01.835
was to arrest the defendant,

08:01.868 --> 08:03.937
then cut a deal for information

08:03.970 --> 08:05.706
on other drug sources.

08:05.739 --> 08:07.808
Detective, would you describe
what happened?

08:07.841 --> 08:09.776
SLEZAK: The operation
was in an alley

08:09.810 --> 08:11.878
between two
abandoned buildings.

08:11.912 --> 08:13.379
I manned an observation post

08:13.413 --> 08:15.048
on the roof
of one of the buildings,

08:15.081 --> 08:16.583
and we had unmarked cars

08:16.617 --> 08:17.918
at either end of the alley.

08:17.951 --> 08:18.852
And?

08:18.885 --> 08:20.086
SLEZAK: I saw the defendant,

08:20.120 --> 08:20.987
Earl Johnson,

08:21.021 --> 08:23.423
go into the alley
and walk up to Eddie.

08:23.456 --> 08:25.892
A minute later,
I heard a shot.

08:25.926 --> 08:27.828
By the time I got to him,
Eddie was dead.

08:29.530 --> 08:30.931
The defendant
started to run.

08:30.964 --> 08:32.533
I pulled my weapon,
went in pursuit,

08:32.566 --> 08:33.933
and eventually
apprehended him.

08:35.969 --> 08:38.705
You never actually saw
what happened?

08:38.739 --> 08:39.438
They were standing
in the bay

08:39.472 --> 08:41.207
of a roll-up garage door.

08:41.241 --> 08:41.942
It was dark.

08:42.475 --> 08:44.645
You didn't see it?
No.

08:44.678 --> 08:46.346
DONNELL: And you
couldn't hear either?

08:46.379 --> 08:47.881
SLEZAK: We don't wire
undercover officers

08:47.914 --> 08:49.149
in cases like this.

08:49.182 --> 08:51.618
DONNELL: So, if there had been
a fight for the gun,

08:51.652 --> 08:52.819
you wouldn't know?

08:52.853 --> 08:54.220
SLEZAK: If there'd been
a fight for the gun,

08:54.254 --> 08:56.489
your client would be dead.

08:56.523 --> 08:57.758
DONNELL: Would you say
Detective Bowers

08:57.791 --> 08:59.560
was an aggressive officer?

08:59.593 --> 09:01.267
SLEZAK: I would say
he was an excellent officer.

09:01.301 --> 09:03.403
Move to strike, non-responsive.
Sustained.

09:03.436 --> 09:05.739
SLEZAK: I wouldn't say
he was overly aggressive, no.

09:05.772 --> 09:07.007
DONNELL: But he'd fight
with suspects?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.675
SLEZAK: Yes.
He'd use his fists

09:08.709 --> 09:09.743
instead of his gun,

09:09.776 --> 09:11.144
which probably saved lives.

09:11.177 --> 09:12.513
But some suspects complained

09:12.546 --> 09:14.981
that he used excessive
physical force.

09:15.716 --> 09:17.884
Not one of those complaints
was ever upheld.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.155
Thank you. Nothing further.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.094
(elevator bell dings)

09:29.896 --> 09:31.665
(indistinct chatter)

09:31.698 --> 09:33.099
Okay. You're up next.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.635
I expect it
to be pretty quick.

09:35.702 --> 09:37.070
Don't editorialized.

09:37.103 --> 09:39.272
This lawyer will make you
pay for it.

09:39.305 --> 09:40.473
Just spit out the facts.

09:42.175 --> 09:44.545
You expect it to be quick?

09:44.578 --> 09:46.046
Ms. Gamble,

09:46.079 --> 09:47.447
you did read the autopsy?

09:47.914 --> 09:50.283
Yes. Single gunshot wound
to the chest.

09:50.884 --> 09:52.418
Did you keep reading?

09:57.023 --> 09:59.860
Steroids?
DOCTOR: I'm not saying illegal.

09:59.893 --> 10:01.301
The over-the-counter
muscle-building supplements

10:01.334 --> 10:02.836
are identical
to the illegal stuff.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.270
Was he ever tested?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.706
For drugs of abuse,

10:05.739 --> 10:07.173
coke, heroin,

10:07.207 --> 10:08.374
not steroids.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.579
Steroid rage.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.115
What?
GAMBLE: Of course.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.382
That's their defense.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.318
Bobby Donnell
is going to argue

10:18.351 --> 10:19.953
that your partner flipped out.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.054
SLEZAK: That's ridiculous.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.789
GAMBLE: He's got a few excessive

10:22.823 --> 10:25.125
force complaints
on his record...

10:25.158 --> 10:26.159
SLEZAK: Look,

10:26.192 --> 10:28.529
Eddie never had
any steroid rage.

10:28.562 --> 10:31.031
He was my partner
for nine years.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.366
I'm telling you,
he was an even-tempered guy,

10:33.399 --> 10:34.801
and this was a standard bust.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.970
GAMBLE: Well, he had steroids
in his system.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.272
Bobby Donnell
has that autopsy report.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.442
He's going to argue
your partner started the fight.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.343
Trust me.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.948
(music playing)

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
Commonwealth vs. Tammy Roe.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.952
Possession
of controlled substance.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.020
Your Honor, we'd like to,

10:54.054 --> 10:55.488
you know, waive reading,

10:55.522 --> 10:56.523
if that's all right.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.325
Since there's no question
of bail,

10:59.359 --> 11:01.401
we'd like to move
to suppress the search

11:01.434 --> 11:03.403
at your convenience.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.372
Why are you so happy?

11:06.406 --> 11:08.875
Just happy to be here,
Your Honor.

11:10.911 --> 11:11.745
Why?

11:11.778 --> 11:13.446
My client was stopped

11:13.479 --> 11:15.248
for rolling
through a stop sign.

11:15.281 --> 11:16.683
There was no reasonable basis

11:16.717 --> 11:17.851
to search her car,

11:17.884 --> 11:20.086
and I always enjoy
being able to right

11:20.120 --> 11:21.888
a constitutional wrong.

11:24.658 --> 11:25.892
Are you a real lawyer?

11:25.926 --> 11:28.428
Am I--yes.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.268
Are you--are you coming
on to me?

11:35.301 --> 11:37.270
I would never--

11:37.303 --> 11:38.905
as hard as it is to resist.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.942
I just...

11:48.448 --> 11:51.384
(music playing)

11:56.089 --> 11:58.224
I am so sorry, Your Honor.

11:58.258 --> 11:59.926
I started some
new allergy medication,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.202
and it has made me so...

12:02.235 --> 12:03.737
loopy.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.906
I just like to schedule
a suppression hearing,

12:05.939 --> 12:08.241
if I could,
where I could question

12:08.274 --> 12:09.475
the arresting officer.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.177
2:00.

12:12.613 --> 12:14.114
Will you be normal by then?

12:14.147 --> 12:16.617
Yes, Your Honor.

12:16.650 --> 12:17.718
Thank you.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.159
What were you doing?

12:26.192 --> 12:27.393
It was technical.

12:28.261 --> 12:30.430
It didn't seem
like normal lawyering to me.

12:33.567 --> 12:35.135
Wait here, one second.

12:38.071 --> 12:39.773
I cannot believe
you did that!

12:40.373 --> 12:42.075
It was a joke, Jamie.
Calm down.

12:42.108 --> 12:43.610
It was not a funny joke.

12:43.644 --> 12:45.512
You humiliated me!

12:45.546 --> 12:46.947
This is a real case, you know,

12:46.980 --> 12:49.249
and somebody's freedom
is at stake, and you decide--

12:49.282 --> 12:51.117
It was marijuana, please.

12:51.151 --> 12:53.687
CARLTON: Ms. Stringer,
if I may ask--

12:53.720 --> 12:54.921
what the hell was that?

12:54.955 --> 12:56.657
Didn't you hear me?
Allergy medication.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.792
Uh-huh. Listen,

12:58.825 --> 13:00.767
I'll give your girl
two years.

13:00.801 --> 13:02.869
If you challenge the search,
I'm going for seven.

13:02.903 --> 13:04.437
FRUTT: Seven? What?

13:04.470 --> 13:05.839
CARLTON: She has two priors
for coke.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.340
FRUTT: Even so,
seven years-

13:07.373 --> 13:08.474
One was for dealing.

13:10.744 --> 13:12.145
Look,

13:12.178 --> 13:13.847
take the two.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.616
Otherwise--
I'll let you know.

13:18.652 --> 13:20.521
(music playing)

13:21.187 --> 13:23.389
You didn't tell us
she had a prior for dealing.

13:46.847 --> 13:49.115
Come on, Bobby.

13:49.149 --> 13:50.283
Take your turn.

13:54.354 --> 13:56.089
You don't know
what you're missing.

13:58.058 --> 13:59.092
Bobby,

14:00.200 --> 14:01.034
Bobby.

14:02.135 --> 14:03.069
Bobby.

14:04.905 --> 14:06.272
Aren't you due back at 1:00?

14:10.544 --> 14:12.646
DOCTOR: The officer died
from a single gunshot wound

14:12.679 --> 14:13.847
to the chest.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.617
The bullet exited the body
at the sixth cervical vertebra.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.484
It was fired
by the officer's own weapon,

14:18.519 --> 14:19.886
a police-issue Glock.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.855
GAMBLE: Tell us
about the entry wound.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.690
It had powder residue
and stippling burns

14:23.724 --> 14:25.458
arranged in a stellate pattern.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.793
GAMBLE: Meaning?

14:26.827 --> 14:28.261
DOCTOR: The muzzle was jammed

14:28.294 --> 14:30.564
up into the victim's chest
with pressure.

14:30.597 --> 14:32.866
He was shot point-blank.

14:32.899 --> 14:35.035
Thank you, doctor.
Nothing further.

14:37.771 --> 14:40.073
The report says
the entry wound

14:40.106 --> 14:41.575
was elongated.

14:41.608 --> 14:44.878
Yes, the muzzle wasn't flat
against the body.

14:44.911 --> 14:46.046
It was angled.

14:46.079 --> 14:47.981
How did the muzzle get angled?

14:48.014 --> 14:49.215
I don't know.

14:49.249 --> 14:51.151
You also don't know
why my client

14:51.184 --> 14:52.318
was in the alley

14:52.352 --> 14:54.420
or what happened
before the gun was fired.

14:55.121 --> 14:56.289
No.

14:56.322 --> 14:57.390
For all you know,

14:57.423 --> 14:59.593
this shooting
was accidental.

14:59.626 --> 15:02.603
DOCTOR: I suppose
it could've been suicide, too,

15:02.636 --> 15:03.837
but I doubt it.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.807
Isn't it possible that
there was a fight for the gun,

15:06.840 --> 15:07.874
and it went off?

15:07.908 --> 15:10.043
DOCTOR: It's possible,
or the street was angled,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.178
or your client's hands slipped,

15:12.212 --> 15:14.280
or the victim flinched.

15:24.725 --> 15:25.792
Thank you, doctor.

15:25.826 --> 15:27.260
Nothing further.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.098
(music playing)

15:32.132 --> 15:32.899
SWACKHEIM: Ms. Gamble,

15:32.933 --> 15:34.200
redirect?

15:35.736 --> 15:36.937
No.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.709
(indistinct chatter)

15:51.117 --> 15:52.553
What are you doing?

15:54.154 --> 15:54.988
What do you mean?

15:55.021 --> 15:57.591
Well, Bobby,
what's your defense?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.526
Accident? Self-defense?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.401
I don't have to tell you, Helen.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.637
GAMBLE: Well, actually,
if it's self-defense,

16:03.670 --> 16:05.872
you do have to give notice.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.274
I'll tell you
what you need to know.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.979
Bobby,

16:13.013 --> 16:14.180
would you look at me?

16:16.617 --> 16:18.451
Are you all right?

16:19.953 --> 16:21.221
I'm fine.

16:25.425 --> 16:26.359
GAMBLE: Is he sleeping?

16:26.392 --> 16:27.327
Not enough.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.229
Why isn't somebody
second-chairing?

16:29.262 --> 16:30.230
He won't have it.

16:31.431 --> 16:32.766
Helen,

16:32.799 --> 16:34.200
is he really screwing up?

16:34.234 --> 16:35.101
I don't know.

16:35.135 --> 16:36.970
He could be laying a trap
to sandbag me.

16:37.003 --> 16:39.606
You guys have pulled
so many stunts,

16:39.773 --> 16:42.909
but he seems off.

16:42.943 --> 16:44.310
He's either screwing up

16:44.344 --> 16:46.913
or he's got me exactly
where he wants me.

16:50.584 --> 16:52.686
The suspect had proceeded
through a stop sign

16:52.719 --> 16:54.487
without coming to a full stop.

16:54.521 --> 16:56.790
CARLTON: Okay. And then
you searched the vehicle?

16:56.823 --> 16:58.491
Yes, finding a packet

16:58.525 --> 17:00.233
which appeared
to be marijuana.

17:00.266 --> 17:03.103
Lab analysis concluded
it was marijuana,

17:03.136 --> 17:04.838
and the suspect
was placed under arrest

17:04.871 --> 17:06.439
for possession
of a controlled substance.

17:06.472 --> 17:08.174
CARLTON: All right.
What made you decide

17:08.208 --> 17:09.542
to search the vehicle?

17:09.576 --> 17:11.243
It had
a "watch your car" sticker

17:11.277 --> 17:12.145
on the rear bumper.

17:13.579 --> 17:14.881
I beg your pardon?

17:14.915 --> 17:16.950
OFFICER: It's a way
to help citizens fight crime.

17:16.983 --> 17:19.219
They register with us,
we give them a sticker,

17:19.252 --> 17:21.487
which lets us stop
and search their car

17:21.521 --> 17:23.523
to make sure
that it's not stolen

17:23.557 --> 17:24.758
or being used in a crime.

17:25.559 --> 17:26.627
On the decal, it says,

17:26.660 --> 17:28.729
"You have consent
to search this vehicle."

17:28.762 --> 17:30.731
CARLTON: Is it
a successful program?

17:30.764 --> 17:32.866
OFFICER: Very.
Over a hundred cities and towns

17:32.899 --> 17:34.968
in Massachusetts participate.

17:35.001 --> 17:37.504
Insurance companies even reduce
your rates if you join.

17:37.538 --> 17:38.839
How many cars
in that neighborhood

17:38.872 --> 17:40.106
have those stickers?

17:40.140 --> 17:41.842
Almost all the cars
on my beat.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.944
It's how we've cut
auto theft

17:43.977 --> 17:46.012
and other crimes
in the area by half.

17:49.082 --> 17:51.151
You searched her car

17:51.184 --> 17:52.452
because of a bumper sticker?

17:52.485 --> 17:55.121
One that gave me consent
to search, yes.

17:55.155 --> 17:56.857
This wasn't even her car.

17:56.890 --> 17:58.091
It was her parents' car.

17:58.124 --> 17:59.292
And her parents'
bumper sticker.

17:59.860 --> 18:00.767
But she knew about it.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.569
STRINGER:
So, you're claiming

18:02.603 --> 18:05.539
you got your consent
to search

18:05.572 --> 18:07.140
from a bumper sticker?

18:07.173 --> 18:08.575
And a decal.

18:11.812 --> 18:12.813
Is that legal?

18:12.846 --> 18:14.047
A lot of cities
have been doing this.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.082
Neighbors banding together,
giving up rights.

18:16.116 --> 18:17.784
That's--that's...

18:17.818 --> 18:18.652
Unconstitutional?

18:19.853 --> 18:21.187
No court has said so.

18:21.221 --> 18:23.023
I'm going to challenge it.

18:23.056 --> 18:23.757
You won't win.

18:23.790 --> 18:24.858
STRINGER: But this?

18:24.891 --> 18:26.092
A bumper sticker

18:26.126 --> 18:27.561
waiving Fourth Amendment rights?

18:27.594 --> 18:30.363
Jamie, is the deal
still on the table?

18:31.464 --> 18:33.600
STRINGER: Um, no.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.069
So, she's looking
at seven years?

18:37.337 --> 18:38.104
Yes.

18:42.108 --> 18:44.978
JOHNSON: I walked into the alley
to buy heroin.

18:45.011 --> 18:46.012
I'm a heroin addict.

18:46.046 --> 18:48.081
Did you see
Officer Bowers there?

18:48.114 --> 18:50.150
I didn't know
he was an officer.

18:50.183 --> 18:52.485
He told me
he was a drug dealer.

18:52.519 --> 18:53.754
I told him what I wanted.

18:53.787 --> 18:56.056
I also told him
his prices were too high.

18:56.089 --> 18:58.358
When it looked like
the deal was going south,

18:58.391 --> 19:00.400
he grabbed me
and threw me into the wall.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.769
Next thing I knew,
we were in a fight.

19:02.803 --> 19:04.237
I heard gunshots.

19:04.270 --> 19:05.606
His body falls to the ground.

19:05.639 --> 19:07.107
DONNELL:
Did you ever attack him?

19:07.140 --> 19:08.141
Never.

19:08.174 --> 19:09.843
DONNELL: Did you ever try
to take his gun?

19:09.876 --> 19:12.579
I didn't know he had a gun.

19:12.613 --> 19:14.915
I never intended
to hurt him.

19:16.517 --> 19:18.384
GAMBLE: You were desperate
for heroin.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.653
I was eager.

19:19.686 --> 19:20.887
GAMBLE: So eager, in fact,

19:20.921 --> 19:22.556
that you tried
to steal the drugs,

19:22.589 --> 19:24.257
which led to you
stealing his gun

19:24.290 --> 19:25.559
and killing him.
JOHNSON: No.

19:25.592 --> 19:28.094
The objection is sustained.

19:28.128 --> 19:30.063
GAMBLE: You have
stolen drugs before.

19:30.096 --> 19:32.398
Yes, and I've stolen
to buy drugs.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.267
In fact,
you're a convicted felon.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.402
Yes.
A convicted felon

19:36.436 --> 19:38.539
that has lied
about his drug crimes.

19:38.572 --> 19:40.607
Yes.
Just like you're lying now

19:40.641 --> 19:42.776
to avoid punishment
for this drug crime.

19:42.809 --> 19:44.344
JOHNSON: No.

19:44.377 --> 19:46.146
I mean,

19:46.179 --> 19:47.614
lying is a part of my disease,
but, I am not--

19:47.648 --> 19:50.884
Lying is a part
of your disease.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.085
After the gun went off

19:52.118 --> 19:53.453
and Detective Bowers

19:53.486 --> 19:55.522
slumped to the ground,

19:55.556 --> 19:56.489
what did you do?

19:56.523 --> 19:58.992
I, um, I ran.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.667
You didn't try
to get him help?

20:00.701 --> 20:03.236
JOHNSON: I knew how
it would look, so I just ran.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.105
Did you take
anything with you?

20:05.972 --> 20:06.740
The heroin.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.274
Anything else?

20:09.275 --> 20:12.012
The gun.
The gun.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.780
The gun that had gone off

20:13.814 --> 20:15.782
and killed a police officer?

20:16.482 --> 20:17.283
Yes.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.852
Had you grabbed for the gun

20:18.885 --> 20:20.554
prior to it going off?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.422
No.
GAMBLE: Uh-huh.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.724
So, you just pick up a gun

20:23.757 --> 20:25.526
that has killed
a police officer,

20:25.559 --> 20:27.260
putting your prints on it,

20:27.293 --> 20:29.262
putting it in your possession?

20:31.798 --> 20:33.366
Well, that makes
a lot of sense.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.337
Nothing further.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.776
(music playing)

20:44.410 --> 20:45.812
Mr. Donnell?

20:47.881 --> 20:49.783
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.753
(music playing)

21:03.069 --> 21:04.905
CARLTON: I told you
if you challenge the search,

21:04.938 --> 21:06.139
the offer's no good.

21:06.172 --> 21:08.041
Yes, that's why
I'm unchallenging it now.

21:10.076 --> 21:10.844
Please.

21:10.877 --> 21:12.846
Is this your first case?

21:12.879 --> 21:15.248
My first--are you kidding?

21:15.281 --> 21:17.083
Right.
My first--I think not.

21:19.152 --> 21:19.853
Second.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.856
Look, the idea of this girl

21:22.889 --> 21:25.225
getting seven years...

21:25.258 --> 21:26.993
CARLTON: I have marching orders
from my office.

21:27.027 --> 21:28.328
The deal is off, Jamie.

21:29.730 --> 21:31.532
But, on a more positive note,

21:31.565 --> 21:33.133
if you look over there,

21:36.036 --> 21:38.639
seems they like your work.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.541
(indistinct chatter)

21:40.574 --> 21:43.510
(music playing)

21:47.681 --> 21:49.182
YOUNG: Who are you
feeling sorry for here,

21:49.215 --> 21:50.584
yourself or your client?

21:50.617 --> 21:51.451
Both.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.353
Before, you were
feeling outrage.

21:53.386 --> 21:55.321
You need to hang on to that.
Use it.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.058
Challenge
on Fourth Amendment grounds.

21:58.091 --> 21:59.359
Tap into your outrage.

22:00.433 --> 22:01.367
Okay.

22:01.401 --> 22:04.070
Look, this is no time to sulk.

22:04.104 --> 22:06.272
This is where you dig in.

22:08.474 --> 22:09.409
Right.

22:17.450 --> 22:18.652
(clears throat)

22:25.058 --> 22:27.027
You need any help
with research or anything?

22:27.060 --> 22:28.228
I'm fine. Thank you.

22:29.796 --> 22:31.264
Jamie...

22:31.297 --> 22:31.998
I'm sorry.

22:32.032 --> 22:33.333
I...
You know what?

22:33.366 --> 22:36.469
I really have to work
on this, Jimmy.

22:36.503 --> 22:37.437
Okay?

22:39.439 --> 22:40.541
Sure.

22:46.513 --> 22:47.180
(door opens)

22:50.050 --> 22:51.251
Got a second?

22:51.284 --> 22:53.520
Better be worth it, Helen.

22:53.554 --> 22:55.288
In addition
to being ex parte,

22:55.321 --> 22:57.023
you're coming between me
and the crapper.

22:58.559 --> 23:00.400
I already have
the sports pages in hand.

23:01.401 --> 23:03.136
I'd like to move
for a mistrial.

23:04.237 --> 23:05.471
I beg your pardon?

23:05.506 --> 23:07.073
As unorthodox
as it seems--

23:07.107 --> 23:08.241
On what grounds?

23:08.875 --> 23:10.611
Inadequate counsel.

23:11.812 --> 23:12.879
You're the prosecutor.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.815
GAMBLE: I'm also an officer
of this court

23:14.848 --> 23:15.949
and from where I sit,

23:15.982 --> 23:18.118
Bobby Donnell's tanking
this trial.

23:19.853 --> 23:21.688
That's a pretty serious
allegation.

23:21.722 --> 23:23.356
GAMBLE: Look,
the victim had steroids

23:23.389 --> 23:24.625
in his system.

23:24.658 --> 23:26.627
It was in the autopsy report.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.228
For Bobby not to take
advantage of that...

23:28.261 --> 23:30.163
Maybe he didn't read
the autopsy.

23:30.196 --> 23:31.932
GAMBLE: We're talking
about Bobby Donnell.

23:31.965 --> 23:33.967
Come on, he gave
a two-sentence opening.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.402
His crosses have been weak.

23:36.436 --> 23:38.939
Have you even been able
to discern a defense theory?

23:38.972 --> 23:40.741
Yes, accident.

23:40.774 --> 23:43.810
Look, the defendant
is a cop killer.

23:43.844 --> 23:45.846
Clearly,
I wanna put him away,

23:45.879 --> 23:47.748
but I have
a separate obligation

23:47.781 --> 23:50.216
to make sure his rights
are protected,

23:50.250 --> 23:51.084
as do you.

23:51.117 --> 23:52.318
SWACKHEIM: First of all,

23:52.352 --> 23:53.620
nothing Bobby has done

23:53.654 --> 23:55.288
rises to the level
of incompetence.

23:55.321 --> 23:56.523
GAMBLE:
But if we have knowledge

23:56.557 --> 23:59.793
that a lawyer is deliberately
trying to lose--

23:59.826 --> 24:00.701
Come on.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.068
Do you really think that?

24:03.837 --> 24:05.005
No,

24:05.038 --> 24:06.840
but I think
he's hit a wall.

24:06.873 --> 24:08.308
He looks numb.

24:08.341 --> 24:09.610
SWACKHEIM: Look, the law says

24:09.643 --> 24:11.211
I'm not supposed to undermine

24:11.244 --> 24:12.312
the defendant's confidence

24:12.345 --> 24:13.980
in his own lawyer.

24:14.014 --> 24:16.382
So far, this idiot
seems fine with Donnell.

24:17.718 --> 24:18.985
If you want,
you can report him

24:19.019 --> 24:21.121
to the bar
when this is over.

24:21.154 --> 24:22.388
Until then,

24:22.422 --> 24:24.457
all you can do
is your job,

24:24.490 --> 24:25.692
not his.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.131
Helen...

24:32.999 --> 24:35.135
I will speak to him.

24:43.610 --> 24:44.511
(sighs)

24:44.545 --> 24:46.346
I was going to a party.

24:46.379 --> 24:47.280
Stupidly,

24:47.313 --> 24:48.915
I brought along
a little pot.

24:49.716 --> 24:50.884
I'm ashamed that I did so,

24:50.917 --> 24:52.686
but--

24:52.719 --> 24:54.387
my parents
are alcoholics, Your Honor,

24:54.420 --> 24:56.557
and I so don't wanna end up
like them.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.191
So, I took pot.

24:58.224 --> 24:59.259
STRINGER: Yes,

24:59.292 --> 25:01.034
and Tammy,
you've used drugs

25:01.067 --> 25:02.569
in the past, haven't you?

25:02.603 --> 25:03.670
Two years ago,

25:03.704 --> 25:06.206
I also stupidly used cocaine.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.474
I once got enough to share
with some of my friends,

25:08.509 --> 25:11.277
and I was arrested
for dealing when--

25:11.311 --> 25:12.846
I am so not a dealer,

25:12.879 --> 25:15.148
and I totally
don't do cocaine anymore

25:15.181 --> 25:16.016
at all.

25:16.049 --> 25:17.551
Just pot?

25:18.384 --> 25:19.452
It was stupid.

25:19.485 --> 25:20.621
STRINGER: Tammy,

25:20.654 --> 25:22.789
referring back
to when you were stopped,

25:22.823 --> 25:24.725
did you know
about this bumper sticker

25:24.758 --> 25:25.892
on your car?

25:25.926 --> 25:27.393
Well,

25:27.427 --> 25:28.094
I did,

25:28.128 --> 25:29.763
but...

25:29.796 --> 25:30.864
I thought it was, like,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.432
this neighborhood watch
kind of thing.

25:32.465 --> 25:33.466
I didn't know it meant

25:33.499 --> 25:35.669
they could actually
search my car.

25:37.337 --> 25:39.005
CARLTON: That's not exactly
what you said

25:39.039 --> 25:41.374
to the police officer,
is it, Tammy?

25:41.808 --> 25:43.143
I was really nervous.

25:43.176 --> 25:45.211
Do you remember
what it was you said?

25:45.846 --> 25:47.548
Uh, no.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.516
You told him
the bumper sticker

25:49.550 --> 25:50.316
had expired.

25:51.552 --> 25:53.186
I was really nervous.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.588
CARLTON: You were nervous.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.488
In fact,

25:55.522 --> 25:57.658
one of the reasons your father

25:57.691 --> 26:00.333
put the bumper sticker
on the car

26:00.366 --> 26:01.768
was to deter you
from using,

26:01.802 --> 26:02.803
isn't that right, Tammy?

26:03.403 --> 26:04.437
Yes.

26:04.470 --> 26:06.540
And you knew that,
didn't you, Tammy?

26:08.709 --> 26:09.876
Yes.

26:13.814 --> 26:14.748
(knocks on door)

26:15.682 --> 26:16.617
(sighs)

26:16.650 --> 26:17.417
What's up?

26:18.652 --> 26:19.986
Why don't you tell me,
Bobby?

26:20.020 --> 26:20.821
What's up?

26:22.355 --> 26:23.456
I'm not following.

26:24.090 --> 26:26.026
Do you think you're doing
your best work in there?

26:26.059 --> 26:28.394
Hey, I'm open to ideas
if you got any.

26:28.428 --> 26:30.731
SWACKHEIM: Oh,
you're open to ideas?

26:30.764 --> 26:32.265
How about an opening statement

26:32.298 --> 26:34.500
that runs to double digits,
syllable-wise?

26:34.535 --> 26:37.103
How about an aggressive
cross-examination?

26:37.137 --> 26:38.639
How about you get it
into evidence

26:38.672 --> 26:40.674
that the victim was on steroids

26:40.707 --> 26:41.875
at the time he was killed?

26:41.908 --> 26:43.476
DONNELL:
It was a strategic decision.

26:43.510 --> 26:44.310
There was no evidence.

26:44.344 --> 26:45.979
Oh, bull.

26:46.012 --> 26:48.849
Your defense
has been anemic at best.

26:48.882 --> 26:50.884
Helen Gamble
is convinced you're tubing.

26:52.285 --> 26:53.386
Excuse me?

26:53.419 --> 26:55.321
She came to me
as an officer of the court

26:55.355 --> 26:57.090
and asked for a mistrial.

26:57.123 --> 26:58.625
And I had half a mind
to grant it, but--

26:58.659 --> 27:00.466
Hey, take me off if you
don't like what I'm doing!

27:00.500 --> 27:02.068
It's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

27:02.102 --> 27:03.069
You wanna do my job?

27:03.103 --> 27:04.638
No, I want you
to do your job.

27:04.671 --> 27:06.339
DONNELL: Hey, I go
into that damn room

27:06.372 --> 27:07.340
day after day

27:07.373 --> 27:09.409
to defend people
who deserve to rot!

27:09.442 --> 27:10.310
You think that's easy?

27:10.343 --> 27:11.845
I expect you
to give your client--

27:11.878 --> 27:14.047
DONNELL: He raped a kid,
for God's sake!

27:14.548 --> 27:16.016
He was 13!

27:16.049 --> 27:17.383
You think I can just...

27:17.417 --> 27:18.952
waltz in there...

27:18.985 --> 27:19.720
and get him off?

27:19.753 --> 27:21.655
It isn't that easy,

27:21.688 --> 27:23.356
and I'm doing everything I can.

27:25.559 --> 27:27.460
Your client
didn't rape any kid.

27:29.495 --> 27:30.764
He killed a cop.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.433
That was another client

27:33.466 --> 27:34.334
who raped a kid.

27:38.605 --> 27:39.906
DONNELL: Right.

27:40.574 --> 27:41.608
Whatever.

27:42.976 --> 27:43.810
That it? Can I go?

27:43.844 --> 27:46.379
SWACKHEIM: No, you can't.

27:46.412 --> 27:48.615
Bring in Eugene Young
to give the closing.

27:50.216 --> 27:51.284
What?

27:52.352 --> 27:53.353
You can't order that.

27:53.386 --> 27:54.821
I can and I just did.

27:54.855 --> 27:56.557
We'll continue this
till tomorrow.

27:56.590 --> 27:57.591
Bring in Mr. Young.

27:57.624 --> 27:58.859
I've prepared my closing.

27:58.892 --> 28:00.200
You're not doing it.
Your Honor--

28:00.233 --> 28:01.935
I'm giving you an order,
Counsel.

28:01.968 --> 28:04.705
Eugene Young
will give the closing.

28:07.841 --> 28:11.812
CARLTON: The officer saw
the most valid basis imaginable

28:11.845 --> 28:13.113
to search the vehicle.

28:13.647 --> 28:15.982
The decal said,
"You have consent

28:16.016 --> 28:17.584
to search this car."

28:18.184 --> 28:19.953
The defendant had knowledge

28:19.986 --> 28:22.322
of the bumper sticker,
the decal

28:22.789 --> 28:24.691
and even if she didn't,

28:24.725 --> 28:26.860
what we look at
for Fourth Amendment purposes

28:26.893 --> 28:29.563
is the officer's state of mind.

28:29.596 --> 28:31.164
In his mind,

28:31.197 --> 28:32.432
seeing that decal,

28:32.465 --> 28:33.900
he had a good-faith basis

28:33.934 --> 28:35.068
to believe there was consent.

28:35.101 --> 28:36.069
End of issue.

28:36.637 --> 28:38.939
And as for defense
counsel's outrage

28:38.972 --> 28:41.074
over this bumper-sticker policy,

28:41.107 --> 28:43.977
we're trying to win a war here,
Your Honor,

28:44.010 --> 28:45.011
and we're losing.

28:45.679 --> 28:48.615
Sixty percent
of the global drug market

28:48.649 --> 28:49.783
is in this country.

28:49.816 --> 28:50.917
That's staggering.

28:51.652 --> 28:55.522
If these bumper stickers
seem like desperate measures,

28:55.556 --> 28:56.857
we are desperate.

28:57.658 --> 28:58.825
Here we have a town saying,

28:58.859 --> 29:01.367
"Hey, you know what?
Let's help.

29:01.401 --> 29:02.636
Search our cars.

29:02.669 --> 29:04.905
We give you permission.

29:04.938 --> 29:06.940
If it'll stem drug traffic,

29:06.973 --> 29:08.609
if it'll save lives,

29:08.642 --> 29:09.810
search our cars."

29:10.644 --> 29:12.145
That's what her parents said

29:12.178 --> 29:14.447
when they attached
that bumper sticker,

29:14.480 --> 29:16.717
which Tammy Roe knew about.

29:17.417 --> 29:18.184
She waived her rights.

29:18.218 --> 29:20.521
The search was valid.

29:20.554 --> 29:21.522
The motion to suppress

29:21.555 --> 29:22.956
should be denied.

29:35.569 --> 29:38.204
I had a law professor
who would say,

29:38.238 --> 29:40.040
"When people start
to get scared enough,

29:40.073 --> 29:41.542
the first thing
they'll sacrifice

29:41.575 --> 29:43.109
is their Civil Rights."

29:44.310 --> 29:46.212
And look what we have here,

29:46.246 --> 29:48.582
a whole town full of people

29:48.615 --> 29:50.116
slapping on bumper stickers

29:50.150 --> 29:51.885
saying, "Search our cars."

29:52.819 --> 29:53.787
Tomorrow,

29:53.820 --> 29:55.656
decals on the front door,

29:55.689 --> 29:56.890
"Search our house."

29:56.923 --> 29:59.526
Coming soon,
maybe a rights-free street,

29:59.560 --> 30:02.068
or a town with signs
at the border saying,

30:02.102 --> 30:04.037
"If you cross the city lines,

30:04.070 --> 30:05.872
you waive Fourth, Fifth,

30:05.906 --> 30:07.674
Sixth Amendment rights."

30:07.708 --> 30:10.176
Maybe one day a whole state
will go for it.

30:12.579 --> 30:14.848
What are we doing?

30:14.881 --> 30:16.617
Are we all going mad?

30:18.719 --> 30:21.154
Mr. Carlton says,
"What's the big deal?

30:21.187 --> 30:23.223
This is happening all over."

30:23.256 --> 30:24.390
My response?

30:24.424 --> 30:26.159
"My God.

30:26.192 --> 30:29.596
This is happening all over."

30:31.297 --> 30:33.366
In this day
of rampant police abuse,

30:33.399 --> 30:35.368
we're actually
saying to them,

30:35.401 --> 30:36.870
"Hey...

30:36.903 --> 30:38.104
do whatever you want."

30:40.507 --> 30:42.075
What is going on?

30:43.577 --> 30:46.513
(music playing)

30:48.982 --> 30:50.283
(door opens)

30:50.316 --> 30:51.685
What the hell are you doing
going to Swackheim?

30:51.718 --> 30:53.019
Please don't yell at me.

30:53.053 --> 30:53.887
I will yell!

30:53.920 --> 30:55.388
You go behind my back?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.190
That's defamation, Helen.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.059
You disparage somebody's
professional skills?

30:59.092 --> 30:59.926
That's slander!

30:59.960 --> 31:01.167
You wanna sue me?

31:01.201 --> 31:02.969
You think I won't?

31:04.270 --> 31:05.205
You think I won't?!

31:05.238 --> 31:06.840
All right,
you're scaring me now.

31:06.873 --> 31:08.609
We're friends,
for God sakes.

31:08.642 --> 31:10.043
You go to a judge accusing me

31:10.076 --> 31:11.512
of throwing a case?

31:11.545 --> 31:12.345
How could you?!

31:12.378 --> 31:13.346
Because we're friends.

31:13.379 --> 31:15.616
DONNELL:
Don't you ever, ever--

31:15.649 --> 31:16.416
Bobby, let's go.

31:16.449 --> 31:17.618
I need a second.
Bobby.

31:17.651 --> 31:19.252
I said I need a second.

31:19.285 --> 31:20.754
And I said let's go.

31:29.129 --> 31:30.196
Okay?

31:30.230 --> 31:31.464
Fine.

31:50.316 --> 31:51.384
BRENFORD: The Fourth Amendment

31:51.417 --> 31:53.419
protects reasonable expectations

31:53.453 --> 31:54.521
of privacy.

31:55.922 --> 31:58.525
The law defines
reasonable expectations

31:58.559 --> 32:00.300
of privacy as those society

32:00.333 --> 32:01.868
is prepared to protect.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.938
Does anyone know what they are?

32:04.971 --> 32:06.840
Two years ago, I could tell you.

32:06.873 --> 32:07.808
Not now.

32:08.408 --> 32:10.877
We have all agreed
to be searched so often,

32:10.911 --> 32:13.514
when we travel,
when we go to the ballpark,

32:13.547 --> 32:15.015
when we enter buildings,

32:15.048 --> 32:17.083
that I don't know
what a reasonable expectation

32:17.117 --> 32:19.119
of privacy is anymore.

32:19.853 --> 32:21.254
Under the law,

32:21.287 --> 32:23.156
if Americans post signs
in front of their homes

32:23.189 --> 32:25.191
inviting the police in
to search,

32:25.225 --> 32:27.393
society no longer gives me

32:27.427 --> 32:29.763
an expectation of privacy
in my home.

32:30.864 --> 32:32.398
God help us when it happens.

32:34.367 --> 32:36.903
As a matter of law,

32:36.937 --> 32:40.807
I find the defendant waived
her Fourth Amendment rights

32:40.841 --> 32:42.909
if she knew about the sticker

32:42.943 --> 32:44.277
and drove anyway.

32:45.111 --> 32:47.948
But I think the prosecutor
has to carry its burden

32:47.981 --> 32:50.150
that she absolutely did know.

32:51.852 --> 32:53.820
Ms. Roe...

32:53.854 --> 32:55.155
I think you did,

32:57.257 --> 32:59.459
but since I can't be sure,

32:59.492 --> 33:01.301
I'm going to let
what little doubt I have

33:01.334 --> 33:03.203
cut in your favor.

33:03.236 --> 33:04.738
I'm suppressing the search

33:04.771 --> 33:07.007
and dismissing the indictment.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.009
You dodged a bullet, young lady.

33:09.042 --> 33:10.577
(gavel bangs)
BRENFORD: We're adjourned.

33:10.611 --> 33:12.579
I won!

33:12.613 --> 33:13.379
You won.

33:13.413 --> 33:14.515
(laughs)

33:14.548 --> 33:16.216
Congratulations.

33:16.249 --> 33:17.918
Thank you,
Ms. Stringer.

33:17.951 --> 33:18.885
The next time I get caught,

33:18.919 --> 33:21.254
I am so definitely
coming to you.

33:21.822 --> 33:22.823
Excellent.

33:24.791 --> 33:26.760
We know detective Bowers

33:26.793 --> 33:29.262
was killed with his own gun.

33:29.295 --> 33:32.533
The defendant,
a convicted felon,

33:32.566 --> 33:34.267
admits he was desperate
for drugs

33:34.300 --> 33:36.770
and was unhappy
when he didn't get them.

33:37.604 --> 33:39.606
He was arrested at the scene,

33:39.640 --> 33:42.442
and he admits that
there was some kind

33:42.475 --> 33:43.810
of physical altercation

33:43.844 --> 33:45.278
between him and the victim.

33:46.613 --> 33:47.848
The defense case?

33:47.881 --> 33:49.750
Well...

33:49.783 --> 33:51.685
it wasn't just a lie,

33:51.718 --> 33:53.419
it was a mess.

33:53.854 --> 33:55.556
They offered no proof,

33:55.589 --> 33:57.558
Detective Bowers
was the aggressor,

33:57.591 --> 34:00.433
no evidence
that there was a fight,

34:00.466 --> 34:02.102
no alternative theory

34:02.135 --> 34:04.137
even as to what happened.

34:04.938 --> 34:08.542
When the defense
is this muddled,

34:08.574 --> 34:11.011
it means one thing,

34:11.043 --> 34:12.779
there is no defense.

34:14.014 --> 34:16.149
The evidence of this case

34:16.181 --> 34:19.620
supports only one conclusion,

34:19.652 --> 34:22.656
the defendant
attacked the officer,

34:22.688 --> 34:24.625
took his gun,

34:24.658 --> 34:25.826
and murdered him.

34:36.969 --> 34:37.904
Last thoughts?

34:37.938 --> 34:39.172
Eugene, I got
to answer for this.

34:39.205 --> 34:40.607
The jury needs
to hear from me.

34:40.641 --> 34:42.175
The judge--Bob--

34:42.208 --> 34:43.677
Mr. Donnell...

34:43.710 --> 34:46.446
I believe Mr. Young
is closing today.

34:46.478 --> 34:47.781
I'm prepared to close,
Your Honor.

34:47.813 --> 34:48.748
Sidebar!

34:56.790 --> 34:59.325
I gave you an order,
you son of a bitch.

34:59.359 --> 35:01.401
The jury has no relationship
to Eugene Young.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.937
If I don't close,
it undermines my credibility.

35:03.970 --> 35:06.339
It undermines
my client's defense.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.308
You guarantee him
a new trial.

35:08.341 --> 35:09.876
He's got one
half-guaranteed already--

35:09.910 --> 35:10.877
You want me to do my job?

35:10.911 --> 35:11.878
Let me do it.

35:13.346 --> 35:15.181
I'll close you down
in a second if you--

35:15.215 --> 35:15.882
Thank you.

35:29.830 --> 35:31.965
The closing argument
is defense counsel's

35:31.998 --> 35:34.034
last chance to speak to you.

35:39.072 --> 35:41.575
When I began trying cases,

35:43.243 --> 35:45.546
I'd get nervous
before a closing.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.550
Lately, though,
I haven't felt nervous.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.219
I haven't felt anything,

35:55.088 --> 35:56.189
except maybe numb.

35:57.791 --> 35:59.492
What Ms. Gamble said
about the defense,

35:59.526 --> 36:00.400
she was right.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.569
It was muddled, terrible.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.038
The truth is,

36:05.071 --> 36:07.974
based on my client's record,

36:09.375 --> 36:10.677
his stupidity,

36:12.145 --> 36:14.447
I judged him guilty.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.382
It's the worst sin

36:16.416 --> 36:18.251
a lawyer can commit.

36:18.284 --> 36:20.821
My job...

36:20.854 --> 36:21.988
is to fight.

36:23.356 --> 36:25.358
I'm supposed to fight

36:25.391 --> 36:26.827
the power of the state.

36:27.628 --> 36:30.664
I'm supposed to fight
for justice.

36:30.697 --> 36:33.867
Mostly, I'm supposed
to fight for the defendant.

36:36.302 --> 36:37.604
I didn't do that.

36:39.439 --> 36:40.974
I don't feel anything
about that, either,

36:41.007 --> 36:44.745
except maybe tired, you know?

36:44.778 --> 36:47.480
I am sick and tired

36:47.514 --> 36:48.949
of fighting these cases

36:48.982 --> 36:51.718
for these clients
accused of these crimes.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.321
Somebody's got to do it,
I get that.

36:55.355 --> 36:57.323
But this time...

37:00.667 --> 37:03.737
this time,
it shouldn't have been me.

37:03.770 --> 37:05.639
To my client,
all I can say is,

37:06.940 --> 37:08.141
I'm sorry, you know.

37:08.174 --> 37:09.308
I--

37:10.744 --> 37:12.812
you got screwed.

37:13.379 --> 37:14.714
As for you,
members of the jury,

37:14.748 --> 37:16.415
the question is...

37:16.449 --> 37:19.385
did the evidence prove
beyond reasonable doubt

37:19.419 --> 37:22.388
that this man
committed murder?

37:23.557 --> 37:24.658
Clearly it didn't.

37:25.526 --> 37:26.760
Even with a half-assed defense,

37:26.793 --> 37:28.595
the prosecution can only guess

37:28.629 --> 37:30.931
at what happened.

37:30.964 --> 37:32.966
Nobody saw or heard anything.

37:32.999 --> 37:36.803
(chuckles) Can you imagine
how much doubt there'd be

37:36.837 --> 37:39.105
if Mr. Johnson
had a real defense?

37:43.076 --> 37:44.778
My client...

37:44.811 --> 37:47.413
says he got into a struggle

37:47.447 --> 37:49.816
with somebody who he thought

37:49.850 --> 37:52.052
was a drug dealer,

37:52.085 --> 37:53.820
and the gun went off
accidentally.

37:56.322 --> 38:01.001
He is a total piece of crap,

38:04.905 --> 38:06.573
but his version

38:06.607 --> 38:08.709
could be the truth.

38:14.748 --> 38:15.849
I don't know.

38:18.051 --> 38:20.987
(music playing)

38:27.628 --> 38:28.795
(sighs)

38:33.567 --> 38:35.101
Did I do
something wrong again?

38:35.135 --> 38:36.570
No, Jamie.

38:39.773 --> 38:42.442
I want to apologize
for the practical joke.

38:43.710 --> 38:45.445
I know I've been
a little rough on you,

38:45.478 --> 38:48.915
and I'm sorry for that, too.

38:50.316 --> 38:51.051
More importantly,

38:51.084 --> 38:52.853
I slipped into the courtroom,

38:52.886 --> 38:54.588
and I heard your closing.

38:55.288 --> 38:56.089
You did?

38:57.223 --> 38:58.925
I think you have real talent.

38:59.593 --> 39:00.901
I want you to know that,

39:00.934 --> 39:02.969
and I want you to know
that I know it.

39:08.074 --> 39:09.275
I feel like we should hug.

39:09.309 --> 39:10.877
We're not gonna hug,

39:10.911 --> 39:12.679
but...

39:12.713 --> 39:16.182
congratulations
on a well-earned victory.

39:16.216 --> 39:18.151
You'll be having
many more of them.

39:20.253 --> 39:21.522
(door opens)

39:21.555 --> 39:24.490
(music playing)

39:28.995 --> 39:30.631
Madam Foreperson...

39:30.664 --> 39:32.599
has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:33.433 --> 39:34.935
We have, Your Honor.

39:34.968 --> 39:36.837
The defendant will please rise.

39:41.107 --> 39:44.110
To the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:44.144 --> 39:44.811
how say you?

39:45.812 --> 39:49.049
We the jury find the defendant,
Earl Johnson,

39:50.116 --> 39:51.117
not guilty.

39:51.652 --> 39:52.553
(sighs)

39:53.754 --> 39:56.089
SWACKHEIM: To the charge
of murder in the second degree,

39:56.122 --> 39:57.090
how say you?

39:57.123 --> 40:00.834
We the jury find the defendant,
Earl Johnson,

40:01.902 --> 40:03.036
not guilty.

40:03.069 --> 40:04.538
(exhales sharply)
Thank you.

40:11.477 --> 40:13.313
I got to admit, Bobby,

40:13.346 --> 40:15.616
you were giving me
pause there,

40:15.649 --> 40:17.551
but like always
in the end,

40:17.584 --> 40:19.319
I walk out the door.

40:19.352 --> 40:22.723
Mr. Donnell, Mr. Young,
chambers, please.

40:31.965 --> 40:34.000
Congratulations.

40:34.034 --> 40:35.869
I'm sure you're feeling flushed
with victory.

40:38.271 --> 40:39.773
Bobby, I'm sitting you down.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.743
What are you talking about?

40:42.776 --> 40:44.110
SWACKHEIM:
You were extremely erratic

40:44.144 --> 40:45.546
during your rape trial.

40:45.579 --> 40:47.848
You were all over
the place here.

40:47.881 --> 40:49.315
You briefly even forgot
the crime

40:49.349 --> 40:51.184
which your client
was charged with.

40:51.217 --> 40:52.385
I won.

40:52.418 --> 40:53.587
Because the state
had no case,

40:53.620 --> 40:55.488
and the D. A. was too arrogant

40:55.522 --> 40:57.423
to charge manslaughter
in the alternative.

40:57.457 --> 40:58.559
You're right.

40:58.592 --> 40:59.526
You won.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.167
Which means
I can hardly take you

41:01.201 --> 41:02.703
to the board of bar overseers,

41:02.736 --> 41:04.505
they'd never
find you incompetent,

41:05.038 --> 41:08.074
but I can control
what happens in this building.

41:08.108 --> 41:09.309
As of now,

41:09.342 --> 41:11.177
you're retired from trials.

41:11.211 --> 41:13.046
I'll be calling
the chief judge shortly.

41:14.581 --> 41:15.982
You can't do this.

41:17.217 --> 41:19.452
I won't let you--
Right now, it's a month.

41:19.485 --> 41:22.589
Push me, I'll make it two.

41:22.623 --> 41:23.624
You're not well.

41:25.759 --> 41:27.728
Eugene, take him.

41:27.761 --> 41:30.463
(music playing)

41:37.003 --> 41:38.171
(door opens)

41:54.387 --> 41:56.256
The rest will be good.

41:58.692 --> 42:00.026
You think I've lost it?

42:01.835 --> 42:03.003
I think...

42:05.672 --> 42:06.840
that rape trial

42:06.873 --> 42:10.644
or whatever Father Martin
said to you

42:10.677 --> 42:13.279
really shook you, Bobby.

42:16.316 --> 42:18.451
I'm a criminal defense lawyer.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.089
It's not my fault
if he rapes again.

42:25.291 --> 42:26.593
I'm just a lawyer.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.128
It's not my fault.

42:29.963 --> 42:31.064
You need a rest.

42:31.798 --> 42:33.433
You're just tired.

42:33.834 --> 42:35.101
That's all, honey.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.572
You're just tired.

42:38.605 --> 42:41.542
(music playing)

42:59.760 --> 43:02.703
(music playing)

43:24.357 --> 43:25.458
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:27.293 --> 43:30.230
(music playing)
