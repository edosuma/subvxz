[Narrator] A dog in the
Cambridge English Dictionary

01:14.465 --> 01:17.642
is a domesticated
carnivorous mammal.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.035
That's me.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.169
Another kind of dog
is my ex-wife Tracy.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.694
She was shagging my best mate
and business partner, Jungle.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.305
They both were
conspiring against me.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.568
You promised me he'd
be out of the way by now.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.092
And he doesn't
even know about us.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.658
Look, woman,
it's being planned.

01:33.702 --> 01:36.139
This time next week, he'll be
a memory, a distant memory.

[glass shattering]

01:49.587 --> 01:51.198

01:51.241 --> 01:53.722
He would clean and launder
anything Jungle and I grabbed

01:53.765 --> 01:56.942
from shitty pawn shops
to high street banks.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.206
Terry's relationship
with the local hunters

01:59.249 --> 02:01.295
provided us the guns, the bikes,

02:01.338 --> 02:03.340
and we had the dogs
bollocks to do it.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.605
[Jungle] All right, Terry.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.607
Thought I'd come and
see you, me old mate.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.392
Oh, ain't I honored.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.189
Back to your racing, Terry.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.321

02:28.626 --> 02:31.151
[Byron] A week later
I arrived on my Tod.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.762
There was no Terry; he went
bloody greyhound racing.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.764
He'll be arriving
there right now.

02:41.030 --> 02:41.813
Where's the fight, Dave?

02:41.857 --> 02:43.641
Cut the bullshit.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.208
You stole our money.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.732
Pleased to see you too Dave.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.386
You on the fucking
juice again or what?

02:49.430 --> 02:51.345
Dave always thought Byron
was ripping the firm off.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.650
[Jungle] So,
who's your money on?

02:54.304 --> 02:55.827
100 quid on Byron to win.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.351
He'll sucker punch him
with that knuckle duster

02:57.394 --> 02:58.569
his dad gave him.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.180
That's his trademark,
you know that.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.485
But what you don't know,

03:01.529 --> 03:03.095
Dave's got a metal
plate in his jaw

03:03.139 --> 03:04.488
from that ruck we had
with them Birmingham lads.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.882
So, if you lose, you're
buying the Chinese and all.

You don't see the

That's a lode of

Two months a broken nose

05:28.545 --> 05:30.330
There's no trace on any of it.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.941
And I've contacted Dutch for ya.

a car business going,

Eastern Europe

07:47.771 --> 07:50.034
and driving them over to
the UK and then selling them

07:50.078 --> 07:52.559

13:02.477 --> 13:03.695
Marcello.

13:03.739 --> 13:04.784

brother, my sister,

13:09.440 --> 13:11.094

problem, you know?

13:12.052 --> 13:14.228
Fuck my life, or fuck my wife?

13:14.271 --> 13:15.272
Your wife, your wife!

13:15.316 --> 13:16.056
My wife?

13:16.099 --> 13:17.100
Yeah, fuck her.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.235
What the fuck's

13:21.278 --> 13:22.932
He's talking fucking shit.

13:22.976 --> 13:23.803
Fuck with your friend.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.847
Marcello!

13:24.891 --> 13:25.805
Marcello, look at me!

13:25.848 --> 13:26.980
You believe in this guy?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.372
Come on.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.765
Look at his
fucking eyes, Dave!

13:29.809 --> 13:32.072
Can't you see what he's
fucking trying to do?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.203
Look at him!

13:33.247 --> 13:34.248
Look at him!

13:36.424 --> 13:37.991
Don't believe this guy, man.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.862
[Byron] And never trust
an Australian pit bull

13:39.906 --> 13:41.472
who wants to be the
number one alpha.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.386
Fuck you!

13:42.430 --> 13:45.346
[shotgun blasting]

13:46.608 --> 13:48.001
Why the fuck did
you do that for?

13:49.741 --> 13:50.699
Huh?

13:50.742 --> 13:52.048
Did you fuck my wife?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.964
Dave, why would I
want to fuck your wife?

13:55.008 --> 13:55.791
Huh, why?

13:56.661 --> 13:58.663
You believe in this shit.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.231
How old are you?

14:01.275 --> 14:02.972
What's this?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.931
It's your little finger.

14:04.974 --> 14:05.975
What's this?

14:06.019 --> 14:06.758
You tell me.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.238
One mistake I made

14:08.282 --> 14:10.937
was leaving the gun
for Dave to destroy.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.286
And this how Jungle framed me.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.027
Take this get rid of it.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.334
[Terry] There's
been a robbery.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.162
It's all over the news.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.424
[Byron] Have I
been set up, Terry?

14:20.468 --> 14:22.426
[Terry] I don't
know right now, okay?

14:22.470 --> 14:24.385
It could be a murder wrap.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.386
A fucking murder rap?

14:25.429 --> 14:26.691
You taking the piss?

14:26.735 --> 14:27.823
What the fuck am I
meant to do, Terry?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.390
[Terry] Leave this with me.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.089
[phone beeps]

14:33.133 --> 14:36.745
Hey Kate, when are you gonna
get ass out of fucking bed?

14:36.788 --> 14:37.877
What the fuck am
I paying you for?

14:47.408 --> 14:50.019
What the fuck has
she been doing?

14:55.024 --> 14:55.895
Fucking slut!

15:01.074 --> 15:03.598
[cars honking]

15:03.641 --> 15:06.209
[intense music]

15:19.962 --> 15:21.137
Fucking bitch.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.016
What's going on?

15:30.059 --> 15:32.932
Where's my fucking
cards and money?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.934
Piss off, asshole!

15:34.977 --> 15:36.544
Where's my fucking cards?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.111
Hey, what the fuck
is going on here, mate?

15:38.154 --> 15:40.287
Got a fucking problem
with the girl or what?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.853
She's got my fucking money.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.333
Do yourself a favor, yeah?

15:43.377 --> 15:44.160
Fuck off.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.994
[grunts]

15:54.344 --> 15:55.128
No!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.960
Where's my fucking
cards and money?

16:02.570 --> 16:05.442
Where's my fucking
cards and money?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.445
Speak to Joe.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.272
Joe?

16:10.404 --> 16:11.971
Who the fuck is Joe?

16:13.668 --> 16:14.669
Boys Town.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.627
Boys Town?

16:16.671 --> 16:18.194
What the fuck is that shit?

16:18.238 --> 16:19.021
Huh?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.981
Go to Cockatoo Bar.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.382
Who's the wanker now?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.516
[spits]

16:41.043 --> 16:44.438
[soft electronic music]

16:46.440 --> 16:48.964
[thundering]

16:52.011 --> 16:54.839
[intense music]

17:45.586 --> 17:47.066
Hello, mate.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.502
Yeah, what do you need?

17:48.545 --> 17:50.678
I'm looking for the Cockatoo
Bar, a guy called Joe.

17:50.721 --> 17:51.592
Joe?

17:51.635 --> 17:52.767
Never heard of him.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.422
You sure?

17:55.465 --> 17:56.336
Yeah, sure.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.598
What do you need?

17:59.165 --> 18:03.082
Katie told me you could get
me some cards, some plastic.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.561
All right.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.216
Go straight, second
door on your left.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.348
Thanks.

18:08.391 --> 18:11.133
[energetic music]

18:22.275 --> 18:25.104
[intense music]

18:36.898 --> 18:38.769
[knocking]

18:38.813 --> 18:41.120
Yo, that would be our guest.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.865
I've come to see Joe.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.839
So, what can I do you for
in my house of ill repute?

19:04.882 --> 19:07.233
I can get you anything you need.

19:07.276 --> 19:10.279
I can get you Asian,
Caucasian, Eurasian,

19:10.323 --> 19:12.977
Australasian, Afrasian and for
the really truly disturbed,

19:13.021 --> 19:16.024
I can even get you youthanasian.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.679
And of course, there's
the specifics of it all.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.159
I mean, do you want a female?

19:21.638 --> 19:23.162
Male?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.337
Ladyboy?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.120
Tomboy?

19:25.164 --> 19:26.165
Homeboy?

19:26.208 --> 19:26.948
Cowboy?

19:26.991 --> 19:27.731
Playboy?

19:27.775 --> 19:28.515
Toyboy?

19:28.558 --> 19:29.385
Schoolboy?

19:31.735 --> 19:32.475
Atta boy!

19:34.477 --> 19:36.175
I feel obligated to
mention that we have

19:36.218 --> 19:38.351
a two-for-one special
on Manginas this week.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.831
It's a rarity in the market.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.095
So, welcome to Joe's
emporium of sleaze.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.403
Now, what do you want?

19:47.447 --> 19:49.666
Katie told me you
could get me some cards.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.538
Oh, drat.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.454
Here I was, thinking I
was about to get lucky.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.021
Kate you say.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.327
Oh, what a girl, huh?

19:58.371 --> 19:59.937
My top student.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.722
The best ass ever!

20:03.158 --> 20:04.855
My little anal angel.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.902
You need to teach her
to stay to cook breakfast.

20:07.945 --> 20:10.296
She says that to
all her customers.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.949
She's a shit cook anyway.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.342
She'd probably poison ya.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.301
Now, down to business.

20:16.911 --> 20:21.132
You're in the right
place at the right time.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.961
I just received a
bunch of new cards.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.225
And they're from the UK.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.184
This is what we call a
serendipitous encounter.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.317
Really?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.188
Some might even say kismet.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.363
Must be my lucky day.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.325
200,000 baht
and they're yours.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.414
I've got the cash
here with me right now.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.810
But do you ever mix
business with pleasure?

20:50.858 --> 20:51.815
You read my mind.

20:53.774 --> 20:57.038
I have been known to have a
predilection for beastly men.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.737
Are you a beastly man?

21:03.610 --> 21:04.350
This way.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.401
[cackling]

21:20.148 --> 21:22.106
I need to kiss you.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.327
And I like to be the giver
and not the receiver.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.896
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.201
Don't be gentle, darling.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.814
That's fine my me, sweetheart.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.166
[grunting]

21:39.036 --> 21:40.995
It's gonna be hard.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.997
Fuck me like you hate me!

21:43.040 --> 21:43.780
Close your eyes!

21:43.824 --> 21:45.391
Give it to me!

21:45.434 --> 21:47.523
Here it comes!

21:47.567 --> 21:49.264
[groaning]

21:49.308 --> 21:50.787
Fuck, fuck!

21:50.831 --> 21:53.312
[intense music]

22:08.762 --> 22:09.545
Oi!

22:09.589 --> 22:10.329
[grunts]

22:10.372 --> 22:12.722
[screaming]

22:16.770 --> 22:18.859
[Joe] You motherfucker!

22:21.862 --> 22:22.863
Cheers, mate.

22:22.906 --> 22:23.690
Cheers.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.522
I'm gonna kill you!

22:29.565 --> 22:32.351
[Joe screaming]

22:37.965 --> 22:39.662
[Byron] Now, you
can beat a dog,

22:39.706 --> 22:42.448
and it's gonna do
one of two things.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.406
One, it's gonna
roll over and die.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.278
Or two, it's gonna bite ya,

22:47.322 --> 22:49.368
Now, I'm the kind of dog
that's gonna bite ya.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.981
I snapped Dutch up on his offer

22:54.024 --> 22:56.549
and we went to his
beloved crocodile farm.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.551
I needed to talk some business.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.727
And of course,
recycle some meat.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.773
Wow, that one's bloody massive!

23:04.644 --> 23:06.210
That's nothing, man.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.429
There's much bigger one's here.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.387
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.739
You know, we feed them steroids.

23:12.782 --> 23:13.783
[Byron] You what?

23:13.827 --> 23:14.697
Steroids.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.308
In 12 months, they
grow from one feet

23:17.352 --> 23:19.659
to about 10 feet in no time.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.878
We give them double the amount
you normally give to humans.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.706
That's why they're so
fucking aggressive.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.142
Chinese love it.

23:25.186 --> 23:27.362
That's why it's a big market.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.929
Between you and me, ah?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.974
We have the reputation
here of supplying

23:31.018 --> 23:33.586
the best meat in all
of South East Asia.

23:33.629 --> 23:34.804
But come on, Dutch.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.719
Don't they test the meat?

23:36.763 --> 23:37.981
For that yearly test?

23:38.025 --> 23:38.939
Come on.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.723
You see that basin over there?

23:40.767 --> 23:41.724
Yeah.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.073
Those two crocodiles in there.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.685
Those are the ones which
are not on steroids.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.034
That's how we pass the test.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.601
Easy.

23:48.644 --> 23:51.299
All those fucking Yanks and
Aussies, they get big right.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.257
They don't even know why.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.433
Even when you do
that test, you know?

23:54.476 --> 23:55.434
That bodybuilding test.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.872
It doesn't show up;
it's not in the blood.

23:58.915 --> 23:59.699
You eat the meat.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.528
Makes sense.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.573
So how many do you
go through in a year?

24:04.617 --> 24:05.618
10,000.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.490
I'm gonna show you more.

24:08.534 --> 24:09.273
[Byron] God.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.629
So, Byron, this
is big business.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.633
Over there we have more
than a thousand crocodiles.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.460
Shit, really?

24:22.548 --> 24:23.549
What do you do with 'em?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
Handbags, jackets.

24:25.551 --> 24:26.856
Meat.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.858
Mostly we sell to
USA and Australia.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.860
We have a concept here.

24:30.904 --> 24:31.992
Nothing goes to waste.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.517
So even the off cuts we
feed back to the crocodiles.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.214
That's the meat like the most.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.478
[chuckling]

24:39.521 --> 24:40.783
Remember that Dutch
snack, frikandel?

24:40.827 --> 24:41.610
Yeah.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.655
Same concept.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.267
Sounds good, Dutch.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.574
You know, I'm into a
bit of recycling myself.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.185
[curious music]

25:24.653 --> 25:25.524
They love it.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.265
[uneasy music]

25:31.138 --> 25:34.097
[Byron] Dutch,
I got a problem.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.621
The other night, I
got my cards stolen.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.536
Now I've got limited cash.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.016
I'd like to take you
up on your offer.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.671
So now you want
to take up my offer?

25:42.715 --> 25:43.716
Great.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.456
How you get your
cards stolen, man?

25:45.500 --> 25:46.719
I slept with a hooker.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.636
I got drunk, and she
took everything I had.

25:50.679 --> 25:51.724
[speaking foreign language]

25:51.767 --> 25:53.377
You shut up, yeah.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.988
Okay, you report those cards
stolen to the bank, yeah.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.511
get them replaced in one day.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.251
It's solved.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.731
I can't do that.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.210
Those cards belong to Terry
if you know what I mean.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.647
Terry's cards?

26:02.561 --> 26:03.823
Byron, man.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.172
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

26:05.215 --> 26:07.174
You don't know Bangkok, do you?

26:07.217 --> 26:09.219
Tell me that fucking bar now.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.656
I went back there last night.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.527
There was no cards, no money.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.529
But I found out where they went.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.052
- [speaking foreign language]
- Let him talk, you fuck!

26:16.096 --> 26:16.879
You keep going.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.274
She was with some
English sexpat.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.319
He got a bit lippy,
so I knocked him out.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.584
But I found out
where the cards went.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.934
What did I tell you, man?

26:27.977 --> 26:30.023
You should come and
contact me first, yeah?

26:30.066 --> 26:34.941
[Byron] Look, they won't even
remember me, so don't worry.

26:34.984 --> 26:35.768
Okay.

26:37.378 --> 26:40.990
Byron, I want you to start
working tomorrow, yeah?

26:41.034 --> 26:42.601
I'm gonna drop Mariya off now.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.604
Tomorrow, you come to my
place in Sukhumvit, yeah?

26:45.647 --> 26:47.040
My villa.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.737
See you then.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.697
[dramatic music]

27:08.539 --> 27:11.455
I have had a girl
with two pussies, man.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.369
Two fucking pussies.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.067
She was sleeping sideways.

27:14.110 --> 27:17.461
I was maybe a little bit
drunk, but I saw two pussies.

27:17.505 --> 27:20.464
[chuckling]

27:20.508 --> 27:22.684
I guess you're making
a pretty penny here.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.207
We do, man.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.731
Well if that's the case,

27:25.774 --> 27:27.471
why are we stuck on
a shitty river boat

27:27.515 --> 27:28.821
and we're not driving
around Bangkok

27:28.864 --> 27:30.431
in some nice flashy motor?

27:30.474 --> 27:31.998
We stay low profile, man.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.087
Low profile is
the key, you know?

27:34.130 --> 27:36.829
If a cop see you in a car,
they're gonna pull you aside.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.179
They find all kind of
tricks to get money off you.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.006
It's not good.

27:40.049 --> 27:40.789
Now were free.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.095
Free men.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.792
But don't they need
a warrant for that?

27:43.836 --> 27:46.447
You know the salary of a cop
is about 10,000 baht a month.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.144
You'll see, near the
end of every month,

27:48.188 --> 27:49.450
they get very fanatic, ah?

27:49.493 --> 27:51.713
Making roadblocks,
and it's so obvious

27:51.757 --> 27:53.889
even the people
make jokes about it.

27:53.933 --> 27:54.803
Okay, I understand that.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.065
[Dutch] Yeah.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.632
But if your making
all this money,

27:57.676 --> 27:58.851
what are you doing with it?

27:58.894 --> 28:01.941
I have my investments
man, and more.

28:01.984 --> 28:02.724
And?

28:02.768 --> 28:03.769
Yellow fever.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.163
What's that?

28:07.207 --> 28:08.121
Thai girls.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.078
Asians pussy.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.472
[chuckling]

28:11.515 --> 28:12.865
Think you got it
already, Byron, I'm sure.

28:12.908 --> 28:13.822
Maybe.

28:13.866 --> 28:14.649
He's got it.

28:16.869 --> 28:17.652
Looks like it.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.393
[laughing]

28:19.436 --> 28:20.786
Oh yeah, that's clear.

28:20.829 --> 28:21.917
Let's get out of here.

28:41.415 --> 28:42.546
Always watch yourself.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.992
Yeah, man.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.211
You go to the airport
tonight, pick up that girl.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.822
Go Hong Kong two weeks.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.345
Then you go to Korea, got it?

28:58.388 --> 28:59.738
Hey, can I shag the girl?

29:00.869 --> 29:02.784
Shag the girl!

29:02.828 --> 29:03.785
Stay professional, yeah.

29:06.092 --> 29:06.875
Go!

29:10.444 --> 29:11.445
I can't believe it.

29:11.488 --> 29:12.881
Fuck!

29:12.925 --> 29:14.840
You can't trust your
own personnel anymore.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.757
[energetic electronic music]

29:26.503 --> 29:28.897
[screaming]

30:02.757 --> 30:03.540
Why Chinatown?

30:04.846 --> 30:06.848
We have an export
business as a front.

30:06.892 --> 30:10.721
Flip flops, umbrellas,
whatever you call it.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.375
Nobody bothers even
to question us.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.732
Blimey, Dutch.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.299
This place.

30:23.343 --> 30:24.779
It's a proper shit hole.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.087
It's deeper than your ass.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.402
Watch your head.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.319
So, here it is.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.803
Oh yeah, look at that.

30:52.938 --> 30:53.895
Perfect.

30:57.029 --> 31:00.859
Here we pack, dispatch steroids.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.252
Slimming tabs, some other stuff.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.428
I'm gonna tell you
about this later.

31:05.472 --> 31:06.516
I can tell you now.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.258
I'm too old to be
packing tablets.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.348
Terry asked me
to help you out.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.523
That's what I am doing.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.921
Tik, can you get us two beers?

31:20.966 --> 31:22.881
You okay with that?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.447
Time to talk some business.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.361
Take a seat, Byron.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.544
So then, Dutch, time is money.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.328
Tell me more.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.198
Okay, look.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.593
I got my network, yeah.

31:39.636 --> 31:40.420
Worldwide.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.988
With dealers and stuff.

31:43.031 --> 31:46.078
I buy the steroids from all
over the place here in Bangkok.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.341
From various chemists.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.820
Customer wires me the money.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.562
I'll dispatch it here.

31:52.606 --> 31:53.346
Simple.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.219
Okay.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.177
Oh yeah.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.353
So, what do you need me for?

32:00.396 --> 32:01.832
I want you...

32:05.097 --> 32:06.750
to expand my business.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.143
You're the right guy for that.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.277
Why me?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.104
Terry.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.280
He told me you made
your crew back home

32:14.323 --> 32:15.368
a fortune, didn't you?

32:15.411 --> 32:16.717
Yeah.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.762
Man, I think if
we work together...

32:20.939 --> 32:22.070
we can be a great team.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.553
Well, I plan on
staying a bit longer.

32:28.598 --> 32:29.382
Tell me more.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.732
Here we go.

32:34.474 --> 32:37.477
These little babies
here are Thai Pinks.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.262
This is five milligrams
of pure Anabol.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.265
Best seller in the whole market.

32:45.006 --> 32:48.140
Weightlifters, competition
lifters, whatever, movie stars.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.143
All of them.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.796
What do you think?

32:52.840 --> 32:56.452
What if I tell you you can gain
10 kilos in 10 fucking days?

32:57.671 --> 32:58.411
Pure muscle.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.283
This is what we feed
to the crocodiles.

33:02.415 --> 33:03.242
And I like it too.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.160
Dutch.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.900
I've been told about this stuff.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.206
It shrinks your balls.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.384
Well, you know.

33:16.603 --> 33:19.301
We have a counter
hormone to balance that.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.563
All right?

33:20.607 --> 33:21.912
Also, some slimming
tabs and stuff.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.002
So, for every problem
we have a solution.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.917
There's many problems
in the world.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.964
That's why we have
a lot of business.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.749
We have many
businesses from now on.

33:32.793 --> 33:35.143
Sounds like a good business.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.536
Yeah, it is.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.495
Well, those counter
hormones, here's one of them.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.323
You need to take them.

33:41.367 --> 33:42.150
If not...

33:44.457 --> 33:46.024
roid rage, heart attacks.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.201
You can even grow some tits, ah?

33:49.244 --> 33:52.030
I had a customer last
time, he came back to me.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.683
Big problem.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.555
He had a left tit
growing, Byron.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.819
Looked like a fucking hamburger.

33:58.862 --> 33:59.820
You won't believe it.

33:59.863 --> 34:00.995
I was shocked too.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.388
I've seen many
things in my life.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.171
But it was big!

34:04.781 --> 34:06.218
And he asked me like, "Why?"

34:06.261 --> 34:08.045
I said, "Well, you didn't
follow my advice, you know?"

34:08.089 --> 34:09.395
[chuckles]

34:09.438 --> 34:10.612
You live and learn, right?

34:10.657 --> 34:12.353
He didn't have money for this.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.225
Well.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.487
Then...

34:14.530 --> 34:15.313
All right.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.146
Jimmy.

34:21.188 --> 34:22.060
Where are you now?

34:25.846 --> 34:27.239
Who's walking up here?

34:27.282 --> 34:28.370
There's nobody coming.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.242
My place?

34:31.721 --> 34:32.983
You sure?

34:33.027 --> 34:35.072
[shouting]

34:36.552 --> 34:38.728
What's this, the boys brigade?

34:38.772 --> 34:40.556
You bad man!

34:40.600 --> 34:41.469
I remember you!

34:41.514 --> 34:42.862
Your one of Joe's guys, right?

34:42.906 --> 34:44.821
[tense music]

34:44.864 --> 34:46.257
You know each other?

34:46.301 --> 34:47.563
I had a problem with his boss.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.391
I told you at the
crocodile farm.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.175
You mean Joe?

34:50.217 --> 34:51.219
What's this?

34:53.569 --> 34:55.223
Hello.

34:55.266 --> 34:57.791
Joe's in intensive care
having his stump sorted out.

34:57.834 --> 34:58.574
Yeah?

35:00.228 --> 35:02.970
Well, next time I'll chop
your fucking bollocks off.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.319
And I feed you them!

35:05.451 --> 35:06.452
Calm down.

35:06.495 --> 35:07.453
Joe!

35:07.496 --> 35:08.323
Nah, it ain't Joe!

35:08.367 --> 35:09.977
It's Bow.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.065
Don't worry about bow, you mug.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.327
It's me innit.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.068
You know Joe's got
the DEA in his pocket.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.417
Your fucked!

35:15.461 --> 35:17.245
Okay.

35:17.289 --> 35:18.116
Then bring it on.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.774
[grunting]

35:25.906 --> 35:28.126
[shouting]

35:28.169 --> 35:29.997
I make some Thai noodle soup.

35:30.040 --> 35:30.824
Okay!

35:32.086 --> 35:34.132
[shouting]

35:40.312 --> 35:41.226
You fucked up,

35:44.229 --> 35:46.753
You bring Mariya upstairs
to Mr. Wang's office, yeah?

35:46.796 --> 35:48.146
[Byron] Thai wives
are known for cutting

35:48.189 --> 35:49.843
their cheating
husbands' dicks off.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.323
I did the same thing to him.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.501
I'll get back to you.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.767
[Byron] I was in a
city of 8,281,000 people.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.292
The world is a small place.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.208
Six degrees of separation is
the idea that all living things

36:07.252 --> 36:09.558
are six degrees away
from each other.

36:09.602 --> 36:12.170
That quote is right.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.868
Dutch and Joe were
old business partners.

36:14.911 --> 36:17.044
That was until Joe
wanted to go his way.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.742
[dramatic music]

36:22.310 --> 36:24.182
[grunts]

36:30.275 --> 36:34.757
You remember what I used
to be famous for don't ya?

37:08.835 --> 37:10.576
You crazy fucking bastard!

37:10.619 --> 37:13.579
What did I tell you about
stepping on peoples toes here, ah?

37:13.622 --> 37:15.320
I didn't know you
fucking knew him!

37:15.363 --> 37:17.191
It's good to stir the pot.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.366
Stir the pot, yeah?

37:18.410 --> 37:20.368
Things go from bad to worse!

37:20.412 --> 37:23.066
There's powerful people
going to his place!

37:23.110 --> 37:24.242
This ain't over yet!

37:25.982 --> 37:26.766
Calm down.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.290
You know what?
[slaps]

37:29.334 --> 37:31.336
I did you favor.

37:31.379 --> 37:34.295
I cut his measly little
fucking dick off.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.775
Now you've got a reputation.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.777
Reputation!

37:37.820 --> 37:40.258
[Byron] Well, here it
is, ladies and gentlemen.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.477
The classic signs of roid rage.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.045
Yes, I make sure
everybody knows about it!

37:45.088 --> 37:46.351
Everybody!

37:46.394 --> 37:47.656
[Byron] Good.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.181
It's good, right?

37:51.225 --> 37:53.445
You cut fucking
gay Jo's dick off!

37:53.488 --> 37:56.230
[Byron] Salivating at the
mouth, profusely sweating,

37:56.274 --> 37:59.146
and dilated pupils like
bloody flying saucers.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.150
This roid rage storm will
clear as quick as it came.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.152
Just you watch.

38:05.195 --> 38:07.459
I don't believe it.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.243
I don't believe it.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.462
You've got some balls, man.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.901
Forget about it.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.338
Let's celebrate.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.383
Come.

38:18.426 --> 38:19.993
Fuck that guy.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.777
[Byron] It's better
to be a wolf for a day

38:21.821 --> 38:23.344
than a sheep all your life.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.305
I need to get big,
man, I need to get big.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.393
My fucking bird
is moaning at me,

38:28.436 --> 38:30.351
and I need to get
big, fucking big.

38:30.395 --> 38:32.310
So, guys I just
sent you 1,000 quid.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.400
I wanna gain 40 kilos,
otherwise she's gonna leave me.

38:35.443 --> 38:36.618
Can you do it?

38:40.970 --> 38:42.494
[Byron] So, Dutch
put a leash on me.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.452
And we went on the
straight and narrow.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.498
We created one of the
biggest underground

38:46.541 --> 38:48.413
steroid dealerships
on the planet.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.027
Everything was
smelling of roses.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.595
And the first thing we did
was get down to business.

38:56.638 --> 39:00.468
We set up a chain of high-tech
distribution units the city.

39:00.512 --> 39:04.472
Then we sent out free
samples to dealers worldwide.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.039
Once they were happy
with the stock,

39:06.082 --> 39:08.041
we undercut the competition.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.738
We had some amazing
ways of getting

39:09.782 --> 39:11.523
the gear through customs.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.742
Wrapping the gear
in carbon paper

39:13.786 --> 39:17.224
distorts the hidden object
to avoid X-ray detection.

39:17.267 --> 39:18.486
It's a bit like lead.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.923
But it's a lot lighter
and a lot cheaper.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.362
Now that is Bird.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.667
She was high as
a kite every day.

39:25.711 --> 39:26.538
She loved her fucking job.

39:26.581 --> 39:27.800
[knocking]

39:27.843 --> 39:30.106
She was our number
one packer from Burma.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.326
We took out the ink
cartridges in marker pens

39:32.370 --> 39:34.589
and replaced them
with our own gear.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.069
Teddy bears were good too.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.985
Another amazing way
of sending the gear

39:39.028 --> 39:41.901
was crushing the tabs
in toothpaste powder.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.293
The customers didn't mind it.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.643
They even brushed
their teeth in it.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.819
You know, there's nothing
like a bit of fluoride

39:46.862 --> 39:47.994
mixed with steroids.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.520
Sending it disguised
as vitamins.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.217
We just took out
the vitamin tablets

39:54.261 --> 39:57.046
and replaced it with our
own brand of vitamin C.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.135
Then we just
heat-sealed the lid,

39:59.179 --> 40:01.660
with our high-tech
machinery of course.

40:01.703 --> 40:04.967
For the injectables we
disguised it as anal sex lube.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.494
Our orders were going out
on an industrial scale.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.497
Not only that, our reputation

40:12.540 --> 40:15.021
was beginning to
get known worldwide.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.458
Those steroid freaks were
getting bigger and bigger.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.678
And the bigger they got,
the more juice they needed.

40:19.721 --> 40:21.244
It was a win-win situation.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.333
Now, I'm not talking
bollocks here.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.901
The steroid trade is as
big as the drug trade.

40:25.945 --> 40:28.469
But it's not frowned
upon so much by society.

40:28.513 --> 40:32.430
But in reality, those guys
are drug addicts with muscles.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.432
All right, Byron.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.868
We're gonna need some gear.

40:35.911 --> 40:36.782
[Byron] What you up to then?

40:36.825 --> 40:38.087
I got a big order for ya.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.002
The euros are coming up.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.700
I need something that's
gonna give the boys

40:41.743 --> 40:43.397
a lot of power and anger.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.529
[Byron] I'll give
you a horse steroid.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.836
[horse neighing]

40:47.880 --> 40:49.751
We supplied everyone
from fitness coaches

40:49.795 --> 40:52.624
to biker gangs to football
hooligans to celebrities.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.539
We supplied everyone worldwide,

40:54.582 --> 40:58.238
from Sydney to
Kabul, Afghanistan.

40:58.281 --> 41:01.676
Hey, I'm gonna need you to
send me another hundred,

41:01.720 --> 41:04.026
hundred bottles of testosterone,
like you did before.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.419
- Okay?
- Fantastic.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.466
Send it to my
office here in Kabul.

41:09.728 --> 41:13.122
APO that shit to me
like you did before.

41:18.258 --> 41:21.043
[muffled gunfire]

41:25.178 --> 41:25.961
God damn!

41:26.005 --> 41:27.876
These motherfuckers.

41:27.920 --> 41:28.703
All right.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.402
The insurgence just
broke the perimeter.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.578
I gotta go.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.709
I'll talk to you later.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.406
Bye.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.539
[Byron] Dutch invested in
a chain of massage parlors,

41:38.583 --> 41:41.673
knocking shops, crocodile
shops and a few other things.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.065
I was a bit more modest.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.980
I had money coming in
from all directions.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.591
I bought myself a
couple of condos,

41:46.634 --> 41:48.506
invested in a speed
boat business,

41:48.549 --> 41:49.898
and had my own car dealership.

41:54.686 --> 41:57.384
[phone buzzing]

41:57.427 --> 41:58.820
I have these
Armenian customers!

41:58.864 --> 42:00.953
I need 50,000 Thai Pinks!

42:00.996 --> 42:01.997
Yeah?

42:02.041 --> 42:02.911
And can you make me this deal,

42:02.955 --> 42:04.870
like I buy one, one for free?

42:04.913 --> 42:06.654
I'm sorry, I'm busy, man.

42:06.698 --> 42:07.960
Come on, man!

42:08.003 --> 42:09.222
Look it, I heard you
have this fucking deal

42:09.265 --> 42:10.658
of a one plus one.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.138
I buy one, I get
one for free, right?

42:12.181 --> 42:13.226
Last time, you did that.

42:13.269 --> 42:14.140
Can you do it again?

42:14.183 --> 42:15.707
I have 50,000.

42:15.750 --> 42:18.840
Not 10, not 20,
50-motherfucking-thousand!

42:18.884 --> 42:19.667
Can you give me that?

42:19.711 --> 42:21.408
Let's do it tomorrow.

42:21.451 --> 42:22.627
Okay,

42:22.670 --> 42:23.236
So, deal, tomorrow,
nine o'clock.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.019
See you, man.

42:26.456 --> 42:27.936
[Byron] Everything
was going great.

42:27.980 --> 42:31.766
But unknown to us, there were
some new kids on the block.

42:31.810 --> 42:34.682
And they were as corrupt as us.

42:34.726 --> 42:37.685
[fireworks booming]

42:41.689 --> 42:43.735
The next day, Dutch went to meet

42:43.778 --> 42:46.607
these so-called
Armenian dingoes.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.609
He'd thought he'd won
the bloody lottery.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.790
The Devil doesn't come to you
with a red face and horns.

42:55.834 --> 42:59.402
He comes to you as
everything you ever wanted.

42:59.446 --> 43:01.927
[intense music]

43:01.970 --> 43:04.320
[grunting]

43:36.614 --> 43:39.225
If something smells like
shit, you know it's bad.

43:39.268 --> 43:41.357
Dutch got his arse
kicked by Somchai,

43:41.401 --> 43:42.750
a Korean ridgeback.

43:42.794 --> 43:44.317
DEA inspector.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.797
A man of few words.

43:50.279 --> 43:52.891
Yes, I'm in the kennels now.

43:52.934 --> 43:55.981
So, whatever happens, don't
go back to that factory.

43:56.024 --> 43:57.591
It's the DEA.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.420
DEA is on it, man, all the time.

44:01.682 --> 44:03.641
So, what you do now,
you go to Sukhumvit 101,

44:03.684 --> 44:05.512
make some deal with
them, work it out.

44:06.731 --> 44:07.775
Don't let me down, Byron.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.692
Okay, man, I'm counting on you.

44:13.085 --> 44:14.521
Okay.

44:14.564 --> 44:15.653
Do your best.

44:16.828 --> 44:18.220
Here, you fucker.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.854
[Byron] So, I made
myself spick and span

44:42.897 --> 44:45.160
and went to the grooming saloon.

44:45.204 --> 44:48.947
I had an important meeting
with a DEA officer.

44:51.036 --> 44:53.386
[knocking]

44:56.128 --> 44:58.173
But before I left,
Mariya gave me

44:58.217 --> 45:00.741
a very special pair of glasses.

45:00.785 --> 45:02.830
Made in China, of course.

45:37.169 --> 45:38.692
Did I tell you to sit down?

45:40.389 --> 45:41.173
Where's Dutch?

45:42.914 --> 45:45.655
Dutch is locked in a cage
where he fucking belongs.

45:49.311 --> 45:51.574
So how do we release
the dog from the cage?

45:53.794 --> 45:56.144
You boys think you real
fucking cute, don't ya?

45:57.363 --> 45:59.887
Building your little
steroid empire.

45:59.931 --> 46:01.846
You're not paying
your fucking dues!

46:03.064 --> 46:05.545
You also didn't have
a good firewall.

46:05.588 --> 46:07.025
Didn't think about that, did ya?

46:07.068 --> 46:10.898
Untraceable payments
via cryptic currencies.

46:10.942 --> 46:12.900
Steroids...

46:12.944 --> 46:13.596
is a felony.

46:15.076 --> 46:17.862
Your boy's gonna serve some
fucking serious hard time.

46:20.734 --> 46:21.953
New kids on the block, eh?

46:24.303 --> 46:25.608
Snap this fool.

46:28.350 --> 46:31.136
[camera clicking]

46:31.179 --> 46:32.093
There's nothing on him.

46:32.137 --> 46:32.877
How's your jaw?

46:32.920 --> 46:33.878
Shut up, you wanker.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.537
I admire you.

46:43.104 --> 46:45.933
Big fucking basketball-sized
balls on ya.

46:47.935 --> 46:48.806
You're British, right?

46:49.894 --> 46:50.764
Yeah.

46:50.808 --> 46:51.939
Where abouts are you from?

46:53.158 --> 46:54.855
The Isle of Dogs.

46:54.899 --> 46:55.943
That's cute.

46:55.987 --> 46:57.945
More like Isle of Pussies.

46:57.989 --> 47:00.513
[chuckling]

47:00.556 --> 47:01.949
I always admire you British.

47:02.907 --> 47:05.213
So fucking pompous.

47:05.257 --> 47:06.258
So arrogant.

47:08.651 --> 47:10.044
Think you own the fucking world.

47:11.350 --> 47:13.874
But one thing I like
about the British...

47:13.918 --> 47:14.919
is your pound sterling.

47:16.224 --> 47:17.878
"We don't want the fucking euro.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.140
"We'll keep our pound sterling."

47:19.184 --> 47:20.838
That was good, that was clever.

47:22.883 --> 47:23.884
Tell ya what.

47:25.103 --> 47:26.408
I'm gonna make you a deal.

47:28.628 --> 47:33.546
You've got five days
to bring me 800,000...

47:34.764 --> 47:37.332
of those beloved,
British pound sterling.

47:38.943 --> 47:41.946
And then I'll let your
little mutt out of its cage.

47:41.989 --> 47:42.860
No problem.

47:45.950 --> 47:46.864
Minus...

47:48.474 --> 47:50.693
his shit hole apartments,

47:50.737 --> 47:53.131
his stupid fucking
crocodile farm,

47:54.349 --> 47:56.917
his dirty little
soapy massage parlors,

47:58.136 --> 48:00.790
and he's banned
from the Big Mango.

48:02.531 --> 48:05.491
His Bangkok privileges
are revoked.

48:05.534 --> 48:06.318
You what?

48:07.536 --> 48:08.886
You heard me.

48:08.929 --> 48:09.756
Five days.

48:10.931 --> 48:12.019
800k.

48:14.892 --> 48:15.980
Fetch.

48:16.023 --> 48:17.024
Time to go.

48:27.513 --> 48:29.080
Hurry up!

48:29.123 --> 48:29.907
See you soon, Chinney.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.821
Fuck off, you wanker!

48:32.648 --> 48:33.911
Clock's ticking, Byron.

48:35.390 --> 48:36.739
Five days!

48:46.271 --> 48:48.795
Let's cheers to
that, boys, 800k.

48:48.838 --> 48:50.536
No fucking chance
he's gonna get it.

48:56.716 --> 48:58.761
Remember the man who can?

48:58.805 --> 49:02.287
Two years ago, he renamed
me as Jimmy Harrison.

49:02.330 --> 49:05.029
Where there's an English
Dog, there's a way.

49:05.072 --> 49:08.075
I had four and half days to
get back to Connors with 800k.

49:09.163 --> 49:12.079
[dramatic music]

49:32.839 --> 49:34.014
All right, Terry.

49:34.058 --> 49:34.797
New motor?

49:34.841 --> 49:36.147
Yeah.

49:36.190 --> 49:38.018
And they say crime doesn't
pay, eh? [chuckles]

49:38.062 --> 49:41.543
I'm not staying for
long, only a few days.

49:41.587 --> 49:42.544
I need some weapons.

49:44.155 --> 49:44.851
Tomorrow.

49:55.253 --> 49:57.995
That afternoon, I went
to see my ex-beloved Tracy.

50:01.520 --> 50:03.000
I was going to tell
her a load of bollocks

50:03.043 --> 50:04.175
and spin her a yarn.

50:21.627 --> 50:22.454
All right, Tracy.

50:23.324 --> 50:24.543
Long time no see.

50:24.586 --> 50:25.805
What the fuck
are you doing here?

50:27.024 --> 50:28.286
Pleased to see
you too, darling.

50:29.417 --> 50:31.028
What are you doing back?

50:31.071 --> 50:33.030
If Jungle finds out,
he won't be easy on you

50:33.073 --> 50:34.727
like he was the last time.

50:34.770 --> 50:36.598
And you know the Old Bill
are after as well, right?

50:36.642 --> 50:38.426
I'm not worried about them.

50:38.470 --> 50:40.515
I got a new identity
thanks to a friend.

50:40.559 --> 50:43.040
What's your new
name then, James Bond?

50:44.737 --> 50:46.956
I'm back here for
a short holiday.

50:48.393 --> 50:50.438
I've come back to get my cash.

50:50.482 --> 50:52.136
Some things never change, eh?

50:52.179 --> 50:53.963
I haven't got any of your cash.

50:54.007 --> 50:55.443
The Old Bill took it all.

50:55.487 --> 50:58.142
And any little bits that
were left behind you owed me.

51:02.972 --> 51:04.235
You can't take the chip shop

51:04.278 --> 51:05.627

you, Tracy, eh?

51:05.671 --> 51:06.585
Fuck off.

51:09.066 --> 51:12.069
And now it's time to
pull on the heart strings.

51:12.112 --> 51:13.461
What happened to us?

51:13.505 --> 51:15.202
Listen, it hasn't been
easy for me, you know.

51:16.682 --> 51:19.119
I didn't expect them to
do what they did to you.

51:21.295 --> 51:23.036
I didn't know anything about it.

51:25.908 --> 51:28.128
Well I'm not here to
cry over spilled milk.

51:29.695 --> 51:31.392
What's done is done.

51:31.436 --> 51:33.438
In many ways it did me a favor.

51:35.353 --> 51:38.399
But I'm back to get some
cash for a new business deal.

51:38.443 --> 51:40.053
You're not getting
anything from me.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.620
You used to spend
my money like water.

51:41.663 --> 51:43.752
Well, why are you
here bothering me, then?

51:43.796 --> 51:46.277
Because I still care about ya.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.495
And I wanted to see ya.

51:49.541 --> 51:51.064

come and join me.

52:03.685 --> 52:05.861
But first I need to sort
out some business here.

52:07.211 --> 52:08.429
Well, where you gonna
get the cash from then?

52:08.473 --> 52:10.083
Now it's shit-stirring time.

52:11.345 --> 52:12.607
I buried some cash years ago

52:12.651 --> 52:14.566
with a deal I did with Jungle.

52:14.609 --> 52:15.349
From a robbery.

52:16.568 --> 52:18.222
Where?

52:18.265 --> 52:19.527
It's for me to know
and you to find out.

52:19.571 --> 52:20.572
How much?

52:20.615 --> 52:21.964
Six figures.

52:22.008 --> 52:23.227
You never told me
anything about that.

52:23.270 --> 52:25.359
I know better than that Tracy.

52:25.403 --> 52:26.143
You know that.

52:28.275 --> 52:31.017
And I need you to set up
a meeting with Dodgy Dave.

52:31.060 --> 52:31.844
Why should I?

52:33.367 --> 52:36.283
Because I'm gonna
give you half the money.

52:38.155 --> 52:39.373
Half the money, Tracy.

52:43.290 --> 52:44.030
All right.

52:45.727 --> 52:48.600
He'll be at the old warehouse
at 1:00 pm on Friday.

52:48.643 --> 52:51.211
They've got a scheduled
drop off that day.

52:51.255 --> 52:53.648
He'll be on the second
floor in the toilets.

52:53.692 --> 52:55.476
That sounds like Dave.

52:55.520 --> 52:58.044
Don't forget he's
got jaws of steel.

52:58.087 --> 52:59.915
I'm not worried about that.

52:59.959 --> 53:03.005

53:03.049 --> 53:04.833
I'm gonna give him

53:04.877 --> 53:07.706

he'll never forget.

53:07.749 --> 53:08.533

53:18.151 --> 53:21.502

where he hid that gun.

53:21.546 --> 53:23.156

53:23.200 --> 53:24.549
The gun he stitched me
up in that bloody robbery.

53:27.813 --> 53:28.727
Okay.

53:28.770 --> 53:29.858
I'll try and find out.

Did he have to say anything?

54:34.575 --> 54:35.272
Not much.

Terry, is involved somehow.

Connors had a paddy, and
he knew he'd fucked up.

01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:09.483
He thought sleeping
dogs would lie.

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:12.530
In life, you gotta
let go of your fears

01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:14.706
and chase your dreams.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:15.968
When you make a
mistake, there are only

01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:18.754
three things you should
ever do about it.

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:22.279
Admit it, learn from it,
and don't bloody repeat it.

01:19:23.889 --> 01:19:25.499
Mistakes have the power
to turn you into something

01:19:25.543 --> 01:19:26.762
better than you were before.

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:33.507
When it's all said and done,
and push comes to shove,

01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:35.771
the underdog takes
over the pack.

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:39.513
[intense electronic music]

01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:48.784
[sawing]

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:56.922
You gotta recycle the
present to save the future.

01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:06.366
Kill them with success and
bury them with a smile.

01:20:08.934 --> 01:20:11.023
Now mongrels that
create their own drama

01:20:11.067 --> 01:20:12.459
deserve their own karma.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:27.170
If they stand beside
you, you respect them.

01:20:27.213 --> 01:20:30.826
If they stand against
you, you recycle them.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:33.437
[intense music]

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:46.493
But that's another story
in the dogs days of glory.

01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:59.071
I went back to form a
new breed of English Dog.

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:02.466
But first, I had to deal
with a couple younger runts.

01:21:11.518 --> 01:21:14.870
You're probably expecting
me to say I found Jesus

01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:16.828
and I learned how to forgive,

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.656
or I started on
a different path.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.312
One more righteous,
and respected.

01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:24.575
But the truth is, fuck that.

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:26.664
You can't teach an
old dog new tricks.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:50.862
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.124
I wanna see a man about a dog!

01:21:52.168 --> 01:21:53.952
[intense electronic music]

01:22:44.671 --> 01:22:49.671
