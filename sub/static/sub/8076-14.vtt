believe that great guy

10:50.483 --> 10:53.586
was in that crappy movie?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.455
I believe we know a
lot of the same stuff.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
I bet.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.393
So, Scorsese, what kind of
films are you going to make?

11:00.427 --> 11:01.762
Thinking
documentaries, because I

11:01.795 --> 11:03.463
just like turning on
the camera in my house

11:03.496 --> 11:04.631
and seeing what I get.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.366
It's way better than
anything I could think of.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.534
I love documentaries.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.236
Have you seen
"Brother's Keeper?"

11:09.269 --> 11:10.470
It's amazing.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.906
So, of course, it didn't
get nominated for an Oscar.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.241
Of course.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.610
Yeah, I think those Oscars
are all politics, anyway.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.678
They totally suck.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.380
I mean, it's just
one big fashion show.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.816
It has nothing to do
with serious filmmaking.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.785
Yeah, I just sit there
watching it every year going,

11:24.818 --> 11:25.618
man, this bites!

11:28.488 --> 11:30.523
Have you seen "Microcosmos?"

11:30.557 --> 11:32.059
No, is it about
something small?

11:32.092 --> 11:35.729
No, it's this amazing
documentary about insects.

11:35.763 --> 11:36.830
I mean, the people
that made it--

11:36.864 --> 11:38.198
they made their
own special cameras

11:38.231 --> 11:40.267
so that they could film the
insects from really close up.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.601
- No way!
- OK?

11:41.634 --> 11:42.970
There's this lady bug, and
she's walking on a limb, right?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.738
And the ants are on
the limb, too, OK?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.506
So the ants start,
like, freaking out!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.141
And like they try
to get the lady bug,

11:48.175 --> 11:49.342
dude, but she kind
of just closes

11:49.376 --> 11:50.744
herself inside her shell.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.579
And then there are these
two bees in there, like,

11:52.612 --> 11:54.147
right there!
- No way!

11:54.181 --> 11:56.316
And it's like there are these
two huge rhino beetles that

11:56.349 --> 11:57.417
get into this really big fight.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.585
Oh.

11:58.618 --> 12:03.323

best part has the hottest,

12:03.356 --> 12:05.993

You just have to
see it for yourself.

sometime and watch it.

then I heard film school
