00:57.623 --> 00:59.124
hi, ma. Hmm.

00:59.191 --> 01:02.894
Where's Michael? Oh, he's upstairs,
trying to fix the toilet

01:03.662 --> 01:05.797
oh.

01:05.865 --> 01:10.301
What's wrong with it? Well,
it keeps makin' funny noises.

01:10.369 --> 01:13.671
Maybe the little man in the row
boat got an outboard motor.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.675
[Laughing] Oh, no.

01:17.743 --> 01:20.712
See, the water goes down

01:20.779 --> 01:22.280
and it keeps runnin'.

01:22.348 --> 01:24.916
And to fill the tank, you gotta reach in

01:24.984 --> 01:28.619
and pull up that big
metal ball and hold it.

01:28.687 --> 01:31.756
But nobody's got time to hold it all day.

01:32.992 --> 01:35.426
Ma, why didn't you call the plumber?

01:35.494 --> 01:39.631
Oh, no, Archie says plumbers
charge more than doctors

01:39.698 --> 01:42.501
for house calls. $18.

01:42.568 --> 01:44.402
Well, then, let's call a doctor.

01:44.470 --> 01:47.004
[Chuckling] Oh.

01:47.072 --> 01:49.307
Oh, Mike, did you fix it?

01:49.342 --> 01:51.843
Well, I tied up the metal
ball so that it just floats.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.345
But now you got to untie it,
every time you wanna flush it.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.650
Hello? And here I am.

01:58.717 --> 02:00.752
Everything's ok. There ain't
nothin' to worry about.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.054
Everything's ok. There ain't
nothin' to worry about.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.655
Archie! What's the matter?

02:04.723 --> 02:06.424
Oh, Edith, Edith, Edith. None of them

02:06.491 --> 02:08.559
"how was your day's" or
"whoop-Dee-woo's" tonight.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.627
Edith, here. Take my coat.

02:10.696 --> 02:13.898
This ain't one of your slight-hearted
occasions here this evening.

02:13.966 --> 02:15.967
Come here to me, my little girl.

02:16.835 --> 02:18.002
Get over here.

02:21.874 --> 02:25.142
You know, you--you nearly
lost your daddy today.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.644
Why? What happened?

02:26.712 --> 02:28.813
It's all right, Gloria, he's just fine--

02:28.881 --> 02:32.850
what do you mean "fine"? I ain't
fine, I'm anything but fine.

02:32.918 --> 02:34.552
Tell 'em what happened there, stretch.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.454
Uh, he nearly got himself killed at work.

02:36.555 --> 02:37.789
And that's what you call fine?

02:37.856 --> 02:39.991
I nearly got myself killed today at work.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.193
Oh, daddy, are you hurt
? (Mike) Archie, are you ok?

02:42.261 --> 02:44.195
Archie, what happened? You know...

02:44.263 --> 02:46.998
A whole crate of machine parts

02:47.066 --> 02:49.568
fell off the crane and
missed him by that much.

02:49.635 --> 02:53.038
Get outta here. It missed
me by this here much.

02:53.105 --> 02:55.506
Yeah, another inch, we could've
mailed him home in an envelope.

02:55.574 --> 02:57.541
[Laughing]

02:57.609 --> 02:58.876
Where's my lunch box?

02:58.944 --> 03:00.945
Bring the lunch here,
let me show them this.

03:01.012 --> 03:03.815
This is my lunch box, I brought home.

03:06.518 --> 03:09.587
How would you like it if I walked
in the door lookin' like that?

03:11.256 --> 03:13.758
Oh, Archie!

03:13.826 --> 03:16.060
Are you sure you ain't hurt?

03:16.127 --> 03:17.429
Oh, not a scratch.

03:17.496 --> 03:19.764
Me and Irene just rode him home
in the subway 'cause old arch

03:19.832 --> 03:21.466
was like this... You know?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.369
Yeah, and that was after he'd calmed down.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.504
Thank you, both of you,
for bringin' him home.

03:26.572 --> 03:30.007
Hey, hey, stretch come way out
of his way to come home with me.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.477
They--they don't make
guys like him no more.

03:32.511 --> 03:34.145
No, not since my father died.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.514
[Laughing]

03:36.582 --> 03:38.215
[Laughing]

03:38.284 --> 03:39.618
Laugh, will ya?

03:40.852 --> 03:44.155
[Laughing]

03:44.222 --> 03:48.225
Oh, Archie, I'm so glad you're safe.

03:48.293 --> 03:50.895
It's a miracle, Edith,
that I wasn't killed.

03:50.963 --> 03:52.931
Yeah, it sure was. And lucky for me, too.

03:52.998 --> 03:54.165
'Cause I ain't got a black suit.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.966
[Laughing]

03:57.770 --> 04:00.371
Who--who said that?

04:00.439 --> 04:03.174
I think we ought to go
. (Archie) Yeah, see you later.

04:03.241 --> 04:05.509
Well, listen, youse two, I mean,
thank you very, very much.

04:05.577 --> 04:09.313
In other words, I mean to say, what I mean
to say is, God bless the two of youse.

04:09.381 --> 04:11.382
We'll see you, arch. I'll see
you in the morning, Archie.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.517
Bye, everybody (All) Bye.

04:13.585 --> 04:17.488
Archie, do you feel up
to talkin' about it now?

04:17.555 --> 04:19.357
What do you mean, up to talkin' about it?

04:19.423 --> 04:21.860
I was just gettin' down
to talkin' about it.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.095
This happened on the last
coffee break of the day.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.965
For me, it could've been the last
coffee break of all time, Edith.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.366
I'm sittin' there

04:28.433 --> 04:31.335
when Dutch krieger ups to me and
offers me a hard boiled egg

04:31.403 --> 04:33.271
left over from his lunch, you know?

04:33.338 --> 04:35.540
So, I take them egg, you
know, I--I peel it off

04:35.607 --> 04:38.877
and I'm just about to eat
it, when all of a sudden

04:38.944 --> 04:42.480
a voice, you know, come like
out of nowhere into my head.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.415
And it says to me:

04:44.483 --> 04:46.217
"You need salt on that egg."

04:49.055 --> 04:51.056
Your voice was right.

04:51.123 --> 04:55.659
Because a hardboiled egg always
tastes better with salt on it.

04:57.396 --> 05:00.431
If you want, startin' tomorrow,
I'll put a hard boiled--

05:00.499 --> 05:03.267
would you shut up and let
me finish the story here?

05:05.037 --> 05:08.305
So, I take a couple of steps
over to Dutch to get the salt,

05:08.373 --> 05:10.274
and I here a whoosh behind me.

05:10.342 --> 05:14.345
I turn around and bam, this crate
comes right down off of a crane,

05:14.413 --> 05:16.915
down on a loadin' platform
right where I was sittin'.

05:16.982 --> 05:19.617
Now can you imagine if that thing
had hit me on top of my head?

05:19.685 --> 05:22.186
Wasn't you wearing your safety hat?

05:29.161 --> 05:31.595
The crate weighed one ton.

05:32.697 --> 05:33.898
If I hadn't have moved,

05:33.965 --> 05:36.901
my feet would've been
wearing my safety hat.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.037
Gee, arch, you sure were lucky.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.906
Aw, come on, it wasn't luck.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.808
It wasn't luck, it was God.

05:44.442 --> 05:45.943
Who?

05:46.011 --> 05:48.980
You heard me, it was God's voice

05:49.048 --> 05:51.348
that warned me and saved me there.

05:51.416 --> 05:54.285
Uh-uh, how did you know it was God's voice?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.921
Because, buddy, God has one of them voices

05:56.989 --> 05:59.290
that you never ever forget.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.794
You know, like bing Crosby.

06:05.598 --> 06:09.934
Oh, my, Archie.

06:10.002 --> 06:13.237
It's like a miracle you wasn't killed.

06:13.305 --> 06:14.939
What do you mean, like a miracle?

06:15.006 --> 06:16.875
I'm telling ya, it was a miracle.

06:16.942 --> 06:19.811
Aw, come on Archie, it was luck,
there's no such thing as miracles.

06:19.878 --> 06:22.046
Ah? What the hell do you know?

06:22.114 --> 06:24.515
There's millions and billions
of people that read the Bible.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.685
There are plenty of miracles. Miracles
run all through the Bible there.

06:27.753 --> 06:30.154
What about your story of
Noah and the whale there?

06:30.222 --> 06:31.723
What about samson?

06:31.790 --> 06:33.625
He takes a jawbone out of the grass

06:33.692 --> 06:36.193
and he kills the whole
army of the Philippines.

06:41.066 --> 06:43.367
What's important is you're alive!

06:43.435 --> 06:45.770
Yeah, all right, Edith,
all right, all right!

06:45.838 --> 06:47.338
I'm alive and I'm hungry,

06:47.405 --> 06:49.707
so, shake a leg and get supper
on the table there, will ya?

06:49.775 --> 06:51.175
Oh, I'll-- I'll help you, ma.

06:51.243 --> 06:52.510
Oh, yes, thank you.

06:52.578 --> 06:57.549
Oh, my, I'm lucky I have
you to shake a leg for.

06:59.518 --> 07:01.385
Look at this.

07:01.453 --> 07:05.189
This could be me I'm
holding in my hand here.

07:05.256 --> 07:08.526
Well, I'm tellin' you, it
makes a guy stop and think

07:08.594 --> 07:11.061
when he's just been the
victim of a miracle.

07:11.129 --> 07:12.663
Come on, you just had a close call.

07:12.731 --> 07:14.765
You don't have to pretend
to get religious about it.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.434
Hey, hey, there. I don't pretend
nothing when it comes to religion.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.303
I'll show you how much I pretend.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.371
Hey, Edith, get out here, will ya?

07:21.439 --> 07:24.375
Here, Archie, dinner's almost ready.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.944
Yeah, well, hold dinner for a minute.
Now you got the number,

07:27.012 --> 07:29.980
I want you to get on the phone and
get ahold of reverend Fletcher.

07:30.048 --> 07:31.983
Felcher. Whatever.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.785
Get him on the blower there, eh?

07:34.853 --> 07:37.121
What do you wanna talk to him for?

07:37.223 --> 07:39.057
I got a little surprise for him.

07:39.124 --> 07:41.959
And a surprise for you, too.
Hurry up there, huh?

07:42.027 --> 07:43.260
Oh, all right.

07:46.264 --> 07:47.732
Oh.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.202
This guy's been flying around
the house since July the 4th.

07:52.604 --> 07:54.271
I'll get him now.

07:54.339 --> 07:55.840
[Exclaiming]

08:04.083 --> 08:07.218
All right, hold it, hold it
. Hold it, meathead, don't move.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.521
Don't move, don't move.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.792
Yeah, I finally knocked his brains out.

08:16.094 --> 08:19.463
Arch, you killed a fly.
One of God's creatures.

08:19.531 --> 08:21.532
Aw, that's gonna make no difference.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.035
Insects and animals don't
count, they ain't got no souls.

08:25.103 --> 08:27.538
Which means they can't get into heaven?
That's right.

08:27.606 --> 08:30.441
Who'd want to go to heaven if
it was full of flies and dogs?

08:34.913 --> 08:36.914
Might as well stay in New York.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.320
Hello, reverend felcher?

08:42.386 --> 08:44.388
(Archie) Yeah, I'll be right there, Edie.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.123
You still got some fly on you, there.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.993
(Edith) Yeah, Archie wants to talk to you.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.294
Here. Yeah.

08:50.362 --> 08:52.196
Uh, hello there, reverend Fletcher.

08:52.897 --> 08:55.433
Whatever.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.768
Uh, listen, what I wanted to say was, uh,

08:57.836 --> 09:01.672
you remember the annual appeal for
the "leak in roof" envelopes?

09:01.739 --> 09:05.009
We're supposed to put some
money in and send back.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.810
I know you never got mine.

09:06.878 --> 09:08.446
That's what I'm trying to tell ya.

09:08.513 --> 09:11.415
I'm gonna put an extra buck in
the basket on Sunday for that.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.151
That's right, I am gonna do--

09:14.219 --> 09:16.153
you're gonna know it's my buck.

09:16.221 --> 09:19.857
Look for the dollar that has "a.
B." Under "in God we trust."

09:19.924 --> 09:21.359
Yeah.

09:21.426 --> 09:24.194
And I want to come to
church every Sunday now.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.332
And I promise I'm gonna do
good work for the church.

09:27.399 --> 09:29.767
Absolutely, reverend.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.202
Yeah, well, listen. We've
got to eat now, so, uh,

09:32.270 --> 09:33.671
I'll see you in church, huh?

09:33.739 --> 09:37.341
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, ok, bye.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.577
There. Oh, Archie!

09:39.645 --> 09:42.413
I'm so proud of you.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.581
Yeah, certainly you are.

09:43.649 --> 09:46.116
I'll get dinner. Get it, yeah.

09:46.184 --> 09:48.786
All right. You heard that telephone
conversation, didn't ya?

09:48.854 --> 09:50.954
I heard it, I heard it,
but I don't believe it.

09:51.023 --> 09:54.058
Because come this Sunday, you're
gonna be doing what you always do.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.593
You're gonna be sitting right
in this chair, drinking beer,

09:56.661 --> 09:59.464
watching T.V. and swearing at Joe namath.

09:59.531 --> 10:01.765
You wanna bet me $5000?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.834
Arch, did you ever stop to think

10:03.902 --> 10:05.435
when that crate dropped...

10:05.503 --> 10:07.838
Maybe God was out to get you and missed?

10:16.281 --> 10:19.050
Come and get it. Oh, boy, am I hungry!

10:19.117 --> 10:20.184
Oh!

10:20.251 --> 10:22.152
Who do you think you are?

10:22.220 --> 10:25.890
Diving after the food the way
a pelican dives after fish.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.825
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.928
Nobody eats nothin' here,
until we say grace.

10:32.498 --> 10:33.797
We never say grace.

10:33.865 --> 10:36.667
Well, we're gonna say it from now on.

10:36.735 --> 10:39.503
I always say grace in my heart.

10:39.571 --> 10:42.306
Well, in your mouth, you're
gonna say it tonight.

10:44.743 --> 10:47.711
Uh, we're gonna give God thanks
for the food on this table

10:47.779 --> 10:49.380
which comes from him.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.281
Maybe we can ask him to lower his prices.

10:52.884 --> 10:54.952
Never mind. You're blaspheming there.

10:56.321 --> 10:59.457
Just clam up, all of youse
now and bow your heads down.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.459
Bow that head down.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.032
Hello, lord, a. Bunker here.

11:10.669 --> 11:15.005
I wanna give thou thanks for the food
that thou put on the table here.

11:15.073 --> 11:17.341
For instance, the salad.

11:17.408 --> 11:18.943
The, uh, meatloaf,

11:20.112 --> 11:22.346
pearl potatoes, um,

11:22.413 --> 11:24.381
chopped up green stuff here.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.185
Broccoli.

11:27.252 --> 11:29.319
She says it's broccoli, lord,

11:33.925 --> 11:37.194
and for snatching me from the,
what do you call, "jaws of death,"

11:37.262 --> 11:41.732
I'll thank you for that in private
before I go to bed tonight. Amen.

11:41.799 --> 11:44.468
Oh, Archie, that was beautiful.

11:44.536 --> 11:45.736
Damn right it was.

11:49.474 --> 11:51.274
All right, can we eat now?

11:51.376 --> 11:52.709
Hold it, hold it.

11:53.512 --> 11:54.845
Give me that.

11:57.248 --> 11:58.482
Now.

12:01.019 --> 12:03.321
[Cutlery clattering]

12:27.880 --> 12:29.714
Hey, daddy.

12:29.781 --> 12:32.550
Did you ever think that crate just
missing you was probably pure luck?

12:32.617 --> 12:37.021
Aw, luck, luck, luck. Who do you
think is the boss over all luck?

12:37.122 --> 12:39.156
God. That's right.

12:39.224 --> 12:41.825
It was good luck. Anything
bad comes from the devil.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.495
Arch, there is no devil,
there is no heaven,

12:44.563 --> 12:46.530
there is no hell, and there is no God.

12:46.598 --> 12:48.232
Oh, there he goes again, lord!

12:48.300 --> 12:49.533
[All clamoring]

12:49.601 --> 12:51.669
That's right, arch, I'll
tell you something else--

12:51.671 --> 12:53.404
[choking] Lord, listen to this.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.572
Hey, hey, hey. Michael, what's the matter?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.908
Food went down the wrong way.

12:57.976 --> 13:00.677
Oh, no! What the lord servin' them
words back down your throat again.

13:00.745 --> 13:02.479
[Shouting]

13:03.382 --> 13:06.417
Raise your arms over your head.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.018
[Choking]

13:08.086 --> 13:09.620
Shut up. Go on.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.922
That'll show you to fool around
with the lord, you wise guy.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.557
Honey, sit down.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.026
[Scoffing] Put your head between your legs!

13:16.094 --> 13:18.228
Stick his head out the front door.

13:19.264 --> 13:21.031
Get after him, lord

13:21.099 --> 13:25.335
go ahead, ha-ha, do your
stuff, lord, do your stuff!

13:30.976 --> 13:33.577
[Footsteps approaching]

13:33.645 --> 13:35.179
Oh, hi, honey.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.014
Hi. Breakfast ready yet?

13:37.082 --> 13:39.717
Oh, we'll have ours after ma
and daddy go to church, ok?

13:39.784 --> 13:42.653
Gee. I gotta admit, I never
thought he'd last this long.

13:42.721 --> 13:46.991
3 Sundays in a row, that guy
must be bucking for sainthood.

13:47.058 --> 13:49.794
Yeah, ma says, he says his
prayers every night at bedtime

13:49.861 --> 13:51.628
and he's still saying grace at every meal.

13:51.696 --> 13:55.499
Yeah, but have you noticed the graces
are getting shorter and shorter?

13:55.566 --> 13:58.802
Last night's grace was just
enough to cover the soup.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.439
Hurry, you don't wanna miss the first hymn.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.742
I'll whistle the first hymn for you
on the way over to the church.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.845
Now remember, when the services
are over, I don't want you

14:07.913 --> 14:10.448
wastin' time yappin' with
that reverend Fletcher.

14:10.515 --> 14:13.350
Felcher. Whatever.

14:13.418 --> 14:16.687
I wanna race right home and tune in
on the football game here on T.V.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.389
Have you got your dollar
for the collection plate?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.659
I got it right over here in my wallet.

14:21.726 --> 14:24.862
Jeez, a dollar a week, in
that plate from now on.

14:26.064 --> 14:29.733
That comes to what, nearly $50 a year.

14:29.801 --> 14:31.569
Well, Archie, you said yourself

14:31.636 --> 14:35.439
you was payin' back the
lord for savin' your life.

14:35.473 --> 14:37.041
10 cents would've covered that.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.346
Have you got the raffle ticket?

14:42.414 --> 14:43.947
Yeah, I got it right here.

14:44.015 --> 14:45.683
They're gonna announce the winner today.

14:45.751 --> 14:49.052
This little item is gonna get the
family a brand new color T.V. set.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.788
Oh, did that little voice tell you that?

14:51.856 --> 14:53.257
That's right, meathead.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.759
The little voice told me to get
this ticket 'cause it's number 18

14:55.827 --> 14:57.194
which is my lucky number.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.630
Oh, you believe in lucky numbers too, huh?

14:59.698 --> 15:02.666
When it's based on cold hard facts, yeah.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.703
For instance, the lord saved
me on the 18th of the month.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.105
I was born on the 18th of the month.

15:08.173 --> 15:11.175
Used to have a locker years
ago with work: Number 18.

15:11.242 --> 15:14.511
And when you first met me, I was 18.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.654
Well, not every system is perfect, Edith.

15:26.558 --> 15:27.558
Bye.

15:27.626 --> 15:28.626
(Gloria) Bye.

15:28.693 --> 15:29.693
(Mike) So long.

15:32.530 --> 15:33.764
I don't know, I don't know,

15:33.832 --> 15:36.333
I tried fixing that toilet
again, I can't do it.

15:36.401 --> 15:38.101
Maybe we'll just have to get another one.

15:38.169 --> 15:39.302
Yeah.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.238
2 heads are better than one.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.907
[Giggling]

15:43.975 --> 15:48.079
[Laughing]

15:48.146 --> 15:50.648
Yoo-hoo! We're home.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.149
(Gloria) Hi, ma.

15:52.216 --> 15:54.151
Hi, daddy, how was the sermon?

15:54.218 --> 15:56.854
Ah, that guy never stops talkin'.

15:56.922 --> 16:00.123
He don't give sermons, he
gives a weekly filibooster.

16:00.191 --> 16:04.428
And you, don't you never poke me
in the ribs in church no more.

16:04.496 --> 16:07.130
But, Archie, you were sound asleep.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.034
The whole conjugation was asleep.

16:13.204 --> 16:14.471
Picture puzzle.

16:14.539 --> 16:17.407
What man in this room did
not win a color T.V. today?

16:17.675 --> 16:19.610
Archie didn't.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.579
Mike, how did you know?

16:22.581 --> 16:23.647
Oh, who won it?

16:23.715 --> 16:26.750
Oh, some woman from Trenton, New Jersey.

16:26.818 --> 16:28.752
And she don't even go to our church.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.622
Do I run down to Trenton to
win prizes from them people?

16:33.791 --> 16:37.661
My 2 poor knees are wore out from
kneelin' down and prayin' for that thing.

16:37.729 --> 16:40.797
Uh, what's the matter, arch,
you losing your faith in God?

16:40.865 --> 16:43.400
No, did you fix the ball in the toilet yet?

16:43.468 --> 16:44.568
I was working on it, all right?

16:44.636 --> 16:46.404
Give me a hand upstairs will you, Gloria?

16:46.471 --> 16:48.105
Well, you fix it this time, will ya?

16:48.173 --> 16:52.043
Fighting that copper ball takes all
the fun out of goin' to the toilet.

16:56.414 --> 16:57.614
[Phone ringing]

16:57.682 --> 16:59.083
I'll get it.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.717
(Archie) Get the phone, Edith.

17:01.652 --> 17:02.719
Hello.

17:02.787 --> 17:05.422
Oh, hello, reverend felcher.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.457
Yeah, he is.

17:09.493 --> 17:12.362
I don't know, I'll ask him.

17:12.430 --> 17:13.463
Ask me what?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.365
Hold on, just a minute.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.969
The reverend felcher wants
you to drive the church bus

17:19.037 --> 17:21.338
on Sunday afternoon.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.006
What church bus?

17:23.074 --> 17:27.778
Well, they got a bus now to drive
around the senior circle society.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.346
Oh, jeez.

17:29.414 --> 17:32.749
[Exclaiming] He said it would
be like driving for the lord.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.551
Doesn't that sound nice?

17:37.722 --> 17:39.089
Give me the phone.

17:39.157 --> 17:40.357
Well, it's over there.

17:40.425 --> 17:41.892
Get out of the way.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.895
Archie, be nice.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.231
Shush, you.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.600
Hey, before you say anything, reverend,
my Sundays are all jammed up.

17:51.469 --> 17:52.836
Huh?

17:52.903 --> 17:55.139
Well, I--I know I prom--

17:55.206 --> 17:57.474
yeah, I know I promised.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.343
[Stuttering] Yeah, I know I promised--

17:59.410 --> 18:01.712
why the hell did you answer this phone?

18:03.748 --> 18:05.182
Yeah.

18:05.249 --> 18:09.386
Yeah, ok, well, yeah, I'm gonna
keep the promise, sure. What time?

18:09.454 --> 18:12.456
2:00. Yeah, I'll be there.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.558
No, I won't forget.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.595
No, I'll remember, because
2:00 is kick-off time.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.764
God bless you, too.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.768
Damn, damn, and damn!

18:24.836 --> 18:26.103
Archie.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.606
Please don't swear on Sunday.

18:29.674 --> 18:32.776
I will swear on any Sunday
when that Sunday is ruined.

18:32.844 --> 18:34.512
And this Sunday is ruined.

18:34.579 --> 18:39.316
I gotta spend it bussing a lot
of old has-beens and holdovers.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.085
I gotta take 'em to that
supper service tonight

18:42.154 --> 18:45.188
then I gotta wait around with the
bus and bus 'em all home again.

18:45.256 --> 18:47.524
You'll get a free church dinner.

18:47.592 --> 18:50.260
[Doorbell ringing] Oh, jeez, big
deal, a free church dinner.

18:50.328 --> 18:52.963
I could get one of them
at the salivation army.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.766
Hi, arch. Hiya, stretch.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.367
Oh, hi there, Edith. (Edith) Hi.

18:57.435 --> 18:59.269
Hey, arch, have I got
somethin' for the 2 of us.

18:59.337 --> 19:02.272
Huh? 2 tickets to the jets game for today.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.974
What?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.009
Look at that. Right on the 50 yard line,

19:06.077 --> 19:07.744
close enough to hear the bones break.

19:07.812 --> 19:09.746
[Laughing]

19:09.814 --> 19:12.883
Edith, they're tickets
to the jets game today.

19:12.951 --> 19:16.887
Uh, Archie can't go, stretch, 'cause
he promised the reverend felcher

19:16.955 --> 19:19.823
he'd drive for the lord today.

19:19.891 --> 19:22.359
I gotta drive for the lord today.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.628
Uh, what are you driving, arch, a hearse?

19:27.398 --> 19:29.833
Yeah, but the people are all sittin' up.

19:31.903 --> 19:34.404
Well, it's, uh, too bad
you can't go to the game.

19:34.472 --> 19:35.739
But like it says in the Bible,

19:35.807 --> 19:38.241
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away.

19:38.309 --> 19:40.243
Oh, jeez.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.544
Tough lucketh.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.682
(Gloria) Daddy,

19:44.749 --> 19:46.449
Michael needs your help upstairs.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.185
Everybody needs my help today.

19:48.252 --> 19:51.021
When is someone goin' to give me some help?

19:51.089 --> 19:53.423
Boy, is he gettin' crabby.

19:53.491 --> 19:57.628
Oh, no, Gloria, he's so disappointed.

19:57.695 --> 20:00.831
He can't go to the jets
game with stretch today

20:00.898 --> 20:04.735
'cause he was called to
drive the church bus.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.471
Called? You mean he heard a voice again?

20:07.539 --> 20:09.940
[Chuckling] Oh, no.

20:10.007 --> 20:14.378
Well, yeah, the reverend
felcher's voice on the phone.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.579
[Crashing]

20:15.647 --> 20:17.348
[Archie screaming] Oh. Oh!

20:17.415 --> 20:18.849
Archie, what is the matter?

20:18.917 --> 20:20.083
Daddy! What happened?

20:20.151 --> 20:22.085
Daddy? (Mike) I'm sorry, arch.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.521
(Archie) Get away from
me, you meathead, you.

20:24.589 --> 20:26.690
What? I was just trying to help you.
Get away.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.358
I'm sorry. Away.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.994
Every time he comes near me,
something happens here.

20:31.062 --> 20:32.629
What happened?

20:32.697 --> 20:36.332
This dumbbell dropped the
heavy lid of the toilet tank

20:36.400 --> 20:38.969
right on my instoop, here.

20:39.037 --> 20:42.072
Here, let me give you a hand, arch.
Get away from me, you.

20:42.139 --> 20:43.406
Well, let me look at it. Oh.

20:43.474 --> 20:45.275
Look, what--what are you gonna look?

20:45.342 --> 20:46.643
How're you gonna see pain?

20:48.813 --> 20:50.681
Archie,

20:50.748 --> 20:54.017
do you think you'll still be
able to drive the church bus?

21:03.861 --> 21:06.396
Oh, jeez, I wouldn't think so, Edith.

21:06.464 --> 21:10.467
I mean, it's the right foot. How can I drive, dear?
I can hardly stand up.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.969
Well, let me sit down. The
pain's getting worse here.

21:13.037 --> 21:14.705
[Moaning] Gee.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.741
I tell you what, you better
call up the reverend Fletcher.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.377
Felcher. Whatever.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.479
And tell him to get somebody else to drive

21:22.547 --> 21:26.082
'cause I wouldn't wanna disappoint
all them nice old folks.

21:26.150 --> 21:27.718
All right. Right away.

21:27.785 --> 21:29.252
We better elevate that foot.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.121
Michael, pull over the coffee table.
Get a pillow for it.

21:32.189 --> 21:34.458
Will that help me, little girl?
I think it'll help, daddy.

21:34.525 --> 21:36.860
Yeah, you're a good girl. I know.

21:36.927 --> 21:40.730
Arch, let me take your shoe
off-- get away from there!

21:40.799 --> 21:43.566
That shoe might be the only thing
holdin' the foot together.

21:45.669 --> 21:49.072
Daddy, if the foot's that bad, maybe
we should be calling the doctor.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.974
Never mind the doctor,
get a plumber, will ya?

21:51.042 --> 21:54.044
That toilet's out to kill me.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.881
Oh, thank you very much, yeah. Oh, goodbye.

21:57.949 --> 22:01.819
Reverend felcher says he'll get
somebody to drive the bus.

22:01.886 --> 22:04.588
And he said he'd say a prayer for you.

22:04.655 --> 22:07.691
I hope he keeps it short,
he'll put the lord to sleep.

22:07.759 --> 22:08.992
(Gloria) Daddy, does it hurt?

22:09.060 --> 22:10.327
[Doorbell ringing] I got pain here.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.863
(Edith) I'll get it
. I'll get you an ice bag.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.130
Thank you, sweetheart.

22:14.198 --> 22:16.433
Oh, hi, Irene. Come in. Hi.

22:16.501 --> 22:20.136
I just came over to see if I could
borrow Archie's binoculars.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.238
Of course. Ah! The pain here.

22:23.407 --> 22:25.041
What's the matter with your foot?

22:25.109 --> 22:26.876
God's aim is gettin' better.

22:30.014 --> 22:31.849
Here you go, Irene.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.483
Oh, thank you, Edith.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.386
Hey, what do you want the
binoculars for there, Irene?

22:35.453 --> 22:38.689
Don't tell me Barney Hefner is
leavin' his shades up again.

22:38.756 --> 22:41.591
No, stretch wants them for the game today.

22:41.692 --> 22:44.127
Wait a minute. Ain't stretch
left for the game yet?

22:44.194 --> 22:47.130
Oh, he's over at my house havin'
milk and cookies. Hold everything,

22:47.198 --> 22:50.333
maybe I'm in luck. Maybe I can
catch him before he goes.

22:50.401 --> 22:53.170
Archie! Look, you're walkin' good again.

22:53.237 --> 22:55.605
Hey, I was sittin' in the chair
there, prayin' for relief

22:55.673 --> 22:57.941
and guess what happened? I got relief.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.082
Another miracle. Praise the lord!

23:06.284 --> 23:08.352
Shut up, you.

23:08.419 --> 23:11.788
Daddy, I got the ice bag. What
are you doin' on your bad foot?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.891
I know I shouldn't be, but I can't
let stretch go to a ball game alone.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.827
Oh, he's not going alone.

23:16.894 --> 23:18.061
Huh?

23:18.128 --> 23:20.864
He said you couldn't make
it and then he told me:

23:20.932 --> 23:24.902
"Arch can't go, so I'm taking one
of the other guys from work."

23:24.969 --> 23:27.003
Don't tell me that, Irene.

23:27.071 --> 23:28.337
Who's he takin'?

23:28.405 --> 23:29.405
Me.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.909
[Laughing]

23:35.913 --> 23:37.514
[Mimicking Irene]

23:39.017 --> 23:40.017
Oh!

23:45.389 --> 23:47.958
Why do these things happen to me?

23:49.194 --> 23:51.728
The lord works in mysterious ways, Archie.
