That's top notch songs!

We're going to our hometown.
We're not tourists.

00:36.227 --> 00:38.261
Well, we're essentially
tourists at this point.

00:40.297 --> 00:41.765
Hey, how sick do you think Dad will be?

00:41.866 --> 00:43.767
Do you think we'll be able to
talk to him or do you think

00:43.868 --> 00:46.269
- he'll be like... a husk?
- I guarantee you Dad is fine.

00:46.371 --> 00:49.272
- He's probably just doing it for attention.
- Oh, don't say that.

00:49.374 --> 00:52.776
- Dad's OK. He's a good guy.
- Dad is a good...?

00:52.877 --> 00:54.945
- He's OK.
- He's not OK!

00:55.046 --> 00:56.947
Dad is not a good guy. He abandoned us

00:57.048 --> 00:58.949
- when we were kids, Mark.
- Come on...

00:59.050 --> 01:00.884
Like, when I was a kid.
You were like twenty.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.220
I was not like twenty.

01:03.321 --> 01:05.956
- How old were you?
- I was eight!

01:06.057 --> 01:07.891
What do you think our age difference is?

01:07.992 --> 01:09.893
Honestly, I've never known.
And you are blowing

01:09.994 --> 01:11.928
my mind right now. It's only four years

01:12.030 --> 01:13.897
- between us?
- Yes!

01:13.998 --> 01:16.099
Cause in my memory, back then,
you were already balding.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.735
- I was not balding at eight!
- You were a balding boy.

01:18.836 --> 01:20.804
No, I wasn't! I've always had
a high forehead. I wasn't bald!

01:20.905 --> 01:22.906
Man, I swear to you.
There was a period of my life

01:23.007 --> 01:24.841
when I thought you were
so much older than me

01:24.942 --> 01:26.843
I didn't think I had a brother.
I thought you were Dad's friend.

01:26.944 --> 01:29.579
- Oh, come on. Come on!
- I'm serious! I'm serious!

01:29.681 --> 01:31.581
- You're not serious.
- There was a kid at daycare

01:31.683 --> 01:33.583
who asked if I had any siblings
and I was like: It's just me,

01:33.685 --> 01:36.920
my mom, my dad and my dad's friend Andy, who
sleeps in the same room as me for some reason.

01:37.021 --> 01:39.923
- Seems self-conscious about his thinning hair.
- Alright. Just, please...

01:40.024 --> 01:42.192
Shut up. Just...
We're driving and we're not talking.

01:42.293 --> 01:44.261
- We're done, OK?
- Alright.

01:44.362 --> 01:46.263

- No! No!

And here we are.

02:11.563 --> 02:13.390
Yeah!

02:13.491 --> 02:16.893
Ha! Ha! Ha! Wow!

02:17.953 --> 02:19.262
Look at this place!

02:20.246 --> 02:22.466
Oh! I forgot about the UFO!

02:22.567 --> 02:25.235
- I didn't.
- Oh!

02:25.336 --> 02:29.406
- My gosh! Is that little Mark?
- Hi!

02:29.507 --> 02:31.541
Yes. Sorry, who are you?

02:31.642 --> 02:33.744
I'm Ruth! I'm your father's...

02:33.845 --> 02:36.246
- Well, I guess you'd say partner.
- Dad's got a partner.

02:36.347 --> 02:38.548
- Cool.
- I remember you

02:38.649 --> 02:40.317
from when you were a little boy.
You haven't changed a bit!

02:40.418 --> 02:42.419
- Thank you, Ruth.
- And who's your friend?

02:42.520 --> 02:45.188
Hi, Ruth. It's Andy.

02:45.289 --> 02:47.691
- Andrew.
- He's slightly less memorable.

02:49.161 --> 02:51.025
I used... I lived here for eight years.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.262
We used to come into
your hardware store.

02:52.363 --> 02:54.397
Were you sort of balding back then too?

02:54.499 --> 02:56.433
- That's him. Yeah.
- No. No. I wasn't.

02:56.534 --> 02:59.096
- I was eight. That's not a thing.
- That's who you're thinking of.

02:59.131 --> 03:00.237
Let me help you with your things.

03:00.338 --> 03:03.540
- Oh, sure!
- You don't have to. Or... OK.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.810
- I like this place already.
- Um. It's great.

03:09.313 --> 03:11.581
- Here it is!
- Wow!

03:11.682 --> 03:14.310
I'm not sure how much of
this stuff you will remember.

03:14.345 --> 03:16.813
Oh, man! Look at all this cool crap!

03:16.848 --> 03:18.355
Wow!

03:18.456 --> 03:22.225
Aww... Sarcophagus.
Andy, we've got a sarcophagus.

03:22.326 --> 03:25.128
Wow, Andy, check this stuff out, man!

03:25.229 --> 03:27.697
We've got a stuffed baby deer.
That's horrifying.

03:27.799 --> 03:29.900
Oh, we got a fetus in a jar, Andy!

03:30.001 --> 03:32.569
- Please don't be real.
- Your father dealt with a lot

03:32.670 --> 03:34.604
- of shady people over the years.
- Yeah.

03:34.705 --> 03:37.474
And we used to help him.
He used to call me "the bait".

03:37.575 --> 03:39.576
Oh, you're the bait!

03:39.677 --> 03:42.445
Well, now, I remember you!

03:42.547 --> 03:45.248
- Yeah, I remember when you were the bait.
- So, where is Dad?

03:45.349 --> 03:47.250
Out back yelling at a
school group or something?

03:47.351 --> 03:49.619
He's actually in bed now.
He's been spending

03:49.720 --> 03:52.756
- a lot of time there.
- Oh, really? Is he like a...

03:52.857 --> 03:55.659
- Is he like a husk?
- No, no quite. No.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.594
The doctor says that he'll be fine.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.596
He just has to take it easy.
But of course,

03:59.697 --> 04:02.299
that doesn't come naturally to him,
as you know.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.402
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- We don't. We don't know him.

04:05.503 --> 04:08.338
- Well, you'll see him tonight at dinner.
- Cool, cool.

04:08.439 --> 04:10.373
I know what's new.
You probably haven't seen

04:10.474 --> 04:14.244
- the wrestling bear.
- My goodness! Andy, come on!

04:14.345 --> 04:16.346
Let's go and take a look at that guy!

04:16.447 --> 04:18.882
- What a big boy!
- Hello.

04:18.983 --> 04:21.317
- Woah, woah, woah!
- Oh! My gosh! Oh, well. OK.

04:22.132 --> 04:25.222
This is my niece Bryn.
She helps us out at the museum.

04:25.323 --> 04:27.190
Hey, Bryn. You kind of scared us
there for a second.

04:27.874 --> 04:30.660
- Yeah.
- Oh! Maybe Bryn could

04:30.761 --> 04:33.597
show you around town tomorrow
when the stores are open again.

04:33.698 --> 04:36.399
Yeah. Sure, that sounds good.
Why are the stores

04:36.500 --> 04:39.202
- closed today, by the way?
- It's Beast Day.

04:40.304 --> 04:42.239
- OK. Cool.
- Yeah...

04:42.340 --> 04:44.241
- Beast Day.
- What is Beast Day?

04:44.342 --> 04:47.744
Oh, well... Once a year,
a beast emerges from the forest

04:47.845 --> 04:49.746
and searches for someone to consume,

04:49.847 --> 04:51.915
so everybody closes their
stores and stays at home

04:52.016 --> 04:54.251
just to wait things out.
I'm gonna take you to your room.

04:54.352 --> 04:56.887
- Uh, actually.
- Stop you right there.

04:56.988 --> 04:59.089
Yeah. Could you maybe repeat
what you just said? Yeah.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.157
Rewind that and sort
of run it back for us.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.860
Oh! Every small town

05:03.961 --> 05:07.564
- has its superstitions.
- Oh, so it's a superstition.

05:07.665 --> 05:10.367
Maybe that's the wrong word.
What do you call something

05:10.468 --> 05:13.303
that everyone believes in
because it's real?

05:14.267 --> 05:16.373
- A fact.
- A fact! That's it,

05:16.474 --> 05:19.022
that's what we have.
And as a matter of fact,

05:19.057 --> 05:22.712
- Bryn did a drawing of the beast.
- Oh, it's just a quick sketch

05:22.813 --> 05:25.882
based off the detailed account
of the town's residents.

05:27.624 --> 05:28.885
OK!

05:28.986 --> 05:30.887
Yeah, that is very detailed, Bryn.

05:30.988 --> 05:33.890
Like... anatomically detailed.

05:33.991 --> 05:36.660
A lot going on south of the
border on the old beast.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.496
Yeah. OK, I'll give that
back to you there.

05:39.597 --> 05:42.399
- I can sketch you sometime if you want.
- I'm gonna say no to that,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.534
but thank you so much for offering.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.404
- OK. So just let me know whenever is good.
- Not... We don't want to.

05:47.505 --> 05:49.906
I think we're gonna go
check out our old room now,

05:50.007 --> 05:52.008
- if that's cool.
- Yes! Yes.

05:52.109 --> 05:54.244
Well, it's exactly how you left it.

05:55.665 --> 05:57.691
Oh, wow!

05:58.592 --> 06:00.650
This place looks exactly the same!

06:00.751 --> 06:03.720
Look, all my trophies and
medals and all your...

06:03.821 --> 06:05.855
shelf space where trophies and medals

06:05.957 --> 06:09.592
theoretically could've gone.
Oh, Big Bear!

06:11.179 --> 06:12.095
Remember Big Bear, Andy?

06:12.196 --> 06:15.198
- Yeah.
- Man, I can't believe Dad held on to all of our stuff.

06:15.299 --> 06:17.200
- I hope he's OK.
- Dad is fine.

06:17.301 --> 06:19.803
- Probably in bed watching TV.
- Oh, you cynic.

06:21.219 --> 06:23.106
- Ah! Look at that.
- Who's that?

06:24.127 --> 06:25.208
It's Molly Field.

06:26.088 --> 06:27.811
It's this girl I used
to have a crush on.

06:27.912 --> 06:30.447
Oh! Like, when you were
the same age as her or...?

06:31.487 --> 06:33.483
- Yes.
- OK. Yeah, no, just checking.

06:34.492 --> 06:37.278
Oh, hey, look at that!
You did win some stuff.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.621
What is that, a sixth place ribbon?

06:38.723 --> 06:42.559
And... birthday boy. Birthday boy!

06:42.660 --> 06:45.895
- Someone rewarded you for having a birthday.
- Yeah.

06:45.997 --> 06:49.966
- Buddy, it is good to be home!
- Yeah.

06:51.086 --> 06:53.870
OK! I've set out the scraps of meat

06:53.971 --> 06:56.239
and the milk as an
offering to the beast,

06:56.340 --> 06:59.393
so I think we're all set.
Rollie should be down any minute.

06:59.829 --> 07:01.845
Oh! Here he comes!

07:05.549 --> 07:06.856
Dad?

07:09.420 --> 07:11.688
You OK, Dad? You need help or something?

07:11.789 --> 07:13.243
Are you alright? You OK, Dad?

07:16.490 --> 07:18.161
Oh! No!

07:22.116 --> 07:24.034
Surprise!

07:24.135 --> 07:26.569
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh... My gosh! - Look at them!

07:27.183 --> 07:28.705
That was a prank?

07:28.806 --> 07:32.490
Well, I had to make some kind
of an entrance, didn't I?

07:32.989 --> 07:34.044
Tada!

07:34.145 --> 07:36.179
That was a hell of a prank, Dad!

07:36.280 --> 07:38.341
You are bad!

07:38.449 --> 07:41.017
Come here, Daddy!

07:41.118 --> 07:43.887
Mark! Look at you, little guy.
You've grown!

07:43.988 --> 07:46.222
- Well, I'm thirty now.
- You're 30 years old?

07:46.323 --> 07:48.658
- Yeah.
- Good boy! Andy!

07:48.759 --> 07:52.529
- How's the stick?
- What stick?

07:52.630 --> 07:54.643
The one up your ass.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.134
- Oh!
- My goodness, Rollie!

08:00.400 --> 08:01.838
You walked into that one, pal.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.840
- Oh, it's great to be home!
- I suppose

08:03.941 --> 08:06.109
we should get started. Bryn, sweetie,

08:06.210 --> 08:08.078
would you like to say the beast prayer?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.081
The beast prayer?

08:11.182 --> 08:14.751
- Oh. OK.
- Great. Whenever you're ready.

08:14.852 --> 08:17.219
Dear Lord, please keep us safe
from the beast this night.

08:17.254 --> 08:19.667
The awful beast, with its face of wolf,
its body of wolf,

08:19.702 --> 08:21.591
and horrifying fangs not
unlike those of a wolf.

08:21.692 --> 08:24.160
Many would be tempted
to believe it is a wolf.

08:24.261 --> 08:26.196
However, we know it is the beast,

08:26.297 --> 08:28.698
bigger than a wolf, probably.
We're pretty sure it has more limbs.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.866
So please keep us safe, O Lord. Amen.

08:29.967 --> 08:33.736
- Amen.
- Cool prayer, Bryn. Thanks.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.705
Did we have Beast Day
when I was a kid, Dad?

08:35.806 --> 08:37.874
- I don't really remember that.
- Well, our family

08:37.975 --> 08:40.043
didn't really celebrate it that much.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.178
Ruth's more into that kind of things.

08:42.279 --> 08:45.248
I figure if there is a beast,
we should cover out basis.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.717
But also, I think it's a nice excuse

08:47.818 --> 08:50.353
to spend time with family.
Oh, please start.

08:50.454 --> 08:53.389
- Enjoy the ham.
- So, Dad... How are you feeling?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.859
You look a lot livelier that I expected.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.927
Oh, well, sorry to disappoint you, Andy.

09:00.048 --> 09:03.399
Actually, I have had a couple
of little heart attacks.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.835
But I'm not quite on my death bed,

09:05.936 --> 09:07.971
if that's what you were expecting.
Cheers!

09:08.072 --> 09:10.173
Well, you kind of
led us to believe that.

09:10.274 --> 09:12.609
- That's why we're here.
- Oh!

09:12.710 --> 09:14.677
Well, it's funny.
I thought you were here

09:14.778 --> 09:17.213
cause you wanted to spend some
quality time with your dad!

09:17.955 --> 09:19.349
That's funny, Dad. And it's funny

09:19.450 --> 09:22.352
what you said also, Andy.
This meal is so good, Ruth.

09:22.453 --> 09:24.621
Yeah, the ham and whatnot. Terrific.

09:24.722 --> 09:26.990
I'm sorry.
Are you accusing us of not wanting

09:27.091 --> 09:28.892
to spend time with you?
Because last time I checked

09:28.993 --> 09:30.894
you abandoned us when we were kids.

09:30.995 --> 09:35.298
Ah... Here we go! What did I say?

09:36.140 --> 09:40.087
Let's get the facts right, Andy.
I did not abandon you.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.473
Your mother took you to Toronto.

09:43.574 --> 09:46.376
All I did was pretend you were dead

09:46.477 --> 09:48.645
and ignore you for 26 years.

09:48.746 --> 09:51.214
That's worse! That is so much worse!

09:51.315 --> 09:53.716
Maybe we'll just agree
to disagree and uh...

09:53.817 --> 09:55.852
concentrate on this delicious ham.

09:55.953 --> 09:58.888
- What do you actually want me to say, Andrew?
- I don't know!

09:58.989 --> 10:01.524
Uh, how about "I'm sorry"
and then let's go from there?

10:01.625 --> 10:03.560
Alright! Fair enough!
I'm sorry. I am sorry

10:03.661 --> 10:05.962
that you've got such a
massive stick up your ass.

10:07.604 --> 10:08.728
That's great.

10:08.763 --> 10:10.400
Good ham. Great, great ham.

10:10.501 --> 10:12.468
I have no idea why I came back here.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.904
- Well, why don't you leave?
- You know what? I'm going to.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.507
I'm gonna leave! I am going to
leave tomorrow and I'm gone.

10:17.608 --> 10:19.709
Alright, then! Right. That's fine by me!

10:19.810 --> 10:21.744
I can go back to pretending you're dead,

10:21.845 --> 10:23.780
- can I?
- Dad, don't...

10:23.881 --> 10:25.915
Alright, well. Um...

10:26.016 --> 10:28.751
I'll put your dinner in
the fridge for later!

10:33.268 --> 10:34.924
You know, I think
we're gonna look back on this

10:35.025 --> 10:36.960
as a productive conversation.

10:37.061 --> 10:41.064
- Yeah. Maybe, yeah.
- It really is great ham.

10:41.165 --> 10:43.933
It is good ham.
Thank you, Bryn, for saying that.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.002
I was waiting for
someone to corroborate.

10:47.854 --> 10:49.439
You want to talk about it?

10:49.540 --> 10:53.409
- No.
- OK.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:06.991 --> 11:09.592
- Oh! Oh, I had a nightmare.
- What?

11:09.693 --> 11:12.996
Boys! Your father is missing!

11:13.097 --> 11:16.899
- Was it the...?
- Yes. It was the beast.

11:19.003 --> 11:20.903
Or possibly something else,

11:21.005 --> 11:24.007
but... I'm pretty sure it was the beast.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.490
What do you think, constable Gibbs?

11:39.418 --> 11:41.227
It's kind of hard to tell.

11:41.328 --> 11:44.997
There's no sign of forced entry,
no body...

11:45.098 --> 11:47.066
and no hard evidence
linking this to the beast.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.402
Thank you!
He probably just went for a walk

11:49.503 --> 11:51.404
and booked himself into
a motel or something.

11:51.505 --> 11:53.572
He wasn't going for a walk!
He was attacked in the yard!

11:53.674 --> 11:55.908
- We found his robe.
- So?

11:56.009 --> 11:59.111
So, there's blood on it. See?
Blood. Blood. Constable Gibbs...

11:59.212 --> 12:02.948
- Blood on the robe. You see that?
- Hmm. This is interesting.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.351
Come on! If he was attacked by a beast,

12:05.452 --> 12:08.847
don't you think there'd be more blood?
And wouldn't it be torn a bit?

12:08.882 --> 12:10.923
- Yeah, that's a good point.
- Or...

12:11.024 --> 12:14.960
Countertheory.
The beast knows how to undress people.

12:15.545 --> 12:16.896
- That is interesting.
- Bryn!

12:16.997 --> 12:19.265
Did you see anything like
that in your dream, Mark?

12:19.366 --> 12:21.033
To be honest, the details
of my dream are pretty hazy,

12:21.134 --> 12:23.736
- so I'm not sure.
- Woah. You had the beast dream?

12:23.837 --> 12:25.938
- I guess I did, yeah.
- The beast dream?

12:26.039 --> 12:28.641
- Oh, this changes everything.
- No! It doesn't change a thing.

12:28.742 --> 12:30.876
I mean, Mark heard a bunch of
stuff about a beast yesterday,

12:30.977 --> 12:32.945
then he had a dream.
That's how dreams work.

12:33.046 --> 12:35.881
- Shut your mouth.
- What did the beast look like

12:35.982 --> 12:37.983
- in your dream?
- Well, unfortunately,

12:38.085 --> 12:39.952
the whole dream was
from the beast's P.O.V,

12:40.053 --> 12:42.288
- so I never got to look at him.
- Damn it! Damn it!

12:42.389 --> 12:45.324
It would have been nice if the beast
had walked passed a mirror or something.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.657
- I was thinking the same thing.
- That would've been good.

12:47.728 --> 12:51.004
Can we please stop talking
about Mark's dream and find Dad?

12:51.005 --> 12:52.607
You know, that's a good call.

12:52.642 --> 12:55.234
It's time to get down to business.

12:57.363 --> 12:58.671
Can I have your attention please?

12:59.147 --> 13:00.673
I'd like to welcome our mayor,

13:00.774 --> 13:02.762
Helen Breeley.

13:05.996 --> 13:10.416
Hello, citizens of Cavendish! How are
the best damn people in the world?

13:12.330 --> 13:13.352
Wouh!

13:13.453 --> 13:15.855
- Doing very well, thank you.
- Alright, good stuff.

13:15.956 --> 13:18.023
Good to hear. Unfortunately,

13:18.125 --> 13:21.360
a time many of us have feared
since childhood is upon us.

13:22.297 --> 13:25.030
The beast has returned to our fair town

13:25.132 --> 13:30.035
and taken one of our own. Last night,
Rollie Tennesen disappeared.

13:30.137 --> 13:32.505
One of his sons saw
it happen in a dream.

13:33.492 --> 13:36.575
Yeah. Beast dream. Brutal.

13:36.676 --> 13:40.880
Now, none of us were alive the last time
the beast took a townsperson,

13:40.981 --> 13:43.048
but we've all heard the stories.

13:43.150 --> 13:48.154
They are woven into the very fabric
of our municipal flag.

13:48.255 --> 13:50.890
The question is:
Now that the beast has returned,

13:51.688 --> 13:53.139
what should we do?

13:53.960 --> 13:55.828
- Yes?
- Uh...

13:55.929 --> 13:59.231
...is what it is... you don't go to...

14:00.032 --> 14:01.500
...used to say he's a street angel...

14:02.423 --> 14:03.535
...the house devil.

14:05.472 --> 14:07.506
...I say all you got to
do is give him a wicked...

14:08.487 --> 14:10.676
...you're golden.

14:10.777 --> 14:12.678
I appreciate your honesty, Felix.
Thank you.

14:12.779 --> 14:15.648
Mayor Breeley!
I'd like to say something.

14:15.749 --> 14:18.017
- What's that, Molly?
- That's Molly Field!

14:18.118 --> 14:20.186
- Huh?
- From the grade 3 photo.

14:20.287 --> 14:22.188
Oh! You should talk to her. After this.

14:22.289 --> 14:24.356
- After this.
- You all know me.

14:24.457 --> 14:27.226
- You know how I earn a living.
- Oh, yeah.

14:27.327 --> 14:29.695
- You work here at the dinner.
- That's right.

14:29.796 --> 14:33.098
But you also know how
I supplement my income.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.568
- I want to say hunting.
- Hunting!

14:35.669 --> 14:38.070
- OK!
- As a hunter, I can tell you.

14:38.171 --> 14:40.005
If you want to catch something,
you gotta be ready to try really,

14:40.106 --> 14:42.174
really hard to catch it. Really hard.

14:43.710 --> 14:48.047
I've hunted everything there is to hunt
in these woods. Deer, coyote,

14:49.207 --> 14:52.284
man I thought was a creature
cause of the way that he was moving.

14:52.385 --> 14:55.221
- Sorry again, Felix.
- ...go on.

14:55.322 --> 14:59.058
So... if you really
want to catch this beast,

14:59.159 --> 15:01.060
you gotta be ready to
get out there tonight

15:01.161 --> 15:04.930
and strike without hesitation! Yeah?

15:05.031 --> 15:07.633
- I got a big old bag of weapons here.
- Holy smoke!

15:08.447 --> 15:11.003
- Let's go kill the beast!
- Yeah!

15:15.108 --> 15:17.142
I can see why you like her, man.
She's nuts!

15:17.244 --> 15:21.280
Kill the beast!
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

15:24.951 --> 15:28.220
- This is such a stupid idea.
- What are you talking about?

15:28.321 --> 15:30.389
The Tennesen boys out
in the woods in a posse,

15:30.490 --> 15:32.358
looking for Dad, trying to save him

15:32.459 --> 15:34.360
- from the clutches of the beast.
- "Clutches of the beast"...

15:34.461 --> 15:36.695
Dad's just hiding because
he wants me to feel guilty

15:36.796 --> 15:38.697
- for yelling at him.
- Come on, Andy.

15:38.798 --> 15:40.666
Everyone else is convinced
that it's the beast.

15:40.767 --> 15:43.035
Including Molly Field who, by the way,

15:43.136 --> 15:46.105
is looking pretty good.
Didn't notice a fella.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.174
- I doubt she even remembers me.
- She remembers you. Are you kidding me?

15:49.276 --> 15:51.877
The way she said "Hey, sorry,
we're all out of weapons",

15:51.978 --> 15:54.113
but here's a compass and
a bag of flashlights"?

15:54.214 --> 15:56.715
There were sparks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:56.816 --> 16:00.319
Yeah, I can really see like a... summer
romance springing up between you two.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.283
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. I think so.

16:02.769 --> 16:04.234
I see what you're doing. No.

16:04.269 --> 16:05.658
What am I doing?
What are you talking about?

16:05.759 --> 16:07.660
I'm not staying the summer.
I'm waiting till we find Dad

16:07.761 --> 16:09.828
- and then I am out of here.
- Andy, the greatest gift

16:09.930 --> 16:11.997
you can give yourself is to
let love into your heart.

16:12.098 --> 16:14.333
- Hmm? You know who said that?
- No.

16:14.434 --> 16:17.836
Garfield talking to Odie.
In some pretty unconvincing

16:17.938 --> 16:19.972
fan fiction I read.
But that line resonated.

16:20.073 --> 16:23.375
- I liked that line a lot.
- Wait. I'm tired of...

16:24.290 --> 16:26.345
- What's wrong?
- Where is the rest

16:26.446 --> 16:28.681
- of the group?
- Oh, where's the group?

16:28.782 --> 16:30.983
- Hello?
- Hey! Easy, man.

16:31.084 --> 16:33.619
- You don't need to summon the beast. Let's just...
- There's no beast!

16:35.648 --> 16:36.588
What was that?

16:37.036 --> 16:39.191
Oh, I think
that might have been the beast.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.360
It wasn't the beast. It was just...

16:41.461 --> 16:43.529
- just a wild animal.
- I don't think

16:43.630 --> 16:45.698
- that makes it better, Andy.
- Yeah, you're right.

16:45.799 --> 16:47.700
- What do we do?
- I think we run.

16:47.801 --> 16:51.470
- What? OK, OK, OK!
- We run, you stupid bastard!

16:57.853 --> 17:00.888
- Go, go, go!
- Stop, stop, stop!

17:00.989 --> 17:04.759
- Where are we, man?
- I don't know. Keep going!

17:07.262 --> 17:11.398
In here! In here! In here!
In here! Here. OK.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.502
OK. Let's just stay here for a second.

17:14.603 --> 17:17.171
- You know what I mean.
- I think I figured it out.

17:17.271 --> 17:19.173
The beast and I have a connection.

17:19.273 --> 17:21.175
If I could see it in my dream,
then it can probably see me

17:21.276 --> 17:23.176
- and now it's coming to close the loop.
- Will you shut up?

17:23.278 --> 17:25.479
We just have
to keep our voices down and...

17:25.579 --> 17:27.348
- Aaaah!
- What is it?

17:27.449 --> 17:30.451
- Should I stab it with my pitchfork?
- No, no! It's... it's a person.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.487
Dad?

17:35.457 --> 17:38.125
Dad, are you OK?

17:39.177 --> 17:41.362
- Should I stab him with my pitchfork now?
- No, you should not stab him

17:41.463 --> 17:42.493
with a pitchfork!

17:43.899 --> 17:47.034
- Oh, my goodness.
- He's had some sort

17:47.135 --> 17:49.103
of psychotic break.
We have to get him to the hospital.

17:49.204 --> 17:51.372
No, we can't go out there.
There's a beast out there!

17:51.473 --> 17:53.541
- There is no beast!
- Beast...

17:53.642 --> 17:55.543
- See?
- He is delirious. Get him up.

17:55.644 --> 17:57.784
You know what? Actually, yeah.
Because if the beast brought him here,

17:57.880 --> 18:00.381
then it's probably gonna
come back for him. Alright.

18:00.482 --> 18:02.483
Let's go, Daddy.
How are you feeling, man?

18:02.584 --> 18:05.152
- You good?
- OK.

18:07.383 --> 18:08.622
What was that?

18:08.724 --> 18:11.325
Oh no! It's the beast!
It's come to close the loop.

18:11.426 --> 18:14.295
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go, man. Go, man. Just go.

18:14.396 --> 18:16.038
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

18:17.399 --> 18:19.934
Oh, crap! It's the beast! Oh!

18:20.377 --> 18:21.165
God, Andy!

18:21.237 --> 18:24.672
- You just stabbed a little kid!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

18:24.773 --> 18:26.841
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Hey!

18:26.942 --> 18:29.844
You OK? Hey, buddy.
Um... We should probably

18:29.945 --> 18:31.979
get out story straight.
I thought you were the beast.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.043
Jacob!

18:35.289 --> 18:36.650
What the hell did you do to my son?

18:36.752 --> 18:38.719
- Oh, crap. She's got a son.
- He came running

18:38.820 --> 18:40.588
out of nowhere. I thought...
I thought he was the beast.

18:40.689 --> 18:42.523
He's 8 years old! He was scared!

18:42.624 --> 18:44.658
Why did you bring an
8-year-old to hunt a beast?

18:44.760 --> 18:47.328
- Why would you stab a child?
- OK. I don't want to sound

18:47.429 --> 18:49.964
like a jerk here,
but you're the one who said we should

18:50.065 --> 18:52.199
- strike without hesitation, so...
- You son of a bitch!

18:53.878 --> 18:54.802
Woah! Get off!

18:55.995 --> 18:57.896
So, I know that wasn't the ideal reunion

18:57.997 --> 18:59.898
between you and Molly,
but when she attacked you,

18:59.999 --> 19:01.833
- I didn't see a ring.
- Can you just please shut up?

19:01.934 --> 19:03.835
Or what?
You're gonna wait until I have a kid

19:03.936 --> 19:06.104
- and then stab it?
- Please, just shut up!

19:06.205 --> 19:09.174
Come in, boys! Dr. Green is
just explaining what happened.

19:09.275 --> 19:12.010
Well, due to your father's memory loss,
it is going to be difficult

19:12.111 --> 19:14.810
to pin down a precise sequence
of events, but it does appear

19:14.845 --> 19:16.181
that he sleepwalked into the forest,
got lost

19:16.282 --> 19:19.251
and suffered a nervous breakdown
due to his general poor health.

19:19.793 --> 19:21.553
At least, that's what the
doctor side of me has to say.

19:21.588 --> 19:23.931
Personally, I think this is
a classic case of the beast.

19:23.966 --> 19:25.857
- I knew it!
- OK. Time to see

19:25.892 --> 19:27.521
how the stitches are holding
up on that child you stabbed.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.534
So you stabbed a child?

19:30.569 --> 19:32.364
- Did you?
- And not only did Andy stab a kid,

19:32.465 --> 19:34.766
it was the son of a woman
he used to have a crush on.

19:34.867 --> 19:38.281
Molly? Oh, she's a catch!
And I happen to know

19:38.316 --> 19:41.876
- she's single.
- Woah! There you go, Andy.

19:41.911 --> 19:47.362
If you can convince her to forget
you stabbed her son, she's all yours.

19:47.397 --> 19:50.382
That's great, thank you, Dad. Thanks.

19:52.470 --> 19:53.385
Oh...

19:54.665 --> 19:56.421
Yes. Um, Andy...

19:57.222 --> 19:59.590
- I'm sorry about last night.
- What?

19:59.691 --> 20:03.094
I'm sorry about last night.

20:03.195 --> 20:06.297
I'm glad you're back and
I know you were thinking

20:06.398 --> 20:09.433
of leaving, but if you did
choose to stay, then...

20:09.534 --> 20:12.670
there's a room for you
as long as you want.

20:12.771 --> 20:15.339
- Wow!
- Up to you. Well.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.441
Um...

20:17.542 --> 20:21.012
OK. I guess we could stay
a couple of extra days,

20:21.113 --> 20:24.015
- see where it goes from there.
- Sounds like a yes to me!

20:24.116 --> 20:26.450
No, that is a tentative yes.
It is not a full yes.

20:26.551 --> 20:30.354
- A nice full yes.
- Great. So just let know when you want me to draw you.

20:30.455 --> 20:32.323
- Uh... Not gonna do that.
- No, we're... we're cool.

20:32.424 --> 20:35.026
- It's gonna be great.
- So, Dad, gotta ask.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.828
- Hmm-mm?
- Do you remember seeing the beast at all last night?

20:37.929 --> 20:39.964
The only thing I can remember

20:40.065 --> 20:43.667
is seeing Andy in the
cave and then thinking:

20:43.769 --> 20:46.637
"If I stab him now,
I can plead insanity".

20:48.380 --> 20:49.807
That was nice for one second.

20:49.908 --> 20:52.343
It was nice.

20:52.444 --> 20:54.512
I just remembered something.
After Andy stabbed Molly's son

20:54.613 --> 20:56.480
last night, he told him he wanted

20:56.581 --> 20:58.549
- to get their story straight.
- No. There is..

20:58.650 --> 21:01.152
I'm not kidding!
He said that to a child.

21:01.253 --> 21:04.188
- A bleeding child!
- There's a reason for that.

21:04.289 --> 21:06.090
He's positively evil!
