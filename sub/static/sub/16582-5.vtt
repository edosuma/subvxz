WEBVTT

00:06.087 --> 00:07.433
Previously on "Graves"...

00:07.454 --> 00:10.614
It's a homosexual wedding,
for God's sake.

00:10.615 --> 00:13.614
One gay wedding and you're
hitting on Barney Frank.

00:13.615 --> 00:16.614
- This is my life.
- It won't be if you run for Senate.

00:16.615 --> 00:17.614
It can't be.

00:17.615 --> 00:18.614
Lawrence just called,

00:18.615 --> 00:20.367
and he said if I did decide to run,

00:20.368 --> 00:21.614
he's on board.

00:21.615 --> 00:25.614
You feel this, right?
I mean, this is crazy.

00:25.615 --> 00:26.614
Open up.

00:26.615 --> 00:28.614
Bitch is nuts, ese.

00:28.615 --> 00:30.614
- Jonathan.
- Sorry, I wanted to ask

00:30.615 --> 00:32.613
if you would give the keynote

00:32.615 --> 00:34.614
at my annual Red Cross
fundraiser next week.

00:34.615 --> 00:36.614
Jeremy's gonna appear
on "Good Day Santa Fe."

00:36.615 --> 00:39.614
Let's talk about your father.
He's been erratic lately.

00:39.615 --> 00:43.614
I'm gonna come over there and beat
the fucking truth into you.

00:43.615 --> 00:46.614
I'm going to a really rad concert
Friday night if you want to hang.

00:46.615 --> 00:48.615
Yeah, sure. I'd love to hang.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.614
This is CNN Breaking News.

00:54.615 --> 00:56.614
- Sad news out of...
- You called for me, sir?

00:56.615 --> 00:57.614
- Shh, shh.
- CNN has just learned

00:57.615 --> 00:59.614
that former Prime Minister Trevor Lloyd

00:59.615 --> 01:02.614
has checked into Johns
Hopkins in Baltimore

01:02.615 --> 01:05.614
for what's being reported as a last
attempt cancer treatment.

01:05.615 --> 01:08.614
- Oh, shit.
- Celebrated when elected,

01:08.615 --> 01:11.291
Lloyd lost the support
of the British people,

01:11.292 --> 01:12.614
not to mention the Royal Family,

01:12.615 --> 01:15.190
when he aligned himself politically

01:15.191 --> 01:17.901
with former American
President Richard Graves.

01:17.902 --> 01:19.614
Turn it off. Off!

01:19.615 --> 01:20.615
Yes, sure.

01:22.615 --> 01:23.614
So sorry, sir.

01:23.615 --> 01:25.614
Tell Ramona I need to pack.

01:25.615 --> 01:27.614
We're going to Baltimore.

01:27.615 --> 01:31.615
- Now, literally?
- No, we're gonna wait till he's dead.

01:36.615 --> 01:39.614
- Hello?
- Hey, Sammy. It's me, Isaiah.

01:39.615 --> 01:42.614
Yeah, I know. It's super early.

01:42.615 --> 01:43.614
I know. I'm sorry.

01:43.615 --> 01:44.893
I just, um...

01:45.615 --> 01:47.614
unfortunately, I'm not gonna be able
to make it to that concert tonight.

01:47.615 --> 01:49.614
Oh, yeah, that's cool, man.

01:49.615 --> 01:50.614
We can do it another time.

01:50.615 --> 01:52.614
Oh, definitely. Please.

01:52.639 --> 01:53.989
I was really looking forward to it.

01:54.014 --> 01:57.615
I just... I have to go with the president
last minute to Baltimore.

01:58.615 --> 02:00.434
No shit.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:39.615 --> 02:42.614
You know, you guys are doing
me a real solid here.

02:42.615 --> 02:46.614
You wouldn't believe
how ridiculously pricey airfare is.

02:46.615 --> 02:47.614
For me, anyway.

02:47.615 --> 02:50.615
Oh, no, for anyone. Are you kidding?

02:54.615 --> 02:57.071
Mm. Dude.

02:57.072 --> 02:59.614
Sad Prez is giving me so many feelings.

02:59.615 --> 03:03.043
It's like, this
was his friend, you know?

03:03.044 --> 03:04.614
Oh, yeah, no. Everybody always said

03:04.615 --> 03:08.614
that Graves was the cowboy,
Trevor Lloyd his lapdog.

03:08.615 --> 03:11.614
I think he feels responsible
for what happened to the prime minister.

03:11.615 --> 03:14.615
You know, how he got run out of office.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.614
Hey, darlin'.

03:20.615 --> 03:21.614
Are you on the plane?

03:21.615 --> 03:23.614
Yes. Actually, we're almost there.

03:23.615 --> 03:25.614
Honey, I just don't know

03:25.615 --> 03:28.614
quite how I'm feeling, what to do.

03:28.615 --> 03:31.614
Oh, Richard, I should've gone
with you for support.

03:31.615 --> 03:32.614
I can still cancel this.

03:32.615 --> 03:34.614
I'll hop on a commercial
flight to Baltimore.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.614
- I'm just a few hours behind you.
- No, no, no.

03:37.615 --> 03:40.248
Honey, I'm gonna be fine.
I'll figure it out.

03:40.249 --> 03:44.614
What you're doing is really
important for you today.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.615
I love you, Mags.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.614
Well, that's disturbing, but beautiful.

04:03.615 --> 04:06.614
That's what my mother always
said about Kitty Dukakis.

04:06.615 --> 04:08.614
I used to paint when I was a kid,

04:08.615 --> 04:11.614
but Daddy said
it was too dark and street

04:11.615 --> 04:13.614
for his uber-Christian base.

04:13.615 --> 04:15.614
Hey, stop being judged by the world,

04:15.615 --> 04:17.281
listening to all their voices.

04:17.281 --> 04:19.613
I don't let anyone judge me.

04:22.413 --> 04:23.614
Sorry.

04:23.615 --> 04:25.439
Yo, compadre.

04:26.615 --> 04:28.586
Yes, yes, see you in an hour,

04:28.611 --> 04:30.614
text you address.

04:30.615 --> 04:33.156
- I have to leave for work, mi amor.
- What? No.

04:33.157 --> 04:35.614
- Baby, you can't.
- I have to.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.614
I want you to stay in this room with me

04:37.615 --> 04:39.614
until we grow old and we die.

04:39.615 --> 04:40.614
I won't be gone long.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.615
I promise.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.615
It's already forever.

04:49.148 --> 04:51.614
Sir, you've received
a bouquet from David Cameron.

04:51.615 --> 04:53.614
Should I send him a thank-you
note on your behalf?

04:53.615 --> 04:56.614
- Please.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

05:00.615 --> 05:02.614
Lloyd, you look like shit.

05:02.615 --> 05:04.614
- Sir.
- It's all right, Ali.

05:04.615 --> 05:06.614
No need for concern.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.614
All former presidents have a certain

05:08.615 --> 05:10.614
startled desperation to them.

05:10.615 --> 05:12.615
You can leave us.

05:21.376 --> 05:23.375
I came as soon as I heard.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.614
And what exactly have you heard?

05:25.914 --> 05:29.235
Cancer. Bad.

05:29.569 --> 05:32.615
Heh. I should have been stricken
with the good cancer.

05:35.615 --> 05:38.048
I'm sorry it's been so long.

05:38.615 --> 05:40.614
Really, Richard, it's okay.

05:40.615 --> 05:44.614
This happens to be a routine stay.
I'm not on my deathbed.

05:44.615 --> 05:46.615
Hope I didn't disappoint you.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.614
Oh.

05:48.615 --> 05:52.614
You're still pissed at me, huh?

05:52.615 --> 05:54.347
"The Dolt of Downing."

05:54.348 --> 05:55.953
That's what the British press called me.

05:55.954 --> 05:57.614
Well, you know, I could write a book

05:57.615 --> 05:59.614
on all the things I've been called.

05:59.615 --> 06:01.614
Yet your books refer to triumphs.

06:01.615 --> 06:03.920
Statues erected in your honor.

06:03.921 --> 06:07.614
I was brutalized
by the press, Parliament.

06:07.615 --> 06:10.614
In private, the queen once told me

06:10.615 --> 06:12.614
that I was nothing more than a boil

06:12.615 --> 06:14.614
on the ass of that American cowboy.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.614
- That bitch.
- And you!

06:16.615 --> 06:18.614
Not one bloody fucking time

06:18.615 --> 06:20.321
did you pick up the telephone.

06:20.322 --> 06:24.222
But more, I was your friend, Richard.

06:30.393 --> 06:32.307
- Hit me.
- What?

06:32.355 --> 06:33.614
- Don't be daft.
- Come on.

06:33.615 --> 06:35.954
Get out of that fucking bed,

06:35.955 --> 06:39.110
and you're gonna punch me
right in the fucking face.

06:39.111 --> 06:40.614
Let's clean the slate.

06:40.615 --> 06:43.914
You know, I lost an election for you.

06:43.939 --> 06:45.614
I cost you your legacy.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.614
So get your balls out
of your goddamn pocketbook

06:47.615 --> 06:50.129
and get up here and hit me in the face!

06:56.615 --> 06:59.614
You've visited, Richard. Kindness noted.

06:59.615 --> 07:00.905
Go on. Get out.

07:09.615 --> 07:13.759
And now you're gonna die
still being a boil on my ass.

07:17.615 --> 07:19.614
God!

07:19.615 --> 07:20.614
Damn, that hurt.

07:20.615 --> 07:23.615
Why, you old limey fuck!

07:35.615 --> 07:36.614
You should have seen your face.

07:36.615 --> 07:40.614
Utter shock. Priceless!

07:40.615 --> 07:44.614
Trevor, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

07:44.615 --> 07:47.614
See, I've been going through something,

07:47.615 --> 07:49.270
the way I see things.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.614
I think you'll...

07:51.615 --> 07:53.021
you'll understand.

07:54.615 --> 07:58.614
And it's the only gift
I have left to give you.

07:58.615 --> 08:00.403
Really?

08:01.175 --> 08:02.615
And what gift is that?

08:04.615 --> 08:05.614
Ali, could you be a dear

08:05.615 --> 08:07.614
and get me a packet of crisps

08:07.615 --> 08:09.614
and a soda from the cafeteria?

08:09.615 --> 08:11.614
I need something salty and sweet.

08:11.615 --> 08:12.849
- There's a good chap.
- Yes, sir. Of course.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.615
Salty and sweet.

08:19.615 --> 08:22.614
Let's go! Let's go! Come on, kids.

08:22.615 --> 08:23.979
Meet the prime minister!

08:23.980 --> 08:25.614
Hello, sir.

08:25.615 --> 08:29.614
- What's up?
- Pleasure's entirely mine.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.114
- Yeah?
- Jeremy.

08:37.139 --> 08:40.614
This is Emery Rozman,
Paradigm Talent Agency.

08:40.615 --> 08:42.011
Okay.

08:42.037 --> 08:44.322
Saw your "Good Morning Santa Fe"
appearance, bro.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.157
Mind blown. "Beat the truth into you"?

08:47.158 --> 08:48.614
If that camera was a chick,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.614
she'd be walking bowlegged for a week.

08:50.896 --> 08:52.614
Yeah, I mean, you know,

08:52.615 --> 08:56.614
I guess I do have a certain ease

08:56.615 --> 08:57.614
in front of the camera.

08:57.615 --> 09:01.614
Jeremy, look, Fox, MSNBC, CNN.

09:01.615 --> 09:04.614
Picture this...
son of a president, newsman.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.268
- Like Wolf Blitzer?
- Oh, yeah, fuck Wolf!

09:07.269 --> 09:10.090
Like Jeremy Graves!
Dude, I'm telling you,

09:10.091 --> 09:11.615
just think about it, man.

09:13.615 --> 09:17.614
30 years ago, I wasn't
even registered to vote.

09:17.615 --> 09:20.614
I had a small computer
company and a magazine,

09:20.615 --> 09:23.614
and my business needed tax relief
or it was gonna go bankrupt.

09:23.615 --> 09:26.614
Then I met President Graves,

09:26.615 --> 09:27.614
and I was inspired.

09:27.615 --> 09:30.176
Not only did Richard
Graves' economic policies

09:30.177 --> 09:32.614
help my businesses grow and expand,

09:32.615 --> 09:36.614
but he also introduced me
to his much better other half.

09:36.615 --> 09:39.614
Ah.

09:39.615 --> 09:43.195
And now, it gives me great
pleasure to introduce to you

09:43.220 --> 09:46.043
my great friend Margaret Graves.

09:48.615 --> 09:50.615
Thank you, Jonathan.

09:54.615 --> 09:56.614
Not so bad.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.615
I can do this.

10:01.615 --> 10:02.615
Not so bad.

10:31.615 --> 10:33.614
No, no, no.

10:33.615 --> 10:35.614
No way. It's not gonna happen.

10:35.615 --> 10:37.614
I'm sorry, sir, but no scenario exists

10:37.615 --> 10:40.614
where I leave you
and the former prime minister

10:40.615 --> 10:43.614
in the middle of Baltimore with no
Secret Service detail whatsoever.

10:43.615 --> 10:46.614
Oh, it exists, Isaiah. This is it.

10:46.615 --> 10:48.614
Now, I'm going over there
and I'm gonna sit

10:48.615 --> 10:51.614
with my old friend and have a slice,

10:51.615 --> 10:55.614
and then I'm going to deposit
him back to the cancer bank.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.614
I owe him big-time.

10:58.615 --> 11:01.614
So now fuck off or you're fired.

11:01.615 --> 11:03.089
- Fired?
- Yes.

11:03.090 --> 11:05.614
- Really, sir?
- Yes.

11:05.615 --> 11:08.614
Iz, it's okay. He's a grown man.

11:08.615 --> 11:10.315
You can loosen your grip a little.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.614
No, Sammy, my whole job
is about the grip.

11:12.615 --> 11:14.614
It's what it is. Hold on to him.

11:14.615 --> 11:15.614
Never let go, no matter what.

11:15.615 --> 11:17.614
Okay, so now you get
to spend some time with me,

11:17.615 --> 11:20.628
and to be honest...

11:21.940 --> 11:23.487
What?

11:24.615 --> 11:25.614
I need you to come with me.

11:25.615 --> 11:28.615
- Where?
- You'll see.

11:31.615 --> 11:34.614
Trev, do you ever miss it?

11:34.615 --> 11:37.614
The power to change events,

11:37.615 --> 11:39.119
you know, affect the conversation?

11:39.120 --> 11:42.715
Oh, at first, but not for years, really.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.264
We're old leather chairs, Richard.

11:46.265 --> 11:49.130
Dependable. Unexciting.

11:49.131 --> 11:51.614
This world isn't meant for us.

11:51.615 --> 11:54.615
But we made this world, right?

12:00.615 --> 12:02.614
- Now, I know that look.
- What look?

12:02.615 --> 12:04.301
No, no, that's the "Ooh,

12:04.326 --> 12:06.614
let's pre-emptively
invade a foreign nation!"

12:06.615 --> 12:10.614
Or "Please, may we impose
economic sanctions, Trev?"

12:10.615 --> 12:13.614
That look is what
my nightmares are made of.

12:13.615 --> 12:17.615
If anything, this look
will set you free.

12:18.615 --> 12:22.615
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

12:23.615 --> 12:25.614
What do you think?

12:25.615 --> 12:27.211
I think these people have
way too much cash

12:27.212 --> 12:28.614
and no idea where to stick it.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.614
Fantastic speech, Margaret.

12:30.615 --> 12:32.227
Annie, thank you.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.614
Well, then again, they're
just words on a page

12:34.615 --> 12:35.890
until they come out of your mouth.

12:37.615 --> 12:39.263
Lawrence Mills, Annie Novak.

12:39.264 --> 12:40.890
Do you two know each other?

12:41.615 --> 12:43.614
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:43.615 --> 12:45.614
I'm really surprised to see you here.

12:45.615 --> 12:47.614
Oh, well, I'm going to be everywhere

12:47.615 --> 12:49.614
until I hopefully get a yes.

12:49.615 --> 12:51.614
I need more time, Annie.

12:51.615 --> 12:53.614
I haven't even talked to my kids.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.614
I understand, but our window is closing.

12:55.615 --> 12:58.614
We have about a month, so I am
gonna pitch until it slams shut.

12:58.615 --> 13:00.614
Look, Thomas Nash is a nightmare.

13:00.615 --> 13:01.844
His polls are rising.

13:01.845 --> 13:03.614
I know. Everyone's worried.

13:03.615 --> 13:05.614
If it's not you, it's going to be him,

13:05.615 --> 13:07.043
and the party's afraid

13:07.044 --> 13:08.614
that we're going to lose the seat

13:08.615 --> 13:09.987
to this fearmongering demagogue.

13:10.012 --> 13:12.614
Okay, I have to step
inside really quickly.

13:12.615 --> 13:15.614
- It was great to see you, Annie.
- Okay.

13:15.615 --> 13:18.614
- And I heard everything you said.
- Okay.

13:18.615 --> 13:21.614
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

13:21.615 --> 13:23.614
Rage! Blow!

13:23.615 --> 13:26.614
You cataracts and hurricanoes,

13:26.615 --> 13:29.614
spout till you've drench'd our steeples,

13:29.615 --> 13:31.614
drown'd the cocks!"

13:31.615 --> 13:33.614
Shut the fuck up or I'm
gonna have these people

13:33.615 --> 13:36.614
pierce your mouth shut.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.614
Richard, it has to be said,

13:39.615 --> 13:41.173
I think this is a terrible idea.

13:41.174 --> 13:45.615
This pain means you're still alive.

13:47.615 --> 13:49.614
"Rumble thy bellyful!"

13:49.615 --> 13:53.615
"Spit, fire! Spout, rain!"

14:05.615 --> 14:07.614
What the fuck?

14:07.615 --> 14:09.614
Just know if you ever do it again

14:09.615 --> 14:11.614
in front of me,

14:11.615 --> 14:13.614
I'm gonna come over there

14:13.615 --> 14:15.614
and beat the truth into you.

14:16.448 --> 14:19.615
Anyway, thanks for having me.

14:20.615 --> 14:21.614
- Liv.
- Hey, Jer.

14:21.615 --> 14:22.963
Are you fucking sitting down?

14:22.964 --> 14:24.614
'Cause you're not gonna believe this.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.614
Little bro's gonna be a TV star.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.614
I'm telling you, for the first time...

14:27.615 --> 14:28.614
Jeremy, listen to me!

14:28.615 --> 14:30.614
- Okay, Jesus.
- Quick question.

14:30.615 --> 14:31.614
Let's say you were at a friend's house

14:31.615 --> 14:35.614
and you accidentally found,

14:35.615 --> 14:37.614
I don't know, like,
a little bit of drugs.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.614
First of all, are you in a closet
and is your friend you?

14:40.615 --> 14:42.614
- No.
- Okay, well, uh,

14:42.615 --> 14:45.282
that shit's poison
and your friend's a fucking moron.

14:45.283 --> 14:46.614
Actually, wait, wait,
wait, wait a second.

14:46.615 --> 14:48.614
What are we talking
about here, like, a joint?

14:48.615 --> 14:51.663
A couple of joints? Occasional
user amount of drugs?

14:51.664 --> 14:53.167
I'm gonna choose to say yes.

14:53.168 --> 14:55.303
Well, then, don't be such
a fucking judge-y bitch about it.

14:55.304 --> 14:58.614
I mean, hey, check a reflection
every once in a while, am I right?

14:58.615 --> 14:59.614
- Glass houses.
- Preach.

14:59.615 --> 15:01.615
- Okay, love you.
- Love you.

15:33.615 --> 15:36.540
Oh, shit.

15:37.615 --> 15:40.614
My Rosemary would've been
horrified by this new tattoo.

15:40.615 --> 15:43.614
- No, she would've loved it.
- Bullshit.

15:43.615 --> 15:47.614
Actually, you know, she probably
wouldn't have cared either way.

15:47.615 --> 15:49.614
By the time she died, we were distant.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.614
It was a dispassionate marriage.

15:52.615 --> 15:55.614
Separate bedrooms. Often separate homes.

15:55.615 --> 15:59.614
During my years in office,
the neglect took its toll, you know?

15:59.615 --> 16:01.252
I don't think that we were
ever really in love.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.614
More a marriage of convenience.

16:03.615 --> 16:06.614
Well, there's a damn shame.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.614
I've never shared this, but, you know,

16:08.615 --> 16:10.614
I was in love once.

16:11.017 --> 16:14.614
Gloria. She worked in
the kitchen at Eaton.

16:14.615 --> 16:16.614
Had these wonderful green eyes.

16:16.615 --> 16:20.614
And her laugh? Oh, magic.

16:20.615 --> 16:22.614
We saw each other every day.

16:23.326 --> 16:25.614
Of course, no chance
of it going anywhere.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.614
Look at that.

16:27.615 --> 16:29.614
Reminds me of London in the early '70s.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.614
I never did participate
in the hippie culture,

16:33.615 --> 16:35.614
the 'shrooms,

16:35.615 --> 16:38.614
the debauchery of the LSD.

16:38.615 --> 16:40.614
Well, never say never, Trev.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.615
That's what this is all about.

16:56.615 --> 16:59.614
Fuck, Liv, enough. Look, I'm
in the middle of something, all right?

16:59.615 --> 17:00.614
Stop!

17:00.615 --> 17:02.614
I need your help.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.614
Do you know what a Kalashnikov is?

17:04.615 --> 17:06.614
- Yeah, it's a big fucking gun.
- Uh-huh.

17:06.615 --> 17:08.154
And, you know, would, say, I don't know,

17:08.179 --> 17:09.614
like, a Mexican day laborer

17:09.615 --> 17:14.614
have a good reason for owning,
I don't know, eight of them?

17:15.963 --> 17:17.614
Maybe 30?

17:17.615 --> 17:20.319
What the hell is going on?
Where are you?

17:20.377 --> 17:22.376
Let's just say I spent the day
breathing in the air,

17:22.377 --> 17:26.262
and it's full of sunshine, only instead
of sunshine, it's cocaine!

17:27.377 --> 17:30.377
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

17:36.377 --> 17:37.617
Olivia.

17:37.618 --> 17:39.008
Where are you going?

17:39.009 --> 17:42.377
- Out of here!
- Wait, wait. What happened?

17:46.377 --> 17:48.950
- Shit.
- You fucked, ese.

17:48.975 --> 17:50.866
Olivia! Olivia, stop!

17:50.867 --> 17:52.377
Come on, let me explain!

18:28.205 --> 18:30.205
Not what I was expecting.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.709
Mom and Dad, Isaiah.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.734
Isaiah, Mom and Dad.

18:38.966 --> 18:42.965
So, um, what are we supposed
to do here, do you think?

18:42.966 --> 18:46.451
Uh, I think... whatever you want.

18:47.262 --> 18:49.261
I just wanted to see it.

18:49.966 --> 18:51.836
You've never been here before?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.689
No, I... well, I tried a few times,

18:56.714 --> 19:00.965
but, you know, childhood trauma and all.

19:00.966 --> 19:03.766
And then I took off.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.289
What happened to them?

19:06.966 --> 19:09.965
Car versus truck. Car lost.

19:09.966 --> 19:13.119
- That's horrible.
- Yeah, well...

19:13.966 --> 19:16.966
we all have dark shit.

19:18.966 --> 19:20.965
I could leave you alone if you want
to say something to them in private.

19:20.966 --> 19:23.966
No. Will you stay with me, please?

19:24.966 --> 19:28.089
- Yeah.
- Besides, I...

19:28.661 --> 19:30.660
I don't even...

19:30.966 --> 19:33.965
I don't even know what the hell
I would say to them.

19:33.966 --> 19:34.965
"Hey, guys. I'm a waitress.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.965
I live with a dude that sells
weed out of our trailer.

19:37.966 --> 19:41.378
Oh, and, Mom, that little heart
tattoo you told me not to get?

19:41.613 --> 19:42.618
Well..."

19:43.966 --> 19:46.195
I mean, it kills me, you know?

19:46.966 --> 19:49.243
I don't think...

19:50.966 --> 19:53.198
I know that they'd hate
how I turned out.

19:53.966 --> 19:57.099
What? No, that's not true.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.698
I can promise you that.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.965
Well, you're incredibly
smart, for starters,

20:03.966 --> 20:06.379
one of the most honest
people I've ever met.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.580
I mean, you have zero fear,

20:08.605 --> 20:12.605
which is a quality that even a former
US president admires.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.966
No, they'd think you're amazing.

20:28.823 --> 20:31.542
- Sammy?
- Hmm?

20:31.567 --> 20:32.567
I like you.

20:34.966 --> 20:36.433
Don't.

20:36.966 --> 20:40.271
If I, or any American,
want to carry a gun,

20:40.272 --> 20:42.965
I can damn well have a gun.

20:42.966 --> 20:45.610
That's my constitutional right.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.965
That's my freedom.

20:46.966 --> 20:48.965
What a load of rubbish.

20:48.966 --> 20:49.965
In Britain we're smart enough

20:49.966 --> 20:51.965
not to shoot each other in the street,

20:51.966 --> 20:54.965
unlike here, where
even you've been shot.

20:54.966 --> 20:56.591
Three times, no less.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.683
If I had been carrying a gun,

20:58.684 --> 21:00.965
I would've been shot only once.

21:00.966 --> 21:02.965
Bam! Pow! Boom! You're dead!

21:02.966 --> 21:04.375
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:04.376 --> 21:06.363
please welcome to our main stage

21:06.364 --> 21:08.965
the beautiful, mystical China!

21:08.966 --> 21:11.965
Let's hear it for fine China!

21:11.966 --> 21:13.965
Sweet heaven.

21:26.966 --> 21:28.319
Gloria.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.965
That's what she looked like.

21:30.966 --> 21:32.966
There. My Gloria.

21:34.966 --> 21:36.966
- That's Gloria?
- Yeah.

21:41.966 --> 21:43.965
It was Christmas of his first term,

21:43.966 --> 21:46.965
and Janet and Richard
passed out before 9:00.

21:46.966 --> 21:50.509
The time you stayed in the Lincoln
Bedroom was New Year's.

21:50.534 --> 21:52.533
No, it was December.

21:52.558 --> 21:54.461
January, because I remember you wearing

21:54.486 --> 21:56.965
this hideous blue velvet tuxedo.

21:56.966 --> 22:01.965
- Cost me a fortune.
- It was hideous.

22:01.966 --> 22:03.884
But I remember that night.

22:04.966 --> 22:06.996
A bottle of absinthe,

22:07.861 --> 22:10.860
two bong hits later
on the Truman Balcony.

22:10.885 --> 22:12.884
We're not gonna talk about that.

22:17.966 --> 22:19.966
Oh, my God.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.965
Okay, no. I have to get back out there.

22:25.966 --> 22:27.965
And so do you.

22:27.966 --> 22:30.966
Now, Maggie, Maggie. Come here.

22:37.213 --> 22:38.966
Ooh!

23:01.966 --> 23:04.965
Baby, you sure you don't
want nothing else?

23:04.966 --> 23:06.966
No, no, no. Thank you, Gloria.

23:08.966 --> 23:09.965
Thank you.

23:09.966 --> 23:12.965
Time's up, hon. That'll be a hundred.

23:12.966 --> 23:14.965
Ah, ooh.

23:14.966 --> 23:18.686
This was a gift from King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia.

23:18.687 --> 23:20.965
The Hope Ruby, it's called.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.965
Ten million pounds at last assessment.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.966
Yours.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.105
Even if this is all bullshit,

23:31.480 --> 23:33.705
you really are one sweet old man.

23:43.966 --> 23:44.965
How the hell did I end up here?

23:44.966 --> 23:46.965
I mean, I could always pretend
to be Mrs. Rockefeller

23:46.966 --> 23:49.965
with some monogrammed towels
and the monthly bikini waxes,

23:49.966 --> 23:51.965
leaving him little love
notes in his briefcase,

23:51.966 --> 23:53.965
which all ate me up inside like cancer,

23:53.966 --> 23:56.965
but at least I understood
that disease, that world.

23:56.966 --> 24:00.425
But rebounding with a drug dealer?
My God, Jeremy.

24:00.426 --> 24:01.965
What's wrong with me?

24:01.966 --> 24:03.966
Tell me. I can handle it.

24:06.766 --> 24:08.766
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

24:11.966 --> 24:13.965
I'm so fucked up.

24:13.966 --> 24:17.187
No, you're just you.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.717
That's a terrible thing to say.

24:20.966 --> 24:23.965
Okay, you're banging
a drug dealer? So what?

24:23.966 --> 24:26.965
Some of the best people
I know are drug dealers.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.965
Look, I'm doing my own thing right now,

24:28.966 --> 24:30.492
as you can probably tell.

24:30.493 --> 24:32.525
- Watching TV?
- No, I'm not watching TV.

24:32.526 --> 24:33.965
I've been trying to
tell you this all day,

24:33.966 --> 24:37.043
but you can't hear me through all
your fucking air-sucking drama.

24:37.966 --> 24:40.965
I'm talking about a commentator, okay?

24:40.966 --> 24:44.573
A news... whatever,
I don't exactly know yet.

24:44.598 --> 24:45.965
But whatever it is,
it's going to be my thing

24:45.966 --> 24:47.965
that I'm doing because I want to do it,

24:47.966 --> 24:49.965
and I don't give a shit what anybody
else has to say about it,

24:49.966 --> 24:51.581
let alone a former president

24:51.606 --> 24:52.965
and first lady, okay?

24:52.966 --> 24:55.965
So you just... you just
do your thing, all right?

24:56.966 --> 24:58.966
Yeah, what's up, Ramona?

25:00.473 --> 25:01.965
This came for you.

25:01.966 --> 25:04.965
It's divorce papers.

25:04.966 --> 25:06.966
So sorry.

25:11.966 --> 25:13.966
It's okay.

25:16.966 --> 25:17.965
Out with the old.

25:21.606 --> 25:23.470
You need to run.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.822
So you'd vote for me?

25:26.032 --> 25:28.032
I'd bet my fortune on you.

25:34.346 --> 25:35.966
- Jonathan.
- No.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.986
Okay. Can't. Just... I'm sorry.

25:42.528 --> 25:44.965
I can't. I just can't do it.

25:44.966 --> 25:47.966
- Maggie.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

25:56.251 --> 25:59.217
So, what's it all about, Graves,

25:59.242 --> 26:00.590
this epiphany of yours?

26:02.966 --> 26:06.072
I wanted to make the world
a better place.

26:06.267 --> 26:07.965
I made it worse.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.965
Oh, you did good, too. We all did.

26:09.966 --> 26:13.965
No, I don't... I don't see that anymore.

26:13.966 --> 26:17.195
I just want to take back
all the pain I caused,

26:17.966 --> 26:19.362
yell out, but...

26:19.966 --> 26:24.965
maybe it's best I just
remain silent and fade away.

26:25.327 --> 26:26.965
No, no, no, no, no.

26:26.966 --> 26:29.965
You stay alive long enough
to yell, Richard,

26:29.966 --> 26:32.965
at the top of your lungs,
and make them listen.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.567
Just remember one thing.

26:34.568 --> 26:38.965
At the end, all that really matters

26:38.966 --> 26:40.965
are those who love us.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.506
They are the hidden victims
of our administrations.

26:43.531 --> 26:46.966
It's not just the country,
but it's our families we hurt.

26:47.861 --> 26:49.861
Are you scared?

26:53.499 --> 26:55.498
Mostly no.

26:55.523 --> 26:57.829
I've read all the books
I wanted to read.

27:00.702 --> 27:04.428
Most evenings,
I find existence rather dull.

27:04.795 --> 27:07.794
Not this evening, though, old friend...

27:07.819 --> 27:09.819
my oldest friend.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.708
Homer wrote,

27:16.966 --> 27:20.965
"I should not have sorrowed
so over his dying

27:20.966 --> 27:25.965
if he had gone down among his companions

27:25.966 --> 27:27.965
in the land of the Trojans,

27:27.966 --> 27:31.965
or into the arms of his friends

27:31.966 --> 27:34.966
after he wound up the fighting."

27:36.785 --> 27:38.654
In his twilight,

27:40.598 --> 27:43.597
Trevor seized the final moments.

27:43.598 --> 27:47.597
The memory I will hold of Trevor

27:47.598 --> 27:50.067
will not be his public image,

27:50.598 --> 27:56.075
but of his private self at the end.

27:57.005 --> 28:03.598
I watched as he shed
the anchor of regret.

28:07.475 --> 28:08.840
God bless him.

28:09.305 --> 28:15.781
