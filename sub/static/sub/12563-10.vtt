00:14.062 --> 00:16.762
So, these guys don't travel with a doctor?

00:16.787 --> 00:18.687
No, they do... it's just for their horses.

00:18.712 --> 00:20.412
Well, it's a pretty sweet gig.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.137
Yeah, it'd be even sweeter if we
were getting our full of that, right?

00:23.162 --> 00:25.462
That's nice you gave them a break,
I mean they're clearly hurting.

00:25.637 --> 00:28.204
Well, to be totally honest, I, uh...

00:28.206 --> 00:30.173
I cut 'em a deal to make sure
you'd be busy.

00:30.175 --> 00:33.075
You know, keep your mind off,
you know, the breakup.

00:33.077 --> 00:35.278
You mean Christina? That wasn't a breakup.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.612
I know, I know.

00:36.614 --> 00:37.914
I was trying to avoid the word "dumped."

00:37.916 --> 00:39.382
What? I did not get dumped.

00:39.384 --> 00:41.651
We just went our separate ways
after a relationship

00:41.653 --> 00:43.119
that could have been but never really was.

00:43.121 --> 00:44.420
Uh-huh. And the term for that is?

00:44.422 --> 00:46.589
- I... can you just...
- Okay, okay.

00:46.591 --> 00:48.591
I have bigger things
to deal with than your...

00:48.593 --> 00:50.693
whatever it was, anyway.

00:50.695 --> 00:52.328
Guess who's coming to town.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.363
I'd say Santa Claus, but
it's summer and we're jewish.

00:54.365 --> 00:55.498
Yeah, I wish it was Santa Claus.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.066
No, the general. Yeah.

00:57.068 --> 00:58.835
He is detouring off the campaign trail

00:58.837 --> 01:00.369
to get some kind of award,

01:00.371 --> 01:05.007
and Paige thinks it's time
for her parents to meet dad.

01:05.009 --> 01:06.242
Sounds reasonable.

01:06.244 --> 01:07.944
Oh, does it? Reasonable?

01:07.946 --> 01:09.979
Her dad used to be a general.

01:09.981 --> 01:13.382
Our dad used to be in
the general population, Henry.

01:13.384 --> 01:15.017
You're getting married, Evan.

01:15.019 --> 01:17.019
I mean, at some point,
the bride's and groom's

01:17.021 --> 01:19.121
families have to meet.

01:19.123 --> 01:20.990
You're right.

01:20.992 --> 01:22.892
You're absolutely right.

01:22.894 --> 01:24.260
"At some point."

01:24.262 --> 01:25.895
I'll just postpone it. Oh, my God.

01:25.897 --> 01:27.997
Mwah. Henry, you're a genius.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.765
- I wasn't...
- Ha ha!

01:29.767 --> 01:31.334
How does he...

01:31.336 --> 01:32.869
Hah!

01:32.871 --> 01:35.238
That a girl, use your toe, not your heel.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.672
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Evan.

01:36.674 --> 01:37.773
- Hi.
- Look at us.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.175
We're stomping on divots.

01:39.177 --> 01:40.376
Oh, wow, that's very exciting.

01:40.378 --> 01:41.544
We have to talk.

01:41.546 --> 01:42.912
You know what's exciting?

01:42.914 --> 01:45.514
That I'm going to get to meet
your future in-laws.

01:45.516 --> 01:46.649
We don't need to talk.

01:46.651 --> 01:48.050
That's exciting, dad.

01:48.052 --> 01:49.518
Friday at 6:00. We have reservations.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.720
Ugh, I have them right now.

01:50.722 --> 01:52.588
- Okay, good.
- How about this?

01:52.590 --> 01:56.292
I now have something
in common with Paige's dad.

01:56.294 --> 01:58.261
Yeah, my dad is on his way to Albany

01:58.263 --> 02:00.229
to receive the humanitarian
medal of valor,

02:00.231 --> 02:01.797
and your dad is up for a bloggie.

02:01.799 --> 02:03.332
Oh, a bloggie.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.668
Well, you know, for self-improvement.

02:05.670 --> 02:07.870
Okay, so it's not a humanitarian award.

02:07.872 --> 02:11.374
But I figure since
I have a little prison time,

02:11.376 --> 02:14.010
my chances are pretty good.

02:14.012 --> 02:15.978
- Good luck, pop.
- Thank you.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.180
- Hello, all.
- Hi.

02:18.182 --> 02:19.348
Enjoying the match?

02:19.350 --> 02:20.549
Yeah.

02:20.551 --> 02:22.385
Well, you know, guys ridin' on horses,

02:22.387 --> 02:25.288
swingin' at balls... what?

02:25.290 --> 02:27.189
- That's the game, isn't it?
- Basically.

02:27.191 --> 02:29.091
I've been to the tournament
nine years running.

02:29.093 --> 02:31.560
And I've never been here
because horses terrify me.

02:31.562 --> 02:33.329
But speaking of getting back on the horse,

02:33.331 --> 02:34.730
Divs, how was your date last night?

02:34.732 --> 02:36.032
Evan, that's personal.

02:36.034 --> 02:37.199
No, it's not.

02:37.201 --> 02:38.534
Unless there was some...

02:38.536 --> 02:39.902
You know... what? Then it would be...

02:39.904 --> 02:42.405
was there any...
You know, was there?

02:42.407 --> 02:44.173
- There was not.
- Oh.

02:44.175 --> 02:46.609
There was barely... I know.

02:46.611 --> 02:48.444
Mm, sounds like you didn't like him.

02:48.446 --> 02:49.812
I liked him fine...

02:49.814 --> 02:52.081
just like I have liked the other two guys

02:52.083 --> 02:53.549
that I have been set up with.

02:53.551 --> 02:55.017
Yeah, but who's looking for like?

02:55.019 --> 02:56.485
- Dre... wh...

02:56.487 --> 02:58.087
Okay.

02:58.089 --> 02:59.322
- Ooh, excuse me.
- Excuse me.

02:59.324 --> 03:00.556
Sorry.

03:00.558 --> 03:02.491
- New shoes.
- Wow. Yow.

03:02.493 --> 03:03.826
Those are some tall new shoes.

03:03.828 --> 03:05.728
Are you stomping divots,
or are you making them?

03:05.730 --> 03:07.596
I'm so...

03:07.598 --> 03:09.332
I'm fine. I'm fine. And you know what?

03:09.334 --> 03:12.034
You don't have to rush,
'cause I'm pretty sure

03:12.036 --> 03:14.570
they're not gonna start
till we leave the field.

03:14.572 --> 03:16.672
Oh, I'm not trying to leave the field.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.975
I'm trying to get to Rafa.

03:18.977 --> 03:21.877
Is he the one who's riding

03:21.879 --> 03:25.614
the beautiful chestnut quarter-horse?

03:25.616 --> 03:27.717
You're looking at his horse? Wow.

03:27.719 --> 03:29.251
I like horses.

03:29.253 --> 03:31.220
Certainly draws a crowd, doesn't he?

03:31.222 --> 03:32.588
Well, have you seen him?

03:32.590 --> 03:34.323
He's 50 shades of, "oh, my God."

03:34.325 --> 03:35.791
"Take me. Take me now."

03:35.793 --> 03:37.827
Oh, I'm guessing
you're not here for the polo.

03:37.829 --> 03:39.228
Polo, shmolo.

03:39.230 --> 03:40.329
Oh, I see an opening.

03:40.331 --> 03:42.498
Nice to meet you all.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.501
Who knew polo players had groupies?

03:46.937 --> 03:49.238
Rafa! Hello, Raf... no!

03:49.240 --> 03:53.242
You... you're playing very well, Rafa.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.485
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:02.487 --> 04:04.053
So, uh, who's winning?

04:04.055 --> 04:06.856
Oh, the, uh... the guys on the, uh, hor...

04:06.858 --> 04:08.090
the, uh... with the m...

04:08.092 --> 04:10.059
I have no idea who's winning.

04:10.061 --> 04:11.460
Okay, thank you.

04:11.462 --> 04:12.928
So are you going to the dinner?

04:12.930 --> 04:15.164
- The dinner?
- Mm-Hmm, Paige's family.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.531
Oh, that.

04:16.534 --> 04:17.933
Uh, no.

04:17.935 --> 04:19.334
I mean, we've met.

04:19.337 --> 04:21.103
You know, I think that
should just be you guys.

04:21.105 --> 04:23.572
If you change your mind,
or if you get lonely,

04:23.574 --> 04:25.274
you call me immediately.

04:25.276 --> 04:27.576
Uh, why would I feel lonely?

04:27.578 --> 04:29.178
Because your brother
just told me you were dumped.

04:29.180 --> 04:30.679
I did not get dumped.

04:30.681 --> 04:32.381
- He did not get dumped.
- You did get dumped.

04:32.383 --> 04:35.084
- You did get dumped?
- I didn't get dumped!

04:41.659 --> 04:42.792
- Ooh.
- Oh!

04:42.794 --> 04:44.193
Simon! Wait, wait.

04:44.195 --> 04:45.995
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time-out.

04:45.997 --> 04:47.463
- Come on, get up.
- I can't.

04:47.465 --> 04:49.665
- Come on, Simon, get up.
- It hurts too much.

05:13.549 --> 05:18.549
Royal Pains 4x10 - Who's Your Daddy
Original air date August 22, 2012

05:18.574 --> 05:23.574
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

05:26.203 --> 05:27.970
- Any pain?
- No.

05:27.972 --> 05:29.238
Did you lose consciousness?

05:29.240 --> 05:30.773
- No.
- Good.

05:30.775 --> 05:32.708
So far it looks like you just
bruised your shoulder.

05:32.710 --> 05:33.976
And my ego.

05:33.978 --> 05:36.212
Well, that I'm not qualified to treat.

05:36.214 --> 05:38.414
Is there anything I can do to help?

05:38.416 --> 05:40.082
Uh, you could give us some room.

05:40.084 --> 05:41.584
As you wish.

05:41.586 --> 05:43.519
I'm surprised you're not
in more pain, Mr. Braddock.

05:43.521 --> 05:46.188
Simon. And I've had harder falls.

05:46.190 --> 05:47.723
- This is true.
- Hey.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.158
I got up from those too.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.559
Well, perhaps you fell deliberately so you

05:50.561 --> 05:52.428
could be treated by the beautiful doctor.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.598
Actually, I am a physician assistant.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.866
I was talking about Hank.

05:58.336 --> 06:00.002
- You are quite beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

06:00.004 --> 06:01.804
Please stand up.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.241
So, uh, how long have
you been playing polo?

06:05.243 --> 06:06.575
Clearly not long enough.

06:06.577 --> 06:07.810
That's true.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.678
I spent my 30s and 40s on Wall Street

06:09.680 --> 06:11.113
when I could've been playing.

06:11.115 --> 06:12.782
But then again, if I hadn't
been working on stuff,

06:12.784 --> 06:14.917
I probably wouldn't have
had the money to buy the team.

06:14.919 --> 06:17.753
- You're a player and the owner?
- Yep.

06:17.755 --> 06:20.456
Even flew to Argentina
to handpick my players.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.358
Rafa I found working in the stables.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.826
And he recognized greatness.

06:23.828 --> 06:25.661
Yeah, he was excellent at shoveling...

06:25.663 --> 06:27.363
This injury time will end

06:27.365 --> 06:28.764
in five minutes.

06:28.766 --> 06:30.800
Five minutes until the next chukker.

06:30.802 --> 06:32.234
Okay, here we go.

06:32.236 --> 06:34.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not for you, I'm afraid.

06:34.205 --> 06:35.471
Clip.

06:35.473 --> 06:37.039
Damn it.

06:37.041 --> 06:39.809
Every year we get so close
to winning the Canterbury Cup,

06:39.811 --> 06:43.279
and every year somehow it just slips away.

06:43.281 --> 06:44.747
Tell Ernesto to sub in,

06:44.749 --> 06:47.650
but you better not lose without me.

06:47.652 --> 06:49.552
The thought never occurred.

06:49.554 --> 06:52.154
Just mount up.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.190
Smart guy.

06:57.894 --> 06:59.428
So I took the liberty of having

06:59.430 --> 07:01.597
your best suit cleaned and pressed, okay?

07:01.599 --> 07:02.998
I don't have a best suit.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.533
I also took the liberty of buying you one.

07:04.535 --> 07:05.801
Oh.

07:05.803 --> 07:07.570
So just keep it in the bag
till tomorrow night.

07:07.572 --> 07:09.638
And don't be late, all right?

07:09.640 --> 07:12.174
The general's very particular
about punctuality.

07:12.176 --> 07:13.776
Well, what is he gonna do if I'm late?

07:13.778 --> 07:15.144
He's gonna throw me in the brig?

07:15.146 --> 07:16.812
- Maybe.
- Yeah? No, come on.

07:16.814 --> 07:18.114
The man... relax.

07:18.116 --> 07:20.015
He puts his pants on one leg at a time

07:20.017 --> 07:21.517
- like everybody else.
- He does.

07:21.519 --> 07:24.220
But his pants are part
of a four-star general uniform.

07:24.222 --> 07:28.157
So that's why I've prepared
this list of topics for you.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.828
Uh-huh. Good, good, good, good.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.096
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:34.098 --> 07:35.798
So these are great conversation starters.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.233
Great.

07:37.235 --> 07:39.969
These are not conversation starters, dad.

07:39.971 --> 07:42.138
These are topics to be avoided, okay?

07:42.140 --> 07:45.241
- Avoided.
- Religion, politics, race,

07:45.243 --> 07:46.842
- pri... windmills?
- Yes.

07:46.844 --> 07:48.344
That's a whole thing, but yes.

07:48.346 --> 07:49.712
Well, what can I talk about?

07:49.714 --> 07:52.214
Me as an adorable child, uh,

07:52.216 --> 07:54.984
the weather, and golf.

07:54.986 --> 07:57.553
Not Tiger Woods though,
all right? I mean it.

07:57.555 --> 07:59.522
You know that I've had
dinner with adults before?

07:59.524 --> 08:00.990
That I can actually cut my own meat?

08:00.992 --> 08:02.391
Yes, dad, I...

08:02.393 --> 08:04.326
I know exactly what I'm gonna talk about.

08:04.328 --> 08:05.728
- What?
- Well, my nomination

08:05.730 --> 08:07.263
- for a bloggie.
- No.

08:07.265 --> 08:08.998
No, that falls under prison.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.767
Yes, yes, but in
the self-improvement category.

08:11.769 --> 08:13.469
- Dad, you wrote it...
- Hey, guys.

08:13.471 --> 08:15.004
- How's it going?
- Oh, I've just had

08:15.006 --> 08:17.806
an exhilarating time here with Emily Post.

08:17.808 --> 08:21.610
And I will be P.P. tomorrow night...

08:21.612 --> 08:23.179
particularly punctual.

08:23.181 --> 08:25.781
I just gotta get my suit.

08:25.783 --> 08:29.552
Okay, gotta keep it in the bag.

08:29.554 --> 08:32.087
What was that about?

08:32.089 --> 08:34.056
Uh, just prepping him
for dinner with your parents.

08:34.058 --> 08:36.225
Evan, you don't need to prep him.

08:36.227 --> 08:39.395
Your dad is totally lovable.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.030
To you and me, yes, I know.

08:41.032 --> 08:43.499
- But... but your dad is...
- Careful.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.502
Another story... another story.

08:46.504 --> 08:48.504
I just want it to be good, you know?

08:48.506 --> 08:50.506
I want things to work out.

08:50.508 --> 08:52.641
I just want your family to like my family.

08:52.643 --> 08:54.577
And I want that too.

08:54.579 --> 08:58.347
But cranking up the pressure
on your dad and yourself

08:58.349 --> 09:00.049
is not gonna help.

09:00.051 --> 09:01.650
What you need to do is relax.

09:01.652 --> 09:02.985
Yes, I know.

09:02.987 --> 09:04.019
It's easier said than done though.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.421
I'm, like...

09:05.423 --> 09:06.922
I'm gonna be a puddle of flop sweat

09:06.924 --> 09:08.390
before I even get there.

09:08.392 --> 09:10.726
Well, then show up
to the Blackstone early.

09:10.728 --> 09:12.194
In fact, go super early,

09:12.196 --> 09:14.096
get a message, take a steam

09:14.098 --> 09:17.166
take a jacuzzi, and get dressed
in the locker room.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.134
That way you're gonna be rested and ready

09:19.136 --> 09:21.070
and totally de-stressed.

09:21.072 --> 09:22.838
That's a fantastic idea.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.841
I know.

09:32.916 --> 09:35.918
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.420
Div... ine?

09:38.422 --> 09:40.022
Uh, Divya.

09:40.024 --> 09:42.625
Sorry, you must get that a lot.

09:42.627 --> 09:44.126
Well, not really, no.

09:44.128 --> 09:45.561
Have you seen Rafa?

09:45.563 --> 09:46.929
No.

09:46.931 --> 09:49.698
But, uh, if you listen for the sounds

09:49.700 --> 09:52.134
of squealing women, I suspect
that you will find him.

09:53.504 --> 09:55.070
- Sorry, that was rude.
- Oh, not at all.

09:55.072 --> 09:58.040
No, no, those women are part
of why I need to see him.

09:58.042 --> 09:59.575
I'm confused.

09:59.577 --> 10:01.410
Aren't they your competition?

10:01.412 --> 10:02.945
Oh, I'm not trying to sleep with him.

10:02.947 --> 10:04.647
I just want him in my underwear.

10:04.649 --> 10:06.949
Still confused.

10:06.951 --> 10:10.019
My card.

10:10.021 --> 10:12.321
"Fannie Todd, president,"

10:12.323 --> 10:15.190
"Fancied Pants...
high-end, high-performance"

10:15.192 --> 10:17.259
"undergarments for men and women."

10:17.261 --> 10:19.862
I'm a tiny company
with even tinier products,

10:19.864 --> 10:21.330
even though I've been at it for years.

10:21.332 --> 10:22.965
But if I can get Rafa
to model some of my stuff

10:22.967 --> 10:24.533
before another designer gets to him,

10:24.535 --> 10:26.335
it could make me big.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.737
- So you're a businesswoman?
- Mm-Hmm.

10:28.739 --> 10:31.073
And here I thought that
you were just one of those...

10:31.075 --> 10:35.077
Crazy ladies who want
to ride Rafa like a polo pony?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.751
I guess your shoulder's feeling better.

10:42.753 --> 10:44.953
Hey, Hank, yeah.

10:44.955 --> 10:47.022
Yeah, it is. Oats for you?

10:47.024 --> 10:48.424
Uh, already had breakfast.

10:48.426 --> 10:50.192
- But thank you.
- Suit yourself.

10:50.194 --> 10:51.493
I watched ya out there.

10:51.495 --> 10:52.995
You're no amateur. You're good.

10:52.997 --> 10:54.697
You flatter me.

10:54.699 --> 10:57.132
But it comes with a question attached.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.534
A horseman like you doesn't suddenly

10:58.536 --> 11:00.903
go flying without any contact.

11:00.905 --> 11:03.772
So the question is,
did you hurt your shoulder

11:03.774 --> 11:05.240
because you fell, or did you fall

11:05.242 --> 11:07.543
because your shoulder already hurt?

11:10.481 --> 11:12.614
It's been going on for a few days...

11:12.616 --> 11:16.251
this, uh, jolt of pain that
hits me like a lightning bolt.

11:17.421 --> 11:18.787
That's why I fell.

11:18.789 --> 11:21.457
I just didn't want to admit it
in front of my team.

11:21.459 --> 11:22.624
Why?

11:22.626 --> 11:24.560
I mean, it's your team.

11:24.562 --> 11:27.062
Exactly, which is why this question

11:27.064 --> 11:28.564
is always hanging over me.

11:28.566 --> 11:30.265
Am I on the team because I deserve to be,

11:30.267 --> 11:31.967
or because I own it?

11:31.969 --> 11:35.204
I mean, they're just kids,
you know? And I'm...

11:35.206 --> 11:36.372
Look, you can't change the fact that

11:36.374 --> 11:37.639
you're twice the age of your teammates.

11:37.641 --> 11:38.941
Easy, doctor.

11:38.943 --> 11:40.609
I'm only twice as old as some of them.

11:41.912 --> 11:43.245
I consider myself to be 18,

11:43.247 --> 11:46.248
but with 32 years extra experience.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.483
Okay.

11:47.485 --> 11:49.385
But I don't think they see it that way.

11:49.387 --> 11:52.020
This isn't Wall Street
where money buys respect.

11:52.022 --> 11:53.188
You gotta earn it on the field.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.523
Well, let's get you well enough

11:54.525 --> 11:55.758
so you can do that.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.493
I'm gonna do some blood work and an X-ray.

11:57.495 --> 11:58.761
My portable's in the car.

11:58.763 --> 12:01.764
I'll be right back.

12:29.159 --> 12:30.292
- Paige.
- Oh, hey!

12:30.294 --> 12:31.393
- Hey.
- How are you?

12:31.395 --> 12:32.628
Good, good, good.

12:32.630 --> 12:34.263
Pretend we're having a conversation.

12:34.265 --> 12:35.764
We are having a conversation.

12:35.766 --> 12:38.434
Good, very good.

12:38.436 --> 12:40.002
Now, act concerned.

12:40.004 --> 12:42.371
I am concerned.

12:42.373 --> 12:43.605
Did you steal something?

12:43.607 --> 12:46.074
No. No, no, no.

12:46.076 --> 12:49.445
The guy that I went out with
the other night, David,

12:49.447 --> 12:51.613
- he's here.
- Oh.

12:51.615 --> 12:53.282
And you don't want to deal with him?

12:53.284 --> 12:55.651
No- no, no, don't look.

12:55.653 --> 12:57.352
Of course I don't want to deal with him.

12:57.354 --> 13:00.255
He obviously likes me
more than I like him.

13:00.257 --> 13:03.292
And dealing with him would
only hurt his feelings.

13:09.566 --> 13:10.766
Okay.

13:10.768 --> 13:12.167
Okay, good. Good, he's gone.

13:12.169 --> 13:15.170
Thank you. Thank you.

13:16.773 --> 13:18.607
I can't tell you how frustrating

13:18.609 --> 13:20.209
this whole thing is.

13:20.211 --> 13:22.177
Divya, maybe if you just talked to him,

13:22.179 --> 13:23.278
- you could tell him.
- No, no,

13:23.280 --> 13:24.413
not that whole thing.

13:24.415 --> 13:27.749
This whole... dating thing.

13:27.751 --> 13:30.986
Veronica my matchmaker, she set me up with

13:30.988 --> 13:32.621
three different guys.

13:32.623 --> 13:33.989
Each have them have been precisely

13:33.991 --> 13:37.459
what I said I wanted, but... zippo.

13:39.029 --> 13:41.964
Is it possible that you only

13:41.966 --> 13:43.432
think you know what you want?

13:43.434 --> 13:45.834
Or what maybe you haven't

13:45.836 --> 13:47.970
been honest with her about it?

13:47.972 --> 13:50.772
Well, that's an interesting theory.

13:50.774 --> 13:53.075
But I think that I have
been honest with Veronica

13:53.077 --> 13:55.577
- and to myself.
- Okay.

13:55.579 --> 13:59.581
The person I have not
been honest with is David.

14:05.823 --> 14:07.990
Looks like you've made
a miraculous recovery.

14:07.992 --> 14:09.458
Not exactly.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.493
That pain in my right shoulder
that I aggravated

14:11.495 --> 14:14.296
lifting that lid, it's moved to my left.

14:14.298 --> 14:16.431
- I don't like that.
- You?

14:16.433 --> 14:17.699
I'm a fiscal conservative.

14:17.701 --> 14:19.601
I don't like anything to move to the left.

14:19.603 --> 14:22.237
What I meant was, when
pain migrates, I get concerned.

14:22.239 --> 14:23.639
- Concerned?
- Mm-Hmm.

14:23.641 --> 14:26.041
What is that, doctor for
"give it up, old man."

14:26.043 --> 14:27.643
Not necessarily, but let's get

14:27.645 --> 14:28.977
a C.T. of your shoulders and maybe that'll

14:28.979 --> 14:30.712
provide a translation.

14:30.714 --> 14:32.080
- When?
- Now.

14:32.082 --> 14:34.182
Hank, I've missed half a match already.

14:34.184 --> 14:35.851
- If I miss another one...
- If you don't,

14:35.853 --> 14:38.120
you could do irreparable
damage to your arms.

14:38.122 --> 14:40.689
So you can give up half a match today,

14:40.691 --> 14:43.525
or you can risk giving up polo forever.

14:43.527 --> 14:45.627
Would be harder to play without arms.

14:45.629 --> 14:47.629
Yeah, it would.

14:47.631 --> 14:49.865
Hank!

14:49.867 --> 14:51.733
There's been an injury on the field.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.035
- Which team?
- Neither.

14:53.037 --> 14:55.037
- It's a spectator.
- Okay.

14:59.239 --> 15:01.207
Excuse me, excuse me. Hi.

15:01.209 --> 15:02.541
Okay, let me take a look.

15:02.543 --> 15:04.543
- Aah... ow.
- Okay, okay.

15:04.545 --> 15:06.078
I think you've broken your tibia.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.847
Oh, I was... I was running
and my stupid heel

15:07.849 --> 15:09.181
got caught in a divot.

15:09.183 --> 15:11.083
If I didn't love these shoes,
I would hate them.

15:11.085 --> 15:12.285
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.587
Hello.

15:14.589 --> 15:17.123
Oh, it's you.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.758
Yes, it is. Are you okay?

15:18.760 --> 15:21.394
I was... I was trying
to find you... when I fell.

15:21.396 --> 15:23.496
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.797
Well, here I am.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.099
I am Rafa.

15:27.101 --> 15:29.936
And I... I... I am Fannie.

15:29.938 --> 15:31.437
And I am Hank.

15:31.439 --> 15:34.607
Uh, Fannie, I'm gonna use these
to splint your leg.

15:34.609 --> 15:36.042
Fannie?

15:36.044 --> 15:38.177
I should bring you along for
when I run out of painkillers.

15:38.179 --> 15:39.745
I'd be honored.

15:39.747 --> 15:42.248
So, Fannie, may I ask you
why you were looking for me?

15:42.250 --> 15:44.450
Oh, well, I own a small clothing line.

15:44.452 --> 15:45.685
It's called Fancied Pants.

15:45.687 --> 15:47.720
It's high-end performance underwear,

15:47.722 --> 15:50.990
and I think you would be a perfect model.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.625
Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

15:52.627 --> 15:53.926
But first, your leg.

15:53.928 --> 15:55.261
Oh, oh.

15:55.263 --> 15:57.029
We should take you to the hospital.

15:57.031 --> 15:59.298
I'll get you a stretcher. No, no. No need.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.833
- I'll be her stretcher.
- Uh, no.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.802
Be careful.
The leg needs to be stabilized.

16:02.804 --> 16:05.237
Or I guess I could stabilize it.

16:05.239 --> 16:07.506
Excuse us. Sorry.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.641
- Rafa! Rafa! Rafa!
- You're the doctor.

16:08.643 --> 16:10.409
They should be chanting
your name, not mine.

16:10.411 --> 16:11.978
Uh, that's very kind of you,
but in fairness,

16:11.980 --> 16:13.612
it's sorta hard to chant
one-syllable names.

16:13.614 --> 16:14.747
Touche.

16:14.749 --> 16:16.115
Also, they do not know your name.

16:16.117 --> 16:17.383
They do not.

16:17.385 --> 16:21.420
So tell me about your undergarments.

16:21.422 --> 16:22.521
I'd rather show you.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.623
Uh, we should put this on hold

16:24.625 --> 16:26.759
until we're off the field.

16:51.952 --> 16:53.819
Oh, my God.

17:03.163 --> 17:04.997
No.

17:04.999 --> 17:08.733
Oh, God, no.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.202
Uh, excuse me.

17:10.204 --> 17:14.673
Hey, um, so... this is kind of weird.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.675
I'm in a serious bind here.

17:16.676 --> 17:18.743
I'll give you $50
for your pants right now.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.878
- I'll give you $60.
- Sorry.

17:19.881 --> 17:21.480
$75 for your pants.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.922
Pleasure doing business with you.

17:36.696 --> 17:39.932
Oh, jeez.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.802
Eddie, you and I can yammer
till we're blue in the face,

17:42.804 --> 17:45.571
but nothing's gonna get better over there

17:45.573 --> 17:47.773
till the Israelis and the Palestinians

17:47.775 --> 17:49.442
sit across the table and say...

17:49.444 --> 17:51.544
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, darling.

17:51.546 --> 17:53.379
Hi, general.

17:53.381 --> 17:55.681
We can continue this later.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.017
But I like a man who speaks his mind.

17:58.019 --> 18:00.252
- Shows character.
- Thank you.

18:00.254 --> 18:01.754
Sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

18:01.756 --> 18:03.889
Accident on 27, so...

18:03.891 --> 18:05.191
We drove that way.

18:05.193 --> 18:07.693
We didn't see anything.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.428
I mean, I'm not saying
that there was an...

18:09.430 --> 18:11.363
I... I had an accident on... a little one.

18:11.365 --> 18:12.731
It's fine. It's fine.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.700
Oh, that explains the pants.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.872
Yeah. It's a... it's a long story.

18:19.874 --> 18:23.809
I kid. I jest. I digress.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.645
But, truth be known, when he was little,

18:26.647 --> 18:29.548
he had such trouble
controlling his bowels.

18:35.021 --> 18:36.522
Well, now that we're all together,

18:36.524 --> 18:37.790
I would like to make a toast.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.458
You too? All right, you go.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.527
I'll go next.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.095
Don't look so scared, kid.

18:43.097 --> 18:44.563
She already said yes.

18:48.035 --> 18:52.538
I've been married to the love
of my life for 35 years.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.140
And although the road we've traveled

18:54.142 --> 18:57.376
hasn't always been entirely smooth,

18:57.378 --> 19:01.147
there is no one
I'd rather have by my side.

19:01.149 --> 19:04.783
Family is everything.

19:04.785 --> 19:07.052
And so as you begin your
own family, Paige and Evan,

19:07.054 --> 19:11.090
my wish for you is not for a perfect life,

19:11.092 --> 19:13.459
but for a happy one...

19:13.461 --> 19:16.362
knowing that no matter what you face,

19:16.364 --> 19:18.297
you'll always have each other.

19:20.901 --> 19:23.969
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:26.439 --> 19:28.641
Thank you, Mrs. Collins.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.548
Eddie, do you have something
you'd like to say?

19:35.550 --> 19:38.250
Yes.

19:38.252 --> 19:40.853
But what you said was so beautiful,

19:40.855 --> 19:41.954
I couldn't add to it.

19:41.956 --> 19:45.157
Fair enough.

19:45.159 --> 19:46.992
Thank you.

19:55.135 --> 19:56.368
Hello, David.

19:56.370 --> 20:00.139
Divya, I didn't know you were a polo fan.

20:00.141 --> 20:01.507
Well, actually I'm working.

20:01.509 --> 20:03.242
But you probably knew that.

20:03.244 --> 20:07.046
I'm sure that you've seen me here,

20:07.048 --> 20:09.682
like I've seen you here.

20:09.684 --> 20:13.085
Regardless, listen,
I want to explain my behavior.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.486
Your behavior?

20:14.488 --> 20:18.123
The ducking, the hiding, the childishness.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.825
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.194
Please stop being so kind.

20:22.196 --> 20:23.696
You are not making this easy.

20:23.698 --> 20:27.066
Divya, I had a nice time with you.

20:27.068 --> 20:29.335
- Thank you.
- But...

20:29.337 --> 20:32.738
I didn't feel anything.

20:32.740 --> 20:36.175
You didn't?

20:36.177 --> 20:37.509
Oh, wow, you didn't.

20:37.511 --> 20:38.944
I'm sorry.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.113
On paper, you are everything
that I'm looking for.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.648
But, when we went out...

20:42.650 --> 20:46.385
I understand.

20:46.387 --> 20:48.954
- Good luck.
- I'm gonna need it.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.757
But I'm sure someone like you
will have no problem

20:51.759 --> 20:54.560
finding exactly what you're looking for.

21:03.703 --> 21:05.504
Who's the guy?

21:05.506 --> 21:08.274
Someone that I was trying to avoid.

21:08.276 --> 21:12.177
Oh, well, you weren't trying very hard.

21:12.179 --> 21:15.547
His name is David.

21:15.549 --> 21:18.317
We went out on a date.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.486
I thought that he liked me.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.787
I was wrong.

21:21.789 --> 21:24.456
- Do you like him?
- No!

21:24.458 --> 21:26.425
That is not the point.

21:26.427 --> 21:29.261
How could I misread somebody so badly?

21:29.263 --> 21:31.430
Look, it happens.

21:31.432 --> 21:34.233
- Maybe I'm misreading myself.
- That happens too.

21:34.235 --> 21:35.868
And maybe I don't have the ability

21:35.870 --> 21:37.469
to know what I want.

21:37.471 --> 21:39.204
Maybe I'm gonna spend the rest of my life

21:39.206 --> 21:41.974
humiliating myself
in front of very nice men.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.275
That won't happen.

21:43.277 --> 21:46.345
Oh, Hank, there are
7 billion people in this world.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.113
Almost half of them are men.

21:48.115 --> 21:51.116
Statistically speaking,
dating should not be this hard.

21:51.118 --> 21:52.851
It shouldn't.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.653
Look, you know you can
come to be about anything.

21:54.655 --> 21:57.256
Anything, that is, except dating.

21:57.258 --> 22:00.259
Yeah, your track record
is even worse than mine.

22:00.261 --> 22:01.760
And mine is pathetic.

22:01.762 --> 22:03.062
Hey, I said you can come to me,

22:03.064 --> 22:05.531
not you can make fun of me.

22:05.533 --> 22:11.503
You know, maybe if we're
both single at 50...

22:11.505 --> 22:13.906
60.

22:13.908 --> 22:17.810
Maybe 90?

22:17.812 --> 22:19.812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.817
Christmastime has always been very special

22:24.819 --> 22:26.051
for the Collins family.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.853
So I hope there won't be any of this,

22:27.855 --> 22:30.723
"us this year, you next year," business.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.659
Um, I can guarantee you there will not be

22:33.661 --> 22:35.361
any of that, sir.

22:35.363 --> 22:37.629
Daddy, Evan is jewish.

22:37.631 --> 22:39.965
Well, so was Jesus.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.934
But don't think
that gets you out of wearing

22:41.936 --> 22:44.236
one of Ellen's hand-knit reindeer sweaters

22:44.238 --> 22:46.004
for the Christmas card.

22:46.006 --> 22:47.206
'Cause if it did,

22:47.208 --> 22:48.774
I'd have converted years ago.

22:48.776 --> 22:50.142
Daddy!

22:51.779 --> 22:54.646
Honey, did you know that
Eddie's up for an award too?

22:54.648 --> 22:56.181
Yeah, it's very small.

22:56.183 --> 22:58.016
It's for my blog. It's nothing.

22:58.018 --> 23:00.052
You know, my staff keeps saying

23:00.054 --> 23:03.522
I should keep up
with all this computering stuff.

23:03.524 --> 23:05.457
What kind of an award
do they give for a blog?

23:05.459 --> 23:06.825
Uh, who's got room for dessert?

23:06.827 --> 23:09.027
It's called a bloggie.

23:09.029 --> 23:10.329
How long have you been writing it?

23:10.331 --> 23:12.197
Just coffee, maybe, after-dinner drink?

23:12.199 --> 23:13.866
I'm... I'm feeling a little...

23:13.868 --> 23:15.267
- ever since I was in...
- Florida.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.769
You were in Florida. Right, dad?

23:16.771 --> 23:19.338
Florida, a very inspirational
state, Florida.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.206
Florida... that's where
you were incarcerated.

23:21.208 --> 23:24.009
- And that too.
- Yep.

23:24.011 --> 23:27.079
It started off as a way of my reflecting

23:27.081 --> 23:28.414
on the mistakes that I made.

23:28.416 --> 23:30.783
And pretty soon, it became a guide

23:30.785 --> 23:33.485
to helping others to avoid
mistakes of their own.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.487
And I'm very proud to say

23:35.489 --> 23:38.791
that very soon it will be a book.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.293
Well, I admire the way
you've turned your life around

23:41.295 --> 23:45.063
and your willingness to, uh... to share it.

23:45.065 --> 23:46.732
Thank you.

23:46.734 --> 23:49.668
And you know, I could
really share that story

23:49.670 --> 23:53.172
and reach a lot more people
if I was on tour.

23:53.174 --> 23:57.075
So I was thinking, general, do you have...

23:57.077 --> 24:01.213
A warm-up act
for your stump speeches, huh?

24:01.215 --> 24:04.349
Because I would be so happy
to come on down.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.385
I could give them an inspirational spiel,

24:06.387 --> 24:09.588
talk about my book,
and warm the crowd up for you,

24:09.590 --> 24:12.090
then you come out to John Phillip Sousa,

24:12.092 --> 24:15.394
and bing-bang-boom,
we would be off to the races.

24:15.396 --> 24:17.629
I apologize. We have to go.

24:17.631 --> 24:20.833
Paige, would you sign for the meal?

24:20.835 --> 24:22.067
Yeah.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.169
We'll have to do this again really soon.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.038
Bye.

24:38.785 --> 24:42.287
"Bing-bang-boom," dad?

24:42.289 --> 24:43.889
- Are you nuts?
- What?

24:43.891 --> 24:45.457
I thought it was a great idea.

24:45.459 --> 24:48.193
You put him on the spot just now.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.762
You made him so uncomfortable
he got up and left.

24:50.764 --> 24:53.098
Evan, they are traveling tonight.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.067
Maybe they just were anxious to get going.

24:55.069 --> 24:56.635
Why didn't they just say that then?

24:56.637 --> 24:59.671
Well...

24:59.673 --> 25:01.306
all I needed was one night from you...

25:01.308 --> 25:03.942
one night for you to put
me first instead of yourself.

25:03.944 --> 25:06.778
You couldn't even do it.
You couldn't even for one night,

25:06.780 --> 25:09.281
because all you care about is yourself.

25:10.917 --> 25:13.185
Evan.

25:13.187 --> 25:16.188
Evan.

25:28.578 --> 25:30.179
Good morning.

25:30.181 --> 25:31.447
Hi. Good morning.

25:31.449 --> 25:33.382
- You got up early.
- Yes, yeah.

25:33.384 --> 25:36.652
I couldn't sleep, so, uh...

25:36.654 --> 25:39.188
hey, you feel like some frozen yogurt?

25:39.190 --> 25:41.157
It's 7:30 in the morning.

25:41.159 --> 25:42.992
Yeah, uh, scoop du jour opens at 8:00.

25:42.994 --> 25:45.828
So why don't you go and get one
of your favorite things?

25:45.830 --> 25:47.496
You know, the Oreo Reese's swirl.

25:47.498 --> 25:49.665
I don't want frozen yogurt.

25:49.667 --> 25:50.966
And while you're there,
would you mind popping

25:50.968 --> 25:52.301
into the little stationery store next door

25:52.303 --> 25:54.804
and getting me a ream of paper,
some nice thick stock?

25:54.806 --> 25:56.172
Not so thick it won't go
through the printer.

25:56.174 --> 25:57.540
But, you know, just nice.

25:57.542 --> 26:00.843
Okay. What are you talking about?

26:00.845 --> 26:05.114
I am writing your father
an apology letter.

26:05.116 --> 26:07.116
You have nothing to apologize for.

26:07.118 --> 26:08.317
From my father.

26:08.319 --> 26:09.785
It's harder than you think too.

26:09.787 --> 26:11.887
My... my dad doesn't
talk like normal people, so...

26:11.889 --> 26:14.723
Evan, my father did not
leave the restaurant

26:14.725 --> 26:16.425
- because of your dad.
- Right.

26:16.427 --> 26:18.194
He just made an incredibly inappropriate

26:18.196 --> 26:21.030
and opportunistic offer,
and your father, uh,

26:21.032 --> 26:22.465
instantly got up and left.

26:22.467 --> 26:24.133
I'm sure the two have nothing
to do with each other.

26:24.135 --> 26:26.402
Is that my cell?

26:26.404 --> 26:27.937
Yeah, it's been ringing all morning.

26:27.939 --> 26:29.605
It's killing me, in fact.

26:32.075 --> 26:33.509
Whoa.

26:33.511 --> 26:37.012
I have a dozen texts
from friends and relatives.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.448
And my dad's called six times.

26:39.450 --> 26:41.617
Yeah, he wants you
to call off the wedding.

26:41.619 --> 26:42.885
I'm sure of it.

26:42.887 --> 26:45.354
Okay, um, call him now.

26:45.356 --> 26:48.958
Yeah, I need to know how much
damage I have to control.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.159
No, you know, no, no.

26:50.161 --> 26:51.460
Help me with this letter first.

26:51.462 --> 26:53.562
Maybe if I can send him
an email before you two talk...

26:53.564 --> 26:55.064
staying one step ahead of the game.

26:55.066 --> 26:56.398
As a military man, he'll respect that.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.733
So listen, Paige, okay? Listen.

26:57.735 --> 26:59.902
- "Dear, general... "
- That's strange.

26:59.904 --> 27:01.770
Is it? Is "dear, sir," better?

27:01.772 --> 27:04.206
- I've been going back and forth.
- No.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.842
This text.

27:06.844 --> 27:09.245
What?

27:09.247 --> 27:12.081
From some political blogger.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.149
How did they get your number?

27:13.151 --> 27:14.483
I have no idea.

27:14.485 --> 27:16.919
- Is that your dad?
- Mm-Hmm.

27:16.921 --> 27:19.221
30 years ago.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.157
Whoa. Who's that?

27:21.159 --> 27:23.792
Not my mother.

27:23.794 --> 27:25.528
This blogger is saying that this woman

27:25.530 --> 27:27.096
was my dad's assistant.

27:27.098 --> 27:28.697
But clearly he's implying
their relationship

27:28.699 --> 27:31.500
went beyond military business.

27:31.502 --> 27:34.403
Well, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

27:34.405 --> 27:37.173
Yeah, me too. I just...

27:37.175 --> 27:39.108
gotta figure out what it is.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.110
Yeah.

27:58.261 --> 28:00.029
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:00.031 --> 28:01.931
Doctor coming through. Thank you.

28:01.933 --> 28:05.167
Fannie, you shouldn't be back here.

28:05.169 --> 28:06.702
She's tachycardic at 120.

28:06.704 --> 28:07.937
Her lips are turning blue.

28:07.939 --> 28:09.705
- She's becoming hypoxic.
- Okay.

28:09.707 --> 28:11.106
Hold this. Turn it on.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.608
Here's some oxygen, Fannie.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.177
Good.

28:15.179 --> 28:19.081
Okay, we're just gonna give you a listen.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.249
Divya.

28:20.251 --> 28:22.384
- I'll get I.V. steroids.
- Good.

28:22.386 --> 28:23.953
What's happening to me?

28:23.955 --> 28:26.188
Those spots on your neck,
your difficulty breathing,

28:26.190 --> 28:27.690
I think when you broke your leg,

28:27.692 --> 28:29.725
fat droplets escaped
from inside your bones

28:29.727 --> 28:31.427
and collected in your bloodstream.

28:31.429 --> 28:32.595
If I'm right, it's blocking oxygen

28:32.597 --> 28:33.996
from getting into your lungs.

28:33.998 --> 28:36.131
I knew I shouldn't have come
today, but I had to.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.033
I've worked so hard for this.

28:38.035 --> 28:39.835
I made my pitch, and I'm so close

28:39.837 --> 28:41.770
to getting Rafa to sign.

28:41.772 --> 28:43.205
I need... I need to be okay.

28:43.207 --> 28:44.873
I can't make any guarantees, but the fact

28:44.875 --> 28:46.842
that you're still breathing,
conscious, and rational

28:46.844 --> 28:48.744
makes me think your chances
of a recovery are good.

28:51.881 --> 28:53.349
Fannie?

28:55.852 --> 28:57.152
Hey, Rafa.

28:57.154 --> 28:59.021
Take this.

28:59.023 --> 29:00.556
It has always brought me good luck.

29:00.558 --> 29:02.791
I don't need luck, Rafa.

29:02.793 --> 29:04.393
I need you to say yes.

29:04.395 --> 29:07.363
Please get well.

29:14.471 --> 29:15.804
Hey.

29:15.806 --> 29:17.172
What'd they say?

29:17.174 --> 29:19.141
We keep missing each other.

29:19.143 --> 29:20.576
They're on a plane now from Albany,

29:20.578 --> 29:22.578
but my mom texted saying that they want

29:22.580 --> 29:24.213
to talk in person
and that I shouldn't believe

29:24.215 --> 29:25.481
everything I hear.

29:25.483 --> 29:28.017
Yeah, I bet the worst is over, you know?

29:28.019 --> 29:30.052
Well, no, because my cousin texted

29:30.054 --> 29:32.087
saying that I need
to turn on the TV, comment,

29:32.089 --> 29:33.722
get ahead of the story...
Sharon Reeves, seen here

29:33.724 --> 29:35.424
outside a motel
in Boonesville, Missouri...

29:35.426 --> 29:36.759
Before it gets bigger.

29:36.761 --> 29:39.194
A city which has no local military base.

29:39.196 --> 29:41.397
One week after this photo was taken,

29:41.399 --> 29:43.465
miss Reeves died in a single-car accident

29:43.467 --> 29:46.735
in a vehicle registered
to general Collins.

29:46.737 --> 29:48.837
But according to a military spokesman,

29:48.839 --> 29:51.340
there was never
any official investigation.

29:51.342 --> 29:53.042
People are asking questions,

29:53.044 --> 29:55.044
but general Collins, currently leading

29:55.046 --> 29:57.313
by two points in the New York Senate Race,

29:57.315 --> 29:59.148
isn't providing any answers.

29:59.150 --> 30:00.816
General, general, one question, please.

30:02.186 --> 30:03.552
Got nothing for you today,

30:03.554 --> 30:04.753
- maybe tomorrow.
- Come on.

30:04.755 --> 30:05.921
You said you were gonna
answer my questions.

30:05.923 --> 30:07.156
No. Thanks a lot.

30:07.158 --> 30:08.557
Good to see y'all. Thank you.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.059
General, one question.

30:10.061 --> 30:11.560
Did you sleep with your assistant, sir?

30:11.562 --> 30:12.661
Was she underage?

30:12.663 --> 30:13.829
Did you sleep with your assistant?

30:13.831 --> 30:16.131
All right. Y'all have a good day.

30:18.836 --> 30:21.937
They didn't leave the
restaurant because of your dad.

30:21.939 --> 30:25.874
They left because of this.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.776
Baby.

30:32.349 --> 30:33.982
Come on, Braddock.

30:39.789 --> 30:41.290
Go, Braddock.

30:41.292 --> 30:42.858
- Aah!
- Simon?

30:44.762 --> 30:46.795
Are you all right?

30:46.797 --> 30:49.131
Johnny, get the horses.

30:49.133 --> 30:50.132
My arm.

30:50.134 --> 30:53.535
It's my arm.

30:53.537 --> 30:55.971
- Simon!
- Are you okay?

30:55.973 --> 30:59.441
Has your arm gotten worse?

30:59.443 --> 31:00.709
It's paralyzed.

31:05.867 --> 31:07.835
Didn't you say my C.T. was clean?

31:07.837 --> 31:09.370
What's happening to him?

31:09.372 --> 31:10.671
I don't know yet.

31:10.673 --> 31:12.373
But I do know this isn't a polo injury.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.575
Then what is it?

31:14.577 --> 31:16.510
I've had a pain in my arm

31:16.512 --> 31:18.979
for a while now, Rafa, a sharp pain.

31:18.981 --> 31:21.148
But I've been keeping it to myself.

31:21.150 --> 31:22.716
Why would you do that?

31:22.718 --> 31:24.418
To show that I deserve to be on this team.

31:24.420 --> 31:25.919
But the truth is, I'm getting old

31:25.921 --> 31:28.422
and I can't keep up with you guys anymore.

31:28.424 --> 31:29.957
Go ahead, Hank.

31:29.959 --> 31:31.558
All right, we need to get you
to the hospital

31:31.560 --> 31:32.926
for a neck and spine M.R.I.

31:32.928 --> 31:35.362
before this paralysis progresses further.

31:35.364 --> 31:37.998
Shoulda stopped playing
like you told me to,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.933
- but I just couldn't.
- Come on.

31:39.935 --> 31:41.235
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- No.

31:41.237 --> 31:42.770
- Yes, I'm coming with you.
- You stay here

31:42.772 --> 31:44.471
- and win the match.
- The match doesn't matter.

31:44.473 --> 31:45.973
I'm not asking you as your teammate.

31:45.975 --> 31:48.942
I'm telling you as your boss.

31:56.451 --> 31:58.452
I don't know why I was so stubborn,

31:58.454 --> 32:00.020
why it mattered to me so much.

32:00.022 --> 32:02.656
Well, you love the game.

32:02.658 --> 32:05.659
More than anything, so I thought.

32:14.135 --> 32:16.070
We'll know more
when the M.R.I. comes back,

32:16.072 --> 32:17.271
which should be any minute.

32:17.273 --> 32:18.505
So how did my team do?

32:18.507 --> 32:20.107
I left before the match was over.

32:20.109 --> 32:22.042
What? Why would you do that?

32:22.044 --> 32:24.411
To come here.

32:24.413 --> 32:25.412
Oh, right. Sorry.

32:25.414 --> 32:27.948
It's okay.

32:27.950 --> 32:29.249
You won?

32:29.251 --> 32:30.617
Yes, we won.

32:30.619 --> 32:31.752
Congratulations.

32:31.754 --> 32:32.753
Without me?

32:32.755 --> 32:34.888
For you.

32:34.890 --> 32:36.090
We wouldn't be a team without you.

32:36.092 --> 32:37.091
You put us together.

32:40.562 --> 32:43.230
Hey, listen, you...

32:43.232 --> 32:46.400
you've been like a father figure to me,

32:46.402 --> 32:48.702
the only one I've ever really had.

32:50.772 --> 32:52.406
Well, thank you, Rafa.

32:52.408 --> 32:56.043
You have no idea
how much that means to me.

33:01.449 --> 33:03.650
- Just one thing.
- You name it.

33:03.652 --> 33:05.619
How about instead of a father figure,

33:05.621 --> 33:08.856
you think of me more like
an older brother figure?

33:08.858 --> 33:10.958
Slightly older.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.961
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:17.532 --> 33:19.099
Try that again, Simon.

33:23.906 --> 33:25.906
Well, I am trying,
but it's usually not this hard.

33:25.908 --> 33:27.274
What does that mean?

33:27.276 --> 33:28.842
Ironically, it means that even though

33:28.844 --> 33:31.712
you can't show me you're okay,
you will be.

33:31.714 --> 33:33.380
If I'm right, you have something called

33:33.382 --> 33:36.116
Parsonage-Turner syndrome,
an inflammatory reaction

33:36.118 --> 33:38.385
against the nerves
that run through your underarm.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.420
- It is permanent?
- No.

33:40.422 --> 33:42.689
With oral steroids and physical therapy,

33:42.691 --> 33:44.391
you have an excellent chance
at a complete recovery.

33:44.393 --> 33:46.226
So no more polo?

33:46.228 --> 33:47.795
Not for a while.

33:47.797 --> 33:48.896
And this time, you're gonna
have to be patient.

33:48.898 --> 33:50.864
- I'll make sure of it.
- Good.

33:50.866 --> 33:52.800
Okay.

33:52.802 --> 33:55.002
- Thanks, doc.
- You got it.

33:55.004 --> 33:56.036
Be right back.

33:56.038 --> 33:57.437
Hank, um, is now a good time?

33:57.439 --> 33:58.839
- Uh, let me go check.
- Okay.

33:58.841 --> 34:00.207
Looking good.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.942
Fannie, you really dodged a bullet here.

34:01.944 --> 34:04.011
I mean, an embolism
can be a very serious thing.

34:04.013 --> 34:06.213
But I think 'cause
you're in such good health,

34:06.215 --> 34:07.748
you pulled through like a champ.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.483
Well, I was just lucky you were there.

34:09.485 --> 34:11.851
Thank you.

34:11.853 --> 34:14.121
Okay, I'm gonna send him in, if it's okay.

34:14.123 --> 34:17.658
Yes.

34:17.659 --> 34:20.494
Okay, so Fannie's stable, but tired.

34:20.496 --> 34:22.496
- So no more than five minutes.
- Okay.

34:22.498 --> 34:25.465
- Thank you.
- Okay. Yeah.

34:27.036 --> 34:29.703
I heard you won.

34:29.705 --> 34:31.338
Yes, we're champions.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.005
Are you in?

34:33.007 --> 34:34.241
Yes, I am.

34:34.243 --> 34:35.676
I'm so happy.

34:35.678 --> 34:36.743
We're gonna have a marvelous time.

34:36.745 --> 34:38.178
- Mwah.
- I hope so.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.280
And business is going to boom.

34:40.282 --> 34:42.248
That sounds good too.

34:42.251 --> 34:44.484
This just in.

34:44.485 --> 34:45.652
One would think that...

34:45.654 --> 34:46.853
you gotta stop watching it.

34:46.856 --> 34:48.422
I can't.

34:48.424 --> 34:50.357
Baby, it's just making it worse.

34:50.359 --> 34:53.460
It can't get any worse.

34:53.462 --> 34:55.896
Hi, kids.

34:55.898 --> 34:57.531
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought,

34:57.533 --> 34:59.766
hey, you guys needs to comfort food.

34:59.768 --> 35:04.338
And I heard you like red wine risotto.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.706
Thanks.

35:05.708 --> 35:08.008
I'm really not very hungry.

35:08.010 --> 35:09.943
Yeah. You know what I think?

35:09.945 --> 35:11.278
I think that these people

35:11.280 --> 35:13.080
make up those stories all the time.

35:13.082 --> 35:15.315
And I think the more salacious,
the better,

35:15.317 --> 35:17.484
you know, to keep the viewers going.

35:17.486 --> 35:20.721
You have to listen to, believe in,

35:20.723 --> 35:24.391
and trust your parents
right now, that's all.

35:24.393 --> 35:25.893
You're right.

35:25.895 --> 35:30.364
I know for a fact he would
never cover up a death.

35:30.366 --> 35:32.065
He's just not that kind of man.

35:32.067 --> 35:34.134
He's not.

35:34.136 --> 35:36.570
All right. Come on.

35:36.572 --> 35:40.774
So that is what you
have to hold on to right now.

35:40.776 --> 35:45.312
And never forget
that your parents love you.

35:45.314 --> 35:47.014
You know who else loves you?

35:47.016 --> 35:48.615
The Lawsons.

35:48.617 --> 35:50.217
And you know why?

35:50.219 --> 35:51.518
Because you're family.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.554
Right?

35:54.556 --> 35:57.157
Thank you, Eddie.

35:57.159 --> 36:01.061
I see where Evan gets his big heart.

36:01.063 --> 36:04.698
All right.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.934
Hey, dad?

36:06.936 --> 36:10.137
I'm sorry for last night.

36:10.139 --> 36:13.240
You know, I'm... I'm...

36:13.242 --> 36:15.642
I can't believe I said those things.

36:15.644 --> 36:19.346
And the man that you are...

36:21.649 --> 36:23.417
It's not who I saw yesterday, you know?

36:23.419 --> 36:25.752
You're... you're so much more than that.

36:25.754 --> 36:27.955
And I'm...

36:27.957 --> 36:30.424
Not another word.

36:30.426 --> 36:32.559
Because you and I are gonna take care

36:32.561 --> 36:36.430
of this wonderful woman.

36:36.432 --> 36:40.033
Because we're gonna have
some red wine risotto.

36:40.035 --> 36:41.368
And then you're gonna
have some red wine risotto.

36:41.370 --> 36:42.669
That's a lot of red wine risotto.

36:42.671 --> 36:44.638
I'm gonna have some red wine risotto.

37:04.427 --> 37:06.695
You remove the polo wraps yourself?

37:06.697 --> 37:08.329
Yes.

37:08.331 --> 37:09.731
And I put them on.

37:09.733 --> 37:13.001
I don't like anyone else doing it.

37:13.003 --> 37:16.171
You check the tendons?

37:16.173 --> 37:17.872
You know about horses?

37:17.874 --> 37:22.043
Yeah, I... I love horses, always have.

37:22.045 --> 37:25.613
Horses are easy to love.

37:25.615 --> 37:26.948
When I was a child,

37:26.950 --> 37:29.851
I had an endlessly tolerant pony
named Elmer.

37:29.853 --> 37:32.020
And then on my tenth birthday,

37:32.022 --> 37:36.191
I started riding a half-arab,
half-quarter horse.

37:36.193 --> 37:39.961
Ajax... named after the Greek hero,

37:39.963 --> 37:41.529
not the cleaning product.

37:41.531 --> 37:45.800
Well, he sounds like he was a brave horse.

37:45.802 --> 37:48.470
The only thing brave
about that horse was his name.

37:48.472 --> 37:50.839
One day I was riding and he decided

37:50.841 --> 37:53.608
to gallop towards a fence.

37:53.610 --> 37:55.977
And then he threw me off.

37:55.979 --> 37:57.812
But you know the old saying.

37:57.814 --> 38:00.148
So I got right back on the horse,

38:00.150 --> 38:02.117
and he threw me off again.

38:02.119 --> 38:04.786
That was the last time I rode Ajax.

38:06.490 --> 38:09.991
I think he just didn't know how to trust.

38:09.993 --> 38:12.927
Yeah, I guess he didn't.

38:12.929 --> 38:15.930
Horses are like people that way.

38:19.301 --> 38:20.802
But you kept riding, right?

38:20.804 --> 38:23.805
I did.

38:23.807 --> 38:25.840
I guess sometimes I feel more myself

38:25.842 --> 38:28.209
around horses than I do people.

38:28.211 --> 38:30.812
That's why I'm here.

38:33.650 --> 38:37.118
That means to escape everything,

38:37.120 --> 38:39.954
to be alone, but not alone.

38:41.824 --> 38:44.626
I love that feeling.

38:44.628 --> 38:46.761
You know, you and I have a lot in common.

38:46.763 --> 38:49.230
That would surprise me.

38:49.232 --> 38:50.799
What if I can prove it to you?

38:50.801 --> 38:51.966
All right, well, how are you gonna...

39:01.110 --> 39:03.478
Am I interrupting the creative process?

39:03.480 --> 39:07.615
You never interrupt anything.

39:07.617 --> 39:09.117
But why are you here?

39:09.119 --> 39:10.018
Something happened.
Somebody said something.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.219
Okay, it's the general.

39:11.221 --> 39:13.221
No, Evan. Evan said something.

39:13.223 --> 39:15.190
Everything is fine.

39:15.192 --> 39:16.324
Evan's fine.

39:16.326 --> 39:18.860
Nothing new to report.

39:18.862 --> 39:20.128
Although Evan told me all about

39:20.130 --> 39:21.462
the <i>meet the parents</i> dinner.

39:21.464 --> 39:23.298
It was charming and delicious.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.333
Those were not exactly
the words Evan used.

39:25.335 --> 39:28.403
You know that that boy
can be over-dramatic sometimes.

39:28.405 --> 39:32.140
He also said how amazing
you were with Paige.

39:32.142 --> 39:34.075
I only did what a father

39:34.077 --> 39:36.044
or a future father-in-law would do.

39:36.046 --> 39:37.745
Nothing more, nothing less.

39:37.747 --> 39:39.414
- Humility.
- Hm.

39:39.416 --> 39:40.982
I didn't know you had it in you.

39:40.984 --> 39:43.184
Yeah, you know that
story about the old dog?

39:43.186 --> 39:44.652
It isn't true.

39:44.654 --> 39:45.954
Not a day goes by when I don't feel

39:45.956 --> 39:47.288
like I'm changing.

39:47.290 --> 39:50.792
Yeah, for the better.

39:50.794 --> 39:53.061
I'll drink to that.

39:56.465 --> 39:59.868
- Mm. And to Evan.
- Mm.

39:59.870 --> 40:01.069
My youngest is getting married.

40:01.071 --> 40:02.937
I am so proud of him...

40:02.939 --> 40:04.572
and a little surprised.

40:04.574 --> 40:06.608
I mean, easy money had you walking down

40:06.610 --> 40:07.942
that aisle first, you know?

40:07.944 --> 40:09.811
Yeah, I guess it's not so easy.

40:09.813 --> 40:13.248
How is it possible that my firstborn,

40:13.250 --> 40:17.852
the doctor, can't find a good match?

40:17.854 --> 40:19.787
I've found some, but for some reason,

40:19.789 --> 40:21.956
I just can't seem to hang on to them.

40:21.958 --> 40:24.192
First, a failed engagement,

40:24.194 --> 40:25.593
then I thought Jill was the one.

40:25.595 --> 40:27.629
- Yeah, so did I.
- Yeah.

40:27.631 --> 40:29.797
And recently, there was this woman,

40:29.799 --> 40:32.800
but I kinda messed that up.

40:32.802 --> 40:33.968
Maybe I'm just not built for it.

40:33.970 --> 40:35.870
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

40:35.872 --> 40:40.675
You, Hank Lawson, are built
for anything you want.

40:40.677 --> 40:44.679
Hank, I am not worried about you.

40:49.518 --> 40:50.885
I can't believe I'm saying it,

40:50.887 --> 40:54.989
but I'm not worried about you either.

40:54.991 --> 40:58.293
Let's drink to that too.

41:10.539 --> 41:12.974
Did you ever feel like

41:12.976 --> 41:15.576
you didn't know who you could trust,

41:15.578 --> 41:19.580
or who you are?

41:22.084 --> 41:24.319
- You talked to him?
- I did.

41:24.321 --> 41:27.822
What'd he say?

41:27.824 --> 41:32.694
He admitted... that he did go to Missouri

41:32.696 --> 41:34.262
with his assistant Sharon.

41:35.899 --> 41:39.267
And they were not there on army business.

41:39.269 --> 41:43.538
They did stay in that motel
for a couple of days.

41:43.540 --> 41:49.010
And she did die in a car wreck in his car.

41:50.479 --> 41:52.847
They wanted to keep it quiet.

41:54.616 --> 41:56.050
I'm sorry.

41:56.052 --> 41:57.552
He wasn't having an affair.

41:57.554 --> 41:59.387
What?

41:59.389 --> 42:03.391
Turns out, she had
taken him there to join my mom,

42:03.393 --> 42:07.095
because she was helping my parents...

42:07.097 --> 42:10.064
with my adoption.

42:10.066 --> 42:13.267
I didn't know you were adopted.

42:13.269 --> 42:16.270
Neither did I.
