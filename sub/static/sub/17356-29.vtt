00:07.274 --> 00:09.842
- ¶

00:09.844 --> 00:12.978
- Happy Z Force
Announcement Day!

00:12.980 --> 00:14.013
- Hey, Cherry.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.047
- Did President Kickbutt

00:15.049 --> 00:16.348
call yet to tell
you if you got in?

00:16.350 --> 00:19.184
Because if you didn't,
this balloon is reversible.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.187
- No, Cherry, we're
waiting to find out

00:22.189 --> 00:23.622
if we made
the Championships.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.958
If we win, then
we make the Z Force.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.327
- Why hasn't
Kickbutt called?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.095
What if we filled
out the forms wrong?

00:30.097 --> 00:31.230
What if they lost
the forms?

00:31.232 --> 00:34.133
What if they
never got the forms?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.368
- Stop saying "forms."

00:36.370 --> 00:37.636
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.239
I should just try to stop
thinking about the Z Force

00:40.241 --> 00:42.007
or anything Z related.
- Yeah.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.542
- Let's go to the zoo!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.411
- They just got a zebra!

00:45.413 --> 00:46.912
- It's from Zimbabwe!

00:46.914 --> 00:49.114
- Oh, I get it,
you're mocking me...

00:49.116 --> 00:51.583
while I'm falling apart!
[sobbing]

00:53.187 --> 00:54.586
- I broke my zipper.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.321
- Ha! Good one, Hank.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.456
Oh, you're not kidding.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.358
- FEMALE ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

00:59.360 --> 01:02.594
Incoming call from
Super President Kickbutt.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.196
- Hello, Thundermans.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.198
I have bad news.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.066
- We didn't make it?

01:07.068 --> 01:09.468
- No, I just
spilled my latte.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.304
And now onto
the good news.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.339
Another latte
is on the way.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.375
- So, just tell
us the news!

01:17.478 --> 01:18.077
- Okay.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.413
Max and Phoebe, you're in
the Z Force Championships.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.514
- ALL:
[cheering]

01:22.516 --> 01:24.116
- HANK:
Congratulations!

01:24.118 --> 01:24.817
- We did it, Phoebe.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.619
- Oh, I knew I filled
out those forms right.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.988
- ¶

01:29.990 --> 01:31.090
- BARB:
Awwww...

01:31.092 --> 01:32.357
- HANK: Can you
believe it, Barb?

01:32.359 --> 01:34.526
Our kids are this close
to joining the Z Force.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.628
- It seems like just
yesterday we moved here,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.964
so, they could have
normal childhoods.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.466
- I thought it was
'cause you guys

01:40.468 --> 01:42.167
couldn't fit into
your supersuits anymore.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.536
- No. It was so you
could go to school,

01:44.538 --> 01:48.073
and make friends and appreciate
the importance of family.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.642
- That's right. Even
the coolest job in the world

01:50.644 --> 01:52.711
isn't more important
than your family.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.080
Promise me you'll
remember that.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.515
- I promise.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.116
- Max?

01:57.118 --> 02:00.419
- Hm? Oh, right--important,
family, I'm coolest.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.987
Got it.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.024
- Ooh, the Z Force sent
beams to pick you up.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.626
Fancy.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.228
- Bye, guys.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.997
- Bye! Good luck!
- We love you!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.266
You know,
that wasn't so bad.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.968
I thought I would cry.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.569
- Me, too.
[sobbing]

02:17.571 --> 02:20.205
Don't look
at me, kids!

02:22.176 --> 02:24.009
- Billy, this
is our big chance.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.744
- To make fun
of dad for crying?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.613
Way ahead of you.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.514
- No.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.481
With Max and Phoebe gone,

02:29.483 --> 02:32.084
we can finally be the new
protectors of Hiddenville.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.285
Laser Girl and...

02:33.287 --> 02:35.554
MC Runs-a-lot.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.756
No? I'll work
on it later.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.025
But now I'm gonna go
put on my supersuit.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.461
[zooming]
- [leaves scattering]

02:42.463 --> 02:44.296
- [zooming]

02:44.665 --> 02:46.698
- That's my supersuit.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.168
- Cool! You have
a fart shield.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.036
- Take it off!

02:51.438 --> 02:54.239
- ¶

02:57.344 --> 03:00.012
- Okay, teleporting
is awesome!

03:01.315 --> 03:02.381
- Now look
around, Phoebe.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.283
Everyone in this room
is the enemy.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.117
- Come on, Max.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.152
Just 'cause we're all
competing for the same spot

03:07.154 --> 03:08.387
doesn't mean
we can't be friendly.

03:08.389 --> 03:12.090
- [titanium hand whirring]
- Hey, cool titanium hand.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.659
I'm Phoebe.
This is my brother, Max.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.328
We're competing for
the same spot.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.329
Oh!

03:17.331 --> 03:18.697
- Your skin is soft.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.733
Tearing it from
the bones will be easy.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.501
- Phoebe, come quick!

03:22.503 --> 03:24.469
[laughs] That's my
brother calling me.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.071
I gotta go. Bye.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.341
- [dramatic music]

03:29.343 --> 03:30.242
- Good news.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.345
You can all
join the Z Force...

03:33.347 --> 03:36.114
is something
I will never say.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.816
I am Commander Dirk Trumbo.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.717
You are competing
for a spot

03:38.719 --> 03:41.420
on the most elite squad
of superheroes in the world.

03:41.422 --> 03:46.425
If you win, you get to work for
the greatest hero of them all--

03:46.427 --> 03:49.628
me, Commander Dirk Trumbo.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.364
The test may begin
at any moment.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.132
- Any moment?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.769
Max, we should be prepared
for anything, like...

03:57.771 --> 03:59.438
- The room filling
with gas?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.138
- [gas hissing]

04:00.140 --> 04:02.674
- I guess so. There are
a lot of boys in here.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.709
- [hissing continues]

04:03.711 --> 04:06.311
- The room
is filling with gas!

04:06.313 --> 04:10.515
- ALL:
[coughing]

04:10.517 --> 04:12.551
- ¶

04:12.553 --> 04:13.652
¶ What you see ¶

04:13.654 --> 04:14.853
¶ Is not what you get ¶

04:14.855 --> 04:18.523
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

04:18.525 --> 04:20.192
¶ We fit right in ¶

04:20.194 --> 04:21.393
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

04:21.395 --> 04:23.161
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

04:23.163 --> 04:24.663
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

04:24.665 --> 04:26.598
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

04:26.600 --> 04:28.500
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

04:28.502 --> 04:30.135
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

04:30.137 --> 04:31.536
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

04:31.538 --> 04:33.405
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

04:33.407 --> 04:34.840
¶ It's our reality ¶

04:34.842 --> 04:36.141
¶ Just your average family ¶

04:36.143 --> 04:39.611
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

04:39.613 --> 04:43.682
¶ Livin' a double life ¶

04:45.886 --> 04:48.420
- ALL:
[coughing continues]

04:50.858 --> 04:53.392
- This is a test to
see who can escape.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.626
We're gonna pass.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.695
[breathing frosty air]

04:57.865 --> 05:00.732
Or pass out,
'cause that didn't work.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.700
- BOTH:
[coughing]

05:01.702 --> 05:04.469
- It must be that chromium gas.
Very explosive.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.673
Maybe we can use it
to blast our way out.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.874
- Good idea, swooshy hair.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.343
Now idea belong
to Galaxia.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.245
- [dramatic music]

05:13.247 --> 05:15.647
- ALL:
[coughing continues]

05:15.649 --> 05:17.749
- [inhaling]

05:21.355 --> 05:23.488
[exhaling]

05:23.490 --> 05:25.223
- [dramatic music]

05:25.225 --> 05:27.192
- [explosion]

05:30.597 --> 05:31.830
- Nice work, Galaxia!

05:31.832 --> 05:33.632
You remind me
of a young me--

05:33.634 --> 05:35.334
except I was a boy.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.736
Okay, time for
refreshments.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.539
- I can't believe it.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.275
That gas bag stole our idea
and is already winning.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.309
- You're right.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.411
I should give her
my phone number.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.381
- Right this way,

05:49.383 --> 05:52.751
to the nicest room any of
you have ever been in.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.690
- I wonder if
it's another test.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.926
- Ya!
- [tray clatters]

06:00.928 --> 06:04.396
- Way to save us
from egg rolls, Amazium.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.365
You're outta here!

06:06.934 --> 06:09.401
Well, guess we'll move
on to the good stuff.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.737
Waiter, bring
the pizza bagels.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.775
- Mmm, finger foods
and poison gas.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.276
- Right, just like
mom used to make.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.512
- PHOEBE: [laughing]
- [high-pitched laughter]

06:20.514 --> 06:23.415
- Is this what
nerd flirting looks like?

06:23.417 --> 06:24.483
- You are a ham.
I'm Phoebe.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.717
- I'm Balfour.
- And we're all toast,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.387
if we don't figure out
how to get rid of Galaxia.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.688
- Oh, dude,
she's so scary.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.022
You know, if you wanna
knock her out,

06:31.024 --> 06:32.824
you could form an alliance
with a certain

06:32.826 --> 06:35.427
smart and, uh,
powerful superhero.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.462
- You have spinach
in your teeth.

06:37.464 --> 06:38.830
- Awww...

06:39.299 --> 06:40.866
- And why would
we team up with you?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.335
What's your power?
Super math tutoring?

06:43.337 --> 06:44.870
[laughing]

06:44.872 --> 06:46.705
- They call me...

06:46.707 --> 06:47.406
The Gamer.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.441
I can fire a nanochip
onto a person's neck,

06:49.443 --> 06:52.611
then control
their every movement.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.612
Watch.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.713
- [blaster firing]

06:54.715 --> 06:55.781
- [electronic bleep]

06:55.783 --> 06:58.617
- What is happening?

07:00.354 --> 07:02.354
- Oh, my new friends
were hungry.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.323
Now pirouette away,
my good sir.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.992
- [electronic bleep]

07:07.327 --> 07:10.028
- [high-pitched
laughter]

07:10.030 --> 07:11.329
- Thanks.
We'll call you,

07:11.331 --> 07:14.332
if we ever need
an army of dancing waiters.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.469
- Oh, this must be Max
and Phoebe Thunderman.

07:17.471 --> 07:21.072
I'm looking forward
to seeing your twin power.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.608
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Our what power?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.010
- You know,
the unique power

07:25.012 --> 07:28.780
that all super twins access
in the heat of battle.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.682
Uh, like the Hipster twins.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.418
- BOTH:
Twin power, activate!

07:33.420 --> 07:35.320
[flames roaring]

07:35.923 --> 07:39.024
- Oh, our twin power,
right, of course.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.060
It's something
that we totally have.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.495
- You'd better.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.030
Or Galaxia's gonna
rip off your heads

07:45.032 --> 07:47.632
and plant daisies
down your necks.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.771
- [hand whirring]

07:53.907 --> 07:59.611
- Hey, buddy, tell us
more about this alliance.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.882
- [tablet ringing]
- Billy, come quick!

08:03.884 --> 08:06.618
Phoebe's tablet's
reporting a crime!

08:06.620 --> 08:08.053
- [zooming]

08:09.022 --> 08:09.921
- What's with your hair?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.623
- If I'm taking
over for Max,

08:11.625 --> 08:12.991
I've gotta look
the part.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.926
How's my swoosh?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.428
- [lasers zapping]

08:16.430 --> 08:17.996
- [hair sizzling]

08:19.800 --> 08:21.366
- Smoking.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.936
Now let's go
save the day.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.806
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, you two.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.807
- Where are you going?

08:28.809 --> 08:29.808
- With Max
and Phoebe gone,

08:29.810 --> 08:31.409
Hiddenville
needs protectors.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.677
- And you're
looking at them.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.413
Say hello to
Laser Girl and...

08:35.415 --> 08:36.982
- Speed Bump!

08:37.985 --> 08:39.050
- Anyway...

08:39.052 --> 08:40.385
there's a new
criminal in town

08:40.387 --> 08:41.753
and we're gonna
take him down.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.522
- BARB:
The Bake Sale Bandit?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.624
- He bites muffins and
brownies at bake sales

08:45.626 --> 08:47.158
and runs away
without paying.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.960
- I don't like
someone terrorizing

08:48.962 --> 08:50.495
the dessert community.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.631
This bandit needs
to be caught!

08:52.633 --> 08:53.632
But not by you two.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.967
- Yeah, you guys
aren't ready to fight crime.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.936
- Yes, we are. You guys
have been training us.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.739
- Besides, if we don't
stop the bandit, who will?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.107
- What do you
say, Barb?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.609
Or should I say
Electress?

09:04.611 --> 09:07.612
- Hiddenville does
need new protectors.

09:07.614 --> 09:08.713
- Hello, right here.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.950
- You're right, citizen.
We are here.

09:11.952 --> 09:12.984
- [laughing]

09:12.986 --> 09:14.553
She's using
her hero voice!

09:14.555 --> 09:15.854
Oh, we're back
in action!

09:15.856 --> 09:18.123
Mmm, time to go
on a stakeout.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.126
- Ah! Taking down
the Bake Sale Bandit

09:21.128 --> 09:22.994
is gonna be
a piece of cake!

09:22.996 --> 09:25.096
- [laughing]
We are so back!

09:25.098 --> 09:25.897
- [door closes]

09:25.899 --> 09:28.099
- I can't believe they
don't think we're ready.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.768
There's only one
thing we can do.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.870
- Put on our
fart shields?

09:32.773 --> 09:33.905
- No.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.141
We've gotta solve that
crime before mom and dad

09:36.143 --> 09:38.143
so we can show them
how good we are.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.711
- I like it.
One question.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.880
- There are no
fart shields!

09:45.152 --> 09:51.890
- ¶

09:51.892 --> 09:53.892
- Welcome to
the Power Derby.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.760
Goal number one--
to use your superpowers

09:55.762 --> 09:59.230
to force the other opponents
out of the green circle.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.766
Goal number two--
to entertain me,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.868
Commander Dirk Trumbo.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.770
Begin!

10:05.772 --> 10:06.771
- [dramatic music]

10:06.773 --> 10:10.141
- Okay, Max, let's review
our strate--whoa!

10:12.512 --> 10:14.646
- Ahhh! Ahhh!

10:14.648 --> 10:15.213
[heavy thud]

10:15.215 --> 10:18.583
- Nice work. Let's still
kick some hero butt.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.752
- [blaster firing]

10:20.754 --> 10:23.588
- Wait, Max, Balfour can't
get a nanochip on Galaxia.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.923
We have to help him.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.659
- ¶

10:27.661 --> 10:29.060
- [fists clanging]

10:29.062 --> 10:30.962
- Come on,
we made an alliance.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.064
- [groans]
Fine.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.801
- ¶

10:36.803 --> 10:37.602
- Thanks, guys.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.505
- Okay, I think we're
gettin' the hang of this.

10:40.507 --> 10:43.141
- Yeah, we don't
need the twin power.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.777
- ¶

10:45.779 --> 10:47.178
- She's pushing
us out of the circle!

10:47.180 --> 10:48.647
Let's do the Hipsters'
twin thing.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.882
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Twin power, activate!

10:53.553 --> 10:55.654
- Okay, it's not working.
It's stressing me out.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.889
- BOTH:
[hands clapping]

10:57.891 --> 11:00.225
- Oh, stop!
It's embarrassing!

11:00.227 --> 11:02.994
- ¶

11:02.996 --> 11:04.696
- [blaster firing]

11:04.698 --> 11:06.865
- ¶

11:06.867 --> 11:09.167
- COMMANDER TRUMBO:
There goes Shield Girl.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.935
What a loser.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.708
- [buzzer ringing]

11:16.710 --> 11:18.977
- Max, we made it
through the round.

11:18.979 --> 11:22.313
- There's the guy I never
doubted for a minute.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.115
[laughing]

11:24.117 --> 11:25.917
- We can actually
win this thing.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.621
- These beards will make
good hats for winter.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.659
Next, I come
for your swoosh.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.167
- ¶

11:42.169 --> 11:43.601
- Congratulations,

11:43.603 --> 11:46.871
the five of you have made
it to the final round.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.139
- Yes! Pound it!

11:48.141 --> 11:50.075
- [titanium fist thuds]
- Ohhhhh!

11:50.077 --> 11:51.276
- [loud crash]

11:51.278 --> 11:55.013
- The four of you have
made it to the final round.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.016
As a reward, the Z Force
is sending you home

11:58.018 --> 11:59.751
to have dinner
with your families.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.687
You will be beamed back
here at 10 p.m., sharp.

12:02.689 --> 12:03.755
Now tomorrow
is a big day,

12:03.757 --> 12:06.825
and you'll wanna
catch some Zs.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.293
Laugh at my jokes,
or you're out!

12:08.295 --> 12:10.729
- CONTESTANTS:
[laughing]

12:15.635 --> 12:17.802
- Hey, Balfour,
you're not leaving?

12:17.804 --> 12:19.804
- Yeah, don't you
wanna see your family?

12:19.806 --> 12:21.272
- Nah.
[laughs]

12:21.274 --> 12:22.907
I don't really
have a family.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.077
- Great, here comes
the sob story.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.214
- I grew up
in a super orphanage.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.648
- Told ya.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.183
- [sighing]
I never knew my mom,

12:32.185 --> 12:34.385
my dad was imprisoned
by the Hero League,

12:34.387 --> 12:35.887
when I was just a baby.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.255
All I have to
remember him by

12:37.257 --> 12:39.924
is the baby cape
that I was wrapped in

12:39.926 --> 12:42.026
when he said goodbye.

12:42.028 --> 12:42.994
- Oh...

12:42.996 --> 12:45.296
Wow, that's
heavy, man.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.332
Okay, we'll
see ya, buddy.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.800
- Max.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.969
So, are you just gonna
stay here tonight?

12:50.971 --> 12:51.703
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.338
I'm just gonna do
what I've done every night--

12:53.340 --> 12:56.641
play video games until
I cry myself to sleep.

12:57.944 --> 12:58.643
- He saved us, Max.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.746
The least we can do is invite
him to dinner at our house.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.381
- He's fine.
Look at him.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.217
- [sobbing]

13:06.219 --> 13:08.219
Why?
[sobbing continues]

13:08.221 --> 13:10.088
- Okay, you win.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.990
Balfour, do you wanna--
- I'd love to.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.292
[laughs] Guys,
I'm four feet away.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.895
I heard the whole thing.
Let's go.

13:16.897 --> 13:22.367
- ¶

13:22.369 --> 13:23.234
- BILLY:
Exhibit D--

13:23.236 --> 13:26.838
the sticky bun from
the middle school bake sale.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.373
- Exhibit letter
after D.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.375
- FEMALE ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

13:30.377 --> 13:31.242
Parents approaching.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.846
Hide your pathetic attempt
at an investigation.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.385
- And, so, when Alexander
Hamilton wore the first bow--

13:40.387 --> 13:42.153
Oh, hey, guys.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.888
- Hi, kids.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.323
- I'm learning.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.026
- Your mother and
I haven't caught

13:48.028 --> 13:49.194
the Bake Sale
Bandit yet.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.362
But we did catch
the snickerdoodles

13:51.364 --> 13:53.765
in the act of
being delicious.

13:53.767 --> 13:54.833
- You guys want one?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.135
- Thanks for taking a bite
out of this one, Dad.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.736
- I didn't bite
any of those.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.272
- ALL: [gasping]
The Bake Sale Bandit!

14:01.274 --> 14:03.141
- Now it's personal.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.043
- Let me go throw
these out.

14:05.045 --> 14:05.944
- Barb, that's evidence.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.913
Let me analyze them
with a glass of milk.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.283
- This toothless criminal
lives to bite another day.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.052
- What do you
mean "toothless"?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.153
- Whoever bit this cookie,

14:15.155 --> 14:16.454
is missing his
two front teeth.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.056
But it's not like
we're gonna go to

14:18.058 --> 14:19.190
the next bake
sale and find him.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.993
- Billy, that's exactly
what we should do.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.495
- Great. Case closed!

14:24.497 --> 14:26.831
- No, we still
have to go do it.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.499
- Case reopened!

14:32.038 --> 14:32.770
- Kids!

14:32.772 --> 14:34.405
- Guess who made
the final round.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.006
- Oh, ho!

14:35.008 --> 14:36.941
- And they let us
come home for dinner.

14:36.943 --> 14:37.942
Hey, where's Chloe?

14:37.944 --> 14:40.812
- [whooshing]
Phoebe! Max!

14:40.814 --> 14:41.813
Who's this guy?

14:41.815 --> 14:44.816
- Oh, um, everybody,
this is Balfour.

14:44.818 --> 14:45.884
- Wow.
[laughing]

14:45.886 --> 14:48.186
It is an honor
to meet you Thunder Man

14:48.188 --> 14:49.254
and Electress.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.155
- Oh, Hank, he's a fan.

14:51.157 --> 14:51.923
- HANK:
[laughing]

14:51.925 --> 14:52.957
- Balfour, come check
out my lair--

14:52.959 --> 14:56.060
unless you wanna hear about
the greatest saves of the '90s.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.495
- It was the summer
of 1997.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.965
Kenan and Kel were
at the top of their game,

15:00.967 --> 15:05.470
and so was Squid Man.
- Wait for me!

15:05.472 --> 15:08.806
- ¶

15:08.808 --> 15:11.242
- COLOSSO: Hey, glad
you're back, Max.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.543
- MAX:
[laughs]

15:12.545 --> 15:13.912
- Who's this goober?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.014
- What do you mean?
That's Phoebe.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.016
- No, the other goober.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.517
- Oh, he's another
Z Force finalist.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.052
- Oh, Balfour,
this is Dr. Colosso.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.154
He's a supervillain
that our dad defeated

15:23.156 --> 15:24.355
and turned into a rabbit.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.891
- What are you
starin' at, Goggles?

15:26.893 --> 15:29.861
- Have you always
had that cape?

15:29.863 --> 15:32.297
- My villain cape?
Of course.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.500
Max, this kid's more
annoying than Phoebe.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.570
- Dad?

15:42.309 --> 15:43.841
- Son!

15:43.843 --> 15:46.511
- ¶

15:49.416 --> 15:51.316
- ¶

15:51.318 --> 15:52.817
- COLOSSO: And that's
how I ended up

15:52.819 --> 15:54.185
living here
with the Thundermans.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.921
I guess this is
weird for you, huh?

15:56.923 --> 15:59.357
- Well, um,
you're a rabbit,

15:59.359 --> 16:03.328
and you talk,
and you're my dad.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.164
- And he poops
in public.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.233
Are we not
listing weird things?

16:09.469 --> 16:13.171
- The point is I'm
basically a prisoner here.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.272
- Are you okay, Balfour?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.941
I know this is a lot
to take in.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.277
- You'll have to
take it in later.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.079
We've gotta go back
and rest up for tomorrow.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.447
- No, please, I have
so many more questions.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.882
- It's all right.
You can come back some time.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.985
Trust me, he's not
going anywhere.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.319
Come on.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.825
- Bye, kids!
- Bye, kids!

16:33.827 --> 16:35.360
- Bye, my kid!

16:36.396 --> 16:40.231
- Welcome to
the Triadome.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.266
- [dramatic music]

16:42.268 --> 16:44.402
- You'll face three
extreme challenges

16:44.404 --> 16:46.437
without using
your powers.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.173
First, the neutronium
scorpion.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.944
Keep your hand inside
the case for ten seconds.

16:52.946 --> 16:53.978
The pain from its sting

16:53.980 --> 16:56.581
is unbearable to
most superheroes.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.052
Next,
the exploding coconut.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.121
Smash the right
one and live.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.255
Smash the wrong one

17:04.257 --> 17:07.091
and clean up
in aisle five.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.996
Finally,
the ear bud tangle.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.398
So annoying.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.066
So tangly!

17:15.335 --> 17:16.567
The first to finish
all the tests

17:16.569 --> 17:19.203
and hit that button
joins the Z Force.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.907
Fail and you'll be
beamed home immediately.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.242
- Good luck, guys.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.410
- I hope one of us wins.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.046
- Oh, one of us will.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.047
- [horn blasts]

17:29.049 --> 17:30.548
- Okay, let's
do this, Max.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.984
How bad can one
scorpion be, right?

17:34.020 --> 17:36.054
- BOTH:
[screaming]

17:36.056 --> 17:38.022
- It's like putting
your hand in a blender

17:38.024 --> 17:39.490
that's being eaten
by a shark.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.927
- Oh, at least Galaxia is
in as much pain as we are.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.263
- [laughing]
Tickles.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.031
- [buzzer rings]

17:47.033 --> 17:47.598
- [sighing]

17:47.600 --> 17:48.533
We made it.
Are you okay, Max?

17:48.535 --> 17:54.072
- No, I'm in excruciating pain
and I can't see colors.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.473
How's Balfour doing?

17:55.475 --> 17:56.507
- He's gonna nanochip
Galaxia.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.975
The Commander
said no powers.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.444
- He didn't say
anything about gadgets.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.978
- [blaster firing]
- [electronic bleep]

18:00.980 --> 18:03.481
- Well, he's getting
rid of Galaxia.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.483
- [electronic beep]

18:05.485 --> 18:07.118
- Why's he getting
rid of Galaxia

18:07.120 --> 18:09.454
by sending her
directly at us?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.622
- I would also
like to know this.

18:12.959 --> 18:17.462
- Because your family
imprisoned my father.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.496
You ruined my life

18:18.498 --> 18:20.364
and now I'm
gonna ruin yours.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.201
- You just had to invite
him to dinner, didn't you?

18:23.203 --> 18:25.069
- I was being polite.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.473
I have an idea.
- Make it a fast idea.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.909
- Don't explode.
Please, don't explode.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.512
Oh, all right.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.148
Hey, Galaxia, catch!

18:37.150 --> 18:39.083
- This won't tickle.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.284
- [explosion]

18:40.286 --> 18:42.086
- GALAXIA:
[coughing]

18:42.088 --> 18:43.421
Ow.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.591
- [angry squealing]

18:47.627 --> 18:49.327
- All right, it's down
to us and Balfour.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.229
- It's a good thing
we're way ahead.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.231
- [whimpering]

18:53.233 --> 18:56.234
- [dramatic music]

18:56.236 --> 18:57.001
- We were way ahead.

18:57.003 --> 19:00.171
Why are we still standing here?
- I don't know.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.410
- Look at us, Barb,

19:06.412 --> 19:08.579
working undercover
to scrape Hiddenville's

19:08.581 --> 19:11.382
underbelly clean
of criminal scum.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.251
Pass me another
pecan sandy.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.621
- Look, Principal Bradford just
took a bite out of something

19:16.623 --> 19:18.322
and walked away
without paying.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.291
- Move out!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:20.293 --> 19:22.560
Hold it right
there, Bradford!

19:22.562 --> 19:24.529
- What the...?
- Dad, Mom!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.964
- Kids, we told you
guys to stay out of this.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.299
Your Dad and I
are handling it.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.300
- But you've got
the wrong guy.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.669
The Bake Sale Bandit is
missing his two front teeth.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.604
- Let's ask that
toothless hockey player

19:33.606 --> 19:36.174
if he's seen
anybody suspicious.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.211
- That's the Bake
Sale Bandit!

19:40.213 --> 19:43.014
- Oh!
- He's getting away!

19:43.016 --> 19:54.725
- ¶

20:02.435 --> 20:03.167
- We got him!

20:03.169 --> 20:06.270
- No, Nora,
we got him!

20:06.272 --> 20:07.205
- [palm slap]

20:07.207 --> 20:08.573
- Very impressive.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.440
It looks like you guys

20:09.442 --> 20:11.442
are real crime
fighters, after all.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.343
- I guess you are ready

20:12.345 --> 20:14.445
to follow in Max
and Phoebe's footsteps.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.179
- Yeah.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.316
- Ha! I caught
the Bake Sale Bandit!

20:18.318 --> 20:20.184
Hey, somebody
take a picture.

20:20.186 --> 20:23.120
I want my ex-girlfriend
to see this.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.689
- [camera shutter clicks]

20:24.691 --> 20:27.091
- ¶

20:27.093 --> 20:28.593
- COMMANDER TRUMBO:
It looks like we have

20:28.595 --> 20:29.594
a good old-fashioned
showdown.

20:29.596 --> 20:33.631
Will it be the awkward
intensity of The Gamer...

20:34.734 --> 20:38.636
or the cool, collected teamwork
of the Thunder twins?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.471
- No, no, you're
making it worse.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.406
- No, I got it.
Trust me.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.342
- Not that way.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.278
- [dramatic music]

20:47.280 --> 20:48.179
¶

20:48.181 --> 20:49.747
- PHOEBE: Done!
- Balfour: Done!

20:49.749 --> 20:50.448
- [bell ringing]

20:50.450 --> 20:52.617
- And it's
the Thunder twins!

20:52.619 --> 20:55.653
- [celebratory music]

20:55.655 --> 21:01.125

21:01.127 --> 21:04.362
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

21:04.364 --> 21:05.830
No!

21:05.832 --> 21:08.199
- [dramatic music]

21:08.201 --> 21:09.567
- You're done, Gamer.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.234
Beam him home.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.638
- I have no home--
thanks to the Thundermans!

21:13.640 --> 21:16.540
But I will
have revenge!

21:16.542 --> 21:19.410
Revenge!

21:22.248 --> 21:24.181
- Well, he handled
that well.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.350
- Max, we made it
onto the Z Force!

21:26.352 --> 21:27.818
- I know.
[laughing]

21:27.820 --> 21:28.653
- Yes, uh, about that.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.255
- What is our first mission?
When do we get our uniforms?

21:31.257 --> 21:34.091
Do we get a discount
at the gift shop?

21:35.161 --> 21:35.860
- Negative.

21:35.862 --> 21:39.397
The Thunder twins
will never be on the Z Force.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.097
- Wait. Why not?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.632
- Because you don't
have a twin power.

21:41.634 --> 21:45.102
- So what? We just beat
the best superheroes you have.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.270
And the Hipster twins.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.674
- We don't need two supes
with the same abilities.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.708
We just need one of you.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.811
- So, what are you gonna do,
make us fight each other?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.546
- I was going
to flip a coin,

21:55.548 --> 21:58.149
but that sounds
much more fun.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.852
Sister versus brother.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.588
There can be only one!

22:04.590 --> 22:06.857
- [dramatic music]

22:06.859 --> 22:09.527
¶

22:12.265 --> 22:14.231
- Wait, so, you're
breaking up our team,

22:14.233 --> 22:16.300
and making us
battle each other?

22:16.302 --> 22:17.168
- Without a twin power,

22:17.170 --> 22:19.570
you're just two superheroes
with the same power.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.805
That's like
a two-topping pizza

22:20.807 --> 22:23.240
and both
the toppings are mushrooms.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.375
It's just dumb.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.344
- I can't fight
my own brother.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.178
- Yeah, we're family.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.314
- We, at the Z Force, put
everything before family--

22:30.316 --> 22:33.217
unless the Thundermans
aren't Z Force material.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.785
- Oh, we are so
Z Force material.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.254
- Then prove it by
facing off after lunch.

22:37.256 --> 22:40.324
Anyone wanna go in
on a double-mushroom pizza?

22:40.326 --> 22:42.927
I'm just kidding.
It's still dumb.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.199
- This is crazy.
- I know.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.301
After all that, they want
us to fight each other?

22:50.303 --> 22:51.769
We could have
done that from home.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.871
- [groans] We're
so close to our dream,

22:53.873 --> 22:57.341
and we have no choice
but to walk away.

22:57.343 --> 23:00.511
That is our only
choice, right?

23:00.513 --> 23:01.011
- Yeah.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.280
It's not like we can forget
about being partners

23:03.282 --> 23:04.882
and fight each other.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.651
- But I really wanna
be on the Z Force.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.220
- Me, too!

23:10.256 --> 23:12.790
- Okay, look, I know we
wanted to make it as a team,

23:12.792 --> 23:14.258
but this might
be the only way

23:14.260 --> 23:15.960
a Thunderman can
get on the Z Force.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.261
- If we don't do this,

23:17.263 --> 23:19.897
all the hard work
will be for nothing.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.468
- Okay, let's just agree
that, win or lose,

23:24.470 --> 23:26.771
we'll both be happy for
whoever makes it on.

23:26.773 --> 23:27.872
- You got it.
- Okay.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.540
- May the best Max win.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.941
- You mean, may
the best Phoebe win.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.576
- Mmm, I'm pretty
sure I'll win.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.611
- Yeah,
on Opposite Day.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.379
- On Opposite Day?
I don't think so.

23:35.381 --> 23:36.280
- Yeah, on Opposite Day.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.716
- I've been working out.
Have you seen me?

23:38.718 --> 23:40.551
- Hooray!

23:40.553 --> 23:42.887
- Are you ready?
One, two...

23:42.889 --> 23:44.388
- [dramatic music]

23:44.390 --> 23:47.758
- Playin' a little
family game, are we?

23:47.760 --> 23:52.563
Well, let the Thunder
Games begin!

23:52.565 --> 23:54.999
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

Alert! Alert!

24:06.946 --> 24:08.579
Shall we play a game?

24:08.581 --> 24:12.049
- Why is the Thunder Monitor
set to Math Tutor?

24:12.051 --> 24:14.752
- Because I'm in control.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.619
- Baldor?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.822
- It's not Baldor,
it's Barf Score.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.490
- It's Balfour.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.658
- Are you sure?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.726
- You know what?
Forget it.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.329
Just call me The Gamer.

Wakey, wakey,
Thundermans.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.583
I thought we might play

24:45.585 --> 24:49.320
a different kind
of family game.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.654
- COLOSSO:
A crazy-lookin' house,

24:50.656 --> 24:52.656
a family wearin'
silly hats.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.558
This game looks fun!

24:54.760 --> 24:57.628
- That does it.
The Gamer's getting zapped.

lasers don't work?

25:00.766 --> 25:03.467
- Oh, yeah, thanks
to my nanochip,

25:03.469 --> 25:07.071
you can't use your powers
unless I say so,

25:07.073 --> 25:08.439
and now I say so.

25:11.811 --> 25:12.576
Let's get out of here!

25:12.578 --> 25:16.947
- Whoa! Hit the brakes
there, Speedy.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.517
I also control
your movements. Look.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.051
- [electronic bleeping]

25:21.053 --> 25:22.386
- Why are you
doing this?

25:22.388 --> 25:26.590
- Because you Thundermans
imprisoned my father

25:26.592 --> 25:27.791
and took everything
from me.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.928
Max and Phoebe even stole
my spot on the Z Force.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.030
- Oh, did you hear
that, Hank?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.064
They won!

25:34.066 --> 25:34.932
- Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

25:34.934 --> 25:37.601
In your face,
Sport Door.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.402
- Silence!

25:38.404 --> 25:43.674
It's time I finally became
a villain like my father.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.608
- Atta boy, son.

25:44.610 --> 25:48.679
I don't really know you,
but I've never been prouder.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.516
- Now let's play
my favorite game.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.451
The Painters Save
the Princess.

25:54.453 --> 25:57.421
- I don't wanna
play that game.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.389
- Awww...

25:58.391 --> 26:00.558
Too bad.
Get in the castle.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.027
- [whooshing]

26:04.030 --> 26:06.830

26:06.832 --> 26:08.799
The painters
have to save her.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.569

26:22.982 --> 26:24.915
- Sorry, Dad.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.151
- Looks like you
need some coins

26:27.153 --> 26:29.153
to get past
that dragon.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.854
- [lasers zapping]

- I'm The Gamer.

huh, Dad?

one way it could be better.

back, Dad!

26:56.015 --> 26:58.482
Are you ready for
a little father/son time?

26:58.484 --> 26:59.183

26:59.185 --> 27:00.117
And, say, after we
finish here,

27:00.119 --> 27:03.654
how about we enter one of those
father/son beauty contests?

27:03.656 --> 27:06.156
It'd be a shame to
waste this much handsome.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.626
- BOTH:

mano a mano

27:17.036 --> 27:21.005
in the Max and Phoebe
Mano a Mano Face-off.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.008
This is an all-out

27:33.519 --> 27:34.218
- All right, Phoebe,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.920
our whole lives have
led up to this moment.

27:36.922 --> 27:37.921
Ow!

27:37.923 --> 27:39.189
What the heck?
- I'm sorry.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.960
Did the Max and Phoebe
Mano a Mano Face-off not start?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.664
- Fine! Let's dance.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.266
- BOTH:

This is amazing!

28:27.573 --> 28:29.840
- Punch-kick-elbow was
always your go-to combo?

28:29.842 --> 28:32.576
- Close, it was
punch-kick-elbow-flip.

28:32.578 --> 28:33.711
- Flip?

28:33.713 --> 28:34.778
Flip!

28:43.589 --> 28:44.722

Look at her.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.955
- Congratulations,
Max Thunderman.

Welcome to the Z Force.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.704
- Then after
the Z Force split us up,

29:33.706 --> 29:35.172
Max and I were
forced to do battle.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.775
It was a close fight
until I hurt my hand

29:37.777 --> 29:39.777
and Max won.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.111
What did your
parents say

29:41.113 --> 29:42.746
when they found out
that Max beat you?

29:42.748 --> 29:44.715
- Actually, I haven't
been home yet.

29:44.717 --> 29:45.983
I couldn't face them.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.084
I assume they'd say--

29:47.086 --> 29:50.154
- Hey, loser!
Outta my way!

29:50.156 --> 29:52.790
Smart girl.
Other one.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.826
Check out my million
dollar idea.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.729
It's the Bradford
Bouncy Ball.

29:58.731 --> 29:59.663
- Isn't that
just a ball?

29:59.665 --> 30:01.865
- [immitating] Isn't
that just a ball?

30:01.867 --> 30:05.002
You sound like
my ex-girlfriend, Joyce.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.204
Hey, watch this.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.173

Woo!

30:11.677 --> 30:13.010
- That was close.
Cherry, you okay?

30:13.012 --> 30:14.745
- She's fine.
Gimme that!

30:14.747 --> 30:18.081
This baby's my ticket
outta this toilet bowl.

30:19.051 --> 30:23.020
- Explain to me how that weirdo
is in charge of children.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.087
- Know what
else is weird?

30:24.089 --> 30:26.890
Catching that ball
with an injured hand.

30:26.892 --> 30:27.891
- Huh?

30:27.893 --> 30:30.194
Oh! Ow, my hand!

30:30.196 --> 30:32.062
- It was
the other hand.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.031
- Ow, my other hand!

30:34.033 --> 30:35.532
- Come on, Phoebs,

30:35.534 --> 30:38.936
tell your Cherr-Bear
what's really going on.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.506
- Okay, look...

30:42.508 --> 30:44.641
I realized that the only
way to achieve my dream

30:44.643 --> 30:46.710
was to take Max's
dream away from him,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.779
and I couldn't do
that to my own brother,

30:48.781 --> 30:54.918
so, I faked this hand
injury and let him win.

30:54.920 --> 30:55.786
- Okay, Phoebe.

30:55.788 --> 30:58.856
Now tell me what's
really going on.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.691
- That is what's
really going...

31:00.693 --> 31:02.593
I just admitted
everything.

31:02.595 --> 31:03.126
- Hmmm...

31:03.128 --> 31:05.529
- I should go
tell my family.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.599
- So, Joyce, do you wanna
get back together?

31:08.601 --> 31:11.068
The ball's in
your court.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.603
[laughing]

31:12.605 --> 31:14.671
It's Tad Bradford.

Hello, Thunder twins.

Once Max and Phoebe
see that,

31:41.800 --> 31:42.966
they'll come running.

31:42.968 --> 31:45.736
- Hey, guys, I'm home.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.577
Balfour!
Let my family go!

31:53.579 --> 31:54.344
- I have a better idea.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.131
is even more amazing
than I dreamed.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.066
I mean, these suits
are so comfortable.

32:16.068 --> 32:20.103
- Mm, there's no silk
like Mole People silk.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.005
Ah, here's your Z Key.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.741
It gets you access
to the supersonic hovercraft,

32:24.743 --> 32:25.609

32:25.611 --> 32:28.111
and the executive bathroom

all these privileges, right?

32:31.984 --> 32:34.785

he was one of us.

I tell if it's charged?

my game, if you dare.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.814
Oh, by the way,
this is Balfour.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.682
I have your family.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.151
- Oh, no.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.621
Commander, we need to
go to Hiddenville right now.

33:11.623 --> 33:12.622
My family's in danger.

nah-unh, Max.

33:13.926 --> 33:15.926
I just got word
that Flame Brothers

33:15.928 --> 33:16.727
have escaped from prison.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.662
Your freeze breath makes
you the perfect member

33:18.664 --> 33:21.064
to put them on ice,
once and for all.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.232
Let's go, team!

33:22.234 --> 33:24.668
- But, wait!

33:24.670 --> 33:25.936
What about my family?

33:25.938 --> 33:28.271
- Again, Z Force here,

33:28.273 --> 33:29.773
family, near here.

33:29.775 --> 33:34.644
Or maybe you're not meant

What kind of
game is this?

33:54.266 --> 33:56.867
- What is taking
Max so long?

33:56.869 --> 33:57.534
- He's not coming.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.137
They made us compete for
the last Z Force slot

34:00.139 --> 34:01.138
and he won.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.040
- Max beat you?
[chuckling]

34:03.042 --> 34:04.975
That's my Maxy!

34:04.977 --> 34:08.378
- Dad, this is
my moment.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.982
- Sorry. Go on
with your thing.

34:11.984 --> 34:13.917
- [grunts]
I can't!

34:13.919 --> 34:17.254
Without Max here, it won't
be complete revenge.

34:17.990 --> 34:19.156
- Chin up, Slugger.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.791
You can still get
hilarious revenge

34:20.793 --> 34:23.860
against the rest
of the Thundermans.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.763
- You're right, Dad.

34:26.765 --> 34:27.798
[presses pause]

34:27.800 --> 34:32.803
Why don't we take
this to the next level?

34:33.906 --> 34:34.538
- A giant cage?

34:34.540 --> 34:36.706
What does this have to
do with video games?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.108
- Oh, I'm through
playing games.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.310
Since you forced my dad
to live in a cage,

34:40.312 --> 34:45.148
let's see how you enjoy
living like animals.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.051
- I love this thing!

34:48.053 --> 34:50.020
- Billy, stop
liking our prison.

34:50.022 --> 34:52.022
We have to keep
our dignity.

Look at 'em.

34:55.027 --> 34:56.893
Now they'll get a taste
of the rabbit life.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.429
- Oh, Dad, they'll get
more than just a taste.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.766
I'm gonna use my nanochips
to fry their brains

35:02.768 --> 35:06.036
until they are as dumb
as actual rabbits.

35:06.038 --> 35:07.204
- Ooh!
[chuckling]

35:07.206 --> 35:10.173
- Don't worry, guys,
I'll run and get help.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.215
- You're gonna
fry our brains?

35:18.217 --> 35:22.119
I can't believe
I nerd flirted with you.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.120
- I can.

The Gamer's
got game. Woo!

to do something--

other than eat
the food pellets.

me eat it.

touching the controller.

- Do something,
Dr. Colosso.

35:39.905 --> 35:40.437
- I am.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.405
I'm gonna watch
all the fun!

35:42.407 --> 35:44.407

35:44.409 --> 35:45.809
- Great plan, son.
- Oh.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.844
- You've really got
this villain thing down.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.413
- Maybe seeing his family
with bunny brains

35:50.415 --> 35:53.416
will get Max here.
- Yeah!

35:53.418 --> 35:56.052
- Then I can fry
his brain, too.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.821
- Yeah, ya will!
Wait. What?

35:57.823 --> 36:01.424
You don't wanna do
that to Max.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.993
- Of course, I do.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.928
He turned you
into an animal.

- No, that's
his dumb dad.

36:08.734 --> 36:09.466
Max is cool!

36:09.468 --> 36:12.169
He's like the evil
son I never had.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.472
- I am the evil
son you never had!

36:15.474 --> 36:18.775
You make a better rabbit
than you do father.

36:19.511 --> 36:23.780
- COLOSSO: Son,
I see you're upset.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.215
So, why don't you
let me out

36:25.217 --> 36:27.317
and we can talk about
this over ice cream?

36:27.319 --> 36:28.952
- My body can't
process milk--

36:28.954 --> 36:32.355
which you would know,
if you were around!

36:35.794 --> 36:36.293
- Uh...

36:36.295 --> 36:37.928
Balfour, it must
have been so hard

36:37.930 --> 36:39.296
growing up
without a family.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.332
Please, tell us
all about it.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.833
- It was awful.

36:43.835 --> 36:44.935
I was so alone.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.136
Do you know
what happens

36:46.138 --> 36:49.072
when you ask a video
game to tuck you in at night?

36:49.074 --> 36:51.041
It says, "Buh Boh".

36:51.843 --> 36:53.510
But I guess a life
playing video games

36:53.512 --> 36:55.946
did allow me to
hone my instincts.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.315
Like being able to
sense a sneak attack!

Oh, welcome, Maxy!

37:12.998 --> 37:15.432
So happy that
you could join us.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.002
- I'm sorry, guys.
I tried.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.972
- That was very
brave of you, Max.

37:21.974 --> 37:23.940
- Stop loving him!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.545
Okay, Thundermans,

37:28.547 --> 37:32.415
you're about to get
seriously stupid.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.083
[laughs]

37:33.085 --> 37:34.317
- Max, what are you
even doing here?

37:34.319 --> 37:36.419
I thought you were
with the Z Force.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.020
- I left.

37:37.022 --> 37:40.257
I realized I couldn't put
anything before family.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.592
- Ooooh, it's begun.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.895
Prepare for
bunny brains.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.465
- [high-pitched ringing]

37:48.467 --> 37:50.133
- This is it.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.036
[voice cracking]
Everyone, hold hands.

37:53.038 --> 37:56.139
We will go down
the way we lived--

37:56.141 --> 37:58.041
as a family.

38:00.178 --> 38:01.845
- I love you all.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.947
- MAX & PHOEBE:
I love you, too, Mom.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.416
- [solemn music]

38:06.418 --> 38:07.417
- Bye, Phoebe.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.886
- [sniffles]
Goodbye, Max.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.188
- [electrical zapping]

38:12.190 --> 38:14.324
- What's happening
with your hands?

38:14.326 --> 38:15.959
- I don't know.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.260
- It's like...

38:17.262 --> 38:18.261
a power.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.163
- Max, you don't think...

38:20.165 --> 38:21.031
- Twin power?

38:21.033 --> 38:22.032
- Let's give it a shot.

38:22.034 --> 38:23.033
- [controller buzzing]

38:23.035 --> 38:25.869
- No! What's going on?
You can't use any powers.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.305
I am The Gamer!
I'm in control!

38:28.307 --> 38:30.307
- [dramatic music]

38:30.309 --> 38:31.908
- Not anymore.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.543
- [dramatic music]

38:33.545 --> 38:35.545
- [explosion]

38:40.285 --> 38:42.218
- Everybody okay?
- ALL: Yeah.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.087
- [groans]
No.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.590
- The blast was so strong,
it shorted out the chips.

38:47.592 --> 38:50.360
- HANK: Quick, pull
it off your necks.

38:51.596 --> 38:55.332
- Max, we had twin
power all along.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.634
- Seeing your family
in mortal danger

38:57.636 --> 38:58.368
must have unlocked it.

38:58.370 --> 39:02.505
- No, I'm pretty sure we've
just never held hands before.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.474
- I will have
my revenge!

39:04.476 --> 39:07.444
- [zooming]
Don't think so.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.212
- [lasers zapping]

39:09.214 --> 39:10.213
- Oh!

39:10.215 --> 39:12.148
- Game over, Balfour.

39:12.150 --> 39:12.982
- My name is Bal--

39:12.984 --> 39:15.618
Hey, you actually got
it right this time.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.519
- Come on, Balfour,

39:16.521 --> 39:18.254
you can spend
the rest of your life

39:18.256 --> 39:20.990
playing video games
in Hero League prison.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.459
- Wait, wait, wait.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.094
You can't fly
Balfour to prison.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.463
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

39:27.566 --> 39:29.332
- The only reason
he did all of this

39:29.334 --> 39:31.501
is because he grew up
without a family,

39:31.503 --> 39:34.371
and as annoying as
all of you are,

39:34.373 --> 39:37.040
I can't imagine
life without you.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.042
- Awww...

39:39.044 --> 39:41.511
Well, as much as we
appreciate that, Max,

39:41.513 --> 39:44.180
we still have to do
something with him.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.049
- [whimpering]

39:46.051 --> 39:48.051
- I have an idea.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.621
Also, I'm alive.
Thanks for caring.

39:52.057 --> 39:56.359
There might be another
form of punishment for him.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.162
- [dramatic music]

39:59.164 --> 40:01.698
- BALFOUR:
I'm a bunny?

40:02.434 --> 40:05.268
How is this
better than prison?

40:06.438 --> 40:08.238
- It's way better.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.005
You and I can catch up,

40:09.007 --> 40:11.274
and we can play
Insult the Thundermans

40:11.276 --> 40:13.176
all day long.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.010
Hey, Phoebe,

40:14.012 --> 40:17.514
slice me some bread with
those elbows, would ya?

40:17.516 --> 40:18.415
[chuckling]

40:18.417 --> 40:20.016
- BALFOUR:
[laughing]

40:20.018 --> 40:21.184
Good one, Pop.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.318
Let me try.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.486
Hey, Max?

40:23.488 --> 40:25.054
Die!

40:26.158 --> 40:28.024
- Okay, well,
we'll work on it.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.560
Hey, now let's go poop
in their shoes.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.495
- BALFOUR:
[laughing]

40:32.497 --> 40:35.298
- So, Phoebs,
I was wondering--

40:35.300 --> 40:37.734
- No, Balfour cannot
stay in my room.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.371
- Actually, I was
gonna ask if maybe

40:41.373 --> 40:43.606
you wanted to keep
fighting crime together.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.342
- Really? You still
wanna be a team?

40:46.344 --> 40:47.043
- Yeah.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.512
You know, we have a pretty
awesome twin power.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.115
- It would be a shame
to waste it.

40:53.185 --> 40:55.084
Partners?

40:55.086 --> 40:56.352
- Partners.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.320
- [electrical zapping]

40:57.322 --> 40:58.621
- So, fist bumps
from now on?

40:58.623 --> 40:59.456
- Totally.
- Cool.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.058
- FEMALE ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

41:02.060 --> 41:05.128
Super President Kickbutt
approaching.

41:08.733 --> 41:11.201
- Look, if this is about
me leaving the Z Force,

41:11.203 --> 41:13.470
I'm sorry,
but Max Thunderman

41:13.472 --> 41:15.605
doesn't put
anything before family.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.439
- Oh, I agree.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.075
That's why I fired
the Commander.

41:19.077 --> 41:19.642
- ALL: Huh?

41:19.644 --> 41:21.144
- The Hero League
has no use for

41:21.146 --> 41:23.346
an arrogant, hotshot
who cares more about

41:23.348 --> 41:26.583
saying his own name
than saving lives.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.251
- Wait. So, what
happened to him?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.285
- [snaps fingers]

41:29.287 --> 41:31.788
- Here's your latte,
Madam President.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.126
- I said light foam,
you fool!

41:37.128 --> 41:38.528
Go wait in
the hovercar.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.764
- Oh, how Dirk Trumbo
has fallen.

41:43.568 --> 41:46.269
- So, who's gonna run
the Z Force now?

41:46.271 --> 41:48.638
- In light of their
consistent performance

41:48.640 --> 41:49.772
battling
the Villain League,

41:49.774 --> 41:54.110
and their understanding of
the true nature of heroism,

41:54.112 --> 41:56.713
I'm making the new
head of the Z Force

41:56.715 --> 41:58.548
Phoebe and Max.
- ALL: [gasp]

41:58.550 --> 42:00.383
- What?
- We're the head of the Z Force?

42:00.385 --> 42:03.119
- Thank you,
Super President Kickbutt.

42:03.121 --> 42:03.853
This is such an honor.

42:03.855 --> 42:08.791
- As the new commanders,
you can hire whomever you want.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.593
- Uh...

42:10.595 --> 42:12.161
Anyone we want, huh?

42:12.163 --> 42:12.795
Um...

42:12.797 --> 42:15.498
Well, we sure could
use a superhero

42:15.500 --> 42:17.700
with superstrength.
- Oh, ho!

42:17.702 --> 42:19.402
- Electricity
would be handy, too.

42:19.404 --> 42:20.537
- And, of course,
superspeed, lasers,

42:20.539 --> 42:23.273
and teleporting could really
help us make some saves.

42:23.275 --> 42:24.874
- ALL:
[laughing]

42:24.876 --> 42:28.444
- Good luck finding
a hero with all those powers.

42:29.414 --> 42:30.580
- Billy, he means us.

42:30.582 --> 42:32.682
We're finally gonna
be superheroes.

42:32.684 --> 42:35.318
Laser Girl,
reporting for duty.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.588
- And call me...
[zooming]

42:38.590 --> 42:40.623
The Rapid Gentleman.

42:41.526 --> 42:44.160
- How about Kid Quick?

42:44.162 --> 42:46.162
- Kid Quick!

42:46.464 --> 42:48.231
- Guys, are you sure
about this?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.800
- Hey, you guys gave
up being superheroes

42:50.802 --> 42:52.302
so we could live
a normal life.

42:52.304 --> 42:55.505
But maybe being in
a family of superheroes

42:55.507 --> 42:57.273
is our normal life.

42:58.743 --> 43:00.710
- What do you
say, Barb?

43:00.712 --> 43:01.678
- Well, I say...

43:01.680 --> 43:04.180
it looks like Thunder Man
and Electress

43:04.182 --> 43:04.914
are back in action!

43:04.916 --> 43:09.218
- Don't forget
Thunder Baby, baby!

43:09.854 --> 43:12.188
- Thundermans, suit up!

43:12.190 --> 43:15.858
- ¶

43:15.860 --> 43:16.726
- Good. You're ready.

43:16.728 --> 43:19.462
The South China Sea
has been taken over

43:19.464 --> 43:20.563
by the Brain Puncher.

43:20.565 --> 43:24.701
Your supersonic jet
is waiting for you outside.

43:25.470 --> 43:26.469
- Well, I can fly.

43:26.471 --> 43:27.604
- And I can teleport.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.539
- Do you want
the jet or not?!

43:29.541 --> 43:31.708
- ALL:
Yes, ma'am, we do.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.843
- Good luck, Z Force!

43:33.845 --> 43:37.213
- ALL:
[excited hooting]

43:37.215 --> 43:38.881
- ¶

43:38.883 --> 43:41.484
- Oh, Phoebe,
should we...

43:41.486 --> 43:43.419
- Oh, one more thing.

43:43.421 --> 43:45.688
It's not
the Z Force anymore.

43:45.690 --> 43:47.523
It's the T Force.

43:47.525 --> 43:48.558
- [celebratory music]

43:48.560 --> 43:51.427
- T for the Thundermans.
- I think she got it.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.898
Now let's go save
the world.

43:55.900 --> 44:10.246
- ¶

44:13.084 --> 44:29.232
- ¶
