WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.104
Grace, hurry up.

00:03.204 --> 00:06.040
We're gonna be late
for our childbirth class.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.608
You know what
was a bad idea?

00:07.708 --> 00:11.045
Watching Alien last night.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.280
Now every time
I feel the baby kick,

00:13.314 --> 00:14.582
I think it's trying
to chew its way out of me.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.185
Well, it's your baby.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.020
It's gonna chew something.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.022
Stop worrying,
you're gonna be fine.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.424
As long as you go to class
and do everything right.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.592
Have you taken
your pre-natal vitamins?

00:25.559 --> 00:28.329
Let me see your nails.
Good, nice and healthy.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.064
Wow, look at your nails.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.732
You'd think you were
taking pre-natal vitamins too.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.367
Yeah, I am.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.603
Yeah, my nails are stronger.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.105
My hair is thicker.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.140
My balls may be shrinking,
but who cares?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.774
You know.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.146
I use my fabulous hair
and nails to draw the men in.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.714
Hey guys,
sorry I'm late.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.416
Ever since I made detective
it takes me forever

00:48.516 --> 00:50.050
to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.119
Hey.

00:51.985 --> 00:52.853
You know, the right shirt
can really

00:52.886 --> 00:55.156
pull together a crime scene.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.257
Oh, um...

00:56.357 --> 00:57.358
Will and I are
just heading out

00:57.458 --> 00:58.526
to my childbirth class.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.660
He's my labor coach.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.728
I hope it's okay.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.062
I asked Vince
to come along with us

01:02.996 --> 01:04.265
'cause we're gonna
go to the movies later on.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.099
But nothing
with Nicole Kidman.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.168
I'm not a fan since she
and Keith Urban

01:07.268 --> 01:09.203
became the
hot lesbian couple.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.506
Hey, Vince.
Hey, Will.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.142
Hey, Grace.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.610
Hey, little Jack.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.681
I'm not naming
my baby Jack.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.318
What baby?
I was talking to my penis.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.222
You guys,
I'm so freaked out.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.558
I just got the first script
for my new TV show The Badge.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.426
And my character,
Detective Chuck Rafferty

01:32.526 --> 01:34.495
has to pistol whip somebody.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.698
Hey, you know, Jack,
maybe I can help you.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.099
When I was addicted
to painkillers,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.536
I used to pistol whip people
for jaywalking.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.873
Yeah...no.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.642
I need a man's man.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.611
Someone who really knows
what it is to be

01:50.711 --> 01:52.413
a violent,
womanizing alcoholic.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.216
Hey kids.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.284
[cheers and applause]

02:14.535 --> 02:16.470
Oh, I'm so glad
that Jew-petto

02:16.570 --> 02:18.739
and Fenoccio
are finally gone.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.644
You know, it's really
starting to bug me

02:23.744 --> 02:26.314
that they're always
hanging around here.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.516
And honey, it's perfect
because there's so much

02:28.616 --> 02:29.483
going at the manse.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.185
I really need
to talk to you.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.720
Karen, I'm sorry.
I can't.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.723
I'm due on the set and I still
haven't figured out

02:35.756 --> 02:37.691
a way to access anger
for my pistol whipping scene.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.261
You know, it is hard
to stay angry

02:40.361 --> 02:42.530
when pistol whipping.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.367
I think it's because
after the first

02:46.467 --> 02:48.602
couple of whacks,
you get the giggles.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.739
Anyway, honey, I really do
need to talk to you.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.474
This is about
my marriage.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.477
Uh, and this is
about television.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.645
All right?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.813
And right now I really
need you to help me

02:59.847 --> 03:00.814
rehearse my scene.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.949
Okay.

03:01.982 --> 03:02.916
Well, as long as we can
talk about my stuff afterward.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.784
Okay.
Okay.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.185
All right.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.520
You've got ten seconds

03:07.655 --> 03:08.622
until I start pounding you
like a five dollar whore.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.358
You got that, pumpkin?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.560
Uh, well...

03:12.660 --> 03:13.761
Honey, this says "punk".

03:14.762 --> 03:16.397
Are sure that you should
be changing the lines?

03:16.497 --> 03:18.866
You know, you're right.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.401
I really should
respect the vision

03:20.501 --> 03:23.604
of these 26 writers.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.342
Wow, look at those names.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.478
It's like Schindler's List.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.885
You know, honey,
maybe I can help you.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.787
You know, back in the day
when I was roommates

03:39.887 --> 03:41.589
with Stanislav--

03:41.689 --> 03:44.758
Oh, I mean Uta Hagen--

03:44.858 --> 03:47.495
I mean...

03:47.595 --> 03:50.964
Claire Danes...

03:51.064 --> 03:53.467
we used to study
a technique

03:53.567 --> 03:54.602
called "sense memory".

03:54.702 --> 03:55.936
Mm-hmm,
it's where you recall

03:56.036 --> 03:58.005
an earlier experience
and then recreate

03:58.105 --> 03:59.239
that emotion.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.574
It's a form
of Method Acting.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.677
Mm, sounds kid of
out there.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.446
I mean,
I've never heard of it.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.615
And I taught acting.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.818
Well, here's an example.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.820
If I had to
make myself angry,

04:12.920 --> 04:16.724
I would take myself back
to, well, this morning

04:16.824 --> 04:19.927
when Stan was slurping
and sawing his way

04:20.027 --> 04:21.762
through his usual breakfast.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.566
Two poached deer
and a half a grapefruit.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.336
I felt my stomach...

04:28.436 --> 04:29.770
begin to tighten.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.539
And I thought,

04:31.639 --> 04:34.642
if I have to sit here
for one more day,

04:34.742 --> 04:37.645
I am literally going
to leap across this table

04:37.745 --> 04:41.682
and rip his heart
right out of his body.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.619
Oh, I mean I am going
to claw my way

04:45.719 --> 04:48.456
through the hair
and the flesh

04:48.556 --> 04:51.058
and the fat
and the internal hair

04:51.158 --> 04:52.560
and more fat...

04:54.695 --> 04:56.430
Until I hold

04:56.530 --> 05:01.335
his beating,
40-pound heart in my hand.

05:01.435 --> 05:06.440
And squeeze
until it is still.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.410
Oh, my God, Karen.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.346
I had no idea
that it was so easy

05:12.446 --> 05:14.548
to look angry.

05:15.749 --> 05:19.052
All I have to do
is squeeze my fist

05:19.152 --> 05:22.523
and grimace.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.826
Cagney and Lacey underwear,
I'm late!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.462
Thank you so much, Karen.
You saved my life.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.897
Hey, wait a minute!
What about my stuff?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.665
Didn't you hear a word
I just said?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.535
No, I was too busy
watching you.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.638
I can't look and listen
at the same time.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.641
I'm not some robot
from the future.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.413
So you're okay out here
while we're in class?

05:45.513 --> 05:46.980
Oh, God, yeah.
I got a ton of paperwork.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.549
If we're ever gonna
catch this lunatic

05:48.649 --> 05:49.950
who's been killing people
in the subway,

05:50.050 --> 05:51.084
I gotta spend
all my free time

05:52.019 --> 05:53.454
pouring over every detail
of this case.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.689
A subway killer?
That's terrifying.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.558
We're still going to the
movies though later, right?

05:57.658 --> 05:58.626
Oh, God, yeah,
but we're taking a cab.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.796
Okay, let's get started.

06:02.896 --> 06:03.997
Oh, could we wait
another minute?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.700
My boyfriend's
not here yet.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.736
Sheila, I'm sorry, but we can't
do this every class.

06:08.836 --> 06:09.737
I know
he'll be here.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.038
I left 15 messages
for him

06:11.138 --> 06:13.541
at his wife's house.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.078
Now I know
where I know you from.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.447
Didn't you work
at a fertility clinic

06:19.547 --> 06:20.514
I went to
a couple years ago?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.616
Oh, yeah.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.384
You know,
after I got fired,

06:24.485 --> 06:25.686
I took your sperm
and kept it in my freezer

06:25.786 --> 06:28.722
for eight months.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.891
Small world.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.762
It's probably
none of my business,

06:34.862 --> 06:36.764
but that's not mine,
is it?

06:36.864 --> 06:38.666
Nah.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.833
I went with an Irish guy.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.035
I wanna be able
to drink with my kid.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.774
It just breaks my heart
to think of that woman

06:46.874 --> 06:48.642
going through this
all by herself.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.579
Sheila, don't you think
you should get rid of that?

06:51.679 --> 06:54.615
I think
it's a little too late.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.850
You know what?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.452
I'm gonna get Vince
to help her.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.720
Although he's probably
knee-deep

07:00.788 --> 07:01.789
in that research material
about the serial killer.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.794
Yes!

07:06.894 --> 07:10.831
Six kids
and living in a castle.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.099
Cut!

07:12.199 --> 07:13.534
Great work, guys.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.969
You were amazing
in that scene, Jack.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.671
You were so intense!

07:17.771 --> 07:19.773
I thought you were gonna
pistol whip me for real.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.108
I wanted to.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.143
It bugs me when straight people
look like you.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.114
Honey, how'd it go?
Great, Karen.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.682
That stuff you taught me
really works.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.717
Oh, good.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.552
Well, I wanted
to watch the scene,

07:32.586 --> 07:33.754
but just as it was starting
a red light went on.

07:33.854 --> 07:37.758
And, well,
old habits die hard.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.701
So, honey,
remember when I said

07:47.801 --> 07:49.136
that I needed
to talk to you earlier?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.671
Well,
now you'll never believe--

07:50.771 --> 07:51.672
Oh, good!

07:51.772 --> 07:52.740
The pages
from my next scene.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.741
I'm sorry, Karen,
go on.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.908
Oh, okay, well...

07:55.008 --> 07:55.909
After I left you,

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
I went straight back
to the manse.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.147
Because, honey, I finally knew
what I needed to do.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.749
But then the most
unexpected thing happened.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.750
Oh, my God, Karen.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.985
I have to have sex
with a woman!

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
I don't how to do that!

08:07.087 --> 08:08.989
It never occurred to me
that my character,

08:09.089 --> 08:14.227
womanizer Chuck Rafferty,
would have sex with a woman.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.031
I thought "womanizer" meant
he eliminated women.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.903
But honey, seriously, I really
need do need to tell you--

08:23.003 --> 08:24.838
Later, later, Karen.
I really need your help again.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.674
All right.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.875
Okay, all right, my character
makes love

08:27.975 --> 08:28.909
to his partner's wife.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.578
But then
he gets all sad

08:30.678 --> 08:32.079
because it can
never happen again.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.616
I mean, okay,
first of all, why is he sad?

08:35.716 --> 08:37.017
I mean, he should be happy

08:37.117 --> 08:40.721
that he doesn't have to
have sex with a woman again.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.156
Honey, sometimes sex
can be very sad.

08:43.256 --> 08:48.662
Take this afternoon
when Stan and I made love.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.531
Jackie, I had planned
to ask him to move out.

08:51.632 --> 08:55.035
But then...

08:55.135 --> 08:57.905
I don't know,
our eyes met in the mirror

08:58.005 --> 09:00.307
while he was
brushing his tooth, and...

09:01.809 --> 09:04.845
He touched me, Jackie.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.648
He touched me in a way
that he hasn't touched me

09:07.748 --> 09:09.082
since we met.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.819
20 years...

09:11.919 --> 09:17.725
12 heart attacks,
and untold melanomas ago.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.992
Poor guy.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.730
He's so fat, a part of him
is always in the sun.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.872
And as I closed my eyes
and surrendered to the moment,

09:31.972 --> 09:38.812
I felt all of my rage
just slipping away.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.248
I missed him.

09:41.348 --> 09:45.753
I missed
who he was and...

09:45.853 --> 09:48.989
who we once were.

09:49.089 --> 09:49.857
And then I knew.

09:49.957 --> 09:54.795
I knew that
that was the last time

09:54.895 --> 09:58.365
that we would ever be
together like that again.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.035
[sighing]

10:02.135 --> 10:04.037
Perfect!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.873
All I gotta do
is close my eyes and sigh.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.810
Then it'll be easier
for me to imagine

10:09.910 --> 10:12.045
the actress
playing my partner's wife

10:12.145 --> 10:13.947
is actually Kevin Bacon
in a Speedo

10:14.047 --> 10:15.949
made of Twizzlers.

10:17.851 --> 10:21.088
That's all you got
from what I just said?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.823
You know, Jack,

10:22.923 --> 10:24.224
I've got real problems.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.959
And if you're not
gonna help me,

10:26.059 --> 10:28.896
I'm not always gonna be here
at your beck and call.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.667
Kevin Bacon called?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.636
Now, let's get used
to carrying a baby.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.938
But please be careful
with them.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.873
They were used
to train police dogs,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.209
so one of them might have
a brick of heroin in it.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.244
[cell phone ringing]

10:44.344 --> 10:47.014
Excuse me,
I gotta get this.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.381
It's either my mother
or my captain.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.884
I get
their numbers confused.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.086
They're both bitches.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.024
Hurry up, I don't want the one
that looks like Mena Suvari.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.027
What are you talking about?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.028
What plastic baby
looks like--

11:01.128 --> 11:05.098
Oh, there she is.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.299
Now, a few of them
are missing arms and legs,

11:06.399 --> 11:07.968
so you'll just have
to make do.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.169
I'll take one of those.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.104
Might as well
get used to it.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.010
So you're alone too, huh?

11:17.110 --> 11:17.978
Oh, oh, no.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.982
No, I'm not alone.
I have Will.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.984
And one of these days...

11:24.084 --> 11:26.119
I mean, as soon as I
get in touch with the father,

11:26.219 --> 11:27.721
I'll have him too.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.958
Oh, hey,
that was my captain.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.826
They found another body
on the D train.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.127
I'm gonna have to pop by
the coroner's office.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.029
Oh, that's horrible.

11:36.129 --> 11:36.897
Are we gonna
miss the movie?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.165
Not if we leave now.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.234
Can you finish the class
by yourself?

11:41.334 --> 11:44.337
Oh, um.
Uh, yeah.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.705
Yeah.
Yeah, that's fine.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.706
I'll just--I'll see you
later tonight.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.042
Actually, I'm gonna
be at Vince's tonight.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.410
Okay.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.780
I'll see you
when I see you.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.950
Oh, this is yours.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.827
Jack, can I give you

12:06.927 --> 12:08.495
a little
constructive criticism?

12:08.595 --> 12:10.163
Uh, take it up
with someone else.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.399
I didn't build the sets.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.203
No, I actually think
we need more rehearsal.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.138
I mean, do you wanna
go over the next scene?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.507
Okay.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.076
But I just can't,
you know, turn it on.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.312
I need some time
to get into character.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.348
Okay.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.451
Chuck, we need to talk about
your partner Darren.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.020
Do you even
wanna know why

12:33.120 --> 12:34.421
he walked out of here angry?

12:34.521 --> 12:37.290
Darren wasn't...

12:37.390 --> 12:40.227
angry.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.095
Yes, Darren was.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.864
Darren was trying
to tell you something.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.466
But you were to caught up
acting like a big shot cop

12:46.566 --> 12:47.801
to actually listen.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.138
Huh.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.439
Um...

12:52.539 --> 12:55.108
The line is
"Shut up, bitch."

12:55.208 --> 12:56.476
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.046
Shut up, bitch.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.315
I won't shut up.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.085
You and Darren
have been friends for years.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.555
And you weren't there
when he needed you most.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.959
Now he has
to use a walker.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.294
Look at this picture.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.397
Look at it close, Rafferty.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.368
Darren, walker.

13:21.468 --> 13:26.006
Darren, your best friend,
needed you.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.407
And you didn't listen.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.342
Oh, my God.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.212
Darren Walker needed me
and I didn't listen.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.246
I'll be right back.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.188
Can we get somebody
from the constructive crew?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.223
I have some criticism
for them.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.295
[blender buzzing]

13:48.395 --> 13:49.596
(Vince)
Hey, did I tell you?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.564
We finally caught
that subway killer today.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.001
I thought you said you arrested
somebody yesterday.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.402
Oh, yeah, turns out
he was the wrong guy.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
Worked him over
pretty good too.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.107
Well, at least now
he has a funny story.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.877
Grace, come on.
Are you ready for class?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.212
Oh, geez, I gotta go
pick up Sheila.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.446
I'll see you there, right?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.381
Wait, you're still
her partner?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.217
Yeah, she's a good kid.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.351
Plus it'll be nice
to help somebody

14:11.451 --> 14:14.354
deliver a baby in a hospital
instead of a Burger King

14:14.454 --> 14:16.323
or an upside-down
Trans Am.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.127
Thanks for interrupting
my sex dream

14:20.227 --> 14:25.365
just as Ang Lee and I
were getting out of the pool.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.067
A sex dream
about Ang Lee?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.468
What was that like?

14:28.568 --> 14:35.175
A little slow-paced
but visually stunning.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.310
Here.
Drink your protein drink.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.346
I'm gonna be at Vince's
again tonight.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.880
We're gonna stay in
and...

14:40.981 --> 14:43.550
be slow-paced
but visually stunning.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.585
You know what?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.520
I hate
these protein shakes.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.489
So does every gay man
in this city,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.424
but, like you, we drink them
for somebody

14:51.524 --> 14:53.360
much younger than we are
who we hope one day

14:53.460 --> 14:54.527
will look at us
with adoring eyes.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.363
Here.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.299
Sorry, I'm not drinking it.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.568
Okay, I guess this
is the first time

15:01.668 --> 15:04.237
I'm going to have
to use the red marker

15:04.337 --> 15:06.539
on the chart.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.411
You know what?

15:11.511 --> 15:15.048
This isn't working
for me.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.684
I'm tired of you constantly
hovering over me

15:17.784 --> 15:19.319
and watching
my every move.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.388
So, you know,
it's my baby.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.522
I think I know what's best.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.357
I never said
I know what's best.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.492
I'm just trying to help.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.559
Yeah, and I'm just saying
that maybe

15:26.659 --> 15:27.494
I don't need your help.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.964
Oh, okay.
I know what this is.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.232
I've been charting
your progesterone

15:32.332 --> 15:35.335
and you are spiking.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.503
Will, you're not
the president.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.972
Get out of my uterus.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.209
I'm going to class.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.676
Wait for me.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.579
No, I don't need a partner.
I can do this alone.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.551
(Karen)
Felicia...

15:51.651 --> 15:54.287
Mr. Stanley will be
moving out of the manse.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.324
His arms and chest
will be leaving today.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.430
The rest of him
should be out by tomorrow.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.101
Hey, Kare.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.604
Oh, well,
look who's here.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.706
Shouldn't you be
making TV love to a woman

16:13.806 --> 16:16.743
while holding down vomit?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.478
Karen, please talk to me.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.712
I wanna know
what's going on with you.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.481
No, you don't.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.483
And you wouldn't be able
to hear it anyway.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.653
Okay.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.222
Then will you help me
rehearse my next scene?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.223
No, Jack.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.224
Forget it.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.692
I am too busy.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.693
Please, Karen?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.095
It's an important
monologue,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.530
and I really think
you should hear it.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.332
Fine.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.101
But make it snappy.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.236
While packing his things,
three maids got tangled

16:43.336 --> 16:44.604
in Stan's pajama bottoms,

16:44.704 --> 16:47.540
and I've gotta
go cut them out.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.576
Okay.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.579
We've been friends
for a long time, Darren.

16:52.679 --> 16:57.050
And I let you down today.
Darren.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.253
I should have been there
for you, but I got

17:00.353 --> 17:01.454
so wrapped up
in my own stuff,

17:01.554 --> 17:02.622
that I just didn't listen.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.726
I'm sorry it's over
between you and...

17:06.826 --> 17:09.329
Franley.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.600
And I know things
seem really scary for you,

17:13.700 --> 17:16.503
but you're a strong woman,
Darren.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.371
And you're gonna
come out of this okay.

17:18.471 --> 17:23.376
And I'll be there for you
for anything you need.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.479
Darren...

17:26.579 --> 17:30.683
During your break-up
with Franley.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.721
I'm Jack.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.756
Come on.

17:36.856 --> 17:37.757
You call that writing?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.127
Those Jews
should stick to comedy.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.167
Karen, didn't you hear
a word I just said?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.601
Of course I did, honey.

17:48.701 --> 17:53.206
I may be a pill-popping,
jet fuel sniffing,

17:53.306 --> 17:55.675
gin-soaked narcissist.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.113
But I'm not an actor.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.482
I listen
when people speak.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.553
Hey, what are you
doing here?

18:06.653 --> 18:07.554
Grace said
you weren't coming.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.788
I didn't ask her why,

18:08.888 --> 18:10.823
'cause I saw the way
her levels were spiking

18:10.923 --> 18:11.824
on your graph.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.992
What are you doing out here?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.695
Sheila's been in the bathroom
for, like, half an hour.

18:15.795 --> 18:16.829
Oh!

18:16.929 --> 18:21.301
Haul it out here,
trailer park.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.271
(Sheila)
Shut up, greaseball!
My water broke.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.372
Oh, geez.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.274
All right,
visualize your breath.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.309
And put out
that cigarette!

18:32.312 --> 18:34.614
Hey.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.848
What are you doing here?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.384
I didn't want you
walking home alone.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.352
Someone just
got killed in this city.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.689
They're calling it the
"Could be anybody" killer.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.824
I know, it was Vince's turn
to name the killer

18:44.924 --> 18:45.858
and that's what
he comes up with.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.594
Here, let me help.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.561
Really, Will,
I've got it.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.730
No, I wanna help.
I don't want your help.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.732
Well, you're gonna
get it anyway.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.267
Now look what you did!

18:54.367 --> 18:55.802
We're supposed
to treat these

18:55.902 --> 18:56.769
like they're real babies.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.740
Well, calm down.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.808
I'm sure
a real baby's head

19:01.908 --> 19:04.511
wouldn't come off
quite so easily.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.145
I told you
I could do it myself.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.314
But you don't have to.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.648
You don't have to do
any of this yourself.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.150
You have me.
No, I don't.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.419
I mean, yes, right now

19:12.519 --> 19:14.454
during the course
of this class I do.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.922
But once that baby comes,
I'm on my own.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.190
It's just me.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.227
You're starting
a whole new life with Vince,

19:20.327 --> 19:21.561
and that's great.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.563
And Leo's starting
a whole new life

19:23.663 --> 19:25.232
with his fiancée,
and that sucks.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.533
But you know what?

19:26.633 --> 19:27.834
There's nothing I can do
about it.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.269
So I have to be realistic.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.471
If I am going
to have to raise this...

19:32.439 --> 19:36.709
headless torso
by myself, then I really...

19:37.877 --> 19:41.348
I need to start
getting used to it now.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.516
Grace, after all
we've been through,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.552
do you really think
that I wouldn't

19:45.652 --> 19:47.554
be there for you
after this baby is born?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.756
Of course I'll be there
for you.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.957
Don't say it
like it's so easy.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.359
This is so much bigger
than anything

19:52.459 --> 19:53.426
we have ever been through.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.601
Listen to me.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.270
I already love this baby

20:03.370 --> 20:05.738
more than
I could have imagined.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.808
And if you want me to,

20:08.908 --> 20:12.912
I'll be there
for the whole thing.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.715
From diapers to college.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.850
Which, quite frankly,
I already assumed

20:17.950 --> 20:19.752
I'd be paying for.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.792
You really mean that?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.561
It would be an honor.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.966
So we're gonna...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.902
We're gonna
do this together?

20:36.002 --> 20:38.237
We already are.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.350
I'm really sorry, Karen.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.751
I wish I had
been there for you.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.686
Honey, it's okay.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.723
It's just important
that you're here for me now.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.596
Now, if you'll
excuse me, honey.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.264
I'm gonna go
take some of those pills

21:05.365 --> 21:07.434
I've been stealing
from Grace.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.669
Gosh, my nails are stronger,
my hair is thicker,

21:09.769 --> 21:12.439
but I think my balls
may be shrinking.

21:12.539 --> 21:12.639
