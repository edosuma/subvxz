00:01.380 --> 00:03.850
Previously on Enterprise.

00:04.370 --> 00:06.850
We're in bad shape.
I can't deny that.

00:06.950 --> 00:09.170
Perhaps my crew can help.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.780
My emotions are growing more difficult to control.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.570
You used trellium for three months.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.850
You may have to learn to live with these emotions.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.230
These are the coordinates for the council chamber.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.670
It'll take us weeks to get there.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.120
It's a shorter route, a subspace corridor.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.080
I'll meet you at the far end in three days.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.780
See you in three days.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:38.360 --> 00:39.940
Come in.

00:45.550 --> 00:46.450
The probe...?

00:46.790 --> 00:49.220
We couldn't stop it from entering the vortex.

00:49.270 --> 00:51.520
It's on its way to Earth.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.780
Seven million people...

00:53.870 --> 00:55.960
Everything is happening as it did before.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.380
Then you have no choice.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.410
You must find Jonathan Archer.

02:36.610 --> 02:37.800
Come in.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.170
I'm sorry to bother you.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.560
I'm having a little trouble falling asleep.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.740
I think my insomnia's come back.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.230
You're here for neuro-pressure.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.980
It's been weeks since our last session.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.800
We've all been under a lot of stress lately.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.820
I thought it might do us both some good.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.770
I think we should discontinue these treatments.

03:00.370 --> 03:01.280
Why?

03:01.890 --> 03:05.560
You've become quite skilled
with the postures I've shown you.

03:06.660 --> 03:09.200
You told me it takes years to master neuro-pressure.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.420
I'm not that quick a study...

03:10.420 --> 03:12.320
I've taught you all I can.

03:14.830 --> 03:15.320
Look...

03:22.840 --> 03:25.930
...the truth is I'm sleeping fine.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.400
I didn't come for neuro-pressure.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.720
I came because I'm worried about you.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.720
Worried.

03:33.950 --> 03:37.090
You've been keeping to yourself a lot lately,
even more than usual.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.940
You spend every free moment in your quarters.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.830
You even asked Chef to bring your meals here.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.830
The Mess Hall's heavily damaged.
Where would you suggest I eat?

03:46.280 --> 03:47.170
Come on,...

03:48.260 --> 03:53.570
you gotta admit you've been avoiding me
ever since the two of us...

03:55.080 --> 03:56.570
You know, when we...

03:57.220 --> 03:59.150
Had sexual relations.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.340
Wow, that's real romantic
when you put it that way.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.300
I told you what happened was an exploration,

04:07.440 --> 04:09.870
not the prelude to an intimate relationship.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.620
I never said I wanted a relationship.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.030
Neither did I.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.140
You helped me get through a rough patch
and I'm grateful.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.190
I just stopped by to see if I could return the favor.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.390
I appreciate your concern.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.910
But I'm fine.

04:46.190 --> 04:49.860
Degra said these Kovaalans had only
one or two ships inside the nebula.

04:50.130 --> 04:53.100
It would appear that his information is out of date.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.450
There are at least half a dozen ships.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.980
According to Degra, they're not very tolerant of trespassers.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.980
How close are they to the corridor?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.970
Within 60,000 kilometers.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.970
We'll ionize the hull.

05:11.490 --> 05:13.970
That should mask our approach for a while.

05:14.670 --> 05:18.240
I suggest we enter here
above this layer of metreon gas.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.630
It should reflect our engine signature,...

05:20.630 --> 05:23.290
create multiple sensor ghosts, false readings...

05:23.670 --> 05:27.090
if we're lucky, they won't know which one to fire at.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.230
You gave them the coordinates?!

05:34.320 --> 05:35.950
They could launch an attack against the Council!

05:35.950 --> 05:37.860
Archer's ship was heavily damaged.

05:37.860 --> 05:40.730
They wouldn't stand a chance against
one of our cruisers.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.410
There may be other human ships in the Expanse.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.670
Those readings were never confirmed.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.930
This discussion is pointless.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.580
You won't be allowed to bring Archer
before the Council.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.100
Then we won't ask their permission.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.100
He'll be killed the moment he steps
into the Council chamber.

05:55.130 --> 05:59.640
They have to listen.
His allegations are too important to simply dismiss.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.640
Do you believe Archer's being truthful?

06:03.460 --> 06:05.920
I don't think he's told us everything, but...

06:06.100 --> 06:08.630
I can't explain the evidence that we saw.

06:08.630 --> 06:11.000
The humans could have manufactured this evidence.

06:11.090 --> 06:12.740
They'd do anything to save their planet.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.830
If Archer is telling the truth, ...

06:15.440 --> 06:19.270
then all the Council's efforts will be for nothing.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.320
The Reptilians patrol this side of the corridor.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.910
They'll destroy the human vessel
as soon as it comes through.

06:26.910 --> 06:28.490
I've already considered that.

06:28.490 --> 06:30.840
We can protect them.

06:31.130 --> 06:34.130
What makes you think the Reptilians won't fire on us?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.710
Tactical alert.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.730
Take us in.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.090
Aye, sir.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.070
A ship is dropping out of warp.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.440
-Can you identify it?
- This can't be right.

06:57.530 --> 06:58.980
T'Pol?

06:59.910 --> 07:02.350
It's Starfleet NX class.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.540
Are you sure it's not a sensor reflection?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.670
We haven't entered the nebula yet.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.990
Whoever they are, they're on an intercept course.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.070
We're within visual range.

07:15.890 --> 07:18.250
Must be the NX-02 Columbia.

07:18.890 --> 07:20.670
It's still under construction.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.760
I don't think that's Columbia.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.950
We're being hailed.

07:35.980 --> 07:39.520
Captain Archer, you must reverse course immediately.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.850
-Who are you?
- There's no time to explain.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.020
Alter your heading.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.150
Come about, Ensign.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.610
Would you tell me what the hell is going on?

08:05.640 --> 08:06.990
Your weapons won't be necessary.

08:07.110 --> 08:08.810
I'd like some answers first.

08:09.370 --> 08:12.570
I'm Lorian, commander of Enterprise.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.570
Karyn Archer, my First Officer.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.570
We should find a place to talk.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.960
Perhaps the Conference Room.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.600
You'll want T'Pol to join us.

08:38.370 --> 08:41.309
You can't take your ship
into the subspace corridor.

08:41.460 --> 08:45.530
If you do, it'll be thrown back
in time 117 years.

08:46.010 --> 08:47.290
How would you know that?

08:47.370 --> 08:49.440
Because it's already happened.

08:49.970 --> 08:53.370
We're here to make certain
that history doesn't repeat itself.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.400
The Kovaalans attacked Enterprise
as soon as it entered the nebula.

08:59.180 --> 09:00.400
Phase-cannons are off-line.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.830
Torpedoes, full spread.

09:03.050 --> 09:04.620
How long until we reach the corridor?

09:04.690 --> 09:07.120
18 seconds.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.080
Aft plating's gone.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.070
We're losing speed.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.390
Hold your course.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.790
The trip through the corridor took only a few seconds.

09:27.950 --> 09:31.140
It didn't take long before your crew realized
something was wrong.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.100
No sign of pursuit.

09:35.390 --> 09:39.720
-Where are we?
-We've traveled 11.6 light years.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.310
Degra?

09:46.060 --> 09:47.850
Nothing on long- range sensors.

09:47.850 --> 09:48.670
Captain.

09:48.890 --> 09:50.190
The stars...

09:51.180 --> 09:53.370
they're not where they're supposed to be.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.330
Are you sure we're at the right coordinates?

09:58.730 --> 09:59.860
Yes.

10:00.980 --> 10:05.590
Enterprise was in the right place,
but it was over a hundred years early.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.680
We're not entirely sure why this happened,
but we have a theory.

10:10.230 --> 10:15.160
We think your impulse wake destabilized the corridor,
causing it to shift in time.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.570
Why didn't you...

10:21.440 --> 10:24.880
didn't we go back through it?

10:25.100 --> 10:26.860
T'Pol eventually determined ...

10:26.860 --> 10:30.610
that ships can only travel through
this corridor in one direction.

10:30.870 --> 10:32.200
I'll notify the crew.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.020
Let Travis know we'll be getting under way.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.400
What course should we set?

10:39.280 --> 10:42.390
Even if we could find a way to get out of the Expanse,
we can't go back to Earth.

10:42.920 --> 10:50.060
We'd be contaminating
our own culture, our own history...

10:50.450 --> 10:54.100
Cochrane's warp flight won't happen for another 26 years.

10:56.450 --> 11:01.320
Maybe there's a way we can use this
to our advantage.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.790
How?

11:04.090 --> 11:09.100
We know the date
when Earth is attacked by the first Xindi probe.

11:11.310 --> 11:13.700
We may be able to figure out a way...

11:13.790 --> 11:17.470
to warn them or even prevent the attack.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.170
The probe won't be deployed
for more than a hundred years

11:22.210 --> 11:25.910
Your crew realized it would be their descendants
who would have to complete this mission.

11:26.430 --> 11:29.000
It was only a matter of time
before the first child was born.

11:29.660 --> 11:32.280
Enterprise became a "generational ship."

11:32.440 --> 11:35.620
You showed your children how to operate
and maintain its systems,...

11:35.660 --> 11:37.880
and they did the same for their children.

11:38.020 --> 11:42.500
You've been flying around the Expanse
for over a century?

11:44.130 --> 11:45.500
That's unlikely.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.040
Enterprise doesn't have fuel or
provisions for such a long journey.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.040
You've hardly changed, Mother.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.200
I beg your pardon?

11:56.170 --> 11:58.200
You made alliances with other species,...

11:58.330 --> 12:01.080
traded technology for food and supplies.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.670
You even acquired a few alien crew members.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.780
We did our best to carry out
the mission you gave us, Captain.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.780
To destroy the first Xindi probe.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.530
But you failed.

12:15.330 --> 12:20.290
We had years to prepare, but in the end,
we were only one starship.

12:20.590 --> 12:22.590
Our weapons were no match for the Xindi.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.840
We couldn't stop the first attack,
but we can help you stop the second.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.500
We can make certain you reach the rendezvous
with Degra this time.

12:30.730 --> 12:32.970
You said we couldn't travel through the corridor.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.320
You won't need to.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.840
We've encountered dozens of species.

12:37.030 --> 12:39.450
Some of them shared their propulsion technology with us.

12:39.650 --> 12:42.230
We got these schematics from Haradin traders.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.610
We can use them to modify
your injector assembly.

12:44.610 --> 12:47.960
You'll be able to travel at
warp 6.9 for brief intervals.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.400
The hull wasn't designed for that speed.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.690
We'll show you how to reinforce structural integrity.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.710
You'll be able to reach Degra
in less than two days.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.930
You've made these modifications on your own ship?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.350
Our plasma injectors are too old,
they can't handle the stress.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.350
But your injectors are practically new.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.960
You're still not convinced.

13:10.370 --> 13:13.350
You've got to admit it's a lot to accept.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.590
We don't have a lot of time.

13:15.890 --> 13:18.130
You need to start these modifications.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.860
I'm not comfortable doing that just yet.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.860
Perhaps we should go to Sick Bay.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.860
Phlox can confirm our identity.

13:28.490 --> 13:30.330
They are who they claim to be.

13:30.780 --> 13:34.130
Most of the young woman's ancestors
were human but there are also ...

13:34.270 --> 13:37.200
chromosomes from three species I've never seen before.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.950
These genetic markers belong to you, Captain.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.350
She would appear to be your great-granddaughter.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.770
I've compared your genetic profile with Lorian's.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.190
These base pair sequences could only
have come from you.

13:53.590 --> 13:56.010
These chromosomes are human.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.810
That's correct.
They came from his father.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.670
That's impossible.

14:02.390 --> 14:05.340
Humans and Vulcans have never been able to reproduce.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.530
According to Lorian, I discovered...

14:08.430 --> 14:09.870
or rather, I will discover....

14:09.870 --> 14:13.440
a method of successfully combining
human and Vulcan genomes.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.170
Who's the father?

14:16.270 --> 14:17.340
Commander Tucker.

14:23.270 --> 14:25.060
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

14:25.230 --> 14:29.150
I've decided to proceed with Lorian's plan
to modify our warp engines.

14:29.310 --> 14:32.150
Both ships have moved a safe distance
from the nebula ...

14:32.150 --> 14:34.660
to avoid conflict with the Kovaalans.

14:34.660 --> 14:35.760
It's the strangest thing.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.150
I look at you and I see my father.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.650
Right here, around the eyes.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.070
Now, the ears, those, those are your mother's.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.430
Wait a minute. You smiled.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.010
I wasn't raised with the same inhibitions
most Vulcans have.

14:58.730 --> 15:03.120
My human side has allowed me to find
a balance between emotion and logic.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.160
I've even been known to tell a joke on occasion.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.120
Would you hand me the coil spanner?

15:15.310 --> 15:18.590
You seem to know your way around an injector assembly.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.710
Pretty dry reading.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.650
I hope I gave you some hands-on training as well.

15:26.870 --> 15:28.500
I'm sure you would have.

15:30.980 --> 15:34.650
We should reinitialize the startup routine
before going to warp six.

15:38.010 --> 15:40.380
There's something you're not telling me.

15:43.990 --> 15:47.540
You died when I was 14.

15:51.270 --> 15:52.590
What happened?

15:53.200 --> 15:55.920
I'm not sure we should be discussing your future.

15:59.390 --> 16:03.160
It couldn't have been easy growing up
without the old man around.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.160
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

16:07.690 --> 16:09.750
You were a good father.

16:12.070 --> 16:16.020
It's strange being able to tell you that.

16:24.230 --> 16:27.080
We've doubled the efficiency of
our atmosphere processors.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.920
We can give you those specs, too.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.170
Starfleet will be glad to hear Enterprise was built to last.

16:37.750 --> 16:38.840
Thanks.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.840
Wasn't that boy Denobulan?

16:42.210 --> 16:44.790
Many of our crew are descendants of Phlox.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.260
He and Amanda had nine children.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.880
You're not entirely human yourself.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.500
My great-grandmother was Ikaaran.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.700
-Was that...?
- Your wife.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.040
Her name was Esilia.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.040
You rescued her ship from an anomaly field.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.750
You know, finding your ship explains a few things.

17:10.369 --> 17:11.630
When the Xindi took me prisoner,....

17:11.630 --> 17:14.210
they asked me one question over and over.
They wanted to know ....

17:14.550 --> 17:16.930
how many ships Starfleet had in the Expanse.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.099
I'm sure they've picked us up
on their sensors more than once.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.619
I thought we were going to the Bridge.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.900
There's someone who'd like to see you first.

17:41.410 --> 17:44.080
Hello, Jonathan.

17:45.020 --> 17:45.990
T'Pol.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.060
It's good to see you.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.850
Living with humans for so long has changed you.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.640
They didn't tell me you were still aboard.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.470
You mean "still alive."

18:17.970 --> 18:19.330
You look well.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.860
How is Trip?

18:24.650 --> 18:25.860
He's fine.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.020
If you'd like, I'll have him come by and say hello.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.970
That might be awkward.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.450
There's so much I want to ask you.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.300
I don't know where to start.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.830
I wish we had time to get reacquainted.

18:44.660 --> 18:47.430
You must give this to your Science Officer.

18:49.090 --> 18:50.840
She'll know what it means.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.590
Two: A boy and a girl.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.540
Toru and Yoshiko.

18:57.540 --> 18:58.860
Who's the father?

18:58.860 --> 18:59.860
I don't know.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.370
It was probably in their database,
but I didn't look it up.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.370
-Why not?
-You've got to be curious.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.470
Some things are better left a mystery.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.300
How about you?
Did you get married?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.090
Corporal McKenzie.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.480
A MACO.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.300
How well do you know her?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.430
We talked after a training session once.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.400
-Yeah?
-You should ask her out.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.880
-Is this taken?
-Please.

19:24.620 --> 19:27.020
So, Lieutenant, who did you end up with?

19:27.020 --> 19:28.510
On the other Enterprise.

19:28.740 --> 19:30.930
Did you get married, have kids?

19:32.210 --> 19:33.930
no.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.340
Actually, I didn't.

19:36.480 --> 19:41.740
Apparently, the Reed family line came
to a rather unceremonious end.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.870
You'd think on a ship quite this size
I would've been able to find someone.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.430
Women only make up a third of the crew.

19:52.570 --> 19:55.150
There were bound to be a few bachelors left over.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.540
Yeah.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.280
It would appear I'm going to be one of them.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.330
I'm on duty in a few minutes.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.610
Me, too.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.500
I'll see you later, sir.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.080
This seat's available.

20:19.490 --> 20:21.950
She thinks that Lorian's plan won't work.

20:22.940 --> 20:25.600
T'Pol found a discrepancy in his calculations.

20:26.710 --> 20:31.980
If we exceed warp 5.6,
the injectors could start to overload.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.580
We'd be destroyed.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.050
Have you shown that to Trip?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.050
He agrees with the assessment.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.340
We'll have to contact Degra.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.100
Tell him we won't be able to make the rendezvous.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.200
There is an alternative.

21:01.870 --> 21:03.320
The subspace corridor.

21:04.010 --> 21:05.450
We'll be thrown back in time.

21:05.450 --> 21:07.130
Not necessarily.

21:07.950 --> 21:09.130
T'Pol spent ...

21:09.190 --> 21:12.340
many years examining their sensor logs
from the incident.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.640
She believes it's possible
to reconfigure our impulse manifolds.

21:18.790 --> 21:21.470
It should prevent the corridor from destabilizing.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.720
-How long will it take?
- About 12 hours.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.180
You should've told me.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.160
My ship could be destroyed.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.580
There's only a 22% chance of an overload.

21:39.130 --> 21:41.210
I'd call that a damn big risk.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.500
There's no alternative.

21:43.930 --> 21:46.600
You'll be thrown into the past if
you try to use the corridor.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.210
I've got two T'Pol's who disagree with you.

21:49.290 --> 21:52.600
The Kovaalans will attack
Enterprise the moment it enters the nebula.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.150
If they damage your manifolds,
the corridor will destabilize again.

21:56.150 --> 21:57.360
It's our best option.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.700
You have to listen to me.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.710
This is my mission...

22:01.110 --> 22:02.410
and my decision.

22:02.410 --> 22:04.830
Saving Earth is my mission as much as yours.

22:04.830 --> 22:07.200
I didn't come over here for a debate.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.660
I've already given the order.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.300
Trip's shorthanded in Engineering.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.490
If you could spare a few people,
he could get the work done faster.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.610
You're the captain.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.810
You shouldn't have spoken to Archer.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.310
He had a right to know the risks.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.400
Why didn't you tell him?

22:30.440 --> 22:32.890
If they use that corridor, their mission will fail.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.410
Earth will be destroyed.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.900
You're allowing your human side
to get the better of you.

22:38.740 --> 22:41.190
You know nothing about being human.

22:44.270 --> 22:46.410
I know that for them, ...

22:46.700 --> 22:50.350
guilt can be a powerful motivator.

22:50.420 --> 22:53.350
Don't let it cloud your judgment.

22:55.070 --> 23:00.450
Maybe you'd be a little more concerned
if Vulcan was in danger and not Earth.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.310
We'll meet with Degra.

23:04.310 --> 23:05.820
I'll speak to the Xindi council.

23:05.870 --> 23:07.550
Degra's not expecting us.

23:07.590 --> 23:10.550
Archer's following the same course of action
he did before.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.500
He's not going to be at the rendezvous.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.300
But their plan could work.

23:14.300 --> 23:17.020
We can't just sit here and hope he succeeds.

23:17.380 --> 23:20.020
Billions of lives are at stake.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.500
H-How are we supposed to reach Degra?

23:22.500 --> 23:24.030
We can't sustain warp six.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.720
Our injectors are too old.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.720
We're going to use the injectors from Archer's ship.

23:28.910 --> 23:31.470
Do you expect him to simply give them to us?

23:32.140 --> 23:33.260
No.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.260
You're going to steal them?

23:36.420 --> 23:38.260
Their warp drive will be disabled.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.180
My father's a resourceful engineer.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.360
He'll be able to fabricate new injectors.

23:42.360 --> 23:45.430
You're asking me to betray Jonathan Archer.

23:45.870 --> 23:47.610
I know this won't be easy, ...

23:47.610 --> 23:50.340
but we've had to make difficult choices before.

23:51.110 --> 23:54.330
Our parents and grandparents lived and died aboard this ship...

23:54.330 --> 23:58.010
to ensure that someday,
we would be able to stop the Xindi.

23:58.010 --> 23:59.930
This is our time.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.560
If Earth is going to survive, we have to act.

24:07.950 --> 24:10.210
Have you spent any time talking to Lorian?

24:10.540 --> 24:11.710
Not really.

24:12.230 --> 24:12.990
You should.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.560
He seems like a good kid.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.560
He's hardly a "kid."
He's more than a hundred years old.

24:20.470 --> 24:21.950
Only in the Expanse...

24:22.030 --> 24:25.240
could I have a son who's nearly three times my age.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.000
Who would've thought, you and me, huh?

24:32.940 --> 24:36.510
Lorian says we're going to be married
in a traditional Vulcan ceremony.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.510
It's gonna take me weeks
to learn to pronounce the vows.

24:40.830 --> 24:42.510
You know where we're going
to have our honeymoon?

24:42.740 --> 24:44.720
Cargo Bay Three!

24:44.950 --> 24:49.120
He says I'll fill it up with sand that
we dug up from a passing asteroid.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.330
I'm even supposed to...

24:52.010 --> 24:55.000
I'm even supposed manufacture a palm tree.

24:56.110 --> 24:59.450
It's ridiculous to assume
those events are going to happen.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.110
Hand me the flux coupler.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.150
Aren't you at all curious ...

25:06.440 --> 25:09.220
about how you and I are supposed to end up together?

25:12.680 --> 25:15.800
The fact that our counterparts married doesn't mean
we'll do the same.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.040
You're afraid to admit that under the right circumstances, ...

25:19.040 --> 25:20.990
you could have feelings for me.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.230
Maybe you have them already.

25:23.740 --> 25:25.410
I should've known this was a mistake.

25:26.110 --> 25:26.840
What?

25:28.090 --> 25:30.250
Exploring human sexuality with you.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.710
You're obviously unable to have...

25:32.710 --> 25:35.990
a physical relationship without developing
an emotional attachment.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.330
You know, all the other women on board
must've been taken...

25:39.170 --> 25:41.960
'cause I can't imagine any other reason
why I would've married someone ....

25:42.000 --> 25:44.340
as stubborn as you.

25:44.790 --> 25:46.960
I'll go help Rostov with the port manifold.

25:48.060 --> 25:51.040
You seem to have everything under control.

26:03.450 --> 26:05.140
The injectors are still on line.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.030
Greer? How much longer?

26:08.070 --> 26:10.490
It's taking more time than we thought
to reroute the plasma.

26:10.490 --> 26:11.800
Stand by.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.790
Hold off on it for now.

26:13.790 --> 26:16.000
I want those starboard modules recalibrated first.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.270
Hold your fire!

26:18.270 --> 26:19.570
What the hell are you doing?!

26:19.570 --> 26:20.800
Greer to Lorian.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.480
The flow's been diverted.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.050
Get back to the ship.

26:24.290 --> 26:25.460
Go.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.500
We won't be able to go to warp without those injectors!

26:28.500 --> 26:30.380
Archer gave me no other option.

26:32.060 --> 26:34.100
Take some advice from your old man:

26:34.200 --> 26:35.990
you don't want to do this.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.700
He'll alert the others.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.260
I'm sorry.

26:45.890 --> 26:47.020
What's wrong?

26:47.020 --> 26:48.810
Warp engines just went off-line.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.300
Our plasma injectors are disengaged.

26:53.790 --> 26:55.300
Archer to Engineering.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.310
Trip, respond.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.310
Send a security team.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.410
They've undocked.

27:04.410 --> 27:05.880
Hail them.

27:08.450 --> 27:09.690
No response.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.280
They're preparing to go to warp!

27:12.670 --> 27:14.310
Disable their engines.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.720
-They're targeting our nacelles.
-Take us to warp!

27:25.650 --> 27:28.370
I can't they've knocked out
the starboard power couplings!

27:28.370 --> 27:30.180
Get us out of here, full impulse!

27:30.230 --> 27:31.710
Return fire!

27:35.040 --> 27:36.520
Hull plating at 61%!

27:36.830 --> 27:38.780
-They're making a run for it!
- Stay with them!

27:40.760 --> 27:42.920
They have the same complement of weapons as we do.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.230
We would appear to be evenly matched.

27:47.060 --> 27:49.560
Get down to the transporter and stand by.

28:00.630 --> 28:03.230
Bring us in low, underneath them.

28:04.170 --> 28:06.380
Target their hull plating relays.

28:13.030 --> 28:14.540
We've lost hull plating!

28:15.300 --> 28:16.040
T'Pol?

28:16.230 --> 28:17.590
I can't establish a lock.

28:17.930 --> 28:18.960
We need to get closer.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.200
You heard her!

28:21.870 --> 28:23.600
We lost power on C-Deck.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.600
Weapons are gone.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.360
2,000 meters.

28:28.830 --> 28:29.730
T'Pol!

28:35.900 --> 28:38.680
Sir, our weapons are losing power.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.100
Archer's using the transporter.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.270
They've taken one of our EPS manifolds!

28:42.320 --> 28:44.820
Now lock on to their primary relays.

28:45.010 --> 28:47.520
They're on C-Deck, junction twelve.

28:47.740 --> 28:49.280
Acknowledged.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.680
We're losing main power.

29:01.690 --> 29:02.830
This is Captain Archer.

29:03.750 --> 29:06.530
Looks like we've got some things
that belong to each other.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.520
Why don't we call a truce....

29:09.990 --> 29:12.830
and return our respective property.

29:13.230 --> 29:17.160
Sir, they still have one torpedo
in the forward tube.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.620
It's locked on to our starboard engine.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.710
I know you've got your finger on the trigger.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.860
If you fire that torpedo, ...

29:28.250 --> 29:30.860
you're going to hurt a lot of people over here.

29:32.950 --> 29:33.860
Lorian...

29:35.140 --> 29:36.730
answer me!

29:38.590 --> 29:40.330
We can't do this.

29:40.670 --> 29:42.090
There's too much at stake.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.090
These people are family.

29:46.730 --> 29:49.590
I'm not going to let you kill them.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.260
Captain...

29:55.180 --> 29:56.340
it's over.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.120
Stand down weapons.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.030
Tell Archer I want to talk.

30:31.570 --> 30:32.940
You were lucky.

30:34.030 --> 30:36.710
Phlox says the injuries on both ships were minor.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.710
You almost crippled us.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.270
My mission would've been over.

30:41.270 --> 30:42.880
Your mission is over, Captain.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.970
You just won't accept it.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.970
I took the only logical course of action.

30:48.470 --> 30:52.750
Attacking your ancestors doesn't sound very
"logical" to me.

30:54.630 --> 30:56.360
You wouldn't understand.

30:57.130 --> 30:58.440
You can't.

30:59.170 --> 31:03.710
You don't know what it's like
living with the responsibility.

31:05.150 --> 31:07.980
Millions of people are dead because of me.

31:08.370 --> 31:11.360
I'm sure your crew did everything
they could to stop the probe...

31:11.360 --> 31:13.300
I could've destroyed it!

31:15.570 --> 31:16.710
Years ago, I...

31:16.820 --> 31:19.710
I swore to my Captain on his deathbed, ...

31:19.850 --> 31:22.340
I'd save those seven million lives.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.590
You were the man I made that promise to.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.320
I devoted my life to that mission.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.900
We knew the coordinates of the launch platform, ...

31:31.900 --> 31:34.400
the exact minute the weapon was going to be deployed.

31:34.790 --> 31:36.410
But our plan didn't work.

31:36.710 --> 31:38.530
I had one last chance.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.860
Use Enterprise itself-- set a collision course with the probe.

31:43.210 --> 31:44.860
But I hesitated.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.030
My emotions took over.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.830
I couldn't give an order that would kill my crew.

31:54.450 --> 31:56.820
By the time I realized my mistake,
it was too late.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.440
The probe was gone.

32:01.370 --> 32:04.270
I won't let my emotions get in the way again.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.840
I will not let Earth be destroyed.

32:21.790 --> 32:23.710
I could keep you locked up in here,...

32:24.950 --> 32:27.030
but that wouldn't do either of us any good.

32:29.430 --> 32:33.760
All that matters
is what we're going to do next.

32:34.350 --> 32:36.180
Whether you agree with it or not,...

32:36.180 --> 32:38.620
I'm taking my ship into that corridor ...

32:39.920 --> 32:43.160
and I'll stand a much better chance
of completing this mission--

32:44.680 --> 32:46.160
our mission--

32:47.120 --> 32:48.500
if we work together.

32:53.710 --> 32:54.880
Come in.

33:05.390 --> 33:08.440
-Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.880
Please.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.100
Tea?

33:19.100 --> 33:21.340
-Chamomile?
- Of course.

33:25.310 --> 33:28.870
We had trouble with your modifications.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.670
We were only able to reduce
our particle wake by 86%.

33:34.670 --> 33:36.830
The corridor could destabilize again.

33:36.830 --> 33:41.850
If you place an isomagnetic collector here, ....

33:42.840 --> 33:46.540
it should absorb any residual particles.

33:47.940 --> 33:50.580
I'm not familiar with that type of device.

33:51.110 --> 33:54.350
It's something we picked up
from the Ikaarans.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.850
I should be able to find the schematics.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.840
Are you feeling better?

34:04.430 --> 34:05.550
What do you mean?

34:05.550 --> 34:07.780
Your trellium addiction.

34:08.730 --> 34:10.550
Have the symptoms diminished?

34:12.040 --> 34:13.550
To a degree.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.900
But I haven't fully recovered.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.560
You'll never fully recover.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.469
The emotions you've accessed...

34:25.540 --> 34:28.670
will be with you the rest of your life.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.460
Here we are.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.030
Don't forget your tea.

34:40.090 --> 34:43.070
You're going to have to learn to embrace them...

34:43.780 --> 34:46.360
live with them, as I have.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.710
There's someone on your ship who can help.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.420
Phlox has already given me a neural suppressant.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.170
I don't mean Phlox.

34:58.850 --> 34:59.820
Trip...

35:00.400 --> 35:03.000
can be an outlet for these feelings.

35:04.340 --> 35:06.260
If you'll trust him.

35:06.550 --> 35:11.290
The emotions he stirred in me were powerful...

35:12.480 --> 35:13.640
and frightening.

35:15.010 --> 35:16.970
I tried to push him away.

35:17.470 --> 35:21.260
If Enterprise hadn't been stranded in the past, ...

35:21.380 --> 35:25.990
it's possible I never would've married Trip.

35:29.120 --> 35:34.160
But I can't imagine what
my life would have been like without him.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.720
What do you suggest I do?

35:38.480 --> 35:40.970
There's a human expression.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.540
"Follow your heart."

35:46.070 --> 35:49.070
What if my "heart" doesn't know what it wants?

35:49.980 --> 35:51.020
It will,

35:53.290 --> 35:54.440
in time.

35:55.850 --> 35:57.120
It will.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.190
Weapons are standing by.

36:07.030 --> 36:09.190
Take us in.

36:18.380 --> 36:20.710
Are the signatures being reflected?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.470
I'm reading multiple images.

36:28.470 --> 36:30.740
How long until we reach the corridor?

36:31.040 --> 36:32.430
Six minutes.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.430
They've detected us.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.430
Three ships are on intercept course.

36:47.670 --> 36:49.200
Return fire!

36:49.200 --> 36:51.700
The nebula's interfering
with our targeting scanners.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.480
We'll have to wait until they get closer.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.730
They don't seem to be having the same problem.

36:57.250 --> 36:58.730
Aft plating's at 42%!

36:58.730 --> 37:01.060
-Malcolm!
- Just a few more seconds, sir.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.440
We have a lock!

37:04.440 --> 37:05.480
Archer to Lorian...

37:06.890 --> 37:08.110
now!

37:17.310 --> 37:18.480
Their lead ship's disabled.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.080
The other two are falling back.

37:20.550 --> 37:21.690
Well done, Captain.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.140
They must have been surprised when
your "reflection" turned and attacked them.

37:31.330 --> 37:32.890
Sir, we're losing speed.

37:32.890 --> 37:34.410
Tucker to the Bridge!

37:34.760 --> 37:35.540
Go ahead.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.540
That last torpedo took out the primary drive coil.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.420
I've gotta shut down the port engine!

37:40.420 --> 37:41.560
Understood.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.370
Lorian...

37:50.670 --> 37:53.980
it looks like we're not going
to be able to keep up with you.

37:55.410 --> 37:56.980
The aliens are regrouping.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.270
Four ships.

37:58.420 --> 38:00.610
Bring us a hundred meters off Archer's bow.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.710
Power the tractor emitters.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.750
Captain, tell your crew to brace themselves.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.800
We're increasing speed.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.740
They've engaged a tractor beam.

38:14.060 --> 38:15.400
Thanks for the lift.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.870
We'll see you on the other side.

38:16.870 --> 38:17.740
Sir.

38:18.220 --> 38:21.260
The Kovaalans' will be in weapons range
in less than twenty seconds.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.390
The aliens are closing.

38:25.650 --> 38:27.600
12,000 meters.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.880
10,000.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.450
Target their weapons!

38:32.020 --> 38:33.330
Hull plating's holding.

38:33.330 --> 38:35.160
What about Archer?

38:35.560 --> 38:37.360
Their aft plating's almost gone.

38:37.540 --> 38:38.750
See if we can get the aliens' attention.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.490
Torpedoes, full spread.

38:41.410 --> 38:42.750
We've lost aft plating!

38:44.140 --> 38:45.750
45 seconds to the corridor!

38:45.750 --> 38:46.920
Weapons are done.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.570
They're targeting Archer's reactor.

38:50.570 --> 38:52.480
Disengage the tractor beam.

38:52.590 --> 38:55.380
New course, 1-8-0 mark 0.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.230
We'll keep them off your back.

39:06.290 --> 39:08.530
Your momentum will carry you into the corridor.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.120
We'll follow as soon as we can.

39:13.210 --> 39:16.020
Tell my parents that I'll see them soon.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.630
12 seconds to the corridor.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.070
Direct hit!

39:24.070 --> 39:25.820
The pylons are starting to buckle!

39:25.820 --> 39:27.620
Reserve power to hull plating!

39:34.990 --> 39:36.900
Hull integrity's failing!

39:40.440 --> 39:42.330
Forward launchers are gone!

39:44.480 --> 39:47.080
Divert everything to the phase-cannons!

39:47.800 --> 39:49.850
Continue firing!

40:05.650 --> 40:07.330
No sign of pursuit.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.800
Where are we?

40:10.910 --> 40:13.320
We've traveled 11.6 light years.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.780
Are we still in the right century?

40:19.240 --> 40:21.600
The stars are where they're supposed to be.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.760
What about Lorian?

40:26.020 --> 40:27.410
No sign of them yet, sir.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.740
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.530
It's been five hours, ...

40:34.530 --> 40:36.810
and the other Enterprise still hasn't arrived.

40:37.460 --> 40:40.110
Repairs to our impulse drive are underway.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.450
One ship against four.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.910
It's unlikely they survived.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.790
Lorian has years of command experience.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.130
Something tells me we shouldn't write him off yet.

40:51.990 --> 40:54.390
I suppose there's another possibility.

40:56.430 --> 40:59.750
Since we weren't thrown into the past...

41:00.710 --> 41:05.340
maybe history somehow corrected itself.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.990
Are you suggesting that
the other Enterprise never existed?

41:10.300 --> 41:11.990
If you're right...

41:13.650 --> 41:15.890
then why would we remember them?

41:18.720 --> 41:20.600
Bridge to Captain Archer.

41:22.540 --> 41:23.600
Go ahead.

41:24.070 --> 41:26.060
Could you come out here, sir?

41:27.620 --> 41:29.060
A ship's dropping out of warp.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.510
It's Degra.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.550
He's hailing us.

41:36.500 --> 41:37.550
Put him up.

41:39.590 --> 41:40.550
Captain.

41:41.070 --> 41:42.230
You're early.

41:43.305 --> 41:49.188
