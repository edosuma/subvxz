00:03.103 --> 00:04.970
Johnny: Well, what do you think
of the new wheels?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.872
- Do you want my honest
opinion?

00:06.907 --> 00:08.840
Or...

00:08.875 --> 00:10.208
- You got your wallet?

00:10.243 --> 00:11.743
- Um, I have my debit card.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.945
- And what about your license?

00:13.980 --> 00:15.313
- What about it?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.082
- Do you have it?

00:17.117 --> 00:18.517
- It's fine.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.619
- It was a yes or no question.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.621
- Okay, yes, it's fine.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.023
We're going up the street,
I don't need my license.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.992
- David, we just insured
the car,

00:27.027 --> 00:29.928
and you can't drive it unless
you have your license on you,

00:29.963 --> 00:32.064
so could you go get it, please?

00:32.099 --> 00:34.499
- (Sighs) It's expired.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.201
- When did your license expire?!

00:36.236 --> 00:38.070
- I don't know!
Like, last month.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.005
- Then you're not driving!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.207
- Well, I drove the car
yesterday!

00:42.242 --> 00:44.276
- Well, that's illegal, David!
- Argh!

00:44.311 --> 00:46.311
- You need to go renew
your license!

00:46.346 --> 00:47.746
Alexis: Are you guys done
with the car?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.014
- No, we're just leaving.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.949
- Okay, 'cause it looks like
you're getting out.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.985
- We're changing seats because
David's license is expired.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.487
- (Gasps) Oh no!

00:55.522 --> 00:57.522
And it took him like,
16 tries to get it last time.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.591
- It didn't take me 16 tries!

00:59.626 --> 01:02.027
I failed the written test twice,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.362
and then took the driving test,
and passed!

01:04.397 --> 01:06.231
- And then your learner's
permit expired,

01:06.266 --> 01:07.699
and you had to do
the written test again,

01:07.734 --> 01:09.434
which you... failed.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.169
- Oh, I remember this!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.571
You had to start from scratch,

01:12.606 --> 01:15.073
and you failed the practical
two more times.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.342
- God! Moira: Oh, the poor thing
has crippling test anxiety.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.010
We all know that.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.479
Who has the keys?
I need the car.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.014
- Well, we're using the car
right now, sweetheart.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.186
- David, would you drive your
mummy to Town Hall, please?

01:28.221 --> 01:30.722
- He can't drive,
his license is expired.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.324
- Okay, I will drive.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.925
- You got your wallet?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.327
- It's fine.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.928
(Car doors slam)

01:41.001 --> 01:45.470
♪ ♪

(Birds chirp)

01:52.746 --> 01:54.412
(Door slams)

01:54.447 --> 01:57.315
(Dog barks in the distance)

02:01.388 --> 02:03.355
- Ugh!
- Oooh!

02:03.390 --> 02:05.357
So many boxes.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.159
- And most of them are filled
with paperwork

02:07.194 --> 02:09.628
I have to go through,

02:09.663 --> 02:11.563
so I'm just hoping I contract
some deadly lung infection

02:11.598 --> 02:13.965
from the dust before I have
to open another one.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.101
- Um well, I wouldn't really
worry about it,

02:16.136 --> 02:17.536
I managed several galleries,

02:17.571 --> 02:20.338
and never once looked
at the paperwork, so.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.973
It either all comes together,
or it doesn't.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.408
Ultimately.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.310
- Did it ever come together?

02:25.345 --> 02:27.546
- Um, I think we're getting
sidetracked.

02:27.581 --> 02:32.117
The upside is that you
are your own boss now!

02:33.620 --> 02:35.287
- Or I'm the owner
of a very sad business

02:35.322 --> 02:37.422
with one underperforming
employee.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.058
- Okay, what I find helpful
when I get overwhelmed

02:40.093 --> 02:42.360
is actually taking a step away

02:42.395 --> 02:45.530
for like, 15 minutes
to an hour,

02:45.565 --> 02:48.099
to um, to maybe two hours,

02:48.134 --> 02:50.502
and ah, helping... people.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.072
- I feel like there's a request
coming on.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.807
- Mm, not so much a request,

02:55.842 --> 02:57.576
as it is an opportunity.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.111
I am looking for a very
lucky person

03:01.648 --> 03:04.883
to drive me to my driver's test.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.688
- Oh yeah, that's not
gonna happen right now.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.124
- Um, I guess you're right.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.593
I should probably be
helping you.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.528
I would love to run
some errands,

03:16.563 --> 03:18.430
or you know, maybe pick
something up,

03:18.465 --> 03:21.600
I just-I just need a valid
driver's license.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.075
The test is this afternoon.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.179
And I'm very anxious about it.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.214
And need a lift.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.450
Um... you know what?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.051
I don't think this is a good
time to ask.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.288
- Hmm, that's really perceptive.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.423
- Um, I'm gonna find someone
with a little more time...

03:45.458 --> 03:47.659
on their hands.
- Okay.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.227
- Okay...

03:49.262 --> 03:51.997
- I don't know why you didn't
ask me first, David.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.865
I have my license in seven
different countries,

03:53.900 --> 03:55.433
And I have my "F" Class.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.369
- Isn't that for
transport trucks?!

03:57.404 --> 03:59.371
- Yes, well, I had a lot
of people to move!

03:59.406 --> 04:00.872
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.440
You just get in,
you do what they tell you,

04:02.475 --> 04:03.808
and then you get out.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.377
And wear your best
hair perfume.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.412
- Okay, I don't have
hair perfume,

04:07.447 --> 04:09.681
and not all of us can
flirt our way

04:09.716 --> 04:11.483
into getting a driver's license!

04:11.518 --> 04:14.019
- Okay, you try parallel
parking in a burka, David.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.820
No amount of flirting
can get you out of that,

04:15.855 --> 04:17.489
trust me!

04:17.524 --> 04:19.291
- Okay, the big difference
is that nothing

04:19.326 --> 04:20.659
seems to give you anxiety,

04:20.694 --> 04:22.193
which is actually
sort of concerning.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.595
- Oh, that reminds me,

04:23.630 --> 04:24.896
can you hold the wheel
for a second,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.431
I need to check my phone.
- Oh my God!

04:26.466 --> 04:28.199
I'll tell you what's not
helping me right now!

04:28.234 --> 04:29.801
This!
- Hey, relax, David.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.003
I once had a 7-year-old
drive me around Mumbai,

04:32.038 --> 04:34.239
so I'm pretty sure you're cool
to steer for a sec.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.674
- Ugh!
- Okay.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.410
Okay!

04:38.445 --> 04:39.844
- (Sighs nervously)

04:41.314 --> 04:43.214
- Breaths!
- (Exhales)

04:43.249 --> 04:45.183
- Breaths!
- (Exhales)

04:45.218 --> 04:46.685
(Exhales)

04:48.154 --> 04:49.521
(Traffic rumbles, birds chirp)

04:52.158 --> 04:53.658
(Door opens)

04:54.994 --> 04:56.528
- Oh Stevie, I don't mean
to bother you,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.530
but um, there's a leaky faucet

04:58.565 --> 05:01.399
in David and Alexis' bathroom.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.235
- And this is a pressing
issue for you?

05:04.270 --> 05:06.638
- Well, it's just that when
you're in our bathroom,

05:06.673 --> 05:08.506
you can hear it clear as day,

05:08.541 --> 05:10.075
I mean, it's almost like
it's happening...

05:10.110 --> 05:12.077
in our bathroom.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.478
- But it's not.

05:13.513 --> 05:16.748
So I'm just gonna finish
this first.

05:16.783 --> 05:17.949
- Hi.
- And--

05:17.984 --> 05:20.719
- Stevie, I'll need your
telephone, please.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.688
- Sure.
- Along with the number for a plumber.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.624
The faucet is dripping
in David and Alexis' room.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.293
It's exasperating,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.595
the incessant tap, tap, tap...

05:30.630 --> 05:32.330
- Oh, it's so irritating,
Stevie, it...

05:32.365 --> 05:33.698
- (Stevie sobs)

05:33.733 --> 05:36.167
- But maybe this is uh...

05:36.202 --> 05:37.936
not a good time.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.804
- (Sobs loudly)

05:39.839 --> 05:42.240
- Oh, boy troubles, no doubt.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.608
We don't want to intrude, dear,

05:43.643 --> 05:45.677
just when you can,
plumber, please.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.712
- Or get someone else
to do it, Stevie,

05:47.747 --> 05:50.148
because you are the owner now.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.217
- Yeah!

05:52.252 --> 05:54.419
And I don't know what I'm doing!

05:54.454 --> 05:56.588
- Oh! None of us do, dear!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.723
We're all just muddling
through, aren't we?

05:58.758 --> 06:00.458
I mean, look at John.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.793
- Why look at me?!

06:01.828 --> 06:04.095
- I'm saying, even someone
with a history

06:04.130 --> 06:07.365
of wild success can experience
a downtick now and then.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.401
- Well, I didn't realize
I had a downtick, Moira.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.902
- Just, I don't know what to do,

06:10.937 --> 06:12.704
do I sell the motel?

06:12.739 --> 06:14.439
- Sell the motel? No, no!

06:14.474 --> 06:17.609
No, no, that's not something
you should be thinking about.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.611
- Mmm!
- I mean, I can't keep it!

06:19.646 --> 06:22.580
- Okay, Stevie, allow me
to get you a pill.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.916
It's going to make you
forget every last one

06:24.951 --> 06:27.852
of those irrational thoughts
for at least two days!

06:27.887 --> 06:30.555
- Yes, and Stevie,
if you need any help at all,

06:30.590 --> 06:32.490
please, feel free
to come by our room.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.325
- Well, I'll be at work.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.660
But John will be there,

06:35.695 --> 06:37.395
implementing and strategizing.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.697
- And honestly, the drip
is just uh, you know,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.867
a wish list project,
lowest of priorities.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.437
- I'm-I just need a minute,
and I'll do it.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.238
- Sure, yes, of course.
- Oh, Stevie.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.773
(French accent) Courage!

06:48.808 --> 06:50.475
- (Sobs)

06:50.510 --> 06:51.943
(Door slams)

06:53.913 --> 06:55.180
(Groans)

06:57.617 --> 06:59.884
- Whoa! - John, you don't really
think she'd sell the place, do you?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.921
- It would not bode well
for us if she did.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.393
(Door slams)

07:08.428 --> 07:09.828
(Car rumbles)

07:16.836 --> 07:18.269
- Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

07:18.304 --> 07:20.505
for 20 minutes, so that I can
do my transcendental meditation

07:20.540 --> 07:22.240
before I fail this test.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.276
- Okay, you are acting
all sorts of crazy right now.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.911
This honestly does not matter.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.313
Nobody cares.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.215
- Uh, people care.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.218
I care, the driving examiner
person cares.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.020
- No, he doesn't.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.156
Trust me, people aren't
thinking about you

07:38.191 --> 07:40.425
the way that you're thinking
about you.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.926
- What does that mean?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.661
- You always over think
everything,

07:43.696 --> 07:45.330
and that's why you fail
all the time.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.631
- Thank you, Alexis.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.666
- Well, it's true!

07:48.701 --> 07:51.169
- Okay, just because everything
falls in your lap,

07:51.204 --> 07:54.305
doesn't mean it falls
in everyone else's.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.840
- What does?!

07:55.875 --> 07:58.576
- What?
- What falls in my lap?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.412
- Stuff! Things.
Opportunities.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.281
- Things don't fall in my lap!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.649
- Okay, I'm just saying,

08:04.684 --> 08:06.784
that you've always just
gotten stuff,

08:06.819 --> 08:09.654
without realizing that other
people don't skate through life

08:09.689 --> 08:11.389
the same way you do.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.324
- I don't skate through
Life, David,

08:13.359 --> 08:14.692
I walk through life.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.261
In really nice shoes.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.563
And I'm sorry if that rubs you
the wrong way,

08:18.598 --> 08:20.498
but maybe if you could
just relax for a second,

08:20.533 --> 08:21.900
and stop worrying
about everything,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.835
everything would be
easier for you!

08:23.870 --> 08:25.770
- And what I'm saying
is that things haven't

08:25.805 --> 08:28.406
been as easy for me
as they've been for you!

08:28.441 --> 08:30.341
- Um, yes, they have!

08:30.376 --> 08:32.477
- No, they haven't!

08:32.512 --> 08:33.945
And now I'm even more
stressed out

08:33.980 --> 08:36.014
than when I got
in the stupid car!

08:37.350 --> 08:39.417
Thank you very much
for your help, Alexis.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.952
- Hey!

08:40.987 --> 08:43.555
I'm the one that's supposed
to be getting out

08:43.590 --> 08:45.523
of the stupid car, David!

08:45.558 --> 08:47.392
The driving man's coming!

08:47.427 --> 08:48.893
- Oh my God!

08:57.870 --> 08:59.170
- David?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.705
Nobody cares.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.340
- I got it!
- Okay!

09:04.310 --> 09:05.777
- (Sighs)

09:07.146 --> 09:11.616
♪ ♪

09:11.651 --> 09:13.685
(Birds chirp)

09:16.756 --> 09:18.957
Johnny: Hey, Stevie.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.358
Good news,

09:20.393 --> 09:23.261
I fixed the drip in David
and Alexis' bathroom,

09:23.296 --> 09:25.630
so you can check that
off your list.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.999
- Thank you.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.935
- You know, to be honest
it's more a temporary fix,

09:30.970 --> 09:33.371
I put a sandwich bag
over the faucet,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.506
and secured it with...

09:35.541 --> 09:37.342
an elastic.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.612
- Oh okay, won't the drips...

09:40.647 --> 09:43.281
fill up the sandwich bag?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.917
- Well, like I said,
it's temporary,

09:45.952 --> 09:48.553
uh, but it might buy you
a little time.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.755
- A little.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.992
- Ooh! A ledger?

09:57.063 --> 09:58.896
I haven't seen one of these
in a while.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.966
Aha, well, at first glance,

10:03.403 --> 10:04.869
what you think of say,

10:04.904 --> 10:07.872
charging for late check outs?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.774
- Yeah, again, that would assume

10:09.809 --> 10:12.410
that we had guests
to check out.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.812
- Well, there's a solution
to everything, Stevie,

10:14.847 --> 10:16.547
and when that idea comes,

10:16.582 --> 10:18.049
it's going to appear...

10:18.084 --> 10:19.350
so obvious.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.586
- Well, I mean, I did think
that I could start

10:21.621 --> 10:25.189
charging full price
to the long term guests here.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.893
- And sometimes it's the second
or third idea

10:28.928 --> 10:31.195
that's really the keeper.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.165
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.433
(Door slams)

10:39.505 --> 10:41.673
- Oh, Moira's in early.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.841
- Oh, just catching up
on my reading.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.576
- Well, we'll leave you to it.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.615
- Oh dear, that's a shame.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.150
(Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk)

10:55.354 --> 10:57.121
That's a real shame!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.257
The old pulp mill in Elmdale,
torn down.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.528
- That reminds me, I gotta
check out the new pulp mill.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.996
I hear it's breathtaking.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.998
- But surely the old pulp mill
had its charm,

11:07.033 --> 11:09.000
and it was an historic landmark.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.868
- Where'd you find
that article?!

11:10.903 --> 11:13.738
The old pulp mill closed down
what, two years ago?

11:13.773 --> 11:16.040
- Well, it just makes
one think,

11:16.075 --> 11:18.743
might there be a building
struggling in our town

11:18.778 --> 11:21.612
that could, with the aid
of municipal funds,

11:21.647 --> 11:23.881
avoid befalling a similar fate?

11:23.916 --> 11:26.184
- Like the library.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.186
Gwen does all her internet
stuff there,

11:28.221 --> 11:31.522
you know, she worries about
people tracing her IP address.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.692
- I was thinking
of another worthy landmark,

11:34.727 --> 11:36.260
the motel.

11:36.295 --> 11:39.997
- Oh, that sounds like more
of a personal issue.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.633
- Oh, it's very personal,
for Stevie.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.235
The poor thing is a wreck.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.038
Inheriting the motel,
feeling lost and alone.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.907
She even threatened
to sell the place!

11:49.942 --> 11:52.243
A pitiable creature,
that's what she is.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.712
John and I, we both threw
our arms around her,

11:54.747 --> 11:56.147
figuratively speaking,

11:56.182 --> 11:58.015
and we said, the people
of this town,

11:58.050 --> 12:00.518
and Council in particular,

12:00.553 --> 12:03.621
will not let this business
go under, Stevie.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.857
For your sake, Stevie!

12:05.892 --> 12:08.693
- I thought you were against
giving town funds

12:08.728 --> 12:10.695
to heritage projects.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.164
- Yeah, when we wanted
to restore the war memorial,

12:13.199 --> 12:16.801
you said we should avoid
taking sides.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.036
- But this cause
affects everyone.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.939
We all know, or are,

12:21.974 --> 12:24.041
people who live in the motel.

12:25.845 --> 12:29.046
In closing, I move that we free
up heritage funds

12:29.081 --> 12:30.915
for the motel,
effective immediately,

12:30.950 --> 12:32.950
all in favor, say Aye.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.255
Ronnie, you're with me?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.990
I see that you're scratching.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.925
Bob! You're making a note!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.661
- Oh, just writing uh,
"visit new pulp mill."

12:43.696 --> 12:45.096
Yeah, Roland got me thinking.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.764
- I hear the floors
are so clean,

12:46.799 --> 12:48.032
you can eat your lunch
off them.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.700
- I laid those floors.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.005
(Car rumbles)

12:57.677 --> 12:59.343
(Phone buttons click)

13:01.781 --> 13:03.815
- Okay, Derek.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.983
You are gonna make a turn
up ahead.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.518
- Uh, it's David.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.988
- Oh yep, sorry about that.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.723
- Um, I just didn't want you
thinking

13:12.758 --> 13:14.625
you had gotten
in the wrong car.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.761
- Rose, David?
- Yes.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.263
- Sorry, it's been a long day.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.233
- Um, so a left or a right?

13:24.170 --> 13:25.403
- What?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.904
- You said there's a turn
coming up,

13:26.939 --> 13:29.307
do you want a left turn,
or a right turn?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.809
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's a left.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.078
- Okay.
- But when I tell you to make a left.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.581
- Okay. Um, can I ask you
a question?

13:38.117 --> 13:40.952
- Uh yep, failure to signal
will be counted.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.787
- Um, how old are you?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.991
- Twenty-eight.
- Mhmm, and is this like,

13:47.026 --> 13:49.126
what you would like to do
for a career?

13:49.161 --> 13:52.430
- Well, I uh,
I DJ on the weekends.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.398
- Ah.
- Why?

13:55.902 --> 13:58.002
- So you don't really care
about this.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.437
Like, about me, in the car.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.038
I mean, you care in the sense
that it's your job,

14:01.073 --> 14:04.842
but you don't-you don't care
about this, do you?

14:04.877 --> 14:07.411
- I've done like,
eight of these today.

14:07.446 --> 14:08.880
Is that a problem?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.348
- No.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.119
(Birds chirp)

14:17.189 --> 14:18.956
(Key rattles in lock)

14:18.991 --> 14:20.725
(Adding machine whirs)

14:23.029 --> 14:25.196
- Oh, there she is,
back from council.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.998
Any chance of a bailout?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.133
- I was very persuasive.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.068
And there were lots
of questions,

14:31.103 --> 14:32.904
that shows engagement.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.439
- Good, 'cause even with
just a little cash flow,

14:35.474 --> 14:38.009
I think Stevie can get
this motel back on its feet.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.011
- Excellent.
- Yes.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.079
- And if she can get let's say,

14:42.114 --> 14:44.015
a volume discount
on paper products,

14:44.050 --> 14:46.317
or offer deals on last minute
bookings, then--

14:46.352 --> 14:48.819
- Well, it sounds to me
like we may not even need

14:48.854 --> 14:50.888
those funds from Council.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.890
- Oh, no, no,
we need the funds,

14:52.925 --> 14:54.292
that's for sure,
but I'm just saying,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.227
if she took some
of my suggestions--

14:56.262 --> 14:57.995
- Stop!

14:58.030 --> 14:59.997
I want to remember this moment.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.400
- What moment?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.135
- I haven't seen you this
excited in a very long time.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.870
- No, I'm just thinking
of Stevie,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.338
and listen,

15:07.373 --> 15:09.407
how much money do you think
we can get from council?

15:09.442 --> 15:12.076
- Well, now I'm wondering
if that money

15:12.111 --> 15:14.278
might not just
complicate things.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.014
Look how much you've achieved
with your back to the wall.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.317
Necessity drives invention,

15:19.352 --> 15:22.453
and far be it from me
to rob you of your necessity!

15:22.488 --> 15:25.256
- Well, I'm not thinking of
getting that involved, Moira,

15:25.291 --> 15:27.692
I'm just offering a bit
of advice.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.427
- You've been looking
for a project, John.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.129
- Well, not running a motel,
Moira, that's a commitment

15:32.164 --> 15:34.031
- Or not! Go!

15:34.066 --> 15:35.866
Go tell Stevie
of your decision.

15:35.901 --> 15:39.070
- What decision? - And I'll instruct
Council to save their largesse

15:39.105 --> 15:41.138
for a more worthy charity.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.874
- You didn't get the money,
did you?

15:43.909 --> 15:45.343
- Go, John!

15:45.378 --> 15:48.179
Before the passion dies again!

15:50.082 --> 15:51.515
(Door slams)

15:54.487 --> 15:55.720
(Car rumbles)

15:58.157 --> 15:59.490
- So I assume you got
your license,

15:59.525 --> 16:01.258
and you're not just driving
us home illegally.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.626
- I did.
- Good.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.663
- I know.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.099
- How was your tester guy,
was he a monster?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.234
- He was fine.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.005
Slightly distracted.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.173
Transitioning to a career
as a DJ,

16:16.208 --> 16:18.376
but apparently none
of the venues around here

16:18.411 --> 16:21.112
could handle his sound...

16:21.147 --> 16:23.414
- See? I told you.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.149
He didn't care.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.951
You never trust me!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.886
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

16:28.921 --> 16:30.321
- Yes, I do.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.156
- No, and you never take
my advice.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.392
And I'm always the last
person you turn to.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.060
- What do you want me to say?

16:36.095 --> 16:39.030
- Well like, what makes me
different than Stevie or Mom?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.865
You trust them with stuff.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.300
- Okay, you wanna talk trust?!

16:43.335 --> 16:45.903
Stevie and Mom weren't running
around the world

16:45.938 --> 16:47.838
for a decade and a half
with random men,

16:47.873 --> 16:50.441
leaving me at home to wonder
whether they were okay!

16:50.476 --> 16:53.244
- Well, I'm sorry for
having fun, David.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.113
With a selection of very
confident international men.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.249
But I was always okay.
- Were you?!

16:58.284 --> 17:00.251
Because I was the one
at the consulate

17:00.286 --> 17:01.886
sending you temporary passports,

17:01.921 --> 17:04.922
and colored contacts lenses
whenever you needed them.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.824
I was the one at home,

17:06.859 --> 17:09.160
not having fun because I was...

17:09.195 --> 17:11.796
constantly worried
which East Asian palace

17:13.332 --> 17:15.533
Alexis was being held
hostage in this week.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.769
Not Mom and Dad.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.938
Me!

17:20.973 --> 17:22.907
- Well, you didn't have
to worry about me.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.875
- Well, I did.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.817
(Birds chirp)

17:37.590 --> 17:39.090
Ray: ...As your realtor
I would take pictures,

17:39.125 --> 17:40.825
Arrange viewings,

17:40.860 --> 17:43.194
dress each room with
complimentary baskets

17:43.229 --> 17:45.162
of plastic foods.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.530
- Okay, and if we're going
to do this,

17:46.565 --> 17:48.466
what would the timeline be like?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.301
- The sooner the better,
I have my camera in the car.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.470
- What's going on?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.638
- Ray and I are just
discussing--

17:54.673 --> 17:55.873
- Selling the motel.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.310
- I have to weigh all
the options, Mr. Rose.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.545
- Yeah, I thought we talked
about this?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.314
- Ray came to me.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.850
- There's never been a better
time to sell a motel.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.953
- It's a terrible time
to sell this motel.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.522
- Either way, in reality,

18:11.557 --> 18:13.290
it's always best to tell the
client what they want to hear.

18:13.325 --> 18:16.327
- Yeah, but I think selling
is not necessarily

18:16.362 --> 18:18.596
the best way to solve a problem.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.799
- Maybe we should discuss
this at a later date,

18:21.834 --> 18:24.335
or um, when Mr. Rose
has left the room.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.170
- Well, I'm not leaving,

18:26.205 --> 18:28.105
and Stevie's not selling.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.007
- I might be selling.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.109
I-I can't do this
on my own, so.

18:32.144 --> 18:35.412
- Well, maybe not on your own,
but um...

18:37.283 --> 18:39.283
what if you had a partner?

18:39.318 --> 18:41.452
- Stevie, as your agent,

18:41.487 --> 18:43.687
I would advise against
partnering with somebody

18:43.722 --> 18:45.489
who has no capital,

18:45.524 --> 18:48.659
no contacts,
no industry experience.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.594
- Well, thank you, Ray, but I
did run a big corporation,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.397
and I'm perfectly capable
of handling this.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.766
And I think it's...

18:55.801 --> 18:58.102
something I wanna do.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.105
- Oh well, this is all
very exciting.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.141
However, if any of this falls
through for any reason,

19:04.176 --> 19:05.409
perhaps one of the ones
I mentioned,

19:05.444 --> 19:07.378
then do give me a call.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.214
- Well, Stevie's not selling.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.183
- Here's my card.
- Yeah. Okay.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.251
(Stevie sighs)

19:14.286 --> 19:16.053
(Door creaks shut)

19:16.088 --> 19:17.421
You don't have to do this,
Mr. Rose.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.957
- Well, it's not charity,
Stevie.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.392
I mean...

19:21.427 --> 19:23.093
I'll take a percentage
of the profits,

19:23.128 --> 19:25.296
if and when this place
ever sees any.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.531
- You're actually serious?

19:27.566 --> 19:30.367
- I'm getting more serious
by the second.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.038
Any help you need, accounting,
sales, marketing...

19:34.073 --> 19:35.973
- Plumbing?

19:36.008 --> 19:39.143
- Plumbing, yes, it might keep
me away from the books, but--

19:39.178 --> 19:41.045
- Oh, thank you so much!

19:42.648 --> 19:44.181
Oh! I'm sorry.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.183
Oh my gosh.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.685
(Stevie laughs)

19:52.224 --> 19:54.425
- Yeah, I just feel like
the whole session was rushed,

19:54.460 --> 19:55.893
Like, there was no
back lighting,

19:55.928 --> 19:57.127
or emotional direction.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.263
- Nobody likes their driver's
license photo, David.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.332
- Okay yeah, I was just hoping
I would get some options.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.067
- Well...
- Ohhh!

20:03.102 --> 20:04.468
- It's done.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.170
- Have you been in there
the whole time?!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.771
- The sink doesn't fix itself.

20:07.806 --> 20:09.673
Moira? Kids?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.408
Check it out.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.013
- Ugh.
- (David scoffs)

20:21.587 --> 20:24.421
- Okay kids, give it a spin.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.425
- (Sighs)

20:28.460 --> 20:30.094
(Water splashes)

20:33.732 --> 20:35.165
You changed it so that
the hot water

20:35.200 --> 20:36.834
comes out of the cold water tap?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.535
- No, I fixed the drip.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.338
- Now, turn it off.
- What are we all looking at?

20:41.373 --> 20:43.374
- Um, Dad messed up our tap.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.409
- No, I fixed the drip.
Turn it off, honey.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.878
- It's getting hotter.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.580
- Okay well, turn it the other way, then.
- Turn it off!

20:49.615 --> 20:51.815
- Ow! Ow!
It's burning my hand now!

20:51.850 --> 20:53.083
- I see steam, John.
- Okay well, how do you turn it off?

20:53.118 --> 20:55.352
- It's a tap, just turn it off!
- I turned it off!

20:55.387 --> 20:57.454
- Good! Good!

20:57.489 --> 20:59.657
See? No drip.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.765
- I'm gonna go.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.166
- Ow!

21:12.871 --> 21:14.138
(Thumps)
