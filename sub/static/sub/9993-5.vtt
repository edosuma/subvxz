WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:06.955
Okay... so who wants to be the medium?

00:08.280 --> 00:11.600
Oh, come on, guys, someone has to call the dead out to play.

00:13.149 --> 00:14.058
Suzannah?

00:15.273 --> 00:16.666
Knew it, chicken.

00:18.507 --> 00:19.312
Katie?

00:20.394 --> 00:21.632
I don't know.

00:21.797 --> 00:23.165
I mean, it's your house.

00:23.216 --> 00:25.074
It's your idea.
It's your everything.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.843
Hey, I'm trying to be polite.

00:27.274 --> 00:28.140
Allison?

00:30.052 --> 00:33.671
Hey, I thought we were goingto go to the Safari Hotel, crash the pool.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.094
No, uh-uh, not tonight.

00:35.733 --> 00:40.129
I made an important decision. I need
the dead to tell me if I'm doing the right thing.

00:40.176 --> 00:42.165
Fingertips on, everybody.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:55.413 --> 00:57.825
Spirits from beyond, we welcome you.

01:03.751 --> 01:04.768
They're here.

01:04.882 --> 01:05.757
You're moving it.

01:05.808 --> 01:06.691
Bite me.

01:08.745 --> 01:10.669
Tell me, kind spirits,

01:11.104 --> 01:16.080
is tomorrow the perfect day for me to pack up my car and head for California?

01:16.332 --> 01:17.595
- California?
- Are you insane?

01:17.656 --> 01:19.113
- You can't do that.
- What about your mom?

01:19.164 --> 01:22.568
You're not really going to leave in the middle of senior year.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.423
I got this two days ago.

01:27.612 --> 01:28.454
Playboy?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.962
What? I'm 18.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.952
Back at Easter, I borrowed Danny Brown's Polaroid,

01:33.003 --> 01:37.196
and I stood in front of the mirror, and I took naked pictures of myself,

01:37.247 --> 01:38.474
and I sent them in.

01:38.525 --> 01:39.292
Lyla!

01:39.343 --> 01:40.843
And they want to meet me.

01:40.953 --> 01:43.403
"While it is difficult to tell from these pictures

01:43.454 --> 01:45.838
"whether you are actually Playboy material...

01:46.679 --> 01:47.675
"if you are ever

01:47.726 --> 01:49.843
"in Southern California, please feel free to..."

01:49.894 --> 01:51.084
That's three things.

01:51.399 --> 01:53.322
It's the ad I answered from the modeling agency

01:53.373 --> 01:55.800
about the car shows and conventions, this letter,

01:55.851 --> 01:58.328
and there's that guy that I met from L.A. at Pilgrim's

01:58.379 --> 02:01.048
who said they're always looking for game show contestants.

02:01.099 --> 02:02.708
I just...
I think it's a sign.

02:02.759 --> 02:04.703
I think it's where I have to go.

02:05.968 --> 02:07.123
Don't do this.

02:07.368 --> 02:09.009
Well, what else am I going to do?

02:09.061 --> 02:10.187
I hate this place.

02:10.239 --> 02:11.780
I'm not college material.

02:12.045 --> 02:14.507
And besides, my mom's got this new boyfriend,

02:14.558 --> 02:17.190
And it's getting weird.
He keeps looking at me funny.

02:17.241 --> 02:19.455
I wish you'd at least wait till graduation.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.857
Why? What do I need a diploma for?

02:21.967 --> 02:25.211
I just... I want my life to start.
I don't want to wait.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.816
Why does everybody look so sad?

02:29.988 --> 02:32.011
I'm excited.
I want to celebrate.

02:32.505 --> 02:34.351
Fine. I'm excited.

02:34.899 --> 02:36.635
Anything to get out of here.

02:36.764 --> 02:38.093
Hey, you have your fake I.D.?

02:38.144 --> 02:39.242
We could go to Pilgrim's.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.179
Yeah, my purse is in the kitchen.

02:51.929 --> 02:54.641
They mock the dead with that game, you know.

02:56.956 --> 02:58.484
Ally, let's go!

02:59.544 --> 03:00.973
I know the answer...

03:01.699 --> 03:05.413
the answer to her question, and it's not pretty.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.034
Do you want to know the answer?

03:12.010 --> 03:14.429
I want you to go away.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.661
I want you to leave me alone.

03:28.613 --> 03:30.533
Something coming in off the desert.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.456
Did I wake you?

03:34.713 --> 03:36.370
No, I'm fine.
I'm just...

03:37.030 --> 03:37.878
Just a dream.

03:40.079 --> 03:41.193
Was it a bad one?

03:42.096 --> 03:42.954
No.

03:43.713 --> 03:46.189
Not really a dream.
It was...

03:48.356 --> 03:51.030
Well, I dreamt it, but it was more of a memory,

03:51.508 --> 03:53.903
something that happened a long time ago.

03:55.704 --> 03:56.907
Nothing important.

03:57.459 --> 03:58.701
Just a memory.

03:59.036 --> 04:01.639
A rerun. What a rook.

04:59.288 --> 05:00.586
Something I said?

05:01.379 --> 05:02.401
What time is it?

05:02.804 --> 05:03.889
5:47.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.026
A.M.

05:08.595 --> 05:12.025
You probably haven't noticed, but everyone else in the house...

05:13.139 --> 05:14.940
in the world, is sleeping.

05:15.665 --> 05:20.075
And, I mean, speaking only for myself, I think they're on to something.

05:20.916 --> 05:25.804
I'm sorry, I suddenly realized that this has been on my to-do list for the last 18 years.

05:26.337 --> 05:28.969
And it can't wait for another hour and a half?

05:36.914 --> 05:40.110
We drove backwards down the Arizona Pike one night.

05:40.807 --> 05:41.779
Well, she drove.

05:41.897 --> 05:44.704
I  just sat in the front seat and screamed.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.383
That is crazy.

05:48.310 --> 05:52.570
We ran naked through the middle of the Boy Scout Jamboree in Prescott at Easter.

05:53.794 --> 05:55.608
I always wanted to be a scout.

05:56.349 --> 05:59.459
We did a lot of other things I'm not telling you about.

05:59.864 --> 06:00.487
Huh.

06:02.105 --> 06:03.857
Yeah, she was pretty out there.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.370
So, wait a sec.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.772
What happened to her?
Where is she now?

06:11.206 --> 06:12.226
I don't know.

06:13.425 --> 06:16.450
She just up and drove to California one day.

06:16.806 --> 06:19.044
I tried to write her a couple of times.

06:21.128 --> 06:23.411
But to be fair, my address changed.

06:23.462 --> 06:25.926
I had a lot going on in my life then, too.

06:27.419 --> 06:28.596
College...

06:32.952 --> 06:34.286
...and then you.

06:34.814 --> 06:35.560
Me?

06:36.080 --> 06:39.338
My very own Boy Scout Jamboree.

06:56.022 --> 06:59.192
Allison, I'd like you to meet Councilman Stuart McCallister.

07:05.455 --> 07:07.661
The Councilman has come to me with a personal problem,

07:07.712 --> 07:11.066
and Detective Scanlon and I thought you might be able to help.

07:11.496 --> 07:13.604
I'm, uh, trying to locate someone,

07:14.225 --> 07:18.032
and I'm told that you're, uh, pretty good at that.

07:18.801 --> 07:20.225
Well, I have my days.

07:20.765 --> 07:22.391
So, who are you looking for?

07:22.870 --> 07:23.653
My daughter.

07:24.222 --> 07:25.837
He hasn't seen her for a week.

07:25.888 --> 07:28.465
She said she was going to a movie and never came home.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.521
I'm so sorry.

07:30.255 --> 07:31.713
It's not the first time.

07:32.566 --> 07:34.222
She's 19, and the truth is,

07:34.273 --> 07:37.839
according to the law, she's free to do what she wants.

07:38.193 --> 07:39.589
Um,  it's just that...

07:40.481 --> 07:44.045
well, let's just say she takes some pleasure in associating with...

07:45.197 --> 07:47.519
I-I think they're rather unsavory people.

07:48.531 --> 07:52.200
And she's been known to indulge in some fairly risky behavior.

07:52.251 --> 07:53.315
And if she can...

07:53.572 --> 07:56.742
embarrass her father, the public servant,
at the same time,

07:56.938 --> 07:57.843
well, all the more fun.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.494
Right.

07:58.406 --> 08:00.073
I explained to the councilman that since,

08:00.124 --> 08:02.599
as far as we know,
she's not breaking the law,

08:02.650 --> 08:05.494
the best we can do is find her and give her a nudge towards home.

08:05.545 --> 08:07.098
And that's all I'm looking for.

08:07.149 --> 08:09.372
Now, I've given the detective, uh, a list of her friends--

08:09.423 --> 08:11.108
at least the ones I'm aware of--

08:11.159 --> 08:13.005
places I believe she frequents.

08:13.792 --> 08:18.311
Obviously, uh, everyone's discretion would be appreciated.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.534
We didn't tell him anything about you.

08:20.585 --> 08:22.533
Just, uh, that you're handy at these sorts of things.

08:22.584 --> 08:24.268
I'm happy to do what I can.

08:24.483 --> 08:26.637
Did you get any kind of vibe off him?

08:27.387 --> 08:29.078
He likes his movies dirty.

08:29.489 --> 08:30.185
He's a politician.

08:30.236 --> 08:32.888
Doesn't that come with a hidden agenda and a skeleton in the closet?

08:32.932 --> 08:34.461
I don't know, I felt sorry for him.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.134
The whole thing sounded sad.

08:37.143 --> 08:39.259
people ask me why I don't have kids.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.076
Come on, you were a kid once.

08:41.126 --> 08:41.952
Not me.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.746
Came out just like this.

08:43.816 --> 08:47.131
A few less clothes, maybe, but basically just like this.

08:48.648 --> 08:50.134
I'll get to work on this list of friends.

08:50.185 --> 08:53.361
If I find anyone or anything interesting, I'll give you a call.

08:53.412 --> 08:54.082
Who knows?

08:55.744 --> 08:57.937
Maybe she'll just come home all by herself.

08:57.988 --> 08:58.918
Oh, wait, wait!

09:00.054 --> 09:02.022
Actually, I need a favor.

09:03.128 --> 09:05.956
I need you to find someone for me.

09:06.637 --> 09:08.237
She's an old friend of mine from high school.

09:08.288 --> 09:11.280
I haven't seen her in ages, but she's been on my mind lately.

09:11.331 --> 09:12.528
I'm guessing she might be married,

09:12.579 --> 09:15.274
so she might have a different last name, but that's the year she was born--

09:15.325 --> 09:17.465
the same as me-- and that's the year she graduated.

09:17.516 --> 09:21.012
We went to the same high school, but really, that's all I have.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.343
I'm sorry, the number you have...

09:25.394 --> 09:27.580
I'm sorry, the number you have dialed has been...

09:27.631 --> 09:31.355
...have dialed has been disconnected, and there is no forwarding number.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.722
Uh, try Camelot Lane.

09:39.352 --> 09:41.112
You don't have a Camelot Lane?

09:41.290 --> 09:42.325
Oh, that's right.

09:42.376 --> 09:44.086
There is no more Camelot Lane.

09:44.461 --> 09:46.744
Hi, um, my name's Allison Dubois,

09:46.795 --> 09:49.587
but back in high school, my name was Allison Rolen.

09:50.206 --> 09:54.405
I know it's been a long time, but I just thought I'd call and say hi, um,

09:54.456 --> 09:57.969
and maybe see if you kept in touch with Lyla Gallagher.

09:59.135 --> 10:02.737
Anyway, I'd love to hear back from you, catch up and all that.

10:03.101 --> 10:07.259
My number's, uh, 602-555-0119.

10:10.393 --> 10:12.676
Everyone unconscious and accounted for.

10:13.838 --> 10:15.330
- No luck at all?
- Nope.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.899
Pretty pathetic, huh?

10:19.418 --> 10:21.874
A psychic who can't find no one or nothing.

10:23.536 --> 10:25.380
Can I help you find the bedroom?

10:39.456 --> 10:41.856
Al, hey, you okay?

10:42.029 --> 10:42.925
I don't know.

10:44.668 --> 10:46.816
Do we have earthquakes in Phoenix?

10:52.063 --> 10:52.816
Hey.

10:52.977 --> 10:53.577
Hey.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.393
I think I found a Lyla in Oregon that fits our profile.

10:56.444 --> 10:58.464
I wanted to talk to you about that.

11:01.542 --> 11:02.542
I found her.

11:02.673 --> 11:03.727
Oh, my God!

11:04.544 --> 11:05.453
I don't have all the details.

11:05.504 --> 11:09.638
It's probably gonna be another day or two before I have the specifics, but...

11:10.199 --> 11:14.217
apparently, your friend drowned, back in '89, somewhere in Northern California.

11:19.901 --> 11:20.932
You okay?

11:22.248 --> 11:24.050
How could I have been so wrong?

11:25.669 --> 11:28.209
In  my head, she's been alive this whole time.

11:32.111 --> 11:33.079
I'm sorry.

11:35.585 --> 11:36.473
You know what?

11:37.165 --> 11:38.979
I haven't seen her since 1987.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.206
I'm not sure that I'm entitled to be all that upset.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.258
Does that mean I'm allowed to bring up work?

11:46.713 --> 11:48.008
Oh, yeah, definitely.

11:54.136 --> 11:56.962
Well... there's still no word on Cynthia McCallister.

11:57.210 --> 12:00.203
No  activity on her credit cards, nothing on her ATM card.

12:00.254 --> 12:01.799
Nobody's spotted her car.

12:01.953 --> 12:04.480
Her friends say they have absolutely no idea where she might have gone

12:04.531 --> 12:06.080
or who she might have gone with.

12:06.131 --> 12:07.101
I called the Councilman

12:07.152 --> 12:08.683
and asked him if it might be possible to come over to the house,

12:08.734 --> 12:10.620
see her room, take a look around.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.054
I'm on my way over now.

12:13.105 --> 12:14.974
I was wondering if you want to come with.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.747
"No" is a perfectly acceptable answer, by the way.

12:21.786 --> 12:23.292
Actually, I'd like that.

12:26.350 --> 12:28.496
Cynthia's room is right down this way.

12:36.681 --> 12:39.307
Guess you'd know best if any of her stuff was missing.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.800
Everything is still there.

12:40.870 --> 12:43.872
And her suitcases are right where she always keeps them.

12:44.402 --> 12:46.498
This room been cleaned since she left?

12:48.564 --> 12:51.132
Carpets vacuumed, sheets washed?

12:53.178 --> 12:54.284
I didn't know.

12:55.826 --> 12:56.600
Okay.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.818
We'll let you know if we need anything else.

13:04.376 --> 13:06.346
Can't blame her for being thorough.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.370
I wish my house was this clean.

13:09.410 --> 13:11.759
Detective Scanlon, Mrs. Dubois.

13:19.921 --> 13:21.797
When Mrs. McCallister died 11 years ago,

13:21.848 --> 13:24.128
I promised her I'd take care of Cynthia.

13:26.609 --> 13:28.847
Clearly, I've not done a very good job.

14:23.659 --> 14:24.799
Would either of you like some coffee?

14:24.850 --> 14:26.954
I can have my staff bring you coffee.

14:27.036 --> 14:28.910
I think I know what's going on here.

14:28.961 --> 14:30.146
What are you talking about?

14:30.197 --> 14:32.220
I think she's involved in pornography--

14:32.271 --> 14:33.890
acting, performing.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.657
I think he knows about it.
It's tearing him up.

14:36.744 --> 14:39.227
That's why we're here.
That's why he came to us.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.264
I don't get it.
Why not tell us?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.290
How am I supposed to bring this girl home
when he's not even telling me where to look?

14:44.351 --> 14:47.007
He's trying to protect her.
She's his daughter.

14:47.138 --> 14:48.361
Think about his side.

14:48.412 --> 14:51.438
Would you want to tell a police detective something like that?

14:51.489 --> 14:53.219
Dirty Little Darlings IV?

14:53.575 --> 14:54.331
Pardon?

14:54.590 --> 14:56.280
It's the title of the movie that she's in.

14:56.331 --> 14:57.831
He was trying to find it.

14:58.093 --> 15:01.245
The other day when I saw into his head, I misunderstood.

15:02.631 --> 15:04.953
I think he was trying to find this movie.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.938
I think he's having trouble believing it.

15:10.547 --> 15:11.695
How you holding up?

15:12.546 --> 15:14.784
You know what?
I'll take it from here.

15:15.074 --> 15:16.451
What are you talking about?

15:16.502 --> 15:18.350
I'm going to drop you off at your house.

15:18.401 --> 15:22.065
You need to be by yourself, get upset, say good bye to your friend.

15:22.336 --> 15:23.786
You are entitled to that.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.244
I can't believe she's doing this.

15:31.295 --> 15:33.722
This? How about going to California?

15:34.387 --> 15:35.793
Should we tell somebody?

15:36.355 --> 15:38.155
Who are we going to tell?
Her mother?

15:38.206 --> 15:39.644
Her mother's not going to care.

15:39.695 --> 15:40.985
We  can't let her go.

15:44.391 --> 15:45.339
Thank you.

15:52.195 --> 15:54.578
Okay, so if anyone asks, my name's Linda.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.663
I'm a junior at the U. of A.

15:57.099 --> 15:59.374
And you girls are my dorm mates.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.097
Ally, what you looking at?
The boys are over there.

16:08.148 --> 16:09.043
Sorry.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.879
Lyla, I'm worried about you, worried about this plan.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.923
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control.

16:25.249 --> 16:26.290
You okay?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.833
You look like you've seen a ghost.

16:31.236 --> 16:32.404
Tell me something.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.114
What's it like to be drunk?

16:36.135 --> 16:37.556
Uh, what do you mean?

16:38.363 --> 16:39.415
What's it like?

16:40.861 --> 16:42.411
It's like what it's like.

16:42.715 --> 16:43.695
You want a sip?

16:45.527 --> 16:46.852
I don't know.

16:48.028 --> 16:49.316
A toast to me.

16:49.694 --> 16:50.643
New beginnings.

17:03.512 --> 17:07.050
You stay in there any longer, you're going to turn into a prune.

17:07.948 --> 17:10.359
A beautiful, naked prune.

17:13.971 --> 17:16.251
How could I not have known she was dead?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.115
I don't know.
You told me her family life was a mess.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.748
It wasn't like they were going to contact you.

17:22.536 --> 17:23.726
You were in college.

17:23.861 --> 17:26.560
You probably weren't reading the papers every day.

17:27.259 --> 17:28.207
It was years ago.

17:28.258 --> 17:29.540
I'm talking about me.

17:30.413 --> 17:34.292
I see the dead. They send me messages.
I'm the one they all come to.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.793
How could I not have known?

17:58.444 --> 17:59.466
What's going on?

17:59.884 --> 18:02.148
They just found Cynthia McCallister's car.

18:07.534 --> 18:09.600
More blood in that car than...

18:12.319 --> 18:14.410
If it all turns out to belong to Cynthia McCallister,

18:14.461 --> 18:18.190
we're going to need to upgrade her from missing teen to homicide victim.

18:18.241 --> 18:21.385
I better put in a call to the Councilman, make him aware.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.504
Where's the body?

18:22.945 --> 18:23.841
I don't know.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.527
I was kind of hoping you could tell me.

19:02.955 --> 19:04.478
I can barely see you.

19:06.862 --> 19:08.266
I can't hear you.

19:10.127 --> 19:12.462
Go find someone else!

19:13.658 --> 19:15.132
Leave me alone!

19:15.639 --> 19:18.510
Shut up!
Go away! I can't hear you!

19:40.546 --> 19:42.130
Well, aren't you the sight.

19:49.412 --> 19:54.249
Katie and Suzannah just took off, so... I guess it's just you and me.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.886
Hey, you okay?

19:59.389 --> 20:00.420
I'm excellent.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.402
I'm actually... excellent.

20:13.791 --> 20:14.897
Got to tell you...

20:15.801 --> 20:19.247
this is not where I expected to spend my last night in Phoenix.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.353
Then don't go.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.052
I got to go.

20:30.953 --> 20:34.243
I'm going to miss you so much.

20:37.171 --> 20:38.174
Me, too.

21:04.158 --> 21:04.953
Anything?

21:06.651 --> 21:08.149
Not about this, no.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.960
I could take you back to the house.

21:12.258 --> 21:15.720
Well, I'm sure I could be just as useless there as I am here.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.213
Okay.

21:19.287 --> 21:21.039
These things were in her car...

21:22.954 --> 21:24.496
the place where she was murdered.

21:24.547 --> 21:27.797
She touched them. They surrounded her,
probably at the moment of her death.

21:27.848 --> 21:32.257
There should be... some kind of energy to these things--

21:32.523 --> 21:35.433
her energy.
They should tell me something about her...

21:36.552 --> 21:38.212
about her last moments, but...

21:38.628 --> 21:40.162
when I hold these things...

21:42.846 --> 21:45.991
Look. I don't mean to pour salt in the wound.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.325
I watched, uh, Dirty Little Darlings IV last night.

21:52.975 --> 21:54.160
Twice actually.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.379
I'm sorry, Allison.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.473
Cynthia McCallister's nowhere in that movie.

22:00.636 --> 22:01.552
Of course not.

22:05.513 --> 22:07.122
Just hung up with Forensics.

22:07.340 --> 22:10.432
Preliminary tests indicate that all the blood in the car is Cynthia's--

22:10.483 --> 22:12.019
over four liters of the stuff.

22:12.070 --> 22:15.201
There's simply no way she would have survived without an immediate transfusion.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.671
We've  checked every hospital in the state-- nothing.

22:17.722 --> 22:18.798
So where does that leave us?

22:18.849 --> 22:21.515
We need to find her body or a weapon, something.

22:21.672 --> 22:23.492
Doesn't do us any good to find the man that killed her

22:23.543 --> 22:25.423
if we can't prove it in a court of law.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.622
The Councilman's office just called.

22:26.673 --> 22:28.299
He's ready whenever you are.

22:28.688 --> 22:30.697
The Councilman agreed to take a polygraph.

22:30.748 --> 22:33.539
You asked the grieving father to take a lie detector test?

22:33.590 --> 22:34.887
It's standard procedure.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.730
He understands that the sooner we can rule out family members, boyfriends,

22:37.781 --> 22:40.265
anyone else around Cynthia that might be considered a suspect,

22:40.316 --> 22:44.870
the sooner we can concentrate our efforts on finding the person that actually did this.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.700
Have you ever stolen money?

22:49.531 --> 22:50.200
No.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.572
Is your name Stuart McCallister?

22:54.556 --> 22:55.371
Yes.

22:56.804 --> 23:00.108
Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of your daughter?

23:01.606 --> 23:02.454
No.

23:03.910 --> 23:06.006
Is your daughter's name Cynthia Marie?

23:07.591 --> 23:08.306
Yes.

23:11.061 --> 23:13.467
Did you have anything to do with her death?

23:19.606 --> 23:22.314
Did you have anything to do with Cynthia's death?

23:24.679 --> 23:26.837
No, I did not.

23:27.969 --> 23:29.017
Nothing whatsoever?

23:30.726 --> 23:32.282
Nothing whatsoever.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.365
Daddy, don't.

24:13.805 --> 24:14.861
Is today Thursday?

24:15.943 --> 24:16.985
Yes, it is.

24:18.496 --> 24:20.741
Is your name Stuart McCallister?

24:21.538 --> 24:22.394
Yes, it is.

24:45.529 --> 24:46.450
Stuart?

24:50.074 --> 24:51.054
Manuel.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.107
It's 9:30 at night, Manuel, we're meeting in the dark.

24:57.158 --> 24:59.698
I'm assuming you've found my daughter's body.

24:59.837 --> 25:02.209
What's left of it.
Do me the courtesy of

25:02.567 --> 25:05.485
telling me quickly.
I'm not keen on theatrics.

25:05.668 --> 25:09.164
We've not found your daughter, that's not why I asked you here.

25:09.456 --> 25:10.208
Sit.

25:10.870 --> 25:11.814
I'm fine.

25:14.357 --> 25:16.839
What are we doing here, Mr. District Attorney?

25:18.117 --> 25:20.137
I've known you a long time, Stuart.

25:20.721 --> 25:23.705
You're speaking of me as if I were the one who died.

25:25.070 --> 25:28.190
One of my investigators has shared with me a certain...

25:28.669 --> 25:29.900
theory of evidence.

25:31.121 --> 25:35.224
Before I commit further resources,
brief other investigators, ask...

25:35.572 --> 25:39.667
others to follow this lead and thereby
make it a matter of public record,

25:40.626 --> 25:44.106
I wanted to give you the opportunity to speak to its... veracity.

25:44.904 --> 25:45.834
Off the record.

25:46.513 --> 25:48.751
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:51.804 --> 25:52.961
I need to know,

25:53.327 --> 25:56.890
is there anything about the nature of your relationship with your daughter

25:56.941 --> 25:59.398
that might be seen as unique or special?

26:21.099 --> 26:22.071
They called you?

26:25.680 --> 26:26.946
They contacted you?

26:29.619 --> 26:30.580
I'm sorry?

26:30.797 --> 26:33.689
She'd been gone two days when I got the first call.

26:33.999 --> 26:36.001
They sent me to one of those...

26:37.377 --> 26:38.774
adult movie stores.

26:38.977 --> 26:40.152
Video stores.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.705
Told me to buy this used DVD...

26:44.541 --> 26:45.389
and watch it.

26:47.236 --> 26:48.905
They wanted $100,000.

27:02.465 --> 27:03.839
And I sent it to them.

27:07.608 --> 27:09.352
And they slaughtered her anyway.

27:10.464 --> 27:11.357
I'm sorry...

27:12.564 --> 27:13.247
I'm lost.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.103
Are you telling me your daughter was kidnapped?

27:15.154 --> 27:17.556
I'm telling you the same thing I told you the first time I came in here--

27:17.607 --> 27:20.457
that my daughter consorted with unsavory people.

27:21.232 --> 27:23.576
And I believe these people are the ones who killed her...

27:23.627 --> 27:27.719
the ones who tricked her into taping us,
the ones who were blackmailing me.

27:29.031 --> 27:33.125
So you're telling me that there's some sort of recording out there?

27:34.444 --> 27:36.806
And that it... documents...

27:37.247 --> 27:39.201
your relationship with your daughter?

27:41.776 --> 27:43.992
I thought we were going to be direct
and honest with each other, Manuel.

27:44.043 --> 27:45.551
Don't get coy on me now.

27:52.618 --> 27:53.649
You're shocked.

27:54.709 --> 27:56.899
My feelings are beside the point, Stuart.

27:56.950 --> 27:59.128
I'm a civilized person, Manuel.

28:01.561 --> 28:03.187
I know what you're thinking.

28:04.018 --> 28:05.011
But I am not...

28:06.092 --> 28:09.239
- the author of this situation.
- You were the parent.

28:12.809 --> 28:14.584
When Cynthia's mother died...

28:16.575 --> 28:17.908
I realized...

28:20.789 --> 28:23.818
giving comfort to an 11-year-old girl...

28:25.138 --> 28:25.875
it's...

28:28.811 --> 28:29.996
it's not really...

28:32.227 --> 28:33.811
something I knew how to do.

28:37.595 --> 28:38.336
But...

28:40.440 --> 28:44.072
she was in such distress.

28:44.134 --> 28:46.054
Did you kill your daughter, Stuart?

28:49.269 --> 28:50.260
Of course not.

28:55.305 --> 28:56.651
I loved my daughter.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.010
Councilman McCallister, where are you going?

29:17.375 --> 29:18.051
Home.

29:20.431 --> 29:21.305
To grieve.

29:21.661 --> 29:24.471
Sir, I don't think I can let you leave.

29:28.832 --> 29:30.726
I don't think you have a choice.

29:32.626 --> 29:35.636
This is America--
you can't charge a man with hearsay.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.115
Good night, Mr. District Attorney.

30:04.947 --> 30:05.979
It's your boss.

30:06.851 --> 30:08.737
He was just here.
We just spoke.

30:09.403 --> 30:11.189
Everything you suspected is true.

30:14.353 --> 30:15.933
So what happens now?

30:16.204 --> 30:17.344
Nothing happens now.

30:17.455 --> 30:19.601
I can't offer your vision as evidence.

30:20.534 --> 30:23.418
And unless and until that DVD surfaces...

30:26.478 --> 30:27.339
I got to go.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.504
I understand.

30:32.279 --> 30:34.015
And the punch line is:

30:35.424 --> 30:36.844
life sucks.

30:42.881 --> 30:44.146
And the joke is?

30:46.533 --> 30:47.731
It's what you said?

30:49.810 --> 30:50.971
His own daughter.

30:55.285 --> 30:56.345
I'm sorry.

30:56.782 --> 30:58.852
And he's going to get away with it.

31:02.265 --> 31:03.390
Why?

31:05.192 --> 31:07.665
Why fill my head with all this ugliness

31:08.392 --> 31:11.368
when it doesn't matter,
when it doesn't do any good?

31:13.943 --> 31:16.031
Why wouldn't Lyla visit me?

31:17.418 --> 31:20.176
Why wouldn't she tell me herself that she's gone?

31:23.877 --> 31:25.113
I don't know, baby.

31:37.673 --> 31:38.354
Joe?

31:38.559 --> 31:39.551
Joe?

31:40.161 --> 31:41.390
Joe? Joe?

31:42.415 --> 31:43.024
Joe!

31:43.617 --> 31:45.439
What?! What?!
What is it?

31:45.611 --> 31:48.319
We just had an earthquake.
Didn't you feel that?

31:48.907 --> 31:49.729
No.

31:50.039 --> 31:52.059
All I feel is you shaking me awake.

31:53.033 --> 31:54.449
I don't hear the girls.

31:55.111 --> 31:56.677
I don't hear any sirens.

31:57.318 --> 31:59.354
- I'm telling you, we had an earthquake.
- Power's on.

31:59.405 --> 32:01.700
I've been dreaming about it for days and we finally had one.

32:01.751 --> 32:04.882
I had a glass of water on the bedside table beside me and it's filled to the top.

32:04.933 --> 32:06.257
Not a drop is missing.

32:06.783 --> 32:09.301
Fine, don't believe me.
I'm putting on the news.

32:09.352 --> 32:10.479
Excuse me?

32:10.546 --> 32:12.576
You'll see.
It'll be on the news.

32:14.648 --> 32:17.508
And in the small Arizona border town of San Miguel,

32:17.559 --> 32:22.488
residents are applauding the selfless actions of local teacher, Geraldine Hanscom.

32:22.795 --> 32:23.632
Earlier this week,

32:23.683 --> 32:28.418
the very shy Ms. Hanscom not only risked her life to save a young girl from drowning,

32:28.696 --> 32:30.596
They're going to put one of those little banners across the bottom.

32:30.647 --> 32:33.783
but actually turned down a generous cash reward offered to her by the girl's parents.

32:33.834 --> 32:34.434
Instead,

32:34.456 --> 32:38.815
Ms. Hanscom asked that the money be donated to the local San Miguel High School

32:38.991 --> 32:42.057
where she teaches English to teenage migrant workers.

32:42.681 --> 32:43.403
Three days ago,

32:43.454 --> 32:46.933
Ms. Hanscom nearly lost her own life while rescuing a young girl

32:46.984 --> 32:49.444
who had fallen into a flash-flooded river.

32:49.637 --> 32:52.337
Floods don't count, we're looking for earthquakes.

32:53.315 --> 32:54.039
Ow.

32:55.674 --> 32:56.479
It's her.

32:57.597 --> 32:58.799
Joe, it's Lyla.

32:59.503 --> 33:01.305
That's her.
She's still alive.

33:01.626 --> 33:02.728
Lyla Gallagher?

33:03.884 --> 33:05.173
How's that possible?

33:05.491 --> 33:06.433
I don't know.

33:07.810 --> 33:10.668
But when I get a chance, I'm going to go ask her.

33:15.738 --> 33:18.354
You're trespassing, and I will call the sheriff.

33:18.731 --> 33:19.967
How do I get you people to understand

33:20.018 --> 33:22.704
I have no interest in being in the paper or on television.

33:22.755 --> 33:25.008
Lyla, it's me.

33:25.059 --> 33:27.040
It's Allison.
It's Allison Rolen.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.443
Oh, my God. Allison.

33:37.119 --> 33:38.111
Oh, crap.

33:45.198 --> 33:46.430
They're so beautiful.

33:47.949 --> 33:49.051
What about you?

33:50.292 --> 33:54.711
I have 23 of them, and they'll be here in about ten minutes.

33:55.709 --> 33:57.182
I saw you on television.

33:57.233 --> 34:00.864
Well, I saw Geraldine Hanscom on television.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.323
I was looking for you.

34:05.945 --> 34:06.669
Okay.

34:11.076 --> 34:12.525
It's flattering, I guess.

34:17.495 --> 34:19.431
But I need you to leave me alone.

34:20.487 --> 34:21.297
What?

34:22.516 --> 34:23.491
Why?

34:23.571 --> 34:26.831
Lyla... the whole world thinks you're dead.

34:27.007 --> 34:31.817
I know, and it took a lot of time, luck and money to make it happen.

34:34.857 --> 34:36.735
So, please, Allison, just go home.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.393
Not without a why.

34:39.717 --> 34:41.504
Not without an answer.

34:42.224 --> 34:44.187
I drove all night to get here.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.168
I'm not going home empty-handed.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.079
You ever made a mistake?

34:52.928 --> 34:56.507
When I left Phoenix and came to California, I made a lot of them.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.378
I even married one of them.

34:59.953 --> 35:03.701
Did a lot of really stupid things with a lot of really stupid people.

35:04.316 --> 35:05.575
Did a lot for money.

35:07.282 --> 35:09.269
Took a lot of really stupid drugs.

35:10.384 --> 35:12.396
Made a lot of really stupid choices.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.936
It just got really dark.

35:17.163 --> 35:18.965
The truth is I wanted to die...

35:20.676 --> 35:25.542
and I realize now I did everything short of actually killing myself to make it happen.

35:27.239 --> 35:29.343
My husband Billy and I were up north.

35:30.236 --> 35:31.980
We were driving through Oakland.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.419
We got into this enormous fight--
something about drugs.

35:34.470 --> 35:36.335
I took his, he took mine.

35:37.427 --> 35:41.221
We needed money, and I was in no shape to do what was necessary to get it.

35:41.272 --> 35:44.024
Anyway, he throws me out of his car.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.387
I mean, I'm in the middle of Oakland with nothing.

35:50.622 --> 35:53.057
It's October 17, 1989.

35:54.724 --> 35:56.904
20 minutes later, the whole place shook.

35:57.649 --> 35:59.200
It was a 7.1 earthquake.

35:59.759 --> 36:00.757
I remember it.

36:01.575 --> 36:02.672
I read about it.

36:02.939 --> 36:04.549
Me, too, the next day.

36:06.189 --> 36:07.513
I was in this shelter.

36:08.789 --> 36:10.157
I saw this paper.

36:10.482 --> 36:12.116
There's a list of the dead.

36:13.043 --> 36:14.761
Me and my husband were on it.

36:16.083 --> 36:19.227
My wallet, my bag, everything I owned was in Billy's car.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.957
Billy's car went off the Oakland Bay Bridge during the quake.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.208
Oh, my God.

36:24.623 --> 36:26.249
At first, I was frantic.

36:27.116 --> 36:28.694
Everyone thinks I'm dead.

36:29.275 --> 36:30.439
This is horrible.

36:33.496 --> 36:35.014
But then I realized...

36:36.633 --> 36:37.567
no.

36:39.131 --> 36:41.017
This is the chance of a lifetime.

36:42.432 --> 36:44.662
This is the chance of a second lifetime.

36:44.975 --> 36:47.095
I don't get it.
How did you do it?

36:47.340 --> 36:51.274
A new name?
A new social security number?

36:53.969 --> 36:55.033
There's this guy.

36:55.273 --> 36:56.379
His name's Sammy.

36:56.490 --> 36:58.468
He works out of a room in Nogales.

36:59.221 --> 37:01.107
He can get you anything you need.

37:01.162 --> 37:02.557
The ultimate do-over.

37:04.254 --> 37:06.781
The only thing is it costs $100,000.

37:08.276 --> 37:10.716
Took me five years to work it off.

37:12.551 --> 37:16.018
I answered phones.

37:16.554 --> 37:18.002
I made deliveries.

37:18.443 --> 37:20.447
Got my teaching certificate at night.

37:23.705 --> 37:25.373
But I would've done anything.

37:26.752 --> 37:28.935
I was so happy being Gerry Hanscom.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.918
It was like being born again...

37:33.093 --> 37:35.201
like being present for my own birth.

37:36.231 --> 37:38.847
I don't understand.
So this guy gives people...

37:39.293 --> 37:40.250
new lives?

37:42.201 --> 37:44.741
But what if you're not in a natural disaster?

37:46.243 --> 37:48.134
How do you get the death certificate?

37:48.185 --> 37:51.799
For another $100,000, Sammy could tell you how to handle that, too.

37:51.857 --> 37:56.432
All you need is a year, a box of hypodermic needles and a portable freezer.

37:56.969 --> 37:58.033
What do you mean?

37:58.996 --> 38:01.578
He'd teach you how to collect your own blood--

38:01.757 --> 38:04.171
a pint or so every week or two.
Store it.

38:04.270 --> 38:05.330
Keep it cold.

38:05.826 --> 38:10.489
When you figured out where you want to die, dump the blood and make a real mess.

38:11.434 --> 38:13.685
There isn't a coroner anywhere

38:14.222 --> 38:18.364
who won't declare you legally dead if he sees at least four liters of blood.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.301
Four liters, huh?

38:20.928 --> 38:22.915
Four liters is the magic number.

38:25.317 --> 38:26.943
And you worked for this guy?

38:27.144 --> 38:27.756
Yeah.

38:29.265 --> 38:29.912
Why?

38:30.307 --> 38:33.899
Because I need you to do me a favor.

38:39.226 --> 38:39.952
Cynthia?

38:42.406 --> 38:43.164
Maybe.

38:46.510 --> 38:47.658
You work for Sammy?

38:49.506 --> 38:50.696
Are those my papers?

38:50.954 --> 38:52.446
My name is Allison Dubois.

38:54.587 --> 38:59.015
I work for the Phoenix District Attorney's Office, and, yeah, these are your papers.

38:59.295 --> 38:59.933
Unfortunately,

38:59.984 --> 39:03.916
I'm going to need to hang onto these as evidence in a trial against you

39:04.173 --> 39:06.293
on charges of blackmail and fraud.

39:13.129 --> 39:14.671
Did you do it by yourself?

39:17.006 --> 39:18.279
Pretty much.

39:20.085 --> 39:20.823
I, uh...

39:22.209 --> 39:25.769
I paid a vagrant ten dollars to put the disc in the case at the video store,

39:25.820 --> 39:30.247
and I hired another guy for 20 to make the phone call to my dad.

39:34.177 --> 39:37.757
If you're working for my father, you're in league with the devil.

39:39.218 --> 39:40.970
So long as you understand that.

39:41.870 --> 39:43.741
I have a pretty good idea...

39:44.602 --> 39:45.976
of what he did to you.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.796
You don't know the half of it.

39:56.343 --> 39:57.701
Pretty screwed-up world.

39:58.699 --> 40:00.416
After everything that he did,

40:01.908 --> 40:04.435
I'll rot in a jail cell, and he'll be walking free.

40:04.486 --> 40:07.438
Not necessarily.
He said that there was some recording.

40:08.060 --> 40:11.556
- If we could get our hands on that...
- I was 19 on that DVD.

40:13.784 --> 40:16.140
He'll argue that there was implied consent.

40:21.416 --> 40:27.492
Unfortunately, I wasn't smart enough to tape us when I was 11...

40:29.100 --> 40:30.445
or 12 or...

40:41.790 --> 40:45.094
Hang onto these papers, Elizabeth.
You're going to need them.

40:48.135 --> 40:50.365
I'm sorry I bothered you.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.898
I thought you were someone else, another girl.

40:54.216 --> 40:58.522
I heard she was dead, but when I saw you, I thought maybe.

41:02.215 --> 41:03.747
I guess I was wrong.

41:05.722 --> 41:07.540
How far are we from the border here?

41:07.591 --> 41:08.744
Half a mile?

41:10.123 --> 41:13.669
With the right papers, a person could safely get across the border in 15 minutes,

41:13.720 --> 41:18.042
so even if a person did mistakenly spot you and happen to call the authorities,

41:18.168 --> 41:20.865
you could be safely gone before they arrived.

41:21.808 --> 41:22.542
Go.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.179
I got the check.

41:33.630 --> 41:36.120
You make sure that the right people see that.

41:37.943 --> 41:39.033
The girl on it...

41:40.837 --> 41:41.806
she's dead...

41:42.371 --> 41:43.259
but the man...

41:47.098 --> 41:47.968
Don't worry.

41:49.117 --> 41:50.793
I know what to do with this.

42:00.581 --> 42:01.303
Coffee?

42:01.354 --> 42:03.721
No, I'm fine.
Just-just the check.

42:04.351 --> 42:06.913
Hopefully everything met your expectations.

42:09.557 --> 42:10.345
Oh, yeah.

42:13.434 --> 42:15.130
Everything was perfect.

42:34.363 --> 42:37.331
