02:15.700 --> 02:18.600
Why the barrier? Is this new?

02:18.600 --> 02:21.400
Toll privileges are issued
by the Princess...
2.1
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,200
...or the young Baron.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Is the old one dead?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
Pity.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.500
These your horses?
You need a permit.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.300
A permit? I've crossed 
20 times with no permit.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.000
No one passes without a permit.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.300
Get a permit, or go back.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.000
I'm taking them to the fair.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.600
30... and you can have them.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
It's already low.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.700
I paid 20 pounds 6 months ago.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
He mustn't pass with no permit.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.600
Seriously?... for a permit?

04:05.600 --> 04:09.700
He can leave 2 black horses
(for collateral)

04:09.900 --> 04:12.300
He'll get them back
when he gets a permit.

04:12.300 --> 04:16.000
My horses? That's harsh!
I have to sell them.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.000
Alright...
He can leave the black ones.

05:12.900 --> 05:17.800
Cesar, watch my horses
till I get back.
19.1
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,800
[ Michael Kohlhaas ]
19.2
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,300
[ Based on a story by 
Heinrich von Kleist ]

06:18.600 --> 06:21.200
Where are the horses?

06:27.300 --> 06:30.000
The two black ones.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.000
Kohlhaas.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
Governor.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.000
Magnificent!

08:30.500 --> 08:32.000
He's superb.

08:37.500 --> 08:42.299
He's truly exceptional.
I don't know how you do it.

08:42.500 --> 08:47.000
Any other horse trader
would have kept him, but you...

08:47.100 --> 08:50.900
You want to bankrupt (murder) me?
Is that it?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.400
What are you up to?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.000
Who told you to take them out?

09:13.300 --> 09:14.600
Thief.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.800
Release the dogs.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Isn't that the Bible?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
You don't read out loud?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
It's the Bible. But not in Latin.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Would you like to read?

10:24.500 --> 10:40.000
<i>A - tra-vers - le - verre - sombre</i>
Through a glass darkly

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Through a glass, darkly.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.000
It's an image.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.000
A way of seeing the world.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Darkly.

11:07.300 --> 11:12.400
Something you see,
but don't recognise.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.900
An enemy.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.300
Or a friend.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.700
Or oneself.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I have something for you.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
I don't dare look.

14:33.500 --> 14:38.000
You know what I thought,
the first time I saw you?

14:38.500 --> 14:41.500
If I could touch that man...

14:41.500 --> 14:44.000
... just once.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.000
He's so handsome...

14:50.600 --> 14:55.100
...I'd drink his tenderness
even from a pig's trough.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.000
You're blushing.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.500
Are you going to make love?

16:00.200 --> 16:04.500
Mom says I shouldn't pretend
to sleep when I hear you.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.000
I heard you.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.800
Who did this?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.800
Where's my groom?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.500
He left.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.000
We looked after them ourselves.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.500
Made them work to pay for
their keep.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.500
What happened to him?

18:29.500 --> 18:32.000
He ran off with the horses,
that's what!

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
We caught the horses,
but he got away.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.800
I don't believe you.

18:39.900 --> 18:44.000
You don't?... Believe what you like.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.000
I seek my horses, my lord.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.000
Two black saddle horses...

19:44.000 --> 19:45.500
...left with you as a guarantee.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.000
They're in the stable.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
He just saw them.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.500
He's making a big fuss because
they're dirty and we made them work.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Those are not my horses.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.500
I left you two magnificent animals

19:58.500 --> 20:01.000
well-fed and in good health.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.500
I want my horses as they were.

20:29.500 --> 20:34.000
My lord! The Princess no longer
grants toll privileges.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.000
You mocked me.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Now I want my horses.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I will have justice, my lord.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.000
Why, exactly, are you giving me
this money?

21:13.500 --> 21:15.000
Show him.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.000
I want you to lodge a complaint
before the tribunal.

22:15.500 --> 22:21.000
Demand redress for damages
suffered by Cesar and myself.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.300
Toll rights are abolished.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.600
The Chancellery confirmed it.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.500
Cesar has always been in my service.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.500
They set the dogs on him.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.200
I'll leave you to estimate
the value of the damages.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And say that I want my horses
as they were.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.500
Well-fed and in perfect health.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.200
It's a colt. (male)

24:10.800 --> 24:12.500
From your mare.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.000
Watch.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.500
He's going to stand.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.000
I've come from the tribunal.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Your claim was rejected.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.500
It's the third time.
There won't be another.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.500
The Baron who wronged you...

24:52.500 --> 24:55.500
...is related to a gentleman
of the Court.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.300
I recommend
you take those horses back.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.700
Why don't you dismount?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.000
I can't stay.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I must be off again.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.400
Won't you eat something?

25:11.500 --> 25:13.000
Please...

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
Don't insist.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.300
Do we end it here?

25:25.500 --> 25:27.000
Kohlhaas...

25:27.500 --> 25:31.600
Is your business so fragile
that you can't lose 2 horses?

25:31.600 --> 25:32.900
Why don't you answer?

25:32.900 --> 25:34.000
Go get your horses.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
WHICH horses?

25:36.500 --> 25:38.000
Those half dead animals...

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
...that I left 3 months ago?

25:42.200 --> 25:46.000
I'd rather you left me out of this.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Mom, come see.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.200
We consider the horse dealer,
118.1
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,500
Michael Kohlhaas,
to be a litigious person,

26:35.500 --> 26:38.000
Lord DeJacques,
with whom he left his horses,
119.1
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,500
is not keeping them from him.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.500
Said dealer may 
retrieve them or indicate

26:43.500 --> 26:46.025
to the Lord where to deliver them.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.800
We dismiss Michael Kohlhaas'
122.1
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,200
foolhardy, vexatious litigation 

26:51.200 --> 26:53.500
and instruct him not to importune 
123.1
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,100
the Chancellery with such suits,

26:56.100 --> 26:58.000
upon pain of encarceration.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.500
Selling your estate?

27:28.500 --> 27:32.000
If you buy now, I won't haggle.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.500
How much will you give me
for all of it?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
All of what?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
All of it.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
The land. The house.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.200
Is it true, what Cesar says?

28:23.000 --> 28:27.800
That you want to bring your
grievance to the Princess?

28:31.300 --> 28:35.300
That you're selling the house?

28:35.500 --> 28:39.000
Are you getting rid of us?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Judith.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
God gave me a wife...

28:46.500 --> 28:48.000
children...

28:48.500 --> 28:52.000
whom I love more than anything.

28:52.700 --> 28:57.500
Do you want me to regret that
for the first time in my life?

29:05.500 --> 29:08.000
What should I do?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Offer an apology to the Baron?

29:47.300 --> 29:49.700
Give me the case.

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
Let me go.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
Judith...

29:51.800 --> 29:54.500
The Princess is surrounded by people.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
How do you plan to get through?

29:56.500 --> 29:58.000
With a sword?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.300
The people around a Princess
is called a Court.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
If you really want
your grievance to succeed...

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
...my love...

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
...let me go.

31:21.900 --> 31:24.500
Walk back home with the mare.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.800
I can go faster without you.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Lord...

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
Lord of lords...

36:19.500 --> 36:22.000
who knows the thoughts of men

36:23.000 --> 36:28.500
Creator of thunder, of lightning, of fog

36:28.500 --> 36:32.700
of the wind, the snow, and the rain

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
You who makes transient beings,
you sustain them and destroy them

36:43.000 --> 36:45.500
Receive the soul of Judith.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Receive the soul of Judith.

36:49.500 --> 36:54.000
Sprinkle her with the dew of Thy Grace.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
Sprinkle her with the dew of Thy Grace.

36:57.500 --> 37:01.000
Beneath the shade of Thy wings.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Beneath the shade of Thy wings.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Lord, I feel much sorrow for Judith.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Lord...

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Let her dwell with You.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Amen.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.300
I could stay in the house...

38:27.300 --> 38:29.000
Lisbeth.

38:31.800 --> 38:35.500
When it's all over,
I'll come for you.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.000
I promise.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Allez, allez!

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
The Bible says to forgive our enemies.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
I pray that God
will never forgive us...

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
...as we're going to
'forgive' our young lord.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.000
Get dressed.

45:39.500 --> 45:42.000
Put it down.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.000
Take this.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
The Baron's on foot.
He can't be far.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.300
They want to follow us.

48:55.300 --> 48:58.000
What do you say?

49:13.200 --> 49:17.700
[OCCITAN]
I've come, Senor Kohlhaas

49:17.700 --> 49:20.498
to offer my respects.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.620
One man and his horse
against the whole world.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.900
That's very strong!

49:28.901 --> 49:30.500
I too...

49:30.500 --> 49:34.000
I too broke the law.
189.1
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,000
Hey, shush, shh!

49:38.700 --> 49:41.850
Listen, listen! I too broke the law.

49:41.850 --> 49:44.300
Occasionally, like all men.

49:44.300 --> 49:48.400
I mean, if there was a just God...

49:48.400 --> 49:50.700
I don't know what would happen.

49:50.700 --> 49:54.600
If I weigh in the balance...

49:54.617 --> 49:56.800
what I did...

49:56.952 --> 49:57.800
against...

49:58.129 --> 50:00.096
what was done to me...

50:00.706 --> 50:02.248
Look, look!

50:03.417 --> 50:05.752
We've reached Senor Kohlhaas.

50:28.776 --> 50:30.235
It's for you.

50:30.403 --> 50:33.700
You need to wait a bit,
but he'll fatten up.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.500
How much did you pay?[FREN]

50:36.500 --> 50:39.100
No, nothing. It's a gift.[OC]

50:39.100 --> 50:41.300
Kohlhaas doesn't accept gifts.[FR]

50:41.300 --> 50:43.500
We'll pay you.

50:57.550 --> 51:00.000
Who here, can fight?

51:04.600 --> 51:07.500
Who's been to war before?

51:12.200 --> 51:18.100
You know what the Lords do
to peasants who revolt?

51:18.200 --> 51:21.000
They cut off your fingers.

51:22.500 --> 51:25.000
They gouge out your eyes.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.000
They torture you slowly.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
It lasts a day.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.000
The death of a peasant is a joke.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.000
I was a soldier.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.000
I know what I'm talking about.

51:48.200 --> 51:49.500
You, the big one, come with me.

51:49.500 --> 51:52.000
The rest, go home.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.500
Eh, I...[OC]

52:00.701 --> 52:03.500
I... I can fight.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Show me.[FR]

52:14.840 --> 52:16.925
I want to learn.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.429
I have to see Sir Kohlhaas.[OC]

52:24.225 --> 52:25.308
It's important.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
You brought the pig.
I haven't forgotten.[FR]

52:29.730 --> 52:32.500
The Baron...

52:41.700 --> 52:42.000
The Baron...

52:43.702 --> 52:45.078
I know where he is.[OC]

55:58.500 --> 56:02.000
When I was a child,
a revolt broke out

56:02.000 --> 56:05.500
in a neighbouring province
a fair distance away.

56:05.500 --> 56:09.000
And one day, a beggar
who had crossed said province

56:09.000 --> 56:12.800
brought into my father's house
a rebel's manifesto.

56:13.300 --> 56:15.800
It was a feast day.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.000
Guests in every room.

56:18.500 --> 56:21.000
The priest read the first article

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
and everyone starts to laugh.

56:24.500 --> 56:27.000
My father tears up the manifesto

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
and chases off the beggar,
with a stick.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.500
Why?

56:31.500 --> 56:34.500
The peasants complained,
in those 12 articles,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.500
that they counted less than
our dogs.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.000
I was 12 years old.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
The great peasant rebellion
happened a month later.

56:43.500 --> 56:46.000
My father lost his life.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Three of our family's manors
were burned and demolished.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.500
Tell the governor,
it's the best I could find.

57:05.500 --> 57:08.000
Hurry, and speak to no one.

57:27.500 --> 57:31.000
What are you waiting for?
 Hurry up.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
Judith's grave is in bloom.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Thank you.

59:20.500 --> 59:23.000
The neighbour doesn't want
the house anymore.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
He's keeping it for you.

59:25.300 --> 59:28.300
You can buy back the land
if you want.

59:40.500 --> 59:43.500
You know, I can't stay with you.

59:44.500 --> 59:47.000
I know.

59:51.200 --> 59:54.000
What do you want me to do?

59:56.200 --> 59:58.500
Go home.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.300
What'll you do about her?

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.000
She's my daughter.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.800
Any news from home?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
No one judges you.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Not one word against you.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And you?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
How do you judge me?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.000
The Baron just left the Abbey.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.000
Are you at war because of mom?

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.000
No.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.300
Because of the horses?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
No.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.000
Cesar!

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.000
Two squads.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.500
Eighteen men.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.000
'My' men.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.300
We do not take.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.500
We buy.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.200
We pay...

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
...the rightful owner.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.700
And we accept no gifts.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
People give because they're afraid.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.000
War does not give us the right...

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.500
...to pillage...

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.000
...to steal.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.399
That's what the Lords do.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.000
Not us.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.000
Come forward.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.000
Your house was pillaged.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:44.000
Show me who did it.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.000
Do you want to say anything?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Is that your idea of justice?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Hanging your own men.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.000
Is that why you burn and massacre?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Looks like you're preparing
to ravage an whole town.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.400
All these people
you're dragging into war,...

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.100
do they know what awaits them?

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.000
What did you tell them?

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.500
That Kohlhaas is the victim
of a great injustice?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.500
You're a merchant.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.500
You're business is prosperous.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
For you, life is sweet.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.500
What effort did you make
to obtain justice?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I see that your heart is rancorous.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.000
That you're dragging all these people...

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:53.000
...into a war that doesn't concern them.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.000
I see that the sword that you wield
is not the sword of justice.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.000
That you're not a soldier of God.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.500
God has been largely forgotten...

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:13.000
...in this whole enterprise.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.500
Kohlhaas...

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
What awaits you on earth
is the gallows.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.000
All of you, know very well
what awaits you.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:35.500
It's an honour, for me,
to make your acquaintance.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.700
You know me?

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500
I've read your Bible...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and I read it to my children.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.700
If everyone did as you do...

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
there'd be neither order,
nor justice.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.200
What would you yourself do...

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.700
...if, among your own troops

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
everyone wanted to be independent,
to make his own justice...

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
...and avenge himself?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
You'd say it's up to
superiors to judge.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.600
That no one may be the judge
of his own cause.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.000
God would help you...

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
if you knew how to suffer
as He asks you to.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.500
If you learned to endure
and to suffer injustice.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.000
Don't you know, yet,
that it's unfitting...

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.300
for a Christian to fight with
sword and arquebus...

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.000
...but with the cross
and with patience?

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:45.500
That his triumph is neither
domination nor power...

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.000
...but submission and humility?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.800
I spent my life convincing
the Church and the Princes...

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.900
..that they had no reason
to fear us.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.500
All we asked was to be able to
live and prosper alongside them.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.700
Your rebellion...

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
...has set back our cause.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.000
The woman...

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
that I loved

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.500
who bore my children

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:32.000
went to the palace of the Princess

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.500
to beg

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
that I be given the justice
rightfully mine.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.000
Lay down your arms.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.500
If the Baron looks after my horses — 

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.000
In the name of your faith,
and of your children!

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:16.800
— with his own hands.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.000
Of all children raised by
our principles!

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
If he returns my horses
in good health

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.500
I'll lay down my arms.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.500
And if not?

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.000
You say you grieve
the loss of your wife.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.000
That you are inconsolable.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.500
Don't you know the means
of defeating death?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Every living species has them...

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.000
...from ant, to man.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.500
You...

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.000
You have the simplest:

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
"Thou shalt not kill".

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Death is a choice.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.000
Whoever doesn't kill, doesn't die.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.000
What you must consider today

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.500
is not your strength, which is great.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Nor the fault of your adversary,
which is undeniable.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:40.000
I only ask you to see whether...

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
...what you're about to do
agrees with justice

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and with your conscience.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.000
It's all well and good...

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.990
to fire words, like arrows,
at these wretches.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.500
Doesn't it occur to you
to think of your own end?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.500
Of the child you'll leave behind?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Of the thoughts that will
no longer inhabit you?

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.800
Don't forget...

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.500
you die alone.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
You had this all along.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.000
The Princess is negotiating.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.500
Not me.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.000
I ask nothing more
than what is written.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.300
I'd rather you accepted
the spirit of the Scriptures

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.000
and not the Princess' arguments.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.000
Will you hear my confession?

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.000
Go down on your knees.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.000
Are you ready to forgive your enemy,

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.800
to retrieve your horses,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
to bring them home
and care for them?

01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:03.000
I'm ready to forgive those
who wronged me, unknowingly.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.500
But...

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.500
The Baron...

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.000
Let me demand that he restore
my horses with his own hands.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.000
Pastor

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You deny me peace?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.500
With God, yes.

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.400
With the Princess,
it's in your own hands.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:55.500
We, Princess of Angoulême,
Queen of Navarre, sister of the King

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.800
bestow upon Michael Kohlhaas a pass  

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
for a new inquiry into his case

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
on condition that he lay down his arms.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.000
Should the tribunal reject his claim,

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:24.500
Kohlhaas will submit to the penalty
for taking justice into his own hands.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.800
If on the other hand, the
tribunal finds him in the right

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
he and his troops shall be pardoned

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and be granted amnesty for the crimes
of which he is guilty in the land.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.500
I saw injustice.
That's why I took up arms.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
They can have my arms.
There'll be no more fighting.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.000
Everybody go home.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
No one will die today.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.500
What about those already dead?

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.000
Cesar?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Amnesty!

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:18.000
We surrender our arms!

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.500
Surrender arms!

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Everyone!

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Have you turned in your weapons?

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.500
I did.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.500
Do you have children?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.500
No.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.500
A wife?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.500
No.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
You've kept nothing?
You're certain?

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.000
I have nothing left.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.500
That's good.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.000
I don't know where to go.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.000
Do you know where Jeremie is?

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.000
Do you know where he's going?

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.000
Michael Kohlhaas?

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.000
Majesty.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.000
Do you know who I am?

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.000
My father called you "Majesty".

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.000
Your mother was harmed in my palace.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Would you believe me,
if I said I was sorry?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.200
Do you think it's my fault?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
The town you were about to destroy
before you surrendered your arms...

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.000
I was there.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I had barely as many men as you.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:47.600
You could have taken a lot more.
Why did you surrender your arms?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.500
I don't want a lot more, Majesty.
Only what is my due.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.000
Are you a fanatic?

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
I have principles.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
A relative of the Baron used his
position to make your claim disappear.

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.000
Did you know?

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.000
Yes.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
You are like me.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
You live as much by the love
as by the fear you inspire.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.500
If you inspire only fear,
everyone despises you.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.000
Only love...

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.000
is sign of weakness.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.000
I suspect you're alone...

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.000
disarmed...

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.500
you have a child.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I'd like you to accept a guard.

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.500
Your Majesty, I don't —

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.500
A few men, for your safety.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.000
Until the trial.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.000
The Baron may have found your horses.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.300
In a bad state, but alive.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.000
Go and identify them.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.000
The court will have them restored
to you in their original state.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.000
You'll have what you wanted.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You prepared four?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
There will be four.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.500
Two mares... two foals.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Is that why you got out the harness?
Are we going to the fair?

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.500
We're waiting for more men.
They'll be coming with us.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.500
You're afraid for me.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I don't know. Those are the orders.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.500
You know your orders.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I do as I please.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
One of your men did not
surrender his weapons.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Two nobles were killed,
their property stolen

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.900
and distributed to the peasants.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.500
I don't have any men.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.000
There's an inquest.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.700
The Princess gave me her word.

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:04.000
The Princess considers the amnesty broken.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Does that make me a prisoner?

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.000
Get down.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Lisbeth.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Let's go.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.000
Where is the house?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
We're going in exactly
in the opposite direction.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.000
Lisbeth!

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Eat.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.000
I'll have to live with my aunt.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.500
You can't live alone, Lisbeth.

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.000
I don't even know her.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I know her.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.000
How about the house?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
What ABOUT the house?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
What if I go live there?

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.000
Lisbeth

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
that's not possible.

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.500
Apples...

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
...from your home.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
The neighbour agreed.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.500
I spoke with him.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.000
He wrote you a letter with the details.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Here, at any given moment,
people start praying.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The bell rings, and they kneel.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500
All at the same time.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.500
I had forgotten.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Only the Jews and us remain standing.

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:50.000
What's coming...

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.000
will be hard.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.500
I have difficulty finding...

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I don't know...

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.000
the words.

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:16.000
The Princess intervened.

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.200
[GERMAN]
I won't be tortured.

01:44:28.104 --> 01:44:29.996
or flayed,

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.857
or burned.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:34.851
Thank God.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.580
Do you know anything else?

01:44:38.581 --> 01:44:39.622
Yes.

01:44:40.816 --> 01:44:42.617
Do you want to tell me?

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:48.873
No.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:01.300
The worst is the certainty.[FREN]

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.000
I count.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Every day, I'm getting closer to Judith.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
And further from Lisbeth.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.000
It's not death.
Death, I'm used to.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I believe.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:33.300
But the absolute certitude of
the day, the hour, the manner...

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.000
is the most difficult.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:53.000
Kohlhaas...

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:06.000
In the name of Marguerite,
Princess of Angoulême

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:11.500
Queen of Navarre

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
sister of the King,

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:24.000
today I dispense the justice
which you called upon yourself.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
We return what was
taken from you, by force.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Your horses.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:06.000
Compensation money
for your manservant.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:24.000
Cesar had no family.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:29.000
Give this to someone who needs it.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Reparation money for you.

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:32.000
Two years in prison
for what he did to you.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
You have what you wanted.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
The black horses are for you.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Lisbeth...

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:30.000
I know you're angry.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.000
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:56.000
I was fortunate to have you.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:00.000
You're very brave.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
You're hurting my fingers.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.000
I want to go.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Now.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Go with her.

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.000
Are we waiting for something?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
No.

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.000
Michael Kohlhaas...

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:27.000
your rights having been restored
in the preceding fashion;

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.500
for your part in violating civil
peace, may God prepare you, now

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:37.300
to restore the right
of His Majesty the King

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.500
whose legal representative
is here present.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:58.000
I'm ready.

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:03.000
