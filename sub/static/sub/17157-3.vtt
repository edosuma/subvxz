10:12.933 --> 10:17.567
- Correct.

10:17.567 --> 10:20.267
Oh, hey, Principal Mullins.

10:20.267 --> 10:23.033
This day just gets
better and better.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.267
- Well, don't mind me.
I just saw your lecture

10:25.267 --> 10:28.233
on Lawrence's wonderful camera,

10:28.233 --> 10:29.900
and I had to hear for myself.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.633
- Oh. Well, we were just
discussing historical stuff,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.367
things that happened in history,

10:35.367 --> 10:39.667
and the dates when they
happened, historically.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.133
- Well, pretend I'm not here.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.233
I would watch from my office
if the camera had sound.

10:43.233 --> 10:46.133
- They do. You just
have to flip one switch.

10:47.367 --> 10:49.300
- Why?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.767
- So, Vikings,

10:58.767 --> 11:02.400
they had beards and...

11:02.400 --> 11:05.567
mustaches and...

11:05.567 --> 11:07.800
hats with horns.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.500
They fought in the battle of--
[coughs and mutters]

11:11.500 --> 11:13.767
Let me point it out to you
over here on this map of--

11:13.767 --> 11:16.333
[coughs]

11:20.500 --> 11:21.767
[bell rings]

11:21.767 --> 11:23.267
- Oh, thank God--

11:23.267 --> 11:26.233
for the opportunity
to bestow wisdom

11:26.233 --> 11:28.833
in this great school
with cameras everywhere

11:28.833 --> 11:31.833
that I'm totally cool with.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.833
[rock music]

11:34.833 --> 11:36.267
- I can't do this.

11:36.267 --> 11:38.100
They expect me to stand
in front of a classroom

11:38.100 --> 11:41.833
and just know things
and make sense for hours?

11:41.833 --> 11:43.467
What kind of a job is that?

11:43.467 --> 11:44.867
- Teaching.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.800
- Well, it's insane.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.267
Might as well say good-bye
to Battle of the Bands.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.267
I'll be fired
by the end of the day.

11:52.267 --> 11:54.300
- There's got to be a way
to fix this.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.333
- Well...

11:56.333 --> 11:57.200
Never mind.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.267
- You have an idea.

11:58.267 --> 12:01.233
- No, I don't. Ideas are risky.

12:01.233 --> 12:04.233
- Not as risky
as not telling us.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.900
- That sounds like a threat.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.267
- Does it?

12:07.267 --> 12:10.367
- Okay, fine.
It's a tape loop.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.433
We film Mr. Finn teaching us
a brilliant class

12:12.433 --> 12:14.667
and get the footage to play
on Principal Mullins' monitor

12:14.667 --> 12:16.167
over and over.

12:16.167 --> 12:19.800
- Oh, so every time she looks,
she sees us working.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.467
- Meanwhile, we're rocking out.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.067
- We'll shoot it after school.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.433
Awesome idea, Lawrence.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.700
- I do not feel good about it.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.167
[rock music]

12:31.167 --> 12:35.233
- 13.8 billion years ago,

12:35.233 --> 12:39.333
all space was contained
in a single point

12:39.333 --> 12:44.467
from which the universe
has been expanding ever since.

12:44.467 --> 12:48.067
The moment the universe
began expanding,

12:48.067 --> 12:51.767
we call the big bag.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.833
- Big Bang.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.900
- Cut.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.733
- And scientists call that

12:57.733 --> 12:59.833
the big butt theory.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.433
- Cut.

13:01.433 --> 13:04.067
- Scientists call this...

13:04.067 --> 13:06.167
- [mouthing]
- The Big Bang theory.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.600
[all whispering]
Yes.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.067
- I got it right.

13:09.067 --> 13:12.500
- Yeah, not bad for take 73.
- Right?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.767
- Now let's get this footage
into Principal Mullins' server.

13:14.767 --> 13:19.067
- Wait...can I do one more
with a British accent?

13:19.067 --> 13:21.233
all: No.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.367
[rock music]

13:26.800 --> 13:28.300
- Summer, what's up?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.500
- Stupid speed debate.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.333
- Oh, uh, I was just
trying to be polite.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.067
All right, I guess we're
doing this now.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.133
What's bothering you?

13:39.133 --> 13:40.500
- I have to win
the debate tomorrow,

13:40.500 --> 13:41.767
or Clark will become captain,

13:41.767 --> 13:43.567
and I will never hear
the end of it.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.900
But I can't talk fast,
I mean, at all.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.633
I've tried everything I could
think of and nothing's wor--

13:49.700 --> 13:51.067
Mr. Finn.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.300
- Sorry.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.567
I figured I could get my coffee

13:53.567 --> 13:56.133
and you'd still be going
when I got back.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.667
- Forget it.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.700
- Don't worry.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.200
I actually have an awesome idea

14:02.200 --> 14:05.233
that will make you
the queen of speed debate.

14:05.233 --> 14:08.933
If you want to flow,
you just have to feel the beat.

14:08.933 --> 14:11.367
Check out how fast
these guys rap.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.467
[instrumental rap music]
- [chuckles]

14:14.467 --> 14:17.400
Yeah. Now try some
of your debating.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.067
- * America is a melting pot

14:20.067 --> 14:23.767
* 98% of Americans are either
immigrants or the descendents *

14:23.767 --> 14:26.567
* Yeah so why don't we
allow foreign-born citizens *

14:26.567 --> 14:28.067
*To serve as the President *
* Uh, uh

14:28.067 --> 14:29.733
- Word up
- * Why, indeed, yo

14:29.733 --> 14:31.633
* Why would we exclude
potentially great candidates *

14:31.633 --> 14:34.267
* For the most important job
there is? Yeah boy *

14:34.267 --> 14:36.500
* Go President
* Go President

14:38.633 --> 14:42.233
- The explicit formula
for the Fibonacci sequence.

14:42.233 --> 14:44.067
- Fibonacci?

14:44.067 --> 14:45.433
Guy is good.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.800
- This is my favorite equation
of all time.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.167
- * Samantha Power
Henry Kissinger *

14:50.167 --> 14:51.833
*And Madeleine Albright *

14:51.833 --> 14:53.067
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
Alexander Hamilton *

14:53.067 --> 14:54.300
* That's right *

14:54.300 --> 14:56.067
* None of them born
in the states *

14:56.067 --> 14:58.300
* None could be President
and that's an undeniable shame *

14:58.300 --> 15:00.167
- Yeah.
[all cheering]

15:00.167 --> 15:01.867
Nice.

15:01.867 --> 15:02.867
- You got this, Summer.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.367
- Yeah, just imagine that groove

15:04.367 --> 15:06.467
in your head at your debate,
and you're golden.

15:06.467 --> 15:07.633
- Thank you, Mr. Finn.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.333
I really learned
a lot from you.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.667
Wow, I never thought
I'd say that.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.300
- Yeah, that does feel weird.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.133
- Lawrence,
you sure Principal Mullins

15:16.133 --> 15:17.633
can't see or hear us?

15:17.633 --> 15:20.367
- Absolutely. This is
what she sees in her office.

15:21.767 --> 15:25.600
- You already know
that the Fibonacci sequence--

15:25.600 --> 15:28.533
[grunting]

15:33.633 --> 15:35.733
- If we fight
like space monsters,

15:35.733 --> 15:38.400
we'll die like space monsters.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.567
- What was that?

15:41.567 --> 15:45.200
- Looked like a scene
from Dr. Timewarp to me.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.767
- Yeah, but you
were Dr. Timewarp.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.067
- Well, whoever it was,

15:50.067 --> 15:52.067
I think we can all agree.
He nailed it.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.467
- Did Principal Mullins
see that?

15:54.467 --> 15:57.067
- If she was in her office,
she did.

15:57.067 --> 16:00.467
- [groans indistinctly]
Lawrence.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.467
- Something must have
gone wrong.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.500
Maybe someone's
private video footage

16:04.500 --> 16:06.067
got mixed into the tape loop.

16:06.067 --> 16:08.133
But since we don't know
who that Dr. Timewarp was,

16:08.133 --> 16:09.700
it will remain a mystery.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.200
- It was you.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.400
- That's one theory.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.433
[rock music]

16:18.600 --> 16:21.067
- Oh. Where'd you
just come from?

16:21.067 --> 16:25.233
- What? I was using
the bath--the facilities.

16:25.233 --> 16:28.567
- That's great news.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.067
She didn't see it.
- Oh, we're good.

16:34.067 --> 16:37.200
- Do you people understand
the concept of a tape loop?

16:37.200 --> 16:40.167
She'll see it when it comes on
again in a couple hours.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.600
Mr. Finn'll get fired,
the band will be over,

16:42.600 --> 16:44.600
and I'll be kicked
out of the AV Club.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.433
This is why I don't take risks.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.867
- Can't you just
fix it on your laptop?

16:50.867 --> 16:52.233
- You'd have to do that

16:52.233 --> 16:54.167
from the server
in Principal Mullins' office.

16:54.167 --> 16:57.667
- We can't depend on her going
to the bathroom again.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.567
- I've got it. She's the debate
coach, so in an hour,

17:00.567 --> 17:02.900
she'll be in the quad,
naming me the new captain

17:02.900 --> 17:04.067
of the debate team.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.133
- Yeah.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.467
- That's when we'll move.

17:06.467 --> 17:07.933
Ready? Go.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.800
- Wait, did you say an hour?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
- Yeah.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.067
Let's do it.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.067
- In an hour.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.233
- Right.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.367
[rock music]

17:23.867 --> 17:26.500
- Guys, I'm really
uncomfortable being here.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.933
This is a huge risk,

17:27.933 --> 17:30.833
and every risk
I've taken lately has backfired.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.233
- Relax. All you have
to do is be lookout.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.433
- Chill, dude.
We got this.

17:35.433 --> 17:37.500
- If we fight like
space monsters,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.767
we'll die like space monsters.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.167
Die like space monsters.
- Maybe we don't got this.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.300
- You made it worse.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.667
You're never going to be done

17:45.667 --> 17:47.600
before Principal Mullins
gets back from debate.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.933
- Hang on. I'm gonna
go buy us some more time.

17:52.233 --> 17:56.133
- Man, you're really taking it
to that teddy bear, buddy.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.267
[grunting]

17:59.733 --> 18:01.533
- The American presidency
is the most important job

18:01.533 --> 18:02.933
in our country, and therefore,
who can be President

18:02.933 --> 18:04.733
must be restricted
to natural-born citizens.

18:04.733 --> 18:07.567
Americans are capable of--
- Hey, have you gone yet?

18:07.567 --> 18:09.300
- No, I'm the last one,
but I'm up next.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.233
By the time I'm done, Clark's
going to be speed crying.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.767
- Great, good luck.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.300
One little thing, we need
more time to fix the loop,

18:16.300 --> 18:20.500
so it'd be great if you
could talk really slowly.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.767
- It's speed debate.
- I'm sorry.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.933
I know how important
this is to you,

18:24.933 --> 18:26.633
but the band needs this.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.133
- But the debate team
is so important to me,

18:28.133 --> 18:29.667
and I've worked so hard.
On the other hand,

18:29.667 --> 18:31.067
I love the band,
and it affects more people

18:31.067 --> 18:32.633
than just me.
- What are you doing?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.700
- I'm speed debating myself.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.533
- How is that going for you?
- I don't know.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.967
Both of me are making
excellent points.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.800
- There is no finer product

18:41.800 --> 18:43.500
than the one that was
made in America,

18:43.500 --> 18:44.767
and that's where I want
our presidents to be made,

18:44.767 --> 18:46.800
right here in the good old
US of A.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.267
[applause]

18:50.267 --> 18:51.500
- Very good, Clark.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.067
Not only did you speak quickly,

18:53.067 --> 18:55.767
but there was
very little spittle.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.700
Bravo.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.900
Uh, Summer, you're next.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.867
- America...

19:07.867 --> 19:10.200
[sighs]

19:10.200 --> 19:13.500
is...

19:13.500 --> 19:16.533
a...

19:16.533 --> 19:19.967
melting...

19:19.967 --> 19:21.667
pot.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.500
- All right, I'm out of ideas.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.900
I'm just gonna have to fix
this like my dad fixes the TV,

19:26.900 --> 19:29.767
bang the snot out of it
and yell, "Come on, work."

19:29.767 --> 19:30.867
- No.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.667
[sighs]
All you have to do

19:32.667 --> 19:34.667
is plug this into this,

19:34.667 --> 19:37.600
hit this button,
sync the feed,

19:37.600 --> 19:39.100
and hit Control+Enter.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.433
A baby could do it.

19:40.433 --> 19:42.333
- Well, a baby can't make toast,

19:42.333 --> 19:44.200
but I can.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.633
But you did it.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.767
- Huh. I did, didn't I?

19:49.633 --> 19:53.233
Mm?
- Hmm.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.633
- As...

19:54.633 --> 19:57.433
the world's...

19:57.433 --> 20:01.300
increasingly--

20:01.300 --> 20:03.533
- A part of me feels
bad for Summer,

20:03.533 --> 20:06.033
but a much larger part
of me feels great for me.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.000
- I was just punching the part
of you that was being a jerk.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.300
- Becomes...

20:15.300 --> 20:19.433
an international...

20:19.433 --> 20:21.500
community.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.000
* There's no reason our leaders
shouldn't be international *

20:23.000 --> 20:24.633
* Samantha Power
Henry Kissinger *

20:24.633 --> 20:26.067
* And Madeleine Albright
Arnold Schwarzenegger *

20:26.067 --> 20:27.867
* Alexander Hamilton
That's right *

20:27.867 --> 20:29.767
* Oh, did I mention Harry Styles
from One Direction *

20:29.767 --> 20:31.667
* None could be President
if we had an election *

20:31.667 --> 20:34.300
* and that's
an undeniable shame *

20:34.300 --> 20:35.833
* Boom

20:35.833 --> 20:39.000
[applause]

20:39.000 --> 20:41.400
- I think we've found
our new captain.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.567
- Yes.

20:43.567 --> 20:45.133
- That was a close call.

20:45.133 --> 20:48.167
I think we need a permanent
solution to those cameras.

20:48.167 --> 20:49.533
- Leave it to me.

20:49.533 --> 20:50.933
I got this.

20:52.967 --> 20:56.100
[electronic music]
[all giggling]

20:57.967 --> 20:59.300
- Hello, kids.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.667
*

21:01.667 --> 21:03.667
Oh, hello, girls.

21:03.667 --> 21:11.167
*

21:11.167 --> 21:13.933
[gasps]

21:17.167 --> 21:18.967
Oh.

21:20.267 --> 21:22.333
Oh, no.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.633
Oh--
Oh, back off.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.933
- All of the cameras need
to come down immediately.

21:28.933 --> 21:30.867
- You got it,
Principal Mullins.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.900
- Thank you.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.967
Oh, and um...

21:34.967 --> 21:37.233
do you know of any way
to get a video

21:37.233 --> 21:39.067
off of the Internet?

21:39.067 --> 21:42.167
I'll let you drive
the security golf cart.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.433
- I wish I could,
but that's impossible.

21:45.433 --> 21:47.067
- That is unfortunate.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.067
Okay.

21:51.633 --> 21:54.533
- You posted that video of
Principal Mullins, didn't you?

21:54.533 --> 21:55.667
- Maybe.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.467
I also maybe hid a camera

21:57.467 --> 21:58.833
inside the smoke detector,

21:58.833 --> 22:00.367
so we'll see her coming
even after

22:00.367 --> 22:02.067
I take the other cameras down.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.833
- Dude, that's pretty risky.

22:04.833 --> 22:08.067
- That's rock and roll.
