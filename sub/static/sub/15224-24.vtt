You're never
gonna believe

01:12.200 --> 01:13.367
who I had in
my cab last night!

01:13.400 --> 01:15.133
Hey, that's Herve Villechaize.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.501
Yeah, you know, the little guy
from <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:18.734
He left these pictures
in my cab last night.

01:18.767 --> 01:21.801
 What is this, eh...
 <i>Fantasy Island?</i>

01:21.834 --> 01:23.300
Well, actually, Latka,

01:23.334 --> 01:25.501
there really isn't
a Fantasy Island.

01:25.534 --> 01:27.801
Well, I wish there was
a place like that.

01:27.834 --> 01:31.167
Imagine someplace you could go
and live out all your fantasies.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.133
You seem to have a perspective
on world events

01:34.167 --> 01:36.767
that somehow eludes
the average man.

01:36.801 --> 01:38.868
You're no slouch yourself.

01:38.901 --> 01:41.501
Ooh, I have a fantasy,
all right.

01:48.467 --> 01:49.934
Halt.

01:49.968 --> 01:52.701
I have other dreams, too.

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:56.367 --> 01:58.634
the famous singer,
Bobby Wheeler!

01:58.667 --> 02:01.367
Hey, hey, Bobby!

02:01.400 --> 02:05.767
Sometimes... I think about
doing a little traveling.

02:07.701 --> 02:10.366
Wow! You guys are funny-lookin'.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.868
Mr. Villechaize, uh...

02:27.901 --> 02:31.467
I do something, uh...
I'd like you to see.

02:31.501 --> 02:33.133
( <i>grumbling</i> )

02:33.167 --> 02:34.834
You want to see it?
Yeah?

02:34.868 --> 02:36.868
Okay, here we go.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.667
( <i>imitating Villechaize</i> ):
Hiya, boss.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.167
How are you, boss?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.801
Here come da plane, boss.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.033
You like it?

02:44.067 --> 02:45.367
That's fine.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.701
That was you.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.334
Oh, that's very fine.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.234
Betcha he goes back
to Hollywood now, eh?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.400
Yeah...

03:01.434 --> 03:03.367
That must be some exciting life
he leads out there.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.934
I betcha he does things
that we can only dream about.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.267
Are you kidding?

03:07.300 --> 03:09.667
Don't you know
what Hollywood's like?

03:09.701 --> 03:11.767
I mean, right now,
that guy's out there

03:11.801 --> 03:16.200
surrounded by perverts, weirdos,
and human garbage.

03:16.234 --> 03:20.067
Makes me glad <i>I</i> didn't go
into show business.

03:21.734 --> 03:22.901
You know, it's weird.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.767
I think I have a handle
on what everyone in this garage

03:25.801 --> 03:27.067
would fantasize about,

03:27.100 --> 03:29.000
but the only one that throws me
is you, Alex.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.033
I mean, what would
you fantasize about?

03:31.067 --> 03:32.400
Yeah, Alex.

03:32.434 --> 03:33.667
Yeah, come on, Alex.

03:33.701 --> 03:34.667
What? What?

03:34.701 --> 03:36.367
As a matter of fact, I don't.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.968
Aw, sure.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.934
I don't.
ELAINE:
Oh, come on.

03:39.968 --> 03:40.934
No, really.

03:40.968 --> 03:43.501
I find it very difficult
to fantasize.

03:43.534 --> 03:44.834
You mean you never fantasize

03:44.868 --> 03:46.534
about the beautiful lady
in your cab?

03:46.567 --> 03:48.400
I mean,
everybody's got that one.

03:48.434 --> 03:49.567
Not me.

03:49.601 --> 03:51.234
Me, either.

03:52.701 --> 03:54.834
Aw, geez, Alex,
I can't even believe it.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.067
Well, listen,
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

03:57.100 --> 03:58.734
but that's how it is: I don't.

03:58.767 --> 04:02.067
I've tried to fantasize.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.400
I've tried to think up
some great situation,

04:04.434 --> 04:06.200
but somehow,
something always goes wrong.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.667
( <i>clears throat</i> )

04:23.701 --> 04:25.934
Hello.

04:25.968 --> 04:28.801
Hi there.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.033
Where can I take you?

04:30.067 --> 04:31.000
( <i>sighing</i> )

04:31.033 --> 04:32.234
I'm not sure where I want to go.

04:32.267 --> 04:35.000
Just drive anywhere.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.300
I think I know
where that is.

04:42.634 --> 04:45.667
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

04:45.701 --> 04:47.400
but has anyone
ever told you before

04:47.434 --> 04:50.200
that the back of your head
is quite attractive.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.234
Thank you.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.100
The front's nice too.

04:56.133 --> 04:58.534
That's something
to look forward to.

05:06.167 --> 05:07.267
You may not believe this,

05:07.300 --> 05:10.634
but this is my very first ride
in a taxi.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.267
Well, you know
what they say: first
time's the best time.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.968
( <i>laughs</i> )

05:15.000 --> 05:16.634
Well, actually,
I've always heard

05:16.667 --> 05:19.467
how rude and abrupt
cabbies were.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.467
You're not that way at all.

05:21.501 --> 05:24.267
Well, the evening
is still young.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.701
( <i>both laughing</i> )

05:27.367 --> 05:29.334
I'm really
enjoying myself.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.834
I should've done this
long ago.

05:31.868 --> 05:34.367
Me, too.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.367
Listen, I hope
you don't think

05:36.400 --> 05:38.534
this is too personal,
but, um...

05:38.567 --> 05:40.534
Well, even if it is...

05:40.567 --> 05:42.501
Can I ask you something?

05:42.534 --> 05:44.167
It's your cab.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.300
Why did you decide to
take this ride tonight?

05:47.334 --> 05:49.400
I was just feeling very alone.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.968
I'm a stranger in this big city,
all by myself,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.601
and something told me
I should just hail a cab.

05:54.634 --> 05:56.601
I didn't know why...

05:56.634 --> 05:59.100
till now.

06:01.167 --> 06:02.701
( <i>growls</i> )

06:09.667 --> 06:12.167
Feeling a little warm?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.634
Ever since
I got into this cab.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.701
I can turn the heat down.

06:16.734 --> 06:18.033
I don't think you could.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.067
( <i>clank</i> )

06:23.400 --> 06:26.501
So, tell me,
uh, cookie...

06:26.534 --> 06:28.434
what brings you
to New York?

06:28.467 --> 06:30.400
I'm here with my husband.

06:30.434 --> 06:31.934
Son of a...

06:33.701 --> 06:35.200
She's married?!

06:35.234 --> 06:37.634
Who's married?

06:37.667 --> 06:40.400
Huh? Oh, no one.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.968
I, uh... just drifted off
for a second.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.534
Oh, Alex, are you over there
trying to fantasize?

06:46.567 --> 06:48.834
Ah, no, I told you
I don't do that kind of stuff.

06:48.868 --> 06:52.834
Hey, Alex, if you're fantasizing
about a woman, make her single.

06:52.868 --> 06:54.334
( <i>laughing</i> )

06:54.367 --> 06:55.534
Well, it's not that easy,
you know.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.667
I mean, you just can't
imagine her single,

06:57.701 --> 06:59.100
and she comes out single,
can you?

06:59.133 --> 07:00.501
Yeah, you can.

07:00.534 --> 07:02.634
Oh, well, let me
give it another shot.

07:07.901 --> 07:10.367
Look, I can't do this if you're
all going to stare at me.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.000
Oh. Sorry.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.667
Okay, I mean business this time.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.801
So you're married, huh?

07:22.834 --> 07:24.467
No, not really.

07:24.501 --> 07:26.167
I just said that.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.367
Why?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.400
I was afraid
you'd come on to me.

07:31.434 --> 07:34.467
Well... why are you
admitting that now?

07:34.501 --> 07:38.167
I decided I'd take my chances.

07:40.434 --> 07:42.834
Back on course.

07:42.868 --> 07:46.133
Listen, I don't usually do this,
but, um...

07:46.167 --> 07:47.901
how would you like to...?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.534
Mm... never mind.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.300
Oh, say it, please.
Ask me.

07:51.334 --> 07:53.934
No, I think you'd find
me too presumptuous.

07:53.968 --> 07:55.767
No, no. Say it, please.

07:55.801 --> 07:57.701
Don't hold anything back.
I'm not.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.834
Would you like to
stop someplace and
have a cup of coffee?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.634
Oh, I'd love that.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.400
You would?
Mm.

08:08.434 --> 08:09.634
Well, where would you
like to go?

08:09.667 --> 08:11.434
Uh, we can go to my apartment,

08:11.467 --> 08:13.100
or if that would be
too uncomfortable for you,

08:13.133 --> 08:14.334
we can go out somewhere.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.834
Your apartment sounds fine.

08:15.868 --> 08:18.067
In fact,
your apartment sounds wonderful.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.167
Oh, great.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.868
This is turning
into a marvelous evening.

08:22.901 --> 08:25.434
I hope nothing comes along
to spoil it.

08:25.467 --> 08:26.934
Don't worry about it.

08:26.968 --> 08:28.901
I couldn't stop
now if I had to.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.467
( <i>tires screeching</i> )
Stop.

08:30.501 --> 08:31.467
I can't. I can't.

08:31.501 --> 08:32.900
Stop!

08:32.933 --> 08:34.967
( <i>crashing, glass shattering</i> )

08:37.067 --> 08:38.100
I can't even be trusted

08:38.133 --> 08:39.534
behind the wheel
of my own fantasy.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.333
You just got to relax.

08:41.366 --> 08:44.634
You know,
just free yourself, you know,

08:44.667 --> 08:46.200
and let yourself
go with the flow.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.200
Put yourself
in your own apartment.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.200
Oh, yeah, okay,
that's good,
that's good.

08:52.234 --> 08:53.534
Eh? All right?
All right?

08:53.567 --> 08:54.534
Yeah.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.501
Now, now... picture
yourself by a...

08:57.534 --> 08:59.434
by a roaring fire.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.701
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:01.734 --> 09:02.934
That's very good.
That's very good.

09:02.968 --> 09:04.767
Okay, now, now,

09:04.801 --> 09:06.300
now, just relax...

09:06.334 --> 09:09.267
and remember that
it's your fantasy,

09:09.300 --> 09:10.934
and in her eyes,

09:10.968 --> 09:13.367
you can't do anything wrong.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.868
Yeah. You're right.

09:14.901 --> 09:17.434
I just hope she's still alive.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.834
More very expensive brandy?

09:30.868 --> 09:32.534
Mmm...

09:37.200 --> 09:39.167
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:39.200 --> 09:42.467
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:42.501 --> 09:46.267
Am I glad that accident
was only a fender bender.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.100
You're not going to get
into any trouble, are you?

09:48.133 --> 09:51.300
No, I have a very
understanding dispatcher.

09:55.434 --> 09:57.834
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:57.868 --> 09:59.734
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:59.767 --> 10:01.467
Oh, this is wonderful.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.534
Is it really wonderful?

10:03.567 --> 10:06.000
Mm. Yes.

10:06.033 --> 10:07.701
Good.

10:12.701 --> 10:15.501
I've never done anything
like this before,

10:15.534 --> 10:19.467
and I've never met
anyone like you before.

10:19.501 --> 10:23.501
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,
oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.367
What's the matter?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.400
I just realized something.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.400
I don't even
know your name.

10:31.434 --> 10:33.100
Does it matter?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.968
How am I going
to tell my diary about you?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.634
Tawny.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.300
Tawny.

10:40.334 --> 10:42.901
My favorite name.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.400
I'm Alex.

10:44.434 --> 10:46.167
My favorite name.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.234
( <i>moaning passionately</i> )

10:50.267 --> 10:52.400
I'm afraid something
is going to go wrong.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.234
This is just too good.
Just too good.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.767
No, no.

10:55.801 --> 10:58.067
This... this is what
you've waited for.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.234
This is what you deserve.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.667
Yeah.
Trust me.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.334
I do.
Trust this.

11:02.367 --> 11:05.100
Oh... free, at last.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.200
( <i>shuddering moan</i> )

11:11.267 --> 11:13.267
Oh, man.

11:19.701 --> 11:22.167
I've always liked
the name Alex.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.334
When I was a little girl,

11:24.367 --> 11:27.501
I used to have an uncle
named Alexander.

11:27.534 --> 11:29.834
Oh, I thought
he was the greatest.

11:29.868 --> 11:31.968
I haven't seen him in years.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.100
We lost touch long ago.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.667
I lived in the Bronx,

11:35.701 --> 11:37.767
and his family would
come and see us

11:37.801 --> 11:38.934
every now and then.

11:38.968 --> 11:39.901
Yes, yes...

11:39.934 --> 11:41.834
Oh, he'd always
take me someplace--

11:41.868 --> 11:44.100
to the park or to
the playground,

11:44.133 --> 11:47.868
or the carnival,
if it was in season.

11:47.901 --> 11:50.667
But the thing that
I remember most...

11:50.701 --> 11:54.834
was that he'd always end
the day by buying me...

11:54.868 --> 11:57.701
...a double-dip Rocky
Road ice cream cone

11:57.734 --> 11:59.567
with a cherry on top.

11:59.601 --> 12:01.400
Right. How did...?

12:01.434 --> 12:03.534
Uncle Alex?!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.000
How's Aunt Rose?

12:15.033 --> 12:16.501
Fine.

12:16.534 --> 12:17.501
Cousin Harry?

12:17.534 --> 12:19.000
Great.

12:19.033 --> 12:20.334
Brother Bill?
Wonderful.

12:20.367 --> 12:21.334
Your daughter?

12:21.367 --> 12:22.367
Europe.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.901
I think we've
wasted enough time

12:28.934 --> 12:30.868
with this dumb talk
of fantasies.

12:30.901 --> 12:33.434
Fantasies are for losers.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.234
I suppose you don't
have any, Louie.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.534
Me? What would I need
a fantasy for?

12:37.567 --> 12:41.033
I'm usually the object
of other peoples' fantasies.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.734
Oh, sure.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.567
It's true.

12:44.601 --> 12:46.334
Come on, Louie,

12:46.367 --> 12:47.567
you mean you wouldn't
change anything

12:47.601 --> 12:49.000
if you had the chance to?

12:49.033 --> 12:51.734
Nothing.
My life is perfect.

12:54.601 --> 12:56.067
Well...

12:57.734 --> 12:59.200
...maybe there is...

12:59.234 --> 13:03.767
one or two things I might change
to make it even better.

13:12.367 --> 13:15.000
I wish we had some heat.
I'm freezing.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.100
Yeah.

13:16.133 --> 13:17.667
Well, you know Mr. De Palma

13:17.701 --> 13:20.000
would turn the heat up
if he could.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.734
That man, he's a saint.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.000
Bobby's right.

13:23.033 --> 13:27.400
( <i>coughing</i> )

13:27.434 --> 13:29.067
As owner of this cab company,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.534
Mr. De Palma has to cooperate

13:30.567 --> 13:34.067
with President Rizzo's
new energy program.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.601
He keeps that thermostat set

13:35.634 --> 13:37.000
right where it's supposed
to be...

13:37.033 --> 13:38.701
( <i>sneezes</i> )

13:38.734 --> 13:40.834
...28 degrees.

13:42.334 --> 13:46.534
You know, the Depression's
a lot harder on him.

13:46.567 --> 13:48.167
Imagine how tough it would be

13:48.200 --> 13:51.501
being the only rich man
left in the country.

13:51.534 --> 13:54.100
Hmm.
Yeah.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.367
TONY:
Here he comes now.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.467
ALEX:
Huh? Huh?

13:56.501 --> 13:57.734
Here he comes.

14:06.334 --> 14:08.501
On your way home, sir?

14:08.534 --> 14:11.100
Yeah. I'm bushed.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.601
How are you guys doing?

14:13.634 --> 14:15.667
ALEX:
Awful.

14:15.701 --> 14:19.033
Yeah. This Depression
is a darn shame, isn't it?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.467
( <i>coughing</i> )

14:21.501 --> 14:23.601
That's a mighty nasty cough
you got there, Rieger.

14:23.634 --> 14:25.133
Oh, it's nothing, sir.
Just a touch

14:25.167 --> 14:26.868
of double pneumonia.
It's going around.

14:26.901 --> 14:30.667
Nevertheless, I think
you better see my doctor.

14:30.701 --> 14:32.667
Have him take a look at you.

14:32.701 --> 14:34.834
Oh... that's much
too kind of you, sir.

14:34.868 --> 14:37.000
Now, now, now,
never mind, never mind.

14:37.033 --> 14:39.834
That could be bronchitis
on top of pneumonia.

14:39.868 --> 14:41.701
That's what Wheeler's got,

14:41.734 --> 14:43.934
and he's dying,
aren't you, Wheeler?

14:43.968 --> 14:45.501
Yes, sir.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.367
That's the spirit.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.033
You almost done in there?

14:55.067 --> 14:56.868
Not quite.

14:56.901 --> 14:58.801
All right, well,
keep at it.

15:07.667 --> 15:09.567
LOUIE:
 <i>I'm home.</i>

15:11.400 --> 15:12.667
Louie!

15:18.200 --> 15:19.701
Louie, darling.

15:24.701 --> 15:27.000
I've missed you so much.

15:27.033 --> 15:29.234
Why are you dressed
like that?

15:29.267 --> 15:31.834
Because it's so warm
in here.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.501
You keep it at 85.

15:33.534 --> 15:34.834
Mm-hmm.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.133
( <i>chuckles</i> )

15:36.167 --> 15:39.234
You know, Louie, all day
long, I've been praying

15:39.267 --> 15:42.200
that you'll reconsider
firing you-know-who.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.234
Not a chance.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.167
Not a chance.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.200
I think I've been fair.

15:49.234 --> 15:52.367
When somebody doesn't pull
their weight...

15:52.400 --> 15:54.133
they're gone.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.067
But she loves you so much.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.033
I know.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.767
Send her in.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.834
He wants to see you, Lassie.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.567
Come on in and sit down.

16:18.601 --> 16:21.167
( <i>whimpering</i> )

16:24.667 --> 16:26.667
Sit down.

16:26.701 --> 16:29.667
Bye, Lassie. Bye.

16:29.701 --> 16:33.167
Nardo, you're taking some
of the surprise out of this.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.200
Now, get out of here.

16:38.367 --> 16:40.701
It's just you and me, girl.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.834
Lassie...

16:44.868 --> 16:47.133
I know you've...

16:47.167 --> 16:51.667
you've been with us
a long time.

16:51.701 --> 16:53.000
( <i>heavy sigh</i> )

16:53.033 --> 16:55.834
I don't know... I just have
to do something with you.

16:55.868 --> 16:59.300
I mean, you're getting away
with murder.

16:59.334 --> 17:00.634
You know?

17:00.667 --> 17:02.801
I've got to lay down
the laws.

17:02.834 --> 17:06.701
Benji... she's going
through the roof.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.534
Snoopy--
through the roof.

17:09.567 --> 17:10.968
I mean, what can you do?

17:15.467 --> 17:19.032
That's just not enough
anymore, girl.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.800
I mean, they're out there
making millions.

17:22.834 --> 17:26.032
Do you know what Benji made
last year?

17:26.067 --> 17:27.601
( <i>barks three times</i> )

17:27.634 --> 17:30.501
Uh-huh. Well, how much
did you make last year?

17:30.534 --> 17:32.534
( <i>barks once</i> )

17:34.000 --> 17:37.033
Well, that just doesn't
cut it, Lassie.

17:38.868 --> 17:40.734
Take a walk.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.901
( <i>whining</i> )

17:46.200 --> 17:49.234
( <i>whimpering</i> )

17:49.267 --> 17:52.033
All right, but just one.

18:01.033 --> 18:02.701
Okay, now beat it.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.334
Aw...

18:11.367 --> 18:13.033
It was so sad
seeing her go.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.234
Yeah, well...

18:16.501 --> 18:17.467
( <i>sighs</i> )

18:17.501 --> 18:18.801
Maybe this will
make you feel better.

18:18.834 --> 18:22.300
It's a little something
I picked up on the way home.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.167
Oh, it's beautiful.

18:35.567 --> 18:37.467
Oh, well.

18:37.501 --> 18:39.701
A man can dream, can't he?

18:43.701 --> 18:45.334
Hey, uh, come on, Elaine.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.067
You're trying to get
everybody else

18:47.100 --> 18:48.968
to talk about
their fantasies.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.467
Why don't you tell us
one of yours?

18:50.501 --> 18:51.767
Yeah!

18:51.801 --> 18:53.100
Forget it!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.567
I mean, if nobody
else is going to talk
about it, why should I?

18:55.601 --> 18:58.667
Yeah, you're right.

18:58.701 --> 18:59.801
No point.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.901
Let's forget it.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.834
But if I were to tell you
my fantasy...

19:06.868 --> 19:09.968
it would knock you out.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.767
Yeah?
Oh, really?

19:11.801 --> 19:13.467
BOBBY:
Come on, come on,
come on, what is it?

19:16.334 --> 19:18.133
( <i>groans</i> )

19:18.167 --> 19:20.968
Anybody got any ideas
about what we can do?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.334
Let's play
another hand of poker.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.167
We always play cards.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.300
We play cards every day.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.067
That's all we do is play cards.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.634
Play cards.
