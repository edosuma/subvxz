WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.570
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:02.603 --> 00:05.005
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

00:05.039 --> 00:07.241
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

00:07.275 --> 00:10.611
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.986
Four score
and seven years ago...

03:35.249 --> 03:36.750
What are you doing?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.255
Working on sound-wave data.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.892
I mean what are you watching?

03:44.925 --> 03:48.462
That is Arthur Miller
and Marilyn Monroe

03:48.496 --> 03:50.664
having sex.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.467
Jesus.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.573
It's the celebrity sex tape
to end all celebrity sex tapes.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.279
Why do male techs
always feel the need

04:05.313 --> 04:07.114
to caricature themselves?

04:07.147 --> 04:09.116
create a new technology

04:09.149 --> 04:11.385
that reinvents the nature
of human existence.

04:11.419 --> 04:14.555
use it for porn.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.190
To thine own self be true.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.461
We have two fucking rules, guys.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.830
we don't look forwards,
we only look back.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.998
we don't invade privacy.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.568
They're having sex, Katie.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.070
And that would be
the invasion of privacy.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.739
Hardly a person exists
that didn't

04:31.772 --> 04:34.675
come into being because
two other people had sex.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.677
As far as human behavior goes,

04:36.710 --> 04:38.846
that puts it on a par
with breathing.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.315
Your hang-ups
are not my hang-ups.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.816
Got it, Stewart.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.318
So you'd be cool
if we brought everyone in

04:44.352 --> 04:45.853
to watch you having sex.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.956
Not sure the system
is powerful enough

04:48.989 --> 04:50.991
to predict
that far back in time.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.263
Turn it off.
Scratch some other geek itch.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.831
Do the grassy knoll.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.867
Been there, done that.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.870
It was Oswald.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.373
Whatever.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.508
Find something else.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.910
And don't break
the fucking rules.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.555
Don't break the rules?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.357
Coming from her?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.470
Senator.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.473
Forest.
Good to see you.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.476
We've got an hour and a half.
I have a lunch back in town.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.745
And how are tricks
in quantum computing?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.246
-Kenton.
-Joe.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.782
Thriving.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.998
My senate subcommittee
on tech oversight

07:11.031 --> 07:12.533
has scheduled its hearing.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.769
Gonna call you in, Forest.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.137
Why?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.639
Your company didn't just

07:18.672 --> 07:21.141
take the lead
in the quantum computer race.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.477
You demolished your competitors.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.978
They have nothing.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.380
You have everything.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.417
And I have questions.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.319
Is that your leverage?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.788
Questions.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.557
You don't think that's leverage?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.831
What are you working on
in the section of your company

07:43.864 --> 07:45.833
known as Devs?

07:45.866 --> 07:49.336
Devs means development.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.339
Every tech company
has a development division.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.841
Yes.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.876
But what, specifically,
are you developing?

07:58.712 --> 08:01.048
Uh, we're exploring
the potential

08:01.081 --> 08:03.651
of our quantum computer system.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.119
That's a little vague.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.288
Vague sounds like
you don't like attention.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.790
Why is that?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.993
It distracts us from our work.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.896
The distractions are trivial
in comparison to your work?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.198
Yes.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.300
Isn't that the perfect argument
as to why your company

08:20.333 --> 08:21.735
needs government oversight?

08:21.769 --> 08:25.005
But you don't want oversight,
Senator.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.540
You want control.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.410
You want my systems for the NSA.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.413
We want your systems

08:33.446 --> 08:35.849
for America.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.951
Unless you think
America's trivial, too.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.824
Do you see how this works?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.559
Do you know how easily
I would crucify you

08:45.593 --> 08:47.094
in a public hearing?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.334
People have become scared
of the tech companies, Forest.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.069
Really scared.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.872
AI is gonna create
60% unemployment.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.541
Instagram makes people feel
like shit about their lives.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.543
Twitter makes them feel reviled.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.879
Facebook destroyed democracy.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.881
They use you.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.850
They need you.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.551
But they don't like you anymore.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.289
Now, there are
other lines of questioning.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.627
Your company
is an American success story,

09:19.660 --> 09:23.463
showing, again, how we
lead the world in tech.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.900
While we understand and respect
the competitive nature

09:26.934 --> 09:28.268
of your industry,

09:28.301 --> 09:31.038
and the requirement
for trade secrets,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.373
could you shed a little light
on what you're working on

09:33.406 --> 09:34.908
in Devs?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.417
Um...

09:44.451 --> 09:46.654
we're using our quantum system

09:46.687 --> 09:50.123
to develop
a prediction algorithm.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.293
Predict what--
stock markets, market trends?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.895
Sure.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.329
The weather?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.265
And that kind of thing.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.600
So you're working on
a prediction algorithm

10:00.634 --> 10:02.102
for the weather.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.405
There's no reason
why it should be hard

10:05.438 --> 10:06.940
for us to work together.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.411
So...

10:11.444 --> 10:12.946
is it gonna rain tomorrow?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.290
Doesn't look like it.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.045
Okay, you start
with the question

10:45.078 --> 10:48.048
is N the product of P times Q?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.717
Then imagine two sine waves,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.919
where one is length P,
and one Q.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.397
Just figure out the phase
of each wave at any given point

11:04.431 --> 11:05.999
on the number line.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.402
So, if we look at point N,
the phase of P and Q

11:09.436 --> 11:12.840
must be zero
if they're factors of N.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.407
I get it. Or else
there would be a remainder...

11:14.441 --> 11:15.943
Uh, hang on, guys.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.379
Hi, Lily.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.914
Sorry I'm late.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.987
Um, none of us
thought you were coming.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.356
Or we would have waited.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.858
It's okay.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.894
It's better for me to be here.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.362
It's hard at home.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.964
Right.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.100
Of course.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.536
We were just going over Shor.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.405
Um...

11:45.438 --> 11:47.340
circling back, um...

11:47.374 --> 11:49.576
Shor is testing
whether the phase of P

11:49.609 --> 11:53.013
equals the phase of Q
equals zero,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.948
and that's as far as we got.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.787
Lily?
Lily.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.757
Sorry.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.796
Did you ask me something?

12:11.264 --> 12:12.800
Guys, will you give us a minute?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.835
-Sure.
-Thanks.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.917
Hey.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.621
Hey.
I'm sorry.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.156
No, don't say that.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.592
Come on.
Talk to me, Lils.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.332
I do really need
to talk to someone.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.867
I'm right here.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.972
Can I talk to you?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.473
Of course.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.008
I mean safely?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.445
Safely?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.347
I can trust you?

13:00.380 --> 13:03.483
Lily, will you please
stop doing that to your hands.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.952
I can trust you.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.486
Yes, you can.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.857
Totally.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.728
Can we talk outside?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.994
So...

13:47.027 --> 13:50.530
everyone believes
Sergei committed suicide,

13:50.563 --> 13:54.467
but... I think
it might not be true.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.971
What do you mean?
What isn't true?

13:58.005 --> 14:01.942
I saw the film of what happened.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.081
But I think it was fake.
A cover story.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.151
I'm sorry.
I'm...

14:11.184 --> 14:14.154
I just need to understand
exactly what you mean.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.724
Are you saying that Sergei
might still be alive?

14:17.757 --> 14:19.927
I don't know.
Maybe that.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.694
Maybe something else.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.063
But they found a body, Lils.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.397
It was burned to shit.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.066
Who knows if it was him?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.068
Could be anyone.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.703
Sorry to be graphic, okay?

14:30.737 --> 14:33.840
But I think they can still
identify burned bodies.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.043
DNA, dental, that kind of thing.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.078
But who's doing
the identifying?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.082
CIA?

14:43.616 --> 14:46.586
No, not the CIA.
The police.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.088
The coroner.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.890
And what if they're
a part of it?

14:50.924 --> 14:52.725
Part of what?

14:53.961 --> 14:56.729
I spoke to someone yesterday.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.000
Whatever's going on, it-it...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.636
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Jen.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.638
What are you guys doing?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.108
Lils and I were just talking.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.442
Okay.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.444
You mind Jen joining us?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.746
No.
She's cool.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.415
Um, so Lils

15:15.448 --> 15:17.750
was talking about Sergei.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.252
And she has some thoughts.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.388
More than thoughts.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.390
Right.
That there might be

15:23.423 --> 15:25.925
something weird
about what happened.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.264
So, what were you gonna say
about who you spoke to?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.300
I can't tell you too much.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.636
But it's international, okay?

15:38.938 --> 15:42.142
It involves
international forces.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
It's fucked up.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.258
Okay.
I'm not making any judgment

15:58.291 --> 15:59.759
about anything you're saying.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.261
I'm not saying
any of it's wrong.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.863
It's not fucking wrong.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.199
Sure.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.601
But even if

16:08.635 --> 16:10.870
everything you're worried about

16:10.903 --> 16:13.140
is true...

16:13.173 --> 16:15.975
you're still someone who has
suffered a terrible shock.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.678
A terrible loss.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.981
And I think you need
to talk to someone

16:22.015 --> 16:23.516
who can help you with that.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.558
Yeah.
I do.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.228
Good.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
I'll speak to Kenton.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.700
The head of security?

16:40.733 --> 16:43.570
I think that's
a good idea, Lils.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.206
This is the kind of thing
you should be telling Kenton.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.974
It's above our pay grade, right?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.509
Yeah.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.346
He'll know what to do.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.383
Jen, mind if I talk to you
a moment?

16:57.584 --> 16:58.851
What the fuck are you doing?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.153
Can't you see she's not well?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.821
Of course I can see.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.191
Then what are you doing
going along with this shit?

17:04.224 --> 17:05.925
International forces?

17:05.958 --> 17:09.396
Okay, look, I didn't
want to get into this.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.764
But me and Lils go back.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.366
This isn't the first time, okay?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.735
She's had...

17:15.768 --> 17:17.270
episodes.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.640
-Stuff like this before.
-Stuff like what?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.043
Schizophrenia.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.380
Oh, shit.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.583
If we make the wrong move now,
anything could happen.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.585
She could flip.
She could run.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.222
She could vanish.
And then no one can help her.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.425
So what we do
is get her into the system

17:38.458 --> 17:40.427
without her realizing.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.795
We make it look like
we're doing what she wants.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.475
Okay, I get it.
I'll make the call.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.629
I get a good suit.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.634
Pay's better than I'm used to.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.003
And I don't have to go
two weeks without a shower.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.941
But the truth is...

18:31.378 --> 18:34.481
...all day, every day,

18:34.514 --> 18:37.517
I am bored
out of my fucking mind.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.123
What I wouldn't give
for some little jerk

18:44.157 --> 18:47.160
to pull a gun or a knife
and try and take her out.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.301
But... never happens.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.309
Seriously.
Don't you miss it?

19:05.212 --> 19:07.113
The uniform?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.648
Fucking adrenaline.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
Honestly, can't say I do.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.729
Excuse me.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.533
Kenton.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.570
Lily Chan?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.408
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.280
Her sup...
What exactly did she say?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.521
Be there in ten minutes.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.056
Shit.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.859
Can you hold the fort?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.762
Think I'll just about manage.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.527
So I got a message
from your supervisor

20:27.560 --> 20:29.896
that you wanted
to talk to me personally.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.132
Do you want to talk in private?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.868
No.
I want her to stay.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.870
Okay.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.072
So...

20:40.106 --> 20:42.575
I'm here.
Go ahead.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.144
It's about Sergei.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.214
There's... stuff.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.683
Stuff about him you don't know.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.654
Like what?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.689
Like he wasn't
what he said he was.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.627
He was working for someone.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.663
And I met a man yesterday
who knew all about it.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.299
Who was that?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.435
A spy.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.169
An operative.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.071
An operative.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.673
Yes.
Russian.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.509
And I don't think
Sergei committed suicide.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.479
I think he was murdered.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.353
Murdered by who?

21:27.887 --> 21:30.557
I think it was them.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.793
The operatives.
The Russians.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.629
Yes.
They were trying to trick me.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.532
They were trying
to recruit me, okay?

21:39.566 --> 21:41.534
But I saw through it.

21:41.568 --> 21:45.137
Because I've been through
all this before.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.839
In Brooklyn.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.112
In-in Brooklyn?

21:53.145 --> 21:56.449
A few years ago
I was working with a start-up.

21:56.483 --> 22:00.286
I was on the encryption team
and I started to see

22:00.319 --> 22:02.655
a whole bunch of things
that made no sense.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.991
Like, I'd look at strings
that should have been RNGs,

22:05.024 --> 22:07.560
but they obviously
weren't RNGs.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.295
There were Fibonacci
sequences everywhere,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
I mean, fucking everywhere.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.966
Th-That's...
W-What's, uh...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.536
She was seeing a pattern in what
should have been random numbers.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.538
And you get the same pattern
in nature.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.507
Like numbers of petals
on a flower.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.008
Number of segments
in a shell.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.143
And at that time,
I had a boyfriend

22:24.176 --> 22:27.514
who had a dragon flower tattoo
over his arm and back.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.981
And I counted the petals, okay?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.550
And it was five and eight.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.184
And the dragon had 21 scales.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.720
And that's
the same fucking thing.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.323
Same as what?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.925
Same as Sergei.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.331
I'm not following.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.034
Are you telling me
this is all a coincidence?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.036
-Lily...
-N-No.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.506
Just answer the question.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.542
Can this be a coincidence?

22:58.778 --> 23:01.948
Jen, you remember
what happened in Brooklyn.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.516
Yes.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.184
And now Sergei.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.719
Right?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.255
Right.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.057
So?

23:12.892 --> 23:16.362
I mean, do not
fucking do this, Jen.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.864
You were there back then.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.032
Lily, please.
Yes, I was there.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.034
Then don't look at me
like you think I'm crazy.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.636
I'm telling you,

23:23.670 --> 23:26.706
I met the fucking
Russian operative yesterday,

23:26.739 --> 23:28.941
right by Golden Gate Bridge.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.043
In-in broad daylight.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.779
Jesus fucking Christ, Jen,

23:32.812 --> 23:34.914
I swear to God, if you're not
gonna believe me...

23:34.947 --> 23:36.649
I didn't say
I didn't believe you.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.184
Fuck!

23:44.423 --> 23:45.825
I need air.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.393
Nobody expects
technological progress

24:54.426 --> 24:56.729
to be reversed.
It never is.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.231
I think the equivalent
is the Industrial Revolution,

24:59.265 --> 25:01.200
which makes my job
to stop the Luddites

25:01.233 --> 25:03.169
from smashing the looms.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.204
Good to know, Senator.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.540
So you'd continue
to protect my tech company

25:07.574 --> 25:10.076
even if I stopped raising money
for your campaign?

25:10.109 --> 25:11.878
Don't be cute.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.280
Likewise.
My campus is not...

25:19.085 --> 25:21.220
You're telling me

25:21.253 --> 25:23.656
she's actually
been hospitalized before.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.658
For, like, a month. Maybe more.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.259
I don't know much.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.895
Her family took care of it.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.563
-But...
-Hold on.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.865
Sir.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.267
Lily Chan is on the ledge
outside your office.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.402
What?

25:36.435 --> 25:38.537
Get her down safely.
Right fucking now.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.072
Fuck.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.609
Okay, Lily.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.645
Mind telling me
what we're doing out here?

26:20.947 --> 26:23.783
Just... needed fresh air.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.253
Air's not fresh enough
on the ground?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.256
Needed to get out.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.291
Well, we're out.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.263
I guess the air
is fresh up here.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.299
So... let's not make
any sudden movements

26:40.332 --> 26:41.834
in the ground direction.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.714
Lily, I got to tell you
something.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.150
Everything you told me

26:58.184 --> 27:01.487
about the Russian operatives
and Sergei...

27:03.189 --> 27:06.325
You probably feel that
people won't believe you.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.694
Maybe they'll think
you're crazy.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.162
But actually, I do believe you.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.365
I think it all may be true.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.038
Man, it's a crazy world.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.842
The shit that happens is weirder

27:22.875 --> 27:25.878
than anyone ever expects,
ever imagines.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.581
True, right?

27:32.852 --> 27:36.022
Well, that's-that's what
people like you and me know.

27:36.055 --> 27:39.058
That nothing is stranger
than reality.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.429
Nothing.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.833
Yeah.

27:49.068 --> 27:52.071
In the meantime,
you see those people down there?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.709
They're worried
you're gonna jump.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.378
I'm not, because I think
we understand each other.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.882
But... they have their hearts
in their mouths.

28:02.915 --> 28:03.950
They're frightened.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.487
I think the right thing to do
is for us to

28:08.520 --> 28:10.857
just walk back down this ledge,

28:10.890 --> 28:13.325
crawl back onto that walkway,

28:13.359 --> 28:16.362
and you tell me
whatever else it is

28:16.395 --> 28:17.897
you need me to know.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.034
Okay?

28:25.905 --> 28:27.406
Okay.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.242
Come on.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.874
Quite the day.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.275
Yeah.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.811
I'll be in touch.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.988
You lucky son of a bitch.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.756
It's all go in tech.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.428
Sir.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.901
That was very close, Kenton.
It nearly fucked the universe.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.069
There's an upside, sir.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.105
We have an ace card
with Lily Chan.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.043
What ace card?

30:44.076 --> 30:45.544
She's schizophrenic.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.646
Or something.
According to her pal,

30:47.679 --> 30:49.748
she's had at least
two previous episodes,

30:49.781 --> 30:51.918
one of which required
hospitalization.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.654
-And we didn't know?
-Well, she hid it.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.756
Undeclared on her medical forms,

30:57.789 --> 30:59.058
in case she couldn't
get the job.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.927
But it's cool.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.895
We can play that card any time.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.831
Anything she says about us
is dismissible.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.535
Anything that happens to her
is explainable.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.972
But nothing is going to happen
to her, Kenton.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.375
I know.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.112
So where is she now?

31:20.146 --> 31:21.613
Her buddy took her home.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.382
Seems to know how to handle her.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.685
And tomorrow, we set her up
with a shrink. One of ours.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.256
That keeps her both at arm's
length and under observation.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.893
It's all okay, sir.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.964
We're still on your tram lines.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.034
Holy motherfucking shit.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.370
That was Oscar-level, Lils.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.072
Like, Jesus.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.739
The crying?

31:47.773 --> 31:49.408
Fucking incredible.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.144
I didn't have to reach far
to find that.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.912
But still.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.082
And that Fibonacci stuff?

31:56.115 --> 31:57.683
The tattoo?

31:59.351 --> 32:02.121
You told them
I had a psychiatric history?

32:02.154 --> 32:04.656
Yep, and they bought it.
100%.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.592
I mean, I fucking bought it.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.759
Do you think they can check?

32:07.793 --> 32:09.761
I think they can try,

32:09.795 --> 32:12.098
but where do they look?

32:12.131 --> 32:15.134
You could have been in Canada
or Mexico for all they know.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.107
Here.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.442
It's got exactly
what you wanted.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.814
Thank you so much.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.816
No.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.352
He was my friend, too.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.378
So this is
your new thing, then--

33:32.411 --> 33:34.246
appearing outside windows?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.282
Kind of is.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.436
Jamie...

33:57.469 --> 33:59.605
I do need your help again.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.141
Sure.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.879
Sergei was missing 24 hours

34:07.913 --> 34:09.948
after leaving Amaya.

34:09.981 --> 34:13.519
In that time,
he didn't use his phone.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.354
He didn't use a credit card.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.924
The only information anyone has
is the film of him

34:18.957 --> 34:21.927
walking back into Amaya

34:21.960 --> 34:23.962
and setting himself on fire.

34:30.802 --> 34:34.573
I have all the security footage
from that night right here.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.609
But I can't watch it alone.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.324
You want us to watch
the man you left me for

34:52.358 --> 34:54.326
burn himself to death...

34:54.360 --> 34:55.861
together?

34:57.796 --> 35:00.432
That's transcendently weird,
Lily.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.670
I know.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.315
Geez.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.108
Okay.
Wi-Fi's ultra-dead.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.311
We're unseeable.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.172
Jesus Christ.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.185
Are you sure about this?

36:27.219 --> 36:29.855
I can watch it alone.
You don't have to see it again.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.191
I'm okay, Jamie.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.028
Just play it.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.209
Fuck.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.808
Okay.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.211
There's nothing there.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.146
No, w-wait a second.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.648
What?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.116
I'm not sure.
Just let me...

37:44.596 --> 37:46.097
Whoa.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.200
What is it?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.342
Look.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.876
Right here.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.546
Right here.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.549
The flames.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.188
They're the same.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.162
Every frame.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.038
The same flame.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.208
Do you see it?

38:30.241 --> 38:31.743
I see it.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.514
It's VFX.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.485
100%, they're not real.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.021
You said there was a body,
right?

38:43.054 --> 38:44.523
Yes.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.125
But a physical body.
You actually saw it.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.660
I saw it.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.130
The police were there.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.499
Forensics.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.301
If you saw a physical body

38:56.334 --> 38:58.303
and it's a digital fire effect,

38:58.336 --> 39:00.906
that allows for a possibility.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.577
The body is real.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.580
The suicide is fake.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.616
They murdered him.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.007

42:57.976 --> 43:00.612
Cause precedes effect.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.814
Effect leads to cause.

43:02.848 --> 43:06.685
The future is fixed
in exactly the same way
as the past.

43:13.859 --> 43:16.094
I had no idea
what I would find

43:16.127 --> 43:17.929
when I went searching
for my father.

43:17.963 --> 43:20.699
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

43:20.799 --> 43:23.468
He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.

43:31.309 --> 43:33.611
Pulling hair is wrong, mate.

43:33.645 --> 43:36.882
I mean, all violence is wrong,
but at least punching's a sport.

43:36.982 --> 43:38.483
-Is it?
-Yes, boxing.

43:38.516 --> 43:40.618
Boxing's in the Olympics.
Hair pulling isn't.

43:41.820 --> 43:44.856
-It would be funny if it was.
-It really would be.

43:52.397 --> 43:54.465
Do I just knock, or what?
What do you think?

43:56.134 --> 43:58.136
I feel like
they're not ever gonna...

44:00.071 --> 44:02.073
Why are you wearing
your sunglasses inside?

44:02.173 --> 44:04.710
Bro, you know I gotta drip, bro.
We're goin' to the studio
right now.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.378
Snack Time. I didn't--

44:07.412 --> 44:09.848
Okay. You're welcome.

44:11.182 --> 44:13.351
I feel like that did nothing
for my career.

44:29.735 --> 44:30.736
Hi.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.087
Check!

44:50.588 --> 44:51.589
Check.
