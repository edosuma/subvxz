01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.565
I was sure of that.

01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:46.570
What, you think everything
is already planned?

01:16:46.637 --> 01:16:49.071
I think the universe
influences things

01:16:49.073 --> 01:16:50.974
and brings people together.

01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:52.743
Like you and me?

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:54.344
Exactly.

01:16:57.449 --> 01:17:00.584
So, if I leave now,
what would you do?

01:17:02.019 --> 01:17:04.721
I'd probably kick everyone
out so I could walk you home.

01:17:04.723 --> 01:17:06.289
You wouldn't dare.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:17.367
Look, I'm very sorry, but
I'm gonna have to close now,

01:17:17.369 --> 01:17:20.206
so thank you all for coming.

01:17:20.439 --> 01:17:24.409
My apologies and please feel
free to come back tomorrow.

01:17:24.477 --> 01:17:26.045
Thank you very much.

01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:38.289
Just part of the way, okay?

01:17:38.291 --> 01:17:40.459
Yeah, just part of the way.
