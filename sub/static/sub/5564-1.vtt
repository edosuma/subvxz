03:51.381 --> 03:53.625

03:53.656 --> 03:56.281
- Good day?
- Yeah, two pages.

Is that good?

03:57.692 --> 03:58.909
Hmm.

03:59.998 --> 04:03.618
- How 'bout you?
- Ah, we got two perch.

04:04.771 --> 04:08.519
- Is that good?
- Ah, yesterday we had 24, so...

04:11.850 --> 04:15.501
Well, you ain't writing
and the fish ain't biting.

04:17.231 --> 04:19.505
- Ah, no.
- Come on.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.798
Good for ya.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.513
See ya.

05:31.193 --> 05:32.442
Hmm.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.884
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.480
I was just thinking about you.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.985
You coming home soon?

05:47.017 --> 05:50.508
Uh, no, I'm just... I'm not finished yet.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.918
Oh.

05:52.654 --> 05:54.000
Okay.

05:54.737 --> 05:56.562
How is it going?

05:56.594 --> 05:58.484
Well, I'm not getting anywhere.

06:01.014 --> 06:03.769
Tomas, don't lose faith.
You have it in you, you know that.

06:03.801 --> 06:05.915
Will you stop saying that?

06:05.948 --> 06:07.805
It's, it's not that simple.

06:11.585 --> 06:16.422
And listen, I was, I was thinking
about what we discussed yesterday.

06:16.454 --> 06:19.081
Do we have to talk about it on the phone?

06:21.708 --> 06:23.212
I might just as well tell you now.

06:23.245 --> 06:24.462
I'm, uh...

06:25.584 --> 06:27.601
I'm not ready for all that.

06:43.041 --> 06:44.899
Keep goin', keep goin'.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.839

You're lucky. Come here.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.279
You're fine.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.617
You scared me.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.788
Here. Put this on.

10:04.074 --> 10:05.931
Is that where you live?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.882
Come on, bud, come on.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.311
You cold?

10:41.711 --> 10:43.153
What's your name?

10:47.349 --> 10:49.271
Is your mom home?

10:50.488 --> 10:52.346
Not talkin', huh?

10:57.696 --> 10:59.200
Alright.

11:38.857 --> 11:40.362
- Sara?
- Tomas.

11:40.393 --> 11:42.027
- Yeah?
- Maybe you were right...

11:42.059 --> 11:43.534
Uh, I can't really talk right now.

11:43.565 --> 11:45.903
- Something happened.
- Uh, are you okay?

11:46.993 --> 11:48.531
- Every thing's fine.
- Okay.

11:48.562 --> 11:51.541
Um... listen...

11:51.573 --> 11:53.879
I know that lately I've been edgy.

11:53.911 --> 11:56.185
And you've been so kind.

11:56.218 --> 11:58.107
I just want you to know that...

11:58.140 --> 12:00.638
that everything's gonna be different.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.464
Okay. Okay.

12:02.496 --> 12:05.859
- Uh, I'll wait to eat with you.
- Yeah. I'll be home soon.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.269
Okay, bye.

12:14.252 --> 12:17.359
Alright, Christopher.

12:18.512 --> 12:20.689
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

12:23.029 --> 12:24.406
Did you make those snowmen?

12:26.328 --> 12:28.186
You do it alone or with a friend?

12:29.979 --> 12:31.837
That one's kind of pudgy.

12:46.251 --> 12:48.430
Alright, let's go.

12:52.242 --> 12:53.491
Come on.

13:01.627 --> 13:03.485
Wanna ring the bell?

13:23.697 --> 13:28.598
Hi, uh, we almost had
a little accident down at the road.

13:28.630 --> 13:30.744
Uh, everything's alright, but...

13:32.410 --> 13:35.356
I think Christopher got a little scared.

13:36.574 --> 13:38.431
Where's Nicholas?

13:40.771 --> 13:41.921
Where's Nicholas?

14:05.690 --> 14:06.972
Oh!

14:53.931 --> 14:55.789
Would you want us to come in with you?

15:05.367 --> 15:07.257
I'm so sorry, Mr. Eldan.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.395
Don't blame yourself.

15:16.737 --> 15:19.909
I'll contact you if we need
any other additional information.

15:25.963 --> 15:27.821
I wish you all the best.

16:53.924 --> 16:55.173
Tomas.

16:56.870 --> 17:00.041
- Tomas!
- Uh! Let me sleep.

17:00.073 --> 17:02.091
What's going on?

17:02.123 --> 17:03.917
- I'm sleeping.
- No, no, no!

17:03.949 --> 17:06.768
Not here. You'll freeze to death.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.657
Come on, come inside.

17:23.809 --> 17:27.525
What's going on? I need to know.

17:27.557 --> 17:29.735
There was an accident.

17:29.767 --> 17:33.258
With... with the car. I ran over someone.

17:35.980 --> 17:38.896
- Oh, no.
- I wanna sleep.

17:40.305 --> 17:41.650
What...

17:43.476 --> 17:46.104
What happened to that person?

17:46.135 --> 17:47.993
I don't wanna talk.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.799
It's not getting any better.

19:38.952 --> 19:41.482
- What?
- You and me.

19:43.276 --> 19:45.134
We have to stop pretending.

19:48.753 --> 19:50.996
Can't this wait?

19:51.028 --> 19:53.493
- I can't do it anymore.
- You've just been through something so...

19:53.526 --> 19:55.704
I can't do it any longer, Sara.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.214
What do you mean?

20:01.246 --> 20:03.649
I mean I don't wanna do it any longer.

20:04.866 --> 20:06.723
Neither of us is fine.

20:08.518 --> 20:10.088
And we're not gonna be, and you know it.

20:10.119 --> 20:12.105
I... Let's not talk about this, not now.

20:12.137 --> 20:14.411
We want different things in life.

20:27.257 --> 20:29.787
Look, I, I just wanna write.

20:32.317 --> 20:34.143
You want kids.

20:34.176 --> 20:35.360
I don't.

20:36.609 --> 20:38.115
It's that simple.

20:39.396 --> 20:41.254
We just want different things.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.731
Thank you for coming.

22:57.005 --> 22:58.863
I gave 'em your number.

23:01.170 --> 23:03.028
I didn't have anyone else.

23:25.642 --> 23:26.387
That evening...

23:26.413 --> 23:28.646
I know what happened that evening, Tomas.

23:29.358 --> 23:31.216
It's a small town.

23:32.561 --> 23:35.380
You should have told me the whole thing.

23:35.412 --> 23:38.455
It's not your fault. It was an accident.

23:39.096 --> 23:40.378
Uh...

24:07.476 --> 24:09.109
How have you been?

24:12.505 --> 24:15.388
I'm tired too.

24:15.420 --> 24:18.143
I haven't slept properly the past four months.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.467
Have I been gone that long?

24:28.201 --> 24:30.059
Do you want me to come home?

24:31.179 --> 24:33.614
You can't ask that.

24:33.647 --> 24:35.984
You have to tell me what you want.

24:37.778 --> 24:39.636
That's what I want.

24:40.982 --> 24:42.840
I wanna come home.

24:47.259 --> 24:50.015
I don't know. I, I don't know.

24:52.256 --> 24:54.115
We're still the same.

24:57.702 --> 25:00.713
It never occurred to me

25:00.745 --> 25:03.788
that you could do something like this.

25:05.646 --> 25:08.497
The doctor says that it was half-hearted.

25:08.529 --> 25:09.971
The dosage was too small.

25:10.003 --> 25:14.519
That you did it at a time when
you knew you could be found.

25:14.551 --> 25:16.473
How am I to understand that?

25:16.506 --> 25:19.292
Why didn't you just hang a
'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door?

25:19.323 --> 25:21.407
Can you not do anything properly?

25:26.403 --> 25:28.229
Do you want me to try again?

25:33.803 --> 25:34.988
Oh.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.683
Let's see if we can get you out of here.

26:23.547 --> 26:28.545
Sara, you don't have to worry that I'm
gonna try something again, okay?

26:28.578 --> 26:31.076
I feel, I feel better now.

26:31.107 --> 26:34.118
I think I'll start writing again.

26:35.368 --> 26:38.347
Hmm. Good.

26:40.012 --> 26:43.120
- I have some ideas.
- You can use my study.

26:46.034 --> 26:47.379
You finished?

28:58.680 --> 29:00.217
Hmm.

29:00.248 --> 29:02.106
Back among the living, huh?

29:06.527 --> 29:07.677
Yeah.

29:09.058 --> 29:10.339
How have you been doin'?

29:10.370 --> 29:12.613
You don't sound so good, dad.

29:12.645 --> 29:14.759
I'm just doing nothing.

29:14.791 --> 29:16.777
Nothing all day long.

29:16.809 --> 29:17.899
You were looking forward to that.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.371
I was wrong.

29:19.403 --> 29:23.215
To tell you the truth, I'm down...

29:23.247 --> 29:25.618
But not without reason.

29:25.650 --> 29:27.091
What about you?

29:27.924 --> 29:30.743
Are you out of your mind?

29:30.775 --> 29:32.633
A suicide attempt?

29:33.658 --> 29:36.028
Trying to be an artist, is that it?

29:38.367 --> 29:39.744
- Anyway...
- Dad.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.607
What happened at the lab?

29:56.625 --> 29:59.732
I don't know why you still go there.
You always come back depressed.

30:02.103 --> 30:05.337
I was just grabbing a coffee
with old colleagues.

30:05.701 --> 30:08.477
Well, new people like to do
things their way.

30:08.508 --> 30:10.560
You should know this.
I mean, what do you expect?

30:10.591 --> 30:12.449
Some respect, for instance?

31:23.527 --> 31:25.930
I look at pictures of your mother, Tommy.

31:25.962 --> 31:31.119
And no matter how hard I try I can't
remember what it was that we had together.

31:31.151 --> 31:33.265
Dad, please.

31:33.298 --> 31:36.789
Hadn't you been around, we'd have split up.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.672
- So it's my fault?
- I never said that.

31:39.703 --> 31:41.721
I don't know why you speak
so bitterly about her.

31:41.754 --> 31:42.875
Bitter?

31:42.908 --> 31:44.604
Was she unfaithful to you, is that it?

31:44.637 --> 31:47.809
Your mother? Unfaithful?

31:47.840 --> 31:50.755
If only I'd been so lucky.

31:50.787 --> 31:54.663
But she was far too boring
to venture into that sort of thing.

31:56.489 --> 31:58.347
Man, why don't you just leave her alone?

31:58.379 --> 31:59.820
She can't defend herself anymore.

31:59.852 --> 32:01.646
Hmm.

32:10.166 --> 32:14.042
I have done everything wrong.

32:14.074 --> 32:15.355
The years with her.

32:15.387 --> 32:19.231
The years spent on meaningless
research at the lab.

32:20.321 --> 32:22.435
Just letting time pass...

32:24.261 --> 32:25.702
Until it's too late.

32:25.733 --> 32:27.463
- It's never too late, dad.
- What?

32:27.496 --> 32:32.013
Every time you come here,
all you give me are platitudes.

32:32.044 --> 32:34.927
"It's never too late, dad." Huh?

32:36.145 --> 32:41.269
Please, do not come here out of duty.

32:41.301 --> 32:44.184
You must have better things to do.

32:44.216 --> 32:46.009
Come if you like.

32:46.042 --> 32:51.007
But do not come because you feel you should.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.818
That's just belittling.

32:54.851 --> 32:56.709
I'll keep that in mind.

33:01.449 --> 33:03.115
What about Sara?

33:03.147 --> 33:06.285
I haven't seen her in such a long time.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.072
She's, uh, she's out looking at apartments.

33:09.105 --> 33:10.355
Here?

33:10.962 --> 33:13.685
You're thinking of moving into town?

33:13.718 --> 33:15.064
We're considering it.

33:41.093 --> 33:42.418
Hi.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.544
I couldn't sleep.

33:47.575 --> 33:50.106
When did you start smoking that stuff again?

33:51.836 --> 33:53.918
Don't worry, I'll quit soon.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.993
Hmm. It's kind of selfish.

33:57.922 --> 34:00.805
And I am worried.

34:03.367 --> 34:06.859
Just trying to relax
and take my mind off things.

34:06.890 --> 34:08.748
- Is that okay?
- No.

34:10.127 --> 34:12.880
Because it's not making things go away.

36:08.037 --> 36:10.182
Tom.

36:10.214 --> 36:12.073
It's great seein' you, man.

36:13.257 --> 36:15.403
Come in.

36:15.435 --> 36:17.613
Ann, can you leave us alone for a sec, please?

36:17.646 --> 36:19.503
Yes. Excuse us.

36:19.536 --> 36:20.753
Sit down.

36:26.454 --> 36:27.703
How're you doin'?

36:29.946 --> 36:31.227
Fine.

36:31.259 --> 36:33.694
I know what happened to you.

36:34.847 --> 36:36.704
We can talk about it.

36:38.434 --> 36:40.580
Not right now.

36:40.612 --> 36:42.470
Maybe later.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.940
I was just feeling really down.

36:50.639 --> 36:52.497
But I'm better now.

37:01.273 --> 37:06.804
The paradox with your kind
of work is that...

37:08.769 --> 37:12.036
Nearly everything, in one way or another

37:12.068 --> 37:14.823
can one day become a resource.

37:16.649 --> 37:19.499
How do you mean?

37:19.532 --> 37:22.766
Those three chapters you sent me last week.

37:22.799 --> 37:24.656
They definitely show...

37:25.809 --> 37:27.667
Something new.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.550
So you liked it?

37:30.582 --> 37:32.440
I liked it a lot. Yeah.

37:34.074 --> 37:35.931
But I rather don't wanna...

37:36.988 --> 37:39.071
You know, interfere at this stage.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.049
Just continue writing.

37:42.081 --> 37:44.644
Take all the time you need.

37:44.676 --> 37:46.535
You're on to something.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.517
I need help.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.520
I can't do this on my own.

38:57.965 --> 39:01.201
- How's Sara?
- Ah, it's difficult.

39:01.745 --> 39:02.931
Yeah.

39:02.963 --> 39:06.134
You know we've had our problems, but...

39:06.166 --> 39:08.536
I can feel little things coming back...

39:10.297 --> 39:14.110
Then other times I just feel
like giving up and starting over.

39:14.141 --> 39:15.904
With somebody else?

39:15.936 --> 39:18.210
No, just on my own.

39:18.241 --> 39:20.868
But... she's really been there for me.

39:22.502 --> 39:24.361
Have you talked to her about this?

39:26.442 --> 39:29.549
She might have similar feelings as you.

39:31.183 --> 39:32.849
I don't think so.

39:32.881 --> 39:35.443
You should talk to her.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.269
- Okay.
- Wait for me.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.159
Hold it, please.

39:44.156 --> 39:46.430
I'm Ann.

39:46.463 --> 39:48.320
I handle the French language books now.

39:49.505 --> 39:51.363
- I'm Tomas.
- I know.

39:53.061 --> 39:55.367
George let me read the first
chapters of the new book.

39:56.328 --> 39:58.186
Did he?

40:02.222 --> 40:04.784
I think it was out of pure enthusiasm.

40:04.817 --> 40:08.212
- He liked it so much.
- Me too.

40:08.244 --> 40:11.799
I liked both of your previous books
but I think this one could be even better.

40:13.657 --> 40:16.732
Well... there's still a long way to go.

40:22.242 --> 40:23.523
- Go ahead.
- Uh, no.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.574
I'm going down to the garage.

40:25.606 --> 40:26.886
Okay.

41:10.546 --> 41:12.404
I'm so excited to move.

41:15.414 --> 41:17.016
Leave Oka.

41:20.156 --> 41:22.238
You're going to love the place I found.

41:27.683 --> 41:29.541
What are you thinking?

41:30.790 --> 41:32.712
Talk to me, Tomas.

41:33.737 --> 41:35.594
What is it?

41:40.336 --> 41:41.745
No.

41:41.778 --> 41:43.282
No, come on.

41:43.315 --> 41:44.500
You're kidding me.

41:45.877 --> 41:47.319
Where did you leave him?

41:47.352 --> 41:49.081
Thank you, everyone, that was very nice.

41:51.995 --> 41:53.145
Thank you.

41:54.622 --> 41:58.242
They love you. This book,
it's gonna do a lot of good for ya.

41:59.555 --> 42:00.997
Hey, uh, Tom.

42:01.029 --> 42:03.175
- Yeah?
- Uh, I hate to bring this up.

42:03.207 --> 42:05.865
But, um...

42:05.898 --> 42:08.364
I need you to renew the contract.

42:08.397 --> 42:10.061
Oh, yeah, I'll sign it.

42:10.093 --> 42:11.439
You had it for 6 weeks.

42:11.472 --> 42:13.330
You worry too much, George.

43:15.823 --> 43:17.682
Come on. Come on.

43:34.114 --> 43:35.264
Hi.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.848
Why are you here?

43:43.402 --> 43:45.292
I thought I needed to see this place again.

43:48.721 --> 43:50.578
I couldn't let it go.

43:52.628 --> 43:54.486
So why today?

43:58.009 --> 43:59.900
If I could I would do anything to...

44:01.309 --> 44:03.167
To change what happened.

44:04.096 --> 44:05.441
I wish...

44:05.473 --> 44:07.330
Is that what you came to say?

44:10.470 --> 44:11.620
Maybe.

44:16.139 --> 44:18.029
Walk with me a bit.

44:26.838 --> 44:29.946
We can only try to believe
that there's a meaning to this.

44:32.892 --> 44:35.808
We've been praying for you
too, Christopher and I.

44:38.722 --> 44:41.189
And we don't blame you.

44:41.221 --> 44:43.079
It's not like that.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.218
How could it be your fault?

44:52.111 --> 44:53.970
Uh, well, I...

44:55.378 --> 44:58.775
I don't know if I could see it
that way if I was in your place.

45:07.135 --> 45:09.025
How have you been?

45:11.267 --> 45:12.420
Well...

45:15.303 --> 45:17.161
I've been pretty bad.

45:19.370 --> 45:21.901
I mean, I'm... a little better now, but...

45:23.406 --> 45:25.264
Look, uh...

45:28.884 --> 45:32.792
I, uh, I hope I haven't made things
more difficult by coming here.

45:35.579 --> 45:37.372
I just wanna say that...

45:38.462 --> 45:41.024
If there's anything I can do...

45:41.057 --> 45:43.652
Anything to help, I'd like to.

45:49.033 --> 45:51.499
It would make me feel a lot
better if I could...

45:53.004 --> 45:54.798
Do something for you.

46:14.370 --> 46:16.099
Could you wait here for a moment?

46:16.131 --> 46:17.765
I'd like to give you something.

47:08.696 --> 47:10.554
Maybe this can help you.

47:13.341 --> 47:14.491
Uh...

47:16.224 --> 47:18.145
I'm not really a religious person.

47:19.171 --> 47:21.028
Look at it anyway.

47:22.854 --> 47:24.712
You said you'd do something for us.

48:20.256 --> 48:22.113
Didn't he wanna come in?

48:23.555 --> 48:25.413
He was in a bit of a hurry.

48:26.150 --> 48:28.008
Will he be back?

48:32.396 --> 48:33.546
Perhaps.

48:39.731 --> 48:41.589
Goodnight, my love.

48:47.579 --> 48:49.405
I'll leave the door open.

48:50.141 --> 48:52.000
Goodnight, mom.

50:25.756 --> 50:26.906
Hello?

50:28.351 --> 50:30.721
Uh, I'm sorry to phone you at this hour.

50:33.124 --> 50:34.982
No, it's alright, I was up anyway.

50:36.776 --> 50:38.634
Can't you sleep well?

50:40.299 --> 50:43.887
Well, I've... I often... stay up to work.

50:45.521 --> 50:47.026
What do you do?

50:47.058 --> 50:48.915
Uh, I write.

50:50.294 --> 50:52.183
You're a writer?

50:52.216 --> 50:54.842
Yeah, I... I suppose I'm a writer.

50:57.084 --> 50:58.943
Have you had anything published?

51:01.184 --> 51:03.971
Yes. 3 novels.

51:05.541 --> 51:07.911
The... the 3rd one just came out.

51:14.222 --> 51:17.264
Was that why you were a bit dressed up today?

51:17.297 --> 51:20.468
Yeah, it was a... small reception.

51:20.499 --> 51:22.357
You're efficient.

51:23.543 --> 51:25.400
How do you mean?

51:27.226 --> 51:30.109
Well, you've already started on your next book.

51:32.191 --> 51:33.633
No, I just...

51:33.665 --> 51:36.259
I had a few ideas I was putting down.

51:40.711 --> 51:42.570
Was that why you came today?

51:44.267 --> 51:45.708
What do you mean?

51:45.741 --> 51:48.591
- Looking for ideas?
- No, no, no. Don't think that.

51:48.624 --> 51:54.133
I just... need to start something new,
you know before the reviews come out

51:54.165 --> 51:56.023
and everyone has an opinion.

51:56.055 --> 51:58.458
So, when is the next one coming out?

51:58.489 --> 52:02.333
Couple of years, if everything
goes according to plan.

52:06.241 --> 52:09.285
Does it usually go according to plan for you?

52:10.982 --> 52:12.841
Well, it depends.

52:14.185 --> 52:17.484
- What's your work?
- Uh, I make illustrations.

52:17.516 --> 52:20.848
For magazines, catalogues, books.

52:22.417 --> 52:23.891
So you're an artist?

52:23.923 --> 52:27.671
No. My drawings are commissioned.

52:28.824 --> 52:31.483
They're... made to order.

52:32.411 --> 52:34.813
You also work at home then?

52:34.846 --> 52:37.472
I need to work at home, for the boys.

52:39.330 --> 52:40.836
Is that Christopher?

52:40.868 --> 52:42.886
Can you wait just a second?

52:42.918 --> 52:44.776
I'll... I'll just check on him.

52:45.545 --> 52:47.402
Yeah, sure.

53:01.432 --> 53:02.582
Hello?

53:21.772 --> 53:22.922
Hmm.

53:48.552 --> 53:49.961
Are you there?

53:49.993 --> 53:51.143
Yes.

53:51.787 --> 53:53.933
Hmm.

53:53.965 --> 53:55.791
You don't have kids, do you?

53:56.527 --> 53:58.385
No, is it obvious?

54:00.819 --> 54:02.678
Yes, it is.

54:03.959 --> 54:05.849
By choice?

54:07.195 --> 54:09.309
No... no.

54:10.909 --> 54:12.768
No, I... I can't have kids.

54:16.259 --> 54:17.444
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:17.476 --> 54:19.943
Oh, just wasn't in the cards for me.

54:21.256 --> 54:22.921
Something you learn to live with.

55:43.483 --> 55:45.340
Thank you for coming.

55:48.480 --> 55:51.554
There's something I'd like for us to do.

55:53.476 --> 55:55.398
A little ceremony.

56:18.493 --> 56:20.383
Do you like Faulkner?

56:21.632 --> 56:22.782
Um...

56:24.451 --> 56:26.789
I don't like him and I don't not like him.

56:27.654 --> 56:30.121
Uh, most...

56:30.152 --> 56:32.011
Writers don't mean much to me.

56:34.477 --> 56:36.336
I knew you'd say that.

56:37.616 --> 56:39.474
I think I know you a little already.

56:56.291 --> 56:58.597
They shouldn't have been outside anymore.

56:59.718 --> 57:00.868
It was getting late.

57:03.018 --> 57:05.772
I should have taken them in.

57:05.804 --> 57:07.983
But I... I couldn't put that book down.

57:08.655 --> 57:10.513
He writes too well.

57:29.316 --> 57:33.096
I put a... name-tag
on his jacket the day before.

57:36.043 --> 57:37.900
I shouldn't have done that.

57:40.014 --> 57:41.873
Don't think that way.

57:44.275 --> 57:45.909
There's no connection.

57:47.125 --> 57:48.984
How do you know that?

57:50.745 --> 57:52.667
I just do.

57:54.237 --> 57:56.287
It's only in your mind.

57:59.298 --> 58:01.604
I shouldn't have done it.

58:03.398 --> 58:05.064
Shh.

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:42.149
This is how he remembers that day?

01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:45.256
Mm-hmm.

01:00:55.666 --> 01:00:57.717
I should go before he wakes.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:05.980
I won't see you again?

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:13.700
Thank you for asking me to come.

01:01:19.273 --> 01:01:22.573
He'll wake up soon. You should get going.

01:02:53.032 --> 01:02:54.182
Hey.

01:03:00.879 --> 01:03:03.922
- Hi.
- Hi. Isn't mummy coming?

01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:05.556
Umm-umm. We're gonna go meet her.

01:03:05.588 --> 01:03:07.702
Uh-huh, Mina.

01:03:07.734 --> 01:03:09.111
This way.

01:03:09.144 --> 01:03:11.514
- Aren't we going home?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:11.545 --> 01:03:13.628
Where are we going then?

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:16.864
- So many questions.
- Are we going to see a film?

01:03:18.786 --> 01:03:21.603
- Don't you like surprises?
- What does it start with?

01:03:21.636 --> 01:03:23.045
- What do you mean?
- The surprise.

01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:24.871
What's the first letter?

01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:27.562
Uh, F.

01:03:27.594 --> 01:03:28.971
One more letter.

01:03:29.003 --> 01:03:31.181
Mm... it'll be too easy.

01:03:31.213 --> 01:03:32.719
One more, please!

01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:34.353
Alright, I'll give you
a letter from the middle.

01:03:34.385 --> 01:03:37.076
- Okay.
- G.

01:03:37.107 --> 01:03:40.119
- I know what it is.
- Oh?

01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:41.431
What is it?

01:03:43.033 --> 01:03:44.859
Alright.

01:03:44.891 --> 01:03:47.615
We'll just see if you're right.

01:03:47.646 --> 01:03:49.633
The teacher said that you were in the paper.

01:03:49.664 --> 01:03:52.162
Did she? And what else did she say?

01:03:52.194 --> 01:03:54.341
She asked me if I was proud
to have such a famous dad.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.807
Mm-hmm. And what did you say?

01:03:56.839 --> 01:03:57.989
That you're not my dad.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.005
Can you see what she's reading?

01:04:10.036 --> 01:04:11.766
It's your book, Tomas!

01:04:11.798 --> 01:04:13.143
I'm sure she wants your autograph.

01:04:13.176 --> 01:04:14.326
No.

01:04:14.937 --> 01:04:16.507
Hey, no. Hey!

01:04:16.539 --> 01:04:17.820
Mina!

01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:19.326
Hi, do you like that book?

01:04:19.358 --> 01:04:21.055
That's the author over there.

01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:22.977
Do you want his autograph?

01:04:23.009 --> 01:04:26.149
Oh! Yes! I would love that.

01:04:26.181 --> 01:04:28.422
She does want your autograph!

01:04:35.278 --> 01:04:37.423
- I'm sorry about this.
- She wants an autograph.

01:04:37.455 --> 01:04:39.121
I would love you to sign the book.

01:04:39.153 --> 01:04:41.684
Okay. Sure. No problem.

01:05:28.226 --> 01:05:29.379
Hey, ta-da!

01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:32.070
Tomas has been signing his new book in a park.

01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:33.512
- Wow!
- It's the first time.

01:05:33.544 --> 01:05:34.921
Is it?

01:05:34.953 --> 01:05:38.349
Yeah, I mean, I've signed books
before but never out on the street.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.175
- He's a celebrity.
- No.

01:05:40.206 --> 01:05:43.377
It only counts if they ask for it,
not if somebody pushes it on them.

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.371
No, wait, keep it there, keep it right there.

01:05:53.403 --> 01:05:54.717
Keep it right there.

01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:55.678
You got it. You got it!

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:58.112
Oh!

01:05:58.144 --> 01:06:00.162
Champion!

01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:02.245
Alright. Look at that.

01:07:15.982 --> 01:07:17.359
It's just rain.

01:07:17.392 --> 01:07:21.395
Can we still go on the Ferris
wheel once the rain has stopped?

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.542
We didn't come here just
to sit around and eat, did we?

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.753
Well, hopefully, the rain will stop soon.

01:07:25.784 --> 01:07:29.564
But since we have a little time...

01:07:29.596 --> 01:07:31.742
- We have something to tell you.
- What?

01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:35.233
We've decided to move in together.

01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:38.148
- Where?
- Into Tomas' house.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.622
We're there most of the time, anyway.

01:07:39.653 --> 01:07:43.530
Yes, but now we'll move there
permanently with all our things.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:45.675
Do I get my own room?

01:07:45.707 --> 01:07:47.341
You'll stay in the room you stay in now.

01:07:47.374 --> 01:07:49.071
So it's all the same, really.

01:07:49.104 --> 01:07:50.449
No.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.716
How did I ever get such a rational daughter?

01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:55.894
We'll live together.

01:07:55.926 --> 01:07:57.528
We'll be a little family.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.289
Are you going to get married?

01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.436
I don't wanna be a flower girl.

01:08:09.924 --> 01:08:13.191
I know that deep
down inside she's happy about it.

01:08:13.224 --> 01:08:15.337
She just doesn't show it.

01:08:15.369 --> 01:08:17.546
She's such a mystery sometimes.

01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:27.093
What are you thinking about?
You're so quiet.

01:08:27.124 --> 01:08:28.274
Nothing.

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:31.448
I'm just feeling a little drained.

01:08:32.377 --> 01:08:33.658
Sorry.

01:09:02.233 --> 01:09:04.698
Can I go shoot some targets now?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.587
Where'd she go?

01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:24.654
Mina?

01:09:24.685 --> 01:09:26.545
Oh, my God!

01:09:28.402 --> 01:09:29.551
Mina?

01:09:31.285 --> 01:09:34.104
Hey, you okay?

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.185
Hey, Mina?

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.908
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:52.073
Let's lift it. Ready?

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.899
Okay, two, three.

01:09:53.932 --> 01:09:55.597
Alright, pull her out.

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.423
- Pull her out!
- I know!

01:10:35.413 --> 01:10:37.783
- Goodnight, my love.
- Goodnight, mom.

01:10:37.815 --> 01:10:38.965
Mmm.

01:10:39.962 --> 01:10:43.388
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams.

01:10:43.421 --> 01:10:45.664
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:10:58.444 --> 01:11:01.968
- She going to sleep?
- She'll be fine.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.281
Hmm.

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:09.175
I don't understand...

01:11:09.207 --> 01:11:11.289
How you can sit there and read...

01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:14.428
After a day like today.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.944
It's just my way of coping, Ann.

01:11:18.977 --> 01:11:21.347
You have your own way.

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.582
Is there nothing that can get to you?

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:28.746
What would you like to happen?

01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:33.936
Umm, I don't know if I like this.

01:11:36.178 --> 01:11:38.036
What don't you like?

01:11:39.893 --> 01:11:42.072
I watched you helping that woman.

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:45.659
You were so calm, so sure of yourself.

01:11:47.134 --> 01:11:48.959
Is there something wrong with that?

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:51.681
You would think you did this
kind of thing everyday.

01:11:54.756 --> 01:11:57.607
It's what happens in an... an emergency.

01:11:57.639 --> 01:12:00.169
You get focused and rational.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.821
The emergency is over now.

01:12:03.854 --> 01:12:06.223
So you want me to crack up a little?

01:12:13.687 --> 01:12:15.545
Look at me, Tomas.

01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.652
I'm shaking.

01:12:20.927 --> 01:12:22.785
Look at me.

01:12:24.546 --> 01:12:26.596
Show me your hands.

01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:28.487
Show me your hands!

01:12:29.671 --> 01:12:31.561
I'm not gonna show you my hand.

01:12:36.206 --> 01:12:38.929
I'd like to know exactly
what you're accusing me of.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.694
There are different ways
of dealing with a crisis.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.994
You have your way and I have my way.

01:12:48.025 --> 01:12:50.460
Stop patronizing me.

01:12:52.253 --> 01:12:53.403
You...

01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:57.122
You would think...

01:12:57.154 --> 01:13:02.185
After all you've been through in the past,
that you would at least be a little upset.

01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:06.700
That you'd be a little bit...

01:13:08.174 --> 01:13:09.583
Troubled.

01:13:14.451 --> 01:13:18.328
I should have known that one day
you would use that against me.

01:13:25.407 --> 01:13:28.131
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry, Tomas.

01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:45.779
You're not an easy man to live with.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.983
You know, you were right about that word.

01:14:21.015 --> 01:14:23.257
- Which word?
- The little word like.

01:14:23.289 --> 01:14:26.235
You said all my friends are using it
all the time, remember?

01:14:26.268 --> 01:14:28.157
Yeah, they do use it all the time.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:29.343
It's a disease!

01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:34.660
I didn't, like, notice it myself before,
that they can't, like, say a single thing

01:14:34.692 --> 01:14:36.839
without, like, adding that word.

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:39.177
And it, like, means nothing.

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:44.462
It's, like, a lot of, like empty
space in the, like, conversation.

01:14:44.494 --> 01:14:47.057
And it, like, flutters up, like, everything.

01:14:47.089 --> 01:14:50.388
Well, it's a good thing
that you, like, noticed that.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.592
So that you don't, like, fall into that trap.

01:14:56.217 --> 01:14:58.972
Oh, like, totally awesome!

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.911
Yes, I got it.

01:15:37.956 --> 01:15:39.172
Thanks.

01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:44.554
- It's not me.
- It's not finished.

01:15:48.494 --> 01:15:50.353
Come on, go back.

01:16:00.505 --> 01:16:02.749
You're getting more difficult to draw.

01:16:04.638 --> 01:16:06.560
I don't know why.

01:16:20.654 --> 01:16:22.256
Dad?

01:16:44.038 --> 01:16:46.921
There was this man with a dog at a bus stop...

01:16:46.953 --> 01:16:48.842
And it was really windy.

01:16:51.181 --> 01:16:55.376
And all of a sudden, a... a big gust
of wind and he just toppled over.

01:16:55.409 --> 01:16:57.620
He looked really funny.

01:16:58.932 --> 01:17:00.630
I couldn't help but laugh.

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:02.521
Other people were laughing too.

01:17:03.705 --> 01:17:05.659
I swear even his dog was laughing.

01:17:08.062 --> 01:17:11.041
When he got back up, he started,
like, taking it out on the dog.

01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:14.532
You know, pulling at its
leash as if he was to blame.

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:16.902
Poor thing.

01:17:16.935 --> 01:17:18.824
Yeah.

01:17:18.857 --> 01:17:20.714
I felt really bad for the dog.

01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:25.423
You're making this all up, aren't you?

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.466
Where is the boy?

01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:32.950
- What boy?
- Did he quit?

01:17:36.217 --> 01:17:37.658
Come here.

01:17:38.812 --> 01:17:40.286
Here we go.

01:17:42.271 --> 01:17:44.578
How do I look?

01:17:44.611 --> 01:17:46.692
You look great.

01:17:46.725 --> 01:17:49.543
He is looking old, that old man.

01:17:49.575 --> 01:17:51.593
Old, old, old...

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.707
No one looks as good as you, dad.

01:17:53.739 --> 01:17:56.910

01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:09.980
He's not gonna make it.

01:18:10.011 --> 01:18:11.485
Dad.

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.296
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:15.329 --> 01:18:17.218
Let's go. Come on.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.646
Okay.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.320

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:46.848
I want to go to the river.

01:18:47.809 --> 01:18:49.154
What?

I don't think it's gonna work.

01:19:24.454 --> 01:19:26.888
No, we'll still go.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.098

You're still sitting
near the exit, just like always.

01:22:27.261 --> 01:22:29.118

<i>It was an accident. It
wasn't anyone's fault.</i>

01:25:15.589 --> 01:25:18.408
<i>I'm 16 now and still live with my mother.</i>

01:25:18.439 --> 01:25:19.976
<i>I read a lot and like to write.</i>

01:25:20.009 --> 01:25:22.571
<i>Your books are among my favorites.</i>

01:25:22.604 --> 01:25:25.166
<i>One day, maybe I'll be a writer like you.</i>

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:27.056
<i>I bet you're wondering why I'm writing to you.</i>

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:29.907
<i>During my childhood,
there's been all sorts of issues.</i>

01:25:29.939 --> 01:25:32.373
<i>I guess I've been some sort of a problem child.</i>

01:25:32.405 --> 01:25:35.865
<i>The school psychologist thinks it would be good
for me to meet you.</i>

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:38.844
<i>That it can help a few things
to fall into place.</i>

01:25:38.876 --> 01:25:40.990
<i>I would really like to meet and have a chat.</i>

01:25:41.021 --> 01:25:42.400
<i>I hope that's okay for you.</i>

01:25:42.432 --> 01:25:45.571
<i>It would be good if you could write back
and say when and where we could meet.</i>

01:25:45.602 --> 01:25:49.254
<i>Oh, PS, mother doesn't know that I'm
writing this letter to you.</i>

01:26:28.973 --> 01:26:31.313
- She's my favorite character.
- Why?

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:34.292
She is best friends with her.

01:26:40.025 --> 01:26:41.883
They're always fighting though.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.681
<i>Dear Christopher, thanks for your nice letter.</i>

01:26:47.713 --> 01:26:50.756
<i>As you might imagine
I was very surprised to hear from you.</i>

01:26:50.787 --> 01:26:53.958
<i>Even though many years have passed
I've never forgotten the day we met.</i>

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:55.849
<i>How could I?</i>

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.643
<i>You want the two of us
to meet for a little chat.</i>

01:26:57.674 --> 01:27:02.223
<i>To be honest, I'm afraid of what feelings
might be stirred up by that.</i>

01:27:02.256 --> 01:27:05.714
<i>At least you would have to wait for a while.
I'm in the final phase with my new novel.</i>

01:27:05.746 --> 01:27:09.687
<i>At this stage, I can't risk
becoming emotionally unbalanced.</i>

01:27:09.719 --> 01:27:11.288
<i>I was pleased to hear that you like my books.</i>

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.985
<i>They're really not written
for people of your age.</i>

01:27:13.018 --> 01:27:14.748
<i>I wish you well.
Sincerely, Tomas.</i>

01:27:25.223 --> 01:27:27.080
What time is it?

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:31.821
Mmm.

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:40.474
Hello?

01:27:40.574 --> 01:27:43.289
Why don't you want to meet Christopher?

01:27:43.321 --> 01:27:46.139
It's the middle of the night.

01:27:46.172 --> 01:27:48.862
It took him a lot of courage to contact you.

01:27:50.143 --> 01:27:51.905
There are things he needs to sort out.

01:27:51.937 --> 01:27:55.620
Look, all I said was that maybe
there was a better time.

01:27:55.652 --> 01:27:58.824
"I can't risk becoming emotionally unbalanced."

01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.714
- He's only 16.
- Look.

01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:04.237
You know I wrote that letter
for him, not for you.

01:28:04.269 --> 01:28:06.319
I found it.

01:28:06.352 --> 01:28:08.209
He hasn't tried to hide it.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:12.406
Alright. That came out wrong.

01:28:12.437 --> 01:28:14.839
You said you'd do something for us.

01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:17.754
- Have you forgotten?
- No, I haven't forgotten.

01:28:18.812 --> 01:28:21.022
I'll talk to him whenever he wants to.

01:28:22.367 --> 01:28:24.225
Who was it?

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:27.044
Uh, just a reader.

01:28:30.023 --> 01:28:32.298
- At this time of night?
- Yeah.

01:28:35.148 --> 01:28:39.344
In the last book, there was something
she couldn't understand.

01:28:39.376 --> 01:28:41.586
She sounded a bit disturbed.

01:28:42.836 --> 01:28:43.986
Hmm.

01:29:02.599 --> 01:29:04.425
I have a question for you.

01:29:04.457 --> 01:29:06.507
Umm...

01:29:06.539 --> 01:29:09.230
There's a chapter in "Winter" where...

01:29:09.262 --> 01:29:12.337
This man carries a boy on his shoulders.

01:29:15.092 --> 01:29:16.949
Is that me?

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.761
- Is it you?
- I don't know.

01:29:20.793 --> 01:29:22.652
I've always felt as if it was me.

01:29:24.733 --> 01:29:29.955
You know, he... he has the boy
on his shoulders like this, holding his legs.

01:29:32.197 --> 01:29:34.151
Well, I...

01:29:34.183 --> 01:29:35.913
I... I have a daughter.

01:29:35.945 --> 01:29:39.468
It's a fairly common way to carry children.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.967
It's only your stepdaughter, right?

01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:43.856
How do you know that?

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.398
I must have read it somewhere.

01:29:52.313 --> 01:29:54.747
You said that you write a little bit?

01:29:56.765 --> 01:29:58.559
Now and then.

01:29:58.591 --> 01:30:03.717
Then maybe you understand
that when you write...

01:30:03.748 --> 01:30:09.386
Ideas can come
from all different kinds of places.

01:30:09.418 --> 01:30:15.889
You know, some come from experience
and others are based in imagination.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.932
And it's not always easy to tell them apart.

01:30:18.964 --> 01:30:22.615
My school psychologist says
I'm a bit hung up on you.

01:30:29.502 --> 01:30:31.392
What you and I went through...

01:30:32.545 --> 01:30:33.826
That day...

01:30:34.947 --> 01:30:36.965
Was out of the ordinary.

01:30:38.983 --> 01:30:41.834
It was an experience that causes scars.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.166
Permanent scars.

01:30:47.889 --> 01:30:49.778
And over time...

01:30:51.092 --> 01:30:53.398
Maybe you start thinking differently about it.

01:30:53.429 --> 01:30:57.370
You know, memory can play tricks on us
and you maybe even start blaming yourself...

01:30:57.403 --> 01:30:59.772
It just seems a little unfair.

01:30:59.805 --> 01:31:01.117
What's unfair?

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.442
I mean, look at your success
compared to my mom.

01:31:09.286 --> 01:31:11.592
That doesn't have anything to do with it.

01:31:13.194 --> 01:31:15.147
Look, I...

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.038
It took me years...

01:31:17.967 --> 01:31:19.825
To put that accident behind me.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.283
I was in a very bad place.

01:31:23.316 --> 01:31:25.174
I was at a bottom.

01:31:28.217 --> 01:31:29.434
But then I moved on.

01:31:29.466 --> 01:31:31.676
Books from before the accident weren't as good.

01:31:39.171 --> 01:31:41.030
I'm a writer.

01:31:41.991 --> 01:31:44.617
It's what I do professionally.

01:31:44.649 --> 01:31:46.763
I write books.

01:31:46.796 --> 01:31:48.877
And with each new book, hopefully
I get a little better.

01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:52.016
That's all there is to it.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.405
I, uh...

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:03.483
I don't think we're gonna gain anything
by stirring up all this.

01:32:04.444 --> 01:32:06.303
It's been years.

01:32:45.734 --> 01:32:47.752
Excuse me.

01:33:11.488 --> 01:33:13.345
Can you sign these for me?

01:33:57.486 --> 01:33:59.985
- Alright.
- Bye.

01:34:00.017 --> 01:34:01.458
See ya.

01:34:24.809 --> 01:34:26.859
Then you can follow me
to the storage place, alright?

01:34:26.892 --> 01:34:28.749
Yeah, alright. Okay.

01:36:06.671 --> 01:36:09.393
Where do you want your award?

01:36:09.426 --> 01:36:11.283
It doesn't matter.

01:36:12.244 --> 01:36:15.096
Don't pretend you don't care.

01:36:15.127 --> 01:36:18.298
- Where do you want it?
- On the mantle.

01:36:18.331 --> 01:36:19.964
Good choice.

01:36:22.527 --> 01:36:25.249
Who did not close the window?

01:36:25.282 --> 01:36:27.396
That is one meaningless question.

01:36:27.428 --> 01:36:29.189
Why?

01:36:29.222 --> 01:36:31.368
Maybe it opened by itself.

01:36:32.874 --> 01:36:34.474
I'm serious.

01:36:35.949 --> 01:36:38.447
I didn't open it.

01:36:38.478 --> 01:36:41.105
The point is the last one out closes it.

01:36:41.137 --> 01:36:42.547
Alright. Maybe... maybe I did it.

01:36:42.579 --> 01:36:45.302
- I'm the one who sinned.
- It's not a sin.

01:36:46.807 --> 01:36:48.153
Maybe a little ghostie did it.

01:36:50.906 --> 01:36:53.854
I hate coming home when the window is open.

01:36:53.886 --> 01:36:56.096
Gives me the creeps.

01:36:58.114 --> 01:37:00.805
Well, these shoes are killing me.

01:37:11.696 --> 01:37:15.027
I think the ending's finally
falling into place.

01:37:16.468 --> 01:37:20.537
So what's the answer to the big question?

01:37:20.569 --> 01:37:22.171
Will he come back?

01:37:24.093 --> 01:37:27.039
Yeah, I don't... I don't feel
like any of the other options make sense.

01:37:30.755 --> 01:37:33.542
- You don't like it?
- Hmm, I do.

01:37:33.574 --> 01:37:36.104
No, you don't. I can tell.

01:37:36.136 --> 01:37:38.347
Frankly...

01:37:38.378 --> 01:37:41.390
It just seems a little... lame.

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.856
Ah! Lame?

01:37:48.532 --> 01:37:51.384
Well, the editor said the same thing.

01:37:51.415 --> 01:37:53.113
He just wasn't so blunt about it.

01:37:55.644 --> 01:37:57.342
Maybe you're right.

01:38:28.093 --> 01:38:29.847
What's that smell?

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.449
- Ann, get up.
- What's that?

01:38:39.303 --> 01:38:41.161
It's pee, Tomas.

01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:43.788
Someone peed on our bed!

01:38:49.873 --> 01:38:52.501
Is there anyone you suspect that might
have done something like this?

01:38:52.533 --> 01:38:54.263
- Umm-umm.
- You in conflict with anyone?

01:38:54.294 --> 01:38:56.729
Any of the neighbors?

01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:58.618
No. Not that I know of.

01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:04.129
Any of the children in the street
that may have something against you?

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.858
I don't think so.

01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:09.510
Where were you when this happened?

01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:12.329
We were in Toronto. I had a reading.

01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:14.026
My daughter and my wife were with me.

01:39:14.058 --> 01:39:17.998
After, we went to dinner and then
flew back and drove here.

01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:21.201
- A reading?
- He's a writer.

01:39:21.234 --> 01:39:24.052
He received the Giller Prize.

01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:26.967
Oh, I'm sorry. I should probably know you.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.216
It's okay.

01:39:28.249 --> 01:39:30.715
So what are the chances
of catching this person?

01:39:30.747 --> 01:39:33.309
Chances of finding this person are not great.

01:39:34.975 --> 01:39:37.249
Get in touch if you find
that there's something missing.

01:39:37.282 --> 01:39:41.446
And, uh, try to think about who might
bear a grudge against you.

01:39:47.468 --> 01:39:49.325
Not very helpful, were they?

01:39:51.439 --> 01:39:53.906
We can't sleep here tonight.

01:39:53.938 --> 01:39:56.533
Why don't you two go and stay at your parents?

01:39:56.565 --> 01:39:58.006
Hey, I'll stay here.

01:39:58.038 --> 01:40:01.369
I'll get a cleaning crew to come here
and we'll clean the entire place.

01:41:06.619 --> 01:41:07.804
Hmm.

01:43:19.456 --> 01:43:21.633
Do you do this often?

01:43:21.666 --> 01:43:23.523
Pee in people's houses?

01:43:26.022 --> 01:43:27.880
Only on beds.

01:43:30.859 --> 01:43:33.229
A man of principles. That's good.

01:43:40.725 --> 01:43:42.294
I'm impressed.

01:43:43.576 --> 01:43:45.753
- Impressed?
- Yeah.

01:43:47.324 --> 01:43:48.924
Takes guts.

01:44:23.616 --> 01:44:25.825
How's your mother?

01:44:25.858 --> 01:44:27.395
Fine.

01:44:30.086 --> 01:44:31.944
She sold the house.

01:44:32.936 --> 01:44:34.315
Hmm.

01:44:36.492 --> 01:44:39.183
I'm in college now, so
she started traveling again.

01:44:42.835 --> 01:44:44.981
She's in England visiting grandma.

01:45:38.954 --> 01:45:40.268
Okay.

01:45:47.252 --> 01:45:48.916
Over here.

01:45:51.927 --> 01:45:53.593
Up. Up.

01:45:57.373 --> 01:45:59.231
Okay. That's fine.

01:46:23.832 --> 01:46:26.171
You gonna make it in time for school?

01:46:26.202 --> 01:46:27.740
Yeah, easy.

01:46:33.313 --> 01:46:34.658
