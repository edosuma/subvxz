WEBVTT

00:04.033 --> 00:06.135
Well, there's a sight
that never gets old.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.505
You know, if men knew how sexy
they looked fixing stuff,

00:09.506 --> 00:10.807
they'd never stop.

00:10.808 --> 00:12.442
I can't feel my hands.

00:12.443 --> 00:13.810
Well, why don't you
bring them down here

00:13.811 --> 00:16.111
and let me do something about it?

00:16.846 --> 00:18.715
Where are the kids?

00:18.716 --> 00:22.352
They're out riding... till dark.

00:22.353 --> 00:25.488
I should really finish up here.

00:25.489 --> 00:27.490
Okay.

00:27.491 --> 00:28.958
I'll go riding, too.

00:28.959 --> 00:31.361
Coming down.

00:31.362 --> 00:33.596
Oh, man, it's so silent here.

00:33.597 --> 00:36.466
I'd forgotten what that sounded like.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.801
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:38.802 --> 00:40.136
We shouldn't sell.

00:40.137 --> 00:42.505
- We so shouldn't sell!
- But wait,

00:42.506 --> 00:44.374
you're the one that tried to
convince me that we should.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.676
Well, it's hard keeping up two homes.

00:46.677 --> 00:48.378
And we hardly even ever get back here.

00:48.379 --> 00:51.214
Yeah, upkeep on the property,
the horses, the repairs.

00:51.215 --> 00:52.849
I know. I was present
for that conversation.

00:52.850 --> 00:53.883
Present and persuaded...

00:53.884 --> 00:56.018
On the other hand, this is home.

00:56.019 --> 00:57.687
I mean, this is where we're gonna come

00:57.688 --> 00:59.288
back to after my job, right?

00:59.289 --> 01:00.923
This is our normal.

01:00.924 --> 01:02.492
Yeah, but what happened
to never looking back?

01:02.493 --> 01:03.659
I'm looking forward.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.295
- To getting back to our old selves.
- Yeah, but...

01:06.296 --> 01:09.465
You know, your job could go on
for several more years, babe.

01:09.466 --> 01:11.868
- So...
- All the more reason to have a touchstone.

01:11.869 --> 01:13.202
We shouldn't sell.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.871
On the other hand,

01:14.872 --> 01:17.540
did you see the electric
bill from the horse barn?

01:17.541 --> 01:19.909
- Okay.
- And the property taxes are insane.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.344
You see how you just...

01:21.345 --> 01:23.079
I'm verbally processing. I'm...

01:23.080 --> 01:24.347
Hey.

01:24.348 --> 01:25.515
What are you guys doing back?

01:25.516 --> 01:28.217
Hey, we saw a rabbit chasing a fox!

01:28.218 --> 01:30.620
- Uh, don't you mean...?
- JASON: Nope.

01:30.621 --> 01:32.388
Huge rabbit, skinny fox.

01:32.389 --> 01:34.791
- There's a parable there.
- (laughs)

01:34.792 --> 01:36.926
I posted a picture on Instagram,
and it got 200 likes.

01:36.927 --> 01:38.928
Yeah, way to be at one with nature.

01:38.929 --> 01:40.496
ALISON: You're just
jealous because people

01:40.497 --> 01:42.406
- actually care what I'm doing.
- Look, your friends

01:42.407 --> 01:43.933
looked at your photo and
then tapped it twice.

01:43.934 --> 01:45.501
Look out, Taylor Swift.

01:45.502 --> 01:47.103
Okay, everybody, to the barn.

01:47.104 --> 01:48.271
You guys feed them, rub them down,

01:48.272 --> 01:50.106
and then muck out the stalls, all right?

01:50.107 --> 01:51.174
- It's freezing.
- Come on.

01:51.175 --> 01:52.375
Please, can we do it after?

01:52.376 --> 01:54.074
- No.
- STEVIE: Not a chance.

01:54.075 --> 01:56.045
She loves these horses
more than she loves us.

01:56.046 --> 01:57.480
Because they don't talk back.

01:57.481 --> 01:58.948
- What is...?
- (groans)

01:58.949 --> 02:00.783
ELIZABETH: What are they doing?
They're not supposed to be here

02:00.784 --> 02:01.918
for another three hours.

02:01.919 --> 02:03.519
The cell reception is terrible.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.521
- Well, that's another reason we should...
- Stop!

02:05.522 --> 02:07.156
NADINE: Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

02:07.157 --> 02:09.125
Sorry!

02:09.126 --> 02:10.693
We've been calling since this morning,

02:10.693 --> 02:12.562
but, uh, we didn't have any signal.

02:12.563 --> 02:13.696
What is that smell?

02:13.697 --> 02:15.031
NADINE: We have good news.

02:15.032 --> 02:16.732
They reached an agreement in Brussels

02:16.733 --> 02:18.234
to solve the Greek debt crisis.

02:18.235 --> 02:20.390
Oh, thank God! And horse crap.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.871
I beg your pardon?

02:21.872 --> 02:23.339
That's what that smell is.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.578
- Oh. - HENRY: Well, another
global depression avoided.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.572
- Lunch?
- NADINE: Thank you.

02:27.573 --> 02:28.773
But we really need to get going.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.676
Russell Jackson's been
calling all morning.

02:31.677 --> 02:33.912
Well, that is until we lost our signals.

02:33.913 --> 02:35.580
The president wants to see you, ma'am.

02:35.581 --> 02:38.316
I'm sure it's about the Brussels trip.

02:38.317 --> 02:39.784
Sorry, would you mind
if I used your bathroom

02:39.785 --> 02:41.019
before we get going?

02:41.020 --> 02:43.387
- Yeah.
- Yeah, any place behind the barn is fine.

02:46.091 --> 02:48.193
Oh, ha-ha. Mock the city mouse.

02:48.194 --> 02:50.395
QUINN: <i>The Greeks are acting
like spoiled children.</i>

02:50.396 --> 02:53.031
They don't like spending cuts.
They don't want to be audited.

02:53.032 --> 02:56.067
As if they earned the right
to dictate terms to anyone.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.569
Come in, Elizabeth.

02:57.570 --> 03:00.305
You know the former Treasury Secretary.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.339
Of course. Hey, Max.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.108
How's life in the private sector?

03:03.109 --> 03:04.376
(chuckles) Peachy.

03:04.377 --> 03:05.577
Until today.

03:05.578 --> 03:07.779
Our old friend is sharing his opinion

03:07.780 --> 03:09.748
of the Greek financial
agreement we brokered.

03:09.749 --> 03:11.916
- Ah.
- QUINN: The short version is

03:11.917 --> 03:14.552
my hedge fund's investors
are getting shafted.

03:14.553 --> 03:16.021
- You see an alternative?
- Absolutely!

03:16.022 --> 03:18.490
Insist on additional austerity measures.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.159
Make the Greeks accountable
for the promises they made.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.694
I wish we could, but the Greek economy

03:22.695 --> 03:23.762
is on the verge of collapse.

03:23.763 --> 03:25.263
Believe me, this is
the best we could do.

03:25.264 --> 03:26.264
I doubt that.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.899
Sir, letting the Greeks

03:27.900 --> 03:30.101
off the hook will set
a terrible precedent.

03:30.102 --> 03:32.303
You'll erode confidence
in the entire bond market.

03:32.304 --> 03:35.006
And if the Greeks
default, we're looking at

03:35.007 --> 03:36.307
worldwide panic.

03:36.308 --> 03:38.143
There won't be a bond market left.

03:38.144 --> 03:40.311
<i>If</i> they default. Mr. President,

03:40.312 --> 03:43.214
there is still time
to do the right thing.

03:43.215 --> 03:45.316
I strongly recommend that
you scuttle this agreement

03:45.317 --> 03:47.252
and get tough with the Greeks.

03:47.253 --> 03:50.288
A restructure closer to
50 cents on the dollar.

03:50.289 --> 03:52.257
I appreciate your counsel, Max.

03:52.258 --> 03:54.125
But it's a done deal.

03:54.126 --> 03:55.727
I suggest you get your
hedge fund in line.

03:55.728 --> 03:58.329
Better to get some fraction
of your investment back

03:58.330 --> 04:00.832
than nothing at all.

04:00.833 --> 04:02.634
What a waste of time.

04:02.635 --> 04:05.103
Your anti-business stance

04:05.104 --> 04:08.406
is not gonna serve you
in the next election, comrade.

04:08.407 --> 04:10.240
Mark my words.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.082
Funny, isn't it?

04:17.083 --> 04:20.218
How these courtesy meetings never are.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.519
I can't make everybody happy.

04:21.519 --> 04:24.422
Mr. President, you have made
most of Europe very happy

04:24.423 --> 04:25.924
with this agreement.

04:25.925 --> 04:27.092
Which is why I'm recommending

04:27.093 --> 04:28.393
that you make the trip to Brussels

04:28.394 --> 04:30.361
- to sign the deal.
- It's not the best time.

04:30.362 --> 04:32.430
Actually, it's the perfect time.

04:32.431 --> 04:33.565
It's a victory lap.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.266
- And you need one.
- I agree.

04:35.267 --> 04:36.367
I think you should go.

04:36.368 --> 04:37.769
You show up in Brussels,

04:37.770 --> 04:39.771
the other world leaders
won't be able to stay away.

04:39.772 --> 04:41.272
Makes it clear the world economy is

04:41.273 --> 04:43.441
being scrutinized at the highest levels.

04:43.442 --> 04:46.044
And the optics will be good
for my polling numbers.

04:46.045 --> 04:47.846
I'm not apologizing for that.

04:47.847 --> 04:49.314
After everything with Iran...

04:49.315 --> 04:50.748
It's a big win.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.283
And you need to put
yourself in front of it.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.422
Who would bring in

04:57.423 --> 05:01.926
this salt-coated,
saturated-fat-loaded, super...

05:01.927 --> 05:03.628
My mother.

05:03.629 --> 05:05.663
...delicious and satisfying snack.

05:05.664 --> 05:07.732
I bring it here so I won't eat it.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.234
You could just throw it away.

05:09.235 --> 05:10.235
I can't!

05:10.236 --> 05:12.504
I deal with people
in starving countries.

05:12.505 --> 05:14.205
I agree that it's wrong
to throw away food,

05:14.206 --> 05:16.374
but what does that
have to do with this?

05:16.375 --> 05:18.343
Are we having our first
cute workplace fight?

05:18.344 --> 05:20.044
- No, we're just talking.
- Aw.

05:20.045 --> 05:22.046
I think we are. I think we
should mark the occasion.

05:22.047 --> 05:23.195
- Are you crazy? Stop it!
- "Crazy"?

05:23.196 --> 05:24.149
Someone's gonna walk in.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.050
- I'm a moderate risk taker.
- (phone chimes)

05:26.051 --> 05:28.620
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.221
Everything okay?

05:30.222 --> 05:32.757
It's my magical disappearing friend.

05:32.758 --> 05:33.791
(chuckles)

05:33.792 --> 05:35.260
Everybody has one.

05:35.261 --> 05:36.561
Seriously.

05:36.562 --> 05:37.896
We knew each other as kids.

05:37.897 --> 05:40.765
We were really close friends
in high school, and then

05:40.766 --> 05:42.467
he just became a swooper, you know?

05:42.468 --> 05:45.837
Don't hear from him for ages,
then he swoops in and asks,

05:45.838 --> 05:47.539
"Why aren't we hanging out anymore?"

05:47.540 --> 05:48.706
- So he's back?
- Yeah.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.141
As if nothing ever happened.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.011
"Want to have lunch with me
at my house today, Ginjy".

05:53.012 --> 05:54.646
- "Ginjy"?
- Yeah.

05:54.647 --> 05:55.914
Ginger head. It...

05:55.915 --> 05:57.348
It's, like, an inside joke.

05:57.349 --> 05:59.117
- He's colorblind.
- He's-he's a guy?

05:59.118 --> 06:01.019
Yeah.

06:01.020 --> 06:04.155
An immature swooper guy
who calls me Ginjy.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.024
Go.

06:06.025 --> 06:08.292
Go have lunch with your friend.

06:14.966 --> 06:17.135
Um, I'm here to see Harrison Dalton.

06:17.136 --> 06:19.003
HARRISON: Hey! Hey.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.572
- Hey!
- You made it!

06:20.573 --> 06:21.873
- (both laugh)
- Mr. Dalton,

06:21.874 --> 06:23.341
- you really shouldn't.
- I'm sorry.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.210
Nobody cares about the president's kid.

06:25.211 --> 06:27.812
- STEVIE: Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, it's you! Ginjy!

06:27.813 --> 06:29.280
(laughing): Wait, wait, wait, my wallet!

06:29.281 --> 06:32.115
Get your wallet.
Thank you, Brian. Sorry!

06:38.022 --> 06:39.857
Oh!

06:39.858 --> 06:41.893
(laughs)

06:41.894 --> 06:43.361
You should be way better at this.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.897
I mean, you have a bowling alley
inside of your actual house.

06:45.898 --> 06:47.402
This is temporary lodgings.

06:47.403 --> 06:49.667
I don't actually live with my
parents; that'd be pathetic.

06:49.668 --> 06:51.703
What happened to grad school?

06:51.704 --> 06:54.405
You haven't heard?

06:54.406 --> 06:57.542
I am straight out of rehab.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.511
Oh.

07:00.512 --> 07:02.714
- Uh...
- Yeah, awkward.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.383
Uh, I thought my dad told your
mom, and that you would, uh...

07:05.384 --> 07:06.417
Nope.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.820
You want to ask?

07:08.821 --> 07:10.054
- I don't want to ask.
- Ask.

07:10.055 --> 07:10.710
- I don't.
- Ask.

07:10.711 --> 07:13.258
- I don't want to ask.
- Oxy.

07:13.259 --> 07:15.026
And, yeah, I ended up
hitting the streets

07:15.027 --> 07:18.196
after that got too
expensive, and I am your...

07:18.197 --> 07:20.431
basic <i>Dr. Phil</i> episode.

07:20.432 --> 07:22.900
With the added bonus
of being the first son.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.736
(both laugh)

07:24.737 --> 07:26.638
It's amazing the old

07:26.639 --> 07:28.339
baseball cap and sunglasses disguise

07:28.340 --> 07:30.041
actually works on heroin dealers.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.009
Wow.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.478
Managed to avoid <i>TMZ.</i>

07:33.479 --> 07:35.179
You're... okay now?

07:35.180 --> 07:36.281
I'm killing it.

07:36.282 --> 07:37.881
90 meetings, 90 days.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.585
I'm good. I'm lucky.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.720
Yes, you are.

07:42.721 --> 07:44.222
And just when I thought I had run out

07:44.223 --> 07:45.490
of ways to disappoint my father.

07:45.491 --> 07:46.924
(laughs) Oh, come on.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.526
He doesn't think of you like that.

07:48.527 --> 07:50.128
He knows that it's hard being you.

07:50.129 --> 07:52.196
You are the sister I never had, Ginjy.

07:52.197 --> 07:54.165
Oh! (laughs)

07:54.166 --> 07:56.234
Fellow CIA brat who knows
what it's like to grow up

07:56.235 --> 07:58.503
in a house of secrets and lies.

07:58.504 --> 08:00.738
Well, as your honorary
sister, I think it's time

08:00.739 --> 08:03.274
that I tell you to stop talking
like you're in a Chekov play.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.676
That was the 12th step.

08:04.677 --> 08:07.145
Acknowledging that you're not
in a Russian parlor drama.

08:07.146 --> 08:08.646
Hey, I know I say this a lot,

08:08.647 --> 08:11.816
but I-I... I wish that we did this more.

08:11.817 --> 08:14.919
You know? We could be like
we used to be, only smarter

08:14.920 --> 08:15.920
and better-looking.

08:15.921 --> 08:17.388
I'm way ahead of you there.

08:17.389 --> 08:18.688
So...

08:19.957 --> 08:22.225
No! No!

08:26.898 --> 08:28.333
Extra care here, gentlemen.

08:28.334 --> 08:30.101
Let's get these beauties home to Greece

08:30.102 --> 08:32.337
with all their fingers and toes.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.705
The ones they still have anyway.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.673
We'll take them from here.

08:35.674 --> 08:36.506
Excuse me?

08:36.508 --> 08:37.909
I'm taking these statues.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.311
I have no authorization
to release these to anyone.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.113
Now you do.

08:42.114 --> 08:43.581
You see <i>Repo Man?</i>

08:43.582 --> 08:46.050
That's a court order giving
me permission to repossess

08:46.051 --> 08:49.420
the statues to pay a debt
owed by the Greek government.

08:49.421 --> 08:51.456
Call whoever you want.

08:51.457 --> 08:54.292
They're mine now.

08:54.293 --> 08:57.929
MATT: <i>"Under cover of darkness,
Global M-7 Hedge Fund owner</i>

08:57.930 --> 09:01.065
"Max Quinn pulled off the most audacious

09:01.066 --> 09:03.201
"and expensive repo of all time,

09:03.202 --> 09:07.271
seizing Greece's priceless
Spartan Figures of Democracy."

09:07.272 --> 09:08.740
Man, he just took them!

09:08.741 --> 09:10.241
He didn't even have a gun.

09:10.242 --> 09:12.377
He didn't need a gun.
He had a court order.

09:12.378 --> 09:14.345
Wonder what he used
to get the court order.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.546
He's the former treasury secretary.

09:15.547 --> 09:17.515
He used his cell phone.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.284
The Greeks have owed him
$1.3 billion for ten years.

09:20.285 --> 09:21.753
Those same Greeks are

09:21.754 --> 09:22.987
rioting in the streets to protest

09:22.988 --> 09:24.188
the seizure of their artwork.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.308
MATT: Yeah, what do you expect?

09:25.309 --> 09:26.657
They break plates when they're happy.

09:26.658 --> 09:27.507
It's more than that.

09:27.508 --> 09:29.961
You can't put a price on the
Spartan Figures of Democracy.

09:29.962 --> 09:31.729
It would be like someone stealing

09:31.730 --> 09:33.231
the Declaration of Independence.

09:33.232 --> 09:35.166
Social media is totally behind Quinn.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.468
They're hailing him as a
modern-day Jesse James.

09:37.469 --> 09:40.505
The outlaw, not Sandra
Bullock's ex-husband.

09:40.506 --> 09:44.375
Hey, has anyone pointed out that
Sparta was not a democracy?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.978
I mean, it was a totally
militarized society.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.479
They were misnamed by
a British explorer,

09:48.480 --> 09:49.981
who originally stole
them from the Greeks

09:49.982 --> 09:51.182
back in the 19th century.

09:51.183 --> 09:53.184
They've had a hard life.

09:53.185 --> 09:55.887
They're like the foster
children of antiquities.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.455
And we want them to be happy.

09:57.456 --> 09:59.123
But right now, we need to focus

09:59.124 --> 10:01.592
on the economic summit in Brussels.

10:01.593 --> 10:03.528
I'd like to lay some guidelines.

10:03.529 --> 10:05.430
Oh, here we go.

10:05.431 --> 10:06.864
I beg your pardon?

10:06.865 --> 10:07.999
Hmm?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.901
Oh, I didn't realize
I said that out loud.

10:09.902 --> 10:10.835
(snorts)

10:10.836 --> 10:12.837
It's just that...

10:12.838 --> 10:15.206
you're always so...

10:15.207 --> 10:18.376
thorough... in prepping us

10:18.377 --> 10:21.245
about the pitfalls of fraternizing

10:21.246 --> 10:23.080
with the staffs of other countries.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.348
This trip is different.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.818
The summit has a reputation
for being a party conference.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.085
Everything is pre-negotiated.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.487
JAY: Which means some down time

10:29.488 --> 10:30.688
for us staffers!

10:30.689 --> 10:33.558
Hey, look, personally, I'd watch out

10:33.559 --> 10:34.926
for the Swedish delegation

10:34.927 --> 10:37.628
and their endless supply of aquavit.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.030
Actually, it was the Spaniards

10:39.031 --> 10:41.532
with their under-appreciated
regional wines and olive skin

10:41.533 --> 10:43.568
that had me hugging the porcelain.

10:43.569 --> 10:45.136
I'm quite serious about this.

10:45.137 --> 10:48.306
We've taken some very public blows lately.

10:48.307 --> 10:51.408
Just... behave yourselves.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.414
(door closes)

10:56.415 --> 10:58.382
Those statues were on their
way back to the Greeks,

10:58.383 --> 11:01.752
who so generously allowed
us to display them here.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.856
So you can see how embarrassing this is.

11:04.857 --> 11:08.626
Madam Secretary, do you know
what an economy runs on?

11:08.627 --> 11:09.727
Confidence.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.362
Really? I was gonna say money.

11:11.363 --> 11:13.965
When you issue a bond,
you're selling a promise.

11:13.966 --> 11:17.268
Break that promise, and
fear rules the market.

11:17.269 --> 11:19.170
I'm just holding the Greeks accountable.

11:19.171 --> 11:21.305
You're holding their prized
antiquities hostage.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.907
You can't possibly sell them.

11:22.908 --> 11:24.208
(laughs): Of course not.

11:24.209 --> 11:25.309
They're priceless.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.944
Well, then what do you want?

11:26.945 --> 11:28.880
What any reasonable investor wants.

11:28.881 --> 11:30.815
No, because all the other
reasonable investors

11:30.816 --> 11:32.016
are signing the debt deal.

11:32.017 --> 11:33.017
And they're welcome to.

11:33.018 --> 11:36.354
Me? I'm gonna get paid in full.

11:36.355 --> 11:38.422
Max, that is never gonna happen.

11:38.423 --> 11:40.458
You got to give me something
that I can work with.

11:40.459 --> 11:41.459
And send a message

11:41.460 --> 11:43.528
that corrupt, incompetent governments

11:43.529 --> 11:45.496
can spend their way into oblivion

11:45.497 --> 11:47.832
and count on us to pick up the pieces?

11:47.833 --> 11:48.833
Someone's got to say no.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.601
Even if it means a black eye

11:50.602 --> 11:52.670
for your country and your president?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.305
That's what I'm counting on.

11:54.306 --> 11:55.973
(dial tone)

11:55.974 --> 11:57.240
(hangs up phone)

12:00.279 --> 12:06.729
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

12:11.044 --> 12:12.579
(door opens)

12:12.580 --> 12:13.880
I hear you didn't get very far

12:13.881 --> 12:15.482
with the former treasury secretary.

12:15.483 --> 12:16.883
Russell, do come in.

12:16.884 --> 12:19.152
Let's put a lock on that door, Blake.

12:19.153 --> 12:20.120
Maybe a Marine guard.

12:20.121 --> 12:21.588
Yes, ma'am.

12:21.589 --> 12:23.556
Did you really think I
was gonna convince Quinn

12:23.557 --> 12:25.058
to give the statues back?

12:25.059 --> 12:26.159
A guy could hope.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.394
You're welcome to use the phone.

12:27.395 --> 12:29.029
Which works with me, too, by the way.

12:29.030 --> 12:29.996
I just left the Hill.

12:29.997 --> 12:31.297
I thought I'd make a pit stop.

12:31.298 --> 12:33.166
I wanted to let you know

12:33.167 --> 12:36.569
that I will not be making
the Brussels trip, so...

12:36.570 --> 12:38.438
make sure everything
goes according to plan.

12:38.439 --> 12:39.973
- No screw-ups.
- I'll do my best.

12:39.974 --> 12:41.374
After the Munsey scandal,

12:41.375 --> 12:44.644
people either think the
president was involved or weak

12:44.645 --> 12:46.279
not to have known something.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.515
The only thing we have
to rebuild his stature

12:48.516 --> 12:51.151
is the economy.

12:51.152 --> 12:52.819
So why aren't you going?

12:52.820 --> 12:54.854
'Cause somebody's got to
hit the talk show circuit

12:54.855 --> 12:56.956
about these damn statues.

12:56.957 --> 12:59.993
Clearly, I'm the one with
the most on-air personality.

12:59.994 --> 13:01.261
Yeah.

13:01.262 --> 13:04.297
You do have a kind of... stealthy charm.

13:04.298 --> 13:05.732
Yeah, well, let's hope so.

13:05.733 --> 13:08.134
Because it also turns out
there's a lot of cleanup

13:08.135 --> 13:09.602
after a failed coup.

13:09.603 --> 13:13.873
So I'll be Al Haig-ing it while
POTUS is victory-lapping.

13:13.874 --> 13:15.241
And you

13:15.242 --> 13:17.177
have to be flawless.

13:17.178 --> 13:18.278
Skate a clean program.

13:18.279 --> 13:20.380
I'm sharpening my blades.

13:20.381 --> 13:22.614
Tight turns.

13:28.621 --> 13:31.191
These are the four criteria
of the right to go to war,

13:31.192 --> 13:32.459
as outlined by the author

13:32.460 --> 13:36.129
of the just war theory
in Western tradition.

13:36.130 --> 13:39.632
Who was none other than...?

13:39.633 --> 13:41.534
Anybody? No one?

13:41.535 --> 13:42.469
Saint Augustine.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.003
- Come on.
- (students chuckle)

13:44.004 --> 13:45.705
I know it seems like a big contradiction

13:45.706 --> 13:48.675
for a holy man to take
on the issue of warfare

13:48.676 --> 13:51.845
in such a pragmatic way,
but most religious traditions

13:51.846 --> 13:53.713
address the matter in a similar fashion.

13:53.714 --> 13:55.247
There's only...

13:56.783 --> 13:59.018
...a handful of religious traditions

13:59.019 --> 14:01.087
that eschew the notion
of war altogether.

14:01.088 --> 14:03.356
Most take the position
that it's inevitable

14:03.357 --> 14:07.327
and therefore must
strive to be... moral.

14:07.328 --> 14:11.164
Or as my own military
ethics professor once said,

14:11.165 --> 14:14.200
"War is always wrong.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.703
"Always.

14:16.704 --> 14:18.404
But some things are wronger."

14:18.405 --> 14:19.806
(students chuckle)

14:19.807 --> 14:22.275
Okay, that's it for today. Thank you.

14:22.276 --> 14:24.677
Good-bye.

14:24.678 --> 14:26.946
(students talking quietly)

14:26.947 --> 14:28.014
Dr. McCord.

14:28.015 --> 14:29.549
Yes?

14:29.550 --> 14:31.684
Brigadier General Mitch Sarno.

14:31.685 --> 14:32.685
Great lecture.

14:32.686 --> 14:34.687
Well, you just saw the end of it.

14:34.688 --> 14:36.422
Uh, what can I do for you, General?

14:36.423 --> 14:38.224
I've been following your
military ethics courses

14:38.225 --> 14:39.626
since you were at UVA.

14:39.627 --> 14:42.729
We take an interest in
how the next generation

14:42.730 --> 14:45.265
is being instructed along those lines.

14:45.266 --> 14:46.599
"We"?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.434
I'm sorry, I thought you
might be aware of my work.

14:48.435 --> 14:49.602
I'm the commandant of

14:49.603 --> 14:51.838
the National War College here in D.C.

14:51.839 --> 14:54.240
Well, I'm flattered that
you're interested in me,

14:54.241 --> 14:55.808
and a little paranoid. (chuckles)

14:55.809 --> 14:57.677
It's a scouting mission.

14:57.678 --> 14:59.379
We think

14:59.380 --> 15:00.513
you'd fit nicely in

15:00.514 --> 15:03.616
our Strategic Studies department.

15:03.617 --> 15:04.918
You're offering me a job?

15:04.919 --> 15:07.787
You'd be a strong
addition to our faculty.

15:07.788 --> 15:10.523
Well, uh... that-that's
quite an honor, General,

15:10.524 --> 15:12.659
but, um, I'm happy with what I do here.

15:12.660 --> 15:14.627
Yes, it is rewarding,

15:14.628 --> 15:16.763
shaping the minds of
liberal arts students.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.698
But our students

15:18.699 --> 15:20.033
need to understand

15:20.034 --> 15:22.769
the beliefs and customs
of a potential enemy.

15:22.770 --> 15:25.772
You would be teaching all the future

15:25.773 --> 15:28.174
military and national security leaders.

15:28.175 --> 15:29.943
And working for the Defense Department.

15:29.944 --> 15:32.245
If you're worried about
a conflict of interest,

15:32.246 --> 15:33.913
we're not.

15:33.914 --> 15:37.115
It all falls under the
dome of national security.

15:39.919 --> 15:41.853
Give it some thought.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.363
Harrison...

15:50.364 --> 15:53.433
I've called twice and I've texted twice,

15:53.434 --> 15:55.068
because I really kicked

15:55.069 --> 15:57.337
the "I want to see you more" football.

15:57.338 --> 15:59.606
But now I am starting
to feel like an idiot.

15:59.607 --> 16:00.873
And a stalker.

16:00.874 --> 16:02.609
So I'm not gonna call you again.

16:02.610 --> 16:04.743
Ball's in your court.

16:05.445 --> 16:06.813
Let me guess.

16:06.814 --> 16:08.081
I'm an idiot.

16:08.082 --> 16:09.282
I'm telling you.

16:09.283 --> 16:10.984
It's a character defect. You can't engage.

16:10.985 --> 16:12.352
I have to try though.

16:12.353 --> 16:14.921
I mean, he... he's in a
really fragile state.

16:14.922 --> 16:17.657
He's just been through
a really, really hard time.

16:17.658 --> 16:18.858
Rehab?

16:18.859 --> 16:20.426
I didn't say that.

16:20.427 --> 16:21.594
You don't have to.

16:21.595 --> 16:23.963
The disappearing act is
classic addict behavior.

16:23.964 --> 16:25.031
People get better.

16:25.032 --> 16:26.833
Not by being enabled.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.568
Which is what you're doing
if you're chasing him around

16:28.569 --> 16:30.536
to hold his hand and
listen to his feelings.

16:30.537 --> 16:33.039
It's just... you don't
know what it's like

16:33.040 --> 16:36.641
to be in a family like his family.

16:37.377 --> 16:39.279
I know who his family is.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.014
I heard you say "Harrison".

16:41.015 --> 16:42.515
I have some deductive reasoning skills.

16:42.516 --> 16:43.916
Okay, well, please don't tell anybody.

16:43.917 --> 16:46.185
Everybody knows he's troubled.

16:46.186 --> 16:49.121
The press is gonna get ahold
of the rehab thing eventually.

16:49.889 --> 16:51.758
Hey.

16:51.759 --> 16:55.093
No matter what happens,
you're not responsible.

16:59.065 --> 17:00.800
Ow! Ow...

17:00.801 --> 17:02.335
- Ah, damn it!
- HENRY: Are you okay?

17:02.336 --> 17:03.703
- What just happened?
- Will you please

17:03.704 --> 17:05.738
sit on my suitcase while I close it?

17:05.739 --> 17:07.205
Will you say that again,

17:07.207 --> 17:09.541
- in a slow, sexy voice?
- Come on.

17:09.542 --> 17:12.044
Okay. Do you really need all
this stuff for a three-day trip?

17:12.045 --> 17:13.112
It's Europe.

17:13.113 --> 17:14.681
They're judgy.

17:14.682 --> 17:16.082
Hey, are you sure you're okay with this?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.483
It's the first time
you've been abroad since,

17:17.483 --> 17:19.452
- you know, all that...
- Yes, I am fine.

17:19.453 --> 17:22.755
Look, I've got my unopened
bottle of nerve pills,

17:22.756 --> 17:27.894
and I've got 15 hours of
whale songs on my iPad

17:27.895 --> 17:30.630
and a brown paper bag
that I can breathe into.

17:30.631 --> 17:31.764
Really,

17:31.765 --> 17:32.999
I am fine. I promise.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.667
And I've been doing that
meditation every day,

17:34.668 --> 17:36.002
which I know is working

17:36.003 --> 17:37.603
because of how much I hate it.

17:37.604 --> 17:38.871
- Well, good.
- Hey, listen.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.039
I know it goes without saying,

17:40.040 --> 17:42.075
but you are not going to accept that job

17:42.076 --> 17:43.810
without a full-on family meeting, right?

17:43.811 --> 17:45.878
I will go you one better.

17:45.879 --> 17:47.880
(sighs) I'm not going
to accept that job.

17:47.881 --> 17:50.717
What? You're... you're not
even gonna consider it?

17:50.718 --> 17:54.087
A religious scholar teaching
at the National War College?

17:54.088 --> 17:56.522
There's only so much cognitive
dissonance I can handle.

17:56.523 --> 17:57.690
Teaching military ethics,

17:57.691 --> 18:00.626
a subject that you happen
to be passionate about.

18:00.627 --> 18:02.128
Okay. I don't want to work

18:02.129 --> 18:03.529
for a competing
department of government.

18:03.530 --> 18:05.932
State and Defense don't compete.

18:05.933 --> 18:08.101
We compare and contrast expertise,

18:08.102 --> 18:11.437
often in an openly hostile manner.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.440
Babe, I am happy where I am, really.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.275
W-Wait, what is this?

18:16.276 --> 18:18.044
What is this?

18:18.045 --> 18:20.146
GEORGIOU: ...a series of insults

18:20.147 --> 18:22.348
from foreign governments,

18:22.349 --> 18:25.585
- and the loss of a national treasure,
- (phone vibrating)

18:25.586 --> 18:27.587
we must reject

18:27.588 --> 18:30.189
the negotiated debt deal in Brussels.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.624
(phone continues vibrating)

18:31.625 --> 18:33.326
That can't be good.

18:33.327 --> 18:35.561
Hey, Russell.

18:35.562 --> 18:36.829
Yeah.

18:36.830 --> 18:38.431
I'm finding out the same way you are.

18:38.432 --> 18:40.299
I'll get into it.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.935
(sighs)

18:42.936 --> 18:44.537
So...

18:44.538 --> 18:46.606
unless we can convince Greece

18:46.607 --> 18:50.243
to make a new deal, and fast,
they're gonna default.

18:50.244 --> 18:53.311
Leading to global economic collapse.

18:54.847 --> 18:57.617
We are not finished talking
about your job offer.

18:57.618 --> 18:59.452
Why don't you concentrate

18:59.453 --> 19:01.554
on making sure our 401(k)s and house

19:01.555 --> 19:03.555
aren't worthless by tomorrow morning?

19:05.000 --> 19:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:35.154 --> 19:38.257
Seems our victory lap has
turned into a funeral march.

19:38.258 --> 19:41.126
There is a definite chill in the air.

19:42.862 --> 19:44.997
And here comes the German chancellor.

19:44.998 --> 19:47.333
Even at her most chipper,
she can freeze fire.

19:47.334 --> 19:50.336
Chancellor Schulz. Glad to see you.

19:50.337 --> 19:54.073
I had hoped our circumstances
would be more celebratory.

19:54.074 --> 19:55.875
Yes.

19:55.876 --> 19:57.577
It is my understanding

19:57.578 --> 20:00.046
that the man responsible
for this catastrophe

20:00.047 --> 20:02.114
is a cabinet member of your choosing,

20:02.115 --> 20:03.549
Mr. President.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.185
Max Quinn is a former
cabinet member, Chancellor.

20:06.186 --> 20:08.988
But appointed by your
president, Madam Secretary.

20:08.989 --> 20:10.389
You are absolutely correct.

20:10.390 --> 20:13.993
But the true catastrophe began
with our friends, the Greeks.

20:13.994 --> 20:16.128
Why don't we concentrate
on getting them back on board

20:16.129 --> 20:18.598
with the debt deal that we
all worked so hard for?

20:18.599 --> 20:19.966
The Greeks have made it clear

20:19.967 --> 20:22.068
that without their prized antiquities,

20:22.069 --> 20:23.936
they have no interest.

20:23.937 --> 20:27.340
I can assure you that Secretary
McCord is working on a solution.

20:27.341 --> 20:29.642
We all know that without
a sound financial plan,

20:29.643 --> 20:31.077
everyone's economy is in peril.

20:31.078 --> 20:32.411
And that is why the Greeks

20:32.412 --> 20:35.047
must get their precious statues
as quickly as possible.

20:35.048 --> 20:36.215
Perhaps if you and I can get

20:36.216 --> 20:37.650
Prime Minister Georgiou to meet with...

20:37.651 --> 20:39.352
Frankly, Mr. President,

20:39.353 --> 20:43.556
Europe is no longer
interested in American help.

20:43.557 --> 20:46.259
We must solve this on our own.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.093
Please excuse me.

20:52.031 --> 20:54.500
Did she just dis-invite us to the party?

20:54.501 --> 20:56.135
Tell me you're on this, Bess.

20:56.136 --> 20:58.403
I am on this, sir.

21:06.483 --> 21:08.659
NADINE: <i>That's not just
Georgiou making a stand</i>

21:08.660 --> 21:10.527
because Quinn took their statues.

21:10.528 --> 21:12.600
Everyone is mad at us
because of this debacle.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.335
The Greeks are leading
the world to the edge

21:14.336 --> 21:16.070
of financial collapse, and
the United States is blamed?

21:16.071 --> 21:17.371
MATT: That's why the French never

21:17.372 --> 21:19.407
texted me back about their party.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.675
Seriously?

21:20.676 --> 21:23.177
That guidelines discussion
just never lands, does it?

21:23.178 --> 21:24.478
It's a friendship summit.

21:24.479 --> 21:26.480
Camaraderie is diplomacy.

21:26.481 --> 21:28.215
I just got off the phone
with the attorney general.

21:28.216 --> 21:29.784
She's filing an emergency stay

21:29.785 --> 21:31.152
with the D.C. Court of Appeals,

21:31.153 --> 21:32.687
but we won't get a ruling until Monday.

21:32.688 --> 21:33.654
At which point...

21:33.655 --> 21:35.423
Greece will already be in default.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.458
I need a quick fix... something, anyone.

21:37.459 --> 21:38.993
JAY: I've been back
channeling with the IMF.

21:38.994 --> 21:40.294
Seeing if they're willing to make

21:40.295 --> 21:42.263
an emergency loan to buy
the Greeks more time.

21:42.264 --> 21:43.531
All right. Stay on them.

21:43.532 --> 21:45.132
In the meantime, ask the
European Central Bank

21:45.133 --> 21:47.301
if they'll look into another
bond restructuring.

21:47.302 --> 21:50.037
What else? I need something on Quinn.

21:50.038 --> 21:51.372
Something I can use for leverage.

21:51.373 --> 21:53.507
Payroll taxes, IRS.

21:53.508 --> 21:54.642
The man can't be squeaky clean.

21:54.643 --> 21:56.344
And the judge who
issued the court order.

21:56.345 --> 21:57.745
That couldn't have been the most

21:57.746 --> 21:58.713
pristine legal process.

21:58.714 --> 22:00.147
NADINE: My concern, ma'am,

22:00.148 --> 22:01.515
is that investigations take time,

22:01.516 --> 22:03.150
and this summit is over in two days.

22:03.151 --> 22:04.452
Noted.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.187
But we have to at least try.

22:06.188 --> 22:07.822
So, dig in.

22:07.823 --> 22:09.223
Blake, walk with me.

22:09.224 --> 22:11.758
I have something I need you to do.

22:15.062 --> 22:16.464
Prime Minster Georgiou, I assure you,

22:16.465 --> 22:18.566
we are doing everything we can

22:18.567 --> 22:20.501
to get you your statues back.

22:20.502 --> 22:23.771
But the best thing you can do
for your people and the world

22:23.772 --> 22:24.772
is to accept this agreement.

22:24.773 --> 22:26.507
Let's sign it, and get your country

22:26.508 --> 22:28.509
back on firm financial footing.

22:28.510 --> 22:32.012
So, we loan you national treasure,

22:32.013 --> 22:35.116
and in return, we suffer no less

22:35.117 --> 22:38.419
than an act of piracy on your land.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.287
DALTON: You have my word,

22:40.288 --> 22:41.889
your antiquities will be returned to you.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.991
But it will take time.

22:43.992 --> 22:46.127
The world economy is on
a precipice right now.

22:46.128 --> 22:49.997
We're asking you to think
of the lives of your people.

22:49.998 --> 22:52.366
I am! As prime minister,

22:52.367 --> 22:55.403
I have to make this stand
for the sake of my people.

22:55.404 --> 22:58.372
National pride... (chuckles)

22:58.373 --> 22:59.940
is at an all-time low.

22:59.941 --> 23:03.210
And how will economic collapse
affect national pride?

23:03.211 --> 23:04.478
What's your endgame?

23:04.479 --> 23:07.782
Spiros, sometimes we have to
bear the brunt of criticism

23:07.783 --> 23:10.718
for a more profitable
and enduring outcome.

23:10.719 --> 23:13.254
Please, don't... lecture me, Conrad.

23:13.255 --> 23:17.091
Maybe if you had listened
to your citizens,

23:17.092 --> 23:19.527
your own party would not be asking you

23:19.528 --> 23:21.362
to withdraw from the next election.

23:21.363 --> 23:24.365
The Iran debacle, the
corruption of your CIA...

23:24.366 --> 23:27.968
your credibility was the real casualty.

23:27.969 --> 23:33.007
If you actually cared
about the world economy,

23:33.008 --> 23:35.441
you wouldn't wait until the election.

23:37.244 --> 23:40.414
You would resign now.

23:40.415 --> 23:43.082
We have nothing more to discuss.

23:51.292 --> 23:53.060
Ooh, the cauliflower looks good.

23:53.061 --> 23:54.261
And the beets.

23:54.262 --> 23:56.764
And I'm-I'm totally
down with the escarole.

23:56.765 --> 23:58.432
You don't have to do this.

23:58.433 --> 23:59.767
You should order whatever you want.

23:59.768 --> 24:01.769
No, it's okay. I'm an aspiring vegan.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.204
Well, I'm getting tired of it.

24:03.205 --> 24:04.472
You want to let eggs back in?

24:04.473 --> 24:06.774
No, I want to let bacon burgers back in.

24:06.775 --> 24:07.975
Yeah, you'll get over it.

24:07.976 --> 24:09.777
No, I'm dreaming about them.

24:09.778 --> 24:11.312
Is that why I keep waking up

24:11.313 --> 24:13.414
with my head between two pillows?

24:13.415 --> 24:14.582
Whoa, sorry...

24:14.583 --> 24:17.084
Excuse me, uh, could you
turn that up, please?

24:17.085 --> 24:19.854
...House officials are reporting
that an ambulance was called

24:19.855 --> 24:22.723
by someone in the White House
for a member of the staff.

24:22.724 --> 24:25.693
We're told it was a
non-life-threatening emergency.

24:25.694 --> 24:28.095
And, of course, the president
is out of the country,

24:28.096 --> 24:30.431
attending an economic
summit in Brussels.

24:30.432 --> 24:31.999
Okay, that scares me.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.967
Harrison?

24:32.968 --> 24:34.401
Yeah, I haven't heard from him.

24:34.402 --> 24:36.235
They said a member of the staff.

24:36.937 --> 24:40.007
I know... (sighs)

24:40.008 --> 24:42.276
IMF and the Central European Bank

24:42.277 --> 24:44.545
are reviewing our petitions,
but no love, so far.

24:44.546 --> 24:46.947
Also, I tried to get the Germans
to sweeten the deal for Greece,

24:46.948 --> 24:48.215
but they're not budging.

24:48.216 --> 24:50.316
They're punishing them for walking out.

24:51.285 --> 24:53.220
Where's Blake?

24:53.221 --> 24:54.989
Oh, I saw him in the
lobby two hours ago,

24:54.990 --> 24:56.023
talking to some staffers.

24:56.024 --> 24:56.991
Not our people.

24:56.992 --> 24:58.659
I didn't take him for a partier.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.594
He's probably in the gym,
cycling to Sondheim.

25:00.595 --> 25:01.862
I'm gonna go find him.

25:01.863 --> 25:03.597
Nobody leaves this room.

25:03.598 --> 25:05.099
The secretary is counting on us.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.771
We will not let her down.

25:06.883 --> 25:09.303
ELIZABETH: I've been talking
to the French and Brits.

25:09.304 --> 25:10.571
If we can't get the statues,

25:10.572 --> 25:12.540
I think that we can tempt
Prime Minister Georgiou

25:12.541 --> 25:13.841
with a better debt deal.

25:13.842 --> 25:16.443
Fine.

25:16.444 --> 25:20.214
Look, I've heard about
the rumblings in the party.

25:20.215 --> 25:23.284
But did somebody really ask you
not to run for a second term?

25:23.285 --> 25:25.819
My top bundlers are
pulling their support.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.588
When the money dries up,

25:27.589 --> 25:30.090
the party looks for someone
to throw overboard.

25:30.091 --> 25:32.293
Well, we won't listen to them.

25:32.294 --> 25:34.762
Part of doing the job is knowing
when you're not doing it.

25:34.763 --> 25:36.502
Whatever happens though,
you'll keep your post.

25:36.503 --> 25:37.865
They need you, and they know it.

25:37.866 --> 25:40.000
I never wanted to be Secretary of State.

25:40.001 --> 25:41.335
I'm here because of you.

25:41.336 --> 25:42.970
Well, you should rethink your position.

25:42.971 --> 25:44.405
What is going on?

25:44.406 --> 25:47.107
Conrad, we have been in much
tougher spots than this before.

25:47.108 --> 25:48.142
Kosovo?

25:48.143 --> 25:49.877
For God sakes, 9/11?

25:49.878 --> 25:51.245
Why won't you fight?

25:51.246 --> 25:52.713
Germany thinks it can
fix the world economy

25:52.714 --> 25:53.814
without America's help?

25:53.815 --> 25:55.849
Fine. Maybe they can.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.319
Can you just... sit down and talk to me?

25:58.320 --> 26:02.089
I came here to give the world a visual

26:02.090 --> 26:04.792
of the United States
solving the debt crisis.

26:04.793 --> 26:07.695
Instead, I'm shut out
of the entire discussion,

26:07.696 --> 26:11.332
and I'm expected to apologize
for creating a catastrophe!

26:11.333 --> 26:12.800
It's just a setback.

26:12.801 --> 26:13.901
We can still fix this.

26:13.902 --> 26:15.502
And you can still have that moment.

26:15.503 --> 26:17.236
I don't believe you.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.043
(slurring): ♪ Rather
laugh with the sinners ♪

26:23.044 --> 26:24.545
♪ Than cry with the saints ♪

26:24.546 --> 26:27.348
♪ The sinners are much more fun ♪

26:27.349 --> 26:31.151

26:31.152 --> 26:32.186
(laughter)

26:32.187 --> 26:33.120
You sound great!

26:33.121 --> 26:34.822
That sounds great, even in German!

26:34.823 --> 26:36.490
Wait, wait, wait, where's a bathroom?

26:36.491 --> 26:38.025
No, I need a bathroom. Uh, uh...

26:38.026 --> 26:39.693
(speaking German)

26:39.694 --> 26:41.261
(laughter)

26:41.262 --> 26:43.263
(all shouting,
laughing drunkenly)

26:43.264 --> 26:45.466
(group clamoring)

26:45.467 --> 26:48.068
Hi!

26:48.069 --> 26:49.336
(shouting in German)

26:49.337 --> 26:51.372
Yeah. I have no clue what you're saying.

26:51.373 --> 26:52.339
All right.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.440
Oh, my God.

26:55.776 --> 26:57.977
(knocks) Hello? Please hurry.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.980
No!

27:02.016 --> 27:03.851
Oh... no wonder you guys have

27:03.852 --> 27:05.519
such a good welfare system.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.421
All right.

27:07.422 --> 27:10.858
Oh...

27:10.859 --> 27:13.527
Really? You're gonna be picky
about which coins work?

27:13.528 --> 27:15.262
Oh!

27:15.263 --> 27:16.829
Damn.

27:22.369 --> 27:24.071
All right, all right.

27:24.072 --> 27:25.372
All right.

27:25.373 --> 27:28.575
Can't put a price on this.

27:28.576 --> 27:30.376
(sighs)

27:34.515 --> 27:36.749
(siren wailing)

27:49.295 --> 27:51.302
Germany is holding firm,
so we are stalled

27:51.303 --> 27:52.536
on a revised debt deal.

27:52.537 --> 27:54.491
Then we need Greece
back at the bargaining table.

27:54.492 --> 27:55.564
Which means Quinn has to

27:55.565 --> 27:57.396
- return those statues.
- Exactly.

28:00.834 --> 28:02.235
I mean, this is that moment

28:02.236 --> 28:05.031
when you guys jump in with
your awesome new ideas

28:05.032 --> 28:06.234
on how we're gonna achieve that.

28:06.235 --> 28:07.874
Ma'am, we <i>really</i> dug around.

28:07.875 --> 28:11.077
I called a friend at Treasury,
hoping for a skeleton or two.

28:11.078 --> 28:13.747
Nobody likes Quinn, but there's
nothing illegal about that.

28:13.748 --> 28:14.881
I checked with the IRS.

28:14.882 --> 28:16.883
A forensic accountant
might find something,

28:16.884 --> 28:18.251
but that'll take weeks.

28:18.252 --> 28:19.920
Greece has a major payment due tomorrow.

28:19.921 --> 28:22.355
We need something... some solution now.

28:22.356 --> 28:23.790
JAY: The big banks can cover their losses

28:23.791 --> 28:25.625
for two, maybe three days tops,

28:25.626 --> 28:30.263
but after that, we're looking at
a very bad game of dominoes.

28:30.264 --> 28:31.531
Portugal defaults.

28:31.532 --> 28:32.632
Then Spain.

28:32.633 --> 28:35.468
The Euro collapses,
exports grind to a halt,

28:35.469 --> 28:38.772
and then... your basic
global depression.

28:38.773 --> 28:41.408
All for a trio of disappointing statues.

28:41.409 --> 28:42.874
I'd hardly call them disappointing.

28:42.875 --> 28:43.510
Trust me.

28:43.511 --> 28:44.778
My girlfriend and I had to book

28:44.779 --> 28:46.313
a year in advance just to see them.

28:46.314 --> 28:47.314
Aesthetically?

28:47.315 --> 28:48.248
Not much.

28:48.249 --> 28:49.482
- A year in advance?
- Yeah.

28:49.483 --> 28:50.984
And it was elbow-to-elbow
once we got there.

28:50.985 --> 28:52.585
That's a lot of people.

28:52.586 --> 28:56.423
And I would imagine that
the division of profits

28:56.424 --> 28:59.359
would probably be pre-negotiated
by the lending nation.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.794
Like a mid-level rock band.

29:00.795 --> 29:02.762
They only make money
when they're on the road.

29:02.763 --> 29:04.898
(grunts softly)

29:04.899 --> 29:06.299
(phone vibrating)

29:06.300 --> 29:07.600
Blake!

29:07.601 --> 29:09.235
Blake's indisposed at the moment.

29:09.236 --> 29:10.637
"Indisposed" mean he's in the bathroom?

29:10.638 --> 29:13.472
Not really, but that
would've been a good idea.

29:14.641 --> 29:17.110
Hey, Stevie.

29:17.111 --> 29:19.212
Hi. How are things in Brussels?

29:19.213 --> 29:21.815
Well, they're coming along.

29:21.816 --> 29:22.916
Everything good there?

29:22.917 --> 29:23.917
Yeah. Totally.

29:23.918 --> 29:26.019
Totally not convinced.

29:26.020 --> 29:30.056
Okay, I know that President
Dalton is there. Um...

29:30.057 --> 29:31.624
I was just wondering

29:31.625 --> 29:33.026
how he seems to you.

29:33.027 --> 29:35.095
Uh, he seems stressed.

29:35.096 --> 29:36.262
Which is appropriate.

29:36.263 --> 29:37.430
Because of the debt crisis?

29:37.431 --> 29:39.532
Of course. Why?

29:39.533 --> 29:43.203
(sighs) It's just that I saw
Harrison the other day.

29:43.204 --> 29:45.839
He called me out of the blue
and wanted to have lunch,

29:45.840 --> 29:47.841
and we hung out, and it was fun,

29:47.842 --> 29:50.076
and then, you know, we
agreed to keep hanging out,

29:50.077 --> 29:52.045
but he hasn't been answering
my texts since then.

29:52.046 --> 29:53.513
Isn't he always like that?

29:53.514 --> 29:54.647
Yeah, but...

29:54.648 --> 29:56.483
I think he's kind of in trouble again.

29:56.484 --> 29:57.550
Really?

29:57.551 --> 29:59.252
Yeah, and then I saw
this thing on the news

29:59.253 --> 30:02.255
about an ambulance going
to the White House, and...

30:02.256 --> 30:03.456
I was worried.

30:03.457 --> 30:05.759
I was just wondering if Mr. Dalton

30:05.760 --> 30:07.260
has said anything to you.

30:07.261 --> 30:09.529
Um, no, he hasn't.

30:09.530 --> 30:10.764
Okay, well...

30:10.765 --> 30:13.165
I'm sure I'm just worrying for nothing.

30:15.368 --> 30:16.770
Mom?

30:16.771 --> 30:17.737
Yeah, I'm here.

30:17.738 --> 30:19.906
How are you?

30:19.907 --> 30:22.142
I mean... with everything else.

30:22.143 --> 30:24.477
Tell your father I'm fine.

30:24.478 --> 30:25.612
Hey, I really do care, too.

30:25.613 --> 30:27.781
And I really am fine.

30:27.782 --> 30:28.882
Listen, I'm glad

30:28.883 --> 30:30.717
that you're friends with Harrison again.

30:30.718 --> 30:32.851
If I am.

30:37.390 --> 30:39.492
I can smell you from here.

30:39.493 --> 30:41.127
Yeah.

30:41.128 --> 30:42.128
Imagine how I feel.

30:42.129 --> 30:43.463
What were you thinking?

30:43.464 --> 30:46.166
You are the last person I
would've expected this from.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.268
I'm sorry. My coins were too big.

30:48.269 --> 30:50.370
What is that, some sort of euphemism?

30:50.371 --> 30:52.605
No. They were pay toilets.

30:52.606 --> 30:54.074
Who has pay toilets anymore?

30:54.075 --> 30:56.476
Stop. Stop. Enough excuses.

30:56.477 --> 30:58.111
As far as I'm concerned,

30:58.112 --> 31:01.181
you are an embarrassment to
the entire State Department.

31:01.182 --> 31:04.317
We will speak again
after you have bathed.

31:04.318 --> 31:06.718
And burned your clothing.

31:10.924 --> 31:12.759
You're really leaving?

31:12.760 --> 31:15.061
What can I do for you, Elizabeth?

31:15.062 --> 31:17.263
Um...

31:17.264 --> 31:19.531
Could I get a minute, sir?

31:22.268 --> 31:24.069
Excuse us, gentlemen.

31:28.108 --> 31:30.443
I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.

31:30.444 --> 31:32.078
I've known you a long time.

31:32.079 --> 31:34.781
Only one thing gets you
this out of sorts.

31:34.782 --> 31:36.381
It's Harrison, isn't it?

31:38.051 --> 31:40.587
I wanted him to have
some time to recover

31:40.588 --> 31:42.021
before it's out in the press.

31:42.022 --> 31:43.523
It's not out.

31:43.524 --> 31:44.891
Stevie called me.

31:44.892 --> 31:46.126
They've been talking.

31:46.127 --> 31:47.793
Huh.

31:49.496 --> 31:51.798
Four days out of rehab.

31:51.799 --> 31:53.833
Lydia found him passed out in his room.

31:53.834 --> 31:56.269
Heroin. Again.

31:56.270 --> 31:58.238
Not an overdose, just a scare.

31:58.239 --> 32:00.140
But it's back to square one.

32:00.141 --> 32:02.975
Matter of time before
it's all over the news.

32:04.677 --> 32:07.113
Oh, poor kid.

32:07.114 --> 32:09.215
He didn't ask for this life.

32:09.216 --> 32:12.218
My heart goes out to him.

32:12.219 --> 32:14.820
And to you, Conrad.

32:16.589 --> 32:17.857
But Harrison's an adult now.

32:17.858 --> 32:21.628
He's in the care of people
who know how to treat him.

32:21.629 --> 32:23.963
Let them do their jobs.

32:23.964 --> 32:26.132
Let him do his.

32:26.133 --> 32:29.401
And now you do yours.

32:31.938 --> 32:34.941
September 12, you came into the office,

32:34.942 --> 32:36.943
gathered everybody around, and told us

32:36.944 --> 32:39.212
that you understood
what we were feeling.

32:39.213 --> 32:41.181
Frightened, helpless.

32:41.182 --> 32:43.850
Guilty, sad.

32:43.851 --> 32:46.052
But you told us that we had to be strong

32:46.053 --> 32:47.187
for those people who couldn't be.

32:47.188 --> 32:48.321
And then you said that

32:48.322 --> 32:49.989
anybody who wasn't up
to that could leave,

32:49.990 --> 32:51.724
no questions asked, no shame.

32:51.725 --> 32:53.226
Do you remember who left?

32:53.227 --> 32:54.561
(chuckles softly)

32:54.562 --> 32:55.962
No one.

32:55.963 --> 32:57.362
Because of you.

32:59.666 --> 33:01.668
That was a long time ago, Bess.

33:01.669 --> 33:03.369
Conrad!

33:03.370 --> 33:06.339
We can fix this.

33:06.340 --> 33:08.607
We have to at least try.

33:17.536 --> 33:19.071
Hi, Russell. Is everything okay?

33:19.072 --> 33:20.173
As far as I know.

33:20.174 --> 33:22.575
That's not what I'm here about.

33:22.576 --> 33:24.877
Come on in.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.913
That, uh...

33:26.914 --> 33:30.049
job offer from the War College, Henry...

33:30.050 --> 33:31.517
it really wasn't a question.

33:31.518 --> 33:33.019
It came from your office.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.788
From me, to be exact.

33:35.789 --> 33:38.925
You're a top religious scholar
with a military background

33:38.926 --> 33:41.460
who happens to have the
highest security clearance.

33:41.461 --> 33:42.895
It's tailor-made for you.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.063
So what are you waiting for?

33:44.064 --> 33:45.531
I like the job that I have.

33:45.532 --> 33:48.534
(scoffs) You could be
teaching your ethics class

33:48.535 --> 33:50.835
to a group of future military leaders.

33:52.038 --> 33:55.041
NSA work you did... you were good at it.

33:55.042 --> 33:58.010
You can't tell me you don't miss it.

33:58.011 --> 34:01.546
Is the teaching position a
cover for intelligence work?

34:02.315 --> 34:05.618
It would be a real job,

34:05.619 --> 34:09.789
but I can't say what may or
may not come up around it.

34:09.790 --> 34:12.992
I can say it would be public service.

34:12.993 --> 34:14.927
Isn't that the life
you're living already?

34:14.928 --> 34:17.029
Well, I'm not gonna answer
to the Defense Department.

34:17.030 --> 34:19.197
If you know my work,
you know that I've been

34:19.199 --> 34:20.967
an outspoken critic of
many of their policies.

34:20.967 --> 34:22.501
All the more reason to be there.

34:22.502 --> 34:25.137
Add a voice of reason.

34:25.138 --> 34:27.139
Help the policy makers understand

34:27.139 --> 34:30.942
Augustine's principles of just war.

34:32.311 --> 34:33.911
I'll think about it.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.750
Elizabeth will be fine with it.

34:37.751 --> 34:39.418
(chuckles)

34:39.418 --> 34:41.020
Tell me something, Russell.

34:41.021 --> 34:44.621
Does this menacing midnight
ride thing actually work?

34:50.196 --> 34:52.330
On most people.

34:55.568 --> 34:57.470
ELIZABETH: Max, your
statues are gonna go

34:57.471 --> 34:58.804
back on the road.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.907
Like a mid-level rock band.

35:00.908 --> 35:02.575
It's the only way they make money.

35:02.576 --> 35:03.876
(scoffs) What?

35:03.877 --> 35:06.178
Those guys make a fortune
in corporate sponsorship.

35:06.179 --> 35:07.847
They got clothing lines and perfumes.

35:07.848 --> 35:10.650
Well, that was someone else's analogy.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.251
But the economics are the same.

35:12.252 --> 35:13.986
You'll return the Spartan figures

35:13.987 --> 35:15.388
to the Smithsonian tomorrow,

35:15.389 --> 35:17.990
where they will begin a new
exhibition and world tour.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.892
From the Greeks' perspective,
they're still on loan.

35:19.893 --> 35:23.696
But you will get all the profits
until that debt is paid in full.

35:23.697 --> 35:25.631
But that'll take a century.

35:25.632 --> 35:27.466
And a half. But what do you care?

35:27.467 --> 35:29.435
You're all about the principle.

35:29.436 --> 35:31.871
Action is taken, confidence is restored.

35:31.872 --> 35:34.774
The economy runs on
confidence, I'm told.

35:34.775 --> 35:36.142
And money.

35:36.143 --> 35:39.478
This is a fix the Greeks can live with.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.681
And I've got to think
that your shareholders

35:41.682 --> 35:44.216
would prefer it to being hostage takers?

35:44.217 --> 35:45.785
They'll grumble,

35:45.786 --> 35:48.287
but they were getting a little
antsy about global depression.

35:48.288 --> 35:50.523
Then we have a deal?

35:50.524 --> 35:52.891
A bad one, but yes.

35:54.293 --> 35:55.261
Thank you.

35:55.262 --> 35:56.896
We'll, uh... speak soon.

35:56.897 --> 36:00.800
Ooh! (grunts) I love it when
we avoid financial Armageddon.

36:00.801 --> 36:03.836
Yeah, I don't want to
bring down the mood.

36:03.837 --> 36:05.137
One small problem.

36:05.138 --> 36:08.474
I can't reach any of the
European leaders or their staff.

36:08.475 --> 36:11.010
For all we know, they
may have gone home.

36:11.011 --> 36:12.745
Madam Secretary.

36:12.746 --> 36:13.779
Blake.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.581
Talk to me.

36:15.582 --> 36:17.316
It seems the Germans are
having a secret meeting

36:17.317 --> 36:19.018
with the other European heads of state,

36:19.019 --> 36:22.720
leaving the Americans <i>sie</i>
<i>frieren sich dich schwaenze ab.</i>

36:23.789 --> 36:25.891
I can also say, "Another
round of Schnapps."

36:25.892 --> 36:27.159
Blake was on a fact-finding mission

36:27.160 --> 36:28.828
for me last night.

36:28.829 --> 36:31.263
Although the public
urination was his idea.

36:31.264 --> 36:33.065
Nature calls the same in any language.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.767
Wait, so you were talking
to her the whole time?

36:34.768 --> 36:36.635
Except for the part
where I was in a lockup

36:36.636 --> 36:38.270
with a skinhead and a mime.

36:38.271 --> 36:40.973
Ma'am, these tradecraft
episodes would work even better

36:40.974 --> 36:43.242
if you would fill us all in.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.311
Well, that's actually the
opposite of how they work.

36:45.312 --> 36:46.946
When is this meeting?

36:46.947 --> 36:48.647
(phone chimes)

36:48.648 --> 36:50.582
Funny you should ask. Right now.

36:54.186 --> 36:56.789
Mr. President, Germany
is cutting us out.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.758
They're having a secret
meeting to kill the deal.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.092
Where?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.894
Right here, third floor, Petite Ballroom.

37:03.629 --> 37:05.097
Change of plan.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.699
The secretary and I have
a meeting to crash.

37:15.341 --> 37:17.343
Move away from the door.

37:17.344 --> 37:18.810
Now.

37:21.213 --> 37:22.914
Should we knock?

37:25.151 --> 37:26.852
Excuse me, Mr. President!

37:26.853 --> 37:28.687
Sorry we're late.

37:28.688 --> 37:30.322
Sir,

37:30.323 --> 37:34.360
you and your secretary of state
are not part of this meeting.

37:34.361 --> 37:36.094
We are now.

37:36.829 --> 37:39.865
What I mean is you're not welcome.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.367
Oh, we'll get over it.

37:41.368 --> 37:44.036
Our minds are firmly made up.

37:44.037 --> 37:45.738
No more deals.

37:45.739 --> 37:48.741
The Greeks must be punished
for their recent behavior.

37:48.742 --> 37:51.510
We are considering kicking
them out of the eurozone.

37:51.511 --> 37:52.978
This is not the moment to retreat.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.648
Mr. President, we are
not going to sit here

37:55.649 --> 37:57.917
and listen to you argue
for your own interests.

37:57.918 --> 38:00.553
After recent events,

38:00.554 --> 38:03.989
you don't have enough authority
to hold anyone's attention.

38:03.990 --> 38:07.760
I'm glad you brought that
up, Chancellor Schulz.

38:07.761 --> 38:09.995
Your attention.

38:09.996 --> 38:13.365
Or, uh, your attention
spans, more specifically.

38:13.366 --> 38:16.068
Are your memories really that short?

38:16.069 --> 38:18.737
I look around this room, and
I don't see a single nation,

38:18.738 --> 38:20.873
large or small,

38:20.874 --> 38:22.241
that is immune to misfortune.

38:22.242 --> 38:23.876
Ireland.

38:23.877 --> 38:25.077
Three years ago,

38:25.078 --> 38:28.447
your bonds were junk and
needed a bailout to survive.

38:28.448 --> 38:30.015
Spain.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.985
Your unemployment rate is at 26%.

38:32.986 --> 38:35.554
An entire generation is leaving home.

38:35.555 --> 38:36.889
Portugal.

38:36.890 --> 38:38.858
Yesterday,

38:38.859 --> 38:41.460
your debt was 129% of GDP.

38:41.461 --> 38:44.463
Do you really want to face
the music by yourself?

38:44.464 --> 38:46.531
Chancellor, you're shaking your head.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.034
But this is not a morality play.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.003
The very future of your
citizens is at stake.

38:52.738 --> 38:55.040
We can stand together,

38:55.041 --> 38:58.611
as we did at the end of
the Second World War,

38:58.612 --> 39:00.878
or we can wither alone.

39:02.281 --> 39:05.584
Now, anyone who wants to leave,

39:05.585 --> 39:07.585
there's the door.

39:08.487 --> 39:11.556
(quiet murmuring)

39:12.591 --> 39:14.160
Good.

39:14.161 --> 39:17.395
I think it's time we all
got down to business.

39:25.137 --> 39:27.106
Hi.

39:27.107 --> 39:28.674
Hi.

39:28.675 --> 39:30.009
(chuckles)

39:30.010 --> 39:31.810
How you doing?

39:31.811 --> 39:33.812
Uh, you're looking at it.

39:33.813 --> 39:35.481
Sorry I didn't call.

39:35.482 --> 39:37.016
I'm kind of a lousy friend.

39:37.017 --> 39:38.284
Stop. It's fine.

39:38.285 --> 39:39.585
No, it's not.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.819
I'm...

39:40.820 --> 39:43.122
I wish I could tell you that
I was gonna get better,

39:43.123 --> 39:44.790
but I don't... I don't know.

39:44.791 --> 39:47.860
I'm probably gonna be a
mess for a little while.

39:47.861 --> 39:50.496
Hopefully a sober one.

39:50.497 --> 39:52.464
But, uh, I don't know.

39:52.465 --> 39:54.466
It's the pressure to act
like a normal person,

39:54.467 --> 39:57.469
it makes me feel, like, caged in,

39:57.470 --> 40:00.905
so I-I'm, um... not gonna do that.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.609
Look, Harry.

40:06.245 --> 40:08.314
I'm the secretary of state's daughter,

40:08.315 --> 40:10.683
and I flamed out of college,

40:10.684 --> 40:12.952
I maxed out all of my
mother's credit cards,

40:12.953 --> 40:16.889
and then I had to move
back in with my parents.

40:16.890 --> 40:19.525
I think we can find some common ground.

40:19.526 --> 40:22.228
I still win.

40:22.229 --> 40:23.996
You were always so competitive.

40:23.997 --> 40:26.564
(both laugh)

40:27.333 --> 40:28.968
Oh, hey.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.736
Sorry, I didn't hear the trumpets.

40:30.737 --> 40:32.238
I got rid of those.

40:32.239 --> 40:33.239
Too distracting.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.340
Hi, Mr. Dalton.

40:34.341 --> 40:35.975
Hi, Stevie.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.309
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.711
Heard things went well in Brussels,

40:38.712 --> 40:40.379
so you're back on top.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.948
For the moment.

40:42.949 --> 40:45.083
Um, well, I should get going.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.820
I'll call you.

40:58.063 --> 41:00.065
The house looks amazing.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.034
Now everything's working.

41:02.035 --> 41:04.503
How'd you get water pressure
up to the second floor?

41:04.504 --> 41:06.171
Mad skills.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.506
Called a plumber.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.141
(both laugh)

41:09.142 --> 41:11.176
You know, I've been thinking...

41:11.177 --> 41:12.878
You're gonna take the War College job.

41:12.879 --> 41:14.213
I knew it, I knew it.

41:14.214 --> 41:15.514
I mean, you got to.

41:15.515 --> 41:18.183
You know, it's challenging, it has scope.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.252
It's a chance for you to
influence policy makers.

41:20.253 --> 41:22.254
How do you turn that down?

41:22.255 --> 41:24.923
I know that you liked
your work at the NSA

41:24.924 --> 41:26.925
and you kind of miss a life of service.

41:26.926 --> 41:29.261
And if I'm gonna be in it,
why shouldn't you be?

41:29.262 --> 41:32.264
You know, we always talked
about being all in.

41:32.265 --> 41:33.932
And this is it, this is our chance.

41:33.933 --> 41:36.368
We're gonna let this
place go and go for it.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.037
I was gonna say that I think

41:38.038 --> 41:40.406
it would look really
nice with red shutters.

41:40.407 --> 41:42.441
Oh.

41:42.442 --> 41:43.942
Really?

41:43.943 --> 41:47.279
I was gonna say all that
other stuff after dinner.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.814
- I nailed it?
- Yeah, pretty much.

41:48.815 --> 41:51.050
I mean, it makes no sense
for us to keep this farm,

41:51.051 --> 41:52.851
especially if I'm gonna
take that other job.

41:52.852 --> 41:55.220
It's a much bigger commitment,
I'll be traveling a lot.

41:55.221 --> 41:57.523
I just wanted to be sure
that you were okay before...

41:57.524 --> 41:59.124
Okay.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.526
Uh, you don't have to say that.

42:00.527 --> 42:01.827
We can still think about it.

42:01.828 --> 42:03.495
I'm saying it... I don't
want to think about it.

42:03.496 --> 42:04.797
I'm tired of thinking about it.

42:04.798 --> 42:05.964
You know what?

42:05.965 --> 42:09.868
We can do all this bucolic
stuff when we're old.

42:09.869 --> 42:12.271
We're not old? That's awesome.

42:12.272 --> 42:14.573
This gets better and better.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.008
We got to tell the kids.

42:16.009 --> 42:17.242
Yeah, you do.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.677
- I...?
- That's gonna be rough.

42:18.678 --> 42:20.312
They love it here.

42:20.313 --> 42:22.781
(sighs) We're not ruining
their lives, are we?

42:22.782 --> 42:24.450
(chuckles) If we haven't
ruined their lives already,

42:24.451 --> 42:25.951
believe me, this isn't gonna do it.

42:25.952 --> 42:28.620
Okay, but if anybody starts crying,

42:28.621 --> 42:30.422
can I say that it was your idea?

42:30.423 --> 42:31.790
- My...? Okay, sure.
- ALISON: Hey, guys.

42:31.791 --> 42:32.958
I drew the short straw,

42:32.959 --> 42:34.893
so I get to tell you that
we're all really bored

42:34.894 --> 42:36.495
and wondering if we could
cut this weekend short

42:36.496 --> 42:38.529
and head home.

42:39.264 --> 42:42.706
Okay, it can be my idea. (chuckles)
