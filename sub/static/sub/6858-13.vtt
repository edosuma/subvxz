WEBVTT

00:17.392 --> 00:19.309
ANNOUNCER: A bid for revenge!

00:19.394 --> 00:22.187
Betrayed and left for dead
by Count Dooku,

00:22.313 --> 00:25.941
Asajj Ventress has begun a deadly game
with her former master,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.402
launching a secret assassination attempt
against him

00:28.528 --> 00:32.072
with the help of her kin,
the mysterious Nightsisters.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.200
Deceived into believing
the Jedi are behind the recent attack,

00:35.577 --> 00:39.079
Dooku has traveled across the galaxy
to enlist the Nightsisters

00:39.164 --> 00:40.998
in his quest for vengeance.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.764
Mother Talzin.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.849
Count Dooku.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.561
Come, we have much to discuss.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.154
Thank you for receiving me, Sister.

01:12.572 --> 01:16.325
I believe the old alliance can again be
what it once was.

01:16.659 --> 01:22.122
You would only have to pledge your
clan's allegiance to the Separatists' cause.

01:22.457 --> 01:27.294
We could certainly use the powers
of the Nightsisters against the Jedi.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.756
Such a generous offer, Count.

01:31.257 --> 01:36.011
But our loyalty is reserved
for only each other.

01:36.679 --> 01:41.475
The only reason I am aiding
in your search for a new assassin

01:41.518 --> 01:45.187
is because, long ago,
you chose to help me.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.649
After this matter is resolved,

01:48.983 --> 01:51.652
I hope our paths never cross again.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.321
As you wish, Sister.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.709
Drink.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.880
You must gather your strength
after such a long journey.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.049
Thank you.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.637
Blackroot, to replenish the body.

02:19.472 --> 02:25.561
You have heard of the Sith Warrior
Darth Maul, have you not?

02:26.229 --> 02:32.067
Yes. He was slain on Naboo
at the hand of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

02:32.569 --> 02:36.530
A few still remain in his bloodline.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.577
The men dwell on the far side of Dathomir.

02:42.370 --> 02:46.748
What if I could provide another of his kind?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.918
A warrior of the same caliber?

02:50.086 --> 02:51.378
Yes.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.755
But I warn you,

02:53.798 --> 02:57.968
men are easy to acquire, hard to control.

02:58.970 --> 03:03.432
With my last assassin,
Asajj Ventress, dead,

03:03.641 --> 03:06.476
and the Jedis' attacks against me
increasing,

03:06.769 --> 03:10.939
procuring a new personal assassin
is essential.

03:11.441 --> 03:16.111
Very well. It shall be done, my Lord.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.624
So he has agreed
to take another apprentice.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.959
A barbarian, no less.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.838
A man who we will deliver to the Count

03:34.964 --> 03:40.510
with all of the training and skill
an assassin can possess.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.473
This warrior
must have no loyalty to Dooku.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.143
He will be our pawn.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.686
Yes.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.188
Yes!

03:51.606 --> 03:56.151
We will use our magicks
to manipulate his assassin,

03:56.277 --> 03:59.488
and when the time is right...

03:59.781 --> 04:03.158
Dooku will pay for his betrayal,

04:03.326 --> 04:04.868
with his life.

04:05.495 --> 04:10.499
You will go to the far side of Dathomir
and find the men.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.211
You will select
the most suitable candidate,

04:14.671 --> 04:17.673
one with your strength and skill,

04:18.007 --> 04:21.885
one we can use to our advantage.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.595
Yes, Mother.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.219
Welcome, Sister.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.763
I have come for the selection.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.224
Yes, yes, of course.

05:09.392 --> 05:13.395
Line up! Heads of each tribe!
Line up for the Sister!

05:14.063 --> 05:17.399
Feral, try not to draw attention to yourself.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.319
That won't be a problem for me, Savage.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.252
What a fine-looking specimen.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.880
But looks aren't everything.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.591
(CHOKING)

05:56.981 --> 05:58.065
Too small.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.483
(GRUNTS)

06:00.943 --> 06:02.611
Too weak.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.365
These will do.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.702
Him.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.832
And him.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.964
These men are to your liking, Sister?

06:23.508 --> 06:24.591
Yes.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.427
Now for the tests.

06:27.637 --> 06:32.140
There will be three of them.
Whoever survives will be my champion

06:32.392 --> 06:33.975
and go on to serve me.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.769
Understood?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.521
-Yes, Sister!
-Yes, Sister!

06:39.232 --> 06:42.734
Excellent! Let the games begin!

07:02.630 --> 07:04.798
We must be vigilant, Feral.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.217
Aren't I always?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.100
Feral!

08:03.357 --> 08:04.608
Brother, get up!

08:04.859 --> 08:07.235
The witch, where is she?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.699
Pathetic!

08:15.244 --> 08:17.871
Where are the warriors I came for?

08:18.247 --> 08:21.249
Is this all the power these men possess?

08:24.253 --> 08:27.506
In order to fight against the Force,

08:27.757 --> 08:30.926
you must see what cannot be seen.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.769
Only four of you remain.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.148
Who will be the first to fall?

08:53.491 --> 08:54.658
(VENTRESS LAUGHING)

08:57.745 --> 08:59.287
(VENTRESS CONTINUES LAUGHING)

09:09.674 --> 09:11.341
VENTRESS: Not fast enough!

09:11.801 --> 09:13.260
(VENTRESS LAUGHING)

09:40.246 --> 09:41.329
Show yourself!

09:44.667 --> 09:45.834
Good.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.678
Let the third and final challenge begin!

09:58.598 --> 10:01.016
There are only two of us left, brother,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.685
but only one will survive.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.062
No, not if I can help it.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.945
Stick together. We must work as a team.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.710
Go!

10:55.237 --> 10:56.404
Savage!

11:28.479 --> 11:29.646
As long as I live,

11:29.939 --> 11:31.439
you will not harm him!

11:44.286 --> 11:47.831
Please. Spare him. Take me.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.001
Leave us.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.022
My life is yours.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.025
Yes, it is.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.060
He has surrendered his life to me.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.153
This one is strong.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.202
A perfect male specimen.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.791
Such hate!

13:55.125 --> 13:58.002
The sheer power of it.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.548
A tremendous gift
from the galaxy, Mother.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.258
He will serve us well.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.768
(SISTERS CHANTING)

15:05.571 --> 15:08.114
He is ready, Sisters.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.075
Look at the strength in him!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.785
The power!

15:21.420 --> 15:22.587
(GROANS)

15:31.305 --> 15:33.389
Let me go!

15:33.807 --> 15:36.017
Calmly, Sister.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.605
Let me go.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.824
That's better.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.454
Bring in the prisoner!

15:57.164 --> 16:00.333
Now for the final test.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.926
Savage?

16:12.012 --> 16:13.262
Kill him.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.809
Savage, you know me.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.978
I am your kin!

16:20.437 --> 16:21.980
Do not do this!

16:23.816 --> 16:26.609
I said, kill him!

16:28.028 --> 16:29.112
No!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.446
Brother!

16:30.739 --> 16:32.073
Brother, please!

16:32.700 --> 16:35.284
You beg?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.161
Weakling!

16:37.746 --> 16:38.746
(CHOKING)

16:39.331 --> 16:40.581
Savage!

16:41.834 --> 16:42.834
(NECK SNAPS)

16:47.339 --> 16:48.631
Good.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.008
Very good.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.053
You will learn to draw your strength
from your emotions.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.014
Hate will feed you.

16:56.598 --> 17:01.602
Never sympathize with the enemy,
not even for a moment.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.188
Yes, Sister.

17:06.775 --> 17:10.778
For you, an enchanted blade,

17:11.280 --> 17:15.575
blessed with our most potent magicks.

17:15.868 --> 17:21.205
I think it's time we introduce
the apprentice to his new master.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.708
Wouldn't you agree?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.478
At last.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.491
Sister.

17:56.867 --> 18:01.621
Count Dooku, may I present

18:02.331 --> 18:05.083
Savage Oppress.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.186
He certainly is a sight to behold.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.482
The fiercest of his kind, my Lord.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.777
He shall serve you well.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.822
Yes, he shall.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.876
Mother Talzin speaks very highly
of your skills.

18:49.378 --> 18:54.173
Still, I require proof
of your abilities as a warrior.

18:57.136 --> 19:01.806
The Jedi are in control of a vital outpost
on the jungle planet of Devaron.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.558
A temple.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.143
A temple?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.478
Do not be fooled, Savage.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.815
The Temple of Eedit serves only as a front

19:10.899 --> 19:14.026
for the military operations of the Republic.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.071
It is essential that we seize the Temple

19:17.156 --> 19:21.826
if the Separatists ever hope to take control
of that corner of the galaxy.

19:22.327 --> 19:27.582
You shall go to Devaron
and take what is rightfully ours.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.542
Yes, my Lord.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.366
Get him!

20:12.169 --> 20:13.544
Jedi!

20:17.466 --> 20:19.342
-Master?
-Stay back!

20:31.730 --> 20:33.314
No!

20:46.703 --> 20:49.163
-My Lord.
-Is it finished?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.583
Yes. The Temple has been taken.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.419
-And the Jedi?
-Dead.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.339
Very impressive, Savage.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.676
Return to Serenno immediately.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.761
Very well, my Lord.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.938
You have done well, Savage.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.899
I'll have much use for you.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.318
Thank you, my Lord.

21:21.321 --> 21:25.324
I foresee we will do great things together.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.412
I shall teach you the ways of the dark side.

21:29.871 --> 21:35.751
Soon your powers will rival
that of the great Sith Lord Darth Maul.

21:36.586 --> 21:41.841
We will be even more powerful
than Lord Sidious.

21:42.718 --> 21:48.222
We shall rule the galaxy together,
my apprentice.

21:48.890 --> 21:53.394
I am your servant, Master.
