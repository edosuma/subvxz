00:07.567 --> 00:10.737
I got it.
Yeah, thank you, Vic.

00:10.904 --> 00:14.157
Table ready upstairs at Melville's
for the Anderson party.

00:14.324 --> 00:17.744
Table ready for the Anderson party.

00:17.911 --> 00:19.954
- Your name is Anderson?
- Yeah.

00:21.039 --> 00:23.500
I guess there must be
two Anderson parties.

00:23.667 --> 00:27.837
- What's the first name?
- Ernie, but they call me Coach.

00:28.004 --> 00:30.507
There are two Anderson parties here.

00:30.674 --> 00:33.677
Would you call upstairs
and find out who gets the table?

00:33.843 --> 00:35.887
Good idea.

00:37.013 --> 00:40.684
Vic, we've got a problem.
There are two Anderson parties.

00:40.850 --> 00:44.771
Which one is it?
Oh, thanks, Vic.

00:44.938 --> 00:50.777
Thanks. I got it, Vic. I'm sorry,
I was wrong. It's not for the Andersons.

00:50.944 --> 00:54.614
It's for the Blubberbutts.

00:54.781 --> 00:58.993
Table ready for the Blubberbutts!
Table ready for the Blubberbutts!

Dylan Thomas, Delmore Schwartz,
Fitzgerald, Faulkner...

02:14.611 --> 02:18.740
they all drank themselves to death.
Gone before their time.

02:18.907 --> 02:21.743
So, can I get you another round?

02:23.703 --> 02:29.459
- Diane's mouth has sprung a leak again.
- Excuse me? We have to leave.

02:29.626 --> 02:32.754
- Could we get our waitress now?
- Sure.

02:32.921 --> 02:36.257
Here's my theory on the relationship
between alcohoI and genius.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.593
Writing is a lonely profession.
You know...

02:39.510 --> 02:42.847
Excuse me for a moment.
Carla! Carla!

02:43.014 --> 02:46.809
- Please! Please! Carla!
- Here you go.

02:46.976 --> 02:50.396
- Could we get our cheque please?
- Certainly.

02:52.106 --> 02:55.193
Carla, I've told you before,
keep your hands off Diane.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.987
I will if you will.

03:00.406 --> 03:04.327
Carla... I have two things to say to you.

03:04.494 --> 03:06.955
First, don't ever do that again

03:07.121 --> 03:09.540
or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

03:09.707 --> 03:13.670
And second, would this be
a bad time to ask you for a favour?

03:13.836 --> 03:16.547
For you, there's no good time.

03:16.714 --> 03:20.510
Well then, I would greatly appreciate it
if you would switch schedules with me

03:20.677 --> 03:22.845
so that I can have next Tuesday off.

03:23.012 --> 03:25.223
No!

03:25.390 --> 03:30.395
Carla, Oriana Fallaci is giving a speech
at Harvard.

03:30.561 --> 03:34.190
Come on, please.
You've gotta change with me.

03:34.357 --> 03:37.485
I don't have to do nothing.
Before I do a favour for you,

03:37.652 --> 03:41.864
I would rather be dragged around town
by my tongue.

03:42.865 --> 03:47.662
Since you don't feeI strongly about it,
maybe Sam would like to decide for us.

03:47.829 --> 03:51.874
Ha! I'd rather flip a coin.
At least that way I'd have a chance.

03:52.041 --> 03:57.964
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means that since you two started...

03:58.131 --> 04:02.635
you know... She gets away with things
the rest of us wouldn't.

04:02.802 --> 04:06.013
- I beg your pardon!
- Carla, maybe you're right.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.558
Maybe I have been too easy on her.

04:08.725 --> 04:12.854
I'll take her in the back room
and teach her some obedience.

04:18.233 --> 04:21.696
I've got no feelings
about what you two do in private,

04:21.863 --> 04:26.743
no matter how disgusting,
sickening and putrid it is.

04:26.909 --> 04:29.245
I just don't think the rest of us
should suffer for it.

04:29.412 --> 04:33.291
Carla, all I asked you to do
was switch nights off with me

04:33.458 --> 04:35.501
and you turn it into a verbaI Iynching.

04:35.668 --> 04:38.379
What's the big deaI?
Changing one night?

04:38.546 --> 04:41.132
There you go again, taking her side!

04:43.759 --> 04:46.429
OK, all right.

04:46.596 --> 04:51.100
Diane, work Tuesday night
and let's just forget this whole thing.

04:51.267 --> 04:55.813
Sam, you obviously don't realise
how important this speech is to me.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.568
It's only one night, Carla.

05:00.735 --> 05:03.821
Hey, Diane, I think if you...

05:04.780 --> 05:09.619
Carla, come on, will...
Does anyone want to buy a bar?

05:09.785 --> 05:13.289
Sam, relax.
It's not fair to put you through this.

05:13.456 --> 05:18.252
- Carla, you don't have to switch
- Oh, good... good...

05:19.253 --> 05:23.466
- I've just come to an important decision.
- Good for you.

05:24.634 --> 05:27.136
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

05:27.303 --> 05:30.556
- Norman!
- Would you like a beer, Norm?

05:30.723 --> 05:33.851
I'd like to see
something in a size 54 sudsy.

05:34.018 --> 05:37.730
- So how's life treating you, Norm?
- The same.

05:37.897 --> 05:41.651
- That's too bad, Norm.
- If not worse.

05:41.817 --> 05:44.237
- What's wrong, Normie?
- Nothing.

05:44.403 --> 05:47.907
- Little personaI problem.
- If it's anything you wanna talk about...

05:48.074 --> 05:51.661
Nah, I thought I'd sit here
and let it gnaw at my gut for a while.

05:51.827 --> 05:54.997
Now, Normie, come on.
You're among friends here.

05:55.164 --> 05:57.917
If you can't talk to us,
who can you talk to?

05:58.084 --> 06:02.838
Not Vera, that's for sure.
She and I have split.

06:03.005 --> 06:06.717
- I'm sorry.
- What happened? What caused it?

06:06.884 --> 06:09.720
She said we no longer communicate,

06:09.887 --> 06:12.390
that I never listen to her,
a bunch of other stuff.

06:12.556 --> 06:14.558
Yak, yak, yak.

06:14.725 --> 06:19.230
Cheer up, Norm, maybe...
maybe this'll be good for you somehow.

06:19.397 --> 06:21.565
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely. Look at it this way.

06:21.732 --> 06:27.029
- You are a free man now, Norm.
- A carefree bachelor.

06:27.196 --> 06:29.991
- Yeah, I do have a pad now.
- Where is it?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.244
You know that big beautifuI building
down by the waterfront?

06:33.411 --> 06:36.122
You take a left there,
you drive for about a half an hour...

06:36.288 --> 06:40.501
- Don't come at night.
- This is gonna be a new life for you.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.588
- You just gotta get up and around a bit.
- I don't know.

06:44.755 --> 06:48.592
- Come on, man. Come on.
- What are you waiting for?

06:48.759 --> 06:52.680
- Come on, Norm.
- All right. I'm gonna do it.

06:59.020 --> 07:02.064
Stand back, I'm on the prowI.

07:12.992 --> 07:15.327
Slow up.

07:16.495 --> 07:19.623
Come on, man.

07:25.254 --> 07:30.551
- That was awfully quick, Norm.
- They know where to find me.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.178
Sam?

07:32.344 --> 07:34.388
- Read this.
- What is it?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.599
- My resignation.
- Your what?

07:36.766 --> 07:38.809
Read it.

07:38.976 --> 07:41.020
"Dear Sam...

07:42.730 --> 07:47.943
"Although my tenure here has been one
of value and enlightenment, still... "

07:48.110 --> 07:50.654
<i>ll faut cultiver notre jardin.</i>

07:52.698 --> 07:54.742
Come on!

07:54.909 --> 07:57.703
First, nobody resigns from a bar

07:57.870 --> 08:00.748
and second, nobody resigns in Latin.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.669
- It's French, Sammy.
- What does it mean, Cliff?

08:05.836 --> 08:11.133
Because of the idiomatic peculiarities,
it can't really be translated into English.

08:12.384 --> 08:15.721
"One must cultivate one's own garden. "

08:15.888 --> 08:21.810
Diane, you took some liberties
with the derogatory tense there but...

08:22.686 --> 08:24.813
I think we'II let it slide this time?

08:24.980 --> 08:27.733
What the hell's this about?

08:27.942 --> 08:30.694
It's because
I didn't take your side against Carla?

08:30.861 --> 08:34.865
No, Sam. The problem
with Carla is only a symptom.

08:35.032 --> 08:36.866
You see...

08:37.034 --> 08:42.957
it's clear that our working together
is making our lives miserable.

08:43.123 --> 08:47.294
Diane, you just can't leave like that.
We should have a party.

08:47.461 --> 08:52.591
Some booze, a lot of pretzels, some
munchies, get a lot of people together.

08:52.758 --> 08:58.806
- You mean, like this?
- Well, I guess that's goodbye, Diane.

09:01.016 --> 09:04.520
Sam, you don't need me tonight.
I wanna go home and start planning.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.276
Carla, what's the matter, sweetheart?
Are you all right?

09:12.403 --> 09:14.947
Don't you see?

09:15.114 --> 09:20.327
My life hasn't exactly been a bag of
roses, you know.

09:20.494 --> 09:26.750
My old man used to beat me. I
spent half my childhood in reform schooI.

09:26.917 --> 09:31.797
My husband was a rat who left me
with four hungry mouths to feed.

09:31.964 --> 09:34.008
But this...

09:34.174 --> 09:36.343
makes up for all that.

09:38.721 --> 09:42.474
I am the happiest woman alive.

09:42.641 --> 09:45.102
You know, I'm sorry.
I think this is a mistake.

09:45.269 --> 09:47.855
It's a tough town out there...
Norm, am I right?

09:48.022 --> 09:52.359
Most employers wouldn't spit on you
if your hair was on fire.

09:52.526 --> 09:57.281
But you'll make it, kid.
I know you will. You've got moxie.

09:57.448 --> 10:00.492
I know. You all think I'm nothing

10:00.659 --> 10:05.789
but an orchid, unequipped to survive
in anything but a rarefied atmosphere.

10:05.956 --> 10:09.626
I'll have you know,
there's weed in me.

10:11.295 --> 10:14.548
What a farewell speech.
It went on exactly the right length.

10:14.715 --> 10:19.094
Any more would have been
too much of a good thing.

10:19.261 --> 10:22.139
Hey, you're really going to do this,
aren't you?

10:22.306 --> 10:26.935
- Sam, I'm doing this for us.
- Really?

10:27.102 --> 10:32.441
Yes. Now don't you want to spend
your nights with a woman who's fulfilled,

10:32.608 --> 10:35.402
independent, self-actualised?

10:35.569 --> 10:38.781
I suppose it's worth a shot.
You got her number?

10:53.856 --> 10:57.109
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

10:57.276 --> 11:00.488
I have wonderfuI news. I've got a job!

11:00.654 --> 11:04.033
- Write us about it.
- Good for you.

11:04.200 --> 11:10.164
I know you all thought I was a sociaI
misfit, unable to function on the streets.

11:10.331 --> 11:14.043
Well, I not only got a job,
I've got a great job!

11:14.210 --> 11:18.547
I'm a proofreader for a small publishing
house. Isn't that perfect for me?

11:18.714 --> 11:20.758
I'm proud of you.

11:20.925 --> 11:24.011
Well, it's been two weeks of hell,
but I did it.

11:24.178 --> 11:26.222
What's going on here, Norm?

11:26.388 --> 11:30.184
You been looking for months and
Diane snags a job in a couple of weeks?

11:30.351 --> 11:32.394
Well, it's easier for girls.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.981
If God had made me a woman,
I'd never be out of work.

11:36.148 --> 11:40.945
Well, yeah,
as long as there are carnivals.

11:46.825 --> 11:51.121
You know, I was scepticaI
about you finding something,

11:51.288 --> 11:56.877
but I guess it won't kill me
to come out and say... congratulations!

11:57.044 --> 11:59.088
Thank you, Carla.

12:06.428 --> 12:08.681
Carla, get up, will ya?

12:12.434 --> 12:18.107
- So, when do you start?
- I'm not sure yet.

12:18.274 --> 12:20.401
How come?

12:20.567 --> 12:25.948
The job isn't exactly, officially,
technically, completely, finally definite.

12:26.115 --> 12:28.450
- You don't have the job?
- No. I've got it.

12:28.617 --> 12:31.787
I poured out my heart for nothing?

12:32.997 --> 12:36.208
Carla, Carla, I have the job!
I have the job!

12:41.130 --> 12:45.134
It's just that there's one small formality
that has to be taken care of.

12:45.301 --> 12:51.307
- And that's what?
- Mr Hedges wants a reference.

12:51.473 --> 12:58.480
He'll call you tonight. You will say
wonderfuI things about me, won't you?

12:58.647 --> 13:01.567
- Sam, we'll need more red wine here.
- OK.

13:01.734 --> 13:05.988
I will tell him that you are the best
cocktaiI waitress I've ever seen.

13:06.155 --> 13:09.742
And then I'll tell him that I'd like to
sell him some land in Florida that I own.

13:09.908 --> 13:13.871
No kidding? Where is it?
We might be neighbours.

13:16.331 --> 13:19.418
I wonder what Vera's doing tonight.

13:19.585 --> 13:22.838
By the way, Normie,
how did you and Vera meet?

13:23.005 --> 13:25.799
Didn't I tell you?
We were in schooI together.

13:25.966 --> 13:27.760
We were?

13:27.926 --> 13:31.764
- Not you and I. Vera and I.
- Good.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.643
She was a cute little thing back then.

13:36.810 --> 13:39.146
Boy, could she give a hickey.

13:39.313 --> 13:42.191
Famous all over the Midwest for it.

13:43.233 --> 13:48.489
She gave me one the night of the senior
prom. It lasted till a year ago Christmas.

13:51.867 --> 13:55.662
- Give her a call, big fella.
- I don't think so.

13:55.829 --> 13:57.664
Normie?

13:57.831 --> 14:00.834
Yeah, I probably
should just see how she's doing.

14:01.001 --> 14:04.421
- Here, Normie. Save a dime. Wait.
- Thanks, Coach.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.015
Vera? It's Norm.

14:15.933 --> 14:18.811
How are you doing?
Great.

14:21.522 --> 14:23.607
So, what are you up to?

14:25.442 --> 14:29.196
You have a date? Yes, I'm hurt.

14:29.363 --> 14:32.991
I know it's been two weeks, but...

14:33.158 --> 14:37.287
You know, it so happens
that I have a date myself.

14:37.454 --> 14:40.624
Yeah, I've been getting around.
You don't believe me?

14:42.167 --> 14:45.420
She's right here.
You can talk to her yourself.

14:47.089 --> 14:49.132
Hello.

14:50.342 --> 14:55.347
Mrs Peterson,
thank you for letting Normie go.

14:55.514 --> 14:57.558
He's such an animaI.

14:59.101 --> 15:03.063
I've never known a man who can thrill
me the way he does.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.441
He touches me and I'm a woman.

15:06.608 --> 15:09.987
A totaI, quivering woman.

15:13.699 --> 15:15.993
All right. Thanks, Carla.

15:16.159 --> 15:19.162
Say, Carla, wanna...

15:22.916 --> 15:25.043
maybe get some coffee or something?

15:25.210 --> 15:27.337
Get reaI.

15:30.549 --> 15:32.634
Yeah, Cheers.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.887
Yeah, he's in the back.
Who can I say is calling?

15:36.054 --> 15:38.473
- Hedges?
- Coach, that's my boss!

15:38.640 --> 15:42.227
Are you the Ducky Hedges
who owes me 50 bucks?

15:43.979 --> 15:47.858
- Anybody can say they're not him!
- No, Coach!

15:48.025 --> 15:50.527
What colour was Red Wilson's hair?

15:50.694 --> 15:52.779
Ducky!

15:52.946 --> 15:56.742
You bet I'm an idiot
for ever loaning you 50 bucks!

15:56.908 --> 15:58.952
You no good chiseller!

15:59.119 --> 16:04.708
I loaned you that money and you
thought I'd forget. Well, I fooled ya!

16:04.875 --> 16:09.629
- Coach, come on, let me have it.
- Give it back when you're through.

16:09.796 --> 16:11.798
Hello?

16:11.965 --> 16:15.719
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.
No, I've been expecting your call.

16:15.886 --> 16:19.598
You want to know about Diane
Chambers? I can make this simple.

16:19.765 --> 16:24.144
She's... she's brilliant,
she's competent, she's efficient.

16:24.311 --> 16:27.606
I recommend her completely.

16:28.648 --> 16:32.444
What's that?
Yeah, what do you wanna know?

16:33.570 --> 16:36.615
I don't think
I wanna answer that question.

16:36.782 --> 16:39.618
- No, I don't think I wanna answer it.
- Answer it!

16:39.785 --> 16:42.621
Yeah, I've seen her naked.

16:53.381 --> 16:58.470
Mr Hedges, this is Diane Chambers.
You are the most rotten, disgusting pig.

16:58.637 --> 17:01.973
I wouldn't work for you if it was...
How much?

17:02.140 --> 17:04.184
Does that include medicaI?

17:05.268 --> 17:09.439
What am I saying? I wouldn't take
your job if it were the last in Boston!

17:10.357 --> 17:14.194
- Told him, Diane.
- I can kiss that 50 bucks goodbye.

17:16.780 --> 17:23.537
- He's only interested in my body.
- Sometimes I'm ashamed to be a guy.

17:24.871 --> 17:30.210
But if I made the switch now,
I'd have to buy a whole new wardrobe.

17:30.377 --> 17:32.629
Men are beginning to really disgust me.

17:32.796 --> 17:35.966
- Even more than before.
- Come on!

17:36.132 --> 17:38.593
Lighten up!
I mean one rotten apple doesn't...

17:38.760 --> 17:41.805
No, not one.
We're talking orchards here.

17:43.557 --> 17:49.104
The few scant offers I've had for a job
have all had sexuaI strings attached.

17:49.271 --> 17:52.232
It makes me crazy
thinking of those guys

17:52.399 --> 17:54.651
treating my squeeze like a sex object.

17:57.487 --> 17:58.989
Here, here.

17:59.155 --> 18:04.160
Well, I guess I'm not going to get any
purely professionaI offers.

18:04.327 --> 18:08.498
Why don't you come back to the bar?
This is where you belong.

18:08.665 --> 18:14.004
This is where your people are, where
your friends are, where your big guy are.

18:15.672 --> 18:18.341
- Where my heart are.
- Yeah.

18:18.508 --> 18:21.052
Hey, guys, I think she's coming back.

18:27.726 --> 18:31.271
Hey, why don't you
let me go get my coat...

18:32.439 --> 18:35.483
and then we'll go over to my place...

18:36.818 --> 18:39.904
and we'll celebrate your homecoming?

18:40.071 --> 18:42.365
- Great.
- You may need this.

19:02.886 --> 19:06.014
- Sam? I was just thinking...
- Oh, yeah?

19:06.181 --> 19:09.601
I tried that once. Never cared for it.
Come on. Let's go.

19:11.561 --> 19:13.980
- Sam!
- Nice?

19:17.233 --> 19:19.277
Why did you rehire me just now?

19:20.362 --> 19:22.989
I hired you because
you're the best combination

19:23.156 --> 19:27.410
girlfriend-waitress in the city.
And you stink as a waitress.

19:27.577 --> 19:29.788
- Exactly what I thought!
- What?

19:29.954 --> 19:33.249
You hired me for sexuaI purposes.

19:33.416 --> 19:36.044
Just like that swine,
Mr Hedges, wanted to do.

19:36.211 --> 19:42.592
- Come on! It's completely different.
- How is it completely different?

19:44.260 --> 19:46.304
Well, it...

19:46.471 --> 19:48.681
All right, for instance...

19:49.557 --> 19:51.601
you're nuts about me.

19:52.727 --> 19:57.607
Yes, but who knows, in time
I may have become nuts about him.

19:57.774 --> 20:01.402
We had a few things in common.

20:01.569 --> 20:04.072
We both find me adorable.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.866
- This is serious!
- All right.

20:07.033 --> 20:11.621
How can I come back knowing
you think of me as nothing but your...

20:11.788 --> 20:13.832
handmaiden?

20:16.584 --> 20:18.837
You know, Diane...

20:19.003 --> 20:24.050
it gets me the way you women are
always talking about sex on the job.

20:24.217 --> 20:26.553
I mean, as if you were the only victims.

20:27.804 --> 20:32.058
- What about me?
- What about you?

20:32.225 --> 20:35.562
You took this job
because you wanted to be a waitress?

20:35.728 --> 20:38.398
Absolutely not. I...

20:38.565 --> 20:42.110
I had a burning desire
to discover and explore

20:42.277 --> 20:45.071
this vein of American culture.

20:45.238 --> 20:51.786
Bull! You had a burning desire
to explore Mount Sammy here.

20:54.664 --> 20:58.084
- What are you saying?
- You took this job because I'm here.

20:58.251 --> 21:02.922
- You had sex on your mind, too.
- That's not true!

21:03.089 --> 21:05.675
Not entirely true!

21:06.968 --> 21:09.304
How do you think it makes me feeI

21:09.470 --> 21:14.767
to know that the first time you saw me
you undressed me with your eyes.

21:14.934 --> 21:18.938
You had no regard for my dignity
as a man and an employer.

21:19.105 --> 21:23.860
I was just a challenge to you.
Another notch on your belt.

21:24.027 --> 21:26.154
I am a person. I have dignity too.

21:28.448 --> 21:30.742
I know you have no regard for this job.

21:30.908 --> 21:33.995
And you continually tell me
that I have the brain of a cucumber.

21:34.162 --> 21:39.667
So what's left? The only thing left is that
you want your physicaI lust satisfied.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.878
And that's where I come in.

21:47.634 --> 21:51.054
- There's only one thing to do.
- I know, I know...

21:51.220 --> 21:55.099
- I'll undress and do my duty.
- No!

21:56.643 --> 22:00.480
No, you've shown me the light.
I've been a cad.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.109
OK. I propose...

22:05.276 --> 22:09.906
that you and I abstain
from physicaI contact for one month.

22:10.073 --> 22:12.659
Strictly business for one month.

22:12.825 --> 22:17.288
I think that's the only way that
each of us can regain our self-respect.

22:18.539 --> 22:21.793
I think that's a very good idea.
It would help me a lot.

22:22.668 --> 22:24.879
Fine. One month it is.

22:25.046 --> 22:27.256
- Mr Malone.
- Miss Chambers.

22:29.300 --> 22:32.804
There is just one more thing.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.765
I think... Please, have a seat.

22:36.641 --> 22:41.979
I think that my self-respect
bounces back quicker than you expect.

22:43.314 --> 22:50.571
I think two weeks of... strictly business,
and I'll be back in peak shape.

22:50.738 --> 22:54.534
Maybe, if I concentrate, one week.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.996
I believe that my recuperative powers
are even greater than yours.

23:00.456 --> 23:02.750
A day would be fine with me.

23:02.917 --> 23:07.046
The important thing is that
we both know that we could stop.

23:11.259 --> 23:15.221
I think that an hour
would certainly prove that.

23:16.389 --> 23:20.476
Well, from that argument it follows
that 15 minutes would be adequate.

23:20.643 --> 23:25.606
- That's enough time to get to my place.
- Let's hurry.

24:01.267 --> 24:02.268
