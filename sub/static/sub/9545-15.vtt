[Man #2]
That's a first, huh?

00:07.273 --> 00:09.241
Wanna grab some coffee?

00:09.309 --> 00:12.938
No. I gotta get home.
We're meeting the wedding planner.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.947
I thought
that was last night.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.950
No, last night was the caterer.
Should have taken my advice.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.952
Should have just eloped.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.750
Well, it's too late now.
No, it's not, man.
You can do it.

00:22.822 --> 00:26.758
Hop on a plane tonight.
Go to Vegas.
Boom. It's all over.

00:26.826 --> 00:30.887
Rachel's mom
would never speak to me again.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.898
That's the best argument
to do it.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.560
I been trying to get
my mother-in-law to shut up
for five years.

00:35.635 --> 00:38.365
- Whoa, what's this?
- What the hell are they doing?

00:43.443 --> 00:44.967
Hit the brakes!
I'm trying!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.275
Try the emergency brake!
This is Baker Four.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.815
We're on Vinton and Hillside.
It's a hijacking.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.874

Oh, toothache.

I told you to take care
of that.

You don't want to

You know what,
if anyone says anything,
we'll just say-

03:51.531 --> 03:54.625
Oh, my tooth. Oh.
Yeah, perfect!
That you have a toothache.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.726

Oh, God!
God, this hurts!

Oh, please, Jesus.
Somebody just shoot me.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.741
Randy, no one's gonna
believe that.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.970
There's some oil on the floor.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.446
Is that a clue?
Is that important?

04:08.514 --> 04:11.278
Nah. There's oil
on the floor.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.319
I'll call the E.P.A.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.320
So, do you, uh-

04:15.388 --> 04:17.447
Any ideas about the robbery?

04:17.523 --> 04:20.014
Did you notice the back bumper,
how damaged it was?
Yeah.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.688
These side mirrors are pushed in.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.857
I don't think this armored car
was driven here.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.226
It wasn't?
No.

04:30.303 --> 04:36.208
I think it was carried somehow
in the back of a bigger truck.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.767
You can see the tire tracks
from a larger vehicle.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.779
You're right.

04:40.847 --> 04:44.374
It was probably an 18-wheeler
about 14 feet wide.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.953
So they brought
the armored car here,
they unload it.

04:50.023 --> 04:53.891
How did they get the drivers
out of the cab?

04:58.031 --> 05:01.660
With this.
Piece of rubber tubing.

05:02.902 --> 05:06.565
They drilled the hole here
in the Plexiglas.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.874
They gassed 'em out.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.741
Huh. Randy.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.941
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Bag this stuff.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.746
[Groans]
He has a toothache.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.788
Yeah, I know.
He's been bitching
about it all week.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.914
What, it's a real toothache?
Yeah.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.017
[Slaps Arm]
I can't believe
you lied to me like that.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.655
- Why didn't you just say,
"I have a toothache"?
- I did, like 10 times.

05:31.731 --> 05:35.167
Randy, if you don't take care
of this tooth immediately, today,

05:35.234 --> 05:37.828
I'm gonna rip it out myself.
You understand?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.838
Fine.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.265
What?

05:47.747 --> 05:49.977

05:50.049 --> 05:52.279

05:52.352 --> 05:54.320
Yeah.
Oh, good.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.652
I'm Terri.
You do all your paperwork?

05:57.724 --> 06:00.284
Both sides.
Good boy.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.625
Yeah. Where's your receptionist?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.187
Oh. Our nighttime receptionist quit.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.199
Couldn't stand
the excitement, huh?

06:08.267 --> 06:11.395
[Laughs]
I guess not.
So you're gonna be in room "B."

06:11.471 --> 06:15.737
- That's between "A" and "C."
- Well, what if I get lost?

06:15.808 --> 06:17.742
You want me
to draw you a map?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.744
Yeah, I think I can find it.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.887
Yeah.
I can usually guess

06:39.532 --> 06:41.762

on such short notice.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.200
Oh, that's not a problem.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.205
We're open late
on Tuesdays and Thursdays
in case of emergencies.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.707
Also to keep Terri here
off the streets.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.710
[Laughs]
He worries about me.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.178
I do. You know what
I'm really worried about?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.477
I worry about
this bad boy right here,

06:56.549 --> 06:58.483
your number three molar.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.213
Terri, can I have
a light, please?
Mm-hmm.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.312
I want you to open wide...

07:03.389 --> 07:06.051
and just try to relax.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.719
Little wider.
Okay, just relax.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.286

- Okay, okay.
A little sensitive.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.822
<i>Well, I hope you're not</i>
<i>in love with that tooth,</i>
<i>Lieutenant,</i>

07:14.901 --> 07:16.835
because I'm afraid
it's gonna have to go.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.838
We can either pull it next week,
or we can do it today.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.534
- The choice is yours.
- Let's do it now.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.771
Okay, Randy,
we're gonna put you under
for about 30 minutes.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.837
- Not gonna feel a thing.
- Uh-huh.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.180
As a matter of fact,
you're gonna be back here
every week for this.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.709
And if you're a really good boy,
I'm gonna give you a sticker
afterwards.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.120
What if I'm a bad boy?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.817
<i>[Bloom]</i>
<i>Just breathe.</i>

07:41.894 --> 07:45.193

- [Terri Laughs]
- [Voice Echoing]
Can you hear me?

07:48.401 --> 07:52.497
Just relax.
I want you to take
10 deep breaths. Okay?

07:52.572 --> 07:55.632
One. Two.

Captain, here's a copy
of the updated manifest.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.603
The cash was new, right?
Yes, sir. It would have been
easily traced.

10:07.673 --> 10:12.269
All they took were the negotiable
bank certificates. Over $10 million.
All right. Let's follow the money.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.644

could handle a haul like this?
I'll find out.

Yeah, sort of. I was sedated.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.164
It was great.
I didn't wanna wake up.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.437
Look, I was supposed to be out
for 30 minutes.
Mm-hmm.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.444
But I was under
for almost two hours.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.503
Was there a body?
No.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.172
Any signs of a struggle?
No.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.218
Who did they kill?
I don't know. It was a guy.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.482
Male. Caucasian.
5'11 ", 200 pounds.

11:29.555 --> 11:33.457
- They were arguing about Barry Bonds,
and I'm pretty sure that I can I.D. Him.
- Baseball player?

11:33.526 --> 11:39.192
Yeah! I think that this guy
thought that Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.098
They were arguing about
how much Barry Bonds was worth.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.796
If your dentist played baseball,
you know what team he'd play for.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.235
The Yanks.
Get it?

11:49.308 --> 11:51.708
[Laughs]
It's not funny.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.644
It's a little funny, Randy.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.806
Look, why don't you, um-

11:57.883 --> 12:00.283
Take a walk.

12:00.352 --> 12:03.844
Clear your head. Here.
Drop this off at Monk's.
He's waiting for this.

12:03.923 --> 12:08.155
Then take the rest
of the day off, okay?
Go to the movies, go to the beach.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.424
Okay? Get out of here.
I'll call you later.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.029
- Is this everything?
The whole file?
- Yeah.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.102
Monk, can I ask you a question?

12:22.174 --> 12:26.941
<i>What do you, uh, normally charge,</i>
<i>you know, for someone</i>
<i>who wants to hire you?</i>

12:27.012 --> 12:30.072
I mean, not the department.
A private party.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.312
- Like who?
- Like me.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.252
Is this about the dentist?
The captain called us.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.291
<i>He said you had a reaction</i>
<i>to the anesthesia.</i>

12:39.358 --> 12:42.885
- You were probably hallucinating.
- No, I wasn't hallucinating.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.590
It really happened.
I mean, it-

12:45.664 --> 12:48.531
It was as real as you are right now
standing in front of me.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.592
Randy.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.263
I'm not standing.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.703
But if you need my help,
you don't have to pay me.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.111
All you have to do is ask.

13:02.181 --> 13:06.140
I mean, you're
one of my oldest friends.
I've known you for years.

13:08.654 --> 13:13.853
- Thank you. I want you to come back
to the dentist's office with me-
- Let me finish.

13:13.926 --> 13:18.727
- Unfortunately, at the moment,
I have a lot of things on my plate.
- No, you don't.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.824
Well, l- I have
this armored car thing.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.530
I have to read this whole file.
That's about 120 pages.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.572
And I just found a typo,
by the way.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.235
And I have to replace
the lint filter on my dryer.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.575
Filters do not
replace themselves.
Mr. Monk, can I talk to you for a minute?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.582
I have to talk to Natalie
for a minute. What?
<i>Privately?</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:40.710
In the kitchen. Now.
Okay.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.777
Go.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.594
Mr. Monk,
this is Randy we're talking about.
He would do anything for-

13:49.662 --> 13:52.130
And I would do anything for him
except this, Natalie.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.428
I can't do it.
I have a <i>thing</i> about dentists.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.468
You have a thing about everything.

13:56.535 --> 14:00.232
That's true.
But dentists are in a separate category
all together. Okay?

14:00.306 --> 14:03.571
I can't even discuss it.
I can't even think about
discussing it.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.872
I can't even talk about
thinking about discussing it.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.176
Mr. Monk,
everybody's afraid of dentists.
Not like this.

14:09.248 --> 14:12.115
Not like this.
Okay, okay, okay. How afraid are you
on a scale of one to 10?

14:12.184 --> 14:16.120
[Laughs]
Ten? I am so far beyond 10,
I laugh at your 10s.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.089
I lie awake at night
dreaming about 10s.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.093
The chair and the probing
and the drilling and the rinsing.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.755
Okay, Mr. Monk,
what do you do
when you get a cavity?

14:24.830 --> 14:26.764
I don't get a cavity.
I don't get cavities.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.130
I brush my teeth 12 times a day
and I floss every 90 minutes.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.398
So you've never been to a dentist.
Once. When I was 12.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.632
- How'd that go?
- Not well.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.402
This is ridiculous.
We're just gonna go there
and look around.

14:38.477 --> 14:41.139
You're not a patient.
You're not sitting
in the chair.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.944
There's no probing.
There's no drilling.
I'll be with you the whole time.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.781
But l-
No.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.617
Oh, boy.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.958
He's happy to do it.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.994
Great.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.571
[Natalie Whispering]
I don't see anything.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.938
It happened
in the other room.
Room "B."

15:10.009 --> 15:12.307
What do you think?

15:12.378 --> 15:14.312
Psst. Mr. Monk.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.348
Pretty sure...

15:16.415 --> 15:19.578
this is how the Nazis
decorated their bunkers.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.984
Don't look at that.
Look-Look-Look down.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.386
Look at the carpet.
What a beautiful carpet.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.424
It is a beautiful carpet.
Right? Is that better?

15:26.492 --> 15:28.426
It is better.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.691
[Sighs]
Oh. <i>Highlights for Children.</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:34.392
Oh, "find the hidden picture."
I used to love these.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.696
"Where is the eggbeater?"

15:36.769 --> 15:38.760
It's under the sled.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.706
You're right.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.767
And the umbrella
is in the cloud above the snowman.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.903
And the fish
is next to the ice skate.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.039
Okay, how are you
doing that?

15:50.115 --> 15:55.143
I read that same issue
35 years ago. It was in the-

15:57.623 --> 16:00.649
It was in...
a dentist's office.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.321
Natalie, l- I can't do this.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can do this.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.557
You can do this.
You're doing great.
Well-

16:06.632 --> 16:09.533
Okay, here. Sit down and think
about something else, okay?

16:09.601 --> 16:12.798
Here. I brought the case file.
Concentrate on this.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.073
Lieutenant.
You back for more?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.135
[Laughs]
No. No.

16:21.213 --> 16:24.842
Actually, I think
I just left my cell phone
in the chair in room "B."

16:24.917 --> 16:27.078
Oh. Well, it's empty now
if you wanna take a look.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.120
Great.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.179
I'm Natalie.
I'm just gonna help him.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.247
He can't ever find anything.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.759
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right here.
Are you okay?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.854
[Groans]
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm good.

16:49.441 --> 16:52.410
Okay. I was in the chair.
Mm-hmm.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.276
And-They were fighting
over there.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.941
Okay. Well,
I don't see anything.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.455
He bought new equipment.

17:07.059 --> 17:11.051
He- He bought new equipment
to replace the stuff
that got broken during the fight.

17:12.263 --> 17:14.255
Maybe.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.396
<i>[Drill Whirring]</i>

17:24.242 --> 17:26.473
- What's that?
- It's a drill.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.479
<i>[Whirring Continues]</i>

17:28.547 --> 17:31.914
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.111
[Whispers]
Don't be afraid.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.451

Don't be afraid.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.492

<i>Mr. Monk, it's okay.</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:51.502
We're gonna go home now.
You can let go.
No, we're not going anywhere.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.505
He hasn't seen anything.
I think he's seen enough.

17:54.573 --> 17:58.669
Is there a problem?
Oh. No, no. I just left my cell phone
in the other room.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.236
Dr. Bloom,
this is Adrian Monk.
He's a friend of mine.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.782
<i>The</i> Adrian Monk? The detective?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.341
[Whimpers]

18:08.420 --> 18:11.685
- Apparently, the pleasure's all mine.
- He just has a little thing
about dentists.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.851
You know,
it happens to me all the time.
I don't take it personally.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.760
[Papers Hit Floor]
Let me help you with that.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.161
Oh, are you working
on the armored car case?

18:21.233 --> 18:24.725
I've been reading about it.
I'm a bit of a true crime aficionado.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.862
I'm sorry.
That's classified.

18:26.939 --> 18:30.102
Got a couple of hobbies then.
True crime and baseball.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.871
Baseball?
Baseball?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.711
Yeah. I'm sure I heard you guys
talking about Barry Bonds yesterday.
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:40.775
You know what?
People hear a lot of crazy things
when they're under sedation.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.152
They say a lot of
crazy things too.
I should write a book, really.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.090
Yes, sir. I understand.
Okay. We're on our way.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.320
We gotta go.
That was the captain.
Oh! We gotta go.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.056
Okay. Take care.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.301
[Sniffing]

18:58.370 --> 19:01.134
A couple of fishermen
just found him.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.642
Well, these two bruises,
10 inches apart-

19:04.710 --> 19:08.373
There's another set of bruises
exactly 10 inches apart.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.381
Yeah. What caused that?

19:10.449 --> 19:13.577
Well, must be something
10 inches apart.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.713
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, what do you got?
You said it was important.

19:17.789 --> 19:21.384
I found this in his trousers.
It was in his pants cuff.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.428
It's Plexiglas.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.932
He's gotta be
one of the hijackers.
He drilled the hole.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.595
So who is he?
Turn him over.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.737
- <i>I don't recognize him.</i>
<i>Do you?</i>
- No.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.742
Oh, my God.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.779
That's the guy.
That's the guy
from the dentist's office.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.611
Randy, I told you
to take some time off.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.617
No, Captain, that's the guy.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.279
I told you I could I.D. Him,
and that is definitely the guy.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.619
This is the guy
that your dentist killed
along with his hygienist?

19:52.691 --> 19:57.128
- That's right.
- This is the guy that they killed in front
of you while you were in the chair.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.427
That's right.
Because Dr. Bloom
kidnapped Barry Bonds,

20:00.499 --> 20:02.967
and they were arguing
about the ransom money.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.969
Yeah, what,
is that so crazy?
[Laughing]

20:05.037 --> 20:07.301
What the hell are you
laughin' at, Patterson?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.932
I'm not crazy.
Nobody said you were crazy,
Randy.

20:10.008 --> 20:12.602
Out loud.
You should have had 'em
put some wisdom teeth in.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.909
Hey, you can't even spell
wisdom teeth, Downey.
All right, look, Natalie.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.472
What?
You and Monk were there, right?
Did you notice anything?

20:18.550 --> 20:22.213
Mmm. No, l- I wasn't really
on my game.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.120
<i>I have this thing</i>
<i>about dentists.</i>

and snakes are here,

20:31.296 --> 20:34.163
You see that branch up there,
the second one from the top?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.224
The one above that one.

20:36.301 --> 20:39.930
Captain, are you going to
investigate this or not?

20:40.005 --> 20:43.634
Randy, you were sedated.
You couldn't have seen anything.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.944
Fine. I quit.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.505
You what?
No, I quit.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.677

of being treated like
the village idiot.

Here's my gun.
Randy, come on.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.923
And my badge.
I'm not a joke.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.755
I'm not here to entertain you.
I'm a homicide detective.

Take it.

Randy.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.864
Randy.

21:33.959 --> 21:38.089
He was charged five times.
Excessive force, conduct unbecoming.

Took an early retirement
four years ago.
Thanks.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.671
What's he doing?

21:47.739 --> 21:50.401
Flossing. He's determined
never to go back
to a dentist again.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.410
- [Muffled]
Just pretend I'm not here.
- Monk, cut it out.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.810
I mean it.
This is a floss-free zone.

21:56.815 --> 22:01.309
Since when?
<i>Since right now.</i>
<i>Cut it out.</i>

22:04.256 --> 22:06.247

22:10.829 --> 22:13.263
Yeah. I figured
it couldn't hurt
to check him out.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.733
You're doing this for Randy,
aren't you?
Why don't you just call him?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.929
Because he quit.

22:19.004 --> 22:23.270
Randy is an adult.
He made a decision,
and I respect it.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.936
You miss him.
I can tell.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.673
Look, Natalie, it's not like
we were going steady, okay?

22:28.747 --> 22:30.942
We worked together.
He was just another cop.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.179
That is not true.
You're right. It's not true.

22:34.252 --> 22:38.382
He's not just another cop.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.602
## [Plays Notes]
I printed up
some lyric sheets.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.799
Why do we need lyric sheets?
You're the only one singing.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.901
Just so you can follow along
so you know what it's about.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.572
- We're making a statement.
- We are?

23:04.950 --> 23:07.248
Okay. Let's do it.
From the top.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.981
A-five, six, seven, eight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.751
- What was that?
- Countin' off.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.758
Five, six, seven, eight?

23:14.826 --> 23:18.057
<i>That's for dancing.</i>
No, it's not.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.360
You're supposed to go,
"One, two, three, four."

23:20.432 --> 23:23.629
- Come on. What's the difference?
- It's rock and roll, man.

23:23.702 --> 23:27.160
Let's do that blues song
we used to do.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.173
Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, guys, guys!

23:29.241 --> 23:31.300
Why don't we just stick
to the original material?

23:31.376 --> 23:33.901
Okay? That's what
the people wanna hear.

23:33.979 --> 23:37.244
<i>What people, Randy?</i>
<i>We're in my stepfather's garage.</i>

23:37.315 --> 23:39.647
Well, Aaron, there might be
people one day.

23:40.786 --> 23:45.018
I mean, touring. Record deal.
Come on, guys.
Wasn't that the dream?

23:45.090 --> 23:48.753
Maybe... 17 years ago...
in 12th grade.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.761
Well, you know what?

23:50.829 --> 23:53.024
I still believe in the dream.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.066
I believe in the Randy Disher Project.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.192
Come on. I quit my job for this.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.705
- Big mistake.
- All right. Let's just do it, okay?

24:01.706 --> 24:03.640
From the top.

24:03.708 --> 24:07.940
If you say "five, six, seven, eight" again,
I quit. I'm just telling you.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.777
Do you know what?
Do you wanna be the lead singer?
'Scuse me.

24:10.849 --> 24:15.877
Uh- Can I talk to MickJagger
for a second?

24:16.955 --> 24:20.721
Yeah. Sure.
All right, guys.
Take a break, huh?

24:20.792 --> 24:24.284
Oh, it's a really good job so far though.
Really good.

24:24.362 --> 24:27.229
[Snickering]
He quit his job.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.427
How's it going?
It's good. It's great.

24:30.502 --> 24:33.471
I should have done this
years ago.
Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

24:33.538 --> 24:38.168
Um-You gotta send me a T-shirt
or a hat or something.

24:41.112 --> 24:43.171
Or whatever.
Uh, listen.

24:43.248 --> 24:47.378
I thought you might be interested.
We caught a break
on the armored car thing.

24:47.452 --> 24:51.354
We identified the body.
Guy's name is DennyJardeen.
He's an ex-cop.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.755
He's got a cousin
who's done some time...

24:53.825 --> 24:55.759
who works for
a trucking company.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.558
So we're gonna go pick him up.
I thought you'd like to come along.

24:59.631 --> 25:04.068
Why? I mean, I'm not a cop
anymore, Leland. Captain.

25:04.135 --> 25:08.128
Look. It's my notebook.
No more witness statements.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.674
Just lyrics
and song ideas now.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.405
You're writing songs?
Yeah, I wrote 17 last night.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.640
I'm on fire.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.649
I'm sure you are.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.742
Uh-

25:20.819 --> 25:23.754
I also wanted to apologize
about the dentist.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.756
It's-

25:25.824 --> 25:30.693
It's just that over the years
you've had, uh, s-
so many unique theories.

25:30.762 --> 25:35.495
I wasn't hallucinating.
Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out
myself on my own time.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.660
The guy is clean.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.933
He's got no priors.
He's never been in trouble.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.074
Just wanted you to know
that I took you seriously.

25:47.846 --> 25:53.148
The fact is, I miss you.
I need you.

25:57.355 --> 25:59.289
Well, it's too late.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.723
L- I'm moved on.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.784
I mean,
band's my life now.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.626
You're more than welcome
to come and have a listen
if you want.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.632
Come on in. Be my guest.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.691
Have a seat.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.829
Okay. How you doing?

26:15.040 --> 26:17.167
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

26:17.242 --> 26:20.234
I should warn you.
You might not like
what you hear.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.770
It's pretty powerful stuff.
You might not be able
to handle it.

26:23.848 --> 26:25.941
All right,
let's rock it out.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.918
<i>From the top.</i>
<i>A- one, two, three, four.</i>

26:28.987 --> 26:30.682
[Softly]
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:30.755 --> 26:34.156
<i>## [Rock]</i>
<i>#I'm tired of sucking up #</i>

26:34.225 --> 26:37.683
#Well, I'm tired of sucking up
and workin' for the man #

26:37.762 --> 26:41.858
# Keepin' people down

26:41.933 --> 26:45.460

27:11.863 --> 27:14.161
## [Ends]
All right.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.996
<i>That was good.</i>
<i>That wasn't too bad.</i>

27:19.104 --> 27:21.129
That was great.

27:26.077 --> 27:28.011
Okay, now before you even
knock on the door,

27:28.079 --> 27:32.448
I want you to douse this handkerchief
with the chloroform,
just like this, okay?

27:32.517 --> 27:36.681
About 20 c.c.'s.
And make sure
he really inhales it.

27:36.755 --> 27:38.780
I don't know about this.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.848
Well, we have to do it.
There's no choice.

27:40.925 --> 27:44.326
No, no. I know.
I mean, I don't know
if 20 c.c.'s is enough.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.864
How do you know
he's gonna talk?

27:46.931 --> 27:50.332
Did you see him?
He couldn't even shake my hand.
He was a mess.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.734
Yeah.
You get Adrian Monk
in here,

27:52.804 --> 27:55.739
and I'll make him talk.

27:56.808 --> 28:01.268
Neal, your fingerprints
were all over the warehouse
and on the armored car.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.280
You could hire
the best lawyer in the city.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.543
<i>He's not gonna make</i>
<i>those fingerprints disappear.</i>

28:05.617 --> 28:08.017
<i>It is all over, and you know it.</i>

28:11.956 --> 28:13.890
Okay.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.450
I was there, but I did-
I didn't do the two guards, man. L-

28:17.529 --> 28:19.463
I tried to stop him.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.695
- Stop who?
- Denny. DennyJardeen.

28:25.970 --> 28:29.030
When the guards fought back,
he went postal, man,
and started shootin'.

28:29.107 --> 28:33.510
- Where's the money, Neal?
- Denny's got it.

28:33.578 --> 28:36.741
He's keeping it in a shed
back behind his place
until we all split it up.

28:36.815 --> 28:40.273
I got some bad news
for ya, Neal.
Denny is dead.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.778
- Denny?
- And there's no money
in that little tool shed.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.053
- We've already ripped it apart.
- Ah, that's impossible.

28:48.126 --> 28:51.721
Looks like somebody
in your little sewing circle
got greedy.

28:53.598 --> 28:56.567
You can't trust anybody
these days, can you?
[Snickers]

29:00.338 --> 29:02.431
<i>[Knocking]</i>

29:02.507 --> 29:04.600

29:14.552 --> 29:16.884

Mr. Monk.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.719
I know it's late.
Can I come in?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.725
Of course. Of course.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.353
Thank you.
[Sobbing]

29:26.030 --> 29:27.964
W-W-What is it?

29:28.032 --> 29:30.364
Lieutenant Disher
was right.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.403
[Sniffs]

29:32.470 --> 29:36.270
Dr. Bloom killed a man
two days ago, and I don't
even know who it was.

29:36.341 --> 29:39.003
I mean, I've never
seen him before or anything.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.136
[Sobbing]

29:41.212 --> 29:43.305
I just don't know
where else to go.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.372
[Crying]

29:45.450 --> 29:48.544
Yeah. A-Are you gonna
be crying a lot?

29:48.620 --> 29:51.384
Maybe you wanna
lean over the sink.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.425
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm just scared to death.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.460
Yeah. I'll call the captain.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.463
No! No. Dr. Bloom
would kill me.
You can't.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.999
Oh, it's okay.
The police will protect you.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.162
Oh. What is that?
What? What, what?

30:06.237 --> 30:08.398
I don't know.
What is it?

30:08.473 --> 30:12.204
It's right-
It's something on your face,
like a smudge.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.336
Smudge.

30:14.412 --> 30:17.108
Yeah. No. No,
you're not getting it.
It's right there.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.514
Did I get it?
No.

30:19.584 --> 30:22.917
Here, I'll do it.
Hold on. Okay.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.781
Did you get it?
Uh-

30:26.858 --> 30:29.383
No?
No. It's right there.

30:30.595 --> 30:34.725
[Muffled]
Chloroform.

30:34.799 --> 30:37.324
You're d-
You're drugging me.
Shh.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.461
Just relax.

30:39.537 --> 30:41.630
Did you get it?

30:45.410 --> 30:47.435
[Slurred]
Did I get it?

30:51.649 --> 30:53.742
Did I get it?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.517
Did I get it?

31:04.429 --> 31:06.863
<i>Natalie.</i>
Captain, is Mr. Monk here?

31:06.931 --> 31:10.423
What would Monk be doing here?
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

31:10.501 --> 31:14.335
I called his house to read him
tomorrow's weather report
like always, but he didn't answer.

31:14.405 --> 31:18.136
So I go over there. The door's open.
The light's on, but he's not home.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.145
The door was open?

31:54.979 --> 31:57.914
Thank you for waiting.
The doctor will be right with you.

31:57.982 --> 32:00.280
There's... no rush.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.491
## [Humming]

32:08.559 --> 32:10.652
Why are you doing this?

32:12.597 --> 32:15.691
Why are you doing this?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.758
Please.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.826
Please.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.132
What are you gonna do?

32:25.710 --> 32:29.305
I didn't really have a smudge,
did I?

32:29.380 --> 32:31.610
Ooh. You should be flattered.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.878
The doctor doesn't usually
come in this late.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.614
Especially for new patients.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.679
That tooth.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.358
The roots are about-

32:42.427 --> 32:46.227
10 inches apart,
aren't they?

32:46.297 --> 32:49.061
If you say so.

32:50.134 --> 32:53.365
I get it now.
I know what happened.

32:53.438 --> 32:57.238
<i>The drivers fought back</i>
<i>during the hijacking.</i>

32:57.308 --> 33:00.038
<i>DennyJardeen</i>
<i>got hit in the face.</i>

33:00.111 --> 33:02.102
<i>He must have knocked</i>
<i>a tooth loose.</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:07.440
Jardeen came here
to get his tooth fixed.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.452
That makes sense.

33:09.520 --> 33:13.354
He's an ex-cop,
and you're on the medical plan.

33:13.424 --> 33:16.587
<i>He must have talked</i>
<i>in his sleep.</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:19.027
<i>Dr. Bloom</i>
<i>said a lot of patients do.</i>

33:19.097 --> 33:23.534
<i>He told you everything,</i>
<i>about the robbery,</i>
<i>where they hid the money.</i>

33:23.601 --> 33:28.231
- It must have been like
winning the lottery.
- If you say so.

33:28.306 --> 33:31.207
<i>That night,</i>
<i>you went toJardeen's house,</i>

33:31.275 --> 33:33.573
<i>found the money,</i>
<i>figured it was safe,</i>

33:33.644 --> 33:36.613
<i>that he would never remember</i>
<i>telling you anything.</i>

33:36.681 --> 33:38.842
But you were wrong.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.850
He did remember.

33:41.919 --> 33:45.320
Or maybe when
the money went missing,

33:45.390 --> 33:47.517
he just figured it out.

33:49.293 --> 33:53.730
<i>He came back here Tuesday night</i>
<i>when you were working on Randy.</i>

33:59.470 --> 34:01.995
Randy witnessed
the whole thing, sort of.

34:02.073 --> 34:04.541
He was right
about everything.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.644
Wasn't he?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.737
If you say so.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.839
Hello again, Mr. Monk.

34:15.652 --> 34:20.090
Is it true that you've only
been to the dentist once before?
Yeah.

34:20.158 --> 34:23.127
I gather it wasn't
a good experience.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.786
Oh, this will be much worse.

34:25.862 --> 34:29.161
I'm-
I'm a police officer.

34:29.233 --> 34:32.168
Oh, I know that.
That's precisely why you're here.

34:32.235 --> 34:36.263
See, Terri and I,
we have some merchandise
that we'd like to sell.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.467
Open, open, open.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.534
Some bank certificates.

34:40.610 --> 34:45.241
Now, there's a man
in Chicago named Mr. Cronin
who would like to buy them,

34:45.315 --> 34:49.946
but we're afraid of approaching him
because we don't know if he's
being watched by the police.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.284
Now, my question is...

34:52.356 --> 34:54.347
is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

34:57.795 --> 34:59.786
I don't know.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.200
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>Marathon Man</i>, Mr. Monk?

35:08.272 --> 35:12.868
No. Is it good?
Let's watch.
Let's- Let's watch it now.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.436
I'm not much of a movie guy,

35:16.514 --> 35:19.142
but I have some time now.

35:19.217 --> 35:22.277
Who's in it?
Who's in that?

35:22.353 --> 35:24.719
You're not gonna <i>watch</i> it.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.485
You're gonna live it.

35:29.827 --> 35:32.295
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
Yes or no?

35:32.363 --> 35:34.297
I don't know.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.299
I wish I did. L- l-

35:36.367 --> 35:40.064
I really wish I did.
I wish I did.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.471
- Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?
- No!

35:43.541 --> 35:45.475
[Sobbing]

35:45.543 --> 35:48.808
Is he under surveillance?
Yes. Okay. Yes.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.814
Yes.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.680
We know-We know all about him.

35:53.751 --> 35:56.481
You-You have to be careful.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.545
You should be careful.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.251
Now I really wish I could
believe you, Mr. Monk.
[Screams]

36:01.325 --> 36:03.293
[Sobbing]

36:03.361 --> 36:05.921
Your teeth are perfect.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.932
I don't see a single cavity.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.934
[Whimpers]

36:11.002 --> 36:14.267
Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance?

36:14.338 --> 36:17.671
[Whimpers, Mumbles]

36:17.742 --> 36:19.676
He's not saying anything.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.338
Pass me the extractor, please.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.073
[Pinball Machine Dings]

36:28.252 --> 36:30.914
I still don't see what's wrong
with the Randy Disher Project.

36:30.988 --> 36:34.924
I never liked that name.
Even in high school.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.517
[Exhales]
Okay.

36:40.264 --> 36:43.961
Okay. What about
the Randy Disher Experience?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.196
How about Severe Tire Damage?

36:46.270 --> 36:49.933
Okay. How about Mellow Knights
with a "K"?

36:53.144 --> 36:56.580
I gotta say I'm leaning towards
the Randy Disher Experience.
<i>How about this?</i>

36:56.647 --> 36:59.172
I'm gonna open up a newspaper...

36:59.250 --> 37:02.117
and the first word I see,

37:02.186 --> 37:04.120
that's our name.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.122
Baghdad.

37:06.190 --> 37:09.489
That's good, actually.
I kinda like that.
<i>Baghdad.</i>

37:09.560 --> 37:11.824
Let me see that.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.729
"13 million in bearer bonds stolen."

37:17.868 --> 37:19.859
Bearer bonds. Barry Bonds.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.964
Not Barry Bonds.
They were saying "bearer bonds."

37:24.041 --> 37:28.501
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

37:30.147 --> 37:34.277
Your hands are so dirty.

37:34.352 --> 37:36.718
- Excuse me?
- Could you-

37:36.787 --> 37:39.449
You gotta wash your hands first.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.855
Please. Please.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.453
You want me to wash my hands.
Please.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.121
I'm not gonna wash my hands,
okay?
Please.

37:47.198 --> 37:50.361
I'm not washing my hands!
Okay, just hold still.
The sink's right over there.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.665
We're not animals here, right?
Please, I'm asking you.

37:53.738 --> 37:57.265
- I'm asking you!
- He did wash his hands
in <i>Marathon Man.</i>

37:57.341 --> 38:00.208
Don't give me "In <i>Marathon Man."</i>
I'm not gonna wash my hands
when I'm torturing him.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.714
It'll just take one second.
Please. I'm asking you!

38:03.781 --> 38:06.875
Look into your heart.
For the love of God,

38:06.951 --> 38:09.385
by all that's holy,
look into your heart.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.149
Look into your heart.
I'll wash my damn hands, okay?

38:12.223 --> 38:14.214
[Sobs]

38:17.528 --> 38:19.553
Look, the lights are on.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.795
No! That's the wrong soap.

38:28.873 --> 38:31.740
You gotta use
antibacterial soap.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.743
Give me the drill.
Gotta use the right soap.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.905
- This is enough already.
Just give me the drill.
- Not that soap!

38:36.981 --> 38:42.078
- [Whirring]
- [Screams, Moans]

38:42.153 --> 38:45.316
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- Drop the drill!
Step away from the chair!

38:45.389 --> 38:47.220
<i>[Randy]</i>
<i>Don't move, Natalie.</i>
<i>Stay there.</i>

38:47.291 --> 38:50.590
- Get over there.
- Down. Down on your knees now.
Both of you.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.391
- You okay?
- I don't have my cuffs.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.455
Here.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.271
<i>[Randy]</i>
<i>Your hands. Don't move.</i>
Mr. Monk? Oh, God. It's okay.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.830
- Oh, God. It's all over.
- Sorry.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.933
It's all over.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.916
## [Rock]

39:24.395 --> 39:28.058
# I don't need a gun
to make me feel strong #

39:28.132 --> 39:31.397
# I don't need a captain
shoot me down all day long #

39:31.469 --> 39:35.906
# I don't need your mustache
Don't you condescend to me #

39:35.973 --> 39:40.672
# I don't need nobody
'cause, baby, I am free #

39:42.480 --> 39:45.972
# No, I don't need nobody, baby #

39:46.050 --> 39:48.610
# I am free #

39:52.757 --> 39:54.850
## [Ends]

40:02.800 --> 40:06.634
Wow. That had some good energy.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.797
Yeah. A lot of energy.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.472
Let's watch it again some time.

40:12.543 --> 40:16.240
L-l-It doesn't matter.
The band broke up anyway.

40:16.313 --> 40:19.771
We couldn't agree on anything:
Name, what kind of music to play,

40:19.850 --> 40:22.944
or whether or not
I should shut up.

40:24.855 --> 40:26.789
Come here.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.723
I believe this is yours.

40:38.402 --> 40:40.700
Welcome back, Randy.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.399
Welcome back.
You okay?

40:43.474 --> 40:45.942
Mmm. Loose tooth.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.972
Betcha that happened
when they knocked him out.

40:50.047 --> 40:52.015
Oh, my gosh.
You gotta see a dentist.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.050
Mmm. No.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.053
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Mr. Monk,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.180
Mmm.
I'll be with you the whole time.

40:59.256 --> 41:02.248
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>
<i>What are the odds</i>
<i>of another dentist torturing you?</i>

41:02.326 --> 41:04.385
<i>Let's not talk about it anymore.</i>
