00:42.776 --> 00:44.245
( horn honking )

00:51.119 --> 00:52.753
( Louie )
It's very different raising
children in America.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.422
We get to make all
these weird decisions about

00:54.488 --> 00:57.525
what do we expose our kids
to when.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.494
Other countries,
they don't have a choice.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.064
Like, some parents at my kids'
school were talking about war

01:04.132 --> 01:05.533
and they're, like, "When do
we tell our kid--

01:05.599 --> 01:07.601
"Do we tell our children
that our country is at war

01:07.668 --> 01:09.437
"in Afghanistan
and these places ?

01:09.503 --> 01:12.140
When do we introduce this i--"

01:12.206 --> 01:14.608
Only in America,
we have this luxury,

01:14.675 --> 01:17.878
we get to decide when
they find out

01:17.945 --> 01:19.046
that there is--

01:19.113 --> 01:21.982
Kids in Afghanistan
don't have-- just--

01:22.049 --> 01:22.883
They find out.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.852
They find out.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.354
They find out
when they ask,

01:26.420 --> 01:30.224
"How come Uncle Henry's head
is gone now?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.126
"How come that happened?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.162
Oh, 'cause of the war."

01:37.165 --> 01:39.233
Life can be stressful here,
though,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.502
'cause life is good
and so we want it to be better

01:41.569 --> 01:44.037
and we get-- we try to perfect
everything in our lives

01:44.104 --> 01:45.005
and it's like a job.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.509
Being a consumer
is like a job.

01:48.576 --> 01:52.680
You have to make sure
you get the best one.

01:52.746 --> 01:56.150
If you get a Blu-ray player,
you gotta do research.

01:56.217 --> 02:01.189
You gotta look at
reviews of a player.

02:01.255 --> 02:05.726
You gotta go on Amazon and read
a really long review

02:05.793 --> 02:10.298
written by an insane person

02:10.364 --> 02:12.099
who's been dead
for months...

02:12.166 --> 02:16.003
( audience laughing )

02:16.069 --> 02:18.138
... because he shot
his wife

02:18.206 --> 02:21.209
and then himself

02:21.275 --> 02:24.545
after explaining to you

02:24.612 --> 02:27.181
that the remote is
counterintuitive.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.183
( audience laughing )

02:29.250 --> 02:31.652
"It's got really small buttons
on the remote,"

02:31.719 --> 02:33.521
he said...

02:33.587 --> 02:37.157
before he murder-suicided
his whole family.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.526
And now you're
reading it and going,

02:38.592 --> 02:40.861
"I don't know.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.198
"I don't know which one to get,
I don't know.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.866
I gotta get the best one."
Why?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.436
Who are you,
the king of Siam,

02:48.502 --> 02:51.972
that you should get
the best one ever?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.874
"I'm-- Bring me
the best DV..."

02:53.941 --> 02:55.609
Who cares?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.912
They're all the same,
these machines.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.715
They're all made from
the same Asian suffering.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.351
There's no difference.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.120
That was a good set.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.422
I guess, I don't...

03:08.489 --> 03:10.057
( man )
... a round of applause...

03:10.123 --> 03:10.724
Hey, Ross.
Hey, how's it going,
guys?

03:10.791 --> 03:12.293
Hey.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.094
This is my agent, Doug.
Hey, how's it going?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.496
Hey, Louie, great job.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.164
Thank you.
It was great.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.232
The order is terrific.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.667
I mean, the closing bit,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.101
Jay's gonna love
tomorrow night on the show.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.970
Oh, good.
It was just terrific.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.972
I'm sorry-- Louie,
great set, great set.
Hey, Bud, how are you?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.674
Thank you very much,
thank you.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.576
Um, but the great thing
is, also, it timed in at

03:28.642 --> 03:30.511
four minutes and 30 seconds,
which is the perfect

03:30.578 --> 03:32.513
amount of--
perfect amount of time.
Good.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.447
I mean, with the audience
reaction and everything else,

03:33.514 --> 03:35.649
it's just, for our studio,

03:35.716 --> 03:36.917
it's gonna be the time
that we're looking for.
That's great.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.051
Good, good, good.
So...

03:38.118 --> 03:39.587
Is Louie gonna
interview on panel?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.422
Tomorrow night,
Tom Cruise is the other guest

03:41.489 --> 03:43.891
and Tom loves to go long,
tells great stories

03:43.957 --> 03:46.294
and Jay's surprising him
tomorrow with a motorcycle.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.495
I'm gonna get bumped,
right?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.696
You're not gonna
get bumped, Louie.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.930
You're not going to
get bumped.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.532
Sounds like I'm--
Nah.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.633
You know what, I'll--
I'll see you tomorrow night.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.734
But thank you.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.536
Thanks, guys,
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.970
Okay, thanks, Ross,
thanks for coming.
Okay, okay.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.238
Okay, good.
Okay.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.641
I'm totally getting
bumped.
Yeah.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.376
I'm getting--
Sounds like--

04:02.443 --> 04:03.277
It's like they brought me
here to bump me,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.145
all the way...

04:05.212 --> 04:07.315
Getting bumped is not
that bad, Louie.
How is it not that bad?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.749
'Cause they advertise
your name,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.718
you still get paid
and then they have you back on.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.152
Just...

04:12.219 --> 04:14.322
Okay, thank you,
thanks, Doug.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.331
Amazing, this face work.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.332
Look at this.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.467
Look at "before"...

04:26.534 --> 04:27.735
and look at "after."

04:27.801 --> 04:29.370
Boy, just,
you know, I think...

04:31.038 --> 04:33.841
You know the real
trick here?

04:33.907 --> 04:35.576
I think the real trick here
is, don't be pissed off.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.811
You look better.
( sighing )

04:37.878 --> 04:39.313
( knocking )

04:39.380 --> 04:41.114
I'm here to
mic you.
( Louie )
Sure.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.983
Just turn around for me.
Oh, sorry.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.986
( Jay )
...some of that delicious
Velveeta juice.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.655
Yeah!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.189
Folks, we'll be right back
with Tom Cruise

04:49.256 --> 04:51.058
right after this.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.793
( cheers and applause )

04:55.929 --> 04:57.765
Okay, where's your jacket?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.767
I don't have--
This is what I'm wearing.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.001
Oh.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.302
You're all set then.
Okay.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.642
Hey, what's going on?

05:08.709 --> 05:09.810
I got some
really bad news.

05:09.877 --> 05:10.811
You're bumping me.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.513
Shit, I knew this.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.314
No, not exactly,
I'm not bumping you.
You're not?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.983
What's--

05:16.049 --> 05:17.317
Ross, you tell him?
I haven't told him yet.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.319
Louie, are you ready?

05:19.387 --> 05:22.122
Tom Cruise
is not coming tonight.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.491
What do you mean,
he's not coming?
So...
No, he's not coming.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.493
He hates surprises

05:25.559 --> 05:26.860
and the whole motorcycle
thing, he just-- he just--

05:26.927 --> 05:28.261
It doesn't matter
why he canceled,

05:28.328 --> 05:29.563
he's not coming, okay?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.098
He's not here,
you are.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.332
You're on
lead guest, okay?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.233
We need you to lead off
the show.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.535
Now?
Yes, now.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.870
Okay.
I can do some
questions for him.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.706
I could
give him stories.
We don't have time to
analyze this.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.173
You're a comic,
you know how to talk.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.642
All right, here's your
chance, all right.
All right.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.776
You ever flown on
an airplane?
Yeah, sure.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.645
You got airplane stories?
I can do a--

05:44.712 --> 05:45.846
All right,
tell an airplane story.
Okay, that's fine.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.147
You all right, you good?
Yeah, I'm ready.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.649
All right, good,
see you out there.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.650
Okay, thanks.
Come on, let's go,
let's go.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.884
You're on!
Okay, okay, okay.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.085
Right now?
Okay, all right.
Yeah, now!

05:58.125 --> 05:59.893
Hey, everybody,
welcome back.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.763
Now, folks, as I...

06:02.830 --> 06:05.699
as I told you, we had Tom Cruise
booked on the show tonight,

06:05.766 --> 06:07.134
but...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.135
( cheers and applause )

06:08.201 --> 06:09.302
Well-- Yes, yes.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.973
Well... this is...

06:13.040 --> 06:14.542
this is live television

06:14.608 --> 06:16.777
and sometimes things
happen in live television,

06:16.844 --> 06:20.313
and... Tom Cruise
is not here.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.552
( crowd booing )

06:24.618 --> 06:26.420
All right, all right,
I don't know why.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.955
Okay, Louie, listen,

06:28.021 --> 06:29.790
you're going immediately
to your right, okay?

06:29.857 --> 06:30.758
And as soon
as you get to your right,

06:30.824 --> 06:31.792
Jay will greet you,
got it?

06:31.859 --> 06:32.893
Okay.
Are you listening to me?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.995
...get here--
I don't know what it was.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.298
Anyway, we have to do a show
and I already did my jokes,

06:38.365 --> 06:39.733
so what I'm gonna do
is bring out the comic

06:39.800 --> 06:41.068
who was gonna close the show
tonight.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.570
We're gonna give him a shot,

06:42.636 --> 06:44.137
he's gonna be my very first
guest tonight.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.673
He's a very funny man,

06:45.739 --> 06:46.640
he'll be at
the Comedy Cellar in New York.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
Go out there
and go get 'em.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.743
Okay?
( coughing )

06:49.810 --> 06:50.811
( Jay )
Louie C.K., Louie!

06:50.878 --> 06:52.279
Don't swear!

06:52.345 --> 06:55.683
( cheers and applause )

06:57.317 --> 06:58.486
Good to see you.
Hey, how are you?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.523
Have a seat.
Uh... thanks.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.668
( cell phone ringing )

07:19.439 --> 07:21.875
( phone continues ringing )

07:25.178 --> 07:31.519
( multiple phones ringing )

07:40.393 --> 07:41.895
Hello?
( cell phone ringing )

07:41.962 --> 07:44.197
( woman )
Sir, this is housekeeping.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.833
What?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.568
You have a "do not disturb"
sign on your door.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.102
When do you want us
to clean your room?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.973
I have a "do not disturb"
sign on the door,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.141
that's the answer.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.843
Just don't do this
to me.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.846
When do you
want us to clean?

07:58.912 --> 08:02.349
What's the point of the sign
if you don't...

08:02.415 --> 08:03.817
What...

08:03.884 --> 08:07.154
This is the opposite
of what it says.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.488
You understand that?

08:08.556 --> 08:09.857
When do you want us
to clean?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.392
Just don't ever clean it
here ever again.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.561
I don't know.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.229
Oh...

08:19.032 --> 08:20.601
Shit on a dick.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.519
( sighing )

08:42.222 --> 08:44.124
( groaning )

08:47.227 --> 08:49.129
Oh... shit.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.132
Bitch.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.271
( burping )

09:06.213 --> 09:07.280
Damn.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.051
Wow.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.085
What the hell?

09:17.457 --> 09:19.292
( cell phone ringing )

09:22.062 --> 09:23.697
Hey, Doug.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.833
Louie, Jesus, I've been
trying to reach you.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.669
What-- what is this--
What's wrong?

09:28.736 --> 09:31.004
Did you see that
you went viral today?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.005
I'm what?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.741
Your set from last night,
it...

09:33.807 --> 09:35.508
You got a million
hits already online.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.778
It was huge.
Wow.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.247
Listen, you have a meeting
at CBS in one hour.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.115
I have-- What?
At a what?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.617
The who?
What?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.819
You have a meeting at
CBS in one hour.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.088
Doug, I didn't tell you

09:48.155 --> 09:49.923
to set any meetings
for me today.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.024
What the hell
is this about?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.592
I don't know,
they called me.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.929
You have a meeting with
the chairman, president,

09:55.996 --> 09:57.998
whatever, of CBS
in one hour.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.800
Please, get up,
get dressed and meet me there.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.334
They're sending a car
for you.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.803
Okay, I got it.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.942
( cell phone beeping )
Shit.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.084
There's not even time to
jerk off, for Christ's sakes.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.196
Who are we here
to see?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.098
Do you have any idea?

10:31.164 --> 10:33.100
They didn't tell you
the name of the guy?
I don't know, no.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.168
You didn't find out
who we're--
No, I have no idea.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.943
Excuse me,
can you please tell us

10:43.010 --> 10:44.377
who we're here
to see?

10:52.786 --> 10:53.987
( phone beeping )

10:55.322 --> 10:57.024
Hello?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.292
Thank you,
I'll tell him.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.861
You can go in now.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.538
Louie.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.006
Come in.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.208
Hi.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.676
Sit down, sit down.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.450
So...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.252
you know who I am?

11:25.318 --> 11:28.088
Yes, I-- yeah, I do.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.423
Oh, this is my agent,
Doug.
It's an honor to meet--

11:30.490 --> 11:33.126
You're in from New York.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.162
Yeah.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.363
Have you been there?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.231
I'm from the Bronx.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.233
Oh, yeah, the Bronx?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.736
I-- I-- I haven't spent--
I haven't spent much--

11:42.803 --> 11:44.471
Whatever.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.508
You were very funny last night
on "The Tonight Show."

11:48.575 --> 11:51.378
Oh, thank you.
Very funny.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.747
Must have been under
a lot of pressure, too.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.349
Yeah, I didn't have much time
to think about it.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.220
What I'm about to tell you,
nobody knows,

12:00.287 --> 12:03.690
but it has the potential
to change your whole life.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.425
Okay.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.895
It's privileged information.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.097
Cannot leave this room.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.469
Send Charlie in,
uh, please.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.074
Carnegie Deli.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.476
I used to go there when I was
starting out in New York.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.181
Is that the thing I'm not
supposed to tell anybody?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.616
( chuckling )

12:29.682 --> 12:31.785
No.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.354
This is Charlie
from our legal department.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.295
What is this?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.131
These are confidentiality
agreements.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.765
You're signing
a document that states

12:45.833 --> 12:48.201
if you repeat anything
that is told to you

12:48.268 --> 12:51.972
by the chairman of the
Columbia Broadcasting System,

12:52.039 --> 12:55.775
you will be subject to penalties
and litigation.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.945
Okay.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.412
I don't-- I don't know
if I want to sign this.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.848
Then leave the room!

13:09.756 --> 13:10.991
Thank you.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.032
I'm the chairman.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.871
There won't be somebody else
here next month.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.006
I'll be here.
Yes, sir.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.845
David Letterman
is retiring.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.447
This is his last
year on "The Late Show."

13:34.514 --> 13:38.318
David Letterman's been
at CBS for 20 years.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.387
It's over.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.655
I have to replace him.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.324
I brought you here
to ask you

13:44.391 --> 13:47.427
if you'd be
interested in the job.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.305
No.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.440
No?
What...

14:00.507 --> 14:01.774
Why not?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.944
Well, that...

14:04.011 --> 14:06.113
I mean, that's crazy.
I'm not that guy.

14:06.179 --> 14:10.083
I'm 44 and I'm--
I mean, he's...

14:10.150 --> 14:12.953
You should get Jerry Seinfeld
or somebody, right?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.755
Oh, we're getting
Jerry Seinfeld.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.257
You are?

14:17.324 --> 14:19.792
You misunderstood me,
son.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.995
I'm not
offering you the job,

14:22.062 --> 14:25.565
I'm asking if you're
interested in it.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.967
Uh...

14:27.034 --> 14:29.836
We're negotiating
with Jerry Seinfeld.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.639
I'm looking for
an option.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.374
An option?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.576
Here, let me lay it out
for you.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.247
Jerry Seinfeld
is a slam dunk,

14:40.313 --> 14:45.218
but he's a $12 million
slam dunk at best.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.687
You, I could
get for a million,

14:47.754 --> 14:49.756
a little less, maybe.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.959
So.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.827
You're thinking.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.963
I see the wheels
turning.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.764
Tell-- tell me, what?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.599
Well, I just never
saw this--

14:59.666 --> 15:01.468
I didn't
see this coming.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.869
I don't know--

15:02.936 --> 15:04.071
I don't know how much
you know about me.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.940
I know you're
a working-class standup

15:07.007 --> 15:08.775
from Boston.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.744
You do standup,
you make, maybe,

15:11.811 --> 15:14.914
$80,000 a year on
the club dates,

15:14.982 --> 15:17.517
but you're on
the back nine of your career.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.787
Except for, once in a while,
a special on cable,

15:20.853 --> 15:22.155
I think you--

15:22.222 --> 15:24.224
Five years ago,
you probably peaked

15:24.291 --> 15:25.925
and now you're waiting around

15:25.993 --> 15:28.161
wondering if
something's gonna happen

15:28.228 --> 15:30.697
before it gets
embarrassing.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.665
Am I right?

15:38.371 --> 15:40.507
You don't think
you can do it.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.377
You think it's over
and you're afraid to try.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.646
I mean, I get it,
that's normal.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.081
I've seen it.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.318
And I've seen it
turn around.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.920
Let me offer
you a proposal.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.722
You go back to
New York.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.990
You get in shape.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.026
You lose about
40 pounds.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.162
I get you with Jackie Dahl,
he's my main city man.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.432
He works with you
and then, in about two months,

16:05.498 --> 16:08.001
we do a test show.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.037
A test show?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.039
Jack'll get you
a small studio.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.973
You know, you'll do
a monologue,

16:14.041 --> 16:15.642
you'll do
a couple of interviews

16:15.708 --> 16:18.911
and if the test
is good...

16:18.978 --> 16:20.580
I'll put you
on the air.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.384
And then if you're a hit,

16:24.451 --> 16:27.120
everybody'll think
I'm a genius

16:27.187 --> 16:28.621
and I'll have
saved the network

16:28.688 --> 16:31.958
about $12 million.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.961
If America
hates you...

16:35.028 --> 16:37.397
no one's gonna blame me.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.933
We'll hire Jerry Seinfeld
to do the show.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.503
No harm, no foul.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.373
But you'll take
the heat on all that.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.975
You're gonna crack your head
on the ceiling

16:49.042 --> 16:50.677
and you're
gonna go down,

16:50.743 --> 16:51.711
probably for good.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.417
Look, Louie.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.252
We're talking about
the big game here,

16:59.319 --> 17:03.090
so forgive me
if I use big terms.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.325
Here's the reality.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.594
In ten years, you're
gonna be teaching comedy

17:07.660 --> 17:10.597
at a community college
to support your kids

17:10.663 --> 17:11.898
and falling asleep to

17:11.964 --> 17:16.136
"The Late Show with
Jerry Seinfeld."

17:16.203 --> 17:19.172
You're circling failure...

17:19.239 --> 17:22.409
in a rapidly
decaying orbit.

17:22.475 --> 17:26.646
That's the reality,
as we talk now.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.916
But you can change that.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.253
It's in your power
to change that.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.787
Yes, you'll
have to work hard,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.556
you'll have to do things
you haven't done before

17:36.623 --> 17:38.158
and still...

17:38.225 --> 17:40.993
your chances
are very slim.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.497
But you could
change it.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.434
I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.271
David Letterman
is retiring.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.072
Do you want his job?
