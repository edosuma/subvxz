WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.963
LOIS: I can't believe you,

00:02.002 --> 00:03.963
Dewey! How could you do this?!

00:04.004 --> 00:05.213
When is she

00:04.004 --> 00:05.213
going to stop?

00:05.255 --> 00:07.925
I'm starving.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.925
Go get us some food.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.510
I'm not going

00:07.967 --> 00:09.510
out there.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.553
LOIS: That's right,

00:09.551 --> 00:11.553
you better cry!

00:11.595 --> 00:13.639
Sorry doesn't

00:11.595 --> 00:13.639
cut it, young man!

00:13.681 --> 00:15.307
This was a good idea.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.100
Just wish you had

00:15.349 --> 00:17.100
told me earlier.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.060
I was hiding outside

00:17.142 --> 00:19.060
for 45 minutes

00:19.102 --> 00:20.061
before I came in.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.063
I saw you.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.357
Boys, you know how you've

01:03.230 --> 01:05.357
been hounding us for years

01:05.399 --> 01:06.942
for your own computer?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.485
Well, your mother and

01:06.984 --> 01:08.485
I have arranged a deal

01:08.527 --> 01:10.111
with our nice neighbor

01:08.527 --> 01:10.111
Ed to get you one.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.989
I'm giving you

01:10.153 --> 01:11.989
my old laptop.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.493
Is it inside that?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.328
Nope, that's it.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.328
And in exchange,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.915
you're going to help Ed

01:18.370 --> 01:20.915
set up his new computer.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.499
It shouldn't be hard

01:20.956 --> 01:22.499
for a smart kid like you.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.710
All you have to do is install

01:22.541 --> 01:24.710
the sound and graphics card

01:24.752 --> 01:26.336
and set up a wireless network

01:24.752 --> 01:26.336
for my broadband connection,

01:26.378 --> 01:27.838
and I'm good to go.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.339
And, Reese, you're

01:27.880 --> 01:29.339
going to help him

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
resod his lawn

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
and build a gazebo.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.342
What?! No!

01:32.384 --> 01:33.635
Come on, boys.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.387
Nothing in this life

01:33.677 --> 01:35.387
comes free.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.348
Oh, Hal, here are

01:35.429 --> 01:38.348
those Foreigner albums.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.642
Pleasure doing

01:38.390 --> 01:40.642
business with you.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.230
Oh, just be glad

01:42.853 --> 01:45.230
you're getting a computer.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.524
Maybe I should get a dog

01:45.272 --> 01:47.524
or a rat.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.360
Some dumb animal that at least

01:47.566 --> 01:50.360
knows how to work for a living!

01:50.402 --> 01:52.153
Yes, ma'am.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.156
Damn idiots never learned

01:52.195 --> 01:55.156
how to do one damn thing right

01:55.198 --> 01:56.658
your entire lives!

01:56.700 --> 01:59.160
Yes, ma'am.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.788
And the blood

01:59.202 --> 02:00.788
from my knees

02:00.829 --> 02:02.414
was tracking behind where

02:00.829 --> 02:02.414
I had already scrubbed

02:02.456 --> 02:04.374
so I had to keep going

02:02.456 --> 02:04.374
around and around

02:04.416 --> 02:06.585
until finally she let me

02:04.416 --> 02:06.585
put dish towels

02:06.627 --> 02:07.753
on my knees.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.046
So, how was your day?

02:09.088 --> 02:10.171
Did you make a lot

02:09.088 --> 02:10.171
of snow globes?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.966
I don't care about that.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.175
My husband is being disrespected

02:12.007 --> 02:14.175
by a woman who isn't fit

02:14.217 --> 02:16.261
to eat the crap

02:14.217 --> 02:16.261
between your toes.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.055
Someone ought to cut

02:16.303 --> 02:18.055
that woman's belly open

02:18.097 --> 02:21.058
with a rusty knife and strangle

02:18.097 --> 02:21.058
her with her own entrails.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.644
I love you, too.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.981
If you want me,

02:24.937 --> 02:26.981
I'll be under my bed.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.649
Oh, come on, Dewey,

02:27.022 --> 02:28.649
it wasn't that bad.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.691
It was terrible!

02:29.733 --> 02:31.192
I hate soccer.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.235
I stink!

02:32.277 --> 02:33.904
My team stinks.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.990
Well, 27-0 doesn't

02:33.946 --> 02:35.990
reflect how close

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
the first five minutes

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
of the game were.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.869
Hey, you guys won

02:39.242 --> 02:40.869
the coin toss.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.496
I want to quit.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.496
Well, you can't quit.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.248
People don't just quit because

02:42.537 --> 02:45.248
they lose a couple games.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.708
The coach quit.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.209
No, he had an emotional

02:46.750 --> 02:48.209
breakdown.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.377
That's not the same thing.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.090
The point is,

02:49.419 --> 02:53.090
you're not quitting.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.508
In fact, you know what?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.135
I'm going to coach you.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.469
What?!

02:56.175 --> 02:57.469
Well, sure!

02:57.511 --> 02:58.720
This'll be great.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.097
It'll give us a chance

02:58.762 --> 03:00.097
to hang out,

03:00.139 --> 03:01.222
spend a little time together,

03:01.264 --> 03:02.891
kick the ball around.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.727
And who knows, someday

03:02.933 --> 03:05.727
you might just look back

03:05.769 --> 03:09.230
and say, "Boy, I sure had

03:05.769 --> 03:09.230
some fun with my old man."

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607
(chuckles)

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607
What do you say?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.317
No!

03:10.649 --> 03:12.317
Dewey, you are not

03:12.359 --> 03:13.401
quitting the team.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.236
I am going

03:13.443 --> 03:15.236
to coach you

03:15.278 --> 03:18.239
and we are going to create

03:15.278 --> 03:18.239
treasured father-son memories

03:18.281 --> 03:20.199
whether you want to or not.

03:21.326 --> 03:26.081
So, what's... on the...

03:21.326 --> 03:26.081
hard drive?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.749
Nothing.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.749
He erased everything.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.417
No, he just

03:27.791 --> 03:29.417
thinks he did.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.252
He may have deleted

03:29.459 --> 03:31.252
all the programs,

03:31.294 --> 03:32.754
but he didn't

03:31.294 --> 03:32.754
format the drive.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.423
They never... do.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.258
There it is.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.136
Let's check out

03:37.300 --> 03:39.136
what he's got in here.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.261
Let's go through

03:39.178 --> 03:40.261
his e-mails.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.181
Why? It's Ed.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.099
What's he going to...?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.143
Oh, my God.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.104
"Eddie, last night

03:46.185 --> 03:49.104
was amazing.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.439
You touched me places

03:49.146 --> 03:51.439
my husband never knew existed."

03:51.481 --> 03:52.858
"TGoodwin."

03:52.900 --> 03:55.276
That's Mrs. Goodwin

03:52.900 --> 03:55.276
from down the block.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.528
That's horrible.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.113
They're both married.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.280
And fat.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.949
Look at this one.

04:00.991 --> 04:04.119
"Edward, just saying your name

04:00.991 --> 04:04.119
turns me to jelly."

04:04.161 --> 04:07.081
That's... Mrs. Fisher.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.333
Mrs. Conlin, Mrs. Wilson,

04:07.122 --> 04:10.333
Mrs. Beltz...

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
He's sleeping with half the

04:10.375 --> 04:12.377
women in this neighborhood.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.462
Here's one from old

04:12.419 --> 04:14.462
Mrs. Swanbeck.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.591
Open the picture

04:14.504 --> 04:17.591
attachment.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.762
(all groan)

04:21.803 --> 04:23.471
(whistle blows)

04:23.513 --> 04:24.681
All right, kids,

04:23.513 --> 04:24.681
let's huddle up.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.766
Huddle up.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.766
Come on.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.142
Hello there.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.309
My name is Hal.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.978
I'm the new coach.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.521
Now, I don't claim

04:30.020 --> 04:31.521
to know a lot

04:31.563 --> 04:35.316
about soccer, but I do know

04:31.563 --> 04:35.316
about being a young boy.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.736
And growing up can be tough.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.031
I know what it's like

04:37.778 --> 04:41.031
to be the class spaz...

04:41.073 --> 04:42.699
the fat kid...

04:42.741 --> 04:44.701
the nose picker.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.204
Just wipe it on the grass, son.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.330
But together,

04:47.246 --> 04:49.330
we are more than that.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
And today we're going

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
to find out

04:51.041 --> 04:52.417
what it's like to be a team!

04:52.459 --> 04:54.335
Can we just forfeit

04:52.459 --> 04:54.335
and get a burger

04:54.377 --> 04:55.963
before the line gets too long?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.338
No.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
What we're going to do

04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
is go out on that field

04:59.424 --> 05:01.218
and we are going

04:59.424 --> 05:01.218
to have some fun.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.427
MAN: You kids

05:01.260 --> 05:02.427
make me sick!

05:02.469 --> 05:04.345
If you're not puking

05:02.469 --> 05:04.345
from exhaustion,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.598
you're not playing

05:04.387 --> 05:06.598
hard enough!

05:06.640 --> 05:07.975
It's a beautiful day.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.351
Let's go out

05:08.016 --> 05:10.351
and enjoy the sunshine

05:10.393 --> 05:11.812
and play some soccer!

05:11.853 --> 05:13.939
You will rip

05:11.853 --> 05:13.939
their heads off!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.356
Do you hear me?!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.356
(sobbing)

05:15.398 --> 05:17.192
Now stop crying.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.944
Stop crying,

05:17.234 --> 05:18.944
you little baby!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.196
Hey, fella, why don't

05:18.986 --> 05:21.196
you just ease up!

05:21.238 --> 05:22.948
Come on,

05:21.238 --> 05:22.948
they're just kids.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.365
You hear that, men?

05:24.407 --> 05:27.327
That's what a loser

05:24.407 --> 05:27.327
sounds like.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.289
All right, what do you say,

05:30.330 --> 05:33.416
we go out and give it our best

05:30.330 --> 05:33.416
and have some fun?!

05:33.458 --> 05:34.626
(boys groaning)

05:34.668 --> 05:37.378
It was 48 to nothing

05:34.668 --> 05:37.378
before the half.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.672
I had to call it.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.381
Of course.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.551
TEAM: Two, four, six, eight!

05:40.423 --> 05:43.551
Who did we annihilate?!

05:43.593 --> 05:45.762
The Tigers!

05:45.804 --> 05:47.889
We killed the Tigers!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.725
(cheering)

05:52.227 --> 05:53.561
Hey, Stevie.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.397
You were supposed...

05:53.603 --> 05:56.397
to meet me...

05:56.439 --> 05:57.649
at the library.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.067
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
You know, I actually found

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
something decent

06:01.111 --> 06:02.070
on Ed's computer.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.031
The Virts?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
Yeah, you create

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
a virtual family,

06:05.824 --> 06:07.201
put them in

06:05.824 --> 06:07.201
different situations,

06:07.242 --> 06:08.576
and the computer

06:07.242 --> 06:08.576
plays out their lives.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.287
I'm putting in

06:08.618 --> 06:10.287
the characters right now.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.663
Is that...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.832
your mom?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.125
Not yet.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.920
Reese.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.719
Make sure... you capture...

06:25.760 --> 06:28.930
the blackness of his soul.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.099
Aggressiveness-- ten.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.809
Hygiene-- zero.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.435
Okay, now me.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.729
Malcolm.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.106
Appearance-- nine.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.440
No, ten.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.525
A ten for

06:39.482 --> 06:40.525
intelligence.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.154
And social skills... ten.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.490
Too bad...

06:44.196 --> 06:47.490
it doesn't go... higher.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.869
I have social skills,

06:47.532 --> 06:50.869
jackass!

06:50.911 --> 06:53.372
Okay, it's dinnertime.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.456
(video game music playing)

06:58.960 --> 07:00.087
Where's Malcolm?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.757
Looking at himself

07:00.128 --> 07:03.757
in the mirror.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.137
How you doing?

07:09.179 --> 07:10.347
I'm hot and I'm bored.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.472
What is this stuff?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.141
It smells awful.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.685
What are you doing?

07:15.727 --> 07:18.105
There's bare patches

07:15.727 --> 07:18.105
all over the place.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.357
Are you even paying attention

07:18.146 --> 07:20.357
to what you're doing?

07:20.399 --> 07:21.566
Hey, I get grounded plenty, Ed.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.484
I know how to do grunt work.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.405
So why don't you just go fix

07:23.526 --> 07:26.405
Mrs. Conlin's "garage door"

07:26.446 --> 07:27.488
and get off my back!

07:27.530 --> 07:29.366
What did you say?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.366
You heard me.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.492
Oh, my God.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.492
What do you know?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.911
Everything.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.495
You might want to formulate

07:32.953 --> 07:34.495
your megabytes

07:34.537 --> 07:35.914
next time

07:34.537 --> 07:35.914
you get rid of your computer.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.291
Oh, and by the way,

07:37.332 --> 07:39.500
Mrs. Swanbeck? You are sick.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.961
Keep your voice down.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.422
Look, it's not my fault.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.173
I try to be faithful,

07:45.215 --> 07:48.176
but the women on this block

07:45.215 --> 07:48.176
are just so desperate

07:48.218 --> 07:49.510
and lonely.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.889
It's like I cast

07:49.552 --> 07:52.889
some kind of spell.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.724
I try to tell them no,

07:54.766 --> 07:56.517
but it always leads

07:54.766 --> 07:56.517
to a back rub.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.520
I know, Ed. I read all about it.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.522
Is that you, Ed?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.817
I'm a little busy

08:01.564 --> 08:03.817
right now, Martha.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.528
Look...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.114
you can't tell my wife.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.531
You can't tell anyone.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.699
Please.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.034
I'll do anything.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.786
I'll do anything you ask.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.539
I can work with that.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.208
Damn these loggers!

08:20.250 --> 08:21.918
Don't they know

08:20.250 --> 08:21.918
somebody's got to clean up

08:21.960 --> 08:23.544
their caribou carcass?

08:23.586 --> 08:26.381
These antlers won't

08:23.586 --> 08:26.381
fit down the disposal!

08:26.423 --> 08:28.049
Oh, hey, Francis,

08:26.423 --> 08:28.049
come away from there.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.801
You don't have

08:28.091 --> 08:29.801
to do that.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.804
You're much to valuable an

08:29.843 --> 08:32.804
employee to mess with that.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.556
But yesterday you said

08:32.846 --> 08:35.556
you'd seen tumors with hair

08:35.598 --> 08:36.975
that were smarter than me.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.977
Can't you tell

08:37.017 --> 08:38.977
good-natured ribbing?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.562
I got a more

08:39.019 --> 08:41.562
important job for you.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.564
Why don't you sit

08:41.604 --> 08:43.564
in that chair

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
and check out the reception

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
on the TV.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.152
It's been kind

08:45.608 --> 08:47.152
of spotty lately.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.447
Oh, and make sure these sodas

08:47.194 --> 08:50.447
haven't gone flat.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.616
That sounds... doable.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.286
We got other people

08:53.658 --> 08:56.286
to do the grunt work.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.788
A newlywed like you shouldn't

08:56.328 --> 08:58.788
be tiring himself out

08:58.830 --> 09:00.581
before he even gets home.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.918
Your lovely, young wife

09:00.623 --> 09:03.918
wouldn't like that, would she?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.589
What did you do?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.591
I don't know what

09:08.631 --> 09:10.591
you're talking about, honey.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.386
Lavernia is being

09:10.633 --> 09:12.386
nice to me.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.970
She's treating me

09:12.427 --> 09:13.970
like a human being!

09:14.012 --> 09:15.263
What did you do to her?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.182
Maybe she turned over

09:15.305 --> 09:17.182
a new leaf.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.892
Sometimes really big

09:17.224 --> 09:18.892
crappy jerks

09:18.933 --> 09:21.311
just realize they got

09:18.933 --> 09:21.311
to change their ways.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.603
This woman was terrified,

09:22.645 --> 09:24.647
and I've never seen

09:22.645 --> 09:24.647
her scared of anything.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.982
I don't know how

09:24.689 --> 09:25.982
you threatened her,

09:26.024 --> 09:27.442
but you must

09:26.024 --> 09:27.442
have said something.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.194
I wouldn't do

09:27.484 --> 09:29.194
that, Francis.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.611
You're the man.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
I'm not going to fight

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
your battles for you.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.614
Obviously that's not true.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.992
Now, damn it, you're

09:33.656 --> 09:35.992
going to tell me what you did!

09:36.034 --> 09:38.495
You know what?

09:38.537 --> 09:41.789
I don't have to do anything

09:38.537 --> 09:41.789
you tell me to do.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.626
And you might want to reconsider

09:41.831 --> 09:45.626
your tone of voice.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.506
Sometimes you

09:45.668 --> 09:49.506
make me so mad.

09:49.548 --> 09:52.551
(whistle blows)

09:52.592 --> 09:56.221
All right, look, uh,

09:52.592 --> 09:56.221
today's practice was...

09:56.263 --> 09:59.640
Well, let's-let's focus

09:56.263 --> 09:59.640
on the positive.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.561
I-I think it's encouraging

09:59.682 --> 10:02.561
that so many of you

10:02.602 --> 10:03.895
found the right field.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.565
And a special congratulations

10:03.937 --> 10:06.565
go to Billy

10:06.606 --> 10:08.649
for using the sidestep

10:06.606 --> 10:08.649
that we practiced

10:08.691 --> 10:13.654
to run away from the butterfly

10:08.691 --> 10:13.654
that almost landed near him.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.574
But we do need

10:13.696 --> 10:15.574
to work on

10:15.615 --> 10:19.286
your general unwillingness

10:15.615 --> 10:19.286
to kick the ball.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.703
It hurts!

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
Boys, if we are going

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
to get better,

10:22.705 --> 10:24.874
we're going to have

10:22.705 --> 10:24.874
to work together.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.586
We're going to have to start

10:24.916 --> 10:27.586
acting like a team.

10:27.627 --> 10:32.132
You know what it means

10:27.627 --> 10:32.132
to be on a team, don't you?

10:33.216 --> 10:34.968
Well, don't look at...

10:35.009 --> 10:37.137
Come on, think of a team.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.054
Like the X-Men?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.306
Yes!

10:39.347 --> 10:41.891
Yes! Yes, like the X-Men.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.685
You boys are like the X-Men.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.522
And what do the X-Men do?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.690
Fight evil?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.943
Yes, they work together.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.780
To fight evil

10:51.985 --> 10:55.780
and also to uphold the ideals

10:55.822 --> 10:59.618
of good sportsmanship

10:55.822 --> 10:59.618
and teamwork!

10:59.659 --> 11:00.701
And fight evil!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.496
(excited shouting)

11:02.537 --> 11:05.206
Yes! Okay, okay, boys.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.709
Come on, come on, come on,

11:05.248 --> 11:08.709
huddle up, huddle up.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
I should not be

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
telling you this,

11:10.753 --> 11:13.507
but the American Youth

11:10.753 --> 11:13.507
Soccer Federation

11:13.548 --> 11:15.716
has been infiltrated

11:13.548 --> 11:15.716
by evil forces

11:15.758 --> 11:18.553
hell-bent on total

11:15.758 --> 11:18.553
domination of the Earth.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.515
Now, the infiltration

11:18.595 --> 11:21.515
goes all the way down

11:21.556 --> 11:23.099
to the lowest levels.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.519
I'm talking the Blackhawks,

11:23.141 --> 11:25.519
the Bulldogs, the Eagles.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.104
Every other team in our league

11:28.146 --> 11:30.898
has been lost

11:28.146 --> 11:30.898
to the forces of evil.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.027
And it's up to you boys

11:30.940 --> 11:34.027
to stop them.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.737
Now, boys, what do you say, hmm?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.574
Who wants to be on the side

11:36.779 --> 11:39.574
of goodness and virtue

11:39.616 --> 11:42.743
and who wants to rid

11:39.616 --> 11:42.743
the world of evil?!

11:42.785 --> 11:44.204
(excited shouting)

11:44.245 --> 11:46.331
All right, boys!

11:46.373 --> 11:49.750
Now, let's get out there

11:46.373 --> 11:49.750
and do some kicking drills!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.753
(laughs)

11:52.795 --> 11:53.754
(sighs)

11:59.093 --> 12:02.138
Can you please...

11:59.093 --> 12:02.138
start working?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.181
Just one more second.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.558
This is really interesting.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.476
I just made my mom quit

12:04.599 --> 12:06.476
her crappy job

12:06.518 --> 12:08.019
and go to law school.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.230
It's less money, but her

12:08.061 --> 12:10.230
happiness level went way up.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.772
I made my dad quit, too.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.858
All he's doing is

12:11.814 --> 12:13.858
working on neighbors' cars,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.694
but check out

12:13.900 --> 12:15.694
his happiness level.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.487
(video game music playing)

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
But I still think

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
they could be happier.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.075
Let's send Reese to China.

12:22.116 --> 12:27.706
What are you changing...

12:22.116 --> 12:27.706
about Malcolm?

12:27.746 --> 12:28.873
Nothing, he's fine.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.585
He's burning himself...

12:31.626 --> 12:32.877
with a cigarette.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.296
Just a phase.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.632
(rock music playing)

12:40.051 --> 12:41.886
Where were you?

12:40.051 --> 12:41.886
(music stops)

12:41.928 --> 12:44.055
I've been waiting ten

12:41.928 --> 12:44.055
minutes for that lotion.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.099
Look at this.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.099
I am starting to freckle.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.808
Look, Reese,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.808
my wife gets back soon.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.603
I'm going to have a hard time

12:49.644 --> 12:51.979
explaining why I'm catering

12:49.644 --> 12:51.979
to a 15-year-old boy.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.981
I'll explain it to her

12:52.021 --> 12:53.981
if you want me to.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.609
That's okay,

12:54.023 --> 12:55.609
forget I mentioned it.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.611
Fly.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.611
Where?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.362
Just a drill.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.823
(rock music playing)

13:02.865 --> 13:05.826
Well, the oak

13:02.865 --> 13:05.826
seems to burn

13:05.868 --> 13:08.121
a few degrees hotter

13:05.868 --> 13:08.121
than the maple.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.207
(groans)

13:11.249 --> 13:13.126
This game is asinine!

13:13.167 --> 13:15.295
I thought you liked it.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.505
No, this is idiotic

13:15.336 --> 13:17.505
programming.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.090
My family has turned out

13:17.547 --> 13:19.090
horrible.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.467
My mom finished law school

13:20.508 --> 13:21.926
and became

13:20.508 --> 13:21.926
a Supreme Court justice,

13:21.968 --> 13:23.678
Reese is the king

13:21.968 --> 13:23.678
of China,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.012
and my dad is

13:23.720 --> 13:25.012
a millionaire

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
from his chain

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
of auto body shops.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.017
Why is Malcolm

13:26.889 --> 13:30.017
sneaking scotch

13:30.059 --> 13:31.852
from the toilet tank?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
He won't stop drinking!

13:33.271 --> 13:34.897
That's his second bottle

13:33.271 --> 13:34.897
since breakfast.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.900
I am so done with this game.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.570
No, you know what?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.863
I'm moving them all to Arkansas

13:40.612 --> 13:42.863
to become chicken farmers.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.617
That ought to level out

13:42.905 --> 13:45.617
the playing field.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.868
Hi, honey. This is great!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
You're home early.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.914
And you don't come home

13:49.912 --> 13:51.914
so mad anymore.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.793
I think we may

13:51.956 --> 13:54.793
have to split up.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.043
What?!

13:56.085 --> 13:58.045
I'm not sure

13:56.085 --> 13:58.045
this marriage is working.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.090
I mean, I love you,

13:58.087 --> 14:01.090
but I don't know you that well.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.551
Hell, I can't even pronounce

14:01.132 --> 14:03.551
your last name.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.886
Tan-nah-nah-ha-ahk-nah.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.305
And then with this

14:05.928 --> 14:07.305
whole Lavernia thing,

14:07.347 --> 14:08.723
I'm starting to think

14:07.347 --> 14:08.723
there's a side...

14:08.765 --> 14:10.266
I don't understand.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.059
If someone does something

14:10.308 --> 14:12.059
because they love someone

14:12.101 --> 14:13.770
and it solves

14:12.101 --> 14:13.770
the problem, then...

14:13.812 --> 14:15.271
No!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.939
Marriage is supposed to be

14:16.981 --> 14:20.318
about trust and communication

14:16.981 --> 14:20.318
and not being terrified!

14:21.528 --> 14:24.739
We're supposed to be a team,

14:21.528 --> 14:24.739
I thought.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.909
Look, I'm going

14:24.781 --> 14:28.909
to ask you one last time,

14:28.951 --> 14:32.079
for the sake of our marriage,

14:28.951 --> 14:32.079
what did you do?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.708
(mumbles):

14:32.121 --> 14:34.708
Took her parakeet.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.377
What?

14:34.749 --> 14:37.377
I took her parakeet!

14:37.418 --> 14:39.713
You stole the woman's pet?

14:39.754 --> 14:42.298
The woman's pet?!

14:42.340 --> 14:44.300
You protect the people

14:42.340 --> 14:44.300
that you love.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.344
I figured you'd do

14:44.342 --> 14:46.344
the same for me.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.721
But I would tell you!

14:47.762 --> 14:49.930
If I was going to grab

14:47.762 --> 14:49.930
someone's parakeet

14:49.972 --> 14:50.931
and hold it hostage...

14:50.973 --> 14:53.643
Well, gee, I wouldn't do that!

14:53.685 --> 14:55.603
How long were you going

14:53.685 --> 14:55.603
to keep it for, anyway?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.564
Till she behaved.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.940
And if she didn't,

14:57.605 --> 14:59.940
I guess I'd have killed it.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.236
See, that's where

14:59.982 --> 15:03.236
it gets alarming again.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.821
But putting aside

15:04.863 --> 15:06.614
the horrible nature

15:04.863 --> 15:06.614
of the act itself,

15:06.656 --> 15:08.742
what's really upsetting

15:06.656 --> 15:08.742
is that you made

15:08.783 --> 15:09.950
this unilateral decision.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.244
I said I was sorry!

15:11.285 --> 15:13.580
How many times do you

15:11.285 --> 15:13.580
want me to say it?!

15:13.621 --> 15:14.831
You didn't say you were...

15:14.873 --> 15:15.956
And what about you?

15:15.998 --> 15:17.375
You were going to

15:15.998 --> 15:17.375
break up with me!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.753
You think that

15:17.417 --> 15:19.753
makes me feel safe?

15:19.794 --> 15:21.421
You're right.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.922
I'm sorry.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.384
Wait! No!

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
I'm not apologizing here.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.888
We need to bring

15:28.302 --> 15:29.888
this bird back,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.014
and if I do it, she's

15:29.929 --> 15:32.014
going to think I was involved.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.558
You made this mess without me.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.851
You clean it up without me!

15:34.893 --> 15:36.811
Or what?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.689
Or maybe I'll do it for you!

15:40.481 --> 15:41.982
And you...

15:42.024 --> 15:46.028
have dinner ready

15:42.024 --> 15:46.028
when I get back!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.490
Look, Ed, school

15:47.947 --> 15:49.490
gets out at 3:00.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.991
It is 2:15.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.702
I've been waiting around

15:51.033 --> 15:52.702
for over an hour!

15:52.744 --> 15:54.161
Sorry, Reese.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.663
WOMAN:

15:54.203 --> 15:55.663
Excuse me.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.249
Damn, hurry up.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.249
Get in the car.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.668
Hello, I'm Mrs. Abbott,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.668
Reese's guidance counselor.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.003
I've been trying to talk

16:00.710 --> 16:03.003
to you about your son

16:03.045 --> 16:04.964
for the past three weeks.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.052
Well, I'm here now.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.052
What can I do for you?

16:13.055 --> 16:15.516
You have to stop this.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.810
Stupid game!

16:16.851 --> 16:18.018
This is ridiculous!

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
Everybody in my family

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
is, like, perfect.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.397
My mom is president,

16:21.439 --> 16:23.107
Reese is married

16:21.439 --> 16:23.107
to six supermodels,

16:23.149 --> 16:24.901
and my dad used

16:23.149 --> 16:24.901
all his money

16:24.943 --> 16:26.986
to fund a search for

16:24.943 --> 16:26.986
extraterrestrials.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
Nothing I do

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
has any effect whatsoever.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.326
If I give them money,

16:31.073 --> 16:33.326
if I take it away,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.411
if I make them ugly,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.411
if I make them Canadian,

16:35.453 --> 16:37.330
everything works out

16:35.453 --> 16:37.330
beautifully for them

16:37.371 --> 16:39.874
and horrible for me!

16:39.916 --> 16:42.502
Dewey just became Pope.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.211
And I weigh 500 pounds.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.339
That's it.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.842
I'm just going to have

16:46.380 --> 16:48.842
to kill them.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.887
Go to counter, get knife,

16:48.883 --> 16:52.887
kill them.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.263
No!

16:54.305 --> 16:56.056
Don't make yourself a sandwich!

16:56.098 --> 16:58.476
Kill! Kill!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.269
No, not yourself!

17:00.311 --> 17:02.856
Don't kill. Don't kill.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.483
You stupid fat bastard!

17:11.489 --> 17:12.699
(groans)

17:15.618 --> 17:18.830
(grunting)

17:21.541 --> 17:24.544
This means nothing!

17:24.585 --> 17:28.088
So, Dad,

17:24.585 --> 17:28.088
are you going to ground me?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.174
Boy, your counselor

17:28.130 --> 17:30.174
was furious.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.092
So how about we head back

17:30.216 --> 17:32.092
to your place,

17:32.134 --> 17:33.887
you can set up your Jacuzzi,

17:33.928 --> 17:36.472
and then you can throw something

17:33.928 --> 17:36.472
on the barbecue for me.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.182
I've got a better idea.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.977
I'll get in my Jacuzzi,

17:38.224 --> 17:40.977
and you'll fix dinner for me.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.102
What are you talking about?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
With the information

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
I just got on you,

17:44.146 --> 17:45.398
I can call your mother

17:45.439 --> 17:47.692
and you won't see

17:45.439 --> 17:47.692
daylight for years.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.318
Oh, yeah?

17:49.360 --> 17:52.030
One word, and I'm telling

17:49.360 --> 17:52.030
your wife your little secret.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.700
I guess the question is:

17:52.071 --> 17:55.700
am I more scared of my wife

17:55.742 --> 17:58.745
or are you more scared

17:55.742 --> 17:58.745
of your mother?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.582
Then get a dozen

18:00.162 --> 18:02.582
peach roses--

18:02.623 --> 18:04.542
they got to be peach--

18:04.584 --> 18:08.004
and run them over

18:04.584 --> 18:08.004
to Mrs. Malone's.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.218
Lavernia, I'm sorry.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.303
I just talked to my wife,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.303
and it turns out

18:16.345 --> 18:18.138
this was all a big

18:16.345 --> 18:18.138
misunderstanding.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.851
She's sorry, too,

18:18.180 --> 18:21.851
and we just want you to have...

18:23.603 --> 18:24.979
I guess I should have put

18:25.021 --> 18:27.648
a blanket on this

18:25.021 --> 18:27.648
on the way over.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.735
I just want you to know

18:27.690 --> 18:30.735
that I...

18:30.777 --> 18:34.321
(screaming)

18:34.363 --> 18:36.950
Okay, boys, look,

18:34.363 --> 18:36.950
we have come a long way,

18:36.991 --> 18:39.786
and today is the day we show

18:36.991 --> 18:39.786
what we're made of!

18:39.827 --> 18:41.746
Now, who are we?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.957
BOYS:

18:41.788 --> 18:43.957
The forces of good!

18:43.998 --> 18:45.332
And who's evil?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.167
BOYS:

18:45.374 --> 18:47.167
The Gophers!

18:47.209 --> 18:48.753
(cheering)

18:48.795 --> 18:50.254
We've got a schedule

18:48.795 --> 18:50.254
change, Coach.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.631
The Gophers didn't show up,

18:51.672 --> 18:53.215
so you're playing

18:51.672 --> 18:53.215
the Blackhawks again.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.842
(boys groan)

18:54.884 --> 18:57.887
Don't worry, I'll call it

18:54.884 --> 18:57.887
before it gets too ugly.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.597
We're playing

18:57.929 --> 18:59.597
the Blackhawks again?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.057
Boys, boys, listen to me.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.433
You're forgetting your mission.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.102
You're here to fight evil,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.854
and the Blackhawks

19:04.143 --> 19:06.854
are the most evil of all.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.189
You know when the teacher

19:06.896 --> 19:09.189
remembers to give you homework

19:09.231 --> 19:11.901
right before you're leaving

19:09.231 --> 19:11.901
school at the end of the day?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.193
The Blackhawks are behind it.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.236
When your mother says

19:14.278 --> 19:16.489
you can't watch TV,

19:14.278 --> 19:16.489
for no reason,

19:16.530 --> 19:19.199
the Blackhawks

19:16.530 --> 19:19.199
told her to say that.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.077
And when you didn't get

19:19.241 --> 19:21.077
the Christmas presents

19:21.119 --> 19:23.203
that you wanted,

19:21.119 --> 19:23.203
do you know who got them?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.204
The Blackhawks.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.414
If it were up to them,

19:25.456 --> 19:27.207
we wouldn't even have

19:25.456 --> 19:27.207
a Christmas.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.793
(boys gasp)

19:28.835 --> 19:31.504
I for one am glad

19:28.835 --> 19:31.504
that we have the chance to fight

19:31.545 --> 19:34.007
for what is right and good

19:31.545 --> 19:34.007
in this world!

19:34.048 --> 19:37.010
Now, I ask you boys,

19:34.048 --> 19:37.010
who are we going to beat?!

19:37.051 --> 19:38.302
BOYS:

19:37.051 --> 19:38.302
The Blackhawks!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.638
And what are they?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.638
BOYS: Evil!

19:40.680 --> 19:41.681
Yeah!

19:41.722 --> 19:43.016
Teams take the field!

19:43.057 --> 19:45.184
I love you boys.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.184
(chuckles)

19:46.268 --> 19:47.311
(sighs)

19:47.353 --> 19:49.647
I've done all the

19:47.353 --> 19:49.647
coaching I can do.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.565
The rest is up to them.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.444
(whistle blows)

19:57.279 --> 19:59.949
(boys yelling)

20:00.700 --> 20:02.201
No...

20:03.536 --> 20:06.497
♪ ♪

20:08.499 --> 20:11.502
Eat chalk, evildoer!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.462
Oh, my God.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.462
No.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.340
We couldn't stop them

20:13.504 --> 20:16.340
if we wanted to.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.472
So you just left

20:21.554 --> 20:23.472
the truck there

20:23.514 --> 20:24.974
and ran all the way home?

20:25.016 --> 20:26.893
Hey, you didn't see

20:25.016 --> 20:26.893
the look on her face.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.729
I'm kind of scared to even

20:26.934 --> 20:29.729
go into work tomorrow.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.690
You know, she does

20:29.770 --> 20:32.690
have a turtle.
