00:13.500 --> 00:15.189
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hello.</ I></i>

00:15.585 --> 00:17.899
<i>- Uh, yes?</i>
<i>- Who is this?</i>

00:18.504 --> 00:21.320
<i>- Who are you calling?</i>
<i>- Who am I speaking to?</ I></i>

00:21.424 --> 00:23.498
- Wrong number.
- Who was that?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.939
- Oh, nobody.
- Did you pick a movie?

00:26.356 --> 00:31.672
- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.
- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.

00:31.672 --> 00:35.155
It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.

00:35.155 --> 00:37.240
Why, angry feel.

00:38.283 --> 00:41.720
- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he
kills people very creatively.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.849
- But she don't give a shit who dies...

00:43.849 --> 00:48.824
...cos there's no character to fill a man. It's just
body parts whipping and blood spewing.

00:48.824 --> 00:50.000
- Who you keep texting?

00:50.040 --> 00:53.004
- I have a Facebook stalker. He
keeps leaving me messages.

00:53.004 --> 00:54.080
- Nah, like what?

00:54.120 --> 00:58.187
- Just stuff like: Hey, what's up?
You are hot. I want to kill you...

00:58.708 --> 01:02.919
- Well, delete him.
- I did it, but he hacked its way back in.

01:02.919 --> 01:08.696
- Or report him.
- He is really hot, tho. You wanna see?

01:13.138 --> 01:16.891
- That's Channing Tatum.
- It is not. Is it?

01:16.995 --> 01:20.862
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You were being punk'd.

01:27.943 --> 01:30.340
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Who is this?</ I></i>

01:30.445 --> 01:32.801
The more impatient version of
the person you just spoke to.

01:32.801 --> 01:37.462
<i>I am sorry. You don't have to be a bitch about it.</ I></i>
<i>- Of course I don't. Eat me.</i>

01:37.462 --> 01:41.000
- You hang up on me and I cut thru
your neck until I feel bone!</ I>

01:41.040 --> 01:41.704
- Who is it?

01:42.330 --> 01:43.727
It's for you.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.795
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Who is this?</ I></i>

01:48.900 --> 01:50.600
- It's Trudie. Who's this?

01:50.640 --> 01:54.425
- This is the last person you
ever gonna see alive.</ I>

01:54.425 --> 01:58.157
- It's a prank. Hang up.
- Why did you give the phone to me?

01:58.157 --> 02:01.504
- You are the one with a stalker.
- Are the doors locked?

02:01.504 --> 02:02.859
Don't freak out.

02:07.353 --> 02:10.271
Let it ring.

02:17.258 --> 02:21.052
It's from stalker boy. He said "Answer the phone".

02:21.740 --> 02:25.223
For God's sake, it's a joke Trudie.
It's probably Lexie or Karen.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.425
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.783
- No, don't open it.
- You're overreacting.

02:36.547 --> 02:41.717
It's a joke, Trudie, ok? Someone made a dummy
profile. They re just trying to scare you.

02:41.717 --> 02:43.594
Wait. Who is it?

02:45.616 --> 02:50.288
I said, who is it? Let's call the cops.

02:54.135 --> 02:59.681
"I dare you to open the door." No, Sherri,
don't. No, don't, I'm scared.

02:59.681 --> 03:04.029
It could be anyone that we know. Lisa, Bailey, Wayne.

03:04.029 --> 03:06.437
Or the hoped-for long shot, Channing Tatum.

03:24.297 --> 03:25.528
There is nobody out here.

03:30.450 --> 03:31.555
What is it say?

03:33.056 --> 03:35.964
It says "I'm not outside, I am right beside you."

03:38.895 --> 03:39.531
Trudie!

03:59.850 --> 04:02.656
- Fucking kidding me?
- What?

04:03.187 --> 04:08.045
That was so fucking stupid. Pure horse shit.
The death of horror right here in front of us!

04:08.045 --> 04:13.050
- I jumped. It scared me.
- A fucking Facebook killer? You re kidding me right?

04:13.676 --> 04:17.033
I guess now it would be Twitter. That'd make more sense.

04:17.033 --> 04:23.424
Under articulate teens sit around and deconstruct horror
movies until Ghostface kills them one by one.

04:23.726 --> 04:28.564
It's been done to death. The whole
self-aware post-modern meta-shit.

04:28.564 --> 04:31.004
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

04:32.047 --> 04:34.799
I like the Stab movies. They are scarier.

04:34.799 --> 04:38.344
It's not aliens or zombies or little Asian ghost girls.

04:38.344 --> 04:44.433
There is something real about a guy
with a knife who just ... snaps.

04:45.996 --> 04:51.751
- It can really happen.
- I can't do it. These people don't know when to stop.

04:51.751 --> 04:54.109
They just keep recycling the same shit.

04:54.630 --> 04:58.200
Even the opening scene, there is always
some random girl who gets a call that undoubtedly

04:58.240 --> 04:59.342
ends up getting her killed.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.073
It's all so predictable. There's no element of surprise.

05:02.073 --> 05:04.117
You can see everything coming.

05:10.154 --> 05:11.530
Did that surprise you?

05:16.347 --> 05:19.642
- Why?
- Because you talk too much.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.260
Now shut the fuck up and watch the movie.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.863
Oh my God. I love it.

05:33.863 --> 05:37.168
I've seen it five times, and it still gets me every time.

05:37.168 --> 05:45.488
- You re kidding? I don't get it.
- Ok, it's like the Twilight Zone.

05:45.488 --> 05:47.500
- Twilight zone...
- A movie within a movie.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.314
I get that. But it's illogical..

05:49.314 --> 05:54.153
It begs the question that if the beginning of Stab 7
is Stab 6 then it's the beginning of Stab 6 Stab 5?

05:54.153 --> 05:56.238
And if so, what is Stab 4 about?

05:56.238 --> 06:00.280
- You re over thinking it.- Am I or did you
ever make it, just under think it, there's

06:00.320 --> 06:02.076
a reason i don't watch these movies?

06:02.076 --> 06:05.797
I can't believe you haven't seen them. We live in Woodsboro.

06:06.643 --> 06:11.303
It has nothing to do with Woodsboro. I thought
you said Stab was based on true stories.

06:11.303 --> 06:14.817
The first three, the original trilogy
is based off of Sidney Prescott.

06:14.817 --> 06:19.165
But then she threatened to sue em if they used the
true story so they just started making stuff up.

06:19.165 --> 06:22.741
Stab 5 has time travel, which is by far the worst.

06:22.741 --> 06:25.960
- And don't you have enough
about this story every year?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.558
- At least Woodsboro is known for something.

06:30.601 --> 06:31.759
Did you hear that?

06:31.759 --> 06:35.273
Uh, no, I didn't hear anything.

06:36.211 --> 06:37.671
I did.

06:38.974 --> 06:41.528
Jenny, don't try to scare me.

06:41.528 --> 06:42.717
I am not trying to scare you.

06:42.717 --> 06:43.927
You do it all the time.

06:43.927 --> 06:45.219
No, I don't.

06:45.219 --> 06:46.397
Where are you going?

06:46.397 --> 06:48.170
I told you, I heard something.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.848
I know you re trying to scare me.

06:50.474 --> 06:51.756
I am not.

06:58.649 --> 06:59.660
What is it?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.517
I must have left the window in my room open.

07:06.686 --> 07:11.097
- Could you get that? Marnie?
- Yeah.

07:15.308 --> 07:19.000
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hello. Who is this?</i>

07:19.625 --> 07:21.430
Marnie. Who is this?

07:21.430 --> 07:25.714
This is the last person you ever gonna see alive.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.498
What?

07:32.146 --> 07:36.630
- I am sorry. I had to.
- You bitch!

07:37.121 --> 07:41.124
- So not funny.
- Somebody falls for it every year.

07:41.124 --> 07:45.649
- I don't see why you get off on this shi.....
- Marnie?

07:49.402 --> 07:54.688
Marnie? Marnie?!?

08:02.175 --> 08:05.479
Good one, Marnie. Lights out, phone on the floor.

08:05.479 --> 08:09.545
You know, you really should direct horror films.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.808
Wherever you are...

08:14.863 --> 08:20.159
Lemme guess. You want me to walk by an
open door frame so you can pop out, huh?

08:24.924 --> 08:32.639
Ok. Timing, timing is perfect. But you don't have the
app on your phone, so you can't talk like Ghostface.

08:33.169 --> 08:35.673
<i>- Can you?</i>
<i>- Yes, I can.</i>

08:36.580 --> 08:39.115
<i>- Who is this?</i>
<i>- Not an app.</i>

08:39.948 --> 08:43.076
<i>- Is this Trevor?</i>
<i>- Do I sound like a Trevor to you?</i>

08:43.076 --> 08:47.987
Think of me as your director. You re in my
movie. You got a fun part so don't blow it.

08:47.987 --> 08:48.920
- What movie?

08:48.960 --> 08:52.720
- Same one Marnie's in, only
her part got cut way back.

08:52.720 --> 08:58.526
But you, you re dumb blond with the big tits.
We'll have some fun with you before you die.

08:58.526 --> 09:03.949
I have a 4.0 GPA (Grade Point Average) and 135
IQ asshole. What did you do with Marnie?

09:03.949 --> 09:06.670
<i>- She's on the cutting room floor.</i>
<i>- That's not funny.</i>

09:06.670 --> 09:10.319
This isn't a comedy, it's a horror film. People live, people die.

09:10.319 --> 09:12.405
And you'd better start running.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.013
Marnie?

11:37.233 --> 11:40.643
- What do you think?
- Well, I guess today's the anniversary.

11:41.237 --> 11:44.010
- Kids...
- No, I meant the display.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.103
- It's good.
- Told the owner I'd kill his cat if you didn't get a ring.

11:55.604 --> 11:56.751
Nice...

12:38.288 --> 12:44.023
- Woah, 25 to stay alive!
- Shit! Sorry Sheriff!

12:46.422 --> 12:47.224
Kirby...

13:03.884 --> 13:06.711
Ehi, before you get in the car, you
have to promise not to kill me.

13:06.711 --> 13:08.932
Why? What did you do?

13:08.932 --> 13:10.673
Trevor called me last night.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.309
Why is he calling you?

13:12.309 --> 13:15.958
Because you won't take his calls, he knows
I have your ear and he wants to know.

13:16.584 --> 13:19.159
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

13:19.159 --> 13:22.881
- Can we just not talk about this?
- Fine, fine.

13:23.611 --> 13:25.560
So, Trevor called me last night.

13:26.259 --> 13:27.584
He called you too?

13:27.584 --> 13:31.723
He's afraid your cousin coming to Woodsboro is distracting
you from knowing how sorry he really is.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.924
- Well, that's inventive.
- God...

13:39.333 --> 13:42.919
Oh, by the way, have you seen the
Grim Reaper? Angel of Death?

13:42.919 --> 13:44.317
What are you talking about?

13:44.661 --> 13:50.125
Your cousin. Last stop in a book tour,
first stop in a road to a new life.

13:50.125 --> 13:54.128
It's very dramatic. She's the reason why I love horror movies.

13:54.128 --> 13:58.789
I'm sure she'd love to hear that. If
I knew her which, I don't really.

13:58.789 --> 14:03.657
Well, wherever she went, peple died.
Other people. It was never her.

14:03.657 --> 14:07.306
I mean, Stab is the wrong franchise for
her, it should be Final Destination.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.914
- And why is Jenny Randall calling me?

14:09.914 --> 14:11.728
- I cannot stand Jenny Randall...
- Hello?

14:11.728 --> 14:13.959
<i>- Oh, Jill...</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

14:13.959 --> 14:16.044
- Shh... Jenny, is this you?

14:17.045 --> 14:19.349
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

14:19.766 --> 14:22.237
- Ok, who is this?
- What does she want?

14:23.832 --> 14:27.554
<i>- I said, who is this?</i>
<i>- I asked you a question.</i>

14:27.554 --> 14:30.338
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

14:31.349 --> 14:32.288
I'm hanging up.

14:34.238 --> 14:36.605
Wow, that was original.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.180
I got a call like that this morning from Marnie the Carnie.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.547
- What?
- Watch out!

14:44.736 --> 14:46.655
<i>- Nice proof asshole!</i>
<i>- Ok...</i>

14:47.385 --> 14:51.139
- You should really stop at sign.
- Sorry...

14:53.985 --> 14:55.423
Angel of Death.

15:01.596 --> 15:05.296
- Mayor wants these down before lunch.
- Only 25 more to go.

15:09.091 --> 15:12.742
- Morning Sheriff.
- Morning Deputy. Joe.

15:12.919 --> 15:14.003
Morning Sheriff.

15:14.420 --> 15:18.559
- Looks like the celebration's begun.
- High School kids probably.

15:18.559 --> 15:23.178
Yeah. One generation's tragedy is the next one's joke.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.065
Sorry you can never get away from this.

15:26.556 --> 15:30.944
You know, I wish I had been old enough to be part
of the Forest when you were solving those crimes.

15:32.123 --> 15:35.919
It's those intense investigations that really bond relationships.

15:37.973 --> 15:40.683
- Yeah.
- How's Gale by the way?

15:41.694 --> 15:45.061
Gale's good. She's writing... fiction.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.410
Hey I made some lemon squares, they're in my car.

15:51.223 --> 15:53.174
Thanks Deputy, but no, thanks.

15:53.174 --> 15:57.208
Sheriff, you're not cheating on your
wife if you eat my lemon square.

15:58.115 --> 16:00.337
Yeah, but I would be cheating on the diet.

16:01.734 --> 16:03.819
<i>Sheriff Riley! Come in! Sheriff Riley!</i>

16:03.819 --> 16:05.622
This is Sheriff Riley, go ahead.

16:05.622 --> 16:09.834
You gotta get over to the Randall house
right away. It's bad Sheriff, real bad.

16:22.147 --> 16:26.746
<i>The book is "Out of Darkness" and its author</i>
Sidney Prescott is here with us today.

16:26.746 --> 16:33.387
<i>Have the 7 Stab movies all based on Gale Weathers'</i>
<i>books about you made it even harder to go on?</i>

16:33.387 --> 16:40.519
<i>I don't blame Gale, that's in the past. Now if I was a victim</i>
<i>for too long, it was up to me to reinvent myself.</i>

16:40.519 --> 16:42.440
- That's why I wrote this book.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.368
- Sidney Prescott, everybody. And rave reviews
for her book, "Out of Darkness".

16:48.306 --> 16:51.966
Allright Gale, let's do it. Let's reinvent myself.

16:54.021 --> 17:03.613
Except, I have no fucking idea what to write!

17:14.121 --> 17:14.920
- How's that new?

17:14.960 --> 17:17.636
- That's the 2.0 upgrade version.
I am totally mobile, man.

17:18.095 --> 17:18.887
Nice.

17:20.284 --> 17:24.920
Ouh, this is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer,
here with the luscious Olivia "Don't look

17:24.960 --> 17:26.852
at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

17:26.852 --> 17:31.512
Here is my Woodsboro masquerade anniversary
question: What is your favorite scary movie?

17:32.179 --> 17:34.129
Is that all you got? Some stupid douche question?

17:34.129 --> 17:35.725
Yeah, where did you hear that anyway?

17:36.183 --> 17:38.895
It's a line from Stab 1. Hey Charlie.

17:38.895 --> 17:42.640
- You re a genre nut Kirby, what's
your favorite scary movie?

17:42.680 --> 17:43.273
- Bambi.

17:44.253 --> 17:45.671
- Dork.
- What?

17:45.671 --> 17:47.443
That's... funny, Kirby.

17:49.883 --> 17:53.084
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.953
Yeah, I wish, right? Asshole.

17:59.173 --> 18:01.280
- I think Charlie likes you.

18:01.320 --> 18:05.648
- And I like him. To tease, to torment,
to make him squirm.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.014
You could do a lot worse, trust me.

18:10.443 --> 18:13.852
Oh, hi Trevor. Bye Trevor.

18:14.478 --> 18:20.286
Can we talk? Somebody cares about you over here you know?

18:20.286 --> 18:22.371
Someone who made you really happy once.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.165
Someone who never should have let you go.

18:25.165 --> 18:29.232
When you re done with a phone call, you let someone go...

18:29.232 --> 18:32.328
When you take someone to the airport, you let them go...

18:32.328 --> 18:37.333
When you tell someone you love her, and she gives you
everything, and then you go out with someone else...

18:37.333 --> 18:41.795
that is not letting her go, that is dumping
her. Ok? That's betrayal.

18:43.599 --> 18:49.239
Trevor Sheldon denied live on Hall Pass with Robbie
Mercer. What is your favorite scary movie, man?

18:49.551 --> 18:50.521
I'll show you.

18:57.758 --> 19:05.170
Now I began to believe myself that that was all I was,
a victim. And that was unacceptable to me...

19:06.036 --> 19:13.479
So, I sat down and began to write
a new role that would be my own.

19:13.479 --> 19:18.287
A role for a woman who could leave the walls
of fear behind and step out into the sunlight.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.028
Out of Darkness.

19:21.863 --> 19:22.800
- Thank you.

19:22.840 --> 19:28.889
- Ok, we re gonna start the book signing in
a sec, so buy your copies while they last.

19:28.889 --> 19:33.654
<i>- May you ladies.</i>
<i>- New York Times best seller. Rave reviews...</i>

19:34.499 --> 19:38.324
- Gale... I am glad you came.
- Congratulations, Sidney.

19:38.774 --> 19:41.901
- I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but...
- Well, you can get one.

19:45.874 --> 19:51.086
- Dewey! Ehi!
- Hey, Sidney. Gale, you made it.

19:51.368 --> 19:52.515
What's going on Dewey?

19:52.515 --> 19:56.341
Hey, Sid, I am sorry. I gotta do
something... I am really sorry.

19:56.341 --> 20:02.045
Excuse me. This will only take a minute. I need
you all to stay where you are and remain silent.

20:02.045 --> 20:04.338
Nobody leaves, you heard the Sheriff, thanks you.

20:04.338 --> 20:08.551
- Can't this wait 45, I am running an event here.
- M'am this is a police event now.

20:08.551 --> 20:09.440
- What's going on?

20:09.480 --> 20:12.762
- Gale, this is police business. If
you could just let us handle this.

20:12.762 --> 20:14.774
I am talking to my husband, Deputy Judy.

20:14.774 --> 20:19.132
Listen. There's a phone we believe may have
been taken from the scene of a crime.

20:19.132 --> 20:22.605
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.296
- The rest is "need to know".
- And I am not "need to know"?

20:26.296 --> 20:27.161
Shhhh.

20:30.924 --> 20:32.760
Sheriff! Ringing out here!

20:37.076 --> 20:37.670
There.

20:44.051 --> 20:46.127
- It's coming from the trunk
- Yeah.

20:46.398 --> 20:48.733
- Dewey...
- They need everyone to stay back.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.787
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

21:00.212 --> 21:04.007
- Damn. - It's now official crime scene. Let's lock it down.

21:04.007 --> 21:05.480
- Crime scene. - Detach him right
out of here. Everybody back.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.332
- Give me that camera. - Stand back.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.916
- Give me that camera.
- Stand back.

21:07.916 --> 21:13.046
- Please tell me this is a prank, Dewey.
- I am afraid not, Sid. Come on.

21:15.069 --> 21:16.560
<i>- Amber, you re not gonna believe this...</i>

21:16.560 --> 21:19.729
- Stand back, Gale. Gale.
- Just wanna see.

21:22.879 --> 21:27.831
Ok, essays are due Tuesday, "Why Woodsboro is the best..."

21:28.779 --> 21:32.042
Anything with an on-off swith should be off, that's the rule.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.066
Somebody wanna share?

21:35.066 --> 21:38.267
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper were
murdered last night. - What?

21:38.861 --> 21:41.092
- What? - Stabbed to death.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.626
- What's your favorite scary movie? - Shut up!

21:43.626 --> 21:47.943
Y'all Tuesday, class is not hold then
- That was fast.

21:47.943 --> 21:51.800
This week marks the anniversary of
the infamous Woodsboro murders.

21:51.800 --> 21:58.796
Two girls killed the exact day local celebrity victim
Sidney Prescott chose to return to her hometown.

21:58.796 --> 22:02.967
<i>It could be something right out of a Gale Weathers'</i>
best seller. And where is she now?

22:02.967 --> 22:07.356
<i>Well, living right here in Woodsboro, cos she's the</i>
<i>wife of Sheriff Dewey Riley - Mrs. Riley - Hoss.</i>

22:07.637 --> 22:09.159
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

22:10.588 --> 22:12.674
Excuse me, Gale. He's conducting an interview.

22:12.674 --> 22:16.677
- Great! I love interviews.
- You have to wait, Gale. Sorry, can't let you in there.

22:17.928 --> 22:20.430
What are you gonna do? Arrest me, Deputy Judy?

22:20.430 --> 22:25.446
If it comes to it. Civilian interference with a police investigation
poses many a problem in a court of law.

22:25.446 --> 22:29.657
Ok. Listen to me Judy. I don't mind that
you re working with my hudband.

22:29.657 --> 22:32.920
Or that you re even baking those little treats, as you do

22:33.483 --> 22:37.623
But if you re gonna start acting like him, you gotta put
a mustache on, cos you sound ridiculous - Gale.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.395
- Judy.
- Gale!

22:40.782 --> 22:44.504
Deputy. Gale. Calm please.

22:45.140 --> 22:49.207
- Uh, Sidney, if you don't mind giving us a minute.
- Sid. - Hi, Gale.

22:50.010 --> 22:55.013
Dewey, would you please explain to Betty Crocker
that I have every right to be here?

22:55.430 --> 22:57.797
If there's been another murder in Woodsboro obviusly....

22:59.611 --> 23:03.500
- That is not public information.
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey.

23:03.782 --> 23:07.369
- It is?
- Yes, the whole world knows about it before me.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.840
She wants to be a part of the investigation, Sheriff.

23:10.632 --> 23:17.941
Ok. Hang on. Uhm, are you familiar with
the phrase "I wrote a book on this"?

23:21.068 --> 23:25.360
- Gale, with all due respect, I don't
see how that pertains to...

23:25.400 --> 23:27.752
- Because I wrote the book on this.

23:28.513 --> 23:33.809
"The Woodsboro murders" by Gale Weathers.
- But you re not a reporter anymore, Gale.

23:33.809 --> 23:34.956
- Woh, woh, woh..
- And even if you were...

23:34.956 --> 23:37.667
Woh. Don't treat me like I'm the media.

23:37.667 --> 23:43.964
I helped solve these things. 3 times,
remember? You and me, together.

23:44.693 --> 23:48.447
<i>- But I am the Sheriff now, Gale.</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:54.119
- What, you re not gonna help you with this?
- I can't.

23:56.277 --> 24:02.575
Allright then, I am going rogue. This is what I am
good at, Dewey. This is what I know how to do.

24:08.633 --> 24:10.749
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

24:13.084 --> 24:17.151
- They don't. They really don't.
- Thank you, Sir.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.475
- Sheriff. - Yeah? - We got a couple high school kids in here.

24:19.236 --> 24:21.050
We got a couple high school kids in here.

24:21.050 --> 24:25.532
Two of em, they say they got threatening phone
calls this morning from the victims' phones.

24:25.532 --> 24:32.529
- Names are Olivia Morris and Jill Roberts.
- That's Sid's cousin. Damn.

24:33.603 --> 24:35.938
- Right in here, Sheriff. - Hey, Jill.

24:35.938 --> 24:38.722
- Sidney. Hi.
- Hi.

24:39.692 --> 24:42.194
It's nice to see you, even under the circumstances.

24:42.924 --> 24:44.560
- You ok? - Yeah.

24:44.873 --> 24:49.743
- So two of you got phone calls?
- Yeah, us two. "What's your favorite scary movie?".

24:50.441 --> 24:55.561
It was the killer's voice. From Stab. From,
I mean you know, from your life.

24:56.249 --> 24:58.448
I am Kirby, by the way. I am their friend.

24:59.762 --> 25:02.305
- And the killer didn't call you?
- No.

25:02.827 --> 25:07.623
This is..this is a bad thing? Does that mean that
I am not gonna live as long as these two?

25:07.623 --> 25:14.025
No... Maybe. Of course not. Just... just be careful.

25:14.025 --> 25:19.071
- Oh my God, did you hear that? I am gonna be next!
- Dewey, I shouldn't be here. I should leave town.

25:19.071 --> 25:21.438
I am afraid that's not really possible, Sidney.

25:21.855 --> 25:26.515
Look, nobody thinks you re involved but
everyone's a suspect. I am sorry.

25:26.515 --> 25:31.281
And there was evidence in your car connecting the
killer to you. You may be a material witness.

25:33.689 --> 25:39.256
- So, you know, you Il have 24 hour police surveillance.
- That's comforting.

25:42.071 --> 25:50.840
It's Rebecca. Oh my fucking God, Henry. Yes!
Its true. Two girls butchered. Pay day.

25:50.840 --> 25:58.492
I was so not feeling Woodsboro. Was like lame PR,
am I right? Well, fuck me wow! Best idea ever.

25:59.149 --> 26:00.577
Henry, I Il call you back.

26:02.589 --> 26:06.240
Excuse me. I have to geek out. I hadn't
got a chance to say something earlier,

26:06.280 --> 26:07.949
but it's suck an honor to meet you.

26:07.949 --> 26:09.690
- Thank you. - Rebecca Walters.

26:09.690 --> 26:10.000
- Hi.

26:10.040 --> 26:13.308
- When I was a kid it was all about
top story with Gale Weathers.

26:13.308 --> 26:16.748
- You were my 90s!
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

26:16.748 --> 26:20.127
You gave it all for love, I know that. How
long have you and Dewey been married?

26:20.127 --> 26:24.130
- Ten years.
- Oh, just like your characters in Stab 3. Wow!

26:24.130 --> 26:25.516
Wow...

26:26.872 --> 26:30.385
I didn't mean "bad wow", it's just, it always seemed
like more of a horror movie romance than a real one

26:30.385 --> 26:32.857
because it was a movie, and in real life it should never be.

26:33.691 --> 26:38.289
Uh, dug a hole. Climbing out, here. So anyway,

26:38.289 --> 26:43.335
Kudos on being brave enough to drop off the professional
map. Any plans on revitalizing your tarnished brand

26:44.544 --> 26:49.486
Listen, in about 2 seconds I am gonna revitalize
your face... with my tarnished brand.

26:50.674 --> 26:51.645
I still got it.

26:53.698 --> 26:54.876
Uhm, tasty.

27:03.853 --> 27:08.587
She's so pretty. When you think about what she
survived. She must have scars everywhere.

27:08.587 --> 27:10.359
Shhhh, Come on.

27:10.922 --> 27:17.074
Her mom is my sister. I have scars too.
None ever asks me about my scars.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.808
- I am sorry Mrs. Roberts.
- She means nice scars, mom.

27:22.152 --> 27:25.185
Oh, well. Fine.

27:28.625 --> 27:36.383
- How are you? How's Gale?
- I am alright. But Gale,

27:36.383 --> 27:45.046
it's been hard on her. Small town. Small
town husband. Not much to write about.

27:47.101 --> 27:48.360
- You two ok?

27:48.400 --> 27:55.348
- Well, i read somewhere once "Just when
you think things can't get any worse,

27:56.109 --> 28:03.939
sometimes they don't... Sometimes, they get better.",
Out of Darkness by Sidney Prescott, page 220.

28:13.781 --> 28:14.616
Gotta get going.

28:20.881 --> 28:26.762
- It's nice to see you, Dewey. Been thru a lot together.
- We Il get thru this too, ok?

28:27.867 --> 28:28.701
I Il go.

28:49.470 --> 28:52.775
Be good. It's ok. Relax, relax. It's just me.

28:52.775 --> 28:56.080
- What the hell are you doing here?
There are cops right out front.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.654
- No match for the ninja, baby.

29:00.324 --> 29:04.400
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
of Sidney Prescott? I mean, that's like being

29:04.440 --> 29:06.037
on Top Chef with Jeffrey Dahmer.

29:06.412 --> 29:12.022
Can you please get away from the window?
You've no right to be in here. Not anymore.

29:12.334 --> 29:17.861
Hang on. I heard you got a phone
call from the killer. Is that true?

29:18.694 --> 29:23.083
- And you care?
- Don't you think it'd be a lot safer with me around?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.160
- I don't trust you, Trevor.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.756
- Hey. I am just gonna have to make
sure that you do. Alright?

29:33.165 --> 29:37.452
Oh, sorry, I didn't...
- No, he's just leaving. Its... it's my ex.

29:37.452 --> 29:41.100
- Oh. - Yeah, the one and only.

29:41.726 --> 29:43.227
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:44.228 --> 29:49.796
It's cool to meet you... officially. I keep meaning
to pick up a copy of your book, but...

29:51.985 --> 29:53.246
You re smaller in person.

30:01.974 --> 30:07.572
- What?
- Nothing, you just, ehm, you remind me of me.

30:10.147 --> 30:13.378
- Lock your window, ok?
- Yeah, goodnight.

30:14.151 --> 30:14.776
Night.

30:17.528 --> 30:22.800
- Sorry about that. Just making
my rounds before taking off.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.347
- Great, thanks.

30:27.715 --> 30:30.739
- You don't remember me, do you?
- Sorry?

30:31.479 --> 30:34.533
We went to High School together. Judy Hicks?

30:35.096 --> 30:43.094
We had the same Homeroom in. Drama club too. We
were in Peter Pan together. I played a Lost Boy.

30:44.345 --> 30:51.966
- You were... Tiger Lily.
- I am sorry, it was a long time ago.

30:53.395 --> 30:59.692
It's ok, ehm. You had a lot of stuff going on back then.

31:00.630 --> 31:04.561
Well, it's nice to see you again, Judy.
- You too.

31:11.859 --> 31:15.101
<i>- Everything ok upstairs?</i>
<i>- You re supposed to be out front, Perkins.</i>

31:24.423 --> 31:30.480
- 4 letter word for... courage?
- Uh, guts.

31:36.141 --> 31:40.880
- It's Olivia Morris, she lives
next door. She's on the list.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.347
- She can live next door to me.

31:43.837 --> 31:49.320
Now seriously, ehm, Mary I am warning
you, ok? I am gonna have to get physical.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.978
I mean it. This is it! Just fuck off!

32:03.145 --> 32:05.440
- Hello?
- What are you guys up to?

32:05.648 --> 32:07.440
Uhm, we re watching Shaun of the Dead.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.589
- You know there's two zombies sitting
outside your house in a car?

32:10.589 --> 32:14.759
- Yeah, they are cops. You wanna come up?
- Angel of Death leave?

32:14.759 --> 32:19.566
- No, she's in the guest room.
- Forget it. Next door is close enough.

32:19.566 --> 32:25.374
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's. It's creepier in here tonight.

32:25.791 --> 32:31.077
No, the zombies are still in their
car, so you should be alright.

32:31.077 --> 32:33.162
- Call me tomorrow, ok?
- Right.

32:33.996 --> 32:36.988
- She wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

32:37.342 --> 32:38.416
Watch this.

32:48.019 --> 32:53.127
- Who's speaking?
- What's your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

32:53.513 --> 32:56.840
It's the worst imitation I've ever heard,
Jill. Speaking of Stab, you heard where

32:56.880 --> 32:58.216
the Stab- a- thon's gonna be at?

32:58.768 --> 33:01.833
No. It doesn't matter to me anyways, mom doesn't let me go.

33:05.034 --> 33:08.924
- It's Trevor, I'll handle this.
- Trevor is calling... again.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.719
<i>- What do you want?</i>
<i>- I wanna talk to Jill.</i>

33:12.719 --> 33:18.181
Uhm, no it's Kirby. Sorry, Trevor, Jill is screening
her calls from all past relationships.

33:18.181 --> 33:21.591
- What's going on over there?
- Hang on one sec. What is he saying?

33:21.831 --> 33:27.086
<i>- I am not Trevor.</i>
<i>- W-What? I can barely hear you, Trevor.</i>

33:27.607 --> 33:32.831
<i>- This isn't Trevor.</i>
<i>- Oh, oh, alright. Then why do you have his phone?</i>

33:32.831 --> 33:38.148
- Whoever this is. He's trying to do Ghostface.
- He's being weird.

33:38.877 --> 33:43.058
- I wanna talk to Jill.
- Ok, well, she doesn't want to talk to you.

33:43.506 --> 33:48.241
Come on, Mr. Ghostface, whisper to me. Aren't
you supposed to ask me a question?

33:48.793 --> 33:52.901
<i>- Alright. How's the movie?</i>
<i>- What movie?</i>

33:52.901 --> 33:57.801
<i>- Shaun of the Dead.</i>
<i>- How did you know that?</i>

33:58.364 --> 34:03.128
<i>- Because I'm standing in the closet.</i>
<i>- Stop, you're not.</i>

34:03.514 --> 34:05.767
- What's going on?
- Trevor is being weird.

34:05.767 --> 34:07.820
- I mean, if it is him, I dunno.
- What?

34:08.132 --> 34:11.793
<i>- This is not fucking Trevor!</i>
<i>- Well, then who the fuck are you?</i>

34:12.137 --> 34:19.268
<i>- Open the closet door.</i>
<i>- You do know there are cops all over this house?</i>

34:19.268 --> 34:22.261
<i>I think that I have just enough time to slice someone open.</i>

34:23.543 --> 34:26.088
- I'll talk to him.
- Shhhhhh.

34:27.578 --> 34:28.975
- What's going on over there, you guys? -

34:29.913 --> 34:30.257
- S-Sorry, I dunno. Kirby? -Shhhhhh.

34:30.257 --> 34:33.396
S-Sorry, I-I dunno. Kirby?
- Shhhh.

34:33.396 --> 34:35.929
<i>- Kirby.</i>
<i>- Come on, do it.</i>

34:36.451 --> 34:40.318
<i>- There is no way you re in there.</i>
<i>- See for yourself.</i>

34:41.288 --> 34:46.824
Kirby? Kirby, come on, talk to
me. This isn't funny! Kirby!

34:54.540 --> 34:59.169
<i>- Liar. I am over this.</i>
<i>- I never said I was in your closet.</i>

35:04.872 --> 35:05.956
Oh my God!

35:06.687 --> 35:08.146
- Olivia! - Oh my God!

35:09.188 --> 35:10.618
Help, in my house!

35:15.872 --> 35:16.633
No!

35:25.432 --> 35:27.143
No. No!

35:38.695 --> 35:40.571
<i>- Hoss!</i>
<i>- Olivia!</i>

35:40.852 --> 35:41.540
Perkins!

35:43.490 --> 35:44.428
Shit.

36:40.751 --> 36:44.650
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Welcome home Sidney. Preview of coming events.</i>

36:45.379 --> 36:47.680
- Why don't you come for me?
You got the balls for that?

36:47.720 --> 36:49.801
- Oh, poor Sidney. You think this is all about you?

36:49.801 --> 36:53.481
<i>- You think you're still the star.</i>
<i>- This isn't a fucking movie!</i>

36:53.481 --> 36:55.222
<i>- It will be. - These are innocent people.</i>

36:55.222 --> 36:59.320
Spare me the lecture! You've done very
well by all this blood shed, haven't you?

36:59.360 --> 37:01.175
How about the town you left behind?

37:01.696 --> 37:08.025
<i>I ve got plans for you. I am gonna slit your eyelids in</i>
<i>half so you don't blink when I stab you in the face.</i>

37:08.306 --> 37:15.574
<i>You'll die when I want you to, Sidney. Not a moment</i>
<i>before. Until then, you re going to suffer.</i>

37:16.554 --> 37:20.443
- Sidney!
- Jill? Stay right there.

37:21.423 --> 37:23.226
- Is she...
- Do not look, ok?

37:24.029 --> 37:27.887
- She said you were the Angel of Death.
- Look out!

37:49.562 --> 37:52.483
- Come look. Look over there.
- He's in here.

37:53.181 --> 37:58.571
- Where is he?
- He was...

37:58.571 --> 38:02.188
<i>- What's your status?</i>
<i>- Jill?</i>

38:03.826 --> 38:04.629
- Don't.

38:13.918 --> 38:16.661
What happened? Oh my God, Jill.

38:19.173 --> 38:24.532
Jesus. Your hon, 'Vis. Baby, baby. Come here. Come
on, let's go, let's go. Let's get care of you, right?

38:25.887 --> 38:29.641
- Jill? Oh my God. Are you ok?
- Give me a hand.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.007
- Keep your pressure on it.
- There's somebody back there.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.344
- Call it in.
- Right.

38:36.116 --> 38:41.892
- Hey, are you ok?
- You should look upstairs.

38:53.684 --> 38:55.842
<i>Let's get the corners and rub around these.</i>

39:01.263 --> 39:02.587
<i>Thought this was over!</i>

39:05.924 --> 39:07.634
<i>It's all your fault, Sidney.</i>

39:08.468 --> 39:09.927
<i>Just like her mother!</i>

39:15.839 --> 39:17.444
I am sorry of what I said.

39:19.562 --> 39:23.075
- Shouldn't you get that looked at?
- Yeah.

39:25.472 --> 39:26.960
- What the hell happened?

39:27.000 --> 39:30.800
- Ok, I saw him going to that yard,
two houses down, right before.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.209
- A-A-And I circled around to cut him off.
- And?

39:35.013 --> 39:37.080
- And I met Hoss coming from the other direction.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.913
- No, he must have circled back around
somehow. He's like a ghost.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.604
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

39:44.886 --> 39:46.971
Alright. Get outta here.

40:00.473 --> 40:04.539
This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

40:04.539 --> 40:08.157
What began as a day of remembrance,
has ended with a serial murder.

40:08.157 --> 40:13.870
Olivia Morris, who officially would never go out with me,
is dead. So is Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper.

40:14.214 --> 40:18.010
Our local legacy, the Stab movies, is coming to life.

40:18.010 --> 40:23.953
- Excuse me, are you recording with that thing?
- My video blog upload. He's webcasting right now.

40:23.953 --> 40:28.373
- Mind turning it off? A little old school, off the record?
- Can't. Owe it to my audience.

40:28.373 --> 40:31.125
- Turn the fucking thing off.
- Ok...

40:33.075 --> 40:37.351
- So, you two are the boys who run the
movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

40:37.351 --> 40:40.280
- Oh, Charlie rents it. I'm just
VP, in case he takes a bullet.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.521
- It's called Cinema Club.

40:42.146 --> 40:47.400
- So you must have a very unique insight
into the movie buffs at your school?

40:47.440 --> 40:48.100
- Maybe.

40:49.007 --> 40:52.478
What if we could catch the killer, by working together?

40:52.478 --> 40:57.911
Two generations of cutting edge journalists
intertwining our passions for media.

40:59.131 --> 41:01.800
- What would you say?
- I love you?

41:02.571 --> 41:07.600
Very good. Now, you give me your expertise
on the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High

41:07.640 --> 41:10.088
and maybe I give you something in return

41:10.568 --> 41:18.440
- Say, a celebrity visit to your Cinema Club... by me?
- What about Sidney?

41:19.753 --> 41:20.520
- What about Sidney?

41:20.560 --> 41:22.642
- Hey, you know her, right? I
am you're friends with her?

41:23.861 --> 41:29.877
No offense but, that'd be a big deal for some of the club.
A visit from Sidney Prescott, I mean, she's the star.

41:29.877 --> 41:34.058
Uh, yes she's Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

41:34.058 --> 41:38.051
- When was the bookshelf in the box office? - Never.

41:41.919 --> 41:46.131
- There's no broken bones. I think you'll be
fine. Maybe just take a couple weeks off.

41:49.572 --> 41:56.494
So, Sidney... Uh, ouh. Anyway, long story short, Random
wants to lock you into 3 more books, now.

41:56.807 --> 42:00.457
See the blank line in your contract? You can name your phrase.

42:00.457 --> 42:03.939
And as soon as you re clear in this investigation,
we re on the next plane to New York.

42:03.939 --> 42:09.225
- I booked Today, The View, Nancy Grace, MTV News.
- Excuse me, can I... can I ask you a question?

42:10.163 --> 42:15.001
- Did you read my book?
- Thought I'd wait for the movie.

42:15.001 --> 42:26.616
- Book tour is over. - Sidney. Accept your situation.
You re a victim, for life. So, embrace it, use it.

42:27.492 --> 42:30.520
I know you care about your readers. All
those little down-trodden fucks that

42:30.560 --> 42:32.016
just need a light at the end of their

42:32.016 --> 42:36.360
tunnels so they don't jump off a bridge. And
a lucky break like this? I am talking a 100

42:36.400 --> 42:38.199
percent increase in sales, minimum.

42:38.199 --> 42:43.454
That's maybe a million more people getting your message
and you get a ton more checks. Win-win.

42:45.758 --> 42:48.365
- I won't be needing you anymore.
- Sidney!

42:48.365 --> 42:50.481
- You re fired.
- Fired?

42:50.481 --> 42:53.577
- Fired!
- Fine.

43:16.119 --> 43:18.110
"What do you think about my book, Rebecca?"

43:31.602 --> 43:36.157
The problem of Sidney is she never gets laid.
Or even a little shit faced once in a while.

43:37.585 --> 43:41.037
She'll call me at 9 to apologize. Just watch.

43:48.231 --> 43:55.019
She'll come around. Gotta just give her
time. Sidney will come.... around.

44:07.092 --> 44:09.938
<i>- This is Rebecca.</i>
<i>- Sidney Prescott, please.</i>

44:10.397 --> 44:13.764
I am handling Ms. Prescott's calls and
appearances. May I take a message?

44:13.764 --> 44:23.096
<i>You are the message. Are you writing this down?</i>
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>

44:23.096 --> 44:27.966
But, it's kinda hard to hear you. I'm in a hospital,
with Sidney. If you can just hang on one second.

44:28.550 --> 44:31.958
<i>I've got time. It's you that doesn't.</i>

44:39.716 --> 44:43.302
<i>You know, Rebecca, it doesn't sound</i>
<i>to me like you re in the hospital.</i>

44:43.793 --> 44:50.537
<i>Sounds like you re in a parking garage.</i>
<i>A dark and deserted parking garage.</i>

44:52.102 --> 44:57.221
<i>But if you wanna be in the hospital, I'd be</i>
<i>happy to put you there. In the morgue!</i>

45:44.180 --> 45:47.736
Help! Help! Save me!

46:03.384 --> 46:06.243
Cut and run, you fucking bastard.

47:14.950 --> 47:21.487
This is an ongoing investigation. But rest assured,
we re pursuing a number of leads.

47:21.487 --> 47:23.822
- Sheriff
- The less I say about that, the better.

47:24.406 --> 47:26.668
So, I'm taking questions.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.588
- Dewey!
- Gale?

47:29.870 --> 47:35.333
Any comment on the fact that these killings seem to resemble
the pattern of the original Woodsboro murders?

47:35.615 --> 47:37.491
Hun? Later!

47:38.461 --> 47:39.545
<i>What was that, Sheriff?</i>

47:39.784 --> 47:43.746
As I was saying... my officers are hard at work.

47:43.746 --> 47:50.399
We just want the community to know that we re very
close to bringing this whole situation under control.

47:57.666 --> 48:00.731
Hey, someone! Get up to the
top of the structure! Go! Go!

48:00.731 --> 48:03.650
<i>- Everyone back! Stay back!</i>
<i>- Back, nobody move!</i>

48:03.650 --> 48:05.776
Jenkins, I want a man on this stairwell.

48:08.237 --> 48:10.782
<i>- You see anybody?</i>
<i>- Nobody out there.</i>

48:11.168 --> 48:12.836
There's nobody out there, Sheriff!

48:14.639 --> 48:19.060
- It's all under control huh, Sheriff?
- But what am I supposed to say?

48:19.060 --> 48:23.554
Listen, I may not be wearing a uniform, but
I happen to have a lead and you don't.

48:25.222 --> 48:27.588
So let me know when you re back on Team Gale.

48:29.673 --> 48:31.133
Move back, I am the Sheriff.

48:41.643 --> 48:47.210
Ok, Cinema Club, we re not in session. Welcome.
I'll tell you a little bit about ourselves.

48:47.210 --> 48:54.196
We re a sanctioned after school activity, one rung
below the Glee club, two above Nintendo Wii Fit

48:54.196 --> 48:59.795
and let me just say to our guest
, Sidney Prescott, it's an honor.

49:03.308 --> 49:07.416
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis, forget Linda
Blair, I mean, this is the ultimate.

49:07.905 --> 49:14.725
Thanks, I-I guess. This, uhm... you film your entire High
School experience and what, post it on the net?

49:14.725 --> 49:18.760
- Everybody will be doing it someday, Sid.
- It's kind of the one component the killer is missing.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.360
- Wait, what do you mean?

49:20.400 --> 49:25.756
- Well, if you wanna be the new "new version",
the killer should be filming the murders.

49:25.756 --> 49:30.103
That's like the natural next step in the psycho slasher
innovation. I mean you film em all real time

49:30.103 --> 49:32.960
- and then before you get caught,
you upload em into cyberspace.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.659
- Making your art as immortal as you.

49:35.702 --> 49:37.194
- Not to implicate him...
- Not to implicate me...

49:37.506 --> 49:43.250
- So who do you think is behind the murders?
- Well, it's a Stab fanatic, clearly.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.880
Working on less of a Screquel
and more of a Screamake.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.285
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.

49:47.285 --> 49:50.934
Cos all there are now are remakes.
Only horror the studios green-light.

49:51.247 --> 49:55.908
I mean, there are still rules, but the rules have
changed. The unexpected is the new clichÃ©.

49:55.908 --> 49:58.764
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off

49:58.764 --> 50:02.873
done with some flashy music video direction.
And the kills gotta be way more extreme.

50:02.873 --> 50:07.845
Modern audiences got savvy to the rules of the originals,
so the reversals become the new standard.

50:07.845 --> 50:13.308
In fact, the only surefire way to survive a modern
horror movie, you pretty much have to be gay.

50:16.260 --> 50:20.080
So, why are you so sure that the killer is
working by the rules of a horror remake?

50:20.120 --> 50:22.661
- Well, the original Stab structure is pretty apparent.

50:22.661 --> 50:25.080
- Two kids killed in a house while
their parents are away.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.708
- And then the school's "hot chick"
savaged beyond recognition.

50:27.708 --> 50:30.209
- We all know where it goes from there...
- A party.

50:30.877 --> 50:34.800
- Exactly. A party. Guaranteed
third act main cast blood bath.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.727
- Fingers crossed on some nudity for a change.

50:40.094 --> 50:44.890
- Ok, do you know of a party that's happening tonight?
- Well, there's Stab- a- thon.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.200
- Stab- a- thon?

50:47.240 --> 50:51.990
- Uh, It's a movie marathon. All 7 Stabs
back to back. We do it every year.

50:51.990 --> 50:57.360
- Is tonight? There's a killer out there patterning
his murders after the original movie.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.090
- I know, it's pretty wild.

50:59.090 --> 51:00.414
We have to call it off.

51:00.758 --> 51:05.732
- Uhm, ok, I mean, it's Friday. I am sure we re not
the only party that's going on at Woodsboro.

51:05.732 --> 51:10.183
- But where is this circle-jerk gonna take place?
- So, let's ready for this Q&A.

51:10.183 --> 51:12.120
- No, no. I really want the location.

51:12.160 --> 51:16.138
- You know, it's kind of an underground
thing. Email invites. Pretty secret.

51:17.149 --> 51:23.331
What, you re not gonna tell me? Really?
We re working together. Remember?

51:24.696 --> 51:27.856
- So you re ready for the Q&A?
- Fuck you. Let's go.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.392
That was awesome.

51:34.017 --> 51:36.801
- Nobody comes to the house unless we say so.
- Got it.

51:36.801 --> 51:38.886
I feel like I'm under house arrest.

51:54.265 --> 51:59.640
You know when people say "I know how
you feel", but you know they re just saying

51:59.680 --> 52:01.918
that because they really have no

52:01.918 --> 52:08.246
freaking idea how you feel? I know how you feel.

52:12.177 --> 52:14.679
I am so sorry about Olivia.

52:19.622 --> 52:21.467
I am sorry about your publicist.

52:26.617 --> 52:31.520
How do you handle it, people
staring at you all the time?

52:31.560 --> 52:33.436
- People stare at me?

52:35.521 --> 52:40.703
I could never handle that kind of attention. I just
feel like it would take over your whole life.

52:43.518 --> 52:56.915
Uh, all I do is I... try not to think about me. I
have people I care about. I focus on them.

52:58.793 --> 53:01.962
And the rest, uhm, it works out.

53:04.255 --> 53:10.240
You saved my life last night. I mean, I know
we re family but... you heard a thing on me.

53:11.564 --> 53:16.610
Makes me wonder, you know, if I'd be
brave enough to do the same thing.

53:18.622 --> 53:21.198
I really hope you never have to find that out.

53:24.847 --> 53:27.631
Oh, if you need me, you know where to find me.

53:28.121 --> 53:31.217
I'll be up in my cell, oh, I mean, my room.

53:55.634 --> 54:01.412
Our rooms are boarded up. That's the
view from my cell. It's really weird.

54:01.975 --> 54:05.446
I think Olivia would understand, ok? She'd
want me to be around other people.

54:06.322 --> 54:10.701
Holy shit. Even if I did just crash land on planet dork.

54:12.234 --> 54:15.257
Speaking of which, Trevor's here.
- Hey, Kirby.

54:15.257 --> 54:20.021
- What is he doing there? That is so not his scene.
- I have no idea, maybe he thought you would be here.

54:20.302 --> 54:25.142
Yeah, fat chance. After what happened last night?
I mean, my mum is just completely freaked out.

54:25.142 --> 54:25.960
- It's not prim.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.801
- Alright, you go do your good girl thing
and I'll drink for the both of us.

54:29.801 --> 54:33.210
- I will keep you posted.
- Alright, be safe.

55:17.428 --> 55:22.609
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

55:22.609 --> 55:26.614
- Thank you! Thank you. Gracias. Gracias.
- Shhhh.

55:27.938 --> 55:31.034
Cinema Club thanks you for coming
up for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

55:31.034 --> 55:33.223
Thank you, number-3-thon. We thank you in rows.

55:33.223 --> 55:36.680
- Are you ready to drink every time someone
can't get a cellphone signal?

55:36.720 --> 55:37.081
- Yeah!

55:37.363 --> 55:41.520
- Are you ready to drink every time someone
shuts the refrigerator door and, oh my God, there's

55:41.560 --> 55:43.274
the harmless character right behind it?

55:43.274 --> 55:44.734
Yeah!

55:44.734 --> 55:48.360
- Are you ready to drink every time
somebody screams the word....

55:48.400 --> 55:48.738
- No!

55:48.738 --> 55:51.834
Let's get the Stab-athon started!

56:07.870 --> 56:09.298
<i>Ghostface!</i>

56:10.340 --> 56:11.664
<i>Get out in 5!</i>

56:12.739 --> 56:14.063
<i>Move your ass!</i>

56:14.657 --> 56:15.700
Screw you!

56:51.951 --> 56:52.952
Yes!

56:59.979 --> 57:02.106
Uh, Yeah. Back on my game.

57:04.014 --> 57:07.257
Perfect. New work in progress, chapter 1.

57:07.601 --> 57:14.316
When I moved to Woodsboro, I never in a million years
dreamed that I would again play the critical role...

57:14.316 --> 57:16.890
...in solving another series of these...

57:25.553 --> 57:26.702
What the hell?

57:50.254 --> 57:53.872
- Gale, where are you?
- I followed the kids to the Stab-a-thon.

57:54.154 --> 57:58.640
There's an old abandoned farm on 4th Dylan Road.
Listen, I-I got it under surveillance, but

57:58.680 --> 58:00.898
I think the killer is about to make his move.

58:01.451 --> 58:03.080
- What makes you so sure?

58:03.120 --> 58:07.373
- You do a remake to outdo the original,
that's what the kids said.

58:07.373 --> 58:11.753
This party is all about the Stab movies.
Come on, how meta can you get?

58:12.243 --> 58:15.860
- How "what the.." can you get?
- I dunno, I heard em say it.

58:16.278 --> 58:22.637
- Dewey, listen to me, you have to get out here. Come
on, you catch the killer, I get the story. It's a win-win.

58:22.637 --> 58:27.474
- Well, I thought you were going rogue, Gale.
- Oh come..are you serious? C'mon!

58:28.560 --> 58:33.800
- Forget it. Thanks for having faith
in me! I gotta fix my equipment.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.502
- Gale!

58:37.317 --> 58:38.328
Shit.

58:53.468 --> 59:00.421
Bravo, well... very well done, very, I'm very impressed.
Kind of. Kinda impressed. Not Really.

59:00.807 --> 59:02.611
- That'll do. - Yeah? - Yeah.

59:02.611 --> 59:04.977
- Yeah, she wants you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:07.793 --> 59:10.369
<i>Nooooooo!</i>

59:12.808 --> 59:13.642
<i>Ghostface.....</i>

59:22.785 --> 59:25.089
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

59:26.090 --> 59:30.124
<i>- Who is this?</i>
<i>- Were you expecting somebody now?</i>

59:37.465 --> 59:40.947
<i>You know, I don't even know you...</i>
<i>- ...and I dislike you already.</i>

59:41.260 --> 59:45.129
- Hicks, how far are you from 4th Dylan Road?
- 5 minutes at the most, Sir.

59:45.129 --> 59:45.890
Well, step on it.

59:48.287 --> 59:49.538
<i>Look out your window.</i>

01:00:35.008 --> 01:00:37.343
Gale! Gale, behind you!

01:00:49.655 --> 01:00:50.208
No!

01:00:54.212 --> 01:00:55.046
Gale!

01:01:10.602 --> 01:01:11.436
Freeze!

01:01:25.209 --> 01:01:26.814
Get out of the way, you morons!

01:01:32.339 --> 01:01:33.246
Dammit.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.962
- Ok, put pressure on that.
- Did you catch him?

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:45.216
- No, hopefully your cameras got something.
- They weren't the only ones, Dewey.

01:01:45.216 --> 01:01:48.480
- What?
- There's a webcam... set back there.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.305
- He was watching me.
- A webcam?

01:01:51.753 --> 01:01:54.328
- He's recording the murders.
- What?

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.228
This time... he's making the movie.

01:02:02.816 --> 01:02:07.028
This Sidney Prescott detail man, I don't like it.

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:09.874
The cops scouting the house, they always get it.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.773
What are you talking about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.880
Sucks to be a cop in a movie.
Unless you re Bruce Willis.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.831
- Not all cops die in movies.

01:02:20.457 --> 01:02:24.002
No, but if it's your last day before retirement you do.

01:02:24.805 --> 01:02:27.588
If you re a rookie, some with a
wife who's pregnant, you do.

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:33.218
Or if your partner is better looking than you,
you do, and by the way, I win that one.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:38.234
You know what, I'll take the next perimeter. I'll be right back.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.393
Shit.

01:02:41.393 --> 01:02:44.840
- I know this one, you re not supposed
to say that, are you?

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.480
- Eh, new decade, new rules.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.720
You know, these days, you might come
back, find me dead. Eyes gouged out, tongue

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.600
sticking out. Could go either way.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.322
- I gotta learn this shit.
- Eh, I'll take this one.

01:02:58.752 --> 01:03:03.944
- Hey, Hoss. Be careful.
- I am always careful.

01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:09.542
Dead man walking.

01:03:59.807 --> 01:04:07.220
- Perkins, was there a window open on your last
perimeter check? Perkins, come in. Over.

01:04:38.247 --> 01:04:38.737
Anthony?

01:04:41.033 --> 01:04:41.554
Perkins?

01:04:47.225 --> 01:04:51.093
- Dammit.
- You should have seen the look on your face, rookie.

01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:55.441
Hoss! What the fuck!

01:04:57.557 --> 01:04:58.599
Holy shit...

01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:10.152
Hoss!

01:05:27.198 --> 01:05:28.345
Fuck Bruce Willis!

01:05:57.601 --> 01:06:02.992
- Sorry. The wind chimes were over here.
- It was me, I was trying to fix em, sorry.

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:07.934
- I am just back the store.
- Were you shopping?

01:06:08.247 --> 01:06:12.385
A stress buster. I got one more bag
in the car. I'll be right back.

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:40.118
Jill, you re gonna get that?

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.803
<i>- Roberts residence.</i>
<i>- You re a survivor, aren't you, Sidney?</i>

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:53.193
<i>Your one and only skill: You survive.</i>
<i>Well, I have one question for you.</i>

01:06:53.818 --> 01:06:58.375
<i>What good did to be a survivor in this little</i>
drama if everyone close to you is dead?

01:06:58.896 --> 01:07:01.888
<i>- Who are you?</i>
<i>- Turn on the TV to channel 6.</i>

01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:05.340
<i>- Who the fuck are you?</i>
<i>- Turn it on. Watch the teaser.</i>

01:07:07.247 --> 01:07:11.360
...But it nearly turned deadly tonight, with
the latest victim of this attack being

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.232
the wife of the Woodsboro Sheriff...

01:07:13.232 --> 01:07:18.400
...Gale Riley, AKA Gale Weathers, who's in
serious condition tonight after being stabbed.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.437
Her assailant then disappeared...

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:25.515
<i>in a sea of identic.... - Glad you came home,</i>
Sidney. Has it been worth it yet?

01:07:25.515 --> 01:07:27.360
- Why are you doing this?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.572
- Ah, friends count, but it's the family
ties that cut deep. Am I right?

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.560
- What do you mean?

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.870
- The ones you care about most.
And what's closer than family?

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:40.715
<i>- The bond of blood.</i>
<i>- Don't.</i>

01:07:41.205 --> 01:07:45.137
<i>You can't save them. All you can do is watch.</i>

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:47.357
Jill!

01:08:06.187 --> 01:08:07.917
- Kate!
- Sid?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.940
- She's not in her room.
- Oh my God.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.920
She's gone at Kirby's. You gotta
call her, get her back here.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.130
- Ok.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.413
<i>- Come on, Jill!</i>
<i>- Leave a message.</i>

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.880
- She's not picking up. What's going on?

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.670
- The killer called, he's coming after
me. But he wants my family first.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.380
- Oh God, Jill...
- Let's get the cops.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.215
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:28.800
They were there when I first came
in, but they re not there now.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.697
- Let's get to Kirby's.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.024
Out the front.

01:08:43.647 --> 01:08:46.013
Press up on the bottom. Can you?

01:08:52.447 --> 01:08:53.281
Let's get out of here.

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:57.316
Kate, come on! Kate!

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:13.602
- Tell Jill I am so sorry...
- No, no, no, no, shhhh...

01:09:25.008 --> 01:09:25.852
Kate...

01:09:42.575 --> 01:09:43.880
- Hicks. What are you doing?

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.546
- I just saw somebody coming
around the side of the house.

01:09:46.651 --> 01:09:48.559
Where are Hoss and Perkins? I
couldn't get em on the radio.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.483
- Whose blood is that?
- Is... Is Kate's, we were just attacked. She's dead.

01:09:55.588 --> 01:09:57.745
- Where is she?
- The front door.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.518
- Show me.
- Ok.

01:10:04.429 --> 01:10:05.440
- Stay here.
- Ok.

01:10:11.737 --> 01:10:17.191
This is Deputy Hicks. I've got a homicide at the
Roberts residence. No sign of Perkins or Hoss.

01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:20.151
- Copy that. We'll try to locate em.
- I'm so sorry.

01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:38.377
You're gonna be fine, alright? I swear. No more
on your own. It's you and me, forever.

01:10:40.952 --> 01:10:41.681
Easy.

01:10:43.422 --> 01:10:44.850
- Dewey.
- Yeah?

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.510
Promise me something.
- Anything.

01:10:50.722 --> 01:10:56.122
- Catch that motherfucker.
- Absolutely. I love you.

01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:57.029
I love you.

01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:03.952
- It was chaos. Utter chaos.
- I can't believe that.

01:11:03.952 --> 01:11:08.372
The Sheriff's wife, man. She told us to cancel it and we
didn't and now this? What are we supposed to do?

01:11:08.372 --> 01:11:10.352
Robbie, calm down. It makes sense.

01:11:10.769 --> 01:11:13.450
- This is about the reboots too. They-they-they
one up the original ending.

01:11:13.762 --> 01:11:17.160
- "The Woodsboro murders" ended
at a party, so in the remake...

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.601
- ...The party is the false ending. New rules.

01:11:19.883 --> 01:11:23.886
- Exactly.
- Ok, no offense guys but I'm gonna put in Stab 7.

01:11:23.886 --> 01:11:25.658
- Yes...
- Nobody cancels my film festival.

01:11:25.939 --> 01:11:29.640
Wohaa, I don't wanna watch that.
Not after what happened to Olivia.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.611
- Oh, come on. It was her favorite.

01:11:31.611 --> 01:11:35.230
Oh, wow Kirby. You have some classics here.
- Yep.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.080
"Suspiria","Don't look now"...

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.069
- You know it. I can trivia your ass
under the table, cinema boy.

01:11:41.069 --> 01:11:45.312
Oh, yeah? Who played Leatherface first?
- Gunnar Hansen.

01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:48.199
Wow, did you feel that?

01:11:49.732 --> 01:11:54.498
- The charge that moved between us, then?
- Oh, that was me. I have powers.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.103
So sexy...

01:11:57.177 --> 01:12:00.760
You guys are unbelievable. You re playing fucking
trivia games? The cops are gonna come for

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.400
us, they are gonna shut down my website.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.756
- We re so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

01:12:04.756 --> 01:12:06.520
- Jesus Christ, where did you come from?

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.053
- The front door. By the way Kirby, with
everything that's going on right now...

01:12:10.053 --> 01:12:14.223
...you probably shouldn't leave that unlocked.
- Sorry...

01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:20.552
- And... May I ask what the hell are you doing here?
- Why, didn't I find the after-party?

01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:26.891
- No, you found the Anti-party and it's invitation only.
- Yeah, well, I got an invitation. From Jill.

01:12:29.247 --> 01:12:33.115
So, what's the story?
- What?

01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:39.235
- You sent me a text message.After-party at Kirby's
house. I mean, it was from your phone.

01:12:39.235 --> 01:12:47.065
What do you mean, from my phone? Oh, where is my
phone? I think I left it in your car, I didn't text him.

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:51.381
I didn't text you. And I'll prove it!

01:12:53.289 --> 01:12:58.472
So, Charlie, Robbie, how does it feel
to be accessories to a crime, huh?

01:12:58.858 --> 01:13:02.475
- I mean, really? Dewey's wife?
- My life is over.

01:13:02.684 --> 01:13:05.436
So which one of you guys sent me a
text message from Jill's phone, huh?

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.640
- W-We re just supposed to accept
that you re telling the truth?

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.151
- Isn't your phone missing?

01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:18.542
- Got a new one.
- Really? Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.275
Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.985
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:29.124
- And Sidney fled the scene.
- What, what happened to Kate?

01:13:29.645 --> 01:13:32.284
- She was stabbed, just like the others.
- And what about Jill?

01:13:32.711 --> 01:13:36.256
- No sign of her at all
- Where the hell were Hoss and Perkins?

01:13:36.882 --> 01:13:42.199
<i>They were found dead in their car two</i>
<i>blocks away. Multiple stab wounds.</i>

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:47.871
<i>Ok. I'm on my way.</i>
<i>- Yes, Sir.</i>

01:13:55.773 --> 01:13:58.454
<i>- Wrong number.</i>
<i>- Who was that?</i>

01:13:59.006 --> 01:14:00.956
<i>- Oh, nobody.</i>
<i>- Did you pick a movie?</i>

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:06.658
<i>- Yeah, we re gonna go scary: Saw IV.</i>
<i>- Oh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks.</i>

01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:10.068
<i>It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit.</i>

01:14:10.068 --> 01:14:12.017
<i>Why, angry feel.</i>

01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:16.640
- Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he
kills people very creatively.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.867
- But she don't give a shit who dies...

01:14:18.867 --> 01:14:23.007
<i>...cos there's no character to fill a man. It's just</i>
<i>body parts whipping and blood spewing...</i>

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.268
Charlie, you wanna sit next to me?

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:50.720
Alright... Get ready for a Hall Pass with
Robbie Mercer extra. Now tonight, there

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.763
is a good chance that Charlie Walker,

01:14:54.045 --> 01:15:02.080
yes, my Charlie Walker, may get lucky with
a girl. Now I'm unable to, to publish my exact

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.660
location, however, suffice it to say...

01:15:06.077 --> 01:15:11.718
Woodsboro High may be in store
for some geek history. We'll see.

01:15:25.783 --> 01:15:26.950
Hello?

01:15:30.328 --> 01:15:31.474
Who's there?

01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:38.741
Oh my God.

01:15:52.733 --> 01:15:55.517
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
<i>- To make sure the front door is locked.</i>

01:15:57.946 --> 01:16:00.909
<i>- No, don't open it.</i>
<i>- You're overreacting.</i>

01:16:03.754 --> 01:16:04.766
Hey, Charlie.
- Yeah?

01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:13.461
I'm sorry, I know you re into the movie and all, but... now
would be a really good time to make a move.

01:16:14.962 --> 01:16:18.434
- For me to make a move?
- Mhh mhh.

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.970
- Couldn't you make a move?
- I just did.

01:16:25.566 --> 01:16:33.958
Cos you re actually pretty cute. Especially
when I'm scared... and lonely... and drunk.

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:42.360
Ehi, guys. Did... did you see Jill, coming?
I didn't see her outside.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.916
- Yes, Trevor. She is upstairs.

01:16:45.438 --> 01:16:48.430
Thank God you re here to protect
her when you can't even find her.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.440
- There's nobody out here.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.905
- Oh, dude. I love this part of
the movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:55.905 --> 01:16:56.840
- What is it say?

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.356
- Just when you think they're all safe
and comfortable in the house

01:17:00.846 --> 01:17:03.173
Ghostface comes in and bang!

01:17:06.936 --> 01:17:15.632
- Did I interrupt something for you? Shut the fuck up.
- Who invited you, Trevor?

01:17:16.153 --> 01:17:20.187
Alright. Clearly not you. Wow.

01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:25.578
- I'm moving upstairs.
- Get out of my house!

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:34.315
Ehi, ok, I'm a little drunk so, don't
blame your Internet connection.

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:41.061
Let's see what Charlie is up to, shall
we? Or the saga of Trevor and Jill...

01:17:41.446 --> 01:17:45.513
Oh, intrigue of Woodsboro High. Who needs
to kill around with so much drama?

01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:01.589
Oh, man...

01:18:03.465 --> 01:18:06.251
Yeah... That's better.

01:18:20.471 --> 01:18:23.401
Wait, no! You can't, you can't, there's rules.

01:18:23.505 --> 01:18:27.916
I-I-I'm gay, I'm gay. I mean, if it helps...

01:18:35.047 --> 01:18:38.289
<i>...some random girl who gets a call that</i>
<i>undoubtedly ends up getting her killed.</i>

01:18:38.289 --> 01:18:41.970
<i>It's all so predictable. There's no element</i>
<i>of surprise. You can see ev...</i>

01:18:56.734 --> 01:19:03.895
Kirby! So, my phone was up in your room. There was
no text message sent to Trevor. He is such a liar.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:05.680
- Where is he?

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.901
- What do you mean, where is he, he
just went upstairs looking for you.

01:19:09.944 --> 01:19:18.681
- He's not upstairs.
- Trevor! Charlie! Robbie!

01:19:19.994 --> 01:19:21.183
Maybe they are outside.

01:19:22.642 --> 01:19:26.240
Jill...................................... No, it's ok, just I need
you to come with me. Sidney! I am sorry, I should

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.553
have told you and mom where I was going.

01:19:27.553 --> 01:19:32.141
Come with me right now, ok? Run.

01:19:32.423 --> 01:19:33.184
Robbie!

01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:37.531
Go!

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:41.919
Sidney!

01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:45.183
Come on!

01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:51.137
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

01:19:51.658 --> 01:19:53.000
- We can jump?

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.196
- It's two stories. Where's your
cell? Get under the bed.

01:19:58.196 --> 01:19:58.440
- What?

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.531
- Just do what I say. Get under the bed and don't make
a sound and don't come out till I come get you.

01:20:01.531 --> 01:20:03.345
- Just go. Trust me!
- Ok.

01:20:11.176 --> 01:20:14.794
You got it? You ok? Jill, run. Just keep running. Get out!

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:42.339
- Hello?
- Dewey!

01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:46.343
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's. The killer is here, I need your help.

01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:47.948
- I'm on my way.
- Ok.

01:20:51.077 --> 01:20:52.401
Sid! Sidney!

01:20:53.089 --> 01:20:57.718
- I need all units to 329 Whispering Lane.
- All units! 329 Whispering Lane!

01:21:18.737 --> 01:21:23.147
Sorry, it's just me. Look, I tried to call 911 with the
land line instead, but someone smashed the router.

01:21:23.147 --> 01:21:25.274
I think I called them myself
- Well, where's Jill?

01:21:26.661 --> 01:21:28.714
Go, go, go, go!

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:35.190
- There's a room down there. We can lock ourselves in.

01:21:35.638 --> 01:21:38.870
- I heard you yelling to Jill. Did she get away?
- I think she's safe.

01:21:47.086 --> 01:21:49.483
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie...

01:21:52.059 --> 01:21:56.406
No, no, no, no, no, don't. I just found Robbie.
It's... It's just his blood, please.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:22:00.859
- Please, there is someone else out here. Let me in.
- If you can't trust him, don't open the door.

01:22:02.839 --> 01:22:06.009
- My God! Let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie.

01:22:06.457 --> 01:22:10.356
- Kirby, it's me! Please let me in!
- Get away from the door, Charlie!

01:22:10.356 --> 01:22:15.508
- It's me!
- I'm sorry, I can't...

01:22:15.789 --> 01:22:18.604
What the fuck...
- I am sorry.

01:22:19.542 --> 01:22:20.824
Behind you! Look out!

01:22:23.577 --> 01:22:25.766
No, no, no, no, no!

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:28.696
Kirby!

01:22:39.237 --> 01:22:42.365
Oh, no, God, no. He's... Leave him alone!

01:22:43.334 --> 01:22:44.731
Leave him alone!

01:22:48.036 --> 01:22:49.920
- It's Charlie's phone.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:56.242
- Tell Sidney heads are gonna roll tonight.
Tell Sidney it's all because of her.

01:22:56.242 --> 01:23:00.960
- Or maybe she wants into his
place. I promise to be quick.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.987
- It's him.

01:23:01.987 --> 01:23:06.365
Ok, I'm gonna get Jill, she should be in the same place.
Just-just keep him on the phone, I'll be right back ok?

01:23:09.597 --> 01:23:11.080
- Let him go, please...

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.791
- I hear you like horror movies, Kirby.
But do you like em so much as him?

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:22.891
<i>- Forget watching Stab. You get to live it.</i>
<i>- No, no, no, no, no. He's the expert, it's not me.</i>

01:23:22.891 --> 01:23:27.447
<i>- Warm up question: Jason's weapon?</i>
<i>- Uh, it's a machete.</i>

01:23:27.447 --> 01:23:31.920
- There, you see? You do know
the genre. Michael Mayers?

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.609
- Uh, butcher knife.

01:23:33.609 --> 01:23:36.393
- Leatherface?
- A chainsaw. Please...

01:23:36.393 --> 01:23:39.200
- Just ask Sidney if you need
some help. Freddy Krueger?

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.386
- Uh, uh, razor hands.

01:23:40.386 --> 01:23:44.280
- Name the movie that started the slasher craze:
"Halloween", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre",

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.130
"The Last House on the Left" or "Psycho"?

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.880
- "Psycho".

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.135
- None of the above. "Peeping Tom".
1960, directed by Michael Powell.

01:23:51.135 --> 01:23:54.920
- First movie to ever put the
audience in the killer's POV.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.849
- Wait, wait. No, no, no, no.

01:23:56.849 --> 01:24:00.600
- Please, just ask me one more
question, just one more.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.919
- Alright, Kirby. Then it's time
for your last chance question.

01:24:04.919 --> 01:24:09.756
<i>- Name the remake of the groundbreaking</i>
<i>horror movie in which the villain...</i>

01:24:09.756 --> 01:24:14.600
"Halloween", "Texas Chainsaw", "Dawn of the
Dead", "The Hills Have Eyes", "The Amityville

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.680
Horror", "The Last House on the Left"

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:22.549
"Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody
Valentine", "When a Stranger Calls", "Prom Night"

01:24:22.549 --> 01:24:30.066
"Black Christmas", "House of Wax", "The Fog",
uh, "Piranha". It's one of those, right? Right?!

01:24:37.896 --> 01:24:41.275
I got it right. I was fucking right!

01:24:41.546 --> 01:24:42.318
Jill?

01:24:54.839 --> 01:24:59.960
- I won, Charlie. I fucking won. I won. He
tried to beat me, but I fucking won.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.240
- It's so great...

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:13.001
- Wait, I'm almost there. Just hang tight.
- Kirby? This is making a move.

01:25:16.682 --> 01:25:22.875
- 4 years of classes together and you notice
me now? You stupid bitch! It's too late!

01:25:24.689 --> 01:25:29.767
- Shh, shhhh, I know, I know. It's ok, take your time.

01:25:29.767 --> 01:25:33.720
- Doesn't happen as fast as it
does in the movies, honey.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.666
- Charlie...

01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:02.609
Kirby?

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.803
You know, you learn the law when you
watch the movies over and over.

01:26:10.293 --> 01:26:12.169
All the plots are about trying to kill you.

01:26:14.191 --> 01:26:15.040
- Where's Jill?

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.614
- Oh, you think she's gonna get away?
You think anyone gets away?

01:26:29.111 --> 01:26:33.220
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney. Surprised?

01:26:34.085 --> 01:26:41.602
Watch this. This is the part when, dear
cousin, the cameras... turn off.

01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:48.035
- Charlie?
- Want her taken care of.

01:26:48.702 --> 01:26:53.706
Then I got great footage in my Robbie kill. Better
than Jenny and Marnie or Olivia even.

01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:56.741
Good. We'll cut and upload it later.
Make it all traceable to Trevor.

01:26:56.741 --> 01:27:02.820
Speaking of which... Remind you of anything?

01:27:03.309 --> 01:27:05.676
- Jill, please...
- Shut up! Dick.

01:27:05.676 --> 01:27:10.410
- Everything I learned, I learned from you.
- You think you had a shitty boyfriend, Sidney?

01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:16.200
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you
and doesn't even make you famous.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.177
- What the fuck, Jill, I loved you!

01:27:19.177 --> 01:27:21.441
- Shut the fuck up, already!

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.206
Sure those cops wanted you to have
this, Jill. For your protection.

01:27:28.259 --> 01:27:29.093
Put it dow...

01:27:32.533 --> 01:27:33.520
- Ehi, please.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:38.487
- Shouldn't have killed all those people;
Trev. Gone and put it on video even.

01:27:39.029 --> 01:27:43.356
- But it means a lot that you did it for me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:27:43.356 --> 01:27:46.380
I am NOT the girl you cheat on.

01:27:51.697 --> 01:27:55.200
- I've gone thru everything. We're
definitely good on timeline.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.711
- Oh, yeah. We're perfect.

01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:58.349
No, no, no. Please.

01:28:05.824 --> 01:28:07.148
Ready for act 3?

01:28:08.608 --> 01:28:14.457
- Have figured it out yet, Sidney? Keeping it to our remake
theme, Trevor is this generation's Billy Loomis

01:28:14.728 --> 01:28:17.824
and we're the innocent victims: Sidney and Randy.

01:28:18.106 --> 01:28:24.581
See, with you, the world just heard about what
happened but with us, they're gonna see it.

01:28:24.581 --> 01:28:30.701
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation. And people gotta
see this shit. It's not like anyone reads anymore.

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.968
I gonna know fame like you never even dreamed of.

01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:51.783
Last two teenagers standing. This time Randy gets the
girl. You're amazing. And you're the perfect victim.

01:28:52.544 --> 01:28:59.240
I was so believable today, wasn't I? I mean, I
told so many lies, I actually started to believe

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.532
them. I really think that I was born for this.

01:29:02.532 --> 01:29:04.560
- How could you do this?

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.277
- Do you know what it was like
growing up in this family?

01:29:09.528 --> 01:29:17.597
Related to you? I mean, all I ever heard was: Sidney
this and Sidney that, and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

01:29:18.046 --> 01:29:23.320
- You were always so fucking special!
Well, now I am the special one.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.668
- You'll slip, they always do.

01:29:27.055 --> 01:29:34.680
- Come on, Charlie. Let's go on with this.
You have to be strong and hold still. Ok?

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:42.015
- Yeah, yeah, old school, like Billy and Stu.
Come on, baby, get it up. Come on.

01:29:43.099 --> 01:29:45.633
Shoulder me, shoulder me, shoulder me. Get it up!

01:29:52.035 --> 01:29:53.703
Not the way we rehearsed it.

01:29:53.703 --> 01:29:57.050
You said it, Charlie: Billy and Stu. Trevor and you.

01:29:58.405 --> 01:30:06.720
What the media really loves, baby, is a sole survivor.
Just ask you know who. Trevor was your

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:10.301
partner and you, you were the idea man.

01:30:20.383 --> 01:30:22.520
- Even your friends?

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:30.445
- My friends? What world are you living
in? I don't need friends. I need fans.

01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:38.901
Don't you get it?! This has never been about
killing you. It's about... becoming you.

01:30:39.557 --> 01:30:45.364
I mean, for fuck's sake, my own mother had to die, no
great loss there, so I could stay true to the original.

01:30:45.927 --> 01:30:54.446
It's sick, right? Well sick is the new sane. You
had your 15 minutes, no I want mine!

01:30:55.457 --> 01:31:01.800
I mean, what am I supposed to do? Go to college,
grad school, work? Look around, we all

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.226
live in public now, we re all on the Internet.

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:12.160
How do you think people become famous anymore?
You don't have to achieve anything. You just

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.287
gotta have fucked up shit happen to you.

01:31:16.184 --> 01:31:22.240
So, you do have to die Sid. Those are the
rules. New movie, new franchise. There's

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.410
only room for one lead and, let's face it,

01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:28.227
your ingenue days, they are over.

01:31:34.868 --> 01:31:36.890
Don't tell me you didn't know this day would come.

01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.236
Oh, fuck!

01:34:20.006 --> 01:34:21.227
Come on! Let's move in!

01:34:31.662 --> 01:34:34.104
- Check the rooms, both sides and upstairs.
- Yes Ma'm.

01:34:52.087 --> 01:35:10.521
Jill can you give us a description... Over here... Jill... Jill,
how does it feel to be a hero?...

01:35:21.969 --> 01:35:28.652
- Jill. You made it. That's all that matters.
- True, Charlie and Trev tried to kill me.

01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:34.080
And I heard they killed my mom.
And Robbie and Kirby too.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.452
- Shhh. Just lay back. Try to rest.

01:35:39.537 --> 01:35:44.020
- Is-is your wife...
- She's gonna be fine. She's tough.

01:35:46.981 --> 01:35:53.040
If I ever write a book one day I'd, I'd want
her to write it with me. It'd be a good team

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.363
with our matching wounds and all.

01:35:58.533 --> 01:36:10.012
We're survivors now. I just wish Sidney was too.
- Jill, they re not sure yet. It's still touch and go.

01:36:11.054 --> 01:36:15.611
But she's in ICU (intensive care unit) and
they think Sidney just might make it.

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:25.735
What? I mean, I saw Trevor kill her.
- Look, we don't know yet. But she's hanging on.

01:36:29.009 --> 01:36:30.600
I-I-I wanna se her.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:38.018
- She's not awake yet. And, she may not remember
anything. You'll have to help her with that.

01:36:39.477 --> 01:36:42.605
All in time. Just get some rest now, ok?

01:37:31.659 --> 01:37:36.736
- She gonna be ok?
- Yeah, she's a strong kid.

01:37:36.736 --> 01:37:38.960
- She's gonna have to be.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.537
- She asked if you were ok. She thinks
you guys should write a book together.

01:37:45.537 --> 01:37:49.331
- With your matching wounds.
- Why, she was stabbed in the shoulder?

01:37:53.679 --> 01:38:01.509
- How did she know I was too?
- Shit!

01:38:08.255 --> 01:38:17.618
You just won't die, will ya? Who are you, Michael
fucking Mayers? Yeah, I don't think so.

01:38:22.998 --> 01:38:24.645
Fucking die already!

01:38:48.302 --> 01:38:49.865
How are those stitches?

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:55.986
<i>Sidney!</i>

01:39:00.406 --> 01:39:03.240
- Hicks, get to the Sidney Prescott's
room and call for backup!

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.128
- Be right up, Sir.

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:16.128
- Sid? Sid.
- Dewey!

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:39.280
Is this how it's gonna be, Sid? The ending
of the movie was supposed to be at

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.495
the house. I mean, this is just... silly.

01:39:42.016 --> 01:39:47.230
Consider this an alternate ending. You're
not gonna get out of this, Jill.

01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:48.658
- Of course I will.
- Dewey?

01:39:50.639 --> 01:39:51.338
Sid...

01:39:52.516 --> 01:39:59.126
- Easy..Wait, wait. What about the book?
- Looks like I'll just have to write it myself.

01:40:01.357 --> 01:40:02.399
Goddammit!

01:40:04.725 --> 01:40:07.718
Don't even think about shooting or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:12.691
- What, you think I won't do it? Give me your gun!
- Do it.

01:40:22.918 --> 01:40:27.277
You just had to be the hero, huh? Give me your gun.

01:40:30.091 --> 01:40:34.440
What are you, deaf? Give me... your gun.

01:40:42.112 --> 01:40:48.911
- And get up. And keep your hands over your head.
- Don't do anything stupi...

01:40:50.808 --> 01:40:52.841
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

01:40:53.571 --> 01:40:56.771
- Oh, God...
- Now, get up bitch.

01:40:57.367 --> 01:41:02.026
- Ok.
- Get up. Now!

01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:17.155
- Ok...
- Come on. Let's go. Get your skinny ass out here.

01:41:18.583 --> 01:41:23.942
- Ok...
- I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off.

01:41:25.016 --> 01:41:32.950
Ok, but can I just have one final word?
- What? Please?

01:41:35.568 --> 01:41:36.360
- No...

01:41:39.561 --> 01:41:41.406
- Clear.
- Clear?

01:41:41.896 --> 01:41:42.521
Clear!

01:41:48.403 --> 01:41:52.291
You forgot the first rule of remakes,
Jill: Don't fuck with the original.

01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:00.820
- Oh my God, Dewey.
- Uh, what hit me?

01:42:01.414 --> 01:42:06.074
Don't ask. You ok?

01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:14.697
- She was standing right behind?
- They always are.

01:42:27.636 --> 01:42:31.149
- Oh, God...
- Nice one.

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:39.261
- Hicks, you're alive?
- Wear the vest, save your chest.

01:42:42.253 --> 01:42:47.955
I got two officers down, several injuries and a new suspect.

01:42:50.084 --> 01:42:52.408
We need a doctor, Goddammit!

01:42:53.315 --> 01:42:55.609
I dunno about you, but I feel a whole lot better.

01:42:59.539 --> 01:43:05.836
We're live at Woodsboro Community Hospital, awaiting
a first public statement from Jill Roberts, survivor.

01:43:05.836 --> 01:43:10.362
...a survivor of what is now being called
"the Woodsboro Massacre reboot"...

01:43:10.362 --> 01:43:13.949
...Jill Roberts is her name. A name
the whole world will now know...

01:43:13.949 --> 01:43:19.130
...who single-handedly put a stop to this
21st century Woodsboro killing spree...

01:43:19.130 --> 01:43:25.400
...Jill Roberts of Woodsboro, a girl who's
lifted all our spirits tonight. An American

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.648
hero, right out of the movies.
