Two one six four two zero

00:04.121 --> 00:06.059
one nine eight nine.

00:06.061 --> 00:09.836
And that, little lady,
is pi to a thousand places.

00:09.838 --> 00:11.868
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

00:11.870 --> 00:14.137
except I didn't.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.572
Oh, look, it's the
<i>Scientific American</i>

00:16.574 --> 00:19.384
that covered the paper
Leonard and I wrote.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.354
Oh, let me see.

00:21.356 --> 00:23.989
I have mixed feelings
about doing interviews.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.159
I like the part where I talk.

00:26.161 --> 00:29.833
I do not like the part
where the other man talks.

00:31.236 --> 00:34.107
Sheldon, this article doesn't
mention Leonard at all.

00:34.109 --> 00:35.876
Well, that
can't be right.

00:35.878 --> 00:38.948
It only refers to
“Dr. Cooper and his team.”

00:38.950 --> 00:40.845
Did you even talk about him?

00:40.847 --> 00:43.420
All I did was answer a few
questions about the theory.

00:43.422 --> 00:45.588
And then expressed my gratitude
that <i> Scientific American</i>

00:45.590 --> 00:49.052
doesn't include any of those
smelly perfume cards.

00:49.054 --> 00:51.691
Poor Leonard.

00:51.693 --> 00:54.026
Why? The theory
he came up with

00:54.028 --> 00:55.690
just got mentioned in
<i>Scientific American.</i>

00:55.692 --> 00:57.058
He ought to be thrilled.

00:57.060 --> 00:58.499
He might not be.

00:58.501 --> 01:00.530
Oh, maybe you're right.

01:00.532 --> 01:02.865
He is kind of a lump.

01:02.867 --> 01:04.000
Think about it.

01:04.001 --> 01:05.937
How would you feel
if you were referred to

01:05.939 --> 01:07.642
as part of Leonard's team?

01:07.644 --> 01:09.908
Oh, I'd be incensed.

01:09.910 --> 01:12.413
So you see what
I'm getting at?

01:12.415 --> 01:14.984
Squeaky wheel
gets the grease?

01:14.986 --> 01:16.386
No.

01:16.388 --> 01:18.290
Grass is always greener?

01:18.292 --> 01:19.995
Try again.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.659
Well, I don't know--
we're all Groot?

01:21.661 --> 01:23.764
Just tell me.

01:23.766 --> 01:25.836
Leonard is as much
a part of this paper

01:25.838 --> 01:27.900
as you are,
and he was overlooked.

01:27.902 --> 01:29.869
He's going to feel bad.

01:29.871 --> 01:32.141
But it wasn't my fault.

01:32.143 --> 01:33.676
I didn't exclude him.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.276
And I didn't write the article.

01:35.278 --> 01:38.348
Remember that time you didn't
get picked to pull the sword out

01:38.350 --> 01:41.579
of the stone at Disneyland and
they let that other kid do it?

01:41.581 --> 01:43.788
Oh, that kid!

01:46.592 --> 01:50.033
Poor Leonard.

01:50.035 --> 01:51.833
Exactly.

01:51.835 --> 01:54.265
For the record,
that kid was a terrible choice.

01:54.267 --> 01:56.034
If you cry when you drop
your churro,

01:56.036 --> 01:58.611
you do not have what it takes
to rule England.

02:29.204 --> 02:32.267
Thanks for helping us sort
through all my mom's stuff.

02:32.269 --> 02:33.908
Of course.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.173
I know what it's like

02:35.175 --> 02:37.844
having to go through
a loved one's possessions.

02:37.846 --> 02:40.485
My uncle was
a worshipper of Krishna.

02:40.487 --> 02:43.086
But after he died,
you know what we found?

02:43.088 --> 02:46.285
A statue of Shiva.

02:48.623 --> 02:50.292
It may not be
Crips and Bloods, okay?

02:50.294 --> 02:52.554
But in India, it's a thing.

02:54.123 --> 02:55.888
Well, it'll be good
that you're there.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.160
Howard's been having
trouble deciding

02:57.162 --> 02:59.096
what to keep
and what to let go.

02:59.098 --> 03:00.559
Well, it's hard.

03:00.561 --> 03:03.797
A lot of Ma's stuff
brings back fond memories.

03:03.799 --> 03:05.227
Is that why you couldn't
get rid of

03:05.229 --> 03:08.030
her drawer
full of ketchup packets?

03:08.032 --> 03:11.194
Yes. It reminds me of us
eating out and her saying,

03:11.196 --> 03:14.230
“Quick, nobody's looking,
fill your pockets with ketchup”"

03:21.563 --> 03:23.528
Leonard?

03:23.530 --> 03:26.631
Have you ever noticed that

03:26.633 --> 03:30.365
only my name is
on the cable bill?

03:30.367 --> 03:32.869
Yeah.

03:32.871 --> 03:35.574
Good, good.

03:35.576 --> 03:37.477
And your name is
on the electric bill

03:37.479 --> 03:39.373
and mine isn't.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.676
And I'm okay with that.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.148
Actually, your name is
on the electric bill.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.083
Oh, right.

03:46.885 --> 03:49.984
This is a disaster.

03:49.986 --> 03:53.416
I don't even know what you're
talking about and I agree.

03:53.418 --> 03:57.122
Okay, I have
to tell you something,

03:57.124 --> 03:59.131
but you're not going to like it.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.532
What's going on?

04:00.534 --> 04:02.997
An article was just published

04:02.999 --> 04:06.006
in <i> Scientific American</i>
about our theory.

04:06.008 --> 04:07.607
Did they hate it?

04:07.609 --> 04:09.679
No. No, they loved it.

04:09.681 --> 04:12.278
They, uh, couldn't say enough
nice things about it.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.845
So what's the problem?

04:16.480 --> 04:19.317
You know how the <i> PennySaver</i>
only has my name...

04:19.320 --> 04:20.583
Sheldon!

04:20.584 --> 04:23.255
They didn't mention you
in the article.

04:23.257 --> 04:24.654
Only me.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.461
Really?

04:26.463 --> 04:27.589
I know.

04:27.591 --> 04:29.798
It's not fair.

04:32.202 --> 04:34.706
Let the anger
go, buddy.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.138
You just...

04:36.140 --> 04:38.843
you relax all
your muscles.

04:38.845 --> 04:41.578
Except for your pubococcygeus
and anal sphincter.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.146
Let's keep those tight.

04:44.148 --> 04:47.417
Uh, that-that's not necessary.

04:47.419 --> 04:50.015
It is-- they're what hold back
the urine and the feces.

04:50.017 --> 04:52.951
Look, maybe-maybe
you shouldn't read it.

04:52.953 --> 04:54.887
It'll only make you feel worse.

04:54.889 --> 04:57.423
“Cooper and his team”?

04:57.425 --> 04:59.897
You should know
I had nothing to do with that.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.962
Uh...

05:01.964 --> 05:04.634
at least they're talking
about the theory.

05:04.636 --> 05:06.865
I mean, that's what's important.

05:06.867 --> 05:09.337
You know, you're right.

05:09.339 --> 05:12.409
Yeah. You know, it's like
when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

05:12.411 --> 05:14.178
created Spider-Man.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.011
Stan Lee may get all the credit,

05:16.013 --> 05:18.988
but Steve Ditko knows
he was just as important.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.883
Even though Stan Lee gets
to be in all the Marvel movies.

05:21.885 --> 05:23.521
And-and he's far richer.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.719
And he's a household name,
you know?

05:25.721 --> 05:28.023
Whereas, you know,
you say Ditko,

05:28.025 --> 05:30.694
and that sounds like
a company that makes Dits.

05:32.927 --> 05:34.998
That's not helping.

05:36.496 --> 05:38.366
Well, I'd give more examples,

05:38.368 --> 05:41.839
but, well, everyone in
your position's so forgettable.

05:44.273 --> 05:46.606
Stuart, we're here.

05:46.608 --> 05:49.478
It's nice of you to let him keep
staying at your mom's house.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.078
Yeah, well, I tried putting him
out on the curb,

05:52.080 --> 05:53.949
but nobody took him.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.549
Hey.

05:56.551 --> 05:58.548
Just so you know,
the power's out.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.747
What happened?

05:59.749 --> 06:02.050
I called,
they said a transformer blew.

06:02.052 --> 06:03.122
It's the whole block.

06:03.124 --> 06:04.354
Should be fixed by tomorrow.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.184
Wait, when did it go out?

06:06.186 --> 06:07.656
In the middle of the night.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.361
Oh, my God.

06:10.363 --> 06:12.730
Howie, what's wrong?

06:15.608 --> 06:17.239
It's all defrosting.

06:17.241 --> 06:18.904
It's okay. It's just food.

06:18.906 --> 06:21.683
It's not just food.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.747
This is the last food
my mother ever made.

06:25.789 --> 06:27.083
This is her
last brisket.

06:27.085 --> 06:28.755
This is her
last meatloaf.

06:28.757 --> 06:30.219
This is her last...

06:31.860 --> 06:34.824
I have no idea
what this is, but...

06:34.826 --> 06:37.695
it's the last one.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.295
Everything okay?

06:39.297 --> 06:40.495
No.

06:40.497 --> 06:43.495
All Ma's food is
gonna be ruined.

06:43.497 --> 06:45.903
Well, why don't we take it home
and put it in our freezer?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.534
You don't want
to do that.

06:47.536 --> 06:49.502
Refreezing not only
removes moisture,

06:49.504 --> 06:51.805
but it creates ice crystals
in the fibers of the meat

06:51.807 --> 06:54.708
that can compromise
its taste and texture.

06:56.046 --> 06:57.443
What? I saw a teachable moment.

06:57.445 --> 06:59.875
I dropped some culinary science.

07:01.916 --> 07:03.747
What should we do?

07:03.749 --> 07:06.083
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

07:06.085 --> 07:07.924
We're gonna eat it.

07:07.926 --> 07:09.820
There's, like, 20 pounds
of food in there.

07:09.822 --> 07:10.924
All you said

07:10.926 --> 07:12.493
was I had to get rid of things.

07:12.495 --> 07:15.495
You didn't say they couldn't
pass through my colon first.

07:15.497 --> 07:18.767
Howie...

07:18.769 --> 07:20.400
Okay.

07:20.402 --> 07:22.872
Then how about this?

07:22.874 --> 07:25.042
Let's invite everyone
over to dinner.

07:25.044 --> 07:29.050
It'll be like Ma's feeding us
one last time.

07:29.052 --> 07:31.954
I love that.

07:33.156 --> 07:35.586
Me, too.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.586
Oh, look,
we've got enough ketchup

07:37.588 --> 07:39.922
to cover every ounce of it.

07:42.331 --> 07:46.064
I mean, who even reads
<i>Scientific American?</i>

07:47.330 --> 07:50.934
It's kind of
a big deal.

07:50.936 --> 07:53.332
If it's such a big deal,
how come the biggest celebrity

07:53.334 --> 07:56.066
they could get for the cover
is a molecule?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.802
Can we please just
stop talking about it?

07:59.804 --> 08:01.674
I'm sorry.
What can I do?

08:01.676 --> 08:03.842
Nothing, I'm fine.
(sighs)

08:03.844 --> 08:06.146
No, no.
I'm gonna cheer you up.

08:06.148 --> 08:07.882
(clears throat)

08:07.884 --> 08:09.780
Here we go.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.052
What are we doing?

08:11.054 --> 08:12.852
I am taking you shopping.
Oh.

08:12.854 --> 08:16.524
My baby is sad, and I'm gonna
make him happy again.

08:16.526 --> 08:18.388
Look, I know shopping
cheers you up,

08:18.390 --> 08:20.395
but it's just not
really my thing.

08:20.397 --> 08:22.060
Well, what about
this helicopter

08:22.062 --> 08:23.731
you control with an iPad?

08:23.733 --> 08:26.634
Does it have
a camera in it?

08:26.636 --> 08:30.032
It does have
a camera in it.

08:30.034 --> 08:32.798
Baby's listening.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.565
(knocks)
SHELDON: Leonard?

08:34.567 --> 08:36.499
(knocks) Leonard?
(knocks) Leonard?

08:36.501 --> 08:37.602
What?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.873
I spoke to the reporter
at the magazine.

08:41.970 --> 08:44.273
What happened?
Did you tell him it was my idea?

08:44.275 --> 08:45.305
I did.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.145
Thank you. What did he say?

08:47.147 --> 08:49.977
He said they made
the editorial decision

08:49.979 --> 08:52.017
to only cite the lead scientist.

08:52.019 --> 08:54.521
Why did he think
you're the lead scientist?

08:54.523 --> 08:56.417
It was my idea!

08:56.419 --> 08:57.655
You know,
for an extra four bucks,

08:57.657 --> 08:59.590
I can have this thing
here tomorrow.

08:59.592 --> 09:01.758
Well, I know it
was your idea,

09:01.760 --> 09:04.926
but the reporter said he's been
following my work for a while,

09:04.928 --> 09:06.926
and the only reason they even
mentioned it in the magazine

09:06.928 --> 09:08.198
is 'cause my name is on it.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.030
You know what? I did it.
What's four bucks?

09:11.032 --> 09:12.965
If you're trying
to make me feel better,

09:12.967 --> 09:14.436
it's not working.

09:14.438 --> 09:17.171
Well... then what if I told you

09:17.173 --> 09:20.475
that I added your name
to the cable bill?

09:22.245 --> 09:24.676
No.
Oh.

09:24.678 --> 09:26.181
That's just as well.
They had me on hold

09:26.183 --> 09:28.211
for 20 minutes and I hung up.
I...

09:29.245 --> 09:32.022
(knocks) Leonard?
(knocks) Leonard?

09:32.024 --> 09:33.821
(knocks) Leonard?

09:35.959 --> 09:40.597
Also, Wolowitz invited us all
to dinner, so...

09:40.599 --> 09:43.333
I'm ready whenever you are.

09:51.655 --> 09:54.156
All he had was an idea.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.891
Well, that is an important part.

09:55.893 --> 09:57.156
Oh, please!

09:57.158 --> 09:59.093
I have ideas all day long.

09:59.095 --> 10:02.932
Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins
are allowed to pet people.

10:04.261 --> 10:08.697
A new clothing size between
medium and large called Marge.

10:09.698 --> 10:12.430
Snow White retold from
the point of view of Sneezy.

10:12.432 --> 10:14.500
Why won't Doc
prescribe him something?

10:14.502 --> 10:16.971
We finally find out.

10:16.973 --> 10:19.003
But Leonard's idea was good.

10:20.836 --> 10:24.104
Fine. Then Grumpy--
what's he so grumpy about?

10:24.106 --> 10:26.842
Maybe his girlfriend
won't take his side.

10:28.444 --> 10:30.948
I'm the one
who thought of it!

10:30.950 --> 10:33.018
Well, didn't he do
a lot of the work?

10:33.020 --> 10:35.154
But now he's happy
to let people think

10:35.156 --> 10:37.889
he's responsible for everything.

10:37.891 --> 10:41.120
And that's why you get
an iPad helicopter!

10:42.523 --> 10:46.129
Is it my fault I have a much
bigger reputation than he does?

10:46.131 --> 10:47.328
It's not your fault.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.231
Is it my fault
that my name came first

10:49.233 --> 10:50.894
on the paper alphabetically?

10:50.896 --> 10:52.102
Not your fault.

10:52.104 --> 10:53.933
Is it my fault
that when the reporter cited me

10:53.935 --> 10:56.035
as the lead scientist
I didn't correct him?

10:56.037 --> 10:58.801
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

11:00.339 --> 11:02.072
He always needs
all the attention.

11:02.074 --> 11:03.239
He's such a baby.

11:03.241 --> 11:04.806
I know, I know.

11:04.808 --> 11:07.406
I swear, he is never ever
playing with my helicopter.

11:10.975 --> 11:14.245
Okay, I'll start heating
some of this stuff up.

11:14.247 --> 11:15.517
Thanks.

11:15.519 --> 11:17.014
Oh, man.

11:17.016 --> 11:20.883
This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom...

11:20.885 --> 11:21.849
(chuckles)

11:21.851 --> 11:25.615
...a piece of cake
from my Bar Mitzvah.

11:25.617 --> 11:27.151
Did she throw
anything away?

11:27.153 --> 11:28.319
No.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.724
If I find my foreskin,
I'm gonna kill myself.

11:33.619 --> 11:36.822
Okay, so we've got, um,

11:36.824 --> 11:39.723
three briskets, four
meatloafs, one lasagna...

11:39.725 --> 11:41.522
No, that's noodle kugel.

11:41.524 --> 11:43.654
One Jewish lasagna...

11:44.721 --> 11:47.725
...two pound cakes that are
about eight pounds each,

11:47.727 --> 11:50.860
and one giant container
of matzah ball soup.

11:50.862 --> 11:55.228
Ma always kept it on hand,

11:55.230 --> 11:58.027
in case I got sick.

11:58.029 --> 12:02.834
She thought she could cure
anything with her cooking.

12:02.836 --> 12:05.937
Even the time
I got food poisoning.

12:07.772 --> 12:09.779
From her cooking.

12:11.614 --> 12:13.444
You okay?

12:13.446 --> 12:16.451
Yeah, I'm okay.

12:16.453 --> 12:17.987
Let's get started.

12:17.989 --> 12:19.649
You got it.

12:24.427 --> 12:27.623
(voice breaking): I'm never
gonna talk to her again.

12:35.652 --> 12:37.584
Should we tell
everyone not to come?

12:37.586 --> 12:40.683
No. I want to do this.

12:40.685 --> 12:43.754
Okay. Well, I'll keep
it together if you can.

12:43.756 --> 12:46.018
Okay. (chuckles)

12:46.988 --> 12:49.458
(voice breaking):
I'm not making any promises!

12:52.533 --> 12:54.227
Glad you guys
could make it.

12:54.229 --> 12:55.194
Of course.

12:55.196 --> 12:56.698
Wow, it looks really
pretty in here.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.234
Yeah, turns out half a dozen
menorahs really sets a mood.

13:02.307 --> 13:03.568
So, Stuart,
have you thought about

13:03.570 --> 13:05.441
what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?

13:05.443 --> 13:07.576
And there goes the mood.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.639
Hi. Hello.

13:09.641 --> 13:11.573
Oh, and a special
hello to Leonard,

13:11.575 --> 13:15.306
who needs to be
mentioned by name.

13:15.308 --> 13:16.944
Subtle.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.440
But you got it, right?

13:20.081 --> 13:21.246
Hey, guys.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.676
Hey.
Hi. Hello.

13:22.678 --> 13:23.947
I just want
everyone to know,

13:23.949 --> 13:27.084
uh, tonight's not
a sad occasion.

13:27.086 --> 13:28.980
Yeah, we just want to have
the kind of dinner

13:28.982 --> 13:30.651
that we've all had here
so many times before.

13:30.653 --> 13:33.418
Good food, good friends, and
sometime around midnight,

13:33.420 --> 13:36.149
heartburn that makes
you pray for death.

13:37.118 --> 13:39.155
Do you need any help
in the kitchen?

13:39.157 --> 13:41.753
No, we got it. You guys
make yourselves comfortable.

13:43.219 --> 13:46.320
All right, hey, you two, we're
here for Howard right now, okay?

13:46.322 --> 13:48.361
Yes, so please
behave yourselves.

13:48.363 --> 13:50.257
Fine.
Of course.

13:52.961 --> 13:55.860
So I heard you two, uh,
wrote a paper together.

13:55.862 --> 13:57.227
How's that going?

14:01.003 --> 14:03.033
This food is amazing.

14:03.035 --> 14:05.666
Mm, and not
a vegetable in sight.

14:05.668 --> 14:06.906
That's not true.

14:06.908 --> 14:08.505
We've got tomatoes right here.

14:10.876 --> 14:14.282
All these bright people sitting
around a table by candlelight.

14:14.284 --> 14:17.577
Feels like we could be an
18th century French salon.

14:17.579 --> 14:19.017
Indeed.

14:19.019 --> 14:22.123
Penny, a salon is a gathering

14:22.125 --> 14:24.258
where intellectuals
entertained each other

14:24.260 --> 14:26.625
with sparkling conversations
about issues of the day.

14:26.627 --> 14:28.960
Oh, so it's like <i> The View.</i>

14:31.362 --> 14:35.801
Sheldon,<i> The View</i> is a daytime
talk show hosted by women.

14:36.540 --> 14:37.908
Oh, I'm aware.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.508
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

14:39.510 --> 14:42.412
She played Guinan on
<i>Star Trek: Next Gen.</i>

14:42.414 --> 14:44.814
Penny,<i> Next Gen</i>
refers to <i> Star Trek...</i>

14:44.816 --> 14:46.119
Shut up.

14:48.052 --> 14:51.092
I would like to
propose a salon topic.

14:51.094 --> 14:52.524
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

14:52.526 --> 14:54.736
The lead in <i> The Hunger</i>
<i>Games</i> is a woman.

14:54.738 --> 14:57.074
Marvel has made
“Tor” a female.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.843
Wait, who's Tor?

14:58.845 --> 15:03.013
You know, Tor,
the God of “Tunder.”

15:03.783 --> 15:06.685
As I was saying,
is this a sign

15:06.687 --> 15:09.959
that our society is
approaching gender equality?

15:09.961 --> 15:13.463
Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.

15:13.465 --> 15:14.559
It's true.

15:14.561 --> 15:18.631
At the store, I had to put
a seat on the toilet.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.064
We won't know
if there's equality

15:20.066 --> 15:21.903
until female Thor has a baby

15:21.905 --> 15:25.335
and the Avengers are cool with
her pumping breast milk at work.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.173
I wonder if only a baby
who is worthy

15:28.175 --> 15:30.173
can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

15:30.175 --> 15:32.213
PENNY:
Okay, new salon topic.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.045
Salons-- dumb thing
from a long time ago

15:35.047 --> 15:38.285
or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes?

15:38.287 --> 15:39.453
Discuss.

15:40.783 --> 15:43.220
I don't believe it matters
what the topic is.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.451
What's crucial for a salon

15:45.453 --> 15:46.955
is that we conduct
the discussion

15:46.957 --> 15:49.355
in an elevated
and insightful way.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.260
It's all about the execution.

15:51.262 --> 15:54.929
Of course you'd focus on that
rather than the inspiration.

15:54.931 --> 15:56.497
Uh, new salon topic.

15:56.499 --> 15:59.567
What's more important,
an idea or its execution?

15:59.569 --> 16:01.063
Oh, that's fun.

16:01.065 --> 16:02.703
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

16:02.705 --> 16:04.303
That's a lovely little notion.

16:04.305 --> 16:05.503
Kind of like,

16:05.505 --> 16:08.038
“I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago.”

16:08.040 --> 16:11.140
Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.

16:11.142 --> 16:13.139
“Hello? Oh, hold on.”

16:13.141 --> 16:14.339
Leonard, it's your uncle.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.748
He says you just got burned.

16:17.919 --> 16:18.885
Sheldon.

16:18.887 --> 16:20.350
You guys.
No, it's okay.

16:20.352 --> 16:22.717
We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.

16:22.719 --> 16:23.853
At least I am.

16:23.855 --> 16:25.221
Howard, what
do you think?

16:25.223 --> 16:29.958
Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.029
I spend my days

16:31.031 --> 16:32.293
trying to take

16:32.295 --> 16:33.998
ideas and make them real.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.269
Well said, old chap.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.967
I thought eloquence had died;
here it stands before us.

16:38.969 --> 16:40.944
Starting today, it'll go:
Gettysburg Address,

16:40.946 --> 16:43.744
“I have a dream”
and what you just said.

16:43.746 --> 16:45.080
Oh, now he's a genius?

16:45.082 --> 16:47.582
All you ever do is make fun
of him and engineering.

16:47.584 --> 16:50.678
Leonard, please.
His mother just died.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.581
You're being ridiculous.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.716
Yeah, so are you.

16:53.718 --> 16:55.348
Guys, if I wanted to hear
people be bitchy,

16:55.350 --> 16:56.652
I'd go to my real salon.

16:56.654 --> 16:59.452
Leonard, lots of people
could've had that idea,

16:59.454 --> 17:00.725
but very few people could've

17:00.727 --> 17:02.494
worked out the math
the way I did.

17:02.496 --> 17:04.926
Lots of people
also didn't have that idea,

17:04.929 --> 17:07.906
like everyone in the entire
world except for me.

17:07.907 --> 17:09.771
Oh, well,
apparently Leonard thinks

17:09.772 --> 17:11.707
he's better than everyone
in the whole world,

17:11.709 --> 17:12.810
including those

17:12.813 --> 17:14.146
fighting for our freedom.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.612
Yeah, well,
I don't know about you,

17:15.614 --> 17:17.380
but I support our boys overseas.

17:18.519 --> 17:20.423
And girls.

17:20.425 --> 17:23.257
Hey, you already ruined Thor;
give it a rest.

17:24.395 --> 17:25.760
So I'm just supposed to be okay

17:25.762 --> 17:27.830
with you hogging
all the credit?!

17:27.833 --> 17:29.630
I didn't hog anything.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.028
Unlike you and that weird
lasagna with raisins in it.

17:33.030 --> 17:34.268
You want some of this?

17:34.270 --> 17:35.730
I'll give you some.
BERNADETTE: Hey!

17:35.732 --> 17:37.665
Sheldon, Leonard,
living room, right now!

17:43.609 --> 17:47.343
She said my name first;
that must kill you.

17:47.345 --> 17:49.510
BERNADETTE: I don't know
what you think you're doing,

17:49.512 --> 17:51.877
but this is a very difficult
time for my husband!

17:51.879 --> 17:54.677
We're eating the last food
his mother ever made,

17:54.679 --> 17:57.149
and you were gonna throw it
at each other like children?!

17:57.151 --> 17:59.382
Whatever it is you're
fighting about, put it aside,

17:59.384 --> 18:01.591
go back in there
and be a good friend to Howard

18:01.593 --> 18:04.456
or there's no dessert
for either of you!

18:06.499 --> 18:08.962
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

18:08.964 --> 18:10.402
And don't think...

18:10.404 --> 18:14.707
You guys ever notice sometimes
Bernadette sounds like my mom?

18:14.709 --> 18:16.811
I don't hear it.
No, not at all.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.074

18:27.038 --> 18:29.238
(all groaning quietly)

18:33.282 --> 18:36.522
I don't think I've eaten
that much in my entire life.

18:36.524 --> 18:39.787
It's why my people wandered
the desert for 40 years.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.523
Took that long to walk it off.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.256
You see, Penny, the Israelites
were in the desert...

18:46.258 --> 18:48.663
Shut up!

18:48.665 --> 18:51.696
So glad you two
are done fighting.

18:51.698 --> 18:56.303
Right now, I'm just trying
to burp without throwing up.

18:56.305 --> 18:57.367
SHELDON:
Hang on.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.341
<i>Physics Today</i>
mentioned the paper.

19:00.343 --> 19:01.436
What'd they say?

19:01.438 --> 19:03.835
Who cares?
Did they mention Leonard?

19:03.837 --> 19:04.938
They did.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.568
ALL:
Yay.

19:08.073 --> 19:10.011
Good news, I found more Tums.

19:10.035 --> 19:11.793
ALL: Yay!
