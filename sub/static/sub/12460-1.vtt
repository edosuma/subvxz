WEBVTT

02:22.432 --> 02:26.911
That night, penetrating deep into
the heart of Transylvania...

02:26.912 --> 02:30.370
Professor Abronsius was unaware
that he was on the point...

02:30.401 --> 02:34.337
of reaching the goal
of his mysterious investigations.

02:34.338 --> 02:38.172
In the course of which he had journeyed
throughout central Europe...

02:38.178 --> 02:43.810
accompanied by his one and only
faithful disciple, Alfred.

02:44.452 --> 02:48.835
A scholar and scientist
whose genius was unappreciated...

02:48.836 --> 02:52.203
Abronsius had given up all
to devote himself body and soul...

02:52.229 --> 02:55.198
to what was, to him, a sacred mission.

02:55.237 --> 02:58.570
He had even lost his chair
at Kurnigsburg University...

02:58.598 --> 03:03.934
where for a long time his colleagues
used to refer to him as ´´The Nut. ´´

04:27.221 --> 04:28.984
Welcome!

04:30.518 --> 04:32.611
Welcome!

04:34.038 --> 04:35.938
Professor.

04:43.768 --> 04:45.258
Quick, quick!

04:57.851 --> 05:00.285
- Hurry, hurry!
- Here!

05:00.347 --> 05:03.908
- No, no, over here.
- Don`t push me!

05:03.932 --> 05:06.127
Not against the stove,
because of gangrene!

05:06.204 --> 05:08.104
Hot beer!
Hot beer and cinnamon!

05:08.541 --> 05:10.668
Gently.
lt will break like glass.

05:10.749 --> 05:14.207
- A mustard bath for his feet!
- His nose as well. His nose as well.

05:14.238 --> 05:17.401
- No! Not the nose!
- Stand him up! Stand him up!

05:17.439 --> 05:19.430
No!

05:27.392 --> 05:31.294
Rebecca! Where is the bikos
for the gentlemen, no?

05:31.296 --> 05:33.355
lt`s ready, it`s ready!

05:49.796 --> 05:54.724
We drive on a little further
until we get to Bubuski....

05:54.725 --> 05:56.920
Now we get to Fulidnish....

06:12.360 --> 06:14.225
Garlic.

06:16.328 --> 06:19.661
Garlic, my boy. Garlic.

06:20.137 --> 06:22.037
You think....

06:22.122 --> 06:24.181
Without a doubt.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.481
Here.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.858
Here.

06:37.804 --> 06:40.329
ls it finished?

06:40.397 --> 06:44.356
- Yes, it`s finished.
- Wait, wait. We don`t go to Brevarsky?

06:44.365 --> 06:45.923
To Brevarsky.

06:46.029 --> 06:47.894
- No, no, no.
- We don`t go to lski?

06:47.982 --> 06:50.280
No, no, not to lski, no.

06:51.727 --> 06:56.175
The whole winter, if need be.
lndeed, the summer as well.

06:56.176 --> 06:59.304
lt`s a home away from home, no?

06:59.344 --> 07:02.313
- Tell me....
- l`m telling you!

07:02.352 --> 07:06.015
- Listen, you`ve got...
- The garlic.

07:06.033 --> 07:07.432
- Garlic.
- No, no, no.

07:07.537 --> 07:10.700
- What is all the garlic doing here?
- Where?

07:11.634 --> 07:13.261
Here.

07:16.787 --> 07:19.255
Not garlic, professor.
Please, not garlic.

07:19.316 --> 07:22.752
ls there, by any chance,
a castle in the district?

07:22.772 --> 07:26.367
By any chance a castle
in the district?

07:27.125 --> 07:32.392
On the word of Yoyneh, there`s no
more a castle here than a windmill.

07:32.694 --> 07:36.562
Does anybody here know a windmill
in the district?

07:36.566 --> 07:40.332
No? You see? And a castle,
anybody know a castle?

07:40.343 --> 07:43.642
- There`s a castle just over...
- You see?

07:43.672 --> 07:47.506
No castle, no windmill.
Eat, eat, eat.

07:47.512 --> 07:51.915
The bikos is good. You like?
Eat! Look, the little one, he`s eating.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.005
There. You see?

07:59.099 --> 08:04.366
You have the best room in the house.
With its own bathroom. Come.

08:05.339 --> 08:09.691
You`ll be very warm, nice, comfortable.

08:09.692 --> 08:12.957
Please, just take a look.

08:20.318 --> 08:22.616
l`d forgotten Sarah!

08:22.687 --> 08:24.917
l mean, this bath will be free
when this...

08:24.991 --> 08:27.653
l promise, it will be free tomorrow.

08:27.711 --> 08:30.976
Tomorrow, professor.

08:31.296 --> 08:35.096
Use the conveniences in the corridor.
Last door on the left.

08:35.105 --> 08:37.005
Good night, gentlemen.

08:38.466 --> 08:41.902
Dear boy!
All these signs!

08:41.922 --> 08:44.618
All these signs!

08:44.675 --> 08:48.372
We are nearing our goal at last!

08:48.387 --> 08:51.185
We are nearing our goal!

08:53.508 --> 08:56.033
Last door on the left?

08:57.349 --> 08:59.613
We are nearing our goal.

08:59.877 --> 09:01.435
No!

09:04.070 --> 09:07.005
l told you to stay in your room!

09:07.302 --> 09:10.396
- But you always take a bath!
- No!

09:11.751 --> 09:15.744
- l`ll give you that bath!
- l won`t! l won`t, Papa! No!

09:17.192 --> 09:20.355
- l told you, every day you
are having baths! - l won`t!

09:20.393 --> 09:25.353
l told you, no bath!
No bath! No bath! No bath!

09:25.514 --> 09:28.142
Now you satisfied. Now you got it.

09:57.391 --> 10:00.087
lncredible.

10:01.136 --> 10:03.104
Read this.

10:07.473 --> 10:11.953
``According to Elibori...

10:11.954 --> 10:15.287
they cast no reflected image.

10:16.114 --> 10:21.746
Thus, for example, one cannot see them,
nor can they see themselves, in a mirror.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.722
ln a mirror.

10:26.516 --> 10:30.475
Mirror. Nor in any other
object serving the same purpose...

10:30.485 --> 10:34.319
like water, windowpanes, etcetera.``

10:35.286 --> 10:37.117
Water, windowpanes....

10:37.206 --> 10:39.936
What`s next? What`s next?

10:39.991 --> 10:42.619
Someone is walking in the corridor.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.649
Quickly, take them off! Take them off!

11:23.710 --> 11:26.838
Always singing.

11:31.455 --> 11:35.892
What`s my good little fairy up to?
What`s she doing?

11:36.736 --> 11:39.830
Your good little fairy is mending
your nightshirt.

11:40.065 --> 11:45.473
This nightshirt is mine?
No. Yes?

11:45.474 --> 11:48.500
Right, good. lt`s perfect as it is.

11:48.546 --> 11:51.208
l`ll try it on.

11:51.267 --> 11:54.759
lf you try your nightshirt
in my room, l scream.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.451
Yoyneh! Yoyneh!

12:04.869 --> 12:06.530
Hurry, hurry!

12:06.629 --> 12:09.029
Forget about the buttons.

16:32.628 --> 16:36.621
That hunchback, Alfred.
That hunchback. Did you notice?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.494
Revolting.

16:42.614 --> 16:45.742
Why were you under the table?

16:57.688 --> 17:00.213
l think we have a clue!

17:02.137 --> 17:05.435
l want you to follow him.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.953
l am not completely daft, you know.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.762
l`m telling you.

17:37.855 --> 17:42.451
Someone last night
bashed me on the skull.

17:57.571 --> 17:59.937
l don`t see a bump.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.118
l`m not disturbing you, am l?

20:02.168 --> 20:04.796
Not at all. Not at all.

20:05.305 --> 20:09.433
l just don`t know what to do with myself.

20:09.434 --> 20:13.234
l get so bored. You can`t imagine
how bored l get.

20:14.619 --> 20:18.453
Don`t know. l`m just not used to
being locked up the whole time.

20:19.003 --> 20:21.403
You mean you`re always locked up?

20:21.468 --> 20:22.935
At school...

20:23.036 --> 20:26.597
we had fun there.
We used to skip over the wall.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.850
- Did all kinds of things.
- Yeah?

20:28.925 --> 20:31.257
You know what l mean.

20:32.733 --> 20:36.926
Then Papa....
Don`t know what happened to Papa.

20:36.927 --> 20:41.057
My room is full of garlic.

20:41.312 --> 20:43.872
He says it looks pretty.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.695
Pretty.

20:46.112 --> 20:51.296
- l brought it back from school.
- Oh. lt`s a...

20:51.297 --> 20:52.889
good one.

20:52.994 --> 20:55.428
- Soft.
- Soft.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.879
Listen.

20:59.971 --> 21:03.532
l adore it.

21:05.891 --> 21:09.327
l got into the habit of it at school.

21:11.333 --> 21:12.925
He`s funny, Papa.

21:13.029 --> 21:16.760
You just can`t change your habits
in a couple of months, can you?

21:16.774 --> 21:18.605
Besides...

21:18.982 --> 21:21.610
it`s good for your hair.

21:21.670 --> 21:25.003
Once a day is the very least.
Don`t you agree?

21:25.031 --> 21:26.589
Yes.

21:30.696 --> 21:33.893
Do you mind if l have a quick one?

21:37.673 --> 21:39.265
l don`t mind at all, but...

21:39.370 --> 21:42.806
Thank you. You`re being very nice.

21:42.826 --> 21:44.555
Could you get me some hot water?

22:05.902 --> 22:09.531
- Where are you going?
- All right, dear, l`m not going!

22:49.941 --> 22:51.636
Thank you.

24:11.588 --> 24:13.453
What about the umbrella?

24:17.573 --> 24:19.507
Are you crazy?

24:19.749 --> 24:24.652
l saw him! l saw him! He`s there! There!

24:32.712 --> 24:34.304
Sarah!

24:44.330 --> 24:49.130
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency Von Krolock!

24:49.131 --> 24:51.122
Give me back my daughter!

24:51.211 --> 24:53.805
Give her back to me!

24:55.308 --> 24:59.244
Your Excellency!
Little Sarah! Excellency!

24:59.245 --> 25:01.645
- Shagal, Shagal!
- My little girl!

25:01.709 --> 25:05.543
- Shagal.
- l beg you!

26:02.008 --> 26:07.064
Careful. Take care. Careful.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.158
Careful.

26:52.705 --> 26:54.104
What?

26:56.289 --> 26:58.757
Yoyneh!

28:36.178 --> 28:37.645
Look, Alfred.

28:37.747 --> 28:40.807
They have drained him
in the twinkling of an eye.

28:40.852 --> 28:44.413
They are mighty fierce
this winter, the beasts.

28:44.436 --> 28:48.980
- We ought to organize a beat.
- Found one in the forest...

28:48.981 --> 28:51.040
with his throat ripped!

28:51.125 --> 28:54.754
Now they have taken to devouring
each other. Poor Shagal.

28:54.773 --> 28:58.732
- To end in the jaws of a wolf.
- A wolf.

28:58.742 --> 29:02.178
A wolf! You blind wretches!

29:02.199 --> 29:04.531
Open your eyes!

29:04.600 --> 29:07.262
You know perfectly well
who has been at work.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.312
- Ripped.
- Ripped.

29:14.265 --> 29:19.328
You poor victims of your own cowardice!

29:23.226 --> 29:24.955
Stick it where?

29:25.051 --> 29:27.383
Madam Shagal,
l have already explained...

29:27.451 --> 29:31.410
the body of Mr. Shagal is destroyed,
but one can save his soul...

29:31.420 --> 29:33.149
by sticking it in.

29:33.244 --> 29:35.235
- Sticking it in?
- Yes.

29:35.325 --> 29:36.553
- Where?
- ln the heart.

29:36.669 --> 29:39.604
According to the works of Elibori
and my own research...

29:39.645 --> 29:43.206
it is the only way.
Like this, in one go.

29:45.023 --> 29:46.547
- Not.
- Yes!

29:46.654 --> 29:48.713
The works of Elibori.

29:48.799 --> 29:51.165
ln whose heart?

29:57.632 --> 29:59.190
Sticking it in...

29:59.297 --> 30:01.697
in my Yoyneh`s heart?

30:01.761 --> 30:03.592
Stick in my Yoyneh`s heart?

30:03.681 --> 30:04.943
You hear, Yoyneh?

30:05.058 --> 30:09.358
This swine wants me to stick
this shank in your heart!

30:10.787 --> 30:14.086
You stupid old goat!

30:14.115 --> 30:16.106
Stick it?! l`ll stick this...

30:16.196 --> 30:18.494
- ...right through you, you old fool!
- l will!

30:34.567 --> 30:36.728
You one-eyed, blind...!

31:25.231 --> 31:28.723
One, two, three!

32:29.179 --> 32:31.044
- Great.
- He`s gone?

32:35.163 --> 32:37.461
Not bad, this little wine.

33:13.411 --> 33:17.939
Have you got the wrong vampire!

33:22.884 --> 33:25.580
There. ln there.

33:28.869 --> 33:31.099
l thought so.

33:34.534 --> 33:38.595
Madam Jackal... Shagal.
We must all get down to work.

33:38.598 --> 33:43.001
Of course we shall need your assistance.
First we must block up the window.

33:50.857 --> 33:56.201
Good. Good. Next, garlic.
Plenty of garlic everywhere.

33:56.202 --> 34:00.002
And some crucifixes.
l`ll lend you some.

34:00.011 --> 34:03.447
Tomorrow l will see to the transfusion.

34:04.619 --> 34:08.020
ls everything clear?
Well, let me repeat.

34:08.043 --> 34:11.980
The garlic, window blocked, crucifixer...

34:11.981 --> 34:16.440
here, there, there.

34:38.960 --> 34:43.295
Professor, the other way around.
Other way around.

37:50.387 --> 37:53.550
- l can feel something soft.
- Where are you?

37:53.587 --> 37:55.885
Here.

37:55.956 --> 37:57.924
Here.

37:58.004 --> 38:01.496
lt`s a curtain.

38:04.277 --> 38:08.236
There is a door behind it.

38:40.732 --> 38:45.260
l have a funny feeling
we are being watched.

38:46.237 --> 38:50.469
Oh, since you are here, my friend,
perhaps you could tell me...

41:01.492 --> 41:05.940
So this is how one worms
one`s way into my castle.

41:05.941 --> 41:11.811
- Well, to be precise, sir...
- Count Von Krolock.

41:20.855 --> 41:26.088
``Professor Abronsius.
Kurnigsburg University.``

41:27.545 --> 41:30.036
This alters everything.

41:30.105 --> 41:33.302
l have had the opportunity
of reading your work:

41:33.337 --> 41:35.862
The Bat, its Mysteries.

41:35.930 --> 41:39.627
- No, really?
- Remarkable.

41:39.642 --> 41:44.238
l must have a copy somewhere.
l would like you to inscribe it for me.

41:44.239 --> 41:49.243
l... Well, Your Excellency is too kind.

41:49.244 --> 41:54.620
- So you lost your way?
- No. Actually, we were running after...

41:54.621 --> 41:58.113
You were running after...?

41:58.142 --> 42:01.942
A pteropus. Yes, we were
running after a pteropus.

42:01.951 --> 42:04.579
Fancy that.

42:04.639 --> 42:08.405
l thought bats fell into a deep sleep
throughout the winter months.

42:08.416 --> 42:10.213
Not always, Your Excellency.

42:10.303 --> 42:12.897
Nevertheless, that is what
l read in your book.

42:12.960 --> 42:17.679
Precisely, so you can understand the
amazement of my assistant and myself.

42:17.680 --> 42:20.429
We could not believe our eyes.
lsn`t that so, Alfred?

42:20.482 --> 42:24.384
- No, we couldn`t. lt was like...
- Now, imagine, a chiroptera...

42:24.387 --> 42:28.642
flitting about in December? lncredible.

42:28.643 --> 42:33.187
What`s more, it was as big as this.
Wasn`t it, Alfred?

42:33.188 --> 42:37.699
- Like....
- Of course, the case is not unique.

42:37.700 --> 42:40.225
ln my second volume,
actually at the printer`s...

42:40.293 --> 42:44.229
l site several analogous cases
supplied to me by reputable colleagues...

42:44.230 --> 42:48.454
such as Falkman at Munich,
Dr. Athener of Prague.

42:48.455 --> 42:52.710
- Curious.
- Curious, yes, but in no way inexplicable.

42:52.711 --> 42:56.169
l think we can look for the cause
in the purely mechanical need...

42:56.200 --> 42:59.363
to fight against the torpor
of hibernation...

42:59.401 --> 43:04.040
to restore circulation
by primary motion...

43:04.041 --> 43:09.274
to cause the vital limbs
to work without thinking.

43:10.250 --> 43:15.050
This, in consequence,
makes them fly...

43:15.051 --> 43:18.748
without being aware of it.

43:18.764 --> 43:21.494
Of course, l only refer
to the very rare species...

43:21.549 --> 43:24.643
not conforming
to the laws of hibernation.

43:29.101 --> 43:31.194
Rather like sleepwalkers?

43:31.374 --> 43:33.035
Yes.

43:33.134 --> 43:37.093
Let us say, they fly in their sleep.

43:37.103 --> 43:40.129
l had an aunt who was a sleepwalker.

43:40.176 --> 43:43.111
At night she frequently
ran about on the battlements...

43:43.152 --> 43:47.111
without causing me any surprise,
because there was actual contact.

43:47.121 --> 43:48.850
But the walking isn`t flying.

43:48.946 --> 43:51.744
How is it possible to avoid
an obstacle when flying...

43:51.793 --> 43:55.160
while being simultaneously asleep?

43:55.186 --> 44:00.123
Your Excellency is a very great authority.

44:02.547 --> 44:06.745
The natural sciences
greatly interested me...

44:08.052 --> 44:10.885
when l was a young man.

44:13.046 --> 44:15.514
My library.

44:28.664 --> 44:31.531
lt`s at your disposal.

44:34.041 --> 44:39.673
To fly in one`s sleep, you say.
How is it possible?

44:44.123 --> 44:46.489
The rays.

44:48.699 --> 44:52.260
- Rays?
- The rays.

44:59.038 --> 45:03.934
Gentlemen, Koukol informs me
that your beds are prepared.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.529
Your Excellency,
we have kept you up very late.

45:06.591 --> 45:12.029
l`m a night bird.
l am not much good in the daytime.

45:18.593 --> 45:23.937
Their little heads contain
a fantastic mechanism, sort of....

45:23.938 --> 45:27.704
Anyway, this mechanism emits the rays,
the nature of which escapes me...

45:27.714 --> 45:30.774
but one thing is absolutely certain,
that these rays...

45:30.819 --> 45:35.438
come into contact with every obstacle
in the way and rebound off that obstacle...

45:35.439 --> 45:37.827
back into their little heads
and warn them.

45:37.892 --> 45:40.690
That would explain why they
can fly in utter darkness.

45:40.740 --> 45:42.833
Exactly!

45:45.541 --> 45:47.509
Herbert, my son.

45:47.590 --> 45:51.219
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

45:58.056 --> 46:00.183
Good evening.

46:22.348 --> 46:27.435
Here is your room.
And this one is for you.

46:27.436 --> 46:31.429
- What?
- The rooms...

46:31.437 --> 46:33.962
communicate.

46:51.313 --> 46:54.339
Good night, gentlemen.

47:17.557 --> 47:19.889
The fellow is no fool, you know.

47:19.958 --> 47:24.895
Did you hear how he held his own
on the subject of the bats?

47:28.920 --> 47:32.913
Really sound arguments.

47:34.169 --> 47:37.536
Not like those morons from Kurnigsburg.

47:37.561 --> 47:40.962
- You see, my boy?
- Yeah.

47:40.986 --> 47:43.181
Professor?

47:44.058 --> 47:45.719
Aren`t we going to barricade?

47:45.818 --> 47:49.219
No, l don`t think that
will be very good tactics.

47:49.243 --> 47:51.211
l thought we were going to barricade.

47:51.291 --> 47:54.089
No, the best thing is to sleep
with one eye open...

47:54.140 --> 47:57.166
or to take the watch in turns.

47:59.965 --> 48:02.365
What is it? What is it?

48:04.542 --> 48:07.170
What are you doing?

48:07.231 --> 48:08.721
l`m going to bed.

48:08.831 --> 48:12.323
What has come over you?
Go to your own bed.

48:13.823 --> 48:16.917
- Alone?
- Go.

48:21.248 --> 48:23.546
We can keep the door open.

48:23.617 --> 48:26.381
At the slightest alarm...

48:26.434 --> 48:28.766
we call out.

52:13.481 --> 52:17.769
Mr. Koukol, l`m not disturbing a soul here.

52:17.770 --> 52:22.036
There`s plenty of room.
People can pass over here.

52:24.875 --> 52:28.902
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

52:28.907 --> 52:32.570
Mr. Koukol, please.

52:33.356 --> 52:36.689
Mr. Koukol, what are you
doing to me, please?

52:36.717 --> 52:38.708
l beg of you...

52:38.798 --> 52:40.766
Look, l...

52:45.423 --> 52:48.756
Please, it`s not comfortable here.

52:48.783 --> 52:51.149
lt`s dirty here. Look, the day`s coming.

52:51.216 --> 52:56.051
There`s too much light
here for me. Mr. Koukol....

53:00.113 --> 53:03.571
So now you are satisfied?

53:10.355 --> 53:12.755
What can you do with such people?

53:12.819 --> 53:15.379
Hunchback swine.

53:15.444 --> 53:18.413
What does it cost?
Does it cost him anything?

53:18.452 --> 53:22.218
He should leave me in there.
Why does he bring me here?

53:36.312 --> 53:38.780
Sarah.

53:59.036 --> 54:00.731
Sarah.

54:39.971 --> 54:41.461
He`s got a nerve.

54:41.571 --> 54:44.836
- A nerve?
- Von Krolock, he`s brazen.

54:44.868 --> 54:47.166
You remember last night?

54:47.236 --> 54:52.516
``l am a night bird.
l am not much good in the daytime.``

54:52.517 --> 54:55.975
- That`s what he said.
- Yeah? So what?

54:56.006 --> 55:00.293
lt`s obvious.
During the daytime he rests, he reposes.

55:00.294 --> 55:03.923
- Reposes?
- ln the crypt with his fellows.

55:05.639 --> 55:08.073
Maybe there is no crypt in this castle.

55:08.136 --> 55:14.055
Don`t be foolish. A castle without
a crypt is like a unicorn without a horn.

55:14.056 --> 55:18.390
You`re not going to start arguing with me
like my colleagues from Kurnigsburg?

55:20.810 --> 55:23.608
Oh, first-rate, this bed.

55:23.658 --> 55:26.456
Did you sleep well?

55:28.459 --> 55:30.393
l heard singing.

55:30.476 --> 55:32.944
Well, that`s no reason
to look so worried.

55:33.003 --> 55:35.938
l`m sure it was Sarah. Sarah, yes.

55:35.981 --> 55:39.610
- And who is Sarah?
- Sarah, Shagal`s daughter.

55:39.629 --> 55:42.359
Oh, yes, of course.

55:44.014 --> 55:47.541
l must confess l rather enjoy luxury.

55:47.566 --> 55:50.899
All these years running uphill...

55:50.927 --> 55:55.631
and down dale,
debating with morons.

55:55.632 --> 55:58.965
Trying to convince a pack of fools.

55:58.992 --> 56:02.894
Oh, and the expense,
perpetual expense.

56:02.897 --> 56:04.125
l`m sure it was Sarah.

56:04.241 --> 56:07.836
Do you know what that robber Shagal
charges us for board and lodging?

56:07.858 --> 56:10.383
- Her father?
- Four dollars, my boy.

56:10.450 --> 56:14.045
Yes, by Jupiter. Four a day.

56:14.067 --> 56:18.731
Bed without breakfast. The ruffian.

56:20.149 --> 56:22.310
- Do you feel in good shape, at least?
- Yes.

56:22.388 --> 56:24.686
- We`ve got a lot on our plate.
- To find Sarah?

56:24.757 --> 56:26.884
Now, keep calm. The crypt comes first.

56:26.966 --> 56:32.768
- But what about Sarah?
- We mustn`t put the cart before the horse.

57:16.318 --> 57:18.912
- What`s he up to?
- He`s woodworking.

57:18.975 --> 57:22.240
But it`s a coffin.

57:24.863 --> 57:26.854
- Footprints.
- She`s dead.

57:26.944 --> 57:30.710
- Eureka!
- Dead. Dead.

57:30.720 --> 57:33.280
Who is dead?

57:33.345 --> 57:36.212
- Sarah.
- When?

57:38.210 --> 57:41.668
- What ``when``?
- Sarah`s death.

57:41.699 --> 57:43.257
Oh, my God.

57:43.363 --> 57:46.560
- Where is she?
- l don`t know.

57:46.595 --> 57:51.381
What are you driveling about? How can you
tell me she`s dead when you don`t know?

57:51.382 --> 57:55.494
- The coffin, it`s for her.
- No, no, no, no. They are still working on it.

57:55.495 --> 58:00.047
lf she were dead, she would already be in it
like one of them, screened from the light.

58:00.048 --> 58:02.700
- She`s not dead?
- Work it out for yourself.

58:02.758 --> 58:05.818
You may be sure they`ll make her
last as long as they can.

58:05.863 --> 58:07.353
lt`s their idea of fun.

58:07.463 --> 58:10.398
ln that case, who is the coffin for?

58:10.439 --> 58:13.602
Oh, for her or....

58:30.155 --> 58:33.318
Don`t look at him. Behave naturally.

58:33.356 --> 58:37.156
Recite for me the 1 2 signs of the Zodiac.

58:37.548 --> 58:39.914
Leo, Virgo...

58:39.981 --> 58:43.747
Gemini, Cancer, White Boar.

58:43.757 --> 58:47.056
What are you talking about?

58:49.646 --> 58:51.614
No panic.

58:51.695 --> 58:55.563
This lout guards the crypt like a Cerberus.

58:55.567 --> 58:58.695
We must think of a stratagem.

58:58.735 --> 59:05.197
Just whistle as if nothing has happened
and let`s turn back.

59:08.497 --> 59:11.694
Not so fast.

01:02:27.604 --> 01:02:29.799
l`m stuck.

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:32.572
You`ll have to help me, my boy.

01:02:48.984 --> 01:02:51.646
lmbecile!

01:02:57.561 --> 01:03:00.325
l can`t get a grip.

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:04.387
You will have to operate on your own.

01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:06.379
- Operate on my own?
- Yes.

01:03:06.459 --> 01:03:08.620
What has to be done?

01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:11.099
The stakes, my boy.

01:03:11.164 --> 01:03:13.428
The stakes?

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.025
- These stakes?
- What other stakes could there be?

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:18.561
They must be driven in.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.322
- By me?
- They`re not going to drive in on their own!

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:26.598
- Not that, master. Please, not that.
- Come on, my boy, show some guts!

01:03:26.599 --> 01:03:28.388
l`m here.

01:03:28.479 --> 01:03:31.414
First you must remove the lids.

01:03:31.456 --> 01:03:34.653
Oh, Mama. Remove the lids?

01:03:34.688 --> 01:03:36.246
lt`s an order.

01:03:50.211 --> 01:03:51.803
Go on.

01:03:51.907 --> 01:03:55.104
Open it, for heaven`s sake!

01:04:03.397 --> 01:04:05.388
l can`t, master.

01:04:05.478 --> 01:04:10.074
For the sake of Shagal`s daughter, open it!

01:04:27.017 --> 01:04:29.577
Open your eyes.

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:33.439
Open your eyes!

01:04:33.546 --> 01:04:35.173
Who is it?

01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.406
- His Excellency.
- Good.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.975
Now, the other one.

01:04:59.567 --> 01:05:02.434
And this one?

01:05:05.263 --> 01:05:07.663
His Excellency`s son.

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:10.821
And....

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.504
And what?

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:19.413
- And what?
- Shagal!

01:05:21.683 --> 01:05:23.708
He`s there?

01:05:24.564 --> 01:05:27.499
Very well. Open the case.

01:05:30.421 --> 01:05:32.582
Pick up a stake...

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.679
and a hammer.

01:05:36.342 --> 01:05:37.673
Now...

01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:40.306
go do the count.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:46.104
Search for the right spot, in between the
seventh and eighth on the left. Don`t forget.

01:05:49.431 --> 01:05:52.798
Place the stake over the spot.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.678
Not upside-down!

01:05:56.889 --> 01:05:58.413
That`s it!

01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:00.934
Raise the hammer...

01:06:01.242 --> 01:06:02.834
and...

01:06:02.938 --> 01:06:05.270
strike!

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.057
Strike!

01:06:08.155 --> 01:06:10.214
Oh, mutiny, is it?

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.962
l will take an oath if there is mutiny.

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:17.019
Come on, my baby. Hit.

01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:21.390
There`s a good little scout.

01:06:23.037 --> 01:06:27.167
Are you going to hit it or not,
you good for nothing...

01:06:39.616 --> 01:06:41.345
All right.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.707
Everything back in the case.

01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:47.018
lt`s no use.

01:06:47.361 --> 01:06:52.958
You will have to pull me out.
From the other side, dumbbell!

01:06:53.827 --> 01:06:56.853
Mind he doesn`t catch you.

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:22.011
- Sarah!
- lt`s you!

01:08:31.828 --> 01:08:33.796
Sarah....

01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:45.188
l`m going to save you.
We`ll go away together.

01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:47.640
Where do you want us to go?

01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:51.298
l don`t know.
To your parents`, perhaps.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:54.880
They said Papa will be coming
to see me soon.

01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:57.381
They said that?

01:08:57.496 --> 01:09:01.158
Yes. You... You`ve seen my dress?

01:09:01.176 --> 01:09:02.939
Beautiful, isn`t it?

01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:04.591
Very beautiful.

01:09:04.698 --> 01:09:07.792
They gave it to me for the ball tonight.

01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:09.524
Ball?

01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:11.670
The midnight ball.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.934
This evening, here? A ball?

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:16.768
At midnight?

01:09:16.956 --> 01:09:18.514
They`ll all be there.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.180
But we can still have a dance together,
you know?

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:24.372
Sarah, you must follow me.

01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:25.710
Follow you?

01:09:25.822 --> 01:09:28.051
l beseech you.

01:09:29.438 --> 01:09:32.703
Well, tomorrow, perhaps.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.932
But tomorrow will be too late.

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.935
Turn around.

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.500
Sarah?

01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:12.049
May l turn around?

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:59.031
My head is swimming around.

01:12:03.192 --> 01:12:07.390
l`m no longer the age
for this sort of activity.

01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:14.594
Look! How wonderful nature is.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.961
Yes. Wonderful.

01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:21.681
The sun is setting.
Glorious! Magnificent!

01:12:22.493 --> 01:12:25.724
The sun is setting
and they are going to rise.

01:12:25.757 --> 01:12:28.317
lt`s in the order of things.

01:12:44.384 --> 01:12:46.944
Oh, what a pity not to have the time.

01:12:47.008 --> 01:12:51.168
Once l get stuck into it,
l am engulfed for a week!

01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:52.761
This way, master.

01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:54.389
Wait.

01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:22.792
Pretty well-equipped.

01:13:28.647 --> 01:13:30.547
Professor....

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:34.476
Here is Orion!

01:13:35.593 --> 01:13:38.960
And here is Saturn, with its ring!

01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:43.452
Come. Come and have a look, my boy.
There it is.

01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:10.449
Courage, my good woman, courage.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.481
Bless my soul.

01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:27.703
Shiver my timbers!

01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:31.656
Unless they barricade thoroughly....

01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:34.725
l know what l am talking about...

01:15:02.808 --> 01:15:04.435
Sarah?

01:15:11.033 --> 01:15:13.001
Are you ill?

01:15:15.258 --> 01:15:17.055
How pale he is!

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.807
l`m not pale.

01:15:18.907 --> 01:15:22.468
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
l assure you.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.983
You are as white as a sheet.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.528
- No!
- Yes, Alfred.

01:15:31.165 --> 01:15:33.360
You must have a rest.

01:15:43.935 --> 01:15:47.666
Have a little rest and you`ll feel
much, much better.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.841
l don`t like to see you in this state.

01:15:53.857 --> 01:15:57.224
There, now. Feeling better?

01:15:57.250 --> 01:16:00.151
lsn`t there a ball tonight?

01:16:01.442 --> 01:16:03.842
How long they are.

01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:07.832
They look like golden threads.

01:16:09.028 --> 01:16:10.893
Your lashes.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.167
My lashes?

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.297
Golden....

01:16:23.878 --> 01:16:27.575
Who told you there`s going
to be a ball tonight?

01:16:27.879 --> 01:16:30.473
Nobody. l`m just guessing.

01:16:30.535 --> 01:16:33.163
With a great castle like this,
it`s possible.

01:16:33.224 --> 01:16:35.454
He`s just guessing. But it`s true.

01:16:35.528 --> 01:16:37.962
You`ve guessed correctly
with your pretty head.

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:44.453
Yes, Alfred, there`s going to be a ball,
and you will be able to dance.

01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:54.188
What is it you`re clutching there
like a little treasure?

01:16:54.283 --> 01:16:56.683
Here. Show me.

01:16:56.747 --> 01:16:59.079
Alfred, show me.

01:17:05.805 --> 01:17:08.399
So that`s the big secret.

01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:10.794
Somebody is in love.

01:17:11.118 --> 01:17:15.452
Somebody`s little heart is beating
around in their bosom.

01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:20.238
Pitter-pat, pitter-pat, pitter-pat,
like a rat in a cage.

01:17:21.553 --> 01:17:23.748
``Seventieth way:

01:17:23.985 --> 01:17:27.921
Place the left arm around
the shoulders of the loved one.

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:31.570
Put the left hand on her left shoulder...

01:17:31.634 --> 01:17:35.695
like a little birdie alighting
on a branch.``

01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:38.224
Good. Excellent.

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:41.653
``Then let an angel pass.``

01:17:41.844 --> 01:17:44.938
Shall we allow an angel to pass?

01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:48.960
``Once the angel has passed...

01:17:49.045 --> 01:17:52.242
bend the face towards the locks
of the loved one...

01:17:52.278 --> 01:17:55.839
and brush them with the lips.``

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:21.022
Close the door!

01:19:21.126 --> 01:19:23.526
- Playing games?
- Close the door!

01:20:05.741 --> 01:20:10.201
He went berserk.
Did you provoke him or what?

01:20:10.253 --> 01:20:11.880
No.

01:20:11.982 --> 01:20:15.042
- He got excited all on his own.
- On his own. On his own.

01:20:15.502 --> 01:20:17.800
- Oh, l meant to tell you...
- What?

01:20:17.871 --> 01:20:21.170
- Elibori`s theory is correct.
- Which one?

01:20:21.327 --> 01:20:23.352
The one to do with the reflections.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.841
- ln the mirror. l was...
- Explain yourself more clearly.

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:32.305
l was in front of a mirror,
sitting on the edge of a bed and....

01:20:32.306 --> 01:20:34.274
And, well, l was alone...

01:20:34.353 --> 01:20:37.379
yet he was by my side,
but nothing from him.

01:20:37.427 --> 01:20:40.954
No reflection. Nothing. Blank.

01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:44.471
- Not even his clothes?
- Not even his shirt.

01:20:45.076 --> 01:20:47.374
l`d love to have seen that.

01:20:47.444 --> 01:20:50.004
One doesn`t see a thing.

01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:52.961
You found something to eat?

01:20:53.046 --> 01:20:54.741
l? No.

01:20:54.837 --> 01:20:58.466
There is a smell of garlic sausage.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.372
Good gracious!

01:21:54.016 --> 01:21:55.244
l`m frightened.

01:21:55.552 --> 01:21:57.986
lt`s quite impressive.

01:21:58.048 --> 01:22:00.710
- You think they are all...?
- Undoubtedly!

01:22:00.769 --> 01:22:04.034
- Oh, my God.
- You should never have come here.

01:22:04.065 --> 01:22:07.523
- So why did we come?
- Ask the professor.

01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:10.700
Oh, so you`re here. You`re here.

01:22:10.787 --> 01:22:14.917
lf you have no objection,
l`m not hibernating.

01:22:15.683 --> 01:22:18.277
- You don`t seem very pleased.
- l am surprised.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:21.673
Keep your surprise for later on,
you`ll need it.

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:31.237
You didn`t foresee this in your
second volume, still at the printer`s.

01:22:31.431 --> 01:22:34.559
lt will be my pleasure to fill in
the gaps in your learning.

01:22:34.695 --> 01:22:37.823
When you attain my spiritual level...

01:22:37.863 --> 01:22:41.959
we shall then have the long winter
evenings before us for our discussions.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.054
The long evenings...

01:22:45.096 --> 01:22:48.395
of many winters.

01:22:49.993 --> 01:22:53.485
Your young assistant will make
an excellent companion for my son.

01:22:53.675 --> 01:22:55.666
He`s already quite fond of him.

01:22:55.754 --> 01:22:58.655
He`s told me so. He`s a gentle...

01:22:58.699 --> 01:23:01.133
sensitive youth.

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:05.608
ln the course of the centuries,
they`ll learn to know each other better...

01:23:05.612 --> 01:23:07.705
just as we shall.

01:23:09.773 --> 01:23:13.869
As brooks flow into streams,
streams into rivers...

01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:15.531
and rivers into the sea...

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:20.526
so our adepts flow back to us
and swell our ranks.

01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:23.325
Soon we shall be
victorious and triumphant!

01:23:23.376 --> 01:23:25.606
We shall then hold sway over this Earth...

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.480
which awaits our coming
as autumn awaits winter.

01:23:34.865 --> 01:23:38.392
Look at him, almost an old man...

01:23:38.418 --> 01:23:40.818
with his flabby stomach
and spindly legs...

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:43.476
bring, with dog-like devotion,
a fresh adept...

01:23:43.539 --> 01:23:46.736
who only a few nights ago
was under his protection.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:50.867
Look well at this man who secreted
another girl more closely...

01:23:50.868 --> 01:23:53.336
- ...than a miser hoarding his gold.
- Sarah!

01:23:53.397 --> 01:23:58.630
But tonight he`s happy.
See how he frisks and capers.

01:24:07.895 --> 01:24:09.920
l must leave you now.

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:12.476
See you later, gentlemen.

01:24:12.728 --> 01:24:16.596
Meditate while awaiting your turn...

01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:20.230
for it would be extremely difficult
for you to get away from here.

01:24:20.249 --> 01:24:23.150
Unless, of course, you have wings.

01:24:24.762 --> 01:24:26.423
Like a bat.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:15.638
He displeased me as much this evening
as he impressed me the first time.

01:25:24.805 --> 01:25:26.670
What they deserve is...

01:25:26.757 --> 01:25:29.487
a good cannonball right in the...

01:25:45.352 --> 01:25:48.287
Quick, help me turn it around!

01:25:58.123 --> 01:25:59.852
A little more.

01:26:02.443 --> 01:26:03.910
More.

01:26:13.485 --> 01:26:16.818
Would you mind giving me a hand? Good.

01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:21.249
Put the wood under the cannon!

01:26:28.911 --> 01:26:31.402
Under the cannon, under the cannon.

01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:18.576
Takes me for a nincompoop.
That necrophile.

01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:48.404
A year ago....

01:27:49.726 --> 01:27:55.130
A year ago, exactly on this same night,
we were assembled here in this very room.

01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:59.097
l, your pastor, and you,
my beloved flock.

01:27:59.136 --> 01:28:02.128
With hopefulness in my heart,
l told you then...

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:08.206
that with Lucifer`s aid we might look
forward to a more succulent occasion.

01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:10.871
Cast back your minds.

01:28:10.945 --> 01:28:15.074
There we were, gathered together,
gloomy and despondent...

01:28:15.075 --> 01:28:20.035
around that single meager woodcutter.

01:28:21.444 --> 01:28:23.776
A year has elapsed...

01:28:23.844 --> 01:28:27.712
and although travelers turn up
more and more seldom in these parts...

01:28:27.716 --> 01:28:31.618
in spite of this,
l have this evening a great...

01:28:31.621 --> 01:28:35.455
a wonderful surprise for you!

01:28:35.654 --> 01:28:38.851
Dearly beloved brethren...

01:28:38.886 --> 01:28:41.252
come closer.

01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:50.728
This isn`t all.

01:28:50.824 --> 01:28:52.758
This isn`t all!

01:28:52.841 --> 01:28:58.025
Yet another human
is at this very moment being groomed.

01:28:58.026 --> 01:28:59.254
And!

01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:01.702
And! And!

01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:07.141
Two more humans are in our hands!

01:29:49.907 --> 01:29:52.000
Go on, go on. Have your bath now.

01:29:52.083 --> 01:29:53.516
Then turn your back to me.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.885
All those ladies and gentlemen
are awaiting you. Listen!

01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:59.111
Listen to the music.

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:01.802
Come on, take it off!

01:30:01.909 --> 01:30:05.242
- Don´t you look.
- I´m not looking, I´m not looking.

01:30:05.526 --> 01:30:09.724
- Will I be seeing His Excellency?
- Yes, you´ll see His Excellency.

01:30:09.725 --> 01:30:11.879
It´s for me, this lovely dress?

01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:15.952
Yeah, for you, this lovely dress.
And so are the shoes.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.520
I wonder what His Excellency´s like.

01:30:18.584 --> 01:30:22.042
Look here, what are you doing? Oh, no!

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.694
Now, listen, I´m old enough to be your...
I´m still your boss, my girl.

01:30:26.777 --> 01:30:29.837
If you do that again,
I´m telling His Excellency.

01:30:29.882 --> 01:30:32.851
- Forget your precious Excellency a minute.
- Shagal!

01:30:35.515 --> 01:30:37.608
What? Who spoke?

01:30:37.691 --> 01:30:40.159
I did!

01:30:43.549 --> 01:30:45.517
Who is speaking, who?

01:30:45.597 --> 01:30:49.363
How dare you ask questions, you letch!

01:30:49.373 --> 01:30:51.841
Please! Forgive me!

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:55.677
l didn`t mean to ask questions.
You understand. Thank you.

01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.678
Have you unhitched the horse?

01:30:57.758 --> 01:31:01.125
Horse? Oy. l`ll go. l`ll go at once!

01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:04.382
l`ll need it harnessed, you idiot!

01:31:05.216 --> 01:31:08.652
- Oh, and Shagal, about that girl....
- Yeah?

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:12.768
- Don´t you touch her again!
- l`m not touching! Who`s touching?

01:31:50.216 --> 01:31:52.946
You`re pulling my leg.

01:31:56.424 --> 01:31:59.450
You wouldn`t do a thing
like that to Yoyneh.

01:31:59.913 --> 01:32:02.882
Hey. Answer me.

01:32:31.727 --> 01:32:35.925
lf they had listened to me,
all this would never have happened.

01:32:36.272 --> 01:32:37.967
Can`t we do anything for her?

01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:39.692
She`s one of them already.

01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:41.851
And Sarah?

01:32:41.937 --> 01:32:44.132
Quick, professor, quick!

01:32:47.858 --> 01:32:49.120
The case.

01:32:49.426 --> 01:32:52.054
That damned case.

01:32:52.243 --> 01:32:55.269
Why did you have to lose it?

01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:02.431
lt is l.

01:34:03.839 --> 01:34:06.137
Life has a meaning once more.

01:34:06.784 --> 01:34:08.843
We are going to save you.

01:34:19.522 --> 01:34:21.581
You spoke to her?

01:34:30.948 --> 01:34:33.178
l had a word with her.

01:34:40.102 --> 01:34:42.434
After a good transfusion...

01:34:45.799 --> 01:34:50.031
and a few days` rest,
you will be as right as rain, my child.

01:35:04.777 --> 01:35:07.871
We`ve got a congress in Venice.

01:35:07.914 --> 01:35:12.618
The palaces, the sky.
Venice, Sarah, Venice.

01:35:12.619 --> 01:35:17.989
The gondolas. The sun. The sea.

01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:22.601
At the next turn, we make for the door.

01:35:29.742 --> 01:35:33.303
- Light. Life. Love.
- When l say ``hop, `` we make for the door...

01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:35.851
- ...and run for it.
- Our love.

01:36:19.863 --> 01:36:23.458
Snatch the girl from them!

01:36:49.052 --> 01:36:50.542
Sharpen your teeth!

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.174
The bats!

01:37:34.692 --> 01:37:37.855
l`ve never come across
such remarkable specimens.

01:37:37.989 --> 01:37:41.550
- We haven`t got the time!
- l would have to examine them in detail...

01:37:41.574 --> 01:37:45.772
but here and now l can assert
we are dealing with Pteropus Poliocephalus.

01:37:45.773 --> 01:37:48.360
We haven`t got the time.

01:38:24.396 --> 01:38:30.062
Go. One, two, three, four. Good.

01:39:39.481 --> 01:39:43.076
Go! Go, Koukol, go!

01:39:43.099 --> 01:39:46.125
Give them a little hell, fire and blood!

01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:50.540
Go! Catch them!

01:41:12.746 --> 01:41:15.044
Go on, sleep.

01:41:18.475 --> 01:41:20.409
Your....

01:41:20.492 --> 01:41:25.896
Your tiny hand. lt`s frozen.

01:41:28.205 --> 01:41:30.173
Professor, she`s....

01:41:31.469 --> 01:41:33.630
Tiny hand is....

01:41:40.431 --> 01:41:42.661
l thought that....

01:41:44.688 --> 01:41:50.524
My little hand, my pretty hand.
Soon l will be sleeping...

01:42:03.667 --> 01:42:09.107
That night, fleeing from Transylvania,
Professor Abronsius never guessed...

01:42:09.108 --> 01:42:14.004
he was carrying away with him
the very evil he had wished to destroy.

01:42:14.005 --> 01:42:20.308
Thanks to him, this evil would at last
be able to spread across the world.
