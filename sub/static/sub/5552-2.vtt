00:02.212 --> 00:03.213
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.713 --> 00:06.466
My best wishes to Commissioner Essen.

00:07.092 --> 00:08.301
Welcome back, Jim.

00:08.468 --> 00:12.514
<i>I don't know how you pulled
this off, but I'm glad you did.</i>

00:13.973 --> 00:16.434
<i>Sometimes the right way is
also the ugly way.</i>

00:17.352 --> 00:19.145
<i>There's been an incident
at Arkham Asylum.</i>

00:19.354 --> 00:20.855
<i>Six inmates have escaped.</i>

00:21.064 --> 00:22.774
Barbara Kean was one of them.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.234
Oh, my God.

00:25.026 --> 00:28.113
The world sees criminal lunatics.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.115
<i>I see brilliance.</i>

00:31.449 --> 00:33.702
Gotham would tremble before you.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.624
<i>"I beg of you, my son,
please choose happiness,</i>

00:40.625 --> 00:41.960
<i>"unless you feel a calling.</i>

00:42.794 --> 00:44.337
"A true calling."

00:46.923 --> 00:48.174
<i>Mr. Mayor.</i>

00:48.425 --> 00:50.301
- <i>No!</i>
- You want to know what I really am?

00:51.302 --> 00:53.304
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Shall I tell you?

00:53.596 --> 00:55.306
<i>Please, please</i>.

00:56.683 --> 00:58.143
At heart,

00:58.852 --> 01:02.021
- I'm an ardent student of human nature.
- Oh.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.566
<i>Fascinating paradox, we are.</i>

01:05.650 --> 01:08.611
So wise, and yet so foolish.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.739
So brave, and yet so fearful.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.658
For instance, this is a glass jar.

01:13.825 --> 01:17.287
Inside it is a hairy spider.
A tarantula, I guess, but I'm no expert.

01:18.663 --> 01:21.666
In a minute, I'm going to open that little
hatch in the front of your box,

01:21.916 --> 01:25.670
I'm going to drop the spider inside
and I'm going to close it.

01:26.004 --> 01:28.339
- No, no!
- That's choice A.

01:29.549 --> 01:32.594
Choice B, I open the hatch,

01:32.927 --> 01:36.014
<i>you speak to your lovely secretary
Maggie on the telephone,</i>

01:36.347 --> 01:38.391
you tell her you've run away
with some woman,

01:38.600 --> 01:42.103
you'll be sending
written instructions shortly.

01:42.395 --> 01:45.231
So which is it, choice A or choice B?

01:45.523 --> 01:47.525
Choice B, please.
Please, choice B.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.069
The telephone. Of course.

01:51.613 --> 01:53.031
It's human nature.

01:55.867 --> 01:58.953
See? There is no spider.

02:01.539 --> 02:06.294
But if you don't do what I ask,
you'll wish there was one.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.630
Why are you doing this to me?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.757
Don't fret so.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.551
You're part of a great endeavor,

02:14.385 --> 02:15.637
a great cleansing.

02:17.514 --> 02:20.642
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

02:21.100 --> 02:25.688
Monsters who will cleanse this city

02:26.564 --> 02:30.193
in blood and fire.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.906
Can you confirm that?
Yeah? Okay.

02:35.073 --> 02:36.241
Because we're going to roll with that
right away.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.076
You've got to confirm it though.
Do you understand?

02:38.243 --> 02:39.828
Otherwise, you can get in
a lot of trouble.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.499
What the hell is this?

02:44.749 --> 02:47.836
"Where is Mayor James?
Who is his mystery lover?"

02:48.086 --> 02:50.129
No one cares who the mayor is banging.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.257
You can do better than this, people.

02:52.465 --> 02:54.926
Now go out and get me
some headlines, damn it!

03:00.056 --> 03:01.766
Yeah. All right, all right.

03:03.101 --> 03:04.269
Oh, my goodness!

03:04.769 --> 03:06.104
Oh, my God!

03:08.940 --> 03:10.316
Perfect.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.110
Next.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.529
Mister X.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.705
A little to the right.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.541
Okay, that's the spot.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.298
Perfect.

03:34.465 --> 03:37.552
What shall we do with the spare?

03:41.764 --> 03:42.765
Oh.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.519
I know.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.319
Aaron, would you kindly?

04:17.425 --> 04:18.801
Now, that's a headline.

04:26.559 --> 04:28.186
You all know what we're facing here.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.397
Forty-eight hours ago,
six criminally-insane inmates

04:31.648 --> 04:33.441
were busted out of Arkham Asylum.

04:33.733 --> 04:37.236
Yesterday, four of those inmates
broke into Yellen Shipyard,

04:37.612 --> 04:40.114
kidnapped seven workers,
then dropped them off

04:40.323 --> 04:41.699
the roof of the <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

04:41.866 --> 04:43.701
As of now, we still have no leads

04:43.910 --> 04:46.454
on the person or persons
behind the breakout.

04:46.663 --> 04:48.539
Jim Gordon's lead. Jim.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.208
These are our targets.

04:53.503 --> 04:57.423
Jerome Valeska, 18 years old. Matricide.

04:58.967 --> 05:04.263
Arnold Dobkins, schizophrenic.
Poisoner, rapist.

05:06.015 --> 05:10.228
Aaron Helzinger. Killed his entire family
with his bare hands.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.441
Robert Greenwood.
Killed and then ate a dozen women.

05:20.238 --> 05:23.366
Barbara Kean. Killed her parents.

05:26.411 --> 05:27.954
We're going to work this
in groups of four.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.665
I'll hand out assignments
throughout the day.

05:31.124 --> 05:34.043
Alvarez is my coordinating officer.
Any questions?

05:35.753 --> 05:36.879
Let's get to work.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.514
Fine job yesterday, gentlemen.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.934
We opened big.
The whole city knows your name now.

05:50.435 --> 05:53.021
So, bravo.
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

05:56.441 --> 05:59.193
Now that we have Gotham's attention,
it's time for the Maniax

05:59.444 --> 06:00.945
to make a grand entrance.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.197
Wasn't that it?

06:04.032 --> 06:05.491
That was the overture.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.412
Now the audience is hushed, expectant.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.623
The curtain rises...

06:13.666 --> 06:14.667
Then what happens?

06:15.543 --> 06:21.049
Oh, then we confront Gothamites
with their most primal fears.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.469
Take from them all they hold
dear and sacred.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.137
And then what happens?

06:28.014 --> 06:32.894
Why, then we offer them salvation.
And then they are ours.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.605
Let's get busy, man.

06:35.980 --> 06:39.901
Patience. First, you gentlemen
need to learn a little stagecraft.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.820
- Stagecraft?
- You're going to be on TV.

06:43.488 --> 06:45.865
You have to present yourselves
with style and vigor.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.451
Dobkins, say,
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

06:49.160 --> 06:51.287
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.122
Again, with a smile.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.251
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.504
You.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.052
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.972
Not bad. Sinister and authoritative.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.018
Never mind.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.395
Jerome.

07:19.273 --> 07:24.028
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening!

07:26.239 --> 07:29.033
Very good. Boyishly charming.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.870
The laugh is fabulous.
Use that.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.080
Ow!

07:35.540 --> 07:36.582
Ow! Ow!

07:40.503 --> 07:41.504
Oh!

07:41.671 --> 07:43.005
Now me.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.095
I am so glad
that you two are getting along.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.890
But we're a little busy here, so if you
could leave the poor mayor alone.

07:53.099 --> 07:54.433
- We're bored.
- Yeah.

07:54.851 --> 07:56.686
Why do the boys get to have all the fun?

07:56.894 --> 07:59.730
Your time is coming. I told you.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.652
You haven't killed him, have you?

08:05.111 --> 08:06.112
No, I don't think so.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.784
Nope, hanging in there.

08:12.827 --> 08:16.414
When? When is my time coming?

08:17.915 --> 08:20.710
Soon, very soon.

08:22.587 --> 08:24.672
Why don't you tell me about James Gordon?

08:26.841 --> 08:29.302
What do you want to know?

08:42.607 --> 08:43.774
It's hard to believe.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.568
My father's been sneaking
down here for years,

08:45.776 --> 08:47.486
and I never even knew about it.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.364
That makes two of us, doesn't it?

08:52.992 --> 08:55.578
Wait. Let's just think about this.

08:56.454 --> 08:58.623
Are you certain you want to turn
that bloody thing on?

08:58.831 --> 08:59.832
Of course I'm certain.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.792
Have you thought it through, Master Bruce?

09:02.043 --> 09:05.421
This computer could contain all my
father's research into Wayne Enterprises.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.925
All this time, I've been looking
for a smoking gun, and here it is.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.387
Exactly, a smoking gun.
Now, guns are for grown-ups, aren't they?

09:16.474 --> 09:18.351
It's a metaphor, Alfred, not an argument.

09:20.478 --> 09:21.646
Here it is.

09:26.651 --> 09:28.236
It's working! It's working.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.406
What are you doing? Alfred, stop!
What are you doing?

09:32.907 --> 09:36.077
What are you doing, Alfred?
Alfred, stop it! It's ruined!

09:36.661 --> 09:39.163
It's ruined! What's wrong with you?
Why would you do that? Answer me!

09:39.413 --> 09:40.998
It had to be done, Master Bruce.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.668
This was the key to exposing
Wayne Enterprises.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.255
Everything that I've worked for,
everything my dad worked for

09:47.505 --> 09:49.757
is now gone! Because of you!

09:50.007 --> 09:53.511
If I'd known what was down here,
I would have never helped get you in.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.138
I mean, look around you. Look, look.
Liters of blood.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.683
A bulletproof vest with two slugs in it!

09:59.433 --> 10:00.851
Guns, weapons!

10:01.227 --> 10:03.688
I mean, whatever's on that computer
probably killed your father,

10:03.938 --> 10:07.566
and I'll be damned if I see you suffer
the same fate, Master Bruce.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.404
I'm trying to protect you.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.745
I'm trying to keep you safe.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.625
I want you to go.

10:25.418 --> 10:26.419
- Look, I know that you're--
- No.

10:26.711 --> 10:28.004
- Upset, and it's been--
- Alfred.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.925
I want you to go and never come back.
Do you understand me?

10:35.261 --> 10:36.262
You're fired.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.529
Very well, Master Bruce. As you wish.

10:59.035 --> 11:01.287
Ooh, shiny!

11:04.081 --> 11:05.124
Give that back.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.584
I saw it first.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.463
No, you didn't. I said give it back.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.923
Make me, you little brat.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.759
Ooh!

11:16.677 --> 11:19.347
Your samurai skills are excellent,
Greenwood-<i>san,</i>

11:20.222 --> 11:22.516
but they are nothing compared to me.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.103
Prepare to die!

11:29.899 --> 11:32.276
That's enough! I said...

11:32.735 --> 11:34.945
I tried to stop them.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.449
Boys, we're a team.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.451
We don't fight amongst ourselves.

11:40.785 --> 11:43.329
Yeah, we're a team, boys.

11:43.662 --> 11:44.914
And I'm the captain.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.459
Captain of my foot.

11:48.667 --> 11:53.547
I've murdered a dozen women,
terrorized the city.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.426
What have you done? Chop up your mommy?

11:58.260 --> 12:00.054
Everybody has to start somewhere.

12:01.055 --> 12:05.226
See, I have vision,
and ambition, and brains.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.895
You're just a nutty
old cannibal.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.981
How many people can you eat
before that shtick gets old?

12:11.357 --> 12:13.150
I could eat one more.

12:13.484 --> 12:17.279
I can see we're going to have to
resolve this one, once and for all.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.915
You all know this game, right?

12:28.165 --> 12:29.166
Oh, love it.

12:35.089 --> 12:36.173
Who wants to be the boss?

12:38.050 --> 12:39.093
Ladies first.

12:59.113 --> 13:02.950
Hey, Greenwood, what's the secret
to good comedy?

13:05.870 --> 13:09.874
Timing. And what's courage?

13:13.335 --> 13:15.713
Grace under pressure.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.759
And who's the boss?

13:28.434 --> 13:31.479
I'm the boss.

13:36.942 --> 13:41.530
I believe you are, Jerome.
I believe you are.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.033
<i>Arigato, sensei.</i>

13:44.408 --> 13:45.493
Whoo! Hee!

13:47.244 --> 13:48.245
Thank you.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.873
Four lunatics and Barbara?

13:51.332 --> 13:52.917
Brother, you got no luck.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.419
I told you civilian life was better,
didn't I?

13:55.920 --> 13:58.672
Yeah, you did.
Actually, that's kind of why I'm here.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.132
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.592
What are you doing here?

14:03.219 --> 14:05.387
Jim, you remember Scotty, my girlfriend?

14:05.638 --> 14:08.098
- Fiancée.
- Right, my fiancée.

14:08.474 --> 14:09.850
Yeah. Scotty, good to see you.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.645
Relax, honeybun. We're just talking.

14:13.062 --> 14:15.856
Oh, like hell, you are. He's going to ask
you to come back to work.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.526
He didn't ask me anything.
We're just having a chat.

14:18.776 --> 14:19.777
Oh, is that right?

14:19.985 --> 14:22.488
Is that why you're here,
Detective, just to have a chat?

14:23.822 --> 14:27.660
No. No, she's right. Harvey, I need
your help. The case is a bear.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.204
We're short-handed, and I was thinking
maybe you could...

14:30.538 --> 14:33.666
He has a life. The answer is no.
He is not coming back.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.418
Hon. I'm telling him no.

14:37.253 --> 14:38.963
But it's like she said.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.423
I have a life.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.468
I get it. I get it.

14:45.636 --> 14:48.222
I'm happy for you. Just a thought.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.641
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

14:52.268 --> 14:55.104
Jim, one last thing.
One last thought from your Uncle Harvey.

14:57.106 --> 14:59.817
These Maniax killed a bunch of people
from the shipyard, right?

15:01.026 --> 15:02.695
Yellen Shipyard, yeah.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.614
Why there? They could've gone
anywhere, killed anyone.

15:06.824 --> 15:11.704
But these lunatics specifically chose
that shipyard. I wonder why.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.874
Good to see you. Scotty.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.712
Yeah, I'll call you back. Commissioner.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.672
Tell me something good, please.

15:22.006 --> 15:24.133
- Harvey isn't coming back.
- That's not good.

15:24.425 --> 15:26.885
But he did suggest
a lead that panned out nicely.

15:27.261 --> 15:30.347
Turns out the Maniax stole a refueling
truck from the shipyard yesterday.

15:30.556 --> 15:31.682
Why wasn't it reported?

15:32.266 --> 15:33.851
It was one of
over a hundred service vehicles.

15:34.143 --> 15:36.020
Took a while to track down
the entire fleet.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.689
But when we did,
we found that one was missing.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.691
Fully loaded with gasoline.

15:41.025 --> 15:42.151
You get a license plate?

15:42.526 --> 15:45.362
And a description of the vehicle.
Put out an APB.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.197
God, I'm so glad you're back, Jim.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.407
Me, too.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.536
Wish I could say the same for Bullock.

15:53.162 --> 15:55.205
I can't believe he's really gone.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.375
He's a cop. He was born to be a cop.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.669
Not anymore. He's a happy man.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.463
I didn't have it in me to push him.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.424
You ever think about that?

16:06.383 --> 16:07.843
Walking away, I mean.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.554
No. You?

16:10.929 --> 16:12.890
I did, for a long time.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.267
But not anymore?

16:15.726 --> 16:20.230
I've sat back and watched
old, corrupt, lazy men

16:20.481 --> 16:24.568
buy their way into this job and waste it.
Not me, Jim.

16:25.361 --> 16:26.362
Not me.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.448
- A new day.
- You're damn right.

16:50.678 --> 16:52.471
I'd just like to say it's been an honor

16:53.097 --> 16:55.933
and a privilege to serve
you and your family, sir.

16:57.893 --> 16:58.894
Thank you.

16:59.478 --> 17:02.189
If you need any references,
I'll be happy to provide them.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.196
Is that all you're taking with you?

17:11.115 --> 17:12.533
It's all I have, sir.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.499
Right. Well, oh, dear.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.960
Yes, I best be off.
I've got a train to catch.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.924
Goodbye, sir.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.512
Goodbye, Alfred.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.097
Beg your pardon, sir?

17:36.140 --> 17:37.141
I said goodbye.

17:38.434 --> 17:39.435
Yes.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.524
Goodbye, sir.

18:01.749 --> 18:06.044
I spy with my little eye,
something that is...

18:11.300 --> 18:12.384
Yellow.

18:12.634 --> 18:17.181
Score, Gotham, score! We want more!
Hit them where it hurts

18:17.514 --> 18:19.183
and knock them to the floor!

18:19.475 --> 18:20.476
Whoo!

18:22.895 --> 18:24.605
Yay, Gotham!

18:42.831 --> 18:44.708
Oh, hello, Ms. Kringle.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.544
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.421
How is your day going?

18:49.838 --> 18:51.548
Fine.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.550
Um, question for you.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.641
- Yes?
- Um...

19:02.059 --> 19:06.021
Did you know
that house flies hum in the key of F?

19:09.358 --> 19:12.903
No.
No, I did not know that.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.073
Okay, then.

19:19.368 --> 19:22.162
- Well, uh, bye.
- Bye.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.506
Damn it!
We agreed you were going to ask her out.

19:33.966 --> 19:37.761
We didn't agree to ask her,
we agreed to think about asking her.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.763
But there's no point.
She doesn't like you.

19:40.264 --> 19:43.684
<i>Maybe she'll like me.
You ever consider that?</i>

19:44.518 --> 19:46.270
Maybe she'll like me.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.606
I got confidence. Ladies love that.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.860
No, she won't like you.

19:53.819 --> 19:56.071
She won't. Go away.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.784
Please, just go away!

20:06.206 --> 20:07.207
Hey.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.018
Whoo!

20:27.144 --> 20:28.312
Ah!

20:35.027 --> 20:37.654
We got a sighting of the stolen truck.
Yeavely Park.

20:42.159 --> 20:46.705
I want you all to know
this was a very difficult decision for us.

20:47.581 --> 20:51.251
It was between you
and a senior citizen bingo party.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.464
In the end, we decided to skew
a little younger.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.884
Youth won the day. Sorry.

20:59.635 --> 21:00.636
Give me an O!

21:06.308 --> 21:08.602
- I said give me an O.
- O.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.938
- Give me an N.
- N.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.523
- Give me another O!
- O!

21:13.774 --> 21:15.275
What does that spell?

21:15.525 --> 21:17.527
- "O" no!
- "O" no!

21:31.667 --> 21:33.543
Do it, do it, do it!

21:35.420 --> 21:37.255
Ready? Okay!

21:43.971 --> 21:45.889
This is so embarrassing.

21:46.890 --> 21:47.891
Anyone got a light?

21:49.768 --> 21:50.769
I do.

21:58.694 --> 22:01.822
Stand your ground, boys.
They can't shoot at the bus.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.241
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

22:09.246 --> 22:13.875
Aaron, Greenwood, get the truck started.
We're gonna blow this barbeque!

22:27.723 --> 22:29.099
Light 'em up!

23:19.107 --> 23:20.108
<i>I want to go home!</i>

23:21.151 --> 23:23.320
- Everybody okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23:24.821 --> 23:26.448
Who broke you out, Dobkins?

23:26.615 --> 23:28.784
You're gonna have to talk sooner or later.
Tell me now.

23:28.950 --> 23:32.329
I'm a victim here, sir.
I was coerced, abducted and coerced.

23:32.496 --> 23:33.663
- By who?
- If I tell you that,

23:33.830 --> 23:35.165
I gotta get some kind of guaran--

23:39.044 --> 23:40.796
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

24:28.844 --> 24:31.513
I understand
you were just trying to protect me.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.432
But there's nothing,

24:35.267 --> 24:38.979
nothing that you can do to stop me
from carrying out my father's work.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.188
I know that now.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.235
I don't want you to go, Alfred.

24:46.987 --> 24:50.657
But you're either with me,
or you're against me.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.451
And if you're against me,
I don't have a choice.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.747
I'm with you, Master Bruce.
I've always been with you.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.585
But what you're doing
is tantamount to suicide.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.838
This is big boy stuff.
You're too young. You're not ready.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.965
Then make me ready.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.969
You've lived a dangerous life,
and you survived.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.307
So teach me. Teach me how to do the same.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.642
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll train every day.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.144
Yeah, but you said that before,
didn't you?

25:19.311 --> 25:22.772
That was before. Now I know the truth!

25:23.648 --> 25:25.442
And I know what I have to do.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.238
I'll even go back to school, if you want.

25:32.199 --> 25:33.533
School, even?

25:40.123 --> 25:44.211
If I agree to help you, to make you ready,

25:45.503 --> 25:49.591
you must do exactly as I say
and when I say it, with no exceptions.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.051
Is that understood?

25:54.512 --> 25:55.847
Understood.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.520
But, in return,
you must fix that computer.

26:03.438 --> 26:06.983
Fix it? How on Earth am I gonna do that?

26:07.901 --> 26:11.529
That's not my problem.
I'm not the one who broke it.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.581
High caliber, high velocity.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.709
Judging by the size of the wounds,
it was definitely shot from some distance.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.253
Someone knew how to shoot.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.296
Who, damn it?

26:28.630 --> 26:31.174
And why cheerleaders? Where's the motive?

26:31.341 --> 26:33.134
They didn't even ask for a ransom.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.972
They want headlines. They want mass panic.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.807
- Well, they got it.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

26:39.057 --> 26:42.310
Let's see if we can't ID that bullet.
Never know your luck.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.525
- Holding up?
- Holding up.

26:49.276 --> 26:50.277
Love you.

26:50.694 --> 26:51.736
Likewise.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.213
Gin and tonic, please, uh, guv'nor.
Ice and a slice.

27:15.719 --> 27:16.886
Nice place.

27:17.554 --> 27:18.638
It is.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.225
- Been here before, then, have you?
- It's my regular spot.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.103
Oh, right, you're a local. Nice.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.064
Don't I know you?

27:29.524 --> 27:30.525
Do you?

27:31.568 --> 27:32.861
Yeah...

27:34.362 --> 27:38.950
You're that Mr. Fox, that scientific chap
from Wayne Enterprises, isn't ya?

27:39.242 --> 27:40.618
That is me.

27:41.661 --> 27:45.415
Alfred Pennyworth.
Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.418
Ah, yes!

27:50.795 --> 27:52.172
It's a funny old game, though, isn't it?

27:52.339 --> 27:55.633
Coincidence. I mean,
me bumping into you like this. I mean...

27:56.718 --> 27:58.261
I was just thinking about you.

28:02.974 --> 28:03.975
Hmm.

28:05.602 --> 28:09.272
Okay, Mr. Pennyworth, I'll bite.
What were you thinking about me?

28:09.814 --> 28:11.858
Oh, Alfred, please.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.444
Please, Lucius.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.739
Lucius. Lucius.

28:19.574 --> 28:23.286
You know,
I once knew this geezer called Onslow

28:23.453 --> 28:25.997
in the Isle of Dogs,
in the East End of London.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.042
Lairy little scallywag he was.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.836
He was too smiley by half.
Never trusted him.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.464
Anyway, one day, Lucius,
he comes bowling up to me

28:34.631 --> 28:38.676
and he asks me
to do him this right, iffy favor.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.471
It doesn't matter what it was.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.391
The point being,
against my better judgment,

28:45.642 --> 28:46.851
I agreed to do it.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.063
But Lucius,
I told him, I told him straight.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.316
I said, "You let me down, Onslow,

28:54.067 --> 28:57.195
"I will tuck you up,
sunshine, like a kipper."

28:59.864 --> 29:03.410
He swears blind, swears on his mother's
grave he'd never do such a thing.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.996
But, of course, he did.
Couldn't help himself. He let me down.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.292
So I tucked him up.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.587
Like a kipper.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.298
What is a kipper?

29:19.634 --> 29:21.386
It's a type of smoked fish.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.515
Very nice with eggs
and brown toast for breakfast.

29:26.975 --> 29:30.854
But what I learned from Onslow is this.

29:31.855 --> 29:34.274
There are two types of people
on this planet, you see.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.693
Them you can trust

29:39.195 --> 29:40.363
and them you can't.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.323
I cannot disagree.

29:43.658 --> 29:44.868
Which kind are you?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.747
Both kinds of people would
give you the same answer, wouldn't they?

29:49.998 --> 29:53.084
Exactly. Exactly right.

29:53.585 --> 29:59.132
There lieth the problem, Lucius.
You see, I need to confide in you.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.803
But I need to know
that you're trustworthy.

30:04.387 --> 30:08.892
Perhaps I should decline your confidence.
I don't like the sound of these kippers.

30:09.058 --> 30:11.978
Yeah, well,
it's a bit late for that, unfortunately.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.564
I mean, it's you after all,
Lucius, that created this mess

30:14.731 --> 30:19.819
when you told young Master Bruce
that his dear old dead dad was a stoic.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.574
- Ah.
- Ah. Exactly. See, there's the problem.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.911
I got no one else to turn to.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.915
I have to confide in you.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.167
- I see.
- Do you?

30:35.835 --> 30:38.087
Let me just be crystal clear about this.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.592
If it turns out

30:43.092 --> 30:44.677
that I can't trust you,

30:46.012 --> 30:48.264
I swear on my mother's grave,

30:48.932 --> 30:50.683
you, my old sausage,

30:53.269 --> 30:54.395
are a dead man.

30:57.106 --> 31:00.777
I have only the best intentions
for Bruce Wayne.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.409
Well, another gin and tonic,
please, uh, guv'nor.

31:08.576 --> 31:11.246
And whatever this young man's drinking,
one for yourself.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.293
How are you at fixing computers?

31:20.463 --> 31:21.464
Hey, Alvarez.

31:21.673 --> 31:22.799
Yo.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.968
Let Ballistics know
we got a red-ball for them, will ya?

31:25.176 --> 31:26.177
<i>On it.</i>

31:26.344 --> 31:27.345
Gordon.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.973
<i>Hello, Jim. It's Barbara.</i>

31:39.399 --> 31:41.150
Hi, Barbara. How are you?

31:41.526 --> 31:44.362
<i>Oh, me? I'm fabulous. How are you?</i>

31:44.571 --> 31:45.863
I'm good. What's new?

31:46.364 --> 31:47.824
<i>Mr. Cool Guy, huh?</i>

31:49.867 --> 31:51.494
<i>You must be so mad at me.</i>

31:51.661 --> 31:54.539
Listen to me.
If you turn yourself in, I can help you.

31:54.998 --> 31:59.168
<i>How, Jim? By taking me back
to Arkham? I don't think so.</i>

32:00.086 --> 32:01.087
You're sick.

32:01.671 --> 32:05.842
<i>Of course. Everything's always my fault.
So typical.</i>

32:06.759 --> 32:10.555
Listen to me. I know you, Barbara.
I know you.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.932
You're a good, kind woman.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.350
This isn't you.

32:14.642 --> 32:17.854
<i>You could always make me laugh.</i>

32:24.527 --> 32:25.778
How do I look?

32:37.582 --> 32:40.168
I need to talk to Commissioner Essen
right away. It's an emergency.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.878
<i>Yeah, go ahead,
she's right upstairs.</i>

32:42.045 --> 32:43.588
<i>I'm sorry, sir, you said this was...</i>

32:46.966 --> 32:48.092
Yo, Commish.

32:48.259 --> 32:49.260
Yeah.

32:54.641 --> 32:56.309
Heard you were looking for us.

32:59.354 --> 33:00.396
<i>What the hell are...</i>

33:00.897 --> 33:02.482
<i>Put him down!</i>

33:21.417 --> 33:24.837
Barbara! Don't move.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.008
You're wrong about me, Jim.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.845
I tried telling you, but you never listen.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.431
I'm listening now.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.475
Yeah, sure you are. Now.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.268
Come on.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.313
Let's go talk this through, huh?

33:42.480 --> 33:43.856
Oh, it's too late for that.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.208
Ow.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.723
<i>Aaron.</i>

34:18.141 --> 34:19.142
That's enough.

34:28.276 --> 34:30.653
I'm not sick, I'm free.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.321
You don't get that.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.826
I could explain it,
but you should probably get back to work.

34:36.993 --> 34:38.995
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.884
No, please!

35:17.784 --> 35:20.703
Hell of a first week you're having,
Commissioner.

35:21.537 --> 35:25.416
I wish I could tell you
that things were gonna get better for you.

35:25.958 --> 35:26.959
They're not.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.127
<i>Help.</i>

35:29.128 --> 35:30.379
Here, bring that up here.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.007
Get a better angle of the room.

35:33.716 --> 35:34.967
Why are you doing this?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.636
To rule the world.

35:37.053 --> 35:40.640
Blah, blah, blah. But we'll settle
for some dead cops and some good PR.

35:41.891 --> 35:44.143
- Kidding.
- Yeah, whatever, I get it.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.478
You're just crazy.

35:46.062 --> 35:47.563
Crazy?

35:51.609 --> 35:52.902
Look at me.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.738
You can see I'm not crazy.

35:56.906 --> 36:00.827
Very soon, little man, you will be dead,

36:01.577 --> 36:03.663
and the world will go on without you.

36:04.163 --> 36:08.125
You'll be nothing.
No one will even remember your name.

36:08.376 --> 36:09.794
Mmm...

36:10.586 --> 36:15.633
No. That is where you're wrong, old lady.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.053
We will leave a mark on this city.

36:19.220 --> 36:22.598
We will spread across it like a virus.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.726
Do you know why?

36:25.893 --> 36:28.688
There's nothing
more contagious than laughter.

36:32.859 --> 36:33.943
My line.

36:35.236 --> 36:38.322
There's nothing
more contagious than laughter.

36:43.494 --> 36:45.913
That was strangely pleasant. Do it again.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.290
Oh!

36:47.707 --> 36:49.625
That's gonna leave a mark.

36:54.297 --> 36:55.715
You got me.

36:58.009 --> 36:59.343
My turn.

38:03.157 --> 38:04.158
Lee.

38:04.700 --> 38:05.701
Jim!

38:06.327 --> 38:07.328
You hurt?

38:07.536 --> 38:11.040
No, I was in my office
and I heard gunfire, and I hid.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.708
Where were you?

38:12.917 --> 38:14.877
Barbara was here. She lured me away.

38:15.586 --> 38:16.712
Essen!

38:17.630 --> 38:20.383
<i>It's okay. Just breathe.
Breathe. Come on.</i>

38:29.892 --> 38:32.019
Hang on, Cap. Hang on.

38:32.645 --> 38:35.898
Boss. Boss. Stay with me.

38:36.565 --> 38:37.566
Breathe.

38:41.570 --> 38:44.532
It's a new day, Jim.

38:59.672 --> 39:01.590
This is

39:03.092 --> 39:04.260
indeed broken.

39:07.596 --> 39:10.516
- I have a lot of questions for you.
- Ah, I imagine so.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.770
Did my father tell you everything?

39:14.937 --> 39:17.773
Heavens, no.
Your father, he was a very private man.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.192
He had to be.

39:20.693 --> 39:24.572
I simply helped with technical resources,
like this computer.

39:27.324 --> 39:28.325
Do you know what's on it?

39:29.035 --> 39:31.078
No. I didn't wanna know, to be honest.

39:32.455 --> 39:35.332
- But you can fix it?
- Mmm, I should think so.

39:35.833 --> 39:39.170
But it is going to take some time.

39:45.468 --> 39:49.388
Well, uh, thank you, for your help.

39:53.476 --> 39:55.269
I loved your father.

39:56.479 --> 39:58.355
I regret that I never told him so.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.568
I regret that I didn't help him more.

40:08.157 --> 40:10.576
Hand me the soldering iron, will you?

40:11.994 --> 40:12.995
Yeah.

40:16.916 --> 40:17.917
Master Bruce.

40:18.709 --> 40:19.710
What is it, Alfred?

40:21.003 --> 40:24.090
Okay. How you doing, Mr. Nygma?

40:24.799 --> 40:27.510
Okay, two aspirin for you. You're welcome.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.389
Detective Gordon!

40:34.809 --> 40:35.810
Bruce.

40:36.519 --> 40:37.812
I heard the news.

40:38.187 --> 40:39.855
I was worried something happened to you.

40:42.066 --> 40:43.109
I'm very relieved.

40:44.735 --> 40:45.736
Me, too.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.366
The last time that we met,
I was very hard on you.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.244
I wanted to apologize.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.580
You've been a really good friend.

41:20.563 --> 41:22.481
<i>She was a good woman.</i>

41:27.403 --> 41:29.238
Good cop.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.209
It's good to see you,
but you don't have to do this.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.421
Let's not talk about it.

41:45.963 --> 41:48.090
We are who we are, right?

41:48.716 --> 41:50.467
No use fighting it.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.262
What did Scotty say?

41:54.096 --> 41:55.931
She'll understand,

41:56.599 --> 41:57.892
or she won't.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.269
Guys. You need to see this.

42:00.895 --> 42:03.772
<i>I'm reporting live from
the scene of the G.C.P.D. massacre.</i>

42:03.939 --> 42:06.525
<i>We have just obtained
video footage of the attack</i>

42:06.692 --> 42:08.652
<i>recorded by one of the assailants.</i>

42:08.819 --> 42:13.115
I wanna warn those of you watching,
what you're about to see is very graphic.

42:15.743 --> 42:19.455
<i>Hello, Gotham City! We're the Maniax.</i>

42:19.622 --> 42:24.210
<i>And I'm Jerome,
the shot-caller of our little gang.</i>

42:24.376 --> 42:28.339
<i>We're here to spread the message
of wisdom and hope</i>.

42:31.467 --> 42:33.177
<i>Some people have no manners.</i>

42:35.846 --> 42:38.599
<i>You're all prisoners.</i>

42:39.725 --> 42:44.772
<i>What you call sanity
is just a prison in your minds</i>

42:44.939 --> 42:48.025
<i>that stops you from seeing
that you're just tiny, little cogs</i>

42:48.192 --> 42:50.861
<i>in a giant absurd machine.</i>

42:51.028 --> 42:52.863
<i>Wake up!</i>

42:54.907 --> 42:56.492
<i>Why be a cog?</i>

42:56.659 --> 42:59.203
<i>Be free like us.</i>

42:59.536 --> 43:00.579
<i>Just like him!</i>

43:01.872 --> 43:02.873
<i>Smile!</i>

43:07.294 --> 43:08.963
<i>Oh, time to go.</i>

43:10.965 --> 43:14.009
<i>But don't worry, we'll be back very soon.</i>

43:14.426 --> 43:17.888
<i>Hang on to your hats, folks,
'cause you ain't seen nothing yet!</i>
