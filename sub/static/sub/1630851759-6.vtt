19:19.976 --> 19:22.126
Sydney, why are you writing
a song that you don't like?

19:22.228 --> 19:24.979
It doesn't matter what I like
because according to the data,

19:25.098 --> 19:27.064
this is what my fans like.

19:28.151 --> 19:31.102
Okay. How'd it feel when you
got all those positive comments?

19:31.637 --> 19:33.821
Great. Like I could
do anything.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.806
And how'd it feel when you
got all the negative ones?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.359
Awful. Like I couldn't
do anything.

give so much power

19:53.676 --> 19:55.176
As much as I like getting
all those matches,

19:55.328 --> 19:57.345
they're not matching
with the real me.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.014

gonna go back to being

That's good for you,
dad, but this different.

20:04.888 --> 20:07.021
I mean, isn't the whole
point of writing music

20:07.140 --> 20:10.007
making something that people
actually wanna listen to?

20:10.059 --> 20:12.843
Well, sure, but you still have
to write songs that you love.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.529
And if little girls like
lily are inspired by it,

20:15.681 --> 20:18.199
then that's an added bonus.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.185
You're right. I mean,

20:21.237 --> 20:22.853
the reason I started
writing songs

20:22.956 --> 20:24.538
was so my voice
could be heard.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.909
You know what? I'm gonna
keep posting my music

20:28.044 --> 20:29.577

the comments.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.212

-I'm proud of you, too.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.384
In fact, you've inspired me
to write a song

20:36.502 --> 20:38.636
about how vanilla is the most
underrated flavor.

20:38.721 --> 20:41.505
-I love that idea.
-I'm not accepting
comments, dad.
