WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:02.921
Previously...

00:03.040 --> 00:04.041
I've come home.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.564
Turn in my own brother?

00:05.640 --> 00:07.768
Canna let ye risk
yer lives for me any longer.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.844
Have ye not seen the inside of
enough prisons for one lifetime

00:10.920 --> 00:12.001
Tell him ye heard from me.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.880
He'll now know once and for all
you have no allegiance to Red Jamie.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.724
John Grey is my brother.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.404
He owed you a debt of honour.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.925
Can't even shoot the bastard.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.690
If ye believe yer wife to be a witch,
then who am I to contradict ye?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.966
It's another vision.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.963
La Dame Blanche, the white lady.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.646
We'll raise the child as our own,
with a father.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.250
A living, breathing man.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.129
Where'd she get the red hair

00:36.200 --> 00:39.443
Claire, when I'm with you, I'm with you,
but you're with him.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.166
I threw myself into my new role
as basil could,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.169
but there was still something missing.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.005
I knew eventually
I would need to do something more.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.691
Sing me a song

00:50.760 --> 00:53.491
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.680 --> 00:56.411
Say, could that lass

00:56.480 --> 00:58.448
Be Y?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.323
Merry of soul

01:01.400 --> 01:04.290
She sailed on a day

01:04.440 --> 01:06.647
Over the sea

01:06.720 --> 01:09.041
To Skye

01:09.680 --> 01:12.001
Billow and breeze

01:12.080 --> 01:14.731
Islands and seas

01:14.800 --> 01:19.522
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.200 --> 01:22.441
Al! that was good

01:22.760 --> 01:25.001
All that was fair

01:25.520 --> 01:27.568
All that was me

01:27.640 --> 01:30.086
ls gone

01:30.560 --> 01:32.847
Sing me a song

01:32.920 --> 01:35.764
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.840 --> 01:38.207
Say, could that lass

01:38.280 --> 01:39.964
Be Y?

01:40.960 --> 01:43.247
Merry of soul

01:43.320 --> 01:46.085
She sailed on a day

01:46.240 --> 01:49.767
Over the sea

01:50.240 --> 01:55.451
To Skye

02:29.040 --> 02:30.041
Is that what I think it is

02:30.400 --> 02:32.926
It is. A full English breakfast.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.371
Black pudding?

02:35.440 --> 02:36.521
Fingers off.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.726
- And bread fried in bacon fat?
- Well, of course.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.926
What's the occasion?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.049
Well, Brianna came home
from school the other day

02:44.120 --> 02:47.124
and asked for Eggo toaster waffles.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.806
So I've decided she
needs more English-ness in her life.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.565
And your plan is what? Are you going
to feed the American-ness out of her?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.769
Well, it's either that,

02:55.840 --> 02:58.446
or I replace her beloved
Dr Seuss with Dickens.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.808
Brianna, breakfast is ready.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.765
That's delicious. I've missed that.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.446
Good. Perhaps I'm onto something.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.886
You know, I don't have class tonight,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.449
and I've read about
as much as I can about gallbladders.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.963
Maybe we could go see a film later.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.247
Joe said The Searchers was fantastic.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.923
Or, you know,
if you're not in the mood for a western,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.161
we could go see Carousel.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.005
No, that sounds... That sounds lovely.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.926
- I've seen them both.
- Both, really?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.401
YES.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.164
- We...
- No, no, I'm sorry.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.329
We agreed we were free to...

03:50.400 --> 03:51.845
No, of course.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.963
I'm being discreet, Claire.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.045
Yes, you are. Thank you.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.771
- There she is.
- For you.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.290
That's wonderful, darling.
Really lovely.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.731
Is it always so gloomy?

04:24.800 --> 04:28.521
Chin up, My Lord.
The drink here is fine compensation.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.161
I left you a list of booze-merchants.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.330
Paperwork's the worst of the duty.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.880
After that there's
not a great deal to do, really,

04:37.640 --> 04:42.123
save to hunt for grouse
and Frenchman's Gold.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.321
The fortune in bullion

04:43.400 --> 04:44.925
that Louis of France
sent to Charles Stuart?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.810
They say the Highland army hid it
somewhere on the moor.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.403
I was captivated by it my first year,
determined to find it.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.002
But after a few years,
I finally yielded to my better senses.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.404
However, the man that does deliver
a treasure such as that to London

05:02.400 --> 05:04.448
would certainly
have the attention of the Crown.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.846
I understand the prisoners
to be mostly Jacobite Highlanders.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.082
Yes, and docile as sheep.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.128
No heart in them after Culloden.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.721
God, I'll be glad
lo get back to civilisation.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.440
Not much in the way
of local society, I gather

05:23.240 --> 05:27.370
My dear fellow.
"Society" will consist solely

05:27.440 --> 05:29.249
of conversation with your officers...

05:31.000 --> 05:32.490
And one prisoner.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.041
A prisoner

05:34.520 --> 05:36.443
You'll have heard of Red Jamie Fraser

05:37.520 --> 05:38.601
Of course.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.091
The man was notorious during the Rising.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.525
Well, we have him.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.084
He's the only Jacobite officer here

05:44.160 --> 05:46.527
and the only man we keep chained.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.604
Lasted as a fugitive
for six years after Culloden.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.126
Prisoners treat him as their chief.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.645
They call him Mac Dubh.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.166
I don't know what it means,
a sign of respect of some sort.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.607
If matters arise,
he acts as their spokesman.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.491
Guards are all afraid of him.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.121
Those that fought at Prestonpans
say he's the Devil himself.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.441
Poor Devil now.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.483
You'll need Fraser's
goodwill and cooperation.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.210
I had him take supper with me
once a week.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.611
You might try a similar arrangement.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.125
I'll not dine with that...

06:16.080 --> 06:17.081
Prisoner.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.600
As you wish.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.527
Well, I'll leave you lo it.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.806
Good luck, Major.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.164
Have ye seen the new governor yet?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.970
I had a look at him in the yard.
We havena spoken.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.042
Well, better the Devil ye ken,
than the Devil ye don't.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.322
Mac Dubh, am I wrong?

06:48.920 --> 06:50.922
No, Hayes, you're not wrong.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.245
But I canna say if you're right yet.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.881
For you, Mac Dubh.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.730
So... '(ewe seen me new governor, men

07:33.120 --> 07:35.600
Is that what the neep-heids
were blathering about?

07:38.760 --> 07:39.761
Aye.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.326
I've SEEN him.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.411
Seems familiar.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.325
I canna place him.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.690
Name is Grey.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.245
Matters not. All the mollies look alike.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.284
Take God's own eye
to tell one from another.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.364
They say the same about us.

08:13.280 --> 08:17.922
They could tell well enough
if they allowed us to wear our tartans.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.610
Best tuck that away.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.449
Ye know the punishment for having it.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.401
Aye.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.645
So... Ye took no measure of the man?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.164
He's gey young.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.523
Looks scarce more than a bairn.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.050
Carries himself well.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.170
Shoulders square,

08:53.520 --> 08:55.921
and a ramrod up his arse.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.805
The ramrod is standard issue
in the British army.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.081
- Ye've been bitten again.
- Aye.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.761
The rats are growing uncommon bold.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.609
This'll help with the festering.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.886
And Ia grippe as well.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.442
Not more of yer damn thistles.
Do ye think me a pig?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.286
Stubborn as one.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.691
It's only milk thistle.

09:29.800 --> 09:35.091
Take the heads off,
mash the leaves, stems.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.043
I learnt the trick from...

09:50.160 --> 09:51.446
A lass...

09:54.160 --> 09:57.050
Who knew a fair amount

09:58.400 --> 09:59.686
about healing.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.249
The prisoner, sir, as commanded.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.886
James Fraser.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.001
Aye.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.524
I am Major John William Grey,
the governor of this prison.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.882
I believe you and Colonel Quarry
had an understanding.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.161
We did.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.811
I would like to continue that.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.769
You acting as spokesman
for the prisoners.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.081
Fine.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.087
Where would you like
your supper served, sir

10:57.920 --> 10:59.410
In here, prisoner, if you please.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.049
Damn my eyes! It's after my supper.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.880
Has the prison got a cat?

11:10.120 --> 11:11.610
There're cats in the storerooms.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.489
Well, fetch one up here at once.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.965
Are there many rats in the cells?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.280
Great many.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.886
They sometimes scurry across my chest
whilst I'm sleeping, sir.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.327
If you will, MacKay,

11:26.400 --> 11:29.210
please ensure that each prison cell
is provided with its own cat.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.244
Something the matter, MacKay?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.084
With respect, sir,

11:41.040 --> 11:45.011
I dinna think the men would care
to have a cat taking all their rats.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.601
Surely, the prisoners don't eat them?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.490
Only when they're
lucky enough to catch one.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.520
God knows what you did to be sent here,

12:04.400 --> 12:05.640
but for your own sake,

12:07.520 --> 12:09.204
I hope you deserved it.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.805
Will that be all then, sir

12:14.520 --> 12:17.046
Yes. For now.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.444
Mama, hold your diploma up a bit higher.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.447
Three, two, one, cheese.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.691
Very good.
All right, who's next, maestro?

12:36.760 --> 12:39.001
- Just you and Mommy now.
- Okay.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.005
Me and Mommy.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.001
All right, all right.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.284
Darling, shouldn't you
be leaving for Fontaines

12:51.360 --> 12:53.089
I don't want you
to miss your reservation.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.366
There's plenty of time.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.090
- Really?
-It's at 7:00.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.007
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Daddy?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.641
I wish I could, my angel,
but I have some work I need to finish.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.002
- If you're not going, I'm not going.
- Bree?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.445
You'll have a lovely time, I promise.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.489
I thought the reservation was at 6:00.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.162
No. Sorry, it's 7:00.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.242
Don't worry,
we'll be out of your hair soon enough.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.846
- Calling Dr Randall.
- Excuse me.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.809
Dr Joe's salvation elixir.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.881
Is this your prescription
for everything?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.281
Nothing a cold martini won't cure.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.642
You are going to be a horrible doctor.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.126
May I help you?

13:43.120 --> 13:44.281
I'm sorry. I...

13:44.840 --> 13:45.921
Claire?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.365
Bree, go and play.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.450
Your work, I presume

14:04.520 --> 14:06.841
Here, my darling. Everyone...

14:07.880 --> 14:11.771
I have an idea.
Why don't we go to the restaurant now

14:11.840 --> 14:13.569
And if they can't seat us early,

14:13.640 --> 14:15.881
we'll just entertain ourselves
at the bar.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.365
The Devil Halt!

14:47.960 --> 14:49.086
Bring me that man!

14:51.400 --> 14:54.210
Who are you, sir?
How do you come by this place

14:54.560 --> 14:56.403
The gold is cursed.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.165
Did he just say gold?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.081
Take him with us.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.203
The gold... The gold is cursed.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.291
Mr Fraser.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.730
Thank you for coming.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.448
I summoned you
because a situation has arisen

15:27.520 --> 15:28.931
in which I require your assistance.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.404
And what might that be, sir

15:32.800 --> 15:33.926
A man named Duncan Kerr

15:34.000 --> 15:36.207
has been found wandering
the moor near the coast.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.170
He appears to be gravely ill,
near death even,

15:39.240 --> 15:40.730
and his speech is deranged.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.289
However, certain matters
to which he refers appear to be of...

15:45.440 --> 15:47.807
Substantial interest to the Crown.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.971
Unfortunately, the man in question

15:50.040 --> 15:52.520
has been heard to babble
in a mixture of Gaelic and French,

15:53.040 --> 15:55.088
with no more
than a word or two of English.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.010
And you would like my assistance

15:58.080 --> 16:00.811
to translate
what this man might have to say

16:01.280 --> 16:03.487
I've been told
you speak both Gaelic and French.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.681
We haven't much time.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.682
I fear I must decline, sir.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.443
Might I inquire as to why, Mr Fraser

16:17.640 --> 16:20.803
I'm a prisoner. Not an interpreter.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.926
Mr Fraser,

16:25.360 --> 16:26.771
if you do what I ask,

16:27.960 --> 16:29.610
I will have your irons struck off.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.767
I understand you've been wearing them
for three years.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.888
I can't imagine
how heavy they must feel.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.609
I have, however, two conditions.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.490
You give a full and true account
of whatever the fellow says,

16:50.560 --> 16:54.042
and you relay to no one, save me,
any information you glean.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.086
And I have but one condition, sir.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.164
That you provide blankets and medicine
for all the men that are ill.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.321
A most ambitious request.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.204
We're in short supply of both
and I can't possibly bring that about.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.082
Then this conversation is over, sir.
Return the irons if you must.

17:14.160 --> 17:18.290
Mr Fraser, believe me when I tell you
that I would honour your request

17:19.520 --> 17:20.851
if I were able.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.688
I would settle for one man, then.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.362
My kinsman, Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

17:36.240 --> 17:40.689
He's been struggling
to survive here ever since Culloden.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.527
I will inquire
as to what we have in stores.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.841
Then you have a bargain, sir.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.644
You invited her here?

18:02.200 --> 18:03.725
Where our daughter lives.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.124
You were taking the car,

18:08.200 --> 18:11.409
so she was just picking me up.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.042
You really dislike me that much?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.726
It's my graduation,
for God's sake, Frank.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.162
You humiliated me
in front of my new colleagues.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.881
Welcome to the club.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.210
What the hell does that mean?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.442
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake Brianna.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.205
- What does that mean?
-It means...

18:33.960 --> 18:35.166
H means

18:35.520 --> 18:38.046
you're not as good an actress
as you think you are, Claire.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.082
Do you honestly think anyone at Harvard
believes that we're happily married?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.360
You've convinced no one.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.801
And let's not forget,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.762
it was your idea to lead separate lives.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.889
Yes, but you agreed to be discreet.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.008
And having your blonde harlot

18:57.080 --> 18:58.844
show up on our doorstep
is quite the opposite of that.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.843
Do not call her that.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.366
Sandy has a PhD. fellowship
in historical linguistics.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.329
- She's no fucking harlot.
- Does she?

19:05.720 --> 19:08.246
Well, I'm sure you two
will have plenty to discuss, then.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.367
Are you jealous now

19:10.240 --> 19:11.321
Green ain't your colour, Claire.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.606
Go to hell.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.401
You knew how important today was to me.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.165
You did this deliberately.
You wanted to hurt me.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.201
Maybe I did.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.646
Maybe I wanted to give you
a taste of your own medicine,

19:28.960 --> 19:30.121
Dr Randall.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.688
Have you fucked her in our bedroom?

19:41.800 --> 19:43.006
Have you?

19:50.360 --> 19:53.011
I think our bedroom
is far too crowded already.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.641
Wouldn't you agree?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.441
Fine.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.609
Let's stop with the pretence, Frank.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.371
File for divorce.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.367
Divorce?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.441
Why not?

20:26.280 --> 20:27.406
You'd have your freedom.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.367
YES.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.481
I would.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.211
When Jerry divorced Millie a year ago,

20:42.800 --> 20:45.963
he gained his freedom,
but he lost his children for it.

20:48.240 --> 20:52.689
The court ruled that a child
needs a mother more than his father.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.931
He rarely sees them now.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.006
I will not let that happen
to Brianna and me.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.321
I would never keep Bree from you.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.850
Well, we could work out a compromise.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.446
Forgive me, Claire, if I don't
risk everything on your promises.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.409
You have not been
very good at keeping them.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.449
Anything else you'd like to discuss

21:19.760 --> 21:21.091
while we're here?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.727
Jesus Christ.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.007
There is a reason why we are so

21:41.320 --> 21:43.800
terribly bad at charades, my darling.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.088
Be still, friend.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.882
All you say will be told to the English.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.771
What do you...

22:19.720 --> 22:21.404
...know of the Frenchman's gold?

22:24.040 --> 22:25.087
The gold

22:25.720 --> 22:27.324
is cursed.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.567
Do ye be warned, lad.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.765
She hid them.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.281
Aye.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.011
It is theirs...

22:41.120 --> 22:42.406
...she says it.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.851
For the sake of him who is dead.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.321
Her brothers and her home.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.846
She is death.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.530
He is dead.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.448
The MacKenzie is dead.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.809
The gold, man.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.564
Where is the gold?

23:08.360 --> 23:09.521
All of them...

23:11.520 --> 23:13.204
All dead!

23:14.600 --> 23:15.601
Comm ...

23:16.200 --> 23:17.201
Dougal...

23:18.040 --> 23:19.451
...Ellen too!

23:22.040 --> 23:23.371
Folk do say,

23:24.080 --> 23:25.969
how Ellen MacKenzie

23:26.920 --> 23:28.046
did leave...

23:28.600 --> 23:30.204
...and go to wed...

23:30.280 --> 23:32.362
...with a selkie from the sea.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.766
She says it.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.241
The gold.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.364
Man, where is the gold?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.290
Do ye be warned, lad.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.921
It was given by the ban-druidh,

23:48.280 --> 23:50.123
the white witch.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.171
Who is she?

24:05.400 --> 24:06.890
The white witch?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.528
She seeks a brave man.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.971
A MacKenzie.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.847
Aye.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.441
Speak to me, man.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.961
Tell me again.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.006
She will come for you.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.965
Well, Mr Fraser,

24:43.840 --> 24:45.285
tell me what he said.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.080
Speaking of white witches and selchs.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.730
Selchs? White witches?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.211
That's it?

25:09.920 --> 25:11.160
You're holding back.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.082
I keep my bargains, sir.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.640
Do you, Mr Fraser

25:17.800 --> 25:20.007
I suspect there is more to this story.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.885
I can force you to talk.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.606
There's nothing you can do
that hasn't already been done to me,

25:29.560 --> 25:30.561
So...

25:32.440 --> 25:33.601
Try if you must.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.603
We will speak again, Mr Fraser.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.687
Happy birthday to you

25:58.680 --> 26:00.205
Well, I know what I'm wishing for.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.648
Well, don't waste it on a car.
Because you're not getting one.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.371
Wish away. You never know.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.726
This is worse
than yer last putrid concoction.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.406
It's all I can manage.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.440
What happened with Kerr?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.604
His speech was a mad rant.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.331
Not much made sense.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.763
Said the gold was cursed.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.651
Mentioned something about...

26:49.920 --> 26:52.287
Get on with it before I die of old age.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.966
A white witch

26:59.520 --> 27:02.490
who had some connection to the gold.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.403
A white witch?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.485
And ye're thinking...

27:12.440 --> 27:13.851
After all these years?

27:15.400 --> 27:16.561
Of course not.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.322
But is it even possible?

27:20.800 --> 27:21.881
I dinna ken.

27:25.440 --> 27:30.480
I wish we could know what became of her
once you sent her through the stones.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.329
Wishing will no' bring her back.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.882
But I think of her every now and then.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.291
And the wee bairn that she was carrying.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.285
Try not to think of it.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.087
It will only bring ye
pain and suffering.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.168
Can I at least pray them sound?

27:56.160 --> 27:58.162
Fraser, get up.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.887
Aye. That ye can.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.442
I am told you
used to dine with Colonel Quarry.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.644
I trust
you'll do me the same honour now.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.763
You think yer pleasantness
will loosen my tongue

28:24.840 --> 28:25.841
Of course I didn't mean...

28:25.920 --> 28:27.922
Ye can return me to the cells,
if ye have that in mind.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.571
Mr Fraser, I only ask
for you to dine with me

28:30.640 --> 28:32.130
in attempt to forge
a connection between us

28:32.200 --> 28:33.690
better suited to our situation here.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.521
Lovely.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.601
Fine.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.566
Then I'll ask your leave

29:06.760 --> 29:08.125
to hunt for ourselves,

29:08.760 --> 29:11.366
since the Crown cannot supply
the men with adequate food.

29:11.840 --> 29:12.841
Hunt?

29:14.160 --> 29:16.561
Give you weapons
and allow you to wander the moors?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.810
God's teeth, Mr Fraser.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.041
Not weapons.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.006
And not wandering.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.769
Give us leave to set snares
upon the moor when we're cutting peats.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.083
And keep such meat as we take.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.802
We could also gather watercresses, sir.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.361
What for

29:34.800 --> 29:35.801
To eat.

29:35.880 --> 29:36.927
Why?

29:37.320 --> 29:40.130
Well, eating green plants
will stop ye getting scurvy.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.890
Wherever did you get that notion?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.406
From my wife.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.165
You're married?

29:52.760 --> 29:54.091
She's gone.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.961
I see.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.927
Well...

30:03.400 --> 30:05.687
I shall take your proposal
under consideration.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.611
Now may we please begin?

30:11.240 --> 30:12.571
The pheasant will get cold.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.767
Extremely feeble-minded bird,
all but beg to be shot.

30:17.360 --> 30:21.206
Nonetheless, quite tasty
in a wine sauce, wouldn't you agree?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.321
Aye.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.725
Vin de Bourgogne.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.281
The sauce.

30:49.880 --> 30:50.927
I...

30:55.800 --> 30:57.325
I'm not sure.

31:06.200 --> 31:10.762
We had roast pheasant in a wine sauce.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.688
- Red wine?
- Aye.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.129
Aye, vin de Bourgogne.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.650
Yeah, the bird was served with

31:20.080 --> 31:21.570
carrots and nips,

31:22.880 --> 31:24.120
fresh herbs,

31:25.360 --> 31:27.283
crescent rolls topped with butter.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.603
Slow down, Mac Dubh.
I want to savour every morsel.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.241
Then we had fresh salmon...

31:54.360 --> 31:55.646
We're just checking the snares.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.643
Aye, the governor said that we could.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.529
- Stay on them.
- Yes, sir.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.366
Come on, lads. Slow down.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.209
- Stay with them.
- On it, sir.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.846
Easy, boys.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.050
- I've got nothing.
- I've got one!

32:16.480 --> 32:17.641
That's my snare.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.768
Rubbish, this is my one.
- No, it's not.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.969
Yer just jealous
because I've got one and you havena.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.361
Escaped.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.004
You check behind that brush.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.969
Are you sure the patrol
caught sight of him here

32:50.040 --> 32:53.328
Yes, sir. Thought they saw him
swimming out to the islands.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.643
I want the cliffs
searched in both directions.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.809
Keep an eye out for boats below.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.925
God knows there's room enough to hide
a sloop behind some of those islands.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.725
If he went in anywhere
along this stretch, Major,

33:04.360 --> 33:06.124
you'll have seen the last of him.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.129
Sir, it's been three days now.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.284
I do not need reminding, Corporal.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.444
Remain here until nightfall,
then return to the moor.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.969
Yeah, that's how it's done,
William Grey,

33:38.560 --> 33:40.483
second son of Viscount Melton.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.361
How long did it take
yer comrades to find ye

33:48.440 --> 33:50.044
after we tied ye to that tree?

33:52.320 --> 33:54.129
Were ye there so long
as to shite yerself?

33:57.560 --> 33:58.891
- You remembered.
- Aye.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.567
After ye called me
to yer quarters that first day.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.650
I tend to remember anyone
who tries to slit my throat.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.724
Why did you not speak of it before?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.290
I was waiting for the proper occasion.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.489
Why did ye not remind me?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.050
I think you know why.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.808
You may be indifferent
to yer own welfare,

34:27.880 --> 34:31.851
but perhaps ye may have some concern
for this lady's honour.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.002
All right! Release the lady and...

34:35.239 --> 34:37.083
I will tell you whatever you wish.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.886
They were the actions of a foolish boy
and I regret them to this very day.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.130
The mere memory of them
burns shame into my gut.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.371
But fortunately for you,
my foolishness at Corrieyairack

34:48.480 --> 34:52.166
saved your life at Culloden. Did it not?

34:53.199 --> 34:54.201
Aye.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.842
Your brother, Lord Melton,
was an honourable gentleman.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.521
And my family debt to you
has been discharged.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.490
But not yer promise.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.641
Promise?

35:07.160 --> 35:08.844
When last we parted...

35:16.440 --> 35:17.680
You vowed...

35:18.840 --> 35:20.205
I owe you my life.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.802
I should hope to discharge
that debt in the future.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.444
And once it is discharged,
I will kill you.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.801
Well, sir...

35:39.800 --> 35:40.881
Here I am.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.964
I am not a murderer
of unarmed prisoners.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.365
I told ye faithfully
all that Kerr told me that night.

36:36.840 --> 36:42.802
What I didna tell ye was some
of what he said had meaning to me.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.681
What meaning was that?

36:50.440 --> 36:52.090
I spoke to you of my wife.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.241
Yes.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.362
- You said she was dead.
- I said she was gone.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.291
She was a healer.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.050
A white lady.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.848
The word in Gaelic is ban-druidh.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.601
It also means "witch".

37:14.440 --> 37:15.566
The white witch.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.447
So the man's words
referred to your wife?

37:20.680 --> 37:21.920
I thought they might be.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.482
And if so,
I had to go to see for myself.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.922
There was nothing there to do with her.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.964
She is truly gone.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.764
And the gold, Mr Fraser

37:41.480 --> 37:43.847
King Louis never sent gold
to the Stuarts.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.885
All I found was an empty box
save for one jewel.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.967
It is a moving story, Mr Fraser.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.882
Yet there is no evidence
that is the truth.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.522
I give ye my word my story is true.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.685
And I have this as well.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.691
I saved it...

38:10.080 --> 38:13.243
Thinking it might be useful
if ever I were to be freed.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.120
Mary Peterson.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.126
Sandra Phillips.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.285
Brianna Randall.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.081
That's my girl.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.001
Kevin Riley.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.645
- Amanda Ross.
- I'm so proud of you.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.890
Megan Sanborne.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.401
Fitzgibbons is over there.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.801
What's this, then?

39:13.240 --> 39:16.847
The governor ordered me to accompany
the doctor here to treat your kinsman.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.922
It's good to see your friend,
Fitzgibbons, is better.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.047
Aye.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.241
Very much.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.520
After three months
of tending by your physician,

39:47.600 --> 39:50.046
he's in fine fettle.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.761
Why...

39:53.360 --> 39:56.250
Ye cunning wee bastard.
Where the hell did ye learn that trick?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.925
My elder brother taught it to me.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.169
- Lord Melton, you mean.
- Yes.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.484
Your brother very stubbornly
refused to shoot me.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.286
I wasna inclined to be grateful
for the favour at the time.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.325
You wished to be shot?

40:11.080 --> 40:12.366
I thought I had reason.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.326
What reason was that?

40:15.120 --> 40:17.566
I mean no impertinence
in asking. It is only...

40:19.000 --> 40:21.765
At that time, I felt similarly.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.001
I..

40:25.520 --> 40:26.726
Lost...

40:27.160 --> 40:28.969
A particular friend at Culloden.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.044
He was the reason I joined the army.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.247
He...

40:39.480 --> 40:40.720
Inspired me.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.608
My brother was there
when I found him dying.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.607
I didn't even have the chance
to say a proper goodbye.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.965
Hal dragged me away.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.805
He was embarrassed, you see.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.805
He said I would overcome it.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.090
Come to terms with it. In time.

41:12.960 --> 41:16.681
Hal is generally right, but not always.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.727
Some people, you grieve over forever.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.521
Do you find your life
greatly burdensome, Mr Fraser

41:33.840 --> 41:34.841
Perhaps...

41:37.200 --> 41:38.804
Not greatly so.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.971
I think perhaps
the greatest burden lies in

41:45.680 --> 41:47.887
caring for those we cannot help.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.405
Not in having no one for whom to care.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.527
That is

41:55.680 --> 41:56.727
emptiness.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.891
But no great burden.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.361
Your wife,

42:04.320 --> 42:05.651
she was a healer, you said?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.641
She was.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.367
She...

42:19.320 --> 42:20.367
Claire.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.645
Her name was Claire.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.766
You cared for her very much, I think.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.730
I meant to thank you some time, Major.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.846
Thank me

42:37.920 --> 42:38.921
For what?

42:39.920 --> 42:43.322
That night we first met
at Corrieyairack.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.811
For what ye did for my wife.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.921
Perhaps ye may have some concern
for this lady's honour?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.365
Let her go!

42:53.160 --> 42:57.210
All right, release the lady and I
will tell you whatever you wish.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.806
- That was your wife?
- Yeah.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.360
You were a worthy foe. Do you blame me

43:07.200 --> 43:08.361
If you found a 16-year-old

43:08.480 --> 43:11.006
shitting himself with fear
a worthy opponent, Mr Fraser,

43:11.080 --> 43:13.447
it is little wonder
the Highland army was defeated.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.964
Well, a man that doesna shit himself
with a knife held to his throat

43:17.040 --> 43:19.327
has either no bowels, or no brains.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.688
Ye wouldna speak to save yer own life,

43:21.760 --> 43:23.922
but ye would to save
the honour of a lady.

43:24.520 --> 43:25.806
I admire that.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.644
Your wife was in no danger at all.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.969
But ye didna ken that at the time.

43:30.680 --> 43:35.811
Ye thought to save her life
and her virtue at the risk of yer own.

43:36.920 --> 43:39.241
I've thought of that now
and again since...

43:41.080 --> 43:42.525
Since I lost her.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.401
I see.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.167
I am sorry for your loss.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.930
Take yer hand off me,

44:21.800 --> 44:23.245
or I will kill you.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.765
Tough surgery?

45:05.200 --> 45:06.645
I can tell by just looking at you.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.289
They all seem tough these days.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.484
You've done what you can.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.091
- Yes.
- Worrying about it now won't change it.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.610
Well, I've said it all before.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.367
You have.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.731
What is it?

45:32.400 --> 45:35.927
I'd like to take Brianna to England.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.445
That's lovely.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.131
How long would you go for

45:40.800 --> 45:41.801
Well...

45:43.680 --> 45:46.206
I've been offered a position
at Cambridge.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.361
A good one.

45:50.920 --> 45:51.921
An offer

45:53.040 --> 45:55.930
What about the hospital? My patients?

45:57.040 --> 46:00.601
Frank, I cant leave Boston
and move to England.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.523
I'm not asking you to leave.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.724
I want a divorce, Claire.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.131
A divorce?

46:14.760 --> 46:15.761
Yes.

46:20.040 --> 46:23.283
We talked about this
years ago and you said...

46:23.360 --> 46:24.964
No, I know what I said.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.244
But Brianna's 18 now.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.449
- Does she know about this plan?
- No...

46:31.880 --> 46:32.881
Not yet.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.926
But I think she'll come.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.007
Between med school and the hospital,

46:41.080 --> 46:42.241
you've barely been here.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.600
- How dare you.
- Claire, please.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.001
There are fine universities there.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.727
Oxford, for one,
where I still have some pull.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.762
And what about Candy?

46:55.840 --> 46:57.001
Sandy.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.888
We'll get married as soon as I'm free.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.004
You're going to marry her

47:04.840 --> 47:06.842
For God's sake, Frank. Be serious.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.165
I'm finished with this, Claire.

47:13.640 --> 47:14.880
You've been waiting.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.406
All this time,

47:19.640 --> 47:22.530
you've just been waiting
for the clock to run out.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.881
Well, Brianna is my daughter.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.290
And you will not take her anywhere.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.683
Yeah, well, I don't think I'll have to.

47:33.720 --> 47:37.884
- You bloody bastard!
- Be reasonable, Claire.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.161
You want to divorce me?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.001
Fine.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.200
Use whatever grounds you like
except adultery,

47:46.400 --> 47:49.210
which you can't prove
because it doesn't exist.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.041
If you try to take Brianna away from me,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.289
I will have a thing or two
to say about adultery, Frank.

47:58.360 --> 48:01.489
This isn't about you and me any more.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.450
Brianna is a grown woman.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.727
She can make her own decisions.
She has her own life.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.770
I would like to live
the rest of my life

48:11.360 --> 48:12.725
with a wife who truly loves me.

48:18.880 --> 48:22.441
You couldn't look at Brianna
without seeing him.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.641
Could you?

48:29.200 --> 48:30.964
Without that constant reminder.

48:35.720 --> 48:36.721
Him.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.409
Might you have forgotten him,

48:41.960 --> 48:43.086
with time?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.611
That amount of time

48:50.520 --> 48:51.931
doesn't exist.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.081
Dr Randall.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.761
Yes.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.570
Are they prepping for surgery

49:38.680 --> 49:40.364
Okay, I'll be right there.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.165
Prepare to march the men.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.683
The ships sail at nightfall.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.841
Fraser?

49:53.640 --> 49:55.881
To the right. Close your ranks.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.201
What's happening?

50:01.280 --> 50:02.361
Prison's closing.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.211
The prisoners are being removed.

50:04.280 --> 50:05.964
The fortress is to be garrisoned

50:06.040 --> 50:08.281
by the Queen's
seventh own regiment of dragoons.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.401
Removed?

50:10.240 --> 50:11.526
To the left.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.602
- To where?
- The colonies.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.761
Where...

50:15.840 --> 50:18.320
Quickly, now. The journey ahead is long.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.481
Where am I being taken?

50:29.560 --> 50:30.561
Grey?

50:31.360 --> 50:32.885
Keep your line!

50:35.520 --> 50:36.521
Grey?

51:13.840 --> 51:15.410
It's been three days.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.608
You're going to have
to talk to me eventually.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.169
It's no better than slavery.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.369
A term of indenture is not slavery.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.683
The other prisoners will regain
their freedom after a term of 14 years.

51:29.760 --> 51:30.966
If they survive.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.970
Why was I not sent to the territories
or the colonies with them?

51:41.360 --> 51:42.805
Why do you keep me here, Grey?

51:46.640 --> 51:48.688
You are not merely a prisoner,
but a convicted traitor,

51:48.760 --> 51:50.410
imprisoned at the pleasure
of His Majesty.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.766
Your sentence cannot be commuted
without royal approval.

51:54.480 --> 51:57.165
His Majesty has not seen fit
to give that approval.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.044
I couldn't give you freedom, Fraser.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.409
This is the next best I could manage.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.086
Where am I to go, then?

52:09.040 --> 52:11.964
It's called Helwater.
You'll serve Lord Dunsany.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.165
I shall visit you once each quarter,

52:17.080 --> 52:18.320
to ensure your welfare.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.609
- Welfare?
- But I caution you...

52:21.680 --> 52:24.923
Your new host is not well disposed
to Charles Stuart or his followers.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.802
You can scarcely hope to conceal
the fact that you're a Scot,

52:28.240 --> 52:29.366
a Highlander at that.

52:29.840 --> 52:32.320
If you will consider a piece
of well-meant advice,

52:32.400 --> 52:33.845
it might be judicious

52:34.680 --> 52:38.162
not to use a name
as easily recognised as your own.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.766
Why?

53:02.760 --> 53:04.205
Why would you do this for me?

53:09.280 --> 53:11.123
I didna let ye have yer way.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.362
I regret that particular
moment of weakness.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.046
It was foolish of me.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.326
But I told you about...

53:24.160 --> 53:25.685
someone I cared for.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.001
And you did the same.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.848
You gave me my life all those years ago.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.565
Now I give you yours.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.250
I hope you'll use it well.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.163
Yer brother discharged that debt.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.045
For the sake of the family name.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.643
I discharge it for the sake of my own.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.365
Now, Mr Fraser,

53:49.640 --> 53:50.846
let's be on our way.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.809
Frances is in recovery.

54:15.280 --> 54:18.045
She's stable and her vitals are good.

54:19.200 --> 54:23.842
The best thing you can do for her now
is get some rest.

54:32.600 --> 54:33.601
Thank you.

54:46.920 --> 54:47.921
It's Frank.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.325
There's been a car accident.

55:46.840 --> 55:48.251
Frank.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.407
If you're still close enough
to hear me...

56:26.800 --> 56:28.211
I did love you.

56:32.560 --> 56:33.846
Very much.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.569
You were my first love.
