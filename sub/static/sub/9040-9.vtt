WEBVTT

00:03.333 --> 00:04.800
- SO YOU'RE STUCK
WITH DEBRA'S PARENTS

00:04.800 --> 00:07.333
FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

00:07.333 --> 00:09.033
- WELL, WE HARDLY
GET TO SEE THEM,

00:09.033 --> 00:10.567
SO WHEN THEY
COME TO TOWN,

00:10.567 --> 00:13.367
WE WANT TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME
AS POSSIBLE WITH THEM.

00:20.567 --> 00:23.567
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.200
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT DEBRA'S MOM.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.567
SHE GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

00:31.567 --> 00:34.900
- WHAT ABOUT THE HUSBAND?
HE'S THE WEIRD ONE.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.433
HE GOT ALL THAT LOTION
ON HIM.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.067
HE'S ALL
SLICK AND MOIST,

00:39.067 --> 00:42.667
LIKE A BEAVER
RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.067
[doorbell rings]

00:44.067 --> 00:45.467
- RAY,
COULD YOU GET THAT?

00:45.467 --> 00:48.033
- COME IN!

00:48.033 --> 00:49.767

00:57.833 --> 01:00.233
- HEY, THERE, UH,

01:00.233 --> 01:03.167

RAYMOND. WAH!

01:03.167 --> 01:05.533

01:08.367 --> 01:10.367
- MM-HMM. IN RECORD TIME.
- YEAH?

01:10.367 --> 01:12.900
YOUR MOTHER KEPT
AN EAGLE EYE OUT FOR SMOKIES.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.267
- AH. [laughs]

01:14.267 --> 01:15.467

01:20.033 --> 01:21.500
CONNECTICUT GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA

01:21.500 --> 01:24.667
AND REGULAR GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.800
WHO WANTS TOOTSIE POPS?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.700

[laughs]

01:36.667 --> 01:38.100
[kissing]

01:38.100 --> 01:39.333
- HI, MARIE.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.700
- MARIE,
YOU'RE LOOKING WONDERFUL!

01:42.700 --> 01:45.067
- [laughs] OH, I JUST THINK
I LOOK A WRECK.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.800
I'VE BEEN
HELPING DEBRA COOK.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.733
- I'LL GET THE REST.
- OH, AND, ROBERT,

01:53.567 --> 01:55.700
HOW NICE
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.733
OH.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.433

HE'S--

02:19.433 --> 02:22.567
HE'S--HE'S, UH,
PASSING A STONE.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.933
- COULD YOU GET UP, FRANK?
AND WOULD YOU GIVE ME THOSE?

02:25.933 --> 02:27.633
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.600
- PANTS, DAD.
PANTS, PANTS.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.533
- OH.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.867
- YOU WANT THEM UP OR DOWN?
WHAT KIND OF PARTY IS THIS?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.400
[laughter]

02:41.400 --> 02:44.033
- YOU CAN NEVER COMPLAIN
ABOUT MY PARENTS AGAIN EVER.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.700
I MEAN IT.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.500
- OKAY, WELL,
THIS IS ALL OF IT.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.967
- WHOO, YOU GOT THAT?
- YEAH.

02:48.967 --> 02:51.233
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.633
HOW LONG ARE YOUR RELATIVES
STAYING, DEAR?

02:53.633 --> 02:55.367
- WELL, WE HARDLY GET TO SEE 'EM
WHEN THEY COME TO TOWN,

02:55.367 --> 02:58.667
WE WANT TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME
AS POSSIBLE WITH THEM.

03:01.467 --> 03:05.600
- THIS IS FOR OUR TRIP
TO BADEN-BADEN IN GERMANY.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.900
- IT'S IN
THE SCHWARZWALD,

03:07.900 --> 03:10.467
RIGHT ON THE BANKS
OF THE OOSBACH.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.867
- OOSBACH? YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES

03:12.867 --> 03:15.400
WITH FUNNY-SOUNDING NAMES
RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.800
- THAT'S ENOUGH,
FRANK.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.867
- MILWAUKEE.
- DAD.

03:18.867 --> 03:21.233
- LAKE TAHOE.

03:21.233 --> 03:22.967
- WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

03:22.967 --> 03:26.700
- TAHOE.
- [chuckles]

03:26.700 --> 03:31.033
- ACTUALLY, BADEN-BADEN
HAS THE MOST AMAZING SPA.

03:31.033 --> 03:33.833
- IT IS AMAZING,
OR AS THEY SAY,

03:33.833 --> 03:36.267
ERSTAUNLICH.

03:36.267 --> 03:40.200
- I GOT SPIT
ALL OVER ME HERE.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.533
[buzzer]
- OOH, MY YAMS.

03:42.533 --> 03:43.933
- PLENTY OF MARSHMALLOWS,
RIGHT, MARIE?

03:43.933 --> 03:45.500
- OF COURSE.
- BECAUSE

03:45.500 --> 03:47.767
WITHOUT THE MARSHMALLOWS,
IT'S A DAMN VEGETABLE.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.267
- I KNOW, FRANK.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.167
- I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY YAMS, SO, RAY,

03:51.167 --> 03:52.833
COULD YOU SHOW
MY PARENTS UPSTAIRS, HON?

03:52.833 --> 03:56.400
- UH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST--IT'S UP THOSE STAIRS.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.267
- TAKE THEM
UP TO THE ROOM, RAY!

03:58.267 --> 04:00.633
- AH. WE HARDLY GET TO SEE YOU.
WHEN YOU COME,

04:00.633 --> 04:03.067
WE WANT TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME
AS POSSIBLE WITH YOU.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.567
- IT'S SO NICE OF YOU

04:06.567 --> 04:07.600
- CAPE COD.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.567
- OKAY. DAD--DAD,
WE GET IT.

04:12.533 --> 04:16.333
- I LIKE
THE "COD" PART. [laughs]

04:18.067 --> 04:24.300
- SO THIS IS IT.
THE BEDROOM.

04:24.300 --> 04:28.600
- YOU MEAN,
DAS SHLAUFZIMMER.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.467
- YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

04:31.467 --> 04:32.700
- IT'S SO NICE OF YOU

04:32.700 --> 04:34.933
TO GIVE UP YOUR ROOM
FOR US, RAYMOND.

04:34.933 --> 04:37.133
I HOPE WE'RE NOT
PUTTING YOU OUT.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.867
- NO, NO, NO,
EXCEPT FOR THE PART

04:38.867 --> 04:40.100
WHERE I GOT TO GET OUT.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.667
[laughter]

04:43.667 --> 04:45.100
OKAY.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.533
UH, I'LL JUST GET
MY JAMMIES.

04:48.533 --> 04:51.967
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BEST THING
TO SLEEP IN?

04:51.967 --> 04:54.433
- A HOTEL?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.767
- NOTHING.
AU NATUREL.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.967
IT REALLY GIVES THE BODY
A SENSE OF FREEDOM, HUH, HONEY?

05:02.967 --> 05:05.500
- OH, LET FREEDOM RING.
HA HA.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.367
- OH, YEAH,
THIS IS WUNDERBAR.

05:11.367 --> 05:15.967
- AH.
NICE FIRM MATTRESS, HUH?

05:15.967 --> 05:19.233
- YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.733
OH, THIS WILL BE GREAT
FOR MY HIP.

05:38.933 --> 05:41.667
- MY PILLOW.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.600
DEBRA.

05:58.967 --> 06:02.100
DEBRA.
- WHAT?

06:03.567 --> 06:07.367
- DOES YOUR FATHER SHOWER
BEFORE HE GOES TO BED?

06:09.033 --> 06:11.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:12.467 --> 06:16.967
- WE HAVE TO GET
A NEW BED.

06:16.967 --> 06:19.500
- WOULD YOU JUST
GO TO SLEEP?

06:19.500 --> 06:21.033
MY GOODNESS,
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY

06:21.033 --> 06:24.767
TO HAVE SOME NORMAL PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE FOR A CHANGE.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.100
- HEY, SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT MY FATHER,

06:29.100 --> 06:33.400
HE'S NEVER BEEN NAKED
IN OUR BED.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.600
EXCEPT FOR
THAT ONE SUPER BOWL.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.267
- YOU TOLD ME
HE WAS WEARING UNDERWEAR.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.733
- JUST SOCKS.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.533
- WE GOT TO GET
A NEW BED.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.100
- [grunts]

06:54.100 --> 06:55.633
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:55.633 --> 06:58.700
- THIRSTY.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.667
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LISTEN
REAL CAREFUL,

07:02.667 --> 07:06.000
YOU CAN HEAR
MY PILLOW SCREAMING.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.733
- EVERYBODY'S GETTING NAKED
IN MY BED EXCEPT ME.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.933
- I AM GETTING
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

07:25.933 --> 07:27.333
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO
DO THE HOMEWORK.

07:27.333 --> 07:31.200
- I WAS DOING THE HOMEWORK,
COMMANDANT.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.600
- NO, YOU WEREN'T
DOING IT RIGHT.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.333
THE BINDER SAYS TO LIST

07:35.333 --> 07:38.167
OUR PARTNER'S POSITIVE
QUALITIES WITH EXAMPLES.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.800
NOW, HAVE YOU
DONE ANY OF THE--

07:39.800 --> 07:41.333
- FINE.

07:41.333 --> 07:46.267
"WARREN IS VERY, VERY GOOD
AT BEING CONTROLLING."

07:46.267 --> 07:47.900
- "CONTROLLING"
HAS TWO "L"s.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.100
LET ME SEE
WHAT ELSE YOU WROTE.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.800
- GET AWAY FROM ME.
- LOIS,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.233
SHOW ME
WHAT YOU WROTE.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.000
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK
RIDICULOUS THIS WEEK.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.367
- THAT'S RIGHT. ALL YOU
CARE ABOUT IS HOW YOU LOOK.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.567
WELL, I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO GO TO THIS THING.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.433
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO
TO BADEN-BADEN

08:01.433 --> 08:04.067
LIKE WE TOLD
EVERYBODY?

08:11.867 --> 08:14.067
WELL, MAYBE IT'S WHAT
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.533
- [spitting]

08:15.533 --> 08:18.600
- THIS THING IS GOING TO BE
A WASTE OF TIME.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.767
- YOU ARE
SO DAMNED NEGATIVE.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.267
YOU DON'T THINK
WE NEED A LITTLE HELP?

08:23.267 --> 08:24.733
HOW ABOUT THE SEX?
WHAT ABOUT THE SEX?

08:24.733 --> 08:27.467
- I AM NOT WITHHOLDING SEX
FROM YOU. I AM TIRED.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.467
CAN'T I EVER BE TIRED?
IS THAT ALLOWED?

08:32.300 --> 08:34.633
- WELL,
I'M NEVER TOO TIRED.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.333
PUT THAT ON THE LIST.
THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.133
- OH, YES,
YOU'D LIKE

08:39.133 --> 08:41.000
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
- WHAT?
ALL OF A SUDDEN

08:42.600 --> 08:45.900
DISCUSSING OUR SEX LIFE
IS VERBOTEN?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.867
- UGH. THAT FACE.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.067
- WHAT FACE?

08:49.067 --> 08:50.333
- YOUR LANGUAGE FACE.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.700
"VERBOTEN,
OOSBACH."

08:56.933 --> 08:58.133
- I NEVER MAKE THAT FACE.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.667
- YOU HAVE A FACE
FOR EVERYTHING.

08:59.667 --> 09:03.800
HERE IS YOUR
"HOW IS MY HAIR?" FACE.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.100
OH, AND MY FAVORITE,

09:05.100 --> 09:08.433
"WE'RE OUT OF VERMOUTH?"

09:11.733 --> 09:13.633
- I NEED THE VERMOUTH

09:13.633 --> 09:16.000
TO PUT UP
WITH YOUR PHONINESS.

09:19.633 --> 09:23.000
"OH, WE'RE OFF
TO BADEN-BADEN.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.533
OH, ROBERT, HOW WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU AGAIN."

09:28.533 --> 09:31.133
[kissing]

09:31.133 --> 09:33.133
COME ON, YOU KNOW
THE GUY FREAKS YOU OUT.

09:33.133 --> 09:36.033
- YOU ARE
EXACTLY THE SAME,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.533
AND THESE
ARE NOT THE PEOPLE

09:37.533 --> 09:39.700
TO TELL THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.433
- LOIS, IT'S ONLY
FOR A WEEK.

09:41.433 --> 09:44.867
- OH, YES, ONLY A WEEK
OF MARRIAGE COUNSELING

09:44.867 --> 09:46.367
IN NEW JERSEY.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.300
IT'S LIKE GETTING SHOT
AND THEN HUNG.

09:51.733 --> 09:54.267
- HANGED.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.067
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:02.233 --> 11:03.700
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
LAST NIGHT?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.633
DID YOU GO OVER
TO YOUR PARENTS' TO SLEEP?

11:10.067 --> 11:11.333
- WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF THAT?

11:11.333 --> 11:12.900
NO, I SLEPT
IN THE DAMN GARAGE.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.300
- WHAT?
YOU SLEPT IN THE CAR?

11:19.333 --> 11:23.933
- NO,
I SLEPT ON THE SLED.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.833
- HONEY, WHY?

11:25.833 --> 11:27.233
- I WAS TRAPPED
DOWN THERE.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.500
YOUR PARENTS
WERE DOWN HERE YAPPING,

11:29.500 --> 11:33.267
AND I FELL ASLEEP,
WAITING FOR THEM TO GO UPSTAIRS.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.833
- WHAT, SO YOU WERE HIDING
FROM THEM?

11:35.833 --> 11:38.567
- THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT PERSONAL STUFF.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.267
- SO?

11:43.267 --> 11:46.733
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING?

11:48.133 --> 11:51.000
- "WHAT'S THAT SMELL
IN THE GARAGE?"

11:58.000 --> 12:00.200
- IT WAS ABOUT THEIR TRIP...

12:01.200 --> 12:03.333
THEIR FAKEY-FAKE TRIP...

12:05.233 --> 12:07.733
TO THAT FOREIGN PLACE.

12:07.733 --> 12:09.567
- WHAT, BADEN-BADEN?

12:09.567 --> 12:11.600
- MM, SEE?
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.067
THEY'RE NOT REALLY
GOING THERE.

12:17.067 --> 12:20.233
THEY'RE GOING
TO NEW JERSEY.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.767
- NEW JERSEY?

12:23.767 --> 12:26.800
- FOR A WEEK
WITH A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.167
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.667
- HUH.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.867
- "HUH?" THAT'S IT?

12:35.867 --> 12:37.433
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GONNA SAY?
"HUH"?

12:37.433 --> 12:39.633
COME ON, THIS IS
BIG DOINGS HERE, SISTER, HUH?

12:39.633 --> 12:42.200
SHE--HE HATES
THAT SHE'S A PHONY,

12:42.200 --> 12:46.000
AND SHE HATES
HIS "OOSBACH FACE."

12:46.000 --> 12:50.367
- YOU KNOW WHAT, RAY?
THAT--IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.600
AND MY PARENTS,
UNLIKE YOURS,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.033
DON'T FEEL THE NEED
TO INFLICT THEIR LIVES

12:55.033 --> 12:56.867
ON EVERYBODY ELSE.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.967
- OR MAYBE THEY'RE
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED

12:58.967 --> 13:02.600
BECAUSE, AS IT TURNS OUT,
THEY'RE NOT SO PERFECT.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.667
- YEAH, OR MAYBE
THEY'RE JUST TRYING

13:04.667 --> 13:06.533
TO WORK OUT THEIR PROBLEMS
BEFORE THEIR MARRIAGE

13:06.533 --> 13:08.733
DEGENERATES
INTO A SCREAMING MATCH

13:08.733 --> 13:10.300
LIKE YOUR PARENTS'.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.433
ARGUING ABOUT HOW DEEP
A PAN IS BEFORE IT'S A POT.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.600
[as Frank] "IF IT'S
3 INCHES, IT'S A POT.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.200
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT,
MARIE."

13:17.200 --> 13:18.600
[as Marie] "IF YOU CAN'T
BOIL AN EGG IN IT,

13:18.600 --> 13:21.467
IT'S NOT A POT,
YOU JACKASS."

13:26.667 --> 13:28.100
- HEY, EITHER WAY,

13:28.100 --> 13:29.767
YOUR PERFECT LITTLE
CONNECTICUT,

13:29.767 --> 13:31.800
"OH, OH, MAKE SURE
YOU CUT THE CRUST

13:31.800 --> 13:36.033
OFF MY CUCUMBER SANDWICH"
PARENTS ARE FRAUDS.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.300
- YOU LISTEN.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.267
IF MY PARENTS
LIT AN ORPHANAGE ON FIRE

13:40.267 --> 13:41.633
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

13:41.633 --> 13:43.833
THEY WOULDN'T BE AS BAD
AS YOUR PARENTS!

13:43.833 --> 13:45.167
HUH?
- YEAH.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.267
OH!

13:47.267 --> 13:49.733
DROPPED THE TURKEY.
DROPPED THE--

14:29.533 --> 14:32.667
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHERE THE FLAVOR CAME FROM.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.033
- OOH, NO RUNNING
ON THANKSGIVING.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.067
- WHERE AM I SITTING
TODAY, DEB?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.767
- UH, BETWEEN MY MOM
AND YOUR MOM.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.300
- GOT ANY HARD CIDER?

14:59.600 --> 15:03.367
- OH, THE PARADE IS ON.
I LOVE THE PARADE.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

15:07.467 --> 15:09.033
- YOU--YOU TURNED OFF
THE PARADE

15:09.033 --> 15:10.867
JUST 'CAUSE I SAID
I LOVED IT?

15:10.867 --> 15:13.867
- THAT WAS
A COINCIDENCE.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.400
- CHANGE IT BACK.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.167
- NO.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.133
- I'M SCRAPING THE MARSHMALLOWS
OFF THE YAMS.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.267
- YOUR PARENTS
ARE A TREASURE.

15:25.267 --> 15:28.067
- HEY, HEY, HAPPY TURKEY DAY,
YOU IN-LAWS.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.500
- HEY THERE.
- YES, RAYMOND, THANKS AGAIN

15:30.500 --> 15:32.300
FOR THE LOVELY
ACCOMMODATIONS.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.167
- THE COZIEST B & B
ON LONG ISLAND.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.467
- [laughs]

15:35.467 --> 15:37.300
- THINK IT'LL BE AS COZY
OVER IN EUROPE?

15:37.300 --> 15:38.500
- OH, I DOUBT IT.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.100
- [chuckles]
SO DO I. YEAH.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.233
- SO WHERE YOU KEEPING
THE LIBATIONS LOCKED UP?

15:45.233 --> 15:47.233
IT'S GOT TO BE AFTER 5:00
SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.233
- [laughs]
- I'M WITH YOU, WARREN.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.733
LET'S GET SNOCKERED.
- [laughs]

15:53.167 --> 15:55.167
- UH, DEBRA,
LET ME HELP YOU.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.133
- OH, THANKS, MOM.
YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.400
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.800
- YEAH,
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.033
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

16:02.033 --> 16:03.300
- OH, YEAH?
- MM.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.500
- I BET YOU'RE REAL EXCITED

16:04.500 --> 16:07.067
ABOUT YOUR TRIP
TO HAAGEN-DAAGEN.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.300
- RAY...

16:10.300 --> 16:12.200
- WHAT?
I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.600
I CAN'T TALK
TO MY WIFE'S MOTHER?

16:14.600 --> 16:18.167
- PUMPKIN, CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN AN APERITIF?

16:18.167 --> 16:20.133
- OH, THAT WOULD BE
LOVELY.

16:20.133 --> 16:24.000
- HEY, MARIE, BEER!

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
- GET IT YOURSELF.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.267
- HERE YOU ARE,
MEINE LIEBCHEN.

16:28.267 --> 16:31.033
- OH, THANK YOU,
DARLING. MWA.

16:32.467 --> 16:35.033
OH, JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.
WUNDERBAR! [laughs]

16:35.033 --> 16:37.067
- MOM, MOM,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DEAR?

16:38.967 --> 16:41.967
- IT'S ENOUGH, OKAY?
I KNOW.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.667
- WHAT? WHAT'S ENOUGH?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? WHAT?

16:47.667 --> 16:50.267
- UH, NO--NOTHING, MARIE.
IT'S PRIVATE.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.533
- PRIVATE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PRIVATE?

16:52.533 --> 16:54.333
HEY--PRIVATE.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.800
- UH, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.667
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.633
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, MOM.
OKAY, LET'S ALL, UH, EAT.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.867
- OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA, DEBRA.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.333
EVERYTHING
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.967
- GOOD, OKAY, MOM, YOU SIT HERE.
DAD, YOU CAN SIT--

17:06.967 --> 17:08.433
- NO.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.333
- WHAT?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.867
- I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.633
- WARREN.
- NO,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.433
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO HIDE.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.000
I'M TIRED
OF THESE PRETENSIONS,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.633
AND I'M TIRED
OF THIS CHARADE.

17:21.633 --> 17:23.333
AS IT HAPPENS, UH,

17:23.333 --> 17:25.233
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BADEN-BADEN THIS WEEK.

17:25.233 --> 17:28.500
WE'RE GOING
TO PISCATAWAY.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.267
- HEY,
THAT'S FUNNY-SOUNDING.

17:34.033 --> 17:37.133
- LOIS AND I ARE GOING FOR
A WEEK OF MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.467
- [gasps]

17:40.100 --> 17:41.600
- WELL, IT'S NOT
A FULL WEEK.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.433
SO CAN'T WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

17:43.433 --> 17:45.167
- YEAH. [clears throat]
- ROBERT,

17:45.167 --> 17:48.467
HAS YOUR STONE PASSED?

17:54.967 --> 17:58.167
- I WILL NEVER
UNDERSTAND YOU.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.433
- I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S NOT HEALTHY

18:02.433 --> 18:05.233
TO GO ON PRETENDING
THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE

18:05.233 --> 18:06.767
WHEN IT ISN'T.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.500
- MA, YOU WANT TO
PUT THE TURKEY DOWN?

18:08.500 --> 18:10.567
- NO.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.633
- WHO ARE YOU
TO TALK ABOUT HEALTHY

18:13.633 --> 18:16.633
WITH YOUR
ANAL-RETENTIVE BEHAVIOR?

18:16.633 --> 18:18.100
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL EVERYONE

18:18.100 --> 18:19.833
ABOUT HOW YOU KEEP
YOUR LEFT SOCKS

18:19.833 --> 18:21.233
IN YOUR LEFT DRAWER

18:21.233 --> 18:24.133
AND YOUR RIGHT SOCKS
IN YOUR RIGHT DRAWER?

18:24.133 --> 18:26.600
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

18:35.900 --> 18:38.000
- MAYBE DR. SHEELY
WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY

18:38.000 --> 18:40.367
ABOUT ALL OF YOUR
PENT-UP HOSTILITY.

18:40.367 --> 18:42.600
- MY HOSTILITY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
YOU OUGHT TO SEE THIS WOMAN
IN TRAFFIC.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.833
CURSES LIKE A STEVEDORE.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.300
- WELL, IT'S NOT BECAUSE
OF THE TRAFFIC, WARREN.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.033
IT'S BECAUSE
OF YOUR INSANE WHISTLING.

18:51.033 --> 18:52.933
- THE WHISTLING
DROWNS OUT THE PROFANITY!

18:52.933 --> 18:56.400
- WELL, PUCKER UP, WARREN,
BECAUSE HERE IT COMES!

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
- OKAY, MOM, DAD,
PLEASE JUST CALM DOWN.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.300
- WHY DID YOU TELL DEBRA
ABOUT THIS?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.233
- I DIDN'T TELL DEBRA.
- THEN HOW DID SHE KNOW?

19:03.233 --> 19:06.467
- RAY HEARD YOU.
HE WAS HIDING IN THE GARAGE.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.533
- I WASN'T HIDING,
ALL RIGHT?

19:14.533 --> 19:17.200
I CHECKED THE OIL,
OKAY?

19:17.200 --> 19:20.533
AND IT'S A GOOD THING I DID,
BECAUSE WE'RE A QUART LOW.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
- WELL, WONDERFUL.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.367
NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.433
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY,
WARREN.

19:27.433 --> 19:31.633
- SWEET BASTARD,
I'M GETTING HAPPY. [laughs]

19:37.567 --> 19:39.233
- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

19:39.233 --> 19:42.467
- OH, HE IS
JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.433
- GO ON.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.400
- MO-MOM, ARE YOU--
- OH, IT'S--

19:47.400 --> 19:49.967
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
WE'RE TALKING.

19:49.967 --> 19:54.133
- I AM SO TIRED OF MY OPINION
COUNTING FOR NOTHING.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.733
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
HIS WAY.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.633
I'LL SWEAR,
EVER SINCE HE RETIRED,

19:58.633 --> 20:00.733
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M HIS WIFE ANYMORE.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.933
I'M HIS EMPLOYEE,

20:02.933 --> 20:06.200
AND IT'S ALL I CAN DO
TO KEEP FROM STRANGLING HIM.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.733
- I FEEL
SO CLOSE TO YOU.

20:19.600 --> 20:24.333
- DO YOU KNOW
HE MAKES ME IRON HIS JEANS?

20:24.333 --> 20:27.333
HE INSISTS
THAT THEY HAVE A CREASE.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.100
- AT LEAST
HE CAN WEAR JEANS.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.367
I MEAN, THE LAST TIME
I GOT A PAIR FOR FRANK,

20:32.367 --> 20:35.433
IT WAS FROM
THE MATERNITY JEANS.

20:35.433 --> 20:38.033
AND--AND I TOLD HIM
THEY WERE JUST STRETCHY.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.300
- [laughs]

20:47.067 --> 20:50.200
- OH, MY GOD.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.933
- HEY, YOUR PARENTS SEEM TO BE
DOING OKAY. IT'S NICE.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.933
- IT'S NOT NICE.

21:02.933 --> 21:06.400
MY FATHER JUST SAID,
"HOLY CRAP."

21:06.400 --> 21:08.867
- WHAT? YOU ALWAYS WANTED
OUR PARENTS TO GET ALONG.

21:08.867 --> 21:12.100
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T WANT
MY PARENTS TO CONVERT.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.400
LOOK AT 'EM.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MARIE.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.867
DEBRA COULD GET THIS RUG
A LOT CLEANER.

21:18.867 --> 21:21.000
- [mumbling]

21:21.000 --> 21:24.433
- OHH, FRANK,
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

21:24.433 --> 21:27.267
I OVERDID IT THIS YEAR.
AH.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.433
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED, PAL?

21:36.433 --> 21:39.433
A PAIR OF MY SPECIAL
STRETCHY PANTS.
