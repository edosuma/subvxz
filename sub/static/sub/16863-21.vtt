00:00.667 --> 00:02.169
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.211 --> 00:03.795
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. You looking for mike?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.380
No.
I'm looking for you.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.798
Turns out candy's got money.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.676
She's got an uncle that made a tidy
little bundle in the plumbing business.

00:09.711 --> 00:12.262
- Her take?About 250 large.
- Holy shit.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.765
No, she told me about
the money thursday night.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.142
You know, it was kind of like a test.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.102
One that ken passed with flying colors.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.791
Ma'am, you can't go- Come on!

00:20.826 --> 00:22.439
Get her the hell out of there!

00:22.981 --> 00:23.655
That was awesome.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.317
What the hell was in
that box the other night?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.777
Yeah, yeah. What was in
that box the other night?

00:26.812 --> 00:27.736
None of your business.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.322
I couldn't stop thinking about you, and

00:30.364 --> 00:34.117
I wasn't expecting any hanky panky at all.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.410
You still got to go.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.245
Ok.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.038
You're not a rock star.
You're a fireman.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.874
Yeah, for now, but kelly's
hooking us up with this a&r guy.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.543
And after we rock his world,

00:42.584 --> 00:45.587
he's going to sign
apache stone to his label.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.130
If I don't get back in the
ring soon, I swear to god,

00:47.172 --> 00:50.008
I'm going to yank some bum off the sidewalk
and beat him senseless. Come on, man.

00:50.043 --> 00:51.969
You might have a moral issue with this.

00:52.004 --> 00:53.512
Guy brought it to me last week.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.681
- It's a chick.
- A chick.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.892
I married jimmy because he wasn't like me.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.567
He was sweet.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.772
I mean, you know, he was really sweet
up until that time when he cheated on me.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.817
He had an affair, and I found out.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.903
Who'd you sleep with?

01:10.529 --> 01:12.531
Don't you worry about it.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.806
Did you sleep...

01:16.841 --> 01:19.294
with jimmy keefe?

01:19.329 --> 01:22.089
So what would be easier for you...

01:22.124 --> 01:26.211
if I slept with jimmy back in the
day before any of us got married,

01:26.246 --> 01:29.506
or if I slept with him a
few weeks before he died?

01:38.849 --> 01:41.059
Are you sure that's a woman?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.541
Compared to her, I think i might be a woman.

01:43.576 --> 01:45.981
Oh, good.
I thought I was the only one.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.025
You know, when her manager said
she put 2 guys in the hospital,

01:48.066 --> 01:50.444
I thought, you know, he was
just building up her rep.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.155
But after looking at her, it
ain't that hard to believe.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.615
She put 2 guys in the hospital?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.241
One was only there for a week.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.000
And what about the other one?

01:58.035 --> 02:01.288
Well, you know, he's-he's walking.
Again.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.831
- I'm not doing this.
- Hey, come on, franco.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.208
Come on.
We're preparing for this forever.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.918
Now, all of a sudden,
you're afraid to get in there

02:05.959 --> 02:08.711
and hit what we all think is a woman?

02:08.747 --> 02:11.044
I'm not afraid of hitting her.

02:11.079 --> 02:13.307
I'm afraid of her hitting me.

02:13.342 --> 02:17.888
Don't look now, but your nephew
is getting close to usurping franco

02:17.930 --> 02:21.058
as the 62 truck pussy hound.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.691
Tough luck for the kid, huh?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.526
Cozying up to a room full of pussies

02:24.561 --> 02:27.147
that would rather be licked
by a bitch than a hound.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.859
Great.
Next time, a little louder.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.612
- I'll be right back.
- Great.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.659
- Relax.
- I'M... relaxed.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.785
- Really?
- Yes.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.161
Ok.
Cool.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.830
It's like dike de soleil in here.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.543
You know, I never really realized
how many lesbians walk among us.

02:47.578 --> 02:49.968
I mean, the big, manly, no
makeup ones, you can see, sure.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.256
I mean, you can look them up on
google earth, see them from space.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.133
But the good-looking ones-who knew?

02:55.175 --> 02:58.512
Really makes me rethink all the
chicks I made out with in college.

02:58.547 --> 03:01.139
And then the ones right after college.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.766
And then that one a couple
of years ago in paris.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.017
But we were both on ecstasy at the time,

03:04.059 --> 03:06.061
so I don't think that
was really, like, a fully-

03:06.103 --> 03:07.104
- Ok.
- Lesbian-

03:07.145 --> 03:08.438
- I got it.
- You want to talk about the kid?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.024
Yeah.
I'd-talk about anything you want to.

03:11.059 --> 03:12.150
But let's start with the kid. Let's-

03:12.192 --> 03:13.986
I changed my mind...

03:14.027 --> 03:16.113
about you.
Us.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.449
And why would that be?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.578
I mean, it would probably be fun.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.790
You know, seriously, if the parts
fit right, it would be a cage match-

03:26.832 --> 03:29.960
you know, blood on the wall, sparks
flying, tons of crazy, angry sex,

03:29.995 --> 03:33.630
neighbors calling the cops,
endless rounds of make-up sex.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.889
But let's face it.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.677
Both of us are a little too old
for all of that. Well, you are.

03:38.712 --> 03:41.430
And if i was really being totally
honest with you about what-uh,

03:41.471 --> 03:42.890
- what's his name again?
- Damian?

03:42.931 --> 03:45.934
Right.
I'm here with him because he's easy.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.812
You know?10, 12
tequilas-actually 5, in his case-

03:48.854 --> 03:52.191
bullshitting, some small
talk about-about-shit.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.700
I don't even remember
what he yammers on about.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.864
I take him back to my place, we fool
around, and I send him on his way.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.158
It's easy.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.913
- It was the kiss, right?
- No.

04:05.948 --> 04:08.415
Look. I banged my head,

04:08.457 --> 04:10.083
number one, which I think i mentioned, ok?

04:10.118 --> 04:11.293
And then, you were looming over me.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.879
I don't have a problem with the
looming, but my head hurt, ok?

04:13.914 --> 04:16.255
So...

04:17.341 --> 04:20.469
let's-go ahead. 12 tequilas?
I can drink 12 tequilas.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.597
And we'll take some
ecstasy. Let's, you know-

04:23.632 --> 04:26.683
let's fly to paris and pretend I have tits.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.353
- I don't-
- It wasn't the kiss.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.563
What was it then?

04:31.605 --> 04:32.773
- It was the kiss.
- I figured.

04:32.808 --> 04:34.024
I'm kidding. It's me.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.365
I told you, I'm not into boyfriends,

04:35.400 --> 04:39.988
and you got big, bad boatload of boyfriend
written all over your david bowie face.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.033
Taking the easy way out.

04:43.075 --> 04:46.745
- Get your ice-cold beer here.
- Hey, thanks you.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.083
What's his name again?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.045
Cutie pie.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.549
Hey, let's go find a seat.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.764
All right.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.645
Come on, franco!

05:14.523 --> 05:16.441
What are you doing, franco?

05:23.407 --> 05:24.449
Come on!

05:24.491 --> 05:26.118
What are you doing, franc?

05:40.174 --> 05:43.635
I seen a lot of pussy in my day, asshole,

05:43.670 --> 05:46.930
but you are by far the biggest!

05:46.972 --> 05:49.725
Hey, relax, ladies.
Remember, you're all gentlemen.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.609
Oh, blow me, asshole.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.229
Well, whip it out, rupaul.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.195
Look, I got one!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa!

06:51.662 --> 06:54.706
You know, I think I'm kind
of over this boxing thing.

06:54.741 --> 06:57.251
It brings out the worst in people.

06:57.292 --> 07:01.505
I think I'm over this lesbo
thing for the same goddamn reason.

07:02.381 --> 07:06.176
Yeah. You want to, uh, I don't know,
maybe go grab a drink or something?

07:07.845 --> 07:10.973
Yeah, you're right.
Bad idea. Good fight.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.279
Hey, guys, negotiator's on his way.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.906
Copy that.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.784
All right.
Guys, let's go easy here. Easy.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.266
Hey!
Don't come any closer!

08:15.301 --> 08:17.706
Isn't this, like, a cop thing?

08:17.748 --> 08:19.333
You think I won't jump?

08:19.368 --> 08:20.626
I'm doing it!

08:20.667 --> 08:23.504
Yeah. Our new friend is
getting ready for his dismount.

08:23.539 --> 08:25.923
You got an eta on this negotiator?

08:26.715 --> 08:28.967
Don't come any closer?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.642
Negotiator's 10 away.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.679
Oh, my dear.
I hope we didn't wake him.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.890
He's coming from a job uptown.
They're doing the best they can.

08:35.926 --> 08:37.784
Well, it's not good enough.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.610
Get away from me, all of you!

08:39.645 --> 08:44.274
All right, look. One of us is going to have
to engage this guy in conversation. Tom?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.276
No. You don't want me talking to him.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.488
If it takes too long, i might end up
convincing him to pull a greg louganis,

08:49.530 --> 08:51.657
and the way my life's going,
I might be right on his heels.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.075
Back off, now!

08:53.116 --> 08:54.952
There's nothing you can do!

08:55.160 --> 08:56.870
I'll try.

08:56.905 --> 08:58.580
You sure?

08:58.622 --> 09:00.457
Wouldn't be the first time.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.085
What are you saying, you
talked down a jumper before?

09:04.294 --> 09:07.429
My brother, like 5 years ago.

09:07.464 --> 09:11.301
Got dumped by his girl and threatened
to jump off the roof of our building.

09:11.336 --> 09:14.721
Listen, just-just-just
talk to him, all right?

09:14.763 --> 09:15.681
Just keep him engaged.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.064
Just don't try to jump for him, all right?

09:17.099 --> 09:19.351
Don't do anything until
that negotiator gets here.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.270
- You got me?
- Yeah.

09:21.305 --> 09:22.980
I got your back.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.905
Brought you a jacket.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.533
I'm not cold.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.743
You're turning blue, bro.

09:36.778 --> 09:38.453
Who gives a shit?

09:38.495 --> 09:40.003
I got nothing now.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.958
Money, wife, my daughter.

09:42.993 --> 09:44.877
It's all gone.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.172
Come on, man.
Talk to me.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.777
What's your name?

09:49.812 --> 09:51.306
Leave me alone.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.886
What's your daughter's name?

09:55.304 --> 09:56.847
April.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.058
April.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.769
That's a nice name.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.273
So what happened?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.735
I got caught in a ponzi scheme.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.489
Lost it all- $11 million, my business.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.700
Why wouldn't she leave me?

10:16.742 --> 10:17.659
What do I have left to offer?

10:17.701 --> 10:20.204
- Well, I'm sure you've got a lot more-
- Who gives a shit?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.581
- Ok. I just thought-
- Who the hell are you, anyway?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.751
I'm shawn with the fdny.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.629
Shawn. You know what it's
like to lose everything?

10:28.664 --> 10:30.345
Everything, no. But

10:30.380 --> 10:34.301
I've lost things, people.

10:34.336 --> 10:35.844
A person.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.971
Nobody close.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.272
Yeah.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.392
Real close.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.396
Man. World's a crazy place right now.

10:46.431 --> 10:48.238
A lot of people hurting.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.943
Now, i don't blame you for
being where you are, but

10:50.984 --> 10:52.903
you got to think about your daughter.

10:52.945 --> 10:57.699
You know?I mean, you think it's
tough losing your money and your wife.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.203
How's april going to feel
when she loses her father?

11:01.245 --> 11:04.373
Everybody loses something
one time or another.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.960
It's how we overcome this
shit that makes us who we are.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.880
Jesus christ. What self-help
book did you pull that out of?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.592
I thought I just made it up, but

11:15.634 --> 11:18.303
I guess I saw it in a movie or something.

11:18.338 --> 11:20.764
- Jerry maguire.
- What?

11:20.806 --> 11:22.891
Jerry maguire.
You know, tom cruise, renee zellweger.

11:22.926 --> 11:24.852
I think that's where that quote was from.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.902
No, no.
No.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.564
- That's not from jerry maguire.
- That was a great movie.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.066
Yeah, it was a great movie.
But that was, you know,

11:31.108 --> 11:34.486
"show me the money" and "you complete
me," ok, not what you're talking about.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.321
- I hated that "you complete me" bullshit.
- Just a second.

11:36.356 --> 11:38.240
You're thinking of the
game plan with the rock,

11:38.282 --> 11:41.076
'cause I know you see all the rock movies
'cause you think you look like him, ok?

11:41.111 --> 11:42.911
- So that's-
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

11:42.953 --> 11:46.331
That jerry maguire, man, that
was all about the ladies, man.

11:46.366 --> 11:48.333
I mean, the chicks dug it, right?

11:49.418 --> 11:50.878
Damn straight.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.254
Yeah.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.089
Come on, man.

11:54.124 --> 11:55.848
Take the jacket.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.302
You're turning into papa smurf over there.

11:58.337 --> 12:00.637
Come on, man, take it.

12:01.638 --> 12:07.144
- Ok.
- All right. That's it.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.777
Thanks.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.522
You're welcome.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.650
So what's your name?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.694
Brad.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.532
- Oh, sh-oh- Shawn!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:20.574 --> 12:22.242
Tommy!

12:24.786 --> 12:26.330
- Tommy, get me!
- Come on!

12:26.365 --> 12:27.873
- Tommy!
- Come on!

12:31.460 --> 12:32.169
You all right?

12:32.211 --> 12:34.108
Yeah.

12:34.143 --> 12:36.006
Shit.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
Oh, shit.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.892
All right.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.854
Come on.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.064
- You see that?
- What?

13:34.106 --> 13:37.734
Right there, another jumper.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.403
No.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.406
- It's right there. Right there.
- No, no, no, man.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.617
You all right?

13:46.535 --> 13:49.204
My mind must be playing tricks on me.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.095
Look, man.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.674
Sorry about your brother, you know?

14:00.716 --> 14:02.759
I don't have a brother.

14:07.389 --> 14:11.894
Oh, man.
If at first you don't succeed...

14:14.354 --> 14:17.197
I talked him down.

14:17.232 --> 14:22.863
3 weeks later, he swallowed a
bottle of pills and finished the job.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.658
Looks like I'm zero for 2.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.205
Well, listen-

14:31.246 --> 14:34.500
Look, tommy, I don't want to
hear any speeches, all right?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.046
Look...

14:39.087 --> 14:40.756
Did you hear me?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.509
I don't want any goddamn speeches from you.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.011
She told me how you handle your shit.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.139
Jimmy keefe got killed,

14:49.181 --> 14:52.225
all them other brothers on 9/11,

14:52.260 --> 14:55.270
even when your son got run over,

14:55.312 --> 14:59.316
you did the exact same
thing each and eveyr time.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.068
Yeah.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.952
Yes, sir. You got yourself
good and shitfaced,

15:03.987 --> 15:08.867
jumped into bed with whatever piece of ass
happened to catch your crotch at the time.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.496
You know, that's what she
thinks I'm going to do to her.

15:15.249 --> 15:18.252
Goddamn, man.
No respect for the family.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.505
No thought about anybody but you.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.132
Now, that's all she knows, man.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.974
That's the damage you did to her.

15:26.009 --> 15:30.180
Now I got to deal with the shitstorm
that you put in colleen's head.

15:30.222 --> 15:33.225
Know what, man?
You're a goddamn asshole.

15:33.267 --> 15:38.438
A selfish, one-way, drunk-ass piece of shit.
You know that?

15:47.865 --> 15:50.659
What, man?

15:50.701 --> 15:51.869
Come on.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.912
See, that's what I'm talking about, tommy.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.956
That was my shit.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.552
You're right.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.932
Yep.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.692
Listen.

16:16.727 --> 16:20.230
Just don't-don't do what I did.
I mean, you know-

16:20.265 --> 16:23.490
drinking, do-you know, you're full of rage.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.278
That's not going to change anything.
That's not going to bring your brother back.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.655
You know what I mean?

16:28.697 --> 16:30.741
You want to change something?

16:31.283 --> 16:33.125
Go in the house.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.142
Go in the house and talk to colleen.

16:36.177 --> 16:39.089
Tell her, you know, you love her.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.169
Hug her. She doesn't hug
me anymore. I mean, I can-

16:42.204 --> 16:45.214
I can only get a hug out of
her if I buy her something.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.425
It's too late tonight.
All the stores are closed.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.013
Just go in there, give her a hug,

16:53.055 --> 16:54.806
tell her how much you love her,

16:54.848 --> 16:58.977
tell her how pretty her
eyes are, tell her how

16:59.019 --> 17:03.190
beautiful, sexy she is
in her new prada boots.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.069
She bought new boots?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.239
I bought her new boots
'cause I just didn't want to-

17:10.280 --> 17:14.284
make sure she was still on my side in case
the janet thing really goes south. But...

17:14.326 --> 17:18.288
Can things go any further
south for you and janet, man?

17:18.329 --> 17:22.416
Hey, kid. We're talking about marriage.
It's a bottomless well.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.003
True south doesn't exist
when it comes to marriage.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.635
What?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.475
Well, hey.

17:43.355 --> 17:48.861
That was some real father-son
type shit there, tommy.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.530
Yeah, well...

17:54.074 --> 17:57.035
Hey.
You know...

18:00.080 --> 18:02.875
This-the swaying shit's
kind of creeping me out, man.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.085
Come on, man, you know I love you.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.760
Yeah.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.567
You know, I think there
is a guy on that bridge.

18:08.602 --> 18:10.340
- Holy shit. Where?
- Aw, just kidding, man.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.134
Jesus christ.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.847
Get in there, man.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.809
All right?

18:26.523 --> 18:29.484
Seriously, man, I love you.

18:51.423 --> 18:55.886
Ok, ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up for the D.B.S.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.889
All right, guys, on 3.

18:58.924 --> 19:01.388
Together!Ready?
1, 2, 3.

19:01.423 --> 19:03.852
- Together!
- Together.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.522
Let's go.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.347
we're-we're apache stone.

19:33.382 --> 19:36.260
Uh-oh, yeah, right.
We're the D.B.S now.

19:36.295 --> 19:38.387
We changed the name.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.681
We used to be called apache stone,

19:40.722 --> 19:44.101
which I really dug, because
I actually have, like,

19:44.142 --> 19:47.604
2% native american running through my-

19:47.639 --> 19:51.066
Shut up and play something, dickwad.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.613
okay, uh...

19:56.655 --> 20:00.492
this song's called
synthetic cell phone. Self.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.619
Synthetic self.

20:06.290 --> 20:10.711
3, 4, 5.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.546
6.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.798
2, 3, 4.

20:38.155 --> 20:43.994
# Nothin' left to look at
but what lies inside me, #

20:44.036 --> 20:49.833
# my false reality cannot
take what lies ahead, #

20:49.875 --> 20:55.589
# clear the path of destination
is what you once said to me, #

20:55.631 --> 20:58.488
I- I wish the fresh time,

20:58.523 --> 21:01.345
# nothing left to spend #

21:01.386 --> 21:03.597
Boys, I don't know where to start.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.647
Fantastic.
It was fantastic.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.268
I see a lot of potential here, all right?

21:08.810 --> 21:10.938
You're all going to be rich and
famous in less than 12 months.

21:10.973 --> 21:13.065
- All right.
- Dude, that's awesome.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.233
Yeah.
What was your name again?

21:14.268 --> 21:15.192
Hey.
I'm mike.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.276
Yeah.
Just got to get rid of him.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell
you talking about?It's his band.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.280
Look, no.
I give your friend credit.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.908
He put together a talented
group of musicians here

21:22.943 --> 21:24.243
who are going to do just great

21:24.284 --> 21:28.038
standing behind this gorgeous 21-year-old
junkie from san diego I signed.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.254
Hey, listen, you little twerp.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.458
I'm detecting a little bit of tone here,

21:31.493 --> 21:32.793
and I'm not sure that I like it.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.170
- What tone are you picking up?
- That you don't like mike.

21:35.205 --> 21:35.796
Mike would be?

21:35.838 --> 21:37.089
Yeah.
Mike is him.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.882
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't like him.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.008
All right. Other guys,

21:40.050 --> 21:41.385
you can either stay with him

21:41.426 --> 21:44.346
or you can sign a deal
with the next big thing.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.598
Your choice.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.183
Well, I'm out.

21:48.809 --> 21:51.019
Yeah. See, I got into
this thing for one reason-

21:51.061 --> 21:52.020
pussy.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.356
But I've got more than enough
since being a firefighter,

21:54.398 --> 21:57.734
so I don't really need to be in a band
with a bunch of douchebags. No offense.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.736
All right.
What's it going to be, guys?

21:59.771 --> 22:01.411
We in business?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.991
You all get 20 grand as a
bonus as soon as you sign.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.368
- Really?I'm in.
- Me, too.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.995
- Let's do it.
- Wait-wait a second.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.162
Hold on.
Now, back up, all right?

22:09.197 --> 22:10.254
Let's just take a deep breath here.

22:10.289 --> 22:13.229
What this guy's telling you- come on.
They're just promises, words, maybes.

22:13.264 --> 22:16.170
Mike and I, we will give you more than
this guy could ever give you, right?

22:16.211 --> 22:18.297
Remember me?I'm the guy that
hooked you up with the routan.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.264
- Whoa. You got routan?
- Yeah.

22:20.299 --> 22:21.758
I've heard about that stuff. It's great.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.552
You got, like, pills, powder?

22:23.594 --> 22:26.847
Uh, no. It's a van.
It's a car.

22:26.882 --> 22:28.390
It's a V.W.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.142
Guys.
Come on.

22:30.184 --> 22:31.602
Look at this baby, huh?
See this?

22:31.643 --> 22:35.230
This is real, ok?You can
reach right out and touch it.

22:35.265 --> 22:38.817
This is mikey and me believing
in you guys, all right?

22:40.027 --> 22:42.070
- That's a V.W.
- Yes, it is.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.364
I got a buddy in jersey owns a dealership.

22:44.399 --> 22:46.950
You get me 3 of them, that color.

22:46.992 --> 22:47.784
What?

22:47.826 --> 22:49.786
You get me 3 of them in that color.

22:49.828 --> 22:50.752
3?

22:50.787 --> 22:54.708
Yeah. Need one for the city, one for my
place in the hamptons, one for the vineyard.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.338
You give him my card.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.846
You tell him to call me.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.653
Sweet, dude.
I just unloaded 3 routans.

23:02.688 --> 23:04.426
Sorry about that dumbass remark, man.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.636
Really, just heat of the moment.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.513
Don't worry.
Pleasure doing business with you.

23:08.055 --> 23:09.688
- Hey, buddy.
- What the hell, dude?

23:09.723 --> 23:11.391
This guy just shitcans me from my own band,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.226
and you're, like, best friends with him?

23:13.261 --> 23:15.020
No, dude. Come on. 3 routans. You know.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.396
Sorry.
Hey, fellas.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.898
Let's get out of here, huh?
Come on.

23:17.940 --> 23:18.989
Office is uptown.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.652
Get some drinks, grab a b-12 shot, you know,

23:21.687 --> 23:22.569
talk a little contracts.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.030
Come on. Let's go.
Now get out of here, you genius.

23:25.065 --> 23:26.949
Miga, ginger, show the boys a good time.

23:26.984 --> 23:28.826
There you go.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.416
Hey, I'm back.
You know, you left the door unlocked.

23:36.458 --> 23:40.212
It wasn't even closed all the way-

23:42.172 --> 23:44.299
ken?

23:44.341 --> 23:46.468
Kenny?

24:04.945 --> 24:06.363
- Hello.
- Hey.

24:06.398 --> 24:08.031
Hey.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.576
- It's me.
- That helps.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.078
Little more specific, please.

24:13.113 --> 24:14.878
Tommy.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.005
- Gavin?
- Yes.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.167
- The firefighter.
- Oh, jesus.

24:19.202 --> 24:21.295
- I'm kidding.
- What's up?

24:21.336 --> 24:24.006
Whoa.
Listen.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.425
I don't think you're
telling me the truth, ok?

24:26.466 --> 24:29.428
I don't have to tell you the truth.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.100
Hello?

24:36.977 --> 24:38.854
Tommy?

24:38.896 --> 24:40.689
Hello?

24:46.361 --> 24:47.988
Shit.

24:48.030 --> 24:50.616
Yeah. It's open.
Come in.

24:54.703 --> 24:58.499
I bribed the super 50 bucks
to cough up where you were.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.125
Want to tell me what the hell's going on?

25:00.167 --> 25:01.793
Why don't you go first?

25:01.835 --> 25:04.338
I go out of town 2 nights.
I come back-

25:04.379 --> 25:07.508
All right. You know what?
I'll go first. I'll go first, ok?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.968
All right.
3 things.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.311
Ok.
Number one-ahem.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.891
Probably not, in retrospect, a good
idea to get a joint bank account

25:15.933 --> 25:19.186
because, it turns out, I got
a little bit of residual anger

25:19.228 --> 25:21.730
left over from when you took all
my money a couple of years ago.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.315
So what I did was,

25:23.357 --> 25:25.609
i went out and I just bought
a whole bunch of stuff.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.194
I got a flatscreen tv.

25:27.236 --> 25:30.739
I got this beautiful massaging
recliner that's on its way over.

25:30.781 --> 25:33.116
And-oh!
I got this.

25:34.868 --> 25:37.120
Oj simpson's heisman trophy.

25:37.162 --> 25:39.248
I saw it on ebay, and I just had to have it.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.256
Of course, when it got here,

25:41.291 --> 25:43.836
I realized there was an
"s" missing from heisman,

25:43.877 --> 25:47.089
so really what I have is a heiman trophy.

25:47.130 --> 25:50.509
But it's still money well-spent in my book.

25:50.551 --> 25:51.892
You spent all my money.

25:51.927 --> 25:56.098
No, no. No. I, uh-I gave
some to charity, and, um-

25:56.139 --> 26:00.561
and, you know, the rest I'm keeping, the
amount that you stole from me, plus interest.

26:00.596 --> 26:01.770
You asshole.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.730
That money was left to me by my uncle.

26:03.765 --> 26:05.941
Yeah.
Uh, your uncle that died.

26:05.983 --> 26:09.034
- Yes.
- Which brings me to point number 2.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.697
In the future, you should
probably do a much better job

26:11.732 --> 26:13.705
at hiding any kind of
personal identification

26:13.740 --> 26:19.913
that has your real, actual
name on it, barbara callahan.

26:19.948 --> 26:23.083
You know, I never liked the name barbara.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.460
I had an aunt barbara.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.880
She used to fondle me
when I was a kid, which,

26:27.921 --> 26:29.590
don't get me wrong, i didn't mind, but

26:29.631 --> 26:32.029
she also used to make me eat my broccoli.

26:32.064 --> 26:34.428
That kind of killed the whole buzz for me.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.353
So, hide it, honey,

26:36.388 --> 26:39.474
because your husband could just
very easily jump on the internet

26:39.509 --> 26:42.394
and find out a whole bunch
of information on you,

26:42.436 --> 26:44.479
including the fact that

26:44.521 --> 26:46.780
your uncle is still very
much alive and living

26:46.815 --> 26:49.616
- outside of madison, wisconsin.
- My uncle is dead.

26:49.651 --> 26:53.488
Well, if that's the case, he's
an amazing conversationalist.

26:53.530 --> 26:57.284
And he sent me a picture of
you from about 10 years ago.

26:57.319 --> 27:00.085
And it's definitely you.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.956
A husband knows these things.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.418
And he also, um, ahem,

27:06.460 --> 27:10.380
told me to give you a heads-up that
there's a warrant for your arrest,

27:10.415 --> 27:12.306
um, from tampa, florida,

27:12.341 --> 27:14.968
probably the last guy that you ripped off

27:15.010 --> 27:17.679
to the tune of about 250,000 dol-

27:17.721 --> 27:19.264
isn't that the same amount of money

27:19.306 --> 27:21.642
that your dead uncle left you?

27:21.683 --> 27:22.726
Ok.
You want to know the truth?

27:22.768 --> 27:23.810
No.
You know what, honey?

27:23.852 --> 27:25.854
Forget about the truth.
You're no good at it. Just let it go.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.648
What happened in tampa- I'm innocent.

27:27.689 --> 27:31.276
Ok.
Which brings us to point number 3.

27:31.318 --> 27:34.279
I paid the super 100 bucks

27:34.321 --> 27:36.914
to give me a heads-up on when
you were on your way over here,

27:36.949 --> 27:40.077
and I'm looking out of my big, new,
magnificent, beautiful new windows,

27:40.118 --> 27:41.537
and I see you walking up into my building,

27:41.578 --> 27:43.330
and I call the cops, and I tell the cops

27:43.372 --> 27:46.917
that I have a fugitive from
justice in my apartment.

27:46.952 --> 27:47.876
So you know what?

27:47.918 --> 27:51.505
If you're innocent, please, sit
down and join me for a drink.

27:51.547 --> 27:55.905
But if you're not, I would
start running, mrs. Shea.

27:55.940 --> 28:00.264
You have just made the
biggest mistake of your life.

28:00.305 --> 28:04.434
So I'm leaving, but not
because the cops are coming.

28:04.476 --> 28:07.646
And you're going to be alone...

28:07.681 --> 28:10.816
and I hope you spend every second

28:10.858 --> 28:14.069
thinking about what you've just done.

28:19.950 --> 28:22.536
At least I still got my heiman.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.913
Intact.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.141
Kelly?

28:45.017 --> 28:49.688
I heard the television.
I know you're in there.

28:50.647 --> 28:53.115
I swear to god, kelly.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.943
I'll break this goddamn door down.

28:54.978 --> 28:57.279
Yeah.
I'd like to see that.

28:57.321 --> 29:00.365
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.951
All right.
Well...

29:02.993 --> 29:05.370
here I go.

29:06.705 --> 29:07.831
I'm going to do it.

29:07.866 --> 29:11.376
Ok.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.778
Jesus christ.
That goddamn door's made out of-

29:45.035 --> 29:47.204
Ok. Ok. Ok.

30:01.176 --> 30:02.267
- Get out.
- What?

30:02.302 --> 30:03.303
- Get out.
- Yeah, right.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.242
Yeah.

30:05.277 --> 30:07.140
Get out.

30:07.182 --> 30:10.227
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

30:10.262 --> 30:12.145
Get out.

30:14.982 --> 30:16.149
Get out.

30:16.184 --> 30:17.901
Ok.

30:19.945 --> 30:21.488
Ok.

30:23.699 --> 30:26.451
I'm not leaving, ok?

30:26.493 --> 30:28.377
Because you're lying.

30:28.412 --> 30:30.205
You're lying about that box,

30:30.240 --> 30:31.999
and you're lying about the-

30:32.040 --> 30:34.293
kissing, which is-taste- tasted good.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.669
But you can't bullshit a bullshitter.

30:35.704 --> 30:37.713
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

30:37.754 --> 30:38.839
No.
No.

30:38.881 --> 30:39.715
- Yes.
- No.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.175
Yes.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.010
You're going to tell me what's in this box.

30:43.051 --> 30:43.851
No, you're going to give me it.

30:43.886 --> 30:45.637
- What the hell are you so afraid of?
- Give me the box.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.973
- Last chance.
- It's my goddamn box.

30:48.015 --> 30:51.518
Tell me what's in the
box, or I open it myself.

31:19.755 --> 31:23.467
S- s-she's beautiful.

31:24.801 --> 31:29.223
She's dead.

31:33.602 --> 31:36.653
She was 4 months old...

31:36.688 --> 31:40.859
and one sunday, she woke up with a cough.

31:41.902 --> 31:45.030
And then, it got worse during
the day, so I called the doctor,

31:45.072 --> 31:49.409
and he thought she was just colicky,
but I thought-well, anyways...

31:49.451 --> 31:52.955
I brought her in that night, and, um...

31:54.498 --> 31:57.000
then her breathing started
to get bad, and then,

31:57.035 --> 31:59.749
they told me she had a heart defect,

31:59.784 --> 32:02.464
and then, on monday, she passed away...

32:06.260 --> 32:10.848
in my arms.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.189
She had such a sweet little face, you know,

32:19.224 --> 32:20.983
and when she went,

32:21.024 --> 32:24.194
her cheeks, they turned-

32:24.236 --> 32:26.530
gray.

32:27.030 --> 32:30.075
So suddenly, they-

32:30.117 --> 32:32.703
just gray.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.545
Uh, my son-ahem.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.966
It was kind of the same thing.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.302
We were-you know, we were on the-

32:48.343 --> 32:52.389
street outside the apartment.
He was riding his bike, and

32:52.431 --> 32:56.852
he was further down the
block, and after he got hit,

32:56.894 --> 33:02.274
uh-was a few seconds for me to run from
where I was to where he was, and in that-

33:02.316 --> 33:05.110
uh, amount of time...

33:05.145 --> 33:08.203
s- in my...

33:08.238 --> 33:11.915
gut was that he-he was gone
by the time i got there.

33:11.950 --> 33:16.622
But-I mean, my brain didn't want
to believe it, but I knew that, uh,

33:16.663 --> 33:20.751
you know
- as soon as I laid eyes on him, it was...

33:27.508 --> 33:29.968
Yeah.

33:31.512 --> 33:36.099
See, that's exactly what I don't need.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.395
I don't need to hear somebody else's story.

33:40.437 --> 33:43.440
I don't need anybody to understand.

33:43.475 --> 33:47.232
I don't need anything.

33:47.267 --> 33:50.989
I just need you to leave.

34:34.074 --> 34:37.286
You're not leaving.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.416
No.

35:00.976 --> 35:05.898
All right, guys.
One for everyone.

35:05.933 --> 35:07.708
Nice.

35:07.743 --> 35:09.484
Now-ahem.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.717
I have a few words I'd like to say.

35:13.752 --> 35:16.074
If I could just get all your attention.

35:16.116 --> 35:21.872
You know, you guys are the best bunch
of goddamn firemen I've ever worked with,

35:21.907 --> 35:24.850
and I know we just had a little
situation-a little setback-

35:24.885 --> 35:27.794
but we did the best that we
could, which is all we can do.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.380
And I'm going to tell you right
now, if that situation happened again

35:30.415 --> 35:34.183
5 minutes from now or 5 years
from now or 15 years from now,

35:34.218 --> 35:39.515
you're still a bunch of goddamn firemen i
would like behind, beside, and beyond me.

35:39.550 --> 35:44.144
- Thank you, tommy.
- Well-said.

35:44.186 --> 35:45.354
Bottoms up.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.272
More whiskey?

35:47.314 --> 35:48.941
Shit turns my stomach.

35:48.982 --> 35:49.983
Hey, don't worry about it, black shawn.

35:50.025 --> 35:52.653
We got a little something in the
back for you- peach-flavored vodka.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.328
Really?That's what I'm talking about.

35:54.363 --> 35:56.532
Well, then, what the hell we doing
drinking this shit?Bring it on.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.908
- Yeah!Yeah!
- Come on, man!

35:57.950 --> 35:59.493
All right.
All right!

35:59.535 --> 36:01.210
Unbelievable. Yeah.
I like peaches.

36:01.245 --> 36:02.955
You know what would be a great invention?

36:02.996 --> 36:05.833
Peaches that, when you bite into
them, the vodka's already in them.

36:05.874 --> 36:07.209
How can we get that going?

36:07.251 --> 36:12.130
Well, first off, we're going to
need an alcoholic with an orchard.

36:16.885 --> 36:18.804
Easy, honey.
Easy.

36:18.839 --> 36:21.313
Slow down.

36:21.348 --> 36:23.392
Shut up, queer bait.

36:23.433 --> 36:25.894
Goddamn, I love this woman.

36:25.936 --> 36:28.230
No one's in charge of me.
Right, tom?

36:28.272 --> 36:29.502
That is right, sweetheart.

36:29.537 --> 36:30.697
Yeah, but you know what?

36:30.732 --> 36:32.985
You might want to take it easy.
That's all he's saying.

36:33.735 --> 36:35.244
Really?

36:35.279 --> 36:39.783
Listen, why don't you go order up
another wife on the internet, asshole,

36:39.825 --> 36:43.370
ok?Because the one you got,
she kisses like a doorknob.

36:47.374 --> 36:48.876
Yeah.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.003
What the hell are you laughing at?

36:51.044 --> 36:54.089
That line, a wife on
the internet, tickled me.

36:54.131 --> 36:56.133
Yeah?How about you tickle my balls?

36:56.168 --> 36:57.885
One more drink.

37:01.805 --> 37:03.265
So, how's your cock?

37:04.099 --> 37:05.684
What color is it now?

37:05.726 --> 37:08.145
It's teal.

37:08.187 --> 37:09.938
Really?

37:09.980 --> 37:11.446
- You don't want to know.
- No, no.

37:11.481 --> 37:14.485
You can't say that your cock is
now teal-colored and not expect-

37:14.526 --> 37:16.069
All right. I used a bleaching agent, ok?

37:16.104 --> 37:17.821
It's supposed to lighten your skin,

37:17.863 --> 37:20.032
you know, how like michael
jackson did when he was black,

37:20.067 --> 37:21.950
and then he turned almost white.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.495
Well, you know, you do the math.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.922
What math?

37:28.957 --> 37:32.753
You're not supposed to use
it on your cock or your balls.

37:32.788 --> 37:33.921
Ok.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.923
What color are your-

37:36.632 --> 37:40.135
not going to ask...
what color your balls are. I-

37:40.170 --> 37:42.269
where's this faggoty-ass vodka at?

37:42.304 --> 37:43.764
Well, here's one bottle.
I think there's another

37:43.805 --> 37:46.350
case somewhere behind all that other shit.
I'll go get them started.

37:46.391 --> 37:48.936
- Ok.
- Uh, they're pink, by the way.

37:48.977 --> 37:52.314
My balls.
In case you were still wondering.

37:53.815 --> 37:56.360
They're supposed to be pink.

38:00.113 --> 38:01.865
Perfect.

38:03.325 --> 38:05.327
Jesus christ.

38:11.834 --> 38:14.378
You got nothing to say to me?

38:14.413 --> 38:16.463
No?

38:16.505 --> 38:18.257
Ok.

38:18.298 --> 38:21.642
Just wanted to drop by,
make sure you knew that-

38:21.677 --> 38:25.556
I wasn't lying to you when i told
you I wouldn't have slept with janet,

38:25.597 --> 38:27.898
you know, after 9/11.

38:27.933 --> 38:30.644
If you had died instead of me,

38:30.686 --> 38:32.917
I just wouldn'T.

38:32.952 --> 38:35.148
Especially since,

38:35.190 --> 38:39.444
well, seeing as how I'd already had her...

38:44.324 --> 38:46.160
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

38:46.201 --> 38:48.579
- You need a hand?
- No, no, no. No.

38:48.614 --> 38:51.081
- Hey, can-
- Nah. Busy.

39:01.550 --> 39:03.260
You guys drank all this shit already?

39:03.302 --> 39:05.596
- Mostly shawn.
- Where the hell did ellie go to?

39:05.637 --> 39:08.182
She went to pick up the dog at the kennel.

39:08.223 --> 39:10.309
You guys got a dog?

39:11.268 --> 39:13.854
Yes.
Yes, we do.

39:13.889 --> 39:16.123
Does it drink?

39:16.158 --> 39:18.358
I don't know.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.569
But I'm sure if it was
here and you were pouring,

39:20.611 --> 39:23.906
it would sure as hell start.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.574
Well, guys, listen.
I want to make a toast to tommy.

39:25.609 --> 39:27.659
Let me get you started, shawny.

39:27.701 --> 39:31.288
So, tommy, who's got us all back
on the road to liver failure.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.421
- Nice.
- Yeah.

39:32.456 --> 39:35.751
Yeah. We'll follow you anywhere, tom, as
long as you keep dishing out the booze.

39:35.786 --> 39:38.170
Oh, yeah?Well, you better
pack a couple of bags, guys,

39:38.212 --> 39:40.839
'cause it's going to be a long goddamn trip.

39:40.874 --> 39:42.007
All right.

39:42.049 --> 39:44.933
To tommy, greatest goddamn fireman,

39:44.968 --> 39:50.807
best goddamn father, best
goddamn father-in-law.
