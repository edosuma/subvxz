01:03.146 --> 01:06.297
MONEY TRAIN

02:30.386 --> 02:33.617
Merry Christmas.

02:43.066 --> 02:46.422
Watch it!

03:08.386 --> 03:11.662
Thank you very much.

03:23.346 --> 03:27.544
We wish you a Merry Christmas ...

03:33.546 --> 03:38.825
- Check this dude.
- He looks like the Five-0.

03:46.146 --> 03:49.138
Are you a cop?

03:49.306 --> 03:53.458
He's no Five-0. He's been drinking.

03:55.106 --> 03:58.701
He's checking out the D.

03:58.866 --> 04:05.942
We have two Hispanic males.
Let's see if they end the game.

04:07.786 --> 04:13.383
- This looks familiar.
- He's got a slice. Stay alert.

04:14.746 --> 04:18.261
He's got my ring.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.498
Shit! He's wearing my watch.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.978
Nobody go
until you see him pull his lapel.

04:28.746 --> 04:33.024
- Shit!
- Fucking white boy!

04:41.826 --> 04:43.817
Stay!

04:43.986 --> 04:46.500
Get out of my way!

04:49.066 --> 04:53.139
Move!

04:53.306 --> 04:58.175
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, grandma.

04:59.706 --> 05:05.338
- No laying down on the job!
- I'm glad my pain amuses you.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.736
Come on. Move!

05:09.066 --> 05:11.785
T.A.!

05:19.426 --> 05:24.295
Slow down.
You've got cops down there?

05:24.466 --> 05:31.542
All trains north and south of
Wall Street Station stop and stay.

05:42.666 --> 05:47.262
- Doesn't he ever sleep?
- Yeah, during the day. In a coffin.

05:47.426 --> 05:53.501
- You're stopping trains. Why?
- We've got cops in the tunnel.

05:53.666 --> 05:57.625
- Where is the revenue train?
- At Wall Street.

05:57.786 --> 06:02.257
- Send it through.
- We've got cops on the track.

06:02.426 --> 06:05.099
Nothing stops the money train.

06:27.466 --> 06:30.617
- The money train!
- I've got a new plan.

06:50.586 --> 06:53.180
Get out of my way!

06:58.906 --> 07:03.263
- Here's the cash.
- You sold a lot of tokens today.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.265
Watch it!

07:09.866 --> 07:13.654
- Freeze!
- They're not stopping.

07:26.186 --> 07:30.145
- I don't believe this shit!
- We're cops.

07:30.306 --> 07:34.379
- Back up, men.
- Look. it's the Transit Twins.

07:34.546 --> 07:39.495
- Did you have to shoot him?
- He's a fucking kid.

07:40.986 --> 07:46.344
- We're only following orders.
- Does he look like a train robber?

07:46.506 --> 07:49.339
Don't try to hang the blame on us.

07:49.506 --> 07:54.580
- You ran him down the track.
- What did you say?

07:54.746 --> 07:58.295
You're not gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

08:07.826 --> 08:10.659
Chief, the detectives are here.

08:13.906 --> 08:17.103
Sit down.

08:18.346 --> 08:23.818
- Don't bleed on my chair.
- No sir. Chief Patterson.

08:23.986 --> 08:30.016
That report says you're brothers.
You are a negro.

08:30.186 --> 08:33.735
He is white.
Is somebody trying to jack me off?

08:33.905 --> 08:39.299
- No. we're foster brothers.
- I ran away from this orphanage ...

08:39.466 --> 08:42.616
Shut up!

08:44.466 --> 08:51.895
Today, you caused my money train
to arrive 46 minutes late.

08:52.066 --> 08:57.663
When my train is late, I take it
as a personal sign of disrespect.

08:57.826 --> 09:03.583
The revenue collection of the entire
subway system is under my command.

09:03.746 --> 09:09.343
My train. My people. My money.

09:09.506 --> 09:15.581
No one dictates the movements
of that train without my permission.

09:15.746 --> 09:21.184
- Am I making myself clear?
- As a bell. sir. Your train.

09:23.786 --> 09:28.496
- Shut up!
- Yes. sir.

09:28.666 --> 09:31.260
Now ... any questions?

09:31.426 --> 09:36.784
Why did you send the train through
when you knew we were in the tunnel?

09:36.946 --> 09:41.224
Your situation last night
didn't affect me.

09:41.386 --> 09:45.061
Your men shot that kid to shit
over a rope chain.

09:45.226 --> 09:50.539
Yeah, they shot him to shit ... and
you can't buy publicity like that.

09:51.546 --> 09:54.663
That boy is a goddamn hero.

09:54.826 --> 09:59.456
Thanks to his sacrifice
the word went forth today:

09:59.626 --> 10:04.063
You fuck with my train
and I'll kill you!

10:04.226 --> 10:08.583
Now I'm gonna send one more message:
I don't like you.

10:08.746 --> 10:15.379
So don't fuck with my train again.
If you do, we will tangle ass ...

10:15.546 --> 10:18.856
... and you will lose.

10:20.306 --> 10:22.297
You're dismissed.

10:24.146 --> 10:29.345
I hate bastards like that.
You can't put a price on human life.

10:29.506 --> 10:35.024
- He's worried about his schedule.
- You know what I'd like to do?

10:35.186 --> 10:39.179
- Shoot him?
- No. I'd like to take his train.

10:39.346 --> 10:43.464
- Take the candy from the baby.
- You say the word.

10:43.626 --> 10:45.662
- Word.
- I'm there.

10:45.826 --> 10:49.136
- Let's do it.
- If I didn't have this badge ...

10:49.306 --> 10:52.776
- We're not nuns.
- We're not taking the train.

10:52.946 --> 10:55.983
Too late.

10:58.906 --> 11:05.459
- I sure miss the old neighbourhood.
- You should come back more often.

11:05.626 --> 11:09.904
- Are you coming in?
- No, I've got a date.

11:10.066 --> 11:16.096
With a girl ...
or a deck of cards?

11:16.266 --> 11:22.899
- Do you think I'm gambling again?
- Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.

11:23.066 --> 11:28.140
- You've got a suspicious mind.
- I know you.

11:28.306 --> 11:31.264
Have you got any cash?

11:31.426 --> 11:37.535
- I'm buying your Christmas present.
- With my money?

11:37.706 --> 11:41.335
Yeah, so don't be stingy.

11:41.506 --> 11:48.423
- You never cease to amaze me.
- Don't count it. I trust you.

11:48.586 --> 11:52.374
- Will you really buy me a present?
- I love you.

11:52.546 --> 11:56.221
- Then give me my money.
- Where's your Christmas spirit?

11:56.386 --> 11:59.981
In your pocket.

12:00.146 --> 12:03.695
No ties or cologne, all right?

12:05.146 --> 12:10.061
Remember where you are.
You'd better change that walk.

12:13.746 --> 12:16.658
Are you all right, man?

12:16.826 --> 12:16.906
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

12:16.906 --> 12:19.898
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

12:20.066 --> 12:23.945
See the grand
and kick it a grand.

12:24.106 --> 12:27.735
- Not me.
- I'm out.

12:28.106 --> 12:33.100
I'm gonna have to kick it to 5,000.

12:34.666 --> 12:38.295
Too rich for me.

12:46.066 --> 12:51.060
Charlie ...
are you gonna eat or play cards?

12:53.186 --> 12:57.543
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

12:59.546 --> 13:04.984
- I'll call you.
- With what? You're light.

13:05.146 --> 13:13.702
Gentlemen, say hello to Oyster.
Mother-of-pearl.

13:25.626 --> 13:29.062
Charlie, let me get you a parachute.

13:31.626 --> 13:35.539
Your brother better get here soon
or he'll be an only child.

13:47.946 --> 13:54.055
- Okay, nobody move.
- Is that you? My brother?

13:54.226 --> 14:00.256
- Thank God you're here!
- What the hell is going on here?

14:00.426 --> 14:05.705
- You brought the money, right?
- 300 bucks.

14:05.866 --> 14:10.257
- He owes Mr. Brown 15.000.
- 15.000?

14:10.426 --> 14:13.657
This is no time to be cheap.

14:15.466 --> 14:19.857
- Drop him.
- He's kidding.

14:20.026 --> 14:25.259
- They don't have a sense of humour.
- I'm tired of this shit.

14:25.426 --> 14:27.701
You're the man.

14:30.986 --> 14:36.265
Okay, let's make a deal.
Here's the 300 bucks.

14:36.426 --> 14:40.419
- The rest, you get in a few days.
- I'll pay you, I swear to God.

14:41.666 --> 14:44.624
Okay, reel him in.

14:44.786 --> 14:51.624
You guys are great. I was kidding
about the sense of humour thing.

14:53.626 --> 14:59.064
- I thought they were gonna drop me.
- You said you'd stopped this shit.

14:59.226 --> 15:06.462
- I thought I couldn't lose.
- You say the same thing every time.

15:06.626 --> 15:11.256
- I'm tired of saving your ass.
- I'd have got out of that shit.

15:11.426 --> 15:15.817
If I hadn't saved you,
you'd be a chalk outline right now.

15:15.986 --> 15:19.376
I have changed at a basic level.

15:19.546 --> 15:25.894
I was up there. 51 stories.
Dangling. Imminent death.

15:26.066 --> 15:30.662
Suddenly ... it was like
Buddha consciousness.

15:30.826 --> 15:32.817
I've read about it.

15:32.986 --> 15:38.344
God spoke to me. She said,
'You have got to stop gambling."

15:38.506 --> 15:42.419
- I bet $10 you can't do it.
- Make it $20.

15:42.586 --> 15:49.856
- Where's your sense of humour?
- You've been drinking dog piss.

15:50.026 --> 15:52.938
It's good for you.

16:01.866 --> 16:06.986
Let's see that drunk walk again.

16:13.946 --> 16:19.384
Say hello to Grace Santiago.
She's gonna be working with us.

16:19.546 --> 16:24.540
- Hi, guys. Nice to meet you.
- How are you doing?

16:24.706 --> 16:27.459
Welcome aboard.

16:29.626 --> 16:33.699
- She is smokin'.
- I think I'm in love.

16:53.346 --> 16:57.544
All quiet by the D.

17:08.866 --> 17:12.222
Okay, we've got a Christmas shopper.

17:12.386 --> 17:17.699
A white male. 19.
Dressed all black.

17:17.866 --> 17:20.141
He's interested.

17:21.866 --> 17:27.702
His girlfriend's after him.
She's dragging him away.

17:27.866 --> 17:33.145
- Did you do much decoy?
- Six months in the outer boroughs.

17:33.306 --> 17:36.821
This transfer
was definitely a lucky break.

17:36.986 --> 17:41.582
- They say you guys are the best.
- Modesty prevents me ...

17:41.746 --> 17:45.261
No. it doesn't. We are the best.

17:46.506 --> 17:52.615
His arm's swinging. He looks like
he forgot how to take a whiz.

17:52.786 --> 17:55.983
He got that from me.

18:00.146 --> 18:04.105
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

18:04.266 --> 18:09.294
- Are you living by yourself?
- Yeah.

18:09.466 --> 18:15.143
- Keep watching the D.
- We've got something going on.

18:16.186 --> 18:20.623
What have we got here?
Look at those big hands.

18:25.666 --> 18:30.023
- Let's take him home.
- I'm into it.

18:30.186 --> 18:34.179
Hey, honey,
we're gonna take you home.

18:34.346 --> 18:38.134
You want to come home?
You're a fine-looking man.

18:38.306 --> 18:41.935
- Don't fight us.
- Look at that face.

18:42.106 --> 18:44.461
We're gonna love you.

18:44.626 --> 18:50.417
- We're gonna chew you up.
- Come with us.

18:52.546 --> 18:55.504
Shouldn't we break it up?

18:59.906 --> 19:07.381
Hey! That's my man.
Get your hands off my man.

19:07.546 --> 19:13.496
- Do you want to get hurt?
- We didn't know he was your man.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.134
Get out of here!

19:19.586 --> 19:25.661
- I can't trust you for one minute.
- They were huge.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.457
She's beautiful.

19:30.466 --> 19:33.856
Wait right there.

19:36.666 --> 19:39.499
What are you looking at?

19:53.266 --> 19:55.257
Alone at last.

19:55.426 --> 19:59.419
- May I help you?
- We can help each other.

19:59.586 --> 20:03.374
- What do you want, sir?
- I want to ask you a question.

20:06.346 --> 20:10.544
Do you know what it's like
to smell your own flesh burning?

20:16.706 --> 20:22.019
Hand out the cash. bitch.
or I'll light you up.

20:31.946 --> 20:37.543
- I gave you the money.
- I'm not in it for the money.

20:44.746 --> 20:48.819
It's the torch! Call the EMS.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.745
I'll take the street.

21:23.146 --> 21:25.580
Get down!

21:31.466 --> 21:33.616
Sick bastard!

21:33.786 --> 21:35.981
Police!

21:36.146 --> 21:38.865
Get off me.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.701
It's okay.

22:08.026 --> 22:11.780
Johnny, Merry Christmas.
What are you drinking?

22:11.946 --> 22:17.384
The usual. Jack. Straight up.

22:22.986 --> 22:28.014
Give me to of those
and give me to beers.

22:35.826 --> 22:42.015
This is a little hard
so you should drink it with ...

22:43.546 --> 22:47.095
... a beer. Obviously ...

22:47.306 --> 22:50.025
... you've been there before.

22:50.186 --> 22:53.701
That's with me, Johnny.

22:56.266 --> 23:02.182
You took a pretty hard one today.
Too bad he got away.

23:02.346 --> 23:05.941
It was his lucky day.
That won't happen twice.

23:06.106 --> 23:12.978
The EMS people say the clerk
is going to be just fine.

23:13.146 --> 23:18.539
That's good to hear.

23:19.466 --> 23:26.941
This job can be hazardous to your
health if you take it too seriously.

23:27.106 --> 23:32.180
- I don't know no other way.
- Me neither.

23:33.426 --> 23:37.101
It takes a special kind of person
to do this job.

23:37.266 --> 23:41.305
- Someone with dedication.
- Perseverance.

23:41.466 --> 23:44.105
- Stamina.
- Strength.

23:44.266 --> 23:48.179
- Courage.
- Cojones.

23:50.106 --> 23:55.339
- Complete and utter stupidity.
- It's a curse.

23:59.426 --> 24:03.544
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

24:04.426 --> 24:09.500
- How are my to favourite people?
- We were fine.

24:09.666 --> 24:11.657
He's a kidder.

24:11.826 --> 24:18.345
I looked long and hard and I found
you something for your first day.

24:18.506 --> 24:21.862
- The alcohol preserves it.
- Thanks.

24:22.026 --> 24:26.895
He probably stole it
from a girl scout.

24:27.066 --> 24:30.103
Grab us a couple of cervezas.

24:30.266 --> 24:35.863
You don't expect Grace to pay,
and I'm having a cash-flow problem.

24:36.026 --> 24:40.099
You mean you're broke!

24:40.266 --> 24:45.135
You ain't got a dime to your name.
I love the flower.

24:45.306 --> 24:49.140
Great guy ... too bad he's gay.

24:49.306 --> 24:52.696
- How are you doing?
- Good. man.

24:52.866 --> 24:59.942
How does it feel
to be brothers with a white guy?

25:00.106 --> 25:04.622
I told you that story.
I heard a garbage can making noises.

25:04.786 --> 25:06.936
You found him?

25:07.106 --> 25:14.820
Did you feed him? You can't
get rid of them when you feed them.

25:14.986 --> 25:17.898
- Stay black.
- I ain't got no choice.

25:18.066 --> 25:22.264
- The night is young.
- I've got to go.

25:22.426 --> 25:27.659
- The night's a puppy.
- She's leaving.

25:35.546 --> 25:40.540
- I'm in love.
- You ain't got a shot.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.585
- I am deeply in love.
- She is nice.

25:44.746 --> 25:52.255
I'd introduce her to Ma Di
if she was still alive.

25:54.186 --> 25:59.499
You know what they say:
May the best man win.

25:59.666 --> 26:05.377
- I intend to.
- You're dreaming.

26:05.546 --> 26:08.663
You ain't even got a chance.

26:08.826 --> 26:14.458
She didn't even keep the rose
you gave her.

26:15.946 --> 26:17.937
That's fucked up!

26:19.106 --> 26:25.944
- You can buy her a new one.
- I wouldn't do that to you.

26:26.106 --> 26:30.861
It's typical of your insensitivity,
like pissing on that car.

26:31.026 --> 26:36.146
You've always got to be the coolest.
You've always got to be on top.

26:36.306 --> 26:41.221
- I'm just kidding.
- You're always that way.

26:41.386 --> 26:47.985
- Ma Di gave you everything.
- Ma Di treated us the same.

26:48.146 --> 26:52.059
No. She treated me great.

26:52.226 --> 26:56.777
She took me in. she loved me.
but she loved you better.

26:56.946 --> 27:03.294
We got the same thing, Charlie.
It's called sharing.

27:03.466 --> 27:10.497
- I get your coat, you get my shoes.
- I'm always in your shoes.

27:10.666 --> 27:13.942
I'm always Hook's little brother.

27:14.106 --> 27:22.741
- Is this about shoes or Grace?
- My ceiling is always your floor.

27:22.906 --> 27:27.661
- Then move out of the building.
- I like the building.

27:27.826 --> 27:32.581
But you're always first
and I'm always one step behind.

27:32.746 --> 27:38.025
- So now it's my fault?
- Yeah, partially.

27:38.186 --> 27:45.137
- It's you who always fucks it up.
- Now you're calling me a fuckup.

27:45.306 --> 27:51.984
- I didn't say that.
- It's the same fucking thing.

27:52.146 --> 27:56.025
- Are you listening to me?
- I don't need this shit.

27:56.186 --> 27:59.861
- Get your hands off me.
- Or what?

28:00.026 --> 28:04.497
- I'm here, you're there ...
- Make a move. man.

28:04.666 --> 28:08.056
You want to try me?

28:08.226 --> 28:10.820
Wallets, rings and watches.

28:10.986 --> 28:14.615
- Give up your shit.
- Are you deaf?

28:14.786 --> 28:20.338
- I'm talking to you.
- You heard the man.

28:25.986 --> 28:31.140
- Chill out, white boy.
- Now look at the shit we're in.

28:32.026 --> 28:35.382
- Are you gonna blame this on me?
- Definitely.

28:35.546 --> 28:39.858
Who was watching the street?
My back was to the street.

28:40.026 --> 28:43.655
- I'm sick of you.
- Stop pinning everything on me.

28:43.826 --> 28:46.101
Give it up!

28:46.266 --> 28:49.497
- You called me a fuckup.
- I did not!

28:49.666 --> 28:53.181
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

28:53.346 --> 28:56.861
I'm robbing your ass!
Give up your shit!

28:57.026 --> 29:00.018
I'll get you his shoes.

29:01.546 --> 29:03.343
I'll shoot you.

29:03.506 --> 29:05.781
This is a stick-up!

29:05.946 --> 29:09.018
I'll shoot you full of holes.

29:09.186 --> 29:12.735
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:12.906 --> 29:17.104
- You took my Ice Cream records.
- Ice Cube!

29:17.266 --> 29:19.826
They're sick!

29:27.306 --> 29:32.061
- Would you really shoot me?
- Hell. no.

29:32.226 --> 29:34.820
You had that Alabama look.

29:34.986 --> 29:39.537
You're lucky
I didn't have a fire hose.

29:39.706 --> 29:46.464
- You think this girl could be it?
- Yeah. I do.

29:46.626 --> 29:51.336
- Hey, go for it.
- Yeah?

29:51.506 --> 29:56.500
- I'm out of it.
- Are you serious?

29:56.666 --> 30:00.341
I hope she makes you happy.

30:01.346 --> 30:06.181
- Merry Christmas, man.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

30:20.266 --> 30:25.898
The department says we must have
backup in the Christmas season.

30:26.066 --> 30:29.342
Shut up and stay out of our way.

30:29.506 --> 30:33.784
We didn't ask for this assignment.

30:33.946 --> 30:37.222
We're not here to steal anything.

30:37.386 --> 30:42.744
They're pissed off because we
beat up their buddies on day shift.

30:43.866 --> 30:48.496
Everybody chill.
We're here to help you out.

30:48.666 --> 30:54.901
There's just a Little bit too much
testosterone in here.

30:55.066 --> 30:59.856
Back to your stations.
We've got a schedule to keep.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.415
Dooley ...

31:02.586 --> 31:07.262
- You gonna take in a lot tonight?
- Yeah. three or four million.

31:10.906 --> 31:16.936
- That's money.
- Stop drooling.

31:17.106 --> 31:22.464
Just taking a few mental notes.
Check out that grate.

31:24.906 --> 31:29.297
Look alive.
We've got something up ahead.

31:33.626 --> 31:36.424
Just tunnel workers.

31:36.586 --> 31:41.819
- You're in my place.
- Stop poking me with that thing.

31:41.986 --> 31:46.298
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop pushing me.

31:50.906 --> 31:55.104
You ain't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

32:03.306 --> 32:06.184
Beautiful!

32:08.306 --> 32:11.742
- Is she your wife?
- No. sir.

32:11.906 --> 32:15.785
- Your girlfriend?
- No. sir.

32:15.946 --> 32:21.384
Perhaps your sister?
That would make sense.

32:21.546 --> 32:24.140
A white brother. a black brother ...

32:24.306 --> 32:28.060
... and a Latino sister.

32:29.666 --> 32:35.423
- Officer Grace Santiago, sir.
- You boys are lucky.

32:35.586 --> 32:39.374
How did you get so lucky?

32:39.546 --> 32:44.779
Are they lucky, Officer Santiago?

32:44.946 --> 32:51.704
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Having you as a partner.

32:53.786 --> 32:59.702
- I'll try my best to do my job.
- I'm sure. You're dismissed.

33:01.066 --> 33:05.582
This doesn't concern you,
Officer Santiago.

33:06.346 --> 33:09.736
You boys, you don't listen.

33:10.626 --> 33:14.778
This time you may have your nuts
in a wringer.

33:14.946 --> 33:21.704
The first time my train
was only late, this time it's light.

33:21.866 --> 33:25.256
- Light?
- Sit down.

33:26.746 --> 33:33.265
It seems that in the darkness
somebody made off with $25,000.

33:33.426 --> 33:40.138
- How could that happen?
- Why ask us?

33:40.306 --> 33:43.582
You're a bad gambler.

33:43.746 --> 33:48.695
You're in debt up to your eyeballs.
You're good at losing money.

33:48.866 --> 33:54.498
- How do you think I lost mine?
- Do you think we're behind this?

33:54.666 --> 33:59.217
Did I say that?

33:59.386 --> 34:05.018
All I said was that bad things
seem to happen around you to.

34:05.186 --> 34:10.704
Some money got ... lost.
I think you can help me find it.

34:11.746 --> 34:15.455
- How so?
- You look for it.

34:15.626 --> 34:20.938
If you dig down in that commode
that you call a soul, -

34:21.106 --> 34:24.416
- you'll come up with something.

34:24.585 --> 34:28.737
- I didn't ask to be disturbed.
- You might want to hear this.

34:38.025 --> 34:40.141
Get out of here.

34:47.826 --> 34:50.056
You're dismissed.

34:50.226 --> 34:54.185
- Dismissed?
- Dismissed.

34:58.066 --> 35:03.504
One second you're calling us crooks,
the next we're just dismissed.

35:03.666 --> 35:10.139
The money has been recovered.
A collection agent confessed.

35:15.026 --> 35:19.861
What happened to that money train
model that was on your desk?

35:20.026 --> 35:24.463
Yeah. when I didn't see it.
I was heartbroken.

35:24.626 --> 35:29.575
- It's just gone.
- I bet it took ages to make.

35:29.746 --> 35:34.695
You're a wreck
looking for someplace to happen.

35:34.866 --> 35:39.257
I'll be there ...
and I'll fuck you dead.

35:40.386 --> 35:45.380
- Does he want to fuck us to death?
- When we're dead. he'll fuck us.

35:45.546 --> 35:49.698
Either way, it's a pain in the ass.

35:49.866 --> 35:54.986
Fuck him. Thinking I stole
the money. That's insulting.

35:55.146 --> 36:01.699
- I thought you stole it, too.
- You did?

36:01.866 --> 36:06.860
That's all right, you're family.
That son of a bitch ...

36:08.466 --> 36:11.219
What?

36:11.386 --> 36:14.344
- Look over there.
- It's Wollman Rink.

36:14.506 --> 36:19.978
Last night, those repair guys
came up a ladder into the park.

36:23.946 --> 36:28.622
I see what you're saying.
Stop the train near the rink.

36:28.786 --> 36:32.745
Use the ladder to climb up
and take away the cash.

36:32.906 --> 36:39.823
- We disappear into the park.
- It'll never work.

36:39.986 --> 36:44.264
How much do you think we can get?

36:44.426 --> 36:48.214
Three or four million. at least.

36:50.706 --> 36:57.179
- We could be rich.
- Free. And our people deserve it.

36:57.346 --> 37:01.942
- Say it loud.
- I'm black and I'm proud.

37:02.666 --> 37:06.978
We're talking
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous".

37:07.146 --> 37:12.061
- We could take cruise ships.
- Island to island.

37:12.226 --> 37:17.744
We'd be like boat people, but rich.
We could just buy an island.

37:17.906 --> 37:21.501
Now you're talking.
We could buy Mali.

37:21.666 --> 37:25.022
- Or Bali.
- Tahiti.

37:25.186 --> 37:32.217
We wouldn't have to put up
with any more crap from Patterson.

37:32.386 --> 37:36.220
- We don't deserve that.
- Let the sharks eat him.

37:36.386 --> 37:40.982
- Let's do it.
- Here's what I'm saying ...

37:41.146 --> 37:43.216
Talk to me.

37:43.386 --> 37:49.780
The best possible time
to pull this off is New Year's Eve.

37:49.946 --> 37:56.135
It'll be loaded with currency.
It'll just be fat!

37:56.306 --> 38:02.415
- Where did you learn that word?
- MTV Raps. It's my heritage.

38:02.586 --> 38:05.862
What do you think?

38:08.586 --> 38:11.737
Charlie. come back to earth.

38:11.906 --> 38:16.184
- Calm down.
- What are you talking about?

38:16.346 --> 38:20.783
- We're not going to rob the train.
- Why not?

38:20.946 --> 38:27.419
We're cops ... "Serve, protect,
break a mother's neck."

38:27.586 --> 38:31.704
- We can do this.
- No ...

38:33.226 --> 38:35.820
It would be no problem.

38:35.986 --> 38:40.184
I'm telling you. It's easy.

38:44.906 --> 38:48.945
Put that away before somebody thinks
you got it for Christmas.

39:16.226 --> 39:20.936
- Don't let me interrupt.
- It was too hot inside.

39:22.746 --> 39:26.216
So you're getting down. Salsa.

39:26.386 --> 39:34.782
I love this. I grew up with this.
I'm from the Bronx.

39:36.226 --> 39:39.662
Let's see what you've got.

39:43.826 --> 39:46.818
I'm very surprised.

39:47.346 --> 39:50.622
E Street.

39:50.786 --> 39:54.984
- See that?
- You're teaching me something now.

39:55.146 --> 39:58.343
You've got to learn from somebody.

39:59.746 --> 40:04.342
Watch out now.
I might throw a spin on you.

40:08.266 --> 40:13.659
- It's rough the first time.
- We need to get some practice in.

40:13.826 --> 40:16.704
- We were dancing.
- That was nice.

40:16.866 --> 40:22.463
- Don't just leave me hanging.
- Slow music? No ...

40:22.626 --> 40:27.256
- I don't dance to slow music.
- Don't you like slow music?

40:27.426 --> 40:32.216
How would it look for me
to step up to you like that ...

40:32.386 --> 40:37.699
... and start dancing with you close
and stuff like that?

40:37.866 --> 40:41.256
That could work.

40:46.266 --> 40:50.703
- I've got a confession to make?
- What's that?

40:50.866 --> 40:55.735
This is the first time
I ever danced with a cop.

40:55.906 --> 40:58.943
Me. too.

41:04.626 --> 41:09.461
- I hope that's your gun.
- Yeah, it's poking me, too.

41:09.626 --> 41:12.186
Maybe it's my gun.

41:12.346 --> 41:18.262
- Put your stuff in the back.
- Put your stuff in the back.

41:58.586 --> 42:02.579
I think I should go in.

42:02.746 --> 42:07.866
- We don't want people talking.
- We wouldn't want that.

42:08.026 --> 42:11.302
You know how the precinct is.

42:11.466 --> 42:14.139
You go ahead.

42:15.746 --> 42:18.897
Good night.

42:21.146 --> 42:24.024
Grace ...

42:24.186 --> 42:30.500
- I enjoyed dancing with you.
- I enjoyed it, too.

42:51.506 --> 42:56.580
How goes?

42:56.746 --> 42:59.863
A pina colada?

43:13.226 --> 43:17.014
You've got to get up
you've got to get up in the morning .

43:19.786 --> 43:23.904
I knew I shouldn't have told you
where I hide my keys.

43:24.066 --> 43:27.615
Get up. Time to play.

43:28.866 --> 43:33.223
Say no more, man.
It's hot in here.

43:33.386 --> 43:38.665
- It's like a sauna.
- Don't touch the window.

43:38.826 --> 43:41.818
- Fresh air.
- It's cold outside.

43:41.986 --> 43:45.979
- You've got to get fresh air.
- You're not in the Alps.

43:46.146 --> 43:51.743
- It's good for your lungs.
- Not in New York.

43:54.626 --> 44:00.781
You smell like you haven't been
back to your place to wash.

44:00.946 --> 44:04.256
- I've been out.
- Grace?

44:04.426 --> 44:09.216
I've been out with Grace all night,
and God, I'm feeling good.

44:17.026 --> 44:20.063
All night?

44:21.386 --> 44:24.696
All night, and I feel all right.

44:24.866 --> 44:28.415
Did you try some of your
cheap-ass moves?

44:28.586 --> 44:33.660
- A gentleman never tells.
- What?

44:33.826 --> 44:36.624
A gentleman never tells.

44:36.786 --> 44:44.579
Then you can go ahead and tell me.
How did it go?

44:46.746 --> 44:49.465
We ... I ain't gonna say.

44:50.946 --> 44:55.019
Did you kiss her?

44:58.306 --> 45:00.866
You kissed her.

45:36.506 --> 45:42.456
- Shouldn't you be home in bed?
- Too much energy.

45:43.546 --> 45:48.620
I thought
you worked that out last night.

45:51.306 --> 45:54.901
I've still got
a little something left.

45:59.266 --> 46:02.895
- You want to go at it?
- What? Boxing?

46:03.066 --> 46:07.423
Come on, let's go a few rounds.

46:07.586 --> 46:10.054
Don't hold back.

46:11.706 --> 46:14.778
Are you sure you want to do this?

46:19.906 --> 46:22.659
Sneaky!

46:22.826 --> 46:25.863
Get out of here.

46:26.506 --> 46:29.578
I ain't going nowhere.

46:38.826 --> 46:42.182
Okay ... good.

46:43.066 --> 46:48.777
- You want to talk about last night?
- You mean about you and Charlie?

46:48.946 --> 46:53.303
About you and me,
and the reason you backed off.

46:53.466 --> 46:56.902
Are you gonna box or talk?

47:01.306 --> 47:05.857
- It's Charlie. isn't it?
- Yes!

47:06.026 --> 47:11.259
- The guy's crazy about you.
- This has got to be a first.

47:11.426 --> 47:16.136
You care more about your brother
than you do about yourself.

47:16.346 --> 47:19.656
He is my brother.

47:19.826 --> 47:22.784
Yes. I care about him.

47:22.946 --> 47:25.540
I ain't no saint.

47:25.706 --> 47:29.381
There are times
I could kill the guy.

47:29.546 --> 47:33.061
- I heard he's kind of a fuckup.
- Fuckup?

47:37.346 --> 47:40.782
- I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

47:40.946 --> 47:44.700
- I was out of line.
- No.

47:44.866 --> 47:51.465
- I have to look after my brother.
- I understand about your brother.

47:51.626 --> 47:56.222
I don't understand what's going on
between you and me.

47:56.386 --> 47:59.105
You and me ...

47:59.546 --> 48:03.858
Yeah.
You and your feelings about me.

48:07.626 --> 48:10.538
Well, I decked you, didn't l?

48:21.546 --> 48:26.939
- I feel the same way about you.
- This could get painful.

48:27.986 --> 48:31.342
Hey, love hurts.

48:34.026 --> 48:36.494
Adios.

48:39.226 --> 48:42.263
Charlie, I want to talk to you.

48:44.066 --> 48:46.864
Come here. man.

48:47.266 --> 48:53.705
- I want to give you this.
- You got me a Christmas present.

48:59.506 --> 49:05.536
- What is this? 15 grand?
- I've been saving for a rainy day.

49:05.706 --> 49:10.461
- It's raining, Charlie.
- I can't take this.

49:10.626 --> 49:18.021
Take it. Handle your affairs.
Go ahead and pay Mr. Brown.

49:18.986 --> 49:23.264
- You're always there for me, Hook.
- You'd be there for me.

49:23.426 --> 49:28.625
No. I wouldn't. You wouldn't
get yourself into a mess like this.

49:32.826 --> 49:36.978
- I'll pay you back every dime.
- I know you will.

49:37.146 --> 49:39.057
I love you, man.

49:39.226 --> 49:43.504
- Handle it.
- I'll do it right now.

49:46.506 --> 49:50.135
I'd better put this shit away.

49:50.306 --> 49:56.097
Meet me tomorrow night.
I want to talk to you.

49:56.266 --> 49:59.941
You got it.

50:02.146 --> 50:07.015
You never cease to amaze me.
My best New Year's ever.

50:07.186 --> 50:11.304
Or something.

50:23.986 --> 50:27.456
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

50:27.626 --> 50:31.062
Easy does it.

50:42.106 --> 50:45.496
Thank you.

50:48.426 --> 50:49.745
Police!

50:49.906 --> 50:53.455
- Get off of me!
- Settle down.

50:55.266 --> 50:59.225
- Does this look familiar?
- That's my wallet.

50:59.386 --> 51:02.025
I see this all the time.

51:02.186 --> 51:07.624
The best place to keep
your valuables is right here ...

51:15.906 --> 51:20.696
No! Open the door!
Stop the train!

51:40.306 --> 51:43.343
Hi.

51:45.626 --> 51:49.016
Round to.

52:09.706 --> 52:14.063
I know you won't believe this,
but I had Mr. Brown's money.

52:14.226 --> 52:18.663
Some old lady dipped me.

52:18.826 --> 52:22.455
Dip this!

53:37.106 --> 53:40.337
God ...

54:51.666 --> 54:55.102
Charlie, at least let me explain ...

54:55.266 --> 55:01.262
There is nothing to explain.
I knew what was going on.

55:01.426 --> 55:05.624
- You're lying.
- If I'm lying, I'm flying.

55:05.786 --> 55:10.018
I'm happy for you guys.
Why wouldn't I be?

55:10.186 --> 55:14.020
We're brothers, right?

55:18.266 --> 55:21.576
Did you pay Mr. Brown?

55:21.746 --> 55:28.857
Actually, I lost the money,
but what else is new, right?

55:34.706 --> 55:37.061
Damn. Charlie!

55:52.146 --> 55:55.138
Two tokens, please.

56:04.786 --> 56:09.018
What are the chances of the robbers
actually hitting my booth?

56:09.186 --> 56:15.705
The report says it's only one guy
and that he goes for female clerks.

56:15.866 --> 56:19.575
So ... act female.

56:19.746 --> 56:23.580
What? Powder my nose?
Paint my toenails?

56:32.466 --> 56:37.062
Skip said you'd be a little late.

56:37.226 --> 56:42.141
- Are you all right?
- Yeah ... I'm fine.

56:43.586 --> 56:49.695
I was reading that book
you lent me. "The Kabbalian."

56:49.866 --> 56:54.781
It says that the universe
is a mental creation of the All.

56:54.946 --> 56:58.575
- You're drunk.
- No. I'm not drunk.

56:58.746 --> 57:04.025
- Your breath's about 90-proof.
- That's from last night.

57:04.186 --> 57:11.058
I don't want to hear it.
Go home and get some rest.

57:11.226 --> 57:15.219
You've got a lot of nerve
coming in here like this.

57:48.626 --> 57:53.939
- Let me explain about the money.
- What is it this time? Horses?

57:54.106 --> 57:59.464
No. I was on the train
and this old lady dipped me.

57:59.626 --> 58:04.222
- Don't lie to me!
- Have I ever lied to you?

58:04.386 --> 58:08.299
- Maybe about little things.
- A lie is a lie.

58:08.466 --> 58:14.701
- I want you to believe me.
- I don't. Don't say another word.

58:14.866 --> 58:18.336
Are you gonna hit me?

58:50.306 --> 58:57.257
- What the hell was that, Darryl?
- Somebody fell on the track.

58:57.426 --> 59:01.783
Grace, hold your position.
Somebody fell on the tracks.

59:01.946 --> 59:06.940
- Keep your eye on Grace.
- Yeah. I can handle that.

59:09.946 --> 59:14.258
- Who's handling dispatch?
- I don't know.

59:20.986 --> 59:23.784
What happened?

59:46.386 --> 59:50.425
- What the fuck ...
- You remember me?

59:50.586 --> 59:53.703
Sure you do.

59:54.386 --> 59:57.184
That's my scent you're wearing.

01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:11.015
- Do you want the money?
- No, I don't want the money.

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:20.186
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:21.539
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:25.062
Freeze!

01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:41.740
Come on!

01:00:46.746 --> 01:00:50.580
Police! Move!

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:13.336
Police! Move!

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:26.144
Out of the way!

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:31.855
Move. Police. Out of the way.

01:01:40.306 --> 01:01:43.139
No. Charlie!

01:02:10.986 --> 01:02:12.977
Move! Get out of the way.

01:02:14.786 --> 01:02:17.141
Move! Police!

01:03:02.786 --> 01:03:07.382
You see what happens
when you play with fire?

01:03:08.626 --> 01:03:11.823
You get burned.

01:04:02.026 --> 01:04:05.098
Perfect.

01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:08.576
You created quite a shit storm.

01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:14.742
You could've blown people away
with your reckless shit.

01:04:14.906 --> 01:04:20.299
Now, if you want to look
like a hero, I think I can help.

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:24.982
Don't worry, kid,
we'll get you out of this one.

01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:27.979
All you've got to do ...

01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:31.695
... is ask for my help.

01:04:34.866 --> 01:04:39.223
It's your badge. It's your life.

01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:42.139
It's your call.

01:04:42.306 --> 01:04:45.343
What do you say?

01:04:48.946 --> 01:04:50.982
No.

01:04:52.066 --> 01:04:54.739
From there.

01:04:54.906 --> 01:04:57.978
Why aren't you laughing?

01:04:58.146 --> 01:05:01.695
Don't you think I'm funny any more?

01:05:01.866 --> 01:05:06.986
- Now, say it.
- You want to hear the words?

01:05:07.146 --> 01:05:11.185
I want to hear the words.

01:05:12.706 --> 01:05:19.259
- Kiss my fucking ass.
- You kiss it. You're fired!

01:05:19.426 --> 01:05:24.705
Get up, Charlie.
We can work this out.

01:05:24.866 --> 01:05:30.975
- Not with this piece of shit.
- Your brother ain't a cop no more.

01:05:31.146 --> 01:05:35.583
- Let me talk to him.
- What do you want to help him for?

01:05:35.746 --> 01:05:39.659
Everybody knows
your brother is a fuckup.

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:43.580
- A what?
- A fuckup.

01:05:43.746 --> 01:05:48.137
I don't have to take this shit.
I'll bust your ass!

01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:53.141
Go ahead. take a bite of me.
You'll never get rid of the taste.

01:05:53.306 --> 01:05:57.458
- You son of a bitch!
- That's it! You're busted!

01:05:57.626 --> 01:06:00.663
I don't have to take this shit!

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:07.061
When your friend calms down,
tell him his badge belongs to me.

01:06:07.226 --> 01:06:13.574
I'll send a uniformed officer around
to pick up my hardware.

01:06:13.746 --> 01:06:19.503
You don't have to send nobody.
You can come and get it yourself.

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:23.022
This is between you and me,
not you and him.

01:06:23.186 --> 01:06:28.385
Who does he think he is? Fuck him!
He's gonna regret this day.

01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:32.061
No, fuck you, Charlie.

01:06:33.466 --> 01:06:36.742
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you.

01:06:36.906 --> 01:06:42.219
I didn't ask you to step in ...
but it'll work out, don't worry.

01:06:42.386 --> 01:06:47.858
No, it's not gonna work out.
Not this time.

01:06:48.026 --> 01:06:51.655
- Come back. bro.
- We're not brothers.

01:06:51.826 --> 01:06:54.898
We have nothing in common.

01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:59.264
I've always been carrying you
on my back.

01:06:59.426 --> 01:07:06.662
Am I gonna give up my career
for you? No! Get out of my life!

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:29.180
Frank, do you happen to know
why blind people don't skydive?

01:07:30.266 --> 01:07:32.700
No, why?

01:07:32.866 --> 01:07:35.824
It scares their dogs.

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:45.375
It scares their ...
You're a tough crowd, Frank.

01:07:45.546 --> 01:07:48.265
Another Jagermeister.

01:07:48.426 --> 01:07:52.544
You've had enough, Charlie.
You're cut off.

01:07:54.986 --> 01:07:58.217
What's your problem?

01:07:58.386 --> 01:08:03.062
You're interfering with me
at the embryo stage of a bender.

01:08:03.226 --> 01:08:07.663
Other than that
I've got nothing to worry about.

01:08:07.826 --> 01:08:13.537
I've got no job, no brother,
no girlfriend, no future ...

01:08:13.706 --> 01:08:19.702
I've got nothing to lose. For the
first time in my life ... I'm free.

01:08:19.866 --> 01:08:25.099
- "God bless us all, Tiny Tim."
- You're over the top, Charlie.

01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:29.179
Don't do anything stupid.

01:08:29.826 --> 01:08:32.545
Where's the fun in that?

01:08:32.746 --> 01:08:36.705
I just remembered,
I have to urinate.

01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:39.505
I'll pick this up later.

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:04.305
I don't have the money.

01:09:04.466 --> 01:09:10.496
Go ahead and kill me.
Right now it'd be a relief.

01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:14.420
I hate to hear
that kind of fatalism, I really do.

01:09:14.586 --> 01:09:21.582
We can't keep on doing this because
it doesn't have any effect on you.

01:09:21.746 --> 01:09:26.216
What I do in a case like yours,
and I'm being forced here ...

01:09:26.386 --> 01:09:29.344
... is threaten someone you love.

01:09:29.506 --> 01:09:32.657
A wife. A child.

01:09:32.826 --> 01:09:37.138
- A brother ...
- Son of a bitch.

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:43.856
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:56.506
January 1st ...
or your nigger brother's dead.

01:11:32.826 --> 01:11:37.616
- What are you doing here, Frank?
- I want to talk about Charlie.

01:11:37.786 --> 01:11:40.937
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:12:23.386 --> 01:12:26.981
Gentlemen, keep the fires hot!

01:12:27.146 --> 01:12:31.697
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Mr. Brown.

01:12:31.866 --> 01:12:34.426
Get out of here.

01:12:34.586 --> 01:12:37.146
You missed.

01:12:39.106 --> 01:12:42.815
I hate that.

01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:53.860
- You've got a disgruntled employee.
- Kick his fucking ...

01:12:55.306 --> 01:12:59.219
You can't come in here like that.

01:12:59.386 --> 01:13:03.618
Stop fucking around.

01:13:03.786 --> 01:13:09.577
Bring him over here. I'll kill him.
You got big balls? I'll cut 'em off.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.985
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:18.343
You bunch of pussies!

01:13:20.706 --> 01:13:26.975
- We're not getting along.
- You want some of me?

01:13:43.546 --> 01:13:46.458
What are you, stupid?

01:13:49.386 --> 01:13:52.059
You'll get your money.

01:13:52.226 --> 01:14:00.179
But if anything happens
to my brother ... You understand me?

01:14:06.586 --> 01:14:09.862
Oh yeah ...
Who are you calling a nigger?

01:14:52.786 --> 01:14:55.858
- Happy New Year.
- Hi. John.

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.662
- Happy New Year.
- Johnny!

01:15:03.186 --> 01:15:07.225
Charlie came by earlier
and left it for you.

01:15:09.106 --> 01:15:13.099
- It took you long enough.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

01:15:14.146 --> 01:15:18.378
What is this dress you've got on?
Turn around.

01:15:18.546 --> 01:15:22.664
- This old rag?
- Just one you had in the closet?

01:15:22.826 --> 01:15:25.863
- You got a permit for this dress?
- You're happy.

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:30.656
I did one last favour for Charlie.
so I'm feeling like a free man.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.896
"The Islands Call."

01:15:33.066 --> 01:15:37.856
- Charlie sent it over.
- Open it.

01:15:45.586 --> 01:15:49.545
- Damn it. He's gonna do it.
- Do what?

01:15:49.706 --> 01:15:52.459
Rob the money train.

01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:56.505
- Say again?
- He's gonna rob the money train.

01:15:56.666 --> 01:16:02.263
- He wants me in with him.
- Patterson will kill him.

01:16:02.426 --> 01:16:06.465
- Aren't you gonna do anything?
- Why should l?

01:16:06.626 --> 01:16:11.859
Charlie is going down ... and you
are the only family that he's got.

01:17:23.266 --> 01:17:25.177
Open up.

01:17:33.386 --> 01:17:35.217
Jesus Christ!

01:18:16.186 --> 01:18:18.097
Shoot!

01:18:32.106 --> 01:18:39.421
- The money train has been stolen!
- I've got to call Patterson.

01:18:59.146 --> 01:19:01.660
Out of the way!

01:19:08.106 --> 01:19:10.825
Move!

01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:42.705
Attention, everyone!

01:19:42.866 --> 01:19:46.461
The situation here
will be resolved immediately.

01:19:46.626 --> 01:19:52.496
These perpetrators are fools
and their luck just ran out.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:57.182
Let's get them. Remember:
The money train has not been stolen.

01:19:57.346 --> 01:20:03.740
It is still in our tunnel.
and soon it will be in our hands.

01:20:53.786 --> 01:20:56.619
Shit!

01:21:29.306 --> 01:21:32.742
You scared the shit out of me. man.

01:21:32.906 --> 01:21:36.979
- How did you find me?
- You told me the plan, remember?

01:21:37.146 --> 01:21:40.377
- Only Plan A. Now we're on B.
- What?

01:21:40.546 --> 01:21:44.334
- We'll figure it out.
- This is Plan B:

01:21:44.506 --> 01:21:50.297
- We leave without the money.
- I ain't down with that.

01:21:50.466 --> 01:21:57.463
- Then we've got a serious problem.
- Yeah, I guess we do.

01:22:00.306 --> 01:22:03.218
If you turn me in, you get a medal.

01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:08.255
- Get us the hell out of here.
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:22:12.826 --> 01:22:16.136
When this is over.
I'll knock you out.

01:22:19.466 --> 01:22:24.381
The money train is reported
going south on the A-line.

01:22:30.306 --> 01:22:37.223
This is Donald Patterson.
Shut down the train and surrender.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:39.422
Don't do that.

01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:46.503
Donald, the robbery's going great
and you'll still get your cut.

01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:50.295
You sons of bitches.
I don't know who you are, -

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:56.302
- but when I get my hands on you
I'll rip your hearts out.

01:22:56.466 --> 01:22:59.936
I don't appreciate
that tone of voice.

01:23:01.946 --> 01:23:04.460
Don't even look at me.

01:23:06.746 --> 01:23:13.458
When Patterson trips the brakes,
our joyride is gonna be over.

01:23:13.626 --> 01:23:17.505
We have to bleed the brakes.

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:23.901
- Great, then they can't stop us.
- Then we can't stop, either.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:29.936
It's bleed the brakes or end up
the butt brothers in D-block.

01:23:30.746 --> 01:23:33.783
Bleed the brakes.

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:40.500
- Get me 42nd Street.
- Stand by for Chief Patterson.

01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:44.181
The money train is coming your way.
Shut her down.

01:23:44.346 --> 01:23:48.055
Trip her brakes.
Reach in and tear her guts out.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:03.176
Come on, baby. It's got to work.

01:24:06.586 --> 01:24:10.215
Yes!

01:24:11.826 --> 01:24:17.935
It didn't stop, sir.
I don't think it has any brakes.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:28.221
I want the shooters
on the Grand Street platform.

01:24:28.386 --> 01:24:34.655
- Aim at the motorman's cabin.
- Use a construction barricade.

01:24:34.826 --> 01:24:39.138
Good point.
I want a barricade in place now!

01:24:39.306 --> 01:24:43.618
That thing's reinforced steel.
They'll be killed.

01:24:47.786 --> 01:24:52.940
Money train, this is Patterson.
I have an information update.

01:24:53.106 --> 01:24:57.657
At the Grand Street Station we have
a reinforced steel barricade.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:01.865
Shut it down
and turn yourself in ...

01:25:02.026 --> 01:25:04.062
... or die!

01:25:04.546 --> 01:25:08.061
He's bluffing, right?

01:25:21.026 --> 01:25:24.541
You. over there.
You to. come with me.

01:25:28.426 --> 01:25:32.863
What are we gonna do?
We can't stop this thing.

01:25:33.026 --> 01:25:37.099
Go faster. Faster!

01:25:39.866 --> 01:25:43.222
Come on!

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:50.259
Charlie ... he wasn't bluffing!

01:26:06.506 --> 01:26:08.940
Ready. Easy, now.

01:26:14.906 --> 01:26:17.784
Wait for my command.

01:26:19.786 --> 01:26:22.425
Fire!

01:27:04.466 --> 01:27:08.664
You're not gonna believe this.
The train broke the barricade.

01:27:32.586 --> 01:27:36.499
- I'll have to start clearing track.
- Wait a minute.

01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:40.295
- What's the nearest train?
- The 12:20. I'll sidetrack her.

01:27:40.466 --> 01:27:46.621
What? And give them a clear track?
Raise me the motorman.

01:27:46.786 --> 01:27:51.541
- Command to 12:20.
- 12:20 to Command.

01:27:51.706 --> 01:27:55.745
This is Donald Patterson.
Bypass all stops.

01:27:55.906 --> 01:27:59.421
- What's going on?
- Shut up and do your job!

01:28:08.466 --> 01:28:12.778
Maybe we're on the wrong train.
It didn't stop.

01:28:20.266 --> 01:28:25.704
Two trains are on the same track.
there could be a derailment.

01:28:25.866 --> 01:28:32.783
There'll be no derailment.
They'll shut the money train down.

01:28:32.946 --> 01:28:37.974
If the money train can't stop,
people could die.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.740
That's what we live with.

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:55.342
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- I'm getting paid.

01:28:55.506 --> 01:28:59.055
- The money stays.
- Feel that.

01:28:59.226 --> 01:29:04.425
That's our freedom.
I'm not leaving here empty handed.

01:29:04.586 --> 01:29:10.661
"Charlie the loser."
I've heard that my whole life.

01:29:10.826 --> 01:29:17.538
- Thieves aren't winners.
- Save the lecture for Tahiti.

01:29:17.706 --> 01:29:20.095
No, forget it.

01:29:21.986 --> 01:29:27.344
Don't fuck with my fantasy!
lf you want out, get out of my face!

01:29:27.506 --> 01:29:33.661
- I won't let you ruin your life.
- How are you gonna save me?

01:29:41.266 --> 01:29:43.985
Get that foot off that bag!

01:29:51.186 --> 01:29:55.145
Don't try me. Are you trying me?

01:29:57.586 --> 01:30:04.139
- Just let it go.
- I'm taking the money, man.

01:30:36.626 --> 01:30:38.184
Damn!

01:30:45.426 --> 01:30:47.940
Give me your hand.

01:30:54.026 --> 01:30:57.382
Grab onto my hand!

01:30:57.546 --> 01:31:01.334
- I've got you, man.
- Charlie ...

01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:05.822
Come on. John.

01:31:28.786 --> 01:31:32.222
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:33.426 --> 01:31:38.659
- Are we straight?
- Yeah, we're straight.

01:31:50.106 --> 01:31:54.975
- Let's shut this puppy down.
- That's easier said than done.

01:31:55.146 --> 01:31:59.503
You and me. man.
What can stop us?

01:32:06.546 --> 01:32:10.095
My God!

01:32:34.026 --> 01:32:36.938
Patterson didn't clear the tracks.

01:32:37.106 --> 01:32:43.659
- We're gonna derail them.
- These people are gonna die.

01:32:43.826 --> 01:32:48.297
- Do something.
- The bitch won't move.

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.657
Maximum speed.

01:32:53.826 --> 01:33:00.265
The other train's too fast!
We're fucking dead! You hear me?

01:33:04.426 --> 01:33:09.580
All emergency units,
head to Fort Hamilton Station.

01:33:15.106 --> 01:33:21.420
- Throw the damn thing in reverse.
- The train will do a somersault.

01:33:21.586 --> 01:33:26.535
- But we live, right?
- No, they live. We die.

01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:34.060
So be it. We hit the reverse switch
and say goodbye.

01:33:34.226 --> 01:33:38.265
- We don't have time for this.
- Just jump, man.

01:33:38.426 --> 01:33:41.543
I can't jump! We're in a tunnel!

01:33:41.706 --> 01:33:45.460
This is my responsibility.
It's my fuckup!

01:33:45.626 --> 01:33:47.821
We're in this together.

01:34:01.786 --> 01:34:04.619
What are you doing?

01:34:04.786 --> 01:34:08.540
Are you gonna pole vault
out of here?

01:34:10.826 --> 01:34:16.219
Autopilot. When this hits,
it'll throw her into reverse.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:31.262
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know.

01:34:35.906 --> 01:34:39.694
- Where's my train?
- It's to minutes out.

01:34:39.866 --> 01:34:42.016
Good!

01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:52.936
When we get out of this,
remind me ...

01:34:55.466 --> 01:34:58.936
Don't let go.

01:35:05.426 --> 01:35:09.260
Get to the front.

01:36:27.866 --> 01:36:32.986
- Are they dead?
- There's nobody here.

01:36:33.146 --> 01:36:36.377
They're here.

01:36:39.186 --> 01:36:43.065
They're here. You fuck with my train
and I'll find you.

01:36:46.306 --> 01:36:49.218
I'll find you.

01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:55.862
- Shit! Is that Patterson?
- Get out of my way.

01:36:56.946 --> 01:37:00.734
- What are we gonna do?
- I'll find you.

01:37:00.906 --> 01:37:04.455
Be cool.

01:37:06.386 --> 01:37:10.743
- We came as fast as we could.
- What a mess.

01:37:10.906 --> 01:37:15.024
- If we can help ...
- All you've got to do is ask.

01:37:15.186 --> 01:37:22.581
- What are you doing here?
- We just want to help.

01:37:22.746 --> 01:37:28.343
How's your cock working now that
you ain't got a badge any more?

01:37:28.506 --> 01:37:32.738
This is what I think of you,
you fuckup ...

01:37:32.906 --> 01:37:35.374
You spit in my face?

01:37:35.546 --> 01:37:38.856
You aren't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him!

01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:41.586
We'll both hit him.

01:37:49.546 --> 01:37:52.697
Arrest those to for assault.

01:37:54.866 --> 01:38:00.498
No, Patterson, I'm arresting you.
You endangered people's lives.

01:38:02.266 --> 01:38:05.383
Did you see that?

01:38:07.466 --> 01:38:10.503
Arrest his ass! He tried to kill us!

01:38:10.666 --> 01:38:15.456
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?

01:38:15.626 --> 01:38:19.938
Officer Santiago.

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:49.659
- We did it!
- We did it!

01:38:51.186 --> 01:38:54.223
Happy New Year.

01:38:54.386 --> 01:38:57.139
I love you, man.

01:38:57.306 --> 01:39:02.300
- What is that?
- I've put on some weight.

01:39:02.466 --> 01:39:08.985
- What are you, six months pregnant?
- You're gonna overreact on this.

01:39:11.106 --> 01:39:14.815
- I knew you'd overreact.
- Overreact?

01:39:14.986 --> 01:39:18.342
We risked our lives. man.

01:39:18.506 --> 01:39:21.862
It's New Year's.

01:39:22.026 --> 01:39:28.818
- I saved your life.
- It's a miracle we're alive.
