01:57.049 --> 01:58.050
Where we at?

01:59.084 --> 02:00.921
He's dropping in five.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.697
What's up, little sister?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.433
Where's this moppet at?

02:58.411 --> 03:01.450
- I hope he enjoys himself.
- All right, here we go.

03:24.671 --> 03:25.639
Shit.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.020
Your middle name should
have been "abortion."

03:39.085 --> 03:40.855
He at the shoot house yet?

03:40.920 --> 03:44.059
He's pretty close.
We made it impossible though.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.263
- Eight rounds, nine targets.
- That's not very nice, Henry.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.261
Yeah yeah, he shot Michael.

04:21.326 --> 04:24.031
It's way too soon.
Way fucking too soon.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.702
All right, here we go, last room.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.450
- Why don't you ever do that?
- Fuck you.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.620
Bring him in.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.060
"G"!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.431
Enjoy your run back to base.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.484
Top man!

05:21.221 --> 05:23.024
Oh, thank you.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.195
- Preston.
- Jonathan... Gates.

05:26.258 --> 05:28.362
Seriously, who throws
a fucking pistol, mate?

05:28.428 --> 05:31.166
Just seemed like the
thing to do at the time.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.134
- Banger?
- Absolutely.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.470
Good, how you doing?
Good to see you, Gates.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.706
- You too, Henry.
- We've gotta get the rest

05:38.771 --> 05:40.908
of your paperwork ironed out.
Locke's inside.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.544
Roger that.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.713
- Hang tight on that. I'll be back.
- No worries.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.783
Oi!
Food's ready.

05:50.717 --> 05:51.919
Well, this is home.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.023
- I like it.
- This is "V."

05:56.089 --> 05:58.727
Hi, how you doing?

05:58.791 --> 06:02.063
- He's shy.
- Gates!

06:05.164 --> 06:07.869
You, my friend, are a
complete fucking psycho.

06:07.934 --> 06:08.902
He's certainly got...

06:08.968 --> 06:10.690
Don't you have some
goddamn paperwork to do?

06:10.737 --> 06:12.907
- You got some child support to pay?
- Fuck you.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.417
- Welcome to the BlackJacks.
- Thank you, sir.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.518
Follow me.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.456
I have thrown a pistol before,

06:28.521 --> 06:30.791
but never in a shoot house.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.027
Yeah, me neither.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.762
I almost didn't do it.

06:36.361 --> 06:38.331
It held up pretty well.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.100
Springfield.

06:41.601 --> 06:44.573
- I'm a Kimber man myself.
- I like Kimber.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.475
Springfield just feels right.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.244
So, Gates,

06:51.311 --> 06:53.683
what was your monthly
take-home in the army?

06:53.746 --> 06:56.117
- 4170 with BAH.
- Mmm.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.554
Our minimum contracts

06:58.618 --> 07:00.621
are six figures apiece.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.658
The thing is I've seen a lot of guys

07:03.723 --> 07:06.160
lose their shit when they start
making that kind of money.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.932
Trust me, you're gonna need help
figuring out what to do with it.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.634
I know a few bean counters.
They'll get you squared away

07:12.699 --> 07:14.903
and make sure you don't
blow it up your nose.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.770
Appreciate it.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.410
- You got some talent.
- Thank you.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.847
Talent just tells me that you can.

07:26.913 --> 07:30.352
What concerns me is if you will.

07:38.157 --> 07:39.693
I got one rule, Gates.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.634
Never question me.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.570
Welcome aboard.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.549
Miss!

08:36.616 --> 08:38.720
We already checked that
whole south sector.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.910
Jesus!
Smith, over here!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.081
Don't worry, sir.
We'll get you out of here.

09:55.361 --> 09:56.897
Hi.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.328
You get any sleep last night?

10:30.596 --> 10:32.967
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.668
Alison.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.005
Don't be afraid.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.542
I'm not.
It's just that...

10:40.606 --> 10:43.143
there has to be something
else we can do.

10:43.209 --> 10:46.014
- Like what?
- We could do nothing.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.455
I did this.
I cannot let anyone else

10:53.520 --> 10:55.557
be responsible for its outcome.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.759
It's too valuable.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.092
Is it worth it?

11:05.264 --> 11:07.569
- I miss your mom.
- Me too,

11:07.633 --> 11:10.204
- and I want to go home.
- We are going home.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.394
Hey.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.305
Of course I'm a cutthroat.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.675
You don't get to where
I'm at by being a pussy.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.143
I'm unapologetically ruthless,

12:56.208 --> 12:58.011
or ruthlessly unapologetic,

12:58.077 --> 13:00.982
but there's no mystery there.
You don't need that for the article.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.585
Why don't you get to the point

13:03.650 --> 13:06.722
and ask me what you
came here to ask me?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.288
What did I come here to ask you?

13:08.354 --> 13:10.425
You want to know where
Dr. Whitmore is.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.963
Okay. One of the finest energy
researchers in the country

13:14.026 --> 13:15.996
has been missing for...
nine months.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.467
Where is your former partner?

13:18.532 --> 13:20.802
I don't know.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.070
We think he was kidnapped.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.372
What I do know

13:25.439 --> 13:27.409
is we have a $3.5 million effort,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.444
and the finest people in the world

13:29.509 --> 13:31.078
are looking for him.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.416
Why don't we take
a few pictures...

13:35.449 --> 13:36.517
in the bedroom?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.689
Sir?

13:40.753 --> 13:43.290
- There's a situation.
- Mm-hmm.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.060
Give me 19 minutes.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.497
We don't have 19 minutes.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.770
Mmm, this interview...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.671
is over.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.543
No.

16:36.195 --> 16:39.034
Tell me... everything.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.603
We lost all communication
with the facility

16:41.668 --> 16:43.805
approximately 26 minutes ago.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.305
We were alerted when the reactor

16:45.371 --> 16:47.442
started producing dangerous
levels of energy.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.944
Just as we got online, the
entire facility went dark.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.349
When can we be back online?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.887
We can't, not from here.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.690
Someone has to re-establish
communication from the inside.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.324
Fuck!

17:03.389 --> 17:05.827
Whitmore has something
to do with this.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.829
We should terminate the project.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.703
- I can fix this.
- Sir, if this gets out...

17:14.768 --> 17:17.305
I'm not gonna blow up a
billion-dollar facility

17:17.368 --> 17:19.005
just because the phones are down.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.576
I want the best combat
extraction team available

17:21.641 --> 17:24.813
to go in and get me Whitmore.
I don't care what it costs.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.371
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.240
Get to the airstrip.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.411
Now?

17:56.476 --> 17:57.544
Yeah.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.157
- What's taking so long?
- Just waiting for a signal.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.824
Should be about five minutes, sir.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.610
You guys got me?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.646
We got you, Henry.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.356
We don't have
time for formalities.

19:48.421 --> 19:52.361
Apparently your team is the
best, so I've hired you.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.996
To the point: two days ago

19:55.061 --> 19:57.599
I lost contact with an
off-the-books facility

19:57.664 --> 19:59.366
I have in Khazakstan.

19:59.432 --> 20:03.105
Now if you watch the news, you would
know my partner Dr. Mark Whitmore

20:03.168 --> 20:05.439
has been missing for some time.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.345
He's not. He's here working
for me at this very location.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.313
The following is the last
footage we have of him

20:12.377 --> 20:14.247
before the drop in communication.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.328
There was seismic activity
at the time of the recording.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.830
It might be the reason
for the drop.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.068
I don't care.
I just need to know he's alive.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.705
I've lost contact with
above-ground security

20:35.768 --> 20:38.640
that guards the entrance.
Link up with them

20:38.705 --> 20:40.340
if they're still onsite.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.678
I understand your team has worked

20:43.743 --> 20:45.446
with psychic operators before.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.684
Lisa Westbrook is the
best in the business.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.221
If Whitmore is down there,
she will find him.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.459
Don't fuck this up.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.596
Please.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.138
All right, guys.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.441
I'll be in your ears
till you reach the base,

21:13.506 --> 21:16.310
then we're going to be black until
you fire up the link underground.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.045
Roger that, Henry.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.218
Miss Westbrook?

21:25.284 --> 21:28.424
Lisa, please.
It's fairly straightforward.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.727
I just need to get close enough
to get a lock on the doctor.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.930
And once I have positive ID,
you will get him and get out.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.601
Exactly how are you going
to "lock in" on their location?

21:49.274 --> 21:52.581
So I round the corner, right?
And this fucking guy is shirtless

21:52.645 --> 21:55.450
and he's holding back four of
these huge Brazilian dudes,

21:55.515 --> 21:58.554
guns drawn, and he's got a knife
to the throat of the bouncer

21:58.618 --> 22:01.189
and I'm like, "Jesus. What the
fuck have I stumbled into?"

22:01.253 --> 22:03.357
- They were Puerto Rican.
- What?

22:03.423 --> 22:05.325
Hey, I got this round.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.960
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's on me.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.230
- Thanks, Gatesy.
- Fuckin-A, new guy.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.465
Right on.
Make it a double!

22:11.531 --> 22:14.168
- Can I get you something?
- No thanks.

22:14.234 --> 22:16.304
I got one.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.941
Can I ask you a question?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.444
Sure.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.880
How long have you been psychic?

22:25.945 --> 22:28.784
Or whatever the
gift is that you have.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.350
Why?

22:30.416 --> 22:32.620
Sorry.
Didn't mean to pry.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.755
No no, it's...

22:34.821 --> 22:36.658
it's fine.

22:39.259 --> 22:41.964
My mom has some sort of gift.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.433
She gets these
feelings about things.

22:44.497 --> 22:47.569
- Empathic.
- Yeah, maybe.

22:47.634 --> 22:50.973
But it was kinda rough
growing up like that.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.141
I can't even imagine what
it was like for you.

22:56.409 --> 22:59.180
You know, you don't strike
me as the operator type.

23:01.014 --> 23:04.019
Yo, V, what is up?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.421
Nice!
Where are we going, huh?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.489
You want to get out of here?

23:14.527 --> 23:18.401
Yeah, the Air Force is
full of Alternative Units.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.668
- Do they recruit or what?
- Uh-huh.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.438
My first unit was a
remote viewing squadron.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.372
And what was your job?

23:25.438 --> 23:27.408
I worked with a lot
of para-rescue guys.

23:27.473 --> 23:30.110
You know, finding
downed pilots and such.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.447
- Oh.
- And then the last few years

23:32.512 --> 23:34.682
I worked strictly with a
snatch-and-grab team.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.118
Like kicking in doors?

23:37.183 --> 23:39.153
Yeah.

23:39.218 --> 23:42.425
Well, I was there more to
find the target, obviously.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.359
So why'd you get out?

23:46.426 --> 23:49.063
I, um...

23:51.597 --> 23:54.034
I did some things that
I wasn't proud of.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.676
So tell me how it works.

24:01.741 --> 24:04.078
- What?
- Finding people.

24:04.143 --> 24:07.917
Okay, so your body
gives off a vibration

24:07.980 --> 24:12.422
that I can feel. And
everyone's is slightly different.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.424
And you can feel this
anywhere in the world?

24:15.488 --> 24:17.925
Oh no no no.
I mean, I can only do it

24:17.990 --> 24:20.227
- within a mile or so.
- Oh.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.763
Here, watch.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.600
Oh shit!

24:29.369 --> 24:31.474
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to freak you out.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.607
No, that's... that's incredible.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.911
Can you do that again?

24:38.611 --> 24:41.516
Yeah. Yeah, I can't do
it for very long though.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.262
- Jesus.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.930
What was that?

24:56.996 --> 24:59.434
That's never happened before.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.169
Are you sure you're okay?

25:04.237 --> 25:05.740
Yeah, you know, I'd better...

25:05.805 --> 25:08.309
- go to bed.
- Yeah.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.912
Sorry about your finger.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.519
There you go, swag monkey.
Good boy.

26:50.209 --> 26:53.583
I can't believe you're
actually jumping with us.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.115
I hope you don't burn in.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.555
I only weigh 100 lbs.
I'd just bounce off the ground.

27:02.355 --> 27:04.125
All right, BlackJacks!

27:09.530 --> 27:11.600
Don't be pussies.

27:53.239 --> 27:56.746
That's cute. Are you gonna
walk 10 paces behind us?

27:56.809 --> 27:59.280
Are you gonna button your fly?

28:04.116 --> 28:05.652
Underwear, mate.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.053
Knock it off. Let's go.

28:08.488 --> 28:09.623
It chafes too much.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.401
- "Men in Black."
- Will Smith.

28:24.404 --> 28:26.173
"Independence Day."

28:32.945 --> 28:34.848
Brent Spiner.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.053
Who the fuck is Brent Spiner?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.757
He was the scientist dude.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.596
Challenge.

28:47.660 --> 28:50.832
Brent Spiner was Data on "Star
Trek: The Next Generation."

28:54.800 --> 28:56.570
You are such a fucking nerd.

29:14.387 --> 29:16.057
So what do you do for fun?

29:18.991 --> 29:20.861
- Just making small talk.
- Shh shh shh.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.130
- What's up?
- Hold on a second.

29:31.505 --> 29:33.274
- What's up?
- I'm picking up

29:33.339 --> 29:35.944
a group of people
about a mile away.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.544
- Can you tell who they are?
- No.

29:37.611 --> 29:39.815
They're all males.
There's about 15 of them.

29:41.881 --> 29:45.455
Henry, any chance we can
get eyes on location?

29:45.519 --> 29:47.789
Lisa's picking up targets nearby.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.224
Negative, Locke.
Your sat's still down.

29:51.525 --> 29:53.795
You know what? Let me see
what I can piggyback on.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.672
Locke, wait one...
there's a Russian satellite.

30:02.735 --> 30:03.970
I'll give it a shot.

30:17.349 --> 30:20.689
Locke, I got eyes on, but the
image is completely scrambled.

30:20.753 --> 30:22.021
Roger.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.967
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.907
Hey, V.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.109
I need you right there.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.211
Ed, Preston.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.483
You guys post up right here.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.185
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

30:52.251 --> 30:54.121
You're with V.

30:56.556 --> 30:58.493
She can tell us
where everybody is.

31:01.762 --> 31:03.397
Stay at least 40 meters behind me.

31:03.463 --> 31:05.900
And don't give away my position.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.601
Okay.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.038
Gates.
You're with me.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.539
What do you think, V?

31:44.604 --> 31:47.208
- Looks like a merc group.
- They're Chechen.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.676
I've seen their kind before.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.412
Yusufiyah '05.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.246
They're nasty.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.916
I've had some experience
with these clowns as well.

31:58.819 --> 32:01.624
Hey, they have an
American down there.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.259
- Henry.
- Go ahead.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.960
We have eyes on location.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.130
There's a group of
hostiles on the ground.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.569
Hey, I've got casualties
in the west corner.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.938
Looks like they've killed
the security detail.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.138
There's one left alive.

32:20.841 --> 32:22.243
Locke.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.744
I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

32:23.810 --> 32:25.145
He's about to take this guy down.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.581
Hold your fire, V.

32:26.646 --> 32:28.950
I say again, I have the shot.

32:29.014 --> 32:32.153
Negative. Don't
compromise your position.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.088
We can't maneuver from here.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.958
Locke,
they're gonna kill this guy.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.825
- We're running out of time.
- Stand down.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.861
You take that shot,
we'll have 20 Aks

32:40.926 --> 32:42.228
lighting this hill up.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.432
Henry, you tell Cromwell

32:44.497 --> 32:46.132
we're taking these fuckers out.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.403
That's a go, Locke.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.070
- All right.
- Fuck!

32:50.135 --> 32:52.807
God damn it, God damn it.

32:52.873 --> 32:55.344
God damn it.

32:57.611 --> 32:58.980
Fuck!

32:59.044 --> 33:01.214
All right, we're gonna
secure this compound.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.652
V, you wait for us
to get into position,

33:03.717 --> 33:06.154
then on my signal start
putting fuckers to sleep.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.188
About fucking time.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.024
Gates and I will lead.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.429
Ed, Preston,
you two follow and flank.

33:13.493 --> 33:16.397
Let's get as close as we
can before we go loud.

33:16.463 --> 33:19.201
Lisa, tell me how many
targets are down there.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.701
16 total targets.

33:20.767 --> 33:22.604
Most are in the main building.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.439
All right, gentlemen,
nothing fancy.

33:24.504 --> 33:26.039
Straightforward violence of action.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.441
Let's go.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.228
Go hot

34:22.293 --> 34:23.664
in three...

34:24.731 --> 34:26.065
two...

34:27.734 --> 34:28.702
One.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.420
Motherfucker!

34:47.487 --> 34:49.757
Fuck, Ed.

34:59.733 --> 35:01.268
V, a little help!

35:13.145 --> 35:15.148
I don't got a shot
on the guys inside.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.636
V, there's three coming around
the back of the building.

35:34.701 --> 35:37.840
- There's nothing there.
- Just wait, they're coming around.

35:48.014 --> 35:49.717
Lisa,
don't let that fucker flank us!

36:59.318 --> 37:01.423
- Gates?
- Clear!

37:01.488 --> 37:02.890
All clear, Eddie.

37:07.927 --> 37:09.362
V, we're coming out.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.817
Get away from me.

38:02.882 --> 38:05.654
BlackJack!

38:07.687 --> 38:09.557
Don't say a fucking word.

38:09.622 --> 38:12.226
Never shoot through
a fucking door, fuck!

38:12.291 --> 38:14.228
- All right, all right.
- Motherfucker!

38:14.293 --> 38:16.230
Getting a bit old for this,
Locke, eh?

38:16.295 --> 38:18.500
- Fuck you!
- He's hit.

38:21.701 --> 38:22.903
Just cover it.

38:24.003 --> 38:26.675
Lisa, are we clear down here?

38:26.739 --> 38:28.876
No one around but you guys.

38:28.942 --> 38:30.745
All right, V, bring it in.

38:42.422 --> 38:44.459
These assholes stink.

39:26.599 --> 39:27.901
Look what I found.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.838
Oh shit.

39:33.206 --> 39:35.310
- Henry.
- Go ahead.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.479
The Chechens were here
for Whitmore.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.480
We found his pictures
on one of them.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.016
- What? Did they find the entrance?
- No.

39:42.081 --> 39:43.484
It was covered when we got here.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.018
Fuck!

39:45.084 --> 39:46.921
Okay,
tell me when you have him.

39:50.490 --> 39:51.725
Yeah.

39:52.792 --> 39:54.829
Let's go. Get it off.

40:15.882 --> 40:17.017
Shit.

41:05.264 --> 41:06.399
On me.

41:12.405 --> 41:14.341
Hey, hold up.

41:14.407 --> 41:16.143
Can I take a look at
that map for a second?

41:17.310 --> 41:18.980
Gates, map.

41:25.852 --> 41:28.256
All right, so I'm picking up

41:28.321 --> 41:30.124
what looks like

41:30.189 --> 41:31.659
the reactor right there.

41:31.724 --> 41:34.529
It's giving off a
lot of interference.

41:34.594 --> 41:36.330
And I'm picking up what

41:36.396 --> 41:38.634
I think is Dr. Whitmore
right here.

41:38.698 --> 41:40.501
He's in the lab area.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.302
Good.

41:44.637 --> 41:46.707
I'm not picking up
anyone else down here.

41:49.542 --> 41:52.146
It doesn't matter.
Our mission's the doctor.

41:52.211 --> 41:53.981
- We get him, we get out.
- Roger that.

41:55.348 --> 41:57.051
On me.

42:23.376 --> 42:24.344
It's blood.

42:26.813 --> 42:28.650
Somebody was pissed off.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.923
You don't have to worry about it.
There's no one else down here.

42:34.987 --> 42:36.824
I think we've got it, Westbrook.

42:45.765 --> 42:46.867
Clear left!

42:47.900 --> 42:49.803
Clear right!

42:49.869 --> 42:51.839
- Center clear.
- Room clear.

42:59.812 --> 43:01.782
What the fuck?

43:17.563 --> 43:19.767
Are you sure you're not
picking up anybody?

43:19.832 --> 43:21.267
No one.

43:24.804 --> 43:26.507
Tell me when he gets close.

43:26.572 --> 43:28.442
100 meters.

43:28.509 --> 43:30.412
On Eddie, let's go!
Move out.

44:12.419 --> 44:13.988
Which way, Gates?

44:16.856 --> 44:18.993
Okay, left takes us
to the comm room.

44:19.058 --> 44:20.928
And if we head right

44:20.993 --> 44:23.364
that should take us down
to the lower research lab.

44:26.299 --> 44:27.502
Eddie.

44:29.469 --> 44:31.806
Take Preston, go left,
set up comms.

44:31.871 --> 44:33.841
We'll grab the target
and meet you there.

44:33.906 --> 44:36.110
Be fast. I don't want
to be here all day.

44:37.643 --> 44:39.513
Are you sure you want to separate?

44:39.580 --> 44:41.115
Yeah, I'm sure.

44:41.180 --> 44:42.950
- Westbrook!
- Yeah?

44:43.015 --> 44:45.319
You're positive
he's down this way?

44:48.354 --> 44:50.157
Gates.

44:51.958 --> 44:53.895
V.

45:49.516 --> 45:52.087
- Clear.
- Fuck off.

46:03.262 --> 46:04.765
Is it gonna work?

46:04.830 --> 46:06.600
I sure as shit hope so.

46:09.869 --> 46:11.104
Bingo.

46:31.057 --> 46:32.927
- Clear left.
- Clear right. Room clear on me.

46:45.171 --> 46:47.341
- He should be right about here.
- Go go.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.015
Whitmore!

46:56.916 --> 46:58.419
Dr. Whitmore.

46:58.485 --> 46:59.820
Open the door!

46:59.885 --> 47:02.322
- No.
- Open the door.

47:02.388 --> 47:04.893
Cromwell sent us.
Open the door.

47:08.861 --> 47:10.598
Open the fucking door.

47:10.664 --> 47:12.601
No.

47:20.407 --> 47:22.009
I got you, Ed.
You got picture?

47:24.176 --> 47:26.313
Ed, do you have video?
Do you have audio?

47:26.378 --> 47:29.383
- Ed!
- I heard you the first time, fuckstick.

47:29.449 --> 47:33.456
Hey, I'm not paying
you to fuck around!

47:33.520 --> 47:36.157
Show some respect.
Where's Whitmore?

47:36.222 --> 47:38.059
The rest of our team
are acquiring him.

47:38.124 --> 47:39.527
They'll be here shortly.

47:39.593 --> 47:41.964
All right, what's the
status of my facility?

47:42.027 --> 47:44.632
Unknown. From what
the psychic tells us

47:44.698 --> 47:46.902
there's no one here
except the doctor.

47:46.966 --> 47:49.203
- There's nobody down there?!
- No.

47:49.268 --> 47:50.370
Son of a bitch.

48:03.583 --> 48:05.653
The doctor should
be here shortly, sir.

48:05.719 --> 48:07.188
Find him.

48:07.253 --> 48:08.889
Find him!

48:11.223 --> 48:13.928
Hey, Whitmore, open the door!

48:15.495 --> 48:18.233
Dr. Whitmore?
Dr. Whitmore, look at me.

48:18.297 --> 48:21.102
Look at me. I need you
to open the door for us.

48:22.168 --> 48:23.504
Can you do that for me?

48:23.570 --> 48:25.974
We're here to protect you.
Can you open the door?

48:33.112 --> 48:34.347
Open the fucking door.

48:39.786 --> 48:41.689
You gotta...
you gotta close the door.

48:41.755 --> 48:43.959
You gotta...
I'm sorry... ow!

48:44.023 --> 48:45.893
Ow!
Close the door!

48:45.958 --> 48:48.395
Close the door!
Close the door!

48:48.461 --> 48:50.998
You have to lock that door!
You have to lock the door!

48:52.198 --> 48:53.434
Close the door!

48:53.500 --> 48:56.171
- Close it, please please please.
- Do it.

49:16.088 --> 49:17.825
You comfy?

49:26.966 --> 49:28.502
I'll get it, I'll get it.

49:53.259 --> 49:54.795
What happened down here, doc?

49:55.995 --> 49:58.299
Where's your staff?

49:59.900 --> 50:01.302
Hey!

50:05.505 --> 50:07.475
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

50:21.086 --> 50:22.354
What are they doing?

50:23.690 --> 50:25.252
Preston,
can I get an ETA on the doctor?

50:25.257 --> 50:27.160
Yeah, hold on a sec.

50:37.804 --> 50:39.039
Ed, what the fuck?!

50:39.104 --> 50:40.640
Contact, contact!

50:40.707 --> 50:42.610
Lisa, help Whitmore.
Preston, we're on our way!

50:42.676 --> 50:44.646
- No, I'm not going out there!
- Let's move, move move move!

50:44.711 --> 50:45.872
I'm not going out back there.

50:46.713 --> 50:47.681
Ed!

50:48.981 --> 50:49.982
Preston!

50:50.049 --> 50:51.485
Motherfucker!

51:18.912 --> 51:21.149
Preston, Preston, wake up.

51:21.213 --> 51:22.883
Preston, hey!

51:22.949 --> 51:24.786
Come on, Preston!

51:26.251 --> 51:27.821
Fuck!
Come on, man, come...

51:27.887 --> 51:29.490
Move move move move!

51:34.828 --> 51:37.934
- Breathe breathe.
- Ed, Ed, Ed!

51:37.998 --> 51:40.235
- Oh shit.
- Gotta breathe, gotta breathe, come on.

51:40.299 --> 51:41.735
Breathe breathe breathe.

51:41.801 --> 51:43.471
Come on, let's get up.

51:43.536 --> 51:44.738
You can stand. Ready?

51:47.072 --> 51:49.577
Let's go.
Get him the fuck in there!

51:49.642 --> 51:52.414
Ed? Fuck!

51:53.546 --> 51:55.148
Locke, they got Ed!

51:55.214 --> 51:58.421
Who got Ed?
What the fuck happened, Whitmore?

52:04.624 --> 52:06.995
Ed, Ed!

52:08.060 --> 52:09.596
Ed!

52:10.830 --> 52:13.100
Ed! Ed!

52:49.168 --> 52:51.105
Fuck.
Come on, Gates.

52:51.170 --> 52:52.673
Fuck. Come on.

52:53.740 --> 52:54.908
Whitmore.

52:56.009 --> 52:58.514
- Whitmore!
- Talk, fucker.

52:59.679 --> 53:01.783
There was an accident.

53:01.848 --> 53:03.618
Locke, where's Ed?

53:03.683 --> 53:05.820
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up!

53:05.885 --> 53:07.822
Henry, calm down.

53:07.887 --> 53:11.427
I need you to get us out of here.
Don't lose your head.

53:11.491 --> 53:14.128
- Whitmore!
- There's some kind of creature

53:14.193 --> 53:16.898
running loose down here.
It killed everybody.

53:18.031 --> 53:20.135
What the fuck
are you talking about?

53:20.199 --> 53:23.406
- Henry.
- What, the entire staff is dead?

53:26.205 --> 53:27.641
Everybody.

53:32.177 --> 53:34.649
Cromwell you get that door open!

53:36.549 --> 53:38.586
Cromwell, open that fucking door!

53:38.651 --> 53:40.387
All right.

53:41.754 --> 53:42.922
V?

53:46.960 --> 53:48.697
V.

53:54.634 --> 53:56.370
Henry!

54:00.473 --> 54:02.008
You motherfucker!

54:02.075 --> 54:03.945
Fucker!

54:09.816 --> 54:12.053
...fucking kill you.

54:18.424 --> 54:20.360
Goddamn motherfucker!

54:39.211 --> 54:42.183
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

54:45.018 --> 54:48.525
Motherfucker!
Goddamn motherfucker!

54:48.588 --> 54:50.324
Fucker!

54:59.832 --> 55:01.134
V.

55:03.302 --> 55:04.605
We'll fix it.

55:04.671 --> 55:06.674
Let's finish this mission.

55:06.739 --> 55:08.208
Gear up.

55:10.009 --> 55:12.514
We need an exit. Ideas?

55:12.579 --> 55:15.484
- Blow the door?
- We don't have enough C4.

55:15.548 --> 55:17.852
Plus it's a fucking shaft.

55:19.351 --> 55:20.821
Tell us how to get out of here.

55:23.690 --> 55:25.994
- Take me with you.
- He'll slow us down.

55:26.059 --> 55:27.361
- You want to go or not?
- Hey!

55:27.427 --> 55:29.597
Fucking cooperate with us,
all right?

55:29.662 --> 55:31.532
Just cooperate with us
and we will get you

55:31.598 --> 55:33.468
out of here, you understand that?

55:37.770 --> 55:40.341
There's a tunnel at the
far side of the complex

55:40.406 --> 55:41.775
leading into the valley.

55:41.841 --> 55:44.145
Show me.

55:48.581 --> 55:50.685
- That's a tunnel?
- Yeah.

55:53.186 --> 55:54.889
All right, I can get us there.

55:54.954 --> 55:58.193
- Alive, I hope.
- That depends on you.

55:58.258 --> 56:00.228
What are we up against out there?

56:04.931 --> 56:07.403
It came through the reactor.

56:07.467 --> 56:10.205
I developed a machine that could
capture ribbons of energy

56:10.270 --> 56:12.273
in a parallel dimension.

56:12.337 --> 56:14.274
Cromwell was funding it.

56:14.339 --> 56:17.244
But three months ago he started
to threaten me and my daughter,

56:17.309 --> 56:19.647
and I knew that if I delivered
him the complete works,

56:19.712 --> 56:22.918
I would be dead.
So I overcharged the reactor

56:22.982 --> 56:25.854
causing a distraction, during
which I was supposed to meet

56:25.918 --> 56:28.556
a rescue team that would take
me over the Russian border.

56:28.621 --> 56:31.760
Your rescue party was a group
of Chechen terrorists.

56:31.824 --> 56:34.896
No! No no, they were just
supposed to escort me.

56:36.829 --> 56:39.467
I had to get somewhere where
Cromwell couldn't get to me.

56:39.532 --> 56:41.067
Focus.

56:41.134 --> 56:42.670
Describe it.

56:42.735 --> 56:44.337
Is it biological?

56:44.404 --> 56:46.240
Is it mechanical? What is it?

56:46.306 --> 56:47.876
I only saw it for a moment.

56:47.940 --> 56:52.048
To come through the portal,
I think it has to be biological.

56:52.111 --> 56:54.883
- Why didn't you pick that up, huh?
- I don't know.

56:54.947 --> 56:57.351
- That's your job! That is your job!
- I don't know, okay?

56:57.417 --> 56:59.186
It's not giving off
anything I can pick up!

57:00.953 --> 57:02.055
I'm sorry.

57:04.557 --> 57:06.894
Whatever that thing is,
let's headed for the tunnel.

57:06.959 --> 57:09.531
Staggered formation, keep
your heads on a swivel,

57:09.595 --> 57:12.299
360 at all times,
watch your overheads

57:12.364 --> 57:14.301
and put rounds in
anything that moves.

57:14.366 --> 57:16.471
Let's go, come on.

57:27.180 --> 57:29.718
- Preston!
- I'm all right.

58:26.672 --> 58:28.575
Let's move!
Move move move!

58:30.376 --> 58:32.914
Come on! Go go go!

59:18.758 --> 59:20.862
- Gates!
- Clear!

59:20.927 --> 59:22.997
- Gates?
- Clear.

59:24.230 --> 59:25.666
Clear right.

59:25.731 --> 59:27.701
- Preston?
- Clear!

59:27.767 --> 59:29.069
All clear.

59:29.135 --> 59:31.339
Watch up top!

59:31.405 --> 59:33.675
What the fuck was that thing?

59:33.739 --> 59:35.742
Are you okay?

59:38.479 --> 59:41.585
Aw, no. No no no no no.

59:41.647 --> 59:44.719
- What's going on, doc?
- He's overloading the reactor.

59:44.784 --> 59:48.424
It's... it's gonna fracture.
This whole place is gonna implode.

59:48.489 --> 59:50.860
- Shut it down.
- I can't shut it down!

59:50.923 --> 59:52.960
All right,
how much time do we have?

59:54.827 --> 59:56.430
Nights on!

59:57.498 --> 01:00:00.035
There's no point.
He cut the power.

01:00:00.099 --> 01:00:02.369
- So what?
- So...

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:04.840
you don't understand.
We cannot open the door

01:00:04.904 --> 01:00:07.509
- without power.
- There's always a backup generator.

01:00:07.573 --> 01:00:09.075
You just gotta find it.

01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:11.479
Yes yes yes,
right there, right there.

01:00:11.544 --> 01:00:14.115
- That is a generator, I know it.
- It's far.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.618
- No, we can make it.
- We gotta move.

01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:18.519
No, listen listen.

01:00:18.584 --> 01:00:20.053
I'll get the power on.

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:22.491
- I'll meet you at this door right here.
- No no no.

01:00:22.555 --> 01:00:23.957
- We stay together.
- Do it.

01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:30.163
You got a problem?

01:00:30.229 --> 01:00:32.734
Are you sure you want
to split us up again?

01:00:32.798 --> 01:00:35.068
'Cause we're a lot more
effective together.

01:00:35.134 --> 01:00:37.271
We lost Ed, you saw what
happened to Preston...

01:00:37.336 --> 01:00:38.639
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:41.075
Fuck, think outside
of the fucking box!

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.743
God damn it!

01:00:45.011 --> 01:00:46.748
Listen to me very carefully.

01:00:48.214 --> 01:00:49.617
Right or wrong,

01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:51.986
I make the decisions
for this team.

01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:54.088
You follow orders

01:00:54.153 --> 01:00:55.956
or you're free to go on your way.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.127
Is that clear?

01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:03.063
Yeah.

01:01:03.129 --> 01:01:05.032
Okay.

01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:09.537
Do it.

01:01:09.602 --> 01:01:11.204
Let's go.

01:01:32.124 --> 01:01:34.027
I'm picking up something
coming in fast.

01:01:34.093 --> 01:01:36.130
- Where?
- It's right in front of us.

01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:39.033
It's closing.

01:01:39.098 --> 01:01:41.235
Put rounds on this
thing till it's down!

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.636
It's closing.

01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:44.838
It's closing!

01:01:44.904 --> 01:01:46.674
Wait wait, it's a female!

01:01:46.739 --> 01:01:48.876
Hold your fire! Cover.

01:01:48.941 --> 01:01:50.811
Covering.

01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:52.311
Stay down!

01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:53.681
Who are you?

01:01:53.746 --> 01:01:55.483
Alison? Alison!

01:01:56.716 --> 01:01:58.719
- Who is she, Whitmore?
- It's okay.

01:01:58.784 --> 01:02:01.923
- She's my daughter.
- It's all our fault.

01:02:01.988 --> 01:02:03.524
No, we did what we had to do.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.994
Check her out, Preston.

01:02:07.393 --> 01:02:08.896
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:10.564
10 seconds, Preston.

01:02:10.631 --> 01:02:12.668
Stick with me, yeah?

01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:14.735
Let's move. Move move!

01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:01.948
Watch your overhead!

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:14.729
Shh shh shh shh.
We'll get out of this, okay?

01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:18.432
Holding!

01:03:58.137 --> 01:03:59.507
Holding!

01:04:03.477 --> 01:04:05.379
- My dad is out there!
- Clear left!

01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:07.281
- Clear right.
- Cover!

01:04:07.346 --> 01:04:08.482
- Covering.
- Put your head down,

01:04:08.548 --> 01:04:11.620
put your head down. Okay,
get me some light over here.

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.622
- Yeah yeah.
- Some light.

01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:16.024
Okay, baby, okay okay okay.

01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:20.896
I... I can't pick up V anymore.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.697
What?

01:04:25.565 --> 01:04:27.334
V?

01:04:27.399 --> 01:04:29.403
V?

01:04:29.469 --> 01:04:32.842
V! V! V!

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.275
V!

01:04:51.223 --> 01:04:53.995
- V!
- Is he alive?

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:56.864
I... I don't know.

01:04:56.929 --> 01:04:58.732
You don't fucking know?

01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:01.504
I don't know!
I can barely pick up you guys.

01:05:02.769 --> 01:05:05.073
This is fucking bullshit.

01:05:05.137 --> 01:05:06.607
Get your shit together, Preston.

01:05:06.673 --> 01:05:09.044
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

01:05:09.108 --> 01:05:11.245
- You do your job!
- No no no, hold it.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.180
I dumped a whole magazine
into that fucker!

01:05:13.245 --> 01:05:15.148
So did I. I'm gonna
keep on doing that!

01:05:15.214 --> 01:05:18.186
- There's no rolling fucking dice!
- What options do we have?

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.653
Hey hey, shut the fuck up!

01:05:19.719 --> 01:05:22.558
Listen to me!
We can't beat it.

01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:25.726
We can avoid it though.

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:28.597
Now get the fuck down here and
hold this and I'll show you how.

01:05:32.064 --> 01:05:33.700
- You got it?
- Yeah, I think.

01:05:37.203 --> 01:05:38.906
This tunnel, right here,

01:05:38.971 --> 01:05:40.908
that can't be more
than a few feet wide.

01:05:40.973 --> 01:05:42.976
I don't think that thing
can fit through it.

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:46.482
But if he does, we can focus all
firepower into one direction.

01:05:46.546 --> 01:05:48.248
All right?

01:05:48.314 --> 01:05:50.619
Now it's gonna drop us
just shy of the door.

01:05:50.684 --> 01:05:53.321
- You see that?
- Good idea.

01:05:53.385 --> 01:05:55.456
Preston, can she move?

01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:57.993
She has to. Yeah.

01:05:58.057 --> 01:06:00.562
- All right.
- Gatesy, help me out with her.

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:02.731
Three, two, one.

01:06:16.008 --> 01:06:17.611
Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:19.179
- All right, clear.
- Clear!

01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:21.415
Go go go go!

01:06:23.282 --> 01:06:24.585
Lead on.

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:44.237
Stay with me.

01:06:47.006 --> 01:06:49.076
Okay.

01:06:50.911 --> 01:06:52.213
Hey!

01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:57.352
- I can't.
- Come on, stay with me.

01:06:59.519 --> 01:07:01.188
I can't.

01:07:15.902 --> 01:07:18.474
Sweetie, are you all right?

01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:20.775
- Preston?
- Just wait!

01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:24.211
I wanna see my dad.

01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:26.648
Where is my dad?

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:29.084
It's all right.
You're gonna see him soon.

01:08:12.525 --> 01:08:13.760
Hey, I'm here.

01:08:13.827 --> 01:08:16.131
- Good boy.
- V, you're a beauty.

01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:18.198
Good to hear your voice, V.
What's your status?

01:08:18.263 --> 01:08:20.300
I'm good.
Found a way around.

01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:21.902
I'll be there soon.

01:08:21.968 --> 01:08:23.236
Hustle. We're close.

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:27.874
Fuck, the reactor!

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:29.810
Get the fuck out of here!
Come on, move!

01:08:32.845 --> 01:08:34.448
Watch your top. Watch it.

01:08:34.514 --> 01:08:36.818
- Preston, with me.
- Open left, over left.

01:08:36.883 --> 01:08:38.752
On me, watch out.

01:08:38.818 --> 01:08:40.787
Come on, come on!

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:42.624
- Clear left!
- It's not working!

01:08:44.223 --> 01:08:46.895
- It's not working!
- Check for a manual override.

01:08:51.031 --> 01:08:52.133
Here we go, here we go.

01:08:52.197 --> 01:08:53.633
I think I've got it.

01:08:56.368 --> 01:08:57.636
This is it.

01:09:01.173 --> 01:09:02.776
Yes!
Yeah, that's it!

01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:04.912
That's it!

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:11.920
Heep going, Preston.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.785
Move!

01:10:02.435 --> 01:10:04.204
Get this fucking thing open.

01:11:28.988 --> 01:11:30.290
I got you.

01:11:32.058 --> 01:11:35.097
V! Nice fucking shot.

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.173
Oh fuck.

01:11:47.239 --> 01:11:49.611
Come on, we gotta get the
fuck out of here, come on.

01:11:49.676 --> 01:11:51.980
How many rounds you got?

01:11:52.045 --> 01:11:54.315
Gates, how many rounds?!

01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:56.584
Nothing, I'm out.
I only got one clip of .45s.

01:11:56.649 --> 01:11:58.251
Shit.

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:04.958
Preston, let's go.

01:12:08.094 --> 01:12:10.097
Preston!

01:12:10.163 --> 01:12:12.166
Preston's dead.
We've gotta go.

01:12:12.232 --> 01:12:14.336
Preston!

01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:16.403
He's gone!

01:12:16.469 --> 01:12:18.773
Preston, Preston!

01:12:18.838 --> 01:12:20.641
Go go! Go go go go!

01:12:20.707 --> 01:12:21.975
You go first. Go go go!

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:23.978
Hurry, get the fuck out of here.
Fuck!

01:12:24.043 --> 01:12:25.446
Come on, Locke.
Come on.

01:12:33.686 --> 01:12:34.888
Locke! Gates,

01:12:34.954 --> 01:12:36.557
get some slugs over here.

01:12:36.623 --> 01:12:39.829
What the fuck?
Shoot, man, shoot.

01:12:39.892 --> 01:12:41.294
Fuck.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.397
What the fuck? Come on!

01:12:43.463 --> 01:12:45.299
I'm out.

01:12:47.433 --> 01:12:49.035
Shit!

01:12:49.102 --> 01:12:50.405
Get the fuck out of here.

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:52.239
Get the fuck out of here!

01:12:53.706 --> 01:12:55.208
What the fuck are you doing?

01:12:55.275 --> 01:12:58.247
- No no.
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:00.380
- Gates, fucking go.
- No no no.

01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:03.350
Fucking go, fucking go!

01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:05.185
- Get the fuck...
- Fuck!

01:14:59.399 --> 01:15:02.037
This changes nothing, you know.

01:15:08.975 --> 01:15:12.549
And that wasn't my only
base of operations.

01:15:14.313 --> 01:15:16.718
Talent just tells me that you can.

01:15:18.651 --> 01:15:21.990
What concerns me is if you will.
