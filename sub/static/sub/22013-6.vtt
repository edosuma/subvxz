WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.890
-Previously on Empire...
-Angelo is here as my attorney.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.159
-I am suing for sole custody
of Bella. -I need your word

00:25.193 --> 00:27.661
you're not gonna try to take
my baby away from me again.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.597
Any more twisted relationships
between your two families?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.365
I've been bringing Bella to you
for the last five months

00:31.399 --> 00:33.834
every Tuesday and I still don't
know what you want from me.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.270
-I can't lose Bella, Mom.
-And I can't lose you.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.706
-I did some things. -I don't
care what you did, Hakeem.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.075
I'm leaving Empire.
I negotiated for you

00:41.109 --> 00:43.677
-to come with me.
-Who asked you to do that?

00:43.711 --> 00:47.515
-Lucious is gone. It's Dwight.
-No, my name is Lucious.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.017
My office will send you a check.
You may leave now.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.785
I'm back.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
* Oh

00:55.589 --> 00:57.358
* Ain't nobody

00:57.391 --> 00:58.792
* No business

00:58.826 --> 01:00.761
* If I'm hooked on you

01:00.794 --> 01:02.730
-* And keep comin' back
-* No

01:02.763 --> 01:04.565
* No, nicotine

01:04.598 --> 01:06.700
* In cigarettes

01:06.734 --> 01:08.702
* Ain't got nothin' on you

01:08.736 --> 01:09.903
* You help me relax

01:09.937 --> 01:13.241
* It's unbelievable

01:13.274 --> 01:15.743
* How good you make me feel

01:15.776 --> 01:17.044
* Damn

01:17.077 --> 01:20.614
* You should be illegal

01:20.648 --> 01:22.583
* Baby, my lips are sealed

01:22.616 --> 01:24.252
* I know it's real

01:24.285 --> 01:26.454
* I know the deal,
'cause love... *

01:26.487 --> 01:29.390
-That's amazing. Come on in.
-All right. (chuckles)

01:29.423 --> 01:32.059
* Uh, uh, uh, uh

01:32.092 --> 01:33.594
* He got a voice,
the boy can sing *

01:33.627 --> 01:34.762
Come on, singer.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.230
You sure? Come on,
you know I usually warm up

01:36.264 --> 01:38.132
-a lot more than that.
-TONY: Nah, listen,

01:38.166 --> 01:39.967
you sound great, man. It's just
a scratch vocal, anyway.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.069
And all of the horrendous parts,
we're just gonna

01:42.102 --> 01:43.070
put some Auto-Tune on them.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.572
Come on.
Everybody ain't Jamal.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.939
(laughs)

01:45.973 --> 01:48.276
But seriously, why don't you...

01:48.309 --> 01:50.678
just do the duet?
Be on the track.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.646
'Cause I'm not an artist;
I'm an amateur,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.282
and you need a real artist
on this song.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.450
I think homeboy just scared.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.086
He about to fall up
in this-this music life.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.521
-He's gonna leave everything
behind. -All right,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.323
-Dr. Freud.
-Don't-don't matter.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.193
-Don't-don't get wrapped up.
Wait, hold up. -(phone chimes)

02:07.628 --> 02:09.430
Y'all stay at it, all right?
That's my mom.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.165
I got to go to Hakeem's
custody hearing, all right?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.866
-All right, baby.
-All right, man.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.339
DR. LAMBERT: I know
patients are often reticent

02:18.372 --> 02:20.040
with new therapists,

02:20.073 --> 02:24.245
but... I can't help you
if you're holding back.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.649
(sighs)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.951
Um...

02:30.984 --> 02:33.221
I, uh...

02:33.254 --> 02:34.988
I started seeing somebody.

02:35.022 --> 02:38.492
A woman. Her name is, um...

02:38.526 --> 02:40.794
Pamela.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.397
That's wonderful.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.633
Yeah, it's wonderful.
She's wonderful, doc.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.402
Only, uh, she's a cop.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.472
NYPD, and my family

02:51.505 --> 02:54.342
has a pretty dicey relationship
with folks in law enforcement,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.245
so that's probably not gonna
work out so well, right?

02:57.278 --> 03:00.848
Do you mistrust her? You-you
think she's working an angle?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.350
I don't, I don't know.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.984
I don't know.
I just, I just...

03:04.017 --> 03:06.019
I just know I can't stop
thinking about her.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.156
I can't stop thinking about her.
(laughs)

03:09.189 --> 03:10.891
And-and, Dr. Lambert,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.693
I-I want to call her.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.161
I want to call her.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.996
Yeah, I want to--
I want to call her.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.366
I want to talk to her.
I need to talk to her, and I...

03:18.399 --> 03:19.867
I don't know if that
makes me foolish.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.369
I don't know if that
makes me crazy. (laughs)

03:21.402 --> 03:23.671
-I don't-- I'm spinning.
-Andre, slow down.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.839
You're moving a mile a minute.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.410
And now I have to cut this short
because I have to get to...

03:29.443 --> 03:32.179
get downtown to my brother's
kid's custody hearing, so...

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
All right, wait.

03:34.248 --> 03:37.117
I'm going to renew
your prescription,

03:37.150 --> 03:39.987
and you can get this filled
on your way to the courthouse.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.259
Thank you, doc.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.728
This way.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.730
(sighs)

03:49.763 --> 03:52.766
Y'all realize that's an original
Klimt and not a print, right?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.468
Please be careful.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.070
-Little better.
-Okay, thank you, gentlemen.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.907
We got to go to court, okay?
But it's good to see the house

03:59.940 --> 04:02.710
-getting back to itself.
-Yeah.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.313
-Y'all look perfect. Come on.
-He seems...

04:05.346 --> 04:08.048
-Yeah, back to normal.
-So he's back.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.318
-COOKIE: I really hope so.
-Yes, I'm back,

04:10.351 --> 04:12.553
so stop talking about me
like I'm not here.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.155
JUANITA:
Mr. Hakeem?

04:15.188 --> 04:16.624
I'm praying for you.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.459
Thank you, Juanita.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.397
Come on. Out of the way, people.
Come on, back up.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.600
-Stand back. -Move out of the
way. -Let these people breathe.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.902
-Come on, back up. -SHEPHERD:
How you doing, Cookie?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.171
-Hey. -Ignore all this,
and pay attention.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.774
It's gonna get ugly in there.
Don't let it get to you.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.310
I'm telling you, calm and cool
is the way to win this.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.512
Exactly. Today,
we are the royal family,

04:38.546 --> 04:40.481
so everybody,
get your feelings in check.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.616
-Let's go in here and win this
for Bella. -Strictly business.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.851
What's today mean for you,
Hakeem?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.919
Everything.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.288
Come on, boy.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.324
*

04:55.329 --> 04:57.965
WOMAN:
You got this, Hakeem!

05:00.468 --> 05:02.603
ANGELO: Okay, why don't
you step over here?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.338
-I'll catch up with you.
-COOKIE: Angelo.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.974
(sighs)

05:07.007 --> 05:09.677
Your mother and I have put
our differences aside.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.212
I think its time for us to put
an end to this petty feud.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.782
Cookie Lyon.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.983
Peace advocate.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.651
Nice try.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.587
But I'm not my mother.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.656
-Good luck.
-Mm.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.291
Yeah, well, you sure do
have bitch tendencies.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.693
Very classy.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.628
Always.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.663
(sighs)

05:35.035 --> 05:36.737
BAILIFF:
All rise.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.474
District Three family court
is in session.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.343
Honorable Judge Lydia Barnes
presiding.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.880
Please be seated.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.318
All cameras gone. Now.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.087
-(crowd protests)
-(gavel banging)

05:54.121 --> 05:55.255
Cameras out, please.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.857
All right, buddy.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.326
And if anybody brought a sign in
here, I don't want to see it.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.831
First person to give me
a lecture on freedom of speech

06:03.864 --> 06:08.436
can have a free stay in my
"contempt of court" jail cell.

06:08.469 --> 06:12.205
These proceedings
are about the fate of a baby.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.342
Anything less is frivolous.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.210
Preach!

06:17.244 --> 06:20.748
I do not speak hood.

06:20.781 --> 06:21.849
(scattered laughter)

06:21.882 --> 06:23.851
No class.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.352
JUDGE BARNES:
Enough.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.289
I've presided over
thousands of custody cases,

06:29.322 --> 06:31.625
and in my practiced opinion,

06:31.659 --> 06:36.530
very few parents impress me
as being remotely worthy

06:36.564 --> 06:38.599
of raising a child.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.602
Let's let today
change that opinion.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.437
Free Bella Lyon!

06:43.471 --> 06:46.139
You, out.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.441
-All right, you, let's go.
-Hey.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.242
Hey, yo. Get off me, man.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.811
Hey. Let go!

06:50.844 --> 06:53.447
It appears this circus
has lost one clown,

06:53.481 --> 06:54.882
so let's get on with it.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.183
Petitioner?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.319
Mr. Dubois.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
My regards to your mother.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.923
-What? -ANGELO: Yes, thank you,
Your Honor.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.958
She's, uh, currently
in Gstaad for the week.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.794
With the Carsons, actually.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.429
Please, proceed, Mr. Dubois.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.633
Your Honor, my client,
Anika Calhoun,

07:12.666 --> 07:16.169
is the natural mother
of Bella Lyon.

07:16.203 --> 07:20.073
She comes from a-a stable
and law-abiding family,

07:20.107 --> 07:24.645
and she's supported
by a very educated,

07:24.678 --> 07:28.816
and a, uh, a loving community.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.753
Now, the baby's father,

07:32.786 --> 07:36.857
Hakeem Lyon,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.259
is an aspiring hip-hop playboy.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.629
B-level, at best.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.598
He's immature, unstable,

07:44.632 --> 07:46.433
hedonistic,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.301
sexually licentious

07:48.335 --> 07:50.370
and is an avid drug abuser.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.873
-(whispers): Lies.
-When is he gonna object?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.875
It's his opening statement.
He can say whatever he wants.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.476
Objections only happen
during testimony.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.946
Now, the Lyons, as a family,

07:58.979 --> 08:04.652
are a group of opportunistic
no-collar criminals masquerading

08:04.685 --> 08:06.987
as a music company,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.356
with Lucious and Cookie Lyon

08:09.389 --> 08:12.325
as the violent,
lawless kingpins.

08:12.359 --> 08:16.363
I like to call them
"hip-hop's Bonnie and Clyde."

08:16.396 --> 08:18.398
I think that's cute.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.068
Your Honor,
it is my client's belief that,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.904
left under Hakeem Lyon's
custody,

08:23.937 --> 08:27.374
this child will either
end up injured,

08:27.407 --> 08:31.411
damaged or dead.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.080
-(gallery murmuring)
-Thank you.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.048
Bring out the blades, bitches,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.584
'cause he coming for blood.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.591
ANIKA: Yes, it is true that
I did not expect a pregnancy,

08:43.624 --> 08:46.594
but when it happened, I...

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
I realized
it was something I wanted

08:48.762 --> 08:51.064
more than anything
in this world.

08:51.098 --> 08:55.002
Except for Lucious's money,
and Hakeem's ding-a-ling.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.870
When Anika had Bella,
all she did was complain

08:56.904 --> 08:58.438
Bella was cramping her style.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.507
Then she went to jail.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.042
Now Bella don't even know her.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.777
I'm who Bella knows.

09:03.811 --> 09:08.115
Unfortunately, Hakeem does not
know good parenting,

09:08.148 --> 09:11.118
because he's never
had it himself.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.020
Bitch.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.922
Mistakes? Yeah, I made some.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.690
But I never lost her,

09:16.724 --> 09:18.892
dropped her or abandoned her.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.361
You've spent half
of Bella's life in jail.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.631
For what charge?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.769
Murder.
(clears throat)

09:28.802 --> 09:30.070
-(gallery murmuring)
-But it was self-defense,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.439
and the charges were dropped.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.775
You had sex with the son
of the man you were married to.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.276
Your-your own stepson.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.878
ANIKA:
We were not married.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.279
Yet.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.314
And I was just...

09:41.348 --> 09:42.916
-Sleeping together?
-Objection.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.619
-Sustained.
-It is not what it sounds like.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.921
It sounds like you a ho.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.623
I had to take
a paternity test to know

09:49.657 --> 09:50.891
if Bella was my daughter,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
my sister
or community property.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.563
-Clap that, bitch!
-JUDGE BARNES: Ms. Lyon,

09:56.596 --> 10:00.233
I've put up with your murmurs
and your not-so sotto voce,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.469
but one more transgression,

10:02.502 --> 10:05.739
and you'll be
under this court, not in it.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.140
Am I clear?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.643
Yes, Your Honor. My apologies.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.179
Accepted.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.948
Five-minute recess.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.483
JAMAL:
Yeah, no.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.118
I love what you did
with the bridge. Just, um,

10:18.151 --> 10:20.453
send me the final mix.
I'll get you notes by tomorrow.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.323
Look, I don't care
what you got to do.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.492
Get the mixes done
before I get back, all right?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.360
I don't care what you have
to reschedule, Becky.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.930
-Just get it done.
-I just got off with J Poppa.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.966
He wants to re-sign with Empire,
if he can get a 20 For 20 slot.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.935
That is brilliant. I'll have
Porsha set up the meeting.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.670
Oh, no. I can
take care of it, Ma.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.672
Me and J Poppa go back
to Gutter Life days.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.707
That's right.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.874
BAILIFF:
Court is reconvened.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.678
Let's go.

10:46.714 --> 10:50.884
Being a father made Hakeem
take life seriously.

10:50.918 --> 10:54.121
I watched my little brother
become a man.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.557
Anika is so kind and thoughtful.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.292
I named my daughter after her.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.395
She's everything
all of us wanted to be.

11:02.429 --> 11:06.033
There's just been
a huge change in Hakeem.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.569
You know, I see him
reading books like,

11:09.602 --> 11:11.739
What to Expect
in the First Six Months.

11:11.772 --> 11:15.242
You know, he's...
he's very dedicated.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.045
My daughter won the good citizen
award in high school.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.880
We raised her right.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.050
Keem's a superstar.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.886
There are always
women after him,

11:25.919 --> 11:28.488
but the one girl that stole

11:28.521 --> 11:32.860
his heart and mind
is little baby Bella.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.029
He changed
his whole life for her.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.532
She's his everything.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.769
-(gallery murmuring)
-SHEPHERD: That's all.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.738
Thank you.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.740
ANGELO:
Uh, how long

11:46.774 --> 11:49.109
have you been living with Hakeem

11:49.142 --> 11:52.880
in his Gramercy Park penthouse?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.714
About five months.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.117
Okay.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.286
Ballpark figure-- how many times

11:59.319 --> 12:01.922
-have you had sexual threesomes
in that... -(gallery murmuring)

12:01.955 --> 12:03.256
...marble Jacuzzi that's right

12:03.290 --> 12:04.724
in the middle
of his living room?

12:04.758 --> 12:07.394
-Objection.
-Uh, withdrawn. How many times

12:07.427 --> 12:09.396
have you done drugs
with him there?

12:09.429 --> 12:10.730
-SHEPHERD: Objection.
-I never did drugs.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.365
Was it Monday through Friday,
or was it just

12:12.399 --> 12:13.533
-the weekends? -SHEPHERD:
Objection. Your Honor.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.968
-And no.
-What kind of drugs did you do?

12:15.002 --> 12:16.937
-Objection! -Was it cocaine?
-I never did drugs.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.906
-Was it crack? Oh, come on,
what? What is it? -Objection!

12:18.939 --> 12:20.573
-Kids are popping Molly
these days. -He's objecting.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.475
Where was Bella when all this
was happening, huh?

12:22.509 --> 12:23.743
-JUDGE BARNES: Counselor Dubois!
-Where was Bella? -I don't know!

12:23.777 --> 12:25.145
-Was she asleep in her crib...
-(gavel banging)

12:25.178 --> 12:27.447
-...when you guys were having
silent sex parties? -Mr. Dubois.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.748
Sniffing cocaine off of
each other's body parts?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.217
-I don't know! I don't know!
-Mr. Dubois!

12:30.250 --> 12:34.254
-Where was Bella? Where was...?
-Mr. Dubois!

12:34.287 --> 12:39.459
-This is a witness, not
a punching bag. -(Tiana crying)

12:43.797 --> 12:45.398
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.600
JUDGE BARNES:
I just bet you are.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.437
Court recessed until Thursday.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.407
-(gavel bangs) -Somebody help
this little girl off the stand.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.010
(Tiana crying,
gallery chattering)

13:00.180 --> 13:01.748
That was awful.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.817
-He just kept attacking me.
-Why didn't you

13:03.851 --> 13:06.153
fight back instead
of crying like some punk?

13:06.186 --> 13:07.587
Instead, I may lose Bella,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.923
because you were too weak
to fight for her!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.324
That's not fair.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.127
I love Bella.
Hakeem, you know that.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.528
It's your fault
why I'm even up in here

13:15.562 --> 13:18.198
in the first place
instead of Cuba.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.432
I should have dropped your ass
when you

13:19.466 --> 13:20.500
snitched on me to Cookie.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.438
You're stressed
out of your mind right now,

13:25.472 --> 13:28.976
but I deserve better.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.710
So when you get your brain back,

13:30.743 --> 13:33.480
and you start looking for me...

13:33.513 --> 13:35.748
don't.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.862
I just want to make sure
I'm able to reach my whole

13:48.896 --> 13:50.830
-core demographic. -Yeah.
-ANDRE: To answer your question,

13:50.864 --> 13:52.332
it's a...

13:53.833 --> 13:55.668
Have a seat.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.211
You remember J Poppa, don't you?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.215
How you doin', Becky?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.383
Welcome back.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.185
ANDRE:
Shine's gonna produce J Poppa's

14:12.219 --> 14:14.087
first single
for his 20 For 20 album.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.056
What you know
about Christian music?

14:16.089 --> 14:19.359
I've been known to catch the
Holy Ghost from time to time.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.895
ANDRE:
Yeah, Cookie wants you

14:21.929 --> 14:23.230
to, uh,
find some other producers

14:23.263 --> 14:25.065
for him to work with
to mix it up.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.335
Can you handle that?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.270
I'm right on top of that.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.440
Good, and, um,

14:33.473 --> 14:36.609
I hope that we can count
on you two to be professional.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.249
Hope so.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.320
-See you.
-Have a nice night.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.457
J POPPA:
So...

14:50.490 --> 14:52.792
head of A&R.

14:55.128 --> 14:59.099
Yeah, the job
you said I'd never get.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.902
Well... congratulations.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.471
Mm-hmm.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.940
I can tell
you almost meant that.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.643
I'll see you in the studio.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.748
* Uh, all I need is a girl
in my life *

15:15.782 --> 15:18.551
* That ain't out of my league,
everything is just right *

15:18.585 --> 15:20.487
* Thank the man in the sky

15:20.520 --> 15:22.822
* 'Cause He know what I need,
I need a lady with morals *

15:22.855 --> 15:24.324
* And not someone
in the streets *

15:24.357 --> 15:25.758
* I need somebody that's sweet

15:25.792 --> 15:27.294
* Somebody to pray with me

15:27.327 --> 15:28.728
* No tricks up they sleeve

15:28.761 --> 15:30.130
* Just wantin'
to play with me *

15:30.163 --> 15:31.664
* I'm a changed man

15:31.698 --> 15:33.933
* I need a girl
to respect that *

15:33.967 --> 15:36.069
-* Respect that
-* Somebody to check that

15:36.103 --> 15:37.937
* Around the block
a few times I been *

15:37.971 --> 15:40.107
* But now I'm trying
to post up *

15:40.140 --> 15:42.675
* On fresh new land,
and be a brand-new man... *

15:42.709 --> 15:44.577
I'm usually not
into this Jesus stuff,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.813
but my man got something here.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.782
-It's hot. -* No more
slick talk 'bout gunplay *

15:49.816 --> 15:52.752
-* Now I got my hands raised
at church on Sundays * -God.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.521
* Poppa knows better,
and better is you *

15:54.554 --> 15:56.489
* I've weathered a few storms
that had led me to you *

15:56.523 --> 15:58.258
Can y'all cut it?
Cut it. Cut it.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.360
-* Hey, man, I need a...
-(music stops)

16:00.393 --> 16:02.962
-Let me hear it from the top.
-(clicks tongue) Becky,

16:02.996 --> 16:04.531
if you don't mind,
we almost done.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.799
-We have... -I do mind.
I'm overseeing this album,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.701
and I would like to hear
what y'all are working on.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.137
(sighs)

16:10.170 --> 16:12.105
Take two.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.174
I'm-a playback.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.643
* All I need is a girl
in my life *

16:16.676 --> 16:19.046
* That ain't out of my league,
everything is just right *

16:19.079 --> 16:22.049
* Thank the man in the sky
'cause He know what I need *

16:22.082 --> 16:23.683
* I need a lady with morals...

16:23.716 --> 16:25.785
-(music stops)
-Um...

16:25.818 --> 16:28.821
it sounds a little too much
like your last album.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.558
You mean my last platinum album?

16:31.591 --> 16:36.029
Cute. No, I mean, we get it.
You love the Lord,

16:36.063 --> 16:37.530
and you love
a good Christian girl,

16:37.564 --> 16:39.132
blah, blah, blah,
but you're back

16:39.166 --> 16:41.468
at Empire now, so I'm gonna need
you to break new ground.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.902
Do you want a hit record,

16:42.935 --> 16:44.704
or do you want
to continue your power trip?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.407
(chuckles)

16:47.440 --> 16:49.509
Shine, clear the room?

16:49.542 --> 16:52.512
You got to be kidding me.
Oh, hey, can I get you

16:52.545 --> 16:54.981
-anything from the kitchen
while I'm out? -I'm good.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.117
I'm just kidding.
Hurry up! I got work to do.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.188
(door closes)

17:01.221 --> 17:02.722
Come out here.
I'm not gonna talk to you

17:02.755 --> 17:05.024
through the glass
like a bank teller.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.133
(J Poppa sighs)

17:16.103 --> 17:17.937
(door opens)

17:19.939 --> 17:22.242
I'm so glad
to have you back at Empire

17:22.275 --> 17:25.512
making us hits and money,
but what you won't do

17:25.545 --> 17:28.081
is talk to me like I'm one
of your little fans out here,

17:28.115 --> 17:30.350
especially in front of Shine.
Is that clear?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.352
Only thing that's clear
is your jealousy.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.753
(laughs)

17:33.786 --> 17:35.288
Jealousy of what?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.390
-I moved on.
-Oh.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.626
I sold millions of records,
I traveled the world,

17:39.659 --> 17:42.429
and then you...
were still stuck here.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.932
Stuck? Who's stuck? You the one
that gave me an ultimatum,

17:45.965 --> 17:48.368
and when I didn't
quit my job for you,

17:48.401 --> 17:51.938
you dumped me,
and now I run this bitch.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.907
-(chuckles)
-What is so funny?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.946
I forgot how cute you are
when you get mad.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.783
-Ugh.
-Mmm.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.985
Stop. S...

18:08.255 --> 18:12.692
BECKY:
Mmm. Mmm.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.570
JUDGE BARNES:
Ms. Lyon.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.174
If your testimony
is half as colorful

18:27.207 --> 18:29.742
as your comments
I wasn't meant to hear,

18:29.776 --> 18:31.344
you just might make my day.

18:31.378 --> 18:34.781
Mr. Shepherd, your witness.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.183
(man coughs)

18:36.216 --> 18:38.418
Ms. Lyon.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.353
What do you do for a living?

18:40.387 --> 18:44.457
I am co-CEO
of Empire Entertainment.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.860
It's a multimillion dollar
music and entertainment company.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.629
And have you always
been in music?

18:49.662 --> 18:53.500
Yes. Uh, just not
at this high level.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.502
(clears throat)

18:55.535 --> 18:58.871
Before I came
to this position in Empire,

18:58.905 --> 19:02.175
I... I spent 17 years in prison.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.045
(gallery murmuring)

19:06.078 --> 19:08.181
Mm-mm.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.949
Look, I made some mistakes

19:09.982 --> 19:13.686
trying to make
my dreams come true,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.155
and I paid heavily for them.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.828
I had to raise my kids
from prison.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.201
Especially Hakeem.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.404
He was just a baby.

19:31.438 --> 19:36.709
And I see him giving
his baby girl all the love

19:36.743 --> 19:41.848
that I... wanted to give him,
but I couldn't.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.355
He's a father now,
and a good parent.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.357
He is...

19:51.891 --> 19:54.927
...better than, uh,
what I had a chance to be.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.701
Your husband divorced you
while you were in jail

20:01.734 --> 20:03.736
to marry Ms. Calhoun, correct?

20:03.770 --> 20:06.373
Not exactly.
He was dating someone else.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.840
Ms. Calhoun came later.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.041
ANGELO:
Okay, either way.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.777
Weren't you upset

20:10.810 --> 20:13.012
when you were kind of
kicked to the side

20:13.045 --> 20:15.682
for a "younger, prettier woman"?

20:15.715 --> 20:16.783
-(laughs)
-ANGELO: Yeah?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.785
Well, how about when

20:18.818 --> 20:20.287
that younger, prettier woman

20:20.320 --> 20:23.222
gave birth
to your first grandchild?

20:23.256 --> 20:25.858
Did that upset you?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.294
Did you...
(chuckles)

20:27.327 --> 20:29.228
Did you ever even consider

20:29.262 --> 20:31.898
harming baby Bella
just to get back at Ms. Calhoun?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.266
COOKIE:
Uh, no.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.102
Absolutely not.
Bella is my blood. Okay?

20:36.135 --> 20:39.939
Nothing or no one
could make me harm my own...

20:39.972 --> 20:41.974
But you are a violent woman,
because your prison dossier says

20:42.008 --> 20:44.444
that you were involved
in numerous altercations,

20:44.477 --> 20:46.279
and that you were
sent to solitary

20:46.313 --> 20:49.382
for... for
"many violent incidents."

20:49.416 --> 20:50.783
COOKIE:
Yeah, it's prison.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.251
You do what you got to do
to survive.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.287
Right. Have you ever
threatened Ms. Calhoun?

20:55.655 --> 20:57.624
As I recall,
we threatened each other.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.126
I mean, but those are
just words. We're still here.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.595
Is it true that
you slapped her, hit her,

21:02.629 --> 21:05.965
pulled her hair
and threatened her life?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.801
Yeah, we got into a fight.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.438
It takes two to tango,
and that was before the baby.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.939
Your point?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.641
Oh, okay.
So now that the baby's here,

21:14.674 --> 21:16.309
you can physically abuse her?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.445
-Objection. -Sustained.
-Is that what you're saying?

21:18.478 --> 21:19.812
-ANGELO: Wait. -Come on.
-WOMAN: Why'd he say that?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.147
WOMAN:
That's not right.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.248
Okay, look.
(chuckles)

21:22.281 --> 21:23.683
Everyone in here knows

21:23.716 --> 21:25.752
that Anika and I got off
to a rough start.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.121
Okay? I get home from prison,
she's engaged to my husband,

21:29.155 --> 21:33.460
living in my house,
living my dream.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.694
So you were upset?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.663
We grew up.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.197
Ah. Grew up.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.766
I guess she didn't tell you
about the time

21:39.799 --> 21:42.502
that I talked her down
from the ledge

21:42.535 --> 21:44.170
she was going to jump from?

21:44.203 --> 21:45.772
With Bella in her belly?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.441
-(chuckles) I'm sorry?
-Mm?

21:48.475 --> 21:51.310
Yeah, she didn't tell you that
when she feared for her life,

21:51.344 --> 21:53.613
she came to me to ask
that I take care of Bella,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.482
in case something
happened to her.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.951
Forgot to mention that part
to your lawyer, huh?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.553
Why don't we just stick
to the question, 'cause...

22:00.587 --> 22:02.789
-You didn't tell your lawyer
that? -The questions, like:

22:02.822 --> 22:05.792
isn't it true that you
pistol-whipped me?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.059
-Mr. Dubois.
-Objection.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.060
-Irrelevant.
-Answer the question.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.129
Is it true that
you had your thugs...

22:10.162 --> 22:12.699
-What? -...beat me
to a bloody pulp? What about...

22:12.732 --> 22:14.066
-Mr. Dubois.
-Y'all didn't know about that.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.201
Is she fit to raise a child?

22:15.234 --> 22:16.403
Mr. Dubois.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.206
Do you want
to pistol-whip me now?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.708
-Is that you want?
-Mm-hmm.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.476
-Leave my mama alone!
-Hakeem.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.144
It's your fault why we even
in this in the first place.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.312
-Your Honor, please.
Look at him. -Hakeem, don't let

22:26.345 --> 22:28.548
-him push your buttons.
-JUDGE BARNES: All right.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.550
Stop the drama. Enough.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.152
Or I'll have you living
in my jail cell

22:33.185 --> 22:37.356
until Bella is of the age
to reject both of you.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.761
Mr. Dubois.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.095
Your fangs are showing.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.431
(laughs)

22:44.464 --> 22:45.632
Please excuse me, Your Honor.

22:47.299 --> 22:50.670
-(gavel bangs) -JUDGE BARNES:
Ten minute recess.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.939
All right, to hell
with all this BS, counselor.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.441
-Put me on the stand.
-No, Lucious...

22:54.474 --> 22:57.209
-What? -Lucious, no.
-No... No. What? I mean,

22:57.243 --> 22:58.945
are you gonna let that man
just talk to her that way

22:58.978 --> 23:00.413
-without a rebuttal?
-Lucious, I get it,

23:00.447 --> 23:02.415
-but at the end of the day,
we have to... -ANDRE: Pop.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.084
Pop, that's probably
not the best idea.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.553
I-- look, I...
(chuckles)

23:06.586 --> 23:08.588
I know you think
you're back to being Lucious,

23:08.621 --> 23:11.023
but that could be dangerous.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.026
Angelo has a lot of information,
and he could use it against us.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.862
JAMAL: Yeah, Mom's right, Dad.
And he knows exactly

23:15.895 --> 23:17.897
-what he's doing. -LUCIOUS:
Yeah, well, I know what

23:17.930 --> 23:21.468
I'm doing, too.
Y'all got to trust me on this.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.202
Hakeem, what do you
want to do, man?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.071
It's your daughter.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.373
I trust you, Dad.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.576
Right on. Come on.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.911
And this is the real Lucious
we're talking about, now?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.746
I don't know.

23:39.018 --> 23:42.421
Mr. Dubois, your witness.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.091
ANGELO:
Mr. Lyon. In 2013,

23:45.124 --> 23:47.994
Rolling Stone magazine
named you

23:48.027 --> 23:52.398
"The Scariest Man in Music."

23:52.431 --> 23:54.667
Why?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.710
I don't know.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.980
COOKIE: He knows exactly
what he's doing.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.785
Let me refresh your memory.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.455
It's because you are known
to have affiliations

24:16.489 --> 24:18.491
with hardened criminals,

24:18.525 --> 24:20.793
and anyone who ever disputed you

24:20.827 --> 24:24.497
would either disappear,
or end up dead.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.633
-Objection. Hearsay.
-JUDGE BARNES: Sustained.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.840
I guess I used to be
a scary person.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.307
You guess?

24:35.341 --> 24:39.879
Um, I might have...
done some things,

24:39.912 --> 24:42.882
and hurt a lot of people.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.984
Somebody tried to blow me up.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.819
I don't know why.

24:46.853 --> 24:50.623
But since the accident, I don't
really remember everything.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.992
Well, isn't that convenient?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.194
Ever since the accident,

24:55.227 --> 24:57.163
he doesn't remember
all of the evil,

24:57.196 --> 24:59.398
awful, terrible things
that he did...

24:59.431 --> 25:00.633
-Objection.
-JUDGE BARNES: Sustained.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.735
It's all right, Your Honor.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.672
He's... he's right.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.708
You know? Uh...
(exhales)

25:08.741 --> 25:10.810
It's a terrible thing,
not to remember.

25:10.843 --> 25:15.815
And Mr. Dubois, I mean, if you
know something about my past

25:15.848 --> 25:18.885
that you would like
to share with me, um,

25:18.918 --> 25:20.687
we could talk after the hearing,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.756
but I thought
this was about Bella.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.758
-This is about Bella, yes.
I'm... -I remember Bella.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.794
I know Bella.

25:29.361 --> 25:33.032
And I know that my son,
Hakeem Lyon,

25:33.065 --> 25:35.067
is a wonderful parent,

25:35.101 --> 25:38.705
because I've watched him
care for her.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.372
I've watched him love her,

25:40.406 --> 25:43.943
and... and I love her.

25:43.976 --> 25:48.414
I love her so much I don't know
what we'll do if we lose her.

25:48.447 --> 25:52.351
I mean, that little girl, she's
given me so many new memories,

25:52.384 --> 25:54.687
and, um...

25:54.721 --> 25:59.759
given me a reason
to want to try and-and heal.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.598
Are you okay, son?

26:05.632 --> 26:10.169
-You have any more questions
for me? -I'm...

26:12.438 --> 26:14.040
Uh...

26:14.073 --> 26:17.877
Uh, no, uh, Your Honor.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.312
No more questions.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.251
JUDGE BARNES:
Mr. Lyon, you may step down.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.755
Court is recessed for two hours.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.424
COOKIE:
Lucious, that was brilliant.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.626
What do you think, Hakeem?

26:33.660 --> 26:35.127
How we doing?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.630
Well, your father gave
very moving testimony,

26:37.664 --> 26:39.565
but it's hard to know
how the judge is leaning.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.801
Hakeem, you're young.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.069
Know you ain't about to tell me

26:43.102 --> 26:44.136
I can just
make some more babies.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.571
Oh...

26:45.604 --> 26:47.106
You know what? You fired, man.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.141
Whoa. Just-- let's just
not be hasty, okay?

26:49.175 --> 26:50.743
-He doesn't really mean that.
-Yes, I do mean it.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.012
-I'm-a represent myself, homie.
-Come on, man.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.413
Hakeem, let's not be stupid.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.916
I'm not stupid, Ma,
I'm a grown-ass man.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.318
And I love my daughter
more than anything in the world.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.954
So "it's hard to know"
ain't a good answer.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.423
This is about
more than love, Hakeem.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.959
LUCIOUS: I had a strategy,
Hakeem. What's yours?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.095
I got a legal strategy.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.464
Is there any law that says
I can't fight for my baby?

27:12.498 --> 27:15.601
Um, just the basic law
of human stupidity.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.003
Don't do this.

27:17.036 --> 27:20.139
It's my baby, it's my fight.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.545
It's a very risky choice,
young man.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.815
I don't advise it,

27:28.848 --> 27:31.818
but it is indeed
your legal right.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.452
Proceed.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.288
I call Anika Calhoun
to the stand, Your Honor.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.325
(gallery murmuring)

27:39.358 --> 27:42.294
It's like watching this boy
put a gun to his damn head.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.264
LUCIOUS:
Just sit tight.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.037
You don't remember Hakeem.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.039
That boy ain't never
had no damn strategy.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.475
Okay, Ms. Calhoun.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.710
(clears throat):
Mm-hmm?

27:57.744 --> 27:59.645
What's Bella's favorite color?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.881
(laughs)

28:01.914 --> 28:03.850
Her favorite color?

28:03.883 --> 28:05.852
She doesn't have one.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.053
Yeah, she does.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.391
What fruit makes her tummy hurt?

28:17.263 --> 28:21.667
Uh, she was on formula
when I had to leave.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.004
Okay, let's talk about
since you been around.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.073
What's Bella's
favorite stuffed toy?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.850
I-I don't know.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.719
When she's scared at night,
what song calms her down?

28:40.753 --> 28:43.589
Look, she's my baby,

28:43.622 --> 28:46.926
but I'm still trying to get
to know her, and it takes time.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.595
Okay, then, what's your baby's
every night, on the dot bedtime?

28:51.597 --> 28:53.732
What's her favorite
picture book?

28:56.903 --> 28:58.905
Three Little Pigs.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.908
No.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.109
That one scares her.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.144
(gallery murmuring)

29:07.947 --> 29:09.481
I don't know.

29:12.952 --> 29:16.022
What does she call her grandpa?

29:22.795 --> 29:24.763
(sighs)

29:24.797 --> 29:27.299
Hakeem, I just got back.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.469
Okay? So I don't know her
as well as you do.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.905
-Not yet. -Yeah, but I wanted
you to get to know her.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.673
-I tried. -I wanted you
to share time with her.

29:34.706 --> 29:38.110
I wanted you to get to know
everything about her.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.848
My door's been open.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.150
I would've never tried
to cut you out of her life.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.485
But then, here you are,
trying to take my daughter away.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.988
And you don't even know her.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.165
Dooshus.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.801
She calls him Dooshus.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.837
Dooshus.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.741
No more questions, Your Honor.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.780
You may step down, Ms. Calhoun.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.183
That was good.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.220
(whispers):
Good job.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.289
JUDGE BARNES:
This court is now in recess.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.191
(gavel bangs)

30:25.224 --> 30:28.394
Ooh, she is salty.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.063
You did good.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.798
JAMAL: Man, Johnnie Cochran
over here, man.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.034
-You killed it.
-I'm so proud of you, son.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.903
What now, Thirsty?

30:36.936 --> 30:39.738
-What now? Little big man
gets his baby back. -Yes!

30:39.771 --> 30:41.707
Better stock up on them diapers,
too, 'cause she gonna need it.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.075
(chuckles)

30:43.109 --> 30:44.743
(footsteps approaching)

30:46.045 --> 30:48.447
JAMAL:
I thought she was in Gstaad.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.383
COOKIE:
The hell is she doing here?

30:51.417 --> 30:52.618
I got no idea.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.322
BAILIFF:
Court is about to be in session.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.390
Plaintiff calls
a rebuttal witness.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.458
-What?
-Come on.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.563
She can't hurt you.
She doesn't know you.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.232
Does she?

31:06.265 --> 31:08.434
Good. We good, then.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.407
-I thought your mother
was in Gstaad. -She was.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.576
She just returned last night.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.078
Uh-huh.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.953
(gallery murmuring)

31:35.227 --> 31:37.196
Is there anything
we need to know?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.730
No.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.366
You sure?
Ain't nothing you ain't tell us?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.101
I don't even know her like that.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.105
Mother.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.940
-(clears throat)
-Excuse me.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.308
Mrs. Dubois.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.609
Do you know Hakeem Lyon?

31:50.642 --> 31:53.145
Oh, I certainly do.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.548
Hakeem, Bella and I have spent
every Tuesday afternoon together

31:56.582 --> 31:58.917
for the past five months.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.420
-(gallery murmuring)
-JUDGE BARNES: Quiet.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.492
He's a very, well,
pleasant young man,

32:06.525 --> 32:10.062
and I might add,
an attentive father.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.064
Pity to have been born
into a family

32:12.098 --> 32:14.700
of such unscrupulous people.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.770
-Object. Make an objection.
-ANGELO: Wow. Well,

32:18.804 --> 32:20.772
what would make you think that?

32:20.806 --> 32:23.142
Oh, it's not what I think.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.676
It's what Hakeem told me.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.978
Objection!

32:26.012 --> 32:28.080
Sustained. That's hearsay.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.482
Your Honor,
Mrs. Dubois has recorded

32:30.516 --> 32:32.284
these visits with Hakeem.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.753
Objection, she can't
show no videotapes.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.188
She don't have my permission.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.590
I didn't sign off on
no releases; don't she

32:38.624 --> 32:40.759
-need my permission, Your Honor?
-Not in New York state.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.330
In this state, only one of the
recorded parties needs consent.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.699
And Mrs. Dubois
gave that consent.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.835
JUDGE BARNES:
That is, in fact, the law.

32:52.238 --> 32:57.143
I assume you have the means
to screen these tapes?

32:57.176 --> 32:58.610
Yes, I do.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.479
JUDGE BARNES:
Thank you.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.815
What's on the tapes, Hakeem?

33:03.849 --> 33:06.185
At least tell me
what's on the damn tapes.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.186
Nothing.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.655
She's a very beautiful baby.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.790
Hmm.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.126
DIANA (on tape):
(laughs) So precious. So...

33:14.160 --> 33:16.962
-This was three months ago.
-Okay.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.697
DIANA (on tape):
How's your father, Hakeem?

33:18.730 --> 33:20.232
(sighs) He'll live.

33:20.266 --> 33:23.069
A lot of people try to
do bad things to my dad

33:23.102 --> 33:24.736
'cause he's done bad things
to people.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.138
He's a monster.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.907
So many people hate us.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.477
I'm surprised that bomb
didn't take us all out.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.079
DIANA (on tape):
Ooh, for heaven's sakes.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.981
HAKEEM: I can't trust Bella
with either one of my brothers.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.385
Jamal with his pills, and Andre,
he just straight-up crazy.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.587
-(scoffs, chuckles)
-It's not his fault.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.655
He just loses it sometimes.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.991
He almost had a kid of his own,
but it died.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.393
-Objection, stop!
-Probably for the better.

33:47.426 --> 33:52.364
Counselor, how much longer
must we all bear this?

33:52.398 --> 33:54.766
There's just a third tape,
Your Honor.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.537
But it-- he just says he wishes
his mother was still in jail.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.606
-Objection!
-(gallery murmuring)

34:00.639 --> 34:01.773
Overruled.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.009
You believe this?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.677
I rest my case.
Thank you, Mother.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.748
JUDGE BARNES:
Mrs. Dubois, you may step down.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.659
You just lost
your daughter, son.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.096
She was after me.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.897
She had Bella this whole time.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.433
-I had to do what she said or...
-Look, boy,

34:27.466 --> 34:28.900
you could have told us.

34:28.934 --> 34:32.104
She played you. She played you
against your own family.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.905
Look, I'm sorry.

34:33.939 --> 34:34.973
Andre?

34:37.075 --> 34:38.877
Jamal?

34:38.910 --> 34:40.078
LUCIOUS: You better
start talking, Hakeem.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.448
Look, I said those things...

34:42.481 --> 34:45.817
Boy, you talked
against this family to people

34:45.851 --> 34:48.587
who are against us.
How could you do that, Hakeem?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.926
Y'all stay out of my sight.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.465
The judge has made her decision.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.667
Get your ass up.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.839
All rise.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.977
(sighs)

35:16.148 --> 35:17.383
Please be seated.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.321
I've reached my verdict.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.657
Young man, you are courageous,

35:25.691 --> 35:29.495
and I've seen how much
you love your daughter.

35:29.528 --> 35:33.199
But, by your own words,
your family poses a threat

35:33.232 --> 35:36.502
to her well-being
that I cannot abide.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.437
Miss Calhoun, while not perfect,

35:38.470 --> 35:43.709
offers a safe and stable home
and an exemplary community.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.644
For those reasons,

35:45.677 --> 35:51.116
this court awards full custody
of Bella Lyon to her mother,

35:51.149 --> 35:54.953
-Anika Calhoun.
-Yes! (laughs) -(gavel bangs)

35:54.986 --> 35:56.622
-Yes! -Yes!
-Court is adjourned.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.757
We did it. Oh...

36:02.027 --> 36:03.929
ANIKA:
Oh, I'm so happy.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.470
-Thank you. (laughs)
-Thank you. Good job.

36:11.503 --> 36:16.342
You did great.
I'll give you a minute.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.876
Oh, that's wonderful.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.412
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.516
Yes!

36:32.724 --> 36:34.926
(toilet flushes)

36:46.805 --> 36:50.342
You filthy, treacherous bitch.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.077
I'll take that as a compliment.

36:52.110 --> 36:56.682
You fixed it so my son
could lose his child.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.617
What kind of animal are you?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.886
Oh, poor Cookie.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.889
You can dish it out,
but you can't take it, can you?

37:05.424 --> 37:07.626
I just want you
and your disgusting family

37:07.659 --> 37:09.194
out of my life for good.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.596
Oh, I should think
you're well on your way

37:10.629 --> 37:12.398
to getting that wish.

37:12.431 --> 37:13.899
Excuse me.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.611
They don't have enough soap
in here for your dirty ass.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.249
BECKY: So, let's make sure
that gets done on time.

37:31.283 --> 37:34.119
Uh, message Julie
and find out when I can

37:34.152 --> 37:36.154
expect the "Coagulation" demo.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.089
-Oh, and V has a photo shoot...
-Yo, Becky.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.758
...that was pushed to 2:00 p.m.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.161
Hey. So, V's photo shoot
has been moved to 2:00 p.m.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.930
Bruce has a conflict.
I'll meet you guys up there.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.065
Hey, I didn't get
a chance to listen

37:47.098 --> 37:48.800
to the final mix of your song.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.302
I've been slammed all day
'cause Cookie's been in court.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.737
I'm not here for that.

37:51.770 --> 37:55.907
I'm here to let you know I'm
happy that we had a chance to,

37:55.941 --> 37:57.909
you know, hash out our issues.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.245
(chuckles)
Is that what we're calling it?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.448
-And I was wondering if...
-Actually,

38:02.481 --> 38:05.116
since you brought up
hashing out our issues,

38:05.150 --> 38:07.419
I'm really glad we did, too.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.320
You are?

38:08.354 --> 38:09.521
Yeah.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.956
'Cause now there's closure.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.326
Closure?

38:14.360 --> 38:18.096
I worked really hard
to get where I am,

38:18.129 --> 38:20.632
and I want to
give this job my all.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.300
You understand that, right?

38:24.336 --> 38:26.538
Yeah. Sure.

38:26.572 --> 38:30.008
Great. So from here on out,

38:30.041 --> 38:32.177
we'll just
keep things professional.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.879
I'm gonna listen to the mix,

38:33.912 --> 38:35.981
and I'm gonna get back to you
with my notes.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.790
(all laughing)

38:44.823 --> 38:47.459
Well, I want to congratulate
my son Angelo

38:47.493 --> 38:51.397
on a spectacular takedown
of the littlest Lyon cub.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.531
Why, thank you, Mother.

38:52.564 --> 38:56.034
And Anika for finally
associating with people

38:56.067 --> 38:58.404
who are worthy
of your stature, darling.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.171
-Thank you, Diana.
-Hear, hear.

39:00.205 --> 39:05.411
It feels good to finally be in a
place where I feel like I, um...

39:05.444 --> 39:07.045
-like I belong.
-DIANA: Good.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.881
So, a night of celebration,
Montrachet.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.350
But there is more work
to be done.

39:12.384 --> 39:16.422
Warren, my dear, you're up next.
I trust you're up to the task?

39:16.455 --> 39:18.056
-Well...
-He ain't ready.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.225
I don't think his head's
in the game. Are you ready?

39:22.293 --> 39:24.963
Yeah. I'm ready.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.834
DIANA:
Good.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.538
Lana, introduce us
to your friend.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.239
This is Simon Lambert.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.575
He's a highly regarded
medicating physician

39:36.608 --> 39:39.945
with a very exclusive
patient list.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.582
In fact, I saw one of
my favorite patients

39:43.615 --> 39:45.584
just the other day.

39:45.617 --> 39:48.454
I'm afraid I had to up his meds.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.724
Ooh, let us drink to that.
Raise your glasses high.

39:52.758 --> 39:53.625
Cheers.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.928
-Hear, hear.
-(Diana laughing)

40:04.836 --> 40:09.775
* The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the waterspout *

40:09.808 --> 40:11.977
* Down came the rain...

40:12.010 --> 40:14.446
(knock on door)

40:28.093 --> 40:29.561
No strangers.

40:29.595 --> 40:33.465
I got it. I got it.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.335
(Bella coos)

40:37.368 --> 40:40.972
I fed her already,
and she good till the morning.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.008
Okay.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.976
Her favorite stuffy
is in her bag.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.846
It's the pig. Also,
when she gets scared at night,

40:47.879 --> 40:52.117
-I need you to get her dinosaur
to protect her. -(Bella cries)

40:52.150 --> 40:55.253
Also, she eats
with a tennis ball in her hand.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.488
I don't know why.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.695
-Hakeem, I...
-She starts fading at 8:30,

41:03.729 --> 41:05.864
and she's out by 9:00.

41:05.897 --> 41:09.234
Once she asleep,
she'll sleep through anything.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.805
Her favorite song
is "This Old Man."

41:13.839 --> 41:15.841
She kind of likes "Drip Drop."

41:30.088 --> 41:31.322
Anika?

41:33.925 --> 41:38.329
Yellow.
Her favorite color's yellow.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.699
I'll remember that.

41:42.701 --> 41:43.769
(Bella cries)

41:52.177 --> 41:56.347
(Bella crying loudly)

42:26.812 --> 42:30.248
We lost her.
We had her and then we lost her.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.549
We'll get her back.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.951
How?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.886
'Cause I can't sit through
another trial.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.556
Me, either.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.225
I swear to God
that's the last time

42:40.258 --> 42:42.293
I'll sit in a godforsaken trial.

42:42.327 --> 42:45.296
A courtroom with people
deciding the fate

42:45.330 --> 42:47.498
of what's gonna happen
to my babies.

42:57.809 --> 43:00.946
I really hope you're back,
Lucious, 'cause I need you.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.581
I want blood.

43:03.615 --> 43:06.317
I want blood to spill.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.754
I want blood to pour
like a river.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.155
And I'm-a make that happen,

43:10.188 --> 43:12.157
I promise you.

43:12.190 --> 43:14.459
And this won't get in my way.

43:24.836 --> 43:28.674
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:58.704 --> 44:00.772
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:00.806 --> 44:03.308
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:06.511 --> 44:09.147
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:09.180 --> 44:12.017
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:12.050 --> 44:14.052
WOMAN:
This is our story.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.456
* Can't stop me now *
