00:01.502 --> 00:02.582
Announcer: Previously on "Haven"...

00:02.670 --> 00:05.161
- There's no way Mara got off
Duke's boat without his help.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.587
- Dwight's about to sell us out.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.335
He's gonna tell
his lady friend at the CDC

00:08.426 --> 00:10.087
all about the Troubles.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.839
I got a job for you to do.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.420
- You're going through
rapid waves of deterioration.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.096
Every cell in your body.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.846
- You trusted her with
our most ancient secrets?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.051
- Charlotte Cross
is here to help

00:20.146 --> 00:21.602
save this town
from the Troubles.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.429
- We need real proof
that Charlotte Cross

00:23.524 --> 00:24.980
isn't who she says she is.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.648
- That sample of Aether
you gave me--

00:26.736 --> 00:27.851
could you get me
some more?

00:27.945 --> 00:28.980
- The Aether--
where is it?

00:29.071 --> 00:31.198
- It's missing.
- I won't abandon you, Duke.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.614
You say you don't
need anyone.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.033
This Trouble is proof
that you're lying.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.530
- You wouldn't
be saying all this

00:37.622 --> 00:39.283
if you didn't have
some kind of angle.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.113
-ldo.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.995
To save you.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.222
- Hey.

01:02.313 --> 01:05.646
- I thought you had gone all
"wham-bam, thank you, ma'am."

01:05.733 --> 01:07.815
- Not exactly my style.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.233
- Oh.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.651
- I'm headed out
after the Aether.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.982
I think I might
have an idea

01:16.077 --> 01:18.068
of where Dwight
and Nathan moved it to.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.322
- Right now?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.153
- Yeah, right now.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.160
What did you think
we were gonna do?

01:23.251 --> 01:26.835
Have brunch?
Crosswords in bed?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.832
- Something like that.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.503
- Well...

01:33.594 --> 01:34.834
I'm sorry to disappoint.

01:34.929 --> 01:38.092
- Hey, I get it,
and you're right.

01:38.182 --> 01:42.972
You're okay now,
but finding Aether is key.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.553
- Why?

01:45.648 --> 01:47.513
- To fix you.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.223
I'm on board, Duke.

01:49.318 --> 01:53.277
Find the Aether,
and we could do that

01:53.364 --> 01:56.197
a thousand times over.

01:56.284 --> 02:00.402
You have an angry energy,
and I like that in bed.

02:01.789 --> 02:05.077
- Yeah, okay.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.953
- Hey.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.579
Do you believe me
that I want to help you?

02:11.674 --> 02:13.665
- Yeah.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.376
I mean,
I have to, right?

02:16.470 --> 02:20.304
- You don't have to.
You do.

02:24.729 --> 02:28.221
- I think there's still some eggs
in the fridge if you're hungry.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.352
- There is.
I bought them.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.399
Oh, but we need toast

02:32.486 --> 02:34.568
and butter.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.896
Real butter.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.405
- Already so demanding.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.294
- Did Gloria get the DNA
from Charlotte Cross?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.460
- The military has
a vast database.

02:51.547 --> 02:55.586
It's gonna take a few more hours
to see if our alleged CDC doctor

02:55.676 --> 02:57.758
has her DNA on file
with the government.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.928
- Well, she was a Navy surgeon,
so it should be there.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.597
- You sound very sure
of Dr. Cross all of a sudden.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.266
What's different?
- I'm not sure.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.562
But she seems very serious
about her research into the Troubles.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.193
Audrey is sick.
Charlotte is helping her.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.861
- Sick? With what?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.325
- We don't know.
It just started.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.024
Could be the split
from Mara.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.535
Who knows what
she's really doing with it?

03:28.626 --> 03:30.867
What if she's running
some kind of experiment?

03:30.961 --> 03:32.667
- Well, if she is, it's over,

03:32.755 --> 03:36.623
because the last of the Aether
was just stolen right from there.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.548
- Stolen? By who?

03:38.636 --> 03:40.467
- Why don't you tell me?

03:40.554 --> 03:44.297
Someone with a Guard tattoo,
probably working with Mara.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.132
So I need to find her.

03:46.227 --> 03:49.139
- Well, you may have
lost your focus,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.391
But I'm gonna prove
that Charlotte Cross

03:51.482 --> 03:53.268
isn't what she seems.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.652
- How do you feel?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.483
- Comes and goes.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.035
- I'm sorry, Audrey.

04:07.123 --> 04:08.829
The cell degeneration--

04:08.916 --> 04:10.872
it's getting worse.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.086
- Okay, so--

04:16.173 --> 04:17.709
so what do I need to do?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.415
- Well, for starters, rest.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.047
Let your cute boyfriend
take care of you.

04:22.138 --> 04:25.050
- I haven't told him yet.

04:25.141 --> 04:27.848
He's not good with problems
that he can't fix.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.051
- Well, speaking about
not telling anyone,

04:30.146 --> 04:33.855
I've been wondering
if you've been forthright with me.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.442
- About what?

04:35.526 --> 04:37.357
- Your condition.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.027
By your own admission,
it might be a Trouble,

04:40.114 --> 04:42.526
but we're not pursuing it
as a Trouble.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.607
- No, I don't think that it is.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.909
I seem to be
the only one affected.

04:46.996 --> 04:50.864
- Are you somehow special
in a way I don't know about?

04:50.958 --> 04:53.244
- (laughs)
No.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.577
No, I'm just normal.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.880
- That, I can assure you,
Audrey, you're not.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.337
Your hands are so cold.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.265
With your body temperature,
you should be hypothermic.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.091
I'm gonna get you
some more B-12,

05:11.187 --> 05:15.396
boosters, maybe even
some steroids.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.895
I'll be back.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.587
- Vince?
- Shh, keep it down.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.925
- What--
what are you doing?

05:42.009 --> 05:45.797
- Visiting my sick friend Audrey
at the doctor's office.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.755
That's my story
if I get caught.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.714
- Caught?
What are you talking about?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.135
- I don't trust
Charlotte Cross.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.601
- You know she just left
to go get me B-12 shots?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.854
- I don't think she's
who she says she is,

06:00.945 --> 06:03.903
and I'm gonna find some evidence
that'll corroborate that.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.239
Evidence like this.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.032
- Oh, my--
photos of Lucy and Sarah.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.829
- What-- how did
she have this?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.953
(camera snapping)
- I don't know.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.330
But don't say anything yet.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.545
And come and see me.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.969
(somber folk music)

07:05.801 --> 07:09.089
- Me as Sarah, Lucy...

07:10.806 --> 07:13.172
And Veronica.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.599
- I knew Charlotte Cross
was up to something.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.849
- If she's not with the CDC,
then what is she doing here?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.272
- Studying you, it would seem.

07:23.527 --> 07:27.019
- Well, seeing
all these images,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.856
the one that's clear to me
is that you never age.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.191
People would kill
for a fountain of youth.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.742
- I don't feel so youthful.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.694
And what people?
- I don't know.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.121
But for your sake,
we have to find out.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.415
- Yeah.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.709
- Get anywhere
with our missing Aether?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.412
I did some digging.
It's Kirk Bowers.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.589
- Eh, that's not my favorite
Guard member.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.791
- Or mine.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.468
He went after Charlotte
the other day.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.887
Ever since his Trouble kicked in
and he suffocated those people

07:53.974 --> 07:56.215
at the hospital,
he's been desperate for a cure.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.800
- So he stole the Aether
'cause he thinks

07:57.895 --> 07:58.930
it can turn off his Trouble?

07:59.021 --> 08:01.262
- Who knows?
He's unstable, Nathan.

08:01.357 --> 08:02.972
- Can't have an unstable
Troubled guy

08:03.067 --> 08:04.227
running around with Aether.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.683
- No, we can't.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.018
- I'm on it.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.855
- Okay, you're good to go.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.741
Perfect--
my coffee break.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.117
- This is purely
a business call.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.996
- Coffee is the official
beverage of business.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.169
We could drink standing up.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.631
Make it feel more like work.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.125
- I can't.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.082
- That's disappointing.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.508
- Tell me about it.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.051
When we solve this,
trust me,

08:33.138 --> 08:34.753
you won't be able
to keep me away with a stick.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.682
- I think I could
if I wanted to.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.473
- Any luck with the cure?

08:41.563 --> 08:44.305
- I don't suppose you found
the Aether that was stolen.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.767
- Nathan's following a lead.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.773
- Without that Aether...
I mean, other diseases--

08:50.864 --> 08:54.857
smallpox, the plague,
even ebola--

08:54.952 --> 08:56.943
there's people
who survived the disease

08:57.037 --> 08:58.618
who have antibodies
in their blood,

08:58.706 --> 09:01.789
but if I don't have
someone who--

09:01.875 --> 09:04.617
- Duke.
- What?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.668
- Duke Crocker.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.622
He can cure a person's Trouble,
remove it from a whole family.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.174
- What? Why didn't you
tell me about him before?

09:12.261 --> 09:13.967
- Duke's complicated.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.295
- You can trust me, Dwight.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.052
I'm just trying to help.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.145
- She has information on Lucy,
Sarah, even Veronica.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.065
I'm scared, Nathan, she has
my blood work, test results,

09:28.152 --> 09:30.268
hidden in a personal file.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.813
- So she's not helping you
get better.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.615
She's studying you...
Like a specimen.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.411
- I don't think
I can get better.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.205
- What?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.954
Wh--

09:46.044 --> 09:50.959
- Dr. Cross said that
my cells were degenerating.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.804
- Uh...

09:59.892 --> 10:01.883
How do I know
she's telling the truth?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.143
- Because I feel it happening.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.434
Every so often,
itjust hits.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.951
- I'm glad you called me.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.657
- We're gonna
figure this out, right?

10:26.752 --> 10:30.665
- Mm-hmm.
If Duke could just--

10:30.756 --> 10:32.212
(exhales)

10:32.299 --> 10:36.133
Duke.
It's always Duke.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.676
I told him.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.379
I told him
that you were sick.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.714
that we needed Mara.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.219
- Yeah, but we don't
even know if Mara has

10:43.310 --> 10:45.050
anything to do with
what's happening to me.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.512
- We don't know she doesn't,
so I'm gonna get that Aether.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.813
I'm gonna find out for sure.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.266
Mara wants it so bad,
she convinced Duke to steal it.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.101
But Kirk got to it first.
I know where he is.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.732
He's got a room
behind the strip club.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.532
- So you're gonna use
the Aether to flush Mara out?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.529
But Duke might be there.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.655
- Well, then he'd better
stay the hell out of the way.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.668
(phone ringing)

11:11.755 --> 11:13.916
Mara: Duke?
- Let me guess.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.588
We're out of milk.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.416
- Someone's here.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.591
- Where?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.089
- They're coming
in the front door.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.717
- Can you see who it is?
- I don 't know.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.014
I'm under the bed.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.592
- Okay, listen.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.269
There's a gun
hidden under the sink.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.267
- No, let go of me,
you son of a bitch!

11:31.358 --> 11:32.768
- Mara.
- (screams)

11:32.860 --> 11:34.316
- Mara.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.186
(engine starts)

11:38.282 --> 11:40.523
(tires screech)

11:57.467 --> 11:59.207
Damn it.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.895
Yeah, you fought back,
all right.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.746
Got you.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.170
(bluesy rock music)

12:48.936 --> 12:51.723
- Well, look who finally got tired
of umbrella drinks at the Gull.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.974
- You got a license
for that big mouth?

13:01.823 --> 13:03.029
- It's been a while.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.731
What you drinking
these days?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.283
- I'm on duty, McHugh.
Just water.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.078
- Chief of police--
that's right.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.372
And Guard leader

13:12.459 --> 13:15.872
and working on a way
to actually cure the Troubles.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.249
- Pretty well-informed for someone
who walked away from all this.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.126
- It's the best thing
I ever did.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.299
And just my opinion-- I think you
should've done the same thing.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.469
- Yeah, I tried, but this town needs
people like us, McHugh.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.216
- No, like you.
Grady always could recruit 'em.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.639
He had a knack for it.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.886
You didn't come here
to reminisce about

13:30.978 --> 13:33.310
the good old Guard days,
though, did you?

13:33.397 --> 13:34.887
- I need some advice.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.938
- Let me guess--
woman trouble,

13:37.025 --> 13:39.141
and you want to tell
the bartender all about it.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.227
- (chuckles)

13:41.321 --> 13:42.936
- Seriously?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.896
Well, it's about time you had
some woman problems.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.574
What's she like?
- Well, she's smart.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.743
She's caring.
She's real.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.156
- So what's the problem?

13:54.251 --> 13:57.914
- Charlotte-- she could do
a lot of great things for Haven.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.246
I just don't want
to get in the way.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.841
- Bet if you did,
she would tell you.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.166
- Maybe.

14:04.261 --> 14:07.253
I think I'm falling for her.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.338
(computer trilling)

14:12.269 --> 14:14.180
- Gloria, I appreciate
the help and all,

14:14.271 --> 14:16.353
but is there any way you can
make this thing go faster?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.393
- Look, I'm not gonna tell anybody
that you came here,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.816
but I'm worried about you.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.154
I mean, is Mara
really worth

14:23.238 --> 14:25.604
tanking all your other
friendships?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.361
- Maybe I'm not the one
who did the tanking.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.031
- I know, there are two sides
to every story, kitten.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.158
But this isn't a sandbox fight.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.410
People's lives are
mixed up in this.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.162
- I'm just doing
what I have to.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.833
No one wants to see it.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.124
- You always were
a good kid.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.301
A criminal
but a good kid.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.889
(computer beeps)

14:51.308 --> 14:52.593
There's your guy.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.886
- Kirk Bowers.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.727
- Duke, be careful.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.736
- So when you told her about
the Troubles, how did she take it?

15:05.822 --> 15:07.687
- She freaked out
but in the right way.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.899
I mean, she doesn't
think I'm an alien.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.575
She didn't try to shoot me,
at least on purpose.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.404
- Good, last thing you need
is another bucket of grief.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.705
You ever talk to the ex?

15:21.797 --> 15:23.583
- Not a word.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.668
But it's not all on her.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.500
I mean, she didn't know
what she was signing up for.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.961
- Neither did you.
Neither did any of us.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.842
Look, when you find out
that you're Troubled--

15:32.933 --> 15:34.844
that someone
you love is Troubled,

15:34.935 --> 15:36.345
that's tough to swallow.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.018
But if you care enough,
you can get past it.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.642
- Well, that's just the thing,
with Charlotte and I,

15:40.732 --> 15:42.393
right from
the very beginning,

15:42.484 --> 15:43.724
everything's been
out in the open.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.231
No hiding, no secrets.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.656
I think that's what I need.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.444
- Sorry.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.025
- You cutting me off?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.451
- You're done here.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.072
Go talk to your lady.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.668
(motorcycle engine revs)

16:12.597 --> 16:14.133
- Where'd you hide it, Kirk?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.319
The docks.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.820
(lock clicks)

16:47.340 --> 16:48.420
Duke?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.964
- What the hell are
you doing here?

16:50.051 --> 16:52.337
- I could ask you the same thing.
Put the gun down.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.049
Put the gun down!

17:04.399 --> 17:05.605
- How is Audrey?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.193
- Sick.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.310
I needed you.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.772
Thankfully, Dr. Cross
seems to be helping her.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.482
- She's seeing the CDC doc?

17:15.577 --> 17:18.410
- We had no choice.
Where the hell you been, Duke?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.159
- Someone took Mara.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.958
- Mara?

17:25.045 --> 17:27.161
And you're worried about her?

17:27.255 --> 17:29.041
The creator of the Troubles?

17:29.132 --> 17:31.839
- You know, I don't have
to explain myself to you, Nathan.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.134
- I'm a cop,
and you just picked a lock.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.837
So yeah, you do.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.797
- So that's where we are now?
- Yeah.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.304
If you're willing to sacrifice Audrey
and this entire town

17:41.394 --> 17:43.726
for that evil bitch,
then that's where we are.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.271
- That evil bitch...

17:47.359 --> 17:49.395
is gonna help me
save this town.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.985
- What are you
doing here?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.533
- Kirk...

17:58.620 --> 18:01.077
Kirk took Mara.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.665
- Or he's working with her.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.580
- No.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.158
What would she need
with him?

18:08.964 --> 18:11.706
- Kirk has the Aether.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.542
- What are you talking about?
- I got to find him.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.753
- I have to find him.
- No.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.063
- Is that Mara's hair and blood?
- Could be.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.405
- What does Kirk get
by torturing her?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.945
- Kirk's Troubled.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.363
Maybe it's payback.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.532
- You don't care
if we get her back in one piece?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.359
- If I didn't think
she could help Audrey,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.911
I wouldn't care
how many pieces we find her in.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.633
What, you gonna hit me?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.753
Really?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.884
She means that much to you?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.840
- (exhales)

19:06.396 --> 19:07.977
I'm sorry.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.055
You're right, I don't know
what I was thinking.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.354
(sighs)

19:45.685 --> 19:48.097
(P.A. announcement
in background)

19:48.188 --> 19:50.645
(indistinct chatter)

19:51.691 --> 19:54.273
- Audrey, you should be
home resting.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.977
- Well, couldn't sleep.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.109
I found these.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.986
Can you explain?

20:03.119 --> 20:04.529
- You want me to explain

20:04.621 --> 20:07.704
why you've been hiding
information from your doctor?

20:07.791 --> 20:09.281
How about we start
with why you two

20:09.376 --> 20:10.661
have been going
through my stuff?

20:10.752 --> 20:13.209
- This is the real reason
you came to Haven, isn't it?

20:13.296 --> 20:15.287
You're after the secret
to Audrey Parker.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.124
- Because she's dying of something
I've never seen before,

20:18.218 --> 20:21.676
and it's my job
to save her life.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.379
Look, I spotted
a photograph--

20:27.811 --> 20:30.803
this one--
in the "Haven Herald"

20:30.897 --> 20:33.354
when Dwight was explaining
the Troubles to me.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.817
I figured
Audrey might have

20:34.901 --> 20:37.643
some sort of
reincarnation Trouble.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.477
So I went online

20:39.572 --> 20:42.735
and saw
the "Herald" archives,

20:42.826 --> 20:44.908
and I found all of those.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.985
- Did Jennifer digitize
the archive?

20:49.249 --> 20:50.409
Were all of these in there?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.240
- I'm not sure.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.668
- Again?
- She's been--

20:55.755 --> 20:57.666
- No, I am tired of this,
Vince.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.419
- Dwight, come on.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.797
Let's go.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.762
- Unbelievable.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.852
- It's okay, Dwight.
- It's not okay.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.930
We're working to save them--
all of them.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.184
- They're scared.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.436
- They shouldn't be
accusing you.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.563
They should be thanking you.
- I understand.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.066
There's a lot at stake,
and I'm an outsider.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.075
I could do better work
if they could just trust me.

21:27.162 --> 21:31.075
- You're in on a secret that
we've kept for hundreds of years.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.703
I brought you in.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.294
We'll convince them together.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.629
- I like the sound of that.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.083
If we're gonna be
working together,

21:43.178 --> 21:46.966
let's define
professional space.

21:47.056 --> 21:52.471
So I'm thinking
that this is personal,

21:52.562 --> 21:55.679
and I'm thinking
professional is, what,

21:55.773 --> 21:59.015
like, four feet?

22:24.177 --> 22:25.633
Okay.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.179
You think this is a mistake.
I should go.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.534
(line ringing)

22:53.915 --> 22:54.995
(beep)

22:55.083 --> 22:57.165
- You've reached Nathan.
Leave a message.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.334
(beep)

22:59.420 --> 23:02.378
- (coughs)

23:15.728 --> 23:18.105
(car door opens)

23:21.734 --> 23:22.985
- Did you get something?

23:23.069 --> 23:25.185
- Do baby bears poop
in the woods?

23:26.781 --> 23:29.272
The DNA of this
Charlotte Cross

23:29.367 --> 23:32.029
doesn't match with
what the Pentagon has on file.

23:33.538 --> 23:36.996
- You hacked the Pentagon?
- Yes. Well, not exactly.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.246
Gloria has an old flame
in the LT. Department.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.917
- So it's all a front?

23:43.423 --> 23:45.835
The CDC car,
the badge, the--

23:47.927 --> 23:49.167
who is she?

23:49.262 --> 23:51.753
- You need power
and money to pull this off.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.845
- The CIA?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.675
- Or Mossad,
Russian black ops,

23:56.769 --> 24:00.227
or the private versions like
Blackwater who answer to no one.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.556
Just think what they would do
with the Troubles.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.766
- Think what
they would do to me.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.852
- We have
to find out the truth,

24:06.946 --> 24:09.437
but Dwight is
her guard dog.

24:09.532 --> 24:13.150
And we don't have any
real evidence-- just conjecture.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.235
- Fine.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.446
We don't tell Dwight
who she isn't.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.406
We tell him who she is.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.877
- How do we do that?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.701
- By using the toughest
government agency

24:23.796 --> 24:25.127
there is to dupe.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.631
The DMV.

24:29.677 --> 24:32.214
- That was amazing.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.465
- Mm, thank you, ma'am.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.593
- Which is pretty much
what I expected.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.060
You don't get extra points.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.931
- Wow-- demanding.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.388
You've got the heart
of a figure skating judge.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.144
- You watch figure skating?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.151
That's actually pretty adorable.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.360
So...

24:53.451 --> 24:55.737
We're naked.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.205
We should probably
get dressed.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.621
- Ag reed.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.494
- You go first.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.086
That way,
I can watch.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.287
(both laugh)

25:18.309 --> 25:19.469
- I've been looking
for you, Kirk.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.175
- Go to hell, Crocker.
I'm busy.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.894
- Yeah, I bet you are.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.689
I found your tools.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.695
Start talking.
- About what?

25:29.779 --> 25:31.940
- Where's Mara?
Where's the Aether?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.862
- None of your goddamn
business, Duke.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.817
- You're gonna tell me.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.874
- (grunts)

25:48.965 --> 25:52.378
You've activated my Trouble.
- I don't care.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.799
If you suck all of the air
out of this place,

25:53.886 --> 25:55.547
it won't stop me.

25:55.638 --> 25:56.798
Where is she?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.505
- I don't know!

26:00.643 --> 26:02.554
- I need her, Kirk.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.936
- (chokes)

26:18.244 --> 26:19.654
Audrey: We don 't know
that Duke killed him.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.705
- Well, the welt on my head
tells me he was motivated.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.248
Kirk stole the Aether
and kidnapped Mara.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.372
I'm telling you,
Mara's got in Duke's head.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.954
- Well, maybe Mara
really can fix him.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.834
- And when she doesn't?

26:32.925 --> 26:35.041
- Look, this isn't
about Mara, okay?

26:35.136 --> 26:36.967
This is about Duke.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.045
He ’3 got to have a reason
for what he's doing.

26:39.140 --> 26:43.850
- Yeah, like he's gone
totally psychotic.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.927
- It's Duke, Nathan.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.513
- This is not
the Duke I know.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.974
- He is hurting,
all right?

26:51.068 --> 26:53.684
Whatever's going on
with his curse,

26:53.780 --> 26:56.021
whatever Mara's
doing to him,

26:56.115 --> 26:57.195
he needs you.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.025
So just ﬁnd him,
talk to him,

27:00.119 --> 27:02.451
and remind him that
he still has friends.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.698
(coughs)

27:03.790 --> 27:06.202
- You find out anything more
about Dr. Cross?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.079
- As a matter of fact, Vince is
working on that right now.

27:11.672 --> 27:14.880
- Oh, Dr. Cross,
this may sound odd,

27:14.967 --> 27:16.832
but I think I need
your assistance.

27:16.928 --> 27:20.512
There's a sharp pain in my arm,
and my fingers are going numb.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.761
- Really?

27:24.852 --> 27:27.184
- And shortness of breath.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.765
- And let me guess--
a tightness in your chest?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.360
- Oh, yes, yes.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.436
Yes, it must be
all this stress.

27:36.531 --> 27:40.069
I'm sorry, but can you
examine me?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.820
- No.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.401
- Why?

27:43.496 --> 27:46.329
- Because why would I allow you
to continue to investigate me

27:46.415 --> 27:47.791
from the inside
as a patient?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.331
- Well, I might have a--

27:49.418 --> 27:51.670
- A bad acting coach
and research skills?

27:51.754 --> 27:55.246
You're holding the wrong arm
for a heart attack and stroke.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.504
So just, please, go.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.019
- Hey, Bennie.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.771
- What do you want,
Crocker?

28:20.867 --> 28:24.109
- Listen, I need to know
where Kirk might have taken a--

28:24.203 --> 28:26.785
well, a friend of ours,
I know you know.

28:26.873 --> 28:30.115
- No idea.
- Hey, come on, Bennie.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.995
Kirk sneezes,
you hand him a Kleenex.

28:32.086 --> 28:35.453
And besides,
you owe me.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.539
- Look, I don't know
where Kirk is.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.885
(gun clicks)

28:39.969 --> 28:41.834
- I don't have time for this.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.169
- So get lost.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.386
- What the hell is going on
with your eyes, man?

28:47.476 --> 28:49.012
- What are you talking about,
my eyes?

28:49.103 --> 28:50.843
- They're all silver.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.724
Get the hell
out of here, man.

28:54.108 --> 28:57.817
- No, they weren't
even bleeding.

29:00.031 --> 29:01.612
Bennie.

29:03.034 --> 29:04.240
Bennie, listen to me.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.533
Are you Troubled?

29:05.620 --> 29:06.905
I need you
to be straight with me.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.577
- Hell no.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.076
Did you just do
something to me, Crocker?

29:11.167 --> 29:13.533
- No!
- You did something to me.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.584
- I didn't do anything.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.251
- (coughing)

29:19.342 --> 29:21.082
I can't breathe.
- They're suffocating.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.839
How the hell did you do that?
- I didn't touch them.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.921
- You touched me.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.425
You gave me Kirk's Trouble.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.260
- That's not possible.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.264
- Leave me alone, Crocker.
- Bennie, open the door.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.974
Bennie!

29:38.069 --> 29:40.276
- They're dying!

29:42.406 --> 29:43.657
- (murmurs)

29:47.828 --> 29:49.443
(car chirps)

29:56.170 --> 30:00.209
- I remember my time in the FBI,
I did some undercover work--

30:00.299 --> 30:03.632
one of the toughest things to fake
was vehicular paperwork.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.301
- We'll find that, and we'll know
who Charlotte Cross really is.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.595
- Right.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.851
Here it is.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.975
Okay, you ready?

30:17.066 --> 30:19.352
- Uh-huh.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.853
- Okay.

30:25.408 --> 30:29.151
Car's owned by the CDC
out of New York.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.451
- Uh-huh.

30:30.538 --> 30:33.701
- Motor pool
has it assigned

30:33.791 --> 30:36.624
to out-of-state agent
Dr. Charlotte Cross.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.121
- No.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.919
(sighs)

30:41.007 --> 30:42.838
There must something.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.504
(car beeps)

30:46.595 --> 30:47.880
(soft jazz music)

30:47.972 --> 30:50.839
Well, it seems she likes
easy listening.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.595
- Damning,
but not enough.

30:53.686 --> 30:54.766
(music stops)

30:54.854 --> 30:57.641
Oh, you know what?
She said she came from New York.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.188
- Oh.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.819
- Okay, so--
(clears throat)

31:05.906 --> 31:08.283
So she started
in New York,

31:08.367 --> 31:12.986
and then she drove
through Albany,

31:13.080 --> 31:16.038
stopped off at an outlet store
in Vermont.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.787
I mean, makes sense.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.995
- I don't understand.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.922
No, she's just outsmarting us
at every turn.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.876
She's just exceptionally good
at creating an identity.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.677
- I would like to agree,
but we have to prove it.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.721
(both sigh)

31:40.691 --> 31:42.192
Vince, oh, my God.

31:42.276 --> 31:44.267
Do you remember this?

31:45.321 --> 31:47.277
You remember this, right?

31:48.491 --> 31:49.697
- It was Sarah's.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.651
She was a... Friend.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.576
It belongs to you now.

31:55.623 --> 31:56.954
That's yours.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.577
She stole it from you?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.999
- No, mine is--
mine is right here.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.378
- That's the exact same ring.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.970
- Nathan's wearing his.

32:14.058 --> 32:17.391
We just figured that
Lucy gave it to his father.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.059
- What does that mean?

32:19.146 --> 32:22.354
- (coughing)

32:24.068 --> 32:26.525
Oh, my dear,
you're freezing.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.727
You need to see
a doctor.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.689
- The only doctor that has
any answers right now

32:30.783 --> 32:33.616
is Dr. Charlotte Cross.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.239
So I need you
to hide the vehicle.

32:36.330 --> 32:40.369
I'm gonna call Nathan,
have him meet me here.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.950
This whole charade's
got to end.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.212
(coughing)

32:58.561 --> 32:59.801
- Easy.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.483
- HoW's your head?

33:08.571 --> 33:10.983
- Ever heard of the Troubles?
I can't feel it.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.734
- (chuckles)

33:12.825 --> 33:15.487
- I searched Kirk's boat
after I found his body.

33:16.704 --> 33:18.410
- Kirk's blood touched me.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.954
I couldn't control it.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.033
Oh, and another weird thing
happened today.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.664
I gave someone a Trouble.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.007
Yeah...

33:29.091 --> 33:30.956
When I touched him...

33:32.928 --> 33:35.260
he started sucking up
all the oxygen.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.134
- You gave someone
Kirk's Trouble,

33:38.225 --> 33:40.307
which you just absorbed
by killing Kirk.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.181
- Whatever is happening to me,
it's getting worse.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.601
And if Mara's dead--

33:46.692 --> 33:48.899
- Mara's not dead.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.317
Whoever took her
wouldn't kill her.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.689
She's got something
they need.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.694
(footsteps approaching)

34:00.539 --> 34:02.530
- Duke Crocker?

34:02.625 --> 34:03.865
- Yeah.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.411
- Sign here.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.860
- It's the canister
the Aether was in.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.359
- What is that, a toe?

34:36.450 --> 34:38.031
- Yeah.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.985
Mara's toe.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.488
She was wearing
this nail polish.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.120
- Okay.

34:47.211 --> 34:50.874
Kirk's dead,
so who sent it?

34:50.965 --> 34:52.375
They leave
a ransom note?

34:56.595 --> 35:00.713
That's all they sent,
just a...Toe.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.174
- Yeah.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.430
I'm just gonna take
one of your toes.

35:05.521 --> 35:08.763
Yeah, if you and Audrey
really are connected,

35:08.857 --> 35:12.475
well, then she'll lose one of hers too,
and then we'll know, right?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.152
(phone ringing)

35:20.244 --> 35:22.451
(sighs)

35:25.541 --> 35:28.453
Look, if we're gonna find Mara,
I need to take this.

35:28.544 --> 35:29.875
- Duke, let me help you.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.078
- Fine, help me.
Talk to the guard.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.753
Try to figure out where Kirk
might have stashed Mara.

35:33.841 --> 35:35.126
- Hey, hey.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.754
- We both need her,
Nathan.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.387
We're gonna have
to work together.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.010
(phone continues ringing)

35:44.101 --> 35:45.511
- I'm gonna meet Audrey
at the hospital.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.887
I'll make some calls
on the way.

35:46.979 --> 35:50.767
You and Audrey--
we need Mara to fix you both.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.268
- Yeah.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.060
(phone rings)

36:00.075 --> 36:01.576
Hello.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.992
- Have you figured it out yet,
Duke?

36:04.079 --> 36:06.240
- I'm working on it.

36:06.332 --> 36:09.620
- I'm so sorry that I can't
see your face right now.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.747
- I'm assuming the timing
of your call isn't a coincidence.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.419
- Well, I had
the courier check in

36:14.506 --> 36:18.124
after he delivered
my little present.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.833
- What the hell kind of game
are you playing, Mara?

36:19.928 --> 36:22.260
- A very carefully
crafted one.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.714
I'm naked, by the way.

36:24.808 --> 36:29.177
You really should've taken
one last plunge before we parted.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.683
- You got Kirk to steal
the Aether for you.

36:31.774 --> 36:35.437
- Yep, and then
you killed him.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.563
Thank you for tying up
my loose ends.

36:37.654 --> 36:40.612
We really did make a good team
while it lasted.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.031
Oh, and the toe--

36:43.118 --> 36:45.530
that really was a good touch,
don ’t you think?

36:45.621 --> 36:48.533
What better way to gut-punch
Duke Crocker,

36:48.624 --> 36:51.240
the self-reliant outlaw,

36:51.335 --> 36:54.873
than with the realization
that his worst fears

36:54.963 --> 36:56.544
are coming true?

36:56.632 --> 36:58.122
- I'm not afraid of toes.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.549
- You're afraid
of abandonment.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.718
By women.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.090
By your friends.

37:04.181 --> 37:06.513
- So whose is it?

37:06.600 --> 37:09.057
Hmm?

37:09.144 --> 37:10.475
Whose toe am I holding?

37:10.562 --> 37:11.972
- Oh, please.

37:12.064 --> 37:15.977
Do you think I would outsource
something so personal?

37:16.068 --> 37:18.229
It's my toe, Duke.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.856
Penance, Iguess.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.278
- You're sick,
you know that?

37:21.365 --> 37:22.821
- I'm sorry.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.614
I did what I had to do,

37:24.701 --> 37:27.989
but the truth is...

37:28.080 --> 37:31.322
I'm sad that
it had to be you.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.375
Another time,
another place,

37:34.461 --> 37:35.837
you and I--

37:35.921 --> 37:39.038
we really would have
been great together.

37:39.133 --> 37:43.547
But as it is,
I had to use you,

37:43.637 --> 37:45.548
just like your mother.

37:45.639 --> 37:46.924
- Shut up.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.631
- And just like Audrey.
- Shut up!

37:49.726 --> 37:53.093
- There we go,
that's the intensity I wanted to hear.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.099
- What?

37:55.190 --> 37:57.602
- Are you crying?

37:58.694 --> 38:01.652
Go ahead.
Look in a mirror.

38:19.465 --> 38:23.208
- What the hell
did you do to me?

38:23.302 --> 38:26.044
I touched someone today,
and I gave them a Trouble.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.878
- That was an hour ago.

38:27.973 --> 38:31.682
If your eyes and tears are black,
then I've done it.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.145
I've pushed you
to the next level.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.891
I had to set you off, Duke.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.722
The Troubles are
based on emotion,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.899
so you needed
some big ones.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.228
- What the hell
did you do to me?

38:44.323 --> 38:45.654
- You’ll see.

38:45.741 --> 38:49.529
I really am sorry, Duke.

38:49.620 --> 38:53.283
But you really are
kind of awesome now.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.596
(P.A. announcement
in background)

39:15.604 --> 39:18.186
- How you doing?
- I lost my keys.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.855
- Can I help you look for them?
- They'll turn up.

39:20.943 --> 39:25.027
I'm just such
an absentminded professor.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.729
Smart about my subject
but dunderheaded

39:27.824 --> 39:30.110
when it comes
to the real world.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.284
- About that, uh,

39:32.371 --> 39:35.283
that's why I came here
to talk to you.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.660
- You want to go back
to being professional.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.958
- Actually, no, I, uh...

39:43.048 --> 39:46.165
I haven't had this conversation
in a long time.

39:47.928 --> 39:52.467
Okay, uh,
I care about you a lot.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.298
And we're both adults,

39:54.393 --> 39:57.135
and I think we can still work
together well professionally,

39:57.229 --> 40:00.471
and I want to keep
doing it.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.648
- (laughs)

40:02.734 --> 40:05.020
- I'm making this
sound great.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.494
- Are we interrupting
something?

40:20.586 --> 40:21.917
- Yeah.

40:22.004 --> 40:24.746
- That's too bad.
- What's going on?

40:26.258 --> 40:29.000
- Where did you get this?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.709
- You broke into my car?

40:30.804 --> 40:34.092
- The CDC has no idea
that you're here.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.345
- Your DNA doesn't match
the real Charlotte Cross'.

40:37.436 --> 40:40.849
- Oh, come on.
- Why are you spying on me?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.679
- Because I'm trying
to treat you.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.389
- You're not even
who you say you are.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.442
- Wow, you're one to talk.
- Dwight.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.315
- You don't find it ironic
that you're the one

40:49.406 --> 40:50.612
questioning
Charlotte's identity?

40:50.699 --> 40:54.157
- Shut up, Dwight.
- No, please.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.860
Audrey's condition might be
the key to the cure.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.195
- Keep going.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.871
- I'm tired of protecting
one person

40:59.958 --> 41:01.289
at the expense
of this entire town.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.209
The original Audrey--
her name's Mara.

41:04.296 --> 41:07.504
This Audrey split off from her,
part of a Trouble.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.216
- And Mara?

41:11.303 --> 41:14.136
- Out there somewhere,
causing havoc.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.927
And I have to admit,
I like our Audrey much better.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.258
And I'm sorry it came to this,

41:19.353 --> 41:22.095
but why won't you
let her help us?

41:24.149 --> 41:26.105
- Because she's clever.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.150
Like Mara.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.073
- Charlotte?

41:32.157 --> 41:33.738
- I want my ring.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.441
- I'm not giving this to you
until you tell us what's going on.

41:36.536 --> 41:40.825
- I'll tell you everything,
but first I want my ring back.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.918
Nathan,
will you hand it to me?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.997
I promise...

41:50.092 --> 41:52.003
You'll know why in a moment.

42:06.191 --> 42:09.683
This ring--
it's part of a set.

42:09.778 --> 42:13.487
Every member
in our family has one.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.441
- Parker.

42:17.536 --> 42:18.992
I can feel her.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.201
- Of course you can.

42:24.334 --> 42:25.915
- Who are you?

42:29.005 --> 42:30.870
- I'm your mother.

42:40.600 --> 42:40.634
J‘J‘

42:40.642 --> 42:43.554
J‘J‘
