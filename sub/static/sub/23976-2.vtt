Hap and Leonard

00:02.174 --> 00:04.922
Oh oh oh,
you crack smoking mother.

00:10.109 --> 00:11.586
Went down to Grovetown
the other day.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.164
I want you to go down there
and bring her home.

00:13.190 --> 00:14.583
I do this for you,

00:14.609 --> 00:16.773
you gotta let Leonard
out of jail now.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.703
Tonight.

00:17.729 --> 00:19.328
Grovetown don't like black folk.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.095
Klan's alive and kickin' there.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.375
Place look like a goddamn
Hallmark card.

00:23.401 --> 00:25.984
I'm beginning to appreciate
the quaintness of this town.

Coulda just said
you didn't want no chicken.

03:28.549 --> 03:32.218
Whatcha doin' sittin' around in
your drawers with a gun, nohow?

03:33.109 --> 03:35.279
And, my God, man,
cross your legs or somethin'.

03:35.305 --> 03:37.429
Nobody wants to see your damn balls.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.437
That not why
you came out here?

03:44.148 --> 03:45.906
Why did you come out here?

03:46.549 --> 03:49.194
Eh, wife caught me
smoking in the garage.

03:49.220 --> 03:51.687
Figured I'd take a ride,
lay low till she cooled down.

03:51.903 --> 03:53.004
Yeah.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.760
Eh, I figured I'd check on you.

03:57.922 --> 03:59.357
Went by Leonard's place first.

03:59.383 --> 04:01.580
Them friends of his
said he was sleeping.

04:05.568 --> 04:07.257
Jesus, Hap.

04:07.810 --> 04:10.700
You look like the dead ass
of a roadkill possum.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.206
Was Sneed.

04:19.115 --> 04:20.466
How's that?

04:21.321 --> 04:22.719
In Grovetown.

04:24.822 --> 04:27.140
Sneed was in Grovetown.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.771
_

04:47.191 --> 04:48.711
That's really not nice.

04:50.318 --> 04:52.425
What the hell are you doin' here, Sneed?

04:53.116 --> 04:54.318
I work here.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.973
I heard you got fired from LaBorde.

04:58.283 --> 04:59.755
I resigned.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.519
What brings you two to Grovetown?

05:02.664 --> 05:05.274
Aw, got to missin'
your pretty tight ass.

05:05.548 --> 05:07.565
Thought I'd come by and have me a look.

05:08.073 --> 05:09.321
But don't worry.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.113
Wasn't worth the drive.

05:12.070 --> 05:13.349
Officer Reynolds,

05:13.460 --> 05:16.325
meet Hap Collins and Leonard Pine.

05:16.448 --> 05:18.921
Pine's the "Smartest Black Man
in the World."

05:19.336 --> 05:20.757
I got this, Sneed.

05:21.092 --> 05:22.179
Yes, ma'am.

05:25.137 --> 05:26.379
This your car?

05:28.518 --> 05:29.867
What's left of it.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.460
Did you know you are illegally parked?

05:44.556 --> 05:46.101
Uh, uh, no.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.053
No, I-I didn't.

05:48.185 --> 05:49.835
I'm gonna have to write you up for that.

05:54.287 --> 05:58.007
I-Is... Is there anything else
about this car you notice?

05:59.082 --> 06:01.887
We'll get a tow truck
to move it to a garage.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.769
Welcome to Grovetown.

06:09.835 --> 06:11.365
Thank you, ma'am.

06:15.213 --> 06:17.429
That's Officer Reynolds to you.

06:18.105 --> 06:19.520
I appreciate it.

06:22.203 --> 06:23.742
Officer Reynolds.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.620
Sneed, you can drive these boys
to Rocket's.

06:29.202 --> 06:30.435
Yes, ma'am.

06:37.789 --> 06:40.706
Nice little town you found
yourself back there, Sneed.

06:41.553 --> 06:43.542
Friendly as a rattlesnake.

06:44.521 --> 06:47.101
I didn't exactly have
the best references.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.268
Shoulda asked me.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.909
Look, I made some mistakes
back in LaBorde,

06:56.672 --> 06:57.874
and I'm sorry for it...

06:58.877 --> 07:01.156
especially about me and you, Leonard.

07:02.562 --> 07:04.250
Truth is, after what happened,

07:04.691 --> 07:06.491
I had a long look in the mirror,

07:07.070 --> 07:08.700
and I didn't like what I saw.

07:08.994 --> 07:11.457
I wish I could go back
and change it, but...

07:12.695 --> 07:15.273
life just moves forward, don't it?

07:16.469 --> 07:18.260
So let me ask you a question.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.247
Just who are you?

07:20.567 --> 07:23.170
And where's that turd stain
that was just driving us?

07:25.477 --> 07:27.280
Look, I just wanted to say it.

07:28.053 --> 07:29.434
You believe what you want.

07:32.484 --> 07:34.918
You never did tell me
what you're here for.

07:35.754 --> 07:37.619
Looking for Florida Grange.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.133
Came down here on a business trip.

07:41.029 --> 07:43.021
Never made it back to LaBorde.

07:43.319 --> 07:45.384
Now nobody knows where she is.

07:45.698 --> 07:46.710
That's funny.

07:48.053 --> 07:49.379
Define "funny."

07:49.434 --> 07:50.602
I heard she left town.

07:50.628 --> 07:51.896
From who?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.405
Chief Cantuck.

07:54.594 --> 07:56.953
He's the boss man down here.

08:03.898 --> 08:06.458
_

08:08.229 --> 08:09.863
Whatcha want ya
for Christmas, huh?

08:09.889 --> 08:11.257
You want
your little Hula-Hoop?

08:11.283 --> 08:12.304
All right, look,

08:12.330 --> 08:14.312
you don't tug on
Santa's whiskers, now.

08:14.338 --> 08:16.573
Take away Santa's beard,
he ain't nothin' but a man.

08:17.226 --> 08:18.765
You ever seen a hairless cat?

08:18.791 --> 08:20.648
Just bald head to tail.

08:21.036 --> 08:23.710
You babies
remember Aunt Peg? Huh?

08:23.736 --> 08:26.476
Oh, look at you two,
all growed up!

08:26.502 --> 08:28.429
You gonna go make some shadow
puppets and, uh...

08:28.455 --> 08:30.429
That's the sorriest Santa I ever saw.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.025
He's gonna scare the kids.

08:32.051 --> 08:33.653
I told him to shower first,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.947
but he didn't wanna
mess with his hair.

08:36.214 --> 08:38.291
Officer, you mind
keepin' an eye on these two?

08:38.442 --> 08:39.816
Of course.

08:39.842 --> 08:42.544
Not like I'm trying to run
a police station or any...

08:42.571 --> 08:44.397
- Thank you, Peg.
- What I got?

08:44.423 --> 08:45.411
Detective Blank.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.771
My office.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.965
All right. Come on, now.
Love "Santy's" neck.

08:48.991 --> 08:50.259
There you go.

08:50.285 --> 08:52.620
That's a...
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

08:52.966 --> 08:54.908
Merry Christmas.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.973
Glad I kept the receipt.

09:01.335 --> 09:03.243
Get that suit from Goodwill?

09:03.269 --> 09:05.471
Mm.
It's only been worn a few times.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.544
Besides, beats the hell out of

09:07.570 --> 09:09.449
spendin' the day
with the wife and in-laws.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.333
You know what she got me
for Christmas?

09:11.359 --> 09:14.187
- What's that?
- Carton of nicotine gum.

09:17.296 --> 09:18.864
You heard from Hap Collins?

09:19.025 --> 09:20.727
No, but I went by Leonard's.

09:20.753 --> 09:22.735
He's got a couple chuckle-heads
watching the place.

09:22.761 --> 09:25.705
Seems he took him a little trip
to Grovetown with Hap.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.999
God damn it, Charlie.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.062
When were you gonna tell me about that?

09:28.088 --> 09:30.029
Well, I just found out about it.

09:30.803 --> 09:31.970
Shit.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.205
What'd you think was gonna happen,

09:33.231 --> 09:34.914
them two sewed together at the dicks?

09:34.940 --> 09:36.340
Hell, I knew they were dumb.

09:36.366 --> 09:37.918
I didn't think that they were that dumb.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.274
Never underestimate their dumbness.

09:40.868 --> 09:42.856
Anyway, you don't need me anymore,

09:42.882 --> 09:44.993
I got to go out and make merry.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.093
You know, uh, it ain't my place
to say maybe, but, uh...

09:55.236 --> 09:57.337
I don't believe I'd sent
Hap Collins down there,

09:57.363 --> 09:58.454
it was me.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.960
Shit happens down there.

10:00.303 --> 10:02.038
Thank you, Charlie.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.766
Chief Cantuck wants you
to handle this one,

11:31.833 --> 11:34.282
being how he's your people and all.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.140
Wants him buried quick.

11:36.437 --> 11:37.971
What's the hurry?

11:39.024 --> 11:40.603
He ain't goin' nowhere.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.288
Just clean him up
and get him in the ground.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.710
No autopsy?

11:46.046 --> 11:47.757
No reason for it.

11:58.891 --> 12:00.626
How long you plannin' on
being here?

12:00.652 --> 12:02.821
Long as we have to,
not a minute more.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.410
He means
until we find Florida.

12:05.531 --> 12:07.466
She was here, somebody'd know it.

12:08.304 --> 12:10.166
Ain't the kinda place
a black woman on her own

12:10.192 --> 12:11.456
wouldn't stand out.

12:11.482 --> 12:12.824
We'll see.

12:15.649 --> 12:16.850
As soon as your car's fixed,

12:16.876 --> 12:18.760
you best be on your way, you hear?

12:34.487 --> 12:35.812
Ain't nobody here.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.190
I mean, it is Christmas.

12:41.744 --> 12:42.745
Leonard.

12:43.270 --> 12:44.429
Yeah?

12:45.108 --> 12:47.573
Sneed was laughin' at us, wasn't he?

12:48.274 --> 12:49.523
Aw, no, Hap.

12:49.818 --> 12:52.062
Probably on his way back to
the orphanage right now

12:52.088 --> 12:53.521
to go do some volunteer work.

12:53.547 --> 12:54.902
What you think?

12:55.797 --> 12:57.312
Think he's still laughin' at us.

12:57.338 --> 12:58.939
All the way back to town.

12:58.965 --> 13:01.695
And it's a long way back to town.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.734
I don't know about you, Hap,

13:12.760 --> 13:14.367
but I sure am startin'
to like this place.

13:14.602 --> 13:16.377
Oh, it's like "Mayberry"...

13:16.935 --> 13:18.617
meets "Deliverance."

13:19.358 --> 13:21.710
Reminds me of the kind of place that

13:21.736 --> 13:24.539
bad shit'd happen to black folk
when I was a kid.

13:24.565 --> 13:26.587
I hate to bust
your liberal bubble, Hap,

13:26.613 --> 13:28.804
but bad shit's still happenin'
to black people.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.687
I don't like the idea that

13:30.713 --> 13:32.781
Florida is down here on her own.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.955
Don't go underestimatin'
the power of

13:34.981 --> 13:36.820
a strong, black, educated woman.

13:36.846 --> 13:38.933
Probably holed up on the
black side of town right now,

13:38.959 --> 13:40.393
havin' a turkey dinner.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.523
- You seen the black side of town?
- Hell yeah.

13:42.549 --> 13:45.078
It's usually near the city dump,
sewage plant,

13:45.104 --> 13:47.240
nuclear reactor
if they got one.

13:47.266 --> 13:48.867
Or maybe we passed her
on the way up here

13:48.893 --> 13:50.585
and she poundin' that puddin'
to old Hanson

13:50.611 --> 13:52.026
one more time 'fore Christmas.

13:52.052 --> 13:53.698
Are you pedalin' back there?

13:53.739 --> 13:56.042
Hell yeah!
Tryin' to make up for yo ass!

13:56.669 --> 13:57.718
Damn!

14:15.386 --> 14:18.556
I been thinkin' about what
you said in the car last night.

14:22.533 --> 14:23.567
You remember?

14:28.392 --> 14:29.927
You said you met the Devil.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.367
Look like you lost this one.

15:58.396 --> 16:00.464
Cheap insulation do it every time.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.609
Yeah.
Damn shame.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.435
I found these Elvis cards, though,

16:05.461 --> 16:07.095
so it's not a total loss.

16:07.204 --> 16:09.940
Soon as the heat gets off 'em,
I might just keep these.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.065
Why?

16:11.984 --> 16:13.445
'Cause Elvis is on 'em.

16:14.859 --> 16:16.640
You wanna grab that

16:17.159 --> 16:18.664
ace of Elvis there for me?

16:23.657 --> 16:25.559
Hey, hey.
Head up here.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.028
What are you lookin' at?

16:27.458 --> 16:29.626
That ain't my dick
you're dreamin' on there.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.722
I've got a twisted nut.

16:32.323 --> 16:35.687
It's about to blow up
like goddamn Hiroshima.

16:37.044 --> 16:39.010
I-I'm Hap Collins,
and this is...

16:39.036 --> 16:40.436
I know who you are.

16:40.503 --> 16:42.672
Heard someone tinkered
with your automobile.

16:43.101 --> 16:46.243
They stuck a... um, an American
flag through the windshield.

16:46.450 --> 16:47.867
Patriotic fervor.

16:48.112 --> 16:49.996
Runs strong around here.

16:50.151 --> 16:52.328
There's some strong words
on the car, too.

16:52.657 --> 16:54.159
I'd have blushed if I could.

16:54.185 --> 16:55.518
What do you expect?

16:55.585 --> 16:57.488
You two girls come waltzin' in here,

16:57.514 --> 16:59.499
holding hands, riding that bike.

17:00.388 --> 17:02.840
People don't cotton
that kind of shit down here.

17:02.993 --> 17:05.679
We just lookin' for a friend of
ours, Florida Grange.

17:05.704 --> 17:06.803
Colored gal.

17:06.829 --> 17:09.131
That depends on what color you meanin'.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.969
You go on like that all day,
or you got an "off" button?

17:12.036 --> 17:14.373
No, he... he... he's just
worried about Florida

17:15.015 --> 17:17.061
'cause, uh, see, she's...

17:17.088 --> 17:18.390
uh, she's his sister.

17:21.488 --> 17:22.857
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's my sister,

17:22.883 --> 17:24.615
- and I'm worried sick about her.
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.198 --> 17:26.491
Your sister, huh?

17:26.517 --> 17:28.828
- That's right.
- They both work for me.

17:29.273 --> 17:31.287
Uh, she came down here to do
some business, and...

17:31.354 --> 17:33.957
and we ain't heard from her since and...

17:34.024 --> 17:36.796
And it's Christmas, and it...
it's the only family I got.

17:39.003 --> 17:40.370
When I was just a little kid,

17:40.396 --> 17:41.998
I tore the ass out
of a few chickens

17:42.024 --> 17:43.734
puttin' the old dick to 'em.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.200
Got so every time my mama found
a dead chicken lyin' around,

17:48.226 --> 17:50.024
she'd take the belt to me.

17:50.910 --> 17:52.583
She'd hear a pig squeal at night,

17:52.609 --> 17:54.828
and she'd come to my room
and whup me.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.542
A-A-A-And your point is?

17:59.983 --> 18:01.390
My point is...

18:02.748 --> 18:05.654
I'd put the old dick to anything
that ain't nailed down,

18:05.680 --> 18:06.715
and if I'd do a chicken,

18:06.741 --> 18:09.210
I'd sure as hell do a colored gal.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.882
And that ol' Florida Grange,

18:13.313 --> 18:16.070
she's a way lot better-lookin'
than a chicken.

18:17.257 --> 18:19.305
Must've been hard livin' with a...

18:19.594 --> 18:22.564
sister lookin' that fine.

18:22.672 --> 18:24.274
I'll bet you thought about

18:24.300 --> 18:27.130
puttin' old Moby Dick to her
more than once, huh?

18:29.504 --> 18:31.273
French kiss your mama
with that mouth?

18:31.340 --> 18:32.904
Don't you talk about my mama, boy.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.117
I ain't your boy.
I served my country

18:35.143 --> 18:37.445
so that your little
swollen-nut ass could live free.

18:37.471 --> 18:39.882
Then don't you lie to me about
her bein' your sister

18:39.908 --> 18:41.656
and that she works for this

18:41.682 --> 18:43.345
bleedin'-heart mechanic.

18:44.449 --> 18:46.437
I'm the law in this shithole.

18:47.407 --> 18:50.132
And you best remember that, boy.

18:55.986 --> 18:57.616
In my office.

19:03.599 --> 19:04.833
Shit.

19:05.374 --> 19:07.255
Don't you boys take me for a fool

19:07.281 --> 19:08.726
just 'cause I got a choked nut.

19:08.989 --> 19:11.203
I'm the goddamn Chief of Police,

19:11.559 --> 19:13.611
and that deserves some respect.

19:13.936 --> 19:15.805
Now, I'm gonna tell you this once.

19:15.856 --> 19:17.714
That colored lawyer,
she came down here

19:17.740 --> 19:20.046
to do some business
over at the radio station.

19:20.101 --> 19:22.369
She done it.
She's gone.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.338
That's it.

19:24.547 --> 19:27.616
Hear the Klan runnin' really
strong down here in Grovetown.

19:27.642 --> 19:30.226
Yeah, they're an ignorant bunch
of mean bastards,

19:30.252 --> 19:31.646
but I'm meaner.

19:32.345 --> 19:35.094
And they know what they can
and cannot do.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.228
So if you're thinkin'
what I think you're thinkin',

19:38.295 --> 19:39.802
you can think again.

19:42.674 --> 19:44.140
That's a lot of thinkin'.

19:50.837 --> 19:52.232
Are you smartin' me, son?

19:53.442 --> 19:54.632
No sir.

19:55.341 --> 19:57.575
I just want to find my friend, go home.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.882
And I told you she's gone.

20:00.525 --> 20:02.827
Now get your dumb, white ass,
and get your smart friend,

20:02.853 --> 20:04.336
and get out of my vehicle.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.224
I don't wanna ever see you lookin' at

20:08.291 --> 20:10.507
or talkin' about my balls again.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.430
It's a sensitive subject.

20:16.390 --> 20:17.578
Just so you know...

20:18.526 --> 20:21.170
I never raped a chicken in my life.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.755
I just figured that was the sort
of thing you expect me to say

20:23.781 --> 20:26.515
because that's the way
you do-gooders think.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.680
So...

20:30.922 --> 20:32.589
Did you do the pigs?

20:33.928 --> 20:35.726
Get out of my car, swiftie.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.047
- Pull over, pull over.
- Brakes here aren't so good.

22:06.115 --> 22:08.384
- Aw, shit. Wait!
- Damn. God damn it!

22:08.458 --> 22:10.860
<i>Who says there's no room
for the blues on Christmas,</i>

22:10.920 --> 22:12.321
<i>am I right?</i>

22:12.387 --> 22:13.888
<i>Of course I'm right.</i>

22:13.955 --> 22:15.890
<i>That was a blast from the past</i>

22:15.958 --> 22:18.494
<i>to jingle your bells
and warm you up fast.</i>

22:18.560 --> 22:20.361
Merry Christmas to one and all.

22:20.429 --> 22:22.331
Here's your main man Sonny Knox

22:22.357 --> 22:25.260
comin' 'atcha all the way
from the North Pole,

22:25.286 --> 22:27.822
home of the one, the only 96.6,

22:27.970 --> 22:29.939
<i>your Blues Fix Radio.</i>

22:30.006 --> 22:32.907
We are one week away from
saying goodbye to the '80s,

22:32.974 --> 22:34.909
<i>and as we do every year,</i>

22:34.935 --> 22:36.117
<i>we are going to play</i>

22:36.143 --> 22:38.898
the greatest blues songs of the century.

22:38.938 --> 22:42.575
Tune in bright and early with
me, your host, Sonny Knox.

22:42.810 --> 22:44.144
<i>Sonny Knox.</i>

22:44.211 --> 22:47.604
Here's one that'll really
tangle your tinsel,

22:47.630 --> 22:50.266
<i>comin' 'atcha by Alabama Slim.</i>

23:01.093 --> 23:03.830
My hand to God,
when I took this place over,

23:03.897 --> 23:05.631
it was on its last leg.

23:05.657 --> 23:07.459
Now I'm broadcast in three states

23:07.485 --> 23:09.679
from Bumbleshitsburg Grovetown.

23:09.811 --> 23:12.347
So I'm talkin' to the boys
up in Nashville...

23:14.207 --> 23:16.944
Sonny Knox, got blues in my socks.

23:17.011 --> 23:19.212
Just a reminder...
in the mood for comfort?

23:19.279 --> 23:21.923
Keith's Sofa Barn off Route 59

23:21.949 --> 23:24.116
offers widest selection of recliners

23:24.142 --> 23:25.844
at a price that can't be beat.

23:25.994 --> 23:27.770
- Speaking of beats,
- Were we?

23:27.796 --> 23:30.190
here's a gem from
Porterhouse Clemens.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.034
So, anyway, I'm thinkin' of
moving up there.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.455
That's the big time.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.482
Then these Bible-thumpin',
shit-kickin' racist moose dicks

23:37.508 --> 23:38.610
will really miss me.

23:38.636 --> 23:39.803
Sonny, we just need to find out

23:39.829 --> 23:41.932
what you know about Florida Grange.

23:42.136 --> 23:44.504
Oh, she was here,
day before last.

23:44.530 --> 23:47.240
Almost did a deal with her and
her client, Bobby Joe Soothe.

23:47.872 --> 23:49.241
What, Soothe?

23:49.575 --> 23:51.679
- Any relation to L.C.?
- Grandson.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.513
He came in here the other day
lookin' like he took a dump

23:54.539 --> 23:55.874
and found gold in the bowl.

23:57.435 --> 24:00.296
Said he had this long-lost
recording of his granddaddy,

24:00.322 --> 24:02.585
the late, great L.C. Soothe.

24:02.632 --> 24:04.753
Last song he recorded before he died.

24:04.971 --> 24:06.606
Found it in the great aunt's attic.

24:06.632 --> 24:09.085
Some say it's the greatest
blues song ever.

24:09.111 --> 24:11.112
Nobody even knew a recording existed

24:11.138 --> 24:13.108
until Bobby Joe walked in here
the other day

24:13.134 --> 24:14.601
offerin' to sell it.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.438
If it was the real thing,

24:16.506 --> 24:18.208
worth a fortune.

24:18.454 --> 24:19.811
Think it was the real deal?

24:21.056 --> 24:23.671
In my humble but expert opinion,

24:24.484 --> 24:25.593
it was.

24:26.667 --> 24:27.724
So what happened?

24:27.882 --> 24:28.952
Nothin'.

24:28.978 --> 24:31.122
Bobby Joe said he'd talk to his lawyer,

24:31.148 --> 24:32.494
this Miss Grange.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.676
We arranged a meeting,
I got the cash ready,

24:34.757 --> 24:36.793
then Bobby Joe dropped off the map.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.462
Haven't seen her
since they found the body.

24:39.856 --> 24:41.030
- Body?
- Body?

24:41.407 --> 24:42.699
You guys didn't hear?

24:42.766 --> 24:45.416
They found Bobby Joe
hangin' off the Grovetown bridge

24:45.442 --> 24:46.442
two days ago.

24:46.597 --> 24:48.238
Wait.
He... He... He dead?

24:48.430 --> 24:49.928
Deader than a dodo bird.

24:49.998 --> 24:52.910
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that curse was real.

24:53.069 --> 24:54.681
Curse?
What... What curse?

24:54.818 --> 24:57.287
Folks say whoever listens to
that song is cursed.

24:57.439 --> 24:59.174
But I listened to it.
Look at me.

24:59.242 --> 25:01.277
I don't believe in any of that crap.

25:01.303 --> 25:02.804
I believe in three things...

25:02.830 --> 25:05.322
music, business,
and the great American dollar.

25:05.348 --> 25:07.266
- <i>It's Sonny here. 96.6.</i>
- Curses? Come on. Bullshit.

25:07.292 --> 25:09.627
<i>Leave a message.</i>

25:09.653 --> 25:12.051
<i> Mr. Knox, this is
the Grovetown Fire Department.</i>

25:12.140 --> 25:13.650
<i>Call us as soon as you can.</i>

25:13.898 --> 25:16.630
<i>We regret to inform you
your house just burnt down.</i>

25:17.160 --> 25:18.445
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

25:19.145 --> 25:20.242
My house is...

25:20.268 --> 25:21.793
My Elvis cards!

25:21.819 --> 25:23.754
My Elvis cards!

25:26.044 --> 25:27.078
Damn.

25:27.555 --> 25:28.858
Somethin' ain't right, Hap.

25:28.884 --> 25:30.481
Nope. It ain't.

25:30.793 --> 25:33.395
Florida came down here
to meet with a client,

25:33.962 --> 25:35.435
and he turns up dead?

25:35.461 --> 25:36.629
And now she's gone?

25:36.901 --> 25:38.202
Why didn't Old Swollen Nuts

25:38.269 --> 25:39.837
tell us that Bobby Joe was dead?

25:39.904 --> 25:42.817
Mm. Playin' them Elvis cards
close to the vest.

25:43.073 --> 25:44.676
Maybe he has somethin'
to do with it...

25:45.222 --> 25:48.222
ring in the new year with
a little cracker-cop pastime.

25:49.038 --> 25:50.647
What I'd like to know is

25:51.080 --> 25:54.318
what's a guy doin' with a
recording worth that much money,

25:55.405 --> 25:57.721
and he ends up swingin' from a bridge?

25:57.934 --> 25:59.660
Maybe he ain't had no choice
in the matter.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.164
Why do I get the feeling that
people are watching us?

26:09.007 --> 26:10.377
That's 'cause they are.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.788
I'm startin' to get that
"Twilight Zone" feeling again.

26:30.624 --> 26:32.952
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna call Hanson.

26:34.052 --> 26:36.359
Play it cool now, buddy...

26:36.958 --> 26:38.274
real cool.

26:56.398 --> 26:58.257
Hi.
How you doin', ma'am?

27:01.791 --> 27:02.905
Uh...

27:03.620 --> 27:05.367
like to order some food.

27:09.749 --> 27:11.749
Two pulled pork sandwiches,

27:12.223 --> 27:13.664
some side of slaw,

27:14.278 --> 27:15.898
two Dr. Peppers.

27:16.192 --> 27:17.643
Two pigs on bread with slaw.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.577
Make that to go.

27:26.392 --> 27:28.195
I left a message for Hanson.

27:28.404 --> 27:29.957
He's gonna call us back here.

27:30.187 --> 27:31.488
I hope he's quick.

27:31.642 --> 27:34.264
Mm.
Oh, ma'am, uh...

27:36.117 --> 27:37.710
Lookin' for this lady.

27:38.487 --> 27:39.875
Seen her anywhere?

27:40.666 --> 27:41.890
Don't recall.

27:42.476 --> 27:43.578
Sorry.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.807
Right.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.804
What you doin' with him?

27:56.496 --> 27:58.085
He work for you?

27:58.669 --> 27:59.980
Billy.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.054
They're just getting some food.

28:02.109 --> 28:04.178
I'm just talkin' to 'em, Mama.

28:05.082 --> 28:06.261
So?

28:08.529 --> 28:11.468
Actually, uh, I work for him.

28:12.343 --> 28:13.424
What?

28:13.450 --> 28:15.279
Yeah.
Uh, we're, uh...

28:16.400 --> 28:17.679
We're GE's.

28:18.287 --> 28:19.461
Huh?

28:19.721 --> 28:22.782
It's Government Exterminators.

28:24.124 --> 28:26.492
Yeah, w-we just got in
from LaBorde.

28:27.096 --> 28:30.117
See, uh, LaBorde's been overrun...

28:33.709 --> 28:35.370
...by Christmas ants.

28:40.643 --> 28:42.252
Ain't never heard of no Christmas Ants.

28:42.278 --> 28:44.390
Mm. Neither did
people in LaBorde.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.632
Yeah, you see, uh, these ants,

28:47.658 --> 28:51.406
see, they ain't ordinary ants, no.

28:51.809 --> 28:53.077
Mutations.

28:53.257 --> 28:54.281
Yeah.

28:54.307 --> 28:55.575
They snuck over here

28:55.601 --> 28:58.718
on a boatload of mangos from the Congo.

29:00.663 --> 29:02.213
Yeah, that's why had to...

29:02.399 --> 29:04.713
to fly Dr. Bagoomba here

29:05.437 --> 29:06.639
in from Kenya.

29:07.417 --> 29:10.555
He's the world's leading
authority on Christmas Ants.

29:11.946 --> 29:13.339
Dr. Bagoomba?

29:13.743 --> 29:15.311
Why don't you fill these boys in on

29:15.337 --> 29:17.521
some of the horrors
you've seen back home?

29:24.774 --> 29:26.071
Uh...

29:28.281 --> 29:32.070
_

29:34.352 --> 29:35.813
_

29:37.383 --> 29:38.766
_

29:39.742 --> 29:41.479
_

29:41.505 --> 29:42.720
Oh, man.

29:42.867 --> 29:44.749
_

29:46.156 --> 29:49.234
_

29:49.345 --> 29:50.512
_

29:50.579 --> 29:51.647
Horrible.

29:51.673 --> 29:52.718
_

29:52.744 --> 29:53.570
Mm. Bad.

29:53.596 --> 29:54.648
_

29:55.690 --> 29:57.328
Bad.

29:57.354 --> 30:00.223
You, uh... You fellas
got some credentials?

30:03.293 --> 30:04.960
We, uh...

30:05.028 --> 30:06.662
I got a, uh...

30:06.729 --> 30:09.164
We... Aw. Did we... Did we leave
'em in the car?

30:11.205 --> 30:12.939
Excuse me, fellas.

30:13.042 --> 30:14.625
That's the government callin'.

30:21.539 --> 30:22.763
- Hanson?
- Talk to me.

30:22.789 --> 30:25.455
This is one backward place, man.

30:25.481 --> 30:27.549
- What about Florida? <i>
- I have no idea.</i>

30:27.835 --> 30:29.092
You know that guy that...

30:29.118 --> 30:31.020
that she was comin' down here to meet?

30:31.087 --> 30:32.690
Yeah, he's dead.

30:32.912 --> 30:35.687
<i>They found him hangin'
from the town bridge.</i>

30:37.493 --> 30:39.228
Hanson?
Hanson!

30:41.163 --> 30:42.665
I heard you.
I'm coming down there.

30:42.732 --> 30:44.299
Where are you and Leonard stayin'?

30:44.366 --> 30:46.135
<i>There's a garage on the way into town.</i>

30:46.202 --> 30:48.270
Th-There's this big-ass rocket
on the roof.

30:48.337 --> 30:49.663
You... You can't miss it, no.

30:49.689 --> 30:52.307
<i>I got to go.</i>
Uh, I'll meet you there.

30:52.333 --> 30:53.945
Hey.

30:54.011 --> 30:56.881
They spotted an army of those
ants 5 miles east of here.

30:56.907 --> 30:58.041
They're marching.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.683
In a column, two by two.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.317
Come on.
We gotta go.

31:04.701 --> 31:05.942
Enjoy, sirs.

31:06.679 --> 31:08.587
I made it special for you boys.

31:08.758 --> 31:10.453
Oh, and, hey...

31:11.393 --> 31:13.110
may the Force be with you.

31:13.215 --> 31:14.617
Godspeed.

31:14.947 --> 31:16.214
Go.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.568
Ants marchin' in a column two by two?

31:19.635 --> 31:21.740
- What the hell was that?
- Was a military touch.

31:21.766 --> 31:23.235
- I thought you'd appreciate it.
- Pbht!

31:23.261 --> 31:24.943
We had 'em until
you brought up the Pygmies.

31:24.969 --> 31:26.562
Oh, come on. Move.

31:26.879 --> 31:28.781
Son of a bitch!

31:28.807 --> 31:30.575
- Hey!
- Damn it!

31:30.642 --> 31:32.106
Come on!

31:32.154 --> 31:33.195
Hey!

31:33.669 --> 31:35.237
God damn!

31:35.429 --> 31:36.582
Get 'em!

31:36.649 --> 31:38.583
Get 'em!

31:47.025 --> 31:49.561
- Ah, there.
- Yeah.

31:49.628 --> 31:51.196
What's the plan?

31:51.263 --> 31:52.531
I don't know!
I was followin' you!

31:52.557 --> 31:54.692
Hey, you said, "Get in."

31:54.718 --> 31:56.887
I said "Get them," get the truck.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.792
What the hell is wrong wi'chu?

31:58.820 --> 32:00.760
Oh!
Oh, now, that makes more sense.

32:01.340 --> 32:02.708
So what we gonna do?

32:02.775 --> 32:03.842
I don't know.
It was your idea.

32:47.753 --> 32:49.756
You guys have a nice Christmas now.

33:09.039 --> 33:10.716
Nope.
I ain't seen her.

33:10.742 --> 33:12.555
I'd remember if I did...
good-lookin' woman.

33:13.002 --> 33:15.271
That's a different attitude
from most people around here.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.686
I like women.

33:16.712 --> 33:19.839
Mm, like 'em dark, light, fat,
skinny, short, tall.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.267
Dated a midget once...
like legitimate circus fare,

33:22.293 --> 33:25.023
but, uh, didn't last too long.
We didn't see eye to eye.

33:25.049 --> 33:26.282
Everybody always
laughs at that,

33:26.308 --> 33:27.757
but, no, for real,
she's crazy as hell.

33:27.783 --> 33:29.294
I ain't like other people in this town.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.987
Shit, I don't care
if your skin's purple,

33:31.013 --> 33:32.681
you got bones through your nose holes.

33:32.790 --> 33:35.157
You got any idea where
a woman like that might stay,

33:35.224 --> 33:37.404
uh, in a town like this?

33:37.828 --> 33:40.578
Mm... not in town,
that's for sure.

33:41.285 --> 33:42.698
Uh, maybe over on the Southside.

33:42.724 --> 33:44.042
That's the black part of town...

33:44.068 --> 33:46.169
not that I see it that way, but, mm...

33:46.195 --> 33:47.330
I toldja.

33:47.437 --> 33:49.105
Yeah, cross the railroad tracks.

33:49.173 --> 33:51.275
Caught me.

33:51.341 --> 33:53.209
Just doing a little light
readin'... articles.

33:54.837 --> 33:56.071
Sorry I can't help you out
with the lady,

33:56.097 --> 33:57.632
but I tell you what...

33:57.658 --> 33:59.592
why don't we call it a wash
on that bike?

33:59.618 --> 34:02.132
Car's gonna take me
a day or two, though.

34:02.891 --> 34:05.088
Oh, I see you're eyein' them
pickled pigs feet.

34:05.114 --> 34:08.150
I am runnin' a special
on these delicious morsels.

34:08.554 --> 34:11.166
Temptin'.
We got sandwiches, though.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.871
Say a couple of fellas needed
a place to stay the night,

34:16.132 --> 34:18.214
one of 'em happens to not be white...

34:19.139 --> 34:20.715
where might you suggest?

34:21.101 --> 34:24.148
Well, if it's the two gentlemen
standin' in front of me...

34:25.768 --> 34:27.302
...they're in luck.

34:30.947 --> 34:33.860
You might notice a faint smell
when you first get in!

34:34.318 --> 34:36.085
Tenants had a little run-in
with a Chihuahua

34:36.112 --> 34:37.880
and an oven little while back.

34:37.987 --> 34:39.675
You get used to it quick!

34:42.781 --> 34:44.819
How 'bout I throw in utilities?

34:44.893 --> 34:46.393
What utilities?

34:46.481 --> 34:47.683
That generator's gas.

34:47.797 --> 34:49.170
Don't run itself.

34:52.168 --> 34:55.184
Did I mention I'm the only place
that'll put y'all up?

35:02.390 --> 35:03.490
I'm taking the bed.

35:03.516 --> 35:05.085
My sciatica's starting to act up.

35:16.660 --> 35:18.593
Is it too late for me to stay home?

35:19.411 --> 35:21.401
Either way,
it's a home for the holidays.

35:22.475 --> 35:25.039
That boy ain't tellin' us
everything he knows.

35:25.179 --> 35:26.556
Damn grease monkey.

35:26.835 --> 35:29.265
Got oil between his teeth...
all 12 of 'em.

35:29.527 --> 35:31.552
Oh, he seemed nice enough to me.

35:31.691 --> 35:33.158
Least he was tryin'.

35:33.570 --> 35:35.987
Must be nice bein' white
and trustin' people.

35:37.531 --> 35:38.832
You know, man,

35:38.930 --> 35:40.242
sometimes,

35:40.637 --> 35:44.387
you are like a man standin'
in a hole, lookin' down.

35:44.413 --> 35:45.844
All you see is the dark.

35:45.988 --> 35:47.057
Ugh.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.250
What? What's up?

35:48.358 --> 35:50.926
Damn bed smell like eau de toilet.

35:50.952 --> 35:53.620
I'm sleepin' on the couch.
Crabs like dark meat.

35:54.476 --> 35:55.858
Suit yourself.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.182
Damn that sumbitch!

36:13.956 --> 36:14.990
Smell this!

36:16.378 --> 36:18.763
I know that smell is her perfume,

36:18.789 --> 36:19.906
you lyin' sack of shit!

36:19.932 --> 36:21.552
I don't know
what you're talkin' about!

36:21.578 --> 36:24.688
Florida Grange!
She was here!

36:27.544 --> 36:28.818
I'm tellin' you, she asked me

36:28.844 --> 36:30.599
not to let anyone know
she was stayin' here.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.175
That... That's why I lied.

36:32.201 --> 36:33.681
Why the hell would she do that?

36:33.748 --> 36:35.484
Said she just went through
a bad breakup,

36:35.510 --> 36:36.910
didn't want her ex to know
where she was.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.027
How long was she here?

36:38.053 --> 36:39.164
Just that one night.

36:40.788 --> 36:42.991
You wouldn't happen to be lyin'
to us again, now, would ya?

36:43.058 --> 36:46.042
- Would ya?
- No, I-I swear on my poor mother's grave.

36:46.768 --> 36:47.895
She left that morning,

36:47.921 --> 36:49.828
and I ain't seen her since, honest.

36:49.948 --> 36:52.820
- She say where she was goin'?
- I dunno.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.497
Did she say where she was going?!

36:54.523 --> 36:56.453
I woke up that morning...
she was gone already.

36:56.479 --> 36:57.827
I was b-bein' straight up
with you fellas.

36:57.853 --> 36:59.398
Aw, come on.
All that talk about

36:59.424 --> 37:01.827
how much you love women
got me to thinkin' about you.

37:02.008 --> 37:03.642
I talk too much, I talk too much.

37:03.668 --> 37:05.162
I always have.
I...

37:05.420 --> 37:07.427
It was just talk.
It was just talk.

37:07.453 --> 37:09.202
That's... That's how come
I got no friends.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.939
Or maybe I talk too much
because I got no friends.

37:11.965 --> 37:13.132
'Cause I don't know.

37:13.199 --> 37:14.567
Maybe I get on people's nerves.

37:14.593 --> 37:16.168
You get on Florida's nerves?

37:17.716 --> 37:18.871
I ain't gonna lie.

37:18.938 --> 37:20.973
Yeah, I thought about
maybe makin' a play for her.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.007
Woman like that,
what man wouldn't?

37:23.476 --> 37:24.504
But...

37:26.513 --> 37:27.880
sort of puts a damper

37:27.947 --> 37:29.815
on the whole romance side of
things, don't it?

37:30.938 --> 37:33.343
Drop your pants,
woman sees this...

37:33.561 --> 37:35.162
Sort of thing you got to
come around to slowly,

37:35.188 --> 37:37.491
and she was only staying
the one night so...

37:37.831 --> 37:39.062
Pbht!

37:39.501 --> 37:41.932
You hear her mention a fella
named Bobby Joe Soothe?

37:43.713 --> 37:45.639
Fella that hung himself
from the bridge?

37:46.234 --> 37:47.833
No, she didn't mention him.

37:48.482 --> 37:49.869
Hung himself?

37:49.895 --> 37:51.448
That's what they're sayin'.

37:52.453 --> 37:53.684
Who's sayin'?

37:53.960 --> 37:55.023
The police are.

37:56.071 --> 37:58.404
But they got a funny relationship

37:58.430 --> 37:59.999
with the truth sometimes.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.379
"They are like a breath;

39:05.446 --> 39:07.920
their days are like
a fleeting shadow."

39:10.596 --> 39:11.936
Scripture.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.380
My daddy was a preacher.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.228
Was he now?

39:18.855 --> 39:19.937
Funny.

39:20.739 --> 39:21.758
What?

39:22.392 --> 39:23.602
Them folk,

39:24.154 --> 39:26.547
they care for their own,
same as we do ours.

39:28.168 --> 39:29.102
Yeah?

39:29.168 --> 39:30.891
Yeah.

39:31.004 --> 39:32.969
Make 'em almost seem human.

39:33.674 --> 39:34.721
Doesn't it?

39:38.478 --> 39:40.681
They're human enough to mourn, I guess.

39:41.743 --> 39:42.790
Well,

39:43.774 --> 39:45.877
they say elephants mourn.

39:46.032 --> 39:47.667
That don't make them human.

39:52.372 --> 39:53.704
You got this?

39:54.941 --> 39:57.076
Yeah. I got it.

39:57.102 --> 39:58.905
Good.
I got better things to do

39:58.931 --> 40:01.166
than watch that shit
get put in the hole.

40:29.688 --> 40:30.984
I mean,
it'd make sense,

40:31.010 --> 40:32.586
her being on the Southside.

40:32.794 --> 40:35.352
Tell you the truth, I'd prefer
her with our own people.

40:35.510 --> 40:38.173
How come nobody has heard from her?

40:39.192 --> 40:42.129
Maybe Hanson ain't as honest
as we'd like him to be.

40:42.762 --> 40:44.832
Maybe Florida's not wantin'
no one to know

40:44.858 --> 40:46.793
where she at 'cause
a good reason.

40:46.901 --> 40:48.835
So you believe Tim's theory?

40:48.861 --> 40:51.227
I mean, Hanson's tough.

40:51.852 --> 40:53.322
But he holdin' on hard.

40:53.829 --> 40:55.408
I mean, just because
he actin' sincere

40:55.434 --> 40:57.357
don't mean he ain't
puttin' pressure on the girl

40:57.383 --> 40:59.320
to come back...
wife or no wife.

40:59.756 --> 41:01.552
Men be like that sometime.

41:02.798 --> 41:04.785
Man, I had no idea

41:04.811 --> 41:06.566
you knew so much about

41:07.016 --> 41:08.988
heterosexual relationships.

41:09.014 --> 41:12.071
Just like the gay ones,
just twisted.

41:13.726 --> 41:14.934
What if...

41:16.272 --> 41:18.922
What if he sent you here
to do his dirty work?

41:19.159 --> 41:21.548
Well, either way,
I'm doin' the dirty work.

41:22.206 --> 41:25.157
And either way,
I want to make sure she's safe.

41:25.698 --> 41:27.967
So tomorrow we go to the Southside.

41:28.034 --> 41:30.076
Oh, correction...
I'ma go to the Southside.

41:30.102 --> 41:31.245
You gonna stay here
and wait for Hanson.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.372
Unh-unh.
No, no, no, no.

41:32.439 --> 41:33.873
We both go to the Southside,

41:33.899 --> 41:35.310
and we...
we leave a note for Hanson.

41:35.336 --> 41:37.017
I am not
takin' your honky ass behind me.

41:37.043 --> 41:38.711
Them folk gonna clam up for sure.

41:38.737 --> 41:40.120
Hey, I took you to the white side.

41:40.146 --> 41:41.747
Well, that's different.
I'm handsome.

41:41.773 --> 41:44.691
Look, look, you get to
go in town and be white,

41:44.717 --> 41:46.753
do white people things...
play golf.

41:46.860 --> 41:48.227
Uh, you can get

41:48.253 --> 41:50.368
that Hall & Oates record
you always wanted.

41:50.756 --> 41:52.758
What if I find you
hangin' from a bridge?

41:52.784 --> 41:54.240
Look, just hope I find her

41:54.260 --> 41:56.847
and we can put this place
behind us in our rearview.

41:57.296 --> 41:59.245
I don't like splittin' up...

42:00.000 --> 42:01.782
especially in a place like this.

42:03.251 --> 42:04.836
I love you, too, Hap.

42:05.727 --> 42:07.765
But trust me on this.
I'ma be all right.

42:08.038 --> 42:09.371
Fine. Fine.

42:09.397 --> 42:11.065
Just sit down, sit down.

42:13.979 --> 42:14.981
Yeah.

42:17.118 --> 42:18.319
What's that?

42:19.042 --> 42:20.877
What?
I got somethin' in my teeth?

42:23.807 --> 42:25.266
Well, I'll be damned.
