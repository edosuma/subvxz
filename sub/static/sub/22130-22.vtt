IF YOU AND JUNIOR WANT TO
GET OUT OF THERE ALIVE,

18:09.044 --> 18:12.308
TAKE OFF THAT BACKPACK,
UNDO THE STRAPS,

21:13.794 --> 21:15.970
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
ATTRACTION, HUH.

IT'S NOT EVERYDAY YOU COME
ACROSS A COLD-BLOODED KILLER

21:19.843 --> 21:21.541
WITH SUCH WARMTH AND CHARM.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.501

22:10.067 --> 22:11.634
WHO DID YOU STEAL THEM FROM?

22:12.243 --> 22:15.029
