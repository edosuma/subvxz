00:54.434 --> 00:56.649
Cursed soldiers

01:47.281 --> 01:50.502
Second World War was a confrontation in five years

01:51.616 --> 01:54.015
German war machine controlled by Adolf Hitler

01:54.050 --> 01:56.509
A Nazi party strangled Europe

01:58.191 --> 02:00.439
From the coast of France to the borders of Russia

02:01.570 --> 02:04.119
FÃ¼hrer Heinrich Himmler was the commander of the division

02:05.558 --> 02:07.705
Called SS who were responsible

02:07.740 --> 02:10.442
The violent attacks against humanity

02:11.505 --> 02:13.998
SS were brutal and cruel Nazi

02:15.399 --> 02:17.701
A front against the army

02:18.421 --> 02:20.176
Many of them were not Nazis

02:20.211 --> 02:22.816
I condemned the abuse of SS
against the civilian population

02:24.992 --> 02:27.368
As a result, their relationship was sometimes

02:27.403 --> 02:29.020
Enemy

02:30.195 --> 02:33.143
SS Himmler controlled the institute scientist

02:33.178 --> 02:36.175
Conoccido as Ananerp

02:36.210 --> 02:39.896
Who was dedicated to the research of cultural and sociological

02:39.931 --> 02:42.096
Aryan Race

02:42.131 --> 02:44.356
Party, which was responsible for research purposes

02:44.391 --> 02:46.792
Hidden forces of the Third Reich

02:49.262 --> 02:51.941
In 1944, the tide has changed in Europe

02:52.680 --> 02:54.371
The German army was withdrawn

02:56.027 --> 02:57.915
With advanced weight

02:57.950 --> 03:00.500
The Russian Red Army

03:02.825 --> 03:05.326
Romania one thousand nine hundred forty-four

03:36.777 --> 03:38.770
It's execution

03:39.556 --> 03:41.675
SS

03:41.710 --> 03:43.706
Damn  SS

03:43.741 --> 03:45.653
Even the soldiers are

04:58.942 --> 05:00.698
Rapists Damn

05:08.562 --> 05:10.374
Keep

05:56.323 --> 05:58.428
The pressure must pressure

05:59.167 --> 06:00.837
Pressure here

06:08.395 --> 06:10.461
Morphine

07:49.344 --> 07:53.278
No one saw this bastard?
- No, all eyes were

07:53.313 --> 07:55.442
Busy

07:55.477 --> 07:58.100
I deserve it - this woman died like an animal

08:01.128 --> 08:03.546
Do not worry, no one can
escape his appearance

08:05.991 --> 08:08.311
No, only if his brain were smaller

08:09.092 --> 08:10.967
So you have to cap

08:39.385 --> 08:40.986
Motors

08:41.688 --> 08:43.533
Ambush

09:35.097 --> 09:36.777
Returns

10:16.384 --> 10:18.168
Agent Fletcher?

10:23.842 --> 10:25.544
Mayor

10:25.579 --> 10:28.069
Cr Black wants to see it, sir.

10:32.592 --> 10:34.591
Urgently

11:34.040 --> 11:36.331
I thought he was dead

11:36.806 --> 11:38.750
For all purposes, I am,

11:39.175 --> 11:41.901
My body still does not accept the fact

11:42.454 --> 11:44.060
Not been replaced?

11:44.476 --> 11:47.110
Who?
- H P returned

11:47.613 --> 11:49.904
Defense was, if we are lucky in days

11:51.649 --> 11:54.320
Do faith in God and
hopes and Health

12:00.568 --> 12:02.798
Meet the most Metzker

12:05.380 --> 12:07.418
Gentlemen sit down

12:17.326 --> 12:20.328
Lost a man today - Tromy

12:21.841 --> 12:24.782
We all have to make sacrifices for the good

12:24.817 --> 12:27.107
Who is the greater good?

12:28.038 --> 12:30.134
I want you to lead a mission

12:31.406 --> 12:33.122
rare

12:33.553 --> 12:35.674
Do you know the
woods High Butcher?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.688
Little - you know?

12:39.314 --> 12:41.096
Behind enemy lines

12:41.131 --> 12:43.250
As a result of the withdrawal of a different strategy

12:45.405 --> 12:47.529
And the story, of course

12:47.990 --> 12:49.916
Stories

12:50.469 --> 12:53.075
Do not fear death, right?

12:54.449 --> 12:56.626
Life scare me more

12:57.125 --> 12:59.207
Back to the forest

12:59.631 --> 13:01.735
I will be escorting
civilian scientist

13:02.890 --> 13:04.734
What is the goal?

13:06.625 --> 13:09.562
Civil to take in a certain place in the forest

13:14.552 --> 13:16.683
The civilian must return healthy

13:16.718 --> 13:18.536
Is that clear?

13:18.571 --> 13:20.527
Nothing is clear about what he
said, the defense will begin

13:20.562 --> 13:22.401
In the days

13:22.436 --> 13:25.252
The colonel asked one specific question

13:25.730 --> 13:29.419
What all this insane
suicide mission?

13:29.454 --> 13:32.202
I remember that he is older SS

13:32.237 --> 13:34.956
It should be treated with respect

13:41.465 --> 13:44.359
The priest is here

13:44.946 --> 13:48.312
Comes else?
- Yeah, okay, that among

13:49.016 --> 13:51.215
'S you, sir

13:57.291 --> 14:00.542
Professor Kaplan forgive Waiting man

14:01.096 --> 14:03.592
I am Colonel, I'm sorry to disappoint

14:04.060 --> 14:07.887
Presented the mayor Metzker
- It is an honor for me

14:09.293 --> 14:12.038
Your presence on this mission will be less boring

14:12.502 --> 14:14.576
A mayor Fletcher

14:17.625 --> 14:19.592
It is civil society?

14:20.063 --> 14:22.005
I have to escort the woman
behind enemy lines?

14:23.626 --> 14:25.547
We know that if the
Russians to capture?

14:26.628 --> 14:28.809
No options - This is madness

14:31.272 --> 14:33.964
I do not pretend to explain my duty

14:35.188 --> 14:37.911
I hanged a man for less

14:38.513 --> 14:41.143
I heard that only children hanging, the mayor

14:42.682 --> 14:45.091
He was lucky not to blame for treason once

14:45.552 --> 14:48.060
Butchers pay to do your job

14:48.095 --> 14:50.291
There is betrayal

14:50.326 --> 14:52.532
The possibility of questioning his orders?
- Gentlemen, please

14:52.567 --> 14:55.066
We should not reproach the mayor for being careful with their office

14:55.881 --> 14:57.547
With respect, Professor,
not her decision

15:00.688 --> 15:02.821
Mayor

15:03.261 --> 15:05.524
Read this, please

15:11.783 --> 15:14.014
He saw the signing

15:14.577 --> 15:17.210
FÃ¼hrer Himmler wants to do it

15:18.958 --> 15:21.646
What does it mean that my decision is so

15:22.167 --> 15:24.402
And we can get this mission

15:25.129 --> 15:28.302
Not so, most Metzker?
- Naturally

15:28.756 --> 15:31.665
The biggest you join us to
make sure that you do not

15:31.700 --> 15:34.152
Everything is done well

15:34.187 --> 15:36.158
Coronel, who is responsible for this mission

15:36.193 --> 15:39.268
When orders SIGA, you - and
their orders are to take

15:39.303 --> 15:41.884
Where do I want to go back and

15:43.859 --> 15:46.212
Otherwise, the mayor Metzker
will surely be happy

15:46.247 --> 15:48.620
Responsible to do

15:49.037 --> 15:51.318
Note that companies in this job

15:53.009 --> 15:56.655
Of course we all know what happens if the mission fails

16:02.775 --> 16:04.576
Sen today Professor

16:06.516 --> 16:08.287
Up early

16:44.005 --> 16:46.028
I hate the woods

16:47.003 --> 16:49.375
This is crazy women
should not wear

16:49.410 --> 16:51.216
Behind enemy lines

16:51.251 --> 16:53.181
The Russians are so worried

16:54.518 --> 16:56.570
What are you talking about?
- Nothing

16:57.771 --> 16:59.643
There is a whole company of paratroopers, who disappeared

17:03.389 --> 17:06.223
I do not know what happened?
- What happened

17:08.260 --> 17:10.585
It was in 42 - let Nick

17:11.061 --> 17:14.159
Company lands in forest

17:14.994 --> 17:19.210
What happened to them?

17:19.737 --> 17:21.411
Been lost

17:22.721 --> 17:25.132
They left before dawn

17:25.550 --> 17:27.493
Only one was seen

17:27.529 --> 17:29.209
Sergeant - What happened?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.180
It does not say Sergeant

17:33.529 --> 17:35.196
This is a very old

17:35.590 --> 17:37.094
I always wear the same uniform

17:38.766 --> 17:41.115
I spent several years
listening to silly story

17:42.845 --> 17:44.827
For the first time the property
- This is madness

17:45.969 --> 17:47.653
Maybe not so much

17:48.084 --> 17:50.026
Indians have the power and the

17:51.276 --> 17:54.504
For good and evil, friend
- Exactly

17:55.217 --> 17:57.254
Have the form of small male co-workers

17:57.289 --> 17:59.396
Nature generally have a good

17:59.431 --> 18:01.350
Sometimes there are bad

18:04.247 --> 18:06.502
I think that's enough for me

18:08.216 --> 18:11.203
These can occur and
be tested - you know?

18:12.463 --> 18:14.233
This teacher, he does

18:16.811 --> 18:18.602
Tell us

18:19.527 --> 18:22.469
She is Ananerp - Insurance

18:26.019 --> 18:28.805
What is it?
- Myth Ananerps in

18:29.234 --> 18:31.980
It is not unreasonable to think that they are true

18:32.970 --> 18:34.741
What?

18:38.456 --> 18:41.030
What?
- Maybe a hidden group

18:41.716 --> 18:43.996
Hidden?
- Not even start from the assumption

18:46.792 --> 18:48.749
What are they looking for?
- What?

18:49.914 --> 18:51.520
Whatever, the same

18:59.210 --> 19:02.253
Who wants us in the forest?
- Who cares who gave

19:02.288 --> 19:04.362
Order?
If someone returns to live this mission

19:04.397 --> 19:06.061
There are no mental health

19:09.063 --> 19:11.118
What are you talking about?
- Himmler likes

19:11.153 --> 19:13.045
Failure

19:49.776 --> 19:52.727
Do you know what you are
looking for in the woods?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.793
You're talking to me again and I'll cut your throat

20:26.989 --> 20:28.851
It is the teacher

20:33.177 --> 20:35.465
Well, here we go

20:37.300 --> 20:39.207
We cross here

20:39.242 --> 20:40.985
We can be there in two days

20:41.921 --> 20:44.390
Is the best way here it
is 5 miles to the forest

20:45.580 --> 20:47.423
I want to be on the trees before dawn

20:48.259 --> 20:50.032
Us in the face of the enemy only if it is absolutely

20:50.067 --> 20:52.090
Required

20:52.125 --> 20:53.845
Probably?
- Yes, sir

20:55.616 --> 20:57.486
Main

20:57.924 --> 20:59.870
This mission makes no sense

20:59.905 --> 21:04.573
No matter, all that matters back

21:04.608 --> 21:06.837
I do not want any of my
men to attack madness

21:06.872 --> 21:09.635
Applicants hacemoslo
ordered and left it all

22:28.434 --> 22:30.678
We entered, Major?

22:31.945 --> 22:33.772
We are exposed

23:12.152 --> 23:13.866
Where are you, Lieutenant?

23:14.402 --> 23:17.568
I'm PakstÃ¡n

23:19.434 --> 23:22.457
15 Romanian Jews found in Saltz

23:23.332 --> 23:25.661
It took 30 minutes to die

23:28.240 --> 23:30.626
Do you want to know where I come from?

23:31.015 --> 23:33.280
Even know where these things done

23:33.736 --> 23:35.593
Because I'm strong and weak

23:36.078 --> 23:37.891
'Re German soldier must know

23:38.351 --> 23:40.862
I prefer to shoot to commit such a crime

23:42.499 --> 23:44.672
Why do not you keep the bullet?

23:45.488 --> 23:48.071
Risks back with you and cut our

24:00.500 --> 24:02.191
Cholera

24:06.746 --> 24:09.339
He says the forest is owned

24:12.101 --> 24:14.048
There is

24:36.987 --> 24:38.744
Mayor

24:39.229 --> 24:41.189
Nothing

24:42.630 --> 24:43.681
Let - Yes, sir

24:43.716 --> 24:44.733
Are you angry?
- Not

25:07.385 --> 25:09.470
Do not know Please tell

25:09.505 --> 25:11.003
No matter

25:11.038 --> 25:12.894
I'm a soldier

25:12.929 --> 25:15.036
I have balls and lecturer

25:15.071 --> 25:16.910
Can I take your order

25:17.551 --> 25:19.169
In the meantime, stay with us

25:19.204 --> 25:21.123
For your own safety - Soldiers

25:39.476 --> 25:42.176
Identification?
- No, sir, but this

25:47.685 --> 25:49.745
German clothing
- A face

25:56.304 --> 25:58.166
God

26:05.107 --> 26:07.304
God

26:11.353 --> 26:13.092
SAquÃ©mosla here

26:23.018 --> 26:25.059
Who is it?

26:25.430 --> 26:27.557
Someone with the initials BD

26:29.553 --> 26:32.333
Recognize?
It means something to you?

26:34.208 --> 26:36.129
It seems surprised

26:37.176 --> 26:41.520
Really?
It may seem a surprise

26:42.853 --> 26:44.938
But not every day I see a man

26:45.563 --> 26:47.297
Deduction tank

26:48.081 --> 26:49.796
This man was not hit - is
ridiculous, just look at this

26:51.720 --> 26:53.347
How could it be otherwise?

26:53.763 --> 26:56.129
How to tank? Surrounded by trees

26:57.535 --> 26:59.629
I think - fell from the sky

27:16.386 --> 27:18.587
Only a few steps to climb, no?

27:20.845 --> 27:22.682
Lieutenant, what does?

27:22.717 --> 27:25.087
He snubbed, teacher

27:25.122 --> 27:27.194
I will teach a lesson
- May

27:27.695 --> 27:30.741
I said leave
as a lack of respect for me?

27:33.009 --> 27:34.988
He commented on his

27:36.029 --> 27:37.865
Good?
- About You

27:38.713 --> 27:40.825
I see Well I feel happy

27:40.860 --> 27:43.013
Followed by a handsome

27:43.505 --> 27:45.957
Professor?
- Follow your way, Lieutenant

27:51.305 --> 27:55.162
Do you hide that?
Must be a reason

27:57.333 --> 27:59.247
That's my name, I carved

28:00.393 --> 28:01.913
Why?

28:03.377 --> 28:05.870
She laugh
- Do not tell me

28:08.969 --> 28:10.875
I thought if I had a bullet with my name

28:12.209 --> 28:13.904
There will be no one

28:14.420 --> 28:16.521
That's devious

28:17.823 --> 28:19.918
You could make one for me?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.131
Faulks Lang

30:32.852 --> 30:34.787
What are you scared?

30:36.859 --> 30:38.608
Voices

30:39.053 --> 30:40.833
You need to run

30:41.228 --> 30:43.229
From Forest

30:55.062 --> 30:57.246
NO

30:57.281 --> 30:59.200
Dies

31:33.532 --> 31:36.383
God - how could he have been hurt

31:36.418 --> 31:39.631
I without damaging the sleeve?
- Is it a sign that the forest

31:39.666 --> 31:42.208
Bad - I'm sorry about your man

31:43.377 --> 31:45.919
The man would be alive if not
for you and this crazy mission

31:47.056 --> 31:48.624
I want to know what we do

31:49.741 --> 31:51.670
You should do this job

31:51.705 --> 31:53.430
Why?
To Please Your Boss?

31:54.583 --> 31:56.676
How many people must die to please the sick

31:58.113 --> 32:01.342
Please do not bother to shoot

32:03.679 --> 32:05.879
What the Russians feared?
Tell me!

32:06.521 --> 32:08.382
I do not know, not really

32:20.218 --> 32:22.352
Remember what I told you, that shit

32:27.883 --> 32:30.158
NO, not

32:39.555 --> 32:42.610
I think you can forget
orders, Mayor, please

32:43.616 --> 32:45.681
Fired

32:49.107 --> 32:51.231
Continue?

33:05.246 --> 33:07.861
We need to rest in order to continue

33:08.353 --> 33:10.603
Yes, sir

33:17.425 --> 33:19.164
Do you believe in the soul?

33:19.199 --> 33:20.974
Yes

33:22.089 --> 33:24.340
If you die, do you think we will have to deal with these

33:24.375 --> 33:26.341
We killed?

33:28.278 --> 33:30.369
It depends on the Lord

33:30.875 --> 33:33.870
Think, it will be bad and you pay

33:35.266 --> 33:37.666
'D will be dead not to kill again

33:38.215 --> 33:40.363
So do not worry

33:40.398 --> 33:42.889
I have this dream where I die surrounded

33:43.479 --> 33:45.232
All souls who took

33:46.148 --> 33:48.128
Trapping, suffocating

33:48.163 --> 33:49.986
Do you think it is hell?
- No?

33:50.691 --> 33:52.634
It're here

33:53.470 --> 33:55.663
If you died here, 'd
go to a better place

33:57.611 --> 33:59.350
Be angry with the person who killed you?

34:00.916 --> 34:02.717
If someone kill me clean and honest

34:02.752 --> 34:04.797
Man to man, this is war

34:05.450 --> 34:07.212
I'd like to shake his hand and

34:08.143 --> 34:10.007
What if it was not fair

34:10.737 --> 34:12.164
If you thought it was unfair that you want

34:12.199 --> 34:14.915
Balance adjustment - we must continue

34:19.502 --> 34:22.300
We will be in goal for tomorrow

34:26.125 --> 34:28.626
We have to wait

34:29.914 --> 34:32.091
And they?
- I know

34:32.748 --> 34:34.100
She is full of surprises

34:35.152 --> 34:37.264
It seems

34:57.700 --> 34:59.872
Do you know him?

35:00.665 --> 35:02.462
Safe?

35:02.990 --> 35:05.353
Recognized, why the attack?
- NOT

35:08.451 --> 35:10.848
What is the order, sir?

35:11.245 --> 35:12.660
What are you doing here?

35:13.041 --> 35:15.806
Release, again have
to be returned!

35:16.750 --> 35:18.541
Why attacked this woman?

35:18.967 --> 35:21.333
I received a direct order a senior officer

35:21.910 --> 35:24.115
It is a colonel of the SS as a common criminal

35:25.200 --> 35:26.994
Where are you from?
- Drop it

35:38.525 --> 35:40.445
Make sure Major

35:51.339 --> 35:53.168
Orders

35:53.613 --> 35:55.362
Come with me

35:59.107 --> 36:00.520
It has the same orders I

36:00.555 --> 36:02.609
Only he escort Professor Dietrich

36:03.097 --> 36:04.944
Dietrich Secret BD

36:05.670 --> 36:07.480
It sounds?
- Not

36:07.925 --> 36:10.464
Professor Dietrich Anananerp

36:12.067 --> 36:14.106
I'm going to guess. Man crushed by container

36:14.141 --> 36:16.304
Do you attacked and Colonel led the mission, because

36:16.339 --> 36:17.854
Damn, how I

36:18.994 --> 36:20.658
The first mission failed
so I thought, who cares

36:20.693 --> 36:22.379
We send more people to grinding

36:23.026 --> 36:24.993
Not so

36:25.626 --> 36:27.897
Sometimes, one is forced to do things you can not control

36:29.468 --> 36:31.175
I never wanted this, then drag

36:32.397 --> 36:33.950
But he had no choice

36:34.601 --> 36:36.221
You should do what you want

36:36.726 --> 36:38.539
If not, then

36:43.140 --> 36:45.540
Yes, I met with
Colonel 3 weeks ago

36:47.482 --> 36:49.201
But my superiors

36:49.854 --> 36:51.955
My friend Burm

36:52.783 --> 36:54.498
Professor

36:57.235 --> 36:59.366
Knew forest by the Russians

37:00.320 --> 37:03.843
So he went to Ackerman
and a group of SS

37:07.347 --> 37:09.054
What do you seek?
- It sounds crazy

37:09.089 --> 37:10.738
Email

37:12.536 --> 37:15.212
Secret studying the existence of protoarios

37:16.270 --> 37:18.969
Pure breed aalemanas
alleged evolved

37:20.683 --> 37:23.116
In the end he lost the perception of reality

37:24.172 --> 37:26.231
And his theories became more incredible

37:26.625 --> 37:28.243
What theories?

37:28.652 --> 37:30.803
The German people are descendants of the Aryan warriors

37:32.291 --> 37:34.216
Warriors?

37:34.778 --> 37:37.108
Super people, with huge opportunities

37:38.016 --> 37:40.798
Course it was crazy not believe

37:42.927 --> 37:45.676
Your goal is to
recreate a new species

37:46.545 --> 37:51.229
How?
- Raising those who are

37:51.264 --> 37:53.281
Pure Aryan

37:53.316 --> 37:54.838
For over a hundred years

37:54.873 --> 37:56.914
In the end, we become

37:57.309 --> 37:59.657
See, he came to the conclusion that they were warriors

37:59.692 --> 38:01.566
It was possible to communicate with them

38:01.601 --> 38:03.891
And you believe it?

38:04.389 --> 38:05.958
God

38:06.389 --> 38:08.164
I have no choice
What will you do?

38:10.425 --> 38:12.851
What were the orders
Ackerman I want to know

38:14.283 --> 38:16.244
Returning soldier ready

38:17.958 --> 38:20.439
Lord, you mean?
Not reached the destination

38:21.176 --> 38:23.246
Not completed the mission

38:24.741 --> 38:27.297
Professor Why come back?

38:27.703 --> 38:29.885
No sooner - Watch us

38:42.080 --> 38:44.169
I warned you

38:46.059 --> 38:48.276
I'll kill you for this

38:49.576 --> 38:52.241
I heard SS loses skills, right?

38:53.931 --> 38:56.375
Tell me die now, or not?

38:58.022 --> 39:00.350
If we go back now, without completing the mission

39:00.385 --> 39:02.249
Himmler to kill us all

39:02.670 --> 39:04.221
There is no mercy

39:04.256 --> 39:06.526
You and your men, Major Metzker I

39:06.561 --> 39:08.311
Everything dies

39:09.573 --> 39:11.593
Can not just reach

39:11.628 --> 39:13.387
But the only way to keep their people alive

39:13.422 --> 39:15.832
It is to reach those coordinates

39:16.262 --> 39:18.808
I do not know you, but I want

39:18.843 --> 39:20.869
A lot see the end of war

39:36.455 --> 39:39.307
You think about all this?
- I do not know what to believe

39:40.048 --> 39:42.686
But if this is true, whether it
be there and we can communicate

39:42.721 --> 39:44.754
With it, you want to be there
to start the conversation?

39:45.868 --> 39:47.737
Let's get something straight

39:48.208 --> 39:49.813
No matter what anyone says

39:49.848 --> 39:51.681
Third Reich is over

39:51.716 --> 39:54.339
We'll be lucky to live
if the Russians finish us

39:55.271 --> 39:58.102
You know something? It's good in a way

39:58.558 --> 40:01.082
You know, that would be bad?
What Germany win its war

40:01.117 --> 40:03.360
He won, and people like him

40:03.395 --> 40:05.462
It would be really intolerable

40:05.935 --> 40:08.485
What we need to do is finish the job

40:08.520 --> 40:10.207
Leave this forest

40:27.845 --> 40:30.158
It seems, on the trees

41:03.134 --> 41:04.917
Senior Care

41:05.282 --> 41:07.422
Look at the chest

41:16.478 --> 41:18.489
She's been dead a week

41:19.702 --> 41:21.627
There is no sense

41:42.312 --> 41:44.475
I know who killed Karl, but

41:46.777 --> 41:48.776
Is not the time to mourn

41:49.746 --> 41:51.412
One minute he was there and the other

41:51.789 --> 41:54.083
Gone - That was a week ago

41:54.496 --> 41:55.960
You could not do anything, he
was your friend - NOT a teacher

41:56.988 --> 41:58.954
I do not understand

41:59.680 --> 42:01.719
She burned before his eyes

42:03.949 --> 42:05.968
Only burned

42:07.504 --> 42:09.333
You believe me, right?

42:09.888 --> 42:12.788
Others believe that it was
the air in my head, but

42:12.823 --> 42:14.801
Know what I saw - Clear

42:22.160 --> 42:24.209
Come on, get out

42:30.760 --> 42:32.590
I never said

42:32.625 --> 42:35.303
I feel it all

42:36.374 --> 42:39.207
What did you tell them?
You know, the dead

42:44.236 --> 42:46.242
I can say that death is a rebirth

42:47.921 --> 42:50.121
Iran Better Place

42:51.946 --> 42:54.081
A on release

42:56.024 --> 42:59.128
And you believe that?
- Clear

43:01.329 --> 43:03.266
I used to believe in paradise

43:05.377 --> 43:07.481
Now, I'm not sure

43:13.565 --> 43:16.233
Let me die
When the signal

43:16.268 --> 43:18.290
What?
- Sign to know

43:18.325 --> 43:20.842
Everything is as you say
- What tone?

43:21.727 --> 43:23.498
I do not know anything

43:23.533 --> 43:25.254
It just let me

43:26.287 --> 43:28.396
Sergeant, who for what?

43:29.133 --> 43:31.758
If you say is true, I can live with that

43:32.653 --> 43:34.244
Ok?

43:35.010 --> 43:36.972
I'll leave it

43:40.432 --> 43:42.434
What makes you think that before his death?

44:12.108 --> 44:14.440
You have changed

44:15.087 --> 44:16.968
I do not remember you well

44:18.004 --> 44:20.043
Five years is a long time

44:21.361 --> 44:25.336
It's nice to walk with you

44:25.749 --> 44:28.141
You are not my friend

44:29.101 --> 44:31.888
This is a conversation we should have long ago

44:32.849 --> 44:35.601
Really?
I remember complaining about very

44:37.863 --> 44:41.059
As I recall, I wanted me
very much when I took to bed

44:41.657 --> 44:44.676
It was not, I was just tired of my day

44:50.353 --> 44:52.756
I have not changed what I feel

45:11.868 --> 45:14.366
No one said you're cute?

45:16.342 --> 45:18.754
Yes, at first

45:20.048 --> 45:21.398
No longer

45:23.174 --> 45:25.853
So there was a time
when they were free

45:27.889 --> 45:30.316
I was ready when I arrived

45:31.251 --> 45:34.593
It sounds so exciting

45:35.048 --> 45:36.794
Is not

45:44.141 --> 45:46.666
They said you were a traitor in the newspaper

45:47.327 --> 45:49.399
That was against the Fuhrer

45:50.287 --> 45:52.238
He was impressed

45:54.657 --> 45:56.882
It officially become a war hero

45:59.052 --> 46:01.291
Well, they give the same treatment heroes

46:01.326 --> 46:03.537
Civilians

46:05.299 --> 46:07.284
Just a little light

46:14.207 --> 46:16.387
Sergeant - There's something

46:18.238 --> 46:20.248
Do not - What?

46:22.094 --> 46:23.857
What?

46:27.296 --> 46:29.500
Where are they?
- Everywhere mayor

46:30.080 --> 46:31.913
I can not hear them, you can hear them

46:33.545 --> 46:35.410
Sergeant much

46:46.428 --> 46:48.600
Sergeant much

47:18.863 --> 47:20.528
Is Russian

47:22.182 --> 47:23.860
No one saw the fire

47:23.895 --> 47:25.778
Not one shot need not worry more

47:25.813 --> 47:27.898
For Russians - What did you hear, Sergeant?

47:28.643 --> 47:30.617
Were first gasps, then screams

47:31.189 --> 47:34.240
You have not heard anything?
- Are they talking about?

47:34.275 --> 47:36.420
It was not a language that you have heard

47:36.518 --> 47:38.567
We have to get out of this forest

47:38.602 --> 47:40.908
I say that we need to complete this mission

47:40.943 --> 47:43.717
Not more?
- We have it here

47:43.752 --> 47:45.671
We went fast and

47:48.798 --> 47:50.350
Ok, let

48:04.938 --> 48:06.520
Last scared

48:07.368 --> 48:09.210
I thought that surrounds us

48:10.227 --> 48:11.815
Is this forest

48:15.510 --> 48:17.458
Just leave the forest

48:21.509 --> 48:24.343
On the other hand, the other wants to delve into the forest

48:24.378 --> 48:26.131
How the land for sowing

48:26.615 --> 48:28.669
Do you think makes it so strange?

48:29.149 --> 48:31.060
You can not kill what is not there

48:32.871 --> 48:35.484
Do you think he's dead?
- Of course, what else would they be?

48:36.692 --> 48:38.123
Spirits

48:39.779 --> 48:42.309
I said earlier, this forest is owned

48:43.680 --> 48:45.830
We will kill all

48:46.246 --> 48:48.081
It can not be true

48:48.116 --> 48:49.860
Not? Dress Ackerman

48:49.895 --> 48:51.429
He was obsessed

48:51.464 --> 48:53.352
So he killed the teacher
possessed by an evil spirit

48:55.286 --> 48:57.608
This is crazy - Use your brain

49:01.990 --> 49:02.952
Sargent

49:05.733 --> 49:07.933
Sargent

49:33.086 --> 49:34.842
NO

49:46.609 --> 49:48.921
Alive

50:23.282 --> 50:25.661
Alive

51:12.967 --> 51:15.414
Sargent

51:15.904 --> 51:17.970
God

51:59.424 --> 52:01.535
Youngs - it is not possible

52:02.248 --> 52:04.301
But it is his dagger

52:16.819 --> 52:19.900
Veneer Youngs - maybe someone took

52:19.935 --> 52:21.995
Young body

52:23.208 --> 52:25.521
He used the knife to kill him and planted a disc

52:26.833 --> 52:29.051
Why would anyone do that?
- Very good lieutenant

52:30.957 --> 52:32.755
You were point

52:33.376 --> 52:36.456
It would be a great pleasure to kill Sergeant

52:38.812 --> 52:42.049
In fact, he was going to come back hanging

52:42.547 --> 52:45.803
But here, I must say that there is no need for any

52:45.838 --> 52:48.461
The man left, not right?

52:49.362 --> 52:51.302
Major?

52:51.809 --> 52:54.997
Bottom knife, it's not worth

52:57.056 --> 52:59.505
Main sergeant has reason

53:00.069 --> 53:01.783
This forest

53:01.818 --> 53:03.423
Possessed

53:03.458 --> 53:05.364
Spirits, passed before my eyes

53:05.399 --> 53:07.317
Something happened with a woman sniper

53:08.484 --> 53:10.703
I became a sergeant

53:13.052 --> 53:15.240
Saw ashes

53:15.275 --> 53:16.830
Listen, all

53:18.041 --> 53:20.420
I do not think that man becomes ash

53:20.455 --> 53:22.265
Mysteriously appears

53:22.958 --> 53:25.175
I do not think that the forest can be possessed

53:25.210 --> 53:28.293
I do not think that this
forest has ghosts, demons

53:29.783 --> 53:31.772
Or cursed goblins

53:33.170 --> 53:35.093
So let's get this

53:35.128 --> 53:37.016
The sergeant was killed by a man

53:38.044 --> 53:40.417
Let's get the hell supernatural heads

53:41.387 --> 53:43.490
We have a mission

53:44.071 --> 53:45.968
And the sooner you complete the mission

53:46.003 --> 53:47.733
Faster return to our lives

53:48.697 --> 53:50.612
So act quickly and collectively

53:51.198 --> 53:53.740
I do not want anyone
understand that?

53:57.434 --> 54:00.281
You ignore the logical solution to this murder

54:01.031 --> 54:03.051
What is it?

54:03.086 --> 54:07.109
Soldier killed Sergeant Baum

54:07.144 --> 54:08.792
That was the last to see him alive

54:09.412 --> 54:11.151
It was the last in Riviera

54:11.186 --> 54:13.108
He could have taken the dagger

54:13.143 --> 54:15.464
What we hear is clearly psychotic

54:16.440 --> 54:18.390
Are you crazy
Why kill him?

54:19.177 --> 54:21.269
This is the advantage of being psychotic

54:22.366 --> 54:24.690
You do not need an excuse

54:25.153 --> 54:27.429
Baum was a soldier in this war for so long

54:27.464 --> 54:29.603
I do not remember what it was before

54:29.638 --> 54:31.357
That's all she knows

54:31.392 --> 54:33.391
He lived with us, fought with us

54:33.426 --> 54:35.243
I cried with us

54:35.278 --> 54:37.080
We are a family

54:37.115 --> 54:39.067
Rather than kill
which of us

54:39.984 --> 54:41.909
Is that clear?

54:43.130 --> 54:44.669
Yes

54:45.245 --> 54:47.511
Is your man Higher - Yes, it is

54:49.085 --> 54:51.839
At the head of the Major

54:53.545 --> 54:55.597
Soldier with Professor

55:01.748 --> 55:03.751
Watch them both

55:05.970 --> 55:07.852
DO NOT believe what you say

55:08.532 --> 55:10.713
Logically is the obvious culprit

55:11.556 --> 55:13.446
Metzker is right

55:15.774 --> 55:17.959
Would not be the first person
in the war raging

55:20.514 --> 55:22.566
But he?

55:24.608 --> 55:26.916
Part of me believes in Metzker

55:27.755 --> 55:29.521
Mr.

55:30.367 --> 55:32.631
Because I do not like alternative

55:39.264 --> 55:41.840
Do not worry, no one believes Metzker

55:42.361 --> 55:44.670
I just wish he was not a suspect

55:45.215 --> 55:48.175
There is no enmity between the two

55:48.210 --> 55:50.585
Professor - What, what happened?

55:52.819 --> 55:54.774
Four months ago, the Russians tried to attack Bosoi

55:55.530 --> 55:57.871
Killing all

56:00.466 --> 56:03.140
Discovered Metzker
children hanging tree

56:05.430 --> 56:08.766
So the mayor clearly has not stopped

56:09.967 --> 56:12.425
So I ended up the biggest

56:14.226 --> 56:16.139
Good, it ended badly

56:16.810 --> 56:18.918
SS accused him of treason

56:18.953 --> 56:21.275
And two weeks later, Major
again, without explanation

56:22.827 --> 56:26.207
Soldier thought someone
spoke well of him

56:28.152 --> 56:30.247
You can always find more information

56:30.765 --> 56:32.439
Why was he fired?

56:32.990 --> 56:35.272
You can not say, probably helped somebody

56:36.092 --> 56:37.986
Himmler itself depended on

56:38.021 --> 56:39.973
You know?

56:57.239 --> 56:59.421
Soldier Overview

57:20.045 --> 57:22.064
Who are you?

57:25.967 --> 57:29.242
Where did you get that uniform, you bastard?

57:31.113 --> 57:33.534
Is insulting the SS uniform

57:34.443 --> 57:37.366
It is a death penalty
- do not touch it

57:42.634 --> 57:46.265
This man is not capable of dressing up

57:46.300 --> 57:48.339
It is very delicate
- Someone dressed him

57:48.829 --> 57:50.952
Why put a label?

57:55.553 --> 57:57.880
Remember woman?

57:59.517 --> 58:01.113
Yes

58:01.148 --> 58:02.895
I remember

58:03.372 --> 58:05.371
I warn you to keep your mouth shut

58:06.054 --> 58:07.933
Main thank him what

58:08.427 --> 58:10.248
Know that you do not question the Mayor

58:11.279 --> 58:13.642
I am at your disposal One
of them is that this las

58:14.500 --> 58:16.171
Why can not we get out of here

58:16.634 --> 58:18.274
Surely he realizes

58:18.756 --> 58:20.615
It is the soldier, are the order

58:21.112 --> 58:22.743
Completed the mission and all

58:48.995 --> 58:50.880
I have seen

58:52.127 --> 58:53.514
I have seen

59:23.011 --> 59:25.000
General Altman

59:25.035 --> 59:27.499
I see a couple of injuries, but they are healed

59:34.379 --> 59:36.587
Can a man

59:37.515 --> 59:39.111
Do the same scar

59:39.146 --> 59:41.025
It's been done

59:43.502 --> 59:45.583
Do younger in this picture

59:46.176 --> 59:48.057
Wore Unifom SS

59:52.725 --> 59:55.041
I had disgraced the uniform of the SS

59:56.106 --> 59:58.189
It was lawful pursuit - Age SS

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.930
You can not be

01:00:03.965 --> 01:00:05.613
It's a different man

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:07.964
After sending
arrested for murder

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:10.458
And what would you say?

01:00:13.078 --> 01:00:14.995
Will you take the
body back with us?

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:18.345
Lieutenant, simply remove weapons Mayor Metzker

01:00:19.356 --> 01:00:21.405
'Re in custody - I do not think so

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:27.916
I had a clear shot

01:00:28.481 --> 01:00:30.274
Continued Mar. 5 minutes

01:00:30.838 --> 01:00:32.658
Prepare largest
- Yes, sir

01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:38.152
Well, Walt

01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:41.961
Secret wanted to believe there was something in the forest

01:00:43.028 --> 01:00:44.697
The coordinates

01:00:45.222 --> 01:00:47.272
Something significant - What?

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.990
Unit

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.642
That's it? My people are killed by a piece

01:00:56.677 --> 01:00:58.373
Basuro who you want
to put in a museum?

01:00:59.202 --> 01:01:02.115
I know that this mission is absurd, but I threw

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.400
On how you

01:01:05.322 --> 01:01:07.500
You think I'm happy to be here?

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:09.536
God Ana

01:01:12.307 --> 01:01:14.312
I'm trying to make my meeting troops

01:01:14.864 --> 01:01:16.729
Keep
my people live - What we do

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:19.809
What gives them the right to manipulate us?

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:24.340
Puppeteers dance about hell

01:01:25.425 --> 01:01:27.196
When you laugh in our face

01:01:28.074 --> 01:01:30.303
What we can do is to find the relic

01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:33.249
We have to find and return

01:01:34.277 --> 01:01:35.777
'S our only chance

01:01:39.705 --> 01:01:41.781
I have a feeling that someone or something

01:01:42.952 --> 01:01:44.710
Do you want to find us

01:02:03.882 --> 01:02:05.685
Fletcher

01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:14.047
Where are you?

01:02:15.864 --> 01:02:17.363
Professor?

01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:41.196
OK, let

01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:44.096
Keep tightly

01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:45.781
Yes, sir

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:04.944
What is the road?

01:03:04.979 --> 01:03:06.553
They are not interested

01:03:06.588 --> 01:03:08.875
Please tell me

01:03:09.488 --> 01:03:11.306
Just walk

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:14.474
There is something to do with urgency?

01:03:16.255 --> 01:03:18.683
The Prime Minister said that
the same aircraft engines

01:03:22.897 --> 01:03:25.553
Should be to manipulate people

01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:32.125
Les whispered your wife
and son before his death?

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.518
NO

01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:38.643
Sure

01:03:38.678 --> 01:03:41.079
They killed, but they were not with them

01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:45.472
Grozny

01:03:45.507 --> 01:03:47.437
Not being able to stay at home to protect

01:03:47.472 --> 01:03:48.996
Family

01:03:49.031 --> 01:03:51.045
How do I know?
- I know all about you

01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:55.180
It's my job to know

01:03:55.215 --> 01:03:57.344
I know that my grandmother was a whore Indian

01:03:57.379 --> 01:04:01.402
And for some reason decided to take it as a trophy

01:04:02.284 --> 01:04:04.205
It comes with a rival

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:07.616
Derived from inferior

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:13.713
When you end the war disappear from the surface

01:04:13.748 --> 01:04:16.179
Earth

01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:20.500
I'm an officer of the SS

01:04:21.652 --> 01:04:23.455
Do not kill me

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:27.003
You are shit

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.415
NO

01:06:13.747 --> 01:06:16.786
Each pink, romance

01:06:32.661 --> 01:06:34.322
What happened, Metzker?

01:06:41.576 --> 01:06:43.623
Shoot, if the moves

01:06:45.546 --> 01:06:47.286
Let

01:06:50.194 --> 01:06:52.126
Do you know what happened, right?

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:56.758
Do you just too afraid to say

01:06:59.054 --> 01:07:02.183
If he was Metzker, why do not you run?

01:07:08.668 --> 01:07:10.164
Do you think?

01:07:11.854 --> 01:07:13.665
We get rid of it

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.837
And then what?

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:18.889
Why is this place?

01:07:20.027 --> 01:07:21.885
I think this look

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.120
What is it?

01:07:32.903 --> 01:07:34.829
One thing that is used to communicate with the warriors

01:07:37.188 --> 01:07:39.337
Where did you get it?
- Dietrich

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.726
Think there?
Warriors

01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:48.514
What does this for us

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.338
This is not a man - I do not understand Mayor

01:07:53.456 --> 01:07:57.067
What happens, it was not made by man

01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:03.981
We found it, buried it for anyone to find

01:08:05.629 --> 01:08:07.255
But how do we know that it exists?

01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:12.229
Dietrich left location
- Its coordinates

01:08:12.264 --> 01:08:15.507
- This Desvario,

01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:19.283
Crazy

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:30.171
Only burned and I could not help

01:08:31.256 --> 01:08:33.115
NO could help

01:10:23.798 --> 01:10:25.496
What is a whore?

01:10:33.517 --> 01:10:35.447
What is whore?

01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:37.897
Dieter Baum you?

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.525
'Re a good gunner

01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:01.333
But she also

01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:06.344
Alive

01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:11.250
It is a good weapon, I will kill her German

01:12:46.332 --> 01:12:48.475
Admit Mayor, it is overwhelmed

01:12:49.511 --> 01:12:51.739
In everything that happens around

01:12:52.748 --> 01:12:55.363
And I'll tell you a secret?

01:12:56.261 --> 01:12:58.066
Will die

01:12:58.724 --> 01:13:00.737
Do you know why?

01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:03.668
Because for us, the race
developed, they are all weak

01:13:03.703 --> 01:13:05.721
Will be taken by the forest

01:13:14.769 --> 01:13:16.828
Ter, cholera, not

01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:25.315
He was shot in the leg

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.167
It has several fractures

01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:32.369
He fell

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.625
God

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.820
Come quickly

01:14:06.878 --> 01:14:08.369
Herring, a teacher

01:14:15.224 --> 01:14:17.168
Forest has a sense of mood

01:14:24.496 --> 01:14:27.111
It is a coincidence?
How do we die?

01:14:27.516 --> 01:14:29.388
How do you feel?
- Well

01:14:31.178 --> 01:14:32.920
So what ?!
- So you know your intentions

01:14:33.871 --> 01:14:36.475
Can be buried in this thing

01:14:37.002 --> 01:14:38.530
At least we do not want to take her with us

01:14:39.006 --> 01:14:41.363
This is a good opportunity
- but is it worth it?

01:14:41.823 --> 01:14:43.527
Thought can only play us

01:14:44.658 --> 01:14:46.046
For fun

01:14:46.714 --> 01:14:48.160
Bring Major

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.888
Let's go fucking crazy

01:15:17.496 --> 01:15:19.824
Mayor

01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:32.874
Where are you?

01:15:43.227 --> 01:15:44.768
Shit

01:16:00.961 --> 01:16:02.852
Why are you here?
- Wait

01:16:02.887 --> 01:16:05.367
I am a German soldier
- a deserter, spy

01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:08.420
No, this is Lieutenant
Eric Stultz Unit 209

01:16:09.704 --> 01:16:11.769
Serial Number 246789

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.021
Colonel Ackerman - you know me?

01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:23.324
You listen, you must have your men

01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:25.210
Immediately and leave the forest

01:16:25.245 --> 01:16:27.126
It is in great danger - What else do we know, Lieutenant?

01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:30.873
Stay mission, I know, Professor Dietrich

01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:33.801
I know why you're here
I have the same mission

01:16:33.836 --> 01:16:35.899
Why send the same mission

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.392
Where is Professor Dietrich realized

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.354
Professor Dietrich is no longer part of the operation

01:16:41.487 --> 01:16:43.169
Disappeared

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.201
'Re too informed by Lieutenant

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.301
You killed him?
- If listen, colonel

01:16:50.687 --> 01:16:53.231
Do not touch the relic kill

01:16:56.806 --> 01:16:58.687
You should try to get out of
the forest as soon as possible

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.670
How many of you - all dead

01:17:03.732 --> 01:17:05.964
This mission was treated with the utmost discretion

01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:09.167
Only Professor Dietrich was aware of the

01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:12.340
How do you know so much?

01:17:13.293 --> 01:17:15.323
Our orders were the same

01:17:15.816 --> 01:17:17.734
When I returned we
were sent to the same

01:17:17.769 --> 01:17:20.169
We have only two
days, did not go

01:17:20.204 --> 01:17:22.135
You're a spy - Not

01:17:22.587 --> 01:17:25.960
Look, we brought scientist, Professor Kaplan
