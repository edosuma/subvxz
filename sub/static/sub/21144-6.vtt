00:01.360 --> 00:02.951
Hey, guys! I'm Paige!

00:02.987 --> 00:05.236
I'm Frankie,
and we're Bizaardvark.

00:05.272 --> 00:08.181
- Remember when you were a baby?
- The answer is no,

00:08.216 --> 00:10.803
because the human brain does not
make memories until you're three.

00:10.827 --> 00:12.894
I think my first memory
was when I was in preschool.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.658
- Me, too.
- Yeah, I think I was taking a nap,

00:14.682 --> 00:16.297
and I had this awesome
purple pillow

00:16.333 --> 00:18.333
that I absolutely loved.

00:18.368 --> 00:21.670
I remember a milestone for me was
making my first best friend.

00:21.705 --> 00:23.238
- Yeah.
- Aww.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.457
It wasn't you. I didn't know her.
Back then.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.542
Didn't know you back then.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.319
- Still hurts, though.
- Okay. Well...

00:29.354 --> 00:32.914
Here's our latest video,
"The Worst Lullaby Ever."

00:32.950 --> 00:35.567
- Mommy...
- Time for bed, little baby.

00:35.602 --> 00:40.355
(baby noises)

00:40.390 --> 00:43.826
I've never sung a lullaby before,
so I hope this goes well.

Hey, Sierra High!

03:39.303 --> 03:42.329
I seem to have lost my watch.
What time is it?

03:42.364 --> 03:43.746
Students: Pep rally time!

03:43.781 --> 03:45.298
Whooo!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.251
I was gonna say "too early
for this."

03:50.723 --> 03:52.055
Amen, sister.

03:54.409 --> 03:56.810
Now let's amp up
that school spirit

03:56.845 --> 04:00.488
by bringing out
the Sierra High Hawwwwk!

04:00.523 --> 04:01.773
(cheering and applause)

04:01.808 --> 04:03.700
(owl hooting)

04:03.735 --> 04:05.343
Hey, isn't that an owl?

04:05.378 --> 04:06.536
I don't know, let me check.

04:06.571 --> 04:08.488
Hey! Isn't that an owl?

04:10.501 --> 04:14.636
- Yes, technically.
- Yes, technically.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.640
We came up with the mascot
before we knew how tough it was

04:16.664 --> 04:19.140
to actually get a hawk.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.733
But, we named this owl "Hawk."

04:20.769 --> 04:21.984
So it still works.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.962
Go Hawks!

04:23.997 --> 04:26.606
Hawk! Go Hawk!

04:26.641 --> 04:27.641
Saved it!

04:29.511 --> 04:30.902
Do the wave!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.680
(cheering)

04:37.419 --> 04:39.511
I don't like how Hawk's
in a cage.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.012
I don't like where
this is going.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.700
You know, I've always
passionately believed...

04:42.724 --> 04:44.491
Paige/Frankie: Whoaaah!

04:44.526 --> 04:47.686
That animals deserve to be free.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.538
- We are not okay with this?
- No.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.698
- Right?
- No, no, no, don't rope me into this.

04:51.734 --> 04:54.359
- I...
- Paige/Frankie: Whooooa!

04:54.395 --> 04:58.063
I'm completely fine with it.
That owl has a great life.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.081
People cheer for it
just for existing.

05:00.117 --> 05:03.769
I agree...
we need to do something.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.687
All-school flash mob!

05:05.722 --> 05:07.421
(cheering)

05:07.457 --> 05:09.949
Again, there is no "we."

05:09.984 --> 05:11.020
And whatever plan
you're hatching,

05:11.044 --> 05:13.036
I'm sure it's...

05:13.071 --> 05:15.055
Paige/Frankie:
Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw!

05:15.090 --> 05:17.290
Totally dumb!

05:17.325 --> 05:18.725
Paige/Frankie:
Caw! Caw! Caw! Caw!

05:23.240 --> 05:26.883
Get excited, Ameliacs,
because Alisha Marie and I

05:26.918 --> 05:30.178
are workin' on the DIY
collab of the century!

05:30.213 --> 05:31.974
We don't wanna give away
too much, but I've got

05:31.998 --> 05:35.833
two words: Aloe, vera.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.479
I know your "Aloe Vera Cures Everything"
video has 20 million views,

05:39.514 --> 05:42.840
but... this project
doesn't involve aloe vera.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.876
But it could.

05:45.603 --> 05:46.969
Quick announcement, Dareheads.

05:47.005 --> 05:49.889
I'm takin' the week off from dares
to babysit my buddy's little brother

05:49.924 --> 05:52.183
while he's out of town.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.630
I'm gonna nurture this kid so hard,
by the time I'm done with him,

05:54.654 --> 05:56.721
he's gonna be
a delightful young man!

05:58.834 --> 06:00.141
I worship the ground
you walk on.

06:01.687 --> 06:03.178
What was that?

06:03.213 --> 06:05.105
I said, uh, it's time for lunch.

06:08.377 --> 06:11.077
Surprising life hack: A fun way
to add texture to any sandwich

06:11.112 --> 06:13.346
is by adding aloe vera.

06:13.381 --> 06:14.701
Okay, I find that
hard to believe.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.538
Oh, my gosh!
This is how I eat now!

06:25.269 --> 06:27.293
Where's DareMeBro?

06:27.329 --> 06:29.838
Hey, you must be Patrick.

06:29.873 --> 06:32.173
And I'm Bernie. I know we're
gonna get along great

06:32.208 --> 06:34.834
because kids, like
all people, love me.

06:34.869 --> 06:35.869
Uuuuh!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.596
Everybody hates me!

06:44.996 --> 06:47.230
Oh, noooo!

06:48.766 --> 06:52.368
Okay, so remember how you
said the owl looked sad?

06:52.404 --> 06:57.290
- Nooo...
- And remember how you said if we stand for nothing,

06:57.326 --> 06:59.776
we are nothing, so why not
stand up for animal rights?

06:59.811 --> 07:00.811
Nooo!

07:02.264 --> 07:04.205
It's Hawk the owl!

07:04.241 --> 07:06.408
I see that.
Why is it in my room?

07:06.443 --> 07:08.201
So we can liberate it together!

07:08.236 --> 07:09.135
Like we talked about, remember?

07:09.170 --> 07:10.970
First of all, there is no "we."

07:11.005 --> 07:11.913
What's second of all?

07:11.948 --> 07:12.948
There is no "we"!

07:14.877 --> 07:16.601
I... I don't want any part
of this,

07:16.678 --> 07:18.230
and I definitely don't want
that thing in my room.

07:18.254 --> 07:19.804
Thing?

07:19.839 --> 07:21.222
Him?

07:21.257 --> 07:22.999
Her?

07:23.035 --> 07:24.309
I'm not checkin'.

07:25.938 --> 07:27.729
Whoo! Yeah!

07:31.234 --> 07:33.609
Gotcha! Game's over, tough guy,

07:33.645 --> 07:36.412
you're not escapin' these claws.

07:36.447 --> 07:38.490
Aaah-haha, that was all bone!

07:40.210 --> 07:41.534
Ooh, lemme take a look at that.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.906
Dude, do you shave your legs?

07:46.941 --> 07:50.401
It's a... wrestling thing.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.878
(girls screaming)

07:54.808 --> 07:57.366
Don't move!

07:57.402 --> 08:01.913
We caught this little monster trying
to destroy the amazing DIY project

08:01.948 --> 08:04.132
that we've been working on
for over a month.

08:04.167 --> 08:07.761
It's a shower chandelier.

08:07.796 --> 08:11.397
It hangs over your shower and can dispense
shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

08:13.401 --> 08:15.393
Elegant and practical.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.079
Nice!

08:18.114 --> 08:20.181
You can also
put aloe vera in it.

08:20.217 --> 08:21.491
What is your deal?

08:23.219 --> 08:25.411
Must break! Must break!

08:27.424 --> 08:28.973
We have to post this video
by tomorrow,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.078
and without
that shower chandelier,

08:30.102 --> 08:32.494
we've got nothing.

08:32.529 --> 08:35.505
If he breaks it,
we break you guys!

08:35.540 --> 08:38.592
Hot. I mean...

08:38.627 --> 08:39.717
No, that's hot.

08:45.509 --> 08:48.359
Lemme go, I have to break stuff!

08:48.394 --> 08:49.769
How are you so strong?

08:52.057 --> 08:53.740
That's it!
I'm callin' your brother

08:53.775 --> 08:55.015
to come back and take you home.

08:56.694 --> 08:57.819
I can't let you do that.

09:00.365 --> 09:04.993
All right. It's time I
share some intel with you.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.912
And I'm only telling you this because
you look like two smart guys.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.448
- That is true.
- I wasn't paying attention.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.567
I'm not
a regular eight-year-old.

09:12.602 --> 09:14.485
I'm an undercover agent
in the CIA.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.687
That's ridiculous!

09:16.723 --> 09:18.317
You're a little kid
who likes to destroy stuff.

09:18.341 --> 09:19.591
That's just my cover.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.337
That shower chandelier
is a threat

09:24.372 --> 09:25.597
to our national security.

09:27.542 --> 09:28.542
What?

09:30.011 --> 09:31.945
Think about it.

09:32.022 --> 09:34.613
If our enemies got ahold
of something like that,

09:34.649 --> 09:36.827
they could use the soap dispensers
as condiment dispensers

09:36.851 --> 09:39.009
during wartime.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.021
While our soldiers are squeezing
little ketchup and mustard packets

09:42.056 --> 09:44.936
onto their hot dogs, our enemies are
done with lunch and ready to attack!

09:46.653 --> 09:49.045
What?

09:49.081 --> 09:52.298
So what do you say? Will you guys help
me destroy that shower chandelier

09:52.333 --> 09:54.892
and save your country?

09:54.928 --> 09:59.172
Patrick, would you give us
a minute?

09:59.207 --> 10:03.693
Okay, we've got an eight-year-old
telling us he's a CIA agent

10:03.729 --> 10:06.445
who needs our help
to destroy a shower chandelier

10:06.481 --> 10:08.956
for national security reasons.

10:08.992 --> 10:09.992
Do we believe him?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.431
- I absolutely do.
- Me, too.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.347
We will help you
defend our nation!

10:16.383 --> 10:19.567
Excellent! Now, will someone
take me to the bathroom?

10:19.602 --> 10:21.122
I'm not allowed
to go tinkle by myself.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.780
(sigh) Been there.

10:29.203 --> 10:32.397
(majestic music playing)

10:32.432 --> 10:34.524
All right,
you beautiful creature.

10:34.559 --> 10:36.709
The moment has come
to set you free.

10:38.221 --> 10:42.615
Soar! Explore! Live!

10:42.650 --> 10:44.867
- W... W... W... Wait! Paige, wait!
- (music turned off)

10:44.902 --> 10:46.782
What are you doin'?
The music was swellin', man!

10:50.191 --> 10:54.285
Birds living in captivity have a
hard time surviving in the wild.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.320
You can't free Hawk the owl because he
doesn't know how to fend for himself.

10:58.099 --> 10:59.099
Oh.

11:01.044 --> 11:04.379
Oh, no.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.294
I just wanna point out this is the one
time <i>I</i> didn't get us into trouble.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.462
This is awful! What do
we do with the owl?

11:12.497 --> 11:14.798
It's okay. Just be calm, okay?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.914
Obviously the first thing
we do is stop saying "we"!

11:25.168 --> 11:27.279
- You gotta take him back!
- Hey! Hawk's not a pair of cargo pants,

11:27.303 --> 11:29.896
I can't just return him.

11:29.973 --> 11:32.590
Ugh. Living in a cage forever
must be miserable.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.560
(gasp) You don't think returned
pants feel miserable, do you?

11:35.595 --> 11:38.504
No, that's dumb.

11:38.539 --> 11:40.223
Well, then what's your plan?

11:40.258 --> 11:43.818
I don't know,
this is my first owl.

11:43.853 --> 11:46.607
But I guess for now Hawk is our
responsibility, and he must be hungry.

11:46.631 --> 11:47.906
We have to feed him.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.040
(mice squeaking)

11:49.076 --> 11:50.283
He eats mice?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.154
Do you not know anything
about owls?

11:56.416 --> 12:00.793
What if we give him
the option of a nice kale salad?

12:00.828 --> 12:02.904
He could be a vegan
and not even realize it.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.938
Paige, there's no such thing
as a vegan owl.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.716
Hey! That's a micro aggression!

12:08.653 --> 12:10.686
I think.

12:10.722 --> 12:13.890
Whatever. Why don't we let Hawk
decide what he wants to eat?

12:18.596 --> 12:19.596
Hoo.

12:24.085 --> 12:26.125
Did the mice run away while
we were out of the room?

12:27.880 --> 12:30.281
Yes, Paige. That's
exactly what happened.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.542
(screams)

12:47.792 --> 12:49.425
I can't believe
someone dared you

12:49.460 --> 12:52.737
to give us a year's supply
of nail polish!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.889
You know, a fun substitute
for nail polish is aloe vera.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.350
Is someone sponsoring you?

12:59.537 --> 13:00.977
And how can I get in on it?
(giggles)

13:02.565 --> 13:05.858
Bad news, ladies.
There is no nail polish.

13:08.471 --> 13:10.855
What?

13:10.891 --> 13:14.792
You can't leave this room.
Patrick works for the CIA

13:14.827 --> 13:17.028
and must destroy
your shower chandelier

13:17.063 --> 13:18.830
as a matter
of national security.

13:21.275 --> 13:23.626
What?

13:23.662 --> 13:25.687
Bernie's not
explaining it right.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.796
It involves hot dogs.

13:28.399 --> 13:31.550
Did you ever think that the
little brat is just playing you

13:31.586 --> 13:32.906
because he likes
destroyin' stuff?

13:35.039 --> 13:37.198
The door's locked!
That kid locked us in here!

13:37.233 --> 13:38.991
You guys are idiots.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.094
Amelia, would you give us
a minute?

13:42.130 --> 13:46.382
Okay... Amelia is saying
that we're idiots.

13:46.418 --> 13:48.367
Do we believe her?

13:48.402 --> 13:49.735
- I absolutely do.
- Me, too.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.959
I've been wanting
to free Hawk the owl for years.

13:55.994 --> 14:00.363
But finally, some brave,
anonymous hero had the guts

14:00.398 --> 14:02.457
to step up
and do the right thing.

14:02.492 --> 14:04.175
It was Paige!

14:04.210 --> 14:06.878
(cheers and applause)

14:06.913 --> 14:10.506
All chanting: Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!
Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!

14:10.541 --> 14:12.391
Paige! Paige!

14:12.426 --> 14:13.801
Both: Paige! Paige!

14:13.836 --> 14:15.386
Paige, wake up!

14:17.849 --> 14:20.299
You were having a hero dream,
weren't you?

14:20.335 --> 14:22.455
- Yeah.
- You know it's not gonna be like that, right?

14:24.380 --> 14:25.563
Yeah.

14:31.462 --> 14:34.313
Hawk is out there somewhere.
We need to find him.

14:34.349 --> 14:36.640
You, search the gym.
You, search the cafeteria.

14:36.676 --> 14:40.853
You... You're fired.

14:40.889 --> 14:43.849
I know this is an awkward time to tell
you, but we both knew it was coming.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.704
Principal Karen?
You wanted to see us?

14:49.739 --> 14:52.181
Yes. Our majestic friend,

14:52.216 --> 14:54.133
Hawk the owl, has been stolen!

14:54.168 --> 14:55.593
(gasp)

14:55.628 --> 14:56.628
(gasp)

14:58.714 --> 15:00.142
I need you girls
to keep an ear to the ground

15:00.166 --> 15:01.766
in case you hear anything.

15:03.394 --> 15:04.827
What's with the phones?

15:04.863 --> 15:05.906
Well, I've set up
an owl hotline center,

15:05.930 --> 15:09.281
where anyone can call in
with tips on Hawk's whereabouts.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.442
(phone rings)

15:11.477 --> 15:13.168
Hawk hotline!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.604
Yes, my refrigerator's
running, why?

15:15.781 --> 15:17.406
Oh, ha, ha, very funny.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.578
Man, you are determined
to find out who took Hawk.

15:22.613 --> 15:26.498
Duh. It is a federal crime
to take an owl.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.752
Whoa! Federal crime!

15:31.464 --> 15:35.391
Wow-wow-wow!

15:35.427 --> 15:36.517
(phone rings)

15:36.553 --> 15:39.078
Hawk hotline!

15:39.113 --> 15:40.833
No, I don't care what kind
of bagel can fly!

15:42.725 --> 15:44.858
- (phone rings)
- Hawk hotline!

15:44.894 --> 15:47.453
A plain bagel?

15:47.489 --> 15:51.156
(chuckles)
Okay, that's actually not bad.

15:51.192 --> 15:54.293
Hawk is in danger. Only trained
individuals with a license

15:54.328 --> 15:55.877
can possess an owl.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.606
I am one of those individuals.

15:58.641 --> 15:59.774
That's pretty cool, right?

15:59.809 --> 16:02.618
Both: Uhhh...

16:02.653 --> 16:04.937
(phone buzzes)

16:04.972 --> 16:06.800
Ooh. Animal Control says Hawk
has a GPS tracker on him.

16:06.824 --> 16:10.201
I just have to download
this app to find his location.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.445
- We gotta go move Hawk.
- Totally.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.055
We gotta run, PK.
Good luck on your search.

16:15.090 --> 16:16.132
Check Bernie's locker!

16:24.025 --> 16:26.308
He's destroying your studio.

16:26.343 --> 16:29.586
Why hasn't he gone for the
shower chandelier yet?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.964
Because he's good.

16:31.999 --> 16:34.725
He's been one step ahead of us
from the get-go.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.828
He's playin' chess,
we're playin' checkers.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.471
I hid it in the lounge.

16:39.506 --> 16:40.740
Another interesting theory.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.418
He's in the lounge!

16:48.608 --> 16:51.384
Oh, no, no, no. How are
we gonna get outta here?

16:51.461 --> 16:54.703
Did someone say aloe vera?
Quick! Gimme a shoelace!

16:54.738 --> 16:58.841
I haven't learned how to tie my...
I mean, uh, I prefer Velcro.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.144
I got one!

17:02.180 --> 17:05.765
Now stand back and witness the
power of nature's miracle goo!

17:08.636 --> 17:11.763
If this doesn't work,
I've got the key.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.147
Always have a plan B, Bern Man.

17:21.758 --> 17:24.116
Where are we going?

17:24.151 --> 17:27.787
Aww... do you hear that, Hawk?
She said "we."

17:29.540 --> 17:33.150
We just gotta keep movin' before
Principal Karen tracks us.

17:33.185 --> 17:36.436
- (knocking on door)
- Girls? Are you in there?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.923
It's Principal Karen!
We need to talk!

17:47.775 --> 17:48.516
(knocking on window)

17:48.551 --> 17:50.125
Hello in there!

17:50.161 --> 17:51.752
Helloooo!

17:51.787 --> 17:53.154
It's not gonna
end like this, Hawk!

17:53.189 --> 17:54.749
It's probably gonna end
like this, Hawk!

18:00.488 --> 18:03.639
Okay, I'll take Hawk upstairs. Get
rid of her as fast as you can.

18:03.675 --> 18:05.682
(knocking on window)

18:05.718 --> 18:08.176
- Hellooo?
- Hi.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.112
Principal Karen!
What are you doing here?

18:10.148 --> 18:13.799
So, I'm waiting for the owl
tracking app to download,

18:13.834 --> 18:17.578
and then I'm like, duh, the best way to
find Hawk is to post a missing owl video

18:17.613 --> 18:19.405
up on our channel.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.123
- Our channel?
- Bizaardvark's channel.

18:21.158 --> 18:23.133
Oh, our channel.

18:23.169 --> 18:26.870
Yeah, that's what I said.

18:26.905 --> 18:30.199
Uh, w... well, you can't make a video
without Paige, who is definitely not here,

18:30.235 --> 18:31.711
- so...
- You're right, Paige is the funny one.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.535
Excuse me?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.821
In the meantime, I'll just
wait for this owl tracking app

18:35.856 --> 18:37.222
to finish downloading.

18:37.258 --> 18:39.742
What's your Wi-Fi password?
Is it "password"?

18:39.777 --> 18:41.602
- No!
- "Password 1"?

18:41.637 --> 18:42.637
Yeah.

18:44.448 --> 18:46.190
Great. It downloaded!
Victory selfie!

18:46.225 --> 18:48.058
(click)

18:48.093 --> 18:50.452
- (beeping)
- Oh! He's close!

18:50.487 --> 18:54.264
As a licensed owl handler,
I know how to call him...

18:54.300 --> 18:56.917
Hawk? Hawk, are you here?

18:58.487 --> 18:59.487
Hawk!

19:08.422 --> 19:09.555
Yeah, I got it!

19:12.226 --> 19:13.429
Unhand that chandelier,
you little brat!

19:13.453 --> 19:15.503
No, give it to me!

19:15.538 --> 19:16.882
- It's Amelia's, not yours!
- It's not yours, it's mine!

19:16.906 --> 19:17.906
Give it...

19:20.618 --> 19:22.793
I guess you don't love
your country anymore, huh?

19:22.829 --> 19:23.997
You're not fooling anyone, kid,
give it a rest.

19:24.021 --> 19:27.565
Don't listen to her, soldier.
Hand me that chandelier.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.892
No, give us the chandelier.

19:29.927 --> 19:32.619
It's a threat to our nation.

19:32.655 --> 19:36.157
It's a fun shampoo holder.

19:36.192 --> 19:37.432
Millions of lives are at stake!

19:40.363 --> 19:42.296
It's a plastic thingy
with flowery body wash.

19:44.734 --> 19:46.008
Come on!

19:52.416 --> 19:53.599
Patrick!

19:55.919 --> 19:57.394
He's a good kid!

20:03.286 --> 20:04.910
Principal Karen:
Frankie! I got a signal!

20:04.946 --> 20:06.670
It's close by!

20:06.705 --> 20:08.572
Hawk! Hawk!

20:10.985 --> 20:12.960
All right, Hawk.
It's now or never.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.787
(majestic music playing)

20:18.626 --> 20:20.909
You're gonna make it out there!

20:20.945 --> 20:22.547
I know you're not meant
to live in the wild,

20:22.571 --> 20:24.071
but it's either this
or the cage,

20:24.106 --> 20:27.633
and you've gotta
take that chance.

20:27.668 --> 20:31.762
And I, uh, packed you some
kale in case you get hungry.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.134
And don't let the other owls tell
you that veganism is pretentious.

20:34.158 --> 20:39.028
It's a life choice, and they
can mind their own business.

20:39.063 --> 20:42.356
Now go! Be free
and live your best life!

20:47.721 --> 20:49.280
Freedom beckons!

20:51.192 --> 20:52.741
Ahhhhh, shoot.

20:54.636 --> 20:58.130
- Hawk!
- (gasp) Oh, my gosh!

20:58.165 --> 20:59.998
Where did it come from?

21:00.034 --> 21:02.251
Paige! What did you do?

21:04.855 --> 21:06.755
Principal Karen, uh,
I can explain.

21:08.743 --> 21:11.043
I know it was wrong
to take Hawk,

21:11.078 --> 21:13.298
but... this animal should not
have to live its entire life

21:13.322 --> 21:15.105
locked in a prison.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.816
He deserves to be free.

21:17.852 --> 21:20.786
I agree. That's why we need to get
him back to the sanctuary right now.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.547
Sanctuary?

21:23.582 --> 21:25.699
I thought Hawk lived
in this cage at school.

21:25.735 --> 21:28.736
Oh, no. The school only brings
Hawk out for pep rallies.

21:28.771 --> 21:30.766
Then he goes right back to a
hundred-acre nature sanctuary

21:30.790 --> 21:32.881
where he can roam free.
It's an incredible life.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.992
In fact, this is the longest
Hawk's ever been in his cage.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.036
He's probably miserable.

21:39.081 --> 21:40.998
We... fed him a mouse.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.935
But you two did commit a crime.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.122
So your punishment is to
take an owl safety seminar.

21:48.157 --> 21:50.582
Oh. That's not so bad.

21:50.618 --> 21:52.858
It's six hours long, and I teach
it mostly through dance.

21:54.797 --> 21:57.331
Frankie/Paige: Ahhhh.

21:57.366 --> 21:59.082
You'll also have to pay
a steep fine,

21:59.117 --> 22:00.576
and serve community service.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.269
Now, come on, Hawk.

22:02.304 --> 22:04.429
Let's get you back
to your treetop mansion.

22:04.465 --> 22:06.398
Where the only limit you have
is the sky.

22:06.433 --> 22:09.384
Wow.

22:09.419 --> 22:17.419
We should not have
gotten involved.
