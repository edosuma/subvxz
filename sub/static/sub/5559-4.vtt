WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.037
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.071 --> 00:04.205
VEGA: I want you
to come work with me.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.373
A Precog?
Shh.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.708
Is helping you?

00:07.741 --> 00:08.776
VEGA:
Akeela, no one can know.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.411
I programed this to detect

00:10.444 --> 00:13.347
the fluctuations
and give a 30-second warning.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.582
That way if you're,
you know,

00:14.615 --> 00:15.649
at a cocktail party
or something,

00:15.683 --> 00:16.784
you can slip away.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.253
Also understand that

00:19.287 --> 00:21.622
your job performance reflects
on the men and women

00:21.655 --> 00:23.257
of this department.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.159
Yes.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.828
And that if you mess up,
we all mess up.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.830
If Agatha won't tell you,
I will.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.299
Tell me what?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.703
BLAKE:
Impressive.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.605
So impressive that, uh,

00:37.638 --> 00:38.806
to be honest, uh,

00:38.839 --> 00:42.210
I have questions.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.677
Where's my money?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.679
You've got nowhere
to go, Charlie.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.847
What do you want?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.716
(chuckles)

00:54.188 --> 00:56.124
(panting)

00:56.157 --> 00:58.092
Sorry.
It's okay.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.497
(computer chimes)

01:05.166 --> 01:06.300
Anoushka?

01:06.334 --> 01:07.635
Stop talking.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
(computer dinging)

01:09.703 --> 01:11.572
Wait right here.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.477
Allow entry.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.847
Sorry, Anoushka.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.150
Apparently it's always
brother time these days.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.719
Please, come in.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.854
You said we
needed to talk.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.157
So let's talk.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.625
I know you're new to social cues

01:31.659 --> 01:33.194
of civilized society,

01:33.227 --> 01:35.496
but it's polite to call first.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.564
You're my brother.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.666
Yeah, still.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.434
Can this wait?
DASH: You tell me.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.670
You and Agatha are the ones
saying the sky is falling.

01:42.703 --> 01:46.174
I don't think it's
time-sensitive at this moment.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.811
(sighs)

01:53.947 --> 01:56.884
What exactly did she see?

01:56.917 --> 01:59.553
I told you already.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.189
Vega standing next
to a milk bath.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.291
Don't shoot the messenger.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.792
I got to tell her about this.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.594
Don't.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.796
That's exactly why Agatha wanted
to keep this from you.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.531
Our lives are at stake,

02:10.564 --> 02:11.665
and if she's right,
then your new partners'

02:11.699 --> 02:13.367
the one that sells us out.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.269
Vega is not an enemy.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.904
Okay.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.307
You just met her;
I'm your brother, but okay.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.441
Arthur, come on.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.342
Oh, spare me.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.576
Every time we help her,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.712
we risk putting ourselves

02:24.745 --> 02:25.813
closer to the edge.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.548
No, next time you need my help

02:27.581 --> 02:29.917
for one of your good deeds,
I'm not nothing be here.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.819
For all you know,
she could be the one to save us

02:31.852 --> 02:33.887
from whatever it is that's
going to get us caught again.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.956
Then keep her close
but keep the secret, Dash,

02:35.989 --> 02:37.658
until we know more.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.227
She already knows too much.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.561
I have to go.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.603
VEGA:
There were three of them,

02:49.637 --> 02:51.805
Dash, Arthur, and Agatha.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.475
They were called
the Precognitives.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.511
They could see murders
before they happened.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.348
For six years, our police
held them against their will

03:00.381 --> 03:02.450
and used them to save lives.

03:02.483 --> 03:05.486
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

03:05.519 --> 03:08.589
they were finally released.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.625
They kept themselves safe
and hidden from the world

03:11.659 --> 03:13.761
until now.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.799
BLAKE:
Hawk-Eye is an important

03:18.832 --> 03:19.967
part of fighting crime.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.335
But remember,

03:21.369 --> 03:23.003
when you are out in the field,

03:23.036 --> 03:25.806
you are analysts, not cops.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.608
Process the data

03:27.641 --> 03:31.612
and help your officer assess
the next best course of action.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.781
Tomorrow,
you officially hit the streets.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.851
Dismissed.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.987
Has Dash actually

03:40.020 --> 03:41.289
had a job before?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.790
Precrime, remember?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.392
He used to work here.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.797
BLAKE:
Dash, Vega.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.935
Well, the official
partner handoff.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.637
I'll take good care of her, sir.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.508
Is a thing I hear people say.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.543
(chuckles)

04:02.576 --> 04:03.744
I know it's hard for you, Vega,

04:03.777 --> 04:05.379
after all of our time together.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.581
Not as hard as all
of our time together.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.482
(chuckles)

04:10.684 --> 04:11.952
Good luck.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.487
Yeah.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.722
Cool!

04:14.755 --> 04:17.591
You've got the vintage '48.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.026
The-the watch.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.894
Oh, this?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.696
Actually, Wally retrofitted this
for me.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.031
It monitors
my body temperature

04:24.064 --> 04:25.866
and warns me
before I'm gonna see a murder,

04:25.899 --> 04:27.668
because, you know, I tend
to collapse and convulse.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.836
Dash.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.571
Yep.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.040
All right.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.008
See you later.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.045
(sighs)

04:38.078 --> 04:40.013
Are you okay?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.349
You seem a little
weird today.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.351
I mean, weirder than usual.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.385
(chuckles)

04:44.418 --> 04:46.019
No, I'm fine, thanks.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.722
Okay, then.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.791
Big, official first
day tomorrow.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.959
Yeah.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.093
Get some rest.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.462
Sure.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.963
Um...

04:59.867 --> 05:03.837
You know, we need to separate
our work from our personal life.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.373
You need someone
you can talk to

05:05.373 --> 05:06.607
besides me.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.576
Okay.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.678
But how is that possible

05:10.711 --> 05:12.813
when the most significant thing
about me

05:12.846 --> 05:14.948
is something that
I can't share with anyone?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.850
Except me.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.721
That would be nice, yes.
You want to get some food?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.756
(chuckles)

05:22.790 --> 05:25.393
(wristband buzzing)

05:25.426 --> 05:26.594
You need to go to the bathroom.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.563
Yes, I do.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.415
(bell dinging)

05:57.591 --> 05:59.727
How did you sleep?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.662
I want my money.
And I will give it to you

06:01.695 --> 06:04.765
once you finish the job.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.969
Under the table,
you'll find a package.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.004
Your instructions are in there,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.840
along with some funding
to get it done.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.875
Follow them to the letter.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.745
So you're paying me my own money
to do something for you.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.848
Think of it as
a charitable donation, Charlie.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.150
I'd sooner kill you right here,
right now

06:23.183 --> 06:24.852
than to be your errand boy

06:24.885 --> 06:26.787
to earn back
what's rightfully mine.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.789
Look over my right shoulder.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.459
In 20 seconds,
Sheriff Lasser is going to

06:31.492 --> 06:33.561
open that door, walk in,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.896
order oatmeal
and whole wheat toast.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.197
So you'd better
kill me quickly,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.667
Charlie,
before you do something rash,

06:39.700 --> 06:42.970
and he finds out how you stole
what's rightfully yours.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.873
(bell dinging)

06:47.140 --> 06:49.677
Same old?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.044
Let's mix it up today.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.880
Oatmeal and a slice
of whole wheat,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.114
heavy on the butter.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.651
You can't outrun me, Charlie.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.087
I'll always be a step ahead.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.490
And it's not like
you have anywhere to hide.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.158
Don't forget the package.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.749
(groaning)

07:30.217 --> 07:32.152
(winces)

07:32.185 --> 07:34.622
(doorbell dinging)

07:34.655 --> 07:35.756
Ask who it is.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.224
I know who it is.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.192
(groans)
(door opens)

07:39.226 --> 07:41.529
Hey.
Hey.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.897
(door closes)

07:43.931 --> 07:45.533
WALLY:
Wow, this just got

07:45.533 --> 07:47.635
very official very fast.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.169
Wally, I told you Akeela
was joining the team.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.804
(scoffs)

07:50.838 --> 07:52.640
So, Vega tells me
after Precrime went down,

07:52.673 --> 07:56.209
you made a ton of money
inventing some game app?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.811
TimeRaft.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.779
You play?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.947
Once or twice.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.715
You're a level eight conjurer

08:01.749 --> 08:03.584
in a survival group
with your niece, Samara,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.252
and her brother, Jude.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.286
I can still read

08:06.319 --> 08:07.721
the customer log.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.857
But you tell me,
how did Sprawl punk

08:09.890 --> 08:13.093
who tattooed her face to fool
facial recognition cameras

08:13.126 --> 08:14.828
wind up as a cop?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.830
You know, you used to cash
a Metro paycheck, too.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.832
Or was your detail limited

08:18.866 --> 08:20.768
to giving Precogs foot massages?

08:20.801 --> 08:21.735
VEGA:
Knock it off.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.604
You're both pretty.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.807
DASH: How about we try
to identify the face

08:26.840 --> 08:28.008
from my new murder vision?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.282
VEGA:
A confrontation.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.984
Blood splatters on a statue.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.952
A bracelet rolls away,
and the kill.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.153
What kind of dog is that?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.789
WALLY:
Czechoslovakian

08:41.822 --> 08:43.090
vlcak.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.292
Pure-breds are rare.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.027
Must be licensed to someone.
I'll run a search.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.228
No need.
Already got them.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.230
There seems to be a few
in the city.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.066
Marjorie Fox, Cayman Bello,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.234
Declan Brown.
Cayman Bello?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.803
Of the Bello family?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.270
The very same.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.072
Mommy's a senator,
Daddy was old money,

08:59.106 --> 09:01.108
just passed away,
and just like that,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.610
Cayman is one of D.C.'s

09:02.643 --> 09:04.612
top philanthropists.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.747
Also easy on the eyes.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.616
That's him.
That's the murderer.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.618
But who's the woman?

09:10.651 --> 09:11.885
I didn't see her face.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.253
You need to call your brother.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.855
He won't... I can't, I mean.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.923
He's out of town.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.626
You could start with Bello.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.260
His charity's holding
a small function

09:20.293 --> 09:21.929
for its most generous donors

09:21.962 --> 09:23.130
today.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.632
The country house.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.999
I'll clear you
on the guest list.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.001
Oh.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.302
Want to crash a party?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.639
Well, let me see
what I have going on.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.940
Sure.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.059
What a generous donation,
Mr. and Mrs. Canally.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.894
Thank you for joining us today.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.729
Just stay close

09:55.763 --> 09:57.798
and look for anything that
stands out from your vision.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.667
The dog, the statue.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
You see

10:05.405 --> 10:06.774
Cayman anywhere?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.241
No.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.910
Oh, no, this guy.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.278
Lara.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.379
Mingle.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.682
(sighs)

10:14.715 --> 10:16.650
What are you doing here?

10:16.684 --> 10:17.851
Can't a cop have

10:17.885 --> 10:19.286
a favorite charity, counselor?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.888
(chuckles)

10:20.921 --> 10:23.023
How are you?
Very well, thank you.

10:48.348 --> 10:52.052
Terracotta Army fan,
are you?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.354
Yes.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.156
These are interesting.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.158
Oh, well, if you like these,
he's got some jade

10:58.191 --> 10:59.793
at the vineyard
that will make you swoon.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.394
Martha's.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.463
I don't know her.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.067
Ah, she's an old hag.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.401
Let me guess-- artist?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.738
Yes, I...

11:10.771 --> 11:12.439
sketch occasionally.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.074
But your real passion is...

11:14.107 --> 11:16.143
uh...

11:16.176 --> 11:17.410
Don't tell me.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.946
I'm pretty good at guessing.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.448
I just got to warn you--
so am I.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.284
I say perennial
blue ribbon winner

11:24.317 --> 11:26.453
at your high school
science fair.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.121
Actually, um,

11:28.155 --> 11:29.356
not much time for school.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.858
I started...

11:30.891 --> 11:32.960
working pretty early.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.763
You just became
the most interesting person

11:35.763 --> 11:37.197
at this party.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.398
I don't think
anyone here

11:38.431 --> 11:40.067
has worked an honest day
in their lives.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.769
Which reminds me,

11:41.802 --> 11:44.471
I put together Cayman's
guest list for this party.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.373
I don't believe you were on it.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.376
Relax, I'm not gonna
throw you out or anything.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.343
(chuckles)

11:50.377 --> 11:51.511
I'm Fredi.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.080
Fredi Kincaid.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.147
Dash.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.886
Can I have it back?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.253
Uh...

12:00.287 --> 12:03.523
you're friends
with Cayman Bello?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.292
I work at his foundation.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.527
I do some fundraising,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.797
but I'm babysitting
Cayman mostly.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.364
Does he get into much trouble?

12:11.398 --> 12:14.067
Nothing he can't
slip his way out of.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.037
DASH:
Uh, Fredi?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.105
Do you have a dog?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.439
No.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.808
Allergic.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.309
Why?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.811
Just making small talk.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.379
Are you working tomorrow?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.514
Yes.
VEGA:
There you are!

12:27.547 --> 12:30.050
Ah...
Hi!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.118
Fredi here

12:31.151 --> 12:32.185
works at the Bello Group.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.554
This is Vega.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.823
Really?
Hello.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.192
Who put this on?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.329
I'll take care of it.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.430
Yeah, do that.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.132
Something from this century?

12:45.165 --> 12:47.334
Please?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.037
Okay, so he hates good music.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.571
Noted.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.974
You get anything?
Yeah.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.843
Her-- she's wearing
the bracelet.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.978
The one that I saw.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.048
VEGA: She's the
murder victim.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.188
Fredi Kincaid--
28 years old

13:08.221 --> 13:11.058
She's been working for Bello
for the past six months.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.559
But there's not
much else on her.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.127
Which unfortunately means
not much

13:14.161 --> 13:16.063
on who would want to kill her.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.499
I should stay close to her.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.434
Don't you mean "we"?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.436
If w stay close to her,

13:23.470 --> 13:24.905
we're following her.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.439
If I go with her alone,

13:26.473 --> 13:28.475
I'm right next to her.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.246
You want to ask her out

13:33.280 --> 13:34.982
on a date.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.984
It's called "going undercover."

13:40.287 --> 13:42.155
Why? You don't think she would
be interested in me or...?

13:42.189 --> 13:44.457
No! No, I didn't say that...

13:44.491 --> 13:46.493
But, um...
Give him a wire.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.297
Okay, then.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.634
You wear these.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.104
And we'll be your eyes and ears

13:57.137 --> 13:58.571
the whole time just in case.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.107
No, I don't need any help.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.541
This is a police operation.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.410
You either put those on
or I chaperone.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.178
(sighs)

14:07.647 --> 14:09.549
Activate lenses.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.954
Whoa!

14:13.987 --> 14:17.090
Okay, this is pretty cool.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.492
VEGA:
It's a sensory overload
at first.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.095
Ask to hide data.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.131
Hide data!

14:24.164 --> 14:25.398
You can sub-vocalize it.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.968
Whatever you want
the system to do,

14:28.001 --> 14:29.636
just think it with your tongue.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.272
(indistinct chatter)

14:32.305 --> 14:35.242
All right, here goes.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.177
She better be nice to him.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.446
Hey, Fredi!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.281
Dash, right?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.283
You said you'd be at work today.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.118
I did.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.388
I just wanted to check.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.590
Are you a crazy person?

14:50.623 --> 14:53.994
I don't personally think so.
(chuckles)

14:54.027 --> 14:55.395
(quiet laugh)

14:55.428 --> 14:57.497
But it was loud
at the party,

14:57.530 --> 15:00.567
and I wanted to talk more.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.470
So I was wondering if you might
want to join me for dinner?

15:03.503 --> 15:06.573
Uh, that girl I saw you with?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.308
Is just a girl I was with.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.609
She's nothing.
It's just a friend.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.279
I would argue
better than nothing.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.215
Well, I-I have plans, but--

15:15.248 --> 15:16.316
What about tomorrow?

15:16.349 --> 15:19.219
For meals... or beverages?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.388
Uh, but what I was gonna say is

15:21.421 --> 15:23.156
would you like to join me?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.025
It's a barbecue at Cayman's.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.427
Barbecue, uh, for work?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.262
Not officially.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.031
It's just Cayman hanging out

15:31.064 --> 15:32.699
with his usual
insufferable crew.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.534
I mean, he wants
to talk to me

15:34.567 --> 15:36.636
about improving the foundation.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.637
That sounds terrible.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.739
I know.
Want to come?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.741
(both laugh)

15:41.774 --> 15:43.543
Do you think I'll fit in?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.045
No, not at all.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.379
Thank God!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.716
Come on.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.023
Kid's gonna be all right.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.358
Yeah.
(laughs)

16:06.766 --> 16:08.468
Water?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.370
Or something stronger,
Mr...?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.073
Peele.
But I'm looking to change that.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.742
I was told that you
supply identities.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.410
I'm an estate planner.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.046
Yeah, I'm gonna need

16:19.046 --> 16:20.247
something with high
security clearance,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.350
DoD with site access.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.118
Sure, we keep that in stock.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.454
I'm here because
Agatha sent me.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.589
And she said I could count
on a family discount?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.163
(sighs)

16:43.670 --> 16:45.072
Okay.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.613
*

17:03.856 --> 17:05.792
CAYMAN:
Fredi!

17:05.825 --> 17:07.527
You're here, finally.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.396
Huh, well, now looks like
Cayman might be in to Fredi

17:09.429 --> 17:10.797
for more than
just a work thing.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.100
Maybe she invited Dash
to make him jealous.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.368
And land a rich
sugar daddy.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.836
Dash, seriously?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.338
I can hear you.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.339
Then say, "Mute."

17:19.372 --> 17:20.340
Mute.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
Sorry?
Nothing.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.777
We're thinking of catching
the midnight Space Blue

17:24.811 --> 17:26.679
and grabbing brek
in Singapore.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.814
Care to join?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.816
I work tomorrow.
You work for me.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.618
And besides, we're gonna
be back in plenty of time.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.852
You can bring your intern.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.187
He's my friend.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.488
This is Dash.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.224
Okay, Whit's a dick.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.791
Whitman Cho--
grew up with Cayman.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.393
High school,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.295
college, lacrosse camp.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.830
Oh, well, there you go.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.732
Don't hate on lacrosse!

17:45.765 --> 17:46.733
FREDI:
Pretty big party, Cayman.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.168
But you said last night

17:48.201 --> 17:49.402
you wanted to talk
about work.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.837
CAYMAN:
I did? Doesn't sound like me.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.772
(barking)

17:52.805 --> 17:54.341
Oh, easy, easy.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.476
Muffy isn't socialized.
There you go.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.245
(whispers): The dog.
VEGA: Yeah, we see it.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.679
Is everything okay?

17:59.712 --> 18:00.847
Yes.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.416
Yeah, I just, I'm a,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.452
I'm a cat person.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.887
CAYMAN:
So, Dash?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.856
I don't think
I caught your last name.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.491
Are you from around here?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.360
Leave it vague.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.495
Parker, Dash Parker.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.729
Hmm, of the Virginia Parkers?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.432
Did he just say
"the Virginia Parkers"?

18:19.466 --> 18:20.867
They really talk like that?

18:20.900 --> 18:23.403
I'm, uh, I'm not sure.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.172
Not sure?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.607
Guys.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.876
It's okay.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.844
My drug addict mother
had the good grace

18:31.878 --> 18:33.513
to almost carry me to term.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.847
VEGA:
Careful, Dash.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.349
I spent my infancy
in an incubator.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.650
Childhood in foster care.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.554
And later years
in lesser accommodations.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.490
So, yeah, I'm not sure
if the name comes from Virginia,

18:43.523 --> 18:45.325
but I'll look into it.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.460
I'm sorry.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.929
That's, uh, that's awful.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.498
Isn't that why you ask?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.604
Seems like a good time to go.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.440
Dash, you can't leave her.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.874
The murder could be
happening tonight.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.210
I know what I'm doing.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.744
Wait.

19:04.777 --> 19:05.812
Dash?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.215
Dash, wait.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.284
I'm sorry about that.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.453
That's okay.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.457
Let's get out of here.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.769
I love it down here.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.271
Some people don't get it.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.240
Yeah, it's good energy.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.674
It's real.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.842
Cayman and company back there

19:35.875 --> 19:38.711
can be kind of soul-crushing.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.414
Why would you want to be
friends with people like that?

19:41.448 --> 19:43.416
I don't.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.585
It's just, uh...

19:45.618 --> 19:47.587
complicated.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.256
It's personal.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.290
I'm a person.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.925
Tell me.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.863
Those guys went to college
with my sister.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.965
They were her so-called friends.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.833
They all went to the
cape one summer.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.404
And she really
wanted me to come, but...

20:04.437 --> 20:05.705
What happened?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.707
Where's your sister now?

20:07.740 --> 20:10.343
Depends on what kind of god
you believe in.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.312
I'm sorry.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.646
What sister?

20:13.680 --> 20:14.947
Get a name.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.283
What was her name?

20:16.316 --> 20:19.752
Alison.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.754
They were responsible.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.491
I know they were.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.025
That's why you took this job.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.594
To find proof.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.764
I don't know why I trust you,
but I do.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.368
Is that crazy?

20:35.402 --> 20:38.638
I'm the wrong person to ask.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.740
(chuckles)

20:42.809 --> 20:45.345
Okay, tell me everything.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.747
And don't go wandering off
like that again, Dash.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.382
You knew I was safe.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.550
Yeah, well,
we don't know this girl.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.884
You saw the whole thing.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.486
We just talked
and then I walked her home

20:53.520 --> 20:55.888
and we, you know,
we hung out until dawn.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.325
And nobody tried to kill her?
You seem disappointed.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.860
So far you haven't seen a vision
more than three days out,

21:00.893 --> 21:02.729
which means the murder
must be happening tonight.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.697
That is when she's planning to
confront Cayman with the proof.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.567
That Cayman was responsible
for her sister's death.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.902
She said she needed to get past
his security system to find it.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.505
It's a high-tech system;
I told her I would help.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
Help? You're getting pretty
cocky with this girl.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.609
How exactly do you
plan to do that?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.445
I know a guy.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.684
ARTHUR:
She's kind of cute.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.052
You like her?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.054
I find her attractive.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.457
Charming, yes.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.026
Look, what we're
trying to do here

21:34.060 --> 21:35.895
doesn't come close
to Agatha's vision.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.630
Fredi is harmless.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.600
She doesn't seem like
the Seventh Sign, you're right.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.603
And you could stand to have
a non-cop girlfriend.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.373
These are the schematics
for the security system.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.111
(whistles)

21:52.144 --> 21:54.046
DASH:
Can you help?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.682
Top of the line.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.016
She's willing to pay.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.757
My guy's in the Sprawl.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.726
Tell him I sent you.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.406
I bet this is where
you take all the girls.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.880
Arthur sent us.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.682
We're friends.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.860
So what do you have for me?

22:40.893 --> 22:41.928
The system's owner.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.930
Just grabbed it from his office.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.998
Hopefully the scotch won't
cancel out the DNA.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.166
Should be enough.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.135
Let's get started, shall we?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.846
What is that?
Tissue printer.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.081
I hope you don't have any plans
for the next two hours.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.965
Where are they now?
What'd I miss?

23:18.998 --> 23:19.966
The Sprawl.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.501
One of Arthur's guys.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.669
Gonna help them break
Cayman's security.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.671
Could be a while.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.539
Wonder how they'll
spend their time.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.040
You got something for me?

23:28.074 --> 23:30.176
I looked up Fredi's sister.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.178
There's no record of
any Alison Kincaid.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.213
She lied about the name.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.750
But I did dig up some dirt
on Cayman and his crew.

23:37.784 --> 23:41.721
Him, Whitman Cho and this
guy named Matt Hildebrandt

23:41.754 --> 23:43.823
used to rent a
place in the Cape.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.191
Every summer, actually,
until two years ago.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.192
Two years ago?

23:46.225 --> 23:48.194
That's when it happened.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.863
Do we know who else they went
up there with? Any girls?

23:50.897 --> 23:52.599
No, nothing yet,
but I'm still looking.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.641
It's ready.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.513
What is it?

24:06.513 --> 24:09.215
FREDI: Our key to Cayman's
security system.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.518
SCIENTIST:
Peekaboo.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.256
We did it, Dash.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.791
We did it, you did.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.627
Just trying to help.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.010
DASH:
So do you want coffee

24:38.044 --> 24:39.879
or this old coffee?

24:39.912 --> 24:41.213
(chuckles)

24:41.247 --> 24:42.649
Choices, choices.

24:42.682 --> 24:43.850
This is kind of all I got.

24:43.883 --> 24:44.984
I'm good, thanks.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.587
"Fiddler's Neck."

24:47.620 --> 24:48.921
Is this where you grew up?

24:48.955 --> 24:52.792
I didn't peg you
as a country boy.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.126
Guess that explains
the good manners.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.696
Well, we sort of moved
there later in life.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.665
DASH:
Fresh start.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.301
Must have been hard.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.571
I knew kids who grew up
in the system.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.573
They all have
a hard time getting close.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.912
DASH:
I wish I could tell you

25:12.945 --> 25:15.014
that I couldn't remember
everything that happened.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.917
But I do.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.856
So whenever it's quiet

25:23.890 --> 25:26.859
or dark or...

25:26.893 --> 25:30.863
anytime, really...

25:30.897 --> 25:33.833
I am back there...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.806
...seeing it.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.074
Seeing what?

25:42.108 --> 25:44.176
Careful, Dash.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.117
More than any kid
should ever have to.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.954
It was too much for
too long to forget.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.956
And you want to forget.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.324
No, I don't.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.193
I don't want to forget it.

26:01.227 --> 26:04.897
And that way, it won't
be a waste of my life.

26:04.931 --> 26:05.932
(chuckles)

26:05.965 --> 26:09.936
That's all I want too.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.239
For Alison,
not to be forgotten.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.081
What happened?

26:22.114 --> 26:24.951
What did Cayman
do to her?

26:24.984 --> 26:27.319
She was dating Cayman.

26:27.353 --> 26:31.924
The two of them and some
of his friends were partying

26:31.958 --> 26:34.260
down at the Cape.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.930
There were drugs,
and she overdosed.

26:39.866 --> 26:43.970
Cayman panicked, and...
he just left her there.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.938
They all did.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.809
They let her die.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.111
And then they said that
they weren't even there.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.383
They all had
very good lawyers.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.385
VEGA:
Ask if she has proof.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.321
How do you know that
he was there with her?

27:02.354 --> 27:05.257
I just know.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.695
If only I could place them there
though with some evidence.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.697
That's why I need
to do this.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.868
We'll get it.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.372
We'll get it tonight.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.341
I'll help you.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.147
AKEELA:
Did I miss the best part?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.983
All of it.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.719
Thank you.
Bummer.

27:32.719 --> 27:35.021
What'd you find?

27:35.054 --> 27:37.089
My search turned up
five girls

27:37.123 --> 27:39.726
who visited the Cape with Cayman
and his pals that summer.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.365
Alison Carrigan.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.900
Different last name,

27:47.934 --> 27:49.902
but I'd say there's
a family resemblance.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.470
But it gets better.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.005
Cayman's friend
Matt Hildebrandt?

27:53.039 --> 27:54.874
You tracked him down?
He's dead.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.809
Six months ago,
swallowed a bunch of pills

27:56.843 --> 27:58.811
in his bedroom in rehab;
ruled a suicide.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.479
And here's the good part.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.449
The day he overdosed,
he had one visitor.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.855
Ricki Carrigan.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.757
Alison's sister.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.091
Ricki goes by the name of...

28:12.124 --> 28:13.459
BOTH:
Fredi.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.162
So she could gain access
to Cayman and his friends.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.797
Because Fredi believes that
they killed her sister,

28:17.830 --> 28:19.465
she wants revenge.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.033
And she's already killed
one man to get it.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.201
Okay, run
everything you can.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.070
We need proof that
Cayman was there

28:24.103 --> 28:25.404
the night that
Alison was killed.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.206
Labor Day weekend, 2063.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.208
Yeah, I'll bet Cayman's
lawyers ended it

28:29.241 --> 28:31.978
before the local sheriff
got her pants on.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.946
Where are you going?
I'm pulling Dash out.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.992
So how do you feel
about Bermuda?

28:46.025 --> 28:49.328
We go in tonight,

28:49.361 --> 28:52.865
expose Cayman to the world,

28:52.899 --> 28:54.200
and then run away.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.167
(chuckles)

28:57.569 --> 28:59.538
Someone's at the door.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.373
I didn't hear
anything.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.948
Not a good time.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.818
You just slept
with a killer, Dash.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.985
What are you talking about?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.253
Fredi lied about her name.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.322
It's Ricki, Ricki Carrigan.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.090
And she's not after proof;
she wants revenge.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.392
How do you even
know all of this?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.929
Ask her about Matt Hildebrandt,
he's one of Cayman's friends.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.563
He was in rehab,
but conveniently O.D.'d

29:24.596 --> 29:26.098
right after a visit
with your girlfriend.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.434
You don't know that for sure.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.969
Maybe...

29:30.002 --> 29:31.971
maybe she confronted
him with the truth,

29:32.004 --> 29:35.107
and he felt guilty
and killed himself.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.475
Dash, listen to yourself.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.344
This is going
down tonight.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.179
She got to you too.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.848
She's not a murderer.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.015
And you know that how?

29:43.049 --> 29:44.416
Because I know killers, Vega.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.953
And I know her.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.888
(door opens)

29:50.256 --> 29:51.557
I heard yelling.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.559
No, we were
just talking.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.327
FREDI: We met
at the party.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.596
You two really aren't...?

29:57.629 --> 29:58.597
No.
No.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.999
No way.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.201
Vega was just leaving.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.271
It's good to see you again.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.311
Do you need
to follow her?

30:12.344 --> 30:14.613
No.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.048
No.

30:16.082 --> 30:19.051
In that case, get ready.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.854
It's time.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.344
Damn it, Dash!

30:57.924 --> 31:00.126
Sir.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.994
Something wrong?
Could be the scanner.

31:02.028 --> 31:02.929
Got your badge?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.296
Yeah.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.136
Mother's maiden?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.270
Flitcraft.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.074
Have a nice day.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.143
MAN:
All right, next.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.063
He cut me off.
He's off the grid.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.264
What do you mean
he's off the grid?

31:38.297 --> 31:39.431
He took his earpiece
and his lenses out.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.000
He's trusting her.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.434
Well, we know they're going
to Bello's house, right?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.435
I'm on my way there right now.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.637
You have anything
on the night Alison died?

31:45.671 --> 31:46.672
No, not yet,
but I'm getting close.

31:46.705 --> 31:47.673
Well, you better hurry.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.187
I'm only authorized
for the entrance.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.588
(scanner beeps)

32:02.621 --> 32:04.623
I told Cayman I needed him
to sign something.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.525
He's waiting
for me upstairs.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.360
He's expecting you?
Of course.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.997
He expects me
to be on call 24/7.

32:10.997 --> 32:14.533
And tonight,
I'm only too happy to oblige.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.302
You coming?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.276
So where's the proof?

32:24.310 --> 32:26.412
What?
The evidence.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.115
The proof that Cayman was with
Alison the night that she died.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.282
Isn't that why we're here?

32:30.316 --> 32:31.383
There is no proof.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.252
We're here for
the eyewitness.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.186
Cayman?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.387
I'm gonna get him to confess.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.365
Fredi.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.367
Fredi, wait.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.169
Fredi, stop.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.538
You can't do this.
What are you talking about?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.706
(scanner beeps)

32:54.740 --> 32:56.608
Tell me about Matt Hildebrandt.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.511
Where did you hear that name?

32:59.545 --> 33:02.381
He was there that night on the
beach with Alison, wasn't he?

33:02.414 --> 33:03.615
And now he's dead.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.716
An overdose.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.684
A suicide.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.485
Because you drove him to it?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.655
Is that what
you're doing here, too?

33:09.688 --> 33:12.558
What difference does it make
if it revealed the truth?

33:12.591 --> 33:14.726
Don't do this, Fredi.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.396
Maybe it was a mistake
to bring you here.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.298
This part I'll do alone.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.599
He's going to hurt you.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.301
No. He won't.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.270
I'm not the one
who gets hurt this time.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.574
(grunts)

33:28.607 --> 33:30.442
Fredi, don't do this!

33:31.543 --> 33:33.679
(scanner beeps)

33:33.712 --> 33:35.281
(grunts)

33:35.314 --> 33:37.783
Fredi!

33:37.816 --> 33:39.685
Fredi, you're better than this!

33:39.718 --> 33:40.786
Fredi!

33:50.829 --> 33:52.731
Hope I'm not intruding.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.334
Fredi. Didn't know
you'd just come up.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.435
Glad you did though.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.104
Yeah, you're right.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.339
Look at me, walking around
like I own the place.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.741
So what is it
I'm signing for you?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.443
How about a confession?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.148
What are you talking about?

34:13.252 --> 34:14.686
("Alison" by Elvis Costello
playing)

34:14.720 --> 34:17.223
Remember this song?

34:17.256 --> 34:19.225
She said you used to
play it for her.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.792
Turn it off.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.731
* Oh, it's so funny
to be seeing you *
(turns up volume)

34:25.764 --> 34:27.566
* After so long...

34:27.599 --> 34:29.801
Did she tell you
she had a sister?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.138
Ricki.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.372
Fredericka.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.440
You're...

34:34.473 --> 34:35.641
I am.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.610
Heard a lot about
you, Cayman.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.279
Can't say it's nice
to meet you though.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.680
What do you want?

34:41.713 --> 34:44.683
I want you to tell the truth.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.518
Just like Matt Hildebrandt did.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.254
Security breach!

34:48.287 --> 34:50.156
Emergency Richmond 10-41!
(alarm beeping)

34:50.189 --> 34:52.491
Leave and we will never
discuss this again.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.593
Otherwise, security will be
up here in two minutes.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.395
Actually, they won't.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.399
(scanner beeps)

35:00.432 --> 35:01.733
(alarm stops)

35:01.767 --> 35:03.269
Which means we can talk alone.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.172
* I only know it isn't mine

35:08.240 --> 35:11.543
* Alison

35:14.846 --> 35:16.748
* My aim is true.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.490
DASH: Fredi!
AKEELA:
Vega, I've got something.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.225
The night Fredi's sister died,

35:26.258 --> 35:27.726
Cayman's fixers tampered with
the eye-dents,

35:27.759 --> 35:28.760
the surveillance feed.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.329
But he missed one thing:

35:30.362 --> 35:31.863
the music they were
listening to.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.501
It's a subscription service,
streams to personal devices.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.269
It also keeps geo coordinates.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.604
Send it through.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.206
I'm five away.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.640
Fredi!

35:41.673 --> 35:43.609
(dog barking)

35:46.378 --> 35:47.646
You're here when it happens.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.549
Good boy.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.553
Your sister died
of a drug overdose.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.522
Her fault, not mine.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.391
She didn't want to die.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.427
You could've saved her.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.229
People like you pretend
there's no such thing

36:03.229 --> 36:04.696
as personal responsibility.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.432
No one forced
those drugs on her.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.567
But you loved
giving them to her.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.570
She wanted to get high.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.940
Because she wanted to fit in.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.408
But she never did.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.810
I got to give her
credit though, she really,

36:18.844 --> 36:20.446
really tried.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.815
So here's to Alison,
may she rest in peace.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.684
She had a little bit
of a drug problem,

36:25.717 --> 36:28.287
but she was
a very talented girl.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.257
(Cayman screams, dog barks)

36:31.290 --> 36:32.491
You shot me!

36:37.563 --> 36:39.431
DASH:
Fredi, wait!

36:39.465 --> 36:40.499
(groaning)

36:42.368 --> 36:43.335
Please.

36:43.369 --> 36:44.636
You need to listen to me.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.804
Dash, get out!

36:45.837 --> 36:47.506
I know what it's like.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.807
To obsess.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.808
You don't know the first thing.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.610
I know everything.

36:51.643 --> 36:52.878
My whole life,

36:52.911 --> 36:54.513
all I've seen are people

36:54.546 --> 36:55.981
making the same decisions
that you're about to make.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.617
And it doesn't help.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.918
It never does.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.553
I'll take my chances.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.854
(grunts softly)

37:02.888 --> 37:04.656
The police are gonna come

37:04.690 --> 37:06.692
walking through that door
in 40 seconds.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.826
How do you know that?

37:07.859 --> 37:10.296
Because I work for them.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.667
You lied to me?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.603
You need to leave.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.004
And let him
get away with it again?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.672
I am not gonna let that happen.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.042
Fredi, you are
better than this.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.877
You are better than him.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.546
I've come too far now.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.015
You have 13 seconds.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.116
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Security override.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.918
Metropolitan Police.
VEGA (in distance): Metro P.D.!

37:32.951 --> 37:33.985
You still have a choice.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.701
Go.
VEGA: Go, go, go!

37:49.735 --> 37:50.936
Go!

37:50.969 --> 37:52.338
Weapons tight.
Surround the suspect!

37:52.338 --> 37:53.339
Sweep the room.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.543
OFFICER:
Clear!

37:59.411 --> 38:00.679
Where is she, Dash?

38:00.712 --> 38:01.947
Where did she go?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.549
I just got here.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.451
Go! Go after her! She shot me!

38:05.484 --> 38:08.354
I don't know who you're
talking about, Mr. Bello.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.521
I'm here for you.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.056
What?
You're under arrest

38:11.089 --> 38:13.559
for the wrongful death
of Alison Carrigan.

38:13.592 --> 38:14.793
What are you talking about?
I wasn't there.

38:14.826 --> 38:15.994
Actually, you were.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.696
And I found evidence
to prove it.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.065
We searched the records
from your music provider.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.967
You, two of your friends,

38:22.000 --> 38:26.071
and Alison Carrigan synced
your devices on September 6,

38:26.104 --> 38:29.575
2063, at 11:44 p.m.

38:29.608 --> 38:33.512
GPS pins you to Ballston Beach,
on the Cape,

38:33.545 --> 38:36.482
at the exact time
of Alison's death.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.985
I need to talk to my lawyer.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.721
You know, I tried
reaching out to her already.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.390
She's in St. John.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.558
But you can wait in jail for her
till she gets back.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.461
Medics!

38:49.495 --> 38:51.430
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

38:54.032 --> 38:56.402
She wasn't a murderer.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.803
You were too close
to this, Dash.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.739
You can't see your own future.

39:00.772 --> 39:01.873
I didn't need to.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.512
I saw her.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.048
I was listening.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.717
What you told her.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.419
What you never told anyone.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.522
I heard you, too.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.430
It's been a long day.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.435
(sighs)

39:32.638 --> 39:34.840
I ran the search
you asked for.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.143
This is all I could find
under "Photonic Containment."

39:43.148 --> 39:45.617
This is good, Charles.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.453
Let's talk money.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.087
I want my money.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.156
The rest of your cash
is under the table.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.891
You can take it and leave.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.967
What I meant was it's
time to renegotiate.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.436
In all my years as a
security contractor

40:04.470 --> 40:08.039
for the Defense Department, I
never saw schematics like these.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.708
Three connected
neural interfaces,

40:09.741 --> 40:11.777
photon milk.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.712
It got me to thinking,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.848
what sort of government program
would build a thing like this?

40:19.084 --> 40:20.752
And then I remembered one.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.759
Agatha.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.101
So now we both have secrets.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.206
But there's no time
to threaten me, Charlie.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.775
U.S. Marshals will be here
in one minute.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.812
And they don't want wheat toast.

40:46.845 --> 40:47.813
You called them.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.915
No. But I saw it coming.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.550
You got sloppy.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.820
Tipped an eye-dent scan,
set off a location track.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.489
A fugitive should be
more careful, Charlie.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.225
Have I been wrong yet?

41:03.194 --> 41:05.731
Wrong way. Go out the back door.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.098
And, Charlie?

41:07.132 --> 41:09.701
They won't take you alive.

41:09.735 --> 41:10.669
So run.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.911
MAN: Charles Peele, this is
the U.S. Marshal! Don't move!

41:22.047 --> 41:24.015
Put the gun down now!
Bitch.

41:24.049 --> 41:24.115
Put the gun down now!
(gunfire in distance)
