00:10.583 --> 00:13.120
Say, aren't you Ernie Pantusso?

00:13.292 --> 00:15.536
- Are you talking to me, sir?
- Yeah.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.792
- Yes, l am.
- Well, l'll be damned.

00:18.961 --> 00:22.328
- Do you remember me?
- No, l'm sorry. l don't.

00:23.464 --> 00:25.953
- Let me give you a hint.
- l like hints.

00:26.131 --> 00:28.668
Shortstop.

00:28.841 --> 00:31.591
Topeka, 1 94 7.

00:31.759 --> 00:33.751
My nickname was ''Fancy Dan''.

00:33.924 --> 00:35.717
Joe Pitney!

00:35.885 --> 00:38.836
No, Ernie. l'm Dan Corelli.

00:39.012 --> 00:42.840
Danny Corelli!
My God, am l happy to see you!

00:43.012 --> 00:44.590
Everybody, listen up.

00:44.764 --> 00:47.796
This is one of the most
amazing men in the world.

00:47.972 --> 00:51.637
One of the most amazing men that ever
stepped into a baseball diamond.

00:51.806 --> 00:55.423
He was a great ball-player.
l know, l played against him.

00:55.602 --> 00:58.882
But, listen, the man is totally blind!

01:00.435 --> 01:05.474
- l'm not blind and l never was.
- Come on, Corelli, don't be modest.

01:05.645 --> 01:08.678
You were a legend.
You were an absolute legend.

01:08.855 --> 01:13.016
The whole league talked about
the blind man who played for Topeka.

01:13.190 --> 01:16.393
You're all confused.
They called me the Blind Man

01:16.568 --> 01:20.693
because l sold venetian blinds
door-to-door during the off season.

01:22.818 --> 01:25.486
My God, how did he find the doorbell?

01:27.278 --> 01:31.024
ls that an inspirational story or not?

01:31.196 --> 01:35.606
They didn't buy your product out of pity,
l'm telling you.

01:35.783 --> 01:40.737
- l'll see you later.
- Watch the steps there, please!

01:43.451 --> 01:46.201
l think he can see as well as we can.

01:46.369 --> 01:49.948
Carla, in some ways, he can see more.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.982 --> 03:10.680
- Thanks for the hot tip.
- What are you talking about?

03:10.857 --> 03:14.439
You said Vera's cousin Natalie
would go out with me.

03:14.610 --> 03:18.771
l didn't say she'd go out with you.
l said she'd go out with anyone.

03:18.944 --> 03:21.729
l called her and she shot me down.

03:21.903 --> 03:26.232
lt doesn't make any sense.
Vera said this woman was desperate.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.362
What did you say?

03:28.531 --> 03:31.946
l said hello, did my icebreaker joke,
and asked her out.

03:34.033 --> 03:36.701
What was your icebreaker joke?

03:36.868 --> 03:40.200
- A cute little pervert imitation l do.
- What?

03:40.368 --> 03:42.824
Not pervert,
more like an obscene phone call.

03:42.996 --> 03:47.122
Heavy breathing and all.
Ma roars at it.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.575
Hello, Natalie.

03:49.748 --> 03:51.987
What are you wearing?

03:52.164 --> 03:54.452
You wanna know what l'm...

03:55.251 --> 03:59.542
Yeah, sure.
Tomorrow you're all gonna be using it.

04:05.504 --> 04:09.748
Everyone raves about this place.
The chef is a genius.

04:09.962 --> 04:11.871
l'm so glad we got a reservation.

04:12.045 --> 04:15.331
- l want tonight to be perfect.
- lt will be.

04:15.507 --> 04:19.966
l'm gonna get the best table, no matter
how many palms l have to cross.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.755
<i>Buona notte.</i>

04:21.925 --> 04:23.964
Crane, party of two.

04:24.136 --> 04:25.511
Crane?

04:27.137 --> 04:28.793
Ah, Crane.

04:28.970 --> 04:31.505
- <i>Signore</i>, please, this way.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

04:31.678 --> 04:34.051
l'd like the finest table you have.

04:34.221 --> 04:35.965
Something quiet, near the...

04:38.058 --> 04:40.179
Any place is fine.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.638
lf the food's so good, why is it empty?

04:45.809 --> 04:47.719
l don't know.

04:48.436 --> 04:51.221
Welcome to Luigi's.

04:51.394 --> 04:55.721
Our world-renowned chef, Luigi,
would like to welcome you personally,

04:55.898 --> 04:58.813
but he's dead.

05:03.774 --> 05:08.847
We buried him this morning.
ls this table satisfactory?

05:09.026 --> 05:11.232
This morning? And you're open?

05:11.402 --> 05:15.810
Yes. lt was one of Luigi's last wishes.

05:17.069 --> 05:22.025
- Would it be easier on you if we left?
- No, no, no!

05:22.199 --> 05:26.855
The new man is a very fine cook.

05:27.033 --> 05:32.653
He studied under...
the world's greatest chef.

05:36.451 --> 05:39.487
Stay. Stay, <i>prego.</i>

05:39.662 --> 05:43.609
Well, we're very hungry.
Can you recommend an appetizer?

05:43.788 --> 05:47.404
Yes, the <i>Calamari alla Luigi...</i>

05:53.960 --> 05:55.913
is very good.

05:58.253 --> 06:04.202
Well, we'll have an order of that
and a bottle of your best chianti.

06:08.923 --> 06:11.591
Boy, can l show a girl a good time.

06:12.966 --> 06:15.752
Frasier, don't feel bad. lt's not your fault.

06:15.925 --> 06:21.296
l don't know. The harder l try
to please you, the more l mess up.

06:21.469 --> 06:26.044
l wanted tonight to be perfect
so that l could ask you to marry me.

06:27.264 --> 06:29.301
How you talk!

06:29.472 --> 06:34.179
Dr Marino arranged for us to marry
tomorrow at his estate in Florence.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.597
You're serious.

06:39.769 --> 06:43.975
Well, Diane, this trip
has put us to the test.

06:44.143 --> 06:47.060
l've seen you at your best
and your worst.

06:47.228 --> 06:50.228
l didn't think your worst
was all that bad.

06:50.396 --> 06:53.515
Especially when it was
only in small doses.

06:55.981 --> 06:57.853
The more l know you,

06:59.775 --> 07:01.516
the more l want you.

07:01.693 --> 07:05.390
Will you marry me and make me
the happiest man in the world?

07:11.153 --> 07:13.441
Frasier, l'm so nervous.

07:15.904 --> 07:20.316
l didn't have the slightest indication
this was coming.

07:21.076 --> 07:23.825
Well, of course, my...

07:23.991 --> 07:27.775
Look what l've done.
May l have your napkin?

07:29.869 --> 07:32.322
l'll be right back.

07:43.791 --> 07:46.078
Fancy answering machine, Sam.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.869
Deluxe model, top of the line.

07:49.042 --> 07:51.450
l can't talk to answering machines.

07:51.626 --> 07:55.373
And you're such a whiz with people.

07:55.547 --> 08:00.453
You think it's a convenience but
it's a poor substitute for a human being.

08:00.630 --> 08:03.963
- You should trash it.
- This is an expensive machine.

08:04.130 --> 08:06.916
l'm talking about Carla.

08:07.089 --> 08:09.333
Like to see her top that one.

08:12.053 --> 08:13.594
TouchÃ©!

08:16.303 --> 08:20.593
l'm not much for these things.
Why do you need one?

08:20.761 --> 08:24.462
l've been missing calls.
People screw up messages.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.554
We always get your messages right.

08:27.722 --> 08:31.590
Think we're too stupid
to take a message?

08:31.766 --> 08:33.474
That hurts, Sam.

08:33.642 --> 08:37.256
Sorry, but l think it's better
to have a machine.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.554
Does anyone know
how to record on this?

08:40.727 --> 08:43.052
You press that little red button.

08:43.229 --> 08:46.145
Talk right into the machine.
Keep it simple.

08:46.314 --> 08:51.018
Tell them to leave names and numbers.
l'll make jungle noises in the background.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.805
Quiet for a second, everybody.

08:57.735 --> 08:59.975
Hi, this is Sam Malone.

09:00.152 --> 09:04.647
Suckered you in. l'm not here.
Do you like talking to a machine?

09:06.486 --> 09:11.987
At the beep, leave your name, number,
and something that'll get me hot.

09:12.157 --> 09:14.561
Hope that was for your private line.

09:14.739 --> 09:17.823
l wouldn't waste a bon mot like that
on business stuff.

09:19.743 --> 09:24.034
- Would someone get that for me?
- Well, gee, l'll try.

09:24.201 --> 09:25.824
Hello?

09:25.995 --> 09:29.029
- Wanna help me, guys?
- Yeah. Hello?

09:29.204 --> 09:32.370
- Hello. Come in?
- Cheers.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.870
- Hello, it's me.
- Hold on a second.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.447
Been dreaming about me again?

09:41.625 --> 09:44.991
Actually, l'm calling to talk to everyone.

09:45.168 --> 09:49.032
Chat a little.
Tell you how nice the weather's been.

09:49.210 --> 09:52.625
How romantic Europe has been.

09:52.798 --> 09:54.918
Yes, it's been very romantic.

09:55.089 --> 09:58.170
The kind of place
that makes a man lose his head

09:58.341 --> 10:01.790
and propose to a gal
on a night such as this.

10:04.010 --> 10:06.677
So, who do you wanna speak to next?

10:08.220 --> 10:10.375
l'm talking about Frasier.

10:10.552 --> 10:15.341
He had a couple of sips of chianti tonight
and asked me to marry him.

10:15.511 --> 10:18.215
Did you say a couple of sips or barrels?

10:19.638 --> 10:23.849
- l knew you'd be this way.
- No, l'm not being any way.

10:24.016 --> 10:26.302
So what'd you tell him?

10:26.474 --> 10:30.802
l haven't told him anything yet.
l'm just basking in the moment.

10:30.977 --> 10:33.465
l see.

10:33.645 --> 10:38.220
So what's the problem? You told me
you and Frasier are a perfect match.

10:38.398 --> 10:40.303
There's no problem.

10:40.481 --> 10:45.473
Tell everyone that l'll call
after the wedding tomorrow.

10:45.648 --> 10:48.517
Tomorrow? What's the rush?

10:48.691 --> 10:52.901
Frasier has thoughtfully and romantically
arranged for us to be married

10:53.069 --> 10:55.108
at the Marino estate.

10:55.276 --> 11:00.399
lt's a landmark, one of the most
beautiful estates in Florence.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.440
So are you gonna say yes?

11:04.530 --> 11:07.234
You think l should say something else?

11:08.324 --> 11:09.900
No.

11:10.950 --> 11:14.150
No, you don't think
l should say something else,

11:14.327 --> 11:17.361
or no, you think l should say no?

11:17.535 --> 11:19.326
Yes.

11:20.037 --> 11:24.743
Yes, l should say yes,
or yes, l should say something else?

11:24.913 --> 11:28.281
Congratulations. l'm very happy for you.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.779
l see. lf you have
nothing more to say,

11:30.958 --> 11:33.626
l'd better be getting back to Frasier.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.919
You probably want to accept
before he sobers up.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.961
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.289
What's wrong, Sam?

11:49.090 --> 11:52.253
Diane is gonna marry Frasier
tomorrow in Florence.

11:52.423 --> 11:55.173
Sam, free at last!

11:55.341 --> 11:59.038
How about a little sensitivity?
He's broken up.

11:59.218 --> 12:03.675
lf Diane says she's in love with
Frasier and wants to marry him,

12:03.844 --> 12:06.334
l'm happy for her.
She got what she wanted.

12:06.511 --> 12:09.843
Maybe she called so you could
talk her out of marrying him.

12:10.012 --> 12:11.803
No, she wanted to gloat.

12:11.972 --> 12:15.633
She wanted you to tell her
you care for her.

12:15.807 --> 12:18.971
You bet.
So that she could laugh in my face.

12:19.141 --> 12:23.764
But l didn't fall for her little trick,
so l get to laugh in her face.

12:24.852 --> 12:27.257
Hear me? l'm laughing.

12:29.185 --> 12:32.554
- The man is a rock.
- From the neck up.

12:40.025 --> 12:44.020
Hello, Diane. l was just
ordering the chef's special.

12:48.903 --> 12:51.025
What took you so long?

12:52.405 --> 12:57.773
Frasier, l was overwhelmed.
l needed a little time to myself.

12:58.948 --> 13:02.031
Now l know what my answer
was all along.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.356
Yes, l'll marry you.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.020
Diane, you've made me so happy.

13:10.118 --> 13:12.406
Finally, something has gone right.

13:12.577 --> 13:14.817
- Tonight is perfect.
- Yes.

13:19.330 --> 13:24.403
l'm sorry, we tried to stay open
but the people in the kitchen can't go on.

13:27.415 --> 13:32.323
They're not taking Luigi's death
as well as l am.

13:37.628 --> 13:39.749
Please, accept our apologies.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.373
Here is the bill.

13:46.048 --> 13:48.038
The bill? For what?

13:49.423 --> 13:56.300
Sir, l'm not interested in squabbling
with you on this night.

13:57.303 --> 14:00.548
Here, are you satisfied?

14:02.888 --> 14:05.757
Go back to Pittsburgh, USA.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.924
Keep your money
for your cowboy boots and missiles.

14:14.891 --> 14:17.346
This place is overrated!

14:39.859 --> 14:41.732
l do.

14:50.655 --> 14:52.065
- Diane!
- l...

14:53.157 --> 14:55.774
Diane! Don't do this!

14:59.241 --> 15:02.940
What the hell...?
Excuse me, Father.

15:03.118 --> 15:05.986
Sam, what on earth are you doing here?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.780
Why are you marrying Frasier?

15:09.536 --> 15:11.327
- l love him, of course.
- No.

15:11.496 --> 15:16.202
No. Look me in the eye.
Now say that.

15:24.376 --> 15:26.699
l can't.

15:26.876 --> 15:30.158
You love me. Admit it.

15:30.334 --> 15:33.084
- Now, look here...
- l'm sorry, Frasier.

15:33.254 --> 15:35.460
Diane and l belong together.

15:37.212 --> 15:40.461
l know it's nuts,
but we both know it's true.

15:44.048 --> 15:46.291
You're right.

15:46.468 --> 15:51.041
l can't keep playing it safe, even
if l get hurt. l have to admit l love you.

15:51.219 --> 15:55.510
l've always loved you and l always will.

15:58.679 --> 16:03.588
- Frasier, will you forgive me?
- You know l will.

16:03.765 --> 16:06.929
l guess l knew
you two would end up together.

16:08.225 --> 16:12.007
- You're a good man, Frasier.
- l try.

16:12.728 --> 16:15.677
A dear, sweet, lovely man.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.885
Be happy, Diane.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.098
Well, Sam, l'm all yours.

16:35.859 --> 16:36.939
Come on.

16:37.111 --> 16:41.355
Let's go show Europe
what romance means.

16:43.863 --> 16:46.315
lt's not going to be like before.

16:46.489 --> 16:49.358
l'll make you happier
than you thought possible.

16:49.532 --> 16:52.317
l'll respect you and accept you,

16:52.490 --> 16:55.276
and l won't complain or argue
or be jealous.

16:55.452 --> 16:59.031
And l'll stop thinking
the life out of everything.

16:59.202 --> 17:03.697
l'll do all l can to make sure
you enjoy life to the fullest.

17:03.871 --> 17:06.656
lf that means letting you
date other women

17:06.828 --> 17:10.278
while l remain faithful to you, so be it.

17:10.454 --> 17:13.241
Your love is worth the price.

17:14.498 --> 17:17.249
l think this is gonna work this time.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.155
Sam!

17:25.963 --> 17:28.665
l'm sorry. My mind was somewhere else.

17:28.837 --> 17:34.621
lf we don't get some beers to this crowd,
they'll turn ugly.

17:34.798 --> 17:36.753
Too late!

17:38.259 --> 17:42.169
Does anyone know how long it takes
to get to ltaly from here?

17:42.344 --> 17:44.049
OK, nobody panic!

17:44.217 --> 17:49.459
You can make it from here to ltaly
in 8 hours, 37 minutes, 22 seconds.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.838
- With a good tail wind.
- Seriously?

17:53.013 --> 17:55.052
Unless you take the polar route.

17:55.221 --> 18:00.428
Then you run into those convex currents
created by the aurora borealis.

18:00.599 --> 18:03.847
You're a roaring bore-ealis.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.721
Get hold of yourself, Sam.
You're losing it.

18:06.893 --> 18:10.472
- You have a travel agent, don't you?
- Yeah. Cathy.

18:10.645 --> 18:14.721
Find out of l can get
onto a plane tonight to Florence.

18:14.897 --> 18:17.729
- Bingo.
- What are you doing?

18:17.897 --> 18:22.970
Can't you see this is a twisted cry
for help? Sammy, l'm here for you.

18:23.150 --> 18:27.689
Knock it off. l'm not saying l'm going.
l just wanna find out if l can.

18:27.859 --> 18:32.732
l don't get it, Sammy. Why Diane?
Why not arsenic or strychnine?

18:32.903 --> 18:37.064
Let's see if l'm following this.
Carla, you think Diane is bad for Sam.

18:37.238 --> 18:38.946
Oh, boy.

18:39.115 --> 18:42.276
This is the craziest thing
l've ever considered.

18:43.739 --> 18:46.441
You think l should go through with this?

18:46.616 --> 18:51.275
l think that you and Diane
are lovely, special people.

18:51.453 --> 18:55.697
Alone. Separately. lndividually.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.236
Together, frankly, you stink.

18:59.412 --> 19:01.533
To the casual observer,

19:01.706 --> 19:06.530
your running off to ltaly
would seem stupid beyond reason.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.458
- l'm going.
- That's what l'd do.

19:10.959 --> 19:14.739
She'll try to change you.
You can't be something you're not.

19:14.961 --> 19:18.906
You're a hound. You were born a hound.
You'll always be a hound.

19:19.087 --> 19:23.959
- You live for the hunt.
- People change. Hounds can change.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.753
Thank you, Cathy.

19:25.924 --> 19:29.751
There's a flight leaving in 45 minutes,
7 4 7, wide body,

19:29.923 --> 19:34.711
Flight 893, Captain Omar Wilkins.
Good man.

19:34.884 --> 19:38.382
Movie is ''Blame lt on Rio'',
edited for in-flight viewing,

19:38.553 --> 19:41.585
and l recommend the chicken Diablo.

19:44.261 --> 19:46.634
- Thank you.
- Roger, wilco.

19:48.637 --> 19:50.464
l'm out of here.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.888
Look at that pretty girl by the phone.

19:55.974 --> 19:58.725
- You looked. You know why?
- You told me to.

19:58.892 --> 20:02.340
l'm telling you not to go.
You're not listening to that.

20:02.519 --> 20:07.224
You looked because you're Sammy.
l don't wanna lose that guy.

20:07.396 --> 20:12.220
- l like him a lot.
- You're not gonna lose him. l promise.

20:12.397 --> 20:17.141
Listen, l gotta do this. lt's not for me.
lt's not for Diane.

20:17.316 --> 20:21.359
lt's for Frasier. Nobody deserves
to be married to that woman.

20:24.234 --> 20:27.103
l'm not saying
l'm gonna marry her. l just...

20:27.487 --> 20:30.355
l can't let her
make this kind of mistake.

20:32.322 --> 20:35.403
Sammy, liftoff's at 0-4-0 and counting.

20:36.863 --> 20:39.436
l'll call you from Florence.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.442
Talk about romantic.
lf l was a woman, l'd be crying.

20:45.618 --> 20:49.279
What would you do if you were a man?

21:00.083 --> 21:04.622
l suppose it's possible that Diane
will marry Frasier anyway.

21:04.791 --> 21:06.784
Not a chance, come on.

21:06.960 --> 21:12.163
No woman would turn down a man like
Sammy who crossed the ocean for her.

21:12.336 --> 21:17.671
Well, a toast to Sammy,
somewhere high over the Atlantic.

21:18.212 --> 21:20.251
Or, if he's lucky, in it.

21:28.757 --> 21:30.630
The operator's connecting me.

21:30.799 --> 21:36.301
Even if you get your mother,
she won't be in time for the wedding.

21:36.470 --> 21:41.544
- She'd have to be in the air already.
- l want to tell her we're getting married.

21:41.720 --> 21:48.338
Look at that peasant woman by the tree.
Wouldn't that make a beautiful picture?

21:48.515 --> 21:50.888
The essence of ltaly.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.133
Give your mother my love.

21:56.645 --> 22:01.136
Please, Sam, for once in your life,
have done the right thing.

22:01.312 --> 22:04.560
Don't be at Cheers. Be on a plane.

22:04.731 --> 22:08.976
No, as far as l know,
Paul Revere never went to Florida.

22:10.275 --> 22:12.098
But...

22:12.274 --> 22:13.767
Let me get it.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.357
lt's Sam's private line.
The machine will pick up.

22:21.111 --> 22:23.565
Hi, this is Sam Malone.

22:30.531 --> 22:34.360
Frasier, l've been thinking.

22:34.532 --> 22:37.532
We're so far from Florence
and we're having car trouble.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.987
Fate is telling us something.

22:40.159 --> 22:44.784
Why not just get married here
in this little town, right now?

22:44.954 --> 22:48.284
- Wouldn't that be romantic?
- Diane, l love that idea.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.740
- Let's do it.
- l love you.

23:00.457 --> 23:02.866
Are you cold, sir?

23:03.042 --> 23:07.202
No. No, l'm not.
l just had a chill, l guess.

23:07.376 --> 23:11.325
- lf there's anything l can do...
- l'm fine.

23:11.545 --> 23:16.040
But don't go too far away.
l think l may need some assistance.
