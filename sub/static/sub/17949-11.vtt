00:13.081 --> 00:14.082
both: WHY?

00:14.082 --> 00:15.449

00:15.449 --> 00:17.751
EVER SINCE HE RESCUED AND
STARTED DATING BLONDE JENNIFER,

00:17.751 --> 00:21.355
HE SEEMS DIFFERENT.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.992
THREE SMOOTHIES
AND ONE CORN DOG.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.894
- I DON'T EAT CORN DOGS ANYMORE,
GUYS.

00:26.894 --> 00:30.164
JENNIFER SAYS THEY MAKE
MY BREATH SMELL LIKE CORN DOGS.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.740
- OKAY, WHERE'S CARLOS?

00:39.740 --> 00:41.242

[bell dings]

00:42.310 --> 00:43.611

00:43.611 --> 00:47.381
JENNIFER WANTS TO GO BIKING.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.982
[bell dings]

00:51.252 --> 00:53.053
- WELL...

00:53.053 --> 00:55.089
THERE'S ONE THING
THAT'LL NEVER CHANGE:

00:55.089 --> 00:57.057
CARLOS' LOVE OF GOALTENDING.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.978
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE

HE'S PROBABLY PUTTING ON

02:26.580 --> 02:27.848
A NEW SHOULDER SWEATER

02:27.848 --> 02:29.217
SO JENNIFER CAN PULL HIM AROUND
ON HER LEASH.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.819
- GUYS, IT IS
HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.255
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE HIM
A BREAK.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.294
OKAY, BREAK OVER.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.763
- I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE
THE DOGGIE-DOPTION.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.997
JENNIFER DOESN'T LIKE DOG HAIR,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.834
AND I MIGHT GET SOME
ON MY SWEATER.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.636
- UH, WE'RE FINDING DOGS HOMES.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.504
- THERE'S GONNA BE PUPPIES
THERE.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.240
- PUPPIES?

02:52.240 --> 02:55.809
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GOING.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.345
- CARLOS.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.414
COME WITH ME TO THE POOL IN CASE
I NEED YOU TO DO THINGS FOR ME.

03:00.414 --> 03:04.084

03:28.776 --> 03:30.177
WE STILL NEED THE HARD DRIVES

03:30.177 --> 03:32.145
AND FOR YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT THE VIDEO IS.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.816
- THE VIDEO IS ABOUT HAVING
THE TIME OF OUR LIFE.

03:35.816 --> 03:39.587
AND THE REST OF IT IS
A-PERCOLATING IN MY HEAD.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.422
NOW, I AM OFF TO GO GET
THE HARD DRIVES FOR THE CAMERA.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.156
- OR I CAN GRAB THEM FOR YOU

03:43.156 --> 03:44.425
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME THE PASSWORD

03:44.425 --> 03:46.327
TO YOUR NEW SECRET
SECURITY CLOSET.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.462

03:48.462 --> 03:53.000
NOW GO OUT THERE AND GET SOME
AWESOME STUFF FOR MY VIDEO.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.368

03:54.368 --> 03:56.136
- UH, NO.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.038
- GREAT.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.649
[door rattling]

04:16.156 --> 04:18.559
- HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT
MY SECRET SECURITY CLOSET?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.528
AND HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

04:20.528 --> 04:22.330
- I'M AN EXPLORER BY NATURE,

04:22.330 --> 04:25.198
AND YOU LEFT THE DOOR OPEN.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.736
- YEAH, WELL, NOW THE DOOR IS...

04:28.736 --> 04:29.737
SHUT.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.204
HA!

04:31.204 --> 04:34.708
- YOU HAVE JUST LOCKED YOURSELF
IN THE SUPER SECURITY CLOSET.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.510
- WHAT?
WHA-WAIT. WHAT?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.979
OKAY, CALM DOWN,
BECAUSE I PAID EXTRA

04:38.979 --> 04:42.750
FOR THE VOICE-ACTIVATED PASSWORD
SYSTEM THAT OPENS THE DOOR.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.686
AND THE PASSWORD IS...

04:45.686 --> 04:47.755
- YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR PASSWORD.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.359
- BUT THE PASSWORD HINT IS...

04:51.359 --> 04:54.728
SOMETHING I LOVE.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.564
- YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
YOUR PASSWORD.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.831
- I'M THINKING!

04:57.831 --> 04:59.232
- CANNONBALL!

04:59.232 --> 05:02.370
- CARLOS.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.637
NO CANNONBALLS.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.905
THEY'RE MESSY.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.607
- BUT I LOVE CANNONBALLS.

05:08.476 --> 05:12.380
I HATE CANNONBALLS.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.981
- HEY.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.516
- SHE TOOK AWAY HIS CANNONBALLS.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.550
- WHAT?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.519
- HE LOVES CANNONBALLS.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.388
THEN JENNIFER DID THIS THING
WITH HER FINGER,

05:20.388 --> 05:23.123
AND HE GAVE THEM UP
LIKE HE WAS UNDER A SPELL.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.559
- THAT SEEMS A LITTLE
FARFETCHED.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.794
- NOT IF SHE'S A WITCH.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.033
- THEIR RELATIONSHIP DOES SEEM
A LITTLE ONE-SIDED,

05:33.033 --> 05:36.770
BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A
PERFECT RELATIONSHIP LIKE OURS.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.805
- RIGHT.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.407
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO SHOW
CARLOS

05:39.407 --> 05:40.808
WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP
IS LIKE

05:40.808 --> 05:42.710
SO WE CAN BREAK HER TEEN WITCH
SPELL.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.878
- YEAH.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.614
NO.

05:46.614 --> 05:49.016
EVERY TIME WE DO THINGS
LIKE THAT, WE END UP FIGHTING.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.419
- WE NEED TO SHOW CARLOS WHAT
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE!

05:51.419 --> 05:54.054
- IF I GET HURT,
YOU'RE WEARING A PINK SWEATER!

05:54.054 --> 05:55.423
- HERE YOU GO.
THANKS FOR COMING.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.757

05:56.757 --> 05:57.925

05:57.925 --> 05:59.226
- BYE, GUYS.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.994

06:00.994 --> 06:03.831
THANKS TO YOUR HELP, WE FOUND
HOMES FOR ALL BUT EIGHT DOGS.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.700
- AND WE'LL FIND HOMES
FOR THE REST OF THEM NEXT TIME.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.936
- UNFORTUNATELY
THERE IS NO NEXT TIME.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.504
THIS WAS THEIR LAST CHANCE,

06:10.504 --> 06:13.441
SO THESE GUYS ARE GOING
TO THE DOGHOUSE IN THE SKY.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.909
- OH, LIKE A POOCH PENTHOUSE.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.446
- NO, SHE MEANS...

06:18.446 --> 06:19.580

06:19.580 --> 06:21.014
WE NEED TO FIND HOMES
FOR THESE DOGS.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.450
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

06:22.450 --> 06:26.253
- OKAY, WELL, THE FAIR'S OVER,
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.155
[dogs barking]

06:28.155 --> 06:31.692
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.527
AND WHAT IS MRS. KNIGHT
GONNA SAY?

06:35.663 --> 06:37.598

06:42.202 --> 06:43.303
- SHE SAID SHE'S OKAY WITH IT.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.205

06:45.205 --> 06:47.107
- NO BARS.
NO BARS.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.776
NO BARS!

06:48.776 --> 06:50.143
I CAN'T BE TRAPPED IN HERE!

06:50.143 --> 06:51.344
I GOT TO THINK OF A VIDEO,

06:51.344 --> 06:54.582

06:54.582 --> 06:55.749

ARE TRYING TO BREAK US UP.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.871
- WE WEREN'T.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.840
BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.442
SHE MADE YOU GIVE UP CORN DOGS
AND HOCKEY,

10:09.442 --> 10:12.880
AND SHE MAYBE PUT A SPELL
ON YOU, SO...

10:12.880 --> 10:14.915
- WELL, I DO MISS CORN DOGS,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.217

10:17.217 --> 10:18.551
- IT'S TERRIBLE.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.654

10:32.165 --> 10:34.267
- HEY, SO WHAT'S THE PLAN NOW?

10:34.267 --> 10:38.338
- THE PLAN IS, THIS RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT WORKING OUT.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.140
IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S ME.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.442
AND I NEED SOME SPACE,
SO WE'RE BREAKING UP.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.045
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.046
- SEE?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.414
KEEP IT SHORT,
SIMPLE,

10:47.414 --> 10:51.785

CORN DOGS IN NO TIME.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.421

11:11.739 --> 11:13.473
TRYING TO RUIN
OUR PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.243
IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK,
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

11:16.243 --> 11:20.814
IT'S EITHER BIG TIME RUSH
OR ME.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.583
OH, AND, CARLOS,
BEFORE YOU DECIDE...

11:28.822 --> 11:30.657

11:54.982 --> 11:56.784
SHE DOES THIS WITH HER FINGER,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
THEN THEY GO KISS.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.619
SHE'S NOT A WITCH.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.355
SHE'S JUST A REALLY GOOD KISSER.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.824
- YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.092
- WHAT?

12:05.092 --> 12:07.294
NO, YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK
I WAS SERI--

12:07.294 --> 12:08.661
OH.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.163
