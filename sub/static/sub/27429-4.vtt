00:00.368 --> 00:01.700
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.736 --> 00:03.602
This is Mariana Adams Foster.

00:03.637 --> 00:06.572
- For real? You're an engineer?
- Yes.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.474
We'll get you started
on some data entry.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.753
I was hired to develop software.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.611
I'm team leader. I assign the
work and the time that it takes.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.558
I've been trying not to say
"I'm sorry" as a feminist.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.460
- Is it someone's birthday?
- My best friend, Sumi.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.628
- I thought that was your girlfriend.
- We're engaged!

00:18.652 --> 00:20.552
I want you to be my maid-of-honor.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.621
I just happen to be
still in love with her.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.290
This is Rebecca, this
is Ben. Fellow clerks.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.636
You're angry that the judge gave me

00:26.660 --> 00:27.660
the Jamal Thompson case.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.362
I don't allow empathy
to distort my judgment,

00:30.398 --> 00:32.331
and I have no use for clerks who do.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.466
You told your friends I'm
clerking the Jamal case?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.868
Was I not supposed to?

00:35.903 --> 00:37.614
No one's supposed to know
what cases I'm working on.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.506
I could get fired!

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:03.364 --> 01:04.596
- Mariana...
- Sorry.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.453
Good night!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.455
- Mariana!
- Sorry.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.561
So, on a scale of one to ten,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.296
how deep is the shit we're in?

01:37.331 --> 01:39.731
A shit-ten. Get it? Like shit-ton?

01:41.802 --> 01:43.535
You sure you can handle another?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.637
I can drink any Harvard
grad under the table.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.506
We'll see about that.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.585
We knew how to party at Yale.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.776
Harvardians are notoriously boring.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.312
You'll always be ranked
number two to our number one.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.414
Have you ever seen the
judge that angry before?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.815
- No.
- Nope.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.417
Could you imagine being his kid?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.586
Probably a reason they're
both studying abroad.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.554
His son's not.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.256
How do you know?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.492
The judge said he's
doing a semester at sea.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.594
Well, he's not. I met him.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.362
- What?
- When?

02:17.404 --> 02:19.571
That was... awkward.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.672
You think?

02:20.708 --> 02:23.142
- You didn't have to rub it in.
- Me?

02:23.177 --> 02:25.344
Wait a minute. I forgot my phone.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.623
You need to get a grip on that thing.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.514
You don't want to miss
another important call.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.681
We'll wait for you out here.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.483
Maybe down the street.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.485
Yeah! Yeah, that's true...

02:44.765 --> 02:47.533
Sorry, I left my phone in the bathroom.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.434
Come in.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.515
We still have company.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.417
Sorry, I thought they were gone.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.748
What about Justice John Marshall Harlan?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.617
The "Great Dissenter?"

03:38.652 --> 03:41.520
You realize he argued against
segregation for blacks,

03:41.555 --> 03:44.289
but agreed that Chinese
were so different from whites

03:44.325 --> 03:45.569
that they couldn't become U.S. citizens.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.526
So, not so great.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.772
Guess they didn't
teach you that at Yale.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.729
What about a case like
Gideon v. Wainwright ?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.297
Too easy.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.665
Harlan's not easy?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.434
How about Lieutenant Watada?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.502
He refused to deploy to Iraq in 2006,

03:57.538 --> 03:58.748
'cause he thought the war was illegal.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.373
Interesting how someone with
no political convictions,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.308
chooses Watada, who stood up for his.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.688
My political conviction is to get Wilson

04:04.712 --> 04:07.546
to feed me to an appellate
judge and then the Supreme Court.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.281
So you can change the world?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.450
So I can write my ticket

04:11.485 --> 04:13.585
to any law firm in the
country and get rich.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.688
- Of course.
- Some of us weren't born with a trust fund.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.523
How do you know I have a trust fund?

04:18.559 --> 04:19.625
You don't?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.729
What about Jamal Thompson?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.364
You don't have to keep reminding us

04:25.399 --> 04:27.432
you got the case we all wanted.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.746
I wasn't. Sometimes the
last thing you think of

04:29.770 --> 04:31.570
is the thing that's
right in front of you.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.739
All right, I will see you
all tomorrow at my house.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.307
I'm gonna barbecue.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.609
Oh, and, uh, just so you know,

04:38.280 --> 04:41.458
I've never been stumped, but don't
let that stop you from trying.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.582
Remember, case or legal figure.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.664
We're at holiday, and
we have to spend it

04:47.688 --> 04:50.455
at his house playing twenty questions.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.658
Speaking of questions,
I have one for Callie.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.406
Remember that girl who
entered the courtroom late?

04:56.430 --> 04:59.298
The one Jamal's mother waved
over to sit next to her?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.434
Do you know her?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.476
Why would you think I know her?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.545
It's just the way you
were looking at her.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.216
I saw her...

05:17.251 --> 05:18.483
on the courthouse steps...

05:18.519 --> 05:19.551
protesting.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.221
So, yeah, I recognized her.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.455
But you don't know her.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.591
Asked and answered.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.192
All right.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.635
All of my friends from home are married,

05:36.670 --> 05:40.239
and a few are even the
good kind of pregnant.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.506
On purpose.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.376
I just don't know what I'm doing here.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.478
I never even wanted to be a teacher.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.713
Then why are you?

05:47.748 --> 05:50.449
Because Teach for America
helps pay your student loans,

05:50.484 --> 05:52.295
and I thought it would
give me time to figure out

05:52.319 --> 05:55.354
what the hell I want to
do. I still have no clue.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.222
Maybe I should have stayed in Fitchburg,

05:57.258 --> 05:59.591
maybe I'd be married and
have a house and a yard.

05:59.627 --> 06:03.295
Oh, so Jeff's in town.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.598
- Who's Jeff?
- A friend from high school.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.234
- A friend with benefits.
- Okay.

06:09.270 --> 06:10.580
And she only talks about moving home

06:10.604 --> 06:12.571
when he's visiting, so...

06:12.606 --> 06:14.439
Yes, he's in town.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.508
In fact, I have to run.
We're getting drinks.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.144
Well, have him join us.
I want to meet this guy.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.212
Yeah, me too.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.581
He's very... corn-fed.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.450
I love corn!

06:25.486 --> 06:27.486
Don't worry. We'll be nice.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.321
Okay...

06:30.457 --> 06:34.192
Oh, I ordered us Veuve, on me.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.328
Okay, Champagne Mami , I see you!

06:37.431 --> 06:41.333
- Thank you.
- While I may hate working at Speckulate,

06:41.368 --> 06:43.268
I do love those fat paychecks.

06:43.304 --> 06:44.469
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

06:44.505 --> 06:47.239
Uh, Mariana, could you
respond to the group chat

06:47.274 --> 06:48.318
about the Digital Planet account?

06:48.342 --> 06:50.242
Oh, yeah, sorry. Doing that now.

06:55.150 --> 06:57.380
_

07:06.460 --> 07:09.127
- Jeez!
- Very funny, Alex!

07:09.163 --> 07:11.330
Wow, Mariana, I don't
think I have to tell you

07:11.365 --> 07:13.565
this is very inappropriate
workplace behavior.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.500
You know, I could take this to H.R.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.580
Oh, so could I. This could be
considered sexual harassment.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.605
Raj, do you feel harassed?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.441
Yeah, a little.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.276
I'm just curious: why my boy, Raj?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.311
Hmm?

07:25.346 --> 07:27.412
Because he's the most eligible bachelor

07:27.448 --> 07:29.448
- from Pakistan?
- Dude, I'm Indian.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.184
Would you like to charm his snake?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.186
You think you're being funny?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.253
Talk about harassment.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.290
Come on, Raj knows I'm
kidding, right, Raj?

07:39.493 --> 07:40.493
It's fine.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.428
This snake can't be tamed!

07:43.464 --> 07:45.397
There it is.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.632
See, not everybody's so sensitive.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.234
If you wanna be part of the team,

07:49.269 --> 07:50.869
you gotta learn to take a joke, Mariana.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.507
So we can add racist on top of sexist

07:55.542 --> 07:57.376
and overall douchiness.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.178
- Ugh.
- At least you're making bank, girl.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.246
I'm hardly getting by.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.383
So where's your sister tonight?

08:04.418 --> 08:06.585
Don't you mean, where's Gael tonight?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.553
No, and I know where he is.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.355
- Mmm.
- He went to see his parents.

08:10.391 --> 08:11.568
Okay, well, don't put her in the middle.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.126
Don't worry. I'm Sweden.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.128
Yeah, I think you mean Switzerland.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.597
Well, she's working as always.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.465
Not always...

08:20.501 --> 08:22.200
Hey there, beautiful.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.236
Hi!

08:28.342 --> 08:30.153
So my brother's gonna be my "best man,"

08:30.177 --> 08:31.354
and then we're gonna share bridesmaids.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.412
I want a big traditional wedding.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.280
Anything Baby wants...

08:35.315 --> 08:36.315
Aww...

08:38.318 --> 08:40.552
Oh, Alice, what are those
flowers you always get me?

08:40.587 --> 08:42.530
- he ones I love so much?
- Peonies.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.943
I want those. Oh, and there's
this wedding planning site

08:44.944 --> 08:47.392
called ITheeWed. biz, which is
supposed to be really helpful.

08:47.428 --> 08:48.571
Okay, yeah, I'll check it out.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.639
There's a registration fee.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.329
I'll Venmo you.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.532
Don't worry. I got it.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.021
So we are trying to figure
out where to get married.

08:57.022 --> 08:59.204
- What do you think?
- How about you get married

08:59.239 --> 09:02.107
up your stupid little ass, you bitch?

09:03.177 --> 09:06.478
- What do you think?
- Maybe a beach wedding might be nice.

09:06.513 --> 09:10.248
Or we could get married
here on the roof.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.184
I mean, it's beautiful at sunset.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.586
And we could have, like,
gardenias floating in the pool.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.488
- Hey, babe, we gotta go.
- Oh, great, okay.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.427
- Love you!
- Love you, too.

09:28.202 --> 09:31.269
- Don't even say it.
- Why are you doing this?

09:31.305 --> 09:33.238
It's like exposure therapy, okay?

09:33.273 --> 09:34.517
If I help her plan this wedding,

09:34.541 --> 09:36.586
then I'll be numb to the fact
that she's not marrying me.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.543
And if she's a total bridezilla,

09:38.579 --> 09:41.213
maybe I'll even end up hating her.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.450
Hey, Alice, the WI-FI's
still real spotty in my loft.

09:45.486 --> 09:48.453
I just had this guy install
this extender last week.

09:48.489 --> 09:50.589
Yeah, well, the signal still sucks.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.290
So, look, I think it's only fair

09:52.326 --> 09:54.370
that I don't pay my part of
the internet bill anymore.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.194
Okay.

09:56.230 --> 09:59.197
Yeah, that, um, sounds
reasonable, I guess.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.298
Perf.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.894
Oh, um, we're out of toilet paper, too.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.369
I'll take care of it.

10:08.342 --> 10:11.309
Okay, so I drew a penis and balls

10:11.345 --> 10:13.211
with sharpie on the white board.

10:13.247 --> 10:15.247
And then with a dry-erase pen,

10:15.282 --> 10:18.350
I drew a tail and floppy ears,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.485
eyes, whiskers so it looked like a dog.

10:20.521 --> 10:23.188
And when Mrs. Hillebrand
went to wipe it off...

10:23.223 --> 10:24.489
Only the penis was left.

10:24.525 --> 10:27.325
The look on her face was priceless.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.594
You can't complain about
being a teacher ever again.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.531
Yeah, karma's a bitch.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.400
- Oh, that's weird.
- What?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.235
My house alarm just went off.

10:37.271 --> 10:38.581
Probably nothing, it's
probably just the dog.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.638
I'll be right back.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.273
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.442
So, he's fantastic.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.511
And so into you.

10:46.547 --> 10:49.548
Are you sure this is just
friends with benefits?

10:49.583 --> 10:51.283
Ohhh, maybe more.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.264
Okay, well, I have to pee.

10:54.288 --> 10:56.522
- Order another round on me.
- Absolutely!

10:59.293 --> 11:01.271
Yeah, if it was the motion
sensor in the living room,

11:01.295 --> 11:02.594
it was probably the dog.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.262
No, I'm actually out of town right now.

11:04.298 --> 11:05.497
Did you try my wife?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.434
Okay, you should have
her cell phone on record.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.203
Okay, thanks.

11:40.349 --> 11:42.449
_

11:45.455 --> 11:47.289
Is this gonna be, like, a nightly thing?

11:49.359 --> 11:52.327
- What?
- Going out? Drinking?

11:52.362 --> 11:54.095
It's not like I have a demanding job.

11:54.131 --> 11:58.233
Also, I heard you went out
with Jamie the other night.

11:58.268 --> 11:59.367
Thanks for sharing.

11:59.403 --> 12:00.836
Who told you that?

12:01.271 --> 12:03.305
Bryan.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.273
He said he and Gael saw you out.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.419
Was that, like, totally awkward?

12:06.443 --> 12:09.077
Why is Bryan talking to you about me?

12:09.112 --> 12:12.113
I don't know, I guess he's
just curious about you and Gael,

12:12.149 --> 12:14.316
but I told him I'm Sweden.

12:14.351 --> 12:16.184
Oh, wait... Switzerland?

12:18.221 --> 12:19.321
Where are you going now?

12:19.356 --> 12:21.089
Getting dressed for work

12:21.124 --> 12:23.224
so I can just roll out
of bed in the morning.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.260
It's not like you to
just give up on your job.

12:26.363 --> 12:28.463
I'm not, I'm biding time.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.166
Being patient, blah blah blah...

12:32.469 --> 12:34.402
Oh, I need your advice on something.

12:34.438 --> 12:35.470
Like you'll take it.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.072
I take your advice.

12:38.141 --> 12:39.474
Occasionally.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.109
Anyway...

12:41.144 --> 12:43.545
Davia's been hooking up with
this guy from her hometown

12:43.580 --> 12:45.313
when he's in L.A. on business,

12:45.349 --> 12:48.550
and I overheard him on the
phone talking about his wife.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.352
He's married!

12:50.420 --> 12:53.355
And Davia's talking about
how she's falling for him

12:53.390 --> 12:55.256
and how she wants to
move home to Wisconsin.

12:55.292 --> 12:57.493
- Should I tell her?
- No.

12:58.562 --> 13:01.162
It's always the messenger who gets shot.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.032
Just... stay out of it.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.067
Seriously.

13:06.503 --> 13:07.503
Mariana?

13:13.143 --> 13:14.509
Mariana!

13:14.544 --> 13:16.211
Can you come with me, please?

13:16.246 --> 13:18.213
Uh, yeah...

13:26.556 --> 13:28.156
Am I in trouble?

13:28.191 --> 13:29.191
Oh, no no...

13:29.226 --> 13:30.403
We'd like you to be in the photo

13:30.427 --> 13:32.260
for our new career page,

13:32.295 --> 13:33.395
highlighting our engineers.

13:33.430 --> 13:37.265
Well, I've only been working
here for a couple weeks.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.168
No worries, we want to show
our fresh new faces, too.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.242
We've worked hard at Speckulate

13:47.277 --> 13:49.544
to nurture a diverse
and inclusive workplace,

13:49.579 --> 13:53.515
where everyone has equal
opportunity to participate and rise

13:53.550 --> 13:57.419
in a safe and supportive environment.

13:57.454 --> 13:59.087
I think you'd fit in great.

13:59.122 --> 14:01.222
Wow, that sounds amazing.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.324
When do I start?

14:03.360 --> 14:05.493
Now, uh, if you'll
just jump on in there...

14:08.231 --> 14:09.297
Then later this afternoon,

14:09.332 --> 14:12.367
we'll do the on camera
interviews for digital.

14:12.402 --> 14:14.269
Wait, uh, interviews for what?

14:14.304 --> 14:15.504
Just how great the culture is.

14:15.539 --> 14:17.138
You know, that kind of thing.

14:18.375 --> 14:19.419
The culture sucks!

14:19.443 --> 14:22.444
So does this so-called "diversity."

14:22.479 --> 14:25.213
Most of our engineering
staff are white guys,

14:25.248 --> 14:27.415
but who do they cherry-pick
to put on the jobs page?

14:27.451 --> 14:29.451
The handful of women
and people of color.

14:29.486 --> 14:32.187
So what else is new?

14:32.222 --> 14:35.490
Every company, every school
tries to advertise as "diverse."

14:35.525 --> 14:37.225
Doesn't it bother you?

14:37.260 --> 14:38.500
Does it bother me that

14:38.528 --> 14:40.462
eighty percent of tech execs are white

14:40.497 --> 14:42.397
and fifteen percent
of engineers are women?

14:42.432 --> 14:44.232
Um, yeah!

14:44.267 --> 14:45.300
Well, you know what?

14:45.335 --> 14:47.402
I got sold a bill of
goods in my interview,

14:47.437 --> 14:49.237
and I'm not gonna help perpetuate a lie

14:49.272 --> 14:52.073
that this is a female-friendly,
diverse workplace.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.541
Okay, so, what are you gonna do?

14:55.412 --> 14:56.444
Tell it like it is.

14:58.548 --> 15:02.283
- Do you know Claudia in engineering?
- No.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.319
I'll tell you why...

15:03.353 --> 15:06.020
She told it like it is

15:06.056 --> 15:08.423
and suddenly left to
seek other opportunities.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.191
And her male colleague?

15:10.227 --> 15:12.227
Yeah, he got promoted.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.363
Am I frustrated that I
have to work twice as hard

15:15.398 --> 15:17.332
to get half as far as white men?

15:17.367 --> 15:22.170
Hell yeah! But blowing up your career

15:22.205 --> 15:25.039
is not gonna change the
culture around here, Mariana.

15:25.075 --> 15:28.209
You can vent to me anytime,

15:28.245 --> 15:30.144
but I would hat for us to lose

15:30.180 --> 15:32.080
another talented Latina engineer.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.417
See you in a bit.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.525
So great to finally meet you, Callie.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.293
Rebecca and Ben just arrived.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.209
Hey, are you guys
bringing anything tomorrow?

15:50.233 --> 15:51.366
- I'm not.
- Me either.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.503
Oh, these flowers are
gorgeous, Ben, thank you!

15:55.539 --> 15:57.238
And Rebecca, I can't wait to open

15:57.274 --> 15:59.274
this lovely bottle of ChÃ¢teau Margaux.

15:59.309 --> 16:00.375
Welcome!

16:00.410 --> 16:02.321
Well, I hope you're
hungry. I'm grilling steaks.

16:02.345 --> 16:04.312
I'm so happy to finally meet you all.

16:04.347 --> 16:07.348
I always insist that he invite
his new clerks to the house,

16:07.384 --> 16:09.117
but we've been so busy.

16:09.152 --> 16:12.120
I'm curious to learn what you've
chosen to try to stump me with.

16:12.155 --> 16:14.422
Now Curtis, don't talk
shop the whole time.

16:14.457 --> 16:17.191
In this house, I'm the judge and jury.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.094
Your honor, permission
to approach the bench?

16:20.130 --> 16:21.130
Proceed.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.967
I'm gonna go put these
flowers in some water.

16:27.304 --> 16:31.072
Well, I think I have chosen
a very challenging case

16:31.107 --> 16:33.441
or legal figure for you three to guess.

16:33.476 --> 16:35.109
Uh, we're playing, too?

16:35.145 --> 16:37.245
Of course! And I've added a twist.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.214
Whomever guesses first,
if anyone guesses at all,

16:40.250 --> 16:43.518
gets to steal a case of their
choice from another clerk.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.459
So, how do you like your steaks cooked?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.861
- I've been thinking...
- Mm-hmm?

17:09.896 --> 17:12.896
... about maybe moving back home.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.967
Be closer to my family, closer to you.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.905
I love my kids, they're
bright and they want to learn,

17:20.940 --> 17:23.741
but my classroom's too big.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.810
Each kid's at a different level.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.880
They only gave me six weeks
of training before I started.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.615
They deserve a real teacher.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.650
They're lucky to have
a teacher who cares.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.554
It's hard not to care too much.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.724
They don't have the
resources they deserve.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.860
Without support, I see why
teachers burn out, you know?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.763
What would you do back home?

17:45.799 --> 17:48.866
Hmmm, get a less stressful job,

17:48.902 --> 17:50.935
like a bomb defuser.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.706
Ooooo.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.641
We could see more of each other.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.910
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that something you want?

18:00.046 --> 18:02.647
It's something that I'd very much want.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.030
So Ben, where are you from?

18:08.054 --> 18:09.821
Denver, born and raised.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.724
- You must be a Broncos fan.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.926
So how do you feel about
the NFL fining players

18:14.961 --> 18:16.794
who kneel during the anthem?

18:16.830 --> 18:18.930
I think a private employer has the right

18:18.965 --> 18:21.799
to set standards of conduct
and enact reprisals if need be.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.046
I don't find it appropriate
that they disrespect the anthem

18:24.070 --> 18:26.671
when there are other methods
to getting their point across.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.773
I think the NFL is
right in punishing them.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.808
Sounds like the senator
from Texas speaking.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.579
Do you ever break ranks
with your grandfather?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.758
Not if I want to stay in the will.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.016
Fair enough... Callie?

18:39.052 --> 18:41.986
I think it's a clear violation
of the First Amendment.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.956
I'm so tired of liberals
misinterpreting the First Amendment.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.925
As opposed to conservatives
using it to allow corporations

18:47.961 --> 18:49.594
to buy off political candidates

18:49.629 --> 18:50.873
and discriminate against gay people?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.030
Technically, freedom of
speech only protects citizens

18:53.066 --> 18:54.632
from government censorship.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.968
When the President of the
United States is pressuring

18:57.003 --> 18:59.570
a private employer to adopt
a punitive workplace rule,

18:59.606 --> 19:01.572
that is government censorship.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.842
Not to mention the NFL changed
their terms of employment

19:04.878 --> 19:06.811
without consulting the players' union,

19:06.846 --> 19:08.846
which is a violation of
good-faith bargaining,

19:08.882 --> 19:10.882
and against the law.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.618
- That's a stretch.
- Yeah, agreed.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.920
- I disagree.
- See? Ha.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.000
I don't like the kneeling
during our national anthem,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.757
but Callie makes a compelling argument

19:19.793 --> 19:22.627
for why this expressive
conduct should be protected.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.042
So what do you all do for fun?

19:27.066 --> 19:29.044
Your husband doesn't give
us much time to have fun.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.602
I sing in a quartet.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.971
Oh, that's interesting!

19:34.007 --> 19:37.041
- Callie?
- When I have spare time, I usually spend it

19:37.076 --> 19:39.777
having casual sex with
a guy in my building.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.681
I like photography and art.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.716
Nice.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.017
What about you and the judge?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.953
We play golf, see friends...

19:48.988 --> 19:51.622
Yeah, with the kids away at college,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.859
it's nice to have her to myself.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.661
What colleges do your kids go to?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.796
Oh, they both are studying
abroad at the moment.

19:58.832 --> 20:01.599
Allison's at Smith, but
she's doing a year in France.

20:01.634 --> 20:06.037
And Tate's at Berkeley, but
he's doing a semester at sea.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.773
Oh, Berkeley, that's a
pretty liberal university.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.008
Mmm, so was Stanford,
but I came out okay.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.047
So? Are we ready to play the game?

20:16.082 --> 20:17.082
Hmm?

20:19.786 --> 20:20.786
Who wants to go first?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.620
I'll go.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.922
- Is it a legal character?
- No.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.057
So it's a legal case.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.758
Was it heard by the Supreme Court?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.794
- Yes.
- Was it a split 5-4 decision?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.796
- Yes.
- Was it politically controversial?

20:31.831 --> 20:32.831
Yes!

20:32.866 --> 20:33.965
Is it Bush v. Gore ?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.002
Are you a mind reader?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.743
Wait, so we never needed that extender?

20:45.778 --> 20:46.978
No, you need a new router.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.880
Can I at least return the extender?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.882
It's a refurbished one, so no.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.818
Well, we can't afford
a new router right now.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.986
Okay, then...

20:55.021 --> 20:56.888
Service call's ninety bucks.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.689
You misdiagnosed the problem last time.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.969
Why should I have to
pay another service call?

20:59.993 --> 21:01.826
Because I got a wife with cancer,

21:01.861 --> 21:03.060
a child with a disability,

21:03.096 --> 21:05.596
- and a dog with...
- Okay, okay, okay, just...

21:05.632 --> 21:06.697
Jeez!

21:06.733 --> 21:07.932
I'm sorry.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.901
Wow, sorry.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.881
Let me know if you want me
to install that new router.

21:11.905 --> 21:14.071
Can I just ask, is that
gonna be another service call?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.606
Well, yeah.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.745
Did he pimp our WI-FI?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.847
No, I wish. The Coterie's
out of money this month.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.882
Oh, hey Alice, we're
out of toilet paper.

21:24.918 --> 21:26.095
I just bought more this morning.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.818
But if the Coterie's out of money,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.720
how are you paying for
all this toilet paper?

21:29.756 --> 21:30.955
Don't worry about it, okay?

21:30.990 --> 21:32.034
It's... I've got it covered.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.624
Out of pocket?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.760
Look, I made a commitment
to serve this community.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.628
And as ridiculous as it may sound,

21:37.664 --> 21:39.108
that includes providing
free toilet paper, okay?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.933
For everyone, okay? For you, for me...

21:41.968 --> 21:43.868
Just... people rely on me,

21:43.903 --> 21:45.970
and I'm not gonna... I'm
not gonna let them down.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.705
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.740
Let go.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.751
You want to pray about it?

21:56.015 --> 21:57.848
So I guessed it. Bush v. Gore .

22:01.688 --> 22:03.087
No!

22:03.122 --> 22:06.624
No, do you really think that I
would choose such an obvious case?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.596
- Was this a 21st century case?
- Yes.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.598
- Was Justice Scalia on the court?
- Yes.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.700
- Did Scalia write the dissenting opinion?
- No.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.680
Was the petitioner an
individual or a corporation?

22:17.704 --> 22:18.769
Yes or no questions only.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.038
- Individual?
- I'm sorry, you lost your turn.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.740
Was the petitioner an individual?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.041
Yes, multiple individuals.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.921
Can we take a time out? I
need to use the restroom.

22:25.945 --> 22:26.945
Hand over your phone.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.679
You calling me a cheater?

22:28.715 --> 22:29.758
I'm not calling you a saint.

22:29.782 --> 22:33.618
How about we just finish
the game after dessert?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.686
Let's make some room.

22:41.728 --> 22:45.029
So listen, the case
is  Glossip v. Gross.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.634
I hate it when Curtis pits
his clerks against each other,

22:49.669 --> 22:51.636
and I like you best, so...

22:51.671 --> 22:53.671
Just wrap it up and put an end to this.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.779
Oh, early day?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.615
No...

23:04.651 --> 23:06.584
I have to change for a work interview.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.885
This is too wrinkly.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.021
Maybe if you didn't
sleep in your clothes...

23:10.056 --> 23:12.023
It buys me ten extra minutes of sleep.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.958
What's this interview about?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.960
They want me to talk about

23:15.995 --> 23:18.729
how great it is to work at Speckulate.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.965
I feel like a total sellout.

23:23.903 --> 23:24.969
Why aren't you at work?

23:25.004 --> 23:29.840
I called in sick to spend
the day in bed with Jeff.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.742
He wants me to move back to Wisconsin.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.287
I feel like I have
to tell you something.

23:39.819 --> 23:43.854
I overheard Jeff talking
on the phone about...

23:43.890 --> 23:44.890
his wife.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.660
He's married, Davia.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.798
I know.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.990
How long have you known?

24:03.026 --> 24:04.203
Since I sang at their wedding.

24:04.227 --> 24:06.794
They're not happy.

24:07.897 --> 24:08.929
But still...

24:10.033 --> 24:11.866
How can you date a married man?

24:11.901 --> 24:14.201
How can you say how great
it is to work at Speckulate?

24:14.237 --> 24:17.872
You do it for the big fat paycheck...

24:17.907 --> 24:19.840
I do it for the sex.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.210
And because he gets me, and he
makes me feel good about myself.

24:24.847 --> 24:27.181
So you do you, and I'll do me.

24:48.037 --> 24:49.270
Who did this?

24:49.305 --> 24:53.240
Who... who clogged the toilet
with a shit-ton waste of paper?

24:53.276 --> 24:56.143
Are you kidding? We're supposed
to be sharing resources,

24:56.179 --> 24:59.180
not just flushing it
down the toilet, okay?

24:59.215 --> 25:03.851
I'm not gonna drown every
ounce of toilet paper...

25:03.886 --> 25:05.853
and Mother Earth...
down the drain, okay?

25:05.888 --> 25:07.328
And someone else can do it for once!

25:13.162 --> 25:14.795
I'm not gonna do it!

25:14.831 --> 25:17.164
You get one more question
each, then you have to guess.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.900
- Was it a 2nd Amendment case?
- No.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.069
Did the case deal with
administrative law?

25:22.105 --> 25:23.204
No.

25:23.239 --> 25:25.106
Was it a civil or criminal case?

25:26.976 --> 25:30.811
I just told Rebecca yes
or no questions only.

25:30.847 --> 25:32.012
Sorry, you lose your turn,

25:32.048 --> 25:33.168
and you have to guess first.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.883
What's my case?

25:35.918 --> 25:38.018
Glossip v. Gross.

25:41.924 --> 25:43.224
Are you Hill v. McDonough?

25:45.161 --> 25:46.161
No.

25:47.096 --> 25:48.229
Rebecca?

25:48.264 --> 25:50.064
Are you Burwell v. Hobby Lobby?

25:50.099 --> 25:52.233
I am not. Two down, one to go.

25:52.268 --> 25:54.235
Ben.

25:54.270 --> 25:56.137
Are you Glossip v. Gross?

25:59.976 --> 26:01.142
I am...

26:01.177 --> 26:02.877
not.

26:05.047 --> 26:06.947
I'm Hollingsworth v. Perry.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.820
You're welcome to turn over the card

26:12.855 --> 26:13.888
if you don't believe me.

26:15.124 --> 26:17.124
Of course, I believe you, your honor.

26:23.933 --> 26:25.099
So...

26:25.134 --> 26:27.001
What do you three geniuses have for me?

26:38.915 --> 26:40.181
You look nice.

26:40.216 --> 26:41.815
I mean, uh, did you change?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.164
Are you doing this interview?

26:45.188 --> 26:47.121
Yeah, we sort of have to.

26:47.156 --> 26:49.490
And you're fine with saying
how diverse and inclusive

26:49.525 --> 26:51.158
the culture is here?

26:51.194 --> 26:53.861
Aren't you sick of putting up
with people like Alex and Sam?

26:53.896 --> 26:55.207
I mean, don't you ever
want to say something?

26:55.231 --> 26:56.931
All the time!

26:56.966 --> 26:59.200
But if I do, you know that'll
just make things worse.

26:59.235 --> 27:02.836
Well, you may be able
to play that game, but...

27:02.872 --> 27:04.249
They want to know what
it's like to work here,

27:04.273 --> 27:05.773
I'm gonna tell them.

27:05.808 --> 27:06.974
And if I get fired,

27:07.009 --> 27:09.109
then at least someone
had the guts to speak up.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.887
Why are you doing that?

27:19.922 --> 27:21.055
Who else is gonna do it?

27:21.090 --> 27:23.023
No one as long as
everyone knows you will.

27:25.995 --> 27:28.095
Can't believe I lost
it over toilet paper.

27:28.130 --> 27:29.863
I'm an awful person.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.066
You know, if you were an awful person,

27:32.101 --> 27:33.212
I'd still be living in my car.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.803
Come on, that was nothing.

27:35.838 --> 27:38.172
Nothing? You split your loft for me.

27:40.109 --> 27:41.942
You gave me a safe place to live

27:41.978 --> 27:43.844
where I had friends and support.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.247
That was not "nothing."

27:47.850 --> 27:49.083
But you also set boundaries.

27:49.118 --> 27:51.218
You gave me three
months to get on my feet,

27:51.254 --> 27:53.821
get a better job, and pay the rent.

27:53.856 --> 27:54.989
Or else I'd have to go.

27:55.024 --> 27:56.257
- I said that?
- Yes.

27:56.292 --> 27:59.059
- That's so mean.
- I'm gonna smack you.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.794
You were much nicer back then.

28:00.830 --> 28:02.870
That's because I didn't
know you, now we're family.

28:05.001 --> 28:06.878
You gotta stop letting
people take advantage of you.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.235
I have commitments, okay?

28:08.271 --> 28:10.237
You are not the Mother
Teresa of ass-wiping.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.806
You don't have to give
people free toilet paper

28:12.842 --> 28:14.875
or plan Sumi's stupid wedding.

28:16.812 --> 28:18.090
Sometimes you gotta
break your commitments

28:18.114 --> 28:19.780
to take care of yourself, Alice.

28:39.135 --> 28:40.968
Oh, good, come on in.

28:56.285 --> 28:58.852
Please give us your name and position.

28:58.888 --> 29:01.155
My name is Mariana Adams Foster.

29:01.190 --> 29:02.222
I'm an engineer.

29:02.258 --> 29:05.859
And tell us what it's
like working at Speckulate.

29:09.899 --> 29:11.799
Blowing up your career

29:11.834 --> 29:14.034
is not gonna change the
culture around here, Mariana.

29:14.070 --> 29:16.804
You can vent to me anytime,

29:16.839 --> 29:18.806
but I would hate for us to lose

29:18.841 --> 29:20.808
another talented Latina engineer.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.232
Tell us what it's like,
working at Speckulate.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.139
It sucks.

29:35.174 --> 29:38.108
The culture is sexist and racist,

29:38.144 --> 29:39.376
and it's a big boys' club.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.984
It's great!

29:47.019 --> 29:48.218
It's a real meritocracy.

29:48.254 --> 29:51.121
There's a lot of opportunity for growth.

29:59.031 --> 30:02.399
- Am I considered a conservative figure?
- No.

30:02.435 --> 30:04.168
- Am I a defendant?
- No.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.436
- Am I Hayward Patterson?
- No.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.104
- Am I Dred Scott?
- No.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.316
- Am I on the Supreme Court?
- No.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.473
- Am I a president?
- No.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.219
Did I ever work for the
United States government?

30:11.243 --> 30:12.454
- No.
- Am I a well known activist?

30:12.478 --> 30:14.144
- No.
- Am I considered a jurist?

30:14.180 --> 30:17.114
- No.
- Do I apply the law on behalf of clients?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.016
- No.
- Am I a U.S. citizen?

30:19.051 --> 30:20.150
- Yes.
- Am I a man?

30:20.186 --> 30:21.485
- Yes.
- Am I from the South?

30:21.520 --> 30:25.255
- Yes.
- Have I ever been accused of committing a crime?

30:25.291 --> 30:26.291
Yes.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.359
Am I John W. Terry?

30:29.395 --> 30:31.161
No.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.131
You're down to your last two questions.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.366
Only two? Are you sure?

30:36.402 --> 30:38.522
Maybe you're about to get
stumped for the first time.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.504
Are you mocking me, Ben?

30:40.539 --> 30:43.173
Uh, no, no sir.

30:43.209 --> 30:46.110
Have I been involved
in a high profile case

30:46.145 --> 30:47.145
within the last decade?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.246
- Yes.
- Last question.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.281
I'm aware.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.520
Was the case tried in Florida?

30:55.554 --> 30:56.554
Yes.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.190
Who are you?

31:00.226 --> 31:03.127
Am I petitioner Terrence Jamar Graham?

31:04.330 --> 31:06.296
You are not!

31:19.445 --> 31:21.044
Is this a joke?

31:21.080 --> 31:24.148
How is Hulk Hogan
considered a legal character?

31:24.183 --> 31:26.383
- Because of his suit against Gawker.
- Yeah.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.292
I can't say that your
choice was terribly clever

31:35.327 --> 31:37.327
or completely legitimate,

31:37.363 --> 31:39.029
but I'll concede defeat.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.498
Thank you for coming.

31:41.534 --> 31:43.033
I know you have work to do,

31:43.068 --> 31:45.202
seeing as you're all
behind on your casework.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.037
See that you're caught
up by Monday morning.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.021
So much for my Norma Rae moment.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.024
It's an old movie.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.026
My moms love it.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.028
My grandfather's
favorite movie was Rocky.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.431
Every champion was once a contender

32:14.466 --> 32:16.300
who refused to give up.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.070
I made the mistake
of imitating him once,

32:20.105 --> 32:21.416
and now Alex thinks it's okay for him

32:21.440 --> 32:24.007
to put on an Indian
accent and make jokes.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.377
Why do you laugh?

32:29.248 --> 32:31.281
I guess to make them
feel more comfortable

32:31.317 --> 32:34.051
with me being different than them,

32:34.086 --> 32:36.386
and prove I'm not too sensitive.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.155
Why do we make them comfortable

32:38.190 --> 32:39.510
when we're the ones getting hurt?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.460
To get ahead, we have
to fit in to succeed.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.432
Okay, don't laugh, but...

32:48.467 --> 32:50.334
In high school I dyed my hair blonde

32:50.369 --> 32:52.269
so I would make the dance team.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.138
I just said "don't laugh."

32:55.174 --> 32:56.318
Sorry, I'm not laughing at you.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.108
I...

32:58.143 --> 33:00.310
dyed my hair, too... in high school.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.380
Frosted tips to fit in
with my skater friends.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.115
Wow!

33:07.253 --> 33:10.954
I thought, after school,
we'd be done with all that.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.024
Thought it'd be different
in the workplace.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.526
Me, too.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.396
Alex and Sam are lucky
they can just be themselves.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.266
As a woman, I can't even
wear a dress to work,

33:22.301 --> 33:24.167
because people won't take me seriously.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.470
Well, I take you seriously.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.406
And the next time we go out
as a team, you're coming with.

33:29.441 --> 33:34.244
Honestly, I really don't want to
hang out socially with Alex or Sam.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.046
Honestly, me either.

33:38.284 --> 33:41.285
Well, maybe we can just
get a drink one night.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.254
Anytime.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.290
How about tonight?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.126
Sure!

33:52.498 --> 33:55.499
I wish you could fly out in the morning.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.501
I know, me too.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.170
I've got meetings.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.408
So listen, I've been thinking...

34:06.045 --> 34:08.165
You should extend your
contract to Teach for America.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.081
I think you're idealizing home,

34:11.116 --> 34:12.556
just because you're struggling here.

34:14.186 --> 34:18.355
I envy that you left, and you live
in this cool place in this great city.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.292
I wish I'd had the courage to leave.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.996
I think I'm just saying...

34:26.031 --> 34:28.098
to just give it more time

34:28.132 --> 34:29.399
before you decide to move home.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.143
You were always meant for
more than just Fitchburg.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.206
You're right.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.208
I'll be back in a few weeks.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.212
- I'll call you then?
- Sure.

35:07.072 --> 35:11.108
Here's to being the first
clerks to ever stump Wilson.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.343
Which we're all gonna pay for.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.115
- Another round?
- Not for me.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.830
We have a lot of work
to do before Monday.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.353
I'll take a rain check on
drinking you under the table.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.389
Anytime.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.069
I still can't get over the
judge hiding his son upstairs.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.292
You get any idea why?

35:35.367 --> 35:36.400
We still have company.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.102
Sorry, I thought they were gone.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.184
You, uh, showed a lot
of character today.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.664
I know Libby told you that
the case was Glossip v. Gross.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.056
You could have cheated
tonight, but you didn't.

35:59.091 --> 36:01.391
To me that earned you the
right to keep your case.

36:03.195 --> 36:06.296
I expect that information
to stay between us.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.131
Of course.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.268
Thank you.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.006
Good night.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.212
No.

36:38.580 --> 36:39.679
Hi.

36:39.715 --> 36:40.781
Hi.

36:47.556 --> 36:50.590
Uh, I know that you've
all come to depend on me.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.659
Not to say that I'm not...

36:52.694 --> 36:54.494
Not that I'm not dependable.

36:54.530 --> 36:55.829
I'm very dependable.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.767
I feel horrible, you know...

37:00.803 --> 37:02.769
Because I know I made a promise.

37:04.540 --> 37:07.774
But after lengthy deliberation and input

37:07.810 --> 37:12.913
from some Coterie members that
shall remain nameless, um...

37:12.948 --> 37:14.581
I am s... sor...

37:15.951 --> 37:17.450
Dammit.

37:18.687 --> 37:19.820
Um...

37:19.855 --> 37:22.556
I'm not pleased to announce
that I will no longer

37:22.591 --> 37:25.592
be providing communal toilet paper.

37:27.496 --> 37:31.464
Okay... Is that all?

37:31.500 --> 37:32.732
Yes, uh...

37:32.768 --> 37:33.812
I'm happy to take questions.

37:34.903 --> 37:36.703
- Okay, cool.
- All right, whatever.

37:39.575 --> 37:42.475
There's... there's chips! I made salsa.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.678
- Self-respect.
- Yeah.

37:44.713 --> 37:46.479
- Doesn't it feel good?
- Mm-hmm.

38:13.609 --> 38:14.674
Oh!

38:14.710 --> 38:15.710
Hey!

38:17.946 --> 38:19.479
Hi.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.748
Guys, this is my co-worker, Raj.

38:21.783 --> 38:22.916
- Hi.
- Hi, how's it going?

38:22.951 --> 38:24.762
And this is Davia, and this is Bryan.

38:24.786 --> 38:27.721
- Hey.
- Quick, Mariana!

38:27.756 --> 38:28.876
Look over on your far right.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.524
Gray jacket.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.793
Oooo, yes! One hundred percent.

38:33.829 --> 38:37.597
That is so my type. I
would climb him like a tree.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.612
Oh, fudge!

38:57.786 --> 38:59.686
Alice, are you in here?

39:04.493 --> 39:05.493
Yeah.

39:06.528 --> 39:08.768
I wanted to talk to you
about bridesmaids dresses.

39:13.702 --> 39:15.568
Okay, uh, I'll be right out.

39:16.638 --> 39:17.871
Okay.

39:17.906 --> 39:19.472
Love you.

39:20.742 --> 39:23.677
I love you, too.

39:45.701 --> 39:47.467
I can go it alone from here.

39:47.502 --> 39:49.622
I don't mind. You, uh,
shouldn't walk alone at night.

39:50.605 --> 39:53.673
Anyway, if I was wrong
about Glossip v. Gross,

39:53.709 --> 39:55.575
why not turn over the index card?

39:55.610 --> 39:56.776
Unless I was right,

39:56.812 --> 39:59.479
and the judge didn't want me to win.

39:59.514 --> 40:00.613
Why?

40:00.649 --> 40:02.482
Maybe he didn't want
me to steal your case,

40:02.517 --> 40:04.197
which I never would
have done, by the way.

40:05.587 --> 40:07.721
I just don't know how
to get Wilson to like me.

40:07.756 --> 40:10.457
I mean, I'm a likable guy, right?

40:12.561 --> 40:13.972
Maybe if you didn't just say
what you think he wants to hear.

40:13.996 --> 40:17.731
Look, I'm not the counter-clerk,
all right? That's your job.

40:19.868 --> 40:20.868
This is me.

40:22.704 --> 40:25.505
Oh, you, uh, live in a theater.

40:25.540 --> 40:28.375
- Yeah, the top floors are lofts.
- Nice.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.010
You, uh, got anything to drink up there?

40:30.779 --> 40:31.911
I'm beat.

40:31.947 --> 40:33.780
Yeah.

40:33.815 --> 40:35.715
Yeah, no worries. Maybe...
maybe another time.

40:35.751 --> 40:36.850
Thanks for the walk home.

40:36.885 --> 40:38.485
No problem. Good night.

41:11.787 --> 41:12.787
You okay?
