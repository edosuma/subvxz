00:04.325 --> 00:06.747
Previously, on the Truth About
the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:06.847 --> 00:08.469
I told you, Bobbo.

00:08.569 --> 00:10.551
Harry Quebert is taking
Jenny to Augusta

00:10.651 --> 00:11.552
to see the fireworks.

00:11.652 --> 00:13.153
Who's Harry Quebert?

00:13.253 --> 00:14.675
Mom, I don't think
he's coming.

00:14.775 --> 00:16.196
Who the hell is
getting married?

00:16.296 --> 00:17.597
Excuse me.

00:17.697 --> 00:18.838
Tell us already.

00:18.938 --> 00:21.361
What are we supposed
to be celebrating?

00:21.461 --> 00:22.762
Um...

00:22.862 --> 00:24.684
My dear friends,

00:24.784 --> 00:26.766
we have a new color television.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.888
Robert has cancer.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.449
-What?
-Here's to Bobbo.

00:30.549 --> 00:33.272
Oh, you
poor thing.

00:35.954 --> 00:37.616
[Jenny yelps in fright]
Oh, my God!

00:37.716 --> 00:39.057
Luther, you scared me! Geez!

00:39.157 --> 00:40.618
What does he want
from you?

00:40.718 --> 00:42.660
He's a friend.
Ow, you're hurting me.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.302
Did somebody do that
to you, Jenny?

00:44.402 --> 00:47.685
You know Luther Caleb,
Stern's chauffeur?

00:49.166 --> 00:51.468
<i>[Elijah Stern]: I had hoped</i>
<i>that Nola would be the last,</i>

00:51.568 --> 00:52.990
<i>that he would paint her</i>

00:53.090 --> 00:55.512
<i>and get whatever it was</i>
<i>out of his system.</i>

00:55.612 --> 00:57.914
So you think it was Luther
who killed Nola?

00:58.014 --> 01:00.897
I've thought so
for the last 33 years.

01:02.578 --> 01:03.920
Is this Luther's handwriting?

01:04.020 --> 01:06.202
His instructions
for pruning roses.

01:06.302 --> 01:09.004
You can keep it
if it'll help you.

01:09.104 --> 01:11.927
Nola's home life
was not a happy one.

01:12.027 --> 01:13.849
Nola, is somebody beating you?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.330
It's my mom.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.612
She says
I'm a wicked girl.

01:17.712 --> 01:18.533
That's crazy.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.635
My mother told me
I had to be punished.

01:23.157 --> 01:24.218
[gasping]

01:24.318 --> 01:26.220
Take a look at that.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.462
"Nola, my darling,

01:28.562 --> 01:31.665
were you to die,
where would my love go?"

01:31.765 --> 01:33.767
Keep it in your safe for now.

01:34.568 --> 01:36.570
[scoffs]

01:37.971 --> 01:40.433
[whispering] You're gonna
be a great writer,

01:40.533 --> 01:43.356
and we're gonna get
a big sun-colored dog,

01:43.456 --> 01:46.279
a Labrador we'll name Storm.

01:46.379 --> 01:48.481
<i>The big news out of the State</i>
<i>courthouse this morning</i>

01:48.581 --> 01:50.923
<i>is that Harry Quebert</i>
<i>is being released on bail</i>

01:51.023 --> 01:52.284
<i>due to lack of evidence.</i>

01:52.384 --> 01:54.126
[Roth]: The handwriting
isn't Harry's.

01:54.226 --> 01:57.088
He didn't write the note
on that goddamn manuscript.

01:57.189 --> 01:58.890
Gareth is staying
at the Montburry Motel

01:58.990 --> 02:00.572
since his release.

02:00.672 --> 02:02.053
They informed everyone in town

02:02.153 --> 02:04.655
there's a registered
sex offender in their midst.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.297
Pratt found
the black Monte Carlo,

02:06.397 --> 02:07.578
then he dismissed it?

02:07.678 --> 02:09.540
I'll call the station,
find out where he is.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.642
No, actually,
I already know.

02:13.043 --> 02:14.064
Pratt, open up!

02:14.164 --> 02:15.465
[kicking door]

02:15.565 --> 02:17.567
Shit!

02:20.770 --> 02:24.774
[âªâªâªâªâª]

03:22.467 --> 03:24.368
It appears there's been
a development...

03:24.468 --> 03:26.791
[hum of conversations]

03:45.848 --> 03:46.829
[sighs]

03:46.929 --> 03:48.631
Chief Pratt
killed himself?

03:48.731 --> 03:50.232
You'd think so,
but no.

03:50.332 --> 03:51.794
Murdered.

03:51.894 --> 03:52.875
What?

03:52.975 --> 03:54.636
Yeah, a couple
of good whacks

03:54.736 --> 03:56.598
at the back of the head.

03:56.698 --> 03:58.700
That's like Nola.

03:59.861 --> 04:01.562
Pratt was protecting somebody

04:01.663 --> 04:04.165
who was afraid
that now he'd talk.

04:04.265 --> 04:06.647
With everybody knowing
what he did to Nola,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.249
he knew he had nothing to lose.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.650
Yeah, except his life.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.211
Yeah, except that.

04:11.311 --> 04:13.674
You have a theory?

04:14.795 --> 04:18.038
I keep coming back
to Elijah Stern.

04:19.919 --> 04:22.662
<i>What if Stern got home</i>
<i>from meetings that day,</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:26.025
<i>August 30th, like he said.</i>

04:26.125 --> 04:30.829
<i>He finds Luther gone,</i>
<i>and so is the Monte Carlo.</i>

04:30.929 --> 04:33.832
<i>Maybe he hears on the radio</i>
<i>that Nola is missing,</i>

04:33.932 --> 04:36.635
<i>and that sends him out</i>
<i>searching for Luther,</i>

04:36.735 --> 04:38.877
<i>worried he's mixed up in it...</i>

04:38.977 --> 04:40.798
[power window whines]

04:40.899 --> 04:42.320
Evening, Officer.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.041
-Evening.
-What's going on?

04:44.141 --> 04:46.604
Well, we got reports
of a missing girl in the area,

04:46.704 --> 04:48.205
so we're asking people
to stay off the roads

04:48.305 --> 04:49.486
until we find her.

04:49.586 --> 04:50.728
Missing girl?

04:50.828 --> 04:51.889
Where are you
headed tonight?

04:51.989 --> 04:53.730
Uh, I was just
on my way home,

04:53.830 --> 04:55.892
but I'm sure
I can find another way.

04:55.992 --> 04:56.893
We'd appreciate that, sir,

04:56.993 --> 04:58.254
if you don't mind
turning around.

04:58.355 --> 04:59.456
Have a good night.

04:59.556 --> 05:01.557
You too.

05:02.158 --> 05:05.141
<i>[Perry continues]: But</i>
<i>maybe instead of going home,</i>

05:05.241 --> 05:07.243
<i>Stern drove to Goose Cove.</i>

05:24.619 --> 05:26.080
<i>Maybe he finds Luther there,</i>

05:26.180 --> 05:29.523
<i>who confesses to killing</i>
<i>Deborah Cooper as well...</i>

05:29.623 --> 05:30.884
[breathing hard]
Please help me.

05:30.984 --> 05:34.628
Get a shovel and a pickaxe
from the shed.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.851
<i>[Perry]: Luther tended</i>
<i>the grounds at Goose Cove,</i>

05:37.951 --> 05:41.734
<i>so it makes sense that</i>
<i>they would bury Nola there.</i>

05:41.834 --> 05:43.176
<i>After they dig the grave,</i>

05:43.276 --> 05:44.897
<i>Luther could've</i>
<i>secretly written</i>

05:44.997 --> 05:47.119
<i>the farewell note to Nola.</i>

05:54.046 --> 05:55.187
After that,

05:55.287 --> 05:56.948
Stern needs to find
a way to protect Luther,

05:57.048 --> 05:57.989
and that way is Pratt.

05:58.089 --> 06:00.552
Pratt?

06:00.652 --> 06:02.193
Let's say Luther
saw Pratt grab Nola,

06:02.293 --> 06:04.355
pull her into his car.

06:04.455 --> 06:06.997
You know, Luther had been
watching her like a hawk.

06:07.098 --> 06:08.999
Let's say he told Stern.
-Mm-hmm.

06:09.099 --> 06:11.281
Stern goes to see Pratt.

06:11.381 --> 06:13.964
He tells him, "You let Luther
get out of town clean,

06:14.064 --> 06:16.146
and I'll let you get away with
what you did to that girl."

06:17.867 --> 06:20.290
<i>But even if Pratt lets him</i>
<i>get away with the murder,</i>

06:20.390 --> 06:23.332
<i>maybe Luther can't live</i>
<i>with what he did.</i>

06:23.432 --> 06:24.894
[Luther]: I'm so sorry, Eli.

06:24.994 --> 06:26.996
[car engine starts]

06:30.039 --> 06:31.780
<i>He commits suicide</i>
<i>a few days later</i>

06:31.880 --> 06:33.882
<i>by driving his car off a cliff.</i>

06:40.208 --> 06:41.829
And the weirdest part
in all this, though...

06:41.929 --> 06:44.392
why would Stern go
through all this mess,

06:44.492 --> 06:46.353
I mean, maybe even
kill someone,

06:46.454 --> 06:48.455
to protect Luther?

06:50.858 --> 06:53.920
Still trying
to figure that part out.

06:54.021 --> 06:56.743
[distant thunder rumbles]

07:09.074 --> 07:11.076
[car door closes]

07:13.719 --> 07:16.421
They're burying her today,
aren't they?

07:16.521 --> 07:19.023
Yeah.

07:19.124 --> 07:22.847
They're burying her,
and I'm not there.

07:25.730 --> 07:28.953
[groaning]

07:29.053 --> 07:31.054
Ah, I wish I was dead.

07:35.779 --> 07:40.363
And may she rest
in eternal peace.

07:40.463 --> 07:42.465
[âªâªâªâªâª]

07:49.111 --> 07:51.793
[cameras snapping]

08:37.435 --> 08:38.937
Hi, um....

08:39.037 --> 08:41.139
can I just get a hot tea
and a shot of brandy, please?

08:41.239 --> 08:42.060
Be right back.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.501
Thank you.

08:43.601 --> 08:48.065
"Female of the species
with a formidable sting."

08:48.165 --> 08:52.349
Four letters,
starts with "W."

08:52.449 --> 08:54.351
Ha! "Wife."

08:54.451 --> 08:56.853
I think it's "wasp."

08:59.135 --> 09:00.516
Hey, Mr. Quinn.

09:00.617 --> 09:02.618
Yeah.

09:03.859 --> 09:05.321
May I?

09:05.421 --> 09:06.762
Of course.

09:06.862 --> 09:07.843
Thanks.

09:07.943 --> 09:09.965
How's your book
going?

09:10.065 --> 09:11.567
Slowly.

09:11.667 --> 09:15.050
There's a lot of gray areas
to clear up, you know.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.152
[clears throat]

09:18.873 --> 09:21.496
Listen, I wanted to ask you, um,

09:21.596 --> 09:25.339
did your wife ever mention
a compromising note she had

09:25.439 --> 09:27.441
that Harry Quebert wrote?

09:27.841 --> 09:29.143
How did you know
about that?

09:29.243 --> 09:30.504
Well, your wife told me.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.705
She told me,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.066
but then she said
it went missing,

09:33.166 --> 09:34.948
and I... [chuckles]

09:35.048 --> 09:36.870
Look, all due respect,

09:36.970 --> 09:38.151
it's a little hard to know
what to believe

09:38.251 --> 09:40.073
when it comes to, uh...

09:40.173 --> 09:42.875
Believe her, Mr. Goldman.

09:42.975 --> 09:45.197
My wife may not be the sweetest
thing in the world,

09:45.297 --> 09:47.900
but she doesn't lie.

09:55.387 --> 10:02.133
[singing to himself]

10:02.233 --> 10:03.935
[door closes]

10:04.035 --> 10:05.016
Mr. Quinn?

10:05.116 --> 10:06.497
Nola? [chuckles]
Hey, sweetie.

10:06.597 --> 10:07.778
How are you?

10:07.878 --> 10:09.940
Um...

10:10.040 --> 10:11.702
I have to talk to you.

10:11.802 --> 10:13.804
What's up, kiddo?

10:16.046 --> 10:18.027
This, um... this morning,

10:18.128 --> 10:19.309
I went by
Mrs. Quinn's office

10:19.409 --> 10:22.792
to pick up my paycheck,

10:22.892 --> 10:26.615
and I overheard her
talking with Chief Pratt.

10:29.058 --> 10:31.200
Take a look at that.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.122
[Pratt reading]:
"Nola, my darling,

10:34.222 --> 10:38.326
were you to die,
where would my love go?

10:38.426 --> 10:41.329
To lose you is to lose
every part of me,

10:41.429 --> 10:45.853
for I have secretly
bequeathed to you

10:45.953 --> 10:49.777
all that I am..."

10:49.877 --> 10:51.138
[Tamara]:
See, he's a criminal

10:51.238 --> 10:52.379
and a sexual predator.

10:52.479 --> 10:54.981
Now, what are you
gonna do about it?

10:55.081 --> 10:57.143
Well, I can't do
anything right away.

10:57.243 --> 10:59.025
Why the hell not?

10:59.125 --> 11:02.148
You entered his house
illegally, Tamara.

11:02.248 --> 11:03.950
You stole his property.

11:04.050 --> 11:04.990
I could get in trouble

11:05.091 --> 11:06.872
just for having this
in my possession.

11:06.972 --> 11:09.595
Then what do you
suggest we do?

11:09.695 --> 11:11.797
Keep it
in your safe for now.

11:11.897 --> 11:13.038
And don't worry,

11:13.138 --> 11:15.040
you'll see how we deal
with guys like that

11:15.140 --> 11:17.142
around here.

11:19.384 --> 11:22.366
Okay, and...?

11:22.466 --> 11:23.568
Oh...

11:23.668 --> 11:27.211
I need you to get
that note, Mr. Quinn.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.053
I beg you to get
that note, please,

11:29.153 --> 11:31.255
or Harry will
go to jail, and...

11:31.355 --> 11:32.576
it'll be all my fault.

11:32.676 --> 11:34.257
I-I-I'm sorry,
Nola, I don't--

11:34.357 --> 11:35.258
He only wrote that note

11:35.358 --> 11:36.299
because I tried
to kill myself.

11:36.399 --> 11:37.781
It's all my fault.

11:37.881 --> 11:40.183
I'm sorry, Nola, I don't...
I don't... I...

11:40.283 --> 11:42.064
Mr. Quinn,

11:42.165 --> 11:44.026
please, I'm begging you.

11:44.126 --> 11:45.708
Please help me.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.469
Please help us,
do you understand?

11:47.569 --> 11:50.192
I can't do
what you're asking me to.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.114
I can't... condone

11:52.214 --> 11:53.515
whatever's going on
between the two of you.

11:53.615 --> 11:54.436
I-I...

11:54.536 --> 11:56.718
For the love of God?

11:56.818 --> 11:59.981
I don't think God would
approve of it either.

12:01.783 --> 12:04.445
We love each other
like no one's ever loved.

12:04.545 --> 12:06.527
Look at me.

12:06.627 --> 12:09.249
Our love is pure,
and it's beautiful,

12:09.349 --> 12:11.011
and I would do anything for him.

12:11.111 --> 12:13.093
Anything, do you understand?

12:13.193 --> 12:14.134
If I lose him, Mr. Quinn,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.816
it's like losing
a part of myself...

12:16.916 --> 12:21.140
the best part of myself.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.242
I'll never find anyone
like him again.

12:26.725 --> 12:27.866
I don't know what to say, Nola.

12:27.967 --> 12:29.748
You know what it feels like,
Mr. Quinn.

12:29.848 --> 12:32.130

Yes, that is the plan.

This book is yours.

No.

It's your book, Marcus,

when she told you--

38:02.212 --> 38:03.834
No, what I actually said,

38:03.934 --> 38:05.435
and you can check your notes,

38:05.535 --> 38:07.757
is that Nola told me
her mother beat her.

38:07.858 --> 38:10.080
And yes, that was shocking,
considering the fact

38:10.180 --> 38:11.841
that her mother had been dead
for nine years.

I never laid a hand
on my daughter!

39:50.231 --> 39:51.172
Or maybe
it's just because

39:51.272 --> 39:51.873
you don't want people
finding out

39:51.953 --> 39:53.334
what happened in Alabama.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.655
[Travis]: Okay, okay.

39:54.756 --> 39:56.457
Okay, Reverend,
let's not lose our cool here.

39:56.557 --> 39:57.618
Put down the gun.

39:57.718 --> 39:59.059
And we are
going to find out!

39:59.160 --> 40:00.621
[moaning] You are a devil.

40:00.721 --> 40:02.623
You're a devil.

40:02.723 --> 40:05.065
[sobbing] God...

40:05.165 --> 40:07.667
Sorry about the
disturbance, Chief.

40:07.767 --> 40:10.450
We'll be on our way.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.794
[airplane engines roar]

40:14.894 --> 40:16.155
Thanks for doing this.

40:16.255 --> 40:17.236
Really appreciate it.

40:17.336 --> 40:18.757
Oh, happy to help.

40:18.858 --> 40:19.798
Here.

40:19.899 --> 40:22.361
Thought you might
find this interesting.

40:22.461 --> 40:25.203
David Kellergan married
Louisa Bonneville

40:25.303 --> 40:27.205
in 1955,

40:27.305 --> 40:28.486
and became a pastor

40:28.587 --> 40:30.568
in the parish
of Mount Pleasant.

40:30.668 --> 40:33.291
Five years later,
Nola was born.

40:33.391 --> 40:34.452
To everybody,

40:34.552 --> 40:35.653
they seemed like
the perfect

40:35.753 --> 40:38.676
God-fearing
Alabama family...

40:40.678 --> 40:43.320
until the tragedy in 1966.

40:46.603 --> 40:48.825
What tragedy?

40:48.925 --> 40:50.707
The Reverend came home
at 2:00 a.m.

40:50.807 --> 40:53.109
<i>after spending the evening</i>

40:53.209 --> 40:55.211
<i>at a dying parishioner's</i>
<i>bedside.</i>

41:00.215 --> 41:02.498
Louisa! Oh, God!

41:10.185 --> 41:12.186
[gasping]

41:14.188 --> 41:15.530
[winces in pain] Ah!

41:15.630 --> 41:17.631
[wood splintering]

41:18.993 --> 41:20.995
Louisa!

41:23.597 --> 41:25.599
Nola!

41:41.533 --> 41:42.915
<i>[Officer]: His wife was found</i>
<i>burned to death,</i>

41:43.015 --> 41:44.836
<i>but his daughter survived.</i>

41:44.936 --> 41:47.479
The tragedy occurred
on August 30th.

41:47.579 --> 41:49.080
Holy shit!

41:49.180 --> 41:51.523
Nola disappeared
nine years later to the day.

41:51.623 --> 41:54.685
For a long time after,
there was some talk.

41:54.785 --> 41:55.726
I mean, the pastor
just so happens

41:55.826 --> 41:57.728
to show up in time
to save his daughter,

41:57.828 --> 41:59.830
but not his wife.

42:01.392 --> 42:05.095
Seems fishy, but they had
no evidence against him.

42:05.195 --> 42:07.717
[door closes,
car engine starts]

42:12.562 --> 42:14.564
[car engine turns off]

42:20.809 --> 42:22.751
Pastor Lewis worked
at a neighboring parish.

42:22.851 --> 42:24.793
He was a good friend
of the Kellergans.

42:24.893 --> 42:26.154
You'll see,

42:26.254 --> 42:29.377
he's still pretty sprightly
for a 90-year-old.

42:32.180 --> 42:35.883
[Pastor Lewis]:
I have never known...

42:35.983 --> 42:39.607
a family...

42:39.707 --> 42:41.568
as happy...

42:41.668 --> 42:43.670
as that one.

42:51.838 --> 42:54.780
David and Louisa,

42:54.881 --> 42:56.942
they were made by the Lord

42:57.043 --> 42:59.164
to love one another.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.709
And Nola,

43:03.809 --> 43:05.791
my...

43:05.891 --> 43:07.953
She was...

43:08.053 --> 43:10.955
an extraordinary,

43:11.055 --> 43:13.738
beautiful little girl.

43:19.223 --> 43:23.867
It gave you
undying hope in humanity.

43:27.070 --> 43:30.934
Until one day...

43:31.034 --> 43:32.815
[beeps remote]

43:32.915 --> 43:34.917
[mechanism whirring]

43:36.519 --> 43:40.082
...we exorcised her.

43:52.774 --> 43:54.675
But...

43:54.775 --> 43:58.879
it didn't go as planned.

43:58.979 --> 44:00.240
Uh...

44:00.341 --> 44:02.402
you exorcised who?

44:02.503 --> 44:07.887
Nola, the little girl.

44:07.988 --> 44:12.091
That girl
had so much evil in her.

44:12.191 --> 44:15.895
The devil's claws
were stuck deep in her heart,

44:15.995 --> 44:20.439
into the depths of her soul.

44:21.880 --> 44:24.903
<i>The night of the fire</i>
<i>did not go</i>

44:25.003 --> 44:29.988
<i>quite the way David Kellergan</i>
<i>told the police.</i>

44:30.088 --> 44:31.589
Nola!

44:31.689 --> 44:32.910
Louisa!

44:33.010 --> 44:34.031
Oh, God!

44:34.132 --> 44:36.133
[gasping]

44:41.618 --> 44:43.080
[wincing in pain] Ah!

44:43.180 --> 44:45.182
[wood splintering]

44:49.546 --> 44:51.547
Nola...

44:52.148 --> 44:53.850
Nola?

44:53.950 --> 44:56.012
Nola! Nola!

44:56.112 --> 44:57.893
[coughing] Nola!

44:57.993 --> 45:00.536
[Nola singing]

45:00.636 --> 45:02.497
âª Singing polly-wolly
doodle all day âª

45:02.598 --> 45:06.541
âª Fare thee well
Fare thee well âª

45:06.641 --> 45:09.704
âª Fare thee well, my fairy fey âª

45:09.804 --> 45:12.467
âª For I'm going to Louisiana
to see my Susyanna âª

45:12.567 --> 45:15.169
âª Singing polly-wolly
doodle all day âª

45:24.458 --> 45:27.701
They stayed
that night with me.

45:30.143 --> 45:33.386
I have never seen a man
so broken.

45:35.027 --> 45:37.049
<i>He must have thought</i>

45:37.149 --> 45:40.933
<i>that little girl</i>
<i>was in shock...</i>

45:41.033 --> 45:43.055
Hi, Daddy.

45:43.155 --> 45:45.317
Hey, sweetie.

45:51.442 --> 45:53.885
I gotta tell you
something.

45:56.047 --> 45:58.068
You remember
last night?

45:58.169 --> 46:00.871
There was a fire
at our house?

46:00.971 --> 46:03.393
Yes?

46:03.493 --> 46:06.596
It wasn't just
a bad dream.

46:06.696 --> 46:08.698
I know.

46:10.500 --> 46:13.202
Something very
serious happened.

46:13.302 --> 46:16.906
Something very sad.

46:18.787 --> 46:21.009
[choking back tears]

46:21.110 --> 46:24.332
Mommy was
in our bedroom

46:24.433 --> 46:28.136
when the fire
happened, and...

46:28.236 --> 46:30.678
she couldn't get out.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.121
She died.

46:35.242 --> 46:36.984
I know.

46:37.084 --> 46:38.706
She was wicked.

46:38.806 --> 46:40.788
She needed to be dead,

46:40.888 --> 46:43.770
so I put the curtains on fire.

46:49.736 --> 46:51.778
[floorboards creak]

47:07.112 --> 47:11.055
<i>[Lewis]: We tried to force</i>
<i>the devil from her body...</i>

47:11.155 --> 47:13.958
but Satan is stubborn!

47:15.319 --> 47:17.141
So you beat a little girl.

47:17.241 --> 47:19.423
No.

47:19.523 --> 47:22.446
We beat the devil.

47:24.287 --> 47:26.289
But Satan is strong.

47:29.052 --> 47:32.035
That little girl

47:32.135 --> 47:36.038
started to believe

47:36.138 --> 47:39.982
that she herself
was her mother.

47:42.144 --> 47:45.807
She was punishing
herself,

47:45.907 --> 47:47.409
whipping herself,

47:47.509 --> 47:51.072
plunging her head
into a bath of icy water.

47:53.674 --> 47:55.676
Well...

47:57.678 --> 48:00.821
that poor little girl,

48:00.921 --> 48:03.964
she was in agony.

48:05.886 --> 48:09.769
Her father couldn't
take any more.

48:11.731 --> 48:15.074
So he decided

48:15.174 --> 48:19.238
to move them both far away.

48:19.338 --> 48:21.640
[gulls crying]

48:21.740 --> 48:24.342
[âªâªâªâªâª]

48:53.209 --> 48:56.272
We're here, Nola.

48:56.372 --> 48:58.534
We're home.

49:02.337 --> 49:07.062
[âªâªâªâªâª]
