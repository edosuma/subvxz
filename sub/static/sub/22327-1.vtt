WEBVTT

00:12.220 --> 00:14.431
[Vincent]
The dream begins the same every time.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.436
[office chatter]

00:32.032 --> 00:33.283
Where's Greg?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.201
Oh, he called in sick.
I'm covering for him.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.996
Just fix it, please. Mr. Corrigan
has a conference call at 8:45.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.289
Not a problem.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.459
Great. Hey, thanks for coming.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.377
-I'm Vincent.
-Screen's locked up again.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.172
I'm gonna need it for a call
in five minutes. Can you get me back up?

00:47.255 --> 00:49.632
Oh, yeah, for sure.
I just need to get back there.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.927
Hal, listen, I gotta let the IT guy work
on the computer for a bit here.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.304
Let me duck into another office.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.722
Let me put you on hold. Hang on.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.183
Just take two minutes, two minutes.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.226
[awkward muttering and chuckles]

01:00.310 --> 01:02.270
Gonna just turn it on and off again,
I guess, huh?

01:02.353 --> 01:04.522
[chuckles] No, no. No, sir.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.239
-[computer shuts down]
-[sighs deeply]

01:28.797 --> 01:30.882
[pained groan]

01:34.636 --> 01:36.262
[groans]

01:40.308 --> 01:44.813
[pained groans]

01:55.115 --> 01:58.243
From the moment I arrived
in the 21st century, something's wrong.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.915
According to the historical record,
Anthony Corrigan, stockbroker...

02:05.250 --> 02:08.044
was at his desk on a conference call.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.964
But instead, it's someone else.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.345
We were wrong.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.310
I try to send the message.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.688
But the computer freezes.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.276
Practiced a hundred times,
but everything's wrong.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.321
Try to reboot the system,
but there's no time now.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.002
[computer chimes]

02:50.295 --> 02:51.963
[sharp beep]

02:53.047 --> 02:54.257
The mission's a failure.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.139
So, why should I sacrifice myself?

03:13.985 --> 03:17.739
[ticking]

03:25.204 --> 03:27.624
I decide I should at least try
to warn them.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.586
Everyone, listen.

03:31.669 --> 03:35.131
I can't explain why, but if you don't
all follow me right now,

03:35.215 --> 03:36.549
you're going to die.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.719
[distant woman laughs]

03:41.304 --> 03:42.764
You have to leave now.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.183
Greg.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.101
What the fuck are you doing?

03:50.688 --> 03:51.773
[Vincent]  I run.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.777
I don't even know what floor I'm on,
only that I have to hurry.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.834
[panting]

04:12.835 --> 04:14.462
First I hear the plane...

04:14.545 --> 04:16.673
[jet airplane engine roars]

04:16.756 --> 04:17.882
and then the explosion.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.970
[explosion]

04:22.887 --> 04:26.849
And I don't remember anything else
until I'm outside looking up.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.810
-Everybody, clear out! Let's go!
-[clamoring]

04:28.893 --> 04:31.646
-[coughs]
-[sirens wailing]

04:39.737 --> 04:42.198
[man] We gotta get
that building evacuated!

05:00.508 --> 05:03.428
Everyone around me is looking
at the destruction above,

05:03.511 --> 05:07.890
while I discard the last vestiges of
the man who was supposed to die that day.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.357
And then I hear the second plane.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.988
[screams rise]

05:23.489 --> 05:24.949
And then I wake up.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.081
[Dr. Perrow] Dreams of 9/11
aren't uncommon, Vincent,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.667
even for those who were
nowhere near Ground Zero.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.670
I have the dream because it happened.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.799
My mission was a proof of concept...

05:42.967 --> 05:46.804
to send a confirmation that I arrived
safely in the 21st century

05:46.888 --> 05:49.432
and die so no one could trace me.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.726
But... I survived.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.313
They won't forgive that.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.816
So you're afraid whomever
you were to send this message to

05:58.900 --> 06:00.109
intends to punish you.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.403
They're already here.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.989
I've seen the changes in history--

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
at least the histories that I remember.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.787
And they'll be coming for me.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.918
[theme music playing]

06:36.813 --> 06:38.856
[sighs]

06:41.401 --> 06:42.402
[beeps]

06:44.529 --> 06:46.948
Walt! Jesus, what took you so long?

06:47.031 --> 06:49.200
You're lucky they gave me permission
to talk to you.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.160
I'm gonna say one thing,
and I need you to listen.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.662
Destroy that device.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.123
By whatever means possible.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.166
I've never asked you
to do anything more important.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.459
What? That thing in the barn?

06:58.543 --> 07:00.336
-You need to do it now.
-What is it?

07:00.419 --> 07:03.381
What is your association
with those people in the barn?

07:03.464 --> 07:05.675
They all raised a red flag
a few months back.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.386
You said that they were
just a bunch of kids.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.097
I ask because two of those people
are in the hospital,

07:11.180 --> 07:12.515
and a farmer is dead.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.397
All right.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.898
I'll talk.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.483
A few weeks ago,

07:22.567 --> 07:25.611
I received a top secret
interdepartmental communication

07:25.695 --> 07:28.114
asking if I'd noticed
any changes in you.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.201
I told a pair of special agents with
very expensive sunglasses that, yeah...

07:32.285 --> 07:34.495
You know your friends
are giving you up as we speak.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.372
Sir, can you please be quiet
so I can think?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.832
[Forbes]
And your wife noticed too.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.917
Nothing that either one of us
could point to,

07:40.001 --> 07:42.086
but enough to say that something is up.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.715
These people, whoever they are,
if they have something on you,

07:45.798 --> 07:47.633
if they're using you,
making you do things,

07:47.717 --> 07:48.968
we can protect you!

07:49.552 --> 07:50.970
Destroy the device.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.681
That's all I got.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.558
They're never gonna do that, boss.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.643
Philip, stay off the comms.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.896
I'm not talking to you anymore.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.663
Before I go...

08:18.998 --> 08:20.958
they wanted me to ask you
about this.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.046
[clears throat] Well, Walt...

08:26.714 --> 08:28.591
that's a handkerchief.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.344
They tell me
it's a communication device.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.637
[softly] Really.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.764
It's made from something called graphine,

08:34.847 --> 08:37.475
a technology we're working on,
but we're not quite there yet.

08:37.558 --> 08:41.562
They suspect that it's powered by
the natural electricity of the human body.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.774
Capable of broadcasting
an encrypted signal for miles.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.986
This one came from the high school
senior that's in surgery right now.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.657
[D-13] How's she doing?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.700
[female doctor]
Rifle shot from point blank range.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.619
There's severe damage
to the spleen, and...

08:56.702 --> 08:57.703
Who are you?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.163
[D-13] Seriously? No one told you?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.499
I'm a specialist, here to assist
from Grace Hospital.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.293
Call me Derek.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.671
[rapid beeping]

09:06.754 --> 09:08.381
[respirator hisses]

09:08.464 --> 09:09.799
[Doctor Mori]
And suction.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.093
Let's take care of that blood.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.389
Bullet's causing a lot of inflammation
between the T-12 and L-1.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.099
I'm worried about the lumbar nerves.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.184
[male doctor] Can't get ahead
of this blood loss, so...

09:20.268 --> 09:21.102
Okay.

09:21.936 --> 09:22.937
Let's get it out of there.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.152
[officer] S tate for the record,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.655
you gave me permission
to look at your phone, listen to messages

09:32.738 --> 09:33.948
without a lawyer present.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.576
Well, I have nothing to hide, so...

09:36.659 --> 09:37.910
Wait, what are you doing?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.538
[officer] Playing back a saved message.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.583
Yeah, that one-- that has nothing
to do with-- with anything.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.712
Sir, the message came from a phone
registered to you

09:47.795 --> 09:51.507
that called this number two seconds
before a man with no identification,

09:51.591 --> 09:54.719
who was allegedly holding
a gun to your head,

09:54.802 --> 09:57.013
was fatally shot
from the apartment next door,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.348
and you saved this message because...?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.143
It's kind of a keeper.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.524
[Marcy]  Hey, David, it's me. Uh...

10:08.608 --> 10:10.985
I guess it's my turn
to leave a goofy message.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.237
I know how stressed you get
when you don't hear from me,

10:13.321 --> 10:16.949
so I wanted you to know that
I might be away for a while,

10:17.033 --> 10:19.285
maybe even relocated.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.204
I just don't want you wondering
or worrying if you don't hear from me.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.497
If-- if it happens.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.541
I don't know for sure if it will,
but if it does...

10:27.460 --> 10:30.838
Thank you for being there for me
when I really needed someone.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.966
[deep breath]  In another time
or another life, right?

10:34.675 --> 10:35.843
Goodbye, David.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.473
See?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.559
-[banging]
-[Jeff] This is bullshit!

10:44.101 --> 10:46.354
Jesus. He's having a bad day.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.064
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.732
Hey, Jeff, keep your voice down.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.401
-I told you what happened.
-The optics suck and you know it.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.445
It's on the news,
you shot a 13-year-old kid.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.405
That was about to shoot Carly.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.616
Who also murdered
her mother and brother last night.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.077
That kid?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.287
Number two pencil to the head,
both of them.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.081
The girl was certifiable.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.750
Now, get Carly's ass down here
to make a statement,

11:07.833 --> 11:10.086
and you're just the poor bastard
who had to stop her.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.171
Okay, Carly's not answering her cell.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.924
We were having trouble at home.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.843
In the meantime, buddy, I'm sorry,
but I gotta take your badge.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.512
Forensics already got your gun.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.429
Aw, come on.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.890
This is bullshit. Can we just
go down the hall and talk--

11:22.973 --> 11:26.018
Hey, no. Not with booze
on your breath, okay?

11:26.102 --> 11:30.022
Hey, if I was forced to shoot a kid,
I might have a few drinks too.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.857
This is gonna work itself out.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.735
Just go home.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.331
I can see there's a fight
going on inside of you.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.711
If you're worried about Kat--

11:52.795 --> 11:55.423
She's completely in the dark about this.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.551
She called me earlier to tell me
that you sent her away.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.929
That your life was in danger,
and so was hers.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.013
Is that true?

12:05.099 --> 12:08.269
It's what made me put a team
together to come after you.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.104
We were tracking your car
and it disappeared,

12:10.187 --> 12:11.522
like it went into a dead zone.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.441
[stammers] But... she's all right?

12:17.027 --> 12:19.655
If you don't talk, you won't walk.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.033
Which means Kat may never, ever
find out whether you were dead or alive.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.995
Destroy the device, Walt. Please.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.748
I'm begging you.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.670
Look, I probably shouldn't tell you this,

12:34.753 --> 12:36.881
but I've also been told
that device is far beyond any--

12:36.964 --> 12:37.798
[door beeps twice]

12:39.758 --> 12:41.427
Thank you, Agent Forbes.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.511
I'll take it from here.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.889
Look, I need more time.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.056
Seriously?

12:47.057 --> 12:49.977
You're telling him
more than he's telling you.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.979
But, hey, thanks for trying.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.317
Walt... remember what I said.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.610
[Wakefield] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.779
Destroy the device.
He heard you the first time.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.781
We all did.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.745
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.124
[Dr. Perrow]
Are you feeling threatened, Vincent?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.835
[gulls calling]

13:14.919 --> 13:16.879
No, I have defenses in place.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.800
Deuterium oxide
in the radiant heating system

13:20.883 --> 13:23.344
acts as a fair space-time attenuator.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.262
It slows neutrons.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.266
Don't worry, it's not radioactive.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.895
Uh, why wouldn't they just assume
that you died on 9/11?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.064
Why do you think
that they're still after you?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.817
Because they've already
found me twice.

13:41.445 --> 13:45.658
I found my way out of New York
and took a train to the Pacific Northwest.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.370
I had the money and the stock certificates
I'd taken from the safe,

13:49.453 --> 13:51.664
but if I was going to stay hidden,
I needed more.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.333
Historically, a man named

13:54.416 --> 13:57.044
Oliver Norton became
a tech millionaire on his own,

13:57.127 --> 13:59.630
and all I did was insert myself
into the process,

13:59.713 --> 14:02.424
as invisibly as possible,
and take my fair share.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.138
I had convinced Oliver
that I had debilitating phobias,

14:08.222 --> 14:12.017
difficulties dealing with people, privacy.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
I needed a front man for my company

14:14.019 --> 14:17.940
that uses proprietary computer software
to predict market trends.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.193
Of course, I wouldn't let anyone see it,
not even him.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.363
As long as the predictions
were correct, he didn't care.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.825
In fact, he was so grateful,
he constantly wanted to reward me.

14:30.119 --> 14:34.039
And that's when Oliver introduced me
to the woman who became Taylor's mother.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.958
[telephone rings]

14:36.041 --> 14:37.668
[office chatter]

14:39.211 --> 14:40.045
Buddy!

14:41.130 --> 14:43.257
-Meet your new assistant.
-Assistant?

14:43.340 --> 14:44.967
[Irene] Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.719
No, no, I don't need an assistant.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.012
[Oliver] Oh, yeah, you do.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.471
I got a company to pretend to run.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.764
No, sorry, I can't.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.057
Trust me, all right?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.351
I already told Irene about
how you like to do things--

14:54.435 --> 14:57.938
no cell phones, portable radios,
web cams, no life, no fun.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.024
And I completely understand.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.942
Me, I... I don't like crowds.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.784
I-I'm-- I'm not sure I'll have
anything for you to-- to do.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.495
High maintenance people always think
that they're low maintenance.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.957
You need this, partner.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.755
It wasn't an assistant I needed,
it was human contact.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.633
And Oliver must have known that.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.763
Y-you said in our initial session
that your wife died of an aneurysm.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.847
Yes.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.766
That was the first time I was discovered.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.850
[Taylor] Dad?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.353
You know I'm not to be disturbed
when I'm in this room.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.397
Sorry, but Pepper wants out,
and Mr. Morraca isn't around.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.901
[Vincent] Well, all right.
Take her out, then.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.402
I'll watch you from here.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.654
[Taylor] Okay.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.155
Hi.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.199
Hello.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.116
Come on, Pepper.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.119
He looks like you.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.704
Fortunately for him,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.832
he looks like the host
who provided the chromosomes.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.334
Not me.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.585
[sighs]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.428
David Mailer.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.305
Yeah.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.182
I'm your lawyer.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.475
I don't have a lawyer.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.395
Philip Pearson said
you might want my help.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.147
I don't know Philip Pearson.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
Friend of Marcy.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.359
Marcy. Oh, my God, yes.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.652
Is she okay?

16:26.735 --> 16:30.447
Are you-- what, are you,
like, an FBI lawyer?

16:30.531 --> 16:32.616
Uh, wow. No, no.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.245
Jeez, he said she said
you were special,

16:36.328 --> 16:38.122
but I didn't realize you were "special."

16:38.706 --> 16:39.915
What?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.250
Sorry, this is--

16:42.251 --> 16:44.670
I-I'm not good at this.
This is so not my thing.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.380
Well, David, fortunately,

16:46.463 --> 16:48.882
this is my thing,
and I am very good at this.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.009
[Ray double-taps desk]

16:50.092 --> 16:51.093
So...

16:51.176 --> 16:54.596
you are probably lookin'
ten years tops,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.306
nine with good behavior.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.810
What?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.563
Nah, just fuckin' with you.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.233
-Why would you--? Oh, my God.
-[Ray chuckles]

17:07.860 --> 17:09.111
Uh...

17:09.194 --> 17:10.571
[Wakefield] This isn't how actual

17:10.654 --> 17:12.948
law enforcement officers behave,
MacLaren.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.242
There's giant chunks of time
missing from your logs.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.370
It's a miracle we didn't catch on
to you people sooner.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.705
"You people"? What's that mean?

17:19.788 --> 17:22.332
Agent Forbes says compared to
just a few months ago,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.878
-you are like a different person...
-Take my blood. Take my fingerprints.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.714
-Take whatever you need.
-...who now spends half his time

17:28.797 --> 17:31.258
with a high school senior,
his counselor,

17:31.341 --> 17:33.802
a single mom, a heroin addict,

17:33.886 --> 17:36.472
a farmer, and-- this one kills me--

17:37.264 --> 17:40.434
a mentally challenged woman
in the care of the state.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.812
Philip Pearson is my CI
on a hacking case.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.399
We suspected the device had something
to do with hijacking the Internet.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.485
Let's skip over the part
where you pretend

17:49.568 --> 17:51.236
there's a legit scenario

17:51.320 --> 17:54.156
where those people
in a fuckin' barn

17:54.239 --> 17:55.991
with whatever that device is

17:56.075 --> 17:58.285
makes any sense whatsoever.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.626
Whoever you are,

18:05.709 --> 18:07.377
and whoever you work for...

18:10.672 --> 18:11.924
we're on to you now.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.012
I'm a single mom.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
There's a lot of folks like me.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.683
This is gonna sound weird,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.435
and possibly insane,

18:23.519 --> 18:25.104
but I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.315
I have a turtle at home,

18:28.398 --> 18:29.733
and I had to leave in a hurry.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.151
There's a lot of broken glass.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
You think this is funny?

18:33.779 --> 18:34.613
No.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.198
[Marcy]  I'm just a librarian.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.200
That's all I am. [stammering]

18:38.283 --> 18:39.785
[Agent Paulson] You're more than that.

[respirator hisses]

18:54.341 --> 18:56.760
-[woman] Scalpel.
-[D-13] Okay.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.220
[urgent beeping]

18:58.303 --> 18:59.429
She's fibrillating.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.724
[urgent beeping]

19:02.808 --> 19:04.601
[female doctor]
I'll clamp it. Prep for defib.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.063
[male doctor]
Can I get some suction here?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.357
[female doctor] Charging. One, two, three.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.608
Clear. Shock.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.402
[soft jolt]

-[respirator hisses]

19:18.448 --> 19:20.826
-[woman] BP is stabilizing.
-There we go.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.124
That's not me.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.042
It's clearly you.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.130
I have no memory of this.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.383
Don't I get a phone call or something?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.719
Who do you want to call?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.262
My babysitter, for one.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.432
Jeffrey, Jr., is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.726
What? Why?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.644
No, he needs to be
with his mother!

19:47.728 --> 19:50.522
God, how long are you going
to keep me here?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.607
Sit back down, please.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.317
[softly] Permission to break
the fuck out of here.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.610
[loudly] I want to see my baby!

19:54.693 --> 19:56.320
-Sit down!
-I want to see him now!

19:56.403 --> 19:57.487
All right, you call it.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.614
I call what?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.283
[Philip]  Uh, guys...

20:01.366 --> 20:02.659
what are we doing?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
Let me see it one more time.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.165
In three.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.876
Two.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.711
I...

20:14.880 --> 20:15.714
One.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.299
[sharp grunts]

20:18.217 --> 20:19.426
[Wakefield groans]

20:20.010 --> 20:21.261
[sharp grunts]

20:26.391 --> 20:27.643
On the move.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.353
[MacLaren] Right behind you.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.108
[beeps]

20:35.943 --> 20:37.569
[softly] Do we know what we're doing?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.071
[MacLaren]  Getting out of here.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.458
Don't forget protocol three.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.585
Don't forget I was ordered to kill you.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.420
Right. This isn't a good time.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.505
[Marcy] Guys.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.798
[MacLaren sighs]

20:57.881 --> 20:59.299
[Marcy] I think Philip's this way.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.138
[breathlessly] I took his legs out.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.223
He went down pretty hard.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.307
Marcy.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.895
Ah, it's probably just a concussion.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.813
He'll live.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.106
Okay, let's go, let's go.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.190
[MacLaren] Come on.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.907
[object clatters]

21:23.991 --> 21:24.825
[Marcy] Hey!

21:24.908 --> 21:27.619
[groans]

21:43.635 --> 21:44.970
That looked like it hurt.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.806
Well, they didn't try to kill anyone,
so you owe me a buck.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.099
What's their progress?

21:49.182 --> 21:50.559
Almost to the gym.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.270
All right.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.063
Let's see what they do.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.363
[Philip] Boss?

22:03.447 --> 22:06.074
[machinery hums]

22:06.158 --> 22:07.868
Jesus Christ.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.203
That isn't the way out.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.497
No, it isn't.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.770
Mac, we gotta go.

22:43.028 --> 22:43.862
Go ahead.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.159
[gun clicks]

22:49.242 --> 22:50.452
Didn't think so.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.249
Okay, we're here.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.334
Now what?

22:59.002 --> 23:01.421
[heavy switches clunk]

23:03.548 --> 23:04.800
[door opens]

23:07.219 --> 23:10.013
We were wondering if you'd
really try to destroy the device,

23:10.097 --> 23:11.473
given the opportunity.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.267
It seemed odd,

23:14.351 --> 23:16.436
considering you built the thing.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.064
Hey, but now that you're here,
maybe you can show us what it does.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.401
Under supervision.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.736
Obviously.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.197
Sorry.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.493
Not gonna happen.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.001
[woman on PA]  Dr. Kravitz,
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.045
Dr. Kravitz, a visitor in the main lobby.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.840
Mr. and Mrs. Holden?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.008
Is Trevor okay?

23:47.092 --> 23:49.219
He's out of surgery,
and we've stopped the bleeding.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.428
What the hell happened?

23:52.222 --> 23:55.016
All I can tell you is that your son
was involved in a shooting,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.519
and that the bullet
we removed in order to save his life

23:57.602 --> 24:00.021
was lodged dangerously close
to his spinal cord.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.357
There's still a great deal
of inflammation.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.650
Can we see him?

24:03.733 --> 24:05.819
[sighs] Tomorrow at the earliest.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.195
So he's gonna be okay?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.906
I'm confident Trevor will survive this.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.533
He's very strong.

24:11.616 --> 24:15.745
But you should know there's a possibility
he may not regain the use of his legs.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.254
How old was Taylor
when his mother died?

24:25.964 --> 24:27.048
A baby.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.513
I spent the latter half of my life
before this one

24:33.597 --> 24:36.516
being eaten away by a disease
that doesn't exist yet.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.979
I never imagined
the possibility of family.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.607
A loving wife.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.900
A child.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.739
Irene was convinced that I'd be angry
when she told me about the baby.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.618
Afraid I'd think she'd trapped me.

24:56.411 --> 25:00.624
But how could she know that...
in the future I'd left behind,

25:00.707 --> 25:02.292
life was so precious...

25:04.127 --> 25:07.005
new life so rare...

25:07.088 --> 25:09.174
most precious of all?

25:09.257 --> 25:10.175
[camera shutter snaps]

25:10.258 --> 25:12.844
Just as she couldn't have known that...

25:12.928 --> 25:15.347
the stolen moment while I slept...

25:16.348 --> 25:19.809
a small token of a perfect memory...

25:20.936 --> 25:22.979
would be the instrument of her death.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.568
[high-pitched whir]

25:35.367 --> 25:37.160
An image of me,
taken on her cell phone,

25:37.244 --> 25:38.870
time and place recorded

25:38.954 --> 25:40.872
and posted to a friend,

25:40.956 --> 25:43.083
discovered and acted upon.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.584
Vincent, I think--

25:44.668 --> 25:46.878
You see, we knew it was possible
to send messages

25:46.962 --> 25:49.714
directly to the 21st
through a host,

25:49.798 --> 25:52.133
but we projected a 40% chance

25:52.217 --> 25:56.471
that an adult mind might not be able
to withstand the shock of transfer.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.848
That's the whole reason
I volunteered to go first.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.810
No one would have to die
that wasn't going to.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.228
Okay, let's just stop.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.313
Artificial intelligence isn't supposed
to be capable

26:05.397 --> 26:07.065
of taking a life that isn't about to end.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.109
The Director shouldn't have risked it.
You understand?

26:09.192 --> 26:10.277
No.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.904
Not one part of what you just said...

26:16.950 --> 26:18.368
[softly] I apologize.

26:23.748 --> 26:28.003
Vincent, I can't help you
if I don't understand what you're saying.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.088
Of course.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.727
[faint electrical pulse]

26:43.810 --> 26:44.644
Hey, guys.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.523
I just want to say...

26:50.275 --> 26:52.819
whatever happens from this point...

26:52.902 --> 26:55.155
be proud of what you accomplished.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.035
I still think
in the grand scheme of things,

27:00.118 --> 27:01.953
we did good.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.330
I know we did.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.418
And I still have faith

27:08.501 --> 27:10.503
the Director will find a way.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.840
I believe that with all my heart.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.968
Just...

27:18.303 --> 27:19.304
maybe not with us.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.268
You all know what you have to do.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.231
Boss, could you be a little more specific?

27:33.276 --> 27:34.486
Self-destruct.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.821
Obviously.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.115
What?

27:39.199 --> 27:40.200
In three.

27:42.994 --> 27:43.995
Two.

27:46.664 --> 27:47.874
One.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.003
[imitates explosion]

27:52.087 --> 27:53.296
[laughing]

27:53.380 --> 27:56.007
[laughing]

27:56.091 --> 27:58.760
[laughing continuing]

28:05.683 --> 28:07.102
Sorry, Wakefield.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.729
You had that coming.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.193
Comm 3468, disable.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.070
Comm 3465, disable.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.530
Comm 3569...

28:18.613 --> 28:19.447
disable.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.740
3326...

28:22.325 --> 28:23.326
disable.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.494
[sharp beep]

28:26.538 --> 28:28.164
So long, you guys.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.550
Well, that's my workday.
Text me if anything happens.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.960
We've gone long past the time I allotted
for this visit.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.962
I was wondering if we could start fresh--

29:58.046 --> 30:00.590
No, I-- no, I'd rather you
stay a little longer.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.428
Vincent, these delusions--

30:05.512 --> 30:06.471
Memories.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.852
--are very complex product
of severe paranoia.

30:12.936 --> 30:13.770
I can't--

30:13.853 --> 30:15.480
I told you, they found me twice.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.439
They?

30:16.523 --> 30:17.524
The Director.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.820
All right.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.571
[clears throat]

30:23.655 --> 30:26.157
Tell me about the second time.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.826
It was a year later.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.745
The company had become quite successful.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.831
You're not gonna believe
how well that meeting went.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.165
Meeting?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.167
With the venture capital company.
I told you.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.836
And I told you it was a bad idea.

30:38.586 --> 30:39.587
They made an offer.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.756
-Now, I-I-I didn't commit...
-No.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.758
...because they want
your software too, but--

30:43.842 --> 30:44.676
No.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.055
Eighty-seven million dollars.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.558
Say no again, I dare you.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.268
Oliver, I told you from the beginning.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.186
I thought we were supposed to be partners!

30:55.270 --> 30:56.771
This is my software.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.858
I've told you, if we affect the market
in any tangible way,

30:59.941 --> 31:01.150
it just doesn't work.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.778
Okay, one, why is that?

31:03.862 --> 31:05.864
And-- and-- and two, who cares,

31:05.947 --> 31:09.200
if we can sell the company
for 87 million?

31:10.368 --> 31:13.454
I'm not taking no for an answer.
You're gonna hear them out.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.039
Oliver, wait. Wait.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.546
[exhales]

31:23.298 --> 31:25.383
There is no predictive software.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.720
It doesn't exist. It never has.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.557
All the computers out there,
the software, it's just for show.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.058
It's a-a-a front.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.226
[Oliver exhales]

31:35.310 --> 31:37.145
Then-- then how are you--

31:37.228 --> 31:38.646
I'm doing it.

31:41.524 --> 31:45.236
No one could have guessed
large market trends

31:45.320 --> 31:47.363
that accurately and that often.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.073
That's true. I'm not guessing.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.575
I'm remembering.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.287
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

31:54.370 --> 31:57.206
It means you can't
sell the company, Oliver.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.333
I'm sorry.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.128
[softly] Hang on a sec.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.296
You can't use that in here.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.840
I'm breaking the rules
'cause you're out of your fucking mind.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.134
If I had stayed silent,
he might have lived,

32:08.217 --> 32:11.304
but the-- the FCC
was investigating the company,

32:11.387 --> 32:12.931
and they had tapped his phone.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.393
Voice recognition and GPS
allowed them to find me

32:17.477 --> 32:18.770
the moment I spoke.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.480
Oliver, please, I told you.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.440
Stop, please, I told you,
it's dangerous.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.524
I said stop!

32:25.860 --> 32:28.321
[high-pitched whir rises]

32:31.950 --> 32:33.368
[flat intonation] Traveler 001,

32:33.451 --> 32:34.953
you are outside mission parameters.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.663
Self-termination required immediately.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.666
[no audible scream]

32:57.767 --> 32:59.352
[female voice]  First new message.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.813
Walter, it's Katherine again.

33:01.896 --> 33:05.274
I'm at my mother's.
Please call me back.

33:14.575 --> 33:15.785
[cell phone chimes]

33:26.087 --> 33:28.965
[indistinct chatter]

33:38.141 --> 33:39.142
[Forbes]
Hey, Callahan.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.935
Any idea what's up?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.854
Wakefield just sent me
a message to come here.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.897
Yeah, most of us
all got the same message.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.107
He does this.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.290
[indistinct chatter]

34:02.373 --> 34:04.000
Okay, here I am.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.376
What's so important?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.587
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
You just texted me.

34:08.713 --> 34:09.672
I what?

34:09.756 --> 34:10.757
Yeah, me too.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.553
[low hum]

34:15.636 --> 34:17.388
[high-pitched whir]

34:17.472 --> 34:20.933
[men screaming]

34:22.101 --> 34:24.520
[no audible screams]

34:24.604 --> 34:25.646
Aah!

34:25.730 --> 34:28.149
[screaming]

34:28.232 --> 34:30.860
[screams resounding]

34:42.914 --> 34:46.000
So, your business partner also died
of an aneurysm?

34:46.084 --> 34:46.959
Yes.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.420
And you became sole owner of the company?

34:49.504 --> 34:50.421
Yes.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.132
You think I killed them.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.137
I told you, it was the Director.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.727
You have nothing to be afraid of,
Dr. Perrow.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.941
I feel so much better having
unpacked myself of all that baggage.

35:10.024 --> 35:13.069
[chuckles]

35:13.152 --> 35:14.153
[sighs]

35:14.237 --> 35:16.280
I feel nothing but gratitude.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.116
Right.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.451
Look, I...

35:20.535 --> 35:22.787
if you don't mind,
I'll be, uh, heading home.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.915
-My daughter will be wondering--
-Of course. I've kept you too long.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.668
And your cell phone
and payment in cash

35:28.751 --> 35:30.002
is ready outside.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.673
And I'd like to schedule
another appointment, please.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.843
[sighs]

35:40.555 --> 35:41.639
Vincent...

35:42.974 --> 35:44.600
you need medication.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.019
I'm not helping.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.354
Of course you are.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.023
It doesn't matter you don't believe me.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.402
[chuckles] I get to talk to someone

35:54.485 --> 35:58.865
who affords me the privacy
of doctor/client privilege.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.992
And you'll get paid a great deal of money.

36:02.451 --> 36:05.288
It really is the ultimate
21st-century arrangement.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.462
[wheels squeak and clatter]

36:21.179 --> 36:22.180
Grace.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
Shh. I had to sneak in here.

36:25.725 --> 36:26.934
What are you doing?

36:27.560 --> 36:30.229
[Grace] Sharing the medical nanites
I was given by D-13

36:30.313 --> 36:31.731
so you'll be able to walk again.

36:31.814 --> 36:32.857
I overheard them talking.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.526
[Trevor] Oh. Thank you.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.694
[Grace] You're welcome.

36:36.777 --> 36:40.573
It's gonna quadruple my recovery time,
but I suppose you're worth it.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.867
There's no sweet nanotech
for me again?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.453
The Director left me out.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.457
You've lived longer than any human
in history, and you're complaining?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.876
I'm starting to take it personally.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.922
[Trevor groans]

36:56.005 --> 36:57.465
[firm tapping]

36:58.549 --> 37:00.843
Wait, don't medical nanites
need to be programmed

37:00.927 --> 37:02.345
to do specific tasks?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.263
Yes, and I am a...

37:04.347 --> 37:05.556
Programmer.

37:06.432 --> 37:10.770
Oh, yeah. I'm-I'm sorry,
I'm all drugged up.

37:10.853 --> 37:12.313
I got shot.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.733
I stepped in front of you, remember?

37:17.318 --> 37:19.195
Oh, wow, you did.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.865
Thank you for saving me, nurse.

37:22.949 --> 37:26.410
Okay, now shut up and heal.
I need to concentrate.

37:27.703 --> 37:30.248
[footsteps approaching]

37:33.459 --> 37:34.460
[dull clatter]

37:34.543 --> 37:35.544
[beeps]

37:38.589 --> 37:40.424
Walt, I-I-I thought--

37:40.508 --> 37:42.510
I'm Traveler 4112.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.097
I'm sorry.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.015
I know he was a friend.

37:48.683 --> 37:49.517
How?

37:49.600 --> 37:53.145
0014 built the quantum frame
with a fail safe,

37:53.229 --> 37:54.855
one that would level this entire building

37:54.939 --> 37:57.108
the moment Wakefield
and his team opened it up.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.236
Which made all of you host candidates.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.446
I heard it happening.
How many?

38:02.530 --> 38:04.782
Twenty-five of us in the gym,
including Wakefield.

38:04.865 --> 38:05.700
What about the--

38:05.783 --> 38:08.077
The quantum frame is being
dismantled and scrapped.

38:09.954 --> 38:10.955
[sighs]

38:12.290 --> 38:13.124
So, that's it.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.918
That's it. It's over, Grant.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.840
Mac. You-- you call me Mac.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.925
They shorten everything,
for some reason.

38:23.926 --> 38:24.844
Mac.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.847
I'm gonna need your help
with a lot of things.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.975
Welcome to the 21st.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.278
[exhales]

38:46.949 --> 38:48.326
[soft gasp]

38:55.750 --> 38:57.251
Thank you.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.419

[buzzing]

39:13.642 --> 39:16.729
[buzzing]

39:16.812 --> 39:19.023
Do you really think it's ethical
to plant a bomb

39:19.106 --> 39:22.651
and then take over the people who
would have died when that bomb went off?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.321
How is that not circular reasoning?

39:25.404 --> 39:29.116
No way the Director would allow
that level of technology in the 21st.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.619
The Director was the one who had it
built in the first place.

39:31.702 --> 39:35.498
Hey. A wise man once told me,
"Take the win."

39:36.332 --> 39:37.208
Hey.

39:38.292 --> 39:41.003
They wouldn't tell me much,
but I got a quick look at the monitors

39:41.087 --> 39:43.339
at the nursing station, and...

39:43.422 --> 39:45.007
they're both gonna recover.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.136
Well, I'll take that win, too.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.723
Come on, everybody,
I'll drop you home.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.016
I think I'm gonna stay.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.311
He would.

39:58.979 --> 40:02.691

Blue team to ICU.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.987
Decided I'm not gonna kill you.

40:09.073 --> 40:09.907
Oh.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.200
[clears throat]

40:11.283 --> 40:12.118
Good.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.329
I was gonna ask.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.040
There must have been some kind
of power struggle back and forth

40:18.124 --> 40:19.792
when all that was going down.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.003
Who knows where
the order came from, right?

40:24.338 --> 40:26.257
Well. At least it's settled now.

40:28.050 --> 40:28.884
Still...

40:30.428 --> 40:31.929
must have been hard for you.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.480
Thanks for the lift.

It's the middle of the night.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.677
It won't come out.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.680
I mean, you'd think...

41:15.681 --> 41:17.516
they'd probably clean up
something like this.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.061
All those people here, every one
of them capable of holding a mop.

41:22.104 --> 41:25.316
Nah, they-- they're just gonna leave
a giant blood stain

41:25.399 --> 41:28.402
and a business card with a number
of a cleaning service.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.613
I'm surprised they took away
the dead body.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.115
I'm sorry that you had to go through that.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.869
It was a John Doe, by the way.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.622
Which I found fascinating.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.583
Not just no ID, no record at all.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.795
But you probably already knew that.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.800
Ray's a heck of a nice guy.

41:51.884 --> 41:52.968
Here, let me help you.

41:53.052 --> 41:55.179
Nah, I got it.
I'm-- I'm trying, uh--

41:55.262 --> 41:56.514
I'm trying baking soda.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.141
You know, the good news is,

41:59.225 --> 42:01.435
apparently the Indian lady
that lives next door,

42:01.519 --> 42:03.854
whose name I never knew,

42:03.938 --> 42:05.564
told an Officer Boyd...

42:06.649 --> 42:08.692
whose name I do remember
for some reason--

42:08.776 --> 42:10.986
that the person that came
into her apartment

42:11.070 --> 42:15.199
was a-- a stocky bald man
with a thick Canadian accent.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.162
Those Canadians, man.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.790
You gotta watch out.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.292
But I'm sure you knew
all about that too.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.877
David. Hey. Stop.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.797
Now all I have to do
is make myself available

42:29.880 --> 42:31.674
for future questioning,
whatever that means.

42:31.757 --> 42:32.591
That's good.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.301
No, that's-- it's wonderful.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.226
[Marcy] Can I do anything?

42:42.935 --> 42:44.228
Can I make you some tea?

42:46.397 --> 42:47.398
Um...

42:48.399 --> 42:50.401
You know,
I've had about 57 cups.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.695
I-I'm-- I'm a little wired.

42:56.991 --> 42:57.992
What can I do?

43:02.413 --> 43:03.539
This is nice.

43:08.210 --> 43:11.338
Why don't you take the bed tonight?
I'll take the couch. Okay?

43:13.215 --> 43:14.925
You know, I think I will tonight.

43:15.801 --> 43:17.011
I'm really tired.

43:18.804 --> 43:19.638
Okay.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.309
So, how was work?

43:23.851 --> 43:26.604
[classical music playing on stereo]

43:30.816 --> 43:31.817
[beeps]
