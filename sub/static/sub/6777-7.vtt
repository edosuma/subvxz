DUMP 'EM OUT ?

04:46.550 --> 04:48.017

04:59.330 --> 05:01.298
ARTHUR,

05:01.400 --> 05:04.324
YOU ACTUALLY
WROTE IT YOURSELF ?

05:04.430 --> 05:05.567
NOT EXACTLY.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.888
YOU ARE SO
MULTIFACETED.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.763
NOT REALLY.

05:09.870 --> 05:13.306
IT'S JUST A THEME BY DEBUSSY,
BUT I'VE DEVELOPED IT, SOMEWHAT.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.230
PUT A DRUM BEAT
UNDERNEATH IT.

05:15.340 --> 05:18.878
JUST FOR FUN, IT'S...
IT'S NOTHING MUCH.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.845
ARTHUR,
THAT'S AMAZING.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.418
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.249
ANYBODY COULD DO IT.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.556
NO, IT REALLY IS.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.480
YOU'RE A VERY
TALENTED YOUNG MAN.

05:28.590 --> 05:32.287
WHERE'S THE BUTI'ON
TO MAKE IT PLAY AGAIN ?

05:32.400 --> 05:35.289
I LOVE THAT LITTLE TUNE,
IT'S SO HAUNTING.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.265
ACTUALLY, RUTH,
I NEED TO GET GOING.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.667
SO SOON ?

05:38.770 --> 05:41.034
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
TAKE A RUN THIS MORNING.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.630
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU RAN, ARTHUR.

05:42.740 --> 05:46.608
I HAVEN'T EVER
BEFORE, ACTUALLY,

05:46.710 --> 05:48.575
BUT I THOUGHT
I MIGHT GIVE IT A TRY.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.172
I SEEM TO HAVE GAINED
SOME WEIGHT LATELY.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.975
BUT YOU LOOK FINE.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.672
THANK YOU.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.248
PEOPLE AND THEIR
WEIGHT NOWADAYS.

05:58.350 --> 05:59.908
IT'S SUCH
A STRANGE FASCINATION.

06:00.020 --> 06:03.080
I SEE YOU ALL THE TIME AROUND
THE HOUSE AND YOU LOOK FINE,

06:03.190 --> 06:05.886
JUST FINE.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.154
THANK YOU.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.522
WELL, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.861
BUT TELL ME,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO RUN ?

06:13.970 --> 06:15.130
PARDON ME ?

06:15.240 --> 06:16.366
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO RUN ?

06:16.470 --> 06:18.529
OH, PAN PACIFIC PARK.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.733
PAN PACIFIC PARK,
BY THE TAR PITS ?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.842
YES, THEY HAVE
A LITTLE PATH THERE,

06:22.950 --> 06:24.406
FOR RUNNING.

06:24.510 --> 06:29.243
OH, WELL THAT'S
PERFECT FOR YOU, THEN.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.385
GOOD, WELL...

06:30.490 --> 06:31.809
HAVE FUN.

06:31.920 --> 06:36.311
AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING
YOUR MUSIC WITH ME, ARTHUR.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.695
IT'S VERY RHYTHMIC.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.097
OKAY, SO LONG.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.007
( soft music playing )

07:27.210 --> 07:30.043
FUCK.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.243
Hey, listen, Lis,
I've got some bad news.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.942
Brenda's clad died.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.119
WHAT ?

07:35.220 --> 07:36.744
Brenda's father died.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.647
OH, SHIT !

07:38.750 --> 07:40.581
Yeah.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.419
I WAS WONDERING IF
IT WOULD BE OKAY WITH YOU IF--

07:42.530 --> 07:44.054
( slurping )

07:44.160 --> 07:46.424
COULD YOU MAKE A LITTLE
MORE NOISE WITH THAT STRAW,

07:46.530 --> 07:47.758
I CAN STILL
HEAR MYSELF THINK.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.191
FUNNY.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.460
WHAT ?

07:50.570 --> 07:53.289
I WAS WONDERING IF
IT WOULD BE OKAY WITH YOU

07:53.400 --> 07:54.492
IF I WENT TO
HIS FUNERAL.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.033
OF COURSE !

07:56.140 --> 07:58.438
IT'S JUST, SHE WAS WITH ME
WHEN MY FATHER DIED,

07:58.540 --> 08:00.599
IT FEELS LIKE I SHOULD
CHECK IN WITH HER, AT LEAST.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.507
THEN GO,
YOU TOTALLY SHOULD !

08:02.610 --> 08:04.669
ARE YOU SURE ?

08:04.780 --> 08:05.769
Yeah !

08:05.880 --> 08:07.017
OKAY.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.849
So you'll leave Maya
with your mom ?

08:08.950 --> 08:10.349
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:10.450 --> 08:12.486
JUST TELL HER NOT TO
GIVE HER ANY MORE CHEESE,

08:12.590 --> 08:14.080
BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY
A LITTLE CONSTIPATED.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.214
Gotcha.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.526
AND TELL HER TO
GO EASY ON THE NUK,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.029
I don't want her
to get buck teeth.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.028
I LOVE YOU.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.256
I love you too.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.156
YOU HAVING FUN ?

08:21.260 --> 08:22.295
NOT YET.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.220
B'bye.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.024
BYE.

08:26.430 --> 08:27.294
BRENDA'S DAD DIED ?

08:27.400 --> 08:28.469
YEAH.

08:28.570 --> 08:29.969
THAT SUCKS.

08:30.070 --> 08:33.005
YEAH, AND THE FUNERAL'S
UP IN MALIBU IN A FEW HOURS.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.101
WHERE'S MOM ?

08:35.210 --> 08:36.746
I DON'T KNOW.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.341
SHE JUST LEFT, SAID SHE NEEDED
A NEW GARDENING HAT ?

08:39.450 --> 08:41.577
SHE SEEMED
KINDA WEIRD.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.478
HOW CAN YOU TELL
WHEN MOM'S WEIRD ?

08:44.590 --> 08:46.649
GOOD POINT.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.058
SO HOW ABOUT IT, CAN YOU
WATCH MAYA FOR ME TODAY ?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.252
20 BUCKS.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.123
OH, I CAN'T.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.788
WHY NOT ?

08:53.900 --> 08:56.221
RUSSELL AND I ARE
GOING TO THE ART STORE.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.820
CLAIRE !

08:57.930 --> 08:58.692
NATE !

08:58.800 --> 09:00.529
YOU KNOW,
THIS ISN'T THE MATRIX.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.494
LIKE, THE REST OF US,
WHO DON'T HAVE BABIES ?

09:02.610 --> 09:04.828
WE'RE REAL.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.508
WATCH MY BABY,
WATCH MY BABY.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.100
JESUS CHRIST.

09:09.210 --> 09:12.304
FUCK.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.672
FUCK !

09:14.780 --> 09:16.008
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

09:16.120 --> 09:16.939
NOTHING.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.938
I THOUGHT I COULD
DROP MAYA OFF

09:19.050 --> 09:22.019
WITH TODD AND DANA'S NANNY
FOR A WHILE, BUT I GUESS NOT.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.929
YOU SHOULD GIVE
VANESSA A CALL.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.429
VANESSA ?

09:25.530 --> 09:27.225
YEAH, SHE'S AT HOME
WITH THE BOYS TODAY.

09:27.330 --> 09:28.524
YOU THINK SHE'D BE
OKAY WITH IT ?

09:28.630 --> 09:29.892
OF COURSE,
SHE LOVES BABIES.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.524
I'D ONLY BE
A COUPLE HOURS,

09:31.630 --> 09:32.938
I'D DROP HER OFF,
PICK HER UP--

09:33.040 --> 09:34.439
DO IT!

09:34.540 --> 09:35.495
ALRIGHT, THAN KS.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.931
YOU'LL HAVE
TO PAY HER.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.030
WELL, SURE.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.573
GREAT.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.045
KEITH !

09:44.150 --> 09:46.914
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT REALLY
PLANNING ON WEARING THAT.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.375
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH IT ?

09:49.480 --> 09:50.742
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH IT ?

09:50.850 --> 09:52.442
IT COVERS UP ALL
YOUR GOOD, BIG, PARTS.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.383
MY GOOD, BIG, PARTS.

09:55.490 --> 09:56.627
YEAH, TAKE THAT...

09:56.730 --> 09:58.686
THING OFF AND GO PUT ON
SOMETHING BETTER.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.348
MAYBE YOUR SILVER
D-K-N-Y T-SHIRT.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.623
IS THIS A BRUNCH
OR A FASHION SHOW ?

10:03.730 --> 10:06.369
I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE JEALOUS
OF MY BEAUTIFUL BOYFRIEND,

10:06.470 --> 10:07.869
IS THAT OKAY ?

10:07.970 --> 10:10.165
I HAVE, LIKE, TWO THINGS
GOING FOR ME IN THIS WORLD

10:10.270 --> 10:11.305
AND YOU'RE
ONE OF THEM.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.365
WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE ?

10:12.470 --> 10:14.370
ALRIGHT, ONE.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.369
ANYWAY, YOU KNEW
THAT SWEATSHIRT

10:17.480 --> 10:19.004
WAS A BAD IDEA
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON.

10:19.110 --> 10:19.940
I GUESS.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.870
YOU'RE SO WILLFUL
SOMETIMES.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.288
OH YEAH ?

10:23.390 --> 10:24.743
YEAH.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.442
OR WE COULD JUST
SKIP THE BRUNCH,

10:26.550 --> 10:27.756
STAY HERE,

10:27.860 --> 10:29.657
AND I COULD BE WILLFUL
ALL AFTERNOON.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.321
YOU MAKE A VERY
STRONG CASE.

10:33.430 --> 10:36.593
MM, BUT I REALLY
WANT A MIMOSA.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.292
I'M SORRY.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.836
YOUR LOSS.

11:01.060 --> 11:04.826
( coughing )

11:06.290 --> 11:08.258
( blowing nose )

11:14.540 --> 11:17.236
UP WE GO.

11:29.650 --> 11:30.548
HI.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.117
HI, HEY.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.812
IT'S SO COOL YOU'RE LEAVING
THE BABY FOR A WHILE.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.854
YOU'RE SURE
IT'S ALRIGHT ?

11:35.960 --> 11:36.881
YEAH, IT'S PERFECT,
IT'S PERFECT.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.651
IT BREAKS UP
THE DAY.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.352
WHAT'S THAT SMELL ?

11:40.460 --> 11:41.950
OH, THAT'S PUDDING.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.791
I TRIED TO MAKE RICE PUDDING,
BUT THAT MILK WAS WEIRD.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.936
OH, COME ON IN.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.032
THE PLACE IS
A TOTAL MESS.

11:51.140 --> 11:54.177
I WAS JUST STARTING
TO CLEAN WHEN YOU CALLED.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.430
IT'S SO HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH TWO KIDS, YOU KNOW ?

11:56.540 --> 11:58.508
YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE.

11:58.610 --> 12:00.111
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.745
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE
HAVING TWO KIDS

12:02.850 --> 12:04.818
WOULD JUST BE
TWICE AS HARD,

12:04.920 --> 12:08.219
BUT IT'S, LIKE, THREE TIMES
OR FOUR TIMES AS MUCH TO DO,

12:08.320 --> 12:11.858
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, THE MATH,

12:11.960 --> 12:13.689
BUT SOMEHOW
IT ALL ADDS UP.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.688
OF COURSE.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.062
YEAH.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.024
BUT YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU JUST HAVE ONE,

12:19.130 --> 12:20.961
AND LISA'S
SUCH A GOOD MOM,

12:21.070 --> 12:23.163
I BETCHA SHE DOES
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

12:23.270 --> 12:24.703
SHE'S UH...

12:24.810 --> 12:26.459
GOOD, YEAH.

12:26.570 --> 12:29.733
BECAUSE I GET
SO TIRED SOMETIMES,
I COULD ALMOST CRY.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.843
GOD, WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO BARNEY ?

12:33.950 --> 12:35.770
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
IT WAS JUST BARN EY ?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.781
THINGS WERE
SIMPLER THEN.

12:38.890 --> 12:41.358
LET ME JUST GO
PUT THIS STUFF DOWN

12:41.460 --> 12:45.055
AND THEN I'LL TAKE HER
OFF YOUR HANDS, OKAY ?

12:46.230 --> 12:49.427
(crying )

12:49.530 --> 12:51.725
OH MAN, I COULD SO GO
TOTALLY BROKE IN THIS PLACE.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.196
EVERY TIME
I COME HERE,

12:54.300 --> 12:56.689
I FEEL LIKE AUGUSTUS GLOOP
IN THE CHOCOLATE ROOM.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.734
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT ?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.330
OH YEAH.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.772
WHEN I WAS A KID,
THOSE OOMPA-LOOMPAS
USED TO FREAK ME OUT.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.279
ME TOO.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.143
WHENEVER IT WAS ON,
MY MOM WOULD MAKE US WATCH IT,

13:07.250 --> 13:10.845
AND I'D CRY EVERY TIME, AND IT
WAS LIKE SHE DIDN'T EVEN CARE.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.611
PARENTS ARE FREAKS.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.709
WORD.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.685
I FELT SO BAD
FOR CHARLIE,

13:15.790 --> 13:18.088
HE WAS SO POOR.

13:18.190 --> 13:21.227
THAT MOVIE WAS
A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.666
WHAT ?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.260
IT'S COBALT BLUE.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.964
JUST THINK,

13:28.070 --> 13:30.561
THIS IS THE NATURAL
PART OF THE EARTH

13:30.670 --> 13:31.739
THAT'S THIS COLOR BLUE.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.376
LIKE OLIVIER SAID.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.607
YEAH,
IT'S AN ELEMENT !

13:35.710 --> 13:37.143
AND YOU JUST LIKE
ADD OIL TO IT

13:37.250 --> 13:38.899
AND YOU CAN MAKE
PICTURES WITH IT,

13:39.010 --> 13:40.841
IT'S SO LIKE CAVE-PEOPLE-Y,
I LOVE IT.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.418
YOU SHOULD BUY IT.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.215
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.914
I'M NOT EVEN REALLY A PAINTER,
I'M NOT GONNA SPEND WHAT--

13:48.020 --> 13:51.786
50 BUCKS ON SOME
LITTLE TUBE OF PAINT !

13:51.890 --> 13:54.290
IF I'M GONNA PAINT,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.493
I'LL JUST BUY THE CHEAP
FIVE-DOLLAR SHIT.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.794
NO, YOU SHOULD GET IT.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.197
NO WAY !

13:59.300 --> 14:00.392
NO, GET IT !

14:00.500 --> 14:01.899
NO!

14:02.000 --> 14:03.308
I'LL GET IT
FOR YOU !

14:03.410 --> 14:04.832
NO, I DON'T NEED IT.

14:04.940 --> 14:05.838
COME ON !

14:05.940 --> 14:07.305
GET IT.

14:07.410 --> 14:08.775
NO!

14:08.880 --> 14:10.541
OKAY.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.074
JESUS, SORRY.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.280
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK HERE ?

14:19.390 --> 14:21.483
UH, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.126
WHAT'S UP
WITH VAN ESSA ?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.788
NOTHING.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.221
ARE YOU SURE ?

14:26.330 --> 14:28.457
UH, YEAH.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.462
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN DOWN
IN THE DUMPS SINCE HER MOM DIED,

14:32.570 --> 14:33.935
BUT OTHER
THAN THAT, WHY ?

14:34.040 --> 14:37.965
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, RICO,
I GOT THERE, AND UH...

14:38.070 --> 14:40.402
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PUT THIS,

14:40.510 --> 14:43.206
BUT SHE HAD THIS REALLY
INTENSE ENERGY GOING ON.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.107
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD'VE LEFT MAYA THERE.

14:45.210 --> 14:49.044
YOU DIDN'T FEEL SAFE
LEAVING MAYA AT MY HOUSE ?

14:49.150 --> 14:50.412
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.839
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY ?

14:51.950 --> 14:53.451
HELLO, GENTLEMEN.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.211
HEY, LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO COME BACK TO WORK.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.550
DO YOU STILL NEED SOMEONE
TO WATCH MAYA TODAY ?

14:58.660 --> 15:00.457
UMM...

15:00.560 --> 15:02.050
BECAUSE
I LOVE INFANTS.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.628
THEY SMELL SO SWEET.

15:04.730 --> 15:07.130
NO, ARTHUR,
I'M OKAY.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.959
I'M GONNA JUST TAKE HER
WITH ME, BUT THANKS.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.833
NEVER HESITATE TO ASK.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.908
I USED TO WATCH
MY COUSINS ALL THE TIME,

15:14.010 --> 15:15.637
AND THEY WERE MORMONS.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.799
MORMONS.

15:17.910 --> 15:21.038
YEAH.

15:21.150 --> 15:24.642
OKAY, I'M GONNA WASH UP
AND GET TO WORK.

15:27.090 --> 15:28.717
LISTEN, RICO,
I'M SORRY, MAN.

15:28.820 --> 15:29.957
I DON'T MEAN TO--

15:30.060 --> 15:31.220
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE, NATE.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.958
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO YOU A FAVOR.

15:34.060 --> 15:37.325
WELL, THAN KS.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.160
NO, THANK YOU.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.930
SO, LET IT BE SAID OF ME
WHEN I AM GONE

15:47.040 --> 15:51.306
HE LIVED BY THE LIGHT
OF THE TEN THOUSAND THINGS.

15:51.410 --> 15:56.541
HIS HEART WITH STARRY SPARKS
WAS THUS SUSTAINED,

15:56.650 --> 15:59.813
AND LOVE AND MEANING

15:59.920 --> 16:03.083
PASSED THROUGH HIM
AND FLED

16:03.190 --> 16:06.580
TO CARRY JOY
FROM DARK TO DARK

16:06.690 --> 16:09.022
WAS JOY ENOUGH FOR HIM.

16:09.130 --> 16:12.520
THE MAN IS DEAD.

16:12.630 --> 16:16.396
( laughing )

16:47.170 --> 16:49.695
I JUST HAVE
SOME PICTURES.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.341
THIS FIRST ONE IS OF DAD
AND ME IN THE BACKYARD,

16:58.450 --> 17:02.671
STANDING NEXT
TO MY HOLE TO CHINA.

17:02.780 --> 17:07.080
I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD,

17:07.190 --> 17:09.283
TRYING TO DIG
A HOLE TO CHINA.

17:09.390 --> 17:13.724
HE NEVER EVER TOLD ME I COULDN'T
ACTUALLY GET TO CHINA,

17:13.830 --> 17:16.492
HE JUST...

17:16.600 --> 17:20.491
KEPT DIGGING WITH ME
UNTIL I GOT BORED.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.907
THAT WAS A GOOD DAY.

17:27.010 --> 17:29.604
THE SECOND ONE IS OF
THE WHOLE FAMILY

17:34.950 --> 17:37.384
THEY GAVE HIM
AN AWARD

17:37.490 --> 17:41.586
AND HE GOT UP THERE
AND MADE ALL THESE JOKES

17:41.690 --> 17:45.922
ABOUT JIMMY CARTER
NEEDING ADLERIAN THERAPY.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.294
( laughing )

17:48.400 --> 17:50.027
I DIDN'T GET THE JOKES,

17:50.130 --> 17:53.566
BUT I WAS PROUD
OF HIM THAT NIGHT.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.265
I WAS PROUD THAT
HE WAS MY DAD.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.609
THIS LAST ONE...

18:14.620 --> 18:17.088
COME ON, BILLY.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.666
IS JUST A REALLY
GOOD PICTURE.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.702
OH MY GOD !

18:39.810 --> 18:40.811
HEY!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.478
WELCOME TO MY HUMBLE
A-BAUDELAIRE !

18:42.580 --> 18:43.478
OH NEAT !

18:43.590 --> 18:45.342
I'M SORRY
WE'RE A LITTLE LATE.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.008
FUCK THAT, YOU GUYS
ARE THE CAVALRY,

18:47.120 --> 18:48.189
YOUR TIMING
IS PERFECT.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.951
KEITH, IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOU.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.880
THANKS FOR
HAVING US OVER.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.025
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

18:53.130 --> 18:54.358
THE PLEASURE'S
ALL MINE, RRR.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.167
HEY, EVERYBODY,
IT'S DAVID AND KEITH !

18:57.270 --> 18:58.760
( together)
HI !

18:58.870 --> 19:00.997
SO, COME ON IN,
COME ON IN.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.364
GRAB A MIMOSA,
HAVE SOME QUICHE.

19:03.470 --> 19:06.030
THAT QUICHE IS IN QUOTES,
BY THE WAY,

19:06.140 --> 19:07.277
I'M NOT
A TOTAL IDIOT.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.268
OH, JUST REMEMBER,
WHATEVER YOU DO,

19:09.380 --> 19:10.745
DON'T LOOK TRIXIE
IN THE EYE.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.703
WHO'S TRIXIE ?

19:11.810 --> 19:12.879
MY LITTLE POOPER DOG.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.414
YOU ARE MY LITTLE POOPER,
AREN'T YOU ?

19:15.520 --> 19:17.715
DON'T, DON'T
LOOK HER IN THE EYE,

19:17.820 --> 19:18.980
SHE'LL FREAK OUT
AND POOP !

19:19.090 --> 19:21.308
WE'RE TALKING SPRAYING POOP,
LIKE, DA-DA-DA !

19:21.420 --> 19:23.923
SERIOUSLY,
DON'T EVEN LOOK AT HER.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.019
YOU GOT IT.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.223
BY THE WAY,

19:27.330 --> 19:30.265
WE'RE PLAYING
"LEADING LADIES."

19:30.370 --> 19:32.292
BEST OF LUCK !

19:32.400 --> 19:35.096
DID HE JUST PUT
SOMETHING ON MY BACK ?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.634
NO, NO, IT'S A GAME.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.470
"LEADING LADIES", SEE,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.536
EVERYBODY HAS A LEADING LADY
ON THEIR BACK,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.301
AND YOU HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE

19:44.410 --> 19:45.900
BY ASKING
YES OR NO QUESTIONS.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.614
AM I THIS ?
AM I THAT ?

19:47.720 --> 19:51.019
COME ON, YOU CAN EITHER DECIDE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A ROTTEN TIME

19:51.120 --> 19:52.348
OR YOU CAN DECIDE
TO HAVE FUN.

19:52.450 --> 19:53.951
YOU SOUND LIKE
A CAMP COUNSELOR.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.449
ALRIGHT,
I'LL HAVE FUN.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.050
LET ME SEE
WHO YOU ARE.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.152
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.319
I HOPE THAT POEM
WAS SATISFACTORY, MARGARET.

20:03.430 --> 20:06.126
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
BERN LIKING IT.

20:06.230 --> 20:08.960
AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER
BERN THINKING

20:09.070 --> 20:11.004
YOU WERE AN
ABSOLUTE ASSHOLE.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.862
MOM,HILL.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.700
BILLY, YOUR UNCLE MARV IS HERE
FOR HIS OWN COMPLICATED REASONS,

20:15.810 --> 20:19.200
HE DESERVES TO HAVE
HIS OWN COMPLICATED EXPERIENCE.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.517
WELL NOW
THANK YOU, MARV.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.588
IT WAS A PERFECT POEM,
YOU DID YOUR DUTY.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.942
YOU CAN NOW GET
THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.450
SHH.

20:30.060 --> 20:30.958
BRENDA.

20:31.060 --> 20:31.958
SEE YA.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.322
BILLY.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.848
OH, HEY.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.860
HE NEVER FORGAVE YOUR FATHER
FOR BEING A SUCCESS.

20:38.970 --> 20:42.394
OR GIVING UP
HANUKKAH.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.637
NATE !

20:45.740 --> 20:46.638
HEY, MARGARET.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.198
I'M SO SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT BERN.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.449
I KNOW YOU MUST BE--

20:52.550 --> 20:54.745
OH PLEASE, NATE, DON'T GIVE ME
THAT FUNERAL HOME SHIT.

20:54.850 --> 20:55.874
COME ON NOW.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.174
DID BRENDA CALL YOU ?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.349
NO, SHE DIDN'T,
I READ IT IN THE PAPER.

20:59.450 --> 21:01.816
AND YOU JUST CAME HERE
UNDER YOUR OWN STEAM ?

21:01.920 --> 21:04.480
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

21:04.590 --> 21:08.299
AW, THAT'S SO STRANGE.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.725
HEY, BILLY.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.497
HEY.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.261
HEY.

21:15.370 --> 21:18.760
WE'RE GOING TO BE OVER
AT THE CONDO LATER.

21:18.870 --> 21:21.100
JUST THE FAMILY,
JUST A LITTLE DINNER.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.677
I THINK,
RIGHT, BILLY ?

21:22.780 --> 21:24.008
YES, MOTHER,
IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.805
TRAGEDY.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.549
IT'S THE ONE THING OUR CHILDREN
ARE REALLY GOOD AT.

21:28.650 --> 21:32.211
I MEAN
"MY CHILDREN."

21:32.320 --> 21:34.880
IT'S OKAY, MOM.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.685
SO CAN YOU JOIN US ?

21:36.790 --> 21:39.350
UH, THANKS,

21:39.460 --> 21:40.893
BUT I PROBABLY NEED
TO GET BACK TO THE HOUSE.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.195
YOU CAN STICK AROUND
FOR A LITTLE BIT, THOUGH, HUH ?

21:43.300 --> 21:44.562
YEAH, SURE.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.661
COME ON, MOM,
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, HUH ?

21:46.770 --> 21:48.897
DON'T LEAVE.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.968
I WON'T, I WON'T.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.812
OH, ARTHUR, HI !

22:09.860 --> 22:11.054
HI, RUTH.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.048
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
STALKING ME THIS MORNING ?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.651
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

22:15.760 --> 22:16.795
OH, PLEASE.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.791
WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN THE C.I.A.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.367
OR THE MOONIES ?!

22:23.470 --> 22:26.109
OR WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE ACTUAL FUCKING MOON

22:26.210 --> 22:28.872
AND MIND YOUR OWN
MOON BUSINESS,

22:28.980 --> 22:31.904
YOU FREAK !

22:32.010 --> 22:33.079
HI, RUTH.

22:33.180 --> 22:34.340
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD MORNING ?

22:34.450 --> 22:38.784
OH, YES, ARTHUR,
THANK YOU, IT WAS...

22:38.890 --> 22:40.380
WONDERFUL.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.855
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ASKING.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.020
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
I HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS,

22:45.130 --> 22:47.894
MY HAIR FEELS FUNNY.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.764
OKAY.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.690
BYE.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.338
KEITH SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF LAUGHS.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.771
OH, STOP.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.201
HE'S JUST A LITTLE
OUT OF HIS ELEMENT, RIGHT ?

23:03.310 --> 23:04.277
COMPLETELY.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.369
I LOVE THAT
HE EVEN CAME

23:05.480 --> 23:07.175
THIS IS SO NOT
HIS TYPE OF THING.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.645
AND WHAT'S HIS
TYPE OF THING ?

23:08.750 --> 23:12.481
I DON'T KNOW, HE LIKES
TO COOK AND WORK OUT.

23:12.590 --> 23:13.716
HE LOVES OLD MOVIES,

23:13.820 --> 23:15.378
HE'S PROBABLY DOING
VERY WELL OVER THERE.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.912
SO, TELL ME,
AM I A "BLACK WIDOW" ?

23:17.020 --> 23:19.159
I DON'T KNOW.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.319
AM I KNOWN FOR
MY FIGURE OR MY FACE ?

23:21.430 --> 23:24.160
TURN AROUND, LET ME
SEE THIS THING AGAIN.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.206
I DON'T KNOW.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.870
AM I AN OSCAR WINNER ?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.106
I DON'T KNOW.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.507
AM I BLONDE ?

23:36.610 --> 23:38.874
I DON'T KNOW.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.914
ARE YOU REALLY GAY ?

23:41.020 --> 23:43.909
YEAH, I'M REALLY GAY.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.114
LINDA, GODDAMNIT !

23:47.220 --> 23:49.688
DON'T LOOK TRIXIE
IN THE EYE !

23:56.060 --> 23:58.722
HEY.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.839
BABY'S FIRST FUNERAL ?

24:02.940 --> 24:04.202
HARDLY.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.368
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

24:05.470 --> 24:08.678
HOW'RE YOU
HOLDING UP ?

24:08.780 --> 24:13.376
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT ME
OR MY DEAD FATHER.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.869
FOR 30 SECONDS,
ANYWAY.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.811
OKAY.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.084
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ?

24:24.560 --> 24:28.690
TELL ME SOMETHING
ABOUT MAYA.

24:32.230 --> 24:33.322
OH.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.694
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.928
OH, SHE DISCOVERED
THE TELEPHONE THE OTHER DAY,

24:39.040 --> 24:42.373
IT'S BECOME, LIKE,
HER FAVORITE NEW TOY.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.333
YEAH ?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.976
YEAH.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.900
SHE ACCIDENTALLY SPEED-DIALED MY
NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE YESTERDAY

24:47.010 --> 24:49.547
AND FOR TWO MINUTES,
THE NURSE THOUGHT

24:49.650 --> 24:51.811
SHE HAD A STROKE VICTIM
ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.680
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAME.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.728
OF COURSE I CAME.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.197
HEY, VAN ESSA ?

25:07.300 --> 25:08.767
Yeah ?

25:08.870 --> 25:13.000
HEY, I JUST TALKED TO NATE
AND HE TOLD ME HE CAME BY ?

25:13.110 --> 25:14.737
YEAH, HE DID.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.273
And so what happened ?

25:16.380 --> 25:17.779
I DON'T KNOW !

25:17.880 --> 25:19.745
LISTEN, DON'T TELL HIM
I SAID THIS, BABY,

25:19.850 --> 25:21.670
BUT HE SEEMED
KINDA OUT OF IT.

25:21.780 --> 25:25.887
YOU SURE NOTHING ELSE
WAS THE MATTER.

25:25.990 --> 25:27.753
RICO, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW PARANOID WE WERE,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.384
THAT FIRST YEAR
WITH JULIO ?

25:29.490 --> 25:30.821
WE WOULDN'T LEAVE HIM
WITH ANYBODY.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.454
BABY, THAT'S JUST
THE WAY NEW PARENTS ARE.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.552
SO, UM...

25:35.660 --> 25:38.220
SO, YOU'RE
FEELING OKAY ?

25:38.330 --> 25:41.231
YEAH, I FEEL FINE.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.399
You're sure ?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.900
YEAH, RICO,
JUST COME HOME, OKAY ?

25:46.010 --> 25:48.831
BECAUSE THE KIDS, THEY'RE JUST
BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.944
Alright, alright,
I'll be home soon.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.210
OKAY.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.049
BYE.
Okay, b'bye.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.456
IT WAS THREE MONTHS FROM
THE DAY THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM

26:04.560 --> 26:06.289
HE HAD IT
TO THE DAY HE DIED.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.153
THREE MONTHS.

26:08.260 --> 26:11.161
STOMACH CANCER'S
FAST THAT WAY.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.467
GASTRIC CANCER IS ACTUALLY
THE TECHNICAL TERM.

26:14.570 --> 26:16.629
IT WAS EVERYWHERE,

26:16.740 --> 26:19.504
IT WAS ALL UP AND DOWN
HIS ALIMENTARY CANAL.

26:19.610 --> 26:22.773
IT WAS FUN LEARNING
ALL THE JARGON.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.871
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.744
I NEVER EVEN KNEW I HAD
A MEDULLA OBLONGATA,

26:27.850 --> 26:29.670
NOW I COULD
DRAW IT FOR YOU.

26:29.780 --> 26:34.080
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING
ELSE IN MY HEAD.

26:38.490 --> 26:39.923
DO YOU HAVE A SCAR ?

26:40.030 --> 26:43.352
IS THAT
A RHETORICAL QUESTION ?

26:43.460 --> 26:47.794
CAN I SEE IT ?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.963
SURE.

26:52.470 --> 26:54.279
IT'S UH...

27:02.480 --> 27:04.710
WOW.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.188
BREN, IT'S OKAY.

27:13.290 --> 27:14.188
( sobbing )

27:14.300 --> 27:16.222
I'M OKAY.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.524
YEAH, I KNOW.

27:17.630 --> 27:21.191
I'M AT MY FATHER'S FUNERAL,
I'M EMOTIONAL.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.769
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE PLACE

27:30.880 --> 27:32.472
WHERE WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED.

27:32.580 --> 27:35.140
I KNOW.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.621
HAS EVERY "LEADING LADY"
IN THE ROOM FOUND HERSELF YET ?

27:45.730 --> 27:47.698
I'M CHRISTY MACNICHOL,

27:47.800 --> 27:49.495
BUT I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS
BEEN PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.022
I'M MADONNA.

27:51.130 --> 27:52.324
OF COURSE.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.637
KEITH DOESN'T
KNOW WHO HE IS !

27:54.740 --> 27:56.560
OH REALLY !

27:56.670 --> 27:58.661
SHIT.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.067
GET OVER HERE !

28:00.170 --> 28:02.331
GET OVER HERE !

28:07.150 --> 28:11.280
OKAY, OKAY.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.279
GO AHEAD AND ASK US HOWEVER
MANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT,

28:14.390 --> 28:15.459
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.357
ALRIGHT, AM I
DEAD OR ALIVE ?

28:17.460 --> 28:18.859
YOU'RE ALIVE,
I THINK.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.484
AM I BLONDE
OR BRUNETTE ?

28:20.590 --> 28:22.091
BRUNETTE.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.792
I THINK YOU WERE BLONDE FOR
A WHILE BUT IT WAS SO WRONG.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.868
KEITH, WE SAW HER
AT CHALET GOURMET
WITH BEN STILLER.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.426
I REMEMBER
BEN STILLER.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.293
COME ON,
YOU KNOW THIS.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.833
HE KNOWS THIS !

28:30.940 --> 28:32.259
YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE
WALKED OUT ON "TIME CODE" ?

28:32.370 --> 28:33.234
YEAH ?

28:33.340 --> 28:34.568
SHE WAS IN THAT !

28:34.680 --> 28:35.772
"MICKEY BLUE EYES" ?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.108
"BASIC INSTINCT " ?

28:37.210 --> 28:38.302
"WATERWORLD" ?

28:38.410 --> 28:39.308
YES !

28:39.410 --> 28:40.172
"WATERWORLD"

28:40.280 --> 28:42.419
"WATERWORLD" !

28:42.520 --> 28:44.215
"WATERWORLD" !

28:44.320 --> 28:45.389
"WATERWORLD"

28:45.490 --> 28:50.712
( shouting )
"WATERWORLD !"

28:53.860 --> 28:55.293
I HAVE NO IDEA !

28:55.400 --> 28:59.393
IF THE MAN DOESN'T KNOW,
THE MAN DOESN'T KNOW.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.737
JEANNE TRIPPLEHORN.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.331
WHO WANTS
A MARGARITA ?

29:07.410 --> 29:10.038
IT'S A STUPID GAME,
ANYWAY.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.342
WATCHING HIM DIE...

29:16.450 --> 29:18.008
YEAH ?

29:18.120 --> 29:22.011
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING SOMEBODY
GET WASHED OUT TO SEA,

29:22.120 --> 29:23.781
ONLY THEY'RE SITTING
RIGHT THERE IN BED.

29:23.890 --> 29:27.621
A WAVE COMES,
TAKES THEM A LITTLE AWAY

29:27.730 --> 29:31.291
ANOTHER WAVE COMES,
TAKES THEM A LITTLE AWAY,

29:31.400 --> 29:35.439
EVERY WAVE IS A DAY,
AND LITTLE BY LITTLE,

29:35.540 --> 29:37.633
OFF THEY...

29:37.740 --> 29:41.369
OFF THEY GO.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.242
CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING ?

29:49.350 --> 29:51.818
SURE.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.412
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU
IN A WEIRD POSITION.

29:55.520 --> 29:59.251
I'M ALREADY
IN A WEIRD POSITION.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.523
I LIVE MY WHOLE LIFE
IN A WEIRD POSITION.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.259
I'VE MISSED YOU...

30:05.370 --> 30:07.930
THROUGH THIS.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.075
I'VE MISSED YOU TOO.

30:20.010 --> 30:22.240
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T KNOW

30:22.350 --> 30:23.942
HOW MUCH BEING
WITH YOU CHANGED ME,

30:24.050 --> 30:28.953
HOW MUCH YOU WOKE ME UP,
AS A PERSON.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.999
I WOULDN'T BE WHO I AM TODAY
IF I'D NEVER MET YOU.

30:37.630 --> 30:40.690
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T FLOSS
EVERY DAY, THAT'S FOR SURE.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.461
YOU'RE KEEPING UP
WITH THAT ?

30:42.570 --> 30:44.162
AFTER EVERY MEAL.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.169
YOU CHANGED ME, TOO.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.113
YEAH, HOW SO ?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.281
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I'VE LOST,

31:03.390 --> 31:06.382
WHERE IT REALLY
COST ME SOMETHING.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.425
THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T
BEEN WITH ANYONE SINCE.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.499
NOBODY ?

31:12.600 --> 31:18.334
IT'S TOO SCARY, THE THOUGHT
OF SCREWING IT ALL UP AGAIN.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.937
YEAH, YOU'LL
FINDOMEBODY.

31:22.040 --> 31:25.305
THAT IS SO
NOT THE ANSWER.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.787
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK ?

31:32.890 --> 31:33.959
ABOUT WHAT ?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.379
I DON'T KNOW, LIFE.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.708
WHAT ?

31:37.820 --> 31:40.618
I THINK IT'S ALL
ABOUT TIMING.

31:40.730 --> 31:45.360
I THINK TIMING
IS EVERYTHING.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.168
I THINK YOU
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

31:59.710 --> 32:03.168
( seagulls

32:06.820 --> 32:08.811
WHAT'S IN HERE ?

32:08.920 --> 32:11.252
JUST OPEN IT.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.487
AM I FORGETTING SOME WEIRD
ANNIVERSARY OR SOMETHING ?

32:13.590 --> 32:19.028
LIKE OUR 17-WEEK ANNIVERSARY
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

32:20.800 --> 32:23.132
OH MY GOD,
YOU'RE SUCH A FREAK.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.798
WHEN DID YOU
EVEN GET THIS ?

32:24.910 --> 32:26.366
MAGIC.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.973
WHAT AM I EVEN
GONNA DO WITH THIS ?

32:29.080 --> 32:31.071
YOU DUMB-ASS,
THIS COST 50 BUCKS !

32:31.180 --> 32:32.647
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO WITH IT.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.241
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HAVE IT.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.989
I HAVE A THEORY THAT
EVERY NOW AND THEN

32:40.090 --> 32:43.014
A PERSON SHOULD GET WHAT
THEY WANT WHEN THEY WANT IT.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.623
IT KEEPS YOU
OPTIMISTIC.

32:45.730 --> 32:46.958
THAT'S A GOOD THEORY,

32:47.060 --> 32:48.721
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN OPTIMISTIC, SO.

32:48.830 --> 32:52.220
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S TIME TO START.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.639
THIS WAS A LOT OF MONEY,
THOUGH, RUSSELL.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.732
SO WHAT ?

32:59.410 --> 33:04.746
MONEY ONLY FUCKS UP ART,
ANYWAY, RIGHT ?

33:08.380 --> 33:12.180
AND I'D RATHER BE POOR,
AND SEE YOU HAPPY.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.130
WHAT ?

33:29.540 --> 33:32.202
NOTHING.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.902
I HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL NOW, RIGHT ?

33:34.010 --> 33:35.637
NO.

33:37.040 --> 33:37.972
NO.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.377
YES, I DO.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.914
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL,
I DON'T GET TOO USED TO THIS.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.717
NO, GO AHEAD.

33:45.820 --> 33:48.755
GET USED TO IT.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.682
I DARE YA.

33:59.300 --> 34:02.189
DO YOU EVER TALK
TO OLIVIER ABOUT US ?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.392
NO.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.263
YOU ?

34:05.370 --> 34:06.064
NO.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.070
WHY NOT ?

34:08.180 --> 34:10.933
NO REASON,
I GUESS IT...

34:11.040 --> 34:14.419
I GUESS I JUST WANT
THERE TO BE CERTAIN THINGS

34:14.520 --> 34:16.545
THAT ARE JUST OURS,
YOU KNOW.

34:16.650 --> 34:19.483
THIS IS JUST OURS.

34:19.590 --> 34:22.286
COOL.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.287

OH, HELLO, DEAR !

35:14.940 --> 35:16.373
I CAN SEE THAT.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.277
ARTHUR'S REALLY
QUITE TALENTED.

35:18.380 --> 35:20.302
YOU PROBABLY
DON'T KNOW IT,

35:20.410 --> 35:22.310
BUT HE WRITES HIS OWN
COMPUTERIZED MUSIC

35:22.420 --> 35:24.217
AND HE PLAYS
THE OLD SONGS, TOO !

35:24.320 --> 35:26.083
THAT'S GREAT.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.214
ISN'T IT ?

35:27.320 --> 35:28.685
IT'S SO UNEXPECT ED.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.849
ARTHUR RUNS TOO.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.029
YOU TWO SHOULD
RUN TOGETHER.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.849
MAYBE WE WILL
SOMETIME.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.019
HE USED TO PLAY
AS AN ACCOMPANIST

35:37.130 --> 35:38.495
FOR A BALLET COMPANY.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.521
YEAH, LOOK, MOM.

35:39.630 --> 35:40.369
I'M GONNA HEAD HOME.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.789

35:41.900 --> 35:43.299

A LITTLE OUT OF IT THIS MORNING.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.936
NO, I'M WONDERFUL,

35:45.040 --> 35:46.860
BUT THANK YOU
FOR BEING CONCERNED.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.609
HOW WAS
THE FUNERAL ?

35:49.710 --> 35:51.268
IT WAS OKAY.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.473
THAT POOR GIRL'S FAMILY
HAS GONE THROUGH SO MUCH.

35:53.580 --> 35:54.842
I KNOW.

35:54.950 --> 35:58.579
WELL, LIFE, IT COMES
AND GETS YOU, DOESN'T IT ?

35:58.690 --> 35:59.782
IT CERTAINLY DOES.

35:59.890 --> 36:04.429
GOODNIGHT,
BABY GIRL.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.589
ALRIGHT,

36:12.530 --> 36:14.930
FROM NOW ON, DON'T GO RUNNING

36:15.040 --> 36:17.395
FROM RICO WHAT HE NEEDS
DONE FOR THE DAY, ALRIGHT ?

36:17.500 --> 36:19.639
OH, I HOPE IT
WASN'T A PROBLEM.

36:19.740 --> 36:23.130
NO, NO, IT WASN'T,
JUST KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.502

AND CRISP APPLE STRUDELS *

36:33.320 --> 36:36.653
( urinating )

36:41.730 --> 36:43.197
ARE YOU READY
TO GET OUT OF HERE ?

36:43.300 --> 36:44.927
NOT REALLY.

36:45.030 --> 36:46.793
OKAY, THEN I'M GONNA GO.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.891
NO, KEITH,
WE CAN LEAVE.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.901
OR I CAN STAY IF IT'S JUST
GONNA BE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.729
WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE ANOTHER FEW HOURS.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.808
TH ESE GUYS TAKE THEIR
BRUNCHES VERY SERIOUSLY.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.071
THEN I'M GONNA GO.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.841
NO, I'LL GO NOW TOO.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.042
NO!

37:02.150 --> 37:03.174
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THAT WAY.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.713
REALLY, DAVID,
I'LL JUST GO.

37:04.820 --> 37:06.617
SERIOUSLY ?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.449
YEAH, I'VE GOT
THINGS TO DO.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.754
YOU KNOW,
STAY AND HAVE FUN.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.181
YOU CAN GET A RIDE
WITH PETER, RIGHT ?

37:12.290 --> 37:14.087
PATRICK.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.293
RIGHT.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.925
SURE, I GUESS.

37:21.130 --> 37:24.099
YOU'RE STILL PEEING.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.829
YEAH, I KNOW,
I HAD, LIKE, SEVEN MIMOSAS

37:27.940 --> 37:30.477
AND WAY
TOO MUCH COFFEE.

37:33.650 --> 37:36.619
SEE YOU
BACK AT HOME.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.971
OKAY.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.123
HEY, WE MISSED YOU.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.254
HOW WAS
THE FOOD SHOW ?

37:46.360 --> 37:48.123
IT WAS AMAZING !

37:48.230 --> 37:50.357
THERE WAS THIS BOOTH
WHERE YOU COULD TASTE

37:50.460 --> 37:51.358
ALL KINDS OF TRUFFLES.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.664
LIKE CHOCOLATE ?

37:52.770 --> 37:53.361
HMM ?

37:53.470 --> 37:54.596
LIKE CHOCOLATE ?

37:54.700 --> 37:56.190
NO, NO, NO,
THE MUSHROOM-THINGS.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.268
THEY WERE LIKE TWO BUCKS
FOR A PAPER-THIN SLICE.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.736
UH, THEY WERE SO GOOD,

38:00.840 --> 38:05.300
THEY TASTED LIKE CHOCOLATE
AND MUSHROOMS AND SOY SAUCE

38:05.410 --> 38:08.174
AND EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE,
IT WAS AMAZING !

38:08.280 --> 38:09.508
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.679
AND DANA WAS ESSENTIALLY
STALKED BY THIS GUY

38:11.790 --> 38:13.815
WHO WAS TRYING TO SELL HER
A SMOOTHIE FRANCHISE.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.387
HE FOLLOWED US
AROUND THE CONVENTION CENTER

38:15.490 --> 38:16.718
FOR LIKE AN HOUR,

38:16.820 --> 38:18.356
WITH HIS LITTLE TRAY
OF SMOOTHIE FLAVORS.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.793
DANA HAD TO FINALLY KINDA
HIT HIM, HOW WAS YOUR DAY ?

38:21.900 --> 38:23.993
IT WAS, OKAY.

38:24.100 --> 38:27.888
I ENDED UP JUST TAKING MAYA
WITH ME TO THE FUNERAL,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.297
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.095
YOU TOOK MAYA ?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.168
YEAH.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.034
TO SEE BRENDA ?

38:36.140 --> 38:38.608
NO, BRENDA WAS THERE,

38:38.710 --> 38:41.099
BUT I TOOK MAYA BECAUSE
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

38:41.210 --> 38:42.279
I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE--

38:42.380 --> 38:45.087
WELL, NATE,
I WOULD'VE COME HOME

38:45.190 --> 38:47.249
AND TAKEN CARE OF HER MYSELF IF
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT.

38:47.350 --> 38:50.080
WHY ?

38:50.190 --> 38:52.454
UH...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.431
DID BRENDA
HOLD MAYA ?

39:08.540 --> 39:11.873
NO, SHE WAS SLEEPING
PRACTICALLY THE WHOLE TIME.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.971
DID SHE LOOK AT HER ?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.377
WELL, YEAH.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.414
DID SHE TOUCH HER ?

39:17.520 --> 39:20.648
I GUESS, YEAH.

39:20.750 --> 39:21.751
OH GOD.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.010
SO YOU SWEAR
SHE DIDN'T HOLD HER ?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.758
YES, I SWEAR,

39:25.860 --> 39:30.126
BUT WOULD IT REALLY HAVE
MATTERED SO MUCH IF SHE DID ?

39:30.230 --> 39:32.892
DO YOU CARE
ABOUT ME AT ALL ?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.160
OF COURSE I DO !

39:34.270 --> 39:35.862
YOU AND MAYA ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY LIFE !

39:35.970 --> 39:38.666
THEN DON'T LET YOUR
OLD GIRLFRIENDS HOLD OUR BABY.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.362
I DIDN'T,
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?

39:40.470 --> 39:42.904
IT'S NOT THAT
COMPLICATED, NATE !

39:43.010 --> 39:45.069
ANYONE WHO KNOWS
THAT OTHER PEOPLE EXIST

39:45.180 --> 39:46.579
WOULD'VE ALREADY
FIGURED IT OUT !

39:46.680 --> 39:49.171
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH BRENDA ?

39:49.280 --> 39:50.417
I'M NOT, BELIEVE ME.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.589
YOU WENT TO HER
FATHER'S FUNERAL !

39:51.690 --> 39:53.282
YEAH, AFTER CHECKING
IT OUT WITH YOU !

39:53.390 --> 39:54.584
YOU SAID
IT WAS OKAY !

39:54.690 --> 39:56.055
WELL, WHY DO YOU KEEP
SPENDING TIME WITH HER ?

39:56.160 --> 39:57.354
WHY CAN'T YOU
LET HER GO ?

39:57.460 --> 39:59.257
WHATEVER BRENDA
AND I HAD, IT'S OVER.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.123
BULLSHIT !

40:01.230 --> 40:02.322
AND IT DOESN'T
TAKE ANYTHING AWAY

40:02.430 --> 40:03.852
FROM WHAT YOU
AND I HAVE NOW.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.927
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.167
KNOW WHY, NATE ?

40:06.270 --> 40:07.259
'CAUSE WHEN YOU COME BACK
FROM SPENDING TIME WITH HER,

40:07.370 --> 40:08.735
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.637
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HOW AM I DIFFERENT ?

40:10.740 --> 40:12.230
YOU'RE MORE YOU
LIKE THE YOU YOU USED TO BE.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.399
YEAH, WELL, I WISH YOU WERE MORE
FUCKING LIKE YOU USED TO BE.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.068
I HAVEN'T
CHANGED AT ALL !

40:16.180 --> 40:17.670
YES, YOU HAVE.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.804
YOU USED TO HAVE A LIFE,
YOU HAD FRIENDS, YOU HAD A JOB.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.502
YOU DIDN'T SPEND
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

40:20.610 --> 40:22.339
FOCUSING ON
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME

40:22.450 --> 40:25.487
AND HOW I'M CONSTANTLY
DISAPPOINTING YOU.

40:26.450 --> 40:27.542
I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.459
I BROUGHT
THIS FOR YOU.

40:31.190 --> 40:32.782
WELL, WHAT IS IT ?

40:32.890 --> 40:33.857
A TRUFFLE.

40:33.960 --> 40:34.858
LIS, COME ON--

40:34.960 --> 40:36.825
NATE, JUST GIVE ME
SOME GODDAMNED SPACE !

40:37.500 --> 40:39.821
OKAY.

40:40.430 --> 40:41.533
ISN'T IT WEIRD ?

40:41.640 --> 40:44.393
THAT'S THE MAN
WHO GAVE US LIFE,

40:44.510 --> 40:47.331
WHO INFLUENCED US MORE
THAN ANY OTHER MAN EVER DID

40:47.440 --> 40:48.839
OR PROBABLY
EVER WILL.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.773
AND NOW HE'S JUST
DIRT IN A JAR.

40:55.550 --> 40:58.110
I HATED HIM
FOR SO LONG.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.888
HE DID THE BEST
HE COULD.

41:01.990 --> 41:04.857
WE ALL DID.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.754
HEY, DADDY.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.122
BREN.

41:14.970 --> 41:16.460
WOW.

41:18.610 --> 41:22.034
THIS IS WHAT NATE
FACES EVERY DAY.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.802
I SUPPOSE NOW WE
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

41:27.910 --> 41:29.639
WITH YOUR FATHER'S
GODDAMNED ASHES.

41:29.750 --> 41:34.084
WELL, IT IS
KIN DA...

41:34.190 --> 41:36.010
TRADITIONAL.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.111
I CAN'T FACE THAT.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.255
NOT YET.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.520
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

41:40.630 --> 41:44.191
HE'S IN NO HURRY.

41:44.300 --> 41:48.794
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE NEVER FELT
SO MUCH LIKE MY CHILDREN BEFORE.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.903
HAVING YOUR
FATHER AROUND

41:52.010 --> 41:54.228
ALWAYS TOOK THE EDGE
OFF THAT SENSATION,

41:54.340 --> 41:55.739
I THINK.

41:55.840 --> 42:02.245
BUT I LOOK AT YOU BOTH NOW
AND YOU'RE BOTH SO MINE.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.015
THAN KS ?

42:25.870 --> 42:28.259
WHEN YOU WERE
LITTLE CHILDREN, BREN,

42:28.370 --> 42:31.806
YOU USED TO START
EVERYTHING

42:31.910 --> 42:35.539
YOU SAID TO US
WITH AN "AND" OR "BUT."

42:35.650 --> 42:36.844
YOU'D SAY,

42:36.950 --> 42:40.943
"AND MOM, CAN WE
GO TO THE STORE ?"

42:41.050 --> 42:46.989
OR "BUT DAD, WHEN WE WERE
TALKING BEFORE," YOU SAID.

42:47.090 --> 42:52.596
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS STARTED
WITH A CONJUNCTION LIKE THAT.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.828
AND THEN BILLY,
WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING,

42:55.940 --> 42:59.899
YOU DID
THE SAME THING.

43:01.570 --> 43:05.870
HE LEARNED THAT
FROM YOU, BREN.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.141
YOUR FATHER USED TO SAY
LIVING WITH YOU TWO

43:08.250 --> 43:10.571
WAS LIKE LISTENING
TO THE LONGEST SENTENCE

43:10.680 --> 43:13.786
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNIVERSE.

43:15.260 --> 43:19.253
AND NOW THERE'S NO ONE
TO HEAR IT BUT ME.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.437
DEAR CARL AND CAMERON,

43:31.540 --> 43:33.758
GREETINGS FROM
COUSIN ARTHUR.

43:33.870 --> 43:37.829
A BABY-SITTING OPPORTUNITY
PASSED ME BY TODAY,

43:37.940 --> 43:40.841
AND LEFT ME THINKING
OF YOU TWO FELLOWS.

43:40.950 --> 43:46.183
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING SPREADING
THE GOSPEL IN KANSAS CITY.

43:48.090 --> 43:51.059
MY INTERNSHIP
IS COMING ALONG SWIMMINGLY.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.822
THERE IS A DEAR,
CHARMING WOMAN HERE

43:53.930 --> 43:57.491
AT THE FUNERAL HOME
WHO IS VERY KIND,

43:57.600 --> 44:01.092
AND ATTENTIVE.

44:03.070 --> 44:06.233
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

44:13.010 --> 44:15.478
P.S., KEEPING IN TOUCH
WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

44:15.580 --> 44:17.946
IF YOU GOT
AN E-MAIL ACCOUNT.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.921
VANESSA ?

44:28.030 --> 44:28.655
YEAH ?

44:28.760 --> 44:32.628
I WAS JUST THINKING.

44:32.730 --> 44:34.197
YOU KNOW, MAYBE UH...

44:34.300 --> 44:37.758
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO SEE A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING.

44:37.870 --> 44:40.566
YOU KNOW,
GET SOME MEDICINE.

44:40.670 --> 44:42.479
FOR WHAT ?

44:42.580 --> 44:44.400
FOR, UH...

44:44.510 --> 44:47.047
I DON'T
YOUR MOOD ?

44:47.150 --> 44:52.486
MY MOOD IS EXACTLY
HOW IT OUGHTTA BE, RICO.

44:52.590 --> 44:53.818
WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIES,

44:53.920 --> 44:55.285
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BE UPSET ABOUT IT.

44:55.390 --> 44:57.813
FOR HOW LONG ?

44:57.920 --> 44:59.558
FOR HOWEVER LONG
IT TAKES.

44:59.660 --> 45:01.127
UH, LISTEN.

45:01.230 --> 45:03.653
JULIO'S PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCE IS MONDAY AT FOUR,

45:03.760 --> 45:05.159
ARE YOU GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT ?

45:05.270 --> 45:08.125
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT ?

45:08.230 --> 45:10.698
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT...

45:10.800 --> 45:12.802
THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU.

45:12.910 --> 45:14.366
ARE YOU GONNA BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT ?

45:14.470 --> 45:15.607
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T,

45:15.710 --> 45:18.941
I CAN CANCEL IT
OR CHANGE IT OR SOMETHING.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.277
YEAH, I'LL BE THERE.

45:21.380 --> 45:23.769
THANK YOU.

45:55.980 --> 45:58.619
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT BRENDA.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.814
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.253
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT BRENDA.

46:06.730 --> 46:08.584
NO?

46:08.690 --> 46:10.419
NO.

46:10.530 --> 46:12.293
YOU'VE FOUND
YOUR HAPPINESS, NATE.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.799
SHE'LL FIND HERS.

46:13.900 --> 46:15.492
IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

46:15.600 --> 46:19.866
WHAT IF I HAVEN'T
FOUND MINE ?
