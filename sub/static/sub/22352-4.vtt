[retching]

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
[gasping]

00:24.858 --> 00:26.276
[groans]

00:30.905 --> 00:32.073
[panting]

00:38.038 --> 00:40.540
[metal clattering]

00:44.377 --> 00:45.712
[Glenn] Whew.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.304
[chuckles]

00:56.139 --> 00:57.515
Word of advice, buddy.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.268
You should try to not act
so fuckin' nervous, you know?

01:00.351 --> 01:01.853
[claps]

01:01.936 --> 01:02.896
I'm not nervous.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.983
[Glenn] Really? Well, then clearly,
you're a fuckin' idiot.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.819
And the bastards in here
are gonna eat you alive.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.072
Just like my first time in college.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.575
[Glenn] Oh, is that so?
Could have fooled me.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.371
-How long you in for?
-Don't know.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.706
You don't know?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.208
-Well, that's a first.
-Oh, yeah.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.418
Fuck, let me think. About 302 days?

01:26.294 --> 01:29.214
-Thanks for the reminder.
-Don't get your panties in a twist.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.467
All I'm trying to say is,

01:32.550 --> 01:34.385
you'd do well
to make some friends in here.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.389
Otherwise,
302 days are gonna suck real hard.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.433
Yeah? I think I'm good, bro.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.813
[dumbbells clank]

01:45.980 --> 01:47.398
Think you're good, huh?

01:48.608 --> 01:51.361
You know what's funny? 'Cause you
remind me of me when I got here.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.488
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:53.571 --> 01:54.572
Let me guess.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.826
Out there in the real world,
you're king of the castle, aren't ya?

01:57.909 --> 02:01.496
Yeah. But you know what?
Once you're in here, everything changes.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.167
In here...

02:06.251 --> 02:07.752
-you ain't shit.
-[grunts]

02:08.545 --> 02:10.463
You didn't bring
your fucking castle with you.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.216
You know? No army.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.804
See, in here,  amigo...

02:20.682 --> 02:22.517
-you're alone.
-[bangs]

02:22.600 --> 02:25.186
Naked and defenseless.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.357
Yeah. So what do you do?
I'm glad you asked.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.153
You got to rebuild your castle.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.574
Brick by brick.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.076
You amass a new army.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.288
You make some fuckin' friends.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.292
I don't do free lunches.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.633
What's in it for you?

02:57.552 --> 03:00.638
A bigger fuckin' army, of course.
[laughs]

03:40.553 --> 03:41.846
[Mark] Renee...

03:42.430 --> 03:44.349
Renee, you don't need to look at that.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.393
[sobs]

03:58.696 --> 03:59.697
[gasps]

04:05.036 --> 04:06.037
[Renee sobs]

04:10.166 --> 04:12.877
I'll find who did this to you, I swear.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.758
[sobs] I'm sorry.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.148
[panting, groaning]

04:43.116 --> 04:44.117
[Judith] Okay, Renee.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.911
I'm gonna put you in your bed, okay?

04:48.788 --> 04:51.416
You're gonna have to sleep.
You need to get some sleep.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.167
[Renee] How can this be happening?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.670
I mean, maybe it's not happening.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.090
Maybe I'm just dreaming it.
I'm sleeping-- [slaps]

04:59.173 --> 05:01.884
Renee, Renee, don't do that.
Don't do that.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.637
-[sobs]
-You need to get some rest.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.889
[Judith]
You need to lie down and get some sleep.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.689
He was just here this morning,
and now he's gone.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.441
I know.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.192
It's gonna be okay.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.444
[sobbing]

05:20.236 --> 05:22.322
Okay, honey.
All right, all right, just give me this.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.283
I'll put it right up here
so you can see it, okay?

05:26.242 --> 05:27.410
There you go.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.916
I have something for you.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.877
[Renee gulps] What are those?

05:36.919 --> 05:40.840
I know it's against the rules,
but this helps me sleep,

05:40.923 --> 05:42.216
amongst other things.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.302
Just take two.

05:44.469 --> 05:48.139
-It'll help you sleep. There you go.
-Okay.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.433
-Okay, take that.
-[sniffling]

05:51.642 --> 05:52.643
Here you go.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.606
That's it.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.525
Lie down.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.863
And when you wake up...

06:05.656 --> 06:07.825
we're gonna find out
who did this to Antoine.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.371
-Okay?
-[Renee moans]

06:29.806 --> 06:31.891
[door creaks]

06:44.862 --> 06:46.864
[Dawn] I'm so sorry about Antoine.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.705
[sighs]

07:00.002 --> 07:01.754
We found this near his body.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.842
[gasps]

07:10.012 --> 07:13.599
I know you brought it
for protection, so...

07:14.725 --> 07:16.561
protect yourself.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.741
Colozopam is basically a sedative.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.869
Judith should have talked to me
about it first.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.205
-Renee's in shock.
-I know. But what if she needs to run?

07:36.789 --> 07:39.208
What if we all need to run?
Do you wanna carry a comatose body?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.252
I'll tell you this
when it's time to run, I'm runnin'.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.171
If somebody can't keep up, tough titties.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.797
Yeah, you running, that's a good one.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.508
Oh, you're real funny.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.679
Mr. Funny Guy, huh?
I bet you think cannibalism is funny too.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.764
Is that some kinda sick Millennial thing?

07:54.515 --> 07:57.393
I bet me puking up one of the nicest
people I have ever met

07:57.477 --> 07:59.353
is a laugh fucking riot to you!

08:01.022 --> 08:02.523
You know what? I bet you carved him up.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.984
Glenn, do you have proof of that?

08:05.067 --> 08:08.821
Of course he doesn't have proof.
Why would I kill Antoine?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.490
Why would you shoot at him yesterday?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.992
That was a warning shot, obviously.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.744
Where were you when Antoine was killed?

08:14.827 --> 08:17.205
Look, Keira, Keira...
come on, this is insane.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.414
It's a simple question.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.000
Glenn is just fucking with me, okay?

08:22.502 --> 08:26.506
And you know what?
This guy isn't even who he says he is.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.673
What are you talking about?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.384
Come with me.
I have something to show you.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.811
Here, check this out.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.320
It was right here.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.572
-What was?
-The pills, okay?

08:51.656 --> 08:54.325
He had a prescription
with some other guy's name on it.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.828
Benny... Benny-something or other.
I don't know.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.707
-I swear to God, they were right here.
-[Glenn] Funny guy strikes again, huh?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.043
What is this?
Some kinda practical joke? I don't get it.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.463
-Ha! Yes, right there. Told you.
-[bottle rattles]

09:12.093 --> 09:15.346
Glenn Morgan.
Glenn Morgan. Pantoprazole.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.307
Pantoprazole. It's for acid reflux.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.435
Yeah, doctor says I should give up gluten
or some shit.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.145
But, you know, I'm a slut for carbs.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.523
-Never met one I wouldn't go down on.
-[Noah] No. Okay.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.901
Look, I was looking for painkillers
in his drawer

09:28.985 --> 09:31.487
and I found a prescription
with another guy's name on it.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.615
I swear on my mother
I'm not making this up.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.243
Peter, you believe me, right?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.580
Peter, come on!

09:42.206 --> 09:43.708
Of course, of course I believe you.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.293
-Thank you, thank you.
-Well, I don't.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.422
And I think you should stay here
until we know if it's true or not.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.966
No. Wait.
Keira, Keira, Noah's my friend.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.676
He can sleep, he can read a book,

09:53.759 --> 09:55.386
-but he stays here.
-You're making a mistake.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.470
-I didn't do anything.
-It's temporary.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.389
-I didn't do anything.
-Noah!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.104
Just be a team player here, okay?

10:07.023 --> 10:11.611
Look, it's safer for all of us
if you just do what they say.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.323
Dude, this is some
industrial-grade bullshit, man.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.204
[smacks]

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
Hey, Judith.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.225
Are you all right?

10:45.770 --> 10:46.937
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.650
What's going on in that head of yours?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.112
[sighs] It's just...

10:57.573 --> 10:59.116
such a nightmare.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.128
This was supposed to be a safe space.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.475
It is a safe space.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.897
Judith...?

11:33.275 --> 11:34.693
It is.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.249
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.923
I promise.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.409
[yells] Peter!

12:28.372 --> 12:30.541
Hey! Hey!

12:32.042 --> 12:33.335
Stop! Hey!

12:33.419 --> 12:34.879
[Peter] Hey, stop!

12:38.841 --> 12:40.092
Hey!

12:40.759 --> 12:41.844
[Peter] Stop!

12:43.179 --> 12:44.013
[grunts]

12:49.310 --> 12:50.311
[yelps]

12:52.980 --> 12:54.148
[yells]

12:55.441 --> 12:58.569
[stranger]
Get off me! I said, get off me!

12:59.153 --> 13:02.656
Take your goddamn hands off me!

13:02.740 --> 13:05.117
[stranger panting, sobbing]

13:08.537 --> 13:10.623
-Who are you?
-[stranger] I told you, my name is Megan.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.249
Megan McAllister.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.335
I'm just passing through
from the national park.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.419
Yeah? It's winter.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.171
No one just passes through.
They'll freeze.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.381
-What are you doing?
-See what you can find.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.050
-Renee.
-Just do it, Keira.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.761
I know these woods
like the back of my hand.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.056
I've been doing this trek every year
for the past seven years with Gail.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.558
Wait, wait, I thought you said
you came here alone.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.688
Gail, my best friend,
she died of leukemia last summer,

13:34.772 --> 13:36.440
so I'm trekking for her this year.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.109
Why don't you guys believe me?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.361
There might be two of them.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.739
Where is she, huh?
Is she out there waiting for us?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.784
What? No. My friend died.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.744
[Megan] Jesus,
what the hell is your problem?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.955
My problem is I don't know what you're
doing on We Live As One property.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.874
-Spying on us.
-I wasn't spying on you.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.084
What the fuck is this?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.548
Please, I'll just go, okay?
I'll leave right now.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.299
Okay, Renee, you're acting crazy.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.884
Everyone just calm down.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.678
When did you get here? This morning?

14:05.761 --> 14:09.223
This morning, I woke up in my tent
on the Cedar Creek Trail, I--

14:09.306 --> 14:10.891
listened to the weather report.
It said a storm's on its way

14:10.975 --> 14:12.476
so I came here to find shelter.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.520
-I swear I'm telling the truth.
-Prove it.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.480
-Prove it how?
-Prove it.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.773
Ask the fucking reindeer!

14:17.856 --> 14:19.191
Christ! This is ridiculous!

14:19.275 --> 14:20.317
Renee, Renee, Renee.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.652
Shut up, Judith.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.614
What I find ridiculous is that somebody
did a terrible, terrible thing

14:25.698 --> 14:28.325
to my life partner, and then,
an hour later we find you.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.952
-I didn't do anything.
-[screams] Liar!

14:30.035 --> 14:32.329
-Wait, guys.
-I'm gonna ask you one last time.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.123
I was on the Cedar trail, I swear.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.875
-I swear to God. I am not lying.
-Renee, Renee, chill.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.793
-Renee, she's telling the truth.
-Just stop it!

14:37.877 --> 14:39.128
-I am not lying.
-Would you just stop it?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.087
-Liar!
-Chill!

14:40.170 --> 14:42.715
-You lying little bitch! Bitch!
-Renee!

14:43.173 --> 14:44.174
[body thumps]

14:56.020 --> 14:58.147
-I think she has a concussion.
-Yeah, no shit.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.356
It's freezing in here.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.276
Yeah, can you get some blankets?
We're gonna need to keep her warm.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.737
-No, we should tie her up.
-[Keira] Tie her up?

15:04.820 --> 15:05.905
She's not a threat.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.907
[Renee] Don't be such a fucking child.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.118
Okay. Take a look at this. Look at it.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.456
It's a park permit for the south entrance
of the park for yesterday at 8:00 a.m.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.584
That's over 50 kilometers away, Renee.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.587
That means she was nowhere near Susan,
and Gene, and Andy.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.339
[Renee] And Antoine, what about him, huh?

15:23.422 --> 15:28.093
Or this Gail person. I mean,
they could be killing us as a team.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.678
I saw her tracks in the snow.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.056
They came from the south.
She didn't try to cover 'em.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.224
I think she was telling the truth.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.684
[Peter] Found something better
than blankets.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.020
Peter, no. We can't use that inside.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.605
I'm down with that. Suffocate the bitch.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.357
Keira, she's waking up.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.109
We should tie her up.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.612
-Tie up her feet, her hands, just--
-Renee, get out.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.405
-But--
-[yells] Get out!

15:53.118 --> 15:54.995
[mutters]

15:58.958 --> 15:59.792
[Peter] Megan?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.378
[Keira] Megan, can you hear me?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.463
[Keira] We're gonna keep you lying down.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.516
[banging]

16:16.517 --> 16:18.769
[door creaking]

16:20.437 --> 16:21.605
[rattling]

16:24.400 --> 16:26.485
[Glenn] Noah...?

16:26.902 --> 16:27.987
[tapping on door]

16:30.114 --> 16:32.074
[Glenn] You rubbin' one out?
[laughs]

16:32.157 --> 16:33.701
Just go fuck yourself.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.829
You mad at me?

16:37.871 --> 16:39.039
Don't be mad.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.543
You want me to come in and say I'm sorry?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.045
[doorknob rattles]

16:46.296 --> 16:47.297
[latch clicks]

16:49.758 --> 16:50.926
[door creaks]

16:51.593 --> 16:52.928
Hey, buddy.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.764
Sorry, did I make you nervous?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.605
[inmates' voices overlapping]

17:18.370 --> 17:22.458
Well, I guess this is it, huh, brother?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.752
Guess so.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.590
Tamarind Bluffs.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.259
[RG] Yeah.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
I've watched you eyeballing this
for the last year.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.431
Gonna get your ass there, finally?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.602
Oh, that's actually gonna be
my first stop.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.272
You know, I was thinking I would just...
I would just go,

17:45.856 --> 17:48.025
I don't know,
just chill for a couple of months.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.153
Maybe head up to Bruce Peninsula.
I don't know.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.492
Yeah, it's beautiful.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.078
Looks real peaceful.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.337
Hey, you know what?

18:10.422 --> 18:11.548
Hang onto this.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.967
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.261
Give it to me next time, all right?

18:32.152 --> 18:32.986
Guess what?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.073
They found somebody spying on us.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.575
A chick.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.537
Yeah, Renee totally thought she was
a killer and went to town on her ass.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.454
[chuckles]

18:42.538 --> 18:44.790
Honestly, I didn't think
she had it in her, but wow.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.626
So they think she's the one
that's been doing this?

18:48.669 --> 18:51.338
No, no. Turns out it wasn't her.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.683
So that means
that you are still stuck here.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.186
Mayor of Shit Town, population one.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.397
[laughs]

19:09.857 --> 19:10.774
It's you.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.194
I know it is.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.405
And pretty soon
they're all gonna know that, too.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.322
Yeah?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.659
How are you gonna do that
from inside here, huh?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.872
You gonna try another bullshit story,
is that it?

19:25.414 --> 19:26.415
'Cause I hate to break it to you,

19:26.498 --> 19:29.501
you kinda blew your load
on the last one, you know?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.295
Get the fuck away from me, man.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.672
This isn't the city.
Nobody's coming to help you.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.340
This is my castle.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.634
Got that?

19:43.724 --> 19:45.893
You know, Noah, I...

19:46.852 --> 19:48.604
[panting]

19:49.313 --> 19:50.480
I like you.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.026
I really do. You're really funny.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.196
-[gasps]
-But you're weak.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.158
You're like a little yapping dog

20:01.241 --> 20:04.077
that won't shut up
and doesn't know its place.

20:05.913 --> 20:10.584
Well, you keep pushing the big dog,
and the big dog is gonna eat you alive

20:10.667 --> 20:13.462
and throw the bones over the fence
to the other side.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.550
Do you got me?

20:21.762 --> 20:22.763
Yeah.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.686
-[barks]
-[gasps] Oh, fuck.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.521
[mutters]

20:34.691 --> 20:35.859
[gasps]

20:37.027 --> 20:39.780
-Good boy.
-[sniffles]

20:47.996 --> 20:48.997
[door closes]

21:14.898 --> 21:16.191
Things got outta control.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.613
And I'm sorry for that.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.380
-We had to take some precautions.
-Those weren't precautions.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.132
That was assault. There's a difference.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.346
Renee found her husband dead
in a trunk this morning.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.682
His body was chopped up into pieces.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.812
What are you talking about?

21:54.521 --> 21:55.522
Yesterday, I...

21:59.109 --> 22:01.528
I saw my ex-girlfriend
bleeding out in the snow.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.827
Um, and...

22:08.994 --> 22:12.873
another one of our friends
froze to death with her eyes gouged out,

22:12.956 --> 22:16.918
and then let's not forget Gene,
who someone chewed up with a chainsaw.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.963
Maybe it was a goblin who grabbed us
or some bullshit like that.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.549
We don't know...

22:24.009 --> 22:25.594
we don't know who it was.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.851
Now you said that you know
these woods, right?

22:33.935 --> 22:34.770
[Megan] Yeah.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.816
Do you know any shortcuts
out to the main road?

22:40.400 --> 22:44.529
A 50-kilometer hike in the middle
of winter is dangerous enough.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.824
Trying to do it in a blizzard?

22:48.492 --> 22:50.452
[Megan] Do you really wanna take
that chance?

23:03.882 --> 23:05.383
We'd have to wait till morning.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.514
Hopefully the storm breaks before then.

23:11.181 --> 23:14.518
I've got a compass, a map...

23:15.352 --> 23:17.729
I know what trails to take
and what not to take.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.731
Wait, so you think this is doable?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.319
I think it's gonna be a fucking nightmare.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.824
But if the storm clears by sunup,

23:30.408 --> 23:32.994
that gives us the whole day
to make it halfway, at least.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.169
Thank you, Megan.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.300
[wind howling]

23:52.389 --> 23:54.558
[wincing]

24:11.908 --> 24:13.076
[sighs]

24:56.870 --> 24:57.704
Fuck.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.668
[grunts]

25:34.449 --> 25:35.617
[knife scrapes]

25:40.789 --> 25:41.957
[knocks]

25:43.375 --> 25:44.834
Howdy, stranger.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.255
[laughs] Surprise.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.430
So I said, "I have not always been
a man of the law,

25:57.973 --> 26:00.684
but I've always been a man of my word.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.647
And I vow to solemnly swear
that from this day forward,

26:05.730 --> 26:07.440
I will always respect others,

26:08.316 --> 26:10.527
be a contributing member of society,
and...

26:11.653 --> 26:13.822
to make my family proud of me."

26:16.283 --> 26:17.993
It was some real  Shawshank  shit, man.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.911
-[laughs]
-And what did they say to that?

26:21.663 --> 26:23.331
-Who? Parole board?
-Yeah.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.041
Not a lot.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.544
They just released you, anyway?

26:29.337 --> 26:30.171
Yeah.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.467
What can I tell you?
I guess it was my day.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.055
Hey, cheers.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.601
Hey, to your newfound freedom.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.066
So, where you headed?

26:52.235 --> 26:55.905
Actually, I'm joining
an intentional community.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.577
-What the fuck is that?
-It's like a commune, but not.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.662
You live in the woods.
You live together,

27:02.746 --> 27:05.623
you cook together, that kinda thing.
It's peaceful.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.168
Yeah, you know it sounds
like a fucking cult, right?

27:08.251 --> 27:10.587
Yeah. Okay, I know, I know.
I may live to regret it.

27:10.670 --> 27:11.755
But you know what?

27:12.297 --> 27:14.299
I wanna try something new, start over.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.551
I've made a lot of bad decisions
in my life

27:16.634 --> 27:18.178
and I don't wanna take
any of that shit with me.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.973
I want a fresh start.
I want a new life with purpose.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.017
With community.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.356
Anyway, we'll...

27:30.273 --> 27:32.150
we'll find out soon. Headed out tomorrow.

27:32.233 --> 27:35.904
Hey, I'm happy to drop you off anywhere
along the route, man.

27:35.987 --> 27:36.988
Within reason.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.992
You know, actually, this hippie
commune shit sounds pretty good.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.161
Yeah, I think I'll go with you.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.414
I mean, what's going alone
without a friend, right, brother?

27:51.252 --> 27:52.670
Good to see you, man.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.849
[panting]

-[groans]

28:35.922 --> 28:36.881
Oh, fuck!

28:40.009 --> 28:41.010
[gasping]

28:42.429 --> 28:43.430
Fuck!

28:47.851 --> 28:49.060

29:13.918 --> 29:15.420
-[faint creaking]
-[gasps]

29:20.091 --> 29:21.176
Shit.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.761
Oh, God.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.179
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Are you okay?

29:24.262 --> 29:25.472
I'm fine. Ahem.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.849
I'm okay.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.060
-You know, I'll just leave you be.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.563
Why don't you stay?
I actually need... help cooking.

29:34.814 --> 29:39.360
-What's on the menu?
-Well, a bean mushroom soup thingy.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.947
It's whatever I could find
in your cupboards.

29:43.239 --> 29:48.119
I was considering using these mushrooms,
but they look all kinds of suspect, so...

29:48.203 --> 29:50.246
Well, Antoine's a--

29:53.416 --> 29:55.919
Antoine's a freegan... was a freegan.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.923
It's "free food vegan" is "freegan,"
I guess.

30:03.176 --> 30:06.054
A lot of what we eat
is from these woods right around here.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.851
Hey, let's party.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.728
-Hmm?
-[sighs]

30:26.449 --> 30:28.368
[Noah] Guys, help!

30:29.160 --> 30:30.161
[grunts]

30:32.914 --> 30:33.957
Guys!

30:34.040 --> 30:36.251
Help! It's...

30:36.334 --> 30:37.961
it's Glenn! Help!

30:38.044 --> 30:39.921
It's Glenn! Guys!

30:46.177 --> 30:49.138
You know, I gotta say, Dawn, this is
a lot better than your camp cooking.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.724
-[Dawn chuckling]
-[Peter] Impressed.

30:51.808 --> 30:52.725
What is it?

30:53.268 --> 30:56.604
I believe the chef referred to it
as her "white bean Tuscan stew."

30:56.688 --> 30:57.689
Mm.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.693
[footsteps approaching]

31:11.077 --> 31:12.996
[Dawn] Hey, Renee,
why don't you come sit here?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.540
Thanks.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.555
It's fine. Just eat, guys. Eat.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.516
Here you go.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.647
[Renee] Megan...

31:43.693 --> 31:46.362
I'm sure you've heard
what's been going on around here.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.491
I don't know what to say.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.291
Doesn't matter.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.003
Let's just eat.

32:10.970 --> 32:11.804
Where's Noah?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.974
Um, Noah's...

32:15.058 --> 32:16.935
[Mark] He just said he was feeling shitty.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.604
And Glenn too.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.984
I'll go check on them,
see if they have an appetite yet.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.335
Hey, Glenn, dinner's ready if you want it.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.016
Noah?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.394
[knocks]
Comin' in.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.772
[key rattles]

33:06.359 --> 33:07.819
[wind whistling]

33:24.961 --> 33:26.170
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.424
-I'm gonna find Noah.
-[Dawn] What? Why?

33:29.507 --> 33:31.384
He's not in his room and his window is--

33:32.635 --> 33:35.596
look, Noah and Glenn aren't in their rooms
and Glenn's window is wide open.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.265
-I'm going to find him.
-[Dawn] Wait, are you insane?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.142
Don't worry about it.
Just give me the gun.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.935
No, no, no, no. What are you even
gonna do outside? It's freezing.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.104
-Dawn, just give me your fuckin' gun.
-Please. Please don't go.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.981
Wait, wait, wait, we fucked up
and now Noah's in deep shit.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.274
Give me--

33:47.650 --> 33:48.818
give me the gun.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.532
What if it's Noah?

33:55.533 --> 33:56.826
-What?
-Maybe it's Noah.

33:56.909 --> 33:57.994
Maybe Noah went after Glenn.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.579
[Peter] That's bullshit.

33:59.662 --> 34:00.872
Noah's not capable
of doing anything like that.

34:00.955 --> 34:02.206
Yes, he is.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.709
He is, and you know it.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.720
Hey, hey, hey! Keira!

34:15.803 --> 34:16.804
Stop!

34:17.472 --> 34:19.640
You wanna find Noah? I know where to go.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.831
[Glenn grunts, sighs]

34:53.549 --> 34:56.469
Hey, how many "intentionally
community" people

34:56.552 --> 34:58.721
-you think are up there, anyway?
-[faint trickling]

34:58.805 --> 35:00.389
Maybe ten? I don't know.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.228
-Think they like to get fucked up?
-I don't know.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.939
Maybe they put acid in the Kool-Aid,

35:08.022 --> 35:10.316
have orgies every other Monday.
That'd be fucking great.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.944
Like I said, I don't know.

35:17.031 --> 35:20.743
Hey, you remember that time we got hash
from Marv on Thanksgiving?

35:21.661 --> 35:23.746
Laced with molly. You got all fucked up.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.376
I thought for sure
you were gonna lose your shit, man.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.676
-What's going on?
-I can't do this.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.387
-Can't do what?
-This.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.763
Start over again with you yapping

35:40.847 --> 35:43.432
about every fucking thing
that happened in jail, man.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.644
-Look, I'm over it. It's done, okay?
-Yeah.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.229
Okay, man.
We'll talk about the fucking weather.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.355
Jesus.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.273
Look...

35:52.150 --> 35:53.651
I fucked up.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.530
I dealt drugs, and I hurt people,
and I paid for that, okay?

35:57.613 --> 36:00.658
I'm clean now, and I want a fresh start.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.827
Okay? I want a new life.

36:02.910 --> 36:06.539
And I don't want anything
that reminds me of that fucking time,

36:07.456 --> 36:11.169
of that waste of my fucking life.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.591
-Waste, huh?
-[mutters]

36:16.674 --> 36:18.843
Oh, come on.
it wasn't all that fucking bad, man.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.637
-What about--?
-What about...? What about what?

36:24.473 --> 36:27.268
I don't know how you got out.
I don't wanna know, and I don't care.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.063
I promise you, I will not rat you out.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.483
But I'm gonna drop you off
at the next gas station.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.529
Look, I have some money you can have.
You just go, okay?

36:39.155 --> 36:41.407
You go and you start over clean,
like I'm doing.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.410
Okay, listen. Listen, man.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.996
You're fucking tired, man.
You're exhausted.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.581
You've been driving all night, that's all.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.458
Why don't you just get some rest,
all right?

36:50.917 --> 36:53.920
Get some rest, I'll take the wheel.
We'll talk about this tomorrow, okay?

37:07.767 --> 37:09.268
That day I got out...

37:13.898 --> 37:17.902
it was the best day of my life.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.905
Because I knew...

37:23.324 --> 37:28.412
that I would never have to see
your fuckin' face again.

37:28.996 --> 37:33.668
That I would never
have to touch you again.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.336
-There was never a you and me.
-Don't say that.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.213
I scratched your back, you scratched mine.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.590
-That arrangement is over!
-No, don't say that.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.676
-Get the fuck away from me!
-Don't fucking say that!

37:41.926 --> 37:43.594
[bangs]

37:43.678 --> 37:45.012
[yells]

37:49.558 --> 37:51.018
-[grunts]
-[crashes]

37:54.313 --> 37:55.648
[panting]

38:21.299 --> 38:23.175
[wind howling]

38:34.603 --> 38:35.771
[panting]

38:35.855 --> 38:38.024
-[moaning]
-[door closes]

38:45.698 --> 38:49.577
You remember when I said
not to fuck with me? Hmm?

38:49.660 --> 38:50.995
[grunts]

38:51.287 --> 38:53.164
You really shoulda listened.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.211
Tell me, what am I gonna do
with you now, Noah?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.629
Hmm?

39:03.966 --> 39:05.384
You looked through my shit.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.928
You snitched me out to the others.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.722
[Noah groans]

39:09.805 --> 39:11.599
[Glenn]
And we both know what you saw now.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.312
Which means you will definitely snitch
on me again, won't you?

39:16.395 --> 39:18.230
[whimpering]

39:19.899 --> 39:21.067
[Noah sobs]

39:24.737 --> 39:26.197
[grunting]

39:27.531 --> 39:29.200
[Glenn] You see, the problem is...

39:32.411 --> 39:34.622
you haven't left me with any choice.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.210
[Glenn] I mean...

39:40.836 --> 39:42.630
I can't let you go now.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.842
-Can I?
-[Noah moans]

39:47.927 --> 39:49.095
No.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.431
No, I can't.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.692
Why don't you get some rest, Megan?

40:04.860 --> 40:06.695
You can take one of the beds upstairs.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.532
I think I'm just gonna lay here.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.994
Hey, why don't you come with me upstairs
and we'll get you to bed?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.082
Come on.

40:28.342 --> 40:32.388
Wait. Look, the sky.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.724
There are so many stars.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.854
That's what I love about being up north.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.774
The air is so clean and clear.

40:44.358 --> 40:46.235
Megan, honey, what are you talking about?

40:46.777 --> 40:48.112
There's Cassiopeia.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.490
Cassiopeia.

40:52.074 --> 40:55.494
Okay. Megan, I think...
we gotta get you to bed, okay?

40:56.579 --> 40:57.580
Hey.

40:59.081 --> 41:01.333
-[screams] No!
-Megan, what are--?

41:01.917 --> 41:03.836
-No!
-Megan.

41:03.919 --> 41:06.005
-Stay the fuck away!
-Calm down.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.007
-Calm down. Megan!
-Stay the fuck away!

41:08.090 --> 41:11.427
[screaming]
You're dead! You're not real!

41:11.510 --> 41:12.678
Please, Megan.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.056
-[retching]
-Megan...? [gasps]

41:18.309 --> 41:20.019
No. Stop.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.480
-[splatters, coughs]
-[Dawn] Oh, God.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.694
[screaming]
You can't take me!

41:28.777 --> 41:31.489
Megan. Megan, look at me.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.699
-[screams] No!
-Megan, look at me.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.160
Look at me! Look at me, look at me.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.412
Hey. Hey.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.540
Hey, you're fine.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.667
[Dawn] You're fine.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.463
See? See, you're okay.

41:48.547 --> 41:49.381
You're okay.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.926
You're fine. It's gonna be--

41:52.009 --> 41:52.843
[screams] No!

41:52.927 --> 41:53.802
-Megan!
-[bangs]

41:56.847 --> 41:58.349
Oh, my God.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.020
[gasps]

42:04.313 --> 42:05.981
[panting]

42:08.359 --> 42:10.110
[Glenn grunting]

42:14.240 --> 42:17.159
You could hurt yourself, brother.
Stop it.

42:21.121 --> 42:22.456
Okay, I'll tell you what...

42:23.916 --> 42:27.044
I will consider taking the tape off,

42:28.003 --> 42:29.755
but you've gotta promise me

42:29.838 --> 42:32.508
that you're gonna chill the fuck out,
all right?

42:34.301 --> 42:36.637
-Deal?
-[whimpers]

42:37.638 --> 42:39.932
Attaboy. Okay.

42:43.602 --> 42:46.397
Remember, you promise not to squeal
like a little bitch, right?

42:49.066 --> 42:50.859
[yelling]
No, no! Help! Fuck, help!

42:50.943 --> 42:51.944
Help me, please!

42:52.027 --> 42:53.862
-Help me!
-That's fucking working!

42:53.946 --> 42:55.781
[Glenn yelling]

42:55.864 --> 42:58.033
-"Help me! He's a psycho!"
-[Noah] Help me, please!

42:58.117 --> 43:01.662
[Glenn screaming, laughing]

43:02.121 --> 43:03.581
Help...!

43:04.748 --> 43:06.500
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.129
Nobody can fucking hear you, man.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.465
And nobody's gonna find you out here.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.635
You're mine.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.640
[Keira] This is it.

43:22.516 --> 43:23.684
Come on.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.271
[Keira] Why is the door open?

43:57.718 --> 44:00.679
-[Mark sighs]
-No one's safe, are they, Renee?

44:07.645 --> 44:09.313
What are you trying to say?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.900
You said you wanted to strangle her.

44:15.361 --> 44:18.238
-She was our only way out.
-[Judith] You're right.

44:18.322 --> 44:21.492
And if you didn't want us to get out...

44:22.076 --> 44:23.661
I'm not the one who made
the goddamn dinner, okay?

44:23.744 --> 44:25.746
If anyone poisoned her, it was her.

44:25.829 --> 44:28.248
Don't you think we'd all be dead?
We all ate the same thing.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.501
Maybe you gave Megan a little extra.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.462
Okay, Mark, you were with me
in the kitchen the entire time, right?

44:33.545 --> 44:34.380
So...

44:35.881 --> 44:37.549
No, not the entire time.

44:39.551 --> 44:42.721
When you were ladling out the stew,
I was in here gathering the troops.

44:44.765 --> 44:47.351
So you think I'm the one
who poisoned her bowl?

44:48.227 --> 44:49.687
It's unreal.

45:02.408 --> 45:04.284
"Leaves of three, let it be."

45:05.536 --> 45:06.995
"Berries white, run in fright."

45:07.663 --> 45:10.165
That's a rhyme we were all taught
to keep from getting poisoned.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.043
-I did not put those in there.
-[Wren] Bullshit.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.462
It's one of the first things you would've
learned here as a camp counselor.

45:17.297 --> 45:19.341
I didn't put them in there.
That was not me.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.804
[Keira panting]

45:23.887 --> 45:25.055
What is that?

45:28.100 --> 45:29.393
[Keira] Oh, God.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.443
-[grunts]
-[Peter gasps]

45:44.867 --> 45:46.034
It's Glenn, right?

45:48.078 --> 45:50.998
Yes, ma'am. The one and only.
[chuckles]

45:51.707 --> 45:53.375
I'm Renee. We spoke on the phone.

45:53.459 --> 45:54.668
Oh, right.

45:54.751 --> 45:58.213
Please let me say that it is a pleasure
to meet you in the flesh, finally.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.131
Yeah.

45:59.214 --> 46:00.924
Do you need some help with your stuff?

46:01.550 --> 46:03.927
No, ma'am. This is all I brought.

46:09.391 --> 46:10.893
Allow me to explain.

46:15.022 --> 46:18.108
I'm traveling light because I'm... well...

46:19.776 --> 46:22.696
the man I was in the past,
I ain't bringing him here.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.034
[Glenn] I need a fresh start.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.746
I need community.

46:31.830 --> 46:35.584
I know you're looking at me like,
"This guy ain't no granola eater,"

46:35.667 --> 46:39.463
but I really think if you--
if you take a chance to get to know me...

46:40.589 --> 46:43.217
you'll find out we've got a lot more
in common than you thought.

46:47.513 --> 46:48.514
You know, I...

46:49.306 --> 46:51.517
I'm sorry. The last thing I want
is to make anybody uncomfortable.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.769
So I... thank you, anyways.

46:54.353 --> 46:55.646
No, wait. Wait.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.110
You're right, Glenn.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.196
"We Live As One" is not just our name.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.658
It's an intent to embrace diversity

47:07.741 --> 47:11.578
so that we can be a unity to one another.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.582
And everyone is welcome.

47:17.292 --> 47:20.045
Everyone adds a unique voice
to this community.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.129
And so...

47:22.839 --> 47:24.841
I would love it
if you added yours to ours.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.637
-Welcome, my brother.
-[sniffles]

47:29.513 --> 47:31.390
You guys hug, huh?
[laughs]

47:35.394 --> 47:37.020
[Mark murmurs]

47:46.321 --> 47:48.156
[faint grunting]

47:54.830 --> 47:56.999
[panting]

47:57.791 --> 48:00.836
Shh. It's okay. Just rest.

48:01.587 --> 48:02.588
Just rest.

48:03.630 --> 48:05.549
You're okay. You're okay.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.635
I got this really great idea.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.516
Since you love to scream so much...

48:18.145 --> 48:20.314
I was thinking
we should play a little game.

48:26.486 --> 48:28.530
Play a little game where we see

48:28.614 --> 48:32.492
just how loud you can scream for me.

48:35.245 --> 48:36.246
[sighs]

48:38.665 --> 48:39.750
-[rips]
-[gasps]

48:45.422 --> 48:47.382
[Glenn chuckles]

48:47.466 --> 48:48.634
I see.

48:49.635 --> 48:50.927
I see.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.015
-[Noah grunts]
-Don't worry.

48:55.515 --> 48:58.977
It's gonna be so much fun.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.896
[grunts]

49:01.980 --> 49:03.440
[Glenn] Won't that be fun? Huh?

49:03.523 --> 49:05.942
-Won't that be fun?
-[groans]

49:06.026 --> 49:07.402
-[thumps]
-[grunts]

49:14.284 --> 49:17.037
-Huh, you son of a bitch?
-No, it's not-- [grunts]

49:20.290 --> 49:22.542
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-[Noah screams] Help me!

49:23.126 --> 49:25.420
-Please! No, no, no.
-You gonna make me work?

49:25.504 --> 49:28.757
You're gonna make me work
to get a scream now, is that it? Huh?

49:28.840 --> 49:31.718
I'll work for it, you fuckin' faggot!

49:31.802 --> 49:33.095
Fuckin' right.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.263
-Give me a scream, you little bastard!
-No!

49:35.347 --> 49:37.432
No! No!

49:37.516 --> 49:39.142
-Scream!
-No!

49:39.226 --> 49:40.727
-Scream!
-No!

49:40.811 --> 49:42.270
Scream!
