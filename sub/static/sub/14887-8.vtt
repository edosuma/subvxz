Cousin, now that we are

14:55.270 --> 14:57.806
lean cuisine,
fighting machines.

15:01.810 --> 15:02.778
[grunting]

15:11.652 --> 15:13.822
I hope we don't have
to use karate on anyone

15:13.855 --> 15:16.557
because as the sensei said

15:16.591 --> 15:19.660
the most powerful weapon
is the voice of love.

15:19.694 --> 15:21.396
Right.
Tell me about it.

15:21.429 --> 15:22.964
It's not like
I'm looking for trouble.

15:25.366 --> 15:26.802
Hey, you!

15:26.835 --> 15:28.436
Get away from my car!

15:29.805 --> 15:31.239
Now, get out of here!

15:34.709 --> 15:36.744
Cousin, I..

15:36.778 --> 15:38.947
...think that lady
was just waiting for the bus.

15:44.629 --> 15:47.365
[instrumental music]

15:50.936 --> 15:52.370
You know, Balki,
I was surprised

15:52.403 --> 15:53.671
to hear you wanted
to came back here

15:53.705 --> 15:56.241
after that guy Chuck
wiped up the bar with you.

15:58.476 --> 15:59.878
I didn't want
to come back here.

15:59.911 --> 16:01.612
Cousin Larry told me
that you and Jennifer

16:01.646 --> 16:03.314
wanted to come back.

16:03.348 --> 16:05.283
Oh, I'm not wild
about this place.

16:05.316 --> 16:07.152
The lighting makes
my skin look sallow.

16:09.855 --> 16:11.890
Balki, Larry told us
you wanted to come here.

16:18.363 --> 16:21.166
I can see clearly now
the lane is gone.

16:22.868 --> 16:24.569
Nobody wants to be here.

16:24.602 --> 16:25.937
How come we're here?

16:25.971 --> 16:27.939
I wanted to come here, okay?

16:27.973 --> 16:29.474
So relax.

16:29.507 --> 16:31.276
I'm picking up
the Chuck, check.

16:31.309 --> 16:32.343
I'm picking up the check.

16:38.283 --> 16:40.786
Cousin, your motives
are less than pure.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.255
You came here to
pick a fight with Chuck.

16:44.289 --> 16:45.256
Now, we're leaving.

16:45.290 --> 16:47.258
No, wait a minute.
Sit down.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.628
Now, we've been avoiding
this place for weeks.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.231
I came here as a matter
of principle.

16:53.264 --> 16:54.700
We should have
the freedom to eat

16:54.733 --> 16:56.434
where we want
without having to

16:56.467 --> 16:58.336
worry about
bar slime like Chuck.

16:59.971 --> 17:01.439
Larry, you better
lower your voice

17:01.472 --> 17:03.274
because the bar slime
just slid in.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.849
Oh, well you look at that.
I'm outta water.

17:11.883 --> 17:13.550
I better go to the bar
and get a refill.

17:13.584 --> 17:15.286
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.555
Have you forgotten
what our sensei told us?

17:17.588 --> 17:19.457
"A victory born of revenge

17:19.490 --> 17:22.292
will satisfy only
the shallowest of souls."

17:22.327 --> 17:23.428
I've got no problem
with that.

17:27.065 --> 17:28.934
It's not like
I'm looking for trouble.

17:28.967 --> 17:29.935
Cousin, cousin.

17:32.070 --> 17:32.670
If you're not
looking for trouble

17:32.704 --> 17:34.305
then sit down at the table.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.408
Balki, I'm out of water

17:37.442 --> 17:38.509
and I'm darn thirsty.

17:40.511 --> 17:42.580
Come on, do you..
Look, I promise

17:42.613 --> 17:44.682
I'll go out of my way
to avoid a fight.

17:44.716 --> 17:45.683
Is that what you wanna hear?

17:45.717 --> 17:46.885
Yes, it is.

17:46.918 --> 17:47.886
Fine.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.689
I'll be right back.

17:55.927 --> 17:56.995
Watch it, buddy.

18:01.632 --> 18:02.968
Sorry.

18:03.001 --> 18:04.936
I just bet you are.

18:08.439 --> 18:09.274
You don't remember me,
do you?

18:10.508 --> 18:12.744
Should I?

18:12.778 --> 18:15.747
A few weeks ago you hit on
the woman I was in here with.

18:15.781 --> 18:17.983
When I said something about it
you dragged me down this bar

18:18.016 --> 18:20.451
then you beat up my cousin.

18:20.485 --> 18:21.486
Now do you remember me?

18:22.921 --> 18:24.489
You're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

18:27.592 --> 18:29.360
You beat me up.

18:29.394 --> 18:30.495
That may not have
meant anything to you

18:30.528 --> 18:34.632
but it meant something
to me and I demand an apology.

18:34.665 --> 18:38.069
Look, I don't
apologize to nobody.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.405
Jerk, I think you and I

18:40.438 --> 18:42.407
had better step outside.

18:43.742 --> 18:45.610
[chuckles]

18:45.643 --> 18:48.513
Why don't you get outta here
before you get hurt?

18:49.480 --> 18:50.515
What's the matter?

18:50.548 --> 18:52.517
You chicken, Chuck?

18:54.619 --> 18:57.422
Hey, everybody.
Chuck here is chicken.

18:58.523 --> 18:59.090
[clucks]

19:03.929 --> 19:05.797
Nobody calls me chicken.

19:05.831 --> 19:09.367
Oh, is that right,
my fine feathered friend?

19:15.106 --> 19:17.408
Now, Chuck, Chuck.

19:17.442 --> 19:20.445
You know, where I‐where
I come from that's a compliment.

19:22.748 --> 19:25.550
The chicken is a symbol
of bravery and honor.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.386
And as a matter of fact
the chicken happens to be

19:28.419 --> 19:31.022
the Myposian
national bird.

19:31.056 --> 19:34.025
And that's the kind of thing
that I felt would be of interest

19:34.059 --> 19:36.862
to a man of your integrity
and obvious physical strength.

19:40.098 --> 19:43.601
I must warn you,
I know karate.

19:43.634 --> 19:45.403
I must warn you,
I don't care.

19:46.171 --> 19:49.107
[grunting]

19:57.749 --> 20:00.685
Wait. Wait.

20:00.719 --> 20:03.088
Everything is under control.
Go back to your libations.

20:03.121 --> 20:04.655
Show's over.

20:04.690 --> 20:06.491
‐ Cousin. Cousin. Cousin.
‐ Balki, Balki.

20:06.524 --> 20:07.993
Please, do you mind?
I'm having a moment.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.161
[grunts]

20:10.195 --> 20:11.930
What are you doing?

20:11.963 --> 20:13.564
'Stop it, guys.
Don't do it.'

20:15.901 --> 20:17.803
[grunting]

20:17.836 --> 20:18.804
‐ Balki.
‐ 'Leave Cousin Larry alone.'

20:21.873 --> 20:24.609
[instrumental music]

20:32.117 --> 20:34.052
Larry, are you sure
you're alright?

20:34.085 --> 20:36.521
I'm fine, fine.

20:36.554 --> 20:39.090
In karate we learn
how to take a fall.

20:39.124 --> 20:40.792
And you do it very well.

20:43.061 --> 20:45.797
Well, I'm just glad
everyone's alright.

20:45.831 --> 20:47.032
Come on, Mary Anne.

20:47.065 --> 20:48.199
‐ Bye, Balki.
‐ Bye‐bye.

20:58.143 --> 21:01.079
Cousin, don't feel bad.

21:01.112 --> 21:02.914
You almost had him.

21:02.948 --> 21:05.751
I had you ahead on points until
he cut off your air supply.

21:09.287 --> 21:12.023
Balki, it's not just
that I got beaten up.

21:12.057 --> 21:12.824
Again.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.095
And it's not
that I was humiliated.

21:17.128 --> 21:18.096
Again.

21:19.064 --> 21:20.265
In front of Jennifer.

21:20.298 --> 21:21.266
‐ Again.
‐ Are you helping?

21:21.299 --> 21:22.467
Is‐Is this
some kind of help?

21:26.537 --> 21:28.606
Don't you see
what's happened?

21:28.639 --> 21:31.576
I've gone from peaceful
little Larry Appleton

21:31.609 --> 21:34.612
to a guy who
picks fights in bars.

21:35.981 --> 21:37.749
At least when I was
getting beaten up

21:37.783 --> 21:39.484
I was a nice person.

21:42.988 --> 21:44.022
I was a nice person,
wasn't I?

21:47.058 --> 21:49.861
Oh, I'm just kidding. Of course,
you are a nice person.

21:49.895 --> 21:51.963
You still a nice person.
That's why you are upset.

21:51.997 --> 21:53.899
Now, sit down, listen.

21:53.932 --> 21:55.701
You learned a very
important lesson tonight.

21:55.734 --> 21:57.769
Oh, you're darn right I did.

21:57.803 --> 21:59.771
I learned I never should've
taken karate to begin with.

21:59.805 --> 22:02.874
No, no, no.

22:02.908 --> 22:04.042
‐ No?
‐ What did I just say?

22:04.075 --> 22:04.976
‐ No.
‐ That's right.

22:06.878 --> 22:09.781
Now, cousin there's nothing
wrong with taking karate.

22:09.815 --> 22:12.718
It's fun.
It's good exercise.

22:12.751 --> 22:15.286
We get to wear snazzy outfits
and go barefoot.

22:16.722 --> 22:19.290
But...you're doing
what you always do.

22:19.324 --> 22:21.326
You take a good thing

22:21.359 --> 22:23.561
and you pound it
into the ground.

22:24.595 --> 22:26.698
Now, why can't
you just take karate

22:26.732 --> 22:30.201
and learn self‐defense
and be a nice person?

22:33.038 --> 22:34.572
I do enjoy the classes.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.742
And our sensei said
you were a karate natural.

22:38.209 --> 22:39.277
He said I was a natural?

22:40.311 --> 22:41.579
In two languages.

22:44.950 --> 22:46.684
He probably said that
because I move so well.

22:48.053 --> 22:50.989
[grunting]

22:53.792 --> 22:55.894
You know,
I‐I think he said it

22:55.927 --> 22:58.263
because your legs
are so short.

22:59.965 --> 23:02.600
‐ Just kind of‐‐
‐ Come on. Get up.

23:02.633 --> 23:03.935
‐ Come on, try again.
‐ Oh, no, cousin.

23:03.969 --> 23:05.270
‐ Try and hit me.
‐ Cousin, cousin.

23:05.303 --> 23:06.905
Come on, give it
your best shot.

23:06.938 --> 23:09.040
Cousin, we've had
enough hitting for one‐‐

23:09.074 --> 23:10.341
Come on, come on,
I won't hurt you.

23:11.109 --> 23:13.845
[grunting]

23:17.983 --> 23:18.950
Uh!

23:24.690 --> 23:28.226
Cousin, a‐are you‐are
you...alright?

23:28.259 --> 23:29.260
[inhales heavily]

23:30.896 --> 23:31.997
Fine.

23:32.030 --> 23:33.331
I'm fine.

23:33.364 --> 23:34.332
Balki.

23:35.867 --> 23:36.935
I'm going to pass out now.

23:39.170 --> 23:41.907
[instrumental music]

23:44.675 --> 23:47.612
[theme music]

24:05.030 --> 24:07.833
[music continues]
