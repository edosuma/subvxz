(heart beating faintly)

01:05.358 --> 01:07.625
Oh, thank God, you're here.

01:07.627 --> 01:08.860
Are you okay?

01:08.862 --> 01:11.662
I'm good.

01:11.664 --> 01:14.332
All of the antibiotics that
they're using aren't working.

01:14.334 --> 01:16.334
Hi, Max.

01:16.336 --> 01:18.870
(monitor beeping steadily,
air pumping)

01:18.872 --> 01:21.005
They think the pneumonia's
turning to staph.

01:21.007 --> 01:24.876
They've asked me if
I want to sign a DNR.

01:27.313 --> 01:28.846
(crying):
Please tell me

01:28.848 --> 01:30.748
that we're not there yet.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.917
I won't give up.

01:32.919 --> 01:35.319
I promise.

01:35.321 --> 01:37.121
(crying)

01:40.260 --> 01:42.560
(heart beating)

01:43.863 --> 01:47.432
Why don't you go get
a coffee or a sandwich?

01:47.434 --> 01:49.734
I'll figure it out.

04:26.359 --> 04:28.426
(doorbell rings)

04:29.929 --> 04:31.729
Ramona Royale-- is she in?

04:31.731 --> 04:33.164
Sir, it is 4:00 in the morning.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.765
I hear she's
a night person.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.834
Move!

04:42.909 --> 04:45.810
Ramona!

04:47.046 --> 04:48.512
Ramona Royale!

04:48.514 --> 04:50.781
What the hell?!

04:50.783 --> 04:52.250
Shall I call
the police, madam?

04:52.252 --> 04:53.517
Oh, sure, call the cops, Jeeves.

04:53.519 --> 04:54.952
I could use a snack.

04:54.954 --> 04:56.287
It's fine, Graves.

04:56.289 --> 04:57.888
I've got this.

04:57.890 --> 05:01.259
What the hell
are you doing back here?

05:01.261 --> 05:04.562
I told you already
I don't have any use for you.

05:04.564 --> 05:05.930
You were wrong about that.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.699
Who's this?

05:08.701 --> 05:09.900
(chuckles)

05:09.902 --> 05:13.037
The answer to
your prayers.

05:13.039 --> 05:15.973
You said you wanted an
inside man-- she's it.

05:15.975 --> 05:19.243
She manages
The Cortez.

05:19.245 --> 05:21.445
Hell's wrong with her?

05:21.447 --> 05:23.881
She's kind of a drunk.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.816
She'll sober up.

05:25.818 --> 05:27.451
Drunk, huh?

05:27.453 --> 05:29.620
You want to take down
The Countess?

05:29.622 --> 05:30.988
So do I.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.890
And Iris here is the key.

05:32.892 --> 05:36.594
Nobody gets closer
to The Countess than she does.

05:36.596 --> 05:38.462
You did.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.231
We both did.

05:42.435 --> 05:44.902
IRIS: You're
a movie star.

05:46.406 --> 05:48.739
Was.

05:52.979 --> 05:54.445
You're so beautiful.

05:54.447 --> 05:56.080
Yeah.

05:56.082 --> 05:57.848
Real waste, isn't it?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.183
It is a waste.

05:59.185 --> 06:01.752
Goddamn shame.

06:01.754 --> 06:03.487
She took that life
away from you.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.023
Promised you
something better,

06:06.025 --> 06:08.326
then took that away
from you, too.

06:08.328 --> 06:11.762
I know just
how that feels.

06:11.764 --> 06:14.865
You want to
make her bleed.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.835
I want that, too, 'cause
she did the same thing to me.

06:17.837 --> 06:20.771
Only, in my case,
she never even gave me a choice.

06:20.773 --> 06:24.709
Did you give
her a choice?

06:24.711 --> 06:27.044
What do you mean?

06:27.046 --> 06:28.879
Your mama.

06:28.881 --> 06:32.450
And I know that ain't
no case of the DTs.

06:32.452 --> 06:33.851
She been turned.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.787
You do that?

06:36.789 --> 06:38.456
DONOVAN: I did
what I had to do.

06:38.458 --> 06:41.892
I don't know if that's
oedipal or just mercenary.

06:41.894 --> 06:43.527
Either way...

06:43.529 --> 06:45.029
you're intrigued.

06:45.031 --> 06:48.733
You're reckless.

06:48.735 --> 06:50.401
I like that.

06:50.403 --> 06:52.069
IRIS:
We're all gonna die.

06:55.742 --> 06:56.907
She'll know.

06:56.909 --> 07:00.077
The moment she sees me,
she'll know.

07:00.079 --> 07:02.246
She never
looks at you.

07:04.817 --> 07:07.718
You're invisible.

07:07.720 --> 07:11.756
Which makes her
the perfect inside man.

07:11.758 --> 07:13.624
Right.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.909
NURSE: You know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.

07:31.911 --> 07:34.078
Doctor.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.580
Can you believe it?

07:36.582 --> 07:37.948
They thought he wouldn't
make it through the night,

07:37.950 --> 07:39.383
and here he is
begging me for snacks.

07:39.385 --> 07:42.019
Jalapeño cheddar, my fav!

07:42.021 --> 07:43.220
It's incredible.

07:43.222 --> 07:44.722
(chuckles softly)

07:44.724 --> 07:47.425
But can I see his chart?

07:49.562 --> 07:51.195
X-rays are clear.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.230
NURSE: Never seen
anything like it.

07:53.232 --> 07:55.433
He was in full
respiratory failure.

07:55.435 --> 07:57.201
It's a miracle.

07:58.871 --> 08:00.971
Yes.

08:00.973 --> 08:02.873
Yes, it is.
Does that mean

08:02.875 --> 08:03.874
we can take him home?

08:03.876 --> 08:05.443
I don't see why not.

08:05.445 --> 08:08.279
(chuckles)

08:08.281 --> 08:10.281
Doctor, I don't know
what you did,

08:10.283 --> 08:12.616
but I know you saved
my son's life.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.051
Thank you.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.822
Let's get the paperwork
ready for his discharge.

08:28.734 --> 08:30.801
(panting)

08:45.751 --> 08:48.853
Where the hell
have you been?

08:48.855 --> 08:52.022
You look like shit.

08:53.793 --> 08:55.860
What's wrong?

08:55.862 --> 08:57.495
What's wrong is
you asking me what's wrong.

08:57.497 --> 08:58.829
I just want to go to bed--
is that a problem?

08:58.831 --> 09:00.865
No, honey.

09:00.867 --> 09:03.367
Not a problem.

09:03.369 --> 09:06.670
It looks like mama

09:06.672 --> 09:08.606
needs a little
hair of the dog

09:08.608 --> 09:10.875
to help her
sleep it off.

09:14.947 --> 09:16.947
IRIS:
What is it?

09:16.949 --> 09:20.784
Liz's special
somethin' somethin'.

09:20.786 --> 09:22.853
Just drink, honey.

09:25.391 --> 09:26.957
Go ahead.

09:34.066 --> 09:37.167
Ah, that's good.

09:37.169 --> 09:39.169
Well...
It's good.

09:39.171 --> 09:40.971
it should be.

09:40.973 --> 09:42.873
It's from The Countess's

09:42.875 --> 09:44.909
secret stash.

09:44.911 --> 09:47.344
I'm drinking blood?

09:47.346 --> 09:50.648
With a drop
of triple sec.

09:52.518 --> 09:53.884
You know how this goes, honey.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.553
This little cocktail's
gonna hold you

09:55.555 --> 09:57.922
for the next couple hours,
but you're going to need

09:57.924 --> 10:00.891
to feed on fresh blood.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.493
Warm, living blood.

10:02.495 --> 10:04.762
Oh, God.
And soon.

10:04.764 --> 10:06.597
For 20 years,

10:06.599 --> 10:09.767
I looked into the eyes
of those children,

10:09.769 --> 10:14.338
and seen the pain and
the fear in their eyes.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.740
God, how am I gonna...?

10:16.742 --> 10:19.944
Oh, I can't even
say the words.

10:23.449 --> 10:25.516
Can I have some more?

10:27.687 --> 10:29.420
Sure.

10:36.796 --> 10:39.463
(laughs)
Look at you.

10:39.465 --> 10:42.967
In your moment of

10:42.969 --> 10:44.969
transplendent rebirth.

10:44.971 --> 10:47.771
How exciting to me!

10:47.773 --> 10:49.206
"How exciting"?

10:49.208 --> 10:51.775
Give me a goddamn break.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.945
This world holds nothing
for women like me.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.747
When you get to be my age,
men look right through you.

10:56.749 --> 10:57.948
(chuckles)

10:57.950 --> 10:59.583
Unless they
want something.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.786
It's not just them,
it's everyone.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.923
You're invisible,
unless you can give them a key.

11:05.925 --> 11:07.558
An extra goddamn pillow.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.260
Ask any one of those
guests upstairs

11:10.262 --> 11:12.129
who checked them in. Oh...

11:12.131 --> 11:16.066
I guarantee you, they wouldn't
remember a single detail.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.073
It's ironic.

11:23.075 --> 11:24.608
Isn't it?

11:24.610 --> 11:28.846
I'm damned to eternity
in this body.

11:28.848 --> 11:31.682
With this life.

11:31.684 --> 11:35.853
This... dark,
meaningless little soul.

11:35.855 --> 11:38.322
Right when it's
never been worse.

11:41.961 --> 11:44.728
Hmm.

11:47.366 --> 11:50.267
Yeah, I guess it's just me

11:50.269 --> 11:54.271
and the one-armed bandit
down at Morongo's,

11:54.273 --> 11:57.608
every Saturday night
till the end of time.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.209
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky, honey.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.282
You might try a little
violet eye shadow.

12:05.284 --> 12:08.318
It works for me every time.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.387
¶ ¶

12:13.492 --> 12:15.559
(bus approaching outside)

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
(brakes squeak)

12:22.702 --> 12:24.768
(horn honks)

13:05.377 --> 13:06.744
Where were you?

13:06.746 --> 13:08.278
You didn't
answer my texts.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.747
I almost died.

13:09.749 --> 13:11.381
No way.
WOMAN: Max.

13:11.383 --> 13:14.384
I thought the letter that
we sent home was very clear.

13:14.386 --> 13:15.886
No weapons allowed in school.

13:15.888 --> 13:17.621
It's plastic.
It's a sword,

13:17.623 --> 13:19.356
no matter what it's made of.
Come on.

13:22.762 --> 13:25.195
Thank you.

13:25.197 --> 13:26.964
Come help with decorations.

13:26.966 --> 13:28.766
Stupid rules.

13:28.768 --> 13:31.735
Pritchard took
my witch's wand.

13:31.737 --> 13:34.304
I've got a backup.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.975
I missed you.

13:45.551 --> 13:47.551
So tell the truth.

13:47.553 --> 13:49.553
You weren't
really gonna die.

13:49.555 --> 13:50.788
I was in the hospital.

13:50.790 --> 13:51.989
Measles.

13:51.991 --> 13:53.557
I had red spots

13:53.559 --> 13:55.392
all over.

13:55.394 --> 13:56.927
Ew.

13:56.929 --> 13:59.062
Are you contagious?

14:00.099 --> 14:02.966
I'm so much better now.

14:09.175 --> 14:10.808
Ow!

14:10.810 --> 14:12.709
Did you just bite me?

14:14.847 --> 14:16.580
There.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.917
We're even.

14:19.919 --> 14:22.853
Now you can
taste my blood.

14:25.925 --> 14:27.691
Okay, guys,
I know it's Halloween,

14:27.693 --> 14:29.359
and we're all excited
about the party,

14:29.361 --> 14:31.795
but that does not mean
there won't be class work today.

14:31.797 --> 14:35.566
So open your books to chapter
three, "Synonyms and Antonyms."

14:37.203 --> 14:39.169
Where are Max and Madeline?

14:39.171 --> 14:41.071
(students murmuring, giggling)

14:44.810 --> 14:46.043
PRITCHARD:
What happened?

14:46.045 --> 14:48.245
(crying):
I'm itchy all over.

14:49.782 --> 14:51.682
Oh, you are burning up.

14:53.786 --> 14:55.919
(screams)

14:57.456 --> 14:58.956
(groans)

14:58.958 --> 15:00.490
What are you doing?!
Drink it.

15:00.492 --> 15:02.659
Drink it, Maddie.

15:02.661 --> 15:04.561
You're gonna
be stronger

15:04.563 --> 15:06.730
and feel better
than you've ever felt.

15:16.876 --> 15:18.876
Jimmy?

15:18.878 --> 15:20.510
I don't feel good.

15:20.512 --> 15:21.745
Let's get you
to the nurse.

15:21.747 --> 15:23.380
Where's Mrs. Pritchard?

15:27.987 --> 15:29.686
(students groaning, coughing)

15:29.688 --> 15:31.755
What?

15:34.093 --> 15:35.826
Mrs. Pritchard!

15:39.765 --> 15:41.765
It's not my fault.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.767
(panting)

15:45.704 --> 15:47.004
Oh, my...

15:48.440 --> 15:50.774
(grunting)

15:56.916 --> 15:59.516
Drink. It'll make you
feel awesome.

16:07.126 --> 16:08.025
(groaning)

16:15.801 --> 16:18.835
(screaming)
No!

16:20.773 --> 16:22.706
(screaming)

16:41.593 --> 16:44.828
You know, Patty, your costume is
really culturally insensitive.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.130
You have that dot
on your forehead.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.632
I'm Hindu.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.634
I love Halloween.

16:50.636 --> 16:53.637
I like the candy,
I like the costumes,

16:53.639 --> 16:55.973
and I love being scared.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.240
(screams)

16:57.242 --> 16:58.575
Shit.

17:01.847 --> 17:04.147
(gagging)

17:04.149 --> 17:05.916
I'm gonna move your
hand now, okay?

17:05.918 --> 17:08.285
Jill, come help me now!
He's been attacked!

17:08.287 --> 17:09.920
Patty, put the
school in lockdown!

17:11.690 --> 17:13.991
Lockdown, lockdown.

17:13.993 --> 17:16.460
This is not a drill.
Lockdown, lockdown.

17:16.462 --> 17:18.528
(alarm blaring)

17:22.434 --> 17:24.701
(sirens wailing)

17:24.703 --> 17:26.169
(helicopter flying overhead)

17:32.878 --> 17:34.011
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

17:55.868 --> 17:57.334
I want that perimeter secure.

17:57.336 --> 17:59.403
No one goes in or out.

17:59.405 --> 18:01.905
(crowd murmuring)

18:18.924 --> 18:20.190
Don't be afraid.

18:20.192 --> 18:22.492
You're safe now.

18:38.844 --> 18:40.911
¶ ¶

18:55.360 --> 18:57.427
MAN:
Madeline!

18:59.364 --> 19:01.932
Daddy! Daddy.

19:01.934 --> 19:04.234
Sir, I'm sorry, we have
an ongoing situation.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.802
I need to ask your daughter
some questions.

19:05.804 --> 19:07.537
Okay.

19:07.539 --> 19:09.773
Madeline, I know you've
been through a lot,

19:09.775 --> 19:11.308
but you're safe.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.277
No one's gonna hurt
you anymore, okay?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.279
Can you tell me what happened
inside the school?

19:16.281 --> 19:18.815
How many people
attacked you?

19:18.817 --> 19:21.084
Th-There was just one man.

19:21.086 --> 19:23.086
Dressed in black.

19:23.088 --> 19:26.089
He had a mask over his face.

19:26.091 --> 19:28.158
And he cut Mrs.
Pritchard with a knife.

19:31.597 --> 19:35.499
Um, and he was a big guy, and he
had a mask on his face, and...

19:35.501 --> 19:36.900
Son.

19:36.902 --> 19:38.168
How are you feeling?

19:38.170 --> 19:41.671
Are you up to answering
some questions?

19:41.673 --> 19:42.973
Yes, sir.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.308
I know exactly what happened.

19:58.357 --> 20:00.090
You want to explain to me
what happened last night?

20:00.092 --> 20:02.792
Uh, they-they must have
drugged me.

20:02.794 --> 20:04.261
Yeah.

20:04.263 --> 20:06.029
Let's talk about the suspects.

20:06.031 --> 20:07.030
John Wayne Gacy,

20:07.032 --> 20:08.598
Jeffrey Dahmer,

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
Richard Ramirez,
Aileen Wuornos?

20:10.602 --> 20:12.302
Not saying it was them.

20:12.304 --> 20:13.670
Of course it wasn't.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.272
That's who they
claimed to be.

20:15.274 --> 20:16.806
It's Halloween, Detective.
Did it ever occur to you

20:16.808 --> 20:18.041
that maybe
they might...

20:18.043 --> 20:19.309
Yeah, of course
it occurred to me!

20:19.311 --> 20:22.479
That's not what this is.

20:22.481 --> 20:24.948
Okay, so what is it?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.320
It's, uh...

20:30.322 --> 20:32.455
(mumbles)

20:32.457 --> 20:34.624
Must be some kind of...

20:34.626 --> 20:36.826
copycat blood cult.

20:36.828 --> 20:38.795
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> you call it what you want to.</i>

20:38.797 --> 20:42.465
It was people who are recreating
or are continuing

20:42.467 --> 20:45.869
the crimes committed by
notorious killers from the past.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.004
(man screams)
March-- there was a guy.

20:48.006 --> 20:50.807
One guy called himself March,
James Patrick March.

20:50.809 --> 20:52.842
You just check out the
history of the hotel.

20:52.844 --> 20:54.644
That's the name of
the guy who built it.

20:54.646 --> 20:56.713
And you had dinner with him.

20:58.483 --> 21:01.851
I was in a room with a guy
who claimed to be him,

21:01.853 --> 21:03.853
a guy who I think is responsible

21:03.855 --> 21:06.756
for the five dead bodies
on the wall in my office!

21:06.758 --> 21:09.359
You think he's
The Ten Commandment Killer?

21:09.361 --> 21:10.961
I do.

21:12.364 --> 21:13.897
I do.

21:13.899 --> 21:17.167
Lieutenant, we need
to get a-a warrant,

21:17.169 --> 21:18.668
cadaver dogs, forensics team.

21:18.670 --> 21:19.936
We need to rip
those walls apart,

21:19.938 --> 21:21.504
down to the studs
if you have to,

21:21.506 --> 21:23.173
'cause the answers are in there!

21:23.175 --> 21:25.342
I'd stake my reputation on it.

21:25.344 --> 21:26.910
You're gonna have to ante up
more than that

21:26.912 --> 21:28.245
because your reputation's shit.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.879
(sighs)

21:29.881 --> 21:32.782
Let's be honest,
it has been for a while.

21:32.784 --> 21:34.584
What's that supposed to mean?

21:34.586 --> 21:36.386
It means I probably should
never have signed off

21:36.388 --> 21:38.188
on that marginal psych
evaluation you received

21:38.190 --> 21:40.790
five years ago
after your breakdown.

21:44.563 --> 21:47.364
That was different.

21:47.366 --> 21:49.366
Our son had been taken.

21:49.368 --> 21:51.901
I was under a lot of stress.

21:51.903 --> 21:53.470
This job is stress, John.

21:53.472 --> 21:55.905
(sighs)

21:55.907 --> 21:57.974
I'm sorry.

21:57.976 --> 22:00.143
I'm gonna have to do what's
right for the department.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.780
You're firing me.

22:03.782 --> 22:06.516
Your pension will be safe.

22:17.262 --> 22:20.597
Nothing is safe.

22:20.599 --> 22:21.898
Nothing.

22:25.337 --> 22:27.337
¶ ¶

22:42.587 --> 22:44.587
(bell dings)

22:44.589 --> 22:46.656
(clears throat)

22:51.863 --> 22:53.863
How can I help you?

22:53.865 --> 22:55.865
We're wondering if
you had any special rates

22:55.867 --> 22:58.268
for, like, influencers.

23:01.306 --> 23:03.306
I beg your pardon?

23:03.308 --> 23:08.111
Uh, well, um, I used to shoot
for<i> Entrez-Vous Magazine,</i>

23:08.113 --> 23:11.481
and I heard that
Will Drake took over,

23:11.483 --> 23:14.084
and he's liked a shit-ton
of my Instagram pics.

23:16.021 --> 23:19.022
We would like a room.

23:19.024 --> 23:19.556
And a discount.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.895
(chuckles) Look, I'm sure
you can't get the full rate

23:25.897 --> 23:27.897
at this hour on
Hallo-friggin'-ween.

23:27.899 --> 23:30.200
Oh, we are so over
trick-or-treaters.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.502
Our-our neighborhood
used to be kind of rad.

23:32.504 --> 23:34.204
But now it's just Strollerville.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.071
Everyone started

23:35.073 --> 23:36.706
pooping out kids.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.342
So many brats.

23:39.344 --> 23:42.245
The doorbell
would not...

23:42.247 --> 23:45.315
stop... ringing.

23:46.685 --> 23:48.918
We just want to hide
out and smoke out

23:48.920 --> 23:51.121
and not deal
with a zillion randos.

23:53.658 --> 23:55.658
I hope this suits you.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.726
Wait.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.728
Hey, w-wait.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.530
No, we-we want to stay
in one of the rooms

24:00.532 --> 24:02.198
that Will Drake
has redone.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.601
Well, they're all
more or less untouched.

24:04.603 --> 24:07.170
This is a hard no. I'm out.

24:07.172 --> 24:09.773
No, babe, can we try
and make this work?

24:09.775 --> 24:13.710
Justin, you keep dropping us
in these situations.

24:13.712 --> 24:15.779
Can we get, like,
way better sheets?

24:15.781 --> 24:17.747
I mean, poly-blend?

24:17.749 --> 24:19.949
I'll see what I can find.

24:24.423 --> 24:25.889
(groans)

24:25.891 --> 24:27.290
Are these the
only towels?

24:27.292 --> 24:29.959
They're made of, like,

24:29.961 --> 24:31.394
sandpaper or something.

24:31.396 --> 24:33.196
I'll send up some extras.

24:34.966 --> 24:37.967
Can you just, like,

24:37.969 --> 24:40.570
review all that
we just asked you for?

24:40.572 --> 24:42.439
Like, out loud?

24:42.441 --> 24:45.141
We just want to make sure
that you heard us right.

24:45.143 --> 24:47.210
(sighs)

24:50.715 --> 24:54.217
They're treating me
like an imbecile.

24:56.922 --> 24:58.922
(elevator bell dings)

24:58.924 --> 25:01.057
¶ ¶

25:22.981 --> 25:24.948
Oh.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.450
Hey.

25:27.452 --> 25:29.085
Out for the evening?

25:29.087 --> 25:30.787
Mr. Drake doesn't
appear to be in.

25:30.789 --> 25:32.789
If you happen
to see Will,

25:32.791 --> 25:35.859
remind him he's invited
to Demi's this evening.

25:35.861 --> 25:38.661
Will do.

25:38.663 --> 25:41.030
(sniffing)

25:45.837 --> 25:48.505
Is there...?

25:48.507 --> 25:50.907
Can I do anything?

26:03.788 --> 26:05.989
You seem nervous.

26:05.991 --> 26:08.291
You smell different.

26:08.293 --> 26:09.893
And you're sweating.

26:11.129 --> 26:13.029
Oh.

26:14.966 --> 26:16.799
It must be Halloween.

26:16.801 --> 26:19.135
It's all the people
in the costumes.

26:19.137 --> 26:21.337
It's just...

26:21.339 --> 26:23.640
Keeps me on edge.

26:25.977 --> 26:28.044
Must be.

26:37.989 --> 26:40.056
(phone ringing)

26:42.761 --> 26:44.193
Front desk.

26:44.195 --> 26:46.329
Yeah, uh, I want to order
some room service.

26:46.331 --> 26:48.932
I'm in the mood for a plate
of artisanal cheeses

26:48.934 --> 26:51.000
and a full-body red.

26:51.002 --> 26:53.870
Oh, and get an order
of grilled romaine-- super yum.

26:53.872 --> 26:55.939
Uh, and an order
of grilled romaine.

26:55.941 --> 26:57.273
Uh, I'm sorry.

26:57.275 --> 26:59.876
Make sure it's organic
and non-GMO.

26:59.878 --> 27:02.412
I-I don't think we have
anything like that...

27:02.414 --> 27:04.247
Well, just tell the chef
to grill the lettuce,

27:04.249 --> 27:06.349
throw in a little parm,
lemon juice, cracked pepper.

27:06.351 --> 27:08.351
(stammers)
I can't do that.

27:08.353 --> 27:10.420
Our-our cook barely
speaks English...

27:10.422 --> 27:13.356
Uh, what I'm hearing is that
you're not even willing to try.

27:13.358 --> 27:16.960
So, um, I'm gonna make things
really simple for you.

27:16.962 --> 27:19.362
There is a restaurant
renaissance happening

27:19.364 --> 27:21.598
downtown right now,
so all you got to do

27:21.600 --> 27:23.700
is pick up the
phone, order out,

27:23.702 --> 27:26.302
and bring in some pâté
for Christ's sakes.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.213
Hey.

27:37.215 --> 27:38.815
What did they want?

27:38.817 --> 27:41.184
Pâ...

27:43.254 --> 27:45.822
Pâté.

27:49.427 --> 27:51.828
Bitches want pâté?

27:51.830 --> 27:53.429
Pâté they shall have.

27:53.431 --> 27:55.164
Oh, oh, man.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.000
I don't understand
how cat food

27:57.002 --> 27:58.801
can smell worse
than cat poop.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.770
(laughs)

28:00.772 --> 28:03.573
Those fancy kids are gonna know
that we're messing with them.

28:03.575 --> 28:05.308
They eat their
salad cooked.

28:05.310 --> 28:08.845
I mean, they're, like,
gourmets or something.

28:08.847 --> 28:10.480
They need to believe
they're the kind of cool

28:10.482 --> 28:13.783
that eats pâté in a shit hotel
on Halloween night.

28:13.785 --> 28:16.119
They will swallow whatever
we put in front of them.

28:16.121 --> 28:17.286
(pops lips)

28:17.288 --> 28:19.355
You don't miss a thing,
do you?

28:21.760 --> 28:24.894
You see everything when
the world doesn't see you.

28:26.865 --> 28:29.866
Guilty as charged.

28:29.868 --> 28:32.935
We worked together
over 20 years,

28:32.937 --> 28:35.304
and we haven't had this
much conversation combined

28:35.306 --> 28:37.340
in all that time.

28:37.342 --> 28:40.810
Well, you had your son.

28:40.812 --> 28:43.680
Yeah, well, you're
being generous with me.

28:43.682 --> 28:45.848
I'm not homophobic.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.483
I'm not gay.

28:47.485 --> 28:48.685
And you see?

28:48.687 --> 28:50.987
That's why I stayed away.

28:50.989 --> 28:56.359
'Cause I-I look at you,
and all I see is questions.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.828
Well, you can't offend me.
Ask away.

28:58.830 --> 29:00.730
Uh-huh.

29:00.732 --> 29:04.200
So, how does something
like this happen?

29:04.202 --> 29:06.369
How does a married man
from Topeka

29:06.371 --> 29:10.273
wind up as Liz Taylor
in the Hotel Cortez?

29:12.577 --> 29:14.744
<i> Her name was Tracy.</i>

29:14.746 --> 29:16.746
<i> She married me</i>
<i> because she was 30</i>

29:16.748 --> 29:18.147
<i> and needed to marry someone.</i>

29:18.149 --> 29:19.182
(door closes)

29:19.184 --> 29:20.817
What are you watching?

29:20.819 --> 29:23.519
You have the weirdest taste
in TV shows.

29:23.521 --> 29:24.754
Isn't Cosby on tonight?

29:24.756 --> 29:26.756
Thursdays.

29:26.758 --> 29:30.393
<i> I married her because</i>
<i> we were the same dress size.</i>

29:30.395 --> 29:32.929
<i> When I was home,</i>
<i> I was like a man</i>

29:32.931 --> 29:35.531
<i> walking between the raindrops.</i>

29:35.533 --> 29:37.900
<i> No release</i>
<i> from the constant burning.</i>

29:40.271 --> 29:41.871
It's for your trip.

29:41.873 --> 29:44.407
This is a 707.

29:46.277 --> 29:50.113
I fly a 757 to Los Angeles.

29:50.115 --> 29:52.782
It has only two engines.

29:52.784 --> 29:55.585
TRACY:
Don't you have to pack?

29:58.923 --> 30:00.757
<i> But I had the road.</i>

30:00.759 --> 30:04.227
<i> I was a medical rep</i>
<i> for Eli Lilly.</i>

30:04.229 --> 30:05.928
<i> It was a golden age for us.</i>

30:05.930 --> 30:08.531
<i> We used to schmooze doctors.</i>

30:08.533 --> 30:10.633
<i> Took them golfing,</i>
<i> took them out for steaks,</i>

30:10.635 --> 30:12.201
<i> to strip clubs.</i>

30:12.203 --> 30:15.204
<i> Plenty of alcohol</i>
<i> to numb myself.</i>

30:15.206 --> 30:17.206
<i> But the real release came</i>

30:17.208 --> 30:20.109
<i> when I was finally alone</i>
<i> in my room.</i>

30:20.111 --> 30:22.411
We're taking Schwartz and Siegel
to the Palm at 8:30

30:22.413 --> 30:23.980
and then to Crazy Girls.

30:23.982 --> 30:25.782
This time,
we're all wearing rubbers

30:25.784 --> 30:27.617
so we don't stain our slacks.
(laughter)

30:27.619 --> 30:29.552
Nothing like an L.A. lap dance.

30:29.554 --> 30:30.887
Yeah.
You in, Nicky?

30:30.889 --> 30:32.722
Oh, no, thanks.

30:32.724 --> 30:34.624
I'm all about
room service

30:34.626 --> 30:37.293
and a good night's
sleep tonight.

30:37.295 --> 30:38.995
Don't watch too much porn.
Yeah!

30:38.997 --> 30:39.996
(both laugh)

30:39.998 --> 30:41.964
¶ As we fall in love ¶

30:41.966 --> 30:45.868
¶ And I just can't seem
to get enough... ¶

30:56.815 --> 30:59.448
<i> For those first few moments</i>

30:59.450 --> 31:02.652
<i> in those rooms...</i>

31:02.654 --> 31:03.853
<i> (laughs)</i>

31:03.855 --> 31:09.258
<i> ...I was transformed!</i>

31:09.260 --> 31:12.595
¶ And when it rains,
you're shining down for me... ¶

31:12.597 --> 31:14.831
Hey. Uh, yes, hello.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.633
Can I get a-a glass
of champagne, please?

31:17.635 --> 31:20.203
<i> You know what?</i>
<i> Bring the whole bottle.</i>

31:20.205 --> 31:21.204
<i> (chuckles)</i>

31:21.206 --> 31:23.039
Thank you.

31:23.041 --> 31:26.042
<i> And there's nothing like</i>
<i> whispering a secret aloud,</i>

31:26.044 --> 31:28.845
<i> if only to yourself.</i>

31:28.847 --> 31:32.615
<i> The slip, that fur,</i>
<i> those tiny rooms--</i>

31:32.617 --> 31:34.517
<i> they were my furlough.</i>

31:34.519 --> 31:37.720
<i> Freedom.</i>

31:37.722 --> 31:40.122
(knocking)
MAN: Room service.

31:40.124 --> 31:42.491
Yeah. Thank you.

31:42.493 --> 31:44.894
Can you leave
it outside?

31:44.896 --> 31:47.230
I just got out
of the shower.

31:47.232 --> 31:49.232
I'll bring you
the tip later.

32:03.715 --> 32:06.182
(tray crashes)

32:06.184 --> 32:07.884
(chuckles)

32:07.886 --> 32:09.785
What are you doing here?

32:11.823 --> 32:14.724
Get out. Get out of my room!

32:14.726 --> 32:16.726
This isn't what it looks like!

32:16.728 --> 32:18.060
(shushes)

32:20.832 --> 32:23.065
I've been watching
you, love.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.801
I saw you come into the lobby.

32:27.705 --> 32:32.675
You dress like a man,
walk like a man...

32:32.677 --> 32:34.744
but you smell like a woman.

32:37.448 --> 32:40.383
It's Paco Robanne.

32:40.385 --> 32:43.252
Not your skin.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.958
Your blood.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.594
(crying)

32:56.200 --> 32:58.267
(sobbing):
Oh, my God.

33:02.907 --> 33:04.273
You're so...

33:06.210 --> 33:09.745
You're so beautiful.

33:09.747 --> 33:13.015
Why do you cry, love?

33:14.986 --> 33:17.286
I'm so ugly.

33:21.559 --> 33:23.826
No.

33:23.828 --> 33:25.861
You don't lack beauty.

33:28.566 --> 33:31.567
You lack commitment.

33:31.569 --> 33:33.035
Let me help you.

33:36.841 --> 33:39.642
Become who you were born to be.

33:41.612 --> 33:43.913
A goddess.

33:50.254 --> 33:51.787
(whispers)

33:51.789 --> 33:54.023
¶ ¶

33:54.025 --> 33:56.058
LIZ:
<i> I was her living doll.</i>

33:57.996 --> 33:59.862
¶ Her hair was Harlow gold... ¶

33:59.864 --> 34:02.098
You need a smoky eye.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.467
Like Donna Mills
in<i> Knots Landing.</i>

34:04.469 --> 34:05.668
Hmm.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.938
¶ Her hands are never cold ¶

34:10.975 --> 34:13.509
¶ She's got
Bette Davis eyes... ¶

34:13.511 --> 34:15.277
What is your name?

34:15.279 --> 34:17.713
Well...

34:17.715 --> 34:19.048
Nick Pryor.

34:19.050 --> 34:20.883
No.

34:20.885 --> 34:24.887
With that white slip
and shame-wrapping fur,

34:24.889 --> 34:27.990
I christen you Liz Taylor

34:27.992 --> 34:29.992
à la<i> Butterfield 8.</i>

34:29.994 --> 34:32.294
¶ And she'll tease you ¶

34:32.296 --> 34:34.296
¶ She'll unease you ¶

34:34.298 --> 34:37.733
¶ All the better
just to please you... ¶

34:37.735 --> 34:38.868
Let's go to The Roxy.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.536
You can borrow
one of my Halstons.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.004
I'll call up Mick Jagger.
I...

34:42.006 --> 34:43.839
¶ She knows just
what it takes... ¶

34:43.841 --> 34:45.508
I can't go out like this.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.910
Oh, honey.

34:47.912 --> 34:49.979
Goddesses don't
speak in whispers.

34:49.981 --> 34:51.213
They scream.

34:51.215 --> 34:52.915
No, no. I'm sorry.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.885
Okay.

34:55.887 --> 34:58.320
So we're not ready to scream.

34:58.322 --> 35:01.891
How about a tiny yelp
just to warm up the pipes?

35:07.565 --> 35:09.932
Go down the hallway...

35:09.934 --> 35:11.167
Oh, God.

35:11.169 --> 35:13.369
...and fetch us some ice.

35:13.371 --> 35:15.337
¶ And she'll tease you... ¶

35:15.339 --> 35:17.740
<i> I never felt so naked</i>
<i> in all of my life.</i>

35:17.742 --> 35:19.842
¶ She'll unease you... ¶

35:19.844 --> 35:21.377
<i> The shame of nudity.</i>

35:21.379 --> 35:23.079
¶ Just to please you ¶

35:23.081 --> 35:25.114
¶ She's precocious... ¶

35:25.116 --> 35:26.949
<i> But also the freedom.</i>

35:26.951 --> 35:31.220
¶ Just what it takes
to make a pro blush ¶

35:31.222 --> 35:35.124
¶ She got Greta Garbo
standoff sighs ¶

35:35.126 --> 35:38.227
¶ She's got
Bette Davis eyes... ¶

35:38.229 --> 35:40.262
<i> I was Venus in the clamshell.</i>

35:43.534 --> 35:45.101
<i> I was a goddess</i>
<i> born upon the world.</i>

35:45.103 --> 35:48.104
¶ She'll let you take her home ¶

35:48.106 --> 35:50.473
¶ It whets her appetite... ¶

35:55.446 --> 35:57.313
What in the holy hell?

35:57.315 --> 35:58.948
What is this, Nicky?

35:58.950 --> 36:00.216
Are you a fag?

36:00.218 --> 36:01.984
Holy shit!

36:01.986 --> 36:04.353
I took a sip of his Sprite
on the plane.

36:06.824 --> 36:07.823
What if he has AIDS?

36:07.825 --> 36:08.891
(sighs)

36:08.893 --> 36:10.826
How could you
let me do that?

36:10.828 --> 36:12.962
I'm... I'm not gay.

36:12.964 --> 36:14.463
You are so toast

36:14.465 --> 36:15.931
at the office, man.

36:15.933 --> 36:16.999
And if you think Janet

36:17.001 --> 36:18.234
isn't going
to tell Tracy...

36:18.236 --> 36:19.668
Do you have AIDS?

36:19.670 --> 36:21.437
I need to know.

36:21.439 --> 36:23.272
Tell me,
you goddamn faggot!

36:23.274 --> 36:26.742
I'm not gay!

36:26.744 --> 36:29.912
Look at me,
you piece-of-shit bastards!

36:29.914 --> 36:33.516
See me and go to hell!

36:33.518 --> 36:36.018
Howdy, boys.

36:42.026 --> 36:44.093
We have two selves:

36:44.095 --> 36:47.763
the one the world
needs us to be--

36:47.765 --> 36:49.431
compliant--

36:49.433 --> 36:52.268
and the shadow.

36:53.838 --> 36:57.373
Ignore it, and life is
forever suffering.

37:00.811 --> 37:02.945
Mmm.

37:05.983 --> 37:08.717
IRIS:
She didn't...?

37:08.719 --> 37:10.953
Infect me?

37:10.955 --> 37:12.288
No.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.857
She hired me instead.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.992
I never went
back to Topeka.

37:16.994 --> 37:18.727
I kept the fur.

37:18.729 --> 37:21.497
I send the money though.

37:21.499 --> 37:23.966
I did...

37:23.968 --> 37:26.035
till the kids turned 18.

37:27.905 --> 37:29.505
We don't speak.

37:29.507 --> 37:31.574
You're so brave.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.343
You are!

37:34.345 --> 37:35.678
Oh, come on.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.745
Don't you get it?

37:36.747 --> 37:38.080
Stop ignoring yourself.

37:38.082 --> 37:41.050
Especially now.

37:41.052 --> 37:44.887
It's time to stop
taking shit.

37:44.889 --> 37:48.891
Scorch the damn
earth before you.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.561
How about you start

37:52.563 --> 37:55.664
by teaching that hipster
couple some manners?

38:10.781 --> 38:13.382
REPORTER: Authorities are still
piecing together the details...
IRIS: Room service.

38:13.384 --> 38:15.584
Entrée.

38:15.586 --> 38:17.686
REPORTER: Eyewitness accounts
describe the assailant...

38:17.688 --> 38:19.888
JUSTIN:
Just put it anywhere.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.390
...heavy build,
dressed in black.

38:21.392 --> 38:23.626
Whoa.

38:23.628 --> 38:25.761
Are you okay?
You seriously look terrible.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.630
I-I'm not trying
to be a dick.

38:27.632 --> 38:29.398
I just don't know
if you're ill or something.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.699
It's common courtesy to tell us

38:30.701 --> 38:31.767
if you're
handling our food.

38:31.769 --> 38:33.669
I'm not sick.

38:40.144 --> 38:41.644
Where's the romaine?

38:41.646 --> 38:42.911
WOMAN:
You're kidding.

38:42.913 --> 38:45.147
I tried to tell you
on the phone...

38:45.149 --> 38:46.949
So no green vegetables?

38:46.951 --> 38:48.684
JUSTIN: I don't think
she's the vegetable type.

38:50.988 --> 38:53.756
At least the pâté
is somewhat decent.

38:53.758 --> 38:55.624
(woman giggles)

38:55.626 --> 38:56.959
We're a little
high on edibles.

38:56.961 --> 38:57.993
He's not usually
this awful.

38:57.995 --> 38:59.328
JUSTIN:
Awful?

38:59.330 --> 39:01.096
You know who's being awful?

39:01.098 --> 39:02.898
(door slams)
Will Drake
is being awful,

39:02.900 --> 39:04.900
with this puke brown carpet

39:04.902 --> 39:06.502
and that cracked tile
in the bathroom.

39:06.504 --> 39:07.836
I get it, you can't

39:07.838 --> 39:09.505
refurbish every room
at the same time,

39:09.507 --> 39:11.473
but how about trying to start
with hiring

39:11.475 --> 39:12.641
some hot waitstaff?

39:12.643 --> 39:14.310
We should've gone
to the Ace.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.912
That place is teeming
with hot young Dominicans

39:16.914 --> 39:19.515
and Harajuku
fabulousness.

39:20.851 --> 39:23.152
Oh, my God.

39:23.154 --> 39:25.854
You almost sliced
off my toe.

39:25.856 --> 39:27.089
Are you Alzheimer's?

39:27.091 --> 39:29.458
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It was just...

39:29.460 --> 39:30.626
It was an accident,
that's all.

39:30.628 --> 39:32.127
Uh, I think it was deliberate.

39:32.129 --> 39:33.462
You know,
you've been hostile

39:33.464 --> 39:34.930
ever since we checked in.

39:34.932 --> 39:37.199
JUSTIN:
100%.

39:37.201 --> 39:38.834
That's reckless
endangerment.

39:38.836 --> 39:40.469
We can make sure that
you never work again.

39:40.471 --> 39:43.105
It's really a matter
of public safety.

39:43.107 --> 39:44.273
You are clearly

39:44.275 --> 39:46.008
a danger to society.

39:47.945 --> 39:50.012
Oh, my God. Somebody help!

39:50.014 --> 39:52.114
Oh, my God. Help!

39:52.116 --> 39:54.883
You think the world didn't exist

39:54.885 --> 39:57.519
before you were born?!

39:57.521 --> 40:00.522
You've suffered nothing!

40:00.524 --> 40:02.458
You have no idea

40:02.460 --> 40:06.328
what it's like to be gutted!

40:06.330 --> 40:10.232
To scrape yourself
up off the floor!

40:10.234 --> 40:12.868
I matter!

40:24.048 --> 40:26.482
(panting)

40:44.168 --> 40:45.768
(sighs softly)

40:48.339 --> 40:49.738
Oh.

40:53.911 --> 40:55.744
Shit!

40:55.746 --> 40:57.813
(laughs)

40:59.850 --> 41:00.949
Well, hello.

41:00.951 --> 41:03.085
What are you
doing here?

41:03.087 --> 41:05.954
How'd you get in?

41:05.956 --> 41:08.023
How'd I get in?

41:10.928 --> 41:13.429
You practically
dragged me up here.

41:15.399 --> 41:17.433
Or don't you remember it
that way?

41:20.771 --> 41:22.438
(Sally laughing)

41:39.723 --> 41:41.390
(panting)

41:41.392 --> 41:43.959
(lighter clicks)

41:49.633 --> 41:51.233
You need to go.

41:54.104 --> 41:55.437
What?

41:55.439 --> 41:57.806
You need to go.

41:57.808 --> 42:00.943
Oh, you prick.

42:00.945 --> 42:04.513
You're gonna pull that shit
after the things we did?

42:09.286 --> 42:11.820
Something real happened here.

42:11.822 --> 42:14.756
And it wasn't a dream.

42:14.758 --> 42:17.159
I don't remember anything.

42:19.096 --> 42:21.930
Anything at all.

42:23.934 --> 42:27.035
You're a goddamn liar.

42:27.037 --> 42:29.838
Oh, yes, you are.
You remember everything.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.941
Everything you did.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.714
And it's gonna happen again.

42:38.716 --> 42:41.617
And again and again.

42:41.619 --> 42:43.852
And you can't stop it.

42:43.854 --> 42:46.755
'Cause it's our destiny.

42:49.693 --> 42:52.060
And you can't fight destiny.

43:02.039 --> 43:04.106
(door closes)

43:06.076 --> 43:08.143
(elevator bell dings)

43:09.079 --> 43:10.579
I want to thank you, Liz.

43:10.581 --> 43:12.381
Sincerely.

43:12.383 --> 43:14.883
Your words truly
resonated with me.

43:14.885 --> 43:15.884
Aw.

43:15.886 --> 43:18.086
That's sweet
of you, doll.

43:18.088 --> 43:20.856
No, really.

43:20.858 --> 43:23.091
I feel changed.

43:23.093 --> 43:25.160
Deeply.

43:25.162 --> 43:26.862
(chuckles)

43:26.864 --> 43:28.163
Finally.

43:28.165 --> 43:29.898
(both laugh)

43:29.900 --> 43:31.900
Well, I did think
you might let the girl

43:31.902 --> 43:34.169
at the Lancôme counter
give you a makeover.

43:34.171 --> 43:36.905
But... sure,
this is good, too.

43:36.907 --> 43:39.274
You think I went too far.

43:39.276 --> 43:41.009
Not at all.

43:42.746 --> 43:46.415
Not... at... all.

43:58.529 --> 44:00.462
Oh.

44:00.464 --> 44:02.364
I hope this isn't plasma.

44:02.366 --> 44:05.233
This red is the Grenache blend

44:05.235 --> 44:07.469
(laughs): they never had
a chance to finish.

44:07.471 --> 44:09.104
Ooh.

44:12.643 --> 44:15.577
Well, I guess
I've come through it.

44:15.579 --> 44:17.779
(sighs)

44:17.781 --> 44:18.947
In fact,
I'm sure of it.

44:18.949 --> 44:20.315
Sure of what, honey?

44:20.317 --> 44:22.784
It's ironic.
Hmm?

44:22.786 --> 44:25.854
But I never knew how
to live until I died.

44:31.328 --> 44:34.229
That dress
fits you so well.

44:34.231 --> 44:36.832
Always been one of
my favorites.

44:37.768 --> 44:39.267
Holden,

44:39.269 --> 44:42.838
doesn't your mother
look pretty?

44:42.840 --> 44:44.906
Give her a little kiss.

44:59.757 --> 45:02.257
Mommy...

45:02.259 --> 45:04.493
you're just like me now.

45:06.463 --> 45:09.464
Yes, baby.

45:09.466 --> 45:11.833
I'm just like you.

45:11.835 --> 45:13.869
Does that mean
you'll stay with me forever?

45:13.871 --> 45:15.871
As long as your mommy
obeys the rules,

45:15.873 --> 45:19.474
she can stay as
long as she likes.

45:19.476 --> 45:21.977
It's very simple.

45:21.979 --> 45:25.147
You'll care for the children,
bathe them,

45:25.149 --> 45:28.316
keep them out of harm's way
as their new governess.

45:28.318 --> 45:30.986
The old one was
terrible for years.

45:30.988 --> 45:34.356
I should've removed
her long ago.

45:34.358 --> 45:37.025
Of course,
if you feel

45:37.027 --> 45:39.561
this burden's
too much to bear...

45:40.397 --> 45:41.897
No.

45:41.899 --> 45:44.332
No, it's no burden.

45:44.334 --> 45:45.500
Marvelous.

45:45.502 --> 45:46.902
Then it's settled.

45:46.904 --> 45:49.538
John lives in the hotel.

45:52.209 --> 45:54.476
I haven't told him anything.

45:54.478 --> 45:56.511
What if he sees me?

45:56.513 --> 45:59.414
You'd be amazed,
the wondrous possibilities

45:59.416 --> 46:03.752
that can begin
with a simple hello.

46:03.754 --> 46:05.721
(chuckles softly)

46:05.723 --> 46:07.923
Now, Holden,

46:07.925 --> 46:10.926
I believe it's past
your bedtime, darling.

46:10.928 --> 46:13.161
But we've only had
a minute together.

46:13.163 --> 46:16.098
You misunderstand, Alex.

46:17.935 --> 46:21.570
You and Holden
will have...

46:21.572 --> 46:23.505
<i> forever.</i>

46:23.507 --> 46:25.574

46:49.967 --> 46:52.033

47:11.622 --> 47:13.688
