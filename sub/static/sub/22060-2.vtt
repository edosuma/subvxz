WEBVTT

00:05.917 --> 00:08.684
Now, it's one thing to talk
about a piece of legislation,

00:08.686 --> 00:11.787
and talk and talk and talk.

00:13.024 --> 00:14.957
It's quite another thing--

00:14.959 --> 00:16.926
a far better thing, in my view--

00:16.928 --> 00:19.462
to put a story
and a face to the goals

00:19.464 --> 00:21.564
and aspirations
of that legislation.

00:21.566 --> 00:23.599
You really dig
this guy, huh?

00:23.601 --> 00:24.900
Yeah, he's
the real deal, yeah.

00:24.902 --> 00:27.169
Will you just...
just stop talking now?

00:27.171 --> 00:30.506
Andrea Rivas came to
this country from El Salvador

00:31.292 --> 00:34.727
with $80 and a dream.

00:34.729 --> 00:36.729
A dream shared by
countless others...

00:36.731 --> 00:38.797
You bring something for
him to autograph for you?

00:38.799 --> 00:39.898
Shut up.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.500
Team Walters.

00:41.502 --> 00:43.002
Needless to say,

00:43.004 --> 00:46.138
she tells this story
far better than I could.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.840
Andrea?

00:52.146 --> 00:54.213
Every team
needs a mascot.

00:54.215 --> 00:55.581
Seriously, Reagan,
shut up.

00:57.151 --> 00:59.952
Thank you, Congressman Walters.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:11.365 --> 01:12.598
Thanks, Joe.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.401
You got it, Danny.

01:15.403 --> 01:17.202
There are mushrooms on it.

01:17.204 --> 01:18.604
Thought you liked mushrooms.

01:18.606 --> 01:20.472
I do, but...

01:20.474 --> 01:23.175
We never used to get them
because of Mom.

01:24.979 --> 01:28.213
Look, this is...
never gonna get easier,

01:28.215 --> 01:30.616
but we do kind of have to start

01:30.618 --> 01:33.252
putting one foot
in front of the other, you know?

01:34.355 --> 01:35.788
Do you mean move on?

01:35.790 --> 01:37.089
I'm just saying
that I don't think

01:37.091 --> 01:39.391
Mom would want us
to stop living our lives.

01:39.393 --> 01:40.426
Right?

01:40.428 --> 01:41.860
It is pretty good.

01:41.862 --> 01:44.229
Danny, hey.

01:44.231 --> 01:45.964
Hey, Shelly, how you doing?

01:45.966 --> 01:47.666
- Hey, guys.
- Hello. - Hi.

01:47.668 --> 01:49.568
That service was so beautiful.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.804
I can't stop thinking
about it, even now.

01:51.806 --> 01:53.839
We appreciate it.
Thank you.

01:53.841 --> 01:55.507
Actually, Danny,
there was something

01:55.509 --> 01:57.476
I was hoping
to talk to you about.

01:57.478 --> 01:58.544
Okay.

02:01.349 --> 02:03.182
Boys, give me a second, okay?

02:03.184 --> 02:04.817
- See you guys later.
- Bye. - Bye.

02:04.819 --> 02:06.819
Go ahead, start eating.
I'll be right back, boys.

02:08.422 --> 02:10.055
What's up?

02:10.056 --> 02:11.890
You remember Leah Harris,
of course.

02:11.892 --> 02:14.927
Yeah. She's, uh, finally home
after all these years, right?

02:14.929 --> 02:16.895
What was it, 12 years
she was missing?

02:16.897 --> 02:17.709
13.

02:17.733 --> 02:19.332
Prayers answered.
That's a good thing.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.667
Linda and I used to spend a lot
of time over at the Harrises,

02:21.669 --> 02:23.135
especially after Leah ran away.

02:23.137 --> 02:24.136
Yeah, sure, I remember.

02:24.138 --> 02:25.371
My kids grew up
with their kids.

02:25.373 --> 02:27.139
I mean, we were close.

02:27.141 --> 02:29.375
W-What are you getting at here?

02:30.578 --> 02:34.546
Detective, whoever that girl is,
it isn't Leah.

02:34.548 --> 02:37.349
You're sure about that?

02:37.351 --> 02:39.351
As sure as the sun'll rise.

02:39.353 --> 02:41.854
Um, well, wouldn't her family
know if she wasn't the girl?

02:41.856 --> 02:44.723
Her mother is so happy
to have her back,

02:44.725 --> 02:46.058
I'm afraid she doesn't see

02:46.060 --> 02:48.394
that she's being taken in
by a con artist.

02:48.396 --> 02:50.195
Not for nothing,
but that's a little hard

02:50.197 --> 02:51.363
to believe, don't you think?

02:51.365 --> 02:53.499
I know how it sounds, Danny,
but please.

02:53.501 --> 02:56.402
I know Linda would have felt
the same way.

03:01.242 --> 03:04.676
Yeah. And she'd bring it up
until I relented.

03:16.791 --> 03:19.558
The mayor and the police
commissioner have always

03:19.560 --> 03:22.428
marched together in the
West Indian Day parade.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.295
Until now.

03:23.297 --> 03:24.830
Why until now?

03:24.832 --> 03:26.198
Nigel Morgan served time

03:26.200 --> 03:28.400
for the attempted murder
of police officers.

03:28.402 --> 03:31.136
Actually, for seditious
conspiracy, a nonviolent crime.

03:31.138 --> 03:33.505
Not to cops.
To cops, he is responsible

03:33.507 --> 03:36.141
for bombs aimed at cops,
end of story.

03:36.143 --> 03:37.176
He served his time.

03:37.178 --> 03:38.477
And now he is being honored.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.612
How do you think
my cops feel about that?

03:40.614 --> 03:42.948
I might point out,
it is not a cop parade.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.551
I assure you,
hundreds of them will be there.

03:45.553 --> 03:48.787
If it was some Sinn Féin thug
being honored

03:48.789 --> 03:50.756
at the St. Patty's Day parade,

03:50.758 --> 03:53.058
you'd be right out there
with the bagpipers.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.828
Not if he came after my people.

03:58.265 --> 04:00.065
I guess you could order me.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.300
I did, and I am.

04:01.302 --> 04:03.268
Well, then say it out loud,

04:03.270 --> 04:05.204
in an official press release.

04:05.206 --> 04:06.371
The PC,

04:06.373 --> 04:08.941
under your pressure,
has agreed to march

04:08.943 --> 04:12.010
for the greater good
of the West Indian community,

04:12.012 --> 04:17.249
but under strong protest for
any honors offered Nigel Morgan.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.750
"The greater good"?

04:18.752 --> 04:21.786
Something like that.
Put some mustard on the wording.

04:21.789 --> 04:23.989
I thought
you didn't play politics.

04:23.991 --> 04:25.424
I wouldn't say
I speak French, either,

04:25.426 --> 04:27.159
but I can get by in a pinch.

04:27.161 --> 04:28.794
<i>L'addition, s'il vous plait.</i>

04:28.796 --> 04:29.795
I don't speak French.

04:29.797 --> 04:31.997
He said, "The bill, please."

04:36.403 --> 04:38.337
It's on the house.

04:38.339 --> 04:41.640
<i>Look, I don't mind</i>
<i>being on protective detail.</i>

04:41.642 --> 04:42.908
<i>I'm just saying,</i>

04:42.910 --> 04:45.410
no matter the cause,
a politician is a politician.

04:45.412 --> 04:47.546
You can't deny
that he's helping people.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.481
I can't deny
that's the soap he's selling.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.770
Andrea. Andrea!

05:18.579 --> 05:19.954
Everything all right?

05:19.955 --> 05:21.955
Oh, there's no trouble
at all, Officers.

05:21.957 --> 05:24.157
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

05:33.235 --> 05:36.636
Linda was a wonderful friend
to me over the years.

05:36.638 --> 05:38.171
Yeah, she was
a good friend.

05:38.173 --> 05:39.973
She had that gift.

05:39.975 --> 05:41.641
And she'd be very happy about

05:41.643 --> 05:43.310
the good news
for the neighborhood.

05:43.312 --> 05:45.045
Yes, she would've.

05:45.047 --> 05:47.314
I've waited for this moment
for so long.

05:47.316 --> 05:50.016
I always knew
Leah was still alive.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.751
I never gave up hope.

05:51.753 --> 05:52.819
That's good.

05:55.958 --> 05:57.624
Detective Reagan,

05:57.626 --> 05:58.892
this is Leah.

05:58.894 --> 06:00.760
And I don't know if you
remember my son, Luke?

06:00.762 --> 06:02.495
Yeah, I do. Actually,
I remember both of you.

06:02.497 --> 06:05.232
But last time I saw you,
you were just kids this big.

06:06.097 --> 06:07.201
Nice to meet you again,
Detective.

06:07.202 --> 06:08.235
You, too.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.203
Hello.

06:10.205 --> 06:11.438
Leah, we're really all glad

06:11.440 --> 06:13.240
that you decided
to come back home.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.374
Thank you.

06:14.376 --> 06:15.609
It's not such a bad place

06:15.611 --> 06:16.943
to live after all, right?

06:21.016 --> 06:23.550
You have to forgive her;
she's tired.

06:23.552 --> 06:27.420
Yeah, bedside manner's never
been my strong suit. Sorry.

06:27.422 --> 06:28.555
Go check on her.

06:28.557 --> 06:30.724
Good to see you.
Get you a drink?

06:30.726 --> 06:32.859
No, no, it's, uh...

06:32.861 --> 06:34.995
a little, uh,
early for me.

06:34.997 --> 06:37.897
You say, uh, she came back
a couple weeks ago?

06:37.899 --> 06:39.266
12 days today.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.035
Wow. Any idea
why she left?

06:42.037 --> 06:44.204
I'm just happy
that's what it was.

06:44.206 --> 06:46.172
You go through
all the scenarios

06:46.174 --> 06:47.173
when something
like this happens.

06:47.175 --> 06:49.776
Did she get kidnapped,
or worse?

06:49.778 --> 06:52.279
Right. I... can't even imagine.

06:52.281 --> 06:56.249
I'm just glad she's home,
where she belongs.

06:56.251 --> 06:58.785
Uh, photo albums?

06:58.787 --> 07:00.253
- Yeah.
- Mind if I take a look?

07:00.255 --> 07:01.755
Oh, be my guest.

07:02.924 --> 07:05.058
Cute.

07:05.060 --> 07:08.695
Um, looks like some pictures
have been taken out.

07:08.697 --> 07:10.430
Leah made herself a notebook
to remind herself

07:10.432 --> 07:11.765
of friends and family.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.099
Good idea.

07:14.536 --> 07:16.303
Why do you think
she came home now?

07:16.305 --> 07:19.005
Well, she'd been living
in homeless shelters.

07:19.007 --> 07:21.341
Moving from town to town

07:21.343 --> 07:22.942
with a group of drifters.
Right.

07:22.944 --> 07:24.978
I think she got
fed up with that life.

07:24.980 --> 07:26.513
Yeah, I bet.

07:27.683 --> 07:30.450
Is there another reason
you're here, Detective?

07:36.725 --> 07:38.925
Is she how you remembered her?

07:41.863 --> 07:45.498
13 years changes people.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.235
I expect we'll both have to
get to know one another again.

07:50.539 --> 07:52.472
I guess so.

07:57.746 --> 08:01.746
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ Blue Bloods 8x02 ♪</font></b>

08:15.842 --> 08:18.756
She ran away
in August of 2004

08:18.757 --> 08:21.291
while at a sleepover camp
on Staten Island.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.326
The family checked
her into camp,

08:23.328 --> 08:24.761
but later that night
she went missing.

08:24.763 --> 08:26.730
No suspicion of foul play,
nothing like that?

08:26.732 --> 08:28.198
We didn't rule
anything out,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.567
but the girl had run away
from home a few times before.

08:30.569 --> 08:31.968
This just seemed to be
more of the same.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.203
- Have a seat.
- There was no sign of her after that?

08:34.206 --> 08:36.840
None. Though not for
lack of effort.

08:36.842 --> 08:39.075
The mom would come back to me
about the investigation

08:39.077 --> 08:40.977
about a hundred times
a year.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.078
Right.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.114
Why are you asking all this now?

08:44.116 --> 08:45.782
The case is finally closed.

08:45.784 --> 08:48.385
Look, is there any possibility

08:48.387 --> 08:50.754
that the girl who returned home
isn't Leah?

08:50.756 --> 08:52.822
So that's why you two
called me here.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.758
A neighbor of the Harrises
raised some concern.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.092
Shelly Elwood?

08:56.094 --> 08:58.762
Yeah, Shelly Elwood. Why?

08:58.764 --> 09:00.530
She already talk to you?

09:00.532 --> 09:03.133
To me, her local precinct;
now to you, it seems.

09:03.135 --> 09:06.136
You ask me, she's got
too much time on her hands.

09:06.138 --> 09:07.704
Maybe she does have
too much time on her hands,

09:07.706 --> 09:10.640
but I will say,
she did seem pretty convinced.

09:10.642 --> 09:12.542
Regardless, the bottom line is

09:12.544 --> 09:15.011
Leah's DNA matched
the one we had on file.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.948
Great, so you did a DNA test.
Anything else?

09:17.950 --> 09:20.450
Yes, we also had a redundancy.

09:20.452 --> 09:21.985
We showed her pictures
of family and friends,

09:21.987 --> 09:24.220
and she was able
to name them all independently.

09:24.222 --> 09:26.122
Well, I guess that's that.

09:26.124 --> 09:28.858
She was able to name
them <i>all</i> independently?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.393
Not a single slip-up.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.862
And that didn't
seem weird to you?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.297
What do you mean?

09:34.299 --> 09:35.732
Well, she's been
gone 13 years,

09:35.734 --> 09:38.034
she looks at a bunch
of pictures of people

09:38.036 --> 09:39.836
she hasn't seen in 13 years,

09:39.838 --> 09:42.372
she names all of them
without any slip-ups?

09:42.374 --> 09:45.041
Well, maybe she spent
a lot of long nights

09:45.043 --> 09:47.844
doing just that,
going over memories.

09:47.846 --> 09:49.479
I don't know
what you hope

09:49.481 --> 09:52.182
to find here, Detectives,
but Leah checks out.

09:52.184 --> 09:54.417
Now, if there's nothing else,

09:54.419 --> 09:57.053
I have a few other cases
that need my attention.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.929
We can't just
let this go.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.064
Jamie.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.466
- I got to say something.
- Hey!

10:09.468 --> 10:11.434
A couple questions.
What's the big deal?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.470
Oh, I don't know, we could
get thrown off the detail.

10:13.472 --> 10:15.805
Come on, what we saw
wasn't nothing.

10:15.807 --> 10:17.674
Our job is to protect
the congressman,

10:17.676 --> 10:19.442
not to investigate him.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.710
Maybe he's the distressed party.

10:20.712 --> 10:22.245
Won't know if we don't ask.

10:23.849 --> 10:26.049
Ah.

10:26.051 --> 10:27.484
Two of New York's finest.

10:27.486 --> 10:29.953
I feel very safe
under your watchful eyes.

10:29.955 --> 10:31.254
Proud to serve,
Congressman.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.857
Oh, please, call me
Richard, Officer Janko

10:33.859 --> 10:35.225
and Reagan. Reagan.

10:35.227 --> 10:36.860
Are you any relation
to the commissioner?

10:36.862 --> 10:38.395
Yes, sir. He's my father.
Oh.

10:38.397 --> 10:40.463
Well, I admire
what he's done in this city,

10:40.465 --> 10:42.999
and I think his example should
be followed through the country.

10:43.001 --> 10:44.300
I agree.

10:44.302 --> 10:46.336
So, what can I do for you?

10:46.338 --> 10:47.937
Last night,

10:47.939 --> 10:50.540
after your speech...
Oh, I know. I know.

10:50.542 --> 10:53.877
These roadshows, everybody's
nerves gets frazzled.

10:53.879 --> 10:56.546
Is everything okay?

10:56.548 --> 10:58.014
Oh, absolutely.

10:58.016 --> 10:59.049
Then how come

10:59.051 --> 11:00.917
Andrea jumped out
of a moving car?

11:00.919 --> 11:01.951
Jamie.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.119
No. That's okay.

11:03.889 --> 11:06.423
Um...

11:08.060 --> 11:10.293
Congressman.

11:12.197 --> 11:13.596
I promised Andrea

11:13.598 --> 11:15.965
that I would get her family
into the country,

11:15.967 --> 11:17.901
but that's proven difficult,

11:17.903 --> 11:19.169
especially in
the current climate.

11:19.171 --> 11:22.972
So, understandably,
she's frustrated.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.641
Ever any concern for
your safety with her?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.209
Oh, gosh, no.

11:26.211 --> 11:27.343
Okay.

11:27.345 --> 11:29.045
So, you're sure,
there's nothing?

11:29.047 --> 11:32.916
Nothing but good people
trying to do good work.

11:32.918 --> 11:35.085
Congressman, may I?

11:35.087 --> 11:37.387
Of course.
New York's finest.

11:43.562 --> 11:45.195
Good night, Reagan.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.429
Hey, hey, wait.

11:46.431 --> 11:48.998
Hey, look, I know
you think I'm crazy,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.734
but I-I remember-- when I
spoke to the mom, she told me

11:51.736 --> 11:53.903
that Leah put together a
scrapbook full of pictures

11:53.905 --> 11:56.039
of family and friends so
she could remember them.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.574
Okay.

11:57.576 --> 11:59.242
Well, why would
she need to do that

11:59.244 --> 12:01.344
if she already remembered them
without a single slip-up?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.280
Like she used the scrapbook
as a cheat sheet?

12:04.282 --> 12:06.549
Makes sense.
Well, come on.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.518
You got to admit,
something doesn't add up.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.855
What <i>does</i> add up is
the DNA evidence, Danny.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.123
That could be faked.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.492
How? Do you hear yourself
right now?

12:15.494 --> 12:18.328
Look, Linda and Shelly spent
a lot of time with this family.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.562
Shelly wouldn't say

12:19.564 --> 12:21.431
that something was off,
not for nothing.

12:21.433 --> 12:24.834
Don't get in over your head
for the wrong reasons.

12:24.836 --> 12:26.436
Come on.
What is that supposed to mean?

12:26.438 --> 12:29.873
Shelly was the one that
brought this to you, not Linda.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.708
Go home,

12:31.710 --> 12:32.942
be with your boys.

12:32.944 --> 12:34.611
Get some rest, okay?
Mm-hmm.

12:40.485 --> 12:42.452
Sir?

12:42.454 --> 12:44.320
Who is it?

12:44.322 --> 12:45.255
Me, sir.

12:45.257 --> 12:47.056
No, I meant, who's my 5:00?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.791
Me, sir.

12:48.793 --> 12:51.027
Oh.

12:51.029 --> 12:54.731
And Retired Detective
First Grade Joseph Polito.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.237
Hello, Joe.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.272
Commissioner.

13:02.274 --> 13:03.506
My godfather.

13:03.508 --> 13:05.074
Oh.

13:06.311 --> 13:08.211
Please, sit down.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.021
I don't <i>think</i> we've ever met.

13:18.023 --> 13:19.422
No.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.258
Detective Polito
was severely injured

13:22.260 --> 13:24.861
in the bombing Nigel
Morgan masterminded.

13:24.863 --> 13:28.198
Which is why
I would know the name.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.500
This is not my idea.
Uncle Joe.

13:30.502 --> 13:32.035
I want the commissioner
to know that.

13:32.037 --> 13:33.836
Consider me informed.

13:33.838 --> 13:35.371
Sir, this is about...

13:35.373 --> 13:37.507
Who's being honored
in the West Indian Day parade.

13:37.509 --> 13:39.943
Which is just wrong.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.447
Joe?

13:44.449 --> 13:47.417
My goddaughter insisted
I register a complaint.

13:47.419 --> 13:49.752
Consider it done, thank you.

13:49.754 --> 13:50.853
Believe me, I hear you.

13:50.855 --> 13:53.089
But you understand,
I have to hear them.

13:53.091 --> 13:54.224
It's their community.

13:54.226 --> 13:56.392
They have a right
to honor anyone they choose.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.194
That doesn't mean you
have to walk with them.

13:58.196 --> 13:59.829
His crimes have already
been adjudicated.

13:59.831 --> 14:01.831
With all due
respect, sir,

14:01.833 --> 14:04.367
my godfather's left leg
has been adjudicated.

14:04.369 --> 14:05.301
Abby.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.404
Uncle Joe.

14:08.406 --> 14:10.406
I'm sorry, but you are family.

14:10.408 --> 14:15.445
And the commissioner understands
that better than anybody I know.

14:19.351 --> 14:21.918
Are you asking me
to boycott the parade?

14:21.920 --> 14:25.255
I wouldn't be so bold,
Commissioner.

14:27.025 --> 14:29.459
But <i>you</i> would?

14:29.461 --> 14:32.295
All day long, sir.

14:38.970 --> 14:41.237
Ugh. Aw!

14:41.239 --> 14:43.106
It really looks great.

14:43.108 --> 14:44.741
Aah! God...

14:44.743 --> 14:46.342
Dad.

14:49.047 --> 14:50.513
Yay.
Thank you. Thank you.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.582
It's terrible.
Oh, I know.

14:52.584 --> 14:54.150
It's not your mom's
chicken cutlets, but it'll do.

14:54.152 --> 14:56.819
Dad, we could just
order Chinese. I mean...

14:56.821 --> 14:59.255
Why? All we got to do is
scrape off the burned stuff,

14:59.257 --> 15:00.256
and it's as good as new.

15:00.258 --> 15:02.892
Yeah, I like it extra crispy.

15:02.894 --> 15:04.694
Exactly. See, there you go.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.657
What are you doing?

15:05.681 --> 15:07.298
Taking pictures for
my friends. I mean...

15:07.299 --> 15:10.166
Don't take pictures for your
friends of the burnt chicken!

15:10.168 --> 15:11.907
Have to. A picture's
worth a thousand words.

15:12.103 --> 15:13.269
Oh, send... Send that one to me.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.071
Yeah.

15:15.073 --> 15:17.006
Picture is worth
a thousand words, isn't it?

15:17.008 --> 15:18.441
You know what?

15:18.443 --> 15:19.942
Forget the chicken.

15:19.944 --> 15:21.377
Uh, I'll pick up

15:21.379 --> 15:22.745
some Chinese takeout,

15:22.747 --> 15:24.147
but I got to make a stop, okay?

15:24.149 --> 15:26.582
Uh, turn off the oven
and throw the chicken away.

15:26.584 --> 15:28.718
You're still gonna eat it?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.321
I'm still gonna eat it.

15:31.323 --> 15:33.656
I was heading
to the store and figured

15:33.658 --> 15:36.559
I'd come by and see if
I might have left it here.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.395
I understand. I misplace
my phone all the time.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.297
Right. Uh, I was
sitting here.

15:41.299 --> 15:42.699
Do you mind if I peek?
No.

15:42.701 --> 15:45.335
Okay, great.
Yeah, no luck.

15:45.337 --> 15:48.604
You think maybe one of the kids
might've grabbed it by accident?

15:48.606 --> 15:51.107
I just got Leah one.
She could've mixed it up.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.342
Her bedroom's upstairs.

15:52.344 --> 15:53.843
Hmm. Great.

15:56.047 --> 15:58.414
Um, do you mind if
I use a-a restroom?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.450
Well, you can use Leah's.
It's right there.

16:00.452 --> 16:03.319
Great. Thank you.

16:35.854 --> 16:38.588
You know, I think
I remember where I left it.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.356
Are you sure?
Yeah.

16:40.358 --> 16:41.858
I'm pretty sure.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.292
Thanks for your
help, though.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.730
Well, I'll let you know
if it turns up here.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.754
Great.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.034
Hey, you're gonna get us
thrown off the detail.

16:52.036 --> 16:54.003
I'm trying to do
the job of a detail--

16:54.005 --> 16:56.245
to protect the people that
we're charged with protecting.

17:00.378 --> 17:01.778
How's it going?

17:01.780 --> 17:03.446
It's going.

17:03.448 --> 17:05.848
You like driving
for the congressman?

17:05.849 --> 17:08.851
Sure. Been good for
some stories over the years.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.421
Any stories
worth sharing?

17:17.295 --> 17:20.061
What is it that you're after?

17:20.064 --> 17:21.597
We were wondering
about last night.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.465
That's none of your business,
or mine.

17:23.468 --> 17:25.268
It's our business
to keep the congressman safe.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.303
Then why don't you do
what you're paid to do,

17:27.305 --> 17:30.573
drive along behind
and don't ask questions.

17:30.575 --> 17:31.808
Look, nobody gets
out of a moving car

17:31.810 --> 17:32.909
without a good reason.

17:32.911 --> 17:34.977
There something
that you're failing

17:34.979 --> 17:37.747
to report to the congressman's
NYPD detail?

17:38.650 --> 17:40.149
Look, are they having an affair?

17:40.151 --> 17:42.452
What's so funny?

17:42.454 --> 17:44.287
Walters is one of those guys
that doesn't believe

17:44.289 --> 17:46.689
a man should be alone with
a woman that isn't his wife.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.024
Then what?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.559
I just told you,
I don't speak Spanish.

17:49.561 --> 17:51.194
Look, I respect loyalty
more than anyone,

17:51.196 --> 17:52.895
but if the congressman
is hurting her...

17:52.897 --> 17:55.131
You two have got it all wrong.
How?

17:55.133 --> 17:58.034
As far as I can tell,

17:58.036 --> 18:00.770
it's the congressman's back
that's against the wall.

18:08.717 --> 18:10.683
<i>You went digging around</i>
<i>in their trash?</i>

18:10.685 --> 18:12.251
The DNA didn't match Leah

18:12.253 --> 18:13.418
or anyone else in
the Harris family.

18:13.419 --> 18:15.588
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

18:15.590 --> 18:17.156
Came back to a
Selena Moore,

18:17.158 --> 18:19.926
who's got a history of priors,
including prostitution.

18:19.928 --> 18:21.828
How did Ann not recognize
her own daughter?

18:21.830 --> 18:23.129
I get it.

18:23.131 --> 18:25.632
She's desperate to put
her family back together.

18:25.634 --> 18:29.102
As crazy as it sounds,
I kind of understand.

18:29.104 --> 18:32.305
Okay, but how did this Selena
beat the DNA test?

18:32.307 --> 18:35.475
You ask me, she had help.

18:37.212 --> 18:39.012
The Sergeant's Union
just joined the fray.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.513
It's a trifecta.

18:40.515 --> 18:41.748
What'd they say?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.349
Same thing as the Patrolman's
and the Detectives.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.585
The PC should not
march in the parade.

18:45.587 --> 18:47.520
I thought the mayor's statement
was very clear.

18:47.522 --> 18:49.188
I am marching under protest.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.223
But still marching, under...

18:50.225 --> 18:51.924
<i>And</i> under orders.

18:51.926 --> 18:54.827
The next time you want to throw
a slider, check with me first?

18:54.829 --> 18:56.729
I would've worked
with Carlton on the wording.

18:56.731 --> 18:57.830
I didn't want us involved.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.632
It had to come exclusively
from City Hall.

18:59.634 --> 19:01.204
Well, we are involved,
like it or not.

19:01.205 --> 19:04.004
What about Baker's godfather?
How you gonna look her in the eye?

19:04.005 --> 19:05.638
Same way I'm looking you
in the eye.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.473
Well, say that he boycotts.
What do you think

19:07.475 --> 19:09.442
that's gonna do with the cops
on the parade detail?

19:09.444 --> 19:10.777
- Not good.
- Not good?

19:10.779 --> 19:12.245
It's like throwing gasoline

19:12.247 --> 19:14.781
on the most volatile event
on the calendar.

19:14.783 --> 19:15.815
What do you want to do?

19:15.817 --> 19:18.184
Get out of town.
That an option?

19:18.186 --> 19:20.920
It's not a real question.

19:23.525 --> 19:25.391
She wasn't here
when I woke up this morning.

19:25.393 --> 19:26.759
Did she mention anything
about leaving?

19:26.761 --> 19:27.994
Nothing.

19:27.996 --> 19:29.095
What about, uh, Luke?

19:29.097 --> 19:30.296
Is there any chance
she's with him?

19:30.298 --> 19:32.165
No, he's in his apartment
in Manhattan.

19:32.167 --> 19:33.599
He hasn't seen her.

19:34.469 --> 19:37.670
Oh, God.

19:37.672 --> 19:39.939
What if she's left me again?

19:41.176 --> 19:42.909
Did she have access
to a car, Ms. Harris?

19:42.911 --> 19:45.011
Just mine. It's still here.

19:45.013 --> 19:48.381
Okay, earlier, you told me that
you-you got her a cell phone.

19:48.383 --> 19:50.049
I've called.
It rings straight through.

19:50.051 --> 19:51.284
Okay,

19:51.286 --> 19:54.220
this might sound a little weird,
but is she on your plan?

19:54.222 --> 19:56.022
Like, a family plan
kind of thing?

19:56.024 --> 19:57.957
Yeah.
Okay, can I see the phone?

19:59.561 --> 20:02.729
These family plans-- they have
a phone finder thing now.

20:02.731 --> 20:04.464
It works for
anybody on the plan.

20:04.466 --> 20:06.099
Maybe we could
find her that way.

20:06.101 --> 20:07.333
You moonlighting
for AT&T now?

20:07.335 --> 20:09.902
My kids lose their
phones all the time.

20:10.872 --> 20:12.772
Thank you.

20:21.082 --> 20:23.549
I thought the event
wasn't for another hour.

20:23.551 --> 20:26.119
Actually, Andrea, we wanted
to ask you a few questions.

20:26.121 --> 20:29.122
Am I in trouble, Officers?

20:29.124 --> 20:33.593
We saw your fight with the
congressman the other night.

20:34.996 --> 20:36.395
Did you threaten him, Andrea?

20:36.397 --> 20:38.598
What? Why would I?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.800
Because he didn't make
good on his promise

20:40.802 --> 20:42.468
to bring your
family over.

20:42.470 --> 20:44.704
But that's the whole reason
I'm working for him.

20:44.706 --> 20:47.273
That I'm away from my children.
Why would I risk that?

20:47.275 --> 20:49.108
Then what was the fight about?

20:49.110 --> 20:51.477
I'm not supposed
to say anything.

20:51.479 --> 20:52.912
Says who?

20:52.914 --> 20:54.113
I-I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

20:54.115 --> 20:55.948
I'm going to get in trouble.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.416
With the congressman?

20:59.487 --> 21:02.155
Is there something else
going on here, Andrea?

21:03.892 --> 21:05.858
I'm trapped.

21:05.860 --> 21:06.859
Trapped how?

21:06.861 --> 21:08.127
He brought me here

21:08.129 --> 21:10.763
to be the face of his campaign,
but that was months ago.

21:10.765 --> 21:12.198
And he still doesn't

21:12.200 --> 21:14.801
let me leave or see my family.

21:16.104 --> 21:17.804
He doesn't even pay me.

21:17.806 --> 21:19.338
Wait.

21:19.340 --> 21:21.941
He doesn't pay you?

21:21.943 --> 21:24.177
Only what he
wants, when he wants.

21:24.179 --> 21:25.878
But there's
nothing I can do.

21:27.015 --> 21:29.482
He controls my visa.

21:29.484 --> 21:31.050
So if you fight back,
he'll send you home.

21:31.052 --> 21:33.519
Yes.

21:33.521 --> 21:35.688
We can... we can
report this, Andrea.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.757
No, please.

21:37.759 --> 21:38.858
Let us help you.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.127
You'll only get me in trouble.

21:41.129 --> 21:42.795
Please, just leave me alone.

21:42.797 --> 21:44.831
Please.

21:49.571 --> 21:52.438
False, to Francoise.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.308
Uh, four letters,
ending in "X."

21:55.310 --> 21:57.376
"Faux."

21:57.378 --> 21:59.579
"Foe" doesn't
end in "X."

21:59.581 --> 22:00.680
F-A-U-X.

22:00.682 --> 22:01.747
That "faux."

22:01.749 --> 22:03.883
Ah.

22:03.885 --> 22:06.385
Francoise.

22:08.423 --> 22:10.590
Look, I know you've been
taking a lot of flack

22:10.592 --> 22:12.458
about walking
in the parade,

22:12.460 --> 22:13.993
so I thought maybe you
didn't need to hear

22:13.995 --> 22:15.862
any more of it at home.

22:15.864 --> 22:17.663
Actually, I got
a question about it.

22:17.665 --> 22:18.631
Yeah?

22:18.633 --> 22:21.000
I'm sure
you remember Joe Polito.

22:21.002 --> 22:22.535
Sure.
Yeah, well,

22:22.537 --> 22:23.769
Baker brought him in.

22:23.771 --> 22:25.171
Turns out he's her godfather.

22:25.173 --> 22:26.739
Small world.

22:26.741 --> 22:28.107
Yeah.

22:28.109 --> 22:30.309
So, what's the question?
Well...

22:30.311 --> 22:33.813
He's supposed to be
the injured party,

22:33.815 --> 22:36.082
but Baker did
almost all the talking.

22:36.084 --> 22:38.384
Kind of like she had
to drag him in there.

22:38.386 --> 22:40.086
Huh.

22:40.088 --> 22:42.822
I don't know.
Must be the cop in me, but...

22:42.824 --> 22:45.258
I just felt
he was hiding something.

22:46.628 --> 22:49.662
Who arrested Morgan for
the bombing that injured Polito?

22:49.664 --> 22:51.464
Polito's partner, um,

22:51.466 --> 22:53.432
uh, S... uh, Ray Solomon.

22:53.434 --> 22:55.134
Just solid police work?

22:55.136 --> 22:56.569
Far as I know.

22:56.571 --> 22:59.005
Go further for me, Pop.

22:59.007 --> 23:03.709
Well, Morgan was a sworn enemy
of the NYPD.

23:03.711 --> 23:08.080
There were rumors about the
collar after he went to prison.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.516
So I had my people look into it.

23:10.518 --> 23:14.020
But all that came back,
from all levels,

23:14.022 --> 23:17.757
was that Polito and his partner
did their jobs.

23:17.759 --> 23:19.258
So you were satisfied?

23:19.260 --> 23:20.526
Put it this way:

23:20.528 --> 23:22.161
satisfied enough

23:22.163 --> 23:26.632
that I didn't want to turn my
department upside down over it.

23:28.603 --> 23:30.803
I slept fine.

23:44.619 --> 23:45.851
Is that her?

23:45.853 --> 23:46.686
Yeah, it's her.

23:46.688 --> 23:47.954
Selena Moore!

23:47.956 --> 23:49.922
Selena Moore!
Police! Wait!

23:49.924 --> 23:51.457
Wait!

23:51.459 --> 23:54.627
Hey! Hey!

23:54.629 --> 23:56.028
Police!

23:56.030 --> 23:57.930
Stop the bus!

23:58.633 --> 23:59.532
Hey!

23:59.534 --> 24:01.133
Stop the bus now!

24:01.135 --> 24:02.668
Stop the bus! Police!

24:02.670 --> 24:04.437
Open the door!

24:10.311 --> 24:12.044
Ladies and gentlemen, police.

24:12.046 --> 24:14.347
Everybody stay in your seats.

24:14.349 --> 24:15.915
Remain calm, okay?

24:15.917 --> 24:17.316
Everything's under control.

24:17.318 --> 24:19.185
Put your hands
inside the seat, sir.

24:19.187 --> 24:21.220
- Yes, sir.
- Have you on your way in a second.

24:21.222 --> 24:22.655
Selena Moore?

24:22.657 --> 24:26.158
Selena Moore,
you got nowhere to go.

24:33.334 --> 24:34.767
Selena Moore, police.

24:34.769 --> 24:37.603
Let me see your hands.
Come on. Get 'em up.

24:40.008 --> 24:42.775
All right. I want you to slowly
get on your feet. Come on.

24:42.777 --> 24:43.943
All right.

24:43.945 --> 24:44.844
Come on out.

24:44.846 --> 24:45.945
Hands behind
your back.

24:45.947 --> 24:47.947
Put your hands
behind your back.

24:47.949 --> 24:49.715
Selena Moore,
you're under arrest

24:49.717 --> 24:51.984
for criminal impersonation.

24:51.986 --> 24:54.120
Get her out of here.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.410
You've been
collared for prostitution

25:00.411 --> 25:01.877
in three different
states. Wow!

25:01.879 --> 25:04.780
Quite the upstanding
life you've lived, Leah.

25:04.782 --> 25:06.882
Oh, I'm sorry. Selena.

25:06.884 --> 25:09.118
Well, I know I'm no saint...

25:09.120 --> 25:10.419
No saint? Come on.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.921
You're preying on
an innocent woman

25:11.923 --> 25:14.990
by impersonating her missing
daughter of 13 years!

25:14.992 --> 25:16.625
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

25:16.627 --> 25:18.294
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

25:18.296 --> 25:19.728
Of course she did.
This little scam of yours

25:19.730 --> 25:21.063
took a lot of planning,
didn't it?

25:21.065 --> 25:22.731
So why don't you tell me
how you did it.

25:22.733 --> 25:23.999
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:24.001 --> 25:25.000
Really?

25:25.002 --> 25:26.769
You fooled Missing Persons.

25:26.771 --> 25:28.871
You passed
the DNA test.

25:28.873 --> 25:30.005
How'd you do it?!

25:30.007 --> 25:31.373
And who helped you?

25:31.375 --> 25:32.808
No one.

25:32.810 --> 25:34.343
Who helped you?!

25:35.646 --> 25:38.847
Or should I say...

25:38.849 --> 25:42.351
why did he help you?

25:42.353 --> 25:44.420
Who?

25:44.422 --> 25:45.721
Oh, I don't know,

25:45.723 --> 25:47.856
your "brother,"

25:47.858 --> 25:49.925
Luke Harris, maybe?

25:54.398 --> 25:56.398
He offered me money.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.334
Ah.

26:01.305 --> 26:03.305
He was a regular john.

26:03.307 --> 26:06.075
Used to call me to his apartment
in Staten Island all the time.

26:06.077 --> 26:08.277
Then, one day,
he offers me $10,000

26:08.279 --> 26:10.512
to pretend to be his sister
for a couple weeks.

26:10.514 --> 26:12.982
His mother said he lives
in Manhattan, not Staten Island.

26:12.984 --> 26:14.650
I'm telling you,
it was his apartment.

26:14.652 --> 26:16.218
He and his friends
would do drugs

26:16.220 --> 26:17.820
and party and...

26:17.822 --> 26:19.588
and call us girls over.

26:19.590 --> 26:22.291
Still doesn't explain why
he would trick his own mother.

26:22.293 --> 26:24.560
I don't know. I didn't ask.

26:24.562 --> 26:26.528
So, tell me, how'd you
and your big brother

26:26.530 --> 26:28.831
beat the DNA test?

26:28.833 --> 26:31.400
He gave me a lock of hair.

26:32.603 --> 26:35.270
Gave you a lock of...

26:35.272 --> 26:37.740
his sister Leah's hair?

26:37.742 --> 26:38.807
Yes.

26:38.809 --> 26:40.409
I swear,

26:40.411 --> 26:42.244
I've told you everything I know.

26:43.781 --> 26:45.748
Why did you cover for him?

26:47.018 --> 26:50.252
After you came around,
he got real angry.

26:50.254 --> 26:52.454
Threatened me to keep quiet.

26:53.924 --> 26:55.357
When you found me
at the bus stop,

26:55.359 --> 26:57.192
it wasn't you
I was running from.

27:08.506 --> 27:10.739
Baker?

27:13.611 --> 27:16.111
Sit down.

27:23.287 --> 27:25.954
I was thinking about
your Uncle Joe.

27:25.956 --> 27:27.623
What about him?

27:27.625 --> 27:29.291
Well, I'm sure on
special occasions and holidays,

27:29.293 --> 27:31.693
he would always
get around to the story

27:31.695 --> 27:35.264
of how he and his partner
took down Nigel Morgan.

27:35.266 --> 27:36.565
Every gory detail.

27:36.567 --> 27:39.168
Between that and the turkey,
I always need a nap after.

27:39.170 --> 27:41.537
He hardly said two words
in here.

27:41.539 --> 27:43.038
He's shy.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.307
Shy about the man
who wrecked his leg?

27:45.309 --> 27:47.776
Shy about Nigel Morgan
being honored?

27:47.778 --> 27:49.378
You can be intimidating, sir.

27:49.380 --> 27:54.249
Between the office
and the title and...

27:54.251 --> 27:56.585
you of the whole thing.

27:57.488 --> 28:00.055
I didn't have
my intimidating face on.

28:00.057 --> 28:03.525
I see lots of people
when they walk out that door.

28:08.265 --> 28:10.732
It turns out, at the time,

28:10.734 --> 28:13.368
there were some questions
about the arrest.

28:13.370 --> 28:15.070
You saying Morgan was innocent?

28:15.072 --> 28:18.373
No. That son of a bitch
was guilty.

28:18.375 --> 28:21.443
But possible questions
about the chain of evidence

28:21.445 --> 28:23.479
that led to the trial.

28:23.481 --> 28:26.248
And are there answers
in that envelope?

28:26.250 --> 28:28.250
I don't know.

28:28.252 --> 28:30.085
I haven't opened it.

28:30.087 --> 28:31.720
I don't intend to.

28:33.924 --> 28:35.624
If there were nothing
to the rumors,

28:35.626 --> 28:37.392
this would be pretty flat.

28:37.394 --> 28:38.961
It's not.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.234
You figure this lets you
off the hook with me?

28:45.236 --> 28:46.335
It's not about that.

28:46.337 --> 28:47.569
Then what?

28:47.571 --> 28:49.505
Respect. That you'd
rather have information

28:49.507 --> 28:51.406
than be protected from it.

28:51.408 --> 28:54.309
Whatever it is or isn't,

28:54.311 --> 28:56.478
thanks but no thanks.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.847
Then shred it.

29:01.785 --> 29:04.586
Abigail,

29:04.588 --> 29:07.723
I'm going to march
in that parade.

29:10.394 --> 29:12.561
If that's all?

29:13.998 --> 29:16.465
That's all.

29:23.274 --> 29:27.442
Uncle Joe is the godfather
who was chosen for me.

29:27.444 --> 29:30.879
You are the godfather
I have chosen myself.

29:33.350 --> 29:37.252
I have to accept
what comes with that.

29:48.265 --> 29:50.399
Andrea's options
are limited.

29:50.401 --> 29:53.635
She's here on a H-1B visa,
which the congressman

29:53.637 --> 29:55.671
probably pulled
a lot of strings to get.

29:55.673 --> 29:56.427
Mm-hmm.

29:56.451 --> 29:58.340
What if she just quit
and walked away?

29:58.642 --> 30:01.210
Then the visa would be void
and she'd be sent home.

30:01.212 --> 30:02.711
Is there a
grace period?

30:02.713 --> 30:03.979
Nope.

30:03.981 --> 30:05.914
So he's holding
all the cards.

30:05.916 --> 30:08.317
I'm afraid so.

30:08.319 --> 30:09.952
What about the money?

30:09.954 --> 30:12.254
Andrea said he withholds
money from her.

30:12.256 --> 30:13.589
Can she prove that?

30:13.591 --> 30:16.258
I don't know.
But if she can, can she use it?

30:16.260 --> 30:17.326
She could bring

30:17.328 --> 30:18.293
criminal charges for fraud,

30:18.295 --> 30:20.028
but the outcome
would be the same.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.563
She'd lose her job.

30:21.565 --> 30:22.831
And she'd be sent home.

30:22.833 --> 30:24.299
She could try

30:24.301 --> 30:25.701
to remake Nannygate.

30:25.703 --> 30:26.835
What's that?

30:26.837 --> 30:28.237
Two attorney general candidates

30:28.239 --> 30:29.738
had their careers
go up in flames

30:29.740 --> 30:32.407
for employing
undocumented immigrants.

30:33.310 --> 30:35.244
And his whole act
is helping immigrants.

30:35.246 --> 30:37.379
But it's a long way
from complaining about your boss

30:37.381 --> 30:38.914
to trying to blow him up.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.682
That's a choice
she should be able to make.

30:40.684 --> 30:42.651
Or we give him a sneak peek
of her hand,

30:42.653 --> 30:44.119
see if that gets his attention.

30:45.055 --> 30:47.322
Just remember
who you're up against.

30:47.324 --> 30:49.758
Yeah. All the more reason.

31:03.507 --> 31:05.474
Danny.

31:05.476 --> 31:07.476
Hey.

31:07.478 --> 31:09.411
Thanks for coming in, Shelly.

31:09.413 --> 31:10.949
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

31:10.950 --> 31:11.411
Hi.

31:11.415 --> 31:12.581
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.082
How can I help you, Detectives?

31:14.084 --> 31:17.019
Why don't you, uh,
take a seat, okay?

31:19.490 --> 31:23.158
Uh, you were right about Leah.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.860
And we think that Luke

31:24.862 --> 31:27.062
may have played a part
in this whole thing.

31:27.064 --> 31:28.697
You-you can't be serious.

31:28.699 --> 31:30.198
We were wondering
if you could

31:30.200 --> 31:31.700
give us anything about Luke

31:31.702 --> 31:34.069
that might help us understand
why he would do this.

31:34.071 --> 31:35.437
But he's always been a good kid.

31:35.439 --> 31:36.938
Good kid with his family?

31:36.940 --> 31:39.574
Yeah. I mean, he was at
baseball camp with my son

31:39.576 --> 31:41.576
when Leah was
announced missing,

31:41.578 --> 31:43.879
and he left straightaway
to go help with the search.

31:43.881 --> 31:45.814
Help how?

31:45.816 --> 31:48.083
He practically directed it.
He was walking the fields.

31:48.085 --> 31:50.752
He was showing the authorities
where he'd seen her last.

31:50.754 --> 31:52.754
Luke was the last person
to see her alive?

31:52.756 --> 31:53.789
Yeah.

31:53.791 --> 31:55.590
Okay.

31:55.592 --> 31:56.992
Where was this baseball camp?

31:56.994 --> 31:58.994
Jersey. Just north of
New Brunswick.

31:58.996 --> 32:00.429
Thanks. Do me a favor.

32:00.431 --> 32:02.097
Don't talk to anyone
about this, okay?

32:02.099 --> 32:04.433
Okay.

32:04.435 --> 32:06.101
Will you walk her
out, please? Thanks.

32:06.103 --> 32:08.236
What are you thinking?

32:08.238 --> 32:09.705
What am I thinking?

32:09.707 --> 32:12.341
I'm thinking that Luke
killed his sister 13 years ago,

32:12.343 --> 32:14.276
and led that whole search party

32:14.278 --> 32:16.478
as a diversion away
from where her body was.

32:16.480 --> 32:19.681
But why cover it up now
and risk getting caught?

32:19.683 --> 32:22.017
I have no idea. Maybe he has
a guilty conscience.

32:22.019 --> 32:23.051
I mean, his mother

32:23.053 --> 32:24.753
hasn't let it go
for 13 years.

32:24.755 --> 32:26.488
Maybe somehow he thought
that bringing her back

32:26.490 --> 32:29.091
would put the whole thing to bed
once and for all. I don't know.

32:29.093 --> 32:30.992
We still got nothing
without a body.

32:30.994 --> 32:33.328
I know that.

32:42.573 --> 32:45.173
I'm sorry, but I really don't
have time for this right now.

32:45.175 --> 32:47.175
I think you do,
Congressman.

32:48.979 --> 32:51.179
Excuse us.

32:54.051 --> 32:56.184
We know that you've been
taking advantage of Andrea.

32:56.186 --> 32:58.186
I don't know where you're
getting your information,

32:58.188 --> 33:00.355
but I assure you,
it's misguided.

33:00.357 --> 33:01.957
Oh, really?

33:03.193 --> 33:05.794
These are Andrea's pay stubs
for the last several months.

33:05.796 --> 33:07.195
You've been paying
her a whole lot less

33:07.197 --> 33:08.497
than what she
signed on for.

33:08.499 --> 33:10.031
These don't prove anything.

33:10.033 --> 33:12.033
They prove that you've been
shorting her.

33:12.035 --> 33:13.735
I pay her what I can afford.

33:13.737 --> 33:15.937
And at the same time,
I give her the opportunity

33:15.939 --> 33:17.506
to live in our great country.

33:17.508 --> 33:19.641
What you can afford?
Give me a break.

33:19.643 --> 33:21.376
I don't know
what you think I make,

33:21.378 --> 33:23.178
but believe me,
it's not that much.

33:23.180 --> 33:25.714
Not when you have to have a home
in New York and D.C.

33:25.716 --> 33:27.215
Not with a family to support.

33:27.217 --> 33:29.418
You really believe this isn't
taking advantage of her?

33:29.420 --> 33:30.619
Taking advantage?

33:30.621 --> 33:33.488
I brought Andrea here
on my own personal dollar.

33:33.490 --> 33:35.824
I've given her
every opportunity.

33:35.826 --> 33:38.126
How much of this is about
Andrea, and how much of this

33:38.128 --> 33:40.061
is about leveraging her
for your campaign?

33:40.864 --> 33:42.397
Oh, please.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.399
You're way out
of your league here.

33:46.804 --> 33:48.537
We've talked to the D.A.'s
office about this, Congressman,

33:48.539 --> 33:49.704
and what you're doing
is a crime.

33:49.706 --> 33:51.072
We're talking criminal charges.

33:51.074 --> 33:52.941
You'd be a headline
from coast to coast.

33:52.943 --> 33:56.011
What do you want?

33:56.013 --> 33:57.412
It's not what we want,
it's what Andrea wants,

33:57.414 --> 33:58.713
to be treated with
dignity and respect.

33:58.715 --> 34:01.783
Compared to what?
Her circumstances back home?

34:03.687 --> 34:05.854
You're gonna pay her back wages
and you're gonna pay her

34:05.856 --> 34:07.722
what she's owed from now on,
and you're gonna keep

34:07.724 --> 34:09.157
your promise to bring
her family over.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.692
'Cause when you're elected,

34:10.694 --> 34:12.726
and when you make promises
to someone,

34:12.728 --> 34:15.297
you're making that promise
from all of us.

34:16.934 --> 34:19.634
I hope you two realize
what you're doing here.

34:19.636 --> 34:21.069
We're just
stating the facts.

34:21.071 --> 34:23.538
You're threatening
a U.S. congressman.

34:23.540 --> 34:25.907
Rest assured,
it won't end well for you.

34:36.024 --> 34:38.402
You think I haven't already run
her DNA through CODIS?

34:38.764 --> 34:40.331
No hits, Detectives.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.100
Okay, but did you run
it through each state's

34:42.101 --> 34:43.601
DNA database separately?

34:43.603 --> 34:47.105
If someone found her body, it'd
be in the national database.

34:47.107 --> 34:48.406
No. Not necessarily.

34:48.408 --> 34:50.775
I've already checked, anyway.
There's nothing.

34:50.777 --> 34:52.043
You checked
all 50 states?

34:52.045 --> 34:53.777
Or you just checked New York?

34:53.780 --> 34:56.114
Well, she went missing
in New York.

34:56.116 --> 34:58.149
Did you check New Jersey?

35:18.305 --> 35:19.370
Damn.

35:20.774 --> 35:24.309
Jane Doe.
Body found in 2010.

35:24.311 --> 35:26.110
Ruled a homicide
by strangulation

35:26.112 --> 35:28.613
somewhere between
2003 and 2005.

35:28.615 --> 35:30.515
Piscataway, New Jersey.

35:30.517 --> 35:32.550
That's just north
of New Brunswick,

35:32.552 --> 35:34.118
not far from Luke's
baseball camp.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.587
Son of a bitch must have
taken her body with him

35:36.589 --> 35:37.955
and dumped it out of state.

35:37.957 --> 35:40.425
He knows we arrested Selena.
He'll be on the run.

35:40.427 --> 35:41.592
Let's get ahead of him.

35:56.776 --> 35:59.944
Luke Harris! Police! Open up!

36:05.251 --> 36:06.751
Police!

36:10.690 --> 36:12.457
Luke Harris!

36:13.393 --> 36:15.259
Door.

36:21.234 --> 36:23.201
Luke Harris, police!

36:36.583 --> 36:39.484
Hold it! Hey!

36:39.486 --> 36:40.818
Hold it!

36:45.458 --> 36:47.592
Get off me.
Shut up!

36:47.594 --> 36:49.093
I didn't do anything.

36:49.095 --> 36:50.795
Tell that to your sister.

36:53.767 --> 36:54.999
Get on your feet.

36:55.001 --> 36:56.834
Get up!

36:56.836 --> 36:59.337
You're under arrest
for the murder of Leah Harris.

36:59.339 --> 37:01.472
I didn't mean to do it.

37:01.474 --> 37:03.307
Yeah, I'm sure
you didn't.

37:03.309 --> 37:05.476
Get him the hell
out of here.

37:07.547 --> 37:10.047
Andrea.
What are you doing here?

37:10.049 --> 37:12.750
I came to say good-bye.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.118
Is everything okay?

37:14.120 --> 37:17.288
I know you two spoke
with the congressman,

37:17.290 --> 37:18.723
even after I said not to.

37:18.725 --> 37:20.224
We were trying to help.

37:20.226 --> 37:21.426
What happened?

37:21.428 --> 37:24.128
He's paying me
everything he owes me.

37:24.130 --> 37:25.329
And he has given me

37:25.331 --> 37:28.332
a week off from the campaign
to go visit my family.

37:29.402 --> 37:31.102
That's wonderful.

37:31.104 --> 37:34.038
I'm on my way to the airport.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.873
I-I wanted to say thank you.

37:35.875 --> 37:38.276
Well, glad we could help.

37:38.278 --> 37:40.278
What did you say to him?

37:41.247 --> 37:43.714
You know that poem
on the Statue of Liberty?

37:43.716 --> 37:45.116
"The New Colossus."

37:45.118 --> 37:46.250
I didn't know it had a name.

37:46.252 --> 37:47.718
Well, here in New York,

37:47.720 --> 37:49.887
we kind of think of it
not so much as a poem,

37:49.889 --> 37:51.055
but more of a promise.

37:51.057 --> 37:52.723
We had a little talk
about keeping that promise,

37:52.725 --> 37:54.959
whether you're a congressman
or just a cop.

37:54.961 --> 37:56.828
He seemed to be on board.

37:56.830 --> 37:58.429
Oh.

37:58.431 --> 38:00.264
And if you ever again
feel like you can't

38:00.266 --> 38:01.899
reach your congressman,
you know who to call.

38:01.901 --> 38:03.801
The cops?

38:03.803 --> 38:05.336
These two.

38:07.674 --> 38:10.541
Thank you.

38:19.552 --> 38:22.220
This is not for me to say;
this is for you to say.

38:22.222 --> 38:24.188
I said I'd march with you,
I didn't say I'd speak.

38:24.190 --> 38:25.356
The mayor's remarks are

38:25.358 --> 38:28.226
obviously intended for
the West Indian community,

38:28.228 --> 38:29.827
not your rank and file.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.063
There's hundreds of our
rank and file at this parade.

38:32.065 --> 38:34.365
Who are traditionally
a vital part

38:34.367 --> 38:36.567
of this community
at this parade.

38:36.569 --> 38:37.635
How? They're cops.

38:37.637 --> 38:39.437
Madam Mayor,
have you ever been

38:39.439 --> 38:41.305
to the West Indian Day parade?

38:41.307 --> 38:43.808
- No.
- It's quite a lively event.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.042
It starts early
the night before,

38:45.044 --> 38:48.012
drinking, eating, dancing,
drinking, drinking...

38:48.014 --> 38:49.113
We get it.

38:49.115 --> 38:51.949
And by the time
the parade actually begins,

38:51.951 --> 38:53.718
well, there's kind of a need

38:53.720 --> 38:55.820
for a cool, calm display
of force.

38:55.822 --> 38:57.522
Which you provide,
as is your job.

38:57.524 --> 38:58.990
But given that

38:58.992 --> 39:02.660
this year's event honors a man
who targeted cops with bombs...

39:02.662 --> 39:03.828
For which he served out
his sentence.

39:03.830 --> 39:06.130
But a tip of the hat
to our boys in blue

39:06.132 --> 39:08.533
would be appropriate and wise.

39:09.302 --> 39:10.735
This language is

39:10.737 --> 39:12.336
maybe a little overheated?

39:12.338 --> 39:14.639
A little? Maybe?
He wrote it.

39:19.012 --> 39:22.146
I will not leave my cops
out in the cold.

39:23.683 --> 39:26.083
We're holding up the start.
Shall we?

39:29.789 --> 39:32.957
Whether you know it or not,
or like it or not,

39:32.959 --> 39:35.393
I'm looking out for you, too.

39:36.763 --> 39:40.364
<i>Faut pas pousser meme</i>
<i>dans Les orties.</i>

39:40.366 --> 39:42.934
"Don't push Granny
in the nettles."

39:42.936 --> 39:44.902
Watch the attitude.

39:44.904 --> 39:47.605
Yes, boss.

39:51.945 --> 39:53.978
Shall we?

40:03.222 --> 40:05.756
All I see is vegetables.

40:05.758 --> 40:07.858
Come on, give it a chance, Pop.
Do you need help?

40:07.860 --> 40:09.093
No, I don't.

40:09.095 --> 40:11.495
I guess it's coming.
So is Christmas.

40:11.497 --> 40:13.197
Dinner is served.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.368
Linda's famous Chicken Francaise

40:17.370 --> 40:18.703
Ala Danny.

40:18.705 --> 40:20.237
Wow.

40:20.239 --> 40:22.073
At least they're not
extra crispy.

40:22.075 --> 40:22.974
Looks great, Dad.

40:22.976 --> 40:24.308
Thank you.

40:24.310 --> 40:26.644
There's a whole oven full,
so don't be shy.

40:26.646 --> 40:28.913
What's with the bandage?
You want me to sign it?

40:28.915 --> 40:30.948
Looks worse than it is.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.350
He probably told 'em
to dress it up.

40:32.352 --> 40:35.553
I did not.
So it's just a little boo-boo?

40:36.489 --> 40:38.155
You guys, he had
a beer bottle thrown at him.

40:38.157 --> 40:39.323
Have some respect.

40:39.325 --> 40:40.658
Well, at least the woman
had the courtesy

40:40.660 --> 40:43.060
to drink the beer
before she threw the bottle.

40:43.062 --> 40:44.261
What, are you turning
the other cheek?

40:44.263 --> 40:46.364
No.
Kinda.

40:46.366 --> 40:47.431
Yeah, Dad, it's kind of seeming
like you're going

40:47.433 --> 40:48.432
a little Switzerland on us.

40:48.434 --> 40:49.467
Switzerland?

40:49.469 --> 40:50.368
It's neutral.

40:50.370 --> 40:52.937
So, is this a new you?
No.

40:52.939 --> 40:55.740
Good, 'cause I was just
getting used to the old you.

40:57.243 --> 40:58.943
I, for one, commend your father.

40:58.945 --> 41:00.845
You do? For what?

41:00.847 --> 41:02.480
Well, for being the PC

41:02.482 --> 41:04.815
and putting himself
in harm's way...

41:05.785 --> 41:06.984
...like a street cop.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.253
Well, I wouldn't
exactly say...

41:09.255 --> 41:12.156
Oh, you ever volunteer for duty
on the West Indian Day parade?

41:12.158 --> 41:13.357
No.

41:13.359 --> 41:15.192
Huh. Danny?

41:15.194 --> 41:18.162
Well, I didn't put in,
but I was...

41:18.164 --> 41:19.430
Because you knew
it was dangerous,

41:19.432 --> 41:20.564
as did your father.

41:20.566 --> 41:21.666
But he did his duty,

41:21.668 --> 41:23.234
and he marched.

41:23.236 --> 41:24.869
It's complicated.

41:24.871 --> 41:27.004
Because of the guy
who they honored?

41:27.006 --> 41:28.572
You didn't take sides?

41:28.574 --> 41:31.175
I did take sides, both--

41:31.177 --> 41:33.210
my cops
and the people we serve.

41:33.212 --> 41:35.546
