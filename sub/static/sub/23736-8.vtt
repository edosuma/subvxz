09:45.953 --> 09:48.386
- Awwww man.
Locked in a room.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.823
This "office therapy"
stuff is stupid.

09:51.825 --> 09:56.127
- N-n-noooo,
it's a fun game.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.896
- It's called
"Escape The Room"

09:57.898 --> 09:59.497
and we all have to
look around for clues.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.933
And see, the clues'll
help us find a key

10:01.935 --> 10:05.537
that'll open one of the doors,
and then we can escape.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.538
- Okaaay,

10:06.540 --> 10:10.041
then I guess let's all start
lookin' around for clues.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.811
- Clues.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.088
- Hey, if anyone's
hungry, we got a giant

10:23.090 --> 10:24.255
fortune cookie here.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.391
- I'm not hungry.
- No thanks.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.058
- Wait!

10:27.060 --> 10:30.161
Maybe there's a clue
inside the fortune cookie.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
- Y'y'y'yeah!
- Oooo, open it and check.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.399
- Smash it, smash it.
- Uh, okay...

10:34.401 --> 10:37.002
- Yeah, go for it.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.570

10:38.572 --> 10:41.139
- Read it!
- Read it!

10:42.075 --> 10:43.341
- Okay, it says,

10:43.343 --> 10:45.343
"Being trapped in this room,

10:45.345 --> 10:47.045
"could make you insane.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.417
Better get in my brain."

10:53.387 --> 10:54.185
- In his brain?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.121
But Snoop's not even here.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.188
- Yeah, and even if he was,

10:57.190 --> 11:00.058
how are we supposed to get
inside the man's brain?

11:00.060 --> 11:03.094
- I bet my dad could get
into Snoop's brain.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.362
He's a brain surgeon.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.899
- No hun, your dad's a dentist.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.601
- Heyyyyyy.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.370
Why am I talkin'?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.239
- Okay c'mon,
we need to think here.

11:14.241 --> 11:18.009
How do we get
in Snoop's brain...

all this stuff you broke!

12:21.174 --> 12:23.041
- Do you know how much
that's gonna cost?!?

12:23.043 --> 12:27.579
- Well, my guess
would be about $6,000.

other's feelings.

19:17.023 --> 19:17.955
- What? No, no...

19:17.957 --> 19:20.958
Stop giggling right now.
This is not funny.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.828
- I, I can't help it!

19:25.865 --> 19:28.399
- Ohhhhhh, it was you!

19:28.401 --> 19:30.067
You little rascal!

19:30.069 --> 19:32.670
- Open this door, somebody!
Come on!

19:32.672 --> 19:36.908
Lemme outta Doctor Snoop Dogg's
prison of insanity!

19:36.910 --> 19:39.477
[ computer beeping ]

19:39.479 --> 19:42.079
- Exit denied.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.582
- What are "eggs of the night?"

19:44.584 --> 19:46.651
- "Exit denied."

19:46.653 --> 19:50.087
- Uh you guys, that's
an automatic retinal scanner.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.923
- Uh, huh?
- What'd ya say?

19:51.925 --> 19:53.758
- Automatic retinal scanner.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.861
Kenzie: Yeah, I think
Hudson's right!

19:56.863 --> 19:59.497
- Y-you do?!?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.098
- Well, if the door shined
a light on his face,

20:01.100 --> 20:03.134
and it scanned
his eyes, then yeah!

20:03.136 --> 20:04.569
That's a retinal scanner!

20:04.571 --> 20:06.571
- Well what does that mean?!?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.672
- That it scans your face,

20:07.674 --> 20:11.108
and if it recognizes your eye,
then the door unlocks.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.843
- Oh, okay.
- That makes sense.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.712
- Thanks ghost Kenzie!

20:14.714 --> 20:15.780
- Okay, the question is,

20:15.782 --> 20:18.182
who's got the eye
that'll unlock the door?!?

20:18.184 --> 20:19.183
- Uhhh, umm, ooo...ooo!

20:19.185 --> 20:22.053
Snoop's last clue!
Yes, yes...

20:22.055 --> 20:24.989
Something something surprise,

20:24.991 --> 20:26.691
your freedom lies,

20:26.693 --> 20:28.626
in the lizard's eyes!!!

20:28.628 --> 20:29.694
- Yeah! Hudson!

20:29.696 --> 20:30.928
Take that lizard
over to the door

20:30.930 --> 20:34.232
and put him in front
a'that rectal scanner!

20:34.234 --> 20:35.633
Kenzie: It's retinal!

20:35.635 --> 20:36.701
- Oh, same thing!

20:36.703 --> 20:39.670
Kenzie: Yeah, not really.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.806
Computer: Unlock.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.742
- It worked!
- Yeah, bye!

20:47.580 --> 20:48.879
- Congratulations,
Game Shakers.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.682
You all worked together,
to solve a problem,

20:51.684 --> 20:52.783
and you succeeded.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.486
- Well, yeah, yeah,
I guess we did.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.189
- Ya see? It's all
about teamwork,

20:58.191 --> 21:02.159
respect,
and sometimes lizards.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.029
- Okaaaay.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.999
- Now, I'm gonna send you
a bill for this session.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.001
And it's gonna be expensive.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.036
- Great.

21:12.038 --> 21:12.803
- By the way,

21:12.805 --> 21:15.773
as a present from me,
keep the lizard.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.108
- Oh...

21:17.110 --> 21:20.177
- And remember the most
important thing of all.

21:22.048 --> 21:22.880
- Which is...?

21:22.882 --> 21:26.684
- Send that money. Peace.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.219
- Bye Doctor Snoop!

21:28.221 --> 21:30.554
- Yeah bye.

21:30.556 --> 21:31.322
- C'mon Lazardio.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.825
- You named the lizard
Lazardio?

21:34.827 --> 21:35.826
- Yeah, heyyyy!

21:35.828 --> 21:37.261
You wanna take him
up to the roof

21:37.263 --> 21:38.696
and watch him fly?

21:38.698 --> 21:40.564
- No. Lizards don't fly.

21:40.566 --> 21:43.567
- They do 'till they
hit the ground.

21:43.903 --> 21:48.739
- Oh Hudson.
Wait no, don't do it.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.208
Kenzie: [ echoing ]
Are we leaving now?

21:51.210 --> 21:55.613
Babe?
Are you guys looking for me?

21:55.615 --> 21:59.750
Doctor Snoop?
Lazardio...?
