long time ago.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.852
Seven winters
after the Battle of Svolder.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.768

across the land

shelter...

07:54.169 --> 07:57.607

was probably not great idea.

struck by lightning.

I mean, him.

at you with your own bone.

Every Viking boy,
from very little,

08:11.665 --> 08:13.623

08:13.667 --> 08:16.496
and having a most triumphant
Viking funeral.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.498
It is a very special day.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.632
But Thor... never have one.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.155
He wants a Viking funeral.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.593

like we shoot a flaming arrow

08:26.636 --> 08:27.985
and burn the bones
in a boat?

08:28.029 --> 08:30.858
Yes! Yes! Small man knows.

08:30.901 --> 08:31.772
Yep.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.991
That does sound kind of cool.

were actually Viking,

09:18.296 --> 09:19.907

are genuine, they'll buy them.

Look, I know he's a ghost.
But if we don't help him,

15:56.216 --> 15:58.653
aren't we the real monsters?

15:58.696 --> 16:00.394
Babe, that was so poetic.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.831
I know, right?
[chuckles]Oh, my-- Mmm.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.920
Oh... All right.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.922
Fine. Fine. Funeral's back on.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.445
Hey, Thor, buddy.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.620
Funeral's back on.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.057
Oh, no, he left the room.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.623
Okay. This is getting
really confusing.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.973
We got to work on this. Thor!

16:14.016 --> 16:16.018
Thor!Thor! The funeral's on!

16:16.062 --> 16:17.019
THORFINN:
Yes!

16:17.063 --> 16:18.978
By the fangs of Fenrir,

16:19.021 --> 16:20.066
I thank you.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.981
[laughs, grunts]Is he happy?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.939
Yay!
[laughs]

16:23.983 --> 16:25.288
Oh, so about that curse...

16:25.332 --> 16:26.898
Can't be undone.
[chuckles]

16:26.942 --> 16:28.204
Sorry.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.597
What curse?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.600
HETTY:
It gives me great pleasure

16:32.643 --> 16:35.298
to cast the
deciding vote for...

16:35.342 --> 16:36.343
Alberta!

16:37.648 --> 16:39.607
Who made me realize
that women should vote.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.826
Although I'm still against
them going to college.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.220
Baby steps. Isaac,

16:44.264 --> 16:45.656
you ran a
good campaign.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.136
Just not as good as mine.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.399
Point of order: I believe

16:49.443 --> 16:52.663
not all the votes
have been counted.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.839
Oh, God.You may have thought

16:54.883 --> 16:56.798
your upstairs votes
were all that mattered.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.278
But true democracy

16:58.321 --> 17:00.367
leaves
no one behind.[gagging]

17:00.410 --> 17:02.151
And they stand with me.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.805
But not too close.
Not too close.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.894
Well, this seems
a little underhanded.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.983
Let the coronation proceed.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.637
Ooh. Yeah.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.074
We're all voting
for Creepy Dirk.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.206
[gasps]

17:13.249 --> 17:14.859
[stammers]

17:14.903 --> 17:16.557
But that would make him
the winner.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.298
DIRK:So, uh,

17:18.341 --> 17:21.910
when do I get to talk
to the lady that smells good?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.434
Yeah, democracy
is broken.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.915
It's a flawed
system, everyone.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.222
All right. Now, remember,
just like we talked about.Ooh!

17:29.265 --> 17:30.571
Keep your
back straight.Keep your back straight.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.355
Mm-hmm.Now pull back
slowly but evenly

17:32.399 --> 17:33.400
with the first...Now pull back...

17:33.443 --> 17:34.879
I would take
Pete's advice on this

17:34.923 --> 17:36.446
with a grain of salt.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.405
...of your index
and middle fingers.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.626
[cheering]

17:43.671 --> 17:45.803
[Thorfinn laughs]Bravo, bravo.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.979
Thor wants to thank
Samantha and small man

17:48.023 --> 17:50.373
for making
special day possible.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.419
Though I wish
you would have secured mead.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.203
But we'll let that go.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.857
You're welcome, Thor.Mm-hmm.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.207
[chuckles]

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
Sometimes you meet a bro

17:59.948 --> 18:01.732
and you're like,
"This is a bro..."

18:01.776 --> 18:03.212
I just wanted to say that,

18:03.256 --> 18:05.388
even though neither of us
won the election,

18:05.432 --> 18:06.694
you have won my respect.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.217
Where is this going?

18:08.261 --> 18:09.740
I resorted to
dirty tricks,

18:09.784 --> 18:11.916
and you, you
inspired people.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.918
That's the mark of a
truly talented politician.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.878
Well, you know, I do have
that star quality. [chuckles]

18:16.921 --> 18:18.923
Oh, I didn't mean to imply
that you don't.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.838
No, it's a fair
critique. [sighs]

18:20.882 --> 18:22.405
I was never the type
the commoners liked

18:22.449 --> 18:24.103
to have an ale
with. [scoffs]

18:24.146 --> 18:26.235
Those dirty, filthy,
ignorant commoners.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.932
Hard to see why
they didn't like you.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.848
Agreed. It's a
mystery. [inhales]

18:30.892 --> 18:33.329
Now is typically time
when we have orgy. But...

18:33.373 --> 18:35.462
orgy without mead is...

18:35.505 --> 18:36.724
very awkward.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.901
♪

18:39.944 --> 18:41.555
Oh! It's happening!

18:41.598 --> 18:43.992
He is getting sucked off![gasps]

18:44.035 --> 18:46.864
By the eye of the All-father!

18:46.908 --> 18:48.301
Valhalla!

18:48.344 --> 18:49.302
Wait!

18:49.345 --> 18:51.217
[exhales]

18:51.260 --> 18:52.479
Thorfinn, I love you.

18:52.522 --> 18:53.958
Oh.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.308
I've always loved you.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.266
Why you wait till now
to say this?

18:57.310 --> 18:58.833
So many years wasted!

18:58.876 --> 19:00.226
[bullhorn tone sounds]

19:00.269 --> 19:02.967
Please extinguish the fire
in the middle of the pond!

19:03.011 --> 19:04.665
You do not have a permit.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.147
Sorry!Yeah, I'll take care of it
right now! Thank you!

19:08.190 --> 19:09.887
Uh...

19:12.107 --> 19:15.502
So, now seems like
we have second chance.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.635
You know, I think I kind of
got caught up in the moment.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.376
Yeah. Just...
[chuckles]

19:20.420 --> 19:22.204
And I-I don't really
want to be tied down.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
Moving on! [laughs][chuckles]: Yeah.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.121
Not in love.Cool, cool.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.037
Thank you for doing all this.
It really meant a lot to him.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.345
I'm glad. And, um, don't worry
about the house and everything.

19:32.388 --> 19:36.044
We got a lot to fix up,
but we'll figure it out.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.480
Custom booth
would've been nice.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.482
It would've been
a game changer.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.311
But I got to say,
watching my man fire that arrow,

19:42.355 --> 19:43.660
pretty hot.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.358
[chuckles]Indeed.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.402
The fire.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.012
The fire is what's hot.
[inhales]

19:48.056 --> 19:50.798
As fire is.
And no one can argue with that.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.452
So...

19:52.495 --> 19:54.280
How are you, big guy?

19:54.323 --> 19:56.151
I am happy.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.762
It was not time for Thor
to be sucked off.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.505
Shipmates may have abandoned
Thor, but...

20:02.549 --> 20:04.507
you did not.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.379
And that goes
for all of you!

20:06.422 --> 20:09.033
You have
never abandoned me.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.339
And for that,

20:10.383 --> 20:12.254
I am thankful!

20:12.298 --> 20:14.430
Thank you.How could we abandon him?

20:14.474 --> 20:15.692
We literally
can't leave.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.738
Shh. Just let him
have this.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.130
Okay.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.436
We would never leave you.Rejoice!

20:20.480 --> 20:22.482
[excited chatter]♪

20:29.140 --> 20:30.272
So we'll meet down here
once a week to

20:30.316 --> 20:33.275
go over the
ghost requests.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.581
Uh-huh.First request--

20:34.624 --> 20:36.017
this comes
from Stuart--

20:36.060 --> 20:38.933
do you mind if
he smells you?

20:38.976 --> 20:40.543
[sniffing]Nope, not doing
this. Sorry, guys.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.241

Aw...
