then they disappear
in the chaos

04:13.601 --> 04:15.516
right in the middle
of the street.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.041
Yeah, but the only problem
with that

04:19.084 --> 04:20.434
is that somebody would have
noticed

04:20.477 --> 04:22.740
him walking through Midtown
with a sniper's rifle.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.873

a concealed sniper rifle.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.266
Collapsible.
Fits in a briefcase

04:26.309 --> 04:28.050
or a backpack.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.747
This guy had a plan.

04:33.751 --> 04:37.059
- Roland Poe was a rising star
at the U.S. Attorney's office,

04:37.102 --> 04:38.495
and he got there

04:38.539 --> 04:41.019
by putting bad guys
with white collars behind bars.

04:41.063 --> 04:43.283
So we're talking
tax and security fraud,

04:43.326 --> 04:45.285
money laundering,
real estate fraud,

04:45.328 --> 04:48.462
corporate big shots,
scum bags mostly.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.464
- We're looking
at every case Poe prosecuted,

04:50.507 --> 04:53.815
prioritizing defendants
awaiting indictment.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.122
- You really think someone's
gonna kill over tax returns?

04:57.166 --> 05:00.082
- People have killed over less.
Guy put people behind bars.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.344
- People have killed over less.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.259
Sometimes they're
just angry or deranged,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.826
but there's always a trigger.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.045
- Well, we're also looking
at the other two victims.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.264
Any red flags on their lives,

05:08.308 --> 05:09.744
any connection
to Poe or each other.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.441
- Well, shooting was
in a public space

05:11.485 --> 05:13.617
so any connection
to the victims feels tenuous.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.011
This had a-an element
of spectacle to it.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.622
- So you're saying they're
just trying to create a scene?

05:18.666 --> 05:19.667
Cause a panic?

05:19.710 --> 05:20.972
- Sure, to scare people.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.323
Morning rush hour,
middle of a public square.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.585
- Well, mission accomplished.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.935
NYPD already closed
all access to parks,

05:26.978 --> 05:29.372
public areas,
playgrounds.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.939
- Killing from a distance
is an attempt

05:30.982 --> 05:32.897
to demonstrate
or reassert power,

05:32.941 --> 05:35.944
so our sniper most likely
experienced a recent setback

05:35.987 --> 05:37.946
or a personal loss.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.296
- Are you looking into all of
the business in the building?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.950
Anybody recently terminated?

05:41.993 --> 05:44.213
- Anyone who made threats,
had anger management issues?

05:44.256 --> 05:47.608
We're on it.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.305
- Do you have the ballistics
report yet?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.655
- Yeah, the coroner's rushing
the autopsy

05:51.699 --> 05:53.570
to retrieve the bullets,
but Ballistics

05:53.614 --> 05:56.138
is on the fragment ERT
recovered from the street.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.966
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.620
- Let's talk to Sammy.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.753
Sammy.

06:02.797 --> 06:03.928
Give us the good news.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.453
- I prefer to give you
the bad news first.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.629
- There's meds for that, Sammy.
- Very funny.

06:08.672 --> 06:12.459
So the fragment ERT found
is too small to ID a caliber.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.201
- No caliber, no ammo type.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.725
Tough to zero in
on purchasers, sellers.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.815
- So I used digital
reconstruction software

06:20.858 --> 06:22.686
to build on the fragment,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.645
allowing me
to cross reference it

06:24.688 --> 06:27.691
with the National Integrated
Ballistics database.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.173
- Crimp marks--

06:31.216 --> 06:32.479
- From a seating die

06:32.522 --> 06:34.045
clamping the bullet
inside a shell casing.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.351
- Part of the process

06:35.395 --> 06:36.831
of packing custom
loads of ammunition.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.137
- So the marksman
can adjust the weight and power

06:39.181 --> 06:40.922
of their bullets.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.793
- Your turn.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.756
- 6.5 millimeter Grendel.

06:48.799 --> 06:52.194
Similar to popular hunting
calibers like .308.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.935
- But a 6.5 millimeter Grendel

06:53.978 --> 06:55.850
is lighter, cheaper,
and has lower recoil.

06:55.893 --> 07:00.420
- So a sniper can shoot faster,
longer, and buy more bullets.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.160
- This isn't making me
feel better.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.510
- Can a 6.5 Grendel
be chambered

07:03.553 --> 07:05.120
with a concealable
sniper rifle?

07:05.163 --> 07:07.383
- It can be chambered with
any number of weapon platforms,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.254
and it can be broken down,
carried and concealed

07:09.298 --> 07:12.257
in something as small as
a tennis racket case.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.087
- We're looking for stores
that sold 6.5 Grendel ammo

07:16.131 --> 07:17.654
within the last month.

07:17.698 --> 07:20.788
- Looks AUSA Poe maybe have
been up to something sketchy.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.354
His office said he had
a doctor's appointment

07:22.398 --> 07:23.965
at the time he was shot,

07:24.008 --> 07:26.533
only the calendar in his cell
had a meeting with an attorney.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.665
- Who's office is
in 101 Park Ave?

07:28.709 --> 07:29.579
- Unfortunately.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.624
- Nothing sketchy about it.

07:30.667 --> 07:31.842
Defense lawyers are famous

07:31.886 --> 07:33.235
for spur of
the moment meetings.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.063
- Mr. Parnow is
a divorce lawyer.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.499
Gets better.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.718
Poe charged two plane tickets

07:37.761 --> 07:40.242
to Turks and Caicos.
Leaving this Sunday.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.244
- Much needed vacation
with the wife?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.289
- I was hoping,
but as far as I can tell,

07:44.333 --> 07:46.378
Mrs. Poe's passport
expired last year.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.511
State has no record
of renewal application.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.296
- There are private services
that provide 24-hour renewal.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.907
- Well, you're certainly
an optimist.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.996
- Growing up Muslim in New York
after 9/11?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.954
You kind of have to be.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.304
- What do you think
military trained hitmen

07:59.348 --> 08:00.305
go for these days?

08:00.349 --> 08:01.481
- Sounds like an affair.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.439
Talk to Mrs. Poe.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.440
And were gonna need
the name of every

08:04.484 --> 08:05.746
retired military marksmen

08:05.789 --> 08:08.009
living in the tri-state area.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.014
- How do you want
to handle this?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.150
- Little widow-to-widow
bonding?

08:19.194 --> 08:21.022
- Could help her open up.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.242
- She may be grieving,
but she's still a suspect.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.244
- Yeah, this one's a tightrope.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.333
- Yeah.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.470
- Melanie and Michelle.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.559
They're in my bedroom
with my sister.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.736
I was on phone with him when...

08:40.694 --> 08:42.739
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Poe.

08:42.783 --> 08:46.526
- I didn't how to tell them...
what words.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.529
Rollie could have gone
to Wall Street, you know,

08:49.572 --> 08:51.052
but he was a crusader.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.967
- Sounds like you didn't really
care for his choice.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.534
- I don't think I had
a good night's sleep

08:54.577 --> 08:57.058
until he transferred
into financial crimes.

08:58.189 --> 09:01.323
"Thank God," I thought.
At least no one will be...

09:01.366 --> 09:03.368
shooting at him.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.327
Silly me.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.634
- Did he ever mention
any threats?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.679
- Do you want to hear
about bad timing?

09:10.680 --> 09:13.335
He actually decided
to leave that damn job.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.817
- He was supposed
to interview at...

09:16.860 --> 09:20.255
University of Texas, USC,
and a bunch of others.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.736
Six law schools in two weeks.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.389
- Teaching would have
given him more time

09:24.433 --> 09:26.217
with you and the girls.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.002
- It's all I ever wanted.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.439
- Sounds like he worked
a lot of hours.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.007
Nights and weekends?

09:34.617 --> 09:37.011
- It might.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.404
- Yeah he was at the office
all the time.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.450
- You'd call him,
check up on him?

09:43.757 --> 09:46.411
- I was married to a prosecutor
for 15 years.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.630
I know what you're doing.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.240
You're treating me like
a suspect.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.328
Do you think I had
my husband killed?

09:50.372 --> 09:51.808
- Nobody said that.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.854
- I need you to tell me
what you think happened here.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.116
What?

09:56.421 --> 09:59.033
What do you know?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.251
Say something!

10:02.079 --> 10:03.907
- Sorry, excuse me.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.610
- OA.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.917
There's been another shooting.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.909

the shared guilt

17:27.089 --> 17:29.135

It was her apartment.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.600
Her parents had to co-sign

18:14.223 --> 18:15.920

18:15.964 --> 18:17.487

18:55.569 --> 18:58.180
before he was evicted.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.878

came to that.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.706
We appreciate Cole.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.186
The man dedicated his life

19:04.230 --> 19:05.970

Was that the other building

19:17.721 --> 19:19.462

19:19.506 --> 19:22.161
I know they had tried

19:22.204 --> 19:25.381

19:26.861 --> 19:28.558

19:28.602 --> 19:30.256

a few times.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.909
- And then he stopped
answering his phone.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.563
- And then the phone went dead.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.217
- He was so depressed.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.697
- A war hero

19:36.740 --> 19:38.916
and he was selling candy
and cigarettes

19:38.960 --> 19:41.658

19:41.702 --> 19:44.095

19:47.969 --> 19:49.449
They fired him.

Jubal, hey.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.240
