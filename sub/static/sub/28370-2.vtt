The best thing you can do
right now: think good thoughts.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.468
With all due respect,
my friend is dead.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.819
So all of my thoughts are
pretty much bad right now.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.517
We don't know that.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.040
Whatever.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.476
Thanks.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.653
Hey, Murphy, uh, Chloe is here.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.698
She wants to say hi.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.486
[quietly]:
Sure.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.401
One second.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.621
[quietly]:
Oh, my God.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.927
[grunts]

09:42.625 --> 09:44.932
[sighs] Do you like
hanging out here?

09:44.975 --> 09:46.498
No.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.066
But my dad thinks
I can't handle being alone.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.591
Oh, my God.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.071
He needs to loosen up.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.596
Dude needs to get laid
or something. [scoffs]

09:57.379 --> 09:58.728
What?

10:02.036 --> 10:03.994
Oh, um...

10:04.038 --> 10:06.736
It means dating.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.173
Like, your dad needs
to go on a date.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.741
[chuckles]

10:11.785 --> 10:13.264
[mouths]

10:18.052 --> 10:19.357
Oh, here she is, here she is.Oh.

10:19.401 --> 10:20.358
Murph?
Thank God.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.577
Your dad right here.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.970
HANK: Hey, good morning.JOY: Good morning!

10:23.013 --> 10:24.972
JOY:
Put your seat belt on.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.630
[groans]

10:30.673 --> 10:32.240
[exhales]

10:32.283 --> 10:34.416
Mom, can you drive faster?
I really have to pee,

10:34.459 --> 10:35.939
like, really bad.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.550
Your mom is driving
the speed limit, sweetheart.

10:38.594 --> 10:41.684
Maybe stop drinking that juice
if you have to urinate, honey.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.947
Exciting things happening
around Guiding Hope tomorrow.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.688
We're having a "barkery."

10:45.732 --> 10:48.430
It's a bakery,
but with dog trainers.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.388
Yeah, I got the pun.[chuckles]

10:50.432 --> 10:53.261
We just need you to
show up and smile.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.741
Well, I can show up.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.265
Murphy, this is
a big deal.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.832
Channel 37 is
covering it.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.616
Oh, Channel 37.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.965
They're doing a whole piece

11:02.009 --> 11:03.401
on how we opened
Guiding Hope for you.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.707
But you opened it up for you.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.579
No, sweetheart,
we opened it up for you.

11:07.623 --> 11:08.711
Well, I'm not going
on television.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.279
Oh, yes, you are.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.455
We're hoping that it would
bring some donations.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.370
Which we desperately need.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.459
Look, we know
you're still upset

11:17.502 --> 11:20.549
about Tyson, but I'm hopeful.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.116
I think he's gonna turn up.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.508
Oh, you have hope, Mom?I do.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.467
Having hope is ridiculous.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.469
The only thing that matters
is actually doing something.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.470
But there's nothing you can do.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.167
That's not true.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.560
I'm gonna figure out
who killed him.

11:31.603 --> 11:34.084
What?!Yeah, what?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.738
I'm gonna figure out
who killed Tyson.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.480
Because I owe him that.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.308
Murphy, that's very noble,

11:40.351 --> 11:41.962
what you're doing,
it is.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.485
Maybe you should just
let the cops handle it.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.747
They're not doing anything.So?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.618
You have no idea
what you're doing,

11:46.662 --> 11:48.751
and it is very dangerous.

11:48.795 --> 11:52.320
Look, just focus on the barkery.

11:54.757 --> 11:55.845
[dogs barking]

11:55.889 --> 11:56.933
MURPHY:
Jess?
Hey.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.762
Ah, Jess!Yeah.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.156
[groans, sighs]

12:02.199 --> 12:03.766
Fix me.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.160
You're a doctor.I'm a veterinarian.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.250
[groaning]:
Well, do something... please.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.828
UTI, the sinner's campfire.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.307
Could you live
without the penis?

12:23.351 --> 12:25.875
I never want to be
near one again.No, I'm serious.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.834
Could you?How long are we talking?

12:27.877 --> 12:30.184
Long. Yeah, like,
a really long time.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.663
[scoffs]
Of course not.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.013
Why are you asking me
stupid questions?

12:33.056 --> 12:34.797
Because Vanessa asked me
if I miss the penis,

12:34.841 --> 12:36.625
and it sounds like
she misses the penis.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.105
Well, stop calling it
"the penis."

12:38.148 --> 12:40.890
Murphy, I'm freaking out.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.241
Wh-What if I'm just,
like, a phase for her?

12:44.285 --> 12:45.765
You said she's really hot,
so just

12:45.808 --> 12:47.201
have a bunch of sex with her
and move on.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.813
Well, I can't do
that, because...

12:50.857 --> 12:53.337
[sighs] I think I'm
in love with her.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.734
Well, I came by to discuss

12:58.778 --> 13:00.780
balloon duty
for tomorrow's event,

13:00.823 --> 13:03.478
but obviously you guys
are very busy.

13:03.521 --> 13:07.003
Uh, I'm so sorry,
could you repeat yourself?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.744
I know what
you're doing, Murphy.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.832
You're trying to
figure out where I am

13:09.876 --> 13:12.530
by my voice
so you can throw...

13:12.574 --> 13:14.750
[sighs]
You've never hit me once.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.578
[exhales sharply]

13:16.621 --> 13:18.232
Okay, so it looks like
you're coming in

13:18.275 --> 13:20.887
at about a rottweiler
and two Chihuahuas.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.411
You need one pill
every 12 hours.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.934
I can mix it
in your food.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.589
Can you drive me to
a burger truck at lunch?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.895
Uh, no, I can't.
I told your mom

13:28.938 --> 13:30.418
I'd help her make cookies
for tomorrow.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.333
Why do you need to go
to a food truck?

13:32.376 --> 13:34.814
Because I need to find Darnell
to see if he'll give me

13:34.857 --> 13:36.772
Tyson's mom's address.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.122
Tyson said he used to go there,
like, every day for lunch.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.430
Right, so, okay, if Darnell
isn't even talking to you,

13:42.473 --> 13:44.911
what makes you think that he's
gonna tell you where she lives?

13:44.954 --> 13:47.827
I know it's nuts,
but it's my only option.

13:47.870 --> 13:48.828
Beggars can't be choosers.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.177
And there's a long history

13:50.220 --> 13:52.092
of blind beggars,
so here we are.

13:53.658 --> 13:54.877
[exhales sharply]

13:54.921 --> 13:56.966
[door squeaking]

14:00.927 --> 14:02.058
Hey.
Hey.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.541
Can you not do that?I'm just trying to help.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.890
I don't need your help.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.899
Very funny, Murphy.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.596
[sighs]

14:18.640 --> 14:20.381
Look, we need to talk
about attire for tomorrow.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.339
What were you
planning on wearing?

14:22.383 --> 14:25.168
The same thing
I wear every day.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.953
I'd like you to wear a dress.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.826
[sighs]I haven't seen your knees
since you were ten.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.915
Would it kill you to look
a little nice for once?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
I'm blind. I don't
think anyone's gonna be

14:34.961 --> 14:36.745
judging my appearance...

14:36.788 --> 14:38.529
besides just you.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.271
And about this Tyson thing,

14:41.315 --> 14:43.186
I'm sorry he went missing.
I wish he hadn't.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.840
Really?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.755
'Cause you hated
that I hung out with him.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.323
You hated it.
So just admit it.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.151
I think this is
a giant relief for you.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.935
That is unfair.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.763
Murphy, I worried about
you down in that alley.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.852
Guess I wasn't the one
you needed to worry about.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.767
I'm your mother.
Sort of my job.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.290
Yeah, and you'd think,
as my mother,

15:00.334 --> 15:02.902
that you'd care about
the kid who saved my life.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.045
[beeping]

15:20.006 --> 15:21.964
[sniffles]

15:37.675 --> 15:39.242
Give me your hand.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.157
What?

15:49.122 --> 15:50.514
What is this?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.258
A bird?

15:55.302 --> 15:56.999
Pterodactyl.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.915
How'd you do that?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.265
Well, it's actually
pretty easy.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.050
I can show you.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.879
You must grasp
the blank canvas.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.185
The first step,

16:09.229 --> 16:11.231
folding it in half.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.841
You can feel the corners

16:12.884 --> 16:14.060
line up?
Yeah.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.019
Pinch right here.Mm-hmm.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.325
Okay.All right, now you take...

16:18.368 --> 16:19.804
[Murphy laughs]

16:19.848 --> 16:21.110
TYSON:
We pull it

16:21.154 --> 16:22.155
as far as we can.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.983
BOTH:
Wings.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.549
Body. And then up here...

16:25.593 --> 16:26.986
MURPHY:
Little body. Okay.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.770
...is the last step.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.947
And now you're-you're done.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.384
Yeah.You did it.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.386
The student has become

16:36.430 --> 16:38.606
the master.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.044
Thank you.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.090
It's my pleasure.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.923
[indistinct chatter]

16:54.274 --> 16:56.232
You should start
a dating profile.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.886
I'm sorry?

16:57.929 --> 16:59.931
Apparently, everyone
meets online now.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.629
It's how the world works.[chuckling]: Oh.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.066
And it's not like you
ever go anywhere.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.589
I go places.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.982
Like, I'm about
to go to Dispatch

17:07.026 --> 17:08.679
and check a bunch
of stuff out.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.725
Might even hit the
water fountain on the way back.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.161
My life is crazy.Dad.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.467
You got a book?

17:13.510 --> 17:15.121
I'll be back
in three chapters

17:15.164 --> 17:17.123
of Mockingjay,and then
we can grab some food.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.428
Okay? Anywhere you want.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.138
Where you going,
sweetie?

17:32.181 --> 17:33.617
I'm trying to find
the bathroom.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
I'll show you the way.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.143
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.709
Thanks.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.538
Do you come here much?

17:41.582 --> 17:44.150
Yeah.
A little too much.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.031
That's a Hinoki
cutting board, man.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.338
Keep the dirty money off it.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.731
You got Eater's Choice
Best Burgers

18:00.775 --> 18:04.213
because of dirty money,
so settle.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.128
Wow, wow.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.695
Well, I like to pretend

18:07.738 --> 18:09.131
I bought this truck myself

18:09.175 --> 18:10.828
and don't have to integrate
illegitimate funds

18:10.872 --> 18:12.178
to brine my own chuck roast.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.702
But it's nice of you to
note my accomplishments.

18:14.745 --> 18:18.662
Man, you hipsters
are exhausting.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.187
All old-timey.
"Brine."

18:21.230 --> 18:24.190
Acting like you invented toast.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.974
The books are clean.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.062
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.456
Seriously, come on.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.284
Let me make you a burger.[sighs]

18:31.327 --> 18:32.285
It's savage.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.983
Savage? Don't.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.160
Come on.
Fine.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.770
Okay, okay.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.253
What do you think?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.690
Okay. Yeah.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.127
MURPHY:
Darnell?

18:49.302 --> 18:50.912
Oh, great.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.696
Yo, ignore that girl.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.351
I'd rather not.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.570
DARNELL:
I'm not here, seriously.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.876
She's crazy annoying.[cell phone chimes]

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
Call Darnell.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.618
[phone ringing]Darnell?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.231
I hear your phone.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.623
[mouthing]

19:08.451 --> 19:11.193
Darnell, I know you're here.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.674
Reveal yourself!

19:13.717 --> 19:16.851
Seriously?

19:16.894 --> 19:19.070
Okay. Fine.

19:20.376 --> 19:23.031
[loudly]:
Has anyone seen Darnell?

19:23.074 --> 19:25.555
Yeah, he-he sells
all of the drugs.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.470
Oh, wow. Okay.Like, all the time.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.691
Yeah, he's a huge fan
of recreational drug use.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.214
[chuckles]

19:32.258 --> 19:33.476
Yo, shut up.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.261
[laughs]
Didn't think you were here.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.784
What do you want?

19:36.827 --> 19:39.265
I need Tyson's mom's address.Why?

19:39.308 --> 19:41.484
Because I want her to file
a missing persons report.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.878
What did I say to you, huh?
No cops.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.227
Come on, dude, let me help.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.012
You have no idea
how out of your zone you are.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.232
You want to help?
Skip on out of here

19:50.276 --> 19:52.278
and leave me
and my family alone.

20:03.332 --> 20:06.074
Is there a bathroom here?No.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.119
It's a food truck.[sighs]

20:08.163 --> 20:09.338
Come on, how about...

20:09.382 --> 20:11.253
How about a burger?
How about a-a milkshake?

20:11.297 --> 20:13.081
Apparently, I'm a rottweiler
and two Chihuahuas,

20:13.124 --> 20:14.430
so I'm cutting back on carbs.[chuckles]

20:14.474 --> 20:17.259
You know, that was hilarious
what you did to D.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.261
Dude's so serious all the time.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
You know Darnell?Yeah, he's my boy.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.873
So you know Tyson?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.614
His cousin?
A little, yeah.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.312
I need to know where
his mom lives.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.270
Why?

20:28.314 --> 20:32.187
I just do.
Why didn't Darnell
tell you?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.668
Because I didn't ask him.Hmm.

20:34.711 --> 20:38.149
I had come here...
for drugs.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.631
I was picking up
some drugs from him.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.285
What do you want?I don't know.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.679
What do I want?
Depends.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.420
What's good this season?This is so sad.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.118
You're clearly lying
straight to my face.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.511
To be fair, I can't see
where your face is.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.729
Can you just tell me, please?

20:52.773 --> 20:55.079
All right, chill, chill.[sighs]

20:55.123 --> 20:56.559
If you go out with me.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.213
I don't go on dates.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.520
Give me an hour. Come on.

21:05.612 --> 21:06.787
Fine.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.356
One hour.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.097
But you should be
really embarrassed.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.317
Embarrassed is
not my thing.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.365
JESS:
So, he's forcing you
on a date with him

21:19.408 --> 21:22.411
in exchange for the address
of your dead friend's mother?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.283
Yeah.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.893
He sounds great.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.851
[gasps]
There they are.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.592
I can't believe
buying a plastic dong

21:29.636 --> 21:31.594
was your takeaway
from our conversation.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.901
I know what I'm doing.Hmm, do you?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.294
No! That is why
you're here.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.599
Look, as much as I love

21:36.643 --> 21:39.210
that you want me
to pick out your penis,

21:39.254 --> 21:40.603
shouldn't Vanessa
be doing it?

21:40.647 --> 21:41.778
It's a surprise.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.215
Oh, God.Murphy, please help me.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.869
Fine, fine.

21:45.913 --> 21:49.873
Is she more of a garden hose
or soup can gal?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.440
I don't know; these
questions were not

21:51.484 --> 21:53.399
a part of our
courting process.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.269
Do you ladies need some help?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.705
Yes.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.317
On, like, every level, dude.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.104
Come on, come on.I-I'm going. Geez.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.801
Are you hungry?Come on.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.890
Okay, okay. What is the rush?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.327
How do you look?What?

22:08.370 --> 22:11.765
You're not wearing those pants
that Mom hated, are you?

22:11.808 --> 22:13.201
Mom hated my pants?

22:13.244 --> 22:15.334
Just the khaki ones.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.466
Right.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.729
Oh, dear God.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.165

Hi.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.344

up on you.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.910

got cold feet.
Yeah.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.172
Yeah, you came.

22:29.565 --> 22:32.394

single friend, Jade.
Mm-hmm.

of your license plate

kill me or something.

climb the fence.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.702
Of course it is.

this slowly to eat time.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.108
MURPHY:
Shut up.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.552
All right, just put your...
put your leg over.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.336
Just...
That's it.[Murphy grunts]

24:05.052 --> 24:06.880
Hmm.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.403
Where'd you take me?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.406
Sunrise Beach.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.453
It's my, uh... my favorite
view in all of Chicago.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.717
It's gorgeous.

24:20.676 --> 24:23.549
I'm blind, you idiot.

a really long time, Jess.

Surprise.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.241
Okay, yeah. I'm-I'm surprised.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.113
But why are you wearing that?

25:06.156 --> 25:07.375
Oh, y-you know.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.072
Because I don't...
I don't have one.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.378
And I-I... so I bought one.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.032
Murphy picked it out.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.774
And she said that this
was, like,

25:14.817 --> 25:18.125
the right size and width.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.737
So what do you think?

[exhales]

25:26.046 --> 25:27.787
I look stupid.

Are you saying you don't
want a piece of this?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.052
I don't want
a piece of that.

You can't slap it.

What do you mean?

26:38.335 --> 26:40.511
Just being blind,
it's exhausting.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.818
I spent three hours
trying to find a cigarette

I dropped the other day.
It's just my life.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.822
Just exhausting.

26:46.866 --> 26:49.303
Why would you spend that long
looking for a cigarette?

26:49.346 --> 26:52.480
Because they're expensive
and I'm poor.

like that.
