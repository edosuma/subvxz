00:13.455 --> 00:16.691
The Russian people join you
in mourning President Hassan.

00:16.759 --> 00:20.962
We both know the opposition
that undid him had outside help.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.665
I just got off the phone with
the Russian foreign minister.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.966
He said that he would be

00:25.034 --> 00:26.801
coming to the United Nations
in five hours

00:26.869 --> 00:27.969
with the Russian premier

00:28.037 --> 00:29.270
to sign the treaty

00:29.338 --> 00:30.304
as scheduled.

00:30.372 --> 00:32.907
The credit for that
is all yours.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.942
<i>LOGAN:
It's good to be
back in the game.</i>

00:35.010 --> 00:36.711
Elements inside
the Russian government

00:36.779 --> 00:38.680
were behind
both the assassination

00:38.747 --> 00:41.516
of President Hassan
and the supply of

00:41.583 --> 00:43.785
nuclear material to his enemies.

00:43.852 --> 00:45.687
<i>TAYLOR:
The Russian government?</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:46.721
The Russians inserted

00:46.789 --> 00:49.290
Dana Walsh
at CTU months ago.

00:49.358 --> 00:50.558
She's their agent.

00:50.626 --> 00:51.793
If Bauer gets to her,

00:51.860 --> 00:54.796
this will all be finished.

00:54.863 --> 00:57.298
I want to know who
killed Renee Walker.

00:57.366 --> 00:59.400
<i>WALSH:
Renee's dead? I'm sorry.</i>

00:59.468 --> 01:00.902
You're sorry?

01:02.237 --> 01:04.038
(panting)
I can give you the hitter.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.907
I want more than just names;
I want proof!

01:05.974 --> 01:08.209
I have proof.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.912
An audio file. Film.

01:10.979 --> 01:12.513
Where?

01:12.581 --> 01:14.415
First I want
my immunity deal back.

01:14.483 --> 01:16.484
I'm sorry.

01:16.552 --> 01:18.052
I won't give
Dana Walsh immunity.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.822
I believe she knows the names
of the people who facilitated

01:20.889 --> 01:22.590
the assassination
of President Hassan,

01:22.658 --> 01:25.193
people working within
the Russian government.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.728
<i>TAYLOR:
I won't allow it.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.362
You don't want
to know the truth.

01:28.430 --> 01:31.632
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.001
Allegations of this sort
will drive them away.

01:34.069 --> 01:35.503
I've arranged a helicopter

01:35.571 --> 01:38.539
to fly you from CTU
to McGuire Air Force Base.

01:38.607 --> 01:41.109
You're locking me down.

01:42.111 --> 01:43.811
I'm taking this helicopter.

01:43.879 --> 01:46.380
Tell your men to drop their
weapons or you're gonna die.

01:46.448 --> 01:48.116
(dropping weapons)

01:48.183 --> 01:49.484
Out of the copter now!

01:49.551 --> 01:50.685
All security to the helipad.

01:50.753 --> 01:52.620
Security to the helipad now.

01:52.688 --> 01:53.688
Call the FAA, Air Force,

01:53.756 --> 01:55.189
say that we have
a stolen helicopter

01:55.257 --> 01:57.091
that needs to be intercepted
and forced down.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.326
<i>WINNICK:
Yes, ma'am.</i>

02:08.637 --> 02:10.571
CHLOE (over comm):
Jack, it's Chloe.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.073
What are you doing?

02:12.141 --> 02:14.942
Talk to me.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.945
Jack, talk to me.

02:18.013 --> 02:18.980
Can you hear me?

02:19.047 --> 02:20.148
Yeah, he can hear you.

02:20.215 --> 02:21.682
Comm's on,
he's just not answering.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.984
Damn it.

02:23.051 --> 02:24.786
Air Force choppers are
closing in on his position.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.432
PILOT:
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered

02:38.500 --> 02:41.469
to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.772
I repeat,
turn the aircraft around now.

02:56.485 --> 02:57.585
Jack's descending.

02:57.653 --> 02:59.320
Air Force choppers
are in pursuit.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.189
CHLOE:
Jack, this is crazy.

03:01.256 --> 03:02.490
Come back to CTU.

03:18.707 --> 03:20.474
NYPD, this is Ranger One.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.677
Suspect just landed
on the Cooper Building.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.313
We're gonna circle
and maintain visual contact.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.781
DISPATCHER:
Copy that.

03:26.849 --> 03:30.351
We're cordoning off a two-block
radius around the building.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.469
We have a
visual on NYPD.

03:48.537 --> 03:50.504
Two units approaching
the building.

03:50.572 --> 03:51.505
They're one block out.

03:51.573 --> 03:54.609
(sirens wailing)

03:59.548 --> 04:02.350
Suspect's on the fire escape.

04:02.417 --> 04:03.985
<i>He's descending
to ground level.</i>

04:04.052 --> 04:06.487
(sirens wailing)

04:21.603 --> 04:24.405
(sirens wailing)

04:27.943 --> 04:28.943
We've lost him.

04:29.011 --> 04:30.344
Attempting to reacquire.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.334
Dispatch, this is unit 27.

04:53.402 --> 04:55.269
We're at the building,
but we've lost the suspect.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.238
DISPATCHER:
Copy. We'll widen the perimeter.

05:04.413 --> 05:05.880
What the hell is Jack doing?

05:05.948 --> 05:07.715
He's not letting this go,
that's what he's doing.

05:07.783 --> 05:09.617
Dana told him she has
proof about the Russians.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.918
He'll probably
come after her.

05:10.986 --> 05:12.019
That's crazy.
She's locked down.

05:12.087 --> 05:13.521
Jack knows he can't
get to her.

05:13.588 --> 05:16.257
He'll either figure it
out or he'll die trying.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.560
I want you in the field.

05:19.628 --> 05:21.429
Meet with NYPD and coordinate
an interagency search.

05:21.496 --> 05:22.897
Bring in whoever you need.

05:22.965 --> 05:23.898
Yep.

05:23.966 --> 05:25.967
Arlo, use satellite
and traffic cam.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.635
Maybe we can
track him from here.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.136
On it.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.204
(sighs)

05:38.380 --> 05:40.881
Keep me looped in
on the search status.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.517
No, I don't want to be
updated in ten minutes.

05:43.585 --> 05:45.586
I want a real-time uplink.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.928
They still haven't been
able to lock Jack down.

05:53.996 --> 05:55.062
They lost him.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.297
He landed the chopper

05:56.365 --> 05:57.298
and escaped on foot.

05:57.366 --> 05:59.867
NYPD is securing a perimeter.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.370
CTU is coordinating
an interagency search.

06:02.437 --> 06:05.506
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

06:05.574 --> 06:07.608
the agreement
is over.

06:07.676 --> 06:10.244
The peace agreement
may not be the only casualty.

06:12.147 --> 06:14.882
Madam President,

06:14.950 --> 06:16.717
you covered up
the Russians' involvement.

06:16.785 --> 06:20.721
That's grounds
for impeachment.

06:20.789 --> 06:23.724
Possibly a criminal
indictment.

06:25.694 --> 06:27.294
You crossed a line,
Madam President.

06:29.331 --> 06:30.998
But it may not be too late

06:31.066 --> 06:33.234
to step back
and limit the damage.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.303
How?

06:36.371 --> 06:37.705
Expose the Russians.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.775
Grant Dana Walsh immunity
in exchange for evidence.

06:40.842 --> 06:41.942
We'll launch an investigation

06:42.010 --> 06:44.879
through transparent
international channels.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.547
Which will effectively end

06:46.615 --> 06:47.715
the peace deal.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.251
But it will save
your administration.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.555
There is still a chance

06:54.623 --> 06:55.890
CTU will find Jack.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.193
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

06:59.261 --> 07:01.996
Eventually, it will surface.

07:10.172 --> 07:13.908
Allison... I know
better than anyone

07:13.975 --> 07:15.676
how much this means to you.

07:15.744 --> 07:18.279
How much you've sacrificed

07:18.346 --> 07:22.283
personally
to make it happen.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.586
Ethan, we are so close.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.588
And we will be again.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.623
If not during
your administration,

07:29.691 --> 07:31.692
then during the next one.

07:34.629 --> 07:36.931
I wish I could believe that.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.077
Ethan, I want you to prepare...

07:50.145 --> 07:51.345
(sniffles)

07:51.413 --> 07:54.882
a statement
announcing our withdrawal

07:54.950 --> 07:57.151
from this accord.

07:57.219 --> 07:58.252
We have a...
(clears throat)

07:58.320 --> 07:59.620
a press conference
in 40 minutes.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.623
I'll make the announcement then.

08:05.794 --> 08:09.997
As hard as this is,
you're doing the right thing.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.370
(sniffles)

08:46.301 --> 08:47.801
(elevator doors squeak)

08:54.142 --> 08:55.142
Madam President.

09:02.884 --> 09:05.819
It's over, Charles.

09:05.887 --> 09:08.722
I've decided not to go through
with the peace deal.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.491
Because of Bauer.

09:10.559 --> 09:13.027
Because the evidence
implicating the Russians--

09:13.094 --> 09:14.562
evidence that
I helped cover up--

09:14.629 --> 09:16.163
is-is potentially too lethal.

09:16.231 --> 09:18.065
I agree, Madam President.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.768
Doesn't sound like you
have much of a choice.

09:22.771 --> 09:23.938
I'm surprised.

09:24.005 --> 09:26.106
I expected more of
a fight from you.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.108
I'm nothing if not pragmatic.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.945
Although I am
disappointed.

09:31.012 --> 09:35.583
I'm afraid you have to find some
other way to repair your legacy.

09:35.650 --> 09:38.752
My own personal
disappointment aside,

09:38.820 --> 09:41.188
it's a loss
for the world.

09:41.256 --> 09:42.957
Yes, it is.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.962
Ethan's drafting
my statement.

09:48.029 --> 09:51.165
I need to call Dalia Hassan.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.867
Hope that
she'll forgive me for

09:53.935 --> 09:55.703
keeping the truth from her.

09:55.770 --> 09:58.305
Before you do, there is one
thing you might consider.

09:59.841 --> 10:02.009
A way to preserve
the peace deal.

10:02.077 --> 10:04.011
The peace deal is over.

10:04.079 --> 10:05.112
You said so yourself.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.747
I said it was over

10:06.815 --> 10:08.115
if the evidence
comes out.

10:08.183 --> 10:10.918
Obviously, you
can't grant

10:10.986 --> 10:12.419
Walsh immunity.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.089
The evidence would
become public record.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.692
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.027
Off the grid?

10:20.095 --> 10:22.429
Classify her as
an enemy combatant

10:22.497 --> 10:23.998
and incarcerate her
in a private facility.

10:24.065 --> 10:26.166
There is a private

10:26.234 --> 10:27.601
security firm I can recommend.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.105
They're effective
and discreet.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.508
I have them standing by.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.514
Sounds like you've been
giving this a lot of thought.

10:40.582 --> 10:41.649
Madam President,

10:41.716 --> 10:44.318
this evidence is
hanging over your head.

10:44.386 --> 10:45.786
You need to deal with it.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.789
We can't keep Walsh
locked up indefinitely.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.157
You wouldn't have to.

10:50.225 --> 10:54.428
Ms. Walsh may not give up
the information willingly,

10:54.496 --> 10:56.430
but she will give it up.

10:56.498 --> 11:00.734
And once we have it, it won't
matter what she claims.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.139
You're talking about
using physical coercion.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.341
I know how deeply
this offends

11:07.409 --> 11:09.076
your public and private
sensibilities.

11:09.144 --> 11:10.477
It is repugnant,

11:10.545 --> 11:13.013
even immoral.

11:13.081 --> 11:15.182
But isn't morality relative,

11:15.250 --> 11:17.451
considering what's
at stake here?

11:17.519 --> 11:21.155
You are still
talking about torture.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.357
I'm talking about
preserving a peace accord

11:23.425 --> 11:25.492
that is crucial to the
security of this nation.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.528
And that can only
happen if you

11:27.595 --> 11:29.963
acquire and control
the evidence.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.034
Believe me, Madam President,

11:34.102 --> 11:35.836
I don't make
these suggestions lightly.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.638
I appreciate the implications.

11:37.706 --> 11:40.174
I've tried to be as open
and candid with you

11:40.241 --> 11:41.608
as I've been
with anyone.

11:41.676 --> 11:42.910
And the truth is,

11:42.977 --> 11:46.814
I regret many of my own actions
when I was president.

11:46.881 --> 11:48.882
But I've also had the
time and the distance

11:48.950 --> 11:53.320
to see past them to a place
of clear and deep understanding.

11:55.023 --> 11:56.824
What do you understand, Charles?

11:56.891 --> 12:00.527
Wielding the kind of power
that I once had and you have now

12:00.595 --> 12:01.829
can change the world.

12:01.896 --> 12:04.131
But that often
requires making

12:04.199 --> 12:06.266
impossible choices

12:06.334 --> 12:08.836
that challenge
our most sacred ideals.

12:10.872 --> 12:13.507
If you're not
willing to do that,

12:13.575 --> 12:17.044
you should take Ethan's advice
and pull out now.

12:32.373 --> 12:34.007
This was taken eight minutes ago

12:34.075 --> 12:36.076
on the corner
of 25th and Cleveland.

12:39.147 --> 12:41.815
Give Cole this information,
have him redirect his search.

12:41.883 --> 12:42.883
Ms. O'Brian.

12:42.951 --> 12:45.118
I have President Taylor
calling for you.

12:45.186 --> 12:46.820
Put her through.

12:46.888 --> 12:49.056
CHLOE (on phone):
Madam President, Chloe O'Brian.

12:49.123 --> 12:51.725
Have you made any progress
in finding Jack Bauer?

12:51.793 --> 12:53.460
Not yet. We're
still searching.

12:53.528 --> 12:54.761
I think it's
safe to assume

12:54.829 --> 12:56.563
he's on his way
to CTU and that

12:56.631 --> 12:58.498
Dana Walsh is his target.

12:58.566 --> 13:00.667
That's, that's why
I'm calling, Chloe.

13:00.735 --> 13:02.669
I want Walsh
transferred

13:02.737 --> 13:05.672
to a safe house
off-site.

13:05.740 --> 13:08.442
Madam President, I've doubled
the security around Dana Walsh.

13:08.509 --> 13:10.611
I'm confident thiss
the safest place for her to be.

13:10.678 --> 13:14.548
Your opinion notwithstanding,
I'd feel more comfortable

13:14.616 --> 13:17.150
with her in a place
where she can't be tracked.

13:17.218 --> 13:20.487
Agents from a
private security firm

13:20.555 --> 13:22.189
are coming there
to pick her up.

13:22.257 --> 13:24.758
A private security firm?

13:24.826 --> 13:27.961
You know as well as I do
that Jack has contacts

13:28.029 --> 13:30.364
throughout the
government, some of whom

13:30.431 --> 13:32.566
might be sympathetic
to his situation.

13:34.569 --> 13:38.305
I'm not suggesting that you're
one of those people, Chloe.

13:38.373 --> 13:42.843
I just, I just want to take
every precaution.

13:42.910 --> 13:44.011
Yes, ma'am.

13:44.078 --> 13:46.513
I'm sending over the
transfer order now.

13:46.581 --> 13:48.615
The agent in charge
of the escort team

13:48.683 --> 13:50.984
is named Mark Bledsoe.

13:51.052 --> 13:53.086
Should be arriving
there in a few minutes.

13:53.154 --> 13:54.855
Understood.

13:54.922 --> 13:56.023
Thank you, Chloe.

13:57.592 --> 14:00.193
I know this was difficult,
Madam President,

14:00.261 --> 14:02.462
but you made the right call.

14:04.165 --> 14:07.768
These men of yours, I want
them to use every method of

14:07.835 --> 14:10.003
noncoercive interrogation
available to them.

14:10.071 --> 14:12.372
I've already given
that standing order.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.341
No one wants this to get ugly.

14:14.409 --> 14:17.010
Oh, it's already ugly, Charles.

14:19.013 --> 14:21.815
(car horns honking)

14:27.221 --> 14:29.089
Thanks. I don't need
the chargers.

14:34.028 --> 14:37.130
(phone line ringing)

14:37.198 --> 14:39.099
O'Brian.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.667
Chloe, it's Jack.

14:40.735 --> 14:43.203
Jack. Please, come back now.

14:43.271 --> 14:44.571
This has got to stop.

14:44.639 --> 14:46.673
I need you to get me
access to Dana Walsh.

14:46.741 --> 14:48.875
The president said she's lying.

14:48.943 --> 14:50.377
No, it's the president
who's lying.

14:50.445 --> 14:52.346
She's covering up the evidence
to protect the peace agreement.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.681
Even if she is,
she must have good reason.

14:54.749 --> 14:57.351
Besides, it's not your call,
it's the president's.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.552
She's covering up evidence

14:58.619 --> 14:59.953
of a terrorist attack
against this country.

15:00.021 --> 15:01.288
She no longer has the call.

15:01.356 --> 15:03.957
You don't want to go
against me on this.

15:04.025 --> 15:06.360
Are you threatening me?

15:06.427 --> 15:09.262
Chloe, I'm trying
to ask you for help.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.431
I need you to put me in
a room with Dana Walsh.

15:11.499 --> 15:12.432
You're being hunted by every

15:12.500 --> 15:13.600
law enforcement agency
in the city.

15:13.668 --> 15:14.868
You're not thinking clearly.

15:14.936 --> 15:17.604
Right now,
I'm the only one who is.

15:17.672 --> 15:20.073
You can't just
go against everyone.

15:20.141 --> 15:22.743
Please, just come in here,
and we'll figure this out

15:22.810 --> 15:24.811
before you get
yourself killed.

15:24.879 --> 15:26.046
You know what,
forget it, Chloe.

15:26.114 --> 15:27.080
I'll figure out
another way.

15:27.148 --> 15:28.215
Jack, wait.

15:28.282 --> 15:30.417
What?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.454
If you do get the evidence
from Dana,

15:34.522 --> 15:35.989
what are you gonna do with it?

15:36.057 --> 15:37.991
(panting)

15:38.059 --> 15:40.394
I just want the people
who are responsible for this

15:40.461 --> 15:41.495
to be held accountable.

15:41.562 --> 15:43.964
All I need to do is expose them.

15:49.404 --> 15:51.471
The president's having her
transferred out of CTU.

15:51.539 --> 15:53.140
Why?

15:53.207 --> 15:54.174
I'm not sure.

15:54.242 --> 15:55.509
She hired a private
security firm.

15:55.576 --> 15:56.676
Where are they taking her?

15:56.744 --> 15:58.178
I don't know.

15:58.246 --> 16:00.113
Find out.
I'll call you back.

16:01.149 --> 16:03.083
Chloe.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.651
Okay. I will.

16:04.719 --> 16:06.720
Thanks.

16:18.533 --> 16:21.301
(phone ringing)

16:31.546 --> 16:32.813
Yes?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.214
Jim, it's Jack Bauer.

16:34.282 --> 16:36.550
Jack Bauer.

16:36.617 --> 16:39.386
From what I'm hearing, you got
the whole damn city after you.

16:39.454 --> 16:40.554
Look, I need your help.

16:40.621 --> 16:42.055
I'm running out of places to go.

16:42.123 --> 16:43.056
Running out?

16:43.124 --> 16:44.524
(wry chuckle)

16:44.592 --> 16:45.826
I'd say gone.

16:45.893 --> 16:47.894
What'd you do
this time, Jack?

16:47.962 --> 16:49.229
The less you know,
the better.

16:49.297 --> 16:50.964
For who?
For both of us.
Look.

16:51.032 --> 16:52.566
I'm gonna need weapons and
equipment; I need it fast.

16:52.633 --> 16:53.567
Can you make that happen?

16:53.634 --> 16:55.502
I can make just about

16:55.570 --> 16:57.537
anything happen, Jack;
you already know that.

16:57.605 --> 17:00.173
The problem is that you're
a walking bull's-eye.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.776
Last thing in the world I
need is you on my doorstep.

17:02.844 --> 17:04.877
You wouldn't have a doorstep
if it wasn't for me.

17:04.945 --> 17:05.945
I'm calling in a favor.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.247
I'm gonna tell you
what I want,

17:07.315 --> 17:08.882
and I want it ready
when I get there.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.250
You understand me?

17:10.318 --> 17:12.919
Well, I see you haven't
lost your personal touch.

17:12.987 --> 17:15.321
I'm gonna need a comm unit,
two MP5s,

17:15.388 --> 17:17.022
an assortment of assault rifles

17:17.090 --> 17:19.192
and ammo, a full communication

17:19.260 --> 17:20.794
and surveillance package.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.529
I'll be there in ten minutes.

17:33.374 --> 17:34.374
(phone line ringing)

17:34.442 --> 17:35.876
Yeah?

17:35.943 --> 17:37.444
It's me. We're at CTU.

17:37.512 --> 17:38.445
You have Walsh?

17:38.513 --> 17:39.579
Not yet. I wanted to

17:39.647 --> 17:40.947
talk about something
before we proceeded.

17:41.015 --> 17:42.115
Is there a problem?

17:42.183 --> 17:44.017
We put this team
together on short notice,

17:44.085 --> 17:46.253
and we never had a chance
to discuss what to do with

17:46.320 --> 17:47.554
the prisoner once we've
extracted the information.

17:47.622 --> 17:48.989
Hand her
back to CTU.

17:49.056 --> 17:51.024
Without the evidence, she has
no teeth; she can't hurt us.

17:51.092 --> 17:52.492
Well, she can make accusations.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.394
Even without the evidence,
something might stick.

17:54.462 --> 17:55.662
You can't afford that.

17:55.730 --> 17:56.863
What are you suggesting?

17:56.931 --> 17:59.432
We can make it look like
the prisoner was killed

17:59.500 --> 18:00.767
while she was
trying to escape.

18:00.835 --> 18:02.168
Wouldn't be difficult.

18:02.236 --> 18:04.237
I'm not sure we're willing
to go down that path.

18:04.305 --> 18:06.006
You hired me
to clean up this situation.

18:06.073 --> 18:08.008
In my professional opinion,
that's what needs to happen.

18:08.075 --> 18:10.977
Talk it over with the client,
but I need to know soon.

18:11.045 --> 18:13.046
Sir?

18:13.114 --> 18:14.681
Yes, okay, I'll let you know.

18:25.026 --> 18:25.959
Mr. Bledsoe?

18:26.027 --> 18:26.993
That's right.

18:27.061 --> 18:28.461
Chloe O'Brian,
acting director of CTU.

18:28.529 --> 18:30.163
Heard you've had a rough day.

18:30.231 --> 18:31.164
Yeah, you could say that.

18:31.232 --> 18:32.198
I'll take you to Dana Walsh.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.266
Thank you.

18:34.936 --> 18:36.169
Where exactly are
you taking her?

18:36.237 --> 18:37.304
I can't disclose
that information.

18:37.371 --> 18:39.072
The whole point of
this exercise is to keep Walsh

18:39.140 --> 18:40.273
off the grid.

18:40.341 --> 18:42.442
Yes, but I'm responsible
for this prisoner.

18:42.510 --> 18:44.945
You were given a presidential
order to turn over the prisoner.

18:45.012 --> 18:46.713
Actually, I'm gonna need
to see that order.

18:46.781 --> 18:48.582
You should've
received it already.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.250
Well, we didn't.
Like you said, we've had

18:50.318 --> 18:51.985
a rough day.
We were hit by an EMP

18:52.053 --> 18:53.720
and most of our systems
are still down.

18:53.788 --> 18:55.322
Ms. O'Brian, we don't
have a lot of time.

18:55.389 --> 18:58.558
Look, I can't let you take her
unless I see the order.

18:58.626 --> 18:59.960
So, you can wait.

19:00.027 --> 19:01.595
Might take an hour, maybe more.

19:10.905 --> 19:11.905
Thank you.

19:11.973 --> 19:13.006
I'm sorry to be
so by-the-book.

19:13.074 --> 19:14.240
It's-- I was
just promoted

19:14.308 --> 19:16.776
to this position,
and I just want to make sure

19:16.844 --> 19:19.312
that I dot all my I's
and cross the T's.
Right.

19:23.718 --> 19:24.651
Satisfied?

19:24.719 --> 19:25.852
Yeah, great.

19:32.126 --> 19:33.059
Good morning, Ms. Walsh.

19:33.127 --> 19:34.327
My name is Mark Bledsoe.

19:34.395 --> 19:35.729
The president's
ordered your transfer

19:35.796 --> 19:36.963
to an off-site
facility.

19:37.031 --> 19:39.032
You've been designated
an enemy combatant

19:39.100 --> 19:40.100
by special
executive order.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.769
What do you mean
off-site facility?

19:42.837 --> 19:44.437
It's a secure location.

19:44.505 --> 19:46.006
Chloe, what the hell
is going on?

19:46.073 --> 19:47.007
Where's Bauer?

19:47.074 --> 19:48.475
Where's my immunity deal?

19:48.542 --> 19:49.843
Just do what he says, Dana.

19:49.910 --> 19:51.378
We can do it the hard way
or the easy way--

19:51.445 --> 19:53.113
your choice--
but you're leaving here with us.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.115
Chloe, don't let them do this.
Let's go.

19:55.182 --> 19:57.484
Please, they're gonna kill me.
Chloe...

19:57.551 --> 19:58.718
Chloe, please.

19:58.786 --> 20:00.020
Chloe!

20:03.024 --> 20:05.892
Thank you
for your cooperation.

20:22.243 --> 20:24.244
(sighs)

20:43.898 --> 20:45.432
All right, let's get units
on these two intersections.

20:45.499 --> 20:46.833
(cell phone ringing)
Have them run car checks

20:46.901 --> 20:48.134
on anyone
passing through.

20:48.202 --> 20:49.302
I'll contact
Transit Police,

20:49.370 --> 20:50.937
see about getting these
subways locked down.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.841
Chloe, we're still in the middle
of a grid search here.

20:54.909 --> 20:55.909
No sign of Jack.

20:55.976 --> 20:57.577
I just talked to him;
he called me.

20:57.645 --> 20:59.879
What?
He wants me to
help him get to Dana.

20:59.947 --> 21:01.214
What did you
tell him?

21:01.282 --> 21:02.882
I told him that she's
being transferred to

21:02.950 --> 21:05.185
an off-site facility and that
I would give him the address.

21:05.252 --> 21:07.687
And I almost did.

21:07.755 --> 21:08.688
But I can't.

21:08.756 --> 21:09.889
I'm under presidential orders.

21:09.957 --> 21:11.958
Besides, I don't think
he's right.

21:12.026 --> 21:14.094
He's not thinking clearly.

21:14.161 --> 21:17.297
We have to find him
before he gets himself killed.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.067
What if Jack is
thinking clearly?

21:21.135 --> 21:22.736
If he's right,
if the president's lying,

21:22.803 --> 21:23.903
and this conspiracy
is real,

21:23.971 --> 21:25.905
we might be on the
wrong side of this.

21:25.973 --> 21:28.341
Bottom line is, we were given
orders to bring him in.

21:28.409 --> 21:29.876
That's what we're gonna do.

21:29.944 --> 21:30.944
All right.

21:43.657 --> 21:45.692
I need everyone's
attention, please.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.794
We're mobilizing a sting
operation in the field

21:47.862 --> 21:49.729
to be led by
Agent Ortiz.

21:49.797 --> 21:51.865
The target is Jack Bauer.

21:55.302 --> 21:56.803
Let's get to work.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.234
Did you get what I need?

22:34.301 --> 22:37.370
Nice to see you
again, too, Jack.

22:37.438 --> 22:39.205
Did you get it or not?

22:39.273 --> 22:41.407
Yeah, it's right over there.

22:43.711 --> 22:47.447
Everything you asked
for-- right there.

22:49.883 --> 22:51.417
I've been checking
the scanners.

22:51.485 --> 22:53.353
All the agencies
are looking for you.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.587
But nobody will say
what you did.

22:54.655 --> 22:56.923
It's not about what I did.

22:56.991 --> 22:59.292
They're afraid
of what I'm gonna do.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.661
I don't know what
they did to you, Jack,

23:01.729 --> 23:03.630
but it must have
been pretty bad.

23:03.697 --> 23:05.265
I got to make a phone call.

23:09.136 --> 23:10.503
O'Brian.
Hey, it's me.

23:10.571 --> 23:12.505
You find out where
they're taking Dana?

23:12.573 --> 23:15.008
Jack, I want you to think
about what you're doing.

23:15.075 --> 23:16.509
Just give me the
address, Chloe.

23:16.577 --> 23:18.111
It's not too late
to turn yourself in.

23:18.178 --> 23:20.380
Are you going to give
me the address or not?

23:25.119 --> 23:27.787
Dana is being taken to a safe
house in the Middle Village.

23:27.855 --> 23:32.125
It's an industrial laundry
at 141 Juniper Valley Road.

23:34.495 --> 23:36.929
Okay, that's about ten minutes
from here. I'll leave now.

23:36.997 --> 23:38.231
Call me when you arrive.

23:38.299 --> 23:40.199
I'm working on pulling up
the interior specs.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.001
I'll be able to guide you in.

23:42.069 --> 23:44.237
Chloe, thanks. I know
I've put you in a spot.

23:44.305 --> 23:45.371
Yeah.

23:45.439 --> 23:46.906
I'll get back to you.

23:51.845 --> 23:54.080
I need you to stay here.

23:54.148 --> 23:56.115
I might need you later.

23:56.183 --> 23:57.884
You can't come back
here again.

23:57.951 --> 23:59.052
Besides that,
we're even now.

23:59.119 --> 24:00.753
I'll let you know
when we're even.

24:03.157 --> 24:04.924
Jim, please.

24:04.992 --> 24:06.659
I need your help, okay?

24:17.805 --> 24:19.972
Did O'Brian brief you?
Yes, sir.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.507
We're drawing Bauer
to this location

24:21.575 --> 24:23.142
where he thinks Dana
Walsh is being held.

24:23.210 --> 24:25.445
It's an industrial laundry
the DEA seized a year ago.

24:25.512 --> 24:26.913
CTU's been using it
as a safe house,

24:26.980 --> 24:28.481
but there's no way
Jack can know this.

24:28.549 --> 24:30.149
Understand, Bauer's
a highly skilled operative.

24:30.217 --> 24:32.652
So we need to make everything
as credible as possible.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.620
He'll be expecting sentries,

24:34.688 --> 24:35.655
so Beck, you're out front.

24:35.723 --> 24:36.789
Greer, you take the back.

24:36.857 --> 24:38.691
You two will be
stationed inside.

24:38.759 --> 24:39.992
Everyone stays out of sight

24:40.060 --> 24:41.427
until Jack's
between our choke points.

24:41.495 --> 24:43.930
We do the takedown when, and
only when I give the order.

24:43.997 --> 24:46.766
We get this right,
we take Jack by surprise

24:46.834 --> 24:48.368
before he has a chance
to fight back.

24:48.435 --> 24:49.602
Gear up.

24:49.670 --> 24:50.870
Cole.

24:50.938 --> 24:52.338
Jack just called.
He's ten minutes out.

24:52.406 --> 24:54.540
What's your status?
We're on-site and getting ready.

24:54.608 --> 24:57.543
Remember, nonlethal force.

24:57.611 --> 24:59.278
Look, I don't want anything
to happen to Jack either,

24:59.346 --> 25:02.115
but I can't tell my men
not to defend themselves

25:02.182 --> 25:04.517
if their lives
are in danger.
You know that.

25:04.585 --> 25:05.818
He's calling me
when he arrives.

25:05.886 --> 25:07.520
I'll let you know
when that happens.

25:07.588 --> 25:09.355
All right.

25:09.423 --> 25:11.324
Let's go, guys, let's go.

25:14.795 --> 25:15.995
Madam President.

25:16.063 --> 25:19.665
I have a final draft
of your statement.

25:19.733 --> 25:23.002
I think it best for now to cite
President Hassan's death

25:23.070 --> 25:25.304
as the reason
for your withdrawing.

25:25.372 --> 25:28.074
Then after the dust has settled,

25:28.142 --> 25:30.543
we can start prosecuting the
Russians through back channels.

25:30.611 --> 25:34.013
Ethan, I've chosen
not to withdraw

25:34.081 --> 25:35.581
from the peace agreement.

25:37.418 --> 25:40.253
And I'm keeping the press
conference as scheduled.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.588
I don't understand.

25:42.656 --> 25:45.258
Dana Walsh is being moved
from CTU

25:45.325 --> 25:46.759
to a private detention facility.

25:46.827 --> 25:49.228
She'll be off the grid,

25:49.296 --> 25:51.697
out of Jack Bauer's reach.

25:51.765 --> 25:54.734
I've authorized a private
interrogation team

25:54.802 --> 25:57.770
to acquire the evidence.

25:59.706 --> 26:01.607
Acquire the evidence?

26:01.675 --> 26:04.410
Once we have it,
she'll be irrelevant.

26:04.478 --> 26:05.711
(scoffs)

26:05.779 --> 26:08.381
Keeping the truth
from Jack Bauer is one thing--

26:08.449 --> 26:12.018
but authorizing
the illegal detention

26:12.085 --> 26:13.519
and torture of a prisoner?

26:13.587 --> 26:15.121
How far are you willing to go

26:15.189 --> 26:16.322
to protect this lie?

26:16.390 --> 26:18.424
As far as necessary
to preserve this treaty.

26:18.492 --> 26:20.560
It's vital to the security

26:20.627 --> 26:22.628
of this nation.

26:22.696 --> 26:23.930
And what I am doing

26:23.997 --> 26:25.631
is for the greater good.

26:27.267 --> 26:30.069
This was Logan's idea,
wasn't it?

26:30.137 --> 26:33.573
The decision was mine.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.209
And I stand behind it.

26:36.276 --> 26:39.045
Now listen--

26:39.112 --> 26:41.581
please listen to
what I'm saying.

26:41.648 --> 26:43.082
I think this is about more

26:43.150 --> 26:45.084
than the grÃƒÂ‘ater good.

26:45.152 --> 26:47.487
I think your presidency

26:47.554 --> 26:50.690
has cost you your marriage
and your children.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.058
And you think
that this treaty

26:52.125 --> 26:54.560
will somehow redeem
that loss...

26:54.628 --> 26:55.628
Ethan, that's enough.

26:55.696 --> 26:57.964
Now, listen, you've
made this personal,

26:58.031 --> 26:59.565
and you've lost your way.

26:59.633 --> 27:01.968
I've known you long
enough to see that.

27:02.035 --> 27:04.937
I implore you--

27:05.005 --> 27:07.473
take a step back
and look at this clearly.

27:07.541 --> 27:09.775
I said that's enough.

27:09.843 --> 27:11.944
I've explained
my reasons.

27:12.012 --> 27:16.015
I appreciate your objections,
but the debate is over.

27:18.318 --> 27:21.220
So, let's move on.

27:27.261 --> 27:28.528
Madam President,

27:28.595 --> 27:34.600
unless you stop what's
being done in your name,

27:34.668 --> 27:37.937
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

27:38.005 --> 27:41.173
Don't worry, I'll...
I'll keep it to myself.

27:41.241 --> 27:44.644
Um, I'll cite my health as
the reason for my resignation.

27:44.711 --> 27:47.880
After all, I'm here
against doctor's orders.

27:47.948 --> 27:51.684
Ethan, please.

27:51.752 --> 27:53.953
We are almost there!

27:54.021 --> 27:56.122
You-you can't just abandon me
like this.

27:56.189 --> 27:58.424
I'm not abandoning you.

27:58.492 --> 28:02.094
I'm listening to my conscience.

28:02.162 --> 28:05.097
Anyway,

28:05.165 --> 28:07.433
you've got Charles Logan now.

28:07.501 --> 28:10.169
Only room for one of us.

28:12.873 --> 28:14.640
Madam President.

28:17.411 --> 28:19.579
(door opens, then closes)

28:34.452 --> 28:36.386
Look at me.
My hand is shaking.

28:36.454 --> 28:38.455
I would be concerned
if it weren't.

28:38.523 --> 28:40.157
What you've agreed
to take on

28:40.224 --> 28:42.225
is not something
that could be treated lightly.

28:42.293 --> 28:44.294
I keep thinking
that people will accuse me

28:44.362 --> 28:46.229
of grabbing for power.

28:46.297 --> 28:48.765
Exploiting my husband's death.

28:48.833 --> 28:51.435
Which couldn't be further
from the truth.

28:51.502 --> 28:55.372
Still, some people may
perceive it that way.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.041
Remember what
father said?

28:58.109 --> 29:00.043
He said the best
way to dispel

29:00.111 --> 29:03.880
public misperception
is to address it directly.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.684
Good.

29:07.752 --> 29:10.053
I will take his advice.

29:11.589 --> 29:13.623
Jamot, will you
excuse us?

29:13.691 --> 29:15.392
Of course.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.461
I just need to remind you
that the other delegates

29:17.528 --> 29:19.463
are expecting you in 20 minutes.

29:19.530 --> 29:21.298
I'll be ready.

29:21.366 --> 29:23.300
Miss Kayla.

29:23.368 --> 29:25.635
Jamot.

29:28.406 --> 29:30.941
Mother, I'm sorry
for being so selfish earlier.

29:31.008 --> 29:32.476
You were afraid.

29:33.878 --> 29:35.479
You lost your father today.

29:35.546 --> 29:37.547
And you were afraid
of losing me as well.

29:37.615 --> 29:41.885
I still am.

29:46.023 --> 29:49.426
This peace agreement
Father died for--

29:49.494 --> 29:53.663
how can so many people be
so violently against it?

29:53.731 --> 29:58.435
Some people are so invested
in their fear and hatred

29:58.503 --> 30:02.072
that peace is the most
threatening thing

30:02.140 --> 30:04.608
they can imagine.

30:25.196 --> 30:26.363
Chloe, you still there?

30:26.431 --> 30:27.597
CHLOE (over comm):
Yes.

30:27.665 --> 30:29.599
I'm at the site.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.368
I only see one man out front.

30:31.436 --> 30:33.003
I found a schematic
of the building.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.972
There's a side entrance to the
north of the loading dock.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.108
I got it.

30:38.176 --> 30:40.143
It looks like it's out of
the sentry's line of sight.

30:40.211 --> 30:42.512
According to
the schematic,

30:42.580 --> 30:44.915
there's an enclosed room
at the southwest corner
of the building.

30:44.982 --> 30:46.349
That must be where
they're keeping Dana.

30:46.417 --> 30:48.552
Copy that. Chloe, I got go.
I'm moving in.

31:10.842 --> 31:13.143
Cole, he's going into the
loading dock entrance

31:13.211 --> 31:14.311
heading towards
the takedown point.

31:14.378 --> 31:16.913
COLE:
I see him.

31:16.981 --> 31:19.015
Hopkins, Lee,

31:19.083 --> 31:20.951
Jack's moving into the building
and headed toward your position.

31:21.018 --> 31:21.985
Stay sharp.

31:22.053 --> 31:23.553
Copy that. We're ready.

31:52.116 --> 31:53.383
(clattering)

32:09.934 --> 32:10.934
(taps twice)

32:25.383 --> 32:27.217
Chloe, it's Jack.

32:27.285 --> 32:28.985
I got a visual
on the room.

32:29.053 --> 32:30.153
No hostiles in sight.

32:30.221 --> 32:31.721
I'm going to try
and grab her.

32:31.789 --> 32:33.423
Be careful, Jack.

32:33.491 --> 32:35.091
Okay, copy that.

32:35.159 --> 32:36.493
(panting)

32:45.169 --> 32:47.737
(grunts)

32:52.643 --> 32:55.579
Cole, he's almost
at the takedown point.

32:55.646 --> 32:57.747
Copy that.
On my way.

32:57.815 --> 32:59.916
Hopkins, we're moving in.

33:28.713 --> 33:30.814
Son of a bitch.

33:42.994 --> 33:44.628
Put your weapons down!

33:44.695 --> 33:45.862
Put your weapons down now!

33:45.930 --> 33:47.263
I can't do that, Jack!

33:47.331 --> 33:49.232
Cole, tell them to put
their weapons down or
I will kill him!

33:49.300 --> 33:50.934
COLE:
Put that gun down now!

33:51.002 --> 33:52.669
Put your weapons down now!

33:52.737 --> 33:57.007
Now!
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!

33:59.844 --> 34:01.144
Tell your men to get down.

34:01.212 --> 34:03.346
Do it.
Get on the ground.

34:03.414 --> 34:04.347
Now!

34:04.415 --> 34:06.683
Cole, slowly advance towards me.

34:09.887 --> 34:12.422
Kick the guns over
in my direction.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.695
Get out of my line of sight.

34:18.763 --> 34:20.163
How did you know?

34:20.231 --> 34:22.498
I know Chloe.

34:22.565 --> 34:24.333
You're gonna call CTU.

34:24.402 --> 34:25.735
You're gonna tell her
that her plan worked,

34:25.803 --> 34:27.603
and you've got me locked down
and ready for transport.

34:27.672 --> 34:29.639
Put it on speaker.

34:32.376 --> 34:34.277
CHLOE (on speakerphone):
O'Brian.

34:34.344 --> 34:35.812
Chloe, it's Cole.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.514
Cole, go ahead.
What's happening?

34:37.581 --> 34:39.149
We've got Jack.
He's locked down.

34:39.216 --> 34:40.283
Is he okay?

34:40.351 --> 34:41.351
He's fine.

34:44.088 --> 34:45.221
What about your men?

34:45.289 --> 34:46.690
They're all right.

34:46.757 --> 34:49.324
I know I should feel relieved,
but I just feel worse.

34:49.393 --> 34:51.226
Like you said, Chloe,

34:51.295 --> 34:52.996
it's for his own good.

34:53.063 --> 34:56.032
I'll talk to him
when he gets here.

34:59.203 --> 35:02.405
Lock your men down.
What are you
planning on doing?

35:02.473 --> 35:03.573
Lock 'em down!

35:24.358 --> 35:26.159
All right, Jack,
what now?

35:26.226 --> 35:28.361
JACK: Follow me.

35:36.370 --> 35:37.670
Take a seat.

35:40.707 --> 35:42.809
You're why
I'm here, Cole.

35:42.876 --> 35:44.510
I knew Chloe
would send you.

35:44.578 --> 35:46.279
You're the only
reason I risked it.

35:46.346 --> 35:47.547
What do you want with me?

35:47.614 --> 35:49.949
I need you to help me
gain access to Dana Walsh.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.417
I know you well
enough, Cole,

35:51.485 --> 35:52.819
that I know you
don't want

35:52.886 --> 35:54.320
to be a part of
this cover-up.

35:54.388 --> 35:55.655
And right now
President Taylor

35:55.722 --> 35:57.824
wants the peace agreement
to move forward so badly,

35:57.891 --> 35:59.659
she's willing to lie about
the Russian's involvement

35:59.726 --> 36:00.760
in today's terrorist attack,

36:00.828 --> 36:01.994
and I can't let
that happen.

36:02.062 --> 36:03.863
How can you be sure
the President is lying?

36:03.931 --> 36:06.165
Because she told me to my face!

36:06.233 --> 36:07.767
She said the agreement
was more important

36:07.835 --> 36:09.302
than the Russians
could have done today.

36:09.369 --> 36:10.369
Why the hell do you think

36:10.437 --> 36:11.904
she came down
to CTU to talk to me?

36:11.972 --> 36:14.140
She didn't want me
to give the evidence
from Dana.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.476
She wanted to shut me up
and lock me down

36:16.543 --> 36:18.811
Damn it, Cole, your hands
aren't clean in this.

36:18.879 --> 36:20.913
You protected Dana
while she was

36:20.981 --> 36:22.215
operating for
the Russians.

36:22.282 --> 36:24.217
You lied for her,
which enabled the Russians

36:24.284 --> 36:26.853
to provide nuclear materials
to Hassan's opposition.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.288
They facilitated his
assassination and what,

36:29.356 --> 36:31.424
you lost four
of your men today, right?

36:31.492 --> 36:33.826
I am giving you
an opportunity to
make this right,

36:33.894 --> 36:36.095
to make the people that are
responsible for everything

36:36.163 --> 36:37.230
that happened today
accountable.

36:39.766 --> 36:42.301
You got a decision to make.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.003
Now, what if you're wrong?

36:44.071 --> 36:45.805
I'm not.

36:51.678 --> 36:54.313
Look, I can't do
this on my own.

37:00.254 --> 37:01.754
Your call.

37:12.199 --> 37:15.701
Chloe says she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

37:15.769 --> 37:17.036
We'll notify CTU
about your men

37:17.104 --> 37:18.604
within the next two hours.

37:18.672 --> 37:21.541
Right now it's imperative that
they think I took you hostage.

37:21.608 --> 37:23.643
Get up!

37:29.816 --> 37:31.417
<i>REPORTER:
We've been hearing speculation</i>

37:31.485 --> 37:33.085
<i>that Dalia Hassan
will be making</i>

37:33.153 --> 37:34.320
<i>her first official statement</i>

37:34.388 --> 37:36.055
<i>as the provisional head
of state</i>

37:36.123 --> 37:38.057
<i>of the Islamic Republic
of Kamistan.</i>

37:38.125 --> 37:40.760
<i>Earlier, we spoke to a UN
official who confirmed</i>

37:40.827 --> 37:43.162
<i>that under the IRK's
constitution,</i>

37:43.230 --> 37:44.797
<i>Mrs. Hassan would have
the authority</i>

37:44.865 --> 37:46.866
<i>to sign this treaty.
Ethan! (turns TV off)</i>

37:46.934 --> 37:51.437
I, uh, I heard about
your resignation.

37:51.505 --> 37:53.639
I'm glad to see you're putting
your health first.

37:53.707 --> 37:55.274
We all just want

37:55.342 --> 37:56.842
you to get well.

37:56.910 --> 38:00.479
I'm leaving
because of you.

38:00.547 --> 38:03.249
Because of what
you've started here.

38:03.317 --> 38:06.152
You've deliberately
played this out

38:06.220 --> 38:09.188
to maneuver the President
into a corner.

38:10.991 --> 38:14.160
I brought the Russians back
to the table.

38:14.228 --> 38:16.329
But you didn't tell her
how you were doing it.

38:16.396 --> 38:17.396
She didn't ask.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.765
Because she knew
it was best for her

38:19.833 --> 38:21.634
to preserve her own deniability.

38:21.702 --> 38:24.704
The President knows
exactly what she's doing.

38:24.771 --> 38:26.138
She's smart.

38:26.206 --> 38:29.041
She's smarter than either of us
ever gave her credit for.

38:29.109 --> 38:30.343
I see.

38:30.410 --> 38:33.145
So, uh, you just
provided counsel.

38:33.213 --> 38:35.648
That's right.

38:35.716 --> 38:39.185
Well, let me counsel you.

38:39.253 --> 38:42.188
Stop this cover-up
before it's too late.

38:42.256 --> 38:44.490
This peace is no good.

38:44.558 --> 38:46.359
There's too much blood
on this treaty

38:46.426 --> 38:47.727
for it ever to hold.

38:47.794 --> 38:50.396
We've both been in this game
a long time,

38:50.464 --> 38:52.231
and we both know damn well

38:52.299 --> 38:54.700
that every treaty ever written
had blood on it!

38:54.768 --> 38:56.902
Not like this.

38:56.970 --> 38:58.838
You got Allison so far
into the woods,

38:58.905 --> 39:01.040
she'll never be able
to find her way out.

39:01.108 --> 39:04.710
She wasn't like you.

39:04.778 --> 39:06.712
Wasn't like any politician
I've ever known.

39:06.780 --> 39:08.114
That's right.

39:08.181 --> 39:10.750
She's finally got some teeth.

39:10.817 --> 39:12.018
You listen to me.

39:12.085 --> 39:14.120
If she suffers for this,

39:14.187 --> 39:17.490
I will come after you
with everything I have.

39:17.557 --> 39:19.859
You're threatening me.

39:19.926 --> 39:21.927
I'm warning you, Charles.

39:23.063 --> 39:24.697
Do you need to sit down?

39:24.765 --> 39:27.667
(scoffs) I'm fine.

39:27.734 --> 39:29.502
Well, then, if you don't mind,

39:29.569 --> 39:32.605
Allison will be taking
the podium any second now.

39:32.673 --> 39:34.340
(turns TV on)

39:34.408 --> 39:36.375
Get some rest, Ethan.

39:36.443 --> 39:38.844
You need it.

39:51.224 --> 39:53.893
(Dana gasping)

40:10.944 --> 40:12.878
You told Bauer
you have evidence.

40:12.946 --> 40:15.081
I need to know
where it is.

40:15.148 --> 40:16.649
Come on, Miss Walsh.

40:16.717 --> 40:17.850
You know the deal.

40:17.918 --> 40:19.719
The sooner you tell me,
the easier it'll go.

40:19.786 --> 40:24.390
Please, I have got
nothing to tell you.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.725
There is no evidence.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.827
If that's the way

40:27.894 --> 40:29.829
you want
to play it, fine.

40:32.733 --> 40:35.468
(gasping)

40:35.535 --> 40:39.739
PRESS SECRETARY:
Ladies and gentlemen,
no questions will be taken

40:39.806 --> 40:42.775
until after
this morning's address.

40:43.777 --> 40:45.177
Madam President, I want

40:45.245 --> 40:47.646
to thank you for
your thoughts
on my speech.

40:47.714 --> 40:49.382
They were very helpful.

40:49.449 --> 40:50.750
I'm glad.

40:50.817 --> 40:53.619
My husband would have been
grateful for the support

40:53.687 --> 40:55.788
that you have given me.

40:55.856 --> 40:57.523
Thank you.

40:58.525 --> 41:00.292
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:00.360 --> 41:03.329
the President
of the United States.

41:08.068 --> 41:12.138
My fellow Americans and friends
in foreign lands,

41:12.205 --> 41:15.174
I speak to you this morning
with a heavy heart.

41:15.242 --> 41:19.478
The brutal and cowardly murder
of President Omar Hassan was

41:19.546 --> 41:22.748
a blow to every civilized person
in the world

41:22.816 --> 41:25.384
and a stark reminder
that the pursuit of peace

41:25.452 --> 41:28.254
sometimes comes
with a steep price.

41:28.321 --> 41:32.458
President Hassan understood
that, yet still had

41:32.526 --> 41:37.096
the fortitude to pursue a better
tomorrow against so many odds.

41:37.164 --> 41:41.033
I join with the American people
in mourning him

41:41.101 --> 41:42.701
and every other innocent life

41:42.769 --> 41:45.704
that was lost
during this crisis.

41:45.772 --> 41:47.973
But let it be known here and now

41:48.041 --> 41:53.012
their sacrifice will not have
been in vain.

41:53.079 --> 41:57.183
Peace must and will prevail
no matter the cost.

42:03.390 --> 42:07.760
No matter the cost,
no matter the compromises.

42:07.828 --> 42:11.130
We have waited too long
and worked too hard,

42:11.198 --> 42:13.599
to allow this opportunity
to pass us by.

42:13.667 --> 42:17.403
And that is why in Omar Hassan's
name, I am choosing

42:17.471 --> 42:20.272
to move forward with this
historic summit.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.476
One that was made possible
by the shared hopes and ideals

42:23.543 --> 42:24.844
of the IRK leadership,

42:24.911 --> 42:25.978
(gasping)

42:26.046 --> 42:28.781
and will continue
under its new leader--

42:28.849 --> 42:34.153
a woman of unparalleled courage
and grace,

42:34.221 --> 42:36.355
who has been chosen
by her people

42:36.423 --> 42:39.325
to carry on the mantle
of her late husband...

42:39.392 --> 42:41.694
Dalia Hassan.
