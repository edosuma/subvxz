Having yacht owners and
yacht brokers come on board,

will be a gentle reminder

into the teamwork

26:02.200 --> 26:06.100

I think these are yours.

26:19.233 --> 26:21.166
- This underwear?
I'll say Ross.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.700
- I have no idea whose
those underwear are.

26:22.734 --> 26:24.133
- Put those out.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.767
I mean, there's still
tons of work to do.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.133
The priorities are the guest
cabins and the uniforms.

26:35.033 --> 26:38.266
- The fact that the entire crew
knows we're short-staffed,

26:38.300 --> 26:41.133
hopefully it means
we're more motivated

26:41.166 --> 26:42.300
to help each other out...

26:42.333 --> 26:43.667
It's just us now.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.166
Because we're gonna need

this charter.

35:31.033 --> 35:33.266
- What are we wearing
to the waterfall for lunch?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.600
Leave what we have on?
- Yeah.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.500
- Welcome to the party.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.367
- Need some rugby cleats
on you.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.633
- Oh, wow.

35:46.667 --> 35:50.433
[gentle music]

35:50.467 --> 35:53.033
This waterfall
is breathtaking.

35:53.066 --> 35:55.600
It's moments like this
that make yachting worth it.

35:55.633 --> 35:58.367
It's like...
♪ Ah savenya ♪

35:58.400 --> 36:00.600
♪ Heaven's shining down on me ♪

36:00.633 --> 36:06.667
♪ ♪

36:06.700 --> 36:08.734
- And then I hear my radio.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.567
Okay.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.100
- Adrian, you can go ahead
and prep and get ready.

36:13.133 --> 36:15.066
They'll be coming back
to get you forthwith.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.667
- Copy that.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.367
- Did you water that
down at all?

36:19.400 --> 36:20.367
- Absolutely not.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.667
- Wow, it's really good.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.033
- Yeah, we're gonna have
to be quick with this.

36:23.066 --> 36:24.667
Everything's getting
hot and cold.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.367
- Are we getting the guests
ready to go?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.400
- The guests are kind of
up there vegetating.

36:28.433 --> 36:30.266
- Okay.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.500
What up, homie?

36:35.533 --> 36:37.767
- Hey, it's so stunning.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.500
- I told them
to start bringing the guests

36:39.533 --> 36:41.667
'cause I thought you'd be
set up already.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.500
- Well, that was
a huge mistake.

36:43.533 --> 36:45.533
- 'Cause my food's hot
and the desserts are cold.

36:45.567 --> 36:47.066
- We have the grill.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.767
Can we just reheat the food
and not rush them?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.533
- I mean, I thought
that's why you came early,

36:50.567 --> 36:53.667
that you were
gonna set it up.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.667
Just a little bit further
on the right, left?

36:55.700 --> 36:58.467
- Just follow the sound
of rushing water.

36:58.500 --> 37:02.333
Can't you read French?

37:02.367 --> 37:05.066
- Well, every time we've done
any sort of beach excursion

37:05.100 --> 37:07.600
or anything, everything was
set up every time I got here.

37:07.633 --> 37:10.433
So if it's different,
you just have to let me know.

37:10.467 --> 37:12.133
- This is not--
it has gotta be--

37:12.166 --> 37:16.367
Why is meditation guy the one
having a temper tantrum?

37:16.400 --> 37:17.633
- I'm not psychic, you know.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.367
- Meditate on that.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.667
- I mean, there's no point
in even arguing about it.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.767
- I'm not arguing.
- Let's just do it.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.400
- I'm not arguing.

37:23.433 --> 37:24.734
I'm saying Ross knows
the situation,

37:24.767 --> 37:27.066
so he's probably not gonna
rush them over here.

37:27.100 --> 37:29.500
- Hey.
- There's a bit of a step.

37:29.533 --> 37:30.767
I'll take this one.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.400
- Ross, guests are loaded.

37:33.433 --> 37:35.767
- Can I swap places
with you, love?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.500
[laughs]

37:38.600 --> 37:42.033
- Huh, there's
no gas for it.

37:42.066 --> 37:44.033
Ross, Ross, Adrian.

37:44.066 --> 37:46.100
When you guys
packed the barbecue,

37:46.133 --> 37:48.600
um, there's no bottle
of gas with it,

37:48.633 --> 37:50.500
so I can't do much.

37:50.533 --> 37:53.400
- Copy that, Rhylee, can you
get that on standby, please,

37:53.433 --> 37:54.633
in the beach locker?

37:54.667 --> 37:56.166
- You're looking
for a barbecue?

37:56.200 --> 37:57.734
- We're looking
for a bottle of gas.

37:57.767 --> 37:59.533
Standby on the aft deck
with it.

37:59.567 --> 38:01.367
- Copy that, on my way
to grab one.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.100
- Sorry, guys, we just got
to pick one more thing up.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.500
- Sorry, guys, we've just got

38:10.500 --> 38:12.233
- Sorry, guys, we've just got
to pick one more thing up.

38:13.133 --> 38:13.400
- Not very prepared, are we?

38:13.767 --> 38:14.700
[laughter]

38:14.734 --> 38:16.133
- Standing by on swim deck.

38:16.166 --> 38:17.533
- With yacht brokers on board,

38:17.567 --> 38:19.100
we can't have
mistakes like this.

38:19.133 --> 38:20.667
- What'd y'all forget?
Oh, gas.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.233
- We grabbed two of them,
though.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.033
- Ross, you don't need
the big bottle.

38:24.066 --> 38:25.433
You've got the small bottles.
Go ahead and go.

38:25.467 --> 38:26.667
- Okay, go ahead
and go.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.567
- In yachting, things happen.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.567
All we can do now is damage
control and distraction.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.767
We're all having a good time.
Piña coladas.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.166
- All right, guys,
I'm gonna pick up some speed.

38:43.033 --> 38:44.200
- Copy.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.667
- Oh, my gosh,
I would die.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.233
- Could one of the deckhands
run out front

38:48.266 --> 38:49.233
and give me the bottle of gas?

38:49.266 --> 38:51.633
- Yeah, come here.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.567
- I got the gas.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.700
Over to you.

38:54.734 --> 38:57.066
- [gasps]
Oh, my goodness.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.000
Wow.
- That's amazing.

38:59.033 --> 39:00.667
- Look how nice.
- Beautiful.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.033
- Look at the table,
gorgeous.

39:03.066 --> 39:04.266
- Whoo, not kidding!

39:04.300 --> 39:06.000
- Very nice.
Beautiful setup.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.000
- I have vodka.

39:07.033 --> 39:08.667
I've got wine, champagne.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.133
- Ah, champagne would be great.
- That would be great.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.567
- Okay, cool.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.667
- I've done
a million beach setups

39:13.700 --> 39:16.266
and a million excursions
off the boat,

39:16.300 --> 39:19.667
but nothing
compares to this waterfall.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.734
I feel like I'm in
a Tahitian postcard.

39:22.767 --> 39:25.100
- I can't get over this place.
It's like heaven.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.133
- Get together.

39:26.166 --> 39:27.533
Group shot.

39:27.567 --> 39:29.166
- Totally different
from yachting.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.567
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

39:34.300 --> 39:37.767
- So great.
- It's so beautiful.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.533
- I can get this cleaned up
while it's here

39:39.567 --> 39:41.066
for a little bit
or what's the plan?

39:41.100 --> 39:42.567
- It just needs a good rinse,
that's all.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.667
- Yep.

39:44.700 --> 39:47.166
- So this is tropical
roasted chicken breast

39:47.200 --> 39:49.300
with a sweet pepper dressing.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.166
I made arugula
and mashed salad,

39:51.200 --> 39:54.033
bicolor baby potatoes,
some little snow peas

39:54.066 --> 39:55.567
and zucchini,
garlic-roasted.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.700
Enjoy.
- Thank you.

39:56.734 --> 39:59.200
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.200
- Oh, great.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.033
- Right?

40:07.333 --> 40:09.166
- Did you give them any of the
insect repellant I put in here?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.567
- Oh!
No.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.133
- Ponchos?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.700
- That's all right.

40:15.734 --> 40:17.166
- It's all right,
I'm just not gonna say anything

40:17.200 --> 40:18.633
'cause it doesn't
matter anyway.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.133
- No, it does.
No, no, I forgot.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.266
I had so much going on.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.633
- I can't win with these guys.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.600
- Don't think that I
did that on purpose.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.066
I just--I forgot these.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.700
- No, I know you didn't
do it on purpose.

40:27.734 --> 40:30.066
I just don't know why I even
say anything anymore.

40:30.100 --> 40:31.567
- That's good
that you told me.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.600
I would have taken it
had I remembered.

40:32.633 --> 40:33.633
- I know, good.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.033
- (BLEEP).

40:35.066 --> 40:36.300
- Good job, brother.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.633
- Yay!

40:37.667 --> 40:40.066
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.600
- Are we going
in the waterfall?

40:41.633 --> 40:43.533
- Yes.
- All right, let's do it.

40:43.567 --> 40:44.633
- Whoo-hoo!

40:44.667 --> 40:46.600
Go get 'em.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.667
- Whoo!

40:53.100 --> 40:54.734
- You want me to help you
with anything, Rhy?

40:54.767 --> 40:56.100
- I'm good right now, Ross.

40:56.133 --> 40:57.734
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.633
I'm sorry.

40:59.667 --> 41:02.066
- No worries.
- All right.

41:02.100 --> 41:04.300
- Oh, no!
Oh, my God.

41:04.333 --> 41:07.233
[screaming]

41:07.266 --> 41:08.567
- I want you
to go take a break.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.000
Just take a quick,
like, ten minutes.

41:10.033 --> 41:12.333
- Do I need a break
because you're...

41:12.367 --> 41:14.100
Am I on lates or something?

41:14.133 --> 41:15.633
- Yeah, I know you've
been working hard here,

41:15.667 --> 41:17.200
so I just want you
to take a 20-minute break.

41:17.233 --> 41:18.767
- I said I'm fine.
I've been grabbing water.

41:19.000 --> 41:19.767
There hasn't been anybody
on the boat but me.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.066
Thank you.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.367
- Rhylee, don't get
angry at me.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.700
- I'm not even yelling.

41:23.734 --> 41:25.133
- You act like you're angry.

41:25.166 --> 41:26.734
- I'm not gonna say
a ----ing word

41:26.767 --> 41:28.100
because, honestly, anytime
I say any ----ing word...

41:28.133 --> 41:29.266
- Come on,
speak your mind now.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.133
- Doesn't ----ing matter
what I say.

41:31.166 --> 41:34.000
I'm literally doing exactly
what all of you guys want,

41:34.033 --> 41:36.700
which is put my head down
and be a ----ing day worker.

41:36.734 --> 41:39.600
- With Rhylee, she just
goes to another level,

41:39.633 --> 41:42.367
and it kind of makes
you feel like, you know,

41:42.400 --> 41:43.734
you need to get to this level.

41:43.767 --> 41:44.767
- It doesn't seem
to ----ing matter.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.700
- It does ----ing matter.

41:46.734 --> 41:49.133
I don't want her feeling that
she's not a part of this team,

41:49.166 --> 41:51.266
and I just want to calm
the situation,

41:51.300 --> 41:54.667
but she's ----ing
difficult to deal with.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.300
Look at your smirk
and snarky comment.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.333
I don't need this sh--.

41:57.367 --> 41:58.667
I don't need feedback.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.100
I don't need attitude.

42:00.133 --> 42:03.000
- Then don't ask me
for feedback, got it?

42:03.033 --> 42:04.200
'Cause you literally
just did.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.700
- All right, buddy.
- Yes, sir.

42:05.734 --> 42:07.667
- Listen, I don't need
this attitude from you so...

42:07.700 --> 42:09.200
- Yes, sir.

42:09.233 --> 42:10.400
Good to go.

42:10.433 --> 42:13.700
- Fix that attitude
or ship out, bud.

42:13.734 --> 42:15.300
- Yes, sir.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.166
- ----ing weak.

42:18.233 --> 42:20.333
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:20.367 --> 42:22.367
- The new stew is arriving.

42:23.467 --> 42:24.700
- Nice to meet you,
I'm Laura.

42:24.734 --> 42:26.200
- Laura, my pleasure.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.133
- This new stew is gonna be,
like, a godsend.

42:28.166 --> 42:29.233
- [gasps]
[glass breaking]

42:29.266 --> 42:30.233
- Welcome to the sh-- show.

42:30.266 --> 42:31.700
Get ready.

42:31.734 --> 42:33.300
- Tomorrow I have arranged
for you guys

42:33.333 --> 42:36.033
to go to Le Méridien
on holiday.

42:36.066 --> 42:39.100
- The more I drink, Rhylee gets
a bit more attractive to me.

42:39.133 --> 42:40.266
- [giggles]

42:40.300 --> 42:42.200
- Keep it in your pants,
please.

42:42.233 --> 42:44.233
- Our primary is Brandy Coffee.

42:44.266 --> 42:45.433
- Cheers, everyone.

42:45.467 --> 42:47.300
- All right,
we're out of here.

42:47.333 --> 42:50.400
- (BLEEP), (BLEEP).

42:50.433 --> 42:51.734
- Man overboard.

42:51.767 --> 42:53.000
- Man overboard.

42:53.033 --> 42:54.367
- What?
- What happened?

42:54.400 --> 42:56.166
- Get the life ring!
- Slack out, slack out.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.033
- Ashton's on the line
with the towline.

42:58.066 --> 42:59.166
- Throw it in, he's drowning.

42:59.200 --> 43:01.200
- Take a line.
- [screams]
