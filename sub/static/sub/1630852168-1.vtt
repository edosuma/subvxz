09:53.718 --> 09:56.637
Mm, because Bridgewater, New Hampshire,
population 36,

09:56.721 --> 09:58.848
has a huge buffet of single gay men.

09:58.931 --> 10:03.728
The all-you-can-eat buffet in Los Angeles
has served me nothing but 7 heartbreaks,

10:03.811 --> 10:06.897
a mountain of therapy debt,
and a chipped tooth.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.107
Chipped tooth was your fault.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.485
I was running away from the guy
that faked that he had cancer.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.572
Maybe it's not L.A.
Maybe you choose the wrong guys.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.240
Fine! I'll date no one,

10:16.324 --> 10:19.368
but I'll be close to my family,
I'll open my plant store,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.496
I'll be a guncle,
and a plant lady forever.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.708
[exhales] Actually sounds perfect.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.086
And plants don't cheat. [scoffs]
I think you should come home with me.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.464
We can pretend we fell in love
after all these years.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.840
[laughs]

10:34.508 --> 10:35.926
Wait, hold on.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.889
Hold up. Hold up. Actually, that's good.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.224
-Oh, you're funny.
-It would solve everything.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.311
I can temporarily bury
the pain of my pathetic love life,

10:45.394 --> 10:48.606
while also showing my family
that I'm not a mental case

10:48.689 --> 10:50.900
who has no ability
to be in a relationship.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.235
-By lying to them the whole time.
-Yes!

10:53.319 --> 10:54.904
It'll be so easy.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.114
My family already asks
why we're not just together.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.992
Oh, all straight people ask that
about gay friends.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.120
I mean, besides I stocked up
for my first holiday staycation.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.915
Your first solo holiday staycation.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.584
I love a solo holiday staycation.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.878
You've never done
a solo holiday staycation.

11:10.961 --> 11:14.465
You've always had a boyfriend. Come on.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.510
-Hmm.
-Come home with me.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.179
You don't wanna spend Christmas
all by yourself.

11:20.262 --> 11:24.183
I won't be by myself. I have Emmett,
and an endless stream of TaskRabbit jobs,

11:24.266 --> 11:26.602
which is all about helping people,
which brings me joy.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.021
And if that isn't the
Christmas spirit, I don't know what is.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.357
Nick, I don't want you
to be here all by yourself,

11:31.440 --> 11:34.694
reminiscing about the great Christmases
you had with your mom as a kid.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.823
I know she'll always
be in your heart, but…

11:40.533 --> 11:43.035
you shouldn't be alone
with those feelings at Christmas.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.288
[exhales]

11:47.081 --> 11:49.500
You want me to buy a plane ticket
leaving tomorrow?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.002
I mean,
do you know how expensive that'll be?

11:52.878 --> 11:53.713
Nick!

11:54.213 --> 11:56.173
-[scoffs]
-You have Saving Emmett money.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.508
[groans]

11:58.592 --> 12:00.428
Yes, thank you!

12:00.511 --> 12:03.472
And you'll have even more money
when you finish writing the sequel,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.683
which you really have to start
before you can finish.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.810
Well, what if it's not as good
as the first one?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.646
-Nick, it's a children's book about a dog.
-[groans]

12:11.147 --> 12:14.066
Sorry, Emmett. [chuckles]
I didn't mean it like that.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.318
It's a lot to live up to.
You wrote such a good book.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.113
Because you… [inhales sharply]
…are such a good writer.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.199
So good, that the first book you wrote
became a bestseller,

12:22.283 --> 12:23.659
and now you have all this money

12:23.743 --> 12:25.786
that you're saving
for a rainy day and… [gasps]

12:25.870 --> 12:26.704
…look…

12:28.038 --> 12:29.248
it's pouring.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.043
-All right.
-[gasps] Thank you! Thank you, thank you.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.880
-But we're not doing the boyfriend thing.
-Yeah, we are. [chuckles]

12:35.963 --> 12:38.841
It's the greatest present
I could possibly give my parents.

Change of plans, buddy.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.567
It needs to be a moment
in front of the whole family.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.402
I wanna see everyone's face
when we tell them.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.862
And when will that be?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.656
Everyone's coming over for dinner tonight.
I think we do it then.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.451
-How much does your mom know?
-Nothing yet.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.537
-[Nick] You didn't tell her I'm coming?
-She knows that. She's very excited.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.792
[Nick] She didn't ask why
I'm randomly coming at the last minute?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.585
[Peter] What? No! No.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.629
You're family. You don't need a reason.

Do you think she Googled
"funny, gay Christmas signs?"

13:25.721 --> 13:28.224
Yes, and then she made that
in her crafting room.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.019
-[laughs] What, Sleigh Queen Carole?
-You have to call her Christmas Carole.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.772
She insists on being called
Christmas Carole for all of December.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.691
How did I not know your mom
had a holiday-specific drag name?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.944
Because you've never been here
for Christmas before.

13:40.027 --> 13:40.903

Christmas Carole?

13:58.128 --> 13:59.964
-Saint Nick.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.929
I'm so happy right now.
Do you love my antlers?

-So much!
-[Nick laughs]

14:08.430 --> 14:10.307
-Your dad said they were corny.
-What?

14:10.391 --> 14:11.267
Ah, he's corny.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.227
-They're supposed to be corny.
-Good corny.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.353
Exactly!

14:14.436 --> 14:19.149
You know what, he can freeze his ears off,
but we don't have to because…

14:19.233 --> 14:22.152
-Oh.
-You get a pair and you get a pair.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.238
And you get a pair and you-- Who am I?

14:24.321 --> 14:25.406
-Oprah.
-Oprah.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.200
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course, you guys knew that.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.579
-Come on!
-We'll get our bags. We'll get our bags.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.917
So, Peter, my love, you told Lisa that
you were bringing home a surprise,

14:37.001 --> 14:40.129
and we thought maybe
you were bringing a boyfriend.

14:41.463 --> 14:45.175
But thank God you didn't,
'cause you would have totally ruined it.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.678
-Ruined what?
-Hmm…

14:47.761 --> 14:50.264
I think
Carole has something up her sleeve.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.058
-Christmas Carole.
-Thank you.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.896
[smacks lips] Well,
my early Christmas present for you is…

14:58.272 --> 14:59.565
a blind date.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.276
-[whimpers]
-His name is James.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.905
He's really cute. He's about your age.
I really think you're gonna like him.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.782
No! No, I'm not going on a--

15:08.866 --> 15:12.494
You're not going anywhere
until I get a proper hug.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.079
[chuckling] Hi, Dad.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.166
-Oh, I'm glad you're home, son.
-[Peter] Aw.

15:17.791 --> 15:22.463
-Nicholas, it's always good to see you.
-[chuckling] You too, Harold.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.215
Okay, you can go. Where are you going?

15:25.299 --> 15:27.259
-He's going on a blind date.
-No, I'm not.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.845
-Yes, he is.
-[Peter] No. No, he's not.

15:29.929 --> 15:34.224
How is there even a single,
"single" gay man in this town?

15:34.308 --> 15:37.645
-Why wouldn't there be? You two are here.
-But why is he here?

15:37.728 --> 15:40.731
That’s a great question
for you to ask on your first date!

15:40.814 --> 15:41.690
[chuckles]

15:41.774 --> 15:42.775
I love it.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.318
-[Carole] He loves it.
-You’re going.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.611
-You’re going.
-Nick!

15:47.237 --> 15:48.781
I just wanted to say,

15:48.864 --> 15:53.410
thank you, for allowing me
to do a last-minute Christmas crash. It--

15:53.494 --> 15:55.663
[Harold] Are you kidding? I’m thrilled!

15:55.746 --> 15:59.917
But you're gonna have to excuse me because
we have a leaky pipe in the basement,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.380
and I can’t seem to fix it,
so I'm just gonna have to call a plumber.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.715
Well, why don't you let me try and fix it?

16:06.799 --> 16:11.220
No… No, are you sure?

16:11.303 --> 16:15.140
Oh gosh, I hadn’t thought of that.
Of course, I thought of that,

16:15.224 --> 16:17.810
but Carole said I shouldn't ask you
because you're our guest.

16:17.893 --> 16:18.769
A guest.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
But I hate this plumber.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.023
He overcharges,
and he smells like roast beef.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.316
So, screw him!

16:24.400 --> 16:26.694
We've got our own Handy Bunny right here!

16:26.777 --> 16:28.404
-[titters]
-[chuckles]

16:28.487 --> 16:31.740
TaskRabbit, Dad.
TaskRabbit. He’s a Tasker.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.700
-Rabbit?
-[Peter] Yep.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.786
And I’m a little bit offended. How come
you didn’t ask me to fix your pipe?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.454
-Uh-huh.
-[Carole] Oh well…

16:37.538 --> 16:39.373
-[Peter] Okay.
-Sweetie. [chuckles]

16:39.456 --> 16:43.127
[scoffs] Okay, I didn't wanna fix
your stupid pipe anyway. Go. Go.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.129
-Go help him.
-[Harold] Come on, let's go.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.215
Honey, you’re very talented.
You're good at so many things--

16:48.298 --> 16:50.426
Oh, like, like fixing my poinsettias.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.636
Oh, look how sad they are.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.140
-[scoffs]
-What?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.142
[Peter] Oh…

16:58.934 --> 17:00.894
Go ahead. I'm sure you'll do your magic.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.857
I'll try, but only if you drop
this whole blind-date thing.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.859
No, Peter, come on.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.527
[chuckling] I don't even live here.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.612
I know it,
but wouldn’t it be great if you did?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.906
Okay, so that’s what this is about.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.241
It would be a bonus.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.994
We only get to see
your face once or twice a year.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.081
Yes, which is exactly why I’m here,
to spend time with my family.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.293
Well, and your family really wants you
to have a relationship.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.335
I'm just saying.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.588
[chuckling] Yes, I know!
That’s very clear!

17:30.674 --> 17:33.594
-Why do you avoid love?
-Okay, stop. I don't… I'm not…

17:33.677 --> 17:34.970
I'm not avoiding love.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.931
I'm just avoiding getting
set up on a blind date by…

17:38.015 --> 17:39.641
-Your mother?
-[chuckling] Right.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.061
What's w-- [gasps] You don't trust me?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.271
Not with this, no.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.815
Just because you happen
to meet a gay guy, doesn’t mean

17:46.899 --> 17:48.150
you have to set me up with them.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.277
It doesn't mean that we'd be… You know…

17:50.360 --> 17:54.198
You’ve told me that millions of times
when I've asked why you weren’t with Nick,

17:54.281 --> 17:56.241
but I understand much better now.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.536
I'm reading this great book.
It's called Loving Your LGBTT Child.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.413
[chuckles] I think you mean LGBTQ.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.999
Yeah. Whatever. Do I?
Yeah. Sure, that's it! Yes!

18:04.083 --> 18:04.917
And it's great.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.462
It talks all about gay friendships,
and it says, just what you said,

18:08.545 --> 18:12.591
"Much like a man and a woman don't have
to have a romantic relationship,

18:12.674 --> 18:14.551
a man and man don't have to."

18:14.635 --> 18:16.136
-Exactly.
-Mm.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
But you never know! [clicks tongue]

18:18.514 --> 18:20.891
You know, it's not every day
that you meet a gay handyman.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.893
How did you learn
how to do all this stuff?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.520
[grunts, sighs]

18:24.603 --> 18:26.772
On YouTube and HGTV.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.942
Oh. What is that?
A Homosexual Gay network?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.110
[chuckles] Basically.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.279
Oh. I'll check it out. HGTV.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.406
It's not porn, is it?

18:38.117 --> 18:38.951
Kind of.

18:39.701 --> 18:43.205
But, honey, I really do think
this James guy is great.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.124
He’s a new trainer at my gym.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.377
And he came in,
all the girls went crazy for him.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.504
And then, of course,
he told us he was gay. [chuckles]

18:50.587 --> 18:54.133
Audrey was devastated,
but I thought, "Gay? I know gay."

18:54.216 --> 18:58.345
And so, I told him all about you,
I did, and I showed him your picture,

18:58.428 --> 19:01.765
and he thought you were really cute,
and he would love to meet you.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.934
[sighs deeply]

19:04.518 --> 19:05.811
Show me his picture.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.688
-Really? Okay.
-Yeah.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.399
Wait. Wait, how--
Where would I find a picture?

19:10.482 --> 19:11.650
I don't have a picture of him.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.944
You don't have a picture?
You showed him my picture.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.030
Well, I know, because I have
a hundred pictures of you in my phone.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.866
I don't have any pictures of him.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.201
I just met--
That would be weird. That's creepy.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.078
-[chuckles]
-Oh, maybe he's on Facebook.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.706
Honey, how do I do it?
How do I get into Facebook again?

19:25.789 --> 19:27.958
-Oh my God, Mom.
-Oh wait, there it is. Okay.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.003
Oh, look at that, sweetheart. [chuckles]

19:31.086 --> 19:34.673
Look, it's a canary and a German Shepherd,
and they're besties.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.593
-Look! They're doing the Macarena.
-[Peter] Wow.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.098
I can't believe Christmas Carole
took down all your Britney posters.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.809
I can’t believe you ended
our relationship without consulting me.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.187
Our relationship
hadn’t officially started, so--

19:48.270 --> 19:49.104
[Peter] Yes, it had!

19:49.188 --> 19:52.024
In our agreed-upon fictional backstory,
it absolutely had.

19:52.107 --> 19:57.404
And then you went and endorsed the idea
of me going on a blind date,

19:57.487 --> 19:59.489
as if we were looking for a third.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.450
It’s one date.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.409
Exactly.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.410
It's one date.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.954
One date is not
the same thing as a relationship.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.125
And a blind date
has almost zero chance of working out,

20:10.209 --> 20:13.712
and I’ll still be single,
and it'll somehow all be my fault,

20:13.795 --> 20:17.257
and it's all anybody
will talk about for the entire vacation.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.800
[Peter sighs]

20:19.301 --> 20:22.554
Do you know how excited I was
to bring Tim home to meet my family?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.472
Yes.

20:24.056 --> 20:24.890
I’m sorry.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.226
But look at it this way,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.978
at least you don’t have to call
your mom in a month and explain to her

20:30.062 --> 20:33.190
that the guy that you brought home
for Christmas is, oops, married,

20:33.273 --> 20:34.900
to a woman, with kids.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.986
And now I don’t have to lie
to your family for ten days straight.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.117
-You are the worst fake boyfriend.
-[door closes downstairs]

20:44.201 --> 20:48.705
[Lisa] Don't get too excited!
It's just me, your favorite sister.

20:48.789 --> 20:53.126
Where are you? Get down here.
I need to see your stupid face.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.337
-[chuckling] Hey.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.178
-[Peter] Aw…
[squealing] Uncle Peter.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.055
Hi.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.723
You know what?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.184
I got one of those memory things
on my phone the other day

21:09.268 --> 21:11.520
from that night that you guys
took me out in West Hollywood

21:11.603 --> 21:14.648
and made me get on that bar
with all those shirtless cowboys.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.816
"Made" you. Mm…

21:15.899 --> 21:17.150
-Mom!
-Mom!

21:17.234 --> 21:18.068
What?

21:18.151 --> 21:20.112
[whining] Am I not allowed
to have a good time?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.530
I never get out.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.825
-[scoffs] Lisa, we literally own a bar.
-We own a pub, Tony.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.202
-It's not the same thing. [chuckles]
-[Tony groans]

21:27.286 --> 21:29.746
[Carole] Leese,
I need help with the chicken!

21:32.040 --> 21:33.083
[chuckles] Hi.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.626
-[girl] Hi, Nick.
-Aw…

21:34.710 --> 21:37.879
Bring it in. It's so good to see you.
Merry Christmas.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.381
-Both of you.
-[Nick chuckles]

21:40.465 --> 21:43.343
-Hi.
-They were gay shirtless cowboys, right?

21:43.427 --> 21:44.303
-[Carole] Tony!
-Very.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.555
-Super gay.
-[Carole] Tony, you need to come help me…

21:46.638 --> 21:47.806
Coming, Carole!

21:47.889 --> 21:50.684
Oh! Hi!

21:50.767 --> 21:53.270
-[squeals, laughs]
-Hi! [gasps]

21:53.895 --> 21:54.938
Hi!

21:55.022 --> 21:59.526
Sam, Simon, you both got nine feet taller
than the last time I saw you.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.612
Boys look who else is here!
Do you remember Nick?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.906
Nick is your Uncle Peter’s roommate,

22:04.990 --> 22:07.200
but he also wrote your favorite book

22:07.284 --> 22:09.911
that we used to read
every night before bed.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.914
-Saving Emmett?
-Yes, Saving Emmett!

22:12.998 --> 22:14.541
Is Emmett your real dog?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.376
-Yes, he is.
-So where is he?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.837
He wanted to come,
but he’s afraid of flying

22:18.920 --> 22:21.798
so he’s home in California,
but he’s very happy

22:21.882 --> 22:24.259
because he’s with
all his doggie friends at the hotel.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.636
But what if he thinks you left him forever

22:26.720 --> 22:29.181
like the first people did
before you saved him?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.894
-Okay. Come on, let's say hi to Grandma.
-[whispering] He's so big.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.646
-So, how was the trip?
-It was great! Merry Christmas.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.523
You kids don’t realize
how good you have it.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.151
The first time
Aunt Sandy directed the pageant,

22:41.234 --> 22:42.903
it was totally bonkers.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.280
Okay, Mom, we've heard the story
a million times.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.907
Yeah, okay, well, Nick hasn’t.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.618
So you don’t have to listen,
and you can just sit there.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.453
Anyhoo…

22:51.536 --> 22:53.914
-[all chuckle]
-Aunt Sandy had just moved back here

22:53.997 --> 22:56.375
from New York City,
where she had an acting career.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.753
Well, "career" is generous,
but no, no, go ahead. Go ahead.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.506
-She was in a Broadway show.
-It was Off-Broadway.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.758
It was Little Shop of Horrors, right?
She was Audrey.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.802
She was the understudy to Audrey.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.678
Oh my God, Grandma, I love you.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.263
I cannot tell a lie.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.431
So anyways,

23:11.515 --> 23:15.894
Aunt Sandy made me, and Uncle Peter
and Aunt Ashleigh be in the pageant,

23:15.977 --> 23:19.564
just like she’s making you kids do,
except our script,

23:19.648 --> 23:21.733
Aunt Sandy wrote herself.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.277
It took place backstage at the pageant.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.280
It was like a play within a play.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.366
So,
all four of you kids are in the pageant?

23:29.449 --> 23:31.118
But we need to get out of it.

23:51.221 --> 23:54.141
I was going over
tomorrow’s rehearsal schedule and…

23:54.224 --> 23:56.518
and all of sudden
I got terribly distracted because

23:56.601 --> 24:01.064
out of nowhere Whitney Houston’s
version of "Joy to the World" came on

24:01.148 --> 24:04.025
and that's--
It's the greatest version ever.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.694
I love that version. You bring dessert?

24:05.777 --> 24:09.531
And then I just started singing along,
then all of a sudden, I thought,

Because it's so spectacular.
It's got everything in it.

24:20.208 --> 24:24.004
It's got the King, the Savior,
the Glory, and the Born.

24:24.087 --> 24:24.963
The Born.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.717
I've got so much to do before this show,
but I… I had to come here because

28:52.897 --> 28:55.734
funniest, coolest,
most interesting person who was ever born.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.777
Maybe I am.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.945
-Oh!
-Mm.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.739
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.741
No, I think that was my fault.

29:02.824 --> 29:06.077
And now you know I'm not the coolest,
so we got that out of the way.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.664
[clears throat]
So, um, why are you living in this town?

29:11.499 --> 29:14.335
-Uh, oh, uh--
-Sorry, that sounded…

29:14.419 --> 29:16.296
No! No, that's a fair question.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.798
Last year I got a job
as a ski instructor at Eagle Hill.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.134
Oh, I used to ski Eagle Hill
all the time growing up.

29:21.217 --> 29:25.638
I was teaching there last season and
loved it, because, you know, free skiing.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.726
But I was shuttling back and forth
to Boston weekly for my regular gym job,

29:29.809 --> 29:31.060
and that got old real fast.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.646
So this year I decided to move up
for the season.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.901
Found a sublet, got the job at the
spinning studio, and I ski a lot more.

29:37.984 --> 29:43.239
Wow. A ski instructor and trainer of moms
in a wintry Christmas village.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.491
I love it up here.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.575
But what about…

29:46.451 --> 29:48.077
-Ah, yeah, the, uh…
-[scoffs]

29:48.161 --> 29:50.580
…gay dating app radius is kind of a joke,

29:50.663 --> 29:51.956
especially when it snows.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.833
-It snows all the time.
-All the time.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.339
And magically here you are.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.467
Here I am.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.677
-[coughs]
-Oh! Oh!

30:04.761 --> 30:07.388
-Let me… Let me get you a clean one.
-Oh, thank you.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.891
[Peter clears throat]

30:12.060 --> 30:13.978
Real Christmas trees.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.022
Hmm.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.565
-Flip it around.
-[James] Yeah.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.568
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I got it.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.445
Getting these branches here.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.864
-Okay. That's fine.
-Yeah.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.535
-Did we do it?
-I think we did.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.079
Except you won’t be able to drive.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.748
[chuckles]
Can’t we just pull it back towards us?

30:33.832 --> 30:34.874
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.253
[Peter grunts]

30:38.336 --> 30:40.129
-Oh! Okay.
-Yeah.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.756
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

30:41.840 --> 30:43.299
-Hey!
-Okay.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.846
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

30:48.888 --> 30:50.932
Well, should we ask Mrs. Claus?

30:51.850 --> 30:55.103
Ah, she's busy, and you did tell me
you know what you're doing.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.730
-I said that to impress you.
-[both laugh]

30:57.814 --> 30:58.940
[message alert bleeps]

31:01.526 --> 31:03.069
You got me a down vest.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.112
Merry Christmas.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.113
Thank you.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.866
Aren’t y’all breaking the rules?

31:07.949 --> 31:10.952
I thought the whole point of this
was to keep presents a secret.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.747
Rules are meant to be broken,
especially when it comes to insane rules

31:14.831 --> 31:17.667
that make zero sense. [chuckles]

31:17.750 --> 31:19.627
Why are we all in separate rooms

31:19.711 --> 31:21.963
wrapping our gifts
at the same time at our mother's house?

31:22.046 --> 31:24.757
Because that's what we did
when we were kids.

31:24.841 --> 31:28.303
[chuckles] But now we’re grown-ups
with our own houses,

31:28.386 --> 31:29.971
so you’re wondering,

31:30.054 --> 31:32.432
"Why do they still
have to wrap them here?"

31:32.515 --> 31:34.225
Great question, Nick.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.519
And the non-answer answer
to that is because

31:36.603 --> 31:41.149
this is the "Annual Harrison Family
Secret Wrapping Party,"

31:41.232 --> 31:42.817
courtesy of Christmas Carole.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.777
-[clears throat]
-Do we need wine?

31:44.861 --> 31:46.905
-Yes, wine.
-We definitely do.

31:46.988 --> 31:47.864
Oh, Nick! Nick!

31:47.947 --> 31:50.742
Could you find out
what my mother is getting me?

31:50.825 --> 31:53.036
And if it’s another one
of her stupid signs,

31:53.119 --> 31:55.330
tell her I'd like cash instead.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.331
[Tony chuckles]

31:57.415 --> 31:58.499
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.377
-Hey, Christmas Carole--
-[gasps]

32:01.461 --> 32:03.254
Oh, I think I just peed a little bit.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.464
Oh! [chuckles]

32:04.547 --> 32:06.925
I thought you were Peter.
I’m wrapping his gift!

32:07.008 --> 32:10.345
-Can I see what you’re giving him?
-Yeah, you promise not to tell?

32:11.679 --> 32:12.555
Ta-da!

32:12.639 --> 32:16.142
"Bloom where you are planted." [chuckles]

32:16.225 --> 32:17.727
-[chuckling]
-Oh, I love that.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.062
I know! I love it too.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.105
Oh, do you wanna see
the one I made for Lisa?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.775
-Yes.
-Ready?

32:29.030 --> 32:31.908
You know, she actually, um…

32:32.951 --> 32:35.203
-What, honey?
-She sent me to get wine.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.415
Oh, uh, we're out. I'll go get more.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.626
[Nick] I got you. I just need your car.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.968
[Peter] Well, I think we did it.
Can I give you a ride home?

32:50.051 --> 32:53.096
-You think I’m getting in that death trap?
-[laughs]

32:53.179 --> 32:55.139
I live a block away. I can walk.

32:55.848 --> 32:56.766
But, uh…

32:58.017 --> 32:59.060
I had fun.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.144
So did I.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.188
Yeah.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.192
Bye.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.276
Bye. Careful.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.194
-Oh!
-It's icy.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.240
Sh-- Mm.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.649
-[bottles clink]
-Oh!

33:46.733 --> 33:48.735
-Oh!
-Oh!

33:48.818 --> 33:50.403
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.613
Uh-oh. Is my family
already driving you that crazy?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.198
Not at all. We’re having a blast.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.035
We ran out of wine midway through
your nutty present-wrapping thing.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.537
For which wine is definitely required.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.789
And you? Was the date that bad?

34:02.290 --> 34:06.419
No. No, uh, I just thought that
if I showed up with wine for my mom

34:06.502 --> 34:10.631
it'd soften the blow of the real
Christmas tree I’m also showing up with.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.801
-You got a Christmas tree on your date?
-On the second half of the date.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.887
On the second half of your date?

34:17.221 --> 34:19.807
-That sounds promising.
-It’s not promising.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.560
-It's not promising?
-It’s not, not promising. Shut up!

34:22.643 --> 34:25.354
Well, if you didn’t like him,
you'd be telling me right now.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.316
-But we both know I like the wrong guys.
-So you do like him.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.734
[chuckling] I didn’t

34:29.817 --> 34:31.527
have a bad time.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.531
-Why are you being weird?
-I’m not being weird. You're being weird.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.325
I just-- [chuckles]

34:37.408 --> 34:39.952
I didn't think that
this is what I'd be doing this week.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.412
Yeah, neither did I.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.955
And as your fake boyfriend,

34:43.039 --> 34:45.875
I’m not sure how I feel about you
going on dates with other people.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.585
You asked for it!

34:48.086 --> 34:51.422
Well,
Christmas Carole will be very excited.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.632
-Perfect.
-[gasps]

34:52.715 --> 34:55.009
Shh! I got a new Christmas tree.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.385
-Yay!
-[Peter] Shh!

34:56.469 --> 34:59.055
Nick’s gonna ask dad if we still have
the old Christmas tree stand.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.057
Tony, I need your muscles.
Got a big tree to move.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.976
Leese, distract mom
until we can make the switch.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.231
Mom, I hope you’re sitting down.
I have the craziest story to tell you.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.484
Remember in grade seven
when Troy M. farted on me?

35:11.567 --> 35:13.069
[indistinct chattering]

35:14.112 --> 35:15.488
[Harold] Yeah, it is.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.739
What's going on?

35:16.823 --> 35:18.616
[screaming]

35:18.699 --> 35:20.910
I had to pee! Sorry.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.203
What is happening?

35:22.870 --> 35:24.122
[Peter] This is all me.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.999
I think that Christmas trees
should smell like Christmas trees

35:27.083 --> 35:28.960
and be, you know, green.

35:29.043 --> 35:32.255
I'll take care of everything,
change the water, clean up the needles,

35:32.338 --> 35:36.843
and you should know that I got the tree
on my date with James,

35:36.926 --> 35:38.511
and the date went well.

35:38.594 --> 35:42.223
And… And actually,
James picked the tree out himself.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.641
Oh! [gasps]

35:43.724 --> 35:46.352
Oh, I'm so happy! That is so great!

35:46.435 --> 35:49.188
I can't tell you how happy that makes me!

35:49.272 --> 35:51.107
I think you’re making that pretty clear.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.734
[gasps] And then maybe…
maybe you’ll move home!

35:53.818 --> 35:54.819
[cheering]

35:54.902 --> 35:57.530
All right. Okay. It was one date.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.656
[phone vibrates]

35:59.991 --> 36:00.825
[phone vibrates]

36:03.077 --> 36:04.537
What? It's a text.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.913
Uh, maybe it's him.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.332
It could be anyone. It's probably work.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.668
-[phone vibrates]
-[whispering] Pick it up.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.420
-Well, check.
-[scoffs]

36:13.087 --> 36:13.921
All right.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.218
James wants to know
if I wanna go skiing tomorrow.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.346
[Tony] All right! Yeah.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.433
-[Carole and Lisa squealing]
-[Peter] Okay, okay. All right.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.144
How about we let them celebrate

36:28.227 --> 36:31.606
and you and I will take
this fake tree to the garage, huh?

36:32.523 --> 36:34.483
Yeah. Sure. Let's do it.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.152
[clears throat]

36:40.156 --> 36:42.825
So, what do you think
of this whole blind-date thing?

36:42.909 --> 36:46.162
[scoffs] If Peter's happy, I'm happy.

36:47.163 --> 36:48.789
Hmm. [exhales]

36:48.873 --> 36:51.834
I always thought that
you and Peter should be together.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.588
[chuckles] I think you're angling
for a full-time handyman.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.132
-Well, I wouldn't mind.
-[cupboard door closes]

36:58.216 --> 36:59.050
But, no.

36:59.133 --> 37:03.054
You were the first person Peter introduced
us to that meant anything to him.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.722
You're the only one.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.894
And over the years, I can see that
he's happiest when he's with you.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.481
But you've never seen him
with any of his boyfriends.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.523
No, I haven't.

37:14.607 --> 37:18.945
Probably because none of them
ever lasted that long.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.323
You lasted.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.534
Well, I'm his best friend.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.038
Well, my wife is my best friend
in the whole world. So?

37:29.747 --> 37:33.417
We agree with Grandpa.
We think you and Peter should be together.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.794
[emotional music playing]

37:39.966 --> 37:40.925
[groans]

37:42.718 --> 37:43.636
Oh! [scoffs]

37:44.387 --> 37:46.389
[scoffs] I can't wear this.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.099
-Bro.
-Exactly. [chuckles]

37:48.182 --> 37:50.559
From when you went skiing
with your girlfriend in high school?

37:50.643 --> 37:54.397
Last time I wore this,
I was… [inhales sharply] …17 years old.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.691
So, yes, it's a sign. I'm not going.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.902
I don't need to leave you alone again
all day with my family, anyway.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.363
Why not? I love being with your family.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.366
I told your sister I'd take all the kids
to the pageant rehearsal.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.285
[chuckles] You did?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.913
I love my family too, and you've spent
more time with them than I have.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.456
You'll have plenty of time with them.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.792
Plus, you like this guy.
Plus, you already said yes.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.627
I'm not opposed to ghosting.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.796
I know. Maybe that's part of your problem.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.506
Maybe you're part of my problem.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.883
You know what, I actually dig the outfit.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.385
It's a good story.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.804
If he doesn't like you because of
a throwback fashion moment,

38:26.887 --> 38:28.472
then he isn't for you anyway.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.599
And, you don't have to go out
with him again.

38:31.142 --> 38:31.976
Well…

38:33.144 --> 38:34.353
-See?
-[exhales]

38:39.984 --> 38:41.027
[bells chiming]

38:42.236 --> 38:45.948
"Mary worried what the angel meant
by the greeting."

38:46.032 --> 38:50.536
"Seeing she was scared, the angel said…"

38:50.619 --> 38:53.164
"Don't be afraid, Mary. God is--"

38:53.247 --> 38:54.582
Wait. Wait.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.375
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

38:57.293 --> 39:01.756
I don't know what you're doing here,
but I need to see you scared.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.343
And see, that way, he can see your fear
and then his line works.

39:05.426 --> 39:08.888
Aunt Sandy, I don't know what to do.
So, why don't you just show me? [chuckles]

39:08.971 --> 39:10.348
[screams]

39:10.431 --> 39:11.265
[gasps]

39:11.349 --> 39:12.725
[indistinct chattering]

39:12.808 --> 39:15.269
Try that. All right, now take note.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.855
-[exhales]
-Can you believe this insanity?

39:18.439 --> 39:20.816
Looks like Aunt Sandy needs some help.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.276
No one's listening!

39:22.360 --> 39:23.486
Listen!

39:23.569 --> 39:24.737
Listen!

39:24.820 --> 39:25.946
Listen!

39:27.156 --> 39:29.658
I didn't wanna mention punishment,

39:30.159 --> 39:33.537
but I'm telling you,
I can be really scary.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.582
-Can you write me a doctor's note?
-[indistinct chattering]

39:37.333 --> 39:38.459
I'm not a doctor.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.795
So? You just have to write the note,

39:40.878 --> 39:43.422
and you and I can go rescue Peter
from his date.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.424
How do you know he wants to be rescued?

39:45.508 --> 39:47.510
He doesn't realize it yet,

39:47.593 --> 39:48.886
but once you show up,

39:48.969 --> 39:52.306
he'll realize that you're the one
he wanted to be with all along.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.810
-[chattering continues]
-No, no. I can't. I'll lose it!

39:55.893 --> 39:58.813
Do you all wanna see me lose it?

39:58.896 --> 40:02.650
-What are you getting him for Christmas?
-Don't you have to be up there?

40:02.733 --> 40:06.153
-[sighs] I'm after this.
-[Sandy] We're gonna take it from the top.

40:06.987 --> 40:07.822
I'm the donkey.

40:07.905 --> 40:12.118
"Our story begins
with a young woman in her home…

40:13.702 --> 40:15.121
Mary."

40:22.128 --> 40:24.630
[dramatically] "Unless you look deeper,

40:26.132 --> 40:32.596
there's nothing
particularly remarkable about Mary."

40:33.889 --> 40:35.683
[giggles]

40:35.766 --> 40:37.143
That's my favorite part.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.521
[Peter] So, my best friend, Nick,
came home with me,

40:40.604 --> 40:44.567
and the whole plan was that we were
going to pretend we finally fell in love.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.944
-Why?
-Because…

40:47.027 --> 40:48.863
[exhales] …my family is terrified

40:48.946 --> 40:51.365
that I'll be alone forever,
and I didn't want to hear about it.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.701
But that's really cool
of your friend, though,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.619
I mean, to play along
with the whole charade.

40:55.703 --> 40:58.330
That kind of thing comes easily to us.
It's how we met, actually.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.959
-How'd you meet?
-Nine years ago, I had just moved to L.A.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.044
Uh, it was literally my second day in tow,

41:04.128 --> 41:08.549
and I was doing what every gay guy does
on his second day in a new city.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.759
-Joining a gym.
-Correct.

41:10.843 --> 41:15.431
And Nick was also there
doing the exact same thing.

41:15.514 --> 41:19.518
He had also just moved to L.A.,
but we didn't know any of this yet.

41:19.602 --> 41:24.064
And then I heard that the couple
ahead of us was getting a family discount.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.691
-Wow.
-We didn't have to say a word.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.736
When it was our turn,
we improvised the whole thing.

41:28.819 --> 41:33.032
We were from Chicago.
We'd been together for three years.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.826
We were engaged,
but we didn't have the rings yet.

41:35.910 --> 41:40.915
We'd just driven all the way to L.A.
with Chelsea, our African gray parrot.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.167
I mean… We got the family discount.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.921
-That's an amazing story.
-We've been best friends ever since.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.798
Have, uh, you and Nick ever…

41:49.882 --> 41:50.716
No.

41:51.675 --> 41:52.510
No.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.056
[girl] Danny's right.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.642
You can't just not get
Uncle Peter a present for Christmas.

41:59.725 --> 42:01.227
He's not my boyfriend.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.812
So? He's not my boyfriend either.
I'm still getting him a gift.

42:03.896 --> 42:05.523
Wait, you are? What are you getting him?

42:05.606 --> 42:09.568
Mom's just putting our name on something.
But, Nick, you have to get him something.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.238
Look, I appreciate what you're--

42:13.155 --> 42:16.742
whatever you're trying to do,
but Peter and I have a long history.

42:16.825 --> 42:20.204
We've never gotten each other
Christmas presents. We've never…

42:20.287 --> 42:21.830
actually done Christmas together.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.582
-Aw.
-Aw.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.417
-Let's get a photo.
-Yeah.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.380
-[Sandy] I want to see all of your acting…
-[exhales]

42:29.463 --> 42:31.090
-[camera clicks]
-Can you do a funny one?

42:33.175 --> 42:34.051
[camera clicking]

42:34.134 --> 42:37.972
Oh! My nieces with Nick right now.

42:38.764 --> 42:39.640
Oh…

42:40.766 --> 42:41.725
You have FOMO.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.269
[chuckling] I do.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.271
I'm a FOMO-sexual.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.272
[laughs]

42:46.772 --> 42:48.983
I mean, obviously,
I wanna be here with you…

42:50.067 --> 42:52.152
but I don't get to see
my family very often.

42:52.236 --> 42:55.281
-Oh, I hope I'm not causing any drama.
-No. Quite the opposite.

42:55.364 --> 42:58.117
Everyone… Everyone's very happy I'm here.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.869
Part of it is that
they want me to move back home.

43:00.953 --> 43:03.122
Oh! Do you ever think about that?

43:03.205 --> 43:04.164
All the time.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.376
But then…

43:07.459 --> 43:12.006
Work-wise, New Hampshire is not exactly
the social media capital of the world.

43:12.506 --> 43:14.842
Oh well, I wouldn't miss my job that much.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.511
Because your real passion is plants?

43:17.595 --> 43:19.013
How'd you know about that?

43:19.096 --> 43:23.601
You don't think I found you on Instagram
@MrHausPlant? H-A-U-S?

43:23.684 --> 43:24.893
That's not fair.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.814
My mom didn't have any pictures of you.
I couldn't find you anywhere on Instagram.

43:28.897 --> 43:32.735
@SkisTheLimit. S-K-I-S.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.028
Oh. Uh-huh.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.905
Ski's the limit. Yeah.
I get it. I like it.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.033
[ski lift clatters]

43:41.952 --> 43:44.413
[Nick] "It was Emmett's third day
in the shelter."

43:44.496 --> 43:45.623
"He was trying to sleep

43:45.706 --> 43:47.625
so he didn't have to
think about being sad,

43:47.708 --> 43:50.002
but he was so sad."

43:50.085 --> 43:52.421
"Then, all the other dogs started barking,

43:52.504 --> 43:55.466
which meant a human was
there to save one lucky dog."

43:55.549 --> 43:58.302
"But, Emmett didn't bark.
He just wanted to sleep."

43:58.385 --> 44:02.640
Am I right or am I right, huh?
Uncle Peter insists on a real tree.

44:02.723 --> 44:06.060
He says he's gonna deal with it.
And here we are, hanging ornaments

44:06.143 --> 44:09.647
-for the second time and cleaning up.
-[whirring]

44:10.189 --> 44:13.567
Well, he would be here if he wasn't with
the guy you set him up with.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.818
[vacuum stops]

44:14.902 --> 44:17.738
Yeah, you're right, honey.
I just wanted to complain. [chuckles]

44:17.821 --> 44:19.573
I get that. [chuckles]

44:19.657 --> 44:23.327
Why isn't he back yet?
I'm just gonna text him at this point.

44:23.410 --> 44:25.704
-No. No, no, no. No, no, don't text him.
-[whirring]

44:25.788 --> 44:27.581
-Leave him alone.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

44:28.290 --> 44:31.085
[Nick] "So, Emmett sat
in the truck next to the man,

44:31.168 --> 44:36.340
and they drove
and drove and drove." [chuckles]

44:36.423 --> 44:38.550
"Now, when they walked
into the man's apartment,

44:38.634 --> 44:40.844
the man said, 'We're home!'"

44:40.928 --> 44:44.431
-Is that your real apartment?
-It's a drawing of it, yeah.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.517
Where you live with Uncle Peter?

44:46.600 --> 44:47.476
Yep.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.229
Then why isn't Uncle Peter in the book?

44:50.854 --> 44:52.106
It's a good question.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.858
When did you and Uncle Peter get married?

44:54.942 --> 44:57.152
[girls laughing]

44:57.236 --> 44:59.905
[laughs] We're not married, no.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.365
What are you, then?

45:03.242 --> 45:06.328
-[Nick clears throat]
-Hey, you should totally write a sequel.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.331
Well, have you been talking
to my publisher?

45:09.415 --> 45:11.667
-You wrote it already?
-No.

45:11.750 --> 45:12.876
-Oh.
-But I will.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.087
-Mm-hmm.
-As soon as I figure out a good story.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.841
I know. It should be
about Emmett at the hotel.

45:18.924 --> 45:21.343
During Christmas like he is right now.

45:21.427 --> 45:24.221
It should be sad at first
because you're leaving him,

45:24.304 --> 45:26.640
but then it's happy
when you come and pick him up.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.017
Right. And Uncle Peter
would pick him up with you.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.520
-Do you guys wanna write the book?
-Oh no, I don't.

45:31.603 --> 45:33.480
Okay, look, come on.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.773
[boys laughing]

45:35.733 --> 45:38.277
-[Peter] That was great.
-[James] You killed that last run.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.779
[Peter scoffs] Only after you showed me
what I was doing wrong.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.114
Well, it is kind of my job.

45:42.197 --> 45:45.242
Don't think I didn't realize
I got a free private lesson.

45:47.327 --> 45:50.164
I just hope you don't feel like
you were working all day.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.714
Not at all.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.219
Should we, uh, après-ski?

46:04.303 --> 46:06.221
-We should après-ski.
-[phone vibrates]

46:06.764 --> 46:09.516
Sorry. Sorry. I-- [sighs]

46:14.021 --> 46:14.855
[chuckles]

46:17.399 --> 46:18.400
Actually…

46:19.359 --> 46:20.569
Am I that bad a kisser?

46:21.737 --> 46:23.030
-Horrible.
-[chuckles]

46:23.113 --> 46:24.698
I wasn't gonna say anything.

46:25.324 --> 46:28.494
-Thanks for understanding.
-Of course. Family comes first.

46:28.577 --> 46:31.747
And, uh, you can just, uh,
Venmo me for the private lesson.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.290
[laughs]

46:34.249 --> 46:36.043
-Oh.
-[laughs]

46:41.632 --> 46:44.426
-I had a really great time today.
-Me too.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.680
-[engine starts]
-[door shuts]

46:57.981 --> 47:00.859
-Hey!
-Damn! Wow! You scared me.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.362
So? How'd it go?

47:03.445 --> 47:04.780
It was…

47:06.073 --> 47:07.741
kind of great. [chuckles]

47:07.825 --> 47:09.034
Okay!

47:09.117 --> 47:10.077
Yes!

47:10.160 --> 47:11.703
Uh, details?

47:13.789 --> 47:16.875
[Danny] It’s so obvious.
How come only Grandpa sees what we see?

47:16.959 --> 47:18.544
All you gotta do is look at their faces.

47:18.627 --> 47:19.503
It’s pure love.

47:19.586 --> 47:22.047
I know, but why don’t even they see it,
is the question.

47:22.130 --> 47:22.965
Love is blind.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.676
No. No, that’s when you fall in love
with someone who’s ugly.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.054
-[indistinct chattering]
-Why are you looking out of the window?

47:29.137 --> 47:33.141
Just two people who look at each other
like that are not just friends.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.768
You’re totally right.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.647
Oh, you’re all insane.
Peter just went skiing with James.

47:38.730 --> 47:41.525
He's just probably
telling Nick how great it was.

47:42.484 --> 47:44.987
-What's happening?
-No, no, no, no!

47:47.573 --> 47:49.741
[Tony] Aw. Is one of them proposing?

47:49.825 --> 47:52.619
Maybe Nicholas actually listened to me.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.081
What do you mean?

47:56.582 --> 47:57.833
What did you tell him?

47:58.709 --> 48:01.461
Sounds like a solid, amazing date.

48:01.545 --> 48:03.338
Except I was gone all day.

48:03.422 --> 48:06.091
Well, you were skiing.
It’s kind of an all-day thing.

48:06.174 --> 48:09.428
-Yeah, but it’s already dark out.
-It’s dark because it’s winter.

48:10.095 --> 48:11.930
I know. [chuckles, exhales]

48:12.014 --> 48:13.473
I just wanted to be here too.

48:13.557 --> 48:17.060
-Because you were feeling FOMO-sexual?
-Yes! I was.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.186
[chuckles]

48:18.270 --> 48:21.273
I only have so much time here and…
I don’t like that.

48:22.357 --> 48:24.943
I wanna be able to go on a date
and be in a relationship,

48:25.027 --> 48:28.864
and also go to Lisa’s house for dinner
at the drop of a hat,

48:28.947 --> 48:32.451
or go to a movie with my dad,
or take the girls shopping or…

48:33.493 --> 48:36.288
I don’t know,
Coach Simon’s Little League team.

48:36.371 --> 48:37.456
Mm.

48:37.539 --> 48:39.791
Right. I’m obviously
never coaching a Little League team.

48:39.875 --> 48:43.253
But I don’t want it to be
this one-or-the-other thing

48:43.337 --> 48:44.755
for the rest of my life.

48:45.297 --> 48:48.592
Well, it doesn’t have to be,
but you’d have to move back here.

48:48.675 --> 48:52.512
That’s what I’m saying.
I think I do wanna move back here.

48:57.976 --> 49:00.479
Oh. [chuckles nervously]

49:03.106 --> 49:07.069
So, you really must like this guy
if he’s got you thinking about all this.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.446
Yeah, I don’t know.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.282
It is two dates. [chuckles]

49:13.116 --> 49:15.452
I think he’s just the straw
that broke the camel’s back.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.913
Please, just listen to me.

49:17.996 --> 49:20.666
Mom, you’re just pushing this James guy
because you set them up.

49:20.749 --> 49:22.709
You have to look
at what’s really happening here.

49:22.793 --> 49:23.877
No, you do.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.088
Listen, I totally get it.

49:26.171 --> 49:28.590
For years I've been pressuring Peter
to be with Nick.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.676
They’re so close and so great together,

49:30.759 --> 49:33.679
but that doesn’t mean
they have romantic chemistry.

49:33.762 --> 49:37.683
This is a common misconception
we straight people have about gay people.

49:37.766 --> 49:41.395
But then I read my book called
Loving Your LGBTTT Child.

49:41.478 --> 49:42.896
Okay, I'm not buying it.

49:42.980 --> 49:46.149
Nick and Peter wanna make out.
They should make out.

49:46.233 --> 49:50.278
Nick is hot. Nick is a ten.
And Peter’s a ten in New Hampshire.

49:50.862 --> 49:54.116
We just have to make sure Peter doesn’t go
on any more dates with this James guy.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.910
-Yes!
-You can’t just decide what Peter does.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.204
Okay,
sometimes people need a little shove.

49:59.287 --> 50:00.330
It's true. It's true.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.540
Jim and I wouldn’t be married

50:01.623 --> 50:04.710
unless Lisa had forced me
to reply to his message on Match.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.378
What? You weren’t gonna reply?

50:06.920 --> 50:07.963
-You’re welcome.
-[chuckles]

50:08.046 --> 50:12.426
And that's exactly what we need to do,
is force them to spend more time together.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.553
They’re roommates and best friends.
How much more time

50:14.636 --> 50:15.679
should they spend together?

50:15.762 --> 50:18.640
Okay, but time here, in a new environment.

50:18.724 --> 50:21.226
It’s Christmas. It’s romantic.

50:21.309 --> 50:23.186
You know,
it’s not their normal day-to-day.

50:24.396 --> 50:27.024
And when I think about it,
what do I actually have in L.A.?

50:27.107 --> 50:28.692
A… A… A job I don’t love,

50:28.775 --> 50:30.902
an overpriced apartment,
an overpriced car.

50:31.903 --> 50:36.491
There are people that I like in L.A.,
but you’re the only person I love.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.495
Well, I would, uh…

50:43.165 --> 50:44.124
really miss you.

50:46.334 --> 50:48.086
[car approaching]

50:50.422 --> 50:51.840
[Sandy] Thanks, Trish!

50:54.593 --> 50:56.011
-[car door closes]
-[groans]

50:57.345 --> 50:59.473
Aunt Sandy? You okay?

51:01.600 --> 51:02.434
Yeah.

51:02.517 --> 51:03.810
-Okay.
-[mumbling softly]

51:03.894 --> 51:06.396
Oh, whoa. Here, let me-- I… got you. Okay.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.940
Aunt Sandy, what's wrong?

51:09.858 --> 51:12.027
"All the world’s a stage."

51:12.652 --> 51:16.656
"And most of us are desperately
under-rehearsed."

51:17.199 --> 51:19.493
-Mm.
-Who said that?

51:20.368 --> 51:21.787
It wasn't Shakespeare.

51:21.870 --> 51:22.704
Who?

51:24.164 --> 51:27.000
-I can’t remember. That’s why I asked.
-Oh.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.503
[Sandy] It could've been Captain Kangaroo.

51:29.586 --> 51:30.921
He was smart.

51:31.671 --> 51:33.423
I don't think
we should all meddle like this.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.258
From the Queen of Meddling!

51:35.342 --> 51:39.513
No! I don't want any part of it.
Whatever makes my Peter happy, right?

51:39.596 --> 51:42.140
-[Harold] That's it. You're right.
-[girls] Amazing! Us too.

51:42.224 --> 51:43.725
[giggling, chattering]

51:45.352 --> 51:47.187
Meddle, meddle, meddle, meddle.
King of meddle.

51:47.270 --> 51:50.357
Well, I'm glad you’re all
having so much fun,

51:50.857 --> 51:53.235
but I just thought everyone should know

51:54.069 --> 51:59.032
that the pageant is
a giant load of crap on a stick.

51:59.825 --> 52:02.661
And not in a good way,
if you know what I mean.

52:02.744 --> 52:03.662
[sighs]

52:05.163 --> 52:06.373
What's the good way?

52:06.873 --> 52:09.626
[Sandy] I don't know. It's worse
than crap on the floor.

52:10.836 --> 52:15.465
Okay, seriously, Nick and Peter need
to help Aunt Sandy with the pageant.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.925
-Yes!
-Wait!

52:17.008 --> 52:19.594
Are you insinuating
that just because Nick and Peter are gay,

52:19.678 --> 52:21.012
that they know theater?

52:21.096 --> 52:23.557
Because that’s another misconception
I read about in my book.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.560
No, Mom. What I’m saying is
Peter is really creative

52:26.643 --> 52:30.313
and he puts together, like,
productions and photo shoots all the time.

52:30.397 --> 52:33.150
And Nick is super handy,
and he can build things like sets,

52:33.233 --> 52:37.279
and the whole point of this is
to force them to do more things together.

52:37.779 --> 52:41.491
Oh, Aunt Sand. Aunt Sand.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.702
Let Peter and Nick help you.

52:43.785 --> 52:47.164
You shouldn’t have to do this
all by yourself. You know?

52:47.247 --> 52:50.500
Jesus H. Christ.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.836
I know. I know.

52:52.919 --> 52:55.547
No, that’s the title of my play.

52:56.256 --> 52:57.132
Oh…

52:57.924 --> 53:01.136
It’s just such a huge undertaking.

53:01.219 --> 53:05.140
If Peter and Nick would like
to give me some help, that would be great.

53:05.223 --> 53:08.852
It's not because the gays know theater.

53:09.853 --> 53:15.317
It's because the gays just know
how to do stuff, you know?

53:15.984 --> 53:17.652
I mean, they’re survivors.

53:19.613 --> 53:23.992
And for some reason,
they’re always obsessed with me.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.037
-[exhales]
-[chuckles]

53:27.120 --> 53:28.205
I don't know why…

53:30.373 --> 53:31.416
but I like it.

53:34.711 --> 53:36.922
I’m not saying it’s definite. [exhales]

53:37.005 --> 53:38.173
I’m just feeling…

53:39.257 --> 53:40.967
-[exhales]
-A lot of things.

53:41.509 --> 53:42.928
-[exhales]
-[chuckles]

53:43.637 --> 53:44.763
[huffs, sniffs]

53:46.306 --> 53:47.807
-All right.
-[sniffs]

53:48.892 --> 53:50.185
-Here.
-[chuckles]

53:50.727 --> 53:52.687
-Oh, well…
-[mellow music playing]

53:56.441 --> 53:57.734
Now you'll be cold.

53:59.319 --> 54:00.403
We can go inside.

54:02.197 --> 54:03.031
I'm done.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.158
Done with what?

54:07.244 --> 54:08.078
Come here.

54:15.418 --> 54:16.836
[Peter chuckling] Oh!

54:16.920 --> 54:18.004
[whispering] Wow!

54:22.467 --> 54:23.426
Thank you…

54:24.552 --> 54:25.387
for this,

54:25.887 --> 54:29.182
for being so great with my family…

54:31.476 --> 54:32.310
for…

54:34.437 --> 54:35.272
you.

54:36.648 --> 54:37.482
[chuckles]

54:38.566 --> 54:39.651
[inhales deeply]

54:53.873 --> 54:58.795
[stomping foot]
Help. My wife is about to have a baby.

54:59.546 --> 55:00.839
My rooms are full.

55:00.922 --> 55:03.758
All I can offer is my stable
where we keep our animals.

55:03.842 --> 55:05.468
At last, I can have… I can have--

55:05.552 --> 55:07.679
Stop! Stop!
You’re reading from your scripts!

55:08.596 --> 55:10.724
I was very clear about this.

55:10.807 --> 55:15.270
I said, "Everybody needs to be off book,
or I'm gonna be doing their dialogue."

55:16.021 --> 55:17.772
And I'm gonna have to do just that.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.816
None of you have any lines.

55:19.899 --> 55:23.570
None of you. None of you.
None of you. None of you.

55:32.787 --> 55:39.210
"Joseph and Mary knocked on every door
in Bethlehem looking for a place to stay."

55:39.294 --> 55:46.009
"They nearly gave up
and then they tried one last place."

55:50.805 --> 55:53.224
Help! Help, please.

55:53.308 --> 55:55.852
My wife, she's having a baby.

55:56.603 --> 55:59.773
"Are you kidding me? My rooms are full."

55:59.856 --> 56:03.610
"All I have is my stable
where we keep my animals."

56:04.110 --> 56:05.028
[panting]

56:05.111 --> 56:08.698
Thank you so much, sir,
we… we really thank you. We'll take it.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.116
Oh my God!

56:10.200 --> 56:12.744
[crying, moaning]

56:12.827 --> 56:17.957
I have to have this baby.
Please, give me some privacy!

56:19.918 --> 56:21.002
That's how it's done.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.380
[grunts] Aunt Sandy.

56:24.130 --> 56:26.674
Can I have a word with you?
Just a quick word?

56:28.218 --> 56:30.929
I just want you to know that,
you calling me over here

56:31.554 --> 56:33.306
and I’m in the middle
of directing a scene,

56:33.390 --> 56:35.767
it makes me look like
I don’t know what I’m doing.

56:36.434 --> 56:38.478
Sorry. I didn't… I didn't mean to do that.

56:38.561 --> 56:43.483
I just thought that maybe, I had, um,
maybe Nick and I could help you here.

56:43.566 --> 56:45.485
Oh, yeah? What do you got?

58:25.376 --> 58:26.878
Wait, are you serious?

58:27.378 --> 58:28.421
No!

58:29.088 --> 58:31.049
They can't just-- No.

58:31.799 --> 58:33.051
Tell them that--

58:34.135 --> 58:36.763
Offices are closed.
Everyone's away, including me.

58:36.846 --> 58:38.139
I’m in New Hampshire.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.517
Even if I was in L.A.,
there's absolutely no--

58:40.600 --> 58:41.601
Agh!

58:42.310 --> 58:45.897
Three months of work and they want me
to deliver a new campaign in one day.

58:45.980 --> 58:47.982
Huh, what was wrong with the first one?

58:48.066 --> 58:51.361
Nothing! But suddenly the CEO decided
he doesn’t want to use influencers.

58:51.444 --> 58:54.948
He wants to use "real" people.
Which still means models, by the way.

58:55.031 --> 58:57.450
All the agencies are closed.
My photographers aren't available.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.410

59:11.464 --> 59:13.383
Oh, you're very funny.

59:13.466 --> 59:17.762
No, you’re real. You could be a model.
You’re a ten! He's a ten!

59:18.721 --> 59:20.932
No! I mean, I'm sorry.

59:21.015 --> 59:23.601
I have something
to do that needs to be done.

59:23.685 --> 59:26.938
So I'm gonna go do it. So it's done. Okay.

59:27.647 --> 59:29.232
[exhales] Hmm?

59:29.315 --> 59:31.317
Thanks, Dad. Great idea.

Good idea. One of your best."

I know who you are,
and I see what you're doing.

You're pretending like you’re helping
your son solve a work problem,

59:46.124 --> 59:50.753
but really, you’re manufacturing some sort
of a romantic thing between them?

59:50.837 --> 59:54.132
I was doing both.
I was helping and manufacturing.

-Good! Oh, that's good.
-I can’t believe you’re making me do this.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:04.225
Okay, this will work.
Can you look… Can you look at me though?

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:07.562
Oh! Very good.
I think that's your new author photo.

1:00:07.645 --> 1:00:09.772
-Now you just have to write a book.
-Oh, you're funny.

-Can you up look at me?
-[shutter clicking]

1:00:11.983 --> 1:00:13.234
Okay, one more.

-Oh.
-[whispering] Oh, that feels wrong.

Oh. Oh, smolder.

Okay, take off the jacket
and the gloves and the… and the shirt.

1:00:23.661 --> 1:00:26.748
Pick up a piece of wood.
Not that one. Here. Like a round one.

1:00:33.546 --> 1:00:34.589
You're horrible.

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:40.345
You need a little bit more…
Hold this for me.

1:00:40.970 --> 1:00:42.597
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.682
Oh my God! [laughs]

1:00:44.766 --> 1:00:45.808
I'm sorry.

1:00:46.392 --> 1:00:47.935
Oh yes!

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:49.562
Come on, give me a big smile.

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.564
-Okay. Here. It's stupid.
-Okay.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:54.817
-I shouldn't even be in this campaign.
-No, I like this, but you know what?

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:57.737
Oh, you just look so cute.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.907
Yes, yes, do you wanna lean
your head up against the tree?

1:01:00.990 --> 1:01:02.241
Oh, there we go.

1:01:04.702 --> 1:01:07.205
Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Now put it on.

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:11.501
-Make sure you don't get any…
-There you are. This is really cute.

1:01:11.584 --> 1:01:13.753
-I have an idea I wanna do.
-Like what?

1:01:13.836 --> 1:01:16.130
-I want you to look right into the camera.
-Mm-hmm.

1:01:16.214 --> 1:01:19.884
On three, breathe out
so I can see the fog on your breath.

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:21.260
Okay. Ready?

1:01:21.761 --> 1:01:22.595
Okay.

1:01:23.262 --> 1:01:24.097
One,

1:01:24.597 --> 1:01:25.431
two,

1:01:26.182 --> 1:01:27.517
-three.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.143
[gentle piano music plays]

1:01:35.566 --> 1:01:37.610
[inhales shakily]

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:39.612
-[phone vibrates]
-[chuckles]

1:01:41.614 --> 1:01:43.366
-Oh.
-What? Work? Let me guess.

1:01:43.449 --> 1:01:46.577
They've changed their minds again,
and now they want girls.

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:49.414
But real girls. With their boyfriends.

1:01:49.497 --> 1:01:51.958
It’s James. He wants to grab a drink.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:52.875
Ooh.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:54.544
But I’m not going.

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:56.462
I, ugh, have all this work drama

1:01:56.546 --> 1:01:59.215
and I don’t need to spend
any more time away from my family.

1:02:00.049 --> 1:02:00.967
Right?

1:02:02.176 --> 1:02:05.304
Well, you have been
with the family all day.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:07.557
And we might have just solved
your work problem.

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:10.184
So… I think you should probably go.

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:16.232
-You should come with.
-No. I don’t need to be a third wheel.

1:02:16.315 --> 1:02:18.109
-You wouldn’t be.
-I literally would be.

1:02:18.192 --> 1:02:21.487
-[scoffs] Why do you want me to go?
-Because I think you wanna go.

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:24.657
-I think you want me to wanna go.
-I think you’re overthinking it.

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:26.242
Just go.

1:02:29.454 --> 1:02:30.496
Okay. I'll go.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:32.290
-All right.
-[delivery notification bleeps]

1:02:33.207 --> 1:02:34.959
[mellow music playing]

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:35.918
I'm going.

1:02:39.172 --> 1:02:40.173
[music continues]

1:02:45.386 --> 1:02:46.471
[message chimes]

1:03:03.696 --> 1:03:04.697
[groans]

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:09.494
Black and gray doesn't scream
very donkey to me.

1:03:09.577 --> 1:03:11.496
-Well, I just--
-No.

1:03:12.371 --> 1:03:13.498
No?

1:03:13.581 --> 1:03:16.375
Where are you going? We need help.
I have to figure out my Mary makeup.

1:03:16.459 --> 1:03:18.085
I need to show you the new donkey costume.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:19.212
I’m on the fence about it.

1:03:19.295 --> 1:03:23.257
I’m actually off to do a TaskRabbit gig.
Peter left to grab a drink with James.

1:03:23.341 --> 1:03:26.469
-No, he didn't. What?
-Where? Mom and Dad’s bar?

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:27.512
No idea.

1:03:27.595 --> 1:03:31.474
Well, it’s the only bar in town.
Nick, you need to stop this.

1:03:32.683 --> 1:03:33.559
[chuckles]

1:03:34.143 --> 1:03:35.895
[footsteps receding]

1:03:36.604 --> 1:03:37.688
[phone ringing]

1:03:37.772 --> 1:03:38.815
Lisa’s Crisis.

1:03:38.898 --> 1:03:41.651
It’s us. Is Peter there
with that guy grandma set him up with?

1:03:41.734 --> 1:03:44.904
They're here. And it's not good.
James is super-hot.

1:03:44.987 --> 1:03:47.740
Oh my God, I hate James so much.

1:03:47.824 --> 1:03:50.576
Mom, you and Dad need to ruin this date.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:53.538
Just spill their drinks on them.
Oh, tell lies about Peter.

1:03:53.621 --> 1:03:55.498
Just do whatever you need
to get rid of this guy.

1:03:55.581 --> 1:03:56.749
-Yeah, yeah.
-On it.

1:03:58.209 --> 1:03:59.210
Give me a burger!

1:03:59.293 --> 1:04:02.839
We need to find Nick and make him do
something about his feelings.

1:04:02.922 --> 1:04:05.550
He went to that TaskRabbit gig.
We have no idea where he is.

1:04:05.633 --> 1:04:07.343
He was walking. He can’t be that far.

1:04:08.719 --> 1:04:12.473
Nick's basically been on his own
since he was 17, so…

1:04:12.557 --> 1:04:14.308
he just had to do everything.

1:04:14.392 --> 1:04:17.603
He basically built the whole set
for the pageant in a day and a half.

1:04:19.313 --> 1:04:21.357
You know, you talk about Nick a lot.

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:25.069
Oh, well, you know… [scoffs]

1:04:25.152 --> 1:04:26.404
He’s my best friend.

1:04:26.487 --> 1:04:29.282
No, it’s sweet. If I had a best friend
who could fix anything,

1:04:29.365 --> 1:04:31.075
I’d be bragging about him too. [chuckles]

1:04:31.158 --> 1:04:31.993
You’re lucky.

1:04:32.535 --> 1:04:33.411
[chuckles]

1:04:34.787 --> 1:04:35.621
Yeah.

1:04:36.539 --> 1:04:37.498
I guess I am lucky.

1:04:37.582 --> 1:04:38.583
[clears throat]

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:43.588
-Oh! Oh my God!
-Oh!

1:04:43.671 --> 1:04:44.797
Peter!

1:04:44.881 --> 1:04:49.343
-Wh-- What? How is that my fault?
-Oh, you weren't looking.

1:04:49.427 --> 1:04:51.220
I am so sorry.

1:04:51.304 --> 1:04:54.265
I mean, this is typical Peter, you know,
in his own world,

1:04:54.348 --> 1:04:58.477
just thinking about himself,
not about anyone or anything around him.

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:00.479
-[stammers]
-[Lisa] Here's a napkin.

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:04.191
Seriously, when I was 11 years old,
he ran over my science project

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:07.486
with his remote-control
Barbie Baywatch Rescue Cruiser.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:09.488
Oh my God! And the worst part was that

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:12.867
I had actually figured out how to stop
the polar ice caps from melting,

1:05:12.950 --> 1:05:15.161
but I couldn't remember
how I figured it out.

1:05:15.244 --> 1:05:19.707
And now we have climate change
because of Peter. Honestly, just-- Oh!

1:05:19.790 --> 1:05:21.876
I can't even with you.

1:05:21.959 --> 1:05:24.795
It's just… He's so selfish.

1:05:24.879 --> 1:05:26.339
[groans]

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:28.758
-[Danny] Nick!
-[groans]

1:05:31.594 --> 1:05:34.430
Admit you’re in love with Peter
or we’re not putting the ladder back.

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:37.391
-You’ve gotta be kidding me.
-Does it look like we’re kidding you?

1:05:37.475 --> 1:05:41.437
[sighs] We've talked about this.
Peter and I are just friends.

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:42.521
You guys are more!

1:05:42.605 --> 1:05:46.275
And we think you know it,
but you’re not doing anything about it.

1:05:46.359 --> 1:05:47.360
[chuckles]

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:50.112
I know you care,
but this not the-- Okay, wait!

1:05:52.406 --> 1:05:53.240
[exhales]

1:05:54.492 --> 1:05:55.743
[emotional music playing]

1:05:56.243 --> 1:05:57.244
I do love Peter.

1:05:58.704 --> 1:05:59.538
You're right.

1:06:00.247 --> 1:06:02.375
You mean you’re in love with Peter.

1:06:03.417 --> 1:06:04.961
Right. Yes.

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:09.548
-I can’t believe I’m saying this out loud.
-So you're gonna do something about it?

1:06:09.632 --> 1:06:13.094
I would if the feeling was mutual,
which I don’t think it is,

1:06:13.177 --> 1:06:16.013
considering Peter is currently
on a third date with someone else.

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:17.139
[door creaks open]

1:06:18.557 --> 1:06:19.475
[man coughs]

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:21.227
Um, ladies… [chuckles]

1:06:21.310 --> 1:06:23.688
…I would like to keep
my five-star rating, please.

1:06:28.943 --> 1:06:31.028
Your family obviously cares
a great deal about you.

1:06:31.112 --> 1:06:34.532
-[chuckling] Sometimes too much so.
-What do you mean?

1:06:34.615 --> 1:06:37.702
Well, this may be weird to tell you, but,

1:06:38.494 --> 1:06:43.624
um, my family has always had this thing
where they think that Nick and I

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:45.334
are supposed to be together,

1:06:46.502 --> 1:06:52.717
which is weird because here I am
on an actual date, a third date with you.

1:06:54.468 --> 1:06:55.928
Maybe they’re onto something.

1:06:56.971 --> 1:06:59.724
What if you and Nick have
an undeniable connection

1:06:59.807 --> 1:07:01.934
that everybody can see but you?

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:05.354
Don't you have one of those friends
everyone assumes is your boyfriend?

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:06.814
Hmm.

1:07:08.024 --> 1:07:08.858
No.

1:07:09.984 --> 1:07:11.694
Oh. [inhales]

1:07:11.777 --> 1:07:13.195
-[phone vibrates]
-[exhales]

1:07:13.279 --> 1:07:14.405
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1:07:17.491 --> 1:07:18.617
[Peter] It's my boss.

1:07:28.878 --> 1:07:32.006
This is random, but you wouldn't be
interested in being in a Raazr ad

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:34.800
for Instagram if they pick you, would you?

1:07:34.884 --> 1:07:37.011
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah, I'm sorry, that's…

1:07:37.094 --> 1:07:38.637
-Yes!
-Oh.

1:07:38.721 --> 1:07:40.431
-Yeah.
-Okay! [laughs]

1:07:41.390 --> 1:07:44.101
It will be fun. Um, um, I just need--

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:46.896
-Yeah, so… I need something from…
-Yeah.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:50.316
Okay.

1:07:57.239 --> 1:07:58.115
-Great!
-Yeah.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:07:59.200
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1:08:00.409 --> 1:08:01.660
[laughs]

1:08:02.328 --> 1:08:03.746
This is great.

1:08:03.829 --> 1:08:04.663
I wanna do one more.

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:05.956
Look right into the camera

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.709
and on three breathe out,
so I can see your breath. Okay?

1:08:08.793 --> 1:08:10.503
-Okay.
-Ready? Here we go.

1:08:11.128 --> 1:08:14.006
One, two, three.

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:19.845
It's great.

1:08:21.555 --> 1:08:22.431
Really good.

1:08:23.432 --> 1:08:25.643
Well, you're a lifesaver. [chuckles]

1:08:25.726 --> 1:08:27.061
It was a lot of fun.

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:28.938
[keys jingle]

1:08:29.021 --> 1:08:30.481
-Well, this is me.
-Oh.

1:08:32.775 --> 1:08:33.859
Do you wanna come up?

1:08:34.860 --> 1:08:36.612
Uh, sure.

1:08:38.823 --> 1:08:39.657
Actually…

1:08:42.034 --> 1:08:44.161
[clicks tongue] I should probably go home.

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:47.373
The girls need me for the pageant and…

1:08:47.456 --> 1:08:49.041
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:52.169
I look forward to seeing it.

1:08:53.587 --> 1:08:55.506
That is, if I'm invited?

1:08:55.589 --> 1:08:58.175
Yeah. Yeah, of course you’re invited.

1:08:58.259 --> 1:09:00.970
-I’ll make sure there's a ticket for you.
-Great. [exhales]

1:09:01.053 --> 1:09:02.972
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

1:09:03.055 --> 1:09:04.390
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

1:09:04.473 --> 1:09:05.474
[keys jingle]

1:09:16.235 --> 1:09:17.153
[exhales]

1:09:23.742 --> 1:09:25.870
What the? [scoffs]

1:09:26.453 --> 1:09:27.288
Really?

1:09:28.455 --> 1:09:29.957
[sighs deeply]

1:09:40.009 --> 1:09:41.010
Don't snore.

1:09:43.345 --> 1:09:44.513
[breathing heavily]

1:09:51.103 --> 1:09:52.438
-Hey.
-Hey, sorry.

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:56.525
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:09:56.609 --> 1:09:57.443
The…

1:09:58.152 --> 1:10:00.154
-The girls are in my bed.
-[chuckles]

1:10:01.071 --> 1:10:02.406
Of course, they are.

1:10:04.366 --> 1:10:06.619
-Of course, they are.
-[chuckles]

1:10:06.702 --> 1:10:08.204
[emotional music playing]

1:10:13.459 --> 1:10:14.460
[Nick groans softly]

1:10:20.007 --> 1:10:20.883
[both sigh]

1:10:29.016 --> 1:10:32.269
-[Lisa] Absolutely not.
-[Danny] You don't know what looks good.

1:10:32.353 --> 1:10:33.646
Well, I know what looks bad!

1:10:33.729 --> 1:10:37.942
You know what? Let me…Let me just say,
it's… it's a little bit too sexy.

1:10:38.025 --> 1:10:39.944
[sister] And sexy is a great thing.

1:10:40.027 --> 1:10:42.404
It is a great thing
when you're my age. Not now.

1:10:42.488 --> 1:10:44.823
[sister] Peter and Nick said
we look amazing.

1:10:44.907 --> 1:10:46.116
No, we didn’t.

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:51.914
Ho, ho, ho! [blows raspberry, chuckles]

1:10:51.997 --> 1:10:53.916
Can you do something about this?

1:10:53.999 --> 1:10:56.085
-Okay. Yes.
-[door opens]

1:10:56.877 --> 1:11:00.381
All right!
Are we late for the final rehearsal?

1:11:02.967 --> 1:11:05.302
Okay! Let's go! Let's go.

1:11:05.386 --> 1:11:07.012
-I wanna stay.
-[Ashleigh] I know.

1:11:07.096 --> 1:11:09.723
-[Simon] Why can't we stay in the kitchen?
-[Ashleigh] Mommy says so.

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:12.518
-Use your words, honey.
-I have no words. There are no words.

1:11:12.601 --> 1:11:14.311
You should've had boys.

1:11:14.395 --> 1:11:16.480
Why couldn't we stay in the kitchen?

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:18.691
Oh, you know, because it’s Christmas Eve,

1:11:18.774 --> 1:11:22.194
which means that someone
needs to change Grandma’s sign.

1:11:22.278 --> 1:11:23.112
Me! Me!

1:11:23.195 --> 1:11:26.156
Okay! Well, up we go! [grunts]

1:11:27.491 --> 1:11:30.953
One more day to go. [sighs]

1:11:31.036 --> 1:11:35.040
Hey, Ash, uh, can we use
some of your farm makeup for the show?

1:11:35.124 --> 1:11:39.128
To make the girls look like,
you know, not terrifying.

1:11:39.211 --> 1:11:43.424
Of course. Yeah, and would you maybe
take some pics and post them?

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:46.176
-Absolutely.
-#FarmOnMyFace.

1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:47.970
Ha-- Yeah.

1:11:49.096 --> 1:11:49.930
[squeals]

1:11:50.014 --> 1:11:52.850
[Peter] Yes! Yes, ladies.

1:11:52.933 --> 1:11:56.020
Oh, such an improvement.
Take it from your guncle.
