22:27.288 --> 22:28.588
What's that, Fatty?

22:29.891 --> 22:35.995
You remind me of a gorilla
I saw once in a traveling circus.

22:36.031 --> 22:38.664
Only the gorilla had better breeding.

22:39.401 --> 22:43.284
You'd be wise to mind your hole
or I'm liable to give y'another.

22:43.772 --> 22:47.573
I'd wager your mother dropped
you on your head more than once

22:47.609 --> 22:48.975
when you were a baby.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.678
Whiskey fingers, as you
well know, can be slippery.

22:53.982 --> 22:55.815
You're nothin' but a
bloated old Mary-Ann.

22:55.850 --> 22:57.784
I should kill you right here and now!

22:59.017 --> 23:00.383
You're an idiot!

23:00.755 --> 23:03.523
A useless, pathetic, idiot.

23:03.558 --> 23:05.625
If you don't shut your hole,

23:06.594 --> 23:09.829
you'll be shittin' your death shit
right here in this murky drink...

23:27.449 --> 23:29.749
Some privacy, please?

23:35.023 --> 23:36.255
Oh.

23:40.595 --> 23:43.162
I think I've a notion of who
you're wantin' for this.

24:01.683 --> 24:04.650
I've not seen my cousin anywhere
since this whole thing started.

24:07.922 --> 24:09.889
Pains me to say it,

24:13.595 --> 24:16.696
but that's what I'm figurin'.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.831
Your own blood.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.868
He's killed Delaney.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.972
He'll kill Durant, too.

24:29.878 --> 24:31.744
We both know what he's capable of.

24:32.547 --> 24:34.347
You saw him take out a man's eye.

24:34.382 --> 24:35.681
I did.

24:40.889 --> 24:43.322
Johnny's never been a very patient man.

24:48.296 --> 24:52.131
You best get that ransom together quick.

25:01.609 --> 25:02.842
Lads.

25:39.647 --> 25:41.547
Campbell thinks it was you behind this.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.084
What in hell made him think that?

25:45.119 --> 25:47.820
Well, we needed a credible threat
for Durant, so I told him.

25:49.390 --> 25:52.925
It's over, John, and so is our
time in this godforsaken country.

25:52.961 --> 25:56.195
- We'll take the money and we'll go home.
- Ireland?

25:57.332 --> 25:58.931
Are you off your head?

25:59.434 --> 26:01.901
It's like I fell asleep on
a train four years ago.

26:03.338 --> 26:06.572
I had a brother, a family...

26:06.608 --> 26:07.840
Dreams of gold.

26:08.543 --> 26:11.277
But it's like I've
woken up, I'm alone...

26:11.312 --> 26:12.645
(SIGHS)

26:12.680 --> 26:13.946
In hell.

26:14.682 --> 26:17.702
You're not alone, sure. You've got me.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.720
America's an awful bitch.
I'm done with it.

26:21.189 --> 26:23.089
Would you listen to yourself?

26:23.124 --> 26:25.024
You're a big man here.

26:25.059 --> 26:27.526
You have whores, cash.
You have a saloon.

26:27.562 --> 26:30.062
You've a stake in a railroad,
for Christ's sake.

26:30.898 --> 26:34.600
There's nothing back home but
bleedin' famine and Englishmen.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.838
At least we can breathe there.

26:38.873 --> 26:42.575
And with the money from this
job, John, we could run things.

26:51.219 --> 26:52.885
(SPITS)

26:52.920 --> 26:54.453

27:08.169 --> 27:10.069
They're gonna pay.

27:10.104 --> 27:11.570
Of course they'll pay.

27:13.007 --> 27:16.702
We can't have the country's
most consequential businessman

27:16.727 --> 27:17.975
taken by bandits.

27:19.514 --> 27:21.213
And they'll keep quiet about it.

27:22.617 --> 27:24.250
It's the American Way!

27:26.888 --> 27:28.254
Aye.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.757
It must be exhausting,
being so consequential.

27:41.430 --> 27:43.197
CAMPBELL: Make the drop. But
not until Thomas Durant

27:43.298 --> 27:44.694
has been handed over to your custody.

27:44.719 --> 27:45.751
Understood.

27:45.787 --> 27:48.521
Major Bendix and his men
will finish with Mr. Shea.

27:51.059 --> 27:53.626
Maggie... A word.

27:53.661 --> 27:55.394
You're too late, Miss Ellison.

27:55.997 --> 27:59.131
Johnny Shea killed Mr. Delaney
and kidnapped Durant.

27:59.167 --> 28:00.600
McGinnes turned him in.

28:01.069 --> 28:02.068
Why?

28:02.403 --> 28:04.871
No loyalty amongst rats.

28:07.809 --> 28:09.275
Maggie,

28:10.478 --> 28:13.579
Durant told you he wired for
money to pay off the ranchers?

28:13.615 --> 28:14.747
Yes.

28:17.051 --> 28:19.678
I've been through the books.
There's no wire.

28:19.888 --> 28:22.922
- He sold his personal stock.
- No, he didn't.

28:26.394 --> 28:27.526
He's broke.

28:31.499 --> 28:33.613
Ransom yourself.

28:34.969 --> 28:37.937
- That's one way to solve that problem.
- A man was killed.

28:39.407 --> 28:42.842
- Your friend, murdered.
- Yes, and I wasn't.

28:46.180 --> 28:47.813
I'm not lucky to be alive.

28:48.249 --> 28:52.852
I think Shea was told not to kill me
on that train by Thomas Durant.

28:52.887 --> 28:56.989
What you are suggesting is beyond absurd.
This isn't a dime novel.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.061
You don't know what happened
on that train, Louise.

29:02.096 --> 29:03.863
You were there but you don't know.

29:04.198 --> 29:07.942
I'm telling you, Maggie.
Shea was following orders.

29:09.337 --> 29:14.064
Unpack that cash.
I'll squander neither money nor lives.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.642
- We wait.
- Your waiting is gonna get him killed.

29:16.678 --> 29:19.045
- We only have a few hours before...
- Listen to me...

29:19.080 --> 29:22.048
Miss Ellison may just be right.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.984
Durant is just the kind of
man to do such a thing,

29:25.019 --> 29:27.253
arrange his own kidnapping.

29:28.823 --> 29:32.325
- No.
- If she's wrong, if we're wrong...

29:32.360 --> 29:34.527
Durant's no worse off than he is now.

29:34.562 --> 29:39.465
If we're right, won't be long before
he waltzes through that door.

29:40.702 --> 29:43.001
Of course, he'll have to stand trial

29:43.026 --> 29:46.608
for what
befell his chief engineer on that train.

29:54.749 --> 29:55.915
Fine.

30:00.455 --> 30:02.088
Do what you want.

30:07.729 --> 30:09.161
Bring me Mickey McGinnes.

30:28.716 --> 30:32.084
DURANT: John Campbell is not
going to let the murderer

30:32.120 --> 30:35.421
of the chief engineer of the
Union Pacific railroad go free.

30:36.491 --> 30:39.158
He will hunt your cousin
down until he finds him.

30:39.193 --> 30:41.694
And when he finds him... (INHALES)

30:41.729 --> 30:46.132
Do you think we can rely
on that thing up there?

30:50.238 --> 30:54.540
It would be prudent to tie things off.

30:55.610 --> 30:57.209
No loose ends.

30:59.847 --> 31:01.414
You're absolutely right.

31:02.617 --> 31:04.717
That would be the prudent thing to do.

31:05.787 --> 31:10.756
So when these bastards get here,
and drop that money off,

31:10.792 --> 31:15.361
that thing up there and
me are gonna take it

31:15.396 --> 31:17.396

a damn thing you can do about it,

were worth saving.

31:55.336 --> 31:57.036

32:00.408 --> 32:01.707
Come on.

32:22.330 --> 32:25.325
There's $50,000 in there.
You just take it and go.

32:29.103 --> 32:31.437
Look, we need to take this money
and get the hell out of here. Now.

32:31.472 --> 32:33.939
Take the damn money.
Take it and get of here.

32:33.975 --> 32:37.243
$250,000. Not 50.

32:37.278 --> 32:38.310
It's not enough.

32:38.346 --> 32:39.645
It's enough for the life that we want.

Enough for the life you want, maybe.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.472
I was meeting a man out at
