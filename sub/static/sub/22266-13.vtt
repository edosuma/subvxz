You would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive that remains

00:07.925 --> 00:09.006
in my possession.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.209
What do you want?

00:11.303 --> 00:12.714
Vengeance for my son.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.135
- What'd you find?
- Video of his son's murder.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.137
This is fabricated. It didn't happen.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.391
Whoever planned this
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.187
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.263
Do you trust me?

00:26.401 --> 00:28.814
I need you here for a
rather important assignment.

- Rooting out a traitor.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.753
All right. Keep moving.

I guess Cayden James and friends
knew we were coming.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.760

00:59.184 --> 01:01.471
<i>Once I learned of Mr. Sobel's treachery,</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:04.430
<i>I had to assume
this location was compromised.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:07.147
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

01:07.526 --> 01:10.985
<i>I didn't appreciate your alliance
with him.</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:14.610
<i>Made me think we no longer have
an understanding.</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:18.034
- You need to know something.
<i>- Many things, I'm sure.</i>

01:18.370 --> 01:22.114
<i>But I doubt very much that
you're the man to teach them to me.</i>

01:22.457 --> 01:24.995
We almost have proof
that I didn't kill your son.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.997
<i>A desperate gambit.</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:29.124
Cayden, give me more time.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.915
<i>Time, I'm afraid,</i>

<i>Mr. Sobel's betrayal convinced me

01:41.977 --> 01:43.388
<i>Accordingly,</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:46.475
<i>I will be detonating

02:08.836 --> 02:09.997
Where are we with the video?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.421
Well, we're running
a photographic analysis algorithm

02:12.507 --> 02:13.793
to reveal the original footage.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.004
- How long will that take?
- As long as it takes.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.380
The algorithm Felicity and Curtis wrote

02:17.471 --> 02:18.461
works wonders on a still image

02:18.555 --> 02:20.091
but this is 24 fps video
we're talking about here, so...

02:20.265 --> 02:22.552
Right. Cayden just told us that
we're running out of time.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.179
There's something you should consider.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.683
You're putting all of your chips down
on a bet that he'll spare this city

02:27.773 --> 02:29.560
if he thinks you're not responsible
for his son's death.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.892
That's because that's
the only play we have, Alena.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.153
I'm just saying you might be
trying to reason with a man

02:35.238 --> 02:36.274
who's beyond reason.

CAYDEN: As you are well aware,
Arclight is now in its final phase.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.492
And now it's time for us
to take our leave.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.871
Words much appreciated.
But how are we to get out of city?

02:49.795 --> 02:51.536
Stay close to your phones.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.460
You'll be airlifted from the city
before the bomb goes off.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.208
After it does,

02:57.302 --> 03:00.921
your individual shares of the ransom
will be wired into offshore accounts

03:01.014 --> 03:02.721

03:02.891 --> 03:04.052
Sounds fair.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.425
Lucrative.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.556
CAYDEN: Indeed.

to see this project to fruition.

Oliver didn't kill your son.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.787
Which means someone else did.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.001
GREEN ARROW:
The assassin's name is Carl Iskoff.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.505
He was instructed
to use a bow and arrow,

11:14.716 --> 11:18.505
so the video could be manipulated,
and they could make it look like me.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.089
It's the same tech used to out Oliver
as the Green Arrow, four months ago.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.685
Someone's gone through a lot of work
to put you two on a collision course.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.520
Oh, yes.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.526
Someone within my organization.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.859
How do you know?

11:36.946 --> 11:39.984
The metadata on the forged video file

11:40.700 --> 11:42.783
confirms it as the
work of the same person

11:42.869 --> 11:45.202
who manipulated that photo in October.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.741
You lost a man a month ago.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.374
Killed by the traitorous Mr. Sobel,
but I highly doubt it was Mr. Sheck.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.253
- That leaves Laurel? Diaz?
- And Anatoly?

11:54.672 --> 11:57.210
I'd like to speak
to my former colleagues.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.342
And that's where the two of you come in.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.544
GREEN ARROW: No.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.051
We're not rounding
them up to be executed.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.058
No, I just want a pointed conversation.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.681
Bring them to me. All three. Alive.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.264
Otherwise, I'll have no choice
but to stay the course.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.816
I still have a very powerful bomb.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.607
And I'd be perfectly happy
to take out Star City

12:18.696 --> 12:22.189
right along with whoever orchestrated
the death of my son.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.918
You gotta be kidding me.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.461
Please tell me you're kidding me.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.254
The only way to stop James
from destroying the city

12:38.341 --> 12:39.707
is by delivering him these people.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.167
Lead them to the slaughter, you mean.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.004
- We won't let that happen.
- Right now, that's our only option.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.679
You don't even know for sure
that one of them did it.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.097
I mean, none of them
were working for Cayden

12:47.183 --> 12:48.173
when he received the video.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.934
They were working for him
when he received the doctored photo.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.636
It has to be one of those people, Alena.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.064
It is either Diaz,
Anatoly or Black Siren.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.233
You hope. What if Cayden is lying?

12:58.403 --> 12:59.439
Well, we've got
bigger problems then that.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.192
I mean, what makes you think that
we can find Cayden's BFFs,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.272
if he can't?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.153
If they're smart,
they're out of the city by now.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.109
They're smart, but so is he.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.786
He grouped them together by promising
to fly them out before the blast.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.911
FELICITY: Thank goodness for small
favors and gullible bad guys.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.994
By now, they're worried that James
might not make good on that promise.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.333
Raisa wanted to go
to one of the city shelters,

13:18.631 --> 13:20.293
so she could be with her family.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.625
What's going on? Why do we have
to leave the safe house?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.710
We'll talk about it later, buddy.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.591
You promised
you won't lie to me anymore.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.926
Cayden James is threatening
to detonate a large bomb

13:32.020 --> 13:33.010
in Star City

13:33.354 --> 13:35.016
and this is the safest place for you.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.764
That is the truth.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.851
- Alena.
- ALENA: Yeah. We're running facial recog

13:40.945 --> 13:42.231
and Cayden gave us
back satellite control.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.858
Our usual tricks aren't working.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.941
Oliver, we need the rest of the team.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.067
Agreed.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.663
- Where are you going?
- Need to go look for a few people.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.740
Let me come with you.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.244
I need you to stay here.

13:58.963 --> 13:59.953
I wanna stay with you.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.914
It is too dangerous out there.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.290
Bottom line.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.759
I'll be back as soon as I can be.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.009
You have any luck?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.348
Did you think I would?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.056
She was pretty clear about
where she stood, hoss.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.353
So, basically the city
is gonna get destroyed

14:20.443 --> 14:21.729
and our friend is gonna commit murder

14:21.819 --> 14:23.230
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about either?

Sorry, John.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.495
We've gotten some
place with Cayden James.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.165
He won't detonate his bomb, if we
bring back Anatoly, Diaz and Laurel.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.287
Alive.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.210
So, no honor amongst thieves?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.916
Well, let's just say
he has a good reason

14:42.006 --> 14:44.623
to think at least one of those
is responsible for his son's death.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.668
We can use your help finding them.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.924
If we do it,
we should go after Laurel first.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.347
Dinah's after her.
If she gets to her before we do...

14:52.433 --> 14:53.423
D's gonna kill her.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.968
And if she does that,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.519
she might be killing the whole city.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.531
Vince told me
you had a to-go bag stashed.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.958

16:32.408 --> 16:34.400
He wants Anatoly, Diaz and Laurel.

- Alive.
- Or boom goes the city.

If A.R.G.U.S. has your scent,

isn't the best idea.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.947
- William, just listen to me...
- It's just like on the island.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.121
Just like when my mom died.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.534
I don't wanna lose you too.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.669
- Please, I want to stay with you.
- Come here. Come here.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.705
It's all right.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.841
You stay right here.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.637
It started with my son.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.133
Yours should be here for the end.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.386
It's a beautiful symmetry,
don't you think?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.602
He has nothing to do with this.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.853
I don't disagree.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.027
But it appears your son has other plans.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.228
Hello, William.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.902
My name is Cayden James.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.321
You're the guy who wants
to blow up the city.

23:32.703 --> 23:33.693
I suppose.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.777
It's a long story.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.948
And it concerns my own son.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.449
Where is he?

23:40.669 --> 23:41.659
Passed away, I'm afraid.

23:53.474 --> 23:54.635
MAN: <i>Cayden James.</i>

23:59.063 --> 24:00.725
I was told to expect you.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.769
Warned, in fact.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.850
Mr. James, we're here to remand you
into custody

24:05.945 --> 24:07.937
for multiple violations of federal law.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.862
I strongly advise you not to resist.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.617
My only son is playing in this game.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.614
Could I perhaps watch it
before you take me in?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.114
That's not how it works.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.789
Just asking for few moments.
Little compassion here.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.002
I strongly suggest
surrendering peacefully

24:28.300 --> 24:29.290
to avoid a scene.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.001
There's no need for that.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.943
I'm gonna get a lay of the land.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.745
She better be here when I get back.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.368
I don't think she likes me.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.829
Well, you haven't given her
much reason to, have you?

25:08.257 --> 25:09.247
Fair.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.876
(BLACK SIREN GRUNTS)

25:15.973 --> 25:16.963
She's right, you know.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.513
- (CLEARS THROAT) About what?
- I'm not like Sobel.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.301
I'm not gonna change.

25:22.396 --> 25:26.015
I'm not gonna just wake up one day
and... And be your Laurel.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.020
No, no. You'll always be you.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.353
But you can be better.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.526
(SCOFFS) Why would I?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.111
We live in an ugly world

25:36.201 --> 25:39.820
and the only way to survive it is...
Is to be ugly right back.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.905
- You're wrong, okay?
- Hey.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.833
Has it ever occurred to you
that I like who I am?

25:45.085 --> 25:48.044
That when I killed Sobel,
I actually enjoyed it?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.884
And all those pictures that you
showed me of your daughter, this...

25:54.386 --> 25:56.844
This... This woman
that I don't even recognize,

25:57.681 --> 25:58.797
they made me sick.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.347
She was soft and naive.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.520
And that's why she's the one who's dead.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.347
Why are you telling me this?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.189
Because I don't ever wanna
find myself enjoying killing you.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.146
Perimeter's secure.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.823
- Let's move.
- Yeah.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.497
Quite a brave young fellow
you have here, Mr. Queen.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.451
Brave and foolish.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.671
- Much like his father.
- Wait, wait. What's he doing here?

26:31.757 --> 26:33.589
None of your concern, Mr. Lance.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.126
Ah. And the rest of our guests
have arrived.

26:36.553 --> 26:41.298
These two freaks say that you think
one of us killed your boy?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.932
In point of fact, Mr. Diaz,

26:43.519 --> 26:45.135
I know that one of you killed my boy.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.970
I intend to find out who.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.097
You believe people in masks,

26:50.109 --> 26:51.771
over people you do business with?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.101
DIAZ: I'm with the Russian.

26:54.238 --> 26:57.402
I think these guys would do anything
to save their precious city.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.449
I don't trust anyone's word, Mr. Diaz.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.577
I put my faith in data.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.199
Information.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.577
Ones and zeros never lie.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.664
This is digital proof that
one of you has betrayed me.

27:13.674 --> 27:16.291
Come on, William.
Please just get out of there.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.004
None of you know

27:19.596 --> 27:21.428
what it feels like to lose a son.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.598
A piece of yourself, gone.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.220
It's like a phantom limb.
No. It's worse than that.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.056
It's like a piece of your soul, lost.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.649
As if it had never been there. No. Stop.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.897
I keep reminding myself that...

27:36.446 --> 27:38.563
I have not lost my son.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.487
He's been taken from me.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.567
DIAZ: Hey.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.824
You're losing it.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.697
Your grief,

27:48.542 --> 27:50.078
it's making you crazy.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.463
What if it has?

27:56.633 --> 27:59.341
Just look at him. He wants to kill
everyone in this room.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.845
- Just be ready to move.
- Okay. Screw this.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.130
It was me.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.674
I did it.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.551
Surprise.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.354
I'm the one who did it.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.182
I killed your stupid kid.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.814
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.570
For the past three minutes,

28:19.656 --> 28:22.069
Cayden's detonator has been emitting
a 76 GHz field.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.742
- Now it's spiking.
- Okay. What does this mean?

28:25.287 --> 28:27.153
It means there's something wrong
with the bomb.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.082
It's a shame really. He was very cute.

28:33.003 --> 28:33.993
(GROANS)

28:34.796 --> 28:36.913
Signal's fritzing again.
Closer Cayden gets to Laurel,

28:37.007 --> 28:38.373
the bigger the frequency spikes
on the detonator.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.457
No, it's not the detonator.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.259
Aren't you gonna ask me why I did it?

28:45.515 --> 28:46.631
No.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.512
I know you're lying.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.847
You're not nearly as callous
as you portray yourself to be.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.645
I saw, Ms. Lance.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.272
When I ordered you to execute
Mr. Sobel, I saw you hesitate.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.066
You didn't wanna do it.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.275
(COLLAR BEEPS)

29:06.536 --> 29:08.698
Oliver, you need to get Laurel
away from Cayden, right now.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.872
<i>His detonator is interfering
with her power-dampening collar.</i>

29:15.254 --> 29:18.588
Well, well, well.
Now this is interesting.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.602
Laurel!

29:37.859 --> 29:39.066
Guys, are you okay? Do you copy?

29:40.445 --> 29:41.481
Overwatch, we're fine.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.187
Okay, thermal imaging reads
everyone's still inside,

29:43.282 --> 29:44.523
but they've gone
in different directions.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.358
I'm good. Find Anatoly.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.488
I've got Diaz. Go!

29:48.912 --> 29:49.902
WILD DOG: Sure thing, hoss.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.951
- Knew this would happen.
- What?

29:56.044 --> 29:58.661
We work with Oliver, we get in trouble.
The guy's a walking death trap.

29:59.548 --> 30:00.538
(GRUNTING)

30:01.049 --> 30:02.915
Who do you think taught him about traps?

30:03.719 --> 30:04.709
(GRUNTING)

30:20.319 --> 30:22.436
- Stop!
- God, you're persistent.

30:22.696 --> 30:23.686
It's annoying.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.564
(BOTH GRUNTING)

30:45.302 --> 30:46.292
(WILD DOG GROANS)

30:49.514 --> 30:50.630
Son of a bitch.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.507
(BOTH GRUNTING)

31:08.950 --> 31:10.316
Dinah! No!

31:10.744 --> 31:11.780
No!

31:24.383 --> 31:25.373
(GROANING)

31:26.760 --> 31:28.717
Laurel! Laurel!

31:43.235 --> 31:44.351
William?

31:44.778 --> 31:45.859
William, back away, son.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.361
Your son wouldn't want you to do this.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.826
The person responsible
for his death is in the vicinity.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.408
And I intend to drag them
to hell with me.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.165
I owe it to my son.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.205
Look at me.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.091
You don't be afraid, all right?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.798
I'm right here with you.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.843
I love you very much.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.508
William.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.226
I had an obligation to protect my son.

32:22.566 --> 32:25.650
It's a father's job
to protect your child.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.692
But I failed.

32:31.450 --> 32:35.615
I failed him, utterly.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.031
All this time,

32:43.128 --> 32:45.495
the man responsible for his death

32:48.925 --> 32:49.915
was me.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.888
Don't you move.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.984
I can't believe he was ready
to blow up the whole city.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.487
Yeah.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.035
He lost his boy.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.783
I don't even wanna...

33:21.958 --> 33:22.948
Yeah.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.578
What you did was very dangerous.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.167
I know and I'm sorry.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.971
I am never gonna let
anything happen to you, William.

33:37.849 --> 33:38.965
Ever.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.476
And I am promising you,
that I will do everything I can

33:42.562 --> 33:44.554
to make sure nothing happens to me.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.189
- You can't make that promise.
- I can make that promise.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.601
I just did. I am. Right now.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.440
Kiddo, I've been doing this a long time.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.619
So trust me.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.323
Okay?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.492
Okay.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.078
Thank you.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.665
I gotta go talk to the others,
all right?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.000
Okay.

34:15.971 --> 34:16.960
Where are we?

34:17.054 --> 34:20.219
If by "we" you mean Anatoly,
Diaz and Laurel...

34:20.308 --> 34:21.549
Completely in the wind.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.679
- RENE: Again?
- Again.

34:23.937 --> 34:27.021
Well, Quentin's walking Cayden James
to booking right now.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.643
Look, I know what you're all gonna say

34:29.734 --> 34:31.771
but I think finding Laurel
needs to be our first priority.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.147
Don't make this personal, Dinah.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.522
CURTIS: Or you know, more personal.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.524
You heard her.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.658
She is the one who had
Cayden James' son killed,

34:39.744 --> 34:41.485
she was the one who set
all of this into motion.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.663
- You don't know that.
- She confessed.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.036
She was pushing James' buttons, D.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.784
How did she manage
to blind all of you this much?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.252
You're the one who's not seeing clearly,

34:50.338 --> 34:51.328
if you ask me, Dinah.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.663
I didn't.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.248
Hey. Hey.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.255
You're better than this.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.678
- I guess we're leaving now.
- Yeah, we're leaving now.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.769
Just to be clear, whatever happened
doesn't change anything.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.560
Yeah, we're glad
we took down Cayden James,

35:13.653 --> 35:15.736
but we're still doing our own thing.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.237
Please try and keep Dinah in line.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.196
No promises, hoss.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.036
In case you haven't noticed

35:25.123 --> 35:26.989
we're not having a lot of luck
with that right now.

35:30.587 --> 35:34.706
Well, we saved the city again
and got Cayden James.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.630
Yeah. Why doesn't that feel like we won?

35:50.398 --> 35:53.141
I must say this visit
is somewhat predictable.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.482
Well, I needed to look you
in the eyes, Cayden.

36:00.116 --> 36:05.077
I need to know that
this surrender of yours

36:07.165 --> 36:08.701
isn't some sort of ploy.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.078
I've had bad luck with that tactic.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.873
You prevented from doing
the unspeakable last night.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.335
I'm sure Owen
would have been ashamed of me.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.422
But then he always was.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.262
These are my best guesses,

36:28.353 --> 36:30.640
as to where you might find
my former allies,

36:30.939 --> 36:34.103
along with the account number
to a bank in Corto Maltese

36:34.192 --> 36:37.481
where I placed all the money
I embezzled from the city.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.812
Thank you.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.233
I would ask one thing in return,

36:45.370 --> 36:47.783
permission to visit my son's grave.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.657
I can arrange that.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.545
Be a better father than I was, Oliver.

37:12.647 --> 37:17.017
If this is another feeble attempt
to extract information from me,

37:17.110 --> 37:20.274
I warn you, I will continue to invoke

37:20.864 --> 37:23.777
my Fifth Amendment protections.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.076
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you this, Mr. James,

37:28.997 --> 37:30.909
but your son Owen
was found murdered last night.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.994
No.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.961
He's 18!

37:38.798 --> 37:39.834
No!

37:40.049 --> 37:42.336
(SOBBING) Who would wanna hurt my boy?

37:42.510 --> 37:43.967
I'm afraid we don't know.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.596
I am truly very sorry, Cayden.

38:06.910 --> 38:07.900
(EXHALES)

38:10.705 --> 38:11.741
Hey.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.660
What's your story, morning glory?

38:14.334 --> 38:15.324
(GRUNTS)

38:16.795 --> 38:19.253
I used to say that to you
when you're a little girl, you know?

38:20.423 --> 38:21.709
The other you.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.882
- I already told you.
- I know what you told me.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.631
What you told me was a lie.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.054
(STAMMERS) James said it.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.637
You hesitated when you killed Sobel.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.518
So what if I did?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.929
It means there's a piece,
maybe just a small piece

38:37.023 --> 38:41.017
but it means that there is a piece
of my daughter in you, somewhere.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.812
And I'm gonna get it out,
whatever it takes.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.149
(ENGINE STARTING)

38:52.413 --> 38:53.403
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

39:18.857 --> 39:20.314
Didn't think we'd end up here.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.652
SCPD custody.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.191
You know, I saw this playing out
in a lot of ways.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.118
But I gotta tell you

39:37.125 --> 39:38.787
I wasn't expecting this.

39:39.252 --> 39:43.121
I assume it would be foolish to think
that this is a rescue operation.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.628
You're always the smartest guy
in the room.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.470
You thought you always had
everybody pegged.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.052
You've put everyone
in your little boxes,

39:56.436 --> 39:58.428
you always understood
what they were thinking,

39:59.397 --> 40:00.604
how they'd react.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.772
But you're realizing now,

40:03.484 --> 40:04.975
you didn't really know anything.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.782
I'm afraid I don't take
your meaning, Mr. Diaz.

40:11.868 --> 40:12.984
Is that so?

40:15.371 --> 40:17.078
You're supposed to be the smart one.

40:22.879 --> 40:24.336
You made some moves,

40:25.006 --> 40:26.497
then I made some moves,

40:27.342 --> 40:29.083
Queen is under indictment now.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.715
His team is fractured
into million pieces.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.758
And this city,

40:36.059 --> 40:37.391
oh, this city,

40:40.063 --> 40:41.975
it's prime for a takeover.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.605
You see, guys like you
never understand these things.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.146
Why destroy a city

40:53.117 --> 40:54.699
when you could take it over?

40:57.497 --> 41:00.581
I suppose this accounts
for your presence here.

41:03.252 --> 41:07.087
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

41:08.925 --> 41:11.167
along with a few other city officials.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.262
Arclight

41:16.641 --> 41:19.133
was a big help in thinning
the herd for me.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.807
I suspect you're not done
thinning the herd.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.486
You were always talking about
how much you missed your son.

41:31.948 --> 41:35.692
I guess you didn't know
I'm the one who had him killed.

41:35.785 --> 41:36.775
(CHOKES)

41:37.745 --> 41:38.735
(THUDS)

41:45.837 --> 41:47.453
Tell your boy

41:49.007 --> 41:50.248
I said hello.
