00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.145
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.313
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:06.066 --> 01:10.529
And so, Doc,
working from her home laboratory,

01:10.612 --> 01:15.701
collects hundreds of samples in the hopes
of finding an elusive bacteria

01:15.784 --> 01:19.329
that could break down
microplastics in the ocean.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.334
Let me have my documentary moment.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.046
I'm serious, dude.
I think this bacteria is the one.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.091
If I can just maintain the temperature,

01:31.175 --> 01:34.052
I think this guy is gonna eat
plastic for breakfast.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.388
And if it does, I get to name it.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.391
I think I'm gonna call it Munchie.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.101
We might tweak that later.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.063
Oh, no! The heater's broken.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.611
You! A screw.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.406
I'm not gonna let you kill Munchie.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.533
I gotta get you back in
and fix this thing.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.913
Thank you, Sprocket.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.373
This is one tiny screw.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.418
Oh, to have baby hands right now.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.795
Oh, dang it!

02:16.553 --> 02:17.971
No, I'd like to--

02:18.055 --> 02:22.059
-Please, just-- I'm coming through!
-Pardon me. Excuse me!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.352
So am I!

02:25.938 --> 02:30.025
Well, the waterfall's still barely
flowing for some mysterious reason.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.610
I wonder why.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.905
All the water is ours!

02:34.988 --> 02:37.199
Gorgs, Gorgs, Gorgs, Gorgs.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.160
Well, chant with me, Son.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.915
And the water we do have is
full of that gross goo.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.750
I had to unclog my whistle.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.044
Somebody's gotta figure
this goo thing out.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.422
The Merggles can't stay
in Boober's laundry tubs forever.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.509
Yeah, I'm not amped on being cramped, bro.

02:55.592 --> 02:59.596
Okay! So who's up for some aqua aerobics?

03:00.806 --> 03:04.142
And fin and splish and splash and sploosh.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.270
-Soup bro.
-What?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.565
We'd love another pot of that seaweed stew
when you canskies.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
Yeah. Sure, sure. Hey, Red.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.193
Is there anything I could do?

03:13.277 --> 03:15.237
I mean, something more important?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.780
Besides making soup?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.907
-Melody!
-Oh, no.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.450
Tail at 90 degrees.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.996
And fin and splish and splash and sploosh.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.622
Fin and splish…

03:26.957 --> 03:28.166
Careful, Craggles.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.335
Chaotic vibes in here.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.420
And fin and splish…

03:31.503 --> 03:35.174
Hey, Mokey. I've just finished
some pumpkin bisque for the Craggles.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.384
Is there anything else I could do?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.803
My water bucket.

03:39.887 --> 03:44.016
I need it to get more fresh water
from Sweetwater Creek for the Merggles.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.603
Loving reminder, we share this bucket.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.646
And I don't mean to lean into conflict,

03:49.730 --> 03:53.483
but the Merggles' morning water aerobics
have been keeping the Craggles up.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.361
Well, there's no good time.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.239
The Craggles are always dream-playing!

04:00.616 --> 04:02.659
Don't let this energy in, Craggles.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.369
Just breathe now…

04:05.412 --> 04:06.872
and dance later.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.251
Mokey, Craggles--

04:11.335 --> 04:13.629
-Fin, splish, splash and sploosh!
-Red?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.589
-Fin and…
-So many problems to solve, eh?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.468
Here comes Wembley
and the World's Oldest Fraggle.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.553
Let's see
what the Wise Council's come up with.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.347
Young Boober?

04:24.348 --> 04:28.352
The Wise Council could really use
your help.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.980
You could?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.526
Can we get some more
of that radish noodle soup?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.487
One of us ate too much,
and not everybody got some.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.157
It was me. I ate too much.

04:43.992 --> 04:44.993
Yeah, sure.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.995
I love me some soup, eh?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.081
Thanks, Boober.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.628
That was a big sigh. You all right?

04:54.711 --> 04:58.507
Yeah. It's just that everyone's doing
something important

04:58.590 --> 05:00.133
and I'm just the soup guy.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.552
Don't get me wrong,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.011
I love making soup.

05:03.095 --> 05:07.140
Who doesn't love a tasteful gumbo
or a sensible bouillabaisse, am I right?

05:07.766 --> 05:09.726
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.397
I just wish I was doing
something more meaningful.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.275
Everybody has something
important to contribute.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.653
My Uncle Matt was telling me
about this in a postcard.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.572
You just go right for it, huh?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.156
"Dear Nephew Gobo…"

05:23.240 --> 05:27.035
Sometimes it's easy to forget
how much you have to offer to this world.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.997
Not for me, of course,
but for others, it can be.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.707
Why, just the other day,

05:31.790 --> 05:34.877
I came upon some Silly Creatures
looking purposeless.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.212
They needed some guidance.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.590
Luckily for them, I was there.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.679
Just seeing me brought them new life.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.601
What an honor for all of you.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.729
-Excuse me, sir.
-Excuse me.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.982
Sir, I'm in the middle of something.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.109
-Security!
-Yes. Yes.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.153
Security! Security!

06:01.236 --> 06:02.821
Are you ready?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.866
One group of Silly Creatures
were so excited by my presence

06:05.949 --> 06:08.660
that they started
to spontaneously play music.

06:09.661 --> 06:13.081
Remember, Gobo,
everybody has something special to offer.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.458
I'm glad I could help.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.877
Glad you're all happy. You're welcome.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.713
"Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt."

06:19.796 --> 06:20.797
See?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.800
I have something to offer: soup.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.054
That's not meaningful.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.098
-That's lunch.
-Boober, I--

06:30.933 --> 06:33.352
Gee. He seems really down.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.896
Hey, I'll write him a song. Yeah.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.023
Bee-ba-Boober

06:38.106 --> 06:40.567
You got that dee-dup-dup-dup-doober

06:41.109 --> 06:43.278
Yep, yep. Another perfect Gobo song.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.489
Yep, I am good.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.451
Okay, I've got radish noodle soup
for the Fraggles,

06:49.535 --> 06:51.245
pumpkin bisque for the Craggles,

06:51.328 --> 06:52.829
seaweed stew for the Merggles

06:52.913 --> 06:55.624
and baby corn soup for the Doozers.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.547
That is so bland.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.550
This is gonna need a lot more radishes.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.847
And of course I'm out of radishes.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
Yeah. I don't know
what happened to 'em all.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.268
Thanks a lot, Bongo.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.479
I guess I'll go to the Gorg's garden
and get some more by myself.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.942
If someone's gotta face sudden doom,
might as well be the soup guy.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.528
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
Wish you didn't have to go.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.239
It's wild how radishes just vanish, eh?

07:29.575 --> 07:30.909
This is impossible.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.995
What are you, a screw for ants?

07:33.871 --> 07:36.206
You know what? Scientists adapt.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.001
Sprocket, we need to keep this tank warm.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.212
So blow your hot dog breath on this.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.430
Okay, that wasn't my best idea.
I'm glad nobody saw that.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.766
It's just wild that
this whole thing rides on one tiny screw.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.187
I better get a teeny screwdriver.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.650
There's a "Teeny-Tiny Hardware"
on Juniper.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.444
Who knew?

08:06.361 --> 08:10.115
All right, Sprocket, just think
warm thoughts in that direction.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.200
I'll be back.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.259
Okay. You can do this.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.304
Just grab a radish and head back.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.307
And don't get squished.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.438
All right. No sign of the Gorgs.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.274
I guess this is gonna be a quick,
easy trip.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.901
Help!

08:45.984 --> 08:47.945
Come on. Come quick. We need you.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.322
Yeah. Marjory's sick. Hurry!

08:51.490 --> 08:54.201
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Come on, come on, come on!

08:57.829 --> 09:00.624
Thank goodness you're here,
little Fraggle.

09:00.707 --> 09:05.712
-You are the only one who can save me.
-Yeah.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.881
Me?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.219
Nothing beats a road trip.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.096
Well, I mean, work is better,

09:14.179 --> 09:18.225
but I need some inspiration
to fix this goo problem.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.812
I've never seen this tunnel before.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.023
Yeah. Yeah, this'll do.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.992
I may be trash, but I feel like garbage.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.326
What's wrong, Madam Heap?

09:36.910 --> 09:40.581
That's what I need you to find out,
little Fraggle.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.332
She hasn't been herself lately.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.751
-No, her compost has lost its sparkle.
-Yeah.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.045
Yeah, but I'm the last Fraggle
that you want.

09:47.129 --> 09:51.175
You want Gobo or Red
or Mokey or Wembley or…

09:51.258 --> 09:52.259
or even Pogey.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.969
I'm just the soup guy.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.470
No!

09:55.554 --> 09:57.681
You must go.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.183
Go?

09:59.683 --> 10:00.684
Go where?

10:00.767 --> 10:04.146
Into the trash.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.072
Yo, little, little Fraggle.
You're the only hope I have.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.617
Help me.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.036
What am I even looking for?

10:19.119 --> 10:23.290
Oh, well,
I feel like I'm all broken up inside.

10:23.832 --> 10:28.337
I need you to put it all together.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.463
Put it all--

10:32.257 --> 10:33.800
Oh, that looks nice.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.221
Okay. Yeah.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.598
Well, thanks for having me.
I'll see myself out.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.391
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, no, you don't.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.685
No, no, no, no, you must go.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.147
You have got to go and help me,
little Fraggle.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.202
Is this even sanitary?

11:00.285 --> 11:03.830
Deep within you, you're brave.
You can do it.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.090
-I love a dramatic exit.
-Sensational.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.396
Okay--

11:28.814 --> 11:30.899
I'm in a mountain of trash.

11:32.818 --> 11:37.114
I'm in a mountain of trash!

11:46.832 --> 11:48.208
I've done it!

11:48.292 --> 11:51.628
I've scaled the hairy mountain!

11:53.463 --> 11:54.464
Cave quake.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.638
So many interesting machines.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.857
Well, that screw
doesn't belong down there.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.651
It belongs over there.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.069
Here we go.

12:17.946 --> 12:18.947
There.

12:19.031 --> 12:22.409
A place for everything,
and everything in its place.

12:23.785 --> 12:24.786
Okay.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.252
This project uses nature to heal nature.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.596
Everything in its place.

12:43.222 --> 12:45.474
Nature healing nature.

12:46.725 --> 12:50.896
Maybe I shouldn't be building
something to get the goo out of the water.

12:51.647 --> 12:55.692
Maybe the solution needs
to come from nature.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.695
The goo came from a vine.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.824
Maybe the vine is the key
to cleaning it back up.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.538
All right.

13:08.121 --> 13:13.502
I'm gonna handle this
in a calm and logical--

13:14.086 --> 13:15.712
Get me out of here.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.590
There must be a way out.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.469
Get me out of here! This'll work.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.056
Or not.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.812
Okay.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.523
Got that out of my system.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.275
Now think, Boober, think.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.068
What did Trash Heap say?

13:38.902 --> 13:42.406
I need you to put it all together.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.325
Okay, thanks. Makes perfect sense.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.828
There's gotta be a way out of here!

13:56.378 --> 13:58.589
Mokey's old sketchbook?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.799
Well, what's that doing down here?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.553
And a Craggle pillow.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.432
And a Doozer helmet.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.519
Boy, I thought the trash heap
was only for Gorg trash.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.563
I can't believe it.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.733
There's trash from the Fraggles
and the Craggles

14:17.816 --> 14:20.444
and the Merggles and even the Doozers!

14:21.028 --> 14:22.029
I guess--

14:23.071 --> 14:26.950
I guess the trash heap
is made up of all of us.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.452
All of us.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.211
Oh, boy.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.547
Okay, this is totally normal.
Totally normal. Totally normal.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.343
Now, Red,
Mokey needs a bucket for the Craggles.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.345
-I need it for the Merggles!
-Yeah--

14:46.428 --> 14:49.389
Well, maybe the Merggles don't want
constant water aerobics!

14:49.473 --> 14:51.225
It's aqua aerobics!

14:51.308 --> 14:52.893
Then this is a ridiculous fight!

14:52.976 --> 14:54.478
I know, but I wanna win!

14:57.814 --> 15:00.108
What in Doozerdom are you doing?

15:00.192 --> 15:02.194
If the Fraggles won't eat the buildings,

15:02.277 --> 15:05.072
we'll just knock 'em down
and rebuild ourselves.

15:06.907 --> 15:07.908
Oh, no.

15:11.578 --> 15:15.749
They call me the architect,
but I never planned for this.

15:20.838 --> 15:22.339
This'll do it.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.799
Don't worry, Junior Junior.

15:23.882 --> 15:28.053
We'll get all that goo off of you
so you're clean and beautiful.

15:28.971 --> 15:29.972
-Yeah.
-Junior!

15:31.348 --> 15:32.599
What are you doing?

15:34.351 --> 15:38.605
I was just demonstrating
what no Gorg should ever do.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.066
Bad tree.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.819
-Okay, good.
-Bad tree.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.779
Wait a minute. No!

15:45.863 --> 15:49.700
You're wasting Gorg water on that tree.

15:50.659 --> 15:54.079
But, Pa!
He was getting sick from all the goo.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.915
-I just wanted to clean him off--
-Now I don't wanna hear it.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.041
You're a Gorg.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.003
Now throw that tree down the well.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.423
Down the well?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.466
But, Pa, no!

16:06.550 --> 16:07.593
Junior!

16:12.389 --> 16:13.473
Down the well.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.686
Oh, no.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.315
Goodbye, my little big tree.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.983
I'll never forget you.

16:26.528 --> 16:27.654
Wembley, I tell ya.

16:27.738 --> 16:30.407
-I've never seen Fraggle Rock like this.
-I know.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.117
I'm so sorry.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.913
It feels like the sky is falling.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.001
What?

16:44.463 --> 16:46.423
Okay, this is totally normal.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.218
What do I do?

16:49.301 --> 16:51.220
Put it all together.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.181
Put it all together.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.392
No, no, no. No. What does that mean?

16:57.476 --> 17:01.021
-Put it all together.
-Put it all together.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.191
Maybe if I--

17:04.942 --> 17:06.944
Come here. Yeah, that's good.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.530
Yeah. Okay, you guys, come here.

17:09.613 --> 17:10.696
Come on. Yeah.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.746
Oh, no. Now what?

17:21.959 --> 17:22.960
A soup pot?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.878
So I'm just the soup guy down here too?

17:25.963 --> 17:27.464
Is this a joke?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.511
Did I even help Marjory?

17:32.594 --> 17:36.765
-What happened down there?
-Yeah, she's in worse shape than ever!

17:36.849 --> 17:38.851
Well, of course I didn't.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.688
-Talk to us, Marjory!
-Please.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.398
See? I told you.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.066
I was the wrong Fraggle for this.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.402
Hey, what's with the soup pot?

17:48.485 --> 17:50.279
Yeah, what is that, brass?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.031
Peace soup.

17:53.782 --> 17:58.245
-Pardon?
-Peace soup.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.373
You want me to make pea soup?

18:03.876 --> 18:07.421
The Trash Heap has spoken.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.299
Maybe for the last time.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.472
-Marjory!
-Marjory!

18:19.474 --> 18:20.475
Yuck.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.562
Pea soup was never my specialty.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.773
Now, worrying, worrying is my specialty.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.526
If I can make a soup out of that,
we'd be set.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.820
It needs something.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.238
But what?

18:33.322 --> 18:35.449
Cupboard's bare. Don't know what happened.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.077
Put it all together.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.412
This again?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.831
Some good it did inside Trash Mountain.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.166
It didn't save you.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.377
Put it all together.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.671
Let's see.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.299
I've got Fraggle soup, Craggle soup,

18:52.382 --> 18:54.968
Merggle soup and Doozer soup.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.096
What-- What if I--

18:59.723 --> 19:01.808
Let's see what we got

19:03.310 --> 19:06.772
All the puzzle pieces in one spot

19:07.814 --> 19:10.317
A dab of you and me

19:10.400 --> 19:12.110
Harmony

19:13.028 --> 19:15.447
Could be when we

19:15.531 --> 19:19.743
Put it all together in one mix

19:19.826 --> 19:23.872
Put it all together, see how it fits

19:23.956 --> 19:27.125
I think it might do the trick

19:27.209 --> 19:31.922
It could bring them all together

19:32.005 --> 19:34.132
-It smells wonderful.
-Hot!

19:34.216 --> 19:35.217
My!

19:37.803 --> 19:39.429
That's really good.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.182
Wow! Look at it go.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.644
Everyone's included

19:45.727 --> 19:47.020
The perfect combo.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.898
A work of art

19:49.982 --> 19:51.567
With all the hearts

19:51.650 --> 19:54.570
I'd say I found a way to

19:55.153 --> 19:58.699
Put it all together in one mix

19:58.782 --> 20:02.703
Put it all together, the perfect fit

20:02.786 --> 20:05.539
Feels like it could do the trick

20:05.622 --> 20:08.333
It could bring us all

20:08.417 --> 20:10.127
Together

20:10.210 --> 20:12.462
Put it all together

20:13.797 --> 20:16.133
Put it all together

20:17.843 --> 20:20.679
Feels like it could do the trick

20:20.762 --> 20:24.349
-It could bring us all
-Bring us all

20:24.433 --> 20:26.727
Together

20:29.396 --> 20:30.689
I like the soup too!

20:32.691 --> 20:35.277
Well, it may be all the warm soup
in my belly,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.696
but if we were to cooperate
and work together,

20:37.779 --> 20:39.823
we could solve all the problems.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.492
-Yeah, we could.
-That's a brilliant idea.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.620
Yeah, we'll all ride that wave.

20:44.703 --> 20:48.916
Hey, here's a start. I figured out
how to get the goo out of the pond.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.709
Wow.

20:50.792 --> 20:55.047
Look. The vines can reabsorb the goo.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.092
Wow.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.471
Oh, look.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.515
Look at that.

21:04.598 --> 21:07.267
Nature wants to heal itself.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.644
We can clean the pond.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.728
-Yay!
-Yes!

21:09.811 --> 21:11.647
-Wow. That's great.
-Yeah!

21:11.730 --> 21:13.982
This is a clean pond. Oh, yes.

21:14.066 --> 21:17.861
Which means the Doozers can build again!

21:17.945 --> 21:19.905
Yeah!

21:19.988 --> 21:21.114
That's great news.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.575
And we can swim home
when the water's clean.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.702
After we help you Fraggles

21:25.786 --> 21:27.913
figure out what's wrong
with your waterfall

21:27.996 --> 21:30.457
and how to redirect water
back to Craggle Lagoon.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.626
-Yes!
-Yes, yes, yes!

21:32.709 --> 21:36.380
You hear that, Henchy?
The Wise Council figured it all out.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.091
Well…

21:39.174 --> 21:41.718
Boober, you know what?
That was amazing.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.345
Because of your delicious soup,

21:43.428 --> 21:46.223
everyone's coming together
and working on ideas in peace.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.766
Yeah.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.935
Wait a minute. Peace.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.479
-Peace soup. Pea sou--
-Yeah?

21:52.563 --> 21:54.606
Pea soup is peace soup.

21:55.232 --> 21:58.235
-Now I get it.
-I don't get it.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.238
Guys, it's something
that the Trash Heap said.

22:01.822 --> 22:02.823
I saved her a bowl.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.284
-Come on. Let's go get it to her.
-Okay, come on.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.538
Madam Heap, you're better!

22:09.621 --> 22:12.416
Yes. And all thanks to you,

22:12.499 --> 22:17.671
you brave, very smart
and very important little Fraggle.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.049
But what changed?

22:21.967 --> 22:26.013
Fraggles, Doozers, Merggles, Craggles.

22:26.096 --> 22:30.434
When you're not at peace,
I cannot be either.

22:30.517 --> 22:35.063
But you, Boober,
you brought everyone together,

22:35.147 --> 22:37.733
and that's what healed me.

22:37.816 --> 22:41.361
-You're all better, Marjory.
-Sensational. Dynamite!

22:41.445 --> 22:42.779
You look neat.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.740
-Powerful.
-You're an icon.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.784
Okay. That's plenty of that.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.995
Now, there's always more to do,

22:50.078 --> 22:53.123
but what you saw today is that

22:53.207 --> 22:55.834
harmony is the path.

23:00.255 --> 23:03.300
The Trash Heap has spoken.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.887
And she will continue
to speak in good health.

23:06.970 --> 23:07.971
Nyah!

23:08.055 --> 23:11.016
Okay, okay, okay. Now, give me that soup.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.351
I could eat.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.270
Yeah, please. Come on. Don't be shy.

23:21.527 --> 23:26.406
Well, Teeny-Tiny Hardware on Juniper
was actually a punk rock jewelry store,

23:26.490 --> 23:28.992
but they did have
a tiny screwdriver they lent me.

23:29.785 --> 23:31.537
Sprocket! How--

23:31.620 --> 23:33.330
Did you-- What happened?

23:33.413 --> 23:36.458
It's fixed. It's a miracle.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.127
You kept Munchie alive, buddy.

23:40.546 --> 23:44.675
And pretty soon,
we're gonna put him to work

23:44.758 --> 23:50.055
and find out if he's the little guy
that's gonna save the world.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.150
Well, I can't wait to get to work.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.735
Thanks to Boober's peace soup,

24:03.819 --> 24:05.904
we have a solid plan
for almost everything.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.615
-Yeah.
-The goo, Craggle Lagoon, the Merggles.

24:08.699 --> 24:12.536
But we still don't know
what happened to our waterfall.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.163
-I mean, where did it go?
-Yeah.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.248
Yeah.

24:19.293 --> 24:20.961
Maybe there?

24:26.133 --> 24:29.511
Okay. So we just gotta get our water
back from…

24:30.512 --> 24:31.972
the Gorgs.

24:32.055 --> 24:35.017
It's gonna be tough,
but I think we can do it together.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.686
Whatever you say, soup guy.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.522
Fraggles!

24:56.455 --> 24:58.332
They threw us in a cage

24:58.415 --> 24:59.791
And there's no key

24:59.875 --> 25:01.877
-We gotta find a way
-I wanna sing too.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.253
That we can get free

25:03.337 --> 25:05.964
Just one thing that might be found

25:06.048 --> 25:09.593
Gonna rock this joint
Till the bars fall down

25:09.676 --> 25:13.096
'Cause everybody here gotta shout
Till we all break out

25:13.180 --> 25:15.516
Fraggle Rock
Fraggle Rock

25:15.599 --> 25:18.519
We gonna rock our way to freedom

25:18.602 --> 25:21.813
Gonna roll right back and seat 'em

25:21.897 --> 25:24.149
Gonna flip flop skipity hop

25:24.233 --> 25:25.859
Back to Fraggle Rock

25:25.943 --> 25:26.985
Yeah!

25:31.865 --> 25:34.993
Mokey took a stick and she banged bars

25:35.077 --> 25:36.328
Red started rockin'…

25:36.411 --> 25:37.996
Thank you for catching me.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.625
Boober blew a horn like a wild thing

25:41.708 --> 25:45.003
Got myself a guitar and began to sing

25:45.087 --> 25:48.590
Everybody here gotta shout
Till we all break out

25:48.674 --> 25:50.843
Fraggle Rock
Fraggle Rock

25:50.926 --> 25:53.637
We're gonna rock our way to freedom

25:53.720 --> 25:56.974
Gonna roll right back and seat 'em

25:57.558 --> 26:00.853
Gonna flip flop skipity hop
Back to Fraggle Rock

26:00.936 --> 26:03.188
I'm sorry. I'd love to stay, but I cannot.

26:03.272 --> 26:04.857
-Love you!
-I love you too!

26:05.524 --> 26:06.525
Unhand me.
