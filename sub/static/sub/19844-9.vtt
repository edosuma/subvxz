00:01.043 --> 00:02.423
<i>Previously on</i> The Originals...

00:02.424 --> 00:03.802
Marcel, do me a favor. I want you to keep

00:03.804 --> 00:06.125
that book far away from me.
If I even try to come for it,

00:06.128 --> 00:07.107
I want you to kill me.

00:07.109 --> 00:08.754
DEMONIC VOICE: <i>The Ancestors</i>

00:08.757 --> 00:11.291
<i>drive me into their darkness.</i>

00:11.294 --> 00:13.480
<i>You will give me a safe place to hide.</i>

00:13.482 --> 00:15.449
The Hollow created the werewolf curse.

00:15.451 --> 00:17.250
It was your line that began it all,

00:17.252 --> 00:19.586
and yours alone, that still
has power over the Hollow.

00:19.588 --> 00:21.554
That's why she's been hunting Labonairs.

00:21.557 --> 00:23.991
- If you die, there's only one Labonair left.
- Hope.

00:23.993 --> 00:25.359
After the tribe killed the Hollow,

00:25.361 --> 00:26.560
they burned her remains.

00:26.562 --> 00:28.295
<i>Which would allow her to be reborn.</i>

00:28.297 --> 00:29.630
Not if she's free... She won't stop

00:29.632 --> 00:30.897
until those pieces are gathered.

00:30.899 --> 00:33.800
Trapping me requires
the life of an immortal.

00:33.802 --> 00:35.535
I promise you, I will make this right.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.804
Then start by giving this to Marcel.

00:37.806 --> 00:39.740
[door creaking]

00:39.742 --> 00:40.774
[cries out]

00:40.776 --> 00:42.599
Are you ready to die, Elijah?

00:42.602 --> 00:44.803
Because I'm quite ready to live.

00:48.769 --> 00:51.852
[straining]

00:51.854 --> 00:53.920
[gasping]

01:00.796 --> 01:02.562
Such a will to live.

01:02.564 --> 01:05.197
Wouldn't it be easier to give in?

01:05.200 --> 01:07.534
To simply let go?

01:07.536 --> 01:09.903
Part of you must crave that peace.

01:09.905 --> 01:13.006
The silence of the
nothing that lasts forever.

01:13.008 --> 01:16.943
Why don't you come a little closer...

01:16.945 --> 01:19.046
and we'll find it together.

01:19.048 --> 01:20.480
You'll have enough company.

01:20.482 --> 01:22.215
When you die, so, too,

01:22.217 --> 01:24.017
does your entire sire line.

01:24.019 --> 01:29.222
The great sacrifice that will
return me to flesh and blood.

01:29.224 --> 01:32.993
All I need now is the last of my remains

01:32.995 --> 01:34.561
for the ritual.

01:34.563 --> 01:36.663
Your family has done
the job of finding them,

01:36.665 --> 01:39.399
and they should be
coming to me soon enough.

01:39.401 --> 01:42.869
You can't expect to torment
my family and survive.

01:42.871 --> 01:46.273
I survived far worse
fates than your family.

01:46.275 --> 01:48.875
I say let them come.

01:48.877 --> 01:51.278
They will try to save
you from the poison

01:51.280 --> 01:53.480
coursing through your veins,

01:53.482 --> 01:58.085
and in doing so, they
will give me what I want.

01:58.087 --> 02:01.621
And as a reward for their efforts,

02:01.623 --> 02:05.559
I will let your family
watch as you finally die.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.900

02:18.407 --> 02:21.274
You've come early. Good.

02:21.276 --> 02:23.143
We're eager to serve.

02:23.145 --> 02:24.411
And your covens?

02:24.413 --> 02:26.146
More witches join us every day.

02:26.148 --> 02:29.950
They now know they're
either with us or against us.

02:29.952 --> 02:32.419
You New Orleans witches have been weak.

02:32.421 --> 02:35.055
Finally, you have a chance
to shed that frailty,

02:35.057 --> 02:38.325
just as I will shed this frail form.

02:38.327 --> 02:40.961
My rebirth will herald a new day

02:40.963 --> 02:43.597
to all who swear allegiance to me.

02:45.534 --> 02:48.153
Only a few final details remain.

03:13.762 --> 03:16.366
KLAUS: <i>Now, you can't call
yourself a connoisseur</i>

03:16.369 --> 03:18.965
if you have not sampled
each and every one of these.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.333
Hmm?

03:20.335 --> 03:22.836
Here.

03:22.838 --> 03:25.438
Mmm, it's so good!

03:27.075 --> 03:30.610
Did I ever tell you the
story of my first beignet?

03:30.612 --> 03:32.279
No?

03:32.281 --> 03:33.980
You are in for a treat.

03:33.982 --> 03:35.148
[Hope giggles]

03:35.150 --> 03:37.818
Long ago, three French nuns

03:37.820 --> 03:40.253
came to New Orleans
looking for a fresh start.

03:40.255 --> 03:41.555
And they came here.

03:41.557 --> 03:44.925
They marched right into our courtyard,

03:44.927 --> 03:46.993
and they presented
your Uncle Elijah and me

03:46.995 --> 03:49.696
with these rather lumpy-looking,

03:49.698 --> 03:51.865
sugar-coated pastries.

03:51.867 --> 03:55.435
Well, needless to
say, we were entranced.

03:55.437 --> 03:57.804
We set them up quite well.

03:59.107 --> 04:01.174
Why did they come to you?

04:01.176 --> 04:04.077
Because there was a time

04:04.079 --> 04:06.780
when we were regarded as royalty.

04:06.782 --> 04:10.584
You might even go so
far as to say I was king,

04:10.586 --> 04:14.221
which would make you a princess.

04:14.223 --> 04:15.889
[both chuckle]

04:15.891 --> 04:17.624
HAYLEY: Good morning.

04:20.062 --> 04:22.095
[clears throat]

04:22.096 --> 04:24.631
I guess apple turnover is fruit.

04:24.633 --> 04:28.335
Well, I saw no harm in indulging
our daughter's sweet tooth.

04:28.337 --> 04:30.337
All things igsmoderation, of course.

04:30.339 --> 04:32.973
Okay.

04:32.975 --> 04:34.307
Don't eat too many.

04:34.309 --> 04:35.709
You'll get a stomachache.

04:36.778 --> 04:38.778
Can we talk?

04:42.150 --> 04:43.617
Have you seen Elijah?

04:43.619 --> 04:45.051
I thought he was with you.

04:45.053 --> 04:46.386
I haven't seen him since

04:46.388 --> 04:48.688
he left for Marcel's last night.

04:48.690 --> 04:51.224
VINCENT: <i>This can't be good.</i>

04:52.961 --> 04:55.962
MAXINE: I came here for
quiet, to light candles,

04:55.964 --> 04:57.497
pray... found it like this.

04:57.499 --> 04:59.232
Knew you'd want to see.

04:59.234 --> 05:01.968
It's desecration of a holy site.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.336
It's meant to be a warning.

05:03.338 --> 05:05.138
I think it's more than that.

05:05.140 --> 05:06.940
We're losing people, Vincent.

05:06.942 --> 05:09.276
More and more witches
talking about making a pact

05:09.278 --> 05:11.111
with this darkness.

05:11.113 --> 05:13.413
When our covens see
the church like this,

05:13.415 --> 05:16.683
they'll think it's better
to join the side of the enemy

05:16.685 --> 05:18.685
before the enemy comes for them.

05:18.687 --> 05:20.387
Witches are defecting?

05:20.389 --> 05:23.890
Some say the Hollow's power
is what our covens need

05:23.892 --> 05:26.359
to fight vampires,
to take back the city.

05:26.361 --> 05:28.461
All the peace you fought for, to them,

05:28.463 --> 05:31.231
is nothing compared to the
promise of taking control.

05:31.233 --> 05:32.778
Tell me you don't believe that.

05:32.781 --> 05:34.701
Vincent, you know where I stand.

05:34.703 --> 05:37.003
[footsteps]

05:37.005 --> 05:38.672
So loyal.

05:40.509 --> 05:43.410
There was a time Vincent
showed me such devotion,

05:43.412 --> 05:46.346
when, in fact, he worshipped me.

05:46.348 --> 05:50.083
And now, how far he's fallen.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.687
Maxine, you need to go.

05:53.689 --> 05:56.222
I'm-I'm gonna be fine.

06:02.597 --> 06:04.064
Hello, Vincent.

06:04.066 --> 06:06.299
It's been far too long.

06:06.301 --> 06:08.234
I think it's time we
caught up with one another.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.603
Don't you?

06:11.506 --> 06:14.441
[jazz music playing]

06:16.211 --> 06:18.144
Still playing with toys, huh?

06:19.381 --> 06:23.383
It is a protection
spell for the compound.

06:23.385 --> 06:25.085
Representational magic,

06:25.087 --> 06:26.820
so it's not tied to my heartbeat,

06:26.822 --> 06:28.488
should anything happen to me.

06:28.490 --> 06:31.858
Can we pretend for, say, five seconds,

06:31.860 --> 06:33.727
that you don't have to
worry about dying today?

06:33.729 --> 06:35.895
I'm not going to die.

06:36.965 --> 06:39.232
Certainly not

06:39.234 --> 06:42.168
until well after breakfast.

06:42.170 --> 06:44.237
[gasps]

06:44.239 --> 06:46.272
Wow. [chuckles]

06:46.274 --> 06:48.208
You are perfect.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.442
Thanks.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.544
[cell phone buzzing]

06:51.546 --> 06:53.079
Um...

06:53.081 --> 06:55.515
[sighs]

06:55.517 --> 06:59.252
Mm, let me guess... Family drama.

06:59.254 --> 07:01.287
I'm so sorry.

07:01.289 --> 07:03.456
Can we meet later?

07:03.458 --> 07:06.493
Oh, no, Ms. Mikaelson, I'm coming with.

07:06.495 --> 07:07.894
You have your family's back.

07:07.896 --> 07:09.496
I've got yours.

07:09.498 --> 07:12.899
Right, right.

07:12.901 --> 07:15.535
You knew this day would come.

07:15.537 --> 07:18.338
All those years abstaining

07:18.340 --> 07:21.474
from magic, afraid
that if you practiced,

07:21.476 --> 07:23.610
I might come around.

07:23.612 --> 07:25.245
Still, after all that,

07:25.247 --> 07:26.413
here I am.

07:26.415 --> 07:27.747
Here you are.

07:27.749 --> 07:29.482
Hiding inside the body of a vampire,

07:29.484 --> 07:31.885
because you're not as strong
as you want me to think.

07:36.658 --> 07:39.626
You always had such spine.

07:41.029 --> 07:43.096
It's what I enjoyed most about you.

07:43.098 --> 07:46.966
And I know you enjoyed
the power I had to offer.

07:46.968 --> 07:48.401
It's still here, Vincent.

07:48.403 --> 07:50.503
You can have it all back if you want.

07:50.505 --> 07:53.640
You just need to swear loyalty to me.

07:53.642 --> 07:56.443
The only thing that I want

07:56.445 --> 07:59.646
is for you to slither back
into the rot that you came from.

08:04.152 --> 08:06.986
[groaning]

08:06.988 --> 08:09.489
Do you want to fight me?

08:09.491 --> 08:10.824
Well, come on!

08:10.826 --> 08:13.993
I should send you back
to join your dead wife.

08:15.330 --> 08:17.163
But I have a better idea.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.599
An offer, for you

08:19.601 --> 08:21.468
and the Mikaelsons.

08:21.470 --> 08:23.536
You can hear me out...

08:25.507 --> 08:27.540
or die.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.076
The choice is yours.

08:32.414 --> 08:35.448
MARCEL: <i>You're not listening to me.</i>

08:35.450 --> 08:37.750
All right, check again,
and when you do find her,

08:37.751 --> 08:40.285
you keep your distance and call me.

08:48.763 --> 08:51.064
You can come on in, Klaus.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.537
To what do I owe the displeasure?

08:57.539 --> 08:59.572
I thought we had a truce.

08:59.574 --> 09:01.241
We do.

09:01.243 --> 09:03.042
If we didn't, I might've
responded differently

09:03.044 --> 09:04.878
when Davina asked me to sacrifice you.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.779
And does our truce extend to my brother,

09:06.781 --> 09:09.315
despite your extensive grievances?

09:09.317 --> 09:11.217
Well, yeah, I want to get Sofya back

09:11.219 --> 09:12.452
and stop the Hollow.

09:12.454 --> 09:13.953
As long as you guys want the same thing,

09:13.955 --> 09:16.256
I don't see why we can't play nice.

09:16.258 --> 09:18.758
Why? What's wrong?

09:18.760 --> 09:23.229
Well, far be it from me
to jump to conclusions,

09:23.231 --> 09:25.198
but the last time anyone saw my brother,

09:25.200 --> 09:26.766
he was on his way here

09:26.768 --> 09:28.902
to talk to you.

09:28.904 --> 09:31.070
And you think I have him?

09:31.072 --> 09:33.740
Seriously?

09:36.878 --> 09:40.346
No, I don't.

09:41.917 --> 09:45.351
But I'd like to know who does.

09:47.589 --> 09:50.089
He's not at Marcel's.

09:50.091 --> 09:52.759
I'll find him.

09:56.164 --> 09:58.765
<i>Jalgida minu blóo mitt.</i>

09:58.767 --> 10:00.700
<i>Jalgida minu blóo mitt.</i>

10:04.005 --> 10:05.838
He's cloaked by magic.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.774
I can feel it.

10:09.611 --> 10:12.178
[soft clattering]

10:22.157 --> 10:23.756
That's her.

10:23.758 --> 10:26.292
That's the Hollow.

10:27.462 --> 10:29.696
She has Elijah, and
now she wants that bone.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.464
In exchange for Elijah?

10:31.466 --> 10:32.765
No, you don't understand.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.167
There won't be an exchange.

10:34.169 --> 10:36.636
She needs Elijah to die in
order to channel the energy

10:36.638 --> 10:38.776
from his sacrifice.
She's already poisoned him

10:38.779 --> 10:39.906
with the rose thorns.

10:39.908 --> 10:42.275
She wants this bone by
sundown. If she doesn't get it,

10:42.277 --> 10:44.711
then she's gonna come here
and she's gonna take it.

10:45.981 --> 10:47.513
And when she does,

10:47.515 --> 10:50.149
she's gonna burn this
entire city to the ground.

11:06.057 --> 11:09.792
Freya informs me your
mate Vincent has a plan.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.360
Just one tiny problem.

11:11.362 --> 11:12.728
I don't trust him.

11:12.730 --> 11:14.196
All right, Vincent
helped me keep the peace

11:14.198 --> 11:15.331
for five years.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.799
He knows the Hollow's power,

11:16.801 --> 11:19.235
and he is our best shot
at coming up with a plan.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.670
I have a plan of my own.

11:20.672 --> 11:21.904
We find this thing

11:21.906 --> 11:23.706
and its acolytes, we
slaughter the lot of them.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.741
And then stack their
bodies into a monument

11:25.743 --> 11:28.210
dedicated to those who
would threaten my family.

11:28.212 --> 11:31.580
Right, right. There's
just one problem with that.

11:32.616 --> 11:34.549
One of those bodies would be Sofya,

11:34.552 --> 11:36.152
and I want her alive.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.753
Please, Marcel.

11:37.755 --> 11:39.789
It's not a time to be sentimental.

11:39.791 --> 11:41.624
This is New Orleans, toss a few beads.

11:41.626 --> 11:42.876
You'll find another girl.

11:42.879 --> 11:45.161
That is the problem with you
and your family, all right?

11:45.163 --> 11:47.129
You'll do anything to save your brother,

11:47.131 --> 11:48.931
but to hell with anyone else, right?

11:48.933 --> 11:50.466
It all seems a little familiar.

11:50.469 --> 11:52.469
The Hollow is evil, yes.

11:52.472 --> 11:54.103
Do we want to defeat it? Yes.

11:54.105 --> 11:56.138
But I'm not willing to
stand by and watch someone

11:56.140 --> 11:59.419
that I care about become more
Mikaelson collateral damage.

11:59.422 --> 12:00.843
Oh, spare me your sanctimony.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.378
It was your refusal to make peace

12:02.380 --> 12:03.879
that led Elijah here last night.

12:03.881 --> 12:05.432
If you two had settled
your differences...

12:05.434 --> 12:06.800
- [pounds table]
- Enough!

12:07.418 --> 12:08.851
The only reason

12:08.853 --> 12:10.553
why you are still in this city

12:10.555 --> 12:11.687
is because I allow it.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.155
Now, do you want to fight me,

12:13.157 --> 12:15.691
or do you want to
find a way to end this?

12:18.629 --> 12:23.032
You want a plan of attack,
it comes down to this.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.368
Use the element of surprise.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.204
Now, Marcel will hand over the bone,

12:28.206 --> 12:31.373
and then stab the Hollow
with Hayley's blood,

12:31.375 --> 12:34.143
and then I'm gonna cast
the spell that buries her.

12:36.013 --> 12:37.947
HAYLEY: The Ancestors' spell

12:37.949 --> 12:40.049
requires a sacrifice.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.984
An Original has to die.

12:41.986 --> 12:44.386
Yeah, and right now, the Hollow
is gonna use Elijah's death

12:44.388 --> 12:46.388
to come back, but there's a window

12:46.390 --> 12:48.057
where I can use the sacrifice

12:48.059 --> 12:49.692
to shove her back into her grave.

12:49.694 --> 12:52.308
You'll forgive me for
stating the obvious,

12:52.311 --> 12:54.369
but your plan does
nothing to save my brother.

12:54.372 --> 12:57.032
In fact, it relies
entirely upon his death.

12:57.034 --> 12:58.234
Easy.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.102
He's just trying to help.

13:00.104 --> 13:03.539
Klaus, Elijah's already dead.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.374
Now, the only thing
that we can do right now

13:05.376 --> 13:06.609
is figure out whether or not that death

13:06.611 --> 13:07.877
is gonna count for something.

13:07.879 --> 13:10.513
That's not a call any of us get to make.

13:10.515 --> 13:12.815
Especially not you.

13:12.817 --> 13:14.383
There has to be a way to save him.

13:14.385 --> 13:16.018
Freya, you still have the antidote

13:16.020 --> 13:17.953
we used to cure Marcel's bite?

13:17.955 --> 13:19.855
I have it, yes.

13:19.857 --> 13:21.157
But I don't know if it'll work against

13:21.159 --> 13:22.658
the poison of the rosebush.

13:22.660 --> 13:23.993
You guys aren't listening, okay?

13:23.995 --> 13:25.895
Even if we do cure Elijah,

13:25.897 --> 13:27.863
we still have a big problem,
that's called the Hollow.

13:27.865 --> 13:30.556
And it's just gonna keep coming
at us until it resurrects.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.269
And when that happens, we're
talking about an ancient,

13:33.271 --> 13:34.937
primal power that's
made flesh and blood.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.524
It will wipe out this entire
city in an afternoon, and ain't

13:37.527 --> 13:39.942
a damn thing that you or anybody
else here can do about it.

13:39.944 --> 13:44.313
Now, my way? We take her out
while she's still a spirit.

13:44.315 --> 13:47.449
Elijah dies, but at least his
death counts for something.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.985
No. No, I'm not willing to
discuss this any further.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.720
What about your little girl?

13:53.457 --> 13:56.125
This thing wiped out the
entire Labonair bloodline.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.160
It already got to Hope once, right?

13:59.263 --> 14:00.663
Now, this is a chance, Klaus.

14:00.665 --> 14:01.997
This is probably the
one chance that you got.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.833
Now you want to blow that opportunity

14:03.835 --> 14:05.524
to maybe save your brother,

14:05.527 --> 14:07.903
or do you want to do you job
and save your little girl?

14:07.905 --> 14:11.707
Don't use my daughter to
justify your absurd plan.

14:11.709 --> 14:14.243
Hey, his "absurd" plan is
the only plan that we've got.

14:14.245 --> 14:16.680
So maybe we should do
a little less fighting,

14:16.683 --> 14:18.716
and a little more thinking.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.586
There's always a loophole.

14:24.622 --> 14:27.890
I have my mother's grimoires.

14:27.892 --> 14:31.227
I welcome you to study them with me.

14:37.468 --> 14:40.169
[quietly]: Okay.

14:50.414 --> 14:52.882
[Elijah grunting]

14:55.328 --> 14:56.761
SOFYA: Shh.

14:56.764 --> 14:58.315
It won't be long.

15:01.058 --> 15:03.058
Even if you finish this,

15:03.060 --> 15:06.595
my family will bury you.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.565
They will no doubt try.

15:09.567 --> 15:12.601
Though I believe the
odds are in my favor.

15:12.603 --> 15:15.665
Once the ritual is completed,
my spirit will return

15:15.668 --> 15:16.939
to New Orleans' soil.

15:16.941 --> 15:19.441
From it, I will be reborn

15:19.443 --> 15:22.011
far stronger than I have ever been.

15:22.013 --> 15:25.581
You are just another body
for my brother to slay.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.450
You expect your brother to avenge you?

15:28.452 --> 15:32.288
Inspired, perhaps, by
duty to the familial bond.

15:32.290 --> 15:34.924
I've been inside Klaus' mind.

15:34.926 --> 15:38.994
You care for one another so deeply.

15:38.996 --> 15:44.099
It's quite ludicrous, this
dedication to one's own blood.

15:44.101 --> 15:46.168
After all,

15:46.170 --> 15:48.119
look where it got you.

15:52.710 --> 15:55.911
Perhaps now you understand:

15:55.913 --> 15:58.047
family is a curse.

15:58.049 --> 16:00.649
We inherit the sins of
those who come before us,

16:00.651 --> 16:05.587
and those sins are passed
to the ones who come next.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.122
Like...

16:07.124 --> 16:09.525
your little niece.

16:09.527 --> 16:13.095
No! No!

16:13.097 --> 16:14.263
You will never...

16:14.265 --> 16:16.665
Hurt her? Why?

16:16.667 --> 16:18.566
Because your family will protect her?

16:18.569 --> 16:20.369
You poor soul.

16:20.371 --> 16:23.205
You can't even save each other.

16:23.207 --> 16:24.707
But your niece?

16:24.709 --> 16:27.009
She who's born of my bloodline?

16:27.011 --> 16:29.763
She has the power to destroy me,

16:29.766 --> 16:31.358
and that...

16:32.683 --> 16:35.150
I cannot allow.

17:00.044 --> 17:03.212
♪ ♪

17:05.782 --> 17:09.284
Mom?

17:09.286 --> 17:13.388
Hope. I didn't see you there, sweetie.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.093
Uncle Elijah is sick, isn't he?

17:23.034 --> 17:26.602
Uncle Elijah is very sick.

17:27.637 --> 17:31.240
Well, can we help him?

17:31.242 --> 17:34.176
We're doing everything that we can.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.345
I promise.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.882
Maybe I can help Aunt Freya
do a spell to make him better.

17:41.419 --> 17:44.119
That's very brave of you.

17:57.168 --> 17:59.334
So I went through Cami's logs.

17:59.336 --> 18:02.704
Even if we channel every
dark object that she had,

18:02.706 --> 18:04.873
it still wouldn't be
enough to trap the Hollow.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.443
Great. Well, my mother
had a million spells,

18:07.445 --> 18:09.912
and absolutely nothing on
trapping ancient spirits.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.715
It was funny to me, because, um...

18:13.717 --> 18:16.752
was it, five years ago, we
were in this exact same room,

18:16.754 --> 18:18.687
trying to work out a way to take out

18:18.689 --> 18:20.422
a different threat to your family.

18:20.424 --> 18:22.191
You made the call to take out Davina.

18:22.193 --> 18:24.193
In your mind, the ends justify
the means... I get that.

18:24.195 --> 18:25.494
But what am I to think now?

18:25.496 --> 18:26.895
Elijah's life is just worth more?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.464
Elijah's my brother.

18:28.466 --> 18:30.232
All right? And if you
think that I never regretted

18:30.234 --> 18:32.101
what we did to Davina,
then you're wrong.

18:32.103 --> 18:34.269
No. I think that we are
wasting our time here

18:34.271 --> 18:36.174
trying to loophole ourselves
out of the inevitable.

18:36.176 --> 18:38.340
Okay, well, I'm not giving up.

18:38.342 --> 18:40.109
Is it really giving up, though, Freya?

18:40.111 --> 18:41.977
Elijah's a thousand years old.

18:41.979 --> 18:43.812
How many lifetimes is gonna be enough?

18:43.814 --> 18:46.048
How much longer is he
going to feed off the blood

18:46.050 --> 18:48.050
of innocent people whose
lives amount to a fraction

18:48.052 --> 18:49.451
- of his own?
- I get it.

18:49.453 --> 18:51.153
Okay. You hate us.

18:51.155 --> 18:53.122
But that doesn't mean
that Elijah has to die

18:53.124 --> 18:56.024
stopping some beast that crawled
from the basement of your city.

18:56.026 --> 18:57.326
There's no other choice!

18:57.328 --> 19:00.262
We don't have any other option, Freya!

19:00.264 --> 19:02.965
You Mikaelsons, you're the oldest
family in the whole world.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.466
You're the oldest family of all time.

19:04.468 --> 19:05.834
You've seen empires rise.

19:05.836 --> 19:07.970
You've seen empires fall.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.271
You've seen ages begin and end.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.572
And yet somehow,

19:10.574 --> 19:12.207
despite every single thing you have seen

19:12.209 --> 19:15.577
with your own eyes, you fail...

19:15.579 --> 19:17.246
you fail to see the obvious.

19:17.248 --> 19:18.814
You don't get the takeaway.

19:18.816 --> 19:20.480
Everything dies, Freya!

19:20.483 --> 19:23.352
Not Elijah.

19:23.354 --> 19:25.053
Not today, okay?

19:25.055 --> 19:27.255
I already lost my brother Finn, and...

19:29.690 --> 19:31.290
Of course.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.730
That's it.

19:40.838 --> 19:42.271
I can save him.

19:42.273 --> 19:45.140
I can save him using this.

19:50.347 --> 19:54.249
FREYA: Vincent said the
Ancestors can imprison the Hollow.

19:54.251 --> 19:57.052
To power their spell,
an Original must die.

19:57.054 --> 20:00.980
If Elijah is going to
die one way or another,

20:00.983 --> 20:04.192
we should harness his
death, and then I can try

20:04.195 --> 20:06.161
placing his soul inside the pendant.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.196
Try? What do you mean, try?

20:07.198 --> 20:08.797
Well, it won't be easy.

20:08.799 --> 20:11.133
We have to find him, and
I'll need all of my magic.

20:11.135 --> 20:14.336
And Elijah's been poisoned
for some time, there's...

20:14.338 --> 20:16.838
a chance he won't survive the process.

20:20.843 --> 20:23.382
But I would survive.

20:23.385 --> 20:24.718
Klaus.

20:24.721 --> 20:26.847
If I'm the sacrifice,
you can channel my death

20:26.850 --> 20:28.083
to imprison the Hollow

20:28.085 --> 20:29.128
before she kills Elijah.

20:29.131 --> 20:30.597
Yes, I'll be in the pendant,

20:30.600 --> 20:31.987
but the rest of you
can find him, cure him,

20:31.989 --> 20:33.055
and bring him home.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.323
This is insane.

20:34.325 --> 20:37.159
That evil wench cannot be killed.

20:37.161 --> 20:39.027
Left unchecked, she will come for Hope.

20:40.431 --> 20:41.697
Sacrifice me,

20:41.699 --> 20:43.699
we can save Elijah and
we can defeat this thing.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.601
It's the only way.

20:54.612 --> 20:57.379
We don't have time to debate this.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.414
Work your magic, sister.

21:00.786 --> 21:02.786
It's gonna be okay.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.221
Is this the last of it?

21:24.223 --> 21:26.257
The cure you made using my venom?

21:26.259 --> 21:28.559
Assuming I get to Elijah on time,

21:28.562 --> 21:30.995
it should at least slow the
poison from the rosebush.

21:30.997 --> 21:33.497
But how are you gonna find
him? You said he was cloaked.

21:33.499 --> 21:35.211
This is Marcel's venom.

21:35.214 --> 21:37.201
That rosebush was born from his blood,

21:37.203 --> 21:39.270
which means it has the
same magical signature.

21:39.272 --> 21:41.914
So, while I can't trace Elijah,

21:41.917 --> 21:44.451
I can track the magic of the
thing that's killing him.

21:44.454 --> 21:46.744
Although finding him is not the same

21:46.746 --> 21:49.370
- as knowing what I'm walking into.
- Freya. Hey.

21:49.373 --> 21:51.576
- This all has to be perfect.
- Look at me.

21:52.985 --> 21:54.118
You're doing that thing

21:54.120 --> 21:55.486
where you put it all on you.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.087
Just stop.

21:57.089 --> 21:58.856
Take a breath.

21:58.858 --> 22:00.627
Focus.

22:00.630 --> 22:04.045
And know that if anyone
can do this, it's you.

22:04.931 --> 22:07.231
What if you're wrong?

22:07.233 --> 22:08.799
I'm never wrong.

22:08.801 --> 22:10.534
I'm a doctor.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.939
[chuckles]

22:14.941 --> 22:17.541
All right, just listen to me.

22:17.543 --> 22:20.711
This spirit, she's evil.

22:20.713 --> 22:22.913
And from what you said,
she goes back a long way,

22:22.915 --> 22:25.716
and if she really did
create the werewolf curse...

22:25.718 --> 22:27.418
I mean, that's what made me who I am,

22:27.420 --> 22:30.321
and my entire life I
have been fighting this.

22:30.323 --> 22:33.057
And believe me, I'd stab her
in the chest myself if I could,

22:33.059 --> 22:35.593
but since you need me here...

22:38.097 --> 22:41.565
Just do me a favor and watch yourself.

22:43.269 --> 22:46.337
And if you do get the chance,
don't hesitate, all right?

22:46.339 --> 22:48.706
Take this bitch down for good.

22:55.681 --> 22:57.581
[metallic scraping]

23:00.653 --> 23:02.119
Yeah.

23:02.121 --> 23:04.522
Stainless steel laced
with Hayley's blood.

23:04.524 --> 23:07.418
Now, you're gonna get one chance.

23:07.421 --> 23:10.055
Make sure you stab Sofya
directly in the heart.

23:10.058 --> 23:11.751
I assure you, it's not gonna kill her.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.797
It's just gonna drop the
Hollow's spirit out of her.

23:13.799 --> 23:18.002
Then I'll sacrifice Klaus and
put the Hollow away for good.

23:18.004 --> 23:19.837
All right, I got it.

23:19.839 --> 23:21.071
You think you got it.

23:21.073 --> 23:23.340
[sighs] This thing stole Elijah's blade,

23:23.342 --> 23:25.910
which means not only is it
wearing your girlfriend's face,

23:25.912 --> 23:27.611
but it's got the weapon
that can kill you.

23:27.613 --> 23:29.272
So, Marcel, if you're
not careful with it...

23:29.274 --> 23:31.782
Even if I am careful,
I'm in for a fight.

23:31.784 --> 23:33.384
I got it.

23:33.386 --> 23:34.919
And I'm ready.

23:45.698 --> 23:47.364
All right.

23:47.366 --> 23:49.166
It's been awhile since I played.

23:49.168 --> 23:51.502
You just bounce the
ball, pick up the jacks.

23:51.504 --> 23:53.504
That's it.

23:54.473 --> 23:55.606
[chuckles]

23:55.608 --> 23:58.175
Okay, I'll try.

24:01.658 --> 24:02.913
[chuckles]

24:02.915 --> 24:04.448
Nice one.

24:04.450 --> 24:08.118
Klaus... it's time.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.387
- [laughs]
- Wow. Really?

24:10.389 --> 24:13.324
Your girlfriend seems nice...

24:13.326 --> 24:15.659
for what it's worth.

24:15.661 --> 24:18.062
Kind of. Kind of did it.

24:18.064 --> 24:19.263
HOPE: Yep.

24:22.068 --> 24:23.500
[Hope laughs]

24:23.502 --> 24:25.936
HOPE: Now, try it again.

24:25.938 --> 24:28.439
KEELIN: Okay.

24:28.441 --> 24:30.541
[Hope laughs]

24:45.391 --> 24:47.324
Well, go on, your silence is deafening.

24:47.326 --> 24:48.325
Say it.

24:48.327 --> 24:49.693
Say what exactly?

24:49.695 --> 24:52.496
That my impending execution pleases you.

24:52.498 --> 24:54.064
There's no shame in taking pleasure

24:54.066 --> 24:56.066
in finally felling a long-standing foe.

24:56.068 --> 24:58.535
"The man who killed Klaus Mikaelson."

24:58.537 --> 25:01.038
That'll make a lovely
epitaph on your tombstone.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.474
May be engraved sooner than you think,

25:03.476 --> 25:05.009
if things don't go our way.

25:05.011 --> 25:07.678
The truth is, Klaus,

25:07.681 --> 25:09.681
I never thought I'd
live to see this day.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.443
See, growing up in New Orleans as kids,

25:12.446 --> 25:15.653
we-we hear stories about
the evil Klaus Mikaelson.

25:15.655 --> 25:19.390
Yes, yes, and now I'll
finally reap my just desserts.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.958
No.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.560
I was gonna say, here you are,

25:23.563 --> 25:27.613
finally living up to the
potential that Cami saw in you.

25:32.938 --> 25:35.105
She would've been proud.

25:46.552 --> 25:48.585
[sighs]

25:58.969 --> 26:01.136
SOFYA: The vampire, Marcel.

26:01.138 --> 26:03.082
Did you come here to witness my rebirth

26:03.085 --> 26:05.674
or to die trying to stop it?

26:05.676 --> 26:07.978
I didn't come to fight you.

26:07.981 --> 26:10.903
The truth is I'm a little jealous.

26:10.905 --> 26:14.807
See, you went to Vincent to
make a deal, but this is my city.

26:14.809 --> 26:16.509
I should be making the deals.

26:16.511 --> 26:20.346
And what deal did you come
to make, king of New Orleans?

26:20.348 --> 26:24.650
Are you here to bow and
swear your undying loyalty?

26:24.652 --> 26:25.885
Yeah, well, we'll get to that,

26:25.887 --> 26:27.787
but first let's talk about my terms.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.456
All right, I want Sofya back.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.258
A reasonable request.

26:32.260 --> 26:35.895
After all, this body will
soon be of no use to me.

26:35.897 --> 26:37.997
What do you have to offer in return?

26:38.900 --> 26:42.601
I got this from the Mikaelsons.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.904
And I'm willing to give
it to you as an offering,

26:44.906 --> 26:47.173
in exchange for my friend.

26:47.175 --> 26:48.774
Then you have a deal.

26:48.776 --> 26:51.043
And you're a wise king.

26:51.045 --> 26:54.613
Perhaps when this is
over, I will let you live.

27:01.656 --> 27:04.657
How much longer?

27:04.659 --> 27:06.091
We're almost there.

27:06.093 --> 27:08.994
All that's left is your death.

27:08.996 --> 27:11.030
Once I scratch you with the thorns,

27:11.032 --> 27:14.200
I'll stake you in the heart to
end things quick and painless.

27:15.636 --> 27:18.404
The Ancestors are gonna
help me with everything else.

27:19.907 --> 27:22.007
NATHANIEL: Might reconsider, Vincent.

27:22.009 --> 27:23.642
Or else your friend dies.

27:23.644 --> 27:25.811
Oh, you've got to be joking.

27:25.813 --> 27:26.979
Don't hesitate.

27:26.981 --> 27:28.814
Kill me now!

27:33.588 --> 27:37.523
Such small, frail things, these bones.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.658
They eluded me for so long.

27:39.660 --> 27:44.096
Now they will serve as the seeds
for everything that is to come.

27:45.366 --> 27:47.399
Sounds like you got big plans.

27:47.401 --> 27:49.568
For your city?

27:49.570 --> 27:51.203
In fact, I do.

27:51.205 --> 27:55.541
And why not? I was of this
land long before you existed.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.677
Imagine spending nturies in the cold,

27:58.679 --> 28:01.680
longing to once again feel this soil,

28:01.682 --> 28:03.382
to breathe this air,

28:03.384 --> 28:07.219
to sweat in the heat of its sun.

28:08.656 --> 28:12.625
All that remains is the sacrifice.

28:12.627 --> 28:14.894
If you're so eager to die, be patient.

28:14.896 --> 28:17.563
Once the Hollow rises,
she'll kill you herself.

28:17.565 --> 28:20.432
Man, you don't have to do this.

28:20.434 --> 28:22.468
I mean, we're all New
Orleans witches here, right?

28:22.470 --> 28:25.938
You talk of witches as you
make deals with vampires.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.307
It's 'cause of them
that we need the Hollow.

28:28.309 --> 28:30.976
Please, man, she is
never going to save you.

28:32.179 --> 28:34.146
She's just gonna damn you to hell.

29:15.990 --> 29:17.590
No!

29:22.997 --> 29:24.964
They're gone.

29:27.134 --> 29:29.768
I can't complete the
sacrifice without them.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.656

29:51.658 --> 29:53.758
selling your soul to the devil?

29:54.995 --> 29:58.129
[shouts]

What are you doing?

30:04.271 --> 30:06.505

just gonna let you die?

30:06.507 --> 30:07.806
No.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.241
Freya, you have to leave now.

30:09.243 --> 30:11.910
Stop talking.

30:11.912 --> 30:13.678
Save your strength.

30:15.082 --> 30:16.848
Can we break the barrier?

30:16.850 --> 30:18.783
It's old magic. We'll need time.

30:18.785 --> 30:20.118
Freya, don't do this.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.320
Brother, I'm not leaving you.

30:39.373 --> 30:42.407
Where is Niklaus?

30:46.980 --> 30:48.513
