WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:03.980
You're wrong.
No, I'm not.

00:03.982 --> 00:06.382
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

00:06.384 --> 00:08.384
Settle this. Those
little animated pictures

00:08.386 --> 00:11.020
on the Internet, are they
called "gifs" or "jifs"?

00:11.022 --> 00:12.622
Well, the G stands
for "graphics."

00:12.624 --> 00:14.524
That's a hard G,
so I'd say "gif."

00:14.526 --> 00:17.460
W... The guy who invented
it says it's "jif."

00:17.462 --> 00:21.130
I'm sorry, do you mean
the <i> guy</i> or the <i> juy?</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:24.234
Well, I'll give you
three guesses

00:24.236 --> 00:26.236
why I'm so irritated.

00:26.238 --> 00:29.973
Something happened different
from the way you wanted it.

00:30.809 --> 00:32.942
I guess news travels fast.

00:34.045 --> 00:35.745
It's true,
a select group of scientists

00:35.747 --> 00:37.413
was invited
to a weekend symposium

00:37.415 --> 00:39.382
at a former home
of Richard Feynman,

00:39.384 --> 00:41.017
and I wasn't included.

00:41.019 --> 00:43.586
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's
not because they don't think

00:43.588 --> 00:45.455
you're an elite scientist.
Yeah,

00:45.457 --> 00:49.025
I bet you anything it's
just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.

00:49.027 --> 00:52.328
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

00:53.365 --> 00:55.198
Look, you can spend
the rest of the day

00:55.200 --> 00:57.967
being bitter about this.
Agreed.

00:57.969 --> 01:01.037
I was gonna say "or,"
but why bother?

01:30.521 --> 01:31.954
Hey, Raj.

01:31.956 --> 01:34.590
Hey, I got you
a little gift.

01:34.592 --> 01:37.159
Oh, that's a lot
of Girl Scout Cookies.

01:37.161 --> 01:39.027
You know me.
I'm from India.

01:39.029 --> 01:41.196
I can't resist children begging.

01:42.299 --> 01:44.733
So, how's it going
with the title to the house?

01:44.735 --> 01:45.667
Great, it's all done.

01:45.669 --> 01:46.735
The lawyer
tracked down my father

01:46.737 --> 01:48.237
and got him to sign it over.

01:48.239 --> 01:49.938
I didn't have to meet him,
I didn't have to talk to him,

01:49.940 --> 01:51.573
I don't even know where he is.

01:51.575 --> 01:54.576
Wow, so you're not curious
at all?

01:54.578 --> 01:55.677
Nope.

01:55.679 --> 01:57.279
Hm. What if he's in prison?

01:57.281 --> 01:59.047
What if he's a spy?

01:59.049 --> 02:01.884
What if he's
in a Beatles cover band?

02:03.053 --> 02:05.220
I'm just saying, if he's got
your nose and haircut,

02:05.222 --> 02:07.389
he'd make a killer Ringo.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.460
Thanks again for
agreeing to do this.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.929
Oh, it's cool; I've never been
on a podcast before.

02:13.931 --> 02:15.898
Well, you picked
a good one to start.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.165
Wil's had lots of great guests.

02:17.167 --> 02:18.834
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,

02:18.836 --> 02:21.303
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden...

02:21.305 --> 02:23.338
Those are <i> Star Trek</i> people.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.439
Yes!

02:24.441 --> 02:25.507
I only figured that out

02:25.509 --> 02:27.209
because I've never heard
of any of them.

02:28.279 --> 02:29.611
I deserve that.

02:29.613 --> 02:32.681
I invited you on my show
and I drove here.

02:32.683 --> 02:33.849
Sorry.

02:33.851 --> 02:35.384
Okay, so, this is
basically gonna be

02:35.386 --> 02:36.785
just like a little talk show.

02:36.787 --> 02:38.320
Uh, we're gonna take some calls,

02:38.322 --> 02:40.022
we'll talk about what
it was like on the set

02:40.024 --> 02:41.256
of <i> Serial Ape-ist 2.</i>

02:41.258 --> 02:42.291
It should be really fun.

02:42.293 --> 02:43.759
This is exciting.
Yeah.

02:43.761 --> 02:44.960
So, how many people listen?

02:44.962 --> 02:46.228
Most people download it later,

02:46.230 --> 02:48.297
but usually a few thousand
people listen live.

02:48.299 --> 02:50.265
What?! A few thousand people

02:50.267 --> 02:52.868
listen to you talk
about nerd stuff?

02:54.138 --> 02:56.371
Again, right in the ears,

02:56.373 --> 02:58.307
straight to the feelings.

03:01.245 --> 03:02.978
Can you please pass the salt?

03:02.980 --> 03:04.780
Sure.

03:04.782 --> 03:07.583
It's not like I was invited
to Richard Feynman's house

03:07.585 --> 03:10.018
and have anything better to do.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.955
Is this how the rest
of the night's going to be?

03:12.957 --> 03:15.257
I don't know the future.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.493
Do you think there's a chance

03:18.495 --> 03:20.495
that an asteroid
could hit the Earth,

03:20.497 --> 03:23.966
destroying Feynman's house
and everyone in it?

03:23.968 --> 03:26.134
No, Sheldon.

03:26.136 --> 03:29.471
Then buckle up;
you're in for a cranky night.

03:29.473 --> 03:32.341
According to the codicil
of the Relationship Agreement

03:32.343 --> 03:33.809
which you insisted upon,

03:33.811 --> 03:36.445
we're not allowed to pout
or be moody on date night.

03:36.447 --> 03:40.582
You know I just put that in
because of uterus stuff.

03:41.685 --> 03:44.052
Well, it applies to you, too.

03:44.054 --> 03:46.855
I was afraid you might
bring this up,

03:46.857 --> 03:50.025
so I have a work-around.

03:54.698 --> 03:56.898
There you go.

04:01.939 --> 04:04.706
As far as you're concerned,
I'm smiling.

04:06.076 --> 04:07.976
Although, I must admit,
I'm smiling a little bit

04:07.978 --> 04:10.312
at the moment because
this loophole is so brilliant.

04:12.983 --> 04:14.516
So, Bernadette, have you thought

04:14.518 --> 04:16.785
about how you're going
to redecorate this place?

04:16.786 --> 04:18.754
You know, I'm thinking

04:18.755 --> 04:20.255
ripping up the carpets,

04:20.257 --> 04:21.990
maybe lose the wallpaper,

04:21.992 --> 04:23.325
all new light fixtures...

04:23.327 --> 04:25.160
You know,
if you knocked out this wall,

04:25.162 --> 04:26.895
it would give you an
open floor plan,

04:26.897 --> 04:31.033
and then-- it's a little scary,
but could be fun--

04:31.035 --> 04:34.036
indoor fire pit.

04:34.038 --> 04:35.504
(doorbell rings)

04:35.506 --> 04:37.939
Hey, I grew up
in this house, okay?

04:37.941 --> 04:40.542
No one's knocking anything down.

04:40.544 --> 04:42.177
Okay, okay.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.512
When he's at Comic-Con,

04:43.514 --> 04:46.348
I'm bringing in
a wrecking ball.

04:48.786 --> 04:49.751
Can I help you?

04:49.753 --> 04:52.087
Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?

04:52.089 --> 04:53.655
Yes.

04:53.657 --> 04:55.357
Um, this is a little weird,

04:55.359 --> 04:57.492
but a lawyer was trying
to contact my father,

04:57.494 --> 05:00.095
because his name was still
on the title for this house.

05:00.097 --> 05:02.531
W... uh, who's your father?

05:02.533 --> 05:04.399
Sam Wolowitz.

05:04.401 --> 05:05.901
(chuckles)

05:05.903 --> 05:08.370
S-Sam Wolowitz is my father.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.272
I know.

05:10.274 --> 05:14.242
Well, wait, so if we have
the same father...

05:14.244 --> 05:15.277
I mean,

05:15.279 --> 05:16.545
are you saying

05:16.547 --> 05:17.547
you're my half-brother?

05:17.548 --> 05:19.381
I think so.

05:19.383 --> 05:20.649
(chuckles)

05:20.651 --> 05:23.685
Bernadette, weird things
are happening out here!

05:26.657 --> 05:28.990
I think I started to suspect
it was a bad movie

05:28.992 --> 05:32.894
when I looked at the script
and saw the title,

05:32.896 --> 05:35.530
<i>Serial Ape-ist 2:</i>

05:35.532 --> 05:38.533
<i>Monkey See, Monkey Kill.</i>

05:38.535 --> 05:39.868
Uh, spoiler alert:

05:39.870 --> 05:42.571
after the monkey sees, it kills.

05:42.573 --> 05:44.773
Psst.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.508
I've just been handed a note.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.777
I'm going to read it.

05:48.779 --> 05:52.114
"Wil, do you want
more Diet Coke?

05:53.050 --> 05:56.151
Also, we have juice."

05:57.588 --> 06:00.155
I-I didn't want to interrupt.

06:01.258 --> 06:02.791
Uh, that voice you just heard

06:02.793 --> 06:04.626
belongs to Leonard,
Penny's fiancé.

06:04.628 --> 06:06.628
Uh, Leonard, why don't you grab
some headphones and join us?

06:06.630 --> 06:08.163
Really?
Yeah.

06:08.165 --> 06:09.498
(chuckles) Yeah, great.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.333
So, while Leonard
gets set up,

06:11.335 --> 06:12.901
let's take a call.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.469
Hello, caller, you are on

06:14.471 --> 06:16.905
with Penny and Wil
from <i> Serial Ape-ist 2.</i>

06:16.907 --> 06:18.173
WOMAN:
I don't have a question.

06:18.175 --> 06:20.308
I just want to say
I'm a big fan of the movie.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.877
I've seen it, like, ten times.

06:21.879 --> 06:24.312
Okay, well, I'll apologize
for the first time,

06:24.314 --> 06:26.581
but the other nine are on you.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.150
(chuckles)

06:28.152 --> 06:29.518
Thanks a lot, caller.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.920
You know that the movie
actually has

06:30.921 --> 06:32.053
a little bit
of a cult following.

06:32.055 --> 06:33.221
Really?
Yeah.

06:33.223 --> 06:34.556
I was at
a science-fiction convention,

06:34.558 --> 06:37.893
and I saw a woman dressed
as your half-ape character.

06:37.895 --> 06:39.294
Oh, if she was

06:39.296 --> 06:41.463
with an Indian guy dressed
like a banana,

06:41.465 --> 06:44.199
that was just my friends,
Howard and Raj.

06:45.335 --> 06:47.769
All right, it's time
for a very special guest caller,

06:47.771 --> 06:49.371
a friend of mine,
who you probably know

06:49.373 --> 06:51.773
as the director
of such movies as <i> Clerks,</i>

06:51.775 --> 06:53.441
or from podcasts and books

06:53.443 --> 06:55.210
where he often reminds you
that he's the guy

06:55.212 --> 06:56.378
who directed <i> Clerks.</i>

06:56.380 --> 06:57.746
Hello, Kevin Smith.

06:57.748 --> 06:59.681
KEVIN: Hey, man,
yo, is everything okay, Wil?

06:59.683 --> 07:01.750
'Cause it's been,
like, two minutes

07:01.752 --> 07:04.653
and you haven't even brought up
<i>Stand By Me.</i>

07:06.290 --> 07:07.556
Hey, Kevin!

07:07.558 --> 07:09.157
It's really exciting
to talk to you.

07:09.159 --> 07:10.325
It really is.

07:10.327 --> 07:12.360
Oh, you guys are very sweet.
So, Penny, listen,

07:12.362 --> 07:13.695
I saw your movie.

07:13.697 --> 07:15.831
Oh, wow. I wish it was better.

07:15.833 --> 07:16.898
Oh, don't worry about it.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.867
Have you seen some
of Kevin's films?

07:19.970 --> 07:22.637
You're cruisin'
for a beatin', Wheaton.

07:24.174 --> 07:25.907
Anyway, man,
I dug the ape movie, Penny.

07:25.909 --> 07:27.876
And I thought you were, like,
really great in it.

07:27.878 --> 07:29.044
Aw.

07:29.046 --> 07:30.212
You know, I'm in the movie, too.

07:30.214 --> 07:31.813
Yeah, whatever. Penny!

07:31.815 --> 07:35.317
Penny, how come you're not
in more stuff, man?

07:35.319 --> 07:36.518
I'd cast you in a minute.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.420
Seriously?
Oh, yeah, man.

07:38.422 --> 07:40.255
I'm actually in pre-production
on a movie right now.

07:40.257 --> 07:41.356
Way different

07:41.358 --> 07:42.724
than anything I've ever
done before.

07:42.726 --> 07:45.060
It's called <i> Clerks 3.</i>

07:45.062 --> 07:46.595
You should come over

07:46.597 --> 07:48.396
and read for a part.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.599
Oh, my, I would love that.

07:50.601 --> 07:52.000
You have a new job.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.635
Well, maybe I can do both.

07:53.637 --> 07:56.104
I don't think you can do both.

07:56.106 --> 07:58.440
I don't think I asked you.

07:58.442 --> 08:00.275
Yeah, you tell him, Penny.

08:01.578 --> 08:04.679
Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

08:05.849 --> 08:08.149
Do you think there comes
a point in life

08:08.151 --> 08:11.353
when it stops feeling bad
to be left out of things?

08:11.355 --> 08:12.754
Probably not.

08:12.756 --> 08:14.856
It's an evolutionary advantage

08:14.858 --> 08:17.025
to be included
in group activities.

08:17.027 --> 08:18.593
You know what?

08:18.595 --> 08:20.595
I used to be a fan of evolution,

08:20.597 --> 08:22.330
but I've since evolved,

08:22.332 --> 08:24.900
and now I think it's dumb.

08:26.003 --> 08:27.702
Being left out
is a terrible feeling.

08:27.704 --> 08:29.804
No one understands that
better than I do.

08:29.806 --> 08:31.640
Hey, look at that.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.743
Even in your example,
you're all by yourself.

08:36.513 --> 08:38.746
When there was
a lice epidemic at my school,

08:38.749 --> 08:40.582
everybody got it except me.

08:40.583 --> 08:43.418
I tried to fool everyone
by sprinkling sugar in my hair,

08:43.419 --> 08:46.821
but I just got attacked by bees.

08:47.925 --> 08:49.891
I can just picture
them all right now

08:49.893 --> 08:51.126
at Feynman's house,

08:51.128 --> 08:52.327
probably discussing Schrodinger

08:52.329 --> 08:54.329
and at the same time,

08:54.331 --> 08:56.665
not discussing Schrodinger.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.233
See?

08:58.235 --> 09:02.170
They're missing out
on hilarious jokes like that.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.372
And at the same time, not.

09:06.009 --> 09:08.076
It reminds me of when
my stupid brother and sister

09:08.078 --> 09:09.711
would build forts
in the living room

09:09.713 --> 09:11.313
and wouldn't let me in.

09:11.315 --> 09:13.949
I hated that so much.

09:13.951 --> 09:16.184
You know,

09:16.186 --> 09:17.385
there's nothing I can do

09:17.387 --> 09:19.287
about getting you invited
to the symposium,

09:19.289 --> 09:21.456
but if you wanted...

09:21.458 --> 09:23.358
we could build a fort.

09:24.194 --> 09:26.294
Isn't that a little juvenile?

09:26.296 --> 09:28.463
More juvenile than this?

09:32.035 --> 09:33.168
I'll get the blankets.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.869
You Google how
to have childlike fun.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.075
You know what,
I'm being a bad host.

09:40.077 --> 09:41.276
Let me get some more coffee.

09:41.278 --> 09:43.678
Oh, let me do it, Howard.
No, I got it.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.615
So, Josh, what do you do?

09:47.617 --> 09:49.951
I'm studying oceanography
down in San Diego.

09:49.953 --> 09:52.153
Oh, how nice.

09:55.892 --> 09:58.560
I loved <i> Finding Nemo.</i>

09:59.496 --> 10:00.562
Enough chitchat.

10:00.564 --> 10:02.263
How do we know you are
who you say you are?

10:02.265 --> 10:04.599
Why would I lie?

10:04.601 --> 10:06.901
Okay, you got me there.

10:08.005 --> 10:10.572
You here looking for money?
No.

10:10.574 --> 10:13.041
A kidney, cornea,
piece of his liver?

10:13.043 --> 10:14.409
No.

10:14.411 --> 10:16.277
You're in a Beatles cover band

10:16.279 --> 10:19.547
and you need Howard to replace
your dad as Ringo.

10:20.984 --> 10:22.851
Why don't you help
with the coffee?

10:22.853 --> 10:25.820
Okay, but something
smells fishy.

10:25.822 --> 10:26.855
And not just because

10:26.857 --> 10:28.323
you work around sea animals.

10:29.292 --> 10:30.458
That actually
sounds interesting,

10:30.460 --> 10:32.160
and I'd like
to learn more about it.

10:34.831 --> 10:36.364
Hey, you okay?

10:36.366 --> 10:37.899
Not really.

10:37.901 --> 10:40.502
This guy shows up
out of the blue,

10:40.504 --> 10:42.070
and now I have a brother?

10:42.072 --> 10:45.340
My father has another family?

10:45.342 --> 10:47.175
I get it.

10:47.177 --> 10:48.977
What do you want to do?

10:48.979 --> 10:50.979
I don't know. I...

10:50.981 --> 10:52.814
I'd just like him to go away.

10:52.816 --> 10:54.482
I can't deal with this.

10:54.484 --> 10:56.451
All right, I've got your back.

10:56.453 --> 10:58.620
Thank you. Come on.

11:00.023 --> 11:01.189
And I'd like to point out

11:01.191 --> 11:04.526
this wall just provided
a lot of privacy!

11:06.463 --> 11:08.063
I can't believe
my brother's an astronaut.

11:08.065 --> 11:09.964
That's amazing.  What was it like?
Listen, dude,

11:09.966 --> 11:11.266
it's time for you
to hit the road.

11:11.268 --> 11:13.735
Hey, hey, the young man asked
a good question.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:22.709 --> 11:24.242
So, for those of you
just tuning in,

11:24.244 --> 11:25.576
we are listening

11:25.578 --> 11:27.945
to a really fun fight between my costar...
No, no, no.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.180
We're not fighting;
we're just...

11:29.182 --> 11:30.615
having a conversation.

11:30.617 --> 11:32.316
All right.

11:32.318 --> 11:35.186
We're listening
to a really fun <i> conversation</i>

11:35.188 --> 11:38.356
between my costar
from <i> Serial Ape-ist 2</i>

11:38.358 --> 11:40.024
and her fiancé,
who doesn't believe

11:40.026 --> 11:42.526
women should have dreams.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.632
Give me back that juice.

11:48.568 --> 11:50.434
What is the harm
if I audition?

11:50.436 --> 11:51.836
Well, what if you get it?

11:51.838 --> 11:53.938
I don't know, I make a movie,

11:53.940 --> 11:55.573
become rich and famous,

11:55.575 --> 11:56.774
win an Oscar, a Golden Globe

11:56.776 --> 11:58.809
and live an incredibly
wonderful life.

11:58.811 --> 12:01.512
From a Kevin Smith movie?

12:02.582 --> 12:04.882
KEVIN:
Oh, I'm hanging up now.

12:04.884 --> 12:06.250
Don't you listen
to him, buddy.

12:06.252 --> 12:07.485
You're awesome.

12:07.487 --> 12:09.487
You're one of the greatest
directors of our time.

12:09.489 --> 12:12.189
I don't have
a part for you, Wheaton.

12:12.992 --> 12:14.992
And that was Kevin Smith.

12:14.994 --> 12:17.361
Thanks a lot.

12:17.363 --> 12:18.963
I'm just trying to protect you.

12:18.965 --> 12:21.232
How many times did I see you
get your heart broken

12:21.234 --> 12:23.067
trying to make it
as an actress?

12:23.069 --> 12:24.702
Okay, instead of protecting me,
why don't you try

12:24.704 --> 12:26.504
being excited when
something good happens?

12:26.506 --> 12:28.773
I'm always excited for you!

12:28.775 --> 12:30.508
I'm excited that you found
this new job

12:30.510 --> 12:31.976
where you're making
decent money.

12:31.978 --> 12:34.178
Decent? I make twice
what you make.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.880
Wait, twice?!

12:35.882 --> 12:37.548
Yeah.

12:37.550 --> 12:41.218
Like, "times two" twice?

12:42.288 --> 12:44.355
For those of you at home,
Leonard just found out

12:44.357 --> 12:47.591
his fiancée makes
way more money than he does.

12:47.593 --> 12:49.994
Let's listen.

12:49.996 --> 12:51.963
I went to school
for half my life.

12:51.965 --> 12:53.030
I have a doctorate.

12:53.032 --> 12:55.700
I'm still paying off
college loans.

12:55.702 --> 12:56.801
Well, how much do you owe?

12:56.803 --> 12:58.903
Maybe I can help you out.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.908
Wil, can we just turn off
the podcast for a little bit?

13:03.910 --> 13:05.376
For those of you at home,

13:05.378 --> 13:07.678
I am shaking my head "no."

13:15.088 --> 13:16.487
How's it going, Sheldon?

13:16.489 --> 13:19.190
Wonderful!

13:20.026 --> 13:22.193
I just finished
hanging the lights.

13:22.195 --> 13:23.394
Can I come in?

13:23.396 --> 13:25.262
Yes, oh,
but enter through the side.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.332
Batman is
a load-bearing blanket.

13:32.538 --> 13:34.638
Amazing.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.140
I know.

13:36.142 --> 13:37.508
This isn't the printout.

13:37.510 --> 13:39.410
This is my real face.

13:40.513 --> 13:42.013
What are we doing?

13:42.015 --> 13:43.314
This is a fort.

13:43.316 --> 13:45.783
Let's sit on the floor.

13:45.785 --> 13:47.952
Roughing it? Okay.

13:50.189 --> 13:51.689
(gasps)

13:51.691 --> 13:54.892
Everything looks
so big from down here.

13:56.162 --> 13:59.397
This must be
how Leonard feels.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.335
I'm surprised
you could hear me

14:04.337 --> 14:06.404
with this Thin Mint
in your ear!

14:06.406 --> 14:07.805
(laughs)

14:07.807 --> 14:09.473
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

14:09.475 --> 14:10.441
Yeah.

14:10.443 --> 14:14.378
Anyway,
I should probably get going.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.713
Howie, have you
noticed how often

14:15.715 --> 14:18.482
people say that
when you start to do magic?

14:19.152 --> 14:21.685
Sorry, I have a long drive.

14:21.687 --> 14:24.522
Well, I hope I get
to see you again.

14:24.524 --> 14:26.123
(chuckles)
I hope so, too.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.960
I've always dreamed of having
a brother to play catch with.

14:30.797 --> 14:32.630
Keep dreaming.

14:33.332 --> 14:34.665
Hey, I threw out the first pitch

14:34.667 --> 14:36.534
at an Angels game.
Wow.

14:36.536 --> 14:39.270
He did it with a robot.

14:40.073 --> 14:42.973
You had sex with a robot?

14:42.975 --> 14:45.142
That's not what she meant.

14:45.144 --> 14:46.777
But technically, yes.

14:49.482 --> 14:50.981
Hang on, if you're making
all this money,

14:50.983 --> 14:52.616
where is it?

14:52.618 --> 14:53.751
In a safe place.

14:53.753 --> 14:55.286
What does that mean,
under your bed?

14:55.288 --> 14:56.654
No, it means

14:56.656 --> 14:59.023
a diversified portfolio
of stocks and bonds.

14:59.025 --> 15:00.424
I'm not overly conservative.

15:00.426 --> 15:04.061
I'm young, so my guy said I
can afford to take some risks.

15:04.063 --> 15:06.664
Wait a minute, you have "a guy"?

15:06.666 --> 15:07.965
Don't you have a guy?

15:07.967 --> 15:11.202
Why would I have a guy?
I don't have any money!

15:11.871 --> 15:13.170
Oh, sweetie,

15:13.172 --> 15:15.606
you should really
get some money.

15:15.608 --> 15:17.842
For those of you listening
at home,

15:17.844 --> 15:20.845
how great is this?

15:20.847 --> 15:23.647
Wil, I'm begging you,
just please turn that off.

15:23.649 --> 15:26.283
Sure.

15:26.285 --> 15:28.352
And we're back.

15:28.354 --> 15:31.755
Leonard, why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

15:31.757 --> 15:34.391
So our roles have changed a bit
over the last couple years.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.759
This is the way life is.

15:35.761 --> 15:38.028
And I'm sure in time
they'll change again.

15:38.030 --> 15:41.298
Great, you're not only
more successful than me,

15:41.300 --> 15:43.367
now you're more mature.

15:43.369 --> 15:45.569
Okay, look, would it
make you feel better

15:45.571 --> 15:48.873
if I did something dumb like
sneak out of work one day

15:48.875 --> 15:51.509
to go audition for
a Kevin Smith movie?

15:51.511 --> 15:53.844
That would be great, thank you!

15:55.047 --> 15:56.413
I'm just gonna jump
in here real quick.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.882
Leonard, a moment ago,

15:57.884 --> 16:01.118
you were dead set against Penny
resuming her acting career,

16:01.120 --> 16:02.620
but now you're all for it.

16:02.622 --> 16:05.990
Is it fair to say that
she played you like a violin?

16:07.193 --> 16:09.493
Yes, it is, Wil.

16:12.131 --> 16:14.165
So, I have to ask,

16:14.167 --> 16:16.567
was the robot sexy?

16:16.569 --> 16:18.669
(chuckles)
It was actually

16:18.671 --> 16:21.438
just a mechanical hand.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.708
'Cause that's all
you need, right?

16:25.845 --> 16:27.178
You are my brother.

16:29.315 --> 16:31.882
Okay, so the final four forts

16:31.884 --> 16:34.451
in the first annual
best fort ever contest,

16:34.453 --> 16:36.520
or "fort off," are...

16:37.657 --> 16:38.956
...Fort Knox,

16:38.958 --> 16:40.424
Fort Ticonderoga,

16:40.426 --> 16:42.927
Fort Sumter and...

16:42.929 --> 16:45.196
Fort Cozy McBlanket.

16:46.532 --> 16:47.798
I'd say...

16:47.800 --> 16:49.767
Knox over Ticonderoga

16:49.769 --> 16:50.868
'cause it's got the gold.

16:50.870 --> 16:52.770
Mm-hmm.
And McBlanket over Sumter

16:52.772 --> 16:55.573
'cause it has
a higher thread count.

16:56.309 --> 16:58.275
(phone rings)
Oh.

16:58.277 --> 17:00.978
10:00.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.146
Date night's over.

17:02.148 --> 17:03.414
Wait, no.

17:03.416 --> 17:04.915
We haven't picked a winner.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.384
We both know
this one's gonna win.

17:07.386 --> 17:09.153
Well, of course we do.

17:09.155 --> 17:10.921
Fort Knox doesn't have a secret

17:10.923 --> 17:13.089
physics lending library.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.227
Come on, I'll help
you take this down.

17:16.229 --> 17:17.294
Well, wait.

17:17.296 --> 17:19.363
What if, just this once,

17:19.365 --> 17:21.699
we suspend
the date night parameters

17:21.701 --> 17:24.468
and you stay later?

17:26.305 --> 17:30.341
Well, as long as we're
suspending the parameters,

17:30.343 --> 17:31.942
I could stay really late

17:31.944 --> 17:35.312
and we could have
our first sleepover.

17:35.314 --> 17:37.615
That's a big step.

17:37.617 --> 17:40.784
It's a big fort.

17:42.388 --> 17:43.988
Very well.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.824
I will agree
to a family-friendly,

17:46.826 --> 17:49.627
G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.

17:51.664 --> 17:52.963
PG.

17:52.965 --> 17:56.400
Some scenes may be too intense
for younger viewers.

17:56.402 --> 17:58.636
G-rated,

17:58.638 --> 18:01.739
with a warning for families
with babies and toddlers.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.876
You got yourself a sleepover.

18:07.146 --> 18:08.412
Do you need to borrow

18:08.414 --> 18:09.780
a toothbrush or pajamas?

18:09.782 --> 18:11.749
Would it alarm you to know

18:11.751 --> 18:14.485
that I hid those things here
two years ago

18:14.487 --> 18:16.720
just in case this ever came up?

18:18.958 --> 18:20.190
It would,

18:20.192 --> 18:23.127
but you know how much
I admire preparedness.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.530
How did you know we'd be
in the living room?

18:26.532 --> 18:29.366
Who says this is
the only one I hid?

18:42.877 --> 18:45.043
Hello? What is this?

18:45.045 --> 18:47.679
We built a fort!

18:47.681 --> 18:49.882
Are those my sheets?

18:49.884 --> 18:52.217
Yes, they are.

18:52.219 --> 18:53.619
Okay.

18:53.621 --> 18:55.320
Well, you kids have fun.

18:55.322 --> 18:56.655
I'm gonna go to sleep.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.291
Leonard, don't you want to see
the inside of the fort?

18:59.293 --> 19:00.592
Yeah, I'm good.

19:00.594 --> 19:01.927
Oh, come on.

19:01.929 --> 19:04.096
I really wanted to tell someone
they can't come in.

19:04.098 --> 19:05.797
Okay, fine.

19:05.799 --> 19:08.934
Sheldon, may I please
visit your fort?

19:08.936 --> 19:10.469
I want to say no,

19:10.471 --> 19:12.271
but it's too glorious.
Get in here!
