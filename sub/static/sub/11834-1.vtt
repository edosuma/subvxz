WEBVTT

00:30.731 --> 00:32.566
We have one last pre-trial,

00:32.598 --> 00:35.235
where I'll try to suppress
your statement.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.803
Scott,
if I'm unsuccessful --

00:36.837 --> 00:38.238
No, no, no.

00:38.271 --> 00:41.241
Now, I'm not taking
manslaughter, bobby.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.276
Please don't ask me
that again!

00:46.880 --> 00:51.552
I'm sorry, man.
It's just getting to me.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.188
Okay. You understand
the risks?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.657
I do.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.226
So, what?
We go in the morning...

01:00.260 --> 01:02.596
we argue the motion,
trial starts after lunch.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.598
Eugene will be with me.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.732
Okay.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.435
Hey, man,
I keep having this --

01:09.469 --> 01:11.838
the dream
where everybody wakes up

01:11.872 --> 01:13.707
and comes to their senses.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.611
Karen's even in it.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.380
And she's not dead.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.583
We have a solid shot

01:22.616 --> 01:25.485
if we can shut down
this videotape.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.692
Oh, here you go.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.426
See this?

01:33.459 --> 01:35.161
Fiji.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.531
That's where I'm going

01:37.564 --> 01:39.800
when I walk out
of that courthouse.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.668
I'm going right
to a travel agent.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.706
In 10 days, I'll be sitting
on that beach.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.878
Look at me, Scott.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.216
Look at me.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.321
If that videotape is admitted,

02:01.354 --> 02:04.691
I believe
you will be convicted...

02:04.725 --> 02:08.161
probably
of second-degree murder.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.632
Now, that carries
a life sentence.

02:14.835 --> 02:19.172
You will not
be going to Fiji.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.643
Do you get that?

02:28.448 --> 02:30.283
â™ª (theme)

03:26.607 --> 03:28.509
They're inside.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.744
Okay.

03:30.777 --> 03:34.648
This thing was built
to bring children joy...

03:34.681 --> 03:36.650
and it's toxic.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.918
Come on.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.356
The fact that they called
for the meeting --

03:43.389 --> 03:44.658
that they're
coming to us --

03:44.691 --> 03:45.759
it's a very good sign.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.628
How much?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.763
We have no idea.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.998
Nothing is good enough
for what they did to our kids.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.466
Of course not,

03:53.499 --> 03:55.368
but you have to remember
if we go to trial,

03:55.401 --> 03:57.003
we will want your son
to take the stand

03:57.037 --> 03:58.371
and talk about his seizures,

03:58.404 --> 03:59.673
we'll need your daughter

03:59.706 --> 04:01.007
to talk about
her motor problems,

04:01.041 --> 04:02.843
and your youngest son

04:02.876 --> 04:05.045
may have to discuss
his learning disabilities

04:05.078 --> 04:07.480
and the humiliation
that he suffered.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.516
We've talked to them, Ellenor.
They're ready.

04:09.550 --> 04:13.520
The number Ellenor and I
think is reasonable

04:13.554 --> 04:15.656
is $160,000 per child.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.490
It seems low.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.692
Of course,
nothing can make up

04:19.726 --> 04:21.494
for your children's injuries,

04:21.528 --> 04:23.530
but the present-day value
of that

04:23.564 --> 04:26.800
is probably around $240,000
if you figure in an appeal

04:26.833 --> 04:30.871
and, given our problems
proving liability,

04:30.904 --> 04:33.039
that would be
an excellent settlement.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.509
We're not sure
we can get that,

04:35.542 --> 04:37.277
but that's our number.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.090
What, you think
I killed her?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.792
What are you -- crazy?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.628
HELEN: I don't think
you intended to kill her,

04:54.661 --> 04:55.696
I really don't.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.797
So what are you saying?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.565
LARSON: Mr. Wallace,

04:58.599 --> 05:02.002
things will go much better
for you if you cooperate.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.571
We think you had
an argument.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.708
You hit her,
maybe by accident.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.375
She was unconscious.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.712
You were afraid
of how it might look.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.547
You put her in the car

05:13.580 --> 05:16.817
to make it look
like a suicide.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.753
That's what happened,
isn't it?

05:32.432 --> 05:34.400
My client was in shock

05:34.434 --> 05:36.603
at the time
of this interrogation.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.038
He had just
found his wife dead

05:38.071 --> 05:39.873
less than an hour
before this.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.874
First of all,
he was read his rights.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.375
It isn't about that.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.110
He was suffering
severe traumatic distress.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.779
He wasn't fully processing

05:45.812 --> 05:47.480
all the stuff
being thrown at him here,

05:47.514 --> 05:49.850
and that tape
makes it look like

05:49.883 --> 05:52.118
he was acquiescing
to something when he wasn't.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.554
He was just under shock.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.921
You can certainly argue that,
counsel.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.523
Your honor,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.491
if the jury sees that tape,
the prejudice alone --

05:58.525 --> 05:59.760
he certainly had
the presence of mind

05:59.793 --> 06:01.127
to give us a nice coherent

06:01.161 --> 06:03.129
exculpatory version
of the events.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.531
He gave you the truth.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.866
All right.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.134
I'll allow the videotape

06:08.168 --> 06:10.504
for impeachment purposes only.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.606
Your honor,
that will effectively

06:12.639 --> 06:13.674
prevent my client
from testifying.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.576
It does no such thing.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.512
It only means if he testifies,
he does so with some risk of --

06:18.545 --> 06:19.880
I object to this!

06:19.913 --> 06:22.448
Your objection is noted.
The ruling is final.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.917
(gavel pounds)

06:27.087 --> 06:28.822
Offer's still good.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.824
No, thanks.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.932
If you take the stand,
the tape comes in,

06:38.965 --> 06:40.200
and I don't know
how we win this

06:40.233 --> 06:42.569
without you
getting in that chair.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.070
I can explain that tape.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.673
I-it was like you said.
I was in shock.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.142
Now, I can convince
the jury of that.

06:49.175 --> 06:53.079
I'm going to recommend
manslaughter one last time.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.416
No.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.955
I have one other idea.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.225
A polygraph?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.927
I'm willing to box him.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.929
If we both stipulate
to the admissibility,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.497
the judge will allow us
to introduce the results.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.867
Bobby, do I have the word "dope"
stamped on my forehead,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.503
or is it just
that you know me?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.204
Obviously,
if you've come to us

07:18.238 --> 07:20.040
asking that we give your client
a lie detector,

07:20.073 --> 07:22.108
you've already given him one
and he passed.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.577
We've given him five,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.145
with four different
technicians,

07:25.178 --> 07:26.780
and he's passed every one.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.515
He took it five times?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.584
And passed every one.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.586
Suppose he fails ours.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.954
You willing to stipulate
to admissibility?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.822
Right now.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.895
This man is innocent.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.635
I've never
done this before.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.770
Done what?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.905
Traded on
our personal relationship.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.540
Helen, we know each other.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.542
I have never
asked for a favor

07:55.576 --> 07:57.878
on the basis
of our friendship.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.145
I'm doing it here,

07:59.179 --> 08:01.181
and I've earned it
one time, Helen.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.150
I've earned it.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.720
Now, you trust the accuracy
of lie detectors,

08:06.753 --> 08:10.891
give him one.
If he passes...

08:10.924 --> 08:12.225
kick it.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.733
You want to run that
by me again?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.635
Our case is circumstantial.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.105
Evidently, he has passed
a polygraph over and over.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.040
His lawyer is willing
to box him

08:27.073 --> 08:28.642
with our own polygraph.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.276
Helen, the trial starts
in two hours.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.011
I realize that, Kate.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.114
And you want to, what --

08:34.147 --> 08:35.782
put out a release
saying, "oops"?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.784
If this man did not
commit the crime,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.785
I'm not going to secure
a conviction

08:39.820 --> 08:42.188
simply to avoid
a public relations nightmare.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.323
I just...

08:43.356 --> 08:45.025
Look,
I saw that interrogation.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.161
Maybe he was disoriented
like he says.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.696
You've got motive.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.132
There's forensics,
the whack on the head.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.867
They were heard fighting.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.070
Nobody described the woman
as remotely suicidal.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.039
The man did it.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.307
I don't care
if he passed 50 polygraphs.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.676
I'm not so sure.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.611
Well, let me make it
easy for you.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.214
You're prosecuting
this case.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.822
I think it goes without saying,
but I'll say it anyway --

09:15.856 --> 09:18.224
this offer in no way
admits to any liability

09:18.258 --> 09:20.827
on the part of the environmental
protection agency.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.263
We realize that.
What's the number?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.299
$20,000.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.269
$20,000?

09:29.302 --> 09:30.804
Apiece.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.338
Times 3,
that's $60,000.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.107
MAN #2: More than
the case is worth.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.909
And we're only offering it

09:35.942 --> 09:37.978
to avoid the publicity that
this hearing might generate.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.281
We have children with severe
learning disabilities.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.716
Motor skills --

09:42.749 --> 09:44.651
look, even if that thing
is toxic,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.653
the government
didn't manufacture it.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.989
Yes, that's been your argument,
but you lost the 12-B-6,

09:49.022 --> 09:50.857
you lost
the federal tort claims act --

09:50.891 --> 09:54.294
I don't think we'll lose
at summary judgment.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.296
You represented on the phone
on Monday

09:56.329 --> 09:58.264
and then again this morning

09:58.298 --> 10:00.266
that a serious offer
was coming in.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.268
The figure represents
the maximum authorized

10:02.302 --> 10:03.737
by the agency, so --

10:03.770 --> 10:05.872
Then why are we talking?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.874
Because we have faith
that logic eventually seeps

10:07.908 --> 10:09.710
into even the most
hardheaded of craniums.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.811
Get out!

10:10.844 --> 10:11.912
You're obligated
to take the offer

10:11.945 --> 10:13.379
to your clients, Miss Frutt.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.316
However much your firm might
end up out of pocket.

10:16.349 --> 10:20.921
Ethically, you are required
to present this offer
to the plaintiffs.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.426
Thank you, Mr. Meyers.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.796
Our clients
are low-income parents

10:29.830 --> 10:33.033
whose children
have lifelong handicaps

10:33.066 --> 10:36.670
due, in part,
to the agency you represent.

10:36.703 --> 10:40.073
You have the indecency
to come in here and tell us

10:40.106 --> 10:43.076
that their injuries
are worth only $20,000,

10:43.109 --> 10:45.245
and then to add
to that insult,

10:45.278 --> 10:50.250
you are lecturing me
on ethics?

10:50.283 --> 10:54.020
Get the hell out of here
before I throw you out.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.838
You're tilting at
the wrong windmill this time.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.875
You haven't
seen us tilt yet.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.033
How you doing?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.370
I just went
into the bathroom

11:44.404 --> 11:45.939
and threw up.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.111
We got to tell the clients.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.780
We should go there again.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.319
You can't beat yourself up,
Ellenor.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.422
It's a miracle
you got it this far.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.927
$20,000.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.030
What a miracle.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.065
LINDSAY: We should go.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.409
When I arrived,

12:23.443 --> 12:26.412
the defendant was sitting
right out on the driveway.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.214
He seemed very despondent.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.417
Inside the garage,
we found the victim

12:31.451 --> 12:34.320
facedown on the floor
next to the vehicle,

12:34.354 --> 12:36.957
bleeding slightly
from the back of the head.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.058
She was dead?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.425
Yes.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.795
There was a garden hose
taped to the exhaust pipe

12:41.828 --> 12:43.897
leading to the rear
passenger-side window.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.333
It appeared to be a suicide
by carbon monoxide poisoning.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.803
Did you run prints
on the garden hose?

12:49.836 --> 12:53.439
We found prints matching
the victim and the defendant.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.142
BOBBY: You said Mr. Wallace
seemed despondent.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.411
Could he have possibly
been in shock?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.414
-Possibly.
-Did my client tell you that he
pulled the hose out of the car?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.350
-Yes. He did.
-And that he pulled his wife
from the vehicle?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.319
He said that, yes.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.889
I was walking my dog at 9:30

13:08.922 --> 13:10.824
and I heard him
screaming at his wife

13:10.857 --> 13:12.158
from inside the house.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.994
Are you sure
you heard Scott Wallace?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.461
I'm 100% sure.
He's my neighbor.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.898
I know what his voice
sounds like.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.834
And I was about 20 feet
from his front door.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.604
He and Jill were both
yelling at each other.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.471
Do you know what about?

13:25.506 --> 13:29.009
No, but I found out later
she was planning to leave him.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.076
Objection.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.177
Sustained.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.346
You're sure
this was around 9:30?

13:33.379 --> 13:37.183
Positive. That's when
I walk my dog every night.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.619
One last thing.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.354
You said you could recognize
the defendant's voice.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.857
You could recognize
his screaming voice?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.025
Yes.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.627
You heard him scream before?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.461
Many times.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.930
He and his wife

13:49.963 --> 13:51.464
had a lot of nasty
screaming fights.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.100
Once we even
called the police.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.002
You called the police
that night?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.370
No.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.273
-You hear any signs
of violence?
-No.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.576
In fact, you heard nothing that
caused you any sense of alarm.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.410
Well, I --

14:04.444 --> 14:07.648
you didn't feel the need
to intervene.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.482
No.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.119
There were shed skin cells
on the victim's head, neck.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.089
DNA analysis revealed
an exact genetic match.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.123
With who?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.191
The defendant.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.160
We also analyzed
a skin fragment

14:20.193 --> 14:22.162
found under
the defendant's fingernail.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.964
Were you able
to identify it?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.966
It was a genetic match
to the victim.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.669
If my client were trying
to resuscitate the victim,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.671
it's possible
that shed skin cells

14:30.704 --> 14:33.974
could get on the victim's
head and neck, right, doctor?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.441
That's possible, yes.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.144
And while trying to save her,
it's possible that

14:38.178 --> 14:40.080
a piece of her skin could get
under his fingernail, right?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.082
That might be less likely.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.150
I'm asking you,
is it possible?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.919
Of course.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.021
And all this DNA evidence
we're talking about --

14:48.054 --> 14:49.690
it could have come
as a direct result

14:49.723 --> 14:51.525
of my client's efforts
to save his wife,

14:51.558 --> 14:52.926
isn't that right, doctor?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.160
That's not
what I think happened.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.428
But it's possible.

14:55.461 --> 14:59.299
Yes...it is.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.567
Thank you.

15:07.508 --> 15:09.209
I can't believe it.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.277
We were just as shocked
as you are.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.280
I thought it was going
to be a substantial offer.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.016
Didn't they tell you that?

15:16.049 --> 15:19.285
They intimated that
we would be very happy, yes.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.023
Our suspicion is they did that
to lull us a little,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.058
thinking if we were
expecting settlement,

15:25.091 --> 15:27.327
we really wouldn't prepare
that hard for their motion.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.062
Were they right?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.965
Absolutely not.
We're very ready.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.401
After what they did
to our children...

15:35.435 --> 15:37.137
The hearing's tomorrow.

15:37.170 --> 15:40.406
If we win, we think
their numbers will come up.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.209
I have to be honest and say

15:43.243 --> 15:48.148
that I am very disappointed
with the two of you.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.217
We had a few people tell us
that we should have never
hired you,

15:51.251 --> 15:54.254
that you didn't have
the resources to --

15:54.287 --> 15:55.656
but we liked you.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.061
Well, right now
I feel deceived.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.997
I feel like
you promised things

16:04.030 --> 16:06.332
to get the case,

16:06.366 --> 16:09.636
things which you obviously
can't deliver.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.077
Can I respond to that?

16:17.110 --> 16:19.546
When we took this case,

16:19.580 --> 16:21.114
we thought we would be suing

16:21.147 --> 16:23.016
the manufacturer
of that play gym.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.385
That was a much stronger case.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.353
Then, when we discovered
both that company

16:27.387 --> 16:29.623
and the chemical company
no longer existed,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.257
your case was basically over

16:31.291 --> 16:34.194
until Ellenor came up
with the idea to sue the E. P. A.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.596
She beat them
in the motion to dismiss,

16:35.629 --> 16:37.463
she got through
the administration level,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.265
earning the right
to keep going.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.801
I'm sure there are
other firms out there

16:40.834 --> 16:42.669
that could have gotten it
this far,

16:42.703 --> 16:44.638
but the reality is
they wouldn't have tried.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.540
Most lawyers
would have dropped this case

16:46.573 --> 16:48.374
as soon as they found
the manufacturer

16:48.408 --> 16:49.576
to be nonexistent.

16:49.610 --> 16:51.377
But Ellenor --
and me with her --

16:51.411 --> 16:55.115
kept going
out of commitment to you.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.417
Maybe we failed...

16:57.450 --> 16:59.653
but I take exception
to the suggestion

16:59.686 --> 17:03.223
that it was a mistake
to hire us.

17:03.256 --> 17:08.060
We're just...disappointed.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.695
That's all.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.133
We all are.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.670
Let's just do our best
at summary judgment,

17:16.703 --> 17:21.107
and hopefully we'll survive
to get this to a jury.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.786
The cause of death
was monoxide poisoning.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.689
What about the bleeding
from the back of her head?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.357
That contusion
was the result

17:37.390 --> 17:39.092
of being struck
with a blunt object.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.594
You said blunt instrument.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.363
Could that instrument
be a cement floor?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
If she fell
on the garage floor,

17:45.398 --> 17:47.367
hitting the back
of her head,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.636
could that have caused
the trauma we're talking about?

17:49.670 --> 17:52.172
A fracture like that
couldn't have happened

17:52.205 --> 17:54.174
by someone simply
falling down.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.210
If my client discovered
his wife in the car,

17:57.243 --> 17:59.379
he grabbed her,
pulled her out,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.648
and as he was
pulling her out,

18:01.682 --> 18:03.650
her head crashed
onto the floor --

18:03.684 --> 18:06.186
-Objection.
-Overruled.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.454
Doctor, if my client
discovered his wife

18:08.488 --> 18:10.724
in the car unconscious,
pulled her out,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.726
causing her head
to hit the floor,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.728
could that have caused
the fracture

18:14.761 --> 18:16.362
we're talking about?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.464
It's a possibility,
but I --

18:18.498 --> 18:20.801
Thank you, doctor.
That's all.

18:22.703 --> 18:24.170
Ms. Gamble.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.208
The Commonwealth
calls Kyle Barrett.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.210
This seems like
a good time

18:30.243 --> 18:31.645
to call it a day.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.581
We'll begin with Mr. Barrett
in the morning.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.584
(gallery murmuring)

18:37.618 --> 18:40.621
Get Mr. Barrett
to my office now.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.325
He's going to walk?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.493
-I'm not saying that, but --
-But what?

18:47.528 --> 18:50.263
He killed my sister.
Don't tell me now that he's --

18:50.296 --> 18:52.866
Mr. Barrett, as we have
explained from the start,

18:52.899 --> 18:54.601
our case
is hugely circumstantial.

18:54.635 --> 18:56.703
We had hoped to be able
to introduce

18:56.737 --> 18:58.705
the videotape interrogation.

18:58.739 --> 18:59.873
And you can't?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.775
Not unless we get him
on the stand.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.343
This will only happen

19:03.376 --> 19:05.345
if his lawyers
think he's losing,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.614
which I'm sure
they don't think right now.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.716
The case has gone
pretty well for them.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.519
The only witness
that we have left

19:12.553 --> 19:15.722
that can put them
in the necessary hole is you.

19:15.756 --> 19:18.258
Which means
when we ask you,

19:18.291 --> 19:19.893
"Did your sister
seem suicidal?"

19:19.926 --> 19:21.895
a response
of "I didn't think so"

19:21.928 --> 19:23.630
isn't going to do it.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.832
Also, to the extent
that you talk about anything

19:25.866 --> 19:27.834
your sister told you,
that's hearsay.

19:27.868 --> 19:29.469
But under the law,

19:29.503 --> 19:31.471
one of the ways
around the hearsay rule

19:31.505 --> 19:33.473
is an exception
called the state of mind.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.708
Richard --

19:34.741 --> 19:36.710
Basically, if you can say

19:36.743 --> 19:39.212
she wanted to start
a new life --

19:39.245 --> 19:40.547
Richard.

19:40.581 --> 19:43.216
Mr. Barrett,
we certainly don't mean

19:43.249 --> 19:45.285
to put words
in your mouth,

19:45.318 --> 19:47.554
nor would it be permissible
for us to do so.

19:47.588 --> 19:49.455
But you need to realize

19:49.489 --> 19:51.558
unless you do damage,

19:51.592 --> 19:55.662
Scott Wallace
probably won't testify,

19:55.696 --> 19:58.765
in which case
he could in fact go free.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.836
You knew your sister, sir.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.672
If she was planning
to start a new life,

20:05.706 --> 20:07.974
if she was
in a positive place,

20:08.008 --> 20:09.342
there is no way

20:09.375 --> 20:11.945
she would ever
take her own life,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.580
not in any circumstance,

20:13.614 --> 20:15.481
certainly not
in this situation,

20:15.516 --> 20:17.851
where she was looking forward
to starting over.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.419
She was murdered.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.854
If you know it --

20:20.887 --> 20:22.956
she did not
commit suicide --

20:22.989 --> 20:25.291
you absolutely know it.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.031
I got it.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.299
We'll see you in there.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.710
First you tell him

20:43.744 --> 20:45.712
how to beat
the hearsay rule,

20:45.746 --> 20:48.715
then you practically
supply his testimony.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.851
Helen, I'm just
preparing our witness.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.485
I explain the law,

20:52.519 --> 20:53.887
tell him what's relevant
and what to emphasize.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.822
I do it, you do it.

20:55.856 --> 20:58.291
And besides,
you said it yourself.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.360
This witness
is all we have

21:00.393 --> 21:02.629
to get Scott Wallace
in that chair.

21:02.663 --> 21:05.599
Be glad I coached him.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.308
I have to testify.

21:15.341 --> 21:17.310
I've explained this,
Scott.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.780
If you get up there,
they can put in the video.

21:19.813 --> 21:21.014
But if I don't
tell my side --

21:21.047 --> 21:22.448
We've backdoored
your story.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.651
The jury knows your version
of the events.

21:24.685 --> 21:26.352
Listen to me.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.522
Now, I know I have
the right not to testify,

21:28.555 --> 21:32.025
but I also know that juries
draw inferences sometimes

21:32.058 --> 21:33.794
about defendants who don't.

21:33.827 --> 21:35.529
Now, I'm a credible
witness.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.063
I can explain
that videotape,

21:37.097 --> 21:39.966
and the jury
can see me as a person.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.969
It's a bad idea.

21:43.003 --> 21:45.939
Trust me.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.549
Um, Ms. Frutt.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.918
Can you excuse me
for one second?

22:02.856 --> 22:05.491
All right. $32,500.

22:05.526 --> 22:07.728
-Rejected.
-Aren't you going
to make that --

22:07.761 --> 22:09.730
We don't need to present
that to our clients.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.565
And if your intent
with that insulting lowball

22:11.598 --> 22:13.567
is to inflame me before
we go in to argue,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.001
it's not going to work.

22:15.035 --> 22:16.837
You seem
a model of restraint.

22:16.870 --> 22:18.739
You know something,
Mr. Meyers?

22:18.772 --> 22:20.841
I have a thing
about smug.

22:20.874 --> 22:22.576
I don't like smug.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.946
I know how you people work.
You hustle in clients --

22:25.979 --> 22:28.114
-All right, all right, John.
-No, no, Mitchell.

22:28.148 --> 22:29.783
The courts are clogged
by bottom-feeders like you

22:29.816 --> 22:31.585
who sue without bothering
to even consult the law.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.654
We consulted the law,
trust me.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.056
And don't think for a second
that after we're through here

22:36.089 --> 22:39.059
we won't go after you
for abuse of process.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.127
MITCHELL: Let's not let
our tempers prevail here.

22:41.161 --> 22:42.629
Come on.

22:48.902 --> 22:50.871
Things just got worse.

22:50.904 --> 22:52.806
Judge Gilmore
got appendicitis.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.041
The case was transferred
to Judge Aldrich.

22:55.075 --> 22:56.142
What?

22:56.176 --> 22:57.944
Judge Aldrich is sitting?

22:57.978 --> 23:00.514
-I'm afraid so.
-Oh, great.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.516
He'll kick this before we
even get through the door.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.050
Let's just go for it.

23:04.084 --> 23:07.153
There's nothing else
we can do at this point.

23:07.187 --> 23:09.790
She was both excited
and terrified.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.992
Excited and terrified
of what, sir?

23:12.025 --> 23:14.995
Well, excited to be
starting a new life,

23:15.028 --> 23:16.997
at being single again.

23:17.030 --> 23:18.532
Objection.
This is all hearsay.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.900
State-of-mind exception.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.702
-Whose state of mind?
-The victim's.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.169
Oh, come on.

23:23.203 --> 23:24.738
Judge, they're aruging
that she killed herself.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.607
The fact that
she told her brother

23:26.640 --> 23:29.075
she wanted to live
directly rebuts that.

23:29.109 --> 23:31.545
I'm going to allow it.
The objection is overruled.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.179
You said your sister
looked forward

23:33.213 --> 23:35.749
to meeting a man
she could love.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.984
Yes. She was planning
on telling Scott

23:38.018 --> 23:40.020
that she wanted a divorce.

23:40.053 --> 23:42.589
And why was she
so terrified, if you know?

23:42.623 --> 23:44.490
She was afraid
of Scott's temper.

23:44.525 --> 23:46.560
-She told you this?
-Yes.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.662
She at one point
wanted me to be with her

23:48.695 --> 23:49.930
when she told him.

23:49.963 --> 23:51.565
Why was that?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.767
She was afraid that
he might try to harm her.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.835
-Objection.
-Objection.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.037
I'll allow it.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.939
Did your sister
say anything else, sir?

23:58.972 --> 24:00.941
She said that
if she turned up missing,

24:00.974 --> 24:02.943
or if I didn't
hear from her,

24:02.976 --> 24:04.945
that I should
call the police,

24:04.978 --> 24:07.047
because Scott probably
did something to her.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.148
Objection!

24:08.181 --> 24:10.183
Overruled.

24:16.256 --> 24:18.692
Mr. Barrett,
you've heard speculation

24:18.725 --> 24:20.961
that maybe your sister
took her life.

24:20.994 --> 24:22.596
That's ridiculous.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.897
Why, sir?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.066
My sister and I
talked every day.

24:26.099 --> 24:27.868
We were extremely close.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.603
She hid nothing from me.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.605
If she was in
so much as a bad mood,

24:31.638 --> 24:33.039
I would see it.

24:33.073 --> 24:35.976
She was not depressed,
she was not despondent,

24:36.009 --> 24:38.144
she had
no mental deficiencies,

24:38.178 --> 24:41.147
and the idea
that she took her own life

24:41.181 --> 24:43.817
is absolutely preposterous.

24:46.186 --> 24:48.188
I have nothing further.

24:56.196 --> 24:58.532
Mr. Barrett,
you think my client

24:58.565 --> 25:00.667
killed your sister,
don't you?

25:00.701 --> 25:01.802
-Objection.
-Goes to bias.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.269
I'll allow it.

25:03.303 --> 25:04.771
You think he did it?

25:04.805 --> 25:06.172
I know he did it.

25:06.206 --> 25:08.108
And if you think
this man killed your sister,

25:08.141 --> 25:10.110
you'd want him to go
to jail, wouldn't you?

25:10.143 --> 25:11.912
In fact, if you had
the opportunity

25:11.945 --> 25:13.747
to help put this man
in jail,

25:13.780 --> 25:15.582
you'd probably jump at it,
wouldn't you?

25:15.616 --> 25:17.551
What are you suggesting,
counsel?

25:17.584 --> 25:19.653
Well, I'm suggesting you'd do
anything to put the man

25:19.686 --> 25:21.922
you think killed your sister
behind bars.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.224
You'd even get up
in that witness chair and lie.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.192
-HELEN: Objection!
-I never lied.

25:26.226 --> 25:28.028
Well, I have your statement
to the police right here,

25:28.061 --> 25:29.963
taken the night
your sister died,

25:29.996 --> 25:32.766
and you didn't say anything
about her telling you,

25:32.799 --> 25:34.768
"If I disappear,
call the police."

25:34.801 --> 25:37.037
You didn't say anything
about her telling you

25:37.070 --> 25:39.873
she was afraid of being
harmed, did you, Mr. Barrett?

25:39.906 --> 25:41.007
I believe I did.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.777
Where is it?

25:43.810 --> 25:46.046
Here's your statement.
Where is it?

25:46.079 --> 25:49.149
Maybe the officer didn't
write it down, but I --

25:49.182 --> 25:50.684
Didn't write it down?

25:50.717 --> 25:52.686
The officer forgot
to write that down?

25:52.719 --> 25:55.188
Look, I have
always maintained

25:55.221 --> 25:57.257
that your client
killed my sister.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.859
Yes, you've always
maintained it.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.727
It has always
been your opinion,

26:00.761 --> 26:02.262
but this is the first
we're hearing of any facts,

26:02.295 --> 26:04.965
any statements like,
"He'll try to harm me."

26:04.998 --> 26:06.700
This is the first
we're hearing of this

26:06.733 --> 26:07.801
because you just decided
to make those statements up,

26:07.834 --> 26:09.269
didn't you, Mr. Barrett?

26:09.302 --> 26:11.004
-HELEN: Objection!
-Overruled.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.973
You want to put
that man away so bad

26:13.006 --> 26:14.641
that you got up here and lied
to get the job done.

26:14.675 --> 26:16.276
-HELEN: Objection!
-All right, Mr. Young.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.244
You say your sister
wasn't depressed,

26:18.278 --> 26:20.080
she had
no mental deficiencies.

26:20.113 --> 26:22.148
Didn't my client
share with you

26:22.182 --> 26:25.118
his concern that your sister
had huge mood swings,

26:25.151 --> 26:26.720
that she might even
need medication?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.288
-Hearsay!
-Overruled.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.724
Didn't he come to you once
seeking your help

26:30.757 --> 26:33.727
as her brother to convince
her to get treatment?

26:33.760 --> 26:34.995
Absolutely not.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.830
-You're a liar.
-Objection!

26:36.863 --> 26:37.831
-Mr. Young!
-You're under oath
here, Mr. Barrett.

26:37.864 --> 26:38.965
Objection!

26:38.999 --> 26:40.266
Sustained.

26:40.300 --> 26:44.104
Mr. Young, don't make me
warn you again.

26:44.137 --> 26:46.840
You say your sister
wanted you

26:46.873 --> 26:50.176
to come with her
that night, but you didn't.

26:50.210 --> 26:53.013
Because I didn't think
he would really kill her.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.280
I was wrong.

26:54.314 --> 26:56.382
What did you do
that night, Mr. Barrett?

26:56.416 --> 26:58.284
I'm in a weekly card game.

27:00.153 --> 27:01.855
Your sister told you

27:01.888 --> 27:03.857
she was afraid
for her life,

27:03.890 --> 27:05.859
but you couldn't help her

27:05.892 --> 27:08.328
because you had
a poker game?

27:15.335 --> 27:17.337
I think I got it.

27:21.808 --> 27:22.976
Ms. Gamble.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.878
The Commonwealth rests,
your honor.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.246
Mr. Donnell?

27:26.279 --> 27:29.315
One second, your honor.

27:29.349 --> 27:30.817
What do you think?

27:30.851 --> 27:32.352
Right now we still
have a chance,

27:32.385 --> 27:34.220
but if that videotape
comes in --

27:34.254 --> 27:35.889
Scott, it's still our opinion
that you don't testify.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.691
It would open the door
on the tape.

27:37.724 --> 27:40.260
But, Bobby, he is lying.
Now, I can --

27:40.293 --> 27:42.328
-Eugene crossed him
pretty good, I think.
-Yeah, I want to testify.

27:42.362 --> 27:44.164
-I can't let you.
-Bobby, I --

27:44.197 --> 27:46.366
-Scott, if you get up there,
we'll lose.
-Bobby --

27:46.399 --> 27:49.069
The defense rests,
your honor.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.404
(gallery murmuring)

27:59.179 --> 28:02.448
What's happening here
is obvious.

28:02.482 --> 28:05.351
The manufacturer here
of the playground equipment

28:05.385 --> 28:08.354
that caused these alleged
injuries to the children

28:08.388 --> 28:10.190
has gone out of business,

28:10.223 --> 28:12.759
leaving the parents
with nobody to sue,

28:12.793 --> 28:17.230
so they file a claim
against the E. P. A.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.200
The plaintiffs have cited
no persuasive case law,

28:20.233 --> 28:21.835
state or federal,

28:21.868 --> 28:24.838
that would allow
for a United States agency

28:24.871 --> 28:27.841
to be sued for the conduct
of a private business.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.309
And, your honor,

28:29.342 --> 28:33.313
let's consider the logic
of what they're asking for.

28:33.346 --> 28:35.849
Since these injuries
were caused

28:35.882 --> 28:38.218
by environmental factors,
they're suing

28:38.251 --> 28:41.221
the Environmental
Protection Agency.

28:41.254 --> 28:44.858
Under that theory,
since we have an F. D. A.,

28:44.891 --> 28:47.060
you could hold
the government liable

28:47.093 --> 28:49.796
for any harm caused
by a drug manufacturer.

28:49.830 --> 28:51.497
Since we have an F. A. A.,

28:51.532 --> 28:54.801
you could sue the government
for every plane crash.

28:54.835 --> 28:57.871
I understand that we live
in a litigious society,

28:57.904 --> 29:00.874
but the idea of suing
the federal government

29:00.907 --> 29:02.242
for the actions

29:02.275 --> 29:04.244
of any regulated
private industry --

29:04.277 --> 29:05.879
that's ludicrous.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.148
As a matter of law,

29:08.181 --> 29:10.183
this claim is untenable,

29:10.216 --> 29:12.418
and accordingly,
the government's motion

29:12.452 --> 29:15.388
for summary judgment
should be granted.

29:21.562 --> 29:23.296
We are not suggesting

29:23.329 --> 29:26.266
that the government be held
liable for air disasters

29:26.299 --> 29:28.301
simply because
there's an F. A. A.,

29:28.334 --> 29:31.905
nor are we saying that
the E. P. A. should pay damages

29:31.938 --> 29:34.541
every time there's
an environmental crisis.

29:34.575 --> 29:37.177
We're saying,
in this situation,

29:37.210 --> 29:39.312
three children got hurt --

29:39.345 --> 29:41.181
very hurt --

29:41.214 --> 29:43.550
because the Environmental
Protection Agency

29:43.584 --> 29:45.919
didn't do its job.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.555
So you are alleging
the kids got hurt

29:48.589 --> 29:50.924
by toxic
playground equipment?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.292
Yes.

29:52.325 --> 29:55.028
There is a preservative,
which is also a pesticide,

29:55.061 --> 29:57.197
known as chromated
copper arsenic -- CCA.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.866
It's used to pressure-treat
wood, and it's found

29:59.900 --> 30:02.202
in decks and playground
equipment everywhere --

30:02.235 --> 30:04.505
And I mean everywhere.

30:04.538 --> 30:08.909
With age, this pesticide
leaches into the dirt,

30:08.942 --> 30:10.577
which is what happened
in my clients' yard,

30:10.611 --> 30:12.946
where their children
played every day.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.348
But why should
the E. P. A. Be held liable?

30:15.381 --> 30:17.317
They didn't make
that playground equipment.

30:17.350 --> 30:19.485
Our argument
is that the E. P. A. knew

30:19.520 --> 30:21.487
about the dangers
of this pesticide.

30:21.522 --> 30:24.090
They've known about it
for almost 30 years,

30:24.124 --> 30:26.226
and yet they have
continued to let

30:26.259 --> 30:29.229
the wood preservers
use the stuff.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.263
This is a complete lie.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.598
-Would you shut up?
-Counsel.

30:31.632 --> 30:32.599
He's arguing the merits.

30:32.633 --> 30:35.101
Let me deal with him.

30:35.135 --> 30:38.004
The basis of your claim

30:38.038 --> 30:41.007
is that the E.P.A.
knew of these dangers.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.909
Our claim is that

30:42.943 --> 30:46.513
when a governmental agency
knows of a toxic condition

30:46.547 --> 30:48.515
that causes
developmental problems

30:48.549 --> 30:51.017
in the nervous system
of children --

30:51.051 --> 30:55.155
when a governmental agency
knows of a toxic chemical

30:55.188 --> 30:57.023
that is being
regularly used

30:57.057 --> 30:58.525
to make
playground equipment --

30:58.559 --> 31:02.262
when that governmental agency
does nothing to stop it,

31:02.295 --> 31:04.898
then, yes, that agency
is blameworthy,

31:04.931 --> 31:08.535
and, yes, that agency
should incur some liability.

31:08.569 --> 31:13.006
Ms. Frutt, first,
I can do without the tone.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.375
Second, we could
complain every day

31:15.408 --> 31:17.277
about the government
not doing enough.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.546
We can't prevent every disaster.
You know that.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.482
Yes, but this disaster
was preventable.

31:22.516 --> 31:24.484
As are most
automobile casualties, too.

31:24.518 --> 31:26.119
The government could mandate

31:26.152 --> 31:28.054
that every car
be built like a tank.

31:28.088 --> 31:29.523
They could legislate that

31:29.556 --> 31:31.592
every airline passenger
be equipped with a parachute.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.160
There are lots of things
the government could do

31:34.194 --> 31:35.562
to make things safer,

31:35.596 --> 31:37.397
but there are
economic realities.

31:37.430 --> 31:39.165
I understand that,

31:39.199 --> 31:41.568
and if the economics
of fixing a problem

31:41.602 --> 31:43.169
is prohibitive, fine,

31:43.203 --> 31:46.172
but how about
simply informing the public

31:46.206 --> 31:47.508
that a problem exists?

31:47.541 --> 31:51.512
They know there is
a chemical that causes harm.

31:51.545 --> 31:53.514
How about simply
alerting the public?

31:53.547 --> 31:55.516
Would that be
too much of a burden

31:55.549 --> 31:57.518
on the federal government?

31:57.551 --> 32:00.587
Maybe not. My question is,
do they have a duty to?

32:00.621 --> 32:04.057
Our position is that they
have a duty to make known

32:04.090 --> 32:06.326
all toxic,
dangerous conditions

32:06.359 --> 32:07.994
that they know of.

32:08.028 --> 32:11.064
The E. P. A. is still
sitting on this information.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.333
That chemical
is still leaching

32:13.366 --> 32:15.168
into the dirt
at playgrounds,

32:15.201 --> 32:17.270
children are playing
in that dirt,

32:17.303 --> 32:20.073
and the E. P. A. still
isn't informing people.

32:20.106 --> 32:23.076
Why? Because
the wood manufacturers

32:23.109 --> 32:25.712
have lobbied congress to get
the E. P. A. to back off,

32:25.746 --> 32:28.715
and the only reason why
I know about this problem

32:28.749 --> 32:31.451
is because
of three sick children

32:31.484 --> 32:34.220
whose parents hired me.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.200
Closing?

32:47.233 --> 32:50.537
Yeah.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.479
If a client wants to testify,
it's his right.

32:59.513 --> 33:01.047
He's not seeing straight.

33:01.081 --> 33:03.149
The guy is talking
about Fiji.

33:03.183 --> 33:06.319
He's competent, he wanted to
testify, and you prevented it.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.421
And what would the result
be of that videotape?

33:08.454 --> 33:12.325
He's competent.
His decision was to testify.

33:12.358 --> 33:15.428
And you sat silent.

33:20.534 --> 33:23.269
So we're both guilty.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.170
-He lied, Richard.
-We don't know that.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.772
-Helen.
-Of course we do.

33:58.805 --> 34:00.607
Oh, come on. The stuff
about his sister being afraid

34:00.641 --> 34:02.543
or "call the police" --
where did that --

34:02.576 --> 34:04.511
We don't know
that it's untrue.

34:04.545 --> 34:06.212
I know what you said to him,
how you coached him to be --

34:06.246 --> 34:07.614
Hey, Helen --

34:07.648 --> 34:09.783
The man committed perjury,
Richard. We both know it.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.518
That testimony
could convict.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.254
Even if he did
perjure himself,

34:14.286 --> 34:16.156
all we have is suspicion.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.158
Yes, we're both
technically covered.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.525
That doesn't solve it.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.527
We could have
an innocent man here

34:21.562 --> 34:24.164
who could end up
serving a life sentence

34:24.197 --> 34:26.399
based on lies which we
put into evidence.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.534
First of all,
he's not innocent.

34:28.569 --> 34:29.770
I think he is --

34:29.803 --> 34:32.338
Your opinion
isn't relevant.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.141
Second, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

34:35.175 --> 34:37.143
The witness said
what he said.

34:37.177 --> 34:39.513
For all we know,
it could be true.

34:39.545 --> 34:44.449
So, we just do our job
and argue the case, period.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.821
Oh, I suppose
you'll never be able

34:47.853 --> 34:49.656
to live with yourself now.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.257
Actually, I was thinking

34:51.291 --> 34:54.460
how I'd never be able
to live with you.

34:54.494 --> 34:56.897
If you can't bring
yourself to close,

34:56.929 --> 34:58.799
just say the word.

34:58.832 --> 35:00.433
The word here is

35:00.466 --> 35:02.435
the most damaging
prosecution witness

35:02.468 --> 35:04.805
just concocted
a bunch of big, fat lies.

35:04.838 --> 35:06.807
Now, look,
I can't prove it,

35:06.840 --> 35:09.876
but I know it,
and so do you.

35:17.684 --> 35:19.586
WOMAN: All rise.

35:22.422 --> 35:24.525
Be seated.

35:29.763 --> 35:32.566
It seems strained
that the government,

35:32.599 --> 35:35.669
by creating an agency
to watchdog private industries,

35:35.702 --> 35:37.403
could thereby become liable

35:37.437 --> 35:40.340
for the conduct
of those industries.

35:40.373 --> 35:43.777
I am further troubled
by the reality

35:43.810 --> 35:45.846
that it's the taxpayers
who pay these judgments,

35:45.879 --> 35:47.413
should there be any.

35:47.447 --> 35:50.517
True, the Environmental
Protection Agency

35:50.551 --> 35:53.319
is mandated to regulate
pesticides,

35:53.353 --> 35:56.623
but to say that the E.P.A.
knew of a leaching problem

35:56.657 --> 35:59.325
and failed either to correct it
or to warn about it

35:59.359 --> 36:01.828
makes them negligent
to the point

36:01.862 --> 36:03.897
where they should assume
responsibility

36:03.930 --> 36:08.702
is a hard leap for me to make
as a juror.

36:09.836 --> 36:11.872
But it is, in fact,

36:11.905 --> 36:15.375
a question a jury
should be deciding, not a judge.

36:15.408 --> 36:17.711
Defense motion
for summary judgment is denied.

36:17.744 --> 36:21.414
Trial date is set
for next tuesday.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.283
Adjourned.

36:23.316 --> 36:25.886
(gavel pounds)

36:25.919 --> 36:29.289
(gallery chattering)

36:29.322 --> 36:30.891
What happened?

36:30.924 --> 36:34.260
We won the motion.

36:34.294 --> 36:37.363
That's what happened.
We're still alive.

36:37.397 --> 36:40.901
I don't believe it.
I mean, I do, but I don't.

36:40.934 --> 36:42.569
Oh, my god.

36:42.603 --> 36:45.471
Okay, um, okay, we've got
a lot of work to do

36:45.506 --> 36:46.807
on our damage claim,

36:46.840 --> 36:48.742
and the trial is set
for next week,

36:48.775 --> 36:50.577
so we've got
to get together tonight.

36:50.611 --> 36:52.478
7:00 in our office.

36:52.513 --> 36:54.447
Ms. Frutt, can we talk?

36:54.480 --> 36:55.849
No.

36:55.882 --> 36:59.620
You have anything else to say,
you say it to a jury.

37:00.775 --> 37:05.755
Mr. Jamison, nobody wants
a long trial here.

37:05.792 --> 37:11.765
After eight months,
that's what you say to me?

37:11.798 --> 37:16.637
Go to hell.
Take your friend.

37:22.643 --> 37:26.780
They have no case.

37:26.813 --> 37:29.683
They find my client's prints
on the garden hose.

37:29.716 --> 37:32.819
Yes, because he yanked it
out of the car.

37:32.853 --> 37:36.289
They find his prints and DNA
on the victim.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.693
Yes, because he tried
to revive her.

37:39.726 --> 37:42.428
There was a fracture
on the back of her head.

37:42.462 --> 37:46.499
Yes, because Scott Wallace
pulled her out of the car,

37:46.533 --> 37:49.402
causing her head
to hit the cement floor.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.804
And seeing how anemic

37:50.837 --> 37:53.073
the case is
against Scott Wallace,

37:53.106 --> 37:55.341
the man he believed
killed his sister,

37:55.375 --> 37:58.979
Kyle Barrett took the stand
and lied.

37:59.012 --> 38:01.982
He testified his sister
was afraid Scott would harm her.

38:02.015 --> 38:05.819
Well, Kyle Barrett never
told the police that -- never.

38:05.852 --> 38:07.654
He just made it up.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.656
It was a desperate lie

38:09.690 --> 38:11.658
that cannot be corroborated
by anyone,

38:11.692 --> 38:14.094
and it's with that lie alone
that the prosecution

38:14.127 --> 38:16.563
is trying to convict
an innocent man.

38:16.597 --> 38:20.767
"My sister was afraid
he'd harm her."

38:20.801 --> 38:24.571
"If I disappear,
Scott did something."

38:24.605 --> 38:27.508
and he goes off to play poker?

38:28.942 --> 38:32.378
The reason Kyle Barrett
made up these lies

38:32.412 --> 38:36.750
is because sitting in this room
listening to the evidence,

38:36.783 --> 38:40.754
he recognized
what you have to recognize.

38:42.556 --> 38:47.474
The prosecution has no case.

38:53.634 --> 38:58.038
A woman announces to her husband
that she's going to leave him.

38:58.071 --> 39:01.608
They're heard
in a screaming argument,

39:01.642 --> 39:06.146
and she suddenly turns up dead.

39:06.179 --> 39:09.449
We're supposed to think suicide?

39:09.482 --> 39:12.519
Is there anybody who knew her

39:12.553 --> 39:15.622
to describe her as suicidal

39:15.656 --> 39:17.824
or even depressed,
for that matter?

39:17.858 --> 39:19.960
Does it make sense

39:19.993 --> 39:23.163
as she decides
to move forward with life,

39:23.196 --> 39:26.166
she then decides to end it?

39:26.199 --> 39:29.836
As for the brother's testimony
being a lie,

39:29.870 --> 39:31.972
where's the evidence of that?

39:32.005 --> 39:35.108
Did defense call anybody
to contradict him?

39:37.511 --> 39:40.914
Let's all use
a little common sense, shall we?

39:40.947 --> 39:44.918
A woman tries to leave
her husband.

39:44.951 --> 39:47.654
She ends up dead in the house,

39:47.688 --> 39:51.658
a whack to the back of the head,

39:51.692 --> 39:53.860
no witnesses.

39:55.862 --> 39:59.766
Figure it out.

40:06.973 --> 40:09.776
Every day
they need to be there?

40:09.810 --> 40:12.478
Yes. Our case
is your children,

40:12.513 --> 40:15.549
and we want the jury to see
their faces every single day,

40:15.582 --> 40:17.117
even during
the doctors' testimony.

40:17.150 --> 40:19.953
They can do it.
We've certainly prepared them.

40:19.986 --> 40:22.055
The defendants have
already brought a motion

40:22.088 --> 40:24.691
to bifurcate the trial,
which we are opposing,

40:24.725 --> 40:27.127
which means we really
should get to work.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.129
So we will be
in constant contact

40:29.162 --> 40:30.764
as we draw closer.

40:30.797 --> 40:32.699
Okay.

40:32.733 --> 40:36.469
Ms. Frutt.

40:38.004 --> 40:40.974
I apologize
for what I said before.

40:41.007 --> 40:42.976
You don't have to.

40:43.009 --> 40:45.612
Yes, I do.

40:45.646 --> 40:48.515
I know how hard
both of you have worked,

40:48.549 --> 40:51.618
and as I watched you
in the court,

40:51.652 --> 40:54.621
well...

40:54.655 --> 40:57.223
I felt ashamed
for doubting you.

41:00.661 --> 41:03.597
That was something.

41:04.931 --> 41:07.133
Thank you.

41:42.603 --> 41:44.538
Will the defendant
please rise?

41:47.007 --> 41:50.744
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has reached a unanimous verdict?

41:50.777 --> 41:52.312
We have, your honor.

41:52.345 --> 41:54.748
What say you?

41:54.781 --> 41:56.282
Commonwealth vs Scott Wallace

41:56.316 --> 41:58.752
on the charge
of murder in the first degree --

41:58.785 --> 42:02.322
we find the defendant
Scott Wallace guilty.

42:02.355 --> 42:04.791
JUDGE WOLFE:
Members of the jury,

42:04.825 --> 42:07.861
this completes your service.

42:07.894 --> 42:11.798
You are dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

42:11.832 --> 42:14.200
Defense moves
to set aside the verdict

42:14.234 --> 42:16.336
or for a new trial.

42:16.369 --> 42:18.338
You can file
those motions later.

42:18.371 --> 42:21.074
Security will take
the defendant into custody.

42:21.107 --> 42:23.309
We're adjourned.
(bangs gavel)

42:23.343 --> 42:26.580
We've got some grounds.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.615
The ruling to allow your
statement, we--

42:28.649 --> 42:30.984
We've got some grounds.
We'll appeal.

42:31.017 --> 42:33.219
Okay, okay,
okay.

42:33.253 --> 42:35.255
Where are they taking me?

42:35.288 --> 42:37.057
They're transferring
you to Cedars.

42:37.090 --> 42:38.659
Oh.

42:38.692 --> 42:42.128
We have grounds, Scott.
We'll appeal.

42:42.162 --> 42:45.098
Okay. I'll be okay.

42:48.234 --> 42:51.171
Mr. Donnell.

42:51.204 --> 42:53.173
MAN: Mr. Bay,
can I get a comment?

42:53.206 --> 42:57.077
Mr. Bay,
would you comment?

43:06.252 --> 43:07.688
Will you appeal?

43:07.721 --> 43:09.723
Yes, we will appeal.

43:32.312 --> 43:34.881
â™ª (theme)

43:57.871 --> 43:59.272
You stinker!
