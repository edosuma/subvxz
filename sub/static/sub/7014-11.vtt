WEBVTT

00:04.645 --> 00:06.179
So, guys, guess what.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.665
I found the perfect place for
me and Eric to get married.

00:14.912 --> 00:16.184
Where, Donna? Please tell us.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.686
Okay, well that place up by the lake
that overlooks the entire valley...

00:21.185 --> 00:22.418
Where people go for romance.

00:23.769 --> 00:24.769
You mean mount Hump?

00:26.972 --> 00:29.440
People don't go there for the romance, Donna.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.580
They go there for the humping.

00:32.648 --> 00:34.689
Eric, let's go up there tomorrow and check it out.

00:34.706 --> 00:35.673
I know the cruiser's in the shop,

00:35.741 --> 00:36.875
but we could take my dad's car.

00:36.942 --> 00:38.377
Donna, he's got that

00:38.444 --> 00:40.211
"honk if you're horny" bumper sticker.

00:42.278 --> 00:43.713
Yeah, well, I'd scrape it off,

00:43.980 --> 00:46.683
but "I brake for boobies" is underneath it.

00:48.751 --> 00:51.754
Why are you guys all in Steven's room?

00:50.822 --> 00:52.456
Well, Hyde was here,

00:52.724 --> 00:53.758
so I came in because

00:53.826 --> 00:55.925
I'm not comfortable enough
with myself to be alone.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.095
Yeah, but it's all gray, like a prison cell.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.230
Gray is why prisoners are unhappy.

01:04.299 --> 01:07.401
Really? I always thought it
was the loss of freedom...

01:07.468 --> 01:10.303
And the uninvited man love.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.272
Steven, I just think that you would be happier

01:13.340 --> 01:15.107
if you saw pretty things.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.677
Like when I look at myself in the mirror,

01:17.745 --> 01:20.646
I'm happy.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.816
When I look at you, I'm happy too,

01:23.884 --> 01:26.485
but when you talk, eh...

01:28.888 --> 01:32.924
Hey, Eric, I have to ask you
a very important question.

01:32.992 --> 01:36.160
Can I borrow your G.I. Joe
for a little experiment?

01:36.228 --> 01:37.194
No.

01:37.262 --> 01:40.264
I thought you were gonna say "yes."

01:40.331 --> 01:42.365
And by the way, the experiment was a success.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.167
G.I. Joe melts faster than cheese.

01:45.235 --> 01:48.203
Kelso, you can't just take my things

01:48.270 --> 01:49.371
without asking permission.

01:49.788 --> 01:51.255
Come on, we're friends.

01:51.323 --> 01:53.257
I figure what's mine is yours
and what's yours is mine.

01:53.325 --> 01:55.259
What's Donna's is mine, too.

01:55.627 --> 01:57.360
Kelso!

01:57.428 --> 02:00.630
Yeah, Barbie didn't make it, either.

02:00.698 --> 02:03.066
No one likes to see civilian casualties.

02:04.601 --> 02:07.904
âª

02:13.843 --> 02:15.210
That's weird.

02:15.278 --> 02:16.812
My finger's due back tomorrow,

02:17.029 --> 02:19.497
but my hand's due back next week.

02:19.565 --> 02:22.565
You know, Michael, I was a little worried

02:21.733 --> 02:23.667
about starting to date you,

02:23.735 --> 02:25.769
but lately, you've really impressed me.

02:25.837 --> 02:27.437
Well, that's the police motto...

02:27.505 --> 02:30.375
To serve and impress.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.678
I thought it was "serve and protect."

02:34.620 --> 02:37.356
They just changed it.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.496
Maybe you could take me to my
doctor's appointment tomorrow.

02:42.497 --> 02:43.497
We'll hear the baby's heartbeat.

02:45.314 --> 02:47.282
Seriously?

02:47.350 --> 02:49.284
You want me to do baby stuff with you?

02:49.352 --> 02:52.121
Yeah, you've been really
great these last few weeks.

02:52.188 --> 02:53.989
Yes, I have.

02:54.057 --> 02:56.726
And there's no telling what you'll do next.

02:56.793 --> 02:58.995
One day you might even read one of these things.

02:59.063 --> 03:01.664
Yeah, let's just pray to God that day never comes.

03:42.381 --> 03:43.281
Stupid Kelso.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.314
Guess what I packed.

03:48.781 --> 03:50.749
I'm gonna have to go with picnic.

03:50.816 --> 03:52.283
You win.

03:53.518 --> 03:55.719
So when do I get my car back?

03:55.787 --> 03:58.121
I don't know. We're scouting
places to have the wedding.

03:58.189 --> 03:59.822
You don't need to scout anywhere

03:59.890 --> 04:01.823
but the inside of a church.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.825
What better place to start a happy life

04:03.893 --> 04:07.361
than our lady of perpetual sorrow?

04:07.429 --> 04:10.030
Well, dad, the thing is we're
not getting married in a church.

04:10.498 --> 04:11.631
But we are thinking

04:11.748 --> 04:14.116
about getting married at mount Hump,

04:14.184 --> 04:17.685
which is sort of the church of humping.

04:17.753 --> 04:19.685
Well, no church, no car,

04:19.754 --> 04:21.721
just like it says in the bible.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.226
Well, the bible doesn't say anything

04:26.294 --> 04:27.661
about taking Kelso's van.

04:27.729 --> 04:30.230
Donna, we can't just take it.

04:30.297 --> 04:33.398
Of course we can. What's his is yours, remember?

04:33.465 --> 04:36.366
Do it for the liquefied face of g.I. Joe.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.836
I can't think of a more fitting way

04:41.304 --> 04:44.039
to honor the real American hero.

04:46.409 --> 04:49.445
âª

04:49.513 --> 04:53.984
You're welcome, big guy.

04:54.052 --> 04:55.453
What's this for?

04:55.521 --> 04:56.721
No reason.

04:56.789 --> 04:58.723
I was just thinking about you

04:58.791 --> 04:59.991
And how we've been through a lot together.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.294
No, we haven't.

05:03.630 --> 05:06.498
Oh, he gave you shoes.

05:06.565 --> 05:09.099
What do you say, Red?

05:09.167 --> 05:12.202
What the hell is wrong with you?

05:13.771 --> 05:17.209
Or we say, "thank you very much."

05:18.378 --> 05:20.847
Don't you think it's a little odd

05:20.914 --> 05:24.116
for a man to give another man a pair of shoes?

05:24.183 --> 05:25.450
I saw 'em.

05:25.518 --> 05:28.953
I thought they'd go nice with your tan pants.

05:29.021 --> 05:32.957
Quit thinking about my pants!

05:33.025 --> 05:35.260
My legs and what covers them

05:35.327 --> 05:38.095
is my business.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.501
He's very sensitive about his legs.

05:43.569 --> 05:45.870
You know, he shouldn't be.

05:45.938 --> 05:48.105
They're shapely, like a lady dancer.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.175
Maybe that's why he's so sensitive.

05:54.310 --> 05:57.511
âª

05:57.579 --> 05:59.947
Oh, finally.

06:00.015 --> 06:01.615
I've been waiting all afternoon.

06:01.683 --> 06:04.050
I'm about to burst!

06:05.453 --> 06:07.119
Hey, man.

06:07.187 --> 06:09.387
Thinking maybe you should wait out here.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.756
No, no, no, Fez. You should see this.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.957
It's a dream come true.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.262
Surprise!

06:20.330 --> 06:22.731
Jackie, what the hell happened to my room?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.434
I redecorated it.

06:24.502 --> 06:26.736
Now if a stranger comes in here,

06:26.804 --> 06:28.771
he'd never know you were poor.

06:28.838 --> 06:31.774
Looks like something for a girl.

06:31.841 --> 06:33.642
I like it.

06:33.710 --> 06:37.246
Or Fez. I can't live like this.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.181
I'm getting sick just looking at it.

06:39.248 --> 06:41.650
Yes, yes, Steven, that sick feeling

06:41.717 --> 06:44.185
is your orphan soul coming alive.

06:44.253 --> 06:47.821
Jackie, just put it all back, okay?

06:47.889 --> 06:50.493
Make it ugly and dirty like I like it.

06:50.561 --> 06:53.463
Well, excuse me for spending all morning

06:53.530 --> 06:56.031
putting up twinkle lights that are breathtaking,

06:56.099 --> 06:58.833
pillows as soft as
marshmallows and scented candles

06:59.101 --> 07:00.035
that make you feel like

06:59.802 --> 07:02.738
you're running through a field
like Laura freakin' ingalls!

07:02.806 --> 07:06.576
Okay, okay. We came here for a reason.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.144
Now should I start and you watch,

07:10.212 --> 07:13.445
or should you start and I watch?

07:13.513 --> 07:17.549
Either way, I'll be done first.

07:18.017 --> 07:20.451
âª

07:22.453 --> 07:24.453
So I told Hyde he could watch

07:24.521 --> 07:27.289
while Jackie and I do it.

07:27.357 --> 07:31.493
And then he beat my ass with a twinkle light.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.595
Where's my van?

07:36.030 --> 07:37.964
Now I parked it right here!

07:38.032 --> 07:42.000
Calm down. You probably just lost it again.

07:43.636 --> 07:45.537
Where was the last place you had it?

07:45.605 --> 07:48.140
Right here!

07:48.207 --> 07:50.508
Somebody stole my van!

07:50.576 --> 07:53.443
(gasps) That's horrible!

07:53.511 --> 07:56.612
I left a brand-new bag of tootsie rolls in there.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.580
Fez!

07:58.648 --> 08:00.982
Okay, okay, it was just half a bag.

08:01.050 --> 08:02.984
But if you talk to the insurance company,

08:03.052 --> 08:05.920
just tell them it was a whole bag.

08:05.987 --> 08:08.521
I finally got Brooke to trust me,

08:08.589 --> 08:10.590
and if I don't take her to
this doctor's appointment,

08:10.658 --> 08:12.859
I'm dead. What am I gonna do?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.760
Don't beat yourself up.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.628
It's only tootsie rolls.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.063
Look, I'm gonna take Red's car.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.732
I know he's got a hide-a-key
in there somewhere.

08:23.834 --> 08:27.035
Are you brain-damaged?

08:27.103 --> 08:29.938
Fez, did you just say, "are you brain-damaged?"

08:30.005 --> 08:32.307
and sound exactly like Red?

08:32.375 --> 08:36.211
Kelso, you know I only do
Johnny Carson and Pepe le Pew.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.315
Get away from my car.

08:41.381 --> 08:44.784
Your car, my car.

08:46.553 --> 08:50.355
Aren't we all just driving the same car?

08:50.423 --> 08:52.657
It's a car called life.

08:52.725 --> 08:54.726
How about I drive my foot

08:54.794 --> 08:57.361
into this thing called your ass?

08:57.429 --> 09:01.697
A simple "no" would suffice.

09:03.934 --> 09:07.002
âª

09:09.872 --> 09:11.806
Shoes are an inappropriate gift

09:11.874 --> 09:13.708
to give another man.

09:13.776 --> 09:15.743
Well, what about when you joined the service?

09:15.811 --> 09:17.845
Another man issued you your boots.

09:17.912 --> 09:20.380
But then he gave me a gun, so I let it go.

09:23.283 --> 09:25.418
Well, why don't you just accept the shoes

09:25.485 --> 09:27.753
because Bob is your friend?

09:27.821 --> 09:30.022
You don't understand how men work.

09:30.090 --> 09:32.023
We don't give each other presents.

09:32.091 --> 09:33.858
We pretty much ignore each other

09:33.926 --> 09:37.361
until someone scores a touchdown.

09:37.429 --> 09:39.563
You should listen to me.
I know how to be a friend,

09:39.631 --> 09:41.832
and you obviously don't, since you don't have any.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.434
I have plenty of friends.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.003
Charlie's a friend. He
saved my life during the war.

09:47.071 --> 09:49.505
And when is the last time you talked to Charlie?

09:49.573 --> 09:53.075
We said all we needed to
say on the boat back home.

09:55.378 --> 09:58.413
âª

10:00.382 --> 10:02.582
I don't believe this.

10:02.650 --> 10:06.719
This is crazy.

10:09.656 --> 10:13.858
(sniffs) not bad.

10:13.926 --> 10:16.260
(barry white) âª feels so good... âª

10:16.328 --> 10:18.729
Nice.

10:18.796 --> 10:20.964
âª lying here next to me... âª

10:21.031 --> 10:25.302
It's so soft.

10:25.369 --> 10:30.607
So smooth.

10:32.143 --> 10:35.444
Ahh.

10:35.512 --> 10:38.647
âª my hands just won't keep still... âª

10:38.714 --> 10:41.814
Oh, yeah!

10:47.819 --> 10:50.321
Isn't this amazing?

10:50.389 --> 10:54.759
It is called mount hump because
people come here to hump?

10:54.826 --> 10:56.760
Or do people come here to hump

10:56.828 --> 10:58.762
Because it's called mount hump?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.830
It's like the chicken or the egg.

11:00.897 --> 11:04.132
Well, I have a really good
feeling about this place.

11:06.301 --> 11:09.303
Donna, there are panties in the grass.

11:09.371 --> 11:11.773
Well, fez collects panties.

11:11.841 --> 11:14.142
So we could just set him loose up here

11:14.209 --> 11:16.377
Before the ceremony.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.647
So quiet and peaceful.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.749
Can't hear anything.

11:23.817 --> 11:28.086
Actually, I hear a car.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.788
(crash)

11:30.856 --> 11:33.191
Oh, man, some poor sucker

11:33.258 --> 11:35.859
Just totally got into an accident.

11:40.337 --> 11:41.970
âª

11:44.038 --> 11:45.405
(bell dinging)

11:50.378 --> 11:53.079
Your chariot has arrived, my lady.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.682
What happened to your van?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.350
A little problem with the van.

11:57.418 --> 11:58.718
I can't find it.

12:01.286 --> 12:02.986
Michael, people lose keys to a van,

12:02.954 --> 12:04.687
Not the whole van.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.689
Now I'm gonna miss my doctor's appointment.

12:06.756 --> 12:09.124
Look, brooke, this is not my fault.

12:09.192 --> 12:11.226
You're right. It's my fault for depending on you.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.195
Okay, I can fix this.

12:13.262 --> 12:16.130
Just hop on the handlebars
and I'll pedal you there.

12:16.198 --> 12:18.999
Hello! I'm pregnant!

12:19.067 --> 12:21.669
Okay, fine. You pedal and I'll ride.

12:24.537 --> 12:27.839
âª

12:37.546 --> 12:39.013
Oh, look.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.649
Here you are with all your friends.

12:44.853 --> 12:46.787
You claim to have all these friends.

12:46.854 --> 12:48.789
Here are last year's christmas cards.

12:48.856 --> 12:52.058
56 are for me. 4 for you.

12:52.126 --> 12:55.961
Kitty, a card from the
jose cuervo collector's club

12:56.029 --> 12:57.095
Doesn't count.

12:59.163 --> 13:01.998
Fine. I can afford to throw this one away

13:02.066 --> 13:05.968
Because I have 55 more.

13:06.036 --> 13:09.803
I will keep this because it has a coupon in it.

13:09.871 --> 13:11.171
Anyway, it doesn't matter

13:11.239 --> 13:13.173
Because I'm keeping the shoes.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.042
A good shoe is a good shoe
no matter where it comes from.

13:18.110 --> 13:22.414
Oh, it's like I'm walking on a pile of baby ducks.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.083
Well, hello there,

13:25.151 --> 13:27.753
Senor fancy sheets.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.355
I love the way jackie decorated your room.

13:30.223 --> 13:31.656
It's all
glittery, like--

13:31.724 --> 13:33.958
Like an italian person lives there.

13:36.026 --> 13:38.562
You let your girlfriend decorate your room?

13:40.430 --> 13:42.999
She also buy you a new dress?

13:43.067 --> 13:45.534
Yeah, I guess I have a lot to answer for.

13:45.601 --> 13:47.535
Then again, I never accepted a pair of shoes

13:47.603 --> 13:49.136
From another man.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.339
I knew it was a weird gift! Kitty said it wasn't.

13:52.407 --> 13:54.508
They're nice. Steven, tell him they're nice.

13:54.576 --> 13:57.278
Nah, can't do it.

13:57.346 --> 13:59.281
But you know what? Maybe she's right.

13:59.349 --> 14:00.783
Maybe you should keep the shoes

14:00.851 --> 14:02.351
And give bob a present in return,

14:02.419 --> 14:07.457
Like a necklace or some sexy lingerie.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.930
âª

14:14.998 --> 14:19.367
Man, poor kelso's van.

14:19.435 --> 14:21.335
When it finally landed,

14:21.403 --> 14:24.838
It didn't so much crash as completely separate

14:24.906 --> 14:28.575
Into its basic elements and just return to nature.

14:28.642 --> 14:30.643
It was so sad.

14:30.711 --> 14:33.711
There were tootsie rolls everywhere.

14:33.779 --> 14:37.047
Yes, took a nap in my room.

14:37.115 --> 14:40.952
My goose down duvet is like a cocoon.

14:41.020 --> 14:44.688
I laid down a caterpillar and woke up a butterfly.

14:44.756 --> 14:46.689
Maybe you with your room and red with his shoes

14:46.757 --> 14:48.191
Should get a room

14:48.258 --> 14:51.394
And decorate it with red's shoes. Ha! Burn!

14:51.462 --> 14:53.562
Man, you just don't understand what it's like

14:53.630 --> 14:56.197
To have a bed that hugs you
like you're a little baby.

14:56.265 --> 14:59.467
It's like crawling into a mommy kangaroo.

14:59.535 --> 15:02.306
I miss my kangaroo.

15:02.374 --> 15:05.941
Remember when I said that
he should decorate his room

15:06.008 --> 15:07.804
With red's shoes?

15:07.872 --> 15:10.205
Ha! Burn!

15:10.273 --> 15:12.874
(hyde screams)

15:12.941 --> 15:14.274
Hyde's in trouble!

15:14.342 --> 15:18.845
She took it all down.

15:18.913 --> 15:21.113
Did you just scream like a girl?

15:23.381 --> 15:26.984
No.

15:25.752 --> 15:27.686
(sighs)

15:27.754 --> 15:30.888
What happened to my lavender-scented candle?

15:30.956 --> 15:32.356
Did you just say,

15:32.424 --> 15:34.791
"what happened to my lavender-scented candle?"

15:34.859 --> 15:37.960
No.

15:39.296 --> 15:41.497
âª

15:41.564 --> 15:43.298
Thank you.

15:43.366 --> 15:45.634
Oh, okay, so I made appointments

15:45.701 --> 15:47.269
With all the doctors in your address book

15:47.137 --> 15:50.305
'cause I don't know which
one was the woo-woo doctor.

15:50.372 --> 15:52.940
You know what? Stay out of my stuff.

15:53.008 --> 15:54.409
I'll take care of things myself

15:54.477 --> 15:58.478
'cause you obviously aren't
responsible enough to handle it.

15:58.546 --> 16:01.847
Oh, kelso, you're here.

16:01.915 --> 16:04.682
Um, hey, can I borrow your van

16:04.750 --> 16:07.151
For a little experiment?

16:09.053 --> 16:10.353
No.

16:10.421 --> 16:11.921
Oh.

16:11.989 --> 16:16.391
I thought you were gonna say "yes."

16:20.729 --> 16:22.729
Oh, my god.

16:22.797 --> 16:24.998
Is that my steering wheel?

16:25.066 --> 16:27.667
It's the biggest piece I could find.

16:29.504 --> 16:31.471
Listen, kelso, I am so sorry.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.473
I took the van to mount hump,

16:33.541 --> 16:35.475
And I forgot to set the parking brake.

16:35.543 --> 16:37.310
I'm just really sorry.

16:38.378 --> 16:43.048
The horn doesn't honk anymore.

16:43.116 --> 16:45.417
Look, you know, at first, it seemed okay

16:45.485 --> 16:47.586
Because you melted my g.I. Joe.

16:47.654 --> 16:51.456
But I mean, it's not as bad
as destroying a van, so...

16:51.524 --> 16:55.227
I don't know why I just said that.

16:55.295 --> 16:57.362
I don't know what to say.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.031
Well, I do.

16:59.098 --> 17:01.266
You know, I called michael irresponsible,

17:01.234 --> 17:03.168
But he's not. You are.

17:02.635 --> 17:05.403
You're an irresponsible, twitchy little man!

17:07.401 --> 17:09.935
Okay, please, just don't bump me

17:09.964 --> 17:13.199
With that thing.

17:13.267 --> 17:18.103
Wait. If he's irresponsible,

17:18.170 --> 17:21.438
That means I'm the good one.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.740
I'm the good one now!

17:23.808 --> 17:28.278
Yeah, he's obviously the dumb one of your group.

17:28.346 --> 17:30.479
Hey, he really is.

17:32.716 --> 17:36.318
âª

17:37.787 --> 17:38.888
Red forman, don't you dare

17:38.956 --> 17:40.623
Throw those shoes away.

17:40.691 --> 17:42.558
I just can't keep 'em, kitty.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.559
Every time I wear them,

17:44.627 --> 17:47.695
I'll feel bob touching my feet.

17:50.065 --> 17:52.133
Are you throwing away my shoes?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.467
No, no, no, no.

17:53.535 --> 17:55.336
He is not throwing away your shoes.

17:55.404 --> 17:58.438
He is getting rid of that pesky new shoe smell

17:58.506 --> 18:00.807
By rubbing old food on them.

18:02.509 --> 18:04.543
I'm throwing them away, bob.

18:04.611 --> 18:08.914
Look, I appreciate the thought.
No, well, that's not true.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.315
I mean...

18:10.383 --> 18:14.285
Shoes are a weird gift to give another man.

18:14.353 --> 18:17.321
I mean, what's next? A weekend in cancun?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.723
Okay, fine. I bought the shoes for myself,

18:19.791 --> 18:21.692
But they pinched my toes,

18:21.760 --> 18:24.961
So I decided to pawn 'emff on you as a gift.

18:25.029 --> 18:27.695
You were just trying to screw me over?

18:29.096 --> 18:31.898
Well, I can respect that.

18:31.966 --> 18:35.734
Thanks for the shoes, bob.

18:35.802 --> 18:38.002
See, I have a friend.

18:38.070 --> 18:40.538
No, no. This is not the way friends act.

18:40.606 --> 18:42.707
He was gonna throw away your present, bob.

18:42.775 --> 18:44.775
Come on, kitty. I gave him shoes.

18:44.843 --> 18:46.712
That's weird.

18:48.749 --> 18:51.484
I'm surprised you didn't punch
me in the face right then.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.386
I almost did.

18:53.453 --> 18:56.254
(laughing)

18:56.322 --> 18:59.957
âª

19:01.525 --> 19:02.792
Jackie, what the hell?

19:02.959 --> 19:04.468
Why'd you take everything down?

19:05.635 --> 19:07.170
You said, "take everything down."

19:07.687 --> 19:08.721
Well, you didn't have to.

19:08.788 --> 19:10.322
You said, "you have to."

19:10.390 --> 19:11.656
I didn't mean it.

19:11.724 --> 19:14.025
You said, "I mean it."

19:14.093 --> 19:15.927
Look, just put it all back.

19:15.994 --> 19:18.429
Not until you admit you loved it.

19:18.496 --> 19:20.597
Jackie, who cares who's right or wrong here?

19:20.665 --> 19:23.366
Isn't the important thing that you make me happy?

19:23.434 --> 19:27.303
Who are you talking to? Do you even know me?

19:27.370 --> 19:30.372
Fine. I loved it.

19:30.439 --> 19:32.474
And...?

19:32.541 --> 19:35.977
The twinkle lights were breathtaking.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.481
And...?

19:41.549 --> 19:45.818
The scented candles made
me feel like laura ingalls.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.587
All right, that's it.

19:50.655 --> 19:53.056
We need to find another place to get married.

19:53.124 --> 19:53.958
I just wrote out,

19:54.025 --> 19:57.093
"you are cordial invited to mount hump,"

19:57.161 --> 19:59.328
And I died a little inside.

19:59.396 --> 20:01.630
Well, then I guess we should also rule out

20:01.698 --> 20:04.233
The scenic banks of nipple creek.

20:05.402 --> 20:07.469
Where is michael?

20:07.537 --> 20:09.771
You know, whenever he tells
me he has a surprise for me,

20:09.839 --> 20:10.973
It makes me a little nervous.

20:10.841 --> 20:12.776
It's probably just 'cause the last time

20:12.843 --> 20:15.378
He said that to you, you got pregnant.

20:17.013 --> 20:20.349
Tires squeal)

20:26.787 --> 20:27.921
So what do you think?

20:28.789 --> 20:30.123
I think barbie's probably worried sick

20:30.190 --> 20:32.858
That her convertible's missing.

20:33.926 --> 20:35.860
I thought you were getting another van.

20:35.928 --> 20:37.361
Oh, so did I,

20:37.429 --> 20:39.363
But then I saw this baby
down at the police auction,

20:39.431 --> 20:41.365
And I knew it was destined to be mine.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.900
Well, hey, man, can I give you some money?

20:43.968 --> 20:47.770
No, it was pretty cheap.
Some guy got stabbed in it.

20:50.974 --> 20:52.275
So nobody else bid on it.

20:52.343 --> 20:53.543
It's pretty sweet, huh?

20:53.611 --> 20:54.811
It's frickin' awesome.

20:54.879 --> 20:57.013
Is it the car, or are you more handsome?

20:57.080 --> 21:00.182
It's the car.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.018
And I'm more handsome.

21:03.785 --> 21:06.420
Michael, don't you think
it's a little impractical?

21:06.488 --> 21:07.888
Impractical?

21:07.956 --> 21:10.557
<i>More like imperfecticable.</i>

21:12.025 --> 21:14.195
This thing is totally baby-friendly.

21:15.263 --> 21:17.364
Remind me again how it's baby-friendly.

21:17.432 --> 21:21.102
Cause it's tiny, just like a baby.

21:25.123 --> 21:27.324
(manly voice) barbie, you are
gross, but I still love you.

21:28.192 --> 21:29.625
(high-pitched voice) really?

21:29.693 --> 21:33.962
Even though my face is melted off?

21:34.030 --> 21:36.598
(manly voice) yes, but your perfect plastic boobs

21:36.465 --> 21:38.833
Remain untouched jewels.

21:38.901 --> 21:44.137
(high-pitched voice) oh,
can my twin sister watch?

21:44.205 --> 21:45.871
(manly voice) why just watch?

21:45.939 --> 21:48.641
There's plenty of joe to go around.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.176
I didn't see you.
