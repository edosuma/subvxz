02:03.090 --> 02:06.860
- How d'you know all of this?
- I asked Gary.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.298
Gary? So none of this
has come from Robert then?

02:11.398 --> 02:13.901
You've never even talked to him, have you?

02:14.001 --> 02:15.871
Um...

02:16.470 --> 02:17.998
No...

02:18.098 --> 02:21.608
but, like, Gary said he's like
proper fucked up his arm.

02:21.708 --> 02:25.451
- Like ripped the skin right off.
- Holly, I don't wanna know.

02:27.047 --> 02:31.850
I'd love it if my boyfriend tried
to kill himself 'cause I died.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.657
But he didn't kill himself, did he?

02:36.757 --> 02:39.827
He's back here, stacking shelves
on minimum wage.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.196
All right, but...

02:42.296 --> 02:45.397
imagine being fucked
by someone that intense.

02:47.168 --> 02:51.438
Has anyone ever told you
you're a really weird little girl?

02:51.538 --> 02:54.775
Anyway don't kid yourself.
You don't wanna fuck him.

02:54.875 --> 02:59.246
You wanna be the one that IDs the body
when he finally gets it right.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.616
Nah. She wants to save him.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.451
Don't ya?

03:04.551 --> 03:06.954
You won't be able to fix him, Holly.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.921
If she ever speaks to him, that is.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.559
You've been like my angel.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.721
Like everything with Mum and Dad
and crap and all that shit with Steve.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.868
I don't know. I just don't think that...

03:20.968 --> 03:23.969
Look, it's not been working
for a while, has it?

03:26.507 --> 03:29.843
I'm sorry about the bear.
I just wanted to, you know.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.331
- Can we be friends?
- Oh...

03:32.431 --> 03:35.516
Yeah. No, that would be cool.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.349
Of course we can be friends.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.585
So you're not...

03:43.257 --> 03:45.259
You're okay?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.577
Yeah.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.633
I just think I'm a bit...

03:52.733 --> 03:55.318
a bit dark for you.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.340
Dark?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.958
I mean... I mean...

04:03.911 --> 04:06.530
You're a bit vanilla.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.968
- What?
- I mean, you're just so nice.

04:14.621 --> 04:18.492
Not that that's... I mean, it's great.
You're a lovely person and...

04:18.591 --> 04:22.846
Fuck off, David.
You know nothing about me.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.439
Whoa! Whoa! Easy!

04:52.225 --> 04:54.077
You okay?

05:00.834 --> 05:03.481
Samira, get a mop, clean this up, yeah?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.912
Let me have a look.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.665
I'm a paramedic.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.466
I'm a paramedic...

05:32.666 --> 05:34.501
trainee.

05:34.901 --> 05:39.640
I'm a student when I'm not here
at the supermarket.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.558
Can I?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.963
I heard you came off your bike.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.262
I'm gonna sell it.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.519
I thought it'd be better in the open air.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.421
At least you're not in a box.

06:27.521 --> 06:31.074
You know, you should have kept
this moist. It might scar now.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.546
I know. They told me.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.094
What you listening to?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.236
What are you listening to?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.651
What do you think?

07:52.339 --> 07:55.008
- You don't like it, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.061
No, you don't.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.137
Orange?

08:15.611 --> 08:17.975
That's a pomegranate.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.283
Whatever. It's free.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.902
What made you talk to me?

10:02.502 --> 10:04.671
No one else in that place does.

10:05.571 --> 10:09.363
They stare at me and treat me
like I'm gonna kill myself.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.563
Well, you do a pretty good impression.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.038
Come on!

10:29.138 --> 10:31.407
It's the short cut!

10:32.199 --> 10:34.551
Cinema's over there!

11:19.545 --> 11:23.298
You're too good for me,
and I don't want to hurt you.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.203
You're not going to.

11:31.457 --> 11:35.629
Now, the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice
I'm wearing a funny costume today.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.965
But the thing is that's
out of respect for the uniform.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.700
You don't go shopping in it.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.670
You don't go down to the pub in it,
even though you think you might pull in it.

11:45.572 --> 11:49.910
It's not just a uniform for me.
It tells the whole world who I am.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.913
Even though we're all here,
none of us are wearing green.

11:53.013 --> 11:57.050
But don't forget.
You are different from the others here.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.820
You're not a media student,
not a sports science student.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.322
You're training to be a paramedic.

12:02.422 --> 12:06.139
And training doesn't begin when you
put on the uniform. It starts up here.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.767
<i> Three Ds. Discipline.</i>

12:13.867 --> 12:16.503
<i>You're not just wearing
the uniform to look good.</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:23.633
<i>Determination. To live up
to what the uniform means.</i>

12:25.712 --> 12:28.297
<i>And finally, most importantly of all...</i>

12:31.484 --> 12:33.320
<i>distance.</i>

12:33.420 --> 12:37.106
<i>When you put on that uniform,
it sets you apart from others.</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:44.464
<i>Doesn't make you superhuman.</i>

12:44.664 --> 12:47.984
Some people you will not save.

13:33.513 --> 13:38.268
Oh, shit! Rob, I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.239
You're so sweet.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.459
Oh, my God.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.974
Fuck me.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.672
Oh, fuck yeah.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.364
Oh, fuck. Yeah, grab my feet.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.116
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.021
I'm not holding your feet.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.653
Oh, God, not again.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.998
What the...

16:57.717 --> 16:59.802
Where...

17:10.096 --> 17:11.614
Rob?

17:16.502 --> 17:18.054
Are you there?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.625
What's going on?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.767
Nina?

17:32.418 --> 17:34.436
Rob.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.775
It is you.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.134
Rob.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.575
What is happening?

17:58.344 --> 18:00.695
Who's this?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.332
You're dead.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.937
You're... you're dead.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.989
Who the fuck is this girl?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.932
Rob, who is this?

18:20.032 --> 18:23.920
Come on, Rob, introduce us.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.768
Nina...

18:41.321 --> 18:44.289
this is Holly, who...

18:45.992 --> 18:49.278
works in the supermarket with me.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.582
Holly...

18:56.402 --> 18:59.531
this is Nina...

19:00.224 --> 19:01.875
- my...
- Girlfriend.

19:02.025 --> 19:03.326
Dead...

19:03.876 --> 19:05.843
Girlfriend.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.031
This isn't...

19:10.583 --> 19:13.235
This isn't happening!

19:23.062 --> 19:25.615
How could you, Rob?

19:26.932 --> 19:29.702
Rob, she isn't real.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.705
She... isn't!

19:34.006 --> 19:36.376
How old is she?

19:37.076 --> 19:39.579
No, you can't...

19:39.979 --> 19:42.048
You're dead!

19:42.148 --> 19:46.542
Sure, but I've kept my standards.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.090
I mean...

19:51.690 --> 19:53.809
supermarket?

20:00.666 --> 20:03.453
Holly, just go. You...

20:06.605 --> 20:09.909
This... this is my...

20:10.009 --> 20:14.580
Uh, you should just go.
You can. You should just leave me.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.083
This has to be a dream.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.018
Oh, fuck!

20:19.418 --> 20:21.803
Can't be real.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.010
I can't believe this.

20:29.862 --> 20:33.533
You're my boyfriend's dead ex-girlfriend.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.983
You think I'm his ex ex? I'm not.

20:37.083 --> 20:40.907
And don't even think about calling me
his late ex-girlfriend

20:41.007 --> 20:44.911
because that gives completely
the wrong impression.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.920
I'm not an ex.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.649
You're dead!

20:49.749 --> 20:52.268
That doesn't mean
we're on a break though, does it?

20:54.186 --> 20:56.838
Get the fuck out of my bedroom.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.972
You have to help me, my love.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.478
I can't. I can't. Please.

21:18.978 --> 21:23.316
I think I remember six or seven seconds.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.952
My mouth filled with my own blood.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.204
- And then no change.
- Rob.

21:28.304 --> 21:30.657
Just the mortuary slab...

21:31.357 --> 21:35.995
with you and Dad
bonding over my naked body.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.198
I don't want this.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.117
And then the funeral.

21:43.335 --> 21:47.139
Then you... and her.

21:47.439 --> 21:48.941
I don't want this.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.694
Rob, just move.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.602
Kiss me, Rob.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.812
Kiss me, beautiful.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.534
Kissing you isn't how it used to be.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.073
Ow!

22:38.824 --> 22:41.710
- Holly!
- Ow, fuck!

22:47.332 --> 22:49.350
Fuck's sake.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.257
Wait here for a minute.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.166
Holly!

22:56.266 --> 22:58.760
Holly, wait.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.182
Fuck.

24:27.566 --> 24:30.470
Oh, you'll check your phone
whilst giving mouth-to-mouth, will you?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.806
Hello? Yeah, uh... Ah, we lost him.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.826
Shame, I know, but I did get
a text from my boyfriend.

24:36.976 --> 24:41.013
Oh, sorry, I don't mean boyfriend.
I mean supermarket fuck buddy.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.516
Keep pumping the chest.
You don't want to lose him.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.652
- The doll, I mean, not the...
- Fuck off, Josh.

25:08.674 --> 25:12.411
You all right?
Look like you've seen a ghost.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.614
How are things going
with your sexy suicidal guy?

25:15.714 --> 25:17.828
Has he mentioned her yet,

25:17.928 --> 25:19.902
dead girlfriend?

25:21.003 --> 25:23.455
It came up, yeah.

28:47.026 --> 28:50.296
I don't quite know how to say this, so...

28:50.896 --> 28:53.794
I'm just going to go ahead and say it.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.689
Have you met someone?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.349
Sorry.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.451
That sounds so...

29:12.801 --> 29:14.637
I just mean...

29:14.737 --> 29:17.077
I mean you can.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.837
I haven't.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.232
But you can.

29:27.466 --> 29:32.337
You should know that you can move on...

29:32.437 --> 29:34.848
if you want to.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.628
It's okay.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.635
We all need to move on.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.068
God, the bulbs are out, did you see?

30:03.168 --> 30:05.553
First sign of spring.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.773
Yeah.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.959
Spring would be nice.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.933
Is Rob here yet?

30:19.033 --> 30:22.221
Yes, he's in the front room. He's...

30:22.721 --> 30:25.891
- I think he's come off his bike again.
- Oh, God, is he still doing that?

30:25.991 --> 30:29.644
- Don't mention it.
- Of course I won't.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.298
Hey, Rob.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.550
Good to see you.

30:37.469 --> 30:41.206
- How's things?
- Yeah. You know.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.058
Yeah.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.712
Yep.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.615
Drink before the performance.
I've certainly earned it.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.817
- Have you been writing?
- Well, I call it that.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.436
Did you get to read
that chapter I sent you?

30:54.536 --> 30:56.305
That's how Martin Amis does it, Rob.

30:56.405 --> 30:59.141
Gets all his feedback
from reluctant dinner guests.

30:59.241 --> 31:01.700
Rob's not reluctant, is he?

31:01.800 --> 31:04.942
- Why does he come here every week?
- Well, not to read your book.

31:05.042 --> 31:07.633
- You don't mind, do you, Rob?
- How's he going to answer that?

31:07.733 --> 31:09.902
He's a free man.
He can say whatever he wants.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.771
When did she do the painting
in the front room?

31:12.871 --> 31:16.275
It was her A-level piece.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.510
Very strong.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.845
Best one there.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.947
Just gonna use the loo.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.499
Have you thought any more about...

31:40.599 --> 31:42.985
starting up your studies again?

31:44.269 --> 31:46.506
I'm not sure.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.509
Feel like my maths brain has dried up.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.479
- Seems a bit pointless.
- And working in a supermarket isn't...

31:53.579 --> 31:57.216
You're sounding like
a nagging grandmother, Sal.

31:57.716 --> 32:01.812
So... how's that motorbike of yours, Rob?

32:02.854 --> 32:05.571
Quite a mean machine you've got there.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.495
Yeah. It's fine.

32:09.895 --> 32:13.056
I used to have a Moto Guzzi myself once.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.585
This is ridiculous.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.426
Fine machine.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.019
Come on, while we have a moment.

32:37.022 --> 32:40.041
Shall we adjourn to the parlor?

32:49.167 --> 32:51.052
Here.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.509
Oh, sorry! Um...

33:01.613 --> 33:04.766
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.359
Do you mind?

33:13.759 --> 33:16.086
No. Of course.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.581
Oh, you don't have to read it now.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.771
I just really like this bit.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.373
"Silvio Bulge pissed.

33:28.473 --> 33:31.639
Reaching inside himself,
he ejaculated piss

33:31.739 --> 33:33.679
in the urinal before him.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.514
Reaching inside himself,

33:35.614 --> 33:39.752
he pissed in the way only men can,

33:40.252 --> 33:42.004
with his hands."

33:44.589 --> 33:47.620
You know what I mean? That just came out!

33:48.860 --> 33:52.380
"With his hands." You know.

33:53.665 --> 33:57.139
I will. I'll... definitely
read the rest of this.

33:57.239 --> 34:00.038
This is all a new thing for me.

34:00.138 --> 34:04.943
But that... that's why
it's so good, you know?

34:05.143 --> 34:09.715
Scary, but exciting, you know?

34:09.815 --> 34:12.123
It'd be good for you to...

34:13.324 --> 34:17.922
I mean, uh...
Not that it has to be that PhD.

34:18.422 --> 34:20.641
You could do anything, Rob.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.812
Don't let her put you off.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.748
Take care, won't you?

34:29.368 --> 34:32.186
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.609
Is she...

36:57.315 --> 36:59.048
Do you want her to be?

37:00.319 --> 37:02.137
No.

37:04.589 --> 37:08.210
- I thought you'd gone.
- You stopped texting.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.813
There you go.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.919
Jesus, you're freezing.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.589
She'll be there.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.941
We can cope.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.522
What?

38:39.517 --> 38:41.797
Are you okay?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.051
Okay.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.366
Kiss me. Kiss me.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.320
You're so warm.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.539
Thank you, Holly.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.980
It's not gonna work.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.270
I have tinnitus.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.441
And these lights zigzagging in my eyes.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.709
I have a shard of glass
in the back of my throat...

42:30.815 --> 42:33.768
and that's about all I can feel.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.288
You might as well stop.

42:37.988 --> 42:41.244
- I wanna make you happy.
- Stop.

42:57.442 --> 42:59.860
He's using you.

43:05.216 --> 43:07.252
God, Rob, she is young.

43:07.352 --> 43:10.253
Naked, you could pass for 16.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.692
- You're not old.
- No.

43:13.792 --> 43:16.111
I'm dead.

43:16.961 --> 43:18.496
If I was just his old girlfriend,

43:18.596 --> 43:22.907
then I could see why you'd get
your frothy little hopes up, but...

43:23.568 --> 43:25.220
come on.

43:26.028 --> 43:31.184
That first morning when I was naked
in the sunshine by the window...

43:32.944 --> 43:38.108
pushing his hands into the sand
as we fucked on the beach in Cornwall.

43:38.917 --> 43:42.387
Or the time I went down on him
on the sofa in my parents' front room,

43:42.487 --> 43:45.340
just before he met them
for the first time.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.769
These things will stay in his head

43:57.869 --> 44:01.113
precisely because I am dead.

44:02.290 --> 44:04.466
You're an oil painting that's still wet.

44:04.876 --> 44:09.893
Any good memories you slather out will
just get mushed in by what happens next.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.813
I have no next.

44:18.923 --> 44:20.708
Nina.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.796
Holly is my girlfriend now.

44:26.296 --> 44:30.171
I don't know how we're gonna deal with
this... situation, but that's just how it is.

44:30.401 --> 44:33.371
No, it isn't. We never broke up.

44:33.471 --> 44:35.940
- You died. I couldn't.
- Did you want to?

44:36.040 --> 44:38.626
- No.
- Well, then.

44:41.412 --> 44:43.414
- I'm breaking up with you now.
- You can't.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.450
- What do you mean? Why not?
- Because I'm dead.

44:46.550 --> 44:50.288
- Didn't change you very much, did it?
- Well, that's sort of the point.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.423
Why do you always have
to be like this when we row?

44:52.523 --> 44:55.694
I'm not being like anything. I'm dead.

44:55.794 --> 44:58.730
I'm very literally not being
like anything at all.

44:59.430 --> 45:02.400
Holly is my girlfriend, and you are dead,

45:02.500 --> 45:05.420
and that means
that we can't be together anymore.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.823
You can't expect me to be
on my own for the rest of my life.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.391
You're not.

45:17.315 --> 45:20.067
This doesn't mean I'm gonna forget you.

45:24.522 --> 45:29.043
What the fuck do you think
you mean by that?

45:31.379 --> 45:33.397
You're impossible.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.206
I never know what you want.

45:42.306 --> 45:46.194
I don't want anything.

48:08.920 --> 48:12.991
I think that I should give her a memorial.

48:13.091 --> 48:17.797
I know there's a grave
but she's not there, is she?

48:18.963 --> 48:22.066
Besides, I want to show her how I feel.

48:29.207 --> 48:31.876
You know, you were right about her grave.

48:31.976 --> 48:35.981
She's not there.
She's not anyplace, is she?

48:36.981 --> 48:40.685
I used to take flowers to the road
where she died, but...

48:41.185 --> 48:43.554
it's just a field with a broken fence.

48:43.654 --> 48:45.836
You know, what matters...

48:45.936 --> 48:48.799
all that matters is us.

48:48.899 --> 48:51.262
You, me...

48:51.662 --> 48:54.198
Sally and Dan,

48:54.298 --> 48:56.534
what we carry with us.

48:56.634 --> 49:00.238
Like when I came off my bike
the first time, I...

49:01.138 --> 49:03.474
I wanted a lorry to come.

49:03.574 --> 49:07.679
I wanted to be crushed. Lose my legs or...

49:08.579 --> 49:12.337
I wanted scars, so she'd always be there.

49:15.319 --> 49:20.107
But you're right. This is better.

49:21.626 --> 49:25.774
She drew it on my T-shirt one night
when we were out to wind me up.

49:25.874 --> 49:29.965
She'd... she'd decided I'd die first.

49:30.868 --> 49:34.605
Put a picture of me being eaten by sharks.
Put my name and a date.

49:35.205 --> 49:38.610
So I said, "What about you?"
She said she'd never die...

49:38.710 --> 49:40.650
and wrote it underneath.

49:40.750 --> 49:44.382
So was it after her crash
that you had it done?

49:44.782 --> 49:46.951
Nope. That night.

49:47.051 --> 49:50.688
Neither of us felt permanent marker
was permanent enough.

49:50.988 --> 49:54.258
Her art was all about leaving a mark,

49:54.358 --> 49:56.676
like a needle in a record.

50:02.967 --> 50:05.288
She loved letterpress.

50:05.936 --> 50:08.255
Old printing.

50:13.344 --> 50:16.564
Seeing the indentation.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.735
The impression stuff made always...

50:24.889 --> 50:27.340
Are you sure you wanna hear all this shit?

50:27.725 --> 50:30.911
Yeah, of course.

51:02.091 --> 51:04.577
Don't know why you bought white.

51:14.004 --> 51:19.310
What the hell, Rob?
You're branding them now?

51:19.410 --> 51:21.372
It was her idea.

51:22.312 --> 51:24.849
I know what this is about.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.819
You're scared you'll be forgotten.

51:28.519 --> 51:32.772
You don't want me
to take your place. I won't.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.110
I never will.

51:41.498 --> 51:44.672
You can go now. I'm honoring you.

51:45.402 --> 51:47.206
Jesus wept.

51:48.406 --> 51:53.911
You're a very silly little girl,
aren't you, Holly?

51:54.011 --> 51:56.447
This has nothing to do with me.

51:57.247 --> 51:59.266
It's him.

52:03.321 --> 52:05.373
Oblivion would beat this.

52:05.723 --> 52:08.859
Would beat lying next
to the heat of your heart

52:08.959 --> 52:13.031
beating in your little living chest.

52:13.831 --> 52:19.103
The smell of your sweet stink
rising between your legs

52:19.203 --> 52:23.258
as my boy puts his hand inside your pussy.

52:24.308 --> 52:28.069
Nina, don't do this. I'm just...

52:28.169 --> 52:31.449
- I'm trying to help. I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

52:32.249 --> 52:35.870
You didn't even notice
I didn't do anything this time.

52:35.970 --> 52:40.875
You just rode him
like a little toy rocking horse.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.761
No. Last time you said...

52:43.861 --> 52:46.431
I'm not doing this to get off.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.021
I don't want this.

52:50.468 --> 52:53.954
I don't... want.

53:00.544 --> 53:02.396
Fine.

53:04.782 --> 53:08.319
Far as I'm concerned, the least you
could have done was leave me a book.

53:08.419 --> 53:10.488
Right now that'll be my pleasure.

53:10.588 --> 53:14.124
You know, I'll fuck him
all day and all night

53:14.224 --> 53:16.527
and leave a fucking library for you.

53:16.627 --> 53:19.680
You won't drive me away.

53:22.132 --> 53:26.186
Trust me. I don't intend to drive again.

53:27.772 --> 53:30.324
I've had a bad experience.

53:31.876 --> 53:35.029
Rob, are you...
are you going to say anything?

53:37.181 --> 53:39.633
What can I say?

53:42.653 --> 53:44.944
I love you.

53:47.124 --> 53:49.927
But it's me he can't forget.

53:50.827 --> 53:52.930
I'm honoring you.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.182
You won't be forgotten.

53:55.282 --> 53:58.919
Don't you see? That is the problem.

53:59.569 --> 54:04.779
And you've certainly made that one worse.

54:12.216 --> 54:15.335
- Do you want her to come back?
- No.

54:16.820 --> 54:19.635
But I don't know how to make her stop.

54:29.700 --> 54:33.319
Would you meet Nina's parents,
Sally and Dan?

54:34.338 --> 54:36.941
O... okay, but I...

54:37.741 --> 54:40.411
- How's that gonna...
- I think I need you to.

54:40.911 --> 54:45.850
You know, to... show them I'm moving on.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.996
With you.

54:48.752 --> 54:51.030
Perhaps she'll accept it too.

55:32.580 --> 55:35.015
So what the hell was that, Rob?

55:35.465 --> 55:36.862
I'm sorry I forgot to ask.

55:36.962 --> 55:40.571
Is there anything you don't eat, Holly?
We're having a roast.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.983
Um...

55:43.083 --> 55:45.534
I'm a vegetarian.

55:46.577 --> 55:47.968
Oh. Um...

55:48.068 --> 55:52.056
well, there's potatoes and peas.

55:54.685 --> 55:59.539
It's no bother.
I'll, um... I can do omelet.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.976
I didn't think it would go like that.

56:08.498 --> 56:11.969
- Dan's writing a novel.
- Oh, cool. Is that what you do?

56:12.069 --> 56:13.654
Uh...

56:15.706 --> 56:18.142
No. It's a...

56:18.742 --> 56:19.875
It's a new thing.

56:19.975 --> 56:24.615
Our friend the maths PhD over there
helped me set up my writing den.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.684
And every Sunday poor old Rob

56:26.784 --> 56:29.653
has to come over and give his opinion
on the latest chapters.

56:29.753 --> 56:31.590
Every Sunday?

56:35.025 --> 56:37.860
Why don't I know about your PhD, Rob?

56:37.960 --> 56:40.998
- Why don't I know anything about you?
- What?

56:41.098 --> 56:44.183
Should I be writing equations
on the fucking windows?

56:50.407 --> 56:52.825
Are you all right?

56:58.649 --> 57:00.685
I'm sorry.

57:01.885 --> 57:04.137
It's just...

57:06.524 --> 57:08.108
It's just...

57:15.365 --> 57:17.415
What just happened?

57:17.515 --> 57:20.708
- You're sitting in Nina's chair.
- Oh, my God.

57:22.306 --> 57:25.343
What was with the mum, Rob? What was that?

57:26.043 --> 57:29.213
- If I can help in any way...
- No, just leave him to it.

57:29.313 --> 57:31.558
If there's anything I can do...

57:33.150 --> 57:37.160
It's just something we all
have to live with, isn't it?

57:37.560 --> 57:40.621
We just have to keep on living.

57:41.992 --> 57:44.074
Don't we, Rob?

57:49.767 --> 57:52.202
So, Holly, what books do you like?

57:52.302 --> 57:54.296
I don't really... textbooks.

57:54.396 --> 57:59.128
But I mean I don't really
enjoy reading those.

57:59.442 --> 58:03.481
So do you really have to go to university
to be an ambulance driver?

58:03.981 --> 58:05.632
Paramedic.

58:05.732 --> 58:09.480
So first time away from home.

58:09.583 --> 58:12.723
I bet your mother misses you.
What are you, 20?

58:12.823 --> 58:15.542
Uh, no, I'm 19.

58:19.929 --> 58:24.618
I guess Rob is your first
proper boyfriend.

58:34.978 --> 58:37.197
They need me.

58:38.782 --> 58:42.319
Fine. Whatever.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.405
Holly!

58:47.591 --> 58:50.844
Excuse me, I'm just... thank you.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.536
I'm sorry.

59:17.955 --> 59:19.706
Holly!

59:21.592 --> 59:24.177
Come on, look, I'm sorry.

59:25.228 --> 59:27.513
Don't ignore me.

59:30.500 --> 59:33.203
Oh, come on, Holly,
stop being so fucking childish.

59:33.303 --> 59:35.906
What's there to talk about?
You wanna fuck your ex-girlfriend's mum.

59:36.006 --> 59:40.628
Fuck off, Holly! Just 'cause I hold her
hand doesn't mean I want to actually...

59:42.145 --> 59:43.847
Can we talk about this somewhere else?

59:43.947 --> 59:46.784
- Do you wanna sit here?
- No, you're fine.

59:47.384 --> 59:50.080
It just felt like I mean nothing to you.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.126
I'm sorry.

59:57.176 --> 59:59.617
I'm all she's got left.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.333
And I wanted her to meet you because...

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.691
I love you.

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:08.858
- Do you?
- Yes...

01:00:08.958 --> 01:00:10.959
I love you.

01:00:12.259 --> 01:00:13.711
Prove it.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:26.540
God, you are dark.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.542
Finally, he realizes!

01:00:37.326 --> 01:00:40.037
- Oh, Jesus, it's fucking cold!
- Shh! Someone will hear us.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.124
I really don't fucking care!

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:57.703
I'm sorry. Oh, fuck yeah.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.185
Say goodbye to her.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.541
Don't you think that's a bit rude?

01:01:10.784 --> 01:01:12.803
Ugh! Fuck!

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:16.306
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Where else would I be?

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.409
I'm not gonna apologize if that's what
you want. We make each other happy!

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:23.814
You don't make happiness. It blooms
on anything you don't scrub too hard.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:26.165
Nina, stop!

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:33.557
You don't think this is love,
do you, Holly?

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:37.044
I mean, sure, he's made you feel useful.

01:01:37.144 --> 01:01:40.230
Every drop of semen
that has trickled down your belly

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:44.935
has been a splash of sunshine
on his grief-stricken brow.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:49.173
But basically you're Florence Nightingale
job-sharing with Linda Lovelace.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:52.726
Jesus, Nina! This is fucking ridiculous.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:00.550
Nina, come on. Is this really
how you want to say goodbye?

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.655
No, but neither was going through
the windscreen of a Triumph Spitfire,

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:07.457
but sometimes
you don't get a choice, honey.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:11.511
Besides... you never can say goodbye.

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.098
Ever.

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.827
What?

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.254
What are you doing here?

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.706
Don't even mention the word "closure."

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.011
Face it, Holly.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:32.349
You've been swaddled and carried
your whole life through.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.285
All these fucking lectures?

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.387
You know nothing.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.456
You mean nothing.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:42.859
To him or me.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:48.514
- You can't even put your own trousers on.
- Would you just stop?

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.457
Nina.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:04.464
This is the end, Nina.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:11.538
I'm saying goodbye to you now.

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.661
I'm never gonna see you again.

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:20.647
Poor Rob.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:28.179
I'm clearing everything out of the flat.

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:33.644
There's not going to be
a single trace of you left.

01:03:40.277 --> 01:03:42.807
I think he's going to ask you
to move in with him.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.357
Do you think you can manage that, Holly?

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.528
Living in my house?

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:56.093
Do you really think you can eradicate
every last trace of me?

01:03:57.868 --> 01:03:59.686
Yes.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.441
I love you, Holly.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.263
Yes.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.156
After you.

01:04:58.545 --> 01:05:02.252
You know you won't be able to see
her parents anymore, right?

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.604
I mean, if this is gonna work.

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:10.693
Yeah, no, yeah.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.492
I figured.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.861
Would a car be useful?

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:50.981
What d'you mean?

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:52.716
For you.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:58.005
Now that you're here,
rather than on campus.

01:05:58.105 --> 01:06:00.381
Yeah, all right.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.811
What if I sold the bike?

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.602
- Rob, you can't do that.
- What?

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:15.955
I don't ride it. It's a waste.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:20.894
I think walking
is all I'm about ready for.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.581
Yup. That's where mine used to go.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:04.341
Can't believe you threw all my shit away.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:07.577
The least you could've done
was gone to Oxfam.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.529
Yup. There too.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:42.395
Well, this is weird.
Why do you think I'm still here?

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.849
Okay, ignore it.

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:49.959
Good idea, sugar lump.
You can finish reading it for me.

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:53.139
Fuck you, Nina.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.598
You already tried that.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.143
Rob is never gonna see you again.

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.546
You missed a bit.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.645
Hiya! Did you see
the letterpress sold on eBay?

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:59.999
I said we'd deliver it, could be
your first trip in your new car.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.311
Holly, what the fuck?
Why is this all white?

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.890
Is that... a new top?

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:12.783
If I was her, I'd want you
for myself for the whole weekend!

01:13:12.883 --> 01:13:16.982
You know what I mean. You deserve it.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.614
Thanks.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:28.621
I don't just mean, um...

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:32.925
I couldn't get through without you.

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.162
Sorry.

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.752
I don't mean to offload on you.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:45.871
No, it's... it's okay.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:52.093
I can't even walk out on him, can I?

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:03.673
I mean, I could...

01:14:04.123 --> 01:14:06.242
walk out of here.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:11.206
But it's all the other stuff, you know.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:17.922
How can you take 30 years of hang-ups
into a new relationship?

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:21.841
Wouldn't stand a chance, would it?

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.400
Oh, you won't leave us, will you?

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.058
No.

01:14:32.158 --> 01:14:34.443
No, of course not.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:40.507
This'll be good though, won't it?
Get to see the sea.

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:45.687
Drop this off to them in the morning.
Make a weekend of it.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:49.635
Go to the beach. We could do anything.

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.843
What are you doing?

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.780
- I dropped my phone.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:05.902
Getting out of here
will do us both a world of good.

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.720
You're driving.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.591
Yup. Sure.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.591
All right, mate?

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.349
After all that, I bet they don't want it.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.019
"It didn't look that heavy on eBay."

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.873
Don't mess me about, old man.
I'm a motherfucking Power Seller.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:17.834
So what d'you want to do now?
Fancy that chip shop we passed?

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:21.104
Ah! Oh! What are you doing?

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.222
Printing.

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.338
Stay still!

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.384
Oh, shit.

01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:32.515
So... what's happening
about fish and chips then?

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:02.466
Oh, my God.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:18.487
- Scratch me.
- Hmm?

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.572
Scratch me.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.992
Make me bleed.

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:26.111
I don't want to.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:37.089
Wuss.

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:45.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on.
You'll break your arm.

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.766
You are such a pussy.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:57.226
- Ow!
- Nina! Please! Stop!

01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:00.046
Shut up, Rob. This is what she wanted.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.368
This is what darkness is, Holly.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.924
Flesh trapped between metal.

01:20:08.134 --> 01:20:10.272
Metal on bone.

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:13.109
Almost makes me nostalgic.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.655
Oh, I can almost taste the petrol.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:21.350
- Please, I don't want this.
- Tough... shit.

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:25.136
You won. You fixed him.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:28.858
Shame you don't want him anymore.

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.179
What do you want, Nina?

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.362
Nothing.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:37.180
Honey, you know it's not me
bringing me back.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:43.358
Even if he's not here,
you've let me under your skin.

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:47.459
This is what you've won.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:52.298
I'll always be here.

01:20:52.398 --> 01:20:56.452
It's not true. It's my fault.
It's all my fault.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:58.604
Get off!

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:01.732
You should thank me, really.

01:21:01.832 --> 01:21:04.943
Now is definitely
the right time to end it.

01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:09.398
You're not ready for someone
who doesn't need fixing, Holly.

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:13.235
A quiet job, pint on the weekends,

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:17.497
it's rushing towards you,
coming to crush you.

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:21.510
Oh, fuck! Are you okay?

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.864
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

01:21:26.122 --> 01:21:28.901
It's got nothing to do with you, Rob.

01:21:33.789 --> 01:21:35.709
I can't.

01:21:36.059 --> 01:21:38.717
I can't do this anymore.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.880
I can't look at you without seeing her.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:53.383
It's never going to work out, is it?

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:04.020
If you don't mind me saying...

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:08.617
that's a very living way
of looking at the situation.

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:14.164
I mean, from my perspective,
it already hasn't...

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:17.382
worked out.

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:20.686
Right?

01:23:57.099 --> 01:23:59.017
What's happening?

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:01.186
Hello?

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:04.623
Please?

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.625
Uh...

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:45.948
Am I hurt?

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:50.086
Yes, but you're gonna be all right.

01:24:50.186 --> 01:24:52.821
I need you to just keep talking to me.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.057
Just keep talking to me, okay?
Now, what's your name?

01:24:55.157 --> 01:24:58.894
- Cassie.
- Okay, Cassie, my name's Holly.

01:24:58.994 --> 01:25:01.114
You're gonna be okay.

01:25:01.214 --> 01:25:03.932
You're gonna be okay.
Everything's going to be all right.

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.935
Just hold my hand, squeeze my hand.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:08.604
You're gonna be all right.

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:11.307
It's gonna be all right.

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:14.525
Everything is gonna be all right.

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.680
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.632
This is amazing!

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:15.380
I mean, not... I mean everyone.
But we saved someone's life tonight!

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:20.976
Look, take this. You're gonna freeze.

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:23.645
I mean, did you see her fucking leg?

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:25.714
I don't know how you kept
your shit together.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:29.551
Don't know how I kept my shit together!
But I mean that's just it, isn't it?

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.588
After that, I'm a fundamentally
changed person, you know?

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:36.987
From now on, everything is different!

01:26:38.755 --> 01:26:40.603
Fuck me!

01:26:40.703 --> 01:26:45.473
Helping people is like...
the baddest drug on Earth, you know?

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:47.986
Whew!

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.362
Who's Nina?

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:50.581
Is she an ex? Holly, are you bi?

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.669
It wasn't...

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:56.122
It wasn't anything.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.025
Okay.

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:05.280
It's not a problem.
I mean, I'm cool with it. I mean...

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.866
I mean, I'm gonna stop talking.

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:16.525
- Not on the bed.
- Huh?

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.026
- Not on the bed!
- Are you okay?

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.345
- Just don't let me think.
- Okay.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.554
So then, Rob, old son,
what's the celebration?

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:33.942
I got a job as a data analyst.

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:37.946
Brilliant! Oh, well done, mate!
That's brilliant news!

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.016
- Yeah, well done.
- Thanks.

01:28:41.116 --> 01:28:43.151
Yeah, and, well...

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.337
thanks.

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:49.541
You know, that's why...

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:54.091
Just... to say thanks.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.353
I see.

01:29:03.639 --> 01:29:06.164
I just mean that...

01:29:06.264 --> 01:29:08.010
this isn't...

01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:11.447
This isn't actually helping
any of us. I mean...

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:15.367
I mean me being...

01:29:15.467 --> 01:29:20.527
the one person you can both
bear to be with isn't exactly...

01:29:20.627 --> 01:29:26.169
- No. That's not fair.
- ...isn't actually helping anyone, is it?

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:30.866
Well, that's funny.

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:33.335
Because I'd say we've been
helping you massively.

01:29:33.435 --> 01:29:34.870
That's not what I'm saying.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:38.192
You think you've been doing
all of it on your own?

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:44.980
You think it's been easy for us,
seeing you?

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.682
Supporting you all through it?

01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:50.152
Helping you get back on your feet,
find a new job,

01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:52.955
shaking you out of the lows,

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.157
all the while...

01:29:55.257 --> 01:30:00.596
having you as a constant reminder
that our daughter is dead

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:02.798
and you're not?

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:04.726
And I do mean that!

01:30:06.419 --> 01:30:08.182
I'm sorry,

01:30:08.282 --> 01:30:11.979
but you can't help but think...

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.910
You can't help...

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:18.313
but look at kids,

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:22.251
I mean, people your age, and not think...

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:28.297
why are they still there, and she isn't?

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:40.302
Like that bloody child you paraded at us

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:43.435
like some fucking ghost of our girl.

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.719
Well, you can do that, Rob.

01:30:47.819 --> 01:30:50.195
You can find someone else. We can't.

01:30:52.548 --> 01:30:55.250
So don't sit there...

01:30:55.350 --> 01:31:00.155
thinking that we've not been
doing anything for you...

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:02.897
because we bloody have.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.345
I'm sorry.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.485
Hold on, Josh, one sec.

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:33.111
What, did I do something wrong?

01:31:42.364 --> 01:31:44.900
You are so kinky!

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.507
Holly...

01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:48.825
I think that...

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.489
Just fuck me.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.254
Please! No!

01:32:15.097 --> 01:32:18.371
Oh, God, Holly, you're amazing!

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.319
Please, no.

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:30.358
Are you coming? I'm gonna come!

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.461
Typical.

01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:35.165
Jesus Christ!

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.626
Ah!

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.845
God, I love this song!

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:49.846
I'm gonna love it forever now.

01:32:52.768 --> 01:32:56.306
This is not what I want.

01:32:57.706 --> 01:33:00.028
Join the club.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.674
Who is it?

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:03.338
Hi.

01:34:03.438 --> 01:34:05.256
Hi.

01:34:08.276 --> 01:34:10.128
You didn't answer my texts.

01:34:14.783 --> 01:34:17.779
Holly, this is stupid. I'm...

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:20.538
I love you.

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:23.959
I'm sorry, Rob.

01:34:24.359 --> 01:34:27.700
- You know this won't work out.
- That's a...

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.999
- I don't know why you say that.
- Yes, you do.

01:34:31.099 --> 01:34:33.168
I had to come here. I had to speak to you.

01:34:33.818 --> 01:34:36.421
I know I didn't do everything I should've,

01:34:36.521 --> 01:34:39.441
but I'm a different person.

01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:42.235
Believe it or not, I'm happy now.

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:12.808
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't you, Rob.

01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:15.793
It was never you.

01:35:32.794 --> 01:35:34.726
Are you gonna be okay?

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:38.016
Yeah.
