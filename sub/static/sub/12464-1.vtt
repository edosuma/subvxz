00:08.041 --> 00:11.777
No, dad, no. Okay.
It needs to go up.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.779
More. More. Up more.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.080
Down a tiny bit.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.950
Perfect. Twin sister
officially welcomed.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.551
Bam! What?!

00:19.553 --> 00:21.687
Okay... mom?
Mm?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.589
Snack update.
Where's Liv's favorite dip?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.158
(Mouth full) Oh, you mean
this dip?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.659
You two are eating the dip?!

00:27.661 --> 00:29.194
This is Wisconsin.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.929
You can't welcome people home
without dip!

00:30.931 --> 00:32.631
You two are officially banned
from the "welcome home" zone!

00:32.633 --> 00:35.234
Maddie, honey, if you're
freaking out

00:35.236 --> 00:37.069
because your sister Liv
is coming home, then...

00:37.071 --> 00:38.871
Then we should talk.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.241
Mom... she's my twin.
My built-in best friend.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.276
I'm not freaking out.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.145
Of course I'm freaking out!

00:46.147 --> 00:48.247
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to school

00:48.249 --> 00:50.182
with my celebrity sis.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.317
And we have the same face,

00:52.319 --> 00:55.020
yet she's
"the cute one."

00:55.022 --> 00:56.722
Hey. Hey, guys.
(Faint clamoring)

00:56.724 --> 00:58.791
There's a bunch of people
with cameras on our lawn.

00:58.793 --> 01:03.262
(Camera shutters clicking)
(Sighs) I'll miss you,
paparazzi.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.230
When I walk through this door,
I will be just

01:05.232 --> 01:08.200
another regular
15-year-old girl.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.970
I just finished the final season
of my smash-tastic TV show...

01:11.972 --> 01:14.740
¶ "sing it loud"

01:14.742 --> 01:16.675
oh... it was one of those
super-realistic shows

01:16.677 --> 01:19.144
where kids suddenly break
into song for no reason.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.246
And I loved Hollywood,
and I was offered,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.082
like, a quizzillion other
shows and movies.

01:23.084 --> 01:27.119
But I missed my family,
and it was time to come home.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.954
(Clamoring,
camera shutters clicking)
(Kisses)

01:28.956 --> 01:31.723
(Jiggles door knob) (Shrieks)

01:33.026 --> 01:34.827
Aah! You stole my face!

01:34.829 --> 01:36.795
I had it first.
Ohh!

01:36.797 --> 01:39.131
(Door closes)

01:39.133 --> 01:41.166
Take notes.
That's what it looks like

01:41.168 --> 01:44.103
when a girl is <i>happy</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

01:44.105 --> 01:46.939
Thanks, Parker. And this is
what it looks like

01:46.941 --> 01:49.374
inside my armpit.
Ohh!

01:52.112 --> 01:55.280
Ohh! I was so worried you guys
had grown up when I was away.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.349
Yeah, there's no chance
of that happening.
(Gasps)

01:57.351 --> 01:59.952
Uh, the people
who gave you life

01:59.954 --> 02:01.987
are still waiting
for their hug.
(Chuckles)

02:03.857 --> 02:06.391
(Sighs) Sorry about
the camera-palooza.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.260
They're just here
for my homecoming.
Oh, who cares?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.129
All my babies
are under one roof.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.064
Pull it in. Tighter.
Family photo time.
Okay.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.932
Okay.
Okay, let me see
if I can do this.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.135
Let me just do this. Okay.
Okay. That's the best angle.

02:16.137 --> 02:23.108
(All talking at once)
Okay. Hold on. Let me...
wait.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.643
(Laughs)
O-okay.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.778
(Shrieks) Mom.
Mom, mom, mom. Mom...
okay. Okay...

02:26.780 --> 02:28.213
I got this. (Shrieks)

02:28.215 --> 02:29.648
(Reporters clamoring,
camera shutters clicking)

02:29.650 --> 02:31.216
Okay, people, say
"dazzleberry!"

02:31.218 --> 02:33.285
(Clicking continues)

02:33.287 --> 02:34.887

02:34.889 --> 02:36.255

02:36.257 --> 02:38.790
¶ Better in stereo

02:38.792 --> 02:41.260

02:41.794 --> 02:43.095

I'm up with the sunshine

02:43.097 --> 02:44.129
(Liv) (Let's go)

02:44.131 --> 02:46.131
I lace up my high tops (Oh no,
(Liv))

02:46.133 --> 02:50.102
Slam dunk, ready or not now show
me what you got

02:50.104 --> 02:52.804

I'm under the spotlight
(Holler(Liv))

02:52.806 --> 02:54.873
I dare you, come on and follow

02:55.108 --> 02:57.109
you dance to your own beat

02:57.111 --> 02:58.810
I'll sing the melody

02:58.812 --> 03:02.881
when you can say yeah, I say no

03:03.116 --> 03:08.120

all I wanna do is go go go

03:08.122 --> 03:10.822

03:10.824 --> 03:12.824
The half I'll never be-e

03:12.826 --> 03:16.828
the half that drives me crazy

03:16.830 --> 03:19.097
you (You) The better half of me
(Me)

03:19.099 --> 03:22.100
The half I'll always need

03:22.102 --> 03:23.869
but we both know

03:24.103 --> 03:26.705
we're better in stereo

03:29.008 --> 03:32.778
okay, returning fashionista,
which glasses should I go with...

03:32.780 --> 03:34.246
green... purple?

03:36.249 --> 03:37.783
Mm... mm... mm.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.185
If I were you,
I'd go with contacts

03:40.187 --> 03:41.853
and a little bit of mascara.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.956
(Laughs)

03:43.958 --> 03:45.424
How great is this?

03:45.426 --> 03:48.427
Liv and Maddie,
back in the same room together?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.295
Oh, I got you a little
welcome-home gift.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.097
(Clicks)
Ta-da!

03:52.099 --> 03:55.000
(Shrieks) O... m... wowza!

03:55.002 --> 03:56.468
Take a diva moment.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.470
(Shrieks)

03:58.472 --> 04:00.272
(Clears throat)

04:00.274 --> 04:03.008
¶ Oh, yeah

04:03.010 --> 04:04.876
¶ yeah

04:04.878 --> 04:06.878
¶ wow

04:06.880 --> 04:09.781
we heard a noise.
Everything okay?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.516
Liv and Maddie
are best friends,

04:11.518 --> 04:13.852
but being a twin
can get intense.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.754
In sixth grade,
there was an incident

04:15.756 --> 04:17.356
with a curling iron.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.459
In my defense, who sneaks up
behind someone

04:20.461 --> 04:23.095
and tries to curl their hair?

04:23.097 --> 04:26.999
I have a huge scar.
It's right here.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.500
Okay, well, it's here somewhere.
I'm gonna find it.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.869
It's horrible.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.804
I am so glad you're home.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.274
There is something I have been
dying to talk to you about.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.376
(Gasps) This is about a boy!

04:37.378 --> 04:39.177
How do you know that?
When you get nervous,

04:39.179 --> 04:41.179
you still play with that charm
bracelet that I gave you.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.082
Anyway, back to the boy.
Is he cute?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.851
Are you nosey and sparkly?

04:45.853 --> 04:48.453
(Shrieks) Then he is cute!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.555
Okay... spill.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.158
Okay, well, his name
is diggie...
Mm-hmm.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.495
And he's the captain of
the basketball team.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.297
And you know that
competitive thing I get

04:58.299 --> 05:00.065
where I grind my opponents
into submission?

05:01.501 --> 05:03.568
He has it, too.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.804
Wow! Blush much?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.140
Someone has a serious case
of the <i>diggies!</i>

05:08.142 --> 05:10.876
I do.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.879
This is so great
to talk about. Ha ha!

05:13.881 --> 05:15.814
I'm actually kinda hoping
he asks me

05:15.816 --> 05:17.416
to the dance this weekend.
And he hasn't exactly...

05:17.418 --> 05:19.518
oh! Speaking of dance.
(Laughs)

05:19.520 --> 05:21.119
I have the series finale of

05:21.121 --> 05:22.988

06:36.563 --> 06:38.597
something really important
to me.

Liv, you're the first person
I've even mentioned diggie to.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.970
Well, Maddie, you're the first
person I've shown this to.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.572
Except for everybody
on the plane.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.008
They all thought it was
amazing. (Giggles)

06:50.010 --> 06:52.344
You know what I think
is amazing?

06:52.346 --> 06:54.813

gonna talk about me for once.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.418
Oh... we...

07:01.421 --> 07:04.556
We weren't... we weren't
listening.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.658
Neither was she.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.996
(Sighs) Oh, you know what?

07:10.998 --> 07:13.498
I'm just gonna hold on
to this curling iron

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500

07:21.708 --> 07:23.275
Do mom and dad know
you're awake?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.544
I doubt it. They're too focused
on Liv and Maddie

07:25.546 --> 07:27.412
to notice anything we're doing.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.414
I spent all afternoon
on the roof

07:29.416 --> 07:31.049
with a homemade catapult

07:31.051 --> 07:34.119
blasting joggers with
buckets of mashed potatoes.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.522
Ha! You know what?
You're right.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.291
They didn't say a word

07:39.293 --> 07:41.593
when I made beans
and didn't clean the pot.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.230
Okay, yeah, the two of us
are using our freedom

07:45.232 --> 07:49.534
Okay, wait. If we can
get away with anything...
<i>(Game beeps)</i>

07:49.536 --> 07:53.572
We should team up
for something... big.

07:53.574 --> 07:58.643
You mean take the car
and drive to Vegas?!

07:58.645 --> 08:01.279
Okay, smaller.

08:01.281 --> 08:05.584
Let's put this TV in our room.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.687
But mom and dad said that
we can't have a TV in our room.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.590
Mom and dad who?

08:11.592 --> 08:15.393
What if our room wasn't...
Our room?

08:15.395 --> 08:18.530
What if it was our...
Bro cave?

Ah! Bro cave! I love it!

08:20.701 --> 08:23.235
What's a bro cave?

08:23.237 --> 08:26.471
Forget this crummy garage.
In our bro cave,

08:26.473 --> 08:28.240
we would have everything
we want,

08:28.242 --> 08:30.108
and we'd never have to leave
our room.

08:30.110 --> 08:35.080
Uh, TV, food, a hot tub
with a high dive.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.649
That invisible zebra
you're always talking to.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.652

and we're outnumbered,

09:13.654 --> 09:15.253

than they are.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.421
Mm, oh, yeah.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.557
Unlike the Johnsons next door.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.259
I'm pretty sure it was their
jerk kid Ernie

of mashed potatoes earlier.

she was living in Hollywood.

the shame of them walking

09:55.295 --> 09:58.663
are two completely
different things.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.565
Think we've embarrassed
them enough?

10:00.567 --> 10:02.567
Not quite.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.804
(Retches)

10:05.806 --> 10:08.139
(Giggling)

10:09.675 --> 10:11.409
Hi. Maddie.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.345
I'm sorry about last night.

10:13.347 --> 10:16.281
I really wasn't trying to get
you all grumpelstiltskin.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.683
That's okay. You were just
excited to show me your video.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.119
Well, I'm glad we're okay.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.555
Did you want to see it
again?
No.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.523
(Laughs)

10:25.525 --> 10:26.858
What's up, Rooney?

10:31.263 --> 10:32.797
'Sup, diggie?

10:34.233 --> 10:36.568
Oh. So this is diggie.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.804
(Deep voice) Live and in person
for your viewing pleasure!

10:40.806 --> 10:42.540
(Normal voice)
Oh, I... (Chuckles)

10:42.542 --> 10:44.342
I want to be a sports
announcer after I play pro ball,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.844
so I'm just practicing.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.747
(Deep voice) <i>With authority.</i>
<i>(Laughs)</i>

10:48.749 --> 10:50.749
Fun. How would you
introduce me?

10:50.751 --> 10:54.152
If you're seeing double,
do not adjust your screens.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.155
It's the incomparable,
the unstoppable,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.558
if she were popcorn,
she'd poppable...

11:00.560 --> 11:04.729
Liv Rooney!

11:04.731 --> 11:06.898
Um, approved.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.901
(Normal voice)
So, Rooney classic,

11:09.903 --> 11:11.936
what are you doing later?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.905
Um...

11:13.907 --> 11:15.273
(Clicks tongue)

11:15.275 --> 11:16.541
Stuff.

11:17.743 --> 11:20.645
Okay. Ha. Got it.
Well...

11:20.647 --> 11:22.881
Peace out, rooneys.

11:26.652 --> 11:30.855
"'Sup"? "Stuff"?
That's how you flirt?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.725
Liv, flirting's a game, okay?

11:33.727 --> 11:36.194
If diggie knows I like him,
I lose the advantage.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.596
And if I lose the advantage,
I lose.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.331
And I don't lose!
Bam! What?!

11:40.333 --> 11:43.201
Okay, stop with all the sports
nonsense and listen to me.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.969
If you want diggie to ask you
to that dance,

11:44.971 --> 11:49.808
No. I do not need your help
getting diggie, okay?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.543
Do you hear me?

11:51.545 --> 11:54.512
Do not help.

11:54.514 --> 11:58.683
Seriously, have you ever heard
such a clear cry for help?

11:58.685 --> 12:02.787
<i>And the easiest way for me</i>
<i>to help Maddie...</i>

12:02.789 --> 12:05.256
<i>Was to become Maddie.</i>

12:09.929 --> 12:11.596
Whoa!

12:15.801 --> 12:18.369
(Thud)

12:18.371 --> 12:20.605
'Sup, Joey?

12:20.607 --> 12:22.874
It's me... <i>Maddie.</i>

12:24.744 --> 12:27.912
It's not really Maddie.
It's Liv! (Shrieks)

12:27.914 --> 12:29.848
Liv, what are you doing?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.649
Maddie and I got off
on the wrong foot,

12:31.651 --> 12:33.418
so I'm gonna fix it
in the way that only

12:33.420 --> 12:34.919
an actress like me can...

12:34.921 --> 12:37.455
I'm gonna land her
a date to the dance.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.591
I wish I had a twin
that would help me

12:39.593 --> 12:42.594
land a date to the dance.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.796
I would call him Michael.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.566
'Sup, diggie?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.602
'Sup, Rooney?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.971
Stuff.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.606
So, what do you say?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.641
You, me, dance, this weekend?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.810
Bam! What?!

13:00.513 --> 13:04.616
Oh, wow, this is
kind of awkward. Um...

13:04.618 --> 13:06.785
I just don't feel
that way about you.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.488
So... sorry.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.461
Michael would have nailed that.

13:21.634 --> 13:26.738
Hey! There is some major
twin drama about to go down,

13:26.740 --> 13:29.774
and it is the perfect
opportunity

13:29.776 --> 13:33.645
to complete... the bro cave!

13:33.647 --> 13:36.514
Think big. Shock me!

13:36.516 --> 13:39.317
Maybe we should...

13:39.319 --> 13:40.585
Take a car and drive to Vegas!

13:40.587 --> 13:43.721
We are not driving to Vegas!

13:43.723 --> 13:45.957
Fine!

13:47.426 --> 13:49.894
Well, I do get a little thirsty

13:49.896 --> 13:51.729
eating all that popcorn.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.800
Now that little rat brain
of yours is clicking.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.806
The bro cave was complete...

14:01.808 --> 14:03.541
But it's a little trickier

14:03.543 --> 14:05.109
dragging a 200-pound fridge
up the stairs

14:05.111 --> 14:06.611
than you might think.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.446
Here's a tip.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.983
Take the milk out of the fridge
before you start moving it.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.853
And the eggs.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.856
Hey, fellas, I need
to talk to you.

14:17.858 --> 14:18.957
(Door closes)

14:18.959 --> 14:21.759
It has been an honor, soldier.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.031
You guys holding up okay?

14:29.068 --> 14:30.902
I know your mother and I
have been

14:30.904 --> 14:34.505
a <i>little </i> distracted
with Liv and Maddie.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.042
Everything all right?

14:38.044 --> 14:41.779
Yeah. You take care
of those two troublemakers.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.082
Don't give us another thought.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.950
All right.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.153
You're the best. (Laughs)

14:49.155 --> 14:51.890
Now let go of my hand,
you munch.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.731
Mom! I seriously
need to talk to you

14:59.733 --> 15:01.099
about a major family situation.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.668
(Gasps) I have been
waiting for this! (Stammers)

15:03.670 --> 15:06.804
Family meeting!
Family meeting!

15:06.806 --> 15:09.674
I created family meetings

15:09.676 --> 15:13.011
to give everyone a forum
to share their feelings.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.480
Which gets crazy boring.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.515
So I added a shot clock.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.717
Ten seconds to say
what needs to be said,

15:19.719 --> 15:20.952
then...
(Blows air horn)

15:20.954 --> 15:22.654
Ooh!

15:22.656 --> 15:24.789
Liv has something
she wants to talk about.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.724
So go ahead, honey.
We're listening.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.163
Um... (Chuckles nervously)

15:32.165 --> 15:33.798
You know, I was really
just gonna have

15:33.800 --> 15:37.101
a private chat with mom,
but seeing as we're all here,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.737
let me just say...

15:39.739 --> 15:43.141
It is snaptastic to be
home with the fam.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.176
Missed you guys so much.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.012
So very, very, very,
very, very...

15:48.014 --> 15:50.982
(Blows air horn)

15:50.984 --> 15:53.685
Much. (Laughs)

15:53.687 --> 15:55.219
Wait, honey, that's what
you wanted to talk about?

15:55.221 --> 15:57.655
Well, it's sweet and all,
but it is a gross misuse

15:57.657 --> 15:59.857
of the family meeting.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.694
Yeah. No, I know. I thought
you were gonna tell Maddie...

16:02.696 --> 16:04.162
(Blows air horn)

16:04.164 --> 16:07.165
That you talked to diggie...
(Blows horn)

16:07.167 --> 16:10.635
About the dance...
(Blows horn)

16:11.837 --> 16:13.705
Liv, what is he talking about?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.239
Maddie, I...

16:15.241 --> 16:16.975
Pretend to be you and I asked
diggie to the dance

16:16.977 --> 16:18.810
and he said he doesn't
like you in that way.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.812
(Laughs) Feels so good
to get it off my chest.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.548
Who's next?
You did <i>what?</i>

16:23.550 --> 16:25.750
It's all right, Maddie.
Everyone will get their turn.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.553
Yeah, and I'm up.
What I want to know

16:28.555 --> 16:31.889
is why I can't poop
with the door open?

16:33.125 --> 16:35.793
Everyone in the house
had changed my diaper!

16:35.795 --> 16:37.729
What are we running from,
people?

16:39.598 --> 16:41.199
You pretended to be me?!

16:41.201 --> 16:43.701
Maddie, I promise I was
just trying to help you.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.603
No, Liv, you were not trying
to help me.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.938
I told you to leave diggie
alone.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.040
But the great Liv Rooney
just had to step in

16:49.042 --> 16:50.808
and try and fix my life!

16:50.810 --> 16:52.210
Well, guess what?

16:52.212 --> 16:54.078
My life doesn't need fixing!

16:54.080 --> 16:56.614
Ooh, it was so much easier
being your sister

16:56.616 --> 16:59.550
when you were 2,000 Miles away.
I wish you never came home!

16:59.552 --> 17:01.019
Maddie!
Fine, I'll go back!

17:01.021 --> 17:02.720
Liv!
Good! Go!

17:02.722 --> 17:04.722
Ugh!
Ugh!

17:08.160 --> 17:12.730
Liv moving back to Hollywood
meant all eyes back on us.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.900
And that means we'd have
to dismantle the bro cave.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.068
(Sniffles)

17:17.070 --> 17:18.903
I'm gonna miss it!

17:19.972 --> 17:21.806
Liv, honey,
I'm coming upstairs.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.641
We need to talk.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.783
Everything okay, Joey?

17:31.785 --> 17:34.052
(Raspy voice)
Never better, baby.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.058
Honey... it's mom.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.727
(Door closes)

17:44.897 --> 17:47.265
Mom, you're not
changing my mind.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.033
Are you sure

17:49.035 --> 17:52.236
that moving back to Hollywood
is the best idea?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.738
(Sighs)

17:53.740 --> 17:55.039
I lived with Aunt Dina
for four years,

17:55.041 --> 17:56.274
and it was better for everyone.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.142
Honey, I understand that.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.211
But let's... let's dialogue
it out,

18:00.213 --> 18:02.213
and we'll all make
a decision together.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.116
Oh, we weren't gonna make
this decision together.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.051
She's 15.
We're her parents.

18:07.053 --> 18:10.822
She wasn't going anywhere,
but I wanted her

18:10.824 --> 18:12.290
to feel heard.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.092
If she tried to leave
this house,

18:14.094 --> 18:17.795
I was literally going
to sit on her.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.034
Ooh!

18:23.036 --> 18:25.636
This girl is <i>en fuego!</i>

18:25.638 --> 18:28.306
Hey.
Hey.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.974
I need to talk to you.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.810
I want you to know
why I said no about the dance.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.078
Well...

18:34.080 --> 18:36.314
This couldn't get
any more awkward.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.815
Out of our way!

18:37.817 --> 18:40.985
We have got a bro cave
to dismantle!

18:42.154 --> 18:44.822
What do you know?
Got more awkward.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.990
(Clears throat)

18:45.992 --> 18:48.960
I said no because
I knew it was Liv.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.962
What?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.830
Yeah. She, um,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.298
didn't do that cute
thing you do

18:54.300 --> 18:57.034
with your charm bracelet
when you're nervous.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.338
(Laughs and snorts)
Oh... (Chuckles)

19:00.340 --> 19:02.940
I'm an athlete.
I don't get nervous.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.143
Mm-hmm. I know you,
Maddie.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.044
Your sister has the same
face, but...

19:07.046 --> 19:09.380
I know you.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.782
Eep!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.351
So...

19:13.353 --> 19:15.987
Rooney...

19:15.989 --> 19:17.955
You want to go to that dance?

19:17.957 --> 19:20.424
Yes. (Laughs)

19:21.793 --> 19:23.261
Just to be clear, though...

19:23.263 --> 19:24.929
Hmm.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.198
I won this, right?

19:29.968 --> 19:31.769
No.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.106
I win because I get to
take you to the dance.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.808
Oh... (Chuckles)

19:37.810 --> 19:41.212
That's what losers say!
Bam! What?!

19:43.415 --> 19:44.982
Liv, if you're leaving,

19:44.984 --> 19:47.818
you should probably
take this with you.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.388
Wow.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.323
Remember when
you two made that?

19:52.325 --> 19:56.227
"Sisters by chance,
friends by choice"?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.196
It's so corny.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.866
Liv, honey, twins are special.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.102
Since the day you were born,
it's never been just Liv

20:05.104 --> 20:07.071
and it's never been
just Maddie.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.708
It's always been
"Liv and Maddie."

20:10.710 --> 20:12.109
You'll always be
sisters, honey.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.111
But it's hard to be
best friends

20:14.113 --> 20:16.047
if you're 2,000 Miles away.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.917
(Voice breaking)
What, you think I'm just gonna

20:19.919 --> 20:22.019
fall to pieces over
a second grade art project?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.421
(Sobs)

20:25.090 --> 20:27.792
(Sighs) Maddie...

20:27.794 --> 20:29.093
All right, come on, Parker.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.096
We have got a fridge
to move. Go! Go! Go!

20:32.098 --> 20:35.032
You know, in a weird way,
we kinda have

20:35.034 --> 20:36.734
Liv to thank for this.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.904
Yeah, you're right.
Hmm.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.305
Liv.

20:41.307 --> 20:45.009
Um, I have to stop her.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.177
By the way...

20:46.179 --> 20:48.145
I'm not wearing a dress
to that dance.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.083
Where's Liv?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.884
She just left.
No!

20:53.886 --> 20:55.753
She went out back
to look for you.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.956
Could have been a little clearer
when I asked you the first time.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.092
Where's Maddie?

21:01.094 --> 21:03.194
Uh, inside.
(Shrieks)

21:08.800 --> 21:10.534
Maddie!
Liv!

21:10.536 --> 21:12.136
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to <i>you.</i>

21:12.138 --> 21:14.138
(Panting)
Okay, yeah. You first.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.539
I have to catch my breath.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.076
I don't usually do
my own stunts.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.511
Liv, what I said was mean.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.147
I'm totally psyched
you came home from Hollywood.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.015
I'm sorry.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.783
No, you were right.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.085
I shouldn't have tried
to fix your life. I'm sorry.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.054
Diggie asked me to the dance.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.123
(Both shriek)

21:32.125 --> 21:35.426
Get this. He only said no
because he knew it was you.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.895
Knew it was me? (Laughs)

21:37.897 --> 21:39.163
Please, no.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.799
I do Maddie better
than Maddie does, okay?

21:41.801 --> 21:43.534
Bam! <i>Who?!</i>

21:45.003 --> 21:48.005
Wait. Is it "bam! What?"

21:48.007 --> 21:51.075
(Voice breaking) Oh, no way!

21:51.077 --> 21:53.344
I remember when we made this.

21:53.346 --> 21:57.315
"Sisters by chance,
friends by choice."

21:57.317 --> 21:58.983
So corny. (Laughs)

21:58.985 --> 22:01.319
So corny. (Laughs)

22:02.587 --> 22:05.056
Liv, please don't leave.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.058
(Cries) You couldn't
drag me away.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.294
(Both crying)

22:10.296 --> 22:12.063
Oh, I am gonna lose it.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.898
Hold it together.
Hold it together.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.966
(Crash, shattering)

22:27.412 --> 22:29.013
Vegas?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.114
Vegas!

22:33.051 --> 22:34.318
(Door slams)

22:34.320 --> 22:38.055
(Both laughing)

22:43.028 --> 22:45.162
Parker, if you're not
gonna close the door,

22:45.164 --> 22:47.298
at least don't make
eye contact!

22:47.300 --> 22:50.234
It's only weird
if you make it weird!

22:51.870 --> 22:53.204
(Doorbell rings) Ooh, ooh!

22:53.206 --> 22:54.572
(Sighs)

22:57.042 --> 22:59.510
(Deep voice) You starting lineup
for tonight's dance...

22:59.512 --> 23:03.047
diggie and Maddie!

23:05.951 --> 23:08.018
That's cute.
(Normal voice)
Good evening...

23:08.020 --> 23:09.553
have her home by 11:00.
Okay.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.955
(Footsteps)

23:17.229 --> 23:18.529
Whoa!

23:18.531 --> 23:21.165
I-I think I swallowed
my gum.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.434
Am I a miracle worker?
A little bit.

23:23.436 --> 23:27.071
Photo time, so come...
come on down.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.241
Um...

23:30.243 --> 23:32.276
I can't do this.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.448
You heard the girl.
She changed her mind. Beat it.

23:38.517 --> 23:41.051
Oh.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.188
That's better.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.124
Um, Maddie, this is a dance.
You can't...

23:47.126 --> 23:50.161
uh! I put a dress on.
Do not push it.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.030
Wait. Photo time.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.199
Say "dazzleberry."

23:55.201 --> 23:57.601
(Both) Dazzleberry!
