01:02.421 --> 01:04.419
Oh my God,
the pep rally.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.058
Yeah,
so I was like "no".

01:50.060 --> 01:51.138
And she was like, "yeah".

01:51.140 --> 01:53.018
And I was like, "uhm, no".

01:53.020 --> 01:55.938
And then she said, "ya", so I
said, "no" and then she like

01:55.940 --> 01:58.538
looked at my phone.
Tot's give me that look.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.019
And she was like, "Yeah".

02:00.021 --> 02:01.698
So guess what I said then?

02:01.700 --> 02:04.378
- No?
- Yeah.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.459
Anyway, if I see her on
Saturday I'm like totally

02:06.461 --> 02:08.898
telling her, "no".
Are you gonna come?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.018
To what?

02:10.020 --> 02:12.939
Uhm, Kelsey's
super secret party?

02:12.941 --> 02:14.298
Total rager.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.259
Bonfire, on her granddad's farm
and like he's mostly deaf.

02:17.261 --> 02:18.899
So he's like not going
to know that we're there.

02:18.901 --> 02:20.778
You don't think that he's
going to notice a giant

02:20.780 --> 02:21.739
bonfire in his field?

02:21.741 --> 02:23.259
Ahh. #buzzkill.

02:23.261 --> 02:25.778
I can't anyway.

02:25.780 --> 02:29.019
I have a date with
The Mayor of Casterbridge.

02:29.021 --> 02:31.618
OMG-ew.
What is he like, 40?

02:31.620 --> 02:33.259
It's a book.

02:33.261 --> 02:35.299
By Thomas Hardy.

02:35.301 --> 02:38.619
OK. Uhm, can you read your Hardy
Boys book like another night?

02:38.621 --> 02:41.139
Because I'm super worried about
you, like you're at risk of

02:41.141 --> 02:43.418
completely screwing
up your social life.

02:43.420 --> 02:46.501
Like can you start hanging
out with actual people, more?

02:57.581 --> 02:58.819
Yeah.

02:58.821 --> 03:00.298
Maybe you're right.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.219
Unbelievable.
She just texted me again.

03:03.221 --> 03:04.701
"NO".

03:05.140 --> 03:07.379
All caps.

03:07.381 --> 03:09.419
Christian,
long time no see, man.

03:09.421 --> 03:10.898
Welcome to Bergerac High.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.179
- Good to see you Lee.
- How's the old neighborhood?

03:13.181 --> 03:15.538
Good. Same old.
I miss it already.

03:15.540 --> 03:16.538
It's not so bad here.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.779
I mean the jocks insufferable,
but apart from that.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.939
You know I already tried out
for the football team, right?

03:20.941 --> 03:22.858
Did I say all jocks?

03:22.860 --> 03:24.378
I meant some jocks.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.779
If you hate jocks much why
are you at a pep rally.

03:26.781 --> 03:28.098
Covering it for
the school news site.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.939
That and Cyrus says
something's going down,

03:29.941 --> 03:31.499
so I would not miss
that for the world.

03:31.501 --> 03:33.259
- Who?
- Cyrus Nollen.

03:33.261 --> 03:34.858
Computer genius.
Notorious hacker.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.301
You can't miss him.
He's got a giant...

03:38.940 --> 03:40.058
Nose?

03:40.060 --> 03:41.779
Don't say that.
He might be listening.

03:41.781 --> 03:43.379
Seriously, nobody says a word...

03:43.381 --> 03:46.338
Don't... It's like saying
Voldemort at Hogwarts,

03:46.340 --> 03:47.341
it just isn't done.

03:50.181 --> 03:52.858
One time Cyrus wiped a kids'
entire tablet because he was

03:52.860 --> 03:54.458
scratching his nose too
much and he thought he

03:54.460 --> 03:56.019
might be making fun of him.

03:56.021 --> 03:57.779
- Harsh.
- That's nothing.

03:57.781 --> 04:00.418
One time coach Harris called
him Schnauz in gym class.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.939
Next week the tax bureau
audited him. Seized his car.

04:02.941 --> 04:04.341
You don't even think the word...

04:06.460 --> 04:08.099
Come on, how big can it be?
You gotta pic?

04:08.101 --> 04:09.258
No. No one does.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.460
He refuses to let anyone
photograph him, ever.

04:15.141 --> 04:17.139
No one's seen a clear picture
of him. He's like Bigfoot.

04:17.141 --> 04:18.058
More like big nose.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.939
I said don't see that.

04:19.940 --> 04:26.698
Excuse me, AV club
coming through. Heavy machinery.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.539
What's that?

04:43.541 --> 04:45.258
A personal project.

04:45.260 --> 04:46.660
Just keep looking over there.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.219
Ohh!

04:51.740 --> 04:52.858
Whiner.

05:13.221 --> 05:16.098
Bronwyn. Quit fooling around.
We're running out of time.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.299
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

05:17.301 --> 05:19.059
Where have you,
where have you been?

05:19.061 --> 05:28.898
Stayed up late prepping.
Almost done.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.378
That's her.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.299
Dude, that's the girl I was
texting you about. Who is she?

05:33.301 --> 05:35.659
That is Roxy Rostand.

05:35.661 --> 05:38.258
The good news is you have
excellent taste. The bad

05:38.260 --> 05:42.539
news is, unless you're a dead
author, she's not interested.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.139
Man, she's killing me.

05:44.141 --> 05:45.898
Her locker is right
outside of my art class.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.579
I tried to talk to her twice.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.261
I got nothing.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.500
I'll contact you from
the tech room, Bronwyn.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.698
Right.
Just a second, Bronwyn.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.820
I'm just going to check
the security camera view.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.780
Alright, I pulled the files.
I'm all set here.

06:30.060 --> 06:34.178
Done.
Try the remote test.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.738
Alright. Attention all planets
to the solar federation.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.138
We have assumed control.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.899
I don't know why you
need this station too.

06:39.901 --> 06:42.138
I'm perfectly capable
of handling this end.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.658
Two words, Bronwyn.
Plausible deniability.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.059
Can't get my favorite
cousin in trouble.

06:46.061 --> 06:48.899
Right. I might get kicked
out of the AV club.

06:48.901 --> 06:49.941
Devastating.

06:50.781 --> 06:52.699
I'm getting the start signal.
Standby.

06:52.701 --> 06:56.298
Go LX on my mark.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.138
Okay. Okay,
I think, I think we're ready

06:59.140 --> 07:01.778
to start now.
Can we settle in please?

07:01.780 --> 07:04.258
People. People let's go!

07:04.260 --> 07:07.661
People, move, let's go.
Can we settle in.

07:09.980 --> 07:12.699
Hey!

07:12.701 --> 07:15.379
Calm down!

07:15.381 --> 07:17.338
Thank you Principal Castillo.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.818
Bergerac High. Are you
ready to raise the roof!

07:24.700 --> 07:27.178
Can we have a little
more enthusiasm!

07:33.140 --> 07:37.338
We are going
to destroy Springfield High

07:37.340 --> 07:39.258
on Friday.
Am I right?

07:40.901 --> 07:46.139
Now it's time to introduce
to you, your Bergerac Bears!

07:46.141 --> 07:49.699
Your starting
quarterback, Steve Guishe.

07:51.061 --> 07:52.978
Steve I love you!

07:52.980 --> 07:54.298
Yeah,
that's right, that's right.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.339
Let's talk about your
running back for a second.

07:56.341 --> 07:58.099
His name is Trevor Conroy.

08:00.701 --> 08:03.818
And defensive
tackle, Mike Fluery.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.699
I thought
I told you not to come here.

08:19.501 --> 08:20.739
Look, I know you're
failing English,

08:20.741 --> 08:22.579
so I'll put it in simpler terms

08:22.581 --> 08:24.498
that you understand.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.460
Get off the stage.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.778
Ohhhhh!!

08:30.780 --> 08:33.419
Nolan, You stop
this right now, you little...

08:33.421 --> 08:35.738
If you don't stop this...

08:37.140 --> 08:38.979
The school charter says you
can't play football unless you

08:38.981 --> 08:40.058
pass English and yet-

08:40.059 --> 08:42.658
there you are. Care to explain?

08:42.659 --> 08:43.818
Bite me, Nolan.

08:43.821 --> 08:46.019
You know,
getting a tutor was a good idea,

08:46.021 --> 08:48.259
but when that tutor gives
you her number, maybe don't send

08:48.261 --> 08:49.819
her a picture of your junk.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.979
Maybe this will help.
I've wrote a poem.

09:12.981 --> 09:14.699
The rhyming word kind.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.419
And there you stand.
You look amazed.

09:17.421 --> 09:20.218
You reek of body spray
and cheese. I hardly think

09:20.220 --> 09:22.739
you'll be in phase when I show
the crowd your knees.

09:22.741 --> 09:25.059
Oohhhhh!!

09:25.061 --> 09:26.939
The panic starts
to grip you, friend.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.139
We can see it in your eyes,
cause when this poem finds

09:29.141 --> 09:32.339
an end, we'll see much more
than just your this thighs.

09:34.260 --> 09:37.178
Be careful, Mike of what you
send. I'm not some kind of Noob.

09:37.180 --> 09:38.658
Cause when this
poem finds and end,

09:38.660 --> 09:40.898
we'll see much more
than just your boob.

09:43.701 --> 09:45.578
I can't believe you piece of
slime, the depths to which

09:45.580 --> 09:47.898
you've sunk, and now we're
almost out of time so let's

09:47.900 --> 09:49.699
all see your junk!

09:53.100 --> 09:55.298
You get off the stage
and quit the football team by

09:55.300 --> 09:56.658
the time I count to three.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.258
You can't tell me
what to do, Bro.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.059
One...

09:59.061 --> 10:00.018
It's none of your business.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.098
Two...

10:01.100 --> 10:02.218
I swear, when I find you...

10:02.220 --> 10:03.458
Three!

10:06.780 --> 10:09.299
And that concludes
today's special announcements.

10:09.301 --> 10:12.338
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled athletics

10:12.340 --> 10:14.380
propaganda indoctrination.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.218
Phew!

10:17.220 --> 10:20.338
Okay. Alright.
Enough, enough. Very funny.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.898
Very funny Bergerac High.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.778
Show us the pic.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.459
- It's all very funny.
- Show us the pic.

10:25.461 --> 10:27.621
Show us the pic.
Show us the pic.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.538
Oh! Hey.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.021
Ahhh, I was looking for the...

10:46.420 --> 10:48.420
paper towels.
Here they are.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.780
Oh, I, I can explain all this.

10:56.381 --> 10:58.061
No, you're right.
I can't.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.979
That's cool.

11:05.981 --> 11:08.179
Still got that thing?
I mean, It's pretty handy.

11:08.181 --> 11:10.539
You never know when a
jungle will suddenly appear

11:10.541 --> 11:12.859
in the suburbs.
It's kind of like Jumanji.

11:12.861 --> 11:15.821
That's actually one of the
earliest films to use CGI and...

11:17.061 --> 11:18.938
It can wait.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.578
Help me out here.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.259
I know you're not stupid.

11:22.261 --> 11:24.378
You must have known you
were going to get caught.

11:24.380 --> 11:28.019
Well I didn't think I was
going to get caught today.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.418
Two months into the
school year and I'm looking at

11:30.420 --> 11:31.980
five separate incidents.

11:33.900 --> 11:34.700
Well, wait.

11:35.740 --> 11:37.298
Mike sent a picture
of his junk to a student,

11:37.300 --> 11:38.698
and I'm the one
who's in trouble?

11:38.700 --> 11:41.498
I'll see him later.
Right now, you are my problem.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.299
Actually I think your
problem is pep rallies.

11:43.301 --> 11:45.259
I mean, who still has those?
You know what,

11:45.261 --> 11:47.381
you weren't finished.
I, I apologize. Go ahead.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.420
I like you, Cyrus.

11:53.220 --> 11:55.619
But you gotta cut the crap.

11:55.621 --> 11:56.899
Get serious.

11:56.901 --> 11:59.819
MIT admissions
looks at this stuff.

11:59.821 --> 12:01.939
You're one of the smartest
kids in this school

12:01.941 --> 12:06.418
and you're throwing it
all away on stupid pranks!

12:06.420 --> 12:08.579
Two weeks detention
in the computer lab.

12:08.581 --> 12:11.218
I'm not going to suspend you,
because you need all the time

12:11.220 --> 12:13.979
you can get to bring
your grades around.

12:13.981 --> 12:15.939
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

12:15.941 --> 12:18.860
Now you keep your no...
ahh, self clean.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.941
Cyrus.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.661
Hope she's worth it.

12:29.141 --> 12:30.739
Totally.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.099
Thought we'd try a little
amateur photography, huh Mister?

12:39.101 --> 12:40.821
In my office.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.620
Hey, hmmm.

12:50.181 --> 12:51.498
Hey Nolan.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.378
You just cost me my
defensive tackle.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.499
Well, maybe he should have
been a little more defensive

12:55.501 --> 12:57.018
about showing his tackle.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.339
Ha, ha.

12:58.341 --> 13:01.779
Maybe next time you should
keep your nose

13:01.781 --> 13:03.419
out of other people's business.

13:03.421 --> 13:05.298
What was that?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.819
You heard me. My dad created
half the software you steal.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.779
So I don't sweat you and
your little hacker crap.

13:10.781 --> 13:16.418
So next time, keep your
big fat nose

13:16.420 --> 13:18.140
out of my business.

13:19.621 --> 13:23.658
Is that it?

13:23.660 --> 13:25.421
Yeah. That's it.

13:26.860 --> 13:30.019
You had a great opportunity
to say some cool one.

13:30.021 --> 13:33.821
Walk away like a bad ass and
all you got is big fat nose.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.978
You got a problem with that?

13:36.980 --> 13:39.899
Put a little effort in.

13:39.901 --> 13:42.459
Something
like, yeah, animation.

13:42.461 --> 13:45.378
If you don't lying Pinocchio,
you'll never become a real boy.

13:46.381 --> 13:49.138
Or psychology.
Something Freudian.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.618
Hey, sometimes a
nose is just a nose.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.299
Yeah. Hilarious.

13:53.301 --> 13:55.619
Anatomy. Something gross.

13:55.621 --> 13:57.499
Not really nose
picking with you.

13:57.501 --> 13:59.378
It's more like spelunking.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.819
Comedy.

14:00.821 --> 14:03.261
Is that a nose on your face or
are you just happy to see me.

14:04.141 --> 14:05.658
Gardening.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.538
You can have a part
time job as a sundial.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.019
Parenting.

14:10.021 --> 14:13.379
Hey, when you're dad got your
nose did he need two hands?

14:13.381 --> 14:14.381
Movie quotes.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.140
We're gonna need
a bigger Kleenex.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.940
That's no nose,
that's a space station.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.618
With a great nose comes
great responsibility.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.820
But of course, you'd never
think of anything like that.

14:30.501 --> 14:35.218
It's been said that integrity
is to be preferred to eloquence.

14:35.220 --> 14:38.499
And you Steve,
seem to be short on both.

14:38.501 --> 14:41.819
I understand, it's gotta be
hard to get oxygen to your brain

14:41.821 --> 14:44.218
when your head is so
far up your daddy's ass.

14:45.421 --> 14:47.421
Oops! Is that the time?
We gotta go, Cyrus.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.941
You've been served.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.219
So what's the bad news?

14:57.221 --> 14:59.579
Two weeks detention
in the computer lab.

14:59.581 --> 15:00.899
That's not so bad.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.499
Yeah.
Except it was my last chance.

15:03.501 --> 15:06.019
So I'll have to be more
careful when I get Steve back.

15:06.021 --> 15:07.898
Or you could let it go.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.618
You can't let him get
away with it, Bronwyn.

15:09.620 --> 15:10.618
They'll walk all over you.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.578
You need to chill
about the nose thing.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.538
- No one cares but you, dude.
- Girls care.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.939
No, we don't. We like a big
nose, we make assumptions.

15:17.941 --> 15:20.261
- Assumptions?
- Assumptions.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.459
Anyway this isn't about girls.

15:23.461 --> 15:24.658
It's about a girl.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.258
Oh, god.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.338
We're just friends.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.139
If you don't tell Roxy,
it'll never be anything

15:29.141 --> 15:30.379
more than just friends.

15:30.381 --> 15:33.178
Tell her?
Have you seen this thing.

15:33.180 --> 15:35.539
Gets into a room ten minutes
before the rest of me does.

15:35.541 --> 15:36.899
What's the worst
thing that can happen.

15:36.901 --> 15:39.058
She'll laugh at me.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.499
And?

15:40.501 --> 15:42.621
And that's literally the
worst thing that could happen.

15:44.301 --> 15:47.259
Look I can handle taunting
from idiots like Steve.

15:47.261 --> 15:51.778
But, if I saw awkwardness or
revulsion or pity when she

15:51.780 --> 15:54.259
looked at me, that
I couldn't handle.

15:54.261 --> 15:56.779
You just ate two weeks
detention to get back at

15:56.781 --> 15:58.778
a creep who sent her a dick pic.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.738
And you did it while
reciting a poem.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.818
I'm pretty sure she's
going to be receptive.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.219
Yeah sure okay but...

16:05.221 --> 16:07.018
She looked pretty
impressed when I saw her.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.178
Really?

16:08.180 --> 16:10.179
Yup. But hey, what do I know.

16:10.181 --> 16:12.098
If you want to live the rest
of your life like you're in an

16:12.100 --> 16:13.778
Adele song, that's
your business.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.459
Hello.

16:20.461 --> 16:22.098
You are certifiable.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.819
Who is this please?

16:23.821 --> 16:25.618
You know very
well who this is, Sir.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.299
I can't believe you did that.

16:28.301 --> 16:29.739
I can't believe you
agree to tutor that guy.

16:29.741 --> 16:31.699
Yeah, well...

16:31.701 --> 16:33.698
He needed help.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.018
You have to give people a chance
no matter who they are, right?

16:36.020 --> 16:38.019
Oh well.
I'll try to remember that.

16:38.021 --> 16:41.899
Anyway, that was amazing.
Thank you so much.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.658
I hope you didn't get
into too much trouble.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.379
No. Nothing I can't handle.

16:45.381 --> 16:46.940
Good. I'm glad.

16:47.861 --> 16:50.258
There's something
I want to tell you.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.138
Okay.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.378
Yeah, it's not really
an over-the-phone thing.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.179
Coffee, tomorrow
morning at Rags?

16:57.181 --> 16:59.299
7:30. My treat.

16:59.301 --> 17:02.899
Ahh, 7:30 ahh yeah.
It's a date.

17:02.901 --> 17:05.979
I mean, it's a date
that's acceptable, to me.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.178
It works.
A date that works for me.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.778
I'm free tomorrow.
Sounds good.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.818
Okay, bye Cy.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.619
Okay, ha, ha. Bye.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.459
Well?

17:17.461 --> 17:19.339
Coffee tomorrow
morning at Rags.

17:19.340 --> 17:21.098
Cool. I'm working tomorrow.
Save you a table.

17:21.101 --> 17:23.938
This isn't like our usual thing.
This is big.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.258
She has something to
tell me, in person.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.659
Because it's not an
over-the-phone thing.

17:27.661 --> 17:29.258
Probably medical test results.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.578
Okay. Joke if you must,
but this could be it.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.898
This could actually be it!
Whoo!

17:37.740 --> 17:38.901
Sorry.

17:43.541 --> 17:46.219
Ohh. Excuse me,
ahh, beautiful stranger.

17:46.221 --> 17:47.219
Have you seen my mother?

17:47.221 --> 17:49.659
Ehm, Would you like
to discuss the phone call

17:49.661 --> 17:52.578
I got today?

17:52.580 --> 17:53.498
You look great.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.819
Yeah, don't try
and butter me up.

17:55.821 --> 17:57.619
You're just lucky I'm
running late for a date,

17:57.621 --> 17:59.540
but we will discuss it.
Now, I need a zip.

18:00.781 --> 18:03.458
Honestly, I don't know
what possesses you.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.219
Why would you
disrupt a pep rally?

18:05.221 --> 18:06.379
It's kind of a long story.

18:06.381 --> 18:08.538
It always is.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.939
Okay.

18:09.941 --> 18:11.858
Here's $20 to order pizza.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.539
Please order one this time.
You look like I don't feed you.

18:14.541 --> 18:15.859
I know. It's the nose.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.299
It naturally makes the
rest of me look smaller.

18:17.301 --> 18:19.979
It's a very handsome nose.
Your grandfather...

18:19.981 --> 18:22.501
Had the same one and I wish
he would have kept it.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.499
I'll be back around 11:30.
Try not to hack into

18:26.501 --> 18:28.619
the Pentagon or
anything while I'm out.

18:28.621 --> 18:29.579
No promises.

18:29.581 --> 18:31.339
I love you.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.218
I love you too.
Say hi to Dave for me.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.739
I will. Oh and he says thank
you for fixing his phone.

18:35.741 --> 18:36.538
No problem.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.379
Bye Sweetie.

18:37.381 --> 18:38.538
Bye Mom.

19:01.821 --> 19:03.898
There he is.
The big day.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.979
Looking sharp.
How are you feeling?

19:05.981 --> 19:07.979
Great.
And by great, I mean terrified.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.659
That's okay.
Fear is good.

19:09.661 --> 19:11.698
It keeps you on your toes.
Come on.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.260
I saved you a seat out back.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.218
Go get 'em Tiger.
Grrr.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.578
Oh God.
This is happening.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.378
- Yes it is.
- I feel sick.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.698
Don't you dare wimp out on this.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.139
What is she gonna say?

19:25.141 --> 19:27.859
What what am I gonna say?
Tell me what to say.

19:27.861 --> 19:29.621
Here. Write it down.

19:30.381 --> 19:31.899
Uhm, you have to
tell her I'm sick.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.378
No, uh.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.058
I can make your
life a living hell.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.378
I got up at 5:00 this morning
to serve coffee to hipsters.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.699
See that guy over there.

19:39.701 --> 19:42.939
He's been working on that
screenplay for two years.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.778
He tells me about it everyday.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.499
My life is already hell.

19:47.301 --> 19:48.981
Now write something.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.780
Okay.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.860
Okay, so how do I feel?

19:57.501 --> 19:58.498
Hey Rox!

19:58.500 --> 20:01.659
Hey Bronwyn.
What 'ch doin there?

20:01.661 --> 20:03.539
Science project.

20:03.541 --> 20:04.819
What can I get you?

20:04.821 --> 20:07.978
Ah, Earl Grey tea please
and a vanilla latte for Cyrus.

20:07.980 --> 20:09.579
Is he here yet?

20:09.581 --> 20:12.618
Yeah he's ah-
he's out back.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.898
$9.50 please.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.938
There you go.

20:15.940 --> 20:18.618
By the way, fishing wire
will work better for that.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.861
Fishing wire.
Hmm, brilliant.

20:25.301 --> 20:27.618
Ah oh, looks like didn't
finish his homework last night.

20:27.620 --> 20:30.539
Oh yeah, hah,
just trying to think.

20:30.541 --> 20:32.181
Ahh paper, thing.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.699
Have a seat.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.619
Thanks.

20:35.621 --> 20:36.459
Is that mine?

20:36.461 --> 20:39.018
Ahh, yeah, yeah.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.900
So, what were you working on?

20:42.861 --> 20:44.018
Ahh, top secret.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.779
Oh yeah? Is it blueprints
for my epic blanket

20:46.781 --> 20:48.578
you promised to make
me when we were eight?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.659
I'm real busy, but it's
definitely on my to do list.

20:50.661 --> 20:53.698
With a big bookshelf and lots
of cushions so we can read.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.858
Remember? You promised.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.539
I'll get right on it.

20:57.541 --> 21:01.258
So ah, what, what couldn't
you tell me over the phone.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.740
Well, I like someone.

21:06.061 --> 21:07.458
Yeah.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.338
Someone who I
think likes me too,

21:09.340 --> 21:11.818
but is too shy to say anything.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.338
Oh.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.019
I can tell in his face that he
wants to tell me and he doesn't.

21:16.021 --> 21:19.258
Hey, are you OK?
Your hand's shaking.

21:19.260 --> 21:23.058
Oh ahh, It's just the coffee.
It's fine. Gone.

21:23.060 --> 21:28.658
Umm, well he's super shy
and sweet and amazing.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.418
Roxy, I...

21:30.420 --> 21:31.698
And he's in your
chemistry class.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.978
His name is Christian Newville.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.500
Do you know him?

21:37.540 --> 21:39.658
No.

21:39.660 --> 21:40.699
No I don't.

21:40.701 --> 21:43.580
Well he's new and beautiful.

21:44.821 --> 21:46.219
There's just
something about him.

21:46.221 --> 21:50.861
He looks so soulful and I
can't get him to talk to me.

21:51.701 --> 21:55.459
And how do you know
he is not an idiot?

21:55.461 --> 21:57.861
First of all,
he's is an artist.

21:58.941 --> 22:01.338
I saw him painting when I
walked by our class and he's

22:01.340 --> 22:06.058
really good.
Plus, I can see it in his eyes.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.459
And that's enough to go on?

22:07.461 --> 22:10.379
Okay, you've been reading way
too many Jane Austen novels.

22:10.381 --> 22:14.098
Whoa! There's no such thing as
too many Jane Austen novels.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.579
I still don't understand what
all this has to do with me.

22:16.581 --> 22:18.339
Well, you're a guy.

22:18.341 --> 22:19.859
Last time I checked, yeah.

22:19.861 --> 22:24.739
And he's a guy and you're both
a little bit shy around girls.

22:24.741 --> 22:26.578
How does that qualify
me to help you.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.379
I don't have any classes
with him and you do, so I was

22:29.381 --> 22:33.178
hoping you could introduce
yourself and tell him you're my

22:33.180 --> 22:35.259
friend and get him to text me.
Please?

22:35.261 --> 22:37.698
Do you want me to
pass him a note?

22:37.700 --> 22:39.578
Do you like me,
Yes or no, check one.

22:39.580 --> 22:40.619
You don't have to be mean.

22:40.621 --> 22:41.901
Do I look like Tinder to you?

22:43.620 --> 22:46.659
Okay, you know what, it's fine.
Just forget it.

22:46.661 --> 22:49.778
Roxy, Roxy, wait.
Just wait a second.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.538
I'm sorry, alright.

22:51.540 --> 22:55.541
No, I'm-I'm sorry.
It was stupid thing to ask.

22:56.420 --> 22:57.260
No.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.500
If I see him, I'll ask him.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.538
Really?

23:01.540 --> 23:03.178
Yeah, really.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.780
Thank you.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.699
Okay, I have to go
cause I'm late for Lit,

23:10.701 --> 23:13.541
but uhm, you're the best.
Love you.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.698
Yeah, I love you too.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.898
She looked happy.
That's got to be good news.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.099
Or not.

23:21.101 --> 23:23.298
I could use another
one of those.

23:23.300 --> 23:26.339
Bronwyn, I just finished the
scene in the abattoir and it's-

23:26.341 --> 23:28.099
well it's magnificent.

23:28.101 --> 23:30.259
You should come and hear it.
Come, come.

23:30.261 --> 23:33.661
If you ever loved me, you'd
shoot me in the face right now.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.299
So, any luck with Roxy?

24:35.301 --> 24:38.178
No. I can't think
of anything to say to her.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.019
Just as well. I mean, you don't
want to rush things, right?

24:40.021 --> 24:42.101
You should invite her
to our ten-year reunion.

24:44.421 --> 24:45.858
I don't know what's
gotten into you, man.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.738
Like what's your problem?
You're a good looking guy.

24:47.740 --> 24:49.418
Empirically.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.420
It's just a rational fact,
like, take a look around.

24:54.420 --> 24:56.940
You move to any girl here
and they'd be all over you.

24:58.021 --> 24:59.258
Roxy's different.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.979
No she's not.
She's a hot chick.

25:00.981 --> 25:02.179
All hot chicks are the same.

25:02.181 --> 25:04.419
They post a selfie on Facebook
with the caption "Just me" and

25:04.421 --> 25:06.258
everyone and their dog tells
them how hot they are, but they

25:06.260 --> 25:08.539
spell HAWT for some reason and
the hot chick just gobbles it up

25:08.541 --> 25:09.859
like a kid with Halloween candy.

25:11.141 --> 25:12.819
It's a crock, I mean they
say "OMG, so gorgeous."

25:12.821 --> 25:14.058
She knows she's gorgeous.

25:14.060 --> 25:15.378
She just want's
you to know that.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.499
God help you if you post
something she doesn't like.

25:16.501 --> 25:18.299
Then it's block, delete and
a Facebook status update,

25:18.301 --> 25:19.939
now she rid yourself of
negative influences in her life.

25:19.941 --> 25:20.938
It's pathetic.

25:20.940 --> 25:22.218
Erica Anderson?

25:22.220 --> 25:23.739
I'm in love with her.

25:23.741 --> 25:25.218
Drives me crazy.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.978
That's not the point.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.419
The point is, you have a genetic
leg up on guys like me so just

25:29.421 --> 25:30.939
go talk to her already.

25:30.941 --> 25:33.258
I will. Soon.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.540
Ohhh, ha, ha, ha.

25:37.701 --> 25:40.741
Dude, how did this even start
between you and her anyway?

25:44.581 --> 25:46.099
No one remembers.

25:46.101 --> 25:51.138
I just know I'm
going to finish it.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.098
Hey.

25:52.100 --> 25:56.338
I know what will get
you to talk to Roxy.

25:56.340 --> 25:57.699
Oh no.

25:57.701 --> 26:00.819
Oh yes. Behold the power and
majesty of the dare book.

26:00.821 --> 26:03.578
Look on my works ye
mighty and despair.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.299
I can't believe you
still have that thing.

26:05.301 --> 26:06.579
How does it work you ask?

26:06.581 --> 26:09.058
Once a dare is recorded in the
book, a dare must be completed

26:09.060 --> 26:10.739
or you'll be looked upon as
a coward for the rest of

26:10.741 --> 26:12.659
your days. Your
honor is at stake.

26:12.661 --> 26:15.298
I don't need the
dare book, okay.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.779
I'll talk to her.

26:16.781 --> 26:18.701
No. I've got something better.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.900
Forget about Roxy.

26:21.901 --> 26:24.418
I dare you to make a
nose joke to Cyrus.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.379
Didn't you tell
me not to do that?

26:26.381 --> 26:27.459
Of course I did.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.658
That guy will ruin your life.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.499
Nevertheless, the dare stands.
It's going in the book.

26:31.501 --> 26:33.098
No. Forget it.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.299
I'm writing down chicken.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.379
Hey, I'm not a chicken, I'm
just not a complete jerk, okay.

26:37.381 --> 26:39.101
Okay, I'll sweeten the deal.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.860
You're so full of it, Liner.

26:44.421 --> 26:45.898
No man.
Forget it.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.380
I don't even know that guy.
I'm out.

26:50.341 --> 26:51.458
I'll take it.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.458
It's kind of a personal thing
between me and Christian.

26:53.460 --> 26:54.538
Yeah. You put the money down.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.858
So if Newville is too much
of a pussy, then I'll do it.

26:57.860 --> 26:59.219
What are you gonna say?

26:59.221 --> 27:01.778
Nothing. I'm going to punch
him in his big fat nose.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.219
I said insult, not assault.

27:03.221 --> 27:06.018
I think a punch to the face is
pretty insulting, don't you?

27:06.020 --> 27:07.538
Now come on man. That guy
didn't do anything to you.

27:07.540 --> 27:08.738
Just leave him alone.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.699
I don't like his face.
I don't like his attitude

27:10.701 --> 27:12.621
and I'm about to
adjust both for him.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.420
Excuse me!

27:17.860 --> 27:21.418
Cyrus, uhm,

27:21.420 --> 27:23.019
I was wondering.

27:23.021 --> 27:26.058
Can you smell my lunch from
there because, damn!

27:26.060 --> 27:29.419
Ha, ha, ha.
Ohhh!

27:29.421 --> 27:32.658
Sick burn, man. Awesome.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.660
I'll see you at practice.

27:36.141 --> 27:38.338
Who's your friend, Lee?

27:38.340 --> 27:40.541
Him? It's more of an
acquaintance, really.

27:41.539 --> 27:41.379
Dude!

27:41.381 --> 27:42.378
I need a name.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.298
Dude, don't tell my...

27:43.300 --> 27:45.338
Christian.
His name's Christian.

27:45.340 --> 27:46.819
Dude!

27:46.821 --> 27:49.861
Well Christian, You picked a
very bad day to be a smart ass.

27:51.980 --> 27:53.459
Christian Newville?

27:53.461 --> 28:01.338
Yeah?

28:01.340 --> 28:03.578
Thank you, Cyrus.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.259
And I actually don't even
really know him that well.

28:06.261 --> 28:08.338
Shut up.
He, he totally knows me, okay.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.339
Not nose like, nose.
That one was an accident.

28:11.341 --> 28:12.261
Lee, beat it.

28:16.020 --> 28:19.139
Look, I'm not like that, man.
I am so sorry.

28:19.141 --> 28:22.298
Don't worry about it.
At least your joke was original.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.379
Look, I'm a friend of Roxy's.

28:24.381 --> 28:26.019
She asked me to talk to you.

28:26.021 --> 28:27.939
Oh.

28:27.941 --> 28:30.018
Ohh! Oh that's great!

28:30.020 --> 28:32.140
Yeah. It's terrific.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.618
She wants you to text her.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.099
Yes!

28:36.101 --> 28:37.779
Again, I am so sorry, man.

28:37.781 --> 28:40.298
I just...

28:40.300 --> 28:41.378
Stupid tax.

28:41.380 --> 28:44.139
Oh, yeah okay.

28:44.141 --> 28:45.898
What should I say to her.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.460
What would you normally say?

28:48.100 --> 28:49.381
Umm-

28:50.061 --> 28:51.979
"Sup" I guess.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.459
Does that always work for you?

28:54.461 --> 28:56.019
Yeah. Pretty much.

28:56.021 --> 28:58.658
Course it does.
Look at you.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.419
Still, you're going to have
to aim a little higher.

29:00.421 --> 29:02.098
I know. That's why I had
trouble talking to her

29:02.100 --> 29:03.258
in the first place.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.779
Just talk to her about art.

29:04.781 --> 29:06.138
Discuss Michelangelo
or something.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.580
The ninja turtle?

29:08.941 --> 29:10.419
The artist?

29:10.421 --> 29:12.139
Aren't you an artist?

29:12.141 --> 29:13.539
I don't know, man.

29:13.541 --> 29:16.139
I mean, I just like to paint.

29:16.141 --> 29:17.539
Okay.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.819
God if I looked like
you I wouldn't have

29:19.821 --> 29:21.298
trouble talking to anyone.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.501
If I was smart like you maybe I
could think of something to say.

29:26.701 --> 29:28.341
Give me your phone for a second.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.858
What are you going to do?

29:31.860 --> 29:33.980
We are texting Roxy.

29:35.420 --> 29:37.700
It's a Chekhov quote.
Trust me, she'll love it.

29:44.101 --> 29:46.019
It's Christian.

29:46.021 --> 29:49.059
Please don't be an idiot,
please don't be an idiot.

29:49.061 --> 29:52.139
Oh my God.
He just quoted Chekhov at me.

29:52.141 --> 29:53.978
Hmm. Yeah.

29:53.980 --> 29:55.699
Super hot.

29:55.701 --> 29:58.659
Oh! She texted back.

29:58.661 --> 30:00.378
Boy, that was quick.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.219
What'd she say?

30:02.221 --> 30:06.058
Well as Miguel says, one of
the most telling things about a

30:06.060 --> 30:08.458
person is how they say hello.

30:08.460 --> 30:09.699
Who's Miguel?

30:09.701 --> 30:11.658
No idea.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.738
Even I can't keep up with her.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.699
Oh, which reminds me.

30:15.701 --> 30:17.578
She's big into
Russian lit right now.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.900
You might want to read this.

30:20.461 --> 30:23.618
Chekhov? Like the Star Trek guy?

30:23.620 --> 30:26.658
Wouldn't mention
that if I were you.

30:26.660 --> 30:29.378
Also brushing up on Dostoevsky
couldn't hurt and you'll need a

30:29.380 --> 30:32.099
working knowledge of Bronte,
Emily Dickinson and Jane Austen.

30:32.101 --> 30:33.778
I didn't know there'd
be a reading list.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.019
Well, she's worth it, isn't she?

30:35.021 --> 30:37.059
Oh, for sure, man. Yeah.

30:37.061 --> 30:40.180
Then dust off the library card.
Be good to her.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.379
Hey!

30:42.381 --> 30:44.739
Thanks. A lot, man.

30:44.741 --> 30:47.498
I mean, I really like her.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.979
What are you-
No. Touching.

30:49.981 --> 30:52.058
Personal space.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.300
Eww!

30:57.820 --> 31:00.499
Cyrus, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

31:00.501 --> 31:02.139
I take it he texted you.

31:02.141 --> 31:05.178
He did and he was eloquent and
sweet and not at all stupid,

31:05.180 --> 31:06.540
so there.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.460
And then he wrote this.

31:09.981 --> 31:11.779
He wrote that?

31:11.781 --> 31:15.179
I mean, yeah of course
obviously he wrote that.

31:15.181 --> 31:16.898
Ehm, how did you get that.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.499
I found it in my locker.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.258
It's a love letter,
which is crazy, right?

31:21.260 --> 31:23.658
I mean I hardly know the guy.

31:23.660 --> 31:25.259
That is crazy.

31:25.261 --> 31:27.900
Like, so crazy you probably
shouldn't date him.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.819
At all.

31:30.821 --> 31:33.661
Hey, I thought so too,
but on the other hand,

31:34.540 --> 31:37.219
it is so beautiful.

31:37.221 --> 31:38.458
Beautiful.

31:38.460 --> 31:39.939
B-beautiful how?

31:39.941 --> 31:41.538
Just listen to this.

31:41.540 --> 31:43.979
"You're like a rose pressed
between the pages of an old

31:43.981 --> 31:45.381
book of romantic poetry.

31:46.180 --> 31:49.899
A startling beauty surround and
nourished by words of love."

31:49.901 --> 31:51.099
You don't think that's cheesy?

31:51.101 --> 31:53.941
No! It's beautiful and
heartfelt, you hater.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.658
I just feel like he's
known me my whole life.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.058
Like he just knows
the way I think.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.458
Well they could have copied and
pasted that from the internet.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.658
It's not unheard of.

32:02.660 --> 32:05.539
Yes, but he mentions very
specific things about me.

32:05.541 --> 32:09.301
Horoscopes seem very specific
to people who believe in them.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.418
"When you wore your hair up last
week it was like a curtain was

32:13.420 --> 32:16.099
pulled back to reveal the
real you, kind and radiant."

32:16.101 --> 32:17.818
Hmm. Barf.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.339
Hey! He's a genius and I
want you to acknowledge it.

32:20.341 --> 32:22.379
Genius! That seems a bit much.

32:22.381 --> 32:23.578
Yes! He's a genius. Say it!

32:23.580 --> 32:25.859
Okay, oww! Psycho.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.381
Fine. He's a genius.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.419
There, was that so hard to say?

32:31.421 --> 32:32.979
No.

32:32.981 --> 32:34.258
Okay, see you Monday.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.098
Wait. You're skipping
fourth period?

32:36.100 --> 32:37.299
I'm leaving early.

32:37.301 --> 32:46.138
We're going out to the coast
to see my aunt this weekend.

32:46.140 --> 32:49.019
Thank you.

32:49.021 --> 32:50.818
Thank you so much.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.498
She's thanking
me for my letter.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.858
What letter?
There's a letter?

33:08.860 --> 33:11.659
Ahh, yeah.
I thought I'd help you out.

33:11.661 --> 33:13.901
It's fine, here.
I'll answer it.

33:15.021 --> 33:16.421
"You're welcome.

33:17.140 --> 33:18.778
Currently stuck in chem class.

33:18.780 --> 33:21.298
Not the chemistry I was
hoping for this weekend."

33:21.300 --> 33:24.298
Take care and have fun.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.460
Done.

33:28.901 --> 33:30.978
There see,
"You too" and three hearts.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.580
How am I supposed to
do this all weekend?

33:35.700 --> 33:38.578
Okay, here's something
I've been working on.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.459
It will forward your
texts to me and I'll

33:40.461 --> 33:41.499
respond to them for you.

33:41.501 --> 33:44.179
Isn't this like
I'm lying to her?

33:44.181 --> 33:45.458
Well you like her, right?

33:45.460 --> 33:46.939
Yeah. I do, but...

33:46.941 --> 33:49.259
Let's think of it like buying a
card that somebody else wrote.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.819
The important part is that
the emotion is genuine.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.019
I dunno man.

33:53.021 --> 33:55.740
I mean it's really cool and
all, but why are you helping me?

33:57.101 --> 33:58.781
I need to know what she'd say.

34:00.740 --> 34:03.340
Ahh, it's just
interesting to me.

34:04.580 --> 34:05.980
Like a social experiment.

34:06.821 --> 34:10.138
Plus, she's happy and you're
happy, so it's a win-win.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.619
All right class,
let's settle down.

34:11.621 --> 34:15.378
Mr Chase is sick today, so
I'll be covering for him again.

34:15.380 --> 34:18.178
Probably just a hangover.
I thought you should know

34:18.179 --> 34:21.858
that since apparently
you're the reason the drinks.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.219
So if all uf us can turn to
chapter seven for those of

34:24.221 --> 34:26.221
you who wish to follow along.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.737
Mr. Nolan!

34:28.739 --> 34:30.179
Is that a phone I see?

34:30.181 --> 34:31.701
Oh! Ahh, sorry Sir.

34:32.701 --> 34:34.058
You will be.

34:34.060 --> 34:35.300
Put it away.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.658
Okay, we'll get your social
media up to scratch his weekend

34:39.659 --> 34:41.018
and that'll be the end of it.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.580
Nolan!

34:47.940 --> 34:49.018
What did you do?

34:49.021 --> 34:51.058
I didn't do this.
It was Liner.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.579
I mean the letter.

34:52.581 --> 34:53.659
Oh, that.

34:53.661 --> 34:54.737
You're welcome.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.498
Yeah. Thank you so much.

34:56.501 --> 34:58.218
Now Roxy thinks it
came from Christian.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.899
But you told it
was from you, right?

35:00.901 --> 35:02.379
Not exactly.

35:02.381 --> 35:03.298
Why not?

35:03.300 --> 35:04.978
I'm kind of helping him out.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.419
Have you seen that dude?

35:06.421 --> 35:07.659
He doesn't need your help.

35:07.661 --> 35:08.658
Why would you do that.

35:08.660 --> 35:10.099
Because I want her to be happy.

35:10.101 --> 35:11.298
You don't want you to be happy?

35:11.300 --> 35:12.619
If she's happy, I'm happy.

35:12.621 --> 35:14.539
You know he gets the way
better end of the deal, right?

35:14.541 --> 35:17.581
You get to do the work
and he gets to do-her.

35:18.501 --> 35:20.299
That's a mental image
I was trying to avoid.

35:20.301 --> 35:22.059
So why would
you help this guy?

35:22.061 --> 35:24.821
Because, he can
be the me I can't.

35:25.621 --> 35:27.740
He can be the me she deserves.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.018
The one she wants.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.498
Has it ever occurred
to you that you might

35:31.500 --> 35:32.778
be the one she wants.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.501
I'm not the one anyone wants.

35:35.741 --> 35:39.018
Besides, now I can
at least be involved

35:39.020 --> 35:41.379
on some level with
her romantically.

35:41.381 --> 35:43.058
Even though she's holding him,

35:43.060 --> 35:44.419
in a weird way she's
kind of holding me too.

35:44.421 --> 35:47.178
And in another real-world
not delusional way,

35:47.180 --> 35:48.501
she's not holding you.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.899
At all.

35:50.901 --> 35:53.059
It's better than nothing. I've
had 10 years of almost nothing.

35:53.061 --> 35:54.979
I'll take what I can get.

35:54.981 --> 35:57.938
If Cyrus helps a hot guy get
a girl, even though Cyrus is in

35:57.940 --> 36:02.018
love with that girl,
will that end well for him?

36:02.020 --> 36:04.379
Absolutely not.

36:04.381 --> 36:06.858
See even she thinks
you're a dumb ass.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.819
Thank you as always for
your sympathy and kind words.

36:08.821 --> 36:09.938
You're welcome.

36:09.940 --> 36:11.140
Dumb Ass.

36:12.301 --> 36:13.340
Okay...

36:25.901 --> 36:27.218
Are you alright?

36:27.220 --> 36:31.539
Yup, I just need a minute.

36:31.541 --> 36:32.378
Liner?

36:32.380 --> 36:33.221
Uh huh.

36:34.180 --> 36:36.019
Now are you going to
finish this thing or

36:36.021 --> 36:37.138
am I going to have to?

36:37.140 --> 36:39.459
Oh, I'm going to finish it.

36:39.461 --> 36:40.778
Good.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.698
Class starts in three minutes.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.978
Okay, I'll just finish
up this heart attack

36:44.980 --> 36:46.459
and I'll be right there.

36:46.461 --> 36:48.301
Fair enough.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.498
Let's get to class.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.379
Okay, so I've tweaked
your Twitter and Instagram.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.378
Got you on Snapchat and
sepia toned the hell out

36:58.380 --> 37:01.459
of everything. We also
cleared your Facebook page.

37:01.461 --> 37:02.938
Won't that look suspicious?

37:02.940 --> 37:05.698
Better.
It will look mysterious.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.978
Really?

37:06.980 --> 37:09.819
Yeah, you gotta play
the long game with Roxy.

37:09.821 --> 37:11.619
She's old fashioned,
Needs to wooed.

37:11.621 --> 37:13.578
Doesn't like to
rush into anything.

37:13.580 --> 37:16.658
Plus, she doesn't need to
see your parade of ex's.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.341
- Good call.
- Mmm Uh.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.139
I also took the liberty
of signing you up for Skype.

37:21.141 --> 37:23.138
She uses it to talk to
relatives back east.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.099
Sweet! Thanks man.

37:25.101 --> 37:26.938
Hey, I'm gonna check my email,
see if she wrote me.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.498
Oh yeah. Ahh, she might have.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.859
Because I dropped her a quick
line when I was on there.

37:31.861 --> 37:33.020
Oh, let me see.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.379
"Technology is a funny thing.

37:40.381 --> 37:43.298
I feel closer to you
than I've ever been,

37:43.300 --> 37:45.178
yet still so isolated."

37:45.180 --> 37:46.938
What's that mean?

37:46.940 --> 37:49.180
It's a poetic metaphor.
Don't worry about it.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.221
Answer call.

37:54.221 --> 37:55.818
Uhmm, yes.

37:55.820 --> 37:57.060
No, no wait!

37:59.581 --> 38:01.979
Hey, you're on my screen.
Awesome.

38:01.981 --> 38:04.458
Yeah, I looked you up.
We got back early and I got

38:04.460 --> 38:08.260
your email about feeling
isolated so, here I am.

38:09.341 --> 38:12.779
Yeah.

38:12.781 --> 38:15.138
Yeah, there you are. Hi.

38:15.140 --> 38:15.939
Hi.

38:15.941 --> 38:17.018
How was your trip?

38:17.020 --> 38:19.899
It was good, but umm, I
was a little bit distracted.

38:19.901 --> 38:21.778
Someone sent me a few texts.

38:21.780 --> 38:22.699
Who?

38:22.701 --> 38:24.859
Gee, I wonder?
No, seriously,

38:24.861 --> 38:27.661
if you send me anymore, I'd
have to change my phone plan.

38:30.181 --> 38:32.099
Hey, is everything okay?

38:32.101 --> 38:33.658
You seem distracted.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.139
Ah, ah, no.
Everything's fine.

38:36.141 --> 38:37.898
Sorry about all those texts.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.499
No. No, no, no, don't be sorry.

38:40.501 --> 38:42.139
I loved everyone of them.

38:42.141 --> 38:45.339
I mean sure if it was just
banal chit chat it might have

38:45.341 --> 38:49.378
been annoying, but you always
seem to have something to say

38:49.380 --> 38:52.459
and I really like that.

38:52.461 --> 38:55.099
Well. At least I
didn't write, "Sup".

38:55.101 --> 38:56.621
Exactly.

38:57.781 --> 39:00.539
You know this is going to
sound really stupid because

39:00.541 --> 39:03.260
I barely know you, but uhm-

39:05.021 --> 39:06.299
I missed you.

39:06.301 --> 39:08.618
Uhm.

39:08.620 --> 39:09.581
It's not stupid.

39:11.501 --> 39:13.299
It's not stupid.

39:13.301 --> 39:15.579
I feel like I've
been missing you.

39:15.581 --> 39:17.461
I feel like
I've been missing you.

39:18.540 --> 39:19.340
My whole life.

39:19.621 --> 39:20.578
My whole life.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.378
Oh wow.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.178
I'm in trouble here.

39:24.180 --> 39:25.940
You really are slick,
Christian Newville.

39:28.301 --> 39:29.741
Aristotle said-

39:30.421 --> 39:32.499
- Aris turle said...
- No! Aristotle!

39:32.501 --> 39:34.779
Ah, No, Aris... Aristotle....

39:34.781 --> 39:37.419
Aristotle said that running
from trouble is cowardice.

39:37.421 --> 39:41.538
That guy said, "running
from trouble is cowardice."

39:41.540 --> 39:43.498
I didn't
say I was running.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.339
Well you must have been,

39:45.341 --> 39:47.739
because you've been running
through my mind all day.

39:47.741 --> 39:49.259
Cute.

39:49.261 --> 39:53.898
Uhm, this has been fun, but I
actually have to jet because...

39:53.900 --> 39:55.859
No ah, hey, I uhm.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.098
I like your shoes.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.218
You can't see my shoes.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.979
I meant generally
as, as a rule.

40:01.981 --> 40:07.061
Okay. I hope you don't
mind me saying, it's just-

40:08.621 --> 40:10.058
you don't seem like the

40:10.060 --> 40:12.019
kind of guy who would write
a love letter like that.

40:12.021 --> 40:16.099
But ahh, sure.
I-I write them all the time.

40:16.101 --> 40:17.259
Excuse me?

40:17.261 --> 40:18.259
Well, I...

40:18.261 --> 40:19.499
Who else have you
written them to.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.858
I... No, no one.

40:20.860 --> 40:23.700
Whoa, I can't see you anymore.

40:25.661 --> 40:27.458
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
camera issues I guess.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.419
Well your voice
sounds really weird.

40:29.421 --> 40:32.418
Ahh yeah, the connection
is just a little wonky.

40:32.420 --> 40:34.458
I have an essay, so maybe...

40:34.460 --> 40:37.260
Ahh, wait, before you go
just, just let me apologize.

40:39.101 --> 40:40.658
I get a bit
flustered around you.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.780
Well, that's very sweet.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.778
You know, why don't
I just call you back.

40:46.780 --> 40:50.501
No, no, no, I, I like
it better like this.

40:51.541 --> 40:52.501
But I can't see you.

40:53.501 --> 40:54.861
Exactly.

40:55.501 --> 40:58.581
I'm tired of being judged
by what I look like.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.100
Yeah. I guess I can
understand that.

41:04.061 --> 41:06.299
People don't take
you seriously.

41:06.301 --> 41:07.541
No.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.619
And someone comes into my life

41:11.621 --> 41:15.298
and suddenly it's very important
that I be taken seriously.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.619
Why is that?

41:16.621 --> 41:18.300
Because I'm serious about her.

41:19.941 --> 41:21.581
That's a bold statement.

41:23.461 --> 41:26.178
It's a bold feeling.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.339
I'm not even sure the
statement does it justice.

41:28.341 --> 41:29.941
What statement would?

41:33.820 --> 41:36.420
It's your sonnet walking
in a world of prose.

41:39.021 --> 41:42.541
A star that brings warmth and
light to everyone in our orbit.

41:45.100 --> 41:47.619
I ventured into
being cheesy now.

41:47.621 --> 41:49.818
No. I like cheese.

41:49.820 --> 41:52.299
Cheese is good.
I love cheese.

41:52.301 --> 41:56.539
Roxy, I feel like I've
been carrying a weight and word

41:56.541 --> 41:59.741
by word the burden gets
lighter as I talk to you.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.699
I'm so in love with you and
I, I know that seems quick,

42:04.701 --> 42:09.378
but believe me my whole life
has been building up to this.

42:09.380 --> 42:10.698
I believe you.

42:10.700 --> 42:14.018
This is the moment that songs
and poems are about.

42:14.020 --> 42:19.539
This moment between two
people over shitty speakers,

42:19.541 --> 42:21.540
staring into a blank screen.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.979
So, thank you for this.

42:25.981 --> 42:27.781
Even if this is
all we ever have.

42:29.500 --> 42:33.058
Because I'm never
gonna forget it.

42:33.060 --> 42:35.978
You're like something
out of a dream.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.340
Do I pass the test?

42:38.740 --> 42:41.499
With flying colors.

42:41.501 --> 42:42.741
Can I come over?

42:43.581 --> 42:44.459
Shut up you idiot!

42:44.461 --> 42:45.461
What?

42:46.140 --> 42:47.778
Ahh, sorry.

42:47.780 --> 42:53.741
I just felt like I was rushing
you so I told myself to shut up.

42:55.101 --> 42:56.619
Hang on a sec.

42:56.621 --> 42:57.618
Okay, what the hell!

42:57.620 --> 42:58.819
What?

42:58.821 --> 43:00.138
I told you, you got to
take it slow with her.

43:00.140 --> 43:02.058
You just told her I love her.

43:02.060 --> 43:02.978
I know what I'm doing.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.419
So do I. I'm going over there.

43:04.421 --> 43:05.579
No you're not.

43:05.581 --> 43:07.061
Hey, it's gonna happen
one way or the other.

43:09.101 --> 43:10.298
Fine.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.858
I just, just let me
handle it, alright.

43:11.860 --> 43:13.900
Alright. Alright.

43:16.101 --> 43:18.099
Ask her if I should
bring condoms.

43:18.101 --> 43:21.019
Or not. That's cool.

43:21.021 --> 43:22.898
For the record,
I'm against this.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.020
This is way too fast for her.

43:26.021 --> 43:28.980
You can come over.
How soon can you get here.

43:30.061 --> 43:32.139
Ah, I, I'm not
coming on too strong?

43:32.141 --> 43:33.619
No, not at all.

43:33.621 --> 43:36.699
Uhm, but you should know
my parents are here.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.018
Good.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.459
Good, I'd like to congratulate
them on their excellent work.

43:40.461 --> 43:42.978
I also have some
tutoring to do.

43:42.980 --> 43:45.499
Steve Guishe is coming over.

43:45.501 --> 43:47.099
That guy?

43:47.101 --> 43:50.218
Yeah, I know. He's a
Neanderthal with a $200 haircut.

43:50.220 --> 43:55.538
Just um-give me five minutes.
I'll text you my address.

43:55.540 --> 43:57.299
Be there when I open my window.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.498
What about Steve?

43:58.500 --> 43:59.701
Don't worry about him.

44:00.581 --> 44:02.821
I have a super
hero on speed dial.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.939
Ahh, hello, hello?

44:11.941 --> 44:13.779
Hi. Where you?

44:13.781 --> 44:15.219
Ahh, I'm in my house.

44:15.221 --> 44:17.099
Where I always am.
Where else would I be?

44:17.101 --> 44:18.978
I was on Skype, I thought
I heard your ring tone.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.819
Yeah, yeah probably
just feed back.

44:21.821 --> 44:22.978
What's up?

44:22.980 --> 44:24.978
Christian is coming over.

44:24.980 --> 44:28.179
Yes, yes, please continue to
regale me with your love life.

44:28.181 --> 44:29.898
Steve Guishe is
also coming over.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.939
You little Minx.

44:30.941 --> 44:32.259
Eww. To study!

44:32.261 --> 44:33.058
Anatomy?

44:33.060 --> 44:34.419
Kay, just be serious.

44:34.421 --> 44:37.219
I need you to delay Steve
for as long as you can.

44:37.221 --> 44:38.219
How?

44:38.221 --> 44:41.578
I don't know.
Do a computer thing?

44:41.580 --> 44:43.019
Do a computer thing?

44:43.021 --> 44:44.619
Okay, well I hadn't
really thought it through.

44:44.621 --> 44:45.698
Evidently not.

44:45.700 --> 44:48.099
It wouldn't be long,
I just want a few minutes

44:48.101 --> 44:49.298
face-to-face with him.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.218
Okay, what am I supposed
to do, stop time?

44:51.220 --> 44:52.258
Because there's not
an app for that.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.180
Please, please, please.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.581
I think I'm falling for him.

44:58.100 --> 44:59.900
Fine, I'll do
the computer thing.

45:00.581 --> 45:01.380
You're the best.

45:04.860 --> 45:06.618
Yeah, I'm heading
over there right now.

45:06.620 --> 45:18.618
We're gonna study.
Study hard. Ha, ha.

45:18.620 --> 45:19.738
Roxy.

45:33.141 --> 45:34.701
Ah, check you later bro

45:39.300 --> 45:42.379
Oh Romeo, Romeo
wherefor art thou, Romeo.

45:42.381 --> 45:45.418
Deny thy father and refuse
thy name or thou wilt not

45:45.420 --> 45:48.820
be but sworn my love and
I will no longer be Capulet.

45:49.340 --> 45:50.181
What?

45:51.660 --> 45:53.020
Just come up.

46:25.541 --> 46:26.541
Hi.

46:28.061 --> 46:29.260
Hi.

46:50.301 --> 46:52.341
My parents are
still downstairs.

46:53.101 --> 46:55.261
Right, yeah.
I remember.

46:57.580 --> 46:59.260
Can we talk for a bit?

47:00.461 --> 47:02.221
Yeah. Um, sure.

47:03.141 --> 47:04.621
Okay.

47:10.021 --> 47:15.979
Come here.

47:15.981 --> 47:19.019
I've been dying to do this
ever since I first saw you.

47:19.021 --> 47:20.779
I could get used to it.

47:20.781 --> 47:22.301
You're going to have to.

47:24.261 --> 47:26.818
So where did you find
that Chekhov quote?

47:26.820 --> 47:29.859
Cyru... ahh clopedia.
The encyclopedia.

47:29.861 --> 47:32.380
They still print those?

47:32.381 --> 47:34.458
Wickedpedia?

47:34.460 --> 47:36.098
Wikipedia.

47:36.100 --> 47:38.539
Yeah, that.

47:38.541 --> 47:42.820
Oh, well umm, you should
really try Chekhov sometime.

47:43.541 --> 47:45.379
There's a melancholy
to his words.

47:45.381 --> 47:59.419
It's a perfect metaphor
for the suburbs.

47:59.421 --> 48:01.099
What are you
reading right now?

48:01.101 --> 48:03.419
Oh, like a book?

48:03.421 --> 48:05.699
Yeah, very much
like a book, you goof.

48:05.701 --> 48:09.218
I've been real busy lately.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.658
I did read a comic, though.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.619
You like graphic novels?

48:11.621 --> 48:12.659
Yeah.

48:12.661 --> 48:14.979
I read Persepolis.
It's really great.

48:14.981 --> 48:18.019
It's a bio about a young women
growing up in Iran after the

48:18.021 --> 48:19.659
Islamic revolution.

48:19.661 --> 48:20.821
This one had Archie in it.

48:22.540 --> 48:23.741
Veronica is hot.

48:27.181 --> 48:29.418
I think I hear my parents.

48:29.420 --> 48:30.699
Uhm, you should go.

48:30.701 --> 48:32.698
You should...
sorry.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.218
You should go.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.219
Oh okay.

48:36.221 --> 48:37.979
So we're not gonna make out?

48:37.981 --> 48:41.139
No. We're not.

48:41.141 --> 48:42.419
Okay. That's cool.

48:55.381 --> 48:56.739
Hey.

48:56.741 --> 48:58.179
Are you mad?

48:58.181 --> 48:59.138
No.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.698
You seem like you're mad.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.899
I just thought you were
someone who shared my interests

49:02.901 --> 49:04.898
and I guess I was wrong.

49:04.900 --> 49:09.618
No, wait, I, I totally
like words and junk.

49:09.620 --> 49:12.099
What if I wrote you a poem.

49:12.101 --> 49:13.898
Okay.

49:13.900 --> 49:15.058
I'm listening.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.219
What?

49:16.221 --> 49:17.419
Like right now?

49:17.421 --> 49:19.661
Yeah. Right now. Impress me.

49:31.980 --> 49:34.780
Your eyes are like the ocean.

49:36.221 --> 49:37.778
Deep in blue.

49:37.780 --> 49:44.341
With waves that
whisper, I love you.

49:47.541 --> 49:48.899
I like your hair.

49:48.901 --> 49:51.380
It smells so fruity.

49:52.461 --> 49:54.700
But most of all

49:56.220 --> 49:58.218
I'd like to hit that booty.

49:58.220 --> 49:59.018
Just get out!

49:59.020 --> 50:00.459
What? I-I don't understand.

50:00.461 --> 50:01.698
I thought it was
headed that way.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.659
Yeah, maybe if you
weren't being a total pig.

50:03.661 --> 50:05.059
But, it rhymed though.
I just...

50:05.061 --> 50:06.978
You just thought you'd come up
here for a couple minutes and

50:06.980 --> 50:08.619
tell me what you'd
like to do to my booty?

50:08.621 --> 50:09.739
Normal girls like that.

50:09.741 --> 50:11.059
Oh, so I'm abnormal now.

50:11.061 --> 50:12.378
Okay I didn't mean it like that.

50:12.380 --> 50:14.298
Look, I don't know what
happened to the smart sweet guy

50:14.300 --> 50:16.219
I just talked to, but apparently
that was somebody else.

50:16.221 --> 50:17.181
No!

50:17.940 --> 50:20.099
I, I mean, no, why
would you even...

50:20.101 --> 50:25.818
Hey, I saw your shoes
and I really like 'em.

50:25.820 --> 50:27.858
Honey,
Are you alright in there?

50:27.860 --> 50:31.298
I'm fine. I'm just rehearsing
lines for drama class.

50:46.341 --> 50:47.701
Just go.

51:01.180 --> 51:03.978
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

51:03.980 --> 51:06.018
You're about to get a free
nose job, you little shit.

51:08.581 --> 51:10.459
Oh, I get it. If I knew
you were pimping her out

51:10.461 --> 51:11.661
I would have slipped
you some cash.

51:24.980 --> 51:26.980
Hey! You two knock it off!

51:29.940 --> 51:32.058
You! I do not
care who your dad is.

51:32.060 --> 51:34.060
I do not want to see
you around here again.

51:34.781 --> 51:36.179
And you...

51:36.181 --> 51:37.658
I don't know who you are.

51:37.660 --> 51:38.779
I'm Christian Newville, Sir.

51:38.781 --> 51:40.458
Oh, very nice to meet you
Christian, now get the

51:40.460 --> 51:42.181
hell off my lawn.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.418
Are you okay?

51:45.420 --> 51:47.019
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

51:47.021 --> 51:50.179
Ahh, your nose looks
really swollen, Cyrus.

51:50.181 --> 51:52.141
Maybe we should be
getting you to a doctor.

51:53.741 --> 51:56.098
He didn't hit my nose.

51:56.100 --> 51:57.581
Oh.

51:58.220 --> 51:59.700
So what did happen?

52:01.220 --> 52:03.618
Well Steve's been
gunning for me for awhile.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.298
He saw me on my
skateboard and jumped me.

52:05.300 --> 52:07.699
Christian must have seen
and decided to help out.

52:07.701 --> 52:09.978
Well, at least let me
get some ice for your, ahh,

52:09.980 --> 52:12.138
your eye there.

52:12.140 --> 52:14.018
Oh, oh, by the way,
while you're here, my laptop,

52:14.020 --> 52:15.499
it's doing this weird
buzzing noise...

52:15.501 --> 52:17.298
Dad! Dad, just...

52:17.300 --> 52:18.581
OK.

52:19.461 --> 52:20.260
Here.

52:30.461 --> 52:33.541
Well you were right.
Christian is an idiot.

52:35.301 --> 52:36.301
I'm sorry to hear that.

52:37.540 --> 52:38.979
No, you're not.

52:38.981 --> 52:41.578
You love being right.

52:41.580 --> 52:42.900
I don't love it.

52:44.621 --> 52:46.259
I'm just so damn good at.

52:48.421 --> 52:49.781
Well Mr Right.

52:50.620 --> 52:54.499
Thank you for
covering for me, again.

52:54.501 --> 52:55.421
You're welcome.

52:59.781 --> 53:02.901
I haven't got the faintest idea
why you put up with me somedays.

53:04.620 --> 53:06.180
Me neither.

53:07.501 --> 53:09.139
You're a gigantic
pain in the ass.

53:09.141 --> 53:10.101
Ohh!

53:22.501 --> 53:23.501
Hey.

53:27.301 --> 53:29.499
Hey, how' that eye?

53:29.501 --> 53:32.020
It's fine.

53:32.021 --> 53:33.778
Trust me, there's
nothing he could do to my

53:33.780 --> 53:34.739
face to make it worse.

53:34.741 --> 53:37.298
Well it's a good thing
you pulled him off, too.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.978
I was about to really
put the hurt on him.

53:38.980 --> 53:40.858
Yeah, I could tell.

53:40.860 --> 53:42.979
But seriously though, thanks.

53:42.981 --> 53:44.258
No problem.

53:44.260 --> 53:47.259
So, what's our next move?

53:47.261 --> 53:48.259
There isn't one.

53:48.261 --> 53:49.181
What?

53:50.140 --> 53:51.579
I'm out.

53:51.581 --> 53:54.058
No. We can't quit now.
We're so close.

53:54.060 --> 53:56.819
And then you blew it.
Her shoes again?

53:56.821 --> 53:58.819
I heard that girls like it when
you compliment their shoes!

53:58.821 --> 54:00.339
Yeah, they like
it when you notice them,

54:00.341 --> 54:01.218
not obsess over them.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.379
I panicked!

54:02.381 --> 54:03.858
You don't understand.

54:03.860 --> 54:05.138
I'm crazy about her, man!

54:05.140 --> 54:06.538
She's all I think about.

54:06.540 --> 54:08.899
Trust me, I understand.

54:08.901 --> 54:10.539
Answer's still, "No"

54:10.541 --> 54:14.339
Hey, just help me get her back
and I won't ever bug you again.

54:14.341 --> 54:15.938
It's not happening.

54:15.940 --> 54:17.939
I'm not putting her
through that again.

54:17.941 --> 54:22.500
That's my final word.

54:22.501 --> 54:23.739
I understand.

54:23.741 --> 54:25.580
Thanks anyway.

54:27.020 --> 54:32.338
You're welcome.

54:32.340 --> 54:34.340
When I tell this story
later, that went in.

54:48.941 --> 54:50.821
Um, I'll see you guys later.

54:57.220 --> 54:58.938
Do exactly what I tell
you, when I tell you.

54:58.940 --> 55:00.298
I promise.

55:00.300 --> 55:02.578
I'm going to give you some
stuff to memorize later.

55:02.580 --> 55:03.939
Memorize it to the comma.

55:03.941 --> 55:05.698
I will dude, I will!

55:05.700 --> 55:07.019
And no hugs.

55:07.021 --> 55:08.739
I want to make it clear
that I'm not to be hugged.

55:08.741 --> 55:10.699
That makes me sad
for you, but okay.

55:10.701 --> 55:13.418
Your place, 7:30.
Bring Thai food.

55:13.420 --> 55:14.938
I think better
with coconut rice.

55:14.940 --> 55:16.220
You got it.

55:17.580 --> 55:18.378
Christian.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.339
Yeah.

55:20.341 --> 55:21.620
Don't let her down again.

55:28.140 --> 55:30.058
Dude.
What happened to your eye?

55:30.060 --> 55:31.259
Oh, nothing.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.378
Oh, I get it.
First rule of fight club, sure.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.778
Yeah.

55:34.780 --> 55:36.579
Come on, you can tell me about
it on the way to English.

55:36.581 --> 55:37.859
I'm not going to English.

55:37.861 --> 55:38.698
Again?

55:38.700 --> 55:39.899
I'm working on a thing.

55:39.901 --> 55:42.459
Is the thing you're working
on, not failing English,

55:42.461 --> 55:44.218
cause that's the thing
I would highly recommend.

55:44.220 --> 55:46.218
Take notes for me.
I'll catch up later.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.619
Every movie I've ever
seen says that these things

57:11.621 --> 57:12.941
only happen in the rain.

57:14.101 --> 57:16.939
Cute.

57:16.941 --> 57:19.219
I don't know what
it is with you.

57:19.221 --> 57:20.579
It's like you're two
different people.

57:20.581 --> 57:28.498
I know.

57:28.500 --> 57:30.980
I'm not always
articulate in person,

57:32.740 --> 57:35.819
but there is nothing in that-

57:35.821 --> 57:40.218
eloquent about how I feel.

57:40.220 --> 57:42.258
I'll probably say
the wrong thing again,

57:42.260 --> 57:46.020
but my heart will
always feel the same

57:47.500 --> 57:49.418
and I hope that's enough.

57:49.420 --> 57:51.058
Do you want a towel?

57:51.060 --> 57:52.738
No.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.899
I'm just gonna stand out
here until you forgive me.

57:54.901 --> 57:56.819
Whatever it takes.

57:56.821 --> 57:59.538
There comes a time when no
amount of big words can

57:59.540 --> 58:01.458
do this feeling justice.

58:01.460 --> 58:03.620
I've been hiding
behind another face.

58:04.500 --> 58:10.179
But I'm realizing now that's
it's only three words.

58:10.181 --> 58:17.899
Of all the words written, in all
the books, in all the world.

58:17.901 --> 58:20.101
The only three words
that matter are,

58:23.501 --> 58:24.501
"I love you."

58:26.140 --> 58:27.618
And I always will.

59:07.021 --> 59:09.018
What's the object
of this game here?

59:09.020 --> 59:13.818
The object of the game is to
re-establish the patriarchy and

59:13.820 --> 59:17.458
identify alpha males in a
social setting such as school.

59:17.460 --> 59:19.979
The object is to
support my boyfriend.

59:19.981 --> 59:22.299
This is an important practice.

59:22.301 --> 59:24.498
And there are college
scouts here so, shhhh.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.220
Is that why you brought a book?

59:30.501 --> 59:32.098
Why are we his sports club.

59:32.100 --> 59:33.819
I mean, where's Lee?

59:33.821 --> 59:35.658
Shouldn't he be here
supporting his buddy?

59:35.660 --> 59:48.378
Ohh, Lee won't be going
anywhere for quite a while.

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:04.179
So what
did you do to his car?

01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:05.499
Nothing.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.379
That's the beauty of
it, I didn't have to.

01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:09.458
He'll be worried
about it for days.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.219
That is pure evil.

01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:13.698
Psychological warfare
is just the best.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.819
I've literally never
been prouder of you.

01:00:18.821 --> 01:00:21.058
No!

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.338
Attack!

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.738
Good spotting, lads!

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.939
Way to do that thing, you did.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.061
Hey, yah.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.738
Hello my knight in
baby blue armor.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.578
So did you get
lots of touchdowns.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.979
I play defense.

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:39.059
Okay, so did you
get lots of defense?

01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:41.138
Sure yeah, I guess.

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:42.979
You know it's a good
thing you're eloquent and

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:47.421
charming, because honestly
this bores the hell out of me.

01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:50.538
You're bored?

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.938
But it's worth it for
someone that sends beautiful

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.258
texts all day.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.581
I'm still texting you?

01:00:55.301 --> 01:00:56.299
What do you mean?

01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:59.219
Uh, no.
I was, was agreeing.

01:00:59.221 --> 01:01:00.861
I am still texting you.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.059
Yeah, sometimes 30 poems a day.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.859
Want to go?

01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.058
Yes.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.379
Alright.

01:01:08.381 --> 01:01:09.419
Wait up?

01:01:09.421 --> 01:01:11.659
What if I wasn't eloquent?

01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:12.658
But you are.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.698
It's the thing I
love most about you.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:18.099
All those other girls like
you because of how you look.

01:01:18.101 --> 01:01:20.259
But I love you
because of how you are.

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:22.421
What if I had a weird
face or something?

01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:25.821
Then I'd love him even more.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.099
Have fun, defensing.
Oh, and if you look up

01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:31.941
and see me reading a
book, don't be offended.

01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:34.861
I still love you.

01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:43.379
Hey ahh, Bronwyn
and I are heading out,

01:01:43.381 --> 01:01:45.021
so I'll catch you later.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.499
I'm such an idiot.

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:52.058
You referring to something
that happened in the field,

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.498
'cause I wasn't really
paying attention.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.140
You love her.

01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:58.859
Roxy.

01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:00.301
You love her.

01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:05.379
Well yeah, we've been
friends since we were kids,

01:02:05.381 --> 01:02:06.619
but it's not like that.

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:08.819
Is that why you're still sending
her thirty text messages a day?

01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:09.858
I'm helping you out.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.099
No I've read what
you write to her.

01:02:12.101 --> 01:02:13.658
I should have seen it.
It's as plain as the nose...

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.178
My God!
I always say the wrong thing.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.299
No look, honestly I'd I don't...

01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:22.819
She said she would love
me no matter how I looked.

01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:25.258
What?

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.339
She loves you.

01:02:27.341 --> 01:02:29.739
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:02:29.741 --> 01:02:31.059
But you love her.

01:02:31.061 --> 01:02:34.579
Yeah. I do, I mean,
but I want her

01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:37.538
to love me for who I am
otherwise what's the point.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.419
I mean I've been out here
busting my ass for the last

01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:42.178
45 minutes and she doesn't care.
This is who I am.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.858
This is what I do, while she
sits up there daydreaming about

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.498
the guy wrote her those texts.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.541
You love her, don't you?

01:02:54.581 --> 01:02:55.859
More than anything.

01:02:55.861 --> 01:02:57.178
You got to tell her, man.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.020
No, no. I can't.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:06.339
If you love her, you'll
give her the choice.

01:03:06.341 --> 01:03:10.699
Tell her.

01:03:10.701 --> 01:03:14.178
Are we going or what?

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.458
I'll catch up.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.701
Okay, we'll see...

01:03:22.181 --> 01:03:25.659
Are you gonna tell her?

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.180
Holy shit!

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.178
I love football!

01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:40.498
I give up.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.499
Oh hi.
You're running awfully late.

01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:43.418
Car trouble?

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.820
I don't know. You tell me.

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:47.659
Well you seem to have gotten
here in one piece anyway.

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:49.258
I took a bus.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.019
Did you know that the number
three goes all the way around

01:03:51.021 --> 01:03:52.738
Molson Lake and through
Barretville before getting here.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.898
Because it does.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.698
Ah, number seven would
have brought you right

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.138
here in ten minutes.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.659
That's not the point.

01:03:58.661 --> 01:04:01.459
I just spent two hours wondering
if you cut my brake line.

01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:04.219
Really?
Jeez, Lee I'm not a psycho.

01:04:04.221 --> 01:04:05.261
Aren't you?

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.338
Look, I don't know how this
thing started or even why...

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.699
Seriously?
You have no idea.

01:04:10.701 --> 01:04:12.021
No, I don't!

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.061
So we should go hang out and
make fun of roller skaters.

01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:19.938
That doesn't sound familiar?

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.939
Oh.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:23.658
Two hours in a rollercade.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.018
No one to hear my
witty put downs.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.500
It was humiliating.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.941
Wait, was that a date?

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.618
There is literally no other
reason why I would set foot

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.219
in a rollercade.

01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:36.381
I didn't know. I thought
it was like a hang out thing.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.820
Your car is fine.

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.379
Good bye, Lee.

01:04:42.381 --> 01:04:44.180
Oh no, wait.
I'm sorry, OK.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.740
Scram!

01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:54.258
Thank God you decided to stay.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:58.099
This is really boring.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.301
Then why are you here?

01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:03.221
It's cause all
those stupid texts.

01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:07.541
They're so sweet
and beautiful and amazing.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:15.498
Every time I get one I
just want to be near him.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.699
He said that...

01:05:16.701 --> 01:05:21.179
you said even if he was ugly
that you'd still like him.

01:05:21.181 --> 01:05:22.618
Is that true?

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.820
Yeah. Of course.

01:05:28.301 --> 01:05:32.739
What if he was like, grotesque?

01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:39.418
He could look like
Quasimodo for all I care.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.621
I have something to tell you.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.298
Yeah?

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.699
Well, it's kinda hard.

01:05:46.701 --> 01:05:48.658
Hey, it's me.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.420
You can tell me anything.

01:05:55.021 --> 01:05:57.941
Well Rox, the thing is...

01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.980
Playing the outside.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.300
Oooohhhh!

01:06:07.021 --> 01:06:08.858
Back up, back up.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.739
Christian!

01:06:09.741 --> 01:06:11.099
Call 911.

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:12.938
Christian, can you hear me?

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.138
I can't move.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:18.178
It's gonna be okay, son.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.741
Help's on the way.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.739
It's going to be okay.

01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:23.778
Christian.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.740
Yes, Cyrus.

01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:28.541
She picked you.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.298
Back up guys.
Give him some room.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.099
It's going to be okay Christian.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.419
Okay, so what's the
situation at the hospital?

01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:45.980
Is Christian gonna be okay?

01:06:47.661 --> 01:06:49.659
Broken arm and
a sprained back.

01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:51.619
Doctor says he'll be
back home in a week.

01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:53.459
That's good, maybe Coach
Harris will stop muttering in

01:06:53.461 --> 01:06:55.898
gym class about losing
all his defensemen, now.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.339
Okay, so explain to me why, on
top of getting Roxy to fall in

01:06:59.341 --> 01:07:02.498
love with another guy, you
didn't tell her the truth, even

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.338
though you were given an open
invitation by that other guy?

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.858
How could I?

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.019
And then to top it all off, you
lied about telling her to the

01:07:09.021 --> 01:07:11.819
guy who told you to tell her
before he got carried off the

01:07:11.821 --> 01:07:13.498
field in a stretcher?

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.699
You know when
you put it like that,

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.098
you make it sound pretty awful.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.058
It is awful on every
conceivable level.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:18.858
What else could it be?

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.258
I don't know. Noble?

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.219
You know, for someone who's
supposed to be super smart,

01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:23.499
you're kinda stupid.

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:25.139
That's fair.

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.178
Well I'm glad
Christian is okay.

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.378
Yeah, yeah.
It could've been a lot worse.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.179
He could've taken a
head shot!

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:32.658
Oh! How are you doing that?

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.818
Well, see this button here.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.498
It let's me shoot things and
I press it when I see you.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.699
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:39.058
Do you have any plans
to go into acting?

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.499
No, why?

01:07:40.501 --> 01:07:42.259
I just though it you were, you
could use a little help with

01:07:42.261 --> 01:07:43.579
your head shot!

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:44.381
Argh!

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.338
Get out of my respawn area,
you cherry picker.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.260
All right, all right.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:49.938
Ah haa!

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.138
You're shooting
a garbage can.

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.740
Dammit! Where are you?

01:07:54.301 --> 01:07:55.379
Look up.

01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:56.698
Where? By the bridge?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.660
Look at me. I'll draw
you a map of my location.

01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:08.858
You know, I used to like
this game and now you've

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.259
sucked all the
fun out of it.

01:08:10.261 --> 01:08:11.538
Do you want to play
something else?

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.979
No, I gotta go.

01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:14.418
Daycare of Doom is playing
at the Republik tonight.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.419
They play Thrash Metal on
Fisher Price instruments.

01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:18.858
It's amazeballs.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.819
Your parents know you're
going to a bar gig underage?

01:08:20.821 --> 01:08:24.381
Yes, because I don't lie
to the people that I love.

01:08:25.381 --> 01:08:26.938
Head shot!

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.139
Ouch.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.220
Mic drop.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.578
I'll see you Monday.

01:08:32.581 --> 01:08:34.220
Alright. See ya.

01:08:45.301 --> 01:08:47.377
He just
sent me this text.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.379
"I think we should break up.

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:53.379
It's for the best.

01:08:53.381 --> 01:08:55.139
CU."

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.541
Letter C, letter U.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.139
Did you talk to him at all?

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.301
I tried, but he
won't let me see him.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.819
Told me to stay away.

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.059
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, just,

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.497
I always run to you to solve
my problems and it's not fair.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.819
No, I'm sure that
if I talk to him...

01:09:11.821 --> 01:09:13.261
Just talk just talk to me.

01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:15.859
That's all I want right now.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.620
Okay.

01:09:24.781 --> 01:09:26.661
To be broken
up with like that,

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.180
especially after he
was was so articulate.

01:09:32.381 --> 01:09:33.901
It just doesn't make any sense.

01:09:36.541 --> 01:09:38.220
Love rarely does.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:43.377
I just read too many
romantic stories.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.420
I keep looking for
Heathcliff and Mr. Darcy.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:52.179
My standards are just
too high, I guess.

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:55.021
I know a lot of people who
need to lower their standards.

01:09:55.821 --> 01:10:00.259
You are not one of them.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.421
Thank you.

01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:12.659
I should-I have to study.
If I don't get into the same

01:10:12.661 --> 01:10:15.941
college as my sister, my parents
will probably lose their minds.

01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.179
Ah yeah, yeah.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:22.378
Um I should get going anyway.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.258
Okay.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.901
You going to be okay?

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:31.498
No, but I will be.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.540
Thank you.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.139
Hey I was talking
to Bronwyn and-

01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:45.219
if you need some help studying,
I'll be here.

01:10:45.221 --> 01:10:46.819
I'll be fine I'll be fine.

01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:49.698
I won't tell anyone.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.380
I'm just, look, I
get it sorted out.

01:10:53.341 --> 01:10:56.099
I'm a little behind,
but it's okay.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.020
Okay well, I'm here
if you need me.

01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:17.179
What the hell!?

01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:18.538
Whoa!

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.620
You're right, that-
that was rude.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.939
How are you feeling?

01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:25.099
Better.

01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:26.979
The doctor said I
should be able...

01:11:26.981 --> 01:11:28.979
Dude! What the hell!

01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:30.099
I know you didn't tell her.

01:11:30.101 --> 01:11:32.939
No. I told you not to
let her down, Christian.

01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:35.259
I specifically said
those exact words.

01:11:35.261 --> 01:11:37.298
Yeah, I know.
That's why did it.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.019
She's never going
to be happy with me.

01:11:39.021 --> 01:11:42.541
Dude seriously, I feel
nothing but relief right now.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.018
Well, I mean
agonizing back pain too,

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.819
but they give me stuff for that.

01:11:46.821 --> 01:11:47.901
Good stuff?

01:11:48.461 --> 01:11:50.618
Awesome stuff.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.058
At least let me
write the goodbye.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.938
To give her some closure.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.138
Sure. Yeah,
that would be great.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.659
Alright. Take it easy, man.

01:11:59.661 --> 01:12:01.301
Are you going to tell her?

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.899
It's complicated.

01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:05.218
No, man.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.538
It really isn't, but hey
you know, it's your call.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.260
She's not going to
hear anything from me.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.180
Alright.

01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:18.298
Ahhh, awesome huggage Dude!

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.859
Ahh, yeah.
Tell anyone I hugged you

01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:21.259
and I'll screw your
student loan for life.

01:12:21.261 --> 01:12:23.021
I got it.
I'll see you around.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.499
Tell her!

01:12:43.821 --> 01:12:45.539
My dear Roxanne.

01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:47.979
I'd like to apologies
for my abrupt goodbye.

01:12:47.981 --> 01:12:50.539
I was working under the
ancient Greek ideal that

01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:53.219
"Integrity is to be
preferred to eloquence."

01:12:53.221 --> 01:12:55.138
I didn't realize how
that would hurt you.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.378
I never meant to do that.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.178
Roxy, you'll be graduating soon
and you'll go to some far off

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.339
university on your way
to a bright future.

01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:05.019
I'm not even sure where I'll be
and I couldn't live with myself

01:13:05.021 --> 01:13:07.619
if I knew that I held
you back in any way.

01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:10.818
Seems that you and I were
a dream and now we're both

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.499
waking up, finding ourselves
on diverging paths.

01:13:14.501 --> 01:13:15.859
Not meant to be.

01:13:15.861 --> 01:13:18.701
As much as I need you I
need you to be happy more.

01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:22.299
So it's with the heaviest
heart I must say goodbye.

01:13:22.301 --> 01:13:25.339
Please respect this sacrifice
by not pursuing it further.

01:13:25.341 --> 01:13:27.219
Pursue your dreams instead.

01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:30.778
Inspire others with your
kindness and passion

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.418
the way you've inspired me.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:35.658
And know that I'll always love
you, even if it's from afar.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.818
I remain yours always.

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:48.100
Christian.

01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:56.021
Hey gorgeous.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.018
I thought Tony Campbell
was supposed to be my

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.379
lab partner this week.

01:14:00.381 --> 01:14:02.658
Yeah, I gave him a little
something for the switch.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.218
Thought you might be lonely
now that Newville dumped you.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.738
I'm lonely.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.978
Okay well, if I must be
partnered with a caveman,

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.458
the least you can
do is light a fire.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.138
I'll do whatever you want.

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.859
You know, I light
fires all the time.

01:14:14.861 --> 01:14:16.699
My dad's got a
condo by the lake.

01:14:16.701 --> 01:14:17.859
Huge fire pit.

01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:19.778
You should come up this weekend.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.578
You punched my best
friend in the face.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.658
Yeah. Good times.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.899
You know we can talk more
about that this weekend.

01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:27.099
It's not happening.

01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:29.498
I'm totally free this weekend.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.939
Okay, just mix 200 mils of
this and 100 mils of that.

01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:34.701
Ahmm, and I'll take notes.

01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:38.179
So ahh, what has
Newville got that I don't?

01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:41.099
Class, intelligence,
passion, eloquence.

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:45.858
More than just eloquence,
he has integrity

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.938
and sometimes integrity is
to be preferred to eloquence.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.138
Yeah, he said that.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.499
Christian?

01:14:51.501 --> 01:14:53.538
No. Your buddy, Schnozz.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.458
Cyrus said that?

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.739
Yeah. He says shit
like that all the time.

01:14:56.741 --> 01:14:59.779
That's why he gets punched in
the face on people's lawns.

01:14:59.781 --> 01:15:02.261
I am totally okay with
you punching people.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.778
This is turning blue.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.578
Is it supposed to turn blue?

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.100
Write down blue.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.739
Hey!

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.981
Hey!
Bad day to be you, Bro.

01:15:29.221 --> 01:15:30.339
Let's move him.

01:15:30.341 --> 01:15:31.861
Quick, quick, go, go, go.

01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:50.018
How are you feeling
now, Dick nose?

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:50.940
Beep, beep.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.858
So, thought it would be funny

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.819
to get me kicked off the
football team, huh?

01:15:55.821 --> 01:15:57.899
Embarrass me in front
of the whole school.

01:16:01.301 --> 01:16:04.299
You kicking the shit out of me,

01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:05.818
I still think it's funny.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.980
So it must be pretty funny.

01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:10.981
Pick him up.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.380
Wait, wait, wait.
Before-

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.098
Before you commit
your latest atrocity I want

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.061
you to know something.

01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:27.221
When I graduate I'm going
to find a software company

01:16:27.781 --> 01:16:30.621
and you're going to go into your
vibrant career as a gas jockey.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.338
And when that happens, I'm gonna
pull up in some stupid expensive

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.221
car and tell you to clean
the bugs off my windshield.

01:16:40.741 --> 01:16:42.259
And you're gonna do it.

01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:44.699
This is as good as your
life is ever going to get.

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:48.099
You greasy mouth
breathing troll.

01:16:48.101 --> 01:16:50.299
Go on. Do it!

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.219
Do your worst!

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.061
Oh shit.

01:17:00.341 --> 01:17:02.341
I think you might
have killed him, Mike.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.778
Hi Mrs. Nolan.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.619
Oh hey Sweetie.
Cyrus isn't home yet,

01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:14.339
but he should be soon.
Come on it.

01:17:14.341 --> 01:17:15.580
Okay, thanks.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.498
Ahh, ohh, I, I can't stay.
I have to study.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.178
Uhm, I just loaned Cyrus some
of my notes and I was just

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.298
wondering if I could go
in and get them back.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.938
Sure. Good luck finding
anything in that rat's nest.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:42.779
Thank you so much.

01:18:10.061 --> 01:18:12.259
My dearest Roxanne.

01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:15.221
First I must apologize
for my abrupt goodbye.

01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:18.498
That jerk!!

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.541
Everything okay down there?

01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:23.461
Yeah, I'm fine thank you.

01:18:33.421 --> 01:18:35.338
Did you find what
you're looking for?

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.179
Yeah, I certainly did.
Thank you, goodnight.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:39.101
Wait.

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.740
I have cookies.

01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:45.219
OK.
Thank you.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.258
Bye Sweetie.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:57.419
Bye.

01:19:01.661 --> 01:19:03.979
Hello.

01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:05.621
Yes this is she.

01:19:07.941 --> 01:19:08.741
Oh.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.860
Oh my god.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.818
Is he okay?

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.579
Is he awake?
Is he conscious?

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.179
Don't say anything.
It's okay.

01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:42.619
You just rest.
I'm here now.

01:19:42.621 --> 01:19:46.498
You scared the shit out of me
you jerk faced, weasel jerk.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.138
Bronwyn, please.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.058
Well he scared the
shit out of me.

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.819
Yes I know.
Go wait outside.

01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.298
Stop scaring the shit out of me.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.819
Bronwyn. He knows.

01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:58.501
Go to the cafeteria.
I will meet you there.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.418
If you die-

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:05.458
I will kill you.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.458
Your cousin loves
you very much.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.819
I can see that.

01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:13.179
Do you need anything?

01:20:13.181 --> 01:20:14.701
Yeah.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.940
Who are you?

01:20:17.861 --> 01:20:19.338
Oh, I'm kidding mom.

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.060
That was not funny.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.179
The doctor says you
just need to rest.

01:20:25.181 --> 01:20:27.659
You have a very bad concussion.

01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:29.738
It's very important
that you stay in bed.

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.858
Can I have my laptop?

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.740
No, you can't.

01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:35.898
Now your cousin and I have been
here since last night so we're

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:39.101
going to go, get a bite to eat,
but I'll be right back, okay.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.179
What day is it?

01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:42.739
Cyrus.

01:20:42.741 --> 01:20:45.179
No, I actually don't
know what day it is.

01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:48.978
- It's Friday, around 5:30.
- 5:30?

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.541
They brought
you in yesterday.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.378
The police said they
wanted to talk to you,

01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.220
but I told them
not until tomorrow.

01:20:56.461 --> 01:20:57.341
Okay.

01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.820
I'll be back soon.

01:21:00.861 --> 01:21:02.341
My poor boy.

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.219
You really did scare
the shit out of us.

01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:12.861
I know.
I'm sorry.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.900
You're late.

01:21:39.341 --> 01:21:41.501
Oh! What happened to your face?

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.299
I was born with this nose.

01:21:43.301 --> 01:21:44.858
No.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.299
Oh, oh, ahh, ahh,
skateboard thing.

01:21:47.301 --> 01:21:49.578
I told you that
thing will kill you.

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.100
This time you might be right.

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.298
I could use a coffee.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.698
I already got you one.

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.299
Oh, yeah, good.

01:21:57.301 --> 01:21:59.218
So, hows the Hemingway book?

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:02.939
Lots of moping and lunches
and bull fights I suppose?

01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:05.458
Two people who are supposed to
love each other lying all the

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.980
time is not really
my cup of tea.

01:22:08.981 --> 01:22:10.139
I don't want tea.

01:22:10.141 --> 01:22:11.899
I want coffee.
I'm going to go get some.

01:22:11.901 --> 01:22:13.061
Wait, Cyrus.

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.779
Oh. Coffee.
What did I order?

01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:18.059
You didn't.

01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:19.418
Are you okay?

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.298
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.899
All night study
session last night.

01:22:22.901 --> 01:22:26.019
Ahh, tried to call you and tell
you I was going to be late.

01:22:26.021 --> 01:22:29.738
Um, my phone has been
acting a little weird lately.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.578
I haven't been getting messages.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.299
Which is a pain you know,
because open communication

01:22:34.301 --> 01:22:37.058
between friends is
really important.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.020
Let me see.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.059
Thank you.

01:22:41.061 --> 01:22:42.658
Yeah, no problem.

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.298
You can just buy
me a cup of coffee.

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:45.338
Another one?

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.580
Hmm, Oh coffee, good.
That will help.

01:22:48.461 --> 01:22:49.581
So what's new?

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:53.380
I saw Christian the other day.

01:22:54.501 --> 01:22:56.339
He just pretended
I wasn't there.

01:22:56.341 --> 01:22:59.018
You know I thought he
was the love of my life.

01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.219
It was weird.

01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:03.139
It felt like sometimes I
was two different people.

01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:05.019
Those were some
heavy duty letters.

01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:06.659
Yeah, you wouldn't think a
guy like him could write

01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:07.978
so beautifully.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.858
"You're like a rose pressed
between pages in an old

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.938
book of romantic poetry.

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:18.818
A startling beauty surrounded
and nourished by words of love."

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.818
How did you remember that.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.059
He told me about it.

01:23:22.061 --> 01:23:23.618
Yeah, but that
was word for word.

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:27.099
Three minutes ago you couldn't
remember you already had coffee.

01:23:27.101 --> 01:23:28.658
Yeah, I'd love one.
Thank you.

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.101
Cyrus, what's going on?

01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.141
I don't know.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.898
Maybe it's in your settings.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.139
Technology is a funny thing.

01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:39.978
Feel closer to you
than I've ever been,

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.179
but still so isolated.

01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:44.259
What was that?

01:23:44.261 --> 01:23:52.059
Maybe it's in your settings?

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:53.300
Read this.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.500
Okay.

01:23:58.141 --> 01:24:01.979
Out loud.

01:24:01.981 --> 01:24:03.781
"Pursue your dreams instead.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.101
Inspire others with
kindness and generosity

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.300
the way you inspired me."

01:24:15.661 --> 01:24:17.458
I know it was you.

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.818
Yes.
No, no, no.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.218
Possibly.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.818
The letters, the emails, the
messages, it was all you.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:25.858
Why?

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.819
He loved you.

01:24:26.821 --> 01:24:28.540
Who exactly did I love?

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.739
I thought you were
my best friend, Cyrus,

01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:34.018
but apparently that doesn't
make me immune to your stupid

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.018
little pranks now does it?

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.099
That's not what happened.

01:24:37.101 --> 01:24:39.178
Did he pay you? How much our
friendship worth, Cyrus?

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.978
Okay. Don't get
self-righteous with me.

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.539
You already were
in love with him.

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.778
You think you're so
above being shallow.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.258
Yeah I want a man with, with
the great soul, but you better

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.619
have washboard
abs to go with it.

01:24:49.621 --> 01:24:50.938
Oh!

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.379
You're just like every other
girl, you just have more

01:24:52.381 --> 01:24:53.618
pretentious quotes in
your Pinterest page.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.498
You manipulated me.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.859
You believed it, because
you wanted to believe it.

01:24:57.861 --> 01:24:59.938
No, I believed it because no
sane person would even think of

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.098
doing something like this.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.098
You asked me to
talk him for you.

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.258
I just gave him a little nudge.

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.581
Yeah, I loved you.

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.620
Him. I loved him.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.738
Whatever, that was
unbelievably cruel.

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.859
Okay, come off of it.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.498
You live in this perfect
little bubble that everyone

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:21.178
who happens to be good
looking gets to live in.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.659
And you have no idea how
the real world works.

01:25:22.661 --> 01:25:25.178
Oh god. Please don't tell
me this is about your nose.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:27.659
Let me tell you something
about your nose, Cyrus.

01:25:27.661 --> 01:25:28.898
You love that nose.
It lets you get away with

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:30.821
the giant chip
that's on your shoulder.

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.139
I never meant to hurt you.

01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:38.979
What did you mean to do?

01:25:38.981 --> 01:25:40.421
I fixed your phone.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.339
Remember that guy that sent
you a dick pic and I got him

01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:46.019
kicked off the football team.

01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:47.821
He remembers too.

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.978
Oh my god.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.018
Am I in a coffee shop?
Because what does a guy

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.100
have to do to get a cup
of coffee around here.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.818
Oh my god.
Oh my god! Okay.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.498
Hey, just don't move, okay.
Just be...

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.578
Can someone call 911?

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.659
This is great.

01:26:02.661 --> 01:26:05.499
I need to go, though.
Next Friday?

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:07.418
Oh my god.

01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:22.779
Hey.

01:26:22.781 --> 01:26:23.900
Hey.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.298
How are you feeling?

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.899
Well, I'm awake, so that's a
good start, I guess.

01:26:34.901 --> 01:26:36.181
I'm glad.

01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:43.859
I uhmm,

01:26:43.861 --> 01:26:45.781
I have something
I need to tell you.

01:26:47.741 --> 01:26:48.620
Okay.

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.540
You're not going
to see me for awhile.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:57.099
Yeah, I know you, your parents
are going to look at colleges.

01:26:57.101 --> 01:27:00.459
No, I mean after that.

01:27:00.461 --> 01:27:03.099
For how long?

01:27:03.101 --> 01:27:04.620
I don't know.

01:27:06.901 --> 01:27:08.061
What, like forever?

01:27:10.621 --> 01:27:14.658
I know I screwed up but,
if you can forgive me...

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.419
That's the problem, Cyrus,
is that I probably will.

01:27:18.421 --> 01:27:20.461
And then you'll go back to
pulling stuff like this.

01:27:22.141 --> 01:27:23.498
You should use your
talent to help people,

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.419
not manipulate them.

01:27:25.421 --> 01:27:26.698
I know I...

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.699
I know it was over the line...

01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:31.101
Just forget about
that whole disaster.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.581
Look at you.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.661
You almost died because of
a stunt you pulled for me.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.259
I just don't think that
hanging around each other

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:46.461
is such a good idea.

01:27:50.421 --> 01:27:52.260
I'm glad you're okay.

01:28:00.421 --> 01:28:02.301
Can you do me a favor?

01:28:03.941 --> 01:28:06.498
Anything.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.138
Get your grades back up.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.620
Go to a good school.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:14.101
Just focus on
you for a while okay?

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.139
Have a good life, Cyrus.

01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:20.581
I was trying to help.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:31.458
Please stop calling me.

01:29:29.021 --> 01:29:29.820
Hey.

01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:33.701
So, what was so important you
couldn't tell me in a text.

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:46.498
You texted me.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.460
Well...

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.899
we can't make
fun of these people.

01:29:50.901 --> 01:29:53.058
They're skating for charity.

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.378
Well, I mean, if
we agree to make a sizable

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.858
donation to that charity.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.218
Agreed.
Let's start with that guy.

01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.860
I'm going to call him Mr. Jorts.

01:30:02.581 --> 01:30:05.298
Agent Jorts.
Secret agent on wheels.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:28.618
His arch enemy, Pot Hole.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.259
You know what? Let me
take that bag cause I think

01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:33.461
somebody left something
in the back yard for you.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:47.938
Okay.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.939
Hi Roxy.

01:31:30.941 --> 01:31:33.658
You know this is literally
the first time since I was

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.740
ten that I've allowed
a video or photo of me.

01:31:37.221 --> 01:31:40.261
You've always seen past my
nose and it's time I did too.

01:31:41.421 --> 01:31:44.258
I'm so sorry.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.939
I will never lie to
you again, I swear.

01:31:46.941 --> 01:31:49.658
Every once in a while I will go
to the skate park and see a guy

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.979
with his arm around a girl
and get this wave of romantic

01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:57.098
feelings and think, why not me?

01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.619
So I'll rush home and
change my shirt and check

01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:00.860
myself in the mirror.

01:32:02.221 --> 01:32:04.341
Tell myself today is
day that I'm gonna do it.

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.020
And then all I see is this.

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:12.260
I remember why I don't
allow a picture to be taken.

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:18.219
But this time I'm
not backing down.

01:32:18.221 --> 01:32:19.701
So here goes.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.738
I love you.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:23.939
Yeah, yeah, I know,
you love me too.

01:32:23.941 --> 01:32:25.059
We're good friends.

01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:28.498
But I love you.

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.580
Love you in the Princess
Bride sense of the word.

01:32:32.781 --> 01:32:36.218
In a "I would bring down
the stars and make a garden

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.139
for you to read in"
sense of the word.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:44.858
Even if we never speak again,
I needed you to know that.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.700
So enjoy your epic blanket fort.

01:32:48.781 --> 01:32:53.579
You deserve it all, Roxy.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.499
I'm offering you two sheep.

01:33:38.501 --> 01:33:40.658
Two. For one stinking piece
of oar. Don't be a jerk.

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.618
You already have the
longest road. I'm not going to

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.978
give you oar so you can start
building cities, willie nilly.

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.778
Willie nilly? Really?
Is that something that

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.658
people who aren't in a
retirement home say?

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.058
Willie Nilly is
making a comeback.

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.378
Willie Nilly is going
to be the name of my band.

01:33:54.501 --> 01:33:55.858
Two sheep and a wheat.
Final offer.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.618
No, forget it. You
get nothing. How's that, jerk.

01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:00.779
Cyrus, how about you.
Two sheep for one oar?

01:34:00.781 --> 01:34:03.780
A simple no would have
been fine, drama queen.

01:34:05.461 --> 01:34:07.060
Wanna make out?

01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:26.459
I'm realizing now there are
only three words of all the

01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:28.701
words written in all the
books in all the world.

01:34:30.221 --> 01:34:32.301
The only words that
matter are "I love you."

01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:35.819
Your words, Cyrus.

01:34:35.821 --> 01:34:37.501
Not his.

01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:40.021
You memorized that way
better than he did.

01:34:40.701 --> 01:34:42.538
Took days.

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.180
You lied to me.

01:34:44.821 --> 01:34:47.259
Deliberately
manipulated my feelings.

01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:49.420
I know, I know.
I'm so sorry.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:53.938
I just wanted you to be happy.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:58.220
Well that guy
who wrote those texts,

01:35:00.661 --> 01:35:06.779
I loved his soul,
his wit, his passion.

01:35:06.781 --> 01:35:07.861
That was you.

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.259
Was it all a lie?

01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:13.419
No.

01:35:13.421 --> 01:35:14.781
No not at all.

01:35:15.661 --> 01:35:17.499
I had to get it off my chest.

01:35:17.501 --> 01:35:21.378
I thought even if I, even
if I wasn't the guy for you

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.260
that I could feel what it
would be like to be with you.

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.498
Even with this giant
thing on my face...

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.098
Cyrus. It's just a nose.

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.699
To you.

01:35:30.701 --> 01:35:32.779
To me it was a wall.

01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:34.338
A giant boulder blocking
the gateway to everything

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.580
that I ever wanted.

01:35:36.381 --> 01:35:38.819
Which is?

01:35:38.821 --> 01:35:39.821
You.

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.340
Just, just you.

01:35:45.301 --> 01:35:46.618
It's always been you.

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:50.018
I want to hear you say it
in person. Don't make a joke.

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:52.220
Don't make an
excuse, just tell me.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.258
Did you mean what you sent me?

01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.660
Every word.

01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:03.661
You must be freezing.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.380
No.

01:36:08.861 --> 01:36:10.421
That's not why I'm shivering.

01:36:34.501 --> 01:36:35.858
Oh, no, no.

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.781
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You're my guy now.

01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:44.939
Wooo yeah!

01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:47.338
Oh my god!

01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.700
All wet over again.

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.139
You're soaked!

01:36:51.141 --> 01:36:52.661
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:19.498
Oww! Mother...

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.299
Jake...

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.258
Yeah?

01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.300
Oops.

01:37:29.021 --> 01:37:30.099
Aghhh!

01:37:30.101 --> 01:37:31.021
Oh god!

01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:40.381
Get out.

01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:47.298
I, I, sorry.

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.460
I had a hair in my mouth.

01:37:52.061 --> 01:37:54.098
So I'm all yeah right
and she's all like no.

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.939
So I put down the skirt I was
going to buy which was super

01:37:56.941 --> 01:38:00.779
cute, BT dub and I text her
yeah, and she was like, uhm, no.

01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:03.499
And I was like, uhm, yeah.

01:38:03.501 --> 01:38:05.538
And then she says
no and I'm like...

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.140
Hold on.

01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.298
Oh, hell yeah.

01:38:42.941 --> 01:38:45.501
Kind of like Arnold,
"Shut up you idiot."

01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.861
Aghhh.
