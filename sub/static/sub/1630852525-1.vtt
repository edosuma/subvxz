00:14.681 --> 00:15.815
- Blood pressure's dropping.

00:15.882 --> 00:16.850
- We're gonna lose her.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.889
- Damn it, she's flatlining.

00:22.989 --> 00:26.159
- Come on, breathe.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.261
Come on, breathe!

00:28.361 --> 00:29.496
Nothing?

00:39.372 --> 00:44.244
- Time of death, 2:37 a.m.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.713
Christmas Day.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.133
I died!

01:07.233 --> 01:08.701
I was dead!

01:10.470 --> 01:14.808
I saw everything! I saw everything!

01:16.242 --> 01:18.311
- How you feeling?

01:18.411 --> 01:21.448
You were dead for 37 seconds, you know.

01:25.652 --> 01:29.923
- I've never felt better.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.435
- She's just walking-- - Dory!

01:42.502 --> 01:44.170
- Dory! - Where is room 221?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.672
We don't have time to look ourselves.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.007
- Excuse me, you all need to take it down a notch.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.009
It's the holidays. People are trying to die.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.744
- Oh, my God, there she is.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.279
- Oh, my God. She looks awful.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.448
- Are you her family?

01:55.515 --> 01:57.350
- Yeah, we're all married to her.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.652
Excuse me. - Excuse us.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.856
- Sorry, we're--

02:02.956 --> 02:04.324
- Hi, Dory.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.459
- Hi. - Hi...

02:06.526 --> 02:08.361
- Hi, guys. - Honey, hi!

02:08.461 --> 02:10.697
Oh, sweetie, we came as almost as soon as we heard.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.866
How are you doing? Are you okay?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.035
- I died.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.637
- No.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.673
- I died. It sounds so funny.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.176
I mean, I just can't believe it.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.444
- Do you mean dead like when people say

02:24.511 --> 02:25.712
"Okay, I'm literally dead"

02:25.812 --> 02:27.480
or dead like you're literally dead?

02:27.547 --> 02:30.550
- No, Elliott, I was dead.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.118
37 seconds!

02:32.185 --> 02:34.187
It's on my chart.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.655
But I'm so happy.

02:35.722 --> 02:39.359
I mean I'm just so hopeful, you know.

02:39.459 --> 02:43.329
It's like a huge well of joy

02:43.396 --> 02:47.734
just--just bubbling up from within me, you know.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.303
It's love. It's love.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.740
Oh, and...

02:53.840 --> 02:56.309
it is infinite,

02:56.376 --> 02:59.746
but at the same time, there is no time.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.916
You know, I can see the way you guys see me.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.719
And it's so--it's so funny,

03:06.819 --> 03:09.088
but it's all so true.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.590
- Wow. - Hmm.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.425
- Cool. What did you see?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.861
- I saw you.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.996
Like, all of you.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.565
And you were there, and you were there,

03:18.665 --> 03:21.034
and you were there!

03:21.100 --> 03:23.436
You were at my funeral.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.905
And I was watching you.

03:26.839 --> 03:32.078
You were all there for me. Oh, it was so intense.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.383
- Well, that sounds like a really cool dream, Dory.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.786
- It really wasn't a dream, Drew.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.020
It was real. - All right.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.690
- You were really there.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.592
I mean, it was like an alternate universe

03:45.692 --> 03:48.928
where I--I--like, I stayed dead, you know.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.130
And I almost stayed there.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.634
But then I got a message,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.302
but it wasn't in words.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.771
It was beyond that.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.041
I was being combined, you know.

04:02.108 --> 04:05.945
It was like all of my sides,

04:06.045 --> 04:07.947
like the different mes.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.450
Just...

04:10.550 --> 04:13.052
Like, I was just connecting things, you know.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.921
Just, like, at, like, a million miles per hour, you know.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.056
It was like past, present, future, love, love, love, time,

04:17.123 --> 04:19.225
time, time, love, feature, time flying, fine,

04:19.292 --> 04:21.094
fine, time, time. Love, love,

04:21.160 --> 04:23.263
everyone, everyone, everyone, love, time, time.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.598
And then,

04:25.665 --> 04:29.102
all of a sudden I was told to go back,

04:29.168 --> 04:31.104
because I had more work to do here.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.272
- Wow, yeah. - Mm.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.074
- And work is amazing.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.577
Do you think you'll apply for jobs or?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.145
- No, I need you all-- come here.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.346
Come here.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.349
- Okay, honey.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.586
- I need y'all to really hear me.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.354
Life...

04:48.454 --> 04:51.524
is so beautiful.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.860
I mean, oh, my God.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.796
You know, just like what a gift.

04:56.863 --> 05:00.933
I'm just so grateful. We're alive.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.469
We are all alive.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.371
- Mm... - Yeah.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.773
That's--I never thought of it that way.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.007
That's insane. - Yeah.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.642
Well, we should probably go

05:09.709 --> 05:12.445
talk to the doctor and just check in and see

05:12.512 --> 05:14.347
when we can get you out of here.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.615
- Okay. - Yeah.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.050
I'm gonna see also if we can get you

05:17.150 --> 05:19.552
a little water for your dry little face.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.721
- - All right, girly girl.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.156
Mwah. - Bye.

05:23.222 --> 05:27.026
- Bye. -

05:27.126 --> 05:28.861
- I do not wanna go back in there.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.798
Life is beautiful? Like, no, it's not.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.466
Look at how ugly everyone here is.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.903
- She died and imagined her own funeral.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.039
It's like a level of narcissism that none of us can relate to.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.842
- But I don't think that's just narcissism.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.544
I can be friends with a dead narcissist.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.580
I cannot be friends with that. - 100%.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.148
- You guys, I think that we have

05:49.215 --> 05:51.084
to think about this responsibly, all right?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.854
I don't know if we can give her the type of help she needs.

05:54.921 --> 05:58.424
Maybe we should actually commit her.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.093
- What?

06:00.193 --> 06:01.594
Commit her to, like, a loony bin?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.029
- If that's not what crazy looks like,

06:03.096 --> 06:04.430
I don't know what is.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.899
Maybe she just finally snapped.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.668
- You know, I hate agreeing with you, Drew,

06:08.735 --> 06:10.870
but I think honestly, you might be right.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.372
- I don't know if you guys remember,

06:12.438 --> 06:14.874
but I was committed once

06:14.941 --> 06:16.909
and you just check yourself out.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.078
It's basically a hotel.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.214
I think she needs, like, real help.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.015
You know, like eyes on her at all times,

06:23.082 --> 06:25.451
you know, like full blown. - Yes.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.953
- Can you imagine that person

06:27.053 --> 06:30.456
just out in a restaurant or a state fair?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.191
- Guys,

06:32.258 --> 06:34.560
what if she, like, hates us forever?

06:34.627 --> 06:35.962
- It doesn't matter.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.297
All right, we have to do what's right.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.033
And also finally get her out of our lives

06:41.100 --> 06:42.368
once and for all.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.203
- Nursey, hi.

06:44.270 --> 06:48.975
Can we forcibly commit someone to a mental institution?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.477
- Yeah, you absolutely can. It's called a 5150.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.212
Is that something you'd be interested in today?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.617
- Yeah.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.118
- Whee!

06:59.218 --> 07:01.921
Bye, bye. Bye, bye.

07:01.988 --> 07:05.658
I'd wave if I could. Oh, bye.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.162
Oh, wow, you're so beautiful.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.431
Aw, I love you.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.000
Thank you so much for pushing me with such good care.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.606
- Did we have a car in Babyfoot?

07:20.673 --> 07:21.941
How did we get there?

07:22.008 --> 07:24.343
Didn't we have a--like, we rented a car?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.480
- No, it doesn't matter. Insurance covers everything.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.082
- Guys, we did the right thing, right?

07:30.149 --> 07:31.517
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.653
She ruined our lives, like, ten times over.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.121
Now we're never ever going

07:35.188 --> 07:38.257
to get real good normal jobs ever again.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.826
- So true.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.094
I wouldn't be some news clown if it weren't for Dory.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.629
You know what? I don't want that

07:43.696 --> 07:46.199
hanging over my head anymore. I'm quitting.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.167
- I'm gonna retire too.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.703
It's the last time I'm ever gonna play Dory.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.971
- You know what, guys?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.940
Sorry, actually, I'm gonna head that way.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.541
I have something that I need to take care of

07:55.641 --> 07:57.210
that's actually pretty huge.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.212
- What--El, what do you have to go take care of now?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.513
- Portia, will you just mind

08:00.613 --> 08:01.814
your own goddamn business for once?

08:01.881 --> 08:03.115
- - I'm sorry.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.384
I'm so tired. I love you.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.889
- Babes, El.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.493
- Well, I don't have a place to stay tonight.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.228
If--if I could crash?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.698
- Yeah, you can come over, Drewbie, keep me company.

08:24.136 --> 08:26.572
- Oh, my God, what? - Hi.

08:26.672 --> 08:30.710
I've been thinking and I think we can make it work.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.246
- No!

08:33.346 --> 08:36.382
- Don't get me wrong. Like, I wanna move on

08:36.482 --> 08:38.584
and I wanna love somebody else.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.653
But if I cut ties with Dory,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.822
like, I don't wanna feel like

08:42.889 --> 08:47.093
no one's ever gonna love or know the real me, you know.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.263
Especially not anybody normal.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.499
I gotta really be honest with myself about what I've done.

08:53.566 --> 08:57.770
- Yeah, we're disgusting, and we're cursed.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.239
- Yeah. Just feel like...

09:01.774 --> 09:04.510
- I don't know, nobody new is ever gonna love us.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.612
- So true.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.414
No one is ever gonna understand this.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.918
And it's like, "What?"

09:12.018 --> 09:14.120
What are we supposed to do?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.388
Fuck each other?

09:15.454 --> 09:17.623
- Yeah.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.932
- That's the thing, that's what wasn't working between us.

09:26.032 --> 09:29.435
We were toxic, but we weren't honoring that.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.038
- Right, and that's what makes us soulmates in the shadows.

09:32.104 --> 09:34.607
- Exactly, Mark, exactly.

09:34.707 --> 09:35.942
Yeah, we just need to be better

09:36.042 --> 09:38.311
at communicating our own toxic needs.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
Like, personally, there are moments when I need

09:41.480 --> 09:45.151
to not think about you for huge chunks of time.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.320
You know, that's my own time

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
for me to cut my heart off to you.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.424
- I hear that. - Mm-hmm.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.627
- And, for me,

09:54.727 --> 09:59.632
there are instances when I need you to hurt me.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.436
- Great. - Yeah.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.071
But not in a way that feels planned, you know.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.339
- Yeah.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.307
- I-I want it to feel organic, you know?

10:08.407 --> 10:09.942
Like, I will resent it

10:10.009 --> 10:14.647
if I feel that you feel obligated to hurting me.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.749
- Aww/

10:16.816 --> 10:18.517
Feels so good talking like this.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.687
- It really does.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.926
- So what do you say? Should we go for it?

10:30.029 --> 10:32.932
- Yeah, let's do it.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.335
- Mm...

10:36.435 --> 10:39.872
- I want you to give me a baby.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.711
- That's what I want. - Yeah?

10:45.811 --> 10:48.614
- That's just crazy 'cause I was just thinking that too, so.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.616
- Yeah?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.556
- Do you think that we should have sex?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.693
- I mean, I guess it's kinda like...

11:00.793 --> 11:02.895
we don't have a choice.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.800
- So let the sex begin.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.236
- Right.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.244
How's the temperature in here?

11:52.344 --> 11:54.113
- It's awesome, the temperature.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.619
I'm gonna kiss you. - Okay.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.921
- Okay.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.932
Mm...

12:13.032 --> 12:14.633
Feels nice.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.919
- And to see this grass

13:06.986 --> 13:11.357
or my elbow or the wind is...

13:11.457 --> 13:14.193
it's to experience it all for the first time.

13:14.293 --> 13:18.030
- Would you say it's God?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.132
- Well, Dr. Lombardo,

13:20.199 --> 13:24.870
if I had to give it a name...

13:24.970 --> 13:27.439
it's love.

13:27.506 --> 13:31.877
And I-I just want to convey that to--to everyone, you know.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.113
I want them to feel what I feel.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.683
- Yes, yes.

13:37.783 --> 13:43.656
- I put my soul through so much over the years,

13:43.722 --> 13:48.060
but none of that evolution

13:48.160 --> 13:49.995
could ever hold a candle

13:50.062 --> 13:55.734
to the all-encompassing, total eclipse of death.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.539
I am new.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.576
I am changed.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.879
And yet...

14:06.979 --> 14:11.150
I have been here, always.

14:12.251 --> 14:16.055
- This is probably unprofessional of me to say,

14:16.155 --> 14:19.725
but I wish I were you.

14:19.825 --> 14:23.863
You're the real deal. You're...

14:23.929 --> 14:25.164
enlightened.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.733
You deserve to be let out of here.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.870
- Well, Dr. Lombardo, tell it to the board.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.105
I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it here,

14:33.205 --> 14:37.176
but I finally have a purpose.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.413
I really believe I can help people.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.017
- You've helped me.

14:50.122 --> 14:54.093
- What if I told you, you could grow your own business

14:54.193 --> 14:57.796
on your own terms, free of messy negotiations,

14:57.897 --> 15:01.433
free of bad press, free of shame.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.136
What if I told you with one download of an app

15:04.236 --> 15:06.906
you could set up shop anywhere,

15:06.972 --> 15:11.810
wherever, whenever without anybody stopping you.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.712
SEIZE.

15:13.779 --> 15:18.384
With SEIZE, the law is finally, totally on your side.

15:18.450 --> 15:21.887
This proximity-based grid interface displays individuals

15:21.954 --> 15:24.089
who have no current legal representation

15:24.156 --> 15:25.991
and no means of acquiring one

15:26.091 --> 15:29.762
in the hottest up and coming areas.

15:29.828 --> 15:34.133
You wanna open an organic vegan alcoholic popsicle shop?

15:34.233 --> 15:36.135
Well, let's go ahead and click on granny here

15:36.235 --> 15:39.672
and see if her home would make an excellent storefront.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.640
I mean, pretty great intersection, right?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.676
Lots of foot traffic.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.645
I mean, you gotta think she's tired of the commotion.

15:46.745 --> 15:50.115
You would be doing her such a favor.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.184
And with a database of legal templates,

15:52.284 --> 15:55.654
you will be able to exercise eminent domain

15:55.754 --> 16:00.759
within 48 hours.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.929
- Wait, is that me up there? - Guilty.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.864
- Oh, this is a hoot.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.132
- Oh, that's great.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.868
- Where do we sign?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.172
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

16:13.272 --> 16:14.807
- Don't do what, Bob?

16:14.873 --> 16:17.609
- Don't you abandon me,

16:17.676 --> 16:19.979
just because I gave up everything for you.

16:20.045 --> 16:23.682
- You abandoned me in 1988. - Oh!

16:23.782 --> 16:25.284
- You know what I'm talking about.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.487
- I had to take the job to support

16:28.554 --> 16:29.888
our marijuana habit.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.323
- Stop!

16:31.390 --> 16:33.325
My darling, darling, darling,

16:33.392 --> 16:35.060
stop, stop, stop.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.196
I'm gonna have to intervene. Excuse me, excuse me.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.497
Excuse me, she's coming in.

16:38.564 --> 16:39.965
She's coming in. Let it go, let it go.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.500
Let it go, let it go. Deep breaths.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.003
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.804
I know I'm retired.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.173
I am retired, but I've had a very full career.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.310
I have a lot of credits. A lot of credits.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.646
Ricky, you stopped yourself.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.415
Why? - Oh, I did?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.850
- Mm-hmm. Why?

16:57.916 --> 16:59.718
- Um... - Because of fear.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.086
We all do it.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.388
I'm gonna highlight a little something.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.423
You go sit down. You--go, go.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.159
Let's take it back a few lines.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.062
Don't breathe. Don't blink and go.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.097
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.767
- Don't do what, Bob?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.502
- Don't you--

17:16.568 --> 17:18.504
- You dirty prick.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.606
You dirty fucking prick!

17:20.706 --> 17:23.409
You dirty fucking prick!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.414
Do you see that?

17:28.514 --> 17:31.183
Hey! Did you guys take note of that?

17:31.250 --> 17:35.120
Because that's called being in the moment.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.955
We can't plan life.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.724
When we surrender, we're the most alive.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.126
Beautiful work. Oh, Ricky, beautiful work.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.930
Oh, so that's it. I think this is our last class.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.400
So I'm gonna leave you guys with a little bit of wisdom.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.237
It doesn't work out.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.740
There are no good roles.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.811
You're only gonna be torn down.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.549
If you can find anything else to channel your passion into,

18:03.615 --> 18:05.651
do that.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.155
And if it's at all possible,

18:10.255 --> 18:13.258
just die.

18:13.325 --> 18:14.493
- Is that a martini?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.661
- Is that a martini?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.962
Fuck off.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.063
- Mm! -

18:18.130 --> 18:19.164
I am nervous.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.466
You're sure this is safe, right?

18:20.566 --> 18:22.434
- Mark, every wealthy gay person

18:22.501 --> 18:24.436
has gone with Kiddos. It's aspirational.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.939
The babies here are real conversation starters.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.908
- Good.

18:30.642 --> 18:31.777
- Goss-Doober?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.847
- It's us. - It's us, yeah.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.615
- So, what did you have in mind?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.417
- Well, I think it's safe to say

18:38.484 --> 18:40.352
we would prefer a boy,

18:40.452 --> 18:41.587
a gay baby boy.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.690
- Or even queer. A queer baby.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.425
- And of course we are very open

18:46.492 --> 18:49.161
to all ethnicities, of course. - And religions.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.531
- But it would be ideal if they were 5'11 at the shortest

18:52.631 --> 18:53.966
so that they could carry us up

18:54.032 --> 18:55.534
the stairs to bed when we're very elderly.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.202
- And one blue eye

18:57.302 --> 18:59.171
and one brown eye, maybe, like hostile.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.539
- But it would also be good

19:00.639 --> 19:03.142
if he can make us feel protected like a dad.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.377
Like a son that feels like a dad.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.279
If that's anywhere in your checklist.

19:07.346 --> 19:10.282
- The gene selection techniques that SinGen employees

19:10.349 --> 19:12.684
are certainly capable of being that specific.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.554
However, for the package that you are describing,

19:15.654 --> 19:17.389
we'd have to go all the way back to scratch

19:17.489 --> 19:19.458
and I'd have to put you on a waitlist

19:19.525 --> 19:22.060
for five years, at least.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.232
- To be frank, without a child,

19:27.332 --> 19:29.368
we might not be together in five years.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.837
- Well, there is something I could offer

19:31.904 --> 19:33.071
that might be of interest.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.574
It's a project called Aspen.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.678
A nine-year-old, Aspen was our first bio breed,

19:39.745 --> 19:41.246
and he's still in the facility,

19:41.346 --> 19:44.883
but something tells me you're gonna love him.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.854
- Baby, look, he's perfect.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.322
- That's him.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.257
And this way we could skip all the poop years.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.826
- Mm! - $400,000.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.695
- We have that money. - Wonderful.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.765
Well, then, dads, you wanna do the honors?

19:59.865 --> 20:02.935
- Okay, okay. Ready?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.337
- Yeah. Oh, my God, it's happening.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.441
- Oh! Oh, my God.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.909
We did it.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.511
- Congratulations, Dad.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.179
- Aw. I love you, Dad.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.220
- Mm. - Mm...

20:21.286 --> 20:23.889
- Mm! - Oh...

20:23.956 --> 20:25.424
- It's so good. I love kissing you.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.059
- Yeah. - How about you go,

20:27.125 --> 20:28.927
and then I'll hang back for, like, ten minutes or so,

20:29.027 --> 20:31.296
and then, you know, I'll go in and I'll act totally normal.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.298
So no one will like think we're together or anything.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.600
- I mean, I think it's fun if

20:34.700 --> 20:35.867
we show up at the same time, right?

20:35.934 --> 20:37.069
- No. - No, yeah.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.470
Okay. - No, no.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.806
'Cause I don't want Elliot

20:40.906 --> 20:43.575
to, like, suspect anything.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.644
Not that there's anything to suspect, but you know.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.446
- No, yeah. I mean, it's--it's not like

20:47.546 --> 20:49.448
we're doing anything that we have to be ashamed of.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.151
- Yeah, I'm not ashamed that it's, like, come to this.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.586
- Yeah, I think it's hot as hell.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.923
- Mm-hmm. - So happy.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.927
- Hello. - Hi.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.662
- Welcome to my new home. - Oh, wow.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.330
- You guys arrived at the same time.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.399
- No, no. Just ran into each other

21:07.466 --> 21:09.167
at Le Cordon Bleu coming in.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.669
I told Portia, I was like,

21:10.769 --> 21:12.838
get the hell away from me, you weirdo.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.073
- This place is amazing.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.441
- Thank you. - Oh, my God, I love it,

21:16.508 --> 21:17.909
'cause it really has the same character

21:17.976 --> 21:19.578
that our place had.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.647
You know, you gotta see how I dressed it up without you.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.949
And you, hi.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.150
- Hey, where's the kiddo?

21:25.250 --> 21:27.152
I'd love to meet the little guy.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.520
- Hello.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.989
- Hi there. Hi, I'm Portia.

21:31.089 --> 21:33.925
- Hello, Ms. Davenport, Mr. Gardner.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.028
- Ooh. - Fathers.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.362
- Oh, my gosh. That's so cute.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.864
Did you guys tell him to call us that?

21:38.964 --> 21:40.766
- I can call you whatever you want.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.768
I want you to be comfortable in our home.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.104
- Aww! - That's very sweet of you.

21:46.171 --> 21:47.606
Thank you.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.842
- Why do you two smell like each other?

21:50.942 --> 21:52.844
- What?

21:52.944 --> 21:56.481
- You smell like her and she smells like you.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.117
- No, come on. You're crazy, little man.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.953
That crazy little guy got--

22:02.020 --> 22:04.056
this is wine from, uh...

22:04.156 --> 22:07.659
it wasn't very expensive.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.396
- Ooh, mmm.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.701
Yeah. Mark, this is so elaborate.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.703
Is there a recipe or is it just sort of

22:17.803 --> 22:21.139
like a bunch of ingredients that you mushed into one?

22:21.206 --> 22:23.175
- Ooh, no, it's easy.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.177
You just put potatoes,

22:25.243 --> 22:27.312
bouillon, and a bunch of water in a crepe pan.

22:27.379 --> 22:30.248
And then you just keep layering on butter and vinegar

22:30.349 --> 22:32.918
and keep it wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.921
And then you plate it and then you put it in a blender

22:36.021 --> 22:37.489
and then you re-plate it.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.024
I found it on this account I follow

22:39.091 --> 22:42.094
called BigTimeFoodHacks.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.998
- This is incredible. And it's so pretty.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.334
- Yeah, it's--and you can

22:49.401 --> 22:52.838
really taste the food hacks. - Mm.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.906
So, Portia, any fun new roles coming out.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.275
- Well, I'm--I'm kind of at an age now

22:57.376 --> 22:59.611
when an actress must become a teacher,

22:59.711 --> 23:02.114
sort of pass the baton to the younger generation.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.449
So no more acting for me. - Really?

23:04.549 --> 23:06.118
Well, you didn't tell me you were teaching.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.053
- Yes, I did.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.622
I did tell you that over the one lunch we had this year.

23:10.722 --> 23:11.790
I did tell you that I'm a teacher.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.192
I love to teach. I love it.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.428
- Good.

23:16.528 --> 23:18.263
Drew, what are you doing work-wise?

23:18.363 --> 23:23.235
- Oh, yeah, well, I'm helping launch this company

23:23.301 --> 23:26.204
that could be a huge game changer.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.306
- Wow, fabulous. What is it?

23:28.407 --> 23:31.476
- Oh, it's just this elite service that we need,

23:31.576 --> 23:34.813
and it's about high time that somebody did it, so.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.115
- Cool. But what--what is it?

23:37.215 --> 23:38.717
- Well, it can make a huge impact.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.452
- Right, but what is it? - It's good.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.254
Yeah. Good, good.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.422
- So what is it? Fill the blank.

23:43.488 --> 23:44.990
- It's good, good, good. - It is?

23:45.090 --> 23:48.093
- Well, it is good for the world and it's not bad.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.796
It's not bad. It's not a bad thing, Elliot.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.764
- Oh, okay.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.171
- Is there onion in this?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.505
- You made it, babe.

24:00.605 --> 24:01.740
- Right. Sorry.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.075
Why does it taste so oniony?

24:04.142 --> 24:06.478
I wouldn't even know where to get an onion.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.946
- Probably a grocery store.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.182
- Oh, no. - Oh, my God.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.250
- Ew. - Oh, Aspen, honey, honey.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.019
- He's doing it again. He's doing it again.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.289
- Are you urinating? - Aw, buddy.

24:17.355 --> 24:19.958
- Fathers, may Drew go clean me up?

24:20.025 --> 24:22.294
- Drew, would you mind?

24:24.996 --> 24:28.600
- Yes. I would mind.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.702
- I'm only on this earth once,

24:30.802 --> 24:34.973
and I've been sent to-- to spread love.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.175
Please, you have to let me out.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.344
- Are you still contending with strong feelings

24:39.444 --> 24:41.947
that the world may soon end?

24:44.816 --> 24:49.554
I believe that, if people don't awaken soon,

24:49.654 --> 24:51.890
that something very bad will happen to us, yes.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.726
- Apocalyptic paranoia, feelings of doom,

24:54.826 --> 24:59.297
these dispositions have been around for a very long time.

24:59.364 --> 25:02.400
And we're still here.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.036
- You don't see what I see.

25:05.136 --> 25:08.907
I can see the world so clearly now.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.043
I see through the lies and the illusions.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.915
I have to save everyone from their pain.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.751
- Dory, I-I just wanna reflect back to you

25:19.851 --> 25:21.319
what you just said.

25:21.386 --> 25:24.422
You said you believe that you alone can save the world.

25:24.523 --> 25:29.427
And if we don't let you out, the apocalypse is approaching.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.434
- Where's Dr. Lombardo? - I'm sorry, Dory,

25:36.535 --> 25:39.404
but based on this evaluation and your history,

25:39.504 --> 25:41.172
we believe that it's best

25:41.239 --> 25:42.707
for us to keep you under our care

25:42.774 --> 25:45.710
and hold another evaluation in 18 months.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.550
- Quickly, quickly, before Mark comes back,

25:51.616 --> 25:54.185
put your food in the vase. I-I do this every night.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.687
- Thank God. - Thank you.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.889
- I wasn't gonna say anything, but Jesus Christ.

25:57.956 --> 26:00.559
- I know, I think his meals are some kind of eating disorder.

26:00.625 --> 26:01.760
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna throw up.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.261
- That's good.

26:03.361 --> 26:06.064
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.801
- Yeah.

26:09.901 --> 26:13.104
He did not want to go to sleep, but he did.

26:13.204 --> 26:17.475
- You guys, you finished eating while I was out of the room.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.812
- Yeah. - You are just like Elliot.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.448
- You guys, thank you so much for having us,

26:23.548 --> 26:24.783
because it was just such a great night.

26:24.883 --> 26:26.217
Love your family.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.920
Aspen is just the sweetest little baby boy.

26:28.987 --> 26:30.989
He's fantastic. - Isn't he so proper?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.224
- Yeah. - We're all such adults now.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.394
I mean, it seems like just yesterday we were kids,

26:36.461 --> 26:38.463
you know, young and making mistakes.

26:38.563 --> 26:42.500
- Speaking of mistakes, has anyone visited Dory?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.169
- I have...

26:44.269 --> 26:48.807
not because it's just--it's far.

26:48.907 --> 26:52.077
- And I'm actually actively trying not to think about her.

26:52.143 --> 26:57.916
- Well, I will say that you all seem much calmer.

26:57.983 --> 27:00.518
You know, everything isn't so life or death.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.087
- Mark, you're right.

27:02.153 --> 27:04.089
I think we've all finally turned a new leaf,

27:04.155 --> 27:05.657
and now we can just focus

27:05.757 --> 27:08.927
on what we actually want, to wall off in comfort.

27:08.994 --> 27:11.196
You know, I'm a wealthy stay-at-home dad,

27:11.296 --> 27:14.032
and I'm sorry, but there is nothing wrong with that.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.701
We're adults and adults don't care about making a difference.

27:16.801 --> 27:20.005
- Amen, you guys, here's to not feeling

27:20.105 --> 27:21.606
like we have to change the damn world.

27:21.673 --> 27:22.874
- Yes!

27:22.974 --> 27:25.343
all: To not changing the damn world.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.861
- They're dead! They're all dead!

27:42.961 --> 27:44.062
- Oh, my God. - Run!

27:44.162 --> 27:45.630
- Oh, my God!
