toughest competition.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.819

housemates did.

Another 10 points.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.081
- No mistakes.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.785
- Now, this question

15:53.853 --> 15:55.653

15:55.722 --> 15:57.822
- I personally think
we should go with ryan.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.690
- I agree, he intimidates me.

15:59.743 --> 16:00.758

thing you've done in your

16:05.131 --> 16:07.865
pursuit of your harry potter
knowledge, would you say?

16:07.917 --> 16:11.135
- I used to dress up
as albus dumbledore

16:11.204 --> 16:15.039

did squats in my full beard.

16:18.628 --> 16:20.862

- wow, you don't understand
what this means to me.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.776
- The security guards are
going to come and arrest you

16:34.844 --> 16:36.177
if you walk off with it.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.063

10 point dueling club question

16:48.291 --> 16:50.091
goes to ryan.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.795
The lives of wizarding
family members can take

16:53.863 --> 16:55.396
very different paths.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.250

the same age so I'm going

17:32.135 --> 17:33.918
All right,
now it's your turn again,

who do you want to answer
this 30 point question and why?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.558
- Annie said that she
was intimidated by me.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.626
I'm not so intimidated by her.

17:42.679 --> 17:46.764
Maybe this is the best
slot for our friend annie.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.233
- I'm cool with that.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.319
Now, annie.
- Yes.

how much

17:52.989 --> 17:54.539
does it mean to you,
do you think?

17:54.607 --> 17:55.973
- Harry potter was
the first story

17:56.025 --> 17:57.608
I fell in love with
because it taught me

17:57.677 --> 17:59.677
the power that a good story
can have.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.712
And, you know, growing up
as, like, a little gay kid

18:01.781 --> 18:03.915
in suburbia,
it really has, like,

18:03.983 --> 18:06.200
influenced my values and a good
story can change the world,

18:06.286 --> 18:08.953
and I really do believe
that harry potter has.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.621
- Fabulous.

18:10.673 --> 18:11.873
[cheers and applause]

18:11.958 --> 18:14.692

18:14.761 --> 18:16.928
in "the order of the phoenix,"

18:16.996 --> 18:19.664
power-mad dolores umbridge

18:19.732 --> 18:23.968
fired ravenclaw professor
sybill trelawney.

18:41.304 --> 18:46.791
- So I know that dumbledore
hired her after she made

18:46.860 --> 18:49.861
the prophecy when harry
was about a year old, and this

18:49.929 --> 18:54.866
would be in the fifth movie, so
he would be about 16 years old.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.001
So I think it's b, 16 years.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.491
- Absolutely right,
well done,

19:03.576 --> 19:06.244
and you won 30 points
for your team.

19:06.296 --> 19:09.997
Let's see if your housemates
can add another 30.

19:11.134 --> 19:12.800
Another 30 points!

19:12.886 --> 19:18.322
So now, this question about
slytherin is worth 30 points.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.424
- Since they're doing strategy,
we will too.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.226

19:22.295 --> 19:26.347

vibes and maybe michelle

19:26.432 --> 19:29.300

so should we go with giulia?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.969

- Ready giulia?

19:33.139 --> 19:34.155

to voldemort

19:39.279 --> 19:42.697
at the beginning of
"the deathly hallows part one."

so I'm gonna go with my gut

you're in the lead so

Which game would you
like to start off with?

26:22.014 --> 26:23.380
- Obscuro, please.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.915
- Very good.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.819
Obscuro is a charm that
can be used to conjure

26:28.888 --> 26:32.823

eyes so this game is

26:32.892 --> 26:37.127

had a good amount

- That was the first
thing I noticed

28:51.563 --> 28:52.896
was the back of the chair
had, like,

28:52.965 --> 28:54.331

and stuff.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.999

28:56.068 --> 28:58.869
Now, ravenclaw,
what do you think, actually?

is immediately drawn

to is like this model
of the astronomy tower.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.408

thing, but I don't think

six questions, but this time,

it's worth 150 points.

37:08.677 --> 37:13.013
Well, here on television,
we do everything bigger.

all six answers right,

we'll double those 300 points

37:19.554 --> 37:22.622
