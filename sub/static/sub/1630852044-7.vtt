house for your clients, then.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.341
You should do a little bit
more research on their style

10:42.375 --> 10:44.144

10:44.177 --> 10:47.312

how to politely tell you

11:15.475 --> 11:17.344
I don't want you there.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.879

can't be there for her own sake.

do, call the client,

11:22.782 --> 11:25.850

your wife at our showings"?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.878

Leetal is always

11:46.572 --> 11:50.109

11:50.110 --> 11:51.945
- Sounds like a match
made in Heaven.

11:51.977 --> 11:55.114

11:55.115 --> 11:57.283
<i>do his second
showing uninterrupted.</i>

11:57.317 --> 12:00.528

12:01.539 --> 12:03.558

12:03.559 --> 12:04.724

her and tell her you want

over where we're at thus far,

12:07.226 --> 12:08.495

- Okay.

[horns honking]

42:27.800 --> 42:28.847
- Oh, sh--.
- Uh-oh.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.250
- You guys are fine.

42:30.282 --> 42:33.859
- They're stopping traffic.
- Where is she going?

42:33.860 --> 42:36.255
[indistinct chatter]
- Seems a little angrier.

42:36.289 --> 42:37.990
- She said we're
going the wrong way.

42:38.909 --> 42:39.919
- These are buyers!

42:39.920 --> 42:41.960
- If you go that way,
you're gonna get stuck!

42:41.994 --> 42:43.929
- Oh, my God. Why
did you stop the bus?

42:43.963 --> 42:45.597
- Yeah, we're going
the wrong way.

42:45.632 --> 42:48.601
- We're stuck?
- Should we walk up there?

42:48.635 --> 42:49.768
- No way.
- Should we walk?

42:49.802 --> 42:51.170
No, it's too far. Oh, my God.
- Is it?

42:55.775 --> 42:57.109
[horn honking]

42:57.110 --> 42:58.878
- We hear you. We hear you.
- Okay.

42:58.911 --> 43:01.780
I'm getting really stressed.
Is the police gonna come?

43:01.815 --> 43:03.916
Sorry, guys. Sorry.
Oh, whoa, whoa.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.784
We got this under control.

43:05.818 --> 43:07.619
- Oh, listen to them
revving their engines.

43:07.653 --> 43:08.655
They are mad.

43:08.688 --> 43:12.579
- You have room. You have room.
- Sorry, guys.

43:13.860 --> 43:15.295
Aah!

43:15.327 --> 43:17.629
<i>This is not a hiccup.</i>

43:17.630 --> 43:19.965
This is, like, a
frickin' disaster.

43:20.659 --> 43:21.300
Oh, my God.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.689
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh,
no. [horn honking]

43:23.690 --> 43:24.670
<i>There's honking.
There's screaming.</i>

43:24.704 --> 43:27.606
Like, time is ticking. Like,
I don't know what to do.

43:27.639 --> 43:29.742
What's happening? [horn honking]

43:29.775 --> 43:31.978
What's happening?

43:32.780 --> 43:35.315
<i>- Next time on "Million
Dollar Listing: Los Angeles"...</i>

43:35.347 --> 43:37.951
- What's your background?
Like, you produce only?

43:37.983 --> 43:40.859
- I'm Justin Bieber's
music director.

43:40.860 --> 43:41.688
- I need to know location.

43:41.721 --> 43:44.724
- The furthest is I want
to go is Encino or the 405.

43:44.757 --> 43:46.126
- No to Tarzana, or yes?

43:46.159 --> 43:47.827
- Yes to Tarzana.
- No to Tarzana.

43:47.860 --> 43:48.894
- Oh, sh--.

43:48.927 --> 43:50.130
<i>- It's so bright and beautiful.</i>

43:50.163 --> 43:51.797
I mean, the location is perfect.

43:51.831 --> 43:54.099
- But for me, I have to
have something that's new.

43:54.134 --> 43:57.102
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

43:57.103 --> 43:59.706
- So I was actually
just talking to this agent

43:59.739 --> 44:01.641
who has something
that we should look at.

44:01.675 --> 44:03.742
It looked really cute. You
want to come with me?

44:03.777 --> 44:05.448
- Absolutely.

44:05.449 --> 44:06.945
<i>- Let's see the bathroom.</i>

44:07.469 --> 44:08.947
[screams]

44:09.489 --> 44:11.717
- Great for anyone
else, not for you.

44:11.751 --> 44:13.529
- We have to go.

44:13.530 --> 44:14.219
- I can't believe
this is happening.

44:14.253 --> 44:15.355
- When are we
going to the house?

44:15.387 --> 44:16.956
- We don't have time for this.
- Wait!

44:17.570 --> 44:19.159
- Aah! Stop, stop!
- No, don't tell her to stop.

44:19.192 --> 44:20.693
- So much for six minutes.

44:20.726 --> 44:21.860
- Aah!
