Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

00:02.518 --> 00:04.506
<i>Is this what</i>
<i>you're looking for?</i>

00:04.507 --> 00:06.941
Ezra is taking on these
big responsibilities.

00:06.942 --> 00:08.009
And he needs a job.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.177
The park rangers found a body.

00:09.178 --> 00:10.445
It was Toby.

00:10.446 --> 00:12.147
( Sighs )

00:12.148 --> 00:14.082
No, Spence, it wasn't.

00:14.083 --> 00:17.118
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

00:17.119 --> 00:18.653
Please, tell me.

00:18.654 --> 00:20.087
I'm here to pick up Malcolm.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.288
Your friend
picked me up instead.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.023
She said her name was Alison.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.824
They just found a body tonight.
Where?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.326
Exactly where Spencer
said it was.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.762
I don't think that
I can do this, anymore.

00:28.763 --> 00:32.198
Look at all that's happened
since you turned me down on

00:32.200 --> 00:33.200
our little drive
up the Mountain.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.138
( Screaming )

00:39.139 --> 00:42.608
Spencer: You don't have to
ask me again, Mona. I'm in.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.116
Maybe she's just
as nervous about

00:50.117 --> 00:51.950
seeing us as we are
about seeing her.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.518
Guys, she's
the exact same Spencer

00:53.519 --> 00:55.153
that we saw last week.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.456
No, the Spencer we saw in Radley
was not the Spencer I know.

00:57.457 --> 00:58.756
That was before.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.961
Em, we're not just here for
her, we're for you, too.

01:04.363 --> 01:05.830
Do we talk about him?

01:05.831 --> 01:08.099
Do we bring it up?

01:08.100 --> 01:11.268
I don't want to say anything
that could put her back there.

01:12.737 --> 01:13.904
( Sighing )

01:13.905 --> 01:16.440
I know they said
they found Toby,

01:16.441 --> 01:18.742
but they sent that second
body to the state coroner

01:18.743 --> 01:21.245
for a reason. I mean,
maybe there's hope.

01:22.581 --> 01:24.547
You know how I feel about hope.

01:26.683 --> 01:28.451
Breeds eternal misery.

01:31.122 --> 01:33.590
We lost Toby a long time ago.

01:33.591 --> 01:35.325
We just didn't know it.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.095
Oh, you've got to love
the Hastings.

01:39.096 --> 01:40.929
I just get released
from a mental hospital,

01:40.930 --> 01:44.899
and they welcome my friends
with tea and crumpets.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.535
What's the difference
between a crumpet

01:46.536 --> 01:47.569
and an English muffin?

01:47.570 --> 01:49.438
Hanna, does it matter?

01:49.439 --> 01:51.507
I'm just making conversation.

01:51.508 --> 01:53.808
An English muffin is a baked bread.
It's made of dough.

01:53.809 --> 01:57.911
And a crumpet
is a griddle cake.

01:57.912 --> 02:00.714
It's made of batter.

02:00.715 --> 02:03.317
How are you, Spence?

02:03.318 --> 02:04.385
I'm all right.

02:04.386 --> 02:05.386
You know, you don't
have to pretend

02:05.387 --> 02:06.687
to be okay for us.

02:06.688 --> 02:08.356
Yeah, if this was
the act you had to pull off

02:08.357 --> 02:09.923
to get out of there, then...

02:09.924 --> 02:12.626
Do you remember when you were
in the light house, Emily?

02:12.627 --> 02:14.962
And you had to make
that choice?

02:14.963 --> 02:17.131
It was either him or you?

02:17.132 --> 02:20.901
I wasn't as strong as you were.

02:20.902 --> 02:23.537
When I saw Toby in the woods,

02:23.538 --> 02:26.640
like that, I just gave up.

02:26.641 --> 02:28.708
So what changed?

02:28.709 --> 02:30.677
You seem like you're
back to yourself.

02:30.678 --> 02:33.846
I decided I didn't want
to be victim anymore.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.317
That's not who I am.

02:39.586 --> 02:41.888
Here.

02:41.889 --> 02:43.322
What's this?

02:43.323 --> 02:45.791
My parents told all of
their friends that I went

02:45.792 --> 02:47.592
to Radley for exhaustion,
so they want to throw

02:47.593 --> 02:49.194
a soiree to make sure
that everybody knows that

02:49.195 --> 02:50.595
I'm all better now.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.601
Could really use some support.

02:56.602 --> 02:58.003
Can you guys please come?

02:58.004 --> 02:59.637
Of course.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.971
Sure.
Yeah, you know

03:00.972 --> 03:03.607
we'd do anything for you.

03:03.608 --> 03:06.944
I'm counting on that.

04:33.193 --> 04:34.994
Spencer: Did Malcolm tell
you what she looked like?

04:34.995 --> 04:36.761
No, he just said she
was a friend of mine,

04:36.762 --> 04:38.263
and her name was Alison.
That's all I know.

04:38.264 --> 04:40.331
Well, look... you have to
talk to him, find out more.

04:40.332 --> 04:43.668
Yeah, like did she have dark
hair, horns, and a tail?

04:43.669 --> 04:47.438
Guys, no, we are not using
Malcolm to get to Mona.

04:47.439 --> 04:49.107
You know, the last time
I saw Ezra

04:49.108 --> 04:50.608
I could hardly face him.

04:50.609 --> 04:52.276
All we have to do is show
Mona's picture to the kid.

04:52.277 --> 04:53.944
He'll confirm that Mona took him
and the cops will

04:53.945 --> 04:56.146
take our Lulu head
back to the nut farm.

04:57.481 --> 04:59.349
Hanna.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.418
Sorry, Spence.
My bad.

05:02.821 --> 05:04.521
I don't know,
it seems like a really

05:04.522 --> 05:05.956
bold move for Mona.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.657
The risk being seen like that?

05:08.658 --> 05:11.027
What are you saying, Spence?

05:11.028 --> 05:12.228
It feels desperate.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.230
Like maybe she's
trying to get caught.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.399
Okay, well, Malcolm
is off limits, okay?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.168
Gotta get to class.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.373
I can use some extra money.

05:25.374 --> 05:26.908
Did you not just hear Aria?

05:26.909 --> 05:29.444
Em, kids love me.
I'll make a game out of it.

05:29.445 --> 05:32.147
Shana: Hey, Emily.
Hey.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.581
What-uh-what are
you doing here?

05:33.582 --> 05:35.150
Our coach arranged
for us to practice

05:35.151 --> 05:36.351
here this morning.

05:36.352 --> 05:39.154
But I say if it's water,
it's wet, right?

05:39.155 --> 05:41.388
A pool's a pool.

05:41.389 --> 05:43.623
I don't think we've met.

05:43.624 --> 05:47.328
Uh, shana, this is Spencer.

05:47.329 --> 05:48.896
Uh, you swim for Oakwood?

05:48.897 --> 05:51.732
Amongst other things.
Will you be at the meet?

05:51.733 --> 05:53.467
Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

05:53.468 --> 05:56.435
I'll look for you.
Good luck, Emily.

05:56.436 --> 05:58.637
You, too.

05:58.638 --> 06:00.039
( Sighing )

06:01.141 --> 06:03.343
I hate her.
Why?

06:03.344 --> 06:07.113
Because she flirts with
everyone but me.

06:07.114 --> 06:08.381
Shana's bad news.

06:08.382 --> 06:10.917
Wherever she goes,
trouble follows.

06:12.018 --> 06:13.852
( Bell rings )

06:16.689 --> 06:19.324
Well, it was great seeing you.

06:19.325 --> 06:20.359
Take care.

06:22.661 --> 06:25.197
Hey.
Hey.

06:25.198 --> 06:27.832
Did you have another interview?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.334
Yeah, they called this morning.

06:30.335 --> 06:31.969
Well, that's good.

06:31.970 --> 06:33.170
Probably means that
they're interested

06:33.171 --> 06:35.106
in having you back.

06:35.107 --> 06:38.442
I don't think it's
going to work out for me.

06:38.443 --> 06:40.211
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:57.194 --> 07:01.163
You said you were going
to make it all go away.

07:01.164 --> 07:03.966
I'm worried that the police
have evidence.

07:06.002 --> 07:07.970
Look, I need to see you today.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.516
( Phone beeps )

07:26.155 --> 07:29.090
I've got to go.
Bye.

07:42.991 --> 07:45.326
I just got off
the phone with your mom.

07:45.327 --> 07:47.662
Did you know that Ezra
was applying for

07:47.663 --> 07:48.963
a teaching job
at Rosewood high?

07:48.964 --> 07:52.065
Yeah, he applied for a job
subbing in the district.

07:52.066 --> 07:55.602
Listen, your mom and I
recognize that Ezra

07:55.603 --> 07:57.604
needs to find a way
to support his son.

07:57.605 --> 08:01.107
But he cannot teach in Rosewood if
you two are still seeing each other.

08:01.108 --> 08:02.342
Your leaving us no choice...

08:02.343 --> 08:06.646
dad, slow down, okay.
He's not getting the job.

08:06.647 --> 08:09.081
He was offered the position
this morning, Aria.

08:10.684 --> 08:13.286
Ezra asked for the day to
decide if he wants to take it.

08:17.957 --> 08:21.494
So, Aria didn't tell me that you
were interested in the job.

08:21.495 --> 08:23.361
Oh, well, I didn't tell
her because I didn't want

08:23.362 --> 08:25.830
to feel pressured if you
gave me the gig. Ahh.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.499
Thank you.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.067
So, Malcolm's seven, right?
Mm-hmm.

08:30.068 --> 08:33.070
What's he into?
Fast cars and fast girls?

08:35.207 --> 08:38.741
It's a joke.
He's into trains.

08:38.743 --> 08:41.679
Oh! Well, all aboard the Hanna express.
( Laughs )

08:43.948 --> 08:47.484
Um, do you have
a resume, or anything?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.953
Honestly, I haven't
baby sat since I was 15.

08:49.954 --> 08:52.389
But my mom's in New York,
Caleb's out of town,

08:52.390 --> 08:53.691
so, I have a lot
of time to kill.

08:53.692 --> 08:56.392
And I could use
the extra money.

08:56.393 --> 08:59.228
Okay. I have an
appointment tonight,

08:59.229 --> 09:01.664
so, if you're free,

09:01.665 --> 09:03.633
we can give it a test run.

09:03.634 --> 09:05.335
See if it's a good fit.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.236
Well, it will be, promise.

09:07.237 --> 09:08.904
( Imitates train whistle )
( Laughs )

09:28.724 --> 09:30.624
I've missed you.

09:32.293 --> 09:34.161
( Aircraft drone )

09:35.564 --> 09:37.865
They'll all be together
this Friday.

09:37.866 --> 09:40.067
You know what you need to do.

09:40.068 --> 09:44.437
Shana: Yeah. What did the
doctor say about your eyes?

09:44.438 --> 09:47.774
Um, I'll have good days
and bad days.

09:47.775 --> 09:50.978
Eventually they'll all be bad.

09:59.319 --> 10:01.053
On your darkest days,

10:01.054 --> 10:02.922
you know I'll be here for you.

10:10.931 --> 10:12.631
Ezra: Hey.

10:19.972 --> 10:21.472
Is everything okay?

10:23.109 --> 10:25.743
Why didn't you tell me that
they offered you the job?

10:27.846 --> 10:30.115
'Cause I don't think
I'm going to take it.

10:30.116 --> 10:33.417
And I didn't think you should share
in the burden of that decision.

10:33.418 --> 10:36.053
You need a job, Ezra.
Yeah,

10:36.054 --> 10:38.222
but you know what would
happen to us if I end up

10:38.223 --> 10:40.690
back at Rosewood.

10:40.691 --> 10:44.295
Things are different now.
People know about us.

10:44.296 --> 10:46.797
Hey, don't... don't cry.
Don't cry.

10:46.798 --> 10:49.498
We're okay.
No, we're not.

10:51.668 --> 10:54.770
Nothing about
us feels right anymore.

10:57.841 --> 10:59.943
I'm sorry.

10:59.944 --> 11:02.711
It's not your fault.
I want to fix this.

11:02.712 --> 11:04.112
I know.

11:04.113 --> 11:07.715
I know, but you can't.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.953
Okay, we've been chasing
after what we used to have

11:10.954 --> 11:15.090
ever since you found out
about Malcolm, but...

11:15.091 --> 11:17.492
I just don't...

11:17.493 --> 11:20.094
I don't think that
we can ever get that back.

11:24.266 --> 11:28.069
Things aren't easy,
but they can still be good.

11:28.070 --> 11:30.071
It shouldn't be this hard.

11:34.676 --> 11:38.144
If you're not happy anymore...

11:40.948 --> 11:43.183
You know, that's
what matters most to me.

11:47.054 --> 11:50.623
Hey, I love you just
as much as I always have.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.793
And that's why I want you
to take this job.

12:03.036 --> 12:05.471
Aria, wait, wait.
( Clears throat )

12:09.674 --> 12:11.009
I love you.

♪ I'm nowhere else to go ♪

13:43.440 --> 13:45.275
Hanna got the job.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.579
I know.

13:55.819 --> 13:57.519
Spencer.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.222
When I was in Radley,

14:00.223 --> 14:02.224
Mona told me that you
were alive.

14:03.393 --> 14:06.062
I wanted to believe her,
but until now...

14:08.130 --> 14:10.832
Back in the woods,

14:10.833 --> 14:12.266
was that you?

14:13.803 --> 14:15.369
Were you a part of it?

14:16.438 --> 14:17.772
Mona told me after.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.308
And you let me believe
that you were dead?

14:21.977 --> 14:25.779
Everything I've done,
was so I could protect you.

14:27.148 --> 14:29.750
I want to believe that.

14:29.751 --> 14:31.852
Let me take you somewhere safe.

14:35.156 --> 14:36.924
Does Mona know you're here?

14:36.925 --> 14:38.458
No.

14:40.594 --> 14:44.063
She told me you'd
be there Friday.

14:44.064 --> 14:47.700
That you'd be my reward
for delivering the girls.

14:50.537 --> 14:53.372
How'd you find me?

14:53.373 --> 14:55.173
She left me alone in her lair.

14:57.676 --> 15:00.145
I kidnapped
a seven-year-old.

15:02.381 --> 15:05.917
I'm the reason that Aria
and Ezra broke up.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.919
So, I've earned her trust.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.188
It's not safe for you
to be here.

15:11.189 --> 15:15.126
I stopped worrying about me
a long time ago.

15:15.127 --> 15:17.728
What we had was real.

15:17.729 --> 15:19.596
I've been pretending to work
with Mona

15:19.597 --> 15:22.166
so I could keep you safe.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.935
I need you to believe me.

15:28.939 --> 15:31.207
And I need you to follow me.

15:46.555 --> 15:48.490
( Television cartoon playing )

15:49.625 --> 15:51.927
Hanna:
Do want to play a game?

15:51.928 --> 15:53.495
Come on, it'll be fun.

15:53.496 --> 15:56.131
My dad said I can
watch cartoons.

15:56.132 --> 15:58.833
Hanna: Fine.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.869
But you should know that
watching TV rots your brain.

16:03.272 --> 16:05.940
It's your choice if you want
to grow up to be stupid.

16:07.475 --> 16:09.376
Just sayin'.

16:13.248 --> 16:14.981
Okay, let's play "guess who."

16:14.982 --> 16:16.482
I'll show you a picture
of a person,

16:16.483 --> 16:19.752
and you tell me if you know them.
Okay.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.556
That's Aria.

16:23.557 --> 16:25.425
See. You're good at this.

16:25.426 --> 16:27.027
Okay.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.761
Do you know her?

16:30.497 --> 16:32.298
She didn't take you
to the carnival?

16:32.299 --> 16:34.967
I went with Aria's friend,
Alison.

16:38.071 --> 16:40.039
Is this Alison?
Nope.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.142
What about this?
Nope.

16:46.679 --> 16:50.681
What about this person?
That's a boy.

16:53.418 --> 16:55.286
I am going to go call
my friend really quick.

16:55.287 --> 16:57.755
Can I play a game
on your phone?

16:57.756 --> 17:00.058
Sure.

17:09.901 --> 17:11.335
( Phone ringing )

17:11.336 --> 17:12.435
Emily:
<i>Hey.</i>

17:12.435 --> 17:13.803
I struck out.

17:13.804 --> 17:16.806
He's seven.
Maybe he's confused.

17:16.807 --> 17:18.540
( Knocking on window )

17:18.541 --> 17:21.609
Hanna.
I gotta call you back.

17:39.195 --> 17:40.829
I don't understand, they have
the tapes and that can't...

17:40.830 --> 17:42.598
no, I do understand,
but those bitches

17:42.599 --> 17:43.932
are going to be at
the lodge at nine.

17:43.933 --> 17:45.834
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.

17:52.107 --> 17:54.108
( Indistinct whispering )

18:05.721 --> 18:07.921
Doesn't look
like anybody lives here.

18:09.557 --> 18:13.026
I shuffle between a few motels.

18:13.027 --> 18:15.028
Mona doesn't know
about this one.

18:22.570 --> 18:25.137
And red coat?

18:25.138 --> 18:29.207
The only thing I know about red
coat is that she's in charge.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.980
I know.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.418
You still don't trust me.

18:40.419 --> 18:46.290
Look, I understand why
you've been helping Mona.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.093
I made the same decision.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.297
But if I saw you hurting,

18:53.298 --> 18:55.499
the way I know you saw me...

19:04.175 --> 19:06.343
( Scoffs )

19:10.414 --> 19:11.481
Toby.

19:56.725 --> 19:59.192
No wonder I was a fat kid.

19:59.193 --> 20:01.127
When my dad cheated on my mom
and left us to

20:01.128 --> 20:03.796
start a new family,
I had a box of these a night.

20:03.797 --> 20:05.064
( Phone beeping )
But I would get some peanut

20:05.065 --> 20:07.667
butter and that frosting in
a can and have a party.

20:07.668 --> 20:10.870
Alison's right here.

20:10.871 --> 20:12.005
What?

20:12.006 --> 20:13.907
She's in this picture.

20:15.775 --> 20:18.343
I don't remember that.

20:18.344 --> 20:21.780
It just popped up.

20:21.781 --> 20:24.315
That can't be who you saw.

20:24.316 --> 20:26.618
That's Aria's friend, Alison.

20:28.955 --> 20:30.656
No, Malcolm, that girl's...

20:30.657 --> 20:32.089
I remember her pretty hair.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.792
That's her, Hanna.
With the blue shirt.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.131
Spencer?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.119
That's Allison.

20:48.145 --> 20:50.243
I mean he said she was the girl
in the blue shirt.

20:50.244 --> 20:52.545
This is crazy.

20:52.546 --> 20:53.879
And you're saying,
that shana knows Jenna.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.949
And that the both of them are
meeting up with Melissa?

20:56.950 --> 20:58.418
This is crazier than crazy.

20:58.419 --> 20:59.618
I mean, Radley's
looking better every day.

20:59.619 --> 21:00.919
I'm actually ready to check in.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.487
We're going to figure it out.

21:02.488 --> 21:03.821
I've already got it
figured out.

21:03.822 --> 21:05.590
Spencer's part of the a-team.
Game over.

21:05.591 --> 21:07.692
Today it's me and Ezra. Tomorrow
it'll be you and Caleb.

21:07.693 --> 21:09.127
And then it's going
to be your turn Emily,

21:09.128 --> 21:10.828
so get ready to say
goodbye to Paige,

21:10.829 --> 21:12.997
'cause I promise you, "A's"
going to take her from you.

21:14.067 --> 21:15.967
Why would Spencer
do this to us?

21:15.968 --> 21:17.468
Guys, I don't believe
for one second

21:17.469 --> 21:18.902
that Spencer's on
the a-team.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.071
Okay, if she is
working with Mona

21:20.072 --> 21:21.872
then there has to be more
to the story.

21:21.873 --> 21:24.341
We don't know what happened in Radley.
But Spencer went in

21:24.342 --> 21:27.644
there at rock bottom. And she
came out like a shiny new penny.

21:27.645 --> 21:29.680
Are you thinking
shock treatment?

21:32.384 --> 21:36.587
No. No, I'm saying that Mona
spent a lot of time in Radley.

21:36.588 --> 21:37.854
And maybe she made
some friends.

21:37.855 --> 21:39.456
And maybe Spencer talked
to some of those friends.

21:39.457 --> 21:41.391
Mona asked Spencer
to join the a-team

21:41.392 --> 21:43.560
on the night of
the masquerade ball.

21:43.561 --> 21:45.261
Did Spencer
finally take her up on it?

21:45.262 --> 21:47.163
Yeah, but why now?
There's a way to prove

21:47.164 --> 21:48.731
that Spencer's still with us,

21:48.732 --> 21:51.166
and if Mona's watching,
it won't put Spencer at risk.

21:56.506 --> 21:57.940
( Dance music starts playing )

21:57.941 --> 22:00.977
Really, Hanna? You're in
the mood for a dance party?

22:00.978 --> 22:05.446
Look, a was everywhere before
Spencer joined the a-team.

22:05.447 --> 22:07.849

we're meeting in secret?

( Soft music playing )

23:54.550 --> 23:56.518
Aria.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.489
I took the job.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.764
You remember what you
said at Ali's funeral?

24:13.134 --> 24:15.869
You were right. There never
was a happy ending for us.

24:20.141 --> 24:23.276
You know, this doesn't
have to be forever.

24:23.277 --> 24:24.577
You're graduating
in seven months.

24:24.578 --> 24:27.480
And I wish that
I could hold onto that.

24:27.481 --> 24:28.414
But, it's too hard.

24:31.918 --> 24:33.986
I need to move on,
and so do you.

24:41.962 --> 24:43.963
Bye, Ezra.

25:19.396 --> 25:21.397
( Crowd cheering )
( Announcer indistinct )

25:31.208 --> 25:33.441
Announcer: And what a win
for the red devils!

27:11.034 --> 27:12.334
What is this?

27:12.335 --> 27:14.803
You followed me here,
that means you don't

27:14.804 --> 27:15.804
know who she is, either.

27:17.607 --> 27:18.807
And if you don't
know who she is,

27:18.808 --> 27:20.709
that means you're
still one of us.

27:29.687 --> 27:30.977
Look Spencer...
Whatever it is,

27:30.994 --> 27:32.428
no matter how deep
you're into this,

27:32.429 --> 27:34.763
you know that you can
tell us the truth, right?

27:34.764 --> 27:36.365
We want to help you.

27:43.406 --> 27:47.008
Mona came to see me at Radley.

27:47.009 --> 27:49.944
And when I found Toby
in the woods,

27:49.945 --> 27:51.712
she'd planned the whole thing.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.314
She wanted to break
me so that she could

27:53.315 --> 27:55.916
put me back together.
Like her own humpty dumpty.

27:55.917 --> 27:58.519
So, Mona made you an offer
you couldn't refuse?

27:58.520 --> 28:01.855
She told me that
Toby was still alive.

28:01.856 --> 28:03.157
Emily:
Toby's alive?

28:03.158 --> 28:05.192
And it's true.

28:06.594 --> 28:09.096
It's true, he's been
working with Mona because

28:09.097 --> 28:10.797
he found out about red coat
and Mona's the only person

28:10.798 --> 28:12.998
who knows who she is.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.701
And you've seen him?
Yeah.

28:15.702 --> 28:17.236
Last night.

28:18.638 --> 28:21.807
He's on our side.
You guys, he always was.

28:21.808 --> 28:24.510
But this party tomorrow,
it's a set-up.

28:24.511 --> 28:26.345
Red coat just wants us all
to be together.

28:26.346 --> 28:29.347
Why? What's she gonna do to us?
I don't know.

28:29.348 --> 28:31.783
But we're not going
to let it happen.

28:31.784 --> 28:33.651
Okay, whatever it is,
we're one step ahead of her,

28:33.652 --> 28:36.154
finally, and there are
two of us on the inside.

28:36.155 --> 28:37.822
And when were you going
to clue us in on

28:37.823 --> 28:40.024
your double agent status,
nikita?

28:40.025 --> 28:42.961
I'm the one who sent you
the picture of me and Ali.

28:42.962 --> 28:44.595
And you did exactly what
I needed you to do.

28:44.596 --> 28:46.530
Because Mona watches
my every move.

28:46.531 --> 28:49.700
You've found a way to get to me
without her knowing about it.

28:49.701 --> 28:52.736
So, instead of red coat
waiting for us tomorrow,

28:52.737 --> 28:54.071
we'll be waiting for her.

28:54.072 --> 28:55.672
And if we're lucky,
this will all be over with.

28:56.808 --> 28:58.976
Luck won't have
anything to do with it.

29:00.411 --> 29:01.911
( Bell ringing )

29:04.248 --> 29:06.182
( Students murmuring )

29:27.837 --> 29:30.105
Ezra:
All right, good morning.

29:30.106 --> 29:31.972
My name is mister Fitz.

29:31.973 --> 29:34.342
And I'm back as
your substitute teacher.

29:34.343 --> 29:36.611
Uh, if we open up
to chapter one,

29:36.612 --> 29:39.013
we'll find out
why Hemingway said,

29:39.014 --> 29:42.049
"all things truly wicked,
start from innocence."

30:00.000 --> 30:02.169
It's perfect timing, actually.

30:02.170 --> 30:03.602
I need a pick-me-up.

30:03.603 --> 30:06.038
That place is really nice.

30:06.039 --> 30:09.241
It's the Hastings. Were you
expecting "donuts and dogs"?

30:10.443 --> 30:12.944
How can you afford
new miu mius?

30:12.945 --> 30:14.846
Oh! I borrowed them.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.216
The store gives full
refunds for returns.

30:17.217 --> 30:18.617
That's if you don't wear them.

30:18.618 --> 30:20.652
Doesn't say that
on the receipt.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.265
( Phone beeps )

30:35.266 --> 30:36.300
They're running late.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.934
How late?

30:47.144 --> 30:49.946
They're on their way.
That's all I know.

30:49.947 --> 30:52.014
She's expecting all
of you to be here.

30:52.015 --> 30:53.683
And we will be.

30:56.953 --> 31:00.556
You have no idea what she's
capable of, Spencer.

31:00.557 --> 31:03.693
Trust me. You don't
want to disappoint her.

31:03.694 --> 31:05.428
I saw them getting ready.

31:05.429 --> 31:08.597
And I have the video
you asked for.

31:08.598 --> 31:10.131
They don't suspect anything.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.735
Hanna: You guys,
I'm serious about not

31:13.736 --> 31:14.969
taking back those shoes.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.304
Emily:
Hanna, quiet!

31:16.305 --> 31:17.872
We've got to get inside
before red coat shows up.

31:17.873 --> 31:20.508
If she knows we're onto her,
we'll never find out who she is.

31:21.711 --> 31:23.877
Aria:
Are we sure we trust Toby?

31:23.878 --> 31:25.078
Emily:
Spencer does.

31:25.079 --> 31:26.280
Hanna:
Do we have a choice?

31:26.281 --> 31:28.415
Emily:
It's all according to plan.

31:28.416 --> 31:30.851
( Aircraft drone )

31:30.852 --> 31:32.419
Mona:
How far away are you?

31:32.420 --> 31:34.988
It's safe for you to land.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.459
It's finally about to end.

31:41.062 --> 31:43.563
You're getting what
you've always wanted.

31:45.633 --> 31:49.002
She doesn't know
the others aren't here yet.

31:49.003 --> 31:51.071
I told you, they're coming.

31:58.779 --> 32:01.881
Why don't we for a walk
while we wait?

32:12.658 --> 32:15.393
I'll take care of Spencer.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.494
Toby?

32:17.763 --> 32:20.364
I know how you feel, Spencer.

32:20.365 --> 32:22.433
It sucks to be lied to.

32:22.434 --> 32:23.501
Get up.

32:23.502 --> 32:24.803
I believed you.

32:24.804 --> 32:26.737
I said get up!

32:29.340 --> 32:30.874
You won't get away with this.

32:30.875 --> 32:34.744
I'd say "watch me," but you
won't be here to see it.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.847
( Spencer struggling )

32:46.990 --> 32:49.292
( Aircraft droning )

32:53.730 --> 32:55.264
If something goes wrong,

32:55.265 --> 32:57.300
you know what you need to do.

33:14.317 --> 33:16.050
Going somewhere?

33:27.640 --> 33:29.487
You're making a terrible
mistake.

33:29.529 --> 33:30.729
That's not how we see it.

33:30.730 --> 33:31.998
Because you don't see.

33:31.999 --> 33:34.200
You have know idea
what's going on here.

33:34.201 --> 33:35.334
We know enough.

33:45.511 --> 33:47.645
( Sound of branches breaking )

33:47.646 --> 33:49.514
Who is that?

33:51.683 --> 33:53.985
Get to the plane.
Wait, Toby!

33:53.986 --> 33:56.754
Be careful. Remember why
we're here, Spencer.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.856
You see her.
She doesn't see you.

34:24.514 --> 34:26.282
What have you done?

34:40.029 --> 34:42.597
( Phone dialing )
Mona, try your phone.

34:43.699 --> 34:45.199
Nothing.

34:45.201 --> 34:46.634
How can you not have a signal?
We saw you make a call.

34:46.635 --> 34:48.469
It's her. Don't you get it?
She can do anything.

34:48.469 --> 34:49.937
She's everywhere
and she's nowhere.

34:51.139 --> 34:52.806
Come on, let's get out of here.

35:00.915 --> 35:01.849
Hanna:
It's locked!

35:10.324 --> 35:12.192
( Screams )

35:12.193 --> 35:14.694
We're gonna die.
We're all going to burn.

35:14.695 --> 35:15.862
Shut up, Mona!

35:15.863 --> 35:18.064
I'm never going
to know who she was.

35:18.065 --> 35:19.765
Aria: What did you just say?

35:21.834 --> 35:23.135
Red coat.

35:23.136 --> 35:24.703
I don't know who she is either.

35:24.704 --> 35:26.738
Are you kidding?

35:26.739 --> 35:28.340
You guys, we have
to get out of here.

35:51.730 --> 35:53.130
Ali?

37:44.701 --> 37:46.769
( Explosion in the distance )

37:50.807 --> 37:52.308
( All coughing )

37:59.416 --> 38:02.284
Did anyone see her?

38:02.285 --> 38:03.885
See who?

38:03.886 --> 38:07.656
Alison. She pulled me out of
there. She pulled us all out.

38:08.891 --> 38:11.193
No, you're hallucinating.

38:11.194 --> 38:12.827
She was here.
I swear it.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.868
Ali's dead.

38:22.938 --> 38:24.372
I saw her, too.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.710
So did I.

38:30.146 --> 38:32.346
Spencer:
Ali is red coat.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.387
( House collapses )

39:11.050 --> 39:14.285
So all of this started
when you were at Radley?

39:14.286 --> 39:15.987
I made a deal with the devil.

39:15.988 --> 39:18.656
And she gave me a way in
and out of that place.

39:18.657 --> 39:23.427
At first it was fun,
having a partner.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.529
But then the game changed.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.331
She stole you from me.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.933
So what happened that night?

39:28.934 --> 39:30.601
Were you there at the cemetery?

39:30.602 --> 39:32.937
Did you drug me?
Did you take Ali's body?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.471
Mona: I don't know
who drugged you.

39:34.472 --> 39:37.140
But I was at the cemetery
and so was red coat.

39:37.141 --> 39:39.943
How could you
not see who it was?

39:39.944 --> 39:41.811
Mona:
She was wearing a mask.

39:41.812 --> 39:45.982
She looked just like Ali.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.285
That's probably
what happened tonight.

39:49.286 --> 39:51.888
It wasn't Ali.
It was a mask.

39:54.557 --> 39:56.391
Guys?

40:00.864 --> 40:02.197
Wait, is that?

40:03.366 --> 40:05.801
Somebody pulled it out
of the lake.

40:15.210 --> 40:18.179
( Indistinct talking
coming from car )

40:19.748 --> 40:22.150
Recording coming from car:
<i>Think this through, Ashley.</i>

40:22.151 --> 40:24.618
Woman's recorded voice:
<i>How do you live with yourself?</i>

40:24.619 --> 40:28.322
Man's recorded voice:
<i>We're not done here.</i>

40:28.323 --> 40:29.723
<i>Hey!</i>

40:31.192 --> 40:33.193
We've have to get
this out of here.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.736
Aria:
Wait! There's more.

40:45.205 --> 40:46.272
It's Jenna.

40:48.074 --> 40:50.176
Emily:
And shana?

40:52.546 --> 40:54.280
Spencer:
They know Wilden?

41:01.688 --> 41:03.522
Guys...

41:03.523 --> 41:05.424
Look at the trunk.

41:09.995 --> 41:13.097
( Phones all ringing )

41:20.238 --> 41:21.439
Emily:
You're mine now.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.374
Kisses...

41:23.375 --> 41:25.609
"A."

41:35.419 --> 41:36.553
( All gasping )

41:38.322 --> 41:40.156
( Thunder )
