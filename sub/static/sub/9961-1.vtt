03:48.228 --> 03:52.522
Come on, Charlie. Stop messing
about. We really have to get down to it now.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.651
I just hope our friendship
survives the day, that's all.

03:55.693 --> 03:59.029
Oh, George,
don't be so melodramatic.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.782
Well, it's
your autobiography, Charlie.

04:01.824 --> 04:07.246
And as your editor, I have to tell you
that parts of the manuscript

04:07.330 --> 04:11.416
are pretty vague, to say the least.
I mean, for instance, your mother.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.586
Now, when did she first lose control?

04:15.004 --> 04:17.089
We need to know those facts.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.757
It's hard to say.

04:19.591 --> 04:23.679
She could be so wonderful
on her good days.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.018
Can't hear you, love!

05:11.060 --> 05:13.020
- Come on, get on with it!
- Get off!

05:13.062 --> 05:15.147
Silly woman! Get off, you silly cow!

05:20.361 --> 05:21.361
Come on, Mum!

05:21.446 --> 05:22.738
We want our money back!

05:22.905 --> 05:25.407
- Come on!
- What's the matter with you?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.575
Get off!

05:33.958 --> 05:36.126
Off! Off! Quick, lady, off!

05:36.377 --> 05:38.337
Listen, listen. Come on. Cut it out!

05:40.089 --> 05:41.089
Off!

05:41.758 --> 05:43.133
You're out of it. Finished.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.138
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen!

05:48.264 --> 05:50.515
Ladies and gentlemen,
retaining your special attention...

05:50.600 --> 05:53.310
Come on! Play the game! Play fair, lads.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.687
Play the game! Come on, lads!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.607
- Stop! Please, sir!
- Get off the stage!

05:58.941 --> 06:00.359
Get off the bloody stage!

06:00.443 --> 06:02.402
- Isn't he cute?
- We got another lovely act for you...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.946
- What?
- Mister, I know it. I can do the song.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.324
Says he knows it, let him do it!
- Let him have a go!

06:07.658 --> 06:09.409
Give the boy a chance, then!

06:10.787 --> 06:11.787
What's your name, son?

06:11.829 --> 06:13.663
- Charles.
- Charles, Charles what?

06:13.748 --> 06:15.457
- Charles Chaplin.
- Charles Chaplin.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.710
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
at very short notice and at great expense,

06:18.795 --> 06:24.132
for your special pleasure, we're delighted
to present Master Charles Chaplin.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.844
Half a mo!

06:30.807 --> 06:31.807
Ready?

07:24.527 --> 07:28.238
Your mother never sang again?
No. Never.

07:28.531 --> 07:32.659
I'm warning you, Mrs. Chaplin,
if I don't get me rent, I'll report you!

07:32.702 --> 07:35.036
Them two little mites ain't fed proper!

07:41.669 --> 07:43.920
If I don't get me rent today, I'll report you!

07:45.339 --> 07:47.174
You're two months behind!

07:48.926 --> 07:51.344
The rent? Rent?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.888
What on Earth is that?

07:53.264 --> 07:55.640
Oh, shut up, you ghastly woman!

07:58.269 --> 07:59.269
Go on, Mum.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.736
Sorry it's only fish heads again, darlings.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.703
I'll get you a plum cake one day.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.706
When my ship comes in.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.260
Mum? Someone's coming!

08:39.769 --> 08:41.269
Mrs. Chaplin?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.567
These are your children, I take it?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.489
Not the workhouse.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.282
For their own good.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.535
Stop! Come back here!

08:57.036 --> 08:58.036
Stop him!

08:59.747 --> 09:01.289
Stop, you little...

09:02.291 --> 09:04.292
Come here! We've got...

09:04.877 --> 09:06.461
Come here, you little...

09:08.923 --> 09:10.549
We've got him!

09:23.020 --> 09:25.480
Syd!

09:26.399 --> 09:27.774
Syd!

09:28.693 --> 09:30.777
Now, then. Up you go.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.112
Syd!

09:34.031 --> 09:37.450
Get off! Put me down! Let me go!
Let go of me.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.785
You were beaten?

09:38.828 --> 09:40.870
With a cane as thick
as a man's thumb.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.455
And Syd?

09:42.498 --> 09:45.000
Sent to a training ship.
Then to sea.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.671
You don't tell us how long you
spent in the workhouse, or how you got out.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.507
I don't? That's a mistake.
I was there for a year.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.385
Um, my mother started taking in piecework.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.804
Sewing gloves.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.558
So, while you were growing up,
it was just the two of you.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.395
- Your father?
What about my father?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.732
Well, he died during that period,
didn't he? When you were 12.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.234
- You don't write very much about him.
I don't know very much about him.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.695
He left just after I was born,
he sang on the stage, he died of drink.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.655
What else should I say?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.199
Well, this is your book
we're talking about, Charlie.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.535
It's your life. It's up to you.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.752
Hold your horse, gov.
Hold your horse, gov.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.588
What's up, Rummy?
All the booze gone down to your feet?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.506
- Don't you give me that lip, Charlie.
Come on.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.593
All right, clear off out of here!
Go on, go on. Now!

10:36.677 --> 10:38.053
Didn't mean no harm.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.475
Watch you, Lil.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.768
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.852
Hello, love.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.569
Hi, Charlie. Know what?
Your mum's gone mad again!

10:55.321 --> 10:56.571
Get off!

11:45.746 --> 11:46.746
Mum?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.459
Thank God you got here, Charlie!

11:52.503 --> 11:55.463
I got you that plum cake, just like I said.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.344
Thanks, Mum.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.490
Make your mark, son,
if you can't sign.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.827
The parish doctor said to bring her here.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.497
Well, she'll be better off.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.877
- What about you, son?
- I'll be fine.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.338
- What do you mean, "fine"?
- I'll stay with me aunty.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.175
You watch your feet, mister!
Shoes cost money!

12:41.385 --> 12:44.053
Sometimes she thinks
the floor is the River Jordan.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.517
- We won't get wet, Mum.
- Yes, we'll do our best.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.063
Why don't you say goodbye
to her now, sonny?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.109
- Charlie!
- Wasn't thinking, Mum.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.210
- Mum, I love you so much.
- I know, I know.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.423
If only you'd given me a cup of tea,
I'd have been all right.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.258
They'll take better care of you
than I can, Mum.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.596
One cup of tea!
You must have wanted to get rid of me bad.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.932
I didn't, Mum. I really didn't.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.520
- Come along, dear.
- You're a lying little runt.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.024
You're gonna end up just like your father.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.243
Charlie? Don't do this to me.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.956
I love you, Charlie.
Don't let them take me away from you!

13:53.457 --> 13:55.708
No, you can't
let them do this to me!

13:56.502 --> 13:59.212
Don't let them do this to me, Charlie!

14:00.589 --> 14:04.509
Don't let them take me away from you!
Charlie!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.554
Why are you doing this?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.128
Was you scared, Syd?
First time you met this Karno geezer?

14:40.212 --> 14:44.799
Every bugger's scared. And it's
Mr. Karno to the likes of you, remember.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.342
If you wanna be in vaudeville,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.720
you don't work for him,
you don't work for nobody. Got it?

14:48.804 --> 14:49.804
Yes.

14:50.931 --> 14:55.768
Now, look, if you get this job,
and with what I'm bringing in,

14:57.104 --> 14:59.564
we can move Mum somewhere better.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.569
- Don't let me down.
- I'll be great, Syd.

15:04.653 --> 15:08.656
You don't have to be great.
Just shut up and be funny.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.453
- Morning, Mr. Karno.
- Hello, Sydney. Come on over.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.914
- All right.
- We've got summat to eat.

15:15.998 --> 15:16.998
Ta.

15:17.499 --> 15:22.086
Now, then,
what about this young brother of yours?

15:22.838 --> 15:25.423
Well, you know,
he's been legit up to now, Mr. Karno.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.134
But he sings and he dances a treat.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.845
Sydney, Sydney.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.808
I've got song and dance men like you
coming out of me ears.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.226
I need comics.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.772
Yeah, well, his slapstick is fantastic.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.858
You know, he's got the knack. Watch him.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.929
He can do more, you know. More stuff.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.225
I hope so.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.910
Bloody hell!

16:42.251 --> 16:44.502
- You all right, kid?
- Yes.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.170
Need the job that bad, eh?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.422
Yes, sir.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.090
You know what comedy is?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.592
Knowing who you are
and where you come from.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.721
- And it's got to be perfection.
- Yes, sir.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.641
- Can I come out now?
- You may.

17:07.108 --> 17:12.155
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been
a great evening so far, hasn't it?

17:13.406 --> 17:17.492
Well, I promise you,
you are going to love the next act.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.622
Everybody loves elephants.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.002
And, right here on our stage,

17:26.086 --> 17:31.174
you will see 20 of the largest,
most graceful specimens.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.302
These are straight from the jungle.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.263
Do you mind, sir?

17:37.306 --> 17:39.557
I'm trying to introduce
our dancing elephants.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.935
Do please take your seat, sir.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.855
Sit down, sir!

17:58.994 --> 18:00.495
Take your feet down, sir!

18:00.829 --> 18:02.163
Show a little respect!

18:02.206 --> 18:06.709
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a very big round of applause

18:06.919 --> 18:09.003
for our next act!

18:10.172 --> 18:13.966
Captain Boytom
and his pulchritudinous pachyderms!

18:20.182 --> 18:22.809
Oh, no, really, sir! This is too much.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.817
Kindly remember, sir,
this is a place of entertainment,

18:32.069 --> 18:37.532
not a four-ale bar
or a rest home for inebriates!

18:42.204 --> 18:45.289
Now, sit down and behave yourself.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.518
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Charles Chaplin!

20:01.366 --> 20:02.366
Good evening.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.327
Ladies and gentlemen,
for your continuing enjoyment...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.666
- How do, cookie?
- All right, dearie?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.627
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Laurie love.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.004
- Hear your governor's in tonight.
- Yeah, I saw him.

20:21.970 --> 20:22.970
Hello, love.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.556
Hey, Charlie, come and do me up,
will you, love?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.016
I'm that late!

20:31.104 --> 20:32.813
I'm never going to make it.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.196
So, when did it start?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.491
This afternoon. He's only four.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.327
I thought he'd cough his little heart out.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.163
It could be the croup.
You should call a doctor.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.831
I can't afford no doctor!

20:51.333 --> 20:52.792
Yankee Doodles,
five minutes, please!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.877
Just give him a bit
and say you'll pay the rest later.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.004
Come on, girls, you'll be off.
Get a move on!

20:57.673 --> 20:58.839
Can't get this blasted thing
to close.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.344
Here, Charlie, my Harry was in last night.
He thought you were hysterical!

21:04.930 --> 21:07.682
- Charlie, now, how do I look?
- Fine. Yeah, fine.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.559
You're a good boy, Charlie.
Saved my bacon.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.978
Stupid...

21:22.406 --> 21:23.864
What are you doing in here?

21:25.951 --> 21:26.951
The others don't mind.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.869
Well, I do!

21:30.580 --> 21:31.789
You must be new.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.334
I'm going to complain. I'll tell Mr. Karno.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.715
- Dirty, little good-for-nothing.
- Lips.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.258
What?

21:43.719 --> 21:44.719
Lips.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.596
Oh, no.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.393
Here.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.897
I'm still going to complain.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.739
Ta.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.283
Well, thanks, I suppose.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.660
Last again?

22:23.759 --> 22:24.925
Good evening, my lady.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.219
- Evening, my Lord.
Evening, Joe.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.437
Here, give us your coat.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.314
- Thank you.
- Coat, sir?

22:39.066 --> 22:40.232
- Thank you, madam.
- Thank you.

22:41.902 --> 22:42.902
And your hat, sir.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.487
Go! Look the other way.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.780
Oi!

22:47.157 --> 22:51.327
Hello, hello, who's out on the town, then?

22:51.745 --> 22:54.872
- Evening, Governor.
- And in my tails, at that!

22:54.956 --> 22:55.956
Mrs. Karno.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.793
Don't go spilling nothing down your front,
my lad.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.753
Cost me good money, did that suit.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.966
Ah, Fred, you are a one.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.968
You want to watch him, darling.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.304
This time tomorrow, be on the high seas.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.683
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.315
Cor blimey.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.151
Good evening. I booked a table.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.529
Name of Chaplin.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.163
I booked it a week ago.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.500
There's nothing here, sir.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.004
We're fully booked.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.675
There must be some error.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.690
I really did book that table. You know?

24:02.858 --> 24:04.024
I know.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.237
You know,
it's 'cause that geezer's seen us with Karno.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.657
And they won't have theatricals
in them fancy places.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.536
You wait. Someday they'll beg.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.540
Yeah, we'll walk in there, you and me.

24:21.168 --> 24:25.379
You in a fur, dripping jewels,
me in me own whistle.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.466
- Whistle?
- Yeah, whistle and flute. Suit.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.050
Oh. I see.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.396
Will you marry me?

24:47.277 --> 24:48.277
No.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.572
I mean, where would I get
the jewels, anyway?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.073
From me, you know.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.619
Engagement rings, wedding tiaras, rubies,
diamonds, pearls, emeralds...

24:56.703 --> 24:59.455
Charlie, I can't marry you.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.252
I can't think of any reason why not.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.133
Well, I'm only 16.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.929
Yeah, well, you know, you get older.
Why else?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.014
Well, we hardly know each other.

25:17.098 --> 25:20.809
This is the first time we spent
more than a couple of minutes together.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.938
All right, well, when I get back from America,
we'll spend more time together.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.231
Why else?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.107
Charlie, are you serious?

25:29.152 --> 25:30.444
Well, were you, Charlie?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.240
'Cause you say you were.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.451
I just want to make sure you got down
exactly what you meant. That's all.

25:37.577 --> 25:40.996
- It's on page 40-something.
-33.

25:42.749 --> 25:43.749
Yes.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.794
I mean, you never even kissed her.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.422
You think I don't know that?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.971
Okay, I'll just backtrack for a moment. Um...

25:57.722 --> 26:00.891
After you had your mother committed
to the asylum,

26:01.309 --> 26:02.643
it all gets a bit vague.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.812
- Don't you think?
- Yes, it does.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.647
Why is that?

26:06.731 --> 26:09.233
Because I don't wish to remember it.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.069
All right, fair enough.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.282
But if you'll allow me to say so, Charlie,

26:16.324 --> 26:19.952
I don't think, and I know
this will sound very American,

26:19.995 --> 26:24.123
but you shouldn't be afraid to let the readers
share your emotions or your feelings.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.375
Know what I mean?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.587
You'll break me heart
if you don't marry me, Hetty.

26:30.338 --> 26:33.257
I mean, or at least say you'll wait for me.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.509
I'll wait for you.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.178
Charlie, how long are you going to be
in America?

26:38.221 --> 26:40.180
Well, I don't know. Do I? I mean, exactly.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.683
You know, we'll be on tour.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.184
Depends if they like the drunk act.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.645
You know, if they start throwing things,
I won't be gone long.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.689
They're not gonna throw things
at you, Charlie.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.816
They're gonna think you're wonderful.
I mean, I...

26:56.114 --> 26:58.198
I think you're wonderful.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.749
But you know what the funny thing is?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.172
You never mentioned love.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.760
Well, I don't have to, do I?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.261
Number nine, pulling in from Chicago.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.263
Let's get them steer loaded up, boys.

28:27.914 --> 28:29.289
Nickel.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.811
Sit down.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.564
Sorry.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.423
Uh... Have you seen
that English bloke? There he is.

29:21.676 --> 29:22.676
Watch this, Stanley.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.595
I've told you. I've seen it before.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.514
Here look, there's a telegram come for you.

29:30.852 --> 29:31.852
Show it again.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.146
But you've already seen everything twice.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.023
The one with the fire engine.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.983
You'll love this one, Stanley.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.195
If any of them could really act,
they'd be on stage.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.156
Charlie, look. You must listen.
It's a telegram.

29:44.365 --> 29:46.867
That can only mean somebody's died.

29:59.088 --> 30:02.049
Some bloke offering me a job in California.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.051
In the flickers.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.595
It's not legit in the flickers.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.222
$150 a week.

30:10.934 --> 30:13.060
At $150 a week!

30:33.373 --> 30:34.998
Watch your step.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.084
Bye, sir.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.040
Hit him harder, Fred!

31:17.542 --> 31:18.876
Harder!

31:19.460 --> 31:23.380
Put some effort in to it, boys!
This ain't no Sunday school picnic!

31:24.299 --> 31:26.925
That's right. Good! Again!

31:28.636 --> 31:30.012
Good, Fred.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.058
Ready when you are, Mr. Sennett.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.148
Everyone set? Okay. Begin!

31:52.493 --> 31:55.495
- There's someone in the shot.
- Keep cranking. Still cranking!

31:58.041 --> 32:00.459
Cut. Cut it! Jesus Christ!

32:02.795 --> 32:04.630
Were we good till the dummies come out?

32:04.881 --> 32:07.674
Excuse me, miss? Can you tell me
where I could find Mr. Mack Sennett?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.469
What the hell do you think you're doing?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.722
I'm afraid you just found him.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.475
How do you do, sir. I'm Charlie Chaplin.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.604
Chaplin. You sent me a telegram.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.940
Butte, Montana.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.400
You've hired me for a year, Mr. Sennett.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.069
You can't be Chaplin.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.154
The guy I hired did
the best comedy drunk I ever saw.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.781
But he was old.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.532
I don't pay $100 a week to juveniles.

32:32.992 --> 32:34.910
Another one, boss?
No, we'll move on.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.620
Mr. Sennett?

33:39.600 --> 33:40.809
Okay.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.354
You might be Chaplin after all.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.610
Oh. It was $150, Mr. Sennett.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.243
Plum in the middle of the shot.
See?

33:58.786 --> 34:01.788
You really screwed it up,
didn't you, Chaplin?

34:03.416 --> 34:05.417
Fix it, will you, Rollie?

34:08.129 --> 34:10.255
We don't print till we cut it.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.216
That was negative, kid.

34:13.801 --> 34:17.094
Now, I know this is all new to you.
But remember something, we're all new.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.804
This is not an ancient industry.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.891
This whole place here is built around speed.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.893
Start the story, start the chase.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.143
I get bored easy, is why.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.813
How much do you reckon, Mack?
A couple of yards of Mabel?

34:27.482 --> 34:30.859
Yeah. No, make it three.
But don't go thinking we sacrifice quality.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.277
I never make more than
two motion pictures a week.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.822
But I'll spend up to $1, 000 on each of them
if I have to.

34:37.992 --> 34:38.992
How we doing there, Rollie?

34:39.368 --> 34:40.869
In a moment, boss.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.871
"Waste not, want not. "
That's my motto, son.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.002
When Rollie's done, no one will ever know
you were on that dirt road at all.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.504
Just rewinding.

34:52.047 --> 34:55.382
You're on the cutting room floor, Chaplin.
Not the place to be.

34:55.635 --> 34:56.676
Got it.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.847
Go ahead, kid.

35:00.932 --> 35:05.352
Just forget everything you ever learned.
You're not in the theater anymore.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.203
Yeah, that did it.

35:24.705 --> 35:27.040
Thanks, Rollie.
If you need me, I'll be with Mabel.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.626
- Good night, sir.
Good night, boss.

35:53.359 --> 35:55.652
Nothing quite like it.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.321
The feeling of film.

35:58.406 --> 36:02.117
But have I made it clear
how much the movies terrified me?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.743
No, not really. Why?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.912
Oh, well, you've got to help me get that right.

36:05.997 --> 36:09.416
Nevertheless, I was right to be frightened.
I was dreadful at the beginning.

36:09.458 --> 36:13.295
Sennett wished he'd never hired me.
It was all I could do to keep control.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.088
Mario, grazie.

36:15.923 --> 36:20.510
The truth is I'd have been a total disaster
if I hadn't invented The Tramp.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.930
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about
the way you've written that.

36:24.015 --> 36:27.934
I mean, the words just poured out.
It practically wrote itself.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.438
Remember, I'd only been with Sennett
for a month.

36:32.940 --> 36:37.485
Oh, that magical moment as I walked through
the wardrobe door.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.782
I felt possessed.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.954
I could feel him calling out to me.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.124
The Tramp.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.301
Bullshit. And you know it.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.803
But the truth was
so boring, George.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.863
Jesus.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.490
You told him to get changed, remember?

37:23.532 --> 37:26.243
What's he putting on? A suit of armor?

37:41.217 --> 37:44.844
Chaplin! Chaplin!

37:44.887 --> 37:47.889
Get your ass on to the stage, right now!

38:15.918 --> 38:18.211
Forget the little limey.
Get cranking, Rollie.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.714
Okay! Begin!

38:22.633 --> 38:24.634
Very formal, everybody.

38:30.891 --> 38:31.933
What the hell?

38:32.018 --> 38:33.643
He's gone crazy.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.773
What do I do? What do I do?

38:38.858 --> 38:41.735
Cut it. No, wait, wait. Hold it. Keep it going.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.863
Maybe he's not so crazy after all.
Photographer!

38:44.905 --> 38:47.240
Henry, chase him around the camera!

38:49.744 --> 38:53.830
Okay, put him in line.
Big reaction! Big reaction! Who is this?

38:55.791 --> 38:58.501
Stay down, Henry. Stay down!

38:58.586 --> 39:00.879
Groom! Look jealous! Jealous!

39:00.921 --> 39:02.464
You can do better than that, can't you?

39:02.548 --> 39:06.009
Bride. Mabel, give the tramp the eye.
That's right.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.469
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:07.553 --> 39:12.098
Matron, you're real hoity-toity.
Who is this bum? Good. Very good!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.435
Groom, get mad.
He's trying to spoon your lovely bride!

39:17.938 --> 39:19.898
Matron, take a swing at him!

39:20.524 --> 39:23.109
All right! Domino fall! Domino fall!

39:24.445 --> 39:25.779
Into the chase! Into the chase!

39:32.495 --> 39:34.621
Bunched up! Keep it bunched up!

40:15.538 --> 40:17.622
Good! Good! Terrific!

40:24.797 --> 40:26.464
Look at the camera.

40:27.758 --> 40:28.800
Henry, snap it.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.010
Watch the birdie.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.680
That's enough. Cut.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.558
God damn you, Chaplin!
What are you trying to do to me?

40:37.601 --> 40:40.145
I knew I was right to hire that kid.

40:43.816 --> 40:44.858
Listen.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.862
Charlie, you do what I say
or I'll report you to Mack.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.783
You stand up right now, pick up this hose

40:53.868 --> 40:56.536
and when I say, "Begin,"
you sprinkle the road.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.122
I could do a lot more with that hose
than sprinkle the road.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.498
I could be funny.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.918
Two months and you think
you know everything.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.045
Look, Charlie, I'm the director.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.257
And this is not a picture about
being funny with a hose.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.886
You're right. But it could be.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.391
Chaplin!

41:19.268 --> 41:21.102
All right, everyone.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.480
Everyone in wardrobe.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.773
Head back to the stage.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.901
We need to hurry, please.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.071
Let's keep moving.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.907
Mabel, he's on his way.

41:33.949 --> 41:37.452
I'm not insisting that you fire him
but if you want to, that's fine with me.

41:37.536 --> 41:39.579
I love you, honey,
and I'd love to ax the little limey,

41:39.663 --> 41:41.915
- but they called me from New York.
- And?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.416
It seems he's an asset to the company.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.001
But now, don't you worry.
I'll scare him good.

41:45.085 --> 41:48.713
You're a great director
and I'll make damn sure he knows that.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.051
Would you hurry, please?

41:53.594 --> 41:56.262
Is Mack ever waiting for you.

41:56.805 --> 42:00.099
All right, everyone! We don't have all day!

42:06.607 --> 42:07.607
Come in!

42:08.901 --> 42:11.778
Charlie, come in. Please come in.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.614
You got to help me with Mabel.
She actually thinks she can direct.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.241
Have a seat. Have a seat.

42:16.408 --> 42:19.285
Oh. You're not mad, then?

42:19.328 --> 42:22.622
I've been sitting here waiting for
an actor with the guts to stand up to her.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.249
How could I be mad?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.628
I really like you, Charlie.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.964
I really like you, too, Mack.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.633
And I bet you've been talking to New York.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.929
Let me direct the next one.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.556
What makes you think you can do it?

42:39.723 --> 42:41.808
- I couldn't do any worse.
- Says you.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.062
Says I, "What if nobody wants it?
What if it stinks? Who'll pay?"

42:46.605 --> 42:48.189
I've never seen you pick up a check.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.235
I'll pay.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.698
This is my work.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.952
Did you ever have to pay up?

43:00.995 --> 43:03.788
No. But, boy, did I work.

43:03.831 --> 43:07.458
I directed more than 20 films
before the year was out.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.669
Well, why on Earth
didn't you send for Hetty, then?

43:09.712 --> 43:12.422
I did write. Never got a reply.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.508
Thought maybe she was away on tour.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.511
So I asked Syd to track her down for me.
See how she felt.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.309
Oh, my God! Look at him!

43:39.491 --> 43:40.575
This is Minnie.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.994
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello.

43:44.204 --> 43:45.204
Nice to meet you.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.289
- You, too.
I'll take that.

43:46.832 --> 43:49.000
Give us a hand, then, Chas, come on.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.252
What did you pick him for?

43:51.337 --> 43:53.046
Oh, he's not so bad.

43:53.088 --> 43:55.089
- Yeah, our Syd's all right.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.884
I don't know, Chas.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.428
I don't see anybody staring at you.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.766
Nice little flivver, Chas.
How long you had it?

44:04.850 --> 44:05.892
A couple of weeks.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.852
How soon do I get to see Mr. Sennett?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.480
Got something to show you first.

44:14.234 --> 44:15.943
Get a load of that!

44:16.612 --> 44:18.404
I don't believe it!

44:18.989 --> 44:21.074
It's happened so quick, Chas.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.660
Twelve months ago,
you were still in vaudeville.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.828
I'm top of the bill, Syd.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.290
Yeah? Well, I still haven't seen
anybody staring at you.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.626
Yeah, that's 'cause I don't look like me.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.420
- Syd?
- What?

44:35.714 --> 44:37.882
- What news?
- Mum?

44:39.426 --> 44:40.968
Mum is fine.

44:42.179 --> 44:45.431
Well, no.
Not fine but there are lots of good days.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.685
Well, not lots of, but some.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.605
And Hetty. Does she know?

44:53.607 --> 44:56.401
The whole world knows about you, Charlie.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.570
She gave me this for you.

45:02.199 --> 45:03.324
Fancy Hetty writing.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.617
Yeah.

45:09.456 --> 45:10.581
Syd!

45:10.958 --> 45:12.417
Look at this.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.506
She got married.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.216
I know.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.468
I'm not surprised. A girl like Hetty.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.764
I wish her lots of happiness.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.310
Well, not lots. But some.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.855
Chin up, kid.

45:36.692 --> 45:40.319
See, I was right.
He's the most famous man in the world.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.705
Value for money is all we're after,
Mr. Sennett.

45:52.583 --> 45:55.752
Charlie, take this guy back to the asylum.

45:59.381 --> 46:00.965
Look, Syd's me manager now.

46:01.008 --> 46:03.301
He's given up his acting career
to handle me full time.

46:03.677 --> 46:08.055
Oh, woe is me!
The theater will never be the same.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.309
What career?
1, 000 a week is more than I get.

46:11.852 --> 46:16.230
Charlie's name is bigger, Mr. Sennett.
If you'll pardon me for saying so.

46:16.356 --> 46:21.027
Charlie, Charlie, I've been so rotten to you!

46:21.069 --> 46:23.780
I don't know if you can forgive me.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.783
I forced you to leave Butte, Montana.

46:27.075 --> 46:29.786
I made you accept $150 per.

46:30.829 --> 46:34.499
You mentioned directing
and I stuffed that down your throat, too.

46:34.541 --> 46:37.960
Now, tell me how else
Uncle Mack can make it up to you!

46:41.215 --> 46:44.091
I want to run me own show, Mack.
I want control.

46:46.887 --> 46:50.681
Dream on, kid. I know this business.
And you're not that big.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.228
First time I've seen you miss, Mack.

46:58.524 --> 47:02.026
But, Charlie, Mack Sennett
was the absolute king of comedy.

47:02.736 --> 47:04.779
He gave you your start.

47:04.863 --> 47:07.406
And how could you
just walk out and leave him flat?

47:07.491 --> 47:10.409
The reasons were
purely intellectual. Money.

47:12.621 --> 47:15.915
So, you joined up with
"Bronco Billy" Anderson,

47:15.958 --> 47:17.750
a puffed-up cowboy star.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.754
Not one of the high points of my career.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.840
But I knew I wanted my own studio.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.926
Even then,
I was putting money aside to build one.

47:29.596 --> 47:30.721
Excuse me, miss.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.765
Do you always eat alone?

47:33.475 --> 47:35.685
Only when I'm trying
to make a new acquaintance.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.272
Actually, I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.775
Actually, I'm a motion picture director.

47:43.110 --> 47:46.112
And I'm forming a new company
with Bronco Billy over there.

47:48.574 --> 47:51.409
And you're looking for a new leading lady.

47:51.785 --> 47:52.869
Lucky me.

47:53.161 --> 47:55.121
Obviously, you are an actress, Miss...

47:55.789 --> 47:58.916
Purviance. Sorry, just a secretary.

48:01.044 --> 48:03.796
Don't be sorry. I'm auditioning for
actresses who aren't actresses.

48:05.382 --> 48:09.802
Well, if you're on the lookout for untalented
actresses who aren't actresses,

48:09.845 --> 48:12.805
then you couldn't do better than me.
Worse than me.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.316
Don't you want to know who I am?

48:24.109 --> 48:26.319
I have no interest whatsoever
in who you are,

48:28.947 --> 48:29.989
Mr. Chaplin.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.210
Cut! Not great. Uh...

48:44.796 --> 48:46.422
We'll do another.

48:47.174 --> 48:50.426
Charlie, if I eat one more bean,
I'm going to be sick.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.428
You almost had it.

48:52.512 --> 48:56.807
But this time not quite so daintily.
You're starving.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.018
I know.

48:59.353 --> 49:02.521
But it's hard to be hungry after 46 takes.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.774
Of course it is.
No else one could do it this well.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.108
We both know it.

49:07.819 --> 49:09.695
- I'll do my best.
- Right.

49:10.113 --> 49:12.823
How about dinner tonight? Chili con carne.

49:14.993 --> 49:16.327
I'll kill you, Charlie.

49:16.536 --> 49:17.745
More beans.

49:17.829 --> 49:19.121
More beans!

49:19.706 --> 49:20.706
Camera!

49:22.876 --> 49:24.043
Action!

50:18.765 --> 50:21.267
That's all for today, folks.

50:25.397 --> 50:29.108
Good to know I can always
count on my nearest and dearest.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.944
Don't come it with me, son.

50:33.363 --> 50:37.491
"Arrival in the land of liberty"?
Sticking in the statue like that?

50:37.576 --> 50:39.410
What are you playing at?

50:40.620 --> 50:42.747
Nobody else seemed to mind.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.458
Answer me!

50:45.500 --> 50:48.127
Kicking an immigration officer
up the backside.

50:48.587 --> 50:49.754
Do you think that's funny?

50:50.464 --> 50:54.133
Well, for those of us with
a sense of humor, very.

50:54.926 --> 50:55.926
Charlie.

50:56.636 --> 51:00.639
Charlie, it was supposed to be a comedy.

51:01.183 --> 51:04.477
Now, you've turned it
into a bloody political tract.

51:04.519 --> 51:05.686
We're guests here!

51:06.104 --> 51:08.647
And you can't go around criticizing
the way it's run.

51:09.399 --> 51:12.818
Syd, I love this country. I owe it everything.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.862
That's precisely why I can criticize it.

51:14.946 --> 51:16.197
- Don't forget...
- Why I must.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.990
...where we're from.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.659
There's a war on, remember?

51:22.996 --> 51:26.665
Now, you make a million a year
while British boys are dying in France.

51:26.750 --> 51:30.920
The London papers are already after you.
Do you want the same thing to happen here?

51:31.004 --> 51:33.672
I registered for the draft,
and they never called me.

51:33.757 --> 51:37.093
- Oh, for Christ's sake...
- It isn't as if I'm hard to find.

51:38.678 --> 51:42.306
Look, I'm on your side, kid.

51:43.225 --> 51:45.351
First one on board, remember?

51:46.728 --> 51:48.312
Be careful, Chas.

51:49.815 --> 51:50.898
Just watch it.

51:54.361 --> 51:56.237
That's all I'm saying.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.458
There.

52:33.441 --> 52:35.776
You always said
you detested studio parties.

52:35.861 --> 52:37.570
Oh! The worst,

52:37.654 --> 52:40.281
but not where
Doug Fairbanks was concerned.

52:40.365 --> 52:42.616
Life was fun when Doug was around.

52:43.410 --> 52:47.580
As you know, I don't think anyone today
remembers what a huge star he was.

52:48.456 --> 52:51.667
I mean, back in the silent days, he was huge.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.627
Men liked him,

52:53.753 --> 52:56.130
women adored him.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.717
He was royalty.

53:03.471 --> 53:05.764
Charles!

53:06.933 --> 53:09.351
Look out below!

53:19.946 --> 53:22.615
Sire, you are most truly welcome.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.327
What a great party, Doug.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.370
- Isnâ€™t it fabulous?
- Wonderful.

53:28.455 --> 53:31.123
- Thank you.
May I take your coat, sir?

53:32.959 --> 53:35.920
First class. Bet I hate it more than you do.

53:35.962 --> 53:37.046
I doubt it.

53:39.466 --> 53:41.425
Of course
everything changed when

53:41.468 --> 53:43.844
America's sweetheart came on the scene.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.430
You mean Mary Pickford?

53:46.473 --> 53:50.517
Yes, I always found her to be
something of an undersized bitch,

53:50.602 --> 53:53.604
but Doug fell for her like a ton of bricks.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.399
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Mary.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.651
- Hi, Doug.
- Hello.

53:58.735 --> 53:59.777
Thanks for inviting me.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.905
Mary, it's a pleasure.

54:05.825 --> 54:08.953
Duty calls. Excuse me.

54:12.499 --> 54:15.042
He's a really lovely person, Charlie.

54:15.126 --> 54:17.169
Yes. Hungry?

54:22.008 --> 54:24.009
Hello, Charlie.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.321
Her name is Mildred Harris.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.698
An actress?

54:45.782 --> 54:49.034
Oh, yeah. A child actress.

54:49.869 --> 54:52.371
You ever hear the word "jailbait," Charlie?

54:52.414 --> 54:55.708
That's the definition.
I'd watch it if I was you.

54:56.042 --> 54:57.668
I value that, Mary.

55:02.590 --> 55:04.258
Coming from you.

55:04.634 --> 55:08.262
When America's own sweetheart
gives you advice, you'd better listen.

55:08.346 --> 55:11.348
"Better listen?" Thanks, Charlie.

55:12.017 --> 55:14.184
Especially since you're married
and Doug's married,

55:14.227 --> 55:17.229
and the two of you are rutting
with each other every afternoon

55:17.272 --> 55:19.398
- all the time pretending you've just met.
- Miss Pickford,

55:19.524 --> 55:21.066
Mr. Chaplin, please?

55:21.192 --> 55:23.068
Lecture me more about morality.

55:26.573 --> 55:29.992
Better. Better. Better.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.911
Bitch. Better.

55:50.263 --> 55:51.597
I washed my face.

55:53.683 --> 55:54.683
Come here.

56:14.454 --> 56:15.454
Charlie, what is it?

56:17.749 --> 56:21.752
I just need some...
You just need some lip rouge.

56:24.464 --> 56:25.631
I've got some in my purse.

56:26.716 --> 56:29.802
It's in the drawer, over there. It's top right.

56:51.616 --> 56:52.699
Look at me.

56:55.787 --> 56:56.995
Is this what you want?

56:57.914 --> 57:00.499
Yeah. Just put it on.

57:50.758 --> 57:52.926
My God, Charlie!
You weren't even 30.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.720
You were the most famous man in the world.

57:55.013 --> 57:59.266
You had your own studio, named after you.
I mean, couldn't you just enjoy?

57:59.684 --> 58:01.560
Mmm. I can, now.

58:01.644 --> 58:04.605
But I couldn't then. It meant too much.

58:11.738 --> 58:12.738
Morning.

58:22.790 --> 58:24.416
Mr. Chaplin, welcome.

58:39.265 --> 58:40.599
Welcome, Charlie!

58:45.146 --> 58:47.272
Take your picture, Charlie?

58:48.274 --> 58:49.274
Chaplin.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.468
Cut!
All right. Hold it.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.762
I think, perhaps,
we should try a little less next time.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.431
Hold it.
Hold the smoke.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:06.184
The dirt, I mean. For God's sake,
somebody get me out of this thing.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.148
Looks great, Charlie.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.985
But I thought I better keep the boys here
under control till you got out of costume.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.696
- You are an ass!
- Thank you.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.781
That wasn't bad, Charlie. One more?

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:21.658
Check it.
- How's the light, Rollie?

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:25.245
- I know. It's better down at Barney's Bar.
It's better down at Barney's Bar.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.663
Call it a day.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.877
- I don't feel funny anymore.
- Come on, Charlie, let's go.

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.129
Not cheating are you, Fairbanks?

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:37.549
You are a truly strange fellow, Charles.

01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:40.594
- Nonsense.
- Facts indicate otherwise.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.638
Close, but out.

01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:47.225
And these facts show a young man,
of what, 29?

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.604
Not perhaps conventionally handsome,
but certainly not repellent.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.983
Flatteringly put.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.236
Double fault. Lucky me.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:04.034
Yes, an unrepellant fellow of some fame
and fortune, not totally without talent.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.077
Ready?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.079
If only you'd put one in play.

01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:09.581
Call this one out.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.291
Don't have to, I'm winning.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:14.628
Damn.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.755
And who is this fellow escorting?

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.548
Why, Mildred Harris?

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.593
That intellectual giant of 16
who still sucks her thumb.

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:23.762
That's very funny.

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.722
Then why aren't you laughing?

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.267
Perhaps because I'm marrying her.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.322
She's really not that bad.

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.199
"Really not that bad"?

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:47.994
Spoken like a man desperately in love.

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:51.123
You're madder even than I thought, Charles.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:55.836
You sure it's yours?

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:58.296
I can only hope.

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:02.551
There are ways of getting out of this.
You know, all it takes is money.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:06.138
Where I come from, that's not an option.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.017
Besides, I want a family and...

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:13.812
I predict you're going to have one
before you know it.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.023
May I be the first to congratulate you?

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.109
You may not!

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:21.903
Good!

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.872
You didn't suspect about Mildred?

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.166
Not for a moment.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.169
Well, why don't you add that?
Put that in?

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.923
I'll never forget the night
Mary told me the truth.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:44.676
We were celebrating the end
of the First World War.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.846
And I met J. Edgar Hoover for the first time.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.264
Then I think
you should make it clear

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:52.100
that this was before
he became head of the FBI.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.269
If I may continue, Mr. Hearst.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.687
We're too generous.

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:58.106
We're too open.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.649
Now, if we don't watch out,

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:04.905
if we don't take steps now to impose
some new discipline, some decency,

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:08.533
then we're in trouble. Deep trouble.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:11.953
I know it's not fashionable to say this.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.706
We're celebrating. Everyone thinks it's over.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.043
- But democracy carries a price tag.
Hear, hear.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.296
And I just happen to think
that one of the most

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.049
misguided promises we ever made

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.552
was inscribed on the base
of the Statue of Liberty.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:31.765
One that I predict will lead this country
into all kinds of trouble.

01:03:32.683 --> 01:03:36.061
"Give us your poor, your huddled masses. "

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:39.064
Now, we have to stop this
before it goes too far.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.984
Our conception of America
does not include,

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.403
was never meant to include,
this kind of scum.

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:51.827
You will have to forgive our famous,
young friends, the artistic temperament.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:55.038
But what you're saying is important,
very important.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:09.261
Right now we are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.264
All kinds of left-wing intellectuals

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.724
who'd like nothing more
than to bring us down.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:17.519
Don't you think you're overstating?

01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:18.937
No, sir. I do not.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:22.399
And I sometimes wonder if you people
realize the responsibility you carry.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.110
To my way of thinking,

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:27.404
motion pictures are, potentially,

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:30.156
the most influential form of communication
ever invented.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.450
And there's no control over them.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:35.245
Your message reaches
everyone, everywhere.

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:36.830
Message?

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:38.456
Of course.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:42.460
Mr. Chaplin here reaches millions
who only have to see.

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:46.631
And when they see a mockery being made
of our immigration services,

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.050
I call that a message.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.176
Yes. Well,

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:55.974
as you've already said, Mr. Hoover,
motion pictures are for the people.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:05:00.145
Most of the people work for a living
and they don't make much money doing it.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:03.315
It gives them pleasure to see officialdom
and the upper classes

01:05:03.357 --> 01:05:05.567
getting a kick up the backside.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:08.153
Always has and it always will.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:12.032
And if that can change things,
so much the better.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.327
Better.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.622
He's improving.

01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:20.832
But motion pictures have made you rich,
Mr. Chaplin.

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.835
They sure have.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:28.423
What about your own
motion picture career, Mrs. Chaplin?

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:31.176
- I think you've handled it all wonderfully.
- What?

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:32.886
Mildred.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.347
The pregnancy?

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.976
Everyone knows
you've been conned, Charlie.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.357
Mildred.

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:51.863
Please excuse us, Mr. Hearst.
I have to be up very early.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:54.532
- Yes, of course.
- Come along, my dear.

01:05:59.538 --> 01:06:01.373
It's been a pleasure.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.793
Good night.

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:14.511
You made an enemy there, Charlie.

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.889
Was it personal, do you think?

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:20.058
Personal? Maybe.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:23.395
But I'm sure he really did believe
I was a communist.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:26.731
I wasn't, of course. I was simply a humanist.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:29.109
He also believed you were a Jew.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:33.697
Something I've rarely troubled
to deny, mainly because of Syd.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.993
He's half-Jewish, as you know.
Same mother, different fathers.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.998
I suppose the false pregnancy
was the beginning of the end with Mildred.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:59.180
You're awful late again, Charlie.
I'd almost given up on you.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.348
Funny.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.435
Sometimes I feel I'm so close
to getting it right,

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.187
it slips away.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:09.149
You've been editing that film for months.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:12.527
Will be for months, more than likely.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.072
Not like the old days.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.074
The good times.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:24.080
The good times? Are they over?

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.668
Do you want me to leave?

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:31.463
No.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:35.675
I'll leave.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.438
Why aren't you
more bitter towards her?

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.940
Stealing my movie wasn't her idea.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:55.653
Oh! Poor child was so stupid, I'm not sure
she could even spell the word "idea. "

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:56.696
Charlie?

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:00.492
Charlie, wake up!

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:04.537
- Charlie!
- What?

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.498
Wake up. Quick.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.749
- They're trying to seize the film.
- Who?

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.626
Just go and wash your face
and wake up, will you?

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.920
That sweet child bride of yours,

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:15.006
well, her divorce lawyers have informed her
it's an asset.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:16.966
- An asset?
- Yes.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.803
So, I've got Rollie, the wife

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.430
- and 40 cans of film in the car. Come on.
- Okay.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.890
Once we're over the state line,

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:26.518
we keep you under wraps
till we finish cutting the film.

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:29.062
Charlie, you've got your pants on
back to front.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.830
Yeah, yeah. It's good.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.585
It moves now.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.760
I really do love that kid.

01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:12.707
We're still waiting for that other shot, Syd.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:16.127
- Have a look in 102, Rollie.
- Sure I put it on there.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.004
Wait. No, Chas, I've got it here.

01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:22.926
Minnie, answer the door. Hurry up.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:26.429
Charlie.

01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:38.691
- Here's your tea, ma'am.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.944
Thank you.

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:45.406
He's on to us, boys.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.637
They're...
They're here, boss.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:36.768
I've dreamed of this moment for years.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.608
This is America, Mum.
This is where your dreams come true.

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:54.660
Charlie's bought you a lovely house, Mum.

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.080
It's not too big.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.165
Great view of the ocean.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.803
You always wanted
to live by the seaside, didn't you?

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.310
Don't stop, Syd. You're right. I have.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.148
I think I shall love watching the waves.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:31.614
I'm sure I will. You boys, you spoil me so.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:50.675
More tea, dear?

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:52.343
No.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.303
Mum. Mum.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.682
The mark on my arm, Charles?

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.393
They gave me that at the asylum.

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:08.192
If only I'd been able to feed you proper,
I'd never have gone there.

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:15.533
Now, if they ever come back for me,
I'll have enough food for us all.

01:14:25.043 --> 01:14:27.503
I never could deal with my mother.

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:30.214
I only ever threw money at her.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.884
Come on, Charlie,
you've got to explain

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.303
why you chose that particular time
to go to London.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:40.266
Now, I don't have to explain a damn
thing, I was tired. I had a movie opening.

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.477
I wanted to see old friends.

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:50.526
Straight into the water, arse over tit!

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:54.113
He needed the job that bad!

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:59.577
But I was worried, Charlie.
I was prepared for the absolute worst.

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:04.874
I've seen it happen in the profession,
oh, so many times.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:07.877
Mmm, I'm sure you have, Mr. Karno.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:12.089
His head size.
That is the only true measure of a man.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:15.885
I sent this lad to America.

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:18.971
Look what's come back to me.

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:24.393
My head never swelled,
not with all my successes.

01:15:24.436 --> 01:15:28.272
I was worried about you, though, Charlie.

01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:31.859
And that other night at the Troc, remember?

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:36.489
Well, you took a tail-suit
out of the wardrobe, tried to be a gent.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.618
Trying to impress that young dancer, Hetty.

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:41.994
Wasn't that her name?

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:43.120
Hetty Kelly.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.122
I could see in your eyes you fancied her.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:48.251
Sad.

01:15:49.836 --> 01:15:52.880
Yes, I know all about it, Fred.
She got married.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.632
Sent me a lovely note.

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.426
Brought it with me.
Somewhere in my baggage.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:02.431
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.476
Charlie, don't you know?

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.146
Has nobody told you?

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:10.648
She's gone!

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:14.193
The flu epidemic after the war
carried her away.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.658
Well, I thought someone must have told you.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.869
Must have written.

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:26.122
Didn't nobody?

01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:40.761
Charlie!

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.139
Hey, hey, hey. Charlie!

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.294
What do we do, Charlie?

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.135
Smile.

01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:26.974
Give me my hat.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.590
- Evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:01.318
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.988
Hey! That's Charlie Chaplin!

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.450
Now, what can I get you?

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:11.662
- Light ale, please.
That'll be tuppence, sir.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:16.834
Well, here's someone who's had a good war!

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.919
Yeah, you didn't see him
in the bleeding army.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.214
Come to stare at the animals, Charlie?

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:25.676
Oh, go and sit down, Ted,
and give your mouth a rest.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.261
I just came in for a quiet drink.

01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:29.180
Great to see you back, Charlie.

01:19:29.222 --> 01:19:30.222
Here, have one on me.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.683
You have one on me.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:36.437
Mr. Charlie fucking Chaplin!

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.689
Ted.
Bleeding commie bastard!

01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:41.066
Go, lads, sit down.
Come, sit down. Come.

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:44.445
Don't worry about him, Charlie.
He's always been a miserable old sod.

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:46.113
Get him off the premises.

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.325
Charlie Chaplin.

01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:53.037
Well, bugger Mr. Charlie bleeding Chaplin.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.164
Good luck, Charlie!

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:57.333
- Good luck, Charlie!
- I've seen all your pictures!

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:00.461
That's him. Charlie Chaplin!

01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:04.590
The back way's through there, sir.

01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:06.300
Oh. You're very kind.

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:09.220
Good old Charlie.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:13.265
See him coming in here,
Charlie Chaplin.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:37.832
Welcome home, Charlie.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:46.257
I knew then that I had no home.
So I decided to put down roots in America.

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:03.274
Whoa, whoa.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:09.113
A man came to see me the other day.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:14.034
A corset salesman? I sent him.
Your paunch is in need of help.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.454
He was the FBI, old darling.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:20.791
Said he knew what a loyal American I was.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.544
He wondered if everyone else
felt the same way.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:27.882
I just sat there and let him work his way
around to you,

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.174
which he did.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.844
He asked were you a member
of the Communist Party.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:36.015
I said that was an absolute impossibility.

01:21:36.099 --> 01:21:37.224
Because I love America.

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:39.643
Because you're too cheap to pay the dues.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:45.065
Remarkable. Your timing in work is flawless.
In life, it's the reverse.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:48.319
You're a miserable pain in the ass, Charles.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.446
But I'm worried about you.

01:21:52.657 --> 01:21:56.243
You worry about your family jewels,
old darling.

01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.579
I'm serious.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:00.456
Watch out.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.336
What am I supposed to watch?

01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:09.965
Charles, you're a foreigner.
You're still an outsider.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:12.468
You've never understood this country.

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:14.178
It's a good country underneath, Doug.

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:18.265
No. It's a good country on top.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:23.020
Underneath, that's what starts showing
when we're scared.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:28.692
But you don't care about politics.
What is this?

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:31.236
- Why are you so worried?
- Me?

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.156
I haven't a care in the world.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:37.660
I'm the oldest action star in the business
and talkies are coming.

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:40.663
What the hell
have I got to be worried about?

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:44.458
That's talkies, Charles.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:48.170
Talkies! Talkies!

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.839
Can you imagine The Tramp talking?

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:53.008
It's the future, Charlie.

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.593
Not in my lifetime.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.220
Talkies!

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.307
It'll never catch on.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.226
Talkies!

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:04.770
Talkies!

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:09.900
Talkies! Talkies!

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:25.749
This is it, sir. We've enlarged it for you.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.755
I still can't make him out.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.676
Have you got a positive identification?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.637
Oh, yes. No doubt, sir. It is Hawkins, sir.
The red labor leader.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.265
Visiting him at the studios.

01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:44.143
How can we make them realize the danger?

01:23:44.894 --> 01:23:50.190
I told him that once, face to face,
"You can damage this country. "

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.067
He didn't get it.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:56.613
How old is this one?

01:23:57.323 --> 01:24:00.117
Well, sir, she's underage is all that matters.

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:03.287
When the baby's born,
we can go after him for statutory rape.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.830
A scandal like that would destroy him.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.750
I appreciate your zeal, Mr. Seeley,

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:11.462
but Chaplin and Miss Grey
were married in Mexico yesterday.

01:24:14.507 --> 01:24:18.802
If only he'd just sleep with them.
Everything would be so much easier.

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:22.765
Still, we must do what we can.

01:24:26.936 --> 01:24:29.104
Lita was your second wife, okay?

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:31.565
She gave you two sons, whom you adored.

01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:34.568
This book is over 500 pages long.

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:37.696
Yet, you only devote five lines to her. Why?

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.448
I hated the bitch.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.700
Oh, come on,
she was hardly more than a child.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:44.578
It can't all have been her fault, surely.

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:48.165
George, she was
a profoundly flawed human being.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.501
Well, we've got to deal
with the problem, Charlie.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:54.171
You married her. All your life,
you've bedded down with the babies.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.256
Your readers will want to understand.

01:24:56.341 --> 01:25:00.511
Where were you when she gave birth
to those two boys less than a year apart?

01:25:00.553 --> 01:25:02.346
You know where I was.

01:25:02.388 --> 01:25:05.349
I happened to be making a little film
called The Gold Rush.

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:15.192
You're a flawed human being, Charles,
just like the rest of us.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:18.070
Only, you have to address it. That's all.

01:25:19.739 --> 01:25:20.781
I mean, why are we here?

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:24.868
Why are we talking in Switzerland
and not in Southern California? Hmm?

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.790
It wasn't just
the parlor pink business, Charlie,

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:33.335
or the speeches or the donations
that finally did you that

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:36.255
turned you into an exile,
you know what I mean?

01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:37.381
Nah.

01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:42.719
- You know what it was, don't you?
- What?

01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:44.763
Sex.

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:48.350
Sex.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:50.561
Yes. Sex.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.275
It's odd, you know, but I don't think
I've ever looked at a woman

01:25:56.359 --> 01:26:00.362
without measuring
that possibility between us.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.576
At the same time, I'm not all that interested.

01:26:05.618 --> 01:26:07.161
Never during work.

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:11.290
I suppose it was only
when I wasn't working, that I was

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:14.835
vulnerable.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:19.298
Well, why don't you write
about that vulnerability?

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:22.801
If you want to understand me,

01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:25.888
watch my movies.

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:34.521
All right, sonny boy,

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.773
tell your poor little brother today's problem.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:39.902
Same as yesterday and the day before that
and the day before that.

01:26:39.944 --> 01:26:42.738
And the day before that,
and the day before that.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:45.365
All right. You be creative for a change!

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:49.328
The Tramp buys a flower from the girl.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:53.207
In order for the plot to work,
she has to think he's rich.

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:54.917
That's all.

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:57.252
Except, as you're aware,
the flower girl is blind.

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:03.383
I don't know how to make a blind girl
mistake The Tramp for a millionaire.

01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:05.510
Easy.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.805
We'll do what everyone else is doing.

01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:10.891
Joe!

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:15.479
We'll have the actors talk.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.359
Joseph Curb, Vitaphone.

01:27:20.985 --> 01:27:23.320
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, hello, Joe.

01:27:27.867 --> 01:27:30.994
It's not your fault, son.
You're in the middle of a family feud.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:37.292
Now, you decide who's right.
The Tramp can't talk.

01:27:37.877 --> 01:27:40.170
The minute he talks, he's dead.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.256
Tell me I'm right.

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.217
He can't, because you're wrong.

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:47.511
Who the hell is gonna pay to see you,

01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:49.388
when everybody else
has gone over to sound?

01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:51.348
Who? I'll tell you who.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.767
The Japanese, for one thing,
and the Russkies for another.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:56.478
And anyone else
who doesn't happen to speak English.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.691
Or have you forgotten
about the other nine-tenths of the globe?

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.652
All right, I guess I'll have to show you.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.529
Who's the most famous ballet dancer
in the world?

01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:06.571
Pardon?

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.824
The most famous ballet dancer in the world!

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:10.784
Nijinsky.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:15.789
Fine. So let's say that
he was doing Swan Lake today

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.417
and we all went to see it.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.879
And he came down to the footlights.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.299
And the orchestra stopped.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:28.719
And he said, "Hi folks, I'm Vaslav Nijinsky. "

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:30.637
No, he'd have a Russian accent.

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:34.057
"Hi, folksies. Call me
Vaslav Nijinsky. Sky, sky, sky.

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:37.185
"Oh, just call me Vas.
It doesn't matter. It's okay by me.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.479
"Everything is wonderful in California.

01:28:39.772 --> 01:28:41.690
"Okay, today I'm going to jump
up and down for you

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.233
"like nothing what you've ever seen before.

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:47.821
"Hope you for to like me. Bye. "

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:49.865
You know what would happen
when he danced?

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.742
It would be awful.

01:28:51.784 --> 01:28:53.577
Because the magic is gone.

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:55.662
Just as it would be with The Tramp.

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:00.292
Tell me I'm right.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:07.257
I'm in the word business, Mr. Chaplin,
so I have to say that you're wrong.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.509
But I'm sure as hell glad
I got a chance to meet you.

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:15.891
See you.
- Enjoyed the dancing.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.769
Yeah. And the talking.

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:28.945
Take Mr. Curb back to his office.
Will you, Rollie?

01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.875
Rollie! Get them all back.
Syd, we're in business!

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:45.962
How does a blind girl
mistake The Tramp for a millionaire?

01:29:46.005 --> 01:29:49.257
When she hears the door slam
on a rich man's car.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.510
She thinks The Tramp's the owner.

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:54.596
Easy.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.932
When you know how.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:04.731
Charlie! Sydney! Over here! Throw it to Dad.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.236
Boys!

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:23.166
Boys! I'm taking your ball
down to the cellar.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:27.879
I don't see any stairs.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:44.521
Mum's here. Off you go now!

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.150
Your mummy's here. Ready?

01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:55.782
I'll see you next weekend, okay?
Come on, off you go!

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.785
Off you go! Hey, boys!

01:31:21.392 --> 01:31:23.226
It can't be as bad as all that, Mr. Chaplin.

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:30.066
Do I know you? And why don't I?

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:32.777
I'm Paulette Levy.

01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:35.906
Would you like a drink, Miss Levy?

01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:38.992
I already have one.

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:40.911
How about a fur coat?

01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:43.663
Well...

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:45.373
No, seriously. You look hungry.

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:48.502
Thank you.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:54.966
Actress?

01:31:56.552 --> 01:31:59.179
If you watch the B-movies and don't blink.

01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:03.350
- Don't get any ideas, though.
- You're taken, then.

01:32:03.434 --> 01:32:06.269
No, but I'm 21.

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:08.313
Way too old for you.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:12.484
You're very pretty, Miss Levy.

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:17.239
I'd better be. I didn't get out here
thanks to my Shakespeare reviews.

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:21.034
And may I say something?
You'd be even prettier as a brunette.

01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:24.621
Well, you'd be devastating
if you were six inches taller.

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:29.209
Punch? Two, please.

01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:33.630
Well, at least you can do something
about your hair.

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:36.466
Never! I was born this way.

01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:38.677
Oh, thank you.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:44.099
Hello.
- Nice to see you again, sir.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:33:00.907
Evening, Mr. Chaplin.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:03.410
Sorry, miss. I'm waiting for a natural blonde.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:08.915
Hi.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:11.835
You look beautiful.

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:15.880
- My usual table.
- Of course, Mr. Chaplin, come right this way.

01:33:24.557 --> 01:33:27.309
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Charlie.

01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:32.856
You've come a long way, Charlie.
Yes. My own suit.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:37.235
No need to book a table.
I lived in the lap of luxury. But I was blind.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:38.528
Blind?

01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:41.156
Yes. That's fatal, for a storyteller.

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:44.868
Did I ever tell you that I sold
all my stocks and shares

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:46.661
the year before the Wall Street crash?

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.330
That was clever.

01:33:51.208 --> 01:33:53.752
It was deeply cruel, the Depression.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:59.841
Can I have an autograph, Mr. Chaplin?

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.469
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Sign mine?

01:34:02.553 --> 01:34:03.595
Yes.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:12.312
I wish they'd wanted my money.

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.482
- You know what?
- Hmm?

01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:17.567
I've always had that gift.

01:34:20.529 --> 01:34:25.408
After a man makes love to me,
he just goes wild from happiness.

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:28.411
I am happy.

01:34:30.247 --> 01:34:34.209
Then tell me when you get sad,
because I don't want to be around.

01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:43.051
Terrible things have been
happening out there since the crash.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:46.846
Millions of decent Americans have been
robbed of their right to work.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.599
Machinery is replacing manpower.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:54.979
And I've said nothing.

01:34:59.819 --> 01:35:01.236
Shame on me.

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:05.573
Shame on me.

01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:35.395
You're right, Charlie, you're right.
About three seconds too short.

01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:39.899
Okay, Johnny! We'll do a two-bar repeat
of the xylophone. Yes?

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.276
Sure.

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:43.236
Honey?

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.405
Oh, sorry, darling.

01:35:45.489 --> 01:35:48.825
I'm taking the boys out on the boat today.
Why don't you come on out for some air?

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:50.326
Hmm.

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.996
Tomorrow, darling. Definitely tomorrow.

01:35:54.373 --> 01:35:55.373
All right.

01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.170
Put that in straight away.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:02.756
- What do you want to do?
- Take it out of the minor key.

01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:05.633
Fine. Let me hear it.

01:36:12.516 --> 01:36:14.809
No. I'll tell you why.

01:36:25.988 --> 01:36:30.033
Charlie, you were supposed to meet us
at the fight.

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:33.203
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Who was fighting?

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.622
Mostly Mary and Doug, as it turned out.

01:36:35.706 --> 01:36:38.333
- You're wonderful, Miss Goddard.
- Thanks!

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:50.678
Well, that didn't work either, did it?

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:17.580
Well, the Fairbanks are getting a divorce.

01:37:18.874 --> 01:37:21.251
And Mussolini has invaded Abyssinia.

01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.588
You really need a break, Charlie.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:28.091
We should take a trip.

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:29.217
That's a good idea.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.345
What? What's a good idea?

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.640
Around the world, I thought.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.021
I'm not going to make it.

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:44.816
Charlie!

01:37:51.448 --> 01:37:54.200
Did you lose your other wives this way?

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.996
I think so.

01:37:59.623 --> 01:38:01.749
But you'd have to ask them.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:12.093
Paulette. She was wonderful.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.971
Her personality, you mean?
No.

01:38:15.848 --> 01:38:18.516
You mean in bed?
No. Well, that was good.

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:21.227
No, she's the only one
who didn't take me for a fortune.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.688
Here, let me help you. Come on.

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:29.319
Okay?

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:34.949
I know you so well, Charlie.

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:38.453
I even know what you're thinking.
You're thinking of Doug, aren't you?

01:38:39.955 --> 01:38:42.081
I was the only one who knew.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.924
Don't say Daddy doesn't look after you.

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:52.592
- Paulette!
- Doug?

01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:01.851
Mr. Chaplin. Always a pleasure.

01:39:02.853 --> 01:39:04.854
- How are you? Oh!
- Fine.

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:06.481
How do you look even prettier?

01:39:06.523 --> 01:39:10.985
Nobody's fine and everybody needs a drink.
Paulette, another champagne or a scotch?

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:13.029
Ooh, Scotch, please.

01:39:13.989 --> 01:39:16.407
- Is he...
- Yes.

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:19.077
Seriously?

01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:23.247
- His heart.
- Shit.

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:32.715
Say.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.342
Don't laugh.

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:36.803
I'm going to test for Scarlett.

01:39:36.887 --> 01:39:38.054
Why should I laugh?

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:41.057
Because it's a joke.
Everybody's testing for Scarlett.

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.183
Mmm-hmm.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:45.812
Anyway, I hear Katie Hepburn
has it locked away. So they say.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:49.357
I have not worked since Modern Times.

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.359
No. Neither have I.

01:39:51.735 --> 01:39:54.278
No ideas. I'm desperate.

01:39:55.864 --> 01:39:56.948
Catch you later.

01:40:02.746 --> 01:40:04.497
I can manage a double if I have to.

01:40:04.581 --> 01:40:06.082
Should you?

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:10.086
Say, are you two still married or what?
I find it all very confusing. Hmm!

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.921
Hmm. It's not at all confusing.

01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:14.340
See, when everyone thought
that we were having an affair,

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:15.466
we were married.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.302
Now everyone realizes we're married,
we're getting divorced.

01:40:18.387 --> 01:40:21.764
Man's a wizard with women,
no question about it.

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:26.227
Who's that man? Sounds German.
- Looks German.

01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:29.772
Probably one of those directors,
there's a lot of them over here now.

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.399
Maybe he's got a job for me.

01:40:31.608 --> 01:40:35.611
Just like Plato,
Adolf Hitler is defining the ideal state

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.032
which will become a model
for backward systems.

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:40.742
Do you know him personally?

01:40:42.077 --> 01:40:43.995
I do have that good fortune, yes.

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:47.582
And you have my word.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:50.126
Our ambitions are only to defend

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.295
our historical frontiers to the east.
That's paramount.

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:54.464
Told you. Paramount.

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:56.090
It's not funny, Doug.

01:40:56.341 --> 01:41:00.011
He merely wants to improve the situation
for the German people.

01:41:00.095 --> 01:41:01.554
Create jobs...

01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:05.808
- How can they let these fascist thugs...
- Charlie...

01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:08.519
...to cut out the profit speculator.

01:41:09.646 --> 01:41:10.897
The Jew.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.859
Mr. Chaplin! I am a great admirer of yours.

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:19.822
I'm sorry.
I prefer not to shake hands with Nazis.

01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:24.660
What have you got against us, Mr. Chaplin?

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.830
What have you got against everybody else?

01:41:28.665 --> 01:41:30.875
You must forgive Mr. Chaplin.

01:41:31.794 --> 01:41:33.878
- He's a Jew.
- Ah, so!

01:41:35.672 --> 01:41:37.548
I'm afraid I don't have that honor.

01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:42.136
Shame on you!

01:41:45.015 --> 01:41:47.725
Ah! The former Miss Levy.

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:53.022
Shall we, my dear?

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:04.117
- Good night.
- God bless you, Charlie.

01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:08.579
- Uh, I'll call you.
- Yes. Please do.

01:42:09.706 --> 01:42:11.666
- All right. Good night.
- Night.

01:42:14.711 --> 01:42:17.672
A lovely international incident
you caused in there!

01:42:17.714 --> 01:42:19.674
Hey, let's go on.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.552
Not tonight, old darling. A bit tired.

01:42:24.054 --> 01:42:27.348
It's funny, you know, you look a lot like him.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:30.643
Adolf, I mean.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:37.316
You know, with your mustache on.

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:39.527
I think he stole your act!

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.407
Good night, old boy.

01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:47.076
Night!

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.247
Sweet prince.

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:58.796
So much ended around then.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:01.257
I'd been there 25 years.

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:05.136
Everybody else had gone over to sound.

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:08.681
I didn't know how much longer
I could hold out against it.

01:43:09.266 --> 01:43:10.391
Mario.

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:13.477
Of course, UA was over for me.

01:43:13.937 --> 01:43:15.646
United Artists?

01:43:17.774 --> 01:43:21.611
You know, you haven't written anything
about that. How it began, I mean.

01:43:21.653 --> 01:43:25.698
Oh, I'll put something in.
It was a great idea, I think.

01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:29.160
Creative people really had their say
for the first time.

01:43:29.244 --> 01:43:31.370
- You like milk?
- No milk.

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:38.461
I remember some distributor saying,
"The lunatics have taken over the asylum. "

01:43:38.587 --> 01:43:42.089
- That became quite a famous remark.
- Yeah.

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.760
Thank you.

01:43:48.847 --> 01:43:51.766
But UA did mean a lot to Doug.

01:43:54.102 --> 01:43:57.021
When my mother died, it was sad. Yes, but...

01:43:58.649 --> 01:44:01.150
She was old, she'd had her run.

01:44:01.985 --> 01:44:04.070
It was different with Doug.

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.281
Even today, I still miss him.

01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:14.330
Oh, yes, tell me, when did you actually
start work on The Great Dictator?

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:16.332
- '38.
- '38?

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:19.210
And everyone thought you were crazy then.

01:44:20.003 --> 01:44:23.214
When the Second World War broke out,
you became a genius overnight.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.593
Well, not to those who thought
I was a communist.

01:44:56.915 --> 01:44:58.249
Big smile!

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:06.716
I know you. You bastard.

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:11.554
Syd? Is that you?

01:45:14.224 --> 01:45:15.308
Hmm.

01:45:16.727 --> 01:45:18.352
What's the matter, Syd?

01:45:18.395 --> 01:45:21.480
For 10 years, you've been on at me
to make me a talkie. Now I'm making a talkie.

01:45:21.857 --> 01:45:24.358
Yeah, but not this.

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:30.197
I know this man.

01:45:31.199 --> 01:45:34.285
We're born the same year, four days apart.

01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:37.621
He's like me, capable of anything.

01:45:38.915 --> 01:45:44.420
Nobody wants to see a film
about Adolf fucking Hitler!

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.422
I do!

01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:52.720
You're missing the point.

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:56.974
In the end, it's not about Hitler,
it's about The Tramp.

01:45:57.059 --> 01:46:00.853
- The little Jewish barber taking his place.
- Charlie,

01:46:00.937 --> 01:46:03.939
what's happening in Europe
is not our problem.

01:46:04.232 --> 01:46:07.610
90% of Americans say
we should stay out of the war.

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.862
That's nine out of 10!

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:12.156
It's not your business.

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:13.741
You're a comic.

01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:18.704
Yes, Syd. And you are a Jew.

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:28.839
Nevertheless,

01:46:28.924 --> 01:46:30.800
I've got to give it a try.

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:34.512
Otherwise, what have I been doing

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.806
all these years?

01:46:37.766 --> 01:46:41.185
I know talking will be the end of The Tramp.
That's for sure.

01:46:43.313 --> 01:46:46.857
But at least he'll go out
saying something I believe in.

01:46:49.528 --> 01:46:52.822
All right. We'll see how it goes.

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.115
Roll camera!

01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:59.120
The Great Dictator, scene Y-11-A, take one.

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:07.670
I'm sorry, but I'm not an emperor.

01:47:08.505 --> 01:47:11.048
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:13.759
I should like to help everyone, if possible.

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:16.512
Jew, Gentile, black man, white.

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:20.850
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:23.853
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

01:47:24.521 --> 01:47:26.856
Greed has poisoned men's souls,

01:47:27.357 --> 01:47:29.650
has barricaded the world with hate,

01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:32.528
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:34.363
Do not despair.

01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:38.284
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.

01:47:38.368 --> 01:47:40.786
He's not talking about Germany, you know?

01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:45.207
He is talking about America. That is...
Turn that goddamn thing down!

01:47:46.209 --> 01:47:48.461
Soldiers, don't
give yourselves to brutes.

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:52.381
That is what we need
to make people understand.

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:54.717
...tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel.

01:47:54.759 --> 01:47:58.637
To drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:02.016
Mr. Seeley, you're looking a little pale.

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.561
Maybe it's time you took a trip to California.

01:48:06.396 --> 01:48:09.690
Comrades! Let us all fight for a new world.

01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:11.275
Commie bastard!

01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:17.740
Soldiers! In the name of democracy,
let us unite!

01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:24.246
- So what brings you to California?
- Oh, I was sent by my firm.

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.583
We're planning on expanding our interest
in the movie business.

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:31.170
Although I really don't know
that much about it.

01:48:31.254 --> 01:48:33.255
Quite a full house today, sir.

01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:36.509
Congratulations, Charlie,
on the London opening.

01:48:36.593 --> 01:48:37.927
Oh, thank you.

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:42.723
- Tea is on its way, sir.
- Good.

01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:44.767
Lovely afternoon, Charlie, thank you.

01:48:44.809 --> 01:48:46.894
Sorry, Charlie.

01:48:53.318 --> 01:48:57.363
Women drop handkerchiefs.
I guess men drop other things.

01:49:05.455 --> 01:49:07.122
- Charlie?
- Yes.

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:11.961
Charlie, upper regional domes
immensely expansive.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.504
What?

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:17.675
Upper regional domes,
immensely expansive.

01:49:17.759 --> 01:49:20.261
That's how you describe Joan Barry
in your book.

01:49:21.346 --> 01:49:24.223
She was very... She was
well-endowed, is that what you mean?

01:49:25.016 --> 01:49:26.016
Yes.

01:49:26.142 --> 01:49:29.144
You honestly expect your readers
to believe that it wasn't just sex?

01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:32.898
Well, I didn't have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her.

01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:36.277
I didn't exactly throw money around.
I spent thousands on her.

01:49:36.319 --> 01:49:38.445
I wrote a screenplay for her.

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:42.825
I don't care what the readers think.
Joan definitely had talent.

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.953
She was intelligent. She was pretty.

01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:48.330
She was willing to work hard.

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:52.001
And the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic.

01:49:54.129 --> 01:49:56.130
But she became erratic.

01:49:57.048 --> 01:50:01.135
For whatever reason,
she began to have some kind of breakdown.

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:06.515
She took to driving up to my house,
drunk, in the middle of the night.

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:11.186
She was arrested, ran up debts,
made scenes.

01:50:12.564 --> 01:50:16.692
In the end, as I've explained, I refused
to have anything further to do with her.

01:50:17.819 --> 01:50:20.321
How could you have been
such a fool, Charlie?

01:50:20.822 --> 01:50:23.699
You took up with a crazy girl
with umpteen different identities,

01:50:23.742 --> 01:50:25.951
was a promiscuous, vengeful liar.

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:30.539
And for, perhaps, the only time in your life,
you didn't propose marriage.

01:50:31.499 --> 01:50:34.335
Hoover had kept tabs on you for 20 years.

01:50:34.753 --> 01:50:37.379
And he still had no idea how to nail you
until you played

01:50:37.881 --> 01:50:41.175
right into his hands by shutting Joan out.

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:47.097
You're improving, Frank.

01:50:47.182 --> 01:50:50.142
Can't you find someone else
to play with?

01:50:50.226 --> 01:50:53.062
Apparently not. Not anymore.

01:50:55.231 --> 01:50:57.524
- Who's that?
- Ah, the debutante.

01:50:58.693 --> 01:51:00.694
You're doing a favor for her agent.

01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:04.448
Oh, not another one that wants to act.
It's endless. Endless!

01:51:05.367 --> 01:51:07.284
This is the last time.

01:51:07.702 --> 01:51:09.578
They all think it's so easy, you know.

01:51:09.621 --> 01:51:11.830
I bet when she was 10,
she wanted to be a fireman.

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.707
Tell you what, you have half an hour,
then get me out of it.

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.084
- Some appointment.
- Right.

01:51:15.126 --> 01:51:17.419
- Someone important.
- Leave it to me.

01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:19.296
Mr. Chaplin?

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:22.966
I'm Oona O'Neill.

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.096
Hi.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.597
My agent did say 3:00.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.432
But if I'm interrupting your game,
I can always come back...

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:32.101
No! No.

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.562
I was waiting for you.

01:51:40.902 --> 01:51:42.820
I always have tea at 4:00.

01:51:43.446 --> 01:51:46.115
- So how long have you been in Hollywood?
- Just this summer.

01:51:48.076 --> 01:51:50.661
My agent got me a screen test at Fox.

01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:54.164
They gonna put you under contract?

01:51:55.792 --> 01:51:56.875
I don't know.

01:51:59.295 --> 01:52:00.295
You tell me.

01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:04.258
Yes, if you want me to.

01:52:05.593 --> 01:52:06.593
Uh, Charlie!

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:10.514
Charlie, excuse me.
It's nearly time for your appointment.

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.474
Appointment?

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:17.479
Appointment.

01:52:19.816 --> 01:52:20.941
Who's it with, Frank?

01:52:22.152 --> 01:52:23.527
Uh, Fred.

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:28.323
Fred. Not Astaire again.

01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:31.368
- That's right.
- Ginger, too?

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.078
Could be.

01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:36.290
Well, I'm sick of them.

01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:38.167
Tell them I've got nothing more
to teach them.

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.085
They're gonna have to try
and make it on their own.

01:52:42.213 --> 01:52:43.380
Right.

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:50.345
I'm sorry.
I asked him to interrupt in case I was...

01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:55.225
I mean, in case you were...

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:03.400
I've never been to England.

01:53:34.724 --> 01:53:36.391
You're a good dancer.

01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:08.799
George, lâ€™ve just
written this for the end.

01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:13.387
For the last 20 years
I have known what happiness means.

01:54:14.055 --> 01:54:17.808
I wish I could write more about this.
But it involves love.

01:54:18.434 --> 01:54:22.104
And perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations.

01:54:22.146 --> 01:54:24.481
Because it is more than one can express.

01:54:24.566 --> 01:54:25.941
Excuse me.

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.444
- ... Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Henry.

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:35.117
- I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.
- No, it's all right. Come in. Come in.

01:54:39.455 --> 01:54:40.789
What is it, Henry?

01:54:40.832 --> 01:54:42.708
Well, I'm not quite sure, sir.

01:54:42.792 --> 01:54:45.252
I just took a call from Miss Barry, sir.

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:49.089
She wanted me to tell you, sir,
that she's pregnant, sir.

01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:00.601
I never... Um... Before I started...

01:55:04.314 --> 01:55:05.731
Where's Mr. Charles?

01:55:05.815 --> 01:55:07.316
With Harry.

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:11.653
Oh, he may be on the stage by now.

01:55:13.031 --> 01:55:15.324
Mr. Charles, he down there?

01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:22.497
Charlie. Okay.

01:55:23.291 --> 01:55:27.920
She'll drop the paternity suit.
I just talked to her lawyers, she'll settle.

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.047
- No.
- What?

01:55:31.007 --> 01:55:32.507
Well, just listen.

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:36.428
She'll take $150,000.
And that's nothing, not compared to a trial.

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:40.515
She says you did it at Christmas
when she came to your house.

01:55:40.558 --> 01:55:42.476
- Morning, Mary.
- Good morning.

01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:45.187
Kid, I've been making deals for you
all our lives.

01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:46.355
I've never made one this good.

01:55:46.397 --> 01:55:49.858
It was over long before Christmas.
It can't be my child.

01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:51.360
Just get it out of the way.

01:55:51.402 --> 01:55:53.028
I can't do that.

01:55:53.071 --> 01:55:56.448
I've got Oona to think of now.
Syd, I've got to prove my innocence.

01:55:56.532 --> 01:56:00.202
Look, I'm all for proving your innocence, kid.
But how?

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:05.540
Go back to them.

01:56:07.877 --> 01:56:09.211
I beg you.

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:12.381
Get them to agree to a blood test.

01:56:12.882 --> 01:56:15.801
So that night
when you went to his house,

01:56:15.885 --> 01:56:20.555
did you and Mr. Chaplin
have sexual relations?

01:56:21.683 --> 01:56:23.058
Doesn't it look like it?

01:56:24.227 --> 01:56:25.394
Never mind what it looks like.

01:56:25.436 --> 01:56:27.771
Did you have sexual relations
with Mr. Chaplin?

01:56:27.855 --> 01:56:31.024
She just said she did. Why else
would she agree to the blood tests?

01:56:33.987 --> 01:56:36.655
The next morning he just called a cab.

01:56:37.699 --> 01:56:39.241
Paid me off.

01:56:42.412 --> 01:56:45.080
He wanted somebody younger, classier.

01:56:47.917 --> 01:56:49.292
Didn't he?

01:57:03.266 --> 01:57:04.558
Hello.

01:57:06.769 --> 01:57:07.811
Yes.

01:57:09.439 --> 01:57:10.605
Yes.

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.278
Yes, thank you.

01:57:18.156 --> 01:57:19.740
It's all over.

01:57:20.616 --> 01:57:23.035
The blood test prove it's not my baby.

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:36.590
Right, let's just forget all this new-fangled
rubbish about blood tests.

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:38.633
Let's put it out of our minds.

01:57:38.676 --> 01:57:41.678
His Honor has ruled them inadmissible.

01:57:41.763 --> 01:57:45.807
What is important now
is the financial future of this poor child.

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:49.311
It is her future the state of California
is here to protect.

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.022
It makes me mad

01:57:52.607 --> 01:57:56.568
to watch the way this fellow
tries to put it over us simpletons.

01:57:56.652 --> 01:58:00.238
This great star of stage and screen,
this alien,

01:58:00.323 --> 01:58:03.450
who has enjoyed the hospitality
of our country for nearly 30 years

01:58:03.493 --> 01:58:05.494
without ever once, ever once,

01:58:06.037 --> 01:58:08.789
deigning to apply for American citizenship.

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:13.585
But what good
has all this money done Chaplin?

01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:16.421
Wasting his substance in debauching girls.

01:58:16.506 --> 01:58:18.632
What good has it done the country?

01:58:18.674 --> 01:58:22.010
This is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism.

01:58:23.638 --> 01:58:26.807
Now my client, on the other hand,

01:58:28.893 --> 01:58:30.310
is, alas,

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:34.523
no more moral than Chaplin.

01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:39.277
Yes. Yes. They're both equally guilty.

01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:43.448
Only, Chaplin is old enough to be her father.

01:58:44.033 --> 01:58:46.326
Prowling around with girls that age.

01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:51.706
Members of the jury, use your God-given
common sense, and just look at this man.

01:58:53.501 --> 01:58:57.129
This cheap, Cockney cad.

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.507
This

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.386
little tramp.

01:59:06.347 --> 01:59:08.557
And then take a very good look

01:59:09.767 --> 01:59:11.977
at innocent little Carol Ann.

01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:16.898
I defy you not to see the resemblance.

01:59:17.525 --> 01:59:19.609
Gentlemen and ladies,

01:59:20.903 --> 01:59:24.072
wives and mothers around the country
are watching you.

01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:27.701
Watching to see you stop Chaplin
in his tracks.

01:59:28.244 --> 01:59:32.622
You'll sleep well
the night you give this baby a name.

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.084
The night you show this lecher

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:40.213
that the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row.

02:00:07.658 --> 02:00:09.701
It's a star-studded evening here.

02:00:12.955 --> 02:00:17.125
Here is Charlie Chaplin
with his lovely wife, Oona.

02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:25.800
There goes Mrs. Chaplin,
looking gorgeous this evening

02:00:25.843 --> 02:00:27.636
on the arm of her famous husband...

02:00:46.822 --> 02:00:48.990
Are you a communist, Mr. Chaplin?

02:00:49.033 --> 02:00:52.160
- Are you a fellow traveler?
- Mr. Chaplin...

02:00:52.245 --> 02:00:55.163
Are you going to attend
the McCarthy hearing?

02:00:55.456 --> 02:00:58.250
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.
- Mr. Chaplin...

02:00:58.334 --> 02:01:02.379
Mr. Chaplin has repeatedly said
he'll go whenever they call him.

02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:09.803
And even... Even if there were only
one communist in the state department,

02:01:10.346 --> 02:01:13.014
even if there were only one communist
in the state department,

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:16.017
that would still be one communist too many.

02:01:18.562 --> 02:01:21.648
Mr. Lawson, are you
a member of the Communist Party

02:01:21.691 --> 02:01:24.192
or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

02:01:24.277 --> 02:01:27.696
It's unfortunate and tragic
that I have to teach this committee

02:01:27.738 --> 02:01:29.781
- the basic principles of Americanism.
- That's not the question.

02:01:29.865 --> 02:01:31.825
That's not the question.

02:01:31.867 --> 02:01:35.120
The question is, have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

02:01:35.204 --> 02:01:39.291
I'm framing my answer in
the only way in which any American citizen

02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:43.878
can frame his answer to a question
which absolutely invades his...

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:46.339
Then you refuse to answer
that question, is that correct?

02:01:46.382 --> 02:01:48.925
I have told you
that I will offer my beliefs...

02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:51.553
- I have written Americanism...
- Stand away from the stand!

02:01:51.595 --> 02:01:53.930
- ... for many years and I shall continue...
- Stand away from the stand!

02:01:54.015 --> 02:01:56.558
...to fight for the Bill of Rights
which you are seeking to destroy.

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.101
Officer, take this man
away from the stand.

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.195
I'd love to get away for a while, darling.

02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:14.409
Maybe after this bundle arrives
we could take the children and go.

02:02:26.714 --> 02:02:27.922
Sir.

02:02:29.258 --> 02:02:30.425
Sir.

02:02:31.093 --> 02:02:34.721
We've just got word.
Chaplin's off to London on vacation.

02:03:01.332 --> 02:03:03.124
KK.
- Mummy, Mummy.

02:03:03.167 --> 02:03:04.709
Where did you leave Mr. Chaplin?

02:03:04.794 --> 02:03:07.462
- We left him back there at the stern.
- Mummy.

02:03:07.505 --> 02:03:09.506
It's all right, darling.

02:03:11.467 --> 02:03:12.467
Charlie.

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:24.813
Charlie.

02:03:25.606 --> 02:03:28.733
What? What is it, sweetheart?

02:03:31.153 --> 02:03:32.278
Is it Syd?

02:03:33.155 --> 02:03:34.322
No.

02:03:35.157 --> 02:03:36.658
What is it?

02:03:41.205 --> 02:03:42.705
They've thrown you out.

02:03:45.459 --> 02:03:48.002
Thrown me out? Thrown me out of what?

02:03:51.882 --> 02:03:53.383
Of America.

02:03:57.388 --> 02:03:59.013
I'm so sorry.

02:04:05.813 --> 02:04:07.689
- I can't go back?
- No.

02:04:13.863 --> 02:04:15.155
Charlie.

02:04:18.242 --> 02:04:21.995
There are nights
it's still hard being in exile.

02:04:22.872 --> 02:04:24.706
I'm sure they wouldn't
refuse you a visa now, Charles.

02:04:26.167 --> 02:04:27.584
Have you never thought of going back?

02:04:27.668 --> 02:04:30.795
- Why don't we all go inside?
I have everything I need right here.

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.089
- But it's cold.
I like the cold.

02:04:33.174 --> 02:04:35.425
- I have to go anyway.
Telephone.

02:04:35.509 --> 02:04:38.678
Charlie, I heard the first three rings,
thank you.

02:04:39.388 --> 02:04:43.600
No, George, in answer to your question.
I'm used to invitations.

02:04:44.226 --> 02:04:45.518
Ah, yes.

02:04:45.561 --> 02:04:46.936
Well, it's been a long day, Charlie.

02:04:47.396 --> 02:04:49.564
Yes. You must be very tired.

02:04:51.233 --> 02:04:53.276
Come on, George, finish it off.

02:04:54.445 --> 02:04:56.237
The question mark.

02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.114
What's it all about?

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:00.950
You mean that?

02:05:02.578 --> 02:05:03.620
Yes.

02:05:05.122 --> 02:05:08.500
Well, it was a personal matter, really.
Nothing relevant.

02:05:08.751 --> 02:05:09.751
Tell me.

02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:12.879
All right.

02:05:14.924 --> 02:05:15.924
The madness.

02:05:17.134 --> 02:05:20.094
I just wondered, how much did it affect you?

02:05:22.431 --> 02:05:24.140
What makes you think it did?

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:27.685
- Well, your mother was certified insane...
- Yes.

02:05:28.312 --> 02:05:30.688
...and your grandmother
was certified insane as well, and...

02:05:30.773 --> 02:05:32.023
Yes.

02:05:34.443 --> 02:05:37.695
That's not what dogged me, George.
It wasn't that.

02:05:43.494 --> 02:05:44.786
It was...

02:05:45.329 --> 02:05:50.291
It was the knowledge that if you did
what I did for a living, if you were a clown,

02:05:50.834 --> 02:05:54.587
and you had a passion
to tell a particular kind of story,

02:05:58.300 --> 02:05:59.634
something

02:06:02.429 --> 02:06:03.680
beyond,

02:06:04.974 --> 02:06:07.433
but you only have the one chance
to get it right.

02:06:07.476 --> 02:06:09.227
And I never did.

02:06:09.311 --> 02:06:11.729
One never does. But you know that.

02:06:12.856 --> 02:06:15.358
That's not the problem.

02:06:22.366 --> 02:06:25.493
It's when you feel you're getting really close

02:06:26.829 --> 02:06:28.663
but you can't make it the rest of the way.

02:06:29.206 --> 02:06:32.500
You're not good enough.
You're not complete enough.

02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:35.920
And despite all your fantasies,

02:06:37.506 --> 02:06:38.715
you're second-rate.

02:06:39.008 --> 02:06:40.008
Charlie.

02:06:40.217 --> 02:06:41.634
Human.

02:06:45.014 --> 02:06:46.848
That's very hard.

02:06:52.021 --> 02:06:53.396
Why didn't you add that?

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.565
It's not important, really.

02:06:56.734 --> 02:06:59.277
End of the day,
you're not judged by what you didn't do,

02:06:59.361 --> 02:07:01.112
but by what you did.

02:07:02.698 --> 02:07:05.283
And I didn't change things, I just...

02:07:07.202 --> 02:07:08.536
He just

02:07:11.081 --> 02:07:12.874
cheered people up.

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.461
Not bad, that.

02:07:59.254 --> 02:08:00.588
Charlie?

02:08:03.133 --> 02:08:04.425
Charlie?

02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:11.557
Charlie, dear.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:15.269
I dreamed I was answering questions
for George. Silly.

02:08:15.938 --> 02:08:20.358
Charlie, that was California calling again.
You really do have to give them an answer.

02:08:20.442 --> 02:08:23.653
No. They took 20 years
to make up their mind,

02:08:23.737 --> 02:08:26.823
- I can take another afternoon.
- Enough. Enough!

02:08:32.287 --> 02:08:34.414
What if they still hate me?

02:08:43.132 --> 02:08:49.470
Live from Los Angeles, the 44th
annual Academy Awards presentation.

02:09:03.485 --> 02:09:05.987
Suppose they start throwing things.

02:09:06.447 --> 02:09:08.156
Now that would be a story.

02:09:08.198 --> 02:09:10.992
You never know on the stage.

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:15.538
Hmm, I can see the headlines now.
"Amazing Incident At Academy Awards.

02:09:15.622 --> 02:09:17.915
"Chaplin Disappears
Under Avalanche Of Oscars. "

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.709
Mr. Walter Matthau.

02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:22.128
Oh, look, darling, it's Walter.

02:09:24.006 --> 02:09:25.923
Does that make you happy?

02:09:26.008 --> 02:09:28.009
- No.
- Crabby.

02:09:28.844 --> 02:09:32.889
Oh, I should never have let them
show those film clips. I never...

02:09:32.973 --> 02:09:35.975
People won't like them.
They'll think they're old.

02:09:36.018 --> 02:09:38.478
Well, they are old.
Well over 50 years, some of them.

02:09:42.357 --> 02:09:45.693
You know the worst thing about age,

02:09:47.029 --> 02:09:49.030
you can't defend yourself.

02:09:50.908 --> 02:09:55.369
When I was young, handsome,
had my power,

02:09:56.455 --> 02:10:01.626
if they came after me, I'd make a movie
and make them laugh and I'd make them cry.

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:06.088
Now I'm at their mercy.

02:10:07.716 --> 02:10:09.467
- Come in.
- Go away.

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:12.762
We're ready for you, Mr. Chaplin.

02:10:12.846 --> 02:10:16.015
This is a historic milestone
in the life of the Academy.

02:10:16.058 --> 02:10:17.809
Behave yourself.

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:21.896
I would like to present the President
of the Academy, Mr. Daniel Taradash.

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:25.817
Now remember, the President
of the Academy, Mr. Daniel Taradash.

02:10:25.901 --> 02:10:27.527
- Taradash?
- Yes.

02:10:27.569 --> 02:10:29.362
Sounds like a spice.

02:10:29.571 --> 02:10:32.448
The inscription reads,
"To Charles Chaplin,

02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:36.911
"for the incalculable effect
he has had in making motion pictures

02:10:36.954 --> 02:10:39.247
"the art form of this century.

02:10:41.959 --> 02:10:46.921
"Humor heightens our sense of survival
and preserves our sanity. "

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:50.174
These are the words of Charlie Chaplin.

02:10:50.551 --> 02:10:54.262
The abiding elements
of Chaplin's artistic conscience

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:57.098
as actor, writer, director,

02:10:57.599 --> 02:11:01.435
and to quote W.C. Fields,
"The greatest ballet dancer that ever lived. "

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:04.105
A few years ago, Mr. Chaplin said,

02:11:04.648 --> 02:11:07.358
"My only enemy is time. "

02:11:08.318 --> 02:11:10.236
We respectfully disagree.

02:11:10.279 --> 02:11:12.613
I'm going to leave you here, darling.

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:14.699
My white dress, remember?

02:11:15.450 --> 02:11:17.535
They mustn't see anyone
till the clips are over.

02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:22.456
...some unfathomable future
on some faraway star.

02:11:22.624 --> 02:11:27.628
Time is Charlie Chaplin's dearest
and eternal friend.

02:11:28.755 --> 02:11:30.715
And here is the proof.

02:11:30.799 --> 02:11:34.302
Watch, remember, rejoice.

02:12:40.953 --> 02:12:42.828
I love you, Charlie.
