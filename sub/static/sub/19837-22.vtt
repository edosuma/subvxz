00:01.830 --> 00:03.980
<b>This country allows ordinary tourists.</b>

00:04.430 --> 00:06.170
<b>That's where we'll find Killua?</b>

00:06.170 --> 00:09.030
<b>By airship, it will take three days to reach...</b>

00:09.030 --> 00:10.500
<b>When do we leave?</b>

00:10.500 --> 00:11.770
<b>Today! Right now!</b>

00:11.770 --> 00:13.320
<b>Yeah, no objection from me!</b>

00:13.950 --> 00:16.780
<b>Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.</b>

01:49.550 --> 01:52.170
<b><i>I'm from a family of assassins.</i></b>

01:52.540 --> 01:54.110
<b><i>So they're all assassins.</i></b>

01:55.030 --> 01:57.460
<b><i>And the family has</i></b>

01:57.460 --> 01:59.570
<b><i>really high hopes for me...</i></b>

02:00.110 --> 02:02.840
<b><i>But I can't stand it.</i></b>

02:03.490 --> 02:05.890
<b><i>Who wants to have their life 
planned out for them?</i></b>

02:10.410 --> 02:11.590
<b>Killua...</b>

02:14.590 --> 02:16.880
<b>What's with the long face, Gon?</b>

02:16.880 --> 02:19.030
<b>We'll be in the Republic of 
Padokea by morning.</b>

02:19.720 --> 02:21.320
<b>You'll see Killua soon enough.</b>

02:22.110 --> 02:23.030
<b>Yep!</b>

02:27.550 --> 02:30.040
<b><i>We'll definitely take Killua back with us!</i></b>

02:30.040 --> 02:35.050
<b>A x Dangerous x Watchdog</b>

02:39.480 --> 02:42.810
<b>Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived</b>

02:42.810 --> 02:45.220
<b>in the Dentora region</b>

02:45.220 --> 02:47.730
<b>of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives.</b>

02:55.130 --> 02:56.730
<b>There it is.</b>

02:57.100 --> 02:59.990
<b>The base for this family of 
assassins is on that mountain?</b>

03:00.530 --> 03:02.990
<b>It sure looks creepy...</b>

03:02.990 --> 03:04.120
<b>Yes.</b>

03:04.560 --> 03:05.740
<b>Once we reach our destination,</b>

03:05.740 --> 03:07.390
<b>we should start gathering information.</b>

03:07.390 --> 03:08.120
<b>Okay.</b>

03:10.590 --> 03:12.130
<b>Kukuroo Mountain?</b>

03:12.130 --> 03:15.130
<b>In that case, you should take the 
scenic mountain bus tour over there.</b>

03:15.540 --> 03:18.170
<b>The tour only runs once a day, 
but you'll have a guide</b>

03:18.170 --> 03:20.130
<b>to show you around.</b>

03:22.070 --> 03:23.740
<b>Okay...</b>

03:23.740 --> 03:28.200
<b>Thank you for taking the 
Lamentation Tour today.</b>

03:28.800 --> 03:31.810
<b>We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain,</b>

03:31.810 --> 03:36.440
<b>home to the famous Zoldyck 
family of assassins.</b>

03:37.370 --> 03:38.280
<b>Look.</b>

03:42.920 --> 03:44.950
<b>They obviously aren't tourists.</b>

03:45.800 --> 03:47.000
<b>Yes...</b>

03:47.000 --> 03:48.950
<b>Everyone?</b>

03:49.250 --> 03:51.830
<b>Please look to your right.</b>

03:52.370 --> 03:56.340
<b>That is Kukuroo Mountain, 
where the Zoldyck family lives.</b>

03:57.240 --> 04:01.570
<b>A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain,</b>

04:01.570 --> 04:06.170
<b>and the Zoldyck estate is 
somewhere on that mountain.</b>

04:06.170 --> 04:08.430
<b>But no one has ever actually seen it.</b>

04:09.420 --> 04:12.280
<b>The Zoldyck family includes ten members:</b>

04:12.280 --> 04:16.150
<b>a great-grandfather, grandfather, 
grandmother, father, mother,</b>

04:16.150 --> 04:18.480
<b>and then, there are five children.</b>

04:18.480 --> 04:20.250
<b>All of them are assassins!</b>

04:21.760 --> 04:25.980
<b>Then, let us approach the mountain.</b>

04:32.250 --> 04:34.000
<b>That's really something.</b>

04:34.370 --> 04:37.500
<b>This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.</b>

04:38.240 --> 04:40.950
<b>Also known as the Door to Hades</b>

04:40.950 --> 04:45.460
<b>because no one who's entered 
has ever returned alive.</b>

04:45.460 --> 04:47.930
<b>To enter, you must pass through the door</b>

04:47.930 --> 04:49.760
<b>beside the security checkpoint.</b>

04:49.760 --> 04:52.530
<b>But the area beyond the gate 
is private property,</b>

04:52.530 --> 04:54.010
<b>so we can't proceed.</b>

04:54.010 --> 04:54.880
<b>Hold on!</b>

04:54.880 --> 04:56.270
<b>This is the front gate?</b>

04:56.270 --> 04:58.580
<b>The mountain's all the way over there!</b>

04:58.580 --> 04:59.730
<b>Correct...</b>

04:59.730 --> 05:03.650
<b>The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain,</b>

05:04.000 --> 05:06.500
<b>as well as the surrounding land.</b>

05:07.270 --> 05:10.520
<b>This whole area is their backyard?</b>

05:10.520 --> 05:11.970
<b>Hey, guide...</b>

05:11.970 --> 05:12.660
<b>Yes?</b>

05:13.110 --> 05:15.660
<b>What do we have to do to get inside?</b>

05:16.990 --> 05:19.920
<b>Little boy, were you listening 
to my explanation?</b>

05:20.220 --> 05:21.070
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

05:21.070 --> 05:22.160
<b>But...</b>

05:22.160 --> 05:24.960
<b>If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!</b>

05:25.450 --> 05:27.300
<b>Assassins live inside.</b>

05:27.870 --> 05:29.280
<b>It's all a sham.</b>

05:29.280 --> 05:29.930
<b>Huh?</b>

05:30.340 --> 05:33.210
<b>A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.</b>

05:33.210 --> 05:38.310
<b>Just a photo of their faces is 
worth a hundred million.</b>

05:38.780 --> 05:39.980
<b>Seriously?!</b>

05:39.980 --> 05:40.660
<b>Damn!</b>

05:40.660 --> 05:43.020
<b>I should have taken a picture of Killua!</b>

05:44.740 --> 05:47.940
<b>It's just another case of rampant rumors</b>

05:47.940 --> 05:50.570
<b>masking a mundane truth.</b>

05:57.710 --> 05:58.700
<b>Open the gate!</b>

05:58.700 --> 06:00.280
<b>I-I cannot do that.</b>

06:00.280 --> 06:03.090
<b>The master would not be pleased.</b>

06:03.470 --> 06:05.250
<b>Don't worry.</b>

06:05.250 --> 06:08.830
<b>We're going to kill your master.</b>

06:16.970 --> 06:18.450
<b>Ouch...</b>

06:18.450 --> 06:19.830
<b>Are you okay?</b>

06:20.410 --> 06:22.710
<b>Yes, I'm fine.</b>

06:25.430 --> 06:30.110
<b>Man... Now Mike's going to end up 
eating between meals again.</b>

06:30.480 --> 06:31.440
<b>Huh?</b>

07:00.560 --> 07:01.480
<b>Please...</b>

07:02.130 --> 07:05.480
<b>He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.</b>

07:06.210 --> 07:07.590
<b>Mike!</b>

07:07.590 --> 07:09.860
<b>Don't blame me if you get fat!</b>

07:10.270 --> 07:12.140
<b>What was that?</b>

07:19.880 --> 07:21.370
<b>Hey, boys!</b>

07:22.010 --> 07:22.880
<b>What are you doing?</b>

07:23.380 --> 07:24.880
<b>Get on the bus!</b>

07:26.110 --> 07:27.610
<b>You can leave.</b>

07:27.610 --> 07:29.630
<b>We're staying here.</b>

07:30.250 --> 07:31.010
<b>Huh?</b>

07:41.680 --> 07:43.460
<b>I see.</b>

07:43.460 --> 07:46.150
<b>So you're young Killua's friends.</b>

07:46.610 --> 07:48.150
<b>I'm happy to hear that.</b>

07:48.150 --> 07:50.540
<b>I've worked here for twenty years,</b>

07:50.540 --> 07:53.370
<b>but this is the first time</b>

07:53.370 --> 07:56.770
<b>any friends have come to visit.</b>

07:59.430 --> 08:03.000
<b>Since I work here, I shouldn't say this,</b>

08:03.580 --> 08:05.570
<b>but the place is rather lonely.</b>

08:05.570 --> 08:08.000
<b>No one ever visits.</b>

08:08.660 --> 08:12.560
<b>Though we do see a lot of those...</b>

08:13.400 --> 08:17.080
<b>Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual.</b>

08:17.080 --> 08:19.590
<b>So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.</b>

08:19.590 --> 08:22.670
<b>Anyway, I'm glad you're here.</b>

08:22.670 --> 08:24.040
<b>Thank you.</b>

08:24.040 --> 08:25.020
<b>Don't mention it.</b>

08:25.450 --> 08:27.450
<b>However...</b>

08:27.450 --> 08:31.150
<b>I cannot let you inside.</b>

08:33.300 --> 08:37.550
<b>Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?</b>

08:38.350 --> 08:40.260
<b>Its name is Mike.</b>

08:40.260 --> 08:43.020
<b>It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.</b>

08:43.020 --> 08:46.170
<b>It only obeys family, 
and will attack anyone else.</b>

08:46.680 --> 08:49.460
<b>The beast still follows the order</b>

08:49.460 --> 08:52.520
<b>its master gave it ten years ago...</b>

08:53.550 --> 08:58.180
<b>To kill every single intruder.</b>

08:58.810 --> 09:01.120
<b>But technically, he isn't following the order.</b>

09:01.120 --> 09:02.790
<b>Because he keeps eating them...</b>

09:05.190 --> 09:07.990
<b>Anyway, I can't let you inside.</b>

09:07.990 --> 09:12.690
<b>I wouldn't want to reduce young 
Killua's friends to skeletons.</b>

09:14.850 --> 09:18.200
<b>Sir, how is it that you're safe?</b>

09:19.640 --> 09:21.790
<b>You go inside, correct?</b>

09:22.330 --> 09:26.960
<b>If you never needed to enter, 
you wouldn't have a key.</b>

09:28.180 --> 09:29.960
<b>Quite perceptive of you.</b>

09:30.400 --> 09:33.460
<b>But you're only half right.</b>

09:33.930 --> 09:37.180
<b>I require no key to get inside.</b>

09:37.180 --> 09:40.720
<b>This key is for intruders.</b>

09:41.180 --> 09:42.720
<b>A key for intruders?</b>

09:43.360 --> 09:46.130
<b>For some reason,</b>

09:46.130 --> 09:50.200
<b>eighty to ninety percent of intruders 
attempt to use the front gate.</b>

09:51.380 --> 09:53.870
<b>If I don't open the gate for them,</b>

09:53.870 --> 09:57.520
<b>they'll try to break it down.</b>

09:57.520 --> 09:59.790
<b>Such troublemakers...</b>

09:59.790 --> 10:05.260
<b>So we added a locked door to one side.</b>

10:05.920 --> 10:09.310
<b>The intruders take the key 
from the helpless guard,</b>

10:09.310 --> 10:12.000
<b>and then Mike eats them.</b>

10:12.430 --> 10:14.590
<b><i>A locked door...</i></b>

10:14.590 --> 10:15.260
<b>That's it!</b>

10:17.360 --> 10:20.850
<b>As you just realized, I'm not a guard.</b>

10:20.850 --> 10:23.760
<b>I merely clean up after Mike.</b>

10:24.270 --> 10:26.770
<b>And the actual gate isn't locked!</b>

10:27.210 --> 10:28.270
<b>Exactly.</b>

10:28.550 --> 10:29.730
<b>What?</b>

10:32.020 --> 10:42.120
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

10:38.070 --> 10:42.120
<b>Lamentation Tours</b>

11:07.660 --> 11:09.970
<b>I've tried pushing and pulling, 
but it won't budge!</b>

11:09.970 --> 11:11.900
<b>Are you sure it isn't locked?</b>

11:11.900 --> 11:14.440
<b>You just aren't strong enough.</b>

11:14.440 --> 11:15.340
<b>That's absurd!</b>

11:15.340 --> 11:17.070
<b>I've been using all of my strength!</b>

11:20.880 --> 11:22.490
<b>Just watch.</b>

11:26.950 --> 11:30.330
<b>This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.</b>

11:30.330 --> 11:33.750
<b>Anyone who cannot open this gate</b>

11:35.790 --> 11:39.380
<b>is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.</b>

11:54.830 --> 11:58.390
<b>As you just saw, the door closes automatically,</b>

11:58.390 --> 12:01.110
<b>so you'll want to run in, the second it opens.</b>

12:01.490 --> 12:03.340
<b>You don't need to worry about Mike.</b>

12:03.340 --> 12:08.660
<b>He has orders not to attack any who 
enter through the Testing Gate.</b>

12:09.360 --> 12:13.700
<b>Still, this is getting tougher as I age...</b>

12:13.700 --> 12:16.230
<b>But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate,</b>

12:16.230 --> 12:17.420
<b>so I need to keep in shape.</b>

12:18.150 --> 12:22.380
<b>I should mention that each of gate 
one's doors weighs two tons.</b>

12:22.380 --> 12:23.770
<b>Two tons?</b>

12:23.770 --> 12:26.380
<b>You're not supposed to be able to open that!</b>

12:26.380 --> 12:27.930
<b>Wait, what did you say?</b>

12:27.930 --> 12:30.050
<b>Gate one?</b>

12:30.050 --> 12:32.940
<b>Yes, have a look.</b>

12:33.280 --> 12:35.760
<b>There are seven gates.</b>

12:36.360 --> 12:40.230
<b>When you go up a gate, the weight doubles.</b>

12:40.230 --> 12:40.940
<b>Doubles?</b>

12:41.380 --> 12:44.700
<b>The number of gates that open depends</b>

12:44.700 --> 12:47.280
<b>on the amount of strength you use.</b>

12:48.360 --> 12:52.210
<b>Incidentally, when young Killua returned,</b>

12:52.210 --> 12:55.210
<b>he opened gates one through three.</b>

12:55.620 --> 12:57.430
<b>Gate three?</b>

12:57.910 --> 12:59.300
<b>That would be twelve tons!</b>

12:59.300 --> 13:01.200
<b>Sixteen tons, Gon.</b>

13:03.060 --> 13:04.560
<b>Do you understand now?</b>

13:04.560 --> 13:07.570
<b>This is what's required just 
to get in the door.</b>

13:07.570 --> 13:10.120
<b>They live in a completely different world.</b>

13:10.120 --> 13:12.730
<b>Hmm, I don't like it.</b>

13:13.250 --> 13:14.980
<b>Mister, lend me the key.</b>

13:15.580 --> 13:20.230
<b>I came here to see my friend, 
not to be tested.</b>

13:20.230 --> 13:22.480
<b>You can consider me an intruder.</b>

13:22.880 --> 13:24.920
<b>So let me borrow the key.</b>

13:24.920 --> 13:27.260
<b>I'll use the intruder's door.</b>

13:27.260 --> 13:28.180
<b>Gon!</b>

13:28.180 --> 13:29.490
<b>Hey...</b>

13:29.970 --> 13:32.080
<b>It doesn't matter if you 
won't loan me the key.</b>

13:32.080 --> 13:34.750
<b>I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes.</b>

13:35.100 --> 13:36.750
<b>Don't be stupid, Gon!</b>

13:36.750 --> 13:38.380
<b>Didn't you see that monster?</b>

13:38.900 --> 13:42.080
<b>Its arm was bigger than your entire body!</b>

13:42.080 --> 13:43.630
<b>I won't accept this!</b>

13:45.420 --> 13:47.440
<b>Why would you test your friends?</b>

13:48.020 --> 13:50.430
<b>I'll never enter through that door.</b>

13:50.430 --> 13:53.860
<b>You are absolutely right.</b>

13:53.860 --> 13:57.100
<b>However, forcing your way 
through is impossible.</b>

13:57.100 --> 13:58.900
<b>Mike will kill you.</b>

13:59.250 --> 14:01.010
<b>I agree.</b>

14:01.010 --> 14:02.260
<b>We have plenty of time.</b>

14:02.260 --> 14:04.650
<b>Let's figure out a way to 
enter through gate one.</b>

14:09.660 --> 14:10.750
<b>It's no use.</b>

14:10.750 --> 14:13.310
<b>He's not gonna change his mind.</b>

14:13.310 --> 14:14.660
<b>Indeed...</b>

14:15.030 --> 14:18.720
<b>Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key.</b>

14:19.290 --> 14:24.420
<b>I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.</b>

14:24.970 --> 14:27.800
<b>Well, please wait here for a minute.</b>

14:33.660 --> 14:36.180
<b>Hello? This is Zebro.</b>

14:36.550 --> 14:39.090
<b>Three of young Killua's</b>

14:39.090 --> 14:43.690
<b>friends are here to see him.</b>

14:44.050 --> 14:44.950
<b>Yes.</b>

14:44.950 --> 14:47.380
<b>Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes.</b>

14:47.380 --> 14:50.180
<b>Yes, I understand. Yes.</b>

14:50.180 --> 14:53.200
<b>I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.</b>

14:53.830 --> 14:56.380
<b>Yep, I got in trouble.</b>

14:56.380 --> 14:58.370
<b>You called the mansion?</b>

14:58.370 --> 15:02.080
<b>No, I was speaking with the 
Zoldyck family butler.</b>

15:02.080 --> 15:06.030
<b>All communication with the mansion 
must go through the butler.</b>

15:06.030 --> 15:08.880
<b>It's very difficult to reach any 
of the family members.</b>

15:10.110 --> 15:12.230
<b>Could you call him again?</b>

15:12.230 --> 15:13.970
<b>I'll talk to him this time.</b>

15:14.420 --> 15:16.240
<b>Sure, I guess...</b>

15:16.240 --> 15:18.980
<b>But you won't enjoy the experience.</b>

15:23.880 --> 15:25.730
<b>Yes, this is the butler's office.</b>

15:26.120 --> 15:29.310
<b>I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends.</b>

15:29.310 --> 15:31.640
<b>Is Killua-kun there?</b>

15:33.470 --> 15:36.240
<b>Killua-sama has no friends.</b>

15:48.800 --> 15:50.740
<b>Yes, this is the butler's office.</b>

15:52.300 --> 15:54.650
<b>How could you possibly know that?!</b>

15:54.650 --> 15:56.310
<b>Put Killua on the phone!</b>

15:59.100 --> 16:02.190
<b>I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?</b>

16:02.190 --> 16:02.810
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:03.530 --> 16:07.480
<b>Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens 
to have a friend named Gon.</b>

16:07.480 --> 16:10.150
<b>There is no proof that you are Gon.</b>

16:10.150 --> 16:12.500
<b>If you put Killua on the phone, 
he'll recognize me!</b>

16:12.500 --> 16:13.890
<b>By your voice?</b>

16:13.890 --> 16:15.570
<b>That isn't a reliable test.</b>

16:15.940 --> 16:18.200
<b>If you put Killua on the phone, 
he'll recognize me!</b>

16:19.360 --> 16:21.530
<b>That was a simple recording.</b>

16:21.530 --> 16:24.580
<b>And there are many other ways 
to mimic a person's voice.</b>

16:25.900 --> 16:28.960
<b>Next, you'll claim that he'd 
recognize you by sight.</b>

16:30.090 --> 16:31.660
<b>There are only a few methods</b>

16:31.660 --> 16:34.890
<b>by which you could perfectly mimic 
someone's appearance.</b>

16:34.890 --> 16:37.110
<b>But it still isn't impossible.</b>

16:38.310 --> 16:43.620
<b>Additionally, it's possible that someone 
forced you to approach Killua-sama</b>

16:43.920 --> 16:45.350
<b>for sinister purposes.</b>

16:45.850 --> 16:47.850
<b>As long as the threat exists,</b>

16:47.850 --> 16:49.860
<b>I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.</b>

16:53.390 --> 16:56.910
<b>The Zoldyck family practices the 
trade of assassination.</b>

16:56.910 --> 16:58.680
<b>Naturally, it has made enemies.</b>

16:59.560 --> 17:02.300
<b>As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters</b>

17:02.300 --> 17:04.090
<b>from their enemies.</b>

17:04.640 --> 17:06.920
<b>I apologize, but please leave.</b>

17:12.400 --> 17:13.920
<b>Hey! Gon!</b>

17:14.680 --> 17:15.680
<b>Gon!</b>

17:18.940 --> 17:20.680
<b>He's really pissed now.</b>

17:20.680 --> 17:23.780
<b>He's going to climb over the wall...</b>

17:23.780 --> 17:24.690
<b>What?</b>

17:27.500 --> 17:29.560
<b>Hey! Stop it, Gon!</b>

17:29.560 --> 17:31.790
<b>It's okay. You two can wait here.</b>

17:31.790 --> 17:33.140
<b>I'll go by myself.</b>

17:33.140 --> 17:34.700
<b>I can't let you do that!</b>

17:34.700 --> 17:35.720
<b>I'll be fine!</b>

17:35.720 --> 17:36.700
<b>No, you won't!</b>

17:37.040 --> 17:39.060
<b>Both of you should calm down!</b>

17:39.060 --> 17:40.120
<b>I'm perfectly calm!</b>

17:40.680 --> 17:42.270
<b>Come down here, Gon!</b>

17:42.270 --> 17:44.330
<b>Don't be stupid.</b>

17:44.330 --> 17:47.010
<b>Gon-kun, I'll give you the key.</b>

17:47.010 --> 17:49.370
<b>You can go through the door.</b>

17:49.370 --> 17:50.960
<b>Hold on, pops!</b>

17:50.960 --> 17:53.170
<b>We can convince Gon to stop!</b>

17:53.170 --> 17:54.300
<b>Really?</b>

17:54.300 --> 17:56.840
<b>But he appears to be a stubborn boy.</b>

17:57.320 --> 17:58.490
<b>To make amends,</b>

17:58.490 --> 18:01.850
<b>I'll accompany you through the door.</b>

18:02.530 --> 18:03.600
<b>Huh?</b>

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
<b>It's possible that Mike</b>

18:05.920 --> 18:10.370
<b>may recognize me and decide not to attack.</b>

18:10.370 --> 18:14.610
<b>Though I'm almost a hundred percent 
certain that he'll kill us all.</b>

18:15.810 --> 18:17.270
<b>You can't do that.</b>

18:17.270 --> 18:19.110
<b>I don't want to cause you any trouble.</b>

18:19.500 --> 18:21.300
<b>No, I'm coming with you.</b>

18:21.300 --> 18:23.370
<b>The result will be the same if I stay behind.</b>

18:23.770 --> 18:26.940
<b>If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,</b>

18:26.940 --> 18:30.000
<b>I'd never be able to face him again.</b>

18:30.000 --> 18:31.880
<b>If you die,</b>

18:32.410 --> 18:34.380
<b>I will also die.</b>

18:40.520 --> 18:41.970
<b>I understand now.</b>

18:42.440 --> 18:45.530
<b>I didn't stop to consider your situation.</b>

18:45.530 --> 18:46.890
<b>Sorry.</b>

18:50.330 --> 18:51.880
<b><i>He's a good boy.</i></b>

18:51.880 --> 18:55.990
<b><i>He's willing to quell his own anger 
for another person's sake.</i></b>

18:57.430 --> 18:59.860
<b><i>He believes in his own strength,</i></b>

18:59.870 --> 19:02.510
<b><i>as well as in his friends.</i></b>

19:02.510 --> 19:04.410
<b><i>He has a strong heart.</i></b>

19:05.020 --> 19:08.410
<b><i>It's likely that Mike 
won't frighten him at all.</i></b>

19:09.250 --> 19:11.560
<b>You must like animals, Gon-kun.</b>

19:12.740 --> 19:13.790
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:14.140 --> 19:15.340
<b>Just as I thought.</b>

19:15.340 --> 19:18.720
<b>Did you grow up playing in the countryside?</b>

19:18.720 --> 19:20.800
<b>Yep! How did you know?</b>

19:21.220 --> 19:25.310
<b>Gon-kun, I'm going to open 
the Testing Gate again.</b>

19:25.740 --> 19:29.110
<b>I want you to see Mike for yourself.</b>

19:38.840 --> 19:39.840
<b>Hey...</b>

19:39.840 --> 19:42.190
<b>Is it really okay for us to come in?</b>

19:42.190 --> 19:45.790
<b>Yes, you'll be safe because you 
entered through the Testing Gate.</b>

19:45.790 --> 19:49.260
<b>Mike! Come here!</b>

20:31.280 --> 20:34.060
<b>Gon-kun, do you understand now?</b>

20:34.060 --> 20:37.880
<b>This is a trained hunting dog.</b>

20:38.900 --> 20:44.170
<b>It's nothing like the wild animals 
you're accustomed to.</b>

20:45.000 --> 20:48.150
<b>You must have expected to be able 
to communicate with him.</b>

20:48.150 --> 20:50.140
<b>Until you saw his eyes.</b>

20:51.530 --> 20:52.640
<b>Mike is currently</b>

20:53.130 --> 20:57.400
<b>memorizing the appearances and 
scents of humans he's never seen.</b>

20:57.400 --> 21:00.410
<b>There's nothing else on his mind.</b>

21:00.410 --> 21:02.530
<b>He's like a machine.</b>

21:03.380 --> 21:06.770
<b>Gon-kun, could you fight him?</b>

21:07.920 --> 21:09.530
<b>No, I'm scared.</b>

21:09.530 --> 21:11.540
<b>I don't want to fight him!</b>

21:13.780 --> 21:16.540
<b><i>He's such an honest boy.</i></b>

21:17.550 --> 21:20.420
<b>Well, how long will you be here?</b>

21:20.780 --> 21:22.210
<b>Until we meet Killua!</b>

21:22.570 --> 21:24.950
<b>We won't leave before then!</b>

21:28.400 --> 21:31.040
<b>Then please come this way.</b>

21:36.190 --> 21:37.600
<b>The Testing Gate...</b>

21:37.600 --> 21:38.810
<b>And Mike...</b>

21:39.250 --> 21:41.880
<b>Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family</b>

21:41.880 --> 21:46.610
<b>lives in a completely different world.</b>

21:47.440 --> 21:50.120
<b>However, Gon had promised himself...</b>

21:50.940 --> 21:54.880
<b>No matter what difficulties awaited him,</b>

21:54.880 --> 21:57.900
<b>he would find Killua in the end.</b>

23:24.990 --> 23:27.460
<b>Next time: The x Guard's x Duty!</b>

23:27.460 --> 23:28.840
<b>5 x 5 = 25.</b>

23:29.300 --> 23:31.220
<b>So you know how to do math.</b>

23:31.220 --> 23:33.760
<b>5 x 5 = 25!</b>
