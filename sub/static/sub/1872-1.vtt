02:54:47.887 --> 02:54:51.349
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

02:54:55.061 --> 02:54:58.189
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

02:54:58.398 --> 02:55:01.568
But he's too clever a waterman.

02:55:02.402 --> 02:55:05.697
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

02:55:05.864 --> 02:55:08.157
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

02:55:08.324 --> 02:55:10.368
SAM:
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

02:55:10.535 --> 02:55:13.663
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:16.916
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

02:55:17.876 --> 02:55:20.879
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

02:55:21.045 --> 02:55:22.213
But you're not.

02:55:22.505 --> 02:55:25.008
I'm here to help you.

02:55:25.174 --> 02:55:26.885
I promised Gandalf that I would.

02:55:32.849 --> 02:55:35.560
You can't help me, Sam.

02:55:37.729 --> 02:55:39.439
Not this time.

Get some sleep.

02:55:50.783 --> 02:55:52.911
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

02:55:53.411 --> 02:55:56.205
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

02:55:56.873 --> 02:55:59.083
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

02:55:59.417 --> 02:56:02.337
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

02:56:02.754 --> 02:56:04.756
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

02:56:06.633 --> 02:56:09.469
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:12.639
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

02:56:12.847 --> 02:56:16.142
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

02:56:16.392 --> 02:56:18.603
But you will not see that.

02:56:18.937 --> 02:56:20.355
You are afraid!

02:56:20.605 --> 02:56:23.149
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

02:56:23.441 --> 02:56:26.903
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:33.660
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.433
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

My kin.

02:58:19.057 --> 02:58:21.267
We cross the lake at nightfall.

02:58:21.517 --> 02:58:24.062
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

02:58:24.270 --> 02:58:27.732
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

02:58:28.191 --> 02:58:32.028
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

02:58:32.195 --> 02:58:35.406
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

02:58:35.615 --> 02:58:38.743
And after that, it gets even better.

02:58:39.118 --> 02:58:44.082
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

02:58:44.248 --> 02:58:45.625
That is our road.

02:58:47.210 --> 02:58:50.421
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:52.381
Recover my...

02:58:55.384 --> 02:58:57.386
- We should leave now.
- No.

02:58:57.553 --> 02:59:02.016
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

02:59:02.225 --> 02:59:05.645
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

02:59:05.895 --> 02:59:09.899
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

02:59:10.399 --> 02:59:14.570
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

02:59:16.572 --> 02:59:21.536
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

02:59:22.036 --> 02:59:23.746
Where's Frodo?

02:59:49.355 --> 02:59:51.274
BOROMIR:
None of us should wander alone.

02:59:52.650 --> 02:59:54.777
You, least of all.

02:59:54.986 --> 02:59:57.446
So much depends on you.

02:59:58.489 --> 03:00:00.449
Frodo?

03:00:07.582 --> 03:00:10.126
I know why you seek solitude.

03:00:10.835 --> 03:00:14.297
You suffer. I see it day by day.

03:00:15.089 --> 03:00:18.134
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

03:00:19.677 --> 03:00:22.346
There are other ways, Frodo.

03:00:22.597 --> 03:00:26.392
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

03:00:26.642 --> 03:00:30.396
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

03:00:30.646 --> 03:00:33.691
Warning? Against what?

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:36.027
We're all afraid, Frodo.

03:00:36.235 --> 03:00:39.864
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

03:00:40.114 --> 03:00:43.868
- ...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

03:00:45.661 --> 03:00:48.998
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

03:00:50.541 --> 03:00:52.627
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

03:00:53.836 --> 03:00:57.506
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

03:00:59.342 --> 03:01:02.678
What chance do you think you have?

03:01:02.845 --> 03:01:07.516
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

03:01:07.725 --> 03:01:11.437
And you will beg for death
before the end!

It could have been mine.

It should be mine! Give it to me!
