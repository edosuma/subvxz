00:01.335 --> 00:04.405
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz!

00:04.438 --> 00:06.074
LIAM:
Sir, my name's Liam Cole.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.309
In 186 days, an asteroid's
gonna collide with Earth,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.178
and we're all gonna die.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.345
Previously on Salvation...

00:11.379 --> 00:14.248
This isn't business.
This is my life.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.284
I'm gonna have to lie to her
every single day.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.152
Do you know how awful that is?

00:18.186 --> 00:20.088
AMANDA:
A DoD employee with

00:20.121 --> 00:21.822
high security clearance
was murdered.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.126
He saw a file he wasn't supposed
to see-- Project Atlas.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.827
You know that under
normal circumstances

00:26.860 --> 00:28.429
I would never do some of
the things I've done.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.430
HARRIS: You've made
your choices, Grace.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.299
Now I need to make mine.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.301
All we need is
a working EmDrive,

00:33.334 --> 00:34.502
and I can build it.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.604
Professor Croft, wake up.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.739
The EmDrive, it works.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.374
Someone here hacked us
and killed Lazlo

00:40.408 --> 00:42.276
to cover their tracks.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.312
The EmDrive is no
longer safe at Tanz.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.613
Neither are you.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.748
TANZ:
Grace, this is Theresa,

00:47.781 --> 00:48.849
Lazlo's sister.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.318
THERESA:
It's Tess.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.153
You can call me Tess.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.288
GRACE: You were in love
with her, weren't you?

00:54.322 --> 00:55.456
God, it was you?

00:56.257 --> 00:57.625
You're the mole?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.493
You are like the son
I never had.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.697
It was Croft. That son of
a bitch, they took everything.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.399
Who?

01:05.433 --> 01:06.367
The Russians.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.473
(thunder rumbling)

01:14.475 --> 01:16.610
LIAM: ...and then you had
the kinetic impact...

01:16.644 --> 01:18.512
Croft! It was you?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.880
You're the mole?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.315
You're like the son I never had.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.450
(voices overlapping, echoing)

01:22.483 --> 01:24.885
LIAM: I would rather die
a hero than a traitor.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.154
Leave me alone!

01:26.187 --> 01:28.189
(panting)

01:29.757 --> 01:31.192
Bad dream?

01:31.225 --> 01:32.360
Mm-hmm.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.762
What time did you
get in last night?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.564
Uh, I'm not sure.
It was late.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.466
Darius is working
you way too hard.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.268
You can't keep this up.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
You have to take care
of yourself.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.207
Ow!

01:47.441 --> 01:49.610
Liam, what happened?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.345
Oh, it's nothing.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.482
I was in a rush,
and I ran into something.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.850
Was it an oncoming car?

01:58.719 --> 02:01.155
Liam, what is going on?
Whatever it is, you can talk...

02:01.189 --> 02:02.390
I already told you.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.358
It's no big deal.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.428
Please stop with
the third degree, all right?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.896
All right.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.700
I'm sorry.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.535
I-I got a meeting.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.538
We'll talk later.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.840
I'm fine.
I promise.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.749
(door opens, closes)

02:30.451 --> 02:31.685
(elevator bell dings)

02:37.558 --> 02:39.527
Good morning, sir.
He's expecting you.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.598
This is a damn disaster, Harris.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.567
How the hell
did you let this happen?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.473
Morning.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.375
Morning.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.409
How do you want your eggs?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.578
What are you wearing?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.580
I got a job at the diner.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.982
Trying to put away some
extra cash for college.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.484
You're always saying
it's never too late

03:03.517 --> 03:04.485
to plan for the future.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.654
Future.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.489
Right. Good girl.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.823
Hey, are we still on
for dinner tonight

03:09.857 --> 03:10.824
with Grandma and Grandpa?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.426
(sighs)

03:12.460 --> 03:13.527
Mom, no.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.796
You can't cancel again.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.366
Honey, work is just
really insane right now.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.334
Whatever.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.303
Forget it. I'll just
take them to dinner.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.605
No, no, no.
You're right. Come here.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.374
I'm sorry.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.942
I'll be there.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.544
Promise.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.945
Promise.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.915
TANZ:
You all right,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.650
over there?

03:36.684 --> 03:37.985
Great.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.887
Good. Can't dwell
on the past.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.858
I didn't know 12 hours ago
was the past, but all right.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.440
You said your captors
were speaking Russian, yes?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.574
LIAM:
That's correct.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.410
Any particular
dialect?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.577
I'm an astrophysicist.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.313
I'm not a linguist, sir.
I don't know.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.881
So you can't say with certainty
they were Russian agents?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.683
No, no.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.519
HARRIS: At any point,
did they mention

04:11.552 --> 04:12.886
where they were taking
the EmDrive?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.888
Moscow. That-that is all I know.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.457
CLAIRE: We've had
our satellites

04:16.490 --> 04:18.726
monitoring Russian airspace
for the last 12 hours.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.394
No sign of the plane.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.497
Mr. Cole?

04:23.531 --> 04:24.798
LIAM:
Look, I don't know.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.934
He just said Moscow,
that's all I know.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.602
Son, let's cut
to the chase.

04:28.636 --> 04:32.473
The EmDrive-- can you
rebuild it from memory?

04:32.506 --> 04:33.641
My memory isn't the problem.

04:33.674 --> 04:37.511
That drive requires a unique
crystal lining to operate it.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.714
We extracted that crystal from
a meteorite that Darius owns.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.884
And it's the only one
of its kind on Earth.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.954
The most important
one-of-a-kind device

04:46.987 --> 04:48.522
in human history,

04:48.556 --> 04:51.525
and no one at Tanz Industries
even thought

04:51.559 --> 04:53.361
to properly vet the man
building it?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.662
Rehashing the past
and pointing fingers

04:54.695 --> 04:56.597
does little to
stop that asteroid.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.367
We need to focus on potential
solutions, and quickly.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.701
Solutions?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.836
Forgive me, but from
where I'm sitting, Mr. Tanz,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.538
you've given us
nothing but problems.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.474
We gave you $1 billion,

05:06.507 --> 05:09.042
and what do we have
to show for it?

05:09.076 --> 05:11.379
A dead probe
and a stolen EmDrive.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.913
The probe was your call,
and the EmDrive

05:12.946 --> 05:15.449
wouldn't even exist if it wasn't
for us; we created it.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.717
And then you lost it.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.453
I can make things right
if you would just...

05:19.487 --> 05:21.088
I think we've had
enough collaboration

05:21.121 --> 05:22.590
with Tanz Industries
for one lifetime.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.324
Gentlemen.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.529
I couldn't agree more.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.437
Hey, what did you mean
when you said

05:36.470 --> 05:37.571
you can make this right?

05:37.605 --> 05:39.507
You said in there
that my meteorite

05:39.540 --> 05:40.974
was the only source
of the crystal.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.443
Yeah. So?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.680
What if it wasn't?

05:46.714 --> 05:48.716
You'll need
your passport.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.153
Sir, we have to take
immediate action.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.923
Whoever controls the EmDrive
controls the fate of the planet.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.625
Just because the
thieves were Russian

05:57.658 --> 05:58.792
doesn't mean this
was the Kremlin.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.928
It could've been corporate
espionage, for all we know.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.996
Well, what better way
to find these thieves

06:03.030 --> 06:05.032
than by putting
military pressure on Moscow?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.700
What's on the table?

06:06.734 --> 06:07.701
POTUS is prepared

06:07.735 --> 06:09.036
to move the Roosevelt
and Lincoln

06:09.069 --> 06:10.404
into the Baltic as leverage.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.740
You're talking about
moving warships

06:12.773 --> 06:14.141
before pursuing
diplomatic channels.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.676
What am I missing here?

06:18.512 --> 06:20.848
Grace, the deconfliction line
has gone dead.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.050
What?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.818
Russia has shut off
all communication

06:24.852 --> 06:26.520
with the U.S. government.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.688
Since when?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.722
Last night.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.791
Why?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.793
We don't know.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.795
It doesn't make sense.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.730
Why steal the EmDrive?

06:36.764 --> 06:38.666
Why not pool resources,
reach out, give us all

06:38.699 --> 06:40.601
a fighting chance?
We have a common enemy here.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.871
We can speculate all day.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.073
The bottom line is
they stole our technology.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.842
If we hope to get it back,
we need a show of strength here.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.544
Escalation is not the answer.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.613
You're gonna get us all killed
before the asteroid

06:52.646 --> 06:54.014
even gets here.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.716
Secretary Calhoun,
I know the Russian ambassador.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.685
Katya Osinov-- she's a friend.
I can reach out to her.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.520
Sir, all due respect,

06:59.553 --> 07:02.122
Miss Barrows is a press
secretary, not a diplomat.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.657
HARRIS: I don't care
what her title is.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.225
She has the relationship.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.760
And Miss Barrows has

07:06.794 --> 07:09.530
proven herself quite resourceful
on this task force.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.669
All right, Miss Barrows,

07:15.703 --> 07:18.572
try and build that bridge,
but do it quickly.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.140
Meantime, Harris,
I want every satellite,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.775
every possible resource

07:21.809 --> 07:24.678
devoted to finding the plane
carrying that EmDrive.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.547
Yes, sir.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.888
(phone ringing, vibrating)

07:42.262 --> 07:43.964
Hey, Jillian.
What's going on?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.800
Remember when you said
if I ever needed a friend?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.702
I think today's my day.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.739
Are you free for lunch?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.473
Absolutely.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.288
KATYA:
Don't turn around.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.224
Sorry, I can't sit.
They may be watching.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.960
Katya, I wouldn't have
reached out,

08:12.993 --> 08:15.295
but the deconfliction line's
gone dead.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.730
There's been
an incident.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.299
My government stole
your technology.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.535
They won't admit it,
but they're determined

08:21.569 --> 08:23.737
to keep it at all costs.

08:23.771 --> 08:24.672
What is this thing, Grace?

08:24.705 --> 08:26.273
What did they take?
Some kind of weapon?

08:26.306 --> 08:29.810
It's not a weapon,
but it's important enough

08:29.843 --> 08:32.245
that the U.S. is on the verge
of military action.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.248
There has to be a way to bring
our countries to the table.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.684
No.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.185
Katya, I don't understand.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.820
Neither do I, Grace.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.724
Whatever we stole from you
is retribution.

08:43.757 --> 08:46.159
Retribution for what?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.161
Something called Atlas.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.565
It's the reason
they won't negotiate.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.835
Atlas.
Do you know what that is?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.103
No.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.872
If you know something, Grace,
please tell me.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.979
I know you should go home
and hug your daughter.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.817
Every day. We both should.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.921
Take care, friend.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.856
I fear for all of us.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.861
CALHOUN:
Retribution?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.130
Yes, that was
her exact word.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.999
Retribution for what?

09:28.702 --> 09:29.803
What's Atlas?

09:29.837 --> 09:30.971
HARRIS:
Grace,

09:31.004 --> 09:33.240
don't say that word to anybody,

09:33.273 --> 09:34.608
ever.

09:38.779 --> 09:39.980
Grace.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.815
She didn't know.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.050
Or couldn't say.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.385
What exactly did she say,
Miss Barrows?

09:45.418 --> 09:49.690
That the Russians don't
trust us, and never will.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.025
(knock on door)

09:52.059 --> 09:53.093
Yes?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.995
Sir, we've located
the plane.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.730
Let's see it.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.098
DEXTER: One of our
satellites tracked it

09:58.131 --> 09:59.900
to a remote airstrip
in Siberia.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
Seems they landed to refuel
and got caught

10:01.969 --> 10:02.803
in a storm.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.337
When's the weather
supposed to clear?

10:04.371 --> 10:05.773
36 hours.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.974
That doesn't give us much time.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.842
Time for what?

10:08.876 --> 10:10.277
Harris, I want
a risk assessment from JSOC

10:10.310 --> 10:11.278
for a Special Forces incursion.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.813
Yes, sir.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.347
Claire, you're with me.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.650
I need to brief
POTUS right away.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.617
(sighs)

10:17.651 --> 10:20.153
Ground troops?
To a Russian military base?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.321
They've left us no choice.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.856
Harris,

10:22.890 --> 10:24.391
this is beyond a show of force.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.827
You're talking about
World War III.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.101
*

10:47.314 --> 10:48.348
HARRIS: Grace?
GRACE: What?

10:48.381 --> 10:51.318
The Russians don't want war
any more than we do.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.754
You don't know that.
They don't trust us, Harris.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.756
One wrong move,
and we're all blown to pieces.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.325
And you, you're just standing
there, letting it happen.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.293
Grace, he's the secretary
of defense.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.830
I can't overrule him,
even if I wanted to.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.397
We've sacrificed everything
for this mission.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.800
Everything:
our families, each other.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.703
And for what? To have it all end
by blowing ourselves up?

11:09.737 --> 11:10.804
No.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.372
Wait.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.807
Where are you going?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.275
Home.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.345
To be with my daughter
while there's still time.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.414
(door closes)

11:28.455 --> 11:30.257
TANZ (recorded): You've reached
the personal voice mail

11:30.290 --> 11:31.258
of Darius Tanz.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.826
If you have this number,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.862
it's 'cause you're
very important to me.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.464
Darius, where are you?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.301
(classical music playing)

11:44.337 --> 11:46.006
LIAM:
Branson?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.107
No.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.408
Beckham?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.410
Connery?
Stop guessing.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.245
Then just tell me
who we're here to see

11:52.279 --> 11:54.047
and what they have to do
with the crystal and...

11:54.081 --> 11:55.082
NICHOLAS:
Darius?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.350
Stop talking,
start listening.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.419
Darius!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.487
Nicholas.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.890
When my aide said
you would make an appearance,

12:02.923 --> 12:04.124
I thought he was mistaken.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.026
I happened to be
in the neighborhood.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.229
Uh, Nicholas Tanz, this is
Liam Cole, my newest protégé.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.998
Nicholas is my...

12:11.031 --> 12:14.034
Uncle. I know. I've, uh,
I've read your biography.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.236
Unauthorized biography.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.438
Well, they got most of it right.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.508
Uh, tell me, Liam,

12:21.541 --> 12:23.376
where do you hail from?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245
Uh, Rhode Island, sir.
Providence.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.313
NICHOLAS:
Family's from there?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.281
LIAM: Yeah, my-my mother's
there. She's a nurse.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.450
Oh. And your father?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.352
Yeah, uh, he was not
in the picture.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.386
Oh.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.356
Then you and Darius
have something in common.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.326
Liam got a full ride
at university.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.829
He's a very gifted scientist.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.831
Well, then you have
something else in common.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.098
Full ride, I mean.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
(Tanz chuckles)

12:46.599 --> 12:47.935
That's right.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.970
Nicholas put me through MIT.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.238
Raised him like a son.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.040
And how does he repay me?

12:53.073 --> 12:55.475
By setting up shop
an entire ocean away.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.444
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

12:57.477 --> 13:00.380
(quietly):
Yeah.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.216
So, anyway, Liam's an expert
on space rocks.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.919
I thought you might enjoy
showing him your collection.

13:05.953 --> 13:06.987
Oh.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.424
Liam, anything you may have seen
at Tanz Industries

13:11.458 --> 13:13.894
will pale by
comparison.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.362
Come on. Ready for
the grand tour?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.897
LIAM:
Yes, absolutely.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.567
(exhales)

13:23.603 --> 13:26.273
So, your boss just lets you
eat in his office?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.474
(laughs)

13:27.507 --> 13:29.843
"Boss" is too strong a word.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.411
He was just promoted.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.981
And he's on vacay.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.450
So, what's going on?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.120
Sounded pretty rattled
on the phone.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.555
Liam and I got in a fight
this morning.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.324
He's just been acting...

13:45.959 --> 13:47.460
...really strange.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.329
"Strange" how?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.366
Come on.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.567
What are friends for?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.405
He had this bruise on him,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.908
and he gave me
some lame explanation.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.943
And all of
my alarm bells

14:02.976 --> 14:05.445
are going off, and I just...

14:05.478 --> 14:07.580
I feel like he's in danger.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.217
I know.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.052
I must sound crazy to you.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.553
Jillian,

14:13.586 --> 14:16.556
I don't think you're crazy.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.091
I think you're right.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.461
What?

14:21.494 --> 14:24.131
I've been following a story
at Tanz Industries.

14:24.164 --> 14:28.468
And it involves
the government and Darius Tanz

14:28.501 --> 14:30.503
and your boyfriend.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.305
What kind of story?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.941
The kind
that gets people killed.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.948
Converted the old
stables, I see.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.215
NICHOLAS:
Right.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.052
Well, since you left,
I've developed a taste

14:45.085 --> 14:48.521
for things with a bit more
speed than the ponies offer.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.690
(laughs softly)
Wow.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.525
Ah.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.562
The 1967 Maserati Mistral.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.531
The engine under
that hood

14:58.565 --> 15:01.434
won eight Grand Prix
in the late '50s.

15:01.468 --> 15:06.173
But that is nothing
compared to this beauty.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.309
The Khatyrka meteorite.

15:09.342 --> 15:15.082
It hit our atmosphere at
155,000 miles per hour.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.985
For someone
who deals in minerals,

15:18.018 --> 15:22.222
it's really something,
a one-of-a-kind stone.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.258
Hmm.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.461
I gave Darius a small chunk

15:28.495 --> 15:29.997
when he left.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
To remind him of home.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.333
TANZ:
Home...

15:33.366 --> 15:34.601
away from home.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.336
My parents were from London.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.638
Settled in Philly
when I was a young boy.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.441
Nicholas generously
brought me back here

15:41.474 --> 15:43.210
for my schooling.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.346
You know, I think this would
make the perfect centerpiece

15:46.379 --> 15:49.582
for a new exhibit I'm putting
together for the Smithsonian.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.520
Perhaps you would allow them
to display it, on loan?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.756
You know, it's a funny thing.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.659
I've had this rock for years.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.362
No fuss, no fanfare.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.532
(chuckles)
But then, just yesterday,

16:05.565 --> 16:08.768
Ivan Petrenko made me
an eight-figure offer

16:08.801 --> 16:10.670
for the paperweight.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.305
The very next day,

16:12.339 --> 16:15.242
Darius Tanz lands
on my doorstep,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.677
and does the same.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.446
What are the odds?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.082
Clearly, it's, uh...

16:22.115 --> 16:26.153
something very special
about this rock.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.490
Something that would warrant you
venturing all the way up here,

16:30.523 --> 16:31.724
after all these years.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.561
What if I told you

16:34.594 --> 16:36.796
it was important to me?

16:36.829 --> 16:42.502
More or less important than it
was for me that we be partners?

16:42.535 --> 16:45.572
Don't act sentimental, Nicholas;
it doesn't suit you.

16:45.605 --> 16:50.743
It's always been about a number
with you, so... let's have it.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.581
Perhaps that's the something
that we have in common.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.616
The answer is no.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.255
You're just
as I remember you, Uncle.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.523
(chuckles)

17:03.556 --> 17:05.692
A real son of a bitch.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.660
I really must get back
to my guests.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.730
Thank you for
dropping in, Liam.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.265
It's been a pleasure.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.700
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.270
Good-bye, Darius.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.738
Bye-bye.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.775
What the hell
was that?

17:22.809 --> 17:25.278
You didn't even try to convince
him; you just insulted him.

17:25.312 --> 17:28.181
Darius, I do not give a
damn about what kind of...

17:28.215 --> 17:30.383
daddy or, uh, uncle
issues you have.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.552
You got to apologize,
you got to beg.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.521
Nicholas would never sell to me.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.090
He'd sooner
watch the world burn.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.426
Well, if you knew that already,
what the hell are we doing here?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.797
Let's call it... reconnaissance.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.267
LIAM: Reconnaissance
for what?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.868
Darius, what are you gonna do?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
I'm gonna steal it.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.314
JANICE:
Chinese takeout.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.551
Oh, Gracie, we really should
get you a cooking class.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.685
Please, as if she has time.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.787
The woman's never here.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.357
Press office
suddenly become a 24/7 job.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.693
Really? So they're having
press conferences at night now?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.594
(chuckles)

18:14.627 --> 18:18.331
You know,
just can't get it all done.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.732
(phone vibrating)

18:19.766 --> 18:20.833
No, Mom.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.669
Zoe.
(sighs)

18:22.702 --> 18:25.205
No phones at the table
is your rule.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.406
Just during dinner,

18:26.439 --> 18:27.807
please.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.742
Okay, you're right.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.745
Who is it that keeps calling
at this hour?

18:32.779 --> 18:33.813
Are you seeing someone, Grace?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.248
What? No.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.516
Well, honey,

18:36.549 --> 18:38.318
you know, Mike has moved on.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.819
Don't you think
it's time that

18:39.852 --> 18:41.321
you let another man
into the picture?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.755
Mother, please.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.823
HUGH:
So, Zoe,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.358
when are you leaving for Kenya?

18:45.392 --> 18:47.894
Uh, four weeks.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.762
But I'm ready to go now.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.168
Ed can be a
real buzzkill,

18:55.202 --> 18:58.738
but at least he's got
great taste in whiskey.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.240
Isn't it possible

19:00.273 --> 19:02.209
you're seeing something
you want to see?

19:02.242 --> 19:04.811
So forget all the
strange things

19:04.844 --> 19:06.779
that have happened
since Tanz and the DoD

19:06.813 --> 19:08.515
have forged this
new partnership.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.352
Doesn't it strike you as odd
that the great and powerful

19:12.385 --> 19:15.522
Darius Tanz gave an exclusive
to little old me?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.723
Mm. Didn't want to say anything.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.491
You won't hurt
my feelings.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.293
I'm a nobody. For now.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.828
But Darius knows that.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.331
It's a misdirect
to throw me off the scent.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.765
From what?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.967
I'm not sure. Not yet.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.370
But whatever it is, it's
big enough that someone tried

19:30.403 --> 19:32.772
to run me over
to shut me up.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.807
You got hit by a car?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.944
(sighs)

19:37.977 --> 19:40.947
And here's what I think
that they're afraid of.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.449
JILLIAN: Two kids?
Not the kids,

19:42.482 --> 19:44.451
the rock with Tanz
technology in it.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.386
What is it?
I don't know.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.521
Whatever it is,

19:48.555 --> 19:50.590
a Pentagon employee
was murdered over it.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.325
His name was Walter Carnahan.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.527
He was a friend
of Grace Barrows.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.963
DoD press secretary and liaison

19:56.996 --> 19:58.565
to Tanz Industries.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.234
Uh, Grace, this
is Jillian Hayes.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.935
We need to talk, now.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.604
Yeah, okay.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.874
And you're saying that Liam
is in the middle of all of this?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.476
Mm-hmm.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.347
But if I can expose the truth,
I might be able to protect him.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.415
How?

20:15.448 --> 20:16.716
It's important
that we get him

20:16.749 --> 20:18.851
on the right side
of this thing.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.820
So maybe you could see
what he knows,

20:20.853 --> 20:24.023
or see what you could
find out for yourself.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.426
You want me to be a spy?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.961
No. I want you to be a source.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.833
(water running)

20:33.866 --> 20:34.834
You look terrible.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.835
(laughs softly)

20:35.868 --> 20:37.270
Thanks, Daddy.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.339
Just like your old man.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.807
Workaholic.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.775
Chip off the old block.

20:42.809 --> 20:43.843
(doorbell rings)

20:43.876 --> 20:46.846
ZOE:
I got it.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.415
Gracie.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.949
What's going on?

20:52.419 --> 20:55.588
You of all people
should know not to ask.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.424
Fair enough.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.025
ZOE:
Um, Mom?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.393
You have a visitor.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.528
H-Hi.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.830
Sorry to intrude.

21:03.863 --> 21:08.968
Uh, Dad, Zoe,
this is Darius Tanz.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.670
JANICE:
So...

21:10.703 --> 21:12.605
you do have a boyfriend.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.541
Mother.
He's not my boyfriend.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.876
Not yet.
She likes to play hard to get.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.878
I bet she learned that
from you, didn't she?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.580
(chuckles)

21:20.613 --> 21:23.316
We work together.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.718
A joint collaboration
with the DoD and my company.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.455
Your daughter's been a
tremendous asset to the project.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.889
Which is why I'm here.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.524
Pressing problem.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.597
Sorry for barging in,
but your phone was off.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.632
Darius, they found the plane
with the EmDrive

21:39.666 --> 21:41.100
on a Russian airstrip
in the Arctic.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.670
Calhoun's sending in
Special Forces in 36 hours.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.538
Ground troops on Russian soil?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.640
That's... that's madness.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.008
The deconfliction line is dead.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.777
They're out of options.
No.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.614
They're not. I have a way of
rebuilding the EmDrive, but...

21:54.647 --> 21:56.816
But you need my help.
No, no.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.352
I'd like your help,
but it's Harris I really need.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.574
(sighs)

22:32.419 --> 22:34.954
(panting)

22:38.925 --> 22:40.760
(phone ringing, vibrating)

22:42.762 --> 22:43.963
Jillian.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.031
JILLIAN:
Amanda.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.033
You were wrong.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.836
There's nothing going on here.
I couldn't find anything.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.440
I-I got to go.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.707
(line clicks)

22:58.478 --> 23:00.580
Jillian?

23:00.613 --> 23:03.450
Liam, I need to know
what's going on.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.887
Now.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.663
This is blood on your clothes.

23:16.696 --> 23:21.200
A lot of blood.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.004
If you're in some sort of
trouble, Amanda said

23:25.037 --> 23:26.773
she would be able
to help you.
Amanda?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.040
From Capitol Eyes?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.876
Yeah, we've become friends.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.111
The only person
Amanda wants to help is Amanda.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.914
She's a reporter.
She's just looking for red meat.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.148
Least she's honest with me.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.587
What is going on, Liam?

23:40.620 --> 23:43.790
If I don't get
a straight answer...

23:43.823 --> 23:45.625
I'm leaving.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.597
Okay, you're gonna want
to sit down for this.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.631
(softly):
Okay.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.032
(sighs)

23:54.834 --> 23:56.769
And for your safety,

23:56.803 --> 23:59.572
you have to promise me
you won't tell a soul.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.143
I shouldn't be here.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.879
Neither should
you, Grace.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.949
Calhoun's ordered an end to
this collaboration, full stop.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.585
I might have something
that will change your mind.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.786
Tess, play back file Recon-1.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.822
HARRIS: All right,
what am I looking at here?

24:15.855 --> 24:18.725
TANZ: 3-D imaging scans
I took of the target

24:18.758 --> 24:19.859
with a contact lens.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.094
That's quite a
security detail.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.563
Whose mansion?

24:23.596 --> 24:25.698
Nicholas Tanz, my uncle.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.734
Okay.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.536
You have my attention.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.369
My crystalline meteorite

24:30.402 --> 24:32.739
that we used
to complete the EmDrive

24:32.772 --> 24:34.941
was only part of a larger piece
that fell to Earth.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.543
A chip off the old rock.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.645
And Nicholas owns the original.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.279
Which he keeps here
in the converted stables,

24:40.312 --> 24:42.582
accessible through
the main hall or...

24:42.615 --> 24:44.651
this service tunnel.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.719
I'm sensing this is
where I come in.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.955
I was hoping you'd be
so kind as to scare us up

24:48.988 --> 24:50.189
some guys with guns.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.624
Please.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.193
(scoffs)

24:54.226 --> 24:55.828
(clears throat)

24:55.862 --> 24:58.130
Okay. You want me
to authorize

24:58.164 --> 25:00.767
a tactical extraction
on U.K. soil

25:00.800 --> 25:03.035
to steal a meteorite
from your own uncle?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.003
Yeah, we can't steal it.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.938
This, uh, thing weighs
at least a few tons.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.139
We're gonna have to

25:07.173 --> 25:09.676
extract the crystal from there.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.744
Well, did you ask him nicely?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.179
Well, you know
how family can be.

25:13.212 --> 25:16.048
GRACE: If we can get
the crystal from Nicholas,

25:16.082 --> 25:18.150
we can rebuild our own EmDrive.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.653
And there's no need
to send troops to Russia.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.722
GRACE: Harris, we
can prevent war.

25:22.755 --> 25:23.590
But time's running out.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.157
Please, you got to
convince Calhoun.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.694
No, no.
Calhoun will never go for this.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.064
We'll have to do it ourselves.

25:41.774 --> 25:45.311
An asteroid is coming
in 148 days.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.680
Croft is a spy
for the Russians.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.716
And you...

25:49.749 --> 25:51.684
killed him.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.988
You realize
how insane you sound?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.990
(sighs)

25:58.024 --> 26:00.627
Yeah.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.862
But it's the truth.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.633
(sobbing softly)

26:11.303 --> 26:13.673
Look, I was trying to
protect you from all this.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.974
Protect me?

26:15.007 --> 26:17.644
Liam, how could you
keep this from me?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.647
I made a decision.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.849
It's my life.

26:22.882 --> 26:26.853
I get to decide how
I want to live my last days.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.120
Not you.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.025
I realize how overwhelming
all of this is,

26:33.059 --> 26:35.061
but we're working
on the problem.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.697
All right? That's why I'm here.
We're gonna build a new EmDrive.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.365
I got to go.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.868
Where?

26:41.901 --> 26:43.803
Home.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.171
Jillian.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.340
Jillian, Jillian.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.144
Nobody outside
the Pentagon

26:52.178 --> 26:53.680
knows about this,
and if word got out...

26:53.713 --> 26:55.014
Screw you.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.686
(door closes)

27:05.925 --> 27:08.394
Nicholas is leaving for
his weekend retreat.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.263
He'll have half a dozen armed
guards manning the perimeter.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.033
No picnic, but doable
with a properly-equipped team.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.234
H-Hold on.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.236
Let's just say that
I can pull together

27:17.269 --> 27:20.372
weapons, gear and
some former special ops guys.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.143
I can't just waltz them into
the U.K. without being noticed.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.244
Not without help from Langley

27:25.277 --> 27:26.445
or-or the State Department
at least.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.214
GRACE:
Uh...

27:28.247 --> 27:30.717
I may be able
to help out with that.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.886
I know a guy.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.755
HARRIS and TANZ:
You do?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.323
Yes.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.458
(elevator doors open)

27:39.491 --> 27:42.261
TANZ: Liam, perfect timing.
I need you to

27:42.294 --> 27:43.830
draw up instructions
for Harris's team

27:43.863 --> 27:44.997
on how to extract the crystal.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.933
No.

27:46.966 --> 27:47.934
Excuse me?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.469
I'm going. To London.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.971
Okay, Rambo.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.440
Do you want a team
or is this a one-man mission?

27:54.473 --> 27:55.307
Look, I need to
see this through.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.342
Yeah, well, I need you
here with me.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.011
Yeah, well, it's not
your damn decision, is it?

27:59.045 --> 28:01.247
I've given up
everything

28:01.280 --> 28:02.882
to make that drive a reality.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.217
I have, I have lied for it,
I have killed for it,

28:05.251 --> 28:07.720
and now I've lost the woman
I love because of it.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.758
HARRIS: Liam, I'm
with Darius here.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.926
I can't have any liabilities
in the field.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.728
The stakes are too high.
(scoffs)

28:15.762 --> 28:17.930
My guys are quick studies,
with combat experience.

28:17.964 --> 28:21.100
How much time have your guys
spent in a lab?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.235
I'm the only person that has
ever extracted that crystal.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.271
You want to talk about stakes?

28:25.304 --> 28:26.906
What happens if your guy breaks

28:26.939 --> 28:28.407
his only diamond-tipped
drill bit?

28:28.440 --> 28:31.243
Or the extractor overheats
and fuses to the rock?

28:31.277 --> 28:32.745
We are all screwed, that's what.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.114
We only have

28:35.147 --> 28:36.983
one chance.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.218
It's got to be me.
It has to be me.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.221
Fine.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.092
But you follow my orders
to the letter.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.994
Okay? I'm not about
to get us all killed

28:48.027 --> 28:49.929
so you can play hero.
Are we clear?

28:49.962 --> 28:51.931
Yeah, yeah, we're clear.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.465
Your orders?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.001
I'm going with him.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.972
So, this, uh... guy
of yours that you know,

29:00.006 --> 29:01.808
who is he?

29:12.484 --> 29:15.788
(car door opens, closes)

29:15.822 --> 29:17.289
Thanks for coming.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.159
Daddy, you know I
never ask much of you

29:20.192 --> 29:21.961
'cause I knew you couldn't
cross those lines,

29:21.994 --> 29:24.330
but I'm afraid
I have to now.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.898
What can you tell me?

29:25.932 --> 29:28.935
I need to get a plane
into the U.K. undetected.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.803
Private airstrip.
No questions asked.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.505
Will they be armed?

29:35.908 --> 29:39.311
I have a contact. MI6.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.114
Should be able to
smooth the transition.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.184
Send me the plane tail number
and transponder code.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.853
When do you need this?

29:46.886 --> 29:48.187
Now.

29:50.222 --> 29:53.860
Gracie, there were days
that I was sure

29:53.893 --> 29:56.262
the world was gonna
break apart under my feet.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.265
But we're still here.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.968
How did you deal with
all the secrets?

30:02.001 --> 30:05.004
You learn to compartmentalize.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.841
And your mother...
didn't ask many questions.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.976
She learned not to.

30:10.009 --> 30:10.977
Yeah.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.379
She drank instead.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.015
Mm.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.450
I think part of
me always knew

30:18.484 --> 30:21.453
you were more than
a businessman.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.890
It's what I hoped.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.458
Then when you'd leave suddenly
and miss my birthdays,

30:26.492 --> 30:29.161
dance recitals,
it's 'cause...

30:29.195 --> 30:31.030
you were doing something
really important.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.565
Made it easier.

30:33.599 --> 30:37.269
Serving your country,
it's tricky business.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.074
Will Zoe ever forgive me?

30:43.375 --> 30:46.645
Did you? Forgive me?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.014
(sighs)

30:48.047 --> 30:49.581
More than you know.

30:54.386 --> 30:58.657
Whatever you've got going,
good luck.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.426
(door opens)

31:16.042 --> 31:17.143
MAN:
Yo.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.011
Rebel.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.412
It's actually
"Deputy Secretary" now.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.647
Oh.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.282
Excuse me. Come on.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.085
Hey, thanks for
doing this, Griff.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.419
Gents, how we looking?

31:27.453 --> 31:28.520
Wheels up in 20.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.356
Good.
(grunts)

31:30.389 --> 31:32.224
One last thing.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.162
Gel-cased
capacitor ammunition.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.964
Six-round magazine,
holographic sight.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.533
Layman's terms,
this little beastie

31:41.567 --> 31:44.036
fires an electrical charge
like a bullet.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.973
It'll drop anything smaller
than a rhino at up to 200 yards.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.976
Non-lethally, of course.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.944
Nicholas's guards
are not the enemy,

31:51.978 --> 31:53.412
just men doing their job.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.687
Inside is an altitude
and heading.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.489
Tell your pilot
to follow those,

32:03.522 --> 32:05.424
and our contact at MI6
will make sure

32:05.457 --> 32:07.493
the Royal Air Force
turns a blind eye.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.995
You are full of surprises.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.999
Hey.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.001
Don't worry.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.302
I'll be careful.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.475
You sure about this?

32:23.509 --> 32:26.645
Yeah.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.982
Putting yourself in harm's way
isn't gonna bring Jillian back.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.150
This is your fault.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.718
You brought her here.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.253
I had my reasons.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.587
I don't care about your reasons.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.024
I told you I didn't want
to have to lie to her,

32:38.057 --> 32:39.725
but you didn't give a crap.
You destroyed us, Darius.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.696
You're a heartless prick
just like Nicholas.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.545
So, is this retribution?

32:59.578 --> 33:02.681
I don't assume to know
what the Russians want.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.783
Talking about you.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.718
I mean, this
was your home.

33:06.752 --> 33:10.256
Your uncle took you in,
put you through school.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.592
What happened?

33:13.625 --> 33:15.761
Incapable of
finding happiness,

33:15.794 --> 33:19.398
he settled for destroying
everyone around him who could.

33:21.433 --> 33:26.105
And where does Tess
fit into the story?

33:27.773 --> 33:29.741
My father and Nicholas
were business partners.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.243
They had a falling out.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.312
Dad picked up
and moved us all to Philly.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.714
I was seven at the time.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.483
Tess and Lazlo
were my neighbors.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.784
We grew up together.

33:38.817 --> 33:42.321
How'd you end up
living with Nicholas?

33:42.354 --> 33:45.291
My father...

33:45.324 --> 33:47.693
(exhales)
...he drank.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.761
You know, couldn't keep a job.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.731
Nicholas saw something in me
and offered to whisk me away,

33:52.764 --> 33:54.833
boarding school and MIT.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.137
He was... my ticket out.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.772
And Tess?

34:00.806 --> 34:03.242
What about her?

34:03.275 --> 34:06.212
You were in love with her?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.215
Madly.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.518
So, what happened?

34:12.551 --> 34:18.090
Then, um... Nicholas offered me
a-a staggering sum of money

34:18.124 --> 34:21.427
to-to start my-my first
business, and I took it.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.529
What's wrong with that?

34:26.698 --> 34:30.102
In exchange, I agreed
to stop seeing her.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.272
Nicholas thought that

34:33.305 --> 34:36.642
love would get in the way
of my greatness.

34:38.477 --> 34:40.279
I-I was his investment.

34:40.312 --> 34:45.451
He wasn't about to let it
all be squandered over a girl.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.855
He sounds like a monster.

34:49.888 --> 34:54.860
Nick was the serpent
in the garden, but I was...

34:54.893 --> 34:56.862
all too willing
to take the apple.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.901
Liam's right. I am a prick.

35:02.934 --> 35:07.806
The other night, you said
Tess was your greatest regret.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.476
So?

35:10.509 --> 35:12.644
Real pricks don't have regrets.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.792
Well, I bared my soul,
or what's left of it.

35:26.825 --> 35:27.926
Your turn.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.197
Who said I want a turn?

35:31.230 --> 35:33.865
(both laugh)

35:33.899 --> 35:36.368
(computer beeps)

35:36.402 --> 35:37.836
Saved by the ping.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.205
They've touched down.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.839
Here we go.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.375
Tess, activate
surveillance screen.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.677
TESS (automated voice):
Surveillance activated, Darius.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.923
You all right?

35:57.956 --> 35:59.858
Yeah.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.860
Hey, stick to me like glue,
and I'll get us both home safe.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.395
Deal?

36:03.429 --> 36:04.563
Deal.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.598
Go.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.434
TANZ (over earpieces):
Go 20 meters straight.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.735
Right up the stairs.

36:09.768 --> 36:10.869
Hold it there.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.839
Security detail
will be passing you

36:13.872 --> 36:14.940
in ten seconds.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.220
(panting softly)

36:30.956 --> 36:34.293
TANZ: You've got three guards
on the south entrance.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.796
(silenced gunfire)

36:40.732 --> 36:42.468
HARRIS: Let's go.
We've got about 30 minutes

36:42.501 --> 36:43.502
till they wake up.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.909
HARRIS: Garage is
just up ahead. Get ready.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.253
Clear.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.724
Okay, Liam, you're up.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.268
(tool whirring)

37:22.040 --> 37:23.775
Darius.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.777
I thought I
saw something.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.313
Interference?

37:27.346 --> 37:28.614
Hold on.

37:30.782 --> 37:31.883
Harris, you've got company.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.051
I don't know who they are,

37:33.084 --> 37:34.553
but they are headed your way.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.021
All right.
Pack it up. Time to go.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.589
I don't have enough
of the crystal yet.

37:39.057 --> 37:42.027
(guards speaking Russian)

37:43.462 --> 37:45.497
We are out of time, Liam.

37:45.531 --> 37:46.998
Okay, just a few more seconds.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.337
All right. Move out.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.671
All right.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.739
HARRIS:
Package secure.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.906
Moving to exfil.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.643
Wait for us, Liam.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.944
(door opens)
HARRIS: Liam!

37:58.977 --> 37:59.845
Take cover!

37:59.878 --> 38:01.046
(guards shouting)

38:08.587 --> 38:10.589
(shouting, gunfire continue)

38:13.525 --> 38:15.694
HARRIS: Darius,
they're Russian commandos!

38:15.727 --> 38:17.929
Our ground
cams are down.

38:17.963 --> 38:18.930
Harris?

38:18.964 --> 38:19.998
(man speaking Russian)

38:20.031 --> 38:21.367
Can you hear me?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.569
(man speaking Russian)

38:23.602 --> 38:25.404
Harris?

38:32.844 --> 38:34.846

38:36.548 --> 38:38.550
(speaking Russian)

39:06.478 --> 39:08.947
(silenced gunshot)

39:13.752 --> 39:15.387
Come on.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.888
Ride's waiting.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.427
Darius?

39:26.131 --> 39:27.866
(laughs)

39:27.899 --> 39:29.501
They made it.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.736
(laughs):
Yeah.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.771
(sighs)

39:43.949 --> 39:45.451
Hey.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.185
You did good out there.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.522
This could make the
difference for all of us.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.791
You're a real hero, Liam.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.964
Hey, you ever need to talk
to someone about Croft...

40:01.633 --> 40:03.068
...I've been there.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.103
Thanks.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.074
Thought we'd lost you there
for a moment.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.909
Yeah, you and me both.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.944
I reached Calhoun.
They're calling off the dogs.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.785
I don't want to be
without you anymore.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.120
Me, neither.

TANZ:
You were right.

41:05.063 --> 41:10.802
Jillian was a ploy
to motivate you,

41:10.836 --> 41:13.471
manipulate you, at first.

41:16.274 --> 41:20.779
Then I saw something in her,
the same thing you did.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.650
But...

41:24.683 --> 41:28.920
bringing her here
wasn't my choice to make.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.657
Was that an apology?

41:31.690 --> 41:34.693
Uh, an acknowledgment.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.164
You've been through a lot.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.103
Jillian.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.504

42:02.220 --> 42:03.655

42:03.689 --> 42:05.724
Of course.
In terms of a response,

Just look.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.876
NEWSMAN:
...in brazen violation

42:24.910 --> 42:26.878
of several nuclear treaties.

42:26.912 --> 42:30.649
At the same time, the Russian
embassy shuttered its doors

42:30.682 --> 42:33.919
and began moving its employees
out of the country.

42:33.952 --> 42:37.889
Russian Ambassador Katya Osinov
had this to say.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.725
We regret that our government

42:39.758 --> 42:42.127
has had to take
this course of action,

42:42.160 --> 42:44.129
but the Americans know
what they have done

42:44.162 --> 42:45.931
to cause this breakdown
in relations.

We only hope they do not
make any more moves

42:48.266 --> 42:50.636

toward the Russian people.
