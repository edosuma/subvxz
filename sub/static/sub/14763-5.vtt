<i>that make it expand. So--</i>

00:51.318 --> 00:53.819
Great. The bigger we hit,
the bigger he gets.

00:53.821 --> 00:57.256
Avengers, we're gonna
have to rethink our-- Uh-oh.

Huh, Avenger's Assemble. Huh.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.860
[panting]

02:12.465 --> 02:14.733

Now, pull. Timber!

02:42.796 --> 02:45.330
Anybody got a good

Several direct hits to

03:04.685 --> 03:07.619
It's like there's a
scientist in you somewhere.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.620
Hm.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.022
You got anything, Iron Man?

03:10.024 --> 03:12.324
His tech has obviously
been upgraded.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.459
And I find it more
than a little coincidental

03:14.461 --> 03:17.529
since Stark has done advanced
research into Stimuloid systems.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.697
You think the tech's yours?

03:18.699 --> 03:19.998
Stark gear missing...

03:20.000 --> 03:22.367
Teched up things showing
up out of nowhere.

<i>meet your Thunderbolts!</i>

03:28.409 --> 03:29.808
[crowd cheering]

03:29.810 --> 03:32.811
I'm Megan McLaren with
the Bugle News Network.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.347
The Thunderbolts--
are they the exciting,

03:35.349 --> 03:37.349
new heroes the world needs?

03:37.351 --> 03:40.519
Pft, and what are we,
last week's leftovers?

03:40.521 --> 03:43.522
That's how it always is.
Everybody wants something new.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.691
Looks like they even
have their own publicist.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.693
Please, everyone,

03:47.695 --> 03:50.762
just visit the Thunderbolts'
website to get answers
to your questions.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.699
And be sure to follow all
their social media feeds.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.368
Remember, "Justice,
like Lightning!"

03:56.370 --> 03:59.037
"Justice, like Lightning?"
[groans]

03:59.039 --> 04:02.074
Oh, wow! Is that really you?
Can I have your autograph?

04:04.877 --> 04:06.445
Here you go.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.916
Oh, man. I thought you
were Mach IV.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.051
Not sure I trust
the Thunderbolts.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.887
And it's not because
I'm signing fewer autographs.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.889
What I've learned about
the modern world

04:17.891 --> 04:20.024
is that everyone wants
their 10 minutes of fame.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.861
It's 15 minutes.
Even worse.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.932
Friday, time to run complete
diagnostic scans on our
Thunderbolt friends.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.702
Let's find out if we can pick up
any familiar tech signatures.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.739
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

04:33.741 --> 04:34.773

04:34.775 --> 04:36.708
Wow. You guys are
really great.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.412
We just knew we wanted
to dedicate ourselves
to helping people.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.649
<i>Thunderbolts have been</i>
<i>showing up all over</i>
<i>the talk-show circuit.</i>

04:43.651 --> 04:47.619
Oh, c'mon! We save
the city all the time!

04:47.621 --> 04:50.756
I did not think fame
your ultimate goal.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.924
They have an impressive
online presence,

04:52.926 --> 04:56.795
but everything prior to a
few weeks ago looks planted.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.564
And there's nothing
in the secure databases.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.566
Where'd Tony run off to?
[thrusters boom]

05:06.005 --> 05:07.806
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>The Thunderbolts'</i>

05:07.808 --> 05:08.940

<i>from this structure.</i>

05:08.942 --> 05:11.443
Then I guess I need
to find a way in.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.779
Okay, Tony, what's
the idea of freelancing?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.647
I don't trust
the Thunderbolts.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.450
It's all a little
coincidental.
My tech gets stolen,

05:18.452 --> 05:20.619
then a new group of
high-tech heroes shows up?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.621
You sure your ego's
not getting in the way?

05:22.623 --> 05:25.424
I don't have an ego.
Just one more reason
I'm perfect.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.692
[metal breaking]

So much for being just
a plain old warehouse.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.772
[laser beam]
Huh?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.674
You didn't need
to sneak in, Avengers.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.547
Yeah, our publicist can
set up an interview anytime.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.449
I'd rather you talk
to the cops.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.952
About stealing Stark
Industries Technology.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.822
Like nobody else in the world
can make what you make.

05:56.824 --> 06:01.059
Mr. Stark, I'm a huge fan of
your work, but I'm disappointed.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.462
We don't need to steal from you.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.565
Frankly, your stuff is
a little "behind the times."

06:06.567 --> 06:09.034
Is he speaking English?
'Cause I didn't understand

06:09.036 --> 06:10.902
anything after
"fan of your work."

06:10.904 --> 06:12.070
I always wondered

06:12.072 --> 06:14.573
where all the Avengers'
enemies came from.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.007
That android this morning?

06:16.009 --> 06:18.577
It had your signature
all over it.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.913
Not our style. We're not
into faking things for TV.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.516
But your "heroic" group
sure came out of nowhere

06:24.518 --> 06:28.053
to find fame and fortune
by flashing around some
pretty cool powers.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.022
Stolen powers,
based on my scans.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.493
Do you know what you
can do with your scans?

06:34.495 --> 06:38.930
[laughs]
Yeah, I do. In fact,
I'm doing it right now.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.734
Uh, hey, guys. Why don't
we all just take a step back?

06:42.736 --> 06:46.905
You two can take a step all the
way back to where you came from!

<i>Citizen V, your little group</i>
<i>has been poking around</i>
<i>in my business.</i>

07:38.992 --> 07:41.993

We know you've been
stealing tech.

Turn yourself in and
we won't have to come get you.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.567
<i>I haven't stolen anything.</i>

07:48.569 --> 07:51.002
<i>I have friends.</i>
<i>They give me things.</i>

07:51.004 --> 07:55.006
<i>And Tony Stark!</i>
<i>You're here too.</i>
<i>It isn't even my birthday!</i>

07:55.008 --> 07:57.976
I can arrange a nice
surprise party for you.

07:57.978 --> 08:02.581
<i>Don't bother. I'm the one</i>
<i>sending the "presents" today.</i>
<i>And you can't dismantle it.</i>

08:02.583 --> 08:03.849
We'll just see about that!

08:03.851 --> 08:05.750
[screams]

08:05.752 --> 08:08.920
<i>As you can see, it's protected</i>
<i>by a powerful force field.</i>

08:08.922 --> 08:13.124
<i>Which won't stop it, however,</i>
<i>from vaporizing you all.</i>

08:13.126 --> 08:16.094
[revving up]

08:16.096 --> 08:20.265
I guess the surprise is on us.
You really shouldn't have.

08:23.035 --> 08:27.105
The bomb could take out a city
block. No time to evacuate.
I agree.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.108
Maybe we can short out the
force field if we overload it?

08:30.110 --> 08:33.712
It's worth a try.
Let's set up a varying
phase repulsor beam.

[beeps]

08:47.961 --> 08:49.261

that core out!

08:54.902 --> 08:56.101
No time.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.142
Anything I'm holding
phases with me.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.977
Interesting moves, Meteorite.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.679
A-hem! Close call.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.247
Seems we have
a common enemy.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.049
You and I have
nothing in common.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.653
Justin Hammer is my problem.
The Avengers will handle it.

09:22.261 --> 09:26.264
I still think the Thunderbolts
have something to do with
the stolen Stark Tech.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.233
Whatever your suspicions,
we're a team.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.201
You shouldn't
go out alone.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.604
I wasn't alone.
Falcon was with me.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.240
Hey, you would have broken into
that place with or without me.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.275
I trust my team
to always have my back.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.278
I input those coordinates from
your tracking satellites, Tony.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.215
It gives us three probable
locations for Hammer based
on his hologram's signal.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.252
<i>[Captain] We'll have to</i>
<i>surprise him by hitting</i>
<i>them all simultaneously.</i>

09:52.792 --> 09:55.860
I keep saying we need to find
you something less conspicuous

09:55.862 --> 09:58.263
than a red, white,
and blue body suit.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.900
I'm sure there are some tropical
birds here I can blend with.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.969
I think we've arrived.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.971
There's no way in.

We already checked.

Thanks for coming
to back us up.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.288
We're here now.
Go back home

10:23.290 --> 10:25.323
and let the real
heroes do their jobs.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.591
Step aside.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.897
Hold on, Hulk. It could
be booby-trapped.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.425
Hammer's always got something
else up his sleeve.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.396
[roars]

11:08.267 --> 11:10.268
How many sleeves does he have?

11:26.852 --> 11:30.221
[grunts]

11:30.223 --> 11:32.891
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>Hey, we got a big Mandroid</i>
<i>surprise from our bunker.</i>

11:32.893 --> 11:34.225
Same thing here.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.503
[supersonic scream]

11:45.505 --> 11:48.239
Thunderbolts, try to keep them
contained on the right flank.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.076
You heard the Captain!

11:51.078 --> 11:53.011
[roars]

11:53.013 --> 11:55.013
They seem to be
quite persistent.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.582
Let's do something about that.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.097
Huh?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.698
It's actually nice
to have some extra hands

12:13.700 --> 12:15.500
on-deck to deal
with these robots.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.801
[grunts]

12:20.039 --> 12:23.108
We could have handled this
well enough on our own.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.949
[grunts]

12:32.017 --> 12:33.785
We're here to help, Avengers.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.087
No thanks,
we got this.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.623
Hulk, smash them too
if they get in our way.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.991
Gladly.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.495
[roars]

12:47.433 --> 12:49.534
[roars]

12:59.111 --> 13:01.045
[grunts]

13:02.948 --> 13:05.116
And that's the last of them.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.485
Avengers, we've dealt with
the Mandroids at our site.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.788
Scan the bunker
for traps, then go in.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.790
Already there.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.795
We are, too.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.505
It's all Stark Tech.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.808
Of course Hammer had
something to do with it.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.844
Looks like he's been
mass-producing Mandroids.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.781
Same thing here. Tony, your
suspicions about your Tech
being stolen were right.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.917
It's just Hammer
who is stealing it.

13:38.919 --> 13:43.454
Thanks, Cap. Now, let's destroy
all these factories.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.591
<i>Well, well. Who knew the</i>
<i>Avengers and the Thunderbolts</i>

13:46.593 --> 13:48.860
<i>would be such good playmates?</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:52.130
<i>I hate to get rid</i>
<i>of these factories,</i>
<i>but I hate you more.</i>

13:52.132 --> 13:55.767
<i>So I'll destroy them so</i>
<i>you can't acquire any</i>
<i>of my innovations.</i>

13:55.769 --> 13:59.037
I don't need to steal
back my own work.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.972
<i>Obviously the last time</i>
<i>I tried this,</i>

14:00.974 --> 14:03.208
<i>I gave you too much time.</i>

14:03.210 --> 14:05.910
<i>I won't make</i>
<i>that mistake again.</i>

14:13.452 --> 14:17.021
Hammer's blowing up
all his factories!
With us still inside!

14:31.904 --> 14:33.638
Avengers! Thunderbolts!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.039
Move!

14:44.049 --> 14:48.253
[supersonic scream]

14:51.390 --> 14:53.258
[supersonic scream]

14:53.260 --> 14:54.692
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>We're out.</i>
<i>Everybody okay?</i>

14:54.694 --> 14:57.061
Yeah, we're okay,
but we're not happy.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.764
Tony, you got a real
location on Hammer?

14:59.766 --> 15:03.268
I have some rough scans,
but not enough to pinpoint
an exact location.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.836
Running a trace now.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.437
Not bad.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.508
Not bad yourself.
Good smashing.
[Hulk laughs]

15:10.510 --> 15:12.277
I know.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.879
[booms]

15:14.881 --> 15:17.282
If we could help,
I have some information.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.785
I've been aware that
our publicist has been
doing double duty.

15:20.787 --> 15:24.756
<i>I'm just saying, Mr. Hammer,</i>
<i>if you wanted to know about</i>
<i>the Thunderbolts' activities,</i>

15:24.758 --> 15:27.058
<i>for publicity purposes</i>
<i>only, of course,</i>

15:27.060 --> 15:30.128
<i>I might be able to provide</i>
<i>you with, uh, that information.</i>

15:30.130 --> 15:32.463
I never totally trusted her.

15:32.465 --> 15:36.701
Yeah, nobody can get you on the
late night shows that easily.

15:36.703 --> 15:40.138
But having her around meant
I could keep tabs on Hammer.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.474
I'll combine my signal
tracking with your video
call source information.

15:43.476 --> 15:47.445
And... got it!
I'm good.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.619
[thrusters whooshing]

15:54.621 --> 15:56.321
Giant bunker,
right ahead.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.489
<i>I say we announce our</i>
<i>presence with authority.</i>

15:58.491 --> 16:01.159
I like the sound of that.

16:08.434 --> 16:11.669
Split up. Three teams.
And stay alert.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.471
Hammer doesn't know
when he's been beat.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.177
You fought Hammer before.
Is he always this stubborn?

16:19.179 --> 16:22.613
Yeah. Some guys
just never get the message.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.083
And that's why it feels
so good to take them down.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.756
A Mega-Mandroid.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.691
That's... huge.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.161
Yeah, but there's a bunch
of us and only one of him.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.464
[Justin laughing]

16:39.466 --> 16:42.233
I thought you might come
knocking at my door.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.778
You were saying?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.751
Avengers, Thunderbolts,
give 'em all we've got!

17:02.955 --> 17:04.521
[groaning]
[grunting]

17:10.229 --> 17:12.696
[screaming]

17:12.699 --> 17:14.699
[grunts]

17:24.309 --> 17:25.910
[supersonic scream]

17:30.549 --> 17:31.816
[grunts]

17:38.357 --> 17:39.724
[all groaning]

17:44.563 --> 17:47.298
[supersonic scream]

17:53.739 --> 17:57.275
[supersonic scream]

18:01.847 --> 18:03.915
Songbird, time to fly!

18:03.917 --> 18:06.317
Huh?
[groans]

18:08.954 --> 18:10.555
[supersonic scream]

18:10.557 --> 18:12.290
This isn't working.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.525
We need to come up
with a new strategy.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.864
That force field
is the strongest
we've encountered yet.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.300
Hammer's using my tech,
which means those are

18:22.302 --> 18:24.869
two force field
projection arrays
on the back of that thing.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.304
Then that's where we hit it.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.306
Citizen V, we need you
to keep that thing busy

18:28.308 --> 18:29.874
while they short-out
the force fields.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.378
It was already
part of my plan.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.282
[laughing]

18:38.284 --> 18:39.650
Whoa!

18:42.454 --> 18:46.557
Phony Stark!
Not such a genius now!

18:46.559 --> 18:48.326
Meteorite,
Hawkeye...

18:48.328 --> 18:51.262
we need to hit those domes on
the back of the Mega-Mandroid.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.597
Wh-whoa!

18:52.599 --> 18:55.566
[roars]

18:55.568 --> 18:57.001
[grunts]

18:59.505 --> 19:01.539
[roars]

19:05.310 --> 19:06.577
Now!

19:06.579 --> 19:07.745
[grunts]

19:15.921 --> 19:17.588
Captain,
the shields are down!

19:17.590 --> 19:21.025
Let him have it!

19:22.861 --> 19:24.529
[supersonic scream]

19:34.306 --> 19:38.509
Hulk smashed all ready.
Now it's your turn!

19:38.511 --> 19:39.644
[grunts]

19:39.646 --> 19:40.878
[screaming]

19:40.880 --> 19:43.447
[roars]

19:47.386 --> 19:49.120
[coughing]

19:55.027 --> 19:58.496
I'll make sure Hammer
gets delivered
to the authorities.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.532
I still can't figure out
how Hammer got my tech.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.768
At least we stopped
him before he could
put it to use.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.740
Sorta feels weird.
Saving the day
without anybody

20:09.742 --> 20:12.476
here to take pictures
and tell us how great we are.

20:12.478 --> 20:16.547
Uh, sorta feels,
well, better.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.584
Please don't tell me you're on
the line with your publicist.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.888
<i>Citizen, baby, how are you?</i>

20:23.890 --> 20:26.857
<i>I just got a call about</i>
<i>you guys from the head</i>
<i>of Momentous Films.</i>

20:26.859 --> 20:30.428
<i>They're talking three-picture</i>
<i>deal! And they--</i>
Gabby!

20:30.430 --> 20:31.596
You're fired.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.598
<i>What? We have--</i>

20:33.600 --> 20:36.367
Don't you love
doing that?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.569
Think Tony's realized
they might be okay?

20:38.571 --> 20:42.607
Maybe. I guess we've all
had to prove ourselves
at some time or another.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.376
Nope, not me.
I've always been good.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.677
[laughs]

20:48.447 --> 20:51.616
Thank you for your
confidence in us, Avengers.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.618
Maybe we were trying
too hard to show you up.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.052
No hard feelings.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.556
You can never have enough
friends in this business.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.625
I trust we'll be
seeing each other again.

21:03.462 --> 21:07.698
Excellent. Trust is
exactly what we want.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.407
<i>[Iron Man]</i>
<i>New team of heroes</i>
<i>will always come and go,</i>

21:16.409 --> 21:19.610
<i>but the Avengers--</i>
<i>we're here to stay.</i>

21:19.612 --> 21:22.480
