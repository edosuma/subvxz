00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
Previously on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:03.086 --> 00:05.380
Our names
aren't really Harry and Hermione.

00:05.463 --> 00:06.715
- I'm Griffin.
- Harper.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.799
For real?

00:07.882 --> 00:10.385
What if I put the money into the hotel?
50-50 partner.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.555
You can rest easy now. It's over.
The Tremonts are back on the land.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.479
You see it, right?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.314
It came from the mirror.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.901
Her spirit's freed,
and there aren't any more ghosts.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.413
Sam, your time machine, it works.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.415
He disappeared
during the middle of the night.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.751
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
Sam?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.296
"I've gone on a journey through time.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.923
If I'm not back in three weeks,
destroy the radio."

00:49.007 --> 00:50.008
The future.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.593
I missed you while you were gone.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.303
Like, a lot.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.805
I missed you, too.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.244
So, um…

01:19.037 --> 01:21.539
parents are going all-out
for this opening tonight.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.251
Gift bags. Theme party.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.795
Heard there's even a band.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.713
Yeah, should, uh… should be fun.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.507
Yeah.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.096
I hate this.
We haven't really hung out in weeks.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.306
It's not that I don't want to, it's just…

01:39.516 --> 01:41.559
things have just felt kind of weird.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.283
Maybe they wouldn't be if we talked about
what happened that night.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.940
You mean about how... how we, uh…

01:48.316 --> 01:50.026
- you know, how, um...
- Just say it.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.152
We almost kissed.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.202
Unfortunately, we're all booked.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.930
If you wanna leave
your contact information,

02:00.954 --> 02:02.455
I can add you to the wait list.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.042
Great. Hope to see you soon.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.379
I hear that right? There's a wait list?

02:09.462 --> 02:10.880
Two pages long.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.009
People are lining up to stay here,
and the doors aren't even open.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.345
Guess the price those contractors charged
to finish was worth it.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.223
We are about to make
someone on that list very happy.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.642
Finally found the key to 205.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.394
Kids are cleaning it out now.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.480
Uh, but it has that draft.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.834
And we still haven't figured out
where that's coming from.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.820
Eh, nothing an extra blanket can't fix
in the meantime, right?

02:35.321 --> 02:37.323
Hi, this is Ben Campbell from The Tremont.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.911
As a matter of fact,
a room just became available.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.335
Did you see this website?
It's about the opening.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.919
Have you looked at the comments?

02:50.003 --> 02:54.507
"Always wanted to stay in a haunted hotel.
I can't wait to see a ghost tonight."

02:54.591 --> 02:56.760
The ghost left weeks ago.
We saw it happen.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.846
Which means the opening
is probably gonna be a bust.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.806
Unless…

03:01.890 --> 03:03.099
Where are you going?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.018
To give the people what they want.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.575
All I'm saying is, it's common
for people in stressful situations

03:20.658 --> 03:22.118
to do things they normally wouldn't.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.580
Having to pretend to be someone else
definitely qualifies as stressful.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.292
Daisy did her best, but wearing
your clothes didn't make her you.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.627
I mean, I could always tell.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.878
Always?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.214
- Except for that one time in the bunker.
- Yeah, okay.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.007
Because I was focused on
switching you back

03:36.091 --> 03:37.550
before people got too suspicious.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.219
Sam knew something was off right away.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.263
Would've had to tell him the truth
if I was stuck in the past much longer.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.158
We can't risk
messing with time like that again.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
Too many things could've changed.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.811
And that's not what we want.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.271
Is it?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.107
To change things?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.861
We should, um...

03:56.945 --> 03:58.822
We should get these bags finished.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.031
Right.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.732
Mrs. Barker. Hi.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.068
Harper, from the café.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.113
Is there something we can help you with?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.161
It might be a good idea
to let someone know you're here.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.787
You live at Shady Acres, right?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.458
Oh, uh,
looks like your ride just pulled up.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.711
Don't do it.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.005
- Sorry, what?
- Don't go forward.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.965
It's time to head back now, Mrs. Barker.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.805
Don't go forward?

05:05.889 --> 05:09.601
She's just a confused old woman.
Probably doesn't know what she's saying.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.896
What if she was talking about the future?
Like, don't go forward in time?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.637
- That would mean...
- Mrs. Barker knows about the portal.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.413
Come in.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.498
Hey, Mom.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.292
Lunch is almost ready.
Planning on coming down soon?

05:35.752 --> 05:36.836
I'm not really hungry.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.840
Wherever Sam is, I'm sure he's just fine.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.301
We don't know that. What if he needs help?

05:43.385 --> 05:46.096
Honey, you have such a big heart.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.141
I know you're worried, but it might be
time to accept Sam isn't coming back.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.351
He left weeks ago.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.604
Three weeks ago.
Anything could've happened.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.316
Or it's possible Sam may not want to
be found, and we need to respect that.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.070
I'll see you downstairs.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.330
Don't do this to me, Sam.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.957
Please come back.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.822
Sure this is gonna work?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.783
This is my area of expertise, remember?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.535
Go ahead, try it.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.958
Like I said, instant ghost.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.337
We've seen what a real ghost can do.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.797
- It's way creepier.
- Patience, people.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.050
I'm just getting started.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.892
Something has been drawing Mrs. Barker
to the hotel.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.102
Now she warns us
about going into the future?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.479
It can't be a coincidence.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.814
She never actually said future, you did.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.126
- What else could she have meant?
- Any number of things.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.253
For all we know, Mrs. Barker
was talking to the driver,

07:24.277 --> 07:25.477
telling him not to go forward.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.030
She grabbed my arm, Harper.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.449
Stared me right in the eye.
That warning was for us.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.909
Okay.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.495
Um, excuse me.
We're looking for Mrs. Barker's room.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.205
Visiting hours are over.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.416
- Oh, uh, we won't stay long.
- We just wanted to bring this by for her.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.686
It's souvenirs from The Tremont's
grand opening party tonight.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.712
We know how much
Mrs. Barker likes the hotel.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.757
You can leave it at the front desk.
Down the hall to your right.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.467
Thank you.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.560
Well, that was a bust.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.979
Maybe not.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.944
Mrs. Barker? Remember us?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.154
We saw you at The Tremont earlier.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.531
You gave us a warning.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.117
What'll happen if we do go forward?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.993
Sounded like you've seen it.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.456
Griffin, we need to leave.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.185
Mrs. Barker, if you've been to the future,
you can tell us. We'll believe you.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.919
You're not supposed to be in here.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.879
We were headed to the desk
and saw Mrs. Barker.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.798
Just figured we'd drop this off with her.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.176
Mrs. Barker needs her rest.
I'll show you out.

08:36.141 --> 08:41.187
Harry, Hermione,
it was good to see you again.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.816
Savannah?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.030
Mrs. Barker
comes into the café all the time.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.948
I can't believe I never recognized her.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.827
Why would you?
I mean, Savannah's, like, 70 now.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.704
She's still the same person, Griffin.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.082
Something should've seemed,
I don't know, familiar.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.754
Well, Savannah grew up.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.340
She got married,
and she lived this whole life.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.885
It'd be crazy if she wasn't any different.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.222
I mean, think about how much our parents
changed from when they were kids.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.307
That's true.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.478
Hey. What do you think we'll be like
at their age?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.771
Hmm.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.357
Taller.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.192
At least, I better be.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.614
Would we still recognize each other
if we passed on the street?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.199
Come on.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.992
You know, you're pretty unforgettable,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.162
Locker Ninja.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.045
- We have a problem.
- If it's about the napkins,

09:47.128 --> 09:49.190
- I've already called...
- We have to close the springs.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.800
- I was just down there and they...
- Knock, knock.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.969
Allison! Hi, good to see you again.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.389
Allison is writing an article
for the local paper.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.766
I hope you don't mind the early check-in.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.227
Just wanted to get a little preview
of the springs

10:02.310 --> 10:03.390
before it gets too crowded.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.107
Well, we have just been so focused on
getting the hotel ready,

10:07.190 --> 10:10.193
that our landscaping plan
fell a little behind schedule.

10:11.486 --> 10:15.615
Which is why we will be having you back
for a second complimentary stay

10:15.699 --> 10:17.659
as soon as the springs are open.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.536
Here, let me grab that bag for you.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.663
Oh, don't forget this one.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.249
Just a little something
to help you settle in.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.332
Thank you.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.253
We have a great room for you.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.423
- What happened?
- The springs are a mess.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.050
It smells like the end of
a week-long music festival.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.301
Of course, they do.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.722
Every new business has its little hiccups,
especially during the first week.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.224
Probably won't be
the only thing to go wrong tonight.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.538
- It has to be subtle.
- You're talking to the king of subtle.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.040
Hey, guys.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.336
The king, huh? Okay.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.712
You done with 205?

11:10.795 --> 11:11.796
Yep. All clean.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.089
Except for the floor.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.550
Yeah, I can't figure out what this is.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.677
Wouldn't have anything to do with

11:17.761 --> 11:19.929
whatever's hiding
behind your back, would it?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.309
We were making slime to scare the guests.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.394
You really need to learn
when to stop talking.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.758
We have a lot riding on tonight.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.231
It needs to go off without a hitch,
which means no...

11:34.319 --> 11:35.319
Pranks.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.823
That was set up way before the slime.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.118
Downstairs. Now.

11:58.301 --> 12:03.682
When I was a little girl, The Tremont
meant summer camp and brunch on Sundays.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.643
Back then,
I never would've guessed that one day

12:06.726 --> 12:08.603
I would have my own restaurant here.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.690
Or that my children would be
so deeply connected

12:11.773 --> 12:14.275
to the history of this hotel
and this land.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.114
The Tremont now represents
a rebirth for me,

12:19.197 --> 12:21.324
for the next generation
of the Tremont family,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.244
and for our dear friends,
the Campbells, as well.

12:24.828 --> 12:28.248
Restoring the hotel started
as my husband's project,

12:28.331 --> 12:32.669
his passion,
but soon became our family's lifeline.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.588
Uh, this process nearly broke us at times,

12:35.672 --> 12:38.883
but, uh, it also built us back up again.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.846
We made so many special memories here.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.142
We hope you will too,
for generations to come.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.189
It's our pleasure to finally say…

12:53.273 --> 12:55.650
Welcome to The Tremont!

13:11.833 --> 13:15.754
Did you hear that strange
scraping noise last night?

13:15.837 --> 13:17.881
It was coming from across the hall.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.342
Room 205, I think.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.093
Strange scraping noise?

13:22.177 --> 13:23.678
That's good. Keep it up.

13:23.762 --> 13:27.807
It sounded like someone,
or something, was trying to get out.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.642
Keep what up?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.978
And why are you shouting?
I'm standing right here.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.982
What part of "we need to convince people
that this place is haunted"

13:36.066 --> 13:37.650
do you not understand?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.069
Dad said no more pranks.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.904
Rumors weren't taken off the table.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.367
Is that Savannah?

13:46.034 --> 13:49.162
Oh, my gosh! It is her! Look!

13:49.245 --> 13:50.538
Over there.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.042
Oh, my gosh.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.669
It is her.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.301
I take back everything I said.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.636
That was incredible.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.054
How'd you pull it off?

14:06.137 --> 14:08.139
You'll have to be more specific.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.934
- Savannah walking through the lobby.
- Had to be a look-alike.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.560
Or maybe a hologram.

14:12.644 --> 14:15.230
I'm good, but not that good.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.650
So you didn't set anything up?

14:18.733 --> 14:21.528
My mom already grounded me for a week.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.987
Not looking to do hard time.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.740
It really was a ghost.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.283
Come on.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.768
Why would Savannah risk coming up here?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.919
She wouldn't. Unless something happened.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.965
Split up.
The sooner we find her, the better.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.233
Help! Is anyone there?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.777
Please, don't leave me!

15:07.866 --> 15:10.201
Savannah's not down here.
Let's check upstairs.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.247
Harper, do you see her?

15:15.832 --> 15:16.875
I saw you…

15:17.959 --> 15:18.960
trapped in a fire.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.383
I'm still not sure how it actually works.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.344
I mean,
maybe the vision doesn't mean anything.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.055
- I've been wrong before.
- I'm not waiting around to find out.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.099
There must be a reason Savannah
warned us not to go into the future.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.343
Not asking you to go with me.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.395
Don't you know me better than that by now?
If you go, I go.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.356
Savannah!

15:39.439 --> 15:40.565
Thank goodness.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.987
Are you crazy? What are you doing up here?

15:46.071 --> 15:48.031
Sam went into the future
and hasn't come back yet.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.449
The future?

15:49.532 --> 15:50.617
2024.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.911
He left me a note telling me
to destroy the radio

15:52.994 --> 15:55.455
if he wasn't back in three weeks.
That's tonight.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.539
What's in 2024?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.084
Sam was hoping to find a cure for his mom.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.503
But if I break the radio,
he won't be able to save her.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.629
So, what do I do?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.214
Go home.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.008
- But Sam...
- The crystal's cracking, Savannah.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.028
It gets worse each time you go through.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.930
If you don't go home now,
you might not get another chance.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.682
You've already risked too much.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.397
I just can't believe
I won't see you guys again.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.437
I have a feeling, someday you will.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.650
Here, take this.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.653
No one else can know you're here.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.416
Oh, uh, Harper?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.668
This is Allison Carter.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.431
She's doing a story
on the hotel's history,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.547
- and she had some questions for you.
- Okay.

16:46.256 --> 16:49.342
Your mother was just telling me
about the document you found

16:49.426 --> 16:50.427
in the city's archives.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.095
I'd love to hear more about it.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.972
Would now be an okay time?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.140
Of course.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.310
So, first,
I just wanna hear a little bit more…

16:59.978 --> 17:02.647
So, what would you do
if you came face-to-face with Savannah?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.816
Well, I'd ask her to dance.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.861
- Stay out of sight. I'll distract them.
- Yeah.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.905
Hey! So, you guys...
You guys enjoying the party?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.411
Whoa! You all right?

17:17.495 --> 17:19.706
You may wanna slow down.
It's pretty crowded tonight.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.584
No kidding.
Never know who you'll run into.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.344
Okay, last question.

17:32.427 --> 17:37.515
What does it mean to you, as a Tremont,
to have this property back in the family?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.768
In a word,

17:40.894 --> 17:41.936
everything.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.315
All right. Thank you.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.401
Oh, excuse me. Uh… hey. Uh… hey.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.111
What's going on?

17:50.195 --> 17:51.196
Huh? What do you mean?

17:51.279 --> 17:52.614
Well, you look worried.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.159
Wouldn't have anything to do
with Griffin and that girl, would it?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.954
That is not a little hiccup.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.176
Where's Griffin?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.738
He's keeping Topher and the twins busy,
so I could get down here.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.555
I just saw them. Griffin wasn't up there.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.474
Maybe he's already in the bunker?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.142
Let's find out.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.747
Look at all this water.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.124
Where is Zoey with that key?

18:44.207 --> 18:45.583
We need more towels!

18:47.293 --> 18:48.294
Here you go.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.089
- Are those my sheets?
- It's all we could find.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.884
Water just keeps coming.
A pipe must've burst.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.511
More like the sewer line.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.096
Smells like the springs up here.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.890
Well, we can't close the hotel.
That would be a disaster.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.225
What is this considered?

19:03.727 --> 19:06.813
Got the key! Dad's looking for a wrench
to turn off the water main.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.944
It's like something's wedged
against the door.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.362
Make room for the muscle.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.868
- And change of plans.
- Did that just...

19:19.951 --> 19:22.162
Move!

20:32.774 --> 20:33.817
2024?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.984
That's where Sam is.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.279
You think Griffin went to warn him
about the crystal? And bring Sam back?

20:40.073 --> 20:41.658
They aren't coming back.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.210
Dad! Mom!

20:52.293 --> 20:53.628
Whoa.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.755
No!
My family could be in there.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.508
Let go! Wyatt! Zoey!

20:58.591 --> 21:00.927
It's empty. Has been for a while.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.390
- A while?
- Yeah.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.725
You're sure?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.560
Except Room 205.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.938
Something evil took hold up there
and wouldn't leave.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.732
It has no choice now.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.821
Sam got the crystal from the springs.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.590
We'll find another one,
and then I can go home.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.533
- Savannah...
- No!

21:23.616 --> 21:25.452
We have to find a way to fix this.

21:26.411 --> 21:31.374
I can't stay here. I have a family now.
I have a family.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.172
Harper?

21:38.923 --> 21:40.342
Mr. Campbell.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.222
What is this place?
