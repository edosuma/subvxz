♪♪

00:33.967 --> 00:37.238
Friends, family,
we are gathered here today

00:37.271 --> 00:41.275
to celebrate the union
between Emily and Murph.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.777
Sure we won't have
any interruptions?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.446
Don't worry.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.115
(whispers)
I took care of Adam.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.117
(muffled grunting)

00:49.150 --> 00:53.287
And is my distinct honor
to unite Emily and Murph

00:53.321 --> 00:55.889
in the most holy of tradition.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.024
(spits)
I object.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.058
(crowd gasping)

00:58.092 --> 00:59.427
(Adam spits)

00:59.460 --> 01:01.462
Nearly all wedding traditions
are nothing but pointless

01:01.495 --> 01:03.030
and expensive displays
of wealth.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.633
Adam, we don't have time
for this.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.600
Um, actually, we do.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.469
I budgeted it
into the schedule.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.371
Great.
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.573
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:12.606 --> 01:15.509
♪♪

01:22.283 --> 01:24.118
No, not this time, okay?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.986
My engagement was
one thing,

01:26.019 --> 01:28.822
but I've been dreaming
about this day my whole life.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.391
My friends are here.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.160
My very traditional family
is here.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.162
You're making us
proud, son.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.497
Of course, we would've
preferred a Catholic
priest, but...

01:36.530 --> 01:37.965
This is tradition, Adam.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.434
The dress, the ceremony,
the cake.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.902
It all symbolizes true love.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.839
Nope, those traditions
represent one thing-- money.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.276
In fact, this entire ceremony
has been hijacked

01:48.309 --> 01:50.311
by a greedy industry
looking to make a buck.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.479
(cash register ringing)

01:51.512 --> 01:53.347
But this is the way
weddings have always been!

01:53.381 --> 01:54.682
Wrong again.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.185
American weddings were once
informal affairs,

01:57.218 --> 01:59.353
held in homes
or at community events

01:59.387 --> 02:02.190
like barn raisings
or corn-husking bees.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.092
I hereby pronounce you
man and wife.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.627
You may now eat the corn.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.030
(whirring effect)

02:10.063 --> 02:13.267
Uh, nice try, Adam, but...
that's not a real wedding.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.868
She's not even
wearing white.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.470
That means
she's not a virgin.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.005
Ow.
No, you lout.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.840
It means I'm not rich.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.843
Back then, white fabric was
almost impossible to clean,

02:22.876 --> 02:25.679
so a white dress was only
meant to be worn once.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.381
Poor folks can't afford that.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.550
We got to make
our dresses last.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.452
Brown don't show the dirt.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.822
It wasn't till I,
Queen Victoria,

02:34.855 --> 02:37.157
wore a white dress
to my wedding

02:37.191 --> 02:40.027
that other brides began to copy
me to show off their wealth.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.397
But even then, it was strictly
for the well-to-do.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.567
Thinks she's so good
in her more-than-one dress.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.502
(coughing)

02:48.536 --> 02:50.738
And her more-than-one lung.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.574
Even white wedding cakes
were all about braggin'.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.843
White sugar back then
was so expensive,

02:55.876 --> 02:57.745
it was basically
edible bling.

02:57.778 --> 03:01.715
Oh, my cake is as white
as all my friends.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.417
Well, Emily's wearing
a white dress

03:03.451 --> 03:04.752
and we're not rich.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.687
Nope, but you're making it
rain like you are.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.922
And all because
of bridal magazines.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.759
Meet Vicki Howard, she's the
author of "Brides Incorporated"

03:11.792 --> 03:13.594
and an expert in wedding
commercialization.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.429
Weddings used to be
simple affairs.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.531
But then bridal magazines
encouraged brides

03:17.565 --> 03:19.099
to marry like the wealthy

03:19.132 --> 03:21.101
and created a wedding industry
of unrelated products

03:21.134 --> 03:23.771
like silverware,
gifts for the home,

03:23.804 --> 03:25.273
and even early wedding gowns.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.440
And they did all this

03:26.474 --> 03:28.342
when Americans were
at their poorest.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.210
It was the birth
of an entire industry.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.813
And now the cost of weddings
keeps skyrocketing.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.183
Give me that.
Listen...

03:36.216 --> 03:38.118
people want the finest
on their big day.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.353
And that comes at a price.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.554
It's not like
we're cheating people.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.123
Oh, no, it's exactly
what you're doing.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.260
The wedding industry
systematically overcharges
young couples

03:46.294 --> 03:47.795
just because they can.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.130
One study found that a majority
of flower shops,

03:50.163 --> 03:52.132
photographers,
ooh, and cake shops...

03:52.165 --> 03:53.401
No way, Jose!

03:53.434 --> 03:54.935
...charged more for a wedding
than they did

03:54.968 --> 03:57.137
for a birthday party
of the same size.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.472
It's called the wedding tags.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.574
Basically, anything
Ashley here booked for you

04:00.608 --> 04:02.142
is a rip-off.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.212
Um, I have to go,
uh, count mason jars

04:05.245 --> 04:07.214
or something like that.
Mm-hmm.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.082
That's insane.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.618
How can they get away
with this?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.820
Well, this culture's spending
is now so pervasive,

04:12.853 --> 04:15.155
if you don't do it,
your family will be pissed.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.224
Murph, where are
the floral centerpieces?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.560
You can't have a wedding
with floral centerpieces.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.161
Mom, they were
two grand extra.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.297
You're breaking
your mother's heart.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.466
Tell Ashley to put it
on the Discover.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.800
(cash register rings)

04:26.834 --> 04:28.669
Well, maybe going through
this whole expensive ordeal

04:28.702 --> 04:31.505
together will make us
stronger as a couple.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.674
Ooh, sorry, babe.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.776
Researchers
at Emory University

04:35.809 --> 04:37.611
found that the more
you spend on your wedding,

04:37.645 --> 04:40.013
you're actually more likely
to end in divorce.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.515
How do you know that?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.950
This...

04:42.983 --> 04:44.618
was my bachelorette party.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.786
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.421
But he has a point.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.657
I mean, no one we paid
to help plan this wedding

04:49.690 --> 04:52.259
gives two craps if we stay
together or not.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.794
That is not true.

04:53.827 --> 04:57.631
I care very deeply about...
Emily and Smurf.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.033
The Discover card
was declined.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.369
Should I use the Amex?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.940
Remain calm, Murph.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.776
It's your special day.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.444
It's your
special day!

05:10.478 --> 05:12.646
Don't go nuts at your own
wedding, even though...

05:12.680 --> 05:14.648
Is he okay?
Oh, yeah.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.550
That's just
his thinking walk.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.152
No, not today, Conover!

05:19.186 --> 05:20.654
Because, guess what,
buddy?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.657
I just figured out
your little lesson.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.859
Oh, well, tell me.
I love to learn.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.063
(clears throat)

05:30.097 --> 05:32.232
A century of advertising has
distracted us

05:32.265 --> 05:33.967
from what's really important.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.836
It's not about the money
or the gifts

05:35.869 --> 05:38.906
or the thread count
of the table runners.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.073
It's about love.

05:40.107 --> 05:43.511
All this, it's just about
you and me

05:43.544 --> 05:47.080
declaring our eternal,
undying love for each other.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.349
That's what weddings used
to be about.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.853
And that's what I want
our wedding to be about, too.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.589
Because I love you, Emily,
and I always will.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.990
(crowd)
Aww...

05:57.024 --> 05:59.427
Ah, babe.
I love you, too.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.995
So, Adam, you want
to take back that objection?

06:02.029 --> 06:05.265
Oh... gosh,
I wish I could,

06:05.298 --> 06:08.436
but science says your feelings
are almost certain to change.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.503
Want me to tell you
about it?

06:09.537 --> 06:12.906
Oh, please do!
Please do!

06:12.940 --> 06:14.942
All right, people,
this is gonna be a while.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.777
So let's just start
the dinner course

06:16.810 --> 06:19.680
and we will finish the ceremony
later, okay? Thanks.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.281
(Murph screaming)

06:24.585 --> 06:26.286
(cork pops, glasses clink)

06:27.655 --> 06:29.122
(crowd chatter)

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
(glass clinking)

06:30.624 --> 06:32.893
Murph, you're the perfect son.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.396
And Emily, you're the perfect
daughter-in-law.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.932
Your love's gonna last forever.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.801
And it better.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.969
(lowers voice)
Or else.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.937
Cheers.

06:43.971 --> 06:47.107
(cheering and applause)

06:47.140 --> 06:49.309
Ugh, that is a lot
of pressure.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.144
Isn't it weird that our culture
is so obsessed

06:51.178 --> 06:52.312
with eternal love?
(chuckles)

06:52.345 --> 06:53.814
Can I borrow Emily?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.649
The photographer needs
200 more shots of her

06:55.683 --> 06:56.784
holding a rose.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.619
Thank God.
Okay, have fun.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.888
(whispers)
Go, go, go.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.224
No, Adam, you can't ruin love.
Are you kidding?!

07:04.257 --> 07:07.294
That's like ruining,
I don't know, love.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.497
It's the most important
thing in life.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.932
Right, in America,
we basically worship

07:11.965 --> 07:14.234
the concept
of romantic love.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.804
In the name of the Meg,
the Ryan,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.739
the Billy and the Crystal,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.742
I'll have
what she's having.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.911
(all)
Amen.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.914
We make movies about it,
we write poems to it.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.017
Heck, "love" is the most
popular word in song titles.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.252
What, more than
"the" or "and"?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.521
We're not counting
function words.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.122
Don't be such an Adam.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.290
But the fact is,
for most of human history,

07:37.324 --> 07:39.527
love was considered
a temporary emotion

07:39.560 --> 07:41.461
that had nothing
to do with marriage.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.463
In fact, loving your spouse
was once considered

07:43.497 --> 07:44.865
weird and irresponsible.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.100
In the second century,
a Roman politician

07:47.134 --> 07:50.170
was expelled from the Senate
for kissing his wife in public.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.140
He loves his wife?
How uncouth.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.643
Now, who's down for an orgy?
Ha-ha.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.844
(Adam)
And in the 12th century,

07:56.877 --> 07:58.311
a famous treatise declared...

07:58.345 --> 08:01.448
"Love can have no place
between husband and wife."

08:01.481 --> 08:03.717
(Adam)
And let's not forget
Benjamin Franklin, who said...

08:08.822 --> 08:11.324
Wow, Ben Franklin
at my wedding.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.861
Sir, is there anything else
you can tell me

08:13.894 --> 08:15.729
about your incredible life?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.330
Well, over
a dozen skeletons

08:17.364 --> 08:19.299
were recently discovered
in my basement.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.970
And no one knows why
they're there.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.572
We got a wedding crasher.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.207
Yeah.
All right, old timer.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.542
Let's move it along.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.911
Wait, so what did they think
that, uh, love was for?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.245
(glass clinking)

08:32.279 --> 08:34.748
Love was a very frivolous,
irresponsible distraction

08:34.782 --> 08:36.416
from the real business
of marriage.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.918
Meet Stephanie Coontz.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.087
She's an historian and professor
at Evergreen State College

08:40.120 --> 08:42.556
and she literally wrote the book
on the subject.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.057
(Stephanie)
For thousands of years,

08:44.091 --> 08:47.094
marriage was about making
economic and political deals,

08:47.127 --> 08:48.596
military treaties,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.263
expanding the family
labor force.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.265
And it was considered
absolutely weird

08:52.299 --> 08:54.768
to do such important business
for love.

08:54.802 --> 08:58.538
But about 200 years ago,
some people began to insist

08:58.572 --> 09:00.741
that we should let young people
make their own decisions

09:00.774 --> 09:03.276
and we should let them
make them on the basis of love.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.913
That sounds... better.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.049
Sure, but our modern concept
of love is just as weird.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.885
In many ways, we take it
way too seriously.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.688
Beginning with the poet
Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
who declared...

09:14.722 --> 09:19.192
To be happy in married life,
you must have a soul mate.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.961
He coined the term
"soul mate"?

09:20.994 --> 09:24.965
You could say I created
two symbolic albatrosses.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.300
"Rime of the Ancient Mariner"?

09:27.334 --> 09:28.969
Nobody?
Oh...

09:29.002 --> 09:30.804
And we ran with
that chizz.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.406
Today, our dominant cultural
narrative of love

09:33.440 --> 09:34.808
is that somewhere out there,

09:34.842 --> 09:37.044
everyone has a missing
other half,

09:37.077 --> 09:39.279
a single perfect
counterpart,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.148
the mythical one.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.415
He's the one.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.917
(woman)
She's the one, isn't she?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.585
They both knew
they had found the one.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.654
She's the one.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.821
The right one.
The right one.

09:47.855 --> 09:48.822
The one...
The one...

09:48.856 --> 09:49.890
He's the one.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.058
Okay, that one's
from "The Matrix."

09:51.091 --> 09:52.826
Man, that movie
is still cool.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.829
Anyway, this whole idea is
complete nonsense.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.497
Just because
it's in movies

09:57.530 --> 09:59.733
doesn't mean
it's nonsense, okay?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.935
The first time
I saw Emily,

10:01.969 --> 10:03.503
I knew soul mates
were real.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.505
Wow, well, isn't it lucky
that your soul mate

10:05.538 --> 10:07.507
happened to live
20 minutes away rather than,

10:07.540 --> 10:09.009
I don't know,
Moldova.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.510
No.
Okay.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.980
Let's do the math.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.082
About half the world's
population is female,

10:15.115 --> 10:16.483
so, for you,

10:16.516 --> 10:20.921
there are roughly 3.5 billion
potential soul mates

10:20.954 --> 10:22.522
alive on Earth today.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.357
Now, according to you,
soul mates are detected

10:24.391 --> 10:26.026
via eye contact, yes?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.028
So let's assume you make
eye contact with, uh,

10:28.061 --> 10:29.663
a dozen new people every day.

10:29.697 --> 10:32.299
Multiply that
by 365 days a year,

10:32.332 --> 10:35.335
and it will take
800,000 years

10:35.368 --> 10:37.204
for you to find
your soul mate.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.874
You'll only meet her in one
out of every 10,000 lifetimes.

10:40.908 --> 10:44.044
God, you are like the most
depressing accountant.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.813
It-- it's--
it's not literal.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.047
It's a metaphor.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.216
Well, it's a metaphor that's
hurting your relationship.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.985
One study found that couples
that believe in "destiny"

10:52.019 --> 10:54.021
and "soul mates"
break up sooner

10:54.054 --> 10:55.522
than those that believe
that relationships

10:55.555 --> 10:57.290
need to grow and change.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.492
I don't care.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.295
I know Emily and I
are soul mates.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.064
Because, when I see her...

11:04.097 --> 11:06.066
I get butterflies
in my stomach.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.335
I can't help but feel giddy.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.070
I'm infatuated
by just the idea of her.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.472
Oh, that feeling you're
describing is actually

11:12.505 --> 11:14.074
a phenomenon
called limerence.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.009
God!

11:16.043 --> 11:18.645
Oh, what, like a dirty
Irish poem?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.647
No, limerence.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.651
It's a term that means intense,
involuntary infatuated love.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.187
Well, that's the way
I'll feel about Emily forever.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.489
No, you probably won't.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.391
Because researchers say
that limerence lasts,

11:31.424 --> 11:34.594
on average, just 18 months
to three years.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.830
Oh, wait, you and Emily
have been dating

11:36.864 --> 11:38.098
about three years, right?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.100
You're just jealous!

11:40.133 --> 11:42.870
Murph, you and Emily
are amazing.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.238
But the biggest mistake
our culture makes about love

11:45.272 --> 11:49.276
is when we connect a temporary
feeling to a permanent union.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.578
The strongest relationships
are between two people

11:51.611 --> 11:54.214
who understand that love,
like all emotions,

11:54.247 --> 11:58.451
can grow and change
and sometimes even fade.

11:58.485 --> 12:04.758
♪♪

12:04.792 --> 12:06.359
But I don't want it
to fade.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.729
It might not, but it's important
to accept that it could.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.631
Thinking that all love
is eternal

12:11.664 --> 12:14.902
and butterflies are forever
is straight-up fantasy.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.871
Realistic marriages
can and do last.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.539
You just got to prepare
for what's gonna happen

12:19.572 --> 12:21.741
when the butterflies
fly away.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.276
(belching)

12:23.310 --> 12:24.978
No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:25.012 --> 12:26.814
Come back,
you stupid butterflies.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.082
Emily and I have
something special!

12:29.116 --> 12:30.283
Murph?

12:30.317 --> 12:32.485
Come over here.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.621
Hey,
it's okay

12:34.654 --> 12:37.057
if we're not head-over-heels
our whole lives.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.293
Our relationships foundation
is so much stronger

12:40.327 --> 12:42.229
than something created
by leprechauns.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.763
Not limericks,
limerence...

12:43.797 --> 12:47.267
I know, but what if
we get a di...?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.468
I can't even say it.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.003
What?
Divorce?

12:50.037 --> 12:51.939
Don't say that
at a wedding!

12:51.972 --> 12:53.907
Why not?
Divorce, divorce, divorce.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.642
Frankly, we should all be
saying it more

12:55.675 --> 12:58.311
because the truth is,
divorce is good.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.512
(crowd gasps, glass shatters)

13:01.381 --> 13:03.516
'Kay, I'm gonna
start the DJ

13:03.550 --> 13:06.119
before everyone kills
your friend here.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.190
(music playing inside)

13:10.223 --> 13:12.525
It's all about
the Benjamins, baby.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.760
Let's go!

13:13.793 --> 13:15.963
(crowd cheering)
Whoo!

13:15.996 --> 13:18.498
You know, for a weirdo
from the 18th century,

13:18.531 --> 13:20.167
he's got pretty good taste.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.869
(music continues)

13:21.902 --> 13:23.803
(toilet flushing)
Adam, stop saying "divorce."

13:23.837 --> 13:25.205
Why?
I don't know.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.539
It's bad luck.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.208
If you say it three times,
the divorce horse appears

13:28.241 --> 13:29.376
and rides away
with your wife.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.544
Divorce, divorce, divorce.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.714
(laughs, snorts)
Who gets the kids?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.483
Come on.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.987
Our culture's fear of divorce
is totally ridiculous.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.389
Oh, hey, a photo booth,
ha-ha.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.025
Politicians and the media
constantly talk

13:45.058 --> 13:46.994
as though divorce's
mere existence

13:47.027 --> 13:48.828
were a threat to society.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.899
The number-one country
in the world in talking
about family values

13:51.932 --> 13:53.833
is number one in divorce...

13:53.867 --> 13:57.304
The social problems from divorce
are worse than ever.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.972
The massive amounts
of divorce...

13:59.006 --> 14:00.507
Our society is breaking down

14:00.540 --> 14:02.409
and our families are
falling apart.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.776
(camera shutter clicks)

14:05.212 --> 14:07.514
Oh, God, society is
gonna crumble.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.748
People will eat each other.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.417
We're gonna have to celebrate
two Christmases.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.751
Murph, calm down.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.253
Divorce isn't scary.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.755
In fact,
it's a good thing.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.991
Are you serious, dude?!

14:18.025 --> 14:19.993
Half of all marriages
end in divorce.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.494
Oh, yeah, that's what
everyone says.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.729
But it's not actually true.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.764
(crowd cheering)
Oh, hey, a dance circle.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.266
(chuckles)

14:26.299 --> 14:28.035
♪♪

14:28.068 --> 14:30.603
Properly calculated,
divorce rates in the U.S.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.605
have never exceeded 41%.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.275
And after peaking in the late
'70s and early '80s,

14:35.308 --> 14:38.946
since then, the divorce rate
has actually gone down.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.781
(crowd cheering, music stops)

14:41.814 --> 14:44.351
So what?
Divorce is still awful.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.919
Why do you think that?

14:45.953 --> 14:48.088
Because it means a happy
marriage is over.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.723
No, it means
a bad marriage is over.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.393
And before access to divorce
improved in the '70s,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.296
people were trapped
in those awful relationships.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.697
(Adam)
In the old days,
to get a divorce,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.632
you often needed
both spouses present.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.734
My husband is trying
to kill me.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.636
And where is this husband?

15:03.670 --> 15:04.871
Knife shopping.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.573
No dice!

15:06.606 --> 15:08.141
(Adam)
You also needed
to establish fault,

15:08.175 --> 15:10.310
so if you wanted a boring old
amicable divorce,

15:10.343 --> 15:11.945
you were forced
to lie to a judge.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.081
Who was cruel
or inhumane to whom?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.250
Damn.
It-- it was me.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.586
I, uh, attacked him
with scissors?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.221
Ah, yes, dice.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.323
Divorce horse,
do your thing.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.259
(neighing)
Let's go!

15:26.293 --> 15:27.494
(neighing)

15:27.527 --> 15:29.162
And this was particularly
bad for women

15:29.196 --> 15:31.264
because, in many states,
domestic violence

15:31.298 --> 15:33.166
wasn't considered
grounds for divorce.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.169
So they could become trapped
in abusive marriages.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.771
(Adam)
But all that changed in 1969

15:38.805 --> 15:40.340
thanks to Ronald Reagan.

15:40.373 --> 15:44.177
As governor of California,
I introduced no-fault divorce,

15:44.211 --> 15:47.914
a revolutionary innovation
that made it far easier

15:47.947 --> 15:50.183
for folks to separate.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.254
Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this marriage!

15:54.287 --> 15:55.755
(chuckling)

15:55.788 --> 15:57.624
The concept soon spread
to other states

15:57.657 --> 15:58.958
and by some estimates,

15:58.992 --> 16:03.296
reduced cases of female
suicide by 20%.
Wow.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.365
That's why divorce rates
rose in the '70s.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.100
Not because society
was crumbling,

16:07.134 --> 16:09.202
but because divorce
was finally available

16:09.236 --> 16:10.937
to the people
who really needed it.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.139
Whoo-hoo!

16:12.172 --> 16:13.873
Okay, but what about kids?

16:13.906 --> 16:16.476
Kids!
Divorce is bad for kids.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.777
Yeah, it can be tough
on them.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.379
But you know what's also
tough on kids?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.048
Unhappy homes.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.151
Look here, idiot, research says
that kids tend to do worse

16:24.184 --> 16:26.653
when surrounded by constant
parental conflict!

16:26.686 --> 16:28.888
You don't even know that in
many high-discord families,

16:28.921 --> 16:31.524
kids experience relief
after separation!

16:31.558 --> 16:34.394
Oh, wait, then we should
do that then.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.629
I'll get started
on the paperwork.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.398
Well, bye.
(chuckling)

16:38.431 --> 16:40.033
Bye.
Good luck or whatever.

16:40.067 --> 16:43.070
For some couples, divorce
is the right choice.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.737
And to them,
it represents freedom.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.906
It's a critical,
social right.

16:46.939 --> 16:50.143
But if my marriage fails,
then I'm a failure.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.645
Marriages that last
a lifetime are awesome.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.582
But marriages that last
a decade or five years

16:55.615 --> 16:58.585
or even just a few months,
those can be wonderful

16:58.618 --> 17:00.087
and they have value, too.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.322
We shouldn't
stigmatize them.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.990
Remember limerence?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.094
Feelings do change,
and, hey,

17:07.127 --> 17:10.597
hopefully your marriage will
last a long, long time.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.600
But if it doesn't,
well, there's good news.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.435
Divorce is there for you.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.605
No, no!
What the finch, man!

17:18.638 --> 17:20.873
You can't just tell me
that I'll stop loving Emily

17:20.907 --> 17:22.442
or that I might get a divorce!

17:22.475 --> 17:24.444
You think I don't know
those things?!

17:24.477 --> 17:26.513
And they're just terrifying
to think about!

17:26.546 --> 17:29.749
This isn't what today
was supposed to be like.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.883
Ahh!

17:33.320 --> 17:34.954
Adam, what did you do?

17:34.987 --> 17:37.457
Sorry, I guess the payload
on the truth bomb

17:37.490 --> 17:39.025
was a little bigger
than I expected.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.194
Yeah, okay,
well, step aside.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.296
I know what he needs
to hear.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.564
Hold it!

17:44.597 --> 17:45.965
I don't have
a heartwarming takeaway

17:45.998 --> 17:47.467
until after
the first dance.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.469
So we're gonna go
to break.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
Woman, you are strict.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.477
How's he doing
in there?

17:58.945 --> 18:01.614
Oh, Jeez.
Murph, hon?

18:01.648 --> 18:02.915
It's okay.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.784
No, it's not okay.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.255
Because I spent months planning
to make this day perfect.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.924
And instead, true love is a lie,
the ceremony is a scam,

18:11.958 --> 18:13.260
and we're all headed
for divorce.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.929
Babe, I don't really care
about any of this.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.299
I mean, I only did
the ceremony and the dress

18:19.332 --> 18:20.833
and the farm-to-table
hors d'oeuvres

18:20.867 --> 18:22.669
because it was
important to you.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.338
But honestly, none of this
really matters to me.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.607
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.144
Murph, you know, I honestly
never really thought

18:31.178 --> 18:33.513
I was going to get married.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.848
The idea of being tied to one
person for the rest of your life

18:35.882 --> 18:37.817
kind of contradicts
my rad-as-hell,

18:37.850 --> 18:40.687
independent woman
life narrative.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.855
But then I met you.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.791
And that's what you wanted.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.026
And... I love you.

18:47.059 --> 18:51.364
So I decided...
why not?

18:51.398 --> 18:53.166
Marriage is just a word.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.836
You know, and one word isn't
gonna change our relationship.

18:56.869 --> 19:00.607
At least I hope it doesn't.
I love our relationship.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.843
And no word is worth putting
this much pressure on yourself.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.219
Murph, this is
a beautiful wedding.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.054
But the pressure that we put
on this single event

19:15.087 --> 19:16.556
is insane.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.058
You're asking yourself to feel
the same way about a person

19:19.091 --> 19:20.560
for the rest of your life.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.829
You're throwing a huge,
expensive party

19:22.862 --> 19:23.963
for all your friends,

19:23.996 --> 19:25.732
and it's a weird
contract signing

19:25.765 --> 19:27.900
where you're promising
to file joint tax returns.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.402
I mean, I know it's tradition,

19:29.436 --> 19:31.904
but it's a tradition that's
gotten a little out of hand.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.540
He's right.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.476
This isn't important.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.312
This...
is what's important.

19:39.346 --> 19:43.516
And no matter what happens,
we'll be okay.

19:43.550 --> 19:47.787
Right now I'm just so happy
that I found someone I love.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.926
Oh, you two were made
for each other.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.596
Objection rescinded.
You have my blessing.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.266
Yeah, no thanks.
We don't need it.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.869
I, Emily,
take thee, Murph,

20:02.902 --> 20:04.904
for better or worse.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.374
You know,
within reason.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.042
Till, let's say,
2025.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.512
I mean, probably longer,
but we'll talk about it

20:12.545 --> 20:14.414
when we get there.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.617
And I, Murph,
take thee, Emily

20:17.650 --> 20:19.619
and I can't predict
the future,

20:19.652 --> 20:22.121
but right now I love you
so much that I could cry.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.791
Which I'm currently doing.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.860
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.030
You may now kiss, come on,
for like the millionth time.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.532
'Cause it's not
the Victorian era.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
We know you've kissed before.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.902
Huh?
(cheering and applause)

20:35.935 --> 20:40.072
Oh, I always cry at verbal
contract agreements.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.647
Just doing a little
drizzle-down cake-onomics.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.282
Drizzle-down cake-onomics?

20:49.316 --> 20:51.150
Oh, yes,
it's very simple.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.652
You just drizzle
a little chocolate

20:52.685 --> 20:55.154
on the tippity toppity,
and eventually

20:55.187 --> 20:57.324
all the pieces get
a little bit.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.826
Looks like it's all pooling
at the top there.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.227
No, no, no, no, no.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.795
It'll get to the bottom.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.765
Just give it
a couple decades.
