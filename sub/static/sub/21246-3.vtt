LAURENCE: <i>This is Vincent Bourg.</i>

00:03.481 --> 00:06.721
<i>Baptiste picked him out
from a list of sex offenders in the district.</i>

00:07.761 --> 00:09.361
You thought I would tell on you?

00:09.521 --> 00:14.441
As of this moment,
our association is to be terminated.

00:15.441 --> 00:18.441
<i>As far as you're concerned,
we never even met.</i>

00:18.641 --> 00:21.321
Olly! Olly!

What are you looking at?

00:24.761 --> 00:26.761
Trouble for Tony Hughes.

Have you seen it?

02:13.921 --> 02:16.481
Cos he'll want it when he comes back.

02:18.481 --> 02:21.721
- (Knock at door)
- Mr Hughes? It's Julien Baptiste.

02:21.881 --> 02:24.841
OK, coming. Just one minute.

02:31.961 --> 02:34.961
- What is it?
- We need you to come to the station with us.

02:35.121 --> 02:36.841
We need to ask you some questions.

02:38.721 --> 02:42.321
- What questions?
- Please come with us to the Commissariat now.

02:42.801 --> 02:45.361
Why? Why do you need to talk to us?

02:45.761 --> 02:48.801
It's just your husband
we wish to speak with for now, Mrs Hughes.

02:49.361 --> 02:51.361
It's better that you stay here.

02:52.521 --> 02:54.521
<i>OK.</i>

02:54.721 --> 02:55.921
I'll put my shoes on.

02:56.081 --> 02:57.801
I should come.

I'll be back soon, OK?

- I am on time.

04:47.481 --> 04:49.481
Exactly. You're usually early.

05:02.281 --> 05:04.281
- (Speaks French)
- Yes, thank you.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.801
I have found you a corner of the office.

05:07.081 --> 05:09.081
Follow me.

05:13.921 --> 05:17.001
(Greetings in French)

05:18.521 --> 05:21.361
- If you need anything, come to me.
- What about the basement?

05:21.521 --> 05:24.041
A forensics squad is already there,
working on the room.

05:24.201 --> 05:25.561
<i>Oh.</i>

05:25.961 --> 05:28.241
I will do everything in my power to help you.

Oh, and before I forget...

05:38.121 --> 05:40.121
- Bonjour, lnspecteur.
- Bonjour.

05:41.281 --> 05:43.281
(Policewoman speaks in French)

06:53.761 --> 06:56.641
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Don't flatter yourself.

06:56.801 --> 06:58.721
I do not get many visitors.

06:58.881 --> 07:02.201
And I got your little...present.

07:03.001 --> 07:07.281
I was simply trying to demonstrate
that the way I write about you in my book

07:07.441 --> 07:10.361
can paint you
in a very positive or negative light.

07:10.921 --> 07:14.521
You do want your story told, don't you?

07:14.681 --> 07:16.681
What do you want?

07:19.561 --> 07:22.241
It's about that man again.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.401
Vincent Bourg.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.081
He was on the solitary wing in this prison.

07:28.241 --> 07:31.441
The same one you were placed in
for your own protection.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.801
What about him?

07:35.641 --> 07:38.001
Well, I tried to get hold of him
while he was inside.

07:38.161 --> 07:40.161
But he declined to respond.

07:40.601 --> 07:43.721
Putain de merde, this case again.

07:46.201 --> 07:48.441
Did I not help you enough back then?

07:50.961 --> 07:52.961
What do you want with Vincent Bourg?

07:53.441 --> 07:55.441
He can help me.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.481
Because I know
what happened to Oliver Hughes.

08:02.961 --> 08:04.961
Did he talk to you?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.561
(Speaks French)

08:46.761 --> 08:48.441
<i>OK.</i>

08:48.601 --> 08:50.401
Merci.

08:57.881 --> 08:59.881
Here. Sit down, please.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.641
Do you know this man?

09:21.881 --> 09:24.281
Are you going to tell me
what this has to do with my son?

09:24.441 --> 09:26.441
His name is Greg Halpern.

09:27.081 --> 09:29.521
In February 2000 you assaulted him.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.361
He required stitches.

09:31.521 --> 09:33.521
Several ribs were bruised.

09:36.481 --> 09:39.041
Of course, you were never charged.

09:39.521 --> 09:45.561
But your financial record showed
an unusual cash withdrawal in February 2000.

09:45.721 --> 09:47.721
Paid to Mr Halpern.

09:50.681 --> 09:54.841
With Detective Walsh's help, I managed
to find the original incident reports.

09:55.081 --> 10:00.121
It's amazing, to put a man in hospital
and never see the inside of a police station.

10:01.721 --> 10:07.481
Lucky for you that your father-in-law is
a very experienced lawyer, non? Anyone else...

10:07.641 --> 10:11.801
Could you tell me what this has to do
with my son being abducted?

10:15.721 --> 10:17.721
Are you a violent man, Mr Hughes?

10:22.961 --> 10:29.881
In September 2004, your son was almost
three years old, you took him into hospital.

10:32.121 --> 10:36.161
He had a fracture on his ankle.

10:38.561 --> 10:40.481
You think I had something to do with this?

10:40.801 --> 10:42.961
- Did you?
- No.

10:44.161 --> 10:46.161
No way. No way. This is wrong.

10:48.321 --> 10:51.961
What happened with Greg,
it shouldn't have happened, OK?

10:52.121 --> 10:53.401
It was a mistake, that's all.

10:53.561 --> 10:55.481
Is that how your wife sees it?

10:55.641 --> 10:57.881
Physically assaulting this man, a mistake?

10:59.481 --> 11:01.481
Emily didn't know about it.

11:02.201 --> 11:05.001
Her father and I agreed that...

11:05.161 --> 11:07.161
she didn't need to know.

11:07.921 --> 11:09.961
She still doesn't and I'd like it to stay that way.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.521
We've got enough on our plate
at the moment.

11:12.681 --> 11:14.201
The night Oliver went missing,

11:14.361 --> 11:18.601
what were you doing
between the hours of 10:16pm and 10:25pm?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.961
Olly broke his foot
because he jumped off our bed.

11:21.121 --> 11:22.561
That's why he ended up in hospital.

11:22.721 --> 11:24.721
He jumped onto the floor, broke his ankle.

11:24.881 --> 11:29.041
- Where were you?
- This is insane. You can't possibly think...

11:33.601 --> 11:34.921
I was looking for Olly.

11:35.081 --> 11:36.441
My son.

11:36.601 --> 11:40.041
I was just running around looking everywhere
I could. Someone must have seen me.

11:40.201 --> 11:43.201
There are nine minutes in which no-one
can account for your whereabouts.

11:43.361 --> 11:45.241
Because they were
watching the fucking match!

11:45.401 --> 11:46.841
Jesus Christ, you can't think...

11:47.001 --> 11:50.121
Sit down. Sit down. Come on.

11:50.281 --> 11:53.961
You cannot possibly think I would ever, ever,
do anything to hurt my son!

11:54.641 --> 11:56.441
Tony, sit down.

12:00.881 --> 12:02.721
(Quietly) Oh, my 60¢

12:02.881 --> 12:04.881
Oh, Jesus.

12:06.201 --> 12:08.201
Oh, Christ.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.121
What if they don't, Mum?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.361
Tony is going to be out of that station.

13:18.641 --> 13:20.641
Soon.

13:22.881 --> 13:24.881
You look so tired.

13:25.081 --> 13:27.081
I can't sleep.

13:27.441 --> 13:29.601
I mean, I do, for a few minutes but then...

13:31.041 --> 13:33.041
I dream about him.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.601
And then I wake up
and I remember he's not here.

13:43.361 --> 13:45.361
I got you something.

13:49.761 --> 13:53.241
You can get them over the counter here
and they're not too strong.

13:53.961 --> 13:56.121
They'll just help you get some rest.

13:58.201 --> 14:00.201
I'm fine.

14:19.961 --> 14:22.481
JULIEN: Where were you?

14:22.881 --> 14:24.841
The changing rooms.

14:25.001 --> 14:27.121
Male and then female.

14:27.281 --> 14:29.641
Then back into the pool, then outside.

14:30.201 --> 14:31.841
Where?

14:32.001 --> 14:34.121
- Into the car park?
- Yeah, I think so. I mean...

14:34.281 --> 14:36.201
You have a demanding job, Mr Hughes.

14:36.361 --> 14:37.561
What?

14:37.721 --> 14:40.721
You've been taking phone calls from the office,
even on holiday.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.561
That puts a man under a great deal of stress,
no?

14:44.401 --> 14:45.961
Then your car breaks down.

14:46.121 --> 14:48.841
You find yourself stuck here, of all places.

14:49.361 --> 14:52.841
A man with a history of violence, under stress,

14:55.081 --> 14:57.041
was it too much?

14:57.201 --> 14:59.201
What?

15:00.401 --> 15:02.401
Did something happen?

15:05.281 --> 15:06.761
Help me understand.

15:06.921 --> 15:08.721
<i>No.</i>

15:10.281 --> 15:11.641
I, er...

15:13.361 --> 15:17.161
You say there's nine minutes
that I can't account for.

15:17.441 --> 15:19.001
I didn't have a car, it was being fixed,

15:19.161 --> 15:21.241
so where am I supposed to have gone
in nine minutes?

15:21.401 --> 15:22.761
There is a lake.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.401
In the woods, just behind the swimming pool.

15:27.521 --> 15:31.521
- Nine minutes would give you time...
- No, no.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.921
If you speak now,
the procureur will be easier on you.

15:34.081 --> 15:35.281
- (Knock)
- If not, it...

15:37.361 --> 15:38.601
(Speaks in French)

15:47.441 --> 15:49.441
I'm telling you the truth.

15:57.281 --> 15:59.281
I thought you were here to help.

15:59.681 --> 16:01.681
Not just sit there.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.881
Answer his questions.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.041
Then we can move on.

16:10.841 --> 16:12.441
(Low exchange in French)

16:21.601 --> 16:22.961
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

16:23.121 --> 16:24.561
No, it's OK.

16:24.721 --> 16:26.721
(They continue in French)

16:29.881 --> 16:32.201
Mark, this is Antoine Arnette.

16:32.361 --> 16:35.681
He's been undercover for 14 months
as Leon,

16:35.841 --> 16:38.481
working his way up the ranks
of an organisation.

16:38.641 --> 16:41.401
- The caids des cites.
- I'm connected to a Romanian outfit

16:41.561 --> 16:43.761
working out of Paris
but with links across Europe.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.921
Antoine...

16:46.281 --> 16:48.281

16:56.361 --> 16:58.321
What is so important?
What brought you here?

16:58.481 --> 17:02.361
The last two days,
the bosses have been distracted.

17:03.681 --> 17:06.241
They are transporting something.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.681
If it's drugs, usually, or weapons,
then we learn about it.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.601
But this...

17:12.761 --> 17:14.761
nothing.

17:15.481 --> 17:18.161
From what I understand,

17:18.320 --> 17:23.441
this package is to be transferred
from somewhere just outside Lille, to Thailand.

17:23.881 --> 17:25.761
Thailand?

17:25.921 --> 17:27.921
Sex trafficking.

17:30.641 --> 17:33.801
At three o'clock this afternoon

17:33.961 --> 17:38.841
in an abandoned warehouse
off the road leading into Lille.

17:40.201 --> 17:43.401
This is where they will be
handling the transaction.

18:17.001 --> 18:18.441
Listen, the reason I'm calling you

18:18.601 --> 18:24.801
is because I'm putting some money
into a fund for Tony and Emily Hughes.

18:25.441 --> 18:28.441
<i>An appeal, you know, a sort of
keeping up awareness kind of thing.</i>

18:28.601 --> 18:30.161
Most generous of you.

18:30.321 --> 18:36.121
If I were you, though, I would be most careful
about putting money in this case.

18:36.841 --> 18:40.441
<i>It seems Tony Hughes
is now being questioned in the matter.</i>

18:40.641 --> 18:42.641
<i>Oh.</i>

<i>You're welcome. Bye-bye, then.</i>

Hello, sweetheart.

19:01.481 --> 19:03.481
EMILY: I want to speak to my husband!

19:03.961 --> 19:06.801
I'm not going back to the hotel.
I want to speak to him now.

19:06.961 --> 19:09.161
I want to speak to my husband.

19:09.321 --> 19:11.321
I want to know what's going on!

19:13.041 --> 19:15.761
- What questions?
- They're just routine, I promise you.

19:15.921 --> 19:20.001
The best thing you can do
is to go back to the hotel and wait.

19:23.241 --> 19:27.841
You're supposed to be here to help us. Your
only purpose in this job is to keep us informed.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.881
So why don't you just do your bloody job?

19:30.041 --> 19:33.321
- (Speaks in French)
- I've got this. Thank you, thank you.

19:35.761 --> 19:37.161
Mrs Hughes,

19:37.321 --> 19:41.081
when Detective Baptiste is finished
with your husband, I will call you. I promise.

19:43.761 --> 19:45.841
Please just tell me what's happened.

19:55.681 --> 19:57.761
My son is gone.

20:00.001 --> 20:02.641
And he is the same age as yours.

20:05.081 --> 20:07.561
Just imagine, if somebody took him,

20:09.721 --> 20:11.721
and you didn't know where he was...

20:14.081 --> 20:16.081
...or what was happening to him.

20:17.081 --> 20:19.281
Please just tell me what's happening.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.601
Please...

20:24.681 --> 20:26.561
Please.

20:28.841 --> 20:30.841

Hey. I didn't hear you come in.

20:46.921 --> 20:47.961
You working?

20:48.121 --> 20:50.761
I'm just doing the lesson plan for the substitute.

20:50.921 --> 20:54.521
- Can't someone else do that?
- I volunteered. Keep myself busy.

20:57.441 --> 21:00.201
- Oh, thanks. They're lovely.
- And so they should be.

21:00.361 --> 21:02.801
Those are not run of the mill
petrol station flowers.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.601
No, those are the real McCoy.

21:07.161 --> 21:09.161
Tony's gone back to Châlons du Bois.

21:11.121 --> 21:13.121
Julian's with him.

21:13.481 --> 21:16.481
- They think they've found something.
- Yeah, I know.

21:21.841 --> 21:24.921
- You knew?
- Tony called. A couple of times.

21:28.961 --> 21:30.241
He called me?

21:30.401 --> 21:32.361
And you never...told me?

21:32.521 --> 21:34.521
Well, your dad had just died.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.561
I thought you had enough to deal with.

21:39.841 --> 21:45.081
I really don't need to be protected,
and I really don't need you lying to me. Ever.

21:45.241 --> 21:47.241
I'm sorry. It was stupid.

21:51.201 --> 21:53.201
Sorry.

21:58.721 --> 22:00.681
Do you think they've found something?

22:00.841 --> 22:02.841
I don't know.

22:03.441 --> 22:05.841
You're thinking of going back, aren't you?

22:10.001 --> 22:12.321
It's just, after last time...

22:13.881 --> 22:15.361
It can't happen again.

22:15.521 --> 22:16.641
I know.

22:16.801 --> 22:18.441
And Tony's phoned before.

22:18.601 --> 22:20.601
With "news".

22:21.121 --> 22:23.121
Lots of times.

22:26.921 --> 22:28.921
I remember.

22:40.041 --> 22:42.041
(Voice in French)

22:44.121 --> 22:46.121
Merci. Merci.

22:49.241 --> 22:51.081
Nothing.

22:51.241 --> 22:52.281
What?

22:52.441 --> 22:57.041
Fingerprints of the family, bien sûr,
but the room is clean.

22:57.281 --> 22:58.961
There must be something...

22:59.521 --> 23:01.521
Well...

23:02.121 --> 23:05.161
It is, I think, perhaps too clean.

23:06.401 --> 23:09.961
Like somebody was covering their tracks.
A very professional job.

23:10.601 --> 23:12.561
A basement like this, left undisturbed,

23:12.721 --> 23:17.121
would have prints that traced back
to maybe 15 or even 20 years ago.

23:18.321 --> 23:21.521
All we have is the picture
your son drew on the wall.

23:22.721 --> 23:26.121
It's strange, to leave that behind, no?

23:27.881 --> 23:30.241
Perhaps they didn't realise your son did it...

23:32.681 --> 23:34.321
So where does that leave us?

23:34.481 --> 23:39.601
The important thing is that for the first time in
eight years we know where Oliver was taken.

23:39.761 --> 23:40.761
Yes.

23:40.921 --> 23:45.921
The owners of the house were away,
so the first question is, who knew this?

23:46.281 --> 23:48.241
A postman who saw their house was vacant?

23:48.401 --> 23:52.041
Anyone who had knowledge that this house
would make a good hiding place.

23:53.641 --> 23:58.761
And we must consider
a small, suburban street such as this,

23:58.921 --> 24:02.801
perhaps somebody saw something unusual.

24:02.961 --> 24:05.001
<i>Mm.</i>

24:05.161 --> 24:10.921
So to answer your questions,
it leaves us with a lot more work to do.

24:11.321 --> 24:13.241
<i>OK.</i>

24:38.921 --> 24:40.921
(Ringtone)

24:42.001 --> 24:43.041
Julien Baptiste.

24:43.201 --> 24:44.521
<i>CELIA: Ah, he lives!</i>

24:44.681 --> 24:47.521
I'm sorry, darling,
I should have called earlier.

24:47.681 --> 24:49.681
You know, I've been busy with the...

24:51.561 --> 24:53.161
<i>The what?</i>

24:53.321 --> 24:55.321
<i>Finish your sentence, man!</i>

25:16.881 --> 25:18.881
The case has been re-opened.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.441
Of course it has.

25:21.601 --> 25:24.241
I know how you are
when you set your mind to something.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.081
There's a condition.

25:26.241 --> 25:28.121
I have to lead the investigation.

25:28.281 --> 25:29.961
(Sighs)

25:30.121 --> 25:33.921
I know. But, you know,
I'm the only one Georges trusts to be discreet

25:34.081 --> 25:36.641
and keep the investigation out of the press...

25:36.801 --> 25:39.161
Yeah...and you're the best.

25:39.321 --> 25:40.881
(Chuckles)

25:41.041 --> 25:44.001
Eh, you didn't come here just to see me,
did you?

25:45.561 --> 25:47.801
The joy of being married to a detective.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.121
No, I came here because...

25:54.521 --> 25:56.401
...it's happening again.

25:56.561 --> 25:58.561
And I don't know what to do.

25:59.321 --> 26:01.961
(Speaks French)

26:02.121 --> 26:04.601
Yeah. She came to the house.

26:04.761 --> 26:06.761
Did she hurt you?

26:07.561 --> 26:09.561
<i>No.</i>

26:11.161 --> 26:12.841
Tell me.

26:13.001 --> 26:15.001
(Speaks in French)

27:00.681 --> 27:02.361
Merci, Monsieur Georges.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.481
The timeline. Again.

27:06.401 --> 27:08.401
I've been over this with Baptiste.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.961
Then we will do it again.

27:17.681 --> 27:19.681
(Speaks in French)

27:21.321 --> 27:22.961
Seems that your lawyer has arrived.

27:23.121 --> 27:26.561
They cannot hold you any longer, Mr Hughes.
You are free to leave.

27:27.721 --> 27:29.721
(Speaks in French)

27:34.561 --> 27:39.481
OK. But until we have searched that lake
entirely, you will remain in Châlons du Bois.

27:39.641 --> 27:41.241
OK?

27:51.521 --> 27:52.761
There he is now.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.921
Ian? Did you do this?

27:56.241 --> 27:58.201
Listen, I am...

27:58.361 --> 28:01.441
- I need to let Emily know I'm OK.
- Yeah, it's all right.

28:01.721 --> 28:05.121
She'll want to know why I was taken in.
I'm going to have to tell her.

28:05.281 --> 28:07.961
- I'm going to take you for a drink first.
- Huh?

28:08.121 --> 28:09.481
We'll take the car.

28:09.641 --> 28:12.481
Because they say there's going to be a storm.

28:20.201 --> 28:21.441
(Julien speaks in French)

28:21.601 --> 28:23.521
(Continues)

29:06.441 --> 29:08.441
(Rumbles of thunder)

29:31.521 --> 29:33.441
Do they really think I could have done this?

29:33.601 --> 29:38.121
Why are they looking at me when they should
be looking at sick bastards like Vincent Bourg?

29:38.281 --> 29:40.561
- They let him go, didn't they?
- A known paedophile.

29:40.721 --> 29:43.681
Who used that pool regularly. Huh?

29:43.841 --> 29:45.681
Jesus.

29:45.841 --> 29:47.281
I saw his police file.

29:49.801 --> 29:51.041
How did you get that?

29:51.201 --> 29:52.721
Some journo trying to buy goodwill.

29:52.881 --> 29:55.761
Jesus, Ian, you want to see it.
The stuff they found on his computer...

29:55.921 --> 29:57.921
Don't go there, pal.

29:58.201 --> 29:59.921
OK?

30:00.081 --> 30:02.641
He is not your guy. They cleared him.

30:04.401 --> 30:07.281
Someone else is behind this,
and we're going to find them.

30:07.441 --> 30:10.601
That's what you've got to focus on,
moving forward.

30:12.881 --> 30:17.361
- I should get back. Em's going to be worried...
- Finish your drink. You need it.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.281
♪ Blues

30:27.641 --> 30:29.641
Why are you doing this, Ian?

30:30.761 --> 30:33.521
First the money, then the lawyer...now this.

30:35.561 --> 30:37.561
I've been kicked before.

30:37.761 --> 30:41.121
I've been laid low. No-one there to help me.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.881
I don't want that for you.

30:52.001 --> 30:54.481
God, I love this bloody song.

30:54.641 --> 30:56.561
It's not a patch on the original.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.241
You're a blues man?

30:58.401 --> 31:00.521
Who couldn't love Robert Johnson?

31:00.681 --> 31:04.441
Selling his soul to the Devil at the crossroads,
best decision he ever made.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.881
(Laughs) Ah, you know that voice, eh?

31:08.641 --> 31:10.961
The tone of it. It's like...

31:11.121 --> 31:13.361
- You can feel him aching.
- Yeah.

31:15.561 --> 31:18.761
You know, always makes me feel better
about my own life.

31:28.561 --> 31:29.761
(Distant thunder)

31:41.001 --> 31:42.401
(Whispers in French)

31:42.561 --> 31:44.481
(Replies in French)

31:44.641 --> 31:46.121
(Continue in French)

32:30.561 --> 32:32.561
(Police shouting in French)

33:00.961 --> 33:02.961
(Claps of thunder)

33:06.041 --> 33:08.041
(Barrage of questions)

33:17.441 --> 33:20.321
You should've given me that interview,
Mr Hughes.

33:20.561 --> 33:23.561
But it doesn't matter.

33:23.721 --> 33:25.481
I got you your front page.

33:30.361 --> 33:32.361
(Barrage of questions continues)

34:03.121 --> 34:05.121
Em, I was going to tell you...

34:06.761 --> 34:08.761
When?

34:09.481 --> 34:12.761
When were you going to tell me
that you put Greg Halpern in hospital?

34:12.920 --> 34:16.440
And then you got my dad
to help you buy his silence?

34:16.601 --> 34:19.561
- It's not your dad's fault.
- Olly was just a baby.

34:19.721 --> 34:23.241
I didn't think a prison sentence
for the father would benefit anyone.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.601
You didn't think to tell your own daughter?

34:25.761 --> 34:27.880
Tony knew it would upset you.

34:28.041 --> 34:31.360
- It wasn't my place to go against his wishes.
- Not your place? You're my Dad!

34:31.521 --> 34:34.001
- Sweetheart, listen...
- Get out. Get out!

34:39.601 --> 34:41.601
Come on.

34:45.801 --> 34:49.201
This is why the police
are wasting time looking into you

34:49.360 --> 34:51.561
when they should be looking for our son.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.880
- It was a mistake.
- What, lying to me?

34:56.041 --> 34:57.601
Or beating the crap out of my friend?

34:57.761 --> 34:59.521
He wasn't exactly a...

35:01.041 --> 35:02.641
- What?
- Forget it.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.801
What did you say?

35:09.281 --> 35:11.201
He was more than a friend.

35:11.361 --> 35:15.441
Oh, Christ, I told you, at the time,
there was nothing going on.

35:15.721 --> 35:18.081
I went to him
and he admitted you kissed him.

35:19.761 --> 35:21.041
I am not the problem here, Tony.

35:21.201 --> 35:24.041
The problem here is your utter inability
to ever let anything go.

35:24.201 --> 35:27.401
- You fixate on every little detail.
- I pay attention, there's a difference.

35:27.561 --> 35:30.761
If you'd been paying attention
our son wouldn't be gone!

35:46.921 --> 35:48.921
(Door opens and shuts)

36:01.121 --> 36:02.281
JULIEN: We should begin.

36:02.441 --> 36:03.601
TONY: A few more minutes.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.801
JULIEN: They're volunteering their time.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.881
If we wait any longer, they may start to leave.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.441
There were 50 names on that list.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.961
Everyone that lived near the house
where Olly was held.

36:12.121 --> 36:13.721
I thought the idea was to get them all together

36:13.881 --> 36:16.081
so they could share memories
and trigger something.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.441
Yes, yes, but we could stand around all night.

36:18.601 --> 36:20.601
We must work with what we have.

36:22.041 --> 36:24.041
(Speaks in French)

36:35.521 --> 36:37.521
(Interrupts in French)

36:37.681 --> 36:39.681
Tony... (Continues in French)

37:09.841 --> 37:11.841
(Julien continues)

37:21.281 --> 37:22.921
You got my calls, then?

37:23.081 --> 37:25.921
Yeah. I'm sorry it just took me a little while to,
you know...

37:28.721 --> 37:30.721
You look well.

37:30.961 --> 37:32.081
Ah, it's your hair.

37:32.241 --> 37:33.521
I like it.

37:33.681 --> 37:35.681
Yeah, it took a few misfires.

37:39.481 --> 37:41.481
It's been a long time.

37:41.921 --> 37:43.681
Yeah.

37:43.841 --> 37:45.361
How did you know we were up there?

37:45.521 --> 37:46.801
Laurence told me.

37:46.961 --> 37:50.281
I went to the commissariat and they
filled me in on where you are on the case.

37:50.441 --> 37:51.721
If you can even call it that.

37:51.881 --> 37:53.881
It's the best lead we've had since it happened.

37:54.041 --> 37:55.801
There's no DNA evidence.

37:55.961 --> 37:58.921
Julien had to blackmail Georges
to even get the case re-opened.

37:59.081 --> 38:00.401
No, we're close, I know it.

38:00.561 --> 38:06.081
What? You really think this little
village meeting is going to lead us to our son?

38:06.241 --> 38:08.801
Last year it was the sighting in Toulouse
that had to be him.

38:08.961 --> 38:12.481
The year before that it was the skeleton
they dragged out of the Mediterranean.

38:12.641 --> 38:16.321
- What about the scarf, the drawing?
- There's nothing else there, Tony.

38:16.841 --> 38:19.441
No DNA. No proof. No evidence.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.801
I mean, even if we let ourselves believe

38:21.961 --> 38:25.481
that our only son was trapped in there,
for God knows what reason,

38:25.641 --> 38:28.881
what, the last remaining image
we have of our son is going to be that?

38:29.041 --> 38:31.041
It's OK to be scared by it.

38:35.601 --> 38:39.961
You're looking at shapes in the clouds
and you're trying to turn them into things.

38:40.121 --> 38:43.801
And every time you do this
you drag me into it too because...

38:46.321 --> 38:48.041
...because you know I want to see them too.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.681
You know that I need to see them
as much as you do.

38:50.841 --> 38:55.881
And every time I do it breaks my heart
into pieces all over again.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.041
I'm not as strong as you.

38:59.001 --> 39:02.201
I can't survive in a nightmare
the way that you do.

39:02.361 --> 39:05.001
I have to try and live, Tony.

39:05.881 --> 39:08.081
I have to try and have some kind of a life.

39:14.521 --> 39:17.361
You're doing a pretty good job of it
as far as I can tell.

39:32.521 --> 39:34.521
Oh, I forgot to say...

39:34.681 --> 39:36.681
Congratulations.

40:19.721 --> 40:21.721
(Doorbell)

40:41.121 --> 40:43.121
Mr Bourg?

40:44.521 --> 40:46.361
Mr Bourg, it's Malik Suri.

40:46.881 --> 40:48.401
I wrote to you while you were in prison

40:48.561 --> 40:52.281
and if you read any of those letters,
you'd know I just want to talk.

40:59.121 --> 41:01.721
It wasn't easy finding this address, Mr Bourg.

41:03.001 --> 41:04.681
I just want to talk to you.

41:04.841 --> 41:06.641
It's about Oliver Hughes.

41:15.961 --> 41:18.841
Mr Bourg, I just want to talk.

41:27.241 --> 41:29.241
(Engine starts)

41:43.081 --> 41:45.281
(Julien speaks quietly in French)

41:53.081 --> 41:54.401
<i>Oui.</i>

41:54.561 --> 41:56.001
The electric company checks out.

41:56.161 --> 41:58.441
No-one came to read the meter at No.75

41:58.601 --> 42:01.361
for at least three months
since your son was taken there.

42:01.521 --> 42:03.521
We're wasting our time.

42:04.161 --> 42:07.161
No-one's calling back.
That meeting was a joke.

42:07.321 --> 42:10.401
Well, look,
I did not expect results straightaway.

42:10.561 --> 42:12.121
- I am sure...
- You're sure of what?

42:12.281 --> 42:13.921
No-one saw or heard anything.

42:14.081 --> 42:16.081
Why else would they keep silent for so long?

42:16.241 --> 42:18.161
Look, we'll press on.

42:18.321 --> 42:20.561
Try again, fail again.

42:20.721 --> 42:21.761
Fail better.

42:21.921 --> 42:23.881
(Low exchange in French)

42:48.441 --> 42:51.681
Have you met anyone since your divorce?

42:51.841 --> 42:53.841
<i>No.</i>

42:54.481 --> 42:55.521
Well...

42:55.681 --> 42:57.681
Perhaps one day, though.

43:02.281 --> 43:04.281
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

43:05.601 --> 43:07.281
(Speaks in French)

43:08.601 --> 43:11.441
I heard about your little town meeting
last night.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.361
If the case is to be re-opened,
I must do it properly.

43:20.521 --> 43:21.721
That's why this meeting was...

43:21.881 --> 43:24.481
I'm just trying to protect the people
that live here.

43:24.641 --> 43:28.681
Some of them have lost their jobs
because of that kind of bad publicity.

43:29.721 --> 43:33.001
Now I asked you to do this quietly
for a reason.

43:33.161 --> 43:36.881
This case can be closed
as quickly as it was re-opened.

43:41.081 --> 43:43.401
What the hell does he mean by that?

43:43.561 --> 43:45.361
He is simply covering his back.

43:47.121 --> 43:49.721
- I need to get out of here.
- It's not finished.

43:50.481 --> 43:53.761
- We have more calls to do.
- For all the good they're doing.

43:57.561 --> 43:59.281
(Man talks softly in French)

44:05.801 --> 44:08.601
(Julien speaks in French)

44:11.721 --> 44:13.361
You all right?

44:13.521 --> 44:15.161
It's Antoine.

44:15.321 --> 44:17.441
He heard about the storage warehouse.

44:20.521 --> 44:24.001
He doesn't know what happened,
but he says he has more information.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.641
- He wants to meet me at eight.
- Bit of a wait.

44:26.881 --> 44:30.681
- But it's good news, right?
- Well... (Speaks French)

44:33.761 --> 44:38.001
When I confronted him with his drug use,
he said he was maintaining his cover.

44:38.401 --> 44:39.681
But I think it's more than that.

44:39.841 --> 44:41.361
I called his superior.

44:41.521 --> 44:45.521
Apparently he's fallen for a woman,
a junkie connected to the people he works for.

44:45.761 --> 44:47.841
I thought it was too good to be true.

44:48.001 --> 44:49.801
We'll find out.

45:33.201 --> 45:34.521
Emily!

46:44.561 --> 46:45.961
Agh!

47:21.801 --> 47:23.401
(Winces)

47:57.321 --> 47:59.321
<i>Olly...</i>

48:01.361 --> 48:03.361
Olly.

48:10.121 --> 48:11.841
We were so worried.

48:17.641 --> 48:19.361
(Whispers)

48:24.641 --> 48:26.161
Been so worried.

48:31.801 --> 48:33.801
We were so worried.

48:35.241 --> 48:36.521
So worried.

48:38.241 --> 48:40.241
We were so worried...

49:00.721 --> 49:02.721
(Door shuts)

49:40.401 --> 49:42.401
Hey!

49:44.801 --> 49:46.801
(Shouts in French)

49:58.921 --> 50:00.921
(Continues in French)

50:07.041 --> 50:08.841
Vincent Bourg?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.841
I'm Tony Hughes.

50:17.601 --> 50:19.121
This is criminal.

50:19.281 --> 50:21.281
Get out.

50:22.201 --> 50:24.201
Get out!

50:24.761 --> 50:26.761
I will call the police.

50:27.561 --> 50:30.281
- I will do it.
- Go on. Call them.

50:32.121 --> 50:34.121
Don't come any closer!

50:36.041 --> 50:38.041
You went to that pool regularly.

50:39.321 --> 50:41.321
I know what you are.

50:44.281 --> 50:46.281
Where is he?

50:48.401 --> 50:50.241
Where's my boy?

50:53.161 --> 50:55.281
I did not take your son.

50:55.961 --> 50:57.961
You must believe me about this.

50:59.321 --> 51:02.201
I do not let my dreams become reality.

51:02.801 --> 51:07.401
I do not act on my desires. I only look.

51:11.601 --> 51:13.601
(Choking)

51:29.841 --> 51:31.841
(Clock chimes)

51:54.481 --> 51:56.481
<i>(Announcement in French)</i>

52:31.081 --> 52:33.081

52:43.521 --> 52:45.081

52:53.441 --> 52:55.441

53:15.681 --> 53:17.601

53:17.761 --> 53:19.761

56:10.401 --> 56:12.281
What's going on?

56:13.201 --> 56:14.921
Where have you been?

56:15.081 --> 56:18.041
We tried to call.
Your mobile was left here on the desk.

56:18.201 --> 56:20.281
What is it? Have you found something?

56:23.281 --> 56:27.241
The people who lived opposite No.70
back in 2006,

56:28.721 --> 56:31.441
they got our message late last night.

56:32.721 --> 56:34.921
It seems they are big football fans.

56:35.081 --> 56:38.281
The night of the quarterfinal
they threw a party.

56:40.641 --> 56:42.641
And they filmed it.

56:49.681 --> 56:51.801
What's on the tape? What did they film?

56:52.801 --> 56:54.801
Are you sure you want to see this?

57:05.201 --> 57:07.201

57:16.401 --> 57:18.601

- You see that window here?

57:18.761 --> 57:20.761
Yeah.

57:21.401 --> 57:22.641
What?

57:22.801 --> 57:24.801
We've zoomed in on it.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.681
Here.

57:26.841 --> 57:28.321
