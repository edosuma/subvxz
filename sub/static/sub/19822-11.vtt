21:05.365 --> 21:08.466
We know you gave away the Blue Diamond.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.370
How do you know all this?

21:19.679 --> 21:21.112
We had to stop you

21:21.114 --> 21:23.414
from making an enormous mistake

21:23.416 --> 21:25.916
handing this over to Saganash,

21:25.918 --> 21:28.286
so we... intervened.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.655
We'll keep it here for now.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.796
We assume you are familiar
with the Red Diamond?

21:38.798 --> 21:43.334
♪♪

21:43.336 --> 21:45.202
The Red Diamond? The Red Diamond?
