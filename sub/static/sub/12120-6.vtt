WEBVTT

00:58.220 --> 00:59.890
I sound pretty good.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.770
You're the Jennifer Holliday
of Tuvan throat singing.

01:02.850 --> 01:05.940
Thanks to your voice,
crops are bigger and better than ever.

01:06.020 --> 01:11.280
I mean...
have you ever seen anything so bulbous?

01:11.360 --> 01:14.650
Well, that's a trick question,
to which I will answer, "perhaps."

01:14.740 --> 01:18.660
You know what? I'm making you dinner.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.740
-You are?
-Yep.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.000
Tomorrow night.
I make a mean veggie tagine.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.580
We can talk about
what varieties to plant next.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.130
I'm thinking Japanese for hardiness.

01:30.210 --> 01:33.710
I would hate for my lube
to lack hardiness.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.180
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
This is my favorite part.

01:37.260 --> 01:40.180
Hmm.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.560
Good morning, Grace.

01:49.650 --> 01:53.150
How about a kale smoothie?
Fresh from the farm.

01:53.230 --> 01:56.900
No, thank you. I already didn't drink
the one you gave me yesterday.

01:56.990 --> 01:58.490
Oh, my.

01:58.570 --> 02:02.450
Did all the other fancy ladies get beamed
back up into the mothership without you?

02:02.540 --> 02:05.410
I'm saying goodbye to the old me.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.960
This is a bon voyage party for her
and her country club clothes.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.580
You gonna burn 'em? 'Cause if you don't,

02:10.669 --> 02:13.340
we could make an army
out of business casual scarecrows.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.840
-I'm donating them.
-Good for you.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.970
Bon voyage, tiny pantsuits.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.390
You'll make some
little doll women very happy.

02:20.470 --> 02:23.100
Am I to assume you had another
business meeting with Jacob

02:23.180 --> 02:26.640
or are you returning a ring
to Middle-earth?

02:26.730 --> 02:30.100
I don't know why you wag your eyebrows
when you say "business meeting."

02:30.190 --> 02:32.650
And we are having
a business dinner tomorrow night.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.820
It's not a business dinner.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.820
What do you call
talking about seed varieties

02:36.900 --> 02:39.530
while we eat a tagine
made from surplus vegetables?

02:39.610 --> 02:44.040
It's a date. It's a sad, weird,
hippie date, but it's a date nonetheless.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.580
No, I've seen the way he looks at you.

02:45.660 --> 02:48.160
Oh, you can see that,
but you can't see chemtrails

02:48.250 --> 02:50.370
or all the people who live
under the San Diego river.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.880
Don't you have somewhere to go?

02:51.960 --> 02:57.010
I do and that's why I can't listen to your
romantic notions and chemtrail blather.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.050
-That was you!
-They're real and I'm right.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.430
Oh, jeez.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.730
So, what do you think?

03:14.570 --> 03:15.940
<i>Maybe let the seams out a little?</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:19.320
-Oh, my. Can you sit?
<i>-Let's see.</i>

03:21.610 --> 03:23.950
<i>No. It's a no-go.</i>

03:24.030 --> 03:27.830
<i>I love this suit.</i>
<i>It's from our London trip.</i>

03:27.910 --> 03:30.160
Dad, don't worry,
I know a tailor who can work magic.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.170
<i>This much magic?</i>

03:32.250 --> 03:33.290
He does everything.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.250
Believe me, I have become
quite a fan of the elastic waistband.

03:36.340 --> 03:39.130
Well, I thought with all the weight
I'd lost since the hospital,

03:39.210 --> 03:40.720
I could pull it off.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.350
<i> Now I'm not even sure</i>
<i>I can actually pull it off.</i>

03:46.260 --> 03:49.850
<i>Oh, dear. Uh, hon,</i>
<i>maybe you should hit "end call."</i>

03:49.930 --> 03:51.770
<i>-This won't be pretty.</i>
-OK.

03:53.350 --> 03:56.270
Oh, these are beautiful.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.740
Thank you. This is so generous.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.240
You have no idea how happy I am
to be rid of them.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.870
-Oh.
-Oh. "A Change of A Dress."

04:04.950 --> 04:07.160
I just got it. Oh, that's clever.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.500
Thank you. I had to fight for it.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.410
You hear that, Carol? Another name fan.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.040
Whatever.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.920
- This is really impressive.
- We help a lot of women.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.880
Some come in just to get clothes, but we
also do job placement and mentoring.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.180
Oh.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.140
I will be right back
with your donation receipt.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.010
Hm.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.100
May I?

04:29.180 --> 04:32.100
Of course. Oh, it fits you perfectly.

04:32.190 --> 04:35.310
Not everyone can carry off canary yellow.
We're the lucky ones.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.820
It's not too bright?
I'm interviewing to be a bank teller.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.230
You wear a bright color like that,
you'll be even more memorable.

04:41.110 --> 04:45.280
If you really want to stand out, after
the interview, mail them a thank you note.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.240
It's more personal than a-- than an email.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.080
But the trick is, write it ahead of time

04:49.160 --> 04:50.950
and then slip it in the mailbox
as you leave.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.080
That's a great idea.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.500
I would've never thought of that.
Thank you.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.250
You're welcome.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.550
Tell me-- Tell me more
about this mentoring thing.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.670
Oh, of course.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.430
Ta-da!

05:05.510 --> 05:10.140
Wow... It's very vaginal.

05:10.220 --> 05:13.270
I don't mean to toot my own horn,
but I think it's my best work

05:13.390 --> 05:15.440
-since <i>Hitler's Circumcision.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.980
I don't know if you know,
but <i>Hitler's Circumcision</i>

05:18.060 --> 05:21.190
is in the private collection
of one Mr. Kenny Loggins.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.070
Yes. Who saw it in Sol's office
and bought it on the spot.

05:24.150 --> 05:25.740
I love that story.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.780
The thing is, we want your lube

05:28.870 --> 05:31.120
-in every store in America.
-Yes, yes!

05:31.200 --> 05:33.450
And pubic hair might be
making a comeback,

05:33.540 --> 05:35.620
there's just so very, very much of it.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.380
Alas, our rigid Western

05:38.460 --> 05:40.170
-standards of beauty.
-Yeah.

05:40.250 --> 05:44.420
Still, I do want to be
in every store in America. Ta-da.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.340
OK. Yes, this is closer.
I can't really tell what it is.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.100
Thank you.
I painted this one <i>with</i> my vagina.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.520
You need a long brush
and a very strong pelvic floor.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.600
Brianna, I just--

05:56.690 --> 06:00.650
Sorry. I'll-I'll come back. Oh. Wow.

06:00.730 --> 06:04.740
See? Imagine him walking
around a supermarket looking for...

06:04.820 --> 06:06.650
oat bran. This would catch his eye.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.410
That would definitely catch my eye.

06:08.490 --> 06:11.620
-Frankie, this is Barry, our accountant.
-Barry.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.160
I was just checking if you looked at
my projections for year-end taxes.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.410
Yes, did you, uh, declare
the new emulsifier as a capital expense?

06:17.500 --> 06:19.460
Ah! Angela Merkel.

06:19.540 --> 06:23.090
Why don't you two just
get on the table and do it?

06:23.170 --> 06:25.090
Excuse me?

06:25.170 --> 06:28.800
No seriously,
how long has this been going on?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.720
What-- What is this?
A conversation about tax season?

06:31.800 --> 06:34.220
No. I know what I'm talking about.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.930
-I am an intuitive witch.
-OK.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.190
Thank you, Goody Proctor.

06:38.270 --> 06:41.610
Actually, she wasn't a witch.
Kinda the whole point of <i> The Crucible.</i>

06:41.690 --> 06:43.570
I was in it in high school.

06:43.650 --> 06:47.240
Well, I have to move my car,
I'm in a loading zone.

06:47.320 --> 06:52.990
Uh, good day. No, not "good day," uh...
Obviously, I'll be right back.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.950
How did she know about us?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.500
I don't know, but clearly we need to be
more careful around here.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.670
Or, we could finally... come out?

07:01.750 --> 07:04.540
We've talked about this.
Barry, I'm the boss, you work under me,

07:04.630 --> 07:06.130
and that's a joke everyone will make.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.630
OK, for a minute. Who cares?

07:07.710 --> 07:09.880
Why do we have to tell anyone anything?

07:09.970 --> 07:12.720
Because that's what people
who are dating do.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.800
Why do they do that?

07:13.890 --> 07:16.770
Aren't you sick of staggering
our entrances?

07:16.850 --> 07:18.520
No, I like it.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.230
Or trying not to look at each other
too much during meetings?

07:21.310 --> 07:25.570
Your shirt popped open yesterday
and everyone could see your bra.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.610
And I didn't want you
to flash the whole office,

07:27.690 --> 07:30.900
but I was afraid even acknowledging
you have breasts

07:30.990 --> 07:33.910
would somehow give us away.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.040
I like being with you.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.490
I don't want to hide anymore.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.790
You're right. We will tell everyone.

07:39.870 --> 07:40.910
Thank you.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.330
Eventually.

07:44.540 --> 07:45.540
-Great.
-Eventually.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.500
Yeah, we'll see.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.550
Hey, you guys!
Barry from Accounting and I are doing it.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.640
On the regs. And if you have
a problem with that, Cindy, you're fired.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.560
And also, thank you for telling me
my bra was showing yesterday.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.230
You're fired for that, too.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.360
Everybody knows.
Nobody cares. Love today's bra.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.020
Damn it.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.190
Gina said they don't usually
approve mentors this quickly,

08:09.280 --> 08:12.320
but she was so impressed
with the advice I gave

08:12.410 --> 08:16.450
and with my business background
that she wanted me to start right away.

08:16.530 --> 08:21.080
Oh, I'm sorry, I lost track,
uh, around "Gina said."

08:22.120 --> 08:23.750
You know, this is exciting for me.

08:23.830 --> 08:26.210
You have your yams
and whatever else you do.

08:26.290 --> 08:30.510
I-- I need something. I...
I need a purpose and this might be it.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.340
You're right. I'm happy for you.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.929
See, isn't it nice to be nice to the nice?

08:36.010 --> 08:37.549
I have been nice before.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.850
It's been ages since I stole
a Christmas goose from a crippled child.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.900
She's here. How do I look?

08:44.980 --> 08:47.440
Uh, like a docent at a hair spray museum.

08:48.860 --> 08:52.690
Just answer the door. I...
I need to de-poof.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.700
Oh, this poor kid.
She's not gonna know what hit her.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.410
You Grace? It took me
frickin' forever to find this place.

08:59.490 --> 09:02.330
There's like no street parking
and your neighbor's dog is a dick.

09:02.410 --> 09:05.210
She'll be fine.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.460
All right, let's start with the basics.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.720
-Do you have a résumé?
-I do.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.220
It flew out of my car window
while I was driving here.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.930
That's OK. We'll start from scratch.
Um, what work experience do you have?

09:23.020 --> 09:26.440
-I was in the Army for a while.
-Great. How long did you serve?

09:26.520 --> 09:28.230
Top secret.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.110
OK.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.990
Do you have any
customer service experience?

09:35.070 --> 09:36.610
-Baskin-Robbins.
-Good.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.160
Best three days of my life.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.120
OK. Do you have a job now?

09:44.120 --> 09:46.620
-Yeah. I'm a bartender, but...
-But?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.210
I don't want to be working for tips
or cleaning things with a rag

09:50.290 --> 09:52.960
the rest of my life. It's like
nobody fucking sees me. I'm invisible.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.430
I have more to offer than people think.

09:56.510 --> 09:59.050
I know what you mean.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.260
What would you like to be doing?

10:04.350 --> 10:07.100
-I want to be Diane.
-Who's Diane?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.900
She works in my doctor's office.
She isn't a doctor or a nurse,

10:09.980 --> 10:11.150
but she bosses 'em all around.

10:11.230 --> 10:13.860
And they listen to her
because she knows everything.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.360
Except for all the gross medical stuff,
which I have zero interest in.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.320
Sounds like she might be
an office manager.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.740
That sounds good. I want that.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.330
It isn't that easy.
You don't have any office experience.

10:23.410 --> 10:25.580
You know, there's a few steps
between where you are now

10:25.660 --> 10:27.790
-and where you want to go.
-Ugh. Steps?

10:27.870 --> 10:29.710
That's what my stupid sponsor's
always bugging me about.

10:29.790 --> 10:34.000
Alcoholism isn't funny. OK, I think
we need to hone your interviewing skills

10:34.090 --> 10:36.970
and your image that you project
to the world.

10:38.090 --> 10:41.390
-What was wrong with my image?
-It's specific.

10:41.470 --> 10:44.470
Look, I'm not gonna start taking shit
from anybody, including you,

10:44.560 --> 10:45.850
just because I need a job.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.270
Well, that's unfortunate.

10:47.350 --> 10:51.150
Because short of being a pirate,
taking shit is part of every job.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.650
I thought mentors were supposed to be
all nice and encouraging.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.980
This is me being nice and encouraging.

10:56.070 --> 10:57.990
God, you're like
a two-legged version of my mom.

10:58.070 --> 11:00.070
You went to A Change of A Dress
for a reason. Right?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.490
I mean, you probably are right,
you have more to offer,

11:02.580 --> 11:05.700
but nobody's gonna see that
unless you drop the attitude.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.160
I know what I'm doing.
I could actually help you get a great job.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.500
-How?
-I was in the business world a long time.

11:11.580 --> 11:12.960
I was good at it.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.630
My daughter runs my old business,
I could have her meet with you,

11:15.710 --> 11:18.260
but I'm not gonna waste her time,
or mine,

11:18.340 --> 11:22.640
unless you start listening to what
I say and doing what I tell you to do.

11:23.470 --> 11:24.680
You sound like Diane.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.810
I'm better than Diane.

11:26.890 --> 11:28.310
Do you want my help or not?

11:28.390 --> 11:29.850
Fuck yeah, I want your help.

11:31.140 --> 11:34.110
No, cross your legs.
And stop chewing your nails.

11:34.190 --> 11:39.030
What do you consider your strengths
as a-- as an employee? Stop that.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.450
Quick reaction time.

11:42.490 --> 11:43.570
-Ready?
-OK.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.160
How do you do? Yeah--

11:46.240 --> 11:47.580
You're not fusing metal.

11:48.660 --> 11:51.460
- And your weaknesses?
- Oof! Wow.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.710
I don't know. I have so many.
Uh, I'm late a lot,

11:54.790 --> 11:57.380
I always lose like three sets of keys,
I've got a bad temper, I--

11:57.460 --> 12:00.550
Oh. OK, instead of saying
you have a bad temper,

12:00.630 --> 12:02.930
try saying you feel passionate
about your work.

12:03.010 --> 12:06.970
I am passionate about my work.
I hated every job I ever had.

12:08.810 --> 12:13.310
All right, Bud said this should
bring you up to speed on all your cases.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.440
Got it. Thanks.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.480
Oh, uh, Dad wanted me to remind you

12:16.570 --> 12:19.530
to not to try and lift the box yourself
and to take plenty of breaks

12:19.610 --> 12:21.110
as you read through the Walker file.

12:21.190 --> 12:24.070
And just a general hope,
I think, that you'll stay hydrated.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.070
Oh, boy.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.870
-He's worried about you.
-I know, and God love him,

12:27.950 --> 12:29.870
but he won't let me do anything.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.290
For just one day I'd like to,
I don't know,

12:33.370 --> 12:35.920
rake the leaves in the backyard,
eat something with salt,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.380
take a shower without having to
sit on that little stool.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.800
That's my old stool.
It's got Ninja Turtles on top.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.680
Listen, kiddo. I need a favor.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.430
Friday is my last day of freedom
before I have to go back to work.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.140
I need you to take him out to lunch.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.680
I gotta have one day for myself.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.350
He really enjoys having lunch
with you every day. What do I tell him?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.440
Here's $50, you'll think of somethin'.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.270
Lunch for two plus $40? Score!

12:59.360 --> 13:01.070
-Thanks, Coyote.
-Thank you!

13:01.150 --> 13:03.490
-Get out here!
-I feel stupid, OK?

13:03.570 --> 13:05.110
This shirt's an idiot.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.530
Very good. Stop futzing.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.410
Hmm.

13:10.330 --> 13:13.000
What the hell are you doing?
You have a migraine or something?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.960
I'm trying to imagine
what you'll look like at the interview

13:15.040 --> 13:16.880
without that bracelet in your nose.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.960
What interview?

13:18.040 --> 13:21.250
You have an interview with my daughter.
Friday. Two o'clock sharp.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.840
No pressure. Just practice.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.130
Unless you ace it.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.590
Which nobody does
wearing a door knocker on their face.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.100
Do you have a problem with the way I look?

13:29.180 --> 13:31.640
-Just name me one successful person--
-Lenny Kravitz.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.140
Uh... not in show business.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.890
Indira Gandhi.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.020
Touché.

13:39.110 --> 13:42.030
No dumb chick, huh?
She ran India and shit.

13:42.110 --> 13:45.450
No. No dumb chick.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.030
Did you really set up
that interview up for me?

13:48.110 --> 13:49.370
I did.

13:50.660 --> 13:51.910
OK.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.590
-Well, Jacob...
-Mm-hmm?

14:01.670 --> 14:06.720
I think this is where we can
officially say you went up and did it.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.800
Admit it, you were a little nervous
when you heard the word "tagine."

14:09.890 --> 14:13.100
But I Googled it and I laughed
at the little pot.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.430
I was at corporate yesterday.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.100
-You mean... Brianna?
-Yeah.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.360
Things are happening.

14:20.440 --> 14:25.190
And I want you to know, no matter
how massive this lube thing gets,

14:25.280 --> 14:28.030
I will always be supportive
of the organic...

14:29.570 --> 14:31.370
local...

14:31.450 --> 14:32.910
There. Sorry.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.460
I didn't want you
to get tagine in your hair.

14:37.830 --> 14:38.830
There.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.960
So how did you get into the yam business
in the first place?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.210
I was an engineer at Lockheed.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.800
And I kind of hated
being an engineer at Lockheed.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.600
You know how people talk about
quitting their jobs,

14:51.680 --> 14:53.930
moving to Vermont and making cheese?

14:54.010 --> 14:55.640
You're the guy who actually did it.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.180
Except with yams. In California.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.150
Aren't you sumpin' sumpin'.

15:00.230 --> 15:04.690
The first year, I made $53.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.280
I had to send half of that to my ex-wife.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.820
You were married?

15:08.900 --> 15:09.900
I told you that.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.240
No, you didn't. I would have remembered.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.700
We got married too young.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.660
But she's a good person
and we're still friends.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.250
So you have a Sol.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.460
Only you... have a Sol.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.880
How about... something to drink?

15:29.970 --> 15:30.930
I have something.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.850
How about something else?

15:32.930 --> 15:34.140
Frankie...

15:36.180 --> 15:37.470
What are we doing here?

15:37.560 --> 15:41.310
Um, what do you mean? You're thirsty,
I'm gonna get you a backup drink.

15:41.390 --> 15:44.770
No, I mean this. Us.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.280
What are we doing?

15:47.360 --> 15:49.570
We're having a business dinner.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.740
Wow.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.490
I thought it was a date.

15:53.570 --> 15:54.910
You thought it was a date?

15:54.990 --> 15:56.830
Of course it's a date.

15:57.910 --> 16:02.040
I cooked you 11 vegetable dishes
and I'm wearing a sport coat.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.750
What do you think we're doing?

16:04.710 --> 16:07.920
Nothing. I-- Well, not nothing.
I mean, friendship.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.880
The yam pipeline.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.090
Is that all you want?

16:11.170 --> 16:13.840
I... Well, you know--

16:13.930 --> 16:17.510
Whatever you're afraid of happening,
it's already happened.

16:19.470 --> 16:24.560
I think you like me as much as I like you.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.770
I do like you.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.270
But?

16:28.360 --> 16:30.320
I didn't say "but."

16:31.110 --> 16:33.200
Yeah, you did.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.450
Jacob...

16:36.160 --> 16:37.410
I get it.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.750
We'll keep it just business.

16:46.670 --> 16:50.210
Anyway, he had tattoos,
but not the good kind of tattoos.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.090
You know, like the sexy electricians
with the big, nice, thick forearms.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.590
You know, that guy?

16:55.680 --> 17:00.810
No, these were faded and wrinkly
like a sad old sailor.

17:00.890 --> 17:03.180
-No.
-But you slept with him?

17:03.270 --> 17:05.310
He had a cute dog.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.400
-What about you?
-No one since Asian Larry Hagman.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.940
Oh. Frankie, are you out there yet,
having fun?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.900
Actually, I need to talk to you guys.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.150
It's about...

17:15.910 --> 17:16.910
...feelings.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.780
-No.
-No. I can't go there.

17:18.869 --> 17:22.869
No, you see, Jacob and I
have a successful business relationship.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.000
Who's Jacob?

17:24.079 --> 17:26.329
The farmer who's supplying yams
for my lube.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.380
Farmer? Really?

17:28.460 --> 17:31.590
All that early to bed and
early to rise shit and actual shit?

17:31.670 --> 17:34.340
They named the worst tan after them
for a reason.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.140
No, he's actually a great guy

17:37.220 --> 17:39.930
and I'm pretty sure he wants me to be
his one and only.

17:40.010 --> 17:43.680
-And the problem is?
-I'm not ready for a big romance.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.560
Well, who has time for that?

17:45.640 --> 17:48.350
Yeah, it kind of makes me want to
take a nap just thinking about it.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.940
Right. So what do I do?

17:50.020 --> 17:54.280
I don't want to lose the friendship.
And I love the flirtation.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.570
So what's between
business-colleagues-with-chemistry

17:57.660 --> 17:59.410
and a big romance?

17:59.490 --> 18:00.490
Sex.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.410
Well, what's between
business-colleagues-with-chemistry

18:03.500 --> 18:05.410
-and sex?
-Occasional sex.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.420
Well, what's between
business-colleagues-with-chemistry and--

18:08.500 --> 18:11.840
Honey, if somebody wants something more
in a relationship,

18:11.920 --> 18:16.010
eventually it's going to involve sex.

18:16.090 --> 18:18.840
And if you want to stay
his one and only...

18:20.850 --> 18:24.060
Just remember, don't bite your nails,
no eye-rolling,

18:24.140 --> 18:27.060
and try not to look like you want
to punch anybody, OK, Billie?

18:27.190 --> 18:28.310
Call me back.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.110
You're washing the dishes!
With fresh water.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.940
Oh, is this a housekeeping mirage?

18:36.030 --> 18:38.740
I'm upset.
Sometimes I clean when I'm upset.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.370
-Since when?
-It's new.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.330
-What's the matter?
-Jacob wants sex.

18:45.410 --> 18:47.830
With me. In the vagina.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.580
Did he make a pass at you?

18:49.670 --> 18:53.550
No. Amanda and Jason made a pass at me
on his behalf.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.630
How does that even work?

18:55.710 --> 18:58.010
I don't want a boyfriend!

18:58.090 --> 19:00.180
I have to say,
it seems like that's where you and Jacob

19:00.260 --> 19:01.680
have been going this whole time.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.220
I know, I know.
And I like him, too, but--

19:04.310 --> 19:06.140
That doesn't clean that.

19:06.220 --> 19:09.560
I mean, I don't understand.
Things were going so great with Jacob.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.860
Well, Grace,
excitement has transmogrified,

19:11.940 --> 19:14.320
as it always does, into fear.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.570
That is definitely not
what you clean that with.

19:17.650 --> 19:23.490
I have to do something. I can't just sit
on the slope and slide into love oblivion.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.870
-Why not?
-How are you not following this, lady?

19:26.950 --> 19:28.830
Look what happened to you and Phil.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.170
You know what? This is not about
me and Phil. This is about you.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.760
Maybe I'm not as strong as you.
I can't do it.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.720
I cannot go through that again.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.140
Define "that."

19:44.300 --> 19:45.470
Heartbreak.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.520
Well, what's between heartbreak
and where you are now?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.980
Oh, this game again.

19:50.060 --> 19:52.480
You know, sometimes things do work out.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.690
When did you become the optimist
in this relationship?

19:55.770 --> 20:00.240
Tuesday. Next time you get upset,
try getting upset in the bathroom.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.070
It's filthy.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.370
Mallory? Everything all right?

20:05.450 --> 20:08.120
<i>Yeah. Sorry, Dad,</i>
<i>two babies dancing on my bladder.</i>

20:08.200 --> 20:10.330
That's sweet.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.580
<i>OK, Dad, not so much salt.</i>

20:13.210 --> 20:14.380
<i>You know what, never mind,</i>

20:14.460 --> 20:16.090
<i>you're not gonna eat</i>
<i>the chicken skin anyway. It's fine.</i>

20:16.170 --> 20:19.300
God, no. Crispy chicken skin's
the absolute worst.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.550
Voilà.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.760
<i>OK, now we're gonna put it in the oven.</i>

20:22.840 --> 20:23.890
<i>It's already pre-heated</i>
<i>so you're good to go.</i>

20:23.970 --> 20:27.850
Chicken is going in the pre-heated oven.

20:27.930 --> 20:28.970
Done.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.350
<i>-Potatoes.</i>
-Potatoes.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.480
<i>So we're going to use the water that</i>
<i>the potatoes cooked in instead of milk,</i>

20:35.560 --> 20:38.400
and then we're gonna use half the stick
of butter that Ina Garten suggests.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.110
<i>Butter. Yes.</i>
<i>Where did I put that butter? Excuse me.</i>

20:42.200 --> 20:44.240
-Dad.
<i>-Oh, sorry.</i>

20:44.320 --> 20:46.240
<i>Dad, did you just put</i>
<i>the whole stick of butter in?</i>

20:46.320 --> 20:49.910
It slipped through my fingers, but, hey,
if it's good enough for Ida Baddadudda,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.450
it's good enough for me.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.750
Ugh. My mom's Eliza Doolittle
still hasn't shown up,

20:57.840 --> 20:59.710
but she's in the lobby
and she wants to say hi.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.630
That's great.
We can tell your mom about us.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.800
What is this weird obsession you have
with telling people things?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.930
Your mom hired me. She already likes me.

21:08.010 --> 21:10.060
Come on, let's rip off the Band-Aid.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.140
Look, please? You don't even
have to scream into a hallway.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.520
Fine, Tattles. Go ahead and rip.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.020
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.230
How'd it go? Mmm! Where is she?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.530
I don't know, Mom.
Your protégée is 15 minutes late.

21:25.070 --> 21:28.740
Oh. Well, she's probably

21:28.830 --> 21:30.950
having car trouble or something.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.080
-Hm.
-Try to be patient with her, honey.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.120
She's a... little rough around the edges.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.630
But she has a lot of potential.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.500
She reminds me a little bit of you.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.210
You know, she's feisty.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.630
Mom, that's almost not an insult.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.510
Well, this was a good excuse
to stop by the new office.

21:47.590 --> 21:51.180
Very nice. Is this why
you couldn't hire me back?

21:51.260 --> 21:53.430
You spent all your money on windows?

21:53.520 --> 21:56.560
And how is
my favorite former intern?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.560
Oh, so good. Can I just say,

21:58.650 --> 22:01.190
you not paying me was probably the
best thing that's ever happened to me.

22:01.270 --> 22:03.690
I still can't believe I didn't know
you moved in with Eric.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.740
Well, this is what happens
when you skip SoulCycle.

22:05.820 --> 22:09.620
Hi, Grace. It is so good to see you again.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.490
Oh, God.

22:14.790 --> 22:19.000
It's me, Barry. Uh, you hired me
from Burt's Bees. The accountant.

22:20.210 --> 22:23.630
I got you the iPod nano
for Secret Santa and...

22:24.880 --> 22:26.880
I-- The toaster oven.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.470
It caught on fire when my bagel
went in it and set off the sprinklers.

22:29.550 --> 22:32.560
Oh, God. That was-- That was you?

22:32.640 --> 22:35.020
Yeah.
I thought we fired that guy.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.730
OK, this has been a blast,
but I have some meetings, Mom,

22:37.810 --> 22:39.400
-so maybe you should call Billie.
-Come on.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.560
You can use my office
slash cubicle slash prison.

22:41.650 --> 22:42.940
-OK. Bye, honey.
-Bye.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.360
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.860
Bye, you.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.330
You're right. Let's just--
We'll never tell her.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.200
Told you.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.660
I was fired?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.790
Billie? It's Grace, where are you?

22:57.870 --> 22:58.920
What--

22:59.920 --> 23:01.460
She hung up on me!

23:01.540 --> 23:04.170
Ew. Call her back and hang up on her.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.590
-Here, I'll do it.
-Oh.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.800
What the fuck happened? Where were you?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.850
- I have a job.
- That's it?

23:12.930 --> 23:14.180
No apology?

23:14.260 --> 23:17.480
Do you realize how unbelievably
inconsiderate it is to not show up?

23:17.560 --> 23:19.850
No, I got up this morning,
I put on that stupid shirt,

23:19.940 --> 23:22.230
and I listened to all your messages
reminding me of what to say

23:22.310 --> 23:23.820
and how to smile and I just--

23:23.900 --> 23:26.190
Ever since you started helping me,

23:26.280 --> 23:29.030
I just feel dumb, and ugly,
and uncomfortable,

23:29.110 --> 23:30.610
and like everything
that I'm doing is wrong.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.330
You do not get me at all.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.910
OK? You have no idea
how hard I've had it.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.910
-'Cause I've had it so easy?
-Haven't you, Miss Beach House?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.580
Listen to me, missy.

23:41.670 --> 23:45.670
I have worked since I was 15,
and the only reason I stopped

23:45.750 --> 23:48.590
was because I retired
from a business that I built.

23:48.670 --> 23:52.220
You've had it so hard?
Try being a woman in her 70s.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.800
Talk about being invisible.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.600
People act like you don't know anything,
that you don't count.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.770
Well, screw that, and screw you!

23:59.850 --> 24:01.230
Screw you, too!

24:01.310 --> 24:03.480
I don't know why I thought
I could ever help you.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.190
You know, I don't know how either.

24:05.270 --> 24:08.900
All this, this is too much pressure
for one person.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.780
OK? I think you need to focus all that
energy and instead of finding me a job,

24:11.860 --> 24:13.240
go find yourself one.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.010
Hey.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.970
I just dropped off some seed catalogs.
Text me the varieties you want,

24:39.060 --> 24:41.770
but do it sooner than later
if you want to have them this season.

24:41.850 --> 24:44.650
OK, thanks.
Hey, would you like some tea?

24:44.730 --> 24:47.440
-No.
-Uh, wait. Don't go, Jacob.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.990
I-- I like you. I really do.
I was-- I could-- I'm open to it.

24:52.070 --> 24:54.610
I could see us apple picking
in the fall

24:54.700 --> 24:57.080
or pumpkin picking in the... fall.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.830
They both grow-- weird--
in the same season.

24:59.910 --> 25:02.040
Just-- Mm...

25:10.420 --> 25:14.840
Did you just stop your own ramble...
by kissing me?

25:14.930 --> 25:18.930
It appears that way. I--
Mmm.

25:19.010 --> 25:22.140
I real-- I do like you.
I'm-I'm-I'm scared.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.850
I'm not able to-- I mean, I want to.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.610
I'm-- I cannot see anything
more than going--

25:28.690 --> 25:30.520
-Taking things slow.
-I can do slow.

25:30.610 --> 25:34.400
I mean really slow. Like, I mean,
if we go apple and/or pumpkin picking,

25:34.490 --> 25:36.990
and we go to dinner alone, would--
I mean, do you--

25:37.070 --> 25:40.580
Do you think you can hold back
your desire for me?

25:40.660 --> 25:42.580
I'll do my best.

25:54.130 --> 25:58.180
Make me a martini. Vodka. Very dry.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.970
Two olives.

26:00.050 --> 26:03.890
No, no, no, I said very dry.
That's way too much vermouth.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.850
What are you gonna do,
serve it in a cauldron?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.520
Who's the bartender here?

26:08.650 --> 26:11.400
Sorry. You're right.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.530
-I do need to find something to do.
-Right? I should be the mentor.

26:16.610 --> 26:19.030
You know mentors do it
out of the goodness of their heart.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.870
-You don't get paid.
-Well, then I should keep doing this.

26:23.660 --> 26:27.790
Look, I know I'm a lousy mentor, but
can I give you one last piece of advice?

26:27.870 --> 26:29.460
No, thank you.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.250
You can't get anywhere in life
if you keep pushing people away.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.510
I don't fucking push people away.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.220
OK.

26:44.850 --> 26:46.810
Wow. That's a good martini.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.400
You're actually a good bartender.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.860
What is that? Cinnamon?

26:51.940 --> 26:53.820
-Nope.
-Peppermint?

26:53.900 --> 26:57.200
-Guess again.
-Come on, what's the secret?

26:57.280 --> 26:59.490
I don't clean the shaker
when I make a drink.

26:59.570 --> 27:00.820
Puts a nice stank on it.

27:04.330 --> 27:06.950
Oh. Stank.

27:15.210 --> 27:16.920
Hello, stranger.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.470
What?

27:21.510 --> 27:22.760
What's all this?

27:22.850 --> 27:25.810
Just thought I'd class up the joint.

27:27.560 --> 27:31.770
Oh, my God, this is the London suit.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.650
-It still fits?
-Still fits.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.730
Of course, I had the buttons moved,
all the seams taken out,

27:36.820 --> 27:39.700
and a new panel sewn in the back
to make it fit.

27:41.030 --> 27:44.330
You look even better
than the first time you wore it.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.750
-The first time--
-I said I love you.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.040
I know.

27:50.580 --> 27:52.250
Come on, love.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.280
You did all this?

28:20.030 --> 28:23.320
Is that why
you wanted me out of the house today?

28:24.870 --> 28:29.370
We're married now
and your traditions are my traditions.

28:29.450 --> 28:32.710
I know you've been killing yourself
taking care of me,

28:32.790 --> 28:35.710
but all of the worrying
and the sickness is over.

28:35.790 --> 28:38.920
We got through it. So, mazel tov.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.550
And I'm hoping that from now on,
every Friday night,

28:44.640 --> 28:46.510
we'll be here, together...

28:47.510 --> 28:49.140
doing this.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.310
Or maybe going out someplace.

28:56.940 --> 29:01.240
<i>♪ Barukh atah Adonai ♪</i>

29:01.320 --> 29:03.950

29:06.370 --> 29:11.500

- Please.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.080
Please, Robert, just stop.

29:16.170 --> 29:18.500
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm doing it wrong.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.840
See, I got it off the Internet
and maybe the phonetics are--

29:20.920 --> 29:23.720
I need you to stay calm, OK?

29:25.300 --> 29:26.680
OK.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.730
The day we packed up our house,

29:33.810 --> 29:35.520
I slept with Frankie.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.400
It was an emotional day

29:38.480 --> 29:41.730
and it didn't mean anything
more than an ending.

29:41.820 --> 29:46.610
Even so, I wish to God
I could take it back.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.410
I was going to tell you,

29:49.490 --> 29:51.620
but then you had the attack...

30:05.130 --> 30:06.550
So...

30:09.010 --> 30:11.930
when you married me
in the hospital...

30:13.100 --> 30:15.520
I was so worried about you.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.020
I didn't want to make things worse.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.160
Please...

30:31.490 --> 30:33.370
say something.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.550
Get out.
