09:19.036 --> 09:20.734
- Okay, that's impossible.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.605
I've been using this moisturizer

09:22.736 --> 09:24.999
every day for 3 months.
- Oh.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.567
- Although, this is a new
batch.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.874
And we've already sold half
the stock. Oh my god!

09:31.005 --> 09:32.789
- See? I knew it!

09:32.920 --> 09:35.531
David, we have a problem.
We have a big problem.

09:35.662 --> 09:36.880
You could be sued!

09:37.011 --> 09:38.578
- What?
- For retail negligence.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.796
Stevie, show him your arms
again.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.102
- I don't want to show him
my arms.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.582
- I don't wanna see
her arms again.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.584
- You realize you're gonna have
to talk to Patrick

09:44.714 --> 09:46.847
and tell him that you two
are gonna have to take a bit

09:46.977 --> 09:48.805
of a breather when it comes
to...
- Ew!

09:48.936 --> 09:50.502
- You know, could be
contagious.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.157
- Oh my god!
- Yeah, and here you were
this morning,

09:53.288 --> 09:55.595
acting like you were doing us
a favour with the rollout.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.771
- Okay, this is one of our
best-selling products.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.990
- Well, we're gonna have
to roll it back in.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.949
And stop touching your face!

10:02.079 --> 10:03.907
- You stop touching your face!

10:05.430 --> 10:07.389
Alexis: Okay, this is
definitely smaller

10:07.519 --> 10:08.433
than the curling rink.

10:09.696 --> 10:09.957
- Well, it sounds like you've
been really busy

10:11.001 --> 10:12.089
puttin' this thing together.
- Yeah.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.961
What's happened since you
and Tallahassee

10:14.091 --> 10:16.311
left on your pine-cone journey?

10:16.441 --> 10:19.183
- It's uh, Tennessee, and I'm
pretty sure you know that,

10:19.314 --> 10:22.970
and that ended a while ago.
- Oh no!

10:23.013 --> 10:26.147
I totally thought she
was like, the one for you.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.540
- We called it off the day
we arrived.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.978
She's married to Moonshine now,
the owner of the cone form.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.762
- I'm sorry to hear that.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.546
- That trip was a disaster.

10:34.677 --> 10:35.896
Compass broke halfway there,

10:36.026 --> 10:37.549
we ended up following
a star for 2 days.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.987
Anyway, by the time we got
there, we sat down

10:40.117 --> 10:42.380
and uh, spoke our truths.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.643
Pretty freeing.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
That day I picked 700 cones!

10:46.820 --> 10:49.126
- Hmm, is that like a lot
of cones?

10:49.257 --> 10:52.173
- Well, Moonshine
and his daughter, Petal,

10:52.303 --> 10:55.219
said it was the biggest one-day
haul they'd ever seen.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.047
They gave me the Cone
of Achievement,

10:57.178 --> 10:58.919
which allowed me to take
2 showers that week.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.703
[Thunder rolls]

11:00.834 --> 11:03.053
- Speaking of showers,
- Ugh! No!

11:03.184 --> 11:04.489
This can't happen,

11:04.620 --> 11:07.231
I have like 50 zillion
things to do today.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.451
- Ooh, well, if only helping me
clean was one of 'em.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.322
- Ugh!

11:12.019 --> 11:14.325
- I can crack open a bottle
of cone wine?

11:14.456 --> 11:16.023
Feeling risky?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.677
- Ugh, fine. Um, no.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.593
Uh... fine. No.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.380
Okay, but um, like just one.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.297
[Pours cone wine]

11:30.472 --> 11:32.430
- Welcome to jury selection.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.563
The case you would be asked
to decide

11:34.694 --> 11:37.261
is a misdemeanor embezzlement
charge

11:37.392 --> 11:41.831
levied by the owners of Tom
and Marge's Magic and Fun Shop,

11:41.962 --> 11:45.400
against their business manager,
Mr. Albert Percy.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.576
- Embezzlement, no, no, no, no.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.273
I've seen this movie before.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.102
- It is your responsibility
to notify the court

11:52.233 --> 11:54.626
of anything you've seen
or heard,

11:54.757 --> 11:56.803
that may impact on your ability

11:56.933 --> 11:59.762
to be a fair
and impartial juror.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.330
- Moira, this sounds like what
happened to your family.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.115
This could be your out.
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

12:05.246 --> 12:07.814
A man needs to be brought
to justice.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.293
- Yeah.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.430
- So we're back
to the generic brand.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.736
[Door opens]
Roland: Well gang,

12:16.866 --> 12:19.042
just about time
for me to clock out.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.565
I gotta tell you two,

12:20.696 --> 12:22.829
this timesheet you have
is really complicated.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.613
By the time I finished filling
it out,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.746
I was already into overtime.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.878
So do you guys have an overtime
sheet I can fill out?

12:29.009 --> 12:31.272
- Kinda busy in here, Roland.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.709
- Whoa. Stevie! Geez! Yowzer!

12:35.755 --> 12:37.974
- It's just a reaction
to David's moisturizer.

12:38.105 --> 12:41.761
- Well, boy, leave it to Stevie
to get a rash

12:41.891 --> 12:43.763
from a moisturizer when
she's sitting right

12:43.893 --> 12:46.940
next to poison oak.
- What poison oak?

12:47.070 --> 12:48.332
- Excuse me?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.160
- Well, right here. It's uh...

12:50.291 --> 12:52.946
poison oak in that vase there.
- What?

12:53.076 --> 12:55.949
- Where did you get those
flowers, Mr. Rose?

12:56.079 --> 12:59.779
- Well, I talked to a few
florists, and then I...

12:59.909 --> 13:03.304
decided it was more authentic
and... economical,

13:03.434 --> 13:06.698
if I just went out back and...
picked some.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.310
- Uh, correct me if I'm wrong
here, Johnny,

13:09.440 --> 13:12.792
but I don't think poison oak
is that expensive.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.924
- I didn't know
it was poison oak!

13:15.055 --> 13:16.491
- Mhmm.
- Wait a second,

13:16.621 --> 13:18.754
if you picked them, then how
come you don't have the rash?

13:18.885 --> 13:20.800
- Well, I was wearing
gardening gloves.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.976
- Okay, look, I'd love to stand
around and help you guys,

13:23.106 --> 13:25.892
but I'm already sneaking
into double overtime here, so,

13:26.022 --> 13:27.763
I'm off.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.722
- So... someone's gonna have
to tell David before he...

13:30.853 --> 13:33.073
takes it all back.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.597
- No offence, Mr. Rose,
but I'm pretty sure

13:35.727 --> 13:38.992
that someone is not
going to be me.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.428
[Taps on bottle]

13:41.559 --> 13:43.779
- Ma'am, can you assure my
client and the Court,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.694
that you would, to the best
of your ability,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.131
uphold the law if selected
for jury duty?

13:48.262 --> 13:50.133
- Affirmative. Mhmm.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.266
- Do you have any life
experiences similar

13:52.396 --> 13:53.615
to the facts of this case,

13:53.745 --> 13:55.965
that might affect your judgment?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.841
- Well, there was that summer
that Jimmy Smits

14:01.971 --> 14:04.495
stole my heart on stage in
a workshop-only production

14:04.626 --> 14:06.106
of "An Officer and
a Gentleman".

14:06.236 --> 14:08.891
I suppose that might be called
emotional embezzlement?

14:09.022 --> 14:12.155
- So your answer is no.
- To what?

14:12.286 --> 14:15.942
- Juror 75, you were asked if
you had any personal conflicts

14:16.072 --> 14:18.988
that might affect your
judgments of this case.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.556
- I don't know these people.
I don't know these people.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.951
The fact that my own world
was ripped out from under me,

14:25.081 --> 14:27.910
by someone like this prick
of a prestidigitator?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.826
I should think would help
the court in the quest

14:30.957 --> 14:34.177
to make a fair judgment.
[Crowd murmurs]

14:34.308 --> 14:36.353
May I approach the bench,
please?

14:36.484 --> 14:37.877
- No, you may not.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.932
- Jocelyn, for the sake
of that woman,

14:50.063 --> 14:51.934
you must push for the maximum
sentence!

14:52.065 --> 14:53.675
- Your Honour!
- Hold on.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.329
You two know each other?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.505
- Not really, we just got
to talking on the way in.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.463
I... I wouldn't say
we were close.

14:59.594 --> 15:04.207
- All right, I'm dismissing
both Juror 75 and Juror 23.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.861
- Mother fucker.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.516
This is the farthest
I've ever gone!

15:08.646 --> 15:10.822
[Rain patters]

15:10.953 --> 15:13.260
- It sounds like it's actually
raining harder.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.785
- So just take the day off,
like old time's sake.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.919
- Um, I am a college graduate,
Mutt.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.921
Singles Week is not community
service,

15:22.051 --> 15:24.401
it's actually very important
to me.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.273
- And I respect that.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.667
So, will you be participating
in Singles Week?

15:29.798 --> 15:31.495
- Ugh. No, I'm trying to like,

15:31.626 --> 15:35.499
learn from my mistakes
before making any new ones.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.633
- Think it's funny,
you bringing people together,

15:38.763 --> 15:42.071
and, here we are, still single.
- Hmm.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.508
- Makes you wonder if it's us?
- [Alexis laughs]

15:48.077 --> 15:50.297
What is happening?
- I don't know,

15:50.427 --> 15:52.560
I just thought we were here,
it's raining,

15:52.690 --> 15:54.431
felt like nothing had changed.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.999
- Yeah, I can see how you
would make that leap,

15:57.130 --> 16:00.568
but things have changed for me.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.224
- That's cool.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.705
We did have some fun in here,
though.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.578
- Yeah, we did.

16:10.708 --> 16:14.190
- You were quite
the heartbreaker.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.149
- Yeah.

16:16.279 --> 16:21.067
Not like, super proud
of that, but...

16:21.197 --> 16:23.417
Um, so when you and Tallahassee
had your talk,

16:23.547 --> 16:26.159
you said it was freeing.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.900
- Saying something you've kept
hidden, out loud?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.946
Yeah, it was pretty freeing.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.426
Though, in our case,
it was mostly swears

16:34.036 --> 16:35.168
and we didn't talk for a week,
but it was worth it in the end.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.605
Who knows where I'd be right
now if I just

16:37.735 --> 16:40.086
didn't tell her how I felt.
Hmm.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.004
- Yeah.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.354
I think I need to leave.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.313
- It's still raining!

16:50.444 --> 16:52.098
- Yeah, I know, I know,
there's um,

16:52.228 --> 16:54.448
there's like something
I need to do.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.971
But thank you for the talk,

16:56.102 --> 16:57.146

to tell you, Brenda, I'm rashy!

Yeah, the batch must be
contaminated or something,

17:21.083 --> 17:23.346
it's like, some,
some cream-borne virus!

17:25.435 --> 17:27.046
Yes, it's the cream.

with the vendor

17:45.412 --> 17:48.241
that sold us the infectious
moisturizer, so...

17:48.371 --> 17:51.113

a sense of humour,

17:54.290 --> 17:56.423

17:56.553 --> 17:59.034
about you know, the rash?

17:59.165 --> 18:02.429
Well, it turns out it wasn't
the moisturizer,

18:02.559 --> 18:04.605
it was poison oak.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.574
- You know, it seems poison oak
accidentally

18:17.705 --> 18:21.056
found its way into the floral
arrangements at the motel.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.493
- How did that happen?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.539
- I don't know.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.324
I don't know how it happened.
I think someone,

someone must've thought it
was a beautiful plant.

didn't you?

18:33.808 --> 18:35.636

it was a pretty flower,

your whole face in it!

my nose to a flower!

of Ebola!

And don't worry, I'll be
vetting everyone in advance.

[Chuckles]

19:18.635 --> 19:20.681
[Light tap]

19:20.811 --> 19:23.162
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.033
How long have you been
standing there?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.166
- Um, long enough.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.691
- Yeah, I was just giving them
a little pup talk.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.780
- [Alexis chuckles]

19:32.910 --> 19:35.174
Okay, Ted, I have a few things
to say,

19:35.304 --> 19:37.132
and I need you just to listen.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.134
- Okay, uh, is it about
the puppies though,

19:39.265 --> 19:40.962
just because they're kinda
fragile right now,

19:41.092 --> 19:42.616
so maybe we should go
in the other room.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.619
- It's not about the puppies.
- Oh, okay, good.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.490
- Okay. So as you know,

19:49.927 --> 19:52.800
Singles Week has been taking up
a lot of my time, um,

19:52.930 --> 19:55.629
because this could be like, a
big step forward in my career,

19:55.759 --> 19:56.978
and generally speaking,

19:57.108 --> 19:58.980
this is like a very cute
look for me.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.461
- Okay.
- Okay... not finished yet.

20:01.591 --> 20:05.726
The problem is,
I've been having um,

20:05.769 --> 20:08.424
a hard time focusing on this
exciting career opportunity

20:08.555 --> 20:11.210
because my mind has been
elsewhere.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.429
- Oh, I just assumed that's
how you always work.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.518
- Thank you, Ted,
but this is different.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
I love you.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.873
I'm in love with you.

20:23.004 --> 20:26.399
And, I know I really don't have
any right to say that to you.

20:26.529 --> 20:30.098
And also, I know you're
in a relationship, um,

20:30.229 --> 20:31.708
and I'm happy for you,
I really am,

20:31.839 --> 20:34.058
I just feel like if I didn't
tell you how I felt,

20:34.189 --> 20:36.104
I would literally go insane.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.674
You're the sweetest man
I've ever known.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.507
And... that's it.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.862
- Wow, I didn't...
I don't know what to say.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.473
- You don't have to say
anything.

20:57.604 --> 21:01.912
Um, but maybe I could take
a puppy home for the night.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.479
- You know I can't let you
do that.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.438
- Yeah, no. That's no problem.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.135
Um, I was just thinking
if there was like,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.311
a particularly runty one,
like Cindy,

21:09.442 --> 21:12.662
or like, no, no.
That's okay. [Sighs]

21:12.793 --> 21:16.144
Okay, well, this is going to be
a very successful event.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.451
Like, really great.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.844
Okay.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.498
[Footsteps thud]

21:22.629 --> 21:25.414
