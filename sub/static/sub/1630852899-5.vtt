00:10.358 --> 00:11.054
Previously onFrom...

00:11.185 --> 00:12.229
I hear their voices.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.666
They said it was
the only way to go home.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.407
Sara, just tell me
what you did.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.322
I left the door open.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.456
Are you living in town
or Colony House?

00:21.586 --> 00:22.848
-Town.
-Julie.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.415
Colony House.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.547
Why are you doing this?

00:25.677 --> 00:26.765
What's wrong?

00:26.896 --> 00:29.986
I think maybe
I-I made a mistake.

00:30.117 --> 00:33.903
Julie, there are
no mistakes, just choices,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.818
and you chose what was right
for you, and that matters.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.602
Come on,
try it out!

00:37.733 --> 00:39.430
Every single one
of these pins

00:39.561 --> 00:40.910
is a different resident
who drove in

00:41.041 --> 00:42.477
from a different location.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.567
That is fucking impossible.

00:45.697 --> 00:49.571
I don't just sit around,
accepting the world as it is!

00:49.701 --> 00:51.703
-Someone is doing this,

00:51.834 --> 00:53.488
and I'm not gonna rest
until I figure out how!

00:53.618 --> 00:54.880
I wish you had
the luxury of grief,

00:55.011 --> 00:56.534
but you don't, Boyd.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.928
These people need you.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.800
You need to be the one
to lead these people home.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.151
'Cause if you don't?
She died for nothing.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.936
What are you doing here?
You promised you'd stay home.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.633
If I didn't show up,
they would have wondered why.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.374
-It'll be okay.
-Sara...

01:10.505 --> 01:11.984
I promise.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.856
Do you wanna help me bring
over the rest of the food?

01:13.986 --> 01:15.379
Yeah!

01:16.641 --> 01:20.036
I just feel so... broken.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.386
We're gonna figure it
out together.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.735
Don't worry.

01:23.866 --> 01:24.736
Whatcha got there?

01:24.867 --> 01:25.868
Sweet potatoes.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.391
Ooh!

01:27.522 --> 01:30.438
Nice family.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.887
Sara!

01:45.017 --> 01:46.193
Hey.
Oh! Oh, no, no, no.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.803
Okay, grab her,
grab her arm, grab her arm!

01:47.933 --> 01:49.413
Hold on, hold on!

01:58.596 --> 02:01.643
Hey, Alma. Come on.

02:01.773 --> 02:05.690
There you go, Alma,
a fresh batch just for you.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.693
Hey!
Make sure you share this time.

02:08.824 --> 02:12.567
Nathan! Nathan!

02:12.697 --> 02:15.570
It's your sister!
Something happened at the diner.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.832
They're taking her
to the clinic.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.842
I really am feeling much better.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.627
I still think you should spend
the night for observation, okay?

02:29.758 --> 02:30.846
Do I have to?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.108
It's just,
with things like this,

02:32.239 --> 02:35.111
it's best not to
take any chances, you know?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.678
I can have someone
go get Nathan.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.593
He can stay with you.

02:38.723 --> 02:42.771
No. He worries.
If he comes by,

02:42.901 --> 02:46.557
could you...
just tell him I'm sleeping.

02:46.688 --> 02:47.732
Yeah, no problem.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.871
I'll, uh--
I'll be right back, okay?

03:05.185 --> 03:08.100
Hey. How's she doing?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.015
I mean, fine,
given the circumstances.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.149
Has this happened before?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.717
Well, I mean,
not according to Sara.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.849
And unless there's an MRI
machine tucked around somewhere,

03:17.980 --> 03:19.721
there's no way to really
know what's going on.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.418
-Yeah.
-I'm, uh...

03:21.549 --> 03:23.681
I'm gonna keep her overnight
and see if anything changes.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.031
Okay. You sure you're ready
for that?

03:26.162 --> 03:28.077
Look, I don't know
how that door got open,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.992
but I'm not gonna
let those things

03:30.122 --> 03:31.994
take this place
away from me.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.865
They've already taken
too much already.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.129
Yeah. They sure have.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.784
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

03:39.915 --> 03:43.788
These seizures - first,
the Matthews kid, now Sara.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.137
You think it's possible

03:45.268 --> 03:47.227
to have a physical
reaction to this place?

03:47.357 --> 03:50.186
Maybe something you
might normally diagnose

03:50.317 --> 03:52.057
as one thing on the outside,
but here it's--

03:52.188 --> 03:55.060
Look, Boyd, if you asked me
this six months ago,

03:55.191 --> 03:57.106
I would have said anything that
we've seen here was impossible.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.761
But the truth is, I...

03:59.891 --> 04:03.591
Okay, how long has
this been going on for?

04:05.897 --> 04:08.030
Long enough that it's got me
asking stupid questions.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.988
-Boyd...
-I'm fine.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.817
Come by tomorrow.
I want to take a look at it.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.602
No need.
I already know what it is.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.997
Nathan's here.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.521
She doesn't want to see him.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.959
Yeah, I don't-- I don't know.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.006
Um, okay.
Go take care of your patient.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.834
I got this, okay?

04:29.965 --> 04:32.924
And I'm good.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

04:35.318 --> 04:36.711
Is she okay?

04:36.841 --> 04:38.495
She's fine.
She's sleeping.

04:40.062 --> 04:42.151
I wanna see her.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.196
And you will, tomorrow.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.850
Kristi's gonna sit
with her tonight

04:45.981 --> 04:47.025
and make sure
everything is okay.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.766
No, no. I-I need
to see her now, please.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.464
You will. Hey, hey.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.901
Is there anything else going on
that we should know about?

04:53.031 --> 04:56.731
Anything that might help Kristi
figure out what's wrong?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.863
No. I'm just worried,
that's all.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.083
She's my little sister.

05:01.213 --> 05:05.783
Right. Look,

05:05.914 --> 05:09.787
this is Kristi's first
night back since... right?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.354
We don't want
to be going in there

05:11.485 --> 05:14.705
and making tonight more
stressful than it already is.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.794
Sara's in good hands.
Okay?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.144
Go home.
Get some sleep.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.798
You'll see her in the morning.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.191
Yeah.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.801
Okay?

05:40.035 --> 05:44.126
Is Sara gonna be okay?

05:44.256 --> 05:46.171
Well, yeah,
she's down at the clinic.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.738
They're gonna take
good care of her. Don't worry.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.349
You remember Kristi?

05:49.479 --> 05:52.395
The nice lady
who took care of your leg?

05:52.526 --> 05:55.703
She's gonna patch up Sara
the same way she patched you up.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.010
In the meantime,

05:59.141 --> 06:01.622
we are gonna
play a little game.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.842
For you.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.801
Well, we said we're gonna
figure it out, right?

06:06.931 --> 06:09.020
Let's figure it out.
Follow me.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.290
We're gonna do some
problem-solving,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.031
and the way
you problem solve

06:20.162 --> 06:21.816
is by asking questions.

06:21.946 --> 06:25.036
You ask every question
that might apply,

06:25.167 --> 06:27.299
no matter how crazy,
no matter how unlikely.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.041
You put it up on a board,
you get it out in front of you

06:30.172 --> 06:31.956
so that you can identify
everything you know

06:32.087 --> 06:34.089
and everything you don't.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.005
It'll be like telling
a story.

06:37.135 --> 06:40.748
Right, buddy?
Question number one.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.882
Dad!

06:45.013 --> 06:47.668
What? You never wanted
to write on a wall?

06:57.242 --> 07:01.159
There.
That's where we begin.

07:01.290 --> 07:11.213
♪

07:21.353 --> 07:26.489
♪

08:28.159 --> 08:30.466
"Will I be pretty?"♪

09:47.151 --> 09:48.065
Hey.

09:50.198 --> 09:53.114
I can't sleep.

09:53.244 --> 09:56.944
Uh, yeah, me neither.
I thought you'd like some tea?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.815
Do you want some?

10:01.035 --> 10:01.992
Sure.

10:09.565 --> 10:12.220
You and Kenny make
a really cute couple.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.396
Oh, uh, no,
we're just--

10:14.526 --> 10:15.876
we're just friends.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.573
Why?

10:17.704 --> 10:21.011
He's really sweet,
and he loves you.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.492
It's complicated.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.276
How?

10:25.407 --> 10:28.323
Well, 'cause I...

10:28.453 --> 10:31.456
...have somebody at home.

10:31.587 --> 10:35.417
At least I think she's...
still... waiting.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.420
What's her name?

10:40.030 --> 10:42.206
Mariel.

10:42.337 --> 10:45.253
-Were you married?
-Engaged.

10:45.383 --> 10:49.518
I wonder sometimes,
actually all the time, uh,

10:49.649 --> 10:54.175
what it must be like for her,
thinking I, uh, abandoned her.

10:54.305 --> 10:57.091
Um, how about you?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.528
Do you have
anybody back at home?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.486
No.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.011
I... I was with someone,

11:04.141 --> 11:08.319
but he wasn't...

11:08.450 --> 11:13.107
It's better that
he's not around anymore.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.545
It's just me and Nathan now.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.592
He's all
I've got in the world.

11:20.723 --> 11:24.292
Before we got
stuck here, I, um...

11:24.422 --> 11:28.383
Things weren't
really very good for me.

11:28.513 --> 11:31.038
Nathan was
the one who saved me.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.042
Can I ask you something?

11:35.172 --> 11:37.609
Yeah. Sure.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.396
If there was
something you could do,

11:41.526 --> 11:46.183
something that would
let you see Mariel again...

11:47.707 --> 11:51.449
something that would let
everyone here go home,

11:51.580 --> 11:55.018
even if it was something bad,

11:55.149 --> 11:56.585
would you do it?

11:57.325 --> 11:59.762
Wait,
what are you talking about?

11:59.893 --> 12:04.636
I wonder sometimes...
about this place,

12:04.767 --> 12:08.075
what it means...

12:08.205 --> 12:10.120
why we're here.

12:11.643 --> 12:15.256
If someone came up to you
right now and said,

12:15.386 --> 12:18.128
"Do this one bad thing

12:18.259 --> 12:22.089
and everyone
gets to go home,"

12:22.219 --> 12:24.221
would you do it?

12:24.352 --> 12:27.747
Well, we're...

12:27.877 --> 12:30.358
we're speaking
hypothetically, right?

12:30.488 --> 12:31.359
Yeah.

12:31.489 --> 12:32.360
Okay.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.578
Of course.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.232
Okay.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.494
Uh...

12:39.193 --> 12:42.674
I mean...

12:42.805 --> 12:45.242
Yeah, I'd, um...

12:45.373 --> 12:48.245
I'd do anything
to see her again and...

12:48.376 --> 12:49.769
And hey, I mean,

12:49.899 --> 12:51.727
if that meant everybody else
got to go home too,

12:51.858 --> 12:54.686
then, I think
that's a lot of good

12:54.817 --> 12:58.038
for one bad thing.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.998
Yeah.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.268
Hmm.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.229
Tell me you
figured it out.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.318
Oh, I-I did.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.581
And the answer is 12.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.758
Okay.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.543
All right,
let's go over this again.

13:28.546 --> 13:32.463
Everyone enters from different
parts of the country,

13:32.594 --> 13:34.901
on different roads,
in different places,

13:35.031 --> 13:37.251
and they all, presumably,
see the same tree,

13:37.381 --> 13:38.730
same crows.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.471
Jim, Jim...

13:40.602 --> 13:44.649
everyone here has asked the same
question over and over again.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.609
How does writing
them on the wall

13:47.739 --> 13:49.176
going to make
any difference?

13:49.306 --> 13:51.569
Because...

13:51.700 --> 13:54.094
There are plenty of things in
the world that don't make sense.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.399
Yeah.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.575
Something here
is missing.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.188
We just can't see it yet.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.450
But we will.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.496
Well, there's a question
we haven't asked.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.293
No.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.383
Why not?

14:23.079 --> 14:26.213
Because it's crazy.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.349
I don't want
to know the answer.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.271
You sure you're not hungry?
I was gonna make some oatmeal.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.794
I'm not really hungry.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.796
Thank you
for last night, though.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.234
It's been a long time
since I've had a girls' night.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.800
Yeah, uh, me too.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.629
I mean, hey, no need to wait
for a medical emergency

14:51.760 --> 14:54.458
if you ever wanna
do it again.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.461
Oh, your brother's back.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.508
Uh, he's very persistent.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.337
Yeah, he is.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.904
Are you-- are you
sure you're okay?

15:05.034 --> 15:07.689
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
He just-- he cares a lot.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.212
Yeah.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.387
I'll see you later.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.870
You're up bright
and early.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.350
Sara, we need
to talk.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.612
About what?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.833
I'm so sorry I worried you.
I didn't mean to.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.749
It's fine. I just need
to know what happened.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.534
I was just...

15:26.664 --> 15:29.319
I was standing
in the diner one minute

15:29.450 --> 15:30.712
and the next,
I was on the floor.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.801
I don't really remember
much other than that.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.716
Why are you suddenly acting
like everything's okay?

15:34.846 --> 15:35.673
I need to get
to the diner.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.284
Mrs. Liu is
gonna be worried.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.546
Sara!

15:38.676 --> 15:41.549
I'm okay, I promise.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.246
I love you so much.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.737
Knock, knock.
You awake in there?

15:55.867 --> 15:57.782
Yeah, come on in.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.350
Whatcha doing?

16:00.481 --> 16:01.569
I'm making a list.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.398
Of?

16:04.528 --> 16:05.877
All the people
that are probably

16:06.008 --> 16:07.531
wondering where
we are right now.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.011
Oh.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.882
I mean, it's gotta be
worse for them, right?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.842
Not knowing.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.452
Just...

16:18.760 --> 16:21.067
I made one too.

16:21.197 --> 16:24.592
Pretty sure everybody here
did at one time or another.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.380
Who's on yours?

16:31.686 --> 16:35.211
My grandparents
and my friends.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.259
Boyfriend?

16:39.389 --> 16:40.912
No.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.523
Girlfriend?

16:42.653 --> 16:46.831
No, there's
nobody like that.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.704
I guess that's a good thing
though, right?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.836
Just one less person sitting
around losing their minds,

16:51.967 --> 16:53.795
wondering where you are.

16:53.925 --> 16:56.711
Okay.
That's enough of that.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.540
We need some fun, stat.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.455
Get dressed and meet me
downstairs in five?

17:01.585 --> 17:02.804
Why?

17:02.934 --> 17:03.892
You'll see.

17:12.596 --> 17:13.641
Hey.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.599
Hey.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.602
No more work
this morning.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.691
She's, uh,
making the list.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.828
I think it's time we
show her the Brundles.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.660
Just a fucking idiot.
That's special relativity.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.792
Uh... Klein.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.795
Hardy's.
Klein. Hardy's.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.539
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.367
Where are you
going with that?

17:46.674 --> 17:48.371
Sorry?

17:48.502 --> 17:50.721
Is that a radio?

17:50.852 --> 17:54.638
Uh... yeah.
Sort of.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.598
Why are you carrying it around?

17:58.947 --> 18:02.429
Because it helps me think.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.995
I'm sorry, I--

18:04.126 --> 18:05.736
You're even cuter
when you're awake.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.521
Excuse me?

18:07.651 --> 18:09.653
I watched you when
you were sleeping.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.959
I'm Trudy.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.875
Okay.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.833
Too bad you chose the town.

18:18.749 --> 18:22.318
I would've rode you
like an alabaster dragon.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.582
Bye!

18:41.903 --> 18:43.513
Morning, Sheriff.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.908
I stopped by the diner, let my
mom know that Sara was okay,

18:47.038 --> 18:48.866
and she made those
bread things that you like,

18:48.997 --> 18:50.651
so I picked up
a couple of those.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.481
Uh, Sheriff?

18:58.180 --> 19:00.791
I'm gonna need you to
hold down the fort for a bit.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.751
Is everything okay?

19:03.881 --> 19:06.928
Everything's fine.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.886
I'm gonna visit my wife.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.366
It's been a while.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.806
Okay?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.808
Yeah, sure.

19:25.816 --> 19:26.991
What the hell?

19:27.122 --> 19:30.647
You guys built a bar
in this fucking place?

19:30.778 --> 19:31.779
Yeah.
You end up in a place like this,

19:31.909 --> 19:34.173
you ask yourself,
what do the people need?

19:34.303 --> 19:37.611
Turns out it's not a fucking gas
station, so I figured...

19:41.615 --> 19:42.746
Hey, you okay?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.574
What?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.576
Are... you... okay?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.839
No, no, I'm not... okay.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.582
Are you okay?

19:52.713 --> 19:54.628
Great.
Here, drink this.

19:54.758 --> 19:55.933
It'll help you feel better.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.979
What the fuck?
How are you--

19:58.109 --> 20:00.677
why are you all
just sitting here?

20:03.027 --> 20:05.726
Holy fuck!
What is this shit?

20:05.856 --> 20:08.816
Just consider it your
poor man's potato vodka.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.043
You're one of the guys
from the two cars, huh?

20:22.133 --> 20:25.136
Your, uh, friend, uh--
friend got, uh...

20:25.267 --> 20:27.835
Yeah. Yeah.

20:27.965 --> 20:31.186
Look, if it's
any consolation, it--

20:31.317 --> 20:33.493
it gets easier, man,
it really does.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.888
Gets easier,
that's rich.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.716
That is fucking rich.

20:42.371 --> 20:46.157
You know, you guys are--
you're like rats in a maze,

20:46.288 --> 20:50.597
sitting there, contentedly...

20:50.727 --> 20:52.599
nibbling on your cheese.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.605
This is a paradox.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.999
That's the problem.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.049
The immediate question is,
how do we get home, right?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.965
How do we get out?
How do we get out of here?

21:13.141 --> 21:15.622
'Cause unless we
know where "here" is,

21:15.752 --> 21:17.058
we can't get outta here.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.061
It's like-- it's like... this,
it's like, uh,

21:20.191 --> 21:22.106
hitting a bull's-eye with
your eyes closed, right?

21:22.237 --> 21:23.717
You're just throwing 'em blind!

21:23.847 --> 21:26.110
You don't even fucking know
where the fucking target is!

21:26.241 --> 21:27.851
Maybe it's over here!
I don't know!

21:27.982 --> 21:29.288
Maybe it just, like,
went that way!

21:29.418 --> 21:32.595
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on!
-Throwing it!

21:32.726 --> 21:33.988
Settle down.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.773
Eventually, you just
get tired, you give up.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.993
You accept that
you can't just get out,

21:39.123 --> 21:40.081
'cause you have
no fucking idea

21:40.211 --> 21:41.691
where you're
trying to get out of.

21:41.822 --> 21:45.129
So, you sit around drinking
your acidic potato piss water

21:45.260 --> 21:46.914
that you call vodka.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.132
Yeah.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.787
So, let me guess,

21:50.918 --> 21:52.963
you're gonna be the guy
who figures it all out.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.052
You're goddamn right I am.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.664
People like me,
we design the maze,

21:57.794 --> 22:00.841
we place the cheese.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.191
I don't know what
you did before you got here,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.933
but I just sold a company
for an obscene amount of money

22:06.063 --> 22:08.152
based on a quantum
computing algorithm

22:08.283 --> 22:10.720
with the potential to...

22:10.851 --> 22:14.115
I'm not supposed to be here.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.118
I'm supposed to be
celebrating right now at...

22:19.468 --> 22:21.165
Look, the point is
we can't get out of here

22:21.296 --> 22:23.429
unless we know where "here" is.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.170
Right? To solve the paradox, you
gotta understand the paradox.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.042
You gotta identify it.
You gotta frame it.

22:28.172 --> 22:31.001
-Schrodinger's cat.
-What?

22:31.132 --> 22:33.482
Schrodinger's cat,
that-- that's the paradox.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.311
You put the cat in the box
and you close the box.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.834
As long as you never
open it again...

22:37.965 --> 22:40.315
The cat is theoretically alive
and dead at the same time.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.231
I know what
Schrodinger's cat is.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.277
Okay, so,
we're the cat.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.194
This place here
is the box, right?

22:50.325 --> 22:55.156
So, all those people
we left behind back home?

22:55.286 --> 22:56.897
Well, they're all
sitting around wondering

22:57.027 --> 22:59.029
if we're alive or dead.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.076
So, to them, we're both
things at the same time.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.995
I taught
Intro to Philosophy at USC.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.258
Hmm.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.174
Look, uh, I don't know
a fuckin' thing about computers,

23:13.304 --> 23:15.045
I'll be the first
to admit that.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.308
But that, uh--
that radio you brought in,

23:17.439 --> 23:19.963
well, if you're
so goddamn smart,

23:20.094 --> 23:22.096
why don't you figure out how
to get it broadcasting, huh?

23:22.226 --> 23:24.315
And I'll tell you what,

23:24.446 --> 23:29.103
if the cat
turns on the radio,

23:29.233 --> 23:31.975
you can be goddamn sure that
the people outside the box

23:32.106 --> 23:34.630
are at least gonna
know it's still alive.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.070
Huh.

No. No.

24:30.381 --> 24:33.254

to hurt people,

24:33.384 --> 24:36.431
but maybe it tries
to help people too.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.174
Maybe that can be one of
the questions on the wall.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.915
What would that be?

24:42.045 --> 24:45.396
Is there anyone
trying to help?

Much better, thank you.

Good. Uh, did Kristi
figure out what happened?

Not yet. It's...

25:19.430 --> 25:21.171
It's just one of
those things, I guess.

Yeah.

Well, I didn't come to
the U.S. until I was 11.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.637
I grew up in
a small village in Iran

27:18.767 --> 27:21.248
with my parents
and two older brothers.

27:21.378 --> 27:26.166
My father, he was
a very outspoken cleric,

27:26.296 --> 27:29.648
which wasn't always the most
popular thing to be at the time.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.477
One day, it was my birthday.

27:33.608 --> 27:38.134
Actually, we were getting
ready to go see my uncle.

27:38.265 --> 27:42.312
These men showed up.
They were angry, shouting.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.098
I remember my mother
told me to hide.

27:46.316 --> 27:50.451
But I was so confused
because we were just laughing.

27:50.581 --> 27:52.453
My father had told
this story about...

27:57.414 --> 27:59.678
He was a really
good storyteller.

27:59.808 --> 28:03.333

such an effective preacher.

Anyway, I could tell
my mother was afraid.

My brothers had run to the door
and now they were shouting too,

28:10.340 --> 28:14.170
and my mother just kept
saying "Hide, hide."

28:14.301 --> 28:17.434
But I just stood there,
I couldn't move,

28:17.565 --> 28:20.176
because it was all so strange.

28:20.307 --> 28:24.528
I mean, we were just laughing
so hard, you know?

28:24.659 --> 28:27.227
It was gonna be
the best birthday ever.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.403
The sun was so bright
coming in through the door

28:29.533 --> 28:32.101
that my father
became a silhouette

28:32.232 --> 28:34.713
when they dragged him outside.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.417
And then, there was this pop,

28:43.547 --> 28:46.550
like a firecracker,

28:46.681 --> 28:48.944
and the silhouette fell down.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.948
Oh, my God.

28:55.516 --> 28:58.737
The point is,

28:58.867 --> 29:01.522
there are always going to
be monsters in the world.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.524
It doesn't matter
where you are.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.700
But I promised myself

29:05.831 --> 29:08.703
I would never let them
scare the life out of me.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.488
-Oh, hey, hi.
-Hi!

29:12.446 --> 29:14.535
Ah, yeah, you just
look too dry. Come here!

29:14.665 --> 29:17.712
Oh, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

29:17.843 --> 29:20.149
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Yup, we're goin'!

29:20.280 --> 29:22.151
We're goin'! Hey!

29:22.282 --> 29:24.023
Julie, come on!

29:24.153 --> 29:25.546
Come on!

29:31.334 --> 29:32.379
That's the most like himself

29:32.509 --> 29:34.250
I've seen Ethan
since the accident.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.602
How long have you lived here?

29:38.733 --> 29:41.301
Just a few months.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.433
Mom and Dad are trying to
figure out where we are

29:43.564 --> 29:45.218
so we can all go home.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.611
That's what
the Cromenockle would do.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.526
What's a Cromenockle?

29:49.657 --> 29:53.182
She's a sweet girl.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.144
Hey, honey.
Don't make her sit there.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.885
Those things are filthy.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.323
It's okay.
It's-- it's actually kinda fun.

30:03.453 --> 30:07.153
Sara said we can go see the
goats and chickens at the barn.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.807
Really?

30:08.937 --> 30:10.896
My brother, he tends to all
the animals for the town.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.636
I thought it might
be fun to show Ethan.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.638
It's just down the street.

30:14.769 --> 30:17.424
Do you want to go?
I'm gonna tell Dad we're going.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.513
I can take him.

30:19.643 --> 30:20.601
I don't want to
take you guys away

30:20.731 --> 30:22.429
from anything
that you're doing.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.648
We're not doing anything.
Hey, Jim,

30:24.779 --> 30:26.433
I'll be right back.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.348
Okay.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.145
Hey, babe.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.323
It's been a while.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.805
Things have been...

30:50.936 --> 30:54.200
they've been a little
crazy past few days.

30:54.330 --> 30:57.507
Those, uh, things...

30:57.638 --> 31:00.859
they, uh...

31:00.989 --> 31:04.732
they got into the house
where the little girl lived,

31:04.863 --> 31:07.474
got into the clinic.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.260
You know, we were doing
pretty good for a while there,

31:11.391 --> 31:12.871
keeping everything together.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.655
It was almost
starting to feel like...

31:26.362 --> 31:28.887
Uh...

31:29.017 --> 31:33.413
I started getting tremors
in my hand a few weeks back,

31:33.543 --> 31:36.329
same way it started with my Dad,

31:36.459 --> 31:39.245
which means the clock
is officially ticking.

31:40.507 --> 31:44.424
But, see, uh...

31:44.554 --> 31:47.209
I have this crazy idea
that might actually work,

31:47.340 --> 31:49.472
and-and if it does,

31:49.603 --> 31:53.824
then I might be able to find
a way to get these people home,

31:53.955 --> 31:58.438
to get Ellis home.

31:58.568 --> 32:02.355
Of course if it doesn't,
if I'm wrong or if I fail,

32:02.485 --> 32:04.618
then, uh...

32:04.748 --> 32:06.750
then I'm leaving these people
in a worse-off position

32:06.881 --> 32:09.144
than they already are.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.586
You were always the one...

32:16.717 --> 32:18.719
You made all the hard calls.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.330
"Sometimes you got
to swing big, baby."

32:21.461 --> 32:23.680
'Member that?

32:25.726 --> 32:28.250
God, you had...

32:33.603 --> 32:36.606
I do this

32:36.737 --> 32:38.869
and that's about as big
a swing as I can take.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.742
And, um...

32:41.872 --> 32:44.136
And look, I know,
I know, I always said

32:44.266 --> 32:48.531
that I don't believe in signs
or any of that stuff, but...

32:51.056 --> 32:53.623
I could really use
one right now, okay?

32:55.930 --> 32:59.760
'Cause, babe,
I'm standing at the plate,

32:59.890 --> 33:02.284
and I'll swing if you
tell me to swing. I just...

33:07.072 --> 33:08.638
Babe, I just need
a little help here.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.249
Come on.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.469
I need a sign.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.305
Father Khatri?

33:25.742 --> 33:27.744
Nathan.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.399
Have you come up here much?

33:30.530 --> 33:32.575
No, not really.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.316
It's strange,
don't you think?

33:34.447 --> 33:37.798
A place like this...

33:37.928 --> 33:41.236
could exist in
a place like this?

33:43.760 --> 33:46.807
Um...

33:46.937 --> 33:50.898
I was wondering,
what are the rules?

33:51.029 --> 33:55.555
When it comes to confession,

33:55.685 --> 33:58.949
if I tell you something,

33:59.080 --> 34:00.690
does it stay between
the two of us?

34:00.821 --> 34:03.345
Anything you tell me
stays between us and God.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.522
What if it's bad?

34:08.698 --> 34:10.570
What if it's really bad?

34:12.876 --> 34:13.834
That one's name
is Alma.

34:13.964 --> 34:14.922
Hi, Alma.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.795
Oh, this is so much fun.
Thank you.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.971
It's my pleasure.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.670
Really,
he's a little sweetheart.

34:25.628 --> 34:26.934
Yeah.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.328
You have
a really nice family.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.417
Hmm.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.508
It's okay to be sad,
you know?

34:37.771 --> 34:39.294
And it's okay
to be afraid.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.560
Yeah, it seems the one thing

34:44.691 --> 34:46.693
that everyone
in this town agrees on.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.871
Really, though,
you'd be surprised

34:51.001 --> 34:53.526
how quickly
all this becomes normal.

34:57.747 --> 35:01.490
I don't want this
to become normal.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.666
I just want
to go back home.

35:04.798 --> 35:05.799
Me too.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.717
At least we have
the talismans, though.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.545
Father Khatri
always talks about

35:12.675 --> 35:13.894
how much worse
it was for people.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.592
They'd just hide
in places after dark,

35:16.723 --> 35:19.552
hoping the monsters
wouldn't find them.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.119
Those hiding places
are all over town.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.817
It's really good
to know about them,

35:23.947 --> 35:26.472
just in case you ever
get stuck outside after dark.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.648
Yeah, I guess.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.911
There's one in the barn.
I can show you where it is.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.869
Really?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.133
Yeah, it's just...
It's right inside.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.832
Uh, yeah.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.490
Honey, uh, I'll be right back,
okay? Don't move.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.795
This way.

35:56.241 --> 36:00.114
Nathan, you should've
come to me much sooner.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.595
I didn't--
Wait, wait.

36:02.725 --> 36:03.987
What's gonna happen to her?

36:04.118 --> 36:05.815
I don't want
her to go in the box.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.513
You gave your word.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.254
And I intend to keep it.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.734
But right now, we have to worry
about the people of the town.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.040
She'll be at the diner.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.564
Okay. Come on.

a weird question for you.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.761
If, uh...

37:21.891 --> 37:26.069
If someone asked for a sign,

how would they know

41:49.463 --> 41:51.160
She came into my house.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.076
She played with my kid.

41:54.207 --> 41:56.122
I know.

41:56.252 --> 41:58.124
Look, if there's
anything that we can do--

41:58.254 --> 41:59.995
The fuck is
wrong with you people?

42:00.126 --> 42:02.476
You talk like this place
is fucking Mayberry!

42:02.607 --> 42:05.218
One big family,
is that what you said?

42:05.348 --> 42:07.046
Are you fucking kidding me?

Um, we were
just coming back...

42:36.118 --> 42:38.033
Well, it doesn't
really matter.

42:38.164 --> 42:40.340
But he was running up the hill
towards the Colony House.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.342
You did good, Julie.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.352
Can you take him upstairs
for a minute?

42:52.482 --> 42:54.006
'Kay.

42:54.136 --> 42:55.790
You wanna go upstairs?

42:55.921 --> 42:57.139
Hmm?

42:58.358 --> 43:00.273
Come on, bug!

43:00.403 --> 43:04.016
Let's go read
the "Cromawhatsit."

43:04.146 --> 43:05.408
It's The Cromenockle.

43:05.539 --> 43:07.193
Oh, yeah, sure.

43:07.323 --> 43:09.195
That's what I said -
the "Cromawhatsit."

43:09.325 --> 43:11.937
Come on. All right.
Just take it slow.

43:12.067 --> 43:14.243
You're good.

43:14.374 --> 43:16.811
Yeah. You got this.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.387
I need something
to write with.

43:37.179 --> 43:39.442
Ask every question, right?

44:31.451 --> 44:32.931
Mind if I sit?

44:33.061 --> 44:34.062
Yeah.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.111
No. I mean,
yeah, you can sit.

44:39.241 --> 44:40.895
I understood.

44:48.860 --> 44:51.123
She just kept
asking these questions,

44:51.253 --> 44:54.082
like...

44:54.213 --> 44:55.301
what I would do to go home.

44:55.431 --> 44:56.694
Mm.

44:59.653 --> 45:01.611
I just had...

45:01.742 --> 45:04.179
It didn't cross
my mind that, um...

45:04.310 --> 45:06.007
Listen. Listen to me.

45:08.531 --> 45:10.098
This is not your fault.

45:18.628 --> 45:20.326
I spent the entire night
with her,

45:20.456 --> 45:23.590
and it was just nice
to sit and...

45:23.721 --> 45:27.463
talk and...

45:27.594 --> 45:30.510
...have a good time, and...

45:30.640 --> 45:33.469
that scalpel she used,
she took it from my clinic.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.646
So, if...
it's not my fault,

45:36.777 --> 45:40.389
then who--

45:40.520 --> 45:43.131
whose is it?

45:44.437 --> 45:46.091
You did not bring us here.

45:48.354 --> 45:51.052
You did not put whatever
thought she had in her head.

45:53.315 --> 45:56.492
You're just trying to
do the best you can.

45:56.623 --> 45:59.147
And a few nights ago, hey, look,

45:59.278 --> 46:03.717
you saved a little boy's life,

46:03.848 --> 46:08.026
and you're gonna save more lives
before this is all done.

Hey, hey.

Look.

Cut yourself
some slack. Okay?

46:32.398 --> 46:34.269
I'll be damned.

46:36.228 --> 46:37.533
What?

46:38.708 --> 46:40.406
What is it?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.715

47:09.348 --> 47:11.480
Well, it'd just
Be me and Trigger♪
