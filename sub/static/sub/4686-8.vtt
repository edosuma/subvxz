00:01.573 --> 00:03.895
Hello, I'm America's Jane Lynch.

00:03.928 --> 00:06.289
In October 2012,

00:06.346 --> 00:08.383
on the Paramount soundstages,

00:08.416 --> 00:10.427
the cast and crew of <i>Glee</i>

00:10.460 --> 00:12.648
filmed a Christmas episode

00:12.681 --> 00:16.416
entitled "Rough Trade Santa."

00:16.457 --> 00:17.885
Upon viewing the director's cut,

00:17.918 --> 00:20.826
Fox executives
recoiled in horror,

00:20.860 --> 00:22.703
and then locked the episode
in a lead vault,

00:22.744 --> 00:26.113
where it languished
for an entire year.

00:26.146 --> 00:29.196
A new, less-controversial
Christmas episode containing

00:29.229 --> 00:31.952
an entire act dedicated
to biracial Judaism

00:31.985 --> 00:35.059
was rushed into production
and aired in its place.

00:36.865 --> 00:39.611
After a year of pleas
from fans all over the world,

00:39.644 --> 00:41.113
the episode will now air...

00:41.154 --> 00:43.385
with several edits.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.324
Gone is an entire subplot

00:45.357 --> 00:48.169
involving Blaine and his
obsession with Yule logs.

00:48.202 --> 00:51.171
Lost forever are
several scenes explaining

00:51.204 --> 00:54.050
why Will Schuester abandoned
his Washington dreams

00:54.083 --> 00:56.018
to come back
and teach his merry band

00:56.051 --> 00:58.158
of miscreants and losers.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.028
So, sit back, relax,

01:02.069 --> 01:04.369
have some eggnog and enjoy,

01:04.410 --> 01:05.844
if you dare--

01:05.878 --> 01:08.814
the never-aired
<i>Glee</i> Christmas episode.

01:10.419 --> 01:11.594
(Glee Club whooping, applauding)

01:11.627 --> 01:12.866
We're going green, guys.

01:12.899 --> 01:14.403
(all cheering, whooping)

01:14.436 --> 01:16.237
I refuse to give up my wig

01:16.270 --> 01:17.914
and weave-aerosolized
luster spray!

01:17.947 --> 01:19.381
Okay, you're fine, Unique.

01:19.414 --> 01:20.952
This year's theme
for the 50th Annual

01:20.985 --> 01:24.120
McKinley Classroom
Decorating contest is...

01:24.161 --> 01:25.258
"Green is Good."

01:25.291 --> 01:26.799
(all whooping)
Sam, Tina.

01:26.832 --> 01:29.302
All right, well, as seniors,
Mr. Shue asked us

01:29.335 --> 01:31.336
to take over the, uh,
decorating committee this year,

01:31.369 --> 01:33.445
so we're gonna need everyone's
help in order to win this thing.

01:33.481 --> 01:34.554
Oh, and we will win.

01:34.587 --> 01:35.987
Because first prize is

01:36.020 --> 01:37.091
an antique glass angel,

01:37.124 --> 01:39.257
hand-blown thousands
of years ago.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.492
This holy glass ornament is
said to have magical powers

01:41.526 --> 01:43.463
to bring good luck,
and possibly a boyfriend

01:43.506 --> 01:45.403
or prom queen dreams
to whoever she oversees.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.141
And that person will be me.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.817
Um, don't we all get
to share the prize?

01:48.850 --> 01:50.517
We're going au naturel
this year.

01:50.558 --> 01:52.529
We're gonna get pine cones,
L.E.D. lights.

01:52.563 --> 01:54.793
Are we getting those
from the L.E.D. bush out back?

01:54.826 --> 01:56.667
This is exactly
the kind of in-fighting

01:56.700 --> 01:58.331
that will make us lose, and
I'm not gonna stand for it.

01:58.372 --> 01:59.772
Guys, this is serious!

01:59.805 --> 02:01.110
Cancel your plans
for the entire month.

02:01.143 --> 02:02.515
I don't want to hear
about any of you

02:02.548 --> 02:03.612
caroling in nursing homes

02:03.653 --> 02:04.652
or feeding the homeless

02:04.685 --> 02:05.949
or giving toys to tots.

02:05.990 --> 02:07.657
Every waking thought will
be spent figuring out

02:07.690 --> 02:09.291
how to win me that stupid angel.

02:09.332 --> 02:10.334
Got it?

02:11.433 --> 02:12.971
Well.

02:13.004 --> 02:15.046
Merry Christmas, everyone.

02:15.079 --> 02:16.313
♪ Joy to the... ♪

02:16.353 --> 02:17.315
ALL:
Shut up, Blaine!

02:17.356 --> 02:18.097
Okay.

02:18.124 --> 02:21.198

02:21.318 --> 02:23.770
The McKinley High
Non-Denominational

02:23.803 --> 02:26.213
Christmas Club meeting
is now called to order.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.514
Vice President Artie Abrams

02:28.547 --> 02:29.883
has the floor.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.052
This Christmas club looks
an awful lot like Glee Club.

02:32.094 --> 02:33.526
ARTIE:
Nobody panic.

02:33.559 --> 02:34.959
But Principal Figgins
just informed me

02:34.992 --> 02:36.968
that McKinley's outdoor manger
scene has been defaced

02:37.001 --> 02:40.437
with swastikas
and with Satanic symbols.

02:40.470 --> 02:43.379
And Baby Jesus was found stuffed
down Figgins' chimney.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.252
Oh, my God, that's horrible!

02:45.285 --> 02:47.285
Christmas is canceled!

02:47.326 --> 02:49.761
Not quite yet, Tina.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.134
Figgins asked
the Christmas Club to step in...

02:52.167 --> 02:54.173
and do a living nativity.

02:54.206 --> 02:56.006
Christmas is saved.

02:56.039 --> 02:57.943
And Artie and I have decided

02:57.976 --> 02:59.607
that Jake should play Joseph.
I mean...

02:59.648 --> 03:02.314
Joseph was a darkly tanned Jew.

03:02.347 --> 03:03.915
Thank you?

03:03.956 --> 03:06.190
I call dibs on arguably
the most important female role

03:06.223 --> 03:08.160
in the history of the world.

03:08.193 --> 03:09.665
The Virgin Mary.

03:09.698 --> 03:11.701
You can't. You're black,
and you'd crush the donkey.

03:11.734 --> 03:12.701
I'm a virgin!

03:12.742 --> 03:14.574
That's a shocker.

03:14.607 --> 03:15.679
To think nobody's tickled

03:15.712 --> 03:17.546
inside of your musty,
mildewed granny panties

03:17.579 --> 03:19.621
except for the family
of crickets that nest in there.

03:19.654 --> 03:21.255
Yeah, well...

03:21.288 --> 03:22.959
you wear
a smaller bra than me!

03:22.992 --> 03:24.329
RYDER:
All right, girls, come on, okay?

03:24.362 --> 03:26.162
It's Christmas, and
we've got a show to do.

03:26.195 --> 03:28.898
Wait, are manger scenes even
allowed on school property?

03:30.709 --> 03:31.869
Auditions are tomorrow.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.480
(blows whistle)

03:33.513 --> 03:35.417
KURT:
Mmm, what is it? What is it?

03:35.450 --> 03:36.586
(gasps)

03:36.619 --> 03:38.589
Oh, my gosh!

03:38.622 --> 03:40.160
It's My Pretty Princess

03:40.193 --> 03:42.696
Deluxe-All-Jazzed-Up
Styling Head!

03:42.729 --> 03:45.033
Aw, Santana, I love it!
Thank you so much.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.206
Oh, I had one of these
when I was ten.

03:47.239 --> 03:49.111
And I was obsessed with her.

03:49.144 --> 03:51.879
I-I gave this lady
smoky eyes every day.

03:51.912 --> 03:53.344
Well, merry Christmas,
Lady Hummel.

03:53.385 --> 03:55.880
Now you can relive all
your Jeffrey Dahmer fantasies

03:55.921 --> 03:57.417
in the privacy of your own home.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.226
But that's not it because
additionally I am giving you

04:00.259 --> 04:01.555
an all-expense-paid trip

04:01.596 --> 04:03.060
to Dildo Island.

04:03.093 --> 04:04.395
It's a real place,
it's in Canada.

04:04.428 --> 04:06.426
I got you the deluxe
bachelor package.

04:06.467 --> 04:09.130
I think this calls for another
glass of my world-famous eggnog.

04:09.163 --> 04:10.370
- Huh?
- Yes.

04:10.403 --> 04:11.499
I'm using Giada's recipe,

04:11.540 --> 04:13.708
but you tell me if it's
too much all-spice.

04:13.742 --> 04:15.744
You know what I will tell you
is that I think

04:15.777 --> 04:17.378
that you've actually
become more of a Grandma Moses

04:17.418 --> 04:18.618
since moving to New York.

04:18.651 --> 04:20.281
I mean, you just had
a traumatic break-up

04:20.314 --> 04:22.089
with Princess Valiant,
and you're single,

04:22.123 --> 04:23.459
you should be living it up.

04:23.492 --> 04:24.556
Oh, like you?

04:24.589 --> 04:26.196
Breezing through here
unannounced,

04:26.229 --> 04:27.860
with a sleigh full
of Christmas decorations

04:27.893 --> 04:29.629
and presents
Ã  la Auntie Mame?

04:29.662 --> 04:31.966
By the way, all of these
aren't for us, are they?

04:31.999 --> 04:34.008
Oh, no, no, no, I mean,
you got your decapitated head.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.535
And one of these
is for Berry.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.239
A gallon jug of
ProActiv solution

04:37.272 --> 04:38.975
and a booklet of
JetBlue vouchers.

04:39.008 --> 04:40.342
The rest are for me.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.710
After what happened
with Brittany,

04:41.743 --> 04:44.312
I prescribed myself a
little retail therapy.

04:44.353 --> 04:46.617
Mm-hmm.
Couldn't be in Lima
right now, you know?

04:46.650 --> 04:48.489
Not with her there,
it's too soon.

04:48.523 --> 04:50.858
But now I have to
book myself a hotel.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.724
In New York City
during the holidays?

04:52.765 --> 04:54.364
Are you crazy? Do you know
how expensive that will be?

04:54.397 --> 04:56.499
Calm down, Joyce DeWitt.

04:56.532 --> 04:57.835
Okay? It's gonna be fine.

04:57.868 --> 04:58.900
Don't you remember that money

04:58.933 --> 05:00.268
that my mom gave me
for graduation?

05:00.301 --> 05:01.700
Your college fund?
Mm-hmm.

05:01.741 --> 05:03.109
Please tell me
you didn't spend it all

05:03.142 --> 05:04.142
on post-breakup gifts
for yourself.

05:04.175 --> 05:05.510
No, no, just half.

05:05.543 --> 05:07.376
(door opens)
RACHEL: Kurt?

05:07.417 --> 05:08.911
Oh, my God, Santana!

05:08.945 --> 05:09.950
What are you doing here?

05:09.983 --> 05:12.287
We have our first
holiday house guest.

05:12.321 --> 05:14.088
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

05:14.121 --> 05:15.856
I decided that I wanted to do
something a little different

05:15.889 --> 05:17.119
for the holidays this year.

05:17.152 --> 05:18.788
In that case, you're in luck.

05:18.821 --> 05:20.157
Because I just
got Kurt and I

05:20.191 --> 05:21.295
the greatest gig,
and you can get in

05:21.328 --> 05:22.296
on it, too, if you want!

05:22.329 --> 05:25.663
We are gonna be
Christmas elves

05:25.696 --> 05:27.000
in Santa Land at
the Midtown Mall!

05:27.033 --> 05:28.136
I know what you're thinking,

05:28.169 --> 05:29.402
but I've done my research.

05:29.435 --> 05:30.841
And this is where all
of the Broadway luminaries

05:30.874 --> 05:33.007
bring their children,
so we'll have tons of exposure.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.008
It's gonna be great, please
say you're in! Are you in?

05:35.041 --> 05:37.179
Come on, we'll all
do it together.

05:37.981 --> 05:38.949
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah!

05:38.982 --> 05:40.180
Yay!

05:40.221 --> 05:41.547
ALL:
Cheers!

05:41.588 --> 05:44.653
I am gonna be
the best Jewish elf ever.

05:44.686 --> 05:45.852
I'm serious, okay?

05:45.893 --> 05:47.325
What could be greener
than foraging

05:47.356 --> 05:48.658
in the woods
for Christmas decorations?

05:48.691 --> 05:51.225
Our Christmas tree will have,
like, a zero carbon footprint.

05:51.257 --> 05:53.129
Except for cutting down
a perfectly healthy tree

05:53.162 --> 05:54.394
and throwing it away
two weeks later.

05:54.427 --> 05:55.530
Well... (stammers)
exactly!

05:55.563 --> 05:57.267
I'll go into
the West Lima Forest Preserve

05:57.300 --> 05:59.434
and get pine cones,
deer antlers,

05:59.467 --> 06:00.833
fallen branches
and make them into wreaths,

06:00.866 --> 06:02.936
and you'd be surprised
at how many Hispanic families

06:02.969 --> 06:04.368
throw birthday parties in there.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.567
I'm even gonna collect
all the, uh,

06:05.608 --> 06:08.508
deflated mylar <i>"feliz</i>
<i>cumpleaños"</i> balloons

06:08.541 --> 06:09.938
and then I'm gonna make
tinsel out of it.

06:09.971 --> 06:10.969
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

06:11.002 --> 06:12.611
Hold it right there, sluts!

06:12.644 --> 06:13.611
Hey, Becky.

06:13.644 --> 06:14.937
This is mistletoe.

06:14.978 --> 06:17.607
I'm super horny, so you
better give me some tongue!

06:17.640 --> 06:18.838
- What?
- Whoa!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.207
I mean it, bitch!

06:20.247 --> 06:22.280
I want to lick
those Asian tonsils!

06:22.313 --> 06:24.448
And then once she's
got me all warmed up,

06:24.481 --> 06:25.752
I'm gonna make you French me

06:25.785 --> 06:27.382
because it's Christmas
and I'm loose.

06:27.415 --> 06:28.582
Oh, dear God.

06:28.623 --> 06:30.624
Becky, you can't just make us
French kiss you.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.223
Yes, I can, stripper!

06:32.256 --> 06:34.589
I have special needs,
and one of my special needs

06:34.622 --> 06:37.193
is mouth sex with your face!

06:37.234 --> 06:38.233
No, Becky!
This is not okay.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.697
You get away with murder
at this school

06:39.730 --> 06:40.898
because Sue has made you believe

06:40.938 --> 06:42.001
that the rules
don't apply to you!

06:42.034 --> 06:43.167
It's discrimination!

06:43.199 --> 06:44.438
SUE:
Ah-ah-ah, no, it's not, honey.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.871
Becky?

06:45.904 --> 06:47.243
That's poison sumac.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.545
That's not mistletoe.

06:48.578 --> 06:50.112
Get your little butt
to the nurse's office

06:50.145 --> 06:52.111
for a Silkwood shower, stat!

06:52.144 --> 06:53.210
Can I take the LeCar?

06:53.251 --> 06:55.451
Of course you can take
the LeCar.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.123
Oh, Asian Number One.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.618
Stupid Trouty Joe
the Happy Strippin' Hobo.

07:00.659 --> 07:02.994
You're exactly right.
I have been treating

07:03.027 --> 07:05.023
Becky differently than all
the other kids at this school

07:05.056 --> 07:06.255
when I probably should've
just treated her

07:06.288 --> 07:07.959
like everybody else.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.191
You've made your point,
fair is fair.

07:10.232 --> 07:11.863
And I will adjust
my behavior accordingly.

07:11.896 --> 07:13.063
Geez, I just think she needs

07:13.096 --> 07:15.063
to be treated for some
sort of sex addiction.

07:15.104 --> 07:16.934
Yeah, okay, I got it, got it.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.901
I'm here to inform you
that Principal Figgins

07:18.934 --> 07:20.700
has made me
in charge of judging

07:20.733 --> 07:23.337
the 50th Annual Christmas Tree
Decorating Contest.

07:23.370 --> 07:26.675
A longstanding tradition
here at McKinley High

07:26.708 --> 07:28.780
even though
we didn't do it last year.

07:28.813 --> 07:30.178
Or the year before.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.880
Or the year before that.

07:32.913 --> 07:34.946
Anyhoo, I'm just thrilled
to be able

07:34.979 --> 07:35.985
to judge the Glee
Christmas tree

07:36.018 --> 07:38.317
so I can rank it dead last.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.014
Because I'm sure
it's covered

07:40.047 --> 07:41.751
with condoms and dental dams

07:41.784 --> 07:44.056
and suicide hotline
pamphlets

07:44.089 --> 07:45.655
and at-home-sex-change kits.

07:45.688 --> 07:47.958
I know that sounds harsh.

07:47.991 --> 07:49.463
But maybe it's just
the motivation

07:49.496 --> 07:50.495
that poor little
Christmas tree needs

07:50.528 --> 07:52.295
to go out and conquer its dreams

07:52.328 --> 07:54.895
to hop out of that
Christmas tree stand,

07:54.936 --> 07:57.872
fly to New York
and audition for NYADA.

07:57.905 --> 07:59.672
(grunts) Huh?

07:59.705 --> 08:01.302
(laughs)

08:01.335 --> 08:03.342
(singing indistinctly)

08:10.845 --> 08:13.980
KIDS (chanting):
We want Santa! We want Santa!

08:14.012 --> 08:17.390
We want Santa!
We want Santa!

08:17.423 --> 08:19.325
(sighs)

08:19.358 --> 08:21.260
I'm seriously regretting
these tights.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.957
They smell like Williamstown,

08:22.990 --> 08:24.662
and they're giving me
serious mangina.

08:24.695 --> 08:26.029
And I am seriously sensing

08:26.062 --> 08:28.657
some workplace sexism
happening over here.

08:28.698 --> 08:30.161
All these little lady
elves are dressed

08:30.193 --> 08:32.126
like candy-striped hookers.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.631
Do you think they'll let me
keep this when we're done?

08:34.664 --> 08:37.669
Because I am loving
this look on me.

08:37.703 --> 08:39.400
Lord of the Bling.

08:39.441 --> 08:41.809
We want Santa! We want Santa!

08:41.842 --> 08:43.503
Has anyone seen Santa?

08:43.544 --> 08:45.437
These Manhattan kids aren't
gonna wait much longer.

08:45.478 --> 08:46.573
Uh, there he is.

08:46.606 --> 08:49.340
Merry Christmas!
(laughs)

08:49.381 --> 08:51.546
Oh, ho, ho, oh! Calm down.

08:51.579 --> 08:53.178
Calm down, here I am!

08:53.211 --> 08:54.811
(laughing)

08:54.851 --> 08:58.715
No flash photos before I get
on my throne, though, okay?

08:58.756 --> 09:01.323
Ah!

09:01.356 --> 09:03.218
Ho, ho, ho! Oh!

09:03.259 --> 09:05.626
Lady elves.

09:05.659 --> 09:08.592
Santa, great.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.361
Uh, well, can we get
this line moving for you?

09:15.435 --> 09:18.140
A) Don't ever look directly
at me again, Keebler.

09:18.173 --> 09:19.340
Ever!

09:20.372 --> 09:21.506
I don't like you

09:21.539 --> 09:23.811
and your Equity card attitude.

09:23.844 --> 09:26.718
So I'm gonna hit the men's room
and craft services,

09:26.751 --> 09:29.748
aka my flask.

09:29.789 --> 09:33.326
Why don't you take care
of keeping these kids busy?

09:33.359 --> 09:36.893
Huh? Maybe you could do
that <i>Rent</i> medley

09:36.926 --> 09:40.595
that you learned at the last
open mic cabaret night, huh?

09:40.628 --> 09:43.425
(laughs)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

09:43.466 --> 09:45.603
Okay, this crowd
is about to get fugly.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.098
Do we have a plan?

09:48.139 --> 09:49.771
There is always a plan.

09:49.804 --> 09:51.338
We are gonna work
some NYADA magic.

09:51.372 --> 09:52.370
Santana, grab
a candy cane.

09:52.403 --> 09:53.674
Kurt, hit it.

Ah, just goes to show you,

11:58.692 --> 12:00.995
all you need is just
a little magic.

12:01.028 --> 12:03.867
Let's go already!
You guys suck eggs!

12:05.332 --> 12:06.404
Oh, my God!

12:06.437 --> 12:08.141
(screaming)

12:10.685 --> 12:12.019
Hey.

12:12.055 --> 12:14.796
Us girls were talking and
we figured that since all of us

12:14.829 --> 12:16.395
obviously want to play
the Virgin Mary

12:16.428 --> 12:18.529
in the nativity scene,
we should all audition together.

12:18.562 --> 12:19.530
No, thanks.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.531
Okay. I was just
trying to be nice.

12:21.564 --> 12:25.038
I have a very low tolerance
for nice.

12:25.071 --> 12:26.975
I may seem really cool
and loving for a week or two,

12:27.008 --> 12:29.173
but then my body rejects it
like a virus

12:29.214 --> 12:30.982
and I move back
into my natural state

12:31.015 --> 12:32.077
of cruel, selfish
insensitivity.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.079
The fact is,
that between lady-man

12:34.120 --> 12:35.687
and his junk flapping
around on stage,

12:35.720 --> 12:37.782
you probably passing out at
some point during the audition,

12:37.823 --> 12:39.684
and the basic truth
that there is no way

12:39.717 --> 12:41.555
they're going to let
a Chinese girl play Mary.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.989
I think Tina's Korean.

12:43.022 --> 12:45.662
I would get that part hands down
if I wanted it.

12:45.695 --> 12:47.199
But I don't.

12:51.399 --> 12:52.565

12:52.598 --> 12:55.778

12:58.040 --> 12:59.006
(annoyed):
What?

12:59.039 --> 13:00.877
Where are you?!

13:00.910 --> 13:02.780
I'm taking
a much-needed break, okay?

13:02.813 --> 13:04.711
It is exhausting
playing a slutty elf.

13:04.752 --> 13:05.752
KURT:
Get back here!

13:05.785 --> 13:07.216
Santa passed out
in his own vomit

13:07.249 --> 13:08.320
and probably
crapped his pants.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.886
And until the mall can find
a replacement,

13:09.919 --> 13:11.886
we need you to come back
and play Mrs. Claus!

13:11.920 --> 13:14.791
No, no, you play Mrs. Claus,
Lady Hummel.

13:14.825 --> 13:18.190
You were born to play
Mrs. Claus and Mrs. Butterworth

13:18.231 --> 13:19.927
and Bea Arthur
and Barbara Bush.

13:19.968 --> 13:21.864

15:50.839 --> 15:52.976
Well, it turns out
Santa has got a bit

15:53.009 --> 15:54.015
of a drinking problem.

15:54.048 --> 15:55.446
Got into the schnapps
last night,

15:55.479 --> 15:57.878
and he was a little hard
to get out of bed.

15:57.918 --> 16:00.383
But-but... but it is actually
Mrs. Claus

16:00.416 --> 16:01.783
who's been writing the list

16:01.824 --> 16:04.719
of who's been naughty
and who's been nice

16:04.760 --> 16:06.823
and forcing us elves
to work at the sweatshop,

16:06.856 --> 16:09.294
and she has made
a special trip to Santa Land,

16:09.327 --> 16:12.027

what you want for Christmas!

16:12.060 --> 16:13.091

16:14.734 --> 16:16.469
Who's excited?!

16:16.502 --> 16:18.605
So here she is,
Mrs. Claus!

16:20.734 --> 16:22.637

16:30.216 --> 16:31.183
Whoo!

16:31.216 --> 16:33.453
And what would you
like for Christmas?

16:33.486 --> 16:35.819
I want a Doc McStuffins
Time-for-Your-Check-up Doll.

16:35.852 --> 16:37.252
Ooh, so cute.

16:37.285 --> 16:38.725
Well, that sounds
a little molesty.

16:38.758 --> 16:41.188
I mean, I didn't start
playing doctor till I was nine.

16:41.221 --> 16:42.556
I'll see what
I can do.

16:42.589 --> 16:46.334
I think that somebody needs
to freeze the fat for Christmas

16:46.367 --> 16:49.198
because somebody weighs
more than Mrs. Claus.

16:49.231 --> 16:50.197
Whoa, stop right there.

16:50.238 --> 16:52.333
You look a little
Jewish, right?

16:52.366 --> 16:53.836
Rachel, you think?

16:53.869 --> 16:54.900
Okay, bye.

16:54.941 --> 16:56.268
I think...
Did you...?

16:56.309 --> 16:57.803
I think he pooped
in his pants.

16:57.836 --> 17:01.241
I want a Kinder College
Learning Laptop.

17:01.274 --> 17:02.903
Why don't we just
get you an iPad?

17:02.944 --> 17:04.109
You can't even
get porn

17:04.143 --> 17:05.806
on whatever you just
asked me for, okay?

17:05.846 --> 17:08.814
Ah!

17:08.847 --> 17:10.348
Hey, how's it going?

17:10.382 --> 17:13.012
You look exactly
like a young

17:13.045 --> 17:15.284
Brittany S. Pierce,
doesn't she?

17:15.317 --> 17:17.955
Brittany is my ex-girlfriend,
and she just dumped me,

17:17.989 --> 17:20.451
which is why I'm even here
and why I have this job.

17:20.492 --> 17:21.753
And we're lesbians.

17:21.787 --> 17:23.458
You know, and, like,
I'd never been with...

17:23.491 --> 17:25.961
Okay, great job!

17:25.993 --> 17:27.592
What would you like
for Christmas?

17:27.625 --> 17:28.759
I'd like...

17:28.792 --> 17:30.159
Oh, no, you know what?

17:30.192 --> 17:31.789
I think that you
should ask Santa

17:31.830 --> 17:34.492
to get your daddy a job
with some dental benefits,

17:34.526 --> 17:36.261
because your grill
is freaking jacked up.

17:36.302 --> 17:37.830
Do you see this?

17:37.871 --> 17:39.734
I think that Mrs. Claus
needs a break.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.934
This is going well, right?

17:41.870 --> 17:43.837
You guys, she's coming!

17:46.142 --> 17:47.476
And one, two...

17:47.509 --> 17:50.105
(humming "O Tannenbaum")

18:09.161 --> 18:11.296
What's this ornament made of?

18:11.329 --> 18:14.032
It's a suet cake
for migratory songbirds,

18:14.064 --> 18:16.402
and it's loaded
with wildflower seeds

18:16.435 --> 18:18.542
for the birds to poop out
in their deforested

18:18.575 --> 18:20.174
wintering grounds
in the Amazon River Basin.

18:20.207 --> 18:21.909
- What species?
- BOTH: Douglas fir!

18:21.942 --> 18:23.046
Which is the primary habitat of?

18:23.079 --> 18:25.247
Red tree vole.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.117
And what happened to the vole
you left homeless

18:27.150 --> 18:28.316
when you cut down this tree?

18:28.349 --> 18:30.286
Um, do you mean Richie?

18:30.319 --> 18:33.485
Because he came here
to live with us.

18:34.589 --> 18:37.093
(humming continues)

18:37.127 --> 18:39.230
Well, Glee Club,
I gotta hand it to you.

18:39.263 --> 18:41.495
I thought Becky Jackson
was going to take

18:41.536 --> 18:44.335
first prize this year, but she
didn't really get the concept

18:44.368 --> 18:45.870
of "green decorations."

18:45.903 --> 18:47.206
Here it is, Coach!

18:50.404 --> 18:52.441
See? Everything's green!

18:52.474 --> 18:55.869
Green apples,
green bananas, peas,

18:55.902 --> 18:57.604
an Apple Jacks box,

18:57.635 --> 19:01.073
grass clippings, moldy bread.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.504
I won't be announ...

19:02.537 --> 19:03.840
You're still humming.

19:05.305 --> 19:07.578
Okay.

19:07.611 --> 19:10.285
I won't be announcing the winner
until tomorrow morning,

19:10.318 --> 19:13.991
but I have to admit,
for once, Glee Club,

19:14.024 --> 19:16.666
you haven't totally screwed
everything up.

19:18.034 --> 19:19.432
Happy holidays.

19:19.465 --> 19:21.462
(humming continues)

19:32.804 --> 19:35.073
(vocalizing)

19:35.106 --> 19:36.104
(whooping)

19:37.845 --> 19:39.595
Since this year's
living nativity

19:39.628 --> 19:40.864
has a singing element to it,

19:40.897 --> 19:43.558
and since I'm no expert
when it comes to judging

19:43.599 --> 19:44.765
show choir star power...

19:44.798 --> 19:46.929
I am, in fact,
sitting right here.

19:46.962 --> 19:49.632
...I asked Mr. Shue
to help out with our auditions

19:49.665 --> 19:51.159
- for the Virgin Mary.
- Thanks, Coach.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.333
I'm happy to help judge
your potential virgins.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.059
And it looks like
first up we have

19:55.100 --> 19:56.867
- a group audition.
- Yes.

19:56.900 --> 19:57.867
Ladies, whenever
you're ready,

19:57.899 --> 19:59.066
the manger is yours.

(whooping)

22:04.921 --> 22:05.888
Wow.

22:05.921 --> 22:08.091
Ladies, I'm breathless.

22:08.124 --> 22:09.629
And I've got a little
Jamaican in me,

22:09.662 --> 22:10.861
and that
touched home

22:10.894 --> 22:12.564
in a very real way.

22:12.597 --> 22:15.532
Are there any other last-minute
auditions for the Virgin Mary?

22:20.777 --> 22:22.479
(sighs)

22:26.048 --> 22:27.415
No, but I'm afraid
we're gonna get killed.

22:27.448 --> 22:29.249
There's, like, a mob
of angry parents out there.

22:29.282 --> 22:32.027
We're never gonna get hired
as holiday retail temps again.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.195
It's over,
it's all over.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.162
No, it's not.

22:35.195 --> 22:36.329
How you doing?

22:36.362 --> 22:38.590
Cody Tolentino.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.293
But you can just
call me "Sexy Claus."

22:40.327 --> 22:42.062
Heard some
chatter about

22:42.095 --> 22:43.063
there was some
trouble over here?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.231
Us Santas
tend to keep

22:44.264 --> 22:46.397
pretty close ranks.
SANTANA:
Okay, listen.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.600
Even I'll admit that
my girl-loving vagina

22:48.641 --> 22:50.240
is feeling a little
jingle bell from you,

22:50.273 --> 22:51.671
but, uh, we don't
need your help.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.237
Okay, well, then...

22:53.270 --> 22:55.139
I'll just go.

22:55.172 --> 22:56.603
But if I were you guys,
I would...

22:56.643 --> 22:57.975
I would leave out the back door.

22:58.008 --> 22:59.872
I mean, these places tend
to turn people into animals

22:59.905 --> 23:02.041
when 'tis
the season.

23:02.082 --> 23:03.209
You mess with somebody's Yule,

23:03.250 --> 23:04.409
and they will trample your ass.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.216
Okay, no, please.
I'm sorry, we-we don't...

23:06.249 --> 23:07.681
we don't want to be
trampled, so...

23:07.714 --> 23:08.753
what do we
need to do?

23:08.786 --> 23:10.050
KURT:
Yes. Anything. Truly.

23:10.091 --> 23:11.923
Uh, I'm Kurt, by the way.
Newly single.

23:11.956 --> 23:13.356
Well, it's not a one-day fix.

23:13.389 --> 23:14.492
I can calm things down

23:14.525 --> 23:16.596
for today, but if
you truly want

23:16.629 --> 23:17.964
to save Christmas
for this store

23:17.997 --> 23:19.133
and all of you,

23:19.166 --> 23:20.798
it's gonna take
the rest of the week.

23:20.839 --> 23:23.176
I hereby deputize
each of you

23:23.209 --> 23:24.375
as my elves.

23:24.408 --> 23:26.207
Ooh, we're deputized.
Sounds fun.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.480
What are our
responsibilities?

23:27.513 --> 23:29.447
Well, let's not get
into that just yet.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.943
I like to get to know
my elves first.

23:30.984 --> 23:32.081
So what do
you guys say?

23:32.114 --> 23:33.852
Maybe dinner?

23:33.885 --> 23:34.852
Your place?

23:34.893 --> 23:35.852
How's 8:00?

23:35.893 --> 23:37.020
Right on.

23:37.061 --> 23:38.660
Merry Christmas, everybody.

23:38.694 --> 23:39.693
Ho ho ho.

23:41.631 --> 23:43.163
And that's why
ancient Egyptians

23:43.196 --> 23:45.067
regarded dung beetles
as sacred.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.195
(chiming over P.A. system)

23:47.268 --> 23:48.331
Attention, McKinley idiots.

23:48.372 --> 23:49.739
Come on.

23:49.772 --> 23:51.307
Here are your morning
announcements that were

23:51.340 --> 23:53.402
obviously too unimportant
to be mentioned until now.

23:53.443 --> 23:54.674
The three runners-up

23:54.707 --> 23:56.340
in the politically-correct

23:56.381 --> 23:58.311
green-themed Christmas Tree

23:58.352 --> 24:00.181
Decorating Contest are...

24:00.214 --> 24:01.212
the Biology Club...

24:03.182 --> 24:04.149
...the 420 Club...

24:04.190 --> 24:05.718
Oh, sick.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.791
...and Beiste
and the football team.

24:07.824 --> 24:08.864
(whoops)

24:08.897 --> 24:10.192
BECKY:
What about me, Coach?

24:10.233 --> 24:12.130
What about me?

24:12.163 --> 24:14.203
Inside voice, Becky.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.572
And the winner

24:17.605 --> 24:19.912
of the tacky plastic angel
made in the Philippines

24:19.945 --> 24:22.018
by a 12-year-old child slave

24:22.051 --> 24:23.850
is...

24:23.884 --> 24:26.220
bah, humbug...
the glee club.

24:26.261 --> 24:28.461
(cheering, screaming)

24:30.568 --> 24:33.535
(panting)
Don't, Becky.
Becky, don't.

24:33.568 --> 24:35.737
(screams)
Becky, no.
Don't, don't...

24:35.770 --> 24:36.738
Whoa!

24:36.771 --> 24:38.211
(P.A. goes silent)

24:39.245 --> 24:41.047
Everything's fine.

24:43.618 --> 24:46.154
(school bell rings)
Okay.

24:46.195 --> 24:47.763
(sighs)

24:47.796 --> 24:49.027
(sighs)
Yeah.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.562
- That's it.
- Yep.

24:50.595 --> 24:51.728
Thanks, Will.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.661
(sighs)

24:56.365 --> 24:57.661
(growls)

25:00.641 --> 25:02.206
KITTY:
Shocker.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.573
The virgin Marley

25:03.607 --> 25:05.006
gets to play
the Virgin Mary.

25:05.039 --> 25:07.343
Aren't you worried
about typecasting?

25:07.376 --> 25:08.846
What's with the snark?

25:08.879 --> 25:09.974
I asked you to audition,

25:10.015 --> 25:11.710
and you said...
I didn't want it.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.583
You obviously do.

25:13.616 --> 25:15.751
I don't get it.

25:15.784 --> 25:17.551
If this is something
that is important to you,

25:17.584 --> 25:18.551
maybe we can talk

25:18.592 --> 25:19.655
to Mr. Shue...

25:19.688 --> 25:21.425
Don't you get it?

25:21.458 --> 25:23.128
I'm a Christian,
and I know what it means

25:23.161 --> 25:25.162
to have the Virgin Mary's
spirit in your heart.

25:26.964 --> 25:28.971
I don't have it.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.801
And I don't deserve
to be her.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.410
To tell you
the truth,

25:34.443 --> 25:36.379
I'm more like
Mary Magdalene.

25:36.412 --> 25:38.316
Hey...

25:44.321 --> 25:46.328
Do we really have to take down
all of the ornaments?

25:46.361 --> 25:48.456
Rachel, yes.

25:48.497 --> 25:50.191
I thought it'd be nice
to have a tree-trimming party

25:50.231 --> 25:51.695
to, you know, get us in

25:51.728 --> 25:53.367
the holiday spirit.
We all set in there?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.695
If, by "all set," you mean

25:54.736 --> 25:56.938
did I light the candy-cane
scented candles on the toilet,

25:56.971 --> 25:58.337
then yes, we are all set.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.168
Good, perfect.

26:00.209 --> 26:01.537
Now, here.
Try this.

26:01.577 --> 26:03.547
I added some nutmeg.

26:03.580 --> 26:04.548
No.

26:04.581 --> 26:05.548
I think that
needs some kick.

26:05.581 --> 26:06.546
I mean, come on, Kurt.

26:06.579 --> 26:07.848
Don't all you gays
love Julia Child?

26:07.881 --> 26:09.216
Didn't she, like,
spike everything?

26:09.249 --> 26:10.648
Well, I guess
I could add

26:10.681 --> 26:11.984
- some cooking sherry in here.
- Yes.

26:12.017 --> 26:13.520
(knock at door)

26:18.320 --> 26:21.225
Ho. Ho. Ho.

26:22.699 --> 26:23.962
Merry Christmas.

26:23.995 --> 26:25.329
Merry Christmas.

26:30.184 --> 26:31.751
God, this is unbelievable.

26:31.784 --> 26:33.750
(Santana giggles)

26:33.783 --> 26:34.919
I mean...

26:34.952 --> 26:36.151
for struggling actors,

26:36.192 --> 26:39.927
geez, you guys got
a great apartment.

26:42.661 --> 26:43.796
Is that vintage?

26:43.829 --> 26:45.396
Uh-huh, yeah.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.334
- I-I love vintage.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.534
Albums.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.302
KURT: Well, you gotta
have vintage.

26:50.335 --> 26:51.671
- Wow!
- Yep.

26:51.704 --> 26:54.406
So, uh...
you got any tricks

26:54.440 --> 26:56.109
- in that bag, Santa?
- Oh...

26:56.143 --> 26:57.942
Well, you know, I do

26:57.975 --> 26:59.677
do all kinds of parties.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.278
Kids, bachelorette...

27:01.311 --> 27:02.312
bachelor...

27:03.113 --> 27:04.287
Well, let's see.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.319
I got balloons

27:05.352 --> 27:07.016
and helium...

27:07.057 --> 27:09.426
Costumes.

27:09.459 --> 27:10.691
All kinds of stuff.

27:10.724 --> 27:11.995
So how did you guys all meet?

27:12.028 --> 27:13.627
We were in, um,
high school glee club together.

27:13.668 --> 27:14.627
Kurt and I first,

27:14.668 --> 27:15.635
and then...
it's just...

27:15.668 --> 27:17.467
it's complicated.
(laughs)

27:17.500 --> 27:19.268
Glee club, huh?
Mmm.

27:19.301 --> 27:21.070
Do you guys take requests?

27:22.312 --> 27:24.312
'Cause I just thought
of something

27:24.344 --> 27:28.184
truly amazing.

27:28.217 --> 27:30.985
(The Chipmunks' "Christmas

27:31.018 --> 27:32.585

27:32.626 --> 27:33.720

27:33.753 --> 27:34.960
(high-pitched voice):
I'll say we are!

27:34.993 --> 27:36.257
(high-pitched voice):
Yeah, let's sing it now!

27:36.290 --> 27:37.257
Okay, Rachel?

27:37.298 --> 27:38.496

Tickle me.

29:39.197 --> 29:40.229
(giggling)

29:40.262 --> 29:42.333
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

29:42.366 --> 29:43.564
Besides curing cancer

29:43.605 --> 29:44.902
and peace on Earth,
of course.
True.

29:44.935 --> 29:46.741
Hey, Trouty Mouth.

29:46.774 --> 29:48.340
Hey,
Tokyo Rose.

29:48.373 --> 29:49.506
Merry Christmas.

29:55.404 --> 29:58.602
Are these teeth?
(rattles)

29:58.642 --> 30:00.508
Not <i>any</i> teeth.
My baby teeth.

30:00.541 --> 30:01.982
To remind you

30:02.015 --> 30:03.550
of the pure, innocent love

30:03.583 --> 30:04.885
of Baby Jesus.

30:04.918 --> 30:05.884
Thanks, Becky.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.716
That's... very
sweet of you.

30:07.749 --> 30:09.588
We were sorry you
didn't, you know,

30:09.621 --> 30:10.926
win the contest.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.327
Tell me about it.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.558
I'm still recovering from
Coach Sue's critique.

30:15.591 --> 30:18.426
Well, I appreciate your literal
interpretation of "green,"

30:18.459 --> 30:19.997
but it looks like

30:20.029 --> 30:21.100
you fished
all this stuff

30:21.133 --> 30:22.228
right out of
the school Dumpster.

30:22.269 --> 30:24.835
It's recycled!

30:24.868 --> 30:25.836
What it is, is lazy.

30:25.869 --> 30:27.836
Okay, okay.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.475
I wanted to go home

30:29.508 --> 30:32.107
and watch <i>Gigolos</i>
on Showtime.

30:32.140 --> 30:34.474
So I did it half-assed.

30:34.507 --> 30:36.209
I feel like you guys.

30:36.874 --> 30:38.281
Losers.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.586
Anyways, happy holidays.

30:46.391 --> 30:48.390
♪

30:49.527 --> 30:51.492
- I love Christmas.
- Me, too.

30:51.533 --> 30:53.861
- And I love New York.
- Me, too.

30:53.902 --> 30:54.870
You know what?

30:54.903 --> 30:56.805
You should totally
move here.

30:56.838 --> 30:58.100
- No. No way.
- Yeah.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.668
I mean, what about
my scholarship

30:59.701 --> 31:01.340
to the University
of Louisville?

31:01.373 --> 31:02.741
There's no way that
I could just leave

31:02.774 --> 31:04.245
in the middle of
the school year

31:04.278 --> 31:06.446
for no good reason
and come here.

31:06.479 --> 31:08.478
Look, I know that
it's impossible,

31:08.519 --> 31:10.719
but you could, like,
live here with me

31:10.752 --> 31:12.119
and Kurt...

31:12.152 --> 31:13.119
Where?

31:13.152 --> 31:15.223
Where's Kurt?

31:15.256 --> 31:17.159
- Yeah, and Studly Claus?
- Kurt. Kurt?

31:17.192 --> 31:19.293
RACHEL:
Kurt?

31:19.326 --> 31:20.828
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, hell no.

31:20.861 --> 31:23.195
That is not happening.
(squeals)

31:23.228 --> 31:24.732
Oh, don't worry, ladies.

31:24.765 --> 31:25.861
Santa swings both ways.

31:25.902 --> 31:27.030
What?

31:27.071 --> 31:28.101
What's the matter,
Santana?

31:28.134 --> 31:29.100
Jealous?

31:29.133 --> 31:31.302
No, I am disgusted

31:31.335 --> 31:33.241
and also impressed.

31:33.274 --> 31:35.241
Who knew the Queen of England
could be so trashy?

31:35.282 --> 31:36.778
(gasps)
Aren't you the one

31:36.811 --> 31:38.146
who's always calling
me Miss Priss?

31:38.179 --> 31:40.755
And telling me that I need
to live it up a bit?

31:40.788 --> 31:41.987
Well, you're right.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.323
I'm in New York,

31:43.356 --> 31:44.820
I'm single,
I'm available,

31:44.861 --> 31:47.093
and your hot buttered
rum concoction

31:47.126 --> 31:49.533
is dangerously
lowering my inhibitions.

31:50.931 --> 31:52.530
So why not throw caution
to the wind?

31:52.563 --> 31:54.563
In that case,
let's drink up.

31:54.604 --> 31:55.699
Let's do it.

31:55.732 --> 31:57.298
CODY:
Ladies, join us for a toast.

31:57.339 --> 31:59.803
Here's to being naughty
this Christmas.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.939
To being naughty.
Oh...

32:01.972 --> 32:03.874
(Santana laughs)

32:11.975 --> 32:12.975
Santana?

32:15.608 --> 32:17.375
Santana, wake up.

32:17.408 --> 32:18.878
Oh, my God.

32:18.911 --> 32:20.477
(groans)

32:20.510 --> 32:21.812
Oh, my God.

32:21.845 --> 32:23.316
Oh, the last time
I felt like this

32:23.349 --> 32:24.983
was when I was roofied
at Lilith Fair.

32:25.016 --> 32:26.320
Oh, my God.

32:26.353 --> 32:27.656
- Oh, my God, help me up.
- Come here.

32:30.191 --> 32:32.190
(groans)

32:36.696 --> 32:39.167
Oh, my God,
Rachel...

32:39.200 --> 32:41.031
Oh, my God..
Where's all our nice things?

32:41.072 --> 32:42.303
I don't know,
I don't know.

32:42.336 --> 32:43.642
The last thing I remember
was Lady Hummel

32:43.675 --> 32:44.906
bouncing quarters
off of Santa's abs.

32:44.939 --> 32:46.780
(muffled grunt)

32:46.813 --> 32:47.782
- Kurt.
- Kurt.

32:47.815 --> 32:49.485
(grunting)
(gasps)

32:49.518 --> 32:51.317
Oh, my God!

32:51.350 --> 32:52.683
Take that out
of his mouth.

32:52.716 --> 32:53.819
What happened?

32:53.852 --> 32:55.322
Are you okay?
What is this?

32:55.355 --> 32:57.720
It was rough-trade Santa,
that's what happened!

32:57.753 --> 32:59.685
Oh, God!
We were role-playing,

32:59.718 --> 33:01.115
and he wanted
me to be his Rudolph,

33:01.156 --> 33:03.282
and when I said no, well,
he stopped being so jolly.

33:03.323 --> 33:05.088
Oh, God, he took off
his suspenders

33:05.121 --> 33:06.457
and he tied me up.

33:06.490 --> 33:08.522
And-And, well, he did say
it was sexy kissing me

33:08.555 --> 33:10.160
because it was like
I had no teeth.

33:10.193 --> 33:12.298
That's disgusting.
This is disgusting.

33:12.331 --> 33:14.794
But then he just admitted
that-that he was only here

33:14.835 --> 33:16.266
to rob us blind anyway.

33:16.299 --> 33:17.970
Oh, I think I'm
gonna be sick.

33:18.003 --> 33:19.203
(groans)

33:19.236 --> 33:22.607
Wait... Did Kitty
really say she wasn't worthy?

33:22.647 --> 33:24.111
You sure she wasn't just
being snarky?

33:24.144 --> 33:25.544
Or body-snatched?

33:25.584 --> 33:28.385
No. In that moment, she was
totally, like, a real person.

33:28.418 --> 33:30.091
If we can get Kitty to take

33:30.124 --> 33:31.555
the role of the Virgin Mary,
get into

33:31.588 --> 33:32.954
those vestments
and stand in the middle

33:32.995 --> 33:34.162
of that nativity scene

33:34.195 --> 33:35.731
holding the Baby Jesus,
maybe she'll realize

33:35.764 --> 33:37.162
she <i>is</i> worthy,

33:37.195 --> 33:39.465
and she'll stop being
so insanely horrible.

33:39.498 --> 33:41.128
Oh, a Christmas present
to us all.

33:41.161 --> 33:42.697
I tried to offer her
the part,

33:42.730 --> 33:44.338
but she wouldn't
take it.

33:44.371 --> 33:46.635
I know how to
make her take it.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.844
Sam, the Christmas angel
is not like the Stanley Cup.

33:48.877 --> 33:50.180
You can't take it home with you.

33:50.213 --> 33:52.379
Oh, this?
Yeah, um...

33:52.412 --> 33:54.208
we decided
to give it away.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.707
Uh, to Becky. Becky's
like a sad little...

33:56.740 --> 33:59.044
Hermey the Elf waddling
aimlessly into a snow drift,

33:59.077 --> 34:00.977
and we thought
that giving her the angel

34:01.011 --> 34:02.640
might light her up
like Rudolph's nose.

34:02.681 --> 34:04.480
Well, that walks
a dangerously fine line

34:04.514 --> 34:07.019
between being really sweet
and horribly condescending.

34:07.052 --> 34:08.724
Don't worry, Artie, we've got
something else for her, too.

34:10.053 --> 34:11.357
(blows whistle)

34:11.389 --> 34:12.757
Remember, guys, you're
tired, you're hungry

34:12.791 --> 34:14.262
but ironically excited.

34:14.295 --> 34:16.264
All right, dress rehearsal.
Places. Let's go.

34:16.297 --> 34:19.337
KITTY:
Wait, Marley, why aren't
you dressed as the Virgin Mary?

34:19.370 --> 34:21.337
We all decided
that the only girl

34:21.370 --> 34:23.578
who could do the part
justice is...

34:23.612 --> 34:25.411
The black one.

- Yes. All right.

36:46.115 --> 36:48.575
- Not bad, not bad, guys.
Uh, just a few notes.
- Wow.

36:48.615 --> 36:50.510
Um, Ryder,
deliver the baby

36:50.543 --> 36:52.215
- a few bars earlier.
- You got it.

36:52.248 --> 36:53.414
Wait. N-No.

36:53.448 --> 36:55.285
That was
the most sacrilegious

36:55.318 --> 36:59.361
and profane horror show
I have ever seen.

36:59.394 --> 37:00.857
Racist.

37:02.194 --> 37:04.296
Mr. Shue, you cannot let
this abomination happen

37:04.329 --> 37:07.061
to the most beautiful story
ever told.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.799
We have to do this the right way
or not at all.

37:11.232 --> 37:13.136
- I'll play the Virgin Mary.
- WILL: Not so fast.

37:13.169 --> 37:15.643
Um, is that okay
with you, Unique?

37:15.676 --> 37:18.316
Happy holidays.
You get the part.

37:18.349 --> 37:20.116
(cheering)

37:20.149 --> 37:20.948
Oh, Kitty.

37:20.981 --> 37:23.250
Oh!
(chuckles)

37:24.729 --> 37:26.696
(indistinct chatter)

37:32.399 --> 37:34.039
Hey, Becky, there you are.

37:34.072 --> 37:36.837
- Uh, didn't you hear the news?
- What are you talking about?

37:36.870 --> 37:38.571
There was a recount
on the tree decorating contest,

37:38.604 --> 37:40.641
and it turns out
you actually won.

37:40.674 --> 37:43.438
But my tree was a bag
of diapers.

37:43.471 --> 37:44.772
It's Ohio, Becky.
It's a swing state.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.307
You know, the votes
can always go either way.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.475
The point is:
the angel's yours.

37:47.508 --> 37:49.844
Merry Christmas.
Congratulations.

37:49.877 --> 37:52.510
I love you, plastic angel.

37:52.550 --> 37:54.846
Oh, and there's something else.
There's a, um, part left

37:54.887 --> 37:56.785
in the living nativity
that no one else can play.

37:56.818 --> 37:58.322
Do you think
you can help us out?

38:02.699 --> 38:05.327
(groans)
Santana, I feel
like such a fool.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.767
I just wanted to get outside
of myself, you know,

38:07.800 --> 38:10.200
let myself be free for once,
and look what happened.

38:10.233 --> 38:12.032
Everything, including
my collection

38:12.073 --> 38:14.504
of Broadway Playbills,
was stolen.

38:14.537 --> 38:16.336
(sighs)
I've never felt so ashamed.

38:16.376 --> 38:17.805
That's why I could
never live here.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.107
Bushwick is worse
than Lima Heights.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.308
You can't tell
anyone about this.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.909
Even though Blaine
and I are broken up,

38:21.942 --> 38:24.246
you can never tell
him. Promise me.
I promise.

38:24.279 --> 38:27.185
RACHEL:
Hey. Okay, so I just
got back from the mall.

38:27.218 --> 38:30.386
Turns out that Cody
ransacked Santa Land as well.

38:30.426 --> 38:33.257
He even took all of the money
from the Salvation Army bucket.

38:33.290 --> 38:35.424
The police said that we were
lucky that we weren't hurt.

38:35.457 --> 38:37.390
(scoffs)
Uh...
<i>More</i> hurt.

38:37.423 --> 38:39.725
But, needless to say,
our services at the Midtown Mall

38:39.758 --> 38:40.926
are no longer required.

38:40.967 --> 38:42.737
(sighs)
This is gonna follow us.

38:42.770 --> 38:45.202
The fact that we were fired from
our jobs as Christmas elves

38:45.235 --> 38:47.213
is gonna be a black mark
on our acting résumés

38:47.246 --> 38:49.216
- for the rest of our lives.
- Not if we have

38:49.249 --> 38:51.281
something else to make up
for it, which I do.

38:51.322 --> 38:53.489
So, I was getting off
of the subway and I was passing

38:53.522 --> 38:55.550
Fifth Avenue...
No, Rachel, another one
of your crazy jobs?

38:55.583 --> 38:56.990
We barely survived
the first one.

38:57.023 --> 38:59.254
Trust me, Santana. This job
will not only test our mettle

38:59.287 --> 39:01.422
as performers, but we will be
protected by the safety

39:01.463 --> 39:02.790
of bulletproof glass.

39:05.598 --> 39:07.894
This is obviously myrrh,
not frankincense.

39:07.935 --> 39:09.734
- No, no, no.
That's-that's frankincense.
- Um...

39:09.767 --> 39:12.205
(overlapping arguing)
Guys, can we just talk about
how great everybody looks?

39:12.238 --> 39:14.269
Look at you guys. You guys
look phenomenal. Where's Becky?

39:14.302 --> 39:17.941
BECKY: This hay is making me
have a rash.

39:17.974 --> 39:20.711
BLAINE:
Becky, you're a genius!

39:20.744 --> 39:22.551
- Genius!
- All you have to do is just kneel right here.

39:22.584 --> 39:23.983
- It's gonna look perfect.
- Yes!

39:24.016 --> 39:25.648
- You look amazing.
- Great job!

39:25.669 --> 39:27.074
How did you think of that?

39:27.120 --> 39:28.855
Kitty...

39:28.888 --> 39:31.159
Virgin in the house,
bitches.

39:31.192 --> 39:32.654
You look beautiful.

39:32.687 --> 39:35.662
(cheering)

39:35.696 --> 39:38.199
