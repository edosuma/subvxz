05:12.120 --> 05:14.236
<i>Thiobacillus,</i> which,

05:15.560 --> 05:18.518
William, is a remarkable bacterium
because...

05:18.600 --> 05:20.989
It's the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.230
That's right, and...

05:23.320 --> 05:26.392
- Yes, Miss Rouhani?
<i>- Deinococcus radiodurans.</i>

05:26.480 --> 05:30.234
First discovered in 1956, breeding
inside drums of radioactive waste.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.232
That's correct. So, <i>pompejana,</i>
<i>Thiobacillus, Deinococcus.</i>

05:33.320 --> 05:35.675
Which of these three
would most likely survive

05:35.760 --> 05:40.007
in the extreme environment of the
Jupiter moon Callisto, and why?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.479
Tom, can you get the lights, please?

05:41.560 --> 05:42.913
That's your lab report question
for this week,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.719
and it's due in my box
by midnight on Friday.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.234
That's all for today. Thank you.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.919
So, are you coming
to the faculty conference tonight?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.319
To listen to Dean Stoff lecture

05:55.400 --> 05:57.789
about how the universe
is like a beautiful woman?

05:59.160 --> 06:02.038
- Think I'll pass.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.989
- Uh-uh.
- I could pick you up.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.075
Um...

06:08.160 --> 06:12.790
Can't. I have to get back
to my own extreme environment.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.869
But thank you.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.791
- See you tomorrow.
- Yep.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.232
Come on. Go.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.595
Jacob?
- Go, go!

06:31.920 --> 06:34.070
Come on, come on.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.151
- Yes!
- Jacob, dinner.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.399
- You finished your homework?
- Yes. You just killed me.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.630
Good. Now that you're dead,
you can shut that off

06:47.720 --> 06:49.278
and come down for dinner.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.634
Did you order pepperoni tonight?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.790
- No. Are these clean?
- Yeah.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.199
We've had pizza twice this week,

06:54.280 --> 06:57.795
so I made you a proper meal tonight,
with vegetables.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.757
Vegetables? Ew.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.990
Stop being such a stepmom.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.876
Where'd you get this?

07:07.480 --> 07:09.038
It was Dad's.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.715
Yeah, I know. Where was it?

07:12.200 --> 07:15.636
I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
It's mine now.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.554
Okay.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.153
Okay. Come on,
I said please shut that off.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.958
- You didn't say "please."
- Jacob.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.473
Helen.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.999
- Hello?
<i>- Helen Benson?</i>

07:35.080 --> 07:37.355
- Yes.
<i>- Dr. Helen Benson?</i>

07:37.440 --> 07:40.671
<i>- You're at 106 Longwood Road?</i>
- Who is this?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.512
<i>Someone should be there shortly.</i>

07:42.600 --> 07:45.672
What do you mean,
someone's coming here? Who is this?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.832
<i>Everything will be</i>
<i>explained to you en route.</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:51.078
En route where?

07:52.480 --> 07:54.914
- Hello?
<i>- They should be there soon.</i>

07:55.000 --> 07:56.433
<i>Yes, they're at your door now.</i>

07:59.280 --> 08:01.032
Hold on a minute.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.554
Dr. Benson, if you'll come with us...

08:08.640 --> 08:10.232
- What's happening?
- Everything will be explained,

08:10.320 --> 08:12.788
but you must come with us right away.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.872
- Am I under arrest?
- You're in Federal custody.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.632
Why?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.473
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained en route.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.549
I have a child here.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.915
Is there anyone
who can look after the boy?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.479
- No.
- Can his father take care of him?

08:25.560 --> 08:26.879
No, his father isn't here.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.599
- I can take care of myself.
- Jacob, you can't take care of yourself.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.671
- There's just no way...
- You're coming with us, Dr. Benson.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.034
Helen?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.837
Jacob, grab your coat.
You're gonna stay at Isabel's.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.559
Attention, Bravo,
prepare to move out.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.229
It's going to be okay.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.834
Dr. Benson, there isn't much time.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.989
Okay, we've got her. Let's go.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.355
Two stoplights down, then left,
there's an on-ramp to the highway.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.271
- Do you see it?
- This must be a mistake.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.670
Helen Benson,
Social Security number 51-48-7843?

09:23.760 --> 09:24.795
- Yeah.
- There's no mistake.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.269
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.349
Stop the car.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.112
- Can you stop the car, please?
- Ma'am.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.077
I'm not under arrest. You can't do this.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.674
- This is a matter of national security.
- National security?

09:34.760 --> 09:36.318
Well, that just means
whatever you want it to mean.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.358
I'm just asking you to tell me
why I'm needed, or to let me go.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.000
Ma'am, I can't tell you
why you're needed because I don't know.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.479
But I know they need you,
and I know it's urgent.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.437
How do you know that?

09:50.640 --> 09:52.073
Where are all the cars?

09:52.160 --> 09:55.152
- They shut down the highway.
- They shut it down?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.992
- For what?
- For us.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.440
- Hi. I'm Yusef.
- Helen.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.673
Helen, do you have any idea
why this is happening to us?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.398
- No.
- Well, think.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.959
What do we have in common?

10:51.040 --> 10:53.156
- What do you do for a living, Yusef?
- I'm a nuclear physicist.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.673
- I'm an astronomer.
- A geologist.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.035
- I'm an astrobiologist.
- Fossil record study?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.634
No, microbiology.
Theories of life beyond Earth.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.395
- All right, so we're all scientists.
- No, not me. I'm a civil engineer.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.879
Put it all together. What do you get?

11:04.960 --> 11:07.758
I've participated in government
mobilizations like this before.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.432
War games and preparations
for certain scenarios...

11:09.520 --> 11:11.556
- Is that what you think this is?
- No.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.995
Whatever it is, it's not a game.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.639
Your attention, please!

11:50.720 --> 11:54.030
Make your way directly across
the courtyard to the main barracks.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.839
Leave all your cell phones
and cameras here.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.708
I repeat, cell phones
and cameras are not allowed inside.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.756
Leave any cell phones and cameras here.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.239
Helen!

12:05.440 --> 12:06.759
Can we bring her up?

12:06.840 --> 12:08.239
you need to give up
your cell phones...

12:08.320 --> 12:09.639
Your attention, please...
- Thank you.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.712
...make your way directly across
the courtyard to the main barracks...

12:12.800 --> 12:13.915
- Helen.
- Hi, Michael.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.479
- Been a long time.
- Are you behind all this?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.312
Yes. I'm glad you came.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.073
- It's not like I had a choice.
- Sorry about that.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.673
I had you put on the "vital" list.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.352
I thought it was important
to have you part of this team.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.475
Why?

12:24.560 --> 12:27.358
I've been keeping up with the work you've
been doing with Professor Barnhardt.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.078
What does it have to do with this?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.832
I'll have to crash-brief you
in the conference room.

12:35.360 --> 12:40.718
Object 07/493 was first spotted
just beyond Jupiter's orbit

12:40.800 --> 12:42.677
by the Spaceguard program.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.878
It was notable for the fact that it was
not moving in an asteroidal ellipse,

12:46.960 --> 12:49.235
but rather, it had a hyperbolic orbit

12:49.320 --> 12:52.756
and was shooting
through our solar system.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.990
The object was moving at speeds

12:55.080 --> 12:58.550
of up to three times 10-to-the-seventh
meters per second.

12:58.640 --> 13:03.316
At first, it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of Earth's orbit.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.675
However, we soon discovered
that the object

13:05.760 --> 13:09.514
was not following
a gravitationally freefall trajectory.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.957
As such, its path was recalculated.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.030
It was at this time
a crisis response team was activated

13:22.120 --> 13:24.315
and everything you see around you
was set in motion.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.711
Can we launch a missile to intercept it?

13:30.800 --> 13:34.270
The military is attempting to do just that.
In fact, they may launch several.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.033
But, given the speed
at which this object is moving,

13:37.120 --> 13:40.510
our chances of success are slim, at best.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.318
Why don't they evacuate the area?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.992
We simply do not have enough time.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.675
The affected area contains
some 8 million inhabitants.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.196
The best we can do
is to plan for the aftermath.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.157
How long do we have?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.518
Seventy-eight minutes.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.117
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>What did the cops want, anyway?</i>

14:06.640 --> 14:12.556
Well, there's going to be
a big storm tonight,

14:12.640 --> 14:16.076
and they needed some scientists
to help out, you know,

14:16.960 --> 14:20.509
with planning stuff. So...

14:22.560 --> 14:25.677
Pretty soon you're all gonna
go down to the basement, okay?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.954
I already told Isabel.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.632
<i>I haven't seen anything on TVabout...</i>

14:28.720 --> 14:30.312
Jacob, just...

14:31.720 --> 14:33.631
Just do it. All right?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.911
<i>All right. I should go.</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:40.152
Wait... Can we talk just a little bit longer?

14:40.760 --> 14:43.718
<i>We're having dinner now.</i>
<i>I really should go.</i>

14:44.920 --> 14:47.388
You know I love you very much.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.311
<i>Okay. Bye, Helen.</i>

14:57.400 --> 14:59.675
Is that a cell phone?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.119
Can I borrow it?

15:12.720 --> 15:15.393
What are the odds of an asteroid
making impact in Manhattan?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.516
Astronomical.
Plus, there's no light signature.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.749
Then it can't be an asteroid.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.354
- A primordial black hole, perhaps.
- Do you know what that would mean?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.590
Look, whatever it is,
if this object is moving

15:23.680 --> 15:25.910
at three times 10-to-the-seventh
meters per second,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.956
there will be no aftermath.

15:28.040 --> 15:32.750
If they can't stop it before it hits,
there will be nothing left but dust.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.913
It will sterilize the Earth.
This is all theater.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.513
They're saying we lost launch capability.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.830
What? How?
- What does that mean?

15:40.920 --> 15:43.309
- The missile's disabled.
- Disabled by what?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.755
- They don't know.
- But they can restore it, right?

15:45.840 --> 15:48.752
There's a fallback. They have to launch.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.956
Object impact in seven, six...

15:57.040 --> 15:58.996
"Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.230
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven...

16:01.320 --> 16:04.118
...three, two, one...
- "...Give us this day..."

16:12.400 --> 16:14.391
- Where is it?
- Could they have made a mistake?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.869
Wait! Roger that.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.030
They're saying
the object's still in its approach.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.270
Well, then, where is it?
- It's slowing down.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.759
Awesome.
- Slowing down?

16:22.840 --> 16:24.239
I see it.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.871
Radiation levels are slightly elevated,
but it's not dangerous.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.599
I'm getting a lot of
electrostatic interference.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.238
Yeah, me too.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.672
Did you feel that?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.233
Feel what?

18:45.840 --> 18:47.273
I feel it.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.879
It's close.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.555
Checkmate 0-6,
who has tactical command here?

19:59.640 --> 20:02.791
This is 2917. I need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site.

20:45.400 --> 20:49.518
<i>Checkmate 0-3,</i>
<i>this is Gator 2-3. We're blind here.</i>

20:49.600 --> 20:52.592
<i>Checkmate 0-6,</i>
<i>do you copy? Over.</i>

20:56.480 --> 20:57.993
<i>What the hell is that thing?</i>

20:58.080 --> 21:00.071
<i>I need the rules of engagement now.</i>

21:00.160 --> 21:01.878
<i>Target is advancing.</i>

21:01.960 --> 21:05.157
<i>Target is advancing.</i>
<i>Repeat, target is advancing.</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:12.514
<i>Sniper team is in place.</i>

21:13.120 --> 21:16.396
<i>Sniper team leaders, come back. I repeat...</i>

21:20.040 --> 21:22.076
<i>Do not fire!</i>
- It's coming right at us!

21:22.160 --> 21:23.752
<i>It's coming out!</i>

21:23.840 --> 21:26.274
<i>Hold your fire!</i>
<i>- Do we engage?</i>

21:27.200 --> 21:29.031
<i>Hold your fire!</i>
<i>- Fire!</i>

21:32.560 --> 21:34.915
- Cease fire!
- All stations, cease fire!

21:35.000 --> 21:37.434
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

21:45.800 --> 21:47.233
We need a medic!

22:36.920 --> 22:39.992
<i> Klaatu barada nikto!</i>

23:09.480 --> 23:12.597
We need that DNA swab. DNA swab now!

23:12.680 --> 23:15.399
- It's soaking through.
- Where's the O2? Stat.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.436
Get me the O2, stat.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.397
Go. No one else!

23:32.040 --> 23:33.837
What am I supposed to do now?
Do I start an IV?

23:33.920 --> 23:36.912
No, no. We don't know its physiology.
For all we know, the fluids may kill it.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.433
What do I do, then?
What do I do?

23:38.520 --> 23:40.112
Its blood is red.
It must have hemoglobin.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.158
- Okay, she's right. Start the drip.
- Okay. I... I can't find a vein.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.959
- It doesn't have any veins!
- Look for a central line site, then.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.234
Going into cardiac arrest!
Do I defib?

23:47.320 --> 23:50.118
- Yeah, get in there now. Go! Go!
- Clear!

23:53.440 --> 23:56.318
- The monitor just shorted out!
- Heart rate is stabilizing! It's stabilizing.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.470
What now? What now?

24:01.120 --> 24:03.076
Do you have a surgeon?

24:04.960 --> 24:08.839
Normally, for a gunshot,
we'd be using a general anesthetic.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.156
But, as we don't know
how the patient will react,

24:14.440 --> 24:18.149
I have opted for a local.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.155
I'm making the first incision now.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.752
No explosions. So far, so good.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.593
Pale flesh,

24:34.720 --> 24:37.359
a texture something akin to...

24:38.720 --> 24:39.914
What?

24:40.360 --> 24:42.112
Whale blubber.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.997
I'm taking a specimen now.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.517
Pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for DNA mapping.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.511
I'd like a sample of that as well.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.115
I am entering the wound, and...

24:57.440 --> 24:58.839
My God.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.358
What is this?

25:02.440 --> 25:05.079
I'm sorry. I'm a little taken aback.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.668
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
- Nothing's wrong.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.354
That's the thing. It's all so familiar.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.149
The outer layer of the flesh is exotic,
it's strange,

25:14.240 --> 25:18.552
but as I go deeper,
there's muscle, vein, nerve, bone.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.593
I'm extracting the bullet.

25:29.600 --> 25:34.913
This gray flesh,
it seems to be just falling away.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.310
It's... It's removing itself.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.033
I think I need to keep extracting it.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.512
<i>Yes. Continue.</i>

25:47.160 --> 25:49.355
Can you explain any of this?

26:42.240 --> 26:43.753
It's dreaming.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.831
Any signs of neural activity?

26:46.920 --> 26:49.718
It lit up the fMRI like Times Square.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.593
Get help.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.468
Code white! Subject is conscious!

27:01.040 --> 27:02.473
Help!

27:09.200 --> 27:12.397
It's looking at you.
Try saying something to it.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.758
My name is Dr. Helen Benson.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.158
We're trying to help you.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.549
You have nothing to fear from us.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.073
Help you.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.672
Nothing to fear.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.040
<i>Global markets are</i>
<i>panicked in early trading this morning</i>

27:29.120 --> 27:31.156
<i>in response to the crisis in Central Park.</i>

27:31.240 --> 27:33.629
<i>Trading has been halted</i>
<i>on the New York Stock Exchange,</i>

27:33.720 --> 27:37.349
<i>the Nikkei and Hang Seng, as Manhattan</i>
<i>prepares for a massive evacuation.</i>

27:37.440 --> 27:38.919
<i>In other cities around the world,</i>

27:39.000 --> 27:42.037
<i>people are voluntarily evacuating</i>
<i>population centers,</i>

27:42.120 --> 27:43.997
<i>fearing that the sphere in Central Park</i>

27:44.080 --> 27:46.310
<i>may be the vanguard</i>
<i>of an impending alien invasion.</i>

27:46.400 --> 27:49.870
The President and Vice President have
been taken to separate, secure locations.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.633
Until this situation
has some kind of resolve,

27:52.720 --> 27:55.678
I am the eyes and the ears
of the Presidency.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.398
So, what do we know?

27:57.480 --> 27:59.311
Madam Secretary, we lost contact

27:59.400 --> 28:02.073
with one of our DSCS-3
listening satellites orbiting Earth.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.195
What is that image?

28:03.280 --> 28:05.350
Are you saying that sphere
in Central Park isn't the only one?

28:05.440 --> 28:07.271
In fact, we have intelligence
that smaller spheres

28:07.360 --> 28:09.476
have landed at other locations
around the world.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.993
Do we have briefings on that?
And, General,

28:11.080 --> 28:13.196
where exactly
are these spheres right now?

28:13.280 --> 28:16.272
I think we're asking the wrong questions.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.237
What questions should we be asking?

28:18.320 --> 28:20.550
Well, let's start with this.
Where is our satellite?

28:20.640 --> 28:22.073
We lost contact with it.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.957
In the scheme of things,
the loss of one satellite

28:24.040 --> 28:26.076
- isn't necessarily our concern.
- DSCS-3

28:26.160 --> 28:28.879
stands for "Defense Systems
Communication Satellite."

28:28.960 --> 28:30.791
Remember what it communicates with?

28:30.880 --> 28:33.758
They were able to access our
defense mainframe via that satellite.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.035
That's how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses

28:36.120 --> 28:37.155
and entered our airspace.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.834
We've changed all the codes.
- And on top of that,

28:39.920 --> 28:43.230
there is a vast amount
of vital intelligence on that mainframe.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.515
They know everything about us now.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.273
- And we know nothing about them.
- Almost nothing.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.157
The fact that they chose
to disable our defenses

28:50.240 --> 28:52.595
tells us something about their intentions.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.071
Madam Secretary,
we brought in several specialists

28:59.160 --> 29:01.310
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.119
This is our chief geneticist,
Dr. Hideo Ikegawa.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.236
This is our chief astrobiologist,
Dr. Helen Benson.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.958
- Hello.
- Doctor?

29:08.720 --> 29:10.836
The being is in a nascent state.

29:10.920 --> 29:15.038
The DNA samples we've taken seem
to represent three distinct life forms.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.636
- Three different DNA types?
- Yes, including the being's brain.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.110
The body tissue is human,
as far as we can tell.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.428
The gray flesh encasing it

29:24.520 --> 29:28.559
is organic material,
some kind of bioengineered spacesuit.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.757
What it resembles, oddly enough,
is placental tissue.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.957
Which makes sense, given the placenta's
a life-support system.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.190
And that, basically,
in order to survive in our environment,

29:37.280 --> 29:40.829
the being had to be born here,
in its human form.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.194
They must have come here in the past

29:42.280 --> 29:45.397
and obtained a DNA sample
from a human subject.

29:45.480 --> 29:49.268
Now, since that birth,
the being has grown exponentially.

29:49.960 --> 29:52.315
This is one hour after surgery.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.559
Three hours.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.514
Six hours.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.751
How much can you tell us about it
by decoding its DNA?

30:00.840 --> 30:03.991
You don't understand.
These are the Dead Sea Scrolls.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.469
Geneticists are gonna be
studying this code for generations.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.595
No, they aren't.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.716
This code is the property
of the US government.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.712
Its very existence is classified.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.869
I want to see it.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.594
Water.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.429
Bring him up.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.399
Does it actually speak our language?
Or does it just parrot what it's heard?

30:32.480 --> 30:35.517
No, it seems to already
understand our language.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.875
They've compromised our satellites.
They know everything about us.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.473
Mr. Driscoll.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.035
My name is Regina Jackson.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.033
I'm the Secretary of Defense
of the United States of America.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.438
This body will take some getting used to.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.112
I've been sent here to determine
who or what you represent,

31:24.200 --> 31:26.475
and what your intentions are.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.591
It feels unreal to me.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.039
Alien.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.315
It will take time to adapt.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.999
What were you before you were human?

31:47.320 --> 31:48.912
Different.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.558
Different how?

31:51.480 --> 31:53.596
It would only frighten you.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.239
Do you have a name?

31:58.240 --> 31:59.673
Klaatu.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.669
Do you represent a civilization?

32:06.880 --> 32:09.917
I represent a group of civilizations.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.434
Where is this group of civilizations?

32:12.520 --> 32:14.476
All around you.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.835
What is your purpose in coming here?

32:16.920 --> 32:20.549
There is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.074
I will explain my purpose to them.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.720
I'm afraid that's not possible.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.712
Perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.598
Do you speak for the entire human race?

32:31.680 --> 32:34.877
I speak for
the President of the United States.

32:37.120 --> 32:41.193
Now, please, tell me,
why have you come to our planet?

32:43.840 --> 32:45.398
Your planet?

32:45.480 --> 32:47.835
Yes. This is our planet.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.197
No. It is not.

32:53.240 --> 32:57.028
We've decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.554
- Are you going to interrogate him?
- That's a possibility.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.791
Madam Secretary, as scientists,
we can't consent to this.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.235
He says he wants to speak to the UN.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.072
History has lessons to teach us

33:07.160 --> 33:10.118
about first encounters
between civilizations.

33:10.200 --> 33:14.352
As a rule, the less advanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved.

33:14.440 --> 33:18.991
I'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas,
Columbus and the Native Americans...

33:19.080 --> 33:20.798
The list goes on.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.998
Unfortunately, in this case,
the less advanced civilization is us.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.516
This is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.637
This is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.837
It may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.718
We need to know what they're planning,
and we need to know now.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.031
So you want to drug him?
Interrogate him?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.475
I'm sorry, we won't do that.
Do you understand?

33:43.560 --> 33:45.676
I understand completely.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.274
Of course, if you won't do it,
we'll have to call in someone who will.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.396
Well, I'm sure
you can find someone who will...

33:50.480 --> 33:51.959
I'll do it.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.159
Helen.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.639
I'll do it.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.194
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.237
We've already prepared
the solution for you.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.951
I just need a syringe.

34:39.920 --> 34:44.152
I want to apologize to you.
It seems we got off to a bad start.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.752
It seems we did.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.034
We're going to transport you
to a different facility

34:49.120 --> 34:52.078
- for better medical care.
- No, you are not.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.989
- Excuse me?
- I am leaving.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.279
I can't allow you to do that.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.989
- It is not up to you.
- This is a military installation.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.389
You're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.833
There's no leaving here.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.399
I have done nothing wrong.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.835
You invaded our airspace.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.878
That automaton
that emerged from the sphere,

35:11.960 --> 35:13.279
it attacked our troops.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.191
It acted to defend me.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.714
It activates in the presence of violence.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.597
Dr. Benson? Please.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.913
Run.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.953
It's done.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.109
If you'll come with us, ma'am...

36:11.680 --> 36:13.477
Keep moving, please.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.590
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.717
Are you currently in a seated position?

37:13.720 --> 37:15.153
Yes.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.719
Are you human?

37:18.480 --> 37:19.913
My body is.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.198
Do you feel pain?

37:24.360 --> 37:25.839
My body does.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.316
Are you aware of an impending attack

37:34.240 --> 37:36.151
on the planet Earth?

37:39.560 --> 37:41.471
You should let me go.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.676
I'll repeat the question.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.598
What gate did you use to enter this base?

38:17.680 --> 38:18.999
East loading door.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.116
How do I get there?

38:21.200 --> 38:24.158
One hundred yards left
from the back of this building.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.310
Is there a security code?

38:28.040 --> 38:30.349
Four-four-Bravo-three-zero.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.354
What size is that suit?

38:33.440 --> 38:35.078
Forty-two long.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.559
Take it off.

39:14.240 --> 39:16.151
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>All security personnel</i>

39:16.240 --> 39:18.037
<i>report to your designated posts.</i>

39:18.120 --> 39:21.715
<i>All civilian personnel</i>
<i>report to Operations immediately.</i>

39:31.240 --> 39:33.879
- I'm leaving you now.
- No.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.798
Put every arm of the government,

40:02.880 --> 40:06.714
military, law enforcement,
Federal, state and local, on high alert.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.234
- If the media gets word that we lost...
- Use a cover story.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.878
We can't risk a panic.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.518
Call him an escaped convict.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.797
Use every surveillance satellite,
every drone aircraft,

40:15.880 --> 40:18.997
every freeway camera.
Use every resource we've got.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.033
<i>Attention:</i>
<i>All scheduled trains</i>

40:28.120 --> 40:31.078

41:20.400 --> 41:23.710
You're not getting the ticket.
All right, back off!

41:23.800 --> 41:26.633
- Don't push me. I want the ticket.
- Look, I don't...

41:26.720 --> 41:29.678
- Now just give me the ticket!
- I'm not giving you anything!

41:29.760 --> 41:32.638
Give me the...
What's the matter with you?

41:47.920 --> 41:50.753
<i>Rising global unrest</i>
<i>is causing leaders around the world</i>

41:50.840 --> 41:54.150
<i>to criticize the US response</i>
<i>to the arrival of the spheres.</i>

41:54.240 --> 41:56.390
<i>Reactions from both</i>
<i>national and international</i>

41:56.480 --> 41:58.152
<i>religious communities have been varied.</i>

41:58.240 --> 42:00.674
<i>While some have responded</i>
<i>with hope and measured optimism,</i>

42:00.760 --> 42:04.355
<i>most religious communities have</i>
<i>considered recent events as apocalyptic.</i>

42:04.440 --> 42:07.398
<i>At gatherings and prayer vigils</i>
<i>in virtually every major city,</i>

42:07.480 --> 42:10.040
<i>many see the arrival</i>
<i>of the Central Park sphere</i>

42:10.120 --> 42:13.192
<i>as a sign of a new era,</i>
<i>or perhaps even the end of the world.</i>

42:14.000 --> 42:17.436
<i>The rapture, the tribulation</i>
<i>and the impending battle of Armageddon</i>

42:17.520 --> 42:19.909
<i>dominate much of the discussion.</i>

42:34.520 --> 42:36.988
<i>Leaders around the world</i>
<i>are protesting the US's decision</i>

42:37.080 --> 42:40.789
<i>to deny foreign scientists</i>
<i>full access to the being.</i>

42:40.880 --> 42:42.598
Have you done your homework?

42:42.680 --> 42:45.194
School's canceled on account of the aliens.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.794
- They say it's an invasion.
- Well, they're wrong.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.269
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

42:51.520 --> 42:52.794
Don't get that!

42:52.880 --> 42:54.632
- Jacob!
- Hello?

42:54.720 --> 42:57.234
<i>May I speak</i>
<i>to Dr. Helen Benson, please?</i>

42:57.320 --> 42:58.799
It's for you.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.798
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Helen Benson?</i>

43:03.880 --> 43:06.440
- Yes.
<i>- I'm calling from Newark Penn Station.</i>

43:06.520 --> 43:08.750
<i>We've got your patient here.</i>

43:08.960 --> 43:10.359
Oh, um...

43:10.440 --> 43:14.718
Sorry, I think there's been a mistake.
I'm not that kind of a doctor.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.916
<i>Hold... Hold on a second.</i>

43:17.520 --> 43:19.476
<i>He says you got his medicine.</i>

43:22.080 --> 43:23.479
I'll be right there.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.596
<i>and stressed</i>
<i>the need for calm and understanding...</i>

43:32.200 --> 43:34.316
Sorry. Excuse me?

43:34.400 --> 43:37.437
Excuse me! I'm sorry, someone
called me. My name's Dr. Benson.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.476
Okay, he's over there.
He's your problem now.

43:39.560 --> 43:42.313
Go ahead, take him. He's your problem.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.837
<i>Evacuation registration point</i>
<i>is located two blocks this way.</i>

43:57.920 --> 44:01.708
You know, I took a huge risk
back at the hospital.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.711
Did I make a mistake?

44:04.480 --> 44:06.755
Are you a friend to us?

44:06.840 --> 44:08.956
I'm a friend to the Earth.

44:11.640 --> 44:15.155
Let's keep it steady, folks.
Let's keep going forward.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.788
Hello.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.472
Hi.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.993
Okay.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.035
- Now what?
- Drive.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.557
Look in your pocket.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.191
Your inside pocket.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.873
Turn left.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.990
<i>Striker 2829,</i>
<i>descend and maintain 2,000</i>

45:41.080 --> 45:43.196
<i>to established vectors to the target area.</i>

45:43.320 --> 45:45.675
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.596
All right, everybody, we got our mission!

45:48.680 --> 45:51.592
All right, target acquired and
confirmed, sir. We are locked on.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.399
Madam Secretary,
they're sending in the drones.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.516
Bring in the Reapers! We have go!

45:56.600 --> 46:00.479
- Roger that! Descending to 1,200.
- Let's light this thing up.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.875
Arm your Sidewinder missiles!

46:13.320 --> 46:15.914
Roger that, Colonel.
Sidewinder missiles armed.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.113
- He's activating!
- Fire! Fire, fire!

46:32.120 --> 46:34.509
- Missiles intercepted!
- Get out of there!

46:34.600 --> 46:36.352
Withdraw and realign
for another sortie!

46:36.440 --> 46:39.591
Negative! I've lost link! I've lost control!

46:42.000 --> 46:44.719
Who's in control of the aircraft, then?

46:46.080 --> 46:49.755
Striker 28 headed for orb perimeter!
I am out of control!

46:59.080 --> 47:00.832
Anyone got any other ideas?

47:03.720 --> 47:07.076
Why are people running?
We should stay and fight.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.390
They didn't come here to hurt us.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.836
Well, we should kill them anyway,
just to make sure.

47:13.920 --> 47:17.435
Don't say that.
- That's what Dad would have done.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.909
I think he would have looked
for a different way.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.275
He would have fought.

47:22.360 --> 47:27.036
- I like to think I knew him pretty well.
- I knew him, too. Longer than you.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.638
What do you think?

47:29.720 --> 47:31.039
Of what?

47:31.120 --> 47:34.430
Should people run,
or should we stay and fight?

47:34.520 --> 47:37.114
- Neither.
- What should we do, then?

47:37.800 --> 47:39.995
There's nothing you can do.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.953
This is it. Pull in here.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.193
McDonald's?

47:57.520 --> 48:00.512
Where are you going?
Jacob, where are you going?

48:00.600 --> 48:02.272
To the bathroom!

48:06.000 --> 48:08.230
Where is the boy's father?

48:10.120 --> 48:11.519
He's dead.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.071
How did he die?

48:14.160 --> 48:16.037
He was in the Army.

48:16.920 --> 48:21.869
So the boy wishes his soldier father were
here to rescue the world from the aliens.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.838
The boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons,

48:24.920 --> 48:27.275
aliens being the least of them.

48:29.680 --> 48:34.310
He wasn't even that kind of a soldier.
He was an engineer.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.598
He went over there to build, not to fight.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.432
And his mother?

48:41.840 --> 48:44.115
She died when he was a baby.

48:45.240 --> 48:49.631
I married his father.
A year ago, he was killed.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.271
Why did you come here?

48:56.440 --> 48:58.715
I came to save the Earth.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.279
From what?

49:01.920 --> 49:03.353
He's here.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.718
Your tea, Grandfather.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.678
Thank you.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.550
Are you one of them?

49:31.640 --> 49:33.073
One of who?

49:35.480 --> 49:36.515
Never mind. Sorry.

49:37.760 --> 49:40.115
You've been out of
contact for a long time.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.553
I had a dangerous assignment.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.430
This is hostile territory.

49:45.960 --> 49:46.949
I've noticed.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.351
I was hoping I could reason with them.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.400
I'm afraid they are not a reasonable race.

49:54.760 --> 49:58.435
I've been living amongst them
for seventy years now.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.238
I know them well.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.509
And?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.753
Any attempt to intercede with
them would be futile.

50:06.360 --> 50:08.351
They are destructive,

50:09.040 --> 50:11.076
and they won't change.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.872
Is that your official report?

50:16.040 --> 50:20.909
The tragedy is, they know
what's going to become of them.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.597
They sense it.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.908
But they can't seem
to do anything about it.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.749
It's decided then.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.480
I'll begin the process as soon as possible.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.669
We should make preparations
for our departure.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.719
I'm staying.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.317
You can't stay here.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.751
I can, and I will.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.828
- If you stay, you'll die.
- I know.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.677
This is my home now.

50:58.360 --> 51:01.352
You yourself called them
a destructive race.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.919
That's true.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.474
But, still, there is another side.

51:08.040 --> 51:11.032
You see, I... I love them.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.749
This is a very strange thing.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.716
I can't find a way to explain it to you. I...

51:20.800 --> 51:25.032
For many years, I...
I cursed my luck for being sent here.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.476
Human life is difficult.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.953
But as this life is coming to an end,

51:34.200 --> 51:38.113
I consider myself lucky to have lived it.

51:43.400 --> 51:48.235
No sudden movements. No aggressive
actions. No matter what happens,

51:48.320 --> 51:49.594
no gunfire.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.353
Track is in place, sir.
Containment panels are in position.

51:52.440 --> 51:55.432
- We're ready on your order.
- On my command,

51:56.360 --> 51:58.271
move the panels into place.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.999
- Three, two...
<i>- Three, two...</i>

52:01.520 --> 52:02.509
...one.

52:02.600 --> 52:05.512
<i>Synchronize established,</i>
<i>ISI ready to copy.</i>

52:14.440 --> 52:19.116
<i>Containment panels</i>
<i>are secure, and we're still here.</i>

52:27.800 --> 52:28.869
<i>9-1-1.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

52:28.960 --> 52:30.439
<i>The escaped convict</i>
<i>they showed on the news,</i>

52:30.520 --> 52:33.080
<i>- I just saw the guy at the gas station.</i>
<i>- Can you describe him?</i>

52:33.160 --> 52:34.718
<i>He was in a little car,</i>
<i>on the south block...</i>

52:34.800 --> 52:36.279
<i>9- 1-1, what is your emergency?</i>

52:36.360 --> 52:38.112
<i>I just saw that wanted man</i>
<i>over by the McDonald's.</i>

52:38.200 --> 52:39.394
<i> Can you</i>
<i>describe the car, sir?</i>

52:39.480 --> 52:40.833
<i>Silver four-door,</i>
<i>with a woman and a kid.</i>

52:40.920 --> 52:43.593
<i>I need 3 units to look</i>
<i>for a silver Honda near Ochada orchards.</i>

52:43.680 --> 52:46.114
<i>3-1 responding.</i>
<i>We are patrolling the orchards off I-67.</i>

52:46.200 --> 52:47.872
<i>HP-28, follow up.</i>

52:48.880 --> 52:52.236
This is it. Stop here.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.677
You shouldn't...

53:00.480 --> 53:03.233
Uh, Helen? Who is this guy?

53:03.320 --> 53:05.754
A friend.
- What kind of friend?

53:07.960 --> 53:10.554
Scootch over. He's a work friend.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.278
What's his name?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.797
- Klaatu.
- Klaatu?

53:16.880 --> 53:19.348
- Yeah.
- What kind of name is that?

53:20.040 --> 53:21.951
It's foreign, I think.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.912
- I never heard you talk about him before.
- I haven't known him for very long.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.309
We're just giving him a ride.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.799
Where?

53:33.640 --> 53:36.108
- Here.
- The forest?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.035
Stay here.

53:42.120 --> 53:46.159
I want you to lock the door, okay?
And don't open it for anyone but me.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.798
I'm serious.

56:19.360 --> 56:21.351
Helen, what's going on?

56:27.240 --> 56:29.276
We're getting images of these spheres
from all over the world.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.157
Okavango, Kobe, Baku...

56:31.240 --> 56:32.912
Which of our agencies gathered this intel?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.675
Ma'am, none of them.
We pulled these off the Internet.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.029
Is that them?

56:45.360 --> 56:48.079
No. It's us.

56:48.960 --> 56:51.599
Those are ordinary cephalopods.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.318
Squid. Octopus.

56:56.680 --> 57:01.674
I don't like him. He's weird, and...
Why are we driving him around, anyway?

57:02.400 --> 57:03.549
Um...

57:05.920 --> 57:08.115
It's complicated.

57:08.200 --> 57:10.031
Is he coming home with us?

57:10.120 --> 57:11.997
No. No.

57:12.080 --> 57:16.039
Well, what if you decide you like him
and he wants to move in?

57:16.440 --> 57:18.556
No, it's not like that. God, no.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.119
Listen to me.

57:20.200 --> 57:22.395
No one is moving in.
You don't understand.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.040
Whatever. You wait for him.
I'm going home.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.553
Jacob.

57:31.360 --> 57:32.759
Jacob!

57:34.520 --> 57:35.953
Jacob!

57:37.160 --> 57:39.390
What is the matter with you?

58:12.400 --> 58:14.356
<i>These spheres</i>
<i>now appear to be leaving</i>

58:14.440 --> 58:16.032
<i>in the same mysterious manner</i>
<i>as they came.</i>

58:16.120 --> 58:17.872
<i>Hopefully this mass exodus</i>
<i>will bring an end</i>

58:17.960 --> 58:20.428
<i>to the panic and unrest</i>
<i>we've been seeing around the world.</i>

58:20.520 --> 58:22.556
<i>The only sphere</i>
<i>that doesn't appear to be leaving</i>

58:22.640 --> 58:25.313
<i>is the giant sphere in Central Park.</i>

58:25.760 --> 58:28.115
You think we scared them off?

58:28.760 --> 58:30.591
They're not afraid of us.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.478
I need to get back to the city.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.154
Not till you tell me what's going on.

58:47.240 --> 58:50.312
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.709
Jacob, get in the car.

58:52.800 --> 58:55.712
- He's one of them.
- Please get in the car.

58:57.080 --> 58:58.911
Get in the car.

59:09.960 --> 59:12.679
I need to know what's happening.

59:12.760 --> 59:15.035
This planet is dying.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.076
The human race is killing it.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.549
So you've come here to help us.

59:20.240 --> 59:22.071
No, I didn't.

59:24.720 --> 59:26.472
You said you came to save us.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.915
I said I came to save the Earth.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.150
You came to save the Earth

59:32.400 --> 59:33.833
from us.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.999
You came to save the Earth from us.

59:38.080 --> 59:42.596
We can't risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species.

59:42.680 --> 59:45.353
- What are you saying?
- If the Earth dies, you die.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.159
If you die, the Earth survives.

59:49.080 --> 59:51.310
There are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos

59:51.400 --> 59:53.356
that are capable
of supporting complex life.

59:53.440 --> 59:56.398
- You can't do this.
- This one can't be allowed to perish.

59:56.480 --> 59:59.552
We can change!
We could still turn things around!

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.154
We've watched, we've waited,
and hoped that you would change.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.798
- Please.
- It's reached the tipping point.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.108
- We have to act.
- Please!

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.428
We'll undo the damage you've done

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.988
and give the Earth a chance
to begin again.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.312
Don't do this. Please.
We could change.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.311
We can change.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.916
The decision is made.
The process has begun.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.073
Oh, God.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.433
It won't make any difference, Helen.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.036
Even if they arrest me, even if they kill me,
the process will continue.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.192
Both of you, hands on the car right now!

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.919
- Is that a child in the car?
- Yes.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.237
This is HP-28. I'm on I-67.
I have the FBI suspect in custody

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.995
along with one adult female
and one child. Awaiting instructions.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.195
<i>70140, roger.</i>

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.635
Tell the child to get out of the car.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.598
- Get the kid out of the car!
- Honey, come.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.235
Okay, you two, over there.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.710
You, I'm not going to tell you again.
Hands on the car.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.836
- Please don't hurt him.
- I'm not going to hurt him,

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.832
- so long as he...
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.120
The pain will only last a moment.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.075
You killed him!
You killed him! You killed him!

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.390
- Jacob. Jacob!
- Let me finish.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.310
Shh. Shh.
- You killed him! You killed him!

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.914
- Come sit down.
- He killed him!

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.957
He'll be all right.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.270
I don't understand.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.589
You're going to kill us all,
but you saved him.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.592
He was an obstacle. I meant him no harm.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.473
You could stop this, couldn't you?
If you wanted to.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.030
I tried to reason with you.
I tried to speak with your leaders.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.429
Those aren't our leaders.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.671
If you want to speak to one
of our leaders, I'll take you to one.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.591
Let me take you.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.313
Get in the car.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.753
Maybe they were just
collecting specimens from our planet.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.038
It's not our planet.
That's what he said to me in the hospital.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.353
An ark.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.476
- Excuse me?
- It's an ark.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.832
So are all the other spheres.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.229
They're saving as many species
as they can.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.199
If the sphere is an ark,
then what comes next is...

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.995
The flood.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.672
Karl, we're here.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.079
All right, let's get you settled.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.270
That's a Nobel Prize.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.397
He won it for his work
on biological altruism.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.830
Probably still be in his desk drawer
if I hadn't gotten it framed for him.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.796
- You tired?
- Just a little.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.678
Close, but no.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.159
I wouldn't.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.313
He won't mind.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.198
He's one of them.
You shouldn't be helping him.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.111
We should stop him.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.515
For just this once,
I need you to trust me.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.598
Is it possible?

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.952
I have so many questions to ask you.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.479
It's Bach.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.112
It's beautiful.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.274
So we're not so different after all.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.516
I wish that were true.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.991
So is it a machine
or a living thing?

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.992
- It's both, or neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.435
It seems to be some sort
of silicon-based hybrid.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.115
We're calling it GORT,
Genetically Organized Robotic Technology.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.077
The military and their acronyms.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.991
We've used every
diagnostic method available,

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.516
MRI, thermal imaging, PET scan,
but it was impervious.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.909
So we attempted
a robotically-assisted exploration

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.638
- using a diamond drill.
- And?

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.349
The drill bit fractured. It'll take
24 hours to fix it robotically.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.108
Colonel, we don't have 24 hours.
Send somebody in there to fix that drill.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.229
<i>Food and fuel hoarding</i>
<i>have led to shortages which erupted</i>

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.039
<i>into looting incidents throughout Asia</i>
<i>and South America. Many...</i>

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.633
<i>... outbreaks of rioting and unrest</i>

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.789
<i>in such cities as Guangdong, China,</i>

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.112
<i>London, and Chicago due to the shortages</i>
<i>of such basic commodities as fuel,</i>

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.638
<i>food and drinking water. Many point to</i>
<i>the Central Park sphere as...</i>

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.871
<i>Amidst the chaos</i>
<i>in the New York-New Jersey areas,</i>

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.349
<i>local police are looking</i>
<i>for an escaped convict</i>

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.590
<i>whose name is not being released.</i>

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.716
<i>Authorities believe that he is</i>
<i>a significant threat to the public</i>

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.314
<i>and are asking for any information</i>
<i>that could lead to his capture.</i>

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.915
<i>If you have seen this man,</i>
<i>contact the number on your screen below.</i>

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.309
There must be alternatives.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.358
You must have some technology
that could solve our problem.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:36.795
Your problem is not technology.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.236
The problem is you.
You lack the will to change.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:41.719
Then help us change.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.631
I cannot change your nature.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.870
You treat the world
as you treat each other.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.397
But every civilization
reaches a crisis point eventually.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:53.870
- Most of them don't make it.
- Yours did. How?

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.111
Our sun was dying.
We had to evolve in order to survive.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.158
So it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.037
- that you became what you are now.
- Yes.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.111
Well, that's where we are.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.078
You say we're on the brink
of destruction, and you're right.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.631
But it's only on the brink
that people find the will to change.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.631
Only at the precipice do we evolve.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.792
This is our moment.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.031
Don't take it from us.
We're close to an answer.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.872
What's wrong?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.160
Jacob! Can you get your boots on?

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.675
He can't get caught.
What do I do?

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.309
Change his mind.
Not with reason, but with yourself.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.910
It's too late for that.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.833
Jacob!

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.312
Down here! He's here!

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.789
- Down here! He's here!
- What are you doing?

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.553
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to help them!

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.517
- That's why I called them.
- What?

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.068
- I told them where we are!
- Jacob, you didn't!

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.073
- We shouldn't be helping him!
- Jacob, I'm trying to help us.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.390
We should kill him!
That's what Dad would have done!

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.392
- You fight me on everything. Everything!
- If my dad were here...

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.789
But he isn't here! He's gone!

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.149
Jacob...

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.711
<i>We've extracted the female.</i>
<i>Returning to base.</i>

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.238
<i>- Got a visual on the male.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I see him.</i>

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.036
<i>Yep, got him.</i>
<i>Target acquired. Permission to engage.</i>

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.029
<i>You are clear to engage.</i>
<i>You are go to take out the target.</i>

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.519
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.876
Please don't hurt me.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.719
Thanks.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.876
I don't know where we are.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.076
Can you help me get home?

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.953
This way.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.910
- He's come to exterminate us, hasn't he?
- You can't stop him.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.719
The only chance we have
is if he changes his mind.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.518
You have to let me talk to him!

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.158
What makes you think he'll listen to you?

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.550
I don't know that he will.
But I think he trusts me.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.198
And I don't think he wants to do this.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.313
We have the situation under control.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.960
Madam Secretary, General Quinn
needs to see you in the briefing room.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.917
He says it's urgent.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.799
You're not in control.
You don't know what he's capable of!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.432
But she didn't do anything wrong!
So they should let her go, right?

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.708
You are afraid
you're going to be left alone.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.358
I already am alone.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.718
Helen's just someone that was stuck with
me when my dad died. You know?

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.388
Oh, I forgot. You're an alien.
You don't understand anything.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.398
<i>We're good to go.</i>

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.439
Hold it.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.353
Your sleeve.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.309
<i>Oh...</i>

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.310
<i>Let... Let me out!</i>

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.549
- Open the airlock.
- No.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.358
<i>- Open the door!</i>
- Then we have to flash.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.000
- Our protocol...
- I decide what protocol is.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.435
<i>Open the door! Let me out!</i>

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.711
- Reset the drill.
<i>- Let me out! Open it!</i>

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.597
I said, reset the drill.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.990
<i>Let me out! Let me out! Open the door!</i>

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.279
<i>Let me out!</i>

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.951
Sir, the restraints!

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.474
Open the door! Open the door!

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.915
This facility has been sealed.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.033
No one leaves.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.637
We've lost contact
with the flash chamber, sir.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.470
Whiskey Task Force, engage!

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.075
Were there any survivors?
- No.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.756
As you know, at 0524 hours,

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.115
our pilots launched a salvo
of Sidewinder air-to-air missiles

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.668
- into the heart of the mass.
- And?

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.671
Every strike made it larger.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.354
And this mass, where is it heading?

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.519
Everywhere.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.989
- Dr. Benson.
- Madam Secretary, please.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.676
I don't want to die here in this room
without seeing my son one more time.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.154
Do you really think you can persuade him?

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.708
I think you should let me try.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.872
Go on, then.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.509
But I make you no promises.
I still answer to the President.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.149
- You're on your own.
- No, she's not. I'll go with you.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.671
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.192
It doesn't work.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.433
Go ahead.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.837
It's me. Are you okay?

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.879
I'm fine.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.878
He's right here.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.710
She wants to talk to you.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.393
Yes.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.633
I need to get back to the city.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.756
- Yes.
- Tell her I know where we can meet her.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.108
I told Helen we should kill you.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.116
Yes, I heard that.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.237
- I didn't mean it, though.
- You didn't?

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.117
Well, not anymore.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.869
So what's gonna happen to us?

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.999
I was just wondering the same thing.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.319
- End of the world!
- Good luck!

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.197
This is it! This is where
we're supposed to meet her!

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.679
Come on!

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.556
Hurry up! It's this way!

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.630
You can do this. Just like with the trooper.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.870
There are some things I can't do.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.837
But you have powers.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.079
I'm sorry.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.633
Please.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.159
Please!

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.755
Jacob, nothing ever truly dies.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.591
The universe wastes nothing.
Everything is simply

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.638
transformed.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.477
Just leave me alone.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.638
- It's not fair.
- No.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.551
No, it isn't fair.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.755
He left me alone.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.952
Oh, baby, you're not alone.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.111
And he didn't leave you.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.749
I see him in you. All the time.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.232
All the time.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.880
Sometimes it's hard for me to bear.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.952
You miss him, too?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.833
So much.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.432
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.672
Okay.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.872
It's all right. He's here to help.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.632
There's another side to you.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.318
I feel it now.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.031
Is that how it ends?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.389
Yes.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.272
You can't stop it?

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.839
I don't know.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.229
It would come at a price
to you and your way of life.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.278
But we can change. You know that now.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.473
Please.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.275
Please, just give us a chance.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.598
I'll try.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.750
I must get back to the city.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.350
Of course, Mr. President.
I understand the situation.

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.436
But with all due respect, sir,

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.512
any further military action
will only make things worse.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.990
I believe we may still be able
to open a dialog...

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.438
Yes, Mr. President. As you wish, sir.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.919
Thank you.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.479
Checkpoint.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.994
We can't stop. There isn't time.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.552
- Dive!
- Look out!

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.477
Lincoln-Bravo-1 to Lincoln-Bravo-2,

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.710
a black SUV crashed our checkpoint
with the suspects.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.031
- En route to your position.
<i>- Roger that, Bravo-1.</i>

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.198
<i>Bravo-1, we've got orders</i>
<i>to let them through. Do you copy?</i>

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.679
Roger that.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.512
They're slowing down.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.160
- They're letting us through.
- Why?

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.352
Where is everybody?

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.676
They've cleared the area.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.589
Stop the car.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.511
- What?
- Stop the car!

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.476
Jacob! Jacob!

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.232
I'm okay.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.753
Michael?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.355
We have to get to the sphere.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.593
Helen!

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.958
We won't make it!

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.549
I can't keep them out for long.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.553
Mom.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.228
What's happening to him?

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.753
Jacob.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.517
They're inside him.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.919
He's dying.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.673
Help him.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.991
Help him. Please.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.754
Your professor was right.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.558
At the precipice,

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.953
we change.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.278
It's leaving.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.599
No.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.352
He's leaving.
