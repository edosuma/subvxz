- So what are you saying?

00:12.829 --> 00:14.724
You're an undocumented

just got listed by Spotify.

tour with Midtown's

05:05.574 --> 05:07.026

09:40.360 --> 09:43.246
about that little
white devil bitch.

09:44.242 --> 09:46.066
You know what, Miss Ruby?

09:47.049 --> 09:50.584
The only thing devilish in
this room is that breath.

09:51.794 --> 09:53.928
- Oh, I'm gonna...
- Ruby, come on now. Ruby, don't...

09:53.953 --> 09:55.998
- She don't know me.
- Come on, it's not like that.

10:01.749 --> 10:03.234
Girl, what is wrong with you?

10:03.259 --> 10:05.906
That crazy old lady's been calling
you the devil since you met her.

10:05.931 --> 10:07.034
Yeah, I know.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.182
Look, I'm sorry I
told Miss Carlotta

10:10.207 --> 10:12.941
about you, Alex and Noah, but we
can't keep living lies, Star.

10:12.966 --> 10:15.226
I'm not mad about that, Simone.
I could care less.

10:16.507 --> 10:18.048
Are you fighting
with Brody or...?

10:18.073 --> 10:19.345
No, I ain't seen him.

10:21.024 --> 10:22.376
Yeah.

10:23.193 --> 10:26.157
Man, I-I still can't
believe he killed Arlene.

10:27.030 --> 10:29.496
What kind of sick
person kills like that?

10:34.254 --> 10:35.336
Me.

10:37.882 --> 10:40.088
You mean Otis? You
were protecting me.

10:40.449 --> 10:41.481
You didn't even kill him.

10:44.037 --> 10:46.637
What did you do?
What did you do?

10:46.977 --> 10:48.456
<i>What did you do?</i>

10:48.516 --> 10:50.471
- Star.
- Hello?

10:55.967 --> 10:57.381
We got a party to set up, right?

10:57.664 --> 10:58.889

Hey. I got the folding chairs
you wanted being delivered,

11:12.425 --> 11:14.307
and I'll pick up the ice
on my way over tonight.

11:14.332 --> 11:15.869
- Thank you.
- I got your text.

11:15.894 --> 11:17.494
How in the hell did you find

11:17.519 --> 11:19.619
- a DJ Khaled song in the vault?
- Because he sold it

11:19.652 --> 11:22.097
to the Floyds under one
of his old street names,

11:22.568 --> 11:24.409
so I told him I'm giving
it to Take Three.

11:24.613 --> 11:25.968
Why wouldn't you
give it to Noah?

11:26.307 --> 11:28.774
I mean, the melody sounds
like it wants a solo artist.

11:28.799 --> 11:31.199
Yeah, but the lyrics can
be split up for a trio.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.645
- The girls need this.
- Yeah, they do.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.557
They'll be on every
playlist with DJ Khaled.

11:37.576 --> 11:40.143
But you can't say it wouldn't be
a good look for your new artist.

11:40.168 --> 11:42.229
Don't have me feeling
guilty about Noah.

11:42.634 --> 11:43.869
I'm just sayin'.

11:44.102 --> 11:45.584

Yeah, don't hate me, but
I went to go see her.

12:10.507 --> 12:11.906
- Simone.
- Look, she is worried

12:11.931 --> 12:13.686
about you having problems
with immigration.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.468
What you listening to?
Where'd you get that?

14:15.561 --> 14:19.021
This, uh, new DJ Khaled song.
Carlotta gave it to me for the tour.

14:19.179 --> 14:21.271
- You mean our song?
- What you mean, your song?

14:21.296 --> 14:22.450
- It's ours.
- Are you serious?

14:22.474 --> 14:23.793
- That's our song.
- Carlotta...

14:23.818 --> 14:26.890
- That's why I'm here. Listen.
- To what? Carlotta,

14:26.915 --> 14:28.868
you know that song is
perfect for Take Three.

14:28.893 --> 14:30.907
And for me, too. Don't
forget about what I could do

14:30.932 --> 14:31.999
- to this track.
- Yeah, we do know what

14:32.023 --> 14:34.509
you're gonna do to that track.
You're gonna make it into a slow jam

14:34.533 --> 14:36.783
and dance around in circles
shirtless like you always do.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.697
- You are kind of one note, dude.
- That's funny

14:38.722 --> 14:41.081
coming from you three who would
just be grinding on a chair, right?

14:41.105 --> 14:42.612
I'm here for all y'all.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.620
Take Three and Noah
will both do demos.

14:45.312 --> 14:48.546
Turn 'em in today. Maurice will
speak for Midtown and decide.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.746
And I promise I will
find a joint just as hot

14:51.855 --> 14:53.211
for whoever doesn't
get this one.

14:53.394 --> 14:54.714
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

14:54.739 --> 14:57.859
Right. So we are right back
to where we always were.

14:58.176 --> 14:59.653
Competing with Noah Brooks.

15:00.239 --> 15:02.285
Well, maybe you should've
thought about that

15:02.310 --> 15:03.976
before you spread
your legs for him.

15:08.609 --> 15:12.200
"On my... way." Done.

15:12.225 --> 15:15.130
- Hey. Miss C., you got a sec?
- I'm already late

15:15.155 --> 15:16.746
to help Bruce get set
up for the party.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.879
You girls good to start the
demo on your own, right?

15:18.957 --> 15:20.075
Yeah. Yeah.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.432
Okay. And check on your sister.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.190
Something is wrong with her.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.518
Yeah. Well, by the way, Miss C.,

15:25.012 --> 15:26.561
your wig is looking
super fly today.

15:27.108 --> 15:29.100
Your hair's just glowing
with that purple.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.975
Okay, come on now.
What do you want?

15:32.974 --> 15:36.631
Look, I was thinking maybe Angel
could live with us in the salon?

15:36.835 --> 15:39.683
- Hell no! I just got rid of his uncle.
- Wait.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.926
Please. It's to protect him against
immigration in case they pop up.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.645
You know it's more than that.

15:45.315 --> 15:46.676
You got feelings for him.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.878
Yeah, well, look, Miss
C., I'm just trying

15:48.903 --> 15:50.350
to do the Christian thing.

15:51.783 --> 15:52.818
He needs us.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.791
Christian thing, huh?

15:57.448 --> 16:00.092
All right, look, if you can find
a couch or somewhere for him

16:00.117 --> 16:02.084
- to sleep, then...
- Okay. Okay!

16:02.109 --> 16:03.870
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:03.895 --> 16:05.395
- Thank you, Miss C.
- Yeah.

16:05.430 --> 16:08.198
Yeah, you won't regret it. And
you know what? We got room

16:08.233 --> 16:09.666
because Alex isn't
moving back in.

16:09.701 --> 16:11.680
So, I'll set that all up.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.859
I'm gonna do my warm-ups.
It's gonna be great.

16:14.138 --> 16:15.425
- Okay.
- Alex?

16:16.403 --> 16:18.418
- Alex, I need to speak with you!
- I can't.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.844
I got to go work on this
demo you gave to Noah.

16:21.173 --> 16:23.245
When y'all gonna stop
acting like kids?

16:23.588 --> 16:25.510
Is Noah the reason
you not back home?

16:26.844 --> 16:29.429
See, it's that business right
there that broke up me and Mary.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.288
We let JAHIL get between
us, and that was it.

16:32.874 --> 16:34.921
And I'm not about to let
that happen to y'all.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.492
It's not Noah.

16:38.346 --> 16:39.580
It's Derek.

16:43.368 --> 16:45.810
Every time I see
him, I feel guilty.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.101
That kills, you know?

16:52.007 --> 16:53.117
Yeah.

16:54.382 --> 16:57.676
I can't live next door to
him and focus on the tour.

16:57.949 --> 17:01.270
Listen, Alex, just do
what you need to do.

17:01.989 --> 17:03.445
Come home when you're ready.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.311
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.259
Now, where's Blondie?

17:09.661 --> 17:11.761
- We got a song to fix.
- All right.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.700
- Make it a banger.
- Always.

17:18.915 --> 17:21.215
All right, look, I'm just...
start from the top

17:21.241 --> 17:23.025
and sing all the way down. Yeah.

17:23.207 --> 17:25.688
Of course Carlotta gave you
our studio space. Why not?

17:25.991 --> 17:27.259
She already gave you our song.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.257
First of all, y'all are
in Studio C, okay?

17:30.282 --> 17:32.525
And second, the song belongs
to whoever makes it a hit.

17:32.799 --> 17:35.365
This is not personal. This just
how the game goes. You know that.

17:35.390 --> 17:36.964
I'm tired of hearing
it's not personal.

17:37.705 --> 17:40.215
It's a gang of managers in
Atlanta, and you chose mine.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.207
Oh, my God. You seriously think
everything is about you.

17:43.411 --> 17:46.312
Working with Carlotta is so I
don't screw up my last chance.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.186
I'm not above asking for help.

17:48.271 --> 17:51.405
You should, 'cause your attitude
lately has been extra ugly.

17:51.503 --> 17:54.614
That's what happens when you
steal my manager, or my music,

17:54.671 --> 17:57.919
- or anything that's mine.
- Nah, it's something else.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.574
You lie as good as
that wig on your head.

18:02.721 --> 18:04.377
You wish it was

to put you with all them
evil white folks, either.

41:38.407 --> 41:41.008
Ain't it funny how we can be
done in over and over again,

41:41.033 --> 41:43.000
but we still
expected to be fair?

41:43.092 --> 41:45.826
I survived Jim Crow,
I survived the KKK,

41:45.874 --> 41:48.337
and I'm gonna survive that
monster in the White House.

41:49.649 --> 41:51.684
So I guess I can
handle your ass.

41:52.331 --> 41:54.933
Plus, I don't think
you're really white.

41:56.331 --> 41:57.481
Sorry to disappoint you,

41:57.506 --> 41:59.731
but I'm pretty sure I
am white, Miss Ruby.

41:59.929 --> 42:02.223
Well, not that kind of white.

42:05.426 --> 42:08.301
Thank you... I guess.

42:18.914 --> 42:20.258
Where you been?

42:21.315 --> 42:22.527
Did you sleep here?

42:22.731 --> 42:24.629
Uh, yeah. In the RV...

42:26.824 --> 42:28.195
with Noah.

42:28.556 --> 42:30.070
Jesus, take the wheel.

42:34.364 --> 42:35.373
Damn.

42:36.238 --> 42:37.639
Don't do nothin'
till I get back.

42:37.664 --> 42:39.311
This is better than
one of my stories.

42:39.901 --> 42:41.404
Disgusting.

42:44.688 --> 42:47.094
I'm sorry, babe. We got about
one more hour before we open.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.575
No. I'm actually
looking for someone.

42:50.044 --> 42:52.231
My son's father
used to live here.

42:52.462 --> 42:53.750
Your son's father?

42:54.415 --> 42:57.375
That damn Peruvian bastard
could never keep his pants on.

42:57.657 --> 42:59.218
JAHIL left about two weeks ago.

42:59.546 --> 43:01.531
- I can get his number, though.
- Not him.

43:01.556 --> 43:04.109
My son's father is named Arnold.

43:04.563 --> 43:05.769
Arnold?

43:12.266 --> 43:14.174
Arnold's not here no more.
