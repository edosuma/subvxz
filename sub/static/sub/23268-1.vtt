WEBVTT

02:36.240 --> 02:37.321
Daphne?

02:37.400 --> 02:38.401
Yes?

04:34.080 --> 04:35.684
Do excuse me.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.691
Poor Blue.
Are you feeling odd?

04:41.040 --> 04:43.884
Come on. I'll let
you dance with me.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.328
Come on.
You're the man.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.204
Take the lead.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.720
Damn it. I'm sorry.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.291
Well, I should think so too!

05:16.440 --> 05:18.090
You laddered my stockings.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.401
Don't mind them.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.766
They're all just jealous

05:20.880 --> 05:22.484
because my husband is the
only one clever enough...

05:22.560 --> 05:24.562
...not to get himself killed.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.880
I say, do you mind if I cut in?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.450
Oh!
Ernest!

05:28.400 --> 05:29.561
Hello, Blue.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.209
You'll just have to
find another partner, Daph.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.407
All right.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.245
I was at the Somme.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.447
That was a bad show.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.081
They were all bad shows.
Where were you?

05:39.880 --> 05:40.881
Passchendaele.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.801
Exactly.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.610
Milne! You're back.
Rupert.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.683
How splendid you look.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.606
And Shepard! Punch's funniest
writer and best illustrator.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.445
Ready to put a smile back
on our faces?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.523
Oh, yes. In fact, I wrote
a brilliant little farce

05:55.600 --> 05:56.647
while I was at the front.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.961
Did you really?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.607
I sat there with my
typewriter, glass of sherry...

06:00.760 --> 06:02.364
...knocked it out while
the whizz bangs

06:02.440 --> 06:03.601
popped all around us.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.928
Sometimes the gas would
steam my glasses up,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.968
you know, but apart from that...

06:08.040 --> 06:10.168
Well, this is wonderful news.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.169
I can't wait to read it.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.287
Milne.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.167
Right.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.487
Where to start?

06:20.640 --> 06:25.601
A few years ago in Sarajevo,
one Archduke was shot.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.445
And the next thing we know,

06:27.520 --> 06:30.524
ten million
non-archdukes are shot.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.128
And for what?
What a jolly little farce.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.728
But I know that
the final curtain...

06:37.880 --> 06:39.769
...is surely coming
for archdukes

06:39.920 --> 06:41.251
and top hats and the like...

06:41.400 --> 06:43.721
...and for all
the other fools...

06:43.920 --> 06:48.084
...who led ordinary decent
folk to the slaughter.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.081
So, what can one say but...

06:55.560 --> 06:56.766
...Tinketty Tonk.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.842
Tinketty Tonk.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.042
We were always exhausted.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.762
Never quite knew if we
were awake or dreaming.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.123
And the flies.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.967
Big bloated blue bottles.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.966
Not just the flies themselves...

07:28.600 --> 07:31.410
...but the thought
they used to be maggots.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.481
And when they were maggots,
they were eating--

07:34.680 --> 07:35.806
That's quite enough of that.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.405
I'm sorry,
I thought you were asleep.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.444
You know, if you don't
think about a thing,

07:43.520 --> 07:45.170
then it ceases to exist.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.448
It's true. I read about it.
It's all in Plato.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.646
It's called philosophy.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.446
Oh, philosophy.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.811
Well, I hope you know
you're laughing at Plato.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.490
Blue, life is full of
frightful things.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.282
The great thing
is to find something

08:11.360 --> 08:13.886
to be happy about
and stick to that.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.647
Hmm?

08:36.559 --> 08:37.846
Oh, my G--

08:39.840 --> 08:41.205
Get it out!

08:44.360 --> 08:47.170
It's quite all right.
It's all going swimmingly.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.685
It's not all right!

08:49.160 --> 08:51.049
Where is he? Blue!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.001
Blue?

08:53.920 --> 08:56.002
That's me.
Perhaps I should--

08:56.160 --> 08:57.764
She's a silly girl.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.201
Here he is, sir.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.845
Perfect birth, sir.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.570
However,
Mrs. Milne was unaware of

09:17.680 --> 09:19.728
the mechanics of the thing.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.726
Daphne.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.921
Get him out.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.081
Daph...

09:31.200 --> 09:33.407
I will not have him
see me blubbing.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.562
Probably best, sir.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.928
Latest Milne production debuted

09:44.040 --> 09:45.644
at 20 past 6:00
this morning...

09:45.800 --> 09:48.406
...weighing in at
a startling nine pounds.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.561
Good heavens.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.290
At least the midwife
says nine pounds.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.970
I have the distinct
impression that

09:53.080 --> 09:54.605
midwives are a little
like anglers, you know?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.967
Prone to exaggerate
the size of the catch.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.088
Shall I propose a toast?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.321
A double toast!

10:00.480 --> 10:02.289
There's to be a revival
of Alan's play

10:02.400 --> 10:05.404
Mr. Pim Passes By
at the Kingsway.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.960
You all right?

10:11.440 --> 10:12.441
Yes.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.167
I'm the same
when my motorbike backfires.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.802
I've been thinking
of moving down

10:18.920 --> 10:20.649
to the countryside where
it's peaceful and quiet.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.768
Don't tell Daphne,
for God's sake.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.685
Up here. That's what
we need to sort out.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.091
A toast.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.288
C.R. Milne.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.130
ALL; C.R. Milne.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.521
Hello?

11:23.840 --> 11:24.841
Oh.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.040
Hello?

11:37.840 --> 11:38.841
Hmm.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.521
Uh...

11:42.320 --> 11:45.051
Not completely sure
which way up he should go.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.885
Still alive.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.730
You know, Daph, boys
can be fun too, you know.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.721
I'm a boy.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.041
I just keep thinking.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.441
It's such a terrible feeling.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.725
He's a boy.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.925
He'll grow up.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.722
He'll put on a uniform
and he'll go off to war.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.680
And I will be waiting again
like I waited for you.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.245
Never knowing.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.886
You listen to me.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.362
I just fought in the War
to End All Wars.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.251
There won't be another one.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.084
I couldn't stand to love someone

12:27.200 --> 12:29.043
who was going away again, Blue.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.765
Not like that.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.564
His name is Christopher Robin,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.290
but we generally call him Billy.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.769
You thought he was a girl. Oh.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.490
So did we until he was born.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.165
Please, take a seat.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.163
She was going
to be called Rosemary

12:50.280 --> 12:52.362
and I bought her all these
delicious dresses.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.441
I see.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.971
Just seems a pity to
waste them, don't you think?

12:55.120 --> 12:56.326
Of course.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.562
Well, you have had
an interesting life.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.927
Looking after the Chilean
ambassador's children.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.081
What fun!

13:02.240 --> 13:03.969
And terrific parties,
I should think.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.086
It was very enjoyable.
We traveled a lot.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.401
Why would you
want to look after him

13:08.480 --> 13:09.811
when you've had such fun, then?

13:11.280 --> 13:12.691
My mother is quite ill.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.768
She'll be needing
some attention from me.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.287
So staying in one place
will be useful.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.681
Well, we're going on holiday.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.325
Just to Italy.
For a month or so.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.811
Oh, very wise.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.406
By the time you come home,
I shall have your little man

13:24.480 --> 13:26.084
settled into a nice,
steady routine.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.520
That's very reassuring.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.489
You know, the one good thing
about the war is...

13:29.640 --> 13:31.961
...there are lots of marvelous
women around like you...

13:32.160 --> 13:33.207
...who are never
going to get married

13:33.320 --> 13:34.321
because there are no men.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.481
So you can take on
work like this.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.601
Daphne.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.764
Yes? But it's true,
isn't it?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.891
Mummy and Daddy
are going to a ball!

13:48.040 --> 13:49.849
- Your majesty.
- My liege.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.725
Don't they look lovely?

13:52.320 --> 13:53.685
Goodbye!

13:53.840 --> 13:57.561
Look, Billy, Mummy and Daddy
are off again on holiday.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.326
Ho-Ii-day.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.527
Thank you.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.842
It's Daddy's first night.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.249
Nou,
how can it be his first night?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.368
Blue is about 100 years old.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.649
It's the first night
of his new play, silly.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.205
Well, for all you cricket
enthusiasts here in the audience...

14:21.360 --> 14:22.964
...I'm sorry
to report that rain

14:23.040 --> 14:24.644
has stopped play at the Oval.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.370
Here in the West End, of course,

14:27.480 --> 14:28.527
nothing stops the play.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.882
Um, this, this play...

14:38.560 --> 14:39.561
I-I wrote this play...

14:40.920 --> 14:42.001
This, this play was...

14:43.680 --> 14:46.047
I wrote this--

14:46.200 --> 14:47.361
I wrote this--

14:49.200 --> 14:51.009
The play was, um...

14:55.520 --> 14:56.726
You're supposed
to make a speech.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.889
You're supposed to say
something sweet about--

15:27.440 --> 15:29.920
You missed
the most enchanting party.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.081
And the play was pretty good.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.520
It's in all the papers,

15:32.600 --> 15:34.125
if you want the details.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.725
"The Princess Royal
accompanied by

15:35.800 --> 15:37.131
Princess Maud was in a box.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.601
"Sir James Barrie and...

15:39.920 --> 15:41.081
"...the elegant Mrs. Milne."

15:41.240 --> 15:43.447
Alan, if you hadn't deserted me,

15:43.520 --> 15:44.521
people wouldn't take the liberty

15:44.600 --> 15:45.647
of making remarks like that.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.603
Remarks? What remarks?
"Elegant" is not a remark.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.610
"Elegant" means
over 30. Everyone knows that.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.211
You'll never
be elegant in my eyes.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.089
What did we fight that war for?

15:56.680 --> 15:57.806
Why doesn't anyone
talk about it?

15:57.920 --> 15:59.331
Why does everyone act
as though nothing happened?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.806
Well, it is over.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.644
And what am I doing about it?
Nothing!

16:02.800 --> 16:04.689
You're doing what you're
good at. Writing plays.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.251
Nothing has changed.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.851
Don't you see?
If nothing changes,

16:07.960 --> 16:10.850
then the same thing
will happen all over again.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.285
I need to get out of London.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.930
A nice day out would
do us all the world of good.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.161
Ernest, you must come too.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.970
I don't think Blue
is talking about a picnic.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.208
I'm talking about
leaving for good.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.804
I'm talking about
going somewhere quiet

16:23.960 --> 16:25.450
and decent and trying
to think for once.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.806
Do something worthwhile.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.480
Surely a West End playwright
needs to be in the West End.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.371
I've had enough of
making people laugh.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.685
I want to make them see.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.370
Well, I think it's
a perfectly horrid idea.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.681
Daphne.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.569
Horrid and ridiculous.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.530
Daphne, don't you see--

16:42.680 --> 16:43.886
For heaven's sake, don't plead.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.961
If you're going to do it,
get on with it.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.366
Not in the mud! Don't
let them fall into the mud!

17:02.520 --> 17:05.171
Upstairs.
Now where's the desk?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.367
Up here. Up here.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.647
Over there. Actually...

17:10.839 --> 17:12.329
I know you like a view
when you're writing, Alan,

17:12.400 --> 17:14.084
but might that be a distraction?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.201
Alan?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.721
Alan?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.401
Alan?

17:49.720 --> 17:53.611
Deeper and deeper into
the dark wood they went.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.765
Oh, they're here.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.248
Oh, where is it?
It's here somewhere.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.771
Alan, where is it?
Where's what?

18:11.880 --> 18:12.881
Ah.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.722
Mummy's here!
Of course Mummy's here.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.723
You're going to live here.
This is your new home.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.730
Yes. But I didn't know

18:20.800 --> 18:22.643
they were going
to live in it too.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.122
Well, I say, Billy Moon,

18:32.240 --> 18:34.083
this is an unexpected pleasure.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.810
Have you come to see my woods?

18:35.960 --> 18:37.405
Are they really your woods?

18:37.560 --> 18:39.847
Oh, yes. As far as
the eye can see.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.248
Well, a bear does
feel more at home

18:42.320 --> 18:43.765
in the woods amongst
the wild animals.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.445
Are there really wild animals?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.369
I can't continue
this conversation

18:47.480 --> 18:49.608
till we've been
properly introduced.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.842
I'm Billy Moon
and you're Teddy Bear.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.445
Edward Bear, if you don't mind.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.681
I don't like that name.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.609
Mummy will help us
think of a new one.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.722
You do know it was me talking,
not the bear?

18:59.800 --> 19:01.165
I was just playing, you see.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.322
Yes. I was just joining in.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.683
Of course.
Silly of me.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.926
Do you have room

19:18.000 --> 19:19.126
for one very small piglet?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.247
Yes!

19:20.440 --> 19:21.566
I have some very quiet friends.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.806
They'll be no trouble.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.884
Do you have
any objection to tigers?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.201
No.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.883
Say goodnight to Teddy.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.883
Edward. Remember?

19:36.360 --> 19:38.488
Edward. Of course.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.486
God bless Mummy.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.642
God bless Daddy.
God bless Nou.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.721
Amen.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.370
Forgotten someone.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.521
Who?

19:49.720 --> 19:50.846
Keep thinking.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.724
I've made the study my priority

19:56.880 --> 19:58.211
so that you can
get back to work...

19:58.360 --> 19:59.486
...while the rest
of us unpack

19:59.560 --> 20:01.210
and choose curtain fabrics
and so on.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.361
Your files and notebook--

20:02.520 --> 20:03.567
I'll unpack them.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.171
There's really no need.
I can...

20:05.240 --> 20:06.401
Stop.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.361
Stop.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.561
Look.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.520
Me! I forgot to bless me.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.206
God bless me. Amen.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.601
Madam.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.921
Thank you, Mrs. Penn.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.368
Shh. Daddy's working.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.245
Can't get you.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.881
Over here!

20:50.120 --> 20:51.884
That was awfully good.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.008
Bit higher!
Come on, higher!

20:58.720 --> 21:00.051
Hello there!

21:00.440 --> 21:03.125
Mummy said we mustn't talk
to you when you're working.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.051
This isn't that sort of work.
This is proper work.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.161
Come here.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.726
Hold this.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.610
Push down hard.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.807
What is it for?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.241
We're going to have chickens.
We'll need a chicken run.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.131
Somewhere they can move about
and not be eaten by foxes.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.327
Are there real foxes?

21:20.480 --> 21:23.131
All sorts of wild animals
here, I shouldn't wonder.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.243
The object of my affection

21:26.320 --> 21:28.084
Can change my complexion

21:28.160 --> 21:30.970
From white to a rosy read

21:32.280 --> 21:34.521
Anytime he holds my hand

21:35.240 --> 21:37.004
And tells me that he's mine

21:38.640 --> 21:40.688
Oh, Billy.
Okay. All right. Right.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.484
Go, go! You put that back.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.369
- Over here!
- Oh! That's it.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.967
All right,
come on! Come on!

21:47.120 --> 21:48.884
Okay, we've got him.
We've got him.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.371
In you go. That's it.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.570
Wait for me!

22:26.840 --> 22:28.365
What are you doing here?

22:28.800 --> 22:29.881
Sorry. I just--

22:30.040 --> 22:31.963
Nou will be wondering
where you are.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.730
Shall I go back?

22:39.160 --> 22:40.525
No, come along.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.684
Sorry, Father.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.561
Sorry, Father. Sorry.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.046
Quickly.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.440
I won't talk to you.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.206
Nou says you're writing
a very important book,

23:03.360 --> 23:05.203
so I'm not to talk to you.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.402
You do realize
you're talking now, don't you?

23:07.560 --> 23:09.528
Yes, but I've stopped now.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.966
While I'm not talking,

23:11.040 --> 23:13.202
could you think of
a good name for a donkey?

23:14.560 --> 23:15.721
Eeyore.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.406
Eeyore! Excellent. Thank you.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.445
Where are you going?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.170
Watching out for wild animals.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.685
You said
there'd be wild animals.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.208
Well, take care.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.406
What? What can you hear?
Is it a tiger?

23:35.240 --> 23:36.241
No.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.045
Not here.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.045
Just stay calm.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.490
Just stand still.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.561
Couldn't we just--

23:48.640 --> 23:50.961
Just stand still, I said.
You listen to me.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.645
Sorry.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.646
They'll be gone in a minute.
Just stay calm.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.450
Bees are good, aren't they?

23:57.960 --> 23:59.769
Even though they can sting...

23:59.920 --> 24:01.206
...they hardly ever do,

24:01.280 --> 24:03.965
so long as you leave them
to get on with things.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.770
They just want to make honey.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.441
Honey?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.764
That's what Nou says, anyway.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.441
Bees.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.441
Yes.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.566
I completely forgot about bees.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.961
And honey.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.610
I forgot about honey.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.811
Billy, you're an
entomological genius.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.961
What's that?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.929
It's an insect scientist.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.964
You're the best there ever was.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.806
Well done.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.326
Honey.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.648
How silly.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.204
Thank you, Billy Moon.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.205
That's all right.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.966
Well, I've chosen the material.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.485
All you have to do
is run a few up.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.324
More smocks.
Yes.

24:54.480 --> 24:57.882
Isn't he going to look
such a chicken? Where is he?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.725
He seems to have gone
for a walk with Mr. Milne.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.326
Mr. Milne needs time and quiet
to write his blasted book.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.966
He can't have the boy trailing
everywhere after him.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.088
Oh, Billy Moon,
where on Earth have you been?

25:08.160 --> 25:09.400
We've all been so worried.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.683
I was with Blue.
Exactly.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.841
And if you keep on like this,

25:12.960 --> 25:14.121
you're going to get
Nanny the sack.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.483
Daph, it was good that he was
there, in fact. In the end.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.244
Nevertheless,
how are you going to get

25:19.360 --> 25:21.044
any writing done if you're
doing her job for her?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.851
I mean, really, we might well
as not have a nanny if she--

25:24.360 --> 25:25.805
Now see,
you've made the boy cry.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.571
No, she hasn't. She hasn't.
You have. Leave her alone!

25:28.720 --> 25:30.324
Billy! Don't talk
to your mother like that.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.845
I only went because of you.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.126
You said there were wild animals

25:33.200 --> 25:34.486
and there weren't
any wild animals.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.721
We saw squirrels.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.330
Squirrels aren't wild animals!

25:37.480 --> 25:39.721
And anyway, it's lucky
there weren't any wild animals

25:39.840 --> 25:41.046
because he's scared of bees!

25:41.120 --> 25:42.121
Billy!

25:42.200 --> 25:44.328
Just take him away, would you?

25:46.560 --> 25:49.040
Apparently,
he was expecting bears.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.771
In Sussex?

25:52.400 --> 25:54.402
I don't see
what's funny about it.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.244
The boy has
ridiculous expectations...

25:56.400 --> 25:59.609
...because you have made him
ridiculous promises.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.921
Just as you did with me.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.602
First, I had a baby
just to cheer you up.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.889
Nearly killed me.
And it didn't cheer you up.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.491
Then we move to the countryside,

26:08.560 --> 26:09.686
surrounded by wild animals.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.769
The whole point was that
there are no wild animals.

26:12.720 --> 26:16.281
And the only response you have
is to be facetious. Really.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.805
Nothing is enough for you.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.440
Daphne?

26:26.400 --> 26:27.401
Daphne!
Oh, Alan!

26:27.600 --> 26:28.931
How lovely to see you.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.884
Welcome to your study.
Look, here's a desk.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.610
Do you remember "desks"?
What are you talking about?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.964
You said you were bringing us
here to write something.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.081
So write something!

26:40.440 --> 26:42.602
You are a writer
who doesn't write!

26:42.760 --> 26:43.761
I'm thinking.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.046
Well, let's hear
your great thoughts.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.246
I'm thinking about
where we go next.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.321
London!

26:47.440 --> 26:49.647
No, not us. England.
Where does England go next?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.287
The country is wounded, Daph.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.167
It's lost men, yes.
But it's lost more than that.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.843
We need a sense of purpose.
Don't you see?

27:00.280 --> 27:01.645
The nations of the world,

27:01.760 --> 27:03.683
they got together
and banned slavery.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.649
What if we did
the same with war?

27:05.800 --> 27:08.804
What if we all, all nations,
got together and decided...

27:08.960 --> 27:10.246
...that when there was
a conflict,

27:10.320 --> 27:12.288
when there was a dispute,
war was no way to settle it.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.484
War would go the way
of the slave trade.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.330
Yes, that proves
my point exactly.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.930
No, you weren't making a point.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.365
My point is
I have to go to London

27:29.480 --> 27:31.687
to look at Whiteleys'
new wallpaper collection.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.968
- Right. Fine.
- Yes, it is fine.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.327
Because do you know what writing
a book against war is like?

27:36.480 --> 27:37.527
No. Tell me.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.125
It's like writing a book
against Wednesdays.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.169
Wednesdays, Blue,
are a fact of life...

27:41.240 --> 27:44.005
...and if you don't like them, you could
stay in bed but you can't stop them...

27:44.080 --> 27:45.241
...because Wednesdays
are coming

27:45.320 --> 27:47.641
and if today isn't actually
a Wednesday it soon will be.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.521
Goodbye.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.531
Fine. When will you be back?
I'm not coming back.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.803
You're not coming back. Fine.

28:01.040 --> 28:04.681
I know you, Blue,
you're a writer.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.685
If you don't start writing properly
soon, you'll be unbearable.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.043
Write and I'll come back.
If you don't, then I shan't.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.845
- What about Billy?
- What about Billy?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.365
You'll have to
take him with you.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.567
Boys are not interested
in wallpaper.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.000
They're not interested
in being quiet either.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.844
Perhaps if Ma'am
is going to London...

28:23.000 --> 28:24.047
...we could both come

28:24.160 --> 28:25.764
and I could take him to the zoo?

29:27.160 --> 29:29.208
Christopher Robin, allow me to

29:29.280 --> 29:32.250
introduce you
to my older brother, um...

29:33.760 --> 29:35.046
Winnie, apparently.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.121
Winnie.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.969
That's a girl's name.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.963
Well, our mother would have
preferred a girl.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.610
I should think
if you look like that,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.762
you can call yourself
whatever you like.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.925
So fierce.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.046
Edward Bear
is not really going to

29:49.120 --> 29:50.167
grow up like that, is he?

29:50.320 --> 29:54.120
Goodness no. He's going
to stay little forever.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.650
Like my boy.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.961
The thing about war is, Alan,

30:11.040 --> 30:12.565
who wants to read about it?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.210
I should have
thought that was obvious.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.169
Anyone who doesn't want it
to happen again.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.164
Everyone in England
seems to be cross.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.483
Strikes. Protests.
Even you seem cross.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.161
Ugh.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.845
Would you mind if we got back?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.287
This path is rather wearing
on the old footwear.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.442
You didn't ask me
when the book would be ready.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.290
Get it out of your system

30:32.360 --> 30:35.443
and then come back
to your senses, will you?

30:56.080 --> 30:57.127
Shh.

30:57.200 --> 31:01.524
Daddy may be asleep.
We are very, very late.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.929
Nou.
Wait here.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.731
Get back.
Sir.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.961
Get back!

31:18.120 --> 31:19.246
I'm sorry.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.045
It's only us, sir.
Get away from me!

31:23.720 --> 31:25.245
It was just a balloon.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.404
Just don't come near me.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.041
Stay there.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.966
Come on.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.043
Quick. Quick, quick.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.249
I'm sorry we woke you, sir.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.201
Would you like one too?

32:02.440 --> 32:05.887
Just a balloon. As you say.
Can't be helped.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.290
Olive? Um...

32:11.840 --> 32:13.365
Mrs. Milne?

32:14.360 --> 32:16.408
I'm afraid she was delayed, sir.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.090
She said she'd telephone to you

32:18.160 --> 32:20.003
just as soon as
she had a moment.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.805
No, Nou, don't go! Stay!

32:41.960 --> 32:44.247
Nou! It's just for
a little while.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.488
Edward Bear will be here
to keep an eye on you.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.849
That's not even his name!
Please, Nou, don't go.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.365
You're being very unkind.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.490
Look, you've got
all these creatures.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.165
I don't want them!

32:56.320 --> 32:58.482
Billy!
I hate them!

32:58.640 --> 32:59.687
That's enough!

32:59.960 --> 33:01.485
I'm walking out of this room...

33:01.640 --> 33:03.005
...and I won't
come back in again

33:03.200 --> 33:05.965
until you have recovered
all of your nice ways.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.645
No! Don't go!

33:08.840 --> 33:09.887
Nou!

33:17.360 --> 33:19.044
I'm trying to write.
The noise, it's--

33:19.680 --> 33:21.170
Yes, sir. Sorry.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.004
I'll do my best
to calm him down, sir.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.481
He's a little upset about my going away.
Of course.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.201
You're going away?

33:27.640 --> 33:29.051
I thought Mrs. Milne
had said...

33:29.200 --> 33:30.531
Mrs. Milne
is always saying things.

33:30.640 --> 33:31.880
I don't expect them to happen.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.128
All the same, I shall be gone
for at least three nights.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.526
Thank you.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.641
Wait.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.411
Your mother.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.202
I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.725
You must go.
Of course you must.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.080
I hope she gets better.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.405
Billy is not happy
about my going-

33:55.360 --> 33:57.249
She's all the family
I have, sir,

33:57.360 --> 33:58.725
and she is very unwell.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.720
Mrs. Penn
will look after us.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.089
Mrs. Penn
is away too, sir.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.163
I did the cooking today.
Ah.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.922
Never mind.
Old soldier, you know.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.246
See to myself.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.644
So what do we like
for breakfast?

35:05.280 --> 35:06.327
Don't know.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.084
You don't know what you like?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.765
I've forgotten.
Why has she gone anyway?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.644
To buy new wallpaper and so on.

35:13.760 --> 35:14.966
To make our house look nice.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.326
Not Mummy. Nou.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.885
She's gone to see her mother

35:18.960 --> 35:20.849
who is very ill,
as you well know.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.331
You must remember her
in your prayers.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.771
What about porridge?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.126
Yes, please.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.848
I don't think
I do like porridge after all.

35:34.920 --> 35:35.921
You said that you liked--

35:36.000 --> 35:38.970
I know, but I've never had it.
I just like the sound.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.921
You've had had eggs before.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.320
Usually they're in shells.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.164
Boiled eggs. When
is she coming back?

35:46.240 --> 35:47.241
Mummy? NOU!

35:47.320 --> 35:48.321
She'll be back in three days.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.401
But of course
her mother is very ill,

35:49.480 --> 35:50.481
so it could be longer than that.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.809
I hate her! Sack her and
tell her never to come back!

35:56.000 --> 35:57.968
You ought not to hold
your knife and fork like that.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.610
Why shouldn't I?

35:59.800 --> 36:00.801
Becauseâ€œ.

36:02.800 --> 36:05.883
...if someone were to
fall through the ceiling...

36:06.040 --> 36:07.883
...they'd come down
right there

36:08.000 --> 36:10.207
and be impaled on your fork...

36:10.280 --> 36:12.726
...and then
they would bleed out

36:12.840 --> 36:14.171
all over your eggs...

36:15.040 --> 36:17.168
...and ruin your breakfast.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.566
Do you see?

36:27.400 --> 36:28.561
Better.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.686
Nou says you're writing a book
to stop people going to war.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.807
Hmm.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.006
War is rotten.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.447
I know. I was there.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.409
So I think your book
is a jolly good idea.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.609
Thank you. You're the
only one that does.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.606
I'd really like if you wrote
a book for me.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.603
I'd definitely read it.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.166
Shall we go for a walk?

37:13.240 --> 37:14.241
Aren't you working?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.925
It doesn't seem likely.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.446
Come on.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.440
A soldier shot
his mother by mistake.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.807
And that's how Winnie
ended up in the zoo

37:22.920 --> 37:24.570
with everyone staring at him.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.248
I'm going to call
my bear Winnie.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.802
It's Winnie. Short for where
he comes from. Winnipeg.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.246
Hmm.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.486
It's just bees.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.209
Maybe there's a hive.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.921
Let's stake it out.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.886
There! Up there. In the tree.
Uh-huh.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.603
You any good at climbing?

37:49.760 --> 37:51.728
Not bad.
All right.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.644
Well, give it a go.
Only be careful.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.167
Where there are bees,
there is honey

37:56.280 --> 37:58.442
and where there is honey,
there are bears.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.930
There are no bears in Sussex.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.291
Then what's...

38:04.440 --> 38:05.601
What's that?

38:06.520 --> 38:07.726
Oh, no.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.087
I think he's seen us.
We'd better capture it.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.287
Yes? Yes.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.166
GOT him!

38:14.640 --> 38:16.927
You put him up there,
didn't you?

38:17.640 --> 38:18.880
You overestimate me

38:18.960 --> 38:21.645
if you think I can
wrestle a bear into a tree.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.209
Stay alert.
Where there's one bear,

38:24.320 --> 38:26.482
there might be
a whole flock of them.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.321
Good.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.285
Mummy says
they have to have names.

38:39.480 --> 38:44.327
Well, the tiger
should be called Tiger.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.642
Tigger is better than Tiger.

38:47.840 --> 38:48.841
Better how?

38:49.480 --> 38:52.324
It's more tiggerish.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.441
Hmm.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.641
Fair enough.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.564
Make sure it's tight.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.845
You take that bit.
Can you get it through there?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.810
That's what we like!
I remember now.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.849
Pie!

39:16.680 --> 39:17.806
I say there seems to be

39:17.880 --> 39:19.803
rather a lot here
for just the two of us.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.161
Yes.
Mmm.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.004
I'm missing Daph.
You're missing Nou.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.041
Shall we ask the others in?

39:31.840 --> 39:33.251
Just this once.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.521
Some of us
don't like pie, you know.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.125
Don't like it at all.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.885
But don't let that
spoil your enjoyment.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.087
Don't worry, Eeyore.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.531
We've made special
provision for you.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.726
On!

39:47.880 --> 39:51.043
I'm sure the pie is wonderful
could one but see it!

39:51.240 --> 39:52.890
Piglet, I do apologize.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.565
That's quite all right.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.245
It's not the same
when you do the voices.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.442
It's better
when Mummy does them.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.366
I see.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.244
Now, uh...

40:06.520 --> 40:10.411
Lord, make us able to shift
the grub upon the table.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.561
Go!

40:12.720 --> 40:13.721
Mmm.

40:29.640 --> 40:30.880
Daph?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.925
Why on Earth are you still up?

40:35.120 --> 40:37.964
I wasn't sure if I was
supposed to go to bed or not.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.321
It's nearly midnight.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.641
No one put me to bed.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.286
I brushed my teeth.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.441
Have you said your prayers?

40:43.600 --> 40:44.601
Have you done your writing?

40:45.600 --> 40:46.965
Go to bed.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.489
Just written a poem.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.371
Will I like it?

41:15.520 --> 41:18.763
I should hope so. It's got
lots of rhymes in it.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.968
Is it about what tiggers eat?

41:22.040 --> 41:24.008
Why would it be about that?

41:24.360 --> 41:27.170
Just seem like
a very interesting topic.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.321
No.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.401
It's about a boy who tries
to look after his mother

41:31.480 --> 41:33.323
even though he's only three.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.050
Three is very little.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.362
But it rhymes
with lots of things.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.682
Why does she need looking after?

41:40.800 --> 41:43.371
She goes to town
without telling anyone.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.365
She goes to town
without telling anyone.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.685
She goes to town
in a golden gown...

41:52.840 --> 41:55.047
...and no one can find out
where she's gone.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.844
Never ever?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.890
King John puts up a notice

41:59.000 --> 42:00.684
offering a reward
if anyone can find her.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.524
How much reward, do you think?

42:02.680 --> 42:06.844
It needs to be a lot of money,
I suppose. 40 shillings.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.049
Forty shillings?

42:11.640 --> 42:13.324
That's quite difficult to
rhyme with though, isn't it?

42:13.400 --> 42:14.481
Shillings?

42:15.720 --> 42:16.721
Fillings.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.564
What about pounds?
Pounds?

42:18.760 --> 42:20.000
Pounds.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.161
Clowns.

42:21.320 --> 42:23.209
Well, there are clowns now.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.925
Why King John, though?

42:27.040 --> 42:29.008
Why not King Richard?
The Lionheart.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.400
He's a terrible fellow.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.528
Always off crusading,
biffing people,

42:32.600 --> 42:34.204
getting himself
taken prisoner...

42:34.400 --> 42:36.721
...and making the common people
stump up for his ransom.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.087
Besides,
he was practically French.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.605
King John stayed at home.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.686
Oh.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.450
He also took a bath every year.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.766
That's impressive.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.081
Good shot.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.241
Knees bent.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.920
Robin Hood was on
King Richard's side, though.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.610
And Robin Hood was good.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.684
Robin Hood was good

43:02.760 --> 43:05.286
but he was a very poor
judge of character.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.401
Oh!

43:06.560 --> 43:08.210
I'm Robin Hood.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.488
Robin Hood the ace batsman
gets ready to face

43:10.600 --> 43:12.125
this ball from the
demon bowler Little John.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.441
Are you ready?

43:14.040 --> 43:15.963
Four immediately, I think.
That's gone.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.605
Oh.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.764
How's this one
for a quarterstaff?

43:26.400 --> 43:27.731
Let's find out.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.281
En garde!

43:29.440 --> 43:31.966
En garde.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.721
I'm winning.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.445
Don't think so.
Test of strength. Come on.

43:41.960 --> 43:42.961
That's too hot!

43:43.080 --> 43:44.161
I knew you were
going to say that.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.765
Put that on.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.161
There we are.
How about some ice?

43:48.280 --> 43:49.281
One lump or two?

43:49.400 --> 43:50.447
Three.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.641
Two...

43:52.800 --> 43:55.007
Dear God, can you hear me?

43:55.160 --> 43:57.049
Why did you make
the bath water so hot?

43:57.120 --> 43:58.326
I nearly was boiled alive.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.448
And can you bless
Nou especially?

44:00.600 --> 44:01.965
And bring her back.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.125
Which one would you like?

44:08.280 --> 44:09.930
This one.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.002
Ready?
Yeah. Same height, please.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.161
Go!

44:16.160 --> 44:17.161
Mine's winning.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.771
No. Mine's winning.
Come on.

44:23.960 --> 44:24.961
Me! I won!

44:26.200 --> 44:27.645
Again?
Yes!

44:28.480 --> 44:29.891
This one, please.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.641
Go!

44:37.480 --> 44:38.970
Sir Billy.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.007
A swan's not really
a wild animal.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.406
Of course he is.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.528
He could break your arm.

44:45.680 --> 44:46.761
Well, what's his name?

44:46.840 --> 44:48.524
He doesn't have a name.
He's wild.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.842
But I want to call him to me.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.725
You should call him Pooh, then.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.525
So if he ignores you,

44:54.640 --> 44:57.325
you can pretend you were
just saying, "Pooh."

44:58.080 --> 44:59.081
Pooh!

45:04.240 --> 45:05.571
Who's your favorite?

45:05.880 --> 45:07.928
I'd have to go for
the little one.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.367
Piglet.
Has to be Piglet.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.607
What have you got?

45:25.760 --> 45:27.046
A frog.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.682
Careful it's not poisonous.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.567
He's tiny, isn't he?

45:50.120 --> 45:52.122
Let's be hunters in the snow.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.249
Excellent notion.

46:05.440 --> 46:08.489
Come on! Don't get frostbite.
And don't get lost.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.766
I'll help you.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.281
Oh, it's beautiful.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.771
Wow.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.007
Watch out.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.166
Look here!

46:25.120 --> 46:27.691
Whatever made this was huge.

46:27.840 --> 46:28.966
We should follow it.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.449
You sure? You sure
we shouldn't just run away?

46:32.640 --> 46:33.801
Never!

46:34.640 --> 46:35.971
All right then.

46:37.720 --> 46:38.801
Wait!

46:40.120 --> 46:41.724
No, we're all right.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.411
It's not very good

46:44.480 --> 46:45.527
at hiding its tracks.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.965
Maybe it doesn't need to.

46:47.280 --> 46:50.489
Maybe it's scarier
than any other beast.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.847
If the snow keeps falling,
we'll lose the trail.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.446
Look.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.771
We're back where we started.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.685
We've been following our
own footprints, haven't we?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.211
Sorry, Blue.

47:16.680 --> 47:17.841
Sorry.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.208
I think it's about time
for summer now, don't you?

47:41.400 --> 47:43.448
I think
Owl lives up there, you know.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.201
Does he?

47:46.040 --> 47:49.408
If you look ever so carefully,
you can see his front door.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.171
Come on, then.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.846
Where to?

48:11.560 --> 48:12.607
Home, I should think.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.091
- Ernest?
- Milne?

48:20.160 --> 48:21.764
I think I've got
something for us.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.411
Tigger is in a cage?

48:29.560 --> 48:31.130
He doesn't really belong here

48:31.240 --> 48:33.083
and there's no one
quite like him...

48:33.240 --> 48:35.004
...so he gets confused
and a bit scary.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.769
A cage is a bit harsh, though.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.127
Fantastic cage though, eh?

48:40.360 --> 48:41.725
Billy made it.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.684
Blue is teaching me woodwork.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.160
He's the best at it.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.322
He should do woodwork
instead of books.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.289
Hey!

48:53.080 --> 48:56.289
There it is. Up there!
That's where Owl lives.

48:56.920 --> 48:58.809
How you gonna get it up there?

48:58.880 --> 49:00.882
I don't know.
Simple.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.766
Blow these up.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.206
When we have enough,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.123
we'll float you up
to the branch.

49:29.640 --> 49:32.371
One, two, three!

49:34.200 --> 49:35.281
Oh.

49:35.360 --> 49:38.170
I think we probably need
more floaty breath.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.483
Floaty breath. Milne, what
are you gonna do about it?

49:41.680 --> 49:44.604
Maybe if we brushed our teeth
more thoroughly. Eh?

50:03.080 --> 50:04.081
Yes!

50:13.720 --> 50:14.721
Is this really--

50:31.760 --> 50:32.966
Is he home?

50:33.200 --> 50:34.440
This is paradise.

50:35.840 --> 50:36.887
Owl? Are you home?

50:37.040 --> 50:39.042
Just get everything you can.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.051
We'll pick and choose later.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.770
Can I come in for tea?

50:46.760 --> 50:48.091
Just do a little shading.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.607
You see, that's better with
the light, how it comes down.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.763
What is the name of this chap?

50:52.920 --> 50:54.285
Piglet.
Piglet?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.571
Now as you see, he's
looking a little bit glum there.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.930
This one is scary.

51:01.760 --> 51:04.764
Well, it's not meant to be.
It's you and Winnie Bear.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.206
But that's not Winnie Bear,

51:06.280 --> 51:08.965
that's Winnie,
short for Winnipeg.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.406
I've only seen him in the zoo.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.050
Yes. Good point.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.805
Good point.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.049
The creatures
in the story are toys.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.610
They're toys
but the woods are real.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.841
And the size is wrong.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.241
The bear should be smaller.
Size of a little brother.

51:28.400 --> 51:29.606
There.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.086
Yes, that's it.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.605
Blue, are we writing a book?

51:32.680 --> 51:34.250
I thought
we were just having fun.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.807
We are writing a book
and we're having fun.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.962
I didn't know you could
do both at the same time.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.321
You don't usually look like

51:40.440 --> 51:41.771
you're having fun
while you're writing.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.968
It's not your turn, Tigger.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.490
This is more than a few poems.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.325
Mmm. It's a little world.

52:06.120 --> 52:08.441
Like you said,
a hundred-acre paradise.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.601
Shh.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.160
Be very, very quiet.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.685
"Vespers."

52:16.240 --> 52:18.049
This one is for Daphne.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.845
Look, Blue. Smoke!

52:31.120 --> 52:32.451
Intruders!

52:33.320 --> 52:35.049
To arms, gentlemen!

52:35.200 --> 52:38.807
It's not intruders. It's Nou!
It must be. Nou!

52:38.960 --> 52:41.281
- Might not be.
- Billy Moon.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.726
Hello!

52:44.880 --> 52:47.326
Oh, Mrs. Milne,

52:47.440 --> 52:49.727
we've missed you terribly.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.004
Life in the countryside
is so limited.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.686
Yes, well, I did notice that.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.605
So I brought some friends back
from the city with me to stay.

52:58.840 --> 53:01.161
Have you seen
my little Jimmy anywhere?

53:01.360 --> 53:03.886
Joey! Baby kangaroos
are called Joey.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.851
Not this one.
His name is Roo.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.731
I'm Kanga and this is Roo.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.046
Where's Nanny?

53:13.320 --> 53:14.321
I don't understand.
You mean to say

53:14.400 --> 53:16.926
it was just the two of you
this whole time?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.525
How absurd.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.049
Are we to know
where you've been?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.326
Oh, good heavens no.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.765
I mean, what would be the point?

53:27.040 --> 53:30.567
The great thing is I'm back now.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.762
Don't you think?

53:33.040 --> 53:35.566
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I do.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.411
You see?

53:44.560 --> 53:47.040
Yes, I think I do see.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.568
I sent you a poem I wrote.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.646
About the boy.

53:53.720 --> 53:55.848
Yes, I read it.
It was very sweet.

53:56.360 --> 53:57.930
Just a bit of a lark.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.644
I sent it off to be published.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.081
What?

54:04.240 --> 54:05.605
Well, it made me happy.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.643
Thought it might make
lots of people happy.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.211
Published by whom?

54:11.080 --> 54:12.923
Vanity Fair.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.125
They were very pleased with it.

54:15.240 --> 54:16.605
Isn't it rather wonderful?

54:18.040 --> 54:19.041
Well.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.041
That is rather wonderful.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.164
It's their biggest selling issue

54:24.280 --> 54:26.282
for simply ages, apparently.

54:26.440 --> 54:29.330
People are buying extra copies
to give to their friends.

54:30.440 --> 54:32.647
Perhaps I should ask
Ernest back down.

54:34.720 --> 54:37.451
Ernest and I are
putting your bear in a book.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.085
He'll like that.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.171
We're putting you in it too.
Will you like that?

54:42.320 --> 54:44.482
I'm not sure.
If I'm in a book,

54:44.600 --> 54:46.489
people might think I'm not real.

54:46.560 --> 54:47.686
Well, then it will be a surprise

54:47.760 --> 54:48.761
when they find out you are real.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.804
And when they find out
Winnie is real?

54:51.960 --> 54:53.450
We can't call him
Winnie in the book,

54:53.600 --> 54:55.170
because Winnie is a girl's name.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.845
No. It's a bear's name.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.964
It's different for bears.
Nou says.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.770
I like names with "the."

55:01.920 --> 55:03.081
William the Conqueror,

55:03.160 --> 55:05.481
Richard the Lionheart,
Joanna the Mad.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.766
You made her up.

55:06.920 --> 55:09.969
I certainly did not. She
was the queen of Spain.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.161
Winnie the Bear.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.288
Everyone knows
he's a bear already.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.681
He wasn't called
Richard the King, was he?

55:15.800 --> 55:17.165
Or Billy the Moon.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.606
But you're not the moon.

55:18.760 --> 55:19.921
Christopher the Robin.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.121
I'm not a robin either.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.486
What will you call me
in the book?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.287
Not Billy Moon because
that's what we call you.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.441
It'll be confusing.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.522
But if I'm really in the book.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.850
Christopher Robin, then...

55:32.000 --> 55:33.650
...because it's
your real name,

55:33.720 --> 55:35.802
but it's not who you really are.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.201
You all right, old man?

56:03.400 --> 56:05.368
Those fields in France...

56:07.040 --> 56:09.202
...they'll look like this now,
won't they?

56:09.760 --> 56:11.728
As though it never happened.

56:13.320 --> 56:14.367
Blue...

56:15.040 --> 56:17.566
...when I'm grown up,
how old will you be?

56:18.040 --> 56:19.246
About 100, I should think.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.011
On!

56:23.080 --> 56:25.890
There's an echo!
Come and hear.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.281
Hello!

56:30.880 --> 56:31.881
Hello!

56:34.040 --> 56:35.451
My name is Blue!

56:36.920 --> 56:38.081
Who are you?

56:38.920 --> 56:40.570
I'm Billy Moon!

56:41.400 --> 56:43.164
And I'll be back soon!

57:00.240 --> 57:01.366
Ernest...

57:02.240 --> 57:03.241
...look.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.171
Does he need a hat?

57:30.320 --> 57:31.446
Certainly not.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.449
Winnie the Pooh is
a creature of bedtime.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.602
He's either just got up
or just going off.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.444
He's reverie in bear form.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.644
Winnie the Pooh.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.441
That's rather...

57:42.640 --> 57:43.971
inexplicable?
Yes.

57:44.120 --> 57:46.805
Which is a good thing.
Is it a good thing?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.126
Yes.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.645
Winnie the Pooh.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.922
She's here! She's here!
She's here!

57:56.000 --> 57:58.048
Good heavens, who is it?
Queen Mary?

57:58.320 --> 58:00.129
It's only been two weeks.

58:00.720 --> 58:01.801
Nou!

58:04.320 --> 58:05.287
Have you missed me?

58:05.400 --> 58:07.721
- Yes!
- Sorry it was a bit longer than I said.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.723
We put a door in a tree
using balloons.

58:09.840 --> 58:11.888
I was terribly sorry to hear
the news about your mother.

58:13.840 --> 58:17.049
Thank you, sir.
She's gone to a better place.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.289
I saw the "Vespers" poem.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.886
About his prayers.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.242
Hanging on the wall
of a friend's living room.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.926
They'd ripped it out of
the magazine and framed it.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.491
Apparently, a lot of people
are doing that.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.324
Well, that is just
the beginning.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.205
He has been terribly,
brilliantly busy.

58:45.880 --> 58:47.564
"And he helped
to get the others...

58:47.840 --> 58:48.966
"His huge big waterproof...

58:50.960 --> 58:52.450
- Who's this?
- Tigger!

58:58.400 --> 58:59.686
Thank you, Mr. Milne.
Thank you very much.

59:04.440 --> 59:07.364
I say! You're most awfully
good at climbing trees.

59:07.800 --> 59:09.211
Who are you?

59:09.360 --> 59:11.362
Stay exactly like that.
Lovely.

59:11.440 --> 59:12.965
Like a wood spirit.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.041
Excuse me!

59:14.920 --> 59:17.810
Oh, Brown. Mary Brown.
The Times.

59:17.960 --> 59:21.726
Good heavens, you must be
Nanny. As in "Vespers."

59:21.880 --> 59:23.370
The nanny with
the blue dressing gown.

59:23.440 --> 59:24.441
The one that God blesses!

59:25.760 --> 59:27.569
I'd just as soon not,
if you don't mind.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.404
Billy, come down.

59:29.480 --> 59:31.005
If you'd like to
speak to Mr. Milne,

59:31.080 --> 59:33.242
please be so good as to telephone
to him and make an appointment.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.721
But I don't want to speak
to Mr. Milne, you see.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.763
I want to speak
to Christopher Robin.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.487
I'm afraid that won't
be possible today.

59:41.880 --> 59:43.245
Billy, let's go. Why
do you call him Billy?

59:44.120 --> 59:45.281
My proper name is Milne

59:45.480 --> 59:47.687
but when I was small,
it came out Moon.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.446
I'm good at coming down
trees too. Did you notice?

59:50.520 --> 59:51.521
Oh, I did.

59:51.920 --> 59:55.481
I also noticed that you have
cardboard tied to your legs.

59:55.640 --> 59:56.641
In case of dragons.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.570
You don't know where
I can get some of

59:58.640 --> 59:59.971
that dragon-proof
cardboard, do you?

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.168
That's enough, dear. It's such
a bother when the dragons

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.930
set fire to my stockings.
Good day to you.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.451
Did you get it?
Sorry.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.521
From The Times?

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.481
Well, that's rather good.
Don't you think that's good?

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.561
No, ma'am.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.087
I can't say I do.
The boy is happy here and--

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.961
Sorry, ma'am.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.600
Sorry, sir.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.851
Yes, The Times is very good.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.167
Hello?

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.364
The Evening News wants to put
Winnie on the front page.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.250
- Yes, that'd be fine.
- Are you sure?

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.401
Yes, I think so.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.210
That's marvelous.
Thank you so much.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.087
They're not for you, sir.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.325
They're nearly all for
Master Christopher.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.401
I see that.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.206
I wonder if I might ask,
sir, if in future...

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.840
...you couldn't come to the
post office and collect them?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.731
Only there being so many,
it's hard to keep my balance.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.369
Of course.
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.684
For Christopher Robin.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.604
But I'm not really
Christopher Robin.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.011
For the animals then.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.730
But they don't eat chocolate.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.768
I do, though.
And so does Nou.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.723
Who is Nou?
She's Nanny.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.001
Nanny is real too?

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.646
Of course she's real.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.690
I tried ever so hard
to save some for you.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.730
You saved three.
That's very good.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.360
Why does everyone like
Winnie the Pooh so much?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.646
He's my bear.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.041
Why don't they get
their own bears?

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.041
Well...

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.451
You see, after the war
there was so much sadness...

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.125
...that hardly anyone
could remember

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.690
what happiness was like.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.484
Then Winnie the Pooh came along

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.244
and he was like a tap.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.448
You just turned it on
and happiness came out.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.769
But I'm not Christopher Robin,
really. I'm Billy Moon.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.046
That's right.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.885
And you don't have to
share me with anybody.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.041
Except Mummy.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.049
Yes, but that's only
a little bit.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.451
Uh-huh.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.929
Come on, Christopher Robin.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.607
Give him a cuddle.
He is your daddy after all.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.641
Oh, come on, Mr. Milne.
A little affection, please.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.764
Surely he can't be expected
to answer all of these.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.571
It's a lovely day outside
and I thought that we could--

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.886
Could we go to the woods?

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.401
I've got heaps of
writing to do, I'm afraid.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.921
Perhaps later.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.641
People of Ashdown...

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.323
...I give you
Queen Elizabeth the First.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.291
King Henry the Eighth.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.965
Boudicca.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.011
Lord Nelson.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.325
And now, a little boy
and his bear...

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.008
...who will be forever playing
somewhere in our hearts.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.963
I give you some of the
most important people...

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.681
...who ever visited
this magnificent forest.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.444
I can assure you,
Druckers Tea Rooms

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.646
do an excellent fruitcake.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.848
I don't quite approve of
fruitcake except at weddings.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.961
Nou, was I good?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.009
Oh. Ever so ever so.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.848
Shall we all go for tea?

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.490
No, thanks.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.241
Billy!

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.449
That was a bit rude.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.208
Once upon a time,
a boy might want to be

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.647
Huckleberry Finn
rafting down the Mississippi.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.326
Now, he wants to be
Christopher Robin

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.846
playing in the
Hundred Acre Wood.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.606
One little boy though really
is Christopher Robin.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.926
And here he is.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.651
In England's
Ashdown Forest itself,

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.007
the home of the real
Winnie the Pooh.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.843
Surely, this is the happiest
young man on Earth.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.684
And here's his
mother and father.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.080
They're here in America

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.889
to promote
the latest adventures...

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.088
of the most fashionable
bear in the world-

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.566
Mrs. Milne,
what's the first thing

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.886
you want to do in America?

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.769
Well, I should love to
go to a speakeasy.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.010
Mrs. Milne is joking,
of course.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.849
She knows that
speakeasies are illegal.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.923
Of course I know
they're illegal.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.724
That's what makes them fun.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.001
Really?

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.570
Oh. No, thank you.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.644
I can't believe
I'm talking to the father

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.125
of the real Christopher Robin.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.601
Well, you know, the boy in the
book isn't exactly my son.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.006
But his name
is Christopher Robin

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.320
and he does like to climb trees?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.481
Yes, that's true,
but we don't--

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.246
I imagine you making up all
those stories at his bedside--

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.801
That's wonderful. Excuse me,
I must find my wife.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.883
Have a lovely evening.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.049
Isn't it all marvelous.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.521
It's just like London
but with more money.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.006
I thought when
people liked a book,

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.605
it was the author
they sucked up to.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.923
All anyone wants to talk about
is Christopher Robin. Watch.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.001
Hello.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.487
I know you'll be
talking to the real

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.561
Christopher Robin tomorrow...

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.768
...and I wondered
if you could wish him

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.531
a happy birthday
from all his American fans?

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.921
Hmm.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.371
One arm.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.521
Two.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.761
What's that?

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.600
Downstairs and answer
the door, young man.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.046
You're master of the house.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.201
Who is it?

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.281
Surprise.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.005
Mummy and Daddy!

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.243
Well now, it might not be
Mummy and Daddy.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.843
Oh, my jolly golly.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.045
Did you like that,
Christopher Robin?

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.851
Should you like them
to play again?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.006
Do I, Nou? Do I want
them to play again?

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.361
I should think you do.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.442
They're a present
from Mummy and Daddy.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.728
Happy Birthday, Billy Moon.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.367
We had a wonderful day.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.249
I'm working on the tree house.
It's nearly done.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.891
So you had a Happy Birthday?

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.964
The best ever.
We had sausages in the woods.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.885
But it's been raining.
Raining and raining.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.008
Nou says we might
have to build an ark.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.730
Well, don't go
messing up my too/shed.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.729
Oh, no, I think
she was making a joke.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.080
When will you be home?

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.606
I'll be back before you can
say Jack Robinson.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.807
Jack Robinson.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.002
I already said it
and you're not back.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.607
You know Nou is
terribly bad at bowling.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.605
And I'm afraid I'm not getting
enough practice in the nets.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.250
Sadly, we're
running out of time.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.925
Happy Birthday,
Christopher Robin.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.570
You've been listening
to Mr. A.A. Milne,

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.641
author of Winnie the Pooh...

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.769
...and father of the actual
Christopher Robin.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.206
Imagine that.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.011
Gentlemen, do you want

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.289
that barbershop shave from
the comfort of your own home?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.250
I don't understand.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.562
Why was there
someone else talking?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.961
And why did he call me
Christopher Robin?

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.168
He never calls me
Christopher Robin.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.722
Get your great big
waterproof boots.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.120
But it's the middle
of the night.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:36.009
Two, three, four, five, six.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.128
Now.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.729
I think it's time
Little Billy Moon

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.246
got better acquainted
with Big Moon himself.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.525
Pooh Sticks?

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.167
Noises. There are
nighttime noises.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.924
That's because it's nighttime.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.411
Don't worry.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.081
Ready?

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.521
Yes.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.321
Go!

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.526
A person should do
the things a person loves

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.602
with the people
a person loves...

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.491
...because you never know
what happens next.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Hmm.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.286
What a very agile wolf.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.770
Do you think a giraffe
would be happy

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.046
with a wolf on his back?

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.171
Oh, look who's here!

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.000
Blue!

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:37.401
Mummy!

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.002
Hello! How are you,
old chap?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.207
I'm good.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:43.850
Oh, you look such a duck!

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.444
Didn't I say he'd look a duck?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.370
We're going to have
such times, Moon.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:49.568
Shall we go to the woods?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.483
The woods will have to wait.
What do you think of this?

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.640
It's very shiny.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.770
It's been sent to take us
somewhere special in London.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.126
You're not staying?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.846
No, we're just here
to collect Billy.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.001
Go get changed. Quick.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.966
How do you do,
Mr. Christopher Robin?

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.399
My name is Mr. Elliot

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.687
and I am the manager
of this fine toy shop.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.330
What's a manager?

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.562
Well, I suppose I make
all the decisions.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.246
I said let's have
a grand competition...

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:21.483
...to win tea with
the real Christopher Robin...

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.448
...and the real
Winnie the Pooh.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.241
No. It's not real.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.161
It's a lie!

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:28.651
Excuse us.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.529
You're the luckiest boy
in the world

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.363
because you know
the real Winnie the Pooh.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.450
Most people have to make do
with a pretend one.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.209
You can make do
just this once, can't you?

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.129
Are you my manager then?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:45.569
Whatever gave you such
a notion? I'm your mother.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.285
I have an idea.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.680
Why don't we do something
ever so ever so now?

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.921
Don't do Winnie's voice
when it's not Winnie.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.850
It's nothing like Winnie.
It's not even real.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.570
Why is he called
Winnie the Pooh?

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.245
Well, there was a swan

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.409
and I wanted to call it,
and Blue...

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.403
I mean, A.A. Milne.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.441
I mean, Daddy said if you call
it Pooh and it doesn't come...

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.365
...you can just pretend
you were saying "pooh."

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.004
So it's not a real name?

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.730
My bear has a different name
in real life.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.928
And I've got a different name
in real life.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.401
And there's no good asking
because we shan't tell.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.006
They're our names
and we're keeping them.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.364
This one is from Samoa.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.051
Is there anywhere in the world

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.884
where they haven't heard
of Winnie the Pooh?

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.011
Perhaps the Highveld.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.208
Can I go to the Highveld?

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.209
Don't you just look perfect.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.481
Ah, Nanny.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.131
A quick word.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.765
I thought you might wear this.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.087
It has panache, don't you think?

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.889
Like the one the Nanny wears
in Mr. Milne's poem.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.246
Yes, exactly.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.283
We don't want people
to be disappointed

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.691
because you don't look the way
you do in the book.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.126
I'm not in the book, ma'am.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.850
The nanny in the book
is called Alice.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.169
Only because
it rhymes with palace.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.324
Unlike "Nanny" which rhymes
with nothing polite.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.244
Are people going
to look at us, Nou?

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.931
Like they look at
Winnie the Bear in the zoo?

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.484
No, Moon,
I don't think they are...

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.889
...because we are
going to go in disguise.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.720
Thank you very much for
this interesting conversation.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.927
Thank you, Master Christopher.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.087
Goodbye.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.249
Well done. That's the last
interview for today.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.209
Read me a story.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.842
I just read you your story.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.924
And we said prayers, so...

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.360
...goodnight.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.002
Where are you going?
You look different.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.765
Why do you look different?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.921
Give me a cuddle.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.809
We've already had
a perfectly lovely cuddle.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.610
Now it's my night off.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.330
The laborer has earned her rest.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.561
Goodnight.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.166
Good evening.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.284
Good evening to you!

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.846
So where are you taking me?

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.605
I thought
we'd go to an Italian place.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.371
Thank you God
for another bright day,

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.090
and now it's time to get up.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.489
I'm not getting up.
I'm not going to school.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.926
Oh, now. Come along.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.451
Where's my brave knight

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.010
who fights dragons
and climbs trees?

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.606
There are no dragons.
There are no trees.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.489
Nobody loves me!
You don't love me!

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.289
That's simply not true.
You know I love you.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.442
You love Alfred!

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.567
I love you both.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.808
Don't marry him, Nou.
Marry me!

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.564
Please marry me.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.081
Now, let's get dressed.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.646
Come along.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.769
Quicker, come on!

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.805
Well, are you going to tell us?

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.645
Olive is getting married.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.046
She didn't inform me.
Billy did.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.929
I don't think
Billy needs to hear this.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.641
Why not? You've betrayed him
as much as you've betrayed us.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.765
Billy, go to your room, dear.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.811
When is the happy
event, by the way?

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.367
There's no date set
as yet, ma'am.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.369
But there is a gentleman?
There is an understanding.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.691
There's a gentleman,

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.770
but no understanding
as such as yet.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.840
I see.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.727
Well, may we be the first
to congratulate you.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.006
Yes.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.446
What's his name?

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.681
Alfred.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.126
He's a good man.
I never imagined--

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.930
Now we know why
Billy has been so unhappy.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.126
It seems the person
we've been paying

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.247
to keep him happy...

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.328
...has been rather preoccupied
with her own happiness.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.129
Daphne. I feel it's
time we start doing

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.202
what's best for Billy Moon.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.924
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.128
Because if I could
speak frankly, sir--

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.725
You most certainly may not.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.325
That would be
highly unprofessional.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.282
Then I'll retire
from my profession

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.481
with immediate notice.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.165
I'm sure that won't
be necessary.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.285
Sir, I don't think you've been
doing what's right for Billy.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.850
Not at all.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.570
You've been touting him around

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.483
like a show pony,
hawking your books.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.926
Now, just a minute.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.406
He has to be allowed to grow up.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.881
He has to know he's
important to someone.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.128
That someone cares about him.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.401
Cares?

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.251
I gave birth to him.
He nearly killed me.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.051
With respect, ma'am,
a cow can give birth.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.969
I think you know all this,
sir, but you let it go.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.043
And that's not right.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.209
A father should
stand up for his son.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.402
That's quite enough. I think
I've seen you catch his eye...

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.210
...and turn away.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.887
You can't turn away anymore.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.690
Still awake?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.330
Want a story?

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.401
Yes.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.526
Once upon a time,
there was a nanny...

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.361
...who looked after
a little boy.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.966
A very special little boy.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.682
She loved him so much...

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.726
...that she carried him
in her heart...

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.249
...and in her prayers.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.086
And she hoped and prayed...

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.087
...and prayed and hoped that
he would always remember...

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.246
...me.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.528
Be happy, Billy Moon.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.322
Keep your memories
and I'll keep mine.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.446
And that way
we'll always be together.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.606
Olive.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.846
His appointments for the week.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.283
You're going to be quite busy.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.641
Nou?!

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.761
Nou?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.046
Don't blub, Billy.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.850
You know we don't blub
in this house.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.281
Nou!

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.849
Have you seen this?

01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.761
Radio interview.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.162
Newspaper interview,
House of Lords

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.844
to meet the Lords and Ladies,
photograph.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.126
He can't do all this.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.526
He can. He's rather good
at it, apparently.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.204
He's a little boy.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.126
How have we let this happen?

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.770
He should be running around
in the woods.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.002
What's your favorite,
favorite animal

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.605
in the whole wide zoo?

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.245
Wildebeest.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.241
You astound me.
Why wildebeest?

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.169
Because they live
on the Highveld.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.169
And that's where
I'd like to live.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.521
Mr. Milne,
so good to see you.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.886
And Christopher Robin

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.530
is such a good friend
of the zoo.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.806
We've had an idea.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.928
It really will be
a superb picture.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.808
Quite safe.
So long as you don't make

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.291
any sudden moves, young man.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.281
So good for the zoo.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.601
Is it good for Billy?

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.325
It's all right, Blue.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.003
Smile, Christopher Robin.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.400
That's enough, I think.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.481
Bring him out.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.285
Could we go for ice cream now?

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.609
I normally get ice cream
after a photograph.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.841
Excuse me,
are you--

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.088
No. No, he's not.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.685
Yes, he is.
He was.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.006
He's not anymore.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.890
I don't understand.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.685
Excuse us, please.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.041
Come on, Billy.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.571
Come in, Billy.
Close the door.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.924
I've made a decision and I'd like
you to be the first to know.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.731
I'm not going to write
about Christopher Robin again.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.968
Or Winnie the Pooh, or Tigger,
or any of them.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.729
Not another word.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.126
Does this mean

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.929
Winnie the Pooh
will be just us again?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.809
Winnie the Pooh
is in the world now.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.484
I can't take him out of it.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.961
But I promise I'll never write
another line about him.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.842
And you will never
have to dress up

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.967
as Christopher Robin...

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.724
...or hold a fake teddy bear

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.689
or have your photograph taken
for the papers...

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.650
...or have tea with Lords
and Ladies ever again.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.406
And the day will come,
it won't be long...

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.803
...when everyone will have
forgotten all about Winnie.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.003
There's sure to be some other
craze along any minute.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.521
Us? We won't forget him, though?

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.891
Not likely.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.081
You don't even have to stay in
London, come to think of it.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.767
Plenty of trees
to climb out here.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.446
It's a castle.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.045
And no Christopher Robin...

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.289
...and no Winnie the Pooh.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.885
It's very good of you
to let us fetch up

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.530
in the middle of term like this.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.364
No explanation required.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.484
First things first.
How's your cricket?

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.806
Ah.
I'm not sure.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.647
I've only really played
with Blue. I like woodwork.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.761
Come!

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.601
Ah.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.445
Let me introduce you
to Douglas Minor.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.251
This is Milne.
Douglas Minor will keep

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.049
an eye on you
until you've settled in.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.401
Hello.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.086
That's really kind of you,
Douglas Minor.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.448
This is him.
Looks like a girl, doesn't he?

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.729
"Christopher Robin",
if we offer to throttle you,

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.881
will you say your prayers?

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.961
Leave me alone.
Shut up.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.521
Nobody cares, nobody cares

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.808
Christopher Robin
got shoved down the stairs

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.530
Nobody cares, nobody cares

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.250
Christopher Robin
got shoved down the stairs

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.970
Nobody cares, nobody cares

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.048
Christopher Robin
got shoved down the stairs

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.683
Watch out, Christopher Robin.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.561
MILITARY MEDICI Over there.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.201
Next.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.806
Name?

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.200
Owen, Alexander.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.886
Strip, cough, over there.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.041
Next.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.080
Name?

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.890
Milne. Christopher.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.689
Strip, cough. Over there.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.401
Next!

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.881
Strip there.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.569
Look rather splendid,
don't they?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.843
I was in the last war.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.607
The War to End All Wars.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.206
Yes. Well, that didn't work,
it seems.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.721
Thank God.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.766
Rotten luck.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.249
I'm sure you'll find another
way to do your bid.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.129
Oh, what nonsense.
Blue.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.770
Let's all go home, shall we?

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.121
Alan!

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.764
Town council's orders.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.844
Take down all road signs
to confuse potential invaders.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.048
Hitler won't be able
to ransack Uckfield

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.770
if he can't find it.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.523
All right. There we are.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.647
Excellent.
Winnie does his bit.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.490
He always hated the fascists,
you know.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.246
Do stop talking
about that blasted bear.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.008
I want to join up, Blue.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.322
I want the chance
to be Private Milne.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.050
607841 or whatever.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.565
Anonymous.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.485
A real person.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.601
You failed the medical.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.723
You can get me in.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:00.921
No.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.407
You're one of the best
loved men in the country.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.642
I helped you become that.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.802
Now it's your turn to help me.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.130
I don't see
what good this is going to do

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.361
when the Nazis come.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.648
The Nazis are not
coming to Cotchford.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.161
They might drop a bomb
on it accidentally.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.049
Well, let's hope you're right.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.771
And let's hope you're ready
to defend my honor

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.081
when they lay siege
to East Grinstead.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:37.921
Yes.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.123
Well, I think it's time for me
to pot my geraniums.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.085
Daph not coming?

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.123
She couldn't. She...

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.971
Can't stand to see me
in my uniform.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.081
Yes.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.245
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.925
Me first. They say you
should get everything

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.331
straight before
you go away, in case.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.766
You're going to
get through this.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.330
That bear made my life a misery.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.320
I know it was difficult.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.289
Basic training
was the same as school.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.601
No matter what I do,

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.808
someone finds out
and then... hell.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.202
As soon as I understood,
I stopped writing it.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.486
What else could I do?

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.927
Nothing.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.130
I just want to be
clear before...

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.521
Right. Well.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.721
When I w--

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.008
When I was Billy Moon...

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.323
...we played in the woods...

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.324
...and then you wrote that
book and it all stopped.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.450
As if it had all been
a piece of research.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.761
You never came back.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.887
That's not true.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.008
We played cricket, didn't we?

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.761
Lots of cricket.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.287
I was rubbish at it.
You were mostly cross.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.487
No.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.923
What about the time you bowled
out their captain for a duck?

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.242
That was the one time.
They gave me the ball.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.366
Here. It's for you.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.641
Oh.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.881
Those days,
just the two of us...

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.291
...they were the happiest
I've ever known.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.964
After the worst I've ever known.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.602
Yes. I know.
But you sold them.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.768
You know, you did ask me
to write a book for you.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.004
A book for me, not about me.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.047
Wait!

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.561
Don't go.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.086
No, don't.
Please, Blue, don't! Not yet.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.321
Please.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.811
Until you open it,
it hasn't happened.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.723
Don't you dare blub.

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.566
He didn't have to go.
You fixed it for him.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.404
How could you do that?

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.245
What kind of father
would do that?!

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.766
About the money.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.922
The money
we earn from "that bear".

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.764
There's mountains of it.
I was thinking--

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.842
I don't want
any of it. Ever.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.128
It's a fortune.
You helped make it.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.611
It was just as much
your doing as mine.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.681
No, it wasn't.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.400
I was just playing
with my father.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.645
If I take the money for it,

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.290
then I have to be
Christopher Robin...

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.442
...and I'm not
Christopher Robin.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.601
You're Billy Moon.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.681
No.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.049
I'm Private Milne.
Never been happier.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.330
You know, I never wanted fame

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.528
or the brass band
on my birthday.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.808
What did you want?

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.486
I wanted you, Blue.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.801
Mr. Milne.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.566
Alfred. Good to see you, sir.
Come in.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.289
I brought it here for her.
She thought you wouldn't mind.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.921
I'll get her.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.441
Olive!

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.205
Mr. Milne!

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.882
How lovely to see you.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.211
Oh, dear God.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.641
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.571
So sorry, sir.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.124
He's not even mine.
He's yours.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.806
Hello, Blue.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.327
Well, if it isn't Billy Moon.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.891
Kettle on?

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.565
They told us you were dead.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.121
Did they?

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.370
Missing presumed...

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.802
I'm afraid we rather
jumped to conclusions.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.291
Mother not too worried, I hope.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.321
Billy Moon.

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.080
How very...

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.370
...unexpected.

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.730
I mean to say...

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.330
...are you really here?

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.609
I believe so.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.964
For heaven's sake, Blue,
take his bag.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.121
He must be exhausted.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.441
All that fighting.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.761
Straight away.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.881
Hello.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.251
There it all is.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.961
Just as I left it.
As if nothing had happened.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.801
When I came back,
everything seemed wrong.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.603
I didn't fit anywhere.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.124
Until I came here.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.643
Those days with you...

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.965
...I wanted
to keep them all.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.685
Put them in a box.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.330
The things that I said
before I left...

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.164
They were all true.

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.291
You're here.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.446
That's all that matters.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.806
In the desert,
we were under fire...

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.882
...and one of the men
started singing

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.724
one of the hums of Pooh.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.522
He changed
the words a bit, but...

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.201
You know.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.965
And I thought, "How on Earth
do you know that song?"

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.485
And then I remembered...

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.165
...everyone on Earth
knows that song.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.486
Everyone on Earth
knows that song.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.971
But I knew it first.

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.961
It was mine before
it was anyone else's.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.121
Then I gave it away.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.164
When they were singing,
they were remembering.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.367
It was like a magic charm...

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.844
...it took them home to
a fireside and a storybook.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.529
You did that.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.889
Thank you.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:55.526
I'm sorry you paid
the price for it.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.882
If I'd known, perhaps I...

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.850
What? Not written it? No.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:05.171
You reminded people
what happiness was...

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.810
...what childhood could be

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.041
when everything else was broken.

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.201
But your own childhood.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.447
Was wonderful.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.082
It was growing up that was hard.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.244
Who would have guessed
that bear would swallow us up?

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.526
Exactly.

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.728
This was all ours, wasn't it?

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.769
Before it was anyone else's.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:33.921
Yes.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.249
And it always will be.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.285
Come on, then.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.611
Where?

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.928
Home, I should think.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.765
Blue, when I'm grown up,
how old will you be?

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.450
About a hundred.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.766
There's an echo. Listen.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.128
I'm Billy Moon!

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.970
I'm Billy Moon!

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.648
And I'll be back soon!

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.082
There's not actually an echo,
though, is there?

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.566
I don't think there isn't.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.369
I think it was better up there.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.090
Maybe if it's more percussive.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.810
Maybe if it's more--
Ooh, there you go!

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.280
Like a train going off track.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.647
Yes.
We've lost him.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.371
Boo!
Ah, there it is.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.521
That was quite good.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.211
People are getting...
There's something wrong.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.931
You always stir my imagination

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.362
Sometimes it borders on fantasy

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.323
And sometimes
I find visions flash

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.601
Through my mind close to reality

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:42.761
Night, a soft guitar
a hidden lane

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.967
A moon and here and there a star

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.563
For a man and his dream

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:02.806
Night a cricket's cry
a whispered word

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:07.244
A kiss and now and then a sigh

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.325
For a man and his dream

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.086
And their eyes when they meet

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.085
Seem to say it's sublime

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.845
And their hearts proudly beat

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.685
To a tune
that is older than time

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:42.324
Night must fade away
and yet it leaves a love

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.126
So all the world will say

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:54.164
There's a man and his dream
