01:38.465 --> 01:40.592
<i>When look at the great pyramid...</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:44.700
<i>the marvel there for me
is not the stonework...</i>

01:45.004 --> 01:48.963
<i>as much as the level of organization...</i>

01:49.642 --> 01:52.133
<i>that these ancient Egyptians had...</i>

01:52.745 --> 01:56.545
<i>getting this society
to pul together in such a way...</i>

01:56.616 --> 01:59.414
<i>that they not only had blocks of stone...</i>

01:59.719 --> 02:01.619
<i>but bread on the table.</i>

02:03.723 --> 02:06.419
<i>Stone setters were al fairly accomplished.</i>

02:07.060 --> 02:08.823
<i>Very good craftsmen.</i>

02:12.398 --> 02:13.763
<i>lt isn't surprising...</i>

02:13.833 --> 02:17.701
<i>they had such a long history,
thousands of years doing this.</i>

02:21.908 --> 02:25.901
<i>Meet me in 20 minutes
at the old Webendorfer factory parking lot.</i>

02:28.381 --> 02:29.780
<i>The real gigantic pyramids...</i>

02:29.849 --> 02:33.546
<i>were built within the space of
about three, maybe four generations.</i>

02:36.256 --> 02:37.723
Jesus Christ!

02:44.297 --> 02:46.458
It's true, they're gonna start a draft.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.558
There's no way I'm going in the army.

02:48.968 --> 02:52.665
Yeah, 'cause his old man'd
put a horse's head in some senator's bed.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.041
- Insert foot in mouth, Jason.
- No big.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.836
<i>Ever get paranoid they'II, like,
shoot up your house like in Godfather l?</i>

02:59.913 --> 03:03.679
- Probably got armed guards at night.
- That shit doesn't happen anymore.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.151
- You have attack dogs on the property.
- No.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.989
I mean, we did, but she got hit by a car.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.255
Jason said your old man's
mostly legit now, anyway.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.920
Yeah, like what?

03:17.597 --> 03:20.361
- He's in waste management.
- Garbage?

03:20.466 --> 03:21.797
Recycling.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.303
What about drugs and prostitution and shit?

03:25.405 --> 03:26.463
No.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.398
- His dad owns a strip club, though.
- Let's go.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.806
We'd get carded.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.540
We can just stop by, and watch
the strippers coming in and out, right?

03:58.671 --> 04:00.263
What's going on?

04:02.675 --> 04:05.007
Truckload the other night
from Port Elizabeth?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.672
Give the washing machines
to Frank Contino.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.146
You got it.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.281
Vacuum cleaners, too?

04:13.886 --> 04:16.353
No, Patsy's got a buyer for those.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.785
You been drinking?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.925
Me and Ade had some wine at the house.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.492
Been wanting to talk to you.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.529
Yeah, been wanting to talk to you, too.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.900
I'll go first.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.072
I gotta make it my number-one priority...

04:36.276 --> 04:40.508
to limit my exposure to potentially
damaging conversations and wiretaps.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.810
Sure, guy in your position...

04:45.451 --> 04:49.888
So, over the next couple of years,
more and more...

04:49.956 --> 04:52.754
I'm gonna be giving my orders
through you...

04:52.959 --> 04:55.655
and then finally, only through you.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.058
What about Sil?
You got that with him and Paulie.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.465
Those other guys, Sil, Paulie...

05:04.804 --> 05:06.795
one thing they're not...

05:08.107 --> 05:09.904
they're not my blood.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.608
You hear what I'm saying to you?
It's a matter of trust.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.677
It's very wise.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.081
<i>Sil's a good consiglieri,
and will continue as such.</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:21.848
But he's no fucking spring chicken either.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.923
But it's no reason
to be giving him an attitude.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.653
No, of course not.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.397
And there's gonna be a period of transition.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.657
Jesus Christ, T!

05:33.733 --> 05:37.032
You're gonna take this family
into the 21st century.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.170
We're already in the 21st century, though.

05:41.941 --> 05:45.468
Whatever you say, T.
I'd follow you into the gates of hell.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.407
That's what I was gonna say to you.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.779
What you did for me,
that fuck who killed my father...

05:51.317 --> 05:53.251
I'll never forget that.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.853
I only hope I'm worthy.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.949
- Why wouldn't you be worthy?
- I'm just saying.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.368
Yeah, this looks familiar.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.300
The pizza parlor. Pull over, Matt.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.911
This is it?

06:21.314 --> 06:24.078
- It's closed.
- Shit.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.978
This place, this is the pork store.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.810
It's a gay strip club?

06:28.888 --> 06:31.948
Obviously it's not a strip club,
it's a fucking butcher shop.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.322
I think I got it all messed up.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.927
This is where my dad's office is.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.061
Okay, it's a front.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.664
- Like Genco Olive Oil.
- Yeah, it's like Genco.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.829
- It looks really clandestine.
- So where's the strip club, A.J.?

06:45.905 --> 06:50.171
Maybe Route 17, or Route 4.
Lodi or something?

06:50.376 --> 06:52.367
This is stupid. Let's go.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.751
I heard a car.
Your son's out past curfew again.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.287
- Call his cell?
- My goodness.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.558
I didn't know anybody else was here.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.887
I just use the men's room.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.646
Sometimes I worry about Furio.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.820
Doesn't he seem lonely?

07:38.024 --> 07:40.322
I was telling Jessica
about him this morning...

07:40.393 --> 07:42.861
the hygienist in Dr. Mascera's office?

07:42.929 --> 07:45.329
I know I shouldn't gossip, but...

07:45.598 --> 07:48.624
I think she was having an affair
with Dr. Mascera.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.335
Here she is.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.070
- Their office Christmas card.
- Yeah, there's his hand on her ass.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.131
Stop it.

07:57.710 --> 08:00.008
I think she's ready for somebody nice.

08:00.179 --> 08:03.478
And she seemed very receptive
when I described Furio to her.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.073
She's not his type.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.343
What's his type?

08:09.222 --> 08:12.123
Don't worry about him. Stay out of it.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.916
- One date won't hurt.
- Why do you wanna bother?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.859
<i>My little Helo, Doly!</i>

08:20.466 --> 08:22.195
Speaking of gossip.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.095
That noise in the Mercedes?

08:26.639 --> 08:27.628
Yeah?

08:28.207 --> 08:30.801
Brought it over to Globe Motors
to have it looked at.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.244
And I was talking to Jerry
in the service department?

08:34.413 --> 08:36.847
Now, remember that nice sales lady?

08:38.918 --> 08:40.544
I don't think so.

08:40.886 --> 08:44.049
Gloria Trillo,
she gave me a ride home that day?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.787
You know what Jerry told me about her?
She died.

08:51.664 --> 08:52.653
She what?

08:53.165 --> 08:55.895
She committed suicide. Isn't that awful?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.066
Mr. Empathy over there.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.742
She hung herself from a chandelier.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.548
Good evening, Vesuvio.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.815
I'm sorry, we aren't taking any more
reservations, the kitchen is closing.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.750
$50,000. That's a lotta escarole.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.425
- Did you try the bank?
- Escarole?

09:22.828 --> 09:24.318
Escarole. Money.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.165
Escarole. Money. Good.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.501
No, the bank, red tape.
I have only until the end of the week.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.635
I told my brother
you know people who lend money.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.302
Little pitchers have big ears.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.844
<i>I just need it for 10 days and then,
pas de problème.</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:46.646
- Do you mind if I ask what for?
- Some business in France.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.552
A group is purchasing
an Armagnac property.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.819
I got the dossier right here.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.457
Jesus!

09:59.599 --> 10:01.032
Domaine Vézelay.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.762
After Darroze, one of the oldest,
largest producers of Bas-Armagnac...

10:04.837 --> 10:07.431
which is on fire now in France,
and all over Europe.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.269
It's the next vodka.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.773
This is a $10 million worldwide launch.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.712
I got $100,000 into it,
and I need $50,000 more to get...

10:16.782 --> 10:19.876
- the North American distribution rights.
- Armagnac?

10:20.052 --> 10:22.646
I'll bring you a bottle of Vézelay.
Unbelievable.

10:22.722 --> 10:26.681
- And with cigars, which are now very hot.
- You only need the money for 10 days?

10:26.759 --> 10:27.783
How's that?

10:27.860 --> 10:31.489
Because when the deal is done,
the advertising money is released to me.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.561
You understand,
these people that I might know...

10:35.134 --> 10:36.624
they don't know you.

10:37.169 --> 10:41.538
So I wouldn't be just vouching for you.
I, in essence, would be the lender.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.837
And it's gonna cost you.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.503
- How much?
- $10,000.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.569
<i>Merde.</i>

10:49.949 --> 10:50.938
$5,000.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.444
$7,500.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.577
Okay.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.591
Charmaine, I don't think you know
Elodi's brother, Jean-Philippe?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.392
Nice to meet you, but, Elodi, please...

11:06.198 --> 11:08.393
can you clear off table four?

11:09.869 --> 11:10.961
Thank you.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.738
- Charmaine, she's French?
- Not remotely.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.111
She's a hostess.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.843
Not a busboy.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.884
What was... about, Arthur?

11:32.224 --> 11:34.590
It's just a venture capital thing
with Jean-Philippe.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.823
It wouldn't pass your high
Wharton School of Business standards.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.455
If you wanna bring in money...

11:39.532 --> 11:42.660
why don't you get your friend,
Anthony Soprano, to pay his tab?

11:42.735 --> 11:47.195
- It's close to $6,000.
- I could have an empire like Bobby Flay.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.567
And it still
wouldn't be good enough for you.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.741
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.112
We'll start working on your empire
right after we pay the $10,000...

11:57.183 --> 12:00.277
of orthodenture
Melissa's gonna need this year.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.585
They're on allocation from the factory.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.986
I don't know
when we're going to get any more in.

12:38.057 --> 12:41.049
But I'm free if you wanna take it for a spin.

12:43.229 --> 12:46.858
Actually, I was working with
one of your other salespeople last year.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.595
She was really very helpful,
I ought to give her the business.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.064
Gloria Trillo?

12:52.138 --> 12:54.800
She's no longer with us.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.735
You know where she went?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.003
Actually, she died.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.236
What happened?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.317
She committed suicide.

13:08.687 --> 13:09.676
Why?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.479
I mean...

13:13.526 --> 13:14.891
she was...

13:15.261 --> 13:17.695
Salesperson of the Year, or something.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.822
I didn't know her that well.

13:19.899 --> 13:24.199
But I got the impression she wasn't
very lucky with men, that sort of thing.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.799
- When was this?
- Month ago, maybe two.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.632
What'd she say?

13:30.776 --> 13:33.574
I mean, you know, in the papers you read...

13:34.480 --> 13:36.471
they always leave a note.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.216
She did leave a note on her desk.
The police took it.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.621
Later, they told us it was just copy
for a classified ad.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.988
She was selling her wolf stole.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.721
Anyway, let me give you my card.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.635
Chef Osso Bucco.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.343
This is a rare pleasure.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.746
Or is it medium-well?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.410
A little restaurant humor.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.210
So, you know...

14:16.755 --> 14:21.692
if you brought a pair of dirty chef whites,
my friend here'll suck out the stains for you.

14:23.629 --> 14:24.618
Sit.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.130
Okay, in a nutshell.

14:36.775 --> 14:39.141
- I'd like to borrow a little money.
- How little?

14:39.211 --> 14:41.771
$50,000, just for a couple of weeks.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.878
- I'm upgrading the kitchen in the restaurant.
- Get the fuck outta here.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.816
What you take out of that bar...

14:47.887 --> 14:50.981
you must be sitting on money
like King Croesus.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.056
I wish.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.959
I won't be able to lend you
money for less than two points.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.998
- It's not a problem.
- Just outta curiosity...

15:01.300 --> 15:03.291
what's going to happen in two weeks?

15:04.803 --> 15:07.203
The insurance check's gonna come.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.537
I hate to do it, Artie...

15:17.416 --> 15:20.044
but I think I'm gonna pass. Sorry.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.550
- Why not?
- 'Cause if you don't pay me back...

15:24.089 --> 15:26.489
I ain't gonna be able to hurt you.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.993
So how you doing?

15:36.735 --> 15:38.828
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.029
How about you?

15:43.575 --> 15:45.202
Fine, thank you.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.433
Really?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.878
Business okay? Everybody hunky-dory?

15:51.016 --> 15:52.381
You know...

15:53.152 --> 15:54.619
onward and upward.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.123
How's Gloria Trillo?
She still hanging around?

16:01.093 --> 16:04.187
- It's a terrible tragedy.
- So you fucking knew.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.757
You fucking lied!
You let me fucking sit there!

16:09.201 --> 16:10.293
Please, sit down.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.429
How the fuck am I supposed to trust you?
You're my doctor.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.939
Please, sit down. You're scaring me.

16:17.343 --> 16:21.006
- You've been drinking.
- Why the fuck didn't you help her?

16:21.413 --> 16:25.042
- Sometimes you can't.
- I bet you charged her enough, didn't you?

16:25.117 --> 16:28.052
Bet you didn't cut her a deal,
'cause you're an incompetent.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.749
I give my patients everything I've got.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.349
And when something like this happens,
I'm devastated.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.657
She was a good kid.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.127
But she was fucking crazy, and I told you.

17:17.435 --> 17:21.736
And I want you to know that I was
up-front with her. She knew I was married.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.069
I'm aware of that.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.906
Suicide, Jesus Christ! What the fuck?

17:27.079 --> 17:31.175
I have to respect confidentiality,
even after a patient is dead.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.382
But with something like this...

17:34.820 --> 17:36.754
there's no one cause.

17:38.524 --> 17:42.392
You yourself just referred
to her emotional problems.

17:43.162 --> 17:46.427
She slipped through everyone's grasp.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.660
She did it after me, I mean, admit it.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.795
You know, she...

17:55.407 --> 17:57.967
reached out to me, for me to care...

17:59.278 --> 18:00.745
and I wasn't there for her.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.748
Why are you so quick to blame yourself?

18:15.894 --> 18:16.883
Come in.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.530
- What's up? You want coffee?
- No.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.471
Artie, you need a favor.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.307
- Why didn't you reach out to me?
- What are you talking about?

18:34.379 --> 18:38.110
Ralph Cifaretto called me and told me
you came to him for money?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.681
You need something,
you don't come to me?

18:42.387 --> 18:44.378
- I'm your friend.
- Right.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.253
I didn't want to impinge on our friendship.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.760
But, Artie, this is me...

18:50.429 --> 18:51.919
Tony.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.393
If I was desperate, if Melissa had
a tumor instead of an overbite...

18:56.468 --> 18:58.561
<i>Madonna santo, knock wood...</i>

18:58.704 --> 19:02.800
you'd be the first place I went to,
but this was a business venture.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.243
- What kind of deal?
- Elodi's brother.

19:06.745 --> 19:10.738
Needs a bridge loan, $50,000,
and I get back $57,500 in 10 days.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.979
- Thought it was for the restaurant.
- I told Ralphie that.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.953
Don't want him going around me
to the principals.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.183
- What for then?
- North American distribution rights...

19:20.259 --> 19:24.025
for Domaine Vézelay Armagnac.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.439
It's the new vodka.
This stuff is sweeping Europe.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.375
It's gonna be bigger than Stoli, Goose.
Who ever heard of Goose before?

19:39.444 --> 19:41.105
It's French vodka.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.075
These guys, they're big players.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.318
They're throwing millions
behind product introduction.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.048
- All right, you got it.
- I told you, Tony, no.

19:50.255 --> 19:53.053
What the fuck am I?
A toxic person or something?

19:53.125 --> 19:55.320
No, Tony, come on, please.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.259
I'll charge you a point and a half.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.856
And that's a lot fucking
better than Ralph Cifaretto would do.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.199
I insist.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.035
Look here's, like, $3,000.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.833
Somebody's gonna come by,
give you the rest.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.911
You're a great guy.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.082
Come here.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.360
It's a good idea.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.525
Snifter, a nice cigar. You'll see what I mean.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.470
Dinner's almost ready.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.144
Shit.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.334
Which do you wanna see?

22:18.036 --> 22:19.025
This...

22:20.339 --> 22:21.328
or this?

22:46.565 --> 22:48.692
Cousin Brian's here!

23:01.012 --> 23:02.502
Be right down!

23:05.650 --> 23:08.949
- Brian, how you doing?
- Good, Ton', great to see you.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.855
Brian brought the papers.

23:12.924 --> 23:15.620
He said you called him last night
to hurry things along?

23:15.694 --> 23:18.822
Yeah, the Soprano family living trust,
as discussed.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.365
Now when I croak, it's her problem.

23:23.135 --> 23:26.195
You have made me so happy.

23:28.206 --> 23:31.369
And if I was, like, obnoxious about this,
I'm sorry.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.641
Come on.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.415
That's my lava cookies for the bake sale.

23:38.483 --> 23:42.579
- Would you like a couple for your coffee?
- Thanks, but I gotta get back.

23:42.654 --> 23:45.316
We'll see you and Janelle at the
Billy Joel thing, right?

23:45.390 --> 23:46.857
Wouldn't miss it.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.461
You know what, Ton'?
It's a shame you didn't get eight tickets.

23:52.531 --> 23:56.524
Furio and Jessica could have come.
It takes the pressure off of a blind date.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.728
Heshie's guy could only get six.

24:04.176 --> 24:08.840
I'll get the originals back to you.
I'll have a copy, get one to your lawyer.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.505
All right.

24:18.623 --> 24:22.787
You know, that's a nice suit. What is it?

24:22.861 --> 24:23.987
Boss.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.691
- Yeah, I notice you like the good stuff.
- My only vice.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.465
Call this number.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.731
You ask for Patsy.

24:34.005 --> 24:37.202
- Tell him I said to take care of you.
- Thanks, Tony.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.243
- You're a great guy.
- All right.

25:14.145 --> 25:17.444
- Don't forget to call on that meat order.
- No problem.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.056
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:04.963 --> 26:08.797
- Hi, Ma. This is Devin.
- Hi, Devin, how are you?

26:08.867 --> 26:11.597
- Really well. It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.901
- Anthony, you want to turn that down?
- Yeah.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.306
If you kids are hungry,
I can make a couple sandwiches.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.177
No, we're fine, Ma.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.080
Careful of my Lladró, please.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.582
Yeah. Don't worry.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.521
- What do you call it?
- Lladró.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.556
I don't even wanna say how much it costs.

26:39.631 --> 26:40.825
$3,000.

26:44.469 --> 26:47.063
I really wanted to be alone with you.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.335
Your house is out, right?

26:50.342 --> 26:55.041
My mom's boyfriend's using it as an office,
and I'm not at my dad's till next week.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.811
- My sister's dorm.
- At Columbia?

27:01.786 --> 27:03.310
Sure, let's go.

27:04.923 --> 27:07.483
The 33 bus goes into the city every hour.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.494
They're so smelly. I'll call a car service.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.863
- How much is that?
- I'll put it on my AmEx.

27:14.599 --> 27:16.362
I'll call her cell.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.668
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

27:24.743 --> 27:29.043
I'm on my way into the city with a friend,
and I thought maybe we could hook up?

27:29.114 --> 27:32.948
Wow, great.
I'm not on campus, but you could meet me.

27:33.018 --> 27:37.079
<i>Take the Cross Bronx Expressway
to the corner of Brook Ave. And 161st Street.</i>

27:37.155 --> 27:40.386
- Brook Avenue and what?
- 161st Street.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.688
- Okay.
- All right, see you soon.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.056
I pictured your house different.

27:48.133 --> 27:52.900
I thought it'd be like Don Corleone's
compound with gate, wall, big old Cadillacs.

27:53.805 --> 27:54.999
Isn't that stupid?

27:55.073 --> 27:57.837
Our place in Tahoe
looks exactly like Michael's in l.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.500
Wow, really?

27:59.878 --> 28:02.745
No, we don't have a place in Tahoe.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.482
We have a boat though.

28:05.550 --> 28:08.144
I'm like a gangster dude's girlfriend.

28:21.933 --> 28:26.029
- Are you sure this is it?
- Brook Avenue and 161st Street.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.999
- Columbia? This looks like Harlem.
- South Bronx.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.278
Don't leave, okay?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.198
Help you?

28:58.703 --> 29:00.193
They're mine.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.406
When did you get taller than me?

29:04.743 --> 29:08.440
Cheokay, this is my little brother.
Cheokay just got accepted at Yale Law.

29:08.513 --> 29:10.174
What's happening?

29:11.649 --> 29:15.380
- I'm Meadow, Politeness Man's sister.
- I'm Devin.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.114
Can I talk to you?

29:19.691 --> 29:21.784
This is what you do on a Friday night?

29:21.860 --> 29:23.828
The South Bronx Law Center.

29:23.895 --> 29:27.797
It's a free criminal defense service
for those who can't afford legal counsel.

29:27.866 --> 29:28.924
I intern here.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.491
- I need to use your room.
- What for?

29:33.438 --> 29:34.735
You know.

29:38.409 --> 29:41.378
You've gotta be kidding. Anthony, no.

29:41.446 --> 29:45.143
- Well, just for a little while. Why not?
- I don't even wanna think about it.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.480
It's my bed.
How am I gonna go in there after?

29:47.552 --> 29:51.215
We'll just stay on the coverlet.
We came all the way over here.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.020
I thought you wanted to go into the city.
There's all this stuff going on.

29:55.093 --> 29:57.561
I thought we'd go to the Alphabets.
A friend's reading.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.256
She's a novelist.

30:05.436 --> 30:09.964
The greatest cultural center in the world,
and you came over here for sex?

30:12.010 --> 30:13.671
Probably just gonna cruise.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.612
Is the tree up at Rockefeller Center yet?

30:18.716 --> 30:21.276
Look at the way these people have to live.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.015
I think they're overwhelmed.

30:26.357 --> 30:29.690
I mean, they're in a cycle,
they keep having kids...

30:30.995 --> 30:32.223
I know.

30:32.797 --> 30:37.598
We're just so insulated from reality.
I mean, we have everything we want.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.663
When you think about it.

30:39.737 --> 30:42.365
They're on food stamps and welfare.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.773
And my mom could go out
and buy a statue for $3,000.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.739
It's $3,000.

30:47.812 --> 30:51.111
- We have a housekeeper three days a week.
- We have one, too.

30:52.217 --> 30:56.813
I guess I just lucked out to be rich
and live in a big house.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.555
Even somebody like Steve Mussel.

31:00.625 --> 31:04.425
He's got all right clothes,
but have you ever been to his house?

31:04.495 --> 31:06.122
I don't think so.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.222
His dad's a math teacher.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.693
They don't even have a dining room.

31:10.969 --> 31:14.564
There's five people living there.
It's just this little box.

31:19.677 --> 31:20.803
Here.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.510
Arthur, already 80 seats tonight.

31:24.582 --> 31:26.413
They come to see you.

31:31.189 --> 31:34.590
I eat so much of your gnocchi,
I'm gonna get a belly.

31:41.966 --> 31:45.026
Elodi, is Jean-Philippe okay?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.630
- What do you mean?
- He was gonna call me.

31:48.706 --> 31:51.300
I left him a couple of messages,
he didn't call back.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.311
Did you hear from him?
Does he call your mother?

31:54.512 --> 31:58.448
He always works strange hours.
The time difference.

31:59.183 --> 32:00.878
By the time we're waking up...

32:00.952 --> 32:04.251
they're already at home,
eating dinner in Toulouse.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.117
I almost forget.

32:09.527 --> 32:13.429
<i>I bring you something.
Boulevard des Slows. It's for the PA.</i>

32:16.401 --> 32:19.131
I have to put the flowers in the vases.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.436
Problems with the investment, Arthur?

32:23.508 --> 32:24.770
What do you mean?

32:25.009 --> 32:27.068
Please. What do you think?

32:27.312 --> 32:30.975
<i>She suddenly wants to play
"hide the boudin blanc" with you?</i>

32:38.289 --> 32:40.553
We don't see you here anymore.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.421
Or up at the house, either.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.124
Christopher, he can't seem to shake this flu.

32:48.199 --> 32:51.225
Yeah, I noticed his skin
doesn't look so good.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.070
He's just stressed out.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.333
Which reminds me.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.274
Billy Joel?
Maybe you shouldn't count on us.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.869
You mean, you might not be able to come?

33:01.946 --> 33:06.246
There's been all these problems
at the Crazy Horse, and I don't know...

33:07.719 --> 33:10.153
What a shame, that's awful.

33:11.189 --> 33:14.056
What am I gonna do with those tickets?

33:26.137 --> 33:28.230
God, I love marrow.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.973
Remember Ma with the bone?

33:32.043 --> 33:34.773
Sounded like half-price day
at the liposuction center.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.074
Please.

33:36.948 --> 33:40.679
It's nice, us having dinner together,
catching up.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.084
I'm just glad I'm in a position to do it.

33:49.594 --> 33:53.963
Chocolate soufflé, gelato, sorbet sampler.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.027
- On the house.
- Thank you.

33:57.101 --> 34:00.298
Something for after dinner,
I got a nice Armagnac.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.238
I used to drink that in France. Histamines.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.335
I think it's good.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.806
I know, Tony. Can I have a Nonino Picolit?

34:08.880 --> 34:12.077
- I know it's expensive.
- Yeah, bring me one, too.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.213
So you and Bobby Bacala, huh?

34:18.289 --> 34:19.255
So that's it.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.987
What is so fucking compelling to you
about my personal business?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.755
Jesus Christ, am I such an ogre?

34:24.829 --> 34:28.196
I was just gonna say he's a nice guy.

34:28.466 --> 34:29.831
I gotta have an agenda?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.159
No, Tony.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.873
- I'm sorry.
- What am I, a toxic person?

34:35.940 --> 34:37.840
You're a great brother.

34:38.609 --> 34:41.134
We can go at it pretty good...

34:41.679 --> 34:44.806
but you always seem to reach out
when it counts.

34:45.616 --> 34:46.742
Yeah?

34:50.655 --> 34:53.418
Did you ever know anybody that...

34:55.760 --> 34:57.660
ever committed suicide?

34:58.463 --> 35:01.227
Plenty. I used to live in Seattle, Tony.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.463
Anybody close?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.096
Murray Furlong.

35:07.505 --> 35:10.997
He was a good friend. He lived upstairs.

35:11.242 --> 35:15.042
People said he was in the CIA,
gone for long periods of time and...

35:15.113 --> 35:17.604
I always thought he was gay. I don't know.

35:17.682 --> 35:20.674
Maybe that's not mutually exclusive.
Anyway...

35:21.486 --> 35:22.851
one day...

35:25.756 --> 35:28.384
he sucked on the end of a deer rifle.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.751
Do you feel responsible?

35:35.032 --> 35:36.431
Yeah, I did.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.559
You know, partly, we all did.

35:40.271 --> 35:44.002
My last conversation with him
was an argument...

35:44.509 --> 35:49.446
if you can call it that, about him asking me
to accept FedEx packages for him.

35:53.818 --> 35:57.481
- But you never really know why.
- Probably it was his name.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.022
You can leave the bottle.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.698
And, Artie, put that on my tab.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.103
Of course.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.582
Tony, can I talk to you?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.982
What's going on?

36:34.058 --> 36:36.549
I just wanna give you a little heads up.

36:36.627 --> 36:39.255
I know the money's due in a couple of days.

36:40.298 --> 36:41.663
I'm a little concerned.

36:41.732 --> 36:45.361
I can't get a hold of Jean-Philippe,
he doesn't return my calls.

36:48.339 --> 36:51.331
- Did you go over there?
- Not yet.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.386
Artie, you gotta go over there.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.856
- The guy's not returning your phone calls.
- I know.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.755
They miss a payment, start acting like...

37:11.829 --> 37:14.491
they're doing you a favor
if they give you anything.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.830
And then you gotta spend
all your time hounding 'em.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.268
You gotta get your arms around this thing.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.374
You know what I'm saying?

37:37.288 --> 37:40.280
Jean-Philippe, you're home.

37:40.591 --> 37:44.220
<i>I called you five times, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Message machine broken?</i>

37:44.295 --> 37:45.626
Nice crib.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.823
What is that, Berber carpet?

37:48.733 --> 37:51.964
Those fucking shoes you wear...

37:52.036 --> 37:54.937
what are they, designer?

37:56.907 --> 37:59.569
You fucking avoiding me, motherfucker?

37:59.644 --> 38:03.080
Where's my money?
What, are you gonna cry now?

38:03.547 --> 38:08.314
<i>Stand up, you frog-eating faccia di cazz',
I will fuck you up, man.</i>

39:20.157 --> 39:22.751
It's you. Hello. Come in.

39:22.827 --> 39:27.730
<i>You're home. Qu'est-ce que c'est, man?
Message machine broken?</i>

39:28.933 --> 39:31.731
I'm sorry, I've been wishing to call you.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.267
Nice crib.

39:33.337 --> 39:35.862
You were supposed to give me my money
two days ago.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.066
I know.

39:37.141 --> 39:41.771
Crédit Lyonnais, they didn't come through
with the second round of financing yet.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.871
My partners are sick about it.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.473
That's not my problem, Jean-Philippe.

39:47.818 --> 39:51.117
- I want my money.
- I just told you, I don't have it.

39:52.490 --> 39:56.688
- When are you gonna get it?
- I don't know, okay? I don't know.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.052
It doesn't look too good.

40:00.431 --> 40:02.194
What does that mean?

40:02.800 --> 40:06.497
I mean, I don't know
if it's going to happen, all right?

40:07.304 --> 40:10.273
They were not convinced
to our business model.

40:10.341 --> 40:14.107
They didn't agree there was
as much potential for Armagnac.

40:14.645 --> 40:18.581
The problem has been, it seems,
that people cannot figure out...

40:18.649 --> 40:20.776
how to market Armagnac.

40:21.018 --> 40:24.647
The hip approach, like with Stoli, fails.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.784
You said it was the next vodka!

40:26.857 --> 40:29.417
Hey, so we are big boys, we must move on.

40:29.794 --> 40:33.195
<i>Frog-eating, fucking faccia di cazz'.</i>

40:33.264 --> 40:35.824
- What did you say?
- I said, I want my money!

40:35.900 --> 40:38.391
Are you stupid? That money's spent.

40:38.702 --> 40:41.000
<i>Operating expenses, notaires, travel.</i>

40:41.071 --> 40:42.129
No!

40:42.373 --> 40:46.571
- You have my $50,000.
- It's business, it's a risk.

40:46.644 --> 40:50.944
- I have a daughter who needs braces!
- Listen to me, I don't have it right now.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.974
You fucking, French, fucking,
lying cocksucker!

40:58.255 --> 41:00.018
Fuck your mother!

41:15.439 --> 41:16.838
My earring!

41:18.042 --> 41:20.340
<i>- You ripped my fucking ear!
- Du con.</i>

41:24.281 --> 41:26.909
- I want my money.
- Fuck you!

41:26.984 --> 41:29.248
I see you again, I'll kill you.

41:36.861 --> 41:40.228
The thing is to keep knocking on the door
without going in right away.

41:40.297 --> 41:44.563
Poke the perimeter, tap on the gate
till she's out of her fucking mind, begging.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.399
Then you own that shit, that pussy's yours.

41:47.471 --> 41:49.268
I think she's ready.

41:49.707 --> 41:51.641
We shall know forsooth.

41:53.077 --> 41:55.568
Liz has been to her house.
She says it's nice.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.249
<i>lt doesn't look that great.</i>

42:00.317 --> 42:02.046
<i>lt's kind of Bo Peep-ish.</i>

42:05.022 --> 42:06.580
<i>Can l help you?</i>

42:09.059 --> 42:10.924
We're here to see Devin Pillsbury.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.657
<i>Proceed on up, park in the auto court.</i>

42:28.379 --> 42:29.869
Help you guys?

42:29.947 --> 42:31.972
It's okay, Ted. Hi, guys.

42:32.783 --> 42:35.513
You wanna pull it over here for me, sir?

42:44.028 --> 42:47.191
Wow, nice place.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.631
Get outta here.

43:23.701 --> 43:26.670
No, it's true. Iceland is a volcano.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.500
Hawaii is a volcano.

43:35.245 --> 43:36.610
Come here.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.177
Hello?

43:43.354 --> 43:46.016
I just want you to know that I tried.

43:46.090 --> 43:48.422
<i>And l didn't mean to hurt anybody.</i>

43:48.959 --> 43:53.157
And I love you, and I'm sorry I let you down.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.492
Artie?

43:57.134 --> 43:59.432
What's the matter? What's wrong with you?

43:59.503 --> 44:02.597
I'm a complete and total failure.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.604
You take care of Charmaine.

44:07.678 --> 44:09.339
What did you do, Artie?

44:09.947 --> 44:11.346
What did you do?

44:11.415 --> 44:12.939
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

44:13.017 --> 44:15.281
Artie, did you take something?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.120
Don't go to sleep!

44:17.187 --> 44:19.485
<i>Artie, you hear me? Don't go to sleep!</i>

44:22.226 --> 44:23.921
Jesus fucking Christ!

44:23.994 --> 44:26.087
What's wrong? You gotta go?

44:26.397 --> 44:27.762
A friend of mine.

44:28.032 --> 44:32.435
Fucking idiot took some pills or something,
he's trying to kill himself.

44:33.737 --> 44:35.728
What the fuck am I doing?

44:39.677 --> 44:43.913
I'm gonna call 911.
They'll do him more good than I can.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.182
- Are these real?
- Yeah.

44:53.791 --> 44:56.191
So this is, like, a real Picasso?

44:56.260 --> 44:58.194
My dad collects his later stuff.

44:59.897 --> 45:01.592
They're all cocks.

45:01.665 --> 45:03.530
Picasso was an old man by then.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.194
Shit, they must be worth millions, at least.

45:06.270 --> 45:08.500
Isn't your dad afraid
we're gonna steal them?

45:13.977 --> 45:15.672
What is that, a Sota turntable?

45:15.946 --> 45:17.937
Whoa, Patrick, little Mr. Consumer.

45:21.819 --> 45:24.413
You don't like that?
Do you want something else?

45:24.488 --> 45:25.682
No, just...

45:26.757 --> 45:28.622
I wish you would've said something.

45:29.426 --> 45:31.417
It doesn't mean anything.

45:31.829 --> 45:35.629
I feel so stupid. My mother's stupid Lladró...

45:35.833 --> 45:38.267
and we have a housekeeper
three days a week?

45:38.335 --> 45:41.566
I don't care. I like you.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.100
<i>Rubber Soul in mint condition.
This has gotta be worth, what?</i>

45:47.811 --> 45:51.076
- You should've told me.
- And what would you have done if I did?

45:51.148 --> 45:55.812
I don't know, but if it wasn't such a big deal,
why didn't you say something?

46:06.163 --> 46:07.391
Jesus.

46:08.132 --> 46:09.429
What happened?

46:10.367 --> 46:13.700
It all went to shit. "The next vodka. "

46:14.238 --> 46:16.001
So this is what you do?

46:16.073 --> 46:19.770
But you don't understand.
The money's gone.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.908
Can't you come and talk to me?

46:26.250 --> 46:27.478
I'm your friend.

46:29.186 --> 46:33.350
Suppose you hadn't been able to reach me,
and I go to your house and find you dead.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.781
How am I supposed to feel?

46:41.064 --> 46:42.861
Take the restaurant.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.793
I don't want the fucking restaurant.

46:50.207 --> 46:52.641
Then how am I gonna pay you back?

46:53.076 --> 46:57.103
$50,000, it'd take the rest of my life.

46:57.181 --> 47:00.014
It's $51,500, vig-wise, Artie...

47:00.484 --> 47:03.510
and technically,
you already missed a payment.

47:08.058 --> 47:10.288
All right, look, let's just...

47:10.828 --> 47:13.353
We'll wipe my tab at the restaurant.

47:13.597 --> 47:14.928
Thank you.

47:20.370 --> 47:23.430
Tony, that's what, $6,000?

47:24.208 --> 47:26.005
What about the rest of the money?

47:26.376 --> 47:28.173
I'll assume the guy's dead.

47:28.245 --> 47:31.237
- Collect the $50,000.
- Thank you.

47:43.560 --> 47:46.393
The cobwebs are now removed.

47:46.897 --> 47:48.797
What the fuck are you talking about?

47:48.866 --> 47:50.993
You saw this whole thing, didn't you?

47:51.068 --> 47:54.469
You knew exactly what was gonna happen.

47:57.975 --> 48:00.637
You can see 20 moves down the road.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.373
Please, I don't blame you, I envy you.

48:03.914 --> 48:06.678
It's like an instinct,
like a hawk sees a little mouse...

48:06.750 --> 48:08.945
moving around a cornfield, from a mile up.

48:09.019 --> 48:11.715
You think it's my fault
you're fucking lying in here?

48:11.788 --> 48:15.280
It's just that somebody mentions $50,000...

48:15.359 --> 48:18.351
<i>to bankroll a French digestif,
and your mind...</i>

48:18.562 --> 48:22.760
goes through all the permutations at,
like, internet speed and realizes:

48:23.033 --> 48:26.264
"Worst case scenario: I eat for free. "

48:29.973 --> 48:31.804
You fucking suicide!

48:31.875 --> 48:34.537
- You're disgraceful!
- I'm sorry.

48:34.978 --> 48:36.536
No, fuck that!

48:41.451 --> 48:43.578
Does anybody else know
I loaned you the money?

48:43.654 --> 48:45.451
- Like who?
- I don't give a fuck who.

48:45.522 --> 48:48.821
Adriana, Father Intintola, my wife, anybody?

48:52.629 --> 48:54.597
All right, you got mugged.

48:54.765 --> 48:57.859
Outside of your house,
it was a street crime, kids.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.597
They took your wallet and your watch.
Where are they?

49:00.671 --> 49:02.195
- Why?
- Come on.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.336
Why?

49:10.113 --> 49:12.547
You don't care what people think?

49:12.983 --> 49:15.451
I do! Enough people hate me.

49:17.287 --> 49:20.256
You fought back,
they ripped your earring outta your ear...

49:20.324 --> 49:23.816
you were bleeding, went inside the house,
you took pills for the pain...

49:23.894 --> 49:27.193
'cause you'd have to wait
at the emergency room for a couple hours.

49:28.765 --> 49:32.462
They pumped my stomach.
They saw the Armagnac.

49:32.536 --> 49:34.333
You got fucking mugged!

49:34.404 --> 49:37.202
Do you understand me?
I didn't loan you shit.

50:08.739 --> 50:10.434
I had this dream.

50:10.507 --> 50:14.307
My grandfather's sitting at a table,
and in front of him is Steak Pizzaiola.

50:14.378 --> 50:16.573
And standing next to him
is my grandmother.

50:16.646 --> 50:19.911
And she's wearing a blue dress
and pouring him a glass of wine.

50:19.983 --> 50:22.417
And he says to me, "You see this?

50:22.486 --> 50:25.785
"If you got a good wife,
you're a millionaire. "

50:26.089 --> 50:30.389
So the next day, I go over Carmela's house
for dinner with her family.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.156
And in front of me is Steak Pizzaiola.

50:34.464 --> 50:37.194
Before I could realize
the déjà vu that was going on...

50:37.267 --> 50:40.100
Carmela's standing next to me
in a blue dress...

50:40.170 --> 50:42.297
pouring me a glass of soda.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.573
The next day, I bought the ring.

50:48.245 --> 50:51.703
That is so incredible, so romantic.

50:53.917 --> 50:56.215
She's a romantic one, this one.

50:56.286 --> 50:59.016
- She gonna clean my teeth for me.
- Really?

50:59.089 --> 51:02.388
I have to confess. You know, sometimes,
I find the dentist erotic.

51:02.659 --> 51:05.184
Brian, all night, I admire your suit.

51:05.262 --> 51:07.355
My man, Mr. Soprano, turned me on to it.

51:07.431 --> 51:09.524
Nice. Patsy?

51:10.467 --> 51:14.597
- I'd like to propose a toast to our host.
- Hear, hear.

51:16.039 --> 51:20.408
Tony, great tickets, great meal, great wine...

51:20.477 --> 51:24.345
and for being a great guy,
who I'm proud to call a new friend.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.791
So he says I planned it all along...

51:36.860 --> 51:39.886
that I could see 20 steps down the road
how it was gonna go...

51:39.996 --> 51:41.827
and how he was gonna get screwed.

51:41.898 --> 51:43.388
Did you?

51:44.101 --> 51:46.228
- See it?
- I don't know.

51:49.206 --> 51:53.165
According to him,
it's subconscious, second nature.

51:54.311 --> 51:58.179
- But the accusation bothers you.
- Is that the kind of person I am?

51:58.248 --> 52:00.614
A hawk? That's an animal.

52:01.485 --> 52:05.387
As I understand it,
you make a lot of your living through usury.

52:05.755 --> 52:08.952
So why the pangs of conscience this time?

52:10.093 --> 52:14.189
Do you think your reaction
would've been the same, if it all...

52:14.731 --> 52:17.564
your friend taking the pills, all of it...

52:18.635 --> 52:23.129
hadn't happened a week or so after
you found out about Gloria?

52:25.442 --> 52:29.674
