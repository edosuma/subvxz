[Sophie] We broke into the school
at night.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.319
There was this teacher.
We hated him.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.960
We just wanted revenge.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.840
[soft laughter]

01:11.920 --> 01:13.680
[young Sophie] Rachel, Bobby, come on.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.640
[Sophie] We only went there
to mess up the classroom.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.480
Just stupid fun.
But it went too far.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.440
[indistinct cheering]

01:24.520 --> 01:27.520
Bobby took it too far.
It got out of hand.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.480
Burn it.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.480
[gasps]

01:35.480 --> 01:36.880
[all laughing]

01:40.560 --> 01:43.200
- We need to stop it, Rachel.
- How?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.200
Run!

01:52.560 --> 01:53.840
- [young Helen] Oh, shit!
- [young Craig] What?

01:53.920 --> 01:55.320
[young Helen] Look, camera.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.720
[young Archie] Fuck, what do we do?

01:57.400 --> 01:58.280
[young Sophie] There'll be a tape.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.280
[breathing heavily] It's here.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.479
[tape ejects]

02:08.560 --> 02:09.720
[young Helen] Go. Go.

02:14.080 --> 02:14.920
Oh, God.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.960
[shouting] There's kids in the school!

02:17.840 --> 02:21.040
Fire! Get out!

02:21.120 --> 02:23.120
[all coughing]

02:27.480 --> 02:28.560
Where's Craig?

02:29.040 --> 02:30.040
Where's Craig?

02:30.120 --> 02:31.160
Sophie.

02:31.840 --> 02:32.960
Sophie!

02:34.640 --> 02:38.200
Eight children died that night.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
We were just kids ourselves.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.600
And we were scared.
We were so scared.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.320
Rachel wanted to go to the police.
Helen did.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.840
- And you?
- I didn't know what to do.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.960
Rachel lived with this her whole life.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.640
Kept it from me.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.240
We vowed, Tom.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.640
Once we'd got away with it,
once things had moved on,

03:13.720 --> 03:16.680
we vowed never to talk
about it ever again.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.760
[breathes deeply]

03:18.840 --> 03:20.840
Rachel and I spent our lives
trying to be...

03:20.920 --> 03:22.480
We could have run away, but we didn't.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.480
We stayed here and we put something back
into the community with our work.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.760
And Bobby left.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.000
Bobby thought we were mad,
sticking around here.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.760
Watching the parents
of those children that died.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.280
[exhales]

03:43.280 --> 03:44.480
We were kids, Tom.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.320
We were stupid kids
and we made a terrible mistake.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.040
We didn't wanna lie to you.

03:56.760 --> 03:57.920
Rachel...

03:59.800 --> 04:01.200
how could she tell you?

04:01.760 --> 04:03.240
[groans]

04:03.320 --> 04:05.440
[Sophie] How could she tell your girls?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.880
She was trying to protect them.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.680
- How could we tell our children...
- [sighs]

04:10.760 --> 04:12.880
...that we were responsible for that?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.040
Jenny found out.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.680
She must have.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.840
She'd been looking
through Rachel's things,

04:29.920 --> 04:33.680
and Rachel had been trying to
tell us something before she died.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.120
[sighs] Maybe I deserve this.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.760
Karma.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.840
For what?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.040
Oh, just being stupid.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.600
[Tom] Jenny must have known,
started digging around.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.800
She went to Helen and Bobby.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.680
She was going there that night,
with Chris, to Heaven,

05:04.760 --> 05:07.160
the night he got killed.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.280
And now, Helen's dead.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.640
You think Bobby killed them?

05:15.240 --> 05:17.320
- Don't you?
- [scoffs]

05:17.400 --> 05:19.120
So, if he's got Jenny...

05:19.680 --> 05:23.120
- He wouldn't.
- Why not? What's one more?

05:23.200 --> 05:26.200
We have to find him.
You have to help me get to him.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.560
Okay. Just let me think, all right?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.360
[cell phone ringing]

05:39.240 --> 05:40.160
Hello?

05:40.240 --> 05:43.880
Bobby. Hi, it's Sophie.
Sophie Farnbrook?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.880
- I need to see you.
- About what?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.000
About Helen.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.080
I know it was you,
but I can make it go away.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.720
We've got a problem.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.840
She kept the tape,
the CCTV from the school. Now it's...

06:00.920 --> 06:02.720
- No. I've got it.
- What?

06:02.800 --> 06:04.920
Yeah, I've got it. I'll bring it.
Don't worry.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.800
The only problem now is Jenny Delaney.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.920
- Do you know where she is?
- Yeah. She's here.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.160
- Where's "here"?
- My apartment.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.600
Okay, can I come over?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.440
I'll text you the address,
but like you say...

06:22.080 --> 06:23.280
she's a problem.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.120
Don't do anything until I get there, okay?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.720
We need to figure this out together.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.360
Listen to me, Sophie.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.840
If you don't come alone,
and if you're bringing...

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
I'll be alone.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.960
[doorbell rings]

07:41.160 --> 07:42.000
Yes?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.760
Could I talk to you?

07:45.360 --> 07:47.480
- About what?
- My mum.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.280
You were at school together.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.360
[chain unlocking]

08:04.760 --> 08:07.200
[door locking]

08:18.080 --> 08:21.880
[Jenny] I've been
reading Mum's old diaries.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.720
Sort of a way to feel close to her.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.000
She wrote a lot. [chuckles]

08:29.720 --> 08:31.440
I idolized her.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.200
Rachel.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.440
I wanted to be like her.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.480
She was one of those...
boys liked her, girls liked her.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.000
You look just like her.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.600
- A bit.
- A lot.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.760
When she was your age.

09:33.320 --> 09:37.160
Look. There.
You're the spit of her.

09:39.080 --> 09:39.920
[chuckles]

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
There's me.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.920
[Jenny and Helen laugh]

09:46.000 --> 09:48.360
Do you have a photo of Craig?

09:50.720 --> 09:51.880
[Helen] What?

09:52.480 --> 09:56.160
Craig. She talks about him in her diaries.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.640
[Helen] That's him.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.520
Was Mum...

10:09.920 --> 10:12.680
involved in something?

10:14.280 --> 10:18.240
Her diary's kind of cryptic,
but she talks about an incident.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.120
Says she can't live with it.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.000
Remember your mum as you knew her.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.920
Anything before that is her business.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You spoke to her the day she died.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.280
Why did she call you?

10:34.280 --> 10:35.560
To say goodbye.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
She was saying things, after you left.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.160
Things that scared me.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.280
What kind of things?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.440
About people dying.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.160
Her mind was confused.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
Tea?

10:54.880 --> 10:55.920
What's Jasmine?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.640
Leave me alone.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.320
Go home.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.760
Hi, babe, you know you found
your dad's old porn tapes?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.600
Does he still have a VHS player?

11:26.160 --> 11:28.360
[Chris] That's school security footage.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.560
1990. May 17th.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.320
Why would she have this?

11:37.520 --> 11:39.080
[Chris] There must be some reason.

11:41.040 --> 11:41.880
Stop.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.160
That's Helen.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.080
That's my mum.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.560
[Chris] And the others?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.240
She's kept this all these years.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.880
Hidden in her crazy house.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.880
This is evidence.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.120
Evidence?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.000
Of what?

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
[Chris] School was closed,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.680
but there was a sponsored stay-awake
on the night of the fire

12:34.760 --> 12:35.800
in the common room.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.400
Fuck.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
Fuck.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.000
[Jenny] My mum...

12:44.720 --> 12:46.480
and the others...

12:48.760 --> 12:50.040
they set the fire.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.480
But a guy was arrested, wasn't he?
Some drunk.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.280
Ray Barton. Drug addict, vagrant.
Seen near the area.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.680
This makes no sense.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.560
Look, if your mum
and the others did it, if...

13:06.120 --> 13:07.600
It looks like they were never caught.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.040
Wait, hang on. Look at this.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.480
[Jenny] "Craig Pratchett,
16-year-old student,

13:17.560 --> 13:20.800
risked his own life
by entering the burning building

13:20.880 --> 13:22.640
to try to save the younger children.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.320
Critical condition."

13:26.840 --> 13:27.840
Craig.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.840
[Chris] Him?

13:33.560 --> 13:36.080
Okay, third from the end.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.160
"Archie 'Bobby' Roberts."

13:39.880 --> 13:41.960
I think Mum mentions a Bobby in her diary.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.480
[Chris] And then there was one.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.000
It's hard. They're all so blurry.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.320
[Chris] They're the only ones
with hair like that.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.440
[Jenny] Okay, give me both their names.

13:57.520 --> 14:02.760
[Chris] All right, middle row, three in...

14:02.840 --> 14:04.440
- Cassandra Wyatt.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.880
And then, bottom row, second to last,
Sophie Farnbrook.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.040
- Sophie?
- What?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.400
Oh, my God, it is.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.480
Sophie. Henry's mum. The cop.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.800
The bitch that arrested me?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.080
We should talk to her.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.800
And say what?
"Did you and my mum burn down the school?"

14:27.880 --> 14:29.760
- She's a cop.
- Exactly!

14:29.840 --> 14:31.160
She's a fucking hypocrite.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.480
She lectures me for possession
and she's involved in this shit.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.160
- We can't.
- Why not?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.440
Chris, we just can't.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.880
She's seeing my dad.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.720
- They're shagging.
- [sighs]

14:43.160 --> 14:44.000
Okay.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.400
You've already tried Helen,
so let's start with Archie Roberts.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.840
We'll go to Sia's party
for a couple hours,

14:51.920 --> 14:54.520
show our faces.
Then we'll head to the train.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.920
- You think he'll be there?
- He's the owner.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.440
We'll leave him a message if not.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.600
- [Chris] I saw Sophie this morning.
- What?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.600
- I swung by her house.
- Chris!

15:07.680 --> 15:09.680
She needs to know we know.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Did you speak to her?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.760
No, but I will.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.280
- She killed kids.
- Yeah, with my mum.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.880
Your mum wasn't a cop.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.400
- Chris.
- She's a liar.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.360
She's pretending to be
something that she's not.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.560
Look, we are finding this out for me.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.720
Not for revenge or justice.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.800
Because I need to know.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.600
I know.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.240
But she's there, on our doorstep.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.600
She knows the truth.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.760
I don't understand why
you won't let me ask her.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.840
- I...
- I want to ask her.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.640
Where are you going?

15:58.720 --> 16:01.040
Just out with some friends.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.800
- [dance music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

16:03.880 --> 16:05.760
- Have you seen Chris?
- No.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.960
- [Jenny] Have you seen Chris?
- No. Sorry, babe.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.280
Where the fuck are you?

16:31.760 --> 16:32.760
[sighs]

16:55.480 --> 16:57.480
[indistinct chatter]

17:12.560 --> 17:14.560
[dance music playing]

17:31.760 --> 17:32.640
Excuse me.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.880
I'm looking for Bobby, the owner.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.200
Why do you want him?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.680
He's a friend of my mum's.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.760
He's not around.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.520
You want my advice?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.000
Stay away from him.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.480
Will you give him a note?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.120
Hi, this is Jenny.
Leave a message after the beep.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.360
Jen, it's Dad. Where are you?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.680
[doorbell rings]

18:27.800 --> 18:28.920
I know the truth.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.160
About you and Mum.
About the fire.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.960
You're the only other person in the world
to have seen that tape.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.400
I told the others I'd destroyed it,
but I couldn't.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.520
Something made me keep it.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.880
The best I can explain is...

18:50.920 --> 18:52.400
things in the past...

18:54.400 --> 18:56.280
if you push them away long enough,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.480
if you say they never happened, then...

19:01.400 --> 19:02.760
they never happened.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.640
You convince yourself.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.240
But the tape...

19:09.560 --> 19:10.760
that was proof.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.080
That always told me what we'd done...

19:19.480 --> 19:20.560
was real.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.840
[sobbing]

19:21.920 --> 19:23.120
My mum,

19:25.800 --> 19:28.040
it haunted her to the end.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.560
Excuse me.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.560
Have you seen this girl? Sorry...

19:39.640 --> 19:41.400
Round here? Today? Yesterday?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.720
- I don't remember her, no.
- Okay.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.000
You should go home.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.200
I can't.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.600
My dad hates Chris.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.600
He's been bugging my phone.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.160
I don't know how to
tell him about all this.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
My mum.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.120
I can't do it yet.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.400
Helen, hi.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.600
We're asking everyone
when they last saw Jenny Delaney.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.240
Why? Has something happened?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.440
She's been reported missing.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.240
[Helen] Children have so much freedom
these days.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.040
[Emma] Have you seen her
in the last couple of days?

20:34.800 --> 20:35.880
[Helen] No.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.640
I don't know, last week?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.680
[Sophie] That's fine, thank you.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.480
- If you see or hear anything...
- [Helen] Is she in danger?

20:44.520 --> 20:46.760
[Sophie] We found
her boyfriend's body today.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.640
We're obviously very worried about her.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
[Helen] Oh, dear.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.600
[Jenny crying]
I had nothing to do with it. I swear.

21:07.720 --> 21:11.240
He had a fight that night
at the party, but who would do this?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.600
Who would kill him?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.280
Did he know what you knew?

21:19.720 --> 21:20.880
About our secret?

21:31.480 --> 21:33.480
[cell phone ringing]

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
Hello?

21:45.200 --> 21:49.560
[Neil] Zoe, Tilly, and I are deeply moved
by the affection

21:50.720 --> 21:52.520
you have shown Chris.

21:57.800 --> 21:58.640
[Zoe] Hello?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.120
Hello?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.000
- Where is she?
- [Helen] Inside.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.840
She knows the truth.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.800
Rachel's gone. I don't care.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.840
I'm telling you so you can run,
if you wanna run.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.920
It's coming out, Bobby.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.400
I want it to come out.
I want people to know.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.600
There's a woman here.
She's dead.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.520
[Tom] I've been to Bobby's apartment.
I know the layout.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.400
[Sophie] I'll admit to the fire, Tom.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.600
When we get Jenny back,
I'll go and admit the truth.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.040
But whatever happens, promise me
you'll help out with my kids.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.760
If I'm not around.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.960
- Soph...
- Please. Promise me.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.360
You'll help Josh.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.360
I promise.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.960
Thank you.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
[intercom beeps]

24:53.680 --> 24:54.680
[Archie] Come on up.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.600
[door buzzes]

25:24.200 --> 25:26.200
[cell phone vibrating]

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Bobby?

26:00.760 --> 26:01.760
Bobby?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.680
[Archie] Here alone?

26:03.760 --> 26:05.600
[Sophie breathes heavily]

26:06.600 --> 26:09.040
- Yes, of course I'm here alone.
- Where's the tape?

26:09.120 --> 26:10.000
It's safe.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.600
[Sophie] Put the fucking gun down.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.200
Are you out of your mind?

26:15.960 --> 26:17.280
What the fuck are you doing?

26:17.360 --> 26:18.720
Why should I trust you?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.520
I've got as much to lose as you.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.000
More.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.600
Where's Jenny?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
Bedroom.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.480
All right.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.640
Look, she's the only person still alive
that knows the truth.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.880
You think I wanna do this?

26:42.840 --> 26:43.880
But what's the option?

26:43.960 --> 26:45.920
I can't go down, Sophie.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.840
Helen wanted it to come out.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.560
I lost it with her.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.200
[stammering] All right,
she's missing, yeah?

26:57.280 --> 26:59.720
She's been reported missing. Jenny.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.560
Everyone thinks she's run away.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.320
So she doesn't come back.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.600
Because kids disappear
all the time, right?

27:09.080 --> 27:10.960
- So, how?
- Um...

27:12.360 --> 27:14.200
Quick, painless.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.720
She won't even realize it's coming.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.360
Then we get rid of...

27:25.240 --> 27:27.240
[exhaling]

27:28.480 --> 27:31.560
If we're gonna do this, we should do it.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.120
You distract her.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.560
[door unlocks and opens]

27:50.160 --> 27:52.480
Hey. Your dad's worried sick.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.720
[sighs]

27:54.800 --> 27:56.280
So we need to talk.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.640
Can I sit with you for a bit, yeah?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.160
- [sobbing] I want to go home.
- Definitely.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.680
But first, we should talk about
what you discovered.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.280
[Jenny sobbing]

28:40.920 --> 28:41.840
[Sophie] And the fire.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.360
[Jenny] She kept a diary.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.920
And I went to see Helen.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.320
She had the tape, the CCTV.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.800
And that's when me and Chris started...

28:58.320 --> 29:00.120
And then someone killed him.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.560
The school fire was a terrible thing,

29:02.640 --> 29:05.920
and me and your mum and Bobby
never wanted it to get out.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.320
We were so scared.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.320
But that doesn't mean
we haven't paid for it.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.720
Every single one of us.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.720
Having that guilt.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.680
Seeing those families.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.120
It doesn't leave you, Jenny.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
It never leaves.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.720
- No!
- [Archie grunts]

29:25.200 --> 29:26.400
[crying] Dad!

29:27.200 --> 29:28.560
- Dad!
- [Tom grunting]

29:28.640 --> 29:29.560
[Archie and Sophie grunting]

29:35.160 --> 29:36.400
Dad!

29:42.360 --> 29:43.520
[Archie] No!

29:46.760 --> 29:48.920
You fucking lied!

29:49.000 --> 29:49.960
I'm sorry, Bobby.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.360
- I never wanted to kill her.
- I know.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.400
[Archie] You should never have come to me.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.200
What did you hope would happen?

29:57.280 --> 29:58.640
I don't know. I don't know.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.480
No! Bobby, please. Please.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.080
She's Rachel's daughter.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.600
[breathing heavily]

30:18.920 --> 30:20.840
How did we get here?

30:21.880 --> 30:24.600
Nothing stays hidden forever.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.680
The truth always comes out.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.280
[groans]

30:39.680 --> 30:41.280
- [inhales]
- No!

30:41.920 --> 30:43.240
[all gasping]

30:43.320 --> 30:45.120
[Sophie] Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.120
It's okay. You're okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.760
Don't confess.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.720
What?

31:32.200 --> 31:33.560
What good will it do?

31:35.640 --> 31:38.240
I can tell them the truth,
but keep your name out of the fire.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.800
Tell them it was all about Bobby.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.520
- Maybe it's time.
- [Jenny] Why?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.280
Think of Henry, Ellen.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.120
I never wanted you punished.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.840
I've hidden the tape.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.920
I'll say it was destroyed in Helen's fire.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.000
[footsteps approaching]

33:08.040 --> 33:11.680
Bobby then pointed the gun
at Jenny Delaney,

33:11.760 --> 33:13.920
her father, Tom Delaney, then at me.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.840
I had every reason to suspect

33:16.920 --> 33:20.160
that he would use the weapon
against Tom and Jenny Delaney.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.680
The night Chris Chahal died

33:29.760 --> 33:33.000
was the night that you planned
to visit Bobby at Heaven Lounge.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.720
But at this point,

33:36.800 --> 33:40.520
Bobby had no inkling you knew about
his involvement in the school fire.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.080
You'd stolen the tape,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.680
the CCTV tape, from Helen.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.480
Yeah, she might have told him.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.520
[Emma] So, the tape was destroyed
in Helen's fire?

33:58.960 --> 34:03.520
Is it possible Chris contacted Bobby
before you planned to visit him?

34:05.720 --> 34:08.639
He was getting pretty crazy
about the whole thing,

34:09.400 --> 34:11.520
wanting to confront people.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.560
But I don't think so.
We had a plan.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.840
What I'm struggling to understand

34:18.440 --> 34:22.520
is how Bobby, assuming that
he knew about the CCTV tape,

34:22.600 --> 34:25.480
would know you were
at Sia Marshall's party,

34:25.560 --> 34:27.880
and why he would choose
to confront Chris there.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.400
It's such an unlikely place.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.480
Especially if he planned to kill him.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.199
[sobbing]

34:37.280 --> 34:39.880
I should never have got him involved.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.679
If I hadn't dragged him into this,
he'd still be alive.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.800
Okay. I think that's enough for now.
She needs to rest.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.920
I'm sorry. It's too soon.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.120
- We can pick this up tomorrow.
- [Jenny] No, you're right.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.920
It makes no sense.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.960
It doesn't make any sense.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.320
Why would he come to the party?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.880
Can I ask you one last thing?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.880
[sniffles] Mmm-hmm.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.120
Do you recognize this pendant?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.640
It was found at the crime scene.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.880
I changed my mind.

35:40.000 --> 35:40.920
Hey.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.560
You need to confess.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.280
What?

35:44.360 --> 35:46.000
To the murder of Chris Chahal.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.560
Am I right?

35:55.320 --> 35:59.240
No more lies now, Sophie.
Just say the words.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.080
Did you kill Chris Chahal?

36:04.920 --> 36:07.120
They found your pendant at the scene.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.000
It was you, wasn't it?

36:22.840 --> 36:25.120
I didn't mean to.
You know I would never...

36:25.200 --> 36:27.560
Like you didn't mean
to kill those kids in the fire?

36:27.640 --> 36:31.000
- [stammering] What? Let's just back up...
- You killed a boy!

36:31.080 --> 36:34.680
Someone's child.
Zoe's child. You saw her.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.080
It destroyed her.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.200
He was gonna tell everybody.
I had to stop him, but he wouldn't wait.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.000
And he wouldn't listen to me.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.120
- So you killed him?
- No, I didn't mean to.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.000
What if it had been Jenny?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.200
What if she'd confronted you?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.480
Tom, I love you.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.120
[chuckling in disbelief] You...

36:53.200 --> 36:55.520
I didn't want anyone
to find out the truth about me.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.960
I didn't want you to know because
we had a shot at something.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.120
And my kids, how could they know?

37:00.200 --> 37:02.680
Did Jenny really wanna know about Rachel?

37:03.400 --> 37:06.320
No one wants to know that
about their parents.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.920
I was just trying to keep them safe.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.960
I only went to the party
to get Henry.

37:14.040 --> 37:18.440
He'd sneaked out
and I knew that he'd been drinking.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.320
That's why I went, because
I didn't want him to get worse.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.640
You have to believe me.
I just went there to get my boy.

37:49.080 --> 37:49.920
Hey.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.920
What do you want?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.480
Is Henry inside?

37:55.560 --> 37:56.400
Yeah.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.000
You been fighting?

37:59.080 --> 38:00.760
[exhales]

38:01.760 --> 38:04.480
Ease up on the weed and whatever
else you've got inside you.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
Fuck off!

38:08.240 --> 38:09.600
About time you went home, isn't it?

38:09.680 --> 38:12.240
Or what? You gonna arrest me?

38:12.320 --> 38:13.840
- It's crossing my mind.
- [scoffs]

38:15.520 --> 38:16.720
Big fucking cop.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.480
I know about you, about all your shit.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.840
So fucking arrest me, I dare you.

38:25.800 --> 38:26.840
School fire?

38:28.560 --> 38:29.800
You and the others.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.320
Sorry. I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.840
Thought that one was gone, didn't you?

38:39.360 --> 38:40.520
Thought no one would find out.

38:40.600 --> 38:45.600
Except, she confessed,
Jenny's mum, on her deathbed.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.240
Whatever she said...

38:49.320 --> 38:51.040
Don't fucking lie to me.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.920
Don't look me in the face and lie to me.
I know.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.000
I've got proof.

38:57.720 --> 38:58.800
What proof?

38:59.360 --> 39:00.360
A tape.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.440
Security tape from that night.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.400
Showing you all,
all five of you, in the school,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.640
running away after you set that fire.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.080
- There is no tape.
- Yeah.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.920
Helen had it.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.200
She kept it all these years. Souvenir.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.640
I'm gonna show it to the police.

39:25.840 --> 39:29.480
- Look, Chris...
- People died. Kids died.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.960
You can't just get away with that.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.200
- It was an accident.
- Bullshit!

39:33.280 --> 39:34.520
You started a fire.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.640
To get back at a teacher.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.120
- We were stupid. We were kids.
- And other kids died.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.960
Chris, you can't, all right?
It's done, it's over.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.600
Okay, I've got children, a sick child.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.960
It would destroy him.
He needs me.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.320
Just think what good would this do, Chris?
Really? Please.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.240
The tape.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.840
A confession.
I've got everything I need.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.840
Chris, please. Come on.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.920
[both grunting]

40:21.320 --> 40:22.800
[Chris gasping]

40:35.960 --> 40:37.960
[panting]

41:38.720 --> 41:40.880
God! How could you just carry on?

41:41.600 --> 41:45.000
- [breathes heavily]
- And act like you didn't just kill a kid?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.600
Because I had to.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.840
To hold my family together.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.120
But every night, in my house, on my own...

41:54.000 --> 41:58.120
The guilt. Knowing what I'd done.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.200
God, I'm not... I'm not a killer, Tom.
I'm not.

42:04.160 --> 42:06.440
And if I go to prison,
who's it gonna help?

42:07.480 --> 42:10.040
It could so easily have been Rachel.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.920
No. It couldn't.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.080
Tom, look at me.
Look at me.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.320
I love you.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.360
I love you. I love you.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.840
I love you, too.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.080
So Rachel would want us to be happy,
wouldn't she?

42:31.880 --> 42:33.000
Wouldn't she?

42:47.400 --> 42:48.600
[breathes deeply]

42:48.680 --> 42:50.680
[sobbing]

42:54.360 --> 42:55.640
[Tom sighs]

42:56.640 --> 42:59.360
- I'm sorry.
- What? What?

42:59.440 --> 43:03.200
No, Tom, please. Please.
No, please, Tom, please.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.560
We have to put this right, Sophie.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.360
No more secrets.

43:07.440 --> 43:12.040
This whole mess was caused
by things being buried away.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.480
I can't be a part of it anymore.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.760
[line ringing]

43:30.120 --> 43:31.920
[operator] Emergency.
Which service do you require?

43:32.000 --> 43:32.840
Police.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.280
I'm with someone who has confessed
to the murder of Chris Chahal.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.200
[Sophie] Oh, God.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.360
[sighs]

44:50.480 --> 44:51.880
[Darren] They're obviously not here.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.560
Zoe, can we come in, please?

45:04.040 --> 45:06.200
[Jojo] A physical altercation ensued,

45:06.280 --> 45:08.960
culminating in
Christopher losing his balance

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
and falling into the swimming pool.

45:13.280 --> 45:17.800
Lauren and Jojo Marshall were seen
on CCTV leaving the hotel at 11:16.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.760
He couldn't have done it.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.440
We've got a kid at the front desk.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.880
He wants to confess
to the murder of Chris Chahal.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.440
We know you hit Chris,

45:31.280 --> 45:32.480
but it didn't kill him.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.160
He died from water inhalation.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.000
He drowned.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.960
One thing you learn in my job,
no one knows anyone, not really.
