00:05.680 --> 00:08.194
Happy anniversary, David.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.236
Don't tell me you'd forgotten.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.951
Well, no, but I...
- Nine years, David.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.430
Some better than others,
but that is still quite an achievement.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.830
Claiborne Hotels. Hello.
- Jenny, that's your mobile.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.677
Sorry. Force of habit. Listen.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.433
That's my tram, love.
I'll be home in a second - promise.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.276
Claiborne Hotels. Hello.

00:54.360 --> 00:58.035
If that was your tram,
how come you're answering this phone?

00:58.120 --> 01:01.749
All right, all right. I'm sorry. OK?
I promise - I'm on my way. Bye.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.233
I'm sorry - I didn't get you a present.
I didn't think...

01:16.320 --> 01:19.949
David, I really think
we're beyond that sort of thing. Don't you?

01:23.640 --> 01:25.596
God, I should be getting back.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.876
Not yet.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.998
OK.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.479
Hi.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.313
Hey! Hey. How was your evening?

01:43.400 --> 01:45.675
Good. Yeah, really good.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.557
Who were you seeing?

01:47.640 --> 01:50.950
Erm...just some people from work.
We went for a drink.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.349
Oh, yeah. I can taste it on you.

01:59.743 --> 02:01.872
Come on, come on.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.349
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:06.271
Pregnancy test.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.513
Yeah, right.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.556
Pete, you'd better come in.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.034
You're joking?
- There you go. You look.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.429
I can't. I'm too bloody nervous.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.996
Right, well...sleep well.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.036
Yeah, and you. Good night.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.996
Have you told him yet?

02:51.320 --> 02:54.312
But you are going to leave him?
- Yes, I am. I am.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.996
I just need to find the right time.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.155
Sorry! Sorry.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.912
Thank you very much.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.072
Sorry to have to call you back,
but I just...wanted to be sure.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.116
That's fine.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.760
Amateur dramatics?
- Fringe theatre.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.751
What's the difference?
- Isn't one.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.638
Fringe theatre? Get your kit off.
- No, you don't.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.676
Do you?
- No, you do not.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.830
She didn't even tell me about the audition.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.718
Because you'd have taken the piss
if I hadn't got the part.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.677
<i>In a minute, boys.</i>

03:32.760 --> 03:35.877
<i>Daddy!
- Come on, then. When's it on?</i>

03:35.960 --> 03:38.349
You're not coming to see it, any of you.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.715
It's really...it's worthy. It's boring.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.274
And anyway, I get very embarrassed
if I think people are watching me.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.711
Erm...do you think
you're really cut out to be an actress?

03:51.480 --> 03:55.917
Right, lads, British Home Championships.
Northern Ireland the last winners.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.753
Pete, it was our ninth wedding
anniversary yesterday.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.398
Oh, that's good.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.948
OK, me and Josh against Pete and Adam.
Come on.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.871
I mean, it's one thing to be married...

04:05.960 --> 04:08.394
David, you're in goal.
- Yeah, in a minute.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.951
...but quite another to be happily married.
- What, you two? Oh, you're fine.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.190
Hold on!
- Through his legs, Adam!

04:15.960 --> 04:18.110
We're not fine. Far from it.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.394
Just...just give it time.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.076
Look, do you want a word of advice?

04:24.160 --> 04:26.116
Yeah.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.069
You've got a better chance of stopping the ball
if you stand between the two posts. Yeah?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.597
Thanks, Pete.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.673
Are you moving on to wine then, Jen?
- No, I'm all right with water.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.638
Finally getting to grips
with your drinking problem?

04:40.720 --> 04:45.589
No. I'm just not drinking at the moment.
Am I? Am I?

04:49.640 --> 04:51.596
What?

04:52.400 --> 04:54.356
Look, I'm driving, aren't I?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.191
Erm...and...

04:59.360 --> 05:01.954
I'm pregnant.
- Jenny!

05:02.040 --> 05:05.555
Look, it's early days. We're not telling
anyone. - That's brilliant!

05:05.640 --> 05:10.156
Yeah, sort of. I mean, it is. Course it is.
It's just...the timing's not great.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.673
<i>Hey!</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:14.479
Hey! Congratulations, Jen.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.238
Pete, I thought we weren't
meant to tell anyone.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.470
I couldn't resist.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.710
Rachel, Karen, Jenny's pregnant!

05:22.800 --> 05:24.358
We know.
- She told us.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.953
You told them?
- They guessed.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.553
So did we.
- How?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.949
Pete said, ''Guess who's expecting a baby.''

05:30.040 --> 05:32.315
Oh, sod white wine. Let's have champagne.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.236
I'll open it. You sit down.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.031
<i>You're listening to the Love Doctor
on Key 103.</i>

05:42.760 --> 05:46.036
You know the football team Josh plays for?
- Mm.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.076
Did you know David's their coach?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.594
David?
- Yeah, apparently they're crap.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.750
He's asked me to give them a hand.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.400
You?
- Yeah. I know football.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.157
Yeah, but you don't know children.
- I love children.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.708
It'll be fun. First round of
the Cup next week.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.391
Well, if you've got nothing better
to do...that's good.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.476
Everything OK?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.073
Yeah. Why?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.991
Oh, nothing.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.359
Well, I just...you know. Jenny.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.077
You thought, because I can't have children,
I'd be jealous?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.678
Or upset.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.876
Adam, I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life in mourning.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.029
If it's a girl, how about er...Geraldine?

06:50.240 --> 06:53.869
Geraldine. Geraldine. Gerry. Geri Halliwell.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.316
Oh, no.
- No.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.476
Still, there's plenty of time.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.678
So, how's about you and me
and a bit of how's-your-father?

07:04.760 --> 07:08.912
Get off, you dirty sod!
Come on. I've got to get an early start.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.430
What difference will five minutes make?

07:12.520 --> 07:14.988
Five minutes? Blimey, foreplay an' all.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.158
Well, it's tempting, but...
no, I've got an early start.

07:20.240 --> 07:25.189
<i>Another great piece of music. Now,
let's get back to the phones. Hello, line three.</i>

07:27.640 --> 07:31.315
<i>I hope you don't mind me calling,
but...I just need someone to talk to.</i>

07:37.200 --> 07:38.758
Yes.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.996
Well, it's my wife.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.071
It usually is.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.355
No, no, it's not like that.
It's just that...

07:47.440 --> 07:51.638
You know, I...I did something stupid,
and my wife won't forgive me.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.838
But if I could just let her know
how sorry I am,

07:55.920 --> 07:58.195
and how much I do love her...

07:58.280 --> 07:59.998
Can't you tell her?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.877
I'm not sure she wants to hear.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.110
Well, she might be listening right now.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.430
No, this isn't her station.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.592
Although, in a strange way,
I rather hope she is.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.150
<i>Yes, she was much younger than me.</i>

08:20.640 --> 08:24.792
<i>Well, thanks for calling, and the best of
luck. I hope things work out for you.</i>

08:24.880 --> 08:27.633
That's it. Give it a thump. Nice one.
There you go.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.915
Use your other foot. Well done, Josh.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.957
Keep going. Look at the ball.
Keep your eyes on the ball.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.996
So, what do you think?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.913
Well, going on what's available,
4-2-4, I reckon.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.035
Aren't there 11 in a football team?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.389
Who was that?
- Charles Braithwaite.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.469
Here we go - there's a bluey.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.313
Adam...Josh will be in the side, won't he?

08:53.400 --> 08:57.678
David, do you think Michael Owen's dad
takes Sven-Goran Eriksson aside

08:57.760 --> 08:59.716
and has a quiet word with him?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.552
Sven who?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.995
I think...I think he's more of a rugger man.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.876
The team will be picked on ability.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.598
Oh, dear.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.591
Whistle, please.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.636
Sure.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.756
What do you think of this one?

09:20.840 --> 09:23.308
Oh, wow!
Almost makes me wish I was a lesbian.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.435
It's meant to be...provocative,
but...but not tarty.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.476
Doesn't that depend on how you wear it?

09:32.240 --> 09:35.038
What about that?
- Hi, Rach. Sorry.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.838
You remember Jo, from work?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.876
Hello.
- This is Karen.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.349
Shopping for Adam?
- Oh, no!

09:41.440 --> 09:43.908
No, this is...it's for the play that I'm in.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.434
Where's it on at? The Raymond Revue Bar?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.995
Oi, space cadet. No more swords.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.996
So, how did you get roped into this?

09:59.080 --> 10:02.152
Oh, you know how it is, Pete.
Nobody else wanted to do it.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.073
And I thought I might earn some
Brownie points with Karen.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.311
What? What do you want those for?
- Oh, you're interested now?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.630
What?
- In me and Karen.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.589
I tried to talk to you yesterday, but you didn't
want to know. I had to seek advice elsewhere.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.716
What, Adam?
- No.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.756
No, from the radio, actually.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.274
You've not been calling radio phone-ins?
- No...just listening.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.430
There's some good advice out there.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.796
There's one show in particular.
- Yeah, I know. The Love Doctor.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.111
Yeah, that's the one.
- Yeah, I was listening yesterday.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.315
Really?

10:36.440 --> 10:38.795
You called in, didn't you?
- No.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.073
Well...
- Oh, David.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.311
Does Karen know you're doing stuff
like this? - God, no.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.233
No, although I did hope she might
be listening.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.518
<i>But when I came down this morning,
there was no indication that she had.</i>

10:54.600 --> 10:58.673
Well done. David, can you remember
to take the car in to be serviced today?

10:58.760 --> 11:00.716
Yeah. Morning, Ramona.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.273
David.
Would you like a drink?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.349
<i>So, what were you hoping to achieve?</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:11.319
I don't know. I thought in time
she might forgive me my transgression.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.912
You mean affair?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.150
It was just the once.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.118
Anyway, she hasn't. She can be
very stubborn.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.760
So, you're still not sleeping together?
- Ssh!

11:23.840 --> 11:25.796
<i>Get it in! Get it in!</i>

11:29.000 --> 11:33.073
Listen. You had an affair, and Jenny
forgave you. How did you manage that?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.956
I got her pregnant.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.112
That's difficult for you,
cos you're in separate beds.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.632
Adam?
- Hey.

11:44.760 --> 11:48.389
See that kid there? She's really good.
- Yeah, I have her.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.191
David and Karen still not doing
the business. - Oh, yeah?

11:53.280 --> 11:56.158
Cos of the affair?
- Look, it only happened once.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.595
Well, you know what you've got to do?
- No.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.595
Become the man she always wanted you to be.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.999
What?

12:05.080 --> 12:08.755
Look, when you cheated on Karen,
all right, it was just the once,

12:08.840 --> 12:11.912
but you shattered any illusions
she had left about you.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.074
Start from scratch. You can't just be the man
you were before. Show her that you've changed.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.994
The best way to do that is to become the man
she always wanted you to be.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.918
Wise words, indeed.
- Not mine. Jerry Springer's.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.069
Shit. Who scored that?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.196
So, what did you say?

12:36.920 --> 12:40.469
I didn't say anything.
I just grabbed his tie, pulled him close,

12:40.560 --> 12:44.439
and kneed him so hard in the nuts,
they'll have to operate to find them!

12:45.280 --> 12:49.193
Mind you, I was lucky he was a pom.
An Aussie would see that as a come-on!

12:50.840 --> 12:53.877
Oi! Where are you going?
- Loo, and then my rehearsal.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.871
You can't.
- I've got to.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.793
Rachel, what about me? I never have any fun.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.235
Stay with Jo. Fun's her middle name.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.709
That's why I tend to use ''Jo''.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.916
Bye.
- Bye.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.468
Shall we get another bottle?
- Oh, at least.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.476
Hi, darling... Hi, Karen.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.199
Hi. Has Ramona taken the children up?
- Mm.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.316
Yeah. Josh was terrific at football.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.472
He scored three goals -
two of them at the right end -

13:32.560 --> 13:35.358
and I think Adam might even
make him captain.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.396
Oh, that's nice. What is this?

13:38.440 --> 13:42.558
Oh, this is The Spirit Of The Beehive.
It's directed by Eric something.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.235
Erice. Victor Erice.
- Yeah, that's right.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.437
Wasn't there anything else on?
- No, I got it out on vid.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.877
Oh, right. Didn't you realise it was
in Spanish? - Yes.

13:53.960 --> 13:58.078
But, David, you hate foreign films.
All those subtitles.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.754
Well, I liked Tora! Tora! Tora!

14:01.880 --> 14:05.919
I thought I might try something else,
just see what I've been missing.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.956
Right. So, tell me.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.756
What do you think?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.476
I think it's superb.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.029
It's a little bit confusing, but it's
definitely...definitely a masterpiece.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.517
Would you like to watch it with me?
- No, I've seen it loads of times.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.397
I'll go and check on the twins.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.630
You enjoy it, though.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.278
Oh...

14:36.120 --> 14:38.076
David, do you want me to...

14:38.800 --> 14:41.553
iDios mio! El Espiritu De La Colmena.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.076
What?
- This film, David, is brilliant! I love it.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.716
Turn it up.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.552
One-nil!

15:02.120 --> 15:04.076
All right, mate?

15:05.720 --> 15:08.473
<i>Paul, we don't live in an ivory tower.</i>

15:08.560 --> 15:11.597
<i>We live in society.
- Society? Society can go to hell!</i>

15:11.680 --> 15:14.911
<i>All know is that I want you,
and I don't care if you're my sister.</i>

15:15.000 --> 15:17.468
<i>No, no, no, that's not it at all.</i>

15:17.560 --> 15:19.516
<i>Look...
- Yeah.</i>

15:20.840 --> 15:25.834
<i>Let me show you. Right, you say your line.
Then you rip open Martha's blouse.</i>

15:25.920 --> 15:30.152
<i>You grab her and express everything
that's been building up inside of you. Like this.</i>

15:31.320 --> 15:32.469
Oh!

15:33.240 --> 15:36.118
Oi, oi, oi! What the bloody hell's going on?
- Adam!

15:37.120 --> 15:40.476
What are you doing here?
- I came to pick you up. I'm not the only one.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.518
We're in a rehearsal.
- Oh, well, don't let me stop you.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.273
Anyone else what to take a pop at her?
The guy on lights?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.511
I think he's gone out for his tea.
- You said it was a musical.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.113
There are songs.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.760
What, The Hills Are Alive
With The Sound Of Humping?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.035
Is this your boyfriend?
- No, I'm her husband.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.872
Are you married?

15:57.960 --> 16:01.032
You didn't tell them?
- It didn't crop up.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.395
Could you do this later? I'd like to get on.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.994
I'm not surprised.
You had your tongue down her throat.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.550
Rachel, they're taking the piss. The play
is crap. It's an excuse to grope you.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.394
Actually, maybe we should call it a day!
- That suits me, you bollocks!

16:13.480 --> 16:16.631
Come on, we're leaving. Cover yourself up.
Come on. Hup-ho!

16:17.360 --> 16:20.477
I am so sorry. I'm really sorry.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.997
Hi. Can I help?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.036
If you can recommend a hotel.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.510
I can recommend 15, actually,
dotted around the world.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.034
None in Manchester, though,
I'm afraid. Not yet.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.554
Claiborne. I've never heard of them before.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.036
Oh, well, remember the name.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.476
We're a young, expanding chain
of boutique hotels.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.074
Boutique? You mean small rooms?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.755
No, no, I mean small hotels.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.549
Small enough for our guests
to still feel like individuals,

16:53.640 --> 16:56.518
with the highest standards
of comfort and service.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.556
You sound like a brochure.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.596
Yeah. Do I? Well, there you go.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.669
Take that away with you.
It'll be like having me in your bag.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.433
So, have you ever stayed in any of
these hotels?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.309
No, actually. I can't even afford
the breakfast, to be honest.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.436
Well, I could probably rustle up enough
for a continental.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.478
Your boss should send you to one,
so you can speak from experience,

17:22.560 --> 17:23.959
not quote the brochure.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.510
Well, thank you so much
for all your useful tips and advice.

17:27.599 --> 17:31.912
Have you got any business here?
- Owen! I didn't know you were in town.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.276
Jenny, you should have told me
Mr Claiborne was here.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.432
Sorry. That was unfair of me.
Owen Claiborne.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.114
Jenny Gifford.
- I know.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.270
Oh, my God! Have you heard of me?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.952
No.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.430
I can read.
- Ah.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.991
So, which hotel would you pick?
Stockholm? Paris?

17:53.760 --> 17:55.159
Reykjavik?

17:55.880 --> 17:57.313
Maybe Rome.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.439
So, did you enjoy the rest
of the film last night?

18:01.520 --> 18:04.318
The Beehive thing? Yeah, it was very good.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.190
I did doze off a bit towards the end.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.236
Hello? Halfway.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.710
And he snored so loud,
that even I had to read the subtitles.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.509
Well, it's not due back till later.
You can watch the rest tonight, can't you?

18:17.600 --> 18:20.433
Yeah. I'll certainly look forward to that.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.590
Tickets?
- Yeah.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.432
Er...passports?
- Yeah.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.191
Condoms?
- What?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.953
No, we don't need those, do we?
- No, we don't...

18:32.040 --> 18:34.235
because I'm not going to have sex with you.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.390
I'm joking...maybe.
- Eh?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.436
<i>OK, seat belt. Mind your fingers.</i>

18:39.560 --> 18:41.312
Where to?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.356
Rome, please.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.634
Listen. Thanks for looking after Adam.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.871
I am his godfather.
Besides, I like having him around.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.676
Is Rachel all right with it?

18:54.760 --> 18:57.115
Rachel? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, she's great.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.950
Er...no. No, we had a row.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.998
<i>You're a complete bastard!
Why did you embarrass me?</i>

19:04.080 --> 19:06.992
Good to know you can still be embarrassed,
acting like a tart.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.559
Yeah, actlng - it wasn't real.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.393
Well, it looked very convincing.
- Did it?

19:13.080 --> 19:15.548
You're unbelievable. I want you
to give it up.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.997
No, I will not. Why shoulld I?
- Because I want you to. It's not...becoming.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.914
Oh, what?
And running round with small children is?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.956
What?
- Your football team.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.396
Why are you doing it, Adam?
- Because David asked me to.

19:29.480 --> 19:33.268
Bollocks!
We can't have children - end of story.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.877
And you know what? Thank goodness.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.509
Because if truth be told,
having children is just pressure to conform.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.116
You know what I've realised? I don't even
like children. They're so...so childish.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.669
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
Deep down, she really likes the lad.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.476
How deep down?

19:56.120 --> 19:58.031
Miss you. Miss you.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.273
Bye!
- Bye!

20:00.360 --> 20:02.316
<i>Bye. Bye.</i>

20:08.240 --> 20:10.196
It's only for one night, eh?

20:12.120 --> 20:14.031
<i>You're rubbish at football.</i>

20:14.120 --> 20:16.111
Yeah, rubbish.
- You play like a girl.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.556
So, who are you here for?

20:28.640 --> 20:32.315
Sorry? Oh, Adam. Adam Gifford.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.358
Oh, yeah.
I think I've heard Samantha mention him.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.396
Is he your only one?

20:37.480 --> 20:40.313
No, he's...

20:46.560 --> 20:50.030
No, he's not. No, we've got
a little girl as well.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.076
I think two's a lovely number.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.436
One's fine, but two feels like a proper
family, doesn't it?

20:55.520 --> 20:57.988
Yeah, it does, yeah.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.517
Oh, and they get on so well together,
Adam and er...Rebecca.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.988
Oh, hello, tiger!
Hello. It's me. I'm collecting you today.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.310
Hello. You must be Rachel.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.630
Yes, I am.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.676
That's not a problem, is it?

21:16.760 --> 21:20.878
Oh, no, it's just Jenny said
you or your husband would collect Adam,

21:20.960 --> 21:25.112
and, well, we have to make sure
that they don't go off with anybody strange.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.155
Thanks! That's great.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.037
OK, bye-bye.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.076
Come on. Let's go.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.274
Our car's this way.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.835
So, where do you want to go first?

21:42.920 --> 21:45.753
St Peter's Square? Trevi Fountain?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.710
Oh, ho, ho! Or AS Roma's ground?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.995
Give us the map. Come on.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.469
You look like a tourist.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.516
I am a tourist.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.396
Oh, God. What is going on?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.798
Well, it looks like a convention
of very dull people.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.519
Actually, yeah. They're insurance.
I'm gonna see if I can't do something.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.036
Go and have a nose round outside.
Give us half an hour.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.758
What?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.149
Actually, Pete, give us an hour.
- Jen!

22:26.400 --> 22:30.109
The dragon raised his ugly claws
and swiped at little Adam.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.951
Adam struck a mighty blow.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.272
The dragon gave out a terrible roar
and fell lifeless to the ground.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.876
The people cheered,
and that's how a four-year-old boy

22:41.960 --> 22:46.875
became the youngest king
that Made-Up Land ever had.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.076
And you missed the end of the story.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.793
<i>You know, I think I could write kids'books.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:06.912
Have you cleaned the bathroom yet?
- Oh, later, OK?

23:07.840 --> 23:12.709
Before I have a bath, please. I don't want to
share it with Subbuteo men and a squirting frog.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.552
Just put them on the side.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.677
You were the one
who wanted to play Happy Families.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.478
Rachel!

23:24.760 --> 23:28.594
Well, I don't know, Karen. If a husband
cheated on me, I'd kick him out.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.636
Hell, I'd kick the shit out of him.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.075
It's different if you've got children, Jo.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.390
I'd wait till they were in bed.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.950
Listen, I have not forgiven him.
I just let him share the house.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.230
He doesn't bother me, I don't bother him.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.551
Well, it all sounds perfectly civilised.
- Yeah, it is.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.916
In that way the English have
of being hateful to each other.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.276
Oh, hello. The talent's just arrived.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.110
Don't fancy yours much!
- You're the married woman!

23:58.000 --> 24:01.436
What are you doing?
- I'm just being pleasant.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.670
Listen, I didn't come out to pick up men.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.911
Well, I didn't come out with
that intention, either.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.196
Oh, my God! They're coming over.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.635
So? Oh, they're not bad-looking.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.436
One of them. You take the other one.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.112
Ramona, have you any idea where Karen is?
- Yeah, she go out with a friend.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.078
Oh, great. I got this for two.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.832
Oh?

24:28.920 --> 24:32.435
And, um...you'd be welcome to share it,
if you like.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.511
Thank you. Mm. What is it?

24:34.600 --> 24:37.637
It's Chinese. Karen's favourite.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.240
Oh, David, I'm so sorry.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.278
What, you don't like Chinese?
- Yeah...

24:50.840 --> 24:54.992
''O Chatterton! how very sad thy fate...''
Is this yours?

24:55.080 --> 24:56.798
Pl-ease.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.599
Mm. Mmm. Delicious.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.999
Hi.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.071
How do I look?
- Late.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.116
No, no, you look lovely.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.430
Oh, I got you a drink. Juice.
- Ta.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.680
Come on, I don't want to be late for dinner.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.516
What was that problem about earlier?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.556
Oh. The hotel was overbooked.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.074
Them insurance blokes weren't best happy.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.799
I presume you saved the day.
- I did. It wasn't easy.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.836
Listen, Pete, listen to me.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.434
You don't mind moving to a single, do you?
- Eh?

25:46.520 --> 25:49.114
I know. It's just they need the doubles,
OK, love?

25:49.200 --> 25:52.317
And we'll be right next to each other.
- Bloody hell, Jen!

25:52.400 --> 25:54.595
I know. I know.
- Well...

25:55.560 --> 26:00.315
Well...yeah, all right, I suppose so. But at
least we've still got the evening together.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.834
Nice, romantic meal for two.
- Buonasera.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.669
Um, everybody, this is my husband, Pete.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.954
Jenny, come and sit down.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.313
Sorry.

26:19.400 --> 26:23.188
<i>Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah. You can insure anything.</i>

26:23.280 --> 26:26.590
David Beckham's legs. Shirley
Bassey's voice.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.240
You can even insure against
insurance claims.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.231
Clive. Clive!

26:32.320 --> 26:33.389
Oh!

26:33.480 --> 26:36.199
Tell Peter
about the secondary insurance market.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.996
Sorry.
- It's fascinating stuff.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.072
Clive?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.628
Clive! The secondary insurance market.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.314
What you were telling me about
at Luton last year.

26:48.080 --> 26:53.200
<i>And United veteran Pat Crerand presents
the Manager of the Month trophy to...</i>

26:53.280 --> 26:55.874
<i>Adam Williams!</i>

26:57.040 --> 27:00.396
Thanks, Pat.
Thank you very much. Thanks very much.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.834
Do you want
to come and see the game tomorrow?

27:23.920 --> 27:24.909
What?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.558
I'll get it.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.119
It's a Cup tie.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.270
Adam, I am rehearsing tomorrow.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.111
Justin. Hi. Come in. Come in.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.430
You weren't expecting me tonight, were you?

27:39.520 --> 27:42.990
No, no, no. It's actually your husband
I was wanting to talk to.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.829
I've been thinking about
that scene you caused at the theatre.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.879
If you think I'm going to apologise...
- There it is again.

27:51.960 --> 27:52.995
What?

27:54.960 --> 27:56.791
I don't know. Je ne sais quoi.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.836
A certain...aggression.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.354
Hostility. Brando had it. James Dean had it.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.875
Tell me...have you ever considered acting?

28:05.960 --> 28:09.669
<i>Let it be known that I am only here
as a favour to you.</i>

28:09.760 --> 28:13.799
Duly noted. Now, go have fun with your guy.
I need some room to manoeuvre.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.952
You heard him, Rach.
He said I was Brandoesque.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.430
No, he didn't.
He said you were hostile and aggressive.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.149
Like Marlon Brando.
- Like...a football hooligan.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.952
Oh, yeah, my football. Could prove
tricky if we have a long Cup run.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.190
It's only one line.
- Ah-ha-ha-ha...

28:36.280 --> 28:38.316
Adam, Adam, let's get this straight.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.233
He's only offered it to you
because somebody has dropped out,

28:41.320 --> 28:44.312
we're on in a few days
and he wants to make sure that I do it.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.870
Now, now, Rach.
Professional jealousy. Not very attractive.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.116
Though you might be able to use it.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.356
David. Date for your diary, mate.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.798
Oh, my God.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.759
Listen, I think I'm gonna go
after this song.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.239
What?

29:05.320 --> 29:08.039
I said I think I'm gonna go after this song!

29:08.120 --> 29:12.159
I'll get my jacket. - No, it's all right,
mate. Listen, I'll get a cab.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.836
Great. Back to your place, then?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.993
Look, I'm married. I'm not into threesomes.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.399
What?

29:21.480 --> 29:23.072
I said...

29:23.160 --> 29:25.594
..I'm not into threesomes!

29:37.160 --> 29:39.116
Morning.
- Morning.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.076
Ramona, thanks for doing that.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.836
You were back late.
Not that that's a criticism, of course.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.915
Was it a good night?
- Yep, thanks. Very nice.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.389
I just feel a bit rough, that's all.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.436
Well, you know how it is.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.318
O for a draught of vintage! that hath

29:59.400 --> 30:02.039
Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,

30:02.120 --> 30:05.237
Tasting of Flora and the country green,

30:05.800 --> 30:07.836
Dance, and Provencal song,

30:07.920 --> 30:09.672
and sunburnt mirth!

30:11.400 --> 30:13.152
That's Keats.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.196
I know it's Keats, David.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.236
I'm just surprised you do.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.197
Well, you know how it is.

30:19.280 --> 30:23.193
I thought I might, you know,
just broaden my horizons a little.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.159
I mean, you've embraced
my interest in wine...wholeheartedly.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.835
I thought I should start to appreciate
some of the things you like.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.630
Well, I'm almost impressed.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.032
Thanks.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.279
Hiya.
- Hello, love.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.351
Sorry I didn't come down to breakfast.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.476
I still feel a bit sicky, to be honest.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.632
Do you?
- Yeah.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.836
So where do you want to go today, eh?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.876
I've been to St Peter's Square.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.238
It's a square, really.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.276
Did you go in the church?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.316
Never crossed my mind.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.197
Er...and the Coliseum.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.271
I don't mind going a second time.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.828
Sorry, love. Listen, I've got to
finish this.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.876
Well, what... Jen, what is that?

31:07.960 --> 31:12.238
It's a report for Owen.
It's just my thoughts on the hotel an' that.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.154
Aren't you taking this too seriously?
You'll be giving up work in six months.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.998
Only for a few weeks. Maternity leave.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.958
But when Adam was born,
you had three years off.

31:23.040 --> 31:28.068
Yeah, well, I'm not making that mistake again.
I mean, one shite job after another until this one.

31:28.160 --> 31:32.995
Hang on. It was you who said how important
it is for a mother to be around her child.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.833
Yeah, I said that before I had one,
didn't I?

31:35.920 --> 31:38.388
Come on, it's about striking
a balance, Pete.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.318
Well, who's going to look after him?
- I dunno. We can get some help, can't we?

31:43.400 --> 31:45.994
Bloody old Ramona
can do a job share or something.

31:46.080 --> 31:50.278
If you're so worried about it,
why don't you give up your job for a while?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.271
Me?
- Yeah.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.193
Look, I've got to finish this.
We haven't got long.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.350
Go and enjoy yourself, all right?

31:57.440 --> 31:59.635
Send my regards to the Pope.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.956
Good afternoon.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.794
Do you think it's unreasonable
to want sex three times in one night?

32:14.560 --> 32:16.596
He was hot, though. Karen thought so, too.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.432
Karen?
- Mm-hm.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.159
What...? In a nightclub?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.639
Mmm.

32:22.720 --> 32:26.110
But... Well, she's a married
mother of three.

32:26.960 --> 32:31.033
Well, they don't encourage people like that,
but they don't bar them either.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.478
OK, this is it, guys. And girls.

32:39.560 --> 32:43.030
The first round of the
Greater Manchester Under 7 s Cup.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.917
You lose today, you go home.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.073
Exciting, isn't it?

32:47.160 --> 32:50.118
Where would you rather be than right here,
right now?

32:51.040 --> 32:52.871
It's a rhetorical question.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.428
Doesn't matter. Remember what I've told you.

32:55.520 --> 32:59.149
Run your socks off, tackle hard
and don't pick the ball up.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.232
Unless you're the goalie.
And it's in the penalty area.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.072
Our penalty area.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.720
OK, you're winners now.
Let's keep it that way.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.956
Well, go on, then.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.196
Thanks for playing Josh.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.350
The team was picked on ability, David.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.599
Although he was lucky
Lucy Hick has chickenpox.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.033
<i>From the start.
Come on, blues, get stuck in.</i>

33:40.280 --> 33:42.191
Come on, Didsbury Devils!

33:42.280 --> 33:44.236
Hiya.
- Oh, hi, Pete.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.309
How was Rome?
- Oh, er...great.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.277
So, what's the score?
- They've only just kicked off.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.790
One-nil.

34:01.280 --> 34:05.239
Considering you were there one night,
you sure had a lot of dinners.

34:05.320 --> 34:09.393
I can explain this...
- You're not really suited to this job.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.597
Are you, Jenny?
- Am I not?

34:12.679 --> 34:17.150
You're clearly far too intelligent
to just be answering the phones all day.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.800
I do a bit of typing an' that.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.110
I need a new PA.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.114
A secretary?
- You'd have one, yeah.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.909
You'd sit in on meetings with me,
help plan strategy, that kind of thing.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.356
It's longer hours, more money...
based in New York.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.670
It's up to you.
- New York?

34:47.159 --> 34:49.628
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

34:50.800 --> 34:53.792
No, the other way!

34:55.159 --> 34:57.515
What is the point?
- Hard luck.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.238
Ohh! Hard luck.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.316
That is useless!
- Don't worry.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.356
Come on, get at it!

35:05.480 --> 35:06.993
Wake up!

35:08.280 --> 35:10.111
Get up, get up, get up!

35:10.200 --> 35:11.918
<i>Keep going.</i>

35:16.240 --> 35:17.832
Good goal.
- Yeah.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.309
No way is that kid six.
- Maybe he's Nigerian.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.073
What?
- They have 20-year-olds on youth teams.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.515
But with no birth certificates.
They're very good.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.160
Is that of any relevance?
- I was only saying.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.871
So er...you and Karen getting jiggy
with it yet?

35:33.960 --> 35:35.916
Really!

35:36.000 --> 35:37.831
I'll take that as a no.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.115
There have been some encouraging signs.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.633
Really?
- Yes.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.553
I took Adam's, well,
Jerry Springer's advice,

35:44.640 --> 35:47.438
and recited Karen some poetry this morning.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.909
She seemed quite impressed.
- Oh.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.632
Hey!

35:53.920 --> 35:55.956
That's good. So you know what to do next.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.235
What?
- Go for it.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.276
No, I don't think so.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.954
The bedroom door is ajar. Push it open.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.158
Oh, shit!

36:07.720 --> 36:09.233
Language.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.678
Kids here.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.996
Rach. I thought you didn't want anyone
coming to see this play.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.036
Only Adam. But now he's in it.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.637
David says he'll come.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.392
Does he?
- Mm. And Jo.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.914
That it sounds like it might be
quite a laugh.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.195
I hope not. It's a tragedy.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.430
I'll book you seats together, all right?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.397
Excellent. Thanks, Karen. Bye.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.917
Come on, poppet.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.116
In the bath. In the bath.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.479
Karen?
- Yep?

36:42.560 --> 36:44.994
Can I have a word, please?
- Course you can.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.398
What's this?

36:49.120 --> 36:50.678
What's this?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.518
What?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.556
Don't be cross, OK?

36:56.560 --> 36:58.915
You know you can say anything
you want to me.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.788
I don't think you're being
very fair to David.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.756
Pass that bottle over, Ramona.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.312
The wine.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.036
And I think you're drinking too much.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.554
Right, when I said you could say anything...

37:20.640 --> 37:23.108
Is there anything else you wanted?
- No.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.274
I just don't think you're very happy, Karen.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.193
Ooh, do we think I'm not happy?

37:35.160 --> 37:37.310
I'll have to substitute our centre-half.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.992
Why?
- He won't stop crying.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.672
It wouldn't be so bad,
but he's taking our winger out as well.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.228
Thank God for that.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.829
Adam...can I have a quick word?

37:48.920 --> 37:55.189
Um, it's a bit embarrassing but...the parents feel
that we'd better dispense with your services.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.635
What?
- You know...

37:57.720 --> 38:00.871
Twelve-nil.
- But it's only half-time.

38:00.960 --> 38:05.556
Yes, well, half the team are in tears and
half of them are just plain scared of you.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.915
And the feeling was that if I was in charge,

38:08.000 --> 38:11.470
doubtless we'd still lose
but at least they'd enjoy it.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.158
I'm sorry.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.196
Hi, Joshy. Well played!

38:20.440 --> 38:23.034
<i>You should have seen the look
on Adam's face.</i>

38:23.120 --> 38:25.350
<i>It was the only game I've ever been to</i>

38:25.440 --> 38:28.477
where the manager got sacked
halfway through.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.516
Here you go, love.
- Ta.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.231
<i>Dr Ferguson to Maternity.</i>

38:33.320 --> 38:36.790
Why do you think they've got
a picture of New York up there then?

38:37.560 --> 38:39.278
I dunno.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.037
I got offered a promotion today, Pete.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.076
It's all right. I didn't take it.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.197
Good job.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.236
Yeah, it bloody well was.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.756
It's exciting this, innit?

38:55.560 --> 38:57.152
Yeah, it is.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.070
Anything good on?
- Ballet.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.836
Oh. Mind if I join you?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.996
Be my guest.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.278
<i>From the top!</i>

39:23.360 --> 39:25.396
Why shouldn't I live with my brother?

39:28.880 --> 39:30.836
It's your line.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.831
I know. I'm acting.
Actually, Justin, I had an idea there.

39:34.920 --> 39:37.912
Do you mind if I try something?
- Yep, that's fine.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.956
Cue me again.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.316
Why shouldn't I live with my brother?

39:46.920 --> 39:48.751
No reason.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.314
Except, of course, it's a one-bedroom flat.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.356
Nothing wrong with that.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.716
But people might talk.
Friends, neighbours, family.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.270
Especially family.
Have you really thought it through?

40:06.880 --> 40:10.475
Let's stick with what's there.
Without the pause.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.196
From the top!
- Fine.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.273
Why shouldn't I live with my brother?
- No reason.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.276
You see? No-one cares.
- Oh, Rob, I don't know.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.790
Don't you love me?
- Yes, I do, but...

40:31.720 --> 40:35.554
Think of what we'd be giving up.
I do, all the time, and I can't bear it.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.714
<i>You sound like you don't give a toss.</i>

40:39.440 --> 40:41.954
Look, I'm sorry, but you never
nail that line.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.077
Have you really thought
what Martha's going through?

40:45.160 --> 40:48.232
This is a woman who, above all else,
wants to be a mother.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.316
But she won't ever be able to have children.
Think about that.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.356
OK? All right?

40:55.240 --> 40:57.196
Let's do it again.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.916
From my line, Justin?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.633
I've managed to unearth something
a bit special.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.713
Why shouldn't I live with my brother?
- No reason.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.829
You see? No-one cares.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.278
Paul, I don't know.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.430
Don't you love me?
- Yes, I do, but...

41:39.440 --> 41:41.396
Think about what we'd be giving up.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.351
<i>I do, all the time.</i>

41:48.880 --> 41:50.233
I...

41:53.120 --> 41:55.793
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.674
It's just that I so wanted to
have children, Adam.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.228
I know. I know.
- Adam, Adam. That's better.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.111
Maybe too much. Lose the tears.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.758
Justin...

42:09.160 --> 42:12.197
Will this be your first one?
- No, he'll be our second.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.953
He? - Well, it's just a feeling
I have, you know.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.996
I got our first one right, after all.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.479
So did half the people who guessed,
you knobhead.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.074
Oh, he's tiny, isn't he?
- Yeah.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.912
And he's got your eyes.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.712
I'm sorry.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.596
There's no heartbeat.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.792
What are you doing?
- Kissing you.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.711
Well, don't.
- I thought you wanted to.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.869
David!

42:43.640 --> 42:45.596
Come on, Karen. There's been a change.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.557
What?
- In me. You said so yourself.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.870
You know, the Keats, and that Beehive thing.

42:49.960 --> 42:54.033
David, four lines of poetry and a Spanish
film does not constitute change.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.588
Come on, Karen, it's a start.
- David, get off!

42:56.680 --> 43:00.514
For God's sake! The fact that you think
you've changed shows that you haven't!

43:00.600 --> 43:02.556
You are so transparent!

43:06.920 --> 43:09.354
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:11.560 --> 43:16.031
But, please, please...can you just...
Things are fine as they are. They're fine.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.238
Just...

43:19.320 --> 43:21.276
Just don't spoil everything.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.553
Sorry.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.596
I don't know what came over me.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.636
That was so embarrassing.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.836
Has my make-up run all down my face?

43:43.920 --> 43:46.150
We can have children if we want, you know.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.791
You mean adopt?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.836
The word is out there.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.076
I've thought about it.
- So have I.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.836
You didn't say anything, either.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.876
Well, you might not have been keen.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.279
I am.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.276
I'm Roy Keane.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.719
Well...I'm keen, too.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.556
Well, that's that, then.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.959
Shit.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.072
Shit, indeed.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.597
Usually when something's wrong,
your body expels the foetus

44:37.680 --> 44:39.557
and you know you've miscarried.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.518
But, in your case -
what's called a missed abortion -

44:42.600 --> 44:45.273
the foetus has died
but remains within the womb.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.076
What do you mean, no heartbeat?

44:49.160 --> 44:53.438
You must have missed something. Try again!
- The heartbeat would be very clear.

44:53.520 --> 44:57.877
And the foetus is far too small.
It stopped growing a few weeks ago.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.112
I'm very sorry.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.793
Um...

45:05.640 --> 45:07.995
I...I'd Iike to see him again, if that's OK.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.992
I haven't made a mistake.
- No, I know. I just...

45:12.440 --> 45:14.396
I want to see him again, please.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.190
I'll leave you alone for a moment.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.996
<i>God, you're so beautiful.</i>

45:39.080 --> 45:43.073
<i>Paul, Paul, I've wanted this...
since we were children.</i>

45:43.160 --> 45:46.391
I thought he was meant to be
Rachel's brother. - He is.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.232
Then...
- It's incest, David.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.194
<i>Just think of what we'd be giving up.</i>

46:01.440 --> 46:03.396
At least it was mercifully short.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.436
It's only the interval, David.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.238
Oh, God.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.390
I need a drink.
- I need several.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.836
I'm sorry, they're taken, those two.
