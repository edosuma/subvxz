[theme music]

00:07.080 --> 00:10.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.140 --> 00:14.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.089 --> 00:17.019
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:17.039 --> 00:18.199
They were good.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.010
[music continues]

00:24.100 --> 00:28.120
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.219
He was bad.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.090
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:33.119 --> 00:36.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:36.039 --> 00:38.140
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:38.159 --> 00:40.109
[evil laugh]

00:40.130 --> 00:41.170
Oh!

00:41.189 --> 00:43.119
Oh, I'll get you!

00:43.140 --> 00:46.140
'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:46.159 --> 00:49.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.030
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:53.049 --> 00:55.210
And if you are good
you may just

00:55.229 --> 00:59.020
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:00.210 --> 01:03.020
[theme music]

01:05.188 --> 01:07.189
[dramatic music]

01:07.209 --> 01:10.069
[snoring]

01:12.120 --> 01:14.090
[banging on door]

01:14.109 --> 01:16.230
[stammering]

01:18.010 --> 01:20.189
Ooh! Who in blazes can that be?

01:22.010 --> 01:23.109
'Go away.'

01:23.129 --> 01:28.039
Oh. Uh, uh, m-m-mother.

01:28.060 --> 01:33.020
Gargamel, I told you to get rid
of this miserable fleabag.

01:33.039 --> 01:34.189
[Azrael yowling]

01:34.210 --> 01:36.030
thud

01:37.099 --> 01:39.009
'You know I hate cats.'

01:39.030 --> 01:40.200
Uh, but-but, mother, I--

01:40.219 --> 01:43.109
And what about those
nasty little Smurfs?

01:43.129 --> 01:44.189
Have you caught them yet?

01:44.210 --> 01:46.159
[coughing]
Well, I--

01:46.180 --> 01:48.000
Of course not.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.140
Without me, you can't
do anything right.

01:50.159 --> 01:52.120
I'll just have
to find some weakness

01:52.140 --> 01:55.189
in those creatures
that you haven't noticed yet.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.099
Hmm, let's see.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.200
"Smurfs have no use for money.
They share and share alike."

02:01.219 --> 02:03.129
- Ha!
- Ow!

02:03.150 --> 02:06.170
Surely one of those
little imps has a speck

02:06.189 --> 02:09.210
of good old-fashioned
greed in his heart.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.099
Right?

02:11.120 --> 02:14.009
Eh, eh, right, mother.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.060
[sneezes]

02:15.080 --> 02:17.139
Luckily, I have the ultimate

02:17.159 --> 02:20.060
Smurf-smashing
formula right here.

02:20.079 --> 02:23.050
Ah, there we are.

02:23.069 --> 02:25.060
Come, Gargy,
just like we did

02:25.079 --> 02:28.050
when you were
mommy's little boy.

02:28.069 --> 02:32.189
(both)
Ooga saka waka waka.
Ooga saka waka waka.

02:32.210 --> 02:35.039
'On your way,
to the Smurfs, depart'

02:35.060 --> 02:39.039
'To find the greed
in some Smurf's sweet heart'

02:39.060 --> 02:40.129
[laughs]

02:40.150 --> 02:41.210
boom

02:43.219 --> 02:47.139
'Now, we'll get some action,
and some Smurfs.'

02:47.159 --> 02:49.009
[laughs]

03:05.000 --> 03:07.009
[rooster crowing]

03:08.120 --> 03:10.180
[yawning]

03:10.199 --> 03:12.180
Early to bed and early to rise

03:12.199 --> 03:15.090
makes a Smurf hungry
for homemade pies.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.139
[chuckling]

03:18.129 --> 03:20.099
Mmm. Why..

03:20.120 --> 03:24.099
Why, that's the smurfiest smell
I ever smelt.

03:24.120 --> 03:29.069
Huh? Where did that come from?

03:29.090 --> 03:31.069
Wow, that's me.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.150
Mmm. And that's yummy.

03:34.170 --> 03:38.139
Oh! Wait till all the Smurfs
get a taste of these.

03:38.159 --> 03:41.229
Why waste all this on them?

03:42.009 --> 03:44.069
[gasps]
Who are you?

03:44.090 --> 03:46.069
I'm the real you, pal.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.030
And if you're smart,
you'll keep

03:48.050 --> 03:50.180
these golden
goodies for yourself.

03:50.199 --> 03:53.219
[gulps]
But-but Smurfs always share.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.030
Hey, you'll never get
anywhere thinking that way.

03:57.050 --> 04:00.099
What if there's a drought
and all the food dries up?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.159
Then what will you eat, huh?
Huh?

04:02.180 --> 04:04.139
You're right. Good idea.

04:04.159 --> 04:08.050
I'd better smurf up
for a rainy day.

04:08.069 --> 04:12.189
[laughs]
I still haven't lost my touch.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.199
[blows trumpet]

04:22.009 --> 04:24.060
Like, uh, what's that?

04:24.079 --> 04:25.220
(Jokey)
Something yummy.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.060
[laughs]

04:29.029 --> 04:32.159
(Smurfette)
'It's coming
from Greedy's house.'

04:32.180 --> 04:35.090
Three hundred and two,
three hundred and three

04:35.110 --> 04:36.189
three hundred and--

04:36.209 --> 04:38.199
Oh, boy, that looks great.

04:38.220 --> 04:42.209
Uh, say, Greedy, old buddy,
uh, can we have some?

04:42.230 --> 04:44.149
Oh, sure, Hefty.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.060
Hold it. Wise up, pal.

04:47.079 --> 04:51.120
Give them one and they'll take
you for every goodie you've got.

04:51.139 --> 04:52.230
[Smurfs chattering]

04:53.009 --> 04:56.040
Uh, no, wait.
I-I've changed my mind.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.019
Oh. But it smells so good.

05:00.040 --> 05:04.050
Yeah. Uh, couldn't we
just have one little bite?

05:04.069 --> 05:05.209
Well..

05:05.230 --> 05:09.040
Why give them
something for nothing?

05:09.060 --> 05:13.089
Yeah, why give you
something for nothing?

05:13.110 --> 05:17.139
Gosh, suddenly
Greedy seems so...greedy.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.069
He doesn't want to give us
something for nothing..

05:20.089 --> 05:23.060
...but, uh,
nothing's all we've got.

05:23.079 --> 05:25.069
Oh, no, it's not.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.139
Here, Greedy.
I'll give you a whole pot

05:29.160 --> 05:33.009
of smurfberries
for one of those goodies.

05:33.029 --> 05:34.090
Small potatoes.

05:34.110 --> 05:37.090
Go for the big stuff, his horn.

05:37.110 --> 05:40.050
Uh, how about your horn?

05:40.069 --> 05:41.129
My horn?

05:41.149 --> 05:46.060
But, like,
my horn is...my horn.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.069
No horn, no deal.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.189
Okay, okay.

05:50.209 --> 05:52.230
Here, take it.

05:53.009 --> 05:55.090
One for me and one for you.

05:55.110 --> 05:57.040
Yummy!

05:58.230 --> 06:00.100
See how easy it is?

06:00.120 --> 06:03.220
Yeah. Simple as pie. Yum.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.139
Just stick with me, pal,
and you'll be a rich Smurf.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.060
[laughing]

06:09.079 --> 06:10.149
[laughing]

06:12.230 --> 06:15.149
Oh, Handy.
Just the Smurf I want to see.

06:15.170 --> 06:18.029
I've a hole in my roof
that needs fixing, and--

06:18.050 --> 06:21.069
Oh, sorry, Papa Smurf,
but I'm selling all my tools

06:21.089 --> 06:23.170
to Greedy
for two golden goodies.

06:23.189 --> 06:25.129
Golden goodies?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.189
I'd better find out
what's going on.

06:30.209 --> 06:33.110
[instrumental music]

06:35.170 --> 06:37.090
(Greedy)
'Next.'

06:38.019 --> 06:40.029
Hello, Greedy.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.060
And goodbye, old friend.

06:42.079 --> 06:45.009
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.170
But this is a lot sweeter.

06:48.189 --> 06:50.050
Yahoo!

06:52.170 --> 06:53.209
(both)
Oof!

06:53.230 --> 06:56.069
Oh! Who's there?

06:56.090 --> 06:58.209
Brainy, where are your glasses?

06:58.230 --> 07:00.139
Sorry, Papa Smurf.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.180
I just sold them to Greedy
for one of these.

07:06.170 --> 07:09.149
Oh, hi, Papa Smurf.
What's smurfing?

07:09.170 --> 07:11.230
Well, Greedy..

07:12.009 --> 07:15.089
...I'm-I'm-I'm
a little, uh, concerned

07:15.110 --> 07:18.220
about all these, uh, goodies.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.009
So, uh, perhaps I should,
he-he-he

07:22.029 --> 07:25.149
test one to make sure
everything's okay.

07:25.170 --> 07:30.170
Don't be a sucker.
Milk him for all he's got.

07:30.189 --> 07:34.120
Uh, sorry, Papa Smurf,
but you'll have to pay for it.

07:34.139 --> 07:36.199
Pay for it? Humph.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.170
Gosh, now Papa Smurf's
mad at me.

07:41.189 --> 07:44.220
So what? Soon you'll own
this whole village..

07:45.000 --> 07:46.209
...and he'll take
orders from you.

07:46.230 --> 07:49.069
[laughing]

07:49.090 --> 07:53.180
Smurfs, the time has come
to gulp our golden goodies.

07:53.199 --> 07:56.069
(all)
Mmm!

07:56.090 --> 07:59.180
Gosh, that sure was over fast.

07:59.199 --> 08:01.209
Yeah, now what do we do?

08:01.230 --> 08:05.100
I can't do anything.
Greedy has all my tools.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.139
And all my surprises.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.050
And all my weights.

08:10.069 --> 08:12.149
And the one and only scarecrow.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.060
[all sigh]

08:14.079 --> 08:17.040
I know. We'll go tell Greedy

08:17.060 --> 08:20.149
we need our stuff back.
He'll understand.

08:20.170 --> 08:26.069
And so, Greedy, old pal, you can
see that we have a big problem.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.019
Unless you give
us our things back.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.179
Gosh, Smurfs.
When you put it that way..

08:32.200 --> 08:35.120
No go. A deal is a deal.

08:35.139 --> 08:39.159
Uh, sorry, Smurfs,
a deal is a deal.

08:39.179 --> 08:41.100
I hate deals.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.000
I guess all these things
mean more to you than we do.

08:46.019 --> 08:47.120
Oh, boohoo!

08:47.139 --> 08:52.090
Yeah, we thought you were our
friend. Come on, Smurfs.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.139
[all sniffling]

08:54.159 --> 08:57.139
[Smurfette crying]

08:57.159 --> 08:59.059
Gosh.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.179
Aw, you don't need them.
They're a bunch of losers.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.090
You've got everything life
can offer. Live it up.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.009
I'll try.

09:08.029 --> 09:11.029
Maybe I'll build something
with Handy's tools.

09:11.049 --> 09:13.139
Yeow!

09:13.159 --> 09:17.220
[chuckles]
Now you're really
king of the hill, huh, pal?

09:20.009 --> 09:23.029
Maybe I'll toughen up
by lifting Hefty's weights.

09:23.049 --> 09:25.000
[groaning]

09:31.169 --> 09:34.200
That's it, push higher, higher.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.029
[grunts]

09:36.049 --> 09:39.100
There, see how easy that was?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.179
thud

09:42.169 --> 09:45.139
What are you trying
to do, get me killed?

09:45.159 --> 09:47.070
Oh, sorry.

09:47.090 --> 09:49.220
[Smurfs laughing]

09:53.090 --> 09:57.200
I sure do miss them.
I even miss Grouchy's grouching.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.110
I thought you
had their smurfball.

10:00.129 --> 10:01.159
I do.

10:01.179 --> 10:02.230
[Smurfs laughing]

10:03.009 --> 10:04.200
(Handy)
'Kick it over here!'

10:06.059 --> 10:07.169
That's a pine cone.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.179
You see, they don't need
lots of things to have fun.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.019
And by smurf, neither do I.

10:15.039 --> 10:18.000
Hey, Smurfs,
here's your stuff back.

10:18.019 --> 10:21.159
- You out of your mind, Smurf?
- Not anymore.

10:21.179 --> 10:23.120
But this stuff's
worth a fortune.

10:23.139 --> 10:27.049
My friends are my fortune.
Now, get lost.

10:27.070 --> 10:29.129
Hey. Stop. Knock it off.

10:29.149 --> 10:32.169
Greedy, what's wrong?
What are you swatting at?

10:32.190 --> 10:35.200
Oh, Papa Smurf,
you may not believe this

10:35.220 --> 10:37.120
'but there's a little red Smurf'

10:37.139 --> 10:40.009
who keeps telling me
to be really greedy.

10:40.029 --> 10:42.190
It all started
when I found that weird tree

10:42.210 --> 10:44.100
and ate that first goodie.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.139
I sense Gargamel's hand in this.

10:46.159 --> 10:49.009
But I believe
you'll overcome the spell

10:49.029 --> 10:52.090
just by continuing
to be generous.

10:52.110 --> 10:56.169
Then what are you waiting for,
Smurfs? Come and get it.

10:56.190 --> 10:58.090
(Vanity)
'Thank you, Greedy.'

10:58.110 --> 11:00.179
(all)
'Thank you.'

11:00.200 --> 11:04.210
Yuck. All this kindness
is killing me.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.009
[chattering]

11:07.019 --> 11:10.100
Oh, Greedy, we all love you.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.139
[groans]

11:15.159 --> 11:20.210
You were the richest Smurf
in the world, and you blew it.

11:20.230 --> 11:24.159
You blew it!

11:26.110 --> 11:28.090
[all cheering]

11:28.110 --> 11:32.019
- Smurf conquers all!
- Greedy isn't greedy anymore.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.200
[all cheering]

11:33.220 --> 11:37.159
(Papa Smurf)
'And now, I think
it's time we repaid Gargamel'

11:37.179 --> 11:40.019
'for his generous gift.'

11:40.039 --> 11:41.220
[Smurfs cheer]

11:43.159 --> 11:45.120
Oh, cheer up, Gargy.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.090
My magical seed of greed

11:47.110 --> 11:51.139
'will take care of those nasty
little Smurfs once and for all.'

11:51.159 --> 11:53.100
- Uh, really?
- 'Ha!'

11:53.120 --> 11:56.039
'By now, they're
probably destroying'

11:56.059 --> 11:58.149
'each other with
their own greediness.'

11:58.169 --> 11:59.179
[laughs]
