WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:04.628
THE UNKNOWN SUBJECT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:04.670 --> 00:06.797
IS A MALE, MOST LIKELY
IN HIS 20$,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.161
BASED ON
THE TWO VICTIMS SO FAR.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.461
BUT BEFORE WE GO
ANY FURTHER,

00:10.510 --> 00:12.068
WE NEED TO BE CLEAR.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.476
AGE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT
VARIABLE TO PREDICT.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.102
HE COULD BE IN HIS 40$.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.799
A VERY FIT 40$.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.647
SO OUR POINT IS,

00:19.680 --> 00:21.614
THE PROFILE
IS A GUIDE ONLY.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.686
IT'S AN
INVESTIGATIVE TOOL,

00:23.720 --> 00:25.449
AND WE NEED
TO STRESS THAT.

00:25.490 --> 00:28.186
ALL WE HAVE IS
A SERIES OF DEDUCTIONS,

00:28.220 --> 00:29.482
BUT ONE
OF THOSE DEDUCTIONS

00:29.530 --> 00:32.158
IS THAT THE UNSUB KNEW
HIS VICTIMS PERSONALLY.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.088
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
DELIVERING THE PROFILE
TO YOU,

00:34.130 --> 00:36.598
BECAUSE YOU ALSO KNEW
THE VICTIMS.

00:36.630 --> 00:40.236
SO, OUR GOAL IS NOT TO
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE

00:40.270 --> 00:41.737
OR SUSPICIOUS.
NORMALLY WE WOULDN'T

00:41.770 --> 00:44.261
EVEN GIVE THE PROFILE
THIS EARLY,

00:44.310 --> 00:46.278
BUT YOU ARE OUR BEST CHANCE

00:46.310 --> 00:48.232
AT DISCOVERING
THE IDENTITY OF--

00:48.280 --> 00:49.440
YES?

00:49.480 --> 00:51.345
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR AGENT ROSSI.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.574
GO AHEAD.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.315
WHY DID YOUR LAST BOOK...

00:54.350 --> 00:55.647
SUCK SO BAD?

00:55.680 --> 00:57.318
[LAUGHTER]

00:57.350 --> 01:00.649
UH...WELL, WE'RE NOT
GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT NOW.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.521
REALLY? THAT'S ALL
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.279
I MEAN, YOU EVEN CONSIDER
THAT TOMMY YATES WAS A PATSY?

01:05.330 --> 01:07.594
LOOK, WE GET IT, OK?

01:07.630 --> 01:09.359
YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO TRUST US.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.233
WE'RE THE FBI,
AND YOU ARE
THE OFFICIAL COMMUNITY

01:12.270 --> 01:14.591
OF THE ROSWELL,
NEW MEXICO, TRUTHERS.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.200
THANKS FOR NOT CALLING US
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.798
WELL, WE KNOW YOU
DON'T LIKE THAT TERM.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.241
WHILE WE DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR OPINIONS,
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.704
LIKE HOW SEPTEMBER 11th
WAS AN INSIDE JOB,

01:25.750 --> 01:29.288
OR HOW VAPOR TRAILS
FROM JETS ARE POISONOUS,

01:29.320 --> 01:32.687
OR HOW LIZARD PEOPLE
ARE SECRETLY RUNNING
THE GOVERNMENT.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.587
AH-AH-AH! CONFIRMATION
FROM THE FBI.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.121
YOU ALL HEARD IT.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.220
NO, NO, SEE
THAT'S SPECIFICALLY
NOT WHAT I WAS...

01:42.370 --> 01:44.622
OK. WE NEED YOUR HELP

01:44.670 --> 01:46.729
TO STOP A KILLER WHO
IS HIDING IN THIS GROUP.

01:46.770 --> 01:50.467
THAT'S WHY WE ARE HAVING
THIS HERE IN THIS LEGION HALL

01:50.510 --> 01:52.137
AND NOT
AT THE POLICE STATION.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.533
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL SURVEILLED--

01:53.580 --> 01:56.140
WHAT DID YOU PUT
IN MY POCKET?!

01:56.180 --> 01:57.841

01:57.880 --> 01:58.904

EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.709
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.682
I'M EMILY.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.427
EMILY PRENTISS.
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.826
THE REASON I'M ASKING
IS SO WE CAN HAVE
A CONVERSATION.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.828
[BREATHING HARD] DOUG.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.225
I'M DOUG.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.897
GREAT, DOUG. LET'S JUST
TAKE A SECOND.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.693
LET'S THINK THROUGH
THE LOGIC OF THIS.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.867
I--I DIDN'T DO
ANY OF THIS!

02:22.910 --> 02:24.707
WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU DID,

02:24.740 --> 02:27.470
BUT YOU ARE MAKING
THINGS WORSE WITH THAT GUN.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.705
THE REASON
WE ASKED YOU HERE,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.742
THE ONLY REASON,
IS TO LISTEN. THAT'S ALL.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.874
OK? SO JUST LISTEN.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.639
LISTEN. PUT THE GUN DOWN.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.749
I KNOW A FALSE FLAG
WHEN I SEE ONE.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.655
YOU BITCH!
NO!

03:33.310 --> 03:36.643
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

03:36.680 --> 03:40.468
NO. WE'RE HOLDING
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
FOR 24 HOURS.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.714
YOU'RE ALL
PERSONS OF INTEREST

03:41.750 --> 03:43.342
IN A MURDER
INVESTIGATION.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.688
MURDER? WHAT,
DOUG KILLED HIMSELF.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.429
TRUE. BUT THERE ARE
STILL TWO OTHER VICTIMS
TO ACCOUNT FOR.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.485
NOW, NORMALLY WHEN
THERE'S A PUBLIC SUICIDE,

03:51.530 --> 03:53.521
IT'S BECAUSE THE SUSPECT
IS THE SERIAL KILLER

03:53.560 --> 03:55.425
AND HE'S KILLED HIMSELF
OUT OF GUILT.

03:55.460 --> 03:56.722
BUT WE CAN'T
PROVE THAT YET,

03:56.770 --> 04:00.467
SO, OUR INVESTIGATION
IS STILL OPEN.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.639
HE SAID THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A FALSE FLAG,

04:02.670 --> 04:04.661
WHICH MEANS HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRYING TO FRAME HIM.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.837
I KNOW WHAT A FALSE FLAG IS.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.677
THE FBI DOESN'T FRAME PEOPLE.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.679
WHAT, NOT ANYMORE?

04:11.710 --> 04:15.942
YOU KNOW,
ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE LAWYERED UP.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.710
CALLED US NAZIS,
OR BOTH.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.058
BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.409
SO?

04:21.460 --> 04:22.779
SO THAT TELLS ME
YOU WANT TO GET

04:22.830 --> 04:27.028
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
JUST AS MUCH AS WE DO.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.597
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A PODCAST IS?

04:29.630 --> 04:31.359
I DO.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.061
WELL, I HAVE ONE.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.795
SO IF WE'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA DO THIS,

04:34.840 --> 04:36.432
YOU GIVE ME BACK MY PHONE

04:36.470 --> 04:37.801
AND I RECORD
OUR CONVERSATION

04:37.840 --> 04:40.536
FOR MY PODCAST,
'CAUSE I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU

04:40.580 --> 04:43.549

04:43.580 --> 04:46.413
YOU WANT THIS
ON THE RECORD?

04:46.450 --> 04:48.509

I WANT THIS ON THE RECORD.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.643

04:56.790 --> 04:58.451

04:58.490 --> 05:00.355
I THINK WE SHOULD
CONSIDER IT.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.698
NO. SHE WILL CONTROL
THE AUDIO.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.924
SHE CAN TWIST YOUR WORDS,

05:03.970 --> 05:06.336
EDIT THEM TO MAKE
THE BUREAU LOOK BAD.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.338
WE ALREADY LOOK BAD.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.632
THE BRASS IS GONNA
WANT TO KNOW

05:09.670 --> 05:12.377
HOW AND WHY DOUG KILLED
HIMSELF IN FRONT OF US.

05:12.410 --> 05:13.570
YEAH, AND THAT'S MY ASS,

05:13.610 --> 05:14.838
BUT I'M NOT MAKING
THIS SITUATION WORSE

05:14.880 --> 05:16.973
THAN IT ALREADY IS.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.717
GARCIA, HAVE WE CONFIRMED
THAT THIS TRUTHER'S EVEN LEGIT?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.718
GARCIA: OF COURSE I'VE
CONFIRMED THAT, AND SHE IS.

05:21.750 --> 05:26.653
MELISSA MILLER HAS A PRETTY
POPULAR TRUTH ER PODCAST,

05:26.690 --> 05:29.056
ESPECIALLY AROUND ROSWELL.

05:29.090 --> 05:30.921
SHE PROMOTES ALL KINDS
OF CONSPIRACIES,

05:30.960 --> 05:34.498
BUT HER CAUSE CELEBRE
IS STAGED SHOOTINGS.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.896
SO SHE THINKS THE REASON
WE HAVE GUN VIOLENCE,

05:36.930 --> 05:38.420
IT'S BEEN FAKED
BY THE GOVERNMENT

05:38.470 --> 05:41.689
AS A PRETEXT TO REVOKE
THE SECONNDIÃ©AEMENDMENT.

05:41.740 --> 05:43.605
IT'S ANOTHER REASON
NOT TO DO THIS.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.529
OR IT'S THE EXACT REASON
TO DO THIS.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.606
WHAT WAS TONIGHT, OTHER
THAN A STAGED SHOOTING,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.948
AND WHY IS SHE THE ONLY
ONE WILLING TO COOPERATE?

05:51.980 --> 05:53.811
UNSUBS LIKE
TO INSERT THEMSELVES

05:53.850 --> 05:55.477
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.011
PROFILE SKEWS MALE,
BUT SHE COULD BE A PARTNER.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.551
OK, THEN,
IF SHE ISN'T INVOLVED,

05:59.590 --> 06:00.716
I CAN GET HER TO TALK.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.011
I'M A FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST.

MORE DANGEROUS THAN HER.

BUT IF WE'RE WRONG, SHE'S
GOING TO POST HER PODCAST.

THEN WHAT? THEN WE'RE

ON OUR HANDS.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.415
ARE GONNA BE QUIET.

I AM AWARE OF THAT.
I NEED OPTIONS.

IT'S A TRUTHER,

IS TALKING TO US.

TELL ME HOW YOU REALLY
FEEL ABOUT TRUTHERS.

COULD USE A SENSE

06:56.180 --> 06:58.671
OF THE FBI's BIAS
AGAINST US.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.018
I GOT MY Ph.D.
BY TAKING A THEORY,

07:04.050 --> 07:07.053
TESTING IT, AND THEN
PROVING MY RESULTS.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.558
NOW, PROVING MY RESULTS MEANS
THAT I TAKE THOSE RESULTS

07:09.590 --> 07:11.126
AND I TURN THEM OVER
TO OTHER SCIENTISTS

07:11.160 --> 07:12.525
TO SEE IF THEY CAN
REPLICATE THEM.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.688
AND IF THEY CAN'T,
THEN MY THEORY WAS WRONG.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.597
SEE, THAT'S SCIENCE.
A CONSENSUS OF EVIDENCE

07:18.630 --> 07:19.995
THAT WE CALL TRUTH.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.564
WHAT YOU DO IS DIFFERENT.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.908
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.464
YES, IT IS.

07:24.510 --> 07:27.035
BECAUSE YOUR THEORIES
ARE UNPROVABLE.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.536

07:28.580 --> 07:30.844
UH, PRESIDENT OBAMA

07:30.880 --> 07:32.518
HE WAS BORN IN KENYA.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.847
PERFECT. THAT'S PERFECT.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.849
SO, I SHOW YOU HIS LONG-FORM
BIRTH CERTIFICATE,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.085
AND THEN YOU WOULD RESPOND
THAT IT'S BEEN FAKED

07:39.120 --> 07:41.213
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW DEEP
THE CONSPIRACY GOES.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.557
AND THEN THAT BECOMES
YOUR ARGUMENT

07:42.590 --> 07:44.581
AGAINST ANY EVIDENCE
THAT I PROVIDE.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.848
IT'S A COGNITIVE TRICK
THAT KEEPS YOU

07:46.900 --> 07:50.563
FROM HAVING TO ADMIT
THAT LIFE IS MESSY.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.659
IT'S RANDOM.
NOT EVERYTHING FITS

07:52.700 --> 07:55.589
THE EASY EXPLANATION
THAT A CONSPIRACY GIVES YOU.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.666
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
WELL, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE MURDERS.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.598
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
HEAR ABOUT THEM?

08:00.640 --> 08:03.700
YESTERDAY.
WHEN WE WERE INVITED IN.

08:03.750 --> 08:07.743

OUT OUR TINFOIL HATS,
MY FINE FURRY FRIENDS,

08:07.780 --> 08:11.147

BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN
ALIEN CRASH--
I MEAN WEATHER BALLOON.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.827
THE SHERIFF THERE
HAS HAD TWO
SUSPICIOUS DEATHS

08:19.860 --> 08:22.021
OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.597
BOTH VICTIMS WERE MEMBERS
OF THE TRUTHER MOVEMENT.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.667
YES, WHICH IS A GROUP
OF CONSPIRACY THEORISTS

08:27.700 --> 08:30.703
WHO SHARE THEIR OUT-THERE
BELIEFS ONLINE WITH EACH OTHER.

08:30.740 --> 08:34.198
NO JUDGMENT HERE. LET'S LOOK
AT OUR FIRST VICTIM BRYAN BEHAR.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.708
HE BELIEVED THAT THE FLUORIDE
THEY PUT IN OUR DRINKING WATER

08:36.750 --> 08:38.672
IS A MIND-CONTROL AGENT
MEANT TO KEEP US DOCILE.

08:38.710 --> 08:39.711
HE DIED BY DROWNING.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.944
PEOPLE DROWN
ALL THE TIME, YOU SAY.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.709
I SAY NOT IN
THEIR OWN AQUARIUMS.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.183
SO THE M.O. MATCHES
HIS CONSPIRACY.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.778
IS THAT A COINCIDENCE
OR A CHOICE?

08:45.820 --> 08:48.050
THAT DEPENDS ON
VICTIM NUMBER TWO.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.728
UH-HUH. THAT'S CARL LEE.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.057
HE'S A JFK CONSPIRACY NUT

08:51.090 --> 08:52.955
WHO WAS SHOT ONCE
IN THE THROAT.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.797
AS ANYONE WHO SAW
THE ZAPRUDER FILM KNOWS,

08:54.830 --> 08:56.718
THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST
BULLET STRUCK KENNEDY.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.137
CARL LEE WE CAN DEFINITIVELY
CLASSIFY AS A HOMICIDE,

09:00.170 --> 09:02.707
BUT THE DROWNING DEATH--THAT
COULD HAVE ANOTHER EXPLANATION.

09:02.740 --> 09:03.866
THAT'S WHY
WE'LL BE TREATING THIS

09:03.910 --> 09:05.639
AS AN EQUIVOCAL
DEATH INVESTIGATION.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.830
WHEELS UP IN 20.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.734
BACK UP. WHAT WAS
THAT TERM YOU USED?

09:08.780 --> 09:10.600
EQUIVOCAL SOMETHING?

09:10.650 --> 09:11.901
AN EQUIVOCAL DEATH
INVESTIGATION.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.748
IT'S AN INVESTIGATION
WHERE WE CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.839
IT COULD BE A MURDER,
BUT IT COULD ALSO BE A SUICIDE

09:16.890 --> 09:20.815
OR AN ACCIDENT
OR EVEN NATURAL CAUSES.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.727
ARE YOU SAYING THESE
MURDERS WEREN'T MURDER?

09:23.760 --> 09:26.149
IS THAT THE FBI's
OFFICIAL POSITION?

09:26.190 --> 09:28.727
I'M SAYING WE LET CLUES
GUIDE US TO A DEDUCTION.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.318
WE DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.099
BUT AS WE WERE FLYING HERE,

09:32.130 --> 09:34.690
OUR TECHNICAL ANALYST
UNCOVERED SOMETHING UNUSUAL.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.695
RIGHT.
YOUR TECHNICAL ANALYST.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.129
THAT WOULD BE
PENELOPE GARCIA?

09:38.170 --> 09:41.708
YEAH. I LOOKED UP
YOUR WHOLE TEAM
BEFORE COMING IN HERE.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.071
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

09:43.110 --> 09:45.271
BECAUSE I'M A NATURALLY
SUSPICIOUS PERSON

09:45.310 --> 09:48.177
WHO WANTED TO GET
A FEEL FOR YOUR METHODS.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.882
SPECIFICALLY THE ILLEGAL
SURVEILLANCE THAT THE FBI

09:50.920 --> 09:54.856
IS WILLING TO RESORT TO
TO FRAME INNOCENT MEN
AND WOMEN.

09:54.890 --> 09:58.087
AS I SAID, THE FBI
DOESN'T FRAME ANYONE,

09:58.130 --> 09:59.791
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T
DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

09:59.830 --> 10:03.220
WELL, I GUESS THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT GARCIA FOUND

10:03.270 --> 10:05.727
AND HOW SHE FOUND IT.

10:05.770 --> 10:08.193
SO WHAT DID SHE FIND?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.832
GARCIA: IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR TWO VICTIMS

10:09.870 --> 10:12.202
WERE TALKING VIA
ENCRYPTED TEXTS.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.400
IT TOOK A WHILE TO BREAK,

10:13.440 --> 10:15.305
AND THEIR CONVERSATION
WAS SHORT,

10:15.340 --> 10:17.149
BUT ITS CONTENT

10:17.180 --> 10:20.343
MADE MY PERFECT LY SHAPED
EYEBROWS GO, "HMM?"

10:20.380 --> 10:22.018
CARL SAYS TO BRYAN,
"I THINK I'M CLOSE

10:22.050 --> 10:23.278
TO FINDING OUT
WHO IT IS."

10:23.320 --> 10:24.719
TO WHICH BRYAN SAYS,

10:24.750 --> 10:25.944
"MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO TO THE POLICE."

10:25.990 --> 10:27.981
AND CARL SAYS,
"WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO?"

10:28.020 --> 10:29.180
WELL, THAT COULD BE MOTIVE.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.426
WHATEVER CARL
WAS CLOSE TO FINDING

10:30.460 --> 10:31.882
COULD HAVE KILLED HIM
AND BRYAN.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.295
AT FIRST GLANCE, YEAH.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.355
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS HERE,

10:35.400 --> 10:38.289
AND A LOT OF THEM SUFFER
FROM ASSOCIATION FALLACY.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.264
LET'S SAY YOU THOUGHT
LYNDON JOHNSON

10:40.300 --> 10:43.360
HAD JFK KILLED IN ORDER
TO ESCALATE THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.139
OK, STOP RIGHT THERE.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.398
WHAT?

10:46.440 --> 10:48.374
YOU GUYS HAVE A JET?

10:48.410 --> 10:49.399
YES.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.941
A JET.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.948
YES.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.709
BLACK HELICOPTERS

10:54.750 --> 10:56.047
SURVEILLING
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.342
NO, NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.779
BUT A LITTLE BRANCH
OF THE FBI

10:59.820 --> 11:01.788
HAS ITS OWN PRIVATE JET.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.687
OK, ONE, I NEVER SAID
THE FBI DOESN'T

11:04.730 --> 11:05.924
HAVE BLACK HELICOPTERS.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.451
AND, TWO, WHEN PEOPLE
ARE BEING MURDERED,

11:08.500 --> 11:09.762
WE HAVE TO RESPOND
QUICKLY.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.769
[SCOFFS] A JET.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.336
I CAN'T EVEN.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.235
SORRY.
WHERE WERE WE?

11:16.270 --> 11:18.204
LET'S SAY YOU THOUGHT
LYNDON JOHNSON

11:18.240 --> 11:21.778
HAD JFK KILLED
IN ORDER TO ESCALATE
THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.698
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT--

11:23.750 --> 11:24.774
PRENTISS: NO, NO.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.914
WE'RE NOT GETTING
INTO THAT AGAIN.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.679
GO AHEAD, LUKE.

11:30.150 --> 11:33.153
UH, MY POINT IS,
THAT IF YOU THOUGHT

11:33.190 --> 11:35.010
THE GOVERNMENT
COULD DO THAT,

11:35.060 --> 11:36.209
THEN YOU WERE LIKELY
BELIEVE THAT TH EY'D

11:36.260 --> 11:37.921
BROUGHT DOWN
THE TOWERS ON 9-11.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.825
PRETTY SOON YOU'RE
DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE

11:39.860 --> 11:41.851
AND YOU SEE
EVERYTHING AS A PLOT.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.822
SO MAYBE THESE GUYS
WEREN'T INTO ANYTHING.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.896
MAYBE THEY JUST
TALKED THEMSELVES
INTO A GROUP DELUSION.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.965
OK, WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE
THAT WHEN WE LAND.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.104
AND SINCE THE POLICE
ARE MENTIONED SO PROMINENTLY

11:51.140 --> 11:52.937
ON THE TEXT,
THEY MIGHT KNOW

11:52.980 --> 11:54.129
WHAT THE VICTIMS
WERE LOOKING INTO.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.968
THE CHICAGO MOB, RIGHT?
KILLED JFK.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.841
HE GETS IT.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.814
NO. DON'T GET HIM
STARTED, MATT.

12:01.850 --> 12:05.047
NEXT, HE'LL BE SHOWING
YOU YOUTUBE CLIPS.

12:06.190 --> 12:07.817
SO I'M SURE
WHEN YOU FLEW IN,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.851
THEY SHOWED YOU CARL
AND BRYAN'S POLICE RECORD.

12:09.890 --> 12:12.996
THEY DID. AND WHAT WE SAW
WERE 4 YEARS OF REPORTS

12:13.030 --> 12:14.952
THAT BOTH MEN WERE CONVINCED
SOMEONE WAS WATCHING THEM.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.991
BUT DESPITE HIS BEST EFFORTS,
SHERIFF BOWMAN

12:17.030 --> 12:18.918
WAS NEVER ABLE TO FIND
ANY EVIDENCE OF STALKING.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.268
OH, YEAH. 'CAUSE
HE TRIED REALLY HARD.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.904
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS
MUCH MORE INTERESTING

12:22.940 --> 12:26.876
WAS WHAT WE FOUND WHEN
WE WALKED THE CRIME SCENES.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.845
THE GLASS IS 3/4 OF AN INCH
THICK AND THAT'S STURDY.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.939
IF YOU WANTED TO DROWN
SOMEONE IN AN AQUARIUM,

12:31.980 --> 12:33.447
THAT WOULD DO THE TRICK.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.914
THEY SAID THERE WAS
A BLEACH SOLUTION
IN THE WATER,

12:35.950 --> 12:37.110
SO HE WAS PROBABLY
CLEANING IT

12:37.150 --> 12:38.378
AND HIS EAR BUDS WERE IN.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.014
MAKE IT EASY
TO SNEAK UP ON BRYAN.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.848
UNSUB WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO WORK TOO HARD.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.551
BRYAN WAS STARTLED.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.820
HE TOOK IN WATER
AND BLEACH,

12:48.860 --> 12:52.159
AND HE WAS ASPHYXIATED
BEFORE HE KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.964
HOW DID THE UNSUB
GET IN HERE?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.332
HEY, MATT,
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.304
ANY EVIDENCE OF A BREAK-IN
AT YOUR CRIME SCENE?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.103
HANG ON, JJ.
LET ME CHECK.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.471
ANY SIGNS
OF FORCED ENTRY?

13:02.510 --> 13:03.977
NO, SIR.

13:04.010 --> 13:05.898
NO, NONE HERE EITHER.

13:05.950 --> 13:09.408
WHAT I AM SEEING IS AN UNSUB
WHO COVERS UP HIS TRACKS.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.988
IT LOOKS LIKE HE SHOT
CARL IN THE THROAT...

13:13.020 --> 13:15.284
BULLET WAS
A THROUGH AND THROUGH.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.481
CAME OUT THE OTHER SIDE
OF CARL'S NECK

13:17.530 --> 13:19.020
AND WENT IN THE WALL.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.028
DUG IT OUT,
PICKED UP THE CASING,

13:21.060 --> 13:22.254
TOOK THE GUN WITH HIM.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.427
SO THIS GUY KNOWS HOW
TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIMSELF

13:24.470 --> 13:28.031
AND HOW TO GET IN AND OUT
OF TWO HOUSES WITHOUT DETECTION.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.008
JJ, LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.373
LOOKS LIKE AN RFID CARD.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.514
MM-HMM. WHAT'S IT GO TO?

13:45.550 --> 13:49.008
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.242
HUH. WELL, HELLO.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.309
HUH.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.157
THAT GUN'S MISSING.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.351
WELL, IT MEANS THE
UNSUB'S NO MASTERMIND.

14:25.390 --> 14:28.257
IT'S BEEN RIGHT UNDER
OUR NOSE THE WHOLE TIME.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.666
SO WE WENT THROUGH
CARL'S METICULOUS LOG

14:30.700 --> 14:33.589
OF HIS HARDWARE,
AND THE MISSING GUN
SHOULD BE HERE.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.460
IT IS A BODYGUARD 380.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.606
NOW, IF THE UNSUB
FOUND THIS IN
A SECRET COMPARTMENT,

14:38.640 --> 14:41.302
THEN HE KNOWS CARL,
PROBABLY VERY WELL.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.207
AND BASED ON THE FORTRESS
THAT CARL LIVED IN,

14:44.250 --> 14:46.138
IT'D PROBABLY BE
ANOTHER TRUTHER.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.171
NO ONE ELSE
COULD GET THAT CLOSE.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.212
AND THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY
AT BRYAN'S EITHER.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.389
SO WHEN CARL SAID,
"I'M CLOSE TO FINDING OUT

14:53.420 --> 14:55.308
WHO IT IS," HE WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT
SOME SECRET CABAL,

14:55.360 --> 14:56.952
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT A FRIEND.

14:56.990 --> 14:59.356
PRENTISS: SOMEONE HE WAS
WILLING TO CALL THE COPS ON.

14:59.390 --> 15:02.120
WE SHOULD BRING
ALL THE TRUTH ERS IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.525
NO, NO, THAT WON'T WORK.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.299
THEY WON'T COOPERATE
UNDER COERCION.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.333
LOOK, I SAY WE LAY
ALL OUR CARDS
OUT ON THE TABLE.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.496
LET'S DELIVER
OUR PROFILE TO THEM.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.030
OH, THAT'S RISKY.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.469
BUT WORTH IT.
EITHER ONE OF THE TRUTHERS

15:12.510 --> 15:14.398
POINTS US TO THE UNSUB...

15:14.440 --> 15:16.408
OR HE SHOWS UP HIMSELF.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.408
AND THAT BRINGS US
UP TO TONIGHT.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.645
BALLISTICS CONFIRMED
THAT THE GUN THAT KILLED CARL

15:20.680 --> 15:22.409
WAS THE ONE THAT DOUG
USED ON HIMSELF.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.384
ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS
TO DOUG DOWNEY

15:24.420 --> 15:26.479
AS OUR KILLER, EXCEPT...

15:26.520 --> 15:28.078
EXCEPT YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING TYING DOUG

15:28.120 --> 15:30.281
TO BRYAN'S DROWNING.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.959
MELISSA, I'VE BEEN AS
TRANSPARENT AS I CAN
POSSIBLY BE.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.527
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE'VE MISSED?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.390
[SIGHS]

15:39.430 --> 15:41.068
ONE THING.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.362
BUT YOU DIDN'T
MISS IT,

15:42.400 --> 15:44.539
YOU COVERED IT UP.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.209
SPECIFICALLY,
THAT THE SHERIFF

15:47.240 --> 15:50.448
MADE US ALL
WALK THROUGH
A METAL DETECTOR.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.175
WHAT?

15:52.210 --> 15:54.212
DON'T PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.274
AND DON'T PRETEND
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.083
SOMEONE
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

15:57.120 --> 16:00.283
PLANTED A GUN ON DOUG.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.428
BECAUSE WHAT WAS IT
THAT HE WAS SAYING
EARLIER TONIGHT?

16:05.460 --> 16:08.156
WHAT DID YOU PUT
IN MY POCKET?!

16:08.200 --> 16:09.553
GUN! DROP IT!

16:09.600 --> 16:11.124
[SHOUTING]

16:11.170 --> 16:13.229
MELISSA, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

16:13.270 --> 16:15.761
YOU TELL ME WHAT'S
MORE BELIEVABLE--

16:15.800 --> 16:18.530
A MISSING GUN
IN A WACKY COM PARTM ENT

16:18.570 --> 16:21.277
OR THE POLICE PLANTED

16:21.310 --> 16:23.403
A BODYGUARD 380,

16:23.450 --> 16:27.113
A VERY POPULAR FIREARM
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, ON DOUG.

16:27.150 --> 16:30.313
THEN, THEY CALL THEIR FRIENDS
ALL THE WAY IN QUANTICO

16:30.350 --> 16:33.717
AND YOU GUYS GET ON
YOUR FANCY JET

16:33.760 --> 16:37.355
AND COME OUT HERE
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE COVER-UP'S COMPLETE.

16:37.390 --> 16:40.393
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

16:40.430 --> 16:44.423
AM I YOUR UNSUB?
YES OR NO?

16:44.470 --> 16:46.461
YOU ARE A PERSON
OF INTEREST,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.388
JUST LIKE
EVERY OTHER TRUTH ER

16:48.440 --> 16:49.498
IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.269
THAT'S A YES.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.335
WHICH IS WHY I'M
RECORDING ALL OF THIS,

16:53.380 --> 16:56.634
TO SHOW THE WORLD
EXACTLY HOW FAR

16:56.680 --> 16:58.500
THE FBI
IS WILLING TO GO

16:58.550 --> 17:00.415
TO COVER UP
THE TRUTH.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.248
OK. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.279
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN
OFF TRACK.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.548
NO, NO.
NO, WE'RE, UH,

17:05.590 --> 17:08.058
WE'RE RIGHT WHERE
WE NEED TO BE.

17:08.090 --> 17:12.459
SEE, I WANTED
THE BRILLIANT SCIENCE
OF BEHAVIORAL PROFILING

17:12.490 --> 17:15.095
TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER
FOR ALL THIS.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.597
I REALLY DID.

17:16.630 --> 17:21.431
BUT RIGHT NOW,
FROM WHERE I'M SITTING,

17:21.470 --> 17:24.405
THIS CRAZY CONSPIRACY
TH EORIST

17:24.440 --> 17:27.432
IS THE ONLY ONE
MAKING ANY SENSE.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.749
GUYS, HOLD UP.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.645
CAN WE PLUG THIS IN
SOMEWHERE?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.715
YES, MA'AM.

17:37.750 --> 17:38.546
SO THIS IS
THE METAL DETECTOR

17:38.590 --> 17:40.387
MM-HMM.
YOU HAD
AT THE LEGION HALL?

17:40.420 --> 17:42.354
AND YOU MADE ALL
THE TRUTHERS WALK THROUGH IT.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.119
YEP.
AND THEN AFTER THAT

17:44.160 --> 17:45.184
YOU BROUGHT IT BACK HERE
TO THE POLICE STATIONS,

17:45.230 --> 17:46.424
YOU HAVEN'T
TOUCHED IT SINCE?

17:46.460 --> 17:47.552
SHERIFF,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US

17:47.600 --> 17:49.124
YOU WERE GONNA DO THAT?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.764
YOU TOLD US YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO SPOOK THE TRUTHERS.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.859
YOU ALSO TOLD US
THE KILLER MIGHT SHOW UP,

17:52.900 --> 17:54.868
SO THIS WAS
FOR OUR PROTECTION.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.765
CAN YOU TELL ME
I WAS WRONG?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.109
NO, SHERIFF,
YOU WEREN'T WRONG,

17:59.140 --> 18:00.835
BUT IT DOES BEG
THE BIGGER QUESTION.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.474
HOW THE HELL DID DOUG GET
A GUN THROUGH THAT THING?

18:03.510 --> 18:04.807
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD ANSWER THAT,

18:04.850 --> 18:08.115
YOU ALL BEING
THE GENIUSES WITH
THIS INVESTIGATION.

18:08.150 --> 18:10.141
JJ: NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.214
ALVEZ: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S NOT RIGHT?

18:11.250 --> 18:12.387
IT SAYS IT RIGHT HERE.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.251
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAW.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.484
DID THAT JUST--

18:15.520 --> 18:18.728
LEWIS: YEAH. YEAH, IT DID.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.648
WHAT IS IT?

18:20.700 --> 18:23.419
[BEEP]

18:23.470 --> 18:26.462
HOW IN THE WORLD
COULD THAT HAPPEN?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.195
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.468
MELISSA: BULLCRAP.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.139
BULL CRAP.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.233
BUT I DON'T WANT
THIS PODCAST

18:36.280 --> 18:37.474
TO GET AN "EXPLICIT" RATING.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.772
WELL, IT'S THE TRUTH.

18:38.810 --> 18:41.643
METAL DETECTORS REQUIRE
PRECISE CALIBRATION.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.888
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALL
KINDS OF INTERFERENCE.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.218
PHOTOCOPIERS, BLUETOOTH,
EVEN FLUORESCENT LIGHTING.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.353
THE SHERIFF WAS
IN SUCH A HURRY
TO GET IT SET UP

18:49.390 --> 18:51.529
DOWN AT THE LEGION HALL
THAT HE ASSUMED

18:51.560 --> 18:53.152
IT WOULD WORK THE SAME
WAY IT ALWAYS HAD,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.657
BUT IT DIDN'T.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.895
I STILL DON'T BUY IT.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.261
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

18:59.300 --> 19:01.188
WHY WHAT?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.208
WHY YOU DON'T BUY IT.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.265
I CAN TELL YOU.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.177
[EXHALES]

19:08.210 --> 19:10.576
IT'S CALLED
PROPORTIONALITY BIAS.

19:10.610 --> 19:12.646
YOU SEE, IT'S OUR
NATURAL HUMAN INSTINCT

19:12.680 --> 19:16.309
TO ASSUME THAT BIG EVENTS
HAVE BIG CAUSES.

19:16.350 --> 19:17.647
WE DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT A LONE GUNMAN

19:17.690 --> 19:20.682
KILLED JFK WITH A RIFLE
HE BOUGHT FOR 19.99,

19:20.720 --> 19:22.950
OR THAT HIJACKERS
BROUGHT DOWN 4 PLANES

19:22.990 --> 19:24.628
USING ONLY BOX CUTTERS.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.525
I MEAN, THERE HAS TO BE
A BETTER EXPLANATION.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.427
WE NEED AN ANSWER
THAT'S MORE SATISFYING,

19:29.460 --> 19:32.190
BUT SOMETIMES
IT JUST ISN'T.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.868
YOU KNOW?
MACHINES BREAK DOWN.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.529
SYSTEMS DON'T WORK.
LIFE IS MESSY.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.299
IT'S RANDOM.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.332
FINE. LET'S JUST TEST
YOUR VERSION, SHALL WE?

19:42.380 --> 19:43.506
LET'S.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.303
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT DOUG SNUCK A GUN

19:46.350 --> 19:48.272
THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR,
A METAL DETECTOR

19:48.320 --> 19:50.242
HE WOULD HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING WAS BROKEN.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.587
IS THAT YOUR STORY?

19:51.620 --> 19:54.657
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME A BETTER ONE.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.317
NOT MY JOB.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.555
WHAT MY AUDIENCE
WANTS TO HEAR, HOWEVER,

19:58.590 --> 20:01.491
IS HOW WELL YOUR TEAM
DOES YOURS.

20:01.530 --> 20:04.363
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHILE
AGENT PRENTISS AND I

20:04.400 --> 20:05.560
WERE FIGURING OUT
THE MYSTERY

20:05.600 --> 20:07.761
OF THE MALFUNCTIONING
METAL DETECTOR,

20:07.800 --> 20:10.564
AGENTS JAREAU AND SIMMONS
HEADED TO THE MORGUE.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.238
SO LET'S PRESUME BRYAN BEHAR
HERE DIED OF ASPHYXIATION

20:13.280 --> 20:16.238
FROM DROWNING. WHAT I
CAN'T EXPLAIN IS THIS.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.544
THESE CHEMICAL BURNS
ON HIS FACE.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.899
WELL, HE WAS DROWNED
IN A BLEACH SOLUTION.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.372
WOULD THAT DO THIS?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.978
NO. THIS LOOKS LIKE
SOME FORM

20:23.020 --> 20:24.647
OF AEROSOLIZED TOXIN,

20:24.690 --> 20:26.988
BUT DAMNED IF I COULD
TELL YOU WHAT KIND.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.284
AND THAT'S STILL
NOT THE ODDEST THING
I'VE SEEN TODAY.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.289
MR. CARL LEE,
SHOT IN THE THROAT,

20:32.330 --> 20:36.858
BUT COVERING HIS WOUND,
THIS DOOZY.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.595
THE BLOOD MATCHES
MR. LEE.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.939
MYOGLOBIN ON THE BLOOD
SAYS HE WAS ALIVE
WHEN IT HAPPENED,

20:40.970 --> 20:42.938
AND ONLY HIS PRINTS
ARE ON IT.

20:42.970 --> 20:46.337
OBVIOUSLY IT'S FROM A BOOK,
BUT I CAN'T TELL WHICH ONE.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.473
WE CAN.

20:47.510 --> 20:50.673
IT'S FROM "THE CATCHER
IN THE RYE."

20:50.710 --> 20:52.371
WOW.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.617
DOES THAT MEAN
SOMETHING TO YOU?

20:54.650 --> 20:55.776
[SCOFFS]

20:55.820 --> 20:58.687
OF COURSE THAT
MEANS SOMETHING TO ME.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.358
"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE"
HAS BEEN LINKED

21:00.390 --> 21:01.812
TO MULTIPLE KILLERS
SINCE IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.658
AND WHEN
MARK DAVID CHAPMAN
SHOT JOHN LENNON,

21:04.690 --> 21:07.329
HE SAID, "READ
'CATCHER IN THE RYE.'

21:07.360 --> 21:08.657
THAT'S MY STATEMENT."

21:08.700 --> 21:10.292
IT WAS FOUND ON
JOHN HINCKLEY'S BOOKSHELF

21:10.330 --> 21:11.399
AFTER HE SHOT REAGAN.

21:11.430 --> 21:14.433
OSWALD, MANSON,
ROBERT BARDO,

21:14.470 --> 21:15.789
THEY WERE ALL
OBSESSED WITH IT.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.535
IT WAS THE ORIGINAL
BRAINWASHING TOOL

21:17.570 --> 21:19.003
OF THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.064
I WOULDN'T CALL IT THAT.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.532
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.774
BECAUSE THEN
YOU'D HAVE TO ADMIT

21:22.810 --> 21:25.005
HOW SOPHISTICATED
THE WHOLE-SCALE DUPING

21:25.050 --> 21:26.403
OF THIS NATION
HAS BECOME.

21:26.450 --> 21:27.439
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.940
AURORA, ORLANDO,
SANDY HOOK.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.082
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

21:33.120 --> 21:35.088
SHOT UP A BUNCH
OF EMPTY BUILDINGS

21:35.120 --> 21:36.587
AND THEN GATHERED
EVERYTHING UP

21:36.620 --> 21:38.326
AND TRADED IT
AMONGST THEMSELVES

21:38.360 --> 21:42.899
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY WORKS.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.421
SANDY HOOK WAS STAGED?

21:45.470 --> 21:48.564
SAN DY HOOK WAS STAGED
THE WORST.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.500
ALL THOSE ACTORS
THEY THREW IN FRONT
OF CAMERAS

21:50.540 --> 21:52.098
TO BE GRIEVING PARENTS.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.574
I WAS SCREAMING
AT MY TELEVISION SET,

21:54.610 --> 21:56.498
"YOU'RE LYING!"

21:56.540 --> 21:58.405
AND IF THEY WOULD LIE
ABOUT THAT,

21:58.450 --> 22:01.419
THEN THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY
LIE ABOUT A METAL DETECTOR.

22:01.450 --> 22:05.511
SO LET ME MAKE ONE THING
CLEAR MOVING FORWARD.

22:05.550 --> 22:09.987
WHEN I SAY THEY,
I MEAN YOU.

22:13.830 --> 22:17.391
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

22:20.470 --> 22:24.804
[IN DISTINCT CHATTER]

22:36.820 --> 22:39.516

[SCREAMING, BANGING]

22:39.550 --> 22:43.589
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF OUTFIT
YOU RUNNING HERE, AGENT?

22:50.430 --> 22:53.433
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

22:53.470 --> 22:55.438
NO.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.435
IT'S OK TO TAP OUT
IF YOU WANT.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.745
NO. EMILY,
I CAN DO THIS.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.475
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING
THAT POINTS

23:07.520 --> 23:09.147
TO HER INVOLVEMENT
IN THE MURDERS?

23:09.180 --> 23:12.547
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
ANY ANSWERS OUT OF HER?

23:12.590 --> 23:15.718
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO CHANGE UP THE STRATEGY.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.661
WHERE'S DR. LEWIS?

23:26.700 --> 23:29.567
I'M SSA JAREAU.
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU

23:29.600 --> 23:31.807
ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE BOOK,
"CATCHER IN THE RYE."

23:31.840 --> 23:35.469
[LAUGHS] I GET IT.
YOU'RE ROTATING AGENTS NOW,

23:35.510 --> 23:37.205
WEARING ME DOWN
SO I CAN'T SEE YOUR LIES.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.502
IS THAT THE GAME?

23:38.550 --> 23:40.541
I JUST HAD SOME
INFORMATION

23:40.580 --> 23:42.616
AGENT LEWIS DIDN'T,

23:42.650 --> 23:44.083
BUT IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT--

23:44.120 --> 23:45.519
OH, NO, I WANT TO HEAR IT.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.454
[DING]

23:52.490 --> 23:56.597
SO AFTER WE FOUND
SUCH A PROMINENT CLUE ON CARL,

23:56.630 --> 23:58.860
WE WANTED TO STUDY
THE ORIGINAL TEXT,

23:58.900 --> 24:00.458
SO WE GOT A COPY
OF THE BOOK.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.639
APPARENTLY,
"CATCHER IN THE RYE"

24:02.670 --> 24:05.707
IS THE LOCAL BOOK CLUB
SELECTION THIS MONTH.

24:05.740 --> 24:08.038
AND DID YOU KNOW
THAT THERE ARE TWO ACTUAL...

24:08.080 --> 24:09.638
ALVEZ: ...BRICK AND MORTAR
BOOKSTORES IN ROSWELL?

24:09.680 --> 24:11.568
BUT ONE OF THE OWNERS
WAS HAPPY TO GIVE ME A COPY.

24:11.610 --> 24:12.577
WHAT PAGE IS IT?

24:12.610 --> 24:14.578
UH, 76. THAT'S
WHAT WAS ON CARL.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.589
OK, HERE IT IS.
IT, UH, IT STARTS
MID-SENTENCE.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.986
"DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD
LIKE A PHONY BOOK LIKE THAT

24:20.020 --> 24:22.659
AND STILL LIKE THE ONE
BY RING LARDNER."

24:22.690 --> 24:24.658
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.521
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT'S NOT RIGHT?
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.652
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAW.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.952
PRENTISS:
DID THAT JUST--

24:30.000 --> 24:32.628
YEAH, SEE, THIS PAGE 76
IS DIFFERENT.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.228
THE PAGE ON CARL'S THROAT
WAS ANNOTATED.

24:34.270 --> 24:37.194
THE PUBLISHER BOLDED
TERMS AND PHRASES
FOR EMPHASIS.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.629
WELL, THAT WOULD
THROW THE WHOLE LAYOUT
OF THE BOOK OFF

24:39.670 --> 24:41.604
AND THEN YOUR PAGE 76
WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS ONE.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.643
OK, THERE ARE TWO
EDITIONS OF THE BOOK.
THAT'S COMMON.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.615
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE PAGE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.572
MAYBE IT'S THE EDITION.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.884

THE PITCHFORKY
LITTLE DETAILS,

24:51.920 --> 24:52.909
MY FRIENDS.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.009
I MATCHED THE FORMATTING

24:55.060 --> 24:57.881
OF THE TEXT
ON POOR DOOMED CARL

24:57.930 --> 24:59.522
TO A LOCAL PUBLISHER.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.824
HE GOES BY THE NAME
OF BOB ORCI.

25:01.860 --> 25:04.567
HE WRITES CONSPIRACY-
RELATED COMMENTARY

FOR BOOKS LIKE
"BEHOLD A PALE HORSE,"

25:07.670 --> 25:09.535
"PROTOCOLS OF
THE ELDERS OF ZION,"

25:09.570 --> 25:10.662
"MEIN KAMPF."

25:10.710 --> 25:11.665
BOOKS THE TRUTHERS LOVE.

25:11.710 --> 25:14.008
RIGHT NOW WE NEED
AS MUCH EVIDENCE
AS POSSIBLE

25:14.040 --> 25:15.632
TO PROVE THAT DOUG
IS OUR UNSUB.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.671
IF HE BOUGHT THE BOOK
WE FOUND ON CARL,

25:17.710 --> 25:18.608
IT STRENGTHENS OUR CASE.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.538

25:20.580 --> 25:22.116

CAN YOU HELP ME OUT
WITH AN ADDRESS?

25:22.150 --> 25:24.880
YEAH, I'M WORKING ON
THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS
OF MR. ORCI AS WE SPEAK.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.683
THE THING IS,
HE LIVES SO FAR OUT THERE

25:26.720 --> 25:28.278
THAT IT'S NOT A PLACE
WHERE THERE ARE STREET NUMBERS

25:28.320 --> 25:29.810

27:50.000 --> 27:51.763
WH-WHAT?!
WHAT IS--

27:51.800 --> 27:53.199
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.039
GET ON YOUR KNEES.

27:55.070 --> 27:57.038
WHERE'S THE FERTILIZER, BOB?

27:57.070 --> 27:59.106
THE FERTILI--
UH, IT'S--

27:59.140 --> 28:00.732
IT'S UNDER THE TARP
OVER THERE.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.771
YES, SIR.
CHECK IT OUT.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.277
UH...

28:04.310 --> 28:07.040
NO, THAT'S, UH, MY--
MY ORGANIC TOMATOES

28:07.080 --> 28:09.913
NEED SPECIAL SOIL,
AND--AN D--

28:09.950 --> 28:11.417
TH-THAT'S MY VITAMIN
SUPPLEMENTS

28:11.450 --> 28:14.180
ARE IN THOSE BARRELS.

28:14.220 --> 28:15.187
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.188
NO, PLEASE. PLEASE.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.381
I--I SWEAR TO YOU,
I WILL SURRENDER EVERYTHING.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.398
JUST PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.125
ORGANIC TOMATOES.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.388
YEAH.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.193
AN FO STANDS FOR

28:26.230 --> 28:28.494
AMMONIUM NITRATE
FUEL OIL. FUEL OIL.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.235
YOU CAN'T GROW
ANYTHING WITH IT.

28:30.270 --> 28:31.464
WE POINTED THAT OUT
TO BOB.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.276
HE SAID THAT MUST BE WHY
HIS TOMATOES KEPT DYING.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.301
WE SEARCHED
THE WHOLE COMPOUND ANWVAY.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.443
THERE WAS NO BOMB.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.209
BUT BOB ORCI

28:40.250 --> 28:42.172
HAD QUITE THE STORY
TO TELL.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.518
IT'S ALL AN ACT.
I'M NO HERMIT.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.213
YEAH, I--
I TELL THESE TRUTHERS

28:48.260 --> 28:50.216
THAT I'M SOME KIND
OF HOLY FOOL

28:50.260 --> 28:52.182
AND THEY BUY ALL MY STUFF.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.391
BY "STUFF,"
YOU MEAN YOUR BOOKS?

28:54.430 --> 28:57.524
NO, THE BOOKS
ARE A LOSS-LEADER.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.767
BUT THE VITAMIN
SUPPLEMENTS, OH,

28:59.800 --> 29:02.439
OH, MY GOD,
I'VE MADE SO MUCH MONEY

29:02.470 --> 29:04.131
OFF THE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.365
SO, "CATCHER IN THE RYE"
IS JUST THE LATEST

29:06.410 --> 29:08.833
IN A LONG LINE OF CRAP.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.108
WELL, THE BOOK ITSELF ISN'T.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.074
AND J.D. SALINGER
IS A GENIUS.

29:12.110 --> 29:14.044
DIDN'T YOUR READ MY COMMENTARY,

29:14.080 --> 29:16.548
READ MY NOTES, ANNOTATIONS?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.810
I TRIED. YOU LOST ME

29:18.850 --> 29:20.010
WHEN YOU TRIED
TO CONNECT

29:20.050 --> 29:22.052
HOLDEN CAULFIELD TO
THE BILDERBERG GROUP.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.352
THERE IS NO CONNECTION.

29:23.390 --> 29:26.518
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
TO FOOL THESE MORONS

29:26.560 --> 29:28.926
IS TO ASK A QUESTION
THAT STARTS WITH,

29:28.960 --> 29:30.359
"ISN'T IT INTERESTING?"

29:30.400 --> 29:33.164
LIKE--LIKE--
LIKE, ISN'T IT INTERESTING

29:33.200 --> 29:36.795
THAT HOLDEN CAULFIELD
AND BILDERBERG GROUP

29:36.840 --> 29:39.365
BOTH HAVE 15 LETTERS.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.105
YEAH. AND THEN YOU TAG THAT

29:41.140 --> 29:43.301
WITH "WOW! WAKE UP, SHEEPLE,"

29:43.340 --> 29:45.103
YOU JUST SOLD
A THOUSAND COPIES.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.845
WE THINK THE KILLER
MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT

29:46.880 --> 29:48.575
ONE OF YOUR COMMENTARIES.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.542
WHO'D YOU SELL TO
IN ROSWELL?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.411
THE BOOK GROUP
IS READING

29:52.450 --> 29:54.111
"CATCHER IN THE RYE"
NEXT MONTH,

29:54.160 --> 29:57.186
SO ALL I WAS
TRYING TO DO IS
CAPITALIZE ON THAT.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.825
AND ONLY ONE GUY
SEEMED TO SHOW
ANY INTEREST.

29:59.860 --> 30:02.454
[DOOR BANGS OPEN]
FBI!

30:02.500 --> 30:03.899
OH, MY GOD.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.591
HEY, GUYS, MEET BOB ORCI.

30:05.630 --> 30:09.066
WEAPONS DOWN, PLEASE.
YOU WERE SAYING...

30:09.100 --> 30:10.863
CARL LEE.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.606
THE GUY'S NAME WAS CARL LEE.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.200
SO IT WAS CARL'S COPY.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.901
DOUG DIDN'T
BRING IT WITH HIM?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.271
WHY WOULD DOUG PUT PAGE
76 OVER CARL'S THROAT?

30:20.310 --> 30:21.379
HE DIDN'T.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.082
ONLY CARL'S
FINGERPRINTS AND DNA

30:24.120 --> 30:27.089
WERE ON THAT PAGE.
DOUG NEVER TOUCHED IT.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.883
YOU'VE LOST ME.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.615
EVER BEEN SHOT BEFORE?

30:30.660 --> 30:32.525
PEOPLE DO WEIRD THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE SHOT.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.118
[GUNSHOT]

30:34.160 --> 30:35.388
[GROANS]

30:35.430 --> 30:38.467
PRENTISS: CARL WAS
SLIPPING INTO SHOCK,

30:38.500 --> 30:41.333
MEANING HE HAD SOME VAGUE
AWARENESS THAT HE WAS GONNA DIE

30:41.370 --> 30:43.429
AND HIS BRAIN
WAS SHORT-CIRCUITING.

30:43.470 --> 30:45.859
SO THAT CLUE THAT
SEEMED SO IMPORTANT
4 HOURS AGO,

30:45.910 --> 30:47.901
IT MEANS NOTHING.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.999
LIFE IS MESSY, RANDOM.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.371
THAT'S WHY I SENT
AGENT JAREAU

30:51.410 --> 30:53.002
BACK TO THE FIRST
CRIME SCENE.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.574
WE NEEDED TO TAKE
A LOOK AT IT AGAIN

30:54.620 --> 30:56.372
WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEPTIONS.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.513
AND WHEN SHE SAW
THE CLEANING SUPPLIES,

30:58.550 --> 31:00.086
SHE HAD AN IDEA.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.351
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL

31:03.390 --> 31:05.255
HOW YOU CLEAN YOUR AQUARIUM?

31:05.290 --> 31:07.952
SO SHE HAD GARCIA
DO SOME RESEARCH.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.456
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
WEIRD SCIENCE.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.421
THERE ARE CERTAIN
TYPES OF CORAL

31:10.460 --> 31:13.293
THAT WHEN THEY COME
INTO CONTACT WITH BLEACH,

31:13.330 --> 31:15.662
RELEASE SOMETHING CALLED
A PALYTOXIN.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.136
SO THE CORAL, IT, LIKE,
EMITS THIS AEROSOL

31:19.170 --> 31:20.933
AND THEN THAT AEROSOL
CAUSES THE THROAT

31:20.980 --> 31:23.369
AND THE LUNGS TO CLOSE AND
THE EYES AND THE SKIN TO BURN.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.344
WELL, THAT'S THE MYSTERY
CHEMICAL WEAPON

31:25.380 --> 31:26.642
THE M.E. COULDN'T PLACE.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.978
SO LET'S PLAY THIS OUT.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.214
HE POURS IN THE BLEACH,

31:30.250 --> 31:32.684
CORAL SPITS OUT ITS TOXIN,

31:32.720 --> 31:36.383
AND MOTHER NATURE
DOES THE REST.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.587
[GASPING]

31:43.970 --> 31:45.699
IT'S NOT MURDER.

31:45.730 --> 31:48.437
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.508
WE'RE VEERING
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE

31:51.540 --> 31:52.939
TO BULLCRAP TERRITORY.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.109
WE COULD CALL IT MURDER.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.301
IF THE PROFILE WAS
CHARLES DARWIN'S

31:57.340 --> 31:58.978
THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION,

31:59.010 --> 32:00.648
WE COULD ARREST
THE PIECE OF CORAL, I GUESS.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.945
OR, WE COULD JUST ACCEPT
THAT LIFE IS--

32:03.990 --> 32:07.244
MESSY, RAN DOM. YEAH.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.155
UNTIL IT'S NOT.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.418
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:10.460 --> 32:12.985
WELL, THAT SEEMINGLY
UNIMPORTANT BOOK,

32:13.030 --> 32:16.659
THERE WAS ONE ADDITIONAL
DETAIL BOB ORCI TOLD US ABOUT

32:16.700 --> 32:18.292
THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION.

32:18.330 --> 32:21.458
NO, I--I DIDN'T FORGET.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.730
I WAS HOLDING BACK
FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

32:23.770 --> 32:27.365
CARL LEE.
HIS NAME WAS CARL LEE.

32:27.410 --> 32:30.004
AND THE REASON
THAT STICKS OUT

32:30.040 --> 32:32.543
IS BECAUSE HE ASKED ME
TO WRITE A DEDICATION

32:32.580 --> 32:34.070
ON THE INSIDE COVER
OF THE BOOK.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.213
IT'S SOMETHING I ADD
FOR AN EXTRA 20 BUCKS.

32:36.250 --> 32:39.048
YOU KNOW? AND SOMETIMES
I USE THE WILD MAN FONT

32:39.090 --> 32:40.648
AND THE TRUTHERS ALL GO,

32:40.690 --> 32:43.557
"OH, WOW, LOOK, HE ACTUALLY
WROTE STUFF IN MY BOOK."

32:43.590 --> 32:45.979
TARA,
WE HAVE SOMETHING.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.522
FOUND IT, EMILY.

32:53.570 --> 32:54.696
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

32:54.740 --> 33:00.098
"TO MY DARLING MELISSA,
LOVE ALWAYS, CARL."

33:00.140 --> 33:02.108
WE WERE DATING.
THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.334
SO WHY HIDE IT?

33:03.380 --> 33:05.541
THE TRUTHER
COMMUNITY IS SMALL,

33:05.580 --> 33:07.047
AND WE'RE GOSSIPY.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.172
ALSO, WE'RE ALREADY
CONVINCED

33:08.220 --> 33:09.676
AGENTS LIKE YOU
ARE WATCHING US.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.041
SO CARL AND I
COVERED OUR TRACKS.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.717
SO WELL, IN FACT,
THAT THE GREAT
AND POWERFUL GARCIA

33:13.750 --> 33:15.354
IS NOT GOING
TO FIND THEM.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.755
I BELIEVE YOU.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.326
WHICH IS WHY
WE HAD TO RELY

33:18.360 --> 33:19.782
ON OLD-FASHIONED PROFILING

33:19.830 --> 33:21.627
TO FIGURE OUT THIS NEXT PART.

33:21.660 --> 33:24.720
AND IT STARTED
WITH A QUESTION
YOU ASKED FIRST.

33:24.770 --> 33:28.194
WHY WOULD DOUG KILL
HIMSELF FOR NO REASON?

33:28.240 --> 33:33.109
SO, WE RECONSTRUCT ED
DOUG'S SUICIDE
TO SEE WHAT WE MISSED.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.732
SO YOU WERE THERE
AND I WAS HERE.

33:34.780 --> 33:35.735
RIGHT.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.236
AND THEN HE WAS
SCREAMING AT YOU,

33:37.280 --> 33:39.544
"I KNOW A FALSE FLAG
WHEN I SEE ONE, BITCH."

33:39.580 --> 33:41.116
AND THEN BANG.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.310
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

33:42.350 --> 33:44.147
HE SAID ALL THOSE
THINGS, BUT NOT TO ME.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.612
HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU.

33:45.650 --> 33:48.357
NO, NO. IF SOMEONE
MADE EYE CONTACT WITH ME

33:48.390 --> 33:50.255
AND CALLED ME A BITCH,
I'D REMEMBER.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.450
MAYBE HE WASN'T LOOKING
AT EITHER OF YOU.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.185
HE WAS LOOKING BETWEEN YOU.

33:53.230 --> 33:56.154
UH...JJ, YOU WERE
POSTED UP OVER THERE

33:56.200 --> 33:57.827
YEAH.
FOR LINE OF SIGHT.

33:57.860 --> 33:59.293
OK, THERE'S ONLY
ONE ONE OTHER WOMAN

33:59.330 --> 34:01.764
IN THE ROOM
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
TALKING TO.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.734
THE REASON
WE ASKED YOU HERE,

34:03.770 --> 34:06.466
THE ONLY REASON,
IS TO LISTEN.

34:06.510 --> 34:07.465
THAT'S ALL.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.705
SO JUST LISTEN.

34:09.740 --> 34:12.777
LISTEN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.539
I KNOW A FALSE FLAG
WHEN I SEE ONE.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.138
YOU BITCH!

34:16.180 --> 34:17.112
[GUNSHOT]

34:17.150 --> 34:18.788
IT ALL STARTED
WITH CARL'S TEXT.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.219
"I'M CLOSE
TO FINDING OUT
WHO IT IS."

34:20.250 --> 34:22.081
HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT MELISSA,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.088
AS IN, "I'M CLOSE
TO FINDING OUT WHO
SHE'S CHEATING WITH."

34:24.130 --> 34:25.779
SHE WAS CHEATING
WITH DOUG?

34:25.830 --> 34:27.422
YES. AND WHEN
SHE FOUND OUT

34:27.460 --> 34:28.791
CARL WAS ONTO HER,
SHE KILLED HIM.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.821
WHOA. SLOW DOWN THERE,
PARTNER.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.566
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S THE OLDEST
MOTIVATION IN THE BOOK--

34:32.600 --> 34:36.161
SEX. MELISSA IS CUNNING
AND MANIPULATIVE,

34:36.200 --> 34:38.634
AND SHE IS A PSYCHOPATH,
AND A GOOD ONE.

34:38.670 --> 34:41.571
I MEAN, SHE SAT THERE
WHILE I LAID OUT
THIS ENTIRE CASE,

34:41.610 --> 34:43.237
SHE DID NOT TIP A THING.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.804
NOW, DOUG'S PRINTS
WERE ON THE GUN
BECAUSE OF THE SUICIDE,

34:44.850 --> 34:48.547
BUT WITH CARL, MELISSA
COULD HAVE USED GLOVES,
AND...

34:51.150 --> 34:52.549
WHAT?

34:52.590 --> 34:55.150
WHY IS EVERYBODY
STARING AT ME?

34:55.190 --> 34:56.885
TARA, I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.856
AN ARREST WOULD RELIEVE
A LOT OF TENSION

35:00.890 --> 35:02.892
ON THIS CASE, BUT...

35:02.930 --> 35:04.090
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
THE EVIDENCE,

35:04.130 --> 35:08.134
AND WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE, WE'RE
NO BETTER THAN THE TRUTHERS.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.661
NO BETTER THAN THE TRUTHERS.

35:13.310 --> 35:16.473
MELISSA...

35:16.510 --> 35:20.241
THINKS THAT SANDY HOOK
WAS STAGED.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.541
I WAS THERE...

35:24.590 --> 35:28.185
THAT DAY, AND I COUNSELED
THOSE PARENTS,

35:28.220 --> 35:31.519
AND I SAW...

35:31.560 --> 35:34.154
I SAW THOSE KIDS.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.819
SO THE DAY THAT I LOSE
TO SOMEONE LIKE HER...

35:38.870 --> 35:41.668
THAT'S THE DAY THAT I QUIT.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.828
IT'S BIASED THINKING,

35:44.870 --> 35:47.236
AND IF WE ALLOW IT
TO COLOR OUR PROFILE

35:47.270 --> 35:50.171
AND THE ARREST
FALLS APART,

35:50.210 --> 35:52.542
WE'LL BE A STAIN
ON THE BUREAU.

35:52.580 --> 35:57.813
OK, SO WHAT, WE JUST...
WE JUST BACK OFF ON MELISSA?

35:57.850 --> 36:00.648
NO. WE BACK UP OUR PROFILE.

36:00.690 --> 36:04.854
YOU HAVE A THEORY, TARA.
NOW PROVE YOUR RESULTS.

36:04.890 --> 36:07.825
NOW, ONCE WE'RE INSIDE
MELISSA'S HOUSE,
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

36:07.860 --> 36:10.795
WELL, MAYBE
SHE CLEANED UP
CARL LEE'S CRIME SCENE.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.492
THE GUN'S ACCOUNTED FOR,
BUT THE MISSING BULLET
AND CASING AREN'T.

36:13.530 --> 36:16.260
GREAT START. WHAT ELSE?

36:16.300 --> 36:19.861
I ADMIT MY BIAS,
OUT LOUD,

36:19.910 --> 36:20.831
BECAUSE
I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE

36:20.870 --> 36:23.407
WHAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT
OF ME THE WHOLE TIME.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.807
I THOUGHT ANYONE
WHO BELIEVED
IN CONSPIRACY THEORIES

36:26.850 --> 36:30.718
HAD TO BE DELUDED.
THERE WAS NO WAY
THEY COULD OUTSMART ME.

36:30.750 --> 36:35.449
AND I WAS WRONG.
THERE IS A CONSPIRACY
IN THIS CASE.

36:35.490 --> 36:38.823
AND YOU
ARE AT THE CENTER OF IT.

36:38.860 --> 36:44.969
SO, ALLOW ME TO BE CLEAR
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.468
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE
CHANCE TO TELL THE TRUTH,

36:47.500 --> 36:51.266
ONE. KEEP IN MIND
WE ARE ALREADY
SEARCHING YOUR PLACE.

36:51.310 --> 36:55.007
IF YOU LIE, IF YOU
HOLD BACK IN ANY WAY,

36:55.040 --> 36:56.234
I WILL KNOW ABOUT IT,

36:56.280 --> 36:58.999
AND I WILL NAIL YOU
FOR IT,

36:59.050 --> 37:02.372
ALL THE WAY TO
A LIFE SENTENCE.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.217
WOW.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.555
WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS?

37:13.590 --> 37:15.626
I GUESS THERE'S JUST
ONE LAST THING TO SAY

37:15.660 --> 37:18.925
BEFORE I INVOKE MY RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.229
GOOD LUCK.

37:33.510 --> 37:34.716
ROSSI: ANYTHING?

37:34.750 --> 37:36.012
MELISSA'S HOUSE
WAS SPOTLESS.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.449
ZERO EVIDENCE
OF HER INVOLVEMENT.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.539
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

37:39.590 --> 37:41.012
YIKES.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.381
YEAH, EVERY TIME
WE TRY TO REASON IT OUT,

37:42.420 --> 37:44.285
WE KEEP HITTING
DIFFERENT WALLS.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.183
WE HAVE TO MAKE AN ARREST

37:45.230 --> 37:47.448
OR RELEASE ALL THE TRUTHERS
FROM CUSTODY.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.299
GIVE ME THE VERSION
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.922
OK, WELL, DOUG WAS HOLDING
THE GUN THAT KILLED CARL,

37:50.960 --> 37:52.996
BUT THERE IS NOTHING
BEHAVIORALLY

37:53.030 --> 37:54.463
THAT POINTS TO HIM
BEING A KILLER.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.764
AND MELISSA'S THE
UNDIAGNOSED PSYCHOPATH,

37:56.800 --> 37:57.960
AND CARL WAS FIGURING OUT
THAT SHE WAS CHEATING.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.538
AND AS HIS GIRLFRIEND,
SHE WOULD KNOW WHERE
HE HID HIS GUNS,

38:01.580 --> 38:04.003
AND SO WE--
WE'RE THINKING THIS.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.940
CARL AND MELISSA
WERE FIGHTING.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.448
PSYCHOPATHS AREN'T KNOWN
FOR THEIR SMALL EGOS

38:08.480 --> 38:10.539
OR IMPULSE CONTROL,
AND SO MELISSA GOT ANGRY

38:10.580 --> 38:12.616
AND SHE WAITS FOR CARL
TO TURN HIS BACK,

38:12.650 --> 38:14.481
CARL!
AND THEN BANG.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.559
SO SHE CLEANS UP
AS BEST AS SHE COULD,

38:19.590 --> 38:22.388
BUT NOW SHE HAS TO HIDE
WHAT SHE DID.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.560
SO WE ASKED THE TRUTH ERS
TO LISTEN TO OUR PROFILE,

38:32.610 --> 38:35.534
AND SHE THOUGHT, "A-HA!
I'LL TURN THIS TO MY ADVANTAGE.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.504
"I'LL FRAME MY BOYFRIEND,
WHO IS THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT

38:38.550 --> 38:39.676
IF THEY PUT THIS TOGETHER."

38:39.710 --> 38:41.473
SO SHE SLIPS THE GUN
INTO DOUG'S POCKET.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.579
AND DOUG WALKS THROUGH
WITHOUT INCIDENT

38:43.620 --> 38:46.009
BECAUSE THE METAL
DETECTOR IS BROKEN.

38:46.050 --> 38:47.847
HE DOESN'T NOTICE
THE GUN IN HIS POCKET

38:47.890 --> 38:49.778
UNTIL MIDWAY THROUGH
OUR PROFILING AND HE PANICS.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.721
WHAT DID YOU
PUT IN MY POCKET?!

38:52.760 --> 38:54.523
GUN! DROP IT!

38:54.560 --> 38:56.096
HE ASSUMES,
LIKE ALL TRUTH ERS,

38:56.130 --> 38:57.620
THAT NO ONE IN THE GOVERNMENT
IS GONNA BELIEVE HIM,

38:57.660 --> 38:59.389
SO HIS LAST WORDS
AREN'T TO US,

38:59.430 --> 39:00.419
BUT TO MELISSA.

39:00.470 --> 39:03.769
I KNOW A FALSE FLAG
WHEN I SEE ONE.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.438
YOU BITCH!

39:05.470 --> 39:06.664
[GUNSHOT]

39:06.710 --> 39:09.804
THAT'S THE VERSION
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.705
EVEN IF I BUY IT,
A D.A. WON'T.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.547
WE NEED MORE, GUYS.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.547
WELL, THE ONLY THING
THAT'S LEFT

39:14.580 --> 39:15.911
IS THE BULLET
AND THE CASING.

39:15.950 --> 39:17.577
BUT SHE COULD HAVE
DUMPED THAT ANYWHERE.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.485
NO, THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY THING.
THE PODCAST.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.919
SHE--SHE HAD US RIGHT
WHERE SHE WANTED.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.453
SHE COULD HAVE
POSTED THE AUDIO
OF OUR CONVERSATION

39:23.490 --> 39:25.549
TO PROVE WE WERE
TRYING TO COVER THIS UP,

39:25.590 --> 39:27.455
BUT INSTEAD SHE DELETED IT.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.752
WHICH SHE ONLY
WOULD HAVE DONE

39:28.800 --> 39:30.427
IF SHE HAD REVEALED
HERSELF SOMEHOW.

39:30.460 --> 39:31.768
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
INCRIMINATING

39:31.800 --> 39:33.392
WHEN I TALKED TO HER.

39:33.430 --> 39:34.636
ME NEITHER.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.558
THEN IT WAS ME.
SHE LET SOMETHING SLIP,

39:36.600 --> 39:38.500
SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T
WANT ME TO REMEMBER.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.429
SO, WHAT?

39:41.480 --> 39:45.109
AURORA, ORLANDO,
SANDY HOOK.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.640
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

39:46.680 --> 39:48.739
SHOT UP A BUNCH
OF EMPTY BUILDINGS

39:48.780 --> 39:50.475
AND THEN GATHERED
EVERYTHING UP

39:50.520 --> 39:51.942
AND TRADED IT
AMONGST THEMSELVES,

39:51.990 --> 39:55.414
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY WORKS.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.415
[EXHALES]

39:56.460 --> 39:57.484
SHE TRADED IT.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.726
TRADED WHAT?

39:58.760 --> 40:00.523
THE BULLET
AND THE SHELL CASING.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.027
SHE TOOK THE EVIDENCE AND SHE
GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.618
AND YOU KNOW THIS
BECAUSE...

40:03.660 --> 40:05.924
THINK ABOUT A CONSPIRACY
THEORY LIKE A PATHOLOGY.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.734
WHAT DISGUSTS HER,
WHAT SHE FEARS MOST
IN OTHER PEOPLE,

40:08.770 --> 40:09.896
THAT'S THE ACTION
SHE'LL COPY

40:09.940 --> 40:11.805
TO JUSTIFY HER OWN
BELIEF SYSTEM.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.535
SO WHO HAS THE BULLET?

40:13.570 --> 40:15.902
WHO ELSE?

40:15.940 --> 40:17.430
THE UNSUB WE'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR

40:17.480 --> 40:18.947
IS MELISSA MILLER,
AND WE THINK

40:18.980 --> 40:20.447
SHE'S MADE ONE OF YOU
AN ACCOMPLICE

40:20.480 --> 40:22.175
TO HER MURDER
OF CARL LEE.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.541
ROSSI: AN UNWITTING ACCOMPLICE.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.615
WE AREN'T KEEPING YOU
IN CUSTODY.

40:26.650 --> 40:28.208
ANYONE WHO WANTS
TO LEAVE CAN,

40:28.250 --> 40:29.956
AND EVERYONE THAT WANTED
REPRESENTATION

40:29.990 --> 40:31.548
HAS A LAWYER PRESENT.

40:31.590 --> 40:33.854
ALL WE WANT IS FOR YOU
TO LISTEN TO OUR THEORY.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.688
AFTER CARL LEE'S MURDER,
MELISSA APPROACHED ONE OF YOU

40:36.730 --> 40:38.493
AND SHE TOLD YOU
THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

40:38.530 --> 40:40.464
WAS GOING TO FRAME
BOTH BRYAN AND CARL'S MURDER

40:40.500 --> 40:41.489
ON THE TRUTHERS.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.792
RIGHT ON CUE,
WE SHOWED UP.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.502
SO, SHE GAVE YOU
A BOX OR BAG,

40:46.540 --> 40:47.837
TOLD YOU
NOT TO LOOK INSIDE,

40:47.870 --> 40:49.679
SAID IT WAS ALL PART
OF OUR COVER-UP.

40:49.710 --> 40:52.543
WHAT SHE GAVE YOU
WAS MATERIAL EVIDENCE

40:52.580 --> 40:53.842
OF CARL'S MURDER.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.745
NOW, YOU CAN THINK
WHAT YOU WANT OF US,

40:55.780 --> 40:57.919
WE ARE NOT HERE
TO FRAME ANYONE.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.839
WE'RE NOT THE MURDERERS.
SHE IS.

41:00.890 --> 41:05.884
DID ANYONE ACCEPT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
FROM HER?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.659
I DID.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.702
IT'S--IT'S AT MY HOUSE.

41:34.690 --> 41:37.113
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
MELISSA?

41:39.890 --> 41:43.929
THAT IS A MAGIC BULLET.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.158
STAND UP.

41:50.970 --> 41:53.632
MELISSA MILLER,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

41:53.670 --> 41:55.535
FOR THE MURDER
OF CARL LEE.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.832
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

41:57.880 --> 42:01.668
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

42:01.720 --> 42:07.841
* SO WE FAKED OURSELVES
ON THE ENDING *

42:07.890 --> 42:13.556
* AND BREATHE IN
THEIR LIES *

42:13.590 --> 42:19.563
* WHILE THE WATER
BRINGS NO CLEANSING *

42:19.600 --> 42:24.731
* JUST REFLECTS
STRANGERS' EYES *

42:24.770 --> 42:27.659
LEWIS: "EVERYONE IS ENTITLED
TO HIS OWN OPINION,

42:27.710 --> 42:29.905
BUT NOT TO HIS OWN FACTS."

42:29.940 --> 42:31.942
DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN.

42:31.980 --> 42:38.988
* TRUTH WAS TOO HARD
TO MENTION *
