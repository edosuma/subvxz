00:52.633 --> 00:53.633
Help.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.033
Help!

01:38.733 --> 01:41.067
Police believe the
Dundee bomber has struck again,

01:41.167 --> 01:45.167
leaving three people dead
and 22 injured,
four critically.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.267
This is eyewitness footage
from inside Mezcal bar.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.700
A busy venue in the
city centre, particularly
popular with young people.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.933
Police are still trying
to identify the so-called
running man.

01:56.067 --> 01:59.833
described by witnesses
as having left the bar
shortly before the blast.

02:00.067 --> 02:03.367
Pressure is mounting
on the police to bring an end
to the campaign of terror

02:03.500 --> 02:05.200
for which they are
yet to establish a motive.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.167
This isn't the kind of bomb
you need to run away from.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.933
It was detonated with a timer,
almost certainly a phone.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.100
The bomber could've
walked out of the bar,
calm as you like.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.200
Why would you run
and draw attention to yourself?

02:23.067 --> 02:24.600
So what have you got so far?

02:24.733 --> 02:27.833
We found this
bit of phone casing
with wires soldered to it.

02:27.967 --> 02:29.867
Part of the explosive train?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.867
We're thinking, why else
would that wire be there?

02:32.067 --> 02:35.800
We've amassed
quite a collection of wires,
haven't we?

02:35.933 --> 02:38.567
These will help us
reconstruct and show you
how the device worked.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.833
We think the device
used the same methodology
as the church hall bomb,

02:41.967 --> 02:42.933
only it's bigger.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.300
And packed with shrapnel.

02:44.433 --> 02:48.633
Ball bearings, tacks and
so far we've retrieved... 92?

02:48.767 --> 02:49.967
Ninety-four.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.533
Three-inch nails.

02:51.667 --> 02:55.633
And that's not including
the nails embedded
in the victims.

02:55.767 --> 02:59.200
Even if you don't manage
to kill anyone, you know these
are gonna pierce and tear skin,

02:59.333 --> 03:01.067
disfigure someone for life.

03:01.133 --> 03:04.433
It fits with
the iterative development
of these bombs, so far.

03:04.567 --> 03:07.067
And they're getting
bolder, nastier.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.300
They made a dud last time.

03:09.433 --> 03:12.200
Partly detonated bomb
outside the gym.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.833
Overreached themselves, maybe.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.533
So now they're reverting
to what they know.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.467
How to make a pipe bomb.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.967
Only, they've elevated it.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.267
They've made another pipe bomb
and they've made it bigger.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.333
I can tell you how
based on scientific facts.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.367
But I can't speculate as to why.

03:38.267 --> 03:40.733
Lots of folk haven't come in
today because of the bomb.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.433
The Dean has. This is your
five-minute warning.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.867
-Okay, thank you.
Can I show you something?
-Sure.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.133
This was done by
a facial reconstruction team
working from a CT scan

03:53.267 --> 03:54.933
of a skull and jawbone.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.700
Is this the head that got
driven back to Cornwall?

03:56.833 --> 03:58.267
No, this is the other head.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.700
And here is the real boy.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.200
-Wow! This is poor
Euan McMillan.
-Yeah.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.367
Did you ever see him around?

04:07.500 --> 04:10.200
I may have passed him in
the sea of young faces, but no.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.300
The first I heard of him
is in the paper.

04:12.433 --> 04:14.100
Is this how they identified him?

04:14.233 --> 04:17.400
No, the police found his ID
near the lock
and contacted his parents.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.333
-And they identified
his remains?
-No.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.933
Euan's remains weren't something
you'd want a parent to see.

04:23.067 --> 04:27.267
The family gave the police
a toothbrush of Euan's and
they got a DNA match that way.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.267
This just arrived today,
too late.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.067
He lied to his family.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.833
He'd told them he'd arranged
with the university to take
a year out of his studies...

04:37.967 --> 04:40.067
-And he hadn't?
-No, he dropped out.

04:41.567 --> 04:44.633
He told his parents he was
camping in Spain, off grid.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.800
He was less than two hours
from home.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.667
Was he depressed?

04:49.800 --> 04:53.067
Well, judging from
how it looks like he died,

04:53.167 --> 04:56.200
I'd say he was
a deeply unhappy boy.

04:58.067 --> 05:01.100
The CCTV at the entrance
was destroyed.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.867
But the witnesses
near the entrance
were the worst hurt.

05:04.067 --> 05:06.233
We can't get to them.
That's why it's such
a shit show.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.467
Tracing running man?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.633
Not tracing him, aye.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.400
Understanding these devices
is fantastic.

05:14.533 --> 05:19.367
We're desperate for any evidence
that physically identifies
the bomber.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.367
Hello.

05:28.900 --> 05:29.900
Hi.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.067
How are ya?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.067
Bit crazy.

05:35.567 --> 05:36.633
Me too.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.667
Come on, Safi.

05:47.233 --> 05:50.367
I'm sorry if the way
I expressed myself
at this showcase seemed...

05:50.500 --> 05:51.767
Graceless?

05:52.900 --> 05:54.367
Direct.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.300
I was warned about academics.

05:56.433 --> 05:57.867
-Were you?
-Yes.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.233
"Watch out for academics.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.767
"They're resistant to change
and they don't like
being managed."

06:02.900 --> 06:04.533
I don't like being micro-managed

06:04.667 --> 06:07.433
or hearing something
I didn't agree to do
being announced in public.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.067
I had to throw
the donors a bone.

06:09.167 --> 06:12.167
Students want to study
forensic science because
it has profile

06:12.300 --> 06:14.733
but there's not as much work
out there as people think.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.800
Now, the undergraduate course
we run at the moment,

06:17.933 --> 06:21.900
the scale of it, the modules,
the teacher-student ratio,

06:22.067 --> 06:26.300
is designed to teach real
science to a high standard
so the people who graduate

06:26.433 --> 06:29.967
are qualified to go into
all kinds of science,
not just forensic science.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.133
That's students first,
right there.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.333
Quality of teaching,
not quantity.

06:35.467 --> 06:38.300
That's not a profitable view.

06:38.433 --> 06:41.567
I'm not resistant to change.
I'm resistant to

06:41.700 --> 06:44.067
ideas I don't think will work.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.867
You're resistant to my ideas.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.833
-Is there a bit of intellectual
snobbery going on here?
-No.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.533
I may not write academic papers

06:50.667 --> 06:52.167
but I do know
how to run a business

06:52.300 --> 06:54.233
and I do know about people.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.967
You're such a brilliant woman
and such an asset,

06:57.100 --> 06:59.267
I'd absolutely hate
for us to fall out.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.633
I've just been reading about
you and McMillan.

07:03.767 --> 07:05.267
Awful.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.700
Were you involved
in recovering his body
or have I got that wrong?

07:07.833 --> 07:11.467
-I was.
-The news reports don't
explain the circumstances.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.067
No, well there'll be
a fatal accident enquiry.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.333
So, it was an accident?

07:15.467 --> 07:17.900
I don't discuss
case work with anyone.

07:18.067 --> 07:21.700
Oh, come on! I'm not anyone.
I'm the Dean of the School
of Science!

07:21.833 --> 07:25.133
Euan McMillan was
a Physics graduate here.
It concerns me.

07:25.267 --> 07:26.933
Just because it happened
before my time,

07:27.067 --> 07:29.400
doesn't mean I don't take
a compassionate interest.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.700
I can't help you.

07:31.833 --> 07:34.767
And he didn't graduate.
He withdrew. Dropped out.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.867
You're not a team player,
are you?

07:38.067 --> 07:39.533
Depends on the team.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.767
Two more witnesses
in hospital are ready
to talk to us.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.067
Great.

07:46.167 --> 07:48.167
What's the story with
the food-delivery riders?

07:48.300 --> 07:49.933
-Do we have order numbers yet?
-No.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.867
-Neil.
-Oh. Hi, Kathy.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.333
How're you holding up?

07:54.467 --> 07:55.667
You know...

07:55.800 --> 07:57.300
Wish we'd got a bit
further ahead than we are.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.067
-Sure.
-I'm sorry, Kathy, got to go.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.933
She wanted to find out
from me if Euan McMillan
committed suicide?

08:07.067 --> 08:08.467
-You didn't tell her.
-No!

08:08.600 --> 08:11.233
Because it would be unethical
or because you don't like her.

08:11.367 --> 08:12.467
I don't need to like her.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.667
If I needed to like everyone,
I'd kill myself.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.267
This isn't about not liking her.
I don't trust her!

08:18.400 --> 08:22.433
No... I actively suspect her.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.933
-Of what?
-I don't know yet,
but I know I'm right.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.267
She's putting on an act.
She's faking something.

08:30.267 --> 08:33.567
Okay, well,
try not to demonise her.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.700
I'm having a beer with Euan's
Advisor of Studies tonight.
I have questions.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.767
-Can I tell you what I would do?
-Be discreet? I know.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.633
Before I talked to
his Advisor of Studies,

08:42.767 --> 08:45.067
I would start with the President
of the Students' Union.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.700
He knows the temperature
of the University.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.433
Then I'd go to Polly,
who runs the shop.
She knows everything.

08:49.567 --> 08:52.800
I would gather as many stories
as you can, then,
cross triangulate,

08:52.933 --> 08:55.167
find the real story.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.267
This is what the cake and charm
is really about, right?

08:58.400 --> 08:59.900
Allegiances.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.100
You're a political strategist
disguised as a school girl.

09:03.233 --> 09:07.333
I just try and understand
the politics of what happens
between people.

09:09.267 --> 09:10.567
Has Neil lost weight?
He looks...

09:10.700 --> 09:11.767
Well, the pressure
he's under...

09:11.900 --> 09:13.433
No, totally.
That's what I was thinking.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.967
We're under siege.
No one thinks we're capable.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.967
-Well, Sarah, you are.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.833
-Kathy, Erika's looking for you.
-Thanks.

09:21.967 --> 09:25.700
Hey, Janine. Do you agree
with me that Sarah is not
as innocent as she looks?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.667
Wholeheartedly.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.533
You called?

09:35.667 --> 09:38.067
I'm not sure I'm going
to be able to complete
the report this week.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.933
How come?

09:40.067 --> 09:42.600
Because I also have to prepare
the demonstrations for
six classes and write up

09:42.733 --> 09:44.533
the total body scores
for this week's data and...

09:44.667 --> 09:46.533
When can you have it done by?

09:46.667 --> 09:49.100
Um, Monday, maybe?

09:49.233 --> 09:50.267
Tuesday, possibly.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.933
Okay. We can skip
the variables.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.567
Just get it in
as soon as you can.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.833
The other devices
didn't use parcel tape.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.433
Finn, look.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.100
This stuff's
so thin and sticky,

10:12.233 --> 10:14.133
it's a nightmare to handle.
So, I'm wondering,

10:14.267 --> 10:17.533
could John roll a section of it
with gloves on?

10:17.667 --> 10:20.300
Or might you ditch them
in frustration?

10:20.433 --> 10:21.933
And leave a fingerprint.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.733
Erika?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.767
I'm looking
for Professor Torrance.
Do you know where she is?

10:28.900 --> 10:29.900
Nope.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.633
You don't look like
a very happy bunny.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.533
Oh, just tired.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.467
Forgive me for not knowing this,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.667
I came from business, you see.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.533
But, is this study
also your PhD?

10:46.667 --> 10:49.100
Yes, studying decomposition
in water.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.633
Right. But that's the study?

10:50.767 --> 10:52.933
Actually, no.
The whole study is

10:53.067 --> 10:56.367
Comparing Decomposition on Land
and in Water in Scotland.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.600
I see, and that is
authored by...

10:58.733 --> 11:00.933
That will be co-authored by
Professor Torrance and me.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.633
But the water research is yours.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.567
Mmm-hmm.

11:04.700 --> 11:08.200
I was very interested to see
the talk Professor Torrance
gave in Santorini.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.667
Have you seen it?

11:09.800 --> 11:12.467
-No.
-I think you'll find it
interesting, too.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.900
You in particular.
I'll send you a link.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.467
Black pill.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.867
You and Sarah brought it to us
weeks ago.

11:24.067 --> 11:25.667
We parked it.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.733
This just appeared
on our twitter account.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.067
SO15 want a meeting, now!

11:39.867 --> 11:44.767
Well, black pill is a term
used by INCEL or
Involuntary Celibate Community.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.500
It's a sub-culture.

11:46.633 --> 11:49.300
An online community, mostly.
American, mostly.

11:49.433 --> 11:53.200
Black pill is short-hand
for the state of hopelessness

11:53.333 --> 11:58.067
of being a man who is denied sex
because of the way
he looks, basically.

11:58.167 --> 12:02.533
-Can you trace a GIF?
-No. No, there is no metadata
on a GIF file.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.067
We've put in
a communication data request

12:05.200 --> 12:06.733
for logs of IP addresses

12:06.867 --> 12:09.467
which visited the site
when the GIF was posted.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.567
So this is maybe posted
by running man himself
or someone, the bomber,

12:13.700 --> 12:17.067
taunting us by combining
the black pill with running man.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.700
-Any trace of a black pill
with this bomb?
-No.

12:19.833 --> 12:22.233
-Any sign of a hashtag four?
-No.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.333
Professor Gordon did discover
a fingerprint on this
latest device.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.567
That's with our lab,
fast tracked.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.067
So sorry.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.167
Thank you for all your work,
Professor Gordon.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.367
You're very welcome.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.633
You're not gonna be needed
anymore.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.767
Oh, right. As in...

12:37.900 --> 12:40.767
All the productions and evidence
will be returned
to Porton Down.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.500
Thanks again.

12:45.333 --> 12:48.600
We'll come and get
your case file. Would
this afternoon suit you?

12:48.733 --> 12:50.267
Yeah. Yup.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.200
What a terrible way
to do that.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.800
-Honest to God...
-Neil!

12:58.933 --> 13:01.700
Sarah's fanta...
Her work is fantastic!

13:01.833 --> 13:03.467
That's not in question.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.233
The decision was made
by the Lord Advocate.
Things have escalated.

13:06.367 --> 13:10.900
He wants this bomb work
out of a University lab
and into a government lab.

13:11.267 --> 13:12.433
All of us

13:12.567 --> 13:14.567
are subject to the directions of
the Lord Advocate,

13:14.700 --> 13:17.467
however loyal we may feel
to trusted colleagues.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.933
Where's the link
behind these bombs?

13:34.567 --> 13:35.933
Bomb number one.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.567
Pilates class.
Pilates is for women.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.667
We still don't know that bomb
wasn't aimed at Father Incuzi.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
And we may never.
But say it wasn't.

13:43.933 --> 13:46.800
I think it wasn't.
Pilates class is for "women."

13:46.933 --> 13:50.133
-There were three men
in that class.
-I know.

13:50.267 --> 13:53.600
Bomb number two. Nail bar.
Nail bars are for women.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.200
One of the victims was a man.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.500
Aye. Bomb number three
that didn't go off.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.700
Boxing club, gym, whatever.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.667
For guys who get the women.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.900
Mezcal bar, for women and guys
who are getting it on
and getting it sexually.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.400
Well, that's maybe the logic.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.633
-Are INCELs classified
as terrorist threats?
-No.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.433
Not in the States, either.

14:13.567 --> 14:17.367
Even though people
are killed there in
INCEL-motivated attacks.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.967
-Bomb attacks?
-No, guns usually. Sometimes,
a vehicle uses a weapon.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.600
How big is the INCEL community?

14:23.733 --> 14:25.567
By the reckon of it,
10,000 in the UK.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.167
Thousands more worldwide.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.633
Just guy's blowing off steam,
really.

14:28.767 --> 14:31.067
Then, there's a smaller,
extreme faction.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.533
But they intermingle.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.933
So, following your line, Neil,
who do we need to protect
most urgently?

14:37.067 --> 14:38.533
Who's the next target?

14:38.667 --> 14:40.933
If you hate
sexually active women
and you want to hurt them

14:41.067 --> 14:43.400
and you hate sexually active men
and you want to hurt them,

14:43.533 --> 14:45.200
that's most of the population.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.367
That's why folk are scared.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.300
I mean, now that the gamers
are out of the picture there's
no pattern for folk to follow.

14:50.433 --> 14:52.800
Everybody's just thinking,
"It could be me next."

14:53.467 --> 14:54.500
It could.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.667
Is it for a special occasion?

15:23.567 --> 15:24.567
Yeah.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.533
Sorry.

15:33.567 --> 15:34.500
I'm still a bit...

15:34.633 --> 15:36.333
Aye. Of course, you are.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.633
On you go.

15:39.767 --> 15:40.967
Who were you with, Jack?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.167
Last I caught Gina.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.533
Gina, who?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.867
No clue.
First time I'd met her.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.567
So, it's just you and Gina.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.500
No.

15:52.633 --> 15:56.900
Thought I was with a girl called
Suzy before that,
but... disaster.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.467
We get short with each other
after 20 minutes, and I...

16:00.433 --> 16:02.067
Hooked up with Gina.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.467
-This is on your phone?
This is all a dating app...
-Aye.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.367
Did you see anything unusual
before the explosion?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.600
There was a guy.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.233
He ran past us
like a bat out of hell.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.133
Can you describe him?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.233
No.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.200
No, not really.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.933
White shirt?

16:35.067 --> 16:36.500
Aye. Him.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.900
Excuse me, excuse me.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.300
You forgot your bag.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.167
-Oh, thank you.
What a numpty.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.933
You're lucky it's me.
My manager would have called
the bomb squad.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.767
Did you know?

17:09.900 --> 17:11.633
They called me after you left.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.767
Great, and that's the first
you heard of it.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.300
Yeah.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.533
That's Ian. Ian Duffy.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.767
Is he okay? Where is he?

17:27.067 --> 17:28.500
We don't know where he is.

17:28.633 --> 17:31.133
-Did he not make it?
-Make it? Where?

17:31.967 --> 17:33.067
Reykjavik.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.700
Studies on decomposition
in water in the past

17:43.833 --> 17:46.967
have separated fresh water
from salt water.

17:47.100 --> 17:52.667
In Dundee's River Tay we have
not salt water or fresh water
but briny, tidal water.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.067
It's provided unique conditions
for my study.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.900
It's provided unique
conditions for my study.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.333
I don't think so.

18:03.467 --> 18:06.633
Ian Duffy ran out of Mezcal bar
to catch a flight to Reykjavik

18:06.767 --> 18:10.400
for a stag do where he steeped
himself in vodka ever since.
So he says.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.433
Well, get him back
and interview him.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.500
We're liaising
with Interpol and we're
looking at anything

18:14.633 --> 18:18.300
that might link Duffy
to black pill or INCEL thinking.

18:18.433 --> 18:20.467
Any progress
with the IP address?

18:20.600 --> 18:24.767
The IP address that visited
the site when the GIF was posted
is in New York City.

18:24.900 --> 18:28.667
It's a VPN company.
So, it could be anywhere.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.200
Someone's hiding behind it.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.567
We've got our hands on
the food order numbers

18:32.700 --> 18:35.367
that all three
food delivery companies,
not just Dundee's,

18:35.500 --> 18:37.200
picked up from Mezcal
on the night.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.067
We can trace them back to
each delivery rider's phone.

18:40.167 --> 18:44.600
And food order number 2442
was the last one in
before the bomb went off.

18:44.733 --> 18:47.567
The fingerprint
Professor Gordon identified
on the Mezcal bomb

18:47.700 --> 18:49.433
is a beauty
according to the lab.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.433
But no possible candidates
were found on the database

18:53.067 --> 18:54.133
Shame.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.667
So, I talked to
the Student Union President.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.967
He says the Physics department
has a tough culture,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.100
which doesn't work for everyone

19:05.233 --> 19:06.700
and sensitive students struggle.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.233
I talked to Polly in the shop.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.067
She knew you and she used
the word "sensitive" about him.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.433
She said he used to
come in often and then
she heard he withdrew.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.400
It's like I'm you.

19:16.533 --> 19:19.100
-I wouldn't recommend it.
-Why? What's up?

19:19.233 --> 19:22.567
SO15 pulled the bomb work
back to Porton.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.467
-It happens. It's normal.
You just have to let it go.
-Yeah.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.400
Come on, Sarah,
it's not personal.

19:28.533 --> 19:29.633
No.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.667
I'm in love with Sarah Gordon.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.133
I knew it.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.167
You wouldn't have it
but I knew it.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.700
You should have seen
yourself today, Neil,
when she got the push.

19:57.833 --> 20:03.133
You looked like you wanted
to just run after her and scoop
her up on your white horse.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.700
Couldn't even hide it.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.467
I was sitting in front of you.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.633
I'm so sorry.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.367
I don't know what to say
and I don't know what to do.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.667
-You pack a bag is what you do.
-Please, Azra, I want to talk.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.767
You pack a bag and you get out.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.567
-Azra.
-You grow a pair of balls
is what you do.

20:20.700 --> 20:25.100
Don't ask me what to do.
Be a man, you stupid man.
Get out!

20:25.233 --> 20:26.967
-I want to talk.
-I don't!

20:27.100 --> 20:28.200
I want you out!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.833
Have you shagged her yet?

20:40.900 --> 20:41.900
No.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.233
What a loser.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.533
Shall I come pick you up?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.700
-What?
-What good will that do?

20:56.467 --> 20:58.000
See if you get a cab.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.167
I know what you've done, Sarah.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.533
What have I done?

21:03.667 --> 21:05.967
You've looked
in the kitchen diary
and not in the phone diary.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.733
I'm coming home tomorrow.

21:23.633 --> 21:25.933
You never forgave me, did you?

21:26.067 --> 21:29.400
My darling, I tried.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.433
Should have had the guts
to leave me back then.

21:32.567 --> 21:34.367
I thought we could weather it.

21:34.967 --> 21:36.367
Been over for years.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.467
Well,
I don't agree with that.

21:45.667 --> 21:49.133
But, no. We never got back
to where we were.

21:53.367 --> 21:55.100
You can't judge me now.

21:55.233 --> 21:58.533
You know what it feels like
to fall in love with someone
and cause pain.

21:58.667 --> 22:01.300
Doesn't make me a bad person
that I did that.

22:01.433 --> 22:02.967
I never judged that.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.233
What got me

22:06.367 --> 22:08.733
was that you hid it
from me as long as you did.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.133
And that I found out about it
the way that I did.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.367
We'll both be happier.

22:25.467 --> 22:26.700
-Oh.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.400
Hi.

23:13.533 --> 23:15.100
Can you meet me for a drink?

23:15.700 --> 23:17.067
No.

23:17.167 --> 23:18.100
Okay.

23:18.233 --> 23:19.400
Sorry.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.400
No, no problem.

23:23.833 --> 23:24.867
Can you come over?

23:25.467 --> 23:26.500
Yes.

23:26.633 --> 23:29.067
Are you at sea farm or...

23:29.167 --> 23:30.267
I'm at home.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.500
Okay, uh... Sure.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.400
Well...

23:37.533 --> 23:39.367
You'll have to tell me
where you live.

23:53.133 --> 23:55.400
-Hey! Hey!

23:56.900 --> 23:58.900
You think that's funny? Eh?

23:59.067 --> 24:00.567
There's bombs going off
all over the city,

24:00.700 --> 24:01.933
people are scared
to leave their houses.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.967
There's nothing funny about it.
You understand?

24:13.667 --> 24:16.433
-Are you friendly
with your neighbours?
-Why?

24:16.567 --> 24:19.267
I just went
over the top with a kid
who was throwing fireworks.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.067
Oh, good for you. Come in.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.233
I didn't realise
how wound up I was.

24:30.767 --> 24:31.833
Who are they for?

24:31.967 --> 24:34.567
For you, being treated
atrociously today.

24:35.267 --> 24:36.700
How lovely.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.300
If you like the smell of petrol.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.233
I do.
So, that's absolutely perfect.

24:42.300 --> 24:45.200
Fiscal said it was
political, basically.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.500
Sending everything back
to Porton Down.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.367
It's no reflection
on your work at all.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.767
They're panicking, basically.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.700
I say that like I'm not.
God knows I'm panicking, too.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.400
Of course you are.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.300
It's terrifying knowing
the next bomb
could go off any minute.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.667
That's why I hate
being stood down.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.300
Not because they did it
in such a shitty way,

25:04.433 --> 25:07.467
but because it means
there's nothing I can do.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.567
It wasn't shitty.
It was brutal.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.667
You know who I feel
really let down by is Finn.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.367
When I got back to the lab,
he was already
packing up the productions,

25:16.500 --> 25:19.533
but he pretended he hadn't known
before I did.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.167
He's such a shitty liar.

25:22.833 --> 25:23.900
Spineless.

25:43.867 --> 25:44.867
Don't.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.067
-Where's your family?
-Away.

26:29.667 --> 26:32.133
That was a good one,
his first term.

26:32.267 --> 26:35.367
Yeah. But I had
no concerns about him.

26:35.500 --> 26:40.433
And then, by the end
of his first year his,
his grades were slipping.

26:40.567 --> 26:44.533
And then by the second year,
he was failing.

26:44.667 --> 26:45.900
Right.

26:46.067 --> 26:48.800
I mean, students don't just fail
for no reason, right?

26:48.933 --> 26:51.433
You know, just fail
for the hell of it.

26:51.567 --> 26:53.433
Anyway...

26:53.567 --> 26:56.067
Euan, he... He stopped
coming in to talk to me.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.100
But you know,
whenever I'd run into him,

26:59.233 --> 27:01.667
he seemed very despondent.

27:02.267 --> 27:03.467
So I flagged it

27:03.600 --> 27:05.567
to the Vice Dean
of Teaching and Learning.

27:05.700 --> 27:08.867
I said I've got concerns
about Euan McMillan.

27:09.067 --> 27:10.333
I'm worried about
his mental state.

27:10.467 --> 27:12.067
This was email or face-to-face?

27:12.167 --> 27:13.300
Face-to-face.

27:13.433 --> 27:14.867
Nothing happened.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.300
And so I did put in an email.

27:17.433 --> 27:19.267
Three, in fact.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.400
Nothing.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.467
By the time I escalated things,
it was too late.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.900
Euan had dropped out.

27:27.067 --> 27:29.100
He wants to withdraw, there's...

27:29.233 --> 27:31.467
Frustratingly little
you can do to help.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.233
Sure.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.900
Next I heard about him
was in the papers this week.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.733
God, I should have
done more.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.067
We all should.

27:43.900 --> 27:44.933
Yeah.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.567
How did you escalate things?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.100
Well, I wrote to the dean.

27:54.767 --> 27:56.733
I should feel bad, but I don't.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.667
I feel clear.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.800
I feel wonderful.

28:02.433 --> 28:03.500
Good.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.133
I feel wonderful, too.

28:07.267 --> 28:09.600
How come you smell so good?

28:09.733 --> 28:11.300
You smell like
you've burned petrol.

28:11.433 --> 28:14.500
Come on, woman.
It's not possible for a person

28:14.633 --> 28:16.433
-to smell better than petrol.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.600
I am so hungry. Are you?

28:19.733 --> 28:21.567
I think I want a drink as well.

28:29.067 --> 28:30.500
Where do you stand on cheese?

28:32.933 --> 28:33.967
Sarah.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.467
Neil.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.800
Azra knows I'm in love with you.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.767
How?

28:47.900 --> 28:48.900
I told her.

28:49.967 --> 28:52.667
-Why?
-It's the truth.

28:53.067 --> 28:54.433
But...

28:54.567 --> 28:56.567
Oh, God.
What did she say?

28:57.133 --> 28:58.233
That she knew.

28:59.633 --> 29:01.933
And that I should go.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.600
Oh, Neil.

29:04.733 --> 29:06.400
-What will you do?
-Well...

29:07.233 --> 29:08.200
I've left.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.367
I want to be with you.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.233
I want to spend
my life with you.

29:16.367 --> 29:18.467
Azra said herself,
we've been finished for years.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.367
You need to slow down.
You're scaring me.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.833
-She thinks we'll be happy.
-Azra thinks we'll be happier?

29:22.967 --> 29:25.500
-No, she thinks...
-When did you and Azra
have this heart-to-heart

29:25.633 --> 29:28.233
where the two of you decided
that you should spend
your life with me?

29:28.367 --> 29:30.433
-Tonight, but that's not...
-Why didn't you tell me before?

29:30.567 --> 29:32.367
-I just told you now.
-Before we...

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
I never would have...

29:35.900 --> 29:38.900
I'm not leaving Campbell,
let's just get that straight.

29:39.067 --> 29:40.367
This wasn't about forever.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.900
-This was just...
-What?

29:42.533 --> 29:43.900
An experiment?

29:44.067 --> 29:45.633
You're getting your rocks off
for one night only

29:45.767 --> 29:46.967
-and I'm the guinea pig?
-No.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.300
You asked me
to your empty house.

29:49.433 --> 29:51.067
Oh, don't you dare! Come on.

29:51.133 --> 29:53.733
And that's fine.
But what's not fine
is me wanting more.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.233
That's messed up.

29:55.367 --> 29:57.833
You're not the one
that got used here, Sarah.
I did.

29:57.967 --> 29:59.200
That is rubbish!

29:59.333 --> 30:01.000
You had me
under false pretences.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.867
I thought this was two people
in the moment having
some joy for once!

30:05.000 --> 30:06.333
But you had to take over.

30:06.467 --> 30:08.567
You had to commandeer it.
You've ruined it.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.900
I wish it never happened.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.667
Ian Duffy is being flown
home from Reykjavik.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.933
The Chief Super wants
the anxiety about him
laid to rest.

30:54.067 --> 30:55.900
Can you be back here
in an hour to interview?

30:56.033 --> 30:57.467
-Yes, boss.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.167
Second floor.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.433
-Azra.
-Hi.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.533
-Hello.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.100
-Going down.
-Hi.

31:04.233 --> 31:06.567
-Hi.
-AUTOMATED VOICE:
Doors closing.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.200
Order 2442.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.333
We got through to the guy
who corresponds
with the login details,

31:12.467 --> 31:15.333
expecting we'd have to trace
who he subbed it to.

31:15.467 --> 31:16.867
He sold it.

31:17.067 --> 31:19.733
He sold his Dundee's login
for 200 quid online.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.767
Who'd he sell it to?

31:21.900 --> 31:23.867
We don't know
that yet, obviously.

31:25.733 --> 31:26.733
Where are you staying?

31:27.267 --> 31:28.367
My sister's.

31:30.433 --> 31:31.867
First floor.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.900
-Going down.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.600
Take your time, Holly.

31:37.733 --> 31:39.833
I was waiting for a guy
called Elliott.

31:39.967 --> 31:43.567
I was fairly near the door,
so I'd know him from
his photo when he came in.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.500
His photo on the dating app?

31:45.633 --> 31:46.700
Uh-huh.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.067
I was starting to think
he'd bolted.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.800
And that pissed me off.

31:50.933 --> 31:54.600
'Cause he was the one
that was keen.

31:54.733 --> 31:57.833
And I thought, I'll give this
a chance for five more minutes.

31:57.967 --> 31:59.467
And then...

31:59.600 --> 32:02.533
How was he keen, this guy?

32:02.667 --> 32:05.733
I was fine texting,
but he pushed me.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.867
We made a date,
but he wanted sooner.

32:10.067 --> 32:11.067
Said he couldn't wait.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.667
And who suggested the Mezcal?

32:12.800 --> 32:13.967
He did.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.433
Holly, could you
show me his photo?

32:18.567 --> 32:19.600
Mmm.

32:19.733 --> 32:21.833
-You need to hold that.
-Yeah.

32:27.633 --> 32:29.467
It's pretty obvious
why I picked him.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.267
Who did you reject?

32:33.400 --> 32:36.800
-Sorry?
-Well, can you show us photos
of guys who you rejected?

32:38.233 --> 32:39.933
The old dean or the new dean?

32:40.067 --> 32:43.533
He forwarded all the emails
saying how worried he was
about Euan McMillan,

32:43.667 --> 32:45.767
which the vice dean
ignored to the old dean.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.267
-When?
-Not long before
the old dean left

32:48.400 --> 32:50.800
and the new dean started.
She must know about it.

32:50.933 --> 32:52.700
She's covering something up.
I was right.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.267
Stop, This is hypothetical.
It's all hearsay,

32:55.400 --> 32:58.267
and it has huge
reputation-damaging
possibilities.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.133
If a student wound up dead
because the school of science
failed him,

33:01.267 --> 33:02.400
I am not going to drop it.

33:02.533 --> 33:03.667
I'm not telling you to drop it.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.167
But if you're going to go
looking into the dean,

33:05.300 --> 33:07.900
who you've already antagonised,
you need to make very sure

33:08.067 --> 33:12.067
of where people's loyalties lie
before you go around
asking questions. I mean it.

33:12.133 --> 33:13.500
You know who
your secret weapon is.

33:14.533 --> 33:16.067
Janine.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.500
Oh, I talked to Erika
about gossiping to Janine,
and I was tough.

33:19.633 --> 33:21.167
It worked. We're back on track.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.867
Good.

33:23.867 --> 33:25.233
What's going on with you?

33:26.400 --> 33:27.900
Handing over the bomb work.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.600
Right.

33:30.733 --> 33:33.133
I saw them pack up
all the productions
to drive them down to Hampshire.

33:33.267 --> 33:34.467
Wiltshire.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.133
Porton Down's in Wiltshire.

33:36.267 --> 33:37.733
Okay.

33:37.867 --> 33:39.333
I'm going to go talk to Janine.

33:41.067 --> 33:42.967
I've made the biggest mistake
of my life.

33:44.700 --> 33:45.933
With the bomb work?

33:46.867 --> 33:48.500
No.

33:49.267 --> 33:50.333
With Neil.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.833
You passed this lot over
this week?

33:57.333 --> 33:58.333
Yeah.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.500
Slow down.

34:08.533 --> 34:09.667
Can you go back?

34:10.067 --> 34:11.067
Hmm.

34:12.067 --> 34:13.067
Stop.

34:16.067 --> 34:19.867
We were looking at food pickups
from the Mezcal to clarify
timings of the bomb.

34:20.067 --> 34:21.067
Did you see any?

34:21.867 --> 34:23.067
Any what?

34:23.200 --> 34:24.933
Couriers.
Food delivery couriers.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.333
A food guy came in.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.467
He winked at me.

34:32.933 --> 34:33.900
This guy?

34:35.600 --> 34:36.900
I don't know.

34:37.067 --> 34:39.233
Holly, would you be prepared
to let us have your phone?

34:44.067 --> 34:47.267
-I've always been good.
-I know.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.967
I always wondered
what it'd be like
not to be good.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.233
Now I know it's appalling.

34:52.367 --> 34:53.800
Why did I do it?

34:53.933 --> 34:56.333
You didn't kill anyone.
It's okay.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.067
It's not okay.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.533
Okay.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.567
Subject closed, okay?

35:03.233 --> 35:04.233
For good.

35:08.967 --> 35:10.267
Just one thing.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.367
Before it all went terrible
with Neil, was it fun?

35:18.467 --> 35:20.500
Does Neil think
you're happy at home?

35:21.567 --> 35:23.100
I am happy at home.

35:26.367 --> 35:28.433
I think you make
a good show of it.

35:33.067 --> 35:34.900
Jesus Christ, Safi.
Thank God for you.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.100
I would have missed it.
He's not just
a delivery driver.

35:37.233 --> 35:38.867
-He only works for Dundee Eats.
-He does.

35:39.067 --> 35:42.700
Sam... Sam Kilty.

35:54.633 --> 35:57.167
Phone number he gave us
when we interviewed him is dead.

35:57.300 --> 36:00.400
There's no Sam Kilty registered
at the address he gave us.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.500
Dundee Eats
have the same address.

36:02.633 --> 36:04.600
Ken's going to see it
if it's a previous address.

36:04.733 --> 36:05.900
And if they know him.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.900
Elliott is a model.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.933
We did a reverse image search.

36:11.067 --> 36:13.700
His real name is Jonah Swift
He's based in Manchester.

36:13.833 --> 36:18.067
That photo. One company
has exclusive use
for promotional material.

36:18.133 --> 36:21.067
A group of plastic
surgery clinics called
Leda Aesthetics.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.233
There's one in Dundee.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.767
Submit a data protection form.
Now.

36:29.433 --> 36:32.533
Erm, Professor Gordon.
Don't know if you had a chance

36:32.667 --> 36:34.400
to read the email
I sent this morning?

36:34.533 --> 36:35.867
No. What's it about?

36:36.067 --> 36:38.067
It's a complaint
about Professor Torrance.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.267
-There's a video attached.
-Um...

36:42.700 --> 36:43.800
Come into my office.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.867
What are the grounds
for complaint?

36:52.067 --> 36:54.500
She presented my work
without due acknowledgment.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.367
I'm very surprised to hear that.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.233
I'm really unhappy about it.

37:01.133 --> 37:03.433
Have a seat, Erika.
Talk to me.

37:03.567 --> 37:04.567
No, thanks.

37:05.533 --> 37:08.500
I just wanted to let you know

37:08.633 --> 37:11.100
that, um,
after I sent it to you

37:11.567 --> 37:13.267
I, um...

37:13.400 --> 37:15.067
also sent it to the dean.

37:17.467 --> 37:20.667
It's provided unique conditions
for my study.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.967
I was surprised, too,
when I saw this result.

37:24.100 --> 37:28.167
The adipocere was clearing
from the skeleton faster
than I expected.

37:28.300 --> 37:32.067
My data would indicate,
that was what we found
in my data.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.967
Well, because of my study.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.067
Is that Erika's data?

37:38.167 --> 37:40.700
No, I would never, I mean...

37:41.367 --> 37:42.933
Clearly I did.

37:43.067 --> 37:45.167
-But I can't believe I did that.
-What's going on here?

37:45.300 --> 37:47.367
You and Erika
were thick as thieves.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.633
Then you changed your tune.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.467
This morning,
you said you were back on track.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.267
Now she's gone nuclear. Why?

37:53.533 --> 37:54.900
How could I have done that?

37:56.167 --> 37:59.067
It happens.
It shouldn't, but it does.

37:59.667 --> 38:00.800
I've done it.

38:00.933 --> 38:02.800
You know, you're in a room
full of peers,

38:02.933 --> 38:05.233
impostor syndrome kicks in
and you want to impress.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.333
You don't acknowledge
as you should.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.867
It's a bad mistake
and you need to apologise.

38:10.067 --> 38:12.367
But I would expect Erika
to pull you up in a bit,

38:12.500 --> 38:15.233
talk to you about it,
not email me
and include the dean.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.500
Why has she gone so crazy?

38:17.633 --> 38:20.067
-I don't know.
-You must know.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.733
What, what's going on
between you?

38:21.867 --> 38:23.067
Nothing.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.733
The overnight at Lockley

38:34.867 --> 38:36.433
when Pia broke up with me...

38:37.633 --> 38:38.700
I handled it.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.800
But after...

38:45.200 --> 38:47.100
I had a panic attack.

38:48.933 --> 38:50.400
I have panic attacks.

38:50.533 --> 38:51.867
Since when?

38:52.067 --> 38:53.333
Forever.

38:53.467 --> 38:56.633
-Why did you never tell me?
-I'm a very private person.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.067
I know how to deal with it.
I... I take a pill.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.767
And if it happens at night,
I take one and a half.
It knocks me out.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.733
In the morning, I'm fine. So...

39:09.900 --> 39:11.767
Erika...

39:11.900 --> 39:16.233
Erika woke up in the night
with flashbacks
and she knocked on my door.

39:16.367 --> 39:19.600
I was out cold,
so she freaked out.
She got the concierge.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.400
They...

39:21.533 --> 39:24.900
They came into my room
and they were demanding
how many pills I'd taken.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.533
I was in my shirt and underwear.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.200
And the concierge left.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.067
Erika stayed.

39:33.900 --> 39:34.900
And...

39:35.567 --> 39:36.667
What happened?

39:36.800 --> 39:38.467
I don't remember.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.467
I don't remember
what I did, or said,
or how long she stayed.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.200
All I know is I took
more pills than usual,

39:44.333 --> 39:46.800
I drank more than usual,
so I would have been...

39:48.067 --> 39:51.433
disinhibited, and she was there.

39:51.567 --> 39:53.733
-And you hate that.
-I hate that!

39:53.867 --> 39:56.367
Well... It's not her fault
she was there.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.633
I didn't say it was.

39:57.767 --> 39:58.833
Did you talk about it?

39:58.967 --> 40:00.467
No, She tried to.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.333
She tried to comfort me
the next day.

40:03.467 --> 40:06.133
She offered to be
my sounding board
about my breakup with Pia.

40:06.267 --> 40:07.400
And what did you say?

40:07.533 --> 40:09.167
Nothing. I shut it down.

40:09.300 --> 40:13.433
I backed off.
I've kept backing off. But she,
and now she's done this.

40:13.567 --> 40:15.067
You have to talk.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.700
Okay, if you pretend
difficult things
aren't happening,

40:17.833 --> 40:20.567
they just get worse and worse.
They just get more inflamed.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.200
Students need to be able
to talk to us.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.800
You having panic attacks
isn't your fault.

40:25.933 --> 40:27.967
Her trying to comfort you
is kind, but you not dealing

40:28.100 --> 40:30.200
with the situation
is a disaster.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.433
That's why Erika's gone nuclear
and involved the dean

40:32.567 --> 40:35.000
who you're already at war with,
thanks to your little speech.

40:35.133 --> 40:38.400
You don't talk when you should,
and then you shoot your
mouth off when you shouldn't.

40:38.533 --> 40:41.633
Honest to God, Kathy,
you're such
a useless communicator!

40:41.767 --> 40:44.200
Okay, I, I made mistakes.

40:44.333 --> 40:47.100
I accept that
and I will deal with them.
But...

40:48.600 --> 40:50.700
Please, especially today, Sarah.

40:50.833 --> 40:53.600
Don't talk to me like
you're someone who
doesn't make mistakes.

41:03.833 --> 41:05.567
Sam Kilty has been here.

41:05.700 --> 41:06.967
He's on their books.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.633
We got an address for him.

41:14.567 --> 41:18.133
The foreign address
they gave us is at
his old place in Trottick.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.333
Dating from when?

41:19.467 --> 41:20.500
A year ago.

41:22.267 --> 41:24.767
The address the clinic
gave us for him
is in Muirhead.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.400
When from?

41:26.533 --> 41:29.333
A year ago. You try yours,
we'll try ours.

41:29.467 --> 41:30.533
Okay, boss.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.167
-Bye.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.300
Don't answer it.

41:35.433 --> 41:37.067
He's dragging us back
to speak to Ian Duffy.
It's a stupid idea.

41:37.133 --> 41:38.133
This is a better one.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.067
Fucking hell.

41:57.467 --> 41:58.967
Sam Kilty live here?

41:59.100 --> 42:00.633
I think he does.

42:00.767 --> 42:02.233
Is there a Sam Kilty here?

42:02.367 --> 42:03.800
There's a "Sam" somebody.

42:03.933 --> 42:06.200
-Which room?
-Upstairs, blue door.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.333
-He's out though.
-Where'd he go?

42:08.467 --> 42:09.433
I don't know.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.200
Sarah.

43:25.533 --> 43:26.633
I need you.
