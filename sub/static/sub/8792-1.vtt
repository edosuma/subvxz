00:31.707 --> 00:34.073
<i>All drivers to your cars, please.</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:36.905
<i>All drivers to your cars.</i>

01:20.956 --> 01:23.447
- Distracted?
- No, that's not exactly right.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.287
Your son seems to be interested
in only one thing.

01:26.461 --> 01:30.420
All he talks about, all he seems
capable of thinking about...

01:30.599 --> 01:31.998
...is automobile racing.

01:32.167 --> 01:35.068
Well, you know,
his father designs racing cars.

01:35.237 --> 01:36.568
And where is your husband?

01:37.039 --> 01:40.338
Working. He couldn't be here.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.070
Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
very far from the tree.

01:45.047 --> 01:46.412
Is your husband's name Rex?

01:46.582 --> 01:49.483
No, that's his older brother, Rex. Why?

01:51.520 --> 01:54.512
This is the test he turned in last week.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.482
Hm.

02:54.516 --> 02:56.040
All right, pencils down.

02:56.218 --> 02:59.654
Take your answer sheets, place it
into the first part of your booklet...

02:59.821 --> 03:02.722
...pack up your things
and bring your... to my desk.

03:03.525 --> 03:04.822
Speed Racer, slow down!

03:19.708 --> 03:20.970
Take it you're ready to go?

03:27.015 --> 03:29.279
- How was school?
- Fine.

03:29.451 --> 03:31.544
Are you going to the track?
Mom said you were.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.689
You don't have to drop me off.
I could just go with you.

03:34.856 --> 03:36.255
- No way.
- Oh, come on.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.985
Take me with you. Come on, please.

03:39.161 --> 03:41.129
I can't, Speed.

03:41.296 --> 03:43.730
- Pops would kill me.
- He doesn't have to know.

03:44.132 --> 03:46.692
I won't say anything. Nobody will know.

03:46.868 --> 03:53.034
Come on, please, Rex.
Please, please, please.

03:57.679 --> 03:58.907
Are you wearing the socks?

04:00.348 --> 04:01.372
Hm? Hm?

04:02.884 --> 04:05.614
Okay. But if you roll us again,
this'll be the last time.

04:06.488 --> 04:07.546
Deal?

04:07.723 --> 04:09.156
<i>Deal.</i>

04:28.410 --> 04:30.878
Oh, yeah!

04:31.813 --> 04:33.144
Come on!

04:33.315 --> 04:35.749
Yee-haw!

04:36.218 --> 04:40.154
You feel that shimmy? It's your hind legs
trying to outrun your front.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.482
What do I do?

04:41.656 --> 04:44.181
You stop steering and you start driving.

04:47.062 --> 04:49.326
This ain't no dead piece of metal.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.467
A car is a living, breathing thing, all right?
She's alive.

04:54.469 --> 04:58.428
You can feel her talking to you, telling you
what she wants, what she needs. Listen.

05:00.375 --> 05:03.242
Close your eyes and listen.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.314
They say that Ben Burns drove the final lap
of the Vanderbilt Cup with his eyes closed.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.618
- No way!
- No?

05:11.787 --> 05:15.052
Maybe you just can't hear it, then.
Ought to start hitting those books.

05:15.223 --> 05:18.488
- No, I hear it!
- Oh, is that so, Mr. Burns?

05:18.660 --> 05:21.561
All right.
Tell me when to punch it for the jump.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.697
- Now?
- Uh-uh.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.332
Now!

05:58.200 --> 06:01.101
Local fan favorite Speed Racer
is gobbling up this track.

06:08.243 --> 06:12.771
Let us hope he does not make
the same mistakes that his brother made.

06:21.122 --> 06:24.523
Heads up, Speed. Seven o'clock.
I got Snake drafting Pitter-Pat.

06:24.693 --> 06:26.422
I got him.

06:30.298 --> 06:32.994
I figure he'll slingshot after you
in the next turn.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.201
I'm ready.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.580
Great move, Speed!

06:59.027 --> 07:01.359
All right, watch out
for the dog balls coming up.

07:01.529 --> 07:02.894
You may wanna ease off a little.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.959
Not this time, Sparky.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.085
Holy cannoli, Speed.

07:27.255 --> 07:29.951
<i>- You know who you're racing?
- Yeah.</i>

07:49.577 --> 07:51.772
Rex is gonna win it, ain't he, Pops?

07:52.647 --> 07:54.638
Nobody's gonna catch him.
He's gonna win it.

07:54.816 --> 07:57.808
He's gonna set the course record.
Nobody's gonna stop him.

07:57.986 --> 08:00.921
- Quiet. There's still a lot of race to go.
- No way. It's over.

08:01.089 --> 08:05.355
My brother's the best racer in the world.
Everyone else is running for second.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.824
Yeah!

08:09.764 --> 08:11.322
I told you to take him out!

08:11.499 --> 08:14.593
We're trying, sir, we're trying,
but he's just too fast.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.041
<i>It's unbelievable, folks!</i>

08:27.749 --> 08:31.276
No one has seen moves like this since that
remarkable night eight years ago.

08:31.453 --> 08:33.683
There's no doubt in my mind.
He's gunning for the record.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.721
He is not alone out there,
he is chasing someone.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.053
He is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer.

08:47.769 --> 08:51.364
Jeepers, he could do it, Pops.
He could really do it.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.939
What if he does it?
What if he does it, Pops?

08:55.677 --> 08:58.407
I don't know if I can watch this.

09:23.805 --> 09:26.535
There's that Speed Racer.

09:26.708 --> 09:30.075
My daddy told me that his daddy used to
work for the Mishida Motorwerks...

09:30.545 --> 09:32.069
...but he quit.

09:32.247 --> 09:35.273
My daddy told me that it was
a completely crazy thing to do.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.315
He says the whole family is crazy.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.384
Speed's not crazy.

09:39.554 --> 09:40.953
No. He's just dumb.

09:41.256 --> 09:43.656
Probably the dumbest kid in the class.

09:43.825 --> 09:46.726
Mrs. Waterstraat had me
alphabetize the IRB tests...

09:47.162 --> 09:50.063
...and you wouldn't believe
what the retard did.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.201
Speed!

10:09.184 --> 10:10.913
Speed!

10:12.253 --> 10:14.278
Are you all right?

10:17.959 --> 10:19.449
Who are you?

10:19.794 --> 10:22.922
I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.

10:23.198 --> 10:25.029
Oh, yeah.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.891
Hey, you wanna see my car collection?

10:28.603 --> 10:30.662
I'd love to.

10:39.114 --> 10:40.206
Hey, Rex. Hey, Pops.

10:40.381 --> 10:42.349
- Hey, Speedy.
- Who's your friend?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.314
Her name's Trixie. She's in my class.

10:44.486 --> 10:46.750
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you, young lady.

10:46.921 --> 10:50.948
Hey, Pops, a guy told me to
give this to you. Says he was a big fan.

10:51.292 --> 10:53.192
Oh. A fan, is it?

10:53.595 --> 10:56.962
Well, it's not every day we get people
with such good taste around here.

10:57.132 --> 11:00.158
- Where is he?
- He was in a hurry, driving a '68 Fendersin.

11:00.435 --> 11:02.835
- Sweet set of wheels.
- Let me see that.

11:15.817 --> 11:18.183
Cool beans.

11:26.461 --> 11:30.488
No one from these parts will ever forget
the tragic story of Rex Racer.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.132
He nearly ruined racing.

11:35.303 --> 11:38.067
One of the bravest men
to ever drive a racecar.

11:42.277 --> 11:44.177
<i>Can I come with you, Rex?</i>

11:45.980 --> 11:47.971
Not this time, Speedy.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.343
When are you coming back?

11:52.487 --> 11:55.115
I don't know. I don't know.

11:59.127 --> 12:01.789
Hey, there's something
I want you to have.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.429
But the Mach 5's your car.

12:06.901 --> 12:08.493
Not anymore.

12:10.872 --> 12:13.136
Look, Speed...

12:16.678 --> 12:20.205
...one day, people might
say things about me.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.345
But no matter what they say...

12:23.518 --> 12:24.917
...I just...

12:25.720 --> 12:28.120
Look, I hope you never believe them.

12:29.424 --> 12:30.686
I won't.

12:33.228 --> 12:34.525
Come here.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.660
So you're quitting?

12:44.405 --> 12:45.997
I have to.

12:46.708 --> 12:50.769
No, you don't. This is a choice.
You're selling out.

12:51.446 --> 12:53.710
Turning your back
on everything we built here.

12:53.881 --> 12:55.815
I'm done arguing with you, Pops.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.645
Don't you turn your back on me.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.885
You can't tell me what to do.
It's my life to live.

13:03.057 --> 13:05.992
You walk out that door now,
you better not ever come back.

13:19.941 --> 13:22.739
<i>Rex Racer,
driving the black-and-red Uniron car...</i>

13:22.910 --> 13:25.674
<i>... got into a tangle with Richenbach,
who was favored to win.</i>

13:25.847 --> 13:28.008
<i>That was no tangle.
He took Richenbach out.</i>

13:28.182 --> 13:29.706
<i>Well, we don't know that...</i>

13:29.884 --> 13:31.909
<i>... but I imagine the WRL
will be reviewing this crash.</i>

13:32.086 --> 13:34.281
<i>That's the third DNF crash
Racer's been in.</i>

13:34.455 --> 13:36.923
<i>- Turn it off, Speed.
- They ought to just suspend him.</i>

13:37.091 --> 13:39.525
I don't want you watching this anymore.

13:40.094 --> 13:44.258
The trial of Rex Racer shook the World
Racing League to its very foundation.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.696
Once a rat, always a rat...

13:46.868 --> 13:50.929
...and in my book,
Rex Racer's nothing but a rat.

13:51.105 --> 13:52.436
<i>Did you see that?</i>

13:52.607 --> 13:55.633
<i>That will definitely leave a mark.</i>

13:55.810 --> 13:58.370
<i>And Rex Racer nearly took
Yokima's head off with that jump.</i>

13:58.546 --> 14:00.446
<i>Hey, there is no doubt in my mind...</i>

14:00.615 --> 14:04.051
<i>... that Rex Racer is one of
the dirtiest drivers in the world.</i>

14:04.218 --> 14:07.278
For five years, Rex Racer took orders
from the criminal underworld.

14:14.329 --> 14:15.853
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

14:18.399 --> 14:20.959
No! You stop this!
You stop it right now!

14:21.135 --> 14:22.727
I just told him the truth!

14:22.904 --> 14:25.998
His crumbum brother doesn't belong
on a racetrack, he belongs in jail!

14:28.743 --> 14:32.338
The indictment brought down the
perennial racing powerhouse, Uniron.

14:32.513 --> 14:36.040
Uniron was linked to the notorious fixer,
Blackjack Benelli.

14:36.217 --> 14:37.582
Still in prison today...

14:37.752 --> 14:41.882
...Benelli was rumored to be
behind the Casa Cristo tragedy.

14:45.059 --> 14:48.324
<i>This is one of the worst crashes
I have ever s...</i>

14:49.764 --> 14:52.824
<i>How could this happen? This is terrible.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:54.524
<i>This is just terrible.</i>

14:55.870 --> 14:58.338
<i>And still no sign of driver Rex Racer.</i>

15:02.977 --> 15:04.740
Oh.

15:07.882 --> 15:09.315
I know.

15:18.993 --> 15:21.393
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

15:34.642 --> 15:35.666
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

15:40.481 --> 15:44.144
"Forget the past," he's saying.
"This is my night!"

15:56.097 --> 15:58.122
- He's coming hard.
- It's gonna be close!

16:16.851 --> 16:22.153
<i>Unbelievable!
A split second late. The record still stands.</i>

16:31.666 --> 16:33.600
Come on, let's go. Victory Lane.

16:33.768 --> 16:38.705
<i>Folks, I knew Rex Racer, and if he's up
there somewhere watching this race...</i>

16:38.873 --> 16:43.401
<i>... you can bet your ass
he's damn proud of his little brother.</i>

16:44.278 --> 16:48.305
<i>Pulling into
Victory Lane, the winner, Speed Racer!</i>

16:48.483 --> 16:50.781
He's going to be very good.

16:51.786 --> 16:54.550
No, he's going to be the best...

16:56.257 --> 16:59.124
...if they don't destroy him first.

17:35.897 --> 17:37.558
Hi-ya!

17:38.132 --> 17:40.498
KEN:

17:42.003 --> 17:43.027
Ha! Ha! Ha!

17:45.273 --> 17:48.071
Hey, hey! What are you two doing?

17:48.676 --> 17:49.700
Nothing.

17:49.877 --> 17:52.607
Was that the same nothing
that broke my last couch?

17:53.047 --> 17:55.538
No, that was a totally different nothing.

17:56.918 --> 17:57.976
Got it!

17:59.120 --> 18:00.314
<i>- Racer residence.
- Morning.</i>

18:00.488 --> 18:03.480
<i>- May I speak to Speed Racer?
- He's not interested.</i>

18:03.658 --> 18:04.784
Spritle?
- What?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.449
Was that for Speed?

18:06.627 --> 18:09.061
Yeah, but Speed
doesn't wanna talk to them.

18:09.230 --> 18:10.254
You don't know that.

18:10.431 --> 18:14.094
Sure, I do. Speed's gotta drive for Pops.
He's gotta.

18:14.268 --> 18:15.792
Well, that's for Speed to decide.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.096
Now get dressed.

18:17.271 --> 18:19.899
- Tell your father breakfast is ready.
- Ooh.

18:20.207 --> 18:21.902
"It was a virtuoso display of talent...

18:22.076 --> 18:24.704
...which has not been seen
since Racer the elder...

18:24.879 --> 18:26.608
...dropped jaws eight years ago.

18:26.781 --> 18:29.841
As we once again pull our collective
jaw up from the floor, we ask:

18:30.017 --> 18:33.509
- 'Will it be different or will tragedy...?"'
- That's enough.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.715
I can't believe there's not one mention
of Racer Motors in here.

18:37.892 --> 18:40.588
That's because the sponsors
control the media, Sparky.

18:40.761 --> 18:42.695
Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

18:42.863 --> 18:45.559
- Is Speed up yet?
- In spirit, anyway.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.262
Oh, thanks.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.460
- Hey, superstar.
- Hey, Trix.

18:49.804 --> 18:52.466
Have you seen the papers?
They're all in love with you.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.130
Really?

18:54.342 --> 18:58.335
Yeah. There seems to be a lot of speculation
about which team you'll sign with.

19:00.147 --> 19:01.444
Really?

19:03.651 --> 19:05.414
- What the...?
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

19:05.586 --> 19:09.454
Quick, Pops! The kitchen is the most
dangerous place in an earthquake.

19:10.791 --> 19:14.659
- Everybody, run for your life!
- Spritle, calm down!

19:24.438 --> 19:26.963
Mr. Racer, morning.

19:27.608 --> 19:28.632
What?

19:30.044 --> 19:33.104
Oh, um, may I?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.804
Oh!

19:38.953 --> 19:42.684
Mr. and Mrs. Racer,
I hope you will forgive this imposition.

19:42.857 --> 19:45.985
These are bluebells from Eden, Inc.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.392
I'm told they'll bloom at least three times,
each time a different color.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.361
And Mr. Racer, these are for you.

19:52.867 --> 19:56.803
Straight from the Isle of Kamut,
hand-rolled, premium blend.

19:56.971 --> 19:59.496
Thanks, but who are you?

20:00.474 --> 20:02.874
I am E.P. Arnold Royalton, Esquire...

20:03.044 --> 20:05.512
...president and chairman
of Royalton Industries.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.807
And it is my honor to meet you both.

20:09.116 --> 20:13.416
Oh, dear, I seem to have
interrupted your breakfast.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.418
Is that pancakes I smell?

20:16.691 --> 20:18.989
Oh, are you hungry, Mr. Royalton?

20:19.160 --> 20:22.459
A figure like mine requires
constant attention, Mrs. Racer.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.029
And do you like pancakes?

20:24.765 --> 20:27.233
When I was a child, we used to say:

20:31.939 --> 20:34.703
Pancakes are love.

20:38.412 --> 20:41.609
Mm. Mm.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.208
Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer.

20:45.619 --> 20:49.715
Superb density. Hints of vanilla.
Cinnamon?

20:50.091 --> 20:53.185
- That's right.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.763
- Well, I'm glad you like them.
- Like them? I wanna buy your recipe.

20:57.932 --> 21:01.459
- Oh! I'll give you the recipe, Mr. Royalton.
- Nonsense!

21:01.635 --> 21:04.195
Cenestro Foods, a subdivision
of Royalton Industries...

21:04.371 --> 21:07.067
...is planning a range
of homecooked meals for travelers...

21:07.241 --> 21:09.801
...and this is just the kind of magic
we're looking for.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.309
I'll have my attorney
draw up the paperwork.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.604
Hmm.

21:14.482 --> 21:18.680
Now, then, we all know the reason
I'm here is because of you, Speed.

21:18.853 --> 21:20.582
I was watching last night...

21:20.755 --> 21:24.714
...and I have to tell you, young man,
you gave me goose bumps.

21:26.127 --> 21:30.621
I knew at once this was no mere driver
I was watching. This was an artist.

21:30.798 --> 21:32.493
Oh...

21:32.967 --> 21:36.164
I imagine the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

21:36.437 --> 21:40.635
Yeah. But Speed doesn't wanna
drive for you or any other sponsors.

21:40.975 --> 21:42.704
Is this your manager, then?

21:42.877 --> 21:46.142
- That's our youngest, Spritle.
- Nice to meet you, youngster.

21:47.248 --> 21:49.478
We got our eye on you, mister.

21:50.584 --> 21:52.916
Excellent.

21:53.387 --> 21:57.414
The first thing I want to make clear
is that I have no intention whatsoever...

21:57.591 --> 22:00.355
...of trying to get Speed
away from Racer Motors.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.125
What you have here
is what teams spend years...

22:03.297 --> 22:06.664
...and millions of dollars
trying to achieve, chemistry.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.859
I wouldn't dare touch a thing.

22:09.036 --> 22:13.370
Well, excuse me for asking,
but what do you want?

22:14.008 --> 22:15.839
To help.

22:16.010 --> 22:19.946
I want to make sure you have access
to whatever resources you need...

22:20.114 --> 22:22.344
...to continue doing
exactly what you're doing.

22:22.516 --> 22:26.350
No offense, Royalton, but Racer Motors
has always run as an independent.

22:26.787 --> 22:29.278
None taken. I completely understand.
I sympathize.

22:29.456 --> 22:32.482
- Strike that. I empathize.
- Hmm.

22:32.660 --> 22:35.390
You may think of R.I.
as a huge corporate conglomerate...

22:35.563 --> 22:38.623
...but I will have you know
I still remember working all night...

22:38.799 --> 22:42.565
...on a Commodore 64 in the basement
of my foster parents' home.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.762
I built R.I. from below the ground up.

22:45.940 --> 22:49.535
So while Royalton Industries
may look like a major sponsor to you...

22:49.710 --> 22:52.577
...it remains in my heart
as independent to me...

22:52.746 --> 22:57.843
...as the first day I quit my job at GloBoCom
to start working for myself.

22:59.386 --> 23:01.047
Now, then...

23:01.689 --> 23:07.184
...I've had this wonderful opportunity
to meet your family.

23:08.495 --> 23:11.760
All I'm asking for is the chance
to introduce you to mine.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.066
I've never flown so low through the city.

23:23.577 --> 23:26.944
Special permit.
Only six of them are granted a year.

23:32.086 --> 23:34.418
Take whatever you like.

23:34.755 --> 23:36.188
Thank you.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.522
Spritle!
- What? She said we could have some.

23:42.162 --> 23:44.824
All right, maybe one apiece.

23:45.799 --> 23:49.098
Hey, look,
that's the Grand Prix Colosseum.

23:49.270 --> 23:51.465
My brother's gonna win
the Grand Prix someday.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.971
No doubt in my mind, young man.

23:54.141 --> 23:58.635
Given the right circumstances,
no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

24:19.833 --> 24:23.269
This is Gennie, our talent manager.

24:23.437 --> 24:26.736
Ask for anything.
Her job is to make it come true.

24:26.907 --> 24:29.432
Hello, Speed. Welcome to Royalton.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.081
- What's this?
- To make an informed decision...

24:36.250 --> 24:38.980
...you'll have to understand
how we take care of our drivers.

24:39.420 --> 24:40.819
All aboard.

24:40.988 --> 24:42.979
Oh, cool!

24:52.466 --> 24:56.596
Royalton Tower is the crown jewel
among the properties that I control.

24:56.770 --> 25:00.866
It functions as the corporate headquarters
for the top 12 divisions of our parent corp.

25:01.775 --> 25:04.369
One big industrious family.

25:07.481 --> 25:11.110
Our vertically integrated plant
is the fastest in the world...

25:11.285 --> 25:15.722
...from initial carbon bond to finished car
in 36 hours.

25:18.993 --> 25:21.086
How long does it take at Racer Motors?

25:21.261 --> 25:23.354
- Mmm...
- Several weeks, at least.

25:24.832 --> 25:28.666
This kind of production facility
could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer.

25:28.836 --> 25:29.860
Hm. Yeah.

25:30.337 --> 25:31.929
This is our operating theater...

25:32.106 --> 25:36.600
...where our patented Refusion Distributor
is installed in the turbine drive.

25:36.777 --> 25:38.506
Is that an Inner-Positive Transponder?

25:38.679 --> 25:42.206
We control the only transponder foundry
in the world...

25:42.583 --> 25:44.813
...outside of Musha Motors.

25:45.519 --> 25:48.716
Oops. Sorry, trade secret.

25:48.889 --> 25:53.952
As you know, a T-180 driver's
got to be in peak physical condition.

25:54.128 --> 25:57.586
No expense is spared to ensure that
when our drivers suit up...

25:57.931 --> 26:02.300
...they are as perfectly tuned as
the machines they are controlling.

26:02.469 --> 26:06.166
The best drivers must be able
to withstand over four G's of force...

26:06.340 --> 26:08.365
...in a typical race.

26:08.709 --> 26:12.145
The will to win is nothing
without the will to prepare.

26:14.314 --> 26:19.718
And at Team Royalton,
we prepare our drivers for any eventuality...

26:20.154 --> 26:22.952
...and every possible condition.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.293
I hope I didn't scare you, Speed,
with how hard we push our team.

26:33.467 --> 26:36.265
I just wanted you to see
how committed we are to winning.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.505
- I get that.
- Good.

26:40.674 --> 26:44.576
Because I also want you to understand
that R.I. isn't all work and no play.

26:59.393 --> 27:01.725
That's Cannonball Taylor.

27:03.430 --> 27:05.830
Stop the car. Jack.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.793
Jack, come here.

27:09.736 --> 27:11.670
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

27:12.039 --> 27:13.836
Speed Racer.

27:14.007 --> 27:17.306
Allow me to introduce
two-time Grand Prix winner...

27:17.478 --> 27:21.471
...five-time WRL Champion
and future hall of famer...

27:21.648 --> 27:23.616
...Jack "Cannonball" Taylor.

27:23.784 --> 27:26.014
Oh... Honor to meet you.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.050
Caught that Thunderhead replay.

27:29.223 --> 27:30.281
Nice piece of work.

27:30.924 --> 27:32.414
Wow.

27:32.593 --> 27:34.220
Thanks.

27:34.461 --> 27:36.656
There was a rumor you might be visiting.

27:37.397 --> 27:40.423
It's pretty impressive.

27:41.068 --> 27:44.504
Only thing I cared about
was that wall over there.

27:44.838 --> 27:46.203
That's what sold me.

27:46.373 --> 27:49.467
You want to win in this league,
you're talking to the right guy.

27:51.445 --> 27:53.174
Thanks, Jack.

28:05.459 --> 28:07.359
Sweet!

28:07.561 --> 28:11.861
We treat our thoroughbreds
the way they deserve to be treated.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.701
- Sweet!
- There's a full maid service, of course...

28:15.869 --> 28:19.805
...with personal chef and masseurs
available 24/7.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.402
Sweet!

28:25.546 --> 28:27.013
Thank you.

28:30.384 --> 28:33.376
It should be perfect. Try it on.

28:33.554 --> 28:35.317
Mm-hm.

28:36.490 --> 28:38.117
Okay.

28:42.196 --> 28:43.925
So, Mrs. Racer...

28:45.032 --> 28:47.865
...what do you think about my family?
Impressed?

28:48.969 --> 28:51.699
- You could say that.
- Good.

28:51.872 --> 28:56.002
Because I want you to understand the
possibilities that exist for your son now.

28:57.177 --> 28:58.371
What's wrong, Mr. Racer?

28:58.812 --> 29:03.044
To be honest, Royalton, I'm feeling
more intimidated than impressed.

29:03.217 --> 29:05.515
This kind of company scares me.

29:06.019 --> 29:08.487
People like you
have way too much money.

29:08.655 --> 29:11.021
When someone gets that kind of money,
they think...

29:11.191 --> 29:15.184
...that the rules everybody else plays by
don't mean squat to them.

29:15.929 --> 29:20.559
However, my sons are the most important
thing I've ever done in my life...

29:20.734 --> 29:22.998
...besides marrying my best friend.

29:23.170 --> 29:28.233
And if Speed wants us to
figure out some kind of an alliance...

29:30.978 --> 29:33.606
...then you can bet your ass
we'll be in business.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.239
Ah.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.879
Hubba-hubba.

29:39.052 --> 29:42.385
- Oh, honey, you look so handsome.
- Yeah?

29:42.556 --> 29:45.252
Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly.

29:45.425 --> 29:48.292
Regardless of what happens,
I want you to have it as a gift.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.097
Thanks, Mr. Royalton.

29:53.467 --> 29:56.095
So how are you feeling, Speed?

29:56.370 --> 29:58.429
It's very...

29:58.605 --> 30:00.163
...impressive.

30:00.474 --> 30:03.739
You think that maybe there's something
that could work out here?

30:09.082 --> 30:12.916
I guess I'd like to think about it,
if I could.

30:13.654 --> 30:16.646
This isn't the kind of offer
I go around making every day, son.

30:17.791 --> 30:20.487
No, I understand that, sir.

30:21.695 --> 30:25.927
So if I had to give you an answer now,
then to be honest...

30:26.099 --> 30:27.464
Stop right there.

30:27.634 --> 30:30.034
You're right. You should think about it.

30:30.437 --> 30:33.338
I'm sure you're feeling
a bit overwhelmed.

30:33.507 --> 30:35.668
You should take a little time...

30:35.842 --> 30:40.836
...think about what you saw and heard here,
and we'll get together early next week.

30:41.715 --> 30:44.445
- Deal?
- Deal.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.781
I thought we had a deal.

30:54.428 --> 30:56.157
I thought we were friends.

30:59.833 --> 31:03.234
Well, maybe where you come from,
that's how you treat your friends.

31:03.670 --> 31:07.629
But around here, we don't take
too kindly to it, do we, fellas?

31:09.009 --> 31:10.499
It hurts our feelings.

31:10.944 --> 31:12.468
Problem is...

31:13.447 --> 31:15.745
...I like you, Taejo.

31:16.750 --> 31:20.481
And I've got a real soft spot
in my heart...

31:20.654 --> 31:23.179
...for that sister of yours.

31:27.761 --> 31:32.596
And normally, under circumstances
such as this...

31:32.766 --> 31:35.234
...we'd be pouring you a nice...

31:35.402 --> 31:39.736
...comfortable pair of concrete shoes.

31:40.507 --> 31:44.034
But I think I thought of another solution.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.906
How are my babies, huh?

31:50.317 --> 31:52.148
Hungry?

32:02.729 --> 32:04.993
Ready for seconds?

32:06.299 --> 32:07.823
Boys.

32:08.869 --> 32:10.200
No!

32:10.370 --> 32:14.204
Don't worry, it only hurts for a few seconds,
then you'll probably black out.

32:14.374 --> 32:15.432
No, please!

32:19.413 --> 32:21.381
It'll be hard to drive with skellie hands.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.745
No, please.
- You even think about turning rat...

32:24.918 --> 32:27.910
...and next time it's your sister
going in there!

32:37.764 --> 32:40.130
- What?
- Someone's tailing us.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.303
- Is it him?
- It could be.

32:52.312 --> 32:54.143
- Oh, God.
- It's him!

33:05.992 --> 33:07.254
Crush him!

33:28.048 --> 33:29.106
He's out front.

33:37.257 --> 33:38.281
Got you.

34:25.371 --> 34:27.737
- Boss!
- My babies.

34:29.743 --> 34:33.679
My babies! Put your finger in there.

34:34.748 --> 34:36.375
Do it!

34:40.820 --> 34:44.380
Nice fishies, nice fishes. No, no, no.

34:45.158 --> 34:46.955
<i>We can't take another hit, boss!</i>

34:47.127 --> 34:48.525
Aah!
- Pull over.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.391
But don't stop.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.579
Are you hurt?

35:16.289 --> 35:17.881
No.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.788
Then get up.

35:23.363 --> 35:26.332
Thank you. You saved my life.

35:26.499 --> 35:30.731
I didn't save anything worth saving
unless you get smart real fast.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.529
You thought you could
take on the cartel.

35:33.707 --> 35:35.800
You can't. Not without help.

35:37.310 --> 35:38.902
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:39.412 --> 35:42.643
You have been on Cruncher Block's leash
for so long...

35:42.816 --> 35:46.115
...maybe you forgot how it feels
to stand up and be a man.

35:47.988 --> 35:51.685
The only way you'll ever stop these people
is to bring them to justice.

35:52.092 --> 35:53.753
Justice?

35:54.461 --> 35:56.793
That's a commodity
I don't waste my money on.

35:57.297 --> 35:58.321
Hm.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.529
Get out.

36:10.543 --> 36:13.205
- I'll see you at Fuji.
- You won't finish.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.713
When you lose, if you can still
dial a phone...

36:16.883 --> 36:18.350
...call this number.

36:19.753 --> 36:22.153
You're really considering
signing with Royalton.

36:22.322 --> 36:25.519
- I just said it was tempting.
- Why?

36:25.692 --> 36:27.922
Well, they got a really good team.

36:28.094 --> 36:32.531
Cannonball Taylor, Maggie Manifold.
They win a lot of majors.

36:33.199 --> 36:36.600
And since when did winning
become so important?

36:37.504 --> 36:39.267
It is important.

36:39.439 --> 36:42.931
You gotta win if you wanna keep driving,
and that's what I wanna do.

36:43.309 --> 36:47.405
- It's the only thing I really know how to do.
- That's not true.

36:47.580 --> 36:51.016
Come on. I wouldn't have made it
out of high school without your help.

36:51.184 --> 36:53.550
Okay, well, that's true.

36:54.854 --> 37:00.053
But when I'm in a T-180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.

37:02.996 --> 37:08.161
So are you saying
this doesn't make sense?

37:09.402 --> 37:12.235
Okay, this makes sense too.

37:12.572 --> 37:13.834
Oh.

37:14.007 --> 37:15.941
So you like this?

37:16.643 --> 37:19.771
Yeah. This ain't so bad.

37:21.314 --> 37:23.839
I was starting to wonder.

37:25.251 --> 37:26.275
Wonder what?

37:26.453 --> 37:31.550
Well, with you so busy becoming
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver...

37:31.725 --> 37:36.025
...I was starting to wonder
if you were still interested in this.

37:37.731 --> 37:40.359
- You know I am.
- Do I?

37:40.533 --> 37:42.467
What, like you forgot?

37:42.635 --> 37:45.263
- Maybe I need a reminder.
- A reminder.

37:45.505 --> 37:47.268
Sometimes a girl could use a reminder.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.136
You mean like a new igniter
for your helicopter?

37:50.443 --> 37:51.467
Mm-mm.

37:52.145 --> 37:55.376
Well, how about a tire burn
that spells out your name?

37:56.382 --> 37:57.406
Warmer.

37:57.584 --> 38:03.147
Maybe at the end of some big race,
when I pull into Victory Lane...

38:03.323 --> 38:07.419
...I scoop you up and kiss you,
with thousands of flashbulbs going off.

38:08.928 --> 38:12.830
Would that be so terrible,
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver?

38:14.267 --> 38:15.996
I don't know.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.935
- Maybe we should practice.
- Maybe we should.

38:21.207 --> 38:24.301
Oh, God, I'm gonna hurl.

38:24.477 --> 38:26.638
- Spritle.
- He did not.

38:33.019 --> 38:36.455
- Ooh, Spritle.
- You little sneak.

38:37.157 --> 38:39.421
- It wasn't my idea.
- Oh, no?

38:39.692 --> 38:42.320
- It was his.
- Wait till we tell Pops.

38:42.495 --> 38:46.693
No, don't do that. We couldn't sleep.
We just wanted to hang out.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.596
We didn't know you were going to
In-spew-ation Point.

38:50.503 --> 38:52.630
By the way, cootie shot.

38:52.806 --> 38:54.296
I'm taking you home.

38:54.641 --> 38:57.974
Wait. Wait.
Can we stop for ice cream first?

39:03.483 --> 39:07.283
The new GRX has
a supercharged Inner-Positive Transponder...

39:07.453 --> 39:11.753
...and will be capable of speeds
in excess of 800 kilometers an hour.

39:11.925 --> 39:15.793
If such a car were to
win the Grand Prix this year...

39:15.962 --> 39:20.365
...one would expect the demand for
transponders to increase dramatically.

39:20.533 --> 39:22.057
One would expect.

39:22.235 --> 39:27.798
And if a single company gained control of
all the transponder foundries in the world...

39:27.974 --> 39:31.432
...one might expect that company
to do very well for itself.

39:31.611 --> 39:34.171
You know what I want.
I know for the last few years...

39:34.347 --> 39:37.407
...you've been trying to buy out
your main rival, Tetsua Togokahn.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.178
The question is, can we make a deal?

39:43.523 --> 39:48.654
Deliver Togokahn at that price
and the transponder foundry is yours.

39:49.529 --> 39:50.996
Done.

39:58.705 --> 40:01.731
- Speed!
- Mr. Royalton.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.806
Welcome!

40:04.310 --> 40:07.438
Come here. Look at this.

40:10.416 --> 40:11.974
Oh.

40:12.352 --> 40:13.410
Wow.

40:13.586 --> 40:17.454
That's what I thought. We're still working
on the R and R, but it's getting there.

40:17.624 --> 40:20.218
Come, sit. We can talk logos later.

40:20.393 --> 40:24.557
Can I get you something to drink?
Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye?

40:24.731 --> 40:26.858
No. I'm okay.

40:28.768 --> 40:33.432
So I can see you've been giving
some serious thought to this thing.

40:34.741 --> 40:38.404
- I have. Yes, sir.
- Good.

40:38.578 --> 40:41.513
Means you understand we're talking
about not just your future...

40:41.681 --> 40:43.080
...but your family's future.

40:44.117 --> 40:45.880
My family means a lot to me.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.316
I know. I can tell.

40:48.488 --> 40:52.652
That's why this is so important,
because you can help them.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.656
All you have to say is yes.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.556
That's all I need to hear...

40:56.729 --> 40:59.755
...and I can make so many things happen
for you and your family.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.265
You ready for that?

41:04.437 --> 41:06.462
You ready to say yes, Speed?

41:33.800 --> 41:36.200
Jackpot.

41:38.471 --> 41:39.597
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

41:42.075 --> 41:44.703
This isn't an easy decision for me,
Mr. Royalton.

41:47.280 --> 41:51.580
For my family, racing's everything.

41:52.051 --> 41:56.112
I was tooling timing pins with Pops
while I was still wearing diapers.

41:56.289 --> 42:00.316
I mean, there's nothing more perfect
than a picnic at Thunderhead.

42:04.330 --> 42:08.926
But when my brother died,
all that went away.

42:09.836 --> 42:12.270
I can't tell you how painful that was.

42:12.438 --> 42:14.838
It nearly killed all of us.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.740
Especially Pops.

42:18.111 --> 42:21.205
He didn't set foot in his shop
for over a year.

42:23.649 --> 42:26.880
But one night, when I was still
pretty young, I couldn't sleep...

42:27.053 --> 42:30.648
...and I went into the living room,
and there was Pops in his beat-up robe...

42:30.823 --> 42:33.348
...watching some old race recordings.

42:38.431 --> 42:39.659
So I sat with him there...

42:39.832 --> 42:44.462
...watching old Ben Burns coming around
the last turn of the 43 Prix and...

42:44.637 --> 42:47.834
...all of a sudden,
Pops started screaming.

42:48.007 --> 42:49.167
Go!

42:49.909 --> 42:51.274
<i>And then I started screaming.</i>

42:52.879 --> 42:55.370
As Burns and Stickleton
headed for the finish...

42:55.548 --> 42:57.516
...we were cheering our heads off.

43:01.054 --> 43:04.217
And the second the black-and-white
came down...

43:04.524 --> 43:07.687
...we looked at each other
and we realized...

43:08.061 --> 43:10.325
...racing's in our blood.

43:11.731 --> 43:13.892
But for Pops...

43:14.500 --> 43:16.331
...it isn't just a sport.

43:16.502 --> 43:19.130
It's way more important than that.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.739
It's like a religion.

43:21.908 --> 43:25.241
And in our house, the major sponsors...

43:25.411 --> 43:27.106
...are kind of like the devil.

43:28.314 --> 43:32.580
I don't mean to offend you, sir,
and I do appreciate your offer...

43:33.519 --> 43:36.215
...but after all we've been through...

43:37.790 --> 43:40.258
...I don't think this kind of deal's for me.

43:49.168 --> 43:51.432
You poor, naive chump.

43:54.941 --> 43:57.375
I'll pretend I didn't hear
that sickening schmaltz...

43:57.543 --> 44:00.535
...and I'll give you an education.
At the end, if you're smart...

44:00.713 --> 44:03.944
...you'll thank me
and then you'll sign that contract.

44:11.057 --> 44:12.524
Huh?

44:14.293 --> 44:15.851
Huh?

44:23.736 --> 44:25.169
Jig's up.

44:28.174 --> 44:29.937
Holy moly.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.676
Hey. This is Marvin,
down at the landing pad.

44:35.148 --> 44:37.343
I think we got mice again.

44:37.517 --> 44:40.543
<i>All right. We'll send
someone over to take care of it. Over.</i>

44:41.020 --> 44:45.457
Look. There is the true spirit
of the golden age of racing.

44:45.858 --> 44:50.693
Benjamin Braddack, Reginald White, George
Wheeler, Diamond Dave Tewksbury...

44:50.863 --> 44:52.455
...and Oliver Potter.

44:52.965 --> 44:56.457
The five most powerful men in the world
at the turn of the last century.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.464
For all intents and purposes, they created
the modern automotive industry.

45:00.640 --> 45:04.406
But the true stroke of their genius
was the invention of the WRL...

45:04.577 --> 45:06.875
<i>... the world's first racing league.</i>

45:15.121 --> 45:19.217
Interesting that you and your father
were so moved by the 43 Prix.

45:19.392 --> 45:22.156
One of the great finishes
in the history of racing, right?

45:22.328 --> 45:26.424
Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton
slugging it out.

45:26.599 --> 45:29.534
But who remembers Carl Potts?

45:30.269 --> 45:33.705
Driving this rebuilt Wittigan
for Iodyne Industries...

45:33.873 --> 45:37.104
...Potts spun out in the second lap
and went down as a DNF...

45:37.443 --> 45:39.377
<i>... a forgettable and pathetic finish.</i>

45:39.545 --> 45:44.073
So bad that afterwards,
Iodyne stock dropped six points.

45:44.250 --> 45:48.949
But as Ben Burns sat guzzling
cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane...

45:49.121 --> 45:51.089
<i>... a thousand cameras
taking his picture...</i>

45:51.524 --> 45:54.118
...Sirrus Aeronautics saw
almost a 12-point gain...

45:54.293 --> 45:56.523
...which blocked Peninsula Power Cell...

45:56.696 --> 45:59.130
...from being able to afford
the price of a takeover.

45:59.298 --> 46:03.894
This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne,
Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in.

46:04.070 --> 46:07.699
By first buying controlling interest
in his own company at a devalued price...

46:07.873 --> 46:12.708
...he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that
sent Iodyne into the gains record book...

46:12.878 --> 46:15.608
...the only record book that matters.

46:15.915 --> 46:19.817
Look out that window. There isn't
a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier...

46:19.986 --> 46:22.614
...that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells.

46:22.788 --> 46:26.918
That's what racing is about.
It has nothing to do with cars or drivers.

46:27.093 --> 46:31.325
All that matters is power
and the unassailable might of money.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.794
Whoo!

46:32.965 --> 46:35.263
Dude! Yeah!

46:38.104 --> 46:40.834
Oh, no! Woo-hoo!

46:41.741 --> 46:44.972
Get out of the way! Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

46:55.888 --> 46:57.879
You understand?

46:58.057 --> 47:00.855
Burns knew he was going to win.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.791
It was already decided.

47:04.196 --> 47:06.630
A week before the Prix,
Goldman and Sirrus...

47:06.799 --> 47:09.427
...met with other major players
at the Cargyle Hotel.

47:09.602 --> 47:11.331
They met there as they had for years.

47:11.504 --> 47:15.167
They met to negotiate
the finish order of the Grand Prix.

47:15.341 --> 47:19.209
No race is more important
and no race is more controlled.

47:20.313 --> 47:23.214
Goldman was supposed to win,
but he knew if he sold his win...

47:23.382 --> 47:27.443
...whatever that win might be worth was
nothing compared to what could be gained.

47:27.620 --> 47:33.252
That's why I spent $3 million
on this burnt and twisted lump of metal.

47:33.426 --> 47:36.088
Because it reminds me
of what really matters.

47:36.262 --> 47:40.255
This is the true heart of racing, boy.

47:40.433 --> 47:43.800
This is my religion.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.000
You don't know how often
I've seen that same cow-eyed...

47:50.176 --> 47:52.144
..."say it isn't so" look of disbelief.

47:52.311 --> 47:55.838
Every bumpkin who comes in from
the sticks looks exactly as you do now.

47:56.015 --> 47:57.573
I won't bother proving it to you.

47:57.750 --> 48:01.686
You walk away from me and this deal,
you'll know how true it is soon enough.

48:01.854 --> 48:05.517
So last chance. You ready to
put away your toys and grow up?

48:05.691 --> 48:09.354
Are you ready to make more money in
one year than your father made in his life?

48:09.528 --> 48:13.726
Are you ready to become a real
racecar driver? Then sign that contract!

48:30.049 --> 48:31.243
Spearhook.

48:47.066 --> 48:48.431
What's this?

48:48.601 --> 48:51.434
If that's your idea of racing,
you can keep it.

48:57.243 --> 48:58.801
Listen to me and listen good...

48:58.978 --> 49:01.446
...because I'm gonna give you
one more history lesson.

49:01.614 --> 49:05.846
You're gonna go to Fuji and try and prove
everything I told you is nothing but a lie.

49:06.018 --> 49:09.010
But no matter how well you drive,
you won't win, you won't place.

49:09.188 --> 49:13.056
I guarantee you right now,
you won't even finish the race.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.228
Speed Racer's making his move,
gunning for the lead.

49:43.556 --> 49:44.750
Ha!

49:54.900 --> 49:57.425
The Harbinger of Boom
once again leaves his mark...

49:57.603 --> 50:00.163
...a trail of carnage and chaos
cartwheeling behind him!

50:00.339 --> 50:03.399
- Oh, but the fans love it, don't they?
- They do, God help them.

50:03.576 --> 50:06.374
They're about to get more
as Iodyne is now slugging it out...

50:06.545 --> 50:08.479
<i>... with young Taejo Togokahn.</i>

50:12.785 --> 50:14.047
Whoo!

50:40.079 --> 50:41.603
<i>Oh, terrible crash!</i>

50:41.780 --> 50:44.271
<i>They'll have to fish
Taejo and Billy Ray out of the drink.</i>

50:44.450 --> 50:46.145
<i>But this race is far from over.</i>

50:46.318 --> 50:50.152
<i>Right now, one car
stands between Speed Racer and the lead:</i>

50:50.322 --> 50:52.984
<i>- The Grey Ghost.
- We got ourselves a real race here!</i>

50:58.197 --> 51:01.030
Show me what you got.
Show me what you got!

51:05.538 --> 51:07.005
Woo-hoo!

51:18.217 --> 51:21.482
- Speed, get out of there!
- I can't. I can't move!

51:40.606 --> 51:45.873
Soon after that, there will be litigation
against some of your father's designs.

51:46.412 --> 51:48.710
Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors?

51:48.881 --> 51:52.146
- Yeah, but I'm still on vacation.
- You are hereby served a summons.

51:52.318 --> 51:55.549
- What?
- You are being sued for IP infringement...

51:55.821 --> 51:57.379
...by Janus Automakers.

51:57.556 --> 51:59.820
- No way!
- That's ridiculous.

51:59.992 --> 52:02.620
That's for a jury to decide.

52:03.929 --> 52:06.022
<i>The legitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter.</i>

52:06.198 --> 52:08.428
<i>They'll be enough
to discredit his company.</i>

52:08.601 --> 52:12.594
Whatever contracts he has, he'll lose.
Within a year, he'll be filing for bankruptcy.

52:12.771 --> 52:16.764
After that, you and the rest of
your pathetic family will be history.

52:17.876 --> 52:19.867
Pops is right.

52:20.212 --> 52:21.645
You are the devil.

52:23.115 --> 52:25.413
Mr. Royalton.
- What?!

52:26.151 --> 52:27.243
- Speed!
- Spritle?

52:27.419 --> 52:30.320
I found these two sneaking around
a restricted area.

52:30.489 --> 52:33.458
Get this Racer trash out of my building.

52:33.626 --> 52:36.220
- I'll see you in Fuji.
- Yes.

52:36.395 --> 52:40.422
And then you'll find out you just made
the biggest mistake of your life!

52:49.842 --> 52:51.469
Hey, kid.

52:54.513 --> 52:57.880
- Ben Burns?
- Nice race.

52:58.050 --> 53:00.712
I ain't seen moves like that
in a long time.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.451
It didn't matter, I still lost.

53:04.690 --> 53:07.557
Yeah. Tough break.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.756
Well, good luck.

53:18.370 --> 53:20.634
Mr. Burns, can I ask you something?

53:21.807 --> 53:23.035
Sure, kid.

53:25.411 --> 53:26.639
The 43 Prix.

53:28.814 --> 53:31.078
Did you know you were gonna win?

53:33.118 --> 53:36.713
You know, everybody thought that
me and Stickleton hated each other.

53:38.023 --> 53:39.786
Funny, ain't it?

53:46.298 --> 53:50.496
"Controversy surrounds Racer
Motors, now embroiled in IP litigation.

53:50.669 --> 53:52.660
And while evidence
remains inconclusive...

53:52.838 --> 53:55.238
...whether or not Speed
used an illegal device...

53:56.075 --> 53:59.738
...the Fuji-Helexicon seems destined to
become another mark of shame...

53:59.912 --> 54:02.472
...added to the notorious
Racer family legacy...

54:02.648 --> 54:05.515
...a legacy that has forever tainted
the integrity of this..."

54:05.684 --> 54:07.242
Sparky.

54:08.353 --> 54:10.048
Sorry, ma'am.

54:10.322 --> 54:12.552
I'm gonna send that guy
some Chim Chim cookies.

54:13.959 --> 54:16.757
- You'll do no such thing.
- We gotta do something, Pops.

54:16.929 --> 54:20.194
This is exactly what he said would happen
if I didn't drive for him.

54:20.365 --> 54:23.425
He's just trying to scare you.
They tried the same thing with Rex.

54:23.602 --> 54:25.866
It's a fight they want,
it's a fight they'll get.

54:26.038 --> 54:29.940
How? What can we do?
How can we fight this?

54:30.342 --> 54:31.707
The truth'll come out.

54:32.344 --> 54:34.244
The truth?

54:34.513 --> 54:36.708
Don't be naive, Pops.

54:53.165 --> 54:54.826
Speed?

54:55.567 --> 54:57.558
Are you all right?

54:58.670 --> 54:59.762
I don't know.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.271
It's gonna be okay. We'll work this out.

55:09.948 --> 55:13.384
I don't know, Mom.
I may have really messed things up.

55:13.552 --> 55:15.417
How?

55:16.155 --> 55:17.816
By not joining Royalton.

55:18.223 --> 55:22.626
Oh, don't be silly. You never would have
been happy racing for that terrible man.

55:23.729 --> 55:26.163
Maybe that's not the point.

55:26.331 --> 55:28.959
Maybe Royalton's right
and racing's all about business...

55:29.134 --> 55:31.796
...and anyone who doesn't understand
that is just a chump.

55:31.970 --> 55:33.494
Now you listen to me, young man.

55:33.672 --> 55:38.939
What you do behind the wheel of a racecar
has nothing to do with business.

55:39.111 --> 55:42.808
Before you could even talk, you were
making noises that sounded like an engine.

55:43.348 --> 55:46.875
We tried to take you to the park
and you never wanted to get out of the car.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.485
I loved that old wagon.

55:48.654 --> 55:53.114
And you remember when Rex took you out
to Thunderhead and let you drive?

55:53.492 --> 55:55.084
And I turned it over.

55:55.260 --> 55:58.491
Oh, my heart starts pounding
just thinking about it.

55:59.731 --> 56:05.101
Mom! Yeah, you should've seen it! Yeah!

56:05.270 --> 56:09.673
Rex told me the only reason we survived
was because I was wearing red socks.

56:09.875 --> 56:12.139
I thought your father
would have a heart attack...

56:12.311 --> 56:14.211
...when you came in
with that crazy smile.

56:15.480 --> 56:20.179
Speed, when I watch you do
some of the things you do...

56:20.352 --> 56:25.119
...I feel like I'm watching
someone paint or make music.

56:25.290 --> 56:28.782
I go to the races to watch you make art.

56:28.961 --> 56:30.792
And it's beautiful...

56:30.963 --> 56:32.396
...and inspiring...

56:32.564 --> 56:35.431
...and everything that art should be.

56:35.601 --> 56:41.597
Even though there are times
when I have to close my eyes.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.704
But then there are other times...

56:46.111 --> 56:48.443
...when you just take my breath away.

56:49.715 --> 56:54.084
And it's at those moments
when I feel your father's chest swell...

56:54.253 --> 56:55.880
...and I know that he's smiling...

56:56.054 --> 57:00.047
...because he's pretending that
he doesn't have tears in his eyes...

57:00.225 --> 57:02.455
...that I just go to pieces.

57:03.896 --> 57:05.090
Why?

57:06.431 --> 57:10.891
Because I am so impossibly proud
to be your mom.

57:13.705 --> 57:16.697
It's gonna be okay, honey.
You'll see. We'll work this out.

57:16.875 --> 57:20.868
We just have to stick together
and something good will happen.

57:21.046 --> 57:22.104
You'll see.

57:34.393 --> 57:37.294
Racer X! The Harbinger of Boom!

57:37.462 --> 57:38.622
Run for your lives!

57:42.768 --> 57:44.793
What are you two squawking about?

57:44.970 --> 57:48.064
Pops, whatever you do,
don't open that door.

57:50.442 --> 57:51.909
This is a bad idea.

57:52.077 --> 57:54.068
If it was any other driver, you'd be here.

57:56.381 --> 57:57.678
Inspector Detector.

57:57.849 --> 58:01.444
Good morning, Mr. Racer.
I know it's been a long time.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.312
Ten years.

58:04.389 --> 58:08.052
We've been after Royalton for years
for dozens of capital corporate crimes...

58:08.226 --> 58:12.993
...including WRL fixing, but we haven't had
the evidence we needed to convict him...

58:13.165 --> 58:14.462
...until now.

58:14.633 --> 58:16.464
What's he doing here?

58:16.635 --> 58:19.661
Racer X works closely with our
WRL Corporate Crimes Division...

58:19.838 --> 58:22.033
...helping us recruit
drivers like you, Speed.

58:23.275 --> 58:25.505
Why does he always wear that mask?

58:25.677 --> 58:29.306
If any of you knew his identity,
you'd become targets for his enemies...

58:29.481 --> 58:33.178
...which include some of
the most vicious fixers in the world.

58:35.253 --> 58:36.447
What do you want with me?

58:36.621 --> 58:39.055
Are you familiar with the driver
Taejo Togokahn?

58:39.391 --> 58:40.881
- Of course.
- For years...

58:41.059 --> 58:44.551
...he's been contracted by a fixer
named Cruncher Block.

58:44.730 --> 58:48.166
<i>Recently, Taejo's been forced to lose races,
and he began resisting...</i>

58:48.333 --> 58:50.858
<i>... thinking that he could do it on his own.</i>

58:52.504 --> 58:55.701
- After Fuji, he realized he needed help.
- Why help him?

58:56.041 --> 58:59.636
Because he has a file with enough
information to connect Block to Royalton...

58:59.845 --> 59:03.178
...which could put both of them
behind bars for the rest of their lives.

59:03.348 --> 59:05.373
The problem is,
he won't give us the file...

59:05.550 --> 59:09.486
...unless we help him stop
the takeover of his family's company.

59:09.654 --> 59:11.087
How?

59:13.525 --> 59:16.323
There's an upcoming race
that Taejo believes if he can win...

59:16.495 --> 59:19.020
...it'll catapult Togokahn Motors
into the spotlight...

59:19.197 --> 59:21.722
...double the cost of the buyout,
which should kill it.

59:21.900 --> 59:24.528
There aren't any more races left
except the Grand Prix...

59:24.703 --> 59:26.603
...and we both failed to qualify.

59:26.772 --> 59:30.230
Ahem. There aren't any more track races.

59:31.476 --> 59:33.034
This is a cross-country rally.

59:33.478 --> 59:35.070
Casa Cristo.

59:35.313 --> 59:36.746
What?

59:36.948 --> 59:39.109
I know it seems cruel of me to ask.

59:39.284 --> 59:42.082
Taejo made it clear he had
to have Speed and X on his team...

59:42.254 --> 59:44.586
...or there would be no deal.
- Absolutely not.

59:44.756 --> 59:47.418
- You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B.
- No.

59:47.959 --> 59:52.157
Rally racing is a back-alley sport
filled with jackals, headhunters and thugs.

59:52.330 --> 59:56.790
I'm sorry, but I've already lost one son
to that deathtrap. I won't lose another.

59:57.502 --> 59:59.367
I understand.

01:00:00.605 --> 01:00:03.369
- If you change your mind...
- Keep your card, Chief Inspector.

01:00:03.775 --> 01:00:05.709
Thank you for your time.

01:00:13.618 --> 01:00:15.108
But Pops'll never let you go.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.747
He won't if I ask him.

01:00:19.558 --> 01:00:21.719
Speed Racer, what are you thinking?

01:00:21.893 --> 01:00:24.123
You weren't in Royalton's office, Trix.

01:00:24.596 --> 01:00:26.826
You don't know what it was like.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:29.398
It felt as though he had his hand
inside my chest...

01:00:29.568 --> 01:00:33.368
...and he was trying to crush everything
in my life that mattered to me.

01:00:35.774 --> 01:00:38.641
All right. Let's do it.

01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:42.213
You're gonna need an alibi.
We'll say we're going skiing.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.904
What? No way.

01:00:44.082 --> 01:00:45.549
You're gonna need my help.

01:00:45.717 --> 01:00:48.311
Casa Cristo is a rally.
I can spot from a copter.

01:00:48.653 --> 01:00:52.089
Trixie, this isn't a game.
These people play rough.

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:55.316
I know. That's why I'm going with you.

01:00:56.495 --> 01:01:00.898
If you even try to argue with me, I'll tell
Pops and he'll never let you out of his sight.

01:01:01.066 --> 01:01:02.658
You would, wouldn't you?

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.027
Well...

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.074
...I guess we're going skiing.

01:01:11.643 --> 01:01:14.134
<i>We're just minutes away from the start...</i>

01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:16.041
<i>... of the 82nd annual
Casa Cristo Classic...</i>

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.775
<i>... the grande dame of cross-country,
the second-oldest rally race in the world...</i>

01:01:19.951 --> 01:01:22.419
<i>... spanning two continents,
three climate changes...</i>

01:01:22.587 --> 01:01:26.717
<i>... and 5,000 kilometers of the most
winding and treacherous roads ever raced.</i>

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.224
<i>With me again is five-time
Casa Cristo champion...</i>

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.295
<i>Spritle.
- ... Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.</i>

01:01:34.332 --> 01:01:35.731
What are you two doing?

01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:38.662
Just watching a little TV, Pops.

01:01:38.837 --> 01:01:40.498
It's his favorite show.

01:01:43.642 --> 01:01:46.805
- It's in German.
- Not the monkey parts.

01:01:47.546 --> 01:01:49.810
Oh, no, you don't.
You are not watching that race.

01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:52.814
Out you go. Outside. Get some exercise.

01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:55.279
You're too pale.

01:01:55.654 --> 01:01:56.814
Speed.

01:01:57.956 --> 01:02:01.790
I want you to understand how much
the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.292
I'm not doing this to help the C.I.B.

01:02:04.462 --> 01:02:08.489
I don't know anything about corporate
crimes and if I did, it wouldn't really matter.

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:11.431
I'm doing this because
someone's trying to hurt my family...

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.697
...and I'm gonna do everything I can
to hurt him back.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.972
Safety has been a primary concern for Casa
Cristo officials, especially the last few years.

01:02:20.145 --> 01:02:22.909
That's right. There were
a number of fatalities years ago.

01:02:23.081 --> 01:02:25.015
<i>It really had a bad reputation.</i>

01:02:25.183 --> 01:02:27.208
<i>Fans started calling it "The Crucible."</i>

01:02:27.385 --> 01:02:30.047
These are some of the most dangerous
drivers in the world.

01:02:30.222 --> 01:02:32.918
And we expect they'll
do anything they can to stop you.

01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:35.787
Their cars will probably be equipped
with secret weapons...

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:39.226
...so we've modified the Mach 5
to try to counter their attacks.

01:02:39.664 --> 01:02:42.360
The A button will operate
your normal jump-jacks.

01:02:42.534 --> 01:02:46.595
B will seal your cockpit, which we
fortified with bulletproof polymer.

01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:50.332
Should someone go after your tires with,
say, a hidden shank or shredder...

01:02:50.508 --> 01:02:53.068
...the C button will activate
your tire shields.

01:02:53.245 --> 01:02:55.076
However, in the event of any blowout...

01:02:55.247 --> 01:02:58.182
...D will inflate
a Hexadyno emergency spare.

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.148
E will activate these
zircon-tipped saw blades.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.914
They'll cut through almost anything.
Use with discretion.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.558
F will project the tire crampons.

01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:10.194
Finally, G will launch
a remote-control homing bird...

01:03:10.362 --> 01:03:13.820
...that is capable of transmitting
U-CAP footage anywhere you are.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.933
Every race fan has heard the rumors...

01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:19.036
...of spearhooks, tire shanks,
battery boosters.

01:03:19.204 --> 01:03:21.900
Oh, no. While it's true
there have been a few bad apples...

01:03:22.073 --> 01:03:24.837
...on the whole, most teams
stay within league rules.

01:03:31.383 --> 01:03:34.284
Or at least try not to get caught.

01:03:37.155 --> 01:03:39.623
This is wrong, what you are trying to do.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.660
Musha's price is an insult
to five generations of our family.

01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:49.425
And if you die?

01:03:50.468 --> 01:03:52.493
Then will the price be high enough?

01:03:55.073 --> 01:03:57.507
- I have no choice.
- Why?

01:03:59.644 --> 01:04:01.544
He is your father too.

01:04:11.356 --> 01:04:14.189
I finally understand it now, Trix.

01:04:14.359 --> 01:04:16.486
I know why he left us.

01:04:17.595 --> 01:04:22.157
He was trying to change this rotten
business and they killed him for it.

01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:38.376
<i>A lot of drivers believe that
the hardest part of Cristo is the start.</i>

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:41.075
<i>The Muqranna?
- Yeah, those archways are tricky.</i>

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:44.415
<i>And speaking of starts,
here comes the queen of Casa Cristo now.</i>

01:04:45.557 --> 01:04:49.584
<i>The moment the queen sees the sun,
she'll signal the start.</i>

01:04:50.695 --> 01:04:54.290
No, no, no.
This is supposed to be my race.

01:04:54.466 --> 01:04:56.161
<i>I'm supposed to win.</i>

01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:58.427
I got the green light.

01:04:58.903 --> 01:05:02.236
They promised I would
go to the Grand Prix.

01:05:02.407 --> 01:05:05.137
For eight years, I played by the rules!

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:08.370
- This is supposed to be my race!
- Enough!

01:05:08.546 --> 01:05:10.639
I can't stand the whining.

01:05:10.815 --> 01:05:13.215
Like a baby needing its diaper changed.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.519
It's simple.

01:05:16.688 --> 01:05:19.179
We have a team of wild cards.

01:05:19.357 --> 01:05:24.317
The problem is, these wild cards
are better drivers than you.

01:05:24.896 --> 01:05:27.865
What? Like hell they are!

01:05:28.366 --> 01:05:29.390
Prove it.

01:05:30.602 --> 01:05:33.571
Take out Taejo
and the other two will quit.

01:05:34.172 --> 01:05:37.539
You just watch me.

01:05:39.411 --> 01:05:40.435
Come on!

01:06:25.757 --> 01:06:27.019
I got Racer.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:02.723
<i>This team Taejo Togokahn's put together
looks like they mean business.</i>

01:07:11.202 --> 01:07:13.966
As they head out of the city
and into the Zunubian Desert...

01:07:14.138 --> 01:07:17.301
...the team leading the pack
is Snake Oiler!

01:07:17.475 --> 01:07:20.035
Let's pinch these turds off.

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:25.879
Come on! We are falling behind!

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:34.384
Speed! On your right, Flying Foxes!

01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:36.649
Got them.

01:07:54.913 --> 01:07:56.505
Headhunters.

01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:59.441
They're not alone.

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.904
- Oh, no.
- Speed Racer has a blowout!

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.676
Move it, Speed.
It's getting ugly out there.

01:09:32.676 --> 01:09:35.270
Okay, no more Mr. Nice-Guy.

01:09:57.435 --> 01:09:59.995
Hurry, Speed, they need you!

01:10:17.388 --> 01:10:18.412
Where have you been?

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.982
Have any of these drivers
read the rulebook?

01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:29.361
See? This race is full of cheaters.

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.167
It's tough to see what goes on
in those dust clouds.

01:10:32.336 --> 01:10:34.964
<i>It can get really nasty in there.</i>

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.442
Watch the backdraft.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:45.605
You want some? Come on!
Thor-Azine, yeah!

01:10:45.817 --> 01:10:47.478
Wing left.

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.582
Flying in.

01:10:55.326 --> 01:10:57.521
- Lead them.
- Here you go.

01:10:58.996 --> 01:11:00.020
Ha-ha!

01:11:18.216 --> 01:11:19.911
Watch the blind side!

01:11:28.926 --> 01:11:31.622
Broom Hilda!

01:11:34.298 --> 01:11:38.359
Crom!

01:11:50.047 --> 01:11:51.378
Taejo!

01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:04.921
- Oh, my God, did I just see that?
- A rear single-set jump into a flying kick.

01:12:05.096 --> 01:12:08.088
I know he blew up at Fuji,
but this kid is flat-out magic.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:24.442
I'm going into town for some parts.
I'll be back for lunch.

01:12:24.816 --> 01:12:25.840
Sure thing, Pops.

01:12:28.128 --> 01:12:29.618
Hm? Mm.

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:36.395
Let's go!

01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:41.703
<i>- The Togokahn Team is fighting their way...
- Game on.</i>

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:45.470
<i>... back into the race behind the
electrifying driving of Speed Racer.</i>

01:12:45.645 --> 01:12:47.636
<i>The fans are getting their money's worth.</i>

01:12:47.814 --> 01:12:50.248
Honey, I can't find my wallet.

01:12:50.417 --> 01:12:51.884
Spritle!

01:12:52.052 --> 01:12:54.350
- You two are in big trouble.
- Wait.

01:12:54.521 --> 01:12:56.989
Wait, before you get mad at us, look!

01:12:57.324 --> 01:12:58.791
I'm not falling for that.

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:01.484
- It's Speed!
- Speed's skiing!

01:13:01.828 --> 01:13:03.591
Then who's driving the Mach 5?

01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:06.028
<i>- relentless as the eight remaining teams...</i>

01:13:06.199 --> 01:13:08.963
<i>... slice their way through
the aqueducts of Sassicaia.</i>

01:13:10.537 --> 01:13:11.663
Oh, no.

01:13:11.838 --> 01:13:15.740
As we near the end of the first leg of
the Casa Cristo, one team has dominated.

01:13:15.909 --> 01:13:19.902
And here they come through the streets
of Cortega, heading for the finish.

01:13:24.384 --> 01:13:26.648
Yeah!

01:13:41.034 --> 01:13:44.231
If we drive tomorrow like we drove today,
we will lose!

01:13:45.939 --> 01:13:47.600
You will get nothing.

01:13:48.275 --> 01:13:49.970
All of this will be meaningless!

01:13:50.143 --> 01:13:53.806
Relax. Snake's weak on turns.
We'll catch him in the mountains.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.039
We might, if you stop showing off.

01:13:57.184 --> 01:14:00.017
Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass.

01:14:01.922 --> 01:14:03.981
Don't fall apart yet.

01:14:04.825 --> 01:14:07.020
There's still a lot of race to run.

01:14:14.668 --> 01:14:17.967
A C.I.B. man will be posted
outside your door.

01:14:18.138 --> 01:14:22.973
We got their attention today. You and Trixie
should be very careful tonight.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:25.502
Racer X.

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:28.177
I thought we made a good team today.

01:14:29.449 --> 01:14:32.384
It felt like we've been doing it
for a long time.

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:35.612
If you say so.

01:14:39.793 --> 01:14:43.490
<i>Ineptitude. Is this what I pay you for?!</i>

01:14:43.663 --> 01:14:45.426
They ain't checkered yet.

01:14:45.599 --> 01:14:50.559
If they do, I assure you it'll be
a very costly mistake for everyone.

01:14:51.872 --> 01:14:53.134
It was very weird, Trix.

01:14:53.306 --> 01:14:57.436
I knew every move he was gonna make
and he knew mine. It was so familiar.

01:14:58.979 --> 01:15:03.313
Maybe I'm crazy, but Racer X first
showed up two years after Rex's death.

01:15:03.483 --> 01:15:05.474
But, Speed, we buried Rex.

01:15:05.652 --> 01:15:09.918
A body was buried. Remember, it had
already been badly burned in the crash.

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:12.718
Even if it was Rex,
no one could have recognized him.

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.554
So you think he faked the crash with
a different body in the driver's seat?

01:15:18.732 --> 01:15:21.394
Somehow the kwik-save
was disconnected.

01:15:21.568 --> 01:15:26.801
Inspector Detector suspected foul play,
but nothing could be proved.

01:15:30.343 --> 01:15:33.506
Do you really think Rex
could put everyone through all that?

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:39.313
Maybe he felt
he didn't have any other choice.

01:15:41.588 --> 01:15:44.921
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,
but do you know these people?

01:15:51.097 --> 01:15:52.325
Yeah.

01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:55.860
Is this the kind of driver I have?

01:15:56.036 --> 01:15:58.163
Someone who disobeys?
Someone who lies to me?

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.065
Is this the kind of son I've raised?

01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:02.936
And you, Trixie.

01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:06.211
You know what this race
did to this family.

01:16:06.379 --> 01:16:08.711
Did either of you
stop and think about us?

01:16:08.882 --> 01:16:12.875
That's all I've been thinking about, Pops.
You, Mom, Spritle, Sparky.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.052
Yeah, you too, Chim Chim.

01:16:16.222 --> 01:16:18.952
We're in serious trouble, Pops,
and it's all my fault.

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:21.719
This is not the place or race
to do anything about that.

01:16:21.895 --> 01:16:24.625
- Why not?
- Because it won't do any good.

01:16:24.798 --> 01:16:25.822
You don't know that.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:30.231
You think you can drive a car and change
the world? It doesn't work like that.

01:16:31.905 --> 01:16:33.634
Maybe not.

01:16:33.807 --> 01:16:37.334
But it's the only thing I know how to do,
and I gotta do something.

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:41.336
That's unacceptable. This is over.
Pack your things. We're going home.

01:16:45.585 --> 01:16:47.143
I can't.

01:16:47.821 --> 01:16:48.845
I'm sorry, Pops.

01:16:49.889 --> 01:16:51.186
What?

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:54.383
- I'm staying.
- So am I.

01:16:54.894 --> 01:16:58.728
No, you're not.
We're going home right now!

01:16:59.065 --> 01:17:03.331
I'm not a child, Pops.
You can't tell me how to live my life.

01:17:03.503 --> 01:17:06.165
If you wanna fire me as your driver,
then, fine, do it.

01:17:06.573 --> 01:17:09.565
But it won't change the fact
that I am going to finish this race.

01:17:09.909 --> 01:17:14.039
God, you sound like Rex! You wanna die
like him too? Will that make you happy?

01:17:14.214 --> 01:17:16.944
Don't take it out on me
because you feel guilty for Rex!

01:17:17.117 --> 01:17:19.051
Okay, you two, that's enough.

01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:23.179
Pops. If they're staying, we're staying.

01:17:23.356 --> 01:17:24.914
Woo-hoo! Room service!

01:17:25.258 --> 01:17:30.025
And I suggest that we all find a way
to go home together.

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:38.299
- Where's the Mach 5?
- Logged with security.

01:17:38.471 --> 01:17:41.963
- You added something to it, didn't you?
- Some defensive modifications.

01:17:42.142 --> 01:17:44.702
Whole thing's out of balance, isn't it?

01:17:46.146 --> 01:17:48.376
It pulls left, rides a little stiff.

01:17:48.548 --> 01:17:50.743
- Mmm. Sparky!
- Huh?

01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.217
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:18:01.928 --> 01:18:03.987
Your father loves you. It's just...

01:18:04.164 --> 01:18:05.597
I know.

01:18:07.967 --> 01:18:09.161
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:10.904 --> 01:18:12.667
You wouldn't lie to your mother,
would you?

01:18:13.273 --> 01:18:14.934
Never again.

01:20:23.303 --> 01:20:26.500
I got him, Speed! I got him! I got him!

01:20:33.546 --> 01:20:35.104
Still got him!

01:20:44.357 --> 01:20:45.824
Speed!

01:20:52.532 --> 01:20:53.760
Attack!

01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:57.635
Hi-ya!

01:20:58.972 --> 01:21:00.166
What's going on out there?

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:23.254
Uh-oh.

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:27.092
Ooh!

01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:29.226
You attack my family.

01:21:29.769 --> 01:21:31.760
You try to hurt my sons.

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:36.032
Here we go!

01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:39.442
What's going...?

01:21:43.883 --> 01:21:44.907
Whoa.

01:22:04.103 --> 01:22:05.968
Oh, my God. Was that a ninja?

01:22:06.139 --> 01:22:10.132
More like a non-ja.
Terrible what passes for a ninja these days.

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:12.743
Cool beans.

01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:18.976
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for Speed Racer.

01:22:20.553 --> 01:22:22.453
Horuko. Are you all right?

01:22:22.622 --> 01:22:24.590
No. Something terrible has happened.

01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:29.446
Narcolyte benzamine.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.418
A highly effective and debilitating drug.

01:22:32.589 --> 01:22:35.217
Stays in the system for hours,
but leaves with no trace.

01:22:35.392 --> 01:22:37.917
I'll be fine by morning.

01:22:38.195 --> 01:22:41.824
No, you won't. You can't drive a car.
You can barely stand up.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:47.804
You do not tell me what I can do.

01:22:48.205 --> 01:22:49.229
Taejo.

01:22:52.476 --> 01:22:54.000
What are we gonna do?

01:22:58.782 --> 01:23:01.114
<i>The second leg
of the Casa Cristo is under way...</i>

01:23:01.284 --> 01:23:03.115
<i>... and the stage is set
for what might be...</i>

01:23:03.286 --> 01:23:06.084
<i>... one of the most ferocious rallies
we've seen in years.</i>

01:23:06.256 --> 01:23:08.019
This is my race.

01:23:15.065 --> 01:23:17.033
She's leaving the hotel now.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:22.866
Wicked sidewinder coming up.
Watch the inside-out, could get dicey.

01:23:24.441 --> 01:23:26.204
Watch your line!

01:23:27.477 --> 01:23:28.501
Watch it!

01:23:28.845 --> 01:23:30.073
This is abso...

01:23:30.247 --> 01:23:31.509
- lutely crazy.

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:36.517
Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear.

01:23:45.462 --> 01:23:48.397
Don't do it! On the ground! Now!

01:23:52.969 --> 01:23:54.493
Gotcha.

01:24:00.177 --> 01:24:01.542
What the...?

01:24:04.648 --> 01:24:07.048
You cheater!

01:24:08.685 --> 01:24:12.052
If you're here, who's?

01:24:14.991 --> 01:24:17.755
That's better. I couldn't see a thing.

01:24:19.963 --> 01:24:21.897
That's it. Nice line, Trix.

01:24:22.132 --> 01:24:25.590
Top of the hill's coming up. Snake's
got about a quarter of a mile on you.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:26.963
All right. Let's get him.

01:24:27.137 --> 01:24:29.662
If you'd been more careful,
he wouldn't be ahead.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.900
I told you, I couldn't see a thing
out of this dang helmet.

01:24:34.845 --> 01:24:37.973
I can't believe you talked us into
this ridiculous idea.

01:24:38.148 --> 01:24:39.945
What's ridiculous about it?

01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:43.085
You're always saying
I'm a better driver than most of the WRL.

01:24:43.253 --> 01:24:45.585
- Now's not the time to prove it.
- Why not?

01:24:45.755 --> 01:24:47.245
It's too dangerous.

01:24:47.424 --> 01:24:49.449
It's too dangerous for me,
but not for you?

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:50.991
Children, focus.

01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:55.063
If we're going to have a chance, we'll
have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.

01:24:55.232 --> 01:24:57.632
I'm ready. Let's roll.

01:25:06.676 --> 01:25:09.008
Woo-hoo! Go get them, girl!

01:25:09.579 --> 01:25:11.774
Here they come. Let's pick it up!

01:25:17.254 --> 01:25:19.722
- Take him.
- With pleasure.

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.549
Bring it on!

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.589
Come on!

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:38.302
Now the gloves are off and they're pounding
one another, bumper to bumper, rail to rail.

01:25:45.949 --> 01:25:48.213
Take that, Togokahn!

01:25:52.455 --> 01:25:54.389
You're going down!

01:26:07.904 --> 01:26:09.838
- Oh, yeah!
- That's my boy!

01:26:12.509 --> 01:26:14.238
Oh, God. Speed.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:18.242
Please! Please! Please!

01:26:18.415 --> 01:26:21.873
Oh, please! Please! Aah!

01:26:25.021 --> 01:26:27.012
<i>The Togokahn Team roars into the lead...</i>

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:29.852
...behind some very aggressive driving
by Speed Racer.

01:26:30.026 --> 01:26:32.153
You kidding?
He just tore Snake a new tailpipe.

01:26:32.329 --> 01:26:34.263
Trix, you all right?

01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:36.592
Ten-four. Ready for more.

01:26:36.766 --> 01:26:39.496
Then let's move it.
We've got some time to eat up.

01:26:43.139 --> 01:26:44.606
You're sure, no cameras here?

01:26:44.774 --> 01:26:48.505
No, I checked it this morning. There's quite
a few dead spots in these mountains.

01:26:58.622 --> 01:27:00.180
What's he doing here?

01:27:00.357 --> 01:27:03.224
Stowaway.
We weren't sure what to do with him.

01:27:03.393 --> 01:27:06.385
Do what he'd do.
Break his legs and let him walk back.

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.825
- Thank you so much.
- It was a blast.

01:27:13.003 --> 01:27:15.369
The cell's reloaded.
- Let's go!

01:27:15.538 --> 01:27:16.562
Good luck.

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:23.807
Nobody move.

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.448
Waiting for the Togokahn Team
to come out of the pass.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.210
Those roads can really ice up.
Very dangerous.

01:27:29.386 --> 01:27:32.048
- What is this?
- This...

01:27:32.222 --> 01:27:34.383
...is called a change of plan.

01:27:34.557 --> 01:27:36.286
Yeah, that's right.

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:41.954
We're changing your plan that changed
our plan to change your plan.

01:27:42.532 --> 01:27:43.863
Right, boss?

01:27:44.034 --> 01:27:46.366
The new plan, what was it?

01:27:46.536 --> 01:27:50.597
"Break your legs and make you walk back."
I like that.

01:27:50.774 --> 01:27:54.608
But first, it's time to play
a little game of peekaboo...

01:27:55.445 --> 01:27:57.276
...I see you.

01:28:05.055 --> 01:28:07.751
- Ow!
- Monkey cookie!

01:28:08.191 --> 01:28:10.455
- Nice shot!
- Spritle?

01:28:13.196 --> 01:28:14.823
Get that monkey!

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:33.239
Whoa!

01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:40.017
Ah? Ha!

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:41.714
Aw!

01:28:51.234 --> 01:28:54.465
Hyah! Hyah!

01:29:21.131 --> 01:29:23.531
Nobody messes with Spark...

01:29:35.044 --> 01:29:36.272
Huh?

01:29:53.062 --> 01:29:55.223
Looks like another change of plan.

01:29:59.135 --> 01:30:01.467
Take him away, boys.

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.539
Spritle!

01:30:10.079 --> 01:30:12.172
Go! Go, go!

01:30:13.016 --> 01:30:14.040
No.

01:30:14.217 --> 01:30:16.082
Oh, no, you don't. You're in big trouble.

01:30:16.486 --> 01:30:18.477
<i>First out of the pass is...</i>

01:30:19.689 --> 01:30:20.713
...the Hydra-Cell Team.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:23.085
Uh-oh. They better send
the emergency trailer.

01:30:23.493 --> 01:30:25.188
Wait, is that...?

01:30:25.995 --> 01:30:27.019
Here we go again.

01:30:27.197 --> 01:30:30.257
Whatever happened in that pass
left Togokahn where they started...

01:30:30.433 --> 01:30:34.927
...but now only one obstacle stands
between Snake Oiler and victory.

01:30:35.104 --> 01:30:37.231
The Maltese Ice Caves.

01:30:42.278 --> 01:30:44.439
This is where Rex cr...

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.262
Speed, what are you doing?

01:31:01.431 --> 01:31:03.422
<i>Are you all right?
- I'm fine.</i>

01:31:08.204 --> 01:31:11.367
This next cave's a rattler.
We'll make our move in there.

01:31:15.144 --> 01:31:16.441
Now.

01:31:34.063 --> 01:31:36.497
Ah, not this time, punk.

01:31:47.543 --> 01:31:50.205
Yahoo!

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:51.847
Speed!

01:31:57.086 --> 01:31:59.748
Bye-bye, little turd. Ha-ha-ha!

01:32:19.008 --> 01:32:20.737
He did not! He did not just do that!

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:23.606
Speed Racer is driving straight up
a cliff face. Are we getting this?

01:32:37.593 --> 01:32:39.686
- Come on!
- Go, Speed, go!

01:32:39.862 --> 01:32:42.888
- Hi. Remember me?
- No way.

01:32:55.478 --> 01:32:59.175
No, no, no! Not again! Not again!

01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:00.973
Gun!

01:33:30.546 --> 01:33:33.481
<i>Snake Oiler completely
going out of his mind!</i>

01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:35.913
Could have been altitude sickness.
It gets crazy.

01:33:36.085 --> 01:33:38.019
Speed handled it beautifully.

01:33:38.187 --> 01:33:39.814
And with less than
250 kilometers to go...

01:33:40.089 --> 01:33:43.024
...nothing seems to stand
between Togokahn...

01:33:43.192 --> 01:33:44.989
<i>... and victory.</i>

01:33:53.369 --> 01:33:55.667
Whoo!

01:34:09.118 --> 01:34:11.643
Get me Tetsua Togokahn.

01:34:12.221 --> 01:34:13.711
Whoo!

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:21.963
Thank you.

01:34:23.866 --> 01:34:25.356
Whoo!

01:34:26.102 --> 01:34:28.161
We make a good team.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:34.135
We did our part. Make sure you do yours.

01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:35.971
Of course.

01:34:37.847 --> 01:34:40.873
Congratulations, Mr. Togokahn.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:44.178
<i>- Very impressive race.
- Yes, thank you.</i>

01:34:44.353 --> 01:34:46.719
You're very generous, Mr. Royalton.

01:34:47.256 --> 01:34:50.714
Here's Speed. Does this mean
you've signed with Togokahn?

01:34:50.893 --> 01:34:55.887
Uh, no, this was
a mutually beneficial opportunity.

01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.498
Yes. Well put.

01:34:57.667 --> 01:35:01.694
Taejo, will you be running
in the Grand Prix this weekend?

01:35:02.038 --> 01:35:07.032
We'll see. Right now
I'm just going to enjoy this victory.

01:35:07.844 --> 01:35:09.402
Whoo!

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:15.175
The price is 78 a share.

01:35:16.452 --> 01:35:18.386
That's outrageous.

01:35:18.554 --> 01:35:22.354
The price is barely above 50.
This is extortion, blackmail.

01:35:22.525 --> 01:35:27.326
I'll sue you, tie up every asset you own
for the next 20 years.

01:35:27.497 --> 01:35:30.330
<i>As you wish, Mr. Royalton.
Have a nice day...</i>

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.092
Wait.

01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:37.035
Seventy-eight a share.

01:35:39.675 --> 01:35:41.643
I'll have the paperwork drawn up.

01:35:41.811 --> 01:35:44.871
A pleasure doing business with you.

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:50.544
You have done very well for us, my son.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:03.758
- I don't get it. What just happened?
- Togokahn played us for chumps.

01:36:03.933 --> 01:36:06.868
He wanted our help to drive up
the stock in his family business.

01:36:07.036 --> 01:36:09.436
Even if he had a file,
he wouldn't turn it over.

01:36:09.605 --> 01:36:11.163
You mean the whole race
was for nothing?

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.281
X?

01:37:02.491 --> 01:37:04.118
Racer X.

01:37:04.727 --> 01:37:06.160
Racer X!

01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:18.336
Jesus, kid, you can drive.
I haven't been thrown like that in years.

01:37:18.908 --> 01:37:20.170
What are you doing here?

01:37:21.277 --> 01:37:24.371
The inspector told me what happened.
I came looking for you.

01:37:24.947 --> 01:37:26.244
Why would you care?

01:37:26.415 --> 01:37:29.009
Because you're a fighter and a friend.

01:37:30.586 --> 01:37:33.146
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

01:37:33.522 --> 01:37:37.014
- You're Rex, aren't you?
- You mean your brother?

01:37:37.193 --> 01:37:42.358
You first appeared two years after Rex died.
You drive just like him.

01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:46.661
You knew I'd be here, because this is
where he always used to take me.

01:37:46.836 --> 01:37:48.394
Just tell me the truth.

01:38:04.954 --> 01:38:06.012
You're not Rex.

01:38:06.956 --> 01:38:08.719
No, Speed.

01:38:09.425 --> 01:38:11.916
I'm sorry, but your brother is dead.

01:38:15.931 --> 01:38:18.695
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:22.533
I'm sure if he was here,
he'd be immensely proud of you.

01:38:22.705 --> 01:38:24.502
For what?

01:38:24.874 --> 01:38:26.432
Making the same mistakes he did?

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:28.543
For trying to make a difference.

01:38:28.711 --> 01:38:30.872
From what I've read,
that's all he tried to do.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.943
And what good did it do?
He got killed for nothing.

01:38:35.418 --> 01:38:37.579
Racing hasn't changed and it never will.

01:38:37.753 --> 01:38:40.313
It doesn't matter if racing never changes.

01:38:40.489 --> 01:38:43.481
What matters is if
we let racing change us.

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:49.596
Everyone has to find a reason to do this.
You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver.

01:38:49.765 --> 01:38:51.596
You do it because you're driven.

01:38:52.668 --> 01:38:55.865
If you know so much, why don't you
tell me why I should keep driving?

01:38:56.038 --> 01:38:57.266
Sorry.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.806
That's for you to figure out.

01:39:02.678 --> 01:39:05.146
I just hope when you do...

01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:07.714
...that I'm there to see it.

01:39:18.194 --> 01:39:20.424
- What you doing?
- What's it look like?

01:39:21.764 --> 01:39:22.788
Where you going?

01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:25.531
I don't know.
I just gotta get away from here.

01:39:28.938 --> 01:39:32.465
<i>Can I come with you, Rex?
- What?</i>

01:39:32.641 --> 01:39:34.336
Can we come with you?

01:39:36.812 --> 01:39:39.110
- No.
- Why not?

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:49.586
You'll understand when it's your turn.

01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:53.953
Speed.

01:39:56.065 --> 01:40:00.661
Before you go, I'd like to say a few things.
Will you sit with your old man for a minute?

01:40:02.171 --> 01:40:05.163
- Don't try to stop me.
- I won't.

01:40:13.082 --> 01:40:17.018
Speed, I want you to know
I acted rashly.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.020
I said things I wish I hadn't.

01:40:19.488 --> 01:40:22.719
Your mother usually protects me
from making an ass out of myself...

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:26.885
...but I was determined to do it this time,
and I guess I did a pretty good job of it.

01:40:27.062 --> 01:40:31.021
I just wanted to make sure
you understood how sorry I was.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.667
Thanks.

01:40:32.868 --> 01:40:35.996
The truth was I couldn't have been
more proud of you, son.

01:40:36.172 --> 01:40:40.040
Not because you won, but because
you stood up, you weren't afraid...

01:40:40.209 --> 01:40:42.677
...and you did what you thought
was right.

01:40:42.845 --> 01:40:46.337
It didn't amount to anything.
It was completely meaningless.

01:40:46.515 --> 01:40:48.949
How could it be meaningless?

01:40:49.118 --> 01:40:51.848
I saw my son become a man.

01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:54.148
I watched him act
with courage and integrity...

01:40:54.323 --> 01:40:57.053
...and drive the pants off
every other driver on that road.

01:40:57.226 --> 01:41:01.060
This is not meaningless.
This is a reason for a father's life.

01:41:03.032 --> 01:41:06.001
I went to Cortega because I was
afraid what happened to Rex...

01:41:06.168 --> 01:41:08.966
...was gonna happen to you,
and I just couldn't take that.

01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:11.463
But what I realized at Cortega...

01:41:12.441 --> 01:41:15.569
...was I didn't lose Rex when he crashed.
I lost him here.

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:20.882
I let him think that a stupid motor company
meant more to me than he did.

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.545
He'll never know
how much I regret that mistake.

01:41:26.322 --> 01:41:28.916
It's enough I'll never make it again.

01:41:29.091 --> 01:41:34.654
Speed, I understand that
every child has to leave home...

01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:37.993
...but I want you to know,
that door is always open.

01:41:38.167 --> 01:41:39.634
You can always come back.

01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:43.304
Because I love you.

01:41:45.574 --> 01:41:47.599
I love you, Pops.

01:41:52.848 --> 01:41:55.544
I'm just so confused right now.

01:41:56.151 --> 01:42:01.783
I feel like I'm caught in some kind of
a tailspin and no direction makes sense.

01:42:01.957 --> 01:42:04.118
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:09.898
When Rex died, I didn't know if I wanted
salt on my eggs, let alone keep building cars.

01:42:10.633 --> 01:42:14.501
But then... You remember that night...

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:19.198
...we sat together, we watched old Ben
Burns and Stickleton? You remember that?

01:42:19.775 --> 01:42:22.642
That night, something just clicked.

01:42:22.811 --> 01:42:26.144
Like a light being switched on
inside of me.

01:42:26.315 --> 01:42:29.716
After that, I never had trouble
remembering how I liked my eggs.

01:42:30.486 --> 01:42:34.513
Jeez, Pops, that's just it.
That's part of my problem.

01:42:34.957 --> 01:42:36.390
- What?
- That race...

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:38.990
...the 43 Prix.

01:42:39.428 --> 01:42:42.329
Burns and Stickleton? It was fixed.

01:42:42.798 --> 01:42:45.028
Royalton told me the whole story.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.328
It was all about some DNF named Potts.

01:42:48.637 --> 01:42:52.801
They've known the winner of every Grand
Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed.

01:42:53.075 --> 01:42:54.565
Pfft!

01:42:55.344 --> 01:42:59.474
I don't believe that. Royalton's a crook.
You can't believe a crook.

01:43:00.082 --> 01:43:01.709
I don't think he was lying, Pops.

01:43:02.084 --> 01:43:04.712
The Grand Prix, a sham?

01:43:10.159 --> 01:43:12.684
- Horuko.
- Forgive me for intruding...

01:43:12.861 --> 01:43:15.022
...but I had to come
before it was too late.

01:43:15.864 --> 01:43:16.888
This is not a trick.

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:20.224
I swear to you. I'm not my brother.

01:43:20.502 --> 01:43:23.300
You gonna ask the lovely lady in?

01:43:24.473 --> 01:43:27.601
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

01:43:29.511 --> 01:43:31.706
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.280
My security man believes
I'm still at the opera...

01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:36.847
...so I only have a moment.

01:43:38.053 --> 01:43:40.146
I'm very sorry for what happened.

01:43:40.322 --> 01:43:44.053
What my father and brother did
was not right, and I'm ashamed.

01:43:44.493 --> 01:43:47.519
It's fine. Just another lesson learned.

01:43:47.696 --> 01:43:51.132
No. It is they
who are in need of a lesson.

01:43:51.667 --> 01:43:54.158
This rightfully belongs to you.

01:43:58.974 --> 01:44:02.307
An invitation to compete
in the 91 st annual Grand Prix.

01:44:02.478 --> 01:44:06.278
My brother was planning to decline anyway.
But I studied the rules very carefully.

01:44:06.615 --> 01:44:08.742
And as a member of
the winning Togokahn Team...

01:44:08.917 --> 01:44:13.684
...if you present this invitation on the day of
the race, they must allow you to compete.

01:44:14.323 --> 01:44:17.656
Ha! What do you think of that,
Mr. It's-Always-Fixed?

01:44:18.627 --> 01:44:20.561
- l...
- You don't have to say anything.

01:44:20.729 --> 01:44:23.323
I only hope you drive
as you did in Casa Cristo...

01:44:23.499 --> 01:44:25.763
...and you wipe the smiles
from their faces.

01:44:26.468 --> 01:44:27.799
We don't have a car.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:31.462
- Sparky!
- No. No. He'll yell at me!

01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:36.368
- Right here, Pops.
- What are you doing in the kitchen?

01:44:36.545 --> 01:44:38.479
Same as everyone else.

01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:44.078
I don't believe it.
You were listening the whole time?

01:44:44.253 --> 01:44:47.347
- And I'm so glad I did.
- We were so worried about you.

01:44:48.457 --> 01:44:49.822
Horuko.

01:44:50.659 --> 01:44:51.921
Thank you.

01:44:52.127 --> 01:44:55.358
I would say, "Good luck Saturday,"
but you don't need it.

01:44:55.531 --> 01:44:58.762
You're already very lucky
to have such a family.

01:44:59.735 --> 01:45:02.966
- Come on, we got work to do.
- The race is less than two days away.

01:45:03.138 --> 01:45:06.505
How fast did Royalton say he could build
that tin can with his machines?

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:07.699
Thirty-six hours.

01:45:07.876 --> 01:45:11.209
Then we'll do it in 32. Come on, let's go.

01:46:06.502 --> 01:46:08.094
Cameraman.

01:46:30.759 --> 01:46:35.856
Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future!

01:46:40.302 --> 01:46:42.202
Sparky? You ready?

01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:45.600
Ready, Pops.

01:46:48.076 --> 01:46:50.704
Pops, that's a Bernoulli Convergenator.

01:46:50.879 --> 01:46:55.009
Transponder schmonder.
You want real kick, you go Bernoulli.

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:00.752
Were you here last year?

01:47:00.923 --> 01:47:02.720
- Yes, you were.
- No.

01:47:08.263 --> 01:47:11.960
The Colosseum has begun to fill,
final preparations are under way.

01:47:12.134 --> 01:47:15.433
We're expecting the largest television
audience in Grand Prix history.

01:47:15.604 --> 01:47:18.835
<i>We've got an incredible lineup
this year, like the Grey Ghost...</i>

01:47:19.007 --> 01:47:23.842
<i>... Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi, Nitro
Venderhoss and The Scarlet Valentine.</i>

01:47:24.012 --> 01:47:25.070
Not to mention C-Ball.

01:47:25.247 --> 01:47:27.807
Cannonball Taylor,
fastest Grand Prix seed in history...

01:47:27.983 --> 01:47:31.783
<i>... driving the new GRX
from Royalton Race Cars.</i>

01:47:46.268 --> 01:47:49.032
- Thanks, doll.
- You're welcome.

01:47:49.204 --> 01:47:52.537
<i>We've got an odd-numbered field
this year, one shy of a full boat...</i>

01:47:52.708 --> 01:47:57.839
<i>... as Taejo Togokahn declined his automatic
invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.</i>

01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:03.541
All right, let's start her up.

01:48:06.955 --> 01:48:08.513
Sounds beefy, Pops.

01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:11.488
Yeah, I gave it a little something extra.

01:48:13.762 --> 01:48:15.662
Come on, let's load it up.

01:48:15.831 --> 01:48:19.597
Hold on.
Something's going on over there.

01:48:19.768 --> 01:48:22.965
We're seeing some kind of commotion
down at the trailer entrance.

01:48:28.777 --> 01:48:30.677
Excuse me.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.575
Is there a problem here, officer?

01:48:35.851 --> 01:48:38.513
Why, you sly dog.

01:48:38.854 --> 01:48:41.721
Sir, we have a problem.

01:48:42.057 --> 01:48:43.718
Excuse me.

01:48:43.926 --> 01:48:46.121
What madness is going on here?

01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:50.024
Mr. Royalton, this is a legitimate invitation.
We have verified it.

01:48:52.467 --> 01:48:55.664
- Where did you get this?
- I won it fair and square.

01:48:56.939 --> 01:48:59.965
This is preposterous. He can't
be allowed to race. It's too late.

01:49:00.142 --> 01:49:02.235
The ruling on this is clear.
Try to stop it...

01:49:02.411 --> 01:49:05.175
...and you'll be in blatant violation
of the WRL charter...

01:49:05.347 --> 01:49:08.111
...leaving me no option
but to shut this year's Prix down...

01:49:08.283 --> 01:49:10.410
...until a full investigation
can be completed.

01:49:10.585 --> 01:49:15.716
What? Have you any idea what
that would cost? Are you insane?

01:49:15.891 --> 01:49:16.915
Try me.

01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:20.926
Something big is going on
because every race official has...

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:23.564
Wait, wait, an announcement
is being made.

01:49:23.732 --> 01:49:26.064
<i>Now driving in the 40th and final position...</i>

01:49:26.234 --> 01:49:27.360
<i>Holy sh * *!</i>

01:49:27.736 --> 01:49:31.763
<i>... for Racer Motors in the Mach 6,
Speed Racer.</i>

01:49:38.046 --> 01:49:41.846
A million dollars to the driver
that takes out Racer.

01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:44.948
He won't even get out of the blocks.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:49.283
I'd prefer him to not even
make it out of the locker room.

01:49:52.694 --> 01:49:55.891
We're installing a spearhook in the GRX.

01:49:56.064 --> 01:49:58.464
I don't need one to beat that punk.

01:50:00.469 --> 01:50:02.130
A precaution.

01:50:02.838 --> 01:50:04.601
<i>As the cars take to the field...</i>

01:50:04.773 --> 01:50:08.470
...you can feel the anticipation
mounting in the audience.

01:50:08.643 --> 01:50:10.804
<i>Something is different.</i>

01:50:10.979 --> 01:50:12.776
<i>There's an electricity in the air.</i>

01:50:12.948 --> 01:50:15.007
<i>The presence of Speed Racer...</i>

01:50:15.183 --> 01:50:19.017
<i>... has completely changed the equation.</i>

01:50:33.535 --> 01:50:35.025
How are you feeling?

01:50:37.506 --> 01:50:39.064
It's big.

01:50:41.843 --> 01:50:44.710
That cockpit is the exact same size
it was at Thunderhead.

01:50:46.548 --> 01:50:47.810
Right.

01:50:50.118 --> 01:50:52.052
I wanna say thank you...

01:50:52.921 --> 01:50:56.186
...for what could be the most exciting
moment in my whole life.

01:50:56.358 --> 01:50:58.553
Couldn't have gotten here without you.

01:51:04.833 --> 01:51:08.667
- I'm looking forward to that cold milk.
- Me too.

01:51:14.176 --> 01:51:18.169
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!</i>

01:51:24.152 --> 01:51:25.915
<i>The final countdown has begun...</i>

01:51:26.488 --> 01:51:28.956
...and a stillness
has fallen over this stadium...

01:51:29.124 --> 01:51:32.958
...as all eyes turn to one car.

01:51:39.668 --> 01:51:41.192
<i>Ten.</i>

01:51:44.973 --> 01:51:49.205
This ain't a race, this is a showdown.

01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:12.059
Trouble at the start. A misfire traps
Speed Racer, causing a collision.

01:52:12.234 --> 01:52:13.565
Uh-oh. Look out.

01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:23.100
Ooh, that kid is wily!

01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:25.212
<i>I don't know how he got out of that one.</i>

01:52:58.847 --> 01:53:00.405
Nice, nice.

01:53:00.582 --> 01:53:04.279
<i>Speed Racer blows by Katsu
Toppledama, charging into the Moguls.</i>

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.683
<i>He's taking on all comers.</i>

01:53:06.855 --> 01:53:09.050
<i>Kelly Kellencoff makes a move,
cuts him off!</i>

01:53:09.224 --> 01:53:11.920
<i>Ah, big mistake!
- Speed fakes left, jumps right.</i>

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:13.852
<i>He slips in behind Gearbox.</i>

01:53:14.029 --> 01:53:16.088
Here comes over-under.

01:53:24.005 --> 01:53:25.199
I told you! I told you!

01:53:25.373 --> 01:53:30.208
Speed Racer seems unstoppable, moving up
from dead last, nearing the leaders.

01:53:35.083 --> 01:53:36.311
Go, Speed, go!

01:54:19.527 --> 01:54:22.826
But look out. As they approach
the Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer.

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:09.376
Speed Racer is knocking on the door
of Cannonball Taylor.

01:55:09.544 --> 01:55:12.012
"Yoo-hoo, anybody home?"

01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:20.083
Okay, Mr. Two-Time-Grand-Prix-
Five-Time-WRL-Future-Hall-of-Fame...

01:55:20.255 --> 01:55:21.620
...teach me something.

01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:29.927
You ready?

01:55:30.098 --> 01:55:31.827
- Ha-ha.
- Let's go.

01:55:41.676 --> 01:55:43.473
Get that weak shit off my track.

01:55:54.122 --> 01:55:55.555
Come on, that move is weak.

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.019
Cannonball Taylor's in trouble.

01:56:05.934 --> 01:56:08.129
Tear him up, kid, tear him up.

01:56:20.949 --> 01:56:22.678
Come on, is that all you got?

01:56:31.326 --> 01:56:34.193
Lesson's over. See you at the finish line.

01:56:36.531 --> 01:56:39.364
Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.

01:56:47.809 --> 01:56:49.401
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

01:56:49.577 --> 01:56:51.704
Spearhook! He's got me.

01:56:52.981 --> 01:56:57.008
<i>Cannonball has Speed pinned
as they grind through the butterfly turn.</i>

01:56:57.185 --> 01:57:00.621
That cheater. He's using a spearhook!

01:57:40.328 --> 01:57:43.593
Cannonball clearly using a spearhook.

01:57:43.798 --> 01:57:45.527
That could cost him the hall of fame.

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:47.759
<i>Not to mention what it'll do
to Royalton Industries.</i>

01:57:47.936 --> 01:57:49.335
<i>Shame on them.</i>

01:57:55.977 --> 01:57:58.275
Oh, no, no, no, don't do this!

01:57:58.446 --> 01:58:02.610
- The Triple Phase Conductor's fried.
- Sparky, get me back in this race.

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:08.453
- What's wrong?
- The crash must've dislodged the conductor.

01:58:08.623 --> 01:58:09.647
Starter's overloaded.

01:58:14.696 --> 01:58:18.223
- The nickelhydrate cells are hemorrhaging.
- What do I do?

01:58:18.399 --> 01:58:20.162
Don't panic.

01:58:20.735 --> 01:58:23.295
Just listen, Speed. Just listen to her.

01:58:23.471 --> 01:58:27.134
- If I could defibrillate the...
- Shh. Sparky. Give me a second.

01:58:31.379 --> 01:58:32.676
Is there anything he can do?

01:58:32.847 --> 01:58:35.372
I ran a patch through the starter
to the Convergenator.

01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:38.485
If he puts the car in fifth gear,
he could jump-start it.

01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:39.779
Will he know that?

01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:43.316
Would Sparky?

01:58:47.862 --> 01:58:49.830
What do you need?

01:59:05.613 --> 01:59:06.671
He's back in it!

01:59:13.288 --> 01:59:14.346
Come on, kid, move it!

01:59:17.825 --> 01:59:19.087
He's gonna do it.

01:59:20.194 --> 01:59:21.957
<i>I don't know why I'm doing it anymore.</i>

01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:24.963
You don't climb into a T-180
to be a driver.

01:59:25.266 --> 01:59:27.734
<i>You do it because you're driven.</i>

01:59:28.202 --> 01:59:30.500
<i>Racing has nothing to do
with cars or drivers.</i>

01:59:30.672 --> 01:59:32.663
<i>You ready to put away your toys
and grow up?</i>

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.138
Are you ready to become
a real racecar driver?

01:59:36.811 --> 01:59:40.747
Look at the split.
He's shattering the lap record.

01:59:40.915 --> 01:59:43.816
<i>If you know so much,
tell me why I should keep driving.</i>

01:59:44.052 --> 01:59:45.485
That's for you to figure out.

01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.988
<i>I just hope when you do...</i>

01:59:48.823 --> 01:59:50.313
...that I'm there to see it.

01:59:57.432 --> 02:00:00.162
<i>When I watch you do
some of the things you do...</i>

02:00:03.338 --> 02:00:05.135
...when you just take my breath away.

02:00:13.281 --> 02:00:14.373
You remember that night?

02:00:14.549 --> 02:00:17.518
<i>We sat together, we watched
old Ben Burns and Stickleton.</i>

02:00:17.685 --> 02:00:19.414
<i>That night, something just...</i>

02:00:20.054 --> 02:00:21.453
...clicked.

02:00:30.531 --> 02:00:33.261
<i>Racing hasn't changed and it never will.</i>

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:41.905
<i>It doesn't matter
if racing never changes. What matters...</i>

02:00:42.076 --> 02:00:44.101
...is if we let racing change us.

02:00:49.283 --> 02:00:53.617
<i>When I'm in a T- 180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.</i>

02:00:54.689 --> 02:00:57.055
No hesitation. Nothing fazes him.

02:00:57.225 --> 02:00:59.159
<i>No one seems capable of stopping him.</i>

02:00:59.327 --> 02:01:00.351
He's on a mission.

02:01:00.528 --> 02:01:03.053
With a quarter-lap to go,
Speed Racer is back.

02:01:04.632 --> 02:01:06.896
<i>Two cars between him and destiny.</i>

02:01:07.068 --> 02:01:10.060
Stop him!

02:01:10.471 --> 02:01:12.336
Here we go again.

02:01:28.489 --> 02:01:29.581
Yes!

02:01:49.343 --> 02:01:50.867
Speed Racer!

02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:59.742
<i>It's pandemonium.
People here have gone completely crazy.</i>

02:03:00.047 --> 02:03:03.073
In 14 years, we've never
seen anything like this.

02:03:03.384 --> 02:03:06.615
It's a whole new world, baby.
It's a whole new world.

02:03:44.158 --> 02:03:46.092
He did it.

02:03:47.395 --> 02:03:50.660
- Yes, he did.
- This could change everything.

02:03:51.933 --> 02:03:53.195
It already has.

02:03:56.037 --> 02:03:59.996
My men are bringing the family down.
Do you wanna go with them?

02:04:03.177 --> 02:04:04.610
No.

02:04:06.681 --> 02:04:08.876
Can I ask you a question?

02:04:09.851 --> 02:04:13.343
Did you ever think you made a mistake,
hiding the truth from them?

02:05:01.602 --> 02:05:03.433
If I did...

02:05:05.139 --> 02:05:07.699
...it's a mistake I have to live with.

02:05:20.321 --> 02:05:21.618
Whoa!

02:05:21.789 --> 02:05:22.847
Speed!

02:05:45.046 --> 02:05:46.707
Speed!

02:05:51.185 --> 02:05:54.245
Thank you, Speed. I love you, sweetie.

02:05:54.422 --> 02:05:56.583
That was so beautiful.

02:05:56.757 --> 02:05:58.190
I'm proud of you, son.

02:06:10.871 --> 02:06:15.001
Warning: The following image may be
unsuitable for the uninoculated...
