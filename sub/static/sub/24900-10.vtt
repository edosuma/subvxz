Let's see how you handle this!

00:38.452 --> 00:39.901
Aah!

00:39.936 --> 00:40.971
I got it!

00:41.006 --> 00:43.043
Oof!

00:44.216 --> 00:45.286
No goal!

00:45.321 --> 00:47.737
What?! I bent time and space

00:47.771 --> 00:49.049
just to get that shot!

00:49.083 --> 00:50.050
Exactly.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.190
Because you broke
the laws of physics,

00:52.224 --> 00:53.363
Bubbles gets
a free shot.

00:53.398 --> 00:55.434
Yay! Free!

00:55.469 --> 00:58.955
G-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o, Bubbles!

01:01.337 --> 01:02.821
Aww.

01:07.412 --> 01:09.241
Goal!

01:09.276 --> 01:11.174
Yay!
What?!

01:13.590 --> 01:16.662
It is I!
Erica the red!

01:16.697 --> 01:19.734
Most excellent
and violent warrior!

01:19.769 --> 01:23.807
Victor of the ancient
battlefields of Galhalla!

01:23.842 --> 01:26.086
And three-time
bowling champion...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.777
...with perfect score!

01:27.811 --> 01:30.435
Erica, what are
you doing here?

01:30.469 --> 01:34.473
Tiny warriors,
I come with a warning!

01:34.508 --> 01:36.682
After a long day of battle,

01:36.717 --> 01:38.753
I was having most
delicious dinner

01:38.788 --> 01:41.929
with our top prophet,
Trisha the Grey,

01:41.963 --> 01:46.416
when she was struck with
a horrible vision of the future.

01:46.451 --> 01:47.417
Pew!

01:48.798 --> 01:53.285
"A Great Evil shall
arise in Townsville!"

01:54.217 --> 01:59.049
So, I come to Townsville
to destroy "great evil"...

01:59.084 --> 02:02.052
And to ask the greatest
tiny warrior

02:02.087 --> 02:06.954
to fight alongside me
in most extreme battle!

02:06.988 --> 02:09.163
Well, you came
to the right -- Oof!

02:09.198 --> 02:10.371
Not you.

02:10.406 --> 02:12.477
Tiny warrior Bubbles!

02:12.511 --> 02:14.893
G-o-o-o-o-o, Bubbles!

02:14.927 --> 02:15.997
Oh!

02:17.896 --> 02:19.069
I'm okay!

02:19.104 --> 02:22.521
What?! I'm twice the legendary
warrior she is!

02:22.556 --> 02:25.145
Erica, if there's danger
facing Townsville,

02:25.179 --> 02:27.285
then the Powerpuff Girls
are ready to fight

02:27.319 --> 02:28.493
alongside you!

02:28.527 --> 02:30.805
All of us!Very well.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.635
But first
you must take

02:32.669 --> 02:37.295
the oath of the most
extreme warrior!

02:37.329 --> 02:39.055
Sounds cool.

02:39.089 --> 02:42.023
Now, raise
your svarlesborg!

02:44.578 --> 02:48.098
Speak with me in the most
righteous fashion!

02:48.133 --> 02:53.587
"I vow to fight alongside
my most cool fellow warriors,

02:53.621 --> 02:56.176
until the Great Evil
is destroyed

02:56.210 --> 03:02.251
or I myself am sliced into
tiny bits and fed to a dragon!

03:06.703 --> 03:08.947
It is done!

03:08.981 --> 03:12.192
We won't really be eaten
by a dragon, will we?

03:14.263 --> 03:16.023
Tiny pigtailed warrior!

03:16.057 --> 03:18.853
You make me laugh,
acting scared

03:18.888 --> 03:22.029
when you are clearly
the toughest fighter here!

03:23.375 --> 03:29.243
Now! Let us make with the
hunting of "the Great Evil"!

03:29.278 --> 03:30.244
Aaaah!

03:30.279 --> 03:32.246
Ha!

03:33.730 --> 03:36.146
Wow. Nice car!

03:36.181 --> 03:37.251
Thanks!

03:37.286 --> 03:39.529
Spent my life savings
customizing it.

03:39.564 --> 03:41.048
Aaah!

03:41.082 --> 03:44.638
Great Evil!
I will destroy you!

03:47.261 --> 03:50.230
Your entire
life savings, huh?

03:50.264 --> 03:52.093
Yeah.

03:52.128 --> 03:54.889
The "Great Evil"
was a car?

03:54.924 --> 03:57.616
Maybe. Or maybe...

03:57.651 --> 03:59.342
That is Great Evil!

04:00.964 --> 04:01.827
Aaaah!

04:01.862 --> 04:04.105
Taste my blade!

04:11.975 --> 04:15.151
Erica!
That's just ice cream!

04:15.185 --> 04:16.670
Hmm?

04:18.947 --> 04:20.190
Hmm.

04:20.225 --> 04:22.331
It was just ice cream...

04:22.365 --> 04:23.573
this time.

04:23.608 --> 04:25.782
Well, maybe we can help.

04:25.817 --> 04:27.508
What does the Great Evil
look like?

04:27.543 --> 04:28.923
Ahem...

04:28.958 --> 04:32.858
A true warrior never
asks questions, right, Erica?

04:32.893 --> 04:34.653
No, weak
pointy haired one!

04:34.688 --> 04:37.311
The pigtailed
warrior is right!

04:37.346 --> 04:38.416
Hmm? Aah!

04:38.450 --> 04:40.314
Ooh. Hm.

04:40.349 --> 04:44.007
A true warrior always asks
most extreme questions

04:44.042 --> 04:46.113
like "who should
I destroy next?"

04:46.147 --> 04:49.012
and "what is the best part
of my opponent to stab?"

04:49.047 --> 04:52.809
You have no idea what the
Great Evil looks like, do you?

04:52.844 --> 04:55.364
I will know it when I see it.

04:55.398 --> 04:58.298
There! The Great Evil!

04:58.332 --> 04:59.816
Ahhhhh!

04:59.851 --> 05:01.231
Take that,
Great Evil!

05:01.266 --> 05:04.373
And that! And that!
And that! And that!

05:04.407 --> 05:05.857
And tha-a-a-a-a-t!

05:08.894 --> 05:10.655
Girls, we have
a problem.

05:10.689 --> 05:12.346
Erica the Red is crazy!

05:12.381 --> 05:13.658
Tell me about it!

05:13.692 --> 05:16.074
She thinks Bubbles
is the toughest fighter!

05:16.108 --> 05:18.007
♪ La La La La Laaaa!

05:18.041 --> 05:19.733
♪ La La La La Laaaa!

05:19.767 --> 05:22.149
No. I mean,
Erica's crazy

05:22.183 --> 05:25.325
and we have to stop her
before she destroys Townsville!

05:25.359 --> 05:26.360
A-ha!

05:27.396 --> 05:29.812
The Great Evil,
I can smell it.

05:29.846 --> 05:31.538
It is in there!

05:31.572 --> 05:32.884
Aaah!

05:34.023 --> 05:35.231
Wait!

05:35.265 --> 05:39.546
Another
boring day at the office.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.859
Great Evil!

05:44.758 --> 05:48.175
Prepare to meet
your Schmeetz Mooven!

05:48.209 --> 05:51.074
Yeah, like I haven't
heard that one before!

05:51.109 --> 05:52.524
Aaaah!

05:52.559 --> 05:55.009
No!

05:55.044 --> 05:58.358
Typical Monday.

06:00.532 --> 06:03.293
You have stopped me
from defeating Great Evil.

06:03.328 --> 06:07.781
You have broken most sacred oath
of the most extreme warrior.

06:07.815 --> 06:11.198
In Galhalla, we have
a word for that...

06:11.232 --> 06:12.751
Uncool!

06:12.786 --> 06:15.409
Erica, you can't
hurt the mayor.

06:15.444 --> 06:17.377
Pigtailed warrior?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.103
Even you make with
the betraying?

06:20.138 --> 06:23.210
I would expect this from
the cowardly green one.

06:23.244 --> 06:24.522
But you?

06:24.556 --> 06:25.592
What?!

06:25.626 --> 06:27.214
I demand
you release me!

06:27.248 --> 06:30.700
We will let you go if you
promise not to harm the mayor.

06:30.735 --> 06:31.805
Very well.

06:31.839 --> 06:34.911
I will not destroy
this may-ore.

06:34.946 --> 06:36.982
I will destroy you!

06:37.017 --> 06:38.398
Ooh!

06:38.432 --> 06:39.537
Whoa!
Let me go!

06:39.571 --> 06:41.711
I must destroy
Great Evil!

06:41.746 --> 06:44.438
Another day
in public service.

06:44.473 --> 06:47.786
I got a package here
for one Mr. "The Mayor."

06:47.821 --> 06:51.894
Sweet salami!
Finally something exciting!

06:51.928 --> 06:53.758
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

06:56.139 --> 06:57.244
Hm?

06:57.278 --> 06:58.348
I don't
remember ordering

06:58.383 --> 07:00.074
a mystical
demonic trumpet,

07:00.109 --> 07:01.800
but, uh, oh well.

07:01.835 --> 07:03.423
Free shipping.

07:05.632 --> 07:07.772
Huh? Pickles?

07:07.806 --> 07:09.359
Hm. It's been awhile.

07:10.982 --> 07:13.916
Let's see if I can still
blow some hot licks!

07:16.125 --> 07:18.817
Oh, yeah, still got it.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.797
A Giant Evil lava monster?

07:32.831 --> 07:34.281
Let's go.

07:34.315 --> 07:36.179
Wait!
Maybe it's one of those

07:36.214 --> 07:38.596
good Giant Evil
lava monsters.

07:44.878 --> 07:46.293
Maybe that was
an accident.

07:48.985 --> 07:49.952
Maybe --

07:52.541 --> 07:55.060
Look who's come
barturging back.

07:55.095 --> 07:58.719
Erica, the Great Evil is here,
and it's too powerful!

07:58.754 --> 07:59.858
You have to help us!

07:59.893 --> 08:01.964
Never.
Once an oath breaker,

08:01.998 --> 08:04.311
always an oath breaker!

08:04.345 --> 08:07.348
All we did was question you
about hurting the mayor!

08:07.383 --> 08:09.143
And didn't you say the code of

08:09.178 --> 08:12.319
the most extreme
warrior states...

08:12.353 --> 08:15.495
"A true warrior always asks

08:15.529 --> 08:18.359
most extreme questions"?

08:18.394 --> 08:21.535
Hmm. You may be
wimpy of fist,

08:21.570 --> 08:24.573
but I see that you are
clearly the smart one!

08:24.607 --> 08:26.022
Hey!

08:26.057 --> 08:29.163
Release me, and we will
destroy the Great Evil

08:29.198 --> 08:31.821
with most
excellent violence!

08:31.856 --> 08:33.236
Okay!

08:36.032 --> 08:37.758
Let's go, girls!

08:37.793 --> 08:39.173
Wait!

08:39.207 --> 08:42.900
If we are to battle,
we must do so with honor.

08:42.936 --> 08:45.179
Raise your svarlesborg!

08:45.214 --> 08:47.734
Do you agree
to fight alongside

08:47.768 --> 08:50.184
my most cool
fellow warriors,

08:50.219 --> 08:53.843
but if a warrior
is acting most uncool

08:53.878 --> 08:55.914
then we shall
talk with them?

08:55.949 --> 08:57.019
We do.

08:57.053 --> 08:58.123
It is done.

08:58.158 --> 08:59.469
What's that oath called?

08:59.504 --> 09:00.678
I made it up.

09:00.712 --> 09:04.405
Just for us, for we are
better than warriors!

09:04.440 --> 09:05.303
We are...

09:05.337 --> 09:07.857
Friend warriors!

09:09.238 --> 09:11.551
For Galhalla!
Ooh!

09:11.585 --> 09:13.483
Yo, flame brain!

09:13.518 --> 09:15.762
Let's rumble!

09:15.796 --> 09:17.039
Aah!

09:17.073 --> 09:18.385
Yeah! Let's...

09:18.419 --> 09:19.420
Ugh!

09:19.455 --> 09:22.009
Try picking on
someone your own...

09:22.838 --> 09:24.253
...size.

09:24.287 --> 09:25.323
Ugh!

09:25.357 --> 09:27.981
The Great Evil is
a most worthy foe.

09:28.015 --> 09:30.570
It's too strong!
What do we do?

09:30.604 --> 09:34.884
I must summon the most powerful,
legendary sword,

09:34.919 --> 09:36.955
the Endbringer!

09:36.990 --> 09:40.234
Now that's what
I'm talking about, bay-bee!

09:40.269 --> 09:42.789
Forged in the fires
of Flamebear...

09:42.823 --> 09:46.344
wielded by the Yeti Knights
of the Glacierfall,

09:46.378 --> 09:50.624
honed by the jungle beasts
of Fang Alley.

09:50.659 --> 09:54.801
I summon the Endbringer!

10:01.497 --> 10:03.603
Whoa.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.746
That's your
legendary sword?

10:08.780 --> 10:11.093
Don't worry.
It's very sharp.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.164
But I need
to get close.

10:13.198 --> 10:15.200
No problem, Erica.

10:15.235 --> 10:18.997
Okay, girls,
plan Ram Rod.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.932
Mmmmm...

10:24.969 --> 10:28.110
Hey, Mr. Great Evil...

10:30.146 --> 10:33.046
For Galhalla!

10:33.080 --> 10:34.634
Erica!

10:39.328 --> 10:42.227
Victory! She is ours!

10:42.262 --> 10:43.643
You were awesome!

10:43.677 --> 10:45.127
Weare awesome.

10:45.161 --> 10:46.887
For we are...

10:46.922 --> 10:49.407
Friend warriors!

10:50.615 --> 10:52.686
Huh. This is the last time
I order something

10:52.721 --> 10:55.724
from Discount Cheap Things
Warehouse.

10:56.932 --> 10:59.003
Come in!

10:59.037 --> 11:01.419
Yeah, anyone here
order some pickles?
