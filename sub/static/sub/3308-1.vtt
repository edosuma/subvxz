<i>Rioters have filled
in the streets...</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:12.519
<i>...it's the fourth wave of riots...</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:17.767
<i>This evening martial law has been
declared throughout the country.</i>

00:17.768 --> 00:20.191
<i>No one shall be allowed

00:23.565 --> 00:27.945
<i>The assembly of governors have
declared war is imminent.</i>

Pu-jo.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.966
Ahh.

03:37.467 --> 03:42.518
Scouts from the Uroku
Kingdom mapping our land.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.728
And their preparation has begun.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.281
Gather all the clans.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.236
It's time.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.652
<i>Cage of the Lost Clan,</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:22.279
<i>the Ninja Council
requests your presence</i>

05:22.280 --> 05:24.874
<i>for a peace summit at
the Warlord's Temple</i>

05:24.875 --> 05:27.619
<i>in the Great Eastern Mountains.</i>

05:52.519 --> 05:55.688
<i>Choose four of your
finest to accompany you.</i>

05:55.689 --> 05:59.525
<i>They should have honor
and live by the Code.</i>

05:59.526 --> 06:05.624
<i>For it will be they who help usher in
a new era of peace among our kind.</i>

06:19.129 --> 06:24.510
<i>A new age that will provide safety
and security for our families.</i>

06:37.731 --> 06:40.154
<i>So, bring your strongest,</i>

06:42.485 --> 06:44.737
<i>your smartest,</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:52.328
<i>your fiercest,</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:57.925
<i>and your most talented.</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:36.372
<i>May your journey be swift.</i>

07:49.302 --> 07:51.679
There we go.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.436
<i>And may wisdom be your guide.</i>

08:57.370 --> 08:59.038
Remember, this is a peace summit.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.667
Leave your weapons behind.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.739
<i>The education system
of our ancestors</i>

09:33.740 --> 09:36.992
was they actually had to go
into a room and read stuff.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.578
Yeah, nothing was
downloadable back then.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.083
They had to go and memorize things.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.362
Is that Becker?

10:06.064 --> 10:08.066
This doesn't look good.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.985
Keep them close,

10:11.986 --> 10:14.279
and stay by me.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.703
What about our weapons?

10:26.793 --> 10:29.716
It's a peace summit, guys.

10:35.385 --> 10:40.128
Fumitaka must be hard
up if he's invited the...

10:40.654 --> 10:42.884
Lost Clan.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.310
Tell me,

10:45.311 --> 10:48.906
is it that you've lost your way

10:50.733 --> 10:53.068
or lost your honor?

10:53.069 --> 10:56.155
This is a peace summit.

10:56.156 --> 11:01.162
The Lost Honor Clan makes
much more sense to me now.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.291
Hey.

11:07.292 --> 11:11.211
It's the big deaf and dumb guy.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.510
How is life

11:18.845 --> 11:21.188
with the honorless?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.611
Feel more at home there?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.195
Answer me, you big freak.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.627
- Honor the Code.
- Your code.

11:50.043 --> 11:54.551
What they say about you is only
partly right. I know the truth.

11:56.382 --> 12:00.386
You are a liar

12:01.346 --> 12:03.894
and a coward.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.986
No fighting. We're here
for a peace summit.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.906
You must put your petty
differences aside.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.076
Master Fumitaka has ordered it.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.749
Now.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.501
Cage

12:32.502 --> 12:35.551
of the Lost Clan.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.759
How have you been?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.433
Surviving.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.182
Surviving? Come on.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.309
It's time to flourish.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.522
Master Fumitaka will be
very pleased to see you.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.867
It's been way too long, brother.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.784
No weapons in the bunker.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.375
Relinquish them. Now.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.791
- Who's Captain Uptight over there?
- Hiroshi.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.752
We trained together
under Master Fumitaka.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.880
He was chosen as a Master's second.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.092
Over you?

13:22.093 --> 13:25.517
I guess you can't be given
everything, can you, little brother?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.589
How far down does this thing go?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.634
These old bunkers sometimes
went 100 floors down.

14:45.635 --> 14:49.137
Thousands of feet into the earth.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.265
People lived down here
after the Great War.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.440
Protected them from the fallout.

15:01.709 --> 15:04.378
<i>Only the 20th floor?</i>

15:04.779 --> 15:08.452
I usually like my peace summits
at least 50 floors down.

15:08.453 --> 15:11.919
No one has ever come back
from the lower floors alive.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.165
Ooh.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.251
Follow me.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.465
Clan leaders,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.134
I am honored to present to you

16:09.135 --> 16:12.971
our revered master, Fumitaka.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.988
Brothers.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.907
Sisters.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.868
Fellow ninja warriors.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.543
<i>Look at us.</i>

16:39.874 --> 16:43.594
Leaders of the great clans
standing side by side.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.715
Each powerful in his own right.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.260
<i>Each unique with his own gift.</i>

16:52.261 --> 16:56.723
The Southern Clan with
their fire-throwers.

16:56.724 --> 17:01.937
<i>The haunting Specters
of the Eastern Sea.</i>

17:01.938 --> 17:06.608
Mighty Desert Dragons with
an even mightier bite.

17:08.569 --> 17:14.866
The Sirens with their deadly
yet irresistible allure.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.162
Even the mysterious Lost Clan

17:19.163 --> 17:21.882
<i>has come from afar.</i>

17:29.173 --> 17:32.222
Brothers and sisters,

17:33.094 --> 17:35.929
I come to you with grave news

17:35.930 --> 17:38.103
<i>that threatens our
very way of life.</i>

17:38.104 --> 17:42.143
We must come together
as one clan today.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.241
Silence.

17:52.071 --> 17:56.199
I declare a year of truce.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.910
No clan may harm another clan.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.664
No ninja may harm another ninja.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.916
<i>Violation of this truce</i>

18:04.917 --> 18:08.216
will be punishable by death.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.805
He was caught scouting our woods.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.224
The Uroku Kingdom is
building an army.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.102
<i>They will attack soon.</i>

18:24.103 --> 18:28.106
One by one we would have fallen.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.151
But, my brothers and sisters,

18:31.152 --> 18:33.278
<i>together as one clan,</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:37.454
<i>we are unbeatable.</i>

18:40.369 --> 18:43.246
<i>We are bound by the Code.</i>

18:43.247 --> 18:46.249
Code of the Clan.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.002
Who will stand with me?

18:53.049 --> 18:56.393
Fumitaka. Fumitaka.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.314
Fumitaka. Fumitaka.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.018
Fumitaka. Fumitaka.

19:05.019 --> 19:09.022
Fumitaka. Fumitaka. Fumitaka.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.733
On this day,

19:11.734 --> 19:16.910
let the peace begin now.

19:21.494 --> 19:26.670
Fumitaka. Fumitaka. Fumitaka.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.841
Master?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.346
Master.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.268
It was that one.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.269
<i>From the Lost Clan.</i>

19:48.270 --> 19:51.147
It was him. I saw him throw it.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.108
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

19:53.109 --> 19:55.277
The one called Cage.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.121
Get us the hell out of here.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.871
- Grab them.
- Take them down.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.655
<i>Get out of here.</i>

21:23.783 --> 21:25.785
Let's go.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.309
Looks like we're a
few weapons short.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.475
Cage.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.216
Grab their weapons.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.717
Let's keep moving.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.346
<i>My kind of peace summit.</i>

22:30.099 --> 22:34.060
Master Hiroshi, you cannot
ignore three witnesses.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.404
Cage must pay for this.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.653
Bring me Cage... alive.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.866
The clan that captures
him, will be rewarded.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.415
Bring these men their weapons.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.230
<i>- What was that?
- I don't know.</i>

24:01.231 --> 24:03.449
I didn't see it.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.205
<i>There's something out there.</i>

24:15.663 --> 24:17.506
Get in the light.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.778
I'm going to learn
that from you one day.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.668
Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge. Surge.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.294
It's an illusion.

25:46.295 --> 25:50.641
<i>Surge, we're still 200
feet underground.</i>

26:21.455 --> 26:24.128
Any bright ideas
now, little brother?

26:26.376 --> 26:28.252
Power count.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.839
I spent all mine getting
us off the summit floor.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.467
- Mar?
- Full.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.177
- Surge?
<i>- Thirsty.</i>

26:36.178 --> 26:38.521
- Surge.
- Full.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.109
<i>Barely lime to make a blue spark.</i>

26:45.145 --> 26:48.815
Did anyone get a look
at the assassin?

26:48.816 --> 26:52.695
No. It all happened so fast.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.531
It's got to be Becker.

26:56.281 --> 27:00.159
Becker? How could it be
Becker? You look nothing alike.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.703
The look on Becker's
face right after.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.000
Like he knew it was
going to happen.

27:05.001 --> 27:07.375
<i>Well, who would want
Fumitaka dead anyways?</i>

27:07.376 --> 27:09.210
It's Becker.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.462
He doesn't want peace.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.173
He wants us gone.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.884
He kills Fumitaka
and then blames me.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.971
<i>Gives him the excuse to finally
take our entire village out</i>

27:19.972 --> 27:21.973
<i>while putting him in tight
with the new regime.</i>

27:21.974 --> 27:24.397
Two birds, one stone.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.453
If you turn yourself in,
they'll let the rest of us go.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.956
- I doubt that.
<i>- It's worth a shot, isn't it?</i>

27:46.957 --> 27:49.500
We're just waiting
to die down here.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.627
Your loyalty is appreciated.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.755
You got us into this mess coming
to this ridiculous summit.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.493
- Surge, you're acting like an idiot.
- Oh, I'm an idiot, huh?

27:57.519 --> 27:59.421
I'm an idiot? Look where
it's gotten us to, huh?

27:59.422 --> 28:00.996
<i>Surge.</i>

28:04.933 --> 28:09.028
How is he going to hold
this clan together?

28:10.981 --> 28:15.202
Well, at least I'll be
drunk when we die.

28:19.740 --> 28:23.034
- We'll stay alive by the Code.
- Your Code is dead and so are we.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.702
Our Code is a commitment.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.538
To the clan. The village.
Each other.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.792
This isn't about us.
About whether we live.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.591
It's about whether our wives live,

28:33.592 --> 28:37.465
our children live, our clan lives.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.550
The Code is bigger than me.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.849
Bigger than us.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.640
Brother,

28:45.641 --> 28:50.237
we... must be bigger than us.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.494
Come on.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.747
Let's get out of here.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.321
Let's split up.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.406
I don't think that's a good idea.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.116
We'll never find each other.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.870
We've got to cover more ground.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.123
All right, let's split up.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.417
But remember this spot.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.841
Get back here in 15.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.934
Ahh.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.761
Two on one? I guess
the odds are even.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.032
Find anything?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.783
Six guarding a staircase.

37:25.784 --> 37:28.127
Must lead somewhere they
don't want us to go.

37:28.128 --> 37:31.465
Picked up some presents
for you. Where's Mar?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.467
Mar.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.096
No!

38:47.075 --> 38:51.250
Mar, guardian of clan and family.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.666
Your heart

38:55.667 --> 38:58.168
beat with bravery.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.671
Your blood

39:00.672 --> 39:03.382
flowed with sacrifice.

39:03.383 --> 39:07.183
Your death defined honor.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.648
Peace, my friend.

39:15.186 --> 39:20.399
Peace and honor in
the worlds to come.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.390
Grab whatever you can.
We're leaving in ten.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.448
Hey, Trillion.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.280
Trillion.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.245
You're going to make it.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.419
We're all going to make it.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.931
Your brother.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.268
Can you trust him with Sky?

40:38.394 --> 40:40.612
They're awfully close.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.617
Been close ever since
Sky came to us.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.028
Oh, Sky wasn't born to us.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.822
He was from Becker's clan.

40:50.823 --> 40:54.076
When they discovered he
couldn't hear or speak,

40:54.077 --> 40:57.120
they cast him out.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.540
Sky wandered all the way over
to the far territory to us,

41:00.541 --> 41:03.920
back when my father was
still master of our clan.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.381
Dad took him in,

41:07.382 --> 41:10.634
placed him with a family
that could raise him,

41:10.635 --> 41:14.685
and he's been loyal to me
and my brother ever since.

41:16.432 --> 41:19.685
He won't fight against us.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.157
<i>They've killed two of my men,</i>

41:34.158 --> 41:38.036
one of the Dragons, and at
least five of your guards.

41:38.037 --> 41:41.748
- Where are they now?
- They were last seen near the elevator.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.751
Which elevator?

41:45.628 --> 41:48.506
<i>The</i> elevator.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.095
Move.

41:55.096 --> 41:57.644
- Surge.
- That-a-way.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.859
Get back.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.406
Cage.

42:14.407 --> 42:17.410
Give it up and I'll
let your men go free.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.341
That is not an option.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.730
We're not getting through this way.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.900
We're going to have to go back.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.069
They're not advancing.
They're trying to block us.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.237
There must be an exit
behind that door.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.160
From behind.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.668
Do your men know that
you killed Fumitaka?

43:00.828 --> 43:03.251
Three witnesses saw you do it.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.044
Why would I kill him, huh?

43:09.045 --> 43:10.587
You're bitter, Cage.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.511
He chose Hiroshi over you.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.855
<i>Your men doubt you, Becker.</i>
They know you're behind this.

43:19.856 --> 43:21.858
<i>I wouldn't close my eyes tonight.</i>

43:23.059 --> 43:26.237
<i>If your men are smart, they'll
take care of you themselves.</i>

43:27.271 --> 43:29.189
Cage.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.775
<i>Where are your men now?</i>

43:31.776 --> 43:35.155
You want to see the Lost Clan?
I'll show you the Lost Clan.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.698
Fall in.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.357
Get them.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.773
Hey, here it is.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.617
- Let's go.
- Come on.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.412
Cage.

44:28.749 --> 44:31.172
Check the bags for weapons.

44:32.587 --> 44:35.181
I got some throwing knives.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.556
And black powder.

44:44.557 --> 44:48.518
For making fireballs.
Highly explosive.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.353
<i>No throwing stars.</i>

44:50.354 --> 44:52.697
<i>They're fire-throwers.
Do your homework.</i>

44:53.608 --> 44:55.360
I don't think I like your tone.

45:10.124 --> 45:12.217
What's that?

45:14.837 --> 45:16.463
Whoa.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.481
No. No, no, no, no.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.483
Ahh.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.278
God, this isn't good.

46:21.279 --> 46:24.614
- How do you call the elevator?
- You don't.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.451
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
<i>- It's a decoy. It only goes down.</i>

46:28.452 --> 46:31.705
<i>Whoever built this place, put them
in, so anyone trying to escape</i>

46:31.706 --> 46:33.873
would end up way
the hell down here.

46:33.874 --> 46:37.002
There must be another
way out of here.

46:38.087 --> 46:39.504
Another way out?

46:39.505 --> 46:42.303
- It's all your fault.
- Back off.

46:47.054 --> 46:50.849
I should've turned you in
when I had the chance.

46:50.850 --> 46:53.018
I should've left you at home.

46:54.603 --> 46:56.480
<i>Let him go, Surge.</i>

46:59.984 --> 47:01.735
No.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.279
I am the older son.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.408
Father should've never
put you in charge.

47:10.745 --> 47:14.080
You should be taking
orders from me.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.004
You'd be dead without me.

47:23.591 --> 47:25.593
No, you're wasting it.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.513
None of us are going to
have power until tomorrow.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.690
You're killing each other.

47:37.229 --> 47:39.197
You're killing us.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.819
Power count.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.571
- Power count.
- Nothing.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.532
I'm spent.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.909
How about you, Surge? You
saved some for us, right?

48:32.910 --> 48:36.960
- You thought of the clan, right?
- Yeah, I got something left.

48:38.457 --> 48:41.626
- You wasted it.
- We will stick together.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.425
There's no other way
out but together.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.433
<i>Let's go.</i>

49:58.996 --> 50:00.788
<i>Cage,</i>

50:00.789 --> 50:02.790
<i>I hope you're hearing this.</i>

50:02.791 --> 50:07.212
<i>I have evidence proving
your innocence.</i>

50:07.213 --> 50:09.839
<i>But I have to prove it
to the other clans.</i>

50:09.840 --> 50:11.633
<i>They want blood,</i>

50:11.634 --> 50:13.301
<i>and I can't hold them
off for too long.</i>

50:13.302 --> 50:15.178
<i>You've got to make it back here.</i>

50:15.179 --> 50:18.728
<i>There are two exit
elevators locate...</i>

50:24.313 --> 50:28.066
<i>Cage, I hope you're hearing this.</i>

50:28.067 --> 50:29.484
<i>I have evidence...</i>

50:29.485 --> 50:31.319
No, no, no, no. What elevators?

50:31.320 --> 50:33.446
<i>But I have to prove it
to the other clans.</i>

50:33.447 --> 50:35.240
<i>They want blood,</i>

50:35.241 --> 50:37.033
<i>and I can't hold them
off for too long.</i>

50:37.034 --> 50:38.535
<i>You've got to make it back here.</i>

50:38.536 --> 50:41.246
That's just great. You broke it.

50:41.247 --> 50:43.289
Hey. Hey, hey.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.792
Let's just keep moving.

50:45.793 --> 50:49.671
<i>Cage, I hope you're hearing this.</i>

50:49.672 --> 50:52.298
<i>I have evidence proving
your innocence.</i>

50:52.299 --> 50:54.927
<i>But I have to prove it
to the other clans.</i>

50:54.928 --> 50:56.719
<i>They want blood,</i>

50:56.720 --> 50:58.429
<i>and I can't hold them
off for too long.</i>

50:58.430 --> 51:00.090
<i>You've got to make it back...</i>

51:03.936 --> 51:06.109
Holy hell.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.571
What's that smell?

51:54.486 --> 51:57.364
It's been so many years.

51:59.283 --> 52:02.457
The air must have
preserved the flesh.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.083
It's almost like...

52:09.084 --> 52:12.053
Get it off me. Get it off me.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.100
You got to get me out of here, man.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.728
- Get me out of here.
- Hey.

52:28.729 --> 52:32.231
We stay together.
We'll find a way out.

52:32.232 --> 52:35.110
Okay?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.863
It's okay.

52:42.451 --> 52:44.452
<i>You okay?</i>

52:44.453 --> 52:46.830
Just relax.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.213
What the hell?

52:55.923 --> 52:58.016
Let's get out of here.

53:17.236 --> 53:18.862
Secure the door.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.492
No, no, no, no, no.

53:24.493 --> 53:26.411
Shh. Shut up.

53:26.412 --> 53:28.255
Why are we stopping?

54:28.474 --> 54:32.399
Okay, okay. It's okay.

54:38.984 --> 54:42.863
All right, let's have a look.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.330
Anybody got some water?

54:58.337 --> 55:00.305
We need to wrap that.

55:01.006 --> 55:02.928
Give me your belt.

55:15.896 --> 55:17.773
Here we go.

55:22.361 --> 55:24.362
You're going to make it.

55:24.363 --> 55:28.083
We're all going to make it.

55:31.995 --> 55:33.542
I don't know about you guys,

55:33.543 --> 55:36.667
but zombie killing makes me hungry.

56:20.168 --> 56:23.888
Come on. Let's get
the hell back home.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.614
Here it is.

56:49.531 --> 56:51.123
Start it up.

56:51.867 --> 56:53.576
- Come on.
- Start.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.670
It's not working.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.331
Trillion.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.505
Ahh.

57:02.628 --> 57:05.301
Come on. Get on it.

57:25.359 --> 57:28.069
I don't know this system,
you guys. I can't do this.

57:28.070 --> 57:30.948
Trillion. Come on.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.496
I got it. Come on, let's go.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.331
Here we go. Let's go.

58:22.332 --> 58:24.834
<i>- Get back in here.</i>
- Let's go.

58:38.682 --> 58:42.277
<i>There's too many.
The gate won't close.</i>

58:46.732 --> 58:48.984
Sky.

58:52.654 --> 58:55.031
<i>Come on. Sky.</i>

58:55.699 --> 58:58.201
Sky. Sky.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.245
No. No.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.664
<i>- Cage, it's too late.</i>
- No. Sky.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.542
<i>We can't save him.</i>

59:07.169 --> 59:08.886
<i>It's over.</i>

59:10.630 --> 59:11.672
No.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.891
Sky.

59:17.637 --> 59:19.263
<i>No, no.</i>

59:19.264 --> 59:21.732
<i>No, Sky, Sky, no.</i>

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:49.209
<i>I'm unarmed.</i>

01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:01.722
You can check for
yourself if you'd like.

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:24.123
You want to know who killed
Fumitaka, don't you?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.751
Tell me.

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:30.996
You look like you
could use some rest

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.333
<i>and attention.</i>

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.677
You have no idea.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.871
No weapons.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.369
This was the Warlord's
private apartment.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.288
Fully stocked by Fumitaka.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.624
It has everything you
could ever want.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.919
<i>Food. Wine.</i>

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.380
<i>Medical supplies.</i>

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.466
<i>Private exits.</i>

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.265
Private bedrooms.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:54.455
It was Becker, wasn't it?

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.924
Is that what you want me to say?

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:22.195
Do you not remember?

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.036
Remember what?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.789
The answers

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.705
are all

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.551
right... in there.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.075
It can't be.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.868
You're just tired.

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.286
You need to drink.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.747
What have you done?

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.421
Just relax.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.651
Find the exit.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:43.420
Come on.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:03.853
Ahh.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.710
<i>Leaving without saying goodbye?</i>

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.046
Now, that's just rude.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.589
Ahh.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.050
No need to rush home.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.304
Everyone in your village will
be dead before you get there.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.723
All the clans have been sent.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:44.397
Bye-bye, Lost Clan.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.345
Ahh!

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.613
We made it.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.666
Surge.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.835
You're going to make it.

01:08:52.836 --> 01:08:54.712
You're going to be all right.

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.758
Hold on. Please, please,
please, please, brother.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:00.102
Stay with me.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.763
Just hold on. Please.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.187
Surge. Stay with me.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:12.981
Hey. Stay with me.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.108
Stay with me.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.486
Please. Please, brother.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:21.161
Stay with me. I need your help.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.537
I... need you, brother.

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:21.133
I can't do this alone.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:26.138
Father chose

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.558
the right son.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.138
This will slow down the poison.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:07.138
Now rest.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.933
Rest.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:13.935
Impressive.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:17.303
You put up quite a fight.
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.401
The assassination,
I know you didn't do it.

01:11:22.402 --> 01:11:24.780
What a revelation.

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.905
Are you finally
admitting your guilt?

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.817
Three witnesses saw you.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.821
They saw an illusion.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.594
Do it, you coward.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.177
Kill me.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.971
Who is headed to my village?

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.806
What village?

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.641
Who killed Fumitaka?

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:36.485
You did.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.823
Didn't you?

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.597
Brother.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.636
Hey.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.846
Where are we?

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:57.600
Home, Surge. Home.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.484
The poison is moving again.

01:14:00.485 --> 01:14:02.771
We need to get you back
to the village now.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.856
Water.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.281
Okay, I'll be back in a second.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.107
Brother?

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.656
- Ahh.
- No!

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.587
Reveal yourself.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:05.338
Every clan has their secret weapon.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:09.880
But I have the most
powerful one of them all.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.934
Deceit.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.632
<i>You killed our master.</i>

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:58.262
- Why?
- When did you become so naive?

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:05.226
You have no honor. No
respect for the Code.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:08.196
I live by my own code.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:20.497
- You had everything.
- No, I had nothing.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.955
Master Fumitaka always
loved you most.

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:30.001
I knew you would
always be my enemy.

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:31.920
Fumitaka chose you.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:35.391
Only because I made it so.

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:04.869
<i>When we were young,</i>

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:07.539
my deceit was subtle.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:11.751
Master Fumitaka seeing
you steal an apple

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:16.005
or hearing you tell
a little white lie.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:20.176
Before long, he couldn't
quite trust you.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.387
That made him very sad.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:26.683
<i>It broke his poor little heart.</i>

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:30.728
Needless to say, I started
looking very promising to him.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.231
- He gave you everything.
- No.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:36.734
I waited years to
take over the clan.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.821
But our beloved Fumitaka

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:42.031
decided to call for peace,

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:46.662
<i>bring you and all the
others back into the fold.</i>

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:49.273
Ahh!

01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:55.355
I intercepted his message.

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:58.325
He was going to make
you his second.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.529
<i>Seeing you as master
of the Lost Clan,</i>

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:07.283
<i>upholding the Code so well.</i>

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:10.453
Practically made me vomit.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:13.539
That is why now you must die.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.898
Brother.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:46.327
Cage of the Lost Clan,

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.785
you are a great warrior

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.622
and an honorable ninja.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:01.508
As leader of the Southern Clan,

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:06.142
I promise you your homeland
will be protected.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.474
Don't protect us.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.398
Respect us.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.942
Come on, brother. Let's go home.
