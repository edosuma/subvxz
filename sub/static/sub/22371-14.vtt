00:01.502 --> 00:03.743
(machine-gun fire)

00:03.836 --> 00:06.204
(people screaming)

00:12.012 --> 00:14.424
(machine-gun fire continues)

00:21.230 --> 00:23.642
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

00:25.859 --> 00:28.817
(machine-gun fire)
(gasps)

00:28.904 --> 00:31.316
(people screaming)

00:39.748 --> 00:42.911
(woman screams)

00:43.001 --> 00:45.413
(machine-gun fire in distance)

00:52.052 --> 00:54.419
(Spits)

00:56.598 --> 00:58.965
Shouldn't have played,
lady.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.016
Not your game.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.515
(machine-gun fire)

01:21.290 --> 01:23.782
(walker growling)

01:38.974 --> 01:41.966
(growling continues)

02:00.871 --> 02:02.532
(metal bar thuds)

02:03.999 --> 02:05.581
(metal bar clangs)

02:20.015 --> 02:23.929
(breathing shakily)

02:28.231 --> 02:30.142
(sniffles)

02:33.737 --> 02:36.229
(door opens)

02:38.659 --> 02:41.071
(door closes)

02:55.384 --> 02:59.093
(crying)

03:11.274 --> 03:13.686
(sniffles)

03:22.869 --> 03:25.577
(sniffles)

03:39.678 --> 03:42.136
(sighs)

04:06.621 --> 04:08.658
Negan:
What the shit?

04:12.753 --> 04:16.620
No, really, just tell me--
what the shit?!

04:16.714 --> 04:18.375
(theme music playing)

04:57.756 --> 05:00.748
(walkers growling)

05:09.851 --> 05:12.889
The escapees could be en route
to the Sanctuary.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.095
They are Henry's quarry
and Henry, ours.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.852
There could be another attack.
Maggie needs me here.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.731
You can leave.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.732
But you choose not to.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.860
Tell me why.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.816
Just go.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.657
You think
he's already dead.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.450
Is that what you believe?

05:36.545 --> 05:42.382
Or can you not allow yourself
to believe otherwise?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.708
You told me to pretend
to make it real

05:44.803 --> 05:46.635
until it is so,
and you cannot.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.555
It may not be so.

05:50.642 --> 05:55.261
There are those who believe
that the day defeats the night.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.144
Though,
there are others, afraid,

05:59.234 --> 06:02.352
who choose to believe
the opposite.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.982
They can.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.280
They choose.

06:07.367 --> 06:12.487
They decide,
as you decided before.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.448
I fear for Henry.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.786
You, who I thought were
the bravest person I've met...

06:22.424 --> 06:25.132
No.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.549
You...

06:30.348 --> 06:32.680
You're stopped by cowardice.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.776
Hi.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.448
Hey.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.487
It's been over a day.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.825
Still not sick.
Doc says I'm cool.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.000
You're a tough
son of a bitch.

07:04.090 --> 07:10.006
Daryl, it just means that Dwight
shot me with a clean arrow.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.885
Or it means you got lucky.
Could be anything.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.307
It's not like a bite.
Sometimes nothing happens.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.728
- Daryl...
- Look, if Dwight knew,

07:19.814 --> 07:21.396
could've warned us,
could've sent us a message.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.145
Well, maybe he couldn't.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.023
He let a whole day go by while
our people lay around dying.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.856
Everybody else in the battle
who got injured got sick.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.192
That can't be an accident.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.536
So he just gets a pass?
Is that it?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.081
Maybe.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.532
Look, you said
that we might need him,

07:40.627 --> 07:41.913
and we might need him now
more than ever,

07:42.003 --> 07:44.870
and what I'm saying is that
if I had killed him,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.332
maybe I would be dead
right now.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.011
Look, do what you gotta do.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.848
But know it's just for you.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.268
I'm out.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.524
(sniffles)

08:17.664 --> 08:20.156
(sighs)

08:21.876 --> 08:24.368
(sniffles)

08:25.964 --> 08:29.298
(sighs)

08:38.559 --> 08:40.096
Do you...

08:42.230 --> 08:44.471
Do you want to read it?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.614
You're going out there.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.121
We need food.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.168
I'm gonna find some.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.996
What did he write you?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.005
I don't know.
I-l can't.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.260
- Wait.
- I can't.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.216
You have to.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.684
I did it, too...

09:26.775 --> 09:29.938
when it happened to me.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.316
You keep moving
to move away from it.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.486
Andrea stopped me.

09:37.577 --> 09:42.697
(voice breaking) And now...
I'm stopping you.

09:46.961 --> 09:51.421
Carl wrote that because
he wanted you to read it.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.044
It was one of the last things
he ever did.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.135
You're stayin'.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.780
(breathes deeply)

10:28.419 --> 10:30.877
(sighs)

10:51.776 --> 10:54.359
Carol: You goin' lookin'
for him?

10:54.445 --> 10:57.358
<i>For them.</i>

10:57.448 --> 11:00.440
- You don't have to, Morgan.
- I do.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.027
I could've before,
and I should've.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.282
I was supposed to.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.704
See, we're the same,
and I was supposed to.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.702
And I thought that...

11:12.380 --> 11:14.542
Thought I had to.
(chuckles)

11:14.632 --> 11:18.045
Thought it'd be different.
(sighs)

11:20.889 --> 11:23.130
Morgan.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.052
Fine.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.353
But I'm coming with you.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.421
The relay cars are in position.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.838
If the Saviors
are coming back,

11:57.926 --> 11:59.587
we'll have 10,
maybe 15 minutes heads-up.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.384
- And our ammo?
- 'Bout what we thought.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.428
Not enough to fend off
another attack of that size.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.632
Daryl: Well, maybe we don't gotta
worry about that no more.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.387
At least for now.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.765
Maybe going hand-to-hand's
our only option.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.562
You think
they're low on ammo?

12:12.649 --> 12:13.889
Well, they must've gone through
a whole bunch of it

12:13.983 --> 12:15.439
getting through them walkers
at Sanctuary.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.268
And there's not a lot of places
to find more.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.194
Mierda.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.493
They have our bullet maker.
They can make more.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.161
You think the Saviors have
what he'd need to make them?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.831
If they don't,
I know where they'd find it.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.501
Negan: I smell it.

12:42.595 --> 12:47.840
Whatever the holy hell
happened here, I smell it.

12:49.936 --> 12:56.399
That's what that fire is about,
that salt, burning it away.

12:56.484 --> 13:00.819
I told you,
people are a resource.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.648
I don't throw resources
like that away.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.278
I got a lot of confidence

13:06.369 --> 13:09.031
that most people can be put
on the right path--

13:09.122 --> 13:12.240
"W path.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.075
I wouldn't have killed
all your people.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.910
No.

13:17.005 --> 13:22.546
That was the work of someone
not following the program.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.927
But this?

13:27.849 --> 13:31.262
This is my mistake.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.559
I'll own this.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.137
I took a chance
on someone,

13:36.232 --> 13:37.814
thought I was doing
the right thing,

13:37.900 --> 13:41.438
and all I did
was punch myself in the dick.

13:42.864 --> 13:47.028
I am sorry for this.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.485
I really am.

13:49.579 --> 13:53.573
I'm sorry that you lost
all you had.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.534
But I know, in some way,
I can help get it back,

13:57.628 --> 13:58.618
that we--

13:58.713 --> 13:59.703
(grunts)

14:05.928 --> 14:08.841
This is our best bet.
It'd make sense

14:08.931 --> 14:11.969
they'd stay near the road
they'd take to get there.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.394
50/50 chance they'd be...

14:20.068 --> 14:22.230
What is it?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.231
Turnip.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.607
They were on
this side of the road.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.661
Henry.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.084
Henry!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.628
Henry!

14:52.266 --> 14:54.598
Henry.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.267
You know what it is.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.820
You were supposed to.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.862
You're not here.
He's not here.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.321
You are not here!

15:19.252 --> 15:20.413
You weren't
supposed to be there.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.085
You weren't.
You were...

15:29.303 --> 15:32.466
He's dead.
You know he is.

15:32.557 --> 15:36.391
I didn't come out here
to look for him.

15:36.477 --> 15:40.345
I came out here
to keep an eye on you.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.976
Yeah, I've seen it.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.564
You save people.
I've seen it again and again.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.821
But you can't save
the dead, Carol.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.653
You're not dead.

15:56.747 --> 16:01.287
I know. Not me.
I don't die.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.586
I just see it.

16:04.672 --> 16:10.588
Again and again.

16:10.678 --> 16:15.423
And even when I look away,
still see it.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.445
Came through here.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.951
Probably a shortcut.

16:41.042 --> 16:44.125
Straight line
to the road ahead.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.790
(indistinct conversations)

17:30.508 --> 17:32.670
Rick: Where'd they go?

17:32.760 --> 17:36.094
- We already told Maggie every--
- So, tell me.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.344
Sanctuary's our best guess.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.052
It's pretty much our only guess.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.012
There'd been some talk
about trying to get out,

17:46.107 --> 17:48.769
but it was just talk,
nothin' specific.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.850
Thinkin' they had a plan's
giving 'em too much credit.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.401
They saw an opening,
and they took it.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.447
What if it was you?
How'd you get back there?

17:56.534 --> 17:59.947
You're on foot,
there's probably someone injured.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.951
Maybe you need a place
to hole up and figure things out.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.542
There's an old dive bar three
miles off Edgehill Parkway.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.543
Some of them, uh,
took me there once.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.375
They wanted my expert opinion
on what it'd take

18:15.469 --> 18:18.302
to turn the place
into an outpost.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.845
It's between here and there,

18:19.932 --> 18:21.548
but the chances
they'd actually g--

18:21.642 --> 18:23.178
H9)!-

18:24.604 --> 18:27.221
I don't know if this is any kind
of a lead,

18:27.315 --> 18:30.808
but if you're
going out there...

18:30.901 --> 18:33.438
it's not for nothing--
can you do me a favor?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.856
If you happen to find them...

18:38.993 --> 18:41.530
...don't kill any more of them
than you have to.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.910
When it went bad last night,
they-- they made a choice.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.492
It was the wrong choice.

18:48.586 --> 18:54.172
Some of them,
probably hasn't hit 'em yet.

18:54.258 --> 18:58.297
You could show 'em...
by bringin' 'em back.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.424
You could do that.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.844
Yeah, I could.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.521
(watch alarm beeping)

19:14.612 --> 19:17.024
(beeping stops)

19:18.866 --> 19:21.654
Negan:Hey.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.530
Hey!

19:23.621 --> 19:26.113
Hey!
Let's talk about this!

19:27.541 --> 19:29.578
I had nothing to do
with this!

19:32.963 --> 19:35.500
(grunting)

19:38.803 --> 19:41.261
(groans)

19:43.891 --> 19:46.223
(walker growling)

19:46.310 --> 19:48.847
(wheels squeaking)

19:50.898 --> 19:53.560
- (gunshot)
- I got your flare

19:53.651 --> 19:56.643
for that little fire you were
gonna start with my girl.

19:56.737 --> 20:00.401
And let me tell you,
I pulled my punch.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.904
Tried to hit old
Mr. Ninety-Degrees there.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.487
Look, whatever you're doing...

20:07.581 --> 20:10.164
you must not really
want to do it.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.992
'Cause if you did,
you wouldn't have left me

20:12.086 --> 20:15.795
sitting here
with a bag full of guns.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.964
Found something else
in there, too.

20:20.970 --> 20:25.055
Gotta think these snaps
are near and dear.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.468
So let's have a chat.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.645
Let the healing begin.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.864
We should wait.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.067
Let it pass.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.369
Trail goes straight through.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.447
We could lose it.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.704
We could lose
more than the trail.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.161
(walkers growling)

20:56.255 --> 20:58.462
Morgan.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.007
(walker growling)

21:05.681 --> 21:07.467
That stick.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.508
It's Henry's.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.061
(growling continues)

21:17.943 --> 21:20.401
(growling continues)

21:47.515 --> 21:49.506
Morgan, stop.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.932
It came from the other road.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.354
We go that way, maybe--
maybe we can find him.

21:57.441 --> 22:01.275
We take that road,
you know what we'll find.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.944
But I don't.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.069
I decided--
I decided what it would be.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.828
But I won't know
unless I go...

22:12.915 --> 22:15.498
unless I try.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.120
And you can try, too.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.701
No.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.037
No, I can't.
I...

22:23.634 --> 22:27.548
You save people.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.549
I watch 'em die.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.218
I have to.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.304
I'm supposed to.

22:38.399 --> 22:42.393
When I tried to run,
you found me.

22:42.486 --> 22:46.480
You saved me.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.614
You knew
I could come back.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.325
And you can, too.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.620
That wasn't me.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.753
I'm not strong like you.

23:08.012 --> 23:11.346
I was there that whole time,
watchin' 'em,

23:11.432 --> 23:13.764
knowin' that something
would happen.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.592
I knew it. I saw it.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.769
I was waiting for it to happen,
and then it did, like it...

23:21.358 --> 23:23.599
Like it always does.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.197
So I just have to.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.446
I have to kill 'em.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.527
I have to.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.202
Morgan...

23:50.971 --> 23:52.553
Morgan.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.735
(walker growling)

24:11.408 --> 24:13.570
Leave those pictures alone.

24:13.661 --> 24:17.450
I figured they meant
something to you.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.622
Especially considering
this is it, right?

24:20.709 --> 24:24.418
I mean, it's not like you can
just pop around the corner

24:24.505 --> 24:26.496
and order yourself
some prints.

24:26.590 --> 24:30.299
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.002
What the shit?

24:32.096 --> 24:35.680
I mean, this--
this is how you kill people?

24:35.766 --> 24:37.006
With that thing?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.433
Slowly?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.431
No.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.059
People are a resource.

24:46.026 --> 24:49.144
Move the flare away--
please.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.024
They're all I have left.

24:51.115 --> 24:54.949
They're all this place has left.
You took my world, everything.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.742
You took away me.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.366
(growling continues)

25:02.960 --> 25:07.375
My wife's name
was Lucille.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.831
She got me through.

25:09.925 --> 25:14.010
I didn't give her shit,
and she got me through.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.337
Just life.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.470
Regular life.

25:19.560 --> 25:25.476
The bat--
The bat got me through this.

25:25.566 --> 25:29.150
So I named it after her.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.979
That's it. Nothing more
to do with her than that.

25:33.073 --> 25:37.158
But it is the last little piece
of her that I got left.

25:37.244 --> 25:42.080
Sort of like these snaps
for you, huh?

25:42.166 --> 25:44.328
Yes.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.830
(watch alarm beeping)

25:46.920 --> 25:50.083
(helicopter blades whirring)

25:50.174 --> 25:52.415
(walker growls)

25:52.509 --> 25:55.126
Just stop.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.674
(grunting)

26:07.024 --> 26:09.436
(walker growling)

26:21.580 --> 26:24.288
What the shit?

26:27.711 --> 26:30.203
(growling continues)

26:32.549 --> 26:34.790
No!No!No!

26:34.885 --> 26:37.627
I'm here! I'm here!

26:37.721 --> 26:40.634
I'm here!

26:40.724 --> 26:42.965
I'm here.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.472
(growling continues)

26:55.489 --> 26:57.150
<i>Negan:
No. No, don't:!</i>

26:57.241 --> 27:00.609
Don't!

27:00.702 --> 27:04.240
L-I didn't burn your pictures.

27:04.331 --> 27:06.698
I didn't do it.
I wouldn't.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.578
That is all
I have left of her.

27:08.669 --> 27:13.163
You burn her,
and all you have is ashes.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.170
No, I get to hurt you.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.385
I didn't do it.

27:20.472 --> 27:25.308
I can settle it.

27:25.394 --> 27:30.514
I swear on my sack,
I will.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.348
I can settle it.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.308
Okay?

27:37.364 --> 27:39.355
Okay?

27:44.705 --> 27:47.117
(crying)

27:59.636 --> 28:02.094
(walkers growling in distance)

28:10.981 --> 28:12.437
Morgan.

28:12.524 --> 28:16.062
Morgan. Morgan, hey.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.269
You know me.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.113
Inn:

28:27.497 --> 28:29.613
I'm not right.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.751
Maybe-- Maybe you
shouldn't be out--

28:37.841 --> 28:40.253
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.923
You're out here for them.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.849
Me, too.

28:56.109 --> 29:00.103
Then, we finish it,
you and me.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.466
Uhuds)

29:33.730 --> 29:36.188
(man coughing)

29:42.322 --> 29:46.907
Evan: We had to get off the road,
out of the forest, and still...

29:46.994 --> 29:48.234
Maybe we didn't do it
in time.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.818
Yeah, but maybe we did.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.780
- (man coughs)
- Maybe they don't look so hot

29:52.874 --> 29:54.911
'cause we hacked off
part of them.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.369
We're not just gonna
leave them here.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.079
(man groans, coughs)

30:00.173 --> 30:02.585
Look at them.
They're dead already.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.633
He's right.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.427
They knew the rules.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.675
You pooch it,
nobody carries you.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.847
After everything
we've been through?

30:10.934 --> 30:12.516
- Things are shaky, man. Let's not--
- Look, we got the rules

30:12.602 --> 30:14.718
so somebody goin' down don't
take the rest of us with them.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.599
Case in point.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.727
We could've been
halfway home by now.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.650
How long was I out?

30:21.737 --> 30:23.774
Just long enough
to end up here.

30:23.864 --> 30:27.107
Say we make it.
Huh? What then?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.611
Man: He's right, Jared.

30:28.702 --> 30:31.194
What do we got waiting for us
back there?

30:31.288 --> 30:34.201
Maybe we go our own way,
be done with the Saviors.

30:34.291 --> 30:38.000
Man: We pooched it.
Simon wasn't gonna carry us.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.124
That's right.
Because we lost.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.454
But things have changed.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.627
Delivering Rick the Prick
to Negan is a win.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.678
We wiped our own asses
on this one,

30:49.765 --> 30:51.722
and the Big Man
is gonna recognize.

30:51.808 --> 30:55.051
Hey. He's awake.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.603
(man coughs)

31:00.984 --> 31:02.975
Rise and shine, curly.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.482
You ready to do
some walkin'?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.984
Yeah.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.816
Of course you are.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.321
Pack it up, boys!

31:11.411 --> 31:14.153
We're ditchin' the dead weight
and movin' on.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.079
This is a loose-end
sort of thing, that's it.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.998
It's gonna be better for you,
better for us.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.326
Rick: Wait!
My truck's not far.

31:20.420 --> 31:24.288
We can get 'em
to the Hilltop's doctor.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.919
They could come back
with us.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.379
You all could.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.931
You didn't want this.

31:34.017 --> 31:36.349
You made a split-second choice,
and you chose wrong,

31:36.436 --> 31:37.676
but it's not too late.

31:37.771 --> 31:41.730
You cut us loose,
you cooperate...

31:41.817 --> 31:44.024
we'll give you a fresh start.

31:44.111 --> 31:47.570
A chance to become
part of our community,

31:47.656 --> 31:49.693
to become one of us.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.696
I'm giving you my word.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.867
There's not a lot
that's worth much these days,

31:56.957 --> 31:59.745
but a man's word...

31:59.835 --> 32:03.248
that's gotta mean somethin',
right?

32:09.636 --> 32:13.379
You asshats aren't dumb enough
to believe that.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.056
We can hear him out.
W-We could talk it over.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.386
Thing is,
there isn't time for that.

32:20.564 --> 32:24.148
There's a herd out there, close,
probably headed this way.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.566
You're all gonna need
to make a choice,

32:26.653 --> 32:28.143
and it's gonna
have to be now.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.229
Wake up, everybody!

32:30.323 --> 32:31.905
There isn't any herd.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.905
There isn't any "deal"
waiting back at Hilltop.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.487
You think these asswipes
came here to save us?

32:37.581 --> 32:40.494
They came here for blood.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.951
Hell, this one strangled
one of his own guys to death

32:43.044 --> 32:45.126
with his own hands.

32:48.091 --> 32:54.963
All Rick is saying here
is a steaming pile of bullshit.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.176
You know, you're right.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.511
I came here to do
what I was supposed to.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.356
To kill every last one of you.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.901
(scoffs)

33:19.748 --> 33:23.616
You should save your bullets,
'cause you're gonna need 'em.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.122
That herd, it is comin'.

33:26.213 --> 33:29.001
Maybe they'll hear the moans
or the coughs, you know?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.922
Maybe they'll just stumble in
through the open walls,

33:31.009 --> 33:33.467
<i>but they are comm'.</i>

33:33.553 --> 33:35.260
And then after--

33:35.347 --> 33:39.306
after,
when you're just torn skin

33:39.392 --> 33:42.305
and loose teeth and blood...

33:42.395 --> 33:44.978
when you're nothing
but the stuff that they didn't eat...

33:46.942 --> 33:49.058
...well, that'll be a damn shame.

33:50.570 --> 33:54.655
Because there won't be a single
one of you left for me to kill.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.943
Jared: We're done.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.825
Let's dump 'em and bounce.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.030
I want a sandwich.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.865
Morgan:
See? it doesn't change.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.246
It never changes.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.373
And I don't die.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.918
I don't. Nobody dies!

34:10.005 --> 34:11.838
'Cause everybody turns!

34:11.925 --> 34:15.168
Hey! Everybody turns!

34:15.262 --> 34:16.844
Hey.
What are you doing?

34:16.929 --> 34:19.422
You'll ruin our chances
of getting back to Hilltop.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.768
(walkers growling)

34:33.362 --> 34:36.275
Man:
Walkers! We're surrounded!

34:36.366 --> 34:39.154
Thing is,
we've already killed you.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.952
Some coming in!
Some coming in!

34:42.038 --> 34:44.496
(growling continues)

34:46.208 --> 34:48.621
(man shouts indistinctly)

34:57.387 --> 35:00.425
Come on, Derek!

35:02.976 --> 35:05.217
You're too weak to take on
this herd alone.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.427
Cut us loose.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.977
Give us our weapons.
We can help you!

35:08.064 --> 35:10.396
No! Nobody's cutting
anybodyloose!

35:10.483 --> 35:11.814
I'm killing these pricks
right now.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.142
- (grunts)
- Come on!

35:14.237 --> 35:17.696
Aah!

35:17.782 --> 35:19.523
Man: No!

35:19.618 --> 35:22.451
- Come on!
- We gotta find a way out!

35:22.537 --> 35:25.495
(ropes tear)

35:25.582 --> 35:28.074
(growling continues)

35:31.838 --> 35:34.079
Hey, give me the stick!

35:39.929 --> 35:41.590
(machine-gun fire)

35:48.605 --> 35:50.187
We're almost out.
Go on ahead.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.542
Son of a bitch!

36:14.464 --> 36:15.795
Aah!

36:15.882 --> 36:18.089
(screaming)
(walkers growling)

36:24.724 --> 36:27.136
(growling continues)

36:59.259 --> 37:01.170
(grunts)

37:09.394 --> 37:11.681
(grunting)

37:11.771 --> 37:14.513
You like sticks, right?

37:18.361 --> 37:20.147
(grunts)

37:26.161 --> 37:27.947
<i>Let go'. Let go'.!</i>

37:28.037 --> 37:31.155
Let 9Q! No no'
Let g9! I

37:31.249 --> 37:33.331
Let go!

37:33.418 --> 37:34.624
Aah!

37:36.129 --> 37:37.619
Aah!

37:37.714 --> 37:39.830
Aah! Let go!

37:39.924 --> 37:41.289
(crying) Let go!

37:41.384 --> 37:43.125
Let go!

37:43.219 --> 37:44.960
Let go.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.223
(screaming)

37:50.310 --> 37:52.802
(walkers growling,
flesh rending)

38:07.786 --> 38:11.529
(shuddered breathing)

38:16.753 --> 38:19.620
You said...

38:19.714 --> 38:21.955
- You said--
- I lied.

38:22.050 --> 38:25.463
L-- I didn't.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.840
We could've..

38:27.931 --> 38:32.016
We could've lived...
after.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.058
After this.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.381
Everybody turns.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.348
You saved me.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.901
Morgan, you saved me.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.031
I would've died.

39:29.117 --> 39:34.362
Maybe on that street,
right in front of your house.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.197
You didn't know me.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.083
Why'd you do it?

39:42.922 --> 39:44.083
We should go.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.255
Just tell me.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.420
Why'd you save me?

39:51.514 --> 39:52.925
- You had your son there.
- No.

39:53.016 --> 39:55.007
- You did.
- Hey, no.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.395
Why'd you save me? Why?

40:01.482 --> 40:03.940
Because.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.939
Be--

40:09.532 --> 40:11.773
Because my son was there.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.600
You didn't lose you.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.646
You should know that.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.902
You know, I wasn't
always like this

40:56.996 --> 40:59.488
before... all this.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.746
This just showed me
who I really was,

41:03.836 --> 41:07.079
what was inside of me
from day one.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.917
Normal life...

41:12.011 --> 41:15.424
Normal life doesn't show you
what you're made of.

41:22.271 --> 41:27.311
When God's caustic, acidic,
white-hot flaming diarrhea

41:27.402 --> 41:30.440
rains down
from heaven above,

41:30.530 --> 41:34.364
see, it burns away
everything you don't need.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.317
Because if you needed it,

41:37.412 --> 41:40.325
hell, you'd be dead,
wouldn't you?

41:40.415 --> 41:43.373
And what's left?

41:43.459 --> 41:46.451
Well, that is the strongest,
balls-to-the-wall

41:46.546 --> 41:48.287
middle finger
to the goddamn

41:48.381 --> 41:51.749
world version of you
that ever could be.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.465
The one you always were,

41:55.555 --> 41:57.421
that you were afraid
to let out

41:57.515 --> 42:01.884
because it's so damn powerful
that, yeah...

42:01.978 --> 42:04.970
it scares
the caustic, acidic,

42:05.064 --> 42:08.807
white-hot flaming
brown diarrhea out of you.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.483
And that...

42:10.570 --> 42:11.731
(lips squeak)

42:11.821 --> 42:14.813
Well, that burns away
someone else's

42:14.907 --> 42:20.073
plastic, phony, wishy-washy,
look-to-the-horizon crap,

42:20.163 --> 42:21.619
and you can
get yourself an army

42:21.706 --> 42:25.574
of like-minded ass-handlers
like you just did.

42:25.668 --> 42:30.754
That is still
inside you, Jadis.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.923
You couldn't get rid of that
if you tried.

42:37.764 --> 42:41.723
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell happened here?

42:41.809 --> 42:44.676
What that was all about?

42:51.110 --> 42:53.852
You can come with me,
you know.

42:53.946 --> 42:56.187
Follow a new path.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.649
<i>You r path'?</i>

43:01.454 --> 43:04.242
The offer stands.

43:04.332 --> 43:08.041
I'll swing by again sometime.

43:08.127 --> 43:10.585
Who knows?

43:10.671 --> 43:14.209
Maybe you'll want to share.

43:37.490 --> 43:40.027
- (walker growling)
- Henry: Help me!

43:40.118 --> 43:43.156
Help me!

43:43.246 --> 43:44.862
(walkers growling)

43:44.956 --> 43:46.492
Help me!

43:47.667 --> 43:49.203
Please!

43:49.293 --> 43:52.160
Help me! Help me!

43:56.801 --> 43:59.714
(grunting)

44:09.897 --> 44:13.140
(breathing heavily)

44:15.236 --> 44:18.319
(Crying) I'm sorry!

44:18.406 --> 44:20.613
I'm sorry.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.532
It's okay.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.488
I'm sorry.

44:27.582 --> 44:30.700
I'm so, so sorry.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.750
I was wrong.

44:35.423 --> 44:36.709
You can survive.

44:36.799 --> 44:44.013
I was wrong.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.803
On it.

44:51.898 --> 44:55.141
(clanging)
Hey! Come here! Right here!

44:55.234 --> 44:57.851
Yo!
Distract the deadies!

44:57.945 --> 45:00.528
That's it!
Come right here!

45:00.615 --> 45:03.232
Over here!
Over here! Hey!

45:03.326 --> 45:04.862
(clanging)

45:04.952 --> 45:06.442
Your Majesty!

45:09.957 --> 45:12.619
- (door opens)
- Dude.

45:18.466 --> 45:20.423
Ezekiel!

45:22.178 --> 45:23.919
(chuckles)

45:53.584 --> 45:55.575
(grunts)

46:03.469 --> 46:06.211
What I uttered before...

46:06.305 --> 46:07.841
calling you a coward...

46:10.518 --> 46:13.806
I pray you'll forgive me.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.182
I was wrong
not to have faith

46:15.273 --> 46:18.106
in your bravery.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.808
In your strength.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.400
You were right.
I was afraid.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.198
Oh, yeah, you were.
I saw it.

46:30.997 --> 46:32.829
But you are no coward.

46:38.296 --> 46:42.164
I said it, but...
I was afraid.

46:46.345 --> 46:48.677
For Henry.

46:53.185 --> 46:54.971
I had a daughter.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.481
After I lost her, I...

47:03.571 --> 47:06.404
I was nothing.

47:06.490 --> 47:10.825
But the people
I was with...

47:10.911 --> 47:14.950
being with them...

47:15.041 --> 47:18.534
I found myself.

47:18.627 --> 47:21.494
Some version of myself,
a better self.

47:25.468 --> 47:29.086
Still, it always feels
like it could just...

47:29.180 --> 47:31.262
just be swept away again.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.268
But that doesn't mean it will,
and...

47:39.690 --> 47:41.306
...and it doesn't mean

47:41.400 --> 47:44.108
that I couldn't find myself
again if it does.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.532
(door opens)

48:32.993 --> 48:35.405
I, um...

48:35.496 --> 48:37.203
I killed them.

48:37.289 --> 48:41.374
I killed the man
who killed your brother.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.326
I did.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.131
I killed him.

48:51.137 --> 48:54.050
I'm sorry.

48:57.685 --> 49:01.929
No.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.013
Don't ever be sorry.

49:22.960 --> 49:27.875
(door opens, closes)

49:33.053 --> 49:35.465
(sniffles)

49:40.352 --> 49:42.764
(crying)

49:51.655 --> 49:54.067
(door closes)

50:34.698 --> 50:37.190
(engine revving)

50:41.413 --> 50:43.905
Jesus Christ.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.704
(brakes squeal)

50:53.092 --> 50:55.254
Holy hell.

50:55.344 --> 51:00.510
If shit could shit, it still
wouldn't look as shitty as you.

51:00.599 --> 51:03.341
Get in.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.927
(walker growling,
chains rattling)

51:12.361 --> 51:14.819
(brakes squeal)

51:22.580 --> 51:26.039
Negan. I knew it.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.412
I knew you were alive.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.789
Hell yes, I am.

51:30.879 --> 51:33.416
But you're not gonna say a word.
You understand?

51:33.507 --> 51:36.499
Daddy's home,
and it's gonna be a surprise.

51:36.594 --> 51:41.509
Hell, I got all sorts
of surprises to roll out.

51:47.813 --> 51:49.724
Well, looks like you're right.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.556
It's up and runnin'.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.017
Rosita: Yep.

51:54.111 --> 51:58.446
Buckets of casings for Eugene
to turn into hundreds of bullets.

51:58.532 --> 52:00.489
Let's do it now.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.120
We don't take out
the machines.

52:07.207 --> 52:08.993
We take out the man.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.167
Rick: Thank you.

52:57.257 --> 53:00.716
(breathes deeply)

53:00.803 --> 53:03.044
I'm sorry.

53:03.138 --> 53:06.551
You don't have to be.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.850
I love you.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.521
I love you, too.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.597
(theme music playing)
