WEBVTT

00:04.503 --> 00:06.672
SPIDER-MAN: Couldn't you have
made this a three-seater, Ock?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.274
This submarine was only designed

00:08.276 --> 00:10.876
for two occupants,
you web-brained dolt.

00:10.878 --> 00:14.280
I did not expect to pick up a
hitchhiker this deep in the ocean.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.848
We're going too slow.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.716
We need to get to that sunken island.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.786
This is probably the least likely
team-up you could imagine, right?

00:20.788 --> 00:23.422
<i>First, there's Doc Ock, extremely evil,</i>

00:23.424 --> 00:25.424
<i>having formed an alliance
with Scarlet Spider</i>

00:25.426 --> 00:28.761
<i>in order to find the also
very evil Arnim Zola,</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:30.262
<i>he of Hydra and TV bellies.</i>

00:30.264 --> 00:32.464
<i>Ock wants back the research
Zola stole from him.</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:34.600
<i>Scarlet wants to know
the truth about his past.</i>

00:34.602 --> 00:37.603
<i>He has no memory of who he was before
Ock and Zola experimented on him.</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:39.538
<i>So, Ock promised Scarlet
everything he needs</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.140
<i>is on the sunken Hydra Island,</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:42.875
<i>where Zola also happens to be trapped,</i>

00:42.877 --> 00:44.543
<i>currently out of commission.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.145
<i>Meanwhile, my pal Mary Jane Watson,</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:48.280
<i>who, BTW, has been
secretly Spider-Woman...</i>

00:48.282 --> 00:50.149
<i>That's a whole other thing...
Is rounding up</i>

00:50.151 --> 00:51.717
<i>the rest of the Web Warriors to help.</i>

00:51.719 --> 00:53.953
As for me, I came along
'cause I kinda totally

00:53.955 --> 00:56.155
a thousand percent don't trust Ock.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.057
No matter what he's promised Scarlet.

00:58.059 --> 00:58.865
Ugh!

00:58.927 --> 01:00.863
We do not need a babysitter.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.461
I can take care of myself.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.597
With this guy, you need someone watching
your back eight different ways.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.499
Perhaps you'd do well to remember

01:07.501 --> 01:10.135
that I have kept
your true identity a secret,

01:10.137 --> 01:11.770
Peter Parker.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.406
Despite your prejudiced beliefs about me,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.241
I do have a code of honor.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.144
In this situation, we have a common enemy,

01:19.146 --> 01:20.946
Arnim Zola.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.614
MAN: (ON RADIO) <i>Attention,</i>
<i>unauthorized vehicle.</i>

01:22.616 --> 01:25.985
<i>Hydra Security Protocol 8 dot 65 engaged.</i>

01:25.987 --> 01:28.894
This is an automated system of my design.

01:30.323 --> 01:33.759
Deactivated. You need to
open the island's airlock.

01:33.761 --> 01:38.197
I shall remain here in case I must deal
with any other triggers you set off.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.268
Trusting Ock? (SCOFFS) We
should know better, right?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.204
I just want inside this island.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.543
Ock betrayed us.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.711
Of course he did.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.381
I just wish his betrayal
wasn't laser-guided.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.230
Am I the worst?

02:11.232 --> 02:13.198
I totally knew better than to trust Ock.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.067
But guess what?
We still did it.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.469
SCARLET SPIDER: We did what we had to do.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.904
(GRUNTS)

02:18.906 --> 02:21.673
Whoa! Angry much?
Ben, you okay?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.709
You're not exactly known
for your long fuse,

02:23.711 --> 02:25.077
but this is a bit much.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.923
I'm fine.

02:27.048 --> 02:28.362
Hold it together, buddy.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.773
Can't do this alone.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.528
On second thought, maybe we
could use some blind rage.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.456
Ock couldn't have put us
in a tighter spot.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.758
This unfortunate situation
was not my fault.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.327
I told you the defense
systems were automated.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.930
And it appears Hydra has locked me out.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.974
Yet, you two ingrates
were so quick to doubt me.

02:49.070 --> 02:50.536
(GRUNTS)

02:50.538 --> 02:52.971
Exactly why I never trust
the opinions of others.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.609
I do not need to explain once again

02:57.611 --> 03:00.712
why I am trustworthy, you pathetic fool!

03:00.714 --> 03:02.448
You're both really
high-strung today.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.616
Don't you have a happy place
in your imagination, Ock?

03:04.618 --> 03:07.586
Like a laboratory with pictures
of your own face all around it?

03:07.588 --> 03:08.431
(GRUNTS)

03:08.432 --> 03:10.713
Always making jokes, Spider-Man.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.425
I find nothing funny
about the serious situation

03:13.427 --> 03:14.960
in which we find ourselves.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.528
Oh, so that's why you're not laughing?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.564
'Cause I think I'm pretty
hilarious, actually.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.896
SCARLET SPIDER: You're not.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.871
I missed you, Scarlet.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.244
DR. OCTOPUS: There may be
more automated traps ahead.

03:32.246 --> 03:36.547
Perhaps try staying focused,
Spiders, if you are capable.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.474
And I thought this place was creepy
when it was floating in the sky.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.387
Get out of the way!

03:42.389 --> 03:43.889
Interesting.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.592
- I express my gratitude.
- You're welcome.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.128
Wait. Doc Ock thanked me?

03:49.130 --> 03:50.295
What have you done with the real Otto?

03:50.297 --> 03:52.631
There are certain situations

03:52.633 --> 03:55.834
where such social
interactions are logical.

03:55.836 --> 04:00.203
You know so very little about
me, don't you, Spider-Man?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.218
SPIDER-MAN: Um, is that
a trick question?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.413
I'm tired of all this.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.983
Where are my answers, Ock?

04:10.985 --> 04:16.154
Patience. We are almost to the lab
that holds the secrets of your past.

04:16.156 --> 04:16.940
(GRUNTS)

04:16.966 --> 04:18.966
I just want to know the truth.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.360
You're losing control of yourself, Ben.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.962
Whatever we find here,
it doesn't change anything.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.431
No matter who you were before or
how they gave you your powers,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.767
where you started is not
where you are today.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.669
You can't let the past destroy you.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.784
(GRUNTS) That's easy for you to say.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.542
No. Trust me. Given my
history, not so easy.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.043
(GRUNTING)

04:38.045 --> 04:40.312
Oh, great. We woke the neighbors.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.714
The really mean-looking neighbors.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.825
Okay. What are these things?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.512
I'm gonna say they're the trap
Ock's been leading us into.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.514
Halt, Delta-Nine.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.535
They are not a trap.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.705
These are the most advanced
synthezoids ever created.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.342
I designed them, but Zola was
the one that finished them.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.538
I'll simply command them to assist us.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.647
You have no control over us.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.984
Slayers, destroy Spider-Man!

05:18.986 --> 05:20.886
Gonna enjoy that.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.355
Come on, punk.
I'm itching to fight.

05:23.357 --> 05:27.004
Zola's locked me out of the
Spider-Slayers' voice commands.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.061
(GRUNTS)

05:34.067 --> 05:35.637
Spider-Slayers?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.035
(GRUNTS)

05:37.037 --> 05:38.604
It's hard not to take
that name personally.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.373
They were designed for one purpose.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.876
Kinda guessed that. Next time, can
I suggest Spider-Buddies instead?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.445
DR. OCTOPUS: That is Bone Spider.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.414
I believe the reasons
for that name will be clear.

05:49.416 --> 05:50.118
(GRUNTS)

05:50.143 --> 05:51.107
Painfully.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.453
(ROARS)
(GRUNTS)

05:55.355 --> 05:58.357
Destroy Spider-Man's allies!

05:58.359 --> 06:00.859
The armored one is Goliath Spider.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.428
Hah. This one is Ghost Spider.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.330
So you do know me.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.333
(SCREAMS)

06:13.106 --> 06:14.803
Guys, I need your help.

06:14.908 --> 06:19.111
MJ? What are you doing here?
The training room's dangerous.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.747
Spidey's in trouble, and we're
the only ones who can help him.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.282
- What happened?
- He's with Doc Ock

06:23.284 --> 06:25.484
and Scarlet Spider down in Hydra Island.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.553
Scarlet? How is that traitor still alive?

06:28.555 --> 06:32.324
Long story. But Spidey's convinced
Ock's leading them into a trap.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.359
And we've got to save them.
So let's go.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.429
MJ, we got this.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.498
You don't understand
how dangerous it could be.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.300
And you don't have the skills we do.

06:41.302 --> 06:42.522
MARY JANE: No?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.606
(BOTH GASP)

06:47.608 --> 06:48.615
Yah!

06:48.616 --> 06:49.753
(BOTH GRUNT)

06:51.678 --> 06:53.969
Well, I vote she goes.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.848

06:59.485 --> 07:00.652
(GROWLS)

07:08.953 --> 07:09.926
(GRUNTS)

07:09.927 --> 07:11.359
This is fun.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.338
Scarlet!

07:21.007 --> 07:22.407
(GRUNTING)

07:28.014 --> 07:31.450
When I get close to these things, it...
It makes me angrier.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.852
As they were designed to, Scarlet.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.939
Destroy!

07:38.491 --> 07:39.791
What's this all about, Ock?

07:43.029 --> 07:45.130
(GRUNTING)

07:47.367 --> 07:48.467
(GROANS)

07:50.903 --> 07:53.972
You're looking at Zola's Weapon S program.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.271
These three Slayers and their commander...

07:57.464 --> 07:59.115
You, Scarlet.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.645
(GRUNTING)

08:01.981 --> 08:03.048
(GROANS)

08:04.650 --> 08:05.489
(PANTING)

08:05.514 --> 08:07.819
You two brainwashed me,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.521
stole my memories,

08:09.523 --> 08:12.424
to lead a synthezoid hit squad?

08:12.426 --> 08:16.161
Scarlet, only humans
have memories to steal.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.093
You are a synthezoid, just
like your Slayer brothers.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.338
(GASPS)

08:21.582 --> 08:22.527
What?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.975
I'm not human?

08:26.205 --> 08:27.587
That's impossible.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.575
You wanted the truth.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.412
I knew you would not believe me
unless you saw the Slayers yourself.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.099
Now you understand your true purpose.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.318
(GROANS)

08:46.225 --> 08:47.859
(GRUNTS)

08:50.630 --> 08:52.898
Scarlet, I need help!

08:52.900 --> 08:54.287
Scarlet!

08:58.070 --> 09:01.606
No. This... This can't be true.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.141
Ock has to be lying.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.378
(SHOUTS) No!

09:06.380 --> 09:08.393
Scarlet, snap out of it!

09:08.449 --> 09:08.991
(GRUNTS)

09:09.016 --> 09:10.616
So you might be a synthezoid

09:10.617 --> 09:12.884
programed by a madman
to do his evil bidding?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.286
I agree, it's harsh,

09:14.288 --> 09:16.555
but can we process it all later?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.957
I need help now!

09:18.959 --> 09:20.392
(YELLS)

09:22.995 --> 09:26.631
Okay. Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.300
(GRUNTS)
Scarlet!

09:29.402 --> 09:31.636
You hug your mom with those spikes?

09:31.638 --> 09:34.573
(GROWLS)
(DR. OCTOPUS GRUNTS)

09:34.575 --> 09:36.382
Uh, thanks.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.244
We are now even, partner.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.218
Ugh. That just sounds creepy.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.615
(GROWLS)

09:43.617 --> 09:44.483

(GROANING)

09:52.158 --> 09:53.725
(GRUNTING)

09:55.695 --> 09:59.998
If you want my help, Ock,
admit it. You're lying.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.533
I am not one of these things.

10:01.535 --> 10:05.604
It is true, you are different,
but you are one of them.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.139
All your memories? Implanted.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.508
But I'm not like them!

10:09.510 --> 10:14.546
Your synth DNA was mixed
with too much Spider-Man DNA.

10:14.548 --> 10:17.616
That's why you're so conflicted
about your true mission.

10:17.618 --> 10:21.453
These things? Zola
removed all humanity.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.488
So they're just monsters!

10:23.490 --> 10:25.657
(GRUNTS)

10:25.659 --> 10:27.882
Nothing wrong with monsters.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.731
Like that scar?
Guess who gave it to you!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.766
(BOTH GRUNTING)

10:38.304 --> 10:40.405
Spidey, when I get near them, my...

10:40.407 --> 10:43.041
My animal side takes over.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.676
Huh? Ock!

10:44.678 --> 10:46.344
You traitor!

10:46.346 --> 10:47.712
Scarlet, fight your anger.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.415
This is exactly the trap
Ock wants you to fall into.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.700
Finally, all of my nanotech
research back in my hands.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.002
(GROANING)

11:12.271 --> 11:14.606
Now, this is how my nanotech

11:14.608 --> 11:17.576
was originally designed to work.

11:17.578 --> 11:18.677
SPIDER-WOMAN: I don't understand.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.212
You said you saw where
Hydra Island went down.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.182
Yes, but the entire fortress must
have some sort of radar cloak

11:24.184 --> 11:26.618
that's still active.
We can't dive into it blindly.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.187
We'd get lost.
And time is of the essence.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.756
Didn't think being a superhero
meant so much waiting.

SPIDER-MAN: Well, it was
only a matter of when,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.532
not if, Ock was going to abandon us.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.568
Let's remember not to send
him a "thank you" note.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.739
Something inside me is holding me back.

Nope. Nothing inside you.

(GROANS)

12:59.345 --> 13:01.513
You. You came back.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.348
I am a man of my word.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.719
A man who is worthy of the respect you
have always refused to accord me.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.788
Can your nanotech build us some cages?

13:09.790 --> 13:12.709
My nanotech can do anything.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.135
The trap is complete.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.971
Okay, push them back.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.476
SPIDER-MAN: One point
team Spider-Man.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.245
Zero points Spider-Slayer.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.238
Huh?

13:38.384 --> 13:39.921

Huh?

13:48.977 --> 13:50.953
(HISSES)

13:51.864 --> 13:53.665
Bring it on, punk.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.908
Not that you can blame me, but maybe
there's more to you than I realized, Ock.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.276
Yes, well,

14:05.278 --> 14:09.447
there is one more person
I want to hear say that.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.518
(STAMMERS) <i>What?</i>

14:13.520 --> 14:15.787
<i>Otto Octavius?</i>

<i>Where... Where am I?</i>

14:19.358 --> 14:20.692
Well, this can't end well.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.261
Trapped in your island creation.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.396
I wanted you to see with your own eyes

14:25.398 --> 14:28.800
that no one imprisons
me, Zola. No one!

14:28.802 --> 14:30.201
You used me.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.763
Took my research.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.806
But now I've just taken it back.

14:34.808 --> 14:39.077
<i>You foolish little man.</i>

14:39.079 --> 14:42.514
<i>Do not dare to defy me!</i>

14:43.949 --> 14:45.950
Hmm.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.622
Uh, where you going there, partner?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.924
As a man of my word,

14:52.926 --> 14:55.960
I honored the deal we made, Spiders.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.221
But our partnership has now ended.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.063
Find your own way back from this tomb.

15:01.481 --> 15:02.569
Hey!

15:05.404 --> 15:08.573
Funny. I've never been disappointed
to see Ock leave before.

15:08.575 --> 15:13.111
ZOLA: <i>You arrogant fool, Octavius.</i>

15:13.113 --> 15:14.646
<i>How do you say...</i>

15:14.648 --> 15:17.440
<i>You should have let the sleeping dog lie.</i>

15:17.517 --> 15:21.519
<i>You've given me precisely what I needed.</i>

searching for the island.

IRON SPIDER: Uh-oh. Its weapon

16:10.403 --> 16:11.803

16:36.929 --> 16:39.342
Um, can we talk about this?

16:40.866 --> 16:42.433
We have one chance.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.933
Ock said I was supposed
to lead these things.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.789
Maybe it's time I do just that.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.578
Scarlet, you're not one of them.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.906
Stay away from your evil side.

You have no fear.

he's still a bad guy.

I had to face my own darkness so I

Couldn't have done it

- Why? You didn't trust me?

Without Zola's subroutines
keeping the systems going,

they really saved the day.

Now the future is up to him.
