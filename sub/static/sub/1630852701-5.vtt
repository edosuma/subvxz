WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.958
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:53.708 --> 00:54.791
Sofía.

00:55.958 --> 00:57.083
What happened?

01:01.041 --> 01:02.458
Where have you been?

01:02.541 --> 01:05.333
Come by my office in a few days
so I can see how you're doing.

01:05.416 --> 01:06.250
And the dressing?

01:06.333 --> 01:10.375
Clean the wound, dry it, let it air dry
a few hours before applying the bandage.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.458
-The stitches need to dry.
-Okay.

01:12.958 --> 01:14.958
And take one of these every eight hours.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.291
-It'll help you relax.
-Okay.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.166
Sofía.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.958
-Hi.
-Estrella said to bring you this.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.500
Thanks.

01:27.166 --> 01:30.666
Your sister decided
to start her acting career today.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.833
You should've seen her take
on Jack Nicholson in <i>The Shining</i>.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.458
Careful. It hurts a little.

01:39.583 --> 01:40.750
What did you do?

01:42.958 --> 01:43.916
I don't know.

01:44.625 --> 01:48.375
During the interview, I could've sworn
I had something under my skin.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.708
And I got
this brilliant idea to dig it out.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.000
She stabbed herself with scissors.

01:56.541 --> 01:58.416
Guess insanity runs in the family.

02:00.541 --> 02:02.208
I wouldn't joke about that.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.333
You've been under a lot of pressure.

02:09.625 --> 02:12.333
-Want me to walk you out, Dr. Belda?
-Take care of her.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.291
Make sure she takes her meds
and gets rest.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.958
-Hey.
-Thanks, Doctor.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.291
It's fine. I'm okay.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.666
Turns out you were right.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.041
The interview was a dumbass idea.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.875
And Ana Sánchez <i>is </i>a bitch.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.750
Don't touch her, you bastards!

03:02.333 --> 03:04.500
Get him out of here,
and make sure he stays out!

03:06.333 --> 03:07.333
Sofía!

03:09.291 --> 03:10.916
Leave him alone!

03:12.291 --> 03:13.958
Sofía, you need to get out of here.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.458
You're so close now, Sofía.
Don't throw it all away.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.250
You're a bunch of lunatics!

03:23.875 --> 03:25.083
Sofía.

03:36.958 --> 03:38.208
Don't hurt him.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.583
They drugged you! This is fucking insane!

03:44.666 --> 03:46.041
They're gonna kill you!

03:52.666 --> 03:55.875
Yaldabaoth saw his reflection
in the light.

03:55.958 --> 03:59.041
And the reflection came to life
and became the universe.

03:59.541 --> 04:02.041
But a lesser god, a blind god,

04:02.125 --> 04:05.250
thought he could mimic
Yaldabaoth's creations

04:05.333 --> 04:07.541
and made this world of shadows.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.833
This prison.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.041
He created desire.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.750
And he created love.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.250
And he created guilt and pain.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.750
And death.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.125
And the chains that bind us all.

04:22.791 --> 04:24.333
But none of that is real.

04:25.583 --> 04:26.875
It's all a trick.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.541
A lie to keep us from escaping this place.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.166
So how can I stop being afraid?

04:34.666 --> 04:35.875
You won't be alone.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.166
Your mother will be with you.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.000
Sofía.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.000
Honey.

05:10.958 --> 05:13.208
Complete the five veils.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.416
Mom.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.666
Come to me.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.250
I need you.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.250
I need you too.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.125
What just happened?

06:04.375 --> 06:05.458
Was that real?

06:06.958 --> 06:08.125
She wasn't okay.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.916
-Something was wrong with her.
-Sofía.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.958
In the kingdom, there is no pain.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.250
All you have to do is reach the end.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.583
Lord Jesus Christ,

07:09.083 --> 07:11.416
you said to your apostles,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.916
"I leave you peace, my peace I give you."

07:15.416 --> 07:19.291
Look not on our sins
but on the faith of your Church,

07:19.791 --> 07:21.208
and grant us

07:21.791 --> 07:24.791
the peace and unity

07:24.875 --> 07:29.125
of your kingdom
where you live for ever and ever.

07:29.208 --> 07:32.041
-Amen.
-The peace of the Lord be with you always.

07:32.541 --> 07:33.833
And also with you.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.291
Let us offer each other a sign of peace.

07:52.333 --> 07:56.833
As much as people liked Father Ezcaray,
his Masses were over two hours long.

07:56.916 --> 07:58.000
This is much better.

08:05.416 --> 08:07.041
-Peace be with you.
-Peace.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.500
-How's Eva?
-The wound isn't the issue.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.958
The problem's up here.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.291
-Ascensión.
-Pedro. Peace be with you.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.375
How are you?

08:19.625 --> 08:23.125
Where's your son, Pedro?
You should get him to come to Mass.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.791
Kids today, you couldn't pay them
to come to church.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.958
<i>Establishing Christianity</i>
<i>wasn't a cakewalk.</i>

08:29.041 --> 08:32.500
There were many groups
with different beliefs, like Valentinus's,

08:32.583 --> 08:35.750
which came about in the 2nd century A.D.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.416
It was based on a simple idea.

08:38.916 --> 08:41.166
What kind of God
would create a world like ours,

08:41.250 --> 08:43.166
where there's war and pain?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.916
He never considered
that maybe there is no God?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.958
And everything is our own fault?

08:48.458 --> 08:53.458
No, Valentinus believed our world
was created by a cruel, stupid God.

08:53.541 --> 08:57.541
A God who sends plagues,
demands sacrifices, and destroys Babylon.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.625
He wasn't so far off there.
The bastard had a hell of a temper.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.583
And he believed
humans can escape this world

09:03.666 --> 09:05.416
and return to the real one.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.625
The kingdom.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.500
But to do that,
they have to attain… gnosis.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.458
GNOSTIC GOSPELS

09:11.541 --> 09:13.583
Something like true knowledge.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.916
That's what they did at the mine.

09:17.416 --> 09:19.541
Killed themselves to go
to that other world.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.583
Except not everyone can do it.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.916
According to Gnosticism,
there are three types of human beings.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.583
<i>The perfect ones.</i>

09:29.083 --> 09:31.375
<i>Their spirit prevails over the flesh.</i>

09:31.458 --> 09:34.375
<i>They're the ones who are called</i>
<i>to open the gates of the kingdom.</i>

09:35.958 --> 09:37.083
<i>The psychics.</i>

09:37.166 --> 09:39.333
<i>They're not aware they're being deceived,</i>

09:39.416 --> 09:42.083
<i>but they can learn</i>
<i>by following a perfect one.</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:45.875
And then the somatics,
the ones beyond redemption.

09:45.958 --> 09:48.375
They're ruled by the physical world, so…

09:48.875 --> 09:50.041
They're doomed.

09:50.541 --> 09:52.000
I guess that'd be you and me.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.125
Who'd believe this bullshit?

10:36.375 --> 10:39.291
Don't you understand?
She wants to be here.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.708
You scumbags.
You drugged her so you could rape her.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.750
You're not going to say a word.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.583
You were never here.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.666
You don't know who we are.

10:53.166 --> 10:57.125
Say it. You don't know who we are.

10:58.916 --> 11:00.125
I don't know who you are.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.416
Attaboy.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.666
Didn't he do a good job?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.708
Sofía wants you to leave.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.083
And that's what you're going to do.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.791
But if you say a word to anyone,

11:14.875 --> 11:17.291
we'll have to come after you.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.000
Is that clear?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.333
Is that clear?

11:40.416 --> 11:43.000
When did you get home? I was worried.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.750
I was getting shots for <i>Bloody Feria</i>.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.041
-You're going back out?
-I forgot something.

12:11.541 --> 12:14.666
Sofía isn't home.
I think she's out with Estrella.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.333
Yeah, I saw her leave.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.916
But actually, I'm here to see you.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.583
I just took a pill,
so I'm pretty out of it.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.583
-What happened to you?
-Want some coffee?

12:24.666 --> 12:26.291
I need you awake for this.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.333
Go over all the missing persons reports
from the past two years.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.166
This woman didn't appear out of nowhere.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.583
We still need to ID three victims.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.375
I'll have them get right on it.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.416
Thanks.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.583
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.916
About the corporal,
what will happen to him?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.666
-He's not here yet?
-No. Called in sick. Said he had a fever.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.291
Marcos… is a good cop.

13:22.791 --> 13:25.000
He'd have his reasons
for searching the sacristy.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.125
Talking to him should clear it all up.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.833
All this to save Ezcaray's reputation.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.375
So no one would find out
he had a thing for boys.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.375
The town's had enough bad press as it is.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.125
Leave it to me. I'll see what I can do.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.625
-And get started on that photo.
-Okay.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.625
Now who's gonna carry my detectors for me?

13:48.500 --> 13:49.458
Mani?

13:49.958 --> 13:51.541
He's in the holding cell.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.208
He's a good kid.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.375
Bit of a druggie, but a good kid.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.958
Who will I get to help me now?

13:58.291 --> 14:00.416
People are so sly.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.833
The second they find the orichalcum,
they'll split my skull and take it.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.500
Smoking again?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.250
With those black lungs of yours?

14:22.125 --> 14:24.208
I can't stay forever, Serafín.

14:27.750 --> 14:28.833
I have to go.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.166
Estrella asked me about Dad.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.916
I think she thinks I know where he is.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.458
Are you okay?

14:50.916 --> 14:52.166
Have you lost your mind?

14:53.291 --> 14:55.458
I thought I was the only one
who did dumb shit.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.416
Do you want me to be alone?

15:00.500 --> 15:04.541
After everything with Mom and Dad?
You want to off yourself too?

15:05.041 --> 15:06.916
Don't you give a shit about me?

15:07.916 --> 15:09.583
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.166
Stop treating me like I'm an idiot.

15:14.750 --> 15:15.958
Chisco was here.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.125
He told me what you did.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.500
-I'm not sure what he--
-Don't bullshit me.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.333
I know you've been seeing cult members.

15:27.416 --> 15:29.250
Chisco's scared to death.

15:30.291 --> 15:34.041
Did you see what your friends did to him?
They smashed his face in.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.458
-You wouldn't understand.
-You're right.

15:37.541 --> 15:40.333
-Why are you with those psychopaths?
-They're not psychopaths!

15:40.416 --> 15:41.541
Jesus, Sofía!

15:42.458 --> 15:43.875
Did they brainwash you?

15:45.458 --> 15:48.208
We're going to the cops.
You're gonna tell them who they are.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.583
I'm not going anywhere.
And neither are you.

15:51.666 --> 15:52.666
Or what?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
So, you're okay
with what they did to Chisco?

15:56.583 --> 15:58.500
Do you want them to do the same to me?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.500
Eva.

16:10.291 --> 16:11.583
I've been an idiot.

16:16.833 --> 16:20.750
I was so focused on me,
I didn't see what was happening to you.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.375
But that ends now.
I'm going to take care of you.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.791
If you're serious, then don't tell anyone.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.583
They'll split us up.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.708
Put me in some facility or an asylum.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.708
-No, they won't.
-They will.

16:47.208 --> 16:49.625
They promised they'd take me to Mom.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.125
And I fell for it like a sucker.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.416
But, Sofía,

16:57.041 --> 16:58.333
how could you?

17:01.833 --> 17:03.833
I miss her so much, Eva.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.958
I don't have strength left without Mom.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.083
I'm here for you, Sofía.

17:12.708 --> 17:13.916
I love you.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.500
I promise we're gonna get through this.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.250
How?

17:19.541 --> 17:21.625
Can you bring Mom and Dad back?

17:25.958 --> 17:28.250
It's probably these pills they gave me.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.208
I'm about to do
something seriously stupid.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.666
But first, you have to promise.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.250
Never see those people again.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.375
Ever.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.041
-I only saw them that one time.
-Sofía.

17:45.791 --> 17:46.875
I promise.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.458
Okay, I'll tell Estrella

17:50.583 --> 17:53.416
we're going to Seville
to get away for a while.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.625
Once we're there,
we'll tell them everything.

18:12.083 --> 18:16.375
<i>María, how can the listeners</i>
<i>of </i>Confessions in the Semidarkness <i>help?</i>

18:16.875 --> 18:20.750
<i>It happened to me when I was a girl,</i>
<i>but I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

18:20.833 --> 18:22.166
<i>They probably think I'm nuts.</i>

18:48.875 --> 18:49.875
SEE EACH OTHER SOON

18:49.958 --> 18:51.333
<i>It's the symbol of Saturn.</i>

18:51.416 --> 18:53.708
<i>It also resembles</i>
<i>a letter of the Coptic alphabet.</i>

18:53.791 --> 18:56.375
-Right. That's the tattoo they all had.
-Who?

18:56.458 --> 18:57.625
The mine victims.

18:58.125 --> 19:01.166
It's associated with a Gnostic god,
Yaldabaoth.

19:01.666 --> 19:02.666
Here.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.625
Don't look at me.
I didn't choose the name.

19:05.708 --> 19:08.833
Where is this leading us?
We already knew they were nuts.

19:08.916 --> 19:12.625
I'm not surprised they believed in a snake
with a lion's head floating in space.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.875
-Can you guys take the tarp down?
-Sure.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.416
A while back, I asked Ezcaray
to show me the altarpiece.

19:19.500 --> 19:23.166
It's been covered
since I moved here, and I was curious.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.000
Candela's father,
who was the mayor of Feria,

19:26.083 --> 19:27.291
was paying for the restoration.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.958
But when he died,
no one would pick up the slack.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.291
See?

19:42.250 --> 19:44.625
Is that crazy or what?

19:56.291 --> 19:59.500
How long has the Cult of Light
been in this town anyway?

20:32.833 --> 20:33.833
Does it hurt?

20:41.958 --> 20:42.958
Kinda.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.750
Did you tell Eva everything?

20:55.083 --> 20:59.166
It's like there's this pain in my head.
It won't let me think.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.458
Chisco, please.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.583
I need to know.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.958
Did I tell her you were raped?

21:12.666 --> 21:13.666
No, I didn't.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.166
Don't ask me why. I don't even know.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.083
I guess I thought
you should be the one to tell her.

21:21.583 --> 21:24.166
If I had, she would've had a heart attack.

21:28.958 --> 21:31.291
All that happened because I wanted it to.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.750
Those people will hurt you.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.291
Just look what they did to me.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.583
I could see her, Chisco.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.208
I saw my mother.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.875
Those blindfolds they put on us were wet.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.458
They were soaked in something.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.500
That's why we saw what we saw.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.166
You're bent on denying the truth.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.166
Eva wants us to leave.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.958
But I can't.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.583
I have to stay.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.375
This is what I want.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.583
What are you doing?

22:47.083 --> 22:48.250
Don't you want my body?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.083
-Take it.
-It's you that I want!

22:50.875 --> 22:52.875
BLOODY FERIA

22:52.958 --> 22:54.583
You don't get it, do you?

22:56.541 --> 22:59.708
I've been in love with you
since they sat us together in first grade.

23:01.208 --> 23:03.250
I'm sick of being just friends.

23:04.333 --> 23:08.041
I'm done being the funny guy
who makes crappy movies you can laugh at.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.125
I'm done.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.458
I want you to love me for real.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.250
I can't do that.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.208
I'm a joke, right?

23:23.875 --> 23:25.958
How could you love a guy
with a face like mine?

23:26.041 --> 23:27.458
No. It's not like that.

23:28.791 --> 23:29.875
It's not.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.000
Just go, please.

23:31.916 --> 23:32.916
Get out of here.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.208
Don't worry. I'll keep my mouth shut.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.666
Like they told me to.
That's why you're here, right?

23:42.875 --> 23:44.041
Don't touch me!

23:45.750 --> 23:47.000
You got what you wanted.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.000
Now leave, Sofía.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.083
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

24:14.666 --> 24:16.833
But you must free yourself, Sofía.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.791
Your mother is waiting.

24:46.875 --> 24:50.291
-<i>Are you gonna cast me in your movie?</i>
-<i>Of course. You're a true artist.</i>

25:07.500 --> 25:09.541
-<i>Well, I'll have to think about it.</i>
-<i>Why?</i>

25:09.625 --> 25:11.333
<i>You're not a great director.</i>

25:12.041 --> 25:16.500
-<i>You're too demanding.</i>
-<i>That's 'cause I put effort into it.</i>

25:34.416 --> 25:36.208
They were looking for something.

25:36.958 --> 25:40.041
Just this morning,
we saw the unfinished altarpiece.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.958
What?

25:49.916 --> 25:52.166
-What's going on?
-Mar.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.541
Now's not the time. Go back to your room.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.208
I know your father
commissioned the restoration work.

26:02.916 --> 26:07.416
I looked through the church records,
but there's nothing on that altarpiece.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.458
-Perhaps you--
-No, I don't know anything about that.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.666
Could Ezcaray have been hiding something?

26:17.500 --> 26:18.625
Candela.

26:18.708 --> 26:22.958
That altarpiece is connected
to the cult that caused all those deaths.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.875
What if it happens again?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.458
I know you don't want that.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.666
If anyone knew Ezcaray, it's you.

26:33.791 --> 26:35.250
Look in his notebooks.

26:35.750 --> 26:36.916
Notebooks?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.083
He wrote down everything
ever since he came to Feria.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.833
If he knew something, it'd be in there.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.875
Thank you, Candela.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.250
Dad, I can't stay.

27:34.333 --> 27:37.000
-Can you take Mom to the cemetery?
-You take her.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.166
I've got things I gotta do.
She shouldn't be alone today.

27:41.291 --> 27:45.750
What does it matter when we go?
There's no one in that grave.

27:45.833 --> 27:48.333
Can you think of someone
other than yourself for once?

27:48.416 --> 27:50.166
That's what I'm doing.

27:51.416 --> 27:53.583
-Eva's having a hard time.
-Oh, is that right?

27:53.666 --> 27:55.375
-Yeah.
-And what about your mother?

27:55.458 --> 27:58.250
Uncle Elías has been missing
for 20 years, Dad.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.875
There's no point
in putting birthday flowers

28:00.958 --> 28:02.916
on a grave that doesn't even have a body.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Look, Raúl.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.916
Do us a favor and keep your trap shut.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.125
Got it?

28:20.166 --> 28:21.166
See you later.

28:22.791 --> 28:26.125
-Aren't you off today?
-I have to go down to the station. Sorry.

28:51.916 --> 28:54.041
Son of a bitch.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.208
There's a palace beneath our feet.

28:59.291 --> 29:01.416
The ground up here is hard and dry,

29:01.916 --> 29:03.875
but underneath, it shines.

29:06.583 --> 29:10.916
I figured with everything that's going on,
the girls could use a little gift.

29:15.750 --> 29:16.791
Orichalcum!

29:18.125 --> 29:22.208
I unearthed that nugget in 1975,
the same year they closed the mine.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.375
But there's more. A lot more.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.041
And I'm about to find
the mother lode. So close.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.125
This is for Sofía and you.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.458
Thank you. It's really beautiful.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.291
But you have to promise me
you're going to take care of it.

29:39.291 --> 29:40.791
This is for you alone.

29:41.666 --> 29:42.666
Just for you.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.958
<i>"I need to see you soon."</i>

29:53.541 --> 29:54.500
"Tonight."

29:55.000 --> 29:56.500
"I'm staying with Serafín."

29:57.000 --> 29:58.875
"I have a lot to explain."

29:58.958 --> 30:00.375
"I love you both."

30:00.458 --> 30:02.041
When did he give you this?

30:02.958 --> 30:04.041
Ten minutes ago.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.750
He gave me the nugget and that note.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.833
Dad knew him.

30:10.666 --> 30:13.583
He'd ask Dad to open the mine
to let him search for ori--

30:13.666 --> 30:14.666
Orichalcum.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.208
But I don't know.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.583
Serafín isn't all there.

30:21.708 --> 30:24.458
Eva, Dad is alive.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.208
We have to go
without anyone noticing. Tonight.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.583
We'll just go out the kitchen window.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.666
Eva, what's wrong? Aren't you happy?

30:36.250 --> 30:37.500
Dad's okay!

30:38.916 --> 30:39.875
Yeah.

30:40.541 --> 30:41.916
Of course I'm happy.

30:44.208 --> 30:45.791
I just wasn't expecting this.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.583
Dad will explain everything. You'll see.

31:10.750 --> 31:13.791
Perla, get me a pack of alginate
and a can of talc powder.

31:13.875 --> 31:17.375
Chafing again? You need
to get some more exercise, Chisco.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.916
Sure, whatever you say.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.208
You, I saw your mom on TV.

31:28.166 --> 31:30.000
With Lozano and all that.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.000
She looked fatter.

31:36.541 --> 31:38.333
Maybe you'll get fat too.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.000
Leave me alone.

31:42.833 --> 31:44.375
Perla, you almost got it?

31:44.958 --> 31:47.833
This is how you're gonna get
Sofía to fall for you?

31:49.250 --> 31:50.750
Have you looked in the mirror?

31:56.583 --> 31:58.500
Goddammit, stop laughing!

32:08.791 --> 32:10.458
Don't listen to them, son.

32:45.875 --> 32:47.541
What's taking the doctor so long?

32:48.916 --> 32:50.625
She was just a little upset.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.291
Dr. Belda knows how to treat your mother.

32:54.791 --> 32:58.583
It's not the first time this has happened.
So let them be.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.708
Remember when there was no pain?

33:06.708 --> 33:08.833
When it was all nothing but pleasure?

33:10.625 --> 33:14.125
Whoever has known this world
has found but a corpse.

33:15.333 --> 33:19.916
But this world is not worthy
of he who finds that corpse.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.625
Whoever has known doesn't forget, Candela.

34:14.541 --> 34:15.916
What are we waiting for?

34:18.208 --> 34:19.750
I don't know about this.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.541
-Maybe…
-Maybe what?

34:21.625 --> 34:23.291
Aren't you dying to see Dad?

34:28.750 --> 34:29.958
What are you doing, Sofía?

34:30.041 --> 34:32.500
Hold on. What if we were followed?

34:33.125 --> 34:35.416
-We should go.
-What are you afraid of?

34:35.916 --> 34:38.000
They didn't even notice us leave.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.333
Sofía.

34:53.416 --> 34:54.791
-Dad!
-My little girl!

34:57.166 --> 34:59.000
I missed you both so much.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.125
Eva!

35:03.041 --> 35:03.958
Come here!

35:04.041 --> 35:05.916
Dad!

35:08.166 --> 35:09.166
Eva!

35:11.500 --> 35:12.583
I'm sorry, Dad.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.083
-Freeze!
-Civil Guard!

35:17.166 --> 35:18.666
Freeze! Civil Guard!

35:18.750 --> 35:19.875
Don't move!

35:19.958 --> 35:21.833
-To the right!
-No!

35:21.916 --> 35:23.166
No!

35:23.250 --> 35:25.541
-On the ground!
-Freeze! Don't move!

35:25.625 --> 35:26.750
No! Dad!

35:28.208 --> 35:29.791
Nobody move!

35:29.875 --> 35:32.333
Okay. Sofía, take it easy.

35:32.416 --> 35:33.541
Don't come any closer!

35:33.625 --> 35:35.125
-Pablo.
-I said stay away!

35:35.208 --> 35:36.125
Pablo.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.458
No, Dad! No!

35:39.541 --> 35:41.166
-On your knees! Now!
-No!

35:41.250 --> 35:42.125
Get on the ground!

35:42.208 --> 35:43.875
Let go! Dad!

35:43.958 --> 35:45.083
All right, Sofía.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.291
No!

35:46.375 --> 35:47.416
Eva!

35:48.125 --> 35:49.416
-Eva!
-Sofía.

35:51.083 --> 35:52.250
Eva!

35:56.583 --> 35:57.458
Eva.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.125
Eva!

36:02.000 --> 36:04.750
-Eva.
-Okay, calm down. We're taking you home.

36:14.875 --> 36:16.083
Don't worry.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.666
Watch your head.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.875
Let go of me, you son of a bitch!

36:21.875 --> 36:22.833
Sofía!

36:22.916 --> 36:25.625
-Sofía!
-Go after her!

36:26.125 --> 36:27.625
Search the woods!

36:29.125 --> 36:31.500
-Eva. Come here.
-Sofía.

36:32.750 --> 36:33.750
Sofía.

36:39.666 --> 36:41.625
-Sofía!
-Sofía!

36:59.166 --> 37:00.916
-Sofía!
-Come on, let's go!

37:26.666 --> 37:27.958
Is anyone there?

37:29.333 --> 37:30.666
Please!

37:32.083 --> 37:33.750
Please, help me.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.458
Sofía.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.833
Take me to see Blanca.

38:10.625 --> 38:14.833
CALIFORNIA VIDEO

38:25.833 --> 38:28.291
Leave that for tomorrow
and go to bed. It's late.

38:29.750 --> 38:30.708
Chisco.

38:33.708 --> 38:35.541
Take that thing off. You'll suffocate.

38:38.708 --> 38:41.375
-Wouldn't be so bad.
-Chisco, son…

38:43.958 --> 38:45.708
You think you look better that way?

38:46.208 --> 38:49.333
When are you going to realize
you're a joke, just like me?

38:49.416 --> 38:52.333
-We're the laughingstocks of this town.
-Shut up, Dad!

38:52.416 --> 38:53.916
Why do you think your mom left?

38:54.416 --> 38:56.791
She'd rather die
than be with you, just like Sofía!

38:58.583 --> 39:01.041
Are you gonna shoot me with your toy gun?

39:02.041 --> 39:04.791
-Wanna try it?
-How about you try it on yourself first.

39:30.833 --> 39:34.458
You wouldn't stop staring at her boobs.
Didn't know it was past its sell-by date?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.458
Whoa. What's up with him?

39:39.375 --> 39:41.708
-Where you going, loser?
-Chisco.

39:47.958 --> 39:48.958
What is that?

39:50.541 --> 39:52.000
Your best face?

39:52.500 --> 39:55.416
Go on home.
You'll scare someone with that mug.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.375
-Holy shit!
-He's got a gun. Run!
