00:11.045 --> 00:19.045
(intro music)

00:37.204 --> 00:45.204
(soft joyful music)

01:48.208 --> 01:52.110
Go on, get, outta here!

01:53.046 --> 01:55.780
(triumphant music)

02:48.968 --> 02:50.902
- [Baker] Hi, kids.

02:58.011 --> 03:02.046
Go, go, go, out of here, go!

03:04.851 --> 03:07.285
Go, go on, get out of here!

03:11.692 --> 03:15.360
(screaming)

03:26.573 --> 03:28.806
- [Mutt] Ooo, Jackpot.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.415
It's a little small, but at
least it's better than the cage.

03:39.953 --> 03:43.054
- It doesn't look
like he has an owner.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.789
Maybe it's the universe
saying that we get

03:44.858 --> 03:47.191
another dog, ahh, grab him!

03:49.095 --> 03:51.663
Woo, another dog, yeah!

03:53.300 --> 03:55.700
- [Mutt] Ahh, home sweet home!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.336
(dog barking)

04:00.807 --> 04:02.774
(dogs barking)

04:06.012 --> 04:07.845
(alarm buzzing)

04:21.127 --> 04:23.295
- [Baron] Watch where
you're going kid,

04:23.363 --> 04:25.062
where's the respect, huh?

04:25.131 --> 04:26.464
- Morning, Baron!

04:26.533 --> 04:28.333
- [Baron] Hmmph!

04:34.841 --> 04:36.207
- [Michelle] Good morning, Mutt!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.310
- [Mutt] Morning, Michelle,
it's a beautiful day,

04:38.378 --> 04:40.712
and I love my new home!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.113
- [Michelle] I'll
see you soon, boy!

04:42.182 --> 04:44.582
- [Mutt] Okay, okay, if
you want to come out,

04:44.651 --> 04:46.751
and play I'll be right out here!

04:46.820 --> 04:50.087
Or, or, maybe by the
back door, all right?

04:50.156 --> 04:52.357
- [Michelle] (giggles)
You're so funny.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.225
- [Mutt] You're
the best Michelle!

04:54.294 --> 04:57.495
- [Ameilia] Breakfast!
- [Michelle] Coming.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.767
- [Bruce] It's my ball,
I shared it with you!

05:02.836 --> 05:04.268
- [Sonny] Yeah, you got
kibble between your ears.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.169
- [Bruce] No I don't!

05:05.238 --> 05:06.358
- [Sonny] I told you before,

05:06.406 --> 05:07.806
you can't be running
around like that.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.507
If you wanna play
catch, we play catch,

05:09.576 --> 05:11.776
you don't go running in
circles around the yard.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.578
- [Bruce] I wasn't running
in circles around the yard,

05:13.647 --> 05:18.015
oh, come on, Sonny, it's my
ball, I wanna play catch!

05:18.084 --> 05:20.084
Oh, Hi Michelle!

05:23.357 --> 05:25.122
- What are you
two arguing about?

05:25.191 --> 05:26.023
- [Bruce] We're not arguing!

05:26.092 --> 05:27.258
- You guys are brothers,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.026
you shouldn't still be
arguing over a bone.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.462
- [Mutt] What's up Michelle?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.610
- [Bruce] Yeah, but Sonny
took my ball, it's my ball!

05:32.632 --> 05:33.712
We were playing catch,

05:33.767 --> 05:34.899
and then Sonny took
it away from me.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.134
Ooo food, hey, Sonny,
come on over here,

05:37.203 --> 05:38.302
get in some of this food.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.170
- [Michelle] Here
you are darling.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.205
- [Mutt] Aww, thank you!

05:42.442 --> 05:44.108
- [Bruce] Aww, what about us?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.845
Aww, come on, I'm
hungry too, aww!

05:46.913 --> 05:49.313
Well I'm sorry, please come on!

05:49.383 --> 05:50.482
- [Sonny] Look, do
you always have to be

05:50.550 --> 05:51.649
such a melonhead?

05:51.718 --> 05:52.918
- [Bruce] I'm not a melonhead!

05:52.952 --> 05:55.019
- [Sonny] Hey, that's
enough, enough!

05:55.088 --> 05:56.521
- [Bruce] But it's
my favorite ball!

05:56.590 --> 05:58.189
- [Sonny] I'm not
telling you again,

05:58.258 --> 05:59.957
You're not getting the ball.
- [Bruce] Aww, come on!

06:00.026 --> 06:01.225
- [News Reporter] And
now, a breaking world

06:01.294 --> 06:04.328
animal news report,
this just in:

06:04.398 --> 06:07.899
Pets around town have
mysteriously gone missing.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.201
The numbers: Staggering.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.771
The reason? Unknown!

06:12.839 --> 06:15.440
I know I'll be locking
up my pooch tonight,

06:15.509 --> 06:18.209
and I suggest everyone
else does the same.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.211
This has been a
breaking news report

06:20.280 --> 06:22.980
from MJ Roth, back to you, Tom!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.583
- Can you believe that, Mutt?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.685
- [Mutt] I'll check the house!

06:29.188 --> 06:31.389
- [Bruce] Hey Sonny,
here comes that guy!

06:31.458 --> 06:32.824
- [Sonny] Not again!

06:32.893 --> 06:34.292
- [Bruce] Huh? What?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.927
- [Sonny] You don't listen.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.730
Boss said, he's
not to be touched.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.165
I want no part of
this, I'm out of here.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.168
- [Mutt] Who is that guy, Sonny?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.771
- [Bruce] Come on, Mutt!

06:47.974 --> 06:50.074
- [Mutt] Coming!
- [Bruce] Hurry up!

06:50.143 --> 06:51.810
- [Mutt] Are we playing a game?

06:51.878 --> 06:53.244
- [Bruce] Get him, boy!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.273
- [Sonny] Would you
look at this, ugh!

06:55.281 --> 06:57.849
- [Bruce] Yeah,
you'd better run!

06:57.918 --> 07:01.586
- [Sonny] Gotta hand it
to him, that kid can run!

07:01.655 --> 07:05.156
- [Bruce] Nah nah nah na
naaa naah! hahahahaha!

07:05.224 --> 07:07.425
- [Sonny] I can't
believe he's my brother!

07:07.494 --> 07:09.894
What a melonhead!

07:13.166 --> 07:15.600
(bouncy music)

07:17.971 --> 07:20.972
- [Bone] I smell some
human strays, check it out!

07:21.040 --> 07:22.474
- [Chloey] No worries mon!

07:22.542 --> 07:24.241
- [Bone] Make sure
they get the hint.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.010
I don't like to be disturbed,

07:26.079 --> 07:28.212
especially during my nap time!

07:28.281 --> 07:31.883
- [Cassey] Those
humans make me nervous,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.819
make them go away!

07:40.760 --> 07:44.261
- [Chloey] Haha! It's chill
mon, you no come back!

07:45.765 --> 07:48.132
- [Cassey] Are they gone, Bone?

07:48.201 --> 07:51.736
Ohh, I hope they
don't come back!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.605
- [Tank] Yeah Bone?

07:53.673 --> 07:56.975
I smell that
dogcatcher guy, again!

07:58.945 --> 08:01.946
(quirky music)

08:39.818 --> 08:44.488
- [JT] That's him all
right, I can smell him!

08:44.558 --> 08:47.025
That net keeps getting bigger.

08:47.093 --> 08:50.728
- [Granite] D'uh, where is
he, I don't see nothing!

08:50.797 --> 08:52.764
- [Bone] Better move on, Copper,

08:52.832 --> 08:56.000
or I'll do to you what
I did to that mailman!

09:01.708 --> 09:05.843
- [Cassey] I'm too
fragile for doggy jail.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.318
- [Bone] Okay, be ready for him.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.994
- [JT] What are we
going to do, Bone?

09:23.063 --> 09:27.264
He's getting closer and closer.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.801
I can smell him!

09:29.869 --> 09:33.071
- [Chloey] Shhh.

09:33.139 --> 09:38.076
Chill out mon, be very
quiet, he gon go away.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.632
- [Guts] Come on, Bruce,
get the ball already!

10:00.700 --> 10:02.266
- [Bruce] I'm
trying! I'm trying!

10:02.335 --> 10:03.901
- [Guts] You know we're
not allowed in the pool.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.403
- [Bruce] Yeah, okay,
too much hair and all,

10:06.472 --> 10:08.106
but woohoo, is this fun!

10:08.174 --> 10:10.108
- [Guts] Stop messing
around, Bruce!

10:10.176 --> 10:12.209
- [Bruce] Okay,
okay, hold the ball,

10:12.278 --> 10:14.078
I'll grab it in my mouth.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.047
- [Guts] All right,
I'm biting it!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.749
- [Bruce] Guts!
This isn't dinner,

10:17.817 --> 10:19.416
hold the ball, don't eat it!

10:19.485 --> 10:21.585
- [Guts] Okay! Let me try again.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.154
- [Bruce] I think I got it!

10:23.222 --> 10:24.321
- [Guts] It's getting away!

10:24.390 --> 10:25.523
- [Heft] What are
you guys doing?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.158
You're not supposed
to be in the pool!

10:27.226 --> 10:28.492
You'll get us all in trouble!

10:28.561 --> 10:30.061
- [Guts] Yeah, we
know, the hair n' all.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.295
- [Bruce] But the ball fell in!

10:31.364 --> 10:32.764
- [Guts] Bruce threw
it in the pool!

10:32.832 --> 10:35.800
- [Bruce] I did not, quit
making up stories, Guts!

10:35.869 --> 10:38.736
Anyway, I'll have this
ball out in a jiffy!

10:38.805 --> 10:42.373
- [Guts] Phew, all this
work has made me so hungry!

10:42.441 --> 10:44.642
I could eat this ball!

10:44.711 --> 10:47.444
- [Bruce] Geesh! If
this ball were food,

10:47.513 --> 10:50.214
we'd have had it out ages ago!

10:58.091 --> 11:00.324
- [Ameilia] Hello?

11:00.393 --> 11:01.826
Hello?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.061
- [Michelle] What's up?

11:03.129 --> 11:04.495
- [Ameilia] (sigh)
Okay, I don't think

11:04.564 --> 11:05.830
you're going to like this,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.865
but unless a big lump of
cash falls into my lap,

11:07.934 --> 11:09.500
I'm going to have to
close Doggy Daycare.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.335
- How is that even possible?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.171
Mom and Dad handled it easy!

11:13.239 --> 11:14.772
- [Ameilia] Yeah, yeah,
they handled it easy,

11:14.841 --> 11:16.373
but you know, Mom
and Dad also gave

11:16.442 --> 11:17.641
all their money to charity,

11:17.711 --> 11:18.810
and God bless their souls,

11:18.878 --> 11:21.713
but this place isn't cheap.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.781
- There's rich people
all over the world!

11:23.783 --> 11:27.651
I'm sure they'll be able to
help human's best friend!

11:27.721 --> 11:29.386
What about all those
stars who used to bring

11:29.455 --> 11:31.089
their dogs here back in the day?

11:31.157 --> 11:32.389
- That's a good idea.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.624
Let me look through
the client's list,

11:33.693 --> 11:37.161
and see what I can do,
I just have to find it.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.899
- [Bruce] Settle down,
the weekly meeting

11:41.968 --> 11:44.635
of Doggy Daycare
has come to order!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.904
- [Mutt] Hey Bruce,
I know I'm new here,

11:46.973 --> 11:48.973
but where's Sonny?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.942
- [Bruce] Don't worry
about Sonny, New Guy!

11:51.010 --> 11:52.443
- [Mutt] Shouldn't he be here?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.245
I mean, won't he get upset?

11:54.313 --> 11:56.214
- [Bruce] He left me
in charge, all right?

11:56.282 --> 11:59.217
- [Heft] In charge
of what, exactly?

11:59.285 --> 12:01.685
- [Bruce] In charge
of you lot, Missy!

12:01.755 --> 12:04.455
- [Heft] Don't you take
that tone with me, Mister!

12:04.523 --> 12:06.423
I won't stand for it.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.926
- [Bruce] Sorry, Heft, but
Sonny left me in charge.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.928
- [Heft] Well, Mr. Big Britches,

12:10.997 --> 12:13.037
I don't have to sit
here and listen to this!

12:13.099 --> 12:14.531
- [Bruce] Don't
make me chase you

12:14.600 --> 12:16.567
all around the daycare, Heft.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.869
- [Chunk] The only
thing he's chasing

12:17.937 --> 12:19.737
is his tail, mang, hehe!

12:19.806 --> 12:22.273
- [Bruce] What, I
never chase my tail!

12:22.341 --> 12:24.541
- [Chunk] Only because you
can't catch it, hehehe!

12:24.610 --> 12:26.377
- [Bruce] Chunk,
that's just not fair!

12:26.445 --> 12:29.180
Sonny really did
leave me in charge!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.089
- [Chunk] You know, I
think I see your brother,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.197
Sonny, coming this way!

12:32.752 --> 12:34.585
- [Bruce] What?
- [Chunk] Haha, fooled you!

12:34.654 --> 12:37.021
- [Bruce] Very funny! Haha!

12:37.090 --> 12:39.290
Look, I'm suppose
to be introducing

12:39.358 --> 12:41.259
the new guy here!

12:41.327 --> 12:43.995
- [Heft] (giggles)
Cute little morsel.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.731
- [Guts] A morsel of
chicken, a morsel of beef,

12:47.801 --> 12:50.868
a morsel of ham,
a morsel of bacon,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.937
oh, a squirrel!

12:53.006 --> 12:55.306
- [Bruce] Guts, would
you pay attention?

12:55.374 --> 12:57.341
Geesh, you're killing me!

12:57.410 --> 12:59.877
- [Heft] What's
your name, Cutie?

12:59.946 --> 13:04.148
- [Mutt] Uhh, the name's,
Mutt, Hi there, everybody.

13:04.217 --> 13:08.019
- [Bruce] Yeah, so,
this is Mutt, everybody.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.720
He's part of our family now,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.156
so, make him feel right at home.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.145
- [Heft] Well, sweetie,
nice to meet you,

13:14.160 --> 13:17.195
but I've got a massage
appointment, toodle loo!

13:17.263 --> 13:18.896
- [Guts] Wait for me, Michelle!

13:18.965 --> 13:20.731
Do you have treats?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.734
(soft piano music)

13:44.457 --> 13:47.691
Oh, treats are in here!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.894
- [Michelle] I know
it's in here somewhere!

13:49.963 --> 13:52.029
- [Guts] Oh boy, yummy treats!

13:52.098 --> 13:53.564
I wonder what kind!

13:53.632 --> 13:56.834
Biscuits, bones,
chews, Scooby Snacks.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.670
What's that?

13:59.739 --> 14:02.773
All this thinking of
food is making me sleepy!

14:02.842 --> 14:07.745
(yawn) and hungry,
think I'll take a nap!

14:07.813 --> 14:10.614
(soft mysterious music)

14:33.306 --> 14:35.606
- [Sonny] What's she
doing in our pool?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.175
Hey lady, what's the big idea?

14:38.244 --> 14:40.244
- [Bruce] Haha,
you tell her Sonny!

14:40.313 --> 14:42.246
- [Sonny] Bruce, grab the net!

14:42.315 --> 14:44.916
- [Bruce] Yeah, okay.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.418
- [Sonny] Good work, Brucey!

14:47.486 --> 14:49.366
- [Bruce] Haha,
Jackpot, our pool.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.288
- [Pool girl] I
hate all these dogs!

14:50.356 --> 14:51.088
Get all these dogs away from me,

14:51.157 --> 14:53.190
they're gonna bite me.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.094
- [Guts] Hey guys, you
better get out of there,

14:57.163 --> 14:59.997
or we're going to
get in trouble again!

15:00.066 --> 15:02.166
- [Chunk] Hey, I
smell treats, yo!

15:02.235 --> 15:05.903
I've got a nose like a
Bloodhound, who's in?

15:05.972 --> 15:08.672
- [Guts] Chunk says
he can smell treats!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.207
We should go check it out!

15:10.276 --> 15:11.475
- [Heft] Never mind that!

15:11.544 --> 15:13.877
I see something much
bigger than a treat!

15:13.947 --> 15:17.448
- [Guts] Really, where
is it, over there?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.650
- [Heft] Follow me, kid!

15:19.718 --> 15:20.851
(phone ringing)

15:20.920 --> 15:22.954
- Hello.
- Ameilia!

15:23.022 --> 15:24.422
It's Doctor Levi, we
have an emergency,

15:24.490 --> 15:27.091
I need your help!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.226
- [Bully ♪1] That dog
from the dumpster?

15:29.295 --> 15:31.195
- [Girl's Dog] I am not
from the dumpster, Sir!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.730
- Better get out of here
loser, or we're gonna soak ya.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.899
- Hope you brought your
bathing suit, haha!

15:35.969 --> 15:38.069
- Why are you making
fun of me and my dog?

15:38.137 --> 15:40.604
- [Bully ♪1] Hit it!

15:40.673 --> 15:42.806
- [Girl] Stop, stop!

15:42.875 --> 15:44.408
- [Girl's Dog] I'm all wet!

15:44.477 --> 15:45.742
- What are you guys doing?
- [Bully ♪1 & ♪2] Nothing.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.212
- [Mutt] They're just
mean bullies, Ameilia.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.481
- Are you being bullies?
- [Bully ♪1 & ♪2] No.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.016
- That's what it looks like.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.150
- Are you guys okay?

15:53.219 --> 15:54.918
- [Girl's Dog] They
got me all wet!

15:54.988 --> 15:56.920
- [Mutt] You'll love it
at Waggz and Whiskerz!

15:56.990 --> 15:59.790
- [Girl's Dog] It sounds
like a great place!

16:10.669 --> 16:13.570
- [Mutt] Hi Dr. Levi.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.641
Ooo, cold hands!

16:17.710 --> 16:18.709
- [Dr. Levi] You're
doing well, Meils,

16:18.777 --> 16:20.277
your parents would be proud.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.778
All this work you're
doing to help,

16:21.847 --> 16:25.682
even the whole missing pet
thing, it just amazes me.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.151
- [Ameilia] Maybe, I
don't know if Michelle

16:27.220 --> 16:29.253
will ever truly
forgive me, though.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.023
- You know she loves you,
she shares your spirit!

16:32.091 --> 16:33.991
(cell phone ringing)

16:35.928 --> 16:37.794
- Hey love, what's up?

16:37.863 --> 16:41.865
No school today, are you sure?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.834
Okay, I'll swing by on
the way to Doggy Daycare,

16:43.903 --> 16:48.139
and pick the two of you
up, love you, too, honey.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.507
- [Ameilia] Ruby?

16:49.575 --> 16:51.608
- [Dr. Levi] She's having
a harder day today.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.378
Not conducive her
being in school.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.013
- Well, it's time
to take him out.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.183
You know he's a street
dog, he has to be set free!

16:59.252 --> 17:00.584
- [Dr. Levi] I hear you.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.552
- [Ameilia] Thanks, Dr. Levi.
- [Dr. Levi] Anytime.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.754
- [Mutt] Bye Dr. Levi!

17:11.364 --> 17:13.431
- [Bone] Well boys, smells to me

17:13.499 --> 17:15.732
like company's coming.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.174
- [Chloey] Ya mon,
me smell that too.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.009
Me be thinking that
Mutt be comin' mon!

17:26.079 --> 17:29.380
- [JT] I smell it too, Bone.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.649
It's Mutt all right,
I know his scent.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.486
(jazz music)

17:52.305 --> 17:55.172
- [Bone] So, you wanna
join the Bone Gang?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.941
- [Mutt] Sounds like fun,
what do I have to do?

17:58.010 --> 18:00.944
- [Bone] Time for
the initiation!

18:01.013 --> 18:04.115
- [Tank] Oy, I don't
trust him, Bone.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.050
- [Chloey] Oh, mon, me don't
trust him neither, boss!

18:07.120 --> 18:09.120
Me think he got the shifty eyes.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.556
- [Granite] Awww, look at
him, he's a cute little fella.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.858
- [JT] He smells
like a rat to me!

18:14.927 --> 18:17.894
- [Bone] Enough, it's decided.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.863
- [Mutt] What's the initiation?

18:19.932 --> 18:23.134
- [Bone] It's real simple, Mutt.

18:23.202 --> 18:27.371
- [Granite] All you gotta
do, is chase the mailman!

18:27.440 --> 18:29.306
- [JT] Just like Bone did,

18:29.375 --> 18:32.143
way back when he
started the gang.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.379
- [Granite] It's the only
way to know for sure.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.615
- [Mutt] Uhh, I
don't understand.

18:37.683 --> 18:41.051
The only way to know
what for sure, Granite?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.319
- [Bone] The only way to know

18:42.388 --> 18:44.921
if you're loyal to the gang.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.359
Now, go chase the mailman.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.328
- [Mutt] Okay, I
think I can do that.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.466
- [Bone] Yeah, the
mailman (drools)

18:55.535 --> 18:57.901
I'll be right behind ya!

19:04.343 --> 19:06.076
Over here, fellas!

19:06.145 --> 19:09.146
- [Granite] D'uh, coming, Bone!

19:10.149 --> 19:11.582
- [Mutt] What's the plan?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.417
- [Bone] Tomorrow,
when the mailman shows,

19:13.486 --> 19:15.319
you chase him, got it?

19:15.388 --> 19:18.789
- [Mutt] Got it, I
think, what's that?

19:18.857 --> 19:22.426
- [Female Dog] Help me,
help me, I've been stolen!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.597
- Basically, if things don't
change for the better soon,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.566
then we're going
to lose the place

19:28.634 --> 19:29.900
- [LL] What if you
guys sell this place,

19:29.968 --> 19:31.669
and move into a smaller one?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.103
- The problem is that the bank

19:33.172 --> 19:35.206
basically owns most of it.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.040
We can probably afford
to get a small unit,

19:37.109 --> 19:38.041
but it's probably
not going to be

19:38.110 --> 19:40.344
big enough for the dogs.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.845
- I don't have much
money left after

19:41.914 --> 19:43.046
Ruby's medical bills,

19:43.115 --> 19:45.048
but I could take on
some of your dogs

19:45.117 --> 19:46.483
if worse comes to worse.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.719
- Same here, I can
take some of them,

19:48.787 --> 19:50.354
anything to do to help out,

19:50.423 --> 19:53.090
I mean, they're such
beautiful creatures.

19:53.158 --> 19:54.791
- Thanks, honestly,
I don't know what

19:54.860 --> 19:58.028
I would do without you,
and Michelle's really upset

19:58.097 --> 20:00.997
because our parent's
aren't here.

20:02.901 --> 20:06.270
Thanks, I have to
save the place.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.341
- [Michelle] I
can't even imagine

20:10.409 --> 20:13.410
what he's doing to
these poor creatures!

20:13.479 --> 20:14.759
- [Chunk] I find that Dognapper,

20:14.813 --> 20:16.913
I bite him right
on the butt, yo!

20:16.982 --> 20:19.717
- [Heft] He's a
very, very bad man!

20:19.785 --> 20:21.385
- [Guts] I wonder
what's for dinner!

20:21.454 --> 20:23.820
- [Strobel] We find him
and we make him talk!

20:23.889 --> 20:25.889
- [Mutt] I think I
saw the kidnapper.

20:25.924 --> 20:29.360
I bet I could follow his
tracks right to his hideout!

20:29.428 --> 20:32.296
- [Champ] Then what
are we waiting for?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.766
- [Mutt] His name
is Bone, and-and,

20:35.834 --> 20:37.434
they seem like really nice dogs,

20:37.503 --> 20:39.403
and they invited me
to join their gang!

20:39.472 --> 20:41.905
All I have to do is
chase the mailman!

20:41.974 --> 20:45.376
- [Strobel] Nein, nein,
nein, these are bad dogs,

20:45.444 --> 20:47.611
unt I would not trust them!

20:47.680 --> 20:50.147
- [Mutt] But they're great
dogs, you just don't know!

20:50.215 --> 20:51.482
- [France] Don't do it!

20:51.550 --> 20:53.517
You want to stay
at Doggy Daycare.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.052
You'll be nothing but
trouble, trouble, trouble.

20:56.121 --> 20:59.055
- [Strobel] You do not
understand the situation!

20:59.124 --> 21:01.258
They are just using you!

21:02.528 --> 21:04.695
- [France] I'm out of here,
that's it, I'm finished.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.731
I'm not gonna be
any part of this.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.100
- [Mutt] But they look
out for one another.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.635
- [Strobel] France is right.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.971
There is no good that can
come of this association.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.573
- [Mutt] Aww, but
you don't know what

21:16.642 --> 21:18.609
you're talking about, Strobel.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.345
- [Strobel] Auf
wiedersehen, mein Herr.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.415
- [Mutt] Fine, I'm gonna
go join them, anyway!

21:25.984 --> 21:28.151
(jazz music)

21:32.825 --> 21:36.293
- [Bone] What's
your decision, Mutt?

21:36.362 --> 21:37.402
- [Mutt] I'll do it!

21:38.297 --> 21:41.765
I'll chase the mailman
and join the gang!

21:41.834 --> 21:46.002
- [Bone] Then let's go
get him, time's awastin'

21:48.073 --> 21:50.641
- [Mutt] Okay, coming!

21:52.445 --> 21:56.246
(quirky music)

21:59.418 --> 22:00.784
- [Mutt] There he is.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.186
- [Bone] Now wait till
he gets a little closer.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.558
- [Mutt] Aww, I don't know.

22:07.626 --> 22:08.692
- [Bone] You ready?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.160
- [Mutt] This
doesn't seem right.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.628
- [Bone] Move, go!

22:11.697 --> 22:13.263
- [Mutt] I don't think
I can do this, Bone.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.198
- [Bone] What?
- [Mutt] No, I'm going to go.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.001
- [Bone] What, where
you goin' get back here!

22:18.070 --> 22:20.170
Guess it's all up to me.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.773
Yeah, let's go, postman!

22:22.842 --> 22:24.908
I'll never forgive you for this.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.878
Nobody will ever
trust you again, Mutt.

22:27.946 --> 22:30.414
- [Nappy] Hey, that
looks like Mutt.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.782
How you doing Mutt?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.751
- [Mutt] Have you seen Sonny?

22:33.819 --> 22:34.918
- [Nappy] What's going on?

22:34.987 --> 22:37.153
- [Mutt] I've made
a terrible mistake.

22:37.222 --> 22:38.622
Have you seen Sonny?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.758
- [Bruce] Inside, what
did you do, bite somebody?

22:40.826 --> 22:42.292
- [Nappy] Whoa.
- [Mutt] What, no.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.461
- [Bruce] Hey Sonny,
Mutt needs to see you.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.229
I think he bit somebody.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.698
- [Mutt] I didn't bite anyone.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.400
- [Sonny] I know
what ya done, kid.

22:49.468 --> 22:53.103
It's okay, follow me,
I'll take care of it.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.980
- [Mutt] Do you
know Bone, Sonny?

22:57.009 --> 23:00.444
- [Sonny] Yeah, Bones
and I go way back.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.849
- [Bone] Hello, Sonny.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.051
Kind of expected
to see you here.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.154
Didn't think you'd bring
this traitor with you.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.089
- [Mutt] I'm not a traitor.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.278
- [Bone] Did he tell you

23:14.326 --> 23:16.693
he skipped out on
his initiation?

23:16.762 --> 23:19.262
- [Granite] Yeah,
like a little puppy.

23:19.331 --> 23:22.866
- [JT] Like a cute
little puppy, teeheehee.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.468
- [Mutt] But it's just
not right to chase

23:24.537 --> 23:26.417
after people and
try to hurt them.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.572
- [Cassey] Ohhhh,
that makes me so mad!

23:28.641 --> 23:30.774
What about us dogs?

23:30.843 --> 23:34.377
Bones looks after us,
people abandoned us.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.846
- [Bruce] Yeah, like,
there's good people,

23:35.915 --> 23:37.448
and there's bad
people, you know,

23:37.516 --> 23:40.484
like, what's that, a squirrel?

23:40.553 --> 23:43.854
We gotta all stick
together, people and humans.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.656
That way we can
help one another.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.591
- [Cassey] I'd rather
trust my own kind,

23:47.660 --> 23:50.727
thank you very much,
you big puppy, you!

23:50.796 --> 23:52.863
- [Mutt] Instead of
calling each other names,

23:52.932 --> 23:54.030
we should work together

23:54.099 --> 23:56.299
to help stop that dog kidnapper.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.535
- [Tank] Bone, do not
trust the little one,

23:58.604 --> 24:01.304
he has no honor, he'll run away!

24:01.373 --> 24:02.940
- [Sonny] Who hasn't
made a few mistakes

24:03.008 --> 24:04.407
in their life, eh Bones?

24:04.477 --> 24:05.809
But Mutt and Bruce are right,

24:05.878 --> 24:07.010
we gotta work together

24:07.079 --> 24:09.079
if we're gonna stop
this dog napper.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.914
- [Bone] Join with us, Sonny.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.950
It'll be just like the old days.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.785
- [Mutt] If you won't help
catch this dog napper,

24:14.854 --> 24:17.320
then I'll just have to
do it all on my own!

24:17.389 --> 24:21.224
- [Bone] Run, Mutt,
that's what you do best!

24:24.897 --> 24:25.996
- [Sonny] C'mon Brucey,

24:26.064 --> 24:28.331
we gotta keep an eye on Mutt.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.233
- [Mutt] Hey, I'm
right here fellas.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.437
You ran right
overtop of me, geesh!

24:34.507 --> 24:36.206
- [Sonny] You did
good today, Bruce.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.374
- [Bruce] Really?

24:37.442 --> 24:39.476
- [Sonny] I was,
uh, proud of you.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.311
- [Bruce] Aww jeez,
Sonny, thanks so much,

24:41.380 --> 24:42.613
you know, I was thinking...

24:42.681 --> 24:45.949
- [Sonny] Shut it, fleabag!
- [Bruce] Okay.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.621
- [Mutt] Hey guys, wait for me!

24:58.664 --> 25:01.665
♪ We're down in Doggy Daycare

25:01.734 --> 25:04.801
♪ Come to us when
life is rough

25:14.947 --> 25:16.479
- [Sonny] Hey pal, back off!

25:16.549 --> 25:18.015
- [Bruce] Aww, what

25:18.083 --> 25:20.043

25:20.085 --> 25:22.052
Hey, hey, don't come any closer!

25:22.120 --> 25:24.320
- [Bruce] I don't like
the look of this guy!

25:24.389 --> 25:25.722
What do we do?

25:25.791 --> 25:28.224

you don't wanna mess with me!

25:37.169 --> 25:39.069
- [Mutt] Hey, that's
the kidnapper!

25:39.137 --> 25:41.057
- [Bruce] Sonny, this
is the kidnapper!

25:41.073 --> 25:42.505
- [Sonny] This is the guy!

25:42.575 --> 25:44.041
- [Mutt] He's getting away!

25:44.109 --> 25:46.076
- [Sonny] Follow me, I think
I know where he's going.

25:46.144 --> 25:49.245
- [Bruce] Come on, Mutt,
let's follow Sonny!

25:49.314 --> 25:51.381
(jazz music)

26:25.651 --> 26:28.051
- [Sarah] Oh no, no, no,
no, where is he taking me?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.186
Oh no, no, no, no,
no, no, please.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.323
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.558
Oh no, what's in here?

26:35.628 --> 26:39.429
It's so dark, it's
so dark, oh gosh!

26:39.498 --> 26:41.331
- [Bruce] Come on fellas!

26:41.399 --> 26:42.633
- [Sonny] There's his car!

26:42.701 --> 26:44.668
- [Bruce] Oh, we're
gonna get you!

26:44.737 --> 26:46.903
- [Mutt] I'm picking up
the scent of a lot of dogs!

26:46.972 --> 26:49.172
- [Bruce] This must be
his hideout, eh Sonny?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.975
- [Sonny] Yeah, you're a
regular Sherlock Holmes.

26:52.044 --> 26:55.712
So Mutt, what's the
plan, what do we do?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.981
- [Bruce] I'm going to
tap into my inner ninja!

26:58.050 --> 27:00.283
- [Sonny] Oh brother!
- [Bruce] What?

27:00.352 --> 27:01.918
- [Mutt] We wait
for him to come out,

27:01.987 --> 27:03.386
then we jump him!

27:03.455 --> 27:06.823
- [Sonny] Okay, we'll
back your play, Mutt.

27:06.892 --> 27:10.160
- See, this is what happens

27:10.228 --> 27:11.461
when your parent's
don't think you're

27:11.530 --> 27:15.065
responsible enough
to have a dog.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.768
This is what happens

27:17.836 --> 27:20.170
when you ask for a
dog for Christmas,

27:20.238 --> 27:24.307
but they give you a
can of paint instead.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.779
Well, I'd say I have
a dog now, winning!

27:30.716 --> 27:32.816
(dog barking)

27:38.991 --> 27:41.424
(gasp) You guys again?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.827
Hahaha, talk about
making my job easy!

27:43.896 --> 27:47.463
- [Mutt] Sonny, distract
him, Bruce, get behind him!

27:50.102 --> 27:52.569
- [Sonny] Now, get him
boy, get him, Mutt.

27:52.637 --> 27:55.172
- [Bruce] Haha!
- [Mutt] I got him, I got him!

27:55.240 --> 27:56.606
- [Sonny] Hang on, Mutt!

27:56.675 --> 28:00.077
- [Bruce] Atta boy, Mutt,
use the ninja technique.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.212
- [Mutt] I can't
hold him much longer!

28:02.280 --> 28:05.148
- [Sonny] Hang on
buddy, Brucey, come on!

28:05.217 --> 28:07.984
- [Sarah] Can you
help me, please!

28:08.053 --> 28:11.254
- [Mutt] Sorry fellas, I
just couldn't hold him!

28:11.323 --> 28:12.443
- [Bruce] He's getting away!

28:12.457 --> 28:13.190
- [Sonny] Hey, get back here,

28:13.258 --> 28:14.758
we're not done with you!

28:14.827 --> 28:17.060
(fast cheerful music)

28:35.480 --> 28:38.381
- [Bruce] He got away,
Sonny he got away!

28:38.450 --> 28:39.783
- [Sonny] How far do
you think he can go,

28:39.852 --> 28:42.119
you melonhead!

28:46.658 --> 28:48.759
- [Michelle] "Michelle,
please feed dogs:

28:48.827 --> 28:50.627
"Bruce, Sonny, and Mutt."

28:50.695 --> 28:51.762
- [Ameilia] Good morning!

28:51.830 --> 28:54.965
- Hey! Big day today, huh?

28:55.033 --> 28:56.733
- You can say that again.

28:56.802 --> 28:58.762
Tomorrow's gonna be
even a bigger day.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.470
(sigh) We still have to
save the place, right.

29:00.538 --> 29:03.740
- [Mutt] Don't worry Michelle,
we'll save the place!

29:03.809 --> 29:05.009
- Now where's Sonny and Bruce?

29:05.010 --> 29:06.910
I have to go find them.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.444
- [Pet Napper] "Dodgy Daycare,"

29:08.513 --> 29:11.014
pff, what a stupid name!

29:11.083 --> 29:13.516
Oh, wait a minute!

29:13.585 --> 29:18.822
"do-ggy daycare, doggy daycare!"

29:18.891 --> 29:21.724
Wow, that's a much better name,

29:21.794 --> 29:25.528
'cause I love me
some dogs, okay!

29:33.672 --> 29:36.372
Closed is for suckers.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.980
Yeah, hmm.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.059
Let's use our
brains a little bit.

30:06.138 --> 30:10.606
Ugh, that's not going
to work, Plan "D."

30:34.733 --> 30:37.133
Doggy Daycare!

30:38.570 --> 30:40.503
(dog barking)

30:56.521 --> 30:58.288
(doorbell ringing)

31:04.796 --> 31:07.397
Hello, I was inquiring about

31:07.465 --> 31:10.566
your lovely establishment
Doggy Daycare.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.103
- [Ameilia] Huh,
is this your dog?

31:13.171 --> 31:16.006
- Yeah, yeah we go way
back, this is mine.

31:16.074 --> 31:18.241
- [Ameilia] Really?
- Yeah.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.910
- [Ameilia] Where
did you find her?

31:19.978 --> 31:23.479
- Oh, umm, ahh,

31:23.548 --> 31:26.116
in a farm, yeah, a farm.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.050
- [Ameilia] I'm calling 911!

31:27.119 --> 31:27.984
- No, no, no!

31:28.053 --> 31:29.019
- [Ameilia] Get off my property!

31:29.087 --> 31:30.353
- [Mutt] There he goes!

31:30.422 --> 31:31.888
- [Sonny] After him boys!
- [Bruce] Hee hee!

31:31.957 --> 31:34.224
(fast piano music)

31:48.740 --> 31:50.473
- [Bruce] Aww, he
got away again!

31:50.542 --> 31:53.476
- [Sonny] Yeah, but we's
knows where he's going.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.046
- [Mutt] Let's go!

32:01.886 --> 32:02.852
- [Ameilia] Yeah,
he's headed down

32:02.921 --> 32:04.787
Otis Avenue past Rocket Lane.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.776
- [LL] Just keep
on his tail, okay?

32:06.791 --> 32:08.091
- [Ameilia] And don't
forget your camera,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.827
and I already called
the cops, k, bye!

32:39.858 --> 32:43.059
- [Police] Hey!

32:58.243 --> 32:59.609
- [LL] You're
witnessing first hand,

32:59.677 --> 33:01.378
how much help
animals really need.

33:01.446 --> 33:02.812
- I'm in shock, I can't believe

33:02.881 --> 33:04.914
we're actually saving them!

33:04.983 --> 33:05.882
- [LL] And all the bad things

33:05.950 --> 33:08.651
that happens behind the scenes.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.454
Lucky for them, the
Doggy Daycare champions

33:11.523 --> 33:14.957
were on the case,
anything you want to say?

33:15.027 --> 33:17.394
- Sure, unlicensed
dog breeding kennels

33:17.462 --> 33:19.129
like these are all
over the country.

33:19.197 --> 33:20.397
They cage and they breed dogs,

33:20.465 --> 33:22.132
and they sell them to
different pet shops.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.733
So, if you're interested
in getting a dog

33:23.801 --> 33:25.502
I suggest that you
go to the shelter,

33:25.570 --> 33:26.869
or maybe a pound,

33:26.938 --> 33:28.338
because a lot of the stores
are getting their dogs

33:28.407 --> 33:29.272
from places like these,

33:29.341 --> 33:31.941
and we aren't even aware of it.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.011
Ahh, it's so cute, so small!

33:41.586 --> 33:44.754
Where's the champion of today?

33:45.924 --> 33:48.358
Thanks to this guy,
he saved the day!

33:48.427 --> 33:52.695
- [Mutt] Shucks,
Ameilia, it was nothing!

33:52.764 --> 33:55.798
- This is for you mom and dad!

33:55.867 --> 33:58.668
(victorious music)

34:06.644 --> 34:08.511
- [Mutt] I'm so glad we
were able to save you

34:08.580 --> 34:11.047
from that kidnapper, Sarah!

34:11.116 --> 34:13.649
- [Sarah] Thanks
for rescuing me!

34:13.717 --> 34:16.851
- [Mutt] You're so pretty!
- [Sarah] Thank you.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.589
Gosh, what do I
do, fine, I'll go.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.231
(romantic piano music)

35:14.012 --> 35:18.248
- [Mutt] I love spending
time with you, Sarah.

35:18.316 --> 35:21.984
- [Sarah] Me too.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.521
Oh, I don't know what to say.

35:24.589 --> 35:28.358
- [Mutt] I would love to
grow old with you, Sarah.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.995
You look just as beautiful,

35:33.064 --> 35:36.065
today, as the day we met.

35:38.803 --> 35:42.938
- [Sarah] Oh, you're
just as romantic!

35:43.007 --> 35:46.042
(soft frolicky music)

36:06.764 --> 36:08.964
- [Mutt] Wow, you live here?

36:09.033 --> 36:11.067
I didn't know you were rich.

36:11.135 --> 36:15.405
- [Sarah] Yup, this is my place!

36:15.473 --> 36:17.840
- [Mutt] I love
Michelle and Ameilia.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.943
They take such great care of us.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.381
- [Sarah] So do I. (giggle)

36:27.652 --> 36:30.420
You're so cute.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.821
- [Mutt] Waggz and
Whiskerz takes care

36:31.889 --> 36:34.691
of a lot of dogs, just like me,

36:34.759 --> 36:36.599
but since Michelle's
parent's died,

36:36.628 --> 36:39.095
they've had a hard
time financially.

36:39.163 --> 36:42.031
Oh, I'd hate to lose my home.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.134
Do you think your
people could help?

36:45.203 --> 36:47.043
- [Sarah] Okay,
whatever you say!

36:47.071 --> 36:49.606
- [Mutt] Oh that
would be terrific!

36:49.674 --> 36:52.609
I can't wait to tell Michelle!

37:00.385 --> 37:03.886
Sarah is so pretty,
and such soft fur,

37:07.091 --> 37:09.559
And she said her people
can help the Doggy Daycare!

37:09.628 --> 37:11.361
- [Kahlua] Haha, atta boy, Mutt!

37:11.429 --> 37:14.264
- [Chunk] Oh, sounds
like you got it bad, ese!

37:14.332 --> 37:15.498
- [Strobel] Vunderbar, Mutt!

37:15.567 --> 37:17.833
Congratulations, we
are so happy for you!

37:17.902 --> 37:21.537
- [Mutt] Thanks fellas,
Sarah's terrific,

37:21.606 --> 37:23.506
and I just hope that
her people can help

37:23.575 --> 37:26.242
the Doggy Daycare.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.164
- [LL] Yeah, well,
if you hear anything,

37:48.232 --> 37:50.767
give us a call, perfect.

37:52.136 --> 37:53.603
- [Dr. Levi] Hey, pup.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.805
- [Michelle] This is a new
dog for the Doggy Daycare.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.540
- She looks a bit nervous.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.643
- I was reading about
unlicensed dog kennels,

38:00.712 --> 38:02.945
and they said that pet shops

38:03.014 --> 38:04.980
are the biggest buyers yet.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.148
- I bet most of
them don't even know

38:06.217 --> 38:07.950
where their dogs
are coming from.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.018
There needs to be a lot more

38:09.086 --> 38:10.720
awareness of that problem.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.522
- I agree.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.823
- [LL] Okay, yeah,
no we need to strike

38:13.891 --> 38:16.726
while the iron is hot, okay.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.964
Awesome, so this is
the plan, ladies.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.265
We're gonna get you guys

38:23.335 --> 38:24.734
telling us some funny stories,

38:24.803 --> 38:26.836
some heart-warming
stories about the dogs,

38:26.904 --> 38:28.003
and then I'm gonna set up

38:28.072 --> 38:29.405
a bunch of cameras
around the yard,

38:29.474 --> 38:31.307
just to get a bunch of
footage of them, you know,

38:31.376 --> 38:33.543
running around and playing.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.211
- You're going to film the dogs?

38:35.279 --> 38:36.879
- Well, yeah, that's
right, Miss Bright.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.215
- Ahh!

38:39.283 --> 38:40.450
You know, and then
later we're gonna

38:40.518 --> 38:42.719
dub some voices, a
storyline overtop of it,

38:42.787 --> 38:44.721
you know, give them each
their own personality.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.389
It's gonna be great!

38:46.458 --> 38:47.857
- I'm going to be on TV?

38:47.925 --> 38:51.394
- Yes you are, and you're
going to shine beautiful.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.895
How you guys doing,
you having fun?

38:52.964 --> 38:54.731
- [Michelle] Yeah.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.131
- It's a really nice day,

38:56.200 --> 38:57.433
why don't you guys go
outside and have some fun?

38:57.502 --> 39:00.803
- [Michelle & Ruby] Okay.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.573
- Doggy Daycare's
gonna be so famous!

39:03.641 --> 39:06.743
- We'll see, do you think

39:06.811 --> 39:09.912
people would like to
see Doggy Theatre,

39:09.981 --> 39:14.250
or Doggy Stand up Comedy?

39:14.318 --> 39:17.920
Hah, or maybe a Doggy Dance act!

39:17.989 --> 39:21.123
- [Champ] Not to worry girls,
I've got this all handled.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.792
You see, I'm a triple threat:

39:22.861 --> 39:25.628
I can sing, dance and look good.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.063
- [Strobel] Champ, you
are so full of kibble.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.699
Of course, the only
dog who should be

39:29.768 --> 39:32.101
on the television should be me.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.537
Just listen to my
adorable accent.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.038
- [Bruce] Ah,
you's guys are both

39:36.107 --> 39:37.740
a couple of melonheads.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.142
Why would I wanna see your
mugs' on the television?

39:40.211 --> 39:48.211
Look at me, I should
be there, I got class!

39:52.056 --> 39:55.057
- [LL] Perfect, so, you
know, just naturally,

39:55.126 --> 39:58.127
I guess, just tell me a story.

39:58.195 --> 40:01.196
- Well about a year ago.

40:01.265 --> 40:05.501
(farting noise)

40:05.570 --> 40:13.570
- I think I pooped my pants!

40:13.812 --> 40:16.546
- [Bruce] Whew,
no more wet food!

40:16.614 --> 40:18.314
- [Ameilia] Haha, the
look on Bruce's face.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.649
I swear it looked
like he was trying

40:19.717 --> 40:23.486
to cover for Pop or something.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.656
- Sonny is very
protective of our family,

40:26.724 --> 40:28.458
there was this one time.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.125
- [Bully ♪3] That is the
most disgusting thing

40:30.194 --> 40:32.628
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.263
- [Bully ♪1] How
about you head home.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.832

40:38.169 --> 40:40.536

40:40.605 --> 40:42.672
Your little friends

40:42.740 --> 40:48.010
did they tell you
it, do you see her?

40:48.079 --> 40:50.312
- [Sonny] Hey, you
guys should be nicer,

40:50.381 --> 40:52.047
what if somebody teased you?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.916
You wouldn't like it
much, now, would ya?

pathetic, useless and lonely.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.255
You should just leave.

do you have sisters?

41:02.861 --> 41:04.660
Do you have people
who respect you?

41:04.729 --> 41:10.165
Because the way you are
talking to me, is garbage.

41:13.070 --> 41:18.941
slash alley, and hang
out with other garbage.

- Its all good Meils,
it was a long time ago.

41:54.278 --> 41:56.712
They haven't said a
mean word since then.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.481

we got enough for today.

41:59.551 --> 42:07.551

42:30.615 --> 42:33.315

42:36.821 --> 42:38.888
If it's the last thing I do.

42:38.957 --> 42:41.891
You are a boil on the

Oh, you, ahh!

Run guys, it's the
Dogcatcher again!

43:16.527 --> 43:21.263
I can't let him catch me.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.933
Gotta hide.

You come back here you little.

43:27.371 --> 43:32.708
Oh no-no-no-no, ugh!

Oooh, there's Michelle's
puffer, she needs this!

43:41.819 --> 43:45.021
I'm coming, Michelle!

43:45.089 --> 43:53.089
I've got your medicine!

43:57.068 --> 43:59.334

43:59.403 --> 44:01.436
Hey, I'm gonna upload
this to YouTube.

44:01.505 --> 44:03.139
Maybe it'll help
save the daycare.

44:03.207 --> 44:04.874
- [Chunk] Mutt,
you're a hero, ese!

44:04.942 --> 44:06.742
- [Mutt] I'm not a hero!

44:06.811 --> 44:07.677
I was just trying to get away

44:07.745 --> 44:09.411
from that bad dogcatcher,

44:09.480 --> 44:11.013
and I saw Michelle's puffer,

44:11.082 --> 44:13.315
and I knew she needed it.

44:13.384 --> 44:21.384
- [LL] You saved the day,
you saved the day, right!

44:25.163 --> 44:27.429
- Chris, I've got
some bad news for you.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.297
- What bad news?

44:28.365 --> 44:29.498
- I got a phone call.

44:29.567 --> 44:31.701
This is the third time
this has happened.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.670
- Yeah, yeah, I
almost got that dog,

44:34.739 --> 44:36.105
you know the brown-

44:36.174 --> 44:39.175
- Chris, I'm not, No, Chris
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

44:39.243 --> 44:40.109
- [Dogcatcher] It's
that brown dog!

44:40.178 --> 44:41.610
- Chris, I don't care who it is,

44:41.679 --> 44:43.412
it's the third
time, you're done!

44:43.480 --> 44:45.547
You're finished
in this business.

44:45.616 --> 44:47.883
- No, dogcatching's
all I've ever known.

44:47.952 --> 44:50.485
Boss, I'm a dogcatcher.

44:50.554 --> 44:52.387
That dog, you're never
gonna get that dog!

44:52.456 --> 44:54.056
- Don't worry about
the dog, Chris!

44:54.125 --> 44:55.191
You've gotta worry
about yourself,

44:55.259 --> 44:56.491
and I've gotta
worry about myself.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.427
I can't jeopardize the business.

44:58.495 --> 45:01.330
- What am I going to do?

45:01.398 --> 45:03.099
- Well, you know what, Chris,

45:03.167 --> 45:04.734
you're going to have to
find another profession.

45:04.802 --> 45:08.104
That's it, I'm sorry, you're
fired, and I've had it, okay?

45:08.172 --> 45:11.140
Just come get your
paycheck, and that's it.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.408
- [LL] What are you doing
on this private property?

45:13.477 --> 45:15.244
Like, do you understand that
this is private property,

45:15.312 --> 45:16.812
and you can't be here?

45:16.881 --> 45:18.347
- I just lost my job.

45:18.415 --> 45:20.149
- [LL] Catching dogs?

45:20.218 --> 45:22.138
These dogs don't
need to be caught!

45:22.153 --> 45:24.186
- This is supposed to be
a safe place for dogs.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.355
- I've been a
dogcatcher all my life!

45:26.423 --> 45:28.824
- [Mutt] I don't want to be
caught by that Dogcatcher.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.659
Next time I'm going to make sure

45:30.728 --> 45:33.195
I can get under this fence.

45:33.264 --> 45:36.565
Let me see, if I can
just squeeze under.

45:36.634 --> 45:38.400
- These dogs are here

45:38.469 --> 45:39.534
because this is a
safe place to be.

45:39.603 --> 45:41.036
- Dogs are all my life!

45:41.105 --> 45:42.537
- What is going on here?

45:42.606 --> 45:44.974
- I lost my job.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.943
I can't catch dogs anymore.

45:48.012 --> 45:51.313
- [Mutt] I'm stuck, help me!

45:51.382 --> 45:52.882
- Well, you know, you wouldn't

45:52.950 --> 45:55.918
be too bad around here.

45:55.987 --> 45:58.453
- [Ameilia] Listen,
you lost your job.

45:58.522 --> 45:59.789
Instead of being a dogcatcher,

45:59.857 --> 46:01.223
do you want to help us out?

46:01.292 --> 46:02.925
We have a Doggy Daycare.

46:02.994 --> 46:03.859
- I get to stay with dogs?

46:03.928 --> 46:05.594
I get to work with dogs again?

46:05.663 --> 46:08.497
- [Mutt] Ow, it hurts,
I can't breathe.

46:08.565 --> 46:10.166
- What about tomorrow, at nine?

46:10.234 --> 46:12.354
- [Dogcatcher] Oh, thanks.
- [Ameilia] You're welcome.

46:12.403 --> 46:16.939
- This is great, I'm in.

46:17.008 --> 46:20.475
- [Mutt] Someone help me.

46:20.544 --> 46:25.414
- Hah, all right!
- [Ameilia] Bye.

46:25.482 --> 46:31.821
- [Mutt] Help!

46:31.889 --> 46:35.757
Oww, it hurts!

46:35.827 --> 46:39.128
- [Ameilia] Awww, he's so hurt.

46:39.197 --> 46:42.898
Oh God, he's hurt, I
don't want to hurt him.

46:42.967 --> 46:47.002
Let's bring him over here, okay?

46:47.071 --> 46:48.270
Aww, poor baby!

46:48.339 --> 46:52.274
- [Mutt] My chest
hurts, careful.

46:52.343 --> 46:55.911
- [LL] What happened,
is everything okay?

46:55.980 --> 46:57.679
Mutt, how you feeling?

46:57.748 --> 47:04.786
- It's okay boy,
help will come soon.

47:04.856 --> 47:06.521
- Dr. Levi!

47:06.590 --> 47:10.792
- [Michelle] Help, Mutt's hurt!

47:10.862 --> 47:12.361
- [Ameilia] Dr. Levi!

47:12.429 --> 47:14.997
- [Dr. Levi] Oh no, Mutt!

47:15.066 --> 47:17.632
Let me see.

47:17.701 --> 47:20.269
He's gonna need surgery.

47:20.338 --> 47:24.240
Could be broken
ribs, relax buddy.

47:24.308 --> 47:25.908
- He's gonna die 'cause of me?

47:25.977 --> 47:27.209
- No, that's not
going to happen.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.511
Dr. Levi, please do
anything you can, okay?

47:29.580 --> 47:37.580
- I'll do my best,
just relax, buddy.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
- [Mutt] Am I dying, Dr. Levi?

47:58.309 --> 48:00.009
- You'll be okay,
boy, don't you worry.

48:00.077 --> 48:01.911
I'll fix you up, I promise.

48:01.979 --> 48:06.115
- [Mutt] You promise?

48:06.183 --> 48:07.816
- [Sonny] After what
happened to our buddy Mutt,

48:07.885 --> 48:10.286
it got me thinking about
Bones and his gang.

48:10.354 --> 48:12.221
No dog should ever
have to be alone.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.323
They should have people
to look after them.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.058
Is anybody else coming?

48:16.127 --> 48:17.960
Brucey, did you tell
the rest of them?

48:18.029 --> 48:19.861
- [Bruce] Of course I
told everyone, Sonny.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.596
You told me to go
and tell everybody

48:21.665 --> 48:23.432
to come to this meeting
and I told them,

48:23.500 --> 48:25.301
at least I think I did.

48:25.369 --> 48:26.468
- [Morty] We should
go have a talk

48:26.537 --> 48:28.737
with this Bones
character and his gang.

48:28.806 --> 48:30.872
- [Chunk] They deserve
a second chance yo!

48:30.942 --> 48:32.341
- [Sonny] It's settled then.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.909
A small group of us will go off,

48:33.978 --> 48:41.978
and visit Bones and his gang.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.789
- [Bone] We've got
company coming, boys.

48:47.858 --> 48:51.961
Look sharp.

48:52.029 --> 48:54.129
It's the Doggy Daycare crew.

48:54.198 --> 48:56.065
- [Guts] Hey Bones,
don't know if you heard,

48:56.133 --> 48:57.366
but Mutt got hurt.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.969
- [Bone] What's that
got to do with me?

49:00.037 --> 49:02.204
Why should I care about Mutt,

49:02.273 --> 49:04.873
or any of the rest of
you for that matter.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.343
What's this really about, Sonny?

49:07.411 --> 49:09.111
- [Sonny] It got
us thinking, Bone.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.347
What if something were to
happen to one of you guys,

49:11.415 --> 49:13.375
there's nobody here
to look after you.

49:13.417 --> 49:15.517
- [Strobel] Yah, Mutt
was very fortunate,

49:15.586 --> 49:17.086
but what if one of
the little ones here

49:17.154 --> 49:20.089
got into an accident?

49:20.157 --> 49:22.992
Uppin' place my trust
in humans again?

49:23.060 --> 49:26.595
I don't think so, we look
after our own up here.

49:26.663 --> 49:28.663
- [Strobel] But wait a
minute, Bone, you must...

49:28.732 --> 49:30.966
- [Guts] That's Ameilia
calling us for dinner.

49:31.035 --> 49:38.107
- [Sonny] Go on, guys,
I'll be along, momentarily.

49:38.175 --> 49:41.776
Look, Bones, you know my story.

49:41.845 --> 49:43.645
Now I'm loved and cared for.

49:43.714 --> 49:45.447
You want in on some
of this action,

49:45.516 --> 49:47.916
you know where to find me.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.819
- [Bone] Lemme think about it.

49:50.888 --> 49:54.256
It's been a long time.

49:54.325 --> 49:58.827
(quirky music)

49:58.896 --> 50:01.663
- Your friend, Mutt,
is one crazy pup!

50:01.732 --> 50:07.569
Wait'll people see this!

50:07.638 --> 50:15.638
People are never
going to believe this!

50:18.949 --> 50:25.421
(snoring)

50:25.489 --> 50:28.590
- [Sonny] I'm just glad
Mutt's gonna be okay.

50:28.659 --> 50:30.259
He's a tough kid.

50:30.327 --> 50:31.993
- [Nappy] You think so Sonny?

50:32.063 --> 50:35.864
Hmm, well, yeah, I guess,

50:35.933 --> 50:43.933
he is kinda short, hmm, kinda
like holding up a mirror.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.242
- [Ameilia] Oh my gosh,
over 20,000 views!

50:47.311 --> 50:49.844
Ahh, so exciting!

50:49.913 --> 50:52.381
- Mom and Dad would
have been very happy.

50:52.450 --> 50:59.788
- Yeah, they would have been.

50:59.856 --> 51:07.856
- [Mutt] Sarah, hey,
Sarah, over here!

51:20.344 --> 51:24.313
Hi Sarah!
- [Sarah] Mutt! (giggles)

51:24.381 --> 51:27.382
- [Mutt] Oh, okay, we're
playing it cool, hehe.

51:27.451 --> 51:29.784
- We heard all about
what is happening

51:29.853 --> 51:33.188
with you and your dogs,
and everything you do here.

51:33.257 --> 51:34.789
- We think it's just amazing,

51:34.858 --> 51:36.758
and we're truly grateful
you saved our Sarah.

51:36.827 --> 51:38.667
- [Sarah] Yeah,
without Mutt, you know,

51:38.695 --> 51:43.332
where would I be, my
knight in shining armor.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.433
- We don't know what we would

51:44.502 --> 51:45.634
have done without her.

51:45.702 --> 51:48.137
My poor wife, she
was so miserable

51:48.205 --> 51:50.005
when she went missing.

51:50.073 --> 51:52.608
- We couldn't
sleep, couldn't eat.

51:52.676 --> 51:54.042
The weirdest and
horrible thoughts

51:54.111 --> 51:56.845
were running through my mind.

51:56.913 --> 51:58.813
- Well I'm sure
you love your dog

51:58.882 --> 52:00.782
just like how we
love all of our dogs.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.317
They're truly something special.

52:02.386 --> 52:04.219
- Definitely.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.787
- What we're here to
talk about, though,

52:05.856 --> 52:09.090
is helping you out with
your financial problems.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.627
- It's the least we could do,

52:11.695 --> 52:13.662
seeing as you saved our girl.

52:13.730 --> 52:16.265
- I don't know what
to say, I'm in shock.

52:16.333 --> 52:22.103
We're truly grateful from
the bottom of our hearts.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.505
- [Bruce] How you feeling, Mutt?

52:23.574 --> 52:26.141
- [Mutt] Let me show you.

52:26.210 --> 52:34.210
(cheerful music)

52:48.265 --> 52:56.071
- [Mutt] How's that Bruce?

52:56.139 --> 52:58.607
- [Bruce] I'm telling you,
Sonny, he don't look it,

52:58.676 --> 53:01.843
but that kid's tough,
he wore me out!

53:01.912 --> 53:09.912
- [Sonny] Ah, you're
just weak, ya melonhead.

53:15.759 --> 53:20.495
(phone ringing)

53:20.564 --> 53:26.602
- Hello, yes it is.

53:26.670 --> 53:28.637
That's wonderful news.

53:28.706 --> 53:31.873
- [Sonny] Hey Brucey, I
think this could be it!

53:31.942 --> 53:38.913
- Okay, thank you, talk to
you soon, have a great day.

53:38.982 --> 53:43.151
- Well, is it them?

53:43.220 --> 53:47.055
- Let's go for a walk.

53:47.124 --> 53:55.124
(chattering)

54:34.070 --> 54:36.037
- I don't understand,
they're not here,

54:36.106 --> 54:37.306
they said they're gonna be here,

54:37.374 --> 54:38.239
and they get our hopes up and...

54:38.309 --> 54:40.442
- Hey all!
- Oh, Hi!

54:40.511 --> 54:42.277
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

54:42.346 --> 54:43.712
You weren't stressing were you?

54:43.781 --> 54:45.480
- No, not at all (nervously)

54:45.549 --> 54:46.748
- How are you all today?

54:46.817 --> 54:48.417
- We're good, thanks for
asking, and yourselves?

54:48.485 --> 54:50.285
- Very good, very good.

54:50.354 --> 54:52.688
I see Mutt and Sarah are
getting along smashingly.

54:52.756 --> 54:54.823
- [Mutt] We're in love!

54:54.891 --> 54:56.057
- (giggles) Yes, they are.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.892
- Oh, young love,
how grand it is!

54:57.961 --> 54:59.728
- [Ameilia] (laughs)

54:59.797 --> 55:01.062
- Oh, and we have a
little extra something

55:01.131 --> 55:05.300
for you and Doggy Daycare.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.702
- [Ameilia] I can't.

55:06.770 --> 55:10.639
- [Sonny] Of course you
can, Kibble ain't cheap!

55:10.708 --> 55:12.507
- Nonsense, my dear,
don't even bother

55:12.576 --> 55:14.776
arguing about it.

55:14.845 --> 55:16.010
We've made up our minds,

55:16.079 --> 55:16.878
and we can't think
of anything better

55:16.947 --> 55:18.980
to spend our money on.

55:19.049 --> 55:24.319
- [Bruce] Hey, Sonny...

55:24.388 --> 55:27.522
- [Ameilia] I've never
seen this many numbers!

55:27.591 --> 55:29.424
- [Michelle] This is amazing.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.760
- [Ameilia] I don't
know what to say.

55:31.829 --> 55:32.861
I want to give you a hug.

55:32.929 --> 55:38.600
I've got dogs
everywhere, thank you.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.535
- That's not all, we're
going to be opening

55:40.604 --> 55:42.003
Doggy Daycares right around

55:42.072 --> 55:44.172
the state, and the country.

55:44.241 --> 55:52.241
- No way, oh my gosh!

55:52.483 --> 55:53.815
I love you.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.149
- [Michelle] Hey,
you know what, Meils?

55:55.218 --> 55:56.217
- [Ameilia] What?
- The family that we have now

55:56.286 --> 55:58.487
is what matters most.

55:58.555 --> 56:04.760
- [Mutt] Doggy Daycare is saved.

56:04.828 --> 56:12.828
(uplifting music)

56:33.023 --> 56:41.023
- Doggy Daycare is saved, woo!

56:41.865 --> 56:43.965
- [Sarah] I love you, Mutt.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.534
- I love you guys!

56:45.602 --> 56:47.569
- [Dogcatcher] Aww,
well, yeah, okay!

56:47.638 --> 56:48.937
- Group hug!

56:49.005 --> 56:50.405
- [All] Woo!

56:50.474 --> 56:51.554
- [LL] We did it guys!

56:51.608 --> 56:58.780
- [Ameilia] I'm so
happy, thanks everyone!

56:58.849 --> 57:01.149
- [Bruce] Come
on, Sonny, woohoo!

57:01.217 --> 57:04.653
- [Sonny] Ahhh,
finally, some peace,

57:04.721 --> 57:08.156
and quiet from all
these melonheads.

57:08.224 --> 57:09.724
- [Guts] See any
treats around here?

57:09.793 --> 57:11.460
I am so hungry!

57:11.528 --> 57:14.796
- [Sonny] Ahh, geesh!

57:14.865 --> 57:22.865
(upbeat music)
