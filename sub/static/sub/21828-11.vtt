WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.250
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:05.333 --> 00:07.792
We'll take Mech-X4 up to the Arctic,
we'll take on Traeger.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.500
Mech execute!

00:09.917 --> 00:11.250
And we'll destroy the weapon,

00:11.333 --> 00:13.583
and then we'll get back
before anybody else misses us.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.208
And now I don't need them alive anymore.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.041
Abandon the robot, get to the escape pod!

00:24.583 --> 00:26.041
Mark, here!

00:32.125 --> 00:33.000
Ryan!

00:41.834 --> 00:43.583
(roaring)

00:46.500 --> 00:48.041
(whimpers)

00:48.625 --> 00:52.041
(Mark) Ryan? Ryan!

00:53.125 --> 00:55.417
(wind howling)

00:58.333 --> 00:59.166
(Spyder) Ryan?

00:59.875 --> 01:00.792
(Veracity) Ryan?

01:01.834 --> 01:02.709
Ryan?

01:03.875 --> 01:05.041
Ryan!

01:05.125 --> 01:06.917
-(phone chirps)
-Ryan!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.417
Ryan, are you there?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.667
-(phone chimes)
-We don't have any signal.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.041
We're stranded.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.417
-I can't believe Ryan did that.
-He tried to save us.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.917
I'm his big brother,
I should have saved him.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.125
And now... what if he's...

01:20.208 --> 01:21.875
There's gotta be a way to get back home.

01:21.959 --> 01:23.291
You know, a backup plan?

01:25.166 --> 01:27.417
-(roaring)
-(gasping)

01:31.834 --> 01:34.500
Great! So we're not gonna freeze,
we're just gonna get eaten.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.083
(roars)

01:40.458 --> 01:42.500
(Spyder) Harper.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.041
Hey, guys!

01:49.125 --> 01:50.959
Looks like you need a lift.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.458
Oh, come on. Cheer up.

01:53.542 --> 01:57.083
I'm saving you from freezing to death
out here. You're welcome.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.333
Wait.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.208
Where's Ryan?

02:06.458 --> 02:09.375
(theme music playing)

02:45.834 --> 02:48.250
Welcome to my Arctic headquarters.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.458
Of course you have an Arctic base.
You're a villain.

02:50.542 --> 02:52.667
Do you have a little cat to pet
while you're scheming?

02:52.750 --> 02:54.208
Shark in the tank?

02:54.291 --> 02:56.000
A laser to cut people in half?

02:56.083 --> 02:58.834
We lost the cat to the shark.
I really don't want to talk about it.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.458
I don't know why you're helping us,

03:00.542 --> 03:02.333
but we don't want anything to do with you.

03:02.417 --> 03:03.250
Okay, slow it up.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.834
If you guys want to find Ryan,
I'm the only game in town.

03:05.917 --> 03:06.917
Snowboarding is a game.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.500
-I... Listen--
-Hockey, curling.

03:08.583 --> 03:11.417
-Man, I forgot how much I despise you!
-I have a gift.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.959
Listen, take it from a guy
who's tried to kill Ryan

03:14.041 --> 03:16.375
on several occasions,

03:16.458 --> 03:18.583
he's not going down that easy.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.166
Probably a better way to put that.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.583
Scrooge McDeath could have let us
freeze out there,

03:22.667 --> 03:25.083
so let's at least listen to him.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.250
I like her. Good addition to the team.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.458
Is she replacing Spyder? No? Listen.

03:30.542 --> 03:33.834
Grey and that red thing held me prisoner.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.250
Nobody does that to Seth Harper.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.125
So, this is about revenge?

03:37.208 --> 03:40.875
Aren't most things?
And I can't beat them on my own.

03:40.959 --> 03:46.500
And clearly, you can't either, so...
we have to work together.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.083
Hm.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.208
(Harper)
Look, it is freezing cold out there.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.125
If Ryan is alive,
you need my help to find him.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.667
-Not happening.
-No way.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.583
Yes.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.709
It is happening.

04:03.166 --> 04:06.333
I'll do whatever it takes to save Ryan,
even if that means working with you.

04:06.417 --> 04:09.500
Because I am the only game in--

04:09.583 --> 04:11.792
-Dogsledding.
-Ugh! I hate you.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.375
Our pod landed somewhere around here,

04:18.458 --> 04:22.500
which probably means
that the robot is somewhere around here.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.125
I don't see any sign of the giant ocean
or red ooze.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.959
Traeger must've figured out
how to move it.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.583
Thank you, Morris. That'll be all.

04:32.667 --> 04:36.667
-You named your drone after your henchmen?
-Oh, I name all my henchmen Morris.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.750
Makes things a lot easier when they,
you know...

04:39.333 --> 04:40.709
Boss of the year.

04:40.792 --> 04:41.625
Oh, that reminds me.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.375
You and Harris owe me final versions
of Harper Grant projects.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.000
-Nope.
-I'll email it to you later.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.291
-My man!
-Wow!

04:47.375 --> 04:49.250
-(computer chirps)
-There.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.208
Bingo!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.333
No heat signatures.

04:54.417 --> 04:56.458
Are you saying you can't detect any heat
from Ryan?

04:56.542 --> 04:58.166
Does... Does that mean...

04:58.250 --> 04:59.834
Don't jump to conclusions.

04:59.917 --> 05:02.041
I'm guessing the robot's hull
is frozen over.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.208
(Harper)
My scanners can't penetrate that much ice.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.500
Which means Ryan could still be alive
in other halves.

05:06.583 --> 05:09.000
But doesn't that mean
someone else could be alive in there?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.125
-Like Traeger?
-We need to split up.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.125
Search both halves of the robot.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.959
-Veracity, Spyder, you guys take the legs.
-Okay.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.291
Harris and I will go with Harper
to the top.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.250
Harper and Mark, together again.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.000
Just like that time we tried to get
into that DJ Live-Rat$z show.

05:23.083 --> 05:26.417
No, you're coming with me
because I don't trust you.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.083
(chuckles)
Classic Mark. I miss us, man.

05:30.625 --> 05:33.625
(suspenseful music playing)

05:45.709 --> 05:46.542
Cozy.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.458
-Ryan!
-Shh!

05:50.542 --> 05:52.125
We don't know if Traeger's in here.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.458
We have to stay hidden,
it's our only advantage.

05:54.542 --> 05:58.208
Good point.
My training regime has been mostly cardio.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.792
Not really up for fighting hand-to-hand
with an invincible ooze monster.

06:01.875 --> 06:05.041
I'll go to the control center
and get the internal sensors online,

06:05.125 --> 06:06.458
you look for Ryan.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.458
Hey! You're not in charge here.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.875
Aggressive! Bold!

06:10.959 --> 06:14.417
I like it.
Okay, sir, what would you like to do?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.875
(exhales)
Okay.

06:16.959 --> 06:21.000
You get the internal sensors online,
and I'll look for Ryan.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.125
You know that's the exact same plan,
right?

06:26.542 --> 06:29.875
But... somehow better.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.250
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.458
(door opens)

06:50.417 --> 06:52.500
Hey, stay close!

06:52.583 --> 06:54.250
Oh, you want me to protect you.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.500
(chuckles)
Yeah, like a human shield.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.000
-I'll take it.
-Come on, Ryan, where are you?

07:23.834 --> 07:28.041
(footsteps approaching)

07:40.583 --> 07:42.542
(growls)

07:47.792 --> 07:50.250
(growling)

07:59.667 --> 08:01.834
Traeger: Get back here, Ryan!

08:01.917 --> 08:03.333
No!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.083
(Traeger growls)

08:13.166 --> 08:15.583
-Whoa! Ah!
-Ryan!

08:18.125 --> 08:19.250
Ryan!

08:26.458 --> 08:27.750
Ryan!

08:27.834 --> 08:28.667
No!

08:38.041 --> 08:40.208
(panting)

08:45.625 --> 08:47.125
Whoa.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.917
-(clanging)
-It's Ryan!

08:57.000 --> 08:58.750
No, no, no, that could be anything!

08:58.834 --> 09:00.291
Hey, let's go...

09:00.375 --> 09:02.250
(growling, barking)

09:02.333 --> 09:04.959
Wolf, wolf, wolf!

09:05.041 --> 09:06.333
Worse, wolves.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.542
-Are you sure that's the right plural?
-Just hide!

09:10.583 --> 09:12.250
(barking)

09:12.333 --> 09:16.291
Eek! Eek! Eek!

09:16.375 --> 09:19.166
They're wolves, Veracity,
I'm not embarrassed about saying eek!

09:21.125 --> 09:23.500
Dude, I am scared too,
but you gotta work with me here!

09:23.583 --> 09:25.542
-Okay, you're right.
-Yeah.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.417
-I'm okay, I'm okay.
-You're okay. Yeah.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no way out!

09:30.333 --> 09:32.417
-You trapped me in a room with one door!
-Hey, hey!

09:32.500 --> 09:35.458
Ah! The wolves can smell my tender meat!

09:36.667 --> 09:38.458
And I just realized
what human shield means!

09:38.542 --> 09:40.125
(screams)

09:47.083 --> 09:49.917
-(watch chirps)
-Hey guys, I'm leaving you this recording.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Hope you find it.
Traeger's in the robot with me.

09:53.917 --> 09:57.166
It looks like all these anti-ooze cannons
got busted up during the battle.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.834
I need to think of something else.

10:02.667 --> 10:06.041
Come on. Oh!

10:08.792 --> 10:10.917
"Spyder's Secret Weapon Stash." Yes!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.166
-(watch chirps)
-Spyder, if you ever hear this,

10:13.250 --> 10:14.709
I owe you my life.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.417
Although you spelled "weapon"
and your own name wrong...

10:17.500 --> 10:18.417
Seriously?

10:21.041 --> 10:24.667
Yes! I knew you'd hoard one of these,
you lunatic packrat.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.291
Gravity Pucks!

10:26.375 --> 10:27.417
(Traeger growls)

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
Gotta make it as hard as possible for him.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.458
Dang!

11:07.834 --> 11:10.041
Ryan? Ryan, you there?

11:18.625 --> 11:19.750
Whoo!

11:20.625 --> 11:22.709
I am the man.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.166
Internal sensors are back online.
All right, give it up!

11:28.041 --> 11:31.709
Oh, right, I'm all alone.
And they hate me.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.792
(clanging on monitor)

11:37.291 --> 11:38.667
Hey, guys.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.542
I think I know where Ryan is.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.458
What are you doing?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.417
Worrying myself by your angry,
hateful breath.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.458
-(barking)
-Whoa!

11:54.542 --> 11:56.041
Uh! I wish I had a paper clip.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.542
Do you want a bobby pin?

11:58.625 --> 11:59.792
Why do you have a bobby pin?

11:59.875 --> 12:04.041
To pick locks. I mean, uh...
Keep my smooth hair in place...

12:04.125 --> 12:05.959
-(barking)
-(gasps)

12:08.000 --> 12:10.208
Please tell me whatever you're doing
is gonna work.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.709
I don't get it,
you guys have fought tons of monsters

12:12.792 --> 12:15.583
-and now you're freaking out over wolves?
-(whimpers)

12:15.667 --> 12:20.834
Dude, wolves...
are able to imitate your grandmother.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.500
They fooled that girl in the red hood.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.667
They're sneaky.

12:23.750 --> 12:26.166
(Spyder) A fact that I thought was cool
until right now!

12:26.250 --> 12:29.500
Okay, messing with the speaker
until it starts producing feedback.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.000
-(loud feedback)
-Oh! Ow!

12:31.083 --> 12:32.667
-Loud!
-That's the point.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.333
A sound to drive the wolves away.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.917
(screeching)

12:40.000 --> 12:43.208
(barking)

12:43.709 --> 12:44.542
Did it work?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.000
(both gasp)

13:03.917 --> 13:05.667
Yo, Traeger!

13:13.792 --> 13:15.333
Don't move, Traeger!

13:16.542 --> 13:19.500
Ryan, why are you calling me Traeger?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.500
Ah, ah!

13:24.875 --> 13:27.458
Ryan! It's me! It's Mark!

13:34.917 --> 13:37.834
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on down there?
Mark!

13:37.917 --> 13:39.458
Look at me, Ryan.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.667
Ryan, what are you doing?

13:41.500 --> 13:44.166
(groaning)

13:44.250 --> 13:45.500
Ryan...

13:46.834 --> 13:48.625
You think I'm stupid, Traeger?

13:49.458 --> 13:52.083
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

13:52.166 --> 13:53.792
Ryan, what are you doing to Mark?

13:57.458 --> 13:58.667
Okay, don't move, Ryan.

13:59.458 --> 14:02.750
(gasping)
How are you doing that?

14:02.834 --> 14:05.291
-Don't run, Ryan.
-Just stay there.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.834
-Traeger.
-Traeger?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.125
Look at me, Ryan.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.750
He's acting like his brain is fried
or something.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.000
(Mark) Ryan, wait, come back!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.291
We found Ryan... but he's crazy.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.625
He's seeing us as enemies.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.041
It must have something to do
with the damage to Mech-X4.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.750
-(wolves growling)
-(both gasp)

14:32.834 --> 14:33.667
Focus on Ryan.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.625
(Harris) Ryan was still connected
to the robot when it got ripped.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.959
It's almost like his mind
got ripped in half, too.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.542
And the last thing he saw... was Traeger!

14:41.625 --> 14:43.959
It's like his brain is stuck in a loop,
like a computer.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.041
How do we fix it?

14:45.125 --> 14:46.750
Maybe I can...

14:47.375 --> 14:48.542
(both) Reboot him.

14:48.625 --> 14:52.000
It's possible.
We'd have to reset all the robot systems.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.750
But Ryan needs to be on the control pad.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.125
That's where his connection to Mech-X4
is the strongest.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.041
The reboot can only be done
from the CPU core

14:58.125 --> 14:59.875
and that's in the lower half of the robot.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.458
Spyder, Veracity,
you guys anywhere close to the CPU core?

15:02.542 --> 15:05.834
Uh, yeah, we're pretty close.
Got a bit of an animal control problem.

15:05.917 --> 15:06.750
-(barking)
-Oh!

15:06.834 --> 15:08.166
That does not sound good.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.041
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.750
-What?
-So we can run the reboot program

15:11.834 --> 15:12.667
from here...

15:12.750 --> 15:16.041
but we're gonna have to connect the two
halves of the robot to the same network.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.125
Harris will handle that.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.875
Yeah, Harris will... Wait. What?

15:19.959 --> 15:21.917
I'll try to push Ryan back
to the control pad.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.125
You connect the robot halves.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.000
I've got fiber optic cable
in the workshop.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.750
You're always bragging
about how much fiber optic cable you have.

15:27.834 --> 15:29.208
I like it, I will not apologize.

15:29.291 --> 15:32.125
Just one question: How do I get
to the other half of the robot?

15:32.208 --> 15:34.083
-Shh!
-Oh!

15:35.166 --> 15:38.250
Look, those things are gonna tear
Harris apart if we don't get rid of them.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.625
Oh, man.

15:40.709 --> 15:44.208
Only one thing to do.
This is not gonna be fun.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.542
I can't find Ryan.
How do I get into the control pad?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.417
Not a problem, amigo.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.959
Hey, buddy.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, listen to me.

15:55.166 --> 15:58.667
Your mind was affected
when the robot was ripped in half.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.458
You're seeing your friends as enemies!

16:01.542 --> 16:03.333
So we've gotta reboot that brain, pal.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.875
(screams)

16:05.959 --> 16:09.208
-Look, you attacked Mark.
-No, I attacked you, Traeger.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.000
I'm not Traeger. It's me, Harper!

16:13.083 --> 16:15.041
Actually, I guess that's not much better,
is it?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.500
(grunts)

16:19.000 --> 16:21.375
Ah, aww!

16:21.458 --> 16:23.125
That's feeling better.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.291
(groans)

16:34.417 --> 16:36.208
Oh. Okay.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.125
All right, now we're talking.

16:44.583 --> 16:48.291
He has so much cable!

16:49.583 --> 16:51.834
One human shield coming up!

16:51.917 --> 16:54.333
Hey, where my wolves at?

16:54.417 --> 16:55.500
(barking)

16:55.583 --> 16:56.792
This isn't so bad.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.959
Think of friendly cartoon wolves
you've seen.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.542
Wait, there are none.
They're all villains.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.083
Sure you know what you're doing?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.834
Yeah, being a human shield.

17:04.917 --> 17:06.125
Tender meat!

17:08.125 --> 17:10.000
Eek! Eek!

17:13.417 --> 17:17.333
(Spyder screaming)

17:17.417 --> 17:19.250
You're a very brave human shield.

17:20.709 --> 17:23.000
-(panting)
-Harris?

17:23.083 --> 17:24.500
(groans)

17:28.083 --> 17:29.041
Bam, baby!

17:29.125 --> 17:32.500
You are looking at the bravest boy
in the northern hemisphere!

17:32.583 --> 17:34.125
This guy just rode Ryan's hoverboard!

17:36.125 --> 17:37.667
-(Spyder screams)
-What?

17:38.750 --> 17:40.458
Get ready to reboot the systems.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.291
Ryan!

17:43.375 --> 17:44.875
Ryan!

17:44.959 --> 17:45.792
Ryan?

17:49.041 --> 17:50.333
Hey, hey! Dude, listen to me.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.625
You're not thinking straight.
It's me, Mark.

17:53.583 --> 17:56.542
Stop saying that, Traeger.
You're not gonna fool me.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.917
Whoa, hey! You... You recognize this?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.333
(Mark) You bought this for Mom.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.625
How would Traeger have this?

18:13.792 --> 18:15.750
Who's the last person you gave this to?
Think.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.166
This is for your own good, dingus.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.333
(grunts)

18:24.834 --> 18:25.667
Ah!

18:25.750 --> 18:27.083
Now!

18:27.625 --> 18:29.333
(power surging)

18:29.417 --> 18:35.625
(grunting)

18:37.041 --> 18:38.792
Ahh!

18:38.875 --> 18:41.583
(panting)

18:41.667 --> 18:45.208
-Hi, there! Welcome to Mech-X4!
-Whoa!

18:45.291 --> 18:48.166
Oh! He does not have a face for IMAX.

18:51.000 --> 18:51.875
(Mark) Ryan?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.250
Mark? Ah!

18:56.333 --> 18:57.709
For ejecting me out of the robot.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.792
-I was trying to save you.
-We stick together,

18:59.875 --> 19:01.375
even if that means losing together.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.291
Aw.
(chuckles)

19:07.750 --> 19:09.750
Is that Harper? Am I seeing things?

19:09.834 --> 19:11.500
Nope, I'm the real deal.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.000
-Hey! No, no, no, Ryan.
-Oh!

19:13.750 --> 19:15.125
He saved us.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.458
He helped us fix your brain, we need him.

19:17.542 --> 19:18.917
-For what?
-(Harper) Listen,

19:19.000 --> 19:23.166
your robot just got torn apart.
Luckily, I can help you.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.750
(beep, whirring)

19:26.834 --> 19:29.125
Is anybody gonna help me
with these stupid wolves?

19:29.208 --> 19:31.458
(Spyder screams)

19:31.542 --> 19:33.041
Just gotta handle something first.

19:33.667 --> 19:34.750
(Ryan) Hang on, Spyder.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.542
Are you sure?

19:39.208 --> 19:40.500
It's just Spyder, we could...

19:42.709 --> 19:45.375
(Harper) Okay, I'll take care
of everything up here. We're good.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.375
Where'd you find these robot pieces?

19:56.625 --> 19:59.041
Find them? No, no, no, no.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.417
I built them.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.208
Wait, you're building your own robot?

20:02.291 --> 20:04.917
Okay, funny story. You're gonna love this.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.709
Since your robot was always defeating
my monsters,

20:07.792 --> 20:12.083
I figured I'd build my own to, you know,
destroy everything that you love.

20:12.166 --> 20:14.375
Now that I say it out loud,
it's not quite as funny.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.917
This supposed to make me trust you?

20:16.000 --> 20:21.417
Fair point, but look, now we can use these
parts to rebuild and upgrade Mech-X4.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.458
(whirrs)

20:30.917 --> 20:32.083
Nice.

20:34.959 --> 20:39.625
Listen, I know... you don't trust me.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.250
But together, we can defeat Traeger.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.000
What do you say?

20:45.792 --> 20:47.083
Do we have a deal?

21:08.959 --> 21:09.792
(sighs)

21:12.917 --> 21:17.333
This is, um... this is my last option.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.875
Are you sure you want to take this risk?

21:21.250 --> 21:22.583
Do I have another choice?

21:23.417 --> 21:25.625
No. I guess not.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.125
Okay.

21:34.208 --> 21:35.166
(clears throat)

21:41.959 --> 21:45.000
If this doesn't work, tell Ryan...

21:45.083 --> 21:47.125
(groaning)

21:47.208 --> 21:48.417
Violet.

21:49.250 --> 21:55.417
-(screaming)
-Violet! Violet!

21:56.458 --> 21:58.625
Oh, no. Hold her down.

21:58.709 --> 21:59.792
(groaning)

22:03.291 --> 22:07.625
(theme music playing)

22:29.375 --> 22:30.250
(barking)
