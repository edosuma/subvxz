00:01.667 --> 00:03.542
[instrumental music]

00:03.625 --> 00:05.667
(Turval)
'Meditation shapes us.'

00:05.750 --> 00:08.667
It makes us strong
but keeps us flexible

00:08.750 --> 00:11.208
as fluid as thought itself

00:11.292 --> 00:13.625
as invisible as the night.

00:14.875 --> 00:18.083
Is there something
troubling you, Rastenn?

00:18.167 --> 00:20.583
Apologies, master, but..

00:20.667 --> 00:24.083
...how can we reach a state
of meditation when..

00:26.000 --> 00:30.583
...that is, your voice
can be very...distracting.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.750
Because you are
listening to the voice

00:32.833 --> 00:35.250
and not the thoughts
behind it.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.250
To be Anla'Shok

00:37.333 --> 00:41.167
you must be able to go inside
under all circumstances

00:41.250 --> 00:44.875
even waiting
to go into battle..

00:44.958 --> 00:46.542
[snoring]

00:48.375 --> 00:50.292
...without falling asleep.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.708
Anyone can meditate
in silence.

00:54.792 --> 00:58.708
That is hardly a challenge
worthy of a ranger.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.208
A challenge is to stand alone

01:01.292 --> 01:04.750
unarmed, prepared to die.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.792
I would hardly say sitting
and thinking is a challenge.

01:08.875 --> 01:12.625
True, you do seem to have the
sitting part down to an art

01:12.708 --> 01:14.750
so I suppose there's hope.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.458
As for thinking,
well, uh..

01:17.542 --> 01:20.125
...let's leave that
for the advanced classes.

01:20.208 --> 01:23.292
We shouldn't expect too much
of you at once.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.292
We'll worry about thinking
once we've cleared away

01:26.375 --> 01:29.167
all that warrior caste nonsense.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.958
Nonsense, Sech Turval?

01:32.042 --> 01:34.917
Apologies. The choice of words--

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Was unfortunate?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.125
In error?

01:40.333 --> 01:42.833
Untimely, Sech Durhan.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.792
Return to your meditations.

01:47.875 --> 01:52.125
Turval, we have just received
a message from Delenn.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.958
She would like a report
on our progress here.

01:55.042 --> 01:57.917
She's asked for me to come
and to bring one other along.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.208
And you have chosen me?
I am honored.

02:01.292 --> 02:04.167
It's good to know
that at my advanced age

02:04.250 --> 02:08.208
there is still respect
for wisdom and perception.

02:08.292 --> 02:11.125
Everyone else was busy.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.500
[laughs]

02:13.583 --> 02:16.708
You are a source of constant
annoyance to me, Turval.

02:16.792 --> 02:20.042
But only because you're right
more often than you're wrong.

02:20.125 --> 02:23.583
And why should I keep this joy
to myself?

02:23.667 --> 02:26.167
I choose to share you
with the universe.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.375
Valen help them all.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.875
[giggling]

02:31.958 --> 02:33.833
Tannier.

02:33.917 --> 02:35.375
(Turval)
'You were supposed
to be listening'

02:35.458 --> 02:37.083
'only to your inner voice.'

02:37.167 --> 02:38.500
I was, master.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.083
My inner voice was smiling.

02:41.167 --> 02:44.625
No one has an inner voice
that smiles.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.000
I do.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.167
I'd expect that

02:49.250 --> 02:51.417
from the religious caste.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.750
Alright, Turval.
Choose your escorts.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.667
Meet me at the landing platform.

02:55.750 --> 02:59.000
We leave for Babylon 5
...in one hour.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.625
Yes, Durhan.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.750
[instrumental music]

03:03.833 --> 03:05.542
[sighs]

03:05.625 --> 03:07.625
You..

03:07.708 --> 03:09.750
...and you come with me.

03:09.833 --> 03:13.750
Since you seem incapable
of meditating in silence

03:13.833 --> 03:17.042
going somewhere else
might be a good idea.

03:19.958 --> 03:23.042
Babylon 5,
the home of peace.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.875
[groaning]

03:28.208 --> 03:30.292
[dramatic music]

03:32.042 --> 03:33.500
[clicking tongue]

03:33.583 --> 03:35.708
You're behind
on payments, Lex.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.292
Look at you.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.792
You insult me.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.583
Now I have to make sure
everybody understands

03:43.667 --> 03:47.167
that you don't keep Trace
waiting for his money.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.833
Do it.

03:48.917 --> 03:50.458
(Lex)
'No! No!'

03:50.542 --> 03:51.792
[zaps]

03:53.708 --> 03:55.958
Leave the body
where they'll find it.

03:56.042 --> 03:59.542
I want everyone to know
there's a new power in town.

03:59.625 --> 04:03.583
'Cause from now on
Babylon 5 belongs to me.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.125
And anyone
that doesn't understand that..

04:06.208 --> 04:08.167
...is gonna get exactly
the same.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.083
[music continues]

04:12.458 --> 04:14.250
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

04:14.333 --> 04:16.792
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

04:16.875 --> 04:18.708
(G'kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.583
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.750
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.875
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld?

04:24.958 --> 04:27.792
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.292
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

04:29.375 --> 04:32.083
a decree today
declaring martial law.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.458
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence..

04:34.542 --> 04:35.875
(Sheridan)
Unless your people get off
their encounter-suited butts

04:35.958 --> 04:37.125
and do something.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.708
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

04:38.792 --> 04:41.542
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum will die.

04:41.625 --> 04:43.042
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:43.125 --> 04:45.000
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:45.083 --> 04:46.583
(Delenn)
I think of
my beautiful city in flames.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.042
(Sheridan)
Giants in the play ground.

04:48.125 --> 04:49.792
Now get the hell out
of our galaxy!

04:49.875 --> 04:52.292
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.417
[theme music]

05:25.625 --> 05:28.667
[music continues]

05:40.708 --> 05:43.125
[dramatic music]

05:53.125 --> 05:56.375
(man #1 on speaker)
'Maintenance Chief Willis
to docking bay four.'

05:56.458 --> 05:59.167
'Chief Willis
to docking bay four.'

05:59.250 --> 06:01.250
(male #1)
'Seal off that fuel clamp.'

06:02.792 --> 06:04.667
Greetings, Entil'Zha.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.792
Sech Durhan, welcome.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.208
Sech Turval,
it's good to see you again.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.708
And you, Delenn.

06:10.792 --> 06:13.250
We are honored
that you would come and meet us.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.292
I don't believe in
standing on protocol.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.333
Since this is your first time
on Babylon 5

06:17.417 --> 06:19.625
I decided to show you
around myself.

06:19.708 --> 06:21.667
Thank you. Then we should, uh--

06:21.750 --> 06:23.000
And who are these?

06:23.083 --> 06:25.292
Oh, two of our newest recruits.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.792
'This is Tannier.'

06:26.875 --> 06:29.958
'He comes to the Anla'Shok
from the religious caste.'

06:30.042 --> 06:31.583
'And that's Rastenn'

06:31.667 --> 06:34.625
uh, originally from
the warrior caste.

06:34.708 --> 06:37.083
Since you wanted to know
how things were

06:37.167 --> 06:38.917
it seemed best to introduce you

06:39.000 --> 06:42.125
to some of our more
recent additions.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.667
Entil'Zha, Delenn,
it is an honor to--

06:44.750 --> 06:46.833
Speak when spoken to.

06:46.917 --> 06:49.250
Apologies, master.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.875
Well, uh, if you would
come this way.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.708
Thank you, Tannier.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.917
[instrumental music]

07:05.708 --> 07:07.333
[sighs]

07:07.417 --> 07:11.167
Hey, Zack.
Come on. Have a seat.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.708
Hey, morning.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.375
I was gonna give you a call.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.583
Got word from Byron about
those telepaths you wanted.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.333
He's gonna send over
a couple of candidates

07:18.417 --> 07:20.625
to meet you later on today.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.292
It's good to see you
down here again.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.458
Didn't know whether you'd still
hang around with us grunts

07:24.542 --> 07:26.917
promoted.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.667
It's still just
little ol' me, Zack.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.958
I don't change.
I don't have the time.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
Captain.

07:35.583 --> 07:36.792
There's nothing wrong
with the chair here.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.792
Why don't you, uh, join us?

07:39.958 --> 07:41.583
[clears throat]

07:41.667 --> 07:42.958
Gentlemen.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.542
So, how's it going?

07:45.625 --> 07:48.375
Fine, fine, I'm just, uh,
revising the rotation schedule

07:48.458 --> 07:50.542
for Starfury pilots
on station patrol.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.250
We, uh, need to be
more efficient.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.042
Keep more fighters outside
without putting

07:54.125 --> 07:55.708
too much of a burden
on the pilots.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.375
Uh, good luck,
during the fighting last year

07:57.458 --> 07:59.292
we lost a lot of fighters.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.875
We're down to only about two
thirds of what we should have.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.583
Well, since Earth
joined the new alliance

08:03.667 --> 08:06.375
maybe we can ask them to send
along some more replacements.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.458
You're on good terms with
the administration, captain.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.375
You could ask them for us.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.167
You're giving me far too much
credit, Mr. Garibaldi.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.417
- You think?
- I do.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.042
- Maybe we should, uh--
- You know..

08:15.125 --> 08:17.167
It just occurred to me that
since you were on the other side

08:17.250 --> 08:20.042
during the Civil War back home
you might feel some

08:20.125 --> 08:22.583
I don't know, obligation to help
replace some of the fighters

08:22.667 --> 08:24.833
we lost during the campaign.

08:24.917 --> 08:27.250
Who said I was
on the other side?

08:27.333 --> 08:28.792
Well, I certainly didn't hear
your name mentioned

08:28.875 --> 08:30.542
by anybody on our side.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.042
Does anybody else think
this food tastes funny?

08:33.125 --> 08:36.042
So you think there are only
two sides to any argument?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.542
I think it's saffron.
I hate saffron.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.542
In this case, yeah.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.083
Now, there have been
a lot of rumors about you

08:42.167 --> 08:43.708
since you got on board
this station, captain.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.292
Maybe everybody else
is afraid to ask.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.875
I don't have that problem.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.250
You see, I don't work for you.
I answer only to Sheridan.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.250
So I wanna know, just for me,
which side were you on?

09:00.500 --> 09:03.292
Okay. You're right.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.583
I wasn't on your side.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.167
I was on the side
that says

09:07.250 --> 09:10.042
it's not the role of
the military to set policy

09:10.125 --> 09:13.958
or depose presidents
or fire on our own ships.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.958
We follow orders
until one comes along

09:16.042 --> 09:18.333
that violates our conscience.

09:18.417 --> 09:20.458
Then we have to decide
whether or not to follow it

09:20.542 --> 09:22.708
and take the consequences.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.542
Maybe you'll be proven right.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.750
Maybe they'll stick you
in front of a firing squad

09:26.833 --> 09:29.292
but your decision
affects only you.

09:29.375 --> 09:33.458
You can take a stand without
destroying the chain of command.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.208
And did you?
Did you take a stand?

09:36.292 --> 09:38.875
Well, now, that's none of
your concern, Mr. Garibaldi.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.958
You asked me if I took up arms
against my own government.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.333
The answer is no.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.375
My job is to protect
the men and women

09:46.458 --> 09:49.500
who serve under my command
and I will perform that job

09:49.583 --> 09:51.667
with every last breath I've got

09:51.750 --> 09:53.333
'cause I owe them nothing less.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.250
And to hell with
the rest of the world.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.708
Well, now, there you have me at
a disadvantage, Mr. Garibaldi.

09:57.792 --> 10:01.625
You see, I don't know what's
best for the whole world.

10:01.708 --> 10:05.208
I don't understand the ethical
structure of the universe

10:05.292 --> 10:07.000
and I sure as hell
don't think it's my place

10:07.083 --> 10:09.958
to tear up the constitution
I swore an oath to protect.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.917
I am a soldier,
Mr. Garibaldi.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.042
And as such, my vocabulary
is rather limited.

10:19.125 --> 10:22.667
I only really
understand three words..

10:22.750 --> 10:27.042
"...loyalty, duty, honor."

10:27.125 --> 10:30.458
If I did it your way,
one of those would have to go.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.708
Then the other two
would become meaningless..

10:33.792 --> 10:35.875
...just like this conversation.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.667
Good day.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.792
[applauding]

10:43.917 --> 10:47.000
Garlic. I think it's garlic.

10:52.542 --> 10:53.667
[beeps]

10:55.083 --> 10:57.208
Red two.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.625
- Mr. President.
- Captain.

10:59.708 --> 11:02.833
- How's it going?
- Fine. Fine.

11:02.917 --> 11:08.583
[sighs]
I just had a very frank and open
conversation with Mr. Garibaldi.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.375
- Uh-oh.
- No, no. He was good.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.250
Obviously, there are some issues
that need to be addressed.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.833
At least now they're out on
the table where we can see them.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.125
Meaning he doesn't trust you.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.958
Not as far
as he can throw me.

11:22.042 --> 11:24.042
Yeah. You want me
to talk to him?

11:24.125 --> 11:26.417
No. But thank you.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.792
No, he's-he's my problem
...not yours.

11:29.875 --> 11:32.792
You know, if I can't handle him,
I shouldn't be here.

11:32.875 --> 11:36.083
And I will,
in my own time, my own way.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.375
You're having second thoughts
about taking the position?

11:41.458 --> 11:42.750
No, sir.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.500
No, if anything
this confirms that

11:46.583 --> 11:49.625
I am exactly
where I need to be.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.167
Why, are you having
second thoughts?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.875
None whatsoever,
I picked you for a reason

11:53.958 --> 11:56.833
and I have every confidence
in that decision.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.083
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

11:59.167 --> 12:02.500
Michael will come around,
eventually.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.125
- He's a good man.
- I know. I just--

12:05.208 --> 12:06.792
I just never thought
I'd meet a second man

12:06.875 --> 12:10.167
as strong-willed, stubborn,
and annoying as I am.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.083
"My cup runneth over."

12:16.500 --> 12:18.625
Got here as soon as I could.
Let me see.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.833
Looks like a single PPG
burst fired at close range

12:27.917 --> 12:30.625
same as the last one.
Any ID?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.500
Name's Lex Mereau.

12:32.583 --> 12:36.958
Got here two weeks ago, ran up
a line of credit at the casino..

12:37.042 --> 12:38.667
...then disappeared.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.417
Interesting.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.875
The heat from a PPG burst
takes a few seconds

12:42.958 --> 12:44.500
to cauterize the wound.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.792
You get a fair amount
of bleeding before then.

12:47.708 --> 12:48.958
There's no blood on the deck

12:49.042 --> 12:51.417
meaning he was killed
somewhere else

12:51.500 --> 12:53.875
left out in the open..

12:53.958 --> 12:55.542
...probably as a warning.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.167
I don't suppose
any of you saw anything?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.125
Heard anything?

13:10.000 --> 13:13.167
Look, this is the third murder
in two weeks.

13:13.250 --> 13:17.208
All execution style,
all with a single PPG hit.

13:17.292 --> 13:19.625
Now, my guess
is there's gonna be more

13:19.708 --> 13:22.750
until the guy who's doing this
makes his point.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.417
Unless he already has..

13:25.500 --> 13:29.208
...unless the fear coming off
all of you was his goal.

13:29.292 --> 13:32.917
Now, either way,
unless you help us help you..

13:33.000 --> 13:35.208
...there's gonna be
more killing.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.708
Probably, one of you
will be next.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.833
[dramatic music]

13:43.208 --> 13:46.417
Alright, bag him, number him,
put him in with the rest.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.250
I'll be in the office.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.292
The stink around here
is starting to get to me.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.458
[indistinct chatter]

13:58.542 --> 14:00.667
Smart guy.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.333
Figured out a lot
just by looking at the body.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.417
He's a good talker, too.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.958
Looks like he had
some of them convinced.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.958
Take him out. Tonight.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.750
[theme music]

14:30.208 --> 14:33.750
Trace, listen, uh, I know you
got your mind made up on Zack.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.000
That's right.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.583
Yeah, well, I-I just wanted..

14:37.667 --> 14:39.042
See, you're new here.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.958
The big guys don't back down
when you hit them hard.

14:42.042 --> 14:43.917
Now, we got a good thing going.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Ever since N'grath went down,
there's been a vacuum

14:46.083 --> 14:47.792
in the power structure.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.750
We have the muscle to take over
all the Downbelow rackets.

14:50.833 --> 14:55.375
Fencing, extortion, hookers
...the whole thing.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.458
But you got to keep
a low profile.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.250
You go after Zack

15:00.333 --> 15:02.958
you'll have the whole station
down around our necks.

15:03.042 --> 15:04.583
Listen.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.500
The last place
I had an operation like this

15:06.583 --> 15:09.375
was Beta Seven.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.625
And there was a guy like Allan
in charge of security

15:11.708 --> 15:14.167
for the whole colony.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.667
But a lot of guys under him

15:16.750 --> 15:18.958
didn't like like him
any more than we did.

15:19.042 --> 15:22.167
So me and the boys..
Bam!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.750
We took him out.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.500
The next guy
came after us hard.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.542
So we took him out, too.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.583
[intense music]

15:31.667 --> 15:33.625
And you know what?

15:33.708 --> 15:36.125
The third guy was just like us.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.208
So we made a deal

15:40.292 --> 15:42.792
and everyone lived
happily ever after..

15:44.333 --> 15:46.000
...until the war.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.083
Then we all got kicked out.

15:53.125 --> 15:57.292
But now we're here
and we're gonna stay here

15:57.375 --> 16:00.542
and we are gonna
send a message.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.708
You got a problem with that?

16:04.292 --> 16:06.417
[music continues]

16:06.500 --> 16:08.792
Then let's get to work.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.708
Well, finally,
since we've opened up membership

16:11.792 --> 16:15.083
in the Anla'Shok to all
the other alliance races

16:15.167 --> 16:18.458
we've been joined by a few
recruits from the outworlds.

16:18.542 --> 16:22.542
Two Drazi
and a pair of Yolu

16:22.625 --> 16:25.333
three Abbai and a Pak'ma'ra.

16:25.417 --> 16:29.333
We have no idea what to do
with the Pak'ma'ra.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.708
They're slow, greedy,
selfish, not very bright.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.333
They refuse to speak anything
other than their own language

16:35.417 --> 16:37.292
so we have to use a translator.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.000
And they're carrion-eaters.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.542
'If it's not five days dead
and decayed'

16:42.625 --> 16:44.083
they won't touch it.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.625
We've had to move
the quarters of the Pak'ma'ra

16:46.708 --> 16:48.750
well away
from the other recruits.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.333
'It's the smell, you see.'

16:50.417 --> 16:53.125
'It's-it's quite astonishing.'

16:53.208 --> 16:55.958
I understand your desire
to make the rangers

16:56.042 --> 16:59.417
representative of all the
member races, Delenn, but, uh..

16:59.500 --> 17:02.083
...this may not be practical.

17:02.167 --> 17:05.250
The Anla'Shok is trained
to fight, to think.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.417
They have to learn
at least two other languages

17:07.500 --> 17:09.208
not counting interlac.

17:09.292 --> 17:11.583
So what are we to do
with the Pak'ma'ra?

17:14.958 --> 17:17.917
Our training methods
were created by Minbari

17:18.000 --> 17:19.625
to serve Minbari.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.125
But if there is any lesson
to be learned from the humans

17:23.208 --> 17:25.958
it is that we are made stronger
by our differences

17:26.042 --> 17:27.583
not weaker.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.583
If the Pak'ma'ra
cannot learn to be

17:29.667 --> 17:31.208
what we think they should be

17:31.292 --> 17:34.125
then perhaps we should learn
to use them for what they are.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.292
[scoffs]
Well, we've already considered
using them

17:37.375 --> 17:39.292
for garbage disposal.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.792
But there are some things
that even a Pak'ma'ra won't eat.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.375
- We think.
- We think, yes.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.125
We haven't actually discovered
what that is yet.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.125
The interesting thing
about the Pak'ma'ra

17:49.208 --> 17:50.500
is that they're everywhere.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.125
They limp from planet to planet

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
bartering their supplies
of quantium 40

17:54.708 --> 17:56.625
which everyone needs
for jumpgate production.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.000
We see them every day

17:58.083 --> 17:59.542
but no one wants
anything to do with them.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.375
Well, can you blame them?

18:01.458 --> 18:03.042
You miss the point.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.542
For all intents and purposes,
the Pak'ma'ra are invisible.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.958
Ignored, shunned.

18:08.042 --> 18:11.375
People go to great lengths
not to notice them.

18:11.458 --> 18:15.458
Can you think of a race better
suited to work as couriers?

18:15.542 --> 18:19.458
Bringing reports too important
to risk on an open channel?

18:19.542 --> 18:22.667
She's right. The rangers are
needed on the frontier.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.667
They shouldn't be used
as couriers

18:24.750 --> 18:27.125
which is just as dangerous.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.917
The Pak'ma'ra
won't even be noticed.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.500
Well, I suppose there's
a certain rough wisdom there.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.833
I'll start the training sessions
in infiltration

18:38.917 --> 18:42.167
and message coding
when we get back.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.542
- Thank you, Entil'Zha.
- You're welcome.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.292
We'll continue this again
when you've had a chance to rest

18:53.375 --> 18:54.667
from your long trip.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.042
It's good to see you, Turval.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.833
It's been too long.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.125
I've heard about Marcus,
and I'm sorry.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.708
He was one
of my better pupils

19:08.792 --> 19:12.667
uh, once I got through the noise
which he filled his head.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.375
It was unfortunate
but not unexpected.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.708
Why do you say that?

19:17.792 --> 19:20.875
He joined the Anla'Shok
for the wrong reasons

19:20.958 --> 19:24.042
because of guilt over
the death of his brother.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.250
'He wasn't looking
for a way to serve.'

19:26.333 --> 19:28.750
He was seeking a way
to atone..

19:28.833 --> 19:31.875
...which, uh, brings me
to someone else.

19:31.958 --> 19:34.125
I won't need you
any further.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.917
You're free to explore
the station.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.958
Once you complete your training
you will be here frequently.

19:40.042 --> 19:43.708
So, uh, may as well get
acquainted now as later.

19:48.167 --> 19:53.417
I'm very much concerned
about your aide Lennier.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.083
He's training much harder
than he should.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.250
He's taking on too much
pushing himself

19:58.333 --> 20:00.750
to the limit
in combat training.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.583
Sometimes he's reckless.

20:02.667 --> 20:06.708
I, I wonder if he is trying
to prove something.

20:06.792 --> 20:11.667
Maybe to me,
maybe to himself or..

20:11.750 --> 20:13.875
...maybe to someone else?

20:16.833 --> 20:19.458
Let us say only that, um..

20:19.542 --> 20:21.333
...I'm also concerned.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.958
Watch him for me, Turval.

20:25.042 --> 20:28.292
If he continues on this way,
let me know.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.958
Of course.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.917
And if you should ever need
somebody to talk to, Delenn

20:33.000 --> 20:37.417
I hope you'll remember your
old teacher from time to time.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.125
I will.
Thank you, Turval.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.542
(Garibaldi)
'And so my intent
is to use you sparingly'

20:47.625 --> 20:49.458
'only when there's no other way
to gather information'

20:49.542 --> 20:51.458
'critical to saving lives.'

20:51.542 --> 20:53.167
Seems like every time
you use a telepath

20:53.250 --> 20:54.833
in an intelligence
gathering capacity

20:54.917 --> 20:58.000
well, it's an interstellar
incident just waiting to happen.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.500
I figure on creating
several teams

20:59.583 --> 21:01.500
which will maximize flexibility
and guarantee that

21:01.583 --> 21:03.500
none of you gets used
any more than you should.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.167
I know this kind of work
is a strain

21:05.250 --> 21:08.083
and I don't want anyone
to feel overburdened.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.542
'Any questions?'

21:12.250 --> 21:14.750
Alright, Zack here will
see to it that you get

21:14.833 --> 21:16.500
special com links
by the end of the week.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.667
And only he and I will
have the ID numbers.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.792
Then..

21:21.875 --> 21:25.125
...then we see what happens.
That's all.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.833
Oh, uh, next time..

21:31.917 --> 21:35.292
...try to contain your
enthusiasm for the job. Hmm?

21:40.667 --> 21:43.542
Argh! You sure
this is a good idea?

21:43.625 --> 21:45.292
I'll let you know
if I survive it.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.208
- Hey, listen, need a favor.
- Shoot.

21:47.292 --> 21:49.667
I need you to pull the security
jacket on Captain Lochley.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.125
- See what's inside.
- Are you nuts?

21:51.208 --> 21:53.583
That information is personal
and classified.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.625
And? Look, I did the same thing
when Sheridan came on board.

21:56.708 --> 21:57.708
I just think it's a good idea

21:57.792 --> 21:59.375
that we know
who we're dealing with.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.208
You've really got a bug up
your butt about her, don't you?

22:02.292 --> 22:03.583
I mean, did it ever
occur to you that

22:03.667 --> 22:05.250
just because
somebody doesn't agree with you

22:05.333 --> 22:07.458
that doesn't mean
they're the enemy?

22:08.042 --> 22:09.458
No.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.542
Look, there's something that
she's not telling us, Zack.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.708
Like why would Sheridan hire
somebody who's on the wrong side

22:13.792 --> 22:15.125
of the war to run this place?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.417
Alright, fine,
the rumor back home

22:16.500 --> 22:17.625
is that
he's trying to make peace.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.333
Now, that may be true,
as far as it goes

22:19.417 --> 22:21.292
but I smell something else
going on here.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.042
How does he know he can even
trust her? He barely..

22:23.125 --> 22:25.542
[beeps]
Zack Allan, go.

22:25.625 --> 22:27.417
(man #2 on speaker)
'Chief, we just
received a babcom message'

22:27.500 --> 22:28.750
'from someone who says
she knows'

22:28.833 --> 22:30.417
'who's behind the murders
in Downbelow.'

22:30.500 --> 22:32.417
- You got an ID?
- 'Yeah.'

22:32.500 --> 22:34.667
(man #2 on speaker)
'A Cynthia Teegarden,
brown 42 C.'

22:34.750 --> 22:36.750
'We ran a check on her.
She's pretty clean.'

22:36.833 --> 22:38.625
'Says she wants to talk to you
but she doesn't want'

22:38.708 --> 22:41.458
'anyone to know that she's
the one who gave you the tip.'

22:41.542 --> 22:44.167
Alright, tell her I'll meet her
in the access way to brown six.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.208
It's pretty deserted
this time of day.

22:46.292 --> 22:49.583
Security out.
Got to go.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.458
- What about my..
- I'll think about it.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.583
[dramatic music]

22:56.750 --> 22:57.917
Hmm.

23:00.042 --> 23:03.125
This may not be a good idea.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.292
We should learn about
all the dark places here

23:05.375 --> 23:07.792
since that is where
we will do our work..

23:08.875 --> 23:10.792
...in the dark.

23:21.375 --> 23:23.208
Hey. You sent the message?

23:23.292 --> 23:24.958
Yeah. Yeah, I sent it.

23:25.042 --> 23:26.417
He'll be here
in a few minutes.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.792
Good. Alright, we got to find--

23:27.875 --> 23:29.458
Wait, you promised me.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.708
You promised me money
for a ticket home.

23:31.792 --> 23:34.083
I've been stuck here so long
and you promised me.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.458
Here. There you go.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.375
Transport leaves
in 30 minutes. Beat it.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.958
Now, we got to find a place
to leave the body

23:40.042 --> 23:42.333
where it's gonna be seen
for a while this time.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.667
- I got a place.
- What body?

23:44.750 --> 23:46.500
It's none of your business.
Beat it.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.708
Wait, you-you said you were just

23:47.792 --> 23:49.167
gonna scare him
into leaving you alone.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.333
You didn't say anything
about killing anyone.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.417
They've got my name
on file.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.875
All the more reason for you
to leave then, isn't it?

23:55.958 --> 23:59.125
- Bye-bye.
- No. I can't.

23:59.208 --> 24:01.417
I can't go along
with this.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.833
No! Let me go! No!

24:07.833 --> 24:09.083
Where are you going?

24:09.167 --> 24:10.167
Someone's in trouble.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.375
[Cynthia screams]

24:11.458 --> 24:13.875
It's not our problem.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.375
You don't know who it is
or what's going on.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.417
It could be anything.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.458
(Cynthia)
'Let me go!'

24:18.542 --> 24:21.333
- It doesn't matter.
- It does!

24:21.417 --> 24:23.667
We shouldn't get involved
in things like this.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.542
They will only compromise
our mission.

24:25.625 --> 24:29.208
Our mission is to save life.
Now, let go.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.542
No. Stop! Let me go!

24:40.417 --> 24:42.417
You had your chance.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.542
No.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.625
[zapping]

24:45.708 --> 24:48.167
[intense music]

24:48.250 --> 24:49.958
[man grunts]

24:53.000 --> 24:54.292
[grunts]

24:54.375 --> 24:56.042
[groans]

25:02.167 --> 25:03.333
He's a ranger.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.333
Yeah, I've heard about 'em.

25:05.417 --> 25:08.167
Some kind of
police force, right?

25:08.250 --> 25:11.417
Well, we wanted to make
a statement to the authorities.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.083
Might as well make one
with him as anyone else.

25:14.167 --> 25:16.208
[groaning]

25:23.833 --> 25:26.500
[intense music]

25:39.000 --> 25:40.250
In Valen's name.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.750
- How badly is he hurt?
- Bad.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.375
If he were human,
he'd be dead right now.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.667
The woman he saved
called security.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.333
They got there as fast
as they could

25:50.417 --> 25:54.542
but the ones who did this
heard them coming and escaped.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.625
'I should have gone with him.'

25:57.708 --> 25:59.208
Where is she now?

26:00.333 --> 26:01.625
Zack thinks she may have
gotten aboard

26:01.708 --> 26:03.125
a transport
to one of the outer sectors.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.625
We just don't know which one.

26:04.708 --> 26:07.167
Did he say anything
before he lost consciousness?

26:07.250 --> 26:08.542
Just that his attackers
were human

26:08.625 --> 26:10.375
and that they were
making a statement

26:10.458 --> 26:12.750
about who runs things
around here.

26:12.833 --> 26:14.083
'Zack's checking things
on his end'

26:14.167 --> 26:15.750
'but, uh, there's
not much to go on.'

26:15.833 --> 26:17.708
See to it he lives, doctor.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.750
Make him well enough to stand.

26:19.833 --> 26:21.958
We will do the rest.

26:22.042 --> 26:23.667
Mora'dum.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.500
"Mora'dum?"

26:35.583 --> 26:37.917
It refers to a part
of ranger training.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.250
It means..

26:41.333 --> 26:43.417
"The Application of Terror."

26:50.000 --> 26:51.583
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Delenn.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.333
It's been one of those days.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.583
I, uh, heard about your friend.
I'm sorry.

26:55.667 --> 26:56.875
How is he?

26:56.958 --> 26:58.833
He regained consciousness
during the night

26:58.917 --> 27:01.000
but he is still
very badly injured.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.750
Then we can get
a statement. Good.

27:02.833 --> 27:04.042
I'll have Zack
talk to him

27:04.125 --> 27:06.000
find out the description
of his attacker--

27:06.083 --> 27:08.792
I'm afraid that will
not be possible.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.042
Well, if he, uh,
can't remember the details

27:11.125 --> 27:13.125
we can have a telepath
jog his memory, or--

27:13.208 --> 27:15.375
No, we have the information

27:15.458 --> 27:17.667
but we will attend to it
ourselves.

27:17.750 --> 27:20.083
This matter is now officially
under the jurisdiction

27:20.167 --> 27:21.500
of the Anla'Shok.

27:21.583 --> 27:24.250
Rangers are required to deal
with such things themselves.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.375
Without resorting
to outside intervention.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.083
Delenn, this is a, this is
a matter of internal security.

27:29.167 --> 27:32.542
I would hardly refer to it
as "outside intervention."

27:33.708 --> 27:35.958
'Look, I know that
you have certain'

27:36.042 --> 27:37.875
cultural imperatives
going on here.

27:37.958 --> 27:40.042
I don't understand them
and I won't pretend that I do

27:40.125 --> 27:42.875
but I can't have a bunch
of vigilantes

27:42.958 --> 27:44.458
running around my station.

27:44.542 --> 27:48.042
Captain, all members of
the alliance, including Earth

27:48.125 --> 27:51.333
have recognized the independent
authority of the rangers.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.417
Under the new constitution,
the Anla'Shok

27:53.500 --> 27:57.667
are above local security and
police forces, yours included.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.167
You're pulling rank.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.792
I wouldn't wish to put it
in quite those terms but--

28:01.875 --> 28:04.292
No, no, I don't suppose
that you would.

28:04.375 --> 28:05.667
I assume that you don't mind

28:05.750 --> 28:08.000
if I ask
the president his opinion.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.500
We have already spoken.
He supports this.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.875
I can't believe it.
It-it's not like him.

28:15.333 --> 28:19.958
It's...it's not like him?
How?

28:20.042 --> 28:23.500
Delenn, you can't just run
around having the rangers

28:23.583 --> 28:25.708
take out your revenge
every time somebody gets hurt.

28:25.792 --> 28:29.792
Captain, this is not
about revenge.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.625
Oh? What is it about?

28:33.708 --> 28:35.125
Terror.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.792
How is he?

28:46.875 --> 28:48.875
He spoke a little while ago.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.667
He asked for water.

28:50.750 --> 28:53.417
I gave it to him and then
he fell asleep again.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.333
It's the body's way
of healing itself.

28:57.750 --> 29:01.292
I wonder, though, what it
would take to heal you.

29:02.750 --> 29:05.000
I was not injured,
Sech Turval.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.083
No, not physically.

29:07.167 --> 29:09.333
But your spirit is wounded.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.875
I abandoned him.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.292
I should never
have let him go alone.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.833
But you did.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.042
- Yes.
- Why?

29:24.500 --> 29:27.292
There's no shame
in the truth, Rastenn.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.000
I was afraid.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.000
Of dying?

29:33.083 --> 29:35.208
No.

29:35.292 --> 29:37.667
I didn't know
what was involved.

29:37.750 --> 29:41.083
It could have been something
foolish or trivial or stupid.

29:41.167 --> 29:44.083
If I am asked to lay down
my life for my people

29:44.167 --> 29:47.167
for my friends,
I would do so in an instant

29:47.250 --> 29:48.417
but I-I felt that--

29:48.500 --> 29:51.667
You were afraid of dying
without reason.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.083
Yes.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.375
Death in a cause is one thing

29:55.458 --> 29:58.042
but death without meaning..

29:58.125 --> 30:00.167
If I told you
to climb a mountain

30:00.250 --> 30:03.542
and bring me a flower
from the highest point

30:03.625 --> 30:06.875
and you would die after
completing your task

30:06.958 --> 30:09.500
would that be meaningless?

30:09.583 --> 30:12.417
Of course.
It's trivial.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.917
And if there
are a million people

30:15.000 --> 30:17.542
waiting at the base
of that mountain

30:17.625 --> 30:22.125
to whom that one flower
was a symbol of their freedom

30:22.208 --> 30:24.833
and they would follow
that symbol and your death

30:24.917 --> 30:30.167
into a struggle that would
liberate half a billion souls

30:30.250 --> 30:32.125
would that
have a meaning?

30:35.083 --> 30:38.208
'You see? We create
the meaning in our lives.'

30:38.292 --> 30:40.708
It does not exist
independently.

30:40.792 --> 30:43.583
Being Anla'Shok
does not mean worrying

30:43.667 --> 30:46.125
about what others
will think about us.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.750
It does not mean
deciding what to do

30:48.833 --> 30:50.167
based upon whether or not

30:50.250 --> 30:53.333
it serves our sense of ego
or destiny.

30:53.417 --> 30:57.750
It means living each moment
as if it were your last one.

30:57.833 --> 31:01.333
It means doing each right thing
because it is the right thing.

31:01.417 --> 31:02.583
The scale doesn't matter.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.750
The where, the when,
the how or in what cause

31:05.833 --> 31:08.333
none of those things matter.

31:08.417 --> 31:12.750
In my life, I've discovered
very few truths.

31:14.167 --> 31:18.292
Here is the greatest truth
I know..

31:18.375 --> 31:21.875
...your death, Rastenn,
will have a meaning

31:21.958 --> 31:26.208
if it comes while you're in
fullest pursuit of your heart.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.917
[instrumental music]

31:40.792 --> 31:43.833
- Finished?
- Finished.

31:43.917 --> 31:48.375
We've helped him face
his terror in a quieter battle.

31:48.458 --> 31:52.958
And now we must try to help him
in the same way.

31:55.667 --> 31:59.292
(Elizabeth)
So what kind of terror are
we talking about here, Delenn?

31:59.375 --> 32:02.208
(Delenn)
The kind that cripples.

32:02.292 --> 32:05.125
The kind that destroys.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.917
Not from without..

32:07.000 --> 32:08.500
...but from within.

32:09.708 --> 32:11.042
As soon as he can stand

32:11.125 --> 32:13.417
whether he is fully
healed or not

32:13.500 --> 32:17.542
Tannier will prepare
to face his terror.

32:17.625 --> 32:21.625
Those who harm him
now have power over him.

32:21.708 --> 32:24.083
He must take back that power

32:24.167 --> 32:27.333
or he will
never be whole again.

32:27.417 --> 32:32.000
We will go with him and bring
him to the point of his terror

32:32.083 --> 32:34.750
and then he will face it.

32:34.833 --> 32:38.208
(Elizabeth)
But if he isn't fully healed
he could die in the effort.

32:38.292 --> 32:42.417
(Delenn)
As Anla'Shok, we choose to do
that which frightens us

32:42.500 --> 32:45.375
knowing that
there are no guarantees.

32:45.458 --> 32:48.917
He may lose.
We cannot help him.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.458
(Elizabeth)
Then he will stand alone.

32:51.542 --> 32:53.542
(Delenn)
At the end, captain..

32:53.625 --> 32:55.750
...we all stand alone.

32:59.833 --> 33:02.083
Alright, that's it.
Come on! Everybody out.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.708
Let's go. Come on.

33:04.792 --> 33:07.375
I don't get it.
Why do we have to leave?

33:07.458 --> 33:09.083
'Cause Delenn
told the president

33:09.167 --> 33:10.417
the president
told the captain

33:10.500 --> 33:12.708
the captain told me,
and I'm telling you.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.417
They want this whole area
cleared of security personnel.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.333
What do we do
if something happens?

33:17.417 --> 33:19.542
Nothin'. Those are my orders.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.250
Now, come on.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.500
Trace, man, you've been outside?

33:24.583 --> 33:25.750
Un-hm. Why?

33:25.833 --> 33:27.083
Everybody in security
just took a hike, man.

33:27.167 --> 33:28.792
I went up two levels,
down one.

33:28.875 --> 33:30.333
We're clear
in both directions.

33:30.417 --> 33:32.583
We've got the whole place
to ourselves.

33:32.667 --> 33:34.167
You see?
What did I tell ya?

33:34.250 --> 33:37.042
You just gotta be strong,
show 'em you mean business

33:37.125 --> 33:40.583
and you get to do
whatever you want to do.

33:40.667 --> 33:42.083
What the hell is that?

33:42.167 --> 33:44.125
[automated message]
'Emergency lights activated'.

33:44.208 --> 33:47.583
Red, Jerry, go on outside,
check it out.

33:47.667 --> 33:50.500
Take a hand-mike,
and you stay in touch!

33:52.083 --> 33:55.125
[dramatic music]

34:05.208 --> 34:07.792

'I can't see a damned thing.'

'We.. Unh! No! Aah!'

Jerry?

34:14.375 --> 34:16.583
- Jerry, you there?
- What happened?

34:16.667 --> 34:19.000
I don't know
...but whatever it is

34:19.083 --> 34:21.625
I bet it's just
these three levels.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.500
We get topside,
we'll be okay.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.833
Listen up, everyone.
We're gettin' outta here.

34:25.917 --> 34:27.083
You three, take point.

34:27.167 --> 34:29.208
The rest of you,
bring up the rear. Let's go!

34:30.875 --> 34:33.917
[music continues]

34:44.375 --> 34:46.417
[screams]

34:46.500 --> 34:47.750
Miller!

34:48.833 --> 34:50.292
Man, he's gone!

34:50.375 --> 34:52.833
[man screaming]

34:59.458 --> 35:00.750
[grunts]
Hey!

35:01.917 --> 35:03.667
Who do you think you are?

35:03.750 --> 35:06.375
Who do you think
you're playing with, huh?

35:09.417 --> 35:11.083
Who are you?

35:11.167 --> 35:12.958
- 'Where's Trace?'
- 'Stay together!'

35:13.958 --> 35:15.333
[clanks]

35:15.417 --> 35:17.292
[all shouting]

35:17.375 --> 35:18.500
[groans]

35:19.167 --> 35:22.208
[grunting]

35:26.417 --> 35:27.833
[grunts]

35:34.500 --> 35:37.583
[music continues]

35:51.917 --> 35:54.833
[gasps]
What do you want from me?

35:56.458 --> 35:57.792
Why are you doing this?

35:59.083 --> 36:01.583
You stay away from me.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.500
'You understand?
You stay away from me.'

36:03.583 --> 36:06.375
[music continues]

36:08.625 --> 36:11.708
[breathing heavily]

36:19.167 --> 36:22.417
Oh, no.
Not a chance.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.125
I'm not fighting
all of you.

36:24.208 --> 36:26.625
Not all of us.
Just him.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.417
Well, that's too bad.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.833
'Cause I'm not trained
to use one of these things.

36:31.917 --> 36:34.750
His training
was not complete, either.

36:34.833 --> 36:37.167
It didn't stop you before.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.000
Don't let it stop you now.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.917
(Durhan)
'If you want to leave here,
the way is past him.'

36:42.000 --> 36:44.208
None of us
will move to stop you

36:44.292 --> 36:47.250
you can get past him.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.250
Not a chance.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.250
I've got my rights.
I've got my rights!

36:53.333 --> 36:54.833
[groans]

36:57.708 --> 37:01.208
You've got the pike.
Continue.

37:01.292 --> 37:03.083
[grunting]

37:04.792 --> 37:06.375
Attend, students

37:06.458 --> 37:09.625
this is a classic
archetype in action.

37:09.708 --> 37:14.250
The strong man or bully
as the humans call it

37:14.333 --> 37:17.458
essentially a coward
whose only skill

37:17.542 --> 37:22.208
is convincing others to do
what he's afraid to do himself.

37:29.708 --> 37:30.958
Notice the lack of technique

37:31.042 --> 37:32.583
no follow through.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.958
Another flaw in this
particular personality type..

37:36.042 --> 37:38.333
...all muscle, no brain.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.208
This isn't fair!

37:40.292 --> 37:42.042
I don't know how to use
this damn thing!

37:42.125 --> 37:45.167
Inexperience is not an issue.

37:45.250 --> 37:48.333
Any one of you showed far more
technique and potential

37:48.417 --> 37:50.417
the first time
you held a pike

37:50.500 --> 37:52.375
even the Pak'ma'ra.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.125
[laughing]

37:58.542 --> 38:01.542
[grunting]

38:16.542 --> 38:18.833
[panting]

38:22.875 --> 38:25.250
Where is your fear now, Tannier?

38:27.292 --> 38:29.250
Gone, master.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.750
And what do you feel? Anger?

38:31.833 --> 38:33.917
Do you feel triumphant?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.125
Happiness, joy?

38:37.083 --> 38:40.125
- Pity.
- Why?

38:40.208 --> 38:42.875
Because this is all
he will ever have

38:42.958 --> 38:45.542
and all he will ever know..

38:45.625 --> 38:50.000
...because his name will
be swallowed by silence..

38:50.083 --> 38:51.625
...forgotten.

38:51.708 --> 38:55.417
His name belongs to no one.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.167
And who does your name
belong to? History?

38:59.250 --> 39:01.083
The world?

39:01.167 --> 39:04.542
No. It belongs to me.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.500
Here ends the lesson.

39:16.542 --> 39:18.458
You may take him now.

39:18.542 --> 39:21.625
[instrumental music]

39:30.167 --> 39:31.500
(man #3 on speaker)
'Shuttle Newton,
you are cleared for launch.'

39:31.583 --> 39:33.292
You should come
with us, Delenn.

39:33.375 --> 39:35.125
It is not right
for the Entil'Zha

39:35.208 --> 39:37.833
to be so far from home
for so long.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.542
The rangers could profit
by your influence.

39:40.625 --> 39:43.708
I wish I could, Turval,
but I'm needed here

39:43.792 --> 39:45.917
to begin the process of
setting up training camps

39:46.000 --> 39:48.125
in other alliance worlds.

39:48.208 --> 39:50.000
Sheridan and I
will be there soon enough

39:50.083 --> 39:53.292
and when that happens,
I was thinking

39:53.375 --> 39:55.625
that I would like
to have Tannier

39:55.708 --> 39:58.125
assigned as one
of the house guards.

39:58.208 --> 40:01.167
Well, that is a great honor
for one so young.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.083
Yes, it is.

40:03.167 --> 40:07.000
Well, I will speak to you
when you get back home.

40:07.083 --> 40:09.292
Safe passage, Sech Durhan.

40:10.167 --> 40:12.042
Sech Turval.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.375
(both)
Entil'Zha, veni.

40:16.542 --> 40:20.000
Durhan...one thing.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.375
Turval told me
that the new recruits

40:22.458 --> 40:25.750
had not been fully trained
with the Denn-bok.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.667
The fighting pike is
a dangerous weapon, Delenn

40:28.750 --> 40:32.250
not to be taken lightly
or learned prematurely.

40:32.333 --> 40:33.833
Yes, I know.

40:33.917 --> 40:35.708
That's why it is proper
for recruits

40:35.792 --> 40:38.292
to learn from one
of the younger teachers.

40:38.375 --> 40:41.417
Only a very few will learn
from Durhan himself.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.875
Tannier handled the pike
quite well

40:44.958 --> 40:49.917
almost as though instructed by a
master before going into battle.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.500
Yes, he did.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.167
[chuckles]

40:55.250 --> 40:58.125
- Good day, Delenn.
- Durhan.

41:04.458 --> 41:05.625
[chuckles]

41:07.667 --> 41:09.250
(Garibaldi)
'You know, that's something
I never realized'

41:09.333 --> 41:10.250
about the Minbari.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.042
(Zack)
'What's that?'

41:12.125 --> 41:13.500
I think they're
genetically incapable

41:13.583 --> 41:17.167
of walking away from a fight.
No, I mean it.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.917
When Delenn's forces
went up against the Drakh

41:19.000 --> 41:20.708
they barely got out
with their skins intact.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.500
Yet they went back
and wiped them out anyway.

41:23.583 --> 41:25.542
Yeah, well, they killed
a bunch of her people.

41:25.625 --> 41:27.125
I know.
That's what I mean.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.333
You or me, we probably would
have gotten reinforcements

41:29.417 --> 41:31.542
and then got back
...but once they're in

41:31.625 --> 41:33.458
phew, they're in.

41:33.542 --> 41:34.917
Earth-Minbari War, same thing.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.542
We hit them,
they couldn't let go

41:36.625 --> 41:39.792
until either they beat us
or we beat them. Now this.

41:39.875 --> 41:42.333
'Somebody starts a fight,
and they gotta finish it.'

41:42.417 --> 41:44.292
Doesn't matter if they win
or lose, live or die.

41:44.375 --> 41:46.208
As long as they don't
give into the terror.

41:46.292 --> 41:48.083
Well, maybe..

41:48.167 --> 41:50.292
...and maybe that
ain't such a bad thing.

41:52.375 --> 41:53.958
So..

41:54.042 --> 41:56.750
...you, uh, got
the captain's file there?

41:56.833 --> 41:58.500
No. Go away.

41:58.583 --> 41:59.792
I could just peek..

41:59.875 --> 42:01.208
You know, Michael

42:01.292 --> 42:02.750
you and the Minbari
have one thing in common.

42:02.833 --> 42:05.500
You never know when to leave
something alone.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.042
[sighs]

42:12.042 --> 42:15.083
[dramatic music]

42:18.667 --> 42:20.083
[beeps]

42:20.167 --> 42:22.750
I'll be in in a minute, Delenn.

42:22.833 --> 42:26.458
That's fine.
I'm just thinking.

42:26.542 --> 42:29.458
Oh? About what?

42:29.542 --> 42:31.875
I spoke to
the captain today.

42:31.958 --> 42:34.250
At one point, she said
she couldn't believe

42:34.333 --> 42:37.458
that you would authorize
Mora'dum.

42:37.542 --> 42:40.625
She said it's not like you.

42:41.708 --> 42:44.042
What did she mean by that, John?

42:51.250 --> 42:53.458
I'm going to pretend
that you were going to tell me

42:53.542 --> 42:55.167
this sooner or later.

42:57.917 --> 42:59.250
I was just..

43:01.542 --> 43:03.292
...looking for the right time.

43:03.375 --> 43:06.708
Ten seconds after you thought
of it would have been good.

43:06.792 --> 43:07.958
'Yeah.'

43:08.917 --> 43:10.708
Yeah, maybe so.

43:18.375 --> 43:20.000
Are you alright?

43:20.917 --> 43:22.583
I think so.

43:24.042 --> 43:26.250
It will just..

43:26.333 --> 43:28.417
...take some
getting used to.

43:46.583 --> 43:49.000
[theme music]

44:18.292 --> 44:20.625
[theme music]
