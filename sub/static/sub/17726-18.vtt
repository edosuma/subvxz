- I had one experience on
a vacation trying to be single.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.110
I was like, "This is
what I have coming for me?"

00:09.143 --> 00:10.211
- Are you still thinking
that you want to do

00:11.279 --> 00:13.147
a Sur photo shoot this year?
- Don't worry.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.249
Go patch things up
with Schwartzy.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.318
- You were a nightmare of
a human being for the first two

00:17.351 --> 00:19.120
to three years I dated you.
- You know what, Tom?

00:19.153 --> 00:19.920
You had an option back then.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.155
- I know.
- And you put a ring on

00:21.189 --> 00:22.123
my f---ing finger,

00:23.057 --> 00:23.524
so stop throwing it in my
f----ing face.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.127
- No more fighting.
We'll bottle that sh-- up,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.263
all right?
I'm just not gonna fight.

I didn't steal anything,
so that's a win-win.

a great time, huh?

- I mean, just to be blunt,
there was a lot of arguing.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.144
- There was.
- For the first two nights

01:50.178 --> 01:51.912
they didn't even sleep
in the same bed.

- Yeah.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.616

the trip?

- I would say about 85%

01:57.318 --> 01:59.553
of the time.

making a mistake.

Go back.
Clean that mirror.

Do that. Do what you're
supposed to be doing,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.370

in your pockets.

Speaking of New Orleans,

two weeks before the wedding.

- Yeah. Tom and Katie
bottling their problems up

02:45.766 --> 02:49.270

is not a good solution.

Why not start now?

02:50.438 --> 02:51.472
What's the harm in doing that?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.407
What if you wait
till after the wedding

02:53.441 --> 02:54.775
and then you uncork
that bottle,

02:54.808 --> 02:57.678

come back from that?

How do you fight like that

03:00.814 --> 03:03.284
and then retrain yourself
not to fight that way?

you're really happy.

a little bit.

The theme of this photo shoot
this year is indulgence.

have I heard,

03:57.305 --> 04:00.741
that all you did
at your bachelorette party

04:00.774 --> 04:02.710
is fight with Schwartzy?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.746
- No, all Schwartz did
at the bachelorette party

04:05.779 --> 04:07.448
was argue with people.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.849
- Oh, so you're passing
the blame.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.352
- There was flare-ups,
and Tom and I argued--

04:11.385 --> 04:12.686
- What have you got
to fight about now?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.456
- I don't even know.
- You could lose each other

04:15.489 --> 04:16.624
if you keep going the direction.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.492
- And I think that's why
it scared us.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.794
- It's a lot of work,
what lies ahead of you.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.063
- Like, two weeks from today
we will be married.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.432
- Two weeks from today
you're gonna start

04:24.465 --> 04:25.733
the rest of your life.
- Exactly.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.068
- But you have to delete
all that bullsh--

04:28.101 --> 04:29.603
from your life.
I'm starting to have

04:29.637 --> 04:31.772
a little bit of anxiety
about this situation.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.509
This seems to be something
more than pre-wedding jitters.

If they can't even get along
when they're on vacation,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.682
what hope do they have
for the future?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.084

if I have Gibson in my hand.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.430

a card in two days.

when I did my dating profile,

05:37.871 --> 05:38.906

05:38.939 --> 05:40.708
so I want to try
to make yours better.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.678
Am I really going on OK Cupid?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.781
- Don't knock online dating
until you try it.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.651
I met the love of my life
on a dating app.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.521
Be a little more
open-minded, bitch.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.723
- Okay,
"Write a little about yourself."

05:55.756 --> 05:58.626
- Brunch, dogs, w--wine, ranch.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.394
- Why don't I just write
basic bitch then?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.730
- That's who you are.
- Yeah.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.866
"Wine, brunch,

and ranch."

06:14.908 --> 06:15.909
How's that?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
I have not been
in the dating world

06:17.645 --> 06:18.746
for a very long time,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.648
much less dating apps.

desperate measures, you know?

Don't judge.

I'm submitting.

I am just
gonna be open to whatever.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.558
I mean, not exactly whatever.
No more bartenders,

so I'm not gonna be
open to bartenders.

So we're excited.
- Yes, it's near.

So what have you got left to do?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.527
You've got--you've done
the flowers.

the menu with them currently,

07:11.899 --> 07:13.867
and you've been helping.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.569
You've been assisting me--
[laughs]

07:15.603 --> 07:16.570
- Well, you know,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.606
I just want to steer you
in the right direction.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.941
- There is, like, one thing,

07:20.974 --> 07:22.643
like, left that we have to do.
- What?

like that,

07:31.819 --> 07:33.453
Hello.
- Good afternoon.

07:34.855 --> 07:35.956
Lisa Vanderpump,

07:35.989 --> 07:38.492
the fairest lady in the land,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.060
queen of Villa Rosa

07:40.093 --> 07:42.963
and magistrate
of Sur restaurant,

07:42.996 --> 07:45.666
it's with great respect
and honor

07:45.699 --> 07:48.902
that these lovers
bestow a request

07:48.936 --> 07:52.272
to ordain
their forthcoming nuptial

07:52.305 --> 07:55.576
and make it official.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.680
[both laughing]

07:59.713 --> 08:00.948
- Wow.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.654
I see this is a very funny
kind of experience

08:06.687 --> 08:08.622
that only these two
would arrange,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.057
but, like, really?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.525
Sit down.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.627
I'm totally overwhelmed
at this point.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.864
I mean, I really
didn't expect this.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.766
- Well, that was the point.
- Yeah.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.534
We wanted
to do something special

08:20.568 --> 08:22.870
because it means a lot
for you to do this for us.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.572
- Yeah.
- Not to put pressure on you.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.673
You don't have to say yes,

08:25.706 --> 08:28.008
but we would love it
if you would.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.944
- You know what
really worries me?

08:30.978 --> 08:33.681
For me to take
on this responsibility

08:33.714 --> 08:37.618
to ordain a marriage,

08:37.651 --> 08:40.954
I take marriage very seriously,
I mean, very seriously.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.790
- As do we.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.158
- But the way you've been
behaving lately

08:45.192 --> 08:48.762
has given me
great cause for concern.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.097
Hey, Katie. Everything okay?

08:50.130 --> 08:53.166
- Tom and I have had
a few little flare-ups.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.770
It's just hard sometimes when
I feel like he's not hearing me.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.772
- Well, what was the argument,
then, the other day?

08:58.806 --> 09:01.008
- Mostly probably just 'cause we
both had been, like, drinking.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.910
He ended up calling me a bitch.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.913
- You're getting married
in a few weeks, for God's sake.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.915
It was only two
or three days ago

09:07.948 --> 09:10.784
you were at
each other's throats.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.120
This has to be
a new chapter in your life.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.722
Do you understand?
both: Yeah.

09:14.755 --> 09:19.159
- So I'm concerned of
taking the responsibility.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.928
I just need to know that

09:20.961 --> 09:24.898
you're really committed
to each other.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.000
I think they need to ask
themselves at this point

09:27.034 --> 09:31.905
whether getting married
really is the right decision.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.707
- Like, the--like, all the sh--

09:33.741 --> 09:37.377
we've been through has
overshadowed the relationship.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.713
- What, darling?
- I'm just disappointed.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.948
- In me?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.983
- In myself and us.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.789
- It's okay, Bubby.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.826
We're just--we got
a little sloppy along the way.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.728
- Oh, you're making me cry.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.698
- We have problems,
and they're big.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.899
We are f---ed up.
We know that.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.834
We are the first ones
to admit that,

10:00.868 --> 10:02.703
and it's bad, and it's ugly,

10:02.736 --> 10:05.739
and that's something that we've
had to face all summer long.

10:05.773 --> 10:10.711
I feel like I've wasted so much
time just on stupid stuff.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.414
The reason why I feel this way
is because, like,

10:14.447 --> 10:17.951
how much I want
to be there with him

10:17.985 --> 10:19.687
and how much
I want us to rebuild

10:19.720 --> 10:22.690
and get back to that place.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.992
- Yeah.
- We are better than that,

10:25.025 --> 10:26.259
and we know that,

10:26.293 --> 10:30.731
and we let ourselves forget that
for a minute, for a long minute.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.735
- I can't say never,
but not now.

10:34.768 --> 10:38.138
I want to know that you're
really committed to each other.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.810
Coming up...

10:42.843 --> 10:46.013
- Do you know how,
like, important sleeping is?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.948
I'm, like, convinced

10:47.981 --> 10:49.950
that that's why I'm pretty.

10:53.887 --> 10:58.258
*

10:58.291 --> 11:00.761
[all chattering indistinctly]

11:00.794 --> 11:01.829
- Okay.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.399
- Do you want a drink?
- I'm okay.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.369
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.338
- You're like
a Malibu geisha over here.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.273
- [laughs]

11:13.306 --> 11:14.274
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.308
- Hey, guys.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.443
- Hey.
- What's up, guys?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.311
- Hey, Schwartz, will you rub
some lotion on my back?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.713
- Yeah, I got you, dude.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.781
- I'm kidding.
- Hi.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.750
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.484
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.154
- And Scheana's just gonna be
taking selfies the whole time.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.790
- It's just one Snapchat
to send to my husband

11:29.823 --> 11:32.192
'cause he can't be here.
- Whatever.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.861
- How was your date last night?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.462
- So, so, so, so good.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.230
- And have one tonight
with a different guy?

11:37.264 --> 11:38.031
- Yeah.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.466
I made out, like,
all night long.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.234
- Ooh.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.736
There's nothing like
a first kiss.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.804
- And it was, like,
a really good one.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.805
- Yeah.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.006
[inaudible] your first kiss.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.909
- I mean, I'm not looking
for anyone to put a ring on it,

11:48.942 --> 11:51.344
I mean, unless it's really big
and sparkly,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.813
in which case
you can put a ring on it.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.748
- I'm glad you didn't give it up
on the first date.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.483
I'm sure you, like, wanted to,
but it's kind of, like, better.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.351
- She's not you.
- I know.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.486
- [laughs]
- I know.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.155
- You guys are making me feel
so good about myself.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.123
- Can I get a refill?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.125
- I'll get you one.
- I need a refill too.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.860
- Hey, how did the thing
with Lisa go?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.429
- I wrote, like, a limerick,
like, a rhyme, a poem for Lisa-

12:09.462 --> 12:10.831
- Yeah.
- Proposing to her

12:10.864 --> 12:12.132
to ordain our wedding.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.300
- Oh, my God, I wish
I would have been there.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.501
Why didn't anyone Snapchat it?

12:14.534 --> 12:17.437
- It was--she was--well, she was
genuinely caught off guard.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.372
- Really?
- Yeah, such a great moment,

12:19.406 --> 12:20.473
and then we had a sit-down,

12:20.507 --> 12:23.143
and then it got,
like, really heavy.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.477
There wasn't, like, a yes.
She di--

12:24.511 --> 12:25.478
- What?
- Yeah.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.413
- Wait, what?
- What?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.381
- Yeah, I know, trust me.
- Wait, really?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.950
- Well.
- How do you not say yes?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.484
- She said to take
some time off,

12:31.518 --> 12:33.386
reaffirm your love
for one another,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.856
decide that you really do want
to follow through with this

12:35.889 --> 12:37.290
and that you do love each other.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.493
- And it was kind of, like,
a rock bottom for us.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.262
- And it's true.
Everything she's heard is true.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.531
We've been a f---ing disaster.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.367
- I know maybe at times we've
overstepped our boundaries,

12:47.400 --> 12:48.902
but I think it's all come from,

12:48.936 --> 12:50.871
like, a place of concern,
you know?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.239
- Of course.
- Well, I think it's safe

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
to say Lisa's the only one
that has the balls

12:54.241 --> 12:55.876
to say
what everyone was thinking.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.446
- I just feel so empty
right now, and I feel so guilty.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.781
- That she doesn't believe
in this marriage.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.989
- Look at the dolphins.
They came to feel the love.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.391
- I'm cold.
- I'm cold too.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.294
- Hold me.
- You hold me.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.896
I want to go be
a vegetable with you.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.497
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe eat some bad food.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.431
No, no, no, no bad food.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.333
- No bad food.
- We're getting in shape.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.568
No, I mean, you are in shape,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.871
but--I'm not saying you,
you know.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.506
This is dangerous territory

13:26.539 --> 13:28.508
'cause we said
we were gonna be unflappable.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.845
Then we were so flappable.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.480
Let's not be assholes anymore.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.848
- Mmm.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.452
You have something
in the corner of your mouth.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.287
Did you eat Doritos?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.590
- Yeah, I did.
- Yeah, oh, my God.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.258
- You should have
licked it off for me.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.359
- No.

13:46.393 --> 13:50.030
I would do anything for love,
but I won't do that.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.498
- We've been so close yet
so far away.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.634
- I know, no more.
- Was that cheesy? It's true.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.269
- No, it's true.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.271
- What is that, a rabbit's foot?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.373
- Don't touch it.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.409
What if it's, like,
a tampon or something?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.089
- Hey, handsome boy.
- Here he is.

14:16.123 --> 14:20.060
- I have this very
special man in my life.

14:20.093 --> 14:24.497
I need to introduce you
to my prince, Tardon.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.865
- Whoa, buddy.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.435
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.503
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.605
This is Carolin.
This is the love of my life.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.374
- Hi.
- Ariana, nice to meet you.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.508
- Hi, nice to meet you.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.310
Sorry, horse slobber.
- That's okay.

14:37.344 --> 14:42.315
Oh, my God, of course
Lisa has this bedazzled bridle,

14:42.349 --> 14:44.651
and I would trade my car
for that freaking helmet.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.553
- So you're gonna ride
this guy over here.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.655
- He's so beautiful.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.558
Everything about Lisa's life
is chic AF.

14:51.591 --> 14:56.930
I don't know that I could have
a bigger lady-crush on someone.

14:56.964 --> 15:00.133
- Let's do a little trot.
Good boy.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.601
Is he lovely?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.136
- Yeah, he's great.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.504
- [smooching]

15:04.537 --> 15:07.107
Come on, Ariana.
- Yeah, there we go.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.541
- Ken bought me my first horse.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.410
He just blew me away,

15:10.443 --> 15:12.612
and of course,
I returned the favor.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.950
To me, this is just, like,
a sanctuary out here.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.987
- Yeah, it's so nice.
- So is everything okay?

15:20.020 --> 15:24.057
- I talked to Schwartz.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.592
I know as of right now

15:25.625 --> 15:28.061
you're not thinking that you
would want to officiate,

15:28.095 --> 15:30.030
but when we were at the beach,
Katie said things

15:30.063 --> 15:31.564
I've never heard her say before,

15:31.598 --> 15:34.567
like that she felt really guilty

15:34.601 --> 15:37.037
and ashamed of
how she had acted

15:37.070 --> 15:38.538
and things
that she had said and--

15:38.571 --> 15:40.473
- You can't take the gloves off

15:40.507 --> 15:42.342
every time
you have a disagreement.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.145
I'm pleased to hear
that Tom and Katie

15:45.178 --> 15:47.680
have taken our talk
very seriously,

15:47.714 --> 15:48.681
but it's not that simple.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.184
They're gonna have to
really prove it to me.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.453
What about you?
Are you gonna marry him?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.722
- No.
- Huh?

15:55.755 --> 15:57.424
- I just don't--
I don't want kids,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.426
and so I don't really know--
I don't know.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.562
- How can you not want kids?
- I don't really like babies.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.064
I think they're kind of gross.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.698
- What do you mean?
They're--what?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.467
I bet you'll change your mind.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.369
Check back with me
in five years' time.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.371
I don't know,
maybe Ariana will come round

16:11.404 --> 16:13.773
to the idea of marriage
if she wants a little Sandoval.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.775
You know, she could change
his little diapers,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.510
shave his little baby forehead,

16:17.544 --> 16:19.046
put his little
pink extensions in.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.147
- No.
- But then,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.682
she probably does that already.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.051
Come on then.

16:35.795 --> 16:36.596
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.132
- Hey.
Do you want something to drink?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.668
- No, I want to do
this date sober.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.104
- Yes, please.
- This is the first time

16:44.137 --> 16:47.107
in seven years that I've been
actually, like, dating.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.209
I mean, I've gone from
relationship to relationship

16:49.242 --> 16:50.743
to relationship
to relationship,

16:50.777 --> 16:54.781
and now I'm going out on dates,
making out with dudes.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.185
Basically I'm, like,
a recovering serial monogamist.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.720
- Oh, cute.
- And if I did it with,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.589
like, maroon-y shoes,

17:02.622 --> 17:05.825
or I had an idea to do,
like, a tight black dress.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.794
- Wow, you'd be,
like, sexy, sassy.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.197
"I just tossed on this
little LBD, and--"

17:10.230 --> 17:12.565
- Yeah, I have three layers
of Spanx underneath, but--

17:12.599 --> 17:15.468
- Little LBD?
That's what you have on?

17:15.502 --> 17:16.336
You don't even have, like,
cute underwear on?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.071
- Mm-hmm.
I want to look skinny AF.

17:18.105 --> 17:21.541
- Just don't wear underwear.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.576
- No. Wait, what?

17:23.610 --> 17:25.112
- Well, what if you--what
if you really like him,

17:25.145 --> 17:26.813
and you guys start kissing,
and he, like, rubs,

17:26.846 --> 17:29.116
and he's like,
"Where do they st--oh,

17:29.149 --> 17:31.551
oh, they stop there?
To here--"

17:31.584 --> 17:33.720
- Kristen, you're
freaking me out right now.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.255
Dating is terrifying,

17:35.288 --> 17:38.125
but I'm embracing
my single lady-dom.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.692
I have a blind date

17:39.726 --> 17:41.194
that my friend Lauren
set up for me.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.562
I still don't know
anything about him.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.696
- What's his name?
- David.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.632
I did stalk him,
and he has, like,

17:45.665 --> 17:48.101
the best Instagram account
I've ever seen.

17:48.135 --> 17:51.671
It's all traveling photos,
not one gym selfie.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.706
I think we'll be okay.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.143
- A, do you have Adderall?
- I need to--

17:56.176 --> 17:58.478
- B, do you have Plan B,
and C, do you have condoms?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.480
Do you have, like, a little kit?
What if--what--

18:00.513 --> 18:02.482
- All right, we need--I think
we need to have a talk.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.251
Kristen, I don't need
to bring condoms

18:04.284 --> 18:07.220
because I'm not gonna
do anything on the first date.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.257
- You're so boring.
- I'm fully planning

18:10.290 --> 18:11.458
on going in there
and being like,

18:11.491 --> 18:14.594
"Listen, I didn't let you
pick me up because I don't know

18:14.627 --> 18:15.795
if you're gonna
murder me or not."

18:15.828 --> 18:19.566
- Can you save that for, like,
the second drink, though?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.901
Stassi needs to break down this,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.636
like, steel and concrete wall

18:23.670 --> 18:25.805
that she has up and just,
like, f--- around.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.575
She needs to put some effort in.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.776
- Yeah.
- [inaudible].

18:29.809 --> 18:31.911
- Oh, my God, you look really
s--you look really skinny.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.181
- That's hysterical
but really kind,

18:34.214 --> 18:35.348
so keep saying it.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.316
- Coming up...

18:36.349 --> 18:38.885
- Right leg forward,
left leg back. Perfect.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.653
- Oh, yeah, Peter,
stick that right leg.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.721
- Peter, get it
off there, Peter.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.623
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.262
*

18:49.296 --> 18:50.630
- All right, so who wants
to go first?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.332
- I'll lead by example.
- Okay.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.600
- Okay.
- He does--

18:53.633 --> 18:54.934
he's done this before.
- He's well-versed.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.436
He might even show you
a thing or two.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.637
- Yeah, he probably will.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.307
- I consider myself
a spray-tan aficionado.

19:00.340 --> 19:05.212
* I'm getting tan

19:05.245 --> 19:06.446
- The man I love.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.250
- I wanted to treat my friends
to a little spray-tan sesh.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.584
- Yeah, you didn't even have to
ask him to take his clothes off.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.420
He just did it.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.587
- We got a lot of things
coming up.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.290
We got the Sur photo shoot.
We got Schwartz's wedding.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.658
We're gonna be taking
a lot of pictures,

19:18.691 --> 19:20.460
and it's nice to have
a little color.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
- Okay, I'm not doing that.
That looks terrible.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.930
Now that I've seen
Tom go ahead of me

19:23.963 --> 19:26.633
and I've seen the stuff sprayed
all over my f---ing apartment,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.268
I really don't want this sh--
on me.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.669
- And now-
- Tai chi?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.970
- I am tanned and gorgeous.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.373
- Just really not in the market

19:33.406 --> 19:35.242
to look like an Oompa-Loompa.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.075
- You gonna do it? Do it.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.244
- No, I would have,
but I realized

19:37.277 --> 19:38.378
I stayed outside

19:38.411 --> 19:39.346
for the last couple days,
and I already got tanned.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.249
- Right leg forward,
left leg back. Perfect.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.350
- Oh, yeah, Peter,
stick that right leg.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.584
- Peter, get it
out there, Peter.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.353
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.754
- Go ahead and turn
your back to me.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.423
- Dude, pull your underwear down
a little bit.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.758
- He wears saggy underwear.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.493
- Schwartz, you should
go fully nude.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.462
That way, like,
when you get naked tonight

19:55.495 --> 19:56.663
when you and Katie bang,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.365
you won't have, like,
a boxer line.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.832
- No, she does--you guys
don't do that.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.301
- We did--like,
we did last night.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.269
- What?
- Yeah, we did.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.771
Katie and I had a lot of sex
in the beginning

20:04.804 --> 20:07.740
and then sort of, you know,
tapered off.

20:09.809 --> 20:13.012
- What the hell?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.481
- [laughs]
No, come on,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.249
I'm blowing
it up as, like, a gag.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.450
- I'm glad I didn't come in
and have your,

20:17.484 --> 20:19.786
like, pants around your ankles
while you were doing that.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.289
- But now, you know, we had sex,

20:22.322 --> 20:23.690
and it was, like,
the best sex ever.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
- Mission accomplished.
- All right, bye, guys.

20:25.758 --> 20:29.329
- Bye.
- Can I sit on the couch, Jax?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.563
- Yeah, just don't
lean back on it.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.564
This is a really
expensive couch.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.399
- Yeah, no, I'm like this.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.467
- So please--this is
a $5,000 couch.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.435
- Which one of you assholes

20:35.468 --> 20:37.337
is getting ordained in case
Lisa says no,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.038
she's not gonna f---ing
do the wedding?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.574
I can't have Jax ordain
my f---ing wedding.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.875
- Yeah.
- I love Jax so much,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.477
but, like, come on.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.846
Having him officiate
our wedding?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.381
It's like--I don't know,
it's like having

20:48.415 --> 20:50.717
Lucifer baptize you, you know?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.851
It's just not right.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.054
Do I want Jax to have
to f---ing ordain my wedding?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.490
- I could write some nice sh--.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.691
- Important question:

20:58.725 --> 21:00.593
how great do you guys feel

21:00.627 --> 21:02.061
now that you're
a little bit more tan?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.063
- I feel 20% more gorgeous.

21:04.096 --> 21:11.338
*

21:13.740 --> 21:15.375
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.344
- I'm David.
- Stassi, nice to meet you.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.512
- Nice to meet you.
You look beautiful.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.547
- Thank you very much.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.383
Going on a blind date
is so weird.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.084
Seriously, it's like
you're sitting down

21:25.117 --> 21:30.323
and interviewing someone
so that both of you can evaluate

21:30.357 --> 21:32.525
whether you eventually

21:32.559 --> 21:34.827
want to have sex
with each other.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.630
- What are you thirsty for?
- I'm feeling wine right now.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.499
- Yeah, that sounds great.
Any--

21:39.532 --> 21:40.800
- But don't let me pressure you.
You can have--

21:40.833 --> 21:44.404
- No, I'm--wine sounds great.
- Thank you.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.738
- Find anything to drink?
- Yes, I--

21:45.772 --> 21:47.374
- I think so.
- I know--

21:47.407 --> 21:48.808
We're ordering the same thing?
- Let's do it.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.876
- Can we do two glasses
of Sancerre?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.344
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.211
- You're welcome.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.413
- So have you ever
been here before?

21:53.446 --> 21:54.347
- I have.
- Oh, you have?

21:54.381 --> 21:55.848
- I love this place.
- It's a good spot.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.584
- So nice choice.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.651
- Thank you.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.555
- Thank you.
Well, cheers.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.691
- Cheers.
It's very nice meeting you.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.459
- Very nice to meet you too.

22:08.728 --> 22:09.629
- It's good.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.831
So what do you like to do
in L.A. for fun?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.433
- I love to shop.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.503
I love to go to lunch,
the most basic ever.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.439
- Are you pretty pumped now
that Runyon's open for hiking?

22:19.472 --> 22:20.840
- No.
- No? Not your--not your vibe?

22:20.873 --> 22:23.376
- I'm not really
into physical activity.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.445
I prefer to stay,
like, sedentary.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.579
What do you do?

22:26.613 --> 22:30.717
- I work to automate solutions
through technologies.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.585
- I don't know
what you just said.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.755
Did you just say "automate
solutions technology"?

22:37.624 --> 22:40.793
- So I--probably, like,
at 7:00 a.m. I'll wake up.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.963
- You wake up at 7:00 a.m.
every day?

22:45.532 --> 22:48.868
Do you know how, like,
important sleeping is?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.770
I'm, like, convinced

22:50.803 --> 22:52.872
that that's why I'm pretty.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.543
- I agree.
- It's sleeping.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.810
- How long have you been single?

22:57.844 --> 23:01.180
- Not that long, like,
a month and a half?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.014
- Wow.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.416
- It was a three-year
relationship

23:03.450 --> 23:04.417
that was on and off.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.619
It made me realize
that I like being independent,

23:06.653 --> 23:09.589
and I like not having
to answer to somebody,

23:09.622 --> 23:12.492
and that--it was always--
that was stressful,

23:12.525 --> 23:13.693
but maybe it was stressful just

23:13.726 --> 23:15.194
because it was it
the wrong person.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.029
- I think it takes
a strong person to realize

23:17.063 --> 23:20.733
that you care for this person,
you love this person,

23:20.767 --> 23:23.936
but you just might not be
the right fit for each other.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.872
- I'm thankful
it finally is done.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.040
- You're a committee of one.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.776
- Well, three,
'cause I have two dogs.

23:29.809 --> 23:30.843
[laughter]

23:30.877 --> 23:33.746
This dude could
not be more nice.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.516
This is the type of guy
that I should want to date

23:36.549 --> 23:39.686
as opposed to
a psychopathic bartender

23:39.719 --> 23:42.455
who steals sandwiches
from gas stations

23:42.489 --> 23:44.957
or someone who tries
to sell my sex tapes.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.560
Well, I'm happy
that I got to come tonight.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.662
- Absolutely.
- You could have, like,

23:49.696 --> 23:52.799
roofied me and, like,
kidnapped me and murdered me,

23:52.832 --> 23:54.033
which is why I turned
my location on

23:54.066 --> 23:55.502
for my friends...

23:55.535 --> 23:57.737
- [laughter]

23:57.770 --> 23:58.971
- Just in case.

24:00.707 --> 24:01.874
I'm just not feeling it.

24:01.908 --> 24:05.645
I mean, I was hoping that
this dude wouldn't be murder-y,

24:05.678 --> 24:07.947
but now I feel like
he's not murder-y enough.

24:07.980 --> 24:08.948
Thank you so much.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.082
- Absolutely.
- It was so nice meeting you.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.985
- It was nice to meet you too.
- Like, maybe I should

24:13.019 --> 24:14.521
split the difference

24:14.554 --> 24:17.957
and, like, date somebody
manslaughter-y.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.258
Thank you so much.
- You bet.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.993
See ya.
- Bye.

24:21.027 --> 24:28.067
*

24:30.837 --> 24:31.971
- Oh, my God.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.006
- Dude.
- Whoa.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.041
- This is really grotesque,
by the way.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.710
- I--it's supposed to be,
like, over-the-top.

24:37.744 --> 24:38.645
- I don't like it.

24:38.678 --> 24:41.748
Like, I mean,
if Lisa wants it, I guess,

24:41.781 --> 24:43.983
but I feel like its eyes
follow me around when I move.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.653
- It's gonna look good
in the shots.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.120
- Bubba, I'm pretty sure
it's haunted.

24:48.154 --> 24:51.724
Can we put, like,
something over its eyes?

24:51.758 --> 24:54.661
Oh, my God.
There, that's much better.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.863
He was judging.
- It's appetizing.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.099
So the first shots,
we're gonna use this fella here.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.602
- In the same vein
of the previous

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
Sur shoots, sexy, obviously.
- Yeah.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.638
- Sexy, unique.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.007
- Looking hot, and we're gonna
get somewhat naked.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.576
- Am I gonna be part
of this or what?

25:09.609 --> 25:10.943
- I think we need more dudes,

25:10.977 --> 25:12.579
and I know you don't work
at Sur,

25:12.612 --> 25:15.615
but you have worked
for the company.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
- I'm a reg. I'm not sure
you can afford me, Bubba.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.785
You know, I don't get out of bed
for less

25:18.818 --> 25:20.753
than $10,000 a day,
and it's just, like--

25:20.787 --> 25:22.321
- I know. That's why you spend
a lot of time in bed.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.724
- I'll give you
the fiancée discount.

25:24.757 --> 25:25.925
- Oh, okay, thanks.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.962
Wouldn't be the worst thing
for us to kind of show Lisa,

25:29.996 --> 25:31.664
like,
"Look at, we're doing good."

25:31.698 --> 25:34.166
- Yeah. Ooh, Bubby.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.605
Lisa's advice for us is to
be in each other's presence

25:38.638 --> 25:40.773
and reaffirm our love
for each other,

25:40.807 --> 25:41.908
so we're gonna do that.

25:41.941 --> 25:42.942
I got chicken piccata.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.811
Whoa, I forgot
I got calamari.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.812
We're definitely

25:45.845 --> 25:47.179
not gonna have summer bodies
for the photo shoot.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.916
- Who cares?
- Who gives a sh--?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.050
Yeah, so [inaudible].

25:51.083 --> 25:52.118
- I'm glad you're gonna
do the shoot.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.052
- Yeah. I'm there to--

25:53.085 --> 25:55.054
- It will be really nice
to have you there.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.789
- I am here for you.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.157
I know I've done a lot of
f---ed-up things.

25:58.190 --> 26:03.062
I know I've--hasn't--
I haven't been faithful.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.597
I feel terrible about that.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.665
I don't know
if I've ever really told you.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.735
I feel really bad about it.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.869
- I want to leave that sh--
in the past.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.004
I don't want to--like,
we're starting a new chapter.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.607
I don't need--we don't need
to bring that garbage into it.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.810
- No, I agree.

26:17.844 --> 26:21.013
- I was able to forgive Tom
for cheating

26:21.047 --> 26:23.916
because I know
that's not who Tom is,

26:23.950 --> 26:26.919
and I don't have any more
doubts in my head about Tom,

26:26.953 --> 26:30.022
and that is refreshing.

26:30.056 --> 26:33.392
I really felt I got
the answers that I needed,

26:33.425 --> 26:37.196
and now I can trust Tom to
not let that happen ever again.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.965
- Bubby, I love you.
- I love you.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.800
- And I feel like
I don't tell you enough.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.068
I just pretty much want
to order takeout

26:42.101 --> 26:43.102
and watch Pauly Shore movies

26:43.135 --> 26:44.771
with you
for the rest of my life.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.039
- Maybe, like, we one day
could get abs.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.841
We could do it together.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.977
Are we ever gonna have abs?

26:51.010 --> 26:53.112
No.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.047
Remember when we used to,
like, eat a whole lot,

26:55.081 --> 26:56.816
and then we'd have fat sex,
like, all day?

26:56.849 --> 26:57.917
- We're having fat sex?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.151
- Yeah, 'cause fat sex
is lazy sex.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.687
- Dibs bottom.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.254
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not gonna lie,

27:02.288 --> 27:03.990
my confidence
in moving forward

27:04.023 --> 27:05.858
with this wedding
has wavered a few times

27:05.892 --> 27:07.126
over the past few months,

27:07.159 --> 27:09.228
but, like, in the last few days

27:09.261 --> 27:12.699
we have made a concerted effort
to remind each other

27:12.732 --> 27:15.935
why we're doing this
in the first place.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.804
Bubby, I love you.
- I love you too.

27:17.837 --> 27:18.838
- Coming up...

27:18.871 --> 27:20.840
- Scheana sent me a photo
from the Sur shoot.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.208
- What?
- "I'm not okay with this.

27:29.215 --> 27:36.122
*

27:50.369 --> 27:52.805
- I'm not a morning person
at all.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.006
- Me either.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.475
- This is my first time
doing a Sur photo shoot.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.910
It's, like, a rite of passage.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.179
I'm officially part
of the family.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.914
Is there somewhere specific
we put it?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.215
- Probably where it says
our name.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.083
- Oh.
[laughs]

28:06.518 --> 28:09.121
- I don't love these
Sur photo shoots.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.256
Hi.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.825
It's kind of like that
awkward office Christmas party

28:12.859 --> 28:14.426
that you know you have to go to,

28:14.460 --> 28:17.964
except at this party
I got to be naked.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.498
[laughter]

28:19.531 --> 28:22.468
- Wow, Peter,
be careful with your--

28:22.501 --> 28:23.903
both: Ah!

28:23.936 --> 28:31.143
*

28:32.845 --> 28:33.913
- You guys are
from that app, right?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.381
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.516
- I totally have the Priv app.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.386
Should have just had you
come to my house this morning.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.222
- So I know the first shot
you want it to be all the girls.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.824
- Yeah, the four girls
in the room.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.392
- I'll go check on--I think
the girls are almost done,

28:46.425 --> 28:47.393
but I'll make sure when

28:47.426 --> 28:48.895
they're finished
they get over to [inaudible].

28:48.928 --> 28:49.929
- Okay, great.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.801
- Hello, girls.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.335
Are we ready for a fun day?
- Yes.

28:56.368 --> 28:57.937
- There are many
ingredients today

28:57.970 --> 28:59.806
to make this
a successful shoot.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.540
We've got to do
hair and makeup.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.410
We've got to organize
the clothes or lack of them,

29:04.443 --> 29:07.279
and we've got to open,
so time is of the essence.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.547
Ariana, get off the phone.
We're here.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.283
We need group energy.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.785
- So you want to just use this?
- Yeah.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.020
- To fill?
- Fill, mm-hmm.

29:14.053 --> 29:14.954
- Ambient?

29:14.987 --> 29:16.488
- Can you bring
that pig thing over here?

29:16.522 --> 29:17.556
- Pig flying in.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.558
*

29:19.591 --> 29:20.927
- Where are the roses?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.929
Somebody find out
about the rose petals.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.399
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.035
- Whoa.
- Ready for dinner?

29:29.068 --> 29:30.169
It's not real.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.571
- It seems really slimy, though.
- Yeah, it looks greasy.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.841
Sur should use these photos
to update their website.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.909
I mean, the website still
has Kristen and Stassi on it.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.410
They haven't worked here
for years.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.947
- Go on, get out of here.
Go make yourself look cute.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.349
- Thanks for showing up, dude.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.616
Probably gonna have
to show your dong.

29:44.650 --> 29:49.255
- No, I'm not showing my dong.
- Yeah, with some fruit on it.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.290
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.391
Oh, wow, so you're ready?

29:52.424 --> 29:53.225
- I brought lots of options.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.126
- You brought a lot
of stuff, okay.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.194
- And then I brought
even more options.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.462
When you're coming
to a photo shoot,

29:56.495 --> 30:00.933
it's always good to make sure
you're prepared for anything.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.935
I got formal looks.
I got casual looks.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.838
I got a lot of color.
I got muted colors.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.040
I come prepared, baby.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.408
How's it going? Tom.
- Nicole.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.944
- He already did his own makeup,
Nicole,

30:11.978 --> 30:13.445
so you won't have to do it.
Even if he didn't, good luck.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.713
He'll tell you everything.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.482
- Don't be afraid to call him
out if there's already a layer.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.350
- Yeah, he'll tell you
how to do your job, 100%.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.486
- Trust me, I'll be way easier
to do makeup

30:20.519 --> 30:22.321
on than either
one of these guys.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.023
- That's good.
Now it looks good.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.625
- Yeah, it looks good.
- Now look sexy, you guys.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.626
I think one of you

30:27.659 --> 30:30.062
could be licking
a chocolate cake or something.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.563
- Scheana's good
at the mouth finger.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.032
- I need to get
my eyebrows done.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.066
They're getting a little hairy.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.501
- Yeah, I don't know
what to do with that hair.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.602
It's too clean.
Yeah, it's too clean.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.905
- I don't care about the makeup
so much as the hair.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.106
- Can we just blow it straight?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.041
- And you guys are talking about
how I'm high-maintenance.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.409
All I'm hearing is you guys.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.945
Actually, I don't know
if I'm feeling this.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.947
Can we just wipe it all off
and start all over?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.949
- Sure.
- I'm just kidding.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.051
- Nice, and Scheana, at me,
looking at me.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.052
Yeah.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.021
[camera shutter clicks]

30:55.054 --> 30:56.122
Nice.
That's great.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.524
- Next thing's the guys
in the lounge.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.591
- Lisa.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.659
- Yes, darling?
- Hi.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.328
- How are you doing?
- I'm fabulous.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.030
The shoot couldn't have
gone on without me.

31:04.063 --> 31:08.334
- Oh, I think we'd be just fine,
but I'm glad you're here.

31:08.367 --> 31:12.905
*

31:12.939 --> 31:14.140
- This is so cute.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.674
- Yeah, I've never been here.
It's cute.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.077
- Honestly, the fact that
I got my medical marijuana card,

31:18.110 --> 31:20.312
when I take an edible
before I go to sleep,

31:20.346 --> 31:21.413
I'm not hungover the next day.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.448
I should be throwing up
right now.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.415
- Are you hungry?

31:23.449 --> 31:25.351
- I want a cocktail, water,
and iced tea.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.452
I, like, want all
of these liquids.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.021
- I think I'm gonna do
an Arnold Palmer with vodka.

31:29.055 --> 31:34.994
- That is a great idea.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.129
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.197
- You're most welcome.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.333
- So Scheana sent me a photo
from the Sur shoot.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.002
- What?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.636
- She goes,
"I'm not okay with this.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.339
Be glad you're not here,"
and I go, "What the hell?"

31:47.373 --> 31:49.708
and then she goes, "It's fake,
but still not cool."

31:49.741 --> 31:52.044
- Oh, who cares?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.579
I remember doing
Sur photo shoots.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.048
That sh-- used to be really fun.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.117
- Amazing, amazing,
very beautiful.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.952
Perfect.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.487
- You know what else
was really fun?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.554
I was 20 pounds lighter.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.992
- I want to hear about
your big date last night.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.626
Did he try to kiss you?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.461
- No.
- He looked really young.

32:09.495 --> 32:10.429
- He was very cute.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.698
He was super interesting
and smart and nice,

32:12.731 --> 32:16.168
but, like,
I need more of, like, a man.

32:16.202 --> 32:18.570
I tried, but I need somebody
a little older.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.771
I want to be the young skank,

32:19.805 --> 32:22.975
not get left for a young skank,
you know what I'm saying?

32:23.009 --> 32:24.476
- What did you drink at dinner?

32:24.510 --> 32:25.744
- Wine.
That was another thing.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.013
He ordered whatever
I would order.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.081
- But he was, like, the girl,
and you were, like, the dude.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.182
- Yeah.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.584
- Stassi just needs to date
a guy who has their sh--

32:32.618 --> 32:34.620
together, and here in L.A.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.089
most guys don't really reach
that point until mid-30s,

32:37.123 --> 32:39.591
so 35 and up, and Jax is, like,

32:39.625 --> 32:42.561
the only one over 35
that doesn't count.

32:42.594 --> 32:46.432
You gonna keep, like, being open
to going out on dates?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.200
- I'm gonna be open to anything,

32:48.234 --> 32:50.069
but I'm so wrapped up
in Katie's wedding right now,

32:50.102 --> 32:52.771
I'm not even gonna think
about that type of stuff.

32:52.804 --> 32:57.543
- 'Cause right now the only
problem is Lisa Vanderpump.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.678
At first I was like,
"What the f---?"

32:59.711 --> 33:00.779
I can appreciate that she, like,

33:00.812 --> 33:03.182
takes marriage as seriously
as it should be taken.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.017
- I think she just wants
to be like, "You guys,

33:05.051 --> 33:06.785
this is f---ing serious,"
and that's fair.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.719
They've been doing so well,

33:07.753 --> 33:10.089
so Lisa was actually smart
to say all that.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.124
- Yeah.

33:12.158 --> 33:13.525
- Wow, I just said that.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.094
[both laugh]

33:15.127 --> 33:15.961
- Coming up...

33:15.994 --> 33:17.596
- I feel left out
of certain things.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.231
- I didn't know that you wanted
to be included.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.600
- I don't know.
I guess I just miss, like, us.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.180
- Like this?

33:34.213 --> 33:35.447
- Can we do this in,
like, two minutes?

33:35.481 --> 33:36.482
And let's get on with--

33:37.383 --> 33:37.416
- I love the--I love
the way you think.

33:38.050 --> 33:38.584
- Oh, Lisa.
- I know.

33:39.518 --> 33:39.551
You do everything
in two minutes, Taylor,

33:40.286 --> 33:41.687
so I know that, right?
Tommy,

33:42.888 --> 33:46.292
if I look ugly, I'm gonna come
find you, I swear to God.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.194
- Lisa's dress looks
so good in those photos.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.729
Like, the pink? All the lights
in here are like so hot

33:50.762 --> 33:52.398
I'm gonna sit
outside for a sec.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.666
- I know, it is
really warm, right?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.202
Oh, much better.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.469
- Ah.

33:57.503 --> 34:00.172
- There were some things
I wanted to ask you,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.674
because I've never been,
like, in, like, a wedding.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.243
- Yeah.
- So I don't know

34:05.377 --> 34:07.179
how rehearsal dinners work
or how, like, speeches work.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.714
- Let's make a list of,
like, everyone,

34:08.747 --> 34:10.316
and you can put, like,
a star by, like,

34:10.349 --> 34:12.218
who wants to do a speech
and then decide

34:12.251 --> 34:14.253
who at the rehearsal dinner,
who at the wedding.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.354
- Mm-hmm.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.223
- I know I texted you
last night.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.524
I feel like I've been kind of,

34:18.557 --> 34:21.260
like, left out
of certain things.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.195
- What?
- You're but it's like,restill f

34:23.229 --> 34:25.231
I just miss that individual,
like, closeness.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.232
We haven't, like,

34:26.265 --> 34:27.566
just, like, hung out,
like, one on one lately.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.567
- I didn't even think
about that.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.602
- I mean, this is not
your problem right now.

34:30.636 --> 34:31.870
- I know.
I don't want you to be upset.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.239
- I just want to tell you, like,
I just--I want to be included

34:33.272 --> 34:34.406
as much as possible.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.407
- I want you to be included.

34:35.441 --> 34:36.608
I didn't know that you wanted
to be included.

34:36.642 --> 34:40.279
- Of course I do. I want to do
everything I can for you.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.648
Katie and I had a rough go
at being friends this summer.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.650
- A lot of people feel that
you're fake a lot of times.

34:44.683 --> 34:45.717
- Then why the f---

34:45.751 --> 34:46.752
are you friends with me
if I'm fake?

34:46.785 --> 34:48.654
- Calm down.
- No.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.389
F--- this.
God.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.658
There were just so many things

34:52.691 --> 34:54.393
that were going wrong
in our friendship.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.394
I just miss you.

34:55.427 --> 34:59.198
- I miss you too, so I just--
I hope you know

34:59.231 --> 35:02.368
that you are
just important to me than ever.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.670
- Yeah. I do want you to know
that I want to be included,

35:04.703 --> 35:06.372
and I love you,
and I just, like--

35:06.405 --> 35:08.274
- I love you too. Don't cry.
Your makeup--

35:08.307 --> 35:10.276
- I know.
- See?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.411
Productive. I love you.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.679
- I love you.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.681
- Ariana, get your perfect,

35:15.714 --> 35:17.449
little, skinny butt
in here, please.

35:17.483 --> 35:20.819
- Nobody brush up against me
'cause I have body makeup on.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.421
- Put it on there.
Put them in there.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.290
Cover her in rose petals.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.624
Feed her some chocolate cake.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.393
Put a glass of wine in his hand.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.528
Have them fornicate
on the table, and let's go.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.830
Is this the best job
you've ever had?

35:31.863 --> 35:33.532
- I'll be the pig, like,
from the last shot.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.466
- We've actually got--

35:34.500 --> 35:35.667
- Just put an apple in my mouth.
- We good?

35:35.701 --> 35:36.702
- Let's take a rose bush--
- Can we have somebody just go

35:36.735 --> 35:38.604
and grab all of the--
all those tapes in the back?

35:38.637 --> 35:39.738
- To cover your bush,
darling.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.806
- Like, in there?

35:40.839 --> 35:44.210
- Yeah, like, so it looks
kind of more--like that.

35:44.243 --> 35:47.446
It's all you need
to be doing right now.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.315
- Modeling for almost 20 years.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.849
- Do you think it's
too long, 20 years?

35:50.882 --> 35:52.718
- When you're doing
a photo shoot like this,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.721
the last thing you want
is to get a boner.

35:55.754 --> 35:59.491
If you're at 6:00,
it comes up like this,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.293
and you end up pitching a tent.

36:01.327 --> 36:05.364
If you're already facing 12:00,
it won't come out,

36:05.397 --> 36:06.765
or you kind of hide it
on the right leg,

36:06.798 --> 36:09.401
and that way it
doesn't have far to go.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.571
- Come in to Sur
and eat off Ariana's ass.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.840
Yeah, see?
That looks pretty now.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.843
That looks pretty.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.745
- Look at you, sexy.

36:19.778 --> 36:23.849
[camera shutter clicking]

36:23.882 --> 36:25.484
- Am I doing a good job?

36:25.517 --> 36:26.618
- Yes.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.320
Well, I saw a little bit of--
- That was rhetorical.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.721
- You guys with, like, Lisa,
and it looks,

36:29.755 --> 36:31.257
like, so cool with her, like--

36:31.290 --> 36:32.358
- I know.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.759
Should we have a backup
in case of, like, you know,

36:33.792 --> 36:35.794
some sort of emergency
or something?

36:35.827 --> 36:37.763
- Like--
- Oh, my good lord.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.531
- Could you find a smaller pair
of underwear, please?

36:39.565 --> 36:40.632
- Little model twink.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.434
Yeah, look how
small his butt is.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.370
Jesus, that thing is tiny.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.838
- That's what I like to see,
see you smiling

36:46.872 --> 36:47.973
and looking at each other.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.709
I want to talk to you guys
later, but not now, right?

36:50.742 --> 36:51.710
- Okay.
- Well, that's--

36:51.743 --> 36:53.545
we were hoping we could talk.
- Later, later.

36:53.579 --> 36:56.282
Let me just wind this up.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.849
- We're a team,
the Millennium Schwartzes.

36:57.883 --> 36:58.884
- Hey, guys.

36:58.917 --> 36:59.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.787
- Ready for you in the VIP room.
- Okay.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.790
- Thinking it should be
quite tight, him behind her,

37:04.823 --> 37:07.293
maybe his arms round her,
giving her a rose.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.394
That's it.
That's [inaudible]

37:08.427 --> 37:11.897
. The ring, yeah.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.599
Okay, open your eyes.

37:13.632 --> 37:14.900
See, look how beautiful that is.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.536
I really am happy
to see that Schwartzy

37:17.569 --> 37:19.705
and Katie are going
in the right direction.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.774
They've got the potential
for such a great relationship,

37:22.808 --> 37:25.411
and I certainly gave them
a giant push there,

37:25.444 --> 37:26.545
that's for sure,

37:26.578 --> 37:29.348
but it seems like they've
really taken it to heart.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.682
Look at her,
and you open your eyes.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.418
That's it. That's sweet.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.320
Just one lovely portrait

37:34.353 --> 37:35.687
just before
you're getting married.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.589
Lovely. I think we got it.
- Great.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.327
- Ah, I love milk.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.429
- Milk's not good for you.
- Yes, it is.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.796
It's great for you
every now and then.

37:44.830 --> 37:45.897
When was the last time
I drank milk?

37:45.931 --> 37:47.433
- I mean, you can do
what you want.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.834
I just--I personally
just don't want to.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.869
- You look handsome, though.
- Thank you.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.342
- What about me?

37:56.375 --> 37:57.476
You're supposed to say it back.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.546
- I told you you
look beautiful twice.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.748
- I want to hear it
all the time.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.883
- I've said it twice.
Am I wrong?

38:04.916 --> 38:07.486
I don't--I think that's enough.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.620
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes, please.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.422
- 'Cause we're trying
to get everyone in position, so.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.423
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.391
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.728
- Where would you like us?
- So one on the--

38:16.762 --> 38:17.596
- Sit on, like, the back?
- Sit on--yeah, on the back.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.365
- Yeah, you can sit on,
like, the back.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.667
- Ken's gonna go next
to Scheana's legs,

38:21.700 --> 38:24.503
and then there'll be me,
then Jax,

38:24.536 --> 38:27.873
Naomi there, GG next to Naomi.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.976
Lauren, you can go
right next to Sandoval there.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.878
Well, that looks good, okay?
So--

38:32.911 --> 38:34.846
- Lisa, are you gonna use, like,
a diving board to,

38:34.880 --> 38:37.616
like, get some air
and, like, somersault in?

38:37.649 --> 38:38.684
- You know what?

38:38.717 --> 38:40.886
I am, like, a real pro
at going under the table.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.988
- Uh-oh.
- Not that, Ken.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.757
- You can do it.
- Oh, oh.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.460
- [whistles]
- Oh, my god. Wild, darling.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.995
- You made it.
- Oh, my God, ow.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.563
- Yeah.

38:51.597 --> 38:52.964
- Whoo-hoo!
- Everyone looking here?

38:52.998 --> 38:54.600
- Ready, go.
- Excellent.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.602
[camera shutter clicking]

38:56.635 --> 39:00.772
- Sur has always been somewhere
that's sexy, that's fun,

39:00.806 --> 39:04.743
and the people who work here
reflect that.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.413
- Okay, yeah, change it up just
a little bit with every frame.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.416
- Ken and Nathalie
and Guillermo and I

39:10.449 --> 39:12.551
love to have this photo shoot

39:12.584 --> 39:14.986
just to document
the life of Sur.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.154
- That's great.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.890
- There's a lot of closeness
in this group,

39:18.924 --> 39:23.562
and it always makes me feel
like it's an extended family.

39:23.595 --> 39:24.996
I really love it.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.832
- All right, I think we got it.
That's a wrap.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.567
all: Yay!

39:28.600 --> 39:29.601
- All right.

39:29.635 --> 39:30.602
- Coming up...

39:30.636 --> 39:33.772
Since we had our talk,
did it change anything?

39:33.805 --> 39:35.807
You need to look at each other
and remember

39:43.148 --> 39:50.088
*

39:52.023 --> 39:53.124
- Hi.
- What's going on?

39:53.158 --> 39:54.192
- We're just gonna go meet Lisa.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.194
- All righty, guys, enjoy.
- Thank you. Right here?

39:56.227 --> 39:58.163
- Yup.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.165
- Dude, I had, like, a layer
caked on of my makeup.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.399
I couldn't--my skin
couldn't breathe.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.969
- You know, I forget that I have
so much makeup on right now.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.203
- Oh, my God.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.972
I feel like we've gone
through 20 years'

40:07.005 --> 40:08.974
worth of relationship
in 5 years.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.543
We've broken up.
We've yelled. We've screamed.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.178
We went through
the no-sex phase,

40:13.211 --> 40:15.581
just petty squabble phase,

40:15.614 --> 40:17.115
oh, the worst of them all.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.049
- Ew. For the first time,

40:18.083 --> 40:20.118
I think we actually
looked at ourselves

40:20.151 --> 40:22.187
through other people's eyes,

40:22.220 --> 40:25.156
and I haven't taken care
of my relationship

40:25.190 --> 40:28.927
in the way I should, and Tom and
I haven't always been united,

40:28.960 --> 40:30.529
and we need to be.
- Hey, you guys.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.997
Shall I join you for a second?
- Yes.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.999
- Yes, we would love that.
- You look gorgeous.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:35.033 --> 40:38.036
- Since we had our talk,
did it change anything?

40:38.069 --> 40:39.304
- Like, the small things.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.006
Like, we kiss each other goodbye
now. You know, like, we fell--

40:41.039 --> 40:42.974
- Yeah, we look each other
in the eyes.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.076
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but we stopped doing that.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.613
- No, it doesn't. That's exactly
part of your homework.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.648
- Yeah.
- You need to look at each other

40:49.681 --> 40:52.050
and remember why you fell
in love with each other.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.586
- I remember now more than ever.
- Yeah.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.555
For a long time
our relationship,

40:56.588 --> 41:00.759
for me, was overshadowed, like,
just by so much negativity.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.127
- There was--
- But now it's like,

41:02.160 --> 41:03.094
all the good memories
have been--come flooding--

41:03.128 --> 41:05.030
- She's so beautiful as well.
That helps.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.199
- Yeah, she's not too shabby.
- I mean, come on.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.168
- That's perfect.
Thank you so much.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.637
- Enjoy, guys.
- Thank you.

41:11.670 --> 41:14.139
So how about that answer?

41:14.172 --> 41:18.009
- Well...

41:18.043 --> 41:20.646
yes, Schwartzy, Katie,

41:20.679 --> 41:24.650
I am happy and honored now

41:24.683 --> 41:26.017
to officiate your wedding.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.218
- Aww.
- Yay.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.020
- You're gonna make me cry.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.556
Can I give you a hug?
- Of course you may.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.658
- Aww, I love you.
- I love you both very much.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.593
- I really do.
We really appreciate it.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.027
I want to kiss Lisa right now.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.596
I mean, I always want
to kiss her,

41:37.629 --> 41:41.099
but, like, especially right now
I want to kiss Lisa.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.668
- And when I say
you deserve each other,

41:42.701 --> 41:44.670
I mean that
in the best way possible.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.005
You're both lovely,
lovely people.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.540
- Can you say it one more time?
- No.

41:48.574 --> 41:49.440
- Just kidding, no.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.743
- Will you tattoo my name
on your ass?

41:51.777 --> 41:52.744
- I will.

41:52.778 --> 41:54.646
[laughter]

41:54.680 --> 41:57.549
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

41:57.583 --> 41:59.651
- Hi, Lisa.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.020
- Bloody hell.
Stone the crows.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.222
Miss Kent is back.

42:04.255 --> 42:07.559
- Damn!
- Vagina's showing.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.561
This is one way
to get your mojo back.

42:09.595 --> 42:13.064
- You look...insane.
Love that.

42:13.098 --> 42:14.766
- I actually don't work, so...

42:14.800 --> 42:15.767
- [gasps]

42:15.801 --> 42:17.235
- But it's really put

42:17.268 --> 42:19.170
what truly matters to me
in perspective,

42:19.204 --> 42:21.673
and that is, you know,
your daughter especially.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.241
- Aww.
- Sorry.

42:23.274 --> 42:24.342
- Hey, what's up, man?

42:24.375 --> 42:26.578
It's Tom and Jax.
- Hey! What's up, player?

42:26.612 --> 42:28.146
- You want to come
to your brother's wedding?

42:28.179 --> 42:29.314
- Of course I do!

42:29.347 --> 42:31.316
- Do not tell Tom at all
about any of this.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.051
This is all a surprise.

42:33.084 --> 42:34.185
- Aren't we supposed to tie,
like,

42:34.219 --> 42:35.220
empty soda cans to our car?

42:35.253 --> 42:37.355
- That's if you guys make it
past the wedding.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.690
- If?

42:40.291 --> 42:41.259
- Hey.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.094
- Bridesmaids.
- Hoo-ha-ha.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.262
- Oh, yo.
- Hey!

42:44.295 --> 42:46.197
- Hey!
- What?

42:46.231 --> 42:48.266
- His f---ing brothers
missed their flight.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.669
Your f---ing brother's wedding,
what the f--- is wrong with you?

42:50.702 --> 42:51.502
- Shh, Tom doesn't know.
Stop, hey.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.071
- I know.
I got to call Sandoval.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.272
I have to call Tom.

42:54.305 --> 42:57.308
