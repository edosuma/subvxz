00:44.549 --> 00:46.619
How are you feeling today,
Mr. Harris?

01:01.900 --> 01:05.438
Wow, I like your hair.

01:17.784 --> 01:18.982
Hello.

01:18.984 --> 01:21.520
He wanted this next to him
on his deathbed.

01:24.457 --> 01:26.723
His instructions
were very specific.

01:26.725 --> 01:28.794
Did you know him?
Nobody from his fa...

05:21.960 --> 05:25.095
Ok. Soap.
One, two, three.

05:25.097 --> 05:28.767
Wipe.
One, two, three.

05:30.169 --> 05:32.104
One, two, three.

05:34.373 --> 05:35.709
Hello, Charlie.

05:36.709 --> 05:37.844
I miss you, buddy.

05:50.022 --> 05:51.024
Hello?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.036
Hello?

06:22.755 --> 06:23.890
Hello?

06:36.234 --> 06:37.770
Is somebody there?

06:43.775 --> 06:46.045
One, two, three.

06:49.481 --> 06:51.183
Come on, David,
pull it together.

07:31.957 --> 07:33.093
<i>David?</i>

07:55.147 --> 07:56.149
Shit!

07:58.984 --> 08:00.120
Hello?

08:00.385 --> 08:02.921
<i>David. I have some news.</i>

08:03.188 --> 08:04.256
<i>It's about dad.</i>

08:04.890 --> 08:06.860
<i>He passed
just about an hour ago.</i>

08:09.128 --> 08:11.931
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes.

08:13.532 --> 08:14.901
<i>Are you ok?</i>

08:16.534 --> 08:17.871
Of course.

08:18.938 --> 08:21.171
<i>Listen, it's ok,
however you feel.</i>

08:21.173 --> 08:23.143
<i>He can't hurt you anymore,
David.</i>

08:31.883 --> 08:35.188
So... explain the connection
to me again.

08:37.155 --> 08:39.957
They hate me, I hate them,
strictly business.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.191
Your ex's father dies,

08:42.193 --> 08:44.160
you're not really part
of the family anymore,

08:44.163 --> 08:46.296
so why are we going
to the will reading?

08:46.298 --> 08:48.031
Good question.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.633
I made the guy a lot of money
back in the day,

08:49.635 --> 08:52.902
and where was Richie's make?
Huh?

08:52.904 --> 08:54.207
Like, where's Richie's make?

08:55.573 --> 08:56.907
- Darren!
- What?

08:56.909 --> 08:58.044
What are you doing?

08:59.077 --> 09:00.576
I'm trying to call my dealer,

09:00.578 --> 09:02.178
he was supposed to be here!

09:02.180 --> 09:05.050
Your drug dealer is
untrustworthy? That's so sad!

09:06.318 --> 09:08.351
He was supposed to be here
45 minutes ago.

09:08.353 --> 09:11.187
You should totally write a
really nasty Yelp review.

09:11.189 --> 09:13.190
- Just five minutes, ok? Please.
- No! No!

09:13.192 --> 09:16.129
We had to be there in
40 minutes, we're already late!

09:17.929 --> 09:19.064
I've got nothing.

09:19.331 --> 09:20.967
It's not gonna be pretty.

09:26.972 --> 09:29.672
What? Come on, go! Jesus.

09:29.674 --> 09:31.240
Hi, Kelly!

09:31.242 --> 09:33.210
It's so good to see you.
Oh my god, you too, Darren!

09:33.212 --> 09:36.348
It's been so long. I know.
Hey, happy birthday, by the way.

09:38.983 --> 09:40.149
What about Michelle?

09:40.151 --> 09:42.119
We were so young
when we got married,

09:42.121 --> 09:44.957
- it didn't end well.
- Well, I'm here.

09:45.957 --> 09:47.025
Oh, yes, you are.

09:48.059 --> 09:51.363
And pretty, and hot,
and sexy, and full of life.

09:53.698 --> 09:55.101
And I love you.

09:57.236 --> 09:59.271
Oh, speak French to me.

10:00.271 --> 10:01.171
Oh, Jesus!

10:05.443 --> 10:06.509
Are you ok?

10:06.511 --> 10:08.113
Oh, my God!

10:08.380 --> 10:10.116
Did we almost just die?

10:11.183 --> 10:12.918
On the way to a will reading?

10:16.989 --> 10:18.388
How long is this gonna take?

10:18.390 --> 10:19.989
You didn't have to come.

10:19.991 --> 10:22.392
It's fine, I mean...
we're getting paid, right?

10:22.394 --> 10:24.994
Darren, we're going
to the reading of a will,

10:24.996 --> 10:26.696
nobody is cutting you
a check today.

10:26.698 --> 10:28.297
All I'm saying is,

10:28.299 --> 10:30.466
why do we have to go to the
Shudden's house to do this?

10:30.468 --> 10:32.004
It's gonna be a disaster.

10:33.072 --> 10:35.272
I mean, when was the last time
he's been on the house?

10:35.274 --> 10:38.008
The guy probably doesn't
know about the internet,

10:38.010 --> 10:40.277
or drones, or black presidents.

10:40.279 --> 10:41.445
Darren.

10:41.447 --> 10:43.448
We have to all be together
to do this...

10:44.082 --> 10:46.016
You are exhausting,
did you know that?

10:46.018 --> 10:47.420
You're giving me a headache.

11:28.059 --> 11:29.194
David?

11:29.595 --> 11:30.964
David, is that you?

11:31.329 --> 11:33.497
<i>Michelle? Can you hear me?
Shit...</i>

11:33.499 --> 11:36.469
- <i>I'm in a parking structure.</i>
- Oh, Barbara, hi!

11:36.735 --> 11:38.234
Yeah, I can hear you.

11:38.236 --> 11:40.070
<i>I thought we could have drinks.</i>

11:40.072 --> 11:42.538
Oh, sweetie, no,
I'd love to, but...

11:42.540 --> 11:44.206
I can't.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.343
I've got a little bit of a
scheduled day today.

11:46.345 --> 11:49.378
- My father just died.
- <i>I'm so sorry to hear that!</i>

11:49.380 --> 11:51.480
No, actually, it's a good thing.

11:51.482 --> 11:54.219
It's a really good thing.

11:55.353 --> 11:58.088
But I'll call you
some other time and try again?

11:58.090 --> 11:59.492
- <i>Yeah, we'll talk later.</i>
- Ok.

12:09.802 --> 12:11.170
Thanks, babe.

12:12.236 --> 12:15.104
Wow! This is so nice,

12:15.106 --> 12:18.243
with all the trees,
and the nature.

12:18.510 --> 12:19.511
Family money.

12:22.347 --> 12:24.314
Well, it's customary to go
and knock on the door

12:24.316 --> 12:26.383
when you get to someone's house,
isn't it?

12:26.385 --> 12:28.317
Oh, you're a comedian now?

12:28.319 --> 12:30.253
- You're a comedian now, huh?
- I am.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.058
This dude lives
in the boondocks.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.126
I think he might have a gun.

12:34.559 --> 12:35.792
Don't worry.

12:35.794 --> 12:37.293
Agoraphobia and aggression

12:37.295 --> 12:39.265
are mutually exclusive
character traits.

12:39.530 --> 12:40.864
We'll be fine.

12:40.866 --> 12:42.434
I have no idea
what you just said.

12:47.573 --> 12:50.340
Richard is here?
He left Michelle years ago.

12:50.342 --> 12:52.274
Who's the girl
with the daddy issues?

12:52.276 --> 12:54.813
Darren. Being nice lasted
for five minutes, huh?

12:57.448 --> 13:01.218
- Rich! Kelly.
- Yes, Kelly, wow!

13:01.220 --> 13:03.152
- You look great!
- Thanks!

13:03.154 --> 13:05.290
- And... Dwayne, right?
- Darren.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.291
- Rich.
- Hey.

13:08.293 --> 13:10.163
Didn't know you had a daughter.

13:11.362 --> 13:12.564
He's funny, isn't he?

13:13.298 --> 13:15.699
Actually, this is my
new fiancée, Cheryl.

13:15.701 --> 13:17.167
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:17.169 --> 13:18.371
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

13:18.837 --> 13:20.237
You know, it's funny.

13:20.239 --> 13:21.571
I really didn't expect
to see you here.

13:21.573 --> 13:24.306
- Darren! That's rude.
- No, no, no. That's fine.

13:24.308 --> 13:25.575
That's fine.

13:25.577 --> 13:27.444
Actually, I thought
it was a little weird too,

13:27.446 --> 13:29.311
but I got a call
from the lawyer,

13:29.313 --> 13:31.580
saying that I'm in the will,
I'm a beneficiary.

13:31.582 --> 13:32.617
How you doing?

13:34.352 --> 13:38.321
So, this is Michelle's
brother's house, David, right?

13:38.323 --> 13:39.523
Yes. That's correct.

13:39.525 --> 13:41.490
I'm so sorry to hear
your uncle's passing.

13:41.492 --> 13:42.527
Thank you.

13:44.462 --> 13:45.865
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

13:52.203 --> 13:53.338
David!

13:53.739 --> 13:55.208
Knock knock!

14:06.684 --> 14:08.487
Hello? David?

14:09.388 --> 14:10.523
It's cousin Kelly.

14:13.292 --> 14:15.624
Well, we are off
to a great start.

14:15.626 --> 14:17.627
Yes, Mr. Gonzalez.
Hi, come on in.

14:17.629 --> 14:19.495
Well, if you want
a guest bathroom,

14:19.497 --> 14:21.230
all we have to do is knock down
the guest room wall.

14:21.232 --> 14:22.632
It will shorten the room
by about three feet,

14:22.634 --> 14:24.301
but you'll have it!

14:24.303 --> 14:25.902
Ok, then.
I will redraw the paperwork

14:25.904 --> 14:27.503
and send it to you tomorrow.

14:27.505 --> 14:28.307
Ok, bye!

14:29.374 --> 14:31.641
- Hi, Kelly!
- It's so good to see you!

14:31.643 --> 14:33.643
Oh, my God, look at you!
You got so tall!

14:33.645 --> 14:35.545
- Your home is beautiful!
- Thank you.

14:35.547 --> 14:38.281
There's a lot of things
I missed with all you guys,

14:38.283 --> 14:39.452
and I just...

14:40.785 --> 14:42.551
Darren! Wow! Look at you.

14:42.553 --> 14:44.387
You know,
the last time I saw you,

14:44.389 --> 14:45.924
you were about that big.

14:46.525 --> 14:49.392
This is just... nowhere near
as bad as we expected.

14:49.394 --> 14:51.393
I'm sorry, we were told
you were like...

14:51.395 --> 14:53.662
- really fucked up.
- Ok, then!

14:53.664 --> 14:57.569
Also, don't I remember you
being, like, really fat?

14:58.337 --> 15:00.405
It's ok, I remember
you being polite.

15:01.505 --> 15:03.473
David, hey!
We actually never met.

15:03.475 --> 15:05.609
Richard Lambplan.
You were married to Michelle

15:05.611 --> 15:07.543
for eight years,
divorced for three.

15:07.545 --> 15:11.284
And I missed the wedding,
and I'm really sorry about that.

15:11.683 --> 15:13.952
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your father.

15:14.419 --> 15:16.422
Thank you.
I'm sorry about the divorce.

15:16.954 --> 15:19.723
You know, you grow up,
you get past it, time heals,

15:19.725 --> 15:22.425
and it makes room
for great things to happen,

15:22.427 --> 15:25.364
like my fiancée, Cheryl.
This is David.

15:25.831 --> 15:27.430
It's really great to meet you.

15:27.432 --> 15:29.635
Hi. Really great to meet you.

15:31.702 --> 15:33.305
He's a very lucky man.

15:35.439 --> 15:37.443
And so are you.

15:38.309 --> 15:39.643
Not that you're a man, 'cause...

15:39.645 --> 15:43.582
you're not a man.
You're a woman.

15:46.318 --> 15:47.716
Ok, why don't you guys
come on in,

15:47.718 --> 15:50.653
make yourselves at home,
and I'll be there in a sec.

15:50.655 --> 15:51.723
Ok?

15:52.457 --> 15:54.460
He seems
like a pretty normal guy.

16:06.737 --> 16:07.739
Strike that.

16:08.472 --> 16:09.741
Soap. One, two, three.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.677
Water. One, two, three.

16:12.343 --> 16:14.347
They'll only be here
an hour or three.

16:14.779 --> 16:16.012
Just an hour or three.

16:17.415 --> 16:19.014
<i>I think
there's someone at the door!</i>

16:19.016 --> 16:20.352
I'll get it!

16:21.620 --> 16:23.485
There he is!
Hey, David,

16:23.487 --> 16:24.753
is there a lawyer
coming from the estate?

16:24.755 --> 16:27.056
- I don't know.
- Michelle is coming, right?

16:27.058 --> 16:28.758
Yeah.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.061
How exactly do you make money
if you can't leave the house?

16:31.063 --> 16:32.630
Will you all please shut up?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.636
I'm sorry.

16:43.674 --> 16:44.676
What is it?

16:45.776 --> 16:46.778
<i>A box.</i>

16:47.813 --> 16:49.381
You're gonna pick it up?

16:50.048 --> 16:54.419
- Maybe you should.
- Yeah. I've got this, boss.

17:08.934 --> 17:11.800
- Why don't you let me get it?
- Thank you.

17:11.803 --> 17:14.073
- Ok.
- Ok.

17:19.544 --> 17:21.079
So sorry, I'm late.

17:22.113 --> 17:25.079
It's just you have such an
adorable little town here,

17:25.082 --> 17:26.616
and I just couldn't help myself,

17:26.617 --> 17:29.088
and I picked up
a couple of things for...

17:29.688 --> 17:33.693
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Michelle.

17:34.892 --> 17:36.828
- I'm Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

17:37.562 --> 17:39.431
I'm here with Rich.

17:40.131 --> 17:41.467
Rich is here?

17:41.967 --> 17:43.869
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hi.

17:44.468 --> 17:45.603
How are you?

17:46.571 --> 17:49.108
So great to see you.
These do not go here.

17:49.707 --> 17:51.640
That's right,
I should have known.

17:51.642 --> 17:52.777
- Silly me.
- Right.

17:53.512 --> 17:55.477
I just picked up
a couple of groceries.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.446
Well, that was
very thoughtful of you.

17:57.448 --> 17:58.715
Well, actually, is just...

17:58.717 --> 18:00.750
I mean, you don't have
anything that I like.

18:00.752 --> 18:02.521
- You look great!
- Oh, do I?

18:03.588 --> 18:04.657
Thank you, sweetie.

18:05.791 --> 18:07.857
God, this whole thing must be
absolutely awful for you.

18:07.859 --> 18:10.596
Let's just get through it
as quickly as we...

18:24.609 --> 18:25.745
Hi, Michelle.

18:28.746 --> 18:29.914
It's good to see you.

18:30.748 --> 18:33.618
I'm surprised you didn't
tell me you were coming.

18:35.152 --> 18:36.521
I thought you knew.

18:37.555 --> 18:39.557
I was surprised
when they called me.

18:41.892 --> 18:43.928
Look, I'm not here
to make a problem.

18:46.497 --> 18:47.665
You met Cheryl?

18:48.900 --> 18:49.901
I did.

18:51.803 --> 18:54.640
It would have been nice
to know you were coming.

18:55.907 --> 18:56.909
Kelly!

18:58.810 --> 19:03.948
- Hi, Michelle!
- Hi! Oh, my gosh!

19:04.949 --> 19:07.719
God, it has been forever!
You look great.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.789
This is gorgeous.

19:11.657 --> 19:14.724
Oh, you know,
your mother gave it to me?

19:14.726 --> 19:15.794
Really?

19:16.794 --> 19:18.727
<i>How are you, how's the job?</i>

19:18.729 --> 19:20.863
<i>Junior partner.
Killing my social life.</i>

19:20.865 --> 19:22.834
<i>I don't see
you have a nicer car.</i>

19:23.935 --> 19:25.968
What the hell
is this supposed to be?

19:25.970 --> 19:27.672
Is it some kind of joke?

19:28.005 --> 19:29.675
Jesus, what is that smell?

19:34.012 --> 19:35.614
No letter came with it.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.750
Maybe the will
is inside the box.

19:40.718 --> 19:41.853
There's no opening.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.823
Nobody makes a box
that doesn't open.

19:48.627 --> 19:49.762
<i>Jesus!</i>

19:52.964 --> 19:54.230
What the hell was that?

19:54.232 --> 19:55.564
What was that?

19:55.566 --> 19:57.000
What's that, fucking fracking?

19:57.002 --> 19:58.135
Fracking?

19:58.137 --> 19:59.836
That did not come from the
ground, that came from above,

19:59.838 --> 20:01.571
like it was a sonic boom,
or something.

20:01.573 --> 20:02.871
Watch out, there's glass there.

20:02.873 --> 20:04.242
I'm gonna get a dust bin
and a broom, everyone,

20:05.274 --> 20:05.643
I'll be right back.

20:20.659 --> 20:23.025
I guess you can't really
leave the room heroically

20:23.027 --> 20:24.262
if you got OCD, huh?

21:41.072 --> 21:42.073
Come on, David.

21:44.342 --> 21:45.942
One, two, three,
nothing to see.

21:45.944 --> 21:48.077
One, two, three,
nothing to see.

21:48.079 --> 21:49.114
One, two, three...

21:52.217 --> 21:53.351
Sorry.

21:54.351 --> 21:56.953
- I thought I could help.
- No, it's my fault.

21:56.955 --> 21:58.691
I didn't know you were there.

21:59.090 --> 22:01.757
I understand what you're
going through, you know?

22:01.759 --> 22:03.094
Family is never easy.

22:03.762 --> 22:04.996
I ran away from mine.

22:05.830 --> 22:06.966
So I get it.

22:08.699 --> 22:09.701
Thanks.

22:10.736 --> 22:13.772
Yeah, my family doesn't
get any of this, just...

22:16.240 --> 22:17.709
See?

22:19.009 --> 22:20.976
I wouldn't do this
if I didn't have to.

22:20.978 --> 22:23.716
I know. I really do understand.

22:25.784 --> 22:27.119
I work in clinical OT.

22:27.419 --> 22:30.119
Obsessive compulsive disorder
is called a disorder

22:30.121 --> 22:32.056
because it's not a crime.

22:32.791 --> 22:33.926
It's not your fault.

22:35.126 --> 22:36.128
Thank you.

22:37.728 --> 22:39.130
You know what I
tell my patients?

22:39.764 --> 22:42.767
- What?
- It's gonna be ok.

22:45.035 --> 22:46.071
Can I help?

22:48.739 --> 22:49.874
Thanks.

22:53.410 --> 22:56.411
Nobody told me that this was
going to be happening this way.

22:56.413 --> 22:58.947
I got a call from the lawyer,
and he assured me

22:58.949 --> 23:00.917
that everything
was gonna be organized.

23:00.919 --> 23:03.753
I can't believe no documentation
came with this thing.

23:03.755 --> 23:05.288
There's a seam,
but there's no...

23:05.290 --> 23:08.427
hinge or latch, anything.

23:09.026 --> 23:11.026
I mean, uncle Harris
was freaking loaded.

23:11.028 --> 23:12.762
He's not gonna leave his family

23:12.764 --> 23:14.030
some stupid box
that doesn't open.

23:14.032 --> 23:16.101
And he never paid me back.

23:16.467 --> 23:18.169
Maybe he finally
made good on it.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.809
It's an e-mail...

23:25.442 --> 23:26.908
from the lawyer.

23:26.910 --> 23:28.778
Yeah, I just got an e-mail
from the lawyer.

23:28.780 --> 23:29.911
Something in Latin.

23:29.913 --> 23:32.982
"Sanguinum tuub ab sex."

23:32.984 --> 23:35.187
Maybe it's the
law office's motto?

23:42.459 --> 23:43.926
What happened?

23:43.928 --> 23:45.797
This thing just
ripped my finger open!

23:50.334 --> 23:51.803
What are those?

23:52.871 --> 23:54.872
So, the translation sa...

23:56.874 --> 23:58.073
What just happened?

23:58.075 --> 24:00.208
Your stupid box
just skewered my finger.

24:00.210 --> 24:03.082
- <i>What the hell did you do?</i>
- I didn't do anything.

24:05.816 --> 24:07.282
All right,
the translation says:

24:07.284 --> 24:10.488
- "blood of the six."
- Blood of the six what?

24:10.955 --> 24:13.022
Well... there's six of us.

24:13.024 --> 24:15.226
Blood of the six of us?

24:16.093 --> 24:17.292
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

24:17.294 --> 24:19.965
Of course he's not serious!

24:21.032 --> 24:22.965
David, tell her
you're not serious.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.169
Look, I'm just saying...

24:24.835 --> 24:26.369
The Latin means
blood of the six.

24:26.371 --> 24:27.969
There are six of us

24:27.971 --> 24:29.871
and there are six of
those prickly things.

24:29.873 --> 24:33.141
Maybe your dad rigged the box
as some sort of identity check.

24:33.143 --> 24:35.980
You know, so only
the right people have access.

24:36.848 --> 24:38.884
Like a blood test
that checks DNA.

24:39.383 --> 24:40.983
It's a long shot!

24:40.985 --> 24:42.987
But what the hell,
it's just a prick of blood.

24:45.923 --> 24:47.058
Ouch!

24:47.324 --> 24:49.160
If it helps get us some answers.

24:51.595 --> 24:52.864
Why me?

24:53.130 --> 24:54.533
I'm not even related.

24:55.065 --> 24:56.869
But we're gonna be, babe.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.303
<i>Do it for me.</i>

25:11.882 --> 25:13.017
Absolutely not.

25:13.284 --> 25:15.286
No, no. No way.

25:15.887 --> 25:17.019
Michelle.

25:17.021 --> 25:18.353
If I let my brain
get in the way,

25:18.355 --> 25:20.956
- I'll never do this. So come on.
- There you go.

25:20.958 --> 25:23.292
- Come on, get this over with.
- Ok, ok, ok.

25:23.294 --> 25:26.195
- All right. Watch, with me.
- What are we doing?

25:26.197 --> 25:29.935
One, two, three, you and me.

25:30.301 --> 25:32.037
One, two, three.

25:33.571 --> 25:34.939
Jackpot!

25:36.207 --> 25:37.242
<i>My God!</i>

25:39.910 --> 25:41.913
So the will is a bar of gold?

25:42.179 --> 25:43.215
Oh, Teddy.

25:46.316 --> 25:47.318
This is real.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.453
- David, you've got a scale?
- Yeah. Kitchen.

25:50.455 --> 25:52.191
Second cabinet, second shelf.

25:53.925 --> 25:55.928
This is worth
a lot of money, you guys.

25:56.194 --> 25:59.364
- Where the hell are you going?
- Relax, Darren, I've got this.

26:01.064 --> 26:03.601
So, the price
of gold per ounce...

26:04.601 --> 26:07.235
This thing could be worth
like $500,000 dollars,

26:07.237 --> 26:08.273
maybe even more!

26:12.610 --> 26:15.211
God dammit! It burned me!

26:16.113 --> 26:17.245
<i>What happened?</i>

26:17.247 --> 26:18.281
David, do you have
a medical kit?

26:18.283 --> 26:19.351
Yeah.

26:20.150 --> 26:21.620
Glad I didn't pick it up.

26:22.085 --> 26:24.288
I got it, I'm calling
the lawyer right now.

26:27.691 --> 26:28.993
<i>Let me see, let me see.</i>

26:29.360 --> 26:31.359
Here, try some of this.
Disinfectant...

26:31.361 --> 26:33.262
- <i>Did you know about this?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

26:33.264 --> 26:35.097
It's not even going to
voicemail, it's just ringing!

26:35.099 --> 26:36.365
You're the one who knew
how to open the box!

26:36.367 --> 26:39.001
No, I didn't! I just guessed,
like everybody.

26:39.003 --> 26:40.369
<i>What are you saying, man?
Your dad did this?</i>

26:40.371 --> 26:42.638
Ok, this looks really bad,
it could be toxic.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.639
I need to take you
to the ER, ok? Let's go.

26:44.641 --> 26:46.978
Michelle, let me know
how this plays out!

26:47.178 --> 26:49.278
Can't we just like,
wash it off and sell it?

26:49.280 --> 26:51.013
No, no.
Nobody does anything

26:51.015 --> 26:53.118
until I get a hold
of the lawyer, ok?

26:53.383 --> 26:54.986
Let me know how it goes.

26:55.687 --> 26:57.255
Come on, babe. We gotta go.

27:05.396 --> 27:07.128
It doesn't hurt anymore.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.465
Well, that doesn't mean
it's not serious, we...

27:09.467 --> 27:11.169
Shh... go sit down, Cheryl.

27:13.036 --> 27:14.206
We're staying.

27:54.344 --> 27:56.180
Oh my God, it changed again!

27:59.182 --> 28:01.185
Maybe it's some kind of puzzle,

28:02.152 --> 28:03.322
or something.

28:04.354 --> 28:07.191
David, you're good at puzzles,
what do you think?

28:09.494 --> 28:10.495
David?

28:12.196 --> 28:13.332
<i>Where did he go?</i>

28:14.332 --> 28:15.333
David?

28:19.070 --> 28:20.205
David?

28:37.522 --> 28:39.224
Did you see where he went?

28:40.390 --> 28:41.360
No.

28:42.361 --> 28:43.426
Michelle, I wanted to tell you
that I know now

28:43.428 --> 28:46.361
what a terrible mistake
I made when I left you.

28:46.363 --> 28:48.432
Oh God, excuse me,
you're engaged.

28:49.233 --> 28:50.369
Michelle.

28:50.802 --> 28:52.236
Cheryl wanted this, not me.

28:52.503 --> 28:55.439
I see you now, and I just
realize what I threw away.

28:59.643 --> 29:01.112
Rich, don't...

29:03.514 --> 29:04.783
All I'm saying is,

29:05.315 --> 29:07.518
I realize now
that you're the one, Michelle.

29:09.586 --> 29:11.255
We were young,

29:11.823 --> 29:13.324
that was the problem.

29:15.459 --> 29:18.329
No, we were young,
and that's why it was so great.

29:21.865 --> 29:24.035
I think we just got distracted,

29:24.534 --> 29:26.537
and stopped appreciating
each other.

29:27.138 --> 29:29.408
But now I'm older,
and I know what I want.

29:30.541 --> 29:32.243
And if I had a choice,

29:33.274 --> 29:36.148
I'd spend every last day
on this Earth with you.

29:37.547 --> 29:38.549
<i>Richard?</i>

29:39.851 --> 29:41.218
How's your hand?

29:46.423 --> 29:47.458
It's good.

29:47.824 --> 29:49.561
<i>We should still
have it looked at.</i>

30:06.576 --> 30:07.578
David?

30:27.532 --> 30:28.600
David?

30:44.247 --> 30:46.150
David, I know
this is hard for you,

30:46.617 --> 30:50.555
but let's just try to get
through this afternoon, ok?

31:07.505 --> 31:08.506
He's here!

31:10.707 --> 31:12.244
Oh, God.

31:13.643 --> 31:14.678
Who is here?

31:15.713 --> 31:17.382
I've seen the box before.

31:17.915 --> 31:19.281
<i>In dad's study.</i>

31:19.283 --> 31:20.519
<i>Back when we were kids.</i>

31:21.319 --> 31:23.388
And two weeks
after he brought it in,

31:23.653 --> 31:24.688
mom died.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.334
I know that having everybody
here is very stressful for you...

31:39.336 --> 31:40.571
I'm not fucking crazy!

31:41.938 --> 31:43.408
I didn't say you were.

31:43.975 --> 31:45.209
I see things,

31:46.343 --> 31:48.679
things other people don't see,
little details that...

31:49.313 --> 31:51.416
that swim around
in my brain in a loop.

31:51.983 --> 31:53.552
Like the tapping fingers.

31:57.554 --> 32:01.290
And now, Rich,
I'm telling you, he's changed.

32:01.292 --> 32:03.692
Something about him is off.

32:03.694 --> 32:05.293
Of course, there is.

32:05.295 --> 32:06.965
I attract dysfunctional people.

32:07.364 --> 32:10.434
- You're not listening to me!
- I am! I get it!

32:12.570 --> 32:14.706
How would you know? You left.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.707
It got worse.

32:17.307 --> 32:19.376
You have no idea
what he was doing to me.

32:19.576 --> 32:21.579
I heard the screams
from your room.

32:22.846 --> 32:26.514
And I just sat there,
like a scared little boy,

32:26.516 --> 32:29.587
and I hated myself for that.

32:35.325 --> 32:36.727
Do you want everyone to leave?

32:40.331 --> 32:41.498
Is that what you want?

32:50.874 --> 32:52.808
What the hell?

32:52.810 --> 32:55.380
- I'm so sorry, I...
- Really, David?

32:55.612 --> 32:56.480
Really?

32:57.648 --> 32:59.751
- I'm going to take a shower!
- Michelle!

33:01.485 --> 33:02.717
We have no idea

33:02.719 --> 33:04.619
what your hand came
into contact with, babe.

33:04.621 --> 33:07.555
I don't know why you keep
insisting there's a problem.

33:07.557 --> 33:10.361
My hand is fine, look.

33:11.361 --> 33:13.361
- Oh, my God!
- I'm gonna have a shower.

33:13.363 --> 33:14.663
Michelle,
please don't use my...

33:14.665 --> 33:16.564
I know that you have
a guest bathroom,

33:16.566 --> 33:17.800
I will use that one, ok?

33:17.802 --> 33:19.501
And I promise,

33:19.503 --> 33:21.306
I will clean it up
perfectly afterwards, ok?

33:21.639 --> 33:23.574
Michelle, I'm really sorry.

33:27.511 --> 33:29.648
Woah! Look at that.

33:30.648 --> 33:32.516
That's definitely not gold.

33:33.516 --> 33:34.649
What the hell is it?

33:34.651 --> 33:35.516
Oh, no.

33:35.518 --> 33:38.689
Oh, no, no, no.

33:41.458 --> 33:42.791
No, no, no, this must be clean.

33:42.793 --> 33:44.659
One, two, three,
it must be clean.

33:44.661 --> 33:46.794
- No, must be clean!
- David!

33:46.796 --> 33:47.830
It has to be clean!

33:52.803 --> 33:55.306
David, I need you
to take a deep breath,

33:55.573 --> 33:57.939
I'm gonna remove you
from this room, right now.

33:57.941 --> 33:59.544
Ok? Let's go.

34:30.706 --> 34:32.110
What are you looking at?

34:32.742 --> 34:34.712
I'm looking at you, bitch.

34:36.447 --> 34:38.114
You're a good-looking kid,
Darren.

34:38.715 --> 34:41.485
Why don't you save it
for the child bride, huh?

34:42.887 --> 34:44.121
What the fuck, man?

34:44.789 --> 34:46.889
I got your attention now,
motherfucker?

34:48.525 --> 34:49.860
<i>You do it for money, right?</i>

34:50.460 --> 34:51.596
What?

34:54.931 --> 34:58.736
- What the fuck is your problem?
- I asked you a question, junkie.

34:59.135 --> 35:00.671
I know you need some money.

35:01.872 --> 35:02.874
Come out to my car.

35:04.474 --> 35:05.809
I could use a good release.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.749
I'm gonna tell Cheryl!

35:15.485 --> 35:17.488
You think
she's gonna believe you?

35:18.889 --> 35:19.890
A degenerate?

35:20.624 --> 35:21.760
Smart-ass?

35:22.626 --> 35:23.695
Little drug addict?

35:24.195 --> 35:25.563
Over me?

35:26.497 --> 35:27.665
Good old Rich?

35:28.898 --> 35:29.900
Twenty bucks.

35:30.501 --> 35:31.669
Anytime.

35:33.037 --> 35:34.805
Here's your deposit, punk.

36:10.673 --> 36:11.809
Hey, amigo?

36:12.543 --> 36:13.745
Hey man, it's Darren.

36:14.577 --> 36:15.746
Yeah, yeah.

36:17.548 --> 36:18.950
Nothing, you know, just...

36:20.284 --> 36:21.686
just with family shit.

36:22.952 --> 36:25.689
Yeah. Yeah, hey look,

36:25.956 --> 36:26.990
can I come by?

36:27.624 --> 36:29.827
In like an hour or so.

36:31.227 --> 36:33.729
No, no, no, see, I really...

36:33.731 --> 36:35.633
fucking need a hit right now.

36:40.637 --> 36:42.840
I know, I know,
I know I owe you money.

36:43.773 --> 36:46.577
But I'm paying you
this time, ok?

36:48.579 --> 36:51.783
I've got something
that's worth a lot of money,

36:53.651 --> 36:55.986
I'm just gonna figure out
how to open it first.

39:11.889 --> 39:13.024
<i>What the hell?</i>

39:29.740 --> 39:30.875
<i>Rich!</i>

39:34.177 --> 39:35.813
What are you doing here?

39:36.747 --> 39:38.149
I didn't mean to startle you.

39:39.282 --> 39:40.751
Well, you failed.

39:46.222 --> 39:48.892
I think about you
all the time, Michelle.

39:50.793 --> 39:52.763
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

40:00.838 --> 40:02.169
Come on, come on, come on.

40:02.171 --> 40:03.171
We can't, we can't.

40:03.173 --> 40:05.443
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

40:16.486 --> 40:17.854
Come on!

40:28.831 --> 40:30.000
<i>No.</i>

40:46.483 --> 40:48.820
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

40:53.557 --> 40:55.159
I don't wanna do this anymore.

40:58.561 --> 40:59.963
It's ok.

41:00.831 --> 41:01.966
You don't have to.

41:05.968 --> 41:08.840
You know, I used to think
it wasn't safe out there.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.143
But now, it's not safe in here.

41:18.247 --> 41:20.851
We shouldn't...
We shouldn't do this.

41:27.157 --> 41:28.191
Oh, Michelle.

41:32.262 --> 41:33.264
We can't do this.

41:34.530 --> 41:37.267
Come back to me. Come back.

41:42.005 --> 41:44.876
What is it? Stop! Not so hard!

41:45.309 --> 41:46.874
Let go!

41:46.876 --> 41:48.545
- Get off!
- You know you like it.

41:49.546 --> 41:50.912
- Stop it!
- Snowflake!

41:50.914 --> 41:53.184
- Stop it!
- You know you like it!

42:08.164 --> 42:11.101
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus! What happened?

42:12.568 --> 42:13.934
For fuck's sakes!

42:24.314 --> 42:25.316
Come on!

42:37.927 --> 42:39.063
Go!

42:40.264 --> 42:41.229
Come on!

42:41.231 --> 42:44.999
No, no, no!
God, fucking hell!

42:45.001 --> 42:46.938
No, no, no!

42:47.336 --> 42:49.004
Fuck! What?

42:49.006 --> 42:51.943
No! What the fuck?

43:10.360 --> 43:11.394
No.

43:21.371 --> 43:24.140
No, no, no!

43:26.709 --> 43:28.311
David, call 911 right now!

43:29.111 --> 43:31.282
I need another towel
to stop the bleeding!

43:34.184 --> 43:35.983
Jesus Christ, baby, it's ok.

43:35.985 --> 43:39.053
- It's ok, I'm right here, babe.
- Yeah, it's an emergency!

43:39.055 --> 43:40.655
- Put it on speaker!
- <i>This is 911.</i>

43:40.657 --> 43:41.990
I have a male, mid-40s,

43:41.992 --> 43:44.124
laceration
to the carotid artery,

43:44.126 --> 43:46.193
and he's hemorrhaging
really, really badly.

43:46.195 --> 43:47.662
<i>Is his head elevated?</i>

43:47.664 --> 43:49.330
Yes! Kelly,
in the back seat of my car,

43:49.332 --> 43:50.664
there's a medical kit
in the black tool bag,

43:50.666 --> 43:52.002
go get it, right now!

43:52.269 --> 43:54.005
Oh shit, I need your hand.

43:54.204 --> 43:56.037
Fuck baby.
David, go get the bag!

43:56.039 --> 43:57.071
Richard, oh my God!

43:57.073 --> 43:58.439
Black medical bag, go!

43:58.441 --> 44:01.144
<i>Can I have your location?
Paramedics have been called.</i>

44:09.418 --> 44:10.420
God dammit!

44:13.023 --> 44:14.155
Come on!

44:14.157 --> 44:16.227
<i>David, hurry up!
He's bleeding out!</i>

44:17.427 --> 44:18.428
I can't.

44:20.197 --> 44:21.428
<i>Keep pressure on the wound.</i>

44:21.430 --> 44:23.465
<i>Can you tell me
exactly what's happening?</i>

44:23.467 --> 44:26.037
Where the fuck
is my medical bag?

44:28.070 --> 44:30.040
I'll go get it, I'll go get it.

44:31.173 --> 44:33.475
It's ok, it's ok, Rich.
It's ok, I'm right here.

44:33.477 --> 44:35.075
You're gonna be fine,

44:35.077 --> 44:37.113
I just need you to stay
with me, ok, babe?

44:38.048 --> 44:39.350
It's ok. It's ok.

44:41.251 --> 44:43.321
- Where did you go?
- Nowhere.

44:51.193 --> 44:52.329
Stay with me, baby.

44:54.363 --> 44:56.499
Oh, God! He's going
into cardiac arrest.

45:21.490 --> 45:22.492
What the fuck?

46:12.409 --> 46:13.410
No way!

46:17.414 --> 46:20.347
<i>Hello? Hello? Please,
tell me what's happening.</i>

46:20.349 --> 46:22.149
<i>Ma'am, I need you
to talk to me.</i>

46:22.151 --> 46:23.287
<i>Here.</i>

46:30.360 --> 46:31.626
Oh, God!

46:31.628 --> 46:33.461
<i>Ma'am, hello? Please,
tell me what's happening.</i>

46:33.463 --> 46:35.566
<i>Paramedics will be there
in 20 minutes.</i>

46:48.211 --> 46:49.343
I'm so sorry.

46:49.345 --> 46:51.381
<i>Ma'am, are you still there?</i>

46:52.314 --> 46:53.450
It's too late!

46:54.316 --> 46:56.186
<i>He's fucking dead!</i>

46:56.586 --> 46:58.488
Baby, I'm so sorry.

47:06.195 --> 47:08.598
Oh my God, oh my God!

47:09.398 --> 47:13.200
Kelly. Can you please
go find Michelle's clothes?

47:13.202 --> 47:14.371
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

47:16.338 --> 47:17.604
- Cheryl
- I'm so sorry, baby!

47:17.606 --> 47:20.207
Cheryl, I know, but listen...
listen, honey,

47:20.209 --> 47:22.343
we gotta wash
your hand now, ok?

47:22.345 --> 47:23.745
Come on, let's get
this blood off,

47:23.747 --> 47:26.517
- let's get you up.
- What were you doing in here?

47:26.916 --> 47:28.483
I'm talking to you, bitch!

47:28.485 --> 47:30.517
What the fuck were you doing
in here with him?

47:30.519 --> 47:33.356
- I wasn't doing anything.
- Were you fucking him?

47:33.622 --> 47:36.626
- I was taking a shower.
- Were you fucking him?

47:36.892 --> 47:39.362
He came in...

47:40.229 --> 47:42.532
he came in.

47:46.436 --> 47:48.506
- I didn't...
- Oh, my God!

47:54.376 --> 47:55.678
I'm going to get dressed.

48:09.925 --> 48:11.294
Come on.

48:13.563 --> 48:14.564
All right.

48:16.332 --> 48:18.168
What do I do now?

48:18.535 --> 48:20.401
We're gonna wash your hands, ok?

48:20.403 --> 48:22.003
We're gonna make it
nice and easy.

48:22.005 --> 48:24.307
One, two, three.

48:24.673 --> 48:25.675
That's it.

48:26.309 --> 48:27.541
Come on.

48:27.543 --> 48:28.675
Let's rinse.

48:28.677 --> 48:31.681
One, two, three.

48:32.282 --> 48:33.450
<i>That's it, keep going.</i>

48:34.284 --> 48:37.287
<i>One, two, three.</i>

48:37.686 --> 48:40.356
<i>One, two, three.</i>

48:44.293 --> 48:46.494
You're going to be ok,
all right?

48:46.496 --> 48:48.465
You're going to be ok,
I promise.

48:50.432 --> 48:51.432
Keep going.

48:51.434 --> 48:54.305
One, two, three.

49:02.579 --> 49:04.648
We called 911,
they'll send the police.

49:04.981 --> 49:06.450
Paramedics will come.

49:06.650 --> 49:07.718
David!

49:08.584 --> 49:10.320
It's ok, just...

49:12.722 --> 49:14.325
He tried to kill me.

49:14.624 --> 49:15.659
What?

49:17.459 --> 49:19.329
He called me snowflake.

49:22.331 --> 49:24.731
Did you tell him that's
what dad called you?

49:24.733 --> 49:25.735
No.

49:26.836 --> 49:29.470
- And you didn't believe me.
- What are you saying?

49:29.472 --> 49:30.640
That it's a ghost?

49:31.340 --> 49:32.673
I don't know.
What would you say?

49:32.675 --> 49:35.678
Somebody must have
known about it,

49:36.479 --> 49:37.544
and told him.

49:37.546 --> 49:40.351
I mean, that is the one thing
that makes any sense.

49:49.559 --> 49:52.660
Hey, I think
we should all go home,

49:52.662 --> 49:55.432
and reconvene at a later date.

49:55.764 --> 49:56.766
No.

49:57.434 --> 49:59.503
You are not going anywhere.

49:59.702 --> 50:00.771
You killed him.

50:01.503 --> 50:03.504
Excuse me? He attacked me.

50:03.506 --> 50:05.840
You'll tell the police
when they get here.

50:05.842 --> 50:07.508
I beg your pardon?

50:07.510 --> 50:10.644
You can tell it to the police
when they get here!

50:10.646 --> 50:12.379
You don't know what happened.

50:14.517 --> 50:16.053
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

50:17.653 --> 50:20.523
It was my dad, and he's dead,
and thank God for that!

50:20.789 --> 50:23.390
Now, I want you to take
this fucking thing

50:23.392 --> 50:24.794
and get the fuck
out of my house!

50:27.530 --> 50:28.465
You know...

50:32.535 --> 50:34.471
you guys have the box
all wrong.

50:37.807 --> 50:39.740
- It gives you what you need.
- Darren!

50:39.742 --> 50:42.542
Are you so high right now
that you don't even know

50:42.544 --> 50:45.081
that Rich just dropped down
on the bathroom floor?

50:45.814 --> 50:46.849
Yeah.

50:47.416 --> 50:48.718
His body wasn't so strong.

50:49.552 --> 50:50.718
Weak heart.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.755
Poor liver.

50:52.488 --> 50:53.687
Definitely not a keeper.

50:53.689 --> 50:55.555
- What is wrong with you?
- Darren!

50:55.557 --> 50:57.158
I am so sick of your bullshit.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.559
You know what? Call a cab!

50:58.561 --> 50:59.827
I'm out of here.

50:59.829 --> 51:02.629
I'm sorry, Michelle,
Cheryl, David, I'm sorry.

51:02.631 --> 51:03.800
Don't forget your keys!

51:17.713 --> 51:18.715
What?

51:22.718 --> 51:23.720
Guys!

51:26.456 --> 51:27.758
Guys, get out here!

51:30.660 --> 51:32.596
Michelle! Look at this.

51:32.928 --> 51:34.131
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

51:34.530 --> 51:35.865
<i>It's the middle of the day.</i>

51:40.202 --> 51:43.470
Guys, the cars are gone,
and there's no stars in the sky!

51:43.472 --> 51:44.675
Someone stole my car?

51:48.744 --> 51:50.613
Wait a second, what is that?

51:53.682 --> 51:54.885
Michelle, what is that?

51:57.486 --> 51:58.686
<i>Hey, guys?</i>

51:58.688 --> 52:00.791
<i>Guys, I think you should
come back in now.</i>

52:02.758 --> 52:04.427
Come back in the house.

52:05.528 --> 52:06.897
Get back in the house, now!

52:08.932 --> 52:10.167
Kelly!

52:10.900 --> 52:11.934
Come on!

52:14.637 --> 52:15.773
I'm calling 911.

52:20.642 --> 52:21.644
There's no signal.

52:22.778 --> 52:25.245
It's ridiculous, you get
great signal strength up here.

52:25.247 --> 52:26.646
Well, the paramedics are coming,

52:26.648 --> 52:27.849
they'll know what's
happening, right?

52:27.851 --> 52:29.249
There has to be some
logical explanation

52:29.251 --> 52:30.553
about what happened out there.

52:30.820 --> 52:32.923
Why aren't you
concerned about this?

52:34.858 --> 52:35.923
Well...

52:35.925 --> 52:37.791
you can live for
thousands of years

52:37.793 --> 52:40.530
and waste it all if you don't
enjoy the little moments.

52:40.729 --> 52:42.198
<i>Did you touch that box?</i>

52:43.666 --> 52:45.669
Did you take
something from the box?

52:47.202 --> 52:48.738
Maybe a little China, why?

52:49.939 --> 52:50.974
You know...

52:51.541 --> 52:53.709
you always were the smart one.

52:54.276 --> 52:56.546
<i>The one I had to keep my eye on</i>

52:57.546 --> 52:58.849
Weren't you, Brown Nose?

53:01.851 --> 53:03.619
What did you just call me?

53:05.755 --> 53:07.555
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

53:07.557 --> 53:08.725
<i>My God.</i>

53:09.959 --> 53:10.994
<i>Is everyone ok?</i>

53:12.762 --> 53:14.597
David, do you have candles?

53:15.965 --> 53:19.233
Yeah, I've got some candles
and a backup generator.

53:19.235 --> 53:20.570
Follow me.

53:23.572 --> 53:25.608
Wait! Can you stay with me?

53:25.974 --> 53:27.844
Please, I'm scared.

53:29.579 --> 53:30.747
Really?

53:32.115 --> 53:33.584
Fine.

53:37.586 --> 53:38.855
Ok, candles are in here.

53:39.988 --> 53:41.592
I've got a generator.

53:42.592 --> 53:44.591
I'm gonna go put these
around the house.

53:44.593 --> 53:45.729
Yeah.

53:52.668 --> 53:54.270
- What?
- Come here, please.

53:54.736 --> 53:56.005
I just wanna talk to you.

53:56.872 --> 53:57.907
What?

53:59.675 --> 54:01.274
How are you even
thinking right now?

54:01.276 --> 54:03.878
- Aren't you scared?
- Of course I'm scared.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.613
I'm just a little more
used to it than you are.

54:06.615 --> 54:07.914
- You're very pretty.
- Darren!

54:07.916 --> 54:09.617
I really need you
to pull it together.

54:09.619 --> 54:10.952
It's gonna be one of us.

54:10.954 --> 54:13.023
Or is it gonna be me,
or is it gonna be you?

54:14.890 --> 54:16.760
Guess it's gonna be me, then.

54:22.631 --> 54:23.633
Help me!

54:24.534 --> 54:26.903
- You know... you talk too much.
- Help!

54:34.043 --> 54:36.046
You're gonna like
what comes next.

54:37.847 --> 54:39.981
Guys, help me!
He's trying to kill me!

54:39.983 --> 54:41.952
- What happened?
- He's gone crazy!

54:42.352 --> 54:43.783
Hello, snowflake!

54:43.785 --> 54:45.785
We didn't get to finish
in the shower.

54:45.787 --> 54:47.791
- Brown Nose.
- Fuck you!

54:49.057 --> 54:51.695
- Come on! I got what I want!
- Stop it!

54:56.666 --> 54:57.801
Hey, asshole!

55:02.872 --> 55:04.041
<i>What the fuck?</i>

55:04.874 --> 55:06.076
<i>Everybody, stay back!</i>

55:07.110 --> 55:09.345
<i>Oh, my God, what's happening?</i>

55:10.079 --> 55:11.981
<i>What's happening?</i>

55:14.082 --> 55:16.983
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, God.</i>

55:16.985 --> 55:17.987
No!

55:19.088 --> 55:20.090
Darren!

55:20.822 --> 55:22.825
Don't touch him. Come on.

55:24.727 --> 55:26.997
- All right.
- What is happening?

55:27.363 --> 55:28.698
I don't know.

55:28.997 --> 55:30.867
Nobody touch him!

55:31.901 --> 55:33.637
Now, let's think about this.

55:34.102 --> 55:36.037
They both took something
from the box,

55:36.039 --> 55:38.909
- now they're both dead.
- They both called me Snowflake.

55:39.709 --> 55:42.843
Whoever did this knew that Rich
was gonna go for the gold,

55:42.845 --> 55:44.648
and Darren would go
for the drugs.

55:45.113 --> 55:47.981
So, what are you saying?
That dad laid a trap,

55:47.983 --> 55:50.117
and now it's gonna
kill all of us?

55:50.119 --> 55:52.852
- I mean, why would he do that?
- This is impossible.

55:52.854 --> 55:55.122
And Richard's hand
was burnt with acid,

55:55.124 --> 55:56.724
it was burnt!

55:56.726 --> 55:58.392
And then it was healed?
That's not possible.

55:58.394 --> 55:59.630
She's right.

55:59.861 --> 56:01.262
We have to be
logical about this,

56:01.264 --> 56:04.064
cause there has to be some sort
of real world explanation.

56:04.066 --> 56:06.800
Cause I don't believe in spirits
and hauntings,

56:06.802 --> 56:07.871
and all that bullshit.

56:08.137 --> 56:10.006
This feels like a set up to me.

56:10.872 --> 56:12.141
<i>Who could have done that?</i>

56:12.941 --> 56:14.774
- You could.
- What?

56:14.776 --> 56:16.943
You're an architect,
you know how things look!

56:16.945 --> 56:19.079
- You could have made that box!
- That's insane.

56:19.081 --> 56:20.881
And the lawyer's calls,
all had us come here,

56:20.883 --> 56:23.050
but we never met a lawyer!
It could have been you!

56:23.052 --> 56:25.919
And that box just magically
shows up on your door step?

56:25.921 --> 56:27.153
There was no delivery truck!

56:27.155 --> 56:28.823
It could have been here
the whole time!

56:28.825 --> 56:30.024
<i>And then all of us
received that e-mail</i>

56:30.026 --> 56:31.791
as soon as you walked back
in the room.

56:31.793 --> 56:32.992
Maybe you sent it!

56:32.994 --> 56:34.794
Right, and what about the blood
and the sign out on the sky?

56:34.796 --> 56:36.162
Did he do that too? Come on!

56:36.164 --> 56:37.798
You're so screwed up.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.166
You're so screwed up
because you're stuck here.

56:39.168 --> 56:41.102
And you're angry at the world,
and you're angry at us,

56:41.104 --> 56:42.269
because we all have
normal lives,

56:42.271 --> 56:44.805
and you finally got a chance
to get us all under your roof!

56:44.807 --> 56:46.907
- Enough already!
- Ok, so what, Kelly?

56:46.909 --> 56:49.175
I came up with this crazy plan
to kill everybody.

56:49.177 --> 56:51.111
- It's ridiculous.
- I represent people

56:51.113 --> 56:53.079
who do it every day.
Every day!

56:53.081 --> 56:54.981
Right, cause I'm just
the crazy one, right?

56:54.983 --> 56:56.983
I'm not like all of you,
like the rich asshole,

56:56.985 --> 56:59.455
or your junky brother
with a bitch lawyer.

56:59.856 --> 57:00.991
Stop! Guys, please!

57:01.189 --> 57:03.927
We have to stay together, ok?
We can't fight.

57:05.193 --> 57:06.195
I'm sorry.

57:07.063 --> 57:09.095
Kelly, I didn't kill anybody.

57:09.097 --> 57:11.097
- Well, I'm not dying here.
- Neither am I.

57:11.099 --> 57:13.867
My God, neither are any of us,
for shit's sake!

57:13.869 --> 57:15.202
You know what? She's right.

57:15.204 --> 57:17.807
- I'll take my chances out there.
- Michelle!

57:18.140 --> 57:19.809
What is that?

57:20.809 --> 57:21.945
Oh, my God.

57:22.278 --> 57:23.814
Is it a rock?

57:24.814 --> 57:25.945
What is it?

57:25.947 --> 57:27.150
- It's cold.
- It's everywhere.

57:27.849 --> 57:29.018
What's that smell?

57:35.291 --> 57:37.961
For God's sake,
just open the damn thing!

57:40.095 --> 57:42.095
How can someone do this
to your house?

57:42.097 --> 57:43.830
Come on! Everybody, push!

57:43.832 --> 57:45.235
One, two, three!

57:47.135 --> 57:48.903
Oh, my God, what is happening?

57:48.905 --> 57:51.108
Somebody tell me
what's going on, please!

57:53.142 --> 57:55.542
- Can we burn it down?
- No, we can't burn it!

57:55.544 --> 57:56.977
Then we'd burn
the whole house down!

57:56.979 --> 57:58.982
You still think
I'm trying to kill you?

58:00.515 --> 58:02.983
No, no, no, no.
You said not to touch that!

58:02.985 --> 58:04.050
Look, whatever is
happening out there,

58:04.052 --> 58:06.153
it's connected to this box.
We gotta find a way in.

58:06.155 --> 58:07.988
We gotta find a latch,
or a hinge, or something.

58:07.990 --> 58:10.794
I shouldn't be here,
I shouldn't be here.

58:11.126 --> 58:13.593
He's right,
there is a seam here, maybe...

58:13.595 --> 58:14.995
Here, here, here.

58:14.997 --> 58:16.767
Good thinking.
Yeah, yeah, right there.

58:20.869 --> 58:22.005
<i>Push harder!</i>

58:23.539 --> 58:24.874
Guys!

58:25.273 --> 58:27.274
Guys!

58:28.878 --> 58:30.910
Ok, this scratch
was not here before.

58:30.912 --> 58:32.048
Kelly, go back!

58:32.881 --> 58:34.184
<i>Scratch again, same place.</i>

58:36.017 --> 58:37.153
- Ok.
- <i>Now.</i>

58:41.557 --> 58:42.923
Oh, my God.

58:42.925 --> 58:44.024
What does this mean?

58:44.026 --> 58:45.225
What are you thinking?

58:45.227 --> 58:46.926
You don't wanna know
what I'm thinking,

58:46.928 --> 58:48.562
'cause what I'm thinking
is not possible.

58:48.564 --> 58:51.568
Kelly! Other side of the box,
scratch it when I tell you.

58:54.936 --> 58:56.972
Ok, Kelly! Now!

59:00.309 --> 59:02.245
What is happening, guys?

59:02.577 --> 59:03.913
What is happening?

59:05.113 --> 59:06.247
Are we in hell?

59:06.249 --> 59:07.914
I've been in hell
most of my life,

59:07.916 --> 59:09.115
and I managed to survive it.

59:09.117 --> 59:10.450
One day at a time.

59:10.452 --> 59:12.051
So, let's figure out
what kind of hell we're in,

59:12.053 --> 59:13.590
so we can get the hell out.

59:14.322 --> 59:17.124
All right, Kelly, I want you
to go back to the box,

59:17.126 --> 59:19.325
scrape in the exact same place
when I tell you.

59:19.327 --> 59:21.195
Please don't make me go
by myself.

59:21.197 --> 59:22.999
Ok, fine, I'll go. I'll go.

59:32.941 --> 59:35.242
When she scrapes,
where she scrapes,

59:35.244 --> 59:37.146
we're gonna try
and bust through.

59:37.613 --> 59:40.350
If that doesn't work,
I'm gonna smash the box.

59:43.218 --> 59:45.352
<i>Ok. It's gonna work.
It's gonna work, right?</i>

59:45.354 --> 59:48.088
- <i>It's gonna work?</i>
- <i>I promise you this will work.</i>

59:48.090 --> 59:49.423
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

59:49.425 --> 59:51.258
I don't know what to do.
I usually know what to do,

59:51.260 --> 59:52.693
and I don't know what to do now.

59:52.695 --> 59:54.128
Look at me. Look at me.

59:54.130 --> 59:56.365
Trust me, I'm gonna get us
out of here, ok?

59:57.099 --> 59:58.365
<i>I promise you,</i>

59:58.367 --> 01:00:00.233
- <i>I'm getting us out of here.</i>
- <i>Ok.</i>

01:00:00.235 --> 01:00:01.367
Everyone ok?

01:00:01.369 --> 01:00:02.404
Michelle!

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:08.979
Ready?

01:00:09.311 --> 01:00:10.380
<i>Now!</i>

01:00:46.682 --> 01:00:47.715
What?

01:00:47.717 --> 01:00:49.082
I don't understand.

01:00:49.084 --> 01:00:50.220
What is happening?

01:01:08.503 --> 01:01:10.039
Michelle!

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:13.176
Michelle?

01:01:15.043 --> 01:01:16.178
Michelle?

01:01:18.113 --> 01:01:19.349
Michelle, where are you?

01:01:20.383 --> 01:01:21.384
Michelle?

01:01:21.784 --> 01:01:23.720
- She's not here.
- <i>David!</i>

01:01:24.186 --> 01:01:26.323
- Michelle!
- <i>David, can you hear me?</i>

01:01:27.523 --> 01:01:30.356
- Where could she have gone?
- Hey, can you hear me?

01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:31.393
<i>Hey!</i>

01:01:33.061 --> 01:01:34.229
What?

01:01:38.066 --> 01:01:39.332
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:42.104
- <i>Hey! Guys!</i>
- Michelle?

01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:45.207
- <i>Over here!</i>
- Michelle!

01:01:46.342 --> 01:01:48.475
- <i>Are you able to hear me?</i>
- What the fuck?

01:01:48.477 --> 01:01:50.343
Is that a reflection?
I don't...

01:01:50.345 --> 01:01:52.079
- I don't know!
- Where is she?

01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:53.347
She's inside.

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:55.418
Hang on, Michelle,
we're gonna get you out, ok?

01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:56.753
<i>Help me!</i>

01:01:57.218 --> 01:01:59.289
How is she inside there?
Michelle!

01:02:00.088 --> 01:02:01.224
Can you hear me?

01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:04.160
Get me out of here!

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:06.095
Guys, get me out!

01:02:07.128 --> 01:02:09.298
- Get me out!
- Don't bang on the glass!

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:16.239
Michelle!

01:02:17.506 --> 01:02:20.243
- What happened to her?
- Did she just die?

01:02:20.543 --> 01:02:23.512
- Maybe she's not really gone!
- Is she here somewhere?

01:02:24.412 --> 01:02:27.150
Kelly, come here.
David, get away from there.

01:02:31.253 --> 01:02:32.389
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:02:34.122 --> 01:02:35.555
<i>Oh, my God, I killed her.</i>

01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:37.457
- <i>Kelly, you didn't kill her.</i>
- <i>No, it's my fault.</i>

01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:39.126
<i>I should have gone,
she went instead of me,</i>

01:02:39.128 --> 01:02:40.526
<i>if I would have gone
it wouldn't...</i>

01:02:40.528 --> 01:02:42.396
<i>David!</i>

01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:44.401
Come on, get away from there,
come on, it's not safe.

01:02:45.668 --> 01:02:49.039
I don't understand...
she was right there...

01:02:49.271 --> 01:02:51.140
she was... she was...

01:02:51.606 --> 01:02:54.276
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:02:59.548 --> 01:03:00.550
David.

01:03:02.818 --> 01:03:04.283
Look, I need you, ok?

01:03:04.285 --> 01:03:06.188
I need you to stay with me.

01:03:07.189 --> 01:03:08.555
So, what was it
that Darren said?

01:03:08.557 --> 01:03:12.294
The box gives you
what you want, when you need.

01:03:13.428 --> 01:03:14.564
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:15.564 --> 01:03:18.332
So, it's like
some kind of a trap.

01:03:18.334 --> 01:03:20.566
It gave Rich the gold,
Darren the drugs,

01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:22.301
and Michelle the mirror.

01:03:22.303 --> 01:03:24.437
It presents you with something
that you're attracted to,

01:03:24.439 --> 01:03:26.305
and you take it,
and it kills you.

01:03:26.307 --> 01:03:28.343
Do you know how crazy
that sounds?

01:03:28.711 --> 01:03:30.176
It's not crazy!

01:03:30.178 --> 01:03:31.577
It's like my therapist said,
right?

01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:34.881
I built my own trap here,
because my father was my world,

01:03:34.883 --> 01:03:37.517
and then my whole world
fell apart.

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:42.321
Right? And so, I created
this house to be my safe place.

01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:44.258
- Wait.
- What?

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.395
It's you!

01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:47.327
It's you!

01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:48.896
It explains why
we can't get out,

01:03:48.898 --> 01:03:50.597
the box is giving you
what you want!

01:03:50.599 --> 01:03:52.602
We're trapped
in your safe place!

01:03:52.867 --> 01:03:54.401
- <i>We can't leave.</i>
- What?

01:03:54.403 --> 01:03:55.605
<i>We're trapped? Why?</i>

01:03:56.338 --> 01:03:58.338
<i>What about us?
What about what we want?</i>

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.506
<i>This is crazy.</i>

01:03:59.508 --> 01:04:01.475
How does it know
what we want, David?

01:04:01.477 --> 01:04:03.343
The box is giving
you what you want.

01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:04.343
- No, no...
- Yes!

01:04:04.345 --> 01:04:06.213
That doesn't make any sense, ok?

01:04:06.215 --> 01:04:08.481
Because everybody got something
that they needed right?

01:04:08.483 --> 01:04:10.283
When they got it, they died.

01:04:10.285 --> 01:04:12.387
And obviously, I didn't die...

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:15.492
What?

01:04:17.927 --> 01:04:21.231
One, two, three, four.

01:04:22.363 --> 01:04:25.501
- One, two, three, four.
- David?

01:04:28.236 --> 01:04:29.635
I have counted between that post

01:04:29.637 --> 01:04:31.671
and this post
about 10,000 times,

01:04:31.673 --> 01:04:34.643
and I'm telling you,
it is always five paces.

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:37.646
- So?
- I just counted four.

01:04:47.322 --> 01:04:48.457
Watch out!

01:04:51.693 --> 01:04:52.928
Come on!

01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:57.332
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:02.269
Hey guys, look!
Maybe it's a way out!

01:05:02.271 --> 01:05:05.004
- Where does that lead to?
- It's a wall to the outside.

01:05:05.006 --> 01:05:06.539
But there's a light
coming through,

01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:08.677
so maybe it's a way out!
Come on, we have to try!

01:05:15.284 --> 01:05:16.452
What is happening?

01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:19.956
Just try and break through this!

01:05:21.557 --> 01:05:23.423
I thought you said
it was outside!

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:25.291
It's supposed to be the outside!

01:05:25.293 --> 01:05:27.696
- It used to be in my house!
- I don't care, it's a way out!

01:05:28.564 --> 01:05:30.329
David, come on, we gotta go!

01:05:30.331 --> 01:05:32.298
You have to leave your house
right now!

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.334
- I can't!
- I will be right here with you.

01:05:34.336 --> 01:05:35.705
Please, David, are you ready?

01:05:36.005 --> 01:05:37.336
One...

01:05:37.338 --> 01:05:38.507
- Two, three!
- Two, three!

01:05:47.015 --> 01:05:48.383
Are you ok?

01:05:49.651 --> 01:05:51.454
What is this place?

01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:06.001
- She's still warm.
- What?

01:06:06.735 --> 01:06:09.472
The blood is still wet,
this just happened!

01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:17.779
It's a school house.

01:06:19.615 --> 01:06:22.481
This is an order form,
that says it's 1953.

01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:23.619
That's impossible.

01:06:27.055 --> 01:06:28.423
Oh, my God!

01:06:38.901 --> 01:06:40.370
It followed us here?

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.707
Ok, maybe the box opened here,
like it did in my house,

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:50.376
and the same thing
that happened in my place,

01:06:50.378 --> 01:06:51.780
- happened here.
- That's crazy.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.784
All I know is I wanna get the
hell away from that thing.

01:07:04.059 --> 01:07:05.595
What do you want from us?

01:07:07.095 --> 01:07:08.463
There's a door here!

01:07:13.434 --> 01:07:14.603
Oh, my God!

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:15.936
No!

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:19.675
Where's Michelle?

01:07:20.575 --> 01:07:22.445
Give her back to us, please.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.546
Take me, it should have been me,

01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:28.818
take me instead, please.
Give her back to us.

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:41.831
- Michelle!
- <i>It's all yours now.</i>

01:07:49.704 --> 01:07:51.838
It's the same scratch
Kelly made in the box.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.711
- Doesn't make sense!
- Yes, it does.

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.443
What does that mean?

01:07:56.445 --> 01:07:57.847
I think we're still
inside the box.

01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.387
Kelly?

01:08:07.856 --> 01:08:08.890
What's wrong?

01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:12.462
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:08:13.595 --> 01:08:15.865
I think this is the way out,
guys, follow me.

01:08:34.148 --> 01:08:35.484
Kelly?

01:08:47.495 --> 01:08:48.662
Kelly?

01:08:49.831 --> 01:08:50.899
Come on.

01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:54.770
Kelly?

01:09:13.054 --> 01:09:14.523
Kelly.

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:16.792
What are you doing?

01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:19.728
You can see everything
from here.

01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:21.798
Are you ok?

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:23.865
Kelly?

01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:29.805
Pretty fucking cool, huh?

01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:45.955
Cheryl, hold on!

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.564
No!

01:09:57.566 --> 01:09:59.001
- David!
- Cheryl, I got you!

01:10:04.973 --> 01:10:06.609
- No!
- No!

01:10:19.054 --> 01:10:20.723
- <i>David!</i>
- Cheryl?

01:10:22.657 --> 01:10:23.793
Cheryl!

01:10:26.862 --> 01:10:27.897
Cheryl?

01:10:29.598 --> 01:10:31.267
David, what are you doing here?

01:10:33.335 --> 01:10:34.904
You need to be in the light.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.005
It hates the light!

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.675
It likes to live in the shadows.

01:10:42.143 --> 01:10:43.612
She's fast.

01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:48.750
She is the mother
and the father of all lies.

01:10:49.617 --> 01:10:50.919
She will seduce you,

01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:53.890
corrupt you,

01:10:54.923 --> 01:10:57.893
but she can't take you
unless you say yes.

01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:04.900
I am so sorry
for everything that's happened.

01:11:07.635 --> 01:11:08.771
It wasn't you?

01:11:09.638 --> 01:11:10.773
It never was.

01:11:13.909 --> 01:11:16.976
I have so many things
I wanna tell you.

01:11:16.978 --> 01:11:19.078
There's so many things
I wanna ask you.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.315
There's no time.

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.652
I'm the bird
in the belly of a cat.

01:11:25.954 --> 01:11:28.922
Who was forced
to witness everything,

01:11:28.924 --> 01:11:30.793
since you were a child.

01:11:33.728 --> 01:11:34.863
I missed...

01:11:36.665 --> 01:11:37.934
my brilliant boy...

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.102
- take on the world.
- Dad.

01:11:43.405 --> 01:11:44.807
Dad.

01:11:46.942 --> 01:11:49.946
Please, forgive me, David.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.848
I do.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:55.885
Cheryl?

01:11:57.952 --> 01:11:58.987
Cheryl?

01:11:59.888 --> 01:12:03.826
- Where are you?
- <i>David! Help me!</i>

01:12:04.358 --> 01:12:05.760
Cheryl!

01:12:07.362 --> 01:12:08.698
Cheryl!

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.099
David, help me!

01:12:13.168 --> 01:12:14.370
You let her go!

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.706
I said, you let her...

01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:26.745
Kelly!

01:12:26.747 --> 01:12:27.916
You let her go!

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:52.008
What are you?

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.410
Why are you always so determined
to give me a name?

01:13:15.162 --> 01:13:16.165
It's over.

01:13:19.768 --> 01:13:20.903
We did it.

01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:25.907
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:13:35.851 --> 01:13:37.085
Where did you get that?

01:13:42.057 --> 01:13:43.793
I'm so sorry, David.

01:13:44.793 --> 01:13:46.062
She was gonna kill you.

01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:52.934
The box gives you what you need.

01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:56.204
And when you open
your heart to it,

01:13:56.804 --> 01:13:57.939
I get in.

01:14:00.942 --> 01:14:03.212
This body is strong, but...

01:14:07.214 --> 01:14:08.015
she's lost, too.

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:13.088
Why do you people
fight me so hard, huh?

01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:15.256
What's gonna happen to her?

01:14:17.025 --> 01:14:19.862
You liked her, didn't you?

01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:23.098
I could tell from the moment
you saw her.

01:14:23.564 --> 01:14:25.134
She liked you too.

01:14:26.268 --> 01:14:28.971
You could stay with her here,
if you want.

01:14:30.972 --> 01:14:32.108
You're right.

01:14:34.509 --> 01:14:35.745
I do want her.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:39.115
- From the moment I saw her...
- David.

01:14:41.249 --> 01:14:42.251
David.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:44.853
You're the strongest one.

01:14:47.155 --> 01:14:48.189
That's funny.

01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:49.891
I'm the strong one.

01:14:51.259 --> 01:14:54.130
This is your chance
to be just like your daddy.

01:14:55.263 --> 01:14:56.999
I'm nothing like him.

01:14:58.866 --> 01:15:00.001
Do it.

01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:01.871
Do it.

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:08.543
No!

01:15:16.084 --> 01:15:19.889
No!

01:16:42.392 --> 01:16:47.392
