00:36.900 --> 00:39.300
Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

00:39.400 --> 00:40.800
It's O.K.! I'm here.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.800
Here we are!
It's all right.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.700
Set it down
nice and easy, huh?

00:44.810 --> 00:46.210
Yeah, sure,
at the impound.

00:46.310 --> 00:47.500
Next time,
read the sign.

00:47.610 --> 00:48.771
Hey, you don't
understand.

00:48.881 --> 00:50.781
Look, I'm just here
to meet my wife's plane.

00:50.881 --> 00:52.281
You got to let me
have this car.

00:52.381 --> 00:53.781
Yeah, sure, tomorrow,
8:00 to 4:00.

00:53.881 --> 00:55.281
You pay 40 bucks,
we give it back.

00:55.381 --> 00:56.651
Don't write it up.
Don't write it up.

00:56.751 --> 00:58.781
Come on, man. This is
my mother-in-law's car.

00:58.891 --> 01:01.761
She's already mad at me
'cause I'm not a dentist.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.831
Look, I'm a cop--
L.A.P.D.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.791
Oh, I was in L.A. once.
Hated it.

01:06.901 --> 01:07.791
Well, I can understand.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.061
I don't like it
much myself--Hey!

01:09.171 --> 01:11.692
That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

01:11.802 --> 01:13.832
Cut me some slack,
will you?

01:13.942 --> 01:15.402
Look, I used to be
a cop in New York City.

01:15.502 --> 01:18.062
I only moved to L.A.
because my wife took a job there.

01:18.172 --> 01:19.332
Come on.
What do you say?

01:19.442 --> 01:20.412
Here we are--

01:20.512 --> 01:22.742
Washington, D.C.,
the heart of democracy.

01:22.852 --> 01:24.642
One hand
washes the other.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.312
Come on, man.
It's Christmas.

01:26.422 --> 01:28.912
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.422
Merry Christmas, pal.

01:30.522 --> 01:33.923
It's all yours, Murray.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.423
Son of a bitch.

02:15.404 --> 02:16.835
Yeah, I know that,
Larry.

02:18.335 --> 02:20.735
Snow flurries along
the northeastern seaboard...

02:20.845 --> 02:22.865
Hi. Where are
the telephones?

02:22.975 --> 02:23.945
Right over there.

02:24.045 --> 02:25.405
Thank you very much.

02:25.515 --> 02:27.415
Thank you. Leonard Adkins
is in a warmer clime

02:27.515 --> 02:29.245
with a story that grows
hotter by the minute.

02:29.355 --> 02:31.755
Security was tight today
at Escalan Airport

02:31.855 --> 02:33.645
in the Republic
of Valverde

02:33.755 --> 02:35.745
where government
authorities report

02:35.855 --> 02:37.755
that deposed General
Ramon Esperanza

02:37.855 --> 02:40.126
will be delivered
for immediate extradition

02:40.226 --> 02:41.426
to the United States.

02:41.526 --> 02:43.056
Only two years ago,
General Esperanza

02:43.166 --> 02:44.756
led his country's army

02:44.866 --> 02:47.396
in a campaign against
Communist insurgents,

02:47.506 --> 02:50.266
a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

02:50.376 --> 02:52.276
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples

02:52.376 --> 02:54.346
not only in his country's
recent election,

02:54.446 --> 02:57.306
but closer to home,
as well,

02:57.416 --> 02:59.776
when high-ranking
Pentagon officials were charged

02:59.886 --> 03:02.647
with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

03:02.757 --> 03:05.217
But mounting evidence
that Esperanza's forces

03:05.317 --> 03:07.517
violated the neutrality
of neighboring countries

03:07.627 --> 03:09.787
made Congress
withhold funds,

03:09.897 --> 03:11.727
funds which Esperanza
is accused of replacing

03:11.827 --> 03:13.457
by going into
the lucrative business

03:13.567 --> 03:15.087
of cocaine smuggling.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.927
Although Esperanza was removed
as Commander In Chief

03:19.037 --> 03:20.507
earlier this year,

03:20.607 --> 03:23.227
the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday,

03:23.338 --> 03:24.598
and Washington
insiders say

03:24.708 --> 03:26.438
it was a phone call
that made it happen,

03:26.548 --> 03:27.738
a phone call
from a--

03:32.348 --> 03:34.748
All right, all right.

03:37.358 --> 03:39.258
If I could find a phone,

03:39.358 --> 03:41.258
I'd call you,
whoever you are.

04:12.590 --> 04:13.720
Bye.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.260
Excuse me.
Thank you.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.240
Yeah, this is
Lieutenant McClane.

04:26.340 --> 04:27.740
Somebody there
just beep me?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.500
I'd like to think
I'm somebody.

04:29.610 --> 04:31.201
Honey,
where are you?

04:31.311 --> 04:33.241
Did you land yet?

04:33.351 --> 04:35.251
It's the nineties,
remember?

04:35.351 --> 04:38.371
Microchips, microwaves,
faxes, airphones.

04:38.481 --> 04:41.251
Yeah, well, as far
as I'm concerned,

04:41.351 --> 04:43.341
progress peaked
with frozen pizza.

04:43.461 --> 04:45.251
Listen, um,
we're going to be

04:45.361 --> 04:47.261
about half an hour
late landing, O.K.?

04:47.361 --> 04:48.761
I just wanted
to let you know.

04:48.861 --> 04:50.231
The kids O.K.?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.262
Yeah, well, they're about
to lose their minds

04:52.362 --> 04:54.132
from all the sugar
your parents are giving them.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.262
Did Mom give you
a hard time

04:56.372 --> 04:57.772
about borrowing
her new car?

04:57.872 --> 04:59.532
No. Not yet.

04:59.642 --> 05:01.772
Listen, honey,
when you land,

05:01.872 --> 05:04.212
can we just, like,
you know, rent a car,

05:04.312 --> 05:06.212
check into a hotel,

05:06.312 --> 05:08.712
leave the kids
with your parents,

05:08.812 --> 05:10.252
order some room service?

05:10.352 --> 05:13.222
A bottle of champagne,
what do you say?

05:13.322 --> 05:14.813
You're on, Lieutenant.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.223
I'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.

05:17.323 --> 05:18.553
I love you. Bye.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.923
Isn't technology
wonderful?

05:26.033 --> 05:28.733
My husband
doesn't think so.

05:28.833 --> 05:30.463
Well, I do.

05:30.573 --> 05:33.733
I used to carry around
those awful mace things.

05:33.843 --> 05:35.243
Now...

05:37.844 --> 05:41.184
I zap any bastard
that screws with me.

05:43.854 --> 05:46.754
I tried it
on my little dog.

05:46.854 --> 05:49.484
Poor thing
limped for a week.

05:49.594 --> 05:51.254
Heh.

05:57.204 --> 05:58.324
Excuse me.

05:59.535 --> 06:02.265
Well, you look really
familiar to me.

06:02.375 --> 06:05.205
I get that a lot.
I've been on TV.

06:05.305 --> 06:07.035
Yeah. Me, too.

06:31.336 --> 06:32.736
Grab the tools,
will you?

06:32.836 --> 06:34.206
You got it.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.736
This is Amy Nichole

06:35.836 --> 06:37.736
reporting live
from Escalan Airport

06:37.846 --> 06:39.636
where deposed general
Ramon Esperanza

06:39.746 --> 06:42.236
has just arrived
under heavy guard.

06:42.346 --> 06:45.147
Strangely, the deposed
dictator's mood seems jubilant.

06:45.247 --> 06:47.747
He is smiling and waving
to the crowd

06:47.857 --> 06:49.717
like a man
running for political office.

06:51.427 --> 06:54.047
...thousands of political
prisoners in the past decade,

06:54.157 --> 06:55.747
including
the new president,

06:55.857 --> 06:57.987
and there's no doubt
that he still has

06:58.097 --> 07:01.257
some ardent supporters
both here and abroad.

07:01.367 --> 07:04.127
Rumors abound on Capitol Hill
that there were other...

07:06.778 --> 07:07.668
Yeah?

07:07.778 --> 07:08.968
Sorry to
bother you, sir.

07:09.078 --> 07:10.098
We're checking
our equipment.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.268
Any problems with
the conduit line?

07:12.378 --> 07:14.278
Gee, I don't know
anything about that.

07:14.378 --> 07:16.678
Would you mind
if we take a look?

07:16.788 --> 07:18.178
Help yourself.

07:29.159 --> 07:31.189
It just don't seem
right somehow--

07:31.299 --> 07:32.699
closing down
this church.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.699
The parish is going to
keep on using it,

07:34.799 --> 07:36.199
but it won't
be the same.

07:36.309 --> 07:38.209
Been here
a lot of years,

07:38.309 --> 07:40.209
and I've been
right here with it.

07:40.309 --> 07:41.939
Yeah, I kind of
feel like

07:42.039 --> 07:44.309
a piece of me is dying
along with this church.

07:44.409 --> 07:46.139
Well, you're right
about that.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.150
...cocaine smuggling,

07:53.260 --> 07:55.880
racketeering, and bribing
government officials.

07:55.990 --> 07:58.590
He certainly
doesn't show it,

07:58.690 --> 08:01.600
but no matter
how high his spirits,

08:01.660 --> 08:03.100
they can't hide the fact

08:03.200 --> 08:04.430
that America's
war on drugs

08:04.530 --> 08:06.190
has finally taken
its first prisoner.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.360
This is Buckwheat.
The clubhouse is open.

08:14.811 --> 08:17.401
Here at Dulles, the quiet men
from the justice department

08:17.511 --> 08:20.211
wait to handcuff the man
who has come to symbolize

08:20.321 --> 08:22.721
the enemy in America's
fight against cocaine.

08:22.821 --> 08:24.721
That battle may be
almost won,

08:24.821 --> 08:26.721
but the war
is still in doubt.

08:26.821 --> 08:29.221
Samantha Coleman, WNTW,
for Night-Time News.

08:29.321 --> 08:30.721
Roger that,
Colonel. Out.

08:47.082 --> 08:48.572
That was the colonel.

08:48.682 --> 08:50.272
Everyone's in position.

08:50.382 --> 08:51.742
How's the weather?

08:51.852 --> 08:54.752
We got flurries all along
the Virginia coast.

08:54.852 --> 08:57.683
New storm front coming in
from the northeast.

08:57.793 --> 08:58.783
Heh heh.

08:58.893 --> 09:01.253
God loves
the infantry.

09:01.363 --> 09:02.553
Amen.

09:02.663 --> 09:05.063
Carry out
your assignments.

09:08.433 --> 09:10.963
15:51. Mark.

09:11.073 --> 09:12.693
Check.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.133
Later.

09:14.243 --> 09:15.573
Adios.

09:36.194 --> 09:38.224
Hey, it's cold
out there, man!

09:38.334 --> 09:40.234
I stomped my feet
for five minutes.

09:40.334 --> 09:41.425
Yeah, yeah.

09:50.545 --> 09:52.915
Two cappuccinos.
Make it fast.

10:13.306 --> 10:14.766
Scotch straight up,
please.

10:14.866 --> 10:16.096
Excuse me, Officers.

10:16.206 --> 10:17.936
This may sound like
a wild-goose chase,

10:18.036 --> 10:19.566
but I think
I just saw--

10:21.246 --> 10:23.766
Saw what?

10:23.876 --> 10:26.577
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

10:28.887 --> 10:31.907
Fuckin' tourists.
Ought to be a law.

10:32.017 --> 10:33.287
Excuse me. There's
a large number of you

10:33.387 --> 10:34.817
from the justice department
here this evening.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.787
Is there any particular
reason for that?

10:36.897 --> 10:37.787
Just routine.

10:37.897 --> 10:38.787
Just routine?

10:38.897 --> 10:39.797
Yes.

10:39.897 --> 10:40.797
Any comment, sir?

10:40.897 --> 10:41.887
Not now.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.897
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.

10:49.168 --> 10:51.568
Hey, that's
Colonel Stuart over there.

10:51.678 --> 10:53.798
Got a little problem
with personnel.

10:53.908 --> 10:55.808
Last-minute replacement.

10:55.908 --> 10:57.968
How's the security
around this place?

10:58.078 --> 11:00.018
Like we figured--
a joke.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.418
Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?

11:02.518 --> 11:04.818
You can have two--
"fuck" and " you."

11:04.918 --> 11:07.358
No pictures,
you pinko bitch.

11:08.928 --> 11:10.689
Old news.

11:24.039 --> 11:24.969
Oh!

11:25.079 --> 11:26.129
Damn it!

11:32.150 --> 11:33.140
Excuse me.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.300
Hey, man.

11:54.011 --> 11:55.301
What is it?

11:55.411 --> 11:57.311
You got a key
for this door?

11:57.411 --> 11:58.811
Yeah. Why?

11:58.911 --> 12:01.711
Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.

12:03.351 --> 12:06.251
Is there a cop on duty
around here?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.581
The airport police.

12:07.691 --> 12:08.981
Go get them.

12:33.882 --> 12:35.212
Ha ha ha!

12:35.312 --> 12:37.282
Hand me the wrench.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.283
Going to work
overtime.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.183
Good idea.

12:41.293 --> 12:44.693
O.K., hold that end.

12:44.793 --> 12:46.783
Watch it, man.

12:46.893 --> 12:50.293
All right.
Perfect. Perfect.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.303
Good to go.

12:52.403 --> 12:53.963
Hey!

12:55.203 --> 12:56.573
It's a restricted area.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.433
What's the matter?

12:58.543 --> 12:59.973
Couldn't wait
for the skycap?

13:00.073 --> 13:00.974
We work here.

13:01.074 --> 13:03.044
Let's see some I.D.

13:03.144 --> 13:04.234
Ha ha.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.334
Sure. No problem.

13:46.896 --> 13:49.656
Oh,jeez. Fuck!

14:12.117 --> 14:13.447
Hiyah!

14:35.608 --> 14:38.098
What is this--
a tag team?

14:59.329 --> 15:01.169
Aah!

15:01.269 --> 15:02.399
Aah!

15:02.499 --> 15:04.839
- Aah!
- Aah!

15:11.349 --> 15:14.210
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.310
Yeah. He said to bring
you guys back here.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.450
Uh! Ah!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.260
Aah! Aah!

15:32.370 --> 15:33.730
Aah! Aah!

15:36.401 --> 15:37.701
Oh!

15:43.381 --> 15:44.281
Christ.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.222
Fucker!

16:04.572 --> 16:06.262
Freeze!

16:07.842 --> 16:09.742
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop.

16:09.842 --> 16:11.502
That was
the bad guy.

16:11.612 --> 16:13.602
Where's your I.D.?

16:17.852 --> 16:20.413
On its way
to Cleveland?

16:25.793 --> 16:27.253
No, you did not
explain anything.

16:27.363 --> 16:28.753
All you did was
shove me back here

16:28.863 --> 16:30.263
into this
cattle car.

16:30.363 --> 16:31.763
Sir, you were told
when you boarded

16:31.863 --> 16:33.263
that we were
overbooked.

16:33.363 --> 16:34.923
Fine. Done.
I accept that.

16:35.063 --> 16:37.263
But why can't I get
the first-class meal?

16:37.373 --> 16:39.773
My network paid for it.
Do you know who I am?

16:39.873 --> 16:41.203
Yes. We've all
seen your program.

16:41.303 --> 16:42.774
Your episode
"Flying Junkyards"

16:42.874 --> 16:45.344
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.

16:45.444 --> 16:46.814
It wasn't nearly
as edifying

16:46.914 --> 16:49.474
as " Bimbos OfThe Sky,"
was it, Connie?

16:49.584 --> 16:51.374
You think
you're funny.

16:51.484 --> 16:52.974
You think you're funny.

16:53.084 --> 16:54.844
Fine.

16:54.954 --> 16:56.284
I've got
your number.

16:56.384 --> 16:57.824
And I've got yours.

16:57.924 --> 17:00.054
So park it, sir.

17:01.724 --> 17:03.254
Fine.

17:12.675 --> 17:14.035
Stewardess.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.635
Mr. Thornberg,

17:15.744 --> 17:17.474
you cannot
monopolize my time.

17:17.575 --> 17:19.345
You cannot put me
near that woman.

17:19.444 --> 17:20.875
Excuse me?

17:20.984 --> 17:23.744
He means he's filed
a restraining order

17:23.855 --> 17:25.755
against me.

17:25.855 --> 17:29.016
I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.

17:29.126 --> 17:31.056
50 yards.

17:31.156 --> 17:33.256
So by keeping me
in this section,

17:33.356 --> 17:35.756
you are violating
a court order.

17:35.866 --> 17:38.266
I can sue you
and this airline.

17:38.366 --> 17:40.266
That woman assaulted me,

17:40.366 --> 17:42.836
and she humiliated me
in public.

17:49.477 --> 17:50.847
What did you do?

17:52.877 --> 17:55.437
Knocked out
two of his teeth.

17:55.547 --> 17:58.547
Would you like
some champagne?

18:01.887 --> 18:04.727
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

18:04.827 --> 18:07.227
Here's your piece
and shield back.

18:07.327 --> 18:09.597
Thanks.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.428
Over here, Officer!

18:11.538 --> 18:13.198
We understand that
there was a shooting.

18:13.298 --> 18:15.998
The presence ofJustice
Department officials...

18:16.108 --> 18:17.508
Jesus!

18:17.608 --> 18:19.508
Hey, come on.
Just a word, O.K.?

18:19.608 --> 18:21.008
What the fuck
are you people--

18:21.108 --> 18:22.508
What are you
doing here, man?

18:22.608 --> 18:24.008
This is a crime scene.

18:24.118 --> 18:25.978
You got to seal
this area off.

18:26.078 --> 18:28.138
That's
up to the captain.

18:28.248 --> 18:29.478
Maybe you better take me

18:29.588 --> 18:31.748
up to the captain,
then, huh?

18:41.129 --> 18:42.359
Where's Cochrane?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.439
He didn't make it.

18:52.879 --> 18:54.339
You're late.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.350
We ran into trouble,
Colonel.

18:58.450 --> 19:02.080
Some cop...
killed Cochrane.

19:02.190 --> 19:04.450
I barely got away,
sir.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.520
Did you accomplish
your mission?

19:06.620 --> 19:09.020
Yes, sir, but...
Cochrane, sir.

19:09.130 --> 19:11.030
Well, then
the damage is minimal.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.030
The penalty
could be severe.

19:21.641 --> 19:23.441
You fail me again,

19:23.541 --> 19:26.031
and the chamber
won't be empty.

19:26.141 --> 19:27.871
Dismissed.

19:31.281 --> 19:33.551
Miss. Miss.
I can't find my dog.

19:33.651 --> 19:35.051
Miss. My dog.

19:35.151 --> 19:36.551
One minute, ma'am.

19:36.651 --> 19:38.621
I want you
to fill out this form.

19:45.162 --> 19:47.862
Who is it?
Come in.

19:47.972 --> 19:49.062
Captain Lorenzo?

19:49.172 --> 19:50.072
Yeah.

19:50.172 --> 19:51.072
I'm John McClane--

19:51.172 --> 19:52.902
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

19:53.002 --> 19:55.562
You're the asshole
that just broke seven FAA

19:55.672 --> 19:57.572
and five District
of Columbia regulations

19:57.682 --> 19:59.202
running around
my airport

19:59.312 --> 20:01.042
with a gun,
shooting at people.

20:01.152 --> 20:02.843
What do you call
that shit?

20:02.953 --> 20:04.213
Self-defense.

20:04.323 --> 20:06.583
Well, what, you think
that L.A. badge

20:06.683 --> 20:08.583
is going to get you

20:08.693 --> 20:10.593
a free lunch or something
around here?

20:10.693 --> 20:13.093
Well...maybe a little
professional courtesy.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.423
Huh! In an airport
on Christmas week?

20:15.533 --> 20:17.083
You've got to be
kidding.

20:17.203 --> 20:18.593
O.K. Fuck courtesy.

20:18.703 --> 20:20.103
How about just
being professional?

20:20.203 --> 20:22.103
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.

20:22.203 --> 20:24.104
You can't wrap this thing
up in 10 minutes.

20:24.204 --> 20:25.604
You got to
seal the area off,

20:25.704 --> 20:27.264
take pictures,
dust for prints.

20:27.374 --> 20:29.504
Hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.

20:29.614 --> 20:31.104
I know
what I'm doing.

20:31.214 --> 20:32.614
We're going
to dust it down.

20:32.714 --> 20:34.614
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibers.

20:34.714 --> 20:36.114
When are you
going to do this?

20:36.214 --> 20:37.614
After 300 or 400
people go through?

20:37.724 --> 20:39.114
You'd be lucky
to get a print

20:39.224 --> 20:40.744
from one
of your own people.

20:40.854 --> 20:41.754
Just shut down
that area and--

20:41.854 --> 20:43.624
Oh,just
shut the area down.

20:43.724 --> 20:46.455
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

20:46.565 --> 20:48.795
Yeah, and I got everybody

20:48.895 --> 20:50.625
from the Shriners'
Convention

20:50.735 --> 20:53.135
to goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

20:53.235 --> 20:55.225
I got lost kids,
lost dogs--

20:55.335 --> 20:57.395
Not now! Later!

20:57.505 --> 20:58.635
I got international
diplomats.

20:58.745 --> 21:01.645
I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here

21:01.745 --> 21:03.575
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!

21:03.675 --> 21:06.075
ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.

21:06.185 --> 21:08.546
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!

21:08.656 --> 21:10.246
What do you think
they're going to say upstairs

21:10.356 --> 21:11.586
when I tell them that?

21:11.686 --> 21:13.126
Pick up the phone
and find out.

21:13.226 --> 21:15.086
I don't need
fuckin' Forensics

21:15.196 --> 21:16.596
to tell me
all this was

21:16.696 --> 21:18.156
was some punk
stealing luggage!

21:18.266 --> 21:20.326
Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.

21:20.436 --> 21:21.656
You know what that is?

21:21.766 --> 21:23.596
It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.

21:23.696 --> 21:25.636
It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machines

21:25.736 --> 21:27.606
and costs more than
you make in a month.

21:27.706 --> 21:29.896
You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.907
If it's more than $1.98,
I'd be very surprised.

21:32.007 --> 21:33.607
Hey, McClane,
don't start believing

21:33.707 --> 21:35.107
your own press, huh?

21:35.217 --> 21:36.977
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about you

21:37.077 --> 21:38.637
and that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,

21:38.747 --> 21:41.117
but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,

21:41.217 --> 21:42.247
that don't make it so.

21:42.357 --> 21:45.417
Look, you are
in my little pond now,

21:45.527 --> 21:48.787
and I am the big fish
that runs it.

21:48.897 --> 21:51.657
So you capped
some lowlife.

21:51.767 --> 21:52.758
Fine.

21:52.868 --> 21:55.128
I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.

21:55.238 --> 21:56.638
a fuckin' commendation!

21:56.738 --> 21:58.758
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office

21:58.868 --> 22:01.638
before I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!

22:12.188 --> 22:14.588
Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.

22:14.688 --> 22:17.209
What sets off the metal
detectors first--

22:17.329 --> 22:19.949
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?

22:20.059 --> 22:21.649
Fat fuck.

22:31.169 --> 22:33.139
Any I.D. on this guy?

22:33.239 --> 22:35.179
That's somebody else's
problem.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.880
Your car's ready.
Sign right here.

22:39.980 --> 22:42.880
I need to borrow
this and this.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.110
I'll bring it
right back.

22:46.220 --> 22:48.120
Hey! Yo!
Hold up!

22:48.220 --> 22:49.690
Yo!

22:51.730 --> 22:53.630
Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.

22:53.730 --> 22:55.630
We got to check
something.

22:55.730 --> 22:57.630
What are you doing?

22:57.730 --> 22:59.631
Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.

22:59.731 --> 23:01.631
All the confusion
in there,

23:01.741 --> 23:04.031
forgot to get
this clown's prints.

23:05.841 --> 23:07.071
Ew! Christ.

23:07.171 --> 23:09.571
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.241
Not anymore.

23:11.351 --> 23:13.141
Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.

23:16.181 --> 23:18.581
Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.

23:18.691 --> 23:20.151
Thanks a lot.

23:55.223 --> 23:56.693
Ahh.

25:13.677 --> 25:15.197
Powell here.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.537
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth

25:16.647 --> 25:17.807
and grab a pencil,
will ya?

25:17.917 --> 25:20.577
Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?

25:20.687 --> 25:22.277
Holly stood me up
a day,

25:22.387 --> 25:24.147
and I'm here alone
in D.C.

25:24.257 --> 25:25.777
with my in-laws.

25:25.887 --> 25:27.787
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

25:27.887 --> 25:30.657
They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.

25:30.757 --> 25:32.127
Listen, Al,

25:32.227 --> 25:34.457
what is the fax machine
telephone number

25:34.568 --> 25:36.118
there at the station?

25:36.228 --> 25:37.598
Uh...

25:37.698 --> 25:41.098
555-3212.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.798
3212. Hold on a second,
all right?

25:43.908 --> 25:46.308
I want to send you
something.

25:46.408 --> 25:47.338
Excuse me.

25:47.448 --> 25:49.808
You and faxes?
This is a first.

25:49.908 --> 25:51.308
Yeah, well,
Holly told me

25:51.418 --> 25:53.468
I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

25:53.578 --> 25:54.678
This way?

25:54.788 --> 25:56.909
No. That way.

25:57.019 --> 25:58.319
Wait.
It's upside down.

25:58.419 --> 25:59.819
It doesn't matter.

25:59.919 --> 26:01.389
O.K. Here it comes.

26:03.459 --> 26:04.929
I'm sending you
something right now.

26:05.029 --> 26:07.329
Hold on a second,
cowboy.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.110
Fingerprints?

26:23.210 --> 26:25.550
We've got an unidentified
stiff here.

26:25.650 --> 26:26.780
I've circled
the whirls in pen

26:26.880 --> 26:28.440
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.

26:28.550 --> 26:30.110
Listen, run it
through state and federal,

26:30.220 --> 26:31.710
and if you can,
run it through Interpol.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.150
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.690
Oh,just a feeling
I have.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.950
Ouch. When you get
those feelings,

26:38.060 --> 26:40.190
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.101
Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...

26:43.201 --> 26:44.671
Is on the top edge
of the transmission...

26:44.771 --> 26:46.531
Is on the top edge

26:46.641 --> 26:48.871
of the transmission
you just got.

26:50.411 --> 26:52.001
Oh, an airport, huh?

26:52.111 --> 26:55.171
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.471
Ha ha. Yeah.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.551
And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.

27:04.692 --> 27:07.052
Just as this storm
starts breaking,

27:07.162 --> 27:10.092
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

27:10.192 --> 27:12.252
Look at this new front
moving in.

27:12.362 --> 27:14.662
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

27:16.432 --> 27:18.092
Well, I can sand down
all the runways

27:18.202 --> 27:20.002
and keep the plows going
between landings,

27:20.102 --> 27:22.002
but you got to
downshift them up there,

27:22.112 --> 27:23.442
give me time to work.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.672
You got it.

27:24.782 --> 27:27.303
All right, everyone.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.283
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

27:30.383 --> 27:33.113
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

27:33.223 --> 27:35.123
The line starts
at the Mississippi,

27:35.223 --> 27:37.283
and they better start
taking numbers.

27:46.233 --> 27:48.224
Can I get you another?

27:51.274 --> 27:52.464
No, thank you.

27:52.574 --> 27:54.274
I only have to
look at his face

27:54.374 --> 27:55.744
for another 15
or 20 minutes.

27:55.844 --> 28:00.244
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

28:00.344 --> 28:02.514
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control

28:02.614 --> 28:05.014
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

28:05.124 --> 28:08.714
We may be up here
a little while longer.

28:08.824 --> 28:10.085
Thank you.

28:10.195 --> 28:11.655
On second
thought...

28:19.105 --> 28:19.995
Al?

28:20.105 --> 28:22.005
Hey, I'm right here,
partner.

28:22.105 --> 28:24.935
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.205
What can you
tell me about him?

28:28.315 --> 28:29.505
He's dead.

28:29.615 --> 28:31.705
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

28:31.815 --> 28:33.616
No, no. You don't
follow me.

28:33.716 --> 28:35.776
According to
the Department of Defense,

28:35.886 --> 28:37.916
he's been dead
for two years.

28:38.026 --> 28:39.286
What?

28:39.386 --> 28:42.256
That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.

28:42.356 --> 28:43.956
American adviser
in Honduras.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.656
Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-11-88.

28:47.766 --> 28:49.286
Officer.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.796
Read between the lines,
and I'd say it looks

28:51.906 --> 28:53.806
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.307
Yeah, I see it.

28:55.407 --> 28:56.967
All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.

28:57.077 --> 28:57.977
Hey, anytime.

28:58.077 --> 28:59.197
O.K.

29:00.747 --> 29:02.907
Say, I close
in about an hour.

29:03.017 --> 29:05.317
Maybe we can go
get a drink?

29:07.447 --> 29:09.347
Just the fax, ma'am.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.947
Just the fax.

29:16.027 --> 29:17.758
Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.

29:17.868 --> 29:19.128
I'll call you back.

29:24.868 --> 29:26.898
The Ghost
of Christmas Past.

29:27.008 --> 29:29.438
Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?

29:29.538 --> 29:30.938
Who are you?

29:31.048 --> 29:33.308
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

29:33.408 --> 29:34.808
Excuse me.

29:34.918 --> 29:37.008
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

29:37.118 --> 29:39.549
Word is that was
your handiwork.

29:39.649 --> 29:42.049
No. I only do
needlepoint.

29:47.289 --> 29:49.289
Great. National
just shut down.

29:49.399 --> 29:51.059
Totally iced.

29:51.169 --> 29:53.289
They're going to
be sending us their planes.

29:53.399 --> 29:54.459
Happy, happy holiday.

29:54.569 --> 29:55.799
The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,

29:55.899 --> 29:56.959
was the press.

29:57.069 --> 29:58.629
Oh, they were
here anyways,

29:58.739 --> 29:59.709
crawling all over
the Esperanza story,

29:59.809 --> 30:01.640
so they got it right
on the fucking news.

30:01.740 --> 30:03.140
You know,
bloodstains and all.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.300
Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporter

30:05.410 --> 30:07.310
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull

30:07.410 --> 30:09.310
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.

30:09.420 --> 30:11.280
Then the ACLU would be
all over us.

30:11.390 --> 30:12.650
Murder on television.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.420
Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.120
What is it? A gang thing
like last time?

30:19.230 --> 30:22.020
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

30:23.501 --> 30:24.401
Who the hell
is this?

30:24.501 --> 30:25.401
Uh-uh,
McClane.

30:25.501 --> 30:26.931
I'm a police officer.

30:27.031 --> 30:28.501
In an unauthorized area.

30:28.601 --> 30:30.231
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

30:30.341 --> 30:33.001
That's what I said
about my last
cholesterol test.

30:33.111 --> 30:36.801
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

30:36.911 --> 30:39.671
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you

30:39.781 --> 30:42.941
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

30:43.051 --> 30:45.682
Maybe he can explain this.

31:04.102 --> 31:05.372
All systems
tapped, Colonel.

31:05.472 --> 31:06.872
Fire it up.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.823
" H" minus five minutes.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.393
Stand by.

31:26.763 --> 31:29.393
All right. We've got
a body in the morgue

31:29.503 --> 31:30.934
that seems
to have died twice.

31:31.034 --> 31:32.264
Assuming it's not
a computer error,

31:32.374 --> 31:33.534
what do we assume?

31:33.634 --> 31:34.834
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck

31:34.944 --> 31:35.964
with this airport.

31:36.074 --> 31:37.774
What is that
supposed to mean?

31:37.874 --> 31:39.774
I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,

31:39.874 --> 31:41.974
so give us a taste
of your genius.

31:42.084 --> 31:43.484
This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?

31:43.584 --> 31:45.104
Look, I'm not sure.

31:45.214 --> 31:48.114
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.

31:48.224 --> 31:49.614
I got to lie down.

31:49.724 --> 31:51.684
The only people that go
to this much trouble

31:51.795 --> 31:53.815
are professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.

31:53.925 --> 31:55.355
Professional at what?

31:55.465 --> 31:56.685
What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,

31:56.795 --> 31:57.885
the safety patrol here?

31:57.995 --> 31:59.985
This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.

32:00.095 --> 32:01.865
You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.

32:01.965 --> 32:03.865
You need a slide rule
to figure this out,

32:03.965 --> 32:05.665
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag

32:05.775 --> 32:06.965
before you start
asking questions?

32:07.075 --> 32:09.405
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.

32:09.505 --> 32:10.405
Remember that.

32:10.505 --> 32:11.945
Yeah, I remember that.

32:17.816 --> 32:21.546
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

32:21.656 --> 32:24.216
What? You're not
buying into this?

32:24.326 --> 32:26.256
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

32:26.356 --> 32:28.056
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

32:28.166 --> 32:29.216
Yeah, I got it.

32:29.326 --> 32:30.386
Oh, my God!

32:30.496 --> 32:31.726
What?

32:31.836 --> 32:33.226
The runways.

32:33.336 --> 32:35.166
What the hell?

32:35.266 --> 32:36.497
They're shutting down.

32:36.607 --> 32:37.727
Jesus Christ.

32:43.977 --> 32:45.847
Go to emergency
lighting now.

32:45.947 --> 32:49.317
Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.217
Backup systems
won't come up.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.407
Shunt to another
terminal.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.007
Bobby, what
do you got?

32:54.117 --> 32:56.087
Nothing.
The whole network is down.

32:56.187 --> 32:57.957
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

32:58.057 --> 32:59.858
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

32:59.958 --> 33:01.858
Dulles, what's going on?
I'm on approach.

33:01.968 --> 33:03.298
Maintain position. Repeat.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.368
What's going on down there?

33:05.468 --> 33:06.628
Roger. We're on it.

33:06.738 --> 33:07.968
We're unable right now.
Please delay.

33:08.068 --> 33:11.468
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure

33:11.578 --> 33:12.738
and hold.

33:12.838 --> 33:15.308
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

33:15.408 --> 33:18.108
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

33:18.218 --> 33:21.279
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

33:34.229 --> 33:35.819
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

33:35.929 --> 33:37.329
What's it
look like?

33:37.429 --> 33:38.829
Approach control--
it's gone.

33:38.939 --> 33:42.029
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.570
Confirmed.
I LS is dead.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.110
Every goddamn
system's dead.

33:48.210 --> 33:50.680
And Inmac monitors
are down.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.790
Attention all controllers.
Attention.

33:57.890 --> 34:00.320
We have a code-red alert.

34:00.420 --> 34:01.980
Every aircraft
approaching our sector

34:02.090 --> 34:04.080
who are not already
in our landing pattern

34:04.190 --> 34:06.321
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.

34:06.431 --> 34:10.301
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern

34:10.400 --> 34:12.801
holds at the outer markers.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.801
Stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.

34:15.911 --> 34:16.931
Move.

34:18.041 --> 34:19.440
Get someone on it!

34:22.150 --> 34:25.641
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

34:25.751 --> 34:28.222
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,

34:28.322 --> 34:30.882
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

34:30.992 --> 34:33.012
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

34:33.121 --> 34:35.022
After that,
those planes low on fuel

34:35.132 --> 34:36.992
aren't going to
be circling.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.792
They're going to be dropping
on the White House lawn.

34:41.572 --> 34:44.931
McClane, this
what you expected?

34:45.042 --> 34:47.331
No.

34:47.442 --> 34:50.433
This is just
the beginning.

34:54.652 --> 34:55.983
FAA hot line.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.713
How could they
know already?

34:57.813 --> 34:59.113
They can't.

35:01.023 --> 35:03.083
Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

35:03.193 --> 35:05.523
Put it on speaker.

35:05.623 --> 35:09.523
Attention, Dulles Tower.
Attention.

35:09.633 --> 35:11.654
They say that blind men
become very attentive

35:11.764 --> 35:12.964
by way of compensation.

35:13.064 --> 35:14.694
Now that you're both
blind and deaf,

35:14.804 --> 35:16.794
I think I've got
your attention.

35:16.904 --> 35:19.804
I'm aware your recorders
are active,

35:19.904 --> 35:21.304
so I'll be quick.

35:21.414 --> 35:23.744
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

35:23.844 --> 35:26.334
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

35:26.444 --> 35:28.814
Who I am is unimportant.

35:28.914 --> 35:30.314
What I want...

35:30.414 --> 35:32.144
Well, if you don't want
those planes

35:32.254 --> 35:33.985
to start splashing
into the Potomac

35:34.085 --> 35:35.645
as they run out
of fuel,

35:35.755 --> 35:37.455
what I want is
very important.

35:37.555 --> 35:39.655
Aplane will be landing
at this airport

35:39.765 --> 35:41.095
in 58 minutes.

35:41.195 --> 35:44.425
It is FM-1,
Foreign Military One.

35:44.535 --> 35:46.335
Now, I'm sure you gentlemen
are well aware

35:46.435 --> 35:47.365
of the unique nature...

35:47.465 --> 35:48.405
Esperanza?

35:48.505 --> 35:49.665
of this flight,

35:49.775 --> 35:50.995
the importance
of its cargo.

35:51.105 --> 35:54.005
This plane will not
be met by anyone.

35:54.105 --> 35:57.516
It will land on a runway
of my designation,

35:57.616 --> 36:00.916
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

36:01.016 --> 36:03.456
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft

36:03.556 --> 36:05.316
and your responsibility
for it.

36:05.426 --> 36:09.786
At the same time, I want
a 7 47 cargo conversion

36:09.896 --> 36:13.586
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.

36:13.696 --> 36:17.526
You have two more minutes
to advise your inbound aircraft

36:17.636 --> 36:19.067
to hold at their
outer radio marker.

36:19.167 --> 36:21.967
After that,you will be
able to receive only.

36:22.077 --> 36:23.907
Any attempt to restore
your systems

36:24.007 --> 36:26.737
will be met
by severe penalties.

36:26.847 --> 36:27.867
He's bluffing.

36:29.247 --> 36:30.577
Damn it,
you can't do this.

36:30.677 --> 36:32.647
I am doing this.

36:39.987 --> 36:41.478
O.K., you guys,
listen up.

36:41.598 --> 36:43.318
I need you to punch up
a code 15.

36:43.428 --> 36:45.328
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

36:45.428 --> 36:46.628
If Esperanza gets
on that plane

36:46.728 --> 36:48.528
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,

36:48.638 --> 36:49.828
we're fucked.

36:49.938 --> 36:51.998
They're talking to us
on our own system.

36:52.108 --> 36:53.198
They got to be close.

36:53.308 --> 36:54.928
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

36:55.038 --> 36:56.938
Just in the nick
of time, huh?

36:57.038 --> 36:59.238
Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,

36:59.348 --> 37:00.438
S.W.A.T. team and all.

37:00.548 --> 37:02.038
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

37:02.148 --> 37:04.449
My wife's on one
of the goddamn planes

37:04.549 --> 37:05.449
these guys
are fucking with.

37:05.549 --> 37:06.779
That puts me
on the playing field.

37:06.889 --> 37:08.949
If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,

37:09.059 --> 37:10.819
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

37:10.919 --> 37:12.819
That's it. Security.
You're out of here.

37:12.929 --> 37:14.949
Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind you

37:15.059 --> 37:16.219
about FAA regulations

37:16.329 --> 37:17.489
regarding
unauthorized personnel

37:17.599 --> 37:18.689
in the control tower?

37:18.799 --> 37:20.819
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

37:20.929 --> 37:22.629
Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shack

37:22.739 --> 37:23.629
and get a transmitter?

37:23.739 --> 37:24.700
We already have one.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.530
The new terminal wing
they're building--

37:26.640 --> 37:27.870
20 airlines
when it's done,

37:27.970 --> 37:29.530
all with their own
reservation computers,

37:29.640 --> 37:31.610
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.610
You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.480
You got no business
being up here.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.480
I'm telling you guys.
Everything we need

37:37.580 --> 37:39.050
is over
by the Annex Skywalk

37:39.150 --> 37:40.710
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.

37:40.820 --> 37:41.720
The Annex Skywalk?

37:41.820 --> 37:42.880
Goddamn it, Trudeau.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.050
You're dealing
with pros here.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.650
You can't fuck
with these people.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.661
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

37:47.761 --> 37:48.991
Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors

37:49.101 --> 37:50.061
flying around here
today.

37:50.161 --> 37:51.391
No way. No way, lady.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.521
Hell, no. No.

37:52.631 --> 37:54.791
This is off limits,
Coleman.

37:54.901 --> 37:56.391
Get them
out of here.

37:56.501 --> 37:59.061
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

37:59.171 --> 38:01.071
Get your fucking hands
off me.

38:01.171 --> 38:03.071
For shit's sake.
Just get them both out of here.

38:04.511 --> 38:06.411
Lobby Security,
come in.

38:06.511 --> 38:07.411
Tomalson here.

38:07.511 --> 38:09.112
This is
Captain Lorenzo here

38:09.222 --> 38:11.012
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.382
Now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,

38:13.492 --> 38:14.682
get them
out of the elevator,

38:14.792 --> 38:16.692
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip

38:16.792 --> 38:18.522
in your Christmas
stocking.

38:18.632 --> 38:19.922
10-4. Let's go.

38:20.032 --> 38:22.622
Goddamn!

38:22.732 --> 38:24.292
Anything who
can think of?

38:24.402 --> 38:25.302
Can't fuck
with what guy?

38:25.402 --> 38:26.702
Shit. Hang on
over there.

38:26.802 --> 38:27.822
Just hang on.

38:29.472 --> 38:31.373
Big drug dealer on
his way to prison,

38:31.473 --> 38:32.703
gunfight at airport,

38:32.813 --> 38:34.713
every controller
in the coffee shop

38:34.813 --> 38:36.373
getting beeped
and hauling ass,

38:36.483 --> 38:37.883
and you rocking
the boat.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.213
Connection?
Come on, McClane.

38:39.313 --> 38:40.373
Just a few words.

38:40.483 --> 38:42.113
O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.

38:42.223 --> 38:46.713
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

38:46.823 --> 38:49.053
Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.

38:49.163 --> 38:50.253
That's who he was.

38:50.363 --> 38:52.993
Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!

38:53.093 --> 38:56.124
Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.

39:07.074 --> 39:08.404
Hi.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.244
Where's the other one?

39:10.344 --> 39:11.374
Claustrophobic,
I guess.

39:13.914 --> 39:16.015
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close

39:16.125 --> 39:17.285
it doesn't matter.

39:17.385 --> 39:19.185
I can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,

39:19.295 --> 39:21.025
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.925
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

39:23.025 --> 39:25.895
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

39:25.995 --> 39:28.365
I want my S.W.A.T. team
to go with him as cover.

39:28.465 --> 39:31.025
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

39:35.505 --> 39:38.376
Oh, man. I can't
fucking believe this.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.376
Another basement.
Another elevator.

39:40.476 --> 39:44.936
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

40:06.177 --> 40:07.577
What the fuck?

40:07.677 --> 40:11.907
# You're sure to fall
in love with old #

40:12.017 --> 40:13.407
# Cape #

40:13.517 --> 40:15.067
# Cod #

40:15.187 --> 40:16.737
# Old Cape Cod #

40:16.847 --> 40:20.117
# That old Cape Cod #

40:20.217 --> 40:23.088
# If you like the taste #

40:23.188 --> 40:27.428
# Of a lobster stew #

40:27.528 --> 40:32.228
# Served by a window
with an ocean view #

40:32.338 --> 40:33.728
# You're sure #

40:33.838 --> 40:38.328
# You're sure to fall
in love with old #

40:38.438 --> 40:40.808
# Cape Cod ##

40:42.578 --> 40:43.648
Who are you?

40:43.648 --> 40:44.509
Who are you?

40:46.049 --> 40:48.139
I'm Marvin.

40:48.249 --> 40:49.909
Marvin. I'm Marvin.

40:50.019 --> 40:51.919
I thought
you was trying

40:52.019 --> 40:54.119
to steal my records,
that's all.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.519
I'm just the janitor.

41:02.199 --> 41:04.219
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft

41:04.329 --> 41:06.359
holding at Potomac Vortex.

41:06.470 --> 41:09.270
We are experiencing
some technical problems here.

41:09.370 --> 41:11.270
Weather conditions, which have
been deteriorating all day,

41:11.370 --> 41:15.870
have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

41:15.980 --> 41:19.710
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment

41:19.820 --> 41:21.880
and their redundant backups,
as well.

41:21.990 --> 41:25.650
As a result, our Nav
and approach systems are down,

41:25.760 --> 41:28.090
and we expect to lose voice
in another minute.

41:28.190 --> 41:29.591
We want you to continue

41:29.691 --> 41:32.631
holding at the outer marker
as directed

41:32.731 --> 41:34.661
and wait
for further instructions.

41:34.761 --> 41:36.861
As soon as we're
back on line,

41:36.971 --> 41:40.061
we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

41:40.171 --> 41:42.661
Good luck.

41:45.381 --> 41:47.101
God bless.

41:52.852 --> 41:54.042
All right.
Change the boards.

42:22.513 --> 42:24.143
Hey, stand back.

42:24.253 --> 42:25.153
The Skywalk
Annex.

42:25.253 --> 42:26.743
No, Goddamn it.
The Annex Skywalk.

42:26.853 --> 42:29.253
It's the last thing
I heard

42:29.353 --> 42:30.283
before they
kicked me out.

42:30.393 --> 42:32.583
Well, let me
see here, now.

42:32.693 --> 42:34.493
Well, this must be it
right there.

42:34.593 --> 42:37.124
See? That's
the raised platform,

42:37.234 --> 42:39.324
and there's
the new terminal.

42:39.434 --> 42:40.834
There's your Skywalk.

42:40.934 --> 42:43.134
Goddamn bottleneck.

42:43.234 --> 42:45.794
Nice place
for an ambush.

42:45.904 --> 42:47.104
What's
the fastest way

42:47.204 --> 42:48.864
you can get me
out to that spot?

42:51.544 --> 42:54.874
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

42:54.984 --> 42:57.044
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

42:57.154 --> 42:59.015
Yeah? Who watches yours?

43:10.165 --> 43:12.065
Main ventilation duct.

43:12.165 --> 43:14.565
Main ventilation duct.

43:14.665 --> 43:17.065
And bingo.

43:17.175 --> 43:18.405
Just once,

43:18.505 --> 43:21.806
I'd like a regular,
normal Christmas...

43:23.676 --> 43:28.586
Eggnog, a fucking
Christmas tree,

43:28.686 --> 43:30.586
a little turkey...

43:30.686 --> 43:33.586
But, no, I got
to crawl around

43:33.686 --> 43:36.176
in this
motherfucking tin can.

43:40.596 --> 43:43.867
We're in the Annex Skywalk.
I can see the array.

43:43.967 --> 43:45.897
I'll give you a call
for a protocol test

43:46.007 --> 43:46.937
as soon as it's hot.

43:47.037 --> 43:48.227
That's all for now.

43:48.337 --> 43:50.737
Sergeant, we need
some more equipment.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.637
I'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.

43:52.747 --> 43:54.607
Right, sir.
You got it.

43:57.947 --> 43:59.707
What the hell's
going on?

43:59.817 --> 44:01.807
Hey! Put that
back on!

44:03.487 --> 44:06.718
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

44:06.828 --> 44:09.058
A sitting duck.

44:10.158 --> 44:11.958
Take him!

44:13.668 --> 44:14.628
Shit!

44:16.168 --> 44:19.568
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

44:23.778 --> 44:25.678
Look out!
Get down!

44:37.359 --> 44:38.919
Aah!

44:55.480 --> 44:57.170
Aah!

46:05.483 --> 46:06.673
Stay down!

46:20.894 --> 46:22.224
Fuck!

46:31.344 --> 46:32.534
Come on.

46:53.635 --> 46:56.255
Fucking son
of a bitch.

47:02.406 --> 47:03.306
Aah!

47:12.986 --> 47:14.246
Shit.

47:14.356 --> 47:16.286
Ah. Oh.

47:24.697 --> 47:27.667
I'm going to kick
your fucking ass.

48:00.898 --> 48:02.368
Jeez.

48:02.468 --> 48:03.998
You all right?

48:04.108 --> 48:05.698
Yeah. Yeah.
But the antenna array--

48:05.808 --> 48:07.969
I got to get to it
and set it up.

48:12.919 --> 48:14.079
Get down!

48:33.470 --> 48:35.600
Goddamn.

48:37.170 --> 48:38.470
Bait.

48:41.140 --> 48:42.580
Jerk us off,

48:42.680 --> 48:46.240
make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

48:50.190 --> 48:52.651
Make you waste
your time...

48:55.691 --> 48:57.561
time we don't have.

49:11.141 --> 49:14.041
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

49:14.141 --> 49:17.702
So's that airplane.
Practically.

49:17.812 --> 49:20.152
Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.

49:20.252 --> 49:22.152
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

49:22.252 --> 49:24.282
There's nothing
regular about it.

49:24.392 --> 49:26.722
See? You're intrigued.

49:26.822 --> 49:28.382
That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.

49:28.492 --> 49:29.652
I notice things--

49:29.762 --> 49:31.562
things other people
wouldn't see.

49:31.662 --> 49:34.492
That's how I make
people curious.

49:34.602 --> 49:36.432
Don't you mean
nauseous?

49:36.532 --> 49:39.063
Look. The people have
a right to know

49:39.173 --> 49:40.573
everything about everybody.

49:40.673 --> 49:43.003
You got
in the way of that.

49:43.113 --> 49:45.943
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,

49:46.043 --> 49:47.573
and you didn't do it

49:47.683 --> 49:49.583
for anything as noble
as the people.

49:49.683 --> 49:51.583
The only time you even
see the people

49:51.683 --> 49:53.443
is when you look down

49:53.553 --> 49:56.143
to see what it is
you're stepping on.

49:58.183 --> 50:00.084
Me? Yeah, I'll live,

50:00.184 --> 50:02.584
but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,

50:02.684 --> 50:05.084
and the antenna array
is gone.

50:06.184 --> 50:09.094
Didn't you see it?

50:09.194 --> 50:12.164
It's hard looking
for a new miracle.

50:13.694 --> 50:14.594
Just hold
for a minute.

50:14.694 --> 50:15.924
I'll be
right back.

50:16.034 --> 50:16.934
Just hold
for a second.

50:17.034 --> 50:17.934
Something's
going on here.

50:18.034 --> 50:21.095
Yeah.Just hold on
for a minute.

50:21.205 --> 50:25.105
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

50:25.205 --> 50:28.175
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

50:29.745 --> 50:31.505
It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.

50:31.615 --> 50:33.585
Can you do anything
with it?

50:34.915 --> 50:35.815
No.
This scramble mode

50:35.915 --> 50:37.815
must activate
on this code panel.

50:37.925 --> 50:40.045
Even if we scan
their frequency,

50:40.155 --> 50:41.215
we can't listen in.

50:41.325 --> 50:43.155
These guys are pros.

50:43.256 --> 50:44.286
So are you.
Break the code.

50:44.396 --> 50:45.416
I want to hear

50:45.526 --> 50:46.796
what these bastards are
saying to each other.

50:46.896 --> 50:48.196
This is a 10-digit
control panel.

50:48.296 --> 50:49.286
Six-digit read-out.

50:49.396 --> 50:51.896
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

50:52.006 --> 50:53.906
Next time you kill one
of these guys,

50:54.006 --> 50:55.936
get him to enter
the code first.

50:56.036 --> 50:57.166
Yeah.

50:58.306 --> 51:00.136
Sir, we just
monitored a call

51:00.246 --> 51:01.836
from their
chief engineer.

51:01.946 --> 51:04.506
Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.

51:04.616 --> 51:06.587
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

51:06.687 --> 51:07.747
We're right
on schedule.

51:07.857 --> 51:10.817
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

51:16.197 --> 51:18.057
Attention, Dulles Tower.

51:18.167 --> 51:19.857
Attention,
Dulles Control Tower.

51:19.967 --> 51:23.027
Mr. Trudeau,
I know you're listening.

51:23.137 --> 51:24.757
Unfortunately,
you're not obeying.

51:24.867 --> 51:26.897
Try me face to face,
and we'll see.

51:27.007 --> 51:28.838
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

51:28.938 --> 51:30.838
You've wasted lives
and precious time

51:30.948 --> 51:32.738
on a futile
and obvious target.

51:32.848 --> 51:35.578
Now you're going
to pay the penalty.

51:35.678 --> 51:37.878
I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.

51:37.988 --> 51:39.708
Isn't that penalty enough?

51:39.818 --> 51:41.188
McClane,
you keep out of this.

51:41.288 --> 51:42.518
You've been
nothing but a pain--

51:44.488 --> 51:48.358
Oh, McClane.
John McClane.

51:48.458 --> 51:53.699
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

51:53.799 --> 51:55.959
I read about you
in People magazine.

51:56.069 --> 51:57.939
You seemed out of your league
on Nightline, I thought.

51:58.039 --> 51:59.269
Hey, Colonel,
blow me.

51:59.369 --> 52:00.599
How much drug money

52:00.709 --> 52:03.399
is Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?

52:03.509 --> 52:05.069
Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.

52:05.179 --> 52:07.369
Treason is merely
a matter of dates.

52:07.479 --> 52:09.379
This country's got to learn

52:09.479 --> 52:11.509
that it can't keep
cutting the legs off

52:11.619 --> 52:13.590
of men like
General Esperanza,

52:13.690 --> 52:15.680
men who have the guts
to stand up

52:15.790 --> 52:17.190
against
Communist aggression.

52:18.790 --> 52:20.590
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

52:20.700 --> 52:24.600
What's lesson two--
the neutron bomb?

52:24.700 --> 52:27.220
No. I think we can find
something in between.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.170
Watch this.

52:32.740 --> 52:34.641
Give me
a flight number,

52:34.741 --> 52:36.571
one that's
low on fuel.

52:36.681 --> 52:38.771
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

52:38.881 --> 52:41.851
Fuel tank's
dry as a martini.

52:41.951 --> 52:44.251
Activate the I LS
landing system,

52:44.351 --> 52:46.051
but recalibrate
sea level

52:46.151 --> 52:49.721
minus 200 feet.

53:13.822 --> 53:15.182
Oh,Jesus!

53:15.282 --> 53:17.582
They've reset ground level
minus 200 feet.

53:18.753 --> 53:20.313
Windsor flight 114.

53:20.423 --> 53:21.623
This is Dulles Approach.

53:21.723 --> 53:23.453
Do you copy?

53:23.563 --> 53:26.053
Dulles Approach,
this is Windsor 114.

53:26.163 --> 53:27.633
Where the devil
have you been?

53:27.733 --> 53:29.323
Windsor 114.
Dulles Approach.

53:29.433 --> 53:32.333
We've been right here
all along, old buddy.

53:32.433 --> 53:34.923
Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.

53:35.043 --> 53:39.273
Windsor 114, you are cleared
for ILS approach,

53:39.373 --> 53:40.774
runway two-niner.

53:40.884 --> 53:43.784
Contact Dulles Tower frequency
at the outer marker.

53:43.884 --> 53:44.784
Jesus Christ,

53:44.884 --> 53:46.144
he's going to crash
the fucking plane!

53:46.254 --> 53:47.814
Roger, Approach,
and about time.

53:47.924 --> 53:50.984
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

53:51.094 --> 53:52.554
Roger, 114. Understand.

53:52.654 --> 53:54.144
Calibrate Dulles
altimeter...

53:54.264 --> 53:55.194
Oh,Jesus.

53:55.294 --> 53:57.664
They'll fly
right into the concrete.

53:57.764 --> 53:58.784
Son of a bitch!

53:58.894 --> 54:00.864
Why are they
listening to him?

54:00.964 --> 54:02.334
It's our frequency!
Why shouldn't they?

54:02.434 --> 54:03.695
Dulles,
this is Windsor 114.

54:03.805 --> 54:05.065
Barnes!

54:05.175 --> 54:08.075
This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact...

54:08.175 --> 54:10.165
Give me your coat!

54:10.275 --> 54:12.245
Windsor 114, stand by...

54:12.345 --> 54:13.315
What are you
going to do?

54:13.415 --> 54:16.145
Whatever I can.

54:18.855 --> 54:21.045
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:21.155 --> 54:23.175
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.

54:23.285 --> 54:25.126
We're sorry
for the inconvenience,

54:25.226 --> 54:28.126
but we'll all be on the ground
in a few minutes. Thank you.

54:28.226 --> 54:30.126
Please keep
your seat belts on.

54:30.226 --> 54:31.256
Oh, not to worry.

54:31.366 --> 54:33.126
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,

54:33.236 --> 54:35.136
so you won't
miss it, O.K.?

54:35.236 --> 54:36.636
In your seat, please.

54:36.736 --> 54:38.636
Come on, in your seat.

54:38.736 --> 54:39.636
Oh, hey.

54:39.736 --> 54:42.136
We're just like
British Rail, love.

54:42.246 --> 54:44.646
We may be late,
but we get you there.

54:44.746 --> 54:46.236
Don't worry.

55:02.267 --> 55:03.857
Good luck, McClane!

55:27.358 --> 55:29.018
Dulles, this is Windsor 114,

55:29.128 --> 55:31.588
inside the outer marker.

55:31.699 --> 55:34.129
Roger, 114.
This is Dulles Tower.

55:34.229 --> 55:36.629
We have radar contact
and show you on I LS.

55:36.729 --> 55:39.399
You're in the glide path,
and you're looking good.

55:48.709 --> 55:50.199
There's somebody
out there!

55:54.720 --> 55:56.310
It's McClane.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.250
Christ.

56:01.990 --> 56:03.760
Approach flaps.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.660
Approach flaps.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.290
Approach speed 140.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.660
Approach speed 140.

56:09.770 --> 56:11.390
130.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.830
Altitude 1,000 feet.

56:13.940 --> 56:16.000
800, guys!
You're only at 800 feet!

56:16.111 --> 56:17.271
Fire and Rescue,
this is Cummings.

56:17.381 --> 56:19.401
Roll everything
out to runway two-niner!

56:19.511 --> 56:22.071
Ref speed plus 20.

56:22.181 --> 56:23.981
600 feet.

56:25.221 --> 56:26.681
Looking good, Windsor.

56:26.781 --> 56:28.121
Now, watch it.

56:28.221 --> 56:31.121
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.121
Atta boy. We've got you.

56:34.231 --> 56:35.691
We've got you.

56:48.872 --> 56:50.202
Pull it up!

56:51.382 --> 56:52.772
Jesus!

57:05.923 --> 57:07.653
Aah! We're going to die!

57:07.763 --> 57:09.283
We've got you.

57:33.224 --> 57:34.714
No...

57:35.824 --> 57:37.314
God.

57:41.734 --> 57:43.724
Motherfucker.

57:46.135 --> 57:48.225
Motherfucker.

57:52.245 --> 57:53.705
Oh,Jesus.

58:04.855 --> 58:06.755
That concludes
our object lesson

58:06.855 --> 58:08.256
for this evening.

58:08.356 --> 58:11.656
If the 7 47 we requested
is ready on time

58:11.766 --> 58:14.166
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,

58:14.266 --> 58:16.166
further lessons
can be avoided.

58:16.266 --> 58:17.526
Out.

59:04.078 --> 59:06.638
We got no sign
of survivors down here.

59:06.748 --> 59:08.238
It's a goddamn nightmare.

59:09.858 --> 59:12.488
Hey, Nelson!
Come here.

59:22.469 --> 59:23.699
Barnes!

59:24.909 --> 59:26.269
We've got to
warn those planes

59:26.369 --> 59:28.199
there's a lunatic
down here.

59:28.309 --> 59:30.329
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

59:30.439 --> 59:31.339
How?

59:31.449 --> 59:32.779
You figure it out!

59:32.879 --> 59:34.309
Here's the manifest.

59:54.740 --> 59:57.730
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:05.341
I wanted to help
those people.

01:00:06.751 --> 01:00:09.981
I was pretty
goddamn useless.

01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:15.151
We called
the government for help.

01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:19.091
They're going to send in
a special Army unit,

01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:21.182
a counterterrorist team.

01:00:28.202 --> 01:00:31.102
Your wife's plane?

01:00:31.212 --> 01:00:32.502
Well, they're
still broadcasting

01:00:32.612 --> 01:00:34.972
even though
we can't answer them.

01:00:36.982 --> 01:00:40.042
They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.

01:00:51.733 --> 01:00:53.123
Listen, Dick.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.963
That is your name?

01:00:55.063 --> 01:00:56.153
Dick.

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.133
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

01:00:58.233 --> 01:01:00.133
do you think
you might consider

01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:01.603
switching
after-shaves?

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:04.934
Anything else?

01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:08.104
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

01:01:08.214 --> 01:01:09.304
And here's Sam Coleman

01:01:09.414 --> 01:01:11.144
reporting live
from the site of the accident.

01:01:11.254 --> 01:01:12.304
Well, Colonel,

01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:14.144
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.654
so far.

01:01:15.754 --> 01:01:17.884
But still there has been
no official word.

01:01:17.994 --> 01:01:20.084
Meanwhile, despite the fact

01:01:20.194 --> 01:01:23.094
only one runway has been
closed due to the tragedy,

01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:25.994
several dozen airliners are
visible from where I stand,

01:01:26.094 --> 01:01:27.495
endlessly
circling the field.

01:01:27.595 --> 01:01:30.095
Other reports say that
there was trouble in the tower

01:01:30.205 --> 01:01:31.605
before the crash

01:01:31.705 --> 01:01:33.465
and that that may have even
contributed to it.

01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:34.665
One thing is certain.

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:36.135
With weather conditions
worsening,

01:01:36.245 --> 01:01:38.145
the problem here
and in the sky above us

01:01:38.245 --> 01:01:39.645
will continue to grow.

01:01:39.745 --> 01:01:43.045
I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles
International Airport.

01:01:50.086 --> 01:01:51.056
Victor. Victor.

01:01:51.156 --> 01:01:52.056
Victor.

01:01:52.156 --> 01:01:53.216
Yeah, what's up?

01:01:53.326 --> 01:01:54.656
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,

01:01:54.766 --> 01:01:56.156
or did you put them
in your carry-on?

01:01:56.266 --> 01:01:57.316
Are you crazy?

01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:58.826
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.

01:01:58.936 --> 01:02:00.156
I love you.

01:02:00.266 --> 01:02:02.256
Give me one
of the receivers.

01:02:06.276 --> 01:02:09.676
Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?

01:02:09.776 --> 01:02:11.177
Yeah. Why?

01:02:11.277 --> 01:02:14.007
I want to hear
what's going on.

01:02:15.117 --> 01:02:18.147
Should be right here
on our band.

01:02:18.257 --> 01:02:19.587
Nothing.

01:02:19.687 --> 01:02:20.587
You just told me
it would work.

01:02:20.687 --> 01:02:21.587
Is it working
or not working?

01:02:21.687 --> 01:02:22.587
It is working,
but it's--

01:02:22.687 --> 01:02:23.677
All I'm getting

01:02:23.787 --> 01:02:26.187
is some kind
of airport beacon.

01:02:26.297 --> 01:02:27.187
It's weird.

01:02:27.297 --> 01:02:30.127
It's like the tower
isn't there.

01:02:31.797 --> 01:02:33.288
Stay on it.

01:02:34.538 --> 01:02:36.728
Let me know when there is
something there.

01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:38.138
O.K.

01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:18.180
Major Grant.
We're Blue Light.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.180
Rollins, Department
ofJustice.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.180
Trudeau, Chief
of Air Operations.

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.550
Lorenzo,
Terminal Police.

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.550
You want something,
you got it.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.620
This is it?

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.660
One fucking platoon?

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.130
One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:32.320
John McClane.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:35.230
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.230
Yeah.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.730
Now show some
good sense.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.431
Let the pros
handle this.

01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:42.201
Yeah, well,
it looks like

01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:43.711
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.

01:03:43.811 --> 01:03:45.041
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

01:03:45.141 --> 01:03:46.701
No, not anymore,
he's not.

01:03:46.811 --> 01:03:47.711
Now we're here

01:03:47.811 --> 01:03:48.901
to take Colonel
Stuart down.

01:03:49.011 --> 01:03:51.241
And we will
take him down.

01:03:51.351 --> 01:03:52.711
You see,
I served with him.

01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:54.511
I taught him
everything he knows.

01:03:54.621 --> 01:03:56.211
Well, maybe
he's learned

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:58.351
a few more things
since then.

01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:00.851
Let's hustle!

01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:02.652
The command post
will be set up

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:04.162
in the airport
police station.

01:04:04.262 --> 01:04:06.162
I want to be
tied in to the tower

01:04:06.262 --> 01:04:07.162
in 15 minutes.

01:04:07.262 --> 01:04:09.262
All right,
let's do it!

01:04:10.372 --> 01:04:11.932
Hey, Trudeau.

01:04:13.442 --> 01:04:16.272
Did things just get
better or worse?

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:22.612
Lights--
big, portable lights.

01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:24.773
We set up the field,
and then we--

01:04:24.883 --> 01:04:25.943
We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.

01:04:26.053 --> 01:04:28.113
And where do we get
those big, portable lights--

01:04:28.223 --> 01:04:29.123
Borrow them
from Batman?

01:04:29.223 --> 01:04:31.123
What about
the airphone idea?

01:04:31.223 --> 01:04:32.123
There's 18 planes
up there.

01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:34.023
Only five of them
have those phones.

01:04:34.123 --> 01:04:35.023
We got through
to three of them.

01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:36.493
We're still trying
on the others.

01:04:36.593 --> 01:04:38.323
That leaves 13 accidents
waiting to happen.

01:04:38.433 --> 01:04:39.333
Are they still
bucking head winds?

01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:40.333
I just checked
the weather.

01:04:40.433 --> 01:04:41.493
Head winds are
slamming everybody

01:04:41.603 --> 01:04:42.503
over the outer marker.

01:04:42.603 --> 01:04:43.663
The planes
with enough fuel

01:04:43.773 --> 01:04:45.673
have already been
shunted to Atlanta,

01:04:45.773 --> 01:04:47.174
Memphis, and Nashville.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.004
Outer marker.

01:04:49.114 --> 01:04:51.014
Damn!

01:04:51.114 --> 01:04:52.674
The outer marker!

01:04:52.784 --> 01:04:54.184
It's a beacon, right?

01:04:54.284 --> 01:04:56.184
It sends out this
"beep beep beep"

01:04:56.284 --> 01:04:57.844
so they know they're
over it, right?

01:04:57.954 --> 01:04:59.184
So?

01:04:59.284 --> 01:05:00.274
So who says
that radio signal

01:05:00.384 --> 01:05:01.324
has to just beep?

01:05:01.424 --> 01:05:02.684
Right.
We switch the frequency

01:05:02.794 --> 01:05:04.154
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.

01:05:04.254 --> 01:05:06.024
We pump up the wattage.

01:05:06.124 --> 01:05:07.094
And we can talk
to our planes,

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:08.094
and those bastards
who did this

01:05:08.194 --> 01:05:09.185
will never know!

01:05:12.735 --> 01:05:14.135
Traced the signal.

01:05:14.235 --> 01:05:15.705
Found it in
the luggage area.

01:05:15.805 --> 01:05:16.705
They've been tapped in

01:05:16.805 --> 01:05:18.465
to your tower chatter
all night.

01:05:18.575 --> 01:05:20.565
Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:25.645
How you doing,
Telford?

01:05:25.745 --> 01:05:26.645
No good.

01:05:26.745 --> 01:05:27.645
I called Lang.

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:29.145
They're rigging
a portable decoder.

01:05:29.255 --> 01:05:30.415
It'll be here
in two hours.

01:05:30.515 --> 01:05:32.146
My wife doesn't
have two hours.

01:05:32.256 --> 01:05:34.656
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.656
The regular guy
got appendicitis.

01:05:36.756 --> 01:05:39.596
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

01:05:39.696 --> 01:05:40.996
Attention!

01:05:41.096 --> 01:05:43.656
Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:45.666
I want to hear about

01:05:45.766 --> 01:05:47.926
the plane
those bastards asked for.

01:05:48.036 --> 01:05:49.236
Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:51.166
Pilots' briefing room.
Now.

01:05:51.276 --> 01:05:52.176
Keep working.

01:05:52.276 --> 01:05:54.247
Albertson.
With me.

01:05:58.987 --> 01:06:01.007
No civilians.

01:06:11.797 --> 01:06:13.557
What the fuck?

01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:15.688
What is it?

01:06:15.798 --> 01:06:17.628
The outer marker beeper.

01:06:17.738 --> 01:06:20.898
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

01:06:21.008 --> 01:06:23.138
Attention all aircraft
in Dulles landing pattern.

01:06:23.238 --> 01:06:25.298
This is Chief Engineer
Leslie Barnes.

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:28.138
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

01:06:28.248 --> 01:06:32.648
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

01:06:32.748 --> 01:06:35.148
Here is the situation.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.489
Approximately two hours ago...

01:06:40.259 --> 01:06:42.159
Wait until you
get a load of this.

01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:44.659
Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower

01:06:44.769 --> 01:06:47.359
unless you hear your own
flight recoder access code.

01:06:47.469 --> 01:06:48.529
The terrorists
have got all...

01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:49.529
Holy shit!

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.529
our systems and now...

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:51.899
Get this on tape!

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.529
have control of everything
except this channel.

01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:55.069
Give us a second
here, please.

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:57.669
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

01:06:57.779 --> 01:07:00.680
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.540
to reply on
your own frequencies

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.840
to this broadcast.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.010
These people have already
caused one crash

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.140
by impersonating our tower.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.240
Jesus.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.290
Repeat. The terrorists
have cut off

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.131
the two systems that can
allow you to land--

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:26.141
field lights
for a visual landing

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:28.141
and the ILS
for an instrument.

01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:31.141
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.511
and preparing to take out
the terrorists.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:33.641
My God.

01:07:33.751 --> 01:07:34.941
Don't accept
any instructions...

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.141
Yo, Marvin.

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.151
Hey, you interested
in a nice coat?

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:39.651
No. It never looked
good on me anyway.

01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:41.311
Listen, you've
got to get me

01:07:41.421 --> 01:07:42.451
up to the pilots'
briefing room.

01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:46.152
I've got to hear
what they're saying.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.662
Which one of these maps
gets me in there?

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:48.662
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

01:07:48.762 --> 01:07:49.662
Find the map,
Marvin.

01:07:49.762 --> 01:07:50.822
I'll find it.

01:07:50.932 --> 01:07:52.662
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system here.

01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.172
Let's see.
Pilots' Briefing Room.

01:07:54.272 --> 01:07:56.002
I think that's
in the main terminal,

01:07:56.102 --> 01:07:59.872
so would that be under
"P" for Pilots' Briefing Room?

01:07:59.972 --> 01:08:01.342
Or maybe it would be

01:08:01.442 --> 01:08:03.912
under " M"
for Miscellaneous.

01:08:08.013 --> 01:08:09.313
Oh, shit!

01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:11.353
Request permission
to reduce sentry duty

01:08:11.453 --> 01:08:12.983
to 30-minute rotation.

01:08:13.093 --> 01:08:15.053
My men are getting cold
and antsy. Over.

01:08:15.163 --> 01:08:16.493
This is Colonel Stuart.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.082
Have the men not on watch
assemble for a briefing.

01:08:19.193 --> 01:08:20.093
Roger, Colonel.

01:08:20.193 --> 01:08:21.353
What's the matter?

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:24.122
Oh...

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.633
Gentlemen...

01:08:26.733 --> 01:08:29.134
Tonight, the pattern ends.

01:08:29.243 --> 01:08:31.703
The dominoes
will fall no more,

01:08:31.814 --> 01:08:33.334
and the ramparts
will remain upright.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:34.934
Sir, General
Esperanza's plane

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.844
just came
on the scope.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.384
Attention, Dulles Tower.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:47.724
We will be
lighting up a runway.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:51.354
Do not, repeat, do not
attempt to land any planes.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:54.365
Remember,
we're monitoring you.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:58.755
What do we do?

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:00.965
Obey.

01:09:07.115 --> 01:09:10.705
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.545
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

01:09:12.656 --> 01:09:14.386
This is Fox Trot
Michael One, Dulles.

01:09:14.486 --> 01:09:15.916
We read you. Over.

01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:18.386
Fox Trot Michael One,
you are to come in

01:09:18.496 --> 01:09:21.895
on runway 1-5,
repeat, 1-5.

01:09:35.807 --> 01:09:37.837
I found it on the floor,
by the coat,

01:09:37.947 --> 01:09:39.846
next to
the luggage belt.

01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:42.346
What the hell you so excited
about that for?

01:09:42.447 --> 01:09:43.886
The code's still punched
into this one.

01:09:43.987 --> 01:09:45.346
You like it, huh?

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.546
How about giving me
20 bucks for it?

01:09:47.657 --> 01:09:49.846
How about
I let you live?

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:53.517
Man knows how
to bargain.

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:56.027
This is contrary
to our instructions.

01:09:56.127 --> 01:09:58.928
We are to land
at runway 1-0,

01:09:59.038 --> 01:10:00.018
where we are
to be met

01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:02.898
by representatives
of your justice de--

01:10:03.008 --> 01:10:04.868
Captain, please
tell the tower

01:10:04.978 --> 01:10:07.408
you will proceed
as ordered.

01:10:18.418 --> 01:10:20.649
Roger, Dulles.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:23.319
Proceeding
to runway 1-5.

01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:41.340
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:44.350
What are you
going to do now?

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:45.850
Are you going
to shoot me?

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.280
So who will
fly the plane?

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.850
Don't worry about it.

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:50.680
It's not your problem.

01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.820
Michael One.
Do you copy?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.271
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:15.471
Eagle Nest.

01:11:15.581 --> 01:11:17.381
This is Falcon.
Mayday.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:20.421
Eagle Nest.
This is Falcon. Mayday!

01:11:22.251 --> 01:11:23.881
Go ahead, Falcon.

01:11:23.991 --> 01:11:27.052
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

01:11:27.162 --> 01:11:30.022
I must drop out
of this weather and land now,

01:11:30.132 --> 01:11:32.032
on the first
accessible runway.

01:11:32.132 --> 01:11:33.432
Repeat.

01:11:33.532 --> 01:11:36.432
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:38.502
I must drop out
of the storm.

01:11:38.602 --> 01:11:40.832
I can land,
but I must land now,

01:11:40.942 --> 01:11:43.002
on the first
outgoing runway.

01:11:43.112 --> 01:11:45.872
Repeat. I cannot
circle around

01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:47.442
to runway 1-5.

01:11:50.953 --> 01:11:52.853
I'll make you
a deal, Marvin.

01:11:52.953 --> 01:11:54.853
You show me a shortcut
out to those runways,

01:11:54.953 --> 01:11:56.323
and I'll get you
a liner for that coat.

01:11:56.423 --> 01:11:59.583
Repeat. I cannot circle around
to runway 1-5.

01:11:59.693 --> 01:12:00.593
Shit.

01:12:00.693 --> 01:12:01.923
Stand by, Falcon.

01:12:03.963 --> 01:12:04.863
Here, sir.

01:12:04.963 --> 01:12:06.623
He's coming in
from the ocean.

01:12:08.973 --> 01:12:11.374
A bullet
has damaged my instruments.

01:12:11.474 --> 01:12:13.374
I'm not sure
of my bearings,

01:12:13.474 --> 01:12:15.774
and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.364
Do you copy, Eagle Nest?

01:12:17.474 --> 01:12:18.674
Roger, Falcon.

01:12:18.784 --> 01:12:20.614
That would be
2-5 right.

01:12:20.714 --> 01:12:22.874
Repeat. 2-5 right.

01:12:22.984 --> 01:12:26.214
Make up
your fucking mind!

01:12:26.324 --> 01:12:29.224
Oh, we are just up to our ass
in terrorists again,John.

01:12:29.324 --> 01:12:30.754
Affirmative.
2-5 right. Over.

01:12:30.854 --> 01:12:32.255
2-5 right.

01:12:34.765 --> 01:12:35.925
I've got to quit
smoking cigarettes.

01:12:37.495 --> 01:12:39.435
Thank you for telling me,
Eagle Nest.

01:12:39.535 --> 01:12:41.725
But if you could
show it to me as well,

01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:43.495
I would be grateful.

01:12:54.185 --> 01:12:55.586
I see the lights.

01:12:55.686 --> 01:12:57.916
They are directly
in front of me.

01:12:58.016 --> 01:12:59.416
Gracias, compadre.

01:12:59.526 --> 01:13:02.426
Reducing air speed.
Approaching runway.

01:13:02.526 --> 01:13:03.926
Wish me luck.

01:13:04.026 --> 01:13:05.516
Roger, Falcon.

01:13:06.696 --> 01:13:09.066
We copy. We'll have you
in five minutes.

01:13:09.166 --> 01:13:10.566
That's right, asshole.

01:13:10.666 --> 01:13:12.366
We'll have you
in five minutes.

01:13:35.997 --> 01:13:37.897
I see your lights.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:39.558
ETA 90 seconds.

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:50.978
Come to papa, scumbag.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.280
Uhh!

01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:47.461
Oh, shit!

01:14:48.941 --> 01:14:49.991
Unh! Oh.

01:14:58.381 --> 01:14:59.781
No!

01:15:47.663 --> 01:15:48.923
Freedom.

01:15:50.663 --> 01:15:51.964
Not yet.

01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.394
You're supposed
to stay in your seat

01:15:55.504 --> 01:15:56.904
until the plane
reaches the terminal.

01:15:57.004 --> 01:15:59.604
No frequent-flier
mileage for you.

01:15:59.714 --> 01:16:00.804
Who are you?

01:16:00.914 --> 01:16:01.974
A cop.

01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:02.974
A cop?

01:16:03.084 --> 01:16:03.974
Yeah, one of
the good guys.

01:16:04.084 --> 01:16:05.704
You're one of
the bad guys,

01:16:05.814 --> 01:16:07.404
and now that I got
your sorry ass,

01:16:07.514 --> 01:16:08.614
I'm going to trade it
for my wife.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:18.855
Sit down!

01:16:22.365 --> 01:16:24.395
Go in!

01:16:30.075 --> 01:16:30.975
Where did he go?

01:16:31.075 --> 01:16:32.065
In there.

01:16:42.286 --> 01:16:43.186
I don't believe this.

01:16:43.286 --> 01:16:44.886
Two months
of planning,

01:16:44.986 --> 01:16:46.886
and you can't anticipate
one pendejo of a cop.

01:16:46.996 --> 01:16:47.886
Come on, General.

01:16:47.996 --> 01:16:49.396
Where the hell
is Colonel Stuart?

01:16:53.496 --> 01:16:54.396
General!

01:16:54.496 --> 01:16:55.656
Ah! I'm all right.

01:16:55.766 --> 01:16:57.896
He said he was
a policeman.

01:16:58.006 --> 01:16:59.767
I thought you had
this place secured.

01:16:59.877 --> 01:17:01.897
He went in the cockpit.

01:17:02.007 --> 01:17:03.877
He's going to hell!

01:17:04.007 --> 01:17:05.107
McClane!

01:17:05.207 --> 01:17:08.907
I assume
it's you, McClane.

01:17:09.017 --> 01:17:11.417
You're quite
a little soldier.

01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:15.507
You can consider this
a military funeral!

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.438
Aah!

01:17:38.608 --> 01:17:40.948
How many grenades
we got?

01:17:41.048 --> 01:17:43.209
Three each!

01:17:43.319 --> 01:17:44.379
Use them!

01:17:54.499 --> 01:17:55.829
Oh, my--

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.240
Go!

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.861
Aah!

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:30.521
Oh, shit!

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:41.381
You lucky fuck.

01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:45.911
Fire trucks, sir.

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:48.981
Fall back
to the church. Now!

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:13.033
Where's the fucking door?

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.363
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

01:19:29.463 --> 01:19:30.863
In fact, so am I.

01:19:30.963 --> 01:19:32.363
We're right over
Washington.

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:33.663
See if you
can get any TV.

01:19:33.763 --> 01:19:34.734
That will
settle them down.

01:19:34.834 --> 01:19:37.704
Works for me.
I'll--

01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:02.295
Writing
your acceptance speech

01:20:02.395 --> 01:20:04.295
for the Video Sleaze
Awards?

01:20:04.395 --> 01:20:05.885
Try Pulitzer.

01:20:06.005 --> 01:20:07.335
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.925
while waiting to land,
our cabin attendants

01:20:10.035 --> 01:20:11.235
are turning on
local Washington broadcasting.

01:20:11.335 --> 01:20:13.275
The sound is on channel three.

01:20:19.946 --> 01:20:20.846
O.K.

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:22.576
O.K., O.K.

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:33.356
Please, sir, we may
land at any moment.

01:20:33.466 --> 01:20:34.866
If you'll
take your seat--

01:20:34.966 --> 01:20:36.366
I'm going to be sick.

01:20:36.466 --> 01:20:37.766
Excuse me.
I'm going to be sick.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.956
Sir, the seat belt
light is on.

01:20:43.907 --> 01:20:45.277
Moron.

01:20:45.377 --> 01:20:46.277
WZDC.

01:20:46.377 --> 01:20:47.307
Yes, this is
Richard Thornberg.

01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:48.537
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

01:20:48.647 --> 01:20:49.877
Uh, he's
about to go live.

01:20:49.977 --> 01:20:51.377
I know he's
about to go on.

01:20:51.477 --> 01:20:52.877
That's why I need him.

01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:54.377
You'll have to hold on--

01:20:54.487 --> 01:20:55.887
Put me through, Celia,

01:20:55.987 --> 01:20:57.617
or start typing
your resume.

01:20:57.717 --> 01:20:57.817
Esperanza's down--

01:20:57.817 --> 01:21:00.287
Esperanza's down--

01:21:00.387 --> 01:21:02.377
But he's hurt.

01:21:02.497 --> 01:21:04.398
He took a round
in his shoulder.

01:21:04.498 --> 01:21:06.398
Plus I got
one more of their guys.

01:21:06.498 --> 01:21:08.188
That's six
they lost altogether.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:09.888
Maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.228
we could get excited,

01:21:11.338 --> 01:21:12.458
but if they got 50 guys,

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:15.038
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!

01:21:15.138 --> 01:21:16.568
Now, we appreciate
your effort, McClane,

01:21:16.678 --> 01:21:19.078
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!

01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:20.338
What if they decide
to crash another plane

01:21:20.448 --> 01:21:22.348
in retaliation
for your little stunt?

01:21:22.448 --> 01:21:24.348
They can't do that
anymore, right, Barnes?

01:21:24.448 --> 01:21:26.349
Besides, if I
grabbed Esperanza,

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:27.709
this would
all be over by now.

01:21:27.819 --> 01:21:29.339
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative

01:21:29.459 --> 01:21:30.439
than you think!

01:21:30.559 --> 01:21:32.819
Well, at least
I'm thinking, goddamn it!

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:34.359
Listen, you wise-ass,

01:21:34.459 --> 01:21:35.519
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker

01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:36.649
until he tries
to take off.

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:37.659
Period!

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.359
Now, you're the wrong guy

01:21:39.469 --> 01:21:40.859
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

01:21:42.969 --> 01:21:44.769
The story of my life.

01:21:45.939 --> 01:21:46.909
Major,

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:48.410
Pentagon situation room,
sir!

01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:49.410
Pentagon.

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.410
I'll take it
in here.

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:52.570
Thank you, Telford.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.410
You men
come with me.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:57.880
McClane.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:58.880
Yeah, Barnes.

01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:00.380
You said those guys

01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:01.850
showed up out there
right away?

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.050
Yeah.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.920
That means they're
on the field or close,

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.420
and I think
I know where.

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.461
Come here. Let me
show you something.

01:22:11.031 --> 01:22:12.431
These are the old plans

01:22:12.531 --> 01:22:14.431
when the longer
runways went in.

01:22:14.531 --> 01:22:15.901
That's 12 years ago.

01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:18.441
Looks like they've done
some modifications on site--

01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:20.441
moved Tra Con phones, I LS,

01:22:20.541 --> 01:22:21.941
all the underground stuff

01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:23.941
so they could
handle drainage.

01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.441
If I'm right,

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.941
all of it would run
right along the airport property

01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:31.141
and go right past
this neighborhood.

01:22:33.952 --> 01:22:35.942
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

01:22:36.062 --> 01:22:38.962
I understand,
but if you just relax...

01:22:39.062 --> 01:22:40.962
It's hopeless.

01:22:41.062 --> 01:22:42.962
Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,

01:22:43.062 --> 01:22:45.262
that's for sure.

01:22:45.362 --> 01:22:46.592
Well, unfortunately,

01:22:46.702 --> 01:22:48.962
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

01:22:49.072 --> 01:22:51.972
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

01:22:52.072 --> 01:22:53.973
I should have
taken the bus.

01:22:54.073 --> 01:22:56.973
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:58.173
Excuse me.

01:22:58.283 --> 01:23:00.143
Yes?

01:23:00.253 --> 01:23:01.653
I was just wondering.

01:23:01.753 --> 01:23:03.153
This flight originally

01:23:03.253 --> 01:23:06.483
was supposed to be
51/2 hours, right?

01:23:06.593 --> 01:23:07.483
Mm-hmm.

01:23:07.593 --> 01:23:08.753
Do we have
enough fuel

01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:09.983
to keep circling
like this?

01:23:10.093 --> 01:23:11.323
Oh, of course.

01:23:11.423 --> 01:23:14.453
They anticipate
little problems like this.

01:23:31.384 --> 01:23:33.214
Barnes, we looked
at 12 fucking houses,

01:23:33.314 --> 01:23:34.644
and we're nowhere.

01:23:34.754 --> 01:23:37.554
This is
our last possibility.

01:23:37.654 --> 01:23:39.715
Over here there's
an old church.

01:23:39.825 --> 01:23:41.455
Let's go.

01:23:45.565 --> 01:23:47.055
Wait.

01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:56.565
There's the church
over there.

01:24:04.116 --> 01:24:06.206
Could be a sentry.

01:24:06.316 --> 01:24:07.946
And he could just be
out for a walk.

01:24:08.056 --> 01:24:10.526
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:14.146
Come on.

01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:17.526
All right.

01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:20.356
Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.

01:24:20.466 --> 01:24:22.096
I thought
they were the army.

01:24:22.196 --> 01:24:24.757
Who gives a fuck?
Just be ready.

01:24:41.817 --> 01:24:43.117
Oh, shit.

01:24:43.227 --> 01:24:45.318
Not now.

01:24:47.058 --> 01:24:49.118
Aah!

01:24:59.538 --> 01:25:00.978
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

01:25:01.078 --> 01:25:02.978
Barnes, where the hell
did you go?

01:25:03.078 --> 01:25:03.978
Where's McClane?

01:25:04.078 --> 01:25:05.008
He's with me.

01:25:05.108 --> 01:25:06.208
We're at the Hidey Lake
Community Church

01:25:06.318 --> 01:25:07.249
on the west side
of the airport.

01:25:07.349 --> 01:25:08.979
You're where?
Goddamn it!

01:25:09.079 --> 01:25:10.479
You crazy idiot,
why didn't--

01:25:10.589 --> 01:25:11.989
This must be their
base of operations.

01:25:12.089 --> 01:25:13.489
Shut up and get
your ass over here!

01:25:13.589 --> 01:25:14.489
Move it!

01:25:14.589 --> 01:25:15.989
Code red! Sit rep.

01:25:16.089 --> 01:25:18.419
We got positive I.D.
on Stuart's location.

01:25:18.529 --> 01:25:19.429
Let's move.

01:25:19.529 --> 01:25:21.389
Yo!

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.770
Our escape plane
will be ready

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.440
within 30 minutes,
General.

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.310
If there are
no more surprises.

01:25:53.461 --> 01:25:55.931
Gentlemen, we have
a situation here.

01:26:43.483 --> 01:26:46.043
Aah!

01:26:55.623 --> 01:26:56.613
Oh!

01:27:14.184 --> 01:27:15.374
Over here.

01:27:27.525 --> 01:27:30.255
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

01:27:30.365 --> 01:27:32.195
What the hell you think
you're doing out there,

01:27:32.295 --> 01:27:33.765
playing John Wayne?

01:27:33.865 --> 01:27:35.995
How would you like
to spend the night in a cell?

01:27:36.105 --> 01:27:38.295
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

01:27:38.405 --> 01:27:39.595
Go seal off the street.

01:27:39.705 --> 01:27:41.765
Hey, you can't
talk to me like that.

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:43.176
Oh, no, Carmine?

01:27:43.276 --> 01:27:45.106
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat

01:27:45.216 --> 01:27:46.976
out of Mr. McClane's
face now.

01:27:47.086 --> 01:27:48.946
With pleasure, sir.

01:27:50.716 --> 01:27:52.776
Major...

01:27:52.886 --> 01:27:54.116
the men are
in position, sir.

01:27:54.226 --> 01:27:56.126
Close up the back.
Then we go in.

01:27:56.226 --> 01:27:57.626
Fire only on my order.

01:27:57.726 --> 01:27:59.126
Roger that, sir.

01:27:59.226 --> 01:28:01.096
Guess I was
wrong about you.

01:28:01.196 --> 01:28:03.666
You're not such
an asshole after all.

01:28:03.766 --> 01:28:05.167
No, you were right.

01:28:05.267 --> 01:28:07.237
I'm just your kind
of asshole.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:18.377
Garber, sit rep!

01:28:18.477 --> 01:28:20.677
Army Special Forces
on three sides,

01:28:20.787 --> 01:28:22.337
closing in fast
around the back!

01:28:22.447 --> 01:28:23.787
Another problem,
Colonel?

01:28:23.887 --> 01:28:25.877
No problem, General.

01:28:25.987 --> 01:28:28.978
Gentlemen,
you know what to do.

01:28:39.738 --> 01:28:40.638
Down!

01:28:40.738 --> 01:28:42.068
Get down! Get down!

01:29:10.039 --> 01:29:13.700
General...it's time.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.970
Come on, let's move it!

01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:40.091
They're pulling out
out the back!

01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.931
Move it!

01:29:59.492 --> 01:30:01.982
Albertson, take your men
around the back.

01:30:08.692 --> 01:30:10.662
Aah!

01:30:15.172 --> 01:30:17.763
Aah!

01:30:27.453 --> 01:30:30.113
This equipment,
it could land our planes.

01:30:30.223 --> 01:30:32.913
There were trip wires outside.
They could have booby-trapped--

01:30:33.023 --> 01:30:33.923
They did.

01:30:34.023 --> 01:30:34.993
Got one here, too.

01:30:35.093 --> 01:30:36.653
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

01:30:36.763 --> 01:30:40.054
Clear the area!
Everybody, now!

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:44.594
They booby-trapped
all the equipment.

01:30:44.704 --> 01:30:46.104
Seal off
the building!

01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:47.604
Shit!

01:30:47.704 --> 01:30:49.604
Post sentries.
No civilians allowed.

01:30:49.704 --> 01:30:53.034
Hey, where the fuck
is McClane?

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:43.426
Miller, take him!

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:48.027
I'll cover you!

01:32:22.668 --> 01:32:27.668
Aah!

01:32:33.749 --> 01:32:37.049
So much
for the element of chance.

01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:38.619
Let's move out.

01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:48.249
Ohh...

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.160
I had the bastard
in my sights.

01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:00.260
I know I did.

01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:11.690
Oh,Jesus Christ.

01:33:16.861 --> 01:33:19.121
Attention, Tower.
Attention, Dulles Tower.

01:33:19.231 --> 01:33:22.131
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?

01:33:22.231 --> 01:33:24.131
It is.
It's in hangar 11.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.431
It's the most
remote building we've got.

01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:29.531
We're on our way.

01:33:29.641 --> 01:33:31.611
Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition

01:33:31.711 --> 01:33:33.141
of the plane.

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:36.111
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.942
Colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.

01:33:39.052 --> 01:33:40.952
Now, please, don't ask us

01:33:41.052 --> 01:33:43.142
to gift-wrap potential
hostages for you.

01:33:43.252 --> 01:33:44.652
Major Grant,
isn't it?

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:46.382
If you remember me,
Colonel,

01:33:46.492 --> 01:33:50.022
then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.

01:33:50.132 --> 01:33:52.152
Check out
your own fucking plane.

01:33:52.262 --> 01:33:54.662
We move out
in five minutes.

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.162
Flak jackets
for everybody.

01:33:56.262 --> 01:33:58.662
Body armor for
the assault team.

01:33:58.772 --> 01:34:00.173
Night scopes
for the snipers.

01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.173
We will take them
in the hangar,

01:34:02.273 --> 01:34:04.173
and I will
pull that detonator

01:34:04.273 --> 01:34:07.173
out of Stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.

01:34:07.283 --> 01:34:10.643
Take all your men
back to the airport.

01:34:10.753 --> 01:34:12.153
Seal off every exit

01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:13.683
in case they try
to slip past us

01:34:13.783 --> 01:34:15.683
to break out
onto the ground.

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:17.153
You got it.

01:34:19.193 --> 01:34:20.983
All right,
here we go.

01:34:21.093 --> 01:34:22.284
Dick, this is nuts.

01:34:22.394 --> 01:34:23.624
Every station in town
has people out at the airport,

01:34:23.734 --> 01:34:25.124
and none of them has
heard even a whisper

01:34:25.234 --> 01:34:26.634
of this shit
you're running now!

01:34:26.734 --> 01:34:28.564
Well,
none of them is me.

01:34:28.664 --> 01:34:30.324
You want proof,
try this.

01:34:30.434 --> 01:34:33.834
Repeat. Terrorists
have murdered civilians

01:34:33.944 --> 01:34:36.934
and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

01:34:37.044 --> 01:34:39.134
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

01:34:39.244 --> 01:34:40.504
and preparing
to take out the terrorists.

01:34:40.614 --> 01:34:41.514
Jesus Christ.

01:34:41.614 --> 01:34:43.645
I want you
to go live now.

01:34:43.755 --> 01:34:45.715
Get me in from the files--
a publicity shot.

01:34:45.815 --> 01:34:47.845
Connie's got one.
The maps--get one from weather.

01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:49.145
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

01:34:49.255 --> 01:34:50.655
Tell the affiliates
if they want in,

01:34:50.755 --> 01:34:52.155
they got three minutes
to shout.

01:34:52.255 --> 01:34:54.595
Let's do this.

01:34:54.695 --> 01:34:57.185
Network, here I come.

01:35:00.335 --> 01:35:01.305
Hey, Telford,

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:03.165
what was your
chicken shit outfit doing

01:35:03.275 --> 01:35:04.795
while we
were taking Grenada?

01:35:04.905 --> 01:35:06.706
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

01:35:06.806 --> 01:35:09.206
Grenada-- five minutes
of fire fight,

01:35:09.306 --> 01:35:12.006
five weeks of surfing.

01:35:12.116 --> 01:35:14.086
I wish I was
with you guys for that.

01:35:14.186 --> 01:35:16.176
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

01:35:16.286 --> 01:35:17.616
Really, sir?

01:35:17.716 --> 01:35:19.416
Sure.

01:35:19.516 --> 01:35:22.186
Then we wouldn't
have to do this.

01:35:37.577 --> 01:35:40.137
Eagle Nest,
this is Hatchling.

01:35:40.247 --> 01:35:44.267
On schedule...
and in position.

01:35:44.377 --> 01:35:46.647
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

01:35:46.747 --> 01:35:48.647
You have
a green light.

01:35:48.747 --> 01:35:52.478
I repeat, a green light.

01:36:00.268 --> 01:36:01.698
Oh!

01:36:03.268 --> 01:36:05.668
Jesus, Officer,
where did you come from,

01:36:05.768 --> 01:36:07.168
Pearl Harbor?

01:36:07.268 --> 01:36:08.758
Uh!

01:36:11.308 --> 01:36:14.709
All right,
let's clear it out, please.

01:36:15.809 --> 01:36:17.609
Stand by.

01:36:17.719 --> 01:36:20.309
5, 4, 3...

01:36:20.419 --> 01:36:24.009
This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

01:36:24.119 --> 01:36:25.609
There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles,

01:36:25.719 --> 01:36:27.689
where other aircraft
continue to circle,

01:36:27.789 --> 01:36:30.689
with no explanation from
airport or FAA officials.

01:36:30.799 --> 01:36:33.699
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,

01:36:33.799 --> 01:36:37.630
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.170
I'm one of the thousand people

01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:42.300
who has been circling
our nation's capital

01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:44.140
under the assumption
that whatever problem

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.040
was going on far below
was a normal one,

01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:49.140
but the truth
is far from normal.

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:51.370
The truth is terrifying.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.680
Look out!
Lady, look out!

01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:55.720
Look out! Look out!

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:58.081
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

01:36:58.191 --> 01:36:59.161
Ho!

01:36:59.261 --> 01:37:00.161
Get out of the way!

01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:02.351
Get out
of the way, lady!

01:37:02.461 --> 01:37:04.161
Go, go, go!
Hey, hey, look out!

01:37:04.261 --> 01:37:06.161
This is a recording
of a conversation

01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:09.431
between Dulles Tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:13.761
Get out of the way!

01:37:15.511 --> 01:37:16.671
Lorenzo!

01:37:16.781 --> 01:37:18.111
McClane, are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:37:18.211 --> 01:37:20.112
The Blue Light team--
where are they?

01:37:20.212 --> 01:37:21.772
Stuart's got explosives
in the church rigged with a remote.

01:37:21.882 --> 01:37:23.012
Where's Grant?

01:37:23.112 --> 01:37:24.452
They're going to kill
that son of a bitch

01:37:24.552 --> 01:37:25.612
and get it from them!

01:37:25.722 --> 01:37:26.812
They're not
going to do that!

01:37:26.922 --> 01:37:28.082
They're going to
get on the same plane with him

01:37:28.192 --> 01:37:29.122
and take off
with him!

01:37:29.222 --> 01:37:30.282
Get the fuck
out of here!

01:37:30.392 --> 01:37:32.292
When the army
canned Stuart,

01:37:32.392 --> 01:37:33.452
he loaded that unit
with his own men!

01:37:33.562 --> 01:37:35.252
Are you nuts?
That fire fight--

01:37:35.362 --> 01:37:36.792
Sideshow to buy
them some time.

01:37:36.902 --> 01:37:40.232
McClane, you are
completely around the fucking bend.

01:37:40.332 --> 01:37:41.703
You're under arrest,
you motherfucker.

01:37:48.173 --> 01:37:49.643
Here! These
are the bullets

01:37:49.743 --> 01:37:51.073
they used
out there tonight!

01:37:51.183 --> 01:37:53.243
Blanks!

01:37:54.753 --> 01:37:57.243
Jesus Christ.

01:38:04.264 --> 01:38:06.884
This is Chief Lorenzo.

01:38:06.994 --> 01:38:08.154
I want
every officer recalled

01:38:08.264 --> 01:38:10.164
and assembled in body armor
and full weaponry

01:38:10.264 --> 01:38:12.424
in the motor pool
in five minutes.

01:38:13.734 --> 01:38:17.434
It's time to kick ass.

01:38:19.274 --> 01:38:21.644
Just like IwoJima!

01:38:21.744 --> 01:38:24.944
This reporter has learned
that the terrorists

01:38:25.044 --> 01:38:27.015
have virtual control
of the entire airport,

01:38:27.115 --> 01:38:30.175
a fact that the authorities
have repressed.

01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:32.185
The terrorists
promise more bloodshed

01:38:32.285 --> 01:38:34.485
unless their demands
are met,

01:38:34.595 --> 01:38:36.615
and now that
the Special Army commandos

01:38:36.725 --> 01:38:38.125
have arrived at the airport,

01:38:38.225 --> 01:38:40.125
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle

01:38:40.235 --> 01:38:42.755
is dangerously close.

01:39:03.016 --> 01:39:06.146
That stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.

01:39:06.256 --> 01:39:09.056
It's all over the airport.

01:39:09.156 --> 01:39:11.057
300 people have died...

01:39:11.167 --> 01:39:13.567
When are we
going to land?

01:39:13.667 --> 01:39:16.157
...and unfortunately
they may not be the last.

01:39:16.267 --> 01:39:18.827
The horrifying fact
is that no one is safe,

01:39:18.937 --> 01:39:21.097
either in the planes
above Dulles

01:39:21.207 --> 01:39:23.607
or in the terminal below.

01:39:23.707 --> 01:39:27.107
The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport

01:39:27.217 --> 01:39:29.117
hangs over the heads
of everyone,

01:39:29.217 --> 01:39:31.117
and the holiday season
of peace and love

01:39:31.217 --> 01:39:33.588
has become a nightmare.

01:39:39.588 --> 01:39:40.988
All right, listen up!

01:39:41.098 --> 01:39:44.118
All units, I want you
to converge on hangar 11,

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:45.628
all sides!

01:39:45.728 --> 01:39:47.628
This car, McClane!
Get in!

01:39:47.738 --> 01:39:50.498
When the City Blue
show up with their backup,

01:39:50.608 --> 01:39:52.128
they'll pick up
the pieces!

01:39:52.238 --> 01:39:54.068
Now, move out!

01:39:54.179 --> 01:39:58.109
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

01:39:58.209 --> 01:39:59.769
Merry Christmas.

01:39:59.879 --> 01:40:01.409
Hi.

01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:09.149
Goddamn it
to hell!

01:40:09.259 --> 01:40:11.889
Move that
piece of shit!

01:40:11.989 --> 01:40:15.019
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit

01:40:15.129 --> 01:40:16.149
out of here?

01:40:16.259 --> 01:40:17.600
Vito, get the fuck
out of the car

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.600
and get your ass
in gear and help me.

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.000
Will you get--

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.540
Move that car
right now!

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.770
Right there.
Right there. Get that.

01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:27.870
Hey, Coleman!

01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:32.040
Sam! Sam Coleman!

01:40:32.150 --> 01:40:34.380
Hey, Coleman!

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.780
Hi!

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.320
Coleman!

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:42.121
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages

01:40:42.221 --> 01:40:45.621
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

01:40:45.731 --> 01:40:49.931
to put his life
and talent

01:40:50.031 --> 01:40:52.901
on the line for humanity
and country,

01:40:53.001 --> 01:40:55.971
and if this should be
my final broadcast--

01:40:58.241 --> 01:41:01.212
Amen to that...Dick.

01:41:01.312 --> 01:41:04.142
Dick? We're live, Dick.

01:41:04.252 --> 01:41:06.302
Where are you now?

01:41:06.412 --> 01:41:08.782
Dick?

01:41:08.882 --> 01:41:10.712
Truck lights
approaching, sir.

01:41:10.822 --> 01:41:14.152
They're here,
right on schedule.

01:41:14.262 --> 01:41:16.662
The hangar door,
open it.

01:41:16.762 --> 01:41:18.092
Clockwork.

01:41:41.223 --> 01:41:41.623
Jeez, you
give me this story,

01:41:41.623 --> 01:41:42.613
Jeez, you
give me this story,

01:41:42.723 --> 01:41:45.124
and I'll
have your baby.

01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:48.054
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

01:41:59.734 --> 01:42:03.144
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

01:42:03.244 --> 01:42:04.644
Thank you, Major.

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:06.644
You're not
so bad yourself.

01:42:06.744 --> 01:42:08.475
Congratulations
on your escape, sir.

01:42:08.585 --> 01:42:09.635
Thank you, Major.

01:42:09.745 --> 01:42:10.905
Maybe you
should save them

01:42:11.015 --> 01:42:12.075
until we
are all safe, hmm?

01:42:12.185 --> 01:42:13.755
Sir.

01:42:13.755 --> 01:42:15.655
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:17.155
You've won a victory
for our way of life,

01:42:17.255 --> 01:42:21.525
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

01:42:21.625 --> 01:42:23.255
Now, get on board.

01:42:52.327 --> 01:42:54.227
What's the matter,
cowboy, ride too rough?

01:42:54.327 --> 01:42:55.727
I don't
like to fly.

01:42:55.827 --> 01:42:57.227
Then what
are you doing here?

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:59.027
I don't like
to lose, either.

01:42:59.137 --> 01:43:01.567
O.K. Whoo! Here we go!

01:43:09.507 --> 01:43:11.447
I don't know
about you guys,

01:43:11.547 --> 01:43:13.407
but I've seen
enough fucking snow

01:43:13.517 --> 01:43:14.608
to last me
a lifetime.

01:43:14.718 --> 01:43:16.738
You don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

01:43:16.848 --> 01:43:19.548
For you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.

01:43:22.588 --> 01:43:24.058
Shit!
They left the hangar!

01:43:27.028 --> 01:43:28.458
Right there.

01:43:28.568 --> 01:43:30.398
Right there.
Get that.

01:43:30.498 --> 01:43:31.398
All right, now what?

01:43:31.498 --> 01:43:32.698
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

01:43:32.798 --> 01:43:34.898
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:36.499
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

01:43:36.609 --> 01:43:37.869
I'm crazy, man,
but I ain't that crazy.

01:43:37.979 --> 01:43:39.029
Forget it.

01:43:39.139 --> 01:43:40.699
Dulles,
this is Northeast 140.

01:43:40.809 --> 01:43:42.039
Request clearance
on first available runway.

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.239
That's Holly's plane.

01:43:43.349 --> 01:43:45.749
Repeat. Request
emergency clearance.

01:43:45.849 --> 01:43:46.869
I know you're
not going to answer me,

01:43:46.989 --> 01:43:48.109
but you damn well
better listen!

01:43:48.219 --> 01:43:50.209
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land,

01:43:50.319 --> 01:43:51.549
and in five minutes
we're coming in

01:43:51.659 --> 01:43:53.059
one way or another.

01:43:53.159 --> 01:43:54.389
That's my wife's
plane!

01:43:54.489 --> 01:43:55.789
Take it
fucking down!

01:43:55.889 --> 01:43:57.329
I'm not getting
in front of that plane!

01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.820
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:07.540
Your attention.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:08.730
We have no choice

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.070
but to attempt
an emergency landing.

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.580
Please fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.080
as instructed
by your cabin attendants.

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.580
Let's have
the emergency check list.

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:21.121
Attention all air traffic
in Dulles area.

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.621
This is Northeast 140.

01:44:22.721 --> 01:44:24.241
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

01:44:24.361 --> 01:44:25.481
Be advised.

01:44:28.361 --> 01:44:29.761
I don't want to die.

01:44:29.861 --> 01:44:31.691
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

01:44:31.801 --> 01:44:33.201
Just buckle
your seat belt.

01:44:33.301 --> 01:44:35.201
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:44:35.301 --> 01:44:36.431
Lean forward.

01:44:37.801 --> 01:44:39.931
God!

01:44:40.041 --> 01:44:42.011
Oh!

01:44:44.882 --> 01:44:46.812
Oh, God.

01:44:46.912 --> 01:44:48.212
O God,

01:44:48.312 --> 01:44:52.112
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:44:59.882
Just hang on!

01:44:59.992 --> 01:45:01.862
What are you doing?

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:02.932
You wanted a story,
didn't you?

01:45:03.032 --> 01:45:04.022
Nice and easy, boys.

01:45:04.132 --> 01:45:05.223
Get me in low!

01:45:05.333 --> 01:45:06.853
You got it!

01:45:08.773 --> 01:45:10.733
Bring me down!

01:45:10.843 --> 01:45:12.233
You'll get
yourself killed!

01:45:12.343 --> 01:45:14.803
Come back inside!

01:45:21.183 --> 01:45:23.243
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

01:45:30.794 --> 01:45:33.224
Lower!

01:45:33.324 --> 01:45:34.224
Aah!

01:45:42.834 --> 01:45:45.434
John, what the fuck
are you doing

01:45:45.544 --> 01:45:48.514
out on the wing
of this plane?

01:45:53.485 --> 01:45:54.745
Damn!

01:46:00.525 --> 01:46:02.115
Mierda.

01:46:02.225 --> 01:46:03.595
There's
something wrong.

01:46:03.695 --> 01:46:06.385
The ailerons.

01:46:06.495 --> 01:46:08.555
We can't
take off.

01:46:11.536 --> 01:46:12.466
Hijo de puta.

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.336
It's McClane again.

01:46:16.076 --> 01:46:17.306
Son of a bitch!

01:46:18.406 --> 01:46:21.246
I'll do him.

01:46:21.346 --> 01:46:22.606
This time
do it right.

01:46:22.716 --> 01:46:24.616
You just get us
in the air, General.

01:46:24.716 --> 01:46:26.276
You're the only man
who can do it.

01:46:26.386 --> 01:46:28.176
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

01:46:54.277 --> 01:46:55.177
Ya!

01:47:20.809 --> 01:47:23.499
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

01:47:27.579 --> 01:47:28.549
Whoa!

01:47:31.289 --> 01:47:33.619
I got enough friends!

01:47:36.389 --> 01:47:37.909
Aah!

01:48:10.521 --> 01:48:12.251
O.K., McClane...

01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:13.851
time for
the main event!

01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:20.601
Aah!

01:48:22.971 --> 01:48:23.871
Aah!

01:48:49.733 --> 01:48:51.603
Motherfucker!

01:48:59.413 --> 01:49:00.703
Oh!

01:49:02.183 --> 01:49:03.373
Ha ha ha!

01:49:03.483 --> 01:49:04.443
How's it going?

01:49:08.323 --> 01:49:09.874
Bon voyage!

01:49:16.324 --> 01:49:19.354
Happy landings, asshole!

01:50:09.786 --> 01:50:12.186
Yippie-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

01:50:25.067 --> 01:50:26.727
Yeah. All right.

01:50:41.218 --> 01:50:42.448
Aah!

01:50:46.088 --> 01:50:48.678
Whoa!

01:50:54.268 --> 01:50:57.198
Ha ha ha!

01:50:57.298 --> 01:51:00.169
Oh!

01:51:03.809 --> 01:51:06.709
Holly!

01:51:06.809 --> 01:51:09.209
Here's your fucking
landing light!

01:51:09.309 --> 01:51:10.869
Whoo!

01:51:17.049 --> 01:51:18.719
Oh, God.

01:51:20.959 --> 01:51:22.430
Look!

01:51:22.530 --> 01:51:23.420
Look!

01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:26.720
O.K., I see it!
I see it!

01:51:50.691 --> 01:51:52.181
They used
the fire to see!

01:51:52.291 --> 01:51:53.621
They used
the fucking fire to see!

01:51:53.721 --> 01:51:54.951
They can all do that.
Tell them.

01:51:55.061 --> 01:51:56.461
They already know.

01:51:56.561 --> 01:51:58.191
We had a visual
on Northeastern's landing.

01:51:58.301 --> 01:51:59.521
Listen.

01:51:59.631 --> 01:52:01.661
We're following the fire trail
in as a guide.

01:52:01.771 --> 01:52:02.991
If they can do it,
so can we!

01:52:20.352 --> 01:52:21.722
Whoo!

01:52:21.822 --> 01:52:23.222
If any landing
you can walk away from

01:52:23.322 --> 01:52:24.652
is a good one,
that's great.

01:52:24.762 --> 01:52:26.282
Whew!

01:52:48.353 --> 01:52:50.253
Oh!

01:52:54.554 --> 01:52:56.254
Jump!

01:52:56.354 --> 01:52:57.754
Jump!

01:52:57.864 --> 01:52:59.254
I got you!

01:52:59.364 --> 01:53:00.414
Jump!

01:53:29.295 --> 01:53:30.885
There you go.
That's it.

01:53:30.995 --> 01:53:33.515
There he is!

01:53:33.695 --> 01:53:34.825
That's it!

01:53:36.336 --> 01:53:39.736
Holly!

01:53:42.836 --> 01:53:46.176
Holly!

01:53:46.276 --> 01:53:48.336
Holly!

01:53:50.846 --> 01:53:54.046
Holly!

01:53:56.286 --> 01:53:59.817
Holly!

01:54:01.357 --> 01:54:04.817
Holly!

01:54:08.367 --> 01:54:12.197
Holly!

01:54:14.067 --> 01:54:16.167
Holly!

01:54:18.877 --> 01:54:22.078
Come on!
We got you!

01:54:22.178 --> 01:54:26.278
Oh! Oh!

01:54:26.388 --> 01:54:29.318
Oh, God.
Oh, baby.

01:54:29.418 --> 01:54:31.718
I thought I was never going
to see you again.

01:54:31.828 --> 01:54:34.158
That's what
I thought about you.

01:54:34.258 --> 01:54:36.918
I love you so much.

01:54:39.598 --> 01:54:42.499
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

01:54:42.599 --> 01:54:45.829
Yeah. I heard that, too.

01:54:53.609 --> 01:54:55.239
God, that's beautiful.

01:54:55.349 --> 01:54:57.249
Yeah.

01:54:58.349 --> 01:55:02.149
Yup, it sure is.

01:55:02.259 --> 01:55:05.190
Oh, I love you so much.

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.190
Oh,John.

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:11.920
Why does this
keep happening to us?

01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:20.030
Let's go home.

01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:22.340
Get in the truck!

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.270
Let's get her
out of here!

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.941
Somebody help me,
please!

01:55:27.051 --> 01:55:28.911
Oh, honey, help me
up here, please.

01:55:29.021 --> 01:55:30.511
Asshole!

01:55:34.121 --> 01:55:36.211
Hey, Officer!
Hey, come on!

01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:37.721
Hey, hey!

01:55:37.831 --> 01:55:40.731
Hop on in here!
Get your missus in!

01:55:40.831 --> 01:55:42.691
What do you say, Marv?

01:55:42.801 --> 01:55:46.561
I'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

01:55:46.671 --> 01:55:48.232
Ha ha ha!

01:55:53.842 --> 01:55:56.872
Hey, McClane!

01:55:56.982 --> 01:55:58.742
You get this
parking ticket

01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:00.142
in front
of my airport?

01:56:00.252 --> 01:56:03.182
Yeah.

01:56:03.282 --> 01:56:07.012
Ah, what the hell.
It's Christmas!

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.123
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #

01:56:12.233 --> 01:56:13.253
Take off, Marv!

01:56:13.363 --> 01:56:17.323
# But the fire
is so delightful #

01:56:17.433 --> 01:56:21.423
# And since we've
no place to go #

01:56:21.543 --> 01:56:25.443
# Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #

01:56:25.543 --> 01:56:29.033
# It doesn't show signs
of stopping #

01:56:29.143 --> 01:56:32.814
# And I brought some corn
for popping #

01:56:32.914 --> 01:56:36.474
# The lights are turned
way down low #

01:56:36.584 --> 01:56:40.214
# Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #

01:56:40.324 --> 01:56:44.054
# When we finally
kiss good night #

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:47.864
# How I hate
going out in the storm #

01:56:47.964 --> 01:56:52.094
# But if you'll
really hold me tight #

01:56:52.204 --> 01:56:55.765
# All the way home
I'll be warm #

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:59.245
# The fire is slowly dying #

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:02.975
# And, my dear,
we're still good-byeing #

01:57:03.085 --> 01:57:06.775

as you love me so #

01:57:06.885 --> 01:57:10.445
