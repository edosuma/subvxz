no matter how great,

00:12.930 --> 00:15.099

00:17.393 --> 00:20.605
He cannot glimpse his part
in the great story

00:20.688 --> 00:22.773
that is about to unfold.

00:24.108 --> 00:27.862
Like everyone, he must live and learn.

00:31.407 --> 00:36.495
And so it will be for the young warlock
arriving at the gates of Camelot.

00:38.915 --> 00:43.127
A boy that will in time father a legend.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.299

02:12.133 --> 02:15.094
Let this serve as a lesson to all.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.682
This man, Thomas James Collins,

02:19.765 --> 02:24.937
is adjudged guilty of conspiring
to use enchantments and magic.

02:25.896 --> 02:31.902
And pursuant to the Laws of Camelot,
I, Uther Pendragon,

02:31.986 --> 02:38.451
have decreed that such practices
are banned on penalty of death.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.705

02:42.788 --> 02:45.583

03:10.691 --> 03:11.859
(ALL EXCLAIM)

03:13.444 --> 03:19.617
When I came to this land
this kingdom was mired in chaos.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.996
But with the people's help
magic was driven from the realm.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.290
So I declare a festival

03:26.374 --> 03:30.544
to celebrate 20 years
since the Great Dragon was captured

03:30.628 --> 03:34.048
and Camelot freed
from the evil of sorcery!

You took my son,

04:04.912 --> 04:09.750
and I promise you,
before these celebrations are over,

04:09.834 --> 04:12.086
you will share my tears.

04:14.380 --> 04:20.845

-I don't.

Where did you study?

06:18.629 --> 06:19.630
Answer me.

-What do you want me to say?

06:24.802 --> 06:26.554
-The truth.
-I was born like this.

It is Wednesday.

06:51.495 --> 06:52.496
Ah.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.709
All right, then. Well,
you'd better put your bag in there.

-You won't say anything about...
-No.

Although, Merlin.

I turn to you for I feel lost and alone

08:03.734 --> 08:06.278

08:06.403 --> 08:09.823
It is every mother's fate
to think her child is special

that Merlin were not so.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.828

-You think?

thought you were a real hero.

-Mmm-hmm.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.094
-I know you're still angry with me.
-Your mother asked me

20:19.177 --> 20:21.763
-to look after you.
-Yes.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.934
What did your mother say to you
about your gifts?

20:27.060 --> 20:30.313
-That I was special.
-You are special.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.775
The likes of which
I've never seen before.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.488
-What do you mean?
-Well, magic requires incantations.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.992
Spells, it takes years of study.
What I saw you do was...

20:43.076 --> 20:45.453
Elemental. Instinctive.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.622
What's the point if it can't be used?

20:47.705 --> 20:50.208
That I do not know.

never been posed before, Merlin.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.888

21:03.972 --> 21:06.057
-Why?
-People used magic

21:06.141 --> 21:10.937
for the wrong end at that time.
It threw natural order into chaos.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.440

even the dragons.

-All of them?
-There was one dragon

21:18.695 --> 21:23.533

kept it as an example.

21:23.616 --> 21:28.371
He imprisoned it in a cave
deep beneath the castle.

Where no one can free it.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.627
Now, eat up.
When you've finished I need you

21:34.711 --> 21:38.923

23:22.318 --> 23:24.779
-From you?
-Oh, thank God,

23:24.862 --> 23:26.948
| thought you were deaf as well as dumb.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.158
Look, I've told you, you're an ass.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.245
| just didn't realize
you were a Royal one.

23:33.538 --> 23:37.500
Oh, what are you going to do?
Get your daddy's men to protect you?

23:39.252 --> 23:41.045
| could take you apart with one blow.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.381
| could take you apart
with less than that.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.133
Are you sure?

23:50.513 --> 23:52.640
Here you go, big man.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.853
Come on, then.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.399
| warn you, I've been trained
to kill since birth.

24:01.608 --> 24:05.361
Wow, and how long have you been training
to be a prat?

24:06.487 --> 24:09.282
-You can't address me like that.
-Sorry.

24:09.365 --> 24:13.161
How long have you been training
to be a prat, my Lord?

24:19.167 --> 24:22.420
Come on then, Merlin. Come on!

24:51.866 --> 24:54.327
-You're in trouble now.
-Oh, God!

25:11.177 --> 25:12.387
Ow!

25:25.983 --> 25:27.777
-Do you want to give up?
-To you?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.238
Do you? Do you want to give up?

25:43.459 --> 25:46.254
Wait. Let him go.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.382
He may be an idiot,
but he's a brave one.

25:50.425 --> 25:53.094
There's something about you, Merlin.

25:54.095 --> 25:56.514
| can't quite put my finger on it.

25:57.932 --> 26:00.601
How could you be so foolish?

26:00.685 --> 26:03.479
-He needed to be taught a lesson.
-Magic must be studied,

26:03.563 --> 26:06.649
mastered, and used for good.
Not for idiotic pranks.

26:06.733 --> 26:10.153
What is there to master? I could move
objects like that before I could talk.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.321
Then by now you should know
how to control yourself.

26:12.405 --> 26:16.284
| don't want to.
If I can't use magic, what have I got?

26:16.367 --> 26:20.037
I'm just a nobody, and always will be.

26:20.121 --> 26:24.417
If I can't use magic,
then I might as well die.

26:37.346 --> 26:41.392
Merlin. Sit up, take your shirt off.

(MERLIN GROANING)

26:55.364 --> 26:58.659
You don't know
why I was born like this, do you?

26:59.702 --> 27:00.787
No.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.123
I'm not a monster, am |?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.253
Don't ever think that.

27:09.754 --> 27:13.591
Then why am I like this?
Please. I need to know. Why?

27:15.301 --> 27:19.931
Maybe there's someone
with more knowledge than me.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.767
If you can't tell me, then no one can.

27:33.569 --> 27:37.740
Take this. It will help with the pain.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.139
-Will you sing for me tonight?
-You will have to wait, sire.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.725
-You will not deny me.
-I'm saving myself

28:04.809 --> 28:09.188
for my performance tomorrow.
Will everyone be there?

28:09.856 --> 28:13.526
-Who would dare to miss it?
-How about your son?

28:14.569 --> 28:17.947
-It seems a shame not to have met him.
-That's Arthur.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.784
-Poor child.
-Hmm?

28:21.868 --> 28:26.038
Poor child, it can't have been easy
to grow up without a mother.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.373
No.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.624
Hmm.

28:29.625 --> 28:34.714
That bond between mother and son
is s0 hard to replace.

28:35.006 --> 28:37.592
-Hasn't been easy.
-I'm sure.

28:42.346 --> 28:46.434
Perhaps if you found someone.
If you remarried.

28:48.436 --> 28:52.315
I'm sure you'd have
the pick of any lady in the kingdom.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.526
Perhaps I'll find love again.

28:55.610 --> 28:59.155
But I'm afraid it's too late
to replace Arthur's mother.

28:59.238 --> 29:03.576
Yes. It's certainly too late for Arthur.

How small you are,

32:17.478 --> 32:21.440
Why? What do you mean? What destiny?

32:22.233 --> 32:27.822
Your gift, Merlin,
was given to you for a reason.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.116
So there is a reason.

32:32.118 --> 32:37.665
Arthur is the once and future king
who will unite the land of Albion.

32:38.916 --> 32:42.128
-Right.
-But he faces many threats

32:42.211 --> 32:45.214
from friend and foe alike.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.133
| don't see what that has to do with me.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.592
Everything.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.595
Without you, Arthur will never succeed.

32:51.679 --> 32:56.767
-Without you, there'll be no Albion.
-No.

32:57.309 --> 33:01.480
-No, you've got this wrong.
-There is no right or wrong.

33:01.564 --> 33:04.817
-Only what is and what isn't.
-But I'm serious.

If anyone wants to go and kill him
they can go ahead.

In fact, I'll give them a hand.

And none of us can escape it.

33:20.875 --> 33:27.173
No, no way, no. There must be another
Arthur, because this one's an idiot.

33:27.256 --> 33:31.218
Perhaps it's your destiny
to change that.

-By magic?
-Yeah.

34:08.922 --> 34:12.051
Well, you can clear it up without magic.

34:12.134 --> 34:16.679
Then I want you to get me some herbs.
Henbane, wormwood and sorrel.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.141
And deliver this to Morgana.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.851
The poor girl's suffering
from nightmares.

about Arthur.

to the feast, does it?
