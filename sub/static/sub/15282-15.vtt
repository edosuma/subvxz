WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:07.500
They said that storm
was coming,

00:08.400 --> 00:09.600
And they weren't kidding.

00:12.100 --> 00:12.400
oh...

00:12.400 --> 00:13.500
How are we?

00:13.800 --> 00:15.200
Well, you know, it's hard.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.200
Just one foot
in front of the other.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.100
Thanks.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.800
It would have been
amy's birthday tomorrow.

00:23.700 --> 00:24.600
Paul?

00:25.200 --> 00:26.000
Hmm.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.800
He's been a rock.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.700
But you know how he is.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.800
His glass is always full.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.700
I think he's home.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.200
Well, the kids are with
grandma tonight.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.300
We have a night off.

00:40.100 --> 00:40.800
Yeah.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.100
God, we need it.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.100
Thank you.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.800
I appreciate the call, kate.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.400
You know, I... I should go.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, ok.

00:59.100 --> 00:59.800
Bye.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.600
Paul?

01:04.300 --> 01:06.700
Paul, i think the lightning
blew out the house.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.400
Paul.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.800
Honey? Paul?

01:26.500 --> 01:27.600
Paul?

01:29.300 --> 01:30.300
Paul.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.400
Honey?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.900
Paul, open the door.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.100
Honey?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.200
Unlock the door!

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
Paul!

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
Aah...

02:01.300 --> 02:03.500
Paul!

02:03.500 --> 02:05.000
Oh, my god!

02:41.800 --> 02:43.500
Agent jennifer jareau?

02:44.200 --> 02:45.500
A friend of mine
gave me your number,

02:45.500 --> 02:47.300
Said you might be able
to help.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.600
Ronnie baleman,
pittsburgh p.D.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.600
There's something
going on in my town.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.233
Something's not right.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
Got a case.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.700
So, you've either decided
we're taking the case

03:05.700 --> 03:08.400
Or this bag is headed
for another destination?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.600
I need a favor.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.500
Of course.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.400
I need some personal time,
no more than a day.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.600
Take all the time
you need.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.400
I need to talk to jack.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
I've lost her,
but i'm not gonna lose him.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.000
I need to try to...

03:25.100 --> 03:26.100
Tell him what's going on.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.600
I don't know how much
he's going to
understand, but...

03:28.800 --> 03:30.400
All he needs to understand...

03:30.500 --> 03:31.900
Is that you love him.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.800
I'll join you when i can.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.900
3 months ago a fire
in the shadyside rec center

03:55.900 --> 03:57.600
Killed 14 children.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I remember that.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.500
What does that
have to do with us?

04:00.800 --> 04:04.000
Well, over the past
3 months there's been
5 suicides.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.200
All of them lost a child
in the fire.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.900
The last one
was paul baleman.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.400
He was found electrocuted
in his bathtub yesterday.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.200
I received a request
for our help.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.700
Why do they need our help?
They're suicides.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.500
All of the suicides
were within 2 weeks
of each other.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.100
It could be
some kind of pattern.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
Detective ronnie baleman,
pittsburgh, p.D.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.800
Thinks that something's
going on.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.900
Well, of course he does.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.100
Why do you say that?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.900
He's related
to that man, right?

04:28.200 --> 04:29.100
His brother.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.400
A cop who doesn't
believe his brother
committed suicide.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.500
Come on, next case.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
Now, wait a second.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.600
5 suicides
in the same neighborhood

04:38.600 --> 04:39.700
Within months?

04:39.700 --> 04:41.200
That's a serious spike.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.700
Suicides don't spike
after a tragedy.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.800
Quite the opposite,
actually.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.400
Following world war i and ii,
right after kennedy was shot,

04:47.400 --> 04:48.600
And following 9/11,

04:48.600 --> 04:50.200
Suicides plummeted.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.000
Within a society,
external threats

04:52.000 --> 04:53.800
Usually create group
integrations.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.100
People come together.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.700
So if there's
reason for doubt,

04:57.700 --> 04:59.100
Which there obviously is,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.000
Don't those families
left behind

05:01.000 --> 05:02.300
Have a right to know?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.900
Yes, they do.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.600
Ok, sure,
they deserve to know,

05:06.600 --> 05:09.300
But let somebody else
tell them,
like social services.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.300
Contact detective baleman.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.000
Let him know we're coming.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.900
Http://www.Ragbear.Com

05:57.900 --> 06:01.300
Rossi: "there is no refuge
from confession but suicide,

06:02.100 --> 06:04.900
And suicide is confession."

06:05.300 --> 06:06.800
Daniel webster.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.800
Hotch would never
have taken this case.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.600
And i say case
in the loosest sense.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.500
We'll follow the facts
as they are without bias.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.200
Isn't that what we do?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.800
What facts, rossi?

06:19.100 --> 06:21.000
Look at us.
We don't have a single file.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.900
Ok, let me help you out.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.600
Jump right in anytime.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.700
Fact one...
There are no files,

06:27.700 --> 06:29.300
So it seems no case.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.300
But what if there is?

06:30.300 --> 06:33.400
One fire, 14 deaths,
5 suicides.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.500
All the suicides

06:34.500 --> 06:36.300
Are connected
to the original fire.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.200
And all exactly 2 weeks apart.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.500
Come on, derek,
you can't tell me

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
That doesn't feel
a lot like a pattern.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
Prentiss:
and a timeline.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
Right?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.600
A lot of people lost
their kids in that fire.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.800
That's a whole
world of grief,

06:53.800 --> 06:55.000
And for a few...

06:56.200 --> 06:58.100
Suicide's their only way out.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.100
Or someone decided it was.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.600
And made it look this way?

07:01.700 --> 07:03.000
What if they have?

07:09.100 --> 07:11.200
Then we're looking for
one very smart unsub.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.000
Who targets people
in grief.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.500
And that would
make them what?

07:14.900 --> 07:15.600
Someone who thinks

07:15.600 --> 07:17.500
They're putting them
out of their misery.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.200
An angel of death.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.400
Agent jareau?

07:31.700 --> 07:33.500
Hi. I'm detective
ronnie baleman.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.600
Hi. This is ssa rossi,

07:35.600 --> 07:38.200
Ssas morgan, prentiss,
and dr. Reid.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.600
Thank you, all of you,
for coming.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.900
Well, your colleagues don't
look all that happy to see us.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.200
They didn't just
lose a brother.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
I'd like to get started
on all the files.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.500
We're gonna build what we
call psychological autopsies

07:49.500 --> 07:51.400
To determine whether
the victims killed themselves.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.800
Everything's
in those boxes.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.000
We'd also like to take a look
at your brother's house.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I'll take you there.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.800
I think it's better
if you stay here.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.700
It's my case.
I brought you here.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.600
Technically,
there is no case.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.500
If there was,
you wouldn't be on it.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.900
We need to profile
the scene without bias.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.200
I could use your help
with these files.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.000
It looks like
there's quite a few.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.300
My brother kept a journal.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.400
I found this on the desk
in his bedroom.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.400
Read the last page.
They're not the words
of a suicidal man.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.300
You seem pretty sure
that an unsub exists.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.100
So are you.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.000
You're here,
aren't you?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.900
He wasn't on
antidepressants.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.500
He wasn't depressed.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.200
Do you mind if my colleagues
take a look upstairs?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.200
Ronnie kept it
exactly as it was

08:43.200 --> 08:44.400
Until you got here.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.300
Tell me about the fire.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.100
It's the annual fall dance
for the kids.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.700
And it's really popular.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.200
It's hard to get tickets.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.500
But the kids love it.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.700
Do you personally know

09:24.700 --> 09:26.400
Any of the other families?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.000
Who lost children?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.200
And who recently
committed suicide as a result.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.400
Just questions.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.700
Ok?

09:46.900 --> 09:49.200
He knows...

09:49.600 --> 09:51.200
Paul wouldn't do this.

09:51.200 --> 09:51.700
What?

09:51.700 --> 09:54.100
Paul wouldn't do this.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.200
Not after all
we've been through.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
He would not leave us.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.500
Not like that.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.000
Go ahead.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.200
Put it up.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.100
This is a physical
representation

10:24.100 --> 10:25.700
Of the 5 equivocal deaths.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.700
Together with the profile
of each case,

10:27.700 --> 10:30.200
We'll build psychological
autopsies of each person.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.500
And this will tell us
if it was suicide
or murder.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.600
Uh, suicide, yes,
murder, no.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.200
And you think it's
a pretty good indicator.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.700
Since its inception
in 1958,

10:39.700 --> 10:41.800
It's proven to carry
a 92% accuracy rate

10:41.800 --> 10:43.400
In cases that have
gone to trial.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.800
Ok, so the door was locked
from the inside

10:47.800 --> 10:49.800
And the wife
broke the door in.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.600
But he could have
gotten out that window.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.100
Well, it's a good
20-Foot drop.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.400
It'd hurt,
but you could do it.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.800
So a toaster was thrown
in the tub, right?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.200
Space heater.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.500
Toaster, space heater.
Did the job.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.800
Hey. It's a 110 outlet
with no gfi.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.200
Go on.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.800
Well, it's a 1930s house,
but it's been remodeled,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.400
With no ground fault
installation.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.700
Yet there was a gfi unit
installed in the kitchen.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.500
I put them
in all my properties,

11:21.500 --> 11:22.900
Especially the bathroom
and the kitchen.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.600
Any surge of electrical
current will shut the power down

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
At the source.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.100
Properties?

11:30.600 --> 11:31.400
Yeah.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.300
How many properties?

11:33.700 --> 11:34.400
4.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.000
Whoever threw the space heater
in this tub

11:37.000 --> 11:38.500
Knew that there was no gfi.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.400
Mm-Hmm.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.000
Come on.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.000
Mrs. Baleman,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.900
What did your husband do
for a living?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.500
He was a contractor.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.600
Well, if these autopsies
prove they weren't suicides,

12:02.600 --> 12:05.100
Then i need to inform
the media right away.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.300
I would err
on the side of caution.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.100
What?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.400
People need to know.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.400
And they will, as soon as
we have absolute proof.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.100
I think the town's been through
enough already, don't you?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.800
Also keep in mind that
if these cases are related,

12:18.800 --> 12:21.000
This unsub's probably
already aware
that we're onto him.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.500
But the community
needs to know

12:22.500 --> 12:24.300
If there's a serial
killer in its midst.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.500
And they will,
as soon as we have proof.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.500
Even if the proof
means another body.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
He's right, you know.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.500
He's also personally
motivated, though,

12:45.500 --> 12:47.900
Which means he's likely
to react irrationally.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.700
If this turns out to be
the work of a serial killer,

12:49.700 --> 12:51.200
The whole town will, too.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.300
You know what i think,
jakey?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.700
Quarterback.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.100
Yeah.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.600
Maybe that's a little
too dangerous.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.000
How about a kicker?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.700
Yeah, a kicker.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.400
Ooh! Looks like
we have a visitor.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.400
Just a second!

13:16.400 --> 13:17.700
Mommy will be right back.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.800
Hey there. Come on in.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.100
Thank you very much.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.900
Say hi, jake.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.900
Can you do that
for mommy, say "hi."

13:37.600 --> 13:39.100
I've got your bag
in the other room.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.200
You ok?

14:42.400 --> 14:44.100
Yeah, i'm good.
Let's do this.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.900
All right, you got a kid.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.500
There's a bad guy
in the house.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.700
What do you do
to protect your child?

14:52.900 --> 14:53.700
Fight.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.900
Not a single defensive
wound on her body.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
Well...

14:58.500 --> 15:01.100
I don't suppose she climbed
up there of her own free will.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.300
Unless
she committed suicide.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.200
She's got a baby
crying for her
in the other room.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.500
Father found him
in the high chair.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.400
Not a scratch.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.400
Remember,
the unsub believes

15:21.400 --> 15:23.000
He's on some kind
of a mission.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.700
The child is of no
importance to him.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.300
You find
a suicide note?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.700
I haven't found one yet.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.200
So what are you thinking?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.700
In every case, there's no
evidence of a struggle.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.100
Or breaking and entering.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.800
I'm going to need
you and emily to contact
all of the families

15:35.800 --> 15:38.900
Affected by the fire
and inform them
what's going on.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.700
They need to be
warned immediately.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.300
So she couldn't cope.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.900
She snapped.
It happens.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.100
It happens every day.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.800
No, not here it didn't.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.300
Emily...

15:52.700 --> 15:54.500
Right now that's
exactly what happened.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.300
Paul baleman's house...
That's what you'd expect

15:57.300 --> 16:00.300
From someone who
was deeply depressed,
deeply traumatized.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.700
Yeah, i know.
I saw it.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.200
Everything past orderly,
everything present
disorderly.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.800
The bookshelf,
the glass cabinet

16:06.800 --> 16:10.400
All had order
when their lives had order,
had meaning.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.000
Everything about beth's home
says she moved on.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.200
Then how did she get up
there without a fight?

16:20.100 --> 16:21.000
Whew... uh....

16:21.700 --> 16:22.800
She was already dead.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.100
Dead weight is a lot
heavier than alive.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.100
Um...

16:28.500 --> 16:29.600
Ok, well...

16:30.300 --> 16:32.100
She can't believe
he's gonna spare the baby

16:32.100 --> 16:33.800
If she does what she's told.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.500
The question is,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.200
How did he get in?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.100
Beth must have let him in.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.500
I mean, she had to.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.400
They all let him in.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.500
So she fixes them drinks,
he drugs her.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.900
That's gotta be it.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.300
Emily, the strange and great,
what can i do you for?

16:57.300 --> 16:58.900
Hey, uh, i'm looking
for a drug

16:58.900 --> 17:01.700
That would temporarily
paralyze or subdue someone,

17:01.700 --> 17:04.599
Not kill them,
but give full control.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.099
Well, i always use alcohol.
Less fuss, way cheaper.

17:07.099 --> 17:10.400
Um, uh, look for something
that wouldn't show up
in a toxicology report.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.900
Ok, got it.

17:11.900 --> 17:12.700
Thank you.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.000
Anything to tell us

17:15.000 --> 17:16.900
Whether these are suicides
or not?

17:16.900 --> 17:19.400
These are some samples
from diedre nollard,
the jumper.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
See, we have
an insurance form,

17:21.400 --> 17:23.200
A letter she wrote
to her neighbor
a month ago,

17:23.200 --> 17:26.300
A birthday card she wrote
to her husband a week ago,

17:26.300 --> 17:28.500
And her suicide note
as found on her body.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
Suicide note matches,
right?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.000
Definitely by her own hand,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.200
But she's professing
regret. Look.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700
"Uh, i'm sorry i let you down.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.800
Please forgive me.
I disappointed you." And so on.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.900
But the handwriting,

17:39.900 --> 17:42.200
The forensic analysis
is saying the exact
opposite.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.000
What do you mean?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.400
Um... well, you see
how the handwriting slants uphill?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.000
It's a clear sign
of optimism.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.800
The same with how
the spacing
is so consistent.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.600
And these long t-Bars...

17:50.700 --> 17:52.500
Those indicate
an enthusiastic person.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.600
Not someone
who would take a swan dive
off a 5-Story walkup.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.300
Look, even if we had
alerted the media...

17:57.300 --> 17:58.300
Now we'll never know.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.000
Like i said,
that's on me.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.200
But, hey,
now we have the proof

18:02.200 --> 18:03.900
That these aren't suicides.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.500
Those notes,
were they coerced?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
If you were to force someone
to write their own suicide note,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.500
These are words
you generally wouldn't use.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.800
I'll take that as a no.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.100
And my brother's journal?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.900
I haven't...
It's extensive. I haven't...

18:15.900 --> 18:16.900
Another no.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.600
Can we inform the media now?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.200
I have.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.400
I need you all outside.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.000
This is ssa aaron hotchner.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
He's just arrived.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
What have we got?

18:38.500 --> 18:41.100
Including extended families,
over 100 individuals

18:41.100 --> 18:43.900
Within the pittsburgh area
were affected by that fire.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.300
So this unsub
is targeting grief, eh?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.000
Grief?

18:47.000 --> 18:47.900
An event.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.900
A single event
in this unsub's life

18:49.900 --> 18:52.200
Led him to end the life
of someone he believes
had to die.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.800
From that moment on,
he created his own sense of morality...

18:55.700 --> 18:57.100
What is right
and what is wrong...

18:57.100 --> 18:59.800
And he rationalizes
what he did,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.400
That first kill
over and over again,

19:01.400 --> 19:03.000
By targeting people
that he believes
can't be saved

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
By anyone
other than himself.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.400
He decides who lives
and who dies,

19:06.400 --> 19:08.600
And this gives him
an all-Consuming
sense of power.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.800
So they're not gonna stop
anytime soon.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.000
Well, that's assuming
there's someone
to actually stop.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.600
And if there is,

19:15.300 --> 19:17.100
He's convinced he's
on a mission of mercy,

19:17.100 --> 19:19.600
And even after he's caught,
he'll maintain
he did nothing wrong.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.200
He.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.100
White male, mid to late 30s,
he's polite, forthcoming,

19:24.100 --> 19:25.600
Doesn't stand out.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.600
And we believe his victims,
these families,

19:28.600 --> 19:30.600
Are all letting him in.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.500
My brother and his wife
weren't letting anyone in.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.600
If anything, they were
closing themselves off.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.100
Well, this unsub
has found a way in,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.100
One that's very hard to trace.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.600
In every case
there was no evidence
of a struggle,

19:43.700 --> 19:45.100
No attempt at escapes.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.100
He finds
a personal connection
and uses it to buy time.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.400
And my officers
need to know this.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.300
We've found...

19:52.800 --> 19:54.000
That angels of mercy

19:54.000 --> 19:56.400
Are often people
in the medical profession,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
Cops.
As well as law enforcement.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.100
Which is why
we're meeting out here.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.500
Now, we're only fishing.
We don't want to point
a finger.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.100
Point it.
I don't give a damn.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.100
If that's
what it's about,

20:06.100 --> 20:07.800
Let us figure out
where to point it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.300
I asked garcia to check into
emergency responders

20:10.300 --> 20:11.800
Around the scene of the fire.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.700
Good. Prentiss?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.200
He's smart. He knows
all about these
people's schedules,

20:15.200 --> 20:16.600
Their routines.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.600
Look, if this unsub
does exist,

20:18.600 --> 20:20.300
This is a guy
who's all about control.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
He chooses how they die,
when they die.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.100
He even positions them exactly
how he wants them to die.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.500
That makes him
hypervigilant,

20:26.700 --> 20:30.600
A guy who's always
on the lookout,
risk averse, unseen.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.800
The only way to stop him

20:31.800 --> 20:34.800
Is to find out how
he's managed to get into
all of his victims' lives.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.700
We find that out,
we've got our killer.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.700
We can start
bringing people in,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.300
Find the connection.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.800
I haven't had a drink.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.700
It's been 3 weeks...

20:48.800 --> 20:50.000
4 days.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.500
Some of you know
i lost my son... ben

20:55.500 --> 20:56.700
In the fire.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.500
A few of you
have pushed me

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
To go see
his little league games...

21:03.300 --> 21:04.400
His old team.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.600
He used to pitch.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.700
But i gotta be honest,

21:09.700 --> 21:11.900
I just haven't been
up for that.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.000
I drive by every day.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.800
I thought maybe today.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.500
Maybe not.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.500
I don't know.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.700
Thank you for coming.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.700
We're so sorry
about the loss of your son.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.300
I'm sure you know
about the suicides

21:33.300 --> 21:35.900
That have occurred
in shadyside over
the past 2 months.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.800
We believe there's
a serial killer

21:37.800 --> 21:41.200
Who is making it appear
as though his victims
were committing suicide.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.400
Oh, my god.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.800
And he's targeting
people

21:43.800 --> 21:45.500
That were affected
by the fire.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.100
Wh-What do you mean?

21:48.100 --> 21:50.000
I mean, why would someone
do that?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.400
He believes
he's an angel of mercy,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.100
That he's actually
helping his victims move on.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.900
Do you, uh, believe
we may know this person?

21:59.100 --> 22:00.300
Yes, we do.

22:00.900 --> 22:04.700
We just buried our daughter.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.900
Yes, we know.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.700
Whatever
his motivations are,

22:08.700 --> 22:11.200
It's crucial we look into
every part of your life.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.500
Oh, like he's done
or is doing, right?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.300
Um, can you think of
anyone who might want...

22:19.300 --> 22:20.900
Might want to kill us?

22:21.300 --> 22:22.700
They're just
doing their job.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.700
He's a white male,
mid-30s.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.800
He comes across
as very concerned,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.900
Friendly, charming.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.500
No.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.600
I'm sorry.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.200
If you need our help...

22:46.000 --> 22:47.100
For anything.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.000
Thank you.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.700
Did you see her
with her son?

22:57.800 --> 22:58.400
What?

22:58.900 --> 23:00.400
She couldn't hold him.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.600
She couldn't look at him.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.300
Mind if i sit here?

23:12.700 --> 23:14.100
Help yourself.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.300
So you made it.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.500
Yeah, i did.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.300
Face what you fear the most.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.700
Step 10... Continue to take
personal inventory.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.800
Go ahead, hot stuff,
talk to me.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.500
Hey, so,
prentiss was looking

23:55.500 --> 23:58.000
For some narcotics,
my burning love hunk,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.300
And i scored humongously.

24:01.500 --> 24:05.000
I ran every toxicological panel
known to man on the victims

24:05.000 --> 24:07.500
And came up with zilch,
which means he must be
knocking them out

24:07.500 --> 24:09.000
With a neuromuscular agent.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.400
With a what?

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
A paralytic.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.600
Yeah, yeah. Something like
succinylcholine

24:13.600 --> 24:16.800
Or vecuromium, one of those ones
that would metabolize
in the body so quickly,

24:16.800 --> 24:17.900
It wouldn't be detectable.

24:17.900 --> 24:20.600
Plus, plus, also,
and i called me up mr. Coroner

24:20.600 --> 24:21.900
And said, how would you
do this?

24:21.900 --> 24:23.500
And he says, by injection.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.100
So i say, hey, guy,
wouldn't that leave a mark?

24:26.100 --> 24:27.000
And he's all, "hold up."

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And then he goes and looks
at beth smoler's body

24:29.000 --> 24:30.700
And finds the mark.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.400
A hole,
right in her hairline.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.000
Ok, so you have to be
in the medical profession

24:35.000 --> 24:36.700
To get ahold
of those drugs, right?

24:36.700 --> 24:37.600
Not necessarily.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.500
You can get almost anything
online these days.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.000
This drug leaves no trace?

24:41.200 --> 24:41.900
None.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.700
Even if a coroner
was looking for something,

24:44.700 --> 24:46.200
The evidence was gone.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.200
And beth smoler
didn't see anything coming.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.300
No, sir.
She completely saw it coming.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.900
They all saw it coming.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.400
Neuromuscular blockers
paralyze the muscles temporarily

24:56.400 --> 24:58.800
While you remain
very much awake.

24:58.900 --> 25:02.900
He sedates them,
then quickly engineers
their suicide.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.700
Well, if that's true,
it means this unsub's

25:04.700 --> 25:05.800
Not looking for
the glory of the kill.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.200
No, but unfortunately
for his victims,

25:08.200 --> 25:09.700
They're wide awake
when he decides

25:09.700 --> 25:12.400
It's time for them
to move on.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.600
I know that feeling...

25:17.700 --> 25:19.800
When is it ever
going to end?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.400
The sadness,
it just goes on and on,

25:22.400 --> 25:24.700
Every breathing moment.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.200
And the pain,
it overwhelms you.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.700
And if you could end it...

25:32.200 --> 25:33.300
You would.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.000
That's why when you
looked at me, curtis,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.600
I knew in that moment
what you wanted of me.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.300
What you wanted me to do.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.900
I'm only sorry
it took me this long.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.900
But i'm here now.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.500
You can let go, curtis.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.600
I think we're ready now.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.700
Yeah.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
We're ready.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.900
Wo
the barrel was placed
right there,

26:00.900 --> 26:01.900
Under the chin,

26:02.100 --> 26:02.900
He shoots,

26:02.900 --> 26:04.600
And the bullet
went up through

26:04.600 --> 26:06.900
The small and hard
palate of his mouth,

26:06.900 --> 26:09.600
And then it exited
out through his--

26:09.600 --> 26:12.000
Cranium. Check
the back of his head,

26:12.200 --> 26:13.300
His hairline.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.900
There. See it?

26:17.900 --> 26:19.100
Oh, a puncture wound.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.800
Made by a...
Needle.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.200
Did he leave a note?

26:31.400 --> 26:33.000
All right, rossi, i'm in.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.100
We got ourselves an unsub.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.300
They all have
the same type of tone.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.500
It's uncanny.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.800
And you're saying that
they all wrote these willingly.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.900
None of them are forced,

26:45.900 --> 26:48.900
But even here
in curtis fackler's,
he never says goodbye.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.500
It's like they're
not meant for anybody,

26:50.500 --> 26:52.300
Not for a wife,
not for a kid.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.100
Then who are they
writing them to?

26:55.400 --> 26:58.000
They're amends,
to themselves, and i...

26:58.300 --> 27:01.100
I believe they're written
as part of a program.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.600
Program?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The five stages of grief...

27:05.000 --> 27:06.600
In some self-Help groups

27:06.600 --> 27:10.600
They ask you to write down
an amends to yourself.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200
Is that right?

27:17.900 --> 27:20.700
And all of these groups
are anonymous, right?

27:21.200 --> 27:23.400
Well, just to give you
an idea of what we're
dealing with here,

27:23.400 --> 27:26.100
Just for alcoholic
support groups for tonight,

27:26.100 --> 27:29.000
Monday, there are... 91

27:29.100 --> 27:30.300
Around pittsburg proper.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.800
You gotta be kidding me.
That many?

27:31.800 --> 27:32.900
They have different meetings
all day and night,

27:32.900 --> 27:34.700
Different locations,
different degrees
of participation,

27:34.700 --> 27:35.800
Of religiousness.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.700
Ok, i've sent you
a schedule of meetings

27:37.700 --> 27:39.100
For the major grief staples...

27:39.100 --> 27:41.300
Alcohol, drugs,
depression, and loss...

27:41.300 --> 27:44.000
All within a 2-Mile radius
of shadyside. There are 11.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.200
Can we get
a list of names?

27:45.200 --> 27:46.500
Why not?
No.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.400
They're anonymous. That's how
he's been getting away with it.

27:48.800 --> 27:49.900
Let's gather the troops.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.800
We're gonna need
all the people you can spare.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.900
You got it.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.200
Can you think of anybody
who sticks out?

27:56.500 --> 27:58.800
He's confident, earnest.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.700
Mm-Mmm.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.600
Hell, i mean, we're addicts.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.400
Everyone sticks out
and no one sticks out,
you know?

28:08.100 --> 28:10.000
We're just checking
all the different groups
in the area.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.100
This is a really
private group.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.200
Honestly, i don't think
i can help you.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.100
And if i could, i wouldn't.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.900
Even if it means
that one of the members
of your group

28:18.900 --> 28:20.300
Might get killed?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.800
This person has
a specific background,

28:25.800 --> 28:27.000
A tragic event.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.900
He would have felt
compelled to tell his story

28:28.900 --> 28:30.900
And maybe he told it
time and time again.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
That's about
90% of the group.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.200
He might have
brought up suicide.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.600
There has been a lot
of suicide talk lately.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.200
Anyone come to mind?

28:44.500 --> 28:45.600
You know, there was a guy

28:45.600 --> 28:48.100
Who talked about
his brother's suicide.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.300
It was pretty intense.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.600
This guy stood up
and told a story
about his brother.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.700
His family was so poor...

28:55.700 --> 28:58.100
They shared the same bedroom
till they were 15.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.800
We heard
the same story.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.500
He's moving
from group to group,
repeating it.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.500
He said his name was peter

29:04.500 --> 29:05.700
And that his dad was a...

29:05.700 --> 29:07.700
Professor at brassard,

29:07.900 --> 29:09.400
And we were just kids.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.200
Slept in separate beds.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.700
And my father, he'd be
coming up the stairway...

29:17.400 --> 29:21.400
And we'd hear this...
This creaking sound.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.900
It was awful.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.200
And then he would...

29:32.300 --> 29:35.300
He would get in the bed
with james and...

29:35.300 --> 29:36.600
Molest him.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.700
The worst part of it
is that he pretended

29:39.700 --> 29:41.600
To be asleep
when it happened.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.100
If it's true, it could be
what started our unsub
on his mission of mercy.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.900
It certainly
didn't end well,

29:47.300 --> 29:50.600
At least not for james,
the older brother.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.100
Then one night, i, uh...

29:53.800 --> 29:55.600
I came into our room and...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.400
Well, james
had slashed his wrists.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.100
The sheets were covered
in his blood.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.100
It was... It was everywhere.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.500
And then he looked me
in the eye...

30:09.000 --> 30:10.400
And i knew...

30:12.000 --> 30:13.400
In that moment...

30:15.900 --> 30:19.800
I knew... that i just
had to let him go.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.100
Ok, so we've got two names...
James and peter.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.500
And the university...
Brassard.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.400
Well, that'll make it
easier for you, garcia.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.700
If the unsub's father
really taught at brassard,

30:31.700 --> 30:33.100
Chances are he's local.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.600
Reid?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.700
Angels of mercy,
they repeat the same event

30:38.700 --> 30:40.000
Over and over again.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.000
What are you getting at?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Well, if as you said,
the story's true,
then he's leaving

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
One key piece
of information out.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.500
The event that started it all.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.000
His brother didn't
kill himself.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.900
Peter did.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.300
The fire caused
such grief and suffering

30:51.300 --> 30:52.800
That it became the trigger.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.600
And unable to stop himself,

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
He targets someone
he believes needs his help.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.000
At first he keeps to
some kind of timeline,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
A few weeks,
but the last two kills
were within days.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.300
He's devolving.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.300
I got it.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.600
It's from 1984.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.000
It's the brassard college
university newspaper.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
Garcia, they lived on campus?

31:11.200 --> 31:11.800
Yeah.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.900
It says here james redding
was the youngest suicide

31:13.900 --> 31:15.300
In pennsylvanian history.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.700
And his father charles redding
was a professor. Creep.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.200
Is there any possibility

31:21.200 --> 31:22.100
That while
we've been talking,

31:22.100 --> 31:23.600
You've been multitasking?

31:23.600 --> 31:25.100
What, track down
his current address?

31:25.100 --> 31:27.900
Ha ha. I love you,
penelope garcia.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.200
Ha. Get in line.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.900
Clear!

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
We're clear!

31:51.200 --> 31:52.800
Clear!
Clear!

31:52.900 --> 31:54.000
We need to work fast.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
There's meetings taking place
all over the city.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.100
At least
with your guys and ours,

31:57.100 --> 31:58.900
His chances
are next to zero, right?

31:58.900 --> 32:00.300
He's got away with it
this far.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.500
Guys.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.800
You might want
to take a look at this.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.900
He's crossed off the names
of beth smoler
and curtis fackler,

32:12.900 --> 32:14.000
The last two victims.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.100
It's a grid
of all the support groups.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.600
Times, dates.
Got a list of names
of all those in the meetings.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.800
They all have a type.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.100
Alcoholic, narcotic,

32:22.100 --> 32:25.500
Depression, divorce.
Man, this guy
kept himself busy.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.700
Hey. Laurie ann morris.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.500
We spoke to her
and her husband.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
Her name's not crossed off
like the others.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.500
Hi, my name is laurie ann.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.200
Hi, laurie ann.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.500
She's not answering
her cell phone.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.700
The husband's
already left for work.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.100
I'm calling his cell now.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.900
Jonathan, hello.
This is agent emily prentiss
from the fbi.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.700
Is your wife laurie ann
with you?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.700
Can you tell us where
she is right now?

33:05.600 --> 33:06.400
Got it.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.300
Rough day?

33:18.700 --> 33:19.900
You don't have to
answer that.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.200
Oh, tried to quit.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.300
Can't quite
seem to do it.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.300
Maybe now's not the time.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.500
Right.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.200
You'll know when it is.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.300
You have good intuition.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.200
And i can see that.

33:37.700 --> 33:40.000
I'm late.
Nice to meet you.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.100
You, too.

33:47.800 --> 33:48.700
Oh...

33:51.300 --> 33:53.500
Excuse me, sir.
We're looking for either one
of these people.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.800
Have either of you
seen them?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.100
You sure?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.100
All right, let's split up

33:57.100 --> 33:59.600
And search the building
and the surrounding area.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.300
This way, guys.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.199
Laurie ann morris.
Have you seen her?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.699
Please, look close.
She was here.
Are you sure?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.100
Excuse me.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.900
Have either of you
seen these people?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.300
All right, thank you.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.500
Expired.
Triple-A?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.300
I'll figure something out.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.500
She was here
a minute ago.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.400
Where'd she go?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.400
Maybe the parking lot.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.300
Was she alone?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.000
She was talking
to some guy.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.000
Thank you.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.700
Parking lot?

34:58.700 --> 34:59.800
Other side
of the building.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.100
How many exits
does it have?

35:01.100 --> 35:02.700
3. North, east,
and west side.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.200
All right, split up
and cover each one.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.500
Morgan,
you come with us.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.500
Where are you going?

35:08.200 --> 35:09.300
Please, it's no bother.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.300
Where?

35:12.500 --> 35:13.700
Main street.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.900
I'm just going
to meet a friend.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.600
Just hop in the back.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Blue chevy.
Do you know what kind
of car she has?

35:24.300 --> 35:25.300
Wait.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.800
I can help you.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.300
Help me how?

35:32.600 --> 35:35.200
With the pain of not even
being able to hold your son.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.700
You think
you can help me?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.100
Yes.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.200
You just have to let go.

35:45.700 --> 35:46.800
It's over there.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.400
Is that what you did
for all those people?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.200
Laurie ann!

35:52.200 --> 35:54.400
Yes. I did
what they couldn't.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.600
You think
you can help me?

35:57.600 --> 35:58.700
Laurie ann!

35:59.100 --> 36:01.400
<i>You think
you can help me?</i>

36:02.100 --> 36:03.000
Yes.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.400
Laurie ann!

36:07.000 --> 36:08.100
What are you doing?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.800
Laurie ann!

36:22.800 --> 36:24.400
Morgan: put your hands
where i can see them!

36:24.600 --> 36:25.800
I'm going around!

36:29.300 --> 36:30.500
Show me your hands!

36:30.600 --> 36:32.600
Ok. Don't move.
We've got help coming.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.900
Morgan: do it now!

36:34.200 --> 36:35.100
Yeah.
You got him?

36:35.100 --> 36:37.000
I don't understand
what's going on.

36:37.000 --> 36:37.600
Here.

36:39.000 --> 36:39.700
Ow! Ow!

36:39.700 --> 36:40.300
What's going on

36:40.300 --> 36:42.400
Is you just took
your last breath
as a free man.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.100
Shut up.
I've done nothing wrong.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.400
Ow! Ow!

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
Ow. Uh...

36:59.400 --> 37:00.200
Hi.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.600
You're gonna be ok.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.300
Am i?

37:09.400 --> 37:10.700
Laurie ann...

37:12.100 --> 37:14.900
A mother isn't supposed
to outlive her children.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.600
Yeah.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.100
But she's gone.

37:22.000 --> 37:22.700
Allie's dead.

37:22.700 --> 37:26.500
Please. I don't...
care anymore.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.400
But your son does.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.100
Don't lose him as well.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.800
I wanted to thank you
for all you did

37:59.800 --> 38:02.400
And for believing me
when no one else did.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.700
Ron....

38:04.500 --> 38:05.700
Thank you.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.600
Paul's journal...
I read it.

38:10.500 --> 38:14.500
Ronnie, your brother paul
wasn't murdered.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.800
In peter's apartment,

38:15.800 --> 38:18.000
Unlike all the other
victims,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.400
Paul's name
was nowhere to be found.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.500
I... I don't understand.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.700
You said the psychological
autopsy was inconclusive.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.800
Further analysis
of the journal concludes
it was suicide.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.100
I'm sorry.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.400
You're wrong.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.800
But like i said,
thanks for coming.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.700
"the most
authentic thing about us

38:47.700 --> 38:50.900
"Is our capacity
to create, to overcome,

38:50.900 --> 38:53.500
"To endure, to transform,

38:53.500 --> 38:56.700
To love, and to be greater
than our suffering."

38:56.800 --> 38:58.000
Ben okri.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.400
How did it go with jack?

39:01.200 --> 39:04.800
I just told him
that i wasn't going
to be around as much.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.300
How did he take it?

39:08.300 --> 39:11.100
He gave me a hug
and he said that everything
was gonna be all right.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.000
Smart kid.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.200
Like his dad.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.100
So tell me,

39:22.100 --> 39:23.400
Back at the house,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.500
When we found beth smoler.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.900
I don't know.
Sometimes i just wonder...

39:31.000 --> 39:33.800
If we're actually
changing anything.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.200
Do you know why
i have 4 properties?

39:42.400 --> 39:43.800
Tell me.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.100
If i'm not kicking down doors,
i'm smashing down walls.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.500
At the end of the day,

39:50.500 --> 39:53.200
They both make me feel
like i'm changing something.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.900
For the better.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.700
Good enough?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.300
Good enough.
