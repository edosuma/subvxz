00:03.834 --> 00:05.375
What are you doing?

00:05.458 --> 00:07.250
Writing a dating profile for my mom.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.959
I need to get her a new boyfriend,

00:09.041 --> 00:12.500
because right now, she has no one
to hover over and control but me.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.291
All I've got so far
is "hovering and controlling mother

00:15.375 --> 00:16.375
looking for boyfriend."

00:18.125 --> 00:20.417
At least your mom still cares about you.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.625
My gestation pod never even
sends me birthday cards anymore.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.375
Thanks for making this all about you.

00:28.792 --> 00:32.166
-(alarm blaring)
-Hey, Key Keeper, what happened?

00:32.250 --> 00:34.542
Is this the work of your nemesis
Slaughter Master?

00:34.625 --> 00:36.250
He's not my nemesis.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.959
Did he tell you he was my nemesis?

00:38.041 --> 00:40.458
I get to decide who my nemesis is.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.583
He turned your leg into the letter "W."

00:45.542 --> 00:48.041
I think he should at least be
in the running for nemesis.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.125
Well, I do hate the guy.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.583
He set a trap and attacked me.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.750
I was able to fend him off
using my Key of Steel.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.792
The key that gives you super strength,

00:58.875 --> 01:00.291
that makes your body hard as steel?

01:00.375 --> 01:03.667
It also unlocks
every bathroom in the world.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.792
Yesterday,
I used one at Buckingham Palace.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.083
I just walked right in.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.750
No one even tried to stop me.

01:09.959 --> 01:13.709
We will get you patched up
and fighting crime ASAP.

01:13.792 --> 01:16.709
Actually, I'm sick of fighting crime.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.834
When my mentor, the seventh Key Keeper

01:18.917 --> 01:21.041
passed the Key of Steel on to me,

01:21.125 --> 01:23.208
I gave up everything to be a hero.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.583
Now I just wanna go back to a normal life

01:25.667 --> 01:27.250
and follow my true passion.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.834
Watching TV.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.667
It's been years.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.750
Is Full House still on?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.000
Give me the key.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.458
Let me be the new Key Keeper.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.083
Bestowing the key

01:39.166 --> 01:40.959
is a once-in-a-generation decision.

01:41.041 --> 01:43.375
I need to find a person
who proves himself worthy

01:43.458 --> 01:45.583
and fearless and honorable.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.542
Okay, I'll prove myself worthy.

01:47.625 --> 01:49.000
What do I have to do? This?

01:51.250 --> 01:52.583
Or this?

01:53.792 --> 01:56.834
Can we discuss this later?
I need to make a phone call.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.208
Also, I'm gonna need someone
to put my kneecap back on.

02:01.750 --> 02:02.917

Mom?

02:57.125 --> 02:59.667
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see you.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.125
That's the outfit you picked out
to wear today?

03:02.208 --> 03:04.542
That shirt does not go with those pants.

03:04.625 --> 03:05.875
Or any pants.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.375
Shouldn't you be at work,

03:08.458 --> 03:11.667
insulting your employees' clothes
and destroying their self-confidence?

03:13.208 --> 03:15.542
That's what's great about being the boss.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.208
I can do whatever I want,

03:17.291 --> 03:20.792
like leave in the middle of the day
to come visit my son,

03:20.875 --> 03:23.667
who should be listening
to those Mandarin tapes I bought him,

03:23.750 --> 03:26.083
instead of reading picture books,

03:26.166 --> 03:27.709
and hanging out with...

03:28.750 --> 03:29.917
cardboard men.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.667
There are cardboard women, too.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.542
Anyway, I see you've gotten a lot of views

03:37.625 --> 03:39.125
on your dating profile.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.333
Actually, that's why I'm here.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.542
To bring you a new shirt...

03:44.333 --> 03:48.250
but also to thank you
for posting that profile for me.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.959
I've met the most charming man,

03:50.041 --> 03:51.834
and we've already been on three dates.

03:52.542 --> 03:55.667
But I just posted your profile yesterday.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.458
I'm a very busy woman.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.375
When I see something I want, I take it.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.542
By the way, I want that.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.125
I'm happy for you.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.375
And I totally understand
if you need to spend less time with me

04:08.458 --> 04:10.250
and more time with your new boyfriend,

04:10.333 --> 04:12.667
because your happiness
means everything to me.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.458
As well it should.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.709
Now, we'll be having dinner
tonight with my new gentleman friend.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.917
I want you to meet him.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.250
-I don't know if that's necessary.
-The meeting is set

04:22.333 --> 04:24.792
for 7:00, but we'll have
a pre-meeting meeting at 6:30

04:24.875 --> 04:26.458
so I can sign off on your outfit,

04:26.542 --> 04:29.125
because of... this.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.166
I don't want this anymore.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.458
Skylar, do me a favor.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.208
There. Now I'm doing everyone a favor.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.250
No. I'm serious.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.375
I need you to train me to be a superhero.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.000
Kaz, you'll never be a superhero.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.250
You don't have what it takes
at being selfless,

04:59.333 --> 05:00.834
clever and virtuous.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.959
Pettiness and jealousy
don't have any place

05:03.041 --> 05:04.333
in the superhero world.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.166
Well, I might be getting powers soon.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.625
The Key Keeper's retiring,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.291
and there's a chance
he'll make me his successor.

05:11.375 --> 05:12.500
What?

05:12.583 --> 05:13.917
Why you and not me?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.625
No fair, no fair!

05:21.500 --> 05:23.959
So much for no pettiness and jealousy.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.834
Okay, Kaz.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.542
I see your point.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.417
And I'm happy for you.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.417
So you'll teach me everything you know?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.709
Absolutely. But first...

05:42.750 --> 05:44.875
Okay. Now I'm ready.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.625
I've set up a practice simulation
to demonstrate

05:48.709 --> 05:50.834
what to do
when you encounter real-life danger.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.291
There's a violent villain
over there about to commit a crime.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.667
The first thing you do
is assess the danger,

05:56.750 --> 05:58.709
then prioritize the situation,

05:58.792 --> 06:00.458
and finally, take action.

06:00.542 --> 06:04.500
Or we can skip the boring part,
and just take action.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.750
Hey, you, baby.

06:10.333 --> 06:13.250
Yeah,
you with the blankie and the pacifier.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.792
You might look all cute and cuddly,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.125
but you're not fooling anyone,
you stupid baby villain!

06:17.208 --> 06:18.041
(baby cries)

06:18.125 --> 06:21.250
Kaz, what are you doing?

06:21.333 --> 06:23.709
The villain is the scary dude
with the giant knife.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.959
That just seemed too obvious.

06:36.709 --> 06:37.959
Remember.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.625
Just relax, be yourself,

06:39.709 --> 06:42.000
and have fun. Shoes.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.041
Hands. Teeth.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.458
Is that what your teeth look like?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.333
Oof. Reminder: get Oliver new teeth.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.667
Oh, here he comes.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.542
Oliver?

07:01.375 --> 07:02.709
You two know each other?

07:02.792 --> 07:04.875
No! Of course not.

07:04.959 --> 07:07.291
I'm just very good
at guessing people's names.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.000
And weights.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.000
Byron. 280.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.250
(clears throat) Well, I thought
you were bringing your son.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.458
He was right behind me.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.458
Oh, there he is.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.125
Sorry I'm late.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.917
There are just so many free samples
on all these tables.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.041
This is my son Alan.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.083
Alan, this is Bridget.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.959
-And...
-Oliver?

07:43.834 --> 07:47.166
Yes. All over.

07:47.750 --> 07:52.375
You have cocktail sauce
all over your face, total stranger.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.542
(cell phone ringing)

07:56.625 --> 07:58.792
Sorry, it's work. I have to take this.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.333
Why doesn't my one favorite boy

08:01.417 --> 08:04.083
get to know my other favorite boy and...

08:05.500 --> 08:07.291
the boy who just ate
that woman's bruschetta.

08:10.917 --> 08:11.917
I don't like it.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.834
Horace, what the heck?

08:17.917 --> 08:19.417
Why are you dating my mother?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.834
It's hard to meet
women in my line of work,

08:21.917 --> 08:23.750
so I tried an online dating service.

08:24.750 --> 08:28.417
When I saw your mother's name,
I knew Bridget was the one for me.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.834
It has the word "bridge" right in it.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.166
Why is Alan pretending to be your son?

08:34.250 --> 08:37.792
Because women are
total suckers for a single dad.

08:37.875 --> 08:42.208
Yeah. We lured your mom right in,
hook, line and sinker.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.709
Of course, I care for her deeply.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.291
In fact, I love her. I love Bridget!

08:51.458 --> 08:53.667
Horace, you can't date my mother.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.333
First of all, it's just...

08:55.417 --> 08:56.834
(shudders)

08:58.458 --> 08:59.959
Plus, it's too risky.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.208
What if she finds out
about the superhero world?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.041
Oliver, I'm a trained professional.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.875
I think I know how to keep from revealing

09:05.959 --> 09:08.041
the existence
of a super-secret superhero hospital.

09:08.125 --> 09:09.333
What kind of hospital?

09:11.291 --> 09:13.834
A hospital to heal my broken heart,

09:13.917 --> 09:16.083
because you've been gone so long.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.959
Aww. You're the man of my dreams.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.083
If I had dreams. I don't sleep.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.834
Key Keeper,
I'm ready to prove my worthiness.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.375
-Actually--
-I'll start by showing that I'm selfless,

09:33.458 --> 09:36.333
by destroying this first edition

09:36.417 --> 09:37.750
Tecton comic book.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.917
My prized possession.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.083
(whimpers)

09:48.166 --> 09:50.208
(whimpers loudly)

09:55.208 --> 09:57.041
Are you okay?

09:57.125 --> 09:58.917
Of course I'm okay. (forced chuckle)

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm superhero material.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.959
I can withstand all pain,

10:03.667 --> 10:05.959
emotional and physical.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.250
Watch.

10:12.583 --> 10:15.709
Who needs television?
I could watch this all day.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.000
But unfortunately,
I've given the key to someone else.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.959
-What? Who?
-Her.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.166
Excuse me. Ew, ew, ew.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.750
I can't believe you!

10:42.834 --> 10:45.667
You lecture me
about the virtues of being a hero,

10:45.750 --> 10:47.333
and then, you totally snake me?

10:47.417 --> 10:49.125
Look, I'm sorry. It's just...

10:49.208 --> 10:50.583
You don't know what it's like

10:50.667 --> 10:52.875
to have superpowers, lose them,

10:52.959 --> 10:55.041
get them back, only to have them tainted,

10:55.125 --> 10:57.959
causing you to almost
destroy everything you care about.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.959
I almost destroyed
everything I care about.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.166
My face.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.583
Look, I know I was wrong.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.125
But can I please keep the key?

11:09.834 --> 11:12.750
It's my only chance
to feel like myself again.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.917
-Fine.
-Really?

11:17.041 --> 11:18.667
Thank you so much.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.875
I guess you did learn something
about selflessness and integrity.

11:23.458 --> 11:24.500
Yes, I did.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.417
At the end of the day,
it's all I really need.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.542
That, and this key.

11:37.583 --> 11:40.625
Wallace, Clyde,
I wanna show off my new superpowers.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.166
You guys in there?

11:50.917 --> 11:51.959
Kaz.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.750
What are you doing here?

11:55.834 --> 11:56.667
Uh...

11:57.667 --> 11:59.834
Just making sure this door still works.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.709
Yeah, still works.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.083
What are you doing here?

12:04.166 --> 12:06.875
I felt really bad
about snaking the key from you,

12:06.959 --> 12:08.875
so I came here to get you a gift,

12:08.959 --> 12:10.792
but the store's closed.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.959
Anyway, thanks for being so cool about it.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.166
(clanking sound)

12:15.667 --> 12:16.917
(clank)

12:18.291 --> 12:19.500
What's that noise?

12:19.583 --> 12:21.792
Um... it's my new...

12:21.875 --> 12:23.208
armor undershirt.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.709
Yeah, it, uh...

12:24.792 --> 12:27.875
it keeps the moisture
in and the danger out.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.542
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:29.625 --> 12:31.583
I have to go scratch my belly button.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.458
It's an elaborate process.

12:41.959 --> 12:44.917
I am Slaughter Master.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.959
I've made it my life's mission
to decimate the lineage of the Key Keeper.

12:49.041 --> 12:53.000
And from what I hear,
the newest Key Keeper is you.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.291
Wow. People are talking about me?

12:57.542 --> 12:59.500
What are they saying? Am I trending?

13:00.375 --> 13:02.875
I don't know what that means.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.375
Now, prepare to perish, Key Keeper.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.458
Go ahead. Do your worst.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.542
I've got the Key of Steel,
so you can't hurt me.

13:16.417 --> 13:19.250
Ow! That hurt.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.208
I don't get it.
Why didn't the key protect me?

13:25.125 --> 13:27.917
Kaz' house keys? He stole the key from me.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.458
Of course, Kaz would have
the one unlucky rabbit's foot.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.959
No, you're my pookie bear.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.417
No, no, no. You're my pookie bear.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.625
-No, you're my--
-Can we just agree

13:51.709 --> 13:53.709
you're both each other's
pookie bears and move on?

13:55.875 --> 13:58.375
Oliver, I know this must be hard for you,

13:58.458 --> 14:01.250
like those first
seven years of potty training.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.375
But Horace is going to be
in our life a lot more now.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.959
And you know who else is gonna be
in your life a lot more now?

14:09.041 --> 14:11.750
Me. Pookie bear.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.000
Just a thought.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.959
Maybe you guys ought to slow things
down a tad. You know what they say,

14:19.041 --> 14:22.542
"A fire that burns too bright
fizzles out too quickly."

14:23.792 --> 14:25.250
My passion for your mother

14:25.333 --> 14:27.542
will burn for a thousand years.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.000
Of course, you'll be dead by then.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.959
But I'll always carry
your picture in my wallet.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.875
Oh, Horace, you have
the most delightful sense of humor.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.417
It's what I love about you.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.917
And what I don't love about you,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.375
I will change.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.834
(feigned choking) Oh, no!

14:54.917 --> 14:57.458
(coughing) I forgot to cut my food

14:57.542 --> 14:59.500
in tiny squares like you told me to,

14:59.583 --> 15:01.208
and now, I'm choking.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.417
He's choking.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.875
Somebody do something!

15:04.959 --> 15:07.500
There's $100 in it for you.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.583
I'll do it for 200.

15:15.542 --> 15:16.875
Oh, thank you.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.291
Oh, thank goodness you're all right.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.166
What did I tell you about choking?

15:21.250 --> 15:23.333
-Not to do it.
-Not to do it!

15:25.041 --> 15:25.917
Sorry.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.667
Don't feel bad, Mom, it's not your fault.

15:27.750 --> 15:28.709
My fault?

15:28.792 --> 15:30.333
I understand.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.417
You're spending a lot
more time with Horace now,

15:32.500 --> 15:34.041
you don't have time to watch over me.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.875
So if that means I choke on

15:35.959 --> 15:37.834
a dangerously large piece of steak,

15:37.917 --> 15:40.250
hopefully there'll be
a stranger nearby who can save me.

15:40.875 --> 15:41.792
Don't worry.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.041
I'll be fine.

15:48.417 --> 15:52.125
Horace, I didn't realize
how much Oliver still needs me.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.083
He's practically incapable of anything.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.709
That's not true.

15:56.792 --> 15:59.166
Horace, can I borrow your lobster claw?
My eye's itchy.

16:00.667 --> 16:01.583
See?

16:01.667 --> 16:03.875
What have I told you about lobster claws?

16:03.959 --> 16:06.375
-Not to put them in your eye.
-Not to put them in your eye!

16:08.750 --> 16:10.583
Horace, I'm sorry.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.375
But between my son, my job,

16:13.458 --> 16:15.333
and the upkeep of my eyebrows,

16:17.166 --> 16:19.750
I clearly don't have time
for a gentleman friend right now.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.834
(Horace) I understand.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.375
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go comfort that person

16:25.458 --> 16:27.542
who's sobbing
hysterically in the bathroom.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.583
I don't hear anyone sobbing.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.417
You will in about ten seconds.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.333
Does this look familiar?

16:52.417 --> 16:53.792
No.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.125
Oh.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.500
Well, it should.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.333
It's the Hammer of Achelon.

17:00.417 --> 17:03.083
The only weapon
that can defeat the Key of Steel.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.875
Say good-bye, Key Keeper.

17:05.959 --> 17:09.125
Did somebody say Key Keeper?

17:09.208 --> 17:10.542
Who are you?

17:10.625 --> 17:13.875
I just said,
"Did somebody say Key Keeper?"

17:13.959 --> 17:15.500
in a way that made it pretty obvious

17:15.583 --> 17:17.250
that I'm the Key Keeper.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.917
I can't believe you stole the key from me.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.208
Be quiet.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.625
I don't care which one of you
is the real Key Keeper.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.041
I'll just slaughter you both.

17:42.417 --> 17:43.583
Hey, Slaughter Master.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.166
Why are you hittin' yourself?

17:53.625 --> 17:56.542
Wait. Is that the Hammer of Achelon?

17:56.625 --> 17:59.166
Finally someone knows what it is.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.500
There's no escape.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.500
This is the one weapon
that can destroy the Key Keeper.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.166
What if I wasn't the Key Keeper?

18:43.709 --> 18:45.875
Oh, I'll take that.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.208
Thank you.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.333
Wow.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.458
Very clever, Kaz.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.583
I was wrong.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.750
You are worthy to be the Key Keeper.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.583
Yeah, you know, I have my moments.

19:03.667 --> 19:04.834
That was not one of them.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.959
Listen,
I'm sorry I snaked the key from you.

19:09.709 --> 19:12.500
The idea of having
powers again was just so tempting.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.709
But I don't want just
anybody's powers to be a superhero.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.875
I want my own. I guess I just forgot that.

19:18.959 --> 19:20.542
Forgive me?

19:21.750 --> 19:23.041
Sure.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.208
You're trying to take the key again,
aren't you?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.834
Maybe?

19:34.834 --> 19:36.625
Hey, Oliver, remember when you said

19:36.709 --> 19:38.834
I would never get superpowers?

19:38.917 --> 19:40.458
Watch this.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.083
I stand by my statement.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.917
-Where's my key?
-Right here.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.041
I'm taking it back.

19:54.125 --> 19:57.291
I've clearly made a terrible mistake
bestowing the key.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.583
I know. Kaz and I were being petty,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.542
and using the key
for our own personal gains.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.083
Neither of us are worthy enough.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.250
Well, that was part of it,

20:07.333 --> 20:09.208
but it's mostly
because Solar Flare told me

20:09.291 --> 20:10.875
she only goes out with superheroes.

20:15.417 --> 20:18.000
Okay, I get it. But just be careful.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.125
Everybody who goes out
with her gets burned.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.458
Horace. Hey, uh.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.125
Listen, I'm sorry for the way
things went at the restaurant.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.208
It's all right.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.375
In fact,
your mother and I talked and agreed

20:32.458 --> 20:35.834
-that it's best if we don't date anymore.
-Oh, thank goodness.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.500
And what we should do
is get engaged, so we did.

20:40.333 --> 20:41.625
What?

20:43.542 --> 20:46.458
Your mother feels that
because your father lives in England now,

20:46.542 --> 20:48.583
that you need a father figure
around the house.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.083
Now, to start helping you,

20:51.166 --> 20:54.041
I took your leftover
lunch from the fridge,

20:54.125 --> 20:57.291
and made it safer and easier to swallow.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.625
That used to be a Philly cheesesteak.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.458
Now it's a Philly cheese shake.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.417
Enjoy, huh?

21:05.375 --> 21:06.917
Oh, and more good news.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.333
After the wedding,

21:08.417 --> 21:10.917
Aland and I are gonna move in
with you and your mom.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.542
Huh.

21:12.625 --> 21:15.000
This is like falling
down stairs that never stop.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.083
I know. Isn't love grand?

21:19.709 --> 21:21.291
Looks like we'll be roomies.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.291
Just to warn you,
sometimes I snore like a hippo,

21:24.375 --> 21:25.875
because when I have scary dreams,

21:25.959 --> 21:27.625
I turn into a hippo.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.625
(theme music plays)

21:57.000 --> 21:58.250
(boing)

22:02.041 --> 22:03.041
(boy) Yes!
